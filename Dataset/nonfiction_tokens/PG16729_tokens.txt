a
prefatory
letter
my
dear
tyndall
i
should
have
liked
to
provide
this
collection
of
lay
sermons
addresses
and
reviews
with
a
dedication
and
a
preface
in
the
former
i
should
have
asked
you
to
allow
me
to
associate
your
name
with
the
book
chiefly
on
the
ground
that
the
oldest
of
the
papers
in
it
is
a
good
deal
younger
than
our
friendship
in
the
latter
i
intended
to
comment
upon
certain
criticisms
with
which
some
of
these
essays
have
been
met
but
on
turning
the
matter
over
in
my
mind
i
began
to
fear
that
a
formal
dedication
at
the
beginning
of
such
a
volume
would
look
like
a
grand
lodge
in
front
of
a
set
of
cottages
while
a
complete
defence
of
any
of
my
old
papers
would
simply
amount
to
writing
a
new
one
a
labour
for
which
i
am
at
present
by
no
means
fit
the
book
must
go
forth
therefore
without
any
better
substitute
for
either
dedication
or
preface
than
this
letter
before
concluding
which
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
notify
you
and
any
other
reader
of
two
or
three
matters
the
first
is
that
the
oldest
essay
of
the
whole
that
on
the
educational
value
of
the
natural
history
sciences
contains
a
view
of
the
nature
of
the
differences
between
living
and
bodies
out
of
which
i
have
long
since
grown
secondly
in
the
same
paper
there
is
a
statement
concerning
the
method
of
the
mathematical
sciences
which
repeated
and
expanded
elsewhere
brought
upon
me
during
the
meeting
of
the
british
association
at
exeter
the
artillery
of
our
eminent
friend
professor
sylvester
no
one
knows
better
than
you
do
how
readily
i
should
defer
to
the
opinion
of
so
great
a
mathematician
if
the
question
at
issue
were
really
as
he
seems
to
think
it
is
a
mathematical
one
but
i
submit
that
the
dictum
of
a
mathematical
athlete
upon
a
difficult
problem
which
mathematics
offers
to
philosophy
has
no
more
special
weight
than
the
verdict
of
that
great
pedestrian
captain
barclay
would
have
had
in
settling
a
disputed
point
in
the
physiology
of
locomotion
the
genius
which
sighs
for
new
worlds
to
conquer
beyond
that
surprising
region
in
which
geometry
algebra
and
the
theory
of
numbers
melt
into
one
another
like
sunset
tints
or
the
colours
of
a
dying
dolphin
may
be
of
comparatively
little
service
in
the
cold
domain
mostly
lighted
by
the
moon
some
say
of
philosophy
and
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
does
our
friend
seem
to
me
to
fall
into
the
position
of
one
of
those
verst√§ndige
leute
about
whom
he
makes
so
apt
a
quotation
from
goethe
surely
he
has
not
duly
considered
two
points
the
first
that
i
am
in
no
way
answerable
for
the
origination
of
the
doctrine
he
criticises
and
the
second
that
if
we
are
to
employ
the
terms
observation
induction
and
experiment
in
the
sense
in
which
he
uses
them
logic
is
as
much
an
observational
inductive
and
experimental
science
as
mathematics
and
that
i
confess
appears
to
me
to
be
a
ad
of
his
argument
thirdly
the
essay
on
the
physical
basis
of
life
was
intended
to
contain
a
plain
and
untechnical
statement
of
one
of
the
great
tendencies
of
modern
biological
thought
accompanied
by
a
protest
from
the
philosophical
side
against
what
is
commonly
called
materialism
the
result
of
my
efforts
i
find
to
be
that
i
am
generally
credited
with
having
invented
protoplasm
in
the
interests
of
materialism
my
unlucky
lay
sermon
has
been
attacked
by
microscopists
ignorant
alike
of
biology
and
philosophy
by
philosophers
not
very
learned
in
either
biology
or
microscopy
by
clergymen
of
several
denominations
and
by
some
few
writers
who
have
taken
the
trouble
to
understand
the
subject
i
trust
that
these
last
will
believe
that
i
leave
the
essay
unaltered
from
no
want
of
respectful
attention
to
all
they
have
said
fourthly
i
wish
to
refer
all
who
are
interested
in
the
topics
discussed
in
my
address
on
geological
reform
to
the
reply
with
which
sir
william
thomson
has
honoured
me
and
lastly
let
me
say
that
i
reprint
the
review
of
the
origin
of
species
simply
because
it
has
been
cited
as
mine
by
a
late
president
of
the
geological
society
if
you
find
its
phraseology
in
some
places
to
be
more
vigorous
than
seems
needful
recollect
that
it
was
written
in
the
heat
of
our
first
battles
over
the
novum
organon
of
biology
that
we
were
all
ten
years
younger
in
those
days
and
last
but
not
least
that
it
was
not
published
until
it
had
been
submitted
to
the
revision
of
a
friend
for
whose
judgment
i
had
then
as
i
have
now
the
greatest
respect
ever
my
dear
tyndall
yours

i
on
the
advisableness
of
improving
natural
knowledge
this
time
two
hundred
years
ago
in
the
beginning
of
january
those
of
our
forefathers
who
inhabited
this
great
and
ancient
city
took
breath
between
the
shocks
of
two
fearful
calamities
one
not
quite
past
although
its
fury
had
abated
the
other
to
come
within
a
few
yards
of
the
very
spot
on
which
we
are
assembled
so
the
tradition
runs
that
painful
and
deadly
malady
the
plague
appeared
in
the
latter
months
of
and
though
no
new
visitor
smote
the
people
of
england
and
especially
of
her
capital
with
a
violence
unknown
before
in
the
course
of
the
following
year
the
hand
of
a
master
has
pictured
what
happened
in
those
dismal
months
and
in
that
truest
of
fictions
the
history
of
the
plague
year
defoe
shows
death
with
every
accompaniment
of
pain
and
terror
stalking
through
the
narrow
streets
of
old
london
and
changing
their
busy
hum
into
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
wailing
of
the
mourners
of
fifty
thousand
dead
by
the
woful
denunciations
and
mad
prayers
of
fanatics
and
by
the
madder
yells
of
despairing
profligates
but
about
this
time
in
the
had
sunk
to
nearly
its
ordinary
amount
a
case
of
plague
occurred
only
here
and
there
and
the
richer
citizens
who
had
flown
from
the
pest
had
returned
to
their
dwellings
the
remnant
of
the
people
began
to
toil
at
the
accustomed
round
of
duty
or
of
pleasure
and
the
stream
of
city
life
bid
fair
to
flow
back
along
its
old
bed
with
renewed
and
uninterrupted
vigour
the
newly
kindled
hope
was
deceitful
the
great
plague
indeed
returned
no
more
but
what
it
had
done
for
the
londoners
the
great
fire
which
broke
out
in
the
autumn
of
did
for
london
and
in
september
of
that
year
a
heap
of
ashes
and
the
indestructible
energy
of
the
people
were
all
that
remained
of
the
glory
of
of
the
city
within
the
walls
our
forefathers
had
their
own
ways
of
accounting
for
each
of
these
calamities
they
submitted
to
the
plague
in
humility
and
in
penitence
for
they
believed
it
to
be
the
judgment
of
god
but
towards
the
fire
they
were
furiously
indignant
interpreting
it
as
the
effect
of
the
malice
of
man
as
the
work
of
the
republicans
or
of
the
papists
according
as
their
prepossessions
ran
in
favour
of
loyalty
or
of
puritanism
it
would
i
fancy
have
fared
but
ill
with
one
who
standing
where
i
now
stand
in
what
was
then
a
thickly
peopled
and
fashionable
part
of
london
should
have
broached
to
our
ancestors
the
doctrine
which
i
now
propound
to
you
that
all
their
hypotheses
were
alike
wrong
that
the
plague
was
no
more
in
their
sense
divine
judgment
than
the
fire
was
the
work
of
any
political
or
of
any
religious
sect
but
that
they
were
themselves
the
authors
of
both
plague
and
fire
and
that
they
must
look
to
themselves
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
calamities
to
all
appearance
so
peculiarly
beyond
the
reach
of
human
control
so
evidently
the
result
of
the
wrath
of
god
or
of
the
craft
and
subtlety
of
an
enemy
and
one
may
picture
to
oneself
how
harmoniously
the
holy
cursing
of
the
puritan
of
that
day
would
have
chimed
in
with
the
unholy
cursing
and
the
crackling
wit
of
the
rochesters
and
sedleys
and
with
the
revilings
of
the
political
fanatics
if
my
imaginary
plain
dealer
had
gone
on
to
say
that
if
the
return
of
such
misfortunes
were
ever
rendered
impossible
it
would
not
be
in
virtue
of
the
victory
of
the
faith
of
laud
or
of
that
of
milton
and
as
little
by
the
triumph
of
republicanism
as
by
that
of
monarchy
but
that
the
one
thing
needful
for
compassing
this
end
was
that
the
people
of
england
should
second
the
efforts
of
an
insignificant
corporation
the
establishment
of
which
a
few
years
before
the
epoch
of
the
great
plague
and
the
great
fire
had
been
as
little
noticed
as
they
were
conspicuous
some
twenty
years
before
the
outbreak
of
the
plague
a
few
calm
and
thoughtful
students
banded
themselves
together
for
the
purpose
as
they
phrased
it
of
improving
natural
knowledge
the
ends
they
proposed
to
attain
can
not
be
stated
more
clearly
than
in
the
words
of
one
of
the
founders
of
the
organization
our
business
was
precluding
matters
of
theology
and
state
affairs
to
discourse
and
consider
of
philosophical
enquiries
and
such
as
related
thereunto
as
physick
anatomy
geometry
astronomy
navigation
staticks
magneticks
chymicks
mechanicks
and
natural
experiments
with
the
state
of
these
studies
and
their
cultivation
at
home
and
abroad
we
then
discoursed
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
the
valves
in
the
veins
the
ven√¶
lacte√¶
the
lymphatic
vessels
the
copernican
hypothesis
the
nature
of
comets
and
new
stars
the
satellites
of
jupiter
the
oval
shape
as
it
then
appeared
of
saturn
the
spots
on
the
sun
and
its
turning
on
its
own
axis
the
inequalities
and
selenography
of
the
moon
the
several
phases
of
venus
and
mercury
the
improvement
of
telescopes
and
grinding
of
glasses
for
that
purpose
the
weight
of
air
the
possibility
or
impossibility
of
vacuities
and
nature
abhorrence
thereof
the
torricellian
experiment
in
quicksilver
the
descent
of
heavy
bodies
and
the
degree
of
acceleration
therein
with
divers
other
things
of
like
nature
some
of
which
were
then
but
new
discoveries
and
others
not
so
generally
known
and
embraced
as
now
they
are
with
other
things
appertaining
to
what
hath
been
called
the
new
philosophy
which
from
the
times
of
galileo
at
florence
and
sir
francis
bacon
lord
verulam
in
england
hath
been
much
cultivated
in
italy
france
germany
and
other
parts
abroad
as
well
as
with
us
in
england
the
learned
wallis
writing
in
narrates
in
these
words
what
happened
half
a
century
before
or
about
the
associates
met
at
oxford
in
the
rooms
of
wilkins
who
was
destined
to
become
a
bishop
and
subsequently
coming
together
in
london
they
attracted
the
notice
of
the
king
and
it
is
a
strange
evidence
of
the
taste
for
knowledge
which
the
most
obviously
worthless
of
the
stuarts
shared
with
his
father
and
grandfather
that
charles
the
second
was
not
content
with
saying
witty
things
about
his
philosophers
but
did
wise
things
with
regard
to
them
for
he
not
only
bestowed
upon
them
such
attention
as
he
could
spare
from
his
poodles
and
his
mistresses
but
being
in
his
usual
state
of
impecuniosity
begged
for
them
of
the
duke
of
ormond
and
that
step
being
without
effect
gave
them
chelsea
college
a
charter
and
a
mace
crowning
his
favours
in
the
best
way
they
could
be
crowned
by
burdening
them
no
further
with
royal
patronage
or
state
interference
thus
it
was
that
the
young
men
studious
of
the
new
philosophy
who
met
in
one
another
lodgings
in
oxford
or
in
london
in
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
grew
in
numerical
and
in
real
strength
until
in
its
latter
part
the
royal
society
for
the
improvement
of
natural
knowledge
had
already
become
famous
and
had
acquired
a
claim
upon
the
veneration
of
englishmen
which
it
has
ever
since
retained
as
the
principal
focus
of
scientific
activity
in
our
islands
and
the
chief
champion
of
the
cause
it
was
formed
to
support
it
was
by
the
aid
of
the
royal
society
that
newton
published
his
principia
if
all
the
books
in
the
world
except
the
philosophical
transactions
were
destroyed
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
foundations
of
physical
science
would
remain
unshaken
and
that
the
vast
intellectual
progress
of
the
last
two
centuries
would
be
largely
though
incompletely
recorded
nor
have
any
signs
of
halting
or
of
decrepitude
manifested
themselves
in
our
own
times
as
in
wallis
days
so
in
these
our
business
is
precluding
theology
and
state
affairs
to
discourse
and
consider
of
philosophical
enquiries
but
our
mathematick
is
one
which
newton
would
have
to
go
to
school
to
learn
our
staticks
mechanicks
magneticks
chymicks
and
natural
experiments
constitute
a
mass
of
physical
and
chemical
knowledge
a
glimpse
at
which
would
compensate
galileo
for
the
doings
of
a
score
of
inquisitorial
cardinals
our
physick
and
anatomy
have
embraced
such
infinite
varieties
of
being
have
laid
open
such
new
worlds
in
time
and
space
have
grappled
not
unsuccessfully
with
such
complex
problems
that
the
eyes
of
vesalius
and
of
harvey
might
be
dazzled
by
the
sight
of
the
tree
that
has
grown
out
of
their
grain
of
mustard
seed
the
fact
is
perhaps
rather
too
much
than
too
little
forced
upon
notice
nowadays
that
all
this
marvellous
intellectual
growth
has
a
no
less
wonderful
expression
in
practical
life
and
that
in
this
respect
if
in
no
other
the
movement
symbolized
by
the
progress
of
the
royal
society
stands
without
a
parallel
in
the
history
of
mankind
a
series
of
volumes
as
bulky
as
the
transactions
of
the
royal
society
might
possibly
be
filled
with
the
subtle
speculations
of
the
schoolmen
not
improbably
the
obtaining
a
mastery
over
the
products
of
medi√¶val
thought
might
necessitate
an
even
greater
expenditure
of
time
and
of
energy
than
the
acquirement
of
the
new
philosophy
but
though
such
work
engrossed
the
best
intellects
of
europe
for
a
longer
time
than
has
elapsed
since
the
great
fire
its
effects
were
writ
in
water
so
far
as
our
social
state
is
concerned
on
the
other
hand
if
the
noble
first
president
of
the
royal
society
could
revisit
the
upper
air
and
once
more
gladden
his
eyes
with
a
sight
of
the
familiar
mace
he
would
find
himself
in
the
midst
of
a
material
civilization
more
different
from
that
of
his
day
than
that
of
the
seventeenth
was
from
that
of
the
first
century
and
if
lord
brouncker
native
sagacity
had
not
deserted
his
ghost
he
would
need
no
long
reflection
to
discover
that
all
these
great
ships
these
railways
these
telegraphs
these
factories
these
printing
presses
without
which
the
whole
fabric
of
modern
english
society
would
collapse
into
a
mass
of
stagnant
and
starving
pauperism
that
all
these
pillars
of
our
state
are
but
the
ripples
and
the
bubbles
upon
the
surface
of
that
great
spiritual
stream
the
springs
of
which
only
he
and
his
fellows
were
privileged
to
see
and
seeing
to
recognise
as
that
which
it
behoved
them
above
all
things
to
keep
pure
and
undefiled
it
may
not
be
too
great
a
flight
of
imagination
to
conceive
our
noble
not
forgetful
of
the
great
troubles
of
his
own
day
and
anxious
to
know
how
often
london
had
been
burned
down
since
his
time
and
how
often
the
plague
had
carried
off
its
thousands
he
would
have
to
learn
that
although
london
contains
tenfold
the
inflammable
matter
that
it
did
in
though
not
content
with
filling
our
rooms
with
woodwork
and
light
draperies
we
must
needs
lead
inflammable
and
explosive
gases
into
every
corner
of
our
streets
and
houses
we
never
allow
even
a
street
to
burn
down
and
if
he
asked
how
this
had
come
about
we
should
have
to
explain
that
the
improvement
of
natural
knowledge
has
furnished
us
with
dozens
of
machines
for
throwing
water
upon
fires
anyone
of
which
would
have
furnished
the
ingenious
hooke
the
first
curator
and
experimenter
of
the
royal
society
with
ample
materials
for
discourse
before
half
a
dozen
meetings
of
that
body
and
that
to
say
truth
except
for
the
progress
of
natural
knowledge
we
should
not
have
been
able
to
make
even
the
tools
by
which
these
machines
are
constructed
and
further
it
would
be
necessary
to
add
that
although
severe
fires
sometimes
occur
and
inflict
great
damage
the
loss
is
very
generally
compensated
by
societies
the
operations
of
which
have
been
rendered
possible
only
by
the
progress
of
natural
knowledge
in
the
direction
of
mathematics
and
the
accumulation
of
wealth
in
virtue
of
other
natural
knowledge
but
the
plague
my
lord
brouncker
observation
would
not
i
fear
lead
him
to
think
that
englishmen
of
the
nineteenth
century
are
purer
in
life
or
more
fervent
in
religious
faith
than
the
generation
which
could
produce
a
boyle
an
evelyn
and
a
milton
he
might
find
the
mud
of
society
at
the
bottom
instead
of
at
the
top
but
i
fear
that
the
sum
total
would
be
as
deserving
of
swift
judgment
as
at
the
time
of
the
restoration
and
it
would
be
our
duty
to
explain
once
more
and
this
time
not
without
shame
that
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
is
the
improvement
of
our
faith
nor
that
of
our
morals
which
keeps
the
plague
from
our
city
but
again
that
it
is
the
improvement
of
our
natural
knowledge
we
have
learned
that
pestilences
will
only
take
up
their
abode
among
those
who
have
prepared
unswept
and
ungarnished
residences
for
them
their
cities
must
have
narrow
unwatered
streets
foul
with
accumulated
garbage
their
houses
must
be
their
subjects
must
be
the
london
of
was
such
a
city
the
cities
of
the
east
where
plague
has
an
enduring
dwelling
are
such
cities
we
in
later
times
have
learned
somewhat
of
nature
and
partly
obey
her
because
of
this
partial
improvement
of
our
natural
knowledge
and
of
that
fractional
obedience
we
have
no
plague
because
that
knowledge
is
still
very
imperfect
and
that
obedience
yet
incomplete
typhus
is
our
companion
and
cholera
our
visitor
but
it
is
not
presumptuous
to
express
the
belief
that
when
our
knowledge
is
more
complete
and
our
obedience
the
expression
of
our
knowledge
london
will
count
her
centuries
of
freedom
from
typhus
and
cholera
as
she
now
gratefully
reckons
her
two
hundred
years
of
ignorance
of
that
plague
which
swooped
upon
her
thrice
in
the
first
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
surely
there
is
nothing
in
these
explanations
which
is
not
fully
borne
out
by
the
facts
surely
the
principles
involved
in
them
are
now
admitted
among
the
fixed
beliefs
of
all
thinking
men
surely
it
is
true
that
our
countrymen
are
less
subject
to
fire
famine
pestilence
and
all
the
evils
which
result
from
a
want
of
command
over
and
due
anticipation
of
the
course
of
nature
than
were
the
countrymen
of
milton
and
health
wealth
and
are
more
abundant
with
us
than
with
them
but
no
less
certainly
is
the
difference
due
to
the
improvement
of
our
knowledge
of
nature
and
the
extent
to
which
that
improved
knowledge
has
been
incorporated
with
the
household
words
of
men
and
has
supplied
the
springs
of
their
daily
actions
granting
for
a
moment
then
the
truth
of
that
which
the
depreciators
of
natural
knowledge
are
so
fond
of
urging
that
its
improvement
can
only
add
to
the
resources
of
our
material
civilization
admitting
it
to
be
possible
that
the
founders
of
the
royal
society
themselves
looked
for
no
other
reward
than
this
i
can
not
confess
that
i
was
guilty
of
exaggeration
when
i
hinted
that
to
him
who
had
the
gift
of
distinguishing
between
prominent
events
and
important
events
the
origin
of
a
combined
effort
on
the
part
of
mankind
to
improve
natural
knowledge
might
have
loomed
larger
than
the
plague
and
have
outshone
the
glare
of
the
fire
as
a
something
fraught
with
a
wealth
of
beneficence
to
mankind
in
comparison
with
which
the
damage
done
by
those
ghastly
evils
would
shrink
into
insignificance
it
is
very
certain
that
for
every
victim
slain
by
the
plague
hundreds
of
mankind
exist
and
find
a
fair
share
of
happiness
in
the
world
by
the
aid
of
the
spinning
jenny
and
the
great
fire
at
its
worst
could
not
have
burned
the
supply
of
coal
the
daily
working
of
which
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
made
possible
by
the
steam
pump
gives
rise
to
an
amount
of
wealth
to
which
the
millions
lost
in
old
london
are
but
as
an
old
song
but
spinning
jenny
and
steam
pump
are
after
all
but
toys
possessing
an
accidental
value
and
natural
knowledge
creates
multitudes
of
more
subtle
contrivances
the
praises
of
which
do
not
happen
to
be
sung
because
they
are
not
directly
convertible
into
instruments
for
creating
wealth
when
i
contemplate
natural
knowledge
squandering
such
gifts
among
men
the
only
appropriate
comparison
i
can
find
for
her
is
to
liken
her
to
such
a
peasant
woman
as
one
sees
in
the
alps
striding
ever
upward
heavily
burdened
and
with
mind
bent
only
on
her
home
but
yet
without
effort
and
without
thought
knitting
for
her
children
now
stockings
are
good
and
comfortable
things
and
the
children
will
undoubtedly
be
much
the
better
for
them
but
surely
it
would
be
to
say
the
least
of
it
to
depreciate
this
toiling
mother
as
a
mere
a
mere
provider
of
physical
comforts
however
there
are
blind
leaders
of
the
blind
and
not
a
few
of
them
who
take
this
view
of
natural
knowledge
and
can
see
nothing
in
the
bountiful
mother
of
humanity
but
a
sort
of
machine
according
to
them
the
improvement
of
natural
knowledge
always
has
been
and
always
must
be
synonymous
with
no
more
than
the
improvement
of
the
material
resources
and
the
increase
of
the
gratifications
of
men
natural
knowledge
is
in
their
eyes
no
real
mother
of
mankind
bringing
them
up
with
kindness
and
if
need
be
with
sternness
in
the
way
they
should
go
and
instructing
them
in
all
things
needful
for
their
welfare
but
a
sort
of
fairy
godmother
ready
to
furnish
her
pets
with
shoes
of
swiftness
swords
of
sharpness
and
omnipotent
aladdin
lamps
so
that
they
may
have
telegraphs
to
saturn
and
see
the
other
side
of
the
moon
and
thank
god
they
are
better
than
their
benighted
ancestors
if
this
talk
were
true
i
for
one
should
not
greatly
care
to
toil
in
the
service
of
natural
knowledge
i
think
i
would
just
as
soon
be
quietly
chipping
my
own
flint
axe
after
the
manner
of
my
forefathers
a
few
thousand
years
back
as
be
troubled
with
the
endless
malady
of
thought
which
now
infests
us
all
for
such
reward
but
i
venture
to
say
that
such
views
are
contrary
alike
to
reason
and
to
fact
those
who
discourse
in
such
fashion
seem
to
me
to
be
so
intent
upon
trying
to
see
what
is
above
nature
or
what
is
behind
her
that
they
are
blind
to
what
stares
them
in
the
face
in
her
i
should
not
venture
to
speak
thus
strongly
if
my
justification
were
not
to
be
found
in
the
simplest
and
most
obvious
facts
if
it
needed
more
than
an
appeal
to
the
most
notorious
truths
to
justify
my
assertion
that
the
improvement
of
natural
knowledge
whatever
direction
it
has
taken
and
however
low
the
aims
of
those
who
may
have
commenced
it
has
not
only
conferred
practical
benefits
on
men
but
in
so
doing
has
effected
a
revolution
in
their
conceptions
of
the
universe
and
of
themselves
and
has
profoundly
altered
their
modes
of
thinking
and
their
views
of
right
and
wrong
i
say
that
natural
knowledge
seeking
to
satisfy
natural
wants
has
found
the
ideas
which
can
alone
still
spiritual
cravings
i
say
that
natural
knowledge
in
desiring
to
ascertain
the
laws
of
comfort
has
been
driven
to
discover
those
of
conduct
and
to
lay
the
foundations
of
a
new
morality
let
us
take
these
points
separately
and
first
what
great
ideas
has
natural
knowledge
introduced
into
men
minds
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
foundations
of
all
natural
knowledge
were
laid
when
the
reason
of
man
first
came
face
to
face
with
the
facts
of
nature
when
the
savage
first
learned
that
the
fingers
of
one
hand
are
fewer
than
those
of
both
that
it
is
shorter
to
cross
a
stream
than
to
head
it
that
a
stone
stops
where
it
is
unless
it
be
moved
and
that
it
drops
from
the
hand
which
lets
it
go
that
light
and
heat
come
and
go
with
the
sun
that
sticks
burn
away
in
a
fire
that
plants
and
animals
grow
and
die
that
if
he
struck
his
a
blow
he
would
make
him
angry
and
perhaps
get
a
blow
in
return
while
if
he
offered
him
a
fruit
he
would
please
him
and
perhaps
receive
a
fish
in
exchange
when
men
had
acquired
this
much
knowledge
the
outlines
rude
though
they
were
of
mathematics
of
physics
of
chemistry
of
biology
of
moral
economical
and
political
science
were
sketched
nor
did
the
germ
of
religion
fail
when
science
began
to
bud
listen
to
words
which
though
new
are
yet
three
thousand
years
old
when
in
heaven
the
stars
about
the
moon
look
beautiful
when
all
the
winds
are
laid
and
every
height
comes
out
and
jutting
peak
and
valley
and
the
immeasurable
heavens
break
open
to
their
highest
and
all
the
stars
shine
and
the
shepherd
gladdens
in
his
heart
if
the
greek
could
share
our
feelings
thus
far
it
is
irrational
to
doubt
that
he
went
further
to
find
as
we
do
that
upon
that
brief
gladness
there
follows
a
certain
sorrow
the
little
light
of
awakened
human
intelligence
shines
so
mere
a
spark
amidst
the
abyss
of
the
unknown
and
unknowable
seems
so
insufficient
to
do
more
than
illuminate
the
imperfections
that
can
not
be
remedied
the
aspirations
that
can
not
be
realized
of
man
own
nature
but
in
this
sadness
this
consciousness
of
the
limitation
of
man
this
sense
of
an
open
secret
which
he
can
not
penetrate
lies
the
essence
of
all
religion
and
the
attempt
to
embody
it
in
the
forms
furnished
by
the
intellect
is
the
origin
of
the
higher
theologies
thus
it
seems
impossible
to
imagine
but
that
the
foundations
of
all
knowledge
secular
or
sacred
were
laid
when
intelligence
dawned
though
the
superstructure
remained
for
long
ages
so
slight
and
feeble
as
to
be
compatible
with
the
existence
of
almost
any
general
view
respecting
the
mode
of
governance
of
the
universe
no
doubt
from
the
first
there
were
certain
phenomena
which
to
the
rudest
mind
presented
a
constancy
of
occurrence
and
suggested
that
a
fixed
order
ruled
at
any
rate
among
them
i
doubt
if
the
grossest
of
fetish
worshippers
ever
imagined
that
a
stone
must
have
a
god
within
it
to
make
it
fall
or
that
a
fruit
had
a
god
within
it
to
make
it
taste
sweet
with
regard
to
such
matters
as
these
it
is
hardly
questionable
that
mankind
from
the
first
took
strictly
positive
and
scientific
views
but
with
respect
to
all
the
less
familiar
occurrences
which
present
themselves
uncultured
man
no
doubt
has
always
taken
himself
as
the
standard
of
comparison
as
the
centre
and
measure
of
the
world
nor
could
he
well
avoid
doing
so
and
finding
that
his
apparently
uncaused
will
has
a
powerful
effect
in
giving
rise
to
many
occurrences
he
naturally
enough
ascribed
other
and
greater
events
to
other
and
greater
volitions
and
came
to
look
upon
the
world
and
all
that
therein
is
as
the
product
of
the
volitions
of
persons
like
himself
but
stronger
and
capable
of
being
appeased
or
angered
as
he
himself
might
be
soothed
or
irritated
through
such
conceptions
of
the
plan
and
working
of
the
universe
all
mankind
have
passed
or
are
passing
and
we
may
now
consider
what
has
been
the
effect
of
the
improvement
of
natural
knowledge
on
the
views
of
men
who
have
reached
this
stage
and
who
have
begun
to
cultivate
natural
knowledge
with
no
desire
but
that
of
increasing
god
honour
and
bettering
man
estate
for
example
what
could
seem
wiser
from
a
mere
material
point
of
view
more
innocent
from
a
theological
one
to
an
ancient
people
than
that
they
should
learn
the
exact
succession
of
the
seasons
as
warnings
for
their
husbandmen
or
the
position
of
the
stars
as
guides
to
their
rude
navigators
but
what
has
grown
out
of
this
search
for
natural
knowledge
of
so
merely
useful
a
character
you
all
know
the
reply
astronomy
which
of
all
sciences
has
filled
men
minds
with
general
ideas
of
a
character
most
foreign
to
their
daily
experience
and
has
more
than
any
other
rendered
it
impossible
for
them
to
accept
the
beliefs
of
their
fathers
astronomy
which
tells
them
that
this
so
vast
and
seemingly
solid
earth
is
but
an
atom
among
atoms
whirling
no
man
knows
whither
through
illimitable
space
which
demonstrates
that
what
we
call
the
peaceful
heaven
above
us
is
but
that
space
filled
by
an
infinitely
subtle
matter
whose
particles
are
seething
and
surging
like
the
waves
of
an
angry
sea
which
opens
up
to
us
infinite
regions
where
nothing
is
known
or
ever
seems
to
have
been
known
but
matter
and
force
operating
according
to
rigid
rules
which
leads
us
to
contemplate
phenomena
the
very
nature
of
which
demonstrates
that
they
must
have
had
a
beginning
and
that
they
must
have
an
end
but
the
very
nature
of
which
also
proves
that
the
beginning
was
to
our
conceptions
of
time
infinitely
remote
and
that
the
end
is
as
immeasurably
distant
but
it
is
not
alone
those
who
pursue
astronomy
who
ask
for
bread
and
receive
ideas
what
more
harmless
than
the
attempt
to
lift
and
distribute
water
by
pumping
it
what
more
absolutely
and
grossly
utilitarian
but
out
of
pumps
grew
the
discussions
about
abhorrence
of
a
vacuum
and
then
it
was
discovered
that
nature
does
not
abhor
a
vacuum
but
that
air
has
weight
and
that
notion
paved
the
way
for
the
doctrine
that
all
matter
has
weight
and
that
the
force
which
produces
weight
is
with
the
universe
in
short
to
the
theory
of
universal
gravitation
and
endless
force
while
learning
how
to
handle
gases
led
to
the
discovery
of
oxygen
and
to
modern
chemistry
and
to
the
notion
of
the
indestructibility
of
matter
again
what
simpler
or
more
absolutely
practical
than
the
attempt
to
keep
the
axle
of
a
wheel
from
heating
when
the
wheel
turns
round
very
fast
how
useful
for
carters
and
gig
drivers
to
know
something
about
this
and
how
good
were
it
if
any
ingenious
person
would
find
out
the
cause
of
such
phenomena
and
thence
educe
a
general
remedy
for
them
such
an
ingenious
person
was
count
rumford
and
he
and
his
successors
have
landed
us
in
the
theory
of
the
persistence
or
indestructibility
of
force
and
in
the
infinitely
minute
as
in
the
infinitely
great
the
seekers
after
natural
knowledge
of
the
kinds
called
physical
and
chemical
have
everywhere
found
a
definite
order
and
succession
of
events
which
seem
never
to
be
infringed
and
how
has
it
fared
with
physick
and
anatomy
have
the
anatomist
the
physiologist
or
the
physician
whose
business
it
has
been
to
devote
themselves
assiduously
to
that
eminently
practical
and
direct
end
the
alleviation
of
the
sufferings
of
mankind
have
they
been
able
to
confine
their
vision
more
absolutely
to
the
strictly
useful
i
fear
they
are
worst
offenders
of
all
for
if
the
astronomer
has
set
before
us
the
infinite
magnitude
of
space
and
the
practical
eternity
of
the
duration
of
the
universe
if
the
physical
and
chemical
philosophers
have
demonstrated
the
infinite
minuteness
of
its
constituent
parts
and
the
practical
eternity
of
matter
and
of
force
and
if
both
have
alike
proclaimed
the
universality
of
a
definite
and
predicable
order
and
succession
of
events
the
workers
in
biology
have
not
only
accepted
all
these
but
have
added
more
startling
theses
of
their
own
for
as
the
astronomers
discover
in
the
earth
no
centre
of
the
universe
but
an
eccentric
speck
so
the
naturalists
find
man
to
be
no
centre
of
the
living
world
but
one
amidst
endless
modifications
of
life
and
as
the
astronomer
observes
the
mark
of
practically
endless
time
set
upon
the
arrangements
of
the
solar
system
so
the
student
of
life
finds
the
records
of
ancient
forms
of
existence
peopling
the
world
for
ages
which
in
relation
to
human
experience
are
infinite
furthermore
the
physiologist
finds
life
to
be
as
dependent
for
its
manifestation
on
particular
molecular
arrangements
as
any
physical
or
chemical
phenomenon
and
wherever
he
extends
his
researches
fixed
order
and
unchanging
causation
reveal
themselves
as
plainly
as
in
the
rest
of
nature
nor
can
i
find
that
any
other
fate
has
awaited
the
germ
of
religion
arising
like
all
other
kinds
of
knowledge
out
of
the
action
and
interaction
of
man
mind
with
that
which
is
not
man
mind
it
has
taken
the
intellectual
coverings
of
fetishism
or
polytheism
of
theism
or
atheism
of
superstition
or
rationalism
with
these
and
their
relative
merits
and
demerits
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
this
it
is
needful
for
my
purpose
to
say
that
if
the
religion
of
the
present
differs
from
that
of
the
past
it
is
because
the
theology
of
the
present
has
become
more
scientific
than
that
of
the
past
because
it
has
not
only
renounced
idols
of
wood
and
idols
of
stone
but
begins
to
see
the
necessity
of
breaking
in
pieces
the
idols
built
up
of
books
and
traditions
and
ecclesiastical
cobwebs
and
of
cherishing
the
noblest
and
most
human
of
man
emotions
by
worship
for
the
most
part
of
the
silent
sort
at
the
altar
of
the
unknown
and
unknowable
such
are
a
few
of
the
new
conceptions
implanted
in
our
minds
by
the
improvement
of
natural
knowledge
men
have
acquired
the
ideas
of
the
practically
infinite
extent
of
the
universe
and
of
its
practical
eternity
they
are
familiar
with
the
conception
that
our
earth
is
but
an
infinitesimal
fragment
of
that
part
of
the
universe
which
can
be
seen
and
that
nevertheless
its
duration
is
as
compared
with
our
standards
of
time
infinite
they
have
further
acquired
the
idea
that
man
is
but
one
of
innumerable
forms
of
life
now
existing
in
the
globe
and
that
the
present
existences
are
but
the
last
of
an
immeasurable
series
of
predecessors
moreover
every
step
they
have
made
in
natural
knowledge
has
tended
to
extend
and
rivet
in
their
minds
the
conception
of
a
definite
order
of
the
universe
which
is
embodied
in
what
are
called
by
an
unhappy
metaphor
the
laws
of
nature
and
to
narrow
the
range
and
loosen
the
force
of
men
belief
in
spontaneity
or
in
changes
other
than
such
as
arise
out
of
that
definite
order
itself
whether
these
ideas
are
well
or
ill
founded
is
not
the
question
no
one
can
deny
that
they
exist
and
have
been
the
inevitable
outgrowth
of
the
improvement
of
natural
knowledge
and
if
so
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
they
are
changing
the
form
of
men
most
cherished
and
most
important
convictions
and
as
regards
the
second
point
the
extent
to
which
the
improvement
of
natural
knowledge
has
remodelled
and
altered
what
may
be
termed
the
intellectual
ethics
of
men
what
are
among
the
moral
convictions
most
fondly
held
by
barbarous
and
people
they
are
the
convictions
that
authority
is
the
soundest
basis
of
belief
that
merit
attaches
to
a
readiness
to
believe
that
the
doubting
disposition
is
a
bad
one
and
scepticism
a
sin
that
when
good
authority
has
pronounced
what
is
to
be
believed
and
faith
has
accepted
it
reason
has
no
further
duty
there
are
many
excellent
persons
who
yet
hold
by
these
principles
and
it
is
not
my
present
business
or
intention
to
discuss
their
views
all
i
wish
to
bring
clearly
before
your
minds
is
the
unquestionable
fact
that
the
improvement
of
natural
knowledge
is
effected
by
methods
which
directly
give
the
lie
to
all
these
convictions
and
assume
the
exact
reverse
of
each
to
be
true
the
improver
of
natural
knowledge
absolutely
refuses
to
acknowledge
authority
as
such
for
him
scepticism
is
the
highest
of
duties
blind
faith
the
one
unpardonable
sin
and
it
can
not
be
otherwise
for
every
great
advance
in
natural
knowledge
has
involved
the
absolute
rejection
of
authority
the
cherishing
of
the
keenest
scepticism
the
annihilation
of
the
spirit
of
blind
faith
and
the
most
ardent
votary
of
science
holds
his
firmest
convictions
not
because
the
men
he
most
venerates
hold
them
not
because
their
verity
is
testified
by
portents
and
wonders
but
because
his
experience
teaches
him
that
whenever
he
chooses
to
bring
these
convictions
into
contact
with
their
primary
source
nature
whenever
he
thinks
fit
to
test
them
by
appealing
to
experiment
and
to
observation
nature
will
confirm
them
the
man
of
science
has
learned
to
believe
in
justification
not
by
faith
but
by
verification
thus
without
for
a
moment
pretending
to
despise
the
practical
results
of
the
improvement
of
natural
knowledge
and
its
beneficial
influence
on
material
civilization
it
must
i
think
be
admitted
that
the
great
ideas
some
of
which
i
have
indicated
and
the
ethical
spirit
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
sketch
in
the
few
moments
which
remained
at
my
disposal
constitute
the
real
and
permanent
significance
of
natural
knowledge
if
these
ideas
be
destined
as
i
believe
they
are
to
be
more
and
more
firmly
established
as
the
world
grows
older
if
that
spirit
be
fated
as
i
believe
it
is
to
extend
itself
into
all
departments
of
human
thought
and
to
become
with
the
range
of
knowledge
if
as
our
race
approaches
its
maturity
it
discovers
as
i
believe
it
will
that
there
is
but
one
kind
of
knowledge
and
but
one
method
of
acquiring
it
then
we
who
are
still
children
may
justly
feel
it
our
highest
duty
to
recognise
the
advisableness
of
improving
natural
knowledge
and
so
to
aid
ourselves
and
our
successors
in
their
course
towards
the
noble
goal
which
lies
before
mankind

plaintive
inquiry
am
i
not
a
man
and
a

seems
at
last
to
have
received
its
final
reply
the
recent
decision
of
the
fierce
trial
by
battle
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
fully
concurring
with
that
long
since
delivered
here
in
a
more
peaceful
way
the
question
is
settled
but
even
those
who
are
most
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
doom
is
just
must
see
good
grounds
for
repudiating
half
the
arguments
which
have
been
employed
by
the
winning
side
and
for
doubting
whether
its
ultimate
results
will
embody
the
hopes
of
the
victors
though
they
may
more
than
realize
the
fears
of
the
vanquished
it
may
be
quite
true
that
some
negroes
are
better
than
some
white
men
but
no
rational
man
cognizant
of
the
facts
believes
that
the
average
negro
is
the
equal
still
less
the
superior
of
the
average
white
man
and
if
this
be
true
it
is
simply
incredible
that
when
all
his
disabilities
are
removed
and
our
prognathous
relative
has
a
fair
field
and
no
favour
as
well
as
no
oppressor
he
will
be
able
to
compete
successfully
with
his
and
rival
in
a
contest
which
is
to
be
carried
on
by
thoughts
and
not
by
bites
the
highest
places
in
the
hierarchy
of
civilization
will
assuredly
not
be
within
the
reach
of
our
dusky
cousins
though
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
that
they
should
be
restricted
to
the
lowest
but
whatever
the
position
of
stable
equilibrium
into
which
the
laws
of
social
gravitation
may
bring
the
negro
all
responsibility
for
the
result
will
henceforward
lie
between
nature
and
him
the
white
man
may
wash
his
hands
of
it
and
the
caucasian
conscience
be
void
of
reproach
for
evermore
and
this
if
we
look
to
the
bottom
of
the
matter
is
the
real
justification
for
the
abolition
policy
the
doctrine
of
equal
natural
rights
may
be
an
illogical
delusion
emancipation
may
convert
the
slave
from
a
well
fed
animal
into
a
pauperised
man
mankind
may
even
have
to
do
without
cotton
shirts
but
all
these
evils
must
be
faced
if
the
moral
law
that
no
human
being
can
arbitrarily
dominate
over
another
without
grievous
damage
to
his
own
nature
be
as
many
think
as
readily
demonstrable
by
experiment
as
any
physical
truth
if
this
be
true
no
slavery
can
be
abolished
without
a
double
emancipation
and
the
master
will
benefit
by
freedom
more
than
the
the
like
considerations
apply
to
all
the
other
questions
of
emancipation
which
are
at
present
stirring
the
world
the
multifarious
demands
that
classes
of
mankind
shall
be
relieved
from
restrictions
imposed
by
the
artifice
of
man
and
not
by
the
necessities
of
nature
one
of
the
most
important
if
not
the
most
important
of
all
these
is
that
which
daily
threatens
to
become
the
irrepressible
woman
question
what
social
and
political
rights
have
women
what
ought
they
to
be
allowed
or
not
allowed
to
do
be
and
suffer
and
as
involved
in
and
underlying
all
these
questions
how
ought
they
to
be
educated
there
are
philogynists
as
fanatical
as
any
misogynists
who
reversing
our
antiquated
notions
bid
the
man
look
upon
the
woman
as
the
higher
type
of
humanity
who
ask
us
to
regard
the
female
intellect
as
the
clearer
and
the
quicker
if
not
the
stronger
who
desire
us
to
look
up
to
the
feminine
moral
sense
as
the
purer
and
the
nobler
and
bid
man
abdicate
his
usurped
sovereignty
over
nature
in
favour
of
the
female
line
on
the
other
hand
there
are
persons
not
to
be
outdone
in
all
loyalty
and
just
respect
for
but
by
nature
hard
of
head
and
haters
of
delusion
however
charming
who
not
only
repudiate
the
new
which
so
many
sentimentalists
and
some
philosophers
are
desirous
of
setting
up
but
carrying
their
audacity
further
deny
even
the
natural
equality
of
the
sexes
they
assert
on
the
contrary
that
in
every
excellent
character
whether
mental
or
physical
the
average
woman
is
inferior
to
the
average
man
in
the
sense
of
having
that
character
less
in
quantity
and
lower
in
quality
tell
these
persons
of
the
rapid
perceptions
and
the
instinctive
intellectual
insight
of
women
and
they
reply
that
the
feminine
mental
peculiarities
which
pass
under
these
names
are
merely
the
outcome
of
a
greater
impressibility
to
the
superficial
aspects
of
things
and
of
the
absence
of
that
restraint
upon
expression
which
in
men
is
imposed
by
reflection
and
a
sense
of
responsibility
talk
of
the
passive
endurance
of
the
weaker
sex
and
opponents
of
this
kind
remind
you
that
job
was
a
man
and
that
until
quite
recent
times
patience
and
were
not
counted
among
the
specially
feminine
virtues
claim
passionate
tenderness
as
especially
feminine
and
the
inquiry
is
made
whether
all
the
best
in
existence
except
perhaps
the
sonnets
from
the
portuguese
has
not
been
written
by
men
whether
the
song
which
embodies
the
ideal
of
pure
and
tender
passion
adelaida
was
written
by
beethoven
whether
it
was
the
fornarina
or
raphael
who
painted
the
sistine
madonna
nay
we
have
known
one
such
heretic
go
so
far
as
to
lay
his
hands
upon
the
ark
itself
so
to
speak
and
to
defend
the
startling
paradox
that
even
in
physical
beauty
man
is
the
superior
he
admitted
indeed
that
there
was
a
brief
period
of
early
youth
when
it
might
be
hard
to
say
whether
the
prize
should
be
awarded
to
the
graceful
undulations
of
the
female
figure
or
the
perfect
balance
and
supple
vigour
of
the
male
frame
but
while
our
new
paris
might
hesitate
between
the
youthful
bacchus
and
the
venus
emerging
from
the
foam
he
averred
that
when
venus
and
bacchus
had
reached
thirty
the
point
no
longer
admitted
of
a
doubt
the
male
form
having
then
attained
its
greatest
nobility
while
the
female
is
far
gone
in
decadence
and
that
at
this
epoch
womanly
beauty
so
far
as
it
is
independent
of
grace
or
expression
is
a
question
of
drapery
and
accessories
supposing
however
that
all
these
arguments
have
a
certain
foundation
admitting
for
a
moment
that
they
are
comparable
to
those
by
which
the
inferiority
of
the
negro
to
the
white
man
may
be
demonstrated
are
they
of
any
value
as
against
do
they
afford
us
the
smallest
ground
for
refusing
to
educate
women
as
well
as
men
to
give
women
the
same
civil
and
political
rights
as
men
no
mistake
is
so
commonly
made
by
clever
people
as
that
of
assuming
a
cause
to
be
bad
because
the
arguments
of
its
supporters
are
to
a
great
extent
nonsensical
and
we
conceive
that
those
who
may
laugh
at
the
arguments
of
the
extreme
philogynists
may
yet
feel
bound
to
work
heart
and
soul
towards
the
attainment
of
their
practical
ends
as
regards
education
for
example
granting
the
alleged
defects
of
women
is
it
not
somewhat
absurd
to
sanction
and
maintain
a
system
of
education
which
would
seem
to
have
been
specially
contrived
to
exaggerate
all
these
defects
naturally
not
so
firmly
strung
nor
so
well
balanced
as
boys
girls
are
in
great
measure
debarred
from
the
sports
and
physical
exercises
which
are
justly
thought
absolutely
necessary
for
the
full
development
of
the
vigour
of
the
more
favoured
sex
women
are
by
nature
more
excitable
than
men
prone
to
be
swept
by
tides
of
emotion
proceeding
from
hidden
and
inward
as
well
as
from
obvious
and
external
causes
and
female
education
does
its
best
to
weaken
every
physical
counterpoise
to
this
nervous
mobility
tends
in
all
ways
to
stimulate
the
emotional
part
of
the
mind
and
stunt
the
rest
we
find
girls
naturally
timid
inclined
to
dependence
born
conservatives
and
we
teach
them
that
independence
is
unladylike
that
blind
faith
is
the
right
frame
of
mind
and
that
whatever
we
may
be
permitted
and
indeed
encouraged
to
do
to
our
brother
our
sister
is
to
be
left
to
the
tyranny
of
authority
and
tradition
with
few
insignificant
exceptions
girls
have
been
educated
either
to
be
drudges
or
toys
beneath
man
or
a
sort
of
angels
above
him
the
highest
ideal
aimed
at
oscillating
between
cl√§rchen
and

the
possibility
that
the

of

lies
neither

in
the

that
the
female
type
of
character
is
neither
better
nor
worse
than
the
male
but
only
weaker
that
women
are
meant
neither
to
be
men
guides
nor
their
playthings
but
their
comrades
their
fellows
and
their
equals
so
far
as
nature
puts
no
bar
to
that
equality
does
not
seem
to
have
entered
into
the
minds
of
those
who
have
had
the
conduct
of
the
education
of
girls
if
the
present
system
of
female
education
stands
as
inherently
absurd
and
if
that
which
we
have
just
indicated
is
the
true
position
of
woman
what
is
the
first
step
towards
a
better
state
of
things
we
reply
emancipate
girls
recognise
the
fact
that
they
share
the
senses
perceptions
feelings
reasoning
powers
emotions
of
boys
and
that
the
mind
of
the
average
girl
is
less
different
from
that
of
the
average
boy
than
the
mind
of
one
boy
is
from
that
of
another
so
that
whatever
argument
justifies
a
given
education
for
all
boys
justifies
its
application
to
girls
as
well
so
far
from
imposing
artificial
restrictions
upon
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
by
women
throw
every

in

way

let

by

they
will

if

feel

do
so

let
them
if
they
so
please
become

let
them
have
a
fair
field
but
let
them
understand
as
the
necessary
correlative
that
they
are
to
have
no
favour
let
nature
alone
sit
above
the
lists
rain

and
judge
the
prize
and
the
result
for
our
parts
though
loth
to
prophesy
we
believe
it
will
be
that
of
other
emancipations
women
will
find
their
place
and
it
will
neither
be
that
in
which
they
have
been
held
nor
that
to
which
some
of
them
aspire
nature
old

the

the

the

of

will
carry
the

whenever
it
is
worth
their
while
to
contest
the
prizes
of
life
with
the
best

and
the
hardship
of
it
is
that
the
very
improvement
of
the
women
will
lessen
their
chances
better
mothers
will
bring
forth
better
sons
and
the
impetus
gained
by
the
one
sex
will
be
transmitted
in
the
next
generation
to
the
other
the
most
darwinian
of
theorists
will
not
venture
to
propound
the
doctrine
that
the
physical
disabilities
under
which
women
have
hitherto
laboured
in
the
struggle
for
existence
with
men
are
likely
to
be
removed
by
even
the
most
skilfully
conducted
process
of
educational
selection
we
are
indeed
fully
prepared
to
believe
that
the
bearing
of
children
may
and
ought
to
become
as
free
from
danger
and
long
disability
to
the
civilized
woman
as
it
is
to
the
savage
nor
is
it
improbable
that
as
society
advances
towards
its
right
organization
motherhood
will
occupy
a
less
space
of
woman
life
than
it
has
hitherto
done
but
still
unless
the
human
species
is
to
come
to
an
end
altogether
a
consummation
which
can
hardly
be
desired
by
even
the
most
ardent
advocate
of
women
rights
somebody
must
be
good
enough
to
take
the
trouble
and
responsibility
of
annually
adding
to
the
world
exactly
as
many
people
as
die
out
of
it
in
consequence
of
some
domestic
difficulties
sydney
smith
is
said
to
have
suggested
that
it
would
have
been
good
for
the
human
race
had
the
model
offered
by
the
hive
been
followed
and
had
all
the
working
part
of
the
female
community
been
neuters
failing
any
reform
of
this
kind
we
see
nothing
for
it
but
the
old
division
of
humanity
into
men
potentially
or
actually
fathers
and
women
potentially
if
not
actually
mothers
and
we
fear
that
so
long
as
this
potential
motherhood
is
her
lot
woman
will
be
found
to
be
fearfully
weighted
in
the
race
of
life
the
duty
of
man
is
to
see
that
not
a
grain
is
piled
upon
that
load
beyond
what
nature
imposes
that
injustice
is
not
added
to
inequality
iii
a
liberal
education
and
where
to
find
it
the
business
which
the
south
london
working
men
college
has
undertaken
is
a
great
work
indeed
i
might
say
that
education
with
which
that
college
proposes
to
grapple
is
the
greatest
work
of
all
those
which
lie
ready
to
a
man
hand
just
at
present
and
at
length
this
fact
is
becoming
generally
recognised
you
can
not
go
anywhere
without
hearing
a
buzz
of
more
or
less
confused
and
contradictory
talk
on
this
subject
nor
can
you
fail
to
notice
that
in
one
point
at
any
rate
there
is
a
very
decided
advance
upon
like
discussions
in
former
days
nobody
outside
the
agricultural
interest
now
dares
to
say
that
education
is
a
bad
thing
if
any
representative
of
the
once
large
and
powerful
party
which
in
former
days
proclaimed
this
opinion
still
exists
in
a
state
he
keeps
his
thoughts
to
himself
in
fact
there
is
a
chorus
of
voices
almost
distressing
in
their
harmony
raised
in
favour
of
the
doctrine
that
education
is
the
great
panacea
for
human
troubles
and
that
if
the
country
is
not
shortly
to
go
to
the
dogs
everybody
must
be
educated
the
politicians
tell
us
you
must
educate
the
masses
because
they
are
going
to
be
masters
the
clergy
join
in
the
cry
for
education
for
they
affirm
that
the
people
are
drifting
away
from
church
and
chapel
into
the
broadest
infidelity
the
manufacturers
and
the
capitalists
swell
the
chorus
lustily
they
declare
that
ignorance
makes
bad
workmen
that
england
will
soon
be
unable
to
turn
out
cotton
goods
or
steam
engines
cheaper
than
other
people
and
then
ichabod
ichabod
the
glory
will
be
departed
from
us
and
a
few
voices
are
lifted
up
in
favour
of
the
doctrine
that
the
masses
should
be
educated
because
they
are
men
and
women
with
unlimited
capacities
of
being
doing
and
suffering
and
that
it
is
as
true
now
as
ever
it
was
that
the
people
perish
for
lack
of
knowledge
these
members
of
the
minority
with
whom
i
confess
i
have
a
good
deal
of
sympathy
are
doubtful
whether
any
of
the
other
reasons
urged
in
favour
of
the
education
of
the
people
are
of
much
value
whether
indeed
some
of
them
are
based
upon
either
wise
or
noble
grounds
of
action
they
question
if
it
be
wise
to
tell
people
that
you
will
do
for
them
out
of
fear
of
their
power
what
you
have
left
undone
so
long
as
your
only
motive
was
compassion
for
their
weakness
and
their
sorrows
and
if
ignorance
of
everything
which
it
is
needful
a
ruler
should
know
is
likely
to
do
so
much
harm
in
the
governing
classes
of
the
future
why
is
it
they
ask
reasonably
enough
that
such
ignorance
in
the
governing
classes
of
the
past
has
not
been
viewed
with
equal
horror
compare
the
average
artisan
and
the
average
country
squire
and
it
may
be
doubted
if
you
will
find
a
pin
to
choose
between
the
two
in
point
of
ignorance
class
feeling
or
prejudice
it
is
true
that
the
ignorance
is
of
a
different
sort
that
the
class
feeling
is
in
favour
of
a
different
class
and
that
the
prejudice
has
a
distinct
flavour
of
in
each
case
but
it
is
questionable
if
the
one
is
either
a
bit
better
or
a
bit
worse
than
the
other
the
old
protectionist
theory
is
the
doctrine
of
trades
unions
as
applied
by
the
squires
and
the
modern
trades
unionism
is
the
doctrine
of
the
squires
applied
by
the
artisans
why
should
we
be
worse
off
under
one
than
under
the
other
again
this
sceptical
minority
asks
the
clergy
to
think
whether
it
is
really
want
of
education
which
keeps
the
masses
away
from
their
ministrations
whether
the
most
completely
educated
men
are
not
as
open
to
reproach
on
this
score
as
the
workmen
and
whether
perchance
this
may
not
indicate
that
it
is
not
education
which
lies
at
the
bottom
of
the
matter
once
more
these
people
whom
there
is
no
pleasing
venture
to
doubt
whether
the
glory
which
rests
upon
being
able
to
undersell
all
the
rest
of
the
world
is
a
very
safe
kind
of
glory
whether
we
may
not
purchase
it
too
dear
especially
if
we
allow
education
which
ought
to
be
directed
to
the
making
of
men
to
be
diverted
into
a
process
of
manufacturing
human
tools
wonderfully
adroit
in
the
exercise
of
some
technical
industry
but
good
for
nothing
else
and
finally
these
people
inquire
whether
it
is
the
masses
alone
who
need
a
reformed
and
improved
education
they
ask
whether
the
richest
of
our
public
schools
might
not
well
be
made
to
supply
knowledge
as
well
as
gentlemanly
habits
a
strong
class
feeling
and
eminent
proficiency
in
cricket
they
seem
to
think
that
the
noble
foundations
of
our
old
universities
are
hardly
fulfilling
their
functions
in
their
present
posture
of
seminaries
half
racecourses
where
men
are
trained
to
win
a
senior
wranglership
or
a
as
horses
are
trained
to
win
a
cup
with
as
little
reference
to
the
needs
of
in
the
case
of
the
man
as
in
that
of
the
racer
and
while
as
zealous
for
education
as
the
rest
they
affirm
that
if
the
education
of
the
richer
classes
were
such
as
to
fit
them
to
be
the
leaders
and
the
governors
of
the
poorer
and
if
the
education
of
the
poorer
classes
were
such
as
to
enable
them
to
appreciate
really
wise
guidance
and
good
governance
the
politicians
need
not
fear
nor
the
clergy
lament
their
want
of
flocks
nor
the
capitalists
prognosticate
the
annihilation
of
the
prosperity
of
the
country
such
is
the
diversity
of
opinion
upon
the
why
and
the
wherefore
of
education
and
my
hearers
will
be
prepared
to
expect
that
the
practical
recommendations
which
are
put
forward
are
not
less
discordant
there
is
a
loud
cry
for
compulsory
education
we
english
in
spite
of
constant
experience
to
the
contrary
preserve
a
touching
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
acts
of
parliament
and
i
believe
we
should
have
compulsory
education
in
the
course
of
next
session
if
there
were
the
least
probability
that
half
a
dozen
leading
statesmen
of
different
parties
would
agree
what
that
education
should
be
some
hold
that
education
without
theology
is
worse
than
none
others
maintain
quite
as
strongly
that
education
with
theology
is
in
the
same
predicament
but
this
is
certain
that
those
who
hold
the
first
opinion
can
by
no
means
agree
what
theology
should
be
taught
and
that
those
who
maintain
the
second
are
in
a
small
minority
at
any
rate
make
people
learn
to
read
write
and
cipher
say
a
great
many
and
the
advice
is
undoubtedly
sensible
as
far
as
it
goes
but
as
has
happened
to
me
in
former
days
those
who
in
despair
of
getting
anything
better
advocate
this
measure
are
met
with
the
objection
that
it
is
very
like
making
a
child
practise
the
use
of
a
knife
fork
and
spoon
without
giving
it
a
particle
of
meat
i
really
do
know
what
reply
is
to
be
made
to
such
an
objection
but
it
would
be
unprofitable
to
spend
more
time
in
disentangling
or
rather
in
showing
up
the
knots
in
the
ravelled
skeins
of
our
neighbours
much
more
to
the
purpose
is
it
to
ask
if
we
possess
any
clue
of
our
own
which
may
guide
us
among
these
entanglements
and
by
way
of
a
beginning
let
us
ask
ourselves
what
is
education
above
all
things
what
is
our
ideal
of
a
thoroughly
liberal
education
of
that
education
which
if
we
could
begin
life
again
we
would
give
ourselves
of
that
education
which
if
we
could
mould
the
fates
to
our
own
will
we
would
give
our
children
well
i
know
not
what
may
be
your
conceptions
upon
this
matter
but
i
will
tell
you
mine
and
i
hope
i
shall
find
that
our
views
are
not
very
discrepant
suppose
it
were
perfectly
certain
that
the
life
and
fortune
of
every
one
of
us
would
one
day
or
other
depend
upon
his
winning
or
losing
a
game
at
chess
do
you
think
that
we
should
all
consider
it
to
be
a
primary
duty
to
learn
at
least
the
names
and
the
moves
of
the
pieces
to
have
a
notion
of
a
gambit
and
a
keen
eye
for
all
the
means
of
giving
and
getting
out
of
check
do
you
not
think
that
we
should
look
with
a
disapprobation
amounting
to
scorn
upon
the
father
who
allowed
his
son
or
the
state
which
allowed
its
members
to
grow
up
without
knowing
a
pawn
from
a
knight
yet
it
is
a
very
plain
and
elementary
truth
that
the
life
the
fortune
and
the
happiness
of
every
one
of
us
and
more
or
less
of
those
who
are
connected
with
us
do
depend
upon
our
knowing
something
of
the
rules
of
a
game
infinitely
more
difficult
and
complicated
than
chess
it
is
a
game
which
has
been
played
for
untold
ages
every
man
and
woman
of
us
being
one
of
the
two
players
in
a
game
of
his
or
her
own
the
is
the
world
the
pieces
are
the
phenomena
of
the
universe
the
rules
of
the
game
are
what
we
call
the
laws
of
nature
the
player
on
the
other
side
is
hidden
from
us
we
know
that
his
play
is
always
fair
just
and
patient
but
also
we
know
to
our
cost
that
he
never
overlooks
a
mistake
or
makes
the
smallest
allowance
for
ignorance
to
the
man
who
plays
well
the
highest
stakes
are
paid
with
that
sort
of
overflowing
generosity
with
which
the
strong
shows
delight
in
strength
and
one
who
plays
ill
is
checkmated
without
haste
but
without
remorse
my
metaphor
will
remind
some
of
you
of
the
famous
picture
in
which
retzsch
has
depicted
satan
playing
at
chess
with
man
for
his
soul
substitute
for
the
mocking
fiend
in
that
picture
a
calm
strong
angel
who
is
playing
for
love
as
we
say
and
would
rather
lose
than
win
and
i
should
accept
it
as
an
image
of
human
life
well
what
i
mean
by
education
is
learning
the
rules
of
this
mighty
game
in
other
words
education
is
the
instruction
of
the
intellect
in
the
laws
of
nature
under
which
name
i
include
not
merely
things
and
their
forces
but
men
and
their
ways
and
the
fashioning
of
the
affections
and
of
the
will
into
an
earnest
and
loving
desire
to
move
in
harmony
with
those
laws
for
me
education
means
neither
more
nor
less
than
this
anything
which
professes
to
call
itself
education
must
be
tried
by
this
standard
and
if
it
fails
to
stand
the
test
i
will
not
call
it
education
whatever
may
be
the
force
of
authority
or
of
numbers
upon
the
other
side
it
is
important
to
remember
that
in
strictness
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
uneducated
man
take
an
extreme
case
suppose
that
an
adult
man
in
the
full
vigour
of
his
faculties
could
be
suddenly
placed
in
the
world
as
adam
is
said
to
have
been
and
then
left
to
do
as
he
best
might
how
long
would
he
be
left
uneducated
not
five
minutes
nature
would
begin
to
teach
him
through
the
eye
the
ear
the
touch
the
properties
of
objects
pain
and
pleasure
would
be
at
his
elbow
telling
him
to
do
this
and
avoid
that
and
by
slow
degrees
the
man
would
receive
an
education
which
if
narrow
would
be
thorough
real
and
adequate
to
his
circumstances
though
there
would
be
no
extras
and
very
few
accomplishments
and
if
to
this
solitary
man
entered
a
second
adam
or
better
still
an
eve
a
new
and
greater
world
that
of
social
and
moral
phenomena
would
be
revealed
joys
and
woes
compared
with
which
all
others
might
seem
but
faint
shadows
would
spring
from
the
new
relations
happiness
and
sorrow
would
take
the
place
of
the
coarser
monitors
pleasure
and
pain
but
conduct
would
still
be
shaped
by
the
observation
of
the
natural
consequences
of
actions
or
in
other
words
by
the
laws
of
the
nature
of
man
to
every
one
of
us
the
world
was
once
as
fresh
and
new
as
to
adam
and
then
long
before
we
were
susceptible
of
any
other
mode
of
instruction
nature
took
us
in
hand
and
every
minute
of
waking
life
brought
its
educational
influence
shaping
our
actions
into
rough
accordance
with
nature
laws
so
that
we
might
not
be
ended
untimely
by
too
gross
disobedience
nor
should
i
speak
of
this
process
of
education
as
past
for
any
one
be
he
as
old
as
he
may
for
every
man
the
world
is
as
fresh
as
it
was
at
the
first
day
and
as
full
of
untold
novelties
for
him
who
has
the
eyes
to
see
them
and
nature
is
still
continuing
her
patient
education
of
us
in
that
great
university
the
universe
of
which
we
are
all
members
nature
having
no
those
who
take
honours
in
nature
university
who
learn
the
laws
which
govern
men
and
things
and
obey
them
are
the
really
great
and
successful
men
in
this
world
the
great
mass
of
mankind
are
the
poll
who
pick
up
just
enough
to
get
through
without
much
discredit
those
who
wo
learn
at
all
are
plucked
and
then
you
ca
come
up
again
nature
pluck
means
extermination
thus
the
question
of
compulsory
education
is
settled
so
far
as
nature
is
concerned
her
bill
on
that
question
was
framed
and
passed
long
ago
but
like
all
compulsory
legislation
that
of
nature
is
harsh
and
wasteful
in
its
operation
ignorance
is
visited
as
sharply
as
wilful
disobedience
incapacity
meets
with
the
same
punishment
as
crime
nature
discipline
is
not
even
a
word
and
a
blow
and
the
blow
first
but
the
blow
without
the
word
it
is
left
to
you
to
find
out
why
your
ears
are
boxed
the
object
of
what
we
commonly
call
education
that
education
in
which
man
intervenes
and
which
i
shall
distinguish
as
artificial
education
is
to
make
good
these
defects
in
nature
methods
to
prepare
the
child
to
receive
nature
education
neither
incapably
nor
ignorantly
nor
with
wilful
disobedience
and
to
understand
the
preliminary
symptoms
of
her
displeasure
without
waiting
for
the
box
on
the
ear
in
short
all
artificial
education
ought
to
be
an
anticipation
of
natural
education
and
a
liberal
education
is
an
artificial
education
which
has
not
only
prepared
a
man
to
escape
the
great
evils
of
disobedience
to
natural
laws
but
has
trained
him
to
appreciate
and
to
seize
upon
the
rewards
which
nature
scatters
with
as
free
a
hand
as
her
penalties
that
man
i
think
has
had
a
liberal
education
who
has
been
so
trained
in
youth
that
his
body
is
the
ready
servant
of
his
will
and
does
with
ease
and
pleasure
all
the
work
that
as
a
mechanism
it
is
capable
of
whose
intellect
is
a
clear
cold
logic
engine
with
all
its
parts
of
equal
strength
and
in
smooth
working
order
ready
like
a
steam
engine
to
be
turned
to
any
kind
of
work
and
spin
the
gossamers
as
well
as
forge
the
anchors
of
the
mind
whose
mind
is
stored
with
a
knowledge
of
the
great
and
fundamental
truths
of
nature
and
of
the
laws
of
her
operations
one
who
no
stunted
ascetic
is
full
of
life
and
fire
but
whose
passions
are
trained
to
come
to
heel
by
a
vigorous
will
the
servant
of
a
tender
conscience
who
has
learned
to
love
all
beauty
whether
of
nature
or
of
art
to
hate
all
vileness
and
to
respect
others
as
himself
such
an
one
and
no
other
i
conceive
has
had
a
liberal
education
for
he
is
as
completely
as
a
man
can
be
in
harmony
with
nature
he
will
make
the
best
of
her
and
she
of
him
they
will
get
on
together
rarely
she
as
his
ever
beneficent
mother
he
as
her
her
conscious
self
her
minister
and
interpreter
where
is
such
an
education
as
this
to
be
had
where
is
there
any
approximation
to
it
has
any
one
tried
to
found
such
an
education
looking
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
these
islands
i
am
afraid
that
all
these
questions
must
receive
a
negative
answer
consider
our
primary
schools
and
what
is
taught
in
them
a
child
learns
to
read
write
and
cipher
more
or
less
well
but
in
a
very
large
proportion
of
cases
not
so
well
as
to
take
pleasure
in
reading
or
to
be
able
to
write
the
commonest
letter
properly
a
quantity
of
dogmatic
theology
of
which
the
child
nine
times
out
of
ten
understands
next
to
nothing
mixed
up
with
this
so
as
to
seem
to
stand
or
fall
with
it
a
few
of
the
broadest
and
simplest
principles
of
morality
this
to
my
mind
is
much
as
if
a
man
of
science
should
make
the
story
of
the
fall
of
the
apple
in
newton
garden
an
integral
part
of
the
doctrine
of
gravitation
and
teach
it
as
of
equal
authority
with
the
law
of
the
inverse
squares
a
good
deal
of
jewish
history
and
syrian
geography
and
perhaps
a
little
something
about
english
history
and
the
geography
of
the
own
country
but
i
doubt
if
there
is
a
primary
school
in
england
in
which
hangs
a
map
of
the
hundred
in
which
the
village
lies
so
that
the
children
may
be
practically
taught
by
it
what
a
map
means
a
certain
amount
of
regularity
attentive
obedience
respect
for
others
obtained
by
fear
if
the
master
be
incompetent
or
foolish
by
love
and
reverence
if
he
be
wise
so
far
as
this
school
course
embraces
a
training
in
the
theory
and
practice
of
obedience
to
the
moral
laws
of
nature
i
gladly
admit
not
only
that
it
contains
a
valuable
educational
element
but
that
so
far
it
deals
with
the
most
valuable
and
important
part
of
all
education
yet
contrast
what
is
done
in
this
direction
with
what
might
be
done
with
the
time
given
to
matters
of
comparatively
no
importance
with
the
absence
of
any
attention
to
things
of
the
highest
moment
and
one
is
tempted
to
think
of
falstaff
bill
and
the
halfpenny
worth
of
bread
to
all
that
quantity
of
sack
let
us
consider
what
a
child
thus
educated
knows
and
what
it
does
not
know
begin
with
the
most
important
topic
of
all
morality
as
the
guide
of
conduct
the
child
knows
well
enough
that
some
acts
meet
with
approbation
and
some
with
disapprobation
but
it
has
never
heard
that
there
lies
in
the
nature
of
things
a
reason
for
every
moral
law
as
cogent
and
as
well
defined
as
that
which
underlies
every
physical
law
that
stealing
and
lying
are
just
as
certain
to
be
followed
by
evil
consequences
as
putting
your
hand
in
the
fire
or
jumping
out
of
a
garret
window
again
though
the
scholar
may
have
been
made
acquainted
in
dogmatic
fashion
with
the
broad
laws
of
morality
he
has
had
no
training
in
the
application
of
those
laws
to
the
difficult
problems
which
result
from
the
complex
conditions
of
modern
civilization
would
it
not
be
very
hard
to
expect
anyone
to
solve
a
problem
in
conic
sections
who
had
merely
been
taught
the
axioms
and
definitions
of
mathematical
science
a
workman
has
to
bear
hard
labour
and
perhaps
privation
while
he
sees
others
rolling
in
wealth
and
feeding
their
dogs
with
what
would
keep
his
children
from
starvation
would
it
not
be
well
to
have
helped
that
man
to
calm
the
natural
promptings
of
discontent
by
showing
him
in
his
youth
the
necessary
connexion
of
the
moral
law
which
prohibits
stealing
with
the
stability
of
society
by
proving
to
him
once
for
all
that
it
is
better
for
his
own
people
better
for
himself
better
for
future
generations
that
he
should
starve
than
steal
if
you
have
no
foundation
of
knowledge
or
habit
of
thought
to
work
upon
what
chance
have
you
of
persuading
a
hungry
man
that
a
capitalist
is
not
a
thief
with
a
circumbendibus
and
if
he
honestly
believes
that
of
what
avail
is
it
to
quote
the
commandment
against
stealing
when
he
proposes
to
make
the
capitalist
disgorge
again
the
child
learns
absolutely
nothing
of
the
history
or
the
political
organization
of
his
own
country
his
general
impression
is
that
everything
of
much
importance
happened
a
very
long
while
ago
and
that
the
queen
and
the
gentlefolks
govern
the
country
much
after
the
fashion
of
king
david
and
the
elders
and
nobles
of
israel
his
sole
models
will
you
give
a
man
with
this
much
information
a
vote
in
easy
times
he
sells
it
for
a
pot
of
beer
why
should
he
not
it
is
of
about
as
much
use
to
him
as
a
chignon
and
he
knows
as
much
what
to
do
with
it
for
any
other
purpose
in
bad
times
on
the
contrary
he
applies
his
simple
theory
of
government
and
believes
that
his
rulers
are
the
cause
of
his
sufferings
a
belief
which
sometimes
bears
remarkable
practical
fruits
least
of
all
does
the
child
gather
from
this
primary
education
of
ours
a
conception
of
the
laws
of
the
physical
world
or
of
the
relations
of
cause
and
effect
therein
and
this
is
the
more
to
be
lamented
as
the
poor
are
especially
exposed
to
physical
evils
and
are
more
interested
in
removing
them
than
any
other
class
of
the
community
if
any
one
is
concerned
in
knowing
the
ordinary
laws
of
mechanics
one
would
think
it
is
the
whose
daily
toil
lies
among
levers
and
pulleys
or
among
the
other
implements
of
artisan
work
and
if
any
one
is
interested
in
the
laws
of
health
it
is
the
poor
workman
whose
strength
is
wasted
by
food
whose
health
is
sapped
by
bad
ventilation
and
bad
drainage
and
half
whose
children
are
massacred
by
disorders
which
might
be
prevented
not
only
does
our
present
primary
education
carefully
abstain
from
hinting
to
the
workman
that
some
of
his
greatest
evils
are
traceable
to
mere
physical
agencies
which
could
be
removed
by
energy
patience
and
frugality
but
it
does
worse
it
renders
him
so
far
as
it
can
deaf
to
those
who
could
help
him
and
tries
to
substitute
an
oriental
submission
to
what
is
falsely
declared
to
be
the
will
of
god
for
his
natural
tendency
to
strive
after
a
better
condition
what
wonder
then
if
very
recently
an
appeal
has
been
made
to
statistics
for
the
profoundly
foolish
purpose
of
showing
that
education
is
of
no
good
that
it
diminishes
neither
misery
nor
crime
among
the
masses
of
mankind
i
reply
why
should
the
thing
which
has
been
called
education
do
either
the
one
or
the
other
if
i
am
a
knave
or
a
fool
teaching
me
to
read
and
write
wo
make
me
less
of
either
one
or
the
other
unless
somebody
shows
me
how
to
put
my
reading
and
writing
to
wise
and
good
purposes
suppose
any
one
were
to
argue
that
medicine
is
of
no
use
because
it
could
be
proved
statistically
that
the
percentage
of
deaths
was
just
the
same
among
people
who
had
been
taught
how
to
open
a
medicine
chest
and
among
those
who
did
not
so
much
as
know
the
key
by
sight
the
argument
is
absurd
but
it
is
not
more
preposterous
than
that
against
which
i
am
contending
the
only
medicine
for
suffering
crime
and
all
the
other
woes
of
mankind
is
wisdom
teach
a
man
to
read
and
write
and
you
have
put
into
his
hands
the
great
keys
of
the
wisdom
box
but
it
is
quite
another
matter
whether
he
ever
opens
the
box
or
not
and
he
is
as
likely
to
poison
as
to
cure
himself
if
without
guidance
he
swallows
the
first
drug
that
comes
to
hand
in
these
times
a
man
may
as
well
be
purblind
as
unable
to
read
lame
as
unable
to
write
but
i
protest
that
if
i
thought
the
alternative
were
a
necessary
one
i
would
rather
that
the
children
of
the
poor
should
grow
up
ignorant
of
both
these
mighty
arts
than
that
they
should
remain
ignorant
of
that
knowledge
to
which
these
arts
are
means
it
may
be
said
that
all
these
animadversions
may
apply
to
primary
schools
but
that
the
higher
schools
at
any
rate
must
be
allowed
to
give
a
liberal
education
in
fact
they
professedly
sacrifice
everything
else
to
this
object
let
us
inquire
into
this
matter
what
do
the
higher
schools
those
to
which
the
great
middle
class
of
the
country
sends
it
children
teach
over
and
above
the
instruction
given
in
the
primary
schools
there
is
a
little
more
reading
and
writing
of
english
but
for
all
that
every
one
knows
that
it
is
a
rare
thing
to
find
a
boy
of
the
middle
or
upper
classes
who
can
read
aloud
decently
or
who
can
put
his
thoughts
on
paper
in
clear
and
grammatical
to
say
nothing
of
good
or
elegant
language
the
ciphering
of
the
lower
schools
expands
into
elementary
mathematics
in
the
higher
into
arithmetic
with
a
little
algebra
a
little
euclid
but
i
doubt
if
one
boy
in
five
hundred
has
ever
heard
the
explanation
of
a
rule
of
arithmetic
or
knows
his
euclid
otherwise
than
by
rote
of
theology
the
middle
class
schoolboy
gets
rather
less
than
poorer
children
less
absolutely
and
less
relatively
because
there
are
so
many
other
claims
upon
his
attention
i
venture
to
say
that
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
his
ideas
on
this
subject
when
he
leaves
school
are
of
the
most
shadowy
and
vague
description
and
associated
with
painful
impressions
of
the
weary
hours
spent
in
learning
collects
and
catechism
by
heart
modern
geography
modern
history
modern
literature
the
english
language
as
a
language
the
whole
circle
of
the
sciences
physical
moral
and
social
are
even
more
completely
ignored
in
the
higher
than
in
the
lower
schools
up
till
within
a
few
years
back
a
boy
might
have
passed
through
any
one
of
the
great
public
schools
with
the
greatest
distinction
and
credit
and
might
never
so
much
as
have
heard
of
one
of
the
subjects
i
have
just
mentioned
he
might
never
have
heard
that
the
earth
goes
round
the
sun
that
england
underwent
a
great
revolution
in
and
france
another
in
that
there
once
lived
certain
notable
men
called
chaucer
shakspeare
milton
voltaire
goethe
schiller
the
first
might
be
a
german
and
the
last
an
englishman
for
anything
he
could
tell
you
to
the
contrary
and
as
for
science
the
only
idea
the
word
would
suggest
to
his
mind
would
be
dexterity
in
boxing
i
have
said
that
this
was
the
state
of
things
a
few
years
back
for
the
sake
of
the
few
righteous
who
are
to
be
found
among
the
educational
cities
of
the
plain
but
i
would
not
have
you
too
sanguine
about
the
result
if
you
sound
the
minds
of
the
existing
generation
of
public
on
such
topics
as
those
i
have
mentioned
now
let
us
pause
to
consider
this
wonderful
state
of
affairs
for
the
time
will
come
when
englishmen
will
quote
it
as
the
stock
example
of
the
stolid
stupidity
of
their
ancestors
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
most
thoroughly
commercial
people
the
greatest
voluntary
wanderers
and
colonists
the
world
has
ever
seen
are
precisely
the
middle
classes
of
this
country
if
there
be
a
people
which
has
been
busy
making
history
on
the
great
scale
for
the
last
three
hundred
years
and
the
most
profoundly
interesting
history
history
which
if
it
happened
to
be
that
of
greece
or
rome
we
should
study
with
avidity
it
is
the
english
if
there
be
a
people
which
during
the
same
period
has
developed
a
remarkable
literature
it
is
our
own
if
there
be
a
nation
whose
prosperity
depends
absolutely
and
wholly
upon
their
mastery
over
the
forces
of
nature
upon
their
intelligent
apprehension
of
and
obedience
to
the
laws
of
the
creation
and
distribution
of
wealth
and
of
the
stable

of

forces
of

it
is
precisely
this
nation
and
yet
this
is
what
these
wonderful
people
tell
their
sons
at
the
cost
of
from
one
to
two
thousand
pounds
of
our
hard
earned
money
we
devote
twelve
of
the
most
precious
years
of
your
lives
to
school
there
you
shall
toil
or
be
supposed
to
toil
but
there
you
shall
not
learn
one
single
thing
of
all
those
you
will
most
want
to
know
directly
you
leave
school
and
enter
upon
the
practical
business
of
life
you
will
in
all
probability
go
into
business
but
you
shall
not
know
where
or
how
any
article
of
commerce
is
produced
or
the
difference
between
an
export
or
an
import
or
the
meaning
of
the
word
you
will
very
likely
settle
in
a
colony
but
you
shall
not
know
whether
tasmania
is
part
of
new
south
wales
or
very
probably
you
may
become
a
manufacturer
but
you
shall
not
be
provided
with
the
means
of
understanding
the
working
of
one
of
your
own
or
the
nature
of
the
raw
products
you
employ
and
when
you
are
asked
to
buy
a
patent
you
shall
not
have
the
slightest
means
of
judging
whether
the
inventor
is
an
impostor
who
is
contravening
the
elementary
principles
of
science
or
a
man
who
will
make
you
as
rich
as
croesus
you
will
very
likely
get
into
the
house
of
commons
you
will
have
to
take
your
share
in
making
laws
which
may
prove
a
blessing
or
a
curse
to
millions
of
men
but
you
shall
not
hear
one
word
respecting
the
political
organization
of
your
country
the
meaning
of
the
controversy
between
freetraders
and
protectionists
shall
never
have
been
mentioned
to
you
you
shall
not
so
much
as
know
that
there
are
such
things
as
economical
laws
the
mental
power
which
will
be
of
most
importance
in
your
daily
life
will
be
the
power
of
seeing
things
as
they
are
without
regard
to
authority
and
of
drawing
accurate
general
conclusions
from
particular
facts
but
at
school
and
at
college
you
shall
know
of
no
source
of
truth
but
authority
nor
exercise
your
reasoning
faculty
upon
anything
but
deduction
from
that
which
is
laid
down
by
authority
you
will
have
to
weary
your
soul
with
work
and
many
a
time
eat
your
bread
in
sorrow
and
in
bitterness
and
you
shall
not
have
learned
to
take
refuge
in
the
great
source
of
pleasure
without
alloy
the
serene
for
worn
human
nature
the
world
of
art
said
i
not
rightly
that
we
are
a
wonderful
people
i
am
quite
prepared
to
allow
that
education
entirely
devoted
to
these
omitted
subjects
might
not
be
a
completely
liberal
education
but
is
an
education
which
ignores
them
all
a
liberal
education
nay
is
it
too
much
to
say
that
the
education
which
should
embrace
these
subjects
and
no
others
would
be
a
real
education
though
an
incomplete
one
while
an
education
which
omits
them
is
really
not
an
education
at
all
but
a
more
or
less
useful
course
of
intellectual
gymnastics
for
what
does
the
school
put
in
the
place
of
all
these
things
which
are
left
out
it
substitutes
what
is
usually
comprised
under
the
compendious
title
of
the
classics
that
is
to
say
the
languages
the
literature
and
the
history
of
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
and
the
geography
of
so
much
of
the
world
as
was
known
to
these
two
great
nations
of
antiquity
now
do
not
expect
me
to
depreciate
the
earnest
and
enlightened
pursuit
of
classical
learning
i
have
not
the
least
desire
to
speak
ill
of
such
occupations
nor
any
sympathy
with
those
who
run
them
down
on
the
contrary
if
my
opportunities
had
lain
in
that
direction
there
is
no
investigation
into
which
i
could
have
thrown
myself
with
greater
delight
than
that
of
antiquity
what
science
can
present
greater
attractions
than
philology
how
can
a
lover
of
literary
excellence
fail
to
rejoice
in
the
ancient
masterpieces
and
with
what
consistency
could
i
whose
business
lies
so
much
in
the
attempt
to
decipher
the
past
and
to
build
up
intelligible
forms
out
of
the
scattered
fragments
of
beings
fail
to
take
a
sympathetic
though
an
unlearned
interest
in
the
labours
of
a
niebuhr
a
gibbon
or
a
grote
classical
history
is
a
great
section
of
the
pal√¶ontology
of
man
and
i
have
the
same
double
respect
for
it
as
for
other
kinds
of
pal√¶ontology
that
is
to
say
a
respect
for
the
facts
which
it
establishes
as
for
all
facts
and
a
still
greater
respect
for
it
as
a
preparation
for
the
discovery
of
a
law
of
progress
but
if
the
classics
were
taught
as
they
might
be
taught
if
boys
and
girls
were
instructed
in
greek
and
latin
not
merely
as
languages
but
as
illustrations
of
philological
science
if
a
vivid
picture
of
life
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
two
thousand
years
ago
were
imprinted
on
the
minds
of
scholars
if
ancient
history
were
taught
not
as
a
weary
series
of
feuds
and
fights
but
traced
to
its
causes
in
such
men
placed
under
such
conditions
if
lastly
the
study
of
the
classical
books
were
followed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
impress
boys
with
their
beauties
and
with
the
grand
simplicity
of
their
statement
of
the
everlasting
problems
of
human
life
instead
of
with
their
verbal
and
grammatical
peculiarities
i
still
think
it
as
little
proper
that
they
should
form
the
basis
of
a
liberal
education
for
our
contemporaries
as
i
should
think
it
fitting
to
make
that
sort
of
pal√¶ontology
with
which
i
am
familiar
the
of
modern
education
it
is
wonderful
how
close
a
parallel
to
classical
training
could
be
made
out
of
that
pal√¶ontology
to
which
i
refer
in
the
first
place
i
could
get
up
an
osteological
primer
so
arid
so
pedantic
in
its
terminology
so
altogether
distasteful
to
the
youthful
mind
as
to
beat
the
recent
famous
production
of
the
out
of
the
field
in
all
these
excellences
next
i
could
exercise
my
boys
upon
easy
fossils
and
bring
out
all
their
powers
of
memory
and
all
their
ingenuity
in
the
application
of
my
rules
to
the
interpretation
or
construing
of
those
fragments
to
those
who
had
reached
the
higher
classes
i
might
supply
odd
bones
to
be
built
up
into
animals
giving
great
honour
and
reward
to
him
who
succeeded
in
fabricating
monsters
most
entirely
in
accordance
with
the
rules
that
would
answer
to
and
in
the
dead
languages
to
be
sure
if
a
great
comparative
anatomist
were
to
look
at
these
fabrications
he
might
shake
his
head
or
laugh
but
what
then
would
such
a
catastrophe
destroy
the
parallel
what
think
you
would
cicero
or
horace
say
to
the
production
of
the
best
sixth
form
going
and
would
not
terence
stop
his
ears
and
run
out
if
he
could
be
present
at
an
english
performance
of
his
own
plays
would
hamlet
in
the
mouths
of
a
set
of
french
actors
who
should
insist
on
pronouncing
english
after
the
fashion
of
their
own
tongue
be
more
hideously
ridiculous
but
it
will
be
said
that
i
am
forgetting
the
beauty
and
the
human
interest
which
appertain
to
classical
studies
to
this
i
reply
that
it
is
only
a
very
strong
man
who
can
appreciate
the
charms
of
a
landscape
as
he
is
toiling
up
a
steep
hill
along
a
bad
road
what
with
stones
ruts
and
a
pervading
sense
of
the
wisdom
of
rest
and
be
thankful
most
of
us
have
little
enough
sense
of
the
beautiful
under
these
circumstances
the
ordinary
is
precisely
in
this
case
he
finds
parnassus
uncommonly
steep
and
there
is
no
chance
of
his
having
much
time
or
inclination
to
look
about
him
till
he
gets
to
the
top
and
nine
times
out
of
ten
he
does
not
get
to
the
top
but
if
this
be
a
fair
picture
of
the
results
of
classical
teaching
at
its
best
and
i
gather
from
those
who
have
authority
to
speak
on
such
matters
that
it
is
so
what
is
to
be
said
of
classical
teaching
at
its
worst
or
in
other
words
of
the
classics
of
our
ordinary
schools
i
will
tell
you
it
means
getting
up
endless
forms
and
rules
by
heart
it
means
turning
latin
and
greek
into
english
for
the
mere
sake
of
being
able
to
do
it
and
without
the
smallest
regard
to
the
worth
or
worthlessness
of
the
author
read
it
means
the
learning
of
innumerable
not
always
decent
fables
in
such
a
shape
that
the
meaning
they
once
had
is
dried
up
into
utter
trash
and
the
only
impression
left
upon
a
boy
mind
is
that
the
people
who
believed
such
things
must
have
been
the
greatest
idiots
the
world
ever
saw
and
it
means
finally
that
after
a
dozen
years
spent
at
this
kind
of
work
the
sufferer
shall
be
incompetent
to
interpret
a
passage
in
an
author
he
has
not
already
got
up
that
he
shall
loathe
the
sight
of
a
greek
or
latin
book
and
that
he
shall
never
open
or
think
of
a
classical
writer
again
until
wonderful
to
relate
he
insists
upon
submitting
his
sons
to
the
same
process
these
be
your
gods
o
israel
for
the
sake
of
this
net
result
and
respectability
the
british
father
denies
his
children
all
the
knowledge
they
might
turn
to
account
in
life
not
merely
for
the
achievement
of
vulgar
success
but
for
guidance
in
the
great
crises
of
human
existence
this
is
the
stone
he
offers
to
those
whom
he
is
bound
by
the
strongest
and
tenderest
ties
to
feed
with
bread
if
primary
and
secondary
education
are
in
this
unsatisfactory
state
what
is
to
be
said
to
the
universities
this
is
an
awful
subject
and
one
i
almost
fear
to
touch
with
my
unhallowed
hands
but
i
can
tell
you
what
those
say
who
have
authority
to
speak
the
rector
of
lincoln
college
in
his
lately
published
valuable
suggestions
for
academical
organization
with
especial
reference
to
oxford
tells
us
the
colleges
were
in
their
origin
endowments
not
for
the
elements
of
a
general
liberal
education
but
for
the
prolonged
study
of
special
and
professional
faculties
by
men
of
riper
age
the
universities
embraced
both
these
objects
the
colleges
while
they
incidentally
aided
in
elementary
education
were
specially
devoted
to
the
highest
learning
this
was
the
theory
of
the
university
and
the
design
of
collegiate
foundations
in
their
origin
time
and
circumstances
have
brought
about
a
total
change
the
colleges
no
longer
promote
the
researches
of
science
or
direct
professional
study
here
and
there
college
walls
may
shelter
an
occasional
student
but
not
in
larger
proportions
than
may
be
found
in
private
life
elementary
teaching
of
youths
under
twenty
is
now
the
only
function
performed
by
the
university
and
almost
the
only
object
of
college
endowments
colleges
were
homes
for
the
of
the
highest
and
most
abstruse
parts
of
knowledge
they
have
become
boarding
schools
in
which
the
elements
of
the
learned
languages
are
taught
to
youths
if
pattison
high
position
and
his
obvious
love
and
respect
for
his
university
be
insufficient
to
convince
the
outside
world
that
language
so
severe
is
yet
no
more
than
just
the
authority
of
the
commissioners
who
reported
on
the
university
of
oxford
in
is
open
to
no
challenge
yet
they
write
it
is
generally
acknowledged
that
both
oxford
and
the
country
at
large
suffer
greatly
from
the
absence
of
a
body
of
learned
men
devoting
their
lives
to
the
cultivation
of
science
and
to
the
direction
of
academical
education
the
fact
that
so
few
books
of
profound
research
emanate
from
the
university
of
oxford
materially
impairs
its
character
as
a
seat
of
learning
and
consequently
its
hold
on
the
respect
of
the
nation
cambridge
can
claim
no
exemption
from
the
reproaches
addressed
to
oxford
and
thus
there
seems
no
escape
from
the
admission
that
what
we
fondly
call
our
great
seats
of
learning
are
simply
boarding
schools
for
bigger
boys
that
learned
men
are
not
more
numerous
in
them
than
out
of
them
that
the
advancement
of
knowledge
is
not
the
object
of
fellows
of
colleges
that
in
the
philosophic
calm
and
meditative
stillness
of
their
greenswarded
courts
philosophy
does
not
thrive
and
meditation
bears
few
fruits
it
is
my
great
good
fortune
to
reckon
amongst
my
friends
resident
members
of
both
universities
who
are
men
of
learning
and
research
zealous
cultivators
of
science
keeping
before
their
minds
a
noble
ideal
of
a
university
and
doing
their
best
to
make
that
ideal
a
reality
and
to
me
they
would
necessarily
typify
the
universities
did
not
the
authoritative
statements
i
have
quoted
compel
me
to
believe
that
they
are
exceptional
and
not
representative
men
indeed
upon
calm
consideration
several
circumstances
lead
me
to
think
that
the
rector
of
lincoln
college
and
the
commissioners
can
not
be
far
wrong
i
believe
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
foreigner
who
should
wish
to
become
acquainted
with
the
scientific
or
the
literary
activity
of
modern
england
would
simply
lose
his
time
and
his
pains
if
he
visited
our
universities
with
that
object
and
as
for
works
of
profound
research
on
any
subject
and
above
all
in
that
classical
lore
for
which
the
universities
profess
to
sacrifice
almost
everything
else
why
a
german
university
turns
out
more
produce
of
that
kind
in
one
year
than
our
vast
and
wealthy
foundations
elaborate
in
ten
ask
the
man
who
is
investigating
any
question
profoundly
and
thoroughly
be
it
historical
philosophical
philological
physical
literary
or
theological
who
is
trying
to
make
himself
master
of
any
abstract
subject
except
perhaps
political
economy
and
geology
both
of
which
are
intensely
anglican
sciences
whether
he
is
not
compelled
to
read
half
a
dozen
times
as
many
german
as
english
books
and
whether
of
these
english
books
more
than
one
in
ten
is
the
work
of
a
fellow
of
a
college
or
a
professor
of
an
english
university
is
this
from
any
lack
of
power
in
the
english
as
compared
with
the
german
mind
the
countrymen
of
grote
and
of
mill
of
faraday
of
robert
brown
of
lyell
and
of
darwin
to
go
no
further
back
than
the
contemporaries
of
men
of
middle
age
can
afford
to
smile
at
such
a
suggestion
england
can
show
now
as
she
has
been
able
to
show
in
every
generation
since
civilization
spread
over
the
west
individual
men
who
hold
their
own
against
the
world
and
keep
alive
the
old
tradition
of
her
intellectual
eminence
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
these
men
are
what
they
are
in
virtue
of
their
native
intellectual
force
and
of
a
strength
of
character
which
will
not
recognise
impediments
they
are
not
trained
in
the
courts
of
the
temple
of
science
but
storm
the
walls
of
that
edifice
in
all
sorts
of
irregular
ways
and
with
much
loss
of
time
and
power
in
order
to
obtain
their
legitimate
positions
our
universities
not
only
do
not
encourage
such
men
do
not
offer
them
positions
in
which
it
should
be
their
highest
duty
to
do
thoroughly
that
which
they
are
most
capable
of
doing
but
as
far
as
possible
university
training
shuts
out
of
the
minds
of
those
among
them
who
are
subjected
to
it
the
prospect
that
there
is
anything
in
the
world
for
which
they
are
specially
fitted
imagine
the
success
of
the
attempt
to
still
the
intellectual
hunger
any
of
the
men
i
have
mentioned
by
putting
before
him
as
the
object
of
existence
the
successful
mimicry
of
the
measure
of
a
greek
song
or
the
roll
of
ciceronian
prose
imagine
how
much
success
would
be
likely
to
attend
the
attempt
to
persuade
such
men
that
the
education
which
leads
to
perfection
in
such
elegancies
is
alone
to
be
called
culture
while
the
facts
of
history
the
process
of
thought
the
conditions
of
moral
and
social
existence
and
the
laws
of
physical
nature
are
left
to
be
dealt
with
as
they
may
by
outside
barbarians
it
is
not
thus
that
the
german
universities
from
being
beneath
notice
a
century
ago
have
become
what
they
are
now
the
most
intensely
cultivated
and
the
most
productive
intellectual
corporations
the
world
has
ever
seen
the
student
who
repairs
to
them
sees
in
the
list
of
classes
and
of
professors
a
fair
picture
of
the
world
of
knowledge
whatever
he
needs
to
know
there
is
some
one
ready
to
teach
him
some
one
competent
to
discipline
him
in
the
way
of
learning
whatever
his
special
bent
let
him
but
be
able
and
diligent
and
in
due
time
he
shall
find
distinction
and
a
career
among
his
professors
he
sees
men
whose
names
are
known
and
revered
throughout
the
civilized
world
and
their
living
example
infects
him
with
a
noble
ambition
and
a
love
for
the
spirit
of
work
the
germans
dominate
the
intellectual
world
by
virtue
of
the
same
simple
secret
as
that
which
made
napoleon
the
master
of
old
europe
they
have
declared
carri√®re
ouverte
aux
and
every
bursch
marches
with
a
professor
gown
in
his
knapsack
let
him
become
a
great
scholar
or
man
of
science
and
ministers
will
compete
for
his
services
in
germany
they
do
not
leave
the
chance
of
his
holding
the
office
he
would
render
illustrious
to
the
tender
mercies
of
a
hot
canvass
and
the
final
wisdom
of
a
mob
of
country
parsons
in
short
in
germany
the
universities
are
exactly
what
the
rector
of
lincoln
and
the
commissioners
tell
us
the
english
universities
are
not
that
is
to
say
corporations
of
learned
men
devoting
their
lives
to
the
cultivation
of
science
and
the
direction
of
academical
education
they
are
not
boarding
schools
for
youths
nor
clerical
seminaries
but
institutions
for
the
higher
culture
of
men
in
which
the
theological
faculty
is
of
no
more
importance
or
prominence
than
the
rest
and
which
are
truly
universities
since
they
strive
to
represent
and
embody
the
totality
of
human
knowledge
and
to
find
room
for
all
forms
of
intellectual
activity
may
zealous
and
reformers
like
pattison
succeed
in
their
noble
endeavours
to
shape
our
universities
towards
some
such
ideal
as
this
without
losing
what
is
valuable
and
distinctive
in
their
social
tone
but
until
they
have
succeeded
a
liberal
education
will
be
no
more
obtainable
in
our
oxford
and
cambridge
universities
than
in
our
public
schools
if
i
am
justified
in
my
conception
of
the
ideal
of
a
liberal
education
and
if
what
i
have
said
about
the
existing
educational
institutions
of
the
country
is
also
true
it
is
clear
that
the
two
have
no
sort
of
relation
to
one
another
that
the
best
of
our
schools
and
the
most
complete
of
our
university
trainings
give
but
a
narrow
and
essentially
illiberal
education
while
the
worst
give
what
is
really
next
to
no
education
at
all
the
south
london
college
could
not
copy
any
of
these
institutions
if
it
would
i
am
bold
enough
to
express
the
conviction
that
it
ought
not
if
it
could
for
what
is
wanted
is
the
reality
and
not
the
mere
name
of
a
liberal
education
and
this
college
must
steadily
set
before
itself
the
ambition
to
be
able
to
give
that
education
sooner
or
later
at
present
we
are
but
beginning
sharpening
our
educational
tools
as
it
were
and
except
a
modicum
of
physical
science
we
are
not
able
to
offer
much
more
than
is
to
be
found
in
an
ordinary
school
moral
and
social
science
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
fruitful
of
our
future
classes
i
hope
at
present
lacks
only
one
thing
in
our
programme
and
that
is
a
teacher
a
considerable
want
no
doubt
but
it
must
be
recollected
that
it
is
much
better
to
want
a
teacher
than
to
want
the
desire
to
learn
further
we
need
what
for
want
of
a
better
name
i
must
call
physical
geography
what
i
mean
is
that
which
the
germans
call
it
is
a
description
of
the
earth
of
its
place
and
relation
to
other
bodies
of
its
general
structure
and
of
its
great
features
winds
tides
mountains
plains
of
the
chief
forms
of
the
vegetable
and
animal
worlds
of
the
varieties
of
man
it
is
the
peg
upon
which
the
greatest
quantity
of
useful
and
entertaining
scientific
information
can
be
suspended
literature
is
not
upon
the
college
programme
but
i
hope
some
day
to
see
it
there
for
literature
is
the
greatest
of
all
sources
of
refined
pleasure
and
one
of
the
great
uses
of
a
liberal
education
is
to
enable
us
to
enjoy
that
pleasure
there
is
scope
enough
for
the
purposes
of
liberal
education
in
the
study
of
the
rich
treasures
of
our
own
language
alone
all
that
is
needed
is
direction
and
the
cultivation
of
a
refined
taste
by
attention
to
sound
criticism
but
there
is
no
reason
why
french
and
german
should
not
be
mastered
sufficiently
to
read
what
is
worth
reading
in
those
languages
with
pleasure
and
with
profit
and
finally
we
must
have
history
treated
not
as
a
succession
of
battles
and
dynasties
not
as
a
series
of
biographies
not
as
evidence
that
providence
has
always
been
on
the
side
of
either
whigs
or
tories
but
as
the
development
of
man
in
times
past
and
in
other
conditions
than
our
own
but
as
it
is
one
of
the
principles
of
our
college
to
be
the
public
must
lead
and
we
must
follow
in
these
matters
if
my
hearers
take
to
heart
what
i
have
said
about
liberal
education
they
will
desire
these
things
and
i
doubt
not
we
shall
be
able
to
supply
them
but
we
must
wait
till
the
demand
is
made
footnote
for
a
justification
of
what
is
here
said
about
these
schools
see
that
valuable
book
essays
on
a
liberal
education
iv
scientific
education
notes
of
an
speech
thackeray
talking
of
speeches
has
lamented
that
one
never
can
recollect
the
fine
things
one
thought
of
in
the
cab
in
going
to
the
place
of
entertainment
i
am
not
aware
that
there
are
any
fine
things
in
the
following
pages
but
such
as
there
are
stand
to
a
speech
which
really
did
get
itself
spoken
at
the
hospitable
table
of
the
liverpool
philomathic
society
more
or
less
in
the
position
of
what
one
thought
of
in
the
cab
the
introduction
of
scientific
training
into
the
general
education
of
the
country
is
a
topic
upon
which
i
could
not
have
spoken
without
some
more
or
less
apologetic
introduction
a
few
years
ago
but
upon
this
as
upon
other
matters
public
opinion
has
of
late
undergone
a
rapid
modification
committees
of
both
houses
of
the
legislature
have
agreed
that
something
must
be
done
in
this
direction
and
have
even
thrown
out
timid
and
faltering
suggestions
as
to
what
should
be
done
while
at
the
opposite
pole
of
society
committees
of
have
expressed
their
conviction
that
scientific
training
is
the
one
thing
needful
for
their
advancement
whether
as
men
or
as
workmen
only
the
other
day
it
was
my
duty
to
take
part
in
the
reception
of
a
deputation
of
london
working
men
who
desired
to
learn
from
sir
roderick
murchison
the
director
of
the
royal
school
of
mines
whether
the
organization
of
the
institution
in
jermyn
street
could
be
made
available
for
the
supply
of
that
scientific
instruction
the
need
of
which
could
not
have
been
apprehended
or
stated
more
clearly
than
it
was
by
them
the
heads
of
colleges
in
our
great
universities
who
have
not
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
mobile
of
persons
have
in
several
cases
thought
it
well
that
out
of
the
great
number
of
honours
and
rewards
at
their
disposal
a
few
should
hereafter
be
given
to
the
cultivators
of
the
physical
sciences
nay
i
hear
that
some
colleges
have
even
gone
so
far
as
to
appoint
one
or
may
be
two
special
tutors
for
the
purpose
of
putting
the
facts
and
principles
of
physical
science
before
the
undergraduate
mind
and
i
say
it
with
gratitude
and
great
respect
for
those
eminent
persons
that
the
head
masters
of
our
public
schools
eton
harrow
winchester
have
addressed
themselves
to
the
problem
of
introducing
instruction
in
physical
science
among
the
studies
of
those
great
educational
bodies
with
much
honesty
of
purpose
and
enlightenment
of
understanding
and
i
live
in
hope
that
before
long
important
changes
in
this
direction
will
be
carried
into
effect
in
those
strongholds
of
ancient
prescription
in
fact
such
changes
have
already
been
made
and
physical
science
even
now
constitutes
a
recognised
element
of
the
school
curriculum
in
harrow
and
rugby
whilst
i
understand
that
ample
preparations
for
such
studies
are
being
made
at
eton
and
elsewhere
looking
at
these
facts
i
might
perhaps
spare
myself
the
trouble
of
giving
any
reasons
for
the
introduction
of
physical
science
into
elementary
education
yet
i
can
not
but
think
that
it
may
be
well
if
i
place
before
you
some
considerations
which
perhaps
have
hardly
received
full
attention
at
other
times
and
in
other
places
i
have
endeavoured
to
state
the
higher
and
more
abstract
arguments
by
which
the
study
of
physical
science
may
be
shown
to
be
indispensable
to
the
complete
training
of
the
human
mind
but
i
do
not
wish
it
to
be
supposed
that
because
i
happen
to
be
devoted
to
more
or
less
abstract
and
unpractical
pursuits
i
am
insensible
to
the
weight
which
ought
to
be
attached
to
that
which
has
been
said
to
be
the
english
conception
of
paradise
namely
getting
on
i
look
upon
it
that
getting
on
is
a
very
important
matter
indeed
i
do
not
mean
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
coarse
and
tangible
results
of
success
but
because
humanity
is
so
constituted
that
a
vast
number
of
us
would
never
be
impelled
to
those
stretches
of
exertion
which
make
us
wiser
and
more
capable
men
if
it
were
not
for
the
absolute
necessity
of
putting
on
our
faculties
all
the
strain
they
will
bear
for
the
purpose
of
getting
on
in
the
most
practical
sense
now
the
value
of
a
knowledge
of
physical
science
as
a
means
of
getting
on
is
indubitable
there
are
hardly
any
of
our
trades
except
the
merely
huckstering
ones
in
which
some
knowledge
of
science
may
not
be
directly
profitable
to
the
pursuer
of
that
occupation
as
industry
attains
higher
stages
of
its
development
as
its
processes
become
more
complicated
and
refined
and
competition
more
keen
the
sciences
are
dragged
in
one
by
one
to
take
their
share
in
the
fray
and
he
who
can
best
avail
himself
of
their
help
is
the
man
who
will
come
out
uppermost
in
that
struggle
for
existence
which
goes
on
as
fiercely
beneath
the
smooth
surface
of
modern
society
as
among
the
wild
inhabitants
of
the
woods
but
in
addition
to
the
bearing
of
science
on
ordinary
practical
life
let
me
direct
your
attention
to
its
immense
influence
on
several
of
the
professions
i
ask
any
one
who
has
adopted
the
calling
of
an
engineer
how
much
time
he
lost
when
he
left
school
because
he
had
to
devote
himself
to
pursuits
which
were
absolutely
novel
and
strange
and
of
which
he
had
not
obtained
the
remotest
conception
from
his
instructors
he
had
to
familiarize
himself
with
ideas
of
the
course
and
powers
of
nature
to
which
his
attention
had
never
been
directed
during
his
and
to
learn
for
the
first
time
that
a
world
of
facts
lies
outside
and
beyond
the
world
of
words
i
appeal
to
those
who
know
what
engineering
is
to
say
how
far
i
am
right
in
respect
to
that
profession
but
with
regard
to
another
of
no
less
importance
i
shall
venture
to
speak
of
my
own
knowledge
there
is
no
one
of
who
may
not
at
any
moment
be
thrown
bound
hand
and
foot
by
physical
incapacity
into
the
hands
of
a
medical
practitioner
the
chances
of
life
and
death
for
all
and
each
of
us
may
at
any
moment
depend
on
the
skill
with
which
that
practitioner
is
able
to
make
out
what
is
wrong
in
our
bodily
frames
and
on
his
ability
to
apply
the
proper
remedy
to
the
defect
the
necessities
of
modern
life
are
such
and
the
class
from
which
the
medical
profession
is
chiefly
recruited
is
so
situated
that
few
medical
men
can
hope
to
spend
more
than
three
or
four
or
it
may
be
five
years
in
the
pursuit
of
those
studies
which
are
immediately
germane
to
physic
how
is
that
all
too
brief
period
spent
at
present
i
speak
as
an
old
examiner
having
served
some
eleven
or
twelve
years
in
that
capacity
in
the
university
of
london
and
therefore
having
a
practical
acquaintance
with
the
subject
but
i
might
fortify
myself
by
the
authority
of
the
president
of
the
college
of
surgeons
quain
whom
i
heard
the
other
day
in
an
admirable
address
the
hunterian
oration
deal
fully
and
wisely
with
this
very
topic
a
young
man
commencing
the
study
of
medicine
is
at
once
required
to
endeavour
to
make
an
acquaintance
with
a
number
of
sciences
such
as
physics
as
chemistry
as
botany
as
physiology
which
are
absolutely
and
entirely
strange
to
him
however
excellent
his
education
at
school
may
have
been
not
only
is
he
devoid
of
all
apprehension
of
scientific
conceptions
not
only
does
he
fail
to
attach
any
meaning
to
the
words
matter
force
or
law
in
their
scientific
senses
but
worse
still
he
has
no
notion
of
what
it
is
to
come
into
contact
with
nature
or
to
lay
his
mind
alongside
of
a
physical
fact
and
try
to
conquer
it
in
the
way
our
great
naval
hero
told
his
captains
to
master
their
enemies
his
whole
mind
has
been
given
to
books
and
i
am
hardly
exaggerating
if
i
say
that
they
are
more
real
to
him
than
nature
he
imagines
that
all
knowledge
can
be
got
out
of
books
and
rests
upon
the
authority
of
some
master
or
other
nor
does
he
entertain
any
misgiving
that
the
method
of
learning
which
led
to
proficiency
in
the
rules
of
grammar
will
suffice
to
lead
him
to
a
mastery
of
the
laws
of
nature
the
youngster
thus
unprepared
for
serious
study
is
turned
loose
among
his
medical
studies
with
the
result
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
that
the
first
year
of
his
curriculum
is
spent
in
learning
how
to
learn
indeed
he
is
lucky
if
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
by
the
exertions
of
his
teachers
and
his
own
industry
he
has
acquired
even
that
art
of
arts
after
which
there
remain
not
more
than
three
or
perhaps
four
years
for
the
profitable
study
of
such
vast
sciences
as
anatomy
physiology
therapeutics
medicine
surgery
obstetrics
and
the
like
upon
his
knowledge
or
ignorance
of
which
it
depends
whether
the
practitioner
shall
diminish
or
increase
the
bills
of
mortality
now
what
is
it
but
the
preposterous
condition
of
ordinary
school
education
which
prevents
a
young
man
of
seventeen
destined
for
the
practice
of
medicine
from
being
fully
prepared
for
the
study
of
nature
and
from
coming
to
the
medical
school
equipped
with
that
preliminary
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
physics
of
chemistry
and
of
biology
upon
which
he
has
now
to
waste
one
of
the
precious
years
every
moment
of
which
ought
to
be
given
to
those
studies
which
bear
directly
upon
the
knowledge
of
his
profession
there
is
another
profession
to
the
members
of
which
i
think
a
certain
preliminary
knowledge
of
physical
science
might
be
quite
as
valuable
as
to
the
medical
man
the
practitioner
of
medicine
sets
before
himself
the
noble
object
of
taking
care
of
man
bodily
welfare
but
the
members
of
this
other
profession
undertake
to
minister
to
minds
diseased
and
so
far
as
may
be
to
diminish
sin
and
soften
sorrow
like
the
medical
profession
the
clerical
of
which
i
now
speak
rests
its
power
to
heal
upon
its
knowledge
of
the
order
of
the
universe
upon
certain
theories
of
man
relation
to
that
which
lies
outside
him
it
is
not
my
business
to
express
any
opinion
about
these
theories
i
merely
wish
to
point
out
that
like
all
other
theories
they
are
professedly
based
upon
matter
of
fact
thus
the
clerical
profession
has
to
deal
with
the
facts
of
nature
from
a
certain
point
of
view
and
hence
it
comes
into
contact
with
that
of
the
man
of
science
who
has
to
treat
the
same
facts
from
another
point
of
view
you
know
how
often
that
contact
is
to
be
described
as
collision
or
violent
friction
and
how
great
the
heat
how
little
the
light
which
commonly
results
from
it
in
the
interests
of
fair
play
to
say
nothing
of
those
of
mankind
i
ask
why
do
not
the
clergy
as
a
body
acquire
as
a
part
of
their
preliminary
education
some
such
tincture
of
physical
science
as
will
put
them
in
a
position
to
understand
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
accepting
their
theories
which
are
forced
upon
the
mind
of
every
thoughtful
and
intelligent
man
who
has
taken
the
trouble
to
instruct
himself
in
the
elements
of
natural
knowledge
some
time
ago
i
attended
a
large
meeting
of
the
clergy
for
the
purpose
of
delivering
an
address
which
i
had
been
invited
to
give
i
spoke
of
some
of
the
most
elementary
facts
in
physical
science
and
of
the
manner
in
which
they
directly
contradict
certain
of
the
ordinary
teachings
of
the
clergy
the
result
was
that
after
i
had
finished
one
section
of
the
assembled
ecclesiastics
attacked
me
with
all
the
intemperance
of
pious
zeal
for
stating
facts
and
conclusions
which
no
competent
judge
doubts
while
after
the
first
speakers
had
subsided
amidst
the
cheers
of
the
great
majority
of
their
colleagues
the
more
rational
minority
rose
to
tell
me
that
i
had
taken
wholly
superfluous
pains
that
they
already
knew
all
about
what
i
had
told
them
and
perfectly
agreed
with
me
a
friend
of
mine
who
was
present
put
the
not
unnatural
question
then
why
do
you
say
so
in
your
pulpits
to
which
inquiry
i
heard
no
reply
in
fact
the
clergy
are
at
present
divisible
into
three
sections
an
immense
body
who
are
ignorant
and
speak
out
a
small
proportion
who
know
and
are
silent
and
a
minute
minority
who
know
and
speak
according
to
their
knowledge
by
the
clergy
i
mean
especially
the
protestant
clergy
our
great
antagonist
i
speak
as
a
man
of
science
the
roman
catholic
church
the
one
great
spiritual
organization
which
is
able
to
resist
and
must
as
a
matter
of
life
and
death
resist
the
progress
of
science
and
modern
civilization
manages
her
affairs
much
better
it
was
my
fortune
some
time
ago
to
pay
a
visit
to
one
of
the
most
important
of
the
institutions
in
which
the
clergy
of
the
roman
catholic
church
in
these
islands
are
trained
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
difference
between
these
men
and
the
comfortable
champions
of
anglicanism
and
of
dissent
was
comparable
to
the
difference
between
our
gallant
volunteers
and
the
trained
veterans
of
napoleon
old
guard
the
catholic
priest
is
trained
to
know
his
business
and
do
it
effectually
the
professors
of
the
college
in
question
learned
zealous
and
determined
men
permitted
me
to
speak
frankly
with
them
we
talked
like
outposts
of
opposed
armies
during
a
truce
as
friendly
enemies
and
when
i
ventured
to
point
out
the
difficulties
their
students
would
have
to
encounter
from
scientific
thought
they
replied
our
church
has
lasted
many
ages
and
has
passed
safely
through
many
storms
the
present
is
but
a
new
gust
of
the
old
tempest
and
we
do
not
turn
out
our
young
men
less
fitted
to
weather
it
than
they
have
been
in
former
times
to
cope
with
the
difficulties
of
those
times
the
heresies
of
the
day
are
explained
to
them
by
their
professors
of
philosophy
and
science
and
they
are
taught
how
those
heresies
are
to
be
met
i
heartily
respect
an
organization
which
faces
its
enemies
in
this
way
and
i
wish
that
all
ecclesiastical
organizations
were
in
as
effective
a
condition
i
think
it
would
be
better
not
only
for
them
but
for
us
the
army
of
liberal
thought
is
at
present
in
very
loose
order
and
many
a
spirited
makes
use
of
his
freedom
mainly
to
vent
nonsense
we
should
be
the
better
for
a
vigorous
and
watchful
enemy
to
hammer
us
into
cohesion
and
discipline
and
i
for
one
lament
that
the
bench
of
bishops
can
not
show
a
man
of
the
calibre
of
butler
of
the
analogy
who
if
he
were
alive
would
make
short
work
of
much
of
the
current
infidelity
i
hope
you
will
consider
that
the
arguments
i
have
now
stated
even
if
there
were
no
better
ones
constitute
a
sufficient
apology
for
urging
the
introduction
of
science
into
schools
the
next
question
to
which
i
have
to
address
myself
is
what
sciences
ought
to
be
thus
taught
and
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
of
questions
because
my
side
i
am
afraid
i
am
a
terribly
candid
friend
sometimes
spoils
its
cause
by
going
in
for
too
much
there
are
other
forms
of
culture
beside
physical
science
and
i
should
be
profoundly
sorry
to
see
the
fact
forgotten
or
even
to
observe
a
tendency
to
starve
or
cripple
literary
or
√¶sthetic
culture
for
the
sake
of
science
such
a
narrow
view
of
the
nature
of
education
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
firm
conviction
that
a
complete
and
thorough
scientific
culture
ought
to
be
introduced
into
all
schools
by
this
however
i
do
not
mean
that
every
schoolboy
should
be
taught
everything
in
science
that
would
be
a
very
absurd
thing
to
conceive
and
a
very
mischievous
thing
to
attempt
what
i
mean
is
that
no
boy
nor
girl
should
leave
school
without
possessing
a
grasp
of
the
general
character
of
science
and
without
having
been
disciplined
more
or
less
in
the
methods
of
all
sciences
so
that
when
turned
into
the
world
to
make
their
own
way
they
shall
be
prepared
to
face
scientific
problems
not
by
knowing
at
once
the
conditions
of
every
problem
or
by
being
able
at
once
to
solve
it
but
by
being
familiar
with
the
general
current
of
scientific
thought
and
by
being
able
to
apply
the
methods
of
science
in
the
proper
way
when
they
have
acquainted
themselves
with
the
conditions
of
the
special
problem
that
is
what
i
understand
by
scientific
education
to
furnish
a
boy
with
such
an
education
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
that
he
should
devote
his
whole
school
existence
to
physical
science
in
fact
no
one
would
lament
so
a
proceeding
more
than
nay
more
it
is
not
necessary
for
him
to
give
up
more
than
a
moderate
share
of
his
time
to
such
studies
if
they
be
properly
selected
and
arranged
and
if
he
be
trained
in
them
in
a
fitting
manner
i
conceive
the
proper
course
to
be
somewhat
as
follows
to
begin
with
let
every
child
be
instructed
in
those
general
views
of
the
phenomena
of
nature
for
which
we
have
no
exact
english
name
the
nearest
approximation
to
a
name
for
what
i
mean
which
we
possess
is
physical
geography
the
germans
have
a
better
erdkunde
earth
knowledge
or
geology
in
its
etymological
sense
that
is
to
say
a
general
knowledge
of
the
earth
and
what
is
on
it
in
it
and
about
it
if
any
one
who
has
had
experience
of
the
ways
of
young
children
will
call
to
mind
their
questions
he
will
find
that
so
far
as
they
can
be
put
into
any
scientific
category
they
come
under
this
head
of
erdkunde
the
child
asks
what
is
the
moon
and
why
does
it
shine
what
is
this
water
and
where
does
it
run
what
is
the
wind
what
makes
the
waves
in
the
sea
where
does
this
animal
live
and
what
is
the
use
of
that
plant
and
if
not
snubbed
and
stunted
by
being
told
not
to
ask
foolish
questions
there
is
no
limit
to
the
intellectual
craving
of
a
young
child
nor
any
bounds
to
the
slow
but
solid
accretion
of
knowledge
and
development
of
the
thinking
faculty
in
this
way
to
all
such
questions
answers
which
are
necessarily
incomplete
though
true
as
far
as
they
go
may
be
given
by
any
teacher
whose
ideas
represent
real
knowledge
and
not
mere
book
learning
and
a
panoramic
view
of
nature
accompanied
by
a
strong
infusion
of
the
scientific
habit
of
mind
may
thus
be
placed
within
the
reach
of
every
child
of
nine
or
ten
after
this
preliminary
opening
of
the
eyes
to
the
great
spectacle
of
the
daily
progress
of
nature
as
the
reasoning
faculties
of
the
child
grow
and
he
becomes
familiar
with
the
use
of
the
tools
of
knowledge
reading
writing
and
elementary
mathematics
he
should
pass
on
to
what
is
in
the
more
strict
sense
physical
science
now
there
are
two
kinds
of
physical
science
the
one
regards
form
and
the
relation
of
forms
to
one
another
the
other
deals
with
causes
and
effects
in
many
of
what
we
term
our
sciences
these
two
kinds
are
mixed
up
together
but
systematic
botany
is
a
pure
example
of
the
former
kind
and
physics
of
the
latter
kind
of
science
every
educational
advantage
which
training
in
physical
science
can
give
is
obtainable
from
the
proper
study
of
these
two
and
i
should
be
contented
for
the
present
if
they
added
to
our
erdkunde
furnished
the
whole
of
the
scientific
curriculum
of
schools
indeed
i
conceive
it
would
be
one
of
the
greatest
boons
which
could
be
conferred
upon
england
if
henceforward
every
child
in
the
country
were
instructed
in
the
general
knowledge
of
the
things
about
it
in
the
elements
of
physics
and
of
botany
but
i
should
be
still
better
pleased
if
there
could
be
added
somewhat
of
chemistry
and
an
elementary
acquaintance
with
human
physiology
so
far
as
school
education
is
concerned
i
want
to
go
no
further
just
now
and
i
believe
that
such
instruction
would
make
an
excellent
introduction
to
that
preparatory
scientific
training
which
as
i
have
indicated
is
so
essential
for
the
successful
pursuit
of
our
most
important
professions
but
this
modicum
of
instruction
must
be
so
given
as
to
ensure
real
knowledge
and
practical
discipline
if
scientific
education
is
to
be
dealt
with
as
mere
bookwork
it
will
be
better
not
to
attempt
it
but
to
stick
to
the
latin
grammar
which
makes
no
pretence
to
be
anything
but
bookwork
if
the
great
benefits
of
scientific
training
are
sought
it
is
essential
that
such
training
should
be
real
that
is
to
say
that
the
mind
of
the
scholar
should
be
brought
into
direct
relation
with
fact
that
he
should
not
merely
be
told
a
thing
but
made
to
see
by
the
use
of
his
own
intellect
and
ability
that
the
thing
is
and
no
otherwise
the
great
peculiarity
of
scientific
training
that
in
virtue
of
which
it
can
not
be
replaced
by
any
other
discipline
whatsoever
is
this
bringing
of
the
mind
directly
into
contact
with
fact
and
practising
the
intellect
in
the
completest
form
of
induction
that
is
to
say
in
drawing
conclusions
from
particular
facts
made
known
by
immediate
observation
of
nature
the
other
studies
which
enter
into
ordinary
education
do
not
discipline
the
mind
in
this
way
mathematical
training
is
almost
purely
deductive
the
mathematician
starts
with
a
few
simple
propositions
the
proof
of
which
is
so
obvious
that
they
are
called
and
the
rest
of
his
work
consists
of
subtle
deductions
from
them
the
teaching
of
languages
at
any
rate
as
ordinarily
practised
is
of
the
same
general
nature
authority
and
tradition
furnish
the
data
and
the
mental
operations
of
the
scholar
are
deductive
again
if
history
be
the
subject
of
study
the
facts
are
still
taken
upon
the
evidence
of
tradition
and
authority
you
can
not
make
a
boy
see
the
battle
of
thermopyl√¶
for
himself
or
know
of
his
own
knowledge
that
cromwell
once
ruled
england
there
is
no
getting
into
direct
contact
with
natural
fact
by
this
road
there
is
no
dispensing
with
authority
but
rather
a
resting
upon
it
in
all
these
respects
science
differs
from
other
educational
discipline
and
prepares
the
scholar
for
common
life
what
have
we
to
do
in
life
most
of
the
business
which
demands
our
attention
is
matter
of
fact
which
needs
in
the
first
place
to
be
accurately
observed
or
apprehended
in
the
second
to
be
interpreted
by
inductive
and
deductive
reasonings
which
are
altogether
similar
in
their
nature
to
those
employed
in
science
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
whatever
is
taken
for
granted
is
so
taken
at
one
own
peril
fact
and
reason
are
the
ultimate
arbiters
and
patience
and
honesty
are
the
great
helpers
out
of
difficulty
but
if
scientific
training
is
to
yield
its
most
eminent
results
it
must
i
repeat
be
made
practical
that
is
to
say
in
explaining
to
a
child
the
general
phenomena
of
nature
you
must
as
far
as
possible
give
reality
to
your
teaching
by
in
teaching
him
botany
he
must
handle
the
plants
and
dissect
the
flowers
for
himself
in
teaching
him
physics
and
chemistry
you
must
not
be
solicitous
to
fill
him
with
information
but
you
must
be
careful
that
what
he
learns
he
knows
of
his
own
knowledge
do
be
satisfied
with
telling
him
that
a
magnet
attracts
iron
let
him
see
that
it
does
let
him
feel
the
pull
of
the
one
upon
the
other
for
himself
and
especially
tell
him
that
it
is
his
duty
to
doubt
until
he
is
compelled
by
the
absolute
authority
of
nature
to
believe
that
which
is
written
in
books
pursue
this
discipline
carefully
and
conscientiously
and
you
may
make
sure
that
however
scanty
may
be
the
measure
of
information
which
you
have
poured
into
the
boy
mind
you
have
created
an
intellectual
habit
of
priceless
value
in
practical
life
one
is
constantly
asked
when
should
this
scientific
education
be
commenced
i
should
say
with
the
dawn
of
intelligence
as
i
have
already
said
a
child
seeks
for
information
about
matters
of
physical
science
as
soon
as
it
begins
to
talk
the
first
teaching
it
wants
is
an
of
one
sort
or
another
and
as
soon
as
it
is
fit
for
systematic
instruction
of
any
kind
it
is
fit
for
a
modicum
of
science
people
talk
of
the
difficulty
of
teaching
young
children
such
matters
and
in
the
same
breath
insist
upon
their
learning
their
catechism
which
contains
propositions
far
harder
to
comprehend
than
anything
in
the
educational
course
i
have
proposed
again
i
am
incessantly
told
that
we
who
advocate
the
introduction
of
science
into
schools
make
no
allowance
for
the
stupidity
of
the
average
boy
or
girl
but
in
my
belief
that
stupidity
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
non
and
is
developed
by
a
long
process
of
parental
and
pedagogic
repression
of
the
natural
intellectual
appetites
accompanied
by
a
persistent
attempt
to
create
artificial
ones
for
food
which
is
not
only
tasteless
but
essentially
indigestible
those
who
urge
the
difficulty
of
instructing
young
people
in
science
are
apt
to
forget
another
very
important
condition
of
success
important
in
all
kinds
of
teaching
but
most
essential
i
am
disposed
to
think
when
the
scholars
are
very
young
this
condition
is
that
the
teacher
should
himself
really
and
practically
know
his
subject
if
he
does
he
will
be
able
to
speak
of
it
in
the
easy
language
and
with
the
completeness
of
conviction
with
which
he
talks
of
any
ordinary
matter
if
he
does
not
he
will
be
afraid
to
wander
beyond
the
limits
of
the
technical
phraseology
which
he
has
got
up
and
a
dead
dogmatism
which
oppresses
or
raises
opposition
will
take
the
place
of
the
lively
confidence
born
of
personal
conviction
which
cheers
and
encourages
the
eminently
sympathetic
mind
of
childhood
i
have
already
hinted
that
such
scientific
training
as
we
seek
for
may
be
given
without
making
any
extravagant
claim
upon
the
time
now
devoted
to
education
we
ask
only
for
a
most
favoured
nation
clause
in
our
treaty
with
the
schoolmaster
we
demand
no
more
than
that
science
shall
have
as
much
time
given
to
it
as
any
other
single
subject
say
four
hours
a
week
in
each
class
of
an
ordinary
school
for
the
present
i
think
men
of
science
would
be
well
content
with
such
an
arrangement
as
this
but
speaking
for
myself
i
do
not
pretend
to
believe
that
such
an
arrangement
can
be
or
will
be
permanent
in
these
times
the
educational
tree
seems
to
me
to
have
its
roots
in
the
air
its
leaves
and
flowers
in
the
ground
and
i
confess
i
should
very
much
like
to
turn
it
upside
down
so
that
its
roots
might
be
solidly
embedded
among
the
facts
of
nature
and
draw
thence
a
sound
nutriment
for
the
foliage
and
fruit
of
literature
and
of
art
no
educational
system
can
have
a
claim
to
permanence
unless
it
recognises
the
truth
that
education
has
two
great
ends
to
which
everything
else
must
be
subordinated
the
one
of
these
is
to
increase
knowledge
the
other
is
to
develop
the
love
of
right
and
the
hatred
of
wrong
with
wisdom
and
uprightness
a
nation
can
make
its
way
worthily
and
beauty
will
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
the
two
even
if
she
be
not
specially
invited
while
there
is
perhaps
no
sight
in
the
whole
world
more
saddening
and
revolting
than
is
offered
by
men
sunk
in
ignorance
of
everything
but
what
other
men
have
written
seemingly
devoid
of
moral
belief
or
guidance
but
with
the
sense
of
beauty
so
keen
and
the
power
of
expression
so
cultivated
that
their
sensual
caterwauling
may
be
almost
mistaken
for
the
music
of
the
spheres
at
present
education
is
almost
entirely
devoted
to
the
cultivation
of
the
power
of
expression
and
of
the
sense
of
literary
beauty
the
matter
of
having
anything
to
say
beyond
a
hash
of
other
people
opinions
or
of
possessing
any
criterion
of
beauty
so
that
we
may
distinguish
between
the
godlike
and
the
devilish
is
left
aside
as
of
no
moment
i
think
i
do
not
err
in
saying
that
if
science
were
made
the
foundation
of
education
instead
of
being
at
most
stuck
on
as
cornice
to
the
edifice
this
state
of
things
could
not
exist
in
advocating
the
introduction
of
physical
science
as
a
leading
element
in
education
i
by
no
means
refer
only
to
the
higher
schools
on
the
contrary
i
believe
that
such
a
change
is
even
more
imperatively
called
for
in
those
primary
schools
in
which
the
children
of
the
poor
are
expected
to
turn
to
the
best
account
the
little
time
they
can
devote
to
the
acquisition
of
knowledge
a
great
step
in
this
direction
has
already
been
made
by
the
establishment
of
under
the
department
of
science
and
art
a
measure
which
came
into
existence
unnoticed
but
which
will
i
believe
turn
out
to
be
of
more
importance
to
the
welfare
of
the
people
than
many
political
changes
over
which
the
noise
of
battle
has
rent
the
air
under
the
regulations
to
which
i
refer
a
schoolmaster
can
set
up
a
class
in
one
or
more
branches
of
science
his
pupils
will
be
examined
and
the
state
will
pay
him
at
a
certain
rate
for
all
who
succeed
in
passing
i
have
acted
as
an
examiner
under
this
system
from
the
beginning
of
its
establishment
and
this
year
i
expect
to
have
not
fewer
than
a
couple
of
thousand
sets
of
answers
to
questions
in
physiology
mainly
from
young
people
of
the
artisan
class
who
have
been
taught
in
the
schools
which
are
now
scattered
all
over
great
britain
and
ireland
some
of
my
colleagues
who
have
to
deal
with
subjects
such
as
geometry
for
which
the
present
teaching
power
is
better
organized
i
understand
are
likely
to
have
three
or
four
times
as
many
papers
so
far
as
my
own
subjects
are
concerned
i
can
undertake
to
say
that
a
great
deal
of
the
teaching
the
results
of
which
are
before
me
in
these
examinations
is
very
sound
and
good
and
i
think
it
is
in
the
power
of
the
examiners
not
only
to
keep
up
the
present
standard
but
to
cause
an
almost
unlimited
improvement
now
what
does
this
mean
it
means
that
by
holding
out
a
very
moderate
inducement
the
masters
of
primary
schools
in
many
parts
of
the
country
have
been
led
to
convert
them
into
little
foci
of
scientific
instruction
and
that
they
and
their
pupils
have
contrived
to
find
or
to
make
time
enough
to
carry
out
this
object
with
a
very
considerable
degree
of
efficiency
that
efficiency
will
i
doubt
not
be
very
much
increased
as
the
system
becomes
known
and
perfected
even
with
the
very
limited
leisure
left
to
masters
and
teachers
on
and
this
leads
me
to
ask
why
should
scientific
teaching
be
limited
to
persons
are
in
the
habit
of
calling
things
they
do
not
like
by
very
hard
names
and
i
should
not
wonder
if
they
brand
the
proposition
i
am
about
to
make
as
blasphemous
and
worse
but
not
minding
this
i
venture
to
ask
would
there
really
be
anything
wrong
in
using
part
of
sunday
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
those
who
have
no
other
leisure
in
a
knowledge
of
the
phenomena
of
nature
and
of
relation
to
nature
i
should
like
to
see
a
scientific
in
every
parish
not
for
the
purpose
of
superseding
any
existing
means
of
teaching
the
people
the
things
that
are
for
their
good
but
side
by
side
with
them
i
can
not
but
think
that
there
is
room
for
all
of
us
to
work
in
helping
to
bridge
over
the
great
abyss
of
ignorance
which
lies
at
our
feet
and
if
any
of
the
ecclesiastical
persons
to
whom
i
have
referred
object
that
they
find
it
derogatory
to
the
honour
of
the
god
whom
they
worship
to
awaken
the
minds
of
the
young
to
the
infinite
wonder
and
majesty
of
the
works
which
they
proclaim
his
and
to
teach
them
those
laws
which
must
needs
be
his
laws
and
therefore
of
all
things
needful
for
man
to
know
i
can
only
recommend
them
to
be
let
blood
and
put
on
low
diet
there
must
be
something
very
wrong
going
on
in
the
instrument
of
logic
if
it
turns
out
such
conclusions
from
such
premisses
footnote
quain
words
times
and
february
are
a
few
words
as
to
our
special
medical
course
of
instruction
and
the
influence
upon
it
of
such
changes
in
the
elementary
schools
as
i
have
mentioned
the
student
now
enters
at
once
upon
several
sciences
physics
chemistry
anatomy
physiology
botany
pharmacy
therapeutics
all
these
the
facts
and
the
language
and
the
laws
of
each
to
be
mastered
in
eighteen
months
up
to
the
beginning
of
the
medical
course
many
have
learned
little
we
can
not
claim
anything
better
than
the
examiner
of
the
university
of
london
and
the
cambridge
lecturer
have
reported
for
their
universities
supposing
that
at
school
young
people
had
acquired
some
exact
elementary
knowledge
in
physics
chemistry
and
a
branch
of
natural
history
say
botany
with
the
physiology
connected
with
it
they
would
then
have
gained
necessary
knowledge
with
some
practice
in
inductive
reasoning
the
whole
studies
are
processes
of
observation
and
induction
the
best
discipline
of
the
mind
for
the
purposes
of
life
for
our
purposes
not
less
than
any
such
study
says
whewell
of
one
or
more
departments
of
inductive
science
the
mind
may
escape
from
the
thraldom
of
mere
words
by
that
plan
the
burden
of
the
early
medical
course
would
be
much
lightened
and
more
time
devoted
to
practical
studies
including
sir
thomas
and
supreme
stage
of
the
knowledge
of
medicine
on
the
educational
value
of
the
natural
history
sciences
the
subject
to
which
i
have
to
beg
your
attention
during
the
ensuing
hour
is
the
relation
of
physiological
science
to
other
branches
of
knowledge
had
circumstances
permitted
of
the
delivery
in
their
strict
logical
order
of
that
series
of
discourses
of
which
the
present
lecture
is
a
member
i
should
have
preceded
my
friend
and
colleague
henfrey
who
addressed
you
on
monday
last
but
while
for
the
sake
of
that
order
i
must
beg
you
to
suppose
that
this
discussion
of
the
educational
bearings
of
biology
in
general
precede
that
of
special
zoology
and
botany
i
am
rejoiced
to
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
light
thus
already
thrown
upon
the
tendency
and
methods
of
physiological
science
regarding
physiological
science
then
in
its
widest
sense
as
the
equivalent
of
the
science
of
individual
life
we
have
to
consider
in
succession
its
position
and
scope
as
a
branch
of
knowledge
its
value
as
a
means
of
mental
discipline
its
worth
as
practical
information
and
lastly
at
what
period
it
may
best
be
made
a
branch
of
education
our
conclusions
on
the
first
of
these
heads
must
depend
of
course
upon
the
nature
of
the
of
biology
and
i
think
a
few
preliminary
considerations
will
place
before
you
in
a
clear
light
the
vast
difference
which
exists
between
the
living
bodies
with
which
physiological
science
is
concerned
and
the
remainder
of
the
universe
between
the
ph√¶nomena
of
number
and
space
of
physical
and
of
chemical
force
on
the
one
hand
and
those
of
life
on
the
other
the
mathematician
the
physicist
and
the
chemist
contemplate
things
in
a
condition
of
rest
they
look
upon
a
state
of
equilibrium
as
that
to
which
all
bodies
normally
tend
the
mathematician
does
not
suppose
that
a
quantity
will
alter
or
that
a
given
point
in
space
will
change
its
direction
with
regard
to
another
point
spontaneously
and
it
is
the
same
with
the
physicist
when
newton
saw
the
apple
fall
he
concluded
at
once
that
the
act
of
falling
was
not
the
result
of
any
power
inherent
in
the
apple
but
that
it
was
the
result
of
the
action
of
something
else
on
the
apple
in
a
similar
manner
all
physical
force
is
regarded
as
the
disturbance
of
an
equilibrium
to
which
things
tended
before
its
exertion
to
which
they
will
tend
again
after
its
cessation
the
chemist
equally
regards
chemical
change
in
a
as
the
effect
of
the
action
of
something
external
to
the
body
changed
a
chemical
compound
once
formed
would
persist
for
ever
if
no
alteration
took
place
in
surrounding
conditions
but
to
the
student
of
life
the
aspect
of
nature
is
reversed
here
incessant
and
so
far
as
we
know
spontaneous
change
is
the
rule
rest
the
exception
the
anomaly
to
be
accounted
for
living
things
have
no
inertia
and
tend
to
no
equilibrium
permit
me
however
to
give
more
force
and
clearness
to
these
somewhat
abstract
considerations
by
an
illustration
or
two
imagine
a
vessel
full
of
water
at
the
ordinary
temperature
in
an
atmosphere
saturated
with
vapour
the
and
the
of
that
water
will
not
change
so
far
as
we
know
for
ever
suppose
a
lump
of
gold
be
thrown
into
the
vessel
motion
and
disturbance
of
figure
exactly
proportional
to
the
momentum
of
the
gold
will
take
place
but
after
a
time
the
effects
of
this
disturbance
will
subside
equilibrium
will
be
restored
and
the
water
will
return
to
its
passive
state
expose
the
water
to
cold
it
will
solidify
and
in
so
doing
its
particles
will
arrange
themselves
in
definite
crystalline
shapes
but
once
formed
these
crystals
change
no
further
again
substitute
for
the
lump
of
gold
some
substance
capable
of
entering
into
chemical
relations
with
the
water
say
a
mass
of
that
substance
which
is
called
protein
the
substance
of
flesh
a
very
considerable
disturbance
of
equilibrium
will
take
place
all
sorts
of
chemical
compositions
and
decompositions
will
occur
but
in
the
end
as
before
the
result
will
be
the
resumption
of
a
condition
of
rest
instead
of
such
a
mass
of
protein
however
take
a
particle
of
protein
one
of
those
minute
microscopic
living
things
which
throng
our
pools
and
are
known
as
infusoria
such
a
creature
for
instance
as
an
euglena
and
place
it
in
our
vessel
of
water
it
is
a
round
mass
provided
with
a
long
filament
and
except
in
this
peculiarity
of
shape
presents
no
appreciable
physical
or
chemical
difference
whereby
it
might
be
distinguished
from
the
particle
of
dead
protein
but
the
difference
in
the
ph√¶nomena
to
which
it
will
give
rise
is
immense
in
the
first
place
it
will
develop
a
vast
quantity
of
physical
force
cleaving
the
water
in
all
directions
with
considerable
rapidity
by
means
of
the
vibrations
of
the
long
filament
or
cilium
nor
is
the
amount
of
chemical
energy
which
the
little
creature
possesses
less
striking
it
is
a
perfect
laboratory
in
itself
and
it
will
act
and
react
upon
the
water
and
the
matters
contained
therein
converting
them
into
new
compounds
resembling
its
own
substance
and
at
the
same
time
giving
up
portions
of
its
own
substance
which
have
become
effete
furthermore
the
euglena
will
increase
in
size
but
this
increase
is
by
no
means
unlimited
as
the
increase
of
a
crystal
might
be
after
it
has
grown
to
a
certain
extent
it
divides
and
each
portion
assumes
the
form
of
the
original
and
proceeds
to
repeat
the
process
of
growth
and
division
nor
is
this
all
for
after
a
series
of
such
divisions
and
subdivisions
these
minute
points
assume
a
totally
new
form
lose
their
long
tails
round
themselves
and
secrete
a
sort
of
envelope
or
box
in
which
they
remain
shut
up
for
a
time
eventually
to
resume
directly
or
indirectly
their
primitive
mode
of
existence
now
so
far
as
we
know
there
is
no
natural
limit
to
the
existence
of
the
euglena
or
of
any
other
living
germ
a
living
species
once
launched
into
existence
tends
to
live
for
ever
consider
how
widely
different
this
living
particle
is
from
the
dead
atoms
with
which
the
physicist
and
chemist
have
to
do
the
particle
of
gold
falls
to
the
bottom
and
rests
the
particle
of
dead
protein
decomposes
and
disappears
it
also
rests
but
the
protein
mass
neither
tends
to
exhaustion
of
its
forces
nor
to
any
permanency
of
form
but
is
essentially
distinguished
as
a
disturber
of
equilibrium
so
far
as
force
is
concerned
as
undergoing
continual
metamorphosis
and
change
in
point
of
form
tendency
to
equilibrium
of
force
and
to
permanency
of
form
then
are
the
characters
of
that
portion
of
the
universe
which
does
not
live
the
domain
of
the
chemist
and
physicist
tendency
to
disturb
existing
equilibrium
to
take
on
forms
which
succeed
one
another
in
definite
cycles
is
the
character
of
the
living
world
what
is
the
cause
of
this
wonderful
difference
between
the
dead
particle
and
the
living
particle
of
matter
appearing
in
other
respects
identical
that
difference
to
which
we
give
the
name
of
life
i
for
one
can
not
tell
you
it
may
be
that
by
and
by
philosophers
will
discover
some
higher
laws
of
which
the
facts
of
life
are
particular
cases
very
possibly
they
will
find
out
some
bond
between
ph√¶nomena
on
the
one
hand
and
vital
ph√¶nomena
on
the
other
at
present
however
we
assuredly
know
of
none
and
i
think
we
shall
exercise
a
wise
humility
in
confessing
that
for
us
at
least
this
successive
assumption
of
different
states
external
conditions
remaining
the
same
this
of
if
i
may
use
a
term
which
implies
more
than
i
would
be
answerable
for
which
constitutes
so
vast
and
plain
a
practical
distinction
between
living
bodies
and
those
which
do
not
live
is
an
ultimate
fact
indicating
as
such
the
existence
of
a
broad
line
of
demarcation
between
the
of
biological
and
that
of
all
other
sciences
for
i
would
have
it
understood
that
this
simple
euglena
is
the
type
of
living
things
so
far
as
the
distinction
between
these
and
inert
matter
is
concerned
that
cycle
of
changes
which
is
constituted
by
perhaps
not
more
than
two
or
three
steps
in
the
euglena
is
as
clearly
manifested
in
the
multitudinous
stages
through
which
the
germ
of
an
oak
or
of
a
man
passes
whatever
forms
the
living
being
may
take
on
whether
simple
or
complex
are
the
ph√¶nomena
which
distinguish
it
from
that
which
does
not
live
if
this
be
true
it
is
clear
that
the
student
in
passing
from
the
to
the
physiological
sciences
enters
upon
a
totally
new
order
of
facts
and
it
will
next
be
for
us
to
consider
how
far
these
new
facts
involve
methods
or
require
a
modification
of
those
with
which
he
is
already
acquainted
now
a
great
deal
is
said
about
the
peculiarity
of
the
scientific
method
in
general
and
of
the
different
methods
which
are
pursued
in
the
different
sciences
the
mathematics
are
said
to
have
one
special
method
physics
another
biology
a
third
and
so
forth
for
my
own
part
i
must
confess
that
i
do
not
understand
this
phraseology
so
far
as
i
can
arrive
at
any
clear
comprehension
of
the
matter
science
is
not
as
many
would
seem
to
suppose
a
modification
of
the
black
art
suited
to
the
tastes
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
flourishing
mainly
in
consequence
of
the
decay
of
the
inquisition
science
is
i
believe
nothing
but
and
organized
common
differing
from
the
latter
only
as
a
veteran
may
differ
from
a
raw
recruit
and
its
methods
differ
from
those
of
common
sense
only
so
far
as
the
guardsman
cut
and
thrust
differ
from
the
manner
in
which
a
savage
wields
his
club
the
primary
power
is
the
same
in
each
case
and
perhaps
the
untutored
savage
has
the
more
brawny
arm
of
the
two
the
advantage
lies
in
the
point
and
polish
of
the
swordsman
weapon
in
the
trained
eye
quick
to
spy
out
the
weakness
of
the
adversary
in
the
ready
hand
prompt
to
follow
it
on
the
instant
but
after
all
the
sword
exercise
is
only
the
hewing
and
poking
of
the
clubman
developed
and
perfected
so
the
vast
results
obtained
by
science
are
won
by
no
mystical
faculties
by
no
mental
processes
other
than
those
which
are
practised
by
every
one
of
us
in
the
humblest
and
meanest
affairs
of
life
a
detective
policeman
discovers
a
burglar
from
the
marks
made
by
his
shoe
by
a
mental
process
identical
with
that
by
which
cuvier
restored
the
extinct
animals
of
montmartre
from
fragments
of
their
bones
nor
does
that
process
of
induction
and
deduction
by
which
a
lady
finding
a
stain
of
a
peculiar
kind
upon
her
dress
concludes
that
somebody
has
upset
the
inkstand
thereon
differ
in
any
way
in
kind
from
that
by
which
adams
and
leverrier
discovered
a
new
planet
the
man
of
science
in
fact
simply
uses
with
scrupulous
exactness
the
methods
which
we
all
habitually
and
at
every
moment
use
carelessly
and
the
man
of
business
must
as
much
avail
himself
of
the
scientific
method
must
be
as
truly
a
man
of
science
as
the
veriest
bookworm
of
us
all
though
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
man
of
business
will
find
himself
out
to
be
a
philosopher
with
as
much
surprise
as
jourdain
exhibited
when
he
discovered
that
he
had
been
all
his
life
talking
prose
if
however
there
be
no
real
difference
between
the
methods
of
science
and
those
of
common
life
it
would
seem
on
the
face
of
the
matter
highly
improbable
that
there
should
be
any
difference
between
the
methods
of
the
different
sciences
nevertheless
it
is
constantly
taken
for
granted
that
there
is
a
very
wide
difference
between
the
physiological
and
other
sciences
in
point
of
method
in
the
first
place
it
is
said
and
i
take
this
point
first
because
the
imputation
is
too
frequently
admitted
by
physiologists
themselves
that
biology
differs
from
the
and
mathematical
sciences
in
being
inexact
now
this
phrase
inexact
must
refer
either
to
the
or
to
the
of
physiological
science
it
can
not
be
correct
to
apply
it
to
the
methods
for
as
i
hope
to
show
you
by
and
by
these
are
identical
in
all
sciences
and
whatever
is
true
of
physiological
method
is
true
of
physical
and
mathematical
method
is
it
then
the
of
biological
science
which
are
inexact
i
think
not
if
i
say
that
respiration
is
performed
by
the
lungs
that
digestion
is
effected
in
the
stomach
that
the
eye
is
the
organ
of
sight
that
the
jaws
of
a
vertebrated
animal
never
open
sideways
but
always
up
and
down
while
those
of
an
annulose
animal
always
open
sideways
and
never
up
and
down
i
am
enumerating
propositions
which
are
as
exact
as
anything
in
euclid
how
then
has
this
notion
of
the
inexactness
of
biological
science
come
about
i
believe
from
two
causes
first
because
in
consequence
of
the
great
complexity
of
the
science
and
the
multitude
of
interfering
conditions
we
are
very
often
only
enabled
to
predict
approximatively
what
will
occur
under
given
circumstances
and
secondly
because
on
account
of
the
comparative
youth
of
the
physiological
sciences
a
great
many
of
their
laws
are
still
imperfectly
worked
out
but
in
an
educational
point
of
view
it
is
most
important
to
distinguish
between
the
essence
of
a
science
and
the
accidents
which
surround
it
and
essentially
the
methods
and
results
of
physiology
are
as
exact
as
those
of
physics
or
mathematics
it
is
said
that
the
physiological
method
is
especially
and
this
dictum
also
finds
favour
in
the
eyes
of
many
i
should
be
sorry
to
suggest
that
the
speculators
on
scientific
classification
have
been
misled
by
the
accident
of
the
name
of
one
leading
branch
of
biology
but
i
would
ask
whether
and
that
classification
which
is
the
result
of
comparison
are
not
the
essence
of
every
science
whatsoever
how
is
it
possible
to
discover
a
relation
of
cause
and
effect
of
kind
without
comparing
a
series
of
cases
together
in
which
the
supposed
cause
and
effect
occur
singly
or
combined
so
far
from
comparison
being
in
any
way
peculiar
to
biological
science
it
is
i
think
the
essence
of
every
science
a
speculative
philosopher
again
tells
us
that
the
biological
sciences
are
distinguished
by
being
sciences
of
observation
and
not
of
experiment
of
all
the
strange
assertions
into
which
speculation
without
practical
acquaintance
with
a
subject
may
lead
even
an
able
man
i
think
this
is
the
very
strangest
physiology
not
an
experimental
science
why
there
is
not
a
function
of
a
single
organ
in
the
body
which
has
not
been
determined
wholly
and
solely
by
experiment
how
did
harvey
determine
the
nature
of
the
circulation
except
by
experiment
how
did
sir
charles
bell
determine
the
functions
of
the
roots
of
the
spinal
nerves
save
by
experiment
how
do
we
know
the
use
of
a
nerve
at
all
except
by
experiment
nay
how
do
you
know
even
that
your
eye
is
your
seeing
apparatus
unless
you
make
the
experiment
of
shutting
it
or
that
your
ear
is
your
hearing
apparatus
unless
you
close
it
up
and
thereby
discover
that
you
become
deaf
it
would
really
be
much
more
true
to
say
that
physiology
is
experimental
science
of
all
sciences
that
in
which
there
is
least
to
be
learnt
by
mere
observation
and
that
which
affords
the
greatest
field
for
the
exercise
of
those
faculties
which
characterise
the
experimental
philosopher
i
confess
if
any
one
were
to
ask
me
for
a
model
application
of
the
logic
of
experiment
i
should
know
no
better
work
to
put
into
his
hands
than
bernard
late
researches
on
the
functions
of
the
liver
not
to
give
this
lecture
a
too
controversial
tone
however
i
must
only
advert
to
one
more
doctrine
held
by
a
thinker
of
our
own
age
and
country
whose
opinions
are
worthy
of
all
respect
it
is
that
the
biological
sciences
differ
from
all
others
inasmuch
as
in
classification
takes
place
by
type
and
not
by
definition
it
is
said
in
short
that
a
class
is
not
capable
of
being
defined
that
the
class
rosace√¶
for
instance
or
the
class
of
fishes
is
not
accurately
and
absolutely
definable
inasmuch
as
its
members
will
present
exceptions
to
every
possible
definition
and
that
the
members
of
the
class
are
united
together
only
by
the
circumstance
that
they
are
all
more
like
some
imaginary
average
rose
or
average
fish
than
they
resemble
anything
else
but
here
as
before
i
think
the
distinction
has
arisen
entirely
from
confusing
a
transitory
imperfection
with
an
essential
character
so
long
as
our
information
concerning
them
is
imperfect
we
class
all
objects
together
according
to
resemblances
which
we
but
can
not
we
group
them
round
in
short
thus
if
you
ask
an
ordinary
person
what
kinds
of
animals
there
are
he
will
probably
say
beasts
birds
reptiles
fishes
insects
ask
him
to
define
a
beast
from
a
reptile
and
he
can
not
do
it
but
he
says
things
like
a
cow
or
a
horse
are
beasts
and
things
like
a
frog
or
a
lizard
are
reptiles
you
see
class
by
type
and
not
by
definition
but
how
does
this
classification
differ
from
that
of
the
scientific
zoologist
how
does
the
meaning
of
the
scientific
of
mammalia
differ
from
the
unscientific
of
beasts
why
exactly
because
the
former
depends
on
a
definition
the
latter
on
a
type
the
class
mammalia
is
scientifically
defined
as
all
animals
which
have
a
vertebrated
skeleton
and
suckle
their
young
here
is
no
reference
to
type
but
a
definition
rigorous
enough
for
a
geometrician
and
such
is
the
character
which
every
scientific
naturalist
recognises
as
that
to
which
his
classes
must
aspire
knowing
as
he
does
that
classification
by
type
is
simply
an
acknowledgment
of
ignorance
and
a
temporary
device
so
much
in
the
way
of
negative
argument
as
against
the
reputed
differences
between
biological
and
other
methods
no
such
differences
i
believe
really
exist
the
of
biological
science
is
different
from
that
of
other
sciences
but
the
methods
of
all
are
identical
and
these
methods
are
of
facts
including
under
this
head
that
which
is
called
that
process
of
tying
up
similar
facts
into
bundles
ticketed
and
ready
for
use
which
is
called
and
the
results
of
the
process
the
ticketed
bundles
being
named
which
takes
us
from
the
general
proposition
to
facts
again
teaches
us
if
i
may
so
say
to
anticipate
from
the
ticket
what
is
inside
the
bundle
and
finally
which
is
the
process
of
ascertaining
whether
in
point
of
fact
our
anticipation
is
a
correct
one
such
are
the
methods
of
all
science
whatsoever
but
perhaps
you
will
permit
me
to
give
you
an
illustration
of
their
employment
in
the
science
of
life
and
i
will
take
as
a
special
case
the
establishment
of
the
doctrine
of
the
of
the
in
this
case
yields
us
a
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
blood
from
some
accidental
h√¶morrhage
we
will
say
we
may
even
grant
that
it
informs
us
of
the
localization
of
this
blood
in
particular
vessels
the
heart
from
some
accidental
cut
or
the
like
it
teaches
also
the
existence
of
a
pulse
in
various
parts
of
the
body
and
acquaints
us
with
the
structure
of
the
heart
and
vessels
here
however
stops
and
we
must
have
recourse
to
you
tie
a
vein
and
you
find
that
the
blood
accumulates
on
the
side
of
the
ligature
opposite
the
heart
you
tie
an
artery
and
you
find
that
the
blood
accumulates
on
the
side
near
the
heart
open
the
chest
and
you
see
the
heart
contracting
with
great
force
make
openings
into
its
principal
cavities
and
you
will
find
that
all
the
blood
flows
out
and
no
more
pressure
is
exerted
on
either
side
of
the
arterial
or
venous
ligature
now
all
these
facts
taken
together
constitute
the
evidence
that
the
blood
is
propelled
by
the
heart
through
the
arteries
and
returns
by
the
veins
that
in
short
the
blood
circulates
suppose
our
experiments
and
observations
have
been
made
on
horses
then
we
group
and
ticket
them
into
a
general
proposition
thus
horses
have
a
circulation
of
their
henceforward
a
horse
is
a
sort
of
indication
or
label
telling
us
where
we
shall
find
a
peculiar
series
of
ph√¶nomena
called
the
circulation
of
the
blood
here
is
our
then
how
and
when
are
we
justified
in
making
our
next
step
a
from
it
suppose
our
physiologist
whose
experience
is
limited
to
horses
meets
with
a
zebra
for
the
first
time
will
he
suppose
that
this
generalization
holds
good
for
zebras
also
that
depends
very
much
on
his
turn
of
mind
but
we
will
suppose
him
to
be
a
bold
man
he
will
say
the
zebra
is
certainly
not
a
horse
but
it
is
very
like
one
so
like
that
it
must
be
the
or
mark
of
a
also
and
i
conclude
that
the
zebra
has
a
circulation
that
is
a
deduction
a
very
fair
deduction
but
by
no
means
to
be
considered
scientifically
secure
this
last
quality
in
fact
can
only
be
given
by
that
is
by
making
a
zebra
the
subject
of
all
the
experiments
performed
on
the
horse
of
course
in
the
present
case
the
would
be
by
this
process
of
verification
and
the
result
would
be
not
merely
a
positive
widening
of
knowledge
but
a
fair
increase
of
confidence
in
the
truth
of
one
generalizations
in
other
cases
thus
having
settled
the
point
in
the
zebra
and
horse
our
philosopher
would
have
great
confidence
in
the
existence
of
a
circulation
in
the
ass
nay
i
fancy
most
persons
would
excuse
him
if
in
this
case
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
go
through
the
process
of
verification
at
all
and
it
would
not
be
without
a
parallel
in
the
history
of
the
human
mind
if
our
imaginary
physiologist
now
maintained
that
he
was
acquainted
with
asinine
circulation
however
if
i
might
impress
any
caution
upon
your
minds
it
is
the
utterly
conditional
nature
of
all
our
knowledge
the
danger
of
neglecting
the
process
of
verification
under
any
circumstances
and
the
film
upon
which
we
rest
the
moment
our
deductions
carry
us
beyond
the
reach
of
this
great
process
of
verification
there
is
no
better
instance
of
this
than
is
afforded
by
the
history
of
our
knowledge
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
in
the
animal
kingdom
until
the
year
in
every
animal
possessing
a
circulation
at
all
which
had
been
observed
up
to
that
time
the
current
of
the
blood
was
known
to
take
one
definite
and
invariable
direction
now
there
is
a
class
of
animals
called
which
possess
a
heart
and
a
circulation
and
up
to
the
period
of
which
i
speak
no
one
would
have
dreamt
of
questioning
the
propriety
of
the
deduction
that
these
creatures
have
a
circulation
in
one
direction
nor
would
any
one
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
verify
the
point
but
in
that
year
von
hasselt
happening
to
examine
a
transparent
animal
of
this
class
found
to
his
infinite
surprise
that
after
the
heart
had
beat
a
certain
number
of
times
it
stopped
and
then
began
beating
the
opposite
way
so
as
to
reverse
the
course
of
the
current
which
returned
by
and
by
to
its
original
direction
i
have
myself
timed
the
heart
of
these
little
animals
i
found
it
as
regular
as
possible
in
its
periods
of
reversal
and
i
know
no
spectacle
in
the
animal
kingdom
more
wonderful
than
that
which
it
presents
all
the
more
wonderful
that
to
this
day
it
remains
an
unique
fact
peculiar
to
this
class
among
the
whole
animated
world
at
the
same
time
i
know
of
no
more
striking
case
of
the
necessity
of
the
of
even
those
deductions
which
seem
founded
on
the
widest
and
safest
inductions
such
are
the
methods
of
biology
methods
which
are
obviously
identical
with
those
of
all
other
sciences
and
therefore
wholly
incompetent
to
form
the
ground
of
any
distinction
between
it
and
them
but
i
shall
be
asked
at
once
do
you
mean
to
say
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
habit
of
mind
of
a
mathematician
and
that
of
a
naturalist
do
you
imagine
that
laplace
might
have
been
put
into
the
jardin
des
plantes
and
cuvier
into
the
observatory
with
equal
advantage
to
the
progress
of
the
sciences
they
professed
to
which
i
would
reply
that
nothing
could
be
further
from
my
thoughts
but
different
habits
and
various
special
tendencies
of
two
sciences
do
not
imply
different
methods
the
mountaineer
and
the
man
of
the
plains
have
very
different
habits
of
progression
and
each
would
be
at
a
loss
in
the
other
place
but
the
method
of
progression
by
putting
one
leg
before
the
other
is
the
same
in
each
case
every
step
of
each
is
a
combination
of
a
lift
and
a
push
but
the
mountaineer
lifts
more
and
the
lowlander
pushes
more
and
i
think
the
case
of
two
sciences
resembles
this
i
do
not
question
for
a
moment
that
while
the
mathematician
is
busied
with
deductions
general
propositions
the
biologist
is
more
especially
occupied
with
observation
comparison
and
those
processes
which
lead
general
propositions
all
i
wish
to
insist
upon
is
that
this
difference
depends
not
on
any
fundamental
distinction
in
the
sciences
themselves
but
on
the
accidents
of
their
of
their
relative
complexity
and
consequent
relative
perfection
the
mathematician
deals
with
two
properties
of
objects
only
number
and
extension
and
all
the
inductions
he
wants
have
been
formed
and
finished
ages
ago
he
is
occupied
now
with
nothing
but
deduction
and
verification
the
biologist
deals
with
a
vast
number
of
properties
of
objects
and
his
inductions
will
not
be
completed
i
fear
for
ages
to
come
but
when
they
are
his
science
will
be
as
deductive
and
as
exact
as
the
mathematics
themselves
such
is
the
relation
of
biology
to
those
sciences
which
deal
with
objects
having
fewer
properties
than
itself
but
as
the
student
in
reaching
biology
looks
back
upon
sciences
of
a
less
complex
and
therefore
more
perfect
nature
so
on
the
other
hand
does
he
look
forward
to
other
more
complex
and
less
perfect
branches
of
knowledge
biology
deals
only
with
living
beings
as
isolated
things
treats
only
of
the
life
of
the
individual
but
there
is
a
higher
division
of
science
still
which
considers
living
beings
as
aggregates
which
deals
with
the
relation
of
living
beings
one
to
another
the
science
which
men
whose
are
made
by
nations
one
upon
another
in
whose
are
embodied
in
history
morality
and
religion
whose
lead
to
our
happiness
or
our
misery
and
whose
so
often
come
too
late
and
serve
only
to
point
a
moral
or
adorn
a
tale
i
mean
the
science
of
society
or
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
grandest
features
of
biology
that
it
occupies
this
central
position
in
human
knowledge
there
is
no
side
of
the
human
mind
which
physiological
study
leaves
uncultivated
connected
by
innumerable
ties
with
abstract
science
physiology
is
yet
in
the
most
intimate
relation
with
humanity
and
by
teaching
us
that
law
and
order
and
a
definite
scheme
of
development
regulate
even
the
strangest
and
wildest
manifestations
of
individual
life
she
prepares
the
student
to
look
for
a
goal
even
amidst
the
erratic
wanderings
of
mankind
and
to
believe
that
history
offers
something
more
than
an
entertaining
chaos
a
journal
of
a
toilsome
march
nowhither
the
preceding
considerations
have
i
hope
served
to
indicate
the
replies
which
befit
the
two
first
of
the
questions
which
i
set
before
you
at
starting
viz
what
is
the
range
and
position
of
physiological
science
as
a
branch
of
knowledge
and
what
is
its
value
as
a
means
of
mental
discipline
its
is
a
large
moiety
of
the
universe
its
is
midway
between
the
and
the
social
sciences
its
as
a
branch
of
discipline
is
partly
that
which
it
has
in
common
with
all
sciences
the
training
and
strengthening
of
common
sense
partly
that
which
is
more
peculiar
to
itself
the
great
exercise
which
it
affords
to
the
faculties
of
observation
and
comparison
and
i
may
add
the
of
knowledge
which
it
requires
on
the
part
of
those
among
its
votaries
who
desire
to
extend
its
boundaries
if
what
has
been
said
as
to
the
position
and
scope
of
biology
be
correct
our
third
question
what
is
the
practical
value
of
physiological
instruction
might
one
would
think
be
left
to
answer
itself
on
other
grounds
even
were
mankind
deserving
of
the
title
rational
which
they
arrogate
to
themselves
there
can
be
no
question
that
they
would
consider
as
the
most
necessary
of
all
branches
of
instruction
for
themselves
and
for
their
children
that
which
professes
to
acquaint
them
with
the
conditions
of
the
existence
they
prize
so
highly
which
teaches
them
how
to
avoid
disease
and
to
cherish
health
in
themselves
and
those
who
are
dear
to
them
i
am
addressing
i
imagine
an
audience
of
educated
persons
and
yet
i
dare
venture
to
assert
that
with
the
exception
of
those
of
my
hearers
who
may
chance
to
have
received
a
medical
education
there
is
not
one
who
could
tell
me
what
is
the
meaning
and
use
of
an
act
which
he
performs
a
score
of
times
every
minute
and
whose
suspension
would
involve
his
immediate
death
i
mean
the
act
of
breathing
or
who
could
state
in
precise
terms
why
it
is
that
a
confined
atmosphere
is
injurious
to
health
the
of
physiological
knowledge
why
is
it
that
educated
men
can
be
found
to
maintain
that
a
in
the
midst
of
a
great
city
is
rather
a
good
thing
than
otherwise
that
mothers
persist
in
exposing
the
largest
possible
amount
of
surface
of
their
children
to
the
cold
by
the
absurd
style
of
dress
they
adopt
and
then
marvel
at
the
peculiar
dispensation
of
providence
which
removes
their
infants
by
bronchitis
and
gastric
fever
why
is
it
that
quackery
rides
rampant
over
the
land
and
that
not
long
ago
one
of
the
largest
public
rooms
in
this
great
city
could
be
filled
by
an
audience
gravely
listening
to
the
reverend
expositor
of
the
doctrine
that
the
simple
physiological
phenomena
known
as
and
by
i
know
not
what
other
absurd
and
inappropriate
names
are
due
to
the
direct
and
personal
agency
of
satan
why
is
all
this
except
from
the
utter
ignorance
as
to
the
simplest
laws
of
their
own
animal
life
which
prevails
among
even
the
most
highly
educated
persons
in
this
country
but
there
are
other
branches
of
biological
science
besides
physiology
proper
whose
practical
influence
though
less
obvious
is
not
as
i
believe
less
certain
i
have
heard
educated
men
speak
with
an
contempt
of
the
studies
of
the
naturalist
and
ask
not
without
a
shrug
what
is
the
use
of
knowing
all
about
these
miserable
animals
what
bearing
has
it
on
human
life
i
will
endeavour
to
answer
that
question
i
take
it
that
all
will
admit
there
is
definite
government
of
this
universe
that
its
pleasures
and
pains
are
not
scattered
at
random
but
are
distributed
in
accordance
with
orderly
and
fixed
laws
and
that
it
is
only
in
accordance
with
all
we
know
of
the
rest
of
the
world
that
there
should
be
an
agreement
between
one
portion
of
the
sensitive
creation
and
another
in
these
matters
surely
then
it
interests
us
to
know
the
lot
of
other
animal
creatures
however
far
below
us
they
are
still
the
sole
created
things
which
share
with
us
the
capability
of
pleasure
and
the
susceptibility
to
pain
i
can
not
but
think
that
he
who
finds
a
certain
proportion
of
pain
and
evil
inseparably
woven
up
in
the
life
of
the
very
worms
will
bear
his
own
share
with
more
courage
and
submission
and
will
at
any
rate
view
with
suspicion
those
weakly
amiable
theories
of
the
divine
government
which
would
have
us
believe
pain
to
be
an
oversight
and
a
mistake
to
be
corrected
by
and
by
on
the
other
hand
the
predominance
of
happiness
among
living
things
their
lavish
beauty
the
secret
and
wonderful
harmony
which
pervades
them
all
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
are
equally
striking
refutations
of
that
modern
manichean
doctrine
which
exhibits
the
world
as
a
worked
with
many
tears
for
mere
utilitarian
ends
there
is
yet
another
way
in
which
natural
history
may
i
am
convinced
take
a
profound
hold
upon
practical
life
and
that
is
by
its
influence
over
our
finer
feelings
as
the
greatest
of
all
sources
of
that
pleasure
which
is
derivable
from
beauty
i
do
not
pretend
that
knowledge
as
such
can
increase
our
sense
of
the
beautiful
in
natural
objects
i
do
not
suppose
that
the
dead
soul
of
peter
bell
of
whom
the
great
poet
of
nature
says
a
primrose
by
the
river
brim
a
yellow
primrose
was
to
him
and
it
was
nothing
more
would
have
been
a
whit
roused
from
its
apathy
by
the
information
that
the
primrose
is
a
dicotyledonous
exogen
with
a
monopetalous
corolla
and
central
placentation
but
i
advocate
knowledge
from
this
point
of
view
because
it
would
lead
us
to
the
beauties
of
natural
objects
instead
of
trusting
to
chance
to
force
them
on
our
attention
to
a
person
uninstructed
in
natural
history
his
country
or
stroll
is
a
walk
through
a
gallery
filled
with
wonderful
works
of
art
of
which
have
their
faces
turned
to
the
wall
teach
him
something
of
natural
history
and
you
place
in
his
hands
a
catalogue
of
those
which
are
worth
turning
round
surely
our
innocent
pleasures
are
not
so
abundant
in
this
life
that
we
can
afford
to
despise
this
or
any
other
source
of
them
we
should
fear
being
banished
for
our
neglect
to
that
limbo
where
the
great
florentine
tells
us
are
those
who
during
this
life
wept
when
they
might
be
joyful
but
i
shall
be
trespassing
unwarrantably
on
your
kindness
if
i
do
not
proceed
at
once
to
my
last
point
the
time
at
which
physiological
science
should
first
form
a
part
of
the
curriculum
of
education
the
distinction
between
the
teaching
of
the
facts
of
a
science
as
instruction
and
the
teaching
it
systematically
as
knowledge
has
already
been
placed
before
you
in
a
previous
lecture
and
it
appears
to
me
that
as
with
other
sciences
the
of
biology
the
uses
of
parts
of
the
body
the
names
and
habits
of
the
living
creatures
which
surround
us
may
be
taught
with
advantage
to
the
youngest
child
indeed
the
avidity
of
children
for
this
kind
of
knowledge
and
the
comparative
ease
with
which
they
retain
it
is
something
quite
marvellous
i
doubt
whether
any
toy
would
be
so
acceptable
to
young
children
as
a
vivarium
of
the
same
kind
as
but
of
course
on
a
smaller
scale
than
those
admirable
devices
in
the
zoological
gardens
on
the
other
hand
systematic
teaching
in
biology
can
not
be
attempted
with
success
until
the
student
has
attained
to
a
certain
knowledge
of
physics
and
chemistry
for
though
the
ph√¶nomena
of
life
are
dependent
neither
on
physical
nor
on
chemical
but
on
vital
forces
yet
they
result
in
all
sorts
of
physical
and
chemical
changes
which
can
only
be
judged
by
their
own
laws
and
now
to
sum
up
in
a
few
words
the
conclusions
to
which
i
hope
you
see
reason
to
follow
me
biology
needs
no
apologist
when
she
demands
a
place
and
a
prominent
place
in
any
scheme
of
education
worthy
of
the
name
leave
out
the
physiological
sciences
from
your
curriculum
and
you
launch
the
student
into
the
world
undisciplined
in
that
science
whose
would
best
develop
his
powers
of
observation
ignorant
of
facts
of
the
deepest
importance
for
his
own
and
others
welfare
blind
to
the
richest
sources
of
beauty
in
god
creation
and
unprovided
with
that
belief
in
a
living
law
and
an
order
manifesting
itself
in
and
through
endless
change
and
variety
which
might
serve
to
check
and
moderate
that
phase
of
despair
through
which
if
he
take
an
earnest
interest
in
social
problems
he
will
assuredly
sooner
or
later
pass
finally
one
word
for
myself
i
have
not
hesitated
to
speak
strongly
where
i
have
felt
strongly
and
i
am
but
too
conscious
that
the
indicative
and
imperative
moods
have
too
often
taken
the
place
of
the
more
becoming
subjunctive
and
conditional
i
feel
therefore
how
necessary
it
is
to
beg
you
to
forget
the
personality
of
him
who
has
thus
ventured
to
address
you
and
to
consider
only
the
truth
or
error
in
what
has
been
said
footnotes
in
the
third
place
we
have
to
review
the
method
of
comparison
which
is
so
specially
adapted
to
the
study
of
living
bodies
and
by
which
above
all
others
that
study
must
be
advanced
in
astronomy
this
method
is
necessarily
inapplicable
and
it
is
not
till
we
arrive
at
chemistry
that
this
third
means
of
investigation
can
be
used
and
then
only
in
subordination
to
the
two
others
it
is
in
the
study
both
statical
and
dynamical
of
living
bodies
that
it
first
acquires
its
full
development
and
its
use
elsewhere
can
be
only
through
its
application

the

natural
history
is
the
name
familiarly
applied
to
the
study
of
the
properties
of
such
natural
bodies
as
minerals
plants
and

the
sciences
which
embody
the
knowledge
man
has
acquired
upon
these
subjects
are
commonly
termed
natural
sciences
in
contradistinction
to
other
physical
sciences
and
those
who
devote
themselves
especially
to
the
pursuit
of
such
sciences
have
been
and
are
commonly
termed
naturalists
linn√¶us
was
a
naturalist
in
this
wide
sense
and
his
systema
natur√¶
was
a
work
upon
natural
history
in
the
broadest
acceptation
of
the
term
in
it
that
great
methodizing
spirit
embodied
all
that
was
known
in
his
time
of
the
distinctive
characters
of
minerals
animals
and
plants
but
the
enormous
stimulus
which
linn√¶us
gave
to
the
investigation
of
nature
soon
rendered
it
impossible
that
any
one
man
should
write
another
systema
natur√¶
and
extremely
difficult
for
any
one
to
become
a
naturalist
such
as
linn√¶us
was
great
as
have
been
the
advances
made
by
all
the
three
branches
of
science
of
old
included
under
the
title
of
natural
history
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
zoology
and
botany
have
grown
in
an
enormously
greater
ratio
than
mineralogy
and
hence
as
i
suppose
the
name
of
natural
history
has
gradually
become
more
and
more
definitely
attached
to
these
prominent
divisions
of
the
subject
and
by
naturalist
people
have
meant
more
and
more
distinctly
to
imply
a
student
of
the
structure
and
functions
of
living
beings
however
this
may
be
it
is
certain
that
the
advance
of
knowledge
has
gradually
widened
the
distance
between
mineralogy
and
its
old
associates
while
it
has
drawn
zoology
and
botany
closer
together
so
that
of
late
years
it
has
been
found
convenient
and
indeed
necessary
to
associate
the
sciences
which
deal
with
vitality
and
all
its
phenomena
under
the
common
head
of
biology
and
the
biologists
have
come
to
repudiate
any
with
their
the
mineralogists
certain
broad
laws
have
a
general
application
throughout
both
the
animal
and
the
vegetable
worlds
but
the
ground
common
to
these
kingdoms
of
nature
is
not
of
very
wide
extent
and
the
multiplicity
of
details
is
so
great
that
the
student
of
living
beings
finds
himself
obliged
to
devote
his
attention
exclusively
either
to
the
one
or
the
other
if
he
elects
to
study
plants
under
any
aspect
we
know
at
once
what
to
call
him
he
is
a
botanist
and
his
science
is
botany
but
if
the
investigation
of
animal
life
be
his
choice
the
name
generally
applied
to
him
will
vary
according
to
the
kind
of
animals
he
studies
or
the
particular
phenomena
of
animal
life
to
which
he
confines
his
attention
if
the
study
of
man
is
his
object
he
is
called
an
anatomist
or
a
physiologist
or
an
ethnologist
but
if
he
dissects
animals
or
examines
into
the
mode
in
which
their
functions
are
performed
he
is
a
comparative
anatomist
or
comparative
physiologist
if
he
turns
his
attention
to
fossil
animals
he
is
a
pal√¶ontologist
if
his
mind
is
more
particularly
directed
to
the
description
specific
discrimination
classification
and
distribution
of
animals
he
is
termed
a
zoologist
for
the
purposes
of
the
present
discourse
however
i
shall
recognise
none
of
these
titles
save
the
last
which
i
shall
employ
as
the
equivalent
of
botanist
and
i
shall
use
the
term
zoology
as
denoting
the
whole
doctrine
of
animal
life
in
contradistinction
to
botany
which
signifies
the
whole
doctrine
of
vegetable
life
employed
in
this
sense
zoology
like
botany
is
divisible
into
three
great
but
subordinate
sciences
morphology
physiology
and
distribution
each
of
which
may
to
a
very
great
extent
be
studied
independently
of
the
other
zoological
morphology
is
the
doctrine
of
animal
form
or
structure
anatomy
is
one
of
its
branches
development
is
another
while
classification
is
the
expression
of
the
relations
which
different
animals
bear
to
one
another
in
respect
of
their
anatomy
and
their
development
zoological
distribution
is
the
study
of
animals
in
relation
to
the
terrestrial
conditions
which
obtain
now
or
have
obtained
at
any
previous
epoch
of
the
earth
history
zoological
physiology
lastly
is
the
doctrine
of
the
functions
or
actions
of
animals
it
regards
animal
bodies
as
machines
impelled
by
certain
forces
and
performing
an
amount
of
work
which
can
be
expressed
in
terms
of
the
ordinary
forces
of
nature
the
final
object
of
physiology
is
to
deduce
the
facts
of
morphology
on
the
one
hand
and
those
of
distribution
on
the
other
from
the
laws
of
the
molecular
forces
of
matter
such
is
the
scope
of
zoology
but
if
i
were
to
content
myself
with
the
enunciation
of
these
dry
definitions
i
should
ill
exemplify
that
method
of
teaching
this
branch
of
physical
science
which
it
is
my
chief
business
to
recommend
let
us
turn
away
then
from
abstract
definitions
let
us
take
some
concrete
living
thing
some
animal
the
commoner
the
better
and
let
us
see
how
the
application
of
common
sense
and
common
logic
to
the
obvious
facts
it
presents
inevitably
leads
us
into
all
these
branches
of
zoological
science
i
have
before
me
a
lobster
when
i
examine
it
what
appears
to
be
the
most
striking
character
it
presents
why
i
observe
that
this
part
which
we
call
the
tail
of
the
lobster
is
made
up
of
six
distinct
hard
rings
and
a
seventh
terminal
piece
if
i
separate
one
of
the
middle
rings
say
the
third
i
find
it
carries
upon
its
under
surface
a
pair
of
limbs
or
appendages
each
of
which
consists
of
a
stalk
and
two
terminal
pieces
so
that
i
can
represent
a
transverse
section
of
the
ring
and
its
appendages
upon
the
diagram
board
in
this
way
if
i
now
take
the
fourth
ring
i
find
it
has
the
same
structure
and
so
have
the
fifth
and
the
second
so
that
in
each
of
these
divisions
of
the
tail
i
find
parts
which
correspond
with
one
another
a
ring
and
two
appendages
and
in
each
appendage
a
stalk
and
two
end
pieces
these
corresponding
parts
are
called
in
the
technical
language
of
anatomy
homologous
parts
the
ring
of
the
third
division
is
the
homologue
of
the
ring
of
the
fifth
the
appendage
of
the
former
is
the
homologue
of
the
appendage
of
the
latter
and
as
each
division
exhibits
corresponding
parts
in
corresponding
places
we
say
that
all
the
divisions
are
constructed
upon
the
same
plan
but
now
let
us
consider
the
sixth
division
it
is
similar
to
and
yet
different
from
the
others
the
ring
is
essentially
the
same
as
in
the
other
divisions
but
the
appendages
look
at
first
as
if
they
were
very
different
and
yet
when
we
regard
them
closely
what
do
we
find
a
stalk
and
two
terminal
divisions
exactly
as
in
the
others
but
the
stalk
is
very
short
and
very
thick
the
terminal
divisions
are
very
broad
and
flat
and
one
of
them
is
divided
into
two
pieces
i
may
say
therefore
that
the
sixth
segment
is
like
the
others
in
plan
but
that
it
is
modified
in
its
details
the
first
segment
is
like
the
others
so
far
as
its
ring
is
concerned
and
though
its
appendages
differ
from
any
of
those
yet
examined
in
the
simplicity
of
their
structure
parts
corresponding
with
the
stem
and
one
of
the
divisions
of
the
appendages
of
the
other
segments
can
be
readily
discerned
in
them
thus
it
appears
that
the
lobster
tail
is
composed
of
a
series
of
segments
which
are
fundamentally
similar
though
each
presents
peculiar
modifications
of
the
plan
common
to
all
but
when
i
turn
to
the
fore
part
of
the
body
i
see
at
first
nothing
but
a
great
shell
called
technically
the
carapace
ending
in
front
in
a
sharp
spine
on
either
side
of
which
are
the
curious
compound
eyes
set
upon
the
ends
of
stout
moveable
stalks
behind
these
on
the
under
side
of
the
body
are
two
pairs
of
long
feelers
or
antenn√¶
followed
by
six
pairs
of
jaws
folded
against
one
another
over
the
mouth
and
five
pairs
of
legs
the
foremost
of
these
being
the
great
pinchers
or
claws
of
the
lobster
it
looks
at
first
a
little
hopeless
to
attempt
to
find
in
this
complex
mass
a
series
of
rings
each
with
its
pair
of
appendages
such
as
i
have
shown
you
in
the
abdomen
and
yet
it
is
not
difficult
to
demonstrate
their
existence
strip
off
the
legs
and
you
will
find
that
each
pair
is
attached
to
a
very
definite
segment
of
the
under
wall
of
the
body
but
these
segments
instead
of
being
the
lower
parts
of
free
rings
as
in
the
tail
are
such
parts
of
rings
which
are
all
solidly
united
and
bound
together
and
the
like
is
true
of
the
jaws
the
feelers
and
the
every
pair
of
which
is
borne
upon
its
own
special
segment
thus
the
conclusion
is
gradually
forced
upon
us
that
the
body
of
the
lobster
is
composed
of
as
many
rings
as
there
are
pairs
of
appendages
namely
twenty
in
all
but
that
the
six
hindmost
rings
remain
free
and
moveable
while
the
fourteen
front
rings
become
firmly
soldered
together
their
backs
forming
one
continuous
shield
the
carapace
unity
of
plan
diversity
in
execution
is
the
lesson
taught
by
the
study
of
the
rings
of
the
body
and
the
same
instruction
is
given
still
more
emphatically
by
the
appendages
if
i
examine
the
outermost
jaw
i
find
it
consists
of
three
distinct
portions
an
inner
a
middle
and
an
outer
mounted
upon
a
common
stem
and
if
i
compare
this
jaw
with
the
legs
behind
it
or
the
jaws
in
front
of
it
i
find
it
quite
easy
to
see
that
in
the
legs
it
is
the
part
of
the
appendage
which
corresponds
with
the
inner
division
which
becomes
modified
into
what
we
know
familiarly
as
the
leg
while
the
middle
division
disappears
and
the
outer
division
is
hidden
under
the
carapace
nor
is
it
more
difficult
to
discern
that
in
the
appendages
of
the
tail
the
middle
division
appears
again
and
the
outer
vanishes
while
on
the
other
hand
in
the
foremost
jaw
the
mandible
the
inner
division
only
is
left
and
in
the
same
way
the
parts
of
the
feelers
and
of
the
can
be
identified
with
those
of
the
legs
and
jaws
but
whither
does
all
this
tend
to
the
very
remarkable
conclusion
that
a
unity
of
plan
of
the
same
kind
as
that
discoverable
in
the
tail
or
abdomen
of
the
lobster
pervades
the
whole
organization
of
its
skeleton
so
that
i
can
return
to
the
diagram
representing
any
one
of
the
rings
of
the
tail
which
i
drew
upon
the
board
and
by
adding
a
third
division
to
each
appendage
i
can
use
it
as
a
sort
of
scheme
or
plan
of
any
ring
of
the
body
i
can
give
names
to
all
the
parts
of
that
figure
and
then
if
i
take
any
segment
of
the
body
of
the
lobster
i
can
point
out
to
you
exactly
what
modification
the
general
plan
has
undergone
in
that
particular
segment
what
part
has
remained
moveable
and
what
has
become
fixed
to
another
what
has
been
excessively
developed
and
metamorphosed
and
what
has
been
suppressed
but
i
imagine
i
hear
the
question
how
is
all
this
to
be
tested
no
doubt
it
is
a
pretty
and
ingenious
way
of
looking
at
the
structure
of
any
animal
but
is
it
anything
more
does
nature
acknowledge
in
any
deeper
way
this
unity
of
plan
we
seem
to
trace
the
objection
suggested
by
these
questions
is
a
very
valid
and
important
one
and
morphology
was
in
an
unsound
state
so
long
as
it
rested
upon
the
mere
perception
of
the
analogies
which
obtain
between
fully
formed
parts
the
unchecked
ingenuity
of
speculative
anatomists
proved
itself
fully
competent
to
spin
any
number
of
contradictory
hypotheses
out
of
the
same
facts
and
endless
morphological
dreams
threatened
to
supplant
scientific
theory
happily
however
there
is
a
criterion
of
morphological
truth
and
a
sure
test
of
all
homologies
our
lobster
has
not
always
been
what
we
see
it
it
was
once
an
egg
a
semifluid
mass
of
yolk
not
so
big
as
a
head
contained
in
a
transparent
membrane
and
exhibiting
not
the
least
trace
of
any
one
of
those
organs
whose
multiplicity
and
complexity
in
the
adult
are
so
surprising
after
a
time
a
delicate
patch
of
cellular
membrane
appeared
upon
one
face
of
this
yolk
and
that
patch
was
the
foundation
of
the
whole
creature
the
clay
out
of
which
it
would
be
moulded
gradually
investing
the
yolk
it
became
subdivided
by
transverse
constrictions
into
segments
the
forerunners
of
the
rings
of
the
body
upon
the
ventral
surface
of
each
of
the
rings
thus
sketched
out
a
pair
of
prominences
made
their
appearance
the
rudiments
of
the
appendages
of
the
ring
at
first
all
the
appendages
were
alike
but
as
they
grew
most
of
them
became
distinguished
into
a
stem
and
two
terminal
divisions
to
which
in
the
middle
part
of
the
body
was
added
a
third
outer
division
and
it
was
only
at
a
later
period
that
by
the
modification
or
absorption
of
certain
of
these
primitive
constituents
the
limbs
acquired
their
perfect
form
thus
the
study
of
development
proves
that
the
doctrine
of
unity
of
plan
is
not
merely
a
fancy
that
it
is
not
merely
one
way
of
looking
at
the
matter
but
that
it
is
the
expression
of
natural
facts
the
legs
and
jaws
of
the
lobster
may
not
merely
be
regarded
as
modifications
of
a
common
type
in
fact
and
in
nature
they
are
so
the
leg
and
the
jaw
of
the
young
animal
being
at
first
indistinguishable
these
are
wonderful
truths
the
more
so
because
the
zoologist
finds
them
to
be
of
universal
application
the
investigation
of
a
polype
of
a
snail
of
a
fish
of
a
horse
or
of
a
man
would
have
led
us
though
by
a
less
easy
path
perhaps
to
exactly
the
same
point
unity
of
plan
everywhere
lies
hidden
under
the
mask
of
diversity
of
structure
the
complex
is
everywhere
evolved
out
of
the
simple
every
animal
has
at
first
the
form
of
an
egg
and
every
animal
and
every
organic
part
in
reaching
its
adult
state
passes
through
conditions
common
to
other
animals
and
other
adult
parts
and
this
leads
me
to
another
point
i
have
hitherto
spoken
as
if
the
lobster
were
alone
in
the
world
but
as
i
need
hardly
remind
you
there
are
myriads
of
other
animal
organisms
of
these
some
such
as
men
horses
birds
fishes
snails
slugs
oysters
corals
and
sponges
are
not
in
the
least
like
the
lobster
but
other
animals
though
they
may
differ
a
good
deal
from
the
lobster
are
yet
either
very
like
it
or
are
like
something
that
is
like
it
the
cray
fish
the
rock
lobster
and
the
prawn
and
the
shrimp
for
example
however
different
are
yet
so
like
lobsters
that
a
child
would
group
them
as
of
the
lobster
kind
in
contradistinction
to
snails
and
slugs
and
these
last
again
would
form
a
kind
by
themselves
in
contradistinction
to
cows
horses
and
sheep
the
cattle
kind
but
this
spontaneous
grouping
into
kinds
is
the
first
essay
of
the
human
mind
at
classification
or
the
calling
by
a
common
name
of
those
things
that
are
alike
and
the
arranging
them
in
such
a
manner
as
best
to
suggest
the
sum
of
their
likenesses
and
unlikenesses
to
other
things
those
kinds
which
include
no
other
subdivisions
than
the
sexes
or
various
breeds
are
called
in
technical
language
species
the
english
lobster
is
a
species
our
cray
fish
is
another
our
prawn
is
another
in
other
countries
however
there
are
lobsters
cray
fish
and
prawns
very
like
ours
and
yet
presenting
sufficient
differences
to
deserve
distinction
naturalists
therefore
express
this
resemblance
and
this
diversity
by
grouping
them
as
distinct
species
of
the
same
genus
but
the
lobster
and
the
cray
fish
though
belonging
to
distinct
genera
have
many
features
in
common
and
hence
are
grouped
together
in
an
assemblage
which
is
called
a
family
more
distant
resemblances
connect
the
lobster
with
the
prawn
and
the
crab
which
are
expressed
by
putting
all
these
into
the
same
order
again
more
remote
but
still
very
definite
resemblances
unite
the
lobster
with
the
woodlouse
the
king
crab
the
and
the
barnacle
and
separate
them
from
all
other
animals
whence
they
collectively
constitute
the
larger
group
or
class
but
the
exhibit
many
peculiar
features
in
common
with
insects
spiders
and
centipedes
so
that
these
are
grouped
into
the
still
larger
assemblage
or
province
and
finally
the
relations
which
these
have
to
worms
and
other
lower
animals
are
expressed
by
combining
the
whole
vast
aggregate
into
the
of
if
i
had
worked
my
way
from
a
sponge
instead
of
a
lobster
i
should
have
found
it
associated
by
like
ties
with
a
great
number
of
other
animals
into
the
if
i
had
selected
a
polype
or
a
coral
the
members
of
what
naturalists
term
the
would
have
grouped
themselves
around
my
type
had
a
snail
been
chosen
the
inhabitants
of
all
univalve
and
bivalve
land
and
water
shells
the
lamp
shells
the
squids
and
the
would
have
gradually
linked
themselves
on
to
it
as
members
of
the
same
of
and
finally
starting
from
man
i
should
have
been
compelled
to
admit
first
the
ape
the
rat
the
horse
the
dog
into
the
same
class
and
then
the
bird
the
crocodile
the
turtle
the
frog
and
the
fish
into
the
same
of
and
if
i
had
followed
out
all
these
various
lines
of
classification
fully
i
should
discover
in
the
end
that
there
was
no
animal
either
recent
or
fossil
which
did
not
at
once
fall
into
one
or
other
of
these
in
other
words
every
animal
is
organized
upon
one
or
other
of
the
five
or
more
plans
whose
existence
renders
our
classification
possible
and
so
definitely
and
precisely
marked
is
the
structure
of
each
animal
that
in
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
there
is
not
the
least
evidence
to
prove
that
a
form
in
the
slightest
degree
transitional
between
any
of
the
two
groups
annulosa
and
either
exists
or
has
existed
during
that
period
of
the
earth
history
which
is
recorded
by
the
geologist
nevertheless
you
must
not
for
a
moment
suppose
because
no
such
transitional
forms
are
known
that
the
members
of
the
are
disconnected
from
or
independent
of
one
another
on
the
contrary
in
their
earliest
condition
they
are
all
alike
and
the
primordial
germs
of
a
man
a
dog
a
bird
a
fish
a
beetle
a
snail
and
a
polype
are
in
no
essential
structural
respects
distinguishable
in
this
broad
sense
it
may
with
truth
be
said
that
all
living
animals
and
all
those
dead
creations
which
geology
reveals
are
bound
together
by
an
unity
of
organization
of
the
same
character
though
not
equal
in
degree
to
that
which
enables
us
to
discern
one
and
the
same
plan
amidst
the
twenty
different
segments
of
a
lobster
body
truly
it
has
been
said
that
to
a
clear
eye
the
smallest
fact
is
a
window
through
which
the
infinite
may
be
seen
turning
from
these
purely
morphological
considerations
let
us
now
examine
into
the
manner
in
which
the
attentive
study
of
the
lobster
impels
us
into
other
lines
of
research
lobsters
are
found
in
all
the
european
seas
but
on
the
opposite
shores
of
the
atlantic
and
in
the
seas
of
the
southern
hemisphere
they
do
not
exist
they
are
however
represented
in
these
regions
by
very
closely
allied
but
distinct
forms
the
and
the
so
that
we
may
say
that
the
european
has
one
species
of
the
american
another
the
african
another
and
thus
the
remarkable
facts
of
geographical
distribution
begin
to
dawn
upon
us
again
if
we
examine
the
contents
of
the
earth
crust
we
shall
find
in
the
latter
of
those
deposits
which
have
served
as
the
great
burying
grounds
of
past
ages
numberless
animals
but
none
so
similar
to
our
living
lobster
as
to
make
zoologists
sure
that
they
belonged
even
to
the
same
genus
if
we
go
still
further
back
in
time
we
discover
in
the
oldest
rocks
of
all
the
remains
of
animals
constructed
on
the
same
general
plan
as
the
lobster
and
belonging
to
the
same
great
group
of
but
for
the
most
part
totally
different
from
the
lobster
and
indeed
from
any
other
living
form
of
crustacean
and
thus
we
gain
a
notion
of
that
successive
change
of
the
animal
population
of
the
globe
in
past
ages
which
is
the
most
striking
fact
revealed
by
geology
consider
now
where
our
inquiries
have
led
us
we
studied
our
type
morphologically
when
we
determined
its
anatomy
and
its
development
and
when
comparing
it
in
these
respects
with
other
animals
we
made
out
its
place
in
a
system
of
classification
if
we
were
to
examine
every
animal
in
a
similar
manner
we
should
establish
a
complete
body
of
zoological
morphology
again
we
investigated
the
distribution
of
our
type
in
space
and
in
time
and
if
the
like
had
been
done
with
every
animal
the
sciences
of
geographical
and
geological
distribution
would
have
attained
their
limit
but
you
will
observe
one
remarkable
circumstance
that
up
to
this
point
the
question
of
the
life
of
these
organisms
has
not
come
under
consideration
morphology
and
distribution
might
be
studied
almost
as
well
if
animals
and
plants
were
a
peculiar
kind
of
crystals
and
possessed
none
of
those
functions
which
distinguish
living
beings
so
remarkably
but
the
facts
of
morphology
and
distribution
have
to
be
accounted
for
and
the
science
whose
aim
it
is
to
account
for
them
is
physiology
let
us
return
to
our
lobster
once
more
if
we
watched
the
creature
in
its
native
element
we
should
see
it
climbing
actively
the
submerged
rocks
among
which
it
delights
to
live
by
means
of
its
strong
legs
or
swimming
by
powerful
strokes
of
its
great
tail
the
appendages
of
whose
sixth
joint
are
spread
out
into
a
broad
propeller
seize
it
and
it
will
show
you
that
its
great
claws
are
no
mean
weapons
of
offence
suspend
a
piece
of
carrion
among
its
haunts
and
it
will
greedily
devour
it
tearing
and
crushing
the
flesh
by
means
of
its
multitudinous
jaws
suppose
that
we
had
known
nothing
of
the
lobster
but
as
an
inert
mass
an
organic
crystal
if
i
may
use
the
phrase
and
that
we
could
suddenly
see
it
exerting
all
these
powers
what
wonderful
new
ideas
and
new
questions
would
arise
in
our
minds
the
great
new
question
would
be
how
does
all
this
take
place
the
chief
new
idea
would
be
the
idea
of
adaptation
to
purpose
the
notion
that
the
constituents
of
animal
bodies
are
not
mere
unconnected
parts
but
organs
working
together
to
an
end
let
us
consider
the
tail
of
the
lobster
again
from
this
point
of
view
morphology
has
taught
us
that
it
is
a
series
of
segments
composed
of
homologous
parts
which
undergo
various
modifications
beneath
and
through
which
a
common
plan
of
formation
is
discernible
but
if
i
look
at
the
same
part
physiologically
i
see
that
it
is
a
most
beautifully
constructed
organ
of
locomotion
by
means
of
which
the
animal
can
swiftly
propel
itself
either
backwards
or
forwards
but
how
is
this
remarkable
propulsive
machine
made
to
perform
its
functions
if
i
were
suddenly
to
kill
one
of
these
animals
and
to
take
out
all
the
soft
parts
i
should
find
the
shell
to
be
perfectly
inert
to
have
no
more
power
of
moving
itself
than
is
possessed
by
the
machinery
of
a
mill
when
disconnected
from
its
or
but
if
i
were
to
open
it
and
take
out
the
viscera
only
leaving
the
white
flesh
i
should
perceive
that
the
lobster
could
bend
and
extend
its
tail
as
well
as
before
if
i
were
to
cut
off
the
tail
i
should
cease
to
find
any
spontaneous
motion
in
it
but
on
pinching
any
portion
of
the
flesh
i
should
observe
that
it
underwent
a
very
curious
change
each
fibre
becoming
shorter
and
thicker
by
this
act
of
contraction
as
it
is
termed
the
parts
to
which
the
ends
of
the
fibre
are
attached
are
of
course
approximated
and
according
to
the
relations
of
their
points
of
attachment
to
the
centres
of
motion
of
the
different
rings
the
bending
or
the
extension
of
the
tail
results
close
observation
of
the
newly
opened
lobster
would
soon
show
that
all
its
movements
are
due
to
the
same
cause
the
shortening
and
thickening
of
these
fleshy
fibres
which
are
technically
called
muscles
here
then
is
a
capital
fact
the
movements
of
the
lobster
are
due
to
muscular
contractility
but
why
does
a
muscle
contract
at
one
time
and
not
at
another
why
does
one
whole
group
of
muscles
contract
when
the
lobster
wishes
to
extend
his
tail
and
another
group
when
he
desires
to
bend
it
what
is
it
originates
directs
and
controls
the
motive
power
experiment
the
great
instrument
for
the
ascertainment
of
truth
in
physical
science
answers
this
question
for
us
in
the
head
of
the
lobster
there
lies
a
small
mass
of
that
peculiar
tissue
which
is
known
as
nervous
substance
cords
of
similar
matter
connect
this
brain
of
the
lobster
directly
or
indirectly
with
the
muscles
now
if
these
communicating
cords
are
cut
the
brain
remaining
entire
the
power
of
exerting
what
we
call
voluntary
motion
in
the
parts
below
the
section
is
destroyed
and
on
the
other
hand
if
the
cords
remaining
entire
the
brain
mass
be
destroyed
the
same
voluntary
mobility
is
equally
lost
whence
the
inevitable
conclusion
is
that
the
power
of
originating
these
motions
resides
in
the
brain
and
is
propagated
along
the
nervous
cords
in
the
higher
animals
the
ph√¶nomena
which
attend
this
transmission
have
been
investigated
and
the
exertion
of
the
peculiar
energy
which
resides
in
the
nerves
has
been
found
to
be
accompanied
by
a
disturbance
of
the
electrical
state
of
their
molecules
if
we
could
exactly
estimate
the
signification
of
this
disturbance
if
we
could
obtain
the
value
of
a
given
exertion
of
nerve
force
by
determining
the
quantity
of
electricity
or
of
heat
of
which
it
is
the
equivalent
if
we
could
ascertain
upon
what
arrangement
or
other
condition
of
the
molecules
of
matter
the
manifestation
of
the
nervous
and
muscular
energies
depends
and
doubtless
science
will
some
day
or
other
ascertain
these
points
physiologists
would
have
attained
their
ultimate
goal
in
this
direction
they
would
have
determined
the
relation
of
the
motive
force
of
animals
to
the
other
forms
of
force
found
in
nature
and
if
the
same
process
had
been
successfully
performed
for
all
the
operations
which
are
carried
on
in
and
by
the
animal
frame
physiology
would
be
perfect
and
the
facts
of
morphology
and
distribution
would
be
deducible
from
the
laws
which
physiologists
had
established
combined
with
those
determining
the
condition
of
the
surrounding
universe
there
is
not
a
fragment
of
the
organism
of
this
humble
animal
whose
study
would
not
lead
us
into
regions
of
thought
as
large
as
those
which
i
have
briefly
opened
up
to
you
but
what
i
have
been
saying
i
trust
has
not
only
enabled
you
to
form
a
conception
of
the
scope
and
purport
of
zoology
but
has
given
you
an
imperfect
example
of
the
manner
in
which
in
my
opinion
that
science
or
indeed
any
physical
science
may
be
best
taught
the
great
matter
is
to
make
teaching
real
and
practical
by
fixing
the
attention
of
the
student
on
particular
facts
but
at
the
same
time
it
should
be
rendered
broad
and
comprehensive
by
constant
reference
to
the
generalizations
of
which
all
particular
facts
are
illustrations
the
lobster
has
served
as
a
type
of
the
whole
animal
kingdom
and
its
anatomy
and
physiology
have
illustrated
for
us
some
of
the
greatest
truths
of
biology
the
student
who
has
once
seen
for
himself
the
facts
which
i
have
described
has
had
their
relations
explained
to
him
and
has
clearly
comprehended
them
has
so
far
a
knowledge
of
zoology
which
is
real
and
genuine
however
limited
it
may
be
and
which
is
worth
more
than
all
the
mere
reading
knowledge
of
the
science
he
could
ever
acquire
his
zoological
information
is
so
far
knowledge
and
not
mere
hearsay
and
if
it
were
my
business
to
fit
you
for
the
certificate
in
zoological
science
granted
by
this
department
i
should
pursue
a
course
precisely
similar
in
principle
to
that
which
i
have
taken
i
should
select
a
sponge
a
polype
or
a
a
mussel
a
lobster
a
fowl
as
types
of
the
five
primary
divisions
of
the
animal
kingdom
i
should
explain
their
structure
very
fully
and
show
how
each
illustrated
the
great
principles
of
zoology
having
gone
very
carefully
and
fully
over
this
ground
i
should
feel
that
you
had
a
safe
foundation
and
i
should
then
take
you
in
the
same
way
but
less
minutely
over
similarly
selected
illustrative
types
of
the
classes
and
then
i
should
direct
your
attention
to
the
special
forms
enumerated
under
the
head
of
types
in
this
syllabus
and
to
the
other
facts
there
mentioned
that
would
speaking
generally
be
my
plan
but
i
have
undertaken
to
explain
to
you
the
best
mode
of
acquiring
and
communicating
a
knowledge
of
zoology
and
you
may
therefore
fairly
ask
me
for
a
more
detailed
and
precise
account
of
the
manner
in
which
i
should
propose
to
furnish
you
with
the
information
i
refer
to
my
own
impression
is
that
the
best
model
for
all
kinds
of
training
in
physical
science
is
that
afforded
by
the
method
of
teaching
anatomy
in
use
in
the
medical
schools
this
method
consists
of
three
elements
lectures
demonstrations
and
examinations
the
object
of
lectures
is
in
the
first
place
to
awaken
the
attention
and
excite
the
enthusiasm
of
the
student
and
this
i
am
sure
may
be
effected
to
a
far
greater
extent
by
the
oral
discourse
and
by
the
personal
influence
of
a
respected
teacher
than
in
any
other
way
secondly
lectures
have
the
double
use
of
guiding
the
student
to
the
salient
points
of
a
subject
and
at
the
same
time
forcing
him
to
attend
to
the
whole
of
it
and
not
merely
to
that
part
which
takes
his
fancy
and
lastly
lectures
afford
the
student
the
opportunity
of
seeking
explanations
of
those
difficulties
which
will
and
indeed
ought
to
arise
in
the
course
of
his
studies
but
for
a
student
to
derive
the
utmost
possible
value
from
lectures
several
precautions
are
needful
i
have
a
strong
impression
that
the
better
a
discourse
is
as
an
oration
the
worse
it
is
as
a
lecture
the
flow
of
the
discourse
carries
you
on
without
proper
attention
to
its
sense
you
drop
a
word
or
a
phrase
you
lose
the
exact
meaning
for
a
moment
and
while
you
strive
to
recover
yourself
the
speaker
has
passed
on
to
something
else
the
practice
i
have
adopted
of
late
years
in
lecturing
to
students
is
to
condense
the
substance
of
the
hour
discourse
into
a
few
dry
propositions
which
are
read
slowly
and
taken
down
from
dictation
the
reading
of
each
being
followed
by
a
free
commentary
expanding
and
illustrating
the
proposition
explaining
terms
and
removing
any
difficulties
that
may
be
attackable
in
that
way
by
diagrams
made
roughly
and
seen
to
grow
under
the
lecturer
hand
in
this
manner
you
at
any
rate
insure
the
of
the
student
to
a
certain
extent
he
can
not
leave
the
entirely
empty
if
the
taking
of
notes
is
enforced
and
a
student
must
be
preternaturally
dull
and
mechanical
if
he
can
take
notes
and
hear
them
properly
explained
and
yet
learn
nothing
what
books
shall
i
read
is
a
question
constantly
put
by
the
student
to
the
teacher
my
reply
usually
is
none
write
your
notes
out
carefully
and
fully
strive
to
understand
them
thoroughly
come
to
me
for
the
explanation
of
anything
you
can
not
understand
and
i
would
rather
you
did
not
distract
your
mind
by
reading
a
properly
composed
course
of
lectures
ought
to
contain
fully
as
much
matter
as
a
student
can
assimilate
in
the
time
occupied
by
its
delivery
and
the
teacher
should
always
recollect
that
his
business
is
to
feed
and
not
to
cram
the
intellect
indeed
i
believe
that
a
student
who
gains
from
a
course
of
lectures
the
simple
habit
of
concentrating
his
attention
upon
a
definitely
limited
series
of
facts
until
they
are
thoroughly
mastered
has
made
a
step
of
immeasurable
importance
but
however
good
lectures
may
be
and
however
extensive
the
course
of
reading
by
which
they
are
followed
up
they
are
but
accessories
to
the
great
instrument
of
scientific
teaching
demonstration
if
i
insist
unweariedly
nay
fanatically
upon
the
importance
of
physical
science
as
an
educational
agent
it
is
because
the
study
of
any
branch
of
science
if
properly
conducted
appears
to
me
to
fill
up
a
void
left
by
all
other
means
of
education
i
have
the
greatest
respect
and
love
for
literature
nothing
would
grieve
me
more
than
to
see
literary
training
other
than
a
very
prominent
branch
of
education
indeed
i
wish
that
real
literary
discipline
were
far
more
attended
to
than
it
is
but
i
can
not
shut
my
eyes
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
men
who
have
had
a
purely
literary
and
those
who
have
had
a
sound
scientific
training
seeking
for
the
cause
of
this
difference
i
imagine
i
can
find
it
in
the
fact
that
in
the
world
of
letters
learning
and
knowledge
are
one
and
books
are
the
source
of
both
whereas
in
science
as
in
life
learning
and
knowledge
are
distinct
and
the
study
of
things
and
not
of
books
is
the
source
of
the
latter
all
that
literature
has
to
bestow
may
be
obtained
by
reading
and
by
practical
exercise
in
writing
and
in
speaking
but
i
do
not
exaggerate
when
i
say
that
none
of
the
best
gifts
of
science
are
to
be
won
by
these
means
on
the
contrary
the
great
benefit
which
a
scientific
education
bestows
whether
as
training
or
as
knowledge
is
dependent
upon
the
extent
to
which
the
mind
of
the
student
is
brought
into
immediate
contact
with
facts
upon
the
degree
to
which
he
learns
the
habit
of
appealing
directly
to
nature
and
of
acquiring
through
his
senses
concrete
images
of
those
properties
of
things
which
are
and
always
will
be
but
approximatively
expressed
in
human
language
our
way
of
looking
at
nature
and
of
speaking
about
her
varies
from
year
to
year
but
a
fact
once
seen
a
relation
of
cause
and
effect
once
demonstratively
apprehended
are
possessions
which
neither
change
nor
pass
away
but
on
the
contrary
form
fixed
centres
about
which
other
truths
aggregate
by
natural
affinity
therefore
the
great
business
of
the
scientific
teacher
is
to
imprint
the
fundamental
irrefragable
facts
of
his
science
not
only
by
words
upon
the
mind
but
by
sensible
impressions
upon
the
eye
and
ear
and
touch
of
the
student
in
so
complete
a
manner
that
every
term
used
or
law
enunciated
should
afterwards
call
up
vivid
images
of
the
particular
structural
or
other
facts
which
furnished
the
demonstration
of
the
law
or
the
illustration
of
the
term
now
this
important
operation
can
only
be
achieved
by
constant
demonstration
which
may
take
place
to
a
certain
imperfect
extent
during
a
lecture
but
which
ought
also
to
be
carried
on
independently
and
which
should
be
addressed
to
each
individual
student
the
teacher
endeavouring
not
so
much
to
show
a
thing
to
the
learner
as
to
make
him
see
it
for
himself
i
am
well
aware
that
there
are
great
practical
difficulties
in
the
way
of
effectual
zoological
demonstrations
the
dissection
of
animals
is
not
altogether
pleasant
and
requires
much
time
nor
is
it
easy
to
secure
an
adequate
supply
of
the
needful
specimens
the
botanist
has
here
a
great
advantage
his
specimens
are
easily
obtained
are
clean
and
wholesome
and
can
be
dissected
in
a
private
house
as
well
as
anywhere
else
and
hence
i
believe
the
fact
that
botany
is
so
much
more
readily
and
better
taught
than
its
sister
science
but
be
it
difficult
or
be
it
easy
if
zoological
science
is
to
be
properly
studied
demonstration
and
consequently
dissection
must
be
had
without
it
no
man
can
have
a
really
sound
knowledge
of
animal
organization
a
good
deal
may
be
done
however
without
actual
dissection
on
the
student
part
by
demonstration
upon
specimens
and
preparations
and
in
all
probability
it
would
not
be
very
difficult
were
the
demand
sufficient
to
organize
collections
of
such
objects
sufficient
for
all
the
purposes
of
elementary
teaching
at
a
comparatively
cheap
rate
even
without
these
much
might
be
effected
if
the
zoological
collections
which
are
open
to
the
public
were
arranged
according
to
what
has
been
termed
the
typical
principle
that
is
to
say
if
the
specimens
exposed
to
public
view
were
so
selected
that
the
public
could
learn
something
from
them
instead
of
being
as
at
present
merely
confused
by
their
multiplicity
for
example
the
grand
ornithological
gallery
at
the
british
museum
contains
between
two
and
three
thousand
species
of
birds
and
sometimes
five
or
six
specimens
of
a
species
they
are
very
pretty
to
look
at
and
some
of
the
cases
are
indeed
splendid
but
undertake
to
say
that
no
man
but
a
professed
ornithologist
has
ever
gathered
much
information
from
the
collection
certainly
no
one
of
the
tens
of
thousands
of
the
general
public
who
have
walked
through
that
gallery
ever
knew
more
about
the
essential
peculiarities
of
birds
when
he
left
the
gallery
than
when
he
entered
it
but
if
somewhere
in
that
vast
hall
there
were
a
few
preparations
exemplifying
the
leading
structural
peculiarities
and
the
mode
of
development
of
a
common
fowl
if
the
types
of
the
genera
the
leading
modifications
in
the
skeleton
in
the
plumage
at
various
ages
in
the
mode
of
nidification
and
the
like
among
birds
were
displayed
and
if
the
other
specimens
were
put
away
in
a
place
where
the
men
of
science
to
whom
they
are
alone
useful
could
have
free
access
to
them
i
can
conceive
that
this
collection
might
become
a
great
instrument
of
scientific
education
the
last
implement
of
the
teacher
to
which
i
have
adverted
is
examination
a
means
of
education
now
so
thoroughly
understood
that
i
need
hardly
enlarge
upon
it
i
hold
that
both
written
and
oral
examinations
are
indispensable
and
by
requiring
the
description
of
specimens
they
may
be
made
to
supplement
demonstration
such
is
the
fullest
reply
the
time
at
my
disposal
will
allow
me
to
give
to
the
question
how
may
a
knowledge
of
zoology
be
best
acquired
and
communicated
but
there
is
a
previous
question
which
may
be
moved
and
which
in
fact
i
know
many
are
inclined
to
move
it
is
the
question
why
should
training
masters
be
encouraged
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
this
or
any
other
branch
of
physical
science
what
is
the
use
it
is
said
of
attempting
to
make
physical
science
a
branch
of
primary
education
it
is
not
probable
that
teachers
in
pursuing
such
studies
will
be
led
astray
from
the
acquirement
of
more
important
but
less
attractive
knowledge
and
even
if
they
can
learn
something
of
science
without
prejudice
to
their
usefulness
what
is
the
good
of
their
attempting
to
instil
that
knowledge
into
boys
whose
real
business
is
the
acquisition
of
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
these
questions
are
and
will
be
very
commonly
asked
for
they
arise
from
that
profound
ignorance
of
the
value
and
true
position
of
physical
science
which
infests
the
minds
of
the
most
highly
educated
and
intelligent
classes
of
the
community
but
if
i
did
not
feel
well
assured
that
they
are
capable
of
being
easily
and
satisfactorily
answered
that
they
have
been
answered
over
and
over
again
and
that
the
time
will
come
when
men
of
liberal
education
will
blush
to
raise
such
questions
i
should
be
ashamed
of
my
position
here
without
doubt
it
is
your
great
and
very
important
function
to
carry
out
elementary
education
without
question
anything
that
should
interfere
with
the
faithful
fulfilment
of
that
duty
on
your
part
would
be
a
great
evil
and
if
i
thought
that
your
acquirement
of
the
elements
of
physical
science
and
your
communication
of
those
elements
to
your
pupils
involved
any
sort
of
interference
with
your
proper
duties
i
should
be
the
first
person
to
protest
against
your
being
encouraged
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
but
is
it
true
that
the
acquisition
of
such
a
knowledge
of
science
as
is
proposed
and
the
communication
of
that
knowledge
are
calculated
to
weaken
your
usefulness
or
may
i
not
rather
ask
is
it
possible
for
you
to
discharge
your
functions
properly
without
these
aids
what
is
the
purpose
of
primary
intellectual
education
i
apprehend
that
its
first
object
is
to
train
the
young
in
the
use
of
those
tools
wherewith
men
extract
knowledge
from
the
succession
of
phenomena
which
pass
before
their
eyes
and
that
its
second
object
is
to
inform
them
of
the
fundamental
laws
which
have
been
found
by
experience
to
govern
the
course
of
things
so
that
they
may
not
be
turned
out
into
the
world
naked
defenceless
and
a
prey
to
the
events
they
might
control
a
boy
is
taught
to
read
his
own
and
other
languages
in
order
that
he
may
have
access
to
infinitely
wider
stores
of
knowledge
than
could
ever
be
opened
to
him
by
oral
intercourse
with
his
fellow
men
he
learns
to
write
that
his
means
of
communication
with
the
rest
of
mankind
may
be
indefinitely
enlarged
and
that
he
may
record
and
store
up
the
knowledge
he
acquires
he
is
taught
elementary
mathematics
that
he
may
understand
all
those
relations
of
number
and
form
upon
which
the
transactions
of
men
associated
in
complicated
societies
are
built
and
that
he
may
have
some
practice
in
deductive
reasoning
all
these
operations
of
reading
writing
and
ciphering
are
intellectual
tools
whose
use
should
before
all
things
be
learned
and
learned
thoroughly
so
that
the
youth
may
be
enabled
to
make
his
life
that
which
it
ought
to
be
a
continual
progress
in
learning
and
in
wisdom
but
in
addition
primary
education
endeavours
to
fit
a
boy
out
with
a
certain
equipment
of
positive
knowledge
he
is
taught
the
great
laws
of
morality
the
religion
of
his
sect
so
much
history
and
geography
as
will
tell
him
where
the
great
countries
of
the
world
are
what
they
are
and
how
they
have
become
what
they
are
without
doubt
all
these
are
most
fitting
and
excellent
things
to
teach
a
boy
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
omit
any
of
them
from
any
scheme
of
primary
intellectual
education
the
system
is
excellent
so
far
as
it
goes
but
if
i
regard
it
closely
a
curious
reflection
arises
i
suppose
that
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
the
child
of
any
roman
citizen
was
taught
just
these
same
things
reading
and
writing
in
his
own
and
perhaps
the
greek
tongue
the
elements
of
mathematics
and
the
religion
morality
history
and
geography
current
in
his
time
furthermore
i
do
not
think
i
err
in
affirming
that
if
such
a
christian
roman
boy
who
had
finished
his
education
could
be
transplanted
into
one
of
our
public
schools
and
pass
through
its
course
of
instruction
he
would
not
meet
with
a
single
unfamiliar
line
of
thought
amidst
all
the
new
facts
he
would
have
to
learn
not
one
would
suggest
a
different
mode
of
regarding
the
universe
from
that
current
in
his
own
time
and
yet
surely
there
is
some
great
difference
between
the
civilization
of
the
fourth
century
and
that
of
the
nineteenth
and
still
more
between
the
intellectual
habits
and
tone
of
thought
of
that
day
and
this
and
what
has
made
this
difference
i
answer
fearlessly
the
prodigious
development
of
physical
science
within
the
last
two
centuries
modern
civilization
rests
upon
physical
science
take
away
her
gifts
to
our
own
country
and
our
position
among
the
leading
nations
of
the
world
is
gone
for
it
is
physical
science
only
that
makes
intelligence
and
moral
energy
stronger
than
brute
force
the
whole
of
modern
thought
is
steeped
in
science
it
has
made
its
way
into
the
works
of
our
best
poets
and
even
the
mere
man
of
letters
who
affects
to
ignore
and
despise
science
is
unconsciously
impregnated
with
her
spirit
and
indebted
for
his
best
products
to
her
methods
i
believe
that
the
greatest
intellectual
revolution
mankind
has
yet
seen
is
now
slowly
taking
place
by
her
agency
she
is
teaching
the
world
that
the
ultimate
court
of
appeal
is
observation
and
experiment
and
not
authority
she
is
teaching
it
to
estimate
the
value
of
evidence
she
is
creating
a
firm
and
living
faith
in
the
existence
of
immutable
moral
and
physical
laws
perfect
obedience
to
which
is
the
highest
possible
aim
of
an
intelligent
being
but
of
all
this
your
old
stereotyped
system
of
education
takes
no
note
physical
science
its
methods
its
problems
and
its
difficulties
will
meet
the
poorest
boy
at
every
turn
and
yet
we
educate
him
in
such
a
manner
that
he
shall
enter
the
world
as
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
the
methods
and
facts
of
science
as
the
day
he
was
born
the
modern
world
is
full
of
artillery
and
we
turn
out
our
children
to
do
battle
in
it
equipped
with
the
shield
and
sword
of
an
ancient
gladiator
posterity
will
cry
shame
on
us
if
we
do
not
remedy
this
deplorable
state
of
things
nay
if
we
live
twenty
years
longer
our
own
consciences
will
cry
shame
on
us
it
is
my
firm
conviction
that
the
only
way
to
remedy
it
is
to
make
the
elements
of
physical
science
an
integral
part
of
primary
education
i
have
endeavoured
to
show
you
how
that
may
be
done
for
that
branch
of
science
which
it
is
my
business
to
pursue
and
i
can
but
add
that
i
should
look
upon
the
day
when
every
schoolmaster
throughout
this
land
was
a
centre
of
genuine
however
rudimentary
scientific
knowledge
as
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
country
but
let
me
entreat
you
to
remember
my
last
words
addressing
myself
to
you
as
teachers
i
would
say
mere
book
learning
in
physical
science
is
a
sham
and
a
delusion
what
you
teach
unless
you
wish
to
be
impostors
that
you
must
first
know
and
real
knowledge
in
science
means
personal
acquaintance
with
the
facts
be
they
few
or
many
footnote
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
that
these
words
may
be
taken
to
imply
a
discouragement
on
my
part
of
any
sort
of
scientific
instruction
which
does
not
give
an
acquaintance
with
the
facts
at
first
hand
but
this
is
not
my
meaning
the
ideal
of
scientific
teaching
is
no
doubt
a
system
by
which
the
scholar
sees
every
fact
for
himself
and
the
teacher
supplies
only
the
explanations
circumstances
however
do
not
often
allow
of
the
attainment
of
that
ideal
and
we
must
put
up
with
the
next
best
system
one
in
which
the
scholar
takes
a
good
deal
on
trust
from
a
teacher
who
knowing
the
facts
by
his
own
knowledge
can
describe
them
with
so
much
vividness
as
to
enable
his
audience
to
form
competent
ideas
concerning
them
the
system
which
i
repudiate
is
that
which
allows
teachers
who
have
not
come
into
direct
contact
with
the
leading
facts
of
a
science
to
pass
their
information
on
the
scientific
virus
like
vaccine
lymph
if
passed
through
too
long
a
succession
of
organisms
will
lose
all
its
effect
in
protecting
the
young
against
the
intellectual
epidemics
to
which
they
are
exposed
vii
on
the
physical
basis
of
life
in
order
to
make
the
title
of
this
discourse
generally
intelligible
i
have
translated
the
term
protoplasm
which
is
the
scientific
name
of
the
substance
of
which
i
am
about
to
speak
by
the
words
the
physical
basis
of
life
i
suppose
that
to
many
the
idea
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
physical
basis
or
matter
of
life
may
be
novel
so
widely
spread
is
the
conception
of
life
as
a
something
which
works
through
matter
but
is
independent
of
it
and
even
those
who
are
aware
that
matter
and
life
are
inseparably
connected
may
not
be
prepared
for
the
conclusion
plainly
suggested
by
the
phrase
physical
basis
or
matter
of
life
that
there
is
some
one
kind
of
matter
which
is
common
to
all
living
beings
and
that
their
endless
diversities
are
bound
together
by
a
physical
as
well
as
an
ideal
unity
in
fact
when
first
apprehended
such
a
doctrine
as
this
appears
almost
shocking
to
common
sense
what
truly
can
seem
to
be
more
obviously
different
from
one
another
in
faculty
in
form
and
in
substance
than
the
various
kinds
of
living
beings
what
community
of
faculty
can
there
be
between
the
lichen
which
so
nearly
resembles
a
mere
mineral
incrustation
of
the
bare
rock
on
which
it
grows
and
the
painter
to
whom
it
is
instinct
with
beauty
or
the
botanist
whom
it
feeds
with
knowledge
again
think
of
the
microscopic
fungus
a
mere
infinitesimal
ovoid
particle
which
finds
space
and
duration
enough
to
multiply
into
countless
millions
in
the
body
of
a
living
fly
and
then
of
the
wealth
of
foliage
the
luxuriance
of
flower
and
fruit
which
lies
between
this
bald
sketch
of
a
plant
and
the
giant
pine
of
california
towering
to
the
dimensions
of
a
cathedral
spire
or
the
indian
fig
which
covers
acres
with
its
profound
shadow
and
endures
while
nations
and
empires
come
and
go
around
its
vast
circumference
or
turning
to
the
other
half
of
the
world
of
life
picture
to
yourselves
the
great
finner
whale
hugest
of
beasts
that
live
or
have
lived
disporting
his
eighty
or
ninety
feet
of
bone
muscle
and
blubber
with
easy
roll
among
waves
in
which
the
stoutest
ship
that
ever
left
dockyard
would
founder
hopelessly
and
contrast
him
with
the
invisible
animalcules
mere
gelatinous
specks
multitudes
of
which
could
in
fact
dance
upon
the
point
of
a
needle
with
the
same
ease
as
the
angels
of
the
schoolmen
could
in
imagination
with
these
images
before
your
minds
you
may
well
ask
what
community
of
form
or
structure
is
there
between
the
animalcule
and
the
whale
or
between
the
fungus
and
the
and
between
all
four
finally
if
we
regard
substance
or
material
composition
what
hidden
bond
can
connect
the
flower
which
a
girl
wears
in
her
hair
and
the
blood
which
courses
through
her
youthful
veins
or
what
is
there
in
common
between
the
dense
and
resisting
mass
of
the
oak
or
the
strong
fabric
of
the
tortoise
and
those
broad
disks
of
glassy
jelly
which
may
be
seen
pulsating
through
the
waters
of
a
calm
sea
but
which
drain
away
to
mere
films
in
the
hand
which
raises
them
out
of
their
element
such
objections
as
these
must
i
think
arise
in
the
mind
of
every
one
who
ponders
for
the
first
time
upon
the
conception
of
a
single
physical
basis
of
life
underlying
all
the
diversities
of
vital
existence
but
i
propose
to
demonstrate
to
you
that
notwithstanding
these
apparent
difficulties
a
threefold
unity
namely
a
unity
of
power
or
faculty
a
unity
of
form
and
a
unity
of
substantial
composition
does
pervade
the
whole
living
world
no
very
abstruse
argumentation
is
needed
in
the
first
place
to
prove
that
the
powers
or
faculties
of
all
kinds
of
living
matter
diverse
as
they
may
be
in
degree
are
substantially
similar
in
kind

has
condensed
a
survey
of
all
the
powers
of
mankind
into
the
epigram

in
physiological
language
this
means
that
all
the
multifarious
and
complicated
activities
of
man
are
comprehensible
under
three
categories
either
they
are
immediately
directed
towards
the
maintenance
and
development
of
the
body
or
they
effect
transitory
changes
in
the
relative
positions
of
parts
of
the
body
or
they
tend
towards
the
continuance
of
the
species
even
those
manifestations
of
intellect
of
feeling
and
of
will
which
we
rightly
name
the
higher
faculties
are
not
excluded
from
this
classification
inasmuch
as
to
every
one
but
the
subject
of
them
they
are
known
only
as
transitory
changes
in
the
relative
positions
of
parts
of
the
body
speech
gesture
and
every
other
form
of
human
action
are
in
the
long
run
resolvable
into
muscular
contraction
and
muscular
contraction
is
but
a
transitory
change
in
the
relative
positions
of
the
parts
of
a
muscle
but
the
scheme
which
is
large
enough
to
embrace
the
activities
of
the
highest
form
of
life
covers
all
those
of
the
lower
creatures
the
lowest
plant
or
animalcule
feeds
grows
and
reproduces
its
kind
in
addition
all
animals
manifest
those
transitory
changes
of
form
which
we
class
under
irritability
and
contractility
and
it
is
more
than
probable
that
when
the
vegetable
world
is
thoroughly
explored
we
shall
find
all
plants
in
possession
of
the
same
powers
at
one
time
or
other
of
their
existence
i
am
not
now
alluding
to
such
ph√¶nomena
at
once
rare
and
conspicuous
as
those
exhibited
by
the
leaflets
of
the
sensitive
plant
or
the
stamens
of
the
barberry
but
to
much
more
and
at
the
same
time
more
subtle
and
hidden
manifestations
of
vegetable
contractility
you
are
doubtless
aware
that
the
common
nettle
owes
its
stinging
property
to
the
innumerable
stiff
and
though
exquisitely
delicate
hairs
which
cover
its
surface
each
tapers
from
a
broad
base
to
a
slender
summit
which
though
rounded
at
the
end
is
of
such
microscopic
fineness
that
it
readily
penetrates
and
breaks
off
in
the
skin
the
whole
hair
consists
of
a
very
delicate
outer
case
of
wood
closely
applied
to
the
inner
surface
of
which
is
a
layer
of
semifluid
matter
full
of
innumerable
granules
of
extreme
minuteness
this
lining
is
protoplasm
which
thus
constitutes
a
kind
of
bag
full
of
a
limpid
liquid
and
roughly
corresponding
in
form
with
the
interior
of
the
hair
which
it
fills
when
viewed
with
a
sufficiently
high
magnifying
power
the
protoplasmic
layer
of
the
nettle
hair
is
seen
to
be
in
a
condition
of
unceasing
activity
local
contractions
of
the
whole
thickness
of
its
substance
pass
slowly
and
gradually
from
point
to
point
and
give
rise
to
the
appearance
of
progressive
waves
just
as
the
bending
of
successive
stalks
of
corn
by
a
breeze
produces
the
apparent
billows
of
a
but
in
addition
to
these
movements
and
independently
of
them
the
granules
are
driven
in
relatively
rapid
streams
through
channels
in
the
protoplasm
which
seem
to
have
a
considerable
amount
of
persistence
most
commonly
the
currents
in
adjacent
parts
of
the
protoplasm
take
similar
directions
and
thus
there
is
a
general
stream
up
one
side
of
the
hair
and
down
the
other
but
this
does
not
prevent
the
existence
of
partial
currents
which
take
different
routes
and
sometimes
trains
of
granules
may
be
seen
coursing
swiftly
in
opposite
directions
within
a
of
an
inch
of
one
another
while
occasionally
opposite
streams
come
into
direct
collision
and
after
a
longer
or
shorter
struggle
one
predominates
the
cause
of
these
currents
seems
to
lie
in
contractions
of
the
protoplasm
which
bounds
the
channels
in
which
they
flow
but
which
are
so
minute
that
the
best
microscopes
show
only
their
effects
and
not
themselves
the
spectacle
afforded
by
the
wonderful
energies
prisoned
within
the
compass
of
the
microscopic
hair
of
a
plant
which
we
commonly
regard
as
a
merely
passive
organism
is
not
easily
forgotten
by
one
who
has
watched
its
display
continued
hour
after
hour
without
pause
or
sign
of
weakening
the
possible
complexity
of
many
other
organic
forms
seemingly
as
simple
as
the
protoplasm
of
the
nettle
dawns
upon
one
and
the
comparison
of
such
a
protoplasm
to
a
body
with
an
internal
circulation
which
has
been
put
forward
by
an
eminent
physiologist
loses
much
of
its
startling
character
currents
similar
to
those
of
the
hairs
of
the
nettle
have
been
observed
in
a
great
multitude
of
very
different
plants
and
weighty
authorities
have
suggested
that
they
probably
occur
in
more
or
less
perfection
in
all
young
vegetable
cells
if
such
be
the
case
the
wonderful
noonday
silence
of
a
tropical
forest
is
after
all
due
only
to
the
dulness
of
our
hearing
and
could
our
ears
catch
the
murmur
of
these
tiny
maelstroms
as
they
whirl
in
the
innumerable
myriads
of
living
cells
which
constitute
each
tree
we
should
be
stunned
as
with
the
roar
of
a
great
city
among
the
lower
plants
it
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
that
contractility
should
be
still
more
openly
manifested
at
some
periods
of
their
existence
the
protoplasm
of
and
becomes
under
many
circumstances
partially
or
completely
freed
from
its
woody
case
and
exhibits
movements
of
its
whole
mass
or
is
propelled
by
the
contractility
of
one
or
more
prolongations
of
its
body
which
are
called
vibratile
cilia
and
so
far
as
the
conditions
of
the
manifestation
of
the
ph√¶nomena
of
contractility
have
yet
been
studied
they
are
the
same
for
the
plant
as
for
the
animal
heat
and
electric
shocks
influence
both
and
in
the
same
way
though
it
may
be
in
different
degrees
it
is
by
no
means
my
intention
to
suggest
that
there
is
no
difference
in
faculty
between
the
lowest
plant
and
the
highest
or
between
plants
and
animals
but
the
difference
between
the
powers
of
the
lowest
plant
or
animal
and
those
of
the
highest
is
one
of
degree
not
of
kind
and
depends
as
long
ago
so
well
pointed
out
upon
the
extent
to
which
the
principle
of
the
division
of
labour
is
carried
out
in
the
living
economy
in
the
lowest
organism
all
parts
are
competent
to
perform
all
functions
and
one
and
the
same
portion
of
protoplasm
may
successively
take
on
the
function
of
feeding
moving
or
reproducing
apparatus
in
the
highest
on
the
contrary
a
great
number
of
parts
combine
to
perform
each
function
each
part
doing
its
allotted
share
of
the
work
with
great
accuracy
and
efficiency
but
being
useless
for
any
other
purpose
on
the
other
hand
notwithstanding
all
the
fundamental
resemblances
which
exist
between
the
powers
of
the
protoplasm
in
plants
and
in
animals
they
present
a
striking
difference
to
which
i
shall
advert
more
at
length
presently
in
the
fact
that
plants
can
manufacture
fresh
protoplasm
out
of
mineral
compounds
whereas
animals
are
obliged
to
procure
it
ready
made
and
hence
in
the
long
run
depend
upon
plants
upon
what
condition
this
difference
in
the
powers
of
the
two
great
divisions
of
the
world
of
life
depends
nothing
is
at
present
known
with
such
qualification
as
arises
out
of
the
fact
it
may
be
truly
said
that
the
acts
of
all
living
things
are
fundamentally
one
is
any
such
unity
predicable
of
their
forms
let
us
seek
in
easily
verified
facts
for
a
reply
to
this
question
if
a
drop
of
blood
be
drawn
by
pricking
one
finger
and
viewed
with
proper
precautions
and
under
a
sufficiently
high
microscopic
power
there
will
be
seen
among
the
innumerable
multitude
of
little
circular
discoidal
bodies
or
corpuscles
which
float
in
it
and
give
it
its
colour
a
comparatively
small
number
of
colourless
corpuscles
of
somewhat
larger
size
and
very
irregular
shape
if
the
drop
of
blood
be
kept
at
the
temperature
of
the
body
these
colourless
corpuscles
will
be
seen
to
exhibit
a
marvellous
activity
changing
their
forms
with
great
rapidity
drawing
in
and
thrusting
out
prolongations
of
their
substance
and
creeping
about
as
if
they
were
independent
organisms
the
substance
which
is
thus
active
is
a
mass
of
protoplasm
and
its
activity
differs
in
detail
rather
than
in
principle
from
that
of
the
protoplasm
of
the
nettle
under
sundry
circumstances
the
corpuscle
dies
and
becomes
distended
into
a
round
mass
in
the
midst
of
which
is
seen
a
smaller
spherical
body
which
existed
but
was
more
or
less
hidden
in
the
living
corpuscle
and
is
called
its
corpuscles
of
essentially
similar
structure
are
to
be
found
in
the
skin
in
the
lining
of
the
mouth
and
scattered
through
the
whole
framework
of
the
body
nay
more
in
the
earliest
condition
of
the
human
organism
in
that
state
in
which
it
has
but
just
become
distinguishable
from
the
egg
in
which
it
arises
it
is
nothing
but
an
aggregation
of
such
corpuscles
and
every
organ
of
the
body
was
once
no
more
than
such
an
aggregation
thus
a
nucleated
mass
of
protoplasm
turns
out
to
be
what
may
be
termed
the
structural
unit
of
the
human
body
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
body
in
its
earliest
state
is
a
mere
multiple
of
such
units
and
in
its
perfect
condition
it
is
a
multiple
of
such
units
variously
modified
but
does
the
formula
which
expresses
the
essential
structural
character
of
the
highest
animal
cover
all
the
rest
as
the
statement
of
its
powers
and
faculties
covered
that
of
all
others
very
nearly
beast
and
fowl
reptile
and
fish
mollusk
worm
and
polype
are
all
composed
of
structural
units
of
the
same
character
namely
masses
of
protoplasm
with
a
nucleus
there
are
sundry
very
low
animals
each
of
which
structurally
is
a
mere
colourless
leading
an
independent
life
but
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
animal
scale
even
this
simplicity
becomes
simplified
and
all
the
ph√¶nomena
of
life
are
manifested
by
a
particle
of
protoplasm
without
a
nucleus
nor
are
such
organisms
insignificant
by
reason
of
their
want
of
complexity
it
is
a
fair
question
whether
the
protoplasm
of
those
simplest
forms
of
life
which
people
an
immense
extent
of
the
bottom
of
the
sea
would
not
outweigh
that
of
all
the
higher
living
beings
which
inhabit
the
land
put
together
and
in
ancient
times
no
less
than
at
the
present
day
such
living
beings
as
these
have
been
the
greatest
of
rock
builders
what
has
been
said
of
the
animal
world
is
no
less
true
of
plants
imbedded
in
the
protoplasm
at
the
broad
or
attached
end
of
the
nettle
hair
there
lies
a
spheroidal
nucleus
careful
examination
further
proves
that
the
whole
substance
of
the
nettle
is
made
up
of
a
repetition
of
such
masses
of
nucleated
protoplasm
each
contained
in
a
wooden
case
which
is
modified
in
form
sometimes
into
a
woody
fibre
sometimes
into
a
duct
or
spiral
vessel
sometimes
into
a
pollen
grain
or
an
ovule
traced
back
to
its
earliest
state
the
nettle
arises
as
the
man
does
in
a
particle
of
nucleated
protoplasm
and
in
the
lowest
plants
as
in
the
lowest
animals
a
single
mass
of
such
protoplasm
may
constitute
the
whole
plant
or
the
protoplasm
may
exist
without
a
nucleus
under
these
circumstances
it
may
well
be
asked
how
is
one
mass
of
protoplasm
to
be
distinguished
from
another
why
call
one
plant
and
the
other
animal
the
only
reply
is
that
so
far
as
form
is
concerned
plants
and
animals
are
not
separable
and
that
in
many
cases
it
is
a
mere
matter
of
convention
whether
we
call
a
given
organism
an
animal
or
a
plant
there
is
a
living
body
called
which
appears
upon
decaying
vegetable
substances
and
in
one
of
its
forms
is
common
upon
the
surfaces
of
in
this
condition
it
is
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
fungus
and
formerly
was
always
regarded
as
such
but
the
remarkable
investigations
of
de
bary
have
shown
that
in
another
condition
the
is
an
actively
locomotive
creature
and
takes
in
solid
matters
upon
which
apparently
it
feeds
thus
exhibiting
the
most
characteristic
feature
of
animality
is
this
a
plant
or
is
it
an
animal
is
it
both
or
is
it
neither
some
decide
in
favour
of
the
last
supposition
and
establish
an
intermediate
kingdom
a
sort
of
biological
no
man
land
for
all
these
questionable
forms
but
as
it
is
admittedly
impossible
to
draw
any
distinct
boundary
line
between
this
no
man
land
and
the
vegetable
world
on
the
one
hand
or
the
animal
on
the
other
it
appears
to
me
that
this
proceeding
merely
doubles
the
difficulty
which
before
was
single
protoplasm
simple
or
nucleated
is
the
formal
basis
of
all
life
it
is
the
clay
of
the
potter
which
bake
it
and
paint
it
as
he
will
remains
clay
separated
by
artifice
and
not
by
nature
from
the
commonest
brick
or
clod
thus
it
becomes
clear
that
all
living
powers
are
cognate
and
that
all
living
forms
are
fundamentally
of
one
character
the
researches
of
the
chemist
have
revealed
a
no
less
striking
uniformity
of
material
composition
in
living
matter
in
perfect
strictness
it
is
true
that
chemical
investigation
can
tell
us
little
or
nothing
directly
of
the
composition
of
living
matter
inasmuch
as
such
matter
must
needs
die
in
the
act
of
analysis
and
upon
this
very
obvious
ground
objections
which
i
confess
seem
to
me
to
be
somewhat
frivolous
have
been
raised
to
the
drawing
of
any
conclusions
whatever
respecting
the
composition
of
actually
living
matter
from
that
of
the
dead
matter
of
life
which
alone
is
accessible
to
us
but
objectors
of
this
class
do
not
seem
to
reflect
that
it
is
also
in
strictness
true
that
we
know
nothing
about
the
composition
of
any
body
whatever
as
it
is
the
statement
that
a
crystal
of
consists
of
carbonate
of
lime
is
quite
true
if
we
only
mean
that
by
appropriate
processes
it
may
be
resolved
into
carbonic
acid
and
quicklime
if
you
pass
the
same
carbonic
acid
over
the
very
quicklime
thus
obtained
you
will
obtain
carbonate
of
lime
again
but
it
will
not
be
nor
anything
like
it
can
it
therefore
be
said
that
chemical
analysis
teaches
nothing
about
the
chemical
composition
of
such
a
statement
would
be
absurd
but
it
is
hardly
more
so
than
the
talk
one
occasionally
hears
about
the
uselessness
of
applying
the
results
of
chemical
analysis
to
the
living
bodies
which
have
yielded
them
one
fact
at
any
rate
is
out
of
reach
of
such
refinements
and
this
is
that
all
the
forms
of
protoplasm
which
have
yet
been
examined
contain
the
four
elements
carbon
hydrogen
oxygen
and
nitrogen
in
very
complex
union
and
that
they
behave
similarly
towards
several
reagents
to
this
complex
combination
the
nature
of
which
has
never
been
determined
with
exactness
the
name
of
protein
has
been
applied
and
if
we
use
this
term
with
such
caution
as
may
properly
arise
out
of
our
comparative
ignorance
of
the
things
for
which
it
stands
it
may
be
truly
said
that
all
protoplasm
is
proteinaceous
or
as
the
white
or
albumen
of
an
egg
is
one
of
the
commonest
examples
of
a
nearly
pure
protein
matter
we
may
say
that
all
living
matter
is
more
or
less
albuminoid
perhaps
it
would
not
yet
be
safe
to
say
that
all
forms
of
protoplasm
are
affected
by
the
direct
action
of
electric
shocks
and
yet
the
number
of
cases
in
which
the
contraction
of
protoplasm
is
shown
to
be
effected
by
this
agency
increases
every
day
nor
can
it
be
affirmed
with
perfect
confidence
that
all
forms
of
protoplasm
are
liable
to
undergo
that
peculiar
coagulation
at
a
temperature
of
centigrade
which
has
been
called
though
k√ºhne
beautiful
researches
have
proved
this
occurrence
to
take
place
in
so
many
and
such
diverse
living
beings
that
it
is
hardly
rash
to
expect
that
the
law
holds
good
for
all
enough
has
perhaps
been
said
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
general
uniformity
in
the
character
of
the
protoplasm
or
physical
basis
of
life
in
whatever
group
of
living
beings
it
may
be
studied
but
it
will
be
understood
that
this
general
uniformity
by
no
means
excludes
any
amount
of
special
modifications
of
the
fundamental
substance
the
mineral
carbonate
of
lime
assumes
an
immense
diversity
of
characters
though
no
one
doubts
that
under
all
these
protean
changes
it
is
one
and
the
same
thing
and
now
what
is
the
ultimate
fate
and
what
the
origin
of
the
matter
of
life
is
it
as
some
of
the
older
naturalists
supposed
diffused
throughout
the
universe
in
molecules
which
are
indestructible
and
unchangeable
in
themselves
but
in
endless
transmigration
unite
in
innumerable
permutations
into
the
diversified
forms
of
life
we
know
or
is
the
matter
of
life
composed
of
ordinary
matter
differing
from
it
only
in
the
manner
in
which
its
atoms
are
aggregated
is
it
built
up
of
ordinary
matter
and
again
resolved
into
ordinary
matter
when
its
work
is
done
modern
science
does
not
hesitate
a
moment
between
these
alternatives
physiology
writes
over
the
portals
of
life
debemur
morti
nos
nostraque
with
a
profounder
meaning
than
the
roman
poet
attached
to
that
melancholy
line
under
whatever
disguise
it
takes
refuge
whether
fungus
or
oak
worm
or
man
the
living
protoplasm
not
only
ultimately
dies
and
is
resolved
into
its
mineral
and
lifeless
constituents
but
is
always
dying
and
strange
as
the
paradox
may
sound
could
not
live
unless
it
died
in
the
wonderful
story
of
the
peau
de
chagrin
the
hero
becomes
possessed
of
a
magical
wild
ass
skin
which
yields
him
the
means
of
gratifying
all
his
wishes
but
its
surface
represents
the
duration
of
the
proprietor
life
and
for
every
satisfied
desire
the
skin
shrinks
in
proportion
to
the
intensity
of
fruition
until
at
length
life
and
the
last
handbreadth
of
the
de
disappear
with
the
gratification
of
a
last
wish
balzac
studies
had
led
him
over
a
wide
range
of
thought
and
speculation
and
his
shadowing
forth
of
physiological
truth
in
this
strange
story
may
have
been
intentional
at
any
rate
the
matter
of
life
is
a
veritable
de
and
for
every
vital
act
it
is
somewhat
the
smaller
all
work
implies
waste
and
the
work
of
life
results
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
waste
of
protoplasm
every
word
uttered
by
a
speaker
costs
him
some
physical
loss
and
in
the
strictest
sense
he
burns
that
others
may
have
light
so
much
eloquence
so
much
of
his
body
resolved
into
carbonic
acid
water
and
urea
it
is
clear
that
this
process
of
expenditure
can
not
go
on
for
ever
but
happily
the
protoplasmic
de
differs
from
balzac
in
its
capacity
of
being
repaired
and
brought
back
to
its
full
size
after
every
exertion
for
example
this
present
lecture
whatever
its
intellectual
worth
to
you
has
a
certain
physical
value
to
me
which
is
conceivably
expressible
by
the
number
of
grains
of
protoplasm
and
other
bodily
substance
wasted
in
maintaining
my
vital
processes
during
its
delivery
my
de
will
be
distinctly
smaller
at
the
end
of
the
discourse
than
it
was
at
the
beginning
by
and
by
i
shall
probably
have
recourse
to
the
substance
commonly
called
mutton
for
the
purpose
of
stretching
it
back
to
its
original
size
now
this
mutton
was
once
the
living
protoplasm
more
or
less
modified
of
another
animal
a
sheep
as
i
shall
eat
it
it
is
the
same
matter
altered
not
only
by
death
but
by
exposure
to
sundry
artificial
operations
in
the
process
of
cooking
but
these
changes
whatever
be
their
extent
have
not
rendered
it
incompetent
to
resume
its
old
functions
as
matter
of
life
a
singular
inward
laboratory
which
i
possess
will
dissolve
a
certain
portion
of
the
modified
protoplasm
the
solution
so
formed
will
pass
into
my
veins
and
the
subtle
influences
to
which
it
will
then
be
subjected
will
convert
the
dead
protoplasm
into
living
protoplasm
and
transubstantiate
sheep
into
man
nor
is
this
all
if
digestion
were
a
thing
to
be
trifled
with
i
might
sup
upon
lobster
and
the
matter
of
life
of
the
crustacean
would
undergo
the
same
wonderful
metamorphosis
into
humanity
and
were
i
to
return
to
my
own
place
by
sea
and
undergo
shipwreck
the
crustacea
might
and
probably
would
return
the
compliment
and
demonstrate
our
common
nature
by
turning
my
protoplasm
into
living
lobster
or
if
nothing
better
were
to
be
had
i
might
supply
my
wants
with
mere
bread
and
i
should
find
the
protoplasm
of
the
to
be
convertible
into
man
with
no
more
trouble
than
that
of
the
sheep
and
with
far
less
i
fancy
than
that
of
the
lobster
hence
it
appears
to
be
a
matter
of
no
great
moment
what
animal
or
what
plant
i
lay
under
contribution
for
protoplasm
and
the
fact
speaks
volumes
for
the
general
identity
of
that
substance
in
all
living
beings
i
share
this
catholicity
of
assimilation
with
other
animals
all
of
which
so
far
as
we
know
could
thrive
equally
well
on
the
protoplasm
of
any
of
their
fellows
or
of
any
plant
but
here
the
assimilative
powers
of
the
animal
world
cease
a
solution
of
in
water
with
an
infinitesimal
proportion
of
some
other
saline
matters
contains
all
the
elementary
bodies
which
enter
into
the
composition
of
protoplasm
but
as
i
need
hardly
say
a
hogshead
of
that
fluid
would
not
keep
a
hungry
man
from
starving
nor
would
it
save
any
animal
whatever
from
a
like
fate
an
animal
can
not
make
protoplasm
but
must
take
it
from
some
other
animal
or
some
plant
the
animal
highest
feat
of
constructive
chemistry
being
to
convert
dead
protoplasm
into
that
living
matter
of
life
which
is
appropriate
to
itself
therefore
in
seeking
for
the
origin
of
protoplasm
we
must
eventually
turn
to
the
vegetable
world
the
fluid
containing
carbonic
acid
water
and
ammonia
which
offers
such
a
barmecide
feast
to
the
animal
is
a
table
richly
spread
to
multitudes
of
plants
and
with
a
due
supply
of
only
such
materials
many
a
plant
will
not
only
maintain
itself
in
vigour
but
grow
and
multiply
until
it
has
increased
a
or
a
million
the
quantity
of
protoplasm
which
it
originally
possessed
in
this
way
building
up
the
matter
of
life
to
an
indefinite
extent
from
the
common
matter
of
the
universe
thus
the
animal
can
only
raise
the
complex
substance
of
dead
protoplasm
to
the
higher
power
as
one
may
say
of
living
protoplasm
while
the
plant
can
raise
the
less
complex
substances
carbonic
acid
water
and
ammonia
to
the
same
stage
of
living
protoplasm
if
not
to
the
same
level
but
the
plant
also
has
its
limitations
some
of
the
fungi
for
example
appear
to
need
higher
compounds
to
start
with
and
no
known
plant
can
live
upon
the
uncompounded
elements
of
protoplasm
a
plant
supplied
with
pure
carbon
hydrogen
oxygen
and
nitrogen
phosphorus
sulphur
and
the
like
would
as
infallibly
die
as
the
animal
in
his
bath
of
though
it
would
be
surrounded
by
all
the
constituents
of
protoplasm
nor
indeed
need
the
process
of
simplification
of
vegetable
food
be
carried
so
far
as
this
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
limit
of
the
plant
thaumaturgy
let
water
carbonic
acid
and
all
the
other
needful
constituents
be
supplied
with
ammonia
and
an
ordinary
plant
will
still
be
unable
to
manufacture
protoplasm
thus
the
matter
of
life
so
far
as
we
know
it
and
we
have
no
right
to
speculate
on
any
other
breaks
up
in
consequence
of
that
continual
death
which
is
the
condition
of
its
manifesting
vitality
into
carbonic
acid
water
and
ammonia
which
certainly
possess
no
properties
but
those
of
ordinary
matter
and
out
of
these
same
forms
of
ordinary
matter
and
from
none
which
are
simpler
the
vegetable
world
builds
up
all
the
protoplasm
which
keeps
the
animal
world
a
going
plants
are
the
accumulators
of
the
power
which
animals
distribute
and
disperse
but
it
will
be
observed
that
the
existence
of
the
matter
of
life
depends
on
the
of
certain
compounds
namely
carbonic
acid
water
and
ammonia
withdraw
any
one
of
these
three
from
the
world
and
all
vital
ph√¶nomena
come
to
an
end
they
are
related
to
the
protoplasm
of
the
plant
as
the
protoplasm
of
the
plant
is
to
that
of
the
animal
carbon
hydrogen
oxygen
and
nitrogen
are
all
lifeless
bodies
of
these
carbon
and
oxygen
unite
in
certain
proportions
and
under
certain
conditions
to
give
rise
to
carbonic
acid
hydrogen
and
oxygen
produce
water
nitrogen
and
hydrogen
give
rise
to
ammonia
these
new
compounds
like
the
elementary
bodies
of
which
they
are
composed
are
lifeless
but
when
they
are
brought
together
under
certain
conditions
they
give
rise
to
the
still
more
complex
body
protoplasm
and
this
protoplasm
exhibits
the
phenomena
of
life
i
see
no
break
in
this
series
of
steps
in
molecular
complication
and
i
am
unable
to
understand
why
the
language
which
is
applicable
to
any
one
term
of
the
series
may
not
be
used
to
any
of
the
others
we
think
fit
to
call
different
kinds
of
matter
carbon
oxygen
hydrogen
and
nitrogen
and
to
speak
of
the
various
powers
and
activities
of
these
substances
as
the
properties
of
the
matter
of
which
they
are
composed
when
hydrogen
and
oxygen
are
mixed
in
a
certain
proportion
and
an
electric
spark
is
passed
through
them
they
disappear
and
a
quantity
of
water
equal
in
weight
to
the
sum
of
their
weights
appears
in
their
place
there
is
not
the
slightest
parity
between
the
passive
and
active
powers
of
the
water
and
those
of
the
oxygen
and
hydrogen
which
have
given
rise
to
it
at
fahrenheit
and
far
below
that
temperature
oxygen
and
hydrogen
are
elastic
gaseous
bodies
whose
particles
tend
to
rush
away
from
one
another
with
great
force
water
at
the
same
temperature
is
a
strong
though
brittle
solid
whose
particles
tend
to
cohere
into
definite
geometrical
shapes
and
sometimes
build
up
frosty
imitations
of
the
most
complex
forms
of
vegetable
foliage
nevertheless
we
call
these
and
many
other
strange
ph√¶nomena
the
properties
of
the
water
and
we
do
not
hesitate
to
believe
that
in
some
way
or
another
they
result
from
the
properties
of
the
component
elements
of
the
water
we
do
not
assume
that
a
something
called
aquosity
entered
into
and
took
possession
of
the
oxide
of
hydrogen
as
soon
as
it
was
formed
and
then
guided
the
aqueous
particles
to
their
places
in
the
facets
of
the
crystal
or
amongst
the
leaflets
of
the
on
the
contrary
we
live
in
the
hope
and
in
the
faith
that
by
the
advance
of
molecular
physics
we
shall
by
and
by
be
able
to
see
our
way
as
clearly
from
the
constituents
of
water
to
the
properties
of
water
as
we
are
now
able
to
deduce
the
operations
of
a
watch
from
the
form
of
its
parts
and
the
manner
in
which
they
are
put
together
is
the
case
in
any
way
changed
when
carbonic
acid
water
and
ammonia
disappear
and
in
their
place
under
the
influence
of
living
protoplasm
an
equivalent
weight
of
the
matter
of
life
makes
its
appearance
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
sort
of
parity
between
the
properties
of
the
components
and
the
properties
of
the
resultant
but
neither
was
there
in
the
case
of
the
water
it
is
also
true
that
what
i
have
spoken
of
as
the
influence
of
living
matter
is
something
quite
unintelligible
but
does
anybody
quite
comprehend
the
of
an
electric
spark
which
traverses
a
mixture
of
oxygen
and
hydrogen
what
justification
is
there
then
for
the
assumption
of
the
existence
in
the
living
matter
of
a
something
which
has
no
representative
or
correlative
in
the
not
living
matter
which
gave
rise
to
it
what
better
philosophical
status
has
vitality
than
aquosity
and
why
should
vitality
hope
for
a
better
fate
than
the
other
itys
which
have
disappeared
since
martinus
scriblerus
accounted
for
the
operation
of
the
by
its
inherent
meat
roasting
quality
and
scorned
the
materialism
of
those
who
explained
the
turning
of
the
spit
by
a
certain
mechanism
worked
by
the
draught
of
the
chimney
if
scientific
language
is
to
possess
a
definite
and
constant
signification
whenever
it
is
employed
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
logically
bound
to
apply
to
the
protoplasm
or
physical
basis
of
life
the
same
conceptions
as
those
which
are
held
to
be
legitimate
elsewhere
if
the
ph√¶nomena
exhibited
by
water
are
its
properties
so
are
those
presented
by
protoplasm
living
or
dead
its
properties
if
the
properties
of
water
may
be
properly
said
to
result
from
the
nature
and
disposition
of
its
component
molecules
i
can
find
no
intelligible
ground
for
refusing
to
say
that
the
properties
of
protoplasm
result
from
the
nature
and
disposition
of
its
molecules
but
i
bid
you
beware
that
in
accepting
these
conclusions
you
are
placing
your
feet
on
the
first
rung
of
a
ladder
which
in
most
estimation
is
the
reverse
of
jacob
and
leads
to
the
antipodes
of
heaven
it
may
seem
a
small
thing
to
admit
that
the
dull
vital
actions
of
a
fungus
or
a
foraminifer
are
the
properties
of
their
protoplasm
and
are
the
direct
results
of
the
nature
of
the
matter
of
which
they
are
composed
but
if
as
i
have
endeavoured
to
prove
to
you
their
protoplasm
is
essentially
identical
with
and
most
readily
converted
into
that
of
any
animal
i
can
discover
no
logical
between
the
admission
that
such
is
the
case
and
the
further
concession
that
all
vital
action
may
with
equal
propriety
be
said
to
be
the
result
of
the
molecular
forces
of
the
protoplasm
which
displays
it
and
if
so
it
must
be
true
in
the
same
sense
and
to
the
same
extent
that
the
thoughts
to
which
i
am
now
giving
utterance
and
your
thoughts
regarding
them
are
the
expression
of
molecular
changes
in
that
matter
of
life
which
is
the
source
of
our
other
vital
ph√¶nomena
past
experience
leads
me
to
be
tolerably
certain
that
when
the
propositions
i
have
just
placed
before
you
are
accessible
to
public
comment
and
criticism
they
will
be
condemned
by
many
zealous
persons
and
perhaps
by
some
few
of
the
wise
and
thoughtful
i
should
not
wonder
if
gross
and
brutal
materialism
were
the
mildest
phrase
applied
to
them
in
certain
quarters
and
most
undoubtedly
the
terms
of
the
propositions
are
distinctly
materialistic
nevertheless
two
things
are
certain
the
one
that
i
hold
the
statements
to
be
substantially
true
the
other
that
i
individually
am
no
materialist
but
on
the
contrary
believe
materialism
to
involve
grave
philosophical
error
this
union
of
materialistic
terminology
with
the
repudiation
of
materialistic
philosophy
i
share
with
some
of
the
most
thoughtful
men
with
whom
i
am
acquainted
and
when
i
first
undertook
to
deliver
the
present
discourse
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
fitting
opportunity
to
explain
how
such
a
union
is
not
only
consistent
with
but
necessitated
by
sound
logic
i
purposed
to
lead
you
through
the
territory
of
vital
phenomena
to
the
materialistic
slough
in
which
you
find
yourselves
now
plunged
and
then
to
point
out
to
you
the
sole
path
by
which
in
my
judgment
extrication
is
possible
an
occurrence
of
which
i
was
unaware
until
my
arrival
here
last
night
renders
this
line
of
argument
singularly
opportune
i
found
in
your
papers
the
eloquent
address
on
the
limits
of
philosophical
inquiry
which
a
distinguished
prelate
of
the
english
church
delivered
before
the
members
of
the
philosophical
institution
on
the
previous
day
my
argument
also
turns
upon
this
very
point
of
the
limits
of
philosophical
inquiry
and
i
can
not
bring
out
my
own
views
better
than
by
contrasting
them
with
those
so
plainly
and
in
the
main
fairly
stated
by
the
archbishop
of
york
but
i
may
be
permitted
to
make
a
preliminary
comment
upon
an
occurrence
that
greatly
astonished
me
applying
the
name
of
the
new
philosophy
to
that
estimate
of
the
limits
of
philosophical
inquiry
which
i
in
common
with
many
other
men
of
science
hold
to
be
just
the
archbishop
opens
his
address
by
identifying
this
new
philosophy
with
the
positive
philosophy
of
comte
of
whom
he
speaks
as
its
founder
and
then
proceeds
to
attack
that
philosopher
and
his
doctrines
vigorously
now
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
most
reverend
prelate
might
dialectically
hew
comte
in
pieces
as
a
modern
agag
and
i
should
not
attempt
to
stay
his
hand
in
so
far
as
my
study
of
what
specially
characterises
the
positive
philosophy
has
led
me
i
find
therein
little
or
nothing
of
any
scientific
value
and
a
great
deal
which
is
as
thoroughly
antagonistic
to
the
very
essence
of
science
as
anything
in
ultramontane
catholicism
in
fact
comte
philosophy
in
practice
might
be
compendiously
described
as
catholicism
christianity
but
what
has
comtism
to
do
with
the
new
philosophy
as
the
archbishop
defines
it
in
the
following
passage
let
me
briefly
remind
you
of
the
leading
principles
of
this
new
philosophy
all
knowledge
is
experience
of
facts
acquired
by
the
senses
the
traditions
of
older
philosophies
have
obscured
our
experience
by
mixing
with
it
much
that
the
senses
can
not
observe
and
until
these
additions
are
discarded
our
knowledge
is
impure
thus
metaphysics
tell
us
that
one
fact
which
we
observe
is
a
cause
and
another
is
the
effect
of
that
cause
but
upon
a
rigid
analysis
we
find
that
our
senses
observe
nothing
of
cause
or
effect
they
observe
first
that
one
fact
succeeds
another
and
after
some
opportunity
that
this
fact
has
never
failed
to
follow
that
for
cause
and
effect
we
should
substitute
invariable
succession
an
older
philosophy
teaches
us
to
define
an
object
by
distinguishing
its
essential
from
its
accidental
qualities
but
experience
knows
nothing
of
essential
and
accidental
she
sees
only
that
certain
marks
attach
to
an
object
and
after
many
observations
that
some
of
them
attach
invariably
whilst
others
may
at
times
be
absent
as
all
knowledge
is
relative
the
notion
of
anything
being
necessary
must
be
banished
with
other
traditions
there
is
much
here
that
expresses
the
spirit
of
the
new
philosophy
if
by
that
term
be
meant
the
spirit
of
modern
science
but
i
can
not
but
marvel
that
the
assembled
wisdom
and
learning
of
edinburgh
should
have
uttered
no
sign
of
dissent
when
comte
was
declared
to
be
the
founder
of
these
doctrines
no
one
will
accuse
scotchmen
of
habitually
forgetting
their
great
countrymen
but
it
was
enough
to
make
david
hume
turn
in
his
grave
that
here
almost
within
earshot
of
his
house
an
instructed
audience
should
have
listened
without
a
murmur
while
his
most
characteristic
doctrines
were
attributed
to
a
french
writer
of
fifty
years
later
date
in
whose
dreary
and
verbose
pages
we
miss
alike
the
vigour
of
thought
and
the
exquisite
clearness
of
style
of
the
man
whom
i
make
bold
to
term
the
most
acute
thinker
of
the
eighteenth
century
even
though
that
century
produced
kant
but
i
did
not
come
to
scotland
to
vindicate
the
honour
of
one
of
the
greatest
men
she
has
ever
produced
my
business
is
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
only
way
of
escape
out
of
the
crass
materialism
in
which
we
just
now
landed
is
the
adoption
and
strict
of
the
very
principles
which
the
archbishop
holds
up
to
reprobation
let
us
suppose
that
knowledge
is
absolute
and
not
relative
and
therefore
that
our
conception
of
matter
represents
that
which
it
really
is
let
us
suppose
further
that
we
do
know
more
of
cause
and
effect
than
a
certain
definite
order
of
succession
among
facts
and
that
we
have
a
knowledge
of
the
necessity
of
that
succession
and
hence
of
necessary
laws
and
i
for
my
part
do
not
see
what
escape
there
is
from
utter
materialism
and
necessarianism
for
it
is
obvious
that
our
knowledge
of
what
we
call
the
material
world
is
to
begin
with
at
least
as
certain
and
definite
as
that
of
the
spiritual
world
and
that
our
acquaintance
with
law
is
of
as
old
a
date
as
our
knowledge
of
spontaneity
further
i
take
it
to
be
demonstrable
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
prove
that
anything
whatever
may
not
be
the
effect
of
a
material
and
necessary
cause
and
that
human
logic
is
equally
incompetent
to
prove
that
any
act
is
really
spontaneous
a
really
spontaneous
act
is
one
which
by
the
assumption
has
no
cause
and
the
attempt
to
prove
such
a
negative
as
this
is
on
the
face
of
the
matter
absurd
and
while
it
is
thus
a
philosophical
impossibility
to
demonstrate
that
any
given
ph√¶nomenon
is
not
the
effect
of
a
material
cause
any
one
who
is
acquainted
with
the
history
of
science
will
admit
that
its
progress
has
in
all
ages
meant
and
now
more
than
ever
means
the
extension
of
the
province
of
what
we
call
matter
and
causation
and
the
concomitant
gradual
banishment
from
all
regions
of
human
thought
of
what
we
call
spirit
and
spontaneity
i
have
endeavoured
in
the
first
part
of
this
discourse
to
give
you
a
conception
of
the
direction
towards
which
modern
physiology
is
tending
and
i
ask
you
what
is
the
difference
between
the
conception
of
life
as
the
product
of
a
certain
disposition
of
material
molecules
and
the
old
notion
of
an
arch√¶us
governing
and
directing
blind
matter
within
each
living
body
except
this
that
here
as
elsewhere
matter
and
law
have
devoured
spirit
and
spontaneity
and
as
surely
as
every
future
grows
out
of
past
and
present
so
will
the
physiology
of
the
future
gradually
extend
the
realm
of
matter
and
law
until
it
is
with
knowledge
with
feeling
and
with
action
the
consciousness
of
this
great
truth
weighs
like
a
nightmare
i
believe
upon
many
of
the
best
minds
of
these
days
they
watch
what
they
conceive
to
be
the
progress
of
materialism
in
such
fear
and
powerless
anger
as
a
savage
feels
when
during
an
eclipse
the
great
shadow
creeps
over
the
face
of
the
sun
the
advancing
tide
of
matter
threatens
to
drown
their
souls
the
tightening
grasp
of
law
impedes
their
freedom
they
are
alarmed
lest
man
moral
nature
be
debased
by
the
increase
of
his
wisdom
if
the
new
philosophy
be
worthy
of
the
reprobation
with
which
it
is
visited
i
confess
their
fears
seem
to
me
to
be
well
founded
while
on
the
contrary
could
david
hume
be
consulted
i
think
he
would
smile
at
their
perplexities
and
chide
them
for
doing
even
as
the
heathen
and
falling
down
in
terror
before
the
hideous
idols
their
own
hands
have
raised
for
after
all
what
do
we
know
of
this
terrible
matter
except
as
a
name
for
the
unknown
and
hypothetical
cause
of
states
of
our
own
consciousness
and
what
do
we
know
of
that
spirit
over
whose
threatened
extinction
by
matter
a
great
lamentation
is
arising
like
that
which
was
heard
at
the
death
of
pan
except
that
it
is
also
a
name
for
an
unknown
and
hypothetical
cause
or
condition
of
states
of
consciousness
in
other
words
matter
and
spirit
are
but
names
for
the
imaginary
substrata
of
groups
of
natural
ph√¶nomena
and
what
is
the
dire
necessity
and
iron
law
under
which
men
groan
truly
most
gratuitously
invented
bugbears
i
suppose
if
there
be
an
iron
law
it
is
that
of
gravitation
and
if
there
be
a
physical
necessity
it
is
that
a
stone
unsupported
must
fall
to
the
ground
but
what
is
all
we
really
know
and
can
know
about
the
latter
ph√¶nomenon
simply
that
in
all
human
experience
stones
have
fallen
to
the
ground
under
these
conditions
that
we
have
not
the
smallest
reason
for
believing
that
any
stone
so
circumstanced
will
not
fall
to
the
ground
and
that
we
have
on
the
contrary
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
will
so
fall
it
is
very
convenient
to
indicate
that
all
the
conditions
of
belief
have
been
fulfilled
in
this
case
by
calling
the
statement
that
unsupported
stones
will
fall
to
the
ground
a
law
of
nature
but
when
as
commonly
happens
we
change
into
we
introduce
an
idea
of
necessity
which
most
assuredly
does
not
lie
in
the
observed
facts
and
has
no
warranty
that
i
can
discover
elsewhere
for
my
part
i
utterly
repudiate
and
anathematize
the
intruder
fact
i
know
and
law
i
know
but
what
is
this
necessity
save
an
empty
shadow
of
my
own
throwing
but
if
it
is
certain
that
we
can
have
no
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
either
matter
or
spirit
and
that
the
notion
of
necessity
is
something
illegitimately
thrust
into
the
perfectly
legitimate
conception
of
law
the
materialistic
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
but
matter
force
and
necessity
is
as
utterly
devoid
of
justification
as
the
most
baseless
of
theological
dogmas
the
fundamental
doctrines
of
materialism
like
those
of
spiritualism
and
most
other
isms
lie
outside
the
limits
of
philosophical
inquiry
and
david
hume
great
service
to
humanity
is
his
irrefragable
demonstration
of
what
these
limits
are
hume
called
himself
a
sceptic
and
therefore
others
can
not
be
blamed
if
they
apply
the
same
title
to
him
but
that
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
the
name
with
its
existing
implications
does
him
gross
injustice
if
a
man
asks
me
what
the
politics
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
are
and
i
reply
that
i
do
not
know
that
neither
i
nor
any
one
else
have
any
means
of
knowing
and
that
under
these
circumstances
i
decline
to
trouble
myself
about
the
subject
at
all
i
do
not
think
he
has
any
right
to
call
me
a
sceptic
on
the
contrary
in
replying
thus
i
conceive
that
i
am
simply
honest
and
truthful
and
show
a
proper
regard
for
the
economy
of
time
so
hume
strong
and
subtle
intellect
takes
up
a
great
many
problems
about
which
we
are
naturally
curious
and
shows
us
that
they
are
essentially
questions
of
lunar
politics
in
their
essence
incapable
of
being
answered
and
therefore
not
worth
the
attention
of
men
who
have
work
to
do
in
the
world
and
he
thus
ends
one
of
his
essays
if
we
take
in
hand
any
volume
of
divinity
or
school
metaphysics
for
instance
let
us
ask
it
contain
any
abstract
reasoning
concerning
quantity
or
no
it
contain
any
experimental
reasoning
concerning
matter
of
fact
and
no
commit
it
then
to
the
flames
for
it
can
contain
nothing
but
sophistry
and
illusion
permit
me
to
enforce
this
most
wise
advice
why
trouble
ourselves
about
matters
of
which
however
important
they
may
be
we
do
know
nothing
and
can
know
nothing
we
live
in
a
world
which
is
full
of
misery
and
ignorance
and
the
plain
duty
of
each
and
all
of
us
is
to
try
to
make
the
little
corner
he
can
influence
somewhat
less
miserable
and
somewhat
less
ignorant
than
it
was
before
he
entered
it
to
do
this
effectually
it
is
necessary
to
be
fully
possessed
of
only
two
beliefs
the
first
that
the
order
of
nature
is
ascertainable
by
our
faculties
to
an
extent
which
is
practically
unlimited
the
second
that
our
volition
counts
for
something
as
a
condition
of
the
course
of
events
each
of
these
beliefs
can
be
verified
experimentally
as
often
as
we
like
to
try
each
therefore
stands
upon
the
strongest
foundation
upon
which
any
belief
can
rest
and
forms
one
of
our
highest
truths
if
we
find
that
the
ascertainment
of
the
order
of
nature
is
facilitated
by
using
one
terminology
or
one
set
of
symbols
rather
than
another
it
is
our
clear
duty
to
use
the
former
and
no
harm
can
accrue
so
long
as
we
bear
in
mind
that
we
are
dealing
merely
with
terms
and
symbols
in
itself
it
is
of
little
moment
whether
we
express
the
ph√¶nomena
of
matter
in
terms
of
spirit
or
the
ph√¶nomena
of
spirit
in
terms
of
matter
matter
may
be
regarded
as
a
form
of
thought
thought
may
be
regarded
as
a
property
of
matter
each
statement
has
a
certain
relative
truth
but
with
a
view
to
the
progress
of
science
the
materialistic
terminology
is
in
every
way
to
be
preferred
for
it
connects
thought
with
the
other
ph√¶nomena
of
the
universe
and
suggests
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
those
physical
conditions
or
concomitants
of
thought
which
are
more
or
less
accessible
to
us
and
a
knowledge
of
which
may
in
future
help
us
to
exercise
the
same
kind
of
control
over
the
world
of
thought
as
we
already
possess
in
respect
of
the
material
world
whereas
the
alternative
or
spiritualistic
terminology
is
utterly
barren
and
leads
to
nothing
but
obscurity
and
confusion
of
ideas
thus
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
further
science
advances
the
more
extensively
and
consistently
will
all
the
ph√¶nomena
of
nature
be
represented
by
materialistic
formul√¶
and
symbols
but
the
man
of
science
who
forgetting
the
limits
of
philosophical
inquiry
slides
from
these
formul√¶
and
symbols
into
what
is
commonly
understood
by
materialism
seems
to
me
to
place
himself
on
a
level
with
the
mathematician
who
should
mistake
the
and
with
which
he
works
his
problems
for
real
entities
and
with
this
further
disadvantage
as
compared
with
the
mathematician
that
the
blunders
of
the
latter
are
of
no
practical
consequence
while
the
errors
of
systematic
materialism
may
paralyse
the
energies
and
destroy
the
beauty
of
a
life

is

some
sixteen

of

i
was
led
to
study
these
works
partly
by
the
allusions
to
them
in
logic
partly
by
the
recommendation
of
a
distinguished
theologian
and
partly
by
the
urgency
of
a
valued
friend
the
late
professor
henfrey
who
looked
upon

bulky

as
a
mine
of
wisdom

lent
them
to
me
that
i
might
dig
and
be
rich
after
due
perusal
i
found
myself
in
a
position
to
echo
my
friend
words

i
may
have
laid
more

mine
than
on
the
wisdom
for
i
found
the
veins
of
ore
few
and
far
between
and
the
rock
so
apt
to
run
to
mud
that
one
incurred
the
risk
of
being
intellectually
smothered
in
the
working
still
as
i
was
glad
to
acknowledge
i
did
come
to
a
nugget
here
and
there
though
not
so
far
as
my
experience
went
in
the
discussions
on
the
philosophy
of
the
physical
sciences
but
in
the
chapters
on
speculative
and
practical
sociology
in
these
there
was
indeed
much
to
arouse
the
liveliest
interest
in
one
whose
boat
had
broken
away
from
the
old
moorings
and
who
had
been
content
to
lay
out
an
anchor
by
the
stern
until
daylight
should
break
and
the
fog
clear
nothing
could
be
more
interesting
to
a
student
of
biology
than
to
see
the
study
of
the
biological
sciences
laid
down
as
an
essential
part
of
the
prolegomena
of
a
new
view
of
social
phenomena
nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
to
a
worshipper
of
the
severe
truthfulness
of
science
than
the
attempt
to
dispense
with
all
beliefs
save
such
as
could
brave
the
light
and
seek
rather
than
fear
criticism
while
to
a
lover
of
courage
and
outspokenness
nothing
could
be
more
touching
than
the
placid
announcement
on
the
of
the
discours
sur
du
positivisme
that
its
author
proposed
r√©organiser
sans
dieu
ni
roi
par
le
culte
syst√©matique
de
the
shattered
frame
of
modern
society
in
those
days
i
knew
my
faust
pretty
well
and
after
reading
this
word
of
might
i
was
minded
to
chant
the
stanzas
of
the
geisterchor
weh

great
however
was
my
perplexity
not
to
say
disappointment
as
i
followed
the
progress
of
this
mighty
son
of
earth
in
his
work
of
reconstruction
undoubtedly
dieu
disappeared
but
the
nouveau
supr√™me
a
gigantic
fetish
turned
out
by
comte
own
hands
reigned
in
his
stead
roi
also
was
not
heard
of
but
in
his
place
i
found
a
social
organization
which
if
it
ever
came
into
practice
would
exert
a
despotic
authority
such
as
no
sultan
has
rivalled
and
no
puritan
presbytery
in
its
palmiest
days
could
hope
to
excel
while
as
for
the
culte
syst√©matique
de
i
in
my
blindness
could
not
distinguish
it
from
sheer
popery
with
comte
in
the
chair
of
peter
and
the
names
of
most
of
the
saints
changed
to
quote
faust
again
i
found
myself
saying
with
gretchen
ungef√§hr
sagt
das
der
pfarrer
auch
nur
mit
ein
bischen
andern
worten
rightly
or
wrongly
this
was
the
impression
which
all
those
years
ago
the
study
of
comte
works
left
on
my
mind
combined
with
the
conviction
which
i
shall
always
be
thankful
to
him
for
awakening
in
me
that
the
organization
of
society
upon
a
new
and
purely
scientific
basis
is
not
only
practicable
but
is
the
only
political
object
much
worth
fighting
for
as
i
have
said
that
part
of
comte
writings
which
deals
with
the
philosophy
of
physical
science
appeared
to
me
to
possess
singularly
little
value
and
to
show
that
he
had
but
the
most
superficial
and
merely
knowledge
of
most
branches
of
what
is
usually
understood
by
science
i
do
not
mean
by
this
merely
to
say
that
comte
was
behind
our
present
knowledge
or
that
he
was
unacquainted
with
the
details
of
the
science
of
his
own
day
no
one
could
justly
make
such
defects
cause
of
complaint
in
a
philosophical
writer
of
the
past
generation
what
struck
me
was
his
want
of
apprehension
of
the
great
features
of
science
his
strange
mistakes
as
to
the
merits
of
his
scientific
contemporaries
and
his
ludicrously
erroneous
notions
about
the
part
which
some
of
the
scientific
doctrines
current
in
his
time
were
destined
to
play
in
the
future
with
these
impressions
in
my
mind
no
one
will
be
surprised
if
i
acknowledge
that
for
these
sixteen
years
it
has
been
a
periodical
source
of
irritation
to
me
to
find
comte
put
forward
as
a
representative
of
scientific
thought
and
to
observe
that
writers
whose
philosophy
had
its
legitimate
parent
in
hume
or
in
themselves
were
labelled
comtists
or
positivists
by
public
writers
even
in
spite
of
vehement
protests
to
the
contrary
it
has
cost
mill
hard
rubbings
to
get
that
label
off
and
i
watch
spencer
as
one
regards
a
good
man
struggling
with
adversity
still
engaged
in
eluding
its
adhesiveness
and
ready
to
tear
away
skin
and
all
rather
than
let
it
stick
my
own
turn
might
come
next
and
therefore
when
an
eminent
prelate
the
other
day
gave
currency
and
authority
to
the
popular
confusion
i
took
an
opportunity
of
incidentally
revindicating
property
in
the
new
philosophy
and
at
the
same
time
of
repudiating
comtism
on
my
own
behalf
the
few
lines
devoted
to
comtism
in
my
paper
on
the
physical
basis
of
life
were
in
intention
strictly
limited
to
these
two
purposes
but
they
seem
to
have
given
more
umbrage
than
i
intended
they
should
to
the
followers
of
comte
in
this
country
for
some
of
whom
let
me
observe
in
passing
i
entertain
a
most
unfeigned
respect
and
recent
article
gives
expression
to
the
displeasure
which
i
have
excited
among
the
members
of
the
comtian
body
congreve
in
a
peroration
which
seems
especially
intended
to
catch
the
attention
of
his
readers
indignantly
challenges
me
to
admire
comte
life
to
deny
that
it
has
a
marked
character
of
grandeur
about
it
and
he
uses
some
very
strong
language
because
i
show
no
sign
of
veneration
for
his
idol
i
confess
i
do
not
care
to
occupy
myself
with
the
denigration
of
a
man
who
on
the
whole
deserves
to
be
spoken
of
with
respect
therefore
i
shall
enter
into
no
statement
of
the
reasons
which
lead
me
unhesitatingly
to
accept
congreve
challenge
and
to
refuse
to
recognise
anything
which
deserves
the
name
of
grandeur
of
character
in
comte
unless
it
be
his
arrogance
which
is
undoubtedly
sublime
all
i
have
to
observe
is
that
if
congreve
is
justified
in
saying
that
i
speak
with
a
tinge
of
contempt
for
his
spiritual
father
the
reason
for
such
colouring
of
my
language
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
when
i
wrote
i
had
but
just
arisen
from
the
perusal
of
a
work
with
which
he
is
doubtless
well
acquainted
littr√©
auguste
comte
et
la
philosophic
positive
though
there
are
tolerably
fixed
standards
of
right
and
wrong
and
even
of
generosity
and
meanness
it
may
be
said
that
the
beauty
or
grandeur
of
a
life
is
more
or
less
a
matter
of
taste
and
congreve
notions
of
literary
excellence
are
so
different
from
mine
that
it
may
be
we
should
diverge
as
widely
in
our
judgment
of
moral
beauty
or
ugliness
therefore
while
retaining
my
own
notions
i
do
not
presume
to
quarrel
with
his
but
when
congreve
devotes
a
great
deal
of
laboriously
guarded
insinuation
to
the
endeavour
to
lead
the
public
to
believe
that
i
have
been
guilty
of
the
dishonesty
of
having
criticised
comte
without
having
read
him
i
must
be
permitted
to
remind
him
that
he
has
neglected
the
maxim
of
a
diplomatic
sage
if
you
want
to
damage
a
man
you
should
say
what
is
probable
as
well
as
what
is
true
and
when
congreve
speaks
of
my
having
an
advantage
over
him
in
my
introduction
of
christianity
into
the
phrase
that
philosophy
in
practice
might
be
described
as
catholicism
christianity
intending
thereby
to
suggest
that
i
have
by
so
doing
desired
to
profit
by
an
appeal
to
the
he
lays
himself
open
to
a
very
unpleasant
retort
what
if
i
were
to
suggest
that
congreve
had
not
read
comte
works
and
that
the
phrase
the
context
shows
that
the
view
of
the
writer
ranges
however
superficially
over
the
whole
works
this
is
obvious
from
the
mention
of
catholicism
demonstrates
that
congreve
has
no
acquaintance
with
the
philosophie
positive
i
think
the
suggestion
would
be
very
unjust
and
unmannerly
and
i
shall
not
make
it
but
the
fact
remains
that
this
little
epigram
of
mine
which
has
so
greatly
provoked
congreve
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
condensed
paraphrase
of
the
following
passage
which
is
to
be
found
at

of
the

nothing
can
be
clearer
comte
ideal
as
stated
by
himself
is
catholic
organization
without
catholic
doctrine
or
in
other
words
catholicism
christianity
surely
it
is
utterly
unjustifiable
to
ascribe
to
me
base
motives
for
stating
a
man
doctrines
as
nearly
as
may
be
in
his
own
words
my
readers
would
hardly
be
interested
were
i
to
follow
congreve
any
further
or
i
might
point
out
that
the
fact
of
his
not
having
heard
me
lecture
is
hardly
a
safe
ground
for
his
speculations
as
to
what
i
do
not
teach
nor
do
i
feel
called
upon
to
give
any
opinion
as
to
merits
or
demerits
as
regards
sociology
mill
whose
competence
to
speak
on
these
matters
i
suppose
will
not
be
questioned
even
by
congreve
has
dealt
with
comte
philosophy
from
this
point
of
view
with
a
vigour
and
authority
to
which
i
can
not
for
a
moment
aspire
and
with
a
severity
not
unfrequently
amounting
to
contempt
which
i
have
not
the
wish
if
i
had
the
power
to
surpass
i
as
a
mere
student
in
these
questions
am
content
to
abide
by
mill
judgment
until
some
one
shows
cause
for
its
reversal
and
i
decline
to
enter
into
a
discussion
which
i
have
not
provoked
the
sole
obligation
which
lies
upon
me
is
to
justify
so
much
as
still
remains
without
justification
of
what
i
have
written
respecting
positivism
namely
the
opinion
expressed
in
the
following
paragraph
in
so
far
as
my
study
of
what
specially
characterises
the
positive
philosophy
has
led
me
i
find
therein
little
or
nothing
of
any
scientific
value
and
a
great
deal
which
is
as
thoroughly
antagonistic
to
the
very
essence
of
science
as
any
thing
in
ultramontane
catholicism
here
are
two
propositions
the
first
that
the
philosophie
positive
contains
little
or
nothing
of
any
scientific
value
the
second
that
comtism
is
in
spirit
i
shall
endeavour
to
bring
forward
ample
evidence
in
support
of
both
i
no
one
who
possesses
even
a
superficial
acquaintance
with
physical
science
can
read
comte
le√ßons
without
becoming
aware
that
he
was
at
once
singularly
devoid
of
real
knowledge
on
these
subjects
and
singularly
unlucky
what
is
to
be
thought
of
the
contemporary
of
young
and
of
fresnel
who
never
misses
an
opportunity
of
casting
scorn
upon
the
hypothesis
of
an
ether
the
fundamental
basis
not
only
of
the
undulatory
theory
of
light
but
of
so
much
else
in
modern
physics
and
whose
contempt
for
the
intellects
of
some
of
the
strongest
men
of
his
generation
was
such
that
he
puts
forward
the
mere
existence
of
night
as
a
refutation
of
the
undulatory
theory
what
a
wonderful
gauge
of
his
own
value
as
a
scientific
critic
does
he
afford
by
whom
we
are
informed
that
phrenology
is
a
great
science
and
psychology
a
chim√¶ra
that
gall
was
one
of
the
great
men
of
his
age
and
that
cuvier
was
brilliant
but
superficial
how
unlucky
must
one
consider
the
bold
speculator
who
just
before
the
dawn
of
modern
histology
which
is
simply
the
application
of
the
microscope
to
anatomy
reproves
what
he
calls
the
abuse
of
microscopic
investigations
and
the
exaggerated
credit
attached
to
them
who
when
the
morphological
uniformity
of
the
tissues
of
the
great
majority
of
plants
and
animals
was
on
the
eve
of
being
demonstrated
treated
with
ridicule
those
who
attempt
to
refer
all
tissues
to
a
tissu
g√©n√©rateur
formed
by
le
chim√©rique
et
inintelligible
assemblage
sorte
de
monades
organiques
qui
seraient
d√®s
lors
les
vrais
√©l√©ments
primordiaux
de
tout
corps
vivant
and
who
finally
tells
us
that
all
the
objections
against
a
linear
arrangement
of
the
species
of
living
beings
are
in
their
essence
foolish
and
that
the
order
of
the
animal
series
is
necessarily
linear
when
the
exact
contrary
is
one
of
the
and
the
most
important
truths
of
zoology
appeal
to
mathematicians
astronomers
physicists
chemists
biologists
about
the
philosophie
positive
and
they
all
with
one
consent
begin
to
make
protestation
that
whatever
comte
other
merits
he
has
shed
no
light
upon
the
philosophy
of
their
particular
studies
to
be
just
however
it
must
be
admitted
that
even
comte
most
ardent
disciples
are
content
to
be
judiciously
silent
about
his
knowledge
or
appreciation
of
the
sciences
themselves
and
prefer
to
base
their
master
claims
to
scientific
authority
upon
his
law
of
the
three
states
and
his
classification
of
the
sciences
but
here
also
i
must
join
issue
with
them
as
completely
as
others
notably
herbert
spencer
have
done
before
me
a
critical
examination
of
what
comte
has
to
say
about
the
law
of
the
three
states
brings
out
nothing
but
a
series
of
more
or
less
contradictory
statements
of
an
imperfectly
apprehended
truth
and
his
classification
of
the
sciences
whether
regarded
historically
or
logically
is
in
my
judgment
absolutely
worthless
let
us
consider
the
law
of
the
three
states
as
it
is
put
before
us
in
the
opening
of
the

nothing
can
be
more
precise
than
these
statements
which
may
be
put
into
the
following
propositions
a
the
human
intellect
is
subjected
to
the
law
by
an
invariable
necessity
which
is
demonstrable
from
the
nature
and
constitution
of
the
intellect
while
as
a
matter
of
historical
fact
the
human
intellect
has
been
subjected
to
the
law
b
every
branch
of
human
knowledge
passes
through
the
three
states
necessarily
beginning
with
the
first
stage
c
the
three
states
mutually
exclude
one
another
being
essentially
different
and
even

opposed
two
questions
present
themselves
is
comte
consistent
with
himself
in
making
these
assertions
and
is
he
consistent
with
fact
i
reply
to
both
questions
in
the
negative
and
as

the

i
bring
forward
as
my
witness
a
remarkable
passage
which
is
to
be
found
in

compare
the
propositions
implicitly
laid
down
here
with
those
contained
in
the
earlier
volume
a
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
human
intellect
has
been
invariably
subjected
to
the
law
of
the
three
states
and
therefore
the
necessity
of
the
law
be
demonstrable
b
much
of
our
knowledge
of
all
kinds
has
passed
through
the
three
states
and
more
particularly
as
comte
is
careful
to
point
out
not
through
the
first
c
the
positive
state
has
more
or
less
with
the
theological
from
the
dawn
of
human
intelligence
and
by
way
of
completing
the
series
of
contradictions
the
assertion
that
the
three
states
are
essentially
different
and
even
radically
opposed
is
met
a
little
lower
on
the
same
page
by
the
declaration
that
the
metaphysical
state
is
at
bottom
nothing
but
a
simple
general
modification
of
the
first
while
in
the
fortieth
le√ßon
as
also
in
the
interesting
early
essay
entitled
consid√©rations
philosophiques
sur
les
sciences
et
les

the
three
states
are
practically
reduced

i
leave
cointe
disciples
to
settle
which
of
these
contradictory
statements
expresses
their
master
real
meaning
all
i
beg
leave
to
remark
is
that
men
of
science
are
not
in
the
habit
of
paying
much
attention
to
laws
stated
in
this
fashion
the
second
statement
is
undoubtedly
far
more
rational
and
consistent
with
fact
than
the
first
but
i
can
not
think
it
is
a
just
or
adequate
account
of
the
growth
of
intelligence
either
in
the
individual
man
or
in
the
human
species
any
one
who
will
carefully
watch
the
development
of
the
intellect
of
a
child
will
perceive
that
from
the
first
its
mind
is
mirroring
nature
in
two
different
ways
on
the
one
hand
it
is
merely
drinking
in
sensations
and
building
up
associations
while
it
forms
conceptions
of
things
and
their
relations
which
are
more
thoroughly
positive
or
devoid
of
entanglement
with
hypotheses
of
any
kind
than
they
will
ever
be
in
no
child
has
recourse
to
imaginary
personifications
in
order
to
account
for
the
ordinary
properties
of
objects
which
are
not
alive
or
do
not
represent
living
things
it
does
not
imagine
that
the
taste
of
sugar
is
brought
about
by
a
god
of
sweetness
or
that
a
spirit
of
jumping
causes
a
ball
to
bound
such
ph√¶nomena
which
form
the
basis
of
a
very
large
part
of
its
ideas
are
taken
as
matters
of
course
as
ultimate
facts
which
suggest
no
difficulty
and
need
no
explanation
so
far
as
all
these
common
though
important
ph√¶nomena
are
concerned
the
child
mind
is
in
what
comte
would
call
the
positive
state
but
side
by
side
with
this
mental
condition
there
rises
another
the
child
becomes
aware
of
itself
as
a
source
of
action
and
a
subject
of
passion
and
of
thought
the
acts
which
follow
upon
its
own
desires
are
among
the
most
interesting
and
prominent
of
surrounding
occurrences
and
these
acts
again
plainly
arise
either
out
of
affections
caused
by
surrounding
things
or
of
other
changes
in
itself
among
these
surrounding
things
the
most
interesting
and
important
are
mother
and
father
brethren
and
nurses
the
hypothesis
that
these
wonderful
creatures
are
of
like
nature
to
itself
is
speedily
forced
upon
the
child
mind
and
this
primitive
piece
of
anthropomorphism
turns
out
to
be
a
highly
successful
speculation
which
finds
its
justification
at
every
turn
no
wonder
then
that
it
is
extended
to
other
similarly
interesting
objects
which
are
not
too
unlike
these
to
the
dog
the
cat
and
the
canary
the
doll
the
toy
and
the
that
these
are
endowed
with
wills
and
affections
and
with
capacities
for
being
good
and
naughty
but
surely
it
would
be
a
mere
perversion
of
language
to
call
this
a
theological
state
of
mind
either
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
theological
or
as
contrasted
with
scientific
or
positive
the
child
does
not
worship
either
father
or
mother
dog
or
doll
on
the
contrary
nothing
is
more
curious
than
the
absolute
irreverence
if
i
may
so
say
of
a
young
child
its
tendency
to
believe
in
itself
as
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
its
disposition
to
exercise
despotic
tyranny
over
those
who
could
crush
it
with
a
finger
still
less
is
there
anything
unscientific
or
in
this
infantile
anthropomorphism
the
child
observes
that
many
ph√¶nomena
are
the
consequences
of
affections
of
itself
it
soon
has
excellent
reasons
for
the
belief
that
many
other
ph√¶nomena
are
consequences
of
the
affections
of
other
beings
more
or
less
like
itself
and
having
thus
good
evidence
for
believing
that
many
of
the
most
interesting
occurrences
about
it
are
explicable
on
the
hypothesis
that
they
are
the
work
of
intelligences
like
itself
having
discovered
a
for
many
ph√¶nomena
why
should
the
child
limit
the
application
of
so
fruitful
an
hypothesis
the
dog
has
a
sort
of
intelligence
so
has
the
cat
why
should
not
the
doll
and
the
also
have
a
share
proportioned
to
their
likeness
to
intelligent
things
the
only
limit
which
does
arise
is
exactly
that
which
as
a
matter
of
science
should
arise
that
is
to
say
the
anthropomorphic
interpretation
is
applied
only
to
those
ph√¶nomena
which
in
their
general
nature
or
their
apparent
capriciousness
resemble
those
which
the
child
observes
to
be
caused
by
itself
or
by
beings
like
itself
all
the
rest
are
regarded
as
things
which
explain
themselves
or
are
inexplicable
it
is
only
at
a
later
stage
of
intellectual
development
that
the
intelligence
of
man
awakes
to
the
apparent
conflict
between
the
anthropomorphic
and
what
i
may
call
the
physical
aspect
of
nature
and
either
endeavours
to
extend
the
anthropomorphic
view
over
the
whole
of
nature
which
is
the
tendency
of
theology
or
to
give
the
same
exclusive
predominance
to
the
physical
view
which
is
the
tendency
of
science
or
adopts
a
middle
course
and
taking
from
the
anthropomorphic
view
its
tendency
to
personify
and
from
the
physical
view
its
tendency
to
exclude
volition
and
affection
ends
in
what
comte
calls
the
metaphysical
state
metaphysical
in
writings
being
a
general
term
of
abuse
for
anything
he
does
not
like
what
is
true
of
the
individual
is
true
of
the
intellectual
development
of
the
species
it
is
absurd
to
say
of
men
in
a
state
of
primitive
savagery
that
all
their
conceptions
are
in
a
theological
state
of
them
are
eminently
realistic
and
as
positive
as
ignorance
and
narrowness
can
make
them
it
no
more
occurs
to
a
savage
than
it
does
to
a
child
to
ask
the
why
of
the
daily
and
ordinary
occurrences
which
form
the
greater
part
of
his
mental
life
but
in
regard
to
the
more
striking
or
events
which
force
him
to
speculate
he
is
highly
anthropomorphic
and
as
compared
with
a
child
his
anthropomorphism
is
complicated
by
the
intense
impression
which
the
death
of
his
own
kind
makes
upon
him
as
indeed
it
well
may
the
warrior
full
of
ferocious
energy
perhaps
the
despotic
chief
of
his
tribe
is
suddenly
struck
down
a
child
may
insult
the
man
a
moment
before
so
awful
a
fly
rests
undisturbed
on
the
lips
from
which
undisputed
command
issued
and
yet
the
bodily
aspect
of
the
man
seems
hardly
more
altered
than
when
he
slept
and
sleeping
seemed
to
himself
to
leave
his
body
and
wander
through
dreamland
what
then
if
that
something
which
is
the
essence
of
the
man
has
really
been
made
to
wander
by
the
violence
done
to
it
and
is
unable
or
has
forgotten
to
come
back
to
its
shell
will
it
not
retain
somewhat
of
the
powers
it
possessed
during
life
may
it
not
help
us
if
it
be
pleased
or
as
seems
to
be
by
far
the
more
general
impression
hurt
us
if
it
be
angered
will
it
not
be
well
to
do
towards
it
those
things
which
would
have
soothed
the
man
and
put
him
in
good
humour
during
his
life
it
is
impossible
to
study
trustworthy
accounts
of
savage
thought
without
seeing
that
some
such
train
of
ideas
as
this
lies
at
the
bottom
of
their
speculative
beliefs
there
are
savages
without
god
in
any
proper
sense
of
the
word
but
none
without
ghosts
and
the
fetishism
and
demonology
of
primitive
savages
are
all
i
believe
different
manners
of
expression
of
their
belief
in
ghosts
and
of
the
anthropomorphic
interpretation
of
events
which
is
its
concomitant
witchcraft
and
sorcery
are
the
practical
expressions
of
these
beliefs
and
they
stand
in
the
same
relation
to
religious
worship
as
the
simple
anthropomorphism
of
children
or
savages
does
to
theology
in
the
progress
of
the
species
from
savagery
to
advanced
civilization
anthropomorphism
grows
into
theology
while
physicism
if
i
may
so
call
it
develops
into
science
but
the
development
of
the
two
is
contemporaneous
not
successive
for
each
there
long
exists
an
assured
province
which
is
not
invaded
by
the
other
while
between
the
two
lies
a
debateable
land
ruled
by
a
sort
of
bastards
who
owe
their
complexion
to
physicism
and
their
substance
to
anthropomorphism
and
are
particular
aversions
metaphysical
entities
but
as
the
ages
lengthen
the
borders
of
physicism
increase
the
territories
of
the
bastards
are
all
annexed
to
science
and
even
theology
in
her
purer
forms
has
ceased
to
be
anthropomorphic
however
she
may
talk
anthropomorphism
has
taken
stand
in
its
last
fortress
man
himself
but
science
closely
invests
the
walls
and
philosophers
gird
themselves
for
battle
upon
the
last
and
greatest
of
all
speculative
problems
does
human
nature
possess
any
free
volitional
or
truly
anthropomorphic
element
or
is
it
only
the
cunningest
of
all
clocks
some
among
whom
i
count
myself
think
that
the
battle
will
for
ever
remain
a
drawn
one
and
that
for
all
practical
purposes
this
result
is
as
good
as
anthropomorphism
winning
the
day
the
classification
of
the
sciences
which
in
the
eyes
of
adherents
constitutes
his
second
great
claim
to
the
dignity
of
a
scientific
philosopher
appears
to
me
to
be
open
to
just
the
same
objections
as
the
law
of
the
three
states
it
is
inconsistent
in
itself
and
it
is
inconsistent
with
fact
let
us
consider
the
main
points
of
this
classification
successively

the

exemplifies
the
distinction
between

and

follows

all
the

knowledge
of

comes
out
in
the
passage
i
have
italicised
the

of
living

upon
a
general
study
of
the
laws
of

what
little
i
know
about
the
matter
leads
me
to
think
that
if
comte
had
possessed
the
slightest
practical
acquaintance
with
biological
science
he
would
have
turned
his
phraseology
upside
down
and
have
perceived
that
we
can
have
no
knowledge
of
the
general
laws
of
life
except
that
which
is
based
upon
the
study
of
particular
living
beings
the
illustration
is
surely
unluckily
chosen
but
the
language
in
which
these
abstract
sciences
are
defined
seems
to
me
to
be
still
more
open
to
criticism
with
what
propriety
can
astronomy
or
physics
or
chemistry
or
biology
be
said
to
occupy
themselves
with
the
consideration
of
all
conceivable
cases
which
fall
within
their
respective
provinces
does
the
astronomer
occupy
himself
with
any
other
system
of
the
universe
than
that
which
is
visible
to
him
does
he
speculate
upon
the
possible
movements
of
bodies
which
may
attract
one
another
in
the
inverse
proportion
of
the
cube
of
their
distances
say
does
biology
whether
abstract
or
concrete
occupy
itself
with
any
other
form
of
life
than
those
which
exist
or
have
existed
and
if
the
abstract
sciences
embrace
all
conceivable
cases
of
the
operation
of
the
laws
with
which
they
are
concerned
would
not
they
necessarily
embrace
the
subjects
of
the
concrete
sciences
which
inasmuch
as
they
exist
must
needs
be
conceivable
in
fact
no
such
distinction
as
that
which
comte
draws
is
tenable
the
first
stage
of
his
classification
breaks
by
its
own
weight
but
granting
comte
his
six
abstract
sciences
he
proceeds
to
arrange
them
according
to
what
he
calls
their
natural
order
or
hierarchy
their
places
in
this
hierarchy
being
determined
by
the
degree
of
generality
and
simplicity
of
the
conceptions
with
which
they
deal
mathematics
occupies
the
first
astronomy
the
second
physics
the
third
chemistry
the
fourth
biology
the
fifth
and
sociology
the
sixth
and
last
place
in
the
series
comte
arguments
in
favour
of
this
classification
are
first
sa
conformit√©
essentielle
avec
la
en
quelque
sorte
spontan√©e
qui
se
trouve
en
effet
implicitement
admise
par
les
savants
livr√©s
√†
des
diverse
branches
de
la
philosophie
naturelle
but
i
absolutely
deny
the
existence
of
this
conformity
if
there
is
one
thing
clear
about
the
progress
of
modern
science
it
is
the
tendency
to
reduce
all
scientific
problems
except
those
which
are
purely
mathematical
to
questions
of
molecular
physics
that
is
to
say
to
the
attractions
repulsions
motions
and
of
the
ultimate
particles
of
matter
social
ph√¶nomena
are
the
result
of
the
interaction
of
the
components
of
society
or
men
with
one
another
and
the
surrounding
universe
but
in
the
language
of
physical
science
which
by
the
nature
of
the
case
is
materialistic
the
actions
of
men
so
far
as
they
are
recognisable
by
science
are
the
results
of
molecular
changes
in
the
matter
of
which
they
are
composed
and
in
the
long
run
these
must
come
into
the
hands
of
the
physicist
the
ph√¶nomena
of
biology
and
of
chemistry
are
in
their
ultimate
analysis
questions
of
molecular
physics
indeed
the
fact
is
acknowledged
by
all
chemists
and
biologists
who
look
beyond
their
immediate
occupations
and
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
ph√¶nomena
of
biology
are
as
directly
and
immediately
connected
with
molecular
physics
as
are
those
of
chemistry
molar
physics
chemistry
and
biology
are
not
three
successive
steps
in
the
ladder
of
knowledge
as
comte
would
have
us
believe
but
three
branches
springing
from
the
common
stem
of
molecular
physics
as
to
astronomy
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
any
one
who
will
give
a
moment
attention
to
the
nature
of
the
science
can
fail
to
see
that
it
consists
of
two
parts
first
of
a
description
of
the
ph√¶nomena
which
is
as
much
entitled
as
descriptive
zoology
or
botany
is
to
the
name
of
natural
history
and
secondly
of
an
explanation
of
the
ph√¶nomena
furnished
by
the
laws
of
a
force
gravitation
the
study
of
which
is
as
much
a
part
of
physics
as
is
that
of
heat
or
electricity
it
would
be
just
as
reasonable
to
make
the
study
of
the
heat
of
the
sun
a
science
preliminary
to
the
rest
of
thermotics
as
to
place
the
study
of
the
attraction
of
the
bodies
which
compose
the
universe
in
general
before
that
of
the
particular
terrestrial
bodies
which
alone
we
can
experimentally
know
astronomy
in
fact
owes
its
perfection
to
the
circumstance
that
it
is
the
only
branch
of
natural
history
the
ph√¶nomena
of
which
are
largely
expressible
by
mathematical
conceptions
and
which
can
be
to
a
great
extent
explained
by
the
application
of
very
simple
physical
laws
with
regard
to
mathematics
it
is
to
be
observed
in
the
first
place
that
comte
mixes
up
under
that
head
the
pure
relations
of
space
and
of
quantity
which
are
properly
included
under
the
name
with
rational
mechanics
and
statics
which
are
mathematical
developments
of
the
most
general
conceptions
of
physics
namely
the
notions
of
force
and
of
motion
relegating
these
to
their
proper
place
in
physics
we
have
left
pure
mathematics
which
can
stand
neither
at
the
head
nor
at
the
tail
of
any
hierarchy
of
the
sciences
since
like
logic
it
is
equally
related
to
all
though
the
enormous
practical
difficulty
of
applying
mathematics
to
the
more
complex
ph√¶nomena
of
nature
removes
them
for
the
present
out
of
its
sphere
on
this
subject
of
mathematics
again
comte
indulges
in
assertions
which
can
only
be
accounted
for
by
his
total
ignorance
of
physical
science
practically
as
for
example

that
is
to
say
the
only
study
which
can
confer
a
just
and
comprehensive
idea
of
what
is
meant
by
science
and
at
the
same
time
furnish
an
exact
conception
of
the
general
method
of
scientific
investigation
is
that
which
knows
nothing
of
observation
nothing
of
experiment
nothing
of
induction
nothing
of
causation
and
education
the
whole
secret
of
which
consists
in
proceeding

the
easy
to
the
difficult
the
concrete
to
the
abstract
ought
to
be
turned
the
other
way
and
pass
from

abstract
to
the
concrete
comte
puts
a
second
argument
in
favour
of
his
hierarchy
of
the
sciences
thus
un

caract√®re
de

classification
n√©cessairement
conforme
√†
effectif
du
d√©veloppement
de
la
philosophie
naturelle
ce
que
v√©rifie
tout
ce
sait
de
des
sciences
but
spencer
has
so
thoroughly
and
completely
demonstrated
the
absence
of
any
correspondence
between
the
historical
development
of
the
sciences
and
their
position
in
the
comtean
hierarchy
in
his
essay
on
the
genesis
of
science
that
i
shall
not
waste
time
in
repeating
his
refutation
a
third
proposition
in
support
of
the
comtean
classification
of
the
sciences
stands
as
follows
en
troisi√®me
lieu
cette
classification
pr√©sente
la
propri√©t√©
de
marquer
exactement
la
perfection
relative
des
diff√©rentes
sciences
laquelle
consiste
essentiellement
dans
le
degr√©
de
pr√©cision
des
connaissances
et
dans
leur
plus
ou
moins
intime
i
am
quite
unable
to
understand
the
distinction
which
comte
endeavours
to
draw
in
this
passage
in
spite
of
his
amplifications
further
on
every
science
must
consist
of
precise
knowledge
and
that
knowledge
must
be
into
general
proportions
or
it
is
not
science
when
comte
in
exemplification
of
the
statement
i
have
cited
says
that
les
ph√©nom√®nes
organiques
ne
comportent
√©tude
√†
la
fois
moins
exacte
et
moins
syst√©matique
que
les
ph√©nom√®nes
des
corps
bruts
i
am
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
what
he
means
if
i
affirm
that
when
a
motor
nerve
is
irritated
the
muscle
connected
with
it
becomes
simultaneously
shorter
and
thicker
without
changing
its
volume
it
appears
to
me
that
the
statement
is
as
precise
or
exact
and
not
merely
as
true
as
that
of
the
physicist
who
should
say
that
when
a
piece
of
iron
is
heated
it
becomes
simultaneously
longer
and
thicker
and
increases
in
volume
nor
can
i
discover
any
difference
in
point
of
precision
between
the
statement
of
the
morphological
law
that
animals
which
suckle
their
young
have
two
occipital
condyles
and
the
enunciation
of
the
physical
law
that
water
subjected
to
electrolysis
is
replaced
by
an
equal
weight
of
the
gases
oxygen
and
hydrogen
as
for
anatomical
or
physiological
investigation
being
less
systematic
than
that
of
the
physicist
or
chemist
the
assertion
is
simply
unaccountable
the
methods
of
physical
science
are
everywhere
the
same
in
principle
and
the
physiological
investigator
who
was
not
systematic
would
on
the
whole
break
down
rather
sooner
than
the
inquirer
into
simpler
subjects
thus
comte
classification
of
the
sciences
under
all
its
aspects
appears
to
me
to
be
a
complete
failure
it
is
impossible
in
an
article
which
is
already
too
long
to
inquire
how
it
may
be
replaced
by
a
better
and
it
is
the
less
necessary
to
do
so
as
a
second
edition
of
spencer
remarkable
essay
on
this
subject
has
just
been
published
after
wading
through
pages
of
the
confusion
and
information
of
the
philosophic
positive
at
the
risk
of
a
it
is
as
good
as
a
to
turn
to
the
classification
of
the
sciences
and
refresh
oneself
with
profound
thought
precise
knowledge
and
clear
language
ii
the
second
proposition
to
which
i
have
committed
myself
in
the
paper
to
which
i
have
been
obliged
to
refer
so
often
is
that
the
positive
philosophy
contains
a
great
deal
which
is
as
thoroughly
antagonistic
to
the
very
essence
of
science
as
is
anything
in
ultramontane
catholicism
what
i
refer
to
in
these
words
is
on
the
one
hand
the
dogmatism
and
narrowness
which
so
often
mark
comte
discussion
of
doctrines
which
he
does
not
like
and
reduce
his
expressions
of
opinion
to
mere
passionate
puerilities
as
for
example
when
he
is
arguing
against
the
assumption
of
an
ether
or
when
he
is
talking
i
can
not
call
it
arguing
against
psychology
or
political
economy
on
the
other
hand
i
allude
to
the
spirit
of
meddling
systematization
and
regulation
which
animates
even
the
philosophic
positive
and
breaks
out
in
the
latter
volumes
of
that
work
into
no
uncertain
foreshadowing
of
the
monstrosities
of
comte
later
writings
those
who
try
to
draw
a
line
of
demarcation
between
the
spirit
of
the
philosophic
positive
and
that
of
the
politique
and
its
successors
if
i
may
express
an
opinion
from
fragmentary
knowledge
of
these
last
must
have
overlooked
or
forgotten
what
comte
himself
labours
to
show
and
indeed
succeeds
in
proving
in
the
appendice
g√©n√©ral
of
the
politique
positive
d√®s
mon
d√©but
he
writes
je
tentai
de

le

que
ma

loin
aucunement
oppos√©e

ma

constitue
tellement
la
suite
naturelle
que
fut
directement
institu√©e
pour
servir
de
base
√†
comme
le
prouve
cet
appendice
this
is
quite
true
in
the
remarkable
essay
entitled
consid√©rations
sur
le
pouvoir
spirituel
published
in
march
comte
advocates
the
establishment
of
a
modern
spiritual
power
which
he
anticipates
may
exercise
an
even
greater
influence
over
temporal
affairs
than
did
the
catholic
clergy
at
the
height
of
their
vigour
and
independence
in
the
twelfth
century
this
spiritual
power
is
in
fact
to
govern
opinion
and
to
have
the
supreme
control
over
education
in
each
nation
of
the
west
and
the
spiritual
powers
of
the
several
european
peoples
are
to
be
associated
together
and
placed
under
a
common
direction
or
souverainet√©
spirituelle
a
system
of
catholicism
christianity
was
therefore
completely
organized
in
comte
mind
four
years
before
the
first
volume
of
the
philosophie
positive
was
written
and
naturally
the
papal
spirit
shows
itself
in
that
work
not
only
in
the
ways
i
have
already
mentioned
but
notably
in
the
attack
on
liberty
of
conscience
which
breaks
out
in
the
fourth
volume
il

comp√©tents
nothing
in
ultramontane
catholicism
can
in
my
judgment
be
more
completely
sacerdotal
more
entirely
than
this
dictum
all
the
great
steps
in
the
advancement
of
science
have
been
made
by
just
those
men
who
have
not
hesitated
to
doubt
the
principles
established
in
the
sciences
by
competent
persons
and
the
great
teaching
of
science
the
great
use
of
it
as
an
instrument
of
mental
discipline
is
its
constant
inculcation
of
the
maxim
that
the
sole
ground
on
which
any
statement
has
a
right
to
be
believed
is
the
impossibility
of
refuting
it
thus
without
travelling
beyond
the
limits
of
the
philosophie
positive
we
find
its
author
contemplating
the
establishment
of
a
system
of
society
in
which
an
organized
spiritual
power
shall
and
direct
the
temporal
power
as
completely
as
the
innocents
and
gregorys
tried
to
govern
europe
in
the
middle
ages
and
repudiating
the
exercise
of
liberty
of
conscience
against
the
of
whom
by
the
assumption
the
new
priesthood
would
be
composed
was
congreve
as
forgetful
of
this
as
he
seems
to
have
been
of
some
other
parts
of
the
philosophie
positive
when
he
wrote
that
in
any
limited
careful
use
of
the
term
no
candid
man
could
say
that
the
positive
philosophy
contained
a
great
deal
as
thoroughly
antagonistic
to
the
very
essence
of
science
as
catholicism
comte
it
will
have
been
observed
desires
to
retain
the
whole
of
catholic
organization
and
the
logical
practical
result
of
this
part
of
his
doctrine
would
be
the
establishment
of
something
corresponding
with
that
eminently
catholic
but
admittedly
institution
the
holy
office
i
hope
i
have
said
enough
to
show
that
i
wrote
the
few
lines
i
devoted
to
comte
and
his
philosophy
neither
unguardedly
nor
ignorantly
still
less
maliciously
i
shall
be
sorry
if
what
i
have
now
added
in
my
own
justification
should
lead
any
to
suppose
that
i
think
works
worthless
or
that
i
do
not
heartily
respect
and
sympathise
with
those
who
have
been
impelled
by
him
to
think
deeply
upon
social
problems
and
to
strive
nobly
for
social
regeneration
it
is
the
virtue
of
that
impulse
i
believe
which
will
save
the
name
and
fame
of
auguste
comte
from
oblivion
as
for
his
philosophy
i
part
with
it
by
quoting
his
own
words
reported
to
me
by
a
quondam

i
am
glad
to
observe
that
congreve
in
the
criticism
with
which
he
has
favoured
me
in
the
number
of
the
for
april
does
not
venture
to
challenge
the
justice
of
the
claim
i
make
for
hume
he
merely
suggests
that
i
have
been
wanting
in
candour
in
not
mentioning
comte
high
opinion
of
hume
after
mature
reflection
i
am
unable
to
discern
my
fault
if
i
had
suggested
that
comte
had
borrowed
from
hume
without
acknowledgment
or
if
instead
of
trying
to
express
my
own
sense
of
hume
merits
with
the
modesty
which
becomes
a
writer
who
has
no
authority
in
matters
of
philosophy
i
had
affirmed
that
no
one
had
properly
appreciated
him
congreve
remarks
would
apply
but
as
i
did
neither
of
these
things
they
appear
to
me
to
be
irrelevant
if
not
unjustifiable
and
even
had
it
occurred
to
me
to
quote
expressions
about
hume
i
do
not
know
that
i
should
have
cited
them
inasmuch
as
on
his
own
showing
comte
occasionally
speaks

on

of

a
lecture
to
working
men
if
a
well
were
to
be
sunk
at
our
feet
in
the
midst
of
the
city
of
norwich
the
diggers
would
very
soon
find
themselves
at
work
in
that
white
substance
almost
too
soft
to
be
called
rock
with
which
we
are
all
familiar
as
chalk
not
only
here
but
over
the
whole
county
of
norfolk
the
might
carry
his
shaft
down
many
hundred
feet
without
coming
to
the
end
of
the
chalk
and
on
the
where
the
waves
have
pared
away
the
face
of
the
land
which
breasts
them
the
scarped
faces
of
the
high
cliffs
are
often
wholly
formed
of
the
same
material
northward
the
chalk
may
be
followed
as
far
as
yorkshire
on
the
south
coast
it
appears
abruptly
in
the
picturesque
western
bays
of
dorset
and
breaks
into
the
needles
of
the
isle
of
wight
while
on
the
shores
of
kent
it
supplies
that
long
line
of
white
cliffs
to
which
england
owes
her
name
of
albion
were
the
thin
soil
which
covers
it
all
washed
away
a
curved
band
of
white
chalk
here
broader
and
there
narrower
might
be
followed
diagonally
across
england
from
lulworth
in
dorset
to
flamborough
head
in
yorkshire
a
distance
of
over
miles
as
the
crow
flies
from
this
band
to
the
north
sea
on
the
east
and
the
channel
on
the
south
the
chalk
is
largely
hidden
by
other
deposits
but
except
in
the
weald
of
kent
and
sussex
it
enters
into
the
very
foundation
of
all
the
counties
attaining
as
it
does
in
some
places
a
thickness
of
more
than
a
thousand
feet
the
english
chalk
must
be
admitted
to
be
a
mass
of
considerable
magnitude
nevertheless
it
covers
but
an
insignificant
portion
of
the
whole
area
occupied
by
the
chalk
formation
of
the
globe
which
has
precisely
the
same
general
characters
as
ours
and
is
found
in
detached
patches
some
less
and
others
more
extensive
than
the
english
chalk
occurs
in
ireland
it
stretches
over
a
large
part
of
france
the
chalk
which
underlies
paris
being
in
fact
a
continuation
of
that
of
the
london
basin
it
runs
through
denmark
and
central
europe
and
extends
southward
to
north
africa
while
eastward
it
appears
in
the
crimea
and
in
syria
and
may
be
traced
as
far
as
the
shores
of
the
sea
of
aral
in
central
asia
if
all
the
points
at
which
true
chalk
occurs
were
circumscribed
they
would
lie
within
an
irregular
oval
about
miles
in
long
diameter
the
area
of
which
would
be
as
great
as
that
of
europe
and
would
many
times
exceed
that
of
the
largest
existing
inland
sea
the
mediterranean
thus
the
chalk
is
no
unimportant
element
in
the
masonry
of
the
crust
and
it
impresses
a
peculiar
stamp
varying
with
the
conditions
to
which
it
is
exposed
on
the
scenery
of
the
districts
in
which
it
occurs
the
undulating
downs
and
rounded
coombs
covered
with
turf
of
our
inland
chalk
country
have
a
peacefully
domestic
and
prettiness
but
can
hardly
be
called
either
grand
or
beautiful
but
on
our
southern
coasts
the
cliffs
many
hundred
feet
high
with
vast
needles
and
pinnacles
standing
out
in
the
sea
sharp
and
solitary
enough
to
serve
as
perches
for
the
wary
cormorant
confer
a
wonderful
beauty
and
grandeur
upon
the
chalk
headlands
and
in
the
east
chalk
has
its
share
in
the
formation
of
some
of
the
most
venerable
of
mountain
ranges
such
as
the
lebanon
what
is
this
component
of
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
whence
did
it
come
you
may
think
this
no
very
hopeful
inquiry
you
may
not
unnaturally
suppose
that
the
attempt
to
solve
such
problems
as
these
can
lead
to
no
result
save
that
of
entangling
the
inquirer
in
vague
speculations
incapable
of
refutation
and
of
verification
if
such
were
really
the
case
i
should
have
selected
some
other
subject
than
a
piece
of
chalk
for
my
discourse
but
in
truth
after
much
deliberation
i
have
been
unable
to
think
of
any
topic
which
would
so
well
enable
me
to
lead
you
to
see
how
solid
is
the
foundation
upon
which
some
of
the
most
startling
conclusions
of
physical
science
rest
a
great
chapter
of
the
history
of
the
world
is
written
in
the
chalk
few
passages
in
the
history
of
man
can
be
supported
by
such
an
overwhelming
mass
of
direct
and
indirect
evidence
as
that
which
testifies
to
the
truth
of
the
fragment
of
the
history
of
the
globe
which
i
hope
to
enable
you
to
read
with
your
own
eyes
let
me
add
that
few
chapters
of
human
history
have
a
more
profound
significance
for
ourselves
i
weigh
my
words
well
when
i
assert
that
the
man
who
should
know
the
true
history
of
the
bit
of
chalk
which
every
carpenter
carries
about
in
his
though
ignorant
of
all
other
history
is
likely
if
he
will
think
his
knowledge
out
to
its
ultimate
results
to
have
a
truer
and
therefore
a
better
conception
of
this
wonderful
universe
and
of
man
relation
to
it
than
the
most
learned
student
who
is
in
the
records
of
humanity
and
ignorant
of
those
of
nature
the
language
of
the
chalk
is
not
hard
to
learn
not
nearly
so
hard
as
latin
if
you
only
want
to
get
at
the
broad
features
of
the
story
it
has
to
tell
and
i
propose
that
we
now
set
to
work
to
spell
that
story
out
together
we
all
know
that
if
we
burn
chalk
the
result
is
quicklime
chalk
in
fact
is
a
compound
of
carbonic
acid
gas
and
lime
and
when
you
make
it
very
hot
the
carbonic
acid
flies
away
and
the
lime
is
left
by
this
method
of
procedure
we
see
the
lime
but
we
do
not
see
the
carbonic
acid
if
on
the
other
hand
you
were
to
powder
a
little
chalk
and
drop
it
into
a
good
deal
of
strong
vinegar
there
would
be
a
great
bubbling
and
fizzing
and
finally
a
clear
liquid
in
which
no
sign
of
chalk
would
appear
here
you
see
the
carbonic
acid
in
the
bubbles
the
lime
dissolved
in
the
vinegar
vanishes
from
sight
there
are
a
great
many
other
ways
of
showing
that
chalk
is
essentially
nothing
but
carbonic
acid
and
quicklime
chemists
enunciate
the
result
of
all
the
experiments
which
prove
this
by
stating
that
chalk
is
almost
wholly
composed
of
carbonate
of
lime
it
is
desirable
for
us
to
start
from
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
though
it
may
not
seem
to
help
us
very
far
towards
what
we
seek
for
carbonate
of
lime
is
a
substance
and
is
met
with
under
very
various
conditions
all
sorts
of
limestones
are
composed
of
more
or
less
pure
carbonate
of
lime
the
crust
which
is
often
deposited
by
waters
which
have
drained
through
limestone
rocks
in
the
form
of
what
are
called
stalagmites
and
stalactites
is
carbonate
of
lime
or
to
take
a
more
familiar
example
the
fur
on
the
inside
of
a
is
carbonate
of
lime
and
for
anything
chemistry
tells
us
to
the
contrary
the
chalk
might
be
a
kind
of
gigantic
fur
upon
the
bottom
of
the
which
is
kept
pretty
hot
below
let
us
try
another
method
of
making
the
chalk
tell
us
its
own
history
to
the
unassisted
eye
chalk
looks
simply
like
a
very
loose
and
open
kind
of
stone
but
it
is
possible
to
grind
a
slice
of
chalk
down
so
thin
that
you
can
see
through
it
until
it
is
thin
enough
in
fact
to
be
examined
with
any
magnifying
power
that
may
be
thought
desirable
a
thin
slice
of
the
fur
of
a
kettle
might
be
made
in
the
same
way
if
it
were
examined
microscopically
it
would
show
itself
to
be
a
more
or
less
distinctly
laminated
mineral
substance
and
nothing
more
but
the
slice
of
chalk
presents
a
totally
different
appearance
when
placed
under
the
microscope
the
general
mass
of
it
is
made
up
of
very
minute
granules
but
imbedded
in
this
matrix
are
innumerable
bodies
some
smaller
and
some
larger
but
on
a
rough
average
not
more
than
a
hundredth
of
an
inch
in
diameter
having
a
shape
and
structure
a
cubic
inch
of
some
specimens
of
chalk
may
contain
hundreds
of
thousands
of
these
bodies
compacted
together
with
incalculable
millions
of
the
granules
the
examination
of
a
transparent
slice
gives
a
good
notion
of
the
manner
in
which
the
components
of
the
chalk
are
arranged
and
of
their
relative
proportions
but
by
rubbing
up
some
chalk
with
a
brush
in
water
and
then
pouring
off
the
milky
fluid
so
as
to
obtain
sediments
of
different
degrees
of
fineness
the
granules
and
the
minute
rounded
bodies
may
be
pretty
well
separated
from
one
another
and
submitted
to
microscopic
examination
either
as
opaque
or
as
transparent
objects
by
combining
the
views
obtained
in
these
various
methods
each
of
the
rounded
bodies
may
be
proved
to
be
a
calcareous
fabric
made
up
of
a
number
of
chambers
communicating
freely
with
one
another
the
chambered
bodies
are
of
various
forms
one
of
the
commonest
is
something
like
a
raspberry
being
formed
of
a
number
of
nearly
globular
chambers
of
different
sizes
congregated
together
it
is
called
and
some
specimens
of
chalk
consist
of
little
else
than
and
granules
let
us
fix
our
attention
upon
the
it
is
the
spoor
of
the
game
we
are
tracking
if
we
can
learn
what
it
is
and
what
are
the
conditions
of
its
existence
we
shall
see
our
way
to
the
origin
and
past
history
of
the
chalk
a
suggestion
which
may
naturally
enough
present
itself
is
that
these
curious
bodies
are
the
result
of
some
process
of
aggregation
which
has
taken
place
in
the
carbonate
of
lime
that
just
as
in
winter
the
rime
on
our
windows
simulates
the
most
delicate
and
elegantly
arborescent
foliage
proving
that
the
mere
mineral
water
may
under
certain
conditions
assume
the
outward
form
of
organic
bodies
so
this
mineral
substance
carbonate
of
lime
hidden
away
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
has
taken
the
shape
of
these
chambered
bodies
i
am
not
raising
a
merely
fanciful
and
unreal
objection
very
learned
men
in
former
days
have
even
entertained
the
notion
that
all
the
formed
things
found
in
rocks
are
of
this
nature
and
if
no
such
conception
is
at
present
held
to
be
admissible
it
is
because
long
and
varied
experience
has
now
shown
that
mineral
matter
never
does
assume
the
form
and
structure
we
find
in
fossils
if
any
one
were
to
try
to
persuade
you
that
an
which
is
also
chiefly
composed
of
carbonate
of
lime
had
crystallized
out
of
i
suppose
you
would
laugh
at
the
absurdity
your
laughter
would
be
justified
by
the
fact
that
all
experience
tends
to
show
that
are
formed
by
the
agency
of
oysters
and
in
no
other
way
and
if
there
were
no
better
reasons
we
should
be
justified
on
like
grounds
in
believing
that
is
not
the
product
of
anything
but
vital
activity
happily
however
better
evidence
in
proof
of
the
organic
nature
of
the
than
that
of
analogy
is
forthcoming
it
so
happens
that
calcareous
skeletons
exactly
similar
to
the
of
the
chalk
are
being
formed
at
the
present
moment
by
minute
living
creatures
which
flourish
in
multitudes
literally
more
numerous
than
the
sands
of
the
over
a
large
extent
of
that
part
of
the
earth
surface
which
is
covered
by
the
ocean
the
history
of
the
discovery
of
these
living
and
of
the
part
which
they
play
in
is
singular
enough
it
is
a
discovery
which
like
others
of
no
less
scientific
importance
has
arisen
incidentally
out
of
work
devoted
to
very
different
and
exceedingly
practical
interests
when
men
first
took
to
the
sea
they
speedily
learned
to
look
out
for
shoals
and
rocks
and
the
more
the
burthen
of
their
ships
increased
the
more
imperatively
necessary
it
became
for
sailors
to
ascertain
with
precision
the
depth
of
the
waters
they
traversed
out
of
this
necessity
grew
the
use
of
the
lead
and
and
ultimately
which
is
the
recording
of
the
form
of
coasts
and
of
the
depth
of
the
sea
as
ascertained
by
the
upon
charts
at
the
same
time
it
became
desirable
to
ascertain
and
to
indicate
the
nature
of
the
since
this
circumstance
greatly
affects
its
goodness
as
holding
ground
for
anchors
some
ingenious
tar
whose
name
deserves
a
better
fate
than
the
oblivion
into
which
it
has
fallen
attained
this
object
by
arming
the
bottom
of
the
lead
with
a
lump
of
grease
to
which
more
or
less
of
the
sand
or
mud
or
broken
shells
as
the
case
might
be
adhered
and
was
brought
to
the
surface
but
however
well
adapted
such
an
apparatus
might
be
for
rough
nautical
purposes
scientific
accuracy
could
not
be
expected
from
the
armed
lead
and
to
remedy
its
defects
especially
when
applied
to
sounding
in
great
depths
lieut
brooke
of
the
american
navy
some
years
ago
invented
a
most
ingenious
machine
by
which
a
considerable
portion
of
the
superficial
layer
of
the
can
be
scooped
out
and
brought
up
from
any
depth
to
which
the
lead
descends
in
lieut

obtained
mud
from
the
bottom
of
the
north
atlantic
between
newfoundland
and
the
azores
at
a
depth
of
more
than
feet
or
two
miles
by
the
help
of
this
sounding
apparatus
the
specimens
were
sent
for
examination
to
ehrenberg
of
berlin
and
to
bailey
of
west
point
and
those
able
microscopists
found
that
this
mud
was
almost
entirely
composed
of
the
skeletons
of
living
organisms
the
greater
proportion
of
these
being
just
like
the
already
known
to
occur
in
the
chalk
thus
far
the
work
had
been
carried
on
simply
in
the
interests
of
science
but
lieut
brooke
method
of
sounding
acquired
a
high
commercial
value
when
the
enterprise
of
laying
down
the
between
this
country
and
the
united
states
was
undertaken
for
it
became
a
matter
of
immense
importance
to
know
not
only
the
depth
of
the
sea
over
the
whole
line
along
which
the
cable
was
to
be
laid
but
the
exact
nature
of
the
bottom
so
as
to
guard
against
chances
of
cutting
or
fraying
the
strands
of
that
costly
rope
the
admiralty
consequently
ordered
captain
dayman
an
old
friend
and
shipmate
of
mine
to
ascertain
the
depth
over
the
whole
line
of
the
cable
and
to
bring
back
specimens
of
the
bottom
in
former
days
such
a
command
as
this
might
have
sounded
very
much
like
one
of
the
impossible
things
which
the
young
prince
in
the
fairy
tales
is
ordered
to
do
before
he
can
obtain
the
hand
of
the
princess
however
in
the
months
of
june
and
july
my
friend
performed
the
task
assigned
to
him
with
great
expedition
and
precision
without
so
far
as
i
know
having
met
with
any
reward
of
that
kind
the
specimens
of
atlantic
mud
which
he
procured
were
sent
to
me
to
be
examined
and
reported
upon
the
result
of
all
these
operations
is
that
we
know
the
contours
and
the
nature
of
the
covered
by
the
north
atlantic
for
a
distance
of
miles
from
east
to
west
as
well
as
we
know
that
of
any
part
of
the
dry
land
it
is
a
prodigious
plain
one
of
the
widest
and
most
even
plains
in
the
world
if
the
sea
were
drained
off
you
might
drive
a
wagon
all
the
way
from
valentia
on
the
west
coast
of
ireland
to
trinity
bay
in
newfoundland
and
except
upon
one
sharp
incline
about
miles
from
valentia
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
it
would
even
be
necessary
to
put
the
skid
on
so
gentle
are
the
ascents
and
descents
upon
that
long
route
from
valentia
the
road
would
lie
down
hill
for
about
miles
to
the
point
at
which
the
bottom
is
now
covered
by
fathoms
of
then
would
come
the
central
plain
more
than
a
thousand
miles
wide
the
inequalities
of
the
surface
of
which
would
be
hardly
perceptible
though
the
depth
of
water
upon
it
now
varies
from
to
feet
and
there
are
places
in
which
mont
blanc
might
be
sunk
without
showing
its
peak
above
water
beyond
this
the
ascent
on
the
american
side
commences
and
gradually
leads
for
about
miles
to
the
newfoundland
shore
almost
the
whole
of
the
bottom
of
this
central
plain
which
extends
for
many
hundred
miles
in
a
north
and
south
direction
is
covered
by
a
fine
mud
which
when
brought
to
the
surface
dries
into
a
friable
substance
you
can
write
with
this
on
a
blackboard
if
you
are
so
inclined
and
to
the
eye
it
is
quite
like
very
soft
greyish
chalk
examined
chemically
it
proves
to
be
composed
almost
wholly
of
carbonate
of
lime
and
if
you
make
a
section
of
it
in
the
same
way
as
that
of
the
piece
of
chalk
was
made
and
view
it
with
the
microscope
it
presents
innumerable
embedded
in
a
granular
matrix
thus
this
mud
is
substantially
chalk
i
say
substantially
because
there
are
a
good
many
minor
differences
but
as
these
have
no
bearing
on
the
question
immediately
before
us
which
is
the
nature
of
the
of
the
chalk
it
is
unnecessary
to
speak
of
them
of
every
size
from
the
smallest
to
the
largest
are
associated
together
in
the
atlantic
mud
and
the
chambers
of
many
are
filled
by
a
soft
animal
matter
this
soft
substance
is
in
fact
the
remains
of
the
creature
to
which
the
shell
or
rather
skeleton
owes
its
existence
and
which
is
an
animal
of
the
simplest
imaginable
description
it
is
in
fact
a
mere
particle
of
living
jelly
without
defined
parts
of
any
kind
without
a
mouth
nerves
muscles
or
distinct
organs
and
only
manifesting
its
vitality
to
ordinary
observation
by
thrusting
out
and
retracting
from
all
parts
of
its
surface
long
filamentous
processes
which
serve
for
arms
and
legs
yet
this
amorphous
particle
devoid
of
everything
which
in
the
higher
animals
we
call
organs
is
capable
of
feeding
growing
and
multiplying
of
separating
from
the
ocean
the
small
proportion
of
carbonate
of
lime
which
is
dissolved
in
and
of
building
up
that
substance
into
a
skeleton
for
itself
according
to
a
pattern
which
can
be
imitated
by
no
other
known
agency
the
notion
that
animals
can
live
and
flourish
in
the
sea
at
the
vast
depths
from
which
apparently
living
have
been
brought
up
does
not
agree
very
well
with
our
usual
conceptions
respecting
the
conditions
of
animal
life
and
it
is
not
so
absolutely
impossible
as
it
might
at
first
sight
appear
to
be
that
the
of
the
atlantic
do
not
live
and
die
where
they
are
found
as
i
have
mentioned
the
soundings
from
the
great
atlantic
plain
are
almost
entirely
made
up
of
with
the
granules
which
have
been
mentioned
and
some
few
other
calcareous
shells
but
a
small
percentage
of
the
chalky
mud
perhaps
at
most
some
five
per
cent
of
it
is
of
a
different
nature
and
consists
of
shells
and
skeletons
composed
of
silex
or
pure
flint
these
silicious
bodies
belong
partly
to
the
lowly
vegetable
organisms
which
are
called
and
partly
to
the
minute
and
extremely
simple
animals
termed
it
is
quite
certain
that
these
creatures
do
not
live
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
but
at
its
surface
where
they
may
be
obtained
in
prodigious
numbers
by
the
use
of
a
properly
constructed
net
hence
it
follows
that
these
silicious
organisms
though
they
are
not
heavier
than
the
lightest
dust
must
have
fallen
in
some
cases
through
fifteen
thousand
feet
of
water
before
they
reached
their
final
on
the
ocean
floor
and
considering
how
large
a
surface
these
bodies
expose
in
proportion
to
their
weight
it
is
probable
that
they
occupy
a
great
length
of
time
in
making
their
burial
journey
from
the
surface
of
the
atlantic
to
the
bottom
but
if
the
and
diatoms
are
thus
rained
upon
the
bottom
of
the
sea
from
the
superficial
layer
of
its
waters
in
which
they
pass
their
lives
it
is
obviously
possible
that
the
may
be
similarly
derived
and
if
they
were
so
it
would
be
much
more
easy
to
understand
how
they
obtain
their
supply
of
food
than
it
is
at
present
nevertheless
the
positive
and
negative
evidence
all
points
the
other
way
the
skeletons
of
the
are
so
remarkably
solid
and
heavy
in
proportion
to
their
surface
as
to
seem
little
fitted
for
floating
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
are
not
to
be
found
along
with
the
diatoms
and
in
the
uppermost
stratum
of
the
open
ocean
it
has
been
observed
again
that
the
abundance
of
in
proportion
to
other
organisms
of
like
kind
increases
with
the
depth
of
the
sea
and
that
are
larger
than
those
which
live
in
shallower
parts
of
the
sea
and
such
facts
negative
the
supposition
that
these
organisms
have
been
swept
by
currents
from
the
shallows
into
the
deeps
of
the
atlantic
it
therefore
seems
to
be
hardly
doubtful
that
these
wonderful
creatures
live
and
die
at
the
depths
in
which
they
are
found
however
the
important
points
for
us
are
that
the
living
are
exclusively
marine
animals
the
skeletons
of
which
abound
at
the
bottom
of
deep
seas
and
that
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
reason
for
believing
that
the
habits
of
the
of
the
chalk
differed
from
those
of
the
existing
species
but
if
this
be
true
there
is
no
escaping
the
conclusion
that
the
chalk
itself
is
the
dried
mud
of
an
ancient
deep
sea
in
working
over
the
soundings
collected
by
captain
dayman
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
many
of
what
i
have
called
the
granules
of
that
mud
were
not
as
one
might
have
been
tempted
to
think
at
first
the
mere
powder
and
waste
of
but
that
they
had
a
definite
form
and
size
i
termed
these
bodies
and
doubted
their
organic
nature
wallich
verified
my
observation
and
added
the
interesting
discovery
that
not
unfrequently
bodies
similar
to
these
coccoliths
were
aggregated
together
into
spheroids
which
he
termed
so
far
as
we
knew
these
bodies
the
nature
of
which
is
extremely
puzzling
and
problematical
were
peculiar
to
the
atlantic
soundings
but
a
few
years
ago
sorby
in
making
a
careful
examination
of
the
chalk
by
means
of
thin
sections
and
otherwise
observed
as
ehrenberg
had
done
before
him
that
much
of
its
granular
basis
possesses
a
definite
form
comparing
these
formed
particles
with
those
in
the
atlantic
soundings
he
found
the
two
to
be
identical
and
thus
proved
that
the
chalk
like
the
soundings
contains
these
mysterious
coccoliths
and
coccospheres
here
was
a
further
and
a
most
interesting
confirmation
from
internal
evidence
of
the
essential
identity
of
the
chalk
with
modern
mud
coccoliths
and
coccospheres
are
found
as
the
chief
constituents
of
both
and
testify
to
the
general
similarity
of
the
conditions
under
which
both
have
been
formed
the
evidence
furnished
by
the
hewing
facing
and
superposition
of
the
stones
of
the
pyramids
that
these
structures
were
built
by
men
has
no
greater
weight
than
the
evidence
that
the
chalk
was
built
by
and
the
belief
that
those
ancient
were
terrestrial
and
creatures
like
ourselves
is
not
better
based
than
the
conviction
that
the
lived
in
the
sea
but
as
our
belief
in
the
building
of
the
pyramids
by
men
is
not
only
grounded
on
the
internal
evidence
afforded
by
these
structures
but
gathers
strength
from
multitudinous
collateral
proofs
and
is
clinched
by
the
total
absence
of
any
reason
for
a
contrary
belief
so
the
evidence
drawn
from
the
that
the
chalk
is
an
ancient
is
fortified
by
innumerable
independent
lines
of
evidence
and
our
belief
in
the
truth
of
the
conclusion
to
which
all
positive
testimony
tends
receives
the
like
negative
justification
from
the
fact
that
no
other
hypothesis
has
a
shadow
of
foundation
it
may
be
worth
while
briefly
to
consider
a
few
of
these
collateral
proofs
that
the
chalk
was
deposited
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
the
great
mass
of
the
chalk
is
composed
as
we
have
seen
of
the
skeletons
of
and
other
simple
organisms
imbedded
in
granular
matter
here
and
there
however
this
hardened
mud
of
the
ancient
sea
reveals
the
remains
of
higher
animals
which
have
lived
and
died
and
left
their
hard
parts
in
the
mud
just
as
the
oysters
die
and
leave
their
shells
behind
them
in
the
mud
of
the
present
seas
there
are
at
the
present
day
certain
groups
of
animals
which
are
never
found
in
fresh
waters
being
unable
to
live
anywhere
but
in
the
sea
such
are
the
corals
those
corallines
which
are
called
those
creatures
which
fabricate
the
and
are
called
the
pearly
and
all
animals
allied
to
it
and
all
the
forms
of
and
not
only
are
all
these
creatures
confined
to
salt
water
at
the
present
day
but
so
far
as
our
records
of
the
past
go
the
conditions
of
their
existence
have
been
the
same
hence
their
occurrence
in
any
deposit
is
as
strong
evidence
as
can
be
obtained
that
that
deposit
was
formed
in
the
sea
now
the
remains
of
animals
of
all
the
kinds
which
have
been
enumerated
occur
in
the
chalk
in
greater
or
less
abundance
while
not
one
of
those
forms
of
which
are
characteristic
of
fresh
water
has
yet
been
observed
in
it
when
we
consider
that
the
remains
of
more
than
three
thousand
distinct
species
of
aquatic
animals
have
been
discovered
among
the
fossils
of
the
chalk
that
the
great
majority
of
them
are
of
such
forms
as
are
now
met
with
only
in
the
sea
and
that
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
any
one
of
them
inhabited
fresh
water
the
collateral
evidence
that
the
chalk
represents
an
ancient
acquires
as
great
force
as
the
proof
derived
from
the
nature
of
the
chalk
itself
i
think
you
will
now
allow
that
i
did
not
overstate
my
case
when
i
asserted
that
we
have
as
strong
grounds
for
believing
that
all
the
vast
area
of
dry
land
at
present
occupied
by
the
chalk
was
once
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
as
we
have
for
any
matter
of
history
whatever
while
there
is
no
justification
for
any
other
belief
no
less
certain
is
it
that
the
time
during
which
the
countries
we
now
call
england
france
germany
poland
russia
egypt
arabia
syria
were
more
or
less
completely
covered
by
a
deep
sea
was
of
considerable
duration
we
have
already
seen
that
the
chalk
is
in
places
more
than
a
thousand
feet
thick
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
must
have
taken
some
time
for
the
skeletons
of
animalcules
of
a
hundredth
of
an
inch
in
diameter
to
heap
up
such
a
mass
as
that
i
have
said
that
throughout
the
thickness
of
the
chalk
the
remains
of
other
animals
are
scattered
these
remains
are
often
in
the
most
exquisite
state
of
preservation
the
valves
of
the
are
commonly
adherent
the
long
spines
of
some
of
the
which
would
be
detached
by
the
smallest
jar
often
remain
in
their
places
in
a
word
it
is
certain
that
these
animals
have
lived
and
died
when
the
place
which
they
now
occupy
was
the
surface
of
as
much
of
the
chalk
as
had
then
been
deposited
and
that
each
has
been
covered
up
by
the
layer
of
mud
upon
which
the
creatures
imbedded
a
little
higher
up
have
in
like
manner
lived
and
died
but
some
of
these
remains
prove
the
existence
of
reptiles
of
vast
size
in
the
chalk
sea
these
lived
their
time
and
had
their
ancestors
and
descendants
which
assuredly
implies
time
reptiles
being
of
slow
growth
there
is
more
curious
evidence
again
that
the
process
of
covering
up
or
in
other
words
the
deposit
of
skeletons
did
not
go
on
very
fast
it
is
demonstrable
that
an
animal
of
the
cretaceous
sea
might
die
that
its
skeleton
might
lie
uncovered
upon
the
long
enough
to
lose
all
its
outward
coverings
and
appendages
by
putrefaction
and
that
after
this
had
happened
another
animal
might
attach
itself
to
the
dead
and
naked
skeleton
might
grow
to
maturity
and
might
itself
die
before
the
calcareous
mud
had
buried
the
whole
cases
of
this
kind
are
admirably
described
by
sir
charles
lyell
he
speaks
of
the
frequency
with
which
geologists
find
in
the
chalk
a
fossilized
to
which
is
attached
the
lower
valve
of
a
this
is
a
kind
of
with
a
shell
composed
of
two
pieces
of
which
as
in
the
oyster
one
is
fixed
and
the
other
free
the
upper
valve
is
almost
invariably
wanting
though
occasionally
found
in
a
perfect
state
of
preservation
in
the
white
chalk
at
some
distance
in
this
case
we
see
clearly
that
the
first
lived
from
youth
to
age
then
died
and
lost
its
spines
which
were
carried
away
then
the
young
adhered
to
the
bared
shell
grew
and
perished
in
its
turn
after
which
the
upper
valve
was
separated
from
the
lower
before
the
echinus
became
enveloped
in
chalky
mud
a
specimen
in
the
museum
of
practical
geology
in
london
still
further
prolongs
the
period
which
must
have
elapsed
between
the
death
of
the
and
its
burial
by
the
for
the
outward
face
of
the
valve
of
a
which
is
attached
to
a
is
itself
overrun
by
an
incrusting
coralline
which
spreads
thence
over
more
or
less
of
the
surface
of
the
it
follows
that
after
the
upper
valve
of
the
fell
off
the
surface
of
the
attached
valve
must
have
remained
exposed
long
enough
to
allow
of
the
growth
of
the
whole
coralline
since
corallines
do
not
live
imbedded
in
mud
the
progress
of
knowledge
may
one
day
enable
us
to
deduce
from
such
facts
as
these
the
maximum
rate
at
which
the
chalk
can
have
accumulated
and
thus
to
arrive
at
the
minimum
duration
of
the
chalk
period
suppose
that
the
valve
of
the
upon
which
a
coralline
has
fixed
itself
in
the
way
just
described
is
so
attached
to
the
that
no
part
of
it
is
more
than
an
inch
above
the
face
upon
which
the
rests
then
as
the
coralline
could
not
have
fixed
itself
if
the
had
been
covered
up
with
chalk
mud
and
could
not
have
lived
had
itself
been
so
covered
it
follows
that
an
inch
of
chalk
mud
could
not
have
accumulated
within
the
time
between
the
death
and
decay
of
the
soft
parts
of
the
and
the
growth
of
the
coralline
to
the
full
size
which
it
has
attained
if
the
decay
of
the
soft
parts
of
the
the
attachment
growth
to
maturity
and
decay
of
the
and
the
subsequent
attachment
and
growth
of
the
coralline
took
a
year
which
is
a
low
estimate
enough
the
accumulation
of
the
inch
of
chalk
must
have
taken
more
than
a
year
and
the
deposit
of
a
thousand
feet
of
chalk
must
consequently
have
taken
more
than
twelve
thousand
years
the
foundation
of
all
this
calculation
is
of
course
a
knowledge
of
the
length
of
time
the
and
the
coralline
needed
to
attain
their
full
size
and
on
this
head
precise
knowledge
is
at
present
wanting
but
there
are
circumstances
which
tend
to
show
that
nothing
like
an
inch
of
chalk
has
accumulated
during
the
life
of
a
and
on
any
probable
estimate
of
the
length
of
that
life
the
chalk
period
must
have
had
a
much
longer
duration
than
that
thus
roughly
assigned
to
it
thus
not
only
is
it
certain
that
the
chalk
is
the
mud
of
an
ancient
but
it
is
no
less
certain
that
the
chalk
sea
existed
during
an
extremely
long
period
though
we
may
not
be
prepared
to
give
a
precise
estimate
of
the
length
of
that
period
in
years
the
relative
duration
is
clear
though
the
absolute
duration
may
not
be
definable
the
attempt
to
affix
any
precise
date
to
the
period
at
which
the
chalk
sea
began
or
ended
its
existence
is
baffled
by
difficulties
of
the
same
kind
but
the
relative
age
of
the
cretaceous
epoch
may
be
determined
with
as
great
ease
and
certainty
as
the
long
duration
of
that
epoch
you
will
have
heard
of
the
interesting
discoveries
recently
made
in
various
parts
of
western
europe
of
flint
implements
obviously
worked
into
shape
by
human
hands
under
circumstances
which
show
conclusively
that
man
is
a
very
ancient
denizen
of
these
regions
it
has
been
proved
that
the
old
populations
of
europe
whose
existence
has
been
revealed
to
us
in
this
way
consisted
of
savages
such
as
the
esquimaux
are
now
that
in
the
country
which
is
now
france
they
hunted
the
reindeer
and
were
familiar
with
the
ways
of
the
mammoth
and
the
bison
the
physical
geography
of
france
was
in
those
days
different
from
what
it
is
now
the
river
somme
for
instance
having
cut
its
bed
a
hundred
feet
deeper
between
that
time
and
this
and
it
is
probable
that
the
climate
was
more
like
that
of
canada
or
siberia
than
that
of
western
europe
the
existence
of
these
people
is
forgotten
even
in
the
traditions
of
the
oldest
historical
nations
the
name
and
fame
of
them
had
utterly
vanished
until
a
few
years
back
and
the
amount
of
physical
change
which
has
been
effected
since
their
day
renders
it
more
than
probable
that
venerable
as
are
some
of
the
historical
nations
the
workers
of
the
chipped
flints
of
hoxne
or
of
amiens
are
to
them
as
they
are
to
us
in
point
of
antiquity
but
if
we
assign
to
these
hoar
relics
of
long
vanished
generations
of
men
the
greatest
age
that
can
possibly
be
claimed
for
them
they
are
not
older
than
the
drift
or
boulder
clay
which
in
comparison
with
the
chalk
is
but
a
very
juvenile
deposit
you
need
go
no
further
than
your
own
for
evidence
of
this
fact
at
one
of
the
most
charming
spots
on
the
coast
of
norfolk
cromer
you
will
see
the
boulder
clay
forming
a
vast
mass
which
lies
upon
the
chalk
and
must
consequently
have
come
into
existence
after
it
huge
boulders
of
chalk
are
in
fact
included
in
the
clay
and
have
evidently
been
brought
to
the
position
they
now
occupy
by
the
same
agency
as
that
which
has
planted
blocks
of
syenite
from
norway
side
by
side
with
them
the
chalk
then
is
certainly
older
than
the
boulder
clay
if
you
ask
how
much
i
will
again
take
you
no
further
than
the
same
spot
upon
your
own
coasts
for
evidence
i
have
spoken
of
the
boulder
clay
and
drift
as
resting
upon
the
chalk
that
is
not
strictly
true
interposed
between
the
chalk
and
the
drift
is
a
comparatively
insignificant
layer
containing
vegetable
matter
but
that
layer
tells
a
wonderful
history
it
is
full
of
stumps
of
trees
standing
as
they
grew
are
there
with
their
cones
and
with
their
nuts
there
stand
the
stools
of
oak
and
yew
trees
beeches
and
alders
hence
this
stratum
is
appropriately
called
the
it
is
obvious
that
the
chalk
must
have
been
upheaved
and
converted
into
dry
land
before
the
timber
trees
could
grow
upon
it
as
the
bolls
of
some
of
these
trees
are
from
two
to
three
feet
in
diameter
it
is
no
less
clear
that
the
dry
land
thus
formed
remained
in
the
same
condition
for
long
ages
and
not
only
do
the
remains
of
stately
oaks
and
firs
testify
to
the
duration
of
this
condition
of
things
but
additional
evidence
to
the
same
effect
is
afforded
by
the
abundant
remains
of
elephants
rhinoceroses
hippopotamuses
and
other
great
wild
beasts
which
it
has
yielded
to
the
zealous
search
of
such
men
as
the
rev
gunn
when
you
look
at
such
a
collection
as
he
has
formed
and
bethink
you
that
these
elephantine
bones
did
veritably
carry
their
owners
about
and
these
great
grinders
crunch
in
the
dark
woods
of
which
the
is
now
the
only
trace
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
that
they
are
as
good
evidence
of
the
lapse
of
time
as
the
annual
rings
of
the
thus
there
is
a
writing
upon
the
wall
of
cliffs
at
cromer
and
whoso
runs
may
read
it
it
tells
us
with
an
authority
which
can
not
be
impeached
that
the
ancient
of
the
chalk
sea
was
raised
up
and
remained
dry
land
until
it
was
covered
with
forest
stocked
with
the
great
game
whose
spoils
have
rejoiced
your
geologists
how
long
it
remained
in
that
condition
can
not
be
said
but
the
whirligig
of
time
brought
its
revenges
in
those
days
as
in
these
that
dry
land
with
the
bones
and
teeth
of
generations
of
elephants
hidden
away
among
the
gnarled
roots
and
dry
leaves
of
its
ancient
trees
sank
gradually
to
the
bottom
of
the
icy
sea
which
covered
it
with
huge
masses
of
drift
and
boulder
clay
such
as
the
walrus
now
restricted
to
the
extreme
north
paddled
about
where
birds
had
twittered
among
the
topmost
twigs
of
the
how
long
this
state
of
things
endured
we
know
not
but
at
length
it
came
to
an
end
the
upheaved
glacial
mud
hardened
into
the
soil
of
modern
norfolk
forests
grew
once
more
the
wolf
and
the
beaver
replaced
the
reindeer
and
the
elephant
and
at
length
what
we
call
the
history
of
england
dawned
thus
you
have
within
the
limits
of
your
own
county
proof
that
the
chalk
can
justly
claim
a
very
much
greater
antiquity
than
even
the
oldest
physical
traces
of
mankind
but
we
may
go
further
and
demonstrate
by
evidence
of
the
same
authority
as
that
which
testifies
to
the
existence
of
the
father
of
men
that
the
chalk
is
vastly
older
than
adam
himself
the
book
of
genesis
informs
us
that
adam
immediately
upon
his
creation
and
before
the
appearance
of
eve
was
placed
in
the
garden
of
eden
the
problem
of
the
geographical
position
of
eden
has
greatly
vexed
the
spirits
of
the
learned
in
such
matters
but
there
is
one
point
respecting
which
so
far
as
i
know
no
commentator
has
ever
raised
a
doubt
this
is
that
of
the
four
rivers
which
are
said
to
run
out
of
it
euphrates
and
hiddekel
are
identical
with
the
rivers
now
known
by
the
names
of
euphrates
and
tigris
but
the
whole
country
in
which
these
mighty
rivers
take
their
origin
and
through
which
they
run
is
composed
of
rocks
which
are
either
of
the
same
age
as
the
chalk
or
of
later
date
so
that
the
chalk
must
not
only
have
been
formed
but
after
its
formation
the
time
required
for
the
deposit
of
these
later
rocks
and
for
their
upheaval
into
dry
land
must
have
elapsed
before
the
smallest
brook
which
feeds
the
swift
stream
of
the
great
river
the
river
of
babylon
began
to
flow
thus
evidence
which
can
not
be
rebutted
and
which
need
not
be
strengthened
though
if
time
permitted
i
might
indefinitely
increase
its
quantity
compels
you
to
believe
that
the
earth
from
the
time
of
the
chalk
to
the
present
day
has
been
the
theatre
of
a
series
of
changes
as
vast
in
their
amount
as
they
were
slow
in
their
progress
the
area
on
which
we
stand
has
been
first
sea
and
then
land
for
at
least
four
alternations
and
has
remained
in
each
of
these
conditions
for
a
period
of
great
length
nor
have
these
wonderful
metamorphoses
of
sea
into
land
and
of
land
into
sea
been
confined
to
one
corner
of
england
during
the
chalk
period
or
cretaceous
epoch
not
one
of
the
present
great
physical
features
of
the
globe
was
in
existence
our
great
mountain
ranges
pyrenees
alps
himalayas
andes
have
all
been
upheaved
since
the
chalk
was
deposited
and
the
cretaceous
sea
flowed
over
the
sites
of
sinai
and
ararat
all
this
is
certain
because
rocks
of
cretaceous
or
still
later
date
have
shared
in
the
elevatory
movements
which
gave
rise
to
these
mountain
chains
and
may
be
found
perched
up
in
some
cases
many
thousand
feet
high
upon
their
flanks
and
evidence
of
equal
cogency
demonstrates
that
though
in
norfolk
the
rests
directly
upon
the
chalk
yet
it
does
so
not
because
the
period
at
which
the
forest
grew
immediately
followed
that
at
which
the
chalk
was
formed
but
because
an
immense
lapse
of
time
represented
elsewhere
by
thousands
of
feet
of
rock
is
not
indicated
at
cromer
i
must
ask
you
to
believe
that
there
is
no
less
conclusive
proof
that
a
still
more
prolonged
succession
of
similar
changes
occurred
before
the
chalk
was
deposited
nor
have
we
any
reason
to
think
that
the
first
term
in
the
series
of
these
changes
is
known
the
oldest
preserved
to
us
are
sands
and
mud
and
pebbles
the
wear
and
tear
of
rocks
which
were
formed
in
still
older
oceans
but
great
as
is
the
magnitude
of
these
physical
changes
of
the
world
they
have
been
accompanied
by
a
no
less
striking
series
of
modifications
in
its
living
inhabitants
all
the
great
classes
of
animals
beasts
of
the
field
fowls
of
the
air
creeping
things
and
things
which
dwell
in
the
waters
flourished
upon
the
globe
long
ages
before
the
chalk
was
deposited
very
few
however
if
any
of
these
ancient
forms
of
animal
life
were
identical
with
those
which
now
live
certainly
not
one
of
the
higher
animals
was
of
the
same
species
as
any
of
those
now
in
existence
the
beasts
of
the
field
in
the
days
before
the
chalk
were
not
our
beasts
of
the
field
nor
the
fowls
of
the
air
such
as
those
which
the
eye
of
men
has
seen
flying
unless
his
antiquity
dates
infinitely
further
back
than
we
at
present
surmise
if
we
could
be
carried
back
into
those
times
we
should
be
as
one
suddenly
set
down
in
australia
before
it
was
colonized
we
should
see
mammals
birds
reptiles
fishes
insects
snails
and
the
like
clearly
recognisable
as
such
and
yet
not
one
of
them
would
be
just
the
same
as
those
with
which
we
are
familiar
and
many
would
be
extremely
different
from
that
time
to
the
present
the
population
of
the
world
has
undergone
slow
and
gradual
but
incessant
changes
there
has
been
no
grand
catastrophe
no
destroyer
has
swept
away
the
forms
of
life
of
one
period
and
replaced
them
by
a
totally
new
creation
but
one
species
has
vanished
and
another
has
taken
its
place
creatures
of
one
type
of
structure
have
diminished
those
of
another
have
increased
as
time
has
passed
on
and
thus
while
the
differences
between
the
living
creatures
of
the
time
before
the
chalk
and
those
of
the
present
day
appear
startling
if
placed
side
by
side
we
are
led
from
one
to
the
other
by
the
most
gradual
progress
if
we
follow
the
course
of
nature
through
the
whole
series
of
those
relics
of
her
operations
which
she
has
left
behind
and
it
is
by
the
population
of
the
chalk
sea
that
the
ancient
and
the
modern
inhabitants
of
the
world
are
most
completely
connected
the
groups
which
are
dying
out
flourish
side
by
side
with
the
groups
which
are
now
the
dominant
forms
of
life
thus
the
chalk
contains
remains
of
those
strange
flying
and
swimming
reptiles
the
pterodactyl
the
ichthyosaurus
and
the
plesiosaurus
which
are
found
in
no
later
deposits
but
abounded
in
preceding
ages
the
chambered
shells
called
ammonites
and
belemnites
which
are
so
characteristic
of
the
period
preceding
the
cretaceous
in
like
manner
die
with
it
but
amongst
these
fading
remainders
of
a
previous
state
of
things
are
some
very
modern
forms
of
life
looking
like
yankee
pedlars
among
a
tribe
of
red
indians
crocodiles
of
modern
type
appear
bony
fishes
many
of
them
very
similar
to
existing
species
almost
supplant
the
forms
of
fish
which
predominate
in
more
ancient
seas
and
many
kinds
of
living
first
become
known
to
us
in
the
chalk
the
vegetation
acquires
a
modern
aspect
a
few
living
animals
are
not
even
distinguishable
as
species
from
those
which
existed
at
that
remote
epoch
the
of
the
present
day
for
example
is
not
different
specifically
from
that
of
the
chalk
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
many
other
i
think
it
probable
that
critical
and
unprejudiced
examination
will
show
that
more
than
one
species
of
much
higher
animals
have
had
a
similar
longevity
but
the
only
example
which
i
can
at
present
give
confidently
is
the
caput
which
lives
in
our
english
seas
and
abounded
as
of
authors
in
the
chalk
the
longest
line
of
human
ancestry
must
hide
its
diminished
head
before
the
pedigree
of
this
insignificant
we
englishmen
are
proud
to
have
an
ancestor
who
was
present
at
the
battle
of
hastings
the
ancestors
of
caput
may
have
been
present
at
a
battle
of
in
that
part
of
the
sea
which
when
the
chalk
was
forming
flowed
over
the
site
of
hastings
while
all
around
has
changed
this
has
peacefully
propagated
its
species
from
generation
to
generation
and
stands
to
this
day
as
a
living
testimony
to
the
continuity
of
the
present
with
the
past
history
of
the
globe
up
to
this
moment
i
have
stated
so
far
as
i
know
nothing
but
facts
and
the
immediate
conclusions
which
they
force
upon
the
mind
but
the
mind
is
so
constituted
that
it
does
not
willingly
rest
in
facts
and
immediate
causes
but
seeks
always
after
a
knowledge
of
the
remoter
links
in
the
chain
of
causation
taking
the
many
changes
of
any
given
spot
of
the
earth
surface
from
sea
to
land
and
from
land
to
sea
as
an
established
fact
we
can
not
refrain
from
asking
ourselves
how
these
changes
have
occurred
and
when
we
have
explained
them
as
they
must
be
explained
by
the
alternate
slow
movements
of
elevation
and
depression
which
have
affected
the
crust
of
the
earth
we
go
still
further
back
and
ask
why
these
movements
i
am
not
certain
that
any
one
can
give
you
a
satisfactory
answer
to
that
question
assuredly
i
can
not
all
that
can
be
said
for
certain
is
that
such
movements
are
part
of
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
inasmuch
as
they
are
going
on
at
the
present
time
direct
proof
may
be
given
that
some
parts
of
the
land
of
the
northern
hemisphere
are
at
this
moment
insensibly
rising
and
others
insensibly
sinking
and
there
is
indirect
but
perfectly
satisfactory
proof
that
an
enormous
area
now
covered
by
the
pacific
has
been
deepened
thousands
of
feet
since
the
present
inhabitants
of
that
sea
came
into
existence
thus
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
a
reason
for
believing
that
the
physical
changes
of
the
globe
in
past
times
have
been
effected
by
other
than
natural
causes
is
there
any
more
reason
for
believing
that
the
concomitant
modifications
in
the
forms
of
the
living
inhabitants
of
the
globe
have
been
brought
about
in
other
ways
before
attempting
to
answer
this
question
let
us
try
to
form
a
distinct
mental
picture
of
what
has
happened
in
some
special
case
the
crocodiles
are
animals
which
as
a
group
have
a
very
vast
antiquity
they
abounded
ages
before
the
chalk
was
deposited
they
throng
the
rivers
in
warm
climates
at
the
present
day
there
is
a
difference
in
the
form
of
the
joints
of
the
and
in
some
minor
particulars
between
the
crocodiles
of
the
present
epoch
and
those
which
lived
before
the
chalk
but
in
the
cretaceous
epoch
as
i
have
already
mentioned
the
crocodiles
had
assumed
the
modern
type
of
structure
notwithstanding
this
the
crocodiles
of
the
chalk
are
not
identically
the
same
as
those
which
lived
in
the
times
called
older
tertiary
which
succeeded
the
cretaceous
epoch
and
the
crocodiles
of
the
older
tertiaries
are
not
identical
with
those
of
the
newer
tertiaries
nor
are
these
identical
with
existing
forms
i
leave
open
the
question
whether
particular
species
may
have
lived
on
from
epoch
to
epoch
but
each
epoch
has
had
its
peculiar
crocodiles
though
all
since
the
chalk
have
belonged
to
the
modern
type
and
differ
simply
in
their
proportions
and
in
such
structural
particulars
as
are
discernible
only
to
trained
eyes
how
is
the
existence
of
this
long
succession
of
different
species
of
crocodiles
to
be
accounted
for
only
two
suppositions
seem
to
be
open
to
us
either
each
species
of
crocodile
has
been
specially
created
or
it
has
arisen
out
of
some
form
by
the
operation
of
natural
causes
choose
your
hypothesis
i
have
chosen
mine
i
can
find
no
warranty
for
believing
in
the
distinct
creation
of
a
score
of
successive
species
of
crocodiles
in
the
course
of
countless
ages
of
time
science
gives
no
countenance
to
such
a
wild
fancy
nor
can
even
the
perverse
ingenuity
of
a
commentator
pretend
to
discover
this
sense
in
the
simple
words
in
which
the
writer
of
genesis
records
the
proceedings
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
days
of
the
creation
on
the
other
hand
i
see
no
good
reason
for
doubting
the
necessary
alternative
that
all
these
varied
species
have
been
evolved
from
crocodilian
forms
by
the
operation
of
causes
as
completely
a
part
of
the
common
order
of
nature
as
those
which
have
effected
the
changes
of
the
inorganic
world
few
will
venture
to
affirm
that
the
reasoning
which
applies
to
crocodiles
loses
its
force
among
other
animals
or
among
plants
if
one
series
of
species
has
come
into
existence
by
the
operation
of
natural
causes
it
seems
folly
to
deny
that
all
may
have
arisen
in
the
same
way
a
small
beginning
has
led
us
to
a
great
ending
if
i
were
to
put
the
bit
of
chalk
with
which
we
started
into
the
hot
but
obscure
flame
of
burning
hydrogen
it
would
presently
shine
like
the
sun
it
seems
to
me
that
this
physical
metamorphosis
is
no
false
image
of
what
has
been
the
result
of
our
subjecting
it
to
a
jet
of
fervent
though
nowise
brilliant
thought
it
has
become
luminous
and
its
clear
rays
penetrating
the
abyss
of
the
remote
past
have
brought
within
our
ken
some
stages
of
the
evolution
of
the
earth
and
in
the
shifting
without
haste
but
without
rest
of
the
land
and
sea
as
in
the
endless
variation
of
the
forms
assumed
by
living
beings
we
have
observed
nothing
but
the
natural
product
of
the
forces
originally
possessed
by
the
substance
of
the
universe

for
an

in

into
the
nature
and
value
of
the
present
results
of
pal√¶ontological
investigation
and
the
more
so
as
all
those
who
have
paid
close
attention
to
the
late
multitudinous
discussions
in
which
pal√¶ontology
is
implicated
must
have
felt
the
urgent
necessity
of
some
such
scrutiny
first
in
order
as
the
most
definite
and
unquestionable
of
all
the
results
of
pal√¶ontology
must
be
mentioned
the
immense
extension
and
impulse
given
to
botany
zoology
and
comparative
anatomy
by
the
investigation
of
fossil
remains
indeed
the
mass
of
biological
facts
has
been
so
greatly
increased
and
the
range
of
biological
speculation
has
been
so
vastly
widened
by
the
researches
of
the
geologist
and
pal√¶ontologist
that
it
is
to
be
feared
there
are
naturalists
in
existence
who
look
upon
geology
as
brindley
regarded
rivers
rivers
said
the
great
engineer
were
made
to
feed
canals
and
geology
some
seem
to
think
was
solely
created
to
advance
comparative
anatomy
were
such
a
thought
justifiable
it
could
hardly
expect
to
be
received
with
favour
by
this
assembly
but
it
is
not
justifiable
your
favourite
science
has
her
own
great
aims
independent
of
all
others
and
if
notwithstanding
her
steady
devotion
to
her
own
progress
she
can
scatter
such
rich
alms
among
her
sisters
it
should
be
remembered
that
her
charity
is
of
the
sort
that
does
not
impoverish
but
blesseth
him
that
gives
and
him
that
takes
regard
the
matter
as
we
will
however
the
facts
remain
nearly
species
of
animals
and
plants
have
been
added
to
the
systema
natur√¶
by
pal√¶ontological
research
this
is
a
living
population
equivalent
to
that
of
a
new
continent
in
mere
number
equivalent
to
that
of
a
new
hemisphere
if
we
take
into
account
the
small
population
of
insects
as
yet
found
fossil
and
the
large
proportion
and
peculiar
organization
of
many
of
the
vertebrata
but
beyond
this
it
is
perhaps
not
too
much
to
say
that
except
for
the
necessity
of
interpreting
pal√¶ontological
facts
the
laws
of
distribution
would
have
received
less
careful
study
while
few
comparative
anatomists
and
those
not
of
the
first
order
would
have
been
induced
by
mere
love
of
detail
as
such
to
study
the
minuti√¶
of
osteology
were
it
not
that
in
such
minuti√¶
lie
the
only
keys
to
the
most
interesting
riddles
offered
by
the
extinct
animal
world
these
assuredly
are
great
and
solid
gains
surely
it
is
matter
for
no
small
congratulation
that
in
half
a
century
for
pal√¶ontology
though
it
dawned
earlier
came
into
full
day
only
with
cuvier
a
subordinate
branch
of
biology
should
have
doubled
the
value
and
the
interest
of
the
whole
group
of
sciences
to
which
it
belongs
but
this
is
not
all
allied
with
geology
pal√¶ontology
has
established
two
laws
of
inestimable
importance
the
first
that
one
and
the
same
area
of
the
earth
surface
has
been
successively
occupied
by
very
different
kinds
of
living
beings
the
second
that
the
order
of
succession
established
in
one
locality
holds
good
approximately
in
all
the
first
of
these
laws
is
universal
and
irreversible
the
second
is
an
induction
from
a
vast
number
of
observations
though
it
may
possibly
and
even
probably
have
to
admit
of
exceptions
as
a
consequence
of
the
second
law
it
follows
that
a
peculiar
relation
frequently
subsists
between
series
of
strata
containing
organic
remains
in
different
localities
the
series
resemble
one
another
not
only
in
virtue
of
a
general
resemblance
of
the
organic
remains
in
the
two
but
also
in
virtue
of
a
resemblance
in
the
order
and
character
of
the
serial
succession
in
each
there
is
a
resemblance
of
arrangement
so
that
the
separate
terms
of
each
series
as
well
as
the
whole
series
exhibit
a
correspondence
succession
implies
time
the
lower
members
of
a
series
of
sedimentary
rocks
are
certainly
older
than
the
upper
and
when
the
notion
of
age
was
once
introduced
as
the
equivalent
of
succession
it
was
no
wonder
that
correspondence
in
succession
came
to
be
looked
upon
as
correspondence
in
age
or
contemporaneity
and
indeed
so
long
as
relative
age
only
is
spoken
of
correspondence
in
succession
correspondence
in
age
it
is
contemporaneity
but
it
would
have
been
very
much
better
for
geology
if
so
loose
and
ambiguous
a
word
as
contemporaneous
had
been
excluded
from
her
terminology
and
if
in
its
stead
some
term
expressing
similarity
of
serial
relation
and
excluding
the
notion
of
time
altogether
had
been
employed
to
denote
correspondence
in
position
in
two
or
more
series
of
strata
in
anatomy
where
such
correspondence
of
position
has
constantly
to
be
spoken
of
it
is
denoted
by
the
word
homology
and
its
derivatives
and
for
geology
which
after
all
is
only
the
anatomy
and
physiology
of
the
earth
it
might
be
well
to
invent
some
single
word
such
as
homotaxis
similarity
of
order
in
order
to
express
an
essentially
similar
idea
this
however
has
not
been
done
and
most
probably
the
inquiry
will
at
once
be
made
to
what
end
burden
science
with
a
new
and
strange
term
in
place
of
one
old
familiar
and
part
of
our
common
language
the
reply
to
this
question
will
become
obvious
as
the
inquiry
into
the
results
of
pal√¶ontology
is
pushed
further
those
whose
business
it
is
to
acquaint
themselves
specially
with
the
works
of
pal√¶ontologists
in
fact
will
be
fully
aware
that
very
few
if
any
would
rest
satisfied
with
such
a
statement
of
the
conclusions
of
their
branch
of
biology
as
that
which
has
just
been
given
our
standard
repertories
of
pal√¶ontology
profess
to
teach
us
far
higher
things
to
disclose
the
entire
succession
of
living
forms
upon
the
surface
of
the
globe
to
tell
us
of
a
wholly
different
distribution
of
climatic
conditions
in
ancient
times
to
reveal
the
character
of
the
first
of
all
living
existences
and
to
trace
out
the
law
of
progress
from
them
to
us
it
may
not
be
unprofitable
to
bestow
on
these
professions
a
somewhat
more
critical
examination
than
they
have
hitherto
received
in
order
to
ascertain
how
far
they
rest
on
an
irrefragable
basis
or
whether
after
all
it
might
not
be
well
for
pal√¶ontologists
to
learn
a
little
more
carefully
that
scientific
ars
artium
the
art
of
saying
i
know
and
to
this
end
let
us
define
somewhat
more
exactly
the
extent
of
these
pretensions
of
pal√¶ontology
every
one
is
aware
that
professor
bronn
untersuchungen
and
professor
pictet
trait√©
de
pal√©ontologie
are
works
of
standard
authority
familiarly
consulted
by
every
working
pal√¶ontologist
it
is
desirable
to
speak
of
these
excellent
books
and
of
their
distinguished
authors
with
the
utmost
respect
and
in
a
tone
as
far
as
possible
removed
from
carping
criticism
indeed
if
they
are
specially
cited
in
this
place
it
is
merely
in
justification
of
the
assertion
that
the
following
propositions
which
may
be
found
implicitly
or
explicitly
in
the
works
in
question
are
regarded
by
the
mass
of
pal√¶ontologists
and
geologists
not
only
on
the
continent
but
in
this
country
as
expressing
some
of
the
results
of
pal√¶ontology
thus
animals
and
plants
began
their
existence
together
not
long
after
the
commencement
of
the
deposition
of
the
sedimentary
rocks
and
then
succeeded
one
another
in
such
a
manner
that
totally
distinct
faunas
and
flor√¶
occupied
the
whole
surface
of
the
earth
one
after
the
other
and
during
distinct
epochs
of
time
a
geological
formation
is
the
sum
of
all
the
strata
deposited
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
earth
during
one
of
these
epochs
a
geological
fauna
or
flora
is
the
sum
of
all
the
species
of
animals
or
plants
which
occupied
the
whole
surface
of
the
globe
during
one
of
these
epochs
the
population
of
the
earth
surface
was
at
first
very
similar
in
all
parts
and
only
from
the
middle
of
the
tertiary
epoch
onwards
began
to
show
a
distinct
distribution
in
zones
the
constitution
of
the
original
population
as
well
as
the
numerical
proportions
of
its
members
indicates
a
warmer
and
on
the
whole
somewhat
tropical
climate
which
remained
tolerably
equable
throughout
the
year
the
subsequent
distribution
of
living
beings
in
zones
is
the
result
of
a
gradual
lowering
of
the
general
temperature
which
first
began
to
be
felt
at
the
poles
it
is
not
now
proposed
to
inquire
whether
these
doctrines
are
true
or
false
but
to
direct
your
attention
to
a
much
simpler
though
very
essential
preliminary
question
what
is
their
logical
basis
what
are
the
fundamental
assumptions
upon
which
they
all
logically
depend
and
what
is
the
evidence
on
which
those
fundamental
propositions
demand
our
assent
these
assumptions
are
two
the
first
that
the
commencement
of
the
geological
record
is
coeval
with
the
commencement
of
life
on
the
globe
the
second
that
geological
contemporaneity
is
the
same
thing
as
chronological
synchrony
without
the
first
of
these
assumptions
there
would
of
course
be
no
ground
for
any
statement
respecting
the
commencement
of
life
without
the
second
all
the
other
statements
cited
every
one
of
which
implies
a
knowledge
of
the
state
of
different
parts
of
the
earth
at
one
and
the
same
time
will
be
no
less
devoid
of
demonstration
the
first
assumption
obviously
rests
entirely
on
negative
evidence
this
is
of
course
the
only
evidence
that
ever
can
be
available
to
prove
the
commencement
of
any
series
of
ph√¶nomena
but
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
recollected
that
the
value
of
negative
evidence
depends
entirely
on
the
amount
of
positive
corroboration
it
receives
if
wishes
to
prove
an
it
is
of
no
use
for
him
to
get
a
thousand
witnesses
simply
to
swear
that
they
did
not
see
him
in
such
and
such
a
place
unless
the
witnesses
are
prepared
to
prove
that
they
must
have
seen
him
had
he
been
there
but
the
evidence
that
animal
life
commenced
with
the
would
seem
to
be
exactly
of
this
unsatisfactory
uncorroborated
sort
the
cambrian
witnesses
simply
swear
they
seen
anybody
their
way
upon
which
the
counsel
for
the
other
side
immediately
puts
in
ten
or
twelve
thousand
feet
of
devonian
sandstones
to
make
oath
they
never
saw
a
fish
or
a
mollusk
though
all
the
world
knows
there
were
plenty
in
their
time
but
then
it
is
urged
that
though
the
devonian
rocks
in
one
part
of
the
world
exhibit
no
fossils
in
another
they
do
while
the
lower
cambrian
rocks
nowhere
exhibit
fossils
and
hence
no
living
being
could
have
existed
in
their
epoch
to
this
there
are
two
replies
the
first
that
the
observational
basis
of
the
assertion
that
the
lowest
rocks
are
nowhere
fossiliferous
is
an
amazingly
small
one
seeing
how
very
small
an
area
in
comparison
to
that
of
the
whole
world
has
yet
been
fully
searched
the
second
that
the
argument
is
good
for
nothing
unless
the
unfossiliferous
rocks
in
question
were
not
only
in
the
geological
sense
but
in
the
chronological
sense
to
use
the
illustration
again
if
a
man
wishes
to
prove
he
was
in
neither
of
two
places
a
and
b
on
a
given
day
his
witnesses
for
each
place
must
be
prepared
to
answer
for
the
whole
day
if
they
can
only
prove
that
he
was
not
at
a
in
the
morning
and
not
at
b
in
the
afternoon
the
evidence
of
his
absence
from
both
is
because
he
might
have
been
at
b
in
the
morning
and
at
a
in
the
afternoon
thus
everything
depends
upon
the
validity
of
the
second
assumption
and
we
must
proceed
to
inquire
what
is
the
real
meaning
of
the
word
contemporaneous
as
employed
by
geologists
to
this
end
a
concrete
example
may
be
taken
the
lias
of
england
and
the
lias
of
germany
the
cretaceous
rocks
of
britain
and
the
cretaceous
rocks
of
southern
india
are
termed
by
geologists
contemporaneous
formations
but
whenever
any
thoughtful
geologist
is
asked
whether
he
means
to
say
that
they
were
deposited
synchronously
he
says
no
only
within
the
same
great
epoch
and
if
in
pursuing
the
inquiry
he
is
asked
what
may
be
the
approximate
value
in
time
of
a
great
epoch
whether
it
means
a
hundred
years
or
a
thousand
or
a
million
or
ten
million
years
his
reply
is
i
can
not
tell
if
the
further
question
be
put
whether
physical
geology
is
in
possession
of
any
method
by
which
the
actual
synchrony
or
the
reverse
of
any
two
distant
deposits
can
be
ascertained
no
such
method
can
be
heard
of
it
being
admitted
by
all
the
best
authorities
that
neither
similarity
of
mineral
composition
nor
of
physical
character
nor
even
direct
continuity
of
stratum
are
proofs
of
the
synchronism
of
even
approximated
sedimentary
strata
while
for
distant
deposits
there
seems
to
be
no
kind
of
physical
evidence
attainable
of
a
nature
competent
to
decide
whether
such
deposits
were
formed
simultaneously
or
whether
they
possess
any
given
difference
of
antiquity
to
return
to
an
example
already
given
all
competent
authorities
will
probably
assent
to
the
proposition
that
physical
geology
does
not
enable
us
in
any
way
to
reply
to
this
question
were
the
british
cretaceous
rocks
deposited
at
the
same
time
as
those
of
india
or
are
they
a
million
of
years
younger
or
a
million
of
years
older
is
pal√¶ontology
able
to
succeed
where
physical
geology
fails
standard
writers
on
pal√¶ontology
as
has
been
seen
assume
that
she
can
they
take
it
for
granted
that
deposits
containing
similar
organic
remains
are
synchronous
at
any
rate
in
a
broad
sense
and
yet
those
who
will
study
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
chapters
of
sir
henry
de
la
remarkable
researches
in
theoretical
geology
published
now
nearly
thirty
years
ago
and
will
carry
out
the
arguments
there
most
luminously
stated
to
their
logical
consequences
may
very
easily
convince
themselves
that
even
absolute
identity
of
organic
contents
is
no
proof
of
the
synchrony
of
deposits
while
absolute
diversity
is
no
proof
of
difference
of
date
sir
henry
de
la
beche
goes
even
further
and
adduces
conclusive
evidence
to
show
that
the
different
parts
of
one
and
the
same
stratum
having
a
similar
composition
throughout
containing
the
same
organic
remains
and
having
similar
beds
above
and
below
it
may
yet
differ
to
any
conceivable
extent
in
age
edward
forbes
was
in
the
habit
of
asserting
that
the
similarity
of
the
organic
contents
of
distant
formations
was
evidence
not
of
their
similarity
but
of
their
difference
of
age
and
holding
as
he
did
the
doctrine
of
single
specific
centres
the
conclusion
was
as
legitimate
as
any
other
for
the
two
districts
must
have
been
occupied
by
migration
from
one
of
the
two
or
from
an
intermediate
spot
and
the
chances
against
exact
coincidence
of
migration
and
of
imbedding
are
infinite
in
point
of
fact
however
whether
the
hypothesis
of
single
or
of
multiple
specific
centres
be
adopted
similarity
of
organic
contents
can
not
possibly
afford
any
proof
of
the
synchrony
of
the
deposits
which
contain
them
on
the
contrary
it
is
demonstrably
compatible
with
the
lapse
of
the
most
prodigious
intervals
of
time
and
with
interposition
of
vast
changes
in
the
organic
and
inorganic
worlds
between
the
epochs
in
which
such
deposits
were
formed
on
what
amount
of
similarity
of
their
faun√¶
is
the
doctrine
of
the
contemporaneity
of
the
european
and
of
the
north
american
silurians
based
in
the
last
edition
of
sir
charles
lyell
elementary
geology
it
is
stated
on
the
authority
of
a
former
president
of
this
society
the
late
daniel
sharpe
that
between
and
per
cent
of
the
species
of
silurian
mollusca
are
common
to
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
by
way
of
due
allowance
for
further
discovery
let
us
double
the
lesser
number
and
suppose
that
per
cent
of
the
species
are
common
to
the
north
american
and
the
british
silurians
sixty
per
cent
of
species
in
common
is
then
proof
of
contemporaneity
now
suppose
that
a
million
or
two
of
years
hence
when
britain
has
made
another
dip
beneath
the
sea
and
has
come
up
again
some
geologist
applies
this
doctrine
in
comparing
the
strata
laid
bare
by
the
upheaval
of
the
bottom
say
of
george
channel
with
what
may
then
remain
of
the
suffolk
crag
reasoning
in
the
same
way
he
will
at
once
decide
the
suffolk
crag
and
the
george
channel
beds
to
be
contemporaneous
although
we
happen
to
know
that
a
vast
period
even
in
the
geological
sense
of
time
and
physical
changes
of
almost
unprecedented
extent
separate
the
two
but
if
it
be
a
demonstrable
fact
that
strata
containing
more
than
or
per
cent
of
species
of
mollusca
in
common
and
comparatively
close
together
may
yet
be
separated
by
an
amount
of
geological
time
sufficient
to
allow
of
some
of
the
greatest
physical
changes
the
world
has
seen
what
becomes
of
that
sort
of
contemporaneity
the
sole
evidence
of
which
is
a
similarity
of
facies
or
the
identity
of
half
a
dozen
species
or
of
a
good
many
genera
and
yet
there
is
no
better
evidence
for
the
contemporaneity
assumed
by
all
who
adopt
the
hypotheses
of
universal
faun√¶
and
flor√¶
of
a
universally
uniform
climate
and
of
a
sensible
cooling
of
the
globe
during
geological
time
there
seems
then
no
escape
from
the
admission
that
neither
physical
geology
nor
pal√¶ontology
possesses
any
method
by
which
the
absolute
synchronism
of
two
strata
can
be
demonstrated
all
that
geology
can
prove
is
local
order
of
succession
it
is
mathematically
certain
that
in
any
given
vertical
linear
section
of
an
undisturbed
series
of
sedimentary
deposits
the
bed
which
lies
lowest
is
the
oldest
in
any
other
vertical
linear
section
of
the
same
series
of
course
corresponding
beds
will
occur
in
a
similar
order
but
however
great
may
be
the
probability
no
man
can
say
with
absolute
certainty
that
the
beds
in
the
two
sections
were
synchronously
deposited
for
areas
of
moderate
extent
it
is
doubtless
true
that
no
practical
evil
is
likely
to
result
from
assuming
the
corresponding
beds
to
be
synchronous
or
strictly
contemporaneous
and
there
are
multitudes
of
accessory
circumstances
which
may
fully
justify
the
assumption
of
such
synchrony
but
the
moment
the
geologist
has
to
deal
with
large
areas
or
with
completely
separated
deposits
the
mischief
of
confounding
that
homotaxis
or
similarity
of
arrangement
which
be
demonstrated
with
synchrony
or
identity
of
date
for
which
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
proof
under
the
one
common
term
of
contemporaneity
becomes
incalculable
and
proves
the
constant
source
of
gratuitous
speculations
for
anything
that
geology
or
pal√¶ontology
are
able
to
show
to
the
contrary
a
devonian
fauna
and
flora
in
the
british
islands
may
have
been
contemporaneous
with
silurian
life
in
north
america
and
with
a
carboniferous
fauna
and
flora
in
africa
geographical
provinces
and
zones
may
have
been
as
distinctly
marked
in
the
pal√¶ozoic
epoch
as
at
present
and
those
seemingly
sudden
appearances
of
new
genera
and
species
which
we
ascribe
to
new
creation
may
be
simple
results
of
migration
it
may
be
so
it
may
be
otherwise
in
the
present
condition
of
our
knowledge
and
of
our
methods
one
verdict
not
proven
and
not
proveable
must
be
recorded
against
all
the
grand
hypotheses
of
the
pal√¶ontologist
respecting
the
general
succession
of
life
on
the
globe
the
order
and
nature
of
terrestrial
life
as
a
whole
are
open
questions
geology
at
present
provides
us
with
most
valuable
topographical
records
but
she
has
not
the
means
of
working
them
up
into
a
universal
history
is
such
a
universal
history
then
to
be
regarded
as
unattainable
are
all
the
grandest
and
most
interesting
problems
which
offer
themselves
to
the
geological
student
essentially
insoluble
is
he
in
the
position
of
a
scientific
tantalus
doomed
always
to
thirst
for
a
knowledge
which
he
can
not
obtain
the
reverse
is
to
be
hoped
nay
it
may
not
be
impossible
to
indicate
the
source
whence
help
will
come
in
commencing
these
remarks
mention
was
made
of
the
great
obligations
under
which
the
naturalist
lies
to
the
geologist
and
pal√¶ontologist
assuredly
the
time
will
come
when
these
obligations
will
be
repaid
tenfold
and
when
the
maze
of
the
world
past
history
through
which
the
pure
geologist
and
the
pure
pal√¶ontologist
find
no
guidance
will
be
securely
threaded
by
the
clue
furnished
by
the
naturalist
all
who
are
competent
to
express
an
opinion
on
the
subject
are
at
present
agreed
that
the
manifold
varieties
of
animal
and
vegetable
form
have
not
either
come
into
existence
by
chance
nor
result
from
capricious
exertions
of
creative
power
but
that
they
have
taken
place
in
a
definite
order
the
statement
of
which
order
is
what
men
of
science
term
a
natural
law
whether
such
a
law
is
to
be
regarded
as
an
expression
of
the
mode
of
operation
of
natural
forces
or
whether
it
is
simply
a
statement
of
the
manner
in
which
a
supernatural
power
has
thought
fit
to
act
is
a
secondary
question
so
long
as
the
existence
of
the
law
and
the
possibility
of
its
discovery
by
the
human
intellect
are
granted
but
he
must
be
a
philosopher
who
believing
in
that
possibility
and
having
watched
the
gigantic
strides
of
the
biological
sciences
during
the
last
twenty
years
doubts
that
science
will
sooner
or
later
make
this
further
step
so
as
to
become
possessed
of
the
law
of
evolution
of
organic
forms
of
the
unvarying
order
of
that
great
chain
of
causes
and
effects
of
which
all
organic
forms
ancient
and
modern
are
the
links
and
then
if
ever
we
shall
be
able
to
begin
to
discuss
with
profit
the
questions
respecting
the
commencement
of
life
and
the
nature
of
the
successive
populations
of
the
globe
which
so
many
seem
to
think
are
already
answered
the
preceding
arguments
make
no
particular
claim
to
novelty
indeed
they
have
been
floating
more
or
less
distinctly
before
the
minds
of
geologists
for
the
last
thirty
years
and
if
at
the
present
time
it
has
seemed
desirable
to
give
them
more
definite
and
systematic
expression
it
is
because
pal√¶ontology
is
every
day
assuming
a
greater
importance
and
now
requires
to
rest
on
a
basis
the
firmness
of
which
is
thoroughly
well
assured
among
its
fundamental
conceptions
there
must
be
no
confusion
between
what
is
certain
and
what
is
more
or
less
probable
but
pending
the
construction
of
a
surer
foundation
than
pal√¶ontology
now
possesses
it
may
be
instructive
assuming
for
the
nonce
the
general
correctness
of
the
ordinary
hypothesis
of
geological
contemporaneity
to
consider
whether
the
deductions
which
are
ordinarily
drawn
from
the
whole
body
of
pal√¶ontological
facts
are
justifiable
the
evidence
on
which
such
conclusions
are
based
is
of
two
kinds
negative
and
positive
the
value
of
negative
evidence
in
connexion
with
this
inquiry
has
been
so
fully
and
clearly
discussed
in
an
address
from
the
chair
of
this
society
which
none
of
us
have
forgotten
that
nothing
need
at
present
be
said
about
it
the
more
as
the
considerations
which
have
been
laid
before
you
have
certainly
not
tended
to
increase
your
estimation
of
such
evidence
it
will
be
preferable
to
turn
to
the
positive
facts
of
pal√¶ontology
and
to
inquire
what
they
tell
us
we
are
all
accustomed
to
speak
of
the
number
and
the
extent
of
the
changes
in
the
living
population
of
the
globe
during
geological
time
as
something
enormous
and
indeed
they
are
so
if
we
regard
only
the
negative
differences
which
separate
the
older
rocks
from
the
more
modern
and
if
we
look
upon
specific
and
generic
changes
as
great
changes
which
from
one
point
of
view
they
truly
are
but
leaving
the
negative
differences
out
of
consideration
and
looking
only
at
the
positive
data
furnished
by
the
fossil
world
from
a
broader
point
of
view
from
that
of
the
comparative
anatomist
who
has
made
the
study
of
the
greater
modifications
of
animal
form
his
chief
business
a
surprise
of
another
kind
dawns
upon
the
mind
and
under
aspect
the
smallness
of
the
total
change
becomes
as
astonishing
as
was
its
greatness
under
the
other
there
are
two
hundred
known
orders
of
plants
of
these
not
one
is
certainly
known
to
exist
exclusively
in
the
fossil
state
the
whole
lapse
of
geological
time
has
as
yet
yielded
not
a
single
new
ordinal
type
of
vegetable
structure
the
positive
change
in
passing
from
the
recent
to
the
ancient
animal
world
is
greater
but
still
singularly
small
no
fossil
animal
is
so
distinct
from
those
now
living
as
to
require
to
be
arranged
even
in
a
separate
class
from
those
which
contain
existing
forms
it
is
only
when
we
come
to
the
orders
which
may
be
roughly
estimated
at
about
a
hundred
and
thirty
that
we
meet
with
fossil
animals
so
distinct
from
those
now
living
as
to
require
orders
for
themselves
and
these
do
not
amount
on
the
most
liberal
estimate
to
more
than
about
per
cent
of
the
whole
there
is
no
certainly
known
extinct
order
of
protozoa
there
is
but
one
among
the
that
of
the
rugose
corals
there
is
none
among
the
mollusca
there
are
three
the
cystidea
blastoidea
and
edrioasterida
among
the
echinoderms
and
two
the
trilobita
and
eurypterida
among
the
crustacea
making
altogether
five
for
the
great
of
annulosa
among
vertebrates
there
is
no
ordinally
distinct
fossil
fish
there
is
only
one
extinct
order
of
amphibia
the
labyrinthodonts
but
there
are
at
least
four
distinct
orders
of
reptilia
viz
the
ichthyosauria
plesiosauria
pterosauria
dinosauria
and
perhaps
another
or
two
there
is
no
known
extinct
order
of
birds
and
no
certainly
known
extinct
order
of
mammals
the
ordinal
distinctness
of
the
toxodontia
being
doubtful
the
objection
that
broad
statements
of
this
kind
after
all
rest
largely
on
negative
evidence
is
obvious
but
it
has
less
force
than
may
at
first
be
supposed
for
as
might
be
expected
from
the
circumstances
of
the
case
we
possess
more
abundant
positive
evidence
regarding
fishes
and
marine
mollusks
than
respecting
any
other
forms
of
animal
life
and
yet
these
offer
us
through
the
whole
range
of
geological
time
no
species
ordinarily
distinct
from
those
now
living
while
the
far
less
numerous
class
of
echinoderms
presents
three
and
the
crustacea
two
such
orders
though
none
of
these
come
down
later
than
the
pal√¶ozoic
age
lastly
the
reptilia
present
the
extraordinary
and
exceptional
ph√¶nomenon
of
as
many
extinct
as
existing
orders
if
not
more
the
four
mentioned
maintaining
their
existence
from
the
lias
to
the
chalk
inclusive
some
years
ago
one
of
your
secretaries
pointed
out
another
kind
of
positive
pal√¶ontological
evidence
tending
towards
the
same
conclusion
afforded
by
the
existence
of
what
he
termed
persistent
types
of
vegetable
and
of
animal
life
he
stated
on
the
authority
of
hooker
that
there
are
carboniferous
plants
which
appear
to
be
generically
identical
with
some
now
living
that
the
cone
of
the
oolitic
is
hardly
distinguishable
from
that
of
an
existing
species
that
a
true
appears
in
the
purbecks
and
a
in
the
chalk
while
from
the
bagshot
sands
a
the
wood
of
which
is
not
distinguishable
from
that
of
species
now
living
in
australia
had
been
obtained
turning
to
the
animal
kingdom
he
affirmed
the
tabulate
corals
of
the
silurian
rocks
to
be
wonderfully
like
those
which
now
exist
while
even
the
families
of
the
aporosa
were
all
represented
in
the
older
mesozoic
rocks
among
the
mollusca
similar
facts
were
adduced
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
that
and
all
of
which
are
existing
are
given
without
a
doubt
as
silurian
in
the
last
edition
of
siluria
while
the
highest
forms
of
the
highest
cephalopods
are
represented
in
the
lias
by
a
genus
which
presents
the
closest
relation
to
the
existing
the
two
highest
groups
of
the
annulosa
the
insecta
and
the
arachnida
are
represented
in
the
coal
either
by
existing
genera
or
by
forms
differing
from
existing
genera
in
quite
minor
peculiarities
turning
to
the
vertebrata
the
only
pal√¶ozoic
elasmobranch
fish
of
which
we
have
any
complete
knowledge
is
the
devonian
and
carboniferous
which
differs
no
more
from
existing
sharks
than
these
do
from
one
another
again
vast
as
is
the
number
of
undoubtedly
ganoid
fossil
fishes
and
great
as
is
their
range
in
time
a
large
mass
of
evidence
has
recently
been
adduced
to
show
that
almost
all
those
respecting
which
we
possess
sufficient
information
are
referable
to
the
same
groups
as
the
existing
and
sturgeon
and
that
a
singular
relation
obtains
between
the
older
and
the
younger
fishes
the
former
the
devonian
ganoids
being
almost
all
members
of
the
same
as
while
the
mesozoic
ganoids
are
almost
all
similarly
allied
to
again
what
can
be
more
remarkable
than
the
singular
constancy
of
structure
preserved
throughout
a
vast
period
of
time
by
the
family
of
the
pycnodonts
and
by
that
of
the
true
coelacanths
the
former
persisting
with
but
insignificant
modifications
from
the
carboniferous
to
the
tertiary
rocks
inclusive
the
latter
existing
with
still
less
change
from
the
carboniferous
rocks
to
the
chalk
inclusive
among
reptiles
the
highest
living
group
that
of
the
crocodilia
is
represented
at
the
early
part
of
the
mesozoic
epoch
by
species
identical
in
the
essential
characters
of
their
organization
with
those
now
living
and
differing
from
the
latter
only
in
such
matters
as
the
form
of
the
articular
facets
of
the
vertebral
centra
in
the
extent
to
which
the
nasal
passages
are
separated
from
the
cavity
of
the
mouth
by
bone
and
in
the
proportions
of
the
limbs
and
even
as
regards
the
mammalia
the
scanty
remains
of
triassic
and
oolitic
species
afford
no
foundation
for
the
supposition
that
the
organization
of
the
oldest
forms
differed
nearly
so
much
from
some
of
those
which
now
live
as
these
differ
from
one
another
it
is
needless
to
multiply
these
instances
enough
has
been
said
to
justify
the
statement
that
in
view
of
the
immense
diversity
of
known
animal
and
vegetable
forms
and
the
enormous
lapse
of
time
indicated
by
the
accumulation
of
fossiliferous
strata
the
only
circumstance
to
be
wondered
at
is
not
that
the
changes
of
life
as
exhibited
by
positive
evidence
have
been
so
great
but
that
they
have
been
so
small
be
they
great
or
small
however
it
is
desirable
to
attempt
to
estimate
them
let
us
therefore
take
each
great
division
of
the
animal
world
in
succession
and
whenever
an
order
or
a
family
can
be
shown
to
have
had
a
prolonged
existence
let
us
endeavour
to
ascertain
how
far
the
later
members
of
the
group
differ
from
the
earlier
ones
if
these
later
members
in
all
or
in
many
cases
exhibit
a
certain
amount
of
modification
the
fact
is
so
far
evidence
in
favour
of
a
general
law
of
change
and
in
a
rough
way
the
rapidity
of
that
change
will
be
measured
by
the
demonstrable
amount
of
modification
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
recollected
that
the
absence
of
any
modification
while
it
may
leave
the
doctrine
of
the
existence
of
a
law
of
change
without
positive
support
can
not
possibly
disprove
all
forms
of
that
doctrine
though
it
may
afford
a
sufficient
refutation
of
many
of
them
the
the
protozoa
are
represented
throughout
the
whole
range
of
geological
series
from
the
lower
silurian
formation
to
the
present
day
the
most
ancient
forms
recently
made
known
by
ehrenberg
are
exceedingly
like
those
which
now
exist
no
one
has
ever
pretended
that
the
difference
between
any
ancient
and
any
modern
foraminifera
is
of
more
than
generic
value
nor
are
the
oldest
foraminifera
either
simpler
more
embryonic
or
less
differentiated
than
the
existing
forms
the
the
tabulate
corals
have
existed
from
the
silurian
epoch
to
the
present
day
but
i
am
not
aware
that
the
ancient
possesses
a
single
mark
of
a
more
embryonic
or
less
differentiated
character
or
less
high
organization
than
the
existing
as
for
the
aporose
corals
in
what
respect
is
the
silurian
less
highly
organized
or
more
embryonic
than
the
modern
or
the
liassic
aporosa
than
the
existing
members
of
the

families
the
in
what
sense
is
the
living
less
embryonic
or
more
specialized
than
the
pal√¶ozoic
or
the
existing
than
the
silurian
species
of
the
same
genera
in
what
sense
can
or
be
said
to
be
more
specialized
or
less
embryonic
than
or
the
modern
species
of
lamellibranch
and
gasteropod
genera
than
the
silurian
species
of
the
same
genera
the
the
carboniferous
insecta
and
arachnida
are
neither
less
specialized
nor
more
embryonic
than
those
that
now
live
nor
are
the
liassic
cirripedia
and
macrura
while
several
of
the
brachyura
which
appear
in
the
chalk
belong
to
existing
genera
and
none
exhibit
either
an
intermediate
or
an
embryonic
character
the
among
fishes
i
have
referred
to
the
coelacanthini
comprising
the
genera
and
as
affording
an
example
of
a
persistent
type
and
it
is
most
remarkable
to
note
the
smallness
of
the
differences
between
any
of
these
fishes
affecting
at
most
the
proportions
of
the
body
and
fins
and
the
character
and
sculpture
of
the
scales
notwithstanding
their
enormous
range
in

in
all
the
essentials
of
its
very
peculiar
structure
the
of
the
chalk
is
identical
with
the
of
the
coal
look
at
the
genus
again
persisting
without
a
modification
of
importance
from
the
liassic
to
the
eocene
formations
inclusive
or
among
the
teleostei
in
what
respect
is
the
of
the
chalk
more
embryonic
or
less
differentiated
than
of
king
george
sound
or
to
turn
to
the
higher
vertebrata
in
what
sense
are
the
liassic
chelonia
inferior
to
those
which
now
exist
how
are
the
cretaceous
ichthyosauria
plesiosauria
or
pterosauria
less
embryonic
or
more
differentiated
species
than
those
of
the
lias
or
lastly
in
what
circumstance
is
the
more
embryonic
or
of
a
more
generalized
type
than
the
modern
opossum
or
a
or
a
than
a
modern
or
these
examples
might
be
almost
indefinitely
multiplied
but
surely
they
are
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
only
safe
and
unquestionable
testimony
we
can
procure
positive
evidence
fails
to
demonstrate
any
sort
of
progressive
modification
towards
a
less
embryonic
or
less
generalized
type
in
a
great
many
groups
of
animals
of
geological
existence
in
these
groups
there
is
abundant
evidence
of
variation
none
of
what
is
ordinarily
understood
as
progression
and
if
the
known
geological
record
is
to
be
regarded
as
even
any
considerable
fragment
of
the
whole
it
is
inconceivable
that
any
theory
of
a
necessarily
progressive
development
can
stand
for
the
numerous
orders
and
families
cited
afford
no
trace
of
such
a
process
but
it
is
a
most
remarkable
fact
that
while
the
groups
which
have
been
mentioned
and
many
besides
exhibit
no
sign
of
progressive
modification
there
are
others
coexisting
with
them
under
the
same
conditions
in
which
more
or
less
distinct
indications
of
such
a
process
seem
to
be
traceable
among
such
indications
i
may
remind
you
of
the
predominance
of
holostome
gasteropoda
in
the
older
rocks
as
compared
with
that
of
siphonostome
gasteropoda
in
the
later
a
case
less
open
to
the
objection
of
negative
evidence
however
is
that
afforded
by
the
tetrabranchiate
cephalopoda
the
forms
of
the
shells
and
of
the
septal
sutures
exhibiting
a
certain
increase
of
complexity
in
the
newer
genera
here
however
one
is
met
at
once
with
the
occurrence
of
and
at
the
two
ends
of
the
series
and
of
the
fact
that
one
of
the
simplest
genera
is
that
which
now
exists
the
crinoidea
in
the
abundance
of
stalked
forms
in
the
ancient
formations
as
compared
with
their
present
rarity
seem
to
present
us
with
a
fair
case
of
modification
from
a
more
embryonic
towards
a
less
embryonic
condition
but
then
on
careful
consideration
of
the
facts
the
objection
arises
that
the
stalk
calyx
and
arms
of
the
pal√¶ozoic
crinoid
are
exceedingly
different
from
the
corresponding
organs
of
a
larval
and
it
might
with
perfect
justice
be
argued
that
and
for
example
depart
to
the
full
as
widely
in
one
direction
from
the
stalked
embryo
of
as
itself
does
in
the
other
the
echinidea
again
are
frequently
quoted
as
exhibiting
a
gradual
passage
from
a
more
generalized
to
a
more
specialized
type
seeing
that
the
elongated
or
oval
spatangoids
appear
after
the
spheroidal
echinoids
but
here
it
might
be
argued
on
the
other
hand
that
the
spheroidal
echinoids
in
reality
depart
further
from
the
general
plan
and
from
the
embryonic
form
than
the
elongated
spatangoids
do
and
that
the
peculiar
dental
apparatus
and
the
pedicellari√¶
of
the
former
are
marks
of
at
least
as
great
differentiation
as
the
petaloid
ambulacra
and
semit√¶
of
the
latter
once
more
the
prevalence
of
macrurous
before
brachyurous
podophthalmia
is
apparently
a
fair
piece
of
evidence
in
favour
of
progressive
modification
in
the
same
order
of
crustacea
and
yet
the
case
will
not
stand
much
sifting
seeing
that
the
macrurous
podophthalmia
depart
as
far
in
one
direction
from
the
common
type
of
podophthalmia
or
from
any
embryonic
condition
of
the
brachyura
as
the
brachyura
do
in
the
other
and
that
the
middle
terms
between
macrura
and
brachyura
the
anomura
are
little
better
represented
in
the
older
mesozoic
rocks
than
the
brachyura
are
none
of
the
cases
of
progressive
modification
which
are
cited
from
among
the
invertebrata
appear
to
me
to
have
a
foundation
less
open
to
criticism
than
these
and
if
this
be
so
no
careful
reasoner
would
i
think
be
inclined
to
lay
very
great
stress
upon
them
among
the
vertebrata
however
there
are
a
few
examples
which
appear
to
be
far
less
open
to
objection
it
is
in
fact
true
of
several
groups
of
vertebrata
which
have
lived
through
a
considerable
range
of
time
that
the
endoskeleton
more
particularly
the
spinal
column
of
the
older
genera
presents
a
less
ossified
and
so
far
less
differentiated
condition
than
that
of
the
younger
genera
thus
the
devonian
ganoids
though
almost
all
members
of
the
same
as
and
presenting
numerous
important
resemblances
to
the
existing
genus
which
possesses
biconcave
vertebr√¶
are
for
the
most
part
wholly
devoid
of
ossified
vertebral
centra
the
mesozoic
lepidosteid√¶
again
have
at
most
biconcave
vertebr√¶
while
the
existing
has
salamandroid
opisthocoelous
vertebr√¶
so
none
of
the
pal√¶ozoic
sharks
have
shown
themselves
to
be
possessed
of
ossified
vertebr√¶
while
the
majority
of
modern
sharks
possess
such
vertebr√¶
again
the
more
ancient
crocodilia
and
lacertilia
have
vertebr√¶
with
the
articular
facets
of
their
centra
flattened
or
biconcave
while
the
modern
members
of
the
same
group
have
them
procoelous
but
the
most
remarkable
examples
of
progressive
modification
of
the
vertebral
column
in
correspondence
with
geological
age
are
those
afforded
by
the
pycnodonts
among
fish
and
the
labyrinthodonts
among
amphibia
the
late
able
ichthyologist
heckel
pointed
out
the
fact
that
while
the
pycnodonts
never
possess
true
vertebral
centra
they
differ
in
the
degree
of
expansion
and
extension
of
the
ends
of
the
bony
arches
of
the
vertebr√¶
upon
the
sheath
of
the
notochord
the
carboniferous
forms
exhibiting
hardly
any
such
expansion
while
the
mesozoic
genera
present
a
greater
and
greater
development
until
in
the
tertiary
forms
the
expanded
ends
become
suturally
united
so
as
to
form
a
sort
of
false
vertebra
hermann
von
meyer
again
to
whose
luminous
researches
we
are
indebted
for
our
present
large
knowledge
of
the
organization
of
the
older
labyrinthodonts
has
proved
that
the
carboniferous
had
very
imperfectly
developed
vertebral
centra
while
the
triassic
had
the
same
parts
completely
ossified
the
regularity
and
evenness
of
the
dentition
of
the
as
contrasted
with
that
of
existing
artiodactyles
and
the
assumed
nearer
approach
of
the
dentition
of
certain
ancient
carnivores
to
the
typical
arrangement
have
also
been
cited
as
exemplifications
of
a
law
of
progressive
development
but
i
know
of
no
other
cases
based
on
positive
evidence
which
are
worthy
of
particular
notice
what
then
does
an
impartial
survey
of
the
positively
ascertained
truths
of
pal√¶ontology
testify
in
relation
to
the
common
doctrines
of
progressive
modification
which
suppose
that
modification
to
have
taken
place
by
a
necessary
progress
from
more
to
less
embryonic
forms
or
from
more
to
less
generalized
types
within
the
limits
of
the
period
represented
by
the
fossiliferous
rocks
it
negatives
those
doctrines
for
it
either
shows
us
no
evidence
of
any
such
modification
or
demonstrates
it
to
have
been
very
slight
and
as
to
the
nature
of
that
modification
it
yields
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
earlier
members
of
any
group
were
more
generalized
in
structure
than
the
later
ones
to
a
certain
extent
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
imperfect
ossification
of
the
vertebral
column
is
an
embryonic
character
but
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
extremely
incorrect
to
suppose
that
the
vertebral
columns
of
the
older
vertebrata
are
in
any
sense
embryonic
in
their
whole
structure
obviously
if
the
earliest
fossiliferous
rocks
now
known
are
coeval
with
the
commencement
of
life
and
if
their
contents
give
us
any
just
conception
of
the
nature
and
the
extent
of
the
earliest
fauna
and
flora
the
insignificant
amount
of
modification
which
can
be
demonstrated
to
have
taken
place
in
any
one
group
of
animals
or
plants
is
quite
incompatible
with
the
hypothesis
that
all
living
forms
are
the
results
of
a
necessary
process
of
progressive
development
entirely
comprised
within
the
time
represented
by
the
fossiliferous
rocks
contrariwise
any
admissible
hypothesis
of
progressive
modification
must
be
compatible
with
persistence
without
progression
through
indefinite
periods
and
should
such
an
hypothesis
eventually
be
proved
to
be
true
in
the
only
way
in
which
it
can
be
demonstrated
viz
by
observation
and
experiment
upon
the
existing
forms
of
life
the
conclusion
will
inevitably
present
itself
that
the
pal√¶ozoic
mesozoic
and
cainozoic
faun√¶
and
flor√¶
taken
together
bear
somewhat
the
same
proportion
to
the
whole
series
of
living
beings
which
have
occupied
this
globe
as
the
existing
fauna
and
flora
do
to
them
such
are
the
results
of
pal√¶ontology
as
they
appear
and
have
for
some
years
appeared
to
the
mind
of
an
inquirer
who
regards
that
study
simply
as
one
of
the
applications
of
the
great
biological
sciences
and
who
desires
to
see
it
placed
upon
the
same
sound
basis
as
other
branches
of
physical
inquiry
if
the
arguments
which
have
been
brought
forward
are
valid
probably
no
one
in
view
of
the
present
state
of
opinion
will
be

geological
reform
a
great
reform
in
geological
speculation
seems
now
to
have
become
necessary
it
is
quite
certain
that
a
great
mistake
has
been
made
that
british
popular
geology
at
the
present
time
is
in
direct
opposition
to
the
principles
of
natural
philosophy
in
reviewing
the
course
of
geological
thought
during
the
past
year
for
the
purpose
of
discovering
those
matters
to
which
i
might
most
fitly
direct
your
attention
in
the
address
which
it
now
becomes
my
duty
to
deliver
from
the
presidential
chair
the
two
somewhat
alarming
sentences
which
i
have
just
read
and
which
occur
in
an
able
and
interesting
essay
by
an
eminent
natural
philosopher
rose
into
such
prominence
before
my
mind
that
they
eclipsed
everything
else
it
surely
is
a
matter
of
paramount
importance
for
the
british
geologists
some
of
them
very
popular
geologists
too
here
in
solemn
annual
session
assembled
to
inquire
whether
the
severe
judgment
thus
passed
upon
them
by
so
high
an
authority
as
sir
william
thomson
is
one
to
which
they
must
plead
guilty
or
whether
they
are
prepared
to
say
not
guilty
and
appeal
for
a
reversal
of
the
sentence
to
that
higher
court
of
educated
scientific
opinion
to
which
we
are
all
amenable
as
your
for
the
time
being
i
thought
i
could
not
do
better
than
get
up
the
case
with
a
view
of
advising
you
it
is
true
that
the
charges
brought
forward
by
the
other
side
involve
the
consideration
of
matters
quite
foreign
to
the
pursuits
with
which
i
am
ordinarily
occupied
but
in
that
respect
i
am
only
in
the
position
which
is
nine
times
out
of
ten
occupied
by
counsel
who
nevertheless
contrive
to
gain
their
causes
mainly
by
force
of
and
common
sense
aided
by
some
training
in
other
intellectual
exercises
nerved
by
such
precedents
i
proceed
to
put
my
pleading
before
you
and
the
first
question
with
which
i
propose
to
deal
is
what
is
it
to
which
sir
thomson
refers
when
he
speaks
of
geological
speculation
and
british
popular
geology
i
find
three
more
or
less
contradictory
systems
of
geological
thought
each
of
which
might
fairly
enough
claim
these
appellations
standing
side
by
side
in
britain
i
shall
call
one
of
them
catastrophism
another
uniformitarianism
the
third
evolutionism
and
i
shall
try
briefly
to
sketch
the
characters
of
each
that
you
may
say
whether
the
classification
is
or
is
not
exhaustive
by
catastrophism
i
mean
any
form
of
geological
speculation
which
in
order
to
account
for
the
ph√¶nomena
of
geology
supposes
the
operation
of
forces
different
in
their
nature
or
immeasurably
different
in
power
from
those
which
we
at
present
see
in
action
in
the
universe
the
mosaic
cosmogony
is
in
this
sense
catastrophic
because
it
assumes
the
operation
of
power
the
doctrine
of
violent
upheavals
and
cataclysms
in
general
is
catastrophic
so
far
as
it
assumes
that
these
were
brought
about
by
causes
which
have
now
no
parallel
there
was
a
time
when
catastrophism
might
have
claimed
the
title
of
british
popular
geology
and
assuredly
it
has
yet
many
adherents
and
reckons
among
its
supporters
some
of
the
most
honoured
members
of
this
society
by
uniformitarianism
i
mean
especially
the
teaching
of
hutton
and
of
lyell
that
great
though
incomplete
work
the
theory
of
the
earth
seems
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
most
remarkable
contributions
to
geology
which
is
recorded
in
the
annals
of
the
science
so
far
as
the
world
is
concerned
uniformitarianism
lies
there
not
only
in
germ
but
in
blossom
and
fruit
if
one
asks
how
it
is
that
hutton
was
led
to
entertain
views
so
far
in
advance
of
those
prevalent
in
his
time
in
some
respects
while
in
others
they
seem
almost
curiously
limited
the
answer
appears
to
me
to
be
plain
hutton
was
in
advance
of
the
geological
speculation
of
his
time
because
in
the
first
place
he
had
amassed
a
vast
store
of
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
geology
gathered
by
personal
observation
in
travels
of
considerable
extent
and
because
in
the
second
place
he
was
thoroughly
trained
in
the
physical
and
chemical
science
of
his
day
and
thus
possessed
as
much
as
any
one
in
his
time
could
possess
it
the
knowledge
which
is
requisite
for
the
just
interpretation
of
geological
ph√¶nomena
and
the
habit
of
thought
which
fits
a
man
for
scientific
inquiry
it
is
to
this
thorough
scientific
training
that
i
ascribe
steady
and
persistent
refusal
to
look
to
other
causes
than
those
now
in
operation
for
the
explanation
of
geological
ph√¶nomena
thus
he
writes
i
do
not
pretend
as
he
de
luc
does
in
his
theory
to
describe
the
beginning
of
things
i
take
things
such
as
i
find
them
at
present
and
from
these
i
reason
with
regard
to
that
which
must
have
been
and
again
a
theory
of
the
earth
which
has
for
object
truth
can
have
no
retrospect
to
that
which
had
preceded
the
present
order
of
the
world
for
this
order
alone
is
what
we
have
to
reason
upon
and
to
reason
without
data
is
nothing
but
delusion
a
theory
therefore
which
is
limited
to
the
actual
constitution
of
this
earth
can
not
be
allowed
to
proceed
one
step
beyond
the
present
order
of
things
and
so
clear
is
he
that
no
causes
beside
such
as
are
now
in
operation
are
needed
to
account
for
the
character
and
disposition
of
the
components
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
that
he
says
broadly
and
boldly
there
is
no
part
of
the
earth
which
has
not
had
the
same
origin
so
far
as
this
consists
in
that
earth
being
collected
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
afterwards
produced
as
land
along
with
masses
of
melted
substances
by
the
operation
of
mineral
causes
but
other
influences
were
at
work
upon
hutton
beside
those
of
a
mind
logical
by
nature
and
scientific
by
sound
training
and
the
peculiar
turn
which
his
speculations
took
seems
to
me
to
be
unintelligible
unless
these
be
taken
into
account
the
arguments
of
the
french
astronomers
and
mathematicians
which
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
were
held
to
demonstrate
the
existence
of
a
compensating
arrangement
among
the
celestial
bodies
whereby
all
perturbations
eventually
reduced
themselves
to
oscillations
on
each
side
of
a
mean
position
and
the
stability
of
the
solar
system
was
secured
had
evidently
taken
strong
hold
of
hutton
mind
in
those
oddly
constructed
periods
which
seem
to
have
prejudiced
many
persons
against
reading
his
works
but
which
are
full
of
that
peculiar
if
unattractive
eloquence
which
flows
from
mastery
of
the
subject
hutton
says
we
have
now
got
to
the
end
of
our
reasoning
we
have
no
data
further
to
conclude
immediately
from
that
which
actually
is
but
we
have
got
enough
we
have
the
satisfaction
to
find
that
in
nature
there
is
wisdom
system
and
consistency
for
having
in
the
natural
history
of
this
earth
seen
a
succession
of
worlds
we
may
from
this
conclude
that
there
is
a
system
in
nature
in
like
manner
as
from
seeing
revolutions
of
the
planets
it
is
concluded
that
there
is
a
system
by
which
they
are
intended
to
continue
those
revolutions
but
if
the
succession
of
worlds
is
established
in
the
system
of
nature
it
is
in
vain
to
look
for
anything
higher
in
the
origin
of
the
earth
the
result
therefore
of
this
physical
inquiry
is
that
we
find
no
vestige
of
a
beginning
no
prospect
of
an
end
yet
another
influence
worked
strongly
upon
hutton
like
most
philosophers
of
his
age
he
coquetted
with
those
final
causes
which
have
been
named
barren
virgins
but
which
might
be
more
fitly
termed
the
of
philosophy
so
constantly
have
they
led
men
astray
the
final
cause
of
the
existence
of
the
world
is
for
hutton
the
production
of
life
and
intelligence
we
have
now
considered
the
globe
of
this
earth
as
a
machine
constructed
upon
chemical
as
well
as
mechanical
principles
by
which
its
different
parts
are
all
adapted
in
form
in
quality
and
in
quantity
to
a
certain
end
an
end
attained
with
certainty
or
success
and
an
end
from
which
we
may
perceive
wisdom
in
contemplating
the
means
employed
but
is
this
world
to
be
considered
thus
merely
as
a
machine
to
last
no
longer
than
its
parts
retain
their
present
position
their
proper
forms
and
qualities
or
may
it
not
be
also
considered
as
an
organized
body
such
as
has
a
constitution
in
which
the
necessary
decay
of
the
machine
is
naturally
repaired
in
the
exertion
of
those
productive
powers
by
which
it
had
been
formed
this
is
the
view
in
which
we
are
now
to
examine
the
globe
to
see
if
there
be
in
the
constitution
of
this
world
a
reproductive
operation
by
which
a
ruined
constitution
may
be
again
repaired
and
a
duration
or
stability
thus
procured
to
the
machine
considered
as
a
world
sustaining
plants
and
animals
kirwan
and
the
other
philistines
of
the
day
accused
hutton
of
declaring
that
his
theory
implied
that
the
world
never
had
a
beginning
and
never
differed
in
condition
from
its
present
state
nothing
could
be
more
grossly
unjust
as
he
expressly
guards
himself
against
any
such
conclusion
in
the
following
terms
but
in
thus
tracing
back
the
natural
operations
which
have
succeeded
each
other
and
mark
to
us
the
course
of
time
past
we
come
to
a
period
in
which
we
can
not
see
any
farther
this
however
is
not
the
beginning
of
the
operations
which
proceed
in
time
and
according
to
the
wise
economy
of
this
world
nor
is
it
the
establishing
of
that
which
in
the
course
of
time
had
no
beginning
it
is
only
the
limit
of
our
retrospective
view
of
those
operations
which
have
come
to
pass
in
time
and
have
been
conducted
by
supreme
intelligence
i
have
spoken
of
uniformitarianism
as
the
doctrine
of
hutton
and
of
lyell
if
i
have
quoted
the
older
writer
rather
than
the
newer
it
is
because
his
works
are
little
known
and
his
claims
on
our
veneration
too
frequently
forgotten
not
because
i
desire
to
dim
the
fame
of
his
eminent
successor
few
of
the
present
generation
of
geologists
have
read
playfair
illustrations
fewer
still
the
original
theory
of
the
earth
the
more
is
the
pity
but
which
of
us
has
not
thumbed
every
page
of
the
principles
of
geology
i
think
that
he
who
writes
fairly
the
history
of
his
own
progress
in
geological
thought
will
not
be
able
to
separate
his
debt
to
hutton
from
his
obligations
to
lyell
and
the
history
of
the
progress
of
individual
geologists
is
the
history
of
geology
no
one
can
doubt
that
the
influence
of
uniformitarian
views
has
been
enormous
and
in
the
main
most
beneficial
and
favourable
to
the
progress
of
sound
geology
nor
can
it
be
questioned
that
uniformitarianism
has
even
a
stronger
title
than
catastrophism
to
call
itself
the
geological
speculation
of
britain
or
if
you
will
british
popular
geology
for
it
is
eminently
a
british
doctrine
and
has
even
now
made
comparatively
little
progress
on
the
continent
of
europe
nevertheless
it
seems
to
me
to
be
open
to
serious
criticism
upon
one
of
its
aspects
i
have
shown
how
unjust
was
the
insinuation
that
hutton
denied
a
beginning
to
the
world
but
it
would
not
be
unjust
to
say
that
he
persistently
in
practice
shut
his
eyes
to
the
existence
of
that
prior
and
different
state
of
things
which
in
theory
he
admitted
and
in
this
aversion
to
look
beyond
the
veil
of
stratified
rocks
lyell
follows
him
hutton
and
lyell
alike
agree
in
their
indisposition
to
carry
their
speculations
a
step
beyond
the
period
recorded
in
the
most
ancient
strata
now
open
to
observation
in
the
crust
of
the
earth
this
is
for
hutton
the
point
in
which
we
can
not
see
any
farther
while
lyell
tells
us
the
astronomer
may
find
good
reasons
for
ascribing
the
earth
form
to
the
original
fluidity
of
the
mass
in
times
long
antecedent
to
the
first
introduction
of
living
beings
into
the
planet
but
the
geologist
must
be
content
to
regard
the
earliest
monuments
which
it
is
his
task
to
interpret
as
belonging
to
a
period
when
the
crust
had
already
acquired
great
solidity
and
thickness
probably
as
great
as
it
now
possesses
and
when
volcanic
rocks
not
essentially
differing
from
those
now
produced
were
formed
from
time
to
time
the
intensity
of
volcanic
heat
being
neither
greater
nor
less
than
it
is
now
and
again
as
geologists
we
learn
that
it
is
not
only
the
present
condition
of
the
globe
which
has
been
suited
to
the
accommodation
of
myriads
of
living
creatures
but
that
many
former
states
also
have
been
adapted
to
the
organization
and
habits
of
prior
races
of
beings
the
disposition
of
the
seas
continents
and
islands
and
the
climates
have
varied
the
species
likewise
have
been
changed
and
yet
they
have
all
been
so
modelled
on
types
analogous
to
those
of
existing
plants
and
animals
as
to
indicate
throughout
a
perfect
harmony
of
design
and
unity
of
purpose
to
assume
that
the
evidence
of
the
beginning
or
end
of
so
vast
a
scheme
lies
within
the
reach
of
our
philosophical
inquiries
or
even
of
our
speculations
appears
to
be
inconsistent
with
a
just
estimate
of
the
relations
which
subsist
between
the
finite
powers
of
man
and
the
attributes
of
an
infinite
and
eternal
being
the
limitations
implied
in
these
passages
appear
to
me
to
constitute
the
weakness
and
the
logical
defect
of
uniformitarianism
no
one
will
impute
blame
to
hutton
that
in
face
of
the
imperfect
condition
in
his
day
of
those
physical
sciences
which
furnish
the
keys
to
the
riddles
of
geology
he
should
have
thought
it
practical
wisdom
to
limit
his
theory
to
an
attempt
to
account
for
the
present
order
of
things
but
i
am
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
why
for
all
time
the
geologist
must
be
content
to
regard
the
oldest
fossiliferous
rocks
as
the
of
his
science
or
what
there
is
inconsistent
with
the
relations
between
the
finite
and
the
infinite
mind
in
the
assumption
that
we
may
discern
somewhat
of
the
beginning
or
of
the
end
of
this
speck
in
space
we
call
our
earth
the
finite
mind
is
certainly
competent
to
trace
out
the
development
of
the
fowl
within
the
egg
and
i
know
not
on
what
ground
it
should
find
more
difficulty
in
unravelling
the
complexities
of
the
development
of
the
earth
in
fact
as
kant
has
well
remarked
the
cosmical
process
is
really
simpler
than
the
biological
this
attempt
to
limit
at
a
particular
point
the
progress
of
inductive
and
deductive
reasoning
from
the
things
which
are
to
those
which
were
this
faithlessness
to
its
own
logic
seems
to
me
to
have
cost
uniformitarianism
the
place
as
the
permanent
form
of
geological
speculation
which
it
might
otherwise
have
held
it
remains
that
i
should
put
before
you
what
i
understand
to
be
the
third
phase
of
geological
speculation
namely
evolutionism
i
shall
not
make
what
i
have
to
say
on
this
head
clear
unless
i
diverge
or
seem
to
diverge
for
a
while
from
the
direct
path
of
my
discourse
so
far
as
to
explain
what
i
take
to
be
the
scope
of
geology
itself
i
conceive
geology
to
be
the
history
of
the
earth
in
precisely
the
same
sense
as
biology
is
the
history
of
living
beings
and
i
trust
you
will
not
think
that
i
am
overpowered
by
the
influence
of
a
dominant
pursuit
if
i
say
that
i
trace
a
close
analogy
between
these
two
histories
if
i
study
a
living
being
under
what
heads
does
the
knowledge
i
obtain
fall
i
can
learn
its
structure
or
what
we
call
its
anatomy
and
its
development
or
the
series
of
changes
which
it
passes
through
to
acquire
its
complete
structure
then
i
find
that
the
living
being
has
certain
powers
resulting
from
its
own
activities
and
the
interaction
of
these
with
the
activities
of
other
things
the
knowledge
of
which
is
physiology
beyond
this
the
living
being
has
a
position
in
space
and
time
which
is
its
distribution
all
these
form
the
body
of
ascertainable
facts
which
constitute
the
of
the
living
creature
but
these
facts
have
their
causes
and
the
ascertainment
of
these
causes
is
the
doctrine
of
√¶tiology
if
we
consider
what
is
knowable
about
the
earth
we
shall
find
that
such
if
i
may
so
translate
the
word
geology
falls
into
the
same
categories
what
is
termed
stratigraphical
geology
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
anatomy
of
the
earth
and
the
history
of
the
succession
of
the
formations
is
the
history
of
a
succession
of
such
anatomies
or
corresponds
with
development
as
distinct
from
generation
the
internal
heat
of
the
earth
the
elevation
and
depression
of
its
crust
its
belchings
forth
of
vapours
ashes
and
lava
are
its
activities
in
as
strict
a
sense
as
are
warmth
and
the
movements
and
products
of
respiration
the
activities
of
an
animal
the
ph√¶nomena
of
the
seasons
of
the
trade
winds
of
the
are
as
much
the
results
of
the
reaction
between
these
inner
activities
and
outward
forces
as
are
the
budding
of
the
leaves
in
spring
and
their
falling
in
autumn
the
effects
of
the
interaction
between
the
organization
of
a
plant
and
the
solar
light
and
heat
and
as
the
study
of
the
activities
of
the
living
being
is
called
its
physiology
so
are
these
ph√¶nomena
the
of
an
analogous
telluric
physiology
to
which
we
sometimes
give
the
name
of
meteorology
sometimes
that
of
physical
geography
sometimes
that
of
geology
again
the
earth
has
a
place
in
space
and
in
time
and
relations
to
other
bodies
in
both
these
respects
which
constitute
its
distribution
this
subject
is
usually
left
to
the
astronomer
but
a
knowledge
of
its
broad
outlines
seems
to
me
to
be
an
essential
constituent
of
the
stock
of
geological
ideas
all
that
can
be
ascertained
concerning
the
structure
succession
of
conditions
actions
and
position
in
space
of
the
earth
is
the
matter
of
fact
of
its
natural
history
but
as
in
biology
there
remains
the
matter
of
reasoning
from
these
facts
to
their
causes
which
is
just
as
much
science
as
the
other
and
indeed
more
and
this
constitutes
geological
√¶tiology
having
regard
to
this
general
scheme
of
geological
knowledge
and
thought
it
is
obvious
that
geological
speculation
may
be
so
to
speak
anatomical
and
developmental
speculation
so
far
as
it
relates
to
points
of
stratigraphical
arrangement
which
are
out
of
reach
of
direct
observation
or
it
may
be
physiological
speculation
so
far
as
it
relates
to
undetermined
problems
relative
to
the
activities
of
the
earth
or
it
may
be
distributional
speculation
if
it
deals
with
modifications
of
the
earth
place
in
space
or
finally
it
will
be
√¶tiological
speculation
if
it
attempts
to
deduce
the
history
of
the
world
as
a
whole
from
the
known
properties
of
the
matter
of
the
earth
in
the
conditions
in
which
the
earth
has
been
placed
for
the
purposes
of
the
present
discourse
i
may
take
this
last
to
be
what
is
meant
by
geological
speculation
now
uniformitarianism
as
we
have
seen
tends
to
ignore
geological
speculation
in
this
sense
altogether
the
one
point
the
catastrophists
and
the
uniformitarians
agreed
upon
when
this
society
was
founded
was
to
ignore
it
and
you
will
find
if
you
look
back
into
our
records
that
our
revered
fathers
in
geology
plumed
themselves
a
good
deal
upon
the
practical
sense
and
wisdom
of
this
proceeding
as
a
temporary
measure
i
do
not
presume
to
challenge
its
wisdom
but
in
all
organized
bodies
temporary
changes
are
apt
to
produce
permanent
effects
and
as
time
has
slipped
by
altering
all
the
conditions
which
may
have
made
such
mortification
of
the
scientific
flesh
desirable
i
think
the
effect
of
the
stream
of
cold
water
which
has
steadily
flowed
over
geological
speculation
within
these
walls
has
been
of
doubtful
beneficence
the
sort
of
geological
speculation
to
which
i
am
now
referring
geological
√¶tiology
in
short
was
created
as
a
science
by
that
famous
philosopher
immanuel
kant
when
in
he
wrote
his
general
natural
history
and
theory
of
the
celestial
bodies
or
an
attempt
to
account
for
the
constitution
and
the
mechanical
origin
of
the
universe
upon
newtonian
principles
in
this
very
remarkable
but
seemingly
treatise
kant
expounds
a
complete
cosmogony
in
the
shape
of
a
theory
of
the
causes
which
have
led
to
the
development
of
the
universe
from
diffused
atoms
of
matter
endowed
with
simple
attractive
and
repulsive
forces
give
me
matter
says
kant
and
i
will
build
the
world
and
he
proceeds
to
deduce
from
the
simple
data
from
which
he
starts
a
doctrine
in
all
essential
respects
similar
to
the
nebular
hypothesis
of
laplace
he
accounts
for
the
relation
of
the
masses
and
the
densities
of
the
planets
to
their
distances
from
the
sun
for
the
eccentricities
of
their
orbits
for
their
rotations
for
their
satellites
for
the
general
agreement
in
the
direction
of
rotation
among
the
celestial
bodies
for
saturn
ring
and
for
the
zodiacal
light
he
finds
in
each
system
of
worlds
indications
that
the
attractive
force
of
the
central
mass
will
eventually
destroy
its
organization
by
concentrating
upon
itself
the
matter
of
the
whole
system
but
as
the
result
of
this
concentration
he
argues
for
the
development
of
an
amount
of
heat
which
will
dissipate
the
mass
once
more
into
a
molecular
chaos
such
as
that
in
which
it
began
kant
pictures
to
himself
the
universe
as
once
an
infinite
expansion
of
formless
and
diffused
matter
at
one
point
of
this
he
supposes
a
single
centre
of
attraction
set
up
and
by
strict
deductions
from
admitted
dynamical
principles
shows
how
this
must
result
in
the
development
of
a
prodigious
central
body
surrounded
by
systems
of
solar
and
planetary
worlds
in
all
stages
of
development
in
vivid
language
he
depicts
the
great
widening
the
margins
of
its
prodigious
eddy
in
the
slow
progress
of
millions
of
ages
gradually
reclaiming
more
and
more
of
the
molecular
waste
and
converting
chaos
into
cosmos
but
what
is
gained
at
the
margin
is
lost
in
the
centre
the
attractions
of
the
central
systems
bring
their
constituents
together
which
then
by
the
heat
evolved
are
converted
once
more
into
molecular
chaos
thus
the
worlds
that
are
lie
between
the
ruins
of
the
worlds
that
have
been
and
the
chaotic
materials
of
the
worlds
that
shall
be
and
in
spite
of
all
waste
and
destruction
cosmos
is
extending
his
borders
at
the
expense
of
chaos
kant
further
application
of
his
views
to
the
earth
itself
is
to
be
found
in
his
treatise
on
physical
geography
a
term
under
which
the
then
unknown
science
of
geology
was
included
a
subject
which
he
had
studied
with
very
great
care
and
on
which
he
lectured
for
many
years
the
fourth
section
of
the
first
part
of
this
treatise
is
called
history
of
the
great
changes
which
the
earth
has
formerly
undergone
and
is
still
undergoing
and
is
in
fact
a
brief
and
pregnant
essay
upon
the
principles
of
geology
kant
gives
an
account
first
of
the
gradual
changes
which
are
now
taking
place
under
the
heads
of
such
as
are
caused
by
earthquakes
such
as
are
brought
about
by
rain
and
rivers
such
as
are
effected
by
the
sea
such
as
are
produced
by
winds
and
frost
and
finally
such
as
result
from
the
operations
of
man
the
second
part
is
devoted
to
the
memorials
of
the
changes
which
the
earth
has
undergone
in
remote
antiquity
these
are
enumerated
as
a
proofs
that
the
sea
formerly
covered
the
whole
earth
b
proofs
that
the
sea
has
often
been
changed
into
dry
land
and
then
again
into
sea
a
discussion
of
the
of
the
earth
put
forward
by
scheuchzer
moro
bonnet
woodward
white
leibnitz
linn√¶us
and
buffon
the
third
part
contains
an
attempt
to
give
a
sound
explanation
of
the
ancient
history
of
the
earth
i
suppose
that
it
would
be
very
easy
to
pick
holes
in
the
details
of
kant
speculations
whether
cosmological
or
specially
telluric
in
their
application
but
for
all
that
he
seems
to
me
to
have
been
the
first
person
to
frame
a
complete
system
of
geological
speculation
by
founding
the
doctrine
of
evolution
with
as
much
truth
as
hutton
kant
could
say
i
take
things
just
as
i
find
them
at
present
and
from
these
i
reason
with
regard
to
that
which
must
have
been
like
hutton
he
is
never
tired
of
pointing
out
that
in
nature
there
is
wisdom
system
and
consistency
and
as
in
these
great
principles
so
in
believing
that
the
cosmos
has
a
reproductive
operation
by
which
a
ruined
constitution
may
be
repaired
he
forestalls
hutton
while
on
the
other
hand
kant
is
true
to
science
he
knows
no
bounds
to
geological
speculation
but
those
of
the
intellect
he
reasons
back
to
a
beginning
of
the
present
state
of
things
he
admits
the
possibility
of
an
end
i
have
said
that
the
three
schools
of
geological
speculation
which
i
have
termed
catastrophism
uniformitarianism
and
evolutionism
are
commonly
supposed
to
be
antagonistic
to
one
another
and
i
presume
it
will
have
become
obvious
that
in
my
belief
the
last
is
destined
to
swallow
up
the
other
two
but
it
is
proper
to
remark
that
each
of
the
latter
has
kept
alive
the
tradition
of
precious
truths
catastrophism
has
insisted
upon
the
existence
of
a
practically
unlimited
bank
of
force
on
which
the
theorist
might
draw
and
it
has
cherished
the
idea
of
the
development
of
the
earth
from
a
state
in
which
its
form
and
the
forces
which
it
exerted
were
very
different
from
those
we
now
know
that
such
difference
of
form
and
power
once
existed
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
doctrine
of
evolution
uniformitarianism
on
the
other
hand
has
with
equal
justice
insisted
upon
a
practically
unlimited
bank
of
time
ready
to
discount
any
quantity
of
hypothetical
paper
it
has
kept
before
our
eyes
the
power
of
the
infinitely
little
time
being
granted
and
has
compelled
us
to
exhaust
known
causes
before
flying
to
the
unknown
to
my
mind
there
appears
to
be
no
sort
of
necessary
theoretical
antagonism
between
catastrophism
and
uniformitarianism
on
the
contrary
it
is
very
conceivable
that
catastrophes
may
be
part
and
parcel
of
uniformity
let
me
illustrate
my
case
by
analogy
the
working
of
a
clock
is
a
model
of
uniform
action
good
means
uniformity
of
action
but
the
striking
of
the
clock
is
essentially
a
catastrophe
the
hammer
might
be
made
to
blow
up
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
or
turn
on
a
deluge
of
water
and
by
proper
arrangement
the
clock
instead
of
marking
the
hours
might
strike
at
all
sorts
of
irregular
periods
never
twice
alike
in
the
intervals
force
or
number
of
its
blows
nevertheless
all
these
irregular
and
apparently
lawless
catastrophes
would
be
the
result
of
an
absolutely
uniformitarian
action
and
we
might
have
two
schools
of
one
studying
the
hammer
and
the
other
the
pendulum
still
less
is
there
any
necessary
antagonism
between
either
of
these
doctrines
and
that
of
evolution
which
embraces
all
that
is
sound
in
both
catastrophism
and
uniformitarianism
while
it
rejects
the
arbitrary
assumptions
of
the
one
and
the
as
arbitrary
limitations
of
the
other
nor
is
the
value
of
the
doctrine
of
evolution
to
the
philosophic
thinker
diminished
by
the
fact
that
it
applies
the
same
method
to
the
living
and
the
world
and
embraces
in
one
stupendous
analogy
the
growth
of
a
solar
system
from
molecular
chaos
the
shaping
of
the
earth
from
the
nebulous
cubhood
of
its
youth
through
innumerable
changes
and
immeasurable
ages
to
its
present
form
and
the
development
of
a
living
being
from
the
shapeless
mass
of
protoplasm
we
term
a
germ
i
do
not
know
whether
evolutionism
can
claim
that
amount
of
currency
which
would
entitle
it
to
be
called
british
popular
geology
but
more
or
less
vaguely
it
is
assuredly
present
in
the
minds
of
most
geologists
such
being
the
three
phases
of
geological
speculation
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
inquire
which
of
these
it
is
that
sir
william
thomson
calls
upon
us
to
reform
in
the
passages
which
i
have
cited
it
is
obviously
uniformitarianism
which
the
distinguished
physicist
takes
to
be
the
representative
of
geological
speculation
in
general
and
thus
a
first
issue
is
raised
inasmuch
as
many
persons
and
those
not
the
least
thoughtful
among
the
younger
geologists
do
not
accept
strict
uniformitarianism
as
the
final
form
of
geological
speculation
we
should
say
if
hutton
and
playfair
declare
the
course
of
the
world
to
have
been
always
the
same
point
out
the
fallacy
by
all
means
but
in
so
doing
do
not
imagine
that
you
are
proving
modern
geology
to
be
in
opposition
to
natural
philosophy
i
do
not
suppose
that
at
the
present
day
any
geologist
would
be
found
to
maintain
absolute
uniformitarianism
to
deny
that
the
rapidity
of
the
rotation
of
the
earth
be
diminishing
that
the
sun
be
waxing
dim
or
that
the
earth
itself
be
cooling
most
of
us
i
suspect
are
gallios
who
care
for
none
of
these
things
being
of
opinion
that
true
or
fictitious
they
have
made
no
practical
difference
to
the
earth
during
the
period
of
which
a
record
is
preserved
in
stratified
deposits
the
accusation
that
we
have
been
running
counter
to
the
of
natural
philosophy
therefore
is
devoid
of
foundation
the
only
question
which
can
arise
is
whether
we
have
or
have
not
been
tacitly
making
assumptions
which
are
in
opposition
to
certain
conclusions
which
may
be
drawn
from
those
principles
and
this
question
subdivides
itself
into
two
the
first
are
we
really
contravening
such
conclusions
the
second
if
we
are
are
those
conclusions
so
firmly
based
that
we
may
not
contravene
them
i
reply
in
the
negative
to
both
these
questions
and
i
will
give
you
my
reasons
for
so
doing
sir
william
thomson
believes
that
he
is
able
to
prove
by
physical
reasonings
that
the
existing
state
of
things
on
the
earth
life
on
the
earth
all
geological
history
showing
continuity
of
life
must
be
limited
within
some
such
period
of
time
as
one
hundred
million
years
loc
cit
the
first
inquiry
which
arises
plainly
is
has
it
ever
been
denied
that
this
period
be
enough
for
the
purposes
of
geology
the
discussion
of
this
question
is
greatly
embarrassed
by
the
vagueness
with
which
the
assumed
limit
is
i
will
not
say
defined
but
indicated
some
such
period
of
past
time
as
one
hundred
million
years
now
does
this
mean
that
it
may
have
been
two
or
three
or
four
hundred
million
years
because
this
really
makes
all
the
difference
i
presume
that
feet
may
be
taken
as
a
full
allowance
for
the
total
thickness
of
stratified
rocks
containing
traces
of
life
divided
by
consequently
the
deposit
of
feet
of
stratified
rock
in
years
means
that
the
deposit
has
taken
place
at
the
rate
of
of
a
foot
or
say
of
an
inch
per
annum
well
i
do
not
know
that
any
one
is
prepared
to
maintain
that
even
making
all
needful
allowances
the
stratified
rocks
may
not
have
been
formed
on
the
average
at
the
rate
of
of
an
inch
per
annum
i
suppose
that
if
such
could
be
shown
to
be
the
limit
of
we
could
put
up
with
the
allowance
without
feeling
that
our
speculations
had
undergone
any
revolution
and
perhaps
after
all
the
qualifying
phrase
some
such
period
may
not
necessitate
the
assumption
of
more
than
or
or
of
an
inch
of
deposit
per
year
which
of
course
would
give
us
still
more
ease
and
comfort
but
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
biology
and
not
geology
which
asks
for
so
much
time
that
the
succession
of
life
demands
vast
intervals
but
this
appears
to
me
to
be
reasoning
in
a
circle
biology
takes
her
time
from
geology
the
only
reason
we
have
for
believing
in
the
slow
rate
of
the
change
in
living
forms
is
the
fact
that
they
persist
through
a
series
of
deposits
which
geology
informs
us
have
taken
a
long
while
to
make
if
the
geological
clock
is
wrong
all
the
naturalist
will
have
to
do
is
to
modify
his
notions
of
the
rapidity
of
change
accordingly
and
i
venture
to
point
out
that
when
we
are
told
that
the
limitation
of
the
period
during
which
living
beings
have
inhabited
this
planet
to
one
two
or
three
hundred
million
years
requires
a
complete
revolution
in
geological
speculation
the
rests
on
the
maker
of
the
assertion
who
brings
forward
not
a
shadow
of
evidence
in
its
support
thus
if
we
accept
the
limitation
of
time
placed
before
us
by
sir
thomson
it
is
not
obvious
on
the
face
of
the
matter
that
we
shall
have
to
alter
or
reform
our
ways
in
any
appreciable
degree
and
we
may
therefore
proceed
with
much
calmness
and
indeed
much
indifference
as
to
the
result
to
inquire
whether
that
limitation
is
justified
by
the
arguments
employed
in
its
support
these
arguments
are
three
in
number
i
the
first
is
based
upon
the
undoubted
fact
that
the
tides
tend
to
retard
the
rate
of
the
earth
rotation
upon
its
axis
that
this
must
be
so
is
obvious
if
one
considers
roughly
that
the
tides
result
from
the
pull
which
the
sun
and
the
moon
exert
upon
the
sea
causing
it
to
act
as
a
sort
of
break
upon
the
rotating
solid
earth
kant
who
was
by
no
means
a
mere
abstract
philosopher
but
a
good
mathematician
and
well
versed
in
the
physical
science
of
his
time
not
only
proved
this
in
an
essay
of
exquisite
clearness
and
intelligibility
now
more
than
a
century
old
but
deduced
from
it
some
of
its
more
important
consequences
such
as
the
constant
turning
of
one
face
of
the
moon
towards
the
earth
but
there
is
a
long
step
from
the
demonstration
of
a
tendency
to
the
estimation
of
the
practical
value
of
that
tendency
which
is
all
with
which
we
are
at
present
concerned
the
facts
bearing
on
this
point
appear
to
stand
as
follow
it
is
a
matter
of
observation
that
the
moon
mean
motion
is
and
has
for
the
last
years
been
undergoing
an
acceleration
relatively
to
the
rotation
of
the
earth
of
course
this
may
result
from
one
of
two
causes
the
moon
may
really
have
been
moving
more
swiftly
in
its
orbit
or
the
earth
may
have
been
rotating
more
slowly
on
its
axis
laplace
believed
he
had
accounted
for
this
ph√¶nomenon
by
the
fact
that
the
eccentricity
of
the
earth
orbit
has
been
diminishing
throughout
these
years
this
would
produce
a
diminution
of
the
mean
attraction
of
the
sun
on
the
moon
or
in
other
words
an
increase
in
the
attraction
of
the
earth
on
the
moon
and
consequently
an
increase
in
the
rapidity
of
the
orbital
motion
of
the
latter
body
laplace
therefore
laid
the
responsibility
of
the
acceleration
upon
the
moon
and
if
his
views
were
correct
the
tidal
retardation
must
either
be
insignificant
in
amount
or
be
counteracted
by
some
other
agency
our
great
astronomer
adams
however
appears
to
have
found
a
flaw
in
laplace
calculation
and
to
have
shown
that
only
half
the
observed
retardation
could
be
accounted
for
in
the
way
he
had
suggested
there
remains
therefore
the
other
half
to
be
accounted
for
and
here
in
the
absence
of
all
positive
knowledge
three
sets
of
hypotheses
have
been
suggested
a
delaunay
suggests
that
the
earth
is
at
fault
in
consequence
of
the
tidal
retardation
adams
thomson
and
tait
work
out
this
suggestion
and
on
a
certain
assumption
as
to
the
proportion
of
retardations
due
to
the
sun
and
the
moon
find
the
earth
may
lose
seconds
of
time
in
a
century
from
this
cause
b
but
dufour
suggests
that
the
retardation
of
the
earth
which
is
hypothetically
assumed
to
exist
may
be
due
in
part
or
wholly
to
the
increase
of
the
moment
of
inertia
of
the
earth
by
meteors
falling
upon
its
surface
this
suggestion
also
meets
with
the
entire
approval
of
sir
thomson
who
shows
that
accumulating
at
the
rate
of
one
foot
in
years
would
account
for
the
remainder
of
retardation
c
thirdly
sir
thomson
brings
forward
an
hypothesis
of
his
own
with
respect
to
the
cause
of
the
hypothetical
retardation
of
the
rotation
let
us
suppose
ice
to
melt
from
the
polar
regions
round
each
pole
we
may
say
to
the
extent
of
something
more
than
a
foot
thick
enough
to
give
foot
of
water
over
those
areas
or
of
a
foot
of
water
if
spread
over
the
whole
globe
which
would
in
reality
raise
the
by
only
some
such
undiscoverable
difference
as
of
an
inch
or
an
inch
this
or
the
reverse
which
we
believe
might
happen
any
year
and
could
certainly
not
be
detected
without
far
more
accurate
observations
and
calculations
for
the
mean
than
any
hitherto
made
would
slacken
or
quicken
the
earth
rate
as
a
timekeeper
by
of
a
second
per
year
i
do
not
presume
to
throw
the
slightest
doubt
upon
the
accuracy
of
any
of
the
calculations
made
by
such
distinguished
mathematicians
as
those
who
have
made
the
suggestions
i
have
cited
on
the
contrary
it
is
necessary
to
my
argument
to
assume
that
they
are
all
correct
but
i
desire
to
point
out
that
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
many
cases
in
which
the
admitted
accuracy
of
mathematical
processes
is
allowed
to
throw
a
wholly
inadmissible
appearance
of
authority
over
the
results
obtained
by
them
mathematics
may
be
compared
to
a
mill
of
exquisite
workmanship
which
grinds
you
stuff
of
any
degree
of
fineness
but
nevertheless
what
you
get
out
depends
on
what
you
put
in
and
as
the
grandest
mill
in
the
world
will
not
extract
from
peascods
so
pages
of
formul√¶
will
not
get
a
definite
result
out
of
loose
data
in
the
present
instance
it
appears
to
be
admitted
that
it
is
not
absolutely
certain
after
all
whether
the
moon
mean
motion
is
undergoing
acceleration
or
the
earth
rotation
retardation
and
yet
this
is
the
key
of
the
whole
position
if
the
rapidity
of
the
earth
rotation
is
diminishing
it
is
not
certain
how
much
of
that
retardation
is
due
to
tidal
friction
how
much
to
meteors
how
much
to
possible
excess
of
melting
over
accumulation
of
polar
ice
during
the
period
covered
by
observation
which
amounts
at
the
outside
to
not
more
than
years
the
effect
of
a
different
distribution
of
land
and
water
in
modifying
the
retardation
caused
by
tidal
friction
and
of
reducing
it
under
some
circumstances
to
a
minimum
does
not
appear
to
be
taken
into
account
during
the
miocene
epoch
the
polar
ice
was
certainly
many
feet
thinner
than
it
has
been
during
or
since
the
glacial
epoch
sir
thomson
tells
us
that
the
accumulation
of
something
more
than
a
foot
of
ice
around
the
poles
which
implies
the
withdrawal
of
say
an
inch
of
water
from
the
general
surface
of
the
sea
will
cause
the
earth
to
rotate
quicker
by
of
a
second
per
annum
it
would
appear
therefore
that
the
earth
may
have
been
rotating
throughout
the
whole
period
which
has
elapsed
from
the
commencement
of
the
glacial
epoch
down
to
the
present
time
one
or
more
seconds
per
annum
quicker
than
it
rotated
during
the
miocene
epoch
but
according
to
sir
thomson
calculation
tidal
retardation
will
only
account
for
a
retardation
of
in
a
century
or
say
of
a
second
per
annum
thus
assuming
that
the
accumulation
of
polar
ice
since
the
miocene
epoch
has
only
been
sufficient
to
produce
ten
times
the
effect
of
a
coat
of
ice
one
foot
thick
we
shall
have
an
accelerating
cause
which
covers
all
the
loss
from
tidal
action
and
leaves
a
balance
of
a
second
per
annum
in
the
way
of
acceleration
if
tidal
retardation
can
be
thus
checked
and
overthrown
by
other
temporary
conditions
what
becomes
of
the
confident
assertion
based
upon
the
assumed
uniformity
of
tidal
retardation
that
ten
thousand
million
years
ago
the
earth
must
have
been
rotating
more
than
twice
as
fast
as
at
present
and
therefore
that
we
geologists
are
in
direct
opposition
to
the
principles
of
natural
philosophy
if
we
spread
geological
history
over
that
time
ii
the
second
argument
is
thus
stated
by
sir
thomson
an
article
by
myself
published
in
magazine
for
march
on
the
age
of
the
sun
heat
explains
results
of
investigation
into
various
questions
as
to
possibilities
regarding
the
amount
of
heat
that
the
sun
could
have
dealing
with
it
as
you
would
with
a
stone
or
a
piece
of
matter
only
taking
into
account
the
sun
dimensions
which
showed
it
to
be
possible
that
the
sun
may
have
already
illuminated
the
earth
for
as
many
as
one
hundred
million
years
but
at
the
same
time
rendered
it
almost
certain
that
he
had
not
illuminated
the
earth
for
five
hundred
millions
of
years
the
estimates
here
are
necessarily
very
vague
but
yet
vague
as
they
are
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
possible
upon
any
reasonable
estimate
founded
on
known
properties
of
matter
to
say
that
we
can
believe
the
sun
has
really
illuminated
the
earth
for
five
hundred
million
years
i
do
not
wish
to
hansardize
sir
william
thomson
by
laying
much
stress
on
the
fact
that
only
fifteen
years
ago
he
entertained
a
totally
different
view
of
the
origin
of
the
sun
heat
and
believed
that
the
energy
radiated
from
year
to
year
was
supplied
from
year
to
year
a
doctrine
which
would
have
suited
hutton
perfectly
but
the
fact
that
so
eminent
a
physical
philosopher
has
thus
recently
held
views
opposite
to
those
which
he
now
entertains
and
that
he
confesses
his
own
estimates
to
be
very
vague
justly
entitles
us
to
disregard
those
estimates
if
any
distinct
facts
on
our
side
go
against
them
however
i
am
not
aware
that
such
facts
exist
as
i
have
already
said
for
anything
i
know
one
two
or
three
hundred
millions
of
years
may
serve
the
needs
of
geologists
perfectly
well
iii
the
third
line
of
argument
is
based
upon
the
temperature
of
the
interior
of
the
earth
sir
thomson
refers
to
certain
investigations
which
prove
that
the
present
thermal
condition
of
the
interior
of
the
earth
implies
either
a
heating
of
the
earth
within
the
last
years
of
as
much
as
or
a
greater
heating
all
over
the
surface
at
some
time
further
back
than
years
and
then
proceeds
thus
now
are
geologists
prepared
to
admit
that
at
some
time
within
the
last
years
there
has
been
all
over
the
earth
so
high
a
temperature
as
that
i
presume
not
no
geologist
no
geologist
would
for
a
moment
admit
the
hypothesis
that
the
present
state
of
underground
heat
is
due
to
a
heating
of
the
surface
at
so
late
a
period
as
years
ago
if
that
is
not
admitted
we
are
driven
to
a
greater
heat
at
some
time
more
than
years
ago
a
greater
heating
all
over
the
surface
than
fahrenheit
would
kill
nearly
all
existing
plants
and
animals
i
may
safely
say
are
modern
geologists
prepared
to
say
that
all
life
was
killed
off
the
earth
or
years
ago
for
the
uniformity
theory
the
further
back
the
time
of
high
is
put
the
better
but
the
further
back
the
time
of
heating
the
hotter
it
must
have
been
the
best
for
those
who
draw
most
largely
on
time
is
that
which
puts
it
furthest
back
and
that
is
the
theory
that
the
heating
was
enough
to
melt
the
whole
but
even
if
it
was
enough
to
melt
the
whole
we
must
still
admit
some
limit
such
as
fifty
million
years
one
hundred
million
years
or
two
or
three
hundred
million
years
ago
beyond
that
we
can
not
go
it
will
be
observed
that
the
limit
is
once
again
of
the
vaguest
ranging
from
years
to
and
the
reply
is
once
more
that
for
anything
that
can
be
proved
to
the
contrary
one
or
two
hundred
million
years
might
serve
the
purpose
even
of
a
huttonian
uniformitarian
very
well
but
if
on
the
other
hand
the
or
years
appear
to
be
insufficient
for
geological
purposes
we
must
closely
criticise
the
method
by
which
the
limit
is
reached
the
argument
is
simple
enough
the
earth
to
be
nothing
but
a
cooling
mass
the
quantity
of
heat
lost
per
year
the
rate
of
cooling
to
have
been
uniform
multiplied
by
any
given
number
of
years
will
be
given
the
minimum
temperature
that
number
of
years
ago
but
is
the
earth
nothing
but
a
cooling
mass
like
a
jar
such
as
is
used
in
carriages
or
a
globe
of
sandstone
and
has
its
cooling
been
uniform
an
affirmative
answer
to
both
these
questions
seems
to
be
necessary
to
the
validity
of
the
calculations
on
which
sir
thomson
lays
so
much
stress
nevertheless
it
surely
may
be
urged
that
such
affirmative
answers
are
purely
hypothetical
and
that
other
suppositions
have
an
equal
right
to
consideration
for
example
is
it
not
possible
that
at
the
prodigious
temperature
which
would
seem
to
exist
at
miles
below
the
surface
all
the
metallic
bases
may
behave
as
mercury
does
at
a
red
heat
when
it
refuses
to
combine
with
oxygen
while
nearer
the
surface
and
therefore
at
a
lower
temperature
they
may
enter
into
combination
as
mercury
does
with
oxygen
a
few
degrees
below
its
and
so
give
rise
to
a
heat
totally
distinct
from
that
which
they
possess
as
cooling
bodies
and
has
it
not
also
been
proved
by
recent
researches
that
the
quality
of
the
atmosphere
may
immensely
affect
its
permeability
to
heat
and
consequently
profoundly
modify
the
rate
of
cooling
the
globe
as
a
whole
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
denied
that
such
conditions
may
exist
and
may
so
greatly
affect
the
supply
and
the
loss
of
terrestrial
heat
as
to
destroy
the
value
of
any
calculations
which
leave
them
out
of
sight
my
functions
as
your
advocate
are
at
an
end
i
speak
with
more
than
the
sincerity
of
a
mere
advocate
when
i
express
the
belief
that
the
case
against
us
has
entirely
broken
down
the
cry
for
reform
which
has
been
raised
without
is
superfluous
inasmuch
as
we
have
long
been
reforming
from
within
with
all
needful
speed
and
the
critical
examination
of
the
grounds
upon
which
the
very
grave
charge
of
opposition
to
the
principles
of
natural
philosophy
has
been
brought
against
us
rather
shows
that
we
have
exercised
a
wise
discrimination
in
declining
for
the
present
to
meddle
with
our
foundations

as
a

in

and
all
competent
naturalists
and
physiologists
whatever
their
opinions
as
to
the
ultimate
fate
of
the
doctrines
put
forth
acknowledge
that
the
work
in
which
they
are
embodied
is
a
solid
contribution
to
knowledge
and
inaugurates
a
new
epoch
in
natural
history
nor
has
the
discussion
of
the
subject
been
restrained
within
the
limits
of
conversation
when
the
public
is
eager
and
interested
reviewers
must
minister
to
its
wants
and
the
genuine
is
too
much
in
the
habit
of
acquiring
his
knowledge
from
the
book
he
judges
as
the
abyssinian
is
said
to
provide
himself
with
steaks
from
the
ox
which
carries
him
to
be
withheld
from
criticism
of
a
profound
scientific
work
by
the
mere
want
of
the
requisite
preliminary
scientific
acquirement
while
on
the
other
hand
the
men
of
science
who
wish
well
to
the
new
views
no
less
than
those
who
dispute
their
validity
have
naturally
sought
opportunities
of
expressing
their
opinions
hence
it
is
not
surprising
that
almost
all
the
critical
journals
have
noticed
darwin
work
at
greater
or
less
length
and
so
many
disquisitions
of
every
degree
of
excellence
from
the
poor
product
of
ignorance
too
often
stimulated
by
prejudice
to
the
fair
and
thoughtful
essay
of
the
candid
student
of
nature
have
appeared
that
it
seems
an
almost
hopeless
task
to
attempt
to
say
anything
new
upon
the
question
but
it
may
be
doubted
if
the
knowledge
and
acumen
of
prejudged
scientific
opponents
or
the
subtlety
of
orthodox
special
pleaders
have
yet
exerted
their
full
force
in
mystifying
the
real
issues
of
the
great
controversy
which
has
been
set
afoot
and
whose
end
is
hardly
likely
to
be
seen
by
this
generation
so
that
at
this
eleventh
hour
and
even
failing
anything
new
it
may
be
useful
to
state
afresh
that
which
is
true
and
to
put
the
fundamental
positions
advocated
by
darwin
in
such
a
form
that
they
may
be
grasped
by
those
whose
special
studies
lie
in
other
directions
and
the
adoption
of
this
course
may
be
the
more
advisable
because
notwithstanding
its
great
deserts
and
indeed
partly
on
account
of
them
the
origin
of
species
is
by
no
means
an
easy
book
to
read
if
by
reading
is
implied
the
full
comprehension
of
an
meaning
we
do
not
speak
jestingly
in
saying
that
it
is
darwin
misfortune
to
know
more
about
the
question
he
has
taken
up
than
any
man
living
personally
and
practically
exercised
in
zoology
in
minute
anatomy
in
geology
a
student
of
geographical
distribution
not
on
maps
and
in
museums
only
but
by
long
voyages
and
laborious
collection
having
largely
advanced
each
of
these
branches
of
science
and
having
spent
many
years
in
gathering
and
sifting
materials
for
his
present
work
the
store
of
accurately
registered
facts
upon
which
the
author
of
the
origin
of
species
is
able
to
draw
at
will
is
prodigious
but
this
very
superabundance
of
matter
must
have
been
embarrassing
to
a
writer
who
for
the
present
can
only
put
forward
an
abstract
of
his
views
and
thence
it
arises
perhaps
that
notwithstanding
the
clearness
of
the
style
those
who
attempt
fairly
to
digest
the
book
find
much
of
it
a
sort
of
intellectual
pemmican
a
mass
of
facts
crushed
and
pounded
into
shape
rather
than
held
together
by
the
ordinary
medium
of
an
obvious
logical
bond
due
attention
will
without
doubt
discover
this
bond
but
it
is
often
hard
to
find
again
from
sheer
want
of
room
much
has
to
be
taken
for
granted
which
might
readily
enough
be
proved
and
hence
while
the
adept
who
can
supply
the
missing
links
in
the
evidence
from
his
own
knowledge
discovers
fresh
proof
of
the
singular
thoroughness
with
which
all
difficulties
have
been
considered
and
all
unjustifiable
suppositions
avoided
at
every
reperusal
of
darwin
pregnant
paragraphs
the
novice
in
biology
is
apt
to
complain
of
the
frequency
of
what
he
fancies
is
gratuitous
assumption
thus
while
it
may
be
doubted
if
for
some
years
any
one
is
likely
to
be
competent
to
pronounce
judgment
on
all
the
issues
raised
by
darwin
there
is
assuredly
abundant
room
for
him
who
assuming
the
humbler
though
perhaps
as
useful
office
of
an
interpreter
between
the
origin
of
species
and
the
public
contents
himself
with
endeavouring
to
point
out
the
nature
of
the
problems
which
it
discusses
to
distinguish
between
the
ascertained
facts
and
the
theoretical
views
which
it
contains
and
finally
to
show
the
extent
to
which
the
explanation
it
offers
satisfies
the
requirements
of
scientific
logic
at
any
rate
it
is
this
office
which
we
propose
to
undertake
in
the
following
pages
it
may
be
safely
assumed
that
our
readers
have
a
general
conception
of
the
nature
of
the
objects
to
which
the
word
species
is
applied
but
it
has
perhaps
occurred
to
few
even
of
those
who
are
naturalists
to
reflect
that
as
commonly
employed
the
term
has
a
double
sense
and
denotes
two
very
different
orders
of
relations
when
we
call
a
group
of
animals
or
of
plants
a
species
we
may
imply
thereby
either
that
all
these
animals
or
plants
have
some
common
peculiarity
of
form
or
structure
or
we
may
mean
that
they
possess
some
common
functional
character
that
part
of
biological
science
which
deals
with
form
and
structure
is
called
morphology
that
which
concerns
itself
with
function
physiology
so
that
we
may
conveniently
speak
of
these
two
senses
or
aspects
of
species
the
one
as
morphological
the
other
as
physiological
regarded
from
the
former
point
of
view
a
species
is
nothing
more
than
a
kind
of
animal
or
plant
which
is
distinctly
definable
from
all
others
by
certain
constant
and
not
merely
sexual
morphological
peculiarities
thus
horses
form
a
species
because
the
group
of
animals
to
which
that
name
is
applied
is
distinguished
from
all
others
in
the
world
by
the
following
constantly
associated
characters
they
have
a
vertebral
column
mamm√¶
a
placental
embryo
four
legs
a
single
toe
in
each
foot
provided
with
a
hoof
a
bushy
tail
and
callosities
on
the
inner
sides
of
both
the
fore
and
the
hind
legs
the
asses
again
form
a
distinct
species
because
with
the
same
characters
as
far
as
the
fifth
in
the
above
list
all
asses
have
tufted
tails
and
have
callosities
only
on
the
inner
side
of
the
fore
legs
if
animals
were
discovered
having
the
general
characters
of
the
horse
but
sometimes
with
callosities
only
on
the
fore
legs
and
more
or
less
tufted
tails
or
animals
having
the
general
characters
of
the
ass
but
with
more
or
less
bushy
tails
and
sometimes
with
callosities
on
both
pairs
of
legs
besides
being
intermediate
in
other
respects
the
two
species
would
have
to
be
merged
into
one
they
could
no
longer
be
regarded
as
morphologically
distinct
species
for
they
would
not
be
distinctly
definable
one
from
the
other
however
bare
and
simple
this
definition
of
species
may
appear
to
be
we
confidently
appeal
to
all
practical
naturalists
whether
zoologists
botanists
or
pal√¶ontologists
to
say
if
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
they
know
or
mean
to
affirm
anything
more
of
the
group
of
animals
or
plants
they
so
denominate
than
what
has
just
been
stated
even
the
most
decided
advocates
of
the
received
doctrines
respecting
species
admit
this
i
apprehend
says
professor
owen
that
few
naturalists
in
describing
and
proposing
a
name
for
what
they
call
new
use
that
term
to
signify
what
was
meant
by
it
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
that
is
an
originally
distinct
creation
maintaining
its
primitive
distinction
by
obstructive
generative
peculiarities
the
proposer
of
the
new
species
now
intends
to
state
no
more
than
he
actually
knows
as
for
example
that
the
differences
on
which
he
founds
the
specific
character
are
constant
in
individuals
of
both
sexes
so
far
as
observation
has
reached
and
that
they
are
not
due
to
domestication
or
to
artificially
superinduced
external
circumstances
or
to
any
outward
influence
within
his
cognizance
that
the
species
is
wild
or
is
such
as
it
appears
by
nature
if
we
consider
in
fact
that
by
far
the
largest
proportion
of
recorded
existing
species
are
known
only
by
the
study
of
their
skins
or
bones
or
other
lifeless
exuvia
that
we
are
acquainted
with
none
or
next
to
none
of
their
physiological
peculiarities
beyond
those
which
can
be
deduced
from
their
structure
or
are
open
to
cursory
observation
and
that
we
can
not
hope
to
learn
more
of
any
of
those
extinct
forms
of
life
which
now
constitute
no
inconsiderable
proportion
of
the
known
flora
and
fauna
of
the
world
it
is
obvious
that
the
definitions
of
these
species
can
be
only
of
a
purely
structural
or
morphological
character
it
is
probable
that
naturalists
would
have
avoided
much
confusion
of
ideas
if
they
had
more
frequently
borne
these
necessary
limitations
of
our
knowledge
in
mind
but
while
it
may
safely
be
admitted
that
we
are
acquainted
with
only
the
morphological
characters
of
the
vast
majority
of
species
the
functional
or
physiological
peculiarities
of
a
few
have
been
carefully
investigated
and
the
result
of
that
study
forms
a
large
and
most
interesting
portion
of
the
physiology
of
reproduction
the
student
of
nature
wonders
the
more
and
is
astonished
the
less
the
more
conversant
he
becomes
with
her
operations
but
of
all
the
perennial
miracles
she
offers
to
his
inspection
perhaps
the
most
worthy
of
admiration
is
the
development
of
a
plant
or
of
an
animal
from
its
embryo
examine
the
recently
laid
egg
of
some
common
animal
such
as
a
salamander
or
a
newt
it
is
a
minute
spheroid
in
which
the
best
microscope
will
reveal
nothing
but
a
structureless
sac
enclosing
a
glairy
fluid
holding
granules
in
suspension
but
strange
possibilities
lie
dormant
in
that
globule
let
a
moderate
supply
of
warmth
reach
its
watery
cradle
and
the
plastic
matter
undergoes
changes
so
rapid
and
yet
so
steady
and
purposelike
in
their
succession
that
one
can
only
compare
them
to
those
operated
by
a
skilled
modeller
upon
a
formless
lump
of
clay
as
with
an
invisible
trowel
the
mass
is
divided
and
subdivided
into
smaller
and
smaller
portions
until
it
is
reduced
to
an
aggregation
of
granules
not
too
large
to
build
withal
the
finest
fabrics
of
the
nascent
organism
and
then
it
is
as
if
a
delicate
finger
traced
out
the
line
to
be
occupied
by
the
spinal
column
and
moulded
the
contour
of
the
body
pinching
up
the
head
at
one
end
the
tail
at
the
other
and
fashioning
flank
and
limb
into
due
salamandrine
proportions
in
so
artistic
a
way
that
after
watching
the
process
hour
by
hour
one
is
almost
involuntarily
possessed
by
the
notion
that
some
more
subtle
aid
to
vision
than
an
achromatic
would
show
the
hidden
artist
with
his
plan
before
him
striving
with
skilful
manipulation
to
perfect
his
work
as
life
advances
and
the
young
amphibian
ranges
the
waters
the
terror
of
his
insect
contemporaries
not
only
are
the
nutritious
particles
supplied
by
its
prey
by
the
addition
of
which
to
its
frame
growth
takes
place
laid
down
each
in
its
proper
spot
and
in
such
due
proportion
to
the
rest
as
to
reproduce
the
form
the
colour
and
the
size
characteristic
of
the
parental
stock
but
even
the
wonderful
powers
of
reproducing
lost
parts
possessed
by
these
animals
are
controlled
by
the
same
governing
tendency
cut
off
the
legs
the
tail
the
jaws
separately
or
all
together
and
as
spallanzani
showed
long
ago
these
parts
not
only
grow
again
but
the
redintegrated
limb
is
formed
on
the
same
type
as
those
which
were
lost
the
new
jaw
or
leg
is
a
newt
and
never
by
any
accident
more
like
that
of
a
frog
what
is
true
of
the
newt
is
true
of
every
animal
and
of
every
plant
the
acorn
tends
to
build
itself
up
again
into
a
woodland
giant
such
as
that
from
whose
twig
it
fell
the
spore
of
the
humblest
lichen
reproduces
the
green
or
brown
incrustation
which
gave
it
birth
and
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
of
life
the
child
that
resembled
neither
the
paternal
nor
the
maternal
side
of
the
house
would
be
regarded
as
a
kind
of
monster
so
that
the
one
end
to
which
in
all
living
beings
the
formative
impulse
is
tending
the
one
scheme
which
the
arch√¶us
of
the
old
speculators
strives
to
carry
out
seems
to
be
to
mould
the
offspring
into
the
likeness
of
the
parent
it
is
the
first
great
law
of
reproduction
that
the
offspring
tends
to
resemble
its
parent
or
parents
more
closely
than
anything
else
science
will
some
day
show
us
how
this
law
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
more
general
laws
which
govern
matter
but
for
the
present
more
can
hardly
be
said
than
that
it
appears
to
be
in
harmony
with
them
we
know
that
the
ph√¶nomena
of
vitality
are
not
something
apart
from
other
physical
ph√¶nomena
but
one
with
them
and
matter
and
force
are
the
two
names
of
the
one
artist
who
fashions
the
living
as
well
as
the
lifeless
hence
living
bodies
should
obey
the
same
great
laws
as
other
matter
nor
throughout
nature
is
there
a
law
of
wider
application
than
this
that
a
body
impelled
by
two
forces
takes
the
direction
of
their
resultant
but
living
bodies
may
be
regarded
as
nothing
but
extremely
complex
bundles
of
forces
held
in
a
mass
of
matter
as
the
complex
forces
of
a
magnet
are
held
in
the
steel
by
its
coercive
force
and
since
the
differences
of
sex
are
comparatively
slight
or
in
other
words
the
sum
of
the
forces
in
each
has
a
very
similar
tendency
their
resultant
the
offspring
may
reasonably
be
expected
to
deviate
but
little
from
a
course
parallel
to
either
or
to
both
represent
the
reason
of
the
law
to
ourselves
by
what
physical
metaphor
or
analogy
we
will
however
the
great
matter
is
to
apprehend
its
existence
and
the
importance
of
the
consequences
deducible
from
it
for
things
which
are
like
to
the
same
are
like
to
one
another
and
if
in
a
great
series
of
generations
every
offspring
is
like
its
parent
it
follows
that
all
the
offspring
and
all
the
parents
must
be
like
one
another
and
that
given
an
original
parental
stock
with
the
opportunity
of
undisturbed
multiplication
the
law
in
question
necessitates
the
production
in
course
of
time
of
an
indefinitely
large
group
the
whole
of
whose
members
are
at
once
very
similar
and
are
blood
relations
having
descended
from
the
same
parent
or
pair
of
parents
the
proof
that
all
the
members
of
any
given
group
of
animals
or
plants
had
thus
descended
would
be
ordinarily
considered
sufficient
to
entitle
them
to
the
rank
of
physiological
species
for
most
physiologists
consider
species
to
be
definable
as
the
offspring
of
a
single
primitive
stock
but
though
it
is
quite
true
that
all
those
groups
we
call
species
according
to
the
known
laws
of
reproduction
have
descended
from
a
single
stock
and
though
it
is
very
likely
they
really
have
done
so
yet
this
conclusion
rests
on
deduction
and
can
hardly
hope
to
establish
itself
upon
a
basis
of
observation
and
the
primitiveness
of
the
supposed
single
stock
which
after
all
is
the
essential
part
of
the
matter
is
not
only
a
hypothesis
but
one
which
has
not
a
shadow
of
foundation
if
by
primitive
be
meant
independent
of
any
other
living
being
a
scientific
definition
of
which
an
unwarrantable
hypothesis
forms
an
essential
part
carries
its
condemnation
within
itself
but
even
supposing
such
a
definition
were
in
form
tenable
the
physiologist
who
should
attempt
to
apply
it
in
nature
would
soon
find
himself
involved
in
great
if
not
inextricable
difficulties
as
we
have
said
it
is
indubitable
that
offspring
to
resemble
the
parental
organism
but
it
is
equally
true
that
the
similarity
attained
never
amounts
to
identity
either
in
form
or
in
structure
there
is
always
a
certain
amount
of
deviation
not
only
from
the
precise
characters
of
a
single
parent
but
when
as
in
most
animals
and
many
plants
the
sexes
are
lodged
in
distinct
individuals
from
an
exact
mean
between
the
two
parents
and
indeed
on
general
principles
this
slight
deviation
seems
as
intelligible
as
the
general
similarity
if
we
reflect
how
complex
the
bundles
of
forces
are
and
how
improbable
it
is
that
in
any
case
their
true
resultant
shall
coincide
with
any
mean
between
the
more
obvious
characters
of
the
two
parents
whatever
be
its
cause
however
the
of
this
tendency
to
minor
variation
with
the
tendency
to
general
similarity
is
of
vast
importance
in
its
bearing
on
the
question
of
the
origin
of
species
as
a
general
rule
the
extent
to
which
an
offspring
differs
from
its
parent
is
slight
enough
but
occasionally
the
amount
of
difference
is
much
more
strongly
marked
and
then
the
divergent
offspring
receives
the
name
of
a
variety
multitudes
of
what
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
are
such
varieties
are
known
but
the
origin
of
very
few
has
been
accurately
recorded
and
of
these
we
will
select
two
as
more
especially
illustrative
of
the
main
features
of
variation
the
first
of
them
is
that
of
the
ancon
or
otter
sheep
of
which
a
careful
account
is
given
by
colonel
david
humphreys
in
a
letter
to
sir
joseph
banks
published
in
the
philosophical
transactions
for
it
appears
that
one
seth
wright
the
proprietor
of
a
farm
on
the
banks
of
the
charles
river
in
massachusetts
possessed
a
flock
of
fifteen
ewes
and
a
ram
of
the
ordinary
kind
in
the
year
one
of
the
ewes
presented
her
owner
with
a
male
lamb
differing
for
no
assignable
reason
from
its
parents
by
a
proportionally
long
body
and
short
bandy
legs
whence
it
was
unable
to
emulate
its
relatives
in
those
sportive
leaps
over
the
neighbours
fences
in
which
they
were
in
the
habit
of
indulging
much
to
the
good
farmer
vexation
the
second
case
is
that
detailed
by
a
no
less
unexceptionable
authority
than
r√©aumur
in
his
art
de
faire
√©clore
les
poulets
a
maltese
couple
named
kelleia
whose
hands
and
feet
were
constructed
upon
the
ordinary
human
model
had
born
to
them
a
son
gratio
who
possessed
six
perfectly
moveable
fingers
on
each
hand
and
six
toes
not
quite
so
well
formed
on
each
foot
no
cause
could
be
assigned
for
the
appearance
of
this
unusual
variety
of
the
human
species
two
circumstances
are
well
worthy
of
remark
in
both
these
cases
in
each
the
variety
appears
to
have
arisen
in
full
force
and
as
it
were
a
wide
and
definite
difference
appearing
at
once
between
the
ancon
ram
and
the
ordinary
sheep
between
the
and
gratio
kelleia
and
ordinary
men
in
neither
case
is
it
possible
to
point
out
any
obvious
reason
for
the
appearance
of
the
variety
doubtless
there
were
determining
causes
for
these
as
for
all
other
ph√¶nomena
but
they
do
not
appear
and
we
can
be
tolerably
certain
that
what
are
ordinarily
understood
as
changes
in
physical
conditions
as
in
climate
in
food
or
the
like
did
not
take
place
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
it
was
no
case
of
what
is
commonly
called
adaptation
to
circumstances
but
to
use
a
conveniently
erroneous
phrase
the
variations
arose
spontaneously
the
fruitless
search
after
final
causes
leads
their
pursuers
a
long
way
but
even
those
hardy
teleologists
who
are
ready
to
break
through
all
the
laws
of
physics
in
chase
of
their
favourite
may
be
puzzled
to
discover
what
purpose
could
be
attained
by
the
stunted
legs
of
seth
wright
ram
or
the
hexadactyle
members
of
gratio
kelleia
varieties
then
arise
we
know
not
why
and
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
majority
of
varieties
have
arisen
in
this
spontaneous
manner
though
we
are
of
course
far
from
denying
that
they
may
be
traced
in
some
cases
to
distinct
external
influences
which
are
assuredly
competent
to
alter
the
character
of
the
tegumentary
covering
to
change
colour
to
increase
or
diminish
the
size
of
muscles
to
modify
constitution
and
among
plants
to
give
rise
to
the
metamorphosis
of
stamens
into
petals
and
so
forth
but
however
they
may
have
arisen
what
especially
interests
us
at
present
is
to
remark
that
once
in
existence
varieties
obey
the
fundamental
law
of
reproduction
that
like
tends
to
produce
like
and
their
offspring
exemplify
it
by
tending
to
exhibit
the
same
deviation
from
the
parental
stock
as
themselves
indeed
there
seems
to
be
in
many
instances
a
influence
about
a
variety
which
gives
it
what
one
may
call
an
unfair
advantage
over
the
normal
descendants
from
the
same
stock
this
is
strikingly
exemplified
by
the
case
of
gratio
kelleia
who
married
a
woman
with
the
ordinary
pentadactyle
extremities
and
had
by
her
four
children
salvator
george
andr√©
and
marie
of
these
children
salvator
the
eldest
boy
had
six
fingers
and
six
toes
like
his
father
the
second
and
third
also
boys
had
five
fingers
and
five
toes
like
their
mother
though
the
hands
and
feet
of
george
were
slightly
deformed
the
last
a
girl
had
five
fingers
and
five
toes
but
the
thumbs
were
slightly
deformed
the
variety
thus
reproduced
itself
purely
in
the
eldest
while
the
normal
type
reproduced
itself
purely
in
the
third
and
almost
purely
in
the
second
and
last
so
that
it
would
seem
at
first
as
if
the
normal
type
were
more
powerful
than
the
variety
but
all
these
children
grew
up
and
intermarried
with
normal
wives
and
husband
and
then
note
what
took
place
salvator
had
four
children
three
of
whom
exhibited
the
hexadactyle
members
of
their
grandfather
and
father
while
the
youngest
had
the
pentadactyle
limbs
of
the
mother
and
grandmother
so
that
here
notwithstanding
a
double
pentadactyle
dilution
of
the
blood
the
hexadactyle
variety
had
the
best
of
it
the
same
of
the
variety
was
still
more
markedly
exemplified
in
the
progeny
of
two
of
the
other
children
marie
and
george
marie
whose
thumbs
only
were
deformed
gave
birth
to
a
boy
with
six
toes
and
three
other
normally
formed
children
but
george
who
was
not
quite
so
pure
a
pentadactyle
begot
first
two
girls
each
of
whom
had
six
fingers
and
toes
then
a
girl
with
six
fingers
on
each
hand
and
six
toes
on
the
right
foot
but
only
five
toes
on
the
left
and
lastly
a
boy
with
only
five
fingers
and
toes
in
these
instances
therefore
the
variety
as
it
were
leaped
over
one
generation
to
reproduce
itself
in
full
force
in
the
next
finally
the
purely
pentadactyle
andr√©
was
the
father
of
many
children
not
one
of
whom
departed
from
the
normal
parental
type
if
a
variation
which
approaches
the
nature
of
a
monstrosity
can
strive
thus
forcibly
to
reproduce
itself
it
is
not
wonderful
that
less
aberrant
modifications
should
tend
to
be
preserved
even
more
strongly
and
the
history
of
the
ancon
sheep
is
in
this
respect
particularly
instructive
with
the
characteristic
of
their
nation
the
neighbours
of
the
massachusetts
farmer
imagined
it
would
be
an
excellent
thing
if
all
his
sheep
were
imbued
with
the
tendencies
enforced
by
nature
upon
the
ram
and
they
advised
wright
to
kill
the
old
patriarch
of
his
fold
and
install
the
ancon
ram
in
his
place
the
result
justified
their
sagacious
anticipations
and
coincided
very
nearly
with
what
occurred
to
the
progeny
of
gratio
kelleia
the
young
lambs
were
almost
always
either
pure
ancons
or
pure
ordinary
sheep
but
when
sufficient
ancon
sheep
were
obtained
to
interbreed
with
one
another
it
was
found
that
the
offspring
was
always
pure
ancon
colonel
humphreys
in
fact
states
that
he
was
acquainted
with
only
one
questionable
case
of
a
contrary
nature
here
then
is
a
remarkable
and
instance
not
only
of
a
very
distinct
race
being
established
but
of
that
race
breeding
true
at
once
and
showing
no
mixed
forms
even
when
crossed
with
another
breed
by
taking
care
to
select
ancons
of
both
sexes
for
breeding
from
it
thus
became
easy
to
establish
an
extremely
race
so
peculiar
that
even
when
herded
with
other
sheep
it
was
noted
that
the
ancons
kept
together
and
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
existence
of
this
breed
might
have
been
indefinitely
protracted
but
the
introduction
of
the
merino
sheep
which
were
not
only
very
superior
to
the
ancons
in
wool
and
meat
but
quite
as
quiet
and
orderly
led
to
the
complete
neglect
of
the
new
breed
so
that
in
colonel
humphreys
found
it
difficult
to
obtain
the
specimen
whose
skeleton
was
presented
to
sir
joseph
banks
we
believe
that
for
many
years
no
remnant
of
it
has
existed
in
the
united
states
gratio
kelleia
was
not
the
progenitor
of
a
race
of
men
as
seth
wright
ram
became
a
nation
of
ancon
sheep
though
the
tendency
of
the
variety
to
perpetuate
itself
appears
to
have
been
fully
as
strong
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
and
the
reason
of
the
difference
is
not
far
to
seek
seth
wright
took
care
not
to
weaken
the
ancon
blood
by
matching
his
ancon
ewes
with
any
but
males
of
the
same
variety
while
gratio
kelleia
sons
were
too
far
removed
from
the
patriarchal
times
to
intermarry
with
their
sisters
and
his
grandchildren
seem
not
to
have
been
attracted
by
their
cousins
in
other
words
in
the
one
example
a
race
was
produced
because
for
several
generations
care
was
taken
to
both
parents
of
the
breeding
stock
from
animals
exhibiting
a
tendency
to
vary
in
the
same
direction
while
in
the
other
no
race
was
evolved
because
no
such
selection
was
exercised
a
race
is
a
propagated
variety
and
as
by
the
laws
of
reproduction
offspring
tend
to
assume
the
parental
form
they
will
be
more
likely
to
propagate
a
variation
exhibited
by
both
parents
than
that
possessed
by
only
one
there
is
no
organ
of
the
body
of
an
animal
which
may
not
and
does
not
occasionally
vary
more
or
less
from
the
normal
type
and
there
is
no
variation
which
may
not
be
transmitted
and
which
if
selectively
transmitted
may
not
become
the
foundation
of
a
race
this
great
truth
sometimes
forgotten
by
philosophers
has
long
been
familiar
to
practical
agriculturists
and
breeders
and
upon
it
rest
all
the
methods
of
improving
the
breeds
of
domestic
animals
which
for
the
last
century
have
been
followed
with
so
much
success
in
england
colour
form
size
texture
of
hair
or
wool
proportions
of
various
parts
strength
or
weakness
of
constitution
tendency
to
fatten
or
to
remain
lean
to
give
much
or
little
milk
speed
strength
temper
intelligence
special
instincts
there
is
not
one
of
these
characters
whose
transmission
is
not
an
occurrence
within
the
experience
of
and
dog
and
poultry
fanciers
nay
it
is
only
the
other
day
that
an
eminent
physiologist
communicated
to
the
royal
society
his
discovery
that
epilepsy
artificially
produced
in
by
a
means
which
he
has
discovered
is
transmitted
to
their
offspring
but
a
race
once
produced
is
no
more
a
fixed
and
immutable
entity
than
the
stock
whence
it
sprang
variations
arise
among
its
members
and
as
these
variations
are
transmitted
like
any
others
new
races
may
be
developed
out
of
the
ones
or
at
least
within
any
limit
at
present
determined
given
sufficient
time
and
sufficiently
careful
selection
and
the
multitude
of
races
which
may
arise
from
a
common
stock
is
as
astonishing
as
are
the
extreme
structural
differences
which
they
may
present
a
remarkable
example
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
the
which
darwin
has
in
our
opinion
satisfactorily
demonstrated
to
be
the
progenitor
of
all
our
domestic
pigeons
of
which
there
are
certainly
more
than
a
hundred
races
the
most
noteworthy
of
these
races
are
the
four
great
stocks
known
to
the
fancy
as
tumblers
pouters
carriers
and
fantails
birds
which
not
only
differ
most
singularly
in
size
colour
and
habits
but
in
the
form
of
the
beak
and
of
the
skull
in
the
proportions
of
the
beak
to
the
skull
in
the
number
of
in
the
absolute
and
relative
size
of
the
feet
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
the
uropygial
gland
in
the
number
of
vertebr√¶
in
the
back
in
short
in
precisely
those
characters
in
which
the
genera
and
species
of
birds
differ
from
one
another
and
it
is
most
remarkable
and
instructive
to
observe
that
none
of
these
races
can
be
shown
to
have
been
originated
by
the
action
of
changes
in
what
are
commonly
called
external
circumstances
upon
the
wild
on
the
contrary
from
time
immemorial
pigeon
fanciers
have
had
essentially
similar
methods
of
treating
their
pets
which
have
been
housed
fed
protected
and
cared
for
in
much
the
same
way
in
all
pigeonries
in
fact
there
is
no
case
better
adapted
than
that
of
the
pigeons
to
refute
the
doctrine
which
one
sees
put
forth
on
high
authority
that
no
other
characters
than
those
founded
on
the
development
of
bone
for
the
attachment
of
muscles
are
capable
of
variation
in
precise
contradiction
of
this
hasty
assertion
darwin
researches
prove
that
the
skeleton
of
the
wings
in
domestic
pigeons
has
hardly
varied
at
all
from
that
of
the
wild
type
while
on
the
other
hand
it
is
in
exactly
those
respects
such
as
the
relative
length
of
the
beak
and
skull
the
number
of
the
vertebr√¶
and
the
number
of
the
in
which
muscular
exertion
can
have
no
important
influence
that
the
utmost
amount
of
variation
has
taken
place
we
have
said
that
the
following
out
of
the
properties
exhibited
by
physiological
species
would
lead
us
into
difficulties
and
at
this
point
they
begin
to
be
obvious
for
if
as
a
result
of
spontaneous
variation
and
of
selective
breeding
the
progeny
of
a
common
stock
may
become
separated
into
groups
distinguished
from
one
another
by
constant
not
sexual
morphological
characters
it
is
clear
that
the
physiological
definition
of
species
is
likely
to
clash
with
the
morphological
definition
no
one
would
hesitate
to
describe
the
pouter
and
the
tumbler
as
distinct
species
if
they
were
found
fossil
or
if
their
skins
and
skeletons
were
imported
as
those
of
exotic
wild
birds
commonly
are
and
without
doubt
if
considered
alone
they
are
good
and
distinct
morphological
species
on
the
other
hand
they
are
not
physiological
species
for
they
are
descended
from
a
common
stock
the
under
these
circumstances
as
it
is
admitted
on
all
sides
that
races
occur
in
nature
how
are
we
to
know
whether
any
apparently
distinct
animals
are
really
of
different
physiological
species
or
not
seeing
that
the
amount
of
morphological
difference
is
no
safe
guide
is
there
any
test
of
a
physiological
species
the
usual
answer
of
physiologists
is
in
the
affirmative
it
is
said
that
such
a
test
is
to
be
found
in
the
ph√¶nomena
of
hybridization
in
the
results
of
crossing
races
as
compared
with
the
results
of
crossing
species
so
far
as
the
evidence
goes
at
present
individuals
of
what
are
certainly
known
to
be
mere
races
produced
by
selection
however
distinct
they
may
appear
to
be
not
only
breed
freely
together
but
the
offspring
of
such
crossed
races
are
only
perfectly
fertile
with
one
another
thus
the
spaniel
and
the
greyhound
the
and
the
arab
the
pouter
and
the
tumbler
breed
together
with
perfect
freedom
and
their
mongrels
if
matched
with
other
mongrels
of
the
same
kind
are
equally
fertile
on
the
other
hand
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
individuals
of
many
natural
species
are
either
absolutely
infertile
if
crossed
with
individuals
of
other
species
or
if
they
give
rise
to
hybrid
offspring
the
hybrids
so
produced
are
infertile
when
paired
together
the
horse
and
the
ass
for
instance
if
so
crossed
give
rise
to
the
mule
and
there
is
no
certain
evidence
of
offspring
ever
having
been
produced
by
a
male
and
female
mule
the
unions
of
the
and
the
appear
to
be
equally
barren
of
result
here
then
says
the
physiologist
we
have
a
means
of
distinguishing
any
two
true
species
from
any
two
varieties
if
a
male
and
a
female
selected
from
each
group
produce
offspring
and
that
offspring
is
fertile
with
others
produced
in
the
same
way
the
groups
are
races
and
not
species
if
on
the
other
hand
no
result
ensues
or
if
the
offspring
are
infertile
with
others
produced
in
the
same
way
they
are
true
physiological
species
the
test
would
be
an
admirable
one
if
in
the
first
place
it
were
always
practicable
to
apply
it
and
if
in
the
second
it
always
yielded
results
susceptible
of
a
definite
interpretation
unfortunately
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
this
touchstone
for
species
is
wholly
inapplicable
the
constitution
of
many
wild
animals
is
so
altered
by
confinement
that
they
will
not
breed
even
with
their
own
females
so
that
the
negative
results
obtained
from
crosses
are
of
no
value
and
the
antipathy
of
wild
animals
of
different
species
for
one
another
or
even
of
wild
and
tame
members
of
the
same
species
is
ordinarily
so
great
that
it
is
hopeless
to
look
for
such
unions
in
nature
the
hermaphrodism
of
most
plants
the
difficulty
in
the
way
of
ensuring
the
absence
of
their
own
or
the
proper
working
of
other
pollen
are
obstacles
of
no
less
magnitude
in
applying
the
test
to
them
and
in
both
animals
and
plants
is
superadded
the
further
difficulty
that
experiments
must
be
continued
over
a
long
time
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
fertility
of
the
mongrel
or
hybrid
progeny
as
well
as
of
the
first
crosses
from
which
they
spring
not
only
do
these
great
practical
difficulties
lie
in
the
way
of
applying
the
hybridization
test
but
even
when
this
oracle
can
be
questioned
its
replies
are
sometimes
as
doubtful
as
those
of
delphi
for
example
cases
are
cited
by
darwin
of
plants
which
are
more
fertile
with
the
pollen
of
another
species
than
with
their
own
and
there
are
others
such
as
certain
whose
male
element
will
fertilize
the
ovule
of
a
plant
of
distinct
species
while
the
males
of
the
latter
species
are
ineffective
with
the
females
of
the
first
so
that
in
the
instance
a
physiologist
who
should
cross
the
two
species
in
one
way
would
decide
that
they
were
true
species
while
another
who
should
cross
them
in
the
reverse
way
would
with
equal
justice
according
to
the
rule
pronounce
them
to
be
mere
races
several
plants
which
there
is
great
reason
to
believe
are
mere
varieties
are
almost
sterile
when
crossed
while
both
animals
and
plants
which
have
always
been
regarded
by
naturalists
as
of
distinct
species
turn
out
when
the
test
is
applied
to
be
perfectly
fertile
again
the
sterility
or
fertility
of
crosses
seems
to
bear
no
relation
to
the
structural
resemblances
or
differences
of
the
members
of
any
two
groups
darwin
has
discussed
this
question
with
singular
ability
and
circumspection
and
his
conclusions
are
summed
up
as
follow
at
page
of
his
work
first
crosses
between
forms
sufficiently
distinct
to
be
ranked
as
species
and
their
hybrids
are
very
generally
but
not
universally
sterile
the
sterility
is
of
all
degrees
and
is
often
so
slight
that
the
two
most
careful
experimentalists
who
have
ever
lived
have
come
to
diametrically
opposite
conclusions
in
ranking
forms
by
this
test
the
sterility
is
innately
variable
in
individuals
of
the
same
species
and
is
eminently
susceptible
of
favourable
and
unfavourable
conditions
the
degree
of
sterility
does
not
strictly
follow
systematic
affinity
but
is
governed
by
several
curious
and
complex
laws
it
is
generally
different
and
sometimes
widely
different
in
reciprocal
crosses
between
the
same
two
species
it
is
not
always
equal
in
degree
in
a
first
cross
and
in
the
hybrid
produced
from
this
cross
in
the
same
manner
as
in
grafting
trees
the
capacity
of
one
species
or
variety
to
take
on
another
is
incidental
on
generally
unknown
differences
in
their
vegetative
systems
so
in
crossing
the
greater
or
less
facility
of
one
species
to
unite
with
another
is
incidental
on
unknown
differences
in
their
reproductive
systems
there
is
no
more
reason
to
think
that
species
have
been
specially
endowed
with
various
degrees
of
sterility
to
prevent
them
crossing
and
breeding
in
nature
than
to
think
that
trees
have
been
specially
endowed
with
various
and
somewhat
analogous
degrees
of
difficulty
in
being
grafted
together
in
order
to
prevent
them
becoming
inarched
in
our
forests
the
sterility
of
first
crosses
between
pure
species
which
have
their
reproductive
systems
perfect
seems
to
depend
on
several
circumstances
in
some
cases
largely
on
the
early
death
of
the
embryo
the
sterility
of
hybrids
which
have
their
reproductive
systems
imperfect
and
which
have
had
this
system
and
their
whole
organization
disturbed
by
being
compounded
of
two
distinct
species
seems
closely
allied
to
that
sterility
which
so
frequently
affects
pure
species
when
their
natural
conditions
of
life
have
been
disturbed
this
view
is
supported
by
a
parallelism
of
another
kind
namely
that
the
crossing
of
forms
only
slightly
different
is
favourable
to
the
vigour
and
fertility
of
the
offspring
and
that
slight
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
are
apparently
favourable
to
the
vigour
and
fertility
of
all
organic
beings
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
degree
of
difficulty
in
uniting
two
species
and
the
degree
of
sterility
of
their
hybrid
offspring
should
generally
correspond
though
due
to
distinct
causes
for
both
depend
on
the
amount
of
difference
of
some
kind
between
the
species
which
are
crossed
nor
is
it
surprising
that
the
facility
of
effecting
a
first
cross
the
fertility
of
hybrids
produced
from
it
and
the
capacity
of
being
grafted
together
though
this
latter
capacity
evidently
depends
on
widely
different
circumstances
should
all
run
to
a
certain
extent
parallel
with
the
systematic
affinity
of
the
forms
which
are
subjected
to
experiment
for
systematic
affinity
attempts
to
express
all
kinds
of
resemblance
between
all
species
first
crosses
between
forms
known
to
be
varieties
or
sufficiently
alike
to
be
considered
as
varieties
and
their
mongrel
offspring
are
very
generally
but
not
quite
universally
fertile
nor
is
this
nearly
general
and
perfect
fertility
surprising
when
we
remember
how
liable
we
are
to
argue
in
a
circle
with
respect
to
varieties
in
a
state
of
nature
and
when
we
remember
that
the
greater
number
of
varieties
have
been
produced
under
domestication
by
the
selection
of
mere
external
differences
and
not
of
differences
in
the
reproductive
system
in
all
other
respects
excluding
fertility
there
is
a
close
general
resemblance
between
hybrids
and
pp
we
fully
agree
with
the
general
tenor
of
this
weighty
passage
but
forcible
as
are
these
arguments
and
little
as
the
value
of
fertility
or
infertility
as
a
test
of
species
may
be
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
really
important
fact
so
far
as
the
inquiry
into
the
origin
of
species
goes
is
that
there
are
such
things
in
nature
as
groups
of
animals
and
of
plants
whose
members
are
incapable
of
fertile
union
with
those
of
other
groups
and
that
there
are
such
things
as
hybrids
which
are
absolutely
sterile
when
crossed
with
other
hybrids
for
if
such
ph√¶nomena
as
these
were
exhibited
by
only
two
of
those
assemblages
of
living
objects
to
which
the
name
of
species
whether
it
be
used
in
its
physiological
or
in
its
morphological
sense
is
given
it
would
have
to
be
accounted
for
by
any
theory
of
the
origin
of
species
and
every
theory
which
could
not
account
for
it
would
be
so
far
imperfect
up
to
this
point
we
have
been
dealing
with
matters
of
fact
and
the
statements
which
we
have
laid
before
the
reader
would
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
be
admitted
to
contain
a
fair
exposition
of
what
is
at
present
known
respecting
the
essential
properties
of
species
by
all
who
have
studied
the
question
and
whatever
may
be
his
theoretical
views
no
naturalist
will
probably
be
disposed
to
demur
to
the
following
summary
of
that
exposition
living
beings
whether
animals
or
plants
are
divisible
into
multitudes
of
distinctly
definable
kinds
which
are
morphological
species
they
are
also
divisible
into
groups
of
individuals
which
breed
freely
together
tending
to
reproduce
their
like
and
are
physiological
species
normally
resembling
their
parents
the
offspring
of
members
of
these
species
are
still
liable
to
vary
and
the
variation
may
be
perpetuated
by
selection
as
a
race
which
race
in
many
cases
presents
all
the
characteristics
of
a
morphological
species
but
it
is
not
as
yet
proved
that
a
race
ever
exhibits
when
crossed
with
another
race
of
the
same
species
those
ph√¶nomena
of
hybridization
which
are
exhibited
by
many
species
when
crossed
with
other
species
on
the
other
hand
not
only
is
it
not
proved
that
all
species
give
rise
to
hybrids
infertile
but
there
is
much
reason
to
believe
that
in
crossing
species
exhibit
every
gradation
from
perfect
sterility
to
perfect
fertility
such
are
the
most
essential
characteristics
of
species
even
were
man
not
one
of
them
a
member
of
the
same
system
and
subject
to
the
same
laws
the
question
of
their
origin
their
causal
connexion
that
is
with
the
other
ph√¶nomena
of
the
universe
must
have
attracted
his
attention
as
soon
as
his
intelligence
had
raised
itself
above
the
level
of
his
daily
wants
indeed
history
relates
that
such
was
the
case
and
has
embalmed
for
us
the
speculations
upon
the
origin
of
living
beings
which
were
among
the
earliest
products
of
the
dawning
intellectual
activity
of
man
in
those
early
days
positive
knowledge
was
not
to
be
had
but
the
craving
after
it
needed
at
all
hazards
to
be
satisfied
and
according
to
the
country
or
the
turn
of
thought
of
the
speculator
the
suggestion
that
all
living
things
arose
from
the
mud
of
the
nile
from
a
primeval
egg
or
from
some
more
anthropomorphic
agency
afforded
a
sufficient
for
his
curiosity
the
myths
of
paganism
are
as
dead
as
osiris
or
zeus
and
the
man
who
should
revive
them
in
opposition
to
the
knowledge
of
our
time
would
be
justly
laughed
to
scorn
but
the
coeval
imaginations
current
among
the
rude
inhabitants
of
palestine
recorded
by
writers
whose
very
name
and
age
are
admitted
by
every
scholar
to
be
unknown
have
unfortunately
not
yet
shared
their
fate
but
even
at
this
day
are
regarded
by
of
the
civilized
world
as
the
authoritative
standard
of
fact
and
the
criterion
of
the
justice
of
scientific
conclusions
in
all
that
relates
to
the
origin
of
things
and
among
them
of
species
in
this
nineteenth
century
as
at
the
dawn
of
modern
physical
science
the
cosmogony
of
the
hebrew
is
the
incubus
of
the
philosopher
and
the
opprobrium
of
the
orthodox
who
shall
number
the
patient
and
earnest
seekers
after
truth
from
the
days
of
galileo
until
now
whose
lives
have
been
embittered
and
their
good
name
blasted
by
the
mistaken
zeal
of
bibliolaters
who
shall
count
the
host
of
weaker
men
whose
sense
of
truth
has
been
destroyed
in
the
effort
to
harmonize
impossibilities
whose
life
has
been
wasted
in
the
attempt
to
force
the
generous
new
wine
of
science
into
the
old
bottles
of
judaism
compelled
by
the
outcry
of
the
same
strong
party
it
is
true
that
if
philosophers
have
suffered
their
cause
has
been
amply
avenged
extinguished
theologians
lie
about
the
cradle
of
every
science
as
the
strangled
snakes
beside
that
of
hercules
and
history
records
that
whenever
science
and
orthodoxy
have
been
fairly
opposed
the
latter
has
been
forced
to
retire
from
the
lists
bleeding
and
crushed
if
not
annihilated
scotched
if
not
slain
but
orthodoxy
is
the
bourbon
of
the
world
of
thought
it
learns
not
neither
can
it
forget
and
though
at
present
bewildered
and
afraid
to
move
it
is
as
willing
as
ever
to
insist
that
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
contains
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
sound
science
and
to
visit
with
such
petty
thunderbolts
as
its
hands
can
hurl
those
who
refuse
to
degrade
nature
to
the
level
of
primitive
judaism
philosophers
on
the
other
hand
have
no
such
aggressive
tendencies
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
noble
goal
to
which
per
aspera
et
ardua
they
tend
they
may
now
and
then
be
stirred
to
momentary
wrath
by
the
unnecessary
obstacles
with
which
the
ignorant
or
the
malicious
encumber
if
they
can
not
bar
the
difficult
path
but
why
should
their
souls
be
deeply
vexed
the
majesty
of
fact
is
on
their
side
and
the
elemental
forces
of
nature
are
working
for
them
not
a
star
comes
to
the
meridian
at
its
calculated
time
but
testifies
to
the
justice
of
their
methods
their
beliefs
are
one
with
the
falling
rain
and
with
the
growing
corn
by
doubt
they
are
established
and
open
inquiry
is
their
bosom
friend
such
men
have
no
fear
of
traditions
however
venerable
and
no
respect
for
them
when
they
become
mischievous
and
obstructive
but
they
have
better
than
mere
antiquarian
business
in
hand
and
if
dogmas
which
ought
to
be
fossil
but
are
not
are
not
forced
upon
their
notice
they
are
too
happy
to
treat
them
as
the
hypotheses
respecting
the
origin
of
species
which
profess
to
stand
upon
a
scientific
basis
and
as
such
alone
demand
serious
attention
are
of
two
kinds
the
one
the
special
creation
hypothesis
presumes
every
species
to
have
originated
from
one
or
more
stocks
these
not
being
the
result
of
the
modification
of
any
other
form
of
living
matter
or
arising
by
natural
agencies
but
being
produced
as
such
by
a
supernatural
creative
act
the
other
the
transmutation
hypothesis
considers
that
all
existing
species
are
the
result
of
the
modification
of
species
and
those
of
their
predecessors
by
agencies
similar
to
those
which
at
the
present
day
produce
varieties
and
races
and
therefore
in
an
altogether
natural
way
and
it
is
a
probable
though
not
a
necessary
consequence
of
this
hypothesis
that
all
living
beings
have
arisen
from
a
single
stock
with
respect
to
the
origin
of
this
primitive
stock
or
stocks
the
doctrine
of
the
origin
of
species
is
obviously
not
necessarily
concerned
the
transmutation
hypothesis
for
example
is
perfectly
consistent
either
with
the
conception
of
a
special
creation
of
the
primitive
germ
or
with
the
supposition
of
its
having
arisen
as
a
modification
of
inorganic
matter
by
natural
causes
the
doctrine
of
special
creation
owes
its
existence
very
largely
to
the
supposed
necessity
of
making
science
accord
with
the
hebrew
cosmogony
but
it
is
curious
to
observe
that
as
the
doctrine
is
at
present
maintained
by
men
of
science
it
is
as
hopelessly
inconsistent
with
the
hebrew
view
as
any
other
hypothesis
if
there
be
any
result
which
has
come
more
clearly
out
of
geological
investigation
than
another
it
is
that
the
vast
series
of
extinct
animals
and
plants
is
not
divisible
as
it
was
once
supposed
to
be
into
distinct
groups
separated
by
sharply
marked
boundaries
there
are
no
great
gulfs
between
epochs
and
formations
no
successive
periods
marked
by
the
appearance
of
plants
of
water
animals
and
of
land
animals
every
year
adds
to
the
list
of
links
between
what
the
older
geologists
supposed
to
be
widely
separated
epochs
witness
the
crags
linking
the
drift
with
the
older
tertiaries
the
maestricht
beds
linking
the
tertiaries
with
the
chalk
the
cassian
beds
exhibiting
an
abundant
fauna
of
mixed
mesozoic
and
pal√¶ozoic
types
in
rocks
of
an
epoch
once
supposed
to
be
eminently
poor
in
life
witness
lastly
the
incessant
disputes
as
to
whether
a
given
stratum
shall
be
reckoned
devonian
or
carboniferous
silurian
or
devonian
cambrian
or
silurian
this
truth
is
further
illustrated
in
a
most
interesting
manner
by
the
impartial
and
highly
competent
testimony
of
pictet
from
whose
calculations
of
what
percentage
of
the
genera
of
animals
existing
in
any
formation
lived
during
the
preceding
formation
it
results
that
in
no
case
is
the
proportion
less
than
or
per
cent
it
is
the
triassic
formation
or
the
commencement
of
the
mesozoic
epoch
which
has
received
this
smallest
inheritance
from
preceding
ages
the
other
formations
not
uncommonly
exhibit
or
even
per
cent
of
genera
in
common
with
those
whose
remains
are
imbedded
in
their
predecessor
not
only
is
this
true
but
the
subdivisions
of
each
formation
exhibit
new
species
characteristic
of
and
found
only
in
them
and
in
many
cases
as
in
the
lias
for
example
the
separate
beds
of
these
subdivisions
are
distinguished
by
and
peculiar
forms
of
life
a
section
a
hundred
feet
thick
will
exhibit
at
different
heights
a
dozen
species
of
ammonite
none
of
which
passes
beyond
its
particular
zone
of
limestone
or
clay
into
the
zone
below
it
or
into
that
above
it
so
that
those
who
adopt
the
doctrine
of
special
creation
must
be
prepared
to
admit
that
at
intervals
of
time
corresponding
with
the
thickness
of
these
beds
the
creator
thought
fit
to
interfere
with
the
natural
course
of
events
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
new
ammonite
it
is
not
easy
to
transplant
oneself
into
the
frame
of
mind
of
those
who
can
accept
such
a
conclusion
as
this
on
any
evidence
short
of
absolute
demonstration
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
is
to
be
gained
by
so
doing
since
as
we
have
said
it
is
obvious
that
such
a
view
of
the
origin
of
living
beings
is
utterly
opposed
to
the
hebrew
cosmogony
deserving
no
aid
from
the
powerful
arm
of
bibliolatry
then
does
the
received
form
of
the
hypothesis
of
special
creation
derive
any
support
from
science
or
sound
logic
assuredly
not
much
the
arguments
brought
forward
in
its
favour
all
take
one
form
if
species
were
not
supernaturally
created
we
can
not
understand
the
facts
or
or
we
can
not
understand
the
structure
of
animals
or
plants
unless
we
suppose
they
were
contrived
for
special
ends
we
can
not
understand
the
structure
of
the
eye
except
by
supposing
it
to
have
been
made
to
see
with
we
can
not
understand
instincts
unless
we
suppose
animals
to
have
been
miraculously
endowed
with
them
as
a
question
of
dialectics
it
must
be
admitted
that
this
sort
of
reasoning
is
not
very
formidable
to
those
who
are
not
to
be
frightened
by
consequences
it
is
an
ad
take
this
explanation
or
be
ignorant
but
suppose
we
prefer
to
admit
our
ignorance
rather
than
adopt
a
hypothesis
at
variance
with
all
the
teachings
of
nature
or
suppose
for
a
moment
we
admit
the
explanation
and
then
seriously
ask
ourselves
how
much
the
wiser
are
we
what
does
the
explanation
explain
is
it
any
more
than
a
grandiloquent
way
of
announcing
the
fact
that
we
really
know
nothing
about
the
matter
a
phenomenon
is
explained
when
it
is
shown
to
be
a
case
of
some
general
law
of
nature
but
the
supernatural
interposition
of
the
creator
can
by
the
nature
of
the
case
exemplify
no
law
and
if
species
have
really
arisen
in
this
way
it
is
absurd
to
attempt
to
discuss
their
origin
or
lastly
let
us
ask
ourselves
whether
any
amount
of
evidence
which
the
nature
of
our
faculties
permits
us
to
attain
can
justify
us
in
asserting
that
any
ph√¶nomenon
is
out
of
the
reach
of
natural
causation
to
this
end
it
is
obviously
necessary
that
we
should
know
all
the
consequences
to
which
all
possible
combinations
continued
through
unlimited
time
can
give
rise
if
we
knew
these
and
found
none
competent
to
originate
species
we
should
have
good
ground
for
denying
their
origin
by
natural
causation
till
we
know
them
any
hypothesis
is
better
than
one
which
involves
us
in
such
miserable
presumption
but
the
hypothesis
of
special
creation
is
not
only
a
mere
specious
mask
for
our
ignorance
its
existence
in
biology
marks
the
youth
and
imperfection
of
the
science
for
what
is
the
history
of
every
science
but
the
history
of
the
elimination
of
the
notion
of
creative
or
other
interferences
with
the
natural
order
of
the
ph√¶nomena
which
are
the
of
that
science
when
astronomy
was
young
the
morning
stars
sang
together
for
joy
and
the
planets
were
guided
in
their
courses
by
celestial
hands
now
the
harmony
of
the
stars
has
resolved
itself
into
gravitation
according
to
the
inverse
squares
of
the
distances
and
the
orbits
of
the
planets
are
deducible
from
the
laws
of
the
forces
which
allow
a
schoolboy
stone
to
break
a
window
the
lightning
was
the
angel
of
the
lord
but
it
has
pleased
providence
in
these
modern
times
that
science
should
make
it
the
humble
messenger
of
man
and
we
know
that
every
flash
that
shimmers
about
the
horizon
on
a
summer
evening
is
determined
by
ascertainable
conditions
and
that
its
direction
and
brightness
might
if
our
knowledge
of
these
were
great
enough
have
been
calculated
the
solvency
of
great
mercantile
companies
rests
on
the
validity
of
the
laws
which
have
been
ascertained
to
govern
the
seeming
irregularity
of
that
human
life
which
the
moralist
bewails
as
the
most
uncertain
of
things
plague
pestilence
and
famine
are
admitted
by
all
but
fools
to
be
the
natural
result
of
causes
for
the
most
part
fully
within
human
control
and
not
the
unavoidable
tortures
inflicted
by
wrathful
omnipotence
upon
his
helpless
handiwork
harmonious
order
governing
eternally
continuous
progress
the
web
and
woof
of
matter
and
force
interweaving
by
slow
degrees
without
a
broken
thread
that
veil
which
lies
between
us
and
the
infinite
that
universe
which
alone
we
know
or
can
know
such
is
the
picture
which
science
draws
of
the
world
and
in
proportion
as
any
part
of
that
picture
is
in
unison
with
the
rest
so
may
we
feel
sure
that
it
is
rightly
painted
shall
biology
alone
remain
out
of
harmony
with
her
sister
sciences
such
arguments
against
the
hypothesis
of
the
direct
creation
of
species
as
these
are
plainly
enough
deducible
from
general
considerations
but
there
are
in
addition
ph√¶nomena
exhibited
by
species
themselves
and
yet
not
so
much
a
part
of
their
very
essence
as
to
have
required
earlier
mention
which
are
in
the
highest
degree
perplexing
if
we
adopt
the
popularly
accepted
hypothesis
such
are
the
facts
of
distribution
in
space
and
in
time
the
singular
ph√¶nomena
brought
to
light
by
the
study
of
development
the
structural
relations
of
species
upon
which
our
systems
of
classification
are
founded
the
great
doctrines
of
philosophical
anatomy
such
as
that
of
homology
or
of
the
community
of
structural
plan
exhibited
by
large
groups
of
species
differing
very
widely
in
their
habits
and
functions
the
species
of
animals
which
inhabit
the
sea
on
opposite
sides
of
the
isthmus
of
panama
are
wholly
distinct
the
animals
and
plants
which
inhabit
islands
are
commonly
distinct
from
those
of
the
neighbouring
mainlands
and
yet
have
a
similarity
of
aspect
the
mammals
of
the
latest
tertiary
epoch
in
the
old
and
new
worlds
belong
to
the
same
genera
or
family
groups
as
those
which
now
inhabit
the
same
great
geographical
area
the
crocodilian
reptiles
which
existed
in
the
earliest
secondary
epoch
were
similar
in
general
structure
to
those
now
living
but
exhibit
slight
differences
in
their
vertebr√¶
nasal
passages
and
one
or
two
other
points
the
has
teeth
which
are
shed
before
it
is
born
and
hence
can
never
subserve
the
masticatory
purpose
for
which
they
seem
contrived
and
in
like
manner
the
female
dugong
has
tusks
which
never
cut
the
gum
all
the
members
of
the
same
great
group
run
through
similar
conditions
in
their
development
and
all
their
parts
in
the
adult
state
are
arranged
according
to
the
same
plan
man
is
more
like
a
gorilla
than
a
gorilla
is
like
a
lemur
such
are
a
few
taken
at
random
among
the
multitudes
of
similar
facts
which
modern
research
has
established
but
when
the
student
seeks
for
an
explanation
of
them
from
the
supporters
of
the
received
hypothesis
of
the
origin
of
species
the
reply
he
receives
is
in
substance
of
oriental
simplicity
and
brevity
mashallah
it
so
pleases
god
there
are
different
species
on
opposite
sides
of
the
isthmus
of
panama
because
they
were
created
different
on
the
two
sides
the
pliocene
mammals
are
like
the
existing
ones
because
such
was
the
plan
of
creation
and
we
find
rudimental
organs
and
similarity
of
plan
because
it
has
pleased
the
creator
to
set
before
himself
a
divine
exemplar
or
archetype
and
to
copy
it
in
his
works
and
somewhat
ill
those
who
hold
this
view
imply
in
some
of
them
that
such
verbal
should
be
received
as
science
will
one
day
be
regarded
as
evidence
of
the
low
state
of
intelligence
in
the
nineteenth
century
just
as
we
amuse
ourselves
with
the
phraseology
about
nature
abhorrence
of
a
vacuum
wherewith
torricelli
compatriots
were
satisfied
to
explain
the
rise
of
water
in
a
pump
and
be
it
recollected
that
this
sort
of
satisfaction
works
not
only
negative
but
positive
ill
by
discouraging
inquiry
and
so
depriving
man
of
the
usufruct
of
one
of
the
most
fertile
fields
of
his
great
patrimony
nature
the
objections
to
the
doctrine
of
the
origin
of
species
by
special
creation
which
have
been
detailed
must
have
occurred
with
more
or
less
force
to
the
mind
of
every
one
who
has
seriously
and
independently
considered
the
subject
it
is
therefore
no
wonder
that
from
time
to
time
this
hypothesis
should
have
been
met
by
counter
hypotheses
all
as
well
and
some
better
founded
than
itself
and
it
is
curious
to
remark
that
the
inventors
of
the
opposing
views
seem
to
have
been
led
into
them
as
much
by
their
knowledge
of
geology
as
by
their
acquaintance
with
biology
in
fact
when
the
mind
has
once
admitted
the
conception
of
the
gradual
production
of
the
present
physical
state
of
our
globe
by
natural
causes
operating
through
long
ages
of
time
it
will
be
little
disposed
to
allow
that
living
beings
have
made
their
appearance
in
another
way
and
the
speculations
of
de
maillet
and
his
successors
are
the
natural
complement
of
scilla
demonstration
of
the
true
nature
of
fossils
a
contemporary
of
newton
and
of
leibnitz
sharing
therefore
in
the
intellectual
activity
of
the
remarkable
age
which
witnessed
the
birth
of
modern
physical
science
beno√Æt
de
maillet
spent
a
long
life
as
a
consular
agent
of
the
french
government
in
various
mediterranean
ports
for
sixteen
years
in
fact
he
held
the
office
of
in
egypt
and
the
wonderful
ph√¶nomena
offered
by
the
valley
of
the
nile
appear
to
have
strongly
impressed
his
mind
to
have
directed
his
attention
to
all
facts
of
a
similar
order
which
came
within
his
observation
and
to
have
led
him
to
speculate
on
the
origin
of
the
present
condition
of
our
globe
and
of
its
inhabitants
but
with
all
his
ardour
for
science
de
maillet
seems
to
have
hesitated
to
publish
views
which
notwithstanding
the
ingenious
attempts
to
reconcile
them
with
the
hebrew
hypothesis
contained
in
the
preface
to
telliamed
were
hardly
likely
to
be
received
with
favour
by
his
contemporaries
but
a
short
time
had
elapsed
since
more
than
one
of
the
great
anatomists
and
physicists
of
the
italian
school
had
paid
dearly
for
their
endeavours
to
dissipate
some
of
the
prevalent
errors
and
their
illustrious
pupil
harvey
the
founder
of
modern
physiology
had
not
fared
so
well
in
a
country
less
oppressed
by
the
benumbing
influences
of
theology
as
to
tempt
any
man
to
follow
his
example
probably
not
uninfluenced
by
these
considerations
his
catholic
for
egypt
kept
his
theories
to
himself
throughout
a
long
life
for
telliamed
the
only
scientific
work
which
is
known
to
have
proceeded
from
his
pen
was
not
printed
till
when
its
author
had
reached
the
ripe
age
of
and
though
de
maillet
lived
three
years
longer
his
book
was
not
given
to
the
world
before
even
then
it
was
anonymous
to
those
who
were
not
in
the
secret
of
the
anagramatic
character
of
its
title
and
the
preface
and
dedication
are
so
worded
as
in
case
of
necessity
to
give
the
printer
a
fair
chance
of
falling
back
on
the
excuse
that
the
work
was
intended
for
a
mere
the
speculations
of
the
supposititious
indian
sage
though
quite
as
sound
as
those
of
many
a
mosaic
geology
which
sells
exceedingly
well
have
no
great
value
if
we
consider
them
by
the
light
of
modern
science
the
waters
are
supposed
to
have
originally
covered
the
whole
globe
to
have
deposited
the
rocky
masses
which
compose
its
mountains
by
processes
comparable
to
those
which
are
now
forming
mud
sand
and
shingle
and
then
to
have
gradually
lowered
their
level
leaving
the
spoils
of
their
animal
and
vegetable
inhabitants
embedded
in
the
strata
as
the
dry
land
appeared
certain
of
the
aquatic
animals
are
supposed
to
have
taken
to
it
and
to
have
become
gradually
adapted
to
terrestrial
and
a√´rial
modes
of
existence
but
if
we
regard
the
general
tenor
and
style
of
the
reasoning
in
relation
to
the
state
of
knowledge
of
the
day
two
circumstances
appear
very
well
worthy
of
remark
the
first
that
de
maillet
had
a
notion
of
the
modifiability
of
living
forms
though
without
any
precise
information
on
the
subject
and
how
such
modifiability
might
account
for
the
origin
of
species
the
second
that
he
very
clearly
apprehended
the
great
modern
geological
doctrine
so
strongly
insisted
upon
by
hutton
and
so
ably
and
comprehensively
expounded
by
lyell
that
we
must
look
to
existing
causes
for
the
explanation
of
past
geological
events
indeed
the
following
passage
of
the
preface
in
which
de
maillet
is
supposed
to
speak
of
the
indian
philosopher
telliamed
his
might
have
been
written
by
the
most
philosophical
uniformitarian
of
the
present
day

speculations
are
rather
behind
than
in
advance
of
those
of
de
maillet
and
though
linn√¶us
may
have
played
with
the
hypothesis
of
transmutation
it
obtained
no
serious
support
until
lamarck
adopted
it
and
advocated
it
with
great
ability
in
his
philosophie
zoologique
impelled
towards
the
hypothesis
of
the
transmutation
of
species
partly
by
his
general
cosmological
and
geological
views
partly
by
the
conception
of
a
graduated
though
irregularly
branching
scale
of
being
which
had
arisen
out
of
his
profound
study
of
plants
and
of
the
lower
forms
of
animal
life
lamarck
whose
general
line
of
thought
often
closely
resembles
that
of
de
maillet
made
a
great
advance
upon
the
crude
and
merely
speculative
manner
in
which
that
writer
deals
with
the
question
of
the
origin
of
living
beings
by
endeavouring
to
find
physical
causes
competent
to
effect
that
change
of
one
species
into
another
which
de
maillet
had
only
supposed
to
occur
and
lamarck
conceived
that
he
had
found
in
nature
such
causes
amply
sufficient
for
the
purpose
in
view
it
is
a
physiological
fact
he
says
that
organs
are
increased
in
size
by
action
atrophied
by
inaction
it
is
another
physiological
fact
that
modifications
produced
are
transmissible
to
offspring
change
the
actions
of
an
animal
therefore
and
you
will
change
its
structure
by
increasing
the
development
of
the
parts
newly
brought
into
use
and
by
the
diminution
of
those
less
used
but
by
altering
the
circumstances
which
surround
it
you
will
alter
its
actions
and
hence
in
the
long
run
change
of
circumstance
must
produce
change
of
organization
all
the
species
of
animals
therefore
are
in
lamarck
view
the
result
of
the
indirect
action
of
changes
of
circumstance
upon
those
primitive
germs
which
he
considered
to
have
originally
arisen
by
spontaneous
generation
within
the
waters
of
the
globe
it
is
curious
however
that
lamarck
should
insist
so
strongly
as
he
has
done
that
circumstances
never
in
any
degree
directly
modify
the
form
or
the
organization
of
animals
but
only
operate
by
changing
their
wants
and
consequently
their
actions
for
he
thereby
brings
upon
himself
the
obvious
question
how
then
do
plants
which
can
not
be
said
to
have
wants
or
actions
become
modified
to
this
he
replies
that
they
are
modified
by
the
changes
in
their
nutritive
processes
which
are
effected
by
changing
circumstances
and
it
does
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
him
that
such
changes
might
be
as
well
supposed
to
take
place
among
animals
when
we
have
said
that
lamarck
felt
that
mere
speculation
was
not
the
way
to
arrive
at
the
origin
of
species
but
that
it
was
necessary
in
order
to
the
establishment
of
any
sound
theory
on
the
subject
to
discover
by
observation
or
otherwise
some
competent
to
give
rise
to
them
that
he
affirmed
the
true
order
of
classification
to
coincide
with
the
order
of
their
development
one
from
another
that
he
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
allowing
sufficient
time
very
strongly
and
that
all
the
varieties
of
instinct
and
reason
were
traced
back
by
him
to
the
same
cause
as
that
which
has
given
rise
to
species
we
have
enumerated
his
chief
contributions
to
the
advance
of
the
question
on
the
other
hand
from
his
ignorance
of
any
power
in
nature
competent
to
modify
the
structure
of
animals
except
the
development
of
parts
or
atrophy
of
them
in
consequence
of
a
change
of
needs
lamarck
was
led
to
attach
infinitely
greater
weight
than
it
deserves
to
this
agency
and
the
absurdities
into
which
he
was
led
have
met
with
deserved
condemnation
of
the
struggle
for
existence
on
which
as
we
shall
see
darwin
lays
such
great
stress
he
had
no
conception
indeed
he
doubts
whether
there
really
are
such
things
as
extinct
species
unless
they
be
such
large
animals
as
may
have
met
their
death
at
the
hands
of
man
and
so
little
does
he
dream
of
there
being
any
other
destructive
causes
at
work
that
in
discussing
the
possible
existence
of
fossil
shells
he
asks
pourquoi

phil
vol
p
of
the
influence
of
selection
lamarck
has
as
little
notion
and
he
makes
no
use
of
the
wonderful
ph√¶nomena
which
are
exhibited
by
domesticated
animals
and
illustrate
its
powers
the
vast
influence
of
cuvier
was
employed
against
the
lamarckian
views
and
as
the
untenability
of
some
of
his
conclusions
was
easily
shown
his
doctrines
sank
under
the
opprobium
of
scientific
as
well
as
of
theological
heterodoxy
nor
have
the
efforts
made
of
late
years
to
revive
them
tended
to
their
credit
in
the
minds
of
sound
thinkers
acquainted
with
the
facts
of
the
case
indeed
it
may
be
doubted
whether
lamarck
has
not
suffered
more
from
his
friends
than
from
his
foes
two
years
ago
in
fact
though
we
venture
to
question
if
even
the
strongest
supporters
of
the
special
creation
hypothesis
had
not
now
and
then
an
uneasy
consciousness
that
all
was
not
right
their
position
seemed
more
impregnable
than
ever
if
not
by
its
own
inherent
strength
at
any
rate
by
the
obvious
failure
of
all
the
attempts
which
had
been
made
to
carry
it
on
the
other
hand
however
much
the
few
who
thought
deeply
on
the
question
of
species
might
be
repelled
by
the
generally
received
dogmas
they
saw
no
way
of
escaping
from
them
save
by
the
adoption
of
suppositions
so
little
justified
by
experiment
or
by
observation
as
to
be
at
least
equally
distasteful
the
choice
lay
between
two
absurdities
and
a
middle
condition
of
uneasy
scepticism
which
last
however
unpleasant
and
unsatisfactory
was
obviously
the
only
justifiable
state
of
mind
under
the
circumstances
such
being
the
general
ferment
in
the
minds
of
naturalists
it
is
no
wonder
that
they
mustered
strong
in
the
rooms
of
the
linn√¶an
society
on
the
of
july
of
the
year
to
hear
two
papers
by
authors
living
on
opposite
sides
of
the
globe
working
out
their
results
independently
and
yet
professing
to
have
discovered
one
and
the
same
solution
of
all
the
problems
connected
with
species
the
one
of
these
authors
was
an
able
naturalist
wallace
who
had
been
employed
for
some
years
in
studying
the
productions
of
the
islands
of
the
indian
archipelago
and
who
had
forwarded
a
memoir
embodying
his
views
to
darwin
for
communication
to
the
linn√¶an
society
on
perusing
the
essay
darwin
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
that
it
embodied
some
of
the
leading
ideas
of
a
great
work
which
he
had
been
preparing
for
twenty
years
and
parts
of
which
containing
a
development
of
the
very
same
views
had
been
perused
by
his
private
friends
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
before
perplexed
in
what
manner
to
do
full
justice
both
to
his
friend
and
to
himself
darwin
placed
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
hooker
and
sir
charles
lyell
by
whose
advice
he
communicated
a
brief
abstract
of
his
own
views
to
the
linn√¶an
society
at
the
same
time
that
paper
was
read
of
that
abstract
the
work
on
the
origin
of
species
is
an
enlargement
but
a
complete
statement
of
darwin
doctrine
is
looked
for
in
the
large
and
work
which
he
is
said
to
be
preparing
for
publication
the
darwinian
hypothesis
has
the
merit
of
being
eminently
simple
and
comprehensible
in
principle
and
its
essential
positions
may
be
stated
in
a
very
few
words
all
species
have
been
produced
by
the
development
of
varieties
from
common
stocks
by
the
conversion
of
these
first
into
permanent
races
and
then
into
new
species
by
the
process
of
which
process
is
essentially
identical
with
that
artificial
selection
by
which
man
has
originated
the
races
of
domestic
animals
the
for
taking
the
place
of
man
and
exerting
in
the
case
of
natural
selection
that
selective
action
which
he
performs
in
artificial
selection
the
evidence
brought
forward
by
darwin
in
support
of
his
hypothesis
is
of
three
kinds
first
he
endeavours
to
prove
that
species
may
be
originated
by
selection
secondly
he
attempts
to
show
that
natural
causes
are
competent
to
exert
selection
and
thirdly
he
tries
to
prove
that
the
most
remarkable
and
apparently
anomalous
ph√¶nomena
exhibited
by
the
distribution
development
and
mutual
relations
of
species
can
be
shown
to
be
deducible
from
the
general
doctrine
of
their
origin
which
he
propounds
combined
with
the
known
facts
of
geological
change
and
that
even
if
all
these
ph√¶nomena
are
not
at
present
explicable
by
it
none
are
necessarily
inconsistent
with
it
there
can
not
be
a
doubt
that
the
method
of
inquiry
which
darwin
has
adopted
is
not
only
rigorously
in
accordance
with
the
canons
of
scientific
logic
but
that
it
is
the
only
adequate
method
critics
exclusively
trained
in
classics
or
in
mathematics
who
have
never
determined
a
scientific
fact
in
their
lives
by
induction
from
experiment
or
observation
prate
learnedly
about
darwin
method
which
is
not
inductive
enough
not
baconian
enough
forsooth
for
them
but
even
if
practical
acquaintance
with
the
process
of
scientific
investigation
is
denied
them
they
may
learn
by
the
perusal
of
mill
admirable
chapter
on
the
deductive
method
that
there
are
multitudes
of
scientific
inquiries
in
which
the
method
of
pure
induction
helps
the
investigator
but
a
very
little
way
the
mode
of
investigation
says
mill
which
from
the
proved
inapplicability
of
direct
methods
of
observation
and
experiment
remains
to
us
as
the
main
source
of
the
knowledge
we
possess
or
can
acquire
respecting
the
conditions
and
laws
of
recurrence
of
the
more
complex
ph√¶nomena
is
called
in
its
most
general
expression
the
deductive
method
and
consists
of
three
operations
the
first
one
of
direct
induction
the
second
of
ratiocination
and
the
third
of
verification
now
the
conditions
which
have
determined
the
existence
of
species
are
not
only
exceedingly
complex
but
so
far
as
the
great
majority
of
them
are
concerned
are
necessarily
beyond
our
cognizance
but
what
darwin
has
attempted
to
do
is
in
exact
accordance
with
the
rule
laid
down
by
mill
he
has
endeavoured
to
determine
certain
great
facts
inductively
by
observation
and
experiment
he
has
then
reasoned
from
the
data
thus
furnished
and
lastly
he
has
tested
the
validity
of
his
ratiocination
by
comparing
his
deductions
with
the
observed
facts
of
nature
inductively
darwin
endeavours
to
prove
that
species
arise
in
a
given
way
deductively
he
desires
to
show
that
if
they
arise
in
that
way
the
facts
of
distribution
development
classification
may
be
accounted
for
may
be
deduced
from
their
mode
of
origin
combined
with
admitted
changes
in
physical
geography
and
climate
during
an
indefinite
period
and
this
explanation
or
coincidence
of
observed
with
deduced
facts
is
so
far
as
it
extends
a
verification
of
the
darwinian
view
there
is
no
fault
to
be
found
with
darwin
method
then
but
it
is
another
question
whether
he
has
fulfilled
all
the
conditions
imposed
by
that
method
is
it
satisfactorily
proved
in
fact
that
species
may
be
originated
by
selection
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
natural
selection
that
none
of
the
ph√¶nomena
exhibited
by
species
are
inconsistent
with
the
origin
of
species
in
this
way
if
these
questions
can
be
answered
in
the
affirmative
darwin
view
steps
out
of
the
ranks
of
hypotheses
into
those
of
proved
theories
but
so
long
as
the
evidence
at
present
adduced
falls
short
of
enforcing
that
affirmation
so
long
to
our
minds
must
the
new
doctrine
be
content
to
remain
among
the
former
an
extremely
valuable
and
in
the
highest
degree
probable
doctrine
indeed
the
only
extant
hypothesis
which
is
worth
anything
in
a
scientific
point
of
view
but
still
a
hypothesis
and
not
yet
the
theory
of
species
after
much
consideration
and
with
assuredly
no
bias
against
darwin
views
it
is
our
clear
conviction
that
as
the
evidence
stands
it
is
not
absolutely
proven
that
a
group
of
animals
having
all
the
characters
exhibited
by
species
in
nature
has
ever
been
originated
by
selection
whether
artificial
or
natural
groups
having
the
morphological
character
of
species
distinct
and
permanent
races
in
fact
have
been
so
produced
over
and
over
again
but
there
is
no
positive
evidence
at
present
that
any
group
of
animals
has
by
variation
and
selective
breeding
given
rise
to
another
group
which
was
even
in
the
least
degree
infertile
with
the
first
darwin
is
perfectly
aware
of
this
weak
point
and
brings
forward
a
multitude
of
ingenious
and
important
arguments
to
diminish
the
force
of
the
objection
we
admit
the
value
of
these
arguments
to
their
fullest
extent
nay
we
will
go
so
far
as
to
express
our
belief
that
experiments
conducted
by
a
skilful
physiologist
would
very
probably
obtain
the
desired
production
of
mutually
more
or
less
infertile
breeds
from
a
common
stock
in
a
comparatively
few
years
but
still
as
the
case
stands
at
present
this
little
rift
within
the
lute
is
not
to
be
disguised
nor
overlooked
in
the
remainder
of
darwin
argument
our
own
private
ingenuity
has
not
hitherto
enabled
us
to
pick
holes
of
any
great
importance
and
judging
by
what
we
hear
and
read
other
adventurers
in
the
same
field
do
not
seem
to
have
been
much
more
fortunate
it
has
been
urged
for
instance
that
in
his
chapters
on
the
struggle
for
existence
and
on
natural
selection
darwin
does
not
so
much
prove
that
natural
selection
does
occur
as
that
it
must
occur
but
in
fact
no
other
sort
of
demonstration
is
attainable
a
race
does
not
attract
our
attention
in
nature
until
it
has
in
all
probability
existed
for
a
considerable
time
and
then
it
is
too
late
to
inquire
into
the
conditions
of
its
origin
again
it
is
said
that
there
is
no
real
analogy
between
the
selection
which
takes
place
under
domestication
by
human
influence
and
any
operation
which
can
be
effected
by
nature
for
man
interferes
intelligently
reduced
to
its
elements
this
argument
implies
that
an
effect
produced
with
trouble
by
an
intelligent
agent
must
be
more
troublesome
if
not
impossible
to
an
unintelligent
agent
even
putting
aside
the
question
whether
nature
acting
as
she
does
according
to
definite
and
invariable
laws
can
be
rightly
called
an
unintelligent
agent
such
a
position
as
this
is
wholly
untenable
mix
salt
and
sand
and
it
shall
puzzle
the
wisest
of
men
with
his
mere
natural
appliances
to
separate
all
the
grains
of
sand
from
all
the
grains
of
salt
but
a
shower
of
rain
will
effect
the
same
object
in
ten
minutes
and
so
while
man
may
find
it
tax
all
his
intelligence
to
separate
any
variety
which
arises
and
to
breed
selectively
from
it
the
destructive
agencies
incessantly
at
work
in
nature
if
they
find
one
variety
to
be
more
soluble
in
circumstances
than
the
other
will
inevitably
in
the
long
run
eliminate
it
a
frequent
and
a
just
objection
to
the
lamarckian
hypothesis
of
the
transmutation
of
species
is
based
upon
the
absence
of
transitional
forms
between
many
species
but
against
the
darwinian
hypothesis
this
argument
has
no
force
indeed
one
of
the
most
valuable
and
suggestive
parts
of
darwin
work
is
that
in
which
he
proves
that
the
frequent
absence
of
transitions
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
his
doctrine
and
that
the
stock
whence
two
or
more
species
have
sprung
need
in
no
respect
be
intermediate
between
these
species
if
any
two
species
have
arisen
from
a
common
stock
in
the
same
way
as
the
carrier
and
the
pouter
say
have
arisen
from
the
then
the
common
stock
of
these
two
species
need
be
no
more
intermediate
between
the
two
than
the
is
between
the
carrier
and
pouter
clearly
appreciate
the
force
of
this
analogy
and
all
the
arguments
against
the
origin
of
species
by
selection
based
on
the
absence
of
transitional
forms
fall
to
the
ground
and
darwin
position
might
we
think
have
been
even
stronger
than
it
is
if
he
had
not
embarrassed
himself
with
the
aphorism
non
facit
which
turns
up
so
often
in
his
pages
we
believe
as
we
have
said
above
that
nature
does
make
jumps
now
and
then
and
a
recognition
of
the
fact
is
of
no
small
importance
in
disposing
of
many
minor
objections
to
the
doctrine
of
transmutation
but
we
must
pause
the
discussion
of
darwin
arguments
in
detail
would
lead
us
far
beyond
the
limits
within
which
we
proposed
at
starting
to
confine
this
article
our
object
has
been
attained
if
we
have
given
an
intelligible
however
brief
account
of
the
established
facts
connected
with
species
and
of
the
relation
of
the
explanation
of
those
facts
offered
by
darwin
to
the
theoretical
views
held
by
his
predecessors
and
his
contemporaries
and
above
all
to
the
requirements
of
scientific
logic
we
have
ventured
to
point
out
that
it
does
not
as
yet
satisfy
all
those
requirements
but
we
do
not
hesitate
to
assert
that
it
is
as
superior
to
any
preceding
or
contemporary
hypothesis
in
the
extent
of
observational
and
experimental
basis
on
which
it
rests
in
its
rigorously
scientific
method
and
in
its
power
of
explaining
biological
ph√¶nomena
as
was
the
hypothesis
of
copernicus
to
the
speculations
of
ptolemy
but
the
planetary
orbits
turned
out
to
be
not
quite
circular
after
all
and
grand
as
was
the
service
copernicus
rendered
to
science
kepler
and
newton
had
to
come
after
him
what
if
the
orbit
of
darwinism
should
be
a
little
too
circular
what
if
species
should
offer
residual
ph√¶nomena
here
and
there
not
explicable
by
natural
selection
twenty
years
hence
naturalists
may
be
in
a
position
to
say
whether
this
is
or
is
not
the
case
but
in
either
event
they
will
owe
the
author
of
the
origin
of
species
an
immense
debt
of
gratitude
we
should
leave
a
very
wrong
impression
on
the
reader
mind
if
we
permitted
him
to
suppose
that
the
value
of
that
work
depends
wholly
on
the
ultimate
justification
of
the
theoretical
views
which
it
contains
on
the
contrary
if
they
were
disproved
the
book
would
still
be
the
best
of
its
kind
the
most
compendious
statement
of

in
the
course
of
the
present

several
foreign
commentaries
upon
darwin
great
work
have
made
their
appearance
those
who
have
perused
that
remarkable
chapter
of
the
antiquity
of
man
in
which
sir
charles
lyell
draws
a
parallel
between
the
development
of
species
and
that
of
languages
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
one
of
the
most
eminent
philologers
of
germany
professor
schleicher
has
independently
published
a
most
instructive
and
philosophical
pamphlet
an
excellent
notice
of
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
for
february
of
this
year
supporting
similar
views
with
all
the
weight
of
his
special
knowledge
and
established
authority
as
a
linguist
professor
haeckel
to
whom
schleicher
addresses
himself
previously
took
occasion
in
his
splendid
monograph
on
the
to
express
his
high
appreciation
of
and
general
concordance
with
darwin
views
but
the
most
elaborate
criticisms
of
the
origin
of
species
which
have
appeared
are
two
works
of
very
widely
different
merit
the
one
by
professor
k√∂lliker
the
anatomist
and
histologist
of
w√ºrzburg
the
other
by
flourens
perpetual
secretary
of
the
french
academy
of

professor
k√∂lliker
critical
essay
upon
the
darwinian
theory
is
like
all
that
proceeds
from
the
pen
of
that
thoughtful
and
accomplished
writer
worthy
of
the
most
careful
consideration
it
comprises
a
brief
but
clear
sketch
of
darwin
views
followed
by
an
enumeration
of
the
leading
difficulties
in
the
way
of
their
acceptance
difficulties
which
would
appear
to
be
insurmountable
to
professor
k√∂lliker
inasmuch
as
he
proposes
to
replace
darwin
theory
by
one
which
he
terms
the
theory
of
heterogeneous
generation
we
shall
proceed
to
consider
first
the
destructive
and
secondly
the
constructive
portion
of
the
essay
we
regret
to
find
ourselves
compelled
to
dissent
very
widely
from
many
of
professor
k√∂lliker
remarks
and
from
none
more
thoroughly
than
from
those
in
which
he
seeks
to
define
what
we
may
term
the
philosophical
position
of
darwinism
darwin
says
professor
k√∂lliker
is
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
a
teleologist
he
says
quite
distinctly
first
edition
pp
that
every
particular
in
the
structure
of
an
animal
has
been
created
for
its
benefit
and
he
regards
the
whole
series
of
animal
forms
only
from
this
point
of
view
and
again
the
teleological
general
conception
adopted
by
darwin
is
a
mistaken
one
varieties
arise
irrespectively
of
the
notion
of
purpose
or
of
utility
according
to
general
laws
of
nature
and
may
be
either
useful
or
hurtful
or
indifferent
the
assumption
that
an
organism
exists
only
on
account
of
some
definite
end
in
view
and
represents
something
more
than
the
incorporation
of
a
general
idea
or
law
implies
a
conception
of
the
universe
assuredly
every
organ
has
and
every
organism
fulfils
its
end
but
its
purpose
is
not
the
condition
of
its
existence
every
organism
is
also
sufficiently
perfect
for
the
purpose
it
serves
and
in
that
at
least
it
is
useless
to
seek
for
a
cause
of
its
improvement
it
is
singular
how
differently
one
and
the
same
book
will
impress
different
minds
that
which
struck
the
present
writer
most
forcibly
on
his
first
perusal
of
the
origin
of
species
was
the
conviction
that
teleology
as
commonly
understood
had
received
its
deathblow
at
darwin
hands
for
the
teleological
argument
runs
thus
an
organ
or
organism
a
is
precisely
fitted
to
perform
a
function
or
purpose
b
therefore
it
was
specially
constructed
to
perform
that
function
in
paley
famous
illustration
the
adaptation
of
all
the
parts
of
the
watch
to
the
function
or
purpose
of
showing
the
time
is
held
to
be
evidence
that
the
watch
was
specially
contrived
to
that
end
on
the
ground
that
the
only
cause
we
know
of
competent
to
produce
such
an
effect
as
a
watch
which
shall
keep
time
is
a
contriving
intelligence
adapting
the
means
directly
to
that
end
suppose
however
that
any
one
had
been
able
to
show
that
the
watch
had
not
been
made
directly
by
any
person
but
that
it
was
the
result
of
the
modification
of
another
watch
which
kept
time
but
poorly
and
that
this
again
had
proceeded
from
a
structure
which
could
hardly
be
called
a
watch
at
all
seeing
that
it
had
no
figures
on
the
dial
and
the
hands
were
rudimentary
and
that
going
back
and
back
in
time
we
came
at
last
to
a
revolving
barrel
as
the
earliest
traceable
rudiment
of
the
whole
fabric
and
imagine
that
it
had
been
possible
to
show
that
all
these
changes
had
resulted
first
from
a
tendency
of
the
structure
to
vary
indefinitely
and
secondly
from
something
in
the
surrounding
world
which
helped
all
variations
in
the
direction
of
an
accurate
and
checked
all
those
in
other
directions
then
it
is
obvious
that
the
force
of
paley
argument
would
be
gone
for
it
would
be
demonstrated
that
an
apparatus
thoroughly
well
adapted
to
a
particular
purpose
might
be
the
result
of
a
method
of
trial
and
error
worked
by
unintelligent
agents
as
well
as
of
the
direct
application
of
the
means
appropriate
to
that
end
by
an
intelligent
agent
now
it
appears
to
us
that
what
we
have
here
for
illustration
sake
supposed
to
be
done
with
the
watch
is
exactly
what
the
establishment
of
darwin
theory
will
do
for
the
organic
world
for
the
notion
that
every
organism
has
been
created
as
it
is
and
launched
straight
at
a
purpose
darwin
substitutes
the
conception
of
something
which
may
fairly
be
termed
a
method
of
trial
and
error
organisms
vary
incessantly
of
these
variations
the
few
meet
with
surrounding
conditions
which
suit
them
and
thrive
the
many
are
unsuited
and
become
extinguished
according
to
teleology
each
organism
is
like
a
rifle
bullet
fired
straight
at
a
mark
according
to
darwin
organisms
are
like
grapeshot
of
which
one
hits
something
and
the
rest
fall
wide
for
the
teleologist
an
organism
exists
because
it
was
made
for
the
conditions
in
which
it
is
found
for
the
darwinian
an
organism
exists
because
out
of
many
of
its
kind
it
is
the
only
one
which
has
been
able
to
persist
in
the
conditions
in
which
it
is
found
teleology
implies
that
the
organs
of
every
organism
are
perfect
and
can
not
be
improved
the
darwinian
theory
simply
affirms
that
they
work
well
enough
to
enable
the
organism
to
hold
its
own
against
such
competitors
as
it
has
met
with
but
admits
the
possibility
of
indefinite
improvement
but
an
example
may
bring
into
clearer
light
the
profound
opposition
between
the
ordinary
teleological
and
the
darwinian
conception
cats
catch
mice
small
birds
and
the
like
very
well
teleology
tells
us
that
they
do
so
because
they
were
expressly
constructed
for
so
doing
that
they
are
perfect
mousing
apparatuses
so
perfect
and
so
delicately
adjusted
that
no
one
of
their
organs
could
be
altered
without
the
change
involving
the
alteration
of
all
the
rest
darwinism
affirms
on
the
contrary
that
there
was
no
express
construction
concerned
in
the
matter
but
that
among
the
multitudinous
variations
of
the
feline
stock
many
of
which
died
out
from
want
of
power
to
resist
opposing
influences
some
the
cats
were
better
fitted
to
catch
mice
than
others
whence
they
throve
and
persisted
in
proportion
to
the
advantage
over
their
fellows
thus
offered
to
them
far
from
imagining
that
cats
exist
to
catch
mice
well
darwinism
supposes
that
cats
exist
they
catch
mice
well
mousing
being
not
the
end
but
the
condition
of
their
existence
and
if
the
has
long
persisted
as
we
know
it
the
interpretation
of
the
fact
upon
darwinian
principles
would
be
not
that
the
cats
have
remained
invariable
but
that
such
varieties
as
have
incessantly
occurred
have
been
on
the
whole
less
fitted
to
get
on
in
the
world
than
the
existing
stock
if
we
apprehend
the
spirit
of
the
origin
of
species
rightly
then
nothing
can
be
more
entirely
and
absolutely
opposed
to
teleology
as
it
is
commonly
understood
than
the
darwinian
theory
so
far
from
being
a
teleologist
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
we
should
deny
that
he
is
a
teleologist
in
the
ordinary
sense
at
all
and
we
should
say
that
apart
from
his
merits
as
a
naturalist
he
has
rendered
a
most
remarkable
service
to
philosophical
thought
by
enabling
the
student
of
nature
to
recognise
to
their
fullest
extent
those
adaptations
to
purpose
which
are
so
striking
in
the
organic
world
and
which
teleology
has
done
good
service
in
keeping
before
our
minds
without
being
false
to
the
fundamental
principles
of
a
scientific
conception
of
the
universe
the
apparently
diverging
teachings
of
the
teleologist
and
of
the
morphologist
are
reconciled
by
the
darwinian
hypothesis
but
leaving
our
own
impressions
of
the
origin
of
species
and
turning
to
those
passages
specially
cited
by
professor
k√∂lliker
we
can
not
admit
that
they
bear
the
interpretation
he
puts
upon
them
darwin
if
we
read
him
rightly
does
affirm
that
every
detail
in
the
structure
of
an
animal
has
been
created
for
its
benefit
his
words
are
the
foregoing
remarks
lead
me
to
say
a
few
words
on
the
protest
lately
made
by
some
naturalists
against
the
utilitarian
doctrine
that
every
detail
of
structure
has
been
produced
for
the
good
of
its
possessor
they
believe
that
very
many
structures
have
been
created
for
beauty
in
the
eyes
of
man
or
for
mere
variety
this
doctrine
if
true
would
be
absolutely
fatal
to
my
theory
yet
i
fully
admit
that
many
structures
are
of
no
direct
use
to
their
possessor
and
after
sundry
illustrations
and
qualifications
he
concludes
hence
every
detail
of
structure
in
every
living
creature
making
some
little
allowance
for
the
direct
action
of
physical
conditions
may
be
viewed
either
as
having
been
of
special
use
to
some
ancestral
form
or
as
being
now
of
special
use
to
the
descendants
of
this
form
either
directly
or
indirectly
through
the
complex
laws
of
growth
but
it
is
one
thing
to
say
darwinically
that
every
detail
observed
in
an
animal
structure
is
of
use
to
it
or
has
been
of
use
to
its
ancestors
and
quite
another
to
affirm
teleologically
that
every
detail
of
an
animal
structure
has
been
created
for
its
benefit
on
the
former
hypothesis
for
example
the
teeth
of
the
foetal
have
a
meaning
on
the
latter
none
so
far
as
we
are
aware
there
is
not
a
phrase
in
the
origin
of
species
inconsistent
with
professor
k√∂lliker
position
that
varieties
arise
irrespectively
of
the
notion
of
purpose
or
of
utility
according
to
general
laws
of
nature
and
may
be
either
useful
or
hurtful
or
indifferent
on
the
contrary
darwin
writes
summary
of
chap
our
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
variation
is
profound
not
in
one
case
out
of
a
hundred
can
we
pretend
to
assign
any
reason
why
this
or
that
part
varies
more
or
less
from
the
same
part
in
the
parents
the
external
conditions
of
life
as
climate
and
food
seem
to
have
induced
some
slight
modifications
habit
in
producing
constitutional
differences
and
use
in
strengthening
and
disuse
in
weakening
and
diminishing
organs
seem
to
have
been
more
potent
in
their
effects
and
finally
as
if
to
prevent
all
possible
misconception
darwin
concludes
his
chapter
on
variation
with
these
pregnant
words
whatever
the
cause
may
be
of
each
slight
difference
in
the
offspring
from
their
parents
and
a
cause
for
each
must
exist
it
is
the
steady
accumulation
through
natural
selection
of
such
differences
when
beneficial
to
the
individual
that
gives
rise
to
all
the
more
important
modifications
of
structure
by
which
the
innumerable
beings
on
the
face
of
the
earth
are
enabled
to
struggle
with
each
other
and
the
best
adapted
to
survive
we
have
dwelt
at
length
upon
this
subject
because
of
its
great
general
importance
and
because
we
believe
that
professor
k√∂lliker
criticisms
on
this
head
are
based
upon
a
misapprehension
of
views
substantially
they
appear
to
us
to
coincide
with
his
own
the
other
objections
which
professor
k√∂lliker
enumerates
and
discusses
are
the
following
no
transitional
forms
between
existing
species
are
known
and
known
varieties
whether
selected
or
spontaneous
never
go
so
far
as
to
establish
new
species
to
this
professor
k√∂lliker
appears
to
attach
some
weight
he
makes
the
suggestion
that
the
tumbler
pigeon
may
be
a
pathological
product
no
transitional
forms
of
animals
are
met
with
among
the
organic
remains
of
earlier
epochs
upon
this
professor
k√∂lliker
remarks
that
the
absence
of
transitional
forms
in
the
fossil
world
though
not
necessarily
fatal
to
views
weakens
his
case
the
struggle
for
existence
does
not
take
place
to
this
objection
urged
by
pelzeln
k√∂lliker
very
justly
attaches
no
weight
a
tendency
of
organisms
to
give
rise
to
useful
varieties
and
a
natural
selection
do
not
exist
the
varieties
which
are
found
arise
in
consequence
of
manifold
external
influences
and
it
is
not
obvious
why
they
all
or
partially
should
be
particularly
useful
each
animal
suffices
for
its
own
ends
is
perfect
of
its
kind
and
needs
no
further
development
should
however
a
variety
be
useful
and
even
maintain
itself
there
is
no
obvious
reason
why
it
should
change
any
further
the
whole
conception
of
the
imperfection
of
organisms
and
the
necessity
of
their
becoming
perfected
is
plainly
the
weakest
side
of
darwin
theory
and
a
nothbehelf
because
darwin
could
think
of
no
other
principle
by
which
to
explain
the
metamorphoses
which
as
i
also
believe
have
occurred
here
again
we
must
venture
to
dissent
completely
from
professor
k√∂lliker
conception
of
darwin
hypothesis
it
appears
to
us
to
be
one
of
the
many
peculiar
merits
of
that
hypothesis
that
it
involves
no
belief
in
a
necessary
and
continual
progress
of
organisms
again
darwin
if
we
read
him
aright
assumes
no
special
tendency
of
organisms
to
give
rise
to
useful
varieties
and
knows
nothing
of
needs
of
development
or
necessity
of
perfection
what
he
says
is
in
substance
all
organisms
vary
it
is
in
the
highest
degree
improbable
that
any
given
variety
should
have
exactly
the
same
relations
to
surrounding
conditions
as
the
parent
stock
in
that
case
it
is
either
better
fitted
when
the
variation
may
be
called
useful
or
worse
fitted
to
cope
with
them
if
better
it
will
tend
to
supplant
the
parent
stock
if
worse
it
will
tend
to
be
extinguished
by
the
parent
stock
if
as
is
hardly
conceivable
the
new
variety
is
so
perfectly
adapted
to
the
conditions
that
no
improvement
upon
it
is
possible
it
will
persist
because
though
it
does
not
cease
to
vary
the
varieties
will
be
inferior
to
itself
if
as
is
more
probable
the
new
variety
is
by
no
means
perfectly
adapted
to
its
conditions
but
only
fairly
well
adapted
to
them
it
will
persist
so
long
as
none
of
the
varieties
which
it
throws
off
are
better
adapted
than
itself
on
the
other
hand
as
soon
as
it
varies
in
a
useful
way
when
the
variation
is
such
as
to
adapt
it
more
perfectly
to
its
conditions
the
fresh
variety
will
tend
to
supplant
the
former
so
far
from
a
gradual
progress
towards
perfection
forming
any
necessary
part
of
the
darwinian
creed
it
appears
to
us
that
it
is
perfectly
consistent
with
indefinite
persistence
in
one
state
or
with
a
gradual
retrogression
suppose
for
example
a
return
of
the
glacial
epoch
and
a
spread
of
polar
climatal
conditions
over
the
whole
globe
the
operation
of
natural
selection
under
these
circumstances
would
tend
on
the
whole
to
the
weeding
out
of
the
higher
organisms
and
the
cherishing
of
the
lower
forms
of
life
cryptogamic
vegetation
would
have
the
advantage
over
phanerogamic
over
corals
over
and
and
over
the
higher
cetaceans
and
seals
over
the
the
civilization
of
the
esquimaux
over
that
of
the
european
pelzeln
has
also
objected
that
if
the
later
organisms
have
proceeded
from
the
earlier
the
whole
developmental
series
from
the
simplest
to
the
highest
could
not
now
exist
in
such
a
case
the
simpler
organisms
must
have
disappeared
to
this
professor
k√∂lliker
replies
with
perfect
justice
that
the
conclusion
drawn
by
pelzeln
does
not
really
follow
from
premises
and
that
if
we
take
the
facts
of
pal√¶ontology
as
they
stand
they
rather
support
than
oppose
darwin
theory
great
weight
must
be
attached
to
the
objection
brought
forward
by
huxley
otherwise
a
warm
supporter
of
darwin
hypothesis
that
we
know
of
no
varieties
which
are
sterile
with
one
another
as
is
the
rule
among
sharply
distinguished
animal
forms
if
darwin
is
right
it
must
be
demonstrated
that
forms
may
be
produced
by
selection
which
like
the
present
sharply
distinguished
animal
forms
are
infertile
when
coupled
with
one
another
and
this
has
not
been
done
the
weight
of
this
objection
is
obvious
but
our
ignorance
of
the
conditions
of
fertility
and
sterility
the
want
of
carefully
conducted
experiments
extending
over
long
series
of
years
and
the
strange
anomalies
presented
by
the
results
of
the
of
many
plants
should
all
as
darwin
has
urged
be
taken
into
account
in
considering
it
the
seventh
objection
is
that
we
have
already
discussed
the
eighth
and
last
stands
as
follows
the
developmental
theory
of
darwin
is
not
needed
to
enable
us
to
understand
the
regular
harmonious
progress
of
the
complete
series
of
organic
forms
from
the
simpler
to
the
more
perfect
the
existence
of
general
laws
of
nature
explains
this
harmony
even
if
we
assume
that
all
beings
have
arisen
separately
and
independent
of
one
another
darwin
forgets
that
inorganic
nature
in
which
there
can
be
no
thought
of
a
genetic
connexion
of
forms
exhibits
the
same
regular
plan
the
same
harmony
as
the
organic
world
and
that
to
cite
only
one
example
there
is
as
much
a
natural
system
of
minerals
as
of
plants
and
animals
we
do
not
feel
quite
sure
that
we
seize
professor
k√∂lliker
meaning
here
but
he
appears
to
suggest
that
the
observation
of
the
general
order
and
harmony
which
pervade
inorganic
nature
would
lead
us
to
anticipate
a
similar
order
and
harmony
in
the
organic
world
and
this
is
no
doubt
true
but
it
by
no
means
follows
that
the
particular
order
and
harmony
observed
among
them
should
be
that
which
we
see
surely
the
stripes
of
dun
horses
and
the
teeth
of
the
foetal
are
not
explained
by
the
existence
of
general
laws
of
nature
darwin
endeavours
to
explain
the
exact
order
of
organic
nature
which
exists
not
the
mere
fact
that
there
is
some
order
and
with
regard
to
the
existence
of
a
natural
system
of
minerals
the
obvious
reply
is
that
there
may
be
a
natural
classification
of
any
objects
of
stones
on
a
or
of
works
of
art
a
natural
classification
being
simply
an
assemblage
of
objects
in
groups
so
as
to
express
their
most
important
and
fundamental
resemblances
and
differences
no
doubt
darwin
believes
that
those
resemblances
and
differences
upon
which
our
natural
systems
or
classifications
of
animals
and
plants
are
based
are
resemblances
and
differences
which
have
been
produced
genetically
but
we
can
discover
no
reason
for
supposing
that
he
denies
the
existence
of
natural
classifications
of
other
kinds
and
after
all
is
it
quite
so
certain
that
a
genetic
relation
may
not
underlie
the
classification
of
minerals
the
inorganic
world
has
not
always
been
what
we
see
it
it
has
certainly
had
its
metamorphoses
and
very
probably
a
long
entwickelungsgeschichte
out
of
a
nebular
blastema
who
knows
how
far
that
amount
of
likeness
among
sets
of
minerals
in
virtue
of
which
they
are
now
grouped
into
families
and
orders
may
not
be
the
expression
of
the
common
conditions
to
which
that
particular
patch
of
nebulous
fog
which
may
have
been
constituted
by
their
atoms
and
of
which
they
may
be
in
the
strictest
sense
the
descendants
was
subjected
it
will
be
obvious
from
what
has
preceded
that
we
do
not
agree
with
professor
k√∂lliker
in
thinking
the
objections
which
he
brings
forward
so
weighty
as
to
be
fatal
to
darwin
view
but
even
if
the
case
were
otherwise
we
should
be
unable
to
accept
the
theory
of
heterogeneous
generation
which
is
offered
as
a
substitute
that
theory
is
thus
stated
the
fundamental
conception
of
this
hypothesis
is
that
under
the
influence
of
a
general
law
of
development
the
germs
of
organisms
produce
others
different
from
themselves
this
might
happen
by
the
fecundated
ova
passing
in
the
course
of
their
development
under
particular
circumstances
into
higher
forms
by
the
primitive
and
later
organisms
producing
other
organisms
without
fecundation
out
of
germs
or
eggs
parthenogenesis
in
favour
of
this
hypothesis
professor
k√∂lliker
adduces
the
facts
of
agamogenesis
or
alternate
generation
the
extreme
dissimilarity
of
the
males
and
females
of
many
animals
and
of
the
males
females
and
neuters
of
those
insects
which
live
in
colonies
and
he
defines
its
relations
to
the
darwinian
theory
as
follows
it
is
obvious
that
my
hypothesis
is
apparently
very
similar
to
darwin
inasmuch
as
i
also
consider
that
the
various
forms
of
animals
have
proceeded
directly
from
one
another
my
hypothesis
of
the
creation
of
organisms
by
heterogeneous
generation
however
is
distinguished
very
essentially
from
darwin
by
the
entire
absence
of
the
principle
of
useful
variations
and
their
natural
selection
and
my
fundamental
conception
is
this
that
a
great
plan
of
development
lies
at
the
foundation
of
the
origin
of
the
whole
organic
world
impelling
the
simpler
forms
to
more
and
more
complex
developments
how
this
law
operates
what
influences
determine
the
development
of
the
eggs
and
germs
and
impel
them
to
assume
constantly
new
forms
i
naturally
can
not
pretend
to
say
but
i
can
at
least
adduce
the
great
analogy
of
the
alternation
of
generations
if
a
a
a
is
competent
to
produce
the
echinoderm
which
is
so
widely
different
from
it
if
a
hydroid
polype
can
produce
the
higher
medusa
if
the
vermiform
trematode
can
develop
within
itself
the
very
unlike
it
will
not
appear
impossible
that
the
egg
or
ciliated
embryo
of
a
sponge
for
once
under
special
conditions
might
become
a
hydroid
polype
or
the
embryo
of
a
medusa
an
echinoderm
it
is
obvious
from
these
extracts
that
professor
k√∂lliker
hypothesis
is
based
upon
the
supposed
existence
of
a
close
analogy
between
the
ph√¶nomena
of
agamogenesis
and
the
production
of
new
species
from
ones
but
is
the
analogy
a
real
one
we
think
that
it
is
not
and
by
the
hypothesis
can
not
be
for
what
are
the
ph√¶nomena
of
agamogenesis
stated
generally
an
impregnated
egg
develops
into
an
asexual
form
a
this
gives
rise
asexually
to
a
second
form
or
forms
b
more
or
less
different
from
a
b
may
multiply
asexually
again
in
the
simpler
cases
however
it
does
not
but
acquiring
sexual
characters
produces
impregnated
eggs
from
whence
a
once
more
arises
no
case
of
agamogenesis
is
known
in
which
a
differs
widely
from
it
is
itself
capable
of
sexual
propagation
no
case
whatever
is
known
in
which
the
progeny
of
b
by
sexual
generation
is
other
than
a
reproduction
of
a
but
if
this
be
a
true
statement
of
the
nature
of
the
process
of
agamogenesis
how
can
it
enable
us
to
comprehend
the
production
of
new
species
from
already
existing
ones
let
us
suppose
hy√¶nas
to
have
preceded
dogs
and
to
have
produced
the
latter
in
this
way
then
the
hy√¶na
will
represent
a
and
the
dog
b
the
first
difficulty
that
presents
itself
is
that
the
hy√¶na
must
be
asexual
or
the
process
will
be
wholly
without
analogy
in
the
world
of
agamogenesis
but
passing
over
this
difficulty
and
supposing
a
male
and
female
dog
to
be
produced
at
the
same
time
from
the
hy√¶na
stock
the
progeny
of
the
pair
if
the
analogy
of
the
simpler
kinds
of
agamogenesis
is
to
be
followed
should
be
a
litter
not
of
puppies
but
of
young
hy√¶nas
for
the
agamogenetic
series
is
always
as
we
have
seen
a
b
a
b
whereas
for
the
production
of
a
new
species
the
series
must
be
a
b
b
b
the
production
of
new
species
or
genera
is
the
extreme
permanent
divergence
from
the
primitive
stock
all
known
agamogenetic
processes
on
the
other
hand
end
in
a
complete
return
to
the
primitive
stock
how
then
is
the
production
of
new
species
to
be
rendered
intelligible
by
the
analogy
of
agamogenesis
the
other
alternative
put
by
professor
k√∂lliker
the
passage
of
fecundated
ova
in
the
course
of
their
development
into
higher
forms
would
if
it
occurred
be
merely
an
extreme
case
of
variation
in
the
darwinian
sense
greater
in
degree
than
but
perfectly
similar
in
kind
to
that
which
occurred
when
the
ancon
ram
was
developed
from
an
ordinary
ewe
ovum
indeed
we
have
always
thought
that
darwin
has
unnecessarily
hampered
himself
by
adhering
so
strictly
to
his
favourite
natura
non
facit
saltum
we
greatly
suspect
that
she
does
make
considerable
jumps
in
the
way
of
variation
now
and
then
and
that
these
saltations
give
rise
to
some
of
the
gaps
which
appear
to
exist
in
the
series
of
known
forms
strongly
and
freely
as
we
have
ventured
to
disagree
with
professor
k√∂lliker
we
have
always
done
so
with
regret
and
we
trust
without
violating
that
respect
which
is
due
not
only
to
his
scientific
eminence
and
to
the
careful
study
which
he
has
devoted
to
the
subject
but
to
the
perfect
fairness
of
his
argumentation
and
the
generous
appreciation
of
the
worth
of
darwin
labours
which
he
always
displays
it
would
be
satisfactory
to
be
able
to
say
as
much
for
flourens
but
the
perpetual
secretary
of
the
french
academy
of
sciences
deals
with
darwin
as
the
first
napoleon
would
have
treated
an
id√©ologue
and
while
displaying
a
painful
weakness
of
logic
and
shallowness
of
information
assumes
a
tone
of
authority
which
always
touches
upon
the
ludicrous
and
sometimes
passes
the
limits
of
good
breeding

in

we
do
not

to
have

these

laid

therefore
to

effected
solely
by
the

the
lucidity

of
the

of
flourens

to
flourens
darwin
great
error
is
that

further
that

has
imagined

he
imagines
afterwards
that

of
selecting
which
he
gives
to

is
similar
to
the

of

two
suppositions
admitted
nothing
stops
him
he
plays
with

he
likes

makes
her
do

and
this
is
really
all
that
flourens
can
make
of
natural
selection
we
have
given
the
original
in
fear
lest
a
translation
should
be
regarded
as
a
travesty
but
with
the
original
before
the
reader
we
may
try
to
analyse
the
passage
for
an
organized
being
nature
is
only
organization
neither
more
nor
less
organized
beings
then
have
absolutely
no
relation
to
inorganic
nature
a
plant
does
not
depend
on
soil
or
sunshine
climate
depth
in
the
ocean
height
above
it
the
quantity
of
saline
matters
in
water
have
no
influence
upon
animal
life
the
substitution
of
carbonic
acid
for
oxygen
in
our
atmosphere
would
hurt
nobody
that
these
are
absurdities
no
one
should
know
better
than
flourens
but
they
are
logical
deductions
from
the
assertion
just
quoted
and
from
the
further
statement
that
natural
selection
means
only
that
organization
chooses
and
selects
organization
for
if
it
be
once
admitted
what
no
sane
man
denies
that
the
chances
of
life
of
any
given
organism
are
increased
by
certain
conditions
a
and
diminished
by
their
opposites
b
then
it
is
mathematically
certain
that
any
change
of
conditions
in
the
direction
of
a
will
exercise
a
selective
influence
in
favour
of
that
organism
tending
to
its
increase
and
multiplication
while
any
change
in
the
direction
of
b
will
exercise
a
selective
influence
against
that
organism
tending
to
its
decrease
and
extinction
or
on
the
other
hand
conditions
remaining
the
same
let
a
given
organism
vary
and
no
one
doubts
that
they
do
vary
in
two
directions
into
one
form
a
better
fitted
to
cope
with
these
conditions
than
the
original
stock
and
a
second
b
less
well
adapted
to
them
then
it
is
no
less
certain
that
the
conditions
in
question
must
exercise
a
selective
influence
in
favour
of
a
and
against
b
so
that
a
will
tend
to
predominance
and
b
to
extirpation
that
flourens
should
be
unable
to
perceive
the
logical
necessity
of
these
simple
arguments
which
lie
at
the
foundation
of
all
reasoning
that
he
should
confound
an
irrefragable
deduction
from
the
observed
relations
of
organisms
to
the
conditions
which
lie
around
them
with
a
metaphysical
forme
substantielle
or
a
chimerical
personification
of
the
powers
of
nature
would
be
incredible
were
it
not
that
other

of
his

leave

so

will
probably
have
passed
through
the

will
have
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
the
formation
of

on
a
grand
scale
what
are
these
dunes
the
winds

of
the

of

have
not
much
consciousness

yet
they
have
with
great

selected

and

which
have
been
submitted

all
the

of

have
heaped
them

themselves
over

this

it

lay

is
one
of

great
services
to

that
he
has
demonstrated
the
significance
of
these

he
has
shown
that
given
variation
and
given
change
of

the
inevitable
result
is
the
exercise
of
such
an
influence
upon
organisms
that
one
is
helped
and
another
is
impeded

tends
to
predominate
another
to
disappear

thus
the

bears
within
itself

is
surrounded
by
impulses
towards
incessant
change

the

just
stated
are
as

any

physical
laws
quite
independently
of
the

of
the
hypothesis
which
darwin
has
based
upon
them
and
that
flourens
missing
the
substance
and
grasping
at
a
shadow
should
be
blind
to
the
admirable

for
the
moment
of
he
imagined
p
on
the
contrary
says
flourens
the
new
being
is
formed
at
a
stroke
as
a
whole
instantaneously
it
is
not
formed
part
by
part
and
at
different
times
it
is
formed
at
once
it
is
formed
at
the
single
moment
at
which
the
conjunction
of
the
male
and
female
elements
takes
place
it
will
be
observed
that
flourens
uses
language
which
can
not
be
mistaken
for
him
the
labours
of
von

of
rathke
of

and
their
contemporaries

successors
in

france

are

as
darwin
natural
selection
so
harvey
that
doctrine
which
gives
him
an
even
greater
claim
to
the
veneration
of
posterity
than
his
better
known
discovery
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
language
such
as
that
we
have
quoted
is
in
fact
so
preposterous
so
utterly
incompatible
with
anything
but
absolute
ignorance
of
some
of
the
best
established
facts
that
we
should
have
passed
it
over
in
silence
had
it
not
appeared
to
afford
some
clue
to
flourens
unhesitating
repudiation
of
all
forms
of
the
doctrine
of
the
progressive
modification
of
living
beings
he
whose
mind
remains
uninfluenced
by
an
acquaintance
with
the
ph√¶nomena
of

must
indeed
lack
one
of
the
chief
motives
towards
the
endeavour
to
trace
a
genetic
relation
between
the
different
existing
forms
of
life
those
who
are
ignorant
of
geology
find
no
difficulty
in
believing
that
the
world
was
made
as
it
is
and
the
shepherd
untutored
in
history
sees
no
reason
to
regard
the
green
mounds
which
indicate
the
site
of
a
roman
camp
as
aught
but
part
and
parcel
of
the
prim√¶val
so
flourens
who
believes
that
embryos
are
formed
tout

naturally
finds
no
difficulty
in
conceiving
that
species
came

existence

to

hypothesis
xiv
on
descartes
discourse
touching
the
method
of
using
one
reason
rightly
and
of
seeking
scientific
truth
it
has
been
well
said
that
all
the
thoughts
of
men
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
until
now
are
linked
together
into
one
great
chain
but
the
conception
of
the
intellectual
filiation
of
mankind
which
is
expressed
in
these
words
may
perhaps
be
more
fitly
shadowed
forth
by
a
different
metaphor
the
thoughts
of
men
seem
rather
to
be
comparable
to
the
leaves
flowers
and
fruit
upon
the
innumerable
branches
of
a
few
great
stems
fed
by
commingled
and
hidden
roots
these
stems
bear
the
names
of
the
men
endowed
with
intellects
of
heroic
force
and
clearness
to
whom
we
are
led
at
whatever
point
of
the
world
of
thought
the
attempt
to
trace
its
history
commences
just
as
certainly
as
the
following
up
the
small
twigs
of
a
tree
to
the
branchlets
which
bear
them
and
tracing
the
branchlets
to
their
supporting
branches
brings
us
sooner
or
later
to
the
bole
it
seems
to
me
that
the
thinker
who
more
than
any
other
stands
in
the
relation
of
such
a
stem
towards
the
philosophy
and
the
science
of
the
modern
world
is
ren√©
descartes
i
mean
that
if
you
lay
hold
of
any
characteristic
product
of
modern
ways
of
thinking
either
in
the
region
of
philosophy
or
in
that
of
science
you
find
the
spirit
of
that
thought
if
not
its
form
to
have
been
present
in
the
mind
of
the
great
frenchman
there
are
some
men
who
are
counted
great
because
they
represent
the
actuality
of
their
own
age
and
mirror
it
as
it
is
such
an
one
was
voltaire
of
whom
it
was
epigrammatically
said
he
expressed
everybody
thoughts
better
than
anybody
but
there
are
other
men
who
attain
greatness
because
they
embody
the
potentiality
of
their
own
day
and
magically
reflect
the
future
they
express
the
thoughts
which
will
be
everybody
two
or
three
centuries
after
them
such
an
one
was
descartes
born
in
nearly
three
hundred
years
ago
of
a
noble
family
in
touraine
ren√©
descartes
grew
up
into
a
sickly
and
diminutive
child
whose
keen
wit
soon
gained
him
that
title
of
the
philosopher
which
in
the
mouths
of
his
noble
kinsmen
was
more
than
half
a
reproach
the
best
schoolmasters
of
the
day
the
jesuits
educated
him
as
well
as
a
french
boy
of
the
seventeenth
century
could
be
educated
and
they
must
have
done
their
work
honestly
and
well
for
before
his
schoolboy
days
were
over
he
had
discovered
that
the
most
of
what
he
had
learned
except
in
mathematics
was
devoid
of
solid
and
real
value
therefore
says
he
in
that
discourse
which
i
have
taken
for
my
text
as
soon
as
i
was
old
enough
to
be
set
free
from
the
government
of
my
teachers
i
entirely
forsook
the
study
of
letters
and
determining
to
seek
no
other
knowledge
than
that
which
i
could
discover
within
myself
or
in
the
great
book
of
the
world
i
spent
the
remainder
of
my
youth
in
travelling
in
seeing
courts
and
armies
in
the
society
of
people
of
different
humours
and
conditions
in
gathering
varied
experience
in
testing
myself
by
the
chances
of
fortune
and
in
always
trying
to
profit
by
my
reflections
on
what
happened
and
i
always
had
an
intense
desire
to
learn
how
to
distinguish
truth
from
falsehood
in
order
to
be
clear
about
my
actions
and
to
walk
surefootedly
in
this
life
but
learn
what
is
true
in
order
to
do
what
is
right
is
the
summing
up
of
the
whole
duty
of
man
for
all
who
are
unable
to
satisfy
their
mental
hunger
with
the
east
wind
of
authority
and
to
those
of
us
moderns
who
are
in
this
position
it
is
one
of
descartes
great
claims
to
our
reverence
as
a
spiritual
ancestor
that
at
he
saw
clearly
that
this
was
his
duty
and
acted
up
to
his
conviction
at
in
fact
finding
all
other
occupations
incompatible
with
the
search
after
the
knowledge
which
leads
to
action
and
being
possessed
of
a
modest
competence
he
withdrew
into
holland
where
he
spent
nine
years
in
learning
and
thinking
in
such
retirement
that
only
one
or
two
trusted
friends
knew
of
his
whereabouts
in
the
firstfruits
of
these
long
meditations
were
given
to
the
world
in
the
famous
discourse
touching
the
method
of
using
reason
rightly
and
of
seeking
scientific
truth
which
at
once
an
autobiography
and
a
philosophy
clothes
the
deepest
thought
in
language
of
exquisite
harmony
simplicity
and
clearness
the
central
propositions
of
the
whole
discourse
are
these
there
is
a
path
that
leads
to
truth
so
surely
that
if
any
one
who
will
follow
it
must
needs
reach
the
goal
whether
his
capacity
be
great
or
small
and
there
is
one
guiding
rule
by
which
a
man
may
always
find
this
path
and
keep
himself
from
straying
when
he
has
found
it
this
golden
rule
is
give
unqualified
assent
to
no
propositions
but
those
the
truth
of
which
is
so
clear
and
distinct
that
they
can
not
be
doubted
the
enunciation
of
this
great
first
commandment
of
science
consecrated
doubt
it
removed
doubt
from
the
seat
of
penance
among
the
grievous
sins
to
which
it
had
long
been
condemned
and
enthroned
it
in
that
high
place
among
the
primary
duties
which
is
assigned
to
it
by
the
scientific
conscience
of
these
latter
days
descartes
was
the
first
among
the
moderns
to
obey
this
commandment
deliberately
and
as
a
matter
of
religious
duty
to
strip
off
all
his
beliefs
and
reduce
himself
to
a
state
of
intellectual
nakedness
until
such
time
as
he
could
satisfy
himself
which
were
fit
to
be
worn
he
thought
a
bare
skin
healthier
than
the
most
respectable
and
clothing
of
what
might
possibly
be
mere
shoddy
when
i
say
that
descartes
consecrated
doubt
you
must
remember
that
it
was
that
sort
of
doubt
which
goethe
has
called
the
active
scepticism
whose
whole
aim
is
to
conquer
itself
and
not
that
other
sort
which
is
born
of
flippancy
and
ignorance
and
whose
aim
is
only
to
perpetuate
itself
as
an
excuse
for
idleness
and
indifference
but
it
is
impossible
to
define
what
is
meant
by
scientific
doubt
better
than
in
own
words
after
describing
the
gradual
progress
of
his
negative
criticism
he
tells
us
for
all
that
i
did
not
imitate
the
sceptics
who
doubt
only
for
doubting
sake
and
pretend
to
be
always
undecided
on
the
contrary
my
whole
intention
was
to
arrive
at
certainty
and
to
dig
away
the
drift
and
the
sand
until
i
reached
the
rock
or
the
clay
beneath
and
further
since
no
man
of
common
sense
when
he
pulls
down
his
house
for
the
purpose
of
rebuilding
it
fails
to
provide
himself
with
some
shelter
while
the
work
is
in
progress
so
before
demolishing
the
spacious
if
not
commodious
mansion
of
his
old
beliefs
descartes
thought
it
wise
to
equip
himself
with
what
he
calls
morale
par
by
which
he
resolved
to
govern
his
practical
life
until
such
time
as
he
should
be
better
instructed
the
laws
of
this
provisional
are
embodied
in
four
maxims
of
which
one
binds
our
philosopher
to
submit
himself
to
the
laws
and
religion
in
which
he
was
brought
up
another
to
act
on
all
those
occasions
which
call
for
action
promptly
and
according
to
the
best
of
his
judgment
and
to
abide
without
repining
by
the
result
a
third
rule
is
to
seek
happiness
in
limiting
his
desires
rather
than
in
attempting
to
satisfy
them
while
the
last
is
to
make
the
search
after
truth
the
business
of
his
life
thus
prepared
to
go
on
living
while
he
doubted
descartes
proceeded
to
face
his
doubts
like
a
man
one
thing
was
clear
to
him
he
would
not
lie
to
himself
would
under
no
penalties
say
i
am
sure
of
that
of
which
he
was
not
sure
but
would
go
on
digging
and
delving
until
he
came
to
the
solid
adamant
or
at
worst
made
sure
there
was
no
adamant
as
the
record
of
his
progress
tells
us
he
was
obliged
to
confess
that
life
is
full
of
delusions
that
authority
may
err
that
testimony
may
be
false
or
mistaken
that
reason
lands
us
in
endless
fallacies
that
memory
is
often
as
little
trustworthy
as
hope
that
the
evidence
of
the
very
senses
may
be
misunderstood
that
dreams
are
real
as
long
as
they
last
and
that
what
we
call
reality
may
be
a
long
and
restless
dream
nay
it
is
conceivable
that
some
powerful
and
malicious
being
may
find
his
pleasure
in
deluding
us
and
in
making
us
believe
the
thing
which
is
not
every
moment
of
our
lives
what
then
is
certain
what
even
if
such
a
being
exists
is
beyond
the
reach
of
his
powers
of
delusion
why
the
fact
that
the
thought
the
present
consciousness
exists
our
thoughts
may
be
delusive
but
they
can
not
be
fictitious
as
thoughts
they
are
real
and
existent
and
the
cleverest
deceiver
can
not
make
them
otherwise
thus
thought
is
existence
more
than
that
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
existence
is
thought
all
our
conceptions
of
existence
being
some
kind
or
other
of
thought
do
not
for
a
moment
suppose
that
these
are
mere
paradoxes
or
subtleties
a
little
reflection
upon
the
commonest
facts
proves
them
to
be
irrefragable
truths
for
example
i
take
up
a
marble
and
i
find
it
to
be
a
red
round
hard
single
body
we
call
the
redness
the
roundness
the
hardness
and
the
singleness
qualities
of
the
marble
and
it
sounds
at
first
the
height
of
absurdity
to
say
that
all
these
qualities
are
modes
of
our
own
consciousness
which
can
not
even
be
conceived
to
exist
in
the
marble
but
consider
the
redness
to
begin
with
how
does
the
sensation
of
redness
arise
the
waves
of
a
certain
very
attenuated
matter
the
particles
of
which
are
vibrating
with
vast
rapidity
but
with
very
different
velocities
strike
upon
the
marble
and
those
which
vibrate
with
one
particular
velocity
are
thrown
off
from
its
surface
in
all
directions
the
optical
apparatus
of
the
eye
gathers
some
of
these
together
and
gives
them
such
a
course
that
they
impinge
upon
the
surface
of
the
retina
which
is
a
singularly
delicate
apparatus
connected
with
the
termination
of
the
fibres
of
the
optic
nerve
the
impulses
of
the
attenuated
matter
or
ether
affect
this
apparatus
and
the
fibres
of
the
optic
nerve
in
a
certain
way
and
the
change
in
the
fibres
of
the
optic
nerve
produces
yet
other
changes
in
the
brain
and
these
in
some
fashion
unknown
to
us
give
rise
to
the
feeling
or
consciousness
of
redness
if
the
marble
could
remain
unchanged
and
either
the
rate
of
vibration
of
the
ether
or
the
nature
of
the
retina
could
be
altered
the
marble
would
seem
not
red
but
some
other
colour
there
are
many
people
who
are
what
are
called
colourblind
being
unable
to
distinguish
one
colour
from
another
such
an
one
might
declare
our
marble
to
be
green
and
he
would
be
quite
as
right
in
saying
that
it
is
green
as
we
are
in
declaring
it
to
be
red
but
then
as
the
marble
can
not
in
itself
be
both
green
and
red
at
the
same
time
this
shows
that
the
quality
redness
must
be
in
our
consciousness
and
not
in
the
marble
in
like
manner
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
roundness
and
the
hardness
are
forms
of
our
consciousness
belonging
to
the
groups
which
we
call
sensations
of
sight
and
touch
if
the
surface
of
the
cornea
were
cylindrical
we
should
have
a
very
different
notion
of
a
round
body
from
that
which
we
possess
now
and
if
the
strength
of
the
fabric
and
the
force
of
the
muscles
of
the
body
were
increased
a
hundredfold
our
marble
would
seem
to
be
as
soft
as
a
pellet
of
bread
crumbs
not
only
is
it
obvious
that
all
these
qualities
are
in
us
but
if
you
will
make
the
attempt
you
will
find
it
quite
impossible
to
conceive
of
blueness
roundness
and
hardness
as
existing
without
reference
to
some
such
consciousness
as
our
own
it
may
seem
strange
to
say
that
even
the
singleness
of
the
marble
is
relative
to
us
but
extremely
simple
experiments
will
show
that
such
is
veritably
the
case
and
that
our
two
most
trustworthy
senses
may
be
made
to
contradict
one
another
on
this
very
point
hold
the
marble
between
the
finger
and
thumb
and
look
at
it
in
the
ordinary
way
sight
and
touch
agree
that
it
is
single
now
squint
and
sight
tells
you
that
there
are
two
marbles
while
touch
asserts
that
there
is
only
one
next
return
the
eyes
to
their
natural
position
and
having
crossed
the
forefinger
and
the
middle
finger
put
the
marble
between
their
tips
then
touch
will
declare
that
there
are
two
marbles
while
sight
says
that
there
is
only
one
and
touch
claims
our
belief
when
we
attend
to
it
just
as
imperatively
as
sight
does
but
it
may
be
said
the
marble
takes
up
a
certain
space
which
could
not
be
occupied
at
the
same
time
by
anything
else
in
other
words
the
marble
has
the
primary
quality
of
matter
extension
surely
this
quality
must
be
in
the
thing
and
not
in
our
minds
but
the
reply
must
still
be
whatever
may
or
may
not
exist
in
the
thing
all
that
we
can
know
of
these
qualities
is
a
state
of
consciousness
what
we
call
extension
is
a
consciousness
of
a
relation
between
two
or
more
affections
of
the
sense
of
sight
or
of
touch
and
it
is
wholly
inconceivable
that
what
we
call
extension
should
exist
independently
of
such
consciousness
as
our
own
whether
notwithstanding
this
inconceivability
it
does
so
exist
or
not
is
a
point
on
which
i
offer
no
opinion
thus
whatever
our
marble
may
be
in
itself
all
that
we
can
know
of
it
is
under
the
shape
of
a
bundle
of
our
own
consciousnesses
nor
is
our
knowledge
of
anything
we
know
or
feel
more
or
less
than
a
knowledge
of
states
of
consciousness
and
our
whole
life
is
made
up
of
such
states
some
of
these
states
we
refer
to
a
cause
we
call
self
others
to
a
cause
or
causes
which
may
be
comprehended
under
the
title
of
but
neither
of
the
existence
of
self
nor
of
that
of
have
we
or
can
we
by
any
possibility
have
any
such
unquestionable
and
immediate
certainty
as
we
have
of
the
states
of
consciousness
which
we
consider
to
be
their
effects
they
are
not
immediately
observed
facts
but
results
of
the
application
of
the
law
of
causation
to
those
facts
strictly
speaking
the
existence
of
a
self
and
of
a
are
hypotheses
by
which
we
account
for
the
facts
of
consciousness
they
stand
upon
the
same
footing
as
the
belief
in
the
general
trustworthiness
of
memory
and
in
the
general
constancy
of
the
order
of
nature
as
hypothetical
assumptions
which
can
not
be
proved
or
known
with
that
highest
degree
of
certainty
which
is
given
by
immediate
consciousness
but
which
nevertheless
are
of
the
highest
practical
value
inasmuch
as
the
conclusions
logically
drawn
from
them
are
always
verified
by
experience
this
in
my
judgment
is
the
ultimate
issue
of
descartes
argument
but
it
is
proper
for
me
to
point
out
that
we
have
left
descartes
himself
some
way
behind
us
he
stopped
at
the
famous
formula
i
think
therefore
i
am
but
a
little
consideration
will
show
this
formula
to
be
full
of
snares
and
verbal
entanglements
in
the
first
place
the
therefore
has
no
business
there
the
i
am
is
assumed
in
the
i
think
which
is
simply
another
way
of
saying
i
am
thinking
and
in
the
second
place
i
think
is
not
one
simple
proposition
but
three
distinct
assertions
rolled
into
one
the
first
of
these
is
something
called
i
exists
the
second
is
something
called
thought
exists
and
the
third
is
the
thought
is
the
result
of
the
action
of
the
i
now
it
will
be
obvious
to
you
that
the
only
one
of
these
three
propositions
which
can
stand
the
cartesian
test
of
certainty
is
the
second
it
can
not
be
doubted
for
the
very
doubt
is
an
existent
thought
but
the
first
and
third
whether
true
or
not
may
be
doubted
and
have
been
doubted
for
the
assertor
may
be
asked
how
do
you
know
that
thought
is
not
or
that
a
given
thought
is
not
the
effect
of
its
antecedent
thought
or
of
some
external
power
and
a
diversity
of
other
questions
much
more
easily
put
than
answered
descartes
determined
as
he
was
to
strip
off
all
the
garments
which
the
intellect
weaves
for
itself
forgot
this
gossamer
shirt
of
the
self
to
the
great
detriment
and
indeed
ruin
of
his
toilet
when
he
began
to
clothe
himself
again
but
it
is
beside
my
purpose
to
dwell
upon
the
minor
peculiarities
of
the
cartesian
philosophy
all
i
wish
to
put
clearly
before
your
minds
thus
far
is
that
descartes
having
commenced
by
declaring
doubt
to
be
a
duty
found
certainty
in
consciousness
alone
and
that
the
necessary
outcome
of
his
views
is
what
may
properly
be
termed
idealism
namely
the
doctrine
that
whatever
the
universe
may
be
all
we
can
know
of
it
is
the
picture
presented
to
us
by
consciousness
this
picture
may
be
a
true
likeness
though
how
this
can
be
is
inconceivable
or
it
may
have
no
more
resemblance
to
its
cause
than
one
of
bach
fugues
has
to
the
person
who
is
playing
it
or
than
a
piece
of
poetry
has
to
the
mouth
and
lips
of
a
reciter
it
is
enough
for
all
the
practical
purposes
of
human
existence
if
we
find
that
our
trust
in
the
representations
of
consciousness
is
verified
by
results
and
that
by
their
help
we
are
enabled
to
walk
surefootedly
in
this
life
thus
the
method
or
path
which
leads
to
truth
indicated
by
descartes
takes
us
straight
to
the
critical
idealism
of
his
great
successor
kant
it
is
that
idealism
which
declares
the
ultimate
fact
of
all
knowledge
to
be
a
consciousness
or
in
other
words
a
mental
phenomenon
and
therefore
affirms
the
highest
of
all
certainties
and
indeed
the
only
absolute
certainty
to
be
the
existence
of
mind
but
it
is
also
that
idealism
which
refuses
to
make
any
assertions
either
positive
or
negative
as
to
what
lies
beyond
consciousness
it
accuses
the
subtle
berkeley
of
stepping
beyond
the
limits
of
knowledge
when
he
declared
that
a
substance
of
matter
does
not
exist
and
of
illogicality
for
not
seeing
that
the
arguments
which
he
supposed
demolished
the
existence
of
matter
were
equally
destructive
to
the
existence
of
soul
and
it
refuses
to
listen
to
the
jargon
of
more
recent
days
about
the
absolute
and
all
the
other
hypostatized
adjectives
the
initial
letters
of
the
names
of
which
are
generally
printed
in
capital
letters
just
as
you
give
a
grenadier
a
bearskin
cap
to
make
him
look
more
formidable
than
he
is
by
nature
i
repeat
the
path
indicated
and
followed
by
descartes
which
we
have
hitherto
been
treading
leads
through
doubt
to
that
critical
idealism
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
modern
metaphysical
thought
but
the
discourse
shows
us
another
and
apparently
very
different
path
which
leads
quite
as
definitely
to
that
correlation
of
all
the
ph√¶nomena
of
the
universe
with
matter
and
motion
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
modern
physical
thought
and
which
most
people
call
materialism
the
early
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
when
descartes
reached
manhood
is
one
of
the
great
epochs
of
the
intellectual
life
of
mankind
at
that
time
physical
science
suddenly
strode
into
the
arena
of
public
and
familiar
thought
and
openly
challenged
not
only
philosophy
and
the
church
but
that
common
ignorance
which
passes
by
the
name
of
common
sense
the
assertion
of
the
motion
of
the
earth
was
a
defiance
to
all
three
and
physical
science
threw
down
her
glove
by
the
hand
of
galileo
it
is
not
pleasant
to
think
of
the
immediate
result
of
the
combat
to
see
the
champion
of
science
old
worn
and
on
his
knees
before
the
cardinal
inquisitor
signing
his
name
to
what
he
knew
to
be
a
lie
and
no
doubt
the
cardinals
rubbed
their
hands
as
they
thought
how
well
they
had
silenced
and
discredited
their
adversary
but
two
hundred
years
have
passed
and
however
feeble
or
faulty
her
soldiers
physical
science
sits
crowned
and
enthroned
as
one
of
the
legitimate
rulers
of
the
world
of
thought
charity
children
would
be
ashamed
not
to
know
that
the
earth
moves
while
the
schoolmen
are
forgotten
and
the
cardinals
well
the
cardinals
are
at
the
oecumenical
council
still
at
their
old
business
of
trying
to
stop
the
movement
of
the
world
as
a
ship
which
having
lain
becalmed
with
every
stitch
of
canvas
set
bounds
away
before
the
breeze
which
springs
up
astern
so
the
mind
of
descartes
poised
in
equilibrium
of
doubt
not
only
yielded
to
the
full
force
of
the
impulse
towards
physical
science
and
physical
ways
of
thought
given
by
his
great
contemporaries
galileo
and
harvey
but
shot
beyond
them
and
anticipated
by
bold
speculation
the
conclusions
which
could
only
be
placed
upon
a
secure
foundation
by
the
labours
of
generations
of
workers
descartes
saw
that
the
discoveries
of
galileo
meant
that
the
remotest
parts
of
the
universe
were
governed
by
mechanical
laws
while
those
of
harvey
meant
that
the
same
laws
presided
over
the
operations
of
that
portion
of
the
world
which
is
nearest
to
us
namely
our
own
bodily
frame
and
crossing
the
interval
between
the
centre
and
its
vast
circumference
by
one
of
the
great
strides
of
genius
descartes
sought
to
resolve
all
the
ph√¶nomena
of
the
universe
into
matter
and
motion
or
forces
operating
according
to
law
this
grand
conception
which
is
sketched
in
the
discours
and
more
fully
developed
in
the
principes
and
in
the
trait√©
de
he
worked
out
with
extraordinary
power
and
knowledge
and
with
the
effect
of
arriving
in
the
essay
at
that
purely
mechanical
view
of
vital
ph√¶nomena
towards
which
modern
physiology
is
striving
let
us
try
to
understand
how
descartes
got
into
this
path
and
why
it
led
him
where
it
did
the
mechanism
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
had
evidently
taken
a
great
hold
of
his
mind
as
he
describes
it
several
times
at
much
length
after
giving
a
full
account
of
it
in
the
discourse
and
erroneously
describing
the
motion
of
the
blood
not
to
the
contraction
of
the
walls
of
the
heart
but
to
the
heat
which
he
supposes
to
be
generated
there
he
adds
this
motion
which
i
have
just
explained
is
as
much
the
necessary
result
of
the
structure
of
the
parts
which
one
can
see
in
the
heart
and
of
the
heat
which
one
may
feel
there
with
one
fingers
and
of
the
nature
of
the
blood
which
may
be
experimentally
ascertained
as
is
that
of
a
clock
of
the
force
the
situation
and
the
figure
of
its
weight
and
of
its
wheels
but
if
this
apparently
vital
operation
were
explicable
as
a
simple
mechanism
might
not
other
vital
operations
be
reducible
to
the
same
category
descartes
replies
without
hesitation
in
the
affirmative
the
animal
spirits
says
he
resemble
a
very
subtle
fluid
or
a
very
pure
and
vivid
flame
and
are
continually
generated
in
the
heart
and
ascend
to
the
brain
as
to
a
sort
of
reservoir
hence
they
pass
into
the
nerves
and
are
distributed
to
the
muscles
causing
contraction
or
relaxation
according
to
their
quantity
thus
according
to
descartes
the
animal
body
is
an
automaton
which
is
competent
to
perform
all
the
animal
functions
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
a
clock
or
any
other
piece
of
mechanism
as
he
puts
the
case
himself
in
proportion
as
these
spirits
the
animal
spirits
enter
the
cavities
of
the
brain
they
pass
thence
into
the
pores
of
its
substance
and
from
these
pores
into
the
nerves
where
according
as
they
enter
or
even
only
tend
to
enter
more
or
less
into
one
than
into
another
they
have
the
power
of
altering
the
figure
of
the
muscles
into
which
the
nerves
are
inserted
and
by
this
means
of
causing
all
the
limbs
to
move
thus
as
you
may
have
seen
in
the
grottoes
and
the
fountains
in
royal
gardens
the
force
with
which
the
water
issues
from
its
reservoir
is
sufficient
to
move
various
machines
and
even
to
make
them
play
instruments
or
pronounce
words
according
to
the
different
disposition
of
the
pipes
which
lead
the
water
and
in
truth
the
nerves
of
the
machine
which
i
am
describing
may
very
well
be
compared
to
the
pipes
of
these
waterworks
its
muscles
and
its
tendons
to
the
other
various
engines
and
springs
which
seem
to
move
them
its
animal
spirits
to
the
water
which
impels
them
of
which
the
heart
is
the
fountain
while
the
cavities
of
the
brain
are
the
central
office
moreover
respiration
and
other
such
actions
as
are
natural
and
usual
in
the
body
and
which
depend
on
the
course
of
the
spirits
are
like
the
movements
of
a
clock
or
of
a
mill
which
may
be
kept
up
by
the
ordinary
flow
of
the
water
the
external
objects
which
by
their
mere
presence
act
upon
the
organs
of
the
senses
and
which
by
this
means
determine
the
corporal
machine
to
move
in
many
different
ways
according
as
the
parts
of
the
brain
are
arranged
are
like
the
strangers
who
entering
into
some
of
the
grottoes
of
these
waterworks
unconsciously
cause
the
movements
which
take
place
in
their
presence
for
they
can
not
enter
without
treading
upon
certain
planks
so
arranged
that
for
example
if
they
approach
a
bathing
diana
they
cause
her
to
hide
among
the
reeds
and
if
they
attempt
to
follow
her
they
see
approaching
a
neptune
who
threatens
them
with
his
trident
or
if
they
try
some
other
way
they
cause
some
monster
who
vomits
water
into
their
faces
to
dart
out
or
like
contrivances
according
to
the
fancy
of
the
engineers
who
have
made
them
and
lastly
when
the
is
lodged
in
this
machine
it
will
have
its
principal
seat
in
the
brain
and
will
take
the
place
of
the
engineer
who
ought
to
be
in
that
part
of
the
works
with
which
all
the
pipes
are
connected
when
he
wishes
to
increase
or
to
slacken
or
in
some
way
to
alter
their
movements
and
again
still
more
strongly
all
the
functions
which
i
have
attributed
to
this
machine
the
body
as
the
digestion
of
food
the
pulsation
of
the
heart
and
of
the
arteries
the
nutrition
and
the
growth
of
the
limbs
respiration
wakefulness
and
sleep
the
reception
of
light
sounds
odours
flavours
heat
and
such
like
qualities
in
the
organs
of
the
external
senses
the
impression
of
the
ideas
of
these
in
the
organ
of
common
sense
and
in
the
imagination
the
retention
or
the
impression
of
these
ideas
on
the
memory
the
internal
movements
of
the
appetites
and
the
passions
and
lastly
the
external
movements
of
all
the
limbs
which
follow
so
aptly
as
well
the
action
of
the
objects
which
are
presented
to
the
senses
as
the
impressions
which
meet
in
the
memory
that
they
imitate
as
nearly
as
possible
those
of
a
real
man
i
desire
i
say
that
you
should
consider
that
these
functions
in
the
machine
naturally
proceed
from
the
mere
arrangement
of
its
organs
neither
more
nor
less
than
do
the
movements
of
a
clock
or
other
automaton
from
that
of
its
weights
and
its
wheels
so
that
so
far
as
these
are
concerned
it
is
not
necessary
to
conceive
any
other
vegetative
or
sensitive
soul
nor
any
other
principle
of
motion
or
of
life
than
the
blood
and
the
spirits
agitated
by
the
fire
which
burns
continually
in
the
heart
and
which
is
no
wise
essentially
different
from
all
the
fires
which
exist
in
inanimate
bodies
the
spirit
of
these
passages
is
exactly
that
of
the
most
advanced
physiology
of
the
present
day
all
that
is
necessary
to
make
them
coincide
with
our
present
physiology
in
form
is
to
represent
the
details
of
the
working
of
the
animal
machinery
in
modern
language
and
by
the
aid
of
modern
conceptions
most
undoubtedly
the
digestion
of
food
in
the
human
body
is
a
purely
chemical
process
and
the
passage
of
the
nutritive
parts
of
that
food
into
the
blood
a
physical
operation
beyond
all
question
the
circulation
of
the
blood
is
simply
a
matter
of
mechanism
and
results
from
the
structure
and
arrangement
of
the
parts
of
the
heart
and
vessels
from
the
contractility
of
those
organs
and
from
the
regulation
of
that
contractility
by
an
automatically
acting
nervous
apparatus
the
progress
of
physiology
has
further
shown
that
the
contractility
of
the
muscles
and
the
irritability
of
the
nerves
are
purely
the
results
of
the
molecular
mechanism
of
those
organs
and
that
the
regular
movements
of
the
respiratory
alimentary
and
other
internal
organs
are
governed
and
guided
as
mechanically
by
their
appropriate
nervous
centres
the
even
rhythm
of
the
breathing
of
every
one
of
us
depends
upon
the
structural
integrity
of
a
particular
region
of
the
medulla
oblongata
as
much
as
the
ticking
of
a
clock
depends
upon
the
integrity
of
the
escapement
you
may
take
away
the
hands
of
a
clock
and
break
up
its
striking
machinery
but
it
will
still
tick
and
a
man
may
be
unable
to
feel
speak
or
move
and
yet
he
will
breathe
again
in
entire
accordance
with
descartes
affirmation
it
is
certain
that
the
modes
of
motion
which
constitute
the
physical
basis
of
light
sound
and
heat
are
transmuted
into
affections
of
nervous
matter
by
the
sensory
organs
these
affections
are
so
to
speak
a
kind
of
physical
ideas
which
are
retained
in
the
central
organs
constituting
what
might
be
called
physical
memory
and
may
be
combined
in
a
manner
which
answers
to
association
and
imagination
or
may
give
rise
to
muscular
contractions
in
those
reflex
actions
which
are
the
mechanical
representatives
of
volitions
consider
what
happens
when
a
blow
is
aimed
at
the
eye
instantly
and
without
our
knowledge
or
will
and
even
against
the
will
the
eyelids
close
what
is
it
that
happens
a
picture
of
the
rapidly
advancing
fist
is
made
upon
the
retina
at
the
back
of
the
eye
the
retina
changes
this
picture
into
an
affection
of
a
number
of
the
fibres
of
the
optic
nerve
the
fibres
of
the
optic
nerve
affect
certain
parts
of
the
brain
the
brain
in
consequence
affects
those
particular
fibres
of
the
seventh
nerve
which
go
to
the
orbicular
muscle
of
the
eyelids
the
change
in
these
causes
the
muscular
fibres
to
change
their
dimensions
so
as
to
become
shorter
and
broader
and
the
result
is
the
closing
of
the
slit
between
the
two
lids
round
which
these
fibres
are
disposed
here
is
a
pure
mechanism
giving
rise
to
a
purposive
action
and
strictly
comparable
to
that
by
which
descartes
supposes
his
waterwork
diana
to
be
moved
but
we
may
go
further
and
inquire
whether
our
volition
in
what
we
term
voluntary
action
ever
plays
any
other
part
than
that
of
descartes
engineer
sitting
in
his
office
and
turning
this
tap
or
the
other
as
he
wishes
to
set
one
or
another
machine
in
motion
but
exercising
no
direct
influence
upon
the
movements
of
the
whole
our
voluntary
acts
consist
of
two
parts
firstly
we
desire
to
perform
a
certain
action
and
secondly
we
somehow
set
a
machinery
which
does
what
we
desire
but
so
little
do
we
directly
influence
that
machinery
that
of
us
do
not
even
know
its
existence
suppose
one
wills
to
raise
one
arm
and
whirl
it
round
nothing
is
easier
but
the
majority
of
us
do
not
know
that
nerves
and
muscles
are
concerned
in
this
process
and
the
best
anatomist
among
us
would
be
amazingly
perplexed
if
he
were
called
upon
to
direct
the
succession
and
the
relative
strength
of
the
multitudinous
which
are
the
actual
causes
of
this
very
simple
operation
so
again
in
speaking
how
many
of
us
know
that
the
voice
is
produced
in
the
larynx
and
modified
by
the
mouth
how
many
among
these
instructed
persons
understand
how
the
voice
is
produced
and
modified
and
what
living
man
if
he
had
unlimited
control
over
all
the
nerves
supplying
the
mouth
and
larynx
of
another
person
could
make
him
pronounce
a
sentence
yet
if
one
has
anything
to
say
what
is
easier
than
to
say
it
we
desire
the
utterance
of
certain
words
we
touch
the
spring
of
the
and
they
are
spoken
just
as
descartes
engineer
when
he
wanted
a
particular
hydraulic
machine
to
play
had
only
to
turn
a
tap
and
what
he
wished
was
done
it
is
because
the
body
is
a
machine
that
education
is
possible
education
is
the
formation
of
habits
a
superinducing
of
an
artificial
organization
upon
the
natural
organization
of
the
body
so
that
acts
which
at
first
required
a
conscious
effort
eventually
became
unconscious
and
mechanical
if
the
act
which
primarily
requires
a
distinct
consciousness
and
volition
of
its
details
always
needed
the
same
effort
education
would
be
an
impossibility
according
to
descartes
then
all
the
functions
which
are
common
to
man
and
animals
are
performed
by
the
body
as
a
mere
mechanism
and
he
looks
upon
consciousness
as
the
peculiar
distinction
of
the
of
the
rational
soul
which
in
man
and
in
man
only
in
descartes
opinion
is
superadded
to
the
body
this
rational
soul
he
conceived
to
be
lodged
in
the
pineal
gland
as
in
a
sort
of
central
office
and
here
by
the
intermediation
of
the
animal
spirits
it
became
aware
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
body
or
influenced
the
operations
of
the
body
modern
physiologists
do
not
ascribe
so
exalted
a
function
to
the
little
pineal
gland
but
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
they
adopt
descartes
principle
and
suppose
that
the
soul
is
lodged
in
the
cortical
part
of
the
brain
at
least
this
is
commonly
regarded
as
the
seat
and
instrument
of
consciousness
descartes
has
clearly
stated
what
he
conceived
to
be
the
difference
between
spirit
and
matter
matter
is
substance
which
has
extension
but
does
not
think
spirit
is
substance
which
thinks
but
has
no
extension
it
is
very
hard
to
form
a
definite
notion
of
what
this
phraseology
means
when
it
is
taken
in
connexion
with
the
location
of
the
soul
in
the
pineal
gland
and
i
can
only
represent
it
to
myself
as
signifying
that
the
soul
is
a
mathematical
point
having
place
but
not
extension
within
the
limits
of
the
pineal
gland
not
only
has
it
place
but
it
must
exert
force
for
according
to
the
hypothesis
it
is
competent
when
it
wills
to
change
the
course
of
the
animal
spirits
which
consist
of
matter
in
motion
thus
the
soul
becomes
a
centre
of
force
but
at
the
same
time
the
distinction
between
spirit
and
matter
vanishes
inasmuch
as
matter
according
to
a
tenable
hypothesis
may
be
nothing
but
a
multitude
of
centres
of
force
the
case
is
worse
if
we
adopt
the
modern
vague
notion
that
consciousness
is
seated
in
the
grey
matter
of
the
cerebrum
generally
for
as
the
grey
matter
has
extension
that
which
is
lodged
in
it
must
also
have
extension
and
thus
we
are
led
in
another
way
to
lose
spirit
in
matter
in
truth
descartes
physiology
like
the
modern
physiology
of
which
it
anticipates
the
spirit
leads
straight
to
materialism
so
far
as
that
title
is
rightly
applicable
to
the
doctrine
that
we
have
no
knowledge
of
any
thinking
substance
apart
from
extended
substance
and
that
thought
is
as
much
a
function
of
matter
as
motion
is
thus
we
arrive
at
the
singular
result
that
of
the
two
paths
opened
up
to
us
in
the
discourse
upon
method
the
one
leads
by
way
of
berkeley
and
hume
to
kant
and
idealism
while
the
other
leads
by
way
of
de
la
mettrie
and
priestley
to
modern
physiology
and
materialism
our
stem
divides
into
two
main
branches
which
grow
in
opposite
ways
and
bear
flowers
which
look
as
different
as
they
can
well
be
but
each
branch
is
sound
and
healthy
and
has
as
much
life
and
vigour
as
the
other
if
a
botanist
found
this
state
of
things
in
a
new
plant
i
imagine
that
he
might
be
inclined
to
think
that
his
tree
was
monoecious
that
the
flowers
were
of
different
sexes
and
that
so
far
from
setting
up
a
barrier
between
the
two
branches
of
the
tree
the
only
hope
of
fertility
lay
in
bringing
them
together
i
may
be
taking
too
much
of
a
naturalist
view
of
the
case
but
i
must
confess
that
this
is
exactly
my
notion
of
what
is
to
be
done
with
metaphysics
and
physics
their
differences
are
complementary
not
antagonistic
and
thought
will
never
be
completely
fruitful
until
the
one
unites
with
the
other
let
me
try
to
explain
what
i
mean
i
hold
with
the
materialist
that
the
human
body
like
all
living
bodies
is
a
machine
all
the
operations
of
which
will
sooner
or
later
be
explained
on
physical
principles
i
believe
that
we
shall
sooner
or
later
arrive
at
a
mechanical
equivalent
of
consciousness
just
as
we
have
arrived
at
a
mechanical
equivalent
of
heat
if
a
pound
weight
falling
through
a
distance
of
a
foot
gives
rise
to
a
definite
amount
of
heat
which
may
properly
be
said
to
be
its
equivalent
the
same
pound
weight
falling
through
a
foot
on
a
man
hand
gives
rise
to
a
definite
amount
of
feeling
which
might
with
equal
propriety
be
said
to
be
its
equivalent
in
consciousness
and
as
we
already
know
that
there
is
a
certain
parity
between
the
intensity
of
a
pain
and
the
strength
of
one
desire
to
get
rid
of
that
pain
and
secondly
that
there
is
a
certain
correspondence
between
the
intensity
of
the
heat
or
mechanical
violence
which
gives
rise
to
the
pain
and
the
pain
itself
the
possibility
of
the
establishment
of
a
correlation
between
mechanical
force
and
volition
becomes
apparent
and
the
same
conclusion
is
suggested
by
the
fact
that
within
certain
limits
the
intensity
of
the
mechanical
force
we
exert
is
proportioned
to
the
intensity
of
our
desire
to
exert
it
thus
i
am
prepared
to
go
with
the
materialists
wherever
the
true
pursuit
of
the
path
of
descartes
may
lead
them
and
i
am
glad
on
all
occasions
to
declare
my
belief
that
their
fearless
development
of
the
materialistic
aspect
of
these
matters
has
had
an
immense
and
a
most
beneficial
influence
upon
physiology
and
psychology
nay
more
when
they
go
farther
than
i
think
they
are
entitled
to
do
when
they
introduce
calvinism
into
science
and
declare
that
man
is
nothing
but
a
machine
i
do
not
see
any
particular
harm
in
their
doctrines
so
long
as
they
admit
that
which
is
a
matter
of
experimental
fact
namely
that
it
is
a
machine
capable
of
adjusting
itself
within
certain
limits
i
protest
that
if
some
great
power
would
agree
to
make
me
always
think
what
is
true
and
do
what
is
right
on
condition
of
being
turned
into
a
sort
of
clock
and
wound
up
every
morning
before
i
got
out
of
bed
i
should
instantly
close
with
the
offer
the
only
freedom
i
care
about
is
the
freedom
to
do
right
the
freedom
to
do
wrong
i
am
ready
to
part
with
on
the
cheapest
terms
to
any
one
who
will
take
it
of
me
but
when
the
materialists
stray
beyond
the
borders
of
their
path
and
begin
to
talk
about
there
being
nothing
else
in
the
universe
but
matter
and
force
and
necessary
laws
and
all
the
rest
of
grenadiers
i
decline
to
follow
them
i
go
back
to
the
point
from
which
we
started
and
to
the
other
path
of
descartes
i
remind
you
that
we
have
already
seen
clearly
and
distinctly
and
in
a
manner
which
admits
of
no
doubt
that
all
our
knowledge
is
a
knowledge
of
states
of
consciousness
matter
and
force
are
so
far
as
we
can
know
mere
names
for
certain
forms
of
consciousness
necessary
means
that
of
which
we
can
not
conceive
the
contrary
law
means
a
rule
which
we
have
always
found
to
hold
good
and
which
we
expect
always
will
hold
good
thus
it
is
an
indisputable
truth
that
what
we
call
the
material
world
is
only
known
to
us
under
the
forms
of
the
ideal
world
and
as
descartes
tells
us
our
knowledge
of
the
soul
is
more
intimate
and
certain
than
our
knowledge
of
the
body
if
i
say
that
impenetrability
is
a
property
of
matter
all
that
i
can
really
mean
is
that
the
consciousness
i
call
extension
and
the
consciousness
i
call
resistance
constantly
accompany
one
another
why
and
how
they
are
thus
related
is
a
mystery
and
if
i
say
that
thought
is
a
property
of
matter
all
that
i
can
mean
is
that
actually
or
possibly
the
consciousness
of
extension
and
that
of
resistance
accompany
all
other
sorts
of
consciousness
but
as
in
the
former
case
why
they
are
thus
associated
is
an
insoluble
mystery
from
all
this
it
follows
that
what
i
may
term
legitimate
materialism
that
is
the
extension
of
the
conceptions
and
of
the
methods
of
physical
science
to
the
highest
as
well
as
the
lowest
phenomena
of
vitality
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
sort
of
shorthand
idealism
and
two
paths
meet
at
the
summit
of
the
mountain
though
they
set
out
on
opposite
sides
of
it
the
reconciliation
of
physics
and
metaphysics
lies
in
the
acknowledgment
of
faults
upon
both
sides
in
the
confession
by
physics
that
all
the
ph√¶nomena
of
nature
are
in
their
ultimate
analysis
known
to
us
only
as
facts
of
consciousness
in
the
admission
by
metaphysics
that
the
facts
of
consciousness
are
practically
interpretable
only
by
the
methods
and
the
formul√¶
of
physics
and
finally
in
the
observance
by
both
metaphysical
and
physical
thinkers
of
descartes
maxim
assent
to
no
proposition
the
matter
of
which
is
not
so
clear
and
distinct
that
it
can
not
be
doubted
when
you
did
me
the
honour
to
ask
me
to
deliver
this
address
i
confess
i
was
perplexed
what
topic
to
select
for
you
are
emphatically
and
distinctly
a
body
while
science
and
philosophy
within
the
range
of
which
lie
all
the
topics
on
which
i
could
venture
to
speak
are
neither
christian
nor
unchristian
but
are
extrachristian
and
have
a
world
of
their
own
which
to
use
language
which
will
be
very
familiar
to
your
ears
just
now
is
not
only
unsectarian
but
is
altogether
secular
the
arguments
which
i
have
put
before
you
for
example
are
not
inconsistent
so
far
as
i
know
with
any
form
of
theology
after
much
consideration
i
thought
that
i
might
be
most
useful
to
you
if
i
attempted
to
give
you
some
vision
of
this
extrachristian
world
as
it
appears
to
a
person
who
lives
a
good
deal
in
it
and
if
i
tried
to
show
you
by
what
methods
the
dwellers
therein
try
to
distinguish
truth
from
falsehood
in
regard
to
some
of
the
deepest
and
most
difficult
problems
that
beset
humanity
in
order
to
be
clear
about
their
actions
and
to
walk
surefootedly
in
this
life
as
descartes
says
it
struck
me
that
if
the
execution
of
my
project
came
anywhere
near
the
conception
of
it
you
would
become
aware
that
the
philosophers
and
the
men
of
science
are
not
exactly
what
they
are
sometimes
represented
to
you
to
be
and
that
their
methods
and
paths
do
not
lead
so
perpendicularly
downwards
as
you
are
occasionally
told
they
do
and
i
must
admit
also
that
a
particular
and
personal
motive
weighed
with
me
namely
the
desire
to
show
that
a
certain
discourse
which
brought
a
great
storm
about
my
head
some
time
ago
contained
nothing
but
the
ultimate
development
of
the
views
of
the
father
of
modern
philosophy
i
do
not
know
if
i
have
been
quite
wise
in
allowing
this
last
motive
to
weigh
with
me
they
say
that
the
most
dangerous
thing
one
can
do
in
a
thunderstorm
is
to
shelter
oneself
under
a
great
tree
and
the
history
of
descartes
life
shows
how
narrowly
he
escaped
being
riven
by
the
lightnings
which
were
more
destructive
in
his
time
than
in
ours
descartes
lived
and
died
a
good
catholic
and
prided
himself
upon
having
demonstrated
the
existence
of
god
and
of
the
soul
of
man
as
a
reward
for
his
exertions
his
old
friends
the
jesuits
put
his
works
upon
the
index
and
called
him
an
atheist
while
the
protestant
divines
of
holland
declared
him
to
be
both
a
jesuit
and
an
atheist
his
books
narrowly
escaped
being
burned
by
the
hangman
the
fate
of
vanini
was
dangled
before
his
eyes
and
the
misfortunes
of
galileo
so
alarmed
him
that
he
renounced
the
pursuits
by
which
the
world
has
so
greatly
benefited
and
was
driven
into
subterfuges
and
evasions
which
were
not
worthy
of
him
very
cowardly
you
may
say
and
so
it
was
but
you
must
make
allowance
for
the
fact
that
in
the
seventeenth
century
not
only
did
heresy
mean
possible
burning
or
imprisonment
but
the
very
suspicion
of
it
destroyed
a
man
peace
and
rendered
the
calm
pursuit
of
truth
difficult
or
impossible
i
fancy
that
descartes
was
a
man
to
care
more
about
being
worried
and
disturbed
than
about
being
burned
outright
and
like
many
other
men
sacrificed
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
quietness
what
he
would
have
stubbornly
maintained
against
downright
violence
however
this
may
be
let
those
who
are
sure
they
would
have
done
better
throw
stones
at
him
i
have
no
feelings
but
those
of
gratitude
and
reverence
for
the
man
who
did
what
he
did
when
he
did
and
a
sort
of
shame
that
any
one
should
repine
against
taking
a
fair
share
of
such
treatment
as
the
world
thought
good
enough
for
him
finally
it
occurs
to
me
that
such
being
my
feeling
about
the
matter
it
may
be
useful
to
all
of
us
if
i
ask
you
what
is
yours
do
you
think
that
the
christianity
of
the
seventeenth
century
looks
nobler
and
more
attractive
for
such
treatment
of
such
a
man
you
will
hardly
reply
that
it
does
but
if
it
does
not
may
it
not
be
well
if
all
of
you
do
what
lies
within
your
power
to
prevent
the
christianity
of
the
nineteenth
century
from
repeating
the
scandal
there
are
one
or
two
living
men
who
a
couple
of
centuries
hence
will
be
remembered
as
descartes
is
now
because
they
have
produced
great
thoughts
which
will
live
and
grow
as
long
as
mankind
lasts
if
the
century
studies
their
history
it
will
find
that
the
christianity
of
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
recognised
them
only
as
objects
of
vilification
it
is
for
you
and
such
as
you
christian
young
men
to
say
whether
this
shall
be
as
true
of
the
christianity
of
the
future
as
it
is
of
that
of
the
present
i
appeal
to
you
to
say
no
in
your
own
interest
and
in
that
of
the
christianity
you
profess
in
the
interest
of
science
no
appeal
is
needful
as
