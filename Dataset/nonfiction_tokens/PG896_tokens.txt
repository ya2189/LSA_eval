the
jubilee
of
the
constitution
delivered
at
new
york
april
before
the
new
york
historical
society
and
brethren
associates
of
the
new
york
historical
society
would
it
be
an
unlicensed
trespass
of
the
imagination
to
conceive
that
on
the
night
preceding
the
day
of
which
you
now
commemorate
the
fiftieth
anniversary
on
the
night
preceding
that
thirtieth
of
april
when
from
the
balcony
of
your
city
hall
the
chancellor
of
the
state
of
new
york
administered
to
george
washington
the
solemn
oath
faithfully
to
execute
the
office
of
president
of
the
united
states
and
to
the
best
of
his
ability
to
preserve
protect
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
in
the
visions
of
the
night
the
guardian
angel
of
the
father
of
our
country
had
appeared
before
him
in
the
venerated
form
of
his
mother
and
to
cheer
and
encourage
him
in
the
performance
of
the
momentous
and
solemn
duties
that
he
was
about
to
assume
had
delivered
to
him
a
suit
of
celestial
armor
a
helmet
consisting
of
the
principles
of
piety
of
justice
of
honor
of
benevolence
with
which
from
his
earliest
infancy
he
had
hitherto
walked
through
life
in
the
presence
of
all
his
brethren
a
spear
studded
with
the
truths
of
the
declaration
of
independence
a
sword
the
same
with
which
he
had
led
the
armies
of
his
country
through
the
war
of
freedom
to
the
summit
of
the
triumphal
arch
of
independence
a
corselet
and
cuishes
of
long
experience
and
habitual
intercourse
in
peace
and
war
with
the
world
of
mankind
his
contemporaries
of
the
human
race
in
all
their
stages
of
civilization
and
last
of
all
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
a
shield
embossed
by
heavenly
hands
with
the
future
history
of
his
country
yes
gentlemen
on
that
shield
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
sculptured
by
forms
unseen
and
in
characters
then
invisible
to
mortal
eye
the
predestined
and
prophetic
history
of
the
one
confederated
people
of
the
north
american
union
they
had
been
the
settlers
of
thirteen
separate
and
distinct
english
colonies
along
the
margin
of
the
shore
of
the
north
american
continent
contiguously
situated
but
chartered
by
adventurers
of
characters
variously
diversified
including
sectarians
religious
and
political
of
all
the
classes
which
for
the
two
preceding
centuries
had
agitated
and
divided
the
people
of
the
british
islands
and
with
them
were
intermingled
the
descendants
of
hollanders
swedes
germans
and
french
fugitives
from
the
persecution
of
the
revoker
of
the
edict
of
nantes
in
the
bosoms
of
this
people
thus
heterogeneously
composed
there
was
burning
kindled
at
different
furnaces
but
all
furnaces
of
affliction
one
clear
steady
flame
of
liberty
bold
and
daring
enterprise
stubborn
endurance
of
privation
unflinching
intrepidity
in
facing
danger
and
inflexible
adherence
to
conscientious
principle
had
steeled
to
energetic
and
unyielding
hardihood
the
characters
of
the
primitive
settlers
of
all
these
colonies
since
that
time
two
or
three
generations
of
men
had
passed
away
but
they
had
increased
and
multiplied
with
unexampled
rapidity
and
the
land
itself
had
been
the
recent
theatre
of
a
ferocious
and
bloody
seven
years
war
between
the
two
most
powerful
and
most
civilized
nations
of
europe
contending
for
the
possession
of
this
continent
of
that
strife
the
victorious
combatant
had
been
britain
she
had
conquered
the
provinces
of
france
she
had
expelled
her
rival
totally
from
the
continent
over
which
bounding
herself
by
the
mississippi
she
was
thenceforth
to
hold
divided
empire
only
with
spain
she
had
acquired
undisputed
control
over
the
indian
tribes
still
tenanting
the
forests
unexplored
by
the
european
man
she
had
established
an
uncontested
monopoly
of
the
commerce
of
all
her
colonies
but
forgetting
all
the
warnings
of
preceding
ages
forgetting
the
lessons
written
in
the
blood
of
her
own
children
through
centuries
of
departed
time
she
undertook
to
tax
the
people
of
the
colonies
without
their
consent
resistance
instantaneous
unconcerted
sympathetic
inflexible
resistance
like
an
electric
shock
startled
and
roused
the
people
of
all
the
english
colonies
on
this
continent
this
was
the
first
signal
of
the
north
american
union
the
struggle
was
for
chartered
rights
for
english
liberties
for
the
cause
of
algernon
sidney
and
john
hampden
for
trial
by
jury
the
habeas
corpus
and
magna
charta
but
the
english
lawyers
had
decided
that
parliament
was
omnipotent
and
parliament
in
its
omnipotence
instead
of
trial
by
jury
and
the
habeas
corpus
enacted
admiralty
courts
in
england
to
try
americans
for
offences
charged
against
them
as
committed
in
america
instead
of
the
privileges
of
magna
charta
nullified
the
charter
itself
of
massachusetts
bay
shut
up
the
port
of
boston
sent
armies
and
navies
to
keep
the
peace
and
teach
the
colonies
that
john
hampden
was
a
rebel
and
algernon
sidney
a
traitor
english
liberties
had
failed
them
from
the
omnipotence
of
parliament
the
colonists
appealed
to
the
rights
of
man
and
the
omnipotence
of
the
god
of
battles
union
union
was
the
instinctive
and
simultaneous
cry
throughout
the
land
their
congress
assembled
at
philadelphia
once
twice
had
petitioned
the
king
had
remonstrated
to
parliament
had
addressed
the
people
of
britain
for
the
rights
of
englishmen
in
vain
fleets
and
armies
the
blood
of
lexington
and
the
fires
of
charlestown
and
falmouth
had
been
the
answer
to
petition
remonstrance
and
address
the
dissolution
of
allegiance
to
the
british
crown
the
severance
of
the
colonies
from
the
british
empire
and
their
actual
existence
as
independent
states
were
definitively
established
in
fact
by
war
and
peace
the
independence
of
each
separate
state
had
never
been
declared
of
right
it
never
existed
in
fact
upon
the
principles
of
the
declaration
of
independence
the
dissolution
of
the
ties
of
allegiance
the
assumption
of
sovereign
power
and
the
institution
of
civil
government
are
all
acts
of
transcendent
authority
which
the
people
alone
are
competent
to
perform
and
accordingly
it
is
in
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
the
people
that
two
of
these
acts
the
dissolution
of
allegiance
with
the
severance
from
the
british
empire
and
the
declaration
of
the
united
colonies
as
free
and
independent
states
were
performed
by
that
instrument
but
there
still
remained
the
last
and
crowning
act
which
the
people
of
the
union
alone
were
competent
to
perform
the
institution
of
civil
government
for
that
compound
nation
the
united
states
of
america
at
this
day
it
can
not
but
strike
us
as
extraordinary
that
it
does
not
appear
to
have
occurred
to
any
one
member
of
that
assembly
which
had
laid
down
in
terms
so
clear
so
explicit
so
unequivocal
the
foundation
of
all
just
government
in
the
imprescriptible
rights
of
man
and
the
transcendent
sovereignty
of
the
people
and
who
in
those
principles
had
set
forth
their
only
personal
vindication
from
the
charges
of
rebellion
against
their
king
and
of
treason
to
their
country
that
their
last
crowning
act
was
still
to
be
performed
upon
the
same
principles
that
is
the
institution
by
the
people
of
the
united
states
of
a
civil
government
to
guard
and
protect
and
defend
them
all
on
the
contrary
that
same
assembly
which
issued
the
declaration
of
independence
instead
of
continuing
to
act
in
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
the
good
people
of
the
united
states
had
immediately
after
the
appointment
of
the
committee
to
prepare
the
declaration
appointed
another
committee
of
one
member
from
each
colony
to
prepare
and
digest
the
form
of
confederation
to
be
entered
into
between
the
colonies
that
committee
reported
on
the
twelfth
of
july
eight
days
after
the
declaration
of
independence
had
been
issued
a
draft
of
articles
of
confederation
between
the
colonies
this
draft
was
prepared
by
john
dickinson
then
a
delegate
from
pennsylvania
who
voted
against
the
declaration
of
independence
and
never
signed
it
having
been
superseded
by
a
new
election
of
delegates
from
that
state
eight
days
after
his
draft
was
reported
there
was
thus
no
congeniality
of
principle
between
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
articles
of
confederation
the
foundation
of
the
former
was
a
superintending
providence
the
rights
of
man
and
the
constituent
revolutionary
power
of
the
people
that
of
the
latter
was
the
sovereignty
of
organized
power
and
the
independence
of
the
separate
or
states
the
fabric
of
the
declaration
and
that
of
the
confederation
were
each
consistent
with
its
own
foundation
but
they
could
not
form
one
consistent
symmetrical
edifice
they
were
the
productions
of
different
minds
and
of
adverse
passions
one
ascending
for
the
foundation
of
human
government
to
the
laws
of
nature
and
of
god
written
upon
the
heart
of
man
the
other
resting
upon
the
basis
of
human
institutions
and
prescriptive
law
and
colonial
charter
the
cornerstone
of
the
one
was
right
that
of
the
other
was
power
where
then
did
each
state
get
the
sovereignty
freedom
and
independence
which
the
articles
of
confederation
declare
it
retains
not
from
the
whole
people
of
the
whole
union
not
from
the
declaration
of
independence
not
from
the
people
of
the
state
itself
it
was
assumed
by
agreement
between
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
and
their
delegates
in
congress
without
authority
from
or
consultation
of
the
people
at
all
in
the
declaration
of
independence
the
enacting
and
constituent
party
dispensing
and
delegating
sovereign
power
is
the
whole
people
of
the
united
colonies
the
recipient
party
invested
with
power
is
the
united
colonies
declared
united
states
in
the
articles
of
confederation
this
order
of
agency
is
inverted
each
state
is
the
constituent
and
enacting
party
and
the
united
states
in
congress
assembled
the
recipient
of
delegated
power
and
that
power
delegated
with
such
a
penurious
and
carking
hand
that
it
had
more
the
aspect
of
a
revocation
of
the
declaration
of
independence
than
an
instrument
to
carry
it
into
effect
none
of
these
indispensably
necessary
powers
were
ever
conferred
by
the
state
legislatures
upon
the
congress
of
the
federation
and
well
was
it
that
they
never
were
the
system
itself
was
radically
defective
its
incurable
disease
was
an
apostasy
from
the
principles
of
the
declaration
of
independence
a
substitution
of
separate
state
sovereignties
in
the
place
of
the
constituent
sovereignty
of
the
people
was
the
basis
of
the
confederate
union
in
the
congress
of
the
confederation
the
master
minds
of
james
madison
and
alexander
hamilton
were
constantly
engaged
through
the
closing
years
of
the
revolutionary
war
and
those
of
peace
which
immediately
succeeded
that
of
john
jay
was
associated
with
them
shortly
after
the
peace
in
the
capacity
of
secretary
to
the
congress
for
foreign
affairs
the
incompetency
of
the
articles
of
confederation
for
the
management
of
the
affairs
of
the
union
at
home
and
abroad
was
demonstrated
to
them
by
the
painful
and
mortifying
experience
of
every
day
washington
though
in
retirement
was
brooding
over
the
cruel
injustice
suffered
by
his
associates
in
arms
the
warriors
of
the
revolution
over
the
prostration
of
the
public
credit
and
the
faith
of
the
nation
in
the
neglect
to
provide
for
the
payments
even
of
the
interest
upon
the
public
debt
over
the
disappointed
hopes
of
the
friends
of
freedom
in
the
language
of
the
address
from
congress
to
the
states
of
the
eighteenth
of
april
the
pride
and
boast
of
america
that
the
rights
for
which
she
contended
were
the
rights
of
human
nature
at
his
residence
at
mount
vernon
in
march
the
first
idea
was
started
of
a
revisal
of
the
articles
of
confederation
by
the
organization
of
means
differing
from
that
of
a
compact
between
the
state
legislatures
and
their
own
delegates
in
congress
a
convention
of
delegates
from
the
state
legislatures
independent
of
the
congress
itself
was
the
expedient
which
presented
itself
for
effecting
the
purpose
and
an
augmentation
of
the
powers
of
congress
for
the
regulation
of
commerce
as
the
object
for
which
this
assembly
was
to
be
convened
in
january
the
proposal
was
made
and
adopted
in
the
legislature
of
virginia
and
communicated
to
the
other
state
legislatures
the
convention
was
held
at
annapolis
in
september
of
that
year
it
was
attended
by
delegates
from
only
five
of
the
central
states
who
on
comparing
their
restricted
powers
with
the
glaring
and
universally
acknowledged
defects
of
the
confederation
reported
only
a
recommendation
for
the
assemblage
of
another
convention
of
delegates
to
meet
at
philadelphia
in
may
from
all
the
states
and
with
enlarged
powers
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
the
work
of
this
convention
but
in
its
construction
the
convention
immediately
perceived
that
they
must
retrace
their
steps
and
fall
back
from
a
league
of
friendship
between
sovereign
states
to
the
constituent
sovereignty
of
the
people
from
power
to
right
from
the
irresponsible
despotism
of
state
sovereignty
to
the
truths
of
the
declaration
of
independence
in
that
instrument
the
right
to
institute
and
to
alter
governments
among
men
was
ascribed
exclusively
to
the
people
the
ends
of
government
were
declared
to
be
to
secure
the
natural
rights
of
man
and
that
when
the
government
degenerates
from
the
promotion
to
the
destruction
of
that
end
the
right
and
the
duty
accrues
to
the
people
to
dissolve
this
degenerate
government
and
to
institute
another
the
signers
of
the
declaration
further
averred
that
the
one
people
of
the
united
colonies
were
then
precisely
in
that
situation
with
a
government
degenerated
into
tyranny
and
called
upon
by
the
laws
of
nature
and
of
nature
god
to
dissolve
that
government
and
to
institute
another
then
in
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
the
good
people
of
the
colonies
they
pronounced
the
dissolution
of
their
allegiance
to
the
king
and
their
eternal
separation
from
the
nation
of
great
britain
and
declared
the
united
colonies
independent
states
and
here
as
the
representatives
of
the
one
people
they
had
stopped
they
did
not
require
the
confirmation
of
this
act
for
the
power
to
make
the
declaration
had
already
been
conferred
upon
them
by
the
people
delegating
the
power
indeed
separately
in
the
separate
colonies
not
by
colonial
authority
but
by
the
spontaneous
revolutionary
movement
of
the
people
in
them
all
from
the
day
of
that
declaration
the
constituent
power
of
the
people
had
never
been
called
into
action
a
confederacy
had
been
substituted
in
the
place
of
a
government
and
state
sovereignty
had
usurped
the
constituent
sovereignty
of
the
people
the
convention
assembled
at
philadelphia
had
themselves
no
direct
authority
from
the
people
their
authority
was
all
derived
from
the
state
legislatures
but
they
had
the
articles
of
confederation
before
them
and
they
saw
and
felt
the
wretched
condition
into
which
they
had
brought
the
whole
people
and
that
the
union
itself
was
in
the
agonies
of
death
they
soon
perceived
that
the
indispensably
needed
powers
were
such
as
no
state
government
no
combination
of
them
was
by
the
principles
of
the
declaration
of
independence
competent
to
bestow
they
could
emanate
only
from
the
people
a
highly
respectable
portion
of
the
assembly
still
clinging
to
the
confederacy
of
states
proposed
as
a
substitute
for
the
constitution
a
mere
revival
of
the
articles
of
confederation
with
a
grant
of
additional
powers
to
the
congress
their
plan
was
respectfully
and
thoroughly
discussed
but
the
want
of
a
government
and
of
the
sanction
of
the
people
to
the
delegation
of
powers
happily
prevailed
a
constitution
for
the
people
and
the
distribution
of
legislative
executive
and
judicial
powers
was
prepared
it
announced
itself
as
the
work
of
the
people
themselves
and
as
this
was
unquestionably
a
power
assumed
by
the
convention
not
delegated
to
them
by
the
people
they
religiously
confined
it
to
a
simple
power
to
propose
and
carefully
provided
that
it
should
be
no
more
than
a
proposal
until
sanctioned
by
the
confederation
congress
by
the
state
legislatures
and
by
the
people
of
the
several
states
in
conventions
specially
assembled
by
authority
of
their
legislatures
for
the
single
purpose
of
examining
and
passing
upon
it
and
thus
was
consummated
the
work
commenced
by
the
declaration
of
independence
a
work
in
which
the
people
of
the
north
american
union
acting
under
the
deepest
sense
of
responsibility
to
the
supreme
ruler
of
the
universe
had
achieved
the
most
transcendent
act
of
power
that
social
man
in
his
mortal
condition
can
perform
even
that
of
dissolving
the
ties
of
allegiance
by
which
he
is
bound
to
his
country
of
renouncing
that
country
itself
of
demolishing
its
government
of
instituting
another
government
and
of
making
for
himself
another
country
in
its
stead
and
on
that
day
of
which
you
now
commemorate
the
fiftieth
anniversary
on
that
thirtieth
day
of
april
was
this
mighty
revolution
not
only
in
the
affairs
of
our
own
country
but
in
the
principles
of
government
over
civilized
man
accomplished
the
revolution
itself
was
a
work
of
thirteen
years
and
had
never
been
completed
until
that
day
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
are
parts
of
one
consistent
whole
founded
upon
one
and
the
same
theory
of
government
then
new
in
practice
though
not
as
a
theory
for
it
had
been
working
itself
into
the
mind
of
man
for
many
ages
and
had
been
especially
expounded
in
the
writings
of
locke
though
it
had
never
before
been
adopted
by
a
great
nation
in
practice
there
are
yet
even
at
this
day
many
speculative
objections
to
this
theory
even
in
our
own
country
there
are
still
philosophers
who
deny
the
principles
asserted
in
the
declaration
as
truths
who
deny
the
natural
equality
and
inalienable
rights
of
man
who
deny
that
the
people
are
the
only
legitimate
source
of
power
who
deny
that
all
just
powers
of
government
are
derived
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
neither
your
time
nor
perhaps
the
cheerful
nature
of
this
occasion
permit
me
here
to
enter
upon
the
examination
of
this
theory
which
arrays
state
sovereignty
against
the
constituent
sovereignty
of
the
people
and
distorts
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
into
a
league
of
friendship

confederate

speak
to

of

there
is
the
declaration
of
independence
and
there
is
the
constitution
of
the
united

let
them
speak
for
themselves
the
grossly
immoral
and
dishonest
doctrine
of
despotic
state
sovereignty
the
exclusive
judge
of
its
own
obligations

no

the
violation
of
them

think
of
your

and
of
your

the
romans
themselves
at
the
pinnacle
of
civilization
were
actuated
by
the

impressions
and
celebrated
in
anniversary
festivals
every
great
event
which
had
signalized
the
annals
of

to
multiply
instances
where
it
were
impossible

the

in
the
luxuriance
of
youth
and
in
the
vigor
of
manhood
it
is
pleasing
and
instructive
to
look
backward
upon
the
helpless
days
of
infancy
but
in
the
continual
and
essential
changes
of
a
growing
subject
the
transactions
of
that
early
period
would
be
soon
obliterated
from
the
memory
but
for
some
periodical
call
of
attention
to
aid
the
silent
records
of
the
historian
such
celebrations
arouse
and
gratify
the
kindliest
emotions
of
the
bosom
they
are
faithful
pledges
of
the
respect
we
bear
to
the
memory
of
our
ancestors
and
of
the
tenderness
with
which
we
cherish
the
rising
generation

introduce
the
sages

heroes
of
ages
past
to
the
notice

they
are
at
once
testimonials
of
our
gratitude

of
virtue
to
our

solemnity

intrinsic
importance

of
more
extensive
consequences
was
ever
selected
for
this
honorary
distinction
in
reverting
to
the
period
of
our
origin
other
nations
have
generally
been
compelled
to
plunge
into
the
chaos
of
impenetrable
antiquity
or
to
trace
a
lawless
ancestry
into
the
caverns
of
ravishers
and
robbers
it
is
your
peculiar
privilege
to
commemorate
in
this
birthday
of
your
nation
an
event
ascertained
in
its
minutest
details
an
event
of
which
the
principal
actors
are
known
to
you
familiarly
as
if
belonging
to
your
own
age
an
event
of
a
magnitude
before
which
imagination
shrinks
at
the
imperfection
of
her
powers
it
is
your
further
happiness
to
behold
in
those
eminent
characters
who
were
most
conspicuous
in
accomplishing
the
settlement
of
your
country
men
upon
whose
virtue
you
can
dwell
with
honest
exultation
the
founders
of
your
race
are
not
handed
down
to
you
like
the
fathers
of
the
roman
people
as
the
sucklings
of
a
wolf
you
are
not
descended
from
a
nauseous
compound
of
fanaticism
and
sensuality
whose
only
argument
was
the
sword
and
whose
only
paradise
was
a
brothel
no
gothic
scourge
of
god
no
vandal
pest
of
nations
no
fabled
fugitive
from
the
flames
of
troy
no
bastard
norman
tyrant
appears
among
the
list
of
worthies
who
first
landed
on
the
rock
which
your
veneration
has
preserved
as
a
lasting
monument
of
their
achievement
the
great
actors
of
the
day
we
now
solemnize
were
illustrious
by
their
intrepid
valor
no
less
than
by
their
christian
graces
but
the
clarion
of
conquest
has
not
blazoned
forth
their
names
to
all
the
winds
of
heaven
their
glory
has
not
been
wafted
over
oceans
of
blood
to
the
remotest
regions
of
the
earth
they
have
not
erected
to
themselves
colossal
statues
upon
pedestals
of
human
bones
to
provoke
and
insult
the
tardy
hand
of
heavenly
retribution
but
theirs
was
the
better
fortitude
of
patience
and
heroic
martyrdom
theirs
was
the
gentle
temper
of
christian
kindness
the
rigorous
observance
of
reciprocal
justice
the
unconquerable
soul
of
conscious
integrity
worldly
fame
has
been
parsimonious
of
her
favor
to
the
memory
of
those
generous
companions
their
numbers
were
small
their
stations
in
life
obscure
the
object
of
their
enterprise
unostentatious
the
theatre
of
their
exploits
remote
how
could
they
possibly
be
favorites
of
worldly
fame
that
common
crier
whose
existence
is
only
known
by
the
assemblage
of
multitudes
that
pander
of
wealth
and
greatness
so
eager
to
haunt
the
palaces
of
fortune
and
so
fastidious
to
the
houseless
dignity
of
virtue
that
parasite
of
pride
ever
scornful
to
meekness
and
ever
obsequious
to
insolent
power
that
heedless
trumpeter
whose
ears
are
deaf
to
modest
merit
and
whose
eyes
are
blind
to
bloodless
distant
excellence
when
the
persecuted
companions
of
robinson
exiles
from
their
native
land
anxiously
sued
for
the
privilege
of
removing
a
thousand
leagues
more
distant
to
an
untried
soil
a
rigorous
climate
and
a
savage
wilderness
for
the
sake
of
reconciling
their
sense
of
religious
duty
with
their
affections
for
their
country
few
perhaps
none
of
them
formed
a
conception
of
what
would
be
within
two
centuries
the
result
of
their
undertaking
when
the
jealous
and
niggardly
policy
of
their
british
sovereign
denied
them
even
that
humblest
of
requests
and
instead
of
liberty
would
barely
consent
to
promise
connivance
neither
he
nor
they
might
be
aware
that
they
were
laying
the
foundations
of
a
power
and
that
he
was
sowing
the
seeds
of
a
spirit
which
in
less
than
two
hundred
years
would
stagger
the
throne
of
his
descendants
and
shake
his
united
kingdoms
to
the
centre
so
far
is
it
from
the
ordinary
habits
of
mankind
to
calculate
the
importance
of
events
in
their
elementary
principles
that
had
the
first
colonists
of
our
country
ever
intimated
as
a
part
of
their
designs
the
project
of
founding
a
great
and
mighty
nation
the
finger
of
scorn
would
have
pointed
them
to
the
cells
of
bedlam
as
an
abode
more
suitable
for
hatching
vain
empires
than
the
solitude
of
a
transatlantic
desert
these
consequences
then
so
little
foreseen
have
unfolded
themselves
in
all
their
grandeur
to
the
eyes
of
the
present
age
it
is
a
common
amusement
of
speculative
minds
to
contrast
the
magnitude
of
the
most
important
events
with
the
minuteness
of
their
primeval
causes
and
the
records
of
mankind
are
full
of
examples
for
such
contemplations
it
is
however
a
more
profitable
employment
to
trace
the
constituent
principles
of
future
greatness
in
their
kernel
to
detect
in
the
acorn
at
our
feet
the
germ
of
that
majestic
oak
whose
roots
shoot
down
to
the
centre
and
whose
branches
aspire
to
the
skies
let
it
be
then
our
present
occupation
to
inquire
and
endeavor
to
ascertain
the
causes
first
put
in
operation
at
the
period
of
our
commemoration
and
already
productive
of
such
magnificent
effects
to
examine
with
reiterated
care
and
minute
attention
the
characters
of
those
men
who
gave
the
first
impulse
to
a
new
series
of
events
in
the
history
of
the
world
to
applaud
and
emulate
those
qualities
of
their
minds
which
we
shall
find
deserving
of
our
admiration
to
recognize
with
candor
those
features
which
forbid
approbation
or
even
require
censure
and
finally
to
lay
alike
their
frailties
and
their
perfections
to
our
own
hearts
either
as
warning
or
as
example
of
the
various
european
settlements
upon
this
continent
which
have
finally
merged
in
one
independent
nation
the
first
establishments
were
made
at
various
times
by
several
nations
and
under
the
influence
of
different
motives
in
many
instances
the
conviction
of
religious
obligation
formed
one
and
a
powerful
inducement
of
the
adventures
but
in
none
excepting
the
settlement
at
plymouth
did
they
constitute
the
sole
and
exclusive
actuating
cause
worldly
interest
and
commercial
speculation
entered
largely
into
the
views
of
other
settlers
but
the
commands
of
conscience
were
the
only
stimulus
to
the
emigrants
from
leyden
previous
to
their
expedition
hither
they
had
endured
a
long
banishment
from
their
native
country
under
every
species
of
discouragement
they
undertook
the
voyage
they
performed
it
in
spite
of
numerous
and
almost
insuperable
obstacles
they
arrived
upon
a
wilderness
bound
with
frost
and
hoary
with
snow
without
the
boundaries
of
their
charter
outcasts
from
all
human
society
and
coasted
five
weeks
together
in
the
dead
of
winter
on
this
tempestuous
shore
exposed
at
once
to
the
fury
of
the
elements
to
the
arrows
of
the
native
savage
and
to
the
impending
horrors
of
famine
courage
and
perseverance
have
a
magical
talisman
before
which
difficulties
disappear
and
obstacles
vanish
into
air
these
qualities
have
ever
been
displayed
in
their
mightiest
perfection
as
attendants
in
the
retinue
of
strong
passions
from
the
first
discovery
of
the
western
hemisphere
by
columbus
until
the
settlement
of
virginia
which
immediately
preceded
that
of
plymouth
the
various
adventurers
from
the
ancient
world
had
exhibited
upon
innumerable
occasions
that
ardor
of
enterprise
and
that
stubbornness
of
pursuit
which
set
all
danger
at
defiance
and
chained
the
violence
of
nature
at
their
feet
but
they
were
all
instigated
by
personal
interests
avarice
and
ambition
had
tuned
their
souls
to
that
pitch
of
exaltation
selfish
passions
were
the
parents
of
their
heroism
it
was
reserved
for
the
first
settlers
of
new
england
to
perform
achievements
equally
arduous
to
trample
down
obstructions
equally
formidable
to
dispel
dangers
equally
terrific
under
the
single
inspiration
of
conscience
to
them
even
liberty
herself
was
but
a
subordinate
and
secondary
consideration
they
claimed
exemption
from
the
mandates
of
human
authority
as
militating
with
their
subjection
to
a
superior
power
before
the
voice
of
heaven
they
silenced
even
the
calls
of
their
country
yet
while
so
deeply
impressed
with
the
sense
of
religious
obligation
they
felt
in
all
its
energy
the
force
of
that
tender
tie
which
binds
the
heart
of
every
virtuous
man
to
his
native
land
it
was
to
renew
that
connection
with
their
country
which
had
been
severed
by
their
compulsory
expatriation
that
they
resolved
to
face
all
the
hazards
of
a
perilous
navigation
and
all
the
labors
of
a
toilsome
distant
settlement
under
the
mild
protection
of
the
batavian
government
they
enjoyed
already
that
freedom
of
religious
worship
for
which
they
had
resigned
so
many
comforts
and
enjoyments
at
home
but
their
hearts
panted
for
a
restoration
to
the
bosom
of
their
country
invited
and
urged
by
the
and
truly
benevolent
people
who
had
given
them
an
asylum
from
the
persecution
of
their
own
kindred
to
form
their
settlement
within
the
territories
then
under
their
jurisdiction
the
love
of
their
country
predominated
over
every
influence
save
that
of
conscience
alone
and
they
preferred
the
precarious
chance
of
relaxation
from
the
bigoted
rigor
of
the
english
government
to
the
certain
liberality
and
alluring
offers
of
the
hollanders
observe
my
countrymen
the
generous
patriotism
the
cordial
union
of
soul
the
conscious
yet
unaffected
vigor
which
beam
in
their
application
to
the
british
monarch
they
were
well
weaned
from
the
delicate
milk
of
their
mother
country
and
inured
to
the
difficulties
of
a
strange
land
they
were
knit
together
in
a
strict
and
sacred
bond
to
take
care
of
the
good
of
each
other
and
of
the
whole
it
was
not
with
them
as
with
other
men
whom
small
things
could
discourage
or
small
discontents
cause
to
wish
themselves
again
at
home
children
of
these
exalted
pilgrims
is
there
one
among
you
who
can
hear
the
simple
and
pathetic
energy
of
these
expressions
without
tenderness
and
admiration
venerated
shades
of
our
forefathers
no
ye
were
indeed
not
ordinary
men
that
country
which
had
ejected
you
so
cruelly
from
her
bosom
you
still
delighted
to
contemplate
in
the
character
of
an
affectionate
and
beloved
mother
the
sacred
bond
which
knit
you
together
was
indissoluble
while
you
lived
and
oh
may
it
be
to
your
descendants
the
example
and
the
pledge
of
harmony
to
the
latest
period
of
time
the
difficulties
and
dangers
which
so
often
had
defeated
attempts
of
similar
establishments
were
unable
to
subdue
souls
tempered
like
yours
you
heard
the
rigid
interdictions
you
saw
the
menacing
forms
of
toil
and
danger
forbidding
your
access
to
this
land
of
promise
but
you
heard
without
dismay
you
saw
and
disdained
retreat
firm
and
undaunted
in
the
confidence
of
that
sacred
bond
conscious
of
the
purity
and
convinced
of
the
importance
of
your
motives
you
put
your
trust
in
the
protecting
shield
of
providence
and
smiled
defiance
at
the
combining
terrors
of
human
malice
and
of
elemental
strife
these
in
the
accomplishment
of
your
undertaking
you
were
summoned
to
encounter
in
their
most
hideous
forms
these
you
met
with
that
fortitude
and
combated
with
that
perseverance
which
you
had
promised
in
their
anticipation
these
you
completely
vanquished
in
establishing
the
foundations
of
new
england
and
the
day
which
we
now
commemorate
is
the
perpetual
memorial
of
your
triumph
it
were
an
occupation
peculiarly
pleasing
to
cull
from
our
early
historians
and
exhibit
before
you
every
detail
of
this
transaction
to
carry
you
in
imagination
on
board
their
bark
at
the
first
moment
of
her
arrival
in
the
bay
to
accompany
carver
winslow
bradford
and
standish
in
all
their
excursions
upon
the
desolate
coast
to
follow
them
into
every
rivulet
and
creek
where
they
endeavored
to
find
a
firm
footing
and
to
fix
with
a
pause
of
delight
and
exultation
the
instant
when
the
first
of
these
heroic
adventurers
alighted
on
the
spot
where
you
their
descendants
now
enjoy
the
glorious
and
happy
reward
of
their
labors
but
in
this
grateful
task
your
former
orators
on
this
anniversary
have
anticipated
all
that
the
most
ardent
industry
could
collect
and
gratified
all
that
the
most
inquisitive
curiosity
could
desire
to
you
my
friends
every
occurrence
of
that
momentous
period
is
already
familiar
a
transient
allusion
to
a
few
characteristic
instances
which
mark
the
peculiar
history
of
the
plymouth
settlers
may
properly
supply
the
place
of
a
narrative
which
to
this
auditory
must
be
superfluous
one
of
these
remarkable
incidents
is
the
execution
of
that
instrument
of
government
by
which
they
formed
themselves
into
a
body
politic
the
day
after
their
arrival
upon
the
coast
and
previous
to
their
first
landing
that
is
perhaps
the
only
instance
in
human
history
of
that
positive
original
social
compact
which
speculative
philosophers
have
imagined
as
the
only
legitimate
source
of
government
here
was
a
unanimous
and
personal
assent
by
all
the
individuals
of
the
community
to
the
association
by
which
they
became
a
nation
it
was
the
result
of
circumstances
and
discussions
which
had
occurred
during
their
passage
from
europe
and
is
a
full
demonstration
that
the
nature
of
civil
government
abstracted
from
the
political
institutions
of
their
native
country
had
been
an
object
of
their
serious
meditation
the
settlers
of
all
the
former
european
colonies
had
contented
themselves
with
the
powers
conferred
upon
them
by
their
respective
charters
without
looking
beyond
the
seal
of
the
royal
parchment
for
the
measure
of
their
rights
and
the
rule
of
their
duties
the
founders
of
plymouth
had
been
impelled
by
the
peculiarities
of
their
situation
to
examine
the
subject
with
deeper
and
more
comprehensive
research
after
twelve
years
of
banishment
from
the
land
of
their
first
allegiance
during
which
they
had
been
under
an
adoptive
and
temporary
subjection
to
another
sovereign
they
must
naturally
have
been
led
to
reflect
upon
the
relative
rights
and
duties
of
allegiance
and
subjection
they
had
resided
in
a
city
the
seat
of
a
university
where
the
polemical
and
political
controversies
of
the
time
were
pursued
with
uncommon
fervor
in
this
period
they
had
witnessed
the
deadly
struggle
between
the
two
parties
into
which
the
people
of
the
united
provinces
after
their
separation
from
the
crown
of
spain
had
divided
themselves
the
contest
embraced
within
its
compass
not
only
theological
doctrines
but
political
principles
and
maurice
and
barnevelt
were
the
temporal
leaders
of
the
same
rival
factions
of
which
episcopius
and
polyander
were
the
ecclesiastical
champions
that
the
investigation
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
government
was
deeply
implicated
in
these
dissensions
is
evident
from
the
immortal
work
of
grotius
upon
the
rights
of
war
and
peace
which
undoubtedly
originated
from
them
grotius
himself
had
been
a
most
distinguished
actor
and
sufferer
in
those
important
scenes
of
internal
convulsion
and
his
work
was
first
published
very
shortly
after
the
departure
of
our
forefathers
from
leyden
it
is
well
known
that
in
the
course
of
the
contest
robinson
more
than
once
appeared
with
credit
to
himself
as
a
public
disputant
against
episcopius
and
from
the
manner
in
which
the
fact
is
related
by
governor
bradford
it
is
apparent
that
the
whole
english
church
at
leyden
took
a
zealous
interest
in
the
religious
part
of
the
controversy
as
strangers
in
the
land
it
is
presumable
that
they
wisely
and
honorably
avoided
entangling
themselves
in
the
political
contentions
involved
with
it
yet
the
theoretic
principles
as
they
were
drawn
into
discussion
could
not
fail
to
arrest
their
attention
and
must
have
assisted
them
to
form
accurate
ideas
concerning
the
origin
and
extent
of
authority
among
men
independent
of
positive
institutions
the
importance
of
these
circumstances
will
not
be
duly
weighed
without
taking
into
consideration
the
state
of
opinion
then
prevalent
in
england
the
general
principles
of
government
were
there
little
understood
and
less
examined
the
whole
substance
of
human
authority
was
centred
in
the
simple
doctrine
of
royal
prerogative
the
origin
of
which
was
always
traced
in
theory
to
divine
institution
twenty
years
later
the
subject
was
more
industriously
sifted
and
for
half
a
century
became
one
of
the
principal
topics
of
controversy
between
the
ablest
and
most
enlightened
men
in
the
nation
the
instrument
of
voluntary
association
executed
on
board
the
mayflower
testifies
that
the
parties
to
it
had
anticipated
the
improvement
of
their
nation
another
incident
from
which
we
may
derive
occasion
for
important
reflections
was
the
attempt
of
these
original
settlers
to
establish
among
them
that
community
of
goods
and
of
labor
which
fanciful
politicians
from
the
days
of
plato
to
those
of
rousseau
have
recommended
as
the
fundamental
law
of
a
perfect
republic
this
theory
results
it
must
be
acknowledged
from
principles
of
reasoning
most
flattering
to
the
human
character
if
industry
frugality
and
disinterested
integrity
were
alike
the
virtues
of
all
there
would
apparently
be
more
of
the
social
spirit
in
making
all
property
a
common
stock
and
giving
to
each
individual
a
proportional
title
to
the
wealth
of
the
whole
such
is
the
basis
upon
which
plato
forbids
in
his
republic
the
division
of
property
such
is
the
system
upon
which
rousseau
pronounces
the
first
man
who
inclosed
a
field
with
a
fence
and
said
this
is
mine
a
traitor
to
the
human
species
a
wiser
and
more
useful
philosophy
however
directs
us
to
consider
man
according
to
the
nature
in
which
he
was
formed
subject
to
infirmities
which
no
wisdom
can
remedy
to
weaknesses
which
no
institution
can
strengthen
to
vices
which
no
legislation
can
correct
hence
it
becomes
obvious
that
separate
property
is
the
natural
and
indisputable
right
of
separate
exertion
that
community
of
goods
without
community
of
toil
is
oppressive
and
unjust
that
it
counteracts
the
laws
of
nature
which
prescribe
that
he
only
who
sows
the
seed
shall
reap
the
harvest
that
it
discourages
all
energy
by
destroying
its
rewards
and
makes
the
most
virtuous
and
active
members
of
society
the
slaves
and
drudges
of
the
worst
such
was
the
issue
of
this
experiment
among
our
forefathers
and
the
same
event
demonstrated
the
error
of
the
system
in
the
elder
settlement
of
virginia
let
us
cherish
that
spirit
of
harmony
which
prompted
our
forefathers
to
make
the
attempt
under
circumstances
more
favorable
to
its
success
than
perhaps
ever
occurred
upon
earth
let
us
no
less
admire
the
candor
with
which
they
relinquished
it
upon
discovering
its
irremediable
inefficacy
to
found
principles
of
government
upon
too
advantageous
an
estimate
of
the
human
character
is
an
error
of
inexperience
the
source
of
which
is
so
amiable
that
it
is
impossible
to
censure
it
with
severity
we
have
seen
the
same
mistake
committed
in
our
own
age
and
upon
a
larger
theatre
happily
for
our
ancestors
their
situation
allowed
them
to
repair
it
before
its
effects
had
proved
destructive
they
had
no
pride
of
vain
philosophy
to
support
no
perfidious
rage
of
faction
to
glut
by
persevering
in
their
mistakes
until
they
should
be
extinguished
in
torrents
of
blood
as
the
attempt
to
establish
among
themselves
the
community
of
goods
was
a
seal
of
that
sacred
bond
which
knit
them
so
closely
together
so
the
conduct
they
observed
toward
the
natives
of
the
country
displays
their
steadfast
adherence
to
the
rules
of
justice
and
their
faithful
attachment
to
those
of
benevolence
and
charity
no
european
settlement
ever
formed
upon
this
continent
has
been
more
distinguished
for
undeviating
kindness
and
equity
toward
the
savages
there
are
indeed
moralists
who
have
questioned
the
right
of
the
europeans
to
intrude
upon
the
possessions
of
the
aboriginals
in
any
case
and
under
any
limitations
whatsoever
but
have
they
maturely
considered
the
whole
subject
the
indian
right
of
possession
itself
stands
with
regard
to
the
greater
part
of
the
country
upon
a
questionable
foundation
their
cultivated
fields
their
constructed
habitations
a
space
of
ample
sufficiency
for
their
subsistence
and
whatever
they
had
annexed
to
themselves
by
personal
labor
was
undoubtedly
by
the
laws
of
nature
theirs
but
what
is
the
right
of
a
huntsman
to
the
forest
of
a
thousand
miles
over
which
he
has
accidentally
ranged
in
quest
of
prey
shall
the
liberal
bounties
of
providence
to
the
race
of
man
be
monopolized
by
one
of
ten
thousand
for
whom
they
were
created
shall
the
exuberant
bosom
of
the
common
mother
amply
adequate
to
the
nourishment
of
millions
be
claimed
exclusively
by
a
few
hundreds
of
her
offspring
shall
the
lordly
savage
not
only
disdain
the
virtues
and
enjoyments
of
civilization
himself
but
shall
he
control
the
civilization
of
a
world
shall
he
forbid
the
wilderness
to
blossom
like
a
rose
shall
he
forbid
the
oaks
of
the
forest
to
fall
before
the
axe
of
industry
and
to
rise
again
transformed
into
the
habitations
of
ease
and
elegance
shall
he
doom
an
immense
region
of
the
globe
to
perpetual
desolation
and
to
hear
the
howlings
of
the
tiger
and
the
wolf
silence
forever
the
voice
of
human
gladness
shall
the
fields
and
the
valleys
which
a
beneficent
god
has
formed
to
teem
with
the
life
of
innumerable
multitudes
be
condemned
to
everlasting
barrenness
shall
the
mighty
rivers
poured
out
by
the
hand
of
nature
as
channels
of
communication
between
numerous
nations
roll
their
waters
in
sullen
silence
and
eternal
solitude
of
the
deep
have
hundreds
of
commodious
harbors
a
thousand
leagues
of
coast
and
a
boundless
ocean
been
spread
in
the
front
of
this
land
and
shall
every
purpose
of
utility
to
which
they
could
apply
be
prohibited
by
the
tenant
of
the
woods
no
generous
philanthropists
heaven
has
not
been
thus
inconsistent
in
the
works
of
its
hands
heaven
has
not
thus
placed
at
irreconcilable
strife
its
moral
laws
with
its
physical
creation
the
pilgrims
of
plymouth
obtained
their
right
of
possession
to
the
territory
on
which
they
settled
by
titles
as
fair
and
unequivocal
as
any
human
property
can
be
held
by
their
voluntary
association
they
recognized
their
allegiance
to
the
government
of
britain
and
in
process
of
time
received
whatever
powers
and
authorities
could
be
conferred
upon
them
by
a
charter
from
their
sovereign
the
spot
on
which
they
fixed
had
belonged
to
an
indian
tribe
totally
extirpated
by
that
devouring
pestilence
which
had
swept
the
country
shortly
before
their
arrival
the
territory
thus
free
from
all
exclusive
possession
they
might
have
taken
by
the
natural
right
of
occupancy
desirous
however
of
giving
amply
satisfaction
to
every
pretence
of
prior
right
by
formal
and
solemn
conventions
with
the
chiefs
of
the
neighboring
tribes
they
acquired
the
further
security
of
a
purchase
at
their
hands
the
children
of
the
desert
had
no
cause
of
complaint
on
the
great
day
of
retribution
what
thousands
what
millions
of
the
american
race
will
appear
at
the
bar
of
judgment
to
arraign
their
european
invading
conquerors
let
us
humbly
hope
that
the
fathers
of
the
plymouth
colony
will
then
appear
in
the
whiteness
of
innocence
let
us
indulge
in
the
belief
that
they
will
not
only
be
free
from
all
accusation
of
injustice
to
these
unfortunate
sons
of
nature
but
that
the
testimonials
of
their
acts
of
kindness
and
benevolence
toward
them
will
plead
the
cause
of
their
virtues
as
they
are
now
authenticated
by
the
record
of
history
upon
earth
religious
discord
has
lost
her
sting
the
cumbrous
weapons
of
theological
warfare
are
antiquated
the
field
of
politics
supplies
the
alchemists
of
our
times
with
materials
of
more
fatal
explosion
and
the
butchers
of
mankind
no
longer
travel
to
another
world
for
instruments
of
cruelty
and
destruction
our
age
is
too
enlightened
to
contend
upon
topics
which
concern
only
the
interests
of
eternity
the
men
who
hold
in
proper
contempt
all
controversies
about
trifles
except
such
as
inflame
their
own
passions
have
made
it
a
commonplace
censure
against
your
ancestors
that
their
zeal
was
enkindled
by
subjects
of
trivial
importance
and
that
however
aggrieved
by
the
intolerance
of
others
they
were
alike
intolerant
themselves
against
these
objections
your
candid
judgment
will
not
require
an
unqualified
justification
but
your
respect
and
gratitude
for
the
founders
of
the
state
may
boldly
claim
an
ample
apology
the
original
grounds
of
their
separation
from
the
church
of
england
were
not
objects
of
a
magnitude
to
dissolve
the
bonds
of
communion
much
less
those
of
charity
between
christian
brethren
of
the
same
essential
principles
some
of
them
however
were
not
inconsiderable
and
numerous
inducements
concurred
to
give
them
an
extraordinary
interest
in
their
eyes
when
that
portentous
system
of
abuses
the
papal
dominion
was
overturned
a
great
variety
of
religious
sects
arose
in
its
stead
in
the
several
countries
which
for
many
centuries
before
had
been
screwed
beneath
its
subjection
the
fabric
of
the
reformation
first
undertaken
in
england
upon
a
contracted
basis
by
a
capricious
and
sanguinary
tyrant
had
been
successively
overthrown
and
restored
renewed
and
altered
according
to
the
varying
humors
and
principles
of
four
successive
monarchs
to
ascertain
the
precise
point
of
division
between
the
genuine
institutions
of
christianity
and
the
corruptions
accumulated
upon
them
in
the
progress
of
fifteen
centuries
was
found
a
task
of
extreme
difficulty
throughout
the
christian
world
men
of
the
profoundest
learning
of
the
sublimest
genius
and
of
the
purest
integrity
after
devoting
their
lives
to
the
research
finally
differed
in
their
ideas
upon
many
great
points
both
of
doctrine
and
discipline
the
main
question
it
was
admitted
on
all
hands
most
intimately
concerned
the
highest
interests
of
man
both
temporal
and
eternal
can
we
wonder
that
men
who
felt
their
happiness
here
and
their
hopes
of
hereafter
their
worldly
welfare
and
the
kingdom
of
heaven
at
stake
should
sometimes
attach
an
importance
beyond
their
intrinsic
weight
to
collateral
points
of
controversy
connected
with
the
object
of
the
reformation
the
changes
in
the
forms
and
principles
of
religious
worship
were
introduced
and
regulated
in
england
by
the
hand
of
public
authority
but
that
hand
had
not
been
uniform
or
steady
in
its
operations
during
the
persecutions
inflicted
in
the
interval
of
popish
restoration
under
the
reign
of
mary
upon
all
who
favored
the
reformation
many
of
the
most
zealous
reformers
had
been
compelled
to
fly
their
country
while
residing
on
the
continent
of
europe
they
had
adopted
the
principles
of
the
most
complete
and
rigorous
reformation
as
taught
and
established
by
calvin
on
returning
afterward
to
their
native
country
they
were
dissatisfied
with
the
partial
reformation
at
which
as
they
conceived
the
english
establishment
had
rested
and
claiming
the
privilege
of
private
conscience
upon
which
alone
any
departure
from
the
church
of
rome
could
be
justified
they
insisted
upon
the
right
of
adhering
to
the
system
of
their
own
preference
and
of
course
upon
that
of
to
the
establishment
prescribed
by
the
royal
authority
the
only
means
used
to
convince
them
of
error
and
reclaim
them
from
dissent
was
force
and
force
served
but
to
confirm
the
opposition
it
was
meant
to
suppress
by
driving
the
founders
of
the
plymouth
colony
into
exile
it
constrained
them
to
absolute
separation
irreconcilable
viewing
their
religious
liberties
here
as
held
only
by
sufferance
yet
bound
to
them
by
all
the
ties
of
conviction
and
by
all
their
sufferings
for
them
could
they
forbear
to
look
upon
every
dissenter
among
themselves
with
a
jealous
eye
within
two
years
after
their
landing
they
beheld
a
rival
settlement
attempted
in
their
immediate
neighborhood
and
not
long
after
the
laws
of
compelled
them
to
break
up
a
nest
of
revellers
who
boasted
of
protection
from
the
mother
country
and
who
had
recurred
to
the
easy
but
pernicious
resource
of
feeding
their
wanton
idleness
by
furnishing
the
savages
with
the
means
the
skill
and
the
instruments
of
european
destruction
toleration
in
that
instance
would
have
been
and
many
other
examples
might
be
alleged
in
which
their
necessary
measures
of
have
been
exaggerated
into
cruelty
and
their
most
indispensable
precautions
distorted
into
persecution
yet
shall
we
not
pretend
that
they
were
exempt
from
the
common
laws
of
mortality
or
entirely
free
from
all
the
errors
of
their
age
their
zeal
might
sometimes
be
too
ardent
but
it
was
always
sincere
at
this
day
religious
indulgence
is
one
of
our
clearest
duties
because
it
is
one
of
our
undisputed
rights
while
we
rejoice
that
the
principles
of
genuine
christianity
have
so
far
triumphed
over
the
prejudices
of
a
former
generation
let
us
fervently
hope
for
the
day
when
it
will
prove
equally
victorious
over
the
malignant
passions
of
our
own
in
thus
calling
your
attention
to
some
of
the
peculiar
features
in
the
principles
the
character
and
the
history
of
our
forefathers
it
is
as
wide
from
my
design
as
i
know
it
would
be
from
your
approbation
to
adorn
their
memory
with
a
chaplet
plucked
from
the
domain
of
others
the
occasion
and
the
day
are
more
peculiarly
devoted
to
them
and
let
it
never
be
dishonored
with
a
contracted
and
exclusive
spirit
our
affections
as
citizens
embrace
the
whole
extent
of
the
union
and
the
names
of
raleigh
smith
winthrop
calvert
penn
and
oglethorpe
excite
in
our
minds
recollections
equally
pleasing
and
gratitude
equally
fervent
with
those
of
carver
and
bradford
two
centuries
have
not
yet
elapsed
since
the
first
european
foot
touched
the
soil
which
now
constitutes
the
american
union
two
centuries
more
and
our
numbers
must
exceed
those
of
europe
itself
the
destinies
of
their
empire
as
they
appear
in
prospect
before
us
disdain
the
powers
of
human
calculation
yet
as
the
original
founder
of
the
roman
state
is
said
once
to
have
lifted
upon
his
shoulders
the
fame
and
fortunes
of
all
his
posterity
so
let
us
never
forget
that
the
glory
and
greatness
of
all
our
descendants
is
in
our
hands
preserve
in
all
their
purity
refine
if
possible
from
all
their
alloy
those
virtues
which
we
this
day
commemorate
as
the
ornament
of
our
forefathers
adhere
to
them
with
inflexible
resolution
as
to
the
horns
of
the
altar
instil
them
with
unwearied
perseverance
into
the
minds
of
your
children
bind
your
souls
and
theirs
to
the
national
union
as
the
chords
of
life
are
centred
in
the
heart
and
you
shall
soar
with
rapid
and
steady
wing
to
the
summit
of
human
glory
nearly
a
century
ago
one
of
those
rare
minds
to
whom
it
is
given
to
discern
future
greatness
in
its
seminal
principles
upon
contemplating
the
situation
of
this
continent
pronounced
in
a
vein
of
poetic
inspiration
westward
the
star
of
empire
takes
its
way
let
us
unite
in
ardent
supplication
to
the
founder
of
nations
and
the
builder
of
worlds
that
what
then
was
prophecy
may
continue
unfolding
into
history
that
the
dearest
hopes
of
the
human
race
may
not
be
extinguished
in
disappointment
and
that
the
last
may
prove
the
noblest
empire
of
time
