preface
the
mother
of
a
little
deaf
child
once
wrote
as
follows
as
a
mother
of
a
deaf
child
and
one
whose
experience
has
been
unusual
only
in
that
it
has
been
more
fortunate
than
that
of
the
average
mother
so
situated
i
want
to
place
before
you
the
teachers
of
the
deaf
a
plea
for
the
education
of
the
parents
of
little
deaf
children
while
you
are
laboring
for
the
education
of
the
deaf
and
for
their
sakes
are
training
teachers
to
carry
on
the
work
there
are
in
almost
every
home
that
shelters
a
little
deaf
child
blunders
being
made
that
will
retard
his
development
and
hinder
your
work
for
years
to
come
blunders
that
a
little
timely
advice
might
prevent
we
parents
are
not
willfully
ignorant
not
always
stupidly
so
but
that
we
are
in
most
cases
densely
so
there
can
be
no
doubt
can
you
for
the
moment
put
yourselves
into
our
place
suppose
you
are
just
the
ordinary
american
parents
perhaps
living
far
from
the
center
of
things
you
know
in
a
hazy
way
that
there
are
deaf
and
blind
and
other
afflicted
people
perhaps
you
have
seen
some
of
them
now
into
your
home
comes
disease
or
a
sudden
awakening
to
the
meaning
of
existing
conditions
and
you
find
that
child
is
at
first
your
thought
is
of
physicians
they
fail
you
advice
from
friends
and
advertisements
from
quacks
pour
in
upon
you
still
you
find
no
comfort
and
no
help
you
stop
talking
to
the
child
what
is
the
use
he
can
not
hear
you
you
pity
him
oh
infinitely
and
your
pity
takes
the
form
of
indulgence
you
love
him
and
you
long
to
understand
him
but
you
can
not
interpret
him
and
he
feels
the
change
the
helplessness
in
your
attitude
toward
him
you
try
one
thing
after
another
floundering
desperately
in
your
effort
to
discover
what
radical
step
must
be
taken
to
meet
this
emergency
after
a
time
you
seize
upon
the
idea
that
seems
to
you
the
best
probably
it
is
to
wait
until
he
is
six
or
seven
and
then
put
him
into
an
institution
but
while
you
wait
for
school
age
to
arrive
you
lose
that
close
touch
with
the
soul
of
your
child
which
may
be
established
only
in
these
early
years
for
you
have
no
adequate
means
of
communication
with
him
no
way
to
win
his
confidence
soon
the
child
has
passed
this
stage
and
no
school
can
ever
give
him
what
you
might
and
would
have
given
had
you
known
how
you
who
are
trained
teachers
of
the
deaf
can
hardly
realize
the
need
of
advice
about
matters
perfectly
obvious
to
you
but
the
need
exists
may
i
tell
you
from
my
own
experience
a
few
of
the
things
about
which
you
might
advise
you
who
know
in
the
first
place
suggest
to
parents
that
they
make
simple
tests
of
their
children
hearing
and
tell
them
how
and
why
those
who
are
deaf
should
be
helped
then
tell
them
to
talk
and
talk
and
talk
to
their
little
deaf
ones
to
say
everything
and
say
it
naturally
and
tell
them
some
things
in
particular
that
should
be
said
commands
and
love
you
tell
them
to
speak
in
whole
sentences
give
them
an
idea
of
the
possibilities
of
tell
them
that
the
expression
of
the
they
may
convey
to
the
deaf
child
the
interest
approval
disapproval
that
they
would
express
to
a
hearing
child
in
the
tone
of
voice
tell
them
that
there
is
an
untrained
person
who
can
meddle
with
articulation
tell
them
that
it
is
not
true
that
all
deaf
children
are
bad
that
the
deaf
must
learn
obedience
as
others
do
tell
them
the
many
things
which
you
wish
your
pupils
had
learned
before
they
entered
school
only
this
i
beg
of
you
tell
them
lucile
m
moore
for
the
sake
of
presenting
the
ideas
contained
in
this
little
book
in
a
somewhat
systematic
manner
it
was
best
to
arrange
them
on
the
supposition
that
they
would
come
to
the
notice
of
the
mothers
while
their
children
were
yet
less
than
two
years
of
age
in
many
cases
however
this
will
not
be
the
case
when
therefore
the
child
is
three
four
or
five
years
old
when
this
falls
into
the
hands
of
the
mother
it
would
still
be
well
if
she
carried
out
the
suggestions
in
the
order
in
which
they
are
here
arranged
with
the
maturity
of
mind
and
body
that
comes
with
the
added
years
the
child
can
pass
through
the
earlier
stages
of
the
training
much
more
rapidly
than
can
be
the
case
with
the
baby
nevertheless
the
preliminary
steps
should
not
be
omitted
a
child
of
four
can
be
carried
in
six
months
through
the
exercises
that
occupied
two
years
when
begun
with
the
child
of
twelve
months
but
the
older
child
should
not
be
started
with
exercises
suggested
for
the
years
after
two
mothers
of
deaf
children
can
not
be
expected
to
be
trained
teachers
of
the
deaf
it
would
be
useless
and
in
fact
often
unfortunate
to
ask
them
to
attempt
to
teach
articulation
to
their
children
even
for
them
to
teach
the
children
to
write
would
usually
be
undesirable
because
the
greatest
gain
from
the
mother
efforts
comes
from
the
early
establishment
of
the
habit
and
dependence
upon
it
it
is
a
very
great
help
to
have
this
habit
fixed
before
writing
is
taught
there
is
no
haste
about
the
child
learning
to
write
that
is
easily
and
quickly
accomplished
when
the
proper
time
comes
the
difficult
thing
to
do
is
very
fortunately
the
thing
the
mother
is
best
fitted
to
accomplish
namely
to
create
in
the
child
the
ability
to
interpret
speech
by
means
of
the
eye
and
the
habit
of
expecting
to
get
ideas
by
watching
the
face
of
a
speaker
with
these
ideas
in
mind
there
has
been
careful
avoidance
in
this
little
book
of
any
suggestion
that
the
mother
should
be
anxious
about
the
speech
development
of
the
child
before
five
years
of
age
if
she
has
the
patience
and
the
time
to
follow
the
directions
given
she
will
have
done
her
child
a
very
great
service
the
greatest
that
lies
within
her
power
and
she
will
have
laid
the
foundation
for
a
more
rapid
and
better
development
of
speech
than
would
have
been
possible
without
her
preliminary
training
not
every
mother
will
find
it
possible
to
carry
out
all
the
suggestions
offered
in
this
little
book
but
no
one
should
feel
discouraged
on
that
account
it
seemed
best
to
offer
too
many
suggestions
rather
than
too
few
because
these
pages
may
fall
into
the
hands
of
some
mothers
whose
situation
is
such
that
full
advantage
can
be
taken
of
every
idea
here
given
presence
of
too
much
matter
in
the
little
book
will
not
destroy
its
usefulness
in
cases
where
only
a
portion
can
be
applied
whereas
the
lack
of
some
of
the
ideas
might
limit
its
value
in
certain
instances
no
one
should
give
up
in
despair
just
because
it
is
not
possible
to
do
all
that
is
here
suggested
something
at
least
can
be
found
here
which
it
is
possible
to
do
that
will
help
very
much
sometimes
through
a
false
sense
of
shame
or
through
ignorance
of
the
possibilities
open
to
a
deaf
child
mothers
have
refused
to
admit
that
their
children
were
deaf
or
to
allow
anything
to
be
done
for
them
until
very
valuable
time
has
been
lost
this
is
unfair
to
the
child
and
very
wrong
a
mother
should
have
only
pity
for
the
deaf
child
and
eagerness
to
aid
him
to
overcome
his
handicap
so
far
as
possible
delay
in
frankly
facing
the
facts
and
in
taking
all
possible
measures
to
develop
the
remaining
faculties
will
in
the
end
only
increase
the
mother
shame
and
add
to
it
the
pangs
of
remorse
in
a
little
book
written
to
guide
physicians
in
advising
parents
of
deaf
children
i
said
the
situation
of
a
deaf
child
differs
very
much
from
an
educational
standpoint
from
that
of
the
little
hearing
child
two
hours
a
day
playing
educational
games
in
a
kindergarten
is
as
much
as
is
usually
given
or
is
needful
for
the
little
hearing
child
up
to
six
or
seven
years
of
age
and
his
mental
development
and
success
in
after
life
will
not
be
seriously
endangered
if
even
that
is
omitted
and
he
does
not
begin
to
go
to
school
until
he
is
eight
or
nine
the
hearing
child
of
eight
who
has
never
been
in
school
and
can
not
read
or
write
has
nevertheless
without
conscious
effort
mastered
the
two
most
important
educational
tasks
in
life
he
has
learned
to
speak
and
has
acquired
the
greater
part
of
his
working
vocabulary
in
other
words
although
he
has
never
been
across
the
threshold
of
a
school
his
education
is
well
advanced
for
his
years
and
mental
development
the
situation
of
the
uninstructed
deaf
child
of
eight
is
very
different
the
task
which
it
has
taken
the
hearing
child
eight
years
to
accomplish
the
deaf
child
of
eight
has
not
even
begun
he
can
not
speak
a
word
he
does
not
even
know
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
word
he
is
eight
years
behind
his
hearing
brother
and
even
if
he
starts
now
unless
some
means
can
be
found
for
aiding
him
to
overtake
his
brother
educationally
he
will
be
only
eight
years
old
in
education
when
he
is
sixteen
years
of
age
and
when
he
is
sixteen
the
psychological
period
will
have
passed
for
acquiring
what
he
should
have
learned
when
he
was
eight
the
fact
that
the
child
is
deaf
does
not
exempt
him
from
the
inexorable
laws
of
mental
psychology
and
heredity
in
the
development
of
the
human
mind
there
is
a
certain
period
when
all
conditions
are
favorable
for
the
acquisition
of
speech
and
language
unnumbered
generations
of
ancestors
acquired
speech
and
language
at
that
stage
of
their
mental
development
and
this
little
deaf
descendant
mind
obeys
the
law
of
inherited
tendencies
if
the
speech
and
period
from
two
years
of
age
to
ten
is
allowed
to
pass
unimproved
the
task
of
learning
them
later
is
rendered
unnecessarily
difficult
therefore
in
the
case
of
the
little
deaf
child
the
years
from
two
to
ten
are
crucial
and
of
far
greater
importance
than
the
same
period
in
the
case
of
the
hearing
child
even
though
the
child
be
totally
deaf
from
birth
he
can
nevertheless
be
taught
to
speak
and
to
understand
when
others
speak
to
him
he
can
be
given
the
same
education
that
he
would
be
capable
of
mastering
if
he
could
hear
the
mother
need
not
be
despairing
nor
a
prompt
brave
and
intelligent
facing
of
the
situation
will
result
in
making
the
child
one
to
be
proud
of
and
to
lean
upon
john
wright
mount
morris
park
west
new
york
city
february
what
the
mother
of
a
deaf
child
ought
to
know
are
strongly
advised
to
read
the
i
facing
the
facts
while
deafness
is
a
serious
misfortune
it
is
neither
a
sin
nor
a
disgrace
to
be
ashamed
of
it
is
a
handicap
to
be
sure
but
one
to
be
bravely
and
cheerfully
faced
for
it
does
not
destroy
the
chances
for
happiness
and
success
it
is
cause
for
neither
discouragement
nor
despair
it
will
demand
patient
devotion
and
courageous
effort
to
overcome
the
disadvantage
but
what
mother
is
not
willing
to
show
these
in
large
measure
for
her
child
when
the
future
holds
assurance
of
comfort
and
usefulness
the
earlier
that
the
facts
are
known
and
squarely
faced
the
better
it
is
always
wiser
in
life
to
prepare
for
the
worst
and
gratefully
accept
the
best
than
to
refuse
to
acknowledge
the
possibility
of
the
worst
until
it
is
too
late
to
remedy
it
or
at
least
to
reduce
it
to
its
lowest
terms
when
a
mother
first
suspects
that
her
child
hearing
is
not
perfectly
normal
what
should
she
do
of
course
first
of
all
the
best
available
ear
specialist
should
be
consulted
at
once
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
cause
can
be
removed
and
normal
hearing
restored
sometimes
however
the
specialists
are
uncertain
of
the
outcome
and
sometimes
their
hopes
are
not
realized
in
the
meantime
precious
days
and
weeks
are
passing
in
which
something
could
be
done
for
the
little
one
educationally
without
in
any
way
interfering
with
the
medical
efforts
at
relief
the
two
things
can
be
and
should
be
carried
on
simultaneously
if
normal
hearing
is
restored
no
harm
has
been
done
by
the
educational
training
in
fact
the
development
of
the
child
has
been
advanced
on
the
other
hand
if
the
hopes
that
were
entertained
are
disappointed
then
precious
and
irrecoverable
time
has
not
been
lost
the
title
presupposes
that
the
mother
has
already
accepted
the
fact
that
her
child
hearing
is
not
perfect
and
for
the
sake
of
the
child
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
this
knowledge
came
to
her
very
promptly
after
the
occurrence
of
the
deafness
one
would
naturally
expect
a
mother
of
her
own
accord
to
carefully
test
all
the
senses
of
her
child
by
many
simple
and
repeated
exercises
during
the
first
few
months
of
its
life
the
many
cases
however
in
which
deafness
on
the
part
of
a
child
has
not
been
recognized
or
at
least
not
acknowledged
by
the
mother
till
the
third
fourth
or
even
fifth
year
show
a
strange
neglect
of
a
highly
desirable
investigation
and
a
natural
unwillingness
to
accept
a
truth
the
possibility
of
which
must
certainly
have
occurred
to
her
long
before
if
she
could
only
realize
that
she
need
not
feel
downcast
and
by
reason
of
her
little
one
imperfect
hearing
if
she
could
only
know
that
she
need
not
look
forward
to
a
life
for
him
different
from
that
of
other
children
if
she
could
understand
that
training
and
education
can
enable
him
to
overcome
to
an
extraordinary
degree
the
disadvantage
of
deafness
she
would
set
about
the
task
with
cheerfulness
and
hope
and
if
she
knew
that
the
sooner
she
began
the
better
it
would
be
for
the
little
one
she
would
not
stubbornly
refuse
for
so
long
to
acknowledge
even
the
possibility
of
deafness
ii
how
shall
the
mother
begin
her
part
of
the
work
first
of
all
something
like
an
inventory
should
be
taken
of
the
faculties
possessed
by
the
child
which
he
can
use
in
working
out
his
problem
has
he
good
sight
normal
smell
taste
muscular
sense
and
memory
to
what
extent
is
his
hearing
impaired
is
there
any
possibility
of
restoring
it
to
normal
acuteness
or
of
improving
it
or
of
preventing
any
further
impairment
the
completeness
with
which
these
questions
can
be
answered
depends
to
a
considerable
extent
on
his
age
and
his
physical
condition
we
will
suppose
that
he
is
about
fifteen
months
old
and
in
good
bodily
condition
if
he
is
older
the
same
tests
would
be
used
to
begin
with
though
we
could
at
once
pass
on
to
more
complicated
and
difficult
ones
that
can
not
as
yet
be
used
with
the
baby
first
with
regard
to
sight
we
wish
to
know
if
he
can
distinguish
reasonably
small
objects
at
reasonable
distances
whether
he
can
see
moderately
small
things
at
short
distances
whether
the
angle
of
his
vision
is
normal
in
other
words
whether
his
range
and
angle
of
vision
are
sufficient
for
all
ordinary
purposes
if
he
can
recognize
his
father
or
mother
or
brothers
and
sisters
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
feet
he
can
see
far
enough
for
all
practical
purposes
if
he
readily
finds
a
small
object
like
a
pin
or
a
small
black
bead
when
dropped
on
the
floor
his
sight
is
sharp
enough
at
short
range
to
serve
his
purposes
if
his
attention
can
be
attracted
by
waving
a
hand
or
a
little
flag
or
a
flower
fifty
or
sixty
degrees
on
either
side
of
the
direction
in
which
he
is
looking
that
is
of
the
way
to
the
side
of
his
head
his
angle
of
vision
is
sufficiently
wide
if
he
can
pick
out
from
seven
balls
of
worsted
of
the
seven
primary
colors
red
orange
yellow
green
blue
indigo
and
violet
the
ball
that
matches
another
of
the
same
color
he
is
at
least
not
and
has
a
sufficient
sense
of
color
for
the
ordinary
purposes
of
life
it
may
be
necessary
to
wait
till
eighteen
months
for
a
satisfactory
color
test
color
blindness
when
present
is
usually
most
apparent
in
a
failure
to
distinguish
between
red
and
green
these
two
widely
differing
colors
seeming
to
produce
the
same
impression
upon
the
eye
the
child
will
be
just
as
likely
to
choose
a
red
ball
to
match
the
green
one
in
his
hand
as
to
select
another
red
ball
but
repeated
tests
should
be
made
before
accepting
color
blindness
as
a
fact
since
sometimes
the
brain
can
be
educated
to
discriminate
between
red
and
green
even
when
the
impressions
have
not
the
normal
degree
of
difference
the
tests
for
taste
smell
muscular
sense
touch
and
memory
can
not
be
made
with
much
thoroughness
or
satisfaction
till
two
years
of
age
though
observation
will
show
a
recognition
by
taste
and
smell
of
that
which
is
agreeable
and
that
which
is
disagreeable
accurate
tests
of
hearing
can
not
be
made
till
the
child
is
three
or
four
but
it
is
possible
when
he
is
twelve
months
old
to
determine
whether
the
hearing
is
normal
or
is
seriously
impaired
and
it
is
very
desirable
that
this
should
be
done
the
expression
seriously
impaired
when
applied
to
the
hearing
of
a
little
child
must
be
given
an
entirely
different
interpretation
than
it
would
have
if
used
with
reference
to
an
adult
who
had
previously
had
normal
hearing
a
degree
of
impairment
that
would
be
unimportant
in
an
adult
is
a
very
serious
matter
in
the
case
of
a
child
this
is
because
the
ear
is
the
natural
teacher
of
speech
and
language
if
the
sounds
of
speech
are
not
clearly
heard
the
imitation
of
them
will
always
be
imperfect
and
the
acquisition
of
language
will
be
impeded
if
deafness
is
so
great
that
spoken
words
are
not
heard
at
all
then
the
child
will
not
learn
to
speak
and
to
understand
when
spoken
to
unless
specially
taught
a
much
slighter
degree
of
deafness
will
prevent
the
proper
acquisition
of
speech
and
language
than
would
in
later
life
prevent
the
comprehension
of
conversation
in
a
familiar
language
as
even
the
child
of
fifteen
months
would
benefit
from
some
modifications
of
the
ordinary
treatment
of
a
baby
if
his
hearing
was
not
normally
acute
it
is
to
his
advantage
to
have
the
fact
of
his
deafness
known
at
once
by
those
in
charge
of
him
it
is
not
as
easy
as
it
might
seem
to
the
inexperienced
to
determine
even
approximately
the
situation
of
a
baby
with
respect
to
its
hearing
our
interest
here
is
of
course
in
the
tests
of
hearing
that
do
not
require
special
apparatus
and
special
training
in
the
case
of
a
child
less
than
two
years
of
age
we
must
rely
upon
merely
attracting
his
attention
by
various
sounds
judging
the
effect
upon
him
by
his
expression
and
actions
we
can
not
at
that
age
establish
a
system
of
responses
nor
expect
him
to
imitate
the
sounds
he
hears
sounds
should
be
used
for
testing
that
disturb
only
the
air
and
are
not
sufficiently
low
and
powerful
to
set
in
vibration
the
floor
chair
or
any
other
object
with
which
he
may
be
in
contact
deaf
children
rapidly
become
abnormally
sensitive
to
vibrations
which
are
to
them
what
noises
are
to
us
a
rather
smooth
not
too
shrill
whistle
is
one
excellent
sound
to
use
not
a
fluttering
whistle
like
the
postman
nor
a
heavy
tone
like
an
organ
pipe
or
bass
horn
clapping
the
hands
is
a
good
initial
test
of
a
crude
nature
then
a
moderate
whistle
varying
the
pitch
for
sometimes
high
sounds
are
perceived
but
not
low
ones
or
vice
versa
then
a
bell
such
as
a
small
table
bell
the
telephone
electric
door
bell
etc
lastly
the
human
voice
in
various
pitches
volumes
distances
and
vowels
little
by
little
it
can
be
determined
whether
the
child
hears
all
the
sounds
and
if
not
then
which
if
any
he
perceives
a
totally
deaf
child
may
often
deceive
the
investigator
by
turning
his
head
at
the
critical
moment
apparently
in
response
to
the
sound
that
was
made
while
on
the
other
hand
a
child
very
slightly
deaf
or
not
deaf
at
all
may
completely
ignore
the
sounds
made
for
the
purpose
of
attracting
his
attention
therefore
it
takes
time
and
repeated
tests
under
varying
environments
to
gradually
eliminate
possible
errors
and
coincidences
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
intensity
with
which
a
sound
affects
the
ear
varies
inversely
as
the
square
of
the
distance
from
the
ear
to
the
source
of
the
sound
that
is
to
say
if
exactly
the
same
sound
is
repeated
at
half
the
distance
the
intensity
with
which
it
reaches
the
ear
is
four
times
as
great
as
before
and
if
the
distance
is
quartered
the
intensity
is
sixteen
times
as
great
in
other
words
if
ah
is
spoken
with
a
certain
loudness
eight
inches
from
the
child
ear
and
then
again
with
exactly
the
same
pitch
and
volume
only
two
inches
from
his
ear
it
will
be
sixteen
times
as
loud
to
him
as
it
was
the
first
time
these
simple
tests
will
serve
to
determine
whether
the
child
has
or
has
not
a
normal
acuteness
of
hearing
they
will
not
serve
to
determine
with
any
accuracy
the
degree
of
impairment
if
it
is
found
that
the
hearing
is
impaired
at
all
more
thorough
tests
will
have
to
be
postponed
till
the
child
is
two
years
old
or
more
but
the
moment
that
impaired
hearing
is
suspected
the
best
available
ear
specialist
should
be
consulted
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
cause
can
be
removed
or
measures
taken
to
prevent
a
progressive
increase
in
deafness
the
visit
to
the
otologist
should
be
repeated
at
intervals
of
not
more
than
eight
or
ten
months
even
where
there
is
no
question
of
treatment
in
order
that
any
change
in
the
physical
condition
of
the
organs
may
be
promptly
detected
iii
how
shall
the
mother
get
into
communication
with
her
deaf
child
let
it
be
assumed
that
when
the
child
is
fifteen
months
old
it
is
fairly
well
established
that
his
hearing
is
somewhat
below
normal
between
fifteen
months
and
two
years
of
age
all
that
is
said
in
this
section
will
apply
equally
to
the
child
who
is
to
be
deaf
and
to
one
who
is
known
to
possess
some
sound
perception
though
not
a
normal
degree
of
hearing
for
until
he
is
old
enough
to
respond
to
more
complete
and
accurate
tests
we
must
not
give
up
the
idea
that
he
may
have
a
sufficient
remnant
of
hearing
to
be
of
great
assistance
to
him
in
the
acquisition
of
speech
and
language
if
it
is
only
developed
and
trained
between
the
ages
of
twelve
months
and
months
the
child
with
perfect
hearing
makes
rapid
progress
in
learning
to
understand
what
is
said
to
him
and
by
the
time
he
is
two
years
old
has
usually
begun
to
speak
many
words
and
sentences
in
a
more
or
less
imperfect
way
this
has
been
accomplished
principally
by
the
mother
constant
talking
to
her
baby
if
she
has
had
the
good
sense
to
always
speak
in
simple
but
complete
sentences
and
to
avoid
the
foolish
baby
talk
unfortunately
affected
by
some
people
in
addressing
little
children
the
results
of
her
daily
and
hourly
talk
is
the
possession
by
the
child
of
a
considerable
vocabulary
of
words
whose
meaning
he
knows
and
a
less
number
that
he
is
able
himself
to
speak
in
a
rather
imperfect
way
in
what
respects
should
the
mother
modify
her
treatment
of
the
baby
if
she
suspects
that
his
hearing
is
defective
she
should
not
talk
to
him
any
the
less
on
this
account
but
on
the
contrary
she
should
talk
to
him
more
she
should
however
speak
a
little
louder
a
little
nearer
to
him
possibly
a
little
more
slowly
and
distinctly
exercising
the
greatest
caution
however
not
to
exaggerate
speech
into
unnatural
facial
contortions
or
to
accompany
it
by
gestures
to
fall
into
the
habit
of
mouthing
and
gesticulating
making
faces
and
motions
will
defeat
entirely
the
purpose
of
all
efforts
to
develop
an
understanding
of
speech
by
the
child
unfortunately
such
exaggerated
and
absurd
speech
is
a
natural
and
very
prevalent
fault
to
avoid
it
is
absolutely
necessary
but
requires
constant
watchfulness
as
there
is
a
strong
temptation
to
try
to
make
easy
for
the
child
by
opening
the
mouth
wide
and
making
extraordinary
movements
of
the
tongue
the
object
aimed
at
is
to
lead
the
child
to
interpret
natural
everyday
speech
and
such
facial
contortions
and
exaggerations
cut
him
off
from
practice
in
reading
natural
speech
this
point
can
not
be
too
strongly
emphasized
speak
naturally
and
normally
to
the
deaf
child
above
all
the
mother
should
form
the
habit
of
watching
his
eyes
and
of
speaking
as
often
as
possible
when
his
gaze
is
fixed
upon
her
face
the
habit
on
his
part
of
looking
at
the
face
of
a
speaker
and
the
habit
on
his
mother
part
of
observing
his
gaze
and
when
it
wanders
of
pausing
in
her
talk
till
he
is
looking
at
her
again
are
two
very
valuable
aids
in
the
language
development
of
the
deaf
child
in
addition
to
always
raising
her
voice
a
little
in
speaking
to
her
baby
the
mother
should
several
times
a
day
take
him
in
her
lap
and
sing
to
him
and
talk
to
him
with
her
lips
not
far
from
his
ear
talk
to
him
just
as
all
mothers
do
to
their
babies
but
not
with
the
mangled
and
distorted
words
called
baby
talk
about
the
pussy
the
dog
the
bird
his
foot
his
toes
his
arms
and
hands
and
fingers
about
his
papa
brothers
sisters
about
the
flowers
the
grass
the
trees
and
a
thousand
other
things
say
the
good
old
mother
goose
rhymes
of
patty
cake
patty
cake
baker
man
this
little
pig
went
to
market
etc
but
in
all
your
frolics
and
stories
and
songs
take
the
greatest
care
that
he
shall
hear
or
see
or
better
still
see
hear
what
you
are
saying
gradually
he
can
be
taught
to
understand
many
simple
commands
and
questions
just
as
hearing
babies
learn
them
by
constant
repetition
at
times
and
under
circumstances
when
the
meaning
is
obvious
such
as
come
go
go
to
papa
come
to
mamma
jump
stop
kiss
mother
pet
pussy
pick
up
put
down
milk
water
bread
the
later
in
life
that
he
learns
the
meaning
and
taste
of
candy
the
better
do
you
want
some
bread
milk
water
etc
bring
my
slippers
bring
my
shoes
put
on
your
hat
take
off
your
mittens
wash
your
hands
throughout
the
whole
day
very
early
the
mother
should
learn
to
consider
the
direction
from
which
the
light
comes
and
should
be
careful
to
take
her
position
the
main
source
of
light
which
should
come
from
the
the
eye
can
be
trained
from
the
very
beginning
of
attention
to
unconsciously
supplement
an
imperfect
ear
in
comprehending
spoken
words
it
is
even
possible
for
the
eye
to
perform
the
entire
task
of
interpreting
speech
and
if
the
hearing
is
entirely
lacking
the
course
outlined
will
result
in
training
the
brain
to
interpret
the
movements
of
speech
as
seen
by
the
eye
as
it
would
have
been
trained
by
the
same
procedure
to
interpret
the
sounds
of
speech
had
the
organ
of
transmission
not
been
injured
but
the
idea
must
be
constantly
in
the
mind
of
the
mother
that
her
boy
needs
to
the
spoken
word
at
the
very
moment
the
idea
that
it
represents
is
in
his
as
often
as
he
would
hear
it
if
his
hearing
were
perfect
this
one
suggestion
if
faithfully
lived
up
to
from
the
age
of
one
year
to
that
of
two
years
would
be
almost
enough
but
there
are
other
things
that
the
mother
can
do
as
the
mental
development
of
the
baby
increases
with
each
month
of
life
she
should
encourage
him
to
babble
and
gurgle
and
murmur
as
much
as
possible
to
laugh
and
crow
and
make
all
the
various
baby
noises
that
will
train
and
develop
his
voice
encourage
noisy
romping
rollicking
games
as
he
gets
older
that
make
him
shout
and
call
for
they
are
the
natural
and
best
voice
exercises
iv
what
about
the
baby
speech
the
hearing
baby
babbles
because
he
gets
some
pleasure
from
the
sounds
and
also
because
he
desires
to
imitate
the
sounds
of
speech
he
hears
around
him
has
his
attention
called
constantly
to
the
sense
of
vibration
is
not
as
strong
nor
as
instructive
as
that
of
sound
but
if
of
the
child
is
early
to
it
a
watchfulness
for
vibration
within
as
well
as
from
without
can
be
aroused
and
a
sensitiveness
developed
that
would
not
have
come
as
early
if
at
all
without
special
directive
effort
on
the
part
of
the
mother
she
can
lead
her
little
one
to
and
and
mamma
and
by
doing
these
babblings
herself
while
the
baby
is
in
her
arms
and
his
tiny
hands
are
wandering
over
her
lips
and
face
and
throat
these
exercises
will
gradually
bring
a
recognition
on
the
part
of
the
child
of
the
sensation
of
vibration
that
accompanies
voice
and
they
will
give
facility
coupled
with
the
normal
and
natural
intonations
that
have
been
acquired
when
he
was
not
conscious
of
any
effort
that
will
prepare
him
for
a
better
and
more
fluent
speech
when
the
time
comes
for
more
exact
articulation
training
but
during
the
first
two
or
three
years
of
the
child
life
the
principal
stress
should
be
placed
upon
his
learning
to
understand
what
is
said
to
him
without
bothering
much
about
his
speaking
himself
in
the
case
of
the
hearing
child
the
understanding
of
language
comes
before
he
can
himself
utter
it
this
must
also
be
the
case
with
the
deaf
child
and
the
period
preceding
utterance
must
be
longer
by
reason
of
his
handicap
than
in
the
case
of
a
child
with
normal
hearing
v
developing
the
mental
faculties
by
the
time
he
is
two
years
old
he
has
gained
maturity
and
grasp
enough
to
play
many
little
educational
games
with
his
mother
and
his
little
brothers
and
sisters
or
playmates
these
games
should
be
calculated
to
develop
his
various
faculties
his
powers
of
observation
memory
and
concentration
to
develop
a
faculty
is
really
train
the
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
see
and
hear
and
taste
and
smell
and
feel
with
our
brains
the
eye
of
a
child
is
practically
as
perfect
an
optical
instrument
as
the
eye
of
a
boy
of
ten
and
yet
how
much
more
the
older
boy
seems
to
see
this
is
because
his
brain
has
been
trained
to
the
impressions
that
even
the
baby
eyes
received
but
did
not
understand
of
course
where
the
instrument
is
found
to
be
imperfect
we
can
assist
it
by
means
of
additional
lenses
or
perhaps
by
some
one
of
the
skillful
operations
now
performed
by
oculists
and
as
the
sight
is
of
such
increased
importance
to
a
deaf
child
the
greatest
care
and
watchfulness
should
be
given
to
his
eyes
do
not
let
him
sleep
or
lie
facing
the
sun
or
any
other
powerful
light
but
throughout
his
life
be
careful
that
all
his
use
of
eyesight
be
under
conditions
of
ample
and
light
supposing
that
the
simple
tests
referred
to
heretofore
have
shown
that
the
eyes
as
optical
instruments
are
sufficiently
perfect
our
efforts
need
to
be
to
train
the
brain
to
take
cognizance
of
and
to
interpret
the
impressions
transmitted
to
it
by
the
eyes
we
shall
not
be
able
to
improve
the
working
of
the
eye
by
our
efforts
but
we
can
educate
the
brain
color
and
form
make
the
earliest
appeal
to
the
child
eyes
and
we
can
use
them
for
our
educational
play
the
duplicate
set
of
worsted
balls
of
the
seven
primal
colors
can
be
increased
to
include
easily
distinguishable
shades
the
child
can
be
sent
on
entertaining
voyages
of
discovery
around
the
room
with
a
ball
of
a
certain
color
to
find
other
objects
similar
in
color
in
the
rugs
books
chairs
dresses
ties
etc
a
game
to
develop
observation
of
form
can
be
made
by
collecting
a
group
of
objects
of
varying
shapes
in
a
pile
on
the
floor
or
a
low
table
mother
picks
up
some
one
of
the
objects
directs
the
attention
of
the
little
one
to
it
and
after
he
has
observed
it
somewhat
she
puts
it
back
in
the
pile
and
moves
all
the
objects
about
till
they
are
well
mixed
up
ask
the
little
fellow
then
to
pick
out
the
object
mother
held
in
her
hand
a
moment
before
when
he
can
do
this
by
sight
without
difficulty
have
him
shut
his
eyes
place
an
object
in
his
little
hands
teach
him
to
feel
it
over
carefully
take
it
from
him
and
while
his
eyes
are
still
closed
place
it
once
more
in
the
pile
let
him
then
open
his
eyes
and
see
if
he
can
indicate
the
object
he
had
previously
held
when
he
has
mastered
this
give
the
game
another
turn
by
asking
him
to
find
by
means
of
touch
alone
while
the
eyes
are
still
closed
the
object
that
he
has
been
feeling
after
it
is
restored
to
the
pile
of
other
objects
still
another
turn
can
be
given
by
first
letting
him
see
the
object
without
touching
it
then
having
him
close
his
eyes
and
by
touch
alone
select
it
from
the
pile
a
set
of
wooden
forms
such
as
spheres
cubes
pyramids
cones
cylinders
and
similar
but
truncated
forms
can
be
obtained
at
any
school
supply
store
to
these
can
be
added
common
household
objects
such
as
small
frames
vases
napkin
rings
spoons
forks
and
other
similar
things
as
well
as
some
of
the
forms
included
in
a
complete
set
of
the
montessori
material
the
montessori
weighted
forms
are
excellent
for
training
his
muscular
recognition
of
difference
of
weight
and
an
excellent
way
is
to
put
various
quantities
of
birdshot
into
half
a
dozen
exactly
similar
little
rubber
balls
that
can
be
purchased
at
any
toy
store
for
two
cents
apiece
then
hand
the
boy
one
of
the
weighted
balls
and
after
he
has
felt
its
weight
put
it
back
with
the
other
balls
and
see
if
he
can
again
discover
it
an
outfit
for
training
his
tactile
sense
can
be
made
in
any
home
by
collecting
duplicate
pieces
of
cloth
having
different
textures
such
as
velvet
rough
woolen
tweeds
or
homespun
silk
satin
cambric
muslin
and
pasting
one
set
on
cards
also
by
stretching
on
a
wooden
frame
strings
of
varying
sizes
weaves
and
twists
and
having
a
bunch
of
duplicates
from
which
he
can
select
by
sight
and
touch
alone
the
pieces
that
correspond
each
to
each
with
those
on
the
frame
or
on
the
cards
if
there
is
a
guitar
or
mandolin
or
zither
or
a
piano
available
perhaps
by
and
by
the
mother
can
teach
the
child
to
recognize
the
difference
in
the
vibratory
sensation
perceived
by
his
fingers
touching
the
body
of
the
instrument
when
a
low
note
and
a
high
note
are
struck
alternately
she
can
make
a
game
of
this
too
by
later
having
him
close
his
eyes
and
place
his
fingers
in
contact
with
the
instrument
and
then
tell
her
what
string
or
key
she
struck
the
next
step
if
she
can
take
it
is
to
place
his
little
hands
upon
her
chest
to
feel
the
lowest
notes
of
her
voice
and
upon
both
the
chest
and
the
top
of
her
head
to
feel
the
highest
and
endeavoring
to
get
him
to
recognize
the
similarity
in
vibratory
sensation
between
what
he
now
feels
and
what
he
previously
felt
on
the
musical
instruments
the
last
step
in
this
series
of
exercises
to
awaken
a
recognition
of
vibratory
sensations
is
to
lead
him
to
feel
in
his
own
chest
and
head
the
vibrations
set
up
by
his
own
voice
in
shouting
and
laughing
crying
or
babbling
these
hints
that
are
so
quickly
and
easily
given
require
weeks
and
months
of
patient
effort
to
carry
out
beware
that
no
one
of
them
is
repeated
or
continued
so
long
at
a
time
as
to
become
a
thing
dreaded
and
disliked
remember
that
the
attention
of
a
little
child
is
like
a
constantly
flitting
butterfly
that
rests
for
only
a
moment
or
two
on
anything
before
dancing
away
to
something
else
there
are
many
little
games
with
kindergarten
materials
that
can
be
used
to
develop
the
powers
of
attention
observation
imitation
and
obedience
the
laying
in
simple
designs
by
watchful
imitation
of
the
mother
of
colored
sticks
colored
squares
etc
the
building
with
colored
blocks
stringing
of
beads
weaving
with
strips
of
colored
paper
simple
designs
that
a
mother
could
invent
with
the
material
at
hand
or
could
learn
from
any
kindergarten
manual
the
point
that
must
be
firmly
but
insisted
upon
in
these
exercises
is
careful
and
obedient
following
by
the
child
of
the
exact
order
of
movement
and
manner
of
placing
adopted
by
the
mother
teacher
the
entire
value
of
these
exercises
for
the
purpose
she
wishes
to
accomplish
depends
upon
by
the
child
and
the
material
outfit
prepared
and
sold
by
the
american
exploiters
of
the
montessori
method
is
admirably
adapted
to
the
development
of
the
budding
faculties
of
the
child
and
the
mother
who
is
trying
to
do
all
in
her
power
to
prepare
her
little
one
to
benefit
to
the
greatest
possible
extent
from
the
professional
instruction
that
must
come
later
will
make
no
mistake
in
supplying
herself
with
the
set
of
materials
and
making
herself

vi
developing
the
lungs
the
tendency
of
the
deaf
child
is
to
grow
up
with
less
development
of
lungs
and
of
the
imagination
than
hearing
children
in
order
to
overcome
this
tendency
the
child
must
be
encouraged
and
to
play
games
and
use
toys
that
will
exercise
the
lungs
and
develop
the
power
of
imaginative
thought
in
order
to
expand
and
strengthen
the
lungs
through
the
child

with
the
brightly
colored

he
can

though
the
torturing
squeak
of
the
toys

only

by
those
in
the
vicinity
and
not
by
himself
an
especially
good
exercise
for
the
gentle
and
control

breath
results
from
the
toy

a
fixed
point

without
any
apparent
support
blowing

to
blow

very
useful

do
playing

vii
the
cultivation
of
creative
imagination
this
can
be
greatly
helped
by
early
use
on
the
part
of
the
child
of
colored
modeling
wax
to
reproduce
objects
and
animals
and
to
construct
models
of

box
perhaps
five
feet
square
with
sides
six
inches
high
and
completely
lined
with
enamel
cloth
to
make
it
watertight
is
a
wonderful
implement
for
constructive
play
on
the
part
of
the
child

villages
of

and
simple

cultivate
observation
and
ingenuity
kaleidoscopes
and
stereoscopes
are
excellent
but
moving
pictures
are
so
trying
upon
the
eyes
and
the
air
of
the
theaters
is
so
bad
that
a
deaf
child
whose
eyes
are
his
only
salvation
and
whose
health
is
doubly
important
should
not
even
know
of
their
existence
till
he
is
seven
or
eight
years
old
viii
further
tests
of
hearing
but
as
soon
as
the
mother
finds
her
little
child
sufficiently
mature
to
benefit
by
the
sense
training
described
above
whether
it
be
at
twenty
or
as
is
more
likely
at
from
to
thirty
months
she
can
begin
to
make
a
more
complete
and
accurate
determination
of
the
degree
of
his
deafness
for
now
she
can
establish
a
system
of
responses
on
the
part
of
the
child
that
will
show
her
when
he
perceives
the
sounds
she
uses
in
her
tests
in
order
to
be
certain
that
the
little
one
knows
what
she
wishes
of
him
she
must
begin
with
some
sensation
that
she
is
sure
he
feels
we
will
assume
that
he
has
as
yet
no
speech
and
can
not
count
at
least
does
not
know
the
names
of
the
numbers
let
the
mother
pat
him
once
on
the
shoulder
and
then
cause
him
to
hold
up
one
of
his
little
fingers
then
pat
him
twice
and
make
him
hold
up
two
fingers
then
three
times
and
have
him
put
up
three
fingers
now
return
to
one
pat
and
one
finger
repeat
two
pats
and
the
holding
up
of
two
of
his
fingers
and
three
pats
and
three
fingers
go
over
and
over
this
little
game
until
he
has
grasped
the
idea
and
will
hold
up
as
many
fingers
as
he
feels
pats
simple
as
the
idea
seems
it
will
often
take
a
bright
child
some
time
to
realize
what
you
want
him
to
do
but
you
are
that
he
feels
the
pats
whereas
if
you
began
at
once
with
sounds
you
could
not
know
whether
his
failure
to
respond
was
because
he
did
not
hear
or
through
not
understanding
what
you
expected
of
him
he
will
weary
of
the
exercise
soon
and
then
mother
may
as
well
turn
to
something
else
till
he
has
rested
having
established
this
system
of
response
on
his
part
to
sensations
perceived
it
is
not
difficult
to
shift
from
the
number
of
pats
to
the
number
of
times
he
hears
a
noise
this
once
accomplished
tests
can
be
made
with
sounds
of
different
kinds
different
pitch
and
different
volume
varying
the
distance
the
instruments
and
the
vowel
when
the
articulate
sounds
are
reached
he
can
be
shown
a
whistle
then
when
it
is
blown
behind
his
back
he
will
hold
up
as
many
fingers
as
the
times
it
was
blown
if
he
perceives
the
sound
he
can
be
asked
to
distinguish
between
a
whistle
a
little
bell
and
the
clapping
of
the
hands
when
he
is
successful
in
that
the
vowel
sounds
may
be
uttered
not
far
from
his
ear
but
behind
him
begin
with
ah
ä
as
this
is
the
most
open
and
strongest
then
try
oh
o
with
macron
which
is
not
easily
confused
with
ä
then
ee
e
with
macron
if
after
a
time
a
distance
and
a
degree
of
loudness
are
found
that
enable
him
to
recognize
these
sounds
with
unfailing
accuracy
or
at
least
per
cent
of
the
time
then
other
sounds
can
be
added
such
as
aw
a
with
diaresis
below
a
with
breve
as
in
hat
i
with
macron
as
in
ice
oo
as
in
cool
ow
as
in
owl
using
these
sounds
at
different
pitches
and
with
different
intensities
and
distances
a
sufficiently
accurate
estimate
can
be
formed
of
the
degree
of
his
hearing
power
so
far
as
his
present
needs
are
concerned
ix
the
development
of
residual
hearing
if
any
ability
to
perceive
sounds
is
found
every
effort
should
be
made
to
lead
the
child
to
use
it
and
as
the
most
essential
use
of
hearing
is
in
the
comprehension
of
spoken
language
the
principal
effort
should
be
made
along
that
line
take
three
objects
the
names
of
which
are
short
with
the
principal
vowels
quite
easily
distinguished
a
little
toy
street
car
a
cap
and
a
toy
sheep
would
do
nicely
to
begin
with
as
the
three
words
car
cap
and
sheep
are
not
easily
confused
place
two
of
the
objects
before
him
the
car
and
the
sheep
and
speak
the
name
of
one
of
them
car
we
will
say
loudly
and
distinctly
close
to
his
ear
but
in
such
a
way
that
he
can
not
see
your
mouth
then
show
him
the
car
repeat
it
with
sheep
and
show
him
the
sheep
repeat
car
and
take
his
little
hand
put
it
on
the
car
then
sheep
and
make
him
put
his
hand
on
the
sheep
continue
this
process
until
he
will
indicate
to
you
the
object
you
name
when
he
makes
only
occasional
mistakes
with
two
objects
add
the
cap
when
he
can
get
the
right
one
about
per
cent
of
the
time
then
take
three
new
words
returning
occasionally
to
the
first
three
very
soon
his
own
name
and
those
of
others
with
photographs
to
enable
him
to
indicate
which
will
prove
of
interest
to
him
when
he
has
successfully
learned
to
distinguish
a
few
single
words
a
beginning
can
be
made
on
short
sentences
commands
that
he
can
execute
are
convenient
shut
your
eyes
open
your
mouth
clap
your
hands
can
follow
drill
on
the
three
words
eyes
mouth
hands
open
the
window
shut
the
window
open
the
book
shut
the
book
open
the
door
etc
stand
up
sit
down
when
this
beginning
has
been
made
the
road
is
open
to
the
gradual
increase
in
a
hearing
vocabulary
but
do
not
attempt
so
much
at
once
as
to
confuse
and
discourage
the
child
the
suggestions
already
made
should
be
studiously
followed
throughout
his
whole
childhood
if
his
hearing
is
not
too
seriously
impaired
he
will
begin
to
attempt
to
imitate
spoken
sounds
by
the
time
he
is
to
thirty
months
old
but
his
ability
to
imitate
sounds
is
not
an
accurate
measure
of
his
ability
to
hear
he
may
perceive
the
sounds
much
better
than
he
is
able
to
reproduce
them
distinct
utterance
comes
slowly
to
the
child
with
normal
hearing
and
still
more
slowly
and
imperfectly
to
the
child
whose
hearing
is
not
good
but
the
continued
effort
to
make
him
hear
and
is
a
very
valuable
exercise
for
him
and
should
be
faithfully
continued
till
he
is
old
enough
to
respond
to
the
tests
of
hearing
as
outlined
and
it
has
been
definitely
proved
that
he
can
not
possibly
tell
whether
ä
or
o
with
macron
or
e
with
macron
is
said
no
matter
how
loud
or
how
near
the
ear
the
sound
is
uttered
the
question
will
naturally
arise
as
to
whether
the
child
hearing
of
speech
can
be
aided
by
an
electric
or
mechanical
device
when
it
is
possible
to
make
the
child
perceive
the
sound
of
the
vowels
with
the
unaided
voice
uttered
very
near
the
ear
i
believe
it
to
be
better
at
first
not
to
interpose
any
artificial
device
but
i
have
found
that
sometimes
in
cases
where
the
sound
perception
was
not
at
first
sufficient
to
enable
the
child
to
distinguish
even
the
most
dissimilar
vowel
sounds
although
uttered
loudly
close
to
the
ear
i
could
awaken
the
attention
of
the
child
to
sound
and
stimulate
the
dormant
power
by
the
use
of
an
acousticon
after
a
few
months
i
have
been
able
to
dispense
with
the
instrument
and
use
only
the
unaided
voice
at
close
range
later
when
some
vocabulary
has
been
acquired
through
these
auricular
exercises
it
is
often
desirable
to
return
to
the
acousticon
and
teach
the
child
to
use
it
in
to
extend
the
distance
at
which
sounds
can
be
by
the
use
of
the
acousticon
it
then
becomes
possible
to
communicate
by
means
of
the
ear
without
speaking
at
such
short
range
it
is
not
easy
however
to
induce
a
child
to
use
an
acousticon
at
all
times
whereas
an
adult
will
take
the
time
and
trouble
necessary
to
become
accustomed
to
the
instrument
and
will
put
up
with
the
slight
inconveniences
inseparable
from
its
use
x
developing
the
power
of
lip
reading
in
this
effort
to
develop
the
hearing
however
the
necessity
must
not
be
forgotten
of
also
training
the
brain
to
associate
ideas
with
what
the
eye
sees
on
the
lips
when
words
are
spoken
in
the
case
of
the
very
slightly
deaf
child
this
visual
training
is
not
quite
so
important
as
the
auricular
training
but
when
there
is
much
deafness
it
is
the
more
important
of
the
two
the
comprehension
of
much
language
can
be
given
to
the
little
deaf
child
by
constantly
talking
just
as
any
mother
does
to
her
hearing
baby
only
being
always
careful
to
take
a
position
facing
the
main
source
of
light
which
should
come
behind
the
the
hearing
child
arrives
at
the
association
of
meaning
with
the
sounds
of
words
only
after
very
many
repetitions
how
often
must
the
child
hear
mamma
look
at
mamma
see
here
is
mamma
mamma
is
coming
mamma
is
here
where
is
mamma
do
you
love
mamma
mamma
loves
baby
from
morning
to
night
day
after
day
week
after
week
the
mother
does
it
for
pleasure
to
play
with
and
pet
the
dear
baby
she
does
not
think
of
it
as
a
teaching
exercise
but
it
is
a
very
important
one
the
deaf
baby
will
learn
gradually
to
associate
a
meaning
with
the
various
sequences
of
movement
of
the
lips
if
a
little
care
is
taken
to
watch
his
eyes
and
to
speak
when
they
are
directed
toward
the
speaker
and
to
stand
in
such
relation
to
the
light
that
it
falls
upon
the
speaker
face
the
speech
should
be
the
same
as
to
the
hearing
child
but
it
takes
a
little
more
care
and
watchfulness
to
have
the
deaf
child
the
same
word
or
phrase
as
as
the
hearing
child
hears
it
if
it
is
spoken
when
the
baby
is
not
looking
it
does
not
help
when
the
little
one
is
learning
to
walk
the
mother
says
come
to
mamma
go
to
daddy
and
gradually
he
learns
come
and
go
she
has
him
play
hide
and
seek
with
another
child
and
she
says
where
is
tom
where
is
the
baby
mouth
where
is
the
baby
nose
and
by
and
by
he
knows
where
and
mouth
and
nose
and
the
names
of
his
playmates
or
brothers
and
sisters
when
he
is
sitting
on
the
floor
she
picks
him
up
saying
up
when
she
puts
him
from
her
lap
to
the
floor
she
says
down
if
he
is
naughty
she
says
naughty
and
perhaps
spats
his
little
hands
and
so
on
through
the
day
a
little
care
on
her
part
a
little
added
thought
and
watchfulness
perhaps
a
few
more
repetitions
and
little
by
little
she
will
find
her
deaf
baby
learning
to
look
at
her
always
and
to
understand
much
that
is
said
to
him
she
must
all
this
time
remember
also
that
the
shades
of
feeling
pleasure
disappointment
approval
disapproval
doubt
certainty
love
anger
joy
which
are
largely
conveyed
to
the
hearing
child
by
intonation
of
voice
must
be
conveyed
to
the
deaf
baby
by
facial
expression
and
manner
they
become
very
keen
at
interpreting
moods
by
the
look
let
the
face
be
sunny
and
kind
and
interested
if
possible
the
first
indication
of
impatience
of
being
bored
and
weary
will
destroy
much
of
one
influence
with
the
deaf
child
sometimes
it
is
harder
to
disguise
one
feelings
in
the
face
than
in
the
voice
do
not
be
caught
unawares
interest
cheerfulness
and
patience
are
tremendous
forces
to
help
the
little
deaf
child
some
one
has
said
when
you
consent
consent
cordially
when
you
refuse
refuse
finally
when
you
punish
punish
xi
forming
character
and
now
that
the
little
one
is
two
or
three
years
old
it
may
be
well
to
say
a
few
words
about
his
general
training
in
character
and
habits
there
is
a
strong
and
a
not
unnatural
tendency
to
maintain
an
attitude
toward
the
deaf
child
that
differs
from
that
maintained
by
sensible
mothers
toward
their
other
children
they
often
set
up
a
different
standard
of
conduct
and
of
obligation
for
the
afflicted
child
his
brothers
and
sisters
are
taught
to
always
defer
to
his
wishes
even
to
the
extent
of
yielding
to
improper
and
selfish
demands
on
his
part
and
conceding
that
they
have
no
rights
where
he
is
concerned
he
is
not
required
to
perform
the
little
duties
demanded
of
the
other
children
he
is
given
privileges
which
the
others
do
not
and
which
no
one
of
them
including
himself
should
enjoy
he
grows
tyrannical
domineering
and
selfish
the
mother
says
poor
little
chap
he
has
trouble
enough
we
must
do
all
in
our
power
to
make
up
to
him
for
what
he
misses
by
reason
of
his
deafness
this
is
however
a
shortsighted
and
really
a
cruel
policy
it
lays
up
much
misery
for
his
future
and
in
the
end
proves
a
serious
handicap
to
one
who
needs
to
have
as
few
additional
difficulties
as
possible
though
it
may
seem
it
is
really
kinder
to
put
him
on
the
same
basis
as
any
other
child
make
him
do
everything
possible
for
himself
insist
upon
his
being
independent
dressing
himself
as
soon
as
he
is
able
buttoning
his
own
shoes
and
performing
all
the
little
acts
that
the
wise
mother
demands
of
all
her
children
make
no
distinction
in
the
treatment
accorded
him
ask
the
same
services
reward
right
actions
and
punish
wrongdoing
as
impartially
as
if
he
was
not
deaf
only
being
sure
that
he
clearly
connects
the
punishment
with
the
wrong
act
this
in
the
case
of
a
deaf
child
requires
a
little
more
care
than
with
a
hearing
child
train
him
to
be
thoughtful
for
the
comfort
of
others
and
respectful
of
their
rights
just
as
you
insist
that
the
others
observe
his
rights
he
can
not
be
argued
with
object
lessons
and
example
must
be
the
means
of
teaching
him
manners
and
morals
xii
cultivating
the
social
instinct
between
the
ages
of
two
and
four
years
all
the
games
and
exercises
heretofore
described
can
continue
to
be
used
together
with
others
increasingly
difficult
and
complicated
as
the
child
mind
develops
and
his
powers
of
observation
attention
and
memory
increase
take
very
special
care
that
he
learns
all
the
childhood
games
that
other
children
know
and
enjoy
devote
yourself
more
to
him
in
this
respect
than
you
would
in

of
another

encourage
the

to
come

games
in
which

naturally
laugh

are
the
best
of
exercises
and
by
such
means
and
his
shouting
and
calling
to
his
playmates
the

in

whose
turn
is
it
etc
if
the
foregoing
suggestions
have
been
carefully
carried
out
since
he
was
twelve
months
old
he
will
long
ago
have
arrived
unconsciously
at
the
knowledge
that
all
things
and
all
actions
and
all
feelings
have
names
and
that
the
mouth
always
makes
the
same
sequence
of
movements
for
the
same
thing
in
the
babbling
exercises
recommended
he
will
gradually
come
to
utter
many
of
the
vowel
and
consonant
sounds
of
his
native
language
especially
those
that
are
made
by
the
lips
and
by
evident
positions
of
the
tongue
those
sounds
that
require
hidden
positions
of
the
organs
such
as
the
sound
of
c
and
k
in
cat
and
ark
or
g
in
go

dog

unlikely

have
stumbled
upon
these
can
be
taught
when
the
proper
time
comes
but
their
absence
for
the
present
need
cause
no
anxiety
in
fact
up
to
the
time
when
he
is
three
and
a
half
or
four
years
old
the
matter
of
speaking
is
not
one
to
be
much
troubled
about
if
the
conception
of
language
has
been
given
him
through
and
some
ability
to
understand
the
necessary
language
of
his
daily
life
his
future
success
is
assured
xiii
something
about
schools
and
methods
till
the
child
is
at
least
four
years
old
the
proper
place
for
him
is
at
home
and
if
he
must
be
sent
to
one
of
the
large
public
schools
for
the
deaf
it
should
not
be
till
he
is
five
or
even
six
years
of
age
but
during
these
years
the
mother
can
gain
much
knowledge
that
will
help
her
by
visiting
as
many
schools
for
the
deaf
as
possible
there
are
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
such
schools
in
the
united
states
and
eight
in
canada
they
vary
in
size
in
character
and
in
methods
of
instruction
employed
there
are
public
boarding
schools
and
public
day
schools
free
to
the
resident
of
the
state
or
city
in
which
they
are
located
there
are
private
boarding
and
day
schools
maintained
by
charity
or
by
the
tuition
fees
some
of
each
class
are
oral
schools
that
is
they
employ
only
speech
methods
of
instruction
without
any
signs
or
finger
spelling
others
are
called
combined
schools
that
is
they
permit
and
in
some
exercises
encourage
the
use
of
finger
spelling
and
gestural
signs
while
they
also
give
some
instruction
by
the
speech
method
there
are
sectarian
and
schools
both
oral
and
combined
a
very
considerable
number
of
schools
for
the
deaf
in
the
united
states
and
canada
still
use
manual
or
silent
methods
of
instruction
at
least
in
part
but
the
speech
or
oral
method
is
steadily
growing
in
popularity
and
gradually
supplanting
manual
spelling
and
gestural
signs
the
time
will
certainly
come
when
the
public
will
be
too
intelligent
to
any
longer
tolerate
the
use
between
teacher
and
pupil
or
between
any
employee
and
the
pupils
in
a
school
for
the
deaf
any
system
of
manual
communication
deaf
child
no
matter
if
born
totally
deaf
and
of
a
low
order
of
intelligence
can
be
given
as
much
education
by
the
exclusive
use
of
the
speech
method
as
it
can
by
any
manual
or
silent
method
or
by
a
combination
of
the
speech
and
the
silent
this
is
not
the
mere
expression
of
an
opinion
but
the
statement
of
a
fact
a
fact
firmly
established
by
actual
results
in
state
institutions
where
unfortunately
the
law
requires
the
admission
of
pupils
too
poorly
equipped
intellectually
to
belong
in
a
school
with
normally
bright
children
in
addition
to
acquiring
all
the
education
of
which
his
mental
endowment
makes
him
capable
he
can
be
taught
to
speak
and
to
understand
when
spoken
to
the
degree
of
perfection
attainable
depends
upon
the
ability
of
the
child
the
skill
of
the
teaching
and
especially
upon
in
which
the
child
passes
its
formative
educational
years
the
probability
of
the
child
acquiring
a
maximum
proficiency
in
speaking
and
in
understanding
others
when
they
speak
is
lessened
in
direct
proportion
to
the
extent
to
which
he
is
permitted
to
use
the
silent
or
manual
means
of
communication
in
the
combined
schools
the
is
largely
manual
a
visit
to
the
playgrounds
the
baseball
fields
the
shops
dining
rooms
and
dormitories
of
combined
schools
will
disclose
the
pupils
using
silent
means
of
communication
not
only
between
themselves
with
those
in
charge
of
them
they
do
not
think
in
spoken
forms
but
in
finger
spelling
and
the
powerful
influence
of
environment
in
those
schools
is
the
acquisition
of
the
speech
and
habit
the
mother
who
has
faithfully
followed
the
suggestions
offered
in
the
foregoing
pages
will
be
able
to
appreciate
what
she
sees
on
visiting
the
schools
and
will
gain
much
more
from
such
visits
than
one
who
is
entirely
inexperienced
in
the
problem
every
mother
should
make
it
her
business
to
visit
at
least
one
school
in
order
that
she
may
make
herself
thoroughly
intelligent
on
what
may
be
expected
of
a
deaf
child
unfortunately
pure
oral
schools
are
not
as
plentiful
as
combined
schools
but
it
will
well
repay
any
parent
to
make
a
journey
even
across
the
continent
if
necessary
in
order
to
study
the
workings
of
some
good
purely
oral
school
do
not
be
satisfied
with
a
visit
to
the
nearest
combined
school
owe
it
to
your
to
make
yourself
thoroughly
intelligent
as
to
the
open
to
a
deaf
child
you
will
not
be
intelligent
till
you
have
personally
visited
some
good
school
the
number

of
the

constantly
changing

xiv
the
preservation
of
speech
when
deafness
results
from
accident
or
illness
after
infancy
up
to
this
point
it
has
been
assumed
that
deafness
occurred
before
the
age
of
two
years
and
before
the
child
had
begun
to
speak
in
cases
where
through
accident
or
illness
impairment
of
hearing
has
come
after
the
child
has
begun
to
talk
the
mother
should
bend
all
her
efforts
upon
keeping
the
speech
of
her
child
the
younger
the
child
the
more
difficult
is
the
task
without
the
greatest
vigilance
and
increasing
attention
the
speech
of
a
little
child
who
has
become
deaf
will
fade
rapidly
away
until
it
is
lost
entirely
and
must
be
artificially
recreated
when
he
is
old
enough
to
grasp
the
complicated
ideas
involved
in
speech
teaching
to
the
deaf
but
by
persistently
encouraging
him
to
talk
and
never
even
for
a
day
allowing
him
to
lapse
into
silence
and
not
accepting
careless
and
faulty
utterance
but
pretending
not
to
understand
till
the
child
speaks
distinctly
and
the
natural
speech
which
was
his
before
deafness
occurred
can
be
preserved
and
the
speech
habit
thoroughly
fixed
if
by
good
luck
the
little
one
has
learned
to
read
even
a
simple
primer
before
becoming
deaf
it
will
be
much
easier
to
prevent
a
loss
of
speech
for
this
reading
can
be
made
an
excuse
for
frequently
using
his
speech
but
when
the
child
can
not
read
the
mother
must
depend
entirely
upon
inducing
him
to
talk
to
her
refusing
to
give
him
anything
or
grant
his
request
till
he
asks
for
it
in
good
spoken
form
showing
him
pictures
playing
games
frolicking
with
him
doing
everything
that
a
mother
love
and
ingenuity
can
suggest
to
keep
him
talking
all
day
long
the
tendency
of
the
child
will
be
to
drop
or
slur
the
final
syllables
of
the
words
to
leave
off
the
sound
of
final
to
lose
the
sharpness
of
the
to
blur
the
and
sometimes
to
lose
the
sound
of
and
but
if
he
has
learned
to
read
by
pointing
to
these
letters
in
the
words
he
has
spoken
imperfectly
he
will
correct
his
own
mistake
prompt
and
increasing
attention
to
the
little
fellow
speech
during
the
first
year
after
deafness
occurs
will
usually
serve
to
fix
correct
habits
for
life
xv
teaching
lip
reading
all
that
has
been
said
about
training
the
little
deaf
child
to
read
the
lip
movements
and
associate
them
with
the
names
of
things
and
of
actions
will
apply
also
to
the
little
boy
who
has
suddenly
been
made
deaf
after
speech
has
been
learned
be
careful
that
he
is
looking
at
you
always
when
you
speak
to
him
or
reply
to
some
question
he
has
asked
but
speak
just
as
you
would
have
done
before
he
became
deaf
you
may
have
to
repeat
things
to
him
very
often
at
first
but
do
not
permit
any
sign
of
impatience
in
your
face
do
not
let
him
get
the
idea
that
it
is
a
hardship
to
talk
to
him
remember
that
you
are
changing
his
manner
of
understanding
speech
over
to
another
way
and
that
his
present
and
future
happiness
depends
very
greatly
on
the
thoroughness
and
promptness
with
which
it
is
done
in
all
dealings
with
a
deaf
child
the
mother
should
remember
that
the
child
draws
his
impressions
of
the
character
and
the
feelings
of
those
about
him
from
the
expression
of
their
faces
and
many
almost
unconscious
little
acts
and
gestures
avoid
very
carefully
any
appearance
of
being
impatient
or
bored
or
contemptuous
at
his
failures
try
to
understand
the
difficulties
under
which
he
is
working
to
maintain
his
place
in
the
world
do
not
humor
his
whims
or
spoil
him
by
indulgence
yet
treat
him
with
the
greatest
consideration
and
fairness
above
all
be
cheerful
and
at
least
apparently
interested
in
his
doings
and
sayings
xvi
school
age
the
question
of
what
is
school
age
for
a
deaf
child
is
answered
very
differently
by
different
people
most
of
the
state
institutions
for
the
deaf
in
the
united
states
canada
and
europe
will
not
admit
children
younger
than
six
years
of
age
seven
years
is
still
the
age
of
admission
in
some
institutions
but
the
tendency
is
to
lower
the
age
limit
in
some
schools
children
of
five
are
admitted
in
a
few
those
as
young
as
four
and
in
two
or
three
small
schools
babies
of
two
and
three
are
received
any
statement
here
must
therefore
be
taken
as
only
the
expression
of
the
author
opinion
resulting
from
more
than
years
of
active
teaching
combined
with
wide
observation
it
would
appear
that
where
home
conditions
are
not
bad
either
physically
or
morally
the
proper
place
for
the
little
deaf
child
till
he
is
nearly
or
quite
five
is
with
his
mother
very
much
can
be
done
for
the
little
one
before
he
is
five
to
prepare
him
for
the
instruction
which
should
be
given
at
that
age
but
it
is
possible
for
the
mother
to
do
what
is
necessary
and
even
the
simplest
home
conditions
are
preferable
for
very
little
children
to
the
institutional
environment
it
is
impossible
in
a
school
of
from
one
hundred
to
five
hundred
pupils
to
create
a
real
home
environment
such
as
the
very
little
child
should
have
it
is
really
a
pity
that
the
child
of
five
should
have
to
be
placed
in
the
institutional
environment
as
it
at
present
exists
if
the
legislative
bodies
of
our
states
and
the
gentlemen
who
manage
the
schools
could
only
be
induced
to
adopt
the
cottage
plan
of
housing
in
small
units
the
disadvantages
of
institutional
life
would
be
enormously
reduced
xvii
organized
efforts
by
parents
to
obtain
better
educational
conditions
it
should
be
possible
for
every
taxpayer
in
every
state
who
has
a
deaf
child
and
who
has
not
the
means
or
the
wish
to
place
that
child
in
a
private
school
to
have
the
child
educated
in
a
free
public
school
as
completely
by
the
speech
method
as
his
hearing
children
are
educated
by
that
method
he
should
not
be
compelled
to
send
his
child
out
of
the
state
or
else
subject
him
to
the
influence
of
signs
and
finger
spelling
with
the
probability
that
he
will
leave
school
a
deaf
mute
unfortunately
in
many
states
this
is
not
possible
at
present
but
if
the
parents
of
deaf
children
would
organize
themselves
into
associations
and
send
representatives
to
the
governors
and
legislative
committees
and
arrange
for
demonstrations
by
orally
educated
deaf
children
from
pure
oral
schools
and
carry
on
an
active
campaign
of
enlightenment
and
of
agitation
the
present
state
of
affairs
would
soon
cease
to
exist
i
wish
to
make
an
urgent
plea
for
the
energetic
efforts
of
all
parents
of
deaf
children
to
improve
the
conditions
in
their
respective
localities
at
present
very
far
from
all
that
is
possible
is
being
done
to
give
deaf
children
a
ready
command
of
spoken
english
and
a
working
ability
to
understand
when
spoken
to
the
persons
who
have
the
most
at
stake
in
this
matter
and
who
should
be
most
active
and
persistent
in
demanding
from
the
school
authorities
and
legislatures
better
facilities
for
the
acquisition
of
speech
by
deaf
children
are
the
parents
of
those
children
in
each
locality
these
parents
should
organize
into
parents
associations
these
local
associations
should
in
turn
be
connected
by
a
statewide
organization
composed
of
representatives
from
each
local
association
these
state
organizations
could
then
be
combined
by
representation
in
a
national
organization
of
all
the
parents
of
deaf
children
in
the
united
states
such
complete
organization
once
effected
the
reasonable
demands
made
in
the
interests
of
better
results
in
speech
teaching
would
quickly
be
complied
with
by
the
respective
schools
and
the
legislatures
or
boards
of
directors
that
control
them
the
associations
could
induce
their
local
papers
to
aid
in
a
campaign
to
educate
public
opinion
by
printing
facts
concerning
what
is
done
elsewhere
if
all
parents
of
deaf
children
only
knew
what
might
be
accomplished
and
were
so
organized
as
to
permit
them
to
present
their
wishes
forcibly
to
those
able
to
change
conditions
the
deaf
child
would
quickly
come
into
his
own
xviii
a
personal
matter
for
each
parent
let
some
parent
in
each
locality
make
it
his
or
her
business
to
get
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
other
parents
of
deaf
children
in
the
vicinity
induce
them
to
come
together
some
evening
and
choose
a
chairman
and
an
executive
committee
of
three
let
these
four
people
make
a
point
of
studying
the
education
of
the
deaf
as
conducted
in
the
most
advanced
communities
let
the
executive
committees
of
the
several
local
associations
get
together
once
or
twice
a
year
for
a
sort
of
state
convention
of
parents
let
them
invite
leading
educators
to
address
them
and
let
them
appoint
committees
to
visit
schools
in
other
states
where
different
methods
are
employed
if
such
a
movement
was
once
started
there
would
be
found
plenty
of
for
discussion
and
plenty
of
opportunities
to
work
for
a
betterment
of
conditions
the
author
of
this
little
book
would
be
glad
to
give
any
aid
in
his
power
to
such
a
movement
and
to
place
the
results
of
his
years
of
experience
at
the
disposal
of
any
parent
or
parents
organization
the
first
efforts
should
be
directed
to
inducing
or
compelling
the
combined
schools
for
the
deaf
throughout
the
united
states
to
wholly
segregate
at
least
a
small
oral
department
from
the
manually
taught
pupils
the
orally
taught
pupils
should
never
come
in
contact
during
their
school
life
either
in
the
shops
dining
rooms
playgrounds
or
schoolrooms
with
those
pupils
with
whom
finger
spelling
and
signs
are
employed
all
employees
whether
superintendents
teachers
supervisors
teachers
of
trades
or
servants
who
have
to
do
with
the
orally
taught
pupils
should
be
to
use
only
speech
and
lip
reading
and
writing
if
absolutely
necessary
under
penalty
of
dismissal
for
failing
to
do
so
only
by
means
of
such
segregation
and
the
enforcement
of
speech
as
a
universal
medium
of
communication
can
the
appropriations
for
oral
work
be
made
really
productive
of
good
results
in
what
are
now
called
combined
schools
this
can
be
done
on
a
small
scale
at
the
beginning
with
the
little
entering
beginners
then
if
all
beginners
are
put
into
this
oral
department
it
will
gradually
grow
at
the
expense
of
the
manual
department
until
after
a
period
of
eight
or
ten
years
the
entire
school
will
have
become
oral
this
is
the
only
method
of
procedure
by
which
satisfactory
results
in
speech
teaching
for
practical
purposes
can
be
obtained
in
return
for
the
generous
appropriations
that
the
states
make
it
has
been
fully
demonstrated
by
actual
operation
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
where
the
largest
school
for
the
deaf
in
the
world
has
in
this
manner
been
changed
from
a
combined
school
to
a
pure
oral
school
the
deaf
children
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
are
now
taught
wholly
by
the
oral
method
if
that
polyglot
and
heterogeneous
population
can
be
so
treated
there
is
no
state
in
the
union
where
the
same
could
not
be
done
if
there
were
the
desire
and
the
ambition
to
do
it
in
many
states
deaf
children
have
been
either
by
definite
statement
or
by
tacit
understanding
exempted
from
the
enforcement
of
the
compulsory
education
law
this
is
all
wrong
they
need
the
protection
of
that
excellent
law
even
more
than
the
hearing
child
and
if
the
law
for
compulsory
education
does
not
in
fact
apply
to
them
it
should
at
once
be
amended
to
do
so
xix
day
schools
the
parents
are
the
ones
most
interested
in
this
matter
and
it
is
through
their
efforts
alone

improvement
can
be
brought
about

this
movement
has
reached
its
highest
development
in
wisconsin
and
michigan
in
wisconsin
there
are
such
schools
scattered
throughout
the

and
in

fourteen
new

are
opened
by
the
board
of
education
under
prescribed
conditions
upon
the
request
of
a
certain
number
of
parents
of
deaf
children
such
a
law
should
be
on
the
statute
books
of
every
state
and
will
be
when
the
parents
of
deaf
children
organize
and
demand
it
xx
the
deaf
child
at
five
years
of
age
when
the
little
child
that
has
been
deaf
from
infancy
is
five
years
of
age
he
should
be
placed
in
a
oral
for
the
deaf
if
such
a
thing
is
possible
the
child
who
has
become
deaf
by
illness
or
accident
after
speech
has
been
acquired
should
be
placed
under
experienced
instruction
by
the
speech
method
to
quote
once
more
from
my
little
book
of
suggestions
to
physicians
if
the
proper
school
for
the
little
hearing
child
of
five
did
not
happen
to
exist
in
his
immediate
neighborhood
no
one
would
think
of
insisting
upon
the
necessity
of
sending
the
little
one
away
to
a
distant
boarding
school
but
that
is
what
must
be
done
in
the
case
of
the
little
deaf
child
if
precious
and
irrecoverable
years
are
not
to
be
lost
it
is
often
a
difficult
matter
to
persuade
a
mother
to
sacrifice
her
own
personal
happiness
and
comfort
in
having
the
little
child
with
her
and
to
look
far
enough
into
the
future
to
see
that
a
true
and
unselfish
love
for
the
child
requires
her
to
entrust
him
to
the
care
of
others
during
those
early
and
crucial
years
xxi
schools
for
the
hearing
and
private
governesses
if
no
oral
day
or
boarding
school
is
available
near
at
hand
the
mother
should
have
the
love
that
is
unselfish
and
the
courage
to
part
with
her
little
child
during
the
months
of
the
school
year
and
place
him
in
some
one
of
the
distant
schools
where
he
can
live
and
be
taught
in
a
purely
oral
environment
there
are
two
alternatives
to
this
each
of
which
is
sometimes
attempted
but
both
are
undesirable
first
the
mother
not
infrequently
attempts
to
have
her
child
educated
in
the
schools
for
hearing
children
this
is
very
unsatisfactory
and
even
dangerous
for
if
persisted
in
it
results
in
wholly
inadequate
progress
uneven
development
bad
speech
irretrievable
loss
of
time
and
often
in
a
complete
nervous
breakdown
this
may
not
come
for
some
years
but
the
nervous
system
once
undermined
by
the
excessive
strain
of
trying
to
keep
up
under
impossible
conditions
can
never
be
fully
repaired
here
is
what
a
deaf
woman
writes
of
her
experience
as
a
child
when
i
was
three
and
years
old
scarlet
fever
left
me
almost
totally
deaf
my
father
was
a
physician
he
was
urged
to
send
me
to
a
school
for
the
deaf
but
his
medical
training
told
him
that
what
was
needed
was
association
with
speaking
children
if
i
were
to
retain
my
speech
for
at
that
time
the
oral
method
was
unknown
in
our
state
so
i
went
to
school
with
hearing
children
unless
you
have
been
deaf
you
will
not
understand
the
misery
in
this
statement
a
little
lonely
deaf
child
i
went
to
a
public
school
hearing
practically
nothing
of
the
teachers
instructions
or
the
pupils
recitations
of
the
torture
of
that
deaf
childhood
i
will
not
speak
you
all
know
how
cruel
children
may
be
and
a
deaf
child
among
hearing
children
often
suffers
untold
torments
the
second
alternative
is
to
seek
some
person
who
will
teach
the
child
in
his
own
home
this
too
is
very
unsatisfactory
and
involves
loss
of
time
and
opportunity
that
can
never
be
recovered
in
the
first
place
the
beginning
years
of
a
deaf
child
educational
life
are
the
most
important
of
all
they
are
crucial
it
is
then
he
requires
the
highest
skill
the
greatest
experience
and
the
most
perfect
conditions
the
best
teachers
can
seldom
if
ever
be
induced
to
teach
a
single
child
in
its
home
usually
these
teachers
are
more
or
less
inferior
but
even
the
best
teacher
in
the
world
can
not
do
for
a
little
deaf
child
in
his
home
what
she
could
accomplish
for
him
in
a
and
properly
conducted
school
neither
the
intellect
nor
the
character
of
the
deaf
child
can
be
as
successfully
developed
after
five
years
of
age
by
a
private
teacher
in
his
home
as
in
a
good
school
the
following
elements
are
essential
for
the
highest
educational
welfare
of
a
deaf
child
the
stimulus
and
incentive
of
association
and
competitive
companionship
the
contact
with
more
than
one
mind
and
more
than
one
speaker
the
avoidance
of
becoming
dependent
upon
some
one
as
an
interpreter
and
the
cultivation
of
independence
and
through
constant
practice
with
various
teachers
a
fully
equipped
and
trained
organization
providing
a
complete
and
uninterrupted
education
under
one
head
regularity
of
life
and
the
subordination
of
all
living
conditions
to
the
highest
educational
advantage
a
thing
utterly
incompatible
with
home
conditions
these
most
necessary
conditions
are
not
possible
of
attainment
through
private
instruction
in
the
home
the
child
who
is
kept
at
home
and
given
private
instruction
too
often
grows
up
to
be
timid
and
unfitted
to
cope
with
the
difficulties
and
oppositions
of
the
world
he
falls
an
easy
prey
to
temptation
and
is
quickly
discouraged
by
obstacles
very
often
he
is
selfish
narrow
and
overbearing
not
having
those
about
him
of
his
own
age
and
with
the
same
desires
he
has
become
accustomed
to
having
people
yield
to
his
whims
and
fancies
as
child
playmates
would
not
yield
he
is
more
or
less
excluded
from
the
plays
and
pleasures
of
childhood
all
those
about
him
have
an
advantage
over
him
on
the
other
hand
the
tendencies
of
the
child
are
to
be
simple
natural
and
childlike
his
inclination
to
moodiness
and
suspiciousness
is
much
less
he
is
happier
he
becomes
independent
and
respectful
of
the
rights
of
others
he
is
less
petulant
and
more
obedient

wisest
parents
do
not
educate
their
hearing
children
at
home
nor
should
they
attempt
it
with
a
deaf
child
xxii
importance
of
the
beginning
i
wish
to
lay
very
special
stress
upon
the
necessity
the
of
the
most
expert
and
experienced
instruction
that
is
attainable
if
circumstances
make
it
impossible
to
give
to
the
child
the
best
the
time
then
he
should
have
the
best
at
the
start
rather
than
later
every
effort
and
every
sacrifice
that
are
ever
going
to
be
made
for
the
child
sake
should
be
at
the
beginning
of
his
school
training
and
not
delayed
till
he
is
older
the
years
from
five
to
eight
or
ten
will
determine
his
future
success
if
he
has
poor
teaching
during
these
early
years
even
the
best
teaching
later
will
not
be
able
to
make
up
the
loss
entirely
but
if
he
has
good
teaching
during
the
first
few
years
then
less
expert
teaching
later
can
not
do
him
as
much
harm
as
it
otherwise
would
the
early
years
are
his
most
crucial
period
and
the
best
efforts
should
be
expended
then
instead
of
when
he
is
twelve
or
fourteen
xxiii
avoid
the
young
and
inexperienced
teacher
between
the
ages
of
five
and
ten
avoid
the
young
and
inexperienced
teacher
and
the
amateur
as
you
would
the
plague
unfortunately
the
idea
is
prevalent
that
can
teach
a
little
child
but
that
it
takes
experience
to
teach
the
older
pupils
this
is
a
disastrous
fallacy
young
and
inexperienced
women
are
too
often
quite
ready
to
assume
the
great
responsibility
of
teaching
a
little
deaf
child
they
rush
in
where
angels
might
well
fear
to
tread
unfortunately
parents
and
even
school
superintendents
are
often
too
ready
to
permit
them
to
do
this
dangerous
thing
xxiv
on
entering
school
through
the
courtesy
of
the
in
which
her
article
appeared
and
of
the
author
miss
eleanor
worcester
a
teacher
of
the
deaf
for
many
years
and
at
one
time
the
principal
of
a
school
i
am
able
to
include
the
following
very
sensible
and
valuable
advice
for
the
guidance
of
mothers
when
their
children
enter
school
the
first
year
at
school
by
eleanor
worcester
at
last
the
time
has
come
when
you
feel
that
it
is
best
for
your
boy
to
study
with
other
children
and
since
your
own
town
does
not
offer
him
a
suitable
opportunity
it
is
necessary
to
send
the
little
fellow
to
one
of
the
boarding
schools
where
trained
and
wise
men
and
women
are
devoting
their
thought
and
energy
to
giving
every
advantage
of
education
comfort
and
happiness
to
the
little
people
under
their
care
you
have
already
decided
after
much
thought
and
the
writing
of
many
letters
perhaps
after
a
visit
to
the
school
you
incline
to
most
just
where
it
is
best
that
the
child
shall
go
you
have
studied
carefully
all
the
directions
about
clothing
given
in
the
school
catalogue
and
have
made
sure
that
every
little
blouse
or
stocking
has
its
owner
name
written
or
sewed
fast
on
it
and
that
all
the
small
garments
are
in
perfect
order
and
ready
for
use
but
have
you
thought
how
your
own
attitude
toward
this
change
in
your
boy
life
is
unconsciously
preparing
him
either
to
rebel
against
and
fear
school
or
to
look
forward
to
going
there
as
one
of
the
most
delightful
and
interesting
events
of
his
life
i
know
that
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
avoid
dreading
the
day
when
your
child
must
go
among
strangers
but
i
beg
you
not
to
let
him
see
what
your
feeling
is
it
will
take
all
your
resolution
and
all
your
courage
to
wear
not
only
a
cheerful
face
but
a
happy
one
but
you
must
make
your
boy
feel
that
a
very
delightful
time
is
coming
if
you
go
about
the
necessary
preparations
as
you
might
if
he
were
going
to
the
show
or
on
a
visit
he
will
enter
into
the
spirit
of
things
with
enthusiasm
but
if
you
once
let
him
find
you
crying
over
his
packing
he
will
immediately
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
some
dreadful
thing
is
in
prospect
and
will
be
entirely
prepared
to
be
frightened
at
being
left
at
school
and
to
break
your
heart
by
clinging
to
you
and
begging
to
go
home
again
and
more
than
this
he
will
be
far
more
likely
to
be
homesick
so
since
you
know
it
is
best
for
him
to
be
in
school
and
that
it
is
the
only
possible
road
to
happiness
and
usefulness
why
not
lead
him
to
anticipate
the
going
to
look
forward
to
it
as
a
treat
and
to
feel
that
to
be
a
schoolboy
is
really
the
great
end
of
existence
one
of
the
first
steps
in
this
direction
will
be
to
help
him
understand
a
little
what
kind
of
a
place
he
is
bound
for
very
likely
the
school
you
have
decided
on
publishes
an
illustrated
catalogue
and
weeks
before
school
opens
begin
to
show
him
the
pictures
of
the
school
buildings
and
grounds
and
make
him
understand
that
on
a
certain
day
in
september
which
you
mark
on
the
calendar
with
bright
crayon
you
and
he
will
go
there
let
him
see
one
of
the
little
white
beds
where
he
will
sleep
after
you
return
home
the
sunny
dining
room
where
he
will
eat
his
morning
porridge
and
his
sunday
ice
cream
the
playground
full
of
rollicksome
youngsters
with
whom
he
will
seesaw
and
play
tag
by
and
by
and
the
busy
schoolroom
where
so
many
delightful
and
interesting
things
are
sure
to
happen
talk
about
all
these
things
often
and
brightly
and
you
will
find
that
school
has
become
a
most
desirable
and
fascinating
place
and
that
every
night
there
will
be
a
great
satisfaction
in
climbing
on
a
chair
to
scratch
off
from
the
calendar
another
day
done
before
the
joy
of
going
there
then
you
can
buy
such
delightful
things
to
be
put
into
that
waiting
trunk
things
often
to
be
looked
at
but
never
to
be
used
till
that
wonderful
place
is
reached
long
red
and
blue
pencils
with
rubbers
on
the
ends
boxes
of
writing
paper
all
gay
with
pictures
and
exactly
right
for
the
first
letters
home
a
foot
rule
and
if
you
are
a
truly
brave
mother
a
real
jackknife
to
sharpen
the
same
red
and
blue
pencils
and
add
to
the
joy
of
living
it
is
absorbing
work
too
to
mark
them
all
with
one
name
so
they
may
never
be
mistaken
for
any
other
little
boy
property
and
to
make
a
place
for
a
new
toy
or
two
though
if
you
are
wise
you
will
not
buy
many
playthings
now
but
will
save
them
to
send
later
one
by
one
by
parcel
post
to
be
received
with
a
joy
it
is
a
pity
you
can
not
be
there
to
see
it
will
be
so
out
of
proportion
to
any
other
pleasure
you
could
give
by
such
simple
means
of
course
you
must
have
some
kodak
pictures
taken
ever
so
many
of
them
showing
the
family
the
house
and
the
pets
as
well
as
the
boy
himself
these
are
to
be
kept
too
to
go
in
letters
they
will
be
not
only
very
precious
possessions
but
if
they
are
labeled
carefully
they
will
be
extremely
useful
in
the
classroom
when
your
boy
begins
to
learn
to
speak
the
names
of
the
people
at
home
since
they
are
to
be
used
for
this
double
purpose
be
sure
that
each
member
of
the
family
group
is
very
distinctly
marked
or
the
names
of
aunt
mary
and
sister
helen
may
get
hopelessly
mixed
in
the
boy
mind
finally
the
last
little
garment
and
the
last
package
is
in
the
trunk
the
last
day
is
scratched
off
the
calendar
and
the
boy
himself
is
on
the
train
and
now
let
me
tell
you
something
that
you
will
not
believe
that
you
will
even
resent
but
which
is
perfectly
true
and
which
i
hope
will
comfort
you
a
little
when
you
say
to
the
boy
and
that
is
this
it
really
is
very
unusual
for
a
little
child
from
five
to
eight
years
old
to
be
homesick
at
school
there
are
so
many
distractions
so
many
new
and
curious
things
to
see
so
many
interesting
things
to
do
and
there
are
so
many
other
children
all
friendly
and
all
happy
that
even
if
your
boy
cries
when
you
leave
him
the
probabilities
are
high
that
before
you
reach
the
station
he
will
be
playing
shyly
or
uproariously
as
temperament
may
decide
but
certainly
happily
with
some
friend
one
of
the
most
delightful
things
about
a
school
for
deaf
children
is
the
way
all
the
other
pupils
welcome
pet
and
look
out
for
a
newcomer
every
one
makes
much
of
him
and
it
would
be
hard
indeed
to
be
lonely
long
in
the
midst
of
so
much
attention
and
friendliness
and
now
a
word
about
letters
before
you
sent
the
boy
to
school
i
hope
you
did
fail
to
teach
him
to
recognize
the
written
names
of
the
different
members
of
the
family
so
that
he
might
be
sure
to
understand
whom
his
first
letters
came
from
and
do
forget
that
he
will
be
eager
for
letters
too
many
mothers
feel
that
it
is
useless
to
write
to
their
children
during
their
first
year
away
from
them
they
are
so
sure
that
no
word
from
them
can
be
understood
that
they
content
themselves
with
sending
inquiries
to
the
proper
authorities
and
an
occasional
picture
postcard
to
the
children
themselves
and
fail
to
realize
how
soon
their
little
boy
or
girl
grasps
the
fact
that
the
other
children
have
real
letters
in
envelopes
and
that
these
come
from
home
or
how
sharp
a
disappointment
it
is
when
day
after
day
goes
by
and
brings
them
nothing
if
you
could
see
as
i
have
seen
a
letter
so
worn
that
it
was
cracked
on
all
its
folds
and
dingy
with
much
handling
carried
day
after
day
inside
a
little
blouse
or
guimpe
and
put
under
the
pillows
every
night
you
would
understand
a
little
what
those
pieces
of
paper
covered
with
very
imperfectly
understood
characters
but
carrying
love
and
remembrance
from
home
mean
even
before
the
children
can
read
them
and
very
soon
if
you
are
an
observant
mother
your
child
will
really
be
able
to
read
them
for
example
your
boy
first
letter
may
be
something
like
this
dear
mamma
i
am
well
i
love
you
harry
when
you
answer
it
you
might
say
with
the
certainty
that
every
word
would
be
understood
dear
harry
mamma
loves
you
papa
is
well
mamma
and
papa
love
you
mamma
not
a
very
satisfactory
letter
do
you
say
perhaps
not
to
you
but
most
delightful
and
understandable
to
the
little
boy
to
whom
it
is
written
and
if
a
little
later
you
follow
it
with
another
containing
one
of
the
kodak
pictures
of
the
cat
with
tommy
written
under
it
accompanying
such
a
note
as
this
not
only
your
little
boy
but
his
teacher
will
bless
you
dear
harry
mamma
is
well
papa
is
well
mamma
and
papa
love
you
tommy
loves
you
too
tommy
is
the
cat
tommy
wants
to
see
you
mamma
i
have
written
these
two
notes
not
as
models
to
be
copied
but
to
show
you
how
with
a
little
thought
and
care
you
may
ring
the
changes
on
almost
every
sentence
that
your
boy
learns
and
make
use
of
every
new
word
giving
him
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
helping
to
fix
the
phrases
in
his
mind
and
to
make
him
realize
that
they
are
really
valuable
additions
to
his
means
of
communication
but
i
do
not
mean
that
you
should
confine
your
letters
entirely
to
words
and
sentences
that
the
child
already
knows
in
fact
new
expressions
if
they
are
short
and
simple
and
if
the
main
part
of
your
letter
is
made
up
of
things
the
child
understands
at
once
will
add
very
much
to
the
interest
of
your
letter
he
will
be
eager
to
know
what
the
strange
words
mean
and
the
new
nouns
verbs
and
adjectives
will
go
immediately
to
swell
his
vocabulary
like
any
child
just
learning
to
talk
your
little
boy
will
at
first
use
nouns
when
later
he
will
use
pronouns
so
in
your
earliest
letters
to
him
you
will
be
surer
of
making
yourself
understood
if
you
do
the
same
probably
too
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
sentences
like
i
am
well
i
love
you
you
will
notice
that
all
his
statements
are
written
in
the
past
tense
and
that
will
be
a
guide
to
you
to
confine
your
own
remarks
to
the
past
for
the
most
part
till
you
notice
that
he
has
begun
to
use
the
future
and
the
present
himself
watch
his
letters
carefully
and
adapt
your
own
language
forms
to
his
there
are
two
things
that
as
a
general
rule
i
would
advise
you
not
to
write
about
and
these
are
any
illnesses
in
the
family
and
that
supreme
joy
of
school
life
the
box
you
are
planning
to
send
my
reasons
for
this
taboo
are
that
even
very
little
children
are
often
made
unhappy
and
anxious
sometimes
for
days
if
they
know
there
is
sickness
at
home
while
in
the
second
place
boxes
are
so
often
delayed
that
they
become
the
source
of
much
disturbance
of
mind
when
the
expressman
fails
to
bring
them
i
knew
a
little
girl
who
watched
every
delivery
for
a
week
and
cried
after
every
one
because
the
box
her
mother
had
promised
her
did
not
appear
so
let
illness
and
boxes
go
unmentioned
till
you
can
write
something
like
this
papa
was
sick
last
week
he
is
well
now
he
goes
to
the
office
every
day
and
after
the
box
has
had
time
to
reach
its
destination
you
can
say
mamma
sent
a
box
to
you
wednesday
she
put
two
handkerchiefs
some
new
shoes
six
oranges
and
some
money
in
the
box
papa
gave
the
money
to
you
if
you
are
like
most
mothers
before
many
weeks
have
gone
by
you
will
be
eager
to
visit
your
boy
and
see
for
yourself
how
he
is
getting
on
whether
he
is
really
as
happy
as
the
letters
from
school
assure
you
he
is
what
he
is
learning
in
class
and
whether
he
has
blankets
enough
on
his
bed
and
sugar
enough
on
his
oatmeal
but
before
the
letter
announcing
the
day
of
your
arrival
is
posted
or
your
ticket
is
bought
sit
down
by
the
fire
and
think
the
matter
over
you
have
confidence
in
the
school
else
you
would
never
have
sent
your
boy
there
and
you
have
been
told
repeatedly
either
that
the
little
fellow
is
happy
and
well
or
it
may
be
that
he
was
rather
homesick
at
first
but
has
now
settled
down
to
a
very
comfortable
and
contented
state
of
mind
and
is
doing
well
in
class
now
if
you
go
to
see
him
too
soon
after
he
has
left
home
there
will
really
be
a
good
deal
more
danger
that
the
boy
will
be
homesick
after
you
leave
him
than
there
was
when
you
took
him
to
school
in
september
even
if
he
has
been
quite
happy
up
to
the
time
of
your
visit
in
the
first
place
he
will
think
drawing
his
conclusions
from
visits
that
he
may
have
made
before
that
school
is
over
and
that
you
have
come
to
take
him
home
so
it
will
be
a
great
surprise
and
shock
when
you
go
away
without
him
and
in
any
case
after
the
separation
of
some
weeks
his
love
for
you
will
make
him
want
to
be
with
you
and
he
will
really
suffer
when
you
say
so
if
i
were
you
i
would
wait
till
after
the
christmas
holidays
before
going
for
my
visit
by
that
time
he
will
be
fully
settled
in
his
new
life
and
will
look
on
it
as
an
established
part
of
existence
he
will
know
from
observation
that
other
mothers
come
for
a
little
while
and
then
go
home
again
without
taking
their
children
with
them
and
his
advance
in
understanding
will
make
it
much
easier
to
explain
to
him
that
your
visit
is
temporary
and
will
not
make
any
radical
change
in
his
own
life
the
delay
will
mean
a
good
deal
of
for
you
but
may
very
possibly
save
your
boy
from
a
sharp
attack
of
homesickness
while
later
in
the
year
this
danger
will
usually
have
disappeared
and
your
visit
will
bring
nothing
but
pleasure
to
you
both
and
will
help
to
make
school
what
you
want
it
to
be
a
place
where
all
sorts
of
delightful
things
are
constantly
sure
to
happen
xxv
during
the
school
period
but
the
opportunities
and
obligations
of
the
parents
of
deaf
children
to
aid
in
their
education
by
no
means
cease
when
the
children
enter
school
throughout
the
entire
period
of
school
life
and
even
after
their
children
leave
school
the
parents
can
be
of
very
great
assistance
to
them
during
the
time
that
the
school
is
in
session
if
the
child
is
away
from
home
the
parents
should
write
not
less
than
once
a
week
and
oftener
if
possible
these
letters
should
contain
all
the
little
happenings
at
home
no
matter
how
insignificant
and
uninteresting
they
may
seem
if
these
things
are
expressed
in
simple
language
using
short
sentences
and
common
words
the
letters
will
be
one
of
the
most
efficient
means
of
aiding
the
children
to
an
ability
to
read
that
the
teacher
possesses
the
child
is
full
of
eager
curiosity
to
know
the
smallest
details
of
the
familiar
home
life
he
will
exert
his
mind
more
to
dig
out
the
meaning
of
the
language
of
home
letters
than
he
will
to
understand
a
story
in
a
reader
miss
worcester
has
suggested
one
or
two
little
letters
that
would
do
during
the
first
half
year
at
school
by
the
beginning
of
the
second
year
it
would
be
helpful
if
the
letters
read
something
like
this
my
dear
boy
we
got
your
nice
letter
thank
you
for
it
we
always
like
to
know
what
you
do
at
school
we
like
to
know
the
names
of
your
schoolmates
we
are
glad
when
you
tell
us
about
your
books
and
your
teachers
mother
tom
jane
and
i
are
well
we
talk
about
you
often
we
are
glad
you
can
go
to
school
a
cat
frightened
the
hens
the
hens
ran
the
cat
was
naughty
i
drove
the
cat
away
i
think
the
cat
wanted
to
eat
the
little
chickens
tom
hid
behind
the
door
he
jumped
out
quickly
he
frightened
jane
she
screamed
he
laughed
jane
cried
mother
scolded
tom
because
he
made
jane
cry
tom
said
jane
was
a
baby
jane
said
tom
was
a
bad
boy
then
jane
laughed
she
forgave
tom
tom
said
he
was
sorry
we
all
love
you
your
loving
father
each
year
the
letters
can
be
a
little
more
grown
up
and
they
should
always
be
frequent
xxvi
during
vacation
when
vacation
time
comes
and
the
children
come
home
for
the
summer
the
home
folks
will
probably
have
some
trouble
at
first
in
understanding
their
imperfect
speech
do
not
be
discouraged
the
speech
will
steadily
improve
from
year
to
year
and
you
will
soon
be
able
to
comprehend
it
even
when
it
is
very
faulty
but
do
not
accept
from
the
child
anything
except
the
best
speech
he
is
capable
of
when
the
boy
first
arrives
you
will
probably
not
know
just
how
much
to
expect
of
him
to
begin
with
it
will
do
him
no
harm
to
ask
him
to
repeat
what
he
says
even
if
you
really
did
understand
him
the
first
time
he
will
probably
speak
much
more
distinctly
the
second
time
than
he
did
the
first
and
you
will
see
that
you
can
demand
of
him
more
than
you
at
first
thought
he
could
do
he
will
not
be
discouraged
by
being
asked
to
repeat
he
is
used
to
it
the
price
of
good
speech
like
the
price
of
liberty
is
eternal
vigilance
during
the
school
period
teachers
and
parents
should
give
unremitting
attention
to
demanding
of
the
children
time
they
the
best
enunciation
of
which
they
are
at
that
time
capable
if
you
do
not
understand
the
boy
or
he
does
not
understand
you
do
not
let
him
resort
to
gestures
nor
use
them
yourself
give
him
pencil
and
paper
if
necessary
it
will
not
be
necessary
often
or
long
and
each
day
occasions
of
difficulty
will
grow
fewer
provide
some
useful
and
helpful
occupation
for
the
child
for
at
least
a
part
of
each
day
do
not
let
him
play
at
random
all
the
time
continue
a
certain
regularity
of
life
in
the
matter
of
meals
and
getting
up
and
going
to
bed
insist
upon
respectful
behavior
and
good
manners
he
has
these
demanded
of
him
at
school
do
not
let
him
return
in
the
fall
having
lost
much
that
he
had
gained
during
the
preceding
year
when
he
is
at
home
keep
him
in
touch
with
the
activities
and
the
topics
of
discussion
in
the
family
circle
do
not
let
him
withdraw
or
feel
shut
out
this
will
take
a
good
deal
of
effort
and
and
patience
but
in
the
long
run
it
will
repay
the
parents
failure
to
do
this
will
eventually
bring
sorrow
to
all
concerned
train
the
other
children
to
do
their
share
of
this
insist
upon
their
telling
the
deaf
one
their
plans
and
their
doings
unless
some
care
is
taken
he
will
see
the
others
going
without
knowing
where
or
why
he
will
sometimes
lose
pleasures
because
he
did
not
hear
the
talk
that
was
going
on
around
him
and
no
one
thought
to
tell
him
this
has
a
tendency
to
make
him
bitter
and
unsocial
from
the
very
beginning
of
spoken
intercourse
with
the
deaf
child
the
greatest
care
should
be
taken
to
speak
naturally
to
him
avoid
entirely
all
exaggeration
of
lip
movement
and
mouth
opening
speak
a
little
slowly
perhaps
and
always
distinctly
but
never
with
facial
contortions
and
waving
hands
the
aim
of
his
oral
training
is
to
enable
him
to
understand
the
ordinary
speech
of
people
when
they
speak
to
him
and
to
do
this
he
requires
an
immense
amount
of
practice
just
as
the
hearing
child
requires
a
great
deal
of
practice
for
years
before
he
can
understand
what
people
are
saying
to
him
if
you
speak
to
him
in
a
different
way
from
that
employed
when
speaking
to
others
he
will
learn
to
understand
that
but
not
your
ordinary
manner
of
speaking
he
will
also
imitate
it
himself
the
chinaman
speaks
and
understands
only
pidgin
english
because
only
pidgin
english
has
been
used
in
communicating
with
him
if
people
had
spoken
to
the
chinaman
as
they
do
to
other
people
he
would
have
gradually
acquired
good
english
so
it
is
with
the
deaf
child
if
you
want
him
to
gradually
learn
to
understand
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
life
you
must
exercise
him
in
it
for
years
you
must
not
expect
him
to
get
much
at
first
any
more
than
you
expect
the
baby
to
understand
to
start
with
but
each
month
he
will
gain
more
and
by
the
time
he
is
sixteen
or
seventeen
he
will
have
very
nearly
overtaken
his
hearing
brother
but
if
you
always
address
him
with
a
yawning
mouth
and
flopping
tongue
and
lips
and
use
english
to
him
he
will
progress
in
his
understanding
and
use
of
that
but
it
is
not
what
you
wish
him
to
acquire
be
patient
be
gentle
be
untiring
and
unremitting
in
your
efforts
but
be
natural
your
eyes
on
his
eyes
and
speak
only
when
his
gaze
is
upon
your
before
closing
i
ought
to
say
that
more
is
the
pity
there
are
many
persons
who
live
by
trading
upon
the
ignorance
and
credulity
of
the
unfortunate
the
deaf
and
the
friends
of
the
deaf
fall
an
easy
prey
to
the
advertisements
of
quack
remedies
ear
drums
that
are
always
useless
and
sometimes
actually
dangerous
the
american
medical
association
has
had
the
courage
to
issue
a
pamphlet
in
which
these
fake
cures
are
described
and
exposed
and
every
deaf
person
and
parent
of
a
deaf
child
should
have
one
of
these
pamphlets
the
title
is
deafness
cure
fakes
and
can
be
obtained
by
writing
to
the
american
medical
association
north
dearborn
street
chicago
illinois
any
one
who
has
read
these
pages
will
easily
see
that
the
suggestions
are
all
aimed
to
secure
for
the
deaf
a
treatment
similar
in
kind
though
somewhat
different
in
degree
to
that
accorded
the
normal
hearing
person
the
tendency
has
been
to
differentiate
the
deaf
too
much
from
the
hearing
by
adopting
the
procedure
of
pure
oralism
effectively
applied
under
oral
uncontaminated
during
the
educational
period
from
five
to
twenty
years
of
age
by
finger
spelling
or
signs
the
deaf
will
be
far
more
fully
restored
to
a
normal
position
in
the
social
and
industrial
world
than
they
can
ever
be
by
the
silent
methods
at
present
so
largely
used
during
their
most
impressionable
years
xxvii
some
nots
do
not
be
downcast
deafness
does
not
necessarily
bring
dumbness
do
not
consider
the
deaf
child
as
different
from
other
children
do
not
cease
talking
to
him
do
not
speak
with
exaggerated
facial
movements
do
not
exempt
him
from
the
duties
and
tasks
and
obedience
properly
demanded
of
all
children
do
not
let
him
grow
selfish
do
not
let
him
grow
indifferent
do
not
be
in
haste
do
not
show
impatience
