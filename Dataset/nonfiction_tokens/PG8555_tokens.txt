way
to
the
beginner

satisfy
and
more
especially
to
excite
his
initial
curiosity

affords
an
adequate
idea
of
the
march
of
facts
and
of
ideas

reader
is
led
somewhat
rapidly
from
the
remote
origins
to
the
most
recent
efforts
of
the
human
mind

should
be
a
convenient
repertory
to
which
the
mind
may
revert
in
order

see
broadly
the

what
connected
it
with
those
that
followed
or
preceded
it
it
aims
above
all
at
being
in
which
can

the
course
of
further
studies
new
conceptions
more
detailed
and
more
thoroughly
examined

will
have
fulfilled

moral
literature
the
the
ancient
indians
who
spoke
sanscrit
possess
a
literature
which
goes
back
perhaps
to
the
fifteenth
century
before
christ
at
first
like
all
other
races
they
possessed
a
sacred
literature
intimately
bound
up
with
their
religion
the
earliest
volumes
of
sacred
literature
are
the
they
describe
and
glorify
the
gods
then
worshipped
to
wit
agni
god
of
fire
of
the
domestic
hearth
of
the
celestial
fire
the
sun
of
the
atmospheric
fire
lightning
indra
god
of

analogous
to
zeus
of

greeks
soma

moon
varuna

nocturnal
vault
the
god
who
rewards
the
good
and
punishes
the
evil
rudra
the
irascible
god
more
evil
than
well
disposed
though
sometimes
helpful
others
too
very
numerous
the
style
of
the
is
continually
poetic
and
metaphorical
they
contain
a
sort
of
metaphysics
as
well
as
continual
allegories
buddhism
a
philosophical
religion
sufficiently
analogous
to
christianity
which
sakyamuni
surnamed
buddha
the
wise
spread
through
india
towards
created
a
new
literature
it
taught
as
will
be
remembered
the
equality
of
all
castes
in
the
sight
of
religion
metempsychosis
charity
and
detachment
from
all
passions
and
desires
in
order
to
arrive
at
absolute
calm
the
literature
it
inspired
was
primarily
that
is
sententious
analogous
to
that
of
pythagoras
with
a
tendency
towards
little
moral
tales
and
parables
as
in
the
gospel
this
literature
subsequently
expanded
into
large
and
even
immense
epic
poems
of
which
the
principal
are
the
and
the
the
the
the
that
is
the
history
of
the
is
a
legend
or
a
novel
in
verse
intersected
with
moral
digressions
with
episodes
vaguely
related
to
the
subject
with
discourses
and
prayers
there
are
charming
episodes
full
of
delicate
sensibility
of
moving
tenderness
that
is
to
say
of
human
beauty
comparable
to
the
farewells
of
hector
and
andromache
in
homer
and
everywhere
amid
tediousness
and
monotony
is
found
a
powerful
and
superabundant
imagination
the
the
name
of
the
author
of
which
valmiki
has
come
down
to
us
is
a
poem
yet
more
vast
and
unequal
there
are
portions
which
to
us
are
quite
unreadable
and
there
are
others
comparable
to
the
most
imposing
and
most
touching
in
all
epic
poetry
reduced
to
its
theme
the
subject
of
is
extremely
simple
it
is
the
history
of
prince
rama
dispossessed
of
his
throne
who
saw
his
beloved
wife
sita
ravished
by
the
monstrous
demon
ravana
who
made
alliance
with
the
good
monkeys
and
with
them
constructed
a
bridge
over
the
sea
to
reach
the
island
on
which
sita
was
detained
who
vanquished
and
slew
ravana
who
sita
and
finally
went
back
happily
to
his
kingdom
which
had
also
been
the
most
noticeable
exterior
characteristic
of
the
is
the
almost
constant
mingling
of
men
and
animals
a
mingling
which
one
feels
is
in
conformity
with
the
dogma
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
not
only
monkeys
but
vultures
eagles
gazelles
are
brought
into
the
work
and
form
important
personages
we
are
in
the
epoch
when
the
animals
spoke
battles
are
numerous
and
described
in
great
detail
the
is
the
of
the
indians
pathetic
scenes
as
well
as
those
of
love
of
friendship
of
gratitude
are
not
rare
and
are
sometimes
exquisite
the
whole
poem
is
imbued
with
a
great
feeling
of
humanity
heroism
and
justice
victory
is
to
the
good
and
right
is
triumphant
the
gods
permit
that
the
just
should
suffer
and
be
compelled
to
struggle
but
invariably
it
is
only
for
a
time
and
the
merited
happiness
is
at
the
end
of
all
after
these
two
vast
giant
epics
there
were
written
among
the
indians
a
number
of
shorter
narrative
poems
very
varied
both
in
tone
and
manner
which
suggest
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
highly
important
and
animated
schools
of
literature
nearer
to
our
own
time
that
is
towards
the
fifth
or
sixth
century
of
our
era
lyric
poetry
and
the
drama
were
as
it
were
detached
from
the
epopee
and
existed
on
their
own
merits
songs
of
love
of
hate
of
sadness
or
of
triumph
took
ample
scope
they
were
more
often
melancholy
than
sad
for
india
is
the
land
of
optimism
or
at
least
of
resignation
dramatic
as
for
the
dramatic
poetry
that
is
very
curious
it
is
not
mixed
with
epopee
in
the
precise
sense
of
the
word
but
it
is
continually
mingled
with
descriptions
of
nature
with
of
nature
and
invocations
to
nature
the
indian
dramatic
poet
did
not
separate
man
from
the
air
he
breathed
nor
from
the
world
around
him
in
recalling
the
moment
of
the
day
or
night
in
which
the
scene
takes
place
actual
the
poet
no
doubt
in
obedience
to
a
law
dictated
to
him
by
his
public
kept
his
characters
in
communication
with
earth
and
heaven
with
the
dawn
he
described
the
moon
he
painted
the
evening
he
caused
to
be
seen
the
plants
he
portrayed
as
withering
or
reviving
the
birds
which
he
showed
everywhere
in
the
country
or
returning
to
their
habitation
etc
from
the
purely
dramatic
aspect
these
plays
are
often
affecting
or
curious
possessing
penetrating
and
thoughtful
psychology
the
most
celebrated
dramas
still
left
to
us
of
the
indian
stage
are
chariot
of
baked
and
the
affecting
and
delicate
the
gem
of
indian
literature
the
work
of
the
poet
kalidas
who
was
also
a
remarkable
lyric
poet
gnomic
gnomic
that
is
sententious
poetry
which
it
has
been
indicated
very
early
enjoyed
high
appreciation
among
the
indians
long
continued
to
obtain
their
approval
it
was
always
wise
and
often
intellectual
the
collection
of
barthari
who
belonged
to
the
sixth
or
seventh
century
contains
thoughts
which
would
do
honour
to
the
highest
moralists
of
the
most
enlightened
epochs
the
fortune
ample
or
restricted
which
the
creator
hath
inscribed
on
thy
forehead
thou
wilt
assuredly
attain
wert
thou

the
desert
or
in
the
of
meru
more
couldst
thou
not
acquire
therefore
of
what
avail
to
torment
thyself
and
to
humiliate
thyself
before
the
powerful
a
pot
does
not
draw
more
water
from
the
sea
than
from
a
well
and
this
might
be
by
a
modern
man
opposing
la
rochefoucauld
the
modest
man
is
one
poor
in
spirit
the
devout
a
hypocrite
the
honest
man
is
artful

hero
is

prudent
a
waverer
tell
me
which
is
the
virtue
among
all
the
virtues
that
human
malice
can
not
vilify
here
finally
is
a
truth
for
all
time
it
is
easy
to
persuade
the
ignorant
still
easier
to
persuade
the
very
wise
but
he
who
hath
a
commencement
of
wisdom
brahma
himself
could
not
cajole
indian
literature
continued
to
be
productive
though
losing
much
of
its
fecundity
until
the
fifteenth
or
sixteenth
century
of
our
era
without
exaggeration
it
is
permissible
to
conject
that
its
scope
extended
over
centuries
it
possesses
the
uniquely
honourable
trait
that
it
is
assuredly
the
only
one
which
owes
nothing
to
any
other
and
is
literally
indigenous

book

race
possessed
a
literature
from
about
it
embodied
in
poems
the
legends
which
had
circulated
among
the
people
since
the
most
remote
epoch
of
their
existence
it
was
those
poems
gathered
later
into
one
collection
which
formed
what
since
approximately
the
year
we
call
the
bible
that
is
the
book
of
books
in
the
bible
there
are
histories
of
the
jews
up
to
the
of
etc
then
anecdotal
episodes
then
books
of
moral
philosophy
of
then
books
of
an
oratorical
and
lyrical
character
of
and
all
the
finally
a
single
work
still
lyrical
but
in
which
there
are
marked
traces
of
the
dramatic
type
the
of
the
to
the
works
which
have
been
gathered
into
the
bible
it
is
necessary
to
add
the
talmud
a
collection
of
commentaries
on
the
civil
and
religious
laws
of
the
jews
which
forms
an
indispensable
supplement
to
the
bible
to
anyone
desiring
to
understand
the
hebraic
civilisation
the
the
gospels
published
in
the
greek
tongue
have
nothing
hebraic
except
that
they
were
compiled
by
jews
or
by
their
immediate
disciples
and
that
they
have
preserved
something
of
the
manner
of
writing
of
the
jews
biblical
the
biblical
writings
regarded
solely
from
the
literary
point
of
view
form
one
of
the
finest
monuments
of
human
thought
the
sentiment
of
grandeur
and
even
of
infinity
in
the
profound
and
simple
sensibility
as
in
the
of
and
eloquence
and
exquisite
religious
sentiment
as
in
the
of
and
the
of
ecstatic
lyricism
vehement
and
fiery
accompanied
with
incredible
satiric
force
as
in
the
wisdom
alike
equal
to
that
of
the
stoics
and
of
the
serious
epicureans
as
in
and
the
everywhere
marvellous
imagination
always
concise
at
least
if
not
restrained
lyrical
sensuality
which
recalls
the
most
perturbed
creations
of
erotic
greeks
and
latins
whilst
surpassing
them
in
beauty
as
in
the
of
and
throughout
there
is
this
grandeur
this
simple
majesty
this
easy
and
natural
sublimity
which
in
the
same
degree
is
to
be
found
only
occasionally
in
homer
and
which
appears
to
be
the
privilege
of
the
people
who
were
the
first
to
believe
in
a
single
god
that
is
what
makes
almost
in
a
continuous
way
the
astonishing
beauty
of
the
bible
and
which
explains
how
whole
nations
of
other
origin
have
made
down
to
our
own
day
and
still
continue
to
make
the
bible
their
uninterrupted
study
and
draw
from
it
courage
serenity
exaltation
of
soul
and
a
singular
ferment
of
their
poetic
and
literary
genius
as
has
been
the
case
with
many
other
literary
monuments
it
is
possible
without
owning
that
it
is
desirable
that
the
bible
may
even
survive
the
numerous
and
important
religions
which
have
been
born
from
it

the
most
ancient
greek
writer
known
is
homer
and
it
can
not
be
absolutely
stated
in
what
epoch
he
lived
since
the
seventeenth
century
it
has
even
been
asked
if
he
ever
existed
and
if
his
poems
are
not
collections
of
epic
songs
which
had
circulated
in
ancient
greece
and
which
at
a
very
recent
epoch
that
of
pisistratus
had
been
gathered
into
two
grand
consecutive
poems
thanks
to
some
rearrangement
and
editing
at
the
commencement
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
erudite
were
generally
agreed
that
homer
had
never
existed
now
they
are
reverting
to
the
belief
that
there
were
only
two
homers
one
the
author
of
the
and
the
other
of
the
the
the
is
the
story
of
the
wrath
of
achilles
of
his
retreat
far
from
his
friends
who
were
endeavouring
to
capture
troy
and
of
his
return
to
them
it
is
the
poem
of
patriotism
it
is
filled
with
the
spirit
that
when
a
people
is
divided
against
itself
all
misfortunes
fall
on
and
overwhelm
it
achilles
unjustly
offended
deprived
his
of
his
support
they
are
all
on
the
point
of
perishing
he
returns
to
them
in
order
to
avenge
the
death
of
his
dearest
friend
and
they
are
saved
the
is
almost
entirely
filled
with
battles
which
are
very
skillfully
diversified
some
episodes
such
as
the
farewell
of
hector
to
his
wife
andromache
when
he
quits
her
for
the
fight
or
king
priam
coming
in
tears
to
ask
achilles
for
the
corpse
of
his
son
hector
that
he
may
piously
inter
it
are
among
the
most
beautiful
passages
that
ever
came
from
a
human
inspiration
the
the
is
also
the
poem
of
patriotism
of
the
of
the
native
land
it
is
the
story
of
ulysses
after
the
siege
of
troy
reconquering
ithaca
the
small
island
of
which
he
is
king
and
taking
ten
years
to
acquire
it
what
makes
the
unity
of
the
poem
what
forms
the
backbone
of
the
poem
is
the
smoke
which
rises
above
the
house
of
ulysses
which
he
always
perceives
in
the
dream
of
his
hopes
and
desires
which
invincibly
attracts
him
which
he
desires
to
see
again
before
he
dies
and
the
thought
of
which
sustains
him
in
his
trials
and
causes
him
to
scorn
all
joys
on
his
road
thither
the
thousand
adventures
of
ulysses
his
sojourn
with
the
nymph
calypso
his
terrible
perils
in
the
cave
of
the
giant
polyphemus
and
near
the
isle
of
the
sirens
the
tempests
which
he
survives
the
hospitality
he
receives
from
king
alcinoüs
the
visit
he
pays
to
the
dead
among
whom
is
achilles
regretting
the
earth
and
preferring
to
be
a
ploughman
among
the
living
rather
than
king
among
the
dead
these
are
vigorous
curious
interesting
touching
picturesque
scenes
from
which
all
subsequent
literatures
have
drawn
inspiration
and
which
still
delight
all
races
posterior
very
probably
to
homer
hesiod
has
left
two
great
poems
one
on
the
families
of
the
gods
and
the
other
on
the
works
of
man
and
the
is
very
valuable
to
us
because
we
learn
from
it
and
it
makes
us
understand
how
the
greeks
understood
the
divinity
its
different
manifestations
and
so
to
say
its
evolution
through
the
world
and
is
a
poem
filled
with
both
sadness
and
courage
the
author
finding
the
world
wicked
and
men
unjust
but
always
concluding
that
with
energy
perseverance
and
obstinacy
it
is
possible
to
save
oneself
from
anything
and
that
there
is
only
one
real
misfortune
which
is
to
know
despair
elegiacal
and
lyrical
almost
from
the
most
remote
antiquity
from
the
seventh
century
perhaps
the
eighth
century
before
the
christian
era
the
greeks
possessed
elegiacal
and
lyrical
poets
that
is
to
say
poets
who
put
into
verse
their
personal
sentiments
the
joys
and
sorrows
which
they
felt
as
men
such
were
callinos
the
satiric
archilochus
the
satiric
simonides
of
amorgos
the
martial
tyrtaeus
then
there
were
the
poets
who
made
verses
to
be
set
to
music
alcaeus
sappho
anacreon
alcman
alcaeus
appears
to
have
been
the
greatest
lyrical
greek
poet
judging
by
the
fragments
we
possess
by
him
and
by
the
lyrical
poems
of
horace
which
there
are
reasons
for
believing
were
imitated
from
alcaeus
of
the
poetess
sappho
we
have
too
little
to
enable
us
to
judge
her
very
exactly
but
throughout
antiquity
she
enjoyed
a
glory
equal
to
that
of
the
greatest
she
specially
sang
of
love
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
lead
to
the
belief
that
she
herself
had
not
escaped
the
passion
anacreon
sang
after
the
same
fashion
and
with
a
charm
a
grace
a
witty
ingenuity
which
are
fascinating
he
was
the
epicurean
of
poetry
before
the
birth
of
epicurus
and
from
him
was
born
a
type
of
literature
known
as
anacreonotic
which
extended
right
through
ancient
times
and
has
been
prolonged
to
modern
times
prose
finally
prose
was
born
in
the
sixth
century
before
christ
with
the
philosophers
thales
heraclitus
anaxagoras
and
with
the
historians
of
whom
only
one
of
that
epoch
has
remained
famous
namely
herodotus
herodotus
in
a
general
history
of
his
own
time
and
of
that
immediately
preceding
it
is
often
not
far
from
epic
poetry
his
style
is
at
once
limpid
and
warm
he
possesses
a
pleasing
power
of
distinction
the
taste
for
and
curiosity
about
the
manners
of
foreign
peoples
a
laughing
and
easy
imagination
without
any
pretence
at
the
philosophy
of
history
or
of
moralising
through
history
he
was
above
all
a
delightful
writer
to
this
period
albeit
somewhat
at
hazard
it
is
possible
to
ascribe
aesop
about
whom
nothing
is
known
except
that
he
wrote
the
fables
which
have
been
imitated
from
generation
to
generation
the
collection
that
we
possess
under
his
name
is
one
of
these
imitations
perpetrated
long
after
his
death
but
as
to
which
it
is
impossible
to
assign
a
date
pindar
the
theban
broadened
and
extended
the
lyrical
type
under
him
it
preserved
its
power
its
high
spirits
its
verse
and
so
to
say
its
fine
fury
but
he
introduced
into
the
epic
the
narration
of
ancient
legends
the
acts
and
gestures
of
the
ancient
heroes
and
effected
this
so
admirably
that
the
most
lyrical
of
grecian
lyricists
is
an
historian
capable
of
sustained
elevation
of
sublime
thoughts
and
expressions
of
a
fine
disorder
which
has
been
overpraised
and
which
on
close
expression
is
found
to
be
very
careful
he
has
been
regarded
as
the
very
type
of
dignified
and
poetic
style
and
more
or
less
to
be
imitated
by
all
ambitious
poets
commencing
with
ronsard
the
wise
like
horace
have
contented
themselves
with
praising
him
from
fragments
left
to
us
he
is
infinitely
impassioned
to
read
greek
greek
tragedy
which
is
one
of
the
miracles
of
the
human
brain
began
in
the
sixth
century
it
was
born
of
the
dithyramb
the
dithyramb
is
a
chant
in
chorus
in
honour
of
a
god
or
a
hero
from
this
chorus
emerged
a
single
actor
who
sang
the
praises
of
the
god
and
to
which
the
choir
replied
when
instead
of
one
actor
there
were
two
who
addressed
one
another
in
dialogue
and
were
answered
by
the
choir
the
dramatic
poem
was
founded
when
there
were
three
and
there
were
hardly
ever
any
more
tragedy
as
the
greeks
understood
it
existed
thespis
aeschylus
thespis
was
the
earliest
known
to
us
who
took
rudimentary
tragedies
from
town
to
town
in
attica
then
came
aeschylus
whose
tragedy
already
rigid
and
hieratical
was
very
powerful
imbued
with
terrible
majesty
then
came
sophocles
a
religious
philosopher
having
a
feeling
for
the
old
religion
and
the
art
of
giving
it
a
moral
character
great
lyrical
poet
master
of
dialogue
eloquent
moving
knowing
how
to
construct
and
carry
on
a
dramatic
poem
with
infinite
skill
to
whom
in
fact
can
be
denied
no
quality
of
dramatic
poetry
and
who
attains
a
conception
of
perfection
euripides
less
religious
as
a
philosopher
sometimes
suggesting
the
sophist
and
a
little
the
rhetorician
but
full
of
ideas
eloquent
affecting
the
most
tragic
that
is
the
most
pathetic
of
all
the
acting
dramatists
as
aristotle
observed
the
most
modern
too
and
the
one
we
best
understand
has
been
the
true
source
whence
have
been
freely
drawn
the
tragedies
of
modern
times
more
particularly
of
our
own
the
greatest
works
of
aeschylus
are
against
and
the
greatest
of
sophocles
the
and
at
the
greatest
of
euripides
and
after
euripides
tragedy
was
exhausted
and
only
produced
very
works
comedy
enjoyed
a
longer
existence
very
obscure
in
origin
no
doubt
proceeding
from
the
opprobrious
jests
exchanged
by
the
lower
classes
in
mirthful
hours
it
was
at
first
freely
fantastical
composed
in
dialogue
oratorical
lyrical
satirical
even
epical
at
times
like
tragedy
it
possessed
a
chorus
for
which
the
lyrical
part
was
specially
reserved
it
was
personal
that
is
it
directly
attacked
known
contemporaries
often
by
name
and
often
by
bringing
them
on
the
stage
the
celebrated
authors
of
this
ancient
comedy
were
eupolis
cratinos
of
whom
we
have
only
fragments
and
aristophanes
whose
work
has
come
down
to
us
aristophanes
was
a
great
poet
with
incisive
humour
and
also
incomparable
lyrical
power
with
voluntary
vulgarity
which
is
often
shocking
and
an
elevation
of
ideas
and
language
which
frequently
raise
him
to
the
heights
of
aeschylus
and
sophocles
here
was
one
of
the
grandest
poetic
minds
that
the
world
has
produced
his
most
considerable
achievements
are
the
earliest
known
work
of
literary
criticism
in
dramatic
form
too
wherein
he
sets
up
a
parallel
between
aeschylus
and
euripides
and
cruelly
jeers
at
the
latter
in
which
he
mocks
the
sophists
wherein
he
ridicules
the
athenian
mania
for
judging
and
magnificently
praises
the
old
athenians
of
the
time
of
marathon
to
this
ancient
comedy
immediately
succeeded
the
middle
comedy
in
which
it
was
forbidden
to
introduce
personalities
and
of
which
aristophanes
gave
an
example
and
a
model
in
his
later
in
the
fourth
century
before
christ
with
the
refined
witty
and
discreet
menander
the
new
comedy
was
analogous
to
that
of

spoke
to
mankind
through

of

the

were
zeno

cleanthes
chrysippus

an
austere
morality
which
may
be
summed
up
in
these
words
abstain

endure
the
epicureans
whose
chief
representatives
were
epicurus
and
aristippus

when
all
was
taken
into

the

morality

starting
from
a

principle

was
that
happiness

in

of
this
principle
they
advised
less
austerity
even
in
their
precepts
although
these
are
schools
of
philosophy
yet
they
must
be
taken
into
account
here
because
each
of
them
has
exercised
much
influence
over
writers
the
first
on
seneca
and
much
later
on

this
was

from

rose
a

have
found
an
ancient
inscription
proving
that
the

of
ancient
greece
were
kings
of
the
land
deified
after
death
an
ingenious
invention
from
which
was
to
come
a
whole
school
of
criticism
of
ancient
mythology
the
elegy
and
idyll
true
and
at
the
same
time
great
poets
belonged
to
this
period
one
was

elegiac
and

short
elegies
those
preserved
to
us
are
charming
yet
another
was
the
sad
and
charming
leonidas
of
tarentum
the
two
leaders
of
this
choir
were
theocritus
and
callimachus
theocritus
a
sicilian
passes
as
the
founder
of
the
idyll
which
he
did
not
invent
but
to
which
he
gave
the
importance
of
a
type
by
marking
it
with
his
imprint
the
idyll
of
theocritus
was
always
a
picture
of
popular
customs
and
even
a
little
drama
of
popular
morals
but
at
times
it
had
its
scene
set
in
the
country
at
others
in
a
town
or
again
by
the
sea
and
consequently
there
are
rustic
idylls

maritime
idylls
popular
urban
idylls
an
astonishing
sense
of
reality
united
to
a
personal
poetic
gift
and
a
highly
alert
sensitiveness
made
his
little
poems
alike
beautiful
for
their
truth
and
also
for
a
certain
ideal
of
ardent
and
profound
passion
it
is
curious
without
being
astonishing
that
the
idyll
of
theocritus
often
suggests
the
poetry
of
the
bible
pupils
of
moschus
and
bion
were
the
immediate
pupils
of
theocritus
he
had
more
illustrious
ones
commencing
with
virgil
in
his
continuing
with
the
numerous
idylls
of
the
renaissance
in
france
and
italy
as
well
as
with
segrais
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
ending
if
it
be
desired
with
andré
chénier
though
others
more
modern
can
be
traced
callimachus
more
erudite
more
scholastic
was
what
is
termed
a
neoclassic
which
is
that
he
desired
to
treat
in
a
new
way
the
same
subjects
that
had
been
dealt
with
by
the
great
men
of

possible

kind
of

in
which
secondary

perhaps
a
novel
type
but
more
probably
imitated
from
certain
poems
of

which
we
no

possess

us
his
poetry
seems
cold
and
calculated
although
clever

of
writing
an

like

but
also
of
restoring
the

and
he
had
a
violent
quarrel
on

his

it
was
a
fine

an
astonishing
psychological
poem

of

a
masterpiece
assuredly
virgil
in

and
perhaps
racine
in

he
left
such
an
admirable

that
is
cassandra
that
his
contemporaries
themselves
failed
to
understand
it
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
he
is
the
head
and
ancestor
of
that
great
school
of
inaccessible
or
impenetrable
poets
who
are
most
ardently
admired
maurice
scève
in
the
sixteenth
century
is
the
illustrious
example
the
epigrammatists
to
these
numerous
men
of
great
talent
must
be
added
the
epigrammatists
that
is
those
who
wrote
very
short
very
concise
very
limpid
poems
wherein
they
sought
absolute
perfection
they
were
almost
innumerable
the
most
illustrious
was

in
whom
we
can
yet
appreciate
delicate
genius
and
exquisite
sensibility
reduced
to
roman
provinces
successively

greece

the

none
the
less
continued
to
be
an
admirable
intellectual
haven
as
early
as
the
punic
wars
the
greek
polybius
revealed
he
was
an
excellent
historian
military
political
and
philosophical
inquisitive
about
facts
inquisitive
too
about
probable
causes
constitutions
and
social
institutions
the
morals
character
and
the
underlying
temperament
of

his
principal
work
is
the
that
is
the
history
of
the
world
from
the
second
punic
war
until
the
capture
of
corinth
by
the
romans
he
was
an
intellectual
master
unfortunately
he
wrote
very
badly
epictetus

it
must
however
be
recognised
that
in
the
first
century
before
christ
and
in
the
first
after
greece
even
intellectually
was
in
a
state
of
depression
but
dating
from
the
emperor
nerva
that
is
from
the
commencement
of
the
second
century
there
was
a
remarkable
hellenic
revival
primarily
it
was
the
most
brilliant
moment
since
plato
in
grecian
philosophy
stoicism
exerted
complete
sway
over
the
cultivated
classes
epictetus
gave
his
and
wherein
are
condensed
the
elevated
and

that

nickname
given
to

because
of

is
penetrated
with
the

a
little
mingled
with
platonism
which
makes
him
therefore
perhaps
penetrate
more
easily
than
the
pure
stoics
plutarch
as

discreetly
romantic
as
philosophical
moralist
decidedly
dexterous
gently
obstinate
in

in
a
large

of

narrated
those
of
illustrious
romans
and
greeks
to
show
how
excellent
they
were
and
how
highly
they
ought
to
esteem
one
another
elsewhere
in
his
moral
works
he
sought
to
conciliate
philosophy
and
paganism
no
doubt
believing
in
a
single
god
as
did
plato
but
also
believing
in
a
crowd
of
intermediary
spirits
between
god
and
man
which
allowed
him
to
regard
the
deities
of
paganism
as
misunderstood
beings
and
even
in
a
certain
sense
to
admit
their
authority
emphatically
a
man
who
observed
the
golden
mean
he
opposed
the
stoics
for
being
too
severe
on
human
nature
and
the
epicureans
for
being
too
easy
or
for
too
lightly
risking
the
future
he
was
an
elegant
writer
gracious
nearer
all
said
and
done
to
eclecticism
than
to
simplicity
and
he
must
not
be
judged
by
the
geniality
which
was
virtually
imparted
to
him
by
amyot
in
translating
him
throughout
europe
since
the
renaissance
of
all
the
grecian
authors
he
has
perhaps
been
the
most
read
the
most
quoted
the
best
loved
and
the
most
carefully
edited
the
greek
greek
historians

about
this
period
to
mention
only
the
most
notable
arrian
philosopher

of
epictetus
and
historian
of

expedition
of

wrote

history
of
the

their
origin
until
the
time

a
little
artificial

historian
of
a
highly
individualistic
character
was
diogenes
of
laertius
who
wrote
the

being
very
little
of
a
philosopher
himself
and
too
prone
to
drop
into
anecdotage
but
interesting
and
invaluable
to
us
because
of
the
scanty
information
we
possess
about
ancient
philosophy
immeasurably
superior
to
those
just
cited

be
regarded
as

and

fashion

most
diverse
subjects

these
were
almost
all

a
fiery
and
impassioned

termed
by
his
admirers
the
great
without
there
being
much
hyperbole
in
the
qualification
was
an
incomparable
orator
he
as
it
were
reigned
over
eastern
christianity
thanks
to
his
word
his
skill
and
his
courage
even
to
us
his
works
possess
charm
he
intermingled
the
finest
ideas
of
plato
and
of
christianity
in
the
happiest
and
most
orthodox
manner
the
humanists
held
him
in
esteem
for
having
rendered
justice
to
antiquity
in
his
on
profane
and
having
advised
christians
to
study
it
with
prudence
but
with
esteem
saint
gregory
of
nazianzen
the
intimate
friend
of
saint
basil
was
also
a
great
orator
exalted
ardent
and

he
was
also
as
a
poet
refined
gracious
and
full
of
charm

of

essentially
a
theologian

in
his
day
a
theological
authority
saint
john
the
most
splendid
figure
of
the
greek
church
was
saint
john
chrysostom
celebrated
in
political
history
for
his
struggle
with
the
emperor
arcadius
and
the
empress
eudoxia
and
for
the
persecutions
he
had
in
consequence
to
suffer
his
heated
fiery
and
violent
eloquence
which
was
altogether
that
of
a
tribune
of
the
people
can
still
profoundly
affect
us
because
therein
can
be
felt
a
deeply
sincere
ardour
a
passion
for
justice
charity
and
love
a
bellicose
moralist
he
was
like
bourdaloue
a
realist
and
therefore
an
exact
and
cruel
delineator
of
the
customs
of
his
time
which
were
not
good
and
he
teaches
us
better
than
anyone
else
what
was
the
sad
state
of
eastern
morality
in
his
day
his
widely
varied
genius
passing
from
the
most
spiritually
familiar
of
tones
to
the
height
of
moving
and
imposing
eloquence
was
one
of
the
grandest
of
all
antiquity
allusion
should
be
made
to
that
good
historian
eusebius
who
narrated
christian
history
from
its
origins
until
the
year
the
byzantine
what
is
termed
the
byzantine
period
extended
from
the
close
of
the
reign

to
the
definite
fall
of
the
eastern

this
long
epoch
practically
corresponding
to
the

of

always
poured
into
the

at

a
portion
of

roman

only
at
the
moment
when
the
romans
came
into
contact
with
the
greeks
read
their
works
and
were
tempted
to
imitate
them
that
is
to
say
it
commences

the

was

what

marked
first
by
an
energetic
patriotic
sentiment
which
affords
pleasure
then
it
possesses
energy
and
sometimes
even
a
certain
brilliance
in
addition
ennius
wrote
several
didactic
and
satiric
poems
among
the

ennius
was
the
great
ancestor
and
father
of
latin
literature
lucilius
was
a
satirist
judging
by
the
fragments
of
his
work
which
have
come
down
to
us
he
was
a
very
acute
and
penetrating
political
satirist
horace
despite
his
sovereign
disdain
for
all
that
preceded
his
own
century
did
not

value
him

there
was

to
be
drawn
and

at
this

it
may
be
apposite
here
to
point
out
that
it
was
later
and
in
the
finest
period
of
latin
literature
that
they
ceased
to
exist
plautus
conceived
the
plan
of
transporting
to
rome
grecian
comedies
of
the
time
of
the
new
comedy
and
of
adapting
them
more
or
less
to
latin
morals
he
possessed
a
strong
and
brutal
verve
which

not

power

it

if

stage
however
the
roman
writers
held
him
in
great
esteem
and
at
one
epoch
of
our
own
history
in
the
seventeenth
century
he
enjoyed
remarkable
and
unanimous
appreciation
to

strictly
defined

it
dealt
with

added
the

came
to
them

endeavoured
to
raise
this

standard
and
succeeded
it
then
became
a
thoroughly
national
characteristic
there
was
considerable
analogy
between
it
and
the
modern
popular
italian
comedy
showing
its
cassandras
its
pantaloon

its
harlequin
without
it
being
possible
to
assert
that
the
italian
comedy
proceeded
from
the
atellane
the
atellane
enjoyed
much
success
in
the
second
century
before
christ
it
was
however
ousted
by
the
mime
which
was
the
kind
of
comic
literature
thoroughly
national
at
rome
the
mime
was
a
farce
of
popular
morals
particularly
of
the
lower
classes
it
was
a
portrayal
of
the
dregs
of
society
in
their
comic
aspects
it
maintained
its
sway
until
the
close
of
the
roman
empire
without
becoming
more
dignified
rather
the
reverse
the
names
of
some
authors
of
mimes
have
survived
publius
syrus
and
laberius
in
the
time
of
caesar
what
is
curious
is
that
these
mimes
licentious
and
even
obscene
though
they
were
throughout
gave
occasional
utterance
to
highly
moral
observations
which
latin
grammarians
have
preserved
for
us
this
curious
mixture
may
be
explained
or
contrasted
at
pleasure
perhaps
it
was
only
a
conventional
habit
as
for
what
there
was
of
tragedy
it
was
destined
to
be
yet
than
comedy
but
it
was
evidently
very
brilliant
and
it
is
regrettable
that
it
has
not
been
preserved
livius
andronicus
and
nasvius
wrote
tragedies
but
the
three
greatest
tragedians
were
ennius
his
nephew
pacuvius
and
attius
ennius
imitated
euripides
pacuvius
sophocles
and
attius
aeschylus
all
three
soared
to
the
grand
the
majestic
and
the
sublime
all
seem
to
have
been
very
sententious
and
replete
with
maxims
but
it
is
needful
to
be
cautious
these
authors
are
known
to
us
only
by
the
citations
made
by
grammarians
and
grammarians
who
having
naturally
cited
phrases
rather
than
fragments
of
dialogue
make
it
possible
that
these
authors
appear
to
us
sententious
when
they
were
in
reality
not
abnormally
so
prose
prose
literature
at
rome
appeared
almost
at
the
same
time
as
the
poetic
cicero
has
given
us
the
names
of
great
orators
contemporaries
of
ennius
and
there
were
historians
and
didacticians
in
prose
of
the
same
period
the
elder
cato
the
great
censor
was
an
historian
he
wrote
a
work
which
seems
to
have
been
the
history
not
only
of
rome
but
of
all
italy
since
the
foundation
of
rome
he
was
didactic
he
wrote
a
re
on
rural
life
which
has
come
down
to
us
and
is
infinitely
valuable
as
showing
the
simplicity
the
hardness
and
the
avarice
of
the
old
roman
proprietors
all
qualities
which
cato
thoroughly
well
knew
they
possessed
the
age
of
the
age
of
caesar
was
a
great
literary
epoch
before
all
and
almost
over
all
was
caesar
himself
great
orator
grammarian
and
historian
his
that
is
his
memoirs
history
of
his
campaigns
are
admirable
in
their
conciseness
and
precision
of
rapid
and
running
narrative
apart
from
him
cornelius
nepos
made
a
very
clear
abridgment
characterised
by
marked
sobriety
of
universal
history
under
the
title
of
varro
a
kind
of
encyclopaedist
wrote
a
re
also
a
work
on
the
latin
language
satires
it
is
true
but
mixtures
of
prose
and

and
a
work
on
as
well
as
a
crowd
of
small
books
dealing
with
every
possible
subject
cicero
told
him
you
have
taught
us
all
things
human
and
divine
he
possessed
immense
erudition
and
a
violent
mind
not
without
charm
he
can
be
imagined
as
a
sage
of
our
own
sixteenth
century
cicero
was
perhaps
the
greatest
that
has
ever
lived
it
is
obvious
that
all
tastes
were
in
his
soul
at
the
same
time
as
voltaire
said
of
himself
and
he
gratified
them
all
he
was
politician
lawyer
orator
poet
philosopher
professor
of
rhetoric
moralist
grammarian
political
writer
correspondent
he
encompassed
all
human
knowledge
involved
himself
in
all
human
matters
and
was
a
very
great
writer
what
interests
us
most
in
his
immense
output
are
his
political
discourses
his
letters
and
his
moral
treatises
his
political
discourses
are
those
of
an
honest
man
who
always
held
upright
views
and
the
sentiment
of
the
great
interests
of
his
country
his
letters
are
those
of
a
witty
man
and
of
an
excellent
friend
his
moral
treatises
more
particularly
his
on
duties
are
in
a
very
elevated
spirit
which
subordinates
all
other
human
duties
beneath
obligations
towards
one
country
he
did
not
always
rise
to
circumstances
he
was
well
content
on
the
contrary
that
they
should
serve
him
sallust
who
as
an
individual
seems
to
have
been
contemptible
was
a
highly
sagacious
and
excellent
historian
he
has
left
a
history
of
catiline
and
another
of
jugurtha
they
are
masterpieces
of
lucidity
and
of
dramatic
vivacity
admirable
especially
are
his
maxims
which
seem
as
well
thought
out
as
those
of
la
rochefoucauld
friendship
is
to
desire
the
same
things
and
to
hate
the
same
things
the
spirit
of
faction
is
the
friendship
of
scoundrels
poetry
poetry
was
not
less
brilliant
than
prose
in
the
time
of
caesar
it
was
the
era
of
lucretius
and
of
catullus
catullus
a
delightful
man
of
the
world
a
charming
voluptuary
passionate
and
eloquent
lover
formidable
epigrammatist
a
little
coloured
by
alexandrianism
but
barely
for
this
trait
has
been
much
exaggerated
comes
very
close
to
being
a
great
poet
in
many
respects
he
closely
recalls
andré
chénier
who
it
may
be
added
was
thoroughly
conversant
with
his
writing
lucretius
is
a
very
noble
poet
if
we
knew
epicurus
otherwise
than
by
fragments
it
is
highly
probable
we
should
be
tempted
to
assert
that
lucretius
was
only
a
translator
but
on
that
we
can
not
pronounce
and
of
the
didactic
part
of
the
poem
of
lucretius
even
if
it
were
a
simple
translation
all
the
oratorical
and
the
descriptive
portions
would
remain
and
they
are
the
most
beautiful
of
the
work
in
his
invocations
to
epicurus
in
his
prosopopoeia
of
nature
to
man
inviting
resignation
to
death
in
his
descriptions
of
the
immolation
of
iphigenia
and
of
the
cow
wandering
in
the
fields
in
search
of
her
lost
heifer
there
are
a
breadth
a
grasp
and
an
epic
grandeur
which
recall
homer
arouse
thoughts
of
dante
and
which
virgil
himself
whilst
much
less
unequal
though
never
greater
has
not
attained
the
augustan
the
augustan
age
which
was
only
really
very
great
if
under
this
title
is
also
included
the
epoch
of
caesar
and
also
that
of
octavius
and
thus
it
was
understood
by
our
ancestors
does
not
fail
to
offer
writers
of
fine
genius
these
are
virgil
horace
and
who
is
one
of
the
purest
and
most
beautiful
writers
and
an
orator
of
seductive
talent
in
his
own
chamber
wrote
a
roman
history
composed
as
to
the
first
portion
of
the
legends
transmitted
at
rome
from
generation
to
generation
and
in
which
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
distinguish
the
false
from
the
true
for
of
the
work
made
very
accurate
investigations
of
all
that
previous
historians
and
the
annals
of
the
pontiffs
could
give
the
author
as
has
been
observed
being
a
cisalpine
was
a
gaul
who
already
possessed
the
french
qualities

sustained
and
careful
style
oratorical
tastes
an
ardent
patriot
republican
at
his
soul
yet
treated
in
friendly
fashion
by
augustus
he
wrote
roman
history
at
first
no
doubt
to
make
it
known
but
above
all
to
inspire
the
romans
of
his
own
time
with
admiration
respect
and
love
for
the
austere
morals
and
exalted
virtues
of
their
ancestors
he
erected
a
monument
one
portion
of
which
is
unhappily
destroyed
but
into
which
modern
tragedians
have
often
quarried
and
which
orators
have
not
scorned
when
desiring
to
instruct
themselves
in
their
art
virgil
came
from
almost
the
same
country
his
was
a
charming
soul
tender
and
gentle
infinitely
capable
of
friendship
very
pure
and
white
as
horace
said
with
a
tendency
to
melancholy
the
two
sources
of
his
inspiration
were
homer
and
love
of
rome
add
for
a
time
theocritus
lover
of
the
country
and
of
moral
life
he
first
wrote
those
delicious
wherein
he
did
not
venture
to
be
as
realistic
as
the
sicilian
poet
but
in
which
there
is
not
only
infinite
grace
and
delicate
sensibility
but
also
in
certain
verses
admirable
descriptions
that
arouse
memories
of
those
of
la
fontaine
lover
of
the
soil
and
desirous
in
harmony
with
augustus
to
attract
the
italians
back
to
a
taste
for
agriculture
he
wrote
the
that
is
the
toils
of
the
field
describing
these
labours
with
singular
exactitude
and
precision
then
to
give
the
reader
variety
he
introduced
from
time
to
time
an
episode
which
is
a
fragment
of
history
or
of
mythological
legend
at
length
desirous
of
attributing
to
rome
the
most
glorious
past
possible
he
revived
the
old
legend
which
claimed
that
the
ancient
kings
of
rome
descended
from
the
famous
kings
of
troy
in
her
zenith
and
he
composed
the
the

at
once
both
an
and
an

books
containing
the
adventures
of

the
fall

to
conquer

form
an

the
middle
the
sixth
book
is
a
descent
into
hell
again
an
imitation
of
homer
yet
altogether
new
enriched
as
it
is
with
very
fine
philosophical
ideas
which
homer
could
never
have
known
the
main
theme
of
the
poem
and
what
gives
it
unity
is
rome
which
does
not
yet
exist
but
which
is
always
to
be
seen
looming
in
the
future
all
the
poem
leans
in
that
direction
and
alike
by
ingenious
artifices
by
prophecies

and
more
exact

the
description
of
the
shield

roman
history
itself
in
its
broad
lines

the
sovereign
merit
of

is
his
artistic
sense

are

powerful
or
more
profound
no
man
has
written
better
verse
than
he
on
any
subject
on
which
he
wrote
horace
was
a
man
of
infinite
wit
profoundly
conversant
with
the
grecian
poets
with
that
knowledge
of
the
poets
he
filled
his
odes
with
recollections
of
alcasus
and
stesichorus
they
were
minutely
and
finely
polished
accustoming
the
romans
to
find
in
latin
words
the
musical
phrases
of
the
greeks
but
withal
remaining
very
cold
with
his
wit
his
verve
his
very
lively
sense
of
humour
his
pretty
moral
philosophy
borrowed
a
little
from
the
stoics

mainly
from
the
epicureans

because

a

aptly
john

it
is
not
astonishing
that
the
popularity
of
this

should
have
lasted

that

that

to
deal
with
the
theatre
of
the

it
is
necessary
to
go
further
back
without
considering
as
drama
those
pious
performances
which
the
clergy
organised
or
tolerated
even
in
the
churches
from
the
tenth
century
and
probably
earlier
there
was
already
a
popular
drama
in

twelfth

outside

were
performed
veritable
dramas
drawn
from
holy
writ
or
legends
of
saints
this
developed
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
in
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
it
was
prolific
in
immense
dramatic
poems
which
needed
several
days
for
their
performance
these
were
as
they
were
termed

wherein
comedy
and
tragedy
were
interwoven

a
great
deed
in
religious
history

sometimes
in

the
of

the
sixteenth

in

was
ushered
in
by
marot
and
marot
was
a
gracious
fluent
and
satiric
singer
he
was
infinitely
witty
without
venom
or
mannerism
or
affectation
at
times
he
attained
to
a
somewhat
serious
philosophic
poesy
and
also
to
eloquence

he
was
most
emphatically
of
all
those
who
have
ever
been

placed
by
his
contemporaries
above
marot
and
literary
historians

left
him
for
the
most

in

position
the
truth
is
that
his
work
is
worthless
it
would
be
impossible
however
to
rob

to
him
the
the
second
half
of

in

the
more
remarkable
in

there
was
the

the
true

marot

give

had
produced

did

created
an
epic
poem
which
it
is
impossible
to
read

some
rather
overpowering
odes
after
the
pindaric
manner
but
he
wrote
detached
epic
pieces
which
though
always
a
trifle
artificial
possess
real
beauty
and
some
which
are
enchanting
in
their
grace
and
genuineness
of
feeling
as
well
as
sonnets

are
in
all
respects
marvellous

even
when
they
imitated

to
the
school

who
knew
how
to
write
in

make
a

the

poets

great
prose
writers
were
then
crowded
in
serried
ranks
to
begin
with
the
dramatic

furnished
the
most
vivid
glory
of
the
epoch
there
was
corneille
who
from
with

in
full
splendour

who
before

produced

most
beautiful
works

years

furnish

possessed

fine
qualities

corneille
must
be
regarded
as
the
real
creator
of

french
drama
because
he
wrote
comedies
tragedies
operas
melodramas
it
was
therein
apart
from
his
universal
virtuosity
that
he
more
particularly
made
his
mark
and
in
his
best
work
he
was
the
delineator
of
the
human
will
overcoming
passions
and
as
it
were
intoxicated
with
this
victory
and
his
own
power
so
that
he

become

great
advocate
of
energy
and
a
prominent
apostle
of

being

of

taste
who
wrote

industriously
this
was
not

to
constitute
a

enough
to
make
him
what
he
was
a
diverting

acute
satirist
an

instructed
and
sometimes
profound
he
had
a
gentle
and
smiling
sensibility
capable
at
times
of
melancholy

also

again
of

of

it
is

state
what

to

with
which

to
the

to
him

the

against

which
have
often
been
regarded
as
the
foremost
monument
of
classic
french
prose
such
is
not
our
view
but
they
certainly
form
a
masterpiece
of
argument
of
dialectics
of
irony
of
humour
of
eloquence
and
are
throughout
couched
in
a
magnificent
style
dying

young

notes
on

subjects

particularly
religion
philosophy
and
morality
which
have
been
collected
under

are
the
product
of
a
great
christian
philosopher
of
a
profound
moralist
of
a
marvellously
concise
orator
and
also
of
a
poet
who
lacked

sensitiveness
nor

imposing
imagination
bossuet
is
universally
admitted
to
be
the
king
of
french
orators
all
his
life
he
preached
with
a
serious

copious
and
sonorous
eloquence
fed
from
recollections
of
holy
writ

of

those
he
regarded
as
enemies

religion
of
of

works

and
exalted
eloquence
he
traced
in
his
the
great
design
in
all
its
stages
of
god
towards
humanity
and
the
world
he
knew
all
the
resources
of
the
french
language
and
of
french
style
and
in
his
hands
they
were
expanded
despite
his
errors
which
were
those
of
his
epoch
his
date
counts
in
the
history
of
france
as
a
great
date
the
date
in
which
the
religion
to
which
he
belonged
reached
its
apogee
and
when
the
grand
style
of
french
prose
was
in
its
zenith
madame

madame

wrote
letters
to
her
friends

they
were
so
witty

admirable
in
aptly
recounting
the
anecdotes
of
her
day
and
in
depicting
the
scenes
and
those
concerned
in

written
in
a
style
so
brisk
and
seductive
uniting
the
promise
of
with
the
harvest
of
that
her
work
still
remains
one
of
the
greatest

of

a

and
the
country
he
was
on
the
lookout
for
fools
in

to
be
their
scourge
he
painted
or
better
still
he
engraved
in
an
incisive
way
that
was
sharp
like
almost
invariably
bitter
to
an
extreme
he
sometimes
had
flashes
of
quite
unexpected
and
very
singular
sensibility
which
make
him
beloved
somewhat
in
imitation
of
la
rochefoucauld
but
more
particularly
in
conformity
with
his
own
nature
he
developed
a
brief
concise
brusque
style
which
became
that
of
the
moralist
and
even
of
the
general
author
for
the
next
fifty
years
a
style
which
was
that
of
montesquieu
and
voltaire
and
superseded
the
broad
sustained
balanced
harmonious
and
measured
style
of
the
majority
of
the
writers
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
the
field
of
ridicule
wherein
he
sowed
copiously
more
so
even
than
molière
the
comic
poets
of
the
eighteenth
century
came
to
glean
copiously
which
did
them
less
credit
for
it

better
to
observe
than
to
read
than
it
conferred
on
the
wise
and
ingenious
author
of
the

extremely
individual
and
original
having
on
every
subject
ideas
of
his
own
which
were
sometimes
daring
often
practical
always
generous
and
noble
was
a
preacher
like
bossuet
also
like
bossuet
he
was
a
dexterous
skilled
and
formidable
controversialist
whilst
for
the
instruction
of
the
duke
of
burgundy
which
had
been
confided
to
him
he
became
a
fabulist
an
author
of
dialogues
in
some
degree
a
romancer

epic
poet
in
prose
in
his
famous
overadmired
then
overdepreciated
and
which
despite
weaknesses
remains
replete
with
strength
and
dazzling
brilliance
nowadays
there
is
a
marked
return
to
this
prince
of
the

of

was

italian
literature
indisputably

also
in

the
romancists
and
novelists
of
europe
this
prodigious
producer
who
wrote
millions
of
verses
is
the
homer
of
spain
and
more
fertile
than
homer
whilst
also
a
homer
as
to
whose
existence
there
is
no
doubt
alonso
de
ercilla
created
a
peculiar
species
that
of
memorialist
epic
poems
he
was
a
man
concerned
in
important
events
who
took
daily
notes
and
subsequently
or
even
concurrently
put
them
into
verse
thus
ercilla
made
his
that
is
the
poem
of
the
expedition
against
the
araucanians
in
chili
or
rather
he
thus
wrote
the
first
and
best
of
the
three
parts
later
desirous
of
rising
to
epic
heights
he
had
resort
to
the
contrivances
and
conventional
traditional
ornaments
of
this
type
of
work
and
became
dull
without
entirely
losing
all
his
skill
this
poem
is
more
savage
than
the
nations
which
form
its
theme
said
voltaire
in
a
pretty
phrase
which
was
somewhat
hyperbolical
the
is
agreeably
savage
in
its
first
part
without
being
ferocious
and
fastidiously
civilised
in
the
sequels
without
being
contemptible
hurtado
de
mendoza
must
be
regarded
that
proud
gloomy
bellicose
and
haughty
minister
of
charles
v
because
he
was
the
earliest
of
the
picaresque
romancists
the
picaresque
method
consisted
in
delineating
the
habits
of
outcasts
bohemians
spongers
swindlers
and
vagrants
it
lasted
for
about
three
quarters
of
a
century
to
this
class
belonged

guevara
and
somewhat
in
france
the
of
le
sage
now
the
prototype
of
all
these
was
lazarillo
of
by
hurtado
de
mendoza
a
moment
heed
must
be
paid
to
the
amiable
antonio
de
guevara
an
insinuating
moralist
whose
and
of
though
rather
affectedly
grave
contain
interesting
passages
which
commend
the
author
to
readers
he
is
more
particularly
interesting
to
frenchmen
because
it
was
from
him
la
fontaine
borrowed
his
of
the
attributing
it
to
marcus
aurelius
which
led
to
much
confusion
because
the
principal
personage
in
dial
of
is
one
marcus
aurelius
who
is
discreetly
intended
for
charles
in
spite
of
what
taine
wrote
though
his
criticisms
in
detail
were
accurate
la
fontaine
followed
pretty
closely
the
fine
and
highly
original
wording
of
guevara
the
the
spanish
romance
was
at
its
zenith
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
it
had
a
legion
of
authors
but
here
the
principal
only
can
be
mentioned
montemayor
who
lived
at
the
close
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
led
an
adventurous
existence
wrote
the
in
which
became
celebrated
in
every
country
under
the
title
of
of
montemayor
it
is
a
mythological
bucolic
and
magical
romance
entirely
lacking
in
order
being
wholly
fantastical
sometimes
cruelly
dull
sometimes
graceful
affecting
seductive
and
pathetic
always
ridiculously
romantic
its
vogue
was
considerable
in
spain
france
and
italy
the
of
honoré
proceeds
in
part
from
it
but
is
more
sensible
and
more
restrained
here
quevedo
is
again
found
now
as
prose
writer
and
in
this
no
worse
than
as
poet
he
was
prolific
in
romances
or
satirical
fantasies
in
social
reveries
wherein
contemporary
society
is
not
spared
and
juvenal
is
often
suggested
finally
he
put
forth
all
his
powers
which
were
considerable
in
his
great
romance
pablo
of
which
twenty
years
ago
would
have
been
called
naturalist
quevedo
obviously
was
an
observer
possessed
psychological
penetration
or
at
least
the
wisdom
of
the
moralist
but
above
all
his
imagination
was
curiously
original
he
invented
on
an
apparently
true
foundation
adventures
which
were
almost
probable
and
were
diverting
burlesque
or
possessed
a
bitter
flavour
his
was
one
of
the
most
original
brains
in
spain
which
has
abounded
in
mental
originalities
montesquieu
has
said
of
the
spaniards
they
have
only
one
good
book
the
one
which
mocks
at
all
the
others
nothing
could
be
more
witty
nor
more
unjust
but
it
is
true
that
the
greatest
spanish
book
is
that
in
which
the
author
does
mock
at
many
other
spanish
books
cervantes
wrote
his
to
ridicule
the
romances
of
chivalry
which
in
his
land
were
a
craze
among
the
townsfolk
and
smaller
aristocratic
landowners
but
he
wrote
in
no
spirit
of
animosity
and
even
reserved
for
his
comic
hero
that
is
for
his
victim
a
discreet
sympathy
which
he
made
his
reader
share
a
hero
of
chivalry
himself
warrior
with
indomitable
courage
thrice
wounded
at
the
battle
of
lepanto
where
he
lost
an
arm
seven
years
in
captivity
in
algiers
on
his
return
to
spain
he
became
involved
in
adventures
which
again
consigned
him
to
prison
before
he
at
length
attained
success
if
not
fortune
with
is
a
realistic
romance
traversed
by
a
frenzied
idealist
here
are
the
manners
of
the
populace
of
innkeepers
muleteers
monks
petty
traders
peasants
and
amid
them
passes
a
man
who
views
the
entire
world
as
a
romance
and
who
believes
he
finds
romance
at
every
turn
of
his
road
this
perpetual
contrast
is
first
effective
and
supremely
artistic
in
itself
then
is
of
a
reality
superior
to
that
of
any
realism
since
it
is
the
complete
life
of
humanity
which
is
thus
painted
and
penetrated
to
its
very
foundations
and
shown
in
all
its
aspects
there
are
two
portions
to
this
romance
and
they
are
constantly
near
each
other
and
as
it
were
interlaced
namely
the
episodes
and
the
conversations
the
episodes
comic
incidents
humorous
or
sentimental
adventures
are
of
infinite
variety
and
display
incredible
imagination
the
conversations
between
don
quixote
and
his
faithful
sancho
represent
the
two
tendencies
of
the
human
mind
to
recognise
on
the
one
side
the
goodness
generosity
devotion
the
spirit
of
sacrifice
and
the
illusions
on
the
other
side
common
sense
the
sense
of
reality
the
sense
of
the
just
mean
and
as
it
were
the
proverbial
reason
without
malice
or
bitterness
this
masterpiece
is
perhaps
the
one
for
which
would
have
had
to
be
invented
the
epithet
of
apart
from
his
immortal
romance
cervantes
wrote
novels
romances
sonnets
and
also
tried
the
drama
at
which
he
did
not
succeed
the
whole
world
literally
was
infatuated
with
and
despite
all
changes
of
taste
it
has
never
ceased
to
excite
the
admiration
of
all
who
read
the
drama
ferdinand
de
the
drama
even
apart
from
lope
de
vega
of
whom
we
have
written
was
most
brilliant
in
spain
during
these
two
centuries
the
spanish
stage
was
very
characteristic
very
original
among
all
drama
in
that
more
than
the
ancient
drama
more
than
in
the
plays
of
shakespeare
himself
it
was
essentially
lyrical
or
to
express
the
fact
more
clearly
it
was
based
on
a
continual
mixture
of
the
lyric
and
the
dramatic
also
it
nearly
always
laid
stress
on
the
sentiment
and
the
susceptibility
of
honour
the
point
of
honour
as
it
was
called
and
upon
its
laws
which
were
severe
tyrannical
and
even
cruel
these
two
principal
characteristics
gave
it
a
distinct
aspect
differing
from
all
the
other
european
theatres
without
going
back
to
the
confused
origins
and
without
expressing
much
interest
in
the
spanish
drama
until
the
religious
dramas
of
the
which
continued
their
career
until
the
seventeenth
century
it
is
necessary
first
to
note
at
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
celebrated
of
ferdinand
de
rojas
a
spirited
work
unmeasured
enormous
unequal
at
times
profoundly
licentious
at
times
attaining
a
great
height
of
moral
exaltation
and
also
at
times
farcical
and
at
others
deeply
pathetic
was
translated
several
times
in
various
languages
and
especially
in
italy
and
france
was
as
much
appreciated
as
in
spain
in
the
seventeenth
century
after
lope
de
vega
came
calderon
almost
as
prolific
as
lope
author
of
at
least
two
hundred
plays
some
authorities
say
a
thousand
calderon
was
first
prodigiously
inventive
then
he
was
dogmatic
moralising
almost
a
preacher
whether
in
his
religious
plays
in
his
love
dramas
in
his
cap
and
sword
tragedies
even
in
his
comedies
and
highly
complicated
intrigues
the
great
sentiments
of
the
spanish
soul
honour
faith
the
inviolability
of
the
oath
loyalty
fidelity
the
spirit
of
great
adventures
broaden
animate
and
elevate
the
whole
work
with
calderon
the
titles
are
always
indicative
of
the
subject
his
most
celebrated
plays
are

all
is

and
is
a
devotion
to
the
lady

physician
of
his
own
alarcon

nearer
to
us
owing
to
his
regular
and
almost
classic
compositions
nevertheless
he
was
a
man
of
imagination
and
humour
with
an
adequate
dramatic
force
his
tragedies
must
be
mentioned

his
assert
that
he
wrote
three
hundred
dramas
of
which
are
in
existence
all
spanish
dramatists
were
unequal
he
more
especially
he
passed
from
grossness
to
sublimity
with
surprising
facility
and
ease
he
particularly
delighted
in
ingeniously
complicated
intrigue
in
surprises
and
in
unexpected
theatrical
touches
yet
condemned

and

of

at
the
moment
when

a
time

of

narrated
by
individuals
as
in
virgil
and
as
in
the
spanish
romance
formed
an
internal
supplement
and
thus
was
narrated
almost
all
the
history
of
portugal
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
the
love
of

of

formed
part
of
the
story
of
vasco
da

camoëns
was
a
powerful
narrator
a
magnificent
orator
in
verse
and
above
all
a
very
great
painter
he
evinced
curious
taste
even
as
compared
with
his
contemporaries
such
as
the
continual
commingling
of
mythological
divinities
with
christian
truths
for
instance
a
prayer
addressed
by
vasco
to
jesus
christ
was
granted
by
venus
it
may
also
be
observed
that
the
poem
lacked
unity
and
was
only
a
succession
of
poems
but
as
voltaire
said
the
art
of
relating
details
by
the
pleasure
it
affords
can
make
up
for
all
the
rest
and
that
proves
the
work
to
be
full
of
great
beauties
since
for
two
hundred
years
it
has
formed
the
delight
of
a
clever
race

be
well
aware

its
faults

a
philosophical
poet
or
to
express
it
more
correctly
a
poet
with

he
broke
with
the
eternal
idylls
eclogues
bucolics
and
pastorals
of
his
predecessors
without
declining
to
furnish
excellent
examples
but
more
often
aiming
elsewhere
and
higher
he
also
reformed
the
versification
introducing
metres
employed
in
other
languages
but
hitherto
unused
in
his
tongue
he
wrote
odes

after
the
manner

more
particularly
a

created

must
not
be
regarded
as

as

he

perhaps
the

letters
of
a

so
he
might
be
justly
regarded
as
an

voiture
very
soon
because
he
possessed
the
passion
of
the
eighteenth
century
for
science
and
he
showed
himself
to
be
a
serious
man
and
because
he
had
wit
he
showed
himself
an
amusing
serious
man
which
is
rare
his
of

were
very
humorous
and
at
the

time
in
many
passages
profound
he
wrote

then
because
he
was
perpetual

came

charming
and

astonishing
of
which
ought
to
be
regarded
as
the
best
existent
history
of

in
the
seventeenth

and
in

eighteenth

frenchman
who
lived

a

lexicographer

of
broad
erudition
about
all
earthly
questions
especially
philosophical
and

guiding
his
readers
to
absolute
scepticism
fontenelle
and
bayle
are
the
two
heralds
who
opened
the
procession
of
the
eighteenth
century
successively
must
now
be
examined
first
the
poets
and
then
the
prose
writers
of
the
first
half
of
that
era
la
la
motte
as
celebrated
in
his
own
time
as
he
is
forgotten
in
ours
was
lyricist
fabulist
dramatic
orator
epical
even
after
a
certain
fashion
he
wrote
odes
that
were
deadly
cold
fables
that
were
often
quite
witty
but
affected
and
laboured
comedies
sufficiently
mediocre
of
which
magnificent
was
the
most
remarkable
and
a
tragedy
de
which
was
excellent
and
enjoyed
one
of
the
greatest
successes
of
the
french
stage
finally
becoming
the
partisan
of
the
modernists
against
the
classicists
he
abridged
the
of
homer
into
a
dozen
books
as
frigid
as
his
own
lyric
poems
he
had
parodoxical
ideas
in
literature
and
being
a
poet
or
believing
himself
one
he
considered
that
verse
enervated
thought
and
that
sentiments
should
only
be
written
in
prose
it
was
against
these
tendencies
that
voltaire
so
vigorously
reacted
rousseau
beside
la
motte
being
more
gifted
as
a
poet
jean
baptiste
rousseau
was
conspicuous
he
wrote
lyrical
poems
which
were
cold
as
lyrics
but
were
well
composed
and
sometimes
at
least
attained
a
certain
degree
of
eloquence
from
malherbe
to
lamartine
lyrical
poetry
was
almost
completely
neglected
by
french
poets
or
at
least
very
badly
treated
jean
baptiste
rousseau
had
the
advantage
of
being
nearly
solitary
and
for
approximately
century
was
regarded
as
the
greatest
national
lyrical
poet
le
franc
de
pompignan
has
endured
much
ridicule
not
the
least
being
for
a
certain
naive
vanity
perceptible
directly
he
passed
from
the
south
to
the
north
of
france
but
he
had
some
knowledge
he
was
acquainted
with
hebrew
then
a
sufficiently
rare
accomplishment
and
he
was
an
assiduous
student
of
classic
literature
his
tragedy
succeeded
his
enjoyed
popularity
no
matter
what
voltaire
might
say
and
deserved
their
success
in
his
odes
which
were
too
often
cold
he
rarely
succeeded
only
once
triumphantly
in
his
ode
on
the
death
of
jean
baptiste
rousseau
the
so
far
as
poets
strictly
speaking
were
concerned
the
foregoing
are
all
that
have
to
be
indicated
in
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
except
the
ingenious
and
frigid
of
voltaire
dramatic
to
counterbalance
the
dramatic
poets
are
numerous
and
not
without
merit
let
us
recall
de
by
de
la
motte
campistron
the
feeble
pupil
of
racine
and
moreover
there
could
be
no
pupil
of
racine
so
original
was
the
latter
so
closely
was
his
genius
associated
with
his
mind
perpetrated
numerous
tragedies
and
operas
which
enjoyed
the
success
obtained
by
all
imitative
works
that
is
a
success
which
arouses
no
discussion
and
which
today
appears
to
be
the
climax
of
tediousness
crébillon
followed
vigorous
energetic
violently
shaking
the
nerves
master
of
horror
and
of
terrors
not
lacking
some
analogy
with
shakespeare
but
without
delicacy
or
depth
never
even
giving
a
thought
to
being
psychological
or
a
moralist
writing
badly
and
to
a
certain
extent
meriting
the
epithet
of
the
barbarian
bestowed
on
him
by
voltaire
the
latter
was
infatuated
with
the
drama
having
the
feeling
for
beautiful
themes
and
for
new
and
original
topics
adapting
them
to
the
stage
with
sufficient
aptitude
delighting
in
addition
in
pomp
mimicry
and
decorativeness
and
causing
tragedy
to
lean
towards
opera
which
in
his
day
was
no
bad
thing
but
weak
in
execution
never
creating
characters
because
he
could
not
escape
from
himself
as
moderate
in
psychology
and
morality
as
crébillon
himself
and
replacing
analysis
of
passion
by
these
and
philosophical
commonplaces
he
left
tragic
dramas
which
until
about
enjoyed
success
but
which
then
fell
into
a
disregard
from
which
there
is
no
probability
they
will
ever
emerge
comic
the
comic
poets
of
this
period
were
highly
agreeable
the
most
notable
were
destouches
regnard
la
chaussée
destouches
was
the
very
type
of
the
comic
writers
of
the
eighteenth
century
already
alluded
to
who
took
a
portrait
by
la
bruyère
and
turned
it
into
a
comedy
and
that
is
what
was
called
a
comedy
of
character
thus
he
wrote
etc
sometimes
he
took
pains
to
be
a
trifle
more
original
as
in
false
married
sometimes
he
borrowed
a
subject
from
a
foreign
literature
and
adapted
it
fairly
dexterously
for
the
gallic
stage
as
in
impertinent
taken
from
and
night
borrowed
from
an
english
author
his
versification
was
dexterous
and
correct
without
possessing
other
merit
regnard
on
the
contrary
was
an
original
genius
though
frequently
imitative
of
molière
he
possessed
the
comic
spirit
gaiety
animation
the
sense
of
drollery
and
a
prodigious
capacity
for
humorous
verse
of
great
flexibility
and
incredible
ease
highly
superior
in
point
of
form
to
that
of
boileau
and
even
of
molière
for
he
suggests
a
scarron
perfected
by
molière
himself
and
by
the
italian
poets
still
alive
and
probably
imperishable
are
such
works
as
universal
unexpected
the
drama
la
la
chaussée
possessed
a
vein
of
the
popular
novel
the
serial
as
we
should
say
and
at
the
same
time
a
taste
for
the
stage
the
result
was
he
created
a
new
species
which
in
itself
is
no
small
achievement
he
created
that
is
the
wherein
common
people
and
no
longer
kings
and
princes
affect
us
by
their
misfortunes
this
has
been
called
by
all
possible
names
when
it
is
a
comedy
it
is
described
as
a
tearful
comedy
when
a
tragedy
as
a
dramatic
tragedy
this
is
the
drama
we
have
known
in
france
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
such
as
it
already
existed
in
the
sixteenth
century
under
the
title
of
the
morality
play
such
as
corneille
who
foresaw
everything
anticipated
and
predicted
in
his
preface
to
i
would
rather
say
sir
that
tragedy
should
excite
pity
and
fear
and
that
in
its
essentials
since
there
is
necessity
for
definition
now
if
it
be
true
that
this
latter
feeling
is
only
excited
in
us
when
we
see
those
like
ourselves
suffer
and
that
their
misfortunes
put
us
in
fear
of
similar
calamities
is
it
not
also
true
that
we
can
be
more
strongly
moved
by
disasters
arriving
to
people
of
our
own
rank
having
resemblance
to
ourselves
than
by
the
picture
of
the
overthrow
from
their
thrones
of
the
greatest
monarchs
who
can
have
no
relation
to
us
except
in
so
far
as
we
are
susceptible
to
the
passions
that
overwhelmed
them
which
is
not
always
the
case
this
domestic
tragedy
la
chaussée
wrote
in
verse
which
is
not
against
french
rules
and
which
has
been
done
by
dramatists
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
later
but
it
is
probably
an
error
being
even
more
unlikely
that
citizens
would
express
themselves
in
metre
than
that
kings
and
heroes
should
give
utterance
with
a
certain
solemnity
which
entails
rhythm
thus
he
wrote
fashionable
school
of
very
pathetic
school
of
etc
it
must
be
stated
that
he
wrote
his
plays
in
verse
somewhat
systematically
he
had
made
his
first
appearance
in
literature
by
a
defence
of
versification
against
the
doctrines
of
la
motte
according
to
the
old
system
but
in
original
verse
piron
after
having
met
with
scant
success
in
tragedy
wrote
the
delicious
which
with
of
le
sage
bad
of

masterpieces
of
marivaux
and
the
two

beaumarchais

the

or
eight
superior
comedies

in
the
eighteenth
century
great
prose
writers
in

and
even
great
writers

abundant
at
this
period
immediately
after
fontenelle

bayle
appeared
montesquieu

in

a
great
political
philosopher

master
of
jurisprudence
in
spirit
of
a
great
philosophical
historian
in
grandeur
and
decadence
of
the
the
influence
of
montesquieu
on
voltaire
no
matter
what
the
latter
may
have
said
on
rousseau

have
been
about

men
in

on
the
greatest
minds
of
the
nineteenth
century
has
been
profound
and
difficult
to
measure
as
writer
he
was
concise
collected
and
striking
seeking
the
motive
and
often
finding
it
seeking
the
formula
and
invariably
finding
it
tacitus
mingled
with
sallust
le

in
considering
le
sage
and
it
is
not
perhaps
the
one
who
is
instinctively
thought
of
as
a
novelist
who
really
was
the
greater
romancer
they
each
wrote
at
the
same
time
as
montesquieu
narrated
the
age
of
louis
xiv
as
an
eyewitness
both
with
spirit
and
with
a
feeling
for
the
picturesque
that
were
alike
inimitable
expressed

a
highly
characteristic
fashion
which
was
often
incorrect

admirable

marivaux

essayed

his
very
curious
full
of
types
drawn
from

drawn
with
an

was

as
exact
as
that

of

of
andré
almost
on
the
verge
of
the
revolution
quite
unexpectedly
there
emerged
a
really
great
poet
andré
chénier
marvellously
gifted
in
every
way
as
the
poet
of
love
he
recalled
catullus
and
tibullus
in
political
lyricism
he
suggested
though
with
more
fervour
as
elegiac
poet
he
possessed
a
grace
that
was
truly
grecian
as
the
poet
of
nature
he
employed
the
large
manner
of
lucretius
in
polemical
prose
he
was
remarkably
eloquent
struck
down
whilst
quite
young
amid
the
turmoil
of
the
revolution
he
bequeathed
immortal
fragments
no
doubt
he
would
have
been
the
greatest
french
poet
between
racine
and
lamartine
bernardin
de
in
prose
his
contemporary
bernardin
de
primarily
was
a
man
of
genius
since
he
wrote
that
immortal
idyllic
romance
and
subsequently
he
became
a
gracious
and
amiable
pupil
of
jean
jacques
rousseau
being
smitten
with
the
sentiment
of
nature
in
his
of
finally
he
attained
a
great
importance
in
literary
history
as
the
creator
of
exotic
literature
through
the
descriptions
he
wrote
of
many
lands
asia
african
isles
traversed
and
studied
by
him

pointed

succeeded

we
reach
the
nineteenth
century
the
nineteenth
at
the
commencement
of
a
century
which
was
so
brilliant
from
the
literary
aspect
james
delille
was
despotic
his
earlier
efforts
have
already
been
attended
to
a
skilled
versifier
but
without
fire
or
many
ideas
he
made
cultured
translations
from
virgil
and
milton
wrote
perennially
descriptive
poems
such
as
man
in
the
and
a
witty
satirical
poem
on
which
in
our
opinion
was
the
best
thing
he
wrote
great
poets
great

without

by
the

chateaubriand
the
first
generation
of
the
romantics
was
formed
by
lamartine
victor

and
alfred
de

romanticism
was
the
preponderance
of
imagination
and
sensibility
over
reason
and
observation
lamartine
rebathed
poetry
in
its
ancient
and
eternal
sources
love

the
sentiment

profoundly
moved

emerging
from

it

reverted
to
the
life
of
primaeval
man
as
he
conceived
it
to
be
when
humanity
was
still
barbarous
apart
from
his
poetic
works
he
wrote
history
of
the
which
is
a
romanesque

of
almost
the
whole
of
the
revolution

novels
some
autobiographic
episodes
and

victor
victor
hugo
though
less
sensitive
than
lamartine
but
more
imaginative
began
with
lyrical
poems
which
were
somewhat
reminiscent
of
the
classical
manner
then
went
on
to
pictures
of
the
east
thence
to
meditations
on
what
happened
to
himself
and
on
all
subjects
and
next
in
full
possession
of
his
genius
he
dwelt
on
great
philosophical
meditations

and
in
legend

that
epic
fragment

is
a

one
of
the
most
powerful
imaginations
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
as
well
as
a
of
who
made
a
style
for
himself
all
in
vision
and
colour
and
also
in
melody
and
orchestration
although
in
prose
he
lacked
one
part
of
his
resources
he
utilised
the
rest
magnificently
and
and
are
works
which
excite
admiration
at

in
parts
later
he
will
be
dealt
with

alfred
de
alfred
de
vigny
was
the
most
philosophical
of
these
three
great
poets
though
inferior
to
the
other
two
in
creative
imaginativeness
he
meditated
deeply
on
the
existence
of
evil
on
earth
on
the
misfortunes
of
man
and
the
sadness
of
life
and
his
most
despairing
songs
which
were
also
his
most
beautiful
left

echo

chief
representatives
they
bore
little
mutual
resemblance
be
it
said
the
former
only
knowing
how
to
sing
about
himself
his
pleasures
his
illusions
his
angers
and
above
all
his
sorrows
always
with
sincerity
and
in
accents
that
invariably
charmed
and
sometimes
lacerated
the
latter
supremely
artist
always
seeking
the
fair
exterior
and
delighting
in
reproducing
it
as
though
he
were
a

a

a
musician

and
dexterous

these
transpositions

they
were

the
prose

the
french
prose
writers
of
this
first
half
of

emphatically

also
already
been

chateaubriand
was
the
promoter
of
all
the
literary
movement
of
the
nineteenth
century
alike
in
prose
and
poetry
he
was
a
literary
theorist
an
epic
poet
in

traveller
polemist
orator
his
great
literary
theory
was
in
genius
of
and
consisted
in
supporting
that
all
true
poetic
beauties
lay
in
christianity
his
epic
poems
in
prose
are
a
picture
of
the
customs
of
american
indians
a
panorama
of
the
struggle
of
paganism
at
its
close
and
of
christianity
at
its
beginning
his
travels
were
voyage
in
and
itinerary
from
paris
to
member
of
the
parliamentary
assemblies
ambassador
and
minister
he
wrote
and
spoke
in
the
most
brilliant
and
impassioned
manner
on
the
subjects
that
he
took
up
finally
falling
back
on
himself
as
he
had
never
ceased
to
do
more
or
less
all
through
his
career
he
left
in
his
marvellous
from
beyond

a
posthumous
work
which
is
perhaps
his
masterpiece
his
infinitely
supple
and
variegated
style
formed
a
continuous
artistic
miracle
so
harmonious
and
musical
was
it
more
musical
even
than

which
she
thoroughly

reconsidered

she
imparted
an
appearance
of
originality
even
in
the
eyes

ardent
imagination
and
tremulous
sensitiveness
guizot

thiers
can
be
left
apart
for
they
were

although
capable

to
rationally

discipline
history
as
was

to
capture

accurately
and
to
set

put

as
for
the
novel
it
was
only
natural
that
it
should
be
deeply
affected
by
the
spirit
of
the
new
school
george
sand
wrote
lyrical
novels
if
the
phrase
may
be
used
and
as
i
think
it
is
here
the
accurate
expression
entitled
and
especially
she
was
to
impart
wisdom
later
on
it
even
happened
that
a
mind
born
to
see
reality
in
an
admirably
accurate
manner
saw
it
so
only
by
reason
of
the
times
or
at
least
partly
due
to
the
times
associated
it
with
a
magnifying
but
deforming
imagination
converting
it
into
a
literary
megalomania
and
this
was
the
case
of
honoré
de
balzac
nevertheless
as
was
only
natural
throughout
the
whole
of
the
romantic
epoch
there
was
an
entire
literature
which
did
not
submit
to
its
influence
and
simply
carried
on
the
tradition
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
poetry
there
was
the
witty
malicious
and
very
often
highly
exalted
béranger
whose
songs
are
almost
always
excellent
songs
and
sometimes
are
odes
and
there
was
also
the
able
and
dexterous
but
frigid
casimir
delavigne
in
prose
there
was
benjamin
constant
supremely
oratorical
and
a
very
luminous
orator
also
a
religious
philosopher

his
work

a
novelist

was

considerations

began
it

true

being

was

almost
from

became

history
of

sundry

the
principal
are

has
his
place
in

not
here

both
were
positivists
but

possessed
a
lively
and
profound
sense
of
the
grandeur
and
the
moral
beauty
of
christianity
taine

imbued
with
more
philosophic
strictness
renan
with
infinite
flexibility
of
intelligence

himself

always
with
some
excess
to
bring
home
to
us
the

christians

seductive

always
happens

of

astonishingly
plastic

rectilineal
order
step

step
and
with
a
measured
gait
to
a
solid
truth
which
he
did
not
wish
to
be
either
evasive
or
complex
highly
pessimistic
and

little

to
be
so
just

renan

optimistic

much
affected

so

evil
origin
of
man
and
of
the
necessity
for
him
to
be
drastically
curbed

he
is
to
remain
inoffensive
he
has
written
a
history
of
the
revolution
wherein
he
has
refused
admiration
and
respect
for
the
crimes
then
committed
which
is
why
posterity
now
begins
to
be
very
severe
upon

style

wholly
artificial

suitable
to
authors

depicted
them

they
studied
the

ability
as

there

which
possessed
great
moral
and
literary
beauties
herder
was
the
vico
of
germany
here
was
the
historical
philosopher
or
rather
the
thoughtful
philosopher
on
history
he
did
everything
literary
criticism
works
of
erudition
translations
even
personal
poems
but
his
great
work
was
on
the
philosophy
of
the
history
of
this
was
the
theory
of
progress
in
all
its
breadth
and
majesty
supported
by
arguments
that
are
at
least
spacious
and
imposing
from
michelet
to
quinet
on
to
renan
every
french
author
who
has
at
all
regarded
the
unity
of
the
destinies
of
the
human
race
has
drawn
inspiration
from
him
his
broad
measured
and
highly
coloured
style
is
on
the
level
of
the
subject
and
conforms
to
it
even
in
an
exclusively
literary
history
kant
must
not
be
forgotten
because
when
he
set
himself
to
compose
a
moral
dissertation
as
for
example
the
one
upon
lying
he
took
high
rank
as
a
writer
the
glorious
thus
is
reached
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
close
on
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
this
intermediary
epoch
shone
the
most
glorious
hour
of
teutonic
literature
simultaneously
iffland
kotzebue
körner
schiller
and
goethe
were
to
the
fore
this
formed
a
great
constellation
iffland

friend

of

wrote
numerous
dramas
the
principal
of
which
were
criminal
through

he
was
realistic
without
being
gloomy
he
resembled
the
french
sédaine
kotzebue
who
was
the
friend
of
catherine
of
russia
subsequently
disgraced
by
her
possessed
a
highly
irritable
and
quarrelsome
disposition
and
was
finally
killed
in
as
a
reactionary
by
a
liberal
student
did
not
fall
far
short
of
genius
he
wrote
a
number
of
dramas
and
comedies
those
still
read
with
pleasure

and
small
german
which
has
remained
a

körner
the
tyrtaeus
of
germany
was
simultaneously
a
brave
soldier
and
a
great
lyrical
poet
who
was
killed
on
the
battlefield
of
gadebusch
wrote
lyrical
poems
dramas
comedies
farces
and
above
all
lyre
and
imbued
with
splendid
spirit
schiller
is
a
vast
genius
historian
lyrical
poet
dramatic
poet
critic
and
in
all
these
different
fields
he
showed
himself
to
be
profoundly
original
he
wrote
thirty
years
odes
ballads
dithyrambic
poems
such
as
so
universally
celebrated
dissertations
of
philosophic
criticism
such
as
god
of
and
finally
a
whole
repertory
of
drama
the
only
point
on
which
it
is
possible
to
show
that
he
surpasses
goethe
in
which
may
be
remarked
his
first
audacious
and
anarchical
work
then
the
of
and
a
trilogy
composed
of
camp
of
death
of
betrothed
of
maid
of
by
his
example
primarily
and
by
his
instruction
subsequently
letters
on
don
on
aesthetic
etc
he
exercised
over
literature
and
over
german
thought
an
influence
at
least
equal
and
i
believe
superior
to
that
of
goethe
he
was
united
to
goethe
by
the
ties
of
a
profound
and
undeviating
friendship
he
died
whilst
still
young
in
years
before
his
illustrious
friend
goethe
whom
posterity
can
only
put
in
the
same
rank
as
homer
is
even
more
universal
genius
and
has
approached
yet
closer
to
absolute
beauty
of
education
he
subsequently
studied
at
strasburg
commencing
whilst
still
almost
a
student
with
the
imperishable
to
which
it
may
be
said
that
a
whole
literature
is
devoted
and
parenthetically
a
literature
diametrically
opposed
to
what
goethe
subsequently
became
then
a
journey
through
italy
which
revealed
goethe
to
himself
made
him
a
man
who
never
ceased
to
desire
to
combine
classic
beauty
and
teutonic
ways
of
thinking
and
who
was
often
magnificently
successful
to
put
it
in
another
way
goethe
in
his
own
land
is
a
renaissance
in
himself
and
the
renaissance
which
germany
had
not
known
in
either
the
sixteenth
or
seventeenth
century
came
as
the
gift
of
goethe
immediately
after
his
return
from
italy
he
wrote
of
classic
inspiration
of
teutonic
inspiration
classical
teutonic
etc
then
came
and
which
was
absolutely
classic
in
the
simplicity
of
its
plan
and
purity
of
lyric
verse
but
essentially
modern
in
its
picture
of
german
customs
roman
elective
and
autobiography
mingled
with
romance
western
eastern
lyrical
poems
and
finally
the
two
parts
of
in
the
first
part
of
goethe
was
and
desired
to
be
entirely
german
in
the
second
through
many
reveries
more
or
less
relative
to
the
theme
he
more
particularly
desires
to
depict
the
union
of
the
german
spirit
with
that
of
classical
genius
which
formed
his
own
life
and
led
to
which
also
was
a
portion
of
his
existence
and
for
beauty
drama
pathos
ease
phantasy
and
fertility
in

nothing
has
ever
surpassed

anything
has
even
equalled
the
two
parts
of
regarded
as
a

apart
from

himself

in

research

they
were

still
in

subsisted

only
natural
he
made

it

be

from
his
correspondence
that
he

he
was
verbose

often
really
eloquent

batiouchkov
although
he
lived
right
into
the
middle
of

nineteenth
century
is
already
a

he
venerated
and
imitated
the
writers
of
antiquity
he
was
a
devout
admirer
of
tibullus
and
wrote
elegies
which
are
quite
exquisite
krylov
was
a
fabulist
a
dexterous
delineator
of
animals
and
a
delicate
humourist
frenchmen
and
italians
have
been
alike
fascinated
by
him
and
his
works
have
often
been
translated
until
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
enjoyed
european
popularity
the
golden
age
the
true
russian
nineteenth
century
and
its
golden
age
must
be
dated
from
pushkin
he
wrote
from
his
earliest
youth
he
was
an
epic
poet
novelist
and
historian
his
principal
poems
were
and
his
most
remarkable
historical
essay
was
revolt
of
he
possessed
a
fertile
and
vigorous
imagination
which
he
developed
by
continual
and
enthusiastic
study
of
byron
he
did
not
live
long
enough
either
for
his
own
fame
or
for
the
welfare
of
russian
literature
being
killed
in
a
duel
at
the
age
of
mérimée
translated
much
by
pushkin
the
french
lyric
stage
has
mounted
one
of
his
most
delicate
inspirations
the
water
nymph
he
was
quite
conscious
of
his
own
genius
and
freely
imitating
the
of
horace
as
will
be
seen
he
wrote
i
have
raised
to
myself
a
monument
which
no
human
hand
has
constructed
i
shall
not
entirely
perish
the
sound
of
my
name
shall
permeate
through
vast
russia
for
long
i
shall
be
dear
to
my
race
because
my
lyre
has
uttered
good
sentiments
because
in
a
brutal
age
i
have
vaunted
liberty
and
preached
love
for
the
oh

heed
the
commands
of

fear
not

no

never

lermontov
was
not
inferior
to
his
friend
pushkin
whom
he
closely
resembled
like
him
he
drew
inspiration
from
the
romantic
poets
of
the
west
he
loved
the
east
and
his
short
glorious
suggestions
came
to
him
from
the
caucasus
among
his
finest
poetic
works
may
be
cited
novice
ismael
song
of
the
tzar
he
wrote
a
novel
perhaps
autobiographical
entitled
hero
of
our
own
the
hero
of
which
is
painted
in
highly
byronic
colours
russian
taste
was
already
veering
to
the
epic
novel
or
epopee
in
prose
of
which
gogol
was
the
most
illustrious
representative
until
tolstoy
he
was
highly
gifted
in
him
the
feeling
for
nature
was
acutely
active
and
recalling
his
descriptions
of
the
plains
of
the
crimea
its
rivers
and
steppes
he
must
be
regarded
as
the
rousseau
and
chateaubriand
of
russia
further
he
was
a
close
student
of
village
habits
and
a
painter
in
astonishing
hues
he
eminently
possessed
the
sense
of
epic
grandeur
and
added
a
sarcastic
vein
of
delightful
irony
his
of
the
of
a
and
have
the
force
of
arresting
realism
his
inspector
of
finances
is
a
caustic
comedy
which
has
been
a
classic
not
only
in
russia
but
in
france
where
it
was
introduced
in
translation
by
mérimée
turgenev
less
epical
than
gogol
was
also
studious
of
local
habits
and
dexterous
in
describing
them
he
began
with
exquisite
impregnated
with
truth
and
precision
as
well
as
intimate
and
picturesque
details
then
he
extended
his
scope
and
wrote
novels
but
never
at
great
length
and
therefore
suited
to
the
exigencies
or
habits
of
western
europe
such
as
he
had
selected
paris
as
his
abode
and
he
mixed
with
the
greatest
thinkers
of
the
day
taine
flaubert
edmond
about
in
the
eyes
of
his
he
became
ultimately
too
western
and
too
parisian
his
was
a
delicate
sensitive
soul
prone
to
melancholy
and
perpetually
dreaming
he
had
a
cult
of
form
in
which
he
went
so
far
as
to
make
it
a
sort
of
scruple
and
superstition
tolstoy
so
recently
dead
was
a
great
epic
poet
in
prose
a
very
powerful
and
affecting
novelist
and
in
some
measure
an
apostle
he
began
with
adolescence
and
in
itself
very
curious
and
particularly
valuable
because
of
the
idea
it
conveys
of
the
life
of
the
lords
of
the
russian
soil
and
for
its
explanation
of
the
formation
of
the
soul
and
genius
of
tolstoy
then
came
full
of
magnificent
descriptions
of
the
caucasus
and
of
interesting
scenes
of
military
and
rural
life
subsequently
that
masterpiece
of
tolstoy
and
narratives
dealing
with
the
war
of
napoleon
with
russia
and
of
the
subsequent
period
of
peaceful
and
healthy
rural
life
it
is
impossible
to
adequately
admire
the
power
of
narration
and
descriptive
force
the
fertility
of
incidents
characterisations
and
dramatic
moments
the
art
or
rather
the
gift
of
portraiture
and
finally
the
grandeur
and
moral
elevation
in
fact
all
the
qualities
not
one
of
which
he
appeared
to
lack
of
which
tolstoy
gave
proof
and
which
he
displayed
in
this
immense
history
of
the
russian
soul
at
the
commencement
of
the
nineteenth
century
for
it
is
thus
that
it
is
meet
to
qualify
this
noble
creation
the
only
analogy
is
with
of
victor
hugo
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
despite
its
incomparable
merits
the
french
work
is
the
more
unequal
is
only
a
novel
in
the
vein
of
french
novels
but
very
profound
and
remarkable
for
its
analysis
of
character
and
also
impassioned
and
affecting
besides
having
considerable
moral
range
kreutzer
is
a
romance
rather
than
a
novel
but
cruelly
beautiful
because
it
exposes
with
singular
clairvoyance
the
misery
of
a
soul
impotent
for
happiness
shows
that
mournful
and
impassioned
pity
felt
by
tolstoy
for
the
humble
and
the
fallen
to
use
the
phrase
of
pushkin
it
realises
a
lofty
dramatic
beauty
tolstoy
in
a
thousand
pamphlets
or
brief
works
preached
to
his
own
people
and
to
mankind
the
strict
morality
of
christ
charity
renunciation
peace
at
all
price
without
taking
into
account
the
necessities
of
social
life
and
he
denounced
as
had
jean
jacques
rousseau
the
culpability
of
art
and
literature
being
resigned
to
recognising
his
own
works
as
condemnable
his
was
the
soul
of
an
exalted
poet
and
a
lofty
poetical
mind
from
a
poet
must
not
be
demanded
practical
common
sense
or
that
feeling
for
reality
which
is
demanded
often
unavailingly
from
a
statesman
dostoevsky
with
a
tragic
genius
as
great
as
that
of
tolstoy
may
be
said
to
have
been
more
restricted
because
he
exclusively
delineated
the
unhappy
the
miserable
and
those
defeated
in
life
he
knew
them
personally
because
after
being
arrested
in
at
the
age
of
fifty
for
the
crime
of
belonging
to
a
secret
society
he
spent
years
in
the
convict
prisons
of
siberia
those
miseries
he
describes
in
the
most
exact
terms
and
with
eloquence
in
alive
ten
years
in
and
in
the
remarkable
novel
entitled
and
he
has
lent
invaluable
aid
in
the
propagation
of
two
sentiments
which
have
created
some
stir
in
the
west
and
which
assuredly
we
desire
to
foster
namely
the
religion
of
human
suffering
and
the
cult
of
expiation
