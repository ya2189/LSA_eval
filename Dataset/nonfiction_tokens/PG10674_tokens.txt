preface
to
the
second
edition
the
kindly
reception
accorded
to
the
first
edition
of
this
book
has
confirmed
the
author
in
his
conviction
that
such
a
book
was
needed
and
has
tempted
him
to
bestow
additional
labor
upon
it
the
chief
changes
consist
in
the
addition
of
two
new
chapters
active
imagination
and
how
to
develop
interest
in
a
subject
the
division
into
two
parts
of
the
unwieldy
chapter
on
memory
the
addition
of
readings
and
exercises
at
the
end
of
each
chapter
the
preparation
of
an
analytical
table
of
contents
the
correction
of
the
bibliography
to
date
the
addition
of
an
index
and
some
recasting
of
phraseology
in
the
interest
of
clearness
and
emphasis
the
author
gratefully
acknowledges
the
constructive
suggestions
of
reviewers
and
others
who
have
used
the
book
and
hopes
that
he
has
profited
by
them
in
this
revision
april
preface
to
the
first
edition
educational
leaders
are
seeing
with
increasing
clearness
the
necessity
of
teaching
students
not
only
the
of
study
but
also
methods
of
study
teachers
are
beginning
to
see
that
students
waste
a
vast
amount
of
time
and
form
many
harmful
habits
because
they
do
not
know
how
to
use
their
minds
the
recognition
of
this
condition
is
taking
the
form
of
the
movement
toward
supervised
study
which
attempts
to
acquaint
the
student
with
principles
of
economy
and
directness
in
using
his
mind
it
is
generally
agreed
that
there
are
certain
tricks
which
make
for
mental
efficiency
consisting
of
methods
of
apperceiving
facts
methods
of
review
devices
for
arranging
work
some
are
the
fruits
of
psychological
experimentation
others
are
derived
from
experience
many
of
them
can
be
imparted
by
instruction
and
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
systematizing
these
and
making
them
available
for
students
that
this
book
is
prepared
the
evils
of
unintelligent
and
unsupervised
study
are
evident
to
all
who
have
any
connection
with
modern
education
they
pervade
the
entire
educational
structure
from
kindergarten
through
college
in
college
they
are
especially
apparent
in
the
case
of
freshmen
who
in
addition
to
the
numerous
difficulties
incident
to
entrance
into
the
college
world
suffer
peculiarly
because
they
do
not
know
how
to
attack
the
difficult
subjects
of
the
curriculum
in
recognition
of
these
conditions
special
attention
is
given
at
the
university
of
chicago
toward
supervision
of
study
all
freshmen
in
the
school
of
commerce
and
administration
of
the
university
are
given
a
course
in
methods
of
study
in
which
practical
discussions
and
demonstrations
are
given
regarding
the
ways
of
studying
the
freshman
subjects
in
addition
to
the
cases
presenting
special
features
are
given
individual
attention
for
it
must
be
admitted
that
while
certain
difficulties
are
common
to
all
students
there
are
individual
cases
that
present
peculiar
phases
and
these
can
be
served
only
by
personal
consultations
these
personal
consultations
are
expensive
both
in
time
and
patience
for
it
frequently
happens
that
the
mental
habits
of
a
student
must
be
thoroughly
reconstructed
and
this
requires
much
time
and
attention
but
the
results
well
repay
the
effort
a
valuable
accessory
to
such
individual
supervision
over
students
has
been
found
in
the
use
of
psychological
tests
which
have
been
described
by
the
author
in
a
monograph
entitled
the
scientific
study
of
the
college
student
footnote
princeton
university
press
but
the
college
is
not
the
most
strategic
point
at
which
to
administer
guidance
in
methods
of
study
such
training
is
even
more
acceptably
given
in
the
high
school
and
grades
here
habits
of
mental
application
are
largely
set
and
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
they
be
set
right
for
the
sake
of
the
welfare
of
the
individuals
and
of
the
institutions
of
higher
education
that
receive
them
later
another
reason
for
incorporating
training
in
methods
of
study
into
secondary
and
elementary
schools
is
that
more
individuals
will
be
helped
inasmuch
as
the
eliminative
process
has
not
yet
reached
its
culmination
in
high
schools
where
systematic
supervision
of
study
is
a
feature
classes
are
usually
conducted
in
methods
of
study
and
it
is
hoped
that
this
book
will
meet
the
demand
for
a
for
such
classes
the
material
being
well
within
the
reach
of
high
school
students
in
high
schools
where
instruction
in
methods
of
study
is
given
as
part
of
a
course
in
elementary
psychology
the
book
should
also
prove
useful
inasmuch
as
it
gives
a
summary
of
psychological
principles
relating
to
the
cognitive
processes
in
the
grades
the
book
can
not
be
put
into
the
hands
of
the
pupils
but
it
should
be
mastered
by
the
teacher
and
applied
in
her
supervising
and
teaching
activities
embodying
as
it
does
the
results
of
researches
in
educational
psychology
it
should
prove
especially
suitable
for
use
in
teachers
reading
circles
where
a
concise
presentation
of
the
facts
regarding
the
psychology
of
the
learning
process
is
desired
there
is
another
group
of
students
who
need
training
in
methods
of
study
brain
workers
in
business
and
industry
feel
deeply
the
need
of
greater
mental
efficiency
and
seek
eagerly
for
means
to
attain
it
their
earnestness
in
this
search
is
evidenced
by
the
success
of
various
systems
for
the
training
of
memory
will
and
other
mental
traits
further
evidence
is
found
in
the
efforts
of
many
corporations
to
maintain
schools
and
classes
for
the
intellectual
improvement
of
their
employees
to
all
such
the
author
offers
the
work
with
the
hope
that
it
may
be
useful
in
directing
them
toward
greater
mental
efficiency
in
courses
in
methods
of
study
in
which
the
book
is
used
as
a
the
instructor
should
lay
emphasis
not
upon
memorization
of
the
facts
in
the
book
but
upon
the
application
of
them
in
study
he
should
expect
to
see
parallel
with
progress
through
the
book
improvement
in
the
mental
ability
of
the
students
specific
problems
may
well
be
arranged
on
the
basis
of
the
subjects
of
the
curriculum
and
students
should
be
urged
to
utilize
the
suggestions
immediately
the
subjects
treated
in
the
book
are
those
which
the
author
has
found
in
his
experience
with
college
students
to
constitute
the
most
frequent
sources
of
difficulty
and
under
these
conditions
the
sequence
of
topics
followed
in
the
book
has
seemed
most
favorable
for
presentation
with
other
groups
of
students
however
another
sequence
of
topics
may
be
found
desirable
if
so
the
order
of
topics
may
be
changed
for
example
in
case
the
chapter
on
brain
action
is
found
to
presuppose
more
physiological
knowledge
than
that
possessed
by
the
students
it
may
be
omitted
or
may
be
used
merely
for
reference
when
enlightenment
is
desired
upon
some
of
the
physiological
descriptions
in
later
chapters
likewise
the
chapter
dealing
with
intellectual
difficulties
of
college
students
may
be
omitted
with
groups
the
heavy
obligation
of
the
author
to
a
number
of
writers
will
be
apparent
to
one
familiar
with
the
literature
of
theoretical
and
educational
psychology
no
attempt
is
made
to
render
specific
acknowledgments
but
special
mention
should
be
made
of
the
large
draughts
made
upon
the
two
books
by
professor
stiles
which
treat
so
helpfully
of
the
bodily
relations
of
the
student
these
books
contain
so
much
good
sense
and
scientific
information
that
they
should
receive
a
prominent
place
among
the
books
recommended
to
students
thanks
are
due
to
professor
edgar
james
swift
and
charles
scribner
sons
for
permission
to
use
a
figure
from

in
the

and
to
lippincott

for

the
author
gratefully
acknowledges
helpful
suggestions
from
professors
james
angell
charles
judd
and
judson
herrick
who
have
read
the
greater
part
of
the
manuscript
and
have
commented
upon
it
to
its
betterment
the
obligation
refers
however
not
only
to
the
immediate
preparation
of
this
work
but
also
to
the
encouragement
which
for
several
years
the
author
has
received

intellectual
problems
of
the
college
freshman
in
entering
upon
a
college
course
you
are
taking
a
step
that
may
completely
revolutionize
your
life
you
are
facing
new
situations
vastly
different
from
any
you
have
previously
met
they
are
also
of
great
variety
such
as
finding
a
place
to
eat
and
sleep
regulating
your
own
finances
inaugurating
a
new
social
life
forming
new
friendships
and
developing
in
body
and
mind
the
problems
connected
with
mental
development
will
engage
your
chief
attention
you
are
now
going
to
use
your
mind
more
actively
than
ever
before
and
should
survey
some
of
the
intellectual
difficulties
before
plunging
into
the
fight
perhaps
the
first
difficulty
you
will
encounter
is
the
substitution
of
the
lecture
for
the
class
recitation
to
which
you
were
accustomed
in
high
school
this
substitution
requires
that
you
develop
a
new
technic
of
learning
for
the
mental
processes
involved
in
an
oral
recitation
are
different
from
those
used
in
listening
to
a
lecture
the
lecture
system
implies
that
the
lecturer
has
a
fund
of
knowledge
about
a
certain
field
and
has
organized
this
knowledge
in
a
form
that
is
not
duplicated
in
the
literature
of
the
subject
the
manner
of
presentation
then
is
unique
and
is
the
only
means
of
securing
the
knowledge
in
just
that
form
as
soon
as
the
words
have
left
the
mouth
of
the
lecturer
they
cease
to
be
accessible
to
you
such
conditions
require
a
unique
mental
attitude
and
unique
mental
habits
you
will
be
obliged
in
the
first
place
to
maintain
sustained
attention
over
long
periods
of
time
the
situation
is
not
like
that
in
reading
in
which
a
temporary
lapse
of
attention
may
be
remedied
by
turning
back
and
rereading
in
listening
to
a
lecture
you
are
obliged
to
catch
the
words
on
the
fly
accordingly
you
must
develop
new
habits
of
paying
attention
you
will
also
need
to
develop
a
new
technic
for
memorizing
especially
for
memorizing
things
heard
as
a
partial
aid
in
this
and
also
for
purposes
of
organizing
material
received
in
lectures
you
will
need
to
develop
ability
to
take
notes
this
is
a
process
with
which
you
have
heretofore
had
little
to
do
it
is
a
most
important
phase
of
college
life
however
and
will
repay
earnest
study
another
characteristic
of
college
study
is
the
vast
amount
of
reading
required
instead
of
using
a
single
for
each
course
you
may
use
several
they
may
cover
great
historical
periods
and
represent
the
ideas
of
many
men
in
view
of
the
amount
of
reading
assigned
you
will
also
be
obliged
to
learn
to
read
faster
no
longer
will
you
have
time
to
dawdle
sleepily
through
the
pages
of
easy
texts
you
will
have
to
cover
perhaps
fifty
or
a
hundred
pages
of
knotty
reading
every
day
accordingly
you
must
learn
to
handle
books
expeditiously
and
to
comprehend
quickly
in
fact
economy
must
be
your
watchword
throughout
a
german
lesson
in
high
school
may
cover
thirty
or
forty
lines
a
day
requiring
an
hour
preparation
a
german
assignment
in
college
however
may
cover
four
or
five
or
a
dozen
pages
requiring
hard
work
for
two
or
three
hours
you
should
be
warned
also
that
college
demands
not
only
a
greater
quantity
but
also
a
higher
quality
of
work
when
you
were
a
high
school
student
the
world
expected
only
a
high
school
student
accomplishments
of
you
now
you
are
a
college
student
however
and
your
intellectual
responsibilities
have
increased
the
world
regards
you
now
as
a
person
of
considerable
scholastic
attainment
and
expects
more
of
you
than
before
in
academic
terms
this
means
that
in
order
to
attain
a
grade
of
in
college
you
will
have
to
work
much
harder
than
you
did
for
that
grade
in
high
school
for
here
you
have
not
only
more
difficult
but
also
keener
competition
for
the
first
place
in
high
school
you
may
have
been
the
brightest
student
in
your
class
in
college
however
you
encounter
the
brightest
students
from
many
schools
if
your
merits
are
going
to
stand
out
prominently
therefore
you
must
work
much
harder
your
work
from
now
on
must
be
of
better
quality
not
the
least
of
the
perplexities
of
your
life
as
a
college
student
will
arise
from
the
fact
that
no
daily
schedule
is
arranged
for
you
the
only
time
definitely
assigned
for
your
work
is
the
fifteen
hours
a
week
more
or
less
spent
in
the
the
rest
of
your
schedule
must
be
arranged
by
yourself
this
is
a
real
task
and
will
require
care
and
thought
if
your
work
is
to
be
done
with
greatest
economy
of
time
and
effort
this
brief
survey
completes
the
catalogue
of
problems
of
mental
development
that
will
vex
you
most
in
adjusting
your
methods
of
study
to
college
conditions
in
order
to
make
this
adjustment
you
will
be
obliged
to
form
a
number
of
new
habits
indeed
as
you
become
more
and
more
expert
as
a
student
you
will
see
that
the
whole
process
resolves
itself
into
one
of
for
while
a
college
education
has
two
phases
the
acquisition
of
facts
and
the
formation
of
habits
it
is
the
latter
which
is
the
more
important
many
of
the
facts
that
you
learn
will
be
forgotten
many
will
be
outlawed
by
time
but
the
habits
of
study
you
form
will
be
permanent
possessions
they
will
consist
of
such
things
as
methods
of
grasping
facts
methods
of
reasoning
about
facts
and
of
concentrating
attention
in
acquiring
these
habits
you
must
have
some
material
upon
which
you
may
concentrate
your
attention
and
it
will
be
supplied
by
the
subjects
of
the
curriculum
you
will
be
asked
for
instance
to
write
innumerable
themes
in
courses
in
english
composition
not
for
the
purpose
of
enriching
the
world
literature
nor
for
the
delectation
of
your
english
instructor
but
for
the
sake
of
helping
you
to
form
habits
of
forceful
expression
you
will
be
asked
to
enter
the
laboratory
and
perform
numerous
experiments
not
to
discover
hitherto
unknown
facts
but
to
obtain
practice
in
scientific
procedure
and
to
learn
how
to
seek
knowledge
by
yourself
the
curriculum
and
the
faculty
are
the
means
but
you
yourself
are
the
agent
in
the
educational
process
no
matter
how
good
the
curriculum
or
how
renowned
the
faculty
you
can
not
be
educated
without
the
most
vigorous
efforts
on
your
part
banish
the
thought
that
you
are
here
to
have
knowledge
pumped
into
you
to
acquire
an
education
you
must
establish
and
maintain
not
a
passive
attitude
but
an
active
attitude
when
you
go
to
the
gymnasium
to
build
up
a
good
physique
the
physical
director
does
not
tell
you
to
hold
yourself
limp
and
passive
while
he
pumps
your
arms
and
legs
up
and
down
rather
he
urges
you
to
put
forth
effort
to
exert
yourself
until
you
are
tired
only
by
so
doing
can
you
develop
physical
power
this
principle
holds
true
of
mental
development
learning
is
not
a
process
of
passive
it
is
a
matter
of
vigorous
effort
and
the
harder
you
work
the
more
powerful
you
become
in
securing
a
college
education
you
are
your
own
master
in
the
development
of
physical
prowess
you
are
well
aware
of
the
importance
of
doing
everything
in
good
form
in
such
sports
as
swimming
and
hurdling
speed
and
grace
depend
primarily
upon
it
the
same
principle
holds
true
in
the
development
of
the
mind
the
most
serviceable
mind
is
that
which
accomplishes
results
in
the
shortest
time
and
with
least
waste
motion
take
every
precaution
therefore
to
rid
yourself
of
all
superfluous
and
impeding
methods
strive
for
the
development
of
good
form
in
study

this

time
when

are

chapter
ii
most
educated
people
find
occasion
at
some
time
or
other
to
take
notes
although
this
is
especially
true
of
college
students
they
have
little
success
as
any
college
instructor
will
testify
students
as
a
rule
do
not
realize
that
there
is
any
skill
involved
in
taking
notes
not
until
examination
time
arrives
and
they
try
vainly
to
labor
through
a
maze
of
scribbling
do
they
realize
that
there
must
be
some
system
in
a
careful
examination
of
shows
that
there
are
rules
or
principles
which
when
followed
have
much
to
do
with
increasing
ability
in
study
one
criterion
that
should
guide
in
the
preparation
of
notes
is
the
use
to
which
they
will
be
put
if
this
is
kept
in
mind
many
blunders
will
be
saved
notes
may
be
used
in
three
ways
as
material
for
directing
each
day
study
for
cramming
and
for
permanent
professional
use
thus
a
may
be
a
thing
of
value
notes
you
take
now
as
a
student
may
be
valuable
years
hence
in
professional
life
recognition
of
this
will
help
you
in
the
preparation
of
your
notes
and
will
determine
many
times
how
they
should
be
prepared
the
chief
situations
in
college
which
require
are
lectures
library
reading
and
laboratory
work
accordingly
the
subject
will
be
considered
under
these
three
heads
lecture
when
taking
notes
on
a
lecture
there
are
two
extremes
that
present
themselves
to
take
exceedingly
full
notes
or
to
take
almost
no
notes
one
can
err
in
either
direction
true
on
first
thought
entire
stenographic
reports
of
lectures
appear
desirable
but
second
thought
will
show
that
they
may
be
dispensed
with
not
only
without
loss
but
with
much
gain
the
most
obvious
objection
is
that
too
much
time
would
be
consumed
in
transcribing
notes
another
is
that
much
of
the
material
in
a
lecture
is
undesirable
for
permanent
possession
the
instructor
repeats
much
for
the
sake
of
emphasis
he
multiplies
illustrations
not
important
in
themselves
but
important
for
the
sake
of
stressing
his
point
you
do
not
need
these
illustrations
in
written
form
however
for
once
the
point
is
made
you
rarely
need
to
depend
upon
the
illustrations
for
its
retention
a
still
more
cogent
objection
is
that
if
you
occupy
your
attention
with
the
task
of
copying
the
lecture
verbatim
you
do
not
have
time
to
think
but
become
merely
an
automatic
recording
machine
experienced
stenographers
say
that
they
form
the
habit
of
recording
so
automatically
that
they
fail
utterly
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
what
is
said
you
as
a
student
can
not
afford
to
have
your
attention
so
distracted
from
the
meaning
of
the
lecture
therefore
reduce
your
classroom
writing
to
a
minimum
probably
the
chief
reason
why
students
are
so
eager
to
secure
full
lecture
notes
is
that
they
fear
to
trust
their
memory
such
fears
should
be
put
at
rest
for
your
mind
will
retain
facts
if
you
pay
close
attention
and
make
logical
associations
during
the
time
of
impression
keep
your
mind
free
then
to
work
upon
the
of
the
lecture
debate
mentally
with
the
speaker
question
his
statements
comparing
them
with
your
own
experience
or
with
the
results
of
your
study
ask
yourself
frequently
is
that
true
the
essential
thing
is
to
maintain
an
attitude
of
mental
activity
and
to
avoid
anything
that
will
reduce
this
and
make
you
passive
do
not
think
of
yourself
as
a
vat
into
which
the
instructor
pumps
knowledge
regard
yourself
rather
as
an
active
force
quick
to
perceive
and
to
comprehend
meaning
deliberate
in
acceptance
and
firm
in
retention
after
observing
the
stress
laid
throughout
this
book
upon
the
necessity
for
logical
associations
you
will
readily
see
that
the
to
is
let
your
notes
represent
the
logical
progression
of
thought
in
the
lecture
strive
above
all
else
to
secure
the
skeleton
the
framework
upon
which
the
lecture
is
hung
a
lecture
is
a
logical
structure
and
the
form
in
which
it
is
presented
is
the
outline
this
outline
then
is
your
chief
concern
in
the
case
of
some
lectures
it
is
an
easy
matter
the
lecturer
may
place
the
outline
in
your
hands
beforehand
may
present
it
on
the
or
may
give
it
orally
some
lecturers
too
present
their
material
in
such
divisions
that
the
outline
is
easily
followed
others
however
are
very
difficult
to
follow
in
this
regard
in
arranging
an
outline
you
will
find
it
wise
to
adopt
some
device
by
which
the
parts
will
stand
out
prominently
and
the
progression
of
thought
will
be
indicated
with
proper
subordination
of
titles
adopt
some
system
at
the
beginning
of
your
college
course
and
use
it
in
all
your
notes
the
system
here
given
may
serve
as
a
model
using
first
the
roman
numerals
then
capitals
then
arabic
numerals
ii

in
concluding
this
discussion
of
lecture
notes
you
should
be
urged
to
make
good
use
of
your
notes
after
they
are
taken
first
glance
over
them
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
lecture
inasmuch
as
they
will
then
be
fresh
in
your
mind
you
will
be
able
to
recall
almost
the
entire
lecture
you
will
also
be
able
to
supply
missing
parts
from
memory
some
students
make
it
a
rule
to
reduce
all
to
typewritten
form
soon
after
the
lecture
this
is
an
excellent
practice
but
is
rather
expensive
in
time
in
addition
to
this
review
you
should
make
a
second
review
of
your
notes
as
the
first
step
in
the
preparation
of
the
next
day
lesson
this
will
connect
up
the
lessons
with
each
other
and
will
make
the
course
a
unified
whole
instead
of
a
series
of
disconnected
parts
too
often
a
course
exists
in
a
mind
as
a
series
of
separate
discussions
and
he
sees
only
the
horizon
of
a
single
day
this
condition
might
be
represented
by
a
series
of
disconnected
links
o
o
o
o
o
a
summary
of
each
day
lesson
however
preceding
the
preparation
for
the
next
day
forges
new
links
and
welds
them
all
together
into
an
unbroken
chain
oooooooooo
a
method
that
has
been
found
helpful
is
to
use
a
system
of
notetaking
using
the
page
for
the
bare
outline
with
largest
divisions
and
the
page
for
the
details
this
device
makes
the
readily
available
for
hasty
review
or
for
more
extended
study
reading
the
question
of
full
or
scanty
notes
arises
in
reading
notes
as
in
lecture
notes
in
general
your
notes
should
represent
a
summary
in
your
own
words
of
the
author
discussion
not
a
duplication
of
it
students
sometimes
acquire
the
habit
of
reading
single
sentences
at
a
time
then
of
writing
them
down
thinking
that
by
making
an
exact
copy
of
the
book
they
are
playing
safe
this
is
a
pernicious
practice
it
spoils
continuity
of
thought
and
application
furthermore
isolated
sentences
mean
little
and
fail
grossly
to
represent
the
real
thought
of
the
author
a
better
way
is
to
read
through
an
entire
paragraph
or
section
then
close
the
book
and
reproduce
in
your
own
words
what
you
have
read
next
take
your
summary
and
compare
with
the
original
text
to
see
that
you
have
really
grasped
the
point
this
procedure
will
be
beneficial
in
several
ways
it
will
encourage
continuous
concentration
of
attention
to
an
entire
argument
it
will
help
you
to
preserve
relative
emphasis
of
parts
it
will
lead
you
to
regard
thought
and
not
words
you
are
undoubtedly
familiar
with
the
state
of
mind
wherein
you
find
yourself
reading
merely
words
and
not
following
the
thought
lastly
material
studied
in
this
way
is
remembered
longer
than
material
read
scrappily
in
short
such
a
method
of
reading
makes
not
only
for
good
memory
but
for
good
mental
habits
of
all
kinds
in
all
your
reading
hold
to
the
conception
of
yourself
as
a
thinker
not
a
sponge
remember
you
do
not
need
to
accept
unqualifiedly
everything
you
read
a
worthy
ideal
for
every
student
to
follow
is
expressed
in
the
motto
carved
on
the
wall
of
the
great
of
the
harper
memorial
library
at
the
university
of
chicago
read
not
to
contradict
nor
to
believe
but
to
weigh
and
consider
ibsen
bluntly
states
the
same
thought
do
read
to
swallow
read
to
choose
for
is
but
to
see
what
one
has
use
for
ask
yourself
when
beginning
a
printed
discussion
what
am
i
looking
for
what
is
the
author
going
to
talk
about
often
this
will
be
indicated
in
topical
headings
keep
it
in
the
background
of
your
mind
while
reading
and
search
for
the
answer
then
when
you
have
read
the
necessary
portion
close
the
book
and
summarize
to
see
if
the
author
furnished
what
you
sought
in
short
always
read
for
a
purpose
formulate
problems
and
seek
their
solutions
in
this
way
will
there
be
direction
in
your
reading
and
your
thought
this
discussion
of
reading
notes
has
turned
into
an
essay
on
how
to
read
and
you
must
be
convinced
by
this
time
that
there
is
much
to
learn
in
this
respect
so
much
that
we
may
profitably
spend
more
time
in
discussing
it
every
book
you
take
up
should
be
opened
with
some
preliminary
ceremony
this
does
not
refer
to
the
physical
operation
of
opening
a
new
book
but
to
the
mental
operation
in
general
take
the
following
steps
observe
the
title
see
exactly
what
field
the
book
attempts
to
cover
observe
the
author
name
if
you
are
to
use
his
book
frequently
discover
his
position
in
the
field
remember
you
are
going
to
accept
him
as
authority
and
you
should
know
his
status
you
may
be
told
this
on
the
or
you
may
have
to
consult
who
who
or
the
biographical
dictionary
glance
over
the
preface
under
some
circumstances
you
should
read
it
carefully
if
you
are
going
to
refer
to
the
book
very
often
make
friends
with
the
author
let
him
introduce
himself
to
you
this
he
will
do
in
the
preface
observe
the
date
of
publication
also
in
order
to
get
an
idea
as
to
the
recency
of
the
material
glance
over
the
table
of
contents
if
you
are
very
familiar
with
the
field
and
the
table
of
contents
is
outlined
in
detail
you
might
advantageously
study
it
and
dispense
with
reading
the
book
on
the
other
hand
if
you
are
going
to
consult
the
book
only
briefly
you
might
find
it
necessary
to
study
the
table
of
contents
in
order
to
see
the
relation
of
the
part
you
read
to
the
entire
work
use
the
index
intelligently
it
may
save
you
much
time
you
will
have
much
to
do
throughout
your
college
course
with
the
making
of
bibliographies
that
is
with
the
compilation
of
lists
of
books
bearing
upon
special
topics
you
may
have
bibliographies
given
you
in
some
of
your
courses
or
you
may
be
asked
to
compile
your
own
under
all
circumstances
prepare
them
with
the
greatest
care
be
scrupulous
in
giving
references
there
is
a
standard
form
for
referring
to
books
and
periodicals
as

the
form
for
laboratory
notes
varies
with
the

and
is

by
the
instructor

of

are

when

attention
to

instructors
say
that
the
greatest
fault
with
laboratory
is
lack
of
neatness
this
reacts
upon
the
instructor
causing
him
much
trouble
in
correcting
the
the
resulting
annoyance
frequently
prejudices
him
against
his
will
against
the
student
it
is
safe
to
assert
that
you
will
materially
increase
your
chances
of
a
good
grade
in
a

aim
in

and
there
is
much
opportunity
for
applying
it
in
so

these
that

is
an
art
and
as
you
practise
you
will
develop
skill
we
have
noted
some
of
the
most
obvious
and
immediate
benefits
derived
from
notes
consisting
of
economy
of

ease
of

ease
of

there
are
other
benefits

which

greater
importance
these
are
the
permanent
effects
upon
the

chief
result
of

brain
action
during
study
though
most
people
understand
more
or
less
vaguely
that
the
brain
acts
in
some
way
during
study
exact
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
this
action
is
not
general
as
you
will
be
greatly
assisted
in
understanding
mental
processes
by
such
knowledge
we
shall
briefly
examine
the
brain
and
its
connections
it
will
be
manifestly
impossible
to
inquire
into
its
nature
very
minutely
but
by
means
of
a
description
you
will
be
able
to
secure
some
conception
of
it
and
thus
will
be
able
better
to
control
the
mental
processes
which
it
underlies
to
the
naked
eye
the
brain
is
a
large
mass
enclosed
in
a
bony
covering
about
of
an
inch
thick
called
the
skull
inside
the
skull
it
is
protected
by
a
thick
membrane
at
its
base
emerges
the
spinal
cord
a
long
strand
of
nerve
fibers
extending
down
the
spine
for
most
of
its
length
the
cord
is
about
as
large
around
as
your
little
finger
but
it
tapers
at
the
lower
end
from
it
at
right
angles
throughout
its
length
branch
out
pairs
of
fibrous
nerves
which
radiate
to
all
parts
of
the
body
the
brain
and
spinal
cord
with
all
its
ramifications
are
known
as
the
nervous
system
you
see
now
that
though
we
started
with
the
statement
that
the
mind
is
intimately
connected
with
the
brain
we
must
now
enlarge
our
statement
and
say
it
is
connected
with
the
entire
nervous
system
it
is
therefore
to
the
nervous
system
that
we
must
turn
our
attention
although
to
the
naked
eye
the
nervous
system
is
apparently
made
up
of
a
number
of
different
kinds
of
material
still
we
see
when
we
turn
our
microscopes
upon
it
that
its
parts
are
structurally
the
same
reduced
to
lowest
terms
the
nervous
system
is
found
to
be
composed
of
minute
units
of
structure
called
or
neurones
each
of
these
looks
like
a
string
frayed
out
at
both
ends
with
a
bulge
somewhere
along
its
length
the
nervous
system
is
made
up
of
millions
of
these
little
cells
packed
together
in
various
combinations
and
distributed
throughout
the
body
some
of
the
neurones
are
as
long
as
three
feet
others
measure
but
a
fraction
of
an
inch
in
length
we
do
not
know
exactly
how
the
mind
that
part
of
us
which
feels
reasons
and
wills
is
connected
with
this
mass
of
cells
called
the
nervous
system
we
do
know
however
that
every
time
anything
occurs
in
the
mind
there
is
a
change
in
some
part
of
the
nervous
system
applying
this
fact
to
study
it
is
obvious
that
when
you
are
performing
any
of
the
operations
of
study
memorizing
foreign
vocabularies
making
arithmetical
calculations
reasoning
out
problems
in
geometry
you
are
making
changes
in
your
nervous
system
the
question
before
us
then
is
what
is
the
nature
of
these
changes
according
to
present
knowledge
the
action
of
the
nervous
system
is
best
conceived
as
a
form
of
chemical
change
that
spreads
among
the
we
call
this
commotion
the
nervous
current
it
is
very
rapid
moving
faster
than
one
hundred
feet
a
second
and
runs
along
the
cells
in
much
the
same
way
as
a
spark
runs
along
a
train
of
gunpowder
it
is
important
to
note
that
neurones
never
act
singly
they
always
act
in
groups
the
nervous
current
passing
from
neurone
to
neurone
it
is
thought
that
the
most
important
changes
in
the
nervous
system
do
not
occur
within
the
individual
neurones
but
at
the
points
where
they
join
with
each
other
this
point
of
connection
is
called
the
synapse
and
although
we
do
not
understand
its
exact
nature
it
may
well
be
pictured
as
a
valve
that
governs
the
passage
of
the
nervous
current
from
neurone
to
neurone
at
time
of
birth
most
of
the
valves
are
closed
only
a
few
are
open
mainly
those
connected
with
the
vegetative
processes
such
as
breathing
and
digestion
but
as
the
individual
is
played
upon
by
the
objects
of
the
environment
the
valves
open
to
the
passage
of
the
nervous
current
with
increased
use
they
become
more
and
more
permeable
and
thus
learning
is
the
process
of
making
easier
the
passage
of
the
nervous
current
from
one
neurone
to
another
we
shall
secure
further
light
upon
the
action
of
the
nervous
system
if
we
examine
some
of
the
properties
belonging
to
the
first
one
is
are
very
sensitive
to
impressions
from
the
outside
if
you
have
ever
had
the
dentist
touch
an
exposed
nerve
you
know
how
extreme
this
sensitivity
is
naturally
such
a
property
is
very
important
in
education
for
had
we
not
the
power
to
receive
impressions
from
the
outside
world
we
should
not
be
able
to
acquire
knowledge
we
should
not
even
be
able
to
perceive
danger
and
remove
ourselves
from
harm
if
we
compare
a
man
body
to
a
building
calling
the
steel
his
skeleton
and
the
furnace
and
power
station
his
digestive
organs
and
lungs
the
nervous
system
would
include
with
other
things
the
thermometers
heat
regulators
electric
buttons
the
parts
of
the
building
in
short
which
are
specifically
designed
to
respond
to
influences
of
the
environment
the
second
property
of
which
is
important
in
study
is
as
soon
as
a
neurone
is
stimulated
at
one
end
it
communicates
its
excitement
by
means
of
the
nervous
current
to
the
next
neurone
or
to
neighboring
neurones
just
as
an
electric
current
might
pass
along
one
wire
thence
to
another
and
along
it
to
a
third
so
the
nervous
current
passes
from
neurone
to
neurone
as
might
be
expected
the
two
functions
of
impressibility
and
conductivity
are
aided
by
such
an
arrangement
of
the
that
the
nervous
current
may
pass
over
definitely
laid
pathways
these
systems
of
pathways
will
be
described
in
a
later
paragraph
the
third
property
of
which
is
important
in
study
is
that
is
impressions
made
upon
the
are
retained
most
living
tissue
is
modifiable
to
some
extent
the
features
of
the
face
are
modifiable
and
if
one
habitually
assumes
a
peevish
expression
it
becomes
after
a
time
permanently
fixed
the
nervous
system
however
possesses
the
power
of
modifiability
to
a
marked
degree
even
a
single
impression
sufficing
to
make
striking
modification
this
is
very
important
in
study
being
the
basis
for
the
retentive
powers
of
the
mind
having
examined
the
action
of
the
nervous
system
in
its
simplicity
we
have
now
to
examine
the
ways
in
which
the
parts
of
the
nervous
system
are
combined
we
shall
be
helped
if
we
keep
to
the
conception
of
it
as
an
aggregation
of
systems
or
groups
of
pathways
some
of
these
we
shall
attempt
to
trace
out
beginning
with
those
at
the
outermost
parts
of
the
body
we
find
them
located
in
the
not
only
within
the
traditional
five
but
also
within
the
muscles
tendons
joints
and
internal
organs
of
the
body
such
as
the
heart
and
digestive
organs
in
all
these
places
we
find
ends
of
neurones
which
converge
at
the
spinal
cord
and
travel
to
the
brain
they
are
called
sensory
neurones
and
their
function
is
to
carry
messages
inward
to
the
brain
thus
the
brain
represents
in
great
part
a
central
receiving
station
for
impressions
from
the
outside
world
the
carrying
messages
from
the
various
parts
of
the
body
terminate
in
particular
areas
thus
an
area
in
the
back
part
of
the
brain
receives
messages
from
the
eyes
another
area
near
the
top
of
the
brain
receives
messages
from
the
skin
these
areas
are
quite
clearly
marked
out
and
may
be
studied
in
detail
by
means
of
the
accompanying
diagram
there
is
another
large
group
of
which
when
traced
out
are
found
to
have
one
terminal
in
the
brain
and
the
other
in
the
muscles
throughout
the
body
the
area
in
the
brain
where
these
neurones
emerge
is
near
the
top
of
the
brain
in
the
area
marked
on
the
diagram
from
here
the
fibers
travel
down
through
the
spinal
cord
and
out
to
the
muscles
the
in
this
group
are
called
motor
neurones
and
their
function
is
to
carry
messages
from
the
brain
out
to
the
muscles
for
a
muscle
ordinarily
does
not
act
without
a
nervous
current
to
set
it
off
so
far
we
have
seen
that
the
brain
has
the
two
functions
of
receiving
impressions
from
the
and
of
sending
out
orders
to
the
muscles
there
is
a
further
mechanism
that
must
now
be
described
when
messages
are
received
in
the
sensory
areas
it
is
necessary
that
there
be
some
means
within
the
brain
of
transmitting
them
over
to
the
motor
area
so
that
they
may
be
acted
upon
such
an
arrangement
is
provided
by
another
group
of
in
the
brain
having
as
their
function
the
transmission
of
the
nervous
current
from
one
area
to
another
they
are
called
association
neurones
and
transmit
the
nervous
current
from
sensory
areas
to
motor
areas
or
from
one
sensory
area
to
another
for
example
suppose
you
see
a
brick
falling
from
above
and
you
dodge
quickly
back
the
neural
action
accompanying
this
occurrence
consists
of
an
impression
upon
the
in
the
eye
the
conduction
of
the
nervous
current
back
to
the
visual
area
of
the
brain
the
transmission
of
the
current
over
association
neurones
to
the
motor
area
then
its
transmission
over
the
motor
neurones
down
the
spinal
cord
to
the
muscles
that
enable
you
to
dodge
the
missile
the
association
neurones
have
the
further
function
of
connecting
one
sensory
area
in
the
brain
with
another
for
example
when
you
see
smell
taste
and
touch
an
orange
the
corresponding
areas
in
the
brain
act
in
conjunction
and
are
associated
by
means
of
the
association
neurones
connecting
them
the
association
neurones
play
a
large
part
in
the
securing
and
organizing
of
knowledge
they
are
very
important
in
study
for
all
learning
consists
in
building
up
associations
from
the
foregoing
description
we
see
that
the
nervous
system
consists
merely
of
a
mechanism
for
the
reception
and
transmission
of
incoming
messages
and
their
transformation
into
outgoing
messages
which
produce
movement
the
brain
is
the
center
where
such
transformations
are
made
being
a
sort
of
central
switchboard
which
permits
the
to
come
into
communication
with
muscles
it
is
also
the
instrument
by
means
of
which
the
impressions
from
the
various
senses
can
be
united
and
experience
can
be
unified
the
brain
serves
further
as
the
medium
whereby
impressions
once
made
can
be
retained
that
is
it
is
the
great
organ
of
memory
hence
we
see
that
it
is
to
this
organ
we
must
look
for
the
performance
of
the
activities
necessary
to
study
everything
that
enters
it
produces
some
modification
within
it
education
consists
in
a
process
of
undergoing
a
selected
group
of
experiences
of
such
a
nature
as
to
leave
beneficial
results
in
the
brain
by
means
of
the
changes
made
there
the
individual
is
able
better
to
adjust
himself
to
new
situations
for
when
the
individual
enters
the
world
he
is
not
prepared
to
meet
many
situations
only
a
few
of
the
neural
connections
are
made
and
he
is
able
to
perform
only
a
meagre
number
of
simple
acts
such
as
breathing
crying
digestion
the
pathways
for
complex
acts
such
as
speaking
english
or
french
or
writing
are
not
formed
at
birth
but
must
be
built
up
within
the
of
the
individual
it
is
the
process
of
building
them
up
that
we
call
education
this
process
is
a
physical
feat
involving
the
production
of
changes
in
physical
material
in
the
brain
study
involves
the
overcoming
of
resistance
in
the
nervous
system
that
is
why
it
is
so
hard
in
your
early
when
you
set
about
laboriously
learning
the
multiplication
table
your
unwilling
protests
were
wrung
because
you
were
being
compelled
to
force
the
nervous
current
through
new
pathways
and
to
overcome
the
inertia
of
physical
matter
today
when
you
begin
a
train
of
reasoning
the
task
is
difficult
because
you
are
opening
hitherto
untravelled
pathways
there
is
a
comforting
thought
however
which
is
derived
from
the
factor
of
modifiability
in
that
with
each
succeeding
repetition
the
task
becomes
easier
because
the
path
becomes
worn
smoothly
and
the
nervous
current
seeks
it
of
its
own
accord
in
other
words
each
act
and
each
thought
tends
to
become
habitualized
education
is
then
a
process
of
forming
habits
and
the
rest
of
the
book
will
be
devoted
to
the
description
and
discussion
of
habits
which
a
student
should
form

iv
formation
of
as
already
intimated
this
book
adopts
the
view
that
education
is
a
process
of
forming
habits
in
the
brain
in
the
formation
of
habits
there
are
several
principles
that
must
be
observed
accordingly
we
shall
devote
a
chapter
to
the
consideration
of
habits
in
general
before
discussing
the
specific
habits
involved
in
various
kinds
of
study
habit
may
be
defined
roughly
as
the
tendency
to
act
time
after
time
in
the
same
way
thus
defined
you
see
that
the
force
of
habit
extends
throughout
the
entire
universe
it
is
a
habit
for
the
earth
to
revolve
on
its
axis
once
every
hours
and
to
encircle
the
sun
once
every
year
when
a
pencil
falls
from
your
hand
it
has
a
habit
of
dropping
to
the
floor
a
piece
of
paper
once
folded
tends
to
crease
in
the
same
place
these
are
examples
of
the
force
of
habit
in
nonliving
matter
living
matter
shows
its
power
even
more
clearly
if
you
assume
a
petulant
expression
for
some
time
it
gets
fixed
and
the
expression
becomes
habitual
the
hair
may
be
trained
to
lie
this
way
or
that
these
are
examples
of
habit
in
living
tissue
but
there
is
one
particular
form
of
living
tissue
which
is
most
susceptible
to
habit
that
is
nerve
tissue
let
us
review
briefly
the
facts
which
underlie
this
characteristic
in
nerve
tissue
impressibility
conductivity
and
modifiability
are
developed
to
a
marked
degree
the
in
the
sense
organs
are
impressed
by
stimulations
from
the
outside
world
the
nervous
current
thus
generated
is
conducted
over
long
nerve
fibers
through
the
spinal
cord
to
the
brain
where
it
is
received
and
we
experience
a
sensation
thence
it
pushes
on
over
association
neurones
in
the
brain
to
motor
neurones
over
which
it
passes
down
the
spinal
cord
again
to
muscles
and
ends
in
some
movement
in
the
pathway
which
it
traverses
it
leaves
its
impression
and
thereafter
when
the
first
neurone
is
excited
the
nervous
current
tends
to
take
the
same
pathway
and
to
end
in
the
same
movement
it
should
be
emphasized
that
the
nervous
current
once
started
always
tends
to
seek
outlet
in
movement
this
is
an
extremely
important
feature
of
neural
action
and
as
will
be
shown
in
another
chapter
is
a
vital
factor
in
study
movement
may
be
started
by
the
stimulation
of
a
sense
organ
or
by
an
idea
in
the
latter
case
it
starts
from
regions
in
the
brain
without
the
immediately
preceding
stimulation
of
a
sense
organ
howsoever
it
starts
you
may
be
sure
that
it
seeks
a
way
out
and
prefers
pathways
already
traversed
hence
you
see
you
are
bound
to
have
habits
they
will
develop
whether
you
wish
them
or
not
already
you
are
a
bundle
of
habits
they
manifest
themselves
in
two
ways
as
habits
of
action
and
habits
of
thought
you
illustrate
the
first
every
time
you
tie
your
shoes
or
sign
your
name
to
illustrate
the
second
i
need
only
ask
you
to
supply
the
end
of
this
sentence
columbus
discovered
america
in
speech
reveals
many
of
these
habits
of
thought
certain
phrases
persist
in
the
mind
as
habits
so
that
when
the
phrase
is
once
begun
you
proceed
habitually
with
the
rest
of
it
when
some
one
starts
in
spite
your
mind
goes
on
to
think
of
more
or
calls
up
less
when
i
ask
you
what
word
is
called
up
by
black
you
reply
white
according
to
the
principles
of
mental
habit
your
mind
is
arranged
in
such
habitual
patterns
and
from
these
examples
you
readily
see
that
a
large
part
of
what
you
do
and
think
during
the
course
of
hours
is
habitual
twenty
years
hence
you
will
be
even
more
bound
by
this
overpowering
despot
our
acts
our
angels
are
or
good
or
ill
our
constant
shadows
that
walk
with
us
still
since
you
can
not
avoid
forming
habits
how
important
it
is
that
you
seek
to
form
those
that
are
useful
and
desirable
in
acquiring
them
there
are
several
general
principles
deducible
from
the
facts
of
nervous
action
the
first
is
guard
the
pathways
leading
to
the
brain
nerve
tissue
is
impressible
and
everything
that
touches
it
leaves
an
ineradicable
trace
you
can
control
your
habits
to
some
extent
then
by
observing
caution
in
permitting
things
to
impress
you
many
unfortunate
habits
of
study
arise
from
neglect
of
this
the
habit
of
using
a
pony
for
example
arises
when
one
permits
oneself
to
depend
upon
a
group
of
english
words
in
translating
from
a
foreign
language
nerve
pathways
should
then
be
guarded
with
respect
to
enters
they
should
also
be
guarded
with
respect
to
the
things
enter
remember
as
the
first
pathway
is
cut
subsequent
nervous
currents
will
be
directed
consequently
if
you
make
a
wrong
pathway
you
will
have
trouble
undoing
it
another
maxim
which
will
obviously
prevent
undesirable
pathways
is
go
slowly
at
first
this
is
an
important
principle
in
all
learning
if
when
trying
to
learn
the
date
you
carelessly
impress
it
first
as
you
are
likely
to
have
trouble
ever
after
in
remembering
which
is
right
or
as
you
value
your
intellectual
salvation
then
go
slowly
in
making
the
first
impression
and
be
sure
it
is
right
the
next
rule
is
guard
the
exits
of
the
nervous
currents
that
is
watch
the
movements
you
make
in
response
to
impressions
and
ideas
this
is
necessary
because
the
nervous
current
pushes
on
past
obstructions
through
areas
in
the
brain
until
it
ends
in
some
form
of
movement
and
in
finding
the
way
out
it
seeks
those
pathways
that
have
been
most
frequently
travelled
in
study
it
usually
takes
the
form
of
movements
of
speech
or
writing
you
will
need
to
guard
this
part
of
the
process
just
as
you
did
the
incoming
pathway
you
must
see
that
the
movement
is
made
which
you
wish
to
build
into
a
habit
in
learning
the
pronunciation
of
a
foreign
word
for
example
see
that
your
first
pronunciation
of
it
is
absolutely
right
when
learning
to
typewrite
see
that
you
always
hit
the
right
key
during
the
early
trials
the
point
of
exit
of
a
nervous
current
is
the
point
also
where
precautions
are
to
be
taken
in
developing
good
form
the
path
should
be
the
shortest
possible
involving
only
those
muscles
that
are
absolutely
necessary
this
makes
for
economy
of
effort
the
third
general
principle
to
be
kept
in
mind
is
that
habits
are
most
easily
formed
in
youth
for
this
is
the
period
when
nerve
tissue
is
most
easily
impressed
and
modified
with
respect
to
habit
formation
then
you
see
that
youth
is
the
time
when
emphasis
should
be
laid
upon
the
formation
of
as
many
useful
habits
as
possible
the
world
recognizes
this
to
some
extent
and
society
is
so
organized
that
the
youth
of
the
race
are
given
leisure
and
protection
so
that
they
may
form
useful
habits
the
world
asks
nothing
of
you
during
the
next
four
years
except
that
you
develop
yourself
and
form
useful
habits
which
will
enable
you
in
later
life
to
take
your
place
as
a
useful
and
stable
member
of
society
in
addition
to
the
principles
just
discussed
there
are
a
number
of
other
maxims
which
have
been
laid
down
as
guides
in
the
formation
of
new
habits
the
first
is
an
assertion
of
vow
to
yourself
that
you
will
form
the
habit
and
keep
that
resolve
ever
before
you
the
second
maxim
is
an
emphatic
surround
yourself
with
every
aid
possible
make
it
easy
at
first
to
perform
the
act
and
difficult
not
to
perform
it
for
example
if
you
desire
to
form
the
habit
of
arising
at
six
every
morning
surround
yourself
with
a
number
of
aids
buy
an
alarm
clock
and
tell
some
one
of
your
decision
such
efforts
at
the
start
will
give
your
new
beginning
such
a
momentum
that
the
temptation
to
break
down
will
not
occur
as
soon
as
it
otherwise
might
and
every
day
during
which
a
breakdown
is
postponed
adds
to
the
chances
of
its
not
occurring
at
all
man
has
discovered
the
value
of
such
devices
during
the
course
of
his
long
history
and
has
evolved
customs
accordingly
when
men
decide
to
swear
off
smoking
they
choose
the
opening
of
a
new
year
when
many
other
new
things
are
being
started
they
make
solemn
promises
to
themselves
to
each
other
and
finally
to
their
friends
such
customs
are
precautions
which
help
to
bolster
up
the
determination
at
the
time
when
extraordinary
effort
and
determination
are
required
in
forming
the
habits
incidental
to
college
life
take
pains
from
the
start
to
surround
yourself
with
as
many
aids
as
possible
this
will
not
constitute
a
confession
of
weakness
it
is
only
a
wise
and
natural
precaution
which
the
whole
experience
of
the
race
has
justified
the
third
maxim
is
permit
an
exception
to
suppose
you
have
a
habit
of
saying
aint
which
you
wish
to
replace
with
a
habit
of
saying
is
if
the
habit
is
deeply
rooted
you
have
worn
a
pathway
in
the
brain
to
a
considerable
depth
represented
in
the
accompanying
diagram
by
the
line
x
a
x
b
c
let
us
suppose
that
you
have
already
started
the
new
habit
and
have
said
the
correct
word
ten
times
that
means
you
have
worn
another
pathway
x
to
a
considerable
depth
during
all
this
time
however
the
old
pathway
is
still
open
and
at
the
slightest
provocation
will
attract
the
nervous
current
your
task
is
to
deepen
the
new
path
so
that
the
nervous
current
will
flow
into
it
instead
of
the
old
now
suppose
you
make
an
exception
on
some
occasion
and
allow
the
nervous
current
to
travel
over
the
old
path
this
unfortunate
exception
breaks
down
the
bridge
which
you
had
constructed
at
from
to
but
this
is
not
the
only
result
the
nervous
current
as
it
revisits
the
old
path
deepens
it
more
than
it
was
before
so
the
next
time
a
similar
situation
arises
the
current
seeks
the
old
path
with
much
greater
readiness
than
before
and
vastly
more
effort
is
required
to
overcome
it
some
one
has
likened
the
effect
of
these
exceptions
to
that
produced
when
one
drops
a
ball
of
string
that
is
partially
wound
by
a
single
slip
more
is
undone
than
can
be
accomplished
in
a
dozen
windings
the
fourth
maxim
is
every
opportunity
to
act
upon
your
the
reason
for
this
will
be
understood
better
if
you
keep
in
mind
the
fact
stated
before
that
nervous
currents
once
started
whether
from
a
or
from
a
always
tend
to
seek
egress
in
movement
these
outgoing
nervous
currents
leave
an
imprint
upon
the
modifiable
nerve
tissues
as
inevitably
as
do
incoming
impressions
therefore
if
you
wish
your
resolves
to
be
firmly
fixed
you
should
act
upon
them
speedily
and
often
it
is
not
in
the
moment
of
their
forming
but
in
the
moment
of
their
producing
that
resolves
and
aspirations
communicate
the
new
to
the
brain
no
matter
how
full
a
reservoir
of
one
may
possess
and
no
matter
how
good
one
may
be
if
one
has
not
taken
advantage
of
every
concrete
opportunity
to
one
character
may
remain
entirely
unaffected
for
the
better
particularly
at
time
of
emotional
excitement
one
makes
resolves
that
are
very
good
and
a
glow
of
fine
feeling
is
present
beware
that
these
resolves
do
not
evaporate
in
mere
feeling
they
should
be
crystallized
in
some
form
of
action
as
soon
as
possible
let
the
expression
be
the
least
thing
in
the
world
speaking
genially
to
one
grandmother
or
giving
up
one
seat
in
a
car
if
nothing
more
heroic
offers
but
let
it
not
fail
to
take
place
strictly
speaking
you
have
not
really
completed
a
resolve
until
you
have
acted
upon
it
you
may
determine
to
go
without
lunch
but
you
have
not
consummated
that
resolve
until
you
have
permitted
it
to
express
itself
by
carrying
you
past
the
door
of
the
that
is
the
crucial
test
which
determines
the
strength
of
your
resolve
many
repetitions
will
be
required
before
a
pathway
is
worn
deep
enough
to
be
settled
seize
the
very
earliest
opportunity
to
begin
grooving
it
out
and
seize
every
other
opportunity
for
deepening
it
after
this
view
of
the
place
in
your
life
occupied
by
habit
you
readily
see
its
possibilities
for
welfare
of
body
and
mind
its
most
obvious
because
most
annoying
effects
are
on
the
side
of
its
disadvantages
bad
habits
secure
a
grip
upon
us
that
we
are
sometimes
powerless
to
shake
off
true
this
ineradicableness
need
have
no
terrors
if
we
have
formed
good
habits
indeed
as
will
be
pointed
out
in
the
next
paragraph
habit
may
be
a
great
asset
nevertheless
it
may
work
positive
harm
or
at
best
may
lead
to
stagnation
the
fixedness
of
habit
tends
to
make
us
move
in
ruts
unless
we
exert
continuous
effort
to
learn
new
things
if
we
permit
ourselves
to
move
in
old
grooves
we
cease
to
progress
and
become
old
fogy
but
the
advantages
of
habit
far
outweigh
its
disadvantages
habit
helps
the
individual
to
be
consistent
and
helps
people
to
know
what
to
expect
from
one
it
helps
society
to
be
stable
to
incorporate
within
itself
modes
of
action
conducive
to
the
common
good
for
example
the
respect
which
we
all
have
for
the
property
of
others
is
a
habit
and
is
so
firmly
intrenched
that
we
should
find
ourselves
unable
to
steal
if
we
wished
to
habit
is
thus
a
very
desirable
asset
and
is
truly
called
the
enormous
of
society
a
second
advantage
of
habit
is
that
it
makes
for
accuracy
acts
that
have
become
habitualized
are
performed
more
accurately
than
those
not
habitualized
movements
such
as
those
made
in
typewriting
and
when
measured
in
the
psychological
laboratory
are
found
to
copy
each
other
with
extreme
fidelity
the
human
body
is
a
machine
which
may
be
adjusted
to
a
high
degree
of
nicety
and
habit
is
the
mechanism
by
which
this
adjustment
is
made
a
third
advantage
is
that
a
stock
of
habits
makes
life
easier
there
is
no
more
miserable
human
being
than
one
in
whom
nothing
is
habitual
but
indecision
for
whom
the
lighting
of
every
cigar
the
drinking
of
every
cup
the
time
of
rising
and
going
to
bed
every
day
and
the
beginning
of
every
bit
of
work
are
subjects
of
express
volitional
deliberation
full
half
the
time
of
such
a
man
goes
to
the
deciding
or
regretting
of
matters
which
ought
to
be
so
ingrained
in
him
as
practically
not
to
exist
for
his
consciousness
at
all
have
you
ever
reflected
how
miserable
you
would
be
and
what
a
task
living
would
be
if
you
had
to
learn
to
write
anew
every
morning
when
you
go
to
class
or
if
you
had
to
relearn
how
to
tie
your
necktie
every
day
the
burden
of
living
would
be
intolerable
the
last
advantage
to
be
discerned
in
habit
is
economy
habitual
acts
do
not
have
to
be
actively
directed
by
consciousness
while
they
are
being
performed
consciousness
may
be
otherwise
engaged
the
more
of
the
details
of
our
daily
life
we
can
hand
over
to
the
effortless
custody
of
automatism
the
more
our
higher
powers
of
mind
will
be
set
free
for
their
own
proper
work
while
you
are
brushing
your
hair
or
tying
your
shoes
your
mind
may
be
engaged
in
memorizing
poetry
or
calculating
arithmetical
problems
habit
is
thus
a
great
economizer
the
ethical
consequences
of
habit
are
so
striking
that
before
leaving
the
subject
we
must
give
them
acknowledgment
we
can
do
no
better
than
to
turn
to
the
statement
by
professor
james
whose
wise
remarks
upon
the
subject
have
not
been
improved
upon
the
physiological
study
of
mental
conditions
is
thus
the
most
powerful
ally
of
hortatory
ethics
the
hell
to
be
endured
hereafter
of
which
theology
tells
is
no
worse
than
the
hell
we
make
for
ourselves
in
this
world
by
habitually
fashioning
our
characters
in
the
wrong
way
could
the
young
but
realize
how
soon
they
will
become
mere
walking
bundles
of
habits
they
would
give
more
heed
to
their
conduct
while
in
the
plastic
state
we
are
spinning
our
own
fates
good
or
evil
and
never
to
be
undone
every
smallest
stroke
of
virtue
or
of
vice
leaves
its
scar
the
drunken
rip
van
winkle
in
jefferson
play
excuses
himself
for
every
fresh
dereliction
by
saying
wo
count
this
time
well
he
may
not
count
it
and
a
kind
heaven
may
not
count
it
but
it
is
being
counted
none
the
less
down
among
his
and
fibers
the
molecules
are
counting
it
registering
it
and
storing
it
up
to
be
used
against
him
when
the
next
temptation
comes
nothing
we
ever
do
is
in
strict
scientific
literalness
wiped
out
of
course
this
has
its
good
side
as
well
as
its
bad
one
as
we
become
permanent
drunkards
by
so
many
drinks
so
we
become
saints
in
the
moral
and
authorities
and
experts
in
the
practical
and
scientific
spheres
by
so
many
separate
acts
and
hours
of
work
but
let
no
youth
have
any
anxiety
about
the
upshot
of
his
education
whatever
the
line
of
it
may
be
if
he
keep
faithfully
busy
each
hour
of
the
working
day
he
may

chapter
v
active
imagination
a
very
large
part
of
the
mental
life
of
a
student
consists
in
the
manipulation
of
images
by
images
we
mean
the
revivals
of
things
that
have
been
impressed
upon
the
senses
call
to
mind
for
the
moment
your
as
it
appears
upon
the
door
of
your
home
in
so
doing
you
mentally
reinstate
something
which
has
been
impressed
upon
your
senses
many
times
and
you
see
it
almost
as
clearly
as
if
it
were
actually
before
you
the
mental
thing
thus
revived
is
called
an
image
the
word
image
is
somewhat
for
it
usually
signifies
something
connected
with
the
eye
and
implies
that
the
stuff
of
mental
images
is
entirely
visual
the
true
fact
of
the
matter
is
we
can
image
practically
anything
that
we
can
sense
we
may
have
tactual
images
of
things
touched
auditory
images
of
things
heard
gustatory
images
of
things
tasted
olfactory
images
of
things
smelled
how
these
behave
in
general
and
how
they
interact
in
study
will
engage
our
attention
in
this
chapter
the
most
highly
dramatic
use
of
images
is
in
connection
with
that
mental
process
known
as
imagination
as
we
study
the
writings
of
jack
london
poe
defoe
bunyan
we
move
in
a
realm
almost
wholly
imaginary
and
as
we
take
a
of
our
minds
when
thus
engaged
we
find
them
filled
with
images
furthermore
they
are
of
great
variety
images
of
colors
sounds
tastes
smells
touches
even
of
sensations
from
our
own
internal
organs
such
as
the
palpitations
of
the
heart
that
accompany
feelings
of
pride
indignation
remorse
exaltation
a
further
characteristic
is
that
they
are
sharp
vivid
note
in
the
balcony
scene
from
romeo
and
juliet
the
number
variety
and
vividness
of
the
images
but
soft
what
light
through
yonder
window
breaks
it
is
the
east
and
juliet
is
the
sun
arise
fair
sun
and
kill
the
envious
moon
who
is
already
sick
and
pale
with
grief
that
thou
her
maid
art
far
more
fair
than
she
be
not
her
maid
since
she
is
envious
her
vestal
livery
is
but
sick
and
green
two
of
the
fairest
stars
in
all
the
heaven
having
some
business
do
entreat
her
eyes
to
twinkle
in
their
spheres
till
they
return
what
if
her
eyes
were
there
they
in
her
head
the
brightness
in
her
cheek
would
shame
those
stars
as
daylight
doth
a
lamp
her
eyes
in
heaven
would
through
the
airy
regions
stream
so
bright
that
birds
would
sing
and
think
it
were
not
night
see
how
she
leans
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
o
that
i
were
a
glove
upon
that
hand
that
i
might
touch
that
cheek
we
may
conclude
then
that
three
of
the
desirable
attributes
of
great
works
of
the
imagination
are
and
of
mental
images
one
question
that
frequently
arises
concerning
works
of
the
imagination
is
what
is
their
source
superficial
thinkers
have
loosely
answered
inspiration
implying
according
to
the
literal
meaning
of
the
word
to
breathe
in
that
some
mysterious
external
force
called
by
the
ancients
a
muse
enters
into
the
mind
of
the
author
with
a
special
revelation
psychological
analysis
of
these
imaginative
works
shows
that
this
explanation
is
untrue
that
the
bizarre
and
apparently
novel
products
arise
from
the
experiences
of
the
author
revived
in
imagination
and
combined
in
new
ways
the
horrendous
incidents
depicted
in
divine
comedy
never
occurred
within
the
lifetime
experience
of
the
author
as
such
their
separate
elements
did
however
and
furnished
the
basis
for
dante
clever
combinations
the
saying
that
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
is
psychologically
true
in
the
light
of
this
brief
analysis
of
products
of
the
imagination
we
are
ready
to
develop
a
program
which
we
may
follow
in
cultivating
an
active
imagination
recognizing
that
images
have
their
source
in
sensory
experience
we
see
that
the
first
step
to
take
is
to
seek
a
multitude
of
experiences
make
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
objects
of
your
environment
handle
them
tear
them
apart
put
them
together
place
them
next
to
other
objects
noting
the
likenesses
and
differences
thus
you
will
acquire
the
stuff
out
of
which
images
are
made
and
will
stock
your
mind
with
a
number
of
images
then
when
you
wish
to
convey
your
ideas
you
will
have
a
number
of
terms
in
which
to
do
it
one
of
the
characteristics
of
a
imagination
the
second
characteristic
we
found
to
be
variety
to
secure
this
seek
a
variety
of
sensational
experiences
perceive
the
objects
of
your
experience
through
several
senses
touch
smell
sight
hearing
taste
by
means
of
this
variety
in
sensations
you
will
secure
corresponding
variety
in
your
images
to
revive
them
easily
sometimes
requires
practice
for
it
has
been
discovered
that
all
people
do
not
naturally
call
up
images
related
to
the
various
senses
with
equal
ease
most
people
use
visual
and
auditory
images
more
freely
than
they
do
other
kinds
in
order
to
develop
skill
in
evoking
the
others
practise
recalling
them
sit
down
for
an
hour
of
practice
as
you
would
sit
down
for
an
hour
of
piano
practice
try
to
recall
the
taste
of
raisins
english
walnuts
the
smell
of
hyacinths
of
the
rough
touch
of
an
though
you
may
at
first
have
difficulty
you
will
develop
with
practice
a
gratifying
facility
in
recalling
all
varieties
of
images
the
third
characteristic
which
we
observed
in
works
of
the
imagination
is
vividness
to
achieve
this
pay
close
attention
to
the
details
of
your
sensory
experiences
observe
sharply
the
minute
but
characteristic
items
the
accent
mark
on
the
coarse
stubby
beard
of
the
typical
alley
tough
stock
your
mind
with
a
wealth
of
such
detailed
impressions
keep
them
alive
by
the
kind
of
practice
recommended
in
the
preceding
paragraph
then
describe
the
objects
of
your
experience
in
terms
of
these
significant
details
we
discovered
in
discussing
the
source
of
imaginative
works
that
the
men
whom
we
are
accustomed
to
call
imaginative
geniuses
do
not
have
unique
communication
with
heaven
or
with
any
external
reservoir
of
ideas
instead
we
found
their
creations
to
be
merely
new
combinations
of
old
images
the
true
secret
of
their
success
is
their
industrious
utilization
of
past
experiences
according
to
the
program
outlined
above
they
select
certain
elements
from
their
experiences
and
combine
them
in
novel
ways
this
is
the
explanation
of
their
strange
beautiful
and
bizarre
productions
this
is
what
carlyle
meant
when
he
characterized
genius
as
the
transcendent
capacity
for
taking
trouble
this
is
what
hogarth
meant
when
he
said
genius
is
nothing
but
labor
and
diligence
for
concrete
exemplification
of
this
truth
we
need
only
turn
to
the
autobiographies
of
great
writers
in
this
passage
from
john
barleycorn
jack
london
describes
his
methods
early
and
late
i
was
at
it
writing
typing
studying
grammar
studying
writing
and
all
forms
of
writing
and
studying
the
writers
who
succeeded
in
order
to
find
out
how
they
succeeded
i
managed
on
five
hours
sleep
in
the
and
came
pretty
close
to
working
the
nineteen
waking
hours
left
to
me
by
saying
that
the
novel
effects
of
imagination
come
by
way
of
industry
we
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
one
should
strain
after
novelty
and
eccentricity
unusual
and
happy
combinations
will
come
of
themselves
and
naturally
if
one
only
makes
a
sufficient
number
there
are
laws
of
combination
known
as
the
psychological
laws
of
association
by
which
images
will
unite
naturally
the
number
of
possible
combinations
is
infinite
by
industriously
making
a
large
number
you
will
by
the
very
laws
of
chance
stumble
upon
some
that
are
especially
happy
and
striking
in
summarizing
this
discussion
we
may
conclude
that
an
active
fertile
imagination
comes
from
crowding
into
one
life
a
large
number
of
varied
and
vivid
experiences
storing
them
up
in
the
mind
in
the
form
of
images
and
industriously
recalling
and
combining
them
in
novel
relationships
mental
images
occur
in
other
mental
processes
besides
imagination
they
bulk
importantly
in
memorizing
as
we
shall
see
in
chapters
vi
and
vii
and
in
reasoning
as
we
shall
see
in
chapter
ix
throughout
the
book
we
shall
find
that
as
we
develop
ability
to
manipulate
mental
images
we
shall
increase
the
adaptability
of
all
the
mental
processes

first
aids
to
memory
impression
of
all
the
mental
operations
employed
by
the
student
memory
is
probably
the
one
in
which
the
greatest
inefficiency
is
manifested
though
we
often
fail
to
realize
it
much
of
our
life
is
taken
up
with
memorizing
every
time
we
make
use
of
past
experience
we
rely
upon
this
function
of
the
mind
but
in
no
occupation
is
it
quite
so
practically
important
as
in
study
we
shall
begin
our
investigation
of
memory
by
dividing
it
into
four
phases
or
stages
impression
retention
recall
and
recognition
any
act
of
memory
involves
them
all
there
is
first
a
stage
when
the
material
is
being
impressed
second
a
stage
when
it
is
being
retained
so
that
it
may
be
revived
in
the
future
third
a
stage
of
recall
when
the
retained
material
is
revived
to
meet
present
needs
fourth
a
feeling
of
recognition
through
which
the
material
is
recognized
as
having
previously
been
in
the
mind
impression
is
accomplished
through
the
sense
organs
and
in
the
foregoing
chapter
we
laid
down
the
rule
guard
the
avenues
of
impression
and
admit
only
such
things
as
you
wish
to
retain
this
necessitates
that
you
go
slowly
at
first
this
is
a
principle
of
all
habit
formation
but
is
especially
important
in
habits
of
memorizing
much
of
the
poor
memory
that
people
complain
about
is
due
to
the
fact
that
they
make
first
impressions
carelessly
one
reason
why
people
fail
to
remember
names
is
that
they
do
not
get
a
clear
impression
of
the
name
at
the
start
they
are
introduced
in
a
hurry
or
the
introducer
mumbles
consequently
no
clear
impression
is
secured
under
such
circumstances
how
could
one
expect
to
retain
and
recall
the
name
go
slowly
then
in
impressing
material
for
the
first
time
as
you
look
up
the
words
of
a
foreign
language
in
the
lexicon
trying
to
memorize
their
english
equivalents
take
plenty
of
time
obtain
a
clear
impression
of
the
sound
and
appearance
of
the
words
inasmuch
as
impressions
may
be
made
through
any
of
the
sense
organs
one
problem
in
the
improvement
of
memory
concerns
the
choice
of
sense
avenues
as
an
infant
you
used
all
senses
impartially
in
your
eager
search
after
information
you
voraciously
put
things
into
your
mouth
and
discovered
that
some
things
were
sweet
some
sour
you
bumped
your
head
against
things
and
learned
that
some
were
hard
and
some
soft
in
your
insatiable
curiosity
you
pulled
things
apart
and
peered
into
them
in
short
utilized
all
the
sense
organs
in
adult
life
however
and
in
education
as
it
takes
place
through
the
agency
of
books
and
instructors
most
learning
depends
upon
the
eye
and
ear
even
yet
however
you
learn
many
things
through
the
sense
of
touch
and
through
muscle
movement
though
you
may
be
unaware
of
it
you
probably
have
better
success
retaining
impressions
made
upon
one
sense
than
another
the
majority
of
people
retain
better
things
that
are
visually
impressed
such
persons
think
often
in
terms
of
visual
images
when
thinking
of
water
running
from
a
faucet
they
can
see
the
water
fall
see
it
splash
but
have
no
trace
of
the
sound
the
whole
event
is
noiseless
in
memory
when
they
think
of
their
instructor
they
can
see
him
standing
at
his
desk
but
can
not
imagine
the
sound
of
his
voice
when
striving
to
think
of
the
causes
leading
to
the
civil
war
they
picture
them
as
they
are
listed
on
the
page
of
the
or
other
people
have
not
this
ability
to
recall
in
visual
terms
but
depend
to
greater
extent
upon
sounds
when
asked
to
think
about
their
instructor
they
do
it
in
terms
of
his
voice
when
asked
to
conjugate
a
french
verb
they
hear
it
pronounced
mentally
but
do
not
see
it
on
the
page
these
are
extremes
of
imagery
type
but
they
illustrate
preferences
as
they
are
found
in
many
persons
some
persons
use
all
senses
with
ease
others
unconsciously
work
out
combinations
preferring
one
sense
for
some
kinds
of
material
and
another
for
other
kinds
for
example
one
might
prefer
visual
impression
for
remembering
dates
in
history
but
auditory
impression
for
conjugating
french
verbs
you
will
find
it
profitable
to
examine
yourself
and
discover
your
preferences
if
you
find
that
you
have
greater
difficulty
in
remembering
material
impressed
through
the
ear
than
through
the
eye
reduce
things
to
visual
terms
as
much
as
possible
make
your
lecture
notes
more
complete
or
tabulate
things
that
you
wish
to
remember
thus
securing
impression
from
the
written
form
the
writer
has
difficulty
in
remembering
names
that
are
only
heard
so
he
asks
that
the
name
be
spelled
then
projects
the
letters
on
an
imaginary
background
thus
forming
visual
stuff
which
can
easily
be
recalled
if
on
the
contrary
you
remember
best
the
things
that
you
hear
you
may
find
it
a
good
plan
to
read
your
lessons
aloud
many
a
student
upon
the
discovery
of
such
a
preference
has
increased
his
memory
ability
many
fold
by
adopting
the
simple
expedient
of
reading
his
lessons
aloud
it
might
be
pointed
out
that
while
you
are
reading
aloud
you
are
making
more
than
auditory
impressions
by
the
use
of
the
vocal
organs
you
are
making
muscular
impressions
which
also
aid
in
learning
as
will
be
pointed
out
in
chapter
x
after
this
discussion
do
not
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
just
because
you
find
some
difficulty
in
using
one
sense
avenue
for
impression
it
is
therefore
impossible
to
develop
it
facility
in
using
particular
senses
can
be
gained
by
practice
to
improve
ability
to
form
visual
images
of
things
practise
calling
up
visions
of
things
try
to
picture
a
page
of
your
history
textbook
can
you
see
the
headlines
of
the
sections
and
the
paragraphs
to
develop
auditory
imagery
practise
calling
up
sounds
try
to
image
your
french
instructor
voice
in
saying
the
development
of
these
sense
fields
is
a
slow
and
laborious
process
and
one
questions
whether
it
is
worth
while
for
a
student
to
undertake
the
labor
involved
when
another
sense
is
already
very
efficient
probably
it
is
most
economical
to
arrange
impressions
so
as
to
favor
the
sense
that
is
already
well
developed
and
reliable
another
important
condition
of
impression
is
repetition
it
is
well
known
that
material
which
is
repeated
several
times
is
remembered
more
easily
than
that
impressed
but
once
if
two
repetitions
induce
a
given
liability
to
recall
four
or
eight
will
secure
still
greater
liability
of
recall
your
knowledge
of
brain
action
makes
this
rule
intelligible
because
you
know
the
pathway
is
deepened
every
time
the
nervous
current
passes
over
it
experiments
in
the
psychological
laboratory
have
shown
that
it
is
best
in
making
impressions
to
make
more
than
enough
impressions
to
insure
recall
if
material
is
to
be
retained
for
any
length
of
time
a
simple
mastery
of
it
for
immediate
recall
is
not
sufficient
it
should
be
learned
far
beyond
the
point
of
immediate
reproduction
if
time
and
energy
are
to
be
saved
this
principle
of
learning
points
out
the
fact
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
memory
immediate
and
deferred
the
first
kind
involves
recall
immediately
after
impression
is
made
the
second
involves
recall
at
some
later
time
it
is
a
fact
that
things
learned
a
long
time
before
they
are
to
be
recalled
fade
away
if
you
are
not
going
to
recall
material
until
a
long
time
after
the
impression
store
up
enough
impressions
so
that
you
can
afford
to
lose
a
few
and
still
retain
enough
until
time
for
recall
another
reason
for
overlearning
is
that
when
the
time
comes
for
recall
you
are
likely
to
be
disturbed
if
it
is
a
time
of
public
performance
you
may
be
embarrassed
or
you
may
be
hurried
or
under
distractions
accordingly
you
should
have
the
material
exceedingly
well
memorized
so
that
these
distractions
will
not
prove
detrimental
the
mere
statement
made
above
that
repetition
is
necessary
in
impression
is
not
sufficient
it
is
important
to
know
how
to
distribute
the
repetitions
suppose
you
are
memorizing
psalm
of
life
to
be
recited
a
month
from
and
that
you
require
thirty
repetitions
of
the
poem
to
learn
it
shall
you
make
these
thirty
repetitions
at
one
sitting
or
shall
you
distribute
them
among
several
sittings
in
general
it
is
better
to
spread
the
repetitions
over
a
period
of
time
the
question
then
arises
what
is
the
most
effective
distribution
various
combinations
are
possible
you
might
rehearse
the
poem
once
a
day
during
the
month
or
twice
a
day
for
the
first
fifteen
days
or
the
last
fifteen
days
four
times
every
fourth
day
in
the
face
of
these
possibilities
is
there
anything
that
will
guide
us
in
distributing
the
repetitions
we
shall
get
some
light
on
the
question
from
an
examination
of
the
curve
of
forgetting
a
curve
that
has
been
plotted
showing
the
rate
at
which
the
mind
tends
to
forget
forgetting
proceeds
according
to
law
the
curve
descending
rapidly
at
first
and
then
more
slowly
the
larger
proportion
of
the
material
learned
is
forgotten
the
first
day
or
so
after
that
a
constantly
decreasing
amount
is
forgotten
on
each
succeeding
day
for
perhaps
a
week
when
the
amount
remains
practically
stationary
this
gives
us
some
indication
that
the
early
repetitions
should
be
closer
together
than
those
at
the
end
of
the
period
so
long
as
you
are
forgetting
rapidly
you
will
need
more
repetitions
in
order
to
counterbalance
the
tendency
to
forget
you
might
well
make
five
repetitions
then
rest
in
about
an
hour
five
more
within
the
next
hours
five
more
by
this
time
you
should
have
the
poem
memorized
and
all
within
two
days
you
would
still
have
fifteen
repetitions
of
the
thirty
and
these
might
be
used
in
keeping
the
poem
fresh
in
the
mind
by
a
repetition
every
other
day
as
intimated
above
one
important
principle
in
memorizing
is
to
make
the
first
impressions
as
early
as
possible
for
older
impressions
have
many
chances
of
being
retained
this
is
evidenced
by
the
vividness
of
childhood
scenes
in
the
minds
of
our
grandparents
an
old
soldier
recalls
with
great
vividness
events
that
happened
during
the
civil
war
but
forgets
events
of
yesterday
there
is
involved
here
a
principle
of
nervous
action
that
you
have
already
encountered
namely
that
impressions
are
more
easily
made
and
retained
in
youth
it
should
also
be
observed
that
pathways
made
early
have
more
chances
of
being
used
than
those
made
recently
still
another
peculiarity
of
nervous
action
is
revealed
in
these
extended
periods
of
memorizing
it
has
been
discovered
that
if
a
rest
is
taken
between
impressions
the
impressions
become
more
firmly
fixed
this
points
to
the
presence
of
a
surprising
power
by
which
we
are
able
to
learn
as
it
were
while
we
sleep
we
shall
understand
this
better
if
we
try
to
imagine
what
is
happening
in
the
nervous
system
processes
of
nutrition
are
constantly
going
on
the
blood
brings
in
particles
to
repair
the
nerve
cells
rebuilding
them
according
to
the
pattern
left
by
the
last
impression
indeed
the
entrance
of
this
new
material
makes
the
impression
even
more
fixed
the
nutritional
processes
seem
to
set
the
impression
much
as
a
hypo
bath
fixes
or
sets
an
impression
on
a
photographic
plate
this
peculiarity
of
memory
led
professor
james
to
suggest
paradoxically
that
we
learn
to
skate
in
summer
and
to
swim
in
winter
and
indeed
one
usually
finds
in
beginning
the
skating
season
that
after
the
initial
stiffness
of
muscles
wears
off
one
glides
along
with
surprising
agility
you
see
then
that
if
you
plan
things
rightly
nature
will
do
much
of
your
learning
for
you
it
might
be
suggested
that
perhaps
things
impressed
just
before
going
to
sleep
have
a
better
chance
to
set
than
things
impressed
at
other
times
for
the
reason
that
sleep
is
the
time
when
the
reparative
processes
of
the
body
are
most
active
since
the
brain
pattern
requires
time
to
set
it
is
important
that
after
the
first
impression
you
refrain
from
introducing
anything
immediately
into
the
mind
that
might
disturb
it
after
you
have
impressed
the
poem
you
are
memorizing
do
not
immediately
follow
it
by
another
poem
let
the
brain
rest
for
three
or
four
minutes
until
after
the
first
impressions
have
had
a
chance
to
set
now
that
we
have
regarded
this
unconscious
memorizing
from
the
neurological
standpoint
let
us
consider
it
from
the
psychological
standpoint
how
are
the
ideas
being
modified
during
the
intervals
between
impressions
modern
psychology
has
discovered
that
much
memorizing
goes
on
without
our
knowing
it
paradoxical
as
that
may
seem
the
processes
may
be
described
in
terms
of
the
doctrine
of
association
which
is
that
whenever
two
things
have
once
been
associated
together
in
the
mind
there
is
a
tendency
thereafter
if
the
first
of
them
recurs
for
the
other
to
come
with
it
after
the
poem
of
our
illustration
has
once
been
repeated
there
is
a
tendency
for
events
in
everyday
experience
that
are
like
it
to
associate
themselves
with
it
for
example
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
week
many
things
might
arise
and
recall
to
you
the
line
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
and
it
would
become
by
that
fact
more
firmly
fixed
in
the
mind
this
valuable
recall
requires
that
you
must
make
the
first
impression
as
early
as
possible
before
the
time
for
ultimate
recall
this
persistence
of
ideas
in
the
mind
means
that
the
process
of
learning
does
not
cease
with
the
actual
work
of
learning
but
that
if
not
disturbed
this
process
runs
on
of
itself
for
a
time
and
adds
a
little
to
the
result
of
our
labors
it
also
means
that
if
it
is
to
our
advantage
to
stand
in
readiness
with
some
word
or
thought
we
shall
be
able
to
do
so
if
only
this
word
or
thought
recur
to
us
but
once
some
time
before
the
critical
moment
so
we
remember
to
keep
a
promise
to
pay
a
call
to
make
a
remark
at
the
proper
time
even
though
we
turn
our
mind
to
other
work
or
talk
for
some
hours
between
we
can
do
this
because
if
not
vigorously
prevented
ideas
and
words
keep
on
reappearing
in
the
mind
you
may
utilize
this
principle
in
to
good
advantage
as
soon
as
the
instructor
announces
the
subject
for
a
theme
begin
to
think
about
it
gather
together
all
the
ideas
you
have
about
the
subject
and
start
your
mind
to
work
upon
it
suppose
you
take
as
a
the
value
of
training
in
public
speaking
for
a
business
man
the
first
time
this
is
suggested
to
you
a
few
thoughts
at
least
will
come
to
you
write
them
down
even
though
they
are
disconnected
and
heterogeneous
then
as
you
go
about
your
other
work
you
will
find
a
number
of
occasions
that
will
arouse
ideas
bearing
upon
this
subject
you
may
read
in
a
newspaper
of
a
brilliant
speech
made
before
the
chamber
of
commerce
by
a
leading
business
man
which
will
serve
as
an
illustration
to
support
your
affirmative
position
or
you
may
attend
a
banquet
where
a
prominent
business
man
disappoints
his
audience
with
a
wretched
speech
such
experiences
and
many
others
bearing
more
or
less
directly
upon
the
subject
will
come
to
you
and
will
call
up
the
with
which
they
will
unite
themselves
write
down
these
ideas
as
they
occur
and
you
will
find
that
when
you
start
to
compose
the
theme
formally
it
almost
writes
itself
requiring
for
the
most
part
only
expansion
and
arrangement
of
ideas
while
thus
organizing
the
theme
you
will
reap
even
more
benefits
from
your
early
start
for
as
you
are
composing
it
you
will
find
new
ideas
crowding
in
upon
you
which
you
did
not
know
you
possessed
but
which
had
been
associating
themselves
in
your
mind
with
this
topic
even
when
you
were
unaware
of
the
fact
in
writing
themes
the
principle
of
distribution
of
time
may
also
be
profitably
employed
after
you
have
once
written
a
theme
lay
it
aside
for
a
while
perhaps
a
week
then
when
you
take
it
up
read
it
in
a
detached
manner
and
you
will
note
many
places
where
it
may
be
improved
these
benefits
are
to
be
enjoyed
only
when
a
theme
is
planned
a
long
time
ahead
hence
the
rule
to
start
as
early
as
possible
before
leaving
the
subject
of
which
was
called
up
by
the
discussion
of
unconscious
memory
another
suggestion
will
be
given
that
may
be
of
service
to
you
when
correcting
a
theme
employ
more
than
one
sense
avenue
do
not
simply
glance
over
it
with
your
eye
read
it
aloud
either
to
yourself
or
better
still
to
someone
else
when
you
do
this
you
will
be
amazed
to
discover
how
different
it
sounds
and
what
a
new
view
you
secure
of
it
when
you
thus
change
your
method
of
composition
you
will
find
a
new
group
of
ideas
thronging
into
your
mind
in
the
auditory
rendition
of
a
theme
you
will
discover
faults
of
syntax
which
escaped
you
in
silent
reading
you
will
note
duplication
of
words
split
infinitives
mixed
tenses
poorly
balanced
sentences
moreover
if
your
mind
has
certain
peculiarities
you
may
find
even
more
advantages
accruing
from
such
a
practice
the
author
for
example
has
a
slightly
different
set
of
ideas
at
his
disposal
according
to
the
medium
of
expression
employed
when
writing
with
a
pencil
one
set
of
ideas
comes
to
mind
with
a
typewriter
slightly
different
ideas
arise
when
talking
to
an
audience
still
different
ideas
three
sets
of
ideas
and
three
vocabularies
are
thus
available
for
use
on
any
subject
in
adopting
this
device
of
composing
through
several
mediums
you
should
combine
with
it
the
principle
of
distributing
time
already
discussed
in
connection
with
repetition
of
impressions
write
a
theme
one
day
then
lay
it
aside
for
a
few
days
and
go
back
to
it
with
a
fresh
mind
the
rests
will
be
found
very
beneficial
in
helping
you
to
get
a
new
viewpoint
of
the
subject
reverting
to
our
discussion
of
memory
we
come
upon
another
question
in
memorizing
material
like
the
poem
of
our
example
should
one
impress
the
entire
poem
at
once
or
break
it
up
into
parts
impressing
a
stanza
each
day
most
people
would
respond
without
thought
the
latter
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
most
memorizing
takes
place
in
this
way
experimental
psychology
however
has
discovered
that
this
is
uneconomical
the
selection
if
of
moderate
length
should
be
impressed
as
a
whole
if
too
long
for
this
it
should
be
broken
up
as
little
as
possible
in
order
to
see
the
necessity
for
this
let
us
examine
your
experiences
with
the
memorization
of
poems
in
your
early
school
days
you
probably
proceeded
as
follows
after
school
one
day
you
learned
the
first
stanza
then
went
out
to
play
the
next
day
you
learned
the
second
one
and
so
on
you
thought
at
the
end
of
a
week
that
you
had
memorized
it
because
at
the
end
of
each
day
sitting
you
were
able
to
recite
perfectly
the
stanza
learned
that
day
on
speaking
day
you
started
out
bravely
and
recited
the
first
stanza
without
mishap
when
you
started
to
think
of
the
second
one
however
it
would
not
come
the
memory
balked
now
what
was
the
matter
how
can
we
explain
this
distressing
blank
in
psychological
terms
we
ascribe
the
difficulty
to
the
failure
to
make
proper
associations
between
stanzas
association
was
made
effectively
between
the
lines
of
the
single
stanzas
but
not
between
the
separate
stanzas
after
you
finished
impressing
the
first
stanza
you
went
about
something
else
playing
ball
perhaps
when
you
approached
the
poem
the
next
day
you
started
in
with
the
second
stanza
there
was
then
no
bridge
between
the
two
there
was
nothing
to
link
the
last
line
of
the
first
stanza
and
things
are
not
what
they
seem
with
the
first
line
of
the
next
stanza
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
this
makes
clear
the
necessity
of
impressing
the
poem
as
a
whole
instead
of
by
parts
according
to
another
classification
there
are
two
ways
of
memorizing
by
rote
and
by
logical
associations
rote
memorizing
involves
the
repetition
of
material
just
as
it
stands
and
usually
requires
such
long
and
laborious
drill
that
it
is
seldom
economical
true
some
matter
must
be
memorized
this
way
such
as
the
days
of
the
week
and
the
names
of
the
months
but
there
is
another
and
gentler
method
which
is
usually
more
effective
and
economical
than
that
of
brutal
repetition
that
is
the
method
of
logical
association
by
which
one
links
up
a
new
fact
with
something
already
in
the
mind
if
for
example
you
wish
to
remember
the
date
of
the
world
fair
in
chicago
you
might
proceed
as
follows
ask
yourself
what
did
the
fair
commemorate
the
discovery
of
america
in
the
four
hundredth
anniversary
occurring
in
the
fair
could
not
be
made
ready
in
that
year
however
so
was
postponed
a
year
such
a
process
of
memorizing
the
date
is
less
laborious
than
the
method
of
rote
memory
and
is
usually
more
likely
to
lead
to
ready
recall
the
old
fact
already
in
mind
acts
as
a
magnet
which
at
some
later
time
may
call
up
other
facts
that
had
once
been
associated
with
it
you
can
easily
see
that
this
new
fact
might
have
been
associated
with
several
old
facts
thus
securing
more
chances
of
being
called
up
from
this
it
may
be
inferred
that
the
more
facts
you
have
in
your
mind
about
a
subject
the
more
chances
you
have
of
retaining
new
facts
it
is
sometimes
thought
that
if
a
person
stores
so
much
in
his
memory
it
will
soon
be
so
full
that
he
can
not
memorize
any
more
this
is
a
false
notion
involving
a
conception
of
the
brain
as
a
hopper
into
which
impressions
are
poured
until
it
runs
over
on
the
contrary
it
should
be
regarded
as
an
interlacing
of
fibers
with
infinite
possibilities
of
and
no
one
ever
exhausts
the
number
of
associations
that
can
be
made
the
method
of
logical
association
may
be
employed
with
telling
effect
in
the
study
of
foreign
languages
when
you
meet
a
new
word
scrutinize
it
carefully
for
some
trace
of
a
word
already
familiar
to
you
either
in
that
language
or
in
another
this
independent
discovery
of
meanings
is
a
very
great
aid
in
saving
time
and
in
fixing
the
meaning
of
new
words
opportunities
for
this
method
are
especially
frequent
in
the
german
language
since
so
many
german
words
are
formed
by
compounding
other
words
rathausmarkt
is
a
long
and
apparently
difficult
german
word
and
one
first
temptation
is
to
look
it
up
in
the
lexicon
and
promptly
forget
it
let
us
analyze
it
however
and
we
shall
see
that
it
is
only
a
compound
of
already
familiar
words
is
already
familiar
as
the
word
for
counsel
to
give
advice
is
equally
familiar
so
we
see
that
the
first
part
of
the
word
means
the
of
a
city
is
called
a
city
hall
is
equally
familiar
as
so
the
significance
of
the
entire
word
stands
by
such
a
method
of
utilizing
facts
already
known
you
may
make
yourself
much
more
independent
of
the
lexicon
and
may
make
your
memory
for
foreign
words
much
more
tenacious
we
approach
a
phase
of
impression
the
importance
of
which
is
often
unsuspected
namely
the
intention
with
which
memorizing
is
done
the
fidelity
of
memory
is
greatly
affected
by
the
intention
if
at
the
time
of
impression
you
intend
to
retain
only
until
the
time
of
recall
the
material
tends
to
slip
away
after
that
time
if
however
you
impress
with
the
intention
to
retain
permanently
the
material
stays
by
you
better
students
make
a
great
mistake
when
they
study
for
the
purpose
merely
of
retaining
until
after
examination
time
intend
to
retain
facts
permanently
and
there
will
be
greater
likelihood
of
their
permanence

second
aids
to
memory
retention
recall
and
recognition
our
discussion
up
to
this
point
has
centred
around
the
phase
of
memory
called
impression
we
have
described
some
of
the
conditions
favorable
to
impression
and
have
seen
that
certain
and
accurate
memory
depends
upon
adherence
to
them
the
next
phase
of
memory
retention
can
not
be
described
in
psychological
terms
we
know
we
retain
facts
after
they
are
once
impressed
but
as
to
their
status
in
the
mind
we
can
say
nothing
if
you
were
asked
when
the
declaration
of
independence
was
signed
you
would
reply
instantly
when
asked
however
where
that
fact
was
five
minutes
ago
you
could
not
answer
somewhere
in
the
recesses
of
the
mind
perhaps
but
as
to
immediate
awareness
of
it
there
was
none
we
may
try
to
think
of
retention
in
terms
of
nerve
cells
and
say
that
at
the
time
when
the
material
was
first
impressed
there
was
some
modification
made
in
certain
nerve
cells
which
persisted
this
trait
of
nerve
modifiability
is
one
factor
which
accounts
for
greater
retentive
power
in
some
persons
than
in
others
it
must
not
be
concluded
however
that
all
good
memory
is
due
to
the
inheritance
of
this
trait
it
is
due
partly
to
observance
of
proper
conditions
of
impression
and
much
can
be
done
to
overcome
or
offset
innate
difficulty
of
modification
by
such
observance
we
are
now
ready
to
examine
the
third
phase
of
memory
recall
this
is
the
stage
at
which
material
that
has
been
impressed
and
retained
is
recalled
to
serve
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
memorized
recall
is
thus
the
goal
of
memory
and
all
the
devices
so
far
discussed
have
it
for
their
object
can
we
facilitate
recall
by
any
other
means
than
by
faithful
and
intelligent
impressions
for
answer
let
us
examine
the
state
of
mind
at
time
of
recall
we
find
that
it
is
a
unique
mental
state
it
differs
from
impression
in
being
a
period
of
more
active
search
for
facts
in
the
mind
accompanied
by
expression
instead
of
a
concentration
upon
the
external
impression
it
is
also
usually
accompanied
by
motor
expressions
either
talking
or
writing
since
recall
is
a
unique
mental
state
you
ought
to
prepare
for
it
by
means
of
a
rehearsal
when
you
are
memorizing
anything
to
be
recalled
make
part
of
your
memorizing
a
rehearsal
of
it
if
possible
under
same
conditions
as
final
recall
in
memorizing
from
a
book
first
make
impression
then
close
the
book
and
practise
recall
when
memorizing
a
selection
to
be
given
in
a
public
speaking
class
intersperse
the
periods
of
impression
with
periods
of
recall
this
is
especially
necessary
in
preparation
for
public
speaking
for
facing
an
audience
gives
rise
to
a
vastly
different
psychic
attitude
from
that
of
impression
the
sight
of
an
audience
may
be
embarrassing
or
exciting
furthermore
unforeseen
distractions
may
arise
accordingly
create
those
conditions
as
nearly
as
possible
in
your
preparation
imagine
yourself
facing
the
audience
practise
aloud
so
that
you
will
become
accustomed
to
the
sound
of
your
own
voice
the
importance
of
the
practice
of
recall
as
a
part
of
the
memory
process
can
hardly
be
overestimated
one
psychologist
has
advised
that
in
memorizing
significant
material
more
than
half
the
time
should
be
spent
in
practising
recall
there
still
remains
a
fourth
phase
of
memory
recognition
whenever
a
remembered
fact
is
recalled
it
is
accompanied
by
a
characteristic
feeling
which
we
call
the
feeling
of
recognition
it
has
been
described
as
a
feeling
of
familiarity
a
glow
of
warmth
a
sense
of
ownership
a
feeling
of
intimacy
as
you
walk
down
the
street
of
a
great
city
you
pass
hundreds
of
faces
all
of
them
strange
suddenly
in
the
crowd
you
catch
sight
of
some
one
you
know
and
are
instantly
suffused
with
a
glow
of
feeling
that
is
markedly
different
from
your
feeling
toward
the
others
that
glow
represents
the
feeling
of
recognition
it
is
always
present
during
recall
and
may
be
used
in
great
advantage
in
studying
it
derives
its
virtue
for
our
purpose
from
the
fact
that
it
is
a
feeling
and
at
the
time
of
feeling
the
bodily
activities
in
general
are
affected
changes
occur
in
heart
beat
breathing
various
glandular
secretions
are
affected
the
digestive
organs
respond
in
this
general
quickening
of
bodily
activity
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
nervous
system
partakes
and
things
become
impressed
more
readily
thus
the
feeling
of
recognition
that
accompanies
recall
is
responsible
for
one
of
the
benefits
of
reviews
at
such
a
time
material
once
memorized
becomes
tinged
with
a
feelingful
color
different
from
that
which
accompanied
it
when
new
review
then
not
merely
to
produce
additional
impressions
but
also
to
take
advantage
of
the
feeling
of
recognition
we
have
now
discussed
memory
in
its
four
phases
and
have
seen
clearly
that
it
operates
not
in
a
blind
chaotic
manner
but
according
to
law
certain
conditions
are
required
and
when
they
are
met
memory
is
good
after
providing
proper
conditions
for
memory
then
trust
your
memory
an
attitude
of
confidence
is
very
necessary
if
when
you
are
memorizing
you
continually
tremble
for
fear
that
you
will
not
recall
at
the
desired
moment
the
fixedness
of
the
impression
will
be
greatly
hindered
therefore
after
utilizing
all
your
knowledge
about
the
conditions
of
memorizing
rest
content
and
trust
to
the
laws
of
nature
they
will
not
fail
you
by
this
time
you
have
seen
that
memory
is
not
a
mysterious
mental
faculty
with
which
some
people
are
generously
endowed
and
of
which
others
are
deprived
all
people
of
normal
intelligence
can
remember
and
can
improve
their
ability
if
they
desire
the
improvement
does
not
take
the
form
that
some
people
expect
however
no
magic
wand
can
transform
you
into
a
good
memorizes
you
must
work
the
transformation
yourself
furthermore
it
is
not
an
instantaneous
process
to
be
accomplished
overnight
it
will
come
about
only
after
you
have
built
up
a
set
of
habits
according
to
our
conception
of
study
as
a
process
of
habit
formation
a
final
word
of
caution
should
be
added
some
people
think
of
memory
as
a
separate
division
or
compartment
of
the
mind
which
can
be
controlled
and
improved
by
exercising
it
alone
such
a
conception
is
fallacious
improvement
in
memory
will
involve
improvement
in
other
mental
abilities
and
you
will
find
that
as
you
improve
your
ability
to
remember
you
will
develop
at
the
same
time
better
powers
to
concentrate
attention

image
to
associate
facts

concentration
of
attention
nearly
everyone
has
difficulty
in
the
concentration
of
attention
brain
workers
in
business
and
industry
students
in
high
school
and
college
and
even
professors
in
universities
complain
of
the
same
difficulty
attention
seems
in
some
way
to
be
at
the
very
core
of
mental
activity
for
no
matter
from
what
aspect
we
view
the
mind
its
excellence
seems
to
depend
upon
the
power
to
concentrate
attention
when
we
examine
a
growing
infant
one
of
the
first
signs
by
which
we
judge
the
awakening
of
intelligence
is
the
power
to
pay
attention
or
to
notice
things
when
we
examine
the
intellectual
ability
of
normal
adults
we
do
so
by
means
of
tests
that
require
close
concentration
of
attention
in
judging
the
intelligence
of
people
with
whom
we
associate
every
day
we
regard
one
who
is
able
to
maintain
close
attention
for
long
periods
of
time
as
a
person
of
strong
mind
we
rate
thomas
edison
as
a
powerful
thinker
when
we
read
that
he
becomes
so
absorbed
in
work
that
he
neither
eats
nor
sleeps
finally
when
we
examine
the
insane
and
the
we
find
that
one
form
which
their
derangements
take
is
an
inability
to
control
the
attention
this
evidence
added
to
our
own
experience
shows
us
the
importance
of
concentration
of
attention
in
study
and
we
become
even
more
desirous
of
investigating
attention
to
see
how
we
may
develop
it
we
shall
be
better
able
to
discuss
attention
if
we
select
for
analysis
a
concrete
situation
when
the
mind
is
in
a
state
of
concentrated
attention
concentrate
for
a
moment
upon
the
letter
o
although
you
are
ostensibly
focussing
all
your
powers
of
attention
upon
the
letter
nevertheless
you
are
really
aware
of
a
number
of
things
besides
of
other
words
on
the
page
of
other
objects
in
the
field
of
vision
of
sounds
in
the
room
and
on
the
street
of
sensations
from
your
clothing
and
of
sensations
from
your
bodily
organs
such
as
the
heart
and
lungs
in
addition
to
these
sensations
you
will
find
if
you
introspect
carefully
enough
that
your
mind
also
contains
a
number
of
ideas
and
imaginings
thoughts
about
the
paragraph
you
just
read
or
about
one
of
your
lessons
thus
we
see
that
at
a
time
when
we
apparently
focus
our
attention
upon
but
one
thing
we
really
have
a
large
number
of
things
in
our
mind
and
they
are
of
a
great
variety
the
mental
field
might
be
represented
by
a
circle
at
the
centre
of
which
is
the
object
of
attention
it
may
be
an
object
in
the
external
world
perceived
through
one
of
the
senses
or
it
may
be
an
idea
we
are
thinking
about
such
for
example
as
the
idea
of
infinity
but
whether
the
thing
attended
to
is
a
perception
or
an
idea
we
may
properly
speak
of
it
as
the
object
of
attention
or
the
focal
object
in
addition
to
this
we
must
recognize
the
presence
of
a
large
number
of
other
objects
both
sensory
and
ideational
these
are
nearer
the
margin
of
the
mental
field
so
we
call
them
marginal
the
distinctive
thing
about
a
state
of
mind
such
as
that
just
described
is
that
the
focal
object
is
much
clearer
than
the
marginal
objects
for
example
when
you
fixated
the
letter
o
it
was
only
in
the
vaguest
sort
of
fashion
that
you
were
aware
of
the
contact
of
your
clothing
or
the
lurking
ideas
of
other
lessons
as
we
examine
these
marginal
objects
further
we
find
that
they
are
continually
seeking
to
crowd
into
the
centre
of
attention
and
to
become
clear
you
may
be
helped
in
forming
a
vivid
picture
of
conditions
if
you
think
of
the
mind
as
a
stream
ever
in
motion
and
as
it
flows
on
the
objects
in
it
continually
shift
their
positions
a
of
the
stream
at
any
moment
may
show
the
contents
of
the
mind
arranged
in
a
particular
pattern
but
at
the
very
next
moment
they
may
be
arranged
in
a
different
pattern
another
object
occupying
the
focus
while
the
previous
tenant
is
pushed
to
the
margin
thus
we
see
that
it
is
a
tendency
of
the
mind
to
be
forever
changing
if
left
to
itself
it
would
be
in
ceaseless
fluctuation
the
whim
of
every
passing
fancy
this
tendency
to
fluctuate
comes
with
more
or
less
regularity
some
psychologists
say
every
second
or
two
true
we
do
not
always
yield
to
the
fluctuating
tendency
nevertheless
we
are
recurrently
tempted
and
we
must
exercise
continuous
effort
to
keep
a
particular
object
at
the
focus
the
power
to
exert
effort
and
to
regulate
the
arrangement
of
our
states
of
mind
is
the
peculiar
gift
of
man
and
is
a
prime
function
of
education
viewed
in
this
light
then
we
see
that
the
voluntary
focusing
of
our
attention
consists
in
the
selecting
of
certain
objects
to
be
attended
to
and
the
ignoring
of
other
objects
which
act
as
distractions
we
may
conveniently
classify
the
latter
as
external
sensations
bodily
sensations
and
irrelevant
ideas
let
us
take
an
actual
situation
that
may
arise
in
study
and
see
how
this
applies
suppose
you
are
in
your
room
studying
about
charlemagne
a
page
of
your
history
text
occupying
the
centre
of
your
attention
the
marginal
distractions
in
such
a
case
would
consist
first
in
external
sensations
such
as
the
glare
from
your
the
hissing
of
the
radiator
the
practising
of
a
neighboring
vocalist
the
rattle
of
passing
the
bodily
distractions
might
consist
of
sensations
of
weariness
referred
to
the
back
the
arms
and
the
eyes
and
fainter
sensations
from
the
digestive
organs
heart
and
lungs
the
irrelevant
ideas
might
consist
of
thoughts
about
a
german
lesson
which
you
are
going
to
study
visions
of
a
face
or
thoughts
about
some
social
engagement
these
marginal
objects
are
in
the
mind
even
when
you
conscientiously
focus
your
mind
upon
the
history
lesson
and
though
vague
they
try
to
force
their
way
into
the
focus
and
become
clear
the
task
of
paying
attention
then
consists
in
maintaining
the
desired
object
at
the
centre
of
the
mental
field
and
keeping
the
distractions
away
with
this
definition
of
attention
we
see
that
in
order
to
increase
the
effectiveness
of
attention
during
study
we
must
devise
means
for
overcoming
the
distractions
peculiar
to
study
obviously
the
first
thing
is
to
eliminate
every
distraction
possible
such
a
plan
of
elimination
may
require
a
radical
rearrangement
of
study
conditions
for
students
often
fail
to
realize
how
wretched
their
conditions
of
study
are
from
a
psychological
standpoint
they
attempt
to
study
in
rooms
with
two
or
three
others
who
talk
and
move
about
continually
they
drop
down
in
any
spot
in
the
library
and
expose
themselves
needlessly
to
a
great
number
of
distractions
if
you
wish
to
become
a
good
student
you
must
prepare
conditions
as
favorable
as
possible
for
study
choose
a
quiet
room
to
live
in
free
from
distracting
sounds
and
sights
have
your
room
at
a
temperature
neither
too
hot
nor
too
cold
is
usually
considered
favorable
for
study
when
reading
in
the
library
sit
down
in
a
quiet
spot
with
your
back
to
the
door
so
you
will
not
be
tempted
to
look
up
as
people
enter
the
room
do
not
sit
near
a
group
of
gossipers
or
near
a
creaking
door
having
made
the
external
conditions
favorable
for
study
you
should
next
address
yourself
to
the
task
of
eliminating
bodily
distractions
the
most
disturbing
of
these
in
study
are
sensations
of
fatigue
for
contrary
to
the
opinion
of
many
people
study
is
very
fatiguing
work
and
involves
continual
strain
upon
the
muscles
in
holding
the
body
still
particularly
those
of
the
back
neck
arms
hands
and
above
all
the
eyes
how
many
movements
are
made
by
your
eyes
in
the
course
of
an
hour
study
they
sweep
back
and
forth
across
the
page
incessantly
being
moved
by
six
muscles
which
are
bound
to
become
fatigued
still
more
fatigue
comes
from
the
contractions
of
delicate
muscles
within
the
eyeball
where
adjustments
are
made
for
far
and
near
vision
and
for
varying
amounts
of
light
the
eyes
then
give
rise
to
much
fatigue
and
altogether
are
the
source
of
a
great
many
bodily
distractions
in
study
other
distractions
may
consist
of
sensations
from
the
clothing
we
are
always
vaguely
aware
of
pressure
of
our
clothing
usually
it
is
not
sufficiently
noticeable
to
cause
much
annoyance
but
occasionally
it
is
as
is
demonstrated
at
night
when
we
take
off
a
shoe
with
such
a
sigh
of
relief
that
we
realize
in
retrospect
it
had
been
vaguely
troubling
us
all
day
in
trying
to
create
conditions
for
efficient
study
many
bodily
distractions
can
be
eliminated
the
study
chair
should
be
easy
to
sit
in
so
as
to
reduce
fatigue
of
the
muscles
supporting
the
body
the
should
be
arranged
so
as
to
require
little
effort
to
hold
the
book
the
light
should
come
over
the
left
shoulder
this
is
especially
necessary
in
writing
so
that
the
writing
hand
will
not
cast
a
shadow
upon
the
work
the
muscles
of
the
eyes
will
be
rested
and
fatigue
will
be
retarded
if
you
close
the
eyes
occasionally
then
in
order
to
lessen
the
general
fatigue
of
the
body
you
may
find
it
advantageous
to
rise
and
walk
about
occasionally
lastly
the
clothing
should
be
loose
and
unconfining
especially
should
there
be
plenty
of
room
for
circulation
in
the
overcoming
of
distractions
we
have
seen
that
much
may
be
done
by
way
of
eliminating
distractions
and
we
have
pointed
out
the
way
to
accomplish
this
to
a
certain
extent
but
in
spite
of
our
most
careful
provisions
there
will
still
be
distractions
that
can
not
be
eliminated
you
can
not
for
example
chloroform
the
vocalist
in
the
neighboring
apartment
nor
stop
the
while
you
study
you
can
not
rule
out
fatigue
sensations
entirely
and
you
can
not
build
a
fence
around
the
focus
of
your
mind
so
as
to
keep
out
unwelcome
and
irrelevant
ideas
the
only
thing
to
do
then
is
to
accept
as
inevitable
the
presence
of
some
distractions
and
to
realise
that
to
pay
attention
it
is
necessary
to
habituate
yourself
to
the
ignoring
of
distractions
in
the
accomplishment
of
this
end
it
will
be
necessary
to
apply
the
principles
of
habit
formation
already
described
start
out
by
making
a
strong
determination
to
ignore
all
distractions
practise
ignoring
them
and
do
not
let
a
slip
occur
try
to
develop
interest
in
the
object
of
attention
because
we
pay
attention
to
those
things
in
which
we
are
most
interested
a
final
point
that
may
help
you
is
to
use
the
first
lapse
of
attention
as
a
reminder
of
the
object
you
desire
to
fixate
upon
this
may
be
illustrated
by
the
following
example
suppose
in
studying
a
history
lesson
you
come
upon
a
reference
to
the
royal
apparel
of
charlemagne
the
word
royal
might
call
up
purple
a
northwestern
university
pennant
the
person
who
gave
it
to
you
and
before
you
know
it
you
are
off
in
a
long
leading
far
from
the
history
lesson
such
migrations
as
these
are
very
likely
to
occur
in
study
and
constitute
one
of
the
most
treacherous
pitfalls
of
student
life
in
trying
to
avoid
them
you
must
form
habits
of
disregarding
irrelevant
ideas
when
they
try
to
obtrude
themselves
and
the
way
to
do
this
is
to
school
yourself
so
that
the
first
lapse
of
attention
will
remind
you
of
the
lesson
in
hand
it
can
be
done
if
you
keep
yourself
sensitive
to
wanderings
of
attention
and
let
the
first
slip
from
the
topic
with
which
you
are
engaged
remind
you
to
pull
yourself
back
do
this
before
you
have
taken
the
step
that
will
carry
you
far
away
for
with
each
step
in
the
series
of
associations
it
becomes
harder
to
draw
yourself
back
into
the
correct
channel
in
reading
one
frequent
cause
for
lapses
of
attention
and
for
the
intrusion
of
unwelcome
ideas
is
obscurity
in
the
material
being
read
if
you
trace
back
your
lapses
of
attention
you
will
often
find
that
they
first
occur
when
the
thought
becomes
difficult
to
follow
the
sentence
ambiguous
or
a
single
word
unusual
as
a
result
the
meaning
grows
hazy
in
your
mind
and
you
fail
to
comprehend
it
naturally
then
you
drift
into
a
channel
of
thought
that
is
easier
to
follow
this
happens
because
the
mental
stream
tends
to
seek
channels
of
least
resistance
if
you
introspect
carefully
you
will
undoubtedly
discover
that
many
of
your
annoying
lapses
of
attention
can
be
traced
to
such
conditions
the
obvious
remedy
is
to
make
sure
that
you
understand
everything
as
you
read
as
soon
as
you
feel
the
thought
growing
difficult
to
follow
begin
to
exert
more
effort
consult
the
dictionary
for
the
meanings
of
words
you
do
not
understand
probably
the
ordinary
freshman
in
college
ought
to
look
up
the
meaning
of
as
many
as
twenty
words
daily
again
the
thought
may
be
difficult
to
follow
because
your
previous
knowledge
is
deficient
perhaps
the
discussion
involves
some
fact
which
you
never
did
comprehend
clearly
and
you
will
naturally
fail
to
understand
something
built
upon
it
if
deficiency
of
knowledge
is
the
cause
of
your
lapses
of
attention
the
obvious
remedy
is
to
turn
back
and
study
the
fundamental
facts
to
lay
a
firm
foundation
in
your
subjects
of
study
this
discussion
shows
that
the
conditions
at
time
of
concentrated
attention
are
very
complex
that
the
mind
is
full
of
a
number
of
things
that
your
object
as
a
student
is
to
keep
some
one
thing
at
the
focus
of
your
mind
and
that
in
doing
so
you
must
continuously
ignore
other
mental
contents
in
our
psychological
descriptions
we
have
implied
that
the
mind
stands
still
at
times
permitting
us
to
take
a
and
examine
it
minutely
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
mind
never
stands
still
it
continually
moves
along
and
at
no
two
moments
is
it
exactly
the
same
this
results
in
a
condition
whereby
an
idea
which
is
at
one
moment
at
the
centre
can
not
remain
there
unless
it
takes
on
a
slightly
different
appearance
from
moment
to
moment
when
you
attempted
to
fix
your
attention
upon
the
letter
o
you
found
a
constant
tendency
to
shift
the
attention
perhaps
to
a
variation
in
the
intensity
of
the
type
or
to
a
flaw
in
the
type
or
in
the
paper
in
view
of
the
inevitable
nature
of
these
changes
you
see
that
in
spite
of
your
best
efforts
you
can
not
expect
to
maintain
any
object
of
study
inflexibly
at
the
centre
of
attention
the
way
to
do
is
to
manipulate
the
object
so
that
it
will
appear
from
moment
to
moment
in
a
slightly
different
light
if
for
example
you
are
trying
to
concentrate
upon
a
rule
of
english
grammar
long
enough
to
memorize
it
do
not
read
it
over
and
over
again
depending
solely
upon
repetition
a
better
way
after
thoroughly
comprehending
it
is
to
think
about
it
in
several
relations
compare
it
with
other
rules
noting
points
of
likeness
and
difference
apply
it
to
the
construction
of
a
sentence
the
essential
thing
is
to
do
something
with
it
only
thus
can
you
keep
it
in
the
focus
of
attention
this
is
equivalent
to
the
restatement
of
another
fact
stressed
in
a
previous
chapter
namely
that
the
mind
is
not
a
passive
thing
that
stands
still
but
an
active
thing
when
you
give
attention
you
actively
select
from
a
number
of
possible
objects
one
to
be
clearer
than
the
rest
this
selection
requires
effort
under
most
conditions
of
study
but
you
may
be
cheered
by
the
thought
that
as
you
develop
interest
in
the
fields
of
study
and
as
you
develop
habits
of
ignoring
distractions
you
will
be
able
to
fixate
your
attention
with
less
and
less
effort
a
further
important
fact
is
that
as
you
develop
power
to
select
objects
for
the
consideration
of
attention
you
develop
simultaneously
other
mental
processes
the
ability
to
memorize
to
economize
time
and
effort
and
to
control
future
thoughts
and
actions

short

chapter
ix
how
we
reason
if
you
were
asked
to
describe
the
most
embarrassing
of
your
experiences
you
would
probably
cite
the
occasions
when
the
instructor
asks
you
a
series
of
questions
demanding
close
reasoning
as
he
pins
you
down
to
statement
of
facts
and
forces
you
to
draw
valid
conclusions
you
feel
in
a
most
perplexed
frame
of
mind
either
you
find
yourself
unable
to
give
reasons
or
you
entangle
yourself
in
contradictions
in
short
you
flounder
about
helplessly
and
feel
as
though
the
bottom
of
your
ship
of
knowledge
has
dropped
out
and
when
the
ordeal
is
over
and
you
have
made
a
miserable
botch
of
a
recitation
which
you
thought
you
had
been
perfectly
prepared
for
you
complain
that
if
the
instructor
had
followed
the
book
or
if
he
had
asked
straight
questions
you
would
have
answered
every
one
perfectly
having
memorized
the
lesson
word
for
word
this
complaint
so
often
voiced
by
students
reveals
the
fundamental
characteristic
which
distinguishes
the
mental
operation
of
reasoning
from
the
others
we
have
studied
in
reasoning
we
face
a
new
kind
of
situation
presenting
difficulties
not
encountered
in
the
simpler
processes
of
sensation
memory
and
imagery
and
when
we
attempt
to
substitute
these
simple
processes
for
reasoning
we
fail
miserably
for
the
two
kinds
of
processes
are
essentially
different
and
can
not
be
substituted
one
for
the
other
broadly
speaking
the
mental
activities
of
study
may
be
divided
into
two
groups
which
for
want
of
better
names
we
shall
call
processes
of
acquisition
and
processes
of
construction
the
mental
attitude
of
the
first
is
that
of
acquirement
sometimes
our
main
business
seems
to
be
to
acquire
knowledge
certain
matters
are
placed
before
us
in
books
or
by
our
teachers
and
we
are
required
to
master
them
to
make
them
part
of
our
stock
of
knowledge
at
other
times
we
are
called
upon
to
use
the
knowledge
we
already
possess
in
order
to
attain
some
end
that
is
set
before
us
in
geography
for
example
so
long
as
we
are
merely
learning
the
bare
facts
of
the
subject
the
size
and
contours
of
the
different
continents
the
political
divisions
the
natural
features
we
are
at
the
acquisitive
stage
but
when
we
go
on
to
try
to
find
out
the
reasons
why
certain
facts
that
we
have
learned
should
be
as
they
are
and
not
otherwise
we
pass
to
the
constructive
stage
we
are
working
constructively
when
we
seek
to
discover
why
it
is
that
great
cities
are
so
often
found
on
the
banks
of
rivers
why
peninsulas
more
frequently
turn
southward
than
northward
you
readily
see
that
this
constructive
method
of
study
involves
the
setting
and
solving
of
problems
as
its
distinguishing
feature
and
that
in
the
solution
of
these
problems
we
make
use
of
reason
a
little
reflection
will
show
that
though
there
is
a
distinct
difference
between
processes
of
acquisition
and
of
construction
nevertheless
the
two
must
not
be
regarded
as
entirely
separate
from
each
other
in
acquiring
new
facts
we
must
always
use
a
little
reason
while
in
constructive
work
we
can
not
always
rely
upon
having
all
the
necessary
matter
ready
to
hand
we
have
frequently
to
stop
our
constructive
work
for
a
little
in
order
to
acquire
some
new
facts
that
we
find
to
be
necessary
thus
we
acquire
a
certain
number
of
new
facts
while
we
are
reasoning
about
things
and
while
we
are
engaged
in
acquiring
new
matter
we
must
use
our
reason
at
least
to
some
small
extent
the
two
overlap
then
but
there
is
a
difference
between
them
from
the
standpoint
of
the
student
and
the
terms
denote
two
fundamentally
different
attitudes
which
students
take
in
study
the
two
attitudes
may
be
illustrated
by
contrasting
the
two
methods
often
used
in
studying
geometry
some
students
memorize
the
theorem
and
the
steps
in
the
demonstration
reciting
them
verbatim
at
others
do
not
memorize
but
reason
out
each
step
to
see
its
relation
to
the
preceding
step
and
when
they
see
it
must
necessarily
follow
they
pass
on
to
the
next
and
do
the
same
these
two
types
of
students
apparently
arrive
at
the
same
conclusions
but
the
mental
operations
leading
up
to
the
of
each
are
vastly
different
the
one
student
does
his
studying
by
the
rote
memory
method
the
other
by
the
road
of
reasoning
the
former
road
is
usually
considered
the
easier
and
so
we
find
it
most
frequently
followed
to
memorize
a
table
a
definition
or
a
series
of
dates
is
relatively
easy
one
knows
exactly
where
one
is
and
can
keep
track
of
one
progress
and
test
one
success
some
people
are
attracted
by
such
a
task
and
are
perfectly
happy
to
follow
this
plan
of
study
the
kind
of
mind
that
contents
itself
with
such
phonographic
records
however
must
be
acknowledged
to
be
a
commonplace
sort
of
affair
we
recognize
its
limitations
in
ordinary
life
invariably
rating
it
lower
than
the
mind
that
can
reason
to
new
conclusions
and
work
independently
accordingly
if
we
wish
to
possess
minds
of
superior
quality
we
see
that
we
must
develop
the
reasoning
processes
when
we
examine
the
mental
processes
by
which
we
think
constructively
or
in
other
words
reason
we
find
first
of
all
that
there
is
recognition
of
a
problem
to
be
solved
when
we
start
to
reason
we
do
it
because
we
find
ourselves
in
a
situation
from
which
we
must
extricate
ourselves
the
situation
may
be
physical
as
when
our
automobile
stops
suddenly
on
a
country
road
or
it
may
be
mental
as
when
we
are
deciding
what
college
to
attend
in
both
cases
we
recognize
that
we
are
facing
a
problem
which
must
be
solved
after
recognition
of
the
problem
our
next
step
is
to
start
vigorous
efforts
to
solve
it
in
doing
this
we
cast
about
for
means
we
summon
all
the
powers
at
our
disposal
in
the
case
of
the
automobile
we
call
to
mind
other
accidents
and
the
causes
of
them
we
remember
that
once
the
played
out
so
we
test
this
hypothesis
at
another
time
some
dust
got
into
the
carburetor
so
we
test
this
so
we
go
on
calling
up
possible
causes
and
applying
appropriate
remedies
until
the
right
one
is
found
and
the
engine
is
started
in
bringing
to
bear
upon
the
problem
facts
from
our
past
experience
we
form
a
series
of
judgments
in
the
case
of
the
problem
as
to
what
college
to
attend
we
might
form
these
judgments
this
college
is
nearer
home
that
one
has
a
celebrated
faculty
this
one
has
good
laboratories
that
one
is
my
father
alma
mater
so
we
might
go
on
bringing
up
all
the
facts
regarding
the
problem
and
fitting
each
one
mentally
to
see
how
it
works
note
that
this
utilization
of
ideas
should
not
consist
merely
of
fumbling
about
in
a
vague
hope
of
hitting
upon
some
solution
it
must
be
a
systematic
search
guided
by
carefully
chosen
ideas
for
example
if
the
clock
on
the
has
stopped
and
we
have
no
idea
how
to
make
it
go
again
but
mildly
shake
it
in
the
hope
that
something
will
happen
to
set
it
going
we
are
merely
fumbling
but
if
on
moving
the
clock
gently
so
as
to
set
the
pendulum
in
motion
we
hear
it
wobbling
about
irregularly
and
at
the
same
time
observe
that
there
is
no
ticking
of
any
kind
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
pendulum
has
somehow
or
other
escaped
the
little
catch
that
connects
it
with
the
mechanism
we
have
been
really
thinking
from
the
fact
that
the
pendulum
wobbles
irregularly
we
infer
that
it
has
lost
its
proper
catch
from
the
fact
that
there
is
no
ticking
we
infer
the
same
thing
for
even
when
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
clock
that
will
prevent
it
from
going
permanently
if
the
pendulum
is
set
in
motion
by
force
from
without
it
will
tick
for
a
few
seconds
before
it
comes
to
rest
again
the
important
point
to
observe
is
that
there
must
be
inference
this
is
always
indicated
by
the
word
or
its
equivalent
if
you
reach
a
conclusion
without
having
to
use
or
at
any
rate
to
imply
a
you
may
take
it
for
granted
that
you
have
not
been
really
thinking
but
only
jumping
to
conclusions
this
process
of
putting
facts
in
the
form
of
judgments
and
drawing
inferences
may
be
likened
to
a
scene
where
arguments
are
presented
to
the
judge
as
each
bit
of
evidence
is
submitted
it
is
subjected
to
the
test
of
its
applicability
to
the
situation
or
to
similar
situations
in
the
past
it
is
rigidly
examined
and
nothing
is
accepted
as
a
candidate
for
the
solution
until
it
is
found
by
trial
of
course
in
imagination
to
be
pertinent
to
the
situation
the
third
stage
of
the
reasoning
process
comes
when
some
plan
which
has
been
suggested
as
a
possible
solution
of
the
difficulty
proves
effective
and
we
make
the
decision
the
arguments
support
or
overthrow
each
other
adding
to
and
eliminating
various
considerations
until
finally
only
one
course
appears
possible
as
we
said
before
the
solution
comes
inevitably
as
represented
by
the
word
little
active
work
on
our
part
is
necessary
for
if
we
have
gone
through
these
other
phases
properly
the
decision
will
make
itself
you
can
not
make
a
wrong
decision
if
you
have
the
facts
before
you
and
have
given
each
the
proper
weight
when
the
solution
comes
it
is
recognized
as
right
for
it
comes
tinged
with
a
feeling
that
we
call
belief
now
that
we
have
found
the
reasoning
process
to
be
one
of
of
which
the
first
step
is
to
acknowledge
and
recognize
the
difficulty
the
second
to
call
up
various
methods
of
solution
and
the
third
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
one
of
the
solutions
that
comes
tinged
with
certainty
we
are
ready
to
apply
this
schema
to
study
in
the
hope
that
we
may
discover
the
causes
and
remedies
for
the
reasoning
difficulties
of
students
in
view
of
the
fact
that
reasoning
starts
out
with
a
problem
you
see
at
once
that
to
make
your
study
effective
you
must
study
in
problems
avoid
an
habitual
attitude
of
mere
acquisition
do
not
memorize
facts
in
the
same
pattern
as
they
are
handed
out
to
you
in
history
in
general
literature
in
science
do
not
read
facts
merely
as
they
come
in
the
text
but
seek
the
relations
between
them
voluntarily
set
before
yourself
intellectual
problems
ask
yourself
is
this
so
in
other
words
in
your
study
do
not
merely
acquire
but
also
the
former
makes
use
mostly
of
memory
and
though
your
memorizing
be
done
ever
so
conscientiously
if
it
comprise
the
main
part
of
your
study
you
fail
to
utilize
your
mind
to
its
fullest
extent
let
us
now
consider
the
second
stage
of
the
reasoning
process
as
found
in
study
at
this
stage
the
facts
in
the
mind
are
brought
forward
for
the
purpose
of
being
fitted
into
the
present
situation
and
the
essential
thing
is
that
you
have
a
large
number
of
facts
at
your
disposal
if
you
are
going
to
reason
effectively
about
problems
in
history
mathematics
geography
it
is
absolutely
indispensable
that
you
know
many
facts
about
the
subjects
one
reason
why
you
experience
difficulty
in
reasoning
about
certain
subjects
is
that
you
do
not
know
enough
about
them
particularly
is
this
true
in
such
subjects
as
political
economy
sociology
and
psychology
the
results
of
such
ignorance
are
often
demonstrated
in
political
and
social
movements
why
do
the
masses
so
easily
fall
victims
to
doubtful
reforms
in
national
and
municipal
policies
because
they
do
not
know
enough
about
these
matters
to
reason
intelligently
watch
ignorant
people
listening
to
a
demagogue
and
see
what
unreasonable
things
they
accept
the
speaker
propounds
a
question
and
then
proceeds
to
answer
it
in
his
own
way
he
makes
it
appear
plausible
assuring
his
hearers
it
is
the
only
way
and
they
agree
because
they
do
not
have
enough
other
facts
at
their
command
to
refute
it
they
are
unable
as
we
say
to
see
the
situation
in
several
aspects
the
mistakes
in
reasoning
which
children
make
have
a
similar
basis
the
child
reaches
for
the
moon
reasoning
here
is
something
bright
i
can
touch
most
bright
things
therefore
i
can
touch
this
his
reasoning
is
fallacious
because
he
does
not
have
all
the
facts
this
condition
is
paralleled
in
the
when
students
make
what
are
shamefacedly
looked
back
upon
as
miserable
blunders
when
one
of
these
fiascos
occurs
the
cause
can
many
times
be
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
student
did
not
have
enough
facts
at
his
command
speaking
broadly
the
most
effective
reasoning
in
a
field
can
be
done
by
one
who
has
had
the
most
extensive
experiences
in
that
field
if
one
had
complete
acquaintance
with
all
facts
one
would
have
perfect
conditions
for
reasoning
thus
we
see
that
effectiveness
in
reasoning
demands
an
extensive
array
of
facts
accordingly
in
your
courses
of
study
you
must
read
with
avidity
when
you
are
given
a
list
of
readings
in
a
course
some
of
which
are
required
and
some
optional
read
both
sets
and
every
new
fact
thus
secured
will
make
you
better
able
to
reason
in
the
field
but
good
reasoning
demands
more
than
mere
quantity
of
ideas
the
ideas
must
conform
to
certain
qualitative
standards
before
they
may
be
effectively
employed
in
reasoning
they
must
arise
with
promptness
in
an
orderly
manner
pertinent
to
the
matter
in
hand
and
they
must
be
clear
in
securing
promptness
of
association
on
the
part
of
your
ideas
employ
the
methods
described
in
the
chapter
on
memory
make
many
logical
associations
with
clearness
and
repetition
in
order
to
insure
the
rise
of
ideas
in
an
orderly
manner
pay
attention
to
the
manner
in
which
you
acquire
them
remember
things
will
be
recalled
as
they
were
impressed
so
the
value
of
your
ideas
in
reasoning
will
depend
upon
the
manner
in
which
you
make
original
impressions
a
further
characteristic
of
serviceable
ideas
is
clarity
ideas
are
sometimes
described
as
clear
in
opposition
to
muddy
you
know
what
is
meant
by
these
distinctions
and
you
may
be
assured
that
one
cause
for
your
failures
in
reasoning
is
that
your
ideas
are
not
clear
this
manifests
itself
in
inability
to
make
clear
statements
and
to
comprehend
clearly
the
latter
condition
is
easily
illustrated
when
you
began
the
study
of
geometry
you
faced
a
multitude
of
new
terms
we
call
them
technical
terms
such
as
projection
scalene
theory
of
limits
these
had
to
be
clearly
understood
before
you
could
reason
in
the
subject
and
when
in
the
progress
of
your
study
you
experienced
difficulty
in
reasoning
out
problems
it
was
very
likely
due
to
the
fact
that
you
did
not
master
the
technical
terms
and
as
soon
as
you
encountered
the
difficulties
of
the
course
you
failed
because
your
foundation
laying
did
not
involve
the
acquisition
of
clear
ideas
examine
your
difficulties
in
reasoning
subjects
and
if
you
find
them
traceable
to
vagueness
of
ideas
take
steps
to
clarify
them
ideas
may
be
clarified
in
two
ways
by
definition
and
by
classification
definition
is
a
familiar
device
for
you
have
had
much
to
do
with
it
in
learning
the
memorization
of
definitions
is
an
excellent
practice
not
as
an
end
in
itself
but
as
a
means
to
the
end
of
effective
reasoning
throughout
your
study
then
pay
much
attention
to
definitions
some
you
will
find
in
your
texts
but
others
you
will
have
to
make
for
yourself
in
order
to
get
practice
in
this
undertake
the
manufacture
of
a
few
definitions
using
terms
such
as
charity
benevolence
natural
selection
this
exercise
will
reveal
what
an
exacting
mental
operation
definition
is
and
will
prove
how
vague
most
of
your
thinking
really
is
a
large
stock
of
definitions
will
help
you
to
think
rapidly
standing
as
they
do
for
a
large
group
of
experiences
definitions
are
a
means
of
mental
economy
for
illustration
of
their
service
in
reasoning
suppose
you
were
asked
to
compare
the
serf
the
peon
and
the
american
slave
if
you
have
a
definition
of
each
of
these
terms
you
can
readily
differentiate
between
them
but
if
you
can
not
define
them
you
will
hardly
be
able
to
reason
concerning
them
the
second
means
of
clarifying
ideas
is
classification
by
this
is
meant
the
process
of
grouping
similar
ideas
or
similar
points
of
ideas
for
example
your
ideas
of
serf
peon
and
slave
have
some
points
in
common
group
the
ideas
then
with
reference
to
these
points
then
in
reasoning
you
can
quickly
place
an
idea
in
its
proper
group
the
third
stage
of
the
reasoning
process
is
decision
based
on
belief
and
it
comes
inevitably
provided
the
other
two
processes
have
been
performed
rightly
accordingly
we
need
say
little
about
its
place
in
study
one
caution
should
be
pointed
out
in
making
decisions
do
not
make
them
hastily
on
the
basis
of
only
one
or
two
facts
wait
until
you
have
canvassed
all
the
ideas
that
bear
importantly
upon
the
case
the
masses
that
listen
top
eagerly
to
the
demagogue
do
not
err
merely
from
lack
of
ideas
but
partly
because
they
do
not
utilize
all
the
facts
at
their
disposal
this
fault
is
frequently
discernible
in
impulsive
people
who
notoriously
make
which
means
that
they
decide
before
canvassing
all
the
evidence
this
trait
marks
the
fundamental
difference
between
superficial
and
profound
thinkers
the
former
accept
surface
facts
and
decide
immediately
while
the
latter
refuse
to
decide
until
after
canvassing
many
facts
in
the
improvement
of
reasoning
ability
your
task
is
mainly
one
of
habit
formation
it
is
necessary
first
to
form
the
habit
of
stating
things
in
the
form
of
problems
second
to
form
habits
by
which
ideas
arise
promptly
and
profusely
third
to
form
habits
of
reserving
decisions
until
the
important
facts
are
in
these
are
all
specific
habits
that
must
be
built
up
if
the
reasoning
processes
of
the
mind
are
to
be
effective
already
you
have
formed
some
habits
if
not
habits
of
careful
looking
into
things
then
habits
of
hasty
heedless
impatient
glancing
over
the
surface
apply
the
principles
of
habit
formation
already
enunciated
and
remember
that
with
every
act
of
reasoning
you
perform
you
are
moulding
yourself
into
a
careless
reasoner
or
an
accurate
reasoner
into
a
clear
thinker
or
a
muddy
thinker
this
chapter
shows
that
reasoning
is
one
of
the
highest
powers
of
man
it
is
a
mark
of
originality
and
intelligence
and
stamps
its
possessor
not
a
copier
but
an
originator
not
a
follower
but
a
leader
not
a
slave
to
have
his
thinking
foisted
upon
him
by
others
but
a
free
and
independent
intellect
unshackled
by
the
bonds
of
ignorance
and
convention
the
man
who
employs
reason
in
acquiring
knowledge
finds
delights
in
study
that
are
denied
to
a
rote
memorizer
when
one
looks
at

expression
as
an
aid
in
study
in
our
discussion
of
the
nervous
basis
underlying
study
we
observed
that
nerve
pathways
are
affected
not
only
by
what
enters
over
the
sensory
pathways
but
also
by
what
flows
out
over
the
motor
pathways
as
the
nerve
currents
travel
out
from
the
motor
centres
in
the
brain
to
the
muscles
they
leave
traces
which
modify
future
thoughts
and
actions
this
being
so
it
is
easy
to
see
that
what
we
give
out
is
fully
as
important
as
what
we
take
in
in
other
words
our
are
just
as
important
as
our
by
expressions
we
mean
the
motor
consequences
of
our
thoughts
and
in
study
they
usually
take
the
form
of
speech
and
writing
of
a
kind
to
be
specified
later
the
effects
of
motor
expressions
are
too
infrequently
emphasized
but
psychology
forces
us
to
give
them
prime
consideration
we
are
first
apprised
of
their
importance
when
we
study
the
nervous
system
and
find
that
every
incoming
sensory
message
pushes
on
and
on
until
it
finds
a
motor
pathway
over
which
it
may
travel
and
produce
movement
this
is
inevitable
the
very
structure
and
arrangement
of
the
neurones
is
such
that
we
are
obliged
to
make
some
movement
in
response
to
objects
affecting
our
sense
organs
the
extent
of
movement
may
vary
from
the
tremors
that
occur
when
we
are
frightened
by
a
thunderstorm
to
the
merest
flicker
of
an
but
whatever
be
its
extent
movement
invariably
occurs
when
we
are
stimulated
by
some
object
this
has
been
demonstrated
in
startling
ways
in
the
psychological
laboratory
where
even
so
simple
a
thing
as
a
piece
of
figured
has
been
shown
to
produce
measurable
bodily
disturbances
ordinarily
we
do
not
notice
these
because
they
are
so
slight
sometimes
being
merely
twitches
of
muscles
or
slight
enlargements
or
contractions
of
arteries
which
are
very
responsive
to
nerve
currents
but
no
matter
how
large
or
how
small
we
may
be
sure
that
movements
always
occur
on
the
excitation
of
a
sense
organ
this
led
us
to
assert
in
an
earlier
chapter
that
the
function
of
the
nervous
system
is
to
convert
incoming
sensory
currents
into
outgoing
motor
currents
so
ingrained
is
this
tendency
toward
movement
that
we
do
not
need
even
a
sensory
cue
to
start
it
off
an
idea
will
do
as
well
in
other
words
the
nervous
current
need
not
start
at
a
sense
organ
but
may
start
in
the
brain
and
still
produce
movement
this
fact
is
embodied
in
the
law
of
action
distinguished
from
action
every
idea
in
the
mind
tends
to
express
itself
in
movement
this
motor
character
of
ideas
is
manifested
in
a
most
way
and
renders
our
muscular
system
a
faithful
mirror
of
our
thoughts
we
have
in
the
psychological
laboratory
delicate
apparatus
which
enables
us
to
measure
many
of
these
slight
movements
for
example
we
fasten
a
recording
device
to
the
top
of
a
person
head
so
that
his
slightest
movements
will
be
recorded
then
we
ask
him
while
standing
perfectly
still
to
think
of
an
object
at
his
right
side
after
several
moments
the
record
shows
that
he
involuntarily
leans
in
the
direction
of
the
object
about
which
he
is
thinking
we
find
further
illustration
of
this
law
when
we
examine
people
as
they
read
for
they
involuntarily
accompany
the
reading
with
movements
of
speech
measurable
in
the
muscles
of
the
throat
the
tongue
and
the
lips
these
facts
and
many
others
constitute
good
evidence
for
the
statement
that
ideas
seek
expression
in
movement
the
ethical
consequences
of
this
are
so
momentous
that
we
must
remark
upon
them
in
passing
we
now
see
the
force
of
the
biblical
statement
not
that
which
entereth
into
the
mouth
defileth
the
man
but
that
which
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
this
defileth
the
man
think
what
it
means
to
one
character
that
every
thought
harbored
in
the
mind
is
bound
to
come
out
it
may
not
manifest
itself
at
once
in
overt
action
but
it
affects
the
motor
pathways
and
either
weakens
or
strengthens
connections
so
that
when
the
opportunity
comes
some
act
will
be
furthered
or
hindered
in
view
of
the
proneness
to
permit
base
thoughts
to
enter
the
mind
human
beings
might
sometimes
fear
even
to
think
a
more
optimistic
idea
however
is
that
noble
thoughts
lead
to
noble
acts
therefore
keep
in
your
mind
the
kind
of
thoughts
that
you
wish
to
see
actualized
in
your
character
and
the
appropriate
acts
will
follow
of
their
own
accord
but
it
is
with
the
significance
of
expressions
in
study
that
we
are
at
present
concerned
and
here
we
find
them
of
supreme
importance
we
ordinarily
regard
learning
as
a
process
of
taking
things
into
the
mind
and
regard
expression
as
a
thing
apart
from
acquisition
of
knowledge
we
shall
find
in
this
discussion
however
that
there
is
no
such
sharp
demarcation
between
acquiring
knowledge
and
expressing
knowledge
but
that
the
two
are
intimately
bound
together
expressions
being
properly
a
part
of
wise
and
economical
learning
when
we
survey
the
modes
of
expression
that
may
be
used
in
study
we
find
them
to
be
of
several
kinds
speech
is
one
this
is
the
form
of
expression
for
which
the
is
provided
if
you
wish
to
grow
as
a
student
utilize
the
recitation
period
and
welcome
every
chance
to
recite
orally
for
things
about
which
you
recite
in
class
are
more
effectively
learned
talking
about
a
subject
under
all
circumstances
will
help
you
learn
when
studying
subjects
like
political
economy
sociology
or
psychology
seize
every
opportunity
to
talk
over
the
questions
involved
hold
frequent
conferences
with
your
instructor
voice
your
difficulties
freely
and
the
very
effort
to
state
them
will
help
to
clarify
them
it
is
a
good
plan
for
two
students
in
the
same
course
to
come
together
and
talk
over
the
problems
the
debates
thus
stimulated
and
the
questions
aroused
by
mental
interaction
are
very
helpful
in
impressing
facts
more
vividly
upon
the
mind
writing
is
a
form
of
expression
and
is
one
thing
that
gives
value
to
and
examinations
its
value
is
further
recognized
by
the
requirements
of
themes
and
these
are
all
mediums
by
which
you
may
develop
yourself
and
they
merit
your
earnest
cooperation
another
medium
of
expression
that
students
may
profitably
employ
is
drawing
this
is
especially
valuable
in
such
subjects
as
geology
physiology
and
botany
students
in
botany
are
compelled
to
do
much
drawing
of
the
which
they
study
and
this
is
a
wise
requirement
for
it
makes
them
observe
more
carefully
report
more
faithfully
and
recall
with
greater
ease
you
may
secure
the
same
advantages
by
employing
the
graphic
method
in
other
studies
for
example
when
reading
in
a
geology
about
the
stratification
of
the
earth
in
a
certain
region
draw
the
parts
described
and
label
them
according
to
the
description
you
will
be
surprised
to
see
how
clear
the
description
becomes
and
how
easily
it
is
later
recalled
let
us
examine
the
effects
of
the
expressive
movements
of
speech
writing
and
the
like
and
see
the
mechanism
by
which
they
facilitate
the
study
process
we
may
describe
their
effects
in
two
ways
neurologically
and
psychologically
as
may
be
expected
from
our
preliminary
study
of
the
nervous
system
we
see
their
first
effects
upon
the
motor
pathways
leading
out
to
the
muscles
each
passage
of
the
nerve
current
from
brain
to
muscle
leaves
traces
so
that
the
resulting
act
is
performed
with
greater
ease
upon
each
repetition
this
fact
has
already
been
emphasized
by
the
warning
guard
the
avenues
of
expression
especially
is
it
important
at
the
first
performance
of
an
act
because
this
determines
the
path
of
later
performances
in
such
studies
as
vocalizing
and
pronunciation
of
foreign
words
see
that
your
first
performance
is
absolutely
right
then
as
the
expressive
movements
are
repeated
they
will
be
more
firmly
ingrained
because
of
the
deepening
of
the
motor
pathways
the
next
effect
of
acts
of
expression
is
to
be
found
in
the
modifications
made
in
the
sensory
areas
of
the
brain
you
will
recall
that
every
movement
of
a
muscle
produces
nervous
currents
which
go
back
to
the
brain
and
register
there
in
the
form
of
kinaesthetic
sensations
to
demonstrate
kinaesthetic
sensations
close
your
eyes
and
move
your
index
finger
up
and
down
you
can
feel
the
muscles
contracting
and
the
tendons
moving
back
and
forth
even
into
the
back
of
the
hand
these
sensations
ordinarily
escape
our
attention
but
they
occupy
a
prominent
place
in
the
control
of
our
actions
for
example
when
ascending
familiar
stairs
in
the
dark
they
notify
us
when
we
have
reached
the
top
we
are
still
further
impressed
with
their
importance
when
we
are
deprived
of
them
when
we
try
to
walk
upon
a
foot
or
a
leg
that
has
gone
to
sleep
that
is
when
the
kinaesthetic
nerves
are
temporarily
paralyzed
we
find
it
difficult
to
walk
but
besides
being
used
to
control
muscular
actions
they
may
be
used
in
study
for
they
may
be
made
the
source
of
impressions
and
impressions
as
we
learned
in
the
chapter
on
memory
are
a
prime
requisite
for
learning
each
expression
becomes
then
through
its
kinaesthetic
results
the
source
of
new
impressions
when
for
example
you
pronounce
the
german
word
with
the
english
word
to
employ
in
addition
to
the
impressions
made
through
the
ear
you
make
impressions
through
the
muscles
of
speech
kinaesthetic
impressions
and
these
kinaesthetic
impressions
enter
into
the
body
of
your
knowledge
and
later
may
serve
as
the
means
by
which
the
word
may
be
revived
when
you
write
the
word
you
make
kinaesthetic
impressions
which
may
later
serve
as
forms
of
revival
so
the
movements
of
expression
produce
sensory
material
that
may
serve
as
tentacles
by
means
of
which
you
can
later
reach
back
into
your
memory
and
recall
facts
we
shall
now
consider
another
service
of
expressions
which
though
little
regarded
nevertheless
is
of
much
moment
when
we
make
expressive
movements
much
nervous
energy
is
generated
much
more
than
during
passive
impression
energy
is
sent
back
to
the
brain
over
the
kinaesthetic
nerve
cells
and
the
greater
the
extent
of
the
movement
the
greater
is
the
amount
of
new
energy
sent
to
the
brain
it
pours
into
the
brain
and
diffuses
itself
especially
throughout
the
association
areas
here
it
excites
regions
which
could
not
be
excited
by
a
more
limited
amount
of
energy
this
means
in
psychical
terms
that
new
ideas
are
being
aroused
the
obvious
inference
from
this
fact
is
that
you
may
by
starting
movements
of
expression
actually
summon
to
your
assistance
added
powers
of
mind
for
example
when
you
are
called
upon
to
recite
in
class
your
mind
seems
to
be
a
complete
blank
in
a
state
of
deadlock
you
may
break
this
deadlock
and
start
by
some
kind
of
movement
it
may
be
only
to
clear
your
throat
to
ejaculate
well
or
to
squirm
about
in
the
seat
but
whatever
form
the
movement
takes
it
will
usually
be
effective
in
creating
the
desired
nervous
energy
and
after
the
inertia
is
once
overcome
the
mental
stream
will
flow
freely
the
unconscious
application
of
this
device
is
seen
when
a
man
is
called
on
suddenly
to
make
a
speech
for
which
he
has
not
prepared
he
usually
starts
out
by
telling
a
story
thus
liberating
nervous
energy
to
pour
back
into
the
brain
and
start
thinking
processes
with
increasing
vehemence
of
expression
the
ideas
come
more
and
more
freely
and
the
result
is
a
speech
which
surpasses
the
expectations
of
the
speaker
himself
the
gesticulations
of
many
speakers
have
this
same
function
being
frequently
of
great
service
in
arousing
more
nervous
energy
which
goes
back
to
the
brain
and
arouses
more
ideas
the
device
of
stimulating
ideas
by
expressive
movements
may
be
utilized
in
or
it
is
generally
recognized
that
the
difficult
thing
in
such
writing
is
to
get
a
start
and
the
too
common
practice
is
to
sit
listlessly
gazing
into
space
waiting
for
inspiration
this
is
usually
a
futile
procedure
the
better
way
is
to
begin
to
write
anything
about
the
topic
in
hand
what
you
write
may
have
little
merit
either
of
substance
or
form
nevertheless
if
you
persist
in
keeping
up
the
activity
of
writing
making
more
and
more
movements
you
will
find
that
the
ideas
will
begin
to
come
in
greater
profusion
until
they
come
so
fast
you
can
hardly
write
them
down
having
tried
to
picture
the
neural
effect
of
expression
we
may
now
translate
them
into
psychological
terms
asking
what
service
the
expressions
render
to
the
conscious
side
of
our
study
first
of
all
we
note
that
the
expressions
help
to
make
the
acts
and
ideas
in
study
habitual
we
find
ourselves
with
each
expression
better
able
to
perform
such
acts
as
the
pronunciation
of
foreign
words
second
they
furnish
new
impressions
through
the
kinaesthetic
sense
thus
being
a
source
of
third
they
give
rise
to
a
greater
number
of
ideas
and
link
them
up
with
the
idea
dominant
at
the
moment
there
is
a
further
psychological
effect
of
expression
in
the
clarification
of
ideas
it
is
a
fact
that
when
we
attempt
to
explain
a
thing
to
someone
else
it
becomes
clearer
in
our
own
minds
you
can
demonstrate
this
for
yourself
by
attempting
to
explain
to
someone
an
intricate
conception
such
as
the
nebular
hypothesis
the
effort
involved
in
making
the
explanation
makes
the
fact
more
vivid
to
you
the
habit
of
thus
utilizing
your
knowledge
in
conversation
is
an
excellent
one
to
acquire
indeed
expression
is
the
only
objective
test
of
knowledge
and
we
can
not
say
that
we
really
know
until
we
can
express
our
knowledge
expression
is
thus
the
great
clarification
agency
and
the
test
of
knowledge
before
leaving
this
discussion
it
might
be
well
to
remark
upon
one
phase
of
expression
that
is
sometimes
a
source
of
difficulty
this
is
the
embarrassment
incident
to
some
forms
of
expression
notably
oral
many
people
are
deterred
from
utilizing
this
form
of
expression
because
of
shyness
and
embarrassment
in
the
presence
of
others
if
you
have
this
difficulty
in
such
excess
that
it
hinders
you
from
free
expression
resolve
at
once
to
overcome
it
begin
at
the
very
outset
of
your
academic
career
to
form
habits
of
disregarding
your
impulses
to
act
in
frightened
manner
take
a
course
in
public
speaking
the
practice
thus
secured
will
be
a
great
aid
in
developing
habits
of
fearless
and
free
oral
expression
this
discussion
has
shown
that
expression
is
a
powerful
aid
in
learning
and
is
a
most
important
feature
of
mental
life
cultivate
your
powers
of
expression
for
your
college
education
should
consist
not
only
in
the
development
of
habits
of
impression
but
also
in
the
development
of
habits
of
expression
grasp
eagerly
every
opportunity
for
the
development
of
skill
in
clear
and
forceful
expression
devote
assiduous
attention
to
themes
and
all
written
work
and
make
serious
efforts
to
speak
well
remember
you
are
forming
habits
that
will
persist
throughout
your
life
emphasize
therefore
at
every
step
methods
of
expression
for
it
is
this
phase
of
learning
in
which
you
will
find
greatest

chapter

how
to
become
interested
in
a
subject
i
ca
get
interested
in
mediaeval
history
this
illustrates
a
kind
of
complaint
frequently
made
by
college
students
it
is
our
purpose
in
this
chapter
to
show
the
fallacy
of
this
to
prove
that
interest
may
be
developed
in
an
uninteresting
subject
and
to
show
how
in
order
to
lay
a
firm
foundation
for
our
psychologizing
let
us
examine
into
the
nature
of
interest
and
see
what
it
really
is
it
has
been
defined
as
the
recognition
of
a
thing
which
has
been
vitally
connected
with
experience
before
a
thing
recognized
as
old
impulse
to
attend
interest
naturally
arouses
tendencies
to
act
the
root
idea
of
the
term
seems
to
be
that
of
being
engaged
engrossed
or
entirely
taken
up
with
some
activity
because
of
its
recognized
worth
interest
marks
the
annihilation
of
the
distance
between
the
person
and
the
materials
and
results
of
his
action
it
is
the
sign
of
their
organic
union
in
addition
to
the
characteristics
just
mentioned
should
be
noted
the
pleasurableness
that
usually
attends
any
activity
in
which
we
are
interested
a
growing
feeling
of
pleasure
is
the
sign
which
notifies
us
that
we
are
growing
interested
in
a
subject
and
it
is
such
an
aid
in
the
performance
of
work
that
we
should
seek
earnestly
to
acquire
it
in
connection
with
any
work
we
have
to
do
the
persons
who
make
the
complaint
at
the
head
of
this
chapter
notice
that
they
take
interest
easily
in
certain
things
a
jack
london
story
a
dish
of
ice
cream
a
game
and
they
take
interest
in
them
so
spontaneously
and
effortlessly
that
they
think
these
interests
must
be
born
within
them
when
we
examine
carefully
the
interests
of
man
and
trace
their
sources
we
see
that
the
above
view
is
fallacious
we
acquire
most
of
our
interests
in
the
course
of
our
experience
professor
james
asserts
an
adult
man
interests
are
almost
every
one
of
them
intensely
artificial
they
have
been
slowly
built
up
the
objects
of
professional
interest
are
most
of
them
in
their
original
nature
repulsive
but
by
their
connection
with
such
natively
exciting
objects
as
one
personal
fortune
one
social
responsibilities
and
especially
by
the
force
of
inveterate
habit
they
grow
to
be
the
only
things
for
which
in
middle
life
a
man
profoundly
cares
since
interests
are
largely
products
of
experience
then
it
follows
that
if
we
wish
to
have
an
interest
in
a
given
subject
we
must
consciously
and
purposefully
develop
it
there
is
wide
choice
open
to
us
we
may
develop
interest
in
early
victorian
literature
promoting
social
theory
lignitic
rocks
history
of
siam
the
collection
of
scarabs
mediaeval
history
we
should
not
be
deceived
by
the
glibness
of
the
above
statements
into
assuming
that
the
development
of
interest
is
an
easy
matter
it
requires
adherence
to
certain
definite
psychological
laws
which
we
may
call
the
laws
of
interest
the
first
may
be
stated
as
follows
order
to
develop
interest
in
a
subject
secure
information
about
the
force
of
this
law
will
be
apparent
as
soon
as
we
analyze
one
of
our
interests
let
us
take
one
that
is
quite
common
the
interest
which
a
typical
young
girl
takes
in
a
movie
star
her
interest
in
him
comes
largely
from
what
she
has
been
able
to
learn
about
him
the
names
of
the
productions
in
which
he
has
appeared
his
age
the
color
of
his
automobile
his
favorite
novel
her
interest
may
be
said
actually
to
consist
at
least
in
part
of
these
facts
the
astute
press
agent
knows
the
force
of
this
law
and
at
intervals
he
lets
slip
through
bits
of
information
about
the
star
which
fan
the
interest
of
the
fair
devotee
to
a
still
whiter
heat
the
relation
of
information
to
interest
is
still
further
illustrated
by
the
case
of
the
typical
university
professor
or
scientist
he
is
interested
in
certain
objects
of
research
infusoria
electrons
plant
ecology
because
he
knows
so
much
about
them
his
interest
may
be
said
to
partly
of
the
body
of
knowledge
that
he
possesses
he
was
not
always
interested
in
the
specific
obscure
field
but
by
saturating
himself
in
facts
about
it
he
has
developed
an
interest
in
it
amounting
to
passionate
absorption
which
manifests
itself
in
of
such
profundity
as
to
make
him
often
an
object
of
wonder
and
ridicule
let
us
demonstrate
the
application
of
the
law
again
showing
how
interest
may
be
developed
in
a
specific
college
subject
let
us
choose
one
that
is
generally
regarded
as
so
difficult
and
abstract
that
not
many
people
are
interested
in
it
philology
the
study
of
language
as
a
science
let
us
imagine
that
we
are
trying
to
interest
a
student
of
law
in
this
as
a
first
step
we
shall
select
some
legal
term
and
show
what
philology
can
tell
about
it
a
term
frequently
encountered
in
law
is
indenture
a
certain
form
of
contract
philological
researches
have
uncovered
an
interesting
history
regarding
this
word
it
seems
that
in
olden
days
when
two
persons
made
an
agreement
they
wrote
it
on
two
pieces
of
paper
then
notched
the
edges
so
that
when
placed
together
the
notches
on
the
edge
of
one
paper
would
just
match
those
of
the
other
this
protected
both
parties
against
substitution
of
a
fraudulent
contract
at
time
of
fulfillment
still
earlier
in
man
development
before
he
could
write
it
was
customary
to
record
such
agreements
by
breaking
a
stick
in
two
pieces
and
leaving
the
jagged
ends
to
be
fitted
together
at
time
of
fulfillment
sometimes
a
bone
was
used
this
way
because
its
critical
feature
was
the
edge
this
kind
of
contract
was
called
indenture
derived
from
the
root
tooth
the
same
one
from
which
we
derive
our
word
dentist
the
formal
document
which
we
today
call
an
indenture
gives
us
no
hint
of
its
humble
origin
but
the
word
when
analyzed
by
the
technique
of
philology
tells
the
whole
story
and
throws
much
light
upon
the
legal
practices
of
our
forbears
having
discovered
one
such
valuable
fact
in
philology
the
student
of
law
may
be
led
to
investigate
the
science
still
further
and
find
many
more
as
a
result
still
he
will
become
interested
in
philology
by
this
illustration
we
have
demonstrated
the
first
psychological
law
of
interest
and
also
its
corollary
which
is
the
new
in
terms
of
the
for
we
not
only
gave
our
lawyer
new
information
culled
from
philological
sources
we
also
introduced
our
fact
in
terms
of
an
old
fact
which
was
already
interesting
to
the
lawyer
this
is
recognized
as
such
an
important
principle
in
education
that
it
has
become
embodied
in
a
maxim
proceed
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
a
classic
example
of
good
educational
practice
in
this
connection
is
the
way
in
which
francis
parker
a
progressive
educator
of
a
former
generation
taught
geography
when
he
desired
to
show
how
water
running
over
hard
rocky
soil
produced
a
niagara
he
took
his
class
down
to
the
creek
behind
the
school
house
built
a
dam
and
allowed
the
water
to
flow
over
it
when
he
wished
to
show
how
water
flowing
over
soft
ground
resulted
in
a
deltoid
nile
he
took
the
class
to
a
low
flat
portion
of
the
creek
bed
and
pointed
out
the
effect
the
creek
bed
constituted
an
old
familiar
element
in
the
children
experience
niagara
and
the
nile
described
in
terms
of
it
were
intelligible
naturally
in
modern
educational
practice
it
is
not
always
possible
to
have
miniature
waterfalls
and
river
bottoms
at
hand
still
it
is
possible
to
follow
this
principle
when
in
studying
mediaeval
history
you
read
a
description
of
the
guilds
do
not
regard
them
as
distant
cold
inert
institutions
devoid
of
significance
in
your
life
rather
think
of
them
in
terms
of
things
you
already
know
modern
labor
unions
technical
schools
in
so
far
as
the
comparison
holds
good
then
trace
their
industrial
descendants
down
to
the
present
time
by
thus
thinking
about
the
guilds
hitherto
distant
and
uninteresting
you
will
begin
to
see
them
suffused
with
meaning
alight
with
significance
a
real
part
of
yourself
in
short
you
will
have
achieved
interest
there
is
still
another
psychological
law
of
interest
order
to
develop
interest
in
a
subject
exert
activity
toward
we
see
the
force
of
this
law
when
we
observe
a
man
in
the
process
of
developing
an
interest
in
golf
at
the
start
he
may
have
no
interest
in
it
whatever
he
may
even
deride
it
yielding
to
the
importunities
of
his
friends
however
he
takes
his
stick
in
hand
and
samples
the
game
then
he
begins
to
relent
admits
that
perhaps
there
may
be
something
interesting
about
the
game
after
all
as
he
practises
with
greater
frequency
he
begins
to
develop
a
warmer
and
still
warmer
interest
until
finally
he
thinks
of
little
else
neglecting
social
and
professional
obligations
and
boring
his
friends
with
recitals
of
golfing
incidents
the
methods
by
which
the
golfer
develops
an
interest
in
golf
will
apply
with
equal
effectiveness
in
the
case
of
a
student
in
trying
to
become
interested
in
mediaeval
history
keep
actively
engaged
in
it
read
book
after
book
dealing
with
the
subject
apply
it
to
your
studies
in
political
economy
english
and
american
history
choose
in
mediaeval
history
as
the
subjects
for
themes
in
english
composition
courses
try
to
help
some
other
student
in
the
class
take
part
in
class
discussions
and
talk
informally
with
the
instructor
outside
of
the
classroom
use
your
ingenuity
to
devise
methods
of
keeping
active
toward
the
subject
presently
you
will
discover
that
the
subject
no
longer
appears
cold
and
forbidding
but
that
it
glows
warm
with
virility
that
it
has
become
interesting
it
will
readily
be
noticed
that
the
two
laws
of
interest
here
set
forth
are
closely
interrelated
one
can
hardly
seek
information
about
a
subject
without
exerting
activity
toward
it
conversely
one
can
not
maintain
activity
on
behalf
of
a
subject
without
at
the
same
time
acquiring
information
about
it
these
two
and
rules
of
study
will
go
far
toward
solving
some
of
the
most
trying
conditions
of
student
life
memorize
them
apply
them
and
you
will
find
yourself
in
possession
of
a
power
which
will
stay
with
you
long
after
you
quit
college
walls
one
which
you
may
apply
with
profit
in
many
different
situations
of
life
we
have
shown
in
this
chapter
the
fallacy
of
the
assumption
that
a
student
can
not
become
genuinely
interested
in
a
subject
which
at
first
seems
uninteresting
we
have
shown
that
he
may
develop
interest
in
any
subject
if
he
but
employs
the
proper
psychological
methods
that
he
must
obey
the
law
secure
information
about
the
subject
stating
the
new
in
terms
of
the
old
and
exert
activity
toward
it
that
when
he
has
thus
lighted
the
flame
of
interest
he
will
find
his
entire
intellectual
life
illuminated
glowing
with
purpose
resplendent
with
success
in
concluding
this
discussion
we
should
note
the
wide
difference
between
the
quality
of
study
which
is
done
with
interest
and
that
done
without
it
under
the
latter
condition
the
student
is
a
slave
a
drudge
under
the
former
a
god
a
creator
touched
by
the
galvanic
spark
he
sees
new
significance
in
every
page
in
every
line
as
his
vision
enlarges
he
perceives
new
relations
between
his
study
and
his
future
aims
indeed
between
his
study
and
the
progress
of
the
universe
and
he
goes
to
his
educational
tasks
not
as
a
prisoner
weighted
down
by
ball
and
chain
but
as
an
eager
prospector
infatuated
by
the
lust
for
gold
encouraged
by
the
continual
stores
of
new
things
he
uncovers
intoxicated
by
the
ozone
of
mental
activity
he
delves
continually
deeper
until
finally
he
emerges
rich
with
knowledge
and
full
of
power
the
intellectual
power
that
signifies
mastery
over
a
subject

the
following
specific
steps
toward
this
end
chapter
xii
the
plateau
of
despond
in
our
investigation
of
the
psychology
of
study
we
have
so
far
directed
our
attention
chiefly
toward
the
subjective
side
of
the
question
seeking
to
discover
the
of
mind
during
study
we
shall
now
take
an
objective
view
of
study
examining
not
the
contents
of
mind
nor
methods
of
study
but
the
objective
results
of
study
in
doing
this
we
choose
certain
units
of
measurement
the
number
of
minutes
required
for
learning
a
given
amount
or
the
amount
learned
in
a
stated
period
of
time
we
may
do
this
for
the
learning
of
any
material
whether
it
be
greek
verbs
or
typewriting
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
decide
upon
some
method
by
which
progress
can
be
noted
and
expressed
in
numerical
units
this
you
will
observe
constitutes
a
statistical
approach
to
the
processes
of
study
such
as
is
employed
in
science
and
just
as
the
statistical
method
has
been
useful
in
science
so
it
may
be
of
value
in
education
and
by
means
of
statistical
investigations
of
learning
we
may
hope
to
discover
some
of
the
factors
operative
in
good
learning
progress
in
learning
is
best
observable
when
we
represent
our
measurements
graphically
when
they
take
the
form
of
a
curve
variously
called
the
curve
of
efficiency
practice
curve
learning
curve
we
shall
take
a
sample
curve
for
the
basis
of
our
discussion
showing
the
progress
of
a
beginner
in
the
russian
language
for
days
indicated
in
the
figure
by
horizontal
divisions
the
student
studied
industriously
for
thirty
minutes
each
day
and
then
translated
as
rapidly
as
possible
for
fifteen
minutes
the
number
of
words
translated
being
represented
by
the
vertical
spaces
on
the
chart

on
the
tenth

were
translated

the
twentieth

illustration

study
of
russian
in
making
an
analysis
of
this
typical
curve
we
note
immediately
an
exceeding
irregularity
at
one
time
there
is
extraordinary
improvement
but
a
later
measurement
registers
pronounced
loss
this
irregularity
is
very
common
in
learning
some
days
we
do
a
great
amount
of
work
and
do
it
well
but
perhaps
the
very
next
day
shows
marked
diminution
in
our
work
the
second
characteristic
we
note
is
that
there
is
extremely
rapid
progress
at
the
beginning
the
curve
slanting
up
quite
sharply
this
is
common
in
learning
and
may
be
accounted
for
in
several
ways
in
the
first
place
the
easiest
things
come
first
for
example
when
you
are
beginning
the
study
of
german
you
are
given
mostly
monosyllabic
words
to
learn
these
are
easily
remembered
hence
progress
is
rapid
a
second
reason
is
that
at
the
beginning
there
are
many
different
respects
in
which
progress
can
be
made
for
example
the
beginner
in
german
must
learn
nouns
case
endings
declension
of
adjectives
days
of
the
week
in
short
a
vast
number
of
new
things
all
at
once
at
a
later
period
however
the
number
of
new
things
to
be
learned
is
much
smaller
and
improvement
can
not
be
so
rapid
a
third
reason
why
learning
proceeds
more
rapidly
at
first
is
that
the
interest
is
greater
at
this
time
you
have
doubtless
many
times
experienced
this
fact
and
you
know
that
when
a
thing
has
the
interest
of
novelty
you
work
harder
upon
it
if
you
will
examine
the
learning
curve
closely
you
will
note
that
after
the
initial
spurt
there
is
a
slowing
up
the
curve
at
this
point
resembles
a
plateau
and
indicates
cessation
of
progress
if
not
retrogression
this
period
of
no
progress
is
regarded
as
a
characteristic
of
the
learning
curve
and
is
a
time
of
great
discouragement
to
the
conscientious
student
so
distressing
that
we
may
designate
it
the
plateau
of
despond
most
people
describe
it
as
a
time
when
they
feel
unable
to
learn
more
about
a
subject
the
mind
seems
to
be
sated
new
ideas
can
not
be
assimilated
and
old
ones
seem
to
be
forgotten
the
plateau
may
extend
for
a
long
or
a
short
time
depending
upon
the
nature
of
the
and
the
length
of
time
over
which
the
learning
extends
in
the
case
of
professional
training
it
may
extend
over
a
year
or
more
in
the
case
of
growing
children
in
school
it
sometimes
happens
that
an
entire
year
elapses
during
which
the
learning
of
an
apparently
bright
student
is
retarded
in
a
course
of
study
in
high
school
or
college
it
may
come
on
about
the
third
week
and
extend
a
month
or
more
something
akin
to
the
plateau
may
come
in
the
course
of
a
day
when
we
realize
that
our
efficiency
is
greatly
diminished
and
we
seem
for
an
hour
or
more
to
make
no
progress
inasmuch
as
the
plateau
is
such
a
common
occurrence
in
human
activity
we
should
analyze
it
and
see
what
factors
operate
to
influence
it
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
plateau
generally
occurs
just
before
an
abrupt
rise
in
efficiency
this
is
significant
for
it
may
mean
that
the
plateau
is
necessary
in
learning
especially
just
before
reaching
the
really
advanced
stages
of
proficiency
accordingly
when
you
are
experiencing
a
plateau
in
the
mastery
of
some
accomplishment
you
may
perhaps
derive
some
comfort
from
the
prospect
of
an
approaching
rise
in
efficiency
on
the
theory
that
it
is
a
necessary
part
of
learning
it
has
been
regarded
as
a
resting
place
we
are
so
constituted
by
nature
that
we
can
not
run
on
indefinitely
nature
sometimes
must
call
a
halt
consequently
the
plateau
may
be
a
warning
that
we
can
not
learn
more
for
the
present
and
that
the
proper
remedy
is
to
refrain
for
a
little
while
from
further
efforts
in
that
line
we
have
possible
justification
for
this
interpretation
when
we
reflect
that
a
vacation
does
us
much
good
and
though
we
begin
it
feeling
stale
we
end
it
feeling
much
fresher
and
more
efficient
but
to
stop
work
temporarily
is
not
the
only
way
to
meet
a
plateau
and
fatigue
or
ennui
is
probably
not
the
sole
or
most
compelling
explanation
it
may
be
that
we
should
not
regard
the
objective
results
as
the
true
measure
of
learning
perhaps
learning
is
going
on
even
though
the
results
are
not
apparent
we
discovered
something
in
the
nature
of
unconscious
learning
in
our
discussion
of
memory
and
it
may
be
that
a
period
of
little
objective
progress
marks
a
period
of
active
unconscious
learning
another
meaning
which
the
plateau
may
have
is
simply
to
mark
places
of
greater
difficulty
as
already
remarked
the
early
period
is
a
stage
of
comparative
ease
but
as
the
work
becomes
more
difficult
progress
is
slower
it
is
also
quite
likely
that
the
plateau
may
indicate
that
some
of
the
factors
operative
at
the
start
are
operative
no
longer
thus
although
the
learning
was
rapid
at
the
beginning
because
the
material
learned
at
that
time
was
easy
the
plateau
may
come
because
the
things
to
be
learned
have
become
difficult
or
whereas
the
beginning
was
attacked
with
considerable
interest
the
plateau
may
mean
that
the
interest
is
dying
down
and
that
less
effort
is
being
exerted
if
these
theories
are
the
true
explanation
of
the
plateau
we
see
that
it
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
a
time
of
reduction
in
learning
to
be
contemplated
with
despair
the
appropriate
attitude
may
be
one
of
resignation
with
the
determination
to
make
it
as
slightly
disturbing
as
possible
but
though
the
reasons
just
described
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
production
of
the
plateau
as
yet
we
have
no
evidence
that
the
plateau
can
not
be
dispensed
with
it
is
practically
certain
that
the
plateau
is
not
caused
entirely
by
necessity
for
rest
or
unconscious
learning
it
frequently
is
due
we
must
regretfully
admit
to
poor
early
preparation
if
at
the
beginning
of
a
period
of
learning
an
insecure
foundation
is
laid
it
can
not
be
expected
to
support
the
burden
of
more
difficult
we
have
enumerated
a
number
of
the
explanations
that
have
been
advanced
to
account
for
the
plateau
and
have
seen
that
it
may
have
several
causes
among
which
are
necessity
for
rest
increased
difficulty
of
loss
of
interest
and
insufficient
preparation
in
trying
to
eliminate
the
plateau
our
remedy
should
be
adapted
to
the
cause
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
learning
proceeds
irregularly
we
see
that
it
is
rational
to
expect
the
amount
of
effort
to
be
exerted
throughout
a
period
of
learning
to
vary
it
will
vary
partly
with
the
difficulty
of
and
partly
with
fluctuations
in
bodily
and
mental
efficiency
which
are
bound
to
occur
from
day
to
day
since
this
irregularity
is
bound
to
occur
you
may
well
make
your
effort
vary
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
at
times
perhaps
your
most
profitable
move
may
be
to
take
a
complete
vacation
the
vacation
might
cover
several
weeks
a
or
if
the
plateau
is
merely
a
low
period
in
the
day
work
then
ten
minutes
may
suffice
for
a
vacation
as
an
adjunct
to
such
rest
periods
some
form
of
recreation
should
usually
be
planned
for
the
essential
thing
is
to
permit
the
mind
to
rest
from
the
tiresome
activity
if
your
plateau
represents
greater
difficulty
of
and
loss
of
interest
your
duty
is
plainly
to
work
harder
in
exerting
more
effort
make
some
changes
in
your
methods
of
study
for
example
if
you
have
been
accustomed
to
study
a
certain
subject
by
silent
reading
begin
to
read
your
lessons
aloud
change
your
method
of
taking
notes
or
change
the
hour
of
day
in
which
you
prepare
your
lesson
in
short
try
any
of
the
methods
described
in
this

and
use
your
own
ingenuity
and
the
change
in
method
may
overcome
the
plateau
if
a
plateau
is
due
to
our
cause
insufficient
preparation
the
remedy
must
be
drastic
to
make
new
resolutions
and
to
put
forth
additional
effort
is
not
enough
you
must
go
back
and
relay
the
foundation
make
a
thorough
review
of
the
work
which
you
covered
slightingly
making
sure
that
every
step
is
clear
this
process
was
described
in
an
earlier
chapter
as
the
clarification
of
ideas
and
is
absolutely
essential
in
building
up
a
structure
of
knowledge
that
will
stand
indeed
as
you
take
various
courses
you
will
find
that
your

improved
by
periodical
reviews
the
benefits
can
not
all
be
enumerated
here
but
we
may
reasonably
claim
that
a
review
will
be
very
likely
to
remove
a
plateau

used
with
the
other

mental
did
you
ever
engage
in
any
exhausting
physical
work
for
a
long
period
of
time
if
so
you
probably
remember
that
as
you
proceeded
you
became
more
and
more
fatigued
finally
reaching
a
point
when
it
seemed
that
you
could
not
endure
the
strain
another
minute
you
had
just
decided
to
give
up
when
suddenly
the
fatigue
seemed
to
diminish
and
new
energy
seemed
to
come
from
some
source
this
curious
thing
which
happens
frequently
in
athletic
activities
is
known
as
and
is
described
by
those
who
have
experienced
it
as
a
time
of
increased
power
when
the
work
is
done
with
greater
ease
and
effectiveness
and
with
a
freshness
and
vigor
in
great
contrast
to
the
staleness
that
preceded
it
it
is
as
though
one
tapped
a
level
of
new
energy
revealing
hidden
stores
of
unexpected
power
and
it
is
commonly
reported
that
with
persistence
in
pushing
one
self
farther
and
farther
a
third
and
fourth
wind
may
be
uncovered
each
one
leading
to
greater
heights
of
achievement
this
phenomenon
occurs
not
alone
on
the
physical
plane
it
is
discernible
in
mental
exertion
as
well
true
we
seldom
experience
it
because
we
are
mentally
lazy
and
have
the
habit
of
stopping
our
work
at
the
first
signs
of
fatigue
did
we
persist
however
disregarding
fatigue
and
ennui
we
should
find
ourselves
tapping
vast
reserves
of
mental
power
and
accomplishing
mental
feats
of
astonishing
brilliancy
the
occasional
occurrence
of
the
phenomenon
of
gives
ground
for
the
statement
that
we
possess
more
energy
than
we
ordinarily
use
there
are
several
lines
of
evidence
for
this
statement
one
is
to
be
found
in
the
energizing
effects
of
emotional
excitement
under
the
impetus
of
anger
a
man
shows
far
greater
strength
than
he
ordinarily
uses
similarly
a
mother
manifests
the
strength
of
a
tigress
when
her
young
is
endangered
a
second
line
of
evidence
is
furnished
by
the
effect
of
stimulants
alcohol
brings
to
the
fore
surprising
reserves
of
physical
and
psychic
energy
lastly
we
have
innumerable
instances
of
accession
of
strength
under
the
stimulus
of
an
idea
under
the
domination
of
an
idea
one
performs
feats
of
extraordinary
strength
utilizing
stores
of
energy
otherwise
out
of
reach
we
have
only
to
read
of
the
heroic
achievements
of
little
joan
of
arc
for
an
example
of
such
manifestation
of
reserve
power
when
we
examine
this
accession
of
energy
we
find
it
to
be
describable
in
several
ways
physiologically
neurologically
and
psychologically
the
physiological
effects
consist
in
a
heightening
of
the
bodily
functions
in
general
the
muscles
become
more
ready
to
act
the
circulation
is
accelerated
the
breathing
more
rapid
curious
things
take
place
in
various
glands
throughout
the
body
one
the
adrenal
gland
has
been
the
object
of
special
study
and
has
been
shown
upon
the
arousal
of
these
reserves
of
energy
to
produce
a
secretion
of
the
utmost
importance
in
providing
for
sudden
emergencies
this
little
gland
is
located
above
the
kidney
and
is
aroused
to
intense
activity
at
times
pouring
out
into
the
blood
a
fluid
that
goes
all
over
the
body
some
of
its
effects
are
to
furnish
the
blood
with
chemicals
that
act
as
fuel
to
the
muscles
assisting
them
to
contract
more
vigorously
to
make
the
lungs
more
active
in
introducing
oxygen
into
the
system
to
make
the
heart
more
active
in
distributing
the
blood
throughout
the
body
such
glandular
activity
is
an
important
physiological
condition
of
these
higher
levels
of
energy
in
neurological
terms
the
increase
in
energy
consists
in
the
flow
of
more
nervous
energy
into
the
brain
particularly
into
those
areas
where
it
is
needed
for
certain
kinds
of
controlled
thought
and
action
an
abundance
of
nervous
energy
is
very
advantageous
for
as
has
been
intimated
in
a
former
chapter
nervous
energy
is
diffused
and
spread
over
all
the
pathways
that
are
easily
permeable
to
its
distribution
this
results
in
the
use
of
considerable
areas
of
brain
surface
and
knits
up
many
associations
so
that
one
idea
calls
up
many
other
ideas
this
leads
us
to
recognize
the
psychological
conditions
of
increased
energy
which
are
first
the
presence
of
more
ideas
second
the
more
facile
flow
of
ideas
the
whole
accompanied
by
a
state
of
marked
pleasurableness
pleasure
is
a
notable
effect
of
increased
energy
when
work
progresses
rapidly
and
satisfactorily
it
is
accomplished
with
great
zest
and
a
feeling
almost
akin
to
exaltation
these
conditions
describe
to
some
degree
the
conditions
when
we
are
doing
efficient
work
since
we
are
endowed
with
the
energy
requisite
for
such
efficient
work
the
obvious
question
is
why
do
we
not
more
frequently
use
it
the
answer
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
we
have
formed
the
habit
of
giving
up
before
we
create
conditions
of
high
efficiency
you
will
note
that
the
conditions
require
exertion
and
resolute
persistence
this
is
difficult
and
we
indulgently
succumb
to
the
first
symptoms
of
fatigue
before
we
have
more
than
scratched
the
surface
of
our
real
potentialities
because
of
the
prominent
place
occupied
by
fatigue
in
thus
being
responsible
for
our
diminished
output
we
shall
briefly
consider
its
place
in
study
everyone
who
has
studied
will
agree
that
fatigue
is
an
almost
invariable
attendant
of
continuous
mental
exertion
we
shall
lay
down
the
proposition
at
the
start
however
that
the
awareness
of
fatigue
is
not
the
same
as
the
objective
fatigue
in
the
organs
of
the
body
fatigue
should
be
regarded
as
a
twofold
thing
a
state
of
mind
designated
its
subjective
aspect
and
a
condition
of
various
parts
of
the
body
designated
its
objective
aspect
the
former
is
observable
by
introspection
the
latter
by
analysis
of
bodily
secretions
and
by
measurement
of
the
diminution
of
work
entirely
without
reference
to
the
way
the
mind
regards
the
work
fatigue
subjectively
or
fatigue
as
we
it
is
not
at
all
the
same
as
fatigue
as
manifested
in
the
body
if
we
were
to
make
two
curves
the
one
showing
the
advancement
of
the
of
fatigue
and
the
other
showing
the
advancement
of
impotence
on
the
part
of
the
bodily
processes
the
two
curves
would
not
at
all
coincide
stated
another
way
fatigue
is
a
complex
thing
a
product
of
ideas
feelings
and
sensations
and
sometimes
the
ideas
overbalance
the
sensations
and
we
think
we
are
more
tired
then
we
are
objectively
it
is
this
fact
that
accounts
for
our
too
rapid
giving
up
when
we
are
engaged
in
hard
work
a
psychological
analysis
of
the
subjective
side
of
fatigue
will
make
its
true
nature
more
apparent
probably
the
first
thing
we
find
in
the
mind
when
fatigued
is
a
large
mass
of
sensations
they
are
referred
to
various
parts
of
the
body
mostly
the
part
where
muscular
activity
has
been
most
violent
and
prolonged
not
all
of
the
sensations
however
are
intense
enough
to
be
localizable
some
being
so
vague
that
we
merely
say
we
are
tired
all
over
these
vague
sensations
are
often
overlooked
nevertheless
as
will
be
shown
later
they
may
be
exceedingly
important
but
sensations
are
not
the
only
contents
of
the
mind
at
time
of
fatigue
feelings
are
present
also
usually
of
a
very
unpleasant
kind
they
are
related
partly
to
the
sensations
mentioned
above
which
are
essentially
painful
and
they
are
feelings
of
boredom
and
ennui
we
have
yet
to
examine
the
ideas
in
mind
and
their
behavior
at
time
of
fatigue
they
come
sluggishly
associations
being
made
slowly
and
inaccurately
and
we
make
many
mistakes
but
constriction
of
ideas
is
not
the
sole
effect
of
fatigue
at
such
a
time
there
are
usually
other
ideas
in
the
mind
not
relevant
to
the
fatiguing
task
of
the
moment
and
exceedingly
distracting
often
they
are
so
insistent
in
forcing
themselves
upon
our
attention
that
we
throw
up
the
work
without
further
effort
it
is
practically
certain
that
much
of
our
fatigue
is
due
not
to
real
weariness
and
inability
to
work
but
to
the
presence
of
ideas
that
appear
so
attractive
in
contrast
with
the
work
in
hand
that
we
say
we
are
tired
of
the
latter
what
we
really
mean
is
that
we
would
rather
do
something
else
these
obtruding
ideas
are
often
introduced
into
our
minds
by
other
people
who
tell
us
that
we
have
worked
long
enough
and
ought
to
come
and
play
and
though
we
may
not
have
felt
tired
up
to
this
point
still
the
suggestion
is
so
strong
that
we
immediately
begin
to
feel
tired
various
social
situations
can
arouse
the
same
suggestion
for
example
as
the
clock
nears
quitting
time
we
feel
that
we
ought
to
be
tired
so
we
allow
ourselves
to
think
we
are
let
us
now
examine
the
bodily
conditions
to
see
what
fatigue
is
objectively
physiologically
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
fatigue
is
accompanied
by
three
sorts
of
changes
first
poisons
accumulate
in
the
blood
and
affect
the
action
of
the
nervous
system
as
has
been
shown
by
direct
analysis
mosso
selected
two
dogs
as
nearly
alike
as
possible
one
he
kept
tied
all
day
the
other
he
exercised
until
by
night
it
was
thoroughly
tired
then
he
transfused
the
blood
of
the
tired
animal
into
the
veins
of
the
rested
one
and
produced
in
him
all
the
signs
of
fatigue
that
were
shown
by
the
other
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
waste
products
of
the
body
accumulate
in
the
blood
and
interfere
with
the
action
of
the
nerve
cells
and
muscles
it
is
probable
that
these
accumulations
come
as
a
result
of
mental
as
well
as
of
physical
work
a
second
change
in
fatigue
has
been
found
in
the
cell
body
of
the
neurone
hodge
showed
that
the
size
of
the
nucleus
of
the
cell
in
the
spinal
cord
of
a
bee
diminished
nearly
per
cent
as
a
result
of
the
day
activity
and
that
the
nucleus
became
much
less
solid
a
third
change
that
has
been
demonstrated
as
a
result
of
muscular
work
is
the
accumulation
of
waste
products
in
the
muscle
tissue
fatigued
muscles
contain
considerable
percentages
of
these
products
that
they
are
important
factors
in
the
fatigue
process
has
been
shown
by
washing
them
from
a
fatigued
muscle
as
a
result
the
muscle
gains
new
capacity
for
work
the
experiments
are
performed
on
the
muscles
of
a
frog
that
have
been
cut
from
the
body
and
fatigued
by
electrical
stimulation
when
they
will
no
longer
respond
their
sensitivity
may
be
renewed
by
washing
them
in
dilute
alcohol
or
in
a
weak
salt
solution
that
will
dissolve
the
products
of
fatigue
it
is
probable
that
these
products
stimulate
the
in
the
muscles
and
thus
give
some
of
the
sensations
of
fatigue
of
these
physical
effects
of
fatigue
the
accumulation
of
waste
products
in
the
blood
and
the
effects
upon
the
nerve
cells
are
probably
common
both
to
mental
and
physical
fatigue
the
effect
upon
the
muscles
plays
a
part
in
mental
fatigue
only
so
far
as
all
mental
work
involves
some
muscular
activity
by
this
time
you
must
be
convinced
that
the
subject
of
fatigue
is
exceedingly
complicated
that
its
effects
are
manifested
differently
in
mind
and
body
in
relieving
fatigue
the
first
step
to
be
taken
is
to
rest
properly
man
can
not
work
incessantly
he
must
rest
sometimes
and
it
is
just
as
important
to
know
how
to
rest
efficiently
as
to
know
how
to
work
efficiently
by
this
is
not
meant
that
one
should
rest
as
soon
as
fatigue
begins
to
be
felt
quite
the
reverse
keep
on
working
all
the
harder
if
you
wish
the
to
appear
perhaps
two
hours
will
exhaust
your
first
supply
of
energy
and
will
leave
you
greatly
fatigued
do
not
give
up
at
this
time
however
push
yourself
farther
in
order
to
uncover
the
second
layer
of
energy
before
entering
upon
this
however
it
will
be
possible
to
secure
some
advantage
by
resting
for
about
fifteen
minutes
do
not
rest
longer
than
this
or
you
may
lose
the
momentum
already
secured
and
your
two
hours
will
have
gone
for
naught
if
one
indulges
in
too
long
a
rest
the
energy
seems
to
run
down
and
more
effort
is
required
to
work
it
up
again
than
was
originally
expended
it
is
also
important
to
observe
the
proper
mental
conditions
during
rest
do
not
spend
the
fifteen
minutes
in
getting
interested
in
some
other
object
for
that
will
leave
distracting
ideas
in
the
mind
which
will
persist
when
you
resume
work
make
the
rest
a
time
of
physical
and
mental
relief
move
cramped
muscles
rest
your
eyes
and
let
your
thoughts
idly
wander
then
come
back
to
work
in
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
and
you
will
be
amazed
at
the
refreshed
feeling
with
which
you
do
your
work
and
at
the
accession
of
new
energy
that
will
come
to
you
keep
on
at
this
new
plane
and
your
work
will
take
on
all
the
attributes
of
the
level
of
efficiency
besides
planning
intelligent
rests
you
may
also
adjust
yourself
to
fatigue
by
arranging
your
daily
program
so
as
to
do
your
hardest
work
when
you
are
fresh
and
your
easiest
when
your
efficiency
is
low
in
other
words
you
are
a
human
dynamo
and
should
adjust
yourself
to
the
different
loads
you
carry
when
carrying
a
heavy
load
employ
your
best
energies
but
when
carrying
only
a
light
load
exert
a
proportionate
amount
of
energy
every
student
has
tasks
of
a
routine
nature
which
do
not
require
a
high
degree
of
energy
such
as
copying
material
plan
to
perform
such
work
when
your
stock
of
energy
is
lowest
one
of
the
best
ways
to
insure
the
attainment
of
a
higher
plane
of
mental
efficiency
is
to
assume
an
attitude
of
interestedness
this
is
an
emotional
state
and
we
have
seen
that
emotion
calls
forth
great
energy
a
final
aid
in
promoting
increase
of
energy
is
that
gained
through
stimulating
ideas
other
things
being
equal
the
student
who
is

serves
as
a
powerful
incentive
throughout
one
student
life
an
idea
may
operate
for
even
more
transient
purposes
it
may
make
one
oblivious
to
present
discomfort
to
a
remarkable
degree
this
is
accomplished
through
the
aid
of
suggestion

feelings
of

approach

them
off

yourself

that
a
single
effort
of
the

such
as

to
some
habitual
temptation
or
performing
some
courageous
act
will

the
results
of
exertions
of

are
not

you
may
accept
it
as
a
fact
that
in

you
can
not

examinations
one
of
the
most
vexatious
periods
of
student
life
is
examination
time
this
is
almost
universally
a
time
of
great
distress
giving
rise
in
extreme
cases
to
conditions
of
nervous
collapse
the
reason
for
this
is
not
far
to
seek
for
upon
the
results
of
examinations
frequently
depend
momentous
consequences
such
as
valuable
appointments
diplomas
degrees
and
other
important
events
in
the
life
of
a
student
in
view
of
the
importance
of
examinations
then
it
is
natural
that
they
be
regarded
with
considerable
fear
and
trepidation
and
it
is
important
that
we
devise
what
rules
we
can
for
meeting
their
exactious
demands
with
greatest
ease
and
effectiveness
examinations
serve
several
purposes
the
foremost
of
which
is
to
inform
the
examiner
regarding
the
amount
of
knowledge
possessed
by
the
student
in
discovering
this
two
methods
may
be
employed
first
to
test
whether
or
not
the
student
knows
certain
things
plainly
a
reproductive
exercise
second
to
see
how
well
the
student
can
apply
his
knowledge
but
this
is
not
the
only
function
of
an
examination
it
also
shows
the
student
how
much
he
knows
or
does
not
know
again
the
examination
often
serves
as
an
incentive
to
harder
work
on
the
part
of
the
student
for
if
one
knows
there
will
be
an
examination
in
a
subject
one
usually
studies
with
greater
zeal
than
when
an
examination
is
not
expected
lastly
an
examination
may
help
the
student
to
link
up
facts
in
new
ways
and
to
see
them
in
new
relationships
in
this
aspect
you
readily
see
that
examinations
constitute
a
valuable
device
in
learning
but
students
are
not
very
patient
in
philosophizing
about
the
purpose
of
examinations
declaring
that
if
examinations
are
a
necessary
part
of
the
educational
process
they
wish
some
advice
that
will
enable
them
to
pass
examinations
easily
and
with
credit
to
themselves
so
we
shall
turn
our
attention
to
the
practical
problems
of
passing
examinations
our
first
duty
in
giving
advice
is
to
call
attention
to
the
necessity
for
faithful
work
throughout
the
course
of
study
some
students
seem
to
think
that
they
can
slight
their
work
throughout
a
course
and
by
vigorous
cramming
at
the
end
make
up
for
slighted
work
and
pass
the
examination
this
is
an
extremely
dangerous
attitude
to
take
it
might
work
with
certain
kinds
of
a
certain
type
of
and
a
certain
kind
of
examiner
but
as
a
general
practice
it
is
a
most
treacherous
method
of
passing
a
course
the
greatest
objection
from
a
psychological
standpoint
is
that
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
learning
thus
concentrated
is
not
so
permanently
effective
as
that
extended
over
a
long
period
of
time
for
instance
a
german
course
extending
over
a
year
has
much
to
commend
it
over
a
course
with
the
same
number
of
crowded
into
two
months
we
already
discussed
the
reasons
for
this
in
chapter
vi
when
we
showed
the
beneficial
results
coming
from
the
distribution
of
impressions
over
a
period
of
time
against
cramming
it
may
further
be
urged
that
the
hasty
impression
of
a
mass
of
new
material
is
not
likely
to
be
lasting
particularly
is
this
true
when
the
cramming
is
made
specifically
for
a
certain
examination
as
we
saw
in
the
chapter
on
memory
the
intention
to
remember
affects
the
firmness
of
retention
and
if
the
cramming
is
done
merely
with
reference
to
the
examination
the
facts
learned
may
be
forgotten
and
never
be
available
for
future
use
so
we
may
lay
it
down
as
a
rule
that
feverish
exertions
at
the
end
of
a
course
can
not
replace
conscientious
work
throughout
the
course
in
spite
of
these
objections
however
we
must
admit
that
cramming
has
some
value
if
it
does
not
take
the
form
of
new
acquisition
of
facts
but
consists
more
of
a
manipulation
of
facts
already
learned
as
a
method
of
review
it
has
an
eminently
proper
place
and
may
well
be
regarded
as
indispensable
some
students
it
is
true
assert
that
they
derive
little
benefit
from
a
review
but
one
is
inclined
to
question
their
methods
we
have
already
found
that
learning
is
characteristically
aided
by
reviews
and
that
recall
is
facilitated
by
recency
of
impression
reviewing
just
before
examination
serves
the
memory
by
providing
repetition
and
recency
which
as
we
learned
in
the
chapter
on
memory
are
conditions
for
favorable
impression
a
further
value
of
cramming
is
that
by
means
of
such
a
summarizing
review
one
is
able
to
see
facts
in
a
greater
number
of
relations
than
before
it
too
often
happens
that
when
facts
are
taken
up
in
a
course
they
come
in
a
more
or
less
detached
form
but
at
the
conclusion
of
the
course
a
review
will
show
the
facts
in
perspective
and
will
disclose
many
new
relations
between
them
another
advantage
of
cramming
is
that
at
such
a
time
one
usually
works
at
a
high
plane
of
efficiency
the
task
of
reviewing
in
a
few
hours
the
work
of
an
entire
course
is
so
huge
that
the
attention
is
closely
concentrated
impressions
are
made
vividly
and
the
entire
mentality
is
tuned
up
so
that
facts
are
well
impressed
coordinated
and
retained
these
advantages
are
not
all
present
in
the
more
leisurely
learning
of
a
course
so
we
see
that
cramming
may
be
regarded
as
a
useful
device
in
learning
we
must
not
forget
that
many
of
the
advantages
secured
by
cramming
are
dependent
upon
the
methods
pursued
there
are
good
methods
and
poor
methods
of
cramming
one
of
the
most
reprehensible
of
the
latter
is
to
get
into
a
flurry
and
scramble
madly
through
a
mass
of
facts
without
regard
to
their
relation
to
each
other
this
method
is
characterized
by
breathless
haste
and
an
anxious
fear
lest
something
be
missed
or
forgotten
perhaps
its
most
serious
evil
is
its
formlessness
and
lack
of
plan
in
other
words
the
facts
should
not
be
seized
upon
singly
but
should
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
their
different
relations
with
each
other
suppose
for
example
you
are
reviewing
for
an
examination
in
mediaeval
history
the
important
events
may
be
studied
according
to
countries
studying
one
country
at
a
time
but
that
is
not
sufficient
the
events
occurring
during
one
period
in
one
country
should
be
correlated
with
those
occurring
in
another
country
at
the
same
time
likewise
the
movements
in
the
field
of
science
and
discovery
should
be
correlated
with
movements
in
the
fields
of
literature
religion
and
political
control
tabulate
the
events
in
chronological
order
and
compare
the
different
series
of
events
with
each
other
in
this
way
the
facts
will
be
seen
in
new
relations
and
will
be
more
firmly
impressed
so
that
you
can
use
them
in
answering
a
great
variety
of
questions
having
made
preparation
of
the
of
the
examination
the
next
step
is
to
prepare
yourself
physically
for
the
trying
ordeal
for
it
is
well
known
that
the
mind
acts
more
ably
under
physically
healthful
conditions
go
to
the
with
your
body
rested
after
a
good
night
sleep
eat
sparingly
before
the
examination
for
mental
processes
are
likely
to
be
clogged
if
too
heavy
food
is
taken
having
reached
the
there
are
a
number
of
considerations
that
are
requisite
for
success
some
of
the
advice
here
given
may
seem
to
be
superfluous
but
if
you
had
ever
corrected
examination
papers
you
would
see
the
need
of
it
all
let
your
first
step
consist
of
a
preliminary
survey
of
the
examination
questions
read
them
all
over
slowly
and
thoughtfully
in
order
to
discover
the
extent
of
the
task
set
before
you
a
striking
thing
is
accomplished
by
this
preliminary
reading
of
the
questions
it
seems
as
though
during
the
examination
period
the
knowledge
relating
to
the
different
questions
assembles
itself
and
while
you
are
focusing
your
attention
upon
the
answer
to
one
question
the
answers
to
the
other
questions
are
formulating
themselves
in
your
mind
it
is
a
operation
akin
to
the
unconscious
learning
discussed
in
the
chapter
on
memory
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
it
it
is
necessary
to
have
the
questions
in
mind
as
soon
as
possible
then
it
will
be
found
that
relevant
associations
will
form
and
will
come
to
the
surface
when
you
reach
the
particular
questions
during
the
examination
when
some
of
these
associations
come
into
consciousness
ahead
of
time
it
is
often
wise
to
digress
from
the
question
in
hand
long
enough
to
jot
them
down
by
all
means
preserve
them
for
if
you
do
not
write
them
down
they
may
leave
you
and
be
lost
sometimes
very
brilliant
ideas
come
in
flashes
and
inasmuch
as
they
are
so
fleeting
it
is
wise
to
grasp
them
and
fix
them
while
they
are
fresh
in
writing
the
examination
be
sure
you
read
every
question
carefully
each
question
has
a
definite
point
look
for
it
and
do
not
start
answering
until
you
are
sure
you
have
found
it
discover
the
implications
of
each
question
canvass
its
possible
interpretations
and
if
it
is
at
all
ambiguous
seek
light
from
the
instructor
if
he
is
willing
to
make
any
further
comment
it
is
well
to
have
scratch
paper
handy
and
make
outlines
for
your
answers
to
long
questions
it
is
a
good
plan
also
when
dealing
with
long
questions
to
watch
the
time
carefully
for
there
is
danger
that
you
will
spend
too
much
time
upon
some
question
to
the
detriment
of
others
equally
important
though
shorter
one
error
which
students
often
commit
in
taking
examinations
is
to
waste
time
in
dreaming
as
they
come
upon
a
difficult
question
they
sit
back
and
wait
for
the
answer
to
come
to
them
this
is
the
wrong
plan
the
secret
of
freedom
of
ideas
lies
in
activity
therefore
at
such
times
keep
active
so
that
the
associative
processes
will
operate
freely
stimulate
brain
activity
by
the
method
suggested
in
chapter
x
namely
by
means
of
muscular
activity
instead
of
idly
waiting
for
flashes
of
inspiration
begin
to
write
you
may
not
be
able
to
write
directly
upon
the
point
at
issue
but
you
can
write
something
about
it
and
as
you
begin
to
explore
and
to
express
your
meagre
fund
of
knowledge
one
idea
will
call
up
another
and
soon
the
correct
answer
will
appear
after
you
have
prepared
yourself
to
the
extent
of
your
ability
you
should
maintain
toward
the
examination
an
attitude
of
confidence
believe
firmly
that
you
will
pass
the
examination
make
strong
suggestions
to
yourself
affirming
positively
that
you
have
the
requisite
amount
of
information
and
the
ability
to
express
it
coherently
and
forcefully
fortified
by
the
consciousness
of
faithful
application
throughout
the
work
of
a
course
reinforced
by
a
thorough
review
and
with
a
firm
conviction
in
the
strength
of
your
own
powers

may
approach

bodily
conditions
for
effective
study
it
is
a
truism
to
say
that
mental
ability
is
affected
by
bodily
conditions
a
common
complaint
of
students
is
that
they
can
not
study
because
of
a
headache
or
they
fail
in
class
because
of
loss
of
sleep
so
patent
is
the
interrelation
between
bodily
condition
and
study
that
we
can
not
consider
our
discussion
of
study
problems
complete
without
recognition
of
the
topic
we
shall
group
our
discussions
about
three
of
the
most
important
physical
activities
eating
sleeping
and
exercising
these
make
up
the
greater
part
of
our
daily
activities
and
if
they
are
properly
regulated
our
study
is
likely
to
be
effective
it
is
generally
agreed
that
the
main
function
of
food
is
to
repair
the
tissues
of
the
body
other
effects
are
present
such
as
pleasure
and
sociability
but
its
chief
benefit
is
reparative
so
we
may
well
regard
the
subject
from
a
strictly
utilitarian
standpoint
and
inquire
how
we
may
produce
the
highest
efficiency
from
our
eating
some
of
the
important
questions
about
eating
are
how
much
to
eat
what
kind
of
food
to
eat
when
to
eat
what
are
the
most
favorable
conditions
for
eating
the
quantity
of
food
to
be
taken
varies
with
the
demands
of
the
individual
appetite
and
the
individual
powers
of
absorption
in
general
one
who
is
engaged
in
physical
labor
needs
more
because
of
increased
appetite
and
increased
waste
of
tissues
so
a
needs
more
food
than
a
college
student
whose
work
is
mostly
indoors
and
sedentary
much
has
been
said
recently
about
the
ills
of
overeating
one
of
the
most
enthusiastic
defenders
of
a
decreased
diet
is
horace
fletcher
who
by
the
practice
of
protracted
mastication
contrives
to
satisfy
the
appetite
while
taking
an
exceptionally
small
amount
of
food
salivary
digestion
is
favored
and
the
mechanical
subdivision
of
the
food
is
carried
to
an
extreme
point
remarkably
complete
digestion
and
absorption
follow
by
faithfully
pursuing
this
system
fletcher
has
vastly
bettered
his
general
health
and
is
a
rare
example
of
muscular
and
mental
power
for
a
man
above
sixty
years
of
age
he
is
a
vigorous
pedestrian
and
and
holds
surprising
records
for
endurance
tests
in
the
gymnasium
the
chief
gain
observed
in
his
case
as
in
others
which
are
more
or
less
parallel
is
the
acquiring
of
immunity
to
fatigue
both
muscular
and
central
it
is
not
claimed
that
the
sparing

confers
great
strength
for
momentary
efforts
strength
as
the
term
goes
but
that
moderate
muscular
contractions
may
be
repeated
many
times
with
far
less
discomfort
than
before
the
inference
appears
to
be
that
the
subject
who
eats
more
than
is
best
has
in
his
circulation
and
his
tissues
which
act
like
the
muscular
waste
which
is
normally
responsible
for
fatigue
according
to
this
conception
he
is
never
really
fresh
for
his
task
but
is
obliged
to
start
with
a
handicap
when
he
reduces
his
diet
the
cells
and
fluids
of
his
body
free
themselves
of
these
and
he
realizes
a
capacity
quite
unguessed
in
the
past
the
same
assumption
explains
the
fact
mentioned
by
fletcher
that
the
hours
of
sleep
can
be
reduced
decidedly
when
the
diet
is
cut
down
it
would
seem
as
though
a
part
of
our
sleep
might
often
be
due
to
avoidable
if
one
can
shorten
his
nightly
sleep
without
feeling
the
worse
for
it
this
is
an
important
gain
but
the
amount
of
food
is
probably
not
so
important
as
the
kind
foods
containing
much
starch
as
potatoes
and
rice
may
ordinarily
be
taken
in
greater
quantities
than
foods
containing
much
protein
such
as
meats
and
nuts
so
our
problem
is
not
so
much
concerned
with
quantity
as
with
the
choice
of
kinds
of
food
probably
the
most
favorable
distribution
of
foods
for
students
is
a
predominance
of
fruits
coarse
cereals
starch
and
sugar
and
less
prominence
to
meats
do
not
begin
the
study
on
a
breakfast
of
cakes
they
are
a
heavy
tax
upon
the
digestive
powers
and
their
nutritive
value
is
low
the
meal
is
also
a
crucial
factor
in
determining
the
efficiency
of
afternoon
study
and
many
students
almost
completely
incapacitate
themselves
for
afternoon
work
by
a
noon
meal
frequently
an
afternoon
course
is
rendered
quite
valueless
because
the
student
drowses
through
the
lecture
soddened
by
a
heavy
lunch
one
way
of
overcoming
this
difficulty
is
by
dispensing
with
the
meal
another
way
is
to
drink
a
small
amount
of
coffee
which
frequently
keeps
people
awake
but
these
devices
are
not
to
be
universally
recommended
the
heavy
meal
of
a
student
may
well
come
at
evening
it
should
consist
of
a
varied
assortment
of
foods
with
some
liquids
preferably
clear
soup
milk
and
water
meat
also
forms
a
substantial
part
of
this
meal
though
ordinarily
it
should
not
be
taken
more
than
once
a
day
much
is
heard
nowadays
about
the
dangers
of
excessive
and
the
objections
are
in
the
case
of
the
undesirable
effects
are
an
unprofitable
spurring
of
the
metabolism
more
particularly
objectionable
in
warm
weather
and
the
menace
of
too
much
protein
found
in
meat
lays
a
burden
upon
the
liver
and
kidneys
and
when
the
burden
is
too
great
wastes
which
can
not
be
taken
care
of
gather
and
poison
the
blood
giving
rise
to
that
feeling
of
being
tired
all
over
which
is
so
inimical
to
mental
and
physical
exertion
when
meat
is
eaten
care
should
be
taken
to
choose
right
kinds
some
kinds
of
meat
are
well
known
to
occasion
indigestion
pork
and
veal
are
particularly
feared
while
we
may
not
know
the
reason
why
these
foods
so
often
disagree
with
people
it
seems
probable
that
texture
is
an
important
consideration
in
both
these
meats
the
fibre
is
fine
and
fat
is
intimately
mingled
with
the
lean
a
close
blending
of
fat
with
nitrogenous
matter
appears
to
give
a
fabric
which
is
hard
to
digest
the
same
principle
is
illustrated
by
fried
foods
under
the
cover
of
the
fat
bacterial
decomposition
of
the
proteins
may
be
accomplished
with
the
final
release
of
highly
poisonous
products
attacks
of
acute
indigestion
resulting
from
this
cause
are
much
like
the
ptomaine
poisoning
much
of
the
benefit
of
meat
may
be
secured
from
other
foods
fat
for
example
may
be
obtained
from
milk
and
butter
freed
from
the
objectionable
qualities
of
the
in
this
connection
it
is
important
to
call
attention
to
the
use
of
fried
fat
avoid
fat
that
is
mixed
with
starch
particles
in
such
foods
as
fried
potatoes
and
the
conditions
during
meals
should
always
be
as
pleasant
as
possible
this
refers
both
to
physical
surroundings
and
mental
condition
the
processes
occurring
in
the
alimentary
canal
are
greatly
subject
to
influences
radiating
from
the
brain
it
is
especially
striking
that
both
the
movements
of
the
stomach
and
the
secretion
of
the
gastric
juice
may
be
inhibited
as
a
result
of
disturbing
circumstances
intestinal
movements
may
be
modified
in
similar
fashion
cannon
has
collected
various
instances
of
the
suspension
of
digestion
in
consequence
of
disagreeable
experiences
and
it
would
be
easy
for
almost
anyone
to
add
to
his
list
he
tells
us
for
example
of
the
case
of
a
woman
whose
stomach
was
emptied
under
the
direction
of
a
specialist
in
order
to
ascertain
the
degree
of
digestion
undergone
by
a
prescribed
breakfast
the
dinner
of
the
night
before
was
recovered
and
was
found
almost
unaltered
inquiry
led
to
the
fact
that
the
woman
had
passed
a
night
of
intense
agitation
as
the
result
of
misconduct
on
the
part
of
her
husband
people
who
are
seasick
some
hours
after
a
meal
vomit
undigested
food
apprehension
of
being
sick
has
probably
inhibited
the
gastric
activities
just
as
a
single
occasion
of
painful
emotion
may
lead
to
a
passing
digestive
disturbance
so
continued
mental
depression
worry
or
grief
may
permanently
impair
the
working
of
the
alimentary
tract
and
undermine
the
vigor
and
capacity
of
the
sufferer
homesickness
is
not
to
be
regarded
lightly
as
a
cause
of
malnutrition
companionship
is
a
powerful
promoter
of
assimilation
the
attractive
serving
of
food
a
pleasant
room
and
good
ventilation
are
of
high
importance
the
lack
of
these
so
commonly
faced
by
the
lonely
student
or
the
young
man
making
a
start
in
a
strange
city
may
be
to
some
extent
counteracted
by
the
cultivation
of
optimism
and
the
mental
discipline
which
makes
it
possible
to
detach
one
self
from
sordid
surroundings
almost
as
important
as
eating
is
drinking
for
liquids
constitute
the
largest
item
in
the
income
of
the
body
free
drinking
is
recommended
by
physiologists
the
beneficial
results
being
the
avoidance
of
constipation
and
the
promotion
of
the
elimination
of
dissolved
waste
by
the
kidneys
and
possibly
the
liver
in
regard
to
the
use
of
water
with
meals
a
point
upon
which
emphatic
cautions
were
formerly
offered
recent
experiments
have
failed
to
show
any
bad
effects
from
this
and
the
advice
is
now
given
to
drink
all
the
water
that
one
chooses
with
meals
caution
should
be
observed
however
about
introducing
hot
and
cold
liquids
into
the
stomach
in
quick
succession
other
liquids
have
been
much
discussed
by
dietitians
especially
tea
and
coffee
these
beverages
owe
what
limited
food
value
they
have
to
the
cream
and
sugar
usually
mixed
with
them
they
give
pleasure
by
their
aroma
but
they
are
given
a
peculiar
position
among
articles
of
diet
by
the
presence
in
them
of
the
compound
caffein
which
is
distinctly
a
drug
it
is
a
stimulant
to
the
heart
the
kidneys
and
the
central
nervous
system
individual
susceptibility
to
the
action
of
caffein
varies
greatly
where
one
person
notices
little
or
no
reaction
after
a
cup
of
coffee
another
is
exhilarated
to
a
marked
degree
and
hours
later
may
find
himself
lying
sleepless
with
tense
or
trembling
muscles
a
dry
burning
skin
and
a
mind
feverishly
active
often
it
is
found
that
a
more
protracted
disturbance
follows
the
taking
of
coffee
with
cream
than
is
caused
by
black
coffee
it
is
too
much
to
claim
that
the
use
of
tea
and
coffee
is
altogether
to
be
condemned
many
people
nevertheless
are
better
without
them
for
all
who
find
themselves
strongly
stimulated
it
is
the
part
of
wisdom
to
limit
the
enjoyment
of
these
decoctions
to
real
emergencies
when
uncommon
demands
are
made
upon
the
endurance
and
when
for
a
time
hygienic
considerations
have
to
be
ignored
if
young
people
will
postpone
the
formation
of
the
habit
they
will
have
one
more
resource
when
the
pressure
of
mature
life
becomes
severe
before
concluding
this
discussion
a
word
might
be
added
concerning
the
relation
between
fasting
and
mental
activity
prolonged
abstinence
from
food
frequently
results
in
highly
sharpened
intellectual
powers
numerous
examples
of
this
are
found
in
the
literature
of
history
and
biography
many
actors
speakers
and
singers
habitually
fast
before
public
performances
there
are
some
disadvantages
to
fasting
especially
loss
of
weight
and
weakness
but
when
done
under
the
direction
of
a
physician
fasting
has
been
known
to
produce
very
beneficial
effects
it
is
mentioned
here
because
it
has
such
marked
effects
in
speeding
up
the
mental
processes
and
clearing
the
mind
and
the
student
may
find
the
practice
a
source
of
mental
strength
during
times
of
stress
such
as
examinations
about
of
an
average
human
life
is
passed
in
the
familiar
and
yet
mysterious
state
which
we
call
sleep
from
one
point
of
view
this
seems
a
large
inroad
upon
the
period
in
which
our
consciousness
has
its
exercise
a
subtraction
of
years
from
the
life
of
one
who
lives
to
be
yet
we
know
that
the
efficiency
and
comfort
of
the
individual
demand
the
surrender
of
all
this
precious
time
it
has
often
been
said
that
sleep
is
a
more
imperative
necessity
than
food
and
the
claim
seems
to
be
well
founded
it
is
quite
likely
that
some
students
indulge
in
too
much
sleep
this
may
sometimes
be
due
to
laziness
but
frequently
it
is
due
to
actual
intoxication
from
an
excess
of
food
which
results
in
the
presence
of
poisonous
narcotizing
substances
absorbed
from
the
burdened
intestine
this
theory
is
rendered
tenable
by
the
fact
that
when
the
diet
is
reduced
the
hours
of
sleep
may
be
reduced
if
one
is
in
good
health
it
seems
right
to
expect
that
one
should
be
able
to
arise
gladly
and
briskly
upon
awaking
by
all
means
do
not
indulge
yourself
in
long
periods
of
lying
in
bed
after
a
good
night
rest
if
we
examine
the
physical
and
physiological
conditions
of
sleep
we
shall
better
understand
its
hygiene
sleep
is
a
state
in
which
the
tissues
of
the
body
which
have
been
used
up
may
be
restored
of
course
some
restoration
of
tissue
takes
place
as
soon
as
it
begins
to
wear
out
but
so
long
as
the
body
keeps
working
the
one
process
can
never
quite
compensate
for
the
other
so
there
must
be
a
periodic
cessation
of
activity
so
that
the
energies
of
the
body
may
be
devoted
to
restoration
viewing
sleep
as
a
time
when
bodily
cells
are
restored
we
see
that
we
tax
the
energies
of
the
body
less
if
we
go
to
sleep
each
day
before
the
cells
are
entirely
depleted
that
is
the
significance
of
the
old
teaching
that
sleep
before
midnight
is
more
efficacious
than
sleep
after
midnight
it
is
not
that
there
is
any
mystic
virtue
in
the
hours
before
twelve
but
that
in
the
early
part
of
the
evening
the
cells
are
not
so
nearly
exhausted
as
they
are
later
in
the
evening
and
it
is
much
easier
to
repair
them
in
the
partially
exhausted
stage
than
it
is
in
the
completely
exhausted
stage
for
this
reason
a
nap
is
often
effective
or
a
short
nap
after
the
evening
dinner
by
thus
catching
the
cells
at
an
early
stage
of
their
exhaustion
they
can
be
restored
with
comparative
ease
and
more
energy
will
be
available
for
use
during
the
remainder
of
the
working
hours
a
problem
that
may
occasionally
trouble
a
student
is
sleeplessness
and
we
may
properly
consider
here
some
of
the
ways
of
avoiding
it
one
prime
cause
of
sleeplessness
is
external
disturbance
the
disturbance
may
be
visual
although
it
is
ordinarily
thought
that
if
the
eyes
are
closed
no
visual
disturbances
can
be
sensed
nevertheless
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
are
not
wholly
opaque
sight
may
be
obtained
through
them
as
you
may
prove
by
closing
your
eyes
and
moving
your
fingers
before
them
the
lids
transmit
light
to
the
retina
and
it
is
quite
likely
that
you
are
frequently
awakened
by
a
beam
of
light
falling
upon
your
closed
for
this
reason
one
who
is
inclined
to
be
wakeful
should
shut
out
from
the
all
avenues
whereby
light
may
enter
as
a
distraction
the
temperature
sense
is
also
a
source
of
distraction
in
sleep
and
it
is
a
common
experience
to
be
awakened
by
extreme
cold
the
ears
too
may
be
the
source
of
disturbance
in
sleep
for
even
though
we
are
asleep
the
tympanic
membrane
is
always
exposed
to
vibrations
of
air
in
fact
stimuli
are
continually
playing
upon
the
and
are
arousing
nervous
currents
which
try
to
break
over
the
boundaries
of
sleep
and
impress
themselves
upon
the
brain
for
this
reason
one
who
wishes
to
have
untroubled
sleep
should
remove
all
possible
distractions
but
apart
from
external
distractions
wakefulness
may
still
be
caused
by
distractions
from
within
troublesome
ideas
may
be
present
and
persist
in
keeping
one
awake
this
means
that
brain
activity
has
been
started
and
needs
suppression
various
devices
have
been
suggested
one
is
to
eat
something
very
light
just
enough
to
draw
the
surplus
blood
which
excites
the
brain
away
from
the
brain
to
the
digestive
tract
this
advice
should
be
taken
with
caution
however
for
eating
just
before
retiring
may
use
up
in
digestion
much
of
the
energy
needed
in
repairing
the
body
and
may
leave
one
greatly
fatigued
in
the
morning
one
way
to
relieve
the
mind
of
mental
distractions
is
to
fill
it
with
restful
thoughts
read
something
light
a
restful
essay
or
a
story
or
poetry
another
device
is
to
bathe
the
head
in
cold
water
so
as
to
relieve
congestion
of
blood
in
the
brain
a
tepid
or
warm
bath
is
said
to
have
a
similar
effect
dreams
constitute
one
source
of
annoyance
to
many
and
while
they
are
not
necessarily
to
be
avoided
still
they
may
disturb
the
night
rest
we
may
avoid
them
in
some
measure
by
creating
conditions
free
from
sensory
distractions
for
many
of
our
dreams
are
direct
reflections
of
sensations
we
are
experiencing
at
the
moment
a
dream
with
an
arctic
setting
may
be
the
result
of
becoming
uncovered
on
a
cold
night
to
use
an
illustration
from
ellis
a
man
dreams
that
he
enlists
in
the
army
goes
to
the
front
and
is
shot
he
is
awakened
by
the
slamming
of
a
door
it
seems
probable
that
the
enlistment
and
the
march
to
the
field
are
theories
to
account
for
the
report
which
really
caused
the
whole
train
of
thought
though
it
seemed
to
be
its
latest
item
such
dreams
may
be
partially
eliminated
by
care
in
arranging
conditions
so
that
there
will
be
few
distractions
especially
should
they
be
guarded
against
in
the
later
hours
of
the
sleep
for
we
do
not
sleep
so
soundly
after
the
first
two
hours
as
we
do
before
and
stimuli
can
more
easily
impress
themselves
and
affect
the
brain
before
leaving
the
subject
of
sleep
we
should
note
the
benefit
to
be
derived
from
regularity
in
sleep
all
nature
seems
to
move
rhythmically
and
sleep
is
no
exception
insomnia
may
be
treated
by
means
of
habituating
one
self
to
get
sleepy
at
a
certain
time
and
there
is
no
question
that
the
rising
process
may
be
made
easier
if
one
forms
the
habit
of
arising
at
the
same
time
every
morning
to
rhythmize
this
important
function
is
a
long
step
towards
the
efficient
life
brain
workers
do
not
ordinarily
get
all
the
exercise
they
should
particularly
is
this
true
of
some
conscientious
students
who
feel
they
must
not
take
any
time
from
their
study
but
this
denotes
a
false
conception
of
mental
action
the
human
organism
needs
exercise
man
is
not
a
disembodied
spirit
he
must
pay
attention
to
the
claims
of
the
body
indeed
it
will
be
found
that
time
spent
in
exercise
will
result
in
a
higher
grade
of
mental
work
this
is
recognized
by
colleges
and
universities
by
the
requirement
of
gymnasium
work
and
the
opportunity
should
be
welcomed
by
the
student
inasmuch
as
institutions
generally
give
instruction
in
this
subject
we
need
not
go
specifically
into
the
matter
of

perhaps
the
only
caution
that
need
be
urged
is
that
against
the
excessive
participation
in
such
exhausting
games
as
it
is
seriously
to
be
questioned
whether
the
strenuous
grilling
that
a
player
must
undergo
does
not
actually
impair
his
ability
to
concentrate
upon
his
studies
if
you
undertake
a
course
of
exercise
by
all
means
have
it
regular
little
is
gained
by
sporadic
exercising
adopt
the
principle
of
regularity
and
rhythmize
this
important
phase
of
bodily
activity
as
well
as
all
other
phases
in
concluding
our
discussion
of
physical
hygiene
for
the
student
we
can
not
stress
too
much
the
value
of
relaxation
the
life
of
a
student
is
a
trying
one
it
exercises
chiefly
the
higher
brain
centres
and
keeps
the
organism
keyed
up
to
a
high
pitch
these
centres
become
fatigued
easily
and
ought
to
be
rested
occasionally
therefore
the
student
should
relax
at
intervals
and
engage
in
something
remote
from
study
to
forget
books
for
an
entire
is
often
wisdom
to
have
a
hobby
or
an
avocation
is
also
wise
a
student
must
not
forget
that
he
is
something
more
than
an
intellectual
being
he
is
a
physical
organism
and
a
social
being
and
the
life
demands
that
all
phases
receive
expression
we
grant
that
it
is
wrong
to
exalt
the
physical
and
stunt
the
mental
but
it
is
also
wrong
to
develop
the
intellectual
and
neglect
the
physical
we
must
recognize
with
browning
that
all
good
things
are
ours
