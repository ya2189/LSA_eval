the
french
this
volume
which
it
has
been
desired
to
make
known
to
the
great
public
in
the
french
language
in
entering
upon
a
question
so
complex
and
so
vast
as
socialism
has
but
a
single
and
definite
aim
my
intention
has
been
to
point
out
and
in
nearly
all
cases
by
rapid
and
concise
observations
the
general
relations
existing
between
contemporary
socialism
and
the
whole
trend
of
modern
scientific
thought
the
opponents
of
contemporary
socialism
see
in
it
or
wish
to
see
in
it
merely
a
reproduction
of
the
sentimental
socialism
of
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
they
contend
that
socialism
is
in
conflict
with
the
fundamental
facts
and
inductions
of
the
physical
biological
and
social
sciences
whose
marvelous
development
and
fruitful
applications
are
the
glory
of
our
dying
century
to
oppose
socialism
recourse
has
been
had
to
the
individual
interpretations
and
exaggerations
of
such
or
such
a
partisan
of
darwinism
or
to
the
opinions
of
such
or
such
a
sociologist
opinions
and
interpretations
in
obvious
conflict
with
the
premises
of
their
theories
on
universal
and
inevitable
evolution
it
has
also
been
said
under
the
pressure
of
acute
or
chronic
hunger
that
if
science
was
against
socialism
so
much
the
worse
for
science
and
those
who
thus
spoke
were
right
if
they
meant
by
science
even
with
a
capital
s
the
whole
mass
of
observations
and
conclusions
usum
that
orthodox
science
academic
and
official
often
in
good
faith
but
sometimes
also
through
interested
motives
has
always
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
ruling
minorities
i
have
believed
it
possible
to
show
that
modern
experiential
science
is
in
complete
harmony
with
contemporary
socialism
which
since
the
work
of
marx
and
engels
and
their
successors
differs
essentially
from
sentimental
socialism
both
in
its
scientific
system
and
in
its
political
tactics
though
it
continues
to
put
forth
generous
efforts
for
the
attainment
of
the
same
goal
social
justice
for
all
men
i
have
loyally
and
candidly
maintained
my
thesis
on
scientific
grounds
i
have
always
recognized
the
partial
truths
of
the
theories
of
our
opponents
and
i
have
not
ignored
the
glorious
achievements
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
bourgeois
science
since
the
outbreak
of
the
french
revolution
the
disappearance
of
the
bourgeois
class
and
science
which
at
their
advent
marked
the
disappearance
of
the
hieratic
and
aristocratic
classes
and
science
will
result
in
the
triumph
of
social
justice
for
all
mankind
without
distinction
of
classes
and
in
the
triumph
of
truth
carried
to
its
ultimate
consequences
the
appendix
contains
my
replies
to
a
letter
of
herbert
spencer
and
to
an
book
of
garofalo
it
shows
the
present
state
of
social
science
and
of
the
struggle
between
orthodoxy
which
is
blinded
to
the
sad
truths
of
contemporary
life
by
its
traditional
syllogisms
and
innovating
heterodoxy
which
is
ever
becoming
more
marked
among
the
learned
as
well
as
strengthening
its
hold
upon
the
collective
intelligence

introduction
convinced
darwinian
and
spencerian
as
i
am
it
is
my
intention
to
demonstrate
that
marxian
socialism
the
only
socialism
which
has
a
truly
scientific
method
and
value
and
therefore
the
only
socialism
which
from
this
time
forth
has
power
to
inspire
and
unite
the
social
democrats
throughout
the
civilized
world
is
only
the
practical
and
fruitful
fulfilment
in
the
social
life
of
that
modern
scientific
revolution
which
inaugurated
some
centuries
since
by
the
rebirth
of
the
experimental
method
in
all
branches
of
human
knowledge
has
triumphed
in
our
times
thanks
to
the
works
of
charles
darwin
and
herbert
spencer
it
is
true
that
darwin
and
especially
spencer
halted
when
they
had
travelled
only
half
way
toward
the
conclusions
of
a
religious
political
or
social
order
which
necessarily
flow
from
their
indisputable
premises
but
that
is
as
it
were
only
an
individual
episode
and
has
no
power
to
stop
the
destined
march
of
science
and
of
its
practical
consequences
which
are
in
wonderful
accord
with
the
necessities
necessities
enforced
upon
our
attention
by
want
and
misery
of
contemporary
life
this
is
simply
one
more
reason
why
it
is
incumbent
upon
us
to
render
justice
to
the
scientific
and
political
work
of
karl
marx
which
completes
the
renovation
of
modern
scientific
thought
feeling
and
thought
are
the
two
inseparable
impelling
forces
of
the
individual
life
and
of
the
collective
life
socialism
which
was
still
but
a
few
years
since
at
the
mercy
of
the
strong
and
constantly
recurring
but
undisciplined
fluctuations
of
humanitarian
sentimentalism
has
found
in
the
work
of
that
great
man
karl
marx
and
of
those
who
have
developed
and
completed
his
thought
its
scientific
and
political
guide
this
is
the
explanation
of
every
one
of
its
conquests
civilization
is
the
most
fruitful
and
most
beautiful
development
of
human
energies
but
it
contains
also
an
infectious
of
tremendous
power
beside
the
splendor
of
its
artistic
scientific
and
industrial
achievements
it
accumulates
gangrenous
products
idleness
poverty
misery
insanity
crime
and
physical
suicide
and
moral
suicide
servility
pessimism
that
sad
symptom
of
a
life
without
ideals
and
in
part
the
effect
of
the
exhaustion
or
even
of
the
degeneration
of
the
nervous
system
glorifies
the
final
annihilation
of
all
life
and
sensation
as
the
only
mode
of
escaping
from
or
triumphing
over
pain
and
suffering
we
have
faith
on
the
contrary
in
the
eternal
medicatrix
healing
power
of
nature
and
socialism
is
precisely
that
breath
of
a
new
and
better
life
which
will
free
humanity
after
some
access
of
fever
perhaps
from
the
noxious
products
of
the
present
phase
of
civilization
and
which
in
a
more
advanced
phase
will
give
a
new
power
and
opportunity
of
expansion
to
all
the
healthy
and
fruitful
energies
of
all
human
beings

the
celebrated

delivered
at
the
congress
of
naturalists
which
was
held
at
munich
an
eloquent
address
defending
and
propagating
darwinism
which
was
at
that
time
the
object
of
the
most
bitter
polemical
attacks
a
few
days
afterward
virchow
the
great
pathologist
an
active
member
of
the
progressive
parliamentary
party
hating
new
theories
in
politics
just
as
much
as
in
science
violently
assailed
the
darwinian
theory
of
organic
evolution
and
moved
by
a
very
just
presentiment
hurled
against
it
this
cry
of
alarm
this
political
anathema
darwinism
leads
directly
to
socialism
the
german
darwinians
and
at
their
head
oscar
schmidt
and
haeckel
immediately
protested
and
in
order
to
avert
the
addition
of
strong
political
opposition
to
the
religious
philosophical
and
biological
opposition
already
made
to
darwinism
they
maintained
on
the
contrary
that
the
darwinian
theory
is
in
direct
open
and
absolute
opposition
to
socialism
if
the
socialists
were
prudent
wrote
oscar
schmidt
in
the
ausland
of
november
they
would
do
their
utmost
to
kill
by
silent
neglect
the
theory
of
descent
for
that
theory
most
emphatically
proclaims
that
the
socialist
ideas
are
impracticable
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
haeckel
there
is
no
scientific
doctrine
which
proclaims
more
openly
than
the
theory
of
descent
that
the
equality
of
individuals
toward
which
socialism
tends
is
an
impossibility
that
this
chimerical
equality
is
in
absolute
contradiction
with
the
necessary
and
in
fact
universal
inequality
of
individuals
socialism
demands
for
all
citizens
equal
rights
equal
duties
equal
possessions
and
equal
enjoyments
the
theory
of
descent
establishes
on
the
contrary
that
the
realization
of
these
hopes
is
purely
and
simply
impossible
that
in
human
societies
as
in
animal
societies
neither
the
rights
nor
the
duties
nor
the
possessions
nor
the
enjoyments
of
all
the
members
of
a
society
are
or
ever
can
be
equal
the
great
law
of
variation
teaches
both
in
the
general
theory
of
evolution
and
in
the
smaller
field
of
biology
where
it
becomes
the
theory
of
descent
that
the
variety
of
phenomena
flows
from
an
original
unity
the
diversity
of
functions
from
a
primitive
identity
and
the
complexity
of
organization
from
a
primordial
simplicity
the
conditions
of
existence
for
all
individuals
are
from
their
very
birth
unequal
there
must
also
be
taken
into
consideration
the
inherited
qualities
and
the
innate
tendencies
which
also
vary
more
or
less
widely
in
view
of
all
this
how
can
the
work
and
the
reward
be
equal
for
all
the
more
highly
the
social
life
is
developed
the
more
important
becomes
the
great
principle
of
the
division
of
labor
the
more
requisite
it
becomes
for
the
stable
existence
of
the
state
as
a
whole
that
its
members
should
distribute
among
themselves
the
multifarious
tasks
of
life
each
performing
a
single
function
and
as
the
labor
which
must
be
performed
by
the
individuals
as
well
as
the
expenditure
of
strength
talent
money
which
it
necessitates
differs
more
and
more
it
is
natural
that
the
remuneration
of
this
labor
should
also
vary
widely
these
are
facts
so
simple
and
so
obvious
that
it
seems
to
me
every
intelligent
and
enlightened
statesman
ought
to
be
an
advocate
of
the
theory
of
descent
and
the
general
doctrine
of
evolution
as
the
best
antidote
for
the
absurd
equalitarian
utopian
notions
of
the
socialists
and
it
was
darwinism
the
theory
of
selection
that
virchow
in
his
denunciation
had
in
mind
rather
than
mere
metamorphic
development
the
theory
of
descent
with
which
it
is
always
confused
darwinism
is
anything
rather
than
socialistic
if
one
wishes
to
attribute
a
political
tendency
to
this
english
theory
which
is
quite
permissible
this
tendency
can
be
nothing
but
aristocratic
by
no
means
can
it
be
democratic
still
less
socialistic
the
theory
of
selection
teaches
that
in
the
life
of
mankind
as
in
that
of
plants
and
animals
it
is
always
and
everywhere
a
small
privileged
minority
alone
which
succeeds
in
living
and
developing
itself
the
immense
majority
on
the
contrary
suffer
and
succumb
more
or
less
prematurely
countless
are
the
seeds
and
eggs
of
every
species
of
plants
and
animals
and
the
young
individuals
who
issue
from
them
but
the
number
of
those
who
have
the
good
fortune
to
reach
fully
developed
maturity
and
to
attain
the
goal
of
their
existence
is
relatively
insignificant
the
cruel
and
pitiless
for
existence
which
rages
everywhere
throughout
animated
nature
and
which
in
the
nature
of
things
must
rage
this
eternal
and
inexorable
competition
between
all
living
beings
is
an
undeniable
fact
only
a
small
picked
number
of
the
strongest
or
fittest
is
able
to
come
forth
victoriously
from
this
battle
of
competition
the
great
majority
of
their
unfortunate
competitors
are
inevitably
destined
to
perish
it
is
well
enough
to
deplore
this
tragic
fatality
but
one
can
not
deny
it
or
change
it
are
called
but
few
are
chosen
the
selection
the
of
these
is
by
absolute
necessity
bound
up
with
the
rejection
or
destruction
of
the
vast
multitude
of
beings
whom
they
have
survived
and
so
another
learned
englishman
has
called
the
fundamental
principle
of
darwinism
survival
of
the
fittest
the
victory
of
the
best
at
all
events
the
principle
of
selection
is
not
in
the
slightest
degree
democratic
it
is
on
the
contrary
thoroughly
aristocratic
if
then
darwinism
carried
out
to
its
ultimate
logical
consequences
has
according
to
virchow
for
the
statesman
extraordinarily
dangerous
side
the
danger
is
doubtless
that
it
favors
aristocratic
aspirations
i
have
reproduced
complete
and
in
their
exact
form
all
the
arguments
of
haeckel
because
they
are
those
which
are
repeated
in
varying
tones
and
with
expressions
which
differ
from
his
only
to
lose
precision
and
eloquence
by
those
opponents
of
socialism
who
love
to
appear
scientific
and
who
for
polemical
convenience
make
use
of
those
or
stereotyped
phrases
which
have
currency
even
in
science
more
than
is
commonly
imagined
it
is
easy
nevertheless
to
demonstrate
that
in
this
debate
way
of
looking
at
the
subject
was
the
more
correct
and
more
perspicacious
and
that
the
history
of
these
last
twenty
years
has
amply
justified
his
position
it
has
happened
indeed
that
darwinism
and
socialism
have
both
progressed
with
a
marvelous
power
of
expansion
from
that
time
the
one
was
to
conquer
for
its
fundamental
theory
the
unanimous
endorsement
of
naturalists
the
other
was
to
continue
to
develop
in
its
general
aspirations
as
in
its
political
discipline
flooding
all
the
conduits
of
the
social
consciousness
like
a
torrential
inundation
from
internal
wounds
caused
by
the
daily
growth
of
physical
and
moral
disease
or
like
a
gradual
capillary
inevitable
infiltration
into
minds
freed
from
all
prejudices
and
which
are
not
satisfied
by
the
merely
personal
advantages
that
they
derive
from
the
orthodox
distribution
of
spoils
but
as
political
or
scientific
theories
are
natural
phenomena
and
not
the
capricious
and
ephemeral
products
of
the
free
wills
of
those
who
construct
and
propagate
them
it
is
evident
that
if
these
two
currents
of
modern
thought
have
each
been
able
to
triumph
over
the
opposition
they
first
aroused
the
strongest
kind
of
opposition
scientific
and
political
conservatism
and
if
every
day
increases
the
army
of
their
avowed
disciples
this
of
itself
is
enough
to
show
us
i
was
about
to
say
by
a
law
of
intellectual
that
they
are
neither
irreconcilable
with
nor
contradictory
to
each
other
moreover
the
three
principal
arguments
which
form
the
substance
of
the
reasoning
of
haeckel
resist
neither
the
most
elementary
criticisms
nor
the
most
superficial
observation
of
life
these
arguments
are
socialism
tends
toward
a
chimerical
equality
of
persons
and
property
darwinism
on
the
contrary
not
only
establishes
but
shows
the
organic
necessity
of
the
natural
inequality
of
the
capabilities
and
even
the
wants
of
individuals
in
the
life
of
mankind
as
in
that
of
plants
and
animals
the
immense
majority
of
those
who
are
born
are
destined
to
perish
because
only
a
small
minority
can
triumph
in
the
struggle
for
existence
socialism
asserts
on
the
contrary
that
all
ought
to
triumph
in
this
struggle
and
that
no
one
is
inexorably
destined
to
be
conquered
the
struggle
for
existence
assures
the
survival
of
the
best
the
victory
of
the
fittest
and
this
results
in
an
aristocratic
hierarchic
gradation
of
selected
individuals
a
continuous
progress
instead
of
the
democratic
collectivist
leveling
of
socialism

the
equality
of
individuals
the
first
of
the
objections
which
is
brought
against
socialism
in
the
name
of
darwinism
is
absolutely
without
foundation
if
it
were
true
that
socialism
aspires
to
the
equality
of
all
individuals
it
would
be
correct
to
assert
that
darwinism
irrevocably
condemns
it
but
although
even
it
is
still
currently
repeated
by
some
in
good
faith
like
parrots
who
recite
their
stereotyped
phrases
by
others
in
bad
faith
with
polemical
skillfulness
that
socialism
is
synonymous
with
equality
and
leveling
the
truth
is
on
the
contrary
that
scientific
socialism
the
socialism
which
draws
its
inspiration
from
the
theory
of
marx
and
which
alone
is
worthy
of
support
or
opposition
has
never
denied
the
inequality
of
individuals
as
of
all
living
beings
inequality
innate
and
acquired
physical
and
intellectual
it
is
just
as
if
one
should
say
that
socialism
asserts
that
a
royal
decree
or
a
popular
vote
could
settle
it
that
henceforth
all
men
shall
be
five
feet
seven
inches
tall
but
in
truth
socialism
is
something
more
serious
and
more
difficult
to
refute
socialism
says
are
unequal
but
they
are
of
them
and
in
fact
although
each
individual
is
born
and
develops
in
a
fashion
more
or
less
different
from
that
of
all
other
individuals
just
as
there
are
not
in
a
forest
two
leaves
identically
alike
so
in
the
whole
world
there
are
not
two
men
in
all
respects
equals
the
one
of
the
other
nevertheless
every
man
simply
because
he
is
a
has
a
right
to
the
existence
of
a
man
and
not
of
a
slave
or
a
beast
of
burden
we
know
we
as
well
as
our
opponents
that
all
men
can
not
perform
the
same
kind
and
amount
of
labor
now
when
social
inequalities
are
added
to
equalities
of
natural
origin
and
that
they
will
still
be
unable
to
do
it
under
a
socialist
regime
when
the
social
organization
will
tend
to
reduce
the
effect
of
congenital
inequalities
there
will
always
be
some
people
whose
brains
or
muscular
systems
will
be
better
adapted
for
scientific
work
or
for
artistic
work
while
others
will
be
more
fit
for
manual
labor
or
for
work
requiring
mechanical
precision
etc
what
ought
not
to
be
and
what
will
not
be
is
that
there
should
be
some
men
who
do
not
work
at
all
and
others
who
work
too
much
or
receive
too
little
reward
for
their
toil
but
we
have
reached
the
height
of
injustice
and
absurdity
and
in
these
days
it
is
the
man
who
does
not
work
who
reaps
the
largest
returns
who
is
thus
guaranteed
the
individual
monopoly
of
wealth
which
accumulates
by
means
of
hereditary
transmission
this
wealth
moreover
is
only
very
rarely
due
to
the
economy
and
abstinence
of
the
present
possessor
or
of
some
industrious
ancestor
of
his
it
is
most
frequently
the
fruit
of
spoliation
by
military
conquest
by
unscrupulous
business
methods
or
by
the
favoritism
of
sovereigns
but
it
is
in
every
instance
always
independent
of
any
exertion
of
any
socially
useful
labor
of
the
inheritor
who
often
squanders
his
property
in
idleness
or
in
the
whirlpool
of
a
life
as
inane
as
it
is
brilliant
in
appearance
and
when
we
are
not
confronted
with
a
fortune
due
to
inheritance
we
meet
with
wealth
due
to
fraud
without
talking
for
the
moment
of
the
economic
organization
the
mechanism
of
which
karl
marx
has
revealed
to
us
and
which
even
without
fraud
normally
enables
the
capitalist
or
property
owner
to
live
upon
his
income
without
working
it
is
indisputable
that
the
fortunes
which
are
formed
or
enlarged
with
the
greatest
rapidity
under
our
eyes
can
not
be
the
fruit
of
honest
toil
the
really
honest
workingman
no
matter
how
indefatigable
and
economical
he
may
be
if
he
succeeds
in
raising
himself
from
the
state
of
to
that
of
an
overseer
or
contractor
can
by
a
long
life
of
privations
accumulate
at
most
a
few
hundreds
of
dollars
those
who
on
the
contrary
without
making
by
their
own
talent
industrial
discoveries
or
inventions
accumulate
in
a
few
years
millions
can
be
nothing
but
unscrupulous
manipulators
of
affairs
if
we
except
a
few
rare
strokes
of
good
luck
and
it
is
these
very
parasites
bankers
who
live
in
the
most
ostentatious
luxury
enjoying
public
honors
and
holding
offices
of
trust
as
a
reward
for
their
honorable
business
methods
those
who
toil
the
immense
majority
receive
barely
enough
food
to
keep
them
from
dying
of
hunger
they
live
in
in
garrets
in
the
filthy
alleys
of
cities
or
in
the
country
in
hovels
not
fit
for
stables
for
horses
or
cattle
besides
all
this
we
must
not
forget
the
horrors
of
being
unable
to
find
work
the
saddest
and
most
frequent
of
the
three
symptoms
of
that
in
which
is
spreading
like
a
pestilence
over
the
economic
world
of
modern
italy
as
indeed
with
varying
degrees
of
intensity
it
is
everywhere
else
i
refer
to
the
army
of
the
in
agriculture
and
industry
of
those
who
have
lost
their
foothold
in
the
lower
middle
class
and
of
those
who
have
been
robbed
of
their
little
possessions
by
taxes
debts
or
usury
it
is
not
correct
then
to
assert
that
socialism
demands
for
all
citizens
material
and
actual
equality
of
labor
and
rewards
the
only
possible
equality
is
equality
of
obligation
to
work
in
order
to
live
with
a
guarantee
to
every
laborer
of
conditions
of
existence
worthy
of
a
human
being
in
exchange
for
the
labor
furnished
to
society
equality
according
to
socialism
as
benoit
malon
said
is
a
relative
thing
and
must
be
understood
in
a
sense
all
men
as
men
must
be
guaranteed
human
conditions
of
existence
all
men
ought
to
be
equal
the
starting
ought
not
to
be
handicapped
in
the
struggle
for
life
in
order
that
each
may
freely
develop
his
own
personality
in
an
environment
of
equality
of
conditions
while
a
child
sound
and
healthy
but
poor
goes
to
the
wall
in
competition
with
a
child
puny
but
rich
this
is
what
constitutes
the
radical
immeasurable
transformation
that
socialism
demands
but
that
it
also
has
discovered
and
announces
as
an
evolution
already
begun
in
the
world
around
us
that
will
be
necessarily
inevitably
accomplished
in
the
human
society
of
the
days
to
come
this
transformation
is
summed
up
in
the
conversion
of
private
or
individual
ownership
of
the
means
of
production
of
the
physical
foundation
of
human
life
land
mines
houses
factories
machinery
instruments
of
labor
or
tools
and
means
of
transportation
into
collective
or
social
ownership
by
means
of
methods
and
processes
which
i
will
consider
further
on
from
this
point
we
will
consider
it
as
proven
that
the
first
objection
of
the
reasoning
does
not
hold
since
its
is
it
assumes
in
short
that
contemporary
socialism
aims
at
a
chimerical
physical
and
mental
equality
of
all
men
when
the
fact
is
that
scientific
and
socialism
never
even
in
a
dream
thought
of
such
a
thing
socialism
maintains
on
the
contrary
that
this
inequality
though
greatly
diminished
under
a
better
social
organization
which
will
do
away
with
all
the
physical
and
mental
imperfections
that
are
the
cumulative
results
of
generations
of
poverty
and
misery
can
nevertheless
never
disappear
for
the
reasons
that
darwinism
has
discovered
in
the
mysterious
mechanism
of
life
in
other
words
on
account
of
the
principle
of
variation
that
manifests
itself
in
the
continuous
development
of
species
culminating
in
man
in
every
social
organization
that
it
is
possible
to
conceive
there
will
always
be
some
men
large
and
others
small
some
weak
and
some
strong
some
phlegmatic
and
some
nervous
some
more
intelligent
others
less
so
some
superior
in
mental
power
others
in
muscular
strength
and
it
is
well
that
it
should
be
so
moreover
it
is
inevitable
it
is
well
that
this
is
so
because
the
variety
and
inequality
of
individual
aptitudes
naturally
produce
that
division
of
labor
that
darwinism
has
rightly
declared
to
be
a
law
of
individual
physiology
and
of
social
economy
all
men
ought
to
work
in
order
to
live
but
each
ought
to
devote
himself
to
the
kind
of
labor
which
best
suits
his
peculiar
aptitudes
an
injurious
waste
of
strength
and
abilities
would
thus
be
avoided
and
labor
would
cease
to
be
repugnant
and
would
become
agreeable
and
necessary
as
a
condition
of
physical
and
moral
health
and
when
all
have
given
to
society
the
labor
best
suited
to
their
innate
and
acquired
aptitudes
each
has
a
right
to
the
same
rewards
since
each
has
equally
contributed
to
that
solidarity
of
labor
which
sustains
the
life
of
the
social
aggregate
and
in
solidarity
with
it
the
life
of
each
individual
the
peasant
who
digs
the
earth
performs
a
kind
of
labor
in
appearance
more
modest
but
just
as
necessary
useful
and
meritorious
as
that
of
the
workman
who
builds
a
locomotive
of
the
mechanical
engineer
who
improves
it
or
of
the
savant
who
strives
to
extend
the
bounds
of
human
knowledge
in
his
study
or
laboratory
the
one
essential
thing
is
that
all
the
members
of
society
work
just
as
in
the
individual
organism
all
the
cells
perform
their
different
functions
more
or
less
modest
in
appearance
for
example
the
the
or
the
muscular
cells
but
all
biological
functions
or
sorts
of
labor
equally
useful
and
necessary
to
the
life
of
the
organism
as
a
whole
in
the
biological
organism
no
living
cell
remains
inactive
and
the
cell
obtains
nourishment
by
material
exchanges
only
in
proportion
to
its
labor
in
the
social
organism
no
individual
ought
to
live
without
working
whatever
form
his
labor
may
take
in
this
way
the
majority
of
the
artificial
difficulties
that
our
opponents
raise
against
socialism
may
be
swept
aside
who
then
will
black
the
boots
under
the
socialist
regime
demands
richter
in
his
book
so
poor
in
ideas
but
which
becomes
positively
grotesque
when
it
assumes
that
in
the
name
of
social
equality
the
grand
chancellor
of
the
socialist
society
will
be
obliged
before
attending
to
the
public
business
to
black
his
own
boots
and
mind
his
own
clothes
in
truth
if
the
adversaries
of
socialism
had
nothing
but
arguments
of
this
sort
discussion
would
indeed
be
needless
but
all
will
want
to
do
the
least
fatiguing
and
most
agreeable
kinds
of
work
says
some
one
with
a
greater
show
of
seriousness
i
will
answer
that
this
is
equivalent
to
demanding
the
promulgation
of
a
decree
as
follows
henceforth
all
men
shall
be
born
painters
or
surgeons
the
distribution
to
the
proper
persons
of
the
different
kinds
of
mental
and
manual
labor
will
be
effected
in
fact
by
the
anthropological
variations
in
temperament
and
character
and
there
will
be
no
need
to
resort
to
monkish
regulations
another
baseless
objection
to
socialism
propose
to
a
peasant
of
average
intelligence
to
devote
himself
to
the
study
of
anatomy
or
of
the
penal
code
or
inversely
tell
him
whose
brain
is
more
highly
developed
than
his
muscles
to
dig
the
earth
instead
of
observing
with
the
microscope
they
will
each
prefer
the
labor
for
which
they
feel
themselves
best
fitted
the
changes
of
occupation
or
profession
will
not
be
as
considerable
as
many
imagine
when
society
shall
be
organized
under
the
collectivist
regime
when
once
the
industries
ministering
to
purely
luxury
shall
be
suppressed
luxury
which
in
most
cases
insults
and
aggravates
the
misery
of
the
masses
the
quantity
and
variety
of
work
will
adapt
themselves
gradually
that
is
to
say
naturally
to
the
socialist
phase
of
civilization
just
as
they
now
conform
to
the
bourgeois
phase
moreover
under
the
socialist
regime
every
one
will
have
the
fullest
liberty
to
declare
and
make
manifest
his
personal
aptitudes
and
it
will
not
happen
as
it
does
that
many
peasants
sons
of
the
people
and
of
the
lower
middle
class
gifted
with
natural
talents
will
be
compelled
to
allow
their
talents
to
atrophy
while
they
toil
as
peasants
workingmen
or
employees
when
they
would
be
able
to
furnish
society
a
different
and
more
fruitful
kind
of
labor
because
it
would
be
more
in
harmony
with
their
peculiar
genius
the
one
essential
point
is
this
in
exchange
for
the
labor
that
they
furnish
to
society
society
must
guarantee
to
the
peasant
and
the
artisan
as
well
as
to
the
one
who
devotes
himself
to
the
liberal
careers
conditions
of
existence
worthy
of
a
human
being
then
we
will
no
longer
be
affronted
by
the
spectacle
of
a
ballet
girl
for
instance
earning
as
much
in
one
evening
by
whirling
on
her
toes
as
a
scientist
a
doctor
a
lawyer
in
a
year
work
in
fact
the
latter
are
in
luck
if
they
do
that
well
certainly
the
arts
will
not
be
neglected
under
the
socialist
regime
because
socialism
wishes
life
to
be
agreeable
for
all
instead
of
for
a
privileged
few
only
as
it
is
it
will
on
the
contrary
give
to
all
the
arts
a
marvelous
impulse
and
if
it
abolishes
private
luxury
this
will
be
all
the
more
favorable
to
the
splendor
of
the
public
edifices
more
attention
will
be
paid
to
assuring
to
each
one
remuneration
in
proportion
to
the
labor
performed
this
ratio
will
be
ascertained
by
taking
the
difficulty
and
danger
of
the
labor
into
account
and
allowing
them
to
reduce
the
time
required
for
a
given
compensation
if
a
peasant
in
the
open
air
can
work
seven
or
eight
hours
a
day
a
miner
ought
not
to
work
more
than
three
or
four
hours
and
indeed
when
everybody
shall
work
when
much
unproductive
labor
shall
be
suppressed
the
aggregate
of
daily
labor
to
be
distributed
among
men
will
be
much
less
heavy
and
more
easily
endured
by
reason
of
the
more
abundant
food
more
comfortable
lodging
and
recreation
guaranteed
to
every
worker
than
it
is
by
those
who
toil
and
who
are
so
poorly
paid
and
besides
this
the
progress
of
science
applied
to
industry
will
render
human
labor
less
and
less
toilsome
individuals
will
apply
themselves
to
work
although
the
wages
or
remuneration
can
not
be
accumulated
as
private
wealth
because
if
the
normal
healthy
man
avoids
excessive
or
poorly
rewarded
labor
he
does
not
remain
in
idleness
since
it
is
a
physiological
and
psychological
necessity
for
him
to
devote
himself
to
a
daily
occupation
in
harmony
with
his
capacities
the
different
kinds
of
sport
are
for
the
leisure
classes
a
substitute
for
productive
labor
which
a
physiological
necessity
imposes
upon
them
in
order
that
they
may
escape
the
detrimental
consequences
of
absolute
repose
and
ennui
the
gravest
problem
will
be
to
the
remuneration
to
the
labor
of
each
you
know
that
collectivism
adopts
the
formula
to
each
according
to
his
labor
while
communism
adopts
this
other
to
each
according
to
his
needs
no
one
can
give
in
practical
the
solution
of
this
problem
but
this
impossibility
of
predicting
the
future
even
in
its
slightest
details
does
not
justify
those
who
brand
socialism
as
a
utopia
incapable
of
realization
no
one
could
have
in
the
dawn
of
any
civilization
predicted
its
successive
developments
as
i
will
demonstrate
when
i
come
to
speak
of
the
methods
of
social
renovation
this
is
what
we
are
able
to
affirm
with
assurance
basing
our
position
on
the
most
certain
inductions
of
psychology
and
sociology
it
can
not
be
denied
as
marx
himself
declared
that
this
second
formula
which
makes
it
possible
to
distinguish
according
to
some
anarchy
from
socialism
represents
a
more
remote
and
more
complex
ideal
but
it
is
equally
impossible
to
deny
that
in
any
case
the
formula
of
collectivism
represents
a
phase
of
social
evolution
a
period
of
individual
discipline
which
must
necessarily
precede
communism
there
is
no
need
to
believe
that
socialism
will
realize
in
their
fulness
all
the
highest
possible
ideals
of
humanity
and
that
after
its
advent
there
will
be
nothing
left
to
desire
or
to
battle
for
our
descendants
would
be
condemned
to
idleness
and
vagabondage
if
our
immediate
ideal
was
so
perfect
and
as
to
leave
them
no
ideal
at
which
to
aim
the
individual
or
the
society
which
no
longer
has
an
ideal
to
strive
toward
is
dead
or
about
to
die
the
formula
of
communism
may
then
be
a
more
remote
ideal
when
collectivism
shall
have
been
completely
realized
by
the
historical
processes
which
i
will
consider
further
on
we
are
now
in
a
position
to
conclude
that
there
is
no
contradiction
between
socialism
and
darwinism
on
the
subject
of
the
equality
of
all
men
socialism
has
never
laid
down
this
proposition
and
like
darwinism
its
tendency
is
toward
a
better
life
for
individuals
and
for
society
this
enables
us
also
to
reply
to
this
objection
too
often
repeated
that
socialism
stifles
and
suppresses
human
individuality
under
the
leaden
pall
of
collectivism
by
subjecting
individuals
to
uniform
monastic
regulations
and
by
making
them
into
so
many
human
bees
in
the
social
exactly
the
opposite
of
this
is
true
is
it
not
obvious
that
it
is
under
the
present
bourgeois
organization
of
society
that
so
many
individualities
atrophy
and
are
lost
to
humanity
which
under
other
conditions
might
be
developed
to
their
own
advantage
and
to
the
advantage
of
society
as
a
whole
in
fact
apart
from
some
rare
exceptions
every
man
is
valued
for
what
he
and
not
for
what

pointed

that
all
the
characteristics
of

are
the
consequences
of
her
great
biological
function
maternity
a
being
who
creates
another
being
not
in
the
fleeting
moment
of
a
voluptuous
contact
but
by
the
organic
and
psychical
sacrifices
of

childbirth
and
giving

can
not
preserve

herself

much
strength
physical
and

as

whose
only
function
in
the
reproduction
of
the
species
is
infinitely
less
of
a
drain
and
so
aside
from
certain
individual
exceptions
woman
has
a
lower
degree
of
physical
sensibility
than
man
the
current
opinion
is
just
the
opposite
because
if
her
sensibility
were
greater
she
could
not
according
to
the
darwinian
law
survive
the
immense
and
repeated
sacrifices
of
maternity
and
the
species
would
become
extinct
intellect
is
weaker
especially
in

power
precisely
because
though
there
are
no
sergi
in
della

di
women
of
genius
they
nevertheless
give
birth
to
men
of
genius
this
is
so
true
that
greater
sensibility
and
power
of
intellect
are
found
in
women
in
whom
the
function
and
sentiment
of
maternity
are
undeveloped
or
are
only
slightly
developed
women
of
genius
generally
have
a
masculine
physiognomy
and
many
of
them
attain
their
complete
intellectual
development
only
after
they
pass
the
critical
period
of
life
during
which
the
maternal
functions
cease
finally
but
if
it
is
scientifically
certain
that
woman
represents
an
inferior
degree
of
biological
evolution
and
that
she
occupies
a
station
even
as
regards
her
characteristics
midway
between
the
child
and
the
adult
male
it
does
not
follow
from
this
that
the
socialist
conclusions
concerning
the
woman
question
are
false
quite
the
contrary
society
ought
to
place
woman
as
a
human
being
and
as
a
creatress
of
men
more
worthy
therefore
of
love
and
respect
in
a
better
juridical
and
ethical
situation
than
she
enjoys
at
present
now
she
is
too
often
a
beast
of
burden
or
an
object
of
luxury
in
the
same
way
when
from
the
economic
point
of
view
we
demand
at
the
present
day
special
measures
in

of
women
we
simply
take
into
consideration
their
special
conditions
the
present
economic
individualism
exhausts
them
in
factories
and
socialism
on
the
contrary
will
require
from
them
only
such
professional

is

the
struggle
for
life
and
its
victims
socialism
and
darwinism
it
is
said
are
in
conflict
on
a
second
point
darwinism
demonstrates
that
the
immense
majority
of
plants
animals
and
men
are
destined
to
succumb
because
only
a
small
minority
triumphs
in
the
struggle
for
life
socialism
on
its
part
asserts
that
all
ought
to
triumph
and
that
no
one
ought
to
succumb
it
may
be
replied
in
the
first
place
that
even
in
the
biological
domain
of
the
struggle
for
existence
the
disproportion
between
the
number
of
individuals
who
are
born
and
the
number
of
those
who
survive
regularly
and
progressively
grows
smaller
and
smaller
as
we
ascend
in
the
biological
scale
from
vegetables
to
animals
and
from
animals
to
man
this
law
of
a
decreasing
disproportion
between
the
called
and
the
chosen
is
supported
by
the
facts
even
if
we
limit
our
observation
to
the
various
species
belonging
to
the
same
natural
order
the
higher
and
more
complex
the
organization
the
smaller
the
disproportion
in
fact
in
the
vegetables
each
individual
produces
every
year
an
infinite
number
of
seeds
and
an
infinitesimal
number
of
these
survive
in
the
animals
the
number
of
young
of
each
individual
diminishes
and
the
number
of
those
who
survive
continues
on
the
contrary
to
increase
finally
for
the
human
species
the
number
of
individuals
that
each
one
can
beget
is
very
small
and
most
of
them
survive
but
moreover
in
the
cases
of
all
three
vegetables
animals
and
men
we
find
that
it
is
the
lower
and
more
simply
organized
species
the
races
and
classes
less
advanced
in
the
scale
of
existence
who
reproduce
their
several
kinds
with
the
greatest
prolificness
and
in
which
generation
follows
generation
most
rapidly
on
account
of
the
brevity
of
individual
life
a
fern
produces
millions
of
spores
and
its
life
is
very
short
while
a
palm
tree
produces
only
a
few
dozen
seeds
and
lives
a
century
a
fish
produces
several
thousand
eggs
while
the
elephant
or
the
chimpanzee
have
only
a
few
young
who
live
many
years
within
the
human
species
the
savage
races
are
the
most
prolific
and
their
lives
are
short
while
the
civilized
races
have
a
low
and
live
longer
from
all
this
it
follows
that
even
confining
ourselves
to
the
purely
biological
domain
the
number
of
victors
in
the
struggle
for
existence
constantly
tends
to
approach
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
number
of
births
with
the
advance
or
ascent
in
the
biological
scale
from
vegetables
to
animals
from
animals
to
men
and
from
the
lower
species
or
varieties
to
the
higher
species
or
varieties
the
iron
law
of
the
struggle
for
existence
then
constantly
reduces
the
number
of
the
victims
forming
its
hecatomb
with
the
ascent
of
the
biological
scale
and
the
rate
of
decrease
becomes
more
and
more
rapid
as
the
forms
of
life
become
more
complex
and
more
perfect
it
would
then
be
a
mistake
to
invoke
against
socialism
the
darwinian
law
of
natural
selection
in
the
form
under
which
that
law
manifests
itself
in
the
primitive
or
lower
forms
of
life
without
taking
into
account
its
continuous
attenuation
as
we
pass
from
vegetables
to
animals
from
animals
to
men
and
within
humanity
itself
from
the
primitive
races
to
the
more
advanced
races
and
as
socialism
represents
a
yet
more
advanced
phase
of
human
progress
it
is
still
less
allowable
to
use
as
an
objection
to
it
such
a
gross
and
inaccurate
interpretation
of
the
darwinian
law
it
is
certain
that
the
opponents
of
socialism
have
made
a
wrong
use
of
the
darwinian
law
or
rather
of
its
brutal
interpretation
in
order
to
justify
modern
individualist
competition
which
is
too
often
only
a
disguised
form
of
cannibalism
and
which
has
made
the
maxim
homini
man
to
man
a
wolf
or
freely
man
eats
man
the
characteristic
motto
of
our
era
while
hobbes
only
made
it
the
ruling
principle
of
the
of
of
mankind
before
the
making
of
the
social
contract
but
because
a
principle
has
been
abused
or
misused
we
are
not
justified
in
concluding
that
the
principle
itself
is
false
its
abuse
often
serves
as
an
incentive
to
define
its
nature
and
its
limitations
more
accurately
so
that
in
practice
it
may
be
applied
more
correctly
this
will
be
the
result
of
my
demonstration
of
the
perfect
harmony
that
reigns
between
socialism
and
darwinism
as
long
ago
as
the
first
edition
of
my
work
e
pages
i
maintained
that
the
struggle
for
existence
is
a
law
immanent
in
the
human
race
as
it
is
a
law
of
all
living
beings
although
its
forms
continually
change
and
though
it
undergoes
more
and
more
attenuation
this
is
still
the
way
it
appears
to
me
and
consequently
on
this
point
i
disagree
with
some
socialists
who
have
thought
they
could
triumph
more
completely
over
the
objection
urged
against
them
in
the
name
of
darwinism
by
declaring
that
in
human
society
the
struggle
for
existence
is
a
law
which
is
destined
to
lose
all
meaning
and
applicability
when
the
social
transformation
at
which
socialism
aims
shall
have
been
effected
it
is
a
law
which
dominates
tyrannically
all
living
beings
and
it
must
cease
to
act
and
fall
inert
at
the
feet
of
man
as
if
he
were
not
merely
a
link
inseparable
from
the
great
biological
chain
i
maintained
and
i
still
maintain
that
the
struggle
for
existence
is
a
law
inseparable
from
life
and
consequently
from
humanity
itself
but
that
though
remaining
an
inherent
and
constant
law
it
is
gradually
transformed
in
its
essence
and
attenuated
in
its
forms
among
primitive
mankind
the
struggle
for
existence
is
but
slightly
differentiated
from
that
which
obtains
among
the
other
animals
it
is
the
brutal
struggle
for
daily
food
or
for
possession
of
the
females
hunger
and
love
are
in
fact
the
two
fundamental
needs
and
the
two
poles
of
life
and
almost
its
only
method
is
muscular
violence
in
a
more
advanced
phase
there
is
joined
to
this
basic
struggle
the
struggle
for
political
supremacy
in
the
clan
in
the
tribe
in
the
village
in
the
commune
in
the
state
and
more
and
more
muscular
struggle
is
superseded
by
intellectual
struggle
in
the
historical
period
the
society
struggled
for
equality
the
abolition
of
slavery
it
triumphed
but
it
did
not
halt
because
to
live
is
to
struggle
the
society
of
the
middle
ages
struggled
for
equality
it
won
the
battle
but
it
did
not
halt
and
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
it
struggled
for
equality
must
it
now
halt
and
remain
stationary
in
the
present
state
of
progress
society
struggles
for
equality
not
for
an
absolute
material
equality
but
for
that
more
practical
truer
equality
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
and
all
the
evidence
enables
us
to
foresee
with
mathematical
certainty
that
this
victory
will
be
won
to
give
place
to
new
struggles
and
to
new
ideals
among
our
descendants
the
successive
changes
in
the
or
the
ideals
of
the
struggles
for
existence
are
accompanied
by
a
progressive
mitigation
of
the
methods
of
combat
violent
and
muscular
at
first
the
struggle
is
becoming
more
and
more
pacific
and
intellectual
notwithstanding
some
atavic
recurrences
of
earlier
methods
or
some
manifestations
of
individual
violence
against
society
and
of
social
violence
against
individuals
the
remarkable
work
of
novicow
has
recently
given
a
signal
confirmation
to
my
opinion
although
novicow
has
not
taken
the
sexual
struggle
into
account
i
will
develop
my
demonstration
more
fully
in
the
chapter
devoted
to
moral
de
the
intellectual
future
of
humanity
in
the
second
edition
of
e
for
the
moment
i
have
sufficiently
replied
to
the
objection
since
i
have
shown
not
merely
that
the
disproportion
between
the
number
of
births
and
the
number
of
those
who
survive
tends
to
constantly
diminish
but
also
that
the
struggle
for
existence
itself
changes
in
its
essence
and
grows
milder
in
its
processes
at
each
successive
phase
of
the
biological
and
social
evolution
socialism
may
then
insist
that
human
conditions
of
existence
ought
to
be
guaranteed
to
all
men
in
exchange
for
labor
furnished
to
collective
society
without
thereby
contradicting
the
darwinian
law
of
the
survival
of
the
victors
in
the
struggle
for
existence
since
this
darwinian
law
ought
to
be
understood
and
applied
in
each
of
its
varying
manifestations
in
harmony
with
the
law
of
human
progress
socialism
scientifically
understood
does
not
deny
and
can
not
deny
that
among
mankind
there
are
always
some
losers
in
the
struggle
for
existence
this
question
is
more
directly
connected
with
the
relations
which
exist
between
and
since
those
who
contend
that
the
struggle
for
existence
is
a
law
which
does
not
apply
to
human
society
declare
accordingly
that
an
abnormal
and
form
of
the
struggle
for
life
just
as
is
its
normal
and
social
form
is
destined
to
disappear
likewise
they
think
they
discover
a
certain
contradiction
between
socialism
and
the
teachings
of
criminal
anthropology
concerning
the
congenital
criminal
though
these
teachings
are
also
deducted
from
darwinism
i
reserve
this
question
for
fuller
treatment
elsewhere
here
is
in
brief
my
thought
as
a
socialist
and
as
a
criminal
anthropologist
in
the
first
place
the
school
of
scientific
criminologists
deal
with
life
as
it
now
is
and
undeniably
it
has
the
merit
of
having
applied
the
methods
of
experimental
science
to
the
study
of
criminal
phenomena
of
having
shown
the
hypocritical
absurdity
of
modern
penal
systems
based
on
the
notion
of
and
moral
delinquency
and
resulting
in
the
system
of
cellular
confinement
one
of
the
mental
aberrations
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
i
have
elsewhere
qualified
it
in
its
stead
the
criminologists
wish
to
substitute
the
simple
segregation
of
individuals
who
are
not
fitted
for
social
life
on
account
of
pathological
conditions
congenital
or
acquired
permanent
or
transitory
in
the
second
place
to
contend
that
socialism
will
cause
the
disappearance
of
all
forms
of
crime
is
to
act
upon
the
impulse
of
a
generous
sentiment
but
the
contention
is
not
supported
by
a
rigorously
scientific
observation
of
the
facts
the
scientific
school
of
criminology
demonstrates
that
crime
is
a
natural
and
social
phenomenon
like
insanity
and
suicide
determined
by
the
abnormal
organic
and
psychological
constitution
of
the
delinquent
and
by
the
influences
of
the
physical
and
social
environment
the
anthropological
physical
and
social
factors
all
always
act
concurrently
in
the
determination
of
all
offences
the
lightest
as
well
as
the
gravest
as
moreover
they
do
in
the
case
of
all
other
human
actions
what
varies
in
the
case
of
each
delinquent
and
each
offense
is
the
decisive
intensity
of
each
order
of
factors
for
instance
if
the
case
in
point
is
an
assassination
committed
through
jealousy
or
hallucination
it
is
the
anthropological
factor
which
is
the
most
important
although
nevertheless
consideration
must
also
be
paid
to
the
physical
environment
and
the
social
environment
if
it
is
a
question
on
the
contrary
of
crimes
against
property
or
even
against
persons
committed
by
a
riotous
mob
or
induced
by
alcoholism
it
is
the
social
environment
which
becomes
the
preponderating
factor
though
it
is
notwithstanding
impossible
to
deny
the
influence
of
the
physical
environment
and
of
the
anthropological
factor
we
may
repeat
the
same
reasoning
in
order
to
make
a
complete
examination
of
the
objection
brought
against
socialism
in
the
name
of
darwinism
on
the
subject
of
the
ordinary
diseases
crime
moreover
is
a
department
of
human
pathology
all
diseases
acute
or
chronic
infectious
or
not
infectious
severe
or
mild
are
the
product
of
the
anthropological
constitution
of
the
individual
and
of
the
influence
of
the
physical
and
social
environment
the
decisiveness
of
the
personal
conditions
or
of
the
environment
varies
in
the
various
diseases
phthisis
or
heart
disease
for
instance
depend
principally
on
the
organic
constitution
of
the
individual
though
it
is
necessary
to
take
the
influence
of
the
environment
into
account
pellagra
cholera
typhus
on
the
contrary
depend
principally
on
the
physical
and
social
conditions
of
the
environment
and
so
phthisis
makes
its
ravages
even
among
people
that
is
to
say
among
persons
well
nourished
and
well
housed
while
it
is
the
badly
nourished
that
is
to
say
the
poor
who
furnish
the
greatest
number
of
victims
to
pellagra
and
cholera
it
is
consequently
evident
that
a
socialist
regime
of
collective
property
which
shall
assure
to
every
one
human
conditions
of
existence
will
largely
diminish
or
possibly
annihilate
aided
by
the
scientific
discoveries
and
improvement
in
hygienic
measures
the
diseases
which
are
principally
caused
by
the
conditions
of
the
environment
that
is
to
say
by
insufficient
nourishment
or
by
the
want
of
protection
from
inclemency
of
the
weather
but
we
shall
not
witness
the
disappearance
of
the
diseases
due
to
traumatic
injuries
imprudence
pulmonary
affections
etc
the
same
conclusions
are
valid
regarding
crime
if
we
suppress
poverty
and
the
shocking
inequality
of
economic
conditions
hunger
acute
and
chronic
will
no
longer
serve
as
a
stimulus
to
crime
better
nourishment
will
bring
about
a
physical
and
moral
improvement
the
abuses
of
power
and
of
wealth
will
disappear
and
there
will
be
a
considerable
diminution
in
the
number
of
crimes
due
to
circumstances
crimes
caused
principally
by
the
social
environment
but
there
are
some
crimes
which
will
not
disappear
such
as
revolting
crimes
against
decency
due
to
a
pathological
perversion
of
the
sexual
instinct
homicides
induced
by
epilepsy
thefts
which
result
from
a
degeneration
etc
for
the
same
reasons
popular
education
will
be
more
widely
diffused
talents
of
every
kind
will
be
able
to
develop
and
manifest
themselves
freely
but
this
will
not
cause
the
disappearance
of
idiocy
and
imbecility
due
to
hereditary
pathological
conditions
nevertheless
it
will
be
possible
for
different
causes
to
have
a
preventive
and
mitigating
influence
on
the
various
forms
of
congenital
degeneration
ordinary
diseases
criminality
insanity
and
nervous
disorders
among
these
preventive
influences
may
be
a
better
economic
and
social
organization
the
prudential
counsels
constantly
growing
in
efficacy
given
by
experimental
biology
and
less
and
less
frequent
procreation
by
means
of
voluntary
abstention
in
cases
of
hereditary
disease
to
conclude
we
will
say
that
even
under
the
socialist
regime
although
they
will
be
infinitely
fewer
there
will
always
be
some
who
will
be
vanquished
in
the
struggle
for
existence
these
will
be
the
victims
of
weakness
of
disease
of
dissipation
of
nervous
disorders
of
suicide
we
may
then
affirm
that
socialism
does
not
deny
the
darwinian
law
of
the
struggle
for
existence
socialism
will
however
have
this
indisputable
advantage
the
epidemic
or
endemic
forms
of
human
degeneracy
will
be
entirely
suppressed
by
the
elimination
of
their
principal
cause
the
physical
poverty
and
its
necessary
consequence
the
mental
suffering
of
the
majority
then
the
struggle
for
existence
while
remaining
always
the
driving
power
of
the
life
of
society
will
assume
forms
less
and
less
brutal
and
more
and
more
humane
it
will
become
an
intellectual
struggle
its
ideal
of
physiological
and
intellectual
progress
will
constantly
grow
in
grandeur
and
sublimity
when
this
progressive
idealization
of
the
ideal
shall
be
made
possible
by
the
guarantee
to
every
one
of
daily
bread
for
the
body
and
the
mind
the
law
of
the
struggle
for
life
must
not
cause
us
to
forget
another
law
of
natural
and
social
darwinian
evolution
it
is
true
many
socialists
have
given
to
this
latter
law
an
excessive
and
exclusive
importance
just
as
some
individuals
have
entirely
neglected
it
i
refer
to
the
law
of
solidarity
which
knits
together
all
the
living
beings
of
one
and
the
same
species
for
instance
animals
who
live
gregariously
in
consequence
of
the
abundance
of
the
supply
of
their
common
food
herbivorous
animals
or
even
of
different
species
when
species
thus
mutually
aid
each
other
to
live
they
are
called
by
naturalists
species
and
instead
of
the
struggle
for
life
we
have
for
life
it
is
incorrect
to
state
that
the
struggle
for
life
is
the
sole
sovereign
law
in
nature
and
society
just
as
it
is
false
to
contend
that
this
law
is
wholly
inapplicable
to
human
society
the
real
truth
is
that
even
in
human
society
the
struggle
for
life
is
an
eternal
law
which
grows
progressively
milder
in
its
methods
and
more
elevated
in
its
ideals
but
operating
concurrently
with
this
we
find
a
law
the
influence
of
which
upon
the
social
evolution
constantly
increases
the
law
of
solidarity
or
between
living
beings
even
in
animal
societies
mutual
aid
against
the
forces
of
nature
or
against
other
animals
is
of
constant
occurrence
and
this
is
carried
much
further
among
human
beings
even
among
savage
tribes
one
notes
this
phenomenon
especially
in
tribes
which
on
account
of
the
favorable
character
of
their
environment
or
because
their
subsistence
is
assured
and
abundant
become
of
the
industrial
or
peaceful
type
the
military
or
warlike
type
which
is
unhappily
predominant
on
account
of
the
uncertainty
and
insufficiency
of
subsistence
among
primitive
mankind
and
in
reactionary
phases
of
civilization
presents
us
with
less
frequent
examples
of
it
the
industrial
type
constantly
tends
moreover
as
spencer
has
shown
to
take
the
place
of
the
warlike
type
confining
ourselves
to
human
society
alone
we
will
say
that
while
in
the
first
stages
of
the
social
evolution
the
law
of
the
struggle
for
life
takes
precedence
over
the
law
of
solidarity
with
the
growth
within
the
social
organism
of
the
division
of
labor
which
binds
the
various
parts
of
the
social
whole
more
closely
together
in
the
struggle
for
life
grows
milder
and
is
metamorphosed
and
the
law
of
or
solidarity
gains
more
and
more
both
in
efficiency
and
in
the
range
of
its
influence
and
this
is
due
to
that
fundamental
reason
that
marx
pointed
out
and
which
constitutes
his
great
scientific
discovery
the
reason
that
in
the
one
case
the
conditions
of
existence
food
especially
are
not
assured
and
in
the
other
case
they
are
in
the
lives
of
individuals
as
in
the
life
of
societies
when
the
means
of
subsistence
that
is
to
say
the
physical
basis
of
existence
are
assured
the
law
of
solidarity
takes
precedence
over
the
law
of
the
struggle
for
existence
and
when
they
are
not
assured
the
contrary
is
true
among
savages
infanticide
and
parricide
are
not
only
permitted
but
are
obligatory
and
sanctioned
by
religion
if
the
tribe
inhabits
an
island
where
food
is
scarce
for
instance
in
polynesia
and
they
are
immoral
and
criminal
acts
on
continents
where
the
food
supply
is
more
abundant
and
certain
just
so
in
our
present
society
as
the
majority
of
individuals
are
not
sure
of
getting
their
daily
bread
the
struggle
for
life
or
free
competition
as
the
individualists
call
it
assumes
more
cruel
and
more
brutal
forms
just
as
soon
as
through
collective
ownership
every
individual
shall
be
assured
of
fitting
conditions
of
existence
the
law
of
solidarity
will
become
preponderant
when
in
a
family
financial
affairs
run
smoothly
and
prosperously
harmony
and
mutual
prevail
as
soon
as
poverty
makes
its
appearance
discord
and
struggle
ensue
society
as
a
whole
shows
us
the
picture
on
a
large
scale
a
better
social
organization
will
insure
universal
harmony
and
mutual
this
will
be
the
achievement
of
socialism
and
to
repeat
for
this
the
fullest
and
most
fruitful
interpretation
of
the
inexorable
natural
laws
discovered
by
darwinism
we
are

we

the

of

which
is

which
contends

the

the
third
and
last
part
of
the
argument
of
haeckel
is
correct
if
applied
solely
to
the
purely
biological
and
darwinian
domain
but
its
starting
point
is
false
if
it
is
intended
to
apply
it
to
the
social
domain
and
to
turn
it
into
an
objection
against
socialism
it
is
said
the
struggle
for
existence
assures
the
survival
of
the
fittest
it
therefore
causes
an
aristocratic
hierarchic
gradation
of
selected
individuals
a
continuous
progress
and
not
the
democratic
leveling
of
socialism
here
again
let
us
begin
by
accurately
ascertaining
the
nature
of
this
famous
natural
selection
which
results
from
the
struggle
for
existence
the
expression
which
haeckel
uses
and
which
moreover
is
in
current
use
survival
of
the
best
or
of
the
best
fitted
ought
to
be
corrected
we
must
suppress
the
adjective
this
is
simply
a
persisting
relic
of
that
teleology
which
used
to
see
in
nature
and
history
a
premeditated
goal
to
be
reached
by
means
of
a
process
of
continuous
amelioration
or
progress
darwinism
on
the
contrary
and
still
more
the
theory
of
universal
evolution
has
completely
banished
the
notion
of
final
causes
from
modern
scientific
thought
and
from
the
interpretation
of
natural
phenomena
evolution
consists
both
of
involution
and
dissolution
it
may
be
true
and
indeed
it
is
true
that
by
comparing
the
two
extremes
of
the
path
traversed
by
humanity
we
find
that
there
has
really
been
a
true
progress
an
improvement
taking
it
all
in
all
but
in
any
case
progress
has
not
followed
a
straight
ascending
line
but
as
goethe
has
said
a
spiral
with
rhythms
of
progress
and
of
retrogression
of
evolution
and
of
dissolution
every
cycle
of
evolution
in
the
individual
life
as
in
the
collective
life
bears
within
it
the
germs
of
the
corresponding
cycle
of
dissolution
and
inversely
the
latter
by
the
decay
of
the
form
already
worn
out
prepares
in
the
eternal
laboratory
new
evolutions
and
new
forms
of
life
it
is
thus
that
in
the
world
of
human
society
every
phase
of
civilization
bears
within
it
and
is
constantly
developing
the
germs
of
its
own
dissolution
from
which
issues
a
new
phase
of
civilization
which
will
be
more
or
less
different
from
its
predecessor
in
geographical
situation
and
range
in
the
eternal
rhythm
of
living
humanity
the
ancient
hieratic
civilizations
of
the
orient
decay
and
through
their
dissolution
they
give
birth
to
the
world
which
in
turn
is
followed
by
the
feudal
and
aristocratic
civilization
of
central
europe
it
also
decays
and
disintegrates
through
its
own
excesses
like
the
preceding
civilizations
and
it
is
replaced
by
the
bourgeois
civilization
which
has
reached
its
culminating
point
in
the
world
but
it
is
already
experiencing
the
first
tremors
of
the
fever
of
dissolution
while
from
its
womb
there
emerges
and
is
developing
the
socialist
civilization
which
will
flourish
over
a
vaster
domain
than
that
of
any
of
the
civilizations
which
have
preceded
it
hence
it
is
not
correct
to
assert
that
the
natural
selection
caused
by
the
struggle
for
existence
assures
the
survival
of
the
in
fact
it
assures
the
survival
of
the
best
this
is
a
very
great
difference
alike
in
natural
darwinism
and
in
social
darwinism
the
struggle
for
existence
necessarily
causes
the
survival
of
the
individuals
best
fitted
for
the
environment
and
the
particular
historical
period
in
which
they
live
in
the
natural
biological
domain
the
free
play
of
natural
forces
and
conditions
causes
a
progressive
advance
or
ascent
of
living
forms
from
the
microbe
up
to
man
in
human
society
on
the
contrary
that
is
to
say
in
the
evolution
of
herbert
spencer
the
intervention
of
other
forces
and
the
occurrence
of
other
conditions
sometimes
causes
a
retrograde
selection
which
always
assures
the
survival
of
those
who
are
best
fitted
for
a
given
environment
at
a
given
time
but
the
controlling
principle
of
this
selection
is
in
turn
affected
by
the
vicious
conditions
if
they
are
vicious
of
the
environment
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
question
of
social
selection
or
rather
social
selections
for
there
is
more
than
one
kind
of
social
selection
by
starting
from
this
idea
not
clearly
comprehended
some
writers
both
socialists
and
have
come
to
deny
that
the
darwinian
theories
have
any
application
to
human
society
it
is
known
indeed
that
in
the
contemporaneous
civilized
world
natural
selection
is
injuriously
interfered
with
by
selection
by
selection
and
above
all
by
selection
the
temporary
celibacy
imposed
upon
soldiers
certainly
has
a
deplorable
effect
upon
the
human
race
it
is
the
young
men
who
on
account
of
comparatively
poor
physical
constitutions
are
excused
from
military
service
who
marry
the

while
the
healthier
individuals
are
condemned
to
a
transitory
sterility
and
in
the
great
cities
run
the
risk
of
contagion
from
syphilis
which
unfortunately
has
permanent
effects
marriage
also
corrupted
as
it
is
in
the
existent
society
by
economic
considerations
is
ordinarily
in
practice
a
sort
of
retrogressive
sexual
selection
women
who
are
true
degenerates
but
who
have
good
dowries
or
prospects
readily
find

market
while
the
most
robust
women
of
the
people
or
of
the
middle
class
who
have
no
dowries
are
condemned
to
the
sterility
of
compulsory
or
to
surrender
themselves
to
a
more
or
less
gilded
prostitution
it
is
indisputable
that
the
present
economic
conditions
exercise
an
influence
upon
all
the
social
relations
of
men
the
monopoly
of
wealth
assures
to
its
possessor
the
victory
in
the
struggle
for
existence
rich
people
even
though
they
are
less
robust
have
longer
lives
than
those
who
are
the
under
inhuman
conditions
imposed
upon
grown
men
and
the
still
more
baleful
labor
imposed
upon
women
and
children
by
modern
capitalism
causes
a
constant
deterioration
in
the
biological
conditions
of
the
toiling
masses
in
addition
to
all
these
we
must
not
forget
the
moral
selection
which
is
really
immoral
or
retrograde
made
at
present
by
capitalism
in
its
struggle
with
the
proletariat
and
which
favors
the
survival
of
those
with
servile
characters
while
it
persecutes
and
strives
to
suppress
all
those
who
are
strong
in
character
and
all
who
do
not
seem
disposed
to
tamely
submit
to
the
yoke
of
the
present
economic
order
the
first
impression
which
springs
from
the
recognition
of
these
facts
is
that
the
darwinian
law
of
natural
selection
does
not
hold
good
in
human
society
in
short
is
inapplicable
to
human
society
i
have
maintained
and
i
do
maintain
on
the
contrary
in
the
first
place
that
these
various
kinds
of
retrograde
social
selection
are
not
in
contradiction
with
the
darwinian
law
and
that
moreover
they
serve
as
the
material
for
an
argument
in
favor
of
socialism
nothing
but
socialism
in
fact
can
make
this
inexorable
law
of
natural
selection
work
more
beneficently
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
darwinian
law
does
not
cause
the
survival
of
the
but
simply
the
survival
of
the
it
is
obvious
that
the
forms
of
degeneracy
produced
by
the
divers
kinds
of
social
selection
and
notably
by
the
present
economic
organization
merely
promote
indeed
and
with
growing
efficiency
the
survival
of
those
best
fitted
for
this
very
economic
organization
if
the
victors
in
the
struggle
for
existence
are
the
worst
and
the
weakest
this
does
not
mean
that
the
darwinian
law
does
not
hold
good
it
means
simply
that
the
environment
is
corrupt
and
corrupting
and
that
those
who
survive
are
precisely
those
who
are
the
fittest
for
this
corrupt
environment
in
my
studies
of
criminal
psychology
i
have
too
often
had
to
recognize
the
fact
that
in
prisons
and
in
the
criminal
world
it
is
the
most
cruel
or
the
most
cunning
criminals
who
enjoy
the
fruits
of
victory
it
is
just
the
same
in
our
modern
economic
individualist
system
the
victory
goes
to
him
who
has
the
fewest
scruples
the
struggle
for
existence
favors
him
who
is
fittest
for
a
world
where
a
man
is
valued
for
what
he
has
no
matter
how
he
got
it
and
not
for
what
he
is
the
darwinian
law
of
natural
selection
functions
then
even
in
human
society
the
error
of
those
who
deny
this
proposition
springs
from
the
fact
that
they
confound
the
present
environment
and
the
present
transitory
historical
era
which
are
known
in
history
as
the
environment
and
period
just
as
the
middle
ages
are
called
with
all
history
and
all
humanity
and
therefore
they
fail
to
see
that
the
disastrous
effects
of
modern
retrograde
social
selection
are
only
confirmations
of
the
darwinian
law
of
the
survival
of
the
popular
common
sense
has
long
recognized
this
influence
of
the
surroundings
as
is
shown
by
many
a
common
proverb
and
its
scientific
explanation
is
to
be
found
in
the
necessary
biological
relations
which
exist
between
a
given
environment
and
the
individuals
who
are
born
struggle
and
survive
in
that
environment
on
the
other
hand
this
truth
constitutes
an
unanswerable
argument
in
favor
of
socialism
by
freeing
the
environment
from
all
the
corruptions
with
which
our
unbridled
economic
individualism
pollutes
it
socialism
will
necessarily
correct
the
ill
effects
of
natural
and
social
selection
in
a
physically
and
morally
wholesome
environment
the
individuals
best
fitted
to
it
those
who
will
therefore
survive
will
be
the
physically
and
morally
healthy
in
the
struggle
for
existence
the
victory
will
then
go
to
him
who
has
the
greatest
and
most
prolific
physical
intellectual
and
moral
energies
the
collectivist
economic
organization
by
assuring
to
everyone
the
conditions
of
existence
will
and
necessarily
must
result
in
the
physical
and
moral
improvement
of
the
human
race
to
this
some
one
replies
suppose
we
grant
that
socialism
and
darwinian
selection
may
be
reconciled
is
it
not
obvious
that
the
survival
of
the
fittest
tends
to
establish
an
aristocratic
gradation
of
individuals
which
is
contrary
to
socialistic
leveling
i
have
already
answered
this
objection
in
part
by
pointing
out
that
socialism
will
assure
to
all
individuals
instead
of
as
at
present
only
to
a
privileged
few
or
to
society
heroes
freedom
to
assert
and
develop
their
own
individualities
then
in
truth
the
result
of
the
struggle
for
existence
will
be
the
survival
of
the
best
and
this
for
the
very
reason
that
in
a
wholesome
environment
the
victory
is
won
by
the
healthiest
individuals
social
darwinism
then
as
a
continuation
and
complement
of
natural
biological
darwinism
will
result
in
a
selection
of
the
best
to
respond
fully
to
this
insistence
upon
an
unlimited
aristocratic
selection
i
must
call
attention
to
another
natural
law
which
serves
to
complete
that
rhythm
of
action
and
reaction
which
results
in
the
equilibrium
of
life
to
the
darwinian
law
of
natural
inequalities
we
must
add
another
law
which
is
inseparable
from
it
and
which
jacoby
following
in
the
track
of
the
labors
of
morel
lucas
galton

and
others
has
clearly
demonstrated
and
expounded
this
same
nature
which
makes
choice
and
aristocratic

a
condition
of
vital
progress
afterwards
restores
the
equilibrium
by
a
leveling
and
democratic
law
from
the
infinite
throng
of
humanity
there
emerge
individuals
families
and
races
which
tend
to
rise
above
the
common
level
painfully
climbing
the
steep
heights
they
reach
the
summits
of
power
wealth
intelligence
and
talent
and
having
reached
the
goal
they
are
hurled
down
and
disappear
in
the
abysses
of
insanity
and
degeneration
death
is
the
great
leveler
by
destroying
every
one
who
rises
above
the
common
herd
it
democratizes
humanity
every
one
who
attempts
to
create
a
monopoly
of
natural
forces
comes
into
violent
conflict
with
that
supreme
law
of
nature
which
has
given
to
all
living
beings
the
use
and
disposal
of
the
natural
agents

but

the

the

the

so
many
natural

inexorably
blasts
them
with
degeneracy
or
sterility
no
matter
whether
they
be
the
product
of
the
organic
life
or
the
effect
of

and
so
all
families
possessing
a

are
inevitably

finally
to

socialism
and

not
one
of
the
three
contradictions
between
socialism
and
darwinism
which
haeckel
formulated
and
which
so
many
others
have
echoed
since
resists
a
candid
and
more
accurate
examination
of
the
natural
laws
which
bear
the
name
of
charles
darwin
i
add
that
not
only
is
darwinism
not
in
contradiction
with
socialism
but
that
it
constitutes
one
of
its
fundamental
scientific
premises
as
virchow
justly
remarked
socialism
is
nothing
but
a
logical
and
vital
corollary
in
part
of
darwinism
in
part
of
spencerian
evolution
the
theory
of
darwin
whether
we
wish
it
or
not
by
demonstrating
that
man
is
descended
from
the
animals
has
dealt
a
severe
blow
to
the
belief
in
god
as
the
creator
of
the
universe
and
of
man
by
a
special
this
moreover
is
why
the
most
bitter
opposition
and
the
only
opposition
which
still
continues
to
its
scientific
inductions
was
made
and
is
made
in
the
name
of
religion
it
is
true
that
darwin
did
not
declare
himself
an
atheist
and
that
spencer
is
not
one
it
is
also
true
that
strictly
speaking
the
theory
of
darwin
like
that
of
spencer
can
also
be
reconciled
with
the
belief
in
god
since
it
may
be
admitted
that
god
created
matter
and
force
and
that
both
afterward
evolved
into
their
successive
forms
in
accordance
with
the
initial
creative
impulse
nevertheless
it
can
not
be
denied
that
these
theories
by
rendering
the
idea
of
causality
more
and
more
inflexible
and
universal
lead
necessarily
to
the
negation
of
god
since
there
always
remains
this
question
and
god
who
created
him
and
if
it
is
replied
that
god
has
always
existed
the
same
reply
may
be
flung
back
by
asserting
that
the
universe
has
always
existed
to
use
the
phrase
of
ardigò
human
thought
is
only
able
to
conceive
the
chain
which
binds
effects
to
causes
as
terminating
at
a
given
point
purely
conventional
god
as
laplace
said
is
an
hypothesis
of
which
exact
science
has
no
need
he
is
according
to
herzen
at
the
most
an
x
which
represents
not
the
as
spencer
and
dubois
raymond
contend
but
all
that
which
humanity
does
not
yet
know
therefore
it
is
a
variable
x
which
decreases
in
direct
ratio
to
the
progress
of
the
discoveries
of
science
it
is
for
this
very
reason
that
science
and
religion
are
in
inverse
ratio
to
each
other
the
one
diminishes
and
grows
weaker
in
the
same
proportion
that
the
other
increases
and
grows
stronger
in
its
struggle
against
the
unknown
and
if
this
is
one
of
the
consequences
of
darwinism
its
influence
on
the
development
of
socialism
is
quite
obvious
the
disappearance
of
faith
in
the
hereafter
where
the
poor
shall
become
the
elect
of
the
lord
and
where
the
miseries
of
the
vale
of
tears
will
find
an
eternal
compensation
in
paradise
gives
greater
strength
to
the
desire
for
some
semblance
of
an
earthly
paradise
here
below
even
for
the
unfortunate
and
the
poor
who
are
the
great
majority
hartmann
and
guyau
have
shown
that
the
evolution
of
religious
beliefs
may
be
summarized
thus
all
religions
include
with
various
other
matters
the
promise
of
happiness
but
the
primitive
religions
concede
that
this
happiness
will
be
realized
during
the
life
of
the
individual
himself
and
the
later
religions
through
an
excess
of
reaction
place
its
realization
after
death
outside
the
human
world
in
the
final
phase
this
realization
of
happiness
is
once
more
placed
within
the
field
of
human
life
no
longer
in
the
ephemeral
moment
of
the
individual
existence
but
indeed
in
the
continuous
evolution
of
all
mankind
on
this
side
then
socialism
is
closely
related
to
the
religious
evolution
and
tends
to
substitute
itself
for
religion
since
its
aim
is
for
humanity
to
have
its
own
earthly
paradise
here
without
having
to
wait
for
it
in
the
which
to
say
the
least
is
very
problematical
therefore
it
has
been
very
justly
remarked
that
the
socialist
movement
has
many
traits
in
common
with
for
example
primitive
christianity
notably
that
ardent
faith
in
the
ideal
that
has
definitively
deserted
the
arid
field
of
bourgeois
skepticism
and
some
savants
not
socialists
such
as
wallace
de
lavaleye
and
the
roberty
admit
that
it
is
entirely
possible
for
socialism
to
replace
by
its
humanitarian
faith
the
faith
in
the
hereafter
of
the
former
religions
more
direct
and
potent
than
these
relations
between
socialism
and
faith
in
a
hereafter
are
however
the
relations
which
exist
between
socialism
and
the
belief
in
god
it
is
true
that
marxian
socialism
since
the
congress
held
at
erfurt
has
rightly
declared
that
religious
beliefs
are
private
affairs
and
that
therefore
the
socialist
party
combats
religious
intolerance
under
all
its
forms
whether
it
be
directed
against
catholics
or
against
jews
as
i
have
shown
in
an
article
against
but
this
breadth
of
superiority
of
view
is
at
bottom
only
a
consequence
of
the
confidence
in
final
victory
it
is
because
socialism
knows
and
foresees
that
religious
beliefs
whether
one
regards
them
with
sergi
as
pathological
phenomena
of
human
psychology
or
as
useless
phenomena
of
moral
incrustation
are
destined
to
perish
by
atrophy
with
the
extension
of
even
elementary
scientific
culture
this
is
why
socialism
does
not
feel
the
necessity
of
waging
a
special
warfare
against
these
religious
beliefs
which
are
destined
to
disappear
it
has
assumed
this
attitude
although
it
knows
that
the
absence
or
the
impairment
of
the
belief
in
god
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
factors
for
its
extension
because
the
priests
of
all
religions
have
been
throughout
all
the
phases
of
history
the
most
potent
allies
of
the
ruling
classes
in
keeping
the
masses
pliant
and
submissive
under
the
yoke
by
means
of
the
enchantment
of
religion
just
as
the
tamer
keeps
wild
beasts
submissive
by
the
terrors
of
the
cracks
of
his
whip
and
this
is
so
true
that
the
most
conservatives
even
though
they
are
atheists
regret
that
the
religious
sentiment
that
precious
narcotic
is
diminishing
among
the
masses
because
they
see
in
it
though
their
pharisaism
does
not
permit
them
to
say
it
openly
an
instrument
of
political
domination
unfortunately
or
fortunately
the
religious
sentiment
can
not
be
by
royal
decree
if
it
is
disappearing
the
blame
for
this
can
not
be
laid
at
the
door
of
any
particular
individual
and
there
is
no
need
of
a
special
propaganda
against
it
because
its
antidote
impregnates
the
air
we
breathe
saturated
with
the
inductions
of
experimental
science
and
religion
no
longer
meets
with
conditions
favorable
to
its
development
as
it
did
amid
the
superstitious
ignorance
of
past
centuries
i
have
thus
shown
the
direct
influence
of
modern
science
science
based
on
observation
and
experiment
which
has
substituted
the
idea
of
natural
causality
for
the
ideas
of
miracle
and
divinity
on
the
extremely
rapid
development
and
on
the
experimental
foundation
of
contemporary
socialism
democratic
socialism
does
not
look
with
unfriendly
eyes
upon
catholic
socialism
the
christian
socialism
of
southern
europe
since
it
has
nothing
to
fear
from
it
catholic
socialism
in
fact
aids
in
the
propagation
of
socialist
ideas
especially
in
the
rural
districts
where
religious
faith
and
practices
are
still
very
vigorous
but
it
will
not
win
and
wear
the
palm
of
victory
majorem

as
i
have
shown
there
is
a
growing
antagonism
between
science
and
religion
and
the
socialist
varnish
can
not
preserve
catholicism
the
earthly
socialism
has
moreover
a
much
greater
attractive
power
when
the
peasants
shall
have
become
familiar
with
the
views
of
catholic
socialism
it
will
be
very
easy
for
democratic
socialism
to
rally
them
under
its
own
flag
they
will
indeed
convert
themselves
socialism
occupies
an
analogous
position
with
regard
to
republicanism
just
as
atheism
is
a
private
affair
which
concerns
the
individual
conscience
so
a
republican
form
of
government
is
a
private
affair
which
interests
only
a
part
of
the
bourgeoisie
certainly
by
the
time
that
socialism
draws
near
to
its
day
of
triumph
atheism
will
have
made
immense
progress
and
a
republican
form
of
government
will
have
been
established
in
many
countries
which
submit
to
a
monarchical
regime
but
it
is
not
socialism
which
develops
atheism
any
more
than
it
is
socialism
which
will
establish
republicanism
atheism
is
a
product
of
the
theories
of
darwin
and
spencer
in
the
present
bourgeois
civilization
and
republicanism
has
been
and
will
be
in
the
various
countries
the
work
of
a
portion
of
the
capitalist
bourgeoisie
as
was
recently
said
in
some
of
the
conservative
newspapers
of
milan
della
and
when
the
monarchy
shall
no
longer
serve
the
interests
of
the
country
that
is
to
say
of
the
class
in
power
the
evolution
from
absolute
monarchy
to
constitutional
monarchy
and
to
republicanism
is
an
obvious
historical
law
in
the
present
phase
of
civilization
the
only
difference
between
the
two
latter
is
in
the
elective
or
hereditary
character
of
the
head
of
the
state
in
the
various
countries
of
europe
the
bourgeoisie
themselves
hill
demand
the
transition
from
monarchy
to
republicanism
in
order
to
put
off
as
long
as
possible
the
triumph
of
socialism
in
italy
as
in
france
in
england
as
in
spain
we
see
only
too
many
republicans
or
radicals
whose
attitude
with
regard
to
social
questions
is
more
bourgeois
and
more
conservative
than
that
of
the
intelligent
conservatives
at
montecitorio
for
example
there
is
imbriani
whose
opinions
on
religious
and
social
matters
are
more
conservative
than
those
of
di
rudini
imbriani
whose
personality
is
moreover
very
attractive
has
never
attacked
the
priests
or
monks
this
man
who
attacks
the
entire
universe
and
very
often
with
good
reason
although
without
much
success
on
account
of
mistaken
methods
and
he
was
the
only
one
to
oppose
even
the
consideration
of
a
law
proposed
by
the
ferrari
which
increased
the
tax
on
estates
inherited
by
collateral
heirs
socialism
then
has
no
more
interest
in
preaching
republicanism
than
it
has
in
preaching
atheism
to
each
his
role
or
task
is
the
law
of
division
of
labor
the
struggle
for
atheism
is
the
business
of
science
the
establishment
of
republicanism
in
the
various
countries
of
europe
has
been
and
will
be
the
work
of
the
bourgeoisie
themselves
whether
they
be
conservative
or
radical
all
this
constitutes
the
historical
progress
toward
socialism
and
individuals
are
powerless
to
prevent
or
delay
the
succession
of
the
phases
of
the
moral
political
and
social
evolution

an

of
the
different
modes
of
conceiving
of
the
individual
in
relation
to

the
eighteenth
century
closed
with
the
exclusive
glorification
of
the
individual
of
the
as
an
entity
in
himself
in
the
works
of
rousseau
this
was
only
a
beneficent
though
exaggerated
against
the
political
and
sacerdotal
tyranny
of
the
middle

this
individualism
led
directly
to
that
artificiality
in
politics
which
i
will
consider
a
little
further
on
in
studying
the
relations
between
the
theory
of
evolution
and
socialism
and
which
is
common
to
the
ruling
classes
under
the
bourgeois
regime

to
the
individualistic
anarchists

both
alike
imagine
that
the

modern
biology
has
radically
changed
this
conception
of
the
and
it
has
demonstrated
in
the
domain
of
biology
as
in
that
of
sociology
that
the
individual
is
himself
only
an
aggregation
of
more
simple
living
elements
and
likewise
that
the
individual
in
himself
the
of
the
germans
does
not
exist
in
independent
isolation
but
only
as
a
member
of

is
an
association

the

the

corresponds
to
the
metaphysics
of

just
as
the
conception

corresponds
to
the
scientific
character
of
modern
socialism
the

is
simply
a

the

nothing
but
a
federation
of
communes
provinces
and

the
organism
of
humanity
can
be
nothing
but
a
federation
of

if
it
is
absurd
to
conceive
of
a

whose

should
have
to
move
in
the

fashion
as
the
extremities
and
all
of

would
have
to
perform

is
no

in

the

the

for

have
to
have
the

the

the

for
symmetrical
uniformity

pathological
expression

we
disregard
those
considerations
of
a

make
it

to
conclude
as

have
done
elsewhere
that
the
only
possible
organization
for
italy
as
for
every
other
country
appeared
to
me
to
be
that
of
an
administrative
federalism
combined
with
political
unity
we
can
regard
it
as
manifest
that
at
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
individual
as
an
independent
entity
is
dethroned
alike

has
been
demonstrated
by

and
confirmed
by
all
the
inductive
sciences
from
astronomy
to
sociology
at
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
rousseau
thought
that
the
individual
alone
existed
and
that
society
was
an
artificial
product
of
the
social
contract
and
as
he
attributed
just
as
aristotle
had
done
in
the
case
of
slavery
a
permanent
human
character
to
the
transitory
manifestations
of
the
period
such
as
the
rottenness
of
the
regime
under
which
he
lived
he
further
thought
that
society
was
the
cause
of
all
evils
and
that
individuals
are
all
born
good
and
equal
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
on
the
contrary
all
the
inductive
sciences
agree
in
recognizing
that
society
the
social
aggregate
is
a
fact
of
nature
inseparable
from
life
in
the
vegetable
species
as
in
the
animal
species
from
the
lowest
animal
colonies
of
zoophytes
up
to
societies
of
mammals
herbivora
and
to
human
society
all
that
is
best
in
the

he
owes

the

as

if
he
could

would
fulfill
only
one
of
the
two
fundamental
requirements
needs
of
existence
alimentation
that
is
to
say
the
selfish
preservation
of
his
own
organism
by
means
of
that
primordial
and
fundamental
function
which
aristotle
designated
by
the
name
of
the
conquest
of
food
but
all
individuals
have
to
live
in
society
because
a
second
fundamental
requirement
of
life
imposes
itself
upon
the
individual
the
reproduction
of
beings
like
himself
for
the
preservation
of
the
species
it
is
this
life
of
relationship
and
reproduction
sexual
and
social
which
gives
birth
to
the
moral
or
social
sense
which
enables
the
individual
not
only
be
but
to
with
his
it
may
be
said
that
these
two
fundamental
instincts
of
life
bread
and
love
by
their
functioning
maintain
a
social
equilibrium
in
the
life
of
animals
and
especially
in
man
it
is
love
which
causes
in
the
great
majority
of
men
the
principal
physiological
and
psychical
expenditure
of
the
forces
accumulated
in
larger
or
smaller
quantities
by
the
consumption
of
daily
bread
and
which
the
daily
labor
has
not
absorbed
or
which
parasitic
inaction
has
left
intact
even
more
love
is
the
only
pleasure
which
truly
has
a
universal
and
equalitarian
character
the
people
have
named
it
the
paradise
of
the
poor
and
religions
have
always
bidden
them
to
enjoy
it
without
limits
be
fruitful
and
multiply
because
the
erotic
exhaustion
which
results
from
it
especially
in
males
diminishes
or
hides
beneath
the
pall
of
forgetfulness
the
tortures
of
hunger
and
servile
labor
and
permanently
enervates
the
energy
of
the
individual
and
to
this
extent
it
performs
a
function
useful
to
the
ruling
class
but
indissolubly
linked
to
this
effect
of
the
sexual
instinct
there
is
an
other
the
increase
of
the
population
hence
it
happens
that
the
desire
to
eternize
a
given
social
order
is
thwarted
and
defeated
by
the
pressure
of
this
population
which
in
our
epoch
assumes
the
characteristic
form
of
the
and
the
social
evolution

its
inexorable
and
inevitable
forward
march
it
follows
from
our
discussion
that
while
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
thought
that
society
was
made
for
the
individual
and
from
that
the
deduction
could
be
made
that
millions
of
individuals
could
and
ought
to
toil
and
suffer
for
the
exclusive
advantage
of
a
few
individuals
at
the
end
of
our
century
the
inductive
sciences
have
demonstrated
just
the
opposite
that
it
is
the
individual
who
lives
for
the
species
and
that
the
latter
is
the
only
eternal
reality
of
life
there
we
have
the
of
the
sociological
or
socialist
tendency
of
modern
scientific
thought
in
the
face
of
the
exaggerated
individualism
inherited
from
the
last
century
modern
biology
also
demonstrates
that
it
is
necessary
to
avoid
the
opposite
excess
into
which
certain
schools
of
utopian
socialism
and
of
communism
fall
the
excess
of
regarding
only
the
interests
of
society
and
altogether
neglecting
the
individual
an
other
biological
law
shows
us
in
fact
that
the
existence
of
the
aggregation
is
the
resultant
of
the
life
of
all
the
individuals
just
as
the
existence
of
an
individual
is
the
resultant
of
the
life
of
its
constituent
cells
we

the
socialism
which
characterizes
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
which
will
illumine
the
dawn
of
the
coming
century
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
entire
current
of
modern
thought
this
harmony
manifests
itself
even
on
the
fundamental
question
of
the
predominance
given
to
the
vital
necessity
of
collective
or
social
solidarity
over
the
dogmatic
exaggerations
of
individualism
and
if
the
latter
at
the
close
of
the
last
century
was
the
outward
sign
of
a
potent
and
fruitful
awakening
it
inevitably
leads
through
the
pathological
manifestations
of
unbridled
competition
to
the
libertarian
explosions
of
anarchism
which
preaches
individual
action
and
which

and
by
the
between
the
to
obtain
and
keep
control
of
the
economic
forces
upon
which
all
the
others
political
juridical
and
moral
necessarily
depend
i
will
have
occasion
to
speak
more
at
length
in
studying
the
relations
between
sociology
and
socialism
of
this
grand
conception
which
is
the
imperishable
glory
of
marx
and
which
assures
him
in
sociology
the
place
which
darwin
occupies
in
biology
and
spencer
in
philosophy
for
the
moment
it
suffices
for
me
to
point
out
this
new
point
of
contact
between
socialism
and
darwinism
the
expression
so
repugnant
when
first
heard
or
seen
and
i
confess
that
it
produced
this
impression
on
me
when
i
had
not
yet
grasped
the
scientific
import
of
the
marxian
theory
furnishes
us
if
it
be
correctly
understood
the
primary
law
of
human
history
and
therefore
it
alone
can
give
us
the
certain
index
of
the
advent
of
the
new
phase
of
evolution
which
socialism
foresees
and
which
it
strives
to
hasten
to
assert
the
existence
of
the
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
human
society
like
all
other
living
organisms
is
not
a
homogeneous
whole
the
sum
of
a
greater
or
smaller
number
of
individuals
it
is
on
the
contrary
a
living
organism
which
is
made
up
of
diverse
parts
and
their
differentiation
constantly
increases
in
direct
ratio
to
the
degree
of
social
evolution
attained
just
as
a
protozoon
is
almost
wholly
composed
of
albuminoid
gelatine
while
a
mammal
is
composed
of
tissues
widely
varying
in
kind
in
the
same
way
a
tribe
of
primitive
savages
without
a
chief
is
composed
simply
of
a
few
families
and
the
aggregation
is
the
result
of
mere
material
propinquity
while
a
civilized
society
of
the
historical
or
contemporaneous
period
is
made
up
of
social
classes
which
differ
the
one
from
the
other
either
through
the
constitutions
of
their
component
members
or
through
the
whole
of
their
customs
and
tendencies
and
their
personal
family
or
social
life
these
different
classes
may
be
rigorously
separated
in
ancient
india
they
range
from
the
to
the
in
the
europe
of
the
middle
ages
from
the
emperor
and
the
pope
to
the
feudatory
and
the
vassal
down
to
the
artisan
and
an
individual
can
not
pass
from
one
class
into
another
as
his
social
condition
is
determined
solely
by
the
hazard
of
birth
classes
may
lose
their
legal
character
as
happened
in
europe
and
america
after
the
french
revolution
and
exceptionally
there
may
be
an
instance
of
an
individual
passing
from
one
class
into
another
analogously
to
the
endosmose
and
exosmose
of
molecules
or
to
use
the
phrase
of
dumont
by
a
sort
of
social
capillarity
but
in
any
case
these
different
classes
exist
as
an
assured
reality
and
they
resist
every
juridical
attempt
at
leveling
as
long
as
the
fundamental
reason
for
their
differentiation
remains
it
is
karl
marx
who
better
than
any
one
else
has
proved
the
truth
of
this
theory
by
the
mass
of
sociological
observations
which
he
has
drawn
from
societies
under
the
most
diverse
economic
conditions
the
names
of
the
classes
the
circumstances
and
phenomena
of
their
hostile
contact
and
conflict
may
vary
with
the
varying
phases
of
social
evolution
but
the
tragic
essence
of
history
always
appears
in
the
antagonism
between
those
who
hold
the
monopoly
of
the
means
of
production
and
these
are
few
and
those
who
have
been
robbed
expropriated
of
them
and
these
are
the
great
majority
and
in
the
primitive
societies
as
soon
as
first
family
and
then
individual
ownership
of
land
has
superseded
the
primitive
collectivism
and
and
and
and
these
are
so
many
manifestations
of
one
and
the
same
fact
the
monopoly
of
wealth
on
one
side
and
productive
labor
on
the
other
now
the
great
importance
of
the
marxian
law
the
struggle
between
classes
consists
principally
in
the
fact
that
it
indicates
with
great
exactness
is
in
truth
the
vital
point
of
the
social
question
and
what
its
solution
may
be
reached
as
long
as
no
one
had
shown
on
positive
evidence
the
economic
basis
of
the
political
juridical
and
moral
life
the
aspirations
of
the
great
majority
for
the
amelioration
of
social
conditions
aimed
vaguely
at
the
demand
and
the
partial
conquest
of
some
instrumentality
such
as
freedom
of
worship
political
suffrage
public
education
etc
and
certainly
i
have
no
desire
to
deny
the
great
utility
of
these
conquests
but
the
always
remained
impenetrable
to
the
eyes
of
the
masses
and
as
economic
power
continued
to
be
the
privilege
of
a
few
all
the
conquests
and
all
the
concessions
had
no
real
basis
separated
as
they
were
from
the
solid
and
fecund
foundation
which
alone
can
give
life
and
abiding
power
now
that
socialism
has
shown
even
before
marx
but
never
before
with
so
much
scientific
precision
that
individual
ownership
private
property
in
land
and
the
means
of
production
is
the
vital
point
of
the
question
the
problem
is
formulated
in
exact
terms
in
the
consciousness
of
contemporaneous
humanity
what
method
will
it
be
necessary
to
employ
in
order
to
abolish
this
monopoly
of
economic
power
and
the
mass
of
suffering
and
ills
of
hate
and
injustice
which
flow
from
it
the
method
of
the
based
on
the
scientifically
proven
fact
that
every
class
tends
to
preserve
and
increase
its
acquired
advantages
and
privileges
teaches
the
class
deprived
of
economic
power
that
in
order
to
succeed
in
conquering
it
the
struggle
we
will
consider
further
on
the
forms
of
this
struggle
must
be
a
struggle
of
class
against
class
and
not
of
individual
against
individual
hatred
toward
such
or
such
an
individual
even
if
it
result
in
his
death
does
not
advance
us
a
single
step
toward
the
solution
of
the
problem
it
rather
retards
its
solution
because
it
provokes
a
reaction
in
the
general
feeling
against
personal
violence
and
it
violates
the
principle
of
for
the
human
which
socialism
proclaims
most
emphatically
for
the
benefit
of
all
and
against
all
opponents
the
solution
of
the
problem
does
not
become
easier
because
it
is
recognized
that
the
present
abnormal
condition
which
is
becoming
more
and
more
acute
misery
for
the
masses
and
pleasure
for
a
few
is
not
the
consequence
of
the
bad
intentions
of
such
or
such
an
individual
viewed
from
this
side
also
socialism
is
in
fact
in
perfect
harmony
with
modern
science
which
denies
the
free
will
of
man
and
sees
in
human
activity
individual
and
collective
a
necessary
effect
whose
determining
causes
are
the
conditions
of
race
and
environment
acting
concurrently
crime
suicide
insanity
misery
are
not
the
fruits
of
free
will
of
individual
faults
as
metaphysical
spiritualism
believes
and
neither
is
it
an
effect
of
free
will
a
fault
of
the
individual
capitalist
if
the
workingman
is
badly
paid
if
he
is
without
work
if
he
is
poor
and
miserable
all
social
phenomena
are
the
necessary
resultants
of
the
historical
conditions
and
of
the
environment
in
the
modern
world
the
facility
and
the
greater
frequency
of
communication
and
relations
of
every
kind
between
all
parts
of
the
earth
have
also
increased
the
dependence
of
every
fact
economic
political
juridical
ethical
artistic
or
scientific
upon
the
most
remote
and
apparently
unrelated
conditions
of
the
life
of
the
great
world
the
present
organization
of
private
property
with
no
restrictions
upon
the
right
of
inheritance
by
descent
or
upon
personal
accumulation
the
ever
increasing
and
more
perfect
application
of
scientific
discoveries
to
the
facilitation
of
human
labor
the
labor
of
adapting
the
materials
furnished
by
nature
to
human
needs
the
telegraph
and
the
the
constantly
overflowing
torrent
of
human
migrations
all
these
bind
with
invisible
but
infrangible
threads
the
existence
of
a
family
of
peasants
or
petty
to
the
life
of
the
whole
world
and
the
harvest
of
coffee
cotton
or
wheat
in
the
most
distant
countries
makes
its
effects
felt
in
all
parts
of
the
civilized
world
just
as
the
decrease
or
increase
of
the
are
phenomena
with
the
periodical
agricultural
crises
and
have
a
direct
influence
on
the
destinies
of
millions
of
men
this
magnificent
scientific
conception
of
the
unity
of
physical
forces
to
use
the
expression
of
secchi
or
of
universal
solidarity
is
far
indeed
from
that
infantile
conception
which
finds
the
causes
of
human
phenomena
in
the
free
wills
of
individuals
if
a
socialist
were
to
attempt
even
for
philanthropic
purposes
to
establish
a
factory
in
order
to
give
work
to
the
unemployed
and
if
he
were
to
produce
articles
out
of
fashion
or
for
which
there
was
no
general
demand
he
would
soon
become
bankrupt
in
spite
of
his
philanthropic
intentions
by
an
inevitable
effect
of
inexorable
economic
laws
or
again
if
a
socialist
should
give
the
laborers
in
his
establishment
wages
two
or
three
times
as
high
as
the
current
rate
of
wages
he
would
evidently
have
the
same
fate
since
he
would
be
dominated
by
the
same
economic
laws
and
he
would
have
to
sell
his
commodities
at
a
loss
or
keep
them
unsold
in
his
warehouses
because
his
prices
for
the
same
qualities
of
goods
would
be
above
the
market
price
he
would
be
declared
a
bankrupt
and
the
only
consolation
the
world
would
offer
him
would
be
to
call
him
an
and
in
the
present
phase
of
mercantile
ethics
we
know
what
this
expression
means
therefore
without
regard
to
the
personal
relations
more
or
less
cordial
between
capitalists
and
workingmen
their
respective
economic
situations
are
inexorably
determined
by
the
present
industrial
organization
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
which
enabled
marx
to
explain
and
demonstrate
irrefutably
how
the
capitalist
is
able
to
accumulate
wealth
without
working
because
the
laborer
produces
in
his
day
work
an
amount
of
wealth
exceeding
in
value
the
wage
he
receives
and
this
forms
the
gratuitous
unearned
profit
of
the
capitalist
even
if
we
deduct
from
the
total
profits
his
pay
for
technical
and
administrative
superintendence
this
unearned
still
remains
land
abandoned
to
the
sun
and
the
rain
does
not
of
itself
produce
either
wheat
or
wine
minerals
do
not
come
forth
unaided
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
a
bag
of
dollars
shut
up
in
a
safe
does
not
produce
dollars
as
a
cow
produces
calves
the
production
of
wealth
results
only
from
a
transformation
of
materials
effected
by
human
labor
and
it
is
only
because
the
peasant
tills
the
land
because
the
miner
extracts
minerals
because
the
laborer
sets
machinery
in
motion
because
the
chemist
makes
experiments
in
his
laboratory
because
the
engineer
invents
machinery
that
the
capitalist
or
the
landlord
though
the
wealth
inherited
from
his
father
may
have
cost
him
no
labor
and
though
he
may
practise
and
thus
make
no
personal
exertion
is
able
every
year
to
enjoy
riches
that
others
have
produced
for
him
in
exchange
for
wretched
lodgings
and
inadequate
nourishment
while
the
workers
are
in
most
cases
poisoned
by
the
miasmatic
vapors
from
rivers
or
marshes
by
gas
in
mines
and
by
dust
in
factories
in
brief
in
exchange
for
wages
which
are
always
inadequate
to
assure
the
workers
conditions
of
existence
worthy
of
human
creatures
even
under
a
system
of
absolute
which
has
been
called
a
form
of
practical
socialism
we
always
have
this
question
left
unanswered
by
what
miracle
does
the
landlord
who
does
not
work
get
his
barns
and
houses
filled
with
wheat
and
oil
and
wine
in
sufficient
quantities
to
enable
him
to
live
in
ample
comfort
while
the
the
tenant
on
shares
is
obliged
to
work
every
day
in
order
to
wrest
from
the
earth
enough
to
support
himself
and
his
family
in
wretchedness
and
the
system
of
does
at
least
give
the
tenant
the
tranquillizing
assurance
that
he
will
reach
the
end
of
the
year
without
experiencing
all
the
horrors
of
enforced
idleness
to
which
the
ordinary
day
or
wage
laborers
are
condemned
in
both
city
and
country
but
in
substance
the
whole
problem
in
its
entirety
remains
unsolved
even
under
this
system
and
there
is
always
one
man
who
lives
in
comfort
without
working
because
ten
others
live
poorly
by
working
this
is
the
way
the
system
of
private
property
works
and
these
are
the
consequences
it
produces
without
any
regard
to
the
wills
or
wishes
of
individuals
therefore
every
attempt
made
against
such
or
such
an
individual
is
condemned
to
remain
barren
of
results
it
is
the
ruling
tendency
of
society
the
objective
point
which
must
be
changed
it
is
private
ownership
which
must
be
abolished
not
by
a
dividing
up
which
would
result
in
the
most
extreme
and
pernicious
form
of
private
ownership
since
by
the
end
of
a
year
the
persistence
of
the
old
individualist
principle
would
restore
the
quo
and
all
the
advantage
would
accrue
solely
to
the
most
crafty
and
the
least
scrupulous
our
aim
must
be
the
abolition
of
private
ownership
and
the
establishment
of
collective
and
social
ownership
in
land
and
the
means
of
production
this
substitution
can
not
be
the
subject
for
a
decree
though
the
intention
to
effect
it
by
a
decree
is
attributed
to
us
but
it
is
in
course
of
accomplishment
under
our
eyes
every
day
from
hour
to
hour
directly
or
indirectly
directly
because
civilization
shows
us
the
continuous
substitution
of
public
ownership
and
social
functions
for
private
ownership
and
individual
functions
roads
postal
systems
railways
museums
city
schools
which
were
only
a
few
years
since
private
properties
and
functions
have
become
social
properties
and
functions
and
it
would
be
absurd
to
imagine
that
this
direct
process
of
socialization
is
destined
to
come
to
a
halt
instead
of
becoming
progressively
more
and
more
marked
in
accordance
with
every
tendency
of
our
modern
life
indirectly
since
it
is
the
outcome
toward
which
the
economic
individualism
of
the
bourgeoisie
tends
the
bourgeois
class
which
takes
its
name
from
the
dwellers
in
the
towns
which
the
feudal
chateau
and
the
church
symbols
of
the
class
then
dominant
protected
is
the
result
of
fecund
labor
intelligently
directed
toward
its
goal
and
of
historical
conditions
which
have
changed
the
economic
structure
and
tendency
of
the
world
the
discovery
of
america
for
instance
this
class
achieved
its
revolution
in
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
conquered
the
political
power
in
the
history
of
the
civilized
world
it
has
inscribed
a
page
in
letters
of
gold
by
those
wondrous
developments
in
the
lives
of
nations
that
are
truly
epic
in
character
and
by
its
marvelous
applications
of
science
to
industry
but
it
is
now
traversing
the
downward
branch
of
the
parabola
and
symptoms
are
appearing
which
announce
to
us
and
offer
proof
of
their
announcement
its
dissolution
without
its
disappearance
moreover
the
advent
and
establishment
of
a
new
social
phase
would
be
impossible
economic
individualism
carried
out
to
its
ultimate
logical
consequences
necessarily
causes
the
progressive
multiplication
of
property
in
hands
of
a
constantly
diminishing
number
of
persons
billionaire
is
a
new
word
which
is
characteristic
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
this
new
word
serves
to
express
and
emphasize
that
phenomenon
in
which
henry
george
saw
the
historic
law
of
individualism
of
the
rich
becoming
richer
while
the
poor
become
poorer
now
it
is
evident
that
the
smaller
is
the
number
of
those
who
hold
possession
of
the
land
and
the
means
of
production
the
easier
is
their
expropriation
with
or
without
indemnification
for
the
benefit
of
a
single
proprietor
which
is
and
can
be
society
alone
land
is
the
physical
basis
of
the
social
organism
it
is
then
absurd
for
it
to
belong
to
a
few
and
not
to
the
whole
social
collectivity
it
would
not
be
any
more
absurd
for
the
air
we
breathe
to
be
the
monopoly
of
a
few
that
the
socialization
of
the
land
and
the
means
of
production
is
truly
the
supreme
goal
of
socialism
but
evidently
it
can
not
be
reached
by
attacking
such
or
such
a
landlord
or
such
or
such
a
capitalist
the
individualist
mode
of
conflict
is
destined
to
remain
barren
of
results
or
to
say
the
least
it
requires
a
terribly
extravagant
expenditure
of
strength
and
efforts
to
obtain
merely
partial
or
provisional
results
and
so
those
politicians
whose
conception
of
statesmanship
is
a
career
of
daily
trivial
protests
who
see
nothing
in
politics
but
a
struggle
between
individuals
and
those
tactics
no
longer
produce
any
effect
either
on
the
public
or
on
legislative
assemblies
because
they
have
at
last
become
wonted
to
them
produce
just
about
as
much
effect
as
would
fantastic
champions
of
hygiene
who
should
attempt
to
render
a
marsh
inhabitable
by
killing
the
mosquitoes
one
by
one
with
shots
from
a
revolver
instead
of
adopting
as
their
method
and
their
goal
the
draining
of
the
pestilential
marsh
no
individual
conflicts
no
personal
violence
but
a
class
struggle
it
is
necessary
to
make
the
immense
army
of
workers
of
all
trades
and
of
all
professions
conscious
of
these
fundamental
truths
it
is
necessary
to
show
them
that
their
class
interests
are
in
opposition
to
the
interests
of
the
class
who
possess
the
economic
power
and
that
it
is
by
organization
that
they
will
conquer
this
economic
power
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
other
public
powers
that
modern
civilization
has
assured
to
free
peoples
it
may
nevertheless
be
foreseen
that
in
every
country
the
ruling
class
before
yielding
will
abridge
or
destroy
even
these
public
liberties
which
were
without
danger
for
them
when
they
were
in
the
hands
of
laborers
not
organized
into
a
party
but
forming
the
rearguard
of
other
purely
political
parties
as
radical
on
secondary
questions
as
they
are
profoundly
conservative
on
the
fundamental
question
of
the
economic
organization
of
property
a
therefore
a
struggle
of
class
against
class
and
a
struggle
this
is
understood
by
the
methods
of
which
i
will
soon
speak
in
discussing
the
four
modes
of
social
transformation
evolution
revolution
rebellion
individual
violence
but
a
in
the
darwinian
sense
which
renews
in
the
history
of
man
the
magnificent
drama
of
the
struggle
for
life
between
species
instead
of
degrading
us
to
the
savage
and
meaningless
brute
strife
of
individual
with
individual
we
can
stop
here
the
examination
of
the
relations
between
darwinism
and
socialism
might
lead
us
much
further
but
it
would
go
on
constantly
eliminating
the
pretended
contradiction
between
the
two
currents
of
modern
scientific
thought
and
it
would
on
the
contrary
confirm
the
essential
natural
and
indissoluble
harmony
that
there
is
between
them
thus
the
penetrating
view
of
virchow
is
confirmed
by
that
of
leopold
jacoby
the
same
year
in
which
appeared
darwin
book
and
coming
from
a
quite
different
direction
an
identical
impulse
was
given
to
a
very
important
development
of
social
science
by
a
work
which
long
passed
unnoticed
and
which
bore
the
title
de
by
karl
marx
it
was
the
forerunner
of
what
darwin
book
on
the
of
is
on
the
subject
of
the
genesis
and
evolution
of
organic
life
from
nature
up
to
man
the
work
of
marx
is
on
the
subject
of
the
genesis
and
evolution
of
association
among
human
beings
of
states
and
the
social
forms
of
humanity
and
this
is
why
germany
which
has
been
the
most
fruitful
field
for
the
development
of
the
darwinian
theories
is
also
the
most
fruitful
field
for
the
intelligent
systematic
propaganda
of
socialist
ideas
and
it
is
precisely
for
this
reason
that
in
berlin
in
the
windows
of
the
of
the
socialist
propaganda
the
works
of
charles
darwin
occupy
the
place
of
honor
beside

avoiding
both
of
the
mutually
exclusive
theses
that
civilization
is
a

or
a

i
have
always
maintained
by
my
theory
of

that
it
is
the
resultant
of
the
combined

letourneau
has
distinguished
four
phases

ethics
or
bourgeois
ethics
these
phases
will
be
followed
by
a
higher
phase
of
ethics
which
malon
has
called
ethics
some
persons
still
imbued
with
political
jacobin
artificiality
think
that
in
order
to
solve
the
social
question
it
will
be
necessary
to
generalize
the
system
of
they
imagine

though
they
do
not

let
all

become

and
it
does
not
occur
to
them
that
if
métayage
which
was
the
rule
has
become
a
less
and
less
frequent
exception
this
must
be
the
necessary
result
of
natural
causes
the
cause
of
the
transformation
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
represents
is
a
form
typical
of
petty
agricultural
industry
and
that
it
is
unable
to
compete
with
modern
agricultural
industry
organized
on
a
large
scale
and
well
equipped
with
machinery
just
as
handicrafts
have
not
been
able
to
endure
competition
with
modern
manufacturing
industry
it
is
true
that
there
still
are
some
handicraft
industries
in
a
few
villages
but
these
are
rudimentary
organs
which
merely
represent
an
anterior
phase
of
production
and
which
no
longer
have
any
important
function
in
the
economic

they
are
like

well

that
in

perhaps
in

of
the
relations

consideration
has
again
been
given
to
the
objections
to
the

recently
by

on
the

transmissibility
of

of

but
all
this
merely
concerns
such
or

a

while
the
fundamental
theory
of

remains
impregnable
part
second
evolution
and
socialism
the
theory
of
universal

which
apart
from
such
or
such
a
more
or
less
disputable
detail
is
truly
characteristic
of
the
vital
tendency
of
modern
scientific
thought
has
also
been
made
to
appear
in
absolute
contradiction
with
the
theories
and
the
practical
ideals
of
socialism
in
this
case
the
fallacy
is
obvious
if
socialism
is
understood
as
that
vague
complex
of
sentimental
aspirations
so
often
crystallized
into
the
artificial
utopian
creations
of
a
new
human
world
to
be
substituted
by
some
sort
of
magic
in
a
single
day
for
the
old
world
in
which
we
live
then
it
is
quite
true
that
the
scientific
theory
of
evolution
condemns
the
presumptions
and
the
illusions
of
artificial
or
utopian
political
theories
which
whether
they
are
reactionary
or
revolutionary
are
always
romantic
or
in
the
words
of
the
american
senator
ingalls
are
iridescent
dreams
but
unfortunately
for
our
adversaries
contemporary
socialism
is
an
entirely
different
thing
from
the
socialism
which
preceded
the
work
of
marx
apart
from
the
same
sentiment
of
protest
against
present
injustices
and
the
same
aspirations
toward
a
better
future
there
is
nothing
in
common
between
these
two
socialisms
neither
in
their
logical
structure
nor
in
their
deductions
unless
it
be
the
clear
vision
which
in
modern
socialism
becomes
a
mathematically
exact
prediction
thanks
to
the
theories
of
evolution
of
the
final
social
organization
based
on
the
collective
ownership
of
the
land
and
the
means
of
production
these
are
the
conclusions
to
which
we
are
led
by
the
evidence
of
the
facts
facts
verified
by
a
scientific
examination
of
the
three
principal
contradictions
which
our
opponents
have
sought
to
set
up
between
socialism
and
scientific
evolution
from
this
point
it
is
impossible
not
to
see
the
direct
causal
connection
between
marxian
socialism
and
scientific
evolution
since
it
must
be
recognized
that
the
former
is
simply
the
logical
consequence
of
the
application
of
the
evolutionary
theory
to
the
domain
of
economics
ix
the
orthodox
thesis
and
the
socialist
thesis
in
the
light
of
the
evolution
theory
what
in
substance
is
the
message
of
socialism
that
the
present
economic
world
can
not
be
immutable
and
eternal
that
it
merely
represents
a
transitory
phase
of
social
evolution
and
that
an
ulterior
phase
a
differently
organized
world
is
destined
to
succeed
it
that
this
new
organization
must
be
collectivist
or
socialist
and
no
longer
individualist
results
as
an
ultimate
and
certain
conclusion
from
the
examination
we
have
made
of
darwinism
and
socialism
i
must
now
demonstrate
that
this
fundamental
affirmation
of
socialism
leaving
out
of
consideration
for
the
moment
all
the
details
of
that
future
organization
of
which
i
will
speak
further
on
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
experiential
theory
of
evolutionism
upon
what
point
are
orthodox
political
economy
and
socialism
in
absolute
conflict
political
economy
has
held
and
holds
that
the
economic
laws
governing
the
production
and
distribution
of
wealth
which
it
has
established
are
not
in
the
sense
that
they
are
laws
naturally
determined
by
the
conditions
of
the
social
organism
which
would
be
correct
but
that
they
are
that
is
to
say
that
they
apply
to
humanity
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
and
consequently
that
they
are
immutable
in
their
principal
points
though
they
may
be
subject
to
modification
in
details
scientific
socialism
holds
on
the
contrary
that
the
laws
established
by
classical
political
economy
since
the
time
of
adam
smith
are
laws
peculiar
to
the
present
period
in
the
history
of
civilized
humanity
and
that
they
are
consequently
laws
essentially
to
the
period
of
their
analysis
and
discovery
and
that
just
as
they
no
longer
fit
the
facts
when
the
attempt
is
made
to
extend
their
application
to
past
historical
epochs
and
still
more
to
and
times
so
it
is
absurd
to
attempt
to
apply
them
to
the
future
and
thus
vainly
try
to
petrify
and
perpetuate
present
social
forms
of
these
two
fundamental
theses
the
orthodox
thesis
and
the
socialist
thesis
which
is
the
one
which
best
agrees
with
the
scientific
theory
of
universal
evolution
the
answer
can
not
be
doubtful
the
theory
of
evolution
of
which
herbert
spencer
was
the
true
creator
by
applying
to
sociology
the
tendency
to
relativism
which
the
historical
school
had
followed
in
its
studies
in
law
and
political
economy
even
then
heterodox
on
more
than
one
point
has
shown
that
everything
changes
that
the
present
phase
of
the
facts
in
astronomy
geology
biology
and
sociology
is
only
the
resultant
of
thousands
on
thousands
of
incessant
inevitable
natural
transformations
that
the
present
differs
from
the
past
and
that
the
future
will
certainly
be
different
from
the
present
spencerism
has
done
nothing
but
to
collate
a
vast
amount
of
scientific
evidence
from
all
branches
of
human
knowledge
in
support
of
these
two
abstract
thoughts
of
leibnitz
and
hegel
the
present
is
the
child
of
the
past
but
it
is
the
parent
of
the
future
and
nothing
is
everything
is
becoming
this
demonstration
had
already
been
made
in
the
case
of
geology
by
lyell
who
substituted
for
the
traditional
catastrophic
theory
of
cataclysmic
changes
the
scientific
theory
of
the
gradual
and
continuous
transformation
of
the
earth
it
is
true
that
notwithstanding
his
encyclopædic
knowledge
herbert
spencer
has
not
made
a
really
profound
study
of
political
economy
or
that
at
least
he
has
not
furnished
us
the
evidence
of
the
to
support
his
assertions
in
this
field
as
he
has
done
in
the
natural
sciences
this
does
not
alter
the
fact
however
that
socialism
is
after
all
in
its
fundamental
conception
only
the
logical
application
of
the
scientific
theory
of
natural
evolution
to
economic
phenomena
it
was
karl
marx
who
in
in
his
de
and
even
before
then
in
in
the
famous
written
in
collaboration
with
engels
nearly
ten
years
before
spencer
and
finally
in
supplemented
or
rather
completed
in
the
social
domain
the
scientific
revolution
begun
by
darwin
and
spencer
the
old
metaphysics
conceived
of
ethics
law
economics
as
a
finished
compilation
of
absolute
and
eternal
laws
this
is
the
conception
of
plato
it
takes
into
consideration
only
historical
times
and
it
has
as
an
instrument
of
research
only
the
fantastic
logic
of
the
the
generations
which
preceded
us
have
all
been
imbued
with
this
notion
of
the
absoluteness
of
natural
laws
the
conflicting
laws
of
a
dual
universe
of
matter
and
spirit
modern
science
on
the
contrary
starts
from
the
magnificent
synthetic
conception
of
monism
that
is
to
say
of
a
single
substance
underlying
all
phenomena
matter
and
force
being
recognized
as
inseparable
and
indestructible
continuously
evolving
in
a
succession
of
forms
forms
relative
to
their
respective
times
and
places
it
has
radically
changed
the
direction
of
modern
thought
and
directed
it
toward
the
grand
idea
of
universal
evolution
ethics
law
and
politics
are
mere
superstructures
effects
of
the
economic
structure
they
vary
with
its
variations
from
one
parallel
of
latitude
or
longitude
to
another
and
from
one
century
to
another
this
is
the
great
discovery
which
the
genius
of
karl
marx
has
expounded
in
his
de
i
will
examine
further
on
the
question
as
to
what
this
sole
source
or
basis
of
the
varying
economic
conditions
is
but
the
important
point
now
is
to
emphasize
their
constant
variability
from
the
ages
down
to
historical
times
and
to
the
different
periods
of
the
latter
moral
codes
religious
creeds
juridical
institutions
both
civil
and
criminal
political
organization
all
are
constantly
undergoing
transformation
and
all
are
relative
to
their
respective
historical
and
material
environments
to
slay
one
parents
is
the
greatest
of
crimes
in
europe
and
america
it
is
on
the
contrary
a
duty
enjoined
by
religion
in
the
island
of
sumatra
in
the
same
way
cannibalism
is
a
permitted
usage
in
central
africa
and
such
it
also
was
in
europe
and
america
in
ages
the
family
is
at
first
as
among
animals
only
a
sort
of
sexual
communism
then
polyandry
and
the
matriarchal
system
were
established
where
the
supply
of
food
was
scanty
and
permitted
only
a
very
limited
increase
of
population
we
find
polygamy
and
the
patriarchal
system
appearing
whenever
and
wherever
the
tyranny
of
this
fundamental
economic
cause
of
polyandry
ceases
to
be
felt
with
the
advent
of
historical
times
appears
the
monogamic
form
of
the
family
the
best
and
the
most
advanced
form
although
it
is
still
requisite
for
it
to
be
freed
from
the
rigid
conventionalism
of
the
indissoluble
tie
and
the
disguised
and
legalised
prostitution
the
fruits
of
economic
causes
which
pollute
it
among
us
how
can
any
one
hold
that
the
constitution
of
property
is
bound
to
remain
eternally
just
as
it
is
immutable
in
the
midst
of
the
tremendous
stream
of
changing
social
institutions
and
moral
codes
all
passing
through
evolutions
and
continuous
and
profound
transformations
property
alone
is
subject
to
no
changes
and
will
remain
petrified
in
its
present
form
a
monopoly
by
a
few
of
the
land
and
the
means
of
production
this
is
the
absurd
contention
of
economic
and
juridical
orthodoxy
to
the
irresistible
proofs
and
demonstrations
of
the
evolutionist
theory
they
make
only
this
one
concession
the
subordinate
rules
may
vary
the
may
be
diminished
the
principle
itself
is
unassailable
and
a
few
individuals
may
seize
upon
and
appropriate
the
land
and
the
means
of
production
necessary
to
the
life
of
the
whole
social
organism
which
thus
remains
completely
and
eternally
under
the
more
or
less
direct
domination
of
those
who
have
control
over
the
physical
foundation
of
life
nothing
more
than
a
perfectly
clear
statement
of
the
two
fundamental
theses
the
thesis
of
classical
law
and
economics
and
the
economic
and
juridical
thesis
of
socialism
is
necessary
to
determine
without
further
discussion
this
first
point
of
the
controversy
at
all
events
the
theory
of
evolution
is
in
perfect
unquestionable
harmony
with
the
inductions
of
socialism
and
or
the
contrary
it
flatly
contradicts
the
hypothesis
of
the
absoluteness
and
immutability
of

this

to
the
conflict
between
the
partisans
and
the

of

modern

denies
every

of
the

in
the
name
of
the
laws
of

an
intermediate
position
is
occupied
by
those
who
while
recognizing
that
the
freedom
of
man
will
is
not
absolute
hold
that
at
least
a
remnant
of
freedom
must
be
conceded
to
the
human
will
because
otherwise
there
would
no
longer
be
any
merit
or
any
blameworthiness
any

or
any

etc
i
considered
this
question
in

out
of

and
in
the
third
chapter
of
my

i
speak
of
it
here
only
in
order
to
show
the
analogy
in
the
form
of
the
debate
on
the
question
and
therefore
the
possibility
of
predicting
a
similar
ultimate
solution
the
true
conservative
drawing
his
inspiration
from
the
metaphysical
tradition
sticks
to
the
old
philosophical
or
economic
ideas
with
all
their
rigid
absolutism
at
least
he
is
logical
the
determinist
in
the
name
of
science
upholds
diametrically
opposite
ideas
in
the
domain
of
psychology
as
well
as
in
those
of
the
economic
or
juridical
sciences
the
eclectic
in
politics
as
in
psychology
in
political
economy
as
in
law
is
a
conservative
through
and
through
but
he
fondly
hopes
to
escape
the
difficulties
of
the
conservative
position
by
making
a
few
partial
concessions
to
save
appearances
but
if
the
eclecticism
is
a
convenient
and
agreeable
attitude
for
its
champions
it
is
like
hybridism
sterile
and
neither
life
nor
science
owe
anything
to
it
therefore
the
socialists
are
logical
when
they
contend
that
in
the
last
analysis
there
are
only
two
political
parties
the
individualists
conservatives
or
republicans
progressives
or
democrats
and
radicals
or
populists
and
the
socialists
x
the
law
of
apparent
retrogression
and
collective
ownership
admitting
say
our
adversaries
that
in
demanding
a
social
transformation
socialism
is
in
apparent
accord
with
the
evolutionist
theory
it
does
not
follow
that
its
positive
conclusions
notably
the
substitution
of
social
ownership
for
individual
ownership
are
justified
by
that
theory
still
further
they
add
we
maintain
that
those
conclusions
are
in
absolute
contradiction
with
that
very
theory
and
that
they
are
therefore
to
say
the
least
utopian
and
absurd
the
first
alleged
contradiction
between
socialism
and
evolutionism
is
that
the
return
to
collective
ownership
of
the
land
would
be
at
the
same
time
a
return
to
the
primitive
savage
state
of
mankind
and
socialism
would
indeed
be
a
transformation
but
a
transformation
in
a
backward
direction
that
is
to
say
against
the
current
of
the
social
evolution
which
has
led
us
from
the
primitive
form
of
collective
property
in
land
to
the
present
form
of
individual
property
in
land
the
form
characteristic
of
advanced
civilization
socialism
then
would
be
a
return
to
barbarism
this
objection
contains
an
element
of
truth
which
can
not
be
denied
it
rightly
points
out
that
collective
ownership
should
be
a
return
apparent
to
the
primitive
social
organization
but
the
conclusion
drawn
from
this
truth
is
absolutely
false
and
because
it
altogether
neglects
a
law
which
is
usually
forgotten
but
which
is
no
less
true
no
less
founded
on
scientific
observation
of
the
facts
than
is
the
law
of
social
evolution
this
is
a
sociological
law
which
an
able
french
physician
merely
pointed
out
in
his
studies
on
the
relations
between
transmutation
and
socialism
and
the
truth
and
full
importance
of
which
i
showed
in
my
before
i
became
a
militant
socialist
and
which
i
again
emphasized
in
my
recent
controversy
with
morselli
on
the
subject
of
divorce
this
law
of
apparent
retrogression
proves
that
the
reversion
of
social
institutions
to
primitive
forms
and
types
is
a
fact
of
constant
recurrence
before
referring
to
some
obvious
illustrations
of
this
law
i
would
recall
to
your
notice
the
fact
that
cognetti
de
martiis
as
far
back
as
had
a
vague
perception
of
this
sociological
law
his
work
primitive
nell
evoluzione
turin
so
remarkable
for
the
fullness
accuracy
and
reliability
of
its
collation
of
relevant
facts
made
it
possible
to
foresee
the
possibility
of
the
reappearance
in
the
future
economic
evolution
of
the
primitive
forms
characteristic
of
the
status
which
formed
the
of
the
social
evolution
i
also
remember
having
heard
carducci
say
in
his
lectures
at
the
university
of
bologna
that
the
later
development
of
the
forms
and
the
substance
of
literature
is
often
merely
the
reproduction
of
the
forms
and
the
substance
of
the
primitive
literature
in
the
same
way
the
modern
scientific
theory
of
monism
the
very
soul
of
universal
evolution
and
the
typical
and
definitive
form
of
systematic
scientific
experiential
human
thought
boldly
fronting
the
facts
of
the
external
world
following
upon
the
brilliant
but
erratic
speculations
of
metaphysics
is
only
a
return
to
the
ideas
of
the
greek
philosophers
and
of
lucretius
the
great
poet
of
naturalism
the
examples
of
this
reversion
to
primitive
forms
are
only
too
obvious
and
too
numerous
even
in
the
category
of
social
institutions
i
have
already
spoken

evolution
according
to
hartmann
in
the
primitive
stage
of
human
development
happiness
appeared
attainable
during
the
lifetime
of
the
individual
this
appeared
impossible
later
on
and
its
realization
was
referred
to
the
life
beyond
the
tomb
and
now
the
tendency
is
to
refer
its
realization
to
the
earthly
life
of
humanity
not
to
the
life
of
the
individual
as
in
primitive
times
but
to
series
of
generations
yet
unborn

truth
applies
to

the
right
of
freely
dissolving
the
tie
which
was
recognized
in

has
been
gradually
replaced
by
the
absolute

fancy
that

can
settle

by

pronounced
at

equilibrium
is

reversion

reverts
to
its
original
forms
and
restores
to

that
it
to
say
to

cell
a
healthier
constitution
this
some
phenomenon
may
be
traced
in
the
organization
of
property
spencer
himself
has
been
forced
to
recognize
that
there
has
been
an
inexorable
tendency
to
a
reversion
to
primitive
collectivism
since
ownership
in
land
at
first
a
family
attribute
then
industrial
as
he
has
himself
demonstrated
has
reached
its
culminating
point
so
that
in
some
countries
torrens
act
in
australia
land
has
become
a
sort
of
property
transferable
as
readily
as
a
share
in
a
read
as
proof
what
such
an
as
herbert
spencer
has
written
at
first
sight
it
seems
fairly
inferable
that
the
absolute
ownership
of
land
by
private
persons
must
be
the
state
which
industrialism
brings
about
but
though
industrialism
has
thus
far
tended
to
individualize
possession
of
land
while
individualizing
all
other
possession
may
be
doubted
whether
the
final
stage
is
at
present
ownership
established
by
force
does
not
stand
on
the
same
footing
as
ownership
established
by
contract
and
though
multiplied
sales
and
purchases
treating
the
two
ownerships
in
the
same
way
have
tacitly
assimilated
them
the
assimilation
may
eventually
be
denied
the
analogy
furnished
by
assumed
rights
of
possession
over
human
beings
helps
us
to
recognize
this
possibility
for
while
prisoners
of
war
taken
by
force
and
held
as
property
in
a
vague
way
being
at
first
much
on
a
footing
with
other
members
of
a
household
were
reduced
more
definitely
to
the
form
of
property
when
the
buying
and
selling
of
slaves
became
general
and
while
it
might
centuries
ago
have
been
thence
inferred
that
the
ownership
of
man
by
man
was
an
ownership
in
course
of
being
permanently
established
yet
we
see
that
a
later
stage
of
civilization
reversing
this
process
has
destroyed
ownership
of
man
by
man
similarly
at
a
stage
still
more
advanced
it
may
be
that
ownership
of
land
will
moreover
this
process
of
the
socialization
of
property
though
a
partial
and
subordinate
process
is
nevertheless
so
evident
and
continuous
that
to
deny
its
existence
would
be
to
maintain
that
the
economic
and
consequently
the
juridical
tendency
of
the
organization
of
property
is
not
in
the
direction
of
a
greater
and
greater
magnification
of
the
interests
and
rights
of
the
collectivity
over
those
of
the
individual
this
which
is
only
a
preponderance
will
become
by
an
inevitable
evolution
a
complete
substitution
as
regards
property
in
land
and
the
means
of
production
the
fundamental
thesis
of
socialism
is
then
to
repeat
it
again
in
perfect
harmony
with
that
sociological
law
of
apparent
retrogression
the
natural
reasons
for
which
have
been
so
admirably
analyzed
by
loria
thus
the
thought
and
the
life
of
primitive
mankind
are
moulded
and
directed
by
the
natural
environment
along
the
simplest
and
most
fundamental
lines
then
the
progress
of
intelligence
and
the
complexity
of
life
increasing
by
a
law
of
evolution
give
us
an
analytical
development
of
the
principal
elements
contained
in
the
first
genus
of
each
institution
this
analytical
development
is
often
when
once
finished
detrimental
to
each
one
of
its
elements
humanity
itself
arrived
at
a
certain
stage
of
evolution
reconstructs
and
combines
in
a
final
synthesis
these
different
elements
and
thus
returns
to
its
primitive
this
reversion
to
primitive
forms
is
not
however
a
pure
and
simple
repetition
therefore
it
is
called
the
law
of
retrogression
and
this
removes
all
force
from
the
objection
that
socialism
would
be
a
return
to
primitive
it
is
not
a
pure
and
simple
repetition
but
it
is
the
concluding
phase
of
a
cycle
of
a
grand
rhythm
as
asturaro

it
which
infallibly
and
inevitably
preserves
in
their
integrity
the
achievements
and
conquests
of
the
long
preceding
evolution
in
so
far
as
they
are
vital
and
fruitful
and
the
final
outcome
is
far
superior
objectively
and
subjectively
to
the
primitive
social
embryo
the
track
of
the
social
evolution
is
not
represented
by
a
closed
circle
which
like
the
serpent
in

cuts
off
all
hope
of
a
better
future
but
to
use
the

again
in

it
is
true
that
he
has
made

backward
he
thinks
that
the
amount
of
the

to
be
given
to
the
present
holders
of
the
land
would
be
so
great
that
this
would
make
next
to
impossible
that
nationalization
of
the
land
which
as
long
ago
as
henry
george
considered
as
the
only
and
that
gladstone
had
the
courage
to
propose
as
a
solution
of

question

the
inference
originally
drawn
the
aggregate
of
men
forming
the
community
are
the
supreme
owners
of
the
but
a
fuller
consideration
of
the
matter
has
led
me
to
the
conclusion
that
individual
ownership
subject
to
state
suzerainty
should
be
maintained
the
profound
study
which
spencer
has
made
in
justice
and
let
us
say
between
parentheses
this
work
together
with
his
and
negative
furnishes
sad
evidence
of
the
senile
mental
retrogression
that
even
herbert
spencer
has
been
unable
to
escape
moreover
its
subjective
aridity
is
in
strange
contrast
with
the
marvelous
wealth
of
scientific
evidence
poured
forth
in
his
earlier
works
is
based
on
these
two
arguments
i
the
present
landed
proprietors
are
not
the
direct
descendants
of
the
first
conquerors
they
have
in
general
acquired
their
titles
by
free
contract
ii
society
is
entitled
to
the
ownership
of
the
virgin
soil
as
it
was
before
it
was
cleared
before
any
improvements
or
buildings
were
put
upon
it
by
private
owners
the
indemnity
which
would
have
to
be
paid
for
these
improvements
would
reach
an
enormous
figure
the
answer
is
that
the
first
argument
would
hold
good
if
socialism
proposed
to
the
present
owners
but
the
question
presents
itself
in
a
different
form
society
places
the
expropriation
of
the
owners
of
land
on
the
ground
of
public
utility
and
the
individual
right
must
give
way
before
the
rights
of
society
just
as
it
does
at
present
leaving
out
of
consideration
for
the
moment
the
question
of
indemnity
to
reply
to
the
second
argument
in
the
first
place
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
improvements
are
not
exclusively
the
work
of
the
personal
exertions
of
the
owners
they
represent
at
first
an
enormous
accumulation
of
fatigue
and
blood
that
many
generations
of
laborers
have
left
upon
the
soil
in
order
to
bring
it
to
its
present
state
of
cultivation
and
all
of
this
for
the
profit
of
others
there
is
also
this
fact
to
be
remembered
that
society
itself
the
social
life
has
been
a
great
factor
in
producing
these
improvements
or
increased
values
since
public
roads
railways
the
use
of
machinery
in
agriculture
have
been
the
means
of
bestowing
freely
upon
the
landowners
large
unearned
increments
that
have
greatly
swollen
the
prices
of
their
lands
why
finally
if
we
are
to
consider
the
amount
and
the
character
of
this
indemnity
should
this
indemnity
be
and
why
even
under
present
conditions
if
a
landowner
for
various
reasons
such
as
cherished
memories
connected
with
the
land
values
it
at
a
sentimental
price
he
would
be
forced
under
the
right
of
eminent
domain
to
accept
the
market
value
without
any
extra
payment
for
his
affection
or
sentiment
it
would
be
just
the
same
in
the
case
of
the
collective
appropriation
which
would
moreover
be
facilitated
by
the
progressive
concentration
of
the
land
in
the
hands
of
a
few
great
landed
proprietors
if
we
were
to
assure
these
proprietors
the
term
of
the
natural
a
comfortable
and
tranquil
life
it
would
suffice
to
make
the
indemnity
meet
all

the
social
evolution
and
individual
liberty
the
conclusion
of
the
preceding
chapter
will
be
of
use
to
us
in
the
examination
of
the
second
contradiction
that
it
is
pretended
exists
between
socialism
and
the
theory
of
evolution
it
is
asserted
and
repeated
in
all
possible
tones
that
socialism
constitutes
a
tyranny
under
a
new
form
which
will
destroy
all
the
blessings
of
liberty
won
with
such
toil
and
difficulty
in
our
century
at
the
cost
of
so
many
sacrifices
and
of
so
many
martyrs
i
have
already
shown
in
speaking
of
anthropological
inequalities
that
socialism
will
on
the
contrary
assure
to
all
individuals
the
conditions
of
a
human
existence
and
the
possibility
of
developing
with
the
utmost
freedom
and
completeness
their
own
respective
individualities
it
is
sufficient
here
for
me
to
refer
to
another
law
which
the
scientific
theory
of
evolution
has
established
to
demonstrate
since
i
can
not
in
this
monograph
enter
into
details
that
it
is
an
error
to
assume
that
the
advent
of
socialism
would
result
in
the
suppression
of
the
vital
and
vitalizing
part
of
personal
and
political
liberty
it
is
a
law
of
natural
evolution
set
forth
and
illustrated
with
remarkable
clearness
by
ardigò
that
each
succeeding
phase
of
the
natural
and
social
evolution
does
not
destroy
the
vital
and
manifestations
of
the
preceding
phases
but
that
on
the
contrary
it
preserves
their
existence
in
so
far
as
they
are
vital
and
only
eliminates
their
pathological
manifestations
in
the
biological
evolution
the
manifestations
of
vegetable
life
do
not
efface
the
first
glimmerings
of
the
dawn
of
life
that
are
seen
even
before
in
the
crystallization
of
minerals
any
more
than
the
manifestations
of
animal
life
efface
those
of
vegetable
life
the
human
form
of
life
also
permits
the
continued
existence
of
the
forms
and
links
which
precede
it
in
the
great
series
of
living
beings
but
more
than
this
the
later
forms
only
really
live
in
so
far
as
they
are
the
product
of
the
primitive
forms
and
with
them
the
social
evolution
follows
the
same
law
and
this
is
precisely
the
interpretation
of
transition
periods
given
by
scientific
evolutionism
they
did
not
annihilate
the
conquests
of
the
preceding
civilizations
but
they
preserved
on
the
contrary
whatever
was
vital
in
them
and
fecundated
them
for
the
renaissance
of
a
new
civilization
this
law
which
dominates
all
the
magnificent
development
of
the
social
life
equally
governs
the
fate
and
the
parabolic
career
of
all
social
institutions
one
phase
of
social
evolution
by
following
upon
another
phase
eliminates
it
is
true
the
parts
that
are
not
vital
the
pathological
products
of
preceding
institutions
but
it
preserves
and
develops
the
parts
that
are
healthy
and
vigorous
while
ever
elevating
more
and
more
the
physical
and
moral
diapason
of
humanity
by
this
natural
process
the
great
stream
of
humanity
issued
from
the
virgin
forests
of
savage
life
and
developed
with
majestic
grandeur
during
the
periods
of
barbarism
and
the
present
civilization
which
are
superior
in
some
respects
to
the
preceding
phases
of
the
social
life
but
in
many
others
are
marred
by
the
very
products
of
their
own
degeneracy
as
i
pointed
out
in
speaking
of
reactionary
varieties
of
social
selection
and
as
an
example
of
this
it
is
certain
that
the
laborers
of
the
contemporaneous
period
of
the
bourgeois
civilization
have
in
general
a
better
physical
and
moral
life
than
those
of
past
centuries
but
it
can
not
be
denied
none
the
less
that
their
condition
as
free
is
inferior
in
more
than
one
particular
to
the
condition
of
the
of
antiquity
and
of
the
of
the
middle
ages
the
of
antiquity
was
it
is
true
the
absolute
property
of
his
master
of
the
man
and
he
was
condemned
to
well
nigh
an
animal
existence
but
it
was
to
the
interest
of
his
master
to
assure
him
daily
bread
at
the
least
for
the
slave
formed
a
part
of
his
estate
like
his
cattle
and
horses
just
so
the
serf
or
villein
of
the
middle
ages
enjoyed
certain
customary
rights
which
attached
him
to
the
soil
and
assured
him
at
the
least
save
in
case
of
famine
of
daily
bread
the
free
of
the
modern
world
on
the
contrary
is
always
condemned
to
labor
inhuman
both
in
its
duration
and
its
character
and
this
is
the
justification
of
that
demand
for
an
day
which
can
already
count
more
than
one
victory
and
which
is
destined
to
a
sure
triumph
as
no
permanent
legal
relation
binds
the
either
to
the
capitalist
proprietor
or
to
the
soil
his
daily
bread
is
not
assured
to
him
because
the
proprietor
no
longer
has
any
interest
to
feed
and
support
the
laborers
who
toil
in
his
factory
or
on
his
field
the
death
or
sickness
of
the
laborer
can
not
in
fact
cause
any
decrease
of
his
estate
and
he
can
always
draw
from
the
inexhaustible
multitude
of
laborers
who
are
forced
by
lack
of
employment
to
offer
themselves
on
the
market
that
is
why
not
because
proprietors
are
more
wicked
than
those
of
former
times
but
because
even
the
moral
sentiments
are
the
result
of
economic
conditions
the
landed
proprietor
or
the
superintendent
of
his
estate
hastens
to
have
a
veterinary
called
if
in
his
stable
a
cow
becomes
ill
while
he
is
in
no
hurry
to
have
a
doctor
called
if
it
is
the
son
of
the
who
is
attacked
by
disease
certainly
there
may
be
and
these
are
more
or
less
frequent
exceptions
here
and
there
a
proprietor
who
contradicts
this
rule
especially
when
he
lives
in
daily
contact
with
his
laborers
neither
can
it
be
denied
that
the
rich
classes
are
moved
at
times
by
the
spirit
of
benevolence
even
apart
from
the
and
that
they
thus
put
to
rest
the
inner
voice
the
symptom
of
the
moral
disease
from
which
they
suffer
but
the
inexorable
rule
is
nevertheless
as
follows
with
the
modern
form
of
industry
the
laborer
has
gained
political
liberty
the
right
of
suffrage
of
association
etc
rights
which
he
is
allowed
to
use
only
when
he
does
not
utilize
them
to
form
a
based
on
intelligent
apprehension
of
the
essential
point
of
the
social
question
but
he
has
lost
the
guarantee
of
daily
bread
and
of
a
home
socialism
wishes
to
give
this
guarantee
to
all
individuals
and
it
demonstrates
the
mathematical
possibility
of
this
by
the
substitution
of
social
ownership
for
individual
ownership
of
the
means
of
production
but
it
does
not
follow
from
this
that
socialism
will
do
away
with
all
the
useful
and
truly
fruitful
conquests
of
the
present
phase
of
civilization
and
of
the
preceding
phases
and
here
is
a
characteristic
example
of
this
the
invention
of
industrial
and
agricultural
machinery
that
marvelous
application
of
science
to
the
transformation
of
natural
forces
which
ought
to
have
had
only
beneficent
consequences
has
caused
and
is
still
causing
the
misery
and
ruin
of
thousands
and
thousands
of
laborers
the
substitution
of
machines
for
human
labor
has
inevitably
condemned
multitudes
of
workers
to
the
tortures
of
enforced
idleness
and
to
the
ruthless
action
of
the
iron
law
of
minimum
wages
barely
sufficient
to
prevent
them
from
dying
of
hunger
the
first
instinctive
reaction
or
impulse
of
these
unfortunates
was
and
still
is
unhappily
to
destroy
the
machines
and
to
see
in
them
only
the
instruments
of
their
undeserved
sufferings
but
the
destruction
of
the
machines
would
be
in
fact
only
a
pure
and
simple
return
to
barbarism
and
this
is
not
the
wish
or
purpose
of
socialism
which
represents
a
higher
phase
of
human
civilization
and
this
is
why
socialism
alone
can
furnish
a
solution
of
this
tragic
difficulty
which
can
not
be
solved
by
economic
individualism
which
involves
the
constant
employment
and
introduction
of
improved
machinery
because
its
use
gives
an
evident
and
irresistible
advantage
to
the
capitalist
it
is
necessary
and
there
is
no
other
solution
that
the
machines
become
collective
or
social
property
then
obviously
their
only
effect
will
be
to
diminish
the
aggregate
amount
of
labor
and
muscular
effort
necessary
to
produce
a
given
quantity
of
products
and
thus
the
daily
work
of
each
worker
will
be
decreased
and
his
standard
of
existence
will
constantly
rise
and
become
more
closely
correspondent
with
the
dignity
of
a
human
being
this
effect
is
already
manifest
to
a
limited
extent
in
those
cases
where
for
instance
several
small
farm
proprietors
found
societies
for
the
purchase
of
for
example
if
there
should
be
joined
to
the
small
proprietors
in
a
grand
fraternal
the
laborers
or
peasants
and
this
will
be
possible
only
when
the
land
shall
have
become
social
property
and
if
the
machines
were
municipal
property
for
example
as
are
the
and
if
the
commune
were
to
grant
their
use
for
the
labors
of
the
fields
the
machines
would
no
longer
produce
any
evil
effects
and
all
men
would
see
in
them
their
liberators
it
is
thus
that
socialism
because
it
represents
a
higher
phase
of
human
evolution
would
eliminate
from
the
present
phase
only
the
bad
products
of
our
unbridled
economic
individualism
which
creates
at
one
pole
the
billionaires
or
napoleons
of
finance
who
enrich
themselves
in
a
few
years
by
seizing
upon
in
ways
more
or
less
clearly
described
in
the
penal
code
the
public
funds
and
which
at
the
other
pole
accumulates
vast
multitudes
of
wretches
in
the
slums
of
the
cities
or
in
the
houses
of
straw
and
mud
which
reproduce
in
the
south
of
italy
the
quarters
of
the
helots
of
antiquity
or
in
the
valley
of
the
po
the
huts
of
the
australian
bushmen
no
intelligent
socialist
has
ever
dreamt
of
not
recognizing
all
that
the
bourgeoisie
has
done
for
human
civilization
or
of
tearing
out
the
pages
of
gold
that
it
has
written
in
the
history
of
the
civilized
world
by
its
brilliant
development
of
the
various
nations
by
its
marvelous
applications
of
science
to
industry
and
by
the
commercial
and
intellectual
relations
which
it
has
developed
between
different
peoples
these
are
permanent
conquests
of
human
progress
and
socialism
does
not
deny
them
any
more
than
it
wishes
to
destroy
them
and
it
accords
a
just
tribute
of
recognition
to
the
generous
pioneers
who
have
achieved
them
the
attitude
of
socialism
toward
the
bourgeoisie
might
be
compared
to
that
of
atheists
who
do
not
wish
either
to
destroy
or
to
refuse
their
admiration
to
a
painting
of
raphael
or
to
a
statue
of
because
these
works
represent
and
give
the
seal
of
eternity
to
religious
legends
but
socialism
sees
in
the
present
bourgeois
civilization
arrived
at
its
decline
the
sad
symptoms
of
an
irremediable
dissolution
and
it
contends
that
it
is
necessary
to
rid
the
social
organism
of
its
infectious
and
this
not
by
ridding
it
of
such
or
such
a
bankrupt
of
such
or
such
a
corrupt
official
of
such
or
such
a
dishonest
contractor
but
by
going
to
the
root
of
the
evil
to
the
indisputable
source
of
the
virulent
infection
by
radically
transforming
the
regime
through
the
substitution
of
social
ownership
for
individual
ownership
it
is
necessary
to
renew
the
healthy
and
vital
forces
of
human
society
to
enable
it
to
rise
to
a
higher
phase
of
civilization
then
it
is
true
the
privileged
classes
will
no
longer
be
able
to
pass
their
lives
in
idleness
luxury
and
dissipation
and
they
will
have
to
make
up
their
minds
to
lead
an
industrious
and
less
ostentatious
life
but
the
immense
majority
of
men
will
rise
to
the
heights
of
serene
dignity
security
and
joyous
brotherhood
instead
of
living
in
the
sorrows
anxieties
and
bitter
strife
of
the
present
an
analogous
response
may
be
made
to
that
banal
objection
that
socialism
will
suppress
all
liberty
that
objection
repeated
to
satiety
by
all
those
who
more
or
less
consciously
conceal
under
the
colors
of
political
liberalism
the
tendencies
of
economic
conservatism
that
repugnance
which
many
people
even
in
good
faith
show
toward
socialism
is
it
not
the
manifestation
of
another
law
of
human
evolution
which
herbert
spencer
has
formulated
thus
every
progress
effected
is
an
obstacle
to
further
progress
this
is
in
fact
a
natural
psychological
tendency
a
tendency
analogous
to
to
refuse
to
consider
the
ideal
attained
the
progress
effected
as
a
simple
instrument
a
for
further
progress
and
for
the
attainment
of
new
ideals
instead
of
contentedly
halting
to
adore
as
a
fetish
the
progress
already
effected
which
men
are
prone
to
look
upon
as
being
so
complete
that
it
leaves
no
room
for
new
ideals
and
higher
aspirations
just
as
the
savage
adores
the
whose
benefits
he
enjoys
for
itself
and
not
for
the
fruits
it
can
yield
and
in
the
end
makes
a
fetish
of
it
an
idol
too
holy
to
be
touched
and
therefore
barren
just
as
the
miser
who
has
learned
in
our
individualist
world
the
value
of
money
ends
by
adoring
the
money
in
itself
and
for
itself
as
a
fetish
and
an
idol
and
keeps
it
buried
in
a
safe
where
it
remains
sterile
instead
of
employing
it
as
a
means
for
procuring
himself
new
pleasures
in
the
same
way
the
sincere
liberal
the
son
of
the
french
revolution
has
made
liberty
an
idol
which
is
its
own
goal
a
sterile
fetish
instead
of
making
use
of
it
as
an
instrument
for
new
conquests
for
the
realization
of
new
ideals
it
is
understood
that
under
a
regime
of
political
tyranny
the
first
and
most
urgent
ideal
was
necessarily
the
conquest
of
liberty
and
of
political
sovereignty
and
we
who
arrive
upon
the
field
after
the
battle
is
fought
and
the
victory
won
we
gladly
pay
our
tribute
of
gratitude
for
that
conquest
to
all
the
martyrs
and
heroes
who
bought
it
at
the
price
of
their
blood
but
liberty
is
not
and
can
not
be
its
own
end
and
object
what
is
the
liberty
of
holding
public
assemblages
or
the
liberty
of
thought
worth
if
the
stomach
has
not
its
daily
bread
and
if
millions
of
individuals
have
their
moral
strength
paralyzed
as
a
consequence
of
bodily
or
cerebral
anemia
of
what
worth
is
the
theoretic
share
in
political
sovereignty
the
right
to
vote
if
the
people
remain
enslaved
by
misery
lack
of
employment
and
acute
or
chronic
hunger
liberty
for
liberty
sake
there
you
have
the
progress
achieved
turned
into
an
obstacle
to
future
progress
it
is
a
sort
of
political
masturbation
it
is
impotency
face
to
face
with
the
new
necessities
of
life
socialism
on
the
other
hand
says
that
just
as
the
subsequent
phase
of
the
social
evolution
does
not
efface
the
conquests
of
the
preceding
phases
neither
does
it
wish
to
suppress
the
liberty
so
gloriously
conquered
by
the
bourgeois
world
in
but
it
does
desire
the
laborers
after
they
have
become
conscious
of
the
interests
and
needs
of
their
class
to
make
use
of
that
liberty
to
realize
a
more
equitable
and
more
human
social
organization
nevertheless
it
is
only
too
indisputable
that
under
the
system
of
private
property
and
its
inevitable
consequence
the
monopoly
of
economic
power
the
liberty
of
the
man
who
does
not
share
in
this
monopoly
is
only
an
impotent
and
sentimental
toy
and
when
the
workers
with
a
clear
consciousness
of
their
wish
to
make
use
of
this
liberty
then
the
holders
of
political
power
are
forced
to
disown
the
great
liberal
principles
the
principles
of
by
suppressing
all
public
liberty
and
they
vainly
fancy
that
they
will
be
able
in
this
way
to
stop
the
inevitable
march
of
human
evolution
as
much
must
be
said
of
another
accusation
made
against
socialists
they
renounce
their
fatherland
it
is
said
in
the
name
of
internationalism
this
also
is
false
the
national
which
in
our
century
have
reconquered
for
italy
and
germany
their
unity
and
their
independence
have
really
constituted
great
steps
forward
and
we
are
grateful
to
those
who
have
given
us
a
free
country
but
our
country
can
not
become
an
obstacle
to
future
progress
to
the
fraternity
of
all
peoples
freed
from
national
hatreds
which
are
truly
a
relic
of
barbarism
or
a
mere
bit
of
theatrical
scenery
to
hide
the
interests
of
capitalism
which
has
been
shrewd
enough
to
realize
for
its
own
benefit
the
broadest
internationalism
it
was
a
true
moral
and
social
progress
to
rise
above
the
phase
of
the
communal
wars
in
italy
and
to
feel
ourselves
all
brothers
of
one
and
the
same
nation
it
will
be
just
the
same
when
we
shall
have
risen
above
the
phase
of
patriotic
rivalries
to
feel
ourselves
all
brothers
of
one
and
the
same
humanity
it
is
nevertheless
not
difficult
for
us
to
penetrate
thanks
to
the
historical
key
of
the
secret
of
the
contradictions
in
which
the
classes
in
power
move
when
they
form
an
international
league
the
london
banker
thanks
to
telegraphy
is
master
of
the
markets
in
pekin
new
york
and
petersburg
it
is
greatly
to
the
advantage
of
that
ruling
class
to
maintain
the
artificial
divisions
between
the
laborers
of
the
whole
world
or
even
those
of
old
europe
alone
because
it
is
only
the
division
of
the
workers
which
makes
possible
the
maintenance
of
the
power
of
the
capitalists
and
to
attain
their
object
it
suffices
to
exploit
the
primitive
fund
of
savage
hatred
for
foreigners
but
this
does
not
keep
international
socialism
from
being
even
from
this
point
of
view
a
definite
moral
scheme
and
an
inevitable
phase
of
human
evolution
just
so
and
in
consequence
of
the
same
sociological
law
it
is
not
correct
to
assert
that
by
establishing
collective
ownership
socialism
will
suppress
every
kind
of
individual
ownership
we
must
repeat
again
that
one
phase
of
evolution
can
not
suppress
all
that
has
been
accomplished
during
the
preceding
phases
it
suppresses
only
the
manifestations
which
have
ceased
to
be
vital
and
it
suppresses
them
because
they
are
in
contradiction
with
the
new
conditions
of
existence
begotten
by
the
new
phases
of
evolution
in
substituting
social
ownership
for
individual
ownership
of
the
land
and
the
means
of
production
it
is
obvious
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
suppress
private
property
in
the
food
necessary
to
the
individual
nor
in
clothing
and
objects
of
personal
use
which
will
continue
to
be
objects
of
individual
or
family
consumption
this
form
of
individual
ownership
will
then
always
continue
to
exist
since
it
is
necessary
and
perfectly
consistent
with
social
ownership
of
the
land
mines
factories
houses
machines
tools
and
instruments
of
labor
and
means
of
transportation
the
collective
ownership
of
libraries
which
we
see
in
operation
under
our
eyes
does
it
deprive
individuals
of
the
personal
use
of
rare
and
expensive
books
which
they
would
be
unable
to
procure
in
any
other
way
and
does
it
not
largely
increase
the
utility
that
can
be
derived
from
these
books
when
compared
to
the
services
that
these
books
could
render
if
they
were
shut
up
in
the
private
library
of
a
useless
in
the
same
way
the
collective
ownership
of
the
land
and
the
means
of
production
by
securing
to
everyone
the
use
of
the
machines
tools
and
land
will
only
increase
their
utility
a
and
let
no
one
say
that
when
men
shall
no
longer
have
the
exclusive
and
transferable
by
inheritance
etc
of
wealth
they
will
no
longer
be
impelled
to
labor
because
they
will
no
longer
be
constrained
to
work
by
personal
or
family
we
see
for
example
that
even
in
our
present
individualist
world
those
survivals
of
collective
property
in
land
to
which
laveleye
has
so
strikingly
called
the
attention
of
sociologists
continue
to
be
cultivated
and
yield
a
return
which
is
not
lower
than
that
yielded
by
lands
held
in
private
ownership
although
these
communist
or
collectivist
farmers
have
only
the
right
of
use
and
enjoyment
and
not
the
absolute
title
if
some
of
these
survivals
of
collective
ownership
are
disappearing
or
if
their
administration
is
bad
this
can
not
be
an
argument
against
socialism
since
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
in
the
present
economic
organization
based
on
absolute
individualism
these
organisms
do
not
have
an
environment
which
furnishes
them
the
conditions
of
a
possible
existence
it
is
as
though
one
were
to
wish
a
fish
to
live
out
of
water
or
a
mammal
in
an
atmosphere
containing
no
oxygen
these
are
the
same
considerations
which
condemn
to
a
certain
death
all
those
famous
experiments
the
socialist
communist
or
anarchist
colonies
which
it
has
been
attempted
to
establish
in
various
places
as
experimental
trials
of
socialism
it
seems
not
to
have
been
understood
that
such
experiments
could
only
result
in
inevitable
abortions
obliged
as
they
are
to
develop
in
an
individualist
economic
and
moral
environment
which
can
not
furnish
them
the
conditions
essential
for
their
physiological
development
conditions
which
they
will
on
the
contrary
have
when
the
whole
social
organization
shall
be
guided
by
the
collectivist
principle
that
is
to
say
when
society
shall
be
then
individual
tendencies
and
psychological
aptitudes
will
adapt
themselves
to
the
environment
it
is
natural
that
in
an
individualist
environment
a
world
of
free
competition
in
which
every
individual
sees
in
every
other
if
not
an
adversary
at
least
a
competitor
egoism
should
be
the
tendency
which
is
inevitably
most
highly
developed
as
a
necessary
result
of
the
instinct
of
especially
in
these
latest
phases
of
a
civilization
which
seems
to
be
driven
at
full
steam
compared
to
the
pacific
and
gentle
individualism
of
past
centuries
in
an
environment
where
every
one
in
exchange
for
intellectual
or
manual
labor
furnished
to
society
will
be
assured
of
his
daily
bread
and
will
thus
be
saved
from
daily
anxiety
it
is
evident
that
egoism
will
have
far
fewer
stimulants
fewer
occasions
to
manifest
itself
than
solidarity
sympathy
and
altruism
will
have
then
that
pitiless
maxim
homini
will
cease
to
be
true
a
maxim
which
whether
we
admit
it
or
not
poisons
so
much
of
our
present
life
i
can
not
dwell
longer
on
these
details
and
i
conclude
here
the
examination
of
this
second
pretended
opposition
between
socialism
and
evolution
by
again
pointing
out
that
the
sociological
law
which
declares
that
the
subsequent
phase
of
social
evolution
does
not
efface
the
vital
and
fruitful
manifestations
of
the
preceding
phases
of
evolution
gives
us
in
regard
to
the
social
organization
in
process
of
formation
a
more
exact
or
idea
than
our
opponents
think
who
always
imagine
that
they
have
to
refute
the
romantic
and
sentimental
socialism
of
the
first
half
of
this
century
this
shows
how
little
weight
there
is
in
the
objection
recently
raised
against
socialism
in
the
name
of
a
learned
but
vague
sociological
eclecticism
by
a
distinguished
italian
professor
vanni
contemporary
socialism
is
not
identified
with
individualism
since
it
places
at
the
foundation
of
the
social
organization
a
principle
which
is
not
that
of
individual
autonomy
but
rather
its
negation
if
notwithstanding
this
it
promulgates
individualist
ideas
which
are
in
contradiction
with
its
principles
this
does
not
signify
that
it
has
changed
its
nature
or
that
it
has
ceased
to
be
socialism
it
means
simply
that
it
lives
upon
and
by
contradictions
when
socialism
by
assuring
to
every
one
the
means
of
livelihood
contends
that
it
will
permit
the
assertion
and
the
development
of
all
individualities
it
does
not
fall
into
a
contradiction
of
principles
but
being
as
it
is
the
approaching
phase
of
human
civilization
it
can
not
suppress
nor
efface
whatever
is
vital
that
is
to
say
compatible
with
the
new
social
form
in
the
preceding
phases
and
just
as
socialist
internationalism
is
not
in
conflict
with
patriotism
since
it
recognizes
whatever
is
healthy
and
true
in
that
sentiment
and
eliminates
only
the
pathological
part
jingoism
in
the
same
way
socialism
does
not
draw
its
life
from
contradiction
but
it
follows
on
the
contrary
the
fundamental
laws
of
natural
evolution
in
developing
and
preserving
the
vital
part
of
individualism
and
in
suppressing
only
its
pathological
manifestations
which
are
responsible
for
the
fact
that
in
the
modern
world
as
prampolini
said
per
cent
of
the
cells
of
the
social
organization
are
condemned
to
anemia
because
per

my

an

of
this
social
and
political
pathology
as
it
appears
in
italy
richter
mène

loria

part
demonstrates
moreover
that
in
a
society
based
on
collective
ownership
selfishness
rightly
understood
will
still
remain
the
principal
motive
of
human
actions
but
that
it
will
then
be
the
means
of
realizing
a
social
harmony
of
which
it
is
the
worst
enemy
under
the
regime
of
individualism
here
is
an
example
of
this
on
a
small
scale
but
instructive
the
means
of
transportation
have
in
large
cities
followed
the
ordinary
process
of
progressive
socialization
at
first
everybody
went
on
foot
excepting
only
a
few
rich
persons
who
were
able
to
have
horses
and
carriages
later
carriages
were
made
available
for
the
public
at
a
fixed
rate
of
hire
the
which
have
been
used
in
paris
a
little
more
than
a
century
and
which
took
their
name
from
saint
fiacre
because
the
first
cab
stood
beneath
his
image
then
the
dearness
of
led
to
a
further
socialization
by
means
of
omnibuses
and
tramways
another
step
forward
and
the
socialization
will
be
complete
let
the
cab
service
omnibus
service
street
railways
become
a
municipal
service
or
function
and
every
one
will
be
able
to
make
use
of
it
gratis
just
as
he
freely
enjoys
the
railways
when
they
become
a
national
public
service
but
then
this
is
the
individualist
objection
everybody
will
wish
to
ride
in
cabs
or
on
trolleys
and
the
service
having
to
attempt
to
satisfy
all
will
be
perfectly
satisfactory
to
no
one
this
is
not
correct
if
the
transformation
had
to
be
made
suddenly
this
might
be
a
temporary
consequence
but
even
now
many
ride
gratis
on
passes
etc
on
both
railways
and
tramways
and
so
it
seems
to
us
that
every
one
will
wish
to
ride
on
the
street
cars
because
the
fact
that
it
is
now
impossible
for
many
to
enjoy
this
mode
of
locomotion
gives
rise
to
the
desire
for
the
forbidden
fruit
but
when
the
enjoyment
of
it
shall
be
free
and
there
could
be
restrictions
based
on
the
necessity
for
such
transportation
another
egoistic
motive
will
come
into
play
the
physiological
need
of
walking
especially
for
people
who
have
been
engaged
in
sedentary
labor
and
so
you
see
how
individual
selfishness
in
this
example
of
collective
ownership
on
a
small
scale
would
act
in
harmony
with
the
social
requirements
thus
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
unfounded
is
the
reasoning
among
the
opponents
of
socialism
that
the
failure
of
communist
or
socialist
colonies
is
an
objective
demonstration
of
the
instability
of
a
socialist
arrangement
of
society
this
is
what
yves
guyot
for
example
does
in
principes
de
paris
when
he
declares
in
the
name
of
individualist
psychology
that
socialism
is
restrictive
and
individualism
expansive
this
thesis
is
moreover
in
part
true
if
it
is
transposed
the
vulgar
psychology
which
answers
the
purposes
of
guyot
tyrannie
liv
iii
ch
i
is
content
with
superficial
observations
it
declares
for
instance
that
if
the
laborer
works
twelve
hours
he
will
produce
evidently
a
third
more
than
if
he
works
eight
hours
and
this
is
the
reason
why
industrial
capitalism
has
opposed
and
does
oppose
the
minimum
programme
of
the
three
eighths
eight
hours
for
work
eight
hours
for
sleep
and
eight
hours
for
meals
and
recreation
a
more
scientific
observation
demonstrates
on
the
contrary
as
i
said
long
ago
that
man
is
a
machine
but
he
does
not
function
after
the
fashion
of
a
machine
in
the
sense
that
man
is
a
living
machine
and
not
an
inorganic
machine
every
one
knows
that
a
locomotive
or
a
sewing
machine
does
in
twelve
hours
a
quantity
of
work
greater
by
than
it
does
in
eight
hours
but
man
is
a
living
machine
subject
to
the
law
of
physical
mechanics
but
also
to
those
of
biological
mechanics
intellectual
labor
like
muscular
labor
is
not
uniform
in
quality
and
intensity
throughout
its
duration
within
the
individual
limits
of
and
exhaustion
it
obeys
the
law
which
quetelet
expressed
by
his
binomial
curve
and
which
i
believe
to
be
one
of
the
fundamental
laws
of
living
and
inorganic
nature
at
the
start
the
force
or
the
speed
is
very
slight
afterward
a
maximum
of
force
or
speed
is
attained
and
at
last
the
force
or
speed
again
becomes
very
slight
with
manual
labor
as
with
intellectual
labor
there
is
a
maximum
after
which
the
muscular
and
cerebral
forces
decline
and
then
the
work
drags
along
slowly
and
without
vigor
until
the
end
of
the
forced
daily
labor
consider
also
the
beneficient
influence
of
a
reduction
of
hours
and
you
will
readily
understand
why
the
recent
english
reports
are
so
unanswerable
on
the
excellent
results
even
from
the
capitalist
point
of
view
of
the
reform
the
workingmen
are
less
fatigued
and
the
production
is
undiminished
when
these
economic
reforms
and
all
those
which
are
based
on
an
exact
shall
be
effected
under
the
socialist
regime
that
is
to
say
without
the
friction
and
the
loss
of
force
that
would
be
inevitable
under
capitalist
individualism
it
is
evident
that
they
will
have
immense
material
and
moral
advantages
notwithstanding
the
objections
of
the
present
individualism
which
can
not
see
or
which
forgets
the
profound
reflex
effects
of
a
change
of
the
social

then

others
and
this
is
a
consequence
of
that
first
false
conception
imagine
that
socialism
wishes
in
a
single
day
to
change
the
face
of
the
world
and
that
we
will
be
able
to
go
to
sleep
in
a
world
completely
bourgeois
and
to
wake
up
next
morning
in
a
world
completely
socialist
how
is
it
possible
not
to
see
some
one
then
says
that
all
this
is
directly
and
thoroughly
in
conflict
with
the
law
of
evolution
a
law
based
on
the
two
fundamental
ideas
which
are
characteristic
of
the
new
tendencies
of
scientific
thought
and
which
are
in
conflict
with
the
old
metaphysics
of
the
and
the
of
all
phenomena
in
all
domains
of
universal
life
from
astronomy
to
sociology
it
is
indisputable
that
these
two
objections
were
in
great
part
well
founded
when
they
were
directed
against
what
engels
has
called
utopian
socialism
when
socialism
before
the
time
of
karl
marx
was
merely
the
sentimental
expression
of
a
humanitarianism
as
noble
as
it
was
neglectful
of
the
most
elementary
principles
of
exact
science
it
was
altogether
natural
for
its
partisans
to
give
rein
to
the
impetuosity
of
their
generous
natures
both
in
their
vehement
protests
against
social
injustices
and
in
their
reveries
and
of
a
better
world
to
which
the
imagination
strove
to
give
precise
contours
as
witness
all
the
utopias
from
the
republic
of
plato
to
the
looking
backward
of
bellamy
it
is
easy
to
understand
what
opportunities
these
constructions
afforded
to
criticism
the
latter
was
false
in
part
moreover
because
it
was
the
offspring
of
the
habits
of
thought
peculiar
to
the
modern
world
and
which
will
change
with
the
change
in
the
environment
but
it
was
well
founded
in
part
also
because
the
enormous
complexity
of
social
phenomena
makes
it
impossible
to
prophesy
in
regard
to
all
the
details
of
a
social
organization
which
will
differ
from
ours
more
profoundly
than
the
present
society
differs
from
that
of
the
middle
ages
because
the
bourgeois
world
has
retained
the
same
foundation
individualism
as
the
society
which
preceded
it
while
the
socialist
world
will
have
a
fundamentally
different
polarization
these
prophetic
constructions
of
a
new
social
order
are
moreover
the
natural
product
of
that
artificiality
in
politics
and
sociology
with
which
the
most
orthodox
individualists
are
equally
deeply
imbued
individualists
who
imagine
as
spencer
has
remarked
that
human
society
is
like
a
piece
of
dough
to
which
the
law
can
give
one
form
rather
than
another
without
taking
into
account
the
organic
and
psychical
ethical
and
historical
qualities
tendencies
and
aptitudes
of
the
different
peoples
sentimental
socialism
has
furnished
some
attempts
at
utopian
construction
but
the
modern
world
of
politics
has
presented
and
does
present
still
more
of
them
with
the
ridiculous
and
chaotic
mess
of
laws
and
codes
which
surround
every
man
from
his
birth
to
his
death
and
even
before
he
is
born
and
after
he
is
dead
in
an
inextricable
network
of
codes
laws
decrees
and
regulations
which
stifle
him
like
the
in
the
cocoon
and
every
day
experience
shows
us
that
our
legislators
imbued
with
this
political
and
social
artificiality
do
nothing
but
copy
the
laws
of
the
most
dissimilar
peoples
according
as
the
fashion
comes
from
paris
or
berlin
instead
of
carefully
studying
the
facts
of
actual
life
the
conditions
of
existence
and
the
interests
of
the
people
in
their
respective
countries
in
order
to
adapt
their
laws
to
them
laws
which
if
this
is
not
done
remain
as
abundant
examples
show
dead
letters
because
the
reality
of
the
facts
of
life
does
not
permit
them
to
strike
their
roots
into
the
social
soil
and
to
develop
a
fruitful
life
on
the
subject
of
artificial
social
constructions
the
socialists
might
say
to
the
individualists
let
him
who
is
without
sin
cast
the
first
stone
the
true
reply
is
wholly
different
scientific
socialism
represents
a
much
more
advanced
phase
of
socialist
thought
it
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
modern
experiential
science
and
it
has
completely
abandoned
the
fantastic
idea
of
prophesying
at
the
present
time
what
human
society
will
be
under
the
new
collectivist
organization
what
scientific
socialism
can
affirm
and
does
affirm
with
mathematical
certainty
is
that
the
current
the
trajectory
of
human
evolution
is
in
the
general
direction
pointed
out
and
foreseen
by
socialism
that
is
to
say
in
the
direction
of
a
continuously
and
progressively
increasing
preponderance
of
the
interests
and
importance
of
the
species
over
the
interests
and
importance
of
the
individual
and
therefore
in
the
direction
of
a
continuous
of
the
economic
life
and
with
and
in
consequence
of
that
of
the
juridical
moral
and
political
life
as
to
the
petty
details
of
the
new
social
edifice
we
are
unable
to
foresee
them
precisely
because
the
new
social
edifice
will
be
and
is
a
and
product
of
human
evolution
a
product
which
is
already
in
process
of
formation
and
the
general
outlines
of
which
are
already
visible
and
not
an
artificial
construction
of
the
imagination
of
some
utopian
or
idealist
the
situation
is
the
same
in
the
social
sciences
and
the
natural
sciences
in
embryology
the
celebrated
law
of
haeckel
tells
us
that
the
development
of
the
embryo
reproduces
in
miniature
the
various
forms
of
development
of
the
animal
which
have
preceded
it
in
the
zoological
series
but
the
biologist
by
studying
a
human
embryo
of
a
few
days
or
a
few
weeks
growth
can
not
tell
whether
it
will
be
male
or
female
and
still
less
whether
it
will
be
a
strong
or
a
weak
individual
phlegmatic
or
nervous
intelligent
or
not
he
can
only
tell
the
general
lines
of
the
future
evolution
of
that
individual
and
must
leave
it
to
time
to
show
the
exact
character
of
all
the
particular
details
of
its
personality
which
will
be
developed
naturally
and
spontaneously
in
conformity
with
the
hereditary
organic
conditions
and
the
conditions
of
the
environment
in
which
it
will
live
this
is
what
can
be
and
what
must
be
the
reply
of
every
socialist
this
is
the
position
taken
by
bebel
in
the
german
in
his
reply
to
those
who
wish
to
know
at
the
present
time
what
all
the
details
of
the
future
state
will
be
and
who
skilfully
profiting
by
the
ingenuity
of
the
socialist
romancers
criticize
their
artificial
fantasies
which
are
true
in
their
general
outlines
but
arbitrary
in
their
details
it
would
have
been
just
the
same
thing
if
before
the
french
revolution
which
as
it
were
hatched
out
the
bourgeois
world
prepared
and
matured
during
the
previous
evolution
the
nobility
and
the
clergy
the
classes
then
in
power
had
asked
the
representatives
of
the
third
estate
bourgeois
by
birth
though
some
aristocrats
or
priests
embraced
the
cause
of
the
bourgeoisie
against
the
privileges
of
their
caste
as
the
marquis
de
mirabeau
and
the
abbé
sieyès
but
what
sort
of
a
world
will
this
new
world
of
yours
be
show
us
first
its
exact
plan
and
after
that
we
will
decide
the
third
estate
the
bourgeoisie
would
not
have
been
able
to
answer
this
question
because
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
foresee
what
the
human
society
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
to
be
but
this
did
not
prevent
the
bourgeois
revolution
from
taking
place
because
it
represented
the
next
natural
and
inevitable
phase
of
an
eternal
evolution
this
is
now
the
position
of
socialism
with
relation
to
the
bourgeois
world
and
if
this
bourgeois
world
born
only
about
a
century
ago
is
destined
to
have
a
much
shorter
historical
cycle
than
the
feudal
world
this
is
simply
because
the
marvelous
scientific
progress
of
the
nineteenth
century
has
increased
a
the
rapidity
of
life
in
time
and
has
nearly
annihilated
space
and
therefore
civilized
humanity
traverses
now
in
ten
years
the
same
road
that
it
took
in
the
middle
ages
a
century
or
two
to
travel
the
continuously
accelerated
velocity
of
human
evolution
is
also
one
of
the
laws
established
and
proved
by
modern
social
science
it
is
the
artificial
constructions
of
sentimental
socialism
which
have
given
birth
to
the
idea
correct
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
that
is
synonymous
with
it
is
evident
that
if
the
new
social
organization
is
not
the
spontaneous
form
naturally
produced
by
the
human
evolution
but
rather
an
artificial
construction
that
has
issued
complete
in
every
detail
from
the
brain
of
some
social
architect
the
latter
will
be
unable
to
avoid
regulating
the
new
social
machinery
by
an
infinite
number
of
rules
and
by
the
superior
authority
which
he
will
assign
to
a
controlling
intelligence
either
individual
or
collective
it
is
easy
to
understand
then
how
such
an
organization
gives
rise
in
its
opponents
who
see
in
the
individualist
world
only
the
advantages
of
liberty
and
who
forget
the
evils
which
so
copiously
flow
from
it
the
impression
of
a
system
of
monastic
or
military
discipline
another
contemporary
artificial
product
has
contributed
to
confirm
this
impression
at
bottom
it
does
not
differ
from
sentimental
or
utopian
socialism
and
as
liebknecht
said
at
the
socialist
congress
of
berlin
it
would
be
a
state
capitalism
which
would
join
political
slavery
to
economic
exploitation
state
socialism
is
a
symptom
of
the
irresistible
power
of
scientific
and
democratic
socialism
as
is
shown
by
the
famous
of
emperor
william
convoking
an
international
conference
to
solve
this
is
the
infantile
idea
of
the
decree
the
problems
of
labor
and
the
famous
encyclical
on
the
condition
of
labor
of
the
very
able
pope
leo
xiii
who
has
handled
the
subject
with
great
tact
and
cleverness
but
these
imperial
rescripts
and
these
papal
encyclicals
because
it
is
impossible
to
leap
over
or
suppress
the
phases
of
the
social
evolution
could
only
result
abortively
in
our
bourgeois
individualist
and
world
certainly
it
would
not
have
been
displeasing
to
this
bourgeois
world
to
see
the
vigorous
contemporary
socialism
strangled
to
death
in
the
amorous
embraces
of
official
artificiality
and
of
state
socialism
for
it
had
become
evident
in
germany
and
elsewhere
that
neither
laws
nor
repressive
measures
of
any
kind
could
kill
it
all
that
arsenal
of
rules
and
regulations
and
provisions
for
inspection
and
superintendence
has
nothing
in
common
with
scientific
socialism
which
foresees
clearly
that
the
executive
guidance
of
the
new
social
organization
will
be
no
more
confused
than
is
the
present
administration
of
the
state
the
provinces
and
the
communes
and
will
on
the
contrary
be
much
better
adapted
to
subserve
the
interests
of
both
society
and
the
individual
since
it
will
be
a
natural
product
and
not
a
parasitic
product
of
the
new
social
organization
just
so
the
nervous
system
of
a
mammal
is
the
regulating
apparatus
of
its
organism
it
is
certainly
more
complex
than
that
of
the
organism
of
a
fish
or
of
a
mollusc
but
it
has
not
for
that
reason
tyrannically
stifled
the
autonomy
of
the
other
organs
and
anatomical
machinery
or
of
the
cells
in
their
living
confederation
it
is
understood
then
that
to
refute
socialism
something
more
is
needed
than
the
mere
repetition
of
the
current
objections
against
that
artificial
and
sentimental
socialism
which
still
continues
to
exist
i
confess
in
the
nebulous
mass
of
popular
ideas
but
every
day
it
is
losing
ground
before
the
intelligent
partisans
workingmen
or
aristocrats
of
scientific
socialism
which
armed
thanks
to
the
impulse
received
from
the
genius
of
marx
with
all
the
inductions
of
modern
science
is
triumphing
over
the
old
objections
which
our
adversaries
through
force
of
mental
custom
still
repeat
but
which
have
long
been
left
behind
by
contemporary
thought
together
with
the
utopian
socialism
which
provoked
them
the
same
reply
must
be
made
to
the
second
part
of
the
objection
with
regard
to
the
mode
by
which
the
advent
of
socialism
will
be
accomplished
one
of
the
inevitable
and
logical
consequences
of
utopian
and
artificial
socialism
is
to
think
that
the
architectonic
construction
proposed
by
such
or
such
a
reformer
ought
to
be
and
can
be
put
into
practice
in
a
single
day
by
a
decree
in
this
sense
it
is
quite
true
that
the
utopian
illusion
of
empirical
socialism
is
in
opposition
to
the
scientific
law
of
evolution
and
at
in
this
i
combatted
it
in
my
book
on
e
because
at
that
time
the
ideas
of
scientific
or
marxian
socialism
were
not
yet
generally
disseminated
in
italy
a
political
party
or
a
scientific
theory
are
natural
products
which
must
pass
through
the
vital
phases
of
infancy
and
youth
before
reaching
complete
development
it
was
then
inevitable
that
before
becoming
scientific
or
socialism
in
italy
as
in
other
countries
should
pass
through
the
infantile
phases
of
clannish
exclusiveness
the
era
when
socialism
was
confined
to
organizations
of
laborers
and
of
nebulous
romanticism
which
as
it
gives
to
the
word
a
narrow
and
incomplete
meaning
is
always
fed
with
false
hope
by
the
illusion
that
a
social
organism
can
be
radically
changed
in
a
single
day
with
four
just
as
a
monarchical
regime
could
thus
be
converted
into
a
republican
regime
but
it
is
infinitely
easier
to
change
the
political
envelope
of
a
social
organization
because
such
a
change
has
little
effect
on
the
economic
foundation
of
the
social
life
than
to
completely
revolutionize
this
social
life
in
its
economic
constitution
the
processes
of
social
transformation
as
well
as
under
various
names
those
of
every
sort
of
transformation
in
living
organisms
are
evolution
revolution
rebellion
individual
violence
a
mineral
or
vegetable
or
animal
species
may
pass
through
during
the
cycle
of
its
existence
these
four
processes
as
long
as
the
structure
and
the
volume
of
the
centre
of
crystallization
the
germ
or
the
embryo
increase
gradually
we
have
a
gradual
and
continuous
process
of
which
must
be
followed
at
a
definite
stage
by
a
process
of
more
or
less
prolonged
represented
for
example
by
the
separation
of
the
entire
crystal
from
the
mineral
mass
which
surrounds
it
or
by
certain
revolutionary
phases
of
vegetable
or
animal
life
as
for
example
the
moment
of
sexual
reproduction
there
may
also
be
a
period
of
that
is
to
say
of
organized
personal
violence
a
frequent
and
phenomenon
among
those
species
of
animals
who
live
in
societies
there
may
also
be
isolated
instances
of
as
in
the
struggles
to
obtain
food
or
for
possession
of
the
females
between
animals
of
the
same
species
these
same
processes
also
occur
in
the
human
world
by
must
be
understood
the
transformation
that
takes
place
day
by
day
which
is
almost
unnoticed
but
continuous
and
inevitable
by
the
critical
and
decisive
period
more
or
less
prolonged
of
an
evolution
that
has
reached
its
concluding
phase
by
the
partially
collective
violence
which
breaks
out
upon
the
occasion
of
some
particular
circumstance
at
a
definite
place
and
time
and
by
the
action
of
one
individual
against
one
or
several
others
which
may
be
the
effect
of
a
fanatical
passion
or
of
criminal
instincts
or
the
manifestation
of
a
lack
of
mental
equilibrium
and
which
identifies
itself
with
the
political
or
religious
ideas
most
in
vogue
at
the
moment
it
must
be
remarked
in
the
first
place
that
while
revolution
and
evolution
are
normal
functions
of
social
physiology
rebellion
and
individual
violence
are
symptoms
of
social
pathology
these
are
nevertheless
merely
natural
and
spontaneous
processes
since
as
virchow
has
shown
pathology
is
merely
the
sequel
of
normal
physiology
besides
the
pathological
symptoms
have
or
should
have
a
great
diagnostical
value
for
the
classes
in
power
but
the
latter
unfortunately
in
every
period
of
history
in
times
of
political
crisis
as
in
those
of
social
crisis
have
shown
themselves
unable
to
conceive
of
any
other
remedy
than
brutal
repression
the
guillotine
or
the
prison
and
they
fancy
that
thus
they
can
cure
the
organic
and
constitutional
disease
which
vexes
the
social
body
but
it
is
indisputable
at
all
events
that
the
normal
processes
of
social
transformation
and
because
they
are
normal
the
most
fruitful
and
the
surest
although
the
slowest
and
the
least
effective
in
appearance
are
evolution
and
revolution
using
the
latter
term
in
its
accurate
and
scientific
sense
as
the
concluding
phase
of
an
evolution
and
not
in
the
current
and
incorrect
sense
of
a
stormy
and
violent
revolt
it
is
evident
in
fact
that
europe
and
america
are
in
these
closing
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
a
period
of
revolution
prepared
by
the
evolution
begotten
by
the
bourgeois
organization
itself
and
promoted
by
utopian
socialism
as
well
as
by
scientific
socialism
likewise
we
are
in
that
period
of
social
life
which
bagehot
calls
the
age
of
discussion
and
already
we
can
see
what
zola
has
called
in
the
cracking
of
the
crust
and
in
fact
all
those
symptoms
which
taine
has
described
in
his
in
relating
the
history
of
the
twenty
years
which
preceded
as
repressive
methods
are
of
no
avail
against
domestic
revolution
and
only
serve
to
expose
the
symptoms
there
can
be
nothing
efficacious
and
productive
of
good
results
except
laws
of
social
reform
and
preparation
which
while
the
present
society
will
render
less
painful
as
marx
said
the
birth
of
the
new
society
in
this
sense
evolution
and
revolution
constitute
the
most
fruitful
and
surest
processes
of
social
metamorphosis
as
human
society
forms
a
natural
and
living
organism
like
all
other
organisms
it
can
not
endure
sudden
transformations
as
those
imagine
who
think
that
recourse
must
be
had
only
or
by
preference
to
rebellion
or
personal
violence
to
inaugurate
a
new
social
organization
this
seems
to
me
like
imagining
that
a
child
or
a
youth
could
in
a
single
day
accomplish
a
biological
evolution
and
become
forthwith
an
adult
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
a
man
out
of
work
in
the
horrors
of
starvation
his
brain
giving
way
for
want
of
nourishment
may
fancy
that
by
giving
a
policeman
a
blow
with
his
fist
by
throwing
a
bomb
by
raising
a
barricade
or
by
taking
part
in
a
riot
he
is
hastening
the
realization
of
a
social
ideal
from
which
injustice
will
have
vanished
and
even
apart
from
such
cases
it
is
possible
to
understand
how
the
power
of
impulsive
feeling
the
dominant
factor
in
some
natures
may
through
a
generous
impatience
lead
them
to
make
some
real
attempt
and
not
imaginary
like
those
which
the
police
in
all
times
and
all
countries
prosecute
in
the
courts
to
spread
terror
among
those
who
feel
the
political
or
economic
power
slipping
from
their
hands
but
scientific
socialism
especially
in
germany
under
the
direct
influence
of
marxism
has
completely
abandoned
those
old
methods
of
revolutionary
romanticism
though
they
have
often
been
employed
they
have
always
resulted
abortively
and
for
that
very
reason
the
ruling
classes
no
longer
dread
them
since
they
are
only
light
localized
assaults
on
a
fortress
which
still
has
more
than
sufficient
resistant
power
to
remain
victorious
and
by
this
victory
to
retard
temporarily
the
evolution
by
removing
from
the
scene
the
strongest
and
boldest
adversaries
of
the
marxian
socialism
is
revolutionary
in
the
scientific
meaning
of
the
word
and
it
is
now
developing
into
open
social
revolution
no
one
will
attempt
to
deny
i
think
that
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
marks
the
critical
phase
of
the
bourgeois
evolution
rushing
under
a
full
head
of
steam
even
in
italy
along
the
road
of
individualist
capitalism
marxian
socialism
has
the
candor
to
say
through
the
mouths
of
its
most
authoritative
spokesmen
to
the
great
suffering
host
of
the
modern
proletariat
that
it
has
no
magic
wand
to
transform
the
world
in
a
single
day
as
one
shifts
the
scenes
in
a
theatre
it
says
on
the
contrary
repeating
the
prophetic
exhortation
of
marx
of
all
countries
that
the
social
revolution
can
not
achieve
its
object
unless
it
first
becomes
a
vivid
fact
in
the
minds
of
the
workers
themselves
by
virtue
of
the
clear
perception
of
their
and
of
the
strength
which
their
union
will
give
them
and
that
they
will
not
wake
up
some
day
under
a
socialist
regime
because
divided
and
apathetic
for
days
out
of
the
year
they
shall
rebel
on
the
or
devote
themselves
to
the
perpetration
of
some
deed
of
personal
violence
this
is
what
i
call
the
psychology
of
the
the
capital
prize
in
a
lottery
many
workingmen
imagine
in
fact
that
without
doing
anything
to
form
themselves
into
a
party
they
will
win
some
day
the
capital
prize
the
social
revolution
just
as
the
manna
is
said
to
have
come
down
from
heaven
to
feed
the
hebrews
scientific
socialism
has
pointed
out
that
the
transforming
power
decreases
as
we
descend
the
scale
from
one
process
to
another
that
of
revolution
being
less
than
that
of
evolution
and
that
of
rebellion
being
less
than
that
of
revolution
and
individual
violence
having
the
least
of
all
and
since
it
is
a
question
of
a
complete
transformation
and
consequently
in
its
juridical
political
and
ethical
organization
the
process
of
transformation
is
more
effective
and
better
adapted
to
the
purpose
in
proportion
as
its
character
predominates
over
its
character
the
individualist
parties
are
individualists
even
in
the
daily
struggle
socialism
on
the
contrary
is
collectivist
even
in
that
because
it
knows
that
the
present
organization
does
not
depend
upon
the
will
of
such
or
such
an
individual
but
upon
society
as
a
whole
and
this
is
also
one
reason
why
charity
however
generous
it
be
being
necessarily
personal
and
partial
can
not
be
a
remedy
for
the
social
and
thereby
collective
question
of
the
distribution
of
wealth
in
political
questions
which
leave
the
foundation
untouched
it
is
possible
to
understand
how
for
instance
the
exile
of
napoleon
iii
or
of
the
emperor
don
pedro
could
inaugurate
a
republic
but
this
transformation
does
not
extend
to
the
foundation
of
the
social
life
and
the
german
empire
or
the
italian
monarchy
are
socially
bourgeois
just
the
same
as
the
french
republic
or
the
north
american
republic
because
notwithstanding
the
differences
between
them
they
all
belong
to
the
same
phase
this
is
why
the
processes
of
evolution
and
revolution
the
only
wholly
social
or
collective
processes
are
the
most
efficacious
while
partial
rebellion
and
still
more
individual
violence
have
only
a
very
feeble
power
of
social
transformation
they
are
moreover
and
because
they
the
primitive
savage
instincts
and
because
they
deny
in
the
very
whom
they
strike
down
the
principle
with
which
they
believe
themselves
animated
the
principle
of
respect
for
human
life
and
of
solidarity
what
is
the
use
of
hypnotizing
oneself
with
phrases
about
the
propaganda
of
the
deed
and
immediate
action
it
is
known
that
anarchists
individualists
amorphists
and
libertarians
admit
as
a
means
of
social
transformation
which
extends
from
homicide
to
theft
or
even
among
companions
and
this
is
then
merely
a
political
coloring
given
to
criminal
instincts
which
must
not
be
confounded
with
political
fanaticism
which
is
a
very
different
phenomenon
common
to
the
extreme
and
romantic
parties
of
all
times
a
scientific
examination
of
each
case
by
itself
with
the
aid
of
anthropology
and
psychology
alone
can
decide
whether
the
perpetrator
of
such
or
such
a
deed
of
violence
is
a
congenital
criminal
a
criminal
through
insanity
or
a
criminal
through
stress
of
political
fanaticism
i
have
in
fact
always
maintained
and
i
still
maintain
that
the
political
criminal
whom
some
wish
to
class
in
a
special
category
does
not
constitute
a
peculiar
anthropological
variety
but
that
he
can
be
placed
under
one
or
another
of
the
anthropological
categories
of
criminals
of
ordinary
law
and
particularly
one
of
these
three
the
criminal
having
a
congenital
tendency
to
crime
the
the
criminal
by
stress
of
fanatical
the
history
of
the
past
and
of
these
latter
times
afford
us
obvious
illustrations
of
these
several
categories
in
the
middle
ages
religious
beliefs
filled
the
minds
of
all
and
colored
the
criminal
or
insane
excesses
of
many
of
the
unbalanced
a
similar
insanity
was
the
efficient
cause
of
the
more
or
less
hysterical
sanctity
of
some
of
the
saints
at
the
close
of
our
century
it
is
the
questions
which
absorb
and
with
what
overwhelming
interest
the
universal
consciousness
which
is
stimulated
by
that
universal
contagion
created
by
journalism
with
its
great
sensationalism
and
these
are
the
questions
which
color
the
criminal
or
insane
excesses
of
many
of
the
unbalanced
or
which
are
the
determining
causes
of
instances
of
fanaticism
occurring
in
men
who
are
thoroughly
honorable
but
afflicted
with
excessive
sensibility
it
is
the
most
extreme
form
of
these
questions
which
in
each
historical
period
possesses
the
most
intense
suggestive
power
in
italy
sixty
years
ago
it
was
or
twenty
years
ago
it
was
now
it
is
it
is
very
easy
to
understand
how
there
occurred
in
each
period
in
accordance
with
their
respective
dominant
tendencies
deeds
of
personal
violence
felice
orsini
for
example
is
one
of
the
martyrs
of
the
italian
revolution
in
each
case
of
individual
violence
unless
one
is
content
with
the
necessarily
erroneous
judgments
begotten
by
emotion
to
reach
a
correct
decision
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
examination
of
the
perpetrator
just
as
it
is
in
the
case
of
any
other
crime
felice
orsini
was
a
political
criminal
through
among
the
anarchist
or
assassins
of
our
day
may
be
found
the
born
criminal
who
simply
colors
his
congenital
lack
of
the
moral
or
social
sense
with
a
political
varnish
the
or
mattoid
whose
mental
deficiency
becomes
blended
with
the
political
ideas
of
the
period
and
also
the
criminal
through
political
acting
from
sincere
conviction
and
mentally
almost
normal
in
whom
the
criminal
action
is
determined
or
caused
solely
by
the
false
idea
which
socialism
combats
of
the
possibility
of
effecting
a
transformation
by
means
of
violence
but
no
matter
whether
the
particular
crime
is
that
of
a
congenital
criminal
or
of
a
madman
or
of
a
political
criminal
through
passion
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
personal
violence
as
adopted
by
the
anarchist
individualists
is
simply
the
logical
product
of
individualism
carried
to
extremes
and
therefore
the
natural
product
of
the
existing
economic
organization
though
its
production
is
also
favored
by
the
delirium
of
hunger
acute
or
chronic
but
it
is
also
the
least
efficacious
and
the
most
means
of
social
transformation
but
all
anarchists
are
not
individualists
or
autonomists
there
are
also
the
latter
repudiates
deeds
of
as
ordinary
means
of
social
transformation
merlino
for
example
has
recently
stated
this
in
his
pamphlet
e
base
di
un
prato
but
even
these
cut
themselves
off
from
marxian
socialism
both
by
their
ultimate
and
more
especially
by
their
of
social
transformation
they
combat
marxian
socialism
because
it
is
and
and
they
contend
that
the
most
efficacious
and
the
surest
mode
of
social
transformation
is
these
assertions
which
respond
to
the
vagueness
of
the
sentiments
and
ideas
of
too
large
a
portion
of
the
and
to
the
impatience
provoked
by
their
wretched
condition
may
meet
with
a
temporary
unintelligent
approval
but
their
effect
can
be
only
ephemeral
the
explosion
of
a
bomb
may
indeed
give
birth
to
a
momentary
emotion
but
it
can
not
advance
by
the
hundredth
part
of
an
inch
the
evolution
in
men
minds
toward
socialism
while
it
causes
a
reaction
in
feeling
a
reaction
in
part
sincere
but
skilfully
fomented
and
exploited
as
a
pretext
for
repression
to
say
to
the
laborers
that
without
having
made
ready
the
requisite
material
means
but
especially
without
solidarity
and
without
an
intelligent
conception
of
the
goal
and
without
a
high
moral
purpose
they
ought
to
rise
against
the
classes
in
power
is
really
to
play
into
the
hands
of
those
very
classes
since
the
latter
are
sure
of
the
material
victory
when
the
evolution
is
not
ripe
and
the
revolution
is
not
ready
and
so
it
has
been
possible
to
show
in
the
case
of
the
late
sicilian
rebellion
in
spite
of
all
the
lies
of
those
interested
in
hiding
the
truth
that
in
those
districts
where
socialism
was
most
advanced
and
best
understood
there
were
no
deeds
of
personal
violence
no
revolts
as
for
example
among
the
peasants
of
piana
dei
greci
of
whom
nicola
barbato
had
made
intelligent
socialists
while
those
convulsive
movements
occurred
outside
of
the
field
of
the
socialist
propaganda
as
a
rebellion
against
the
exactions
of
the
local
governments
and
of
the
or
in
those
districts
where
the
socialist
propaganda
was
less
intelligent
and
was
stifled
by
the
fierce
passions
caused
by
hunger
and
misery
history
demonstrates
that
the
countries
where
revolts
have
been
the
most
frequent
are
those
in
which
social
progress
is
the
least
advanced
the
popular
energies
exhaust
and
destroy
themselves
in
these
feverish
convulsive
excesses
which
alternate
with
periods
of
discouragement
and
despair
which
are
the
fitting
environment
of
the
buddhist
theory
of
a
very
convenient
theory
for
the
conservative
parties
in
such
countries
we
never
see
that
continuity
of
premeditated
action
slower
and
less
effective
in
appearance
but
in
reality
the
only
kind
of
action
that
can
accomplish
those
things
which
appear
to
us
as
the
miracles
of
history
therefore
marxian
socialism
in
all
countries
has
proclaimed
that
from
this
time
forth
the
principal
means
of
social
transformation
must
be
conquest
of
the
public
in
local
administrations
as
well
as
in
national
parliaments
as
one
of
the
results
of
the
organization
of
the
laborers
into
a
party
the
further
the
political
organization
of
the
laborers
in
civilized
countries
shall
progress
the
more
one
will
see
realized
by
a
resistless
evolution
the
socialist
organization
of
society
at
first
by
partial
concessions
but
ever
growing
more
important
wrested
from
the
capitalist
class
by
the
the
law
restricting
the
to
eight
hours
for
example
and
then
by
the
complete
transformation
of
individual
ownership
into
social
ownership
as
to
the
question
whether
this
complete
transformation
which
is
at
present
being
prepared
for
by
a
process
of
gradual
evolution
which
is
nearing
the
critical
and
decisive
period
of
the
social
revolution
can
be
accomplished
without
the
aid
of
other
means
of
transformation
such
as
rebellion
and
individual
violence
this
is
a
question
which
no
one
can
answer
in
advance
marxian
socialists
are
not
prophets
our
sincere
wish
is
that
the
social
revolution
when
its
evolution
shall
be
ripe
may
be
effected
peacefully
as
so
many
other
revolutions
have
been
without
like
the
english
revolution
which
preceded
by
a
century
with
its
of
the
french
revolution
like
the
italian
revolution
in
tuscany
in
like
the
brazilian
revolution
with
the
exile
of
the
emperor
dom
pedro
in
it
is
certain
that
socialism
by
spreading
education
and
culture
among
the
people
by
organizing
the
workers
into
a
party
under
its
banner
is
only
increasing
the
probability
of
the
fulfilment
of
our
hope
and
is
dissipating
the
old
forebodings
of
a
after
the
advent
of
socialism
which
were
indeed
justified
when
socialism
was
still
utopian
in
its
means
of
realization
instead
of
being
as
it
now
is
a
natural
and
spontaneous
and
therefore
inevitable
and
irrevocable
phase
of
the
evolution
of
humanity
where
will
this
social
revolution
start
i
am
firmly
convinced
that
if
the
latin
peoples
being
southerners
are
more
ready
for
revolt
which
may
suffice
for
purely
political
transformations
the
peoples
of
the
north
the
germans
and
are
better
prepared
for
the
tranquil
and
orderly
but
inexorable
process
of
the
true
revolution
understood
as
the
critical
phase
of
an
organic
incomplete
preparatory
evolution
which
is
the
only
effective
process
for
a
truly
social
transformation
it
is
in
germany
and
england
where
the
greater
development
of
bourgeois
industrialism
inevitably
aggravates
its
detrimental
consequences
and
thereby
magnifies
the
necessity
for
socialism
that
the
great
social
metamorphosis
will
perhaps
being
though
indeed
it
has
begun
everywhere
and
from
there
it
will
spread
across
old
europe
just
as
at
the
close
of
the
last
century
the
signal
for
the
political
and
bourgeois
revolution
was
raised
by
france
however
this
may
be
we
have
just
demonstrated
once
more
the
profound
difference
there
is
between
socialism
and
anarchism
which
our
opponents
and
the
servile
press
endeavor
to
confound
and
at
all
events
i
have
demonstrated
that
marxian
socialism
is
in
harmony
with
modern
science
and
is
its
logical
continuation
that
is
exactly
the
reason
why
it
has
made
the
theory
of
evolution
the
basis
of
its
inductions
and
why
it
thus
marks
the
truly
living
and
final
phase
and
therefore
the
only
phase
recognized
by
the
intelligence
of
the
collectivist
democracy
of
socialism
which
had
theretofore
remained
floating
in
the
nebulosities
of
sentiment
and
why
it
has
taken
as
its
guide
the
unerring
compass
of
scientific
thought
rejuvenated
by
the
works
of
darwin
and
spencer
footnotes
we
have
a
typical
example
of
this
in
the
new
italian
penal
code
which
as
i
said
before
its
enforcement
shows
no
signs
of
special
adaptation
to
italian
conditions
it
might
just
as
well
be
a
code
made
for
greece
or
norway
and
it
has
borrowed
from
the
countries
of
the
north
the
system
of
confinement
in
cells
which
even
then
in
the
north
was
recognized
in
all
its
costly
absurdity
as
a
system
devised

may

the

may
be

from
another

the

completely
forget

the
first
the
death
of
the
second
death
of
although
the
death
of
an
honorable
man
like
carnot
may
be
regretted
it
is
not
to
be
compared
to
the
mass
of
human
sufferings
misery
and
woe
which
fell
upon
these
equally
innocent
as
he
it
will
be
said
it
is
true
that
the
murder
of
carnot
was
the
act
of
a
fanatic
while
no
one
directly
killed
these
miners
and
certainly
this
is
a
difference
but
it
must
be
remarked
that
if
the
death
of
these
miners
is
not
the
voluntary
work
of
any
one
it
is
a
result
of
individual
capitalism
which
to
swell
its
revenues
reduces
expenses
to
the
lowest
possible
point
does
not
curtail
the
hours
of
labor
and
does
not
take
all
the
measures
indicated

sometimes
even
enjoined
by

the
sterility
of

one
of
the
strangest
facts
in
the
history
of
the
scientific
thought
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
that
though
the
profound
scientific
revolution
caused
by
darwinism
and
spencerian
evolution
has
reinvigorated
with
new
youth
all
the
physical
biological
and
even
psychological
sciences
when
it
reached
the
domain
of
the
social
sciences
it
only
superficially
rippled
the
tranquil
and
orthodox
surface
of
the
lake
of
that
social
science
political
economy
it
has
led
it
is
true
through
the
initiative
of
auguste
comte
whose
name
has
been
somewhat
obscured
by
those
of
darwin
and
spencer
but
who
was
certainly
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
prolific
geniuses
of
our
age
to
the
creation
of
a
new
science
which
should
be
together
with
the
natural
history
of
human
societies
the
crowning
glory
of
the
new
scientific
edifice
erected
by
the
experimental
method
i
do
not
deny
that
sociology
in
the
department
of
purely
descriptive
anatomy
of
the
social
organism
has
made
great
and
fruitful
new
contributions
to
contemporary
science
even
developing
into
some
specialized
branches
of
sociology
of
which
thanks
to
the
labors
of
the
italian
school
has
become
one
of
the
most
important
results
but
when
the
question
is
entered
upon
the
new
science
of
sociology
is
overpowered
by
a
sort
of
hypnotic
sleep
and
remains
suspended
in
a
sterile
colorless
limbo
thus
permitting
sociologists
to
be
in
public
economy
as
in
politics
conservatives
or
radicals
in
accordance
with
their
respective
whims
or
subjective
tendencies
and
while
darwinian
biology
by
the
scientific
determination
of
the
relations
between
the
individual
and
the
species
and
evolutionist
sociology
itself
by
describing
in
human
society
the
organs
and
the
functions
of
a
new
organism
was
making
the
individual
a
cell
in
the
animal
organism
herbert
spencer
was
loudly
proclaiming
his
english
individualism
extending
to
the
most
absolute
theoretical
anarchism
a
period
of
stagnation
was
inevitable
in
the
scientific
productive
activity
of
sociology
after
the
first
original
observations
in
descriptive
social
anatomy
and
in
the
natural
history
of
human
societies
sociology
represented
thus
a
sort
of
arrested
development
in
experimental
scientific
thought
because
those
who
cultivated
it
wittingly
or
unwittingly
recoiled
before
the
logical
and
radical
conclusions
that
the
modern
scientific
revolution
was
destined
to
establish
in
the
social
domain
the
most
important
domain
of
all
if
science
was
to
become
the
handmaid
of
life
instead
of
contenting
itself
with
that
barren
formula
science
for
the
sake
of
science
the
secret
of
this
strange
phenomenon
consists
not
only
in
the
fact
that
as
malagodi
said
sociology
is
still
in
the
period
of
scientific
and
not
yet
in
that
of
but
especially
in
the
fact
that
the
logical
consequences
of
darwinism
and
of
scientific
evolutionism
applied
to
the
study
of
human
society
lead
inexorably
to
socialism
as
i
have
demonstrated

is
due
the
honor
of
having
scientifically
formulated
these
logical
applications
of
experiential

to
the
domain
of

beyond
doubt
the
exposition
of
these

is
surrounded
in

with
a
multitude
of
technical
details
and
of
apparently
dogmatic
formulæ

a

effort
was
made

consign
by

the
masterly
work
of
marx
to
oblivion
but
now
his
name
is
coming
to
rank
with
those
of
charles
darwin
and
herbert
spencer
as
the
three
titans
of
the
scientific
revolution
which
begot
the
intellectual
renaissance
and
gave
fresh
potency
to
the
civilizing
thought
of
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
ideas
by
which
the
genius
of
karl
marx
completed
in
the
domain
of
social
economy
the
revolution
effected
by
science
are
in
number
three
the
first
is
the
discovery
of
the
law
of
this
law
gives
us
a
scientific
explanation
of
the
accumulation
of
private
property
not
created
by
the
labor
of
the
accumulator
as
this
law
has
a
more
peculiarly
technical
character
we
will
not
lay
further
stress
upon
it
here
as
we
have
given
a
general
idea
of
it
in
the
preceding
pages
the
two
other
marxian
theories
are
more
directly
related
to
our
observations
on
scientific
socialism
since
they
undoubtedly
furnish
us
the
sure
and
infallible
key
to
the
life
of
society
i
allude
first
to
the
idea
expressed
by
marx
as
long
ago
as
in
his
de
that
the
economic
phenomena
form
the
foundation
and
the
determining
conditions
of
all
other
human
or
social
manifestations
and
that
consequently
ethics
law
and
politics
are
only
derivative
phenomena
determined
by
the
economic
factor
in
accordance
with
the
conditions
of
each
particular
people
in
every
phase
of
history
and
under
all
climatic
conditions
this
idea
which
corresponds
to
that
great
biological
law
which
states
the
dependence
of
the
function
on
the
nature
and
capacities
of
the
organ
and
which
makes
each
individual
the
result
of
the
innate
and
acquired
conditions
of
his
physiological
organism
living
in
a
given
environment
so
that
a
biological
application
may
be
given
to
the
famous
saying
tell
me
what
you
eat
and
i
will
tell
you
what
you
are
this
sublime
idea
which
unfolds
before
our
eyes
the
majestic
drama
of
history
no
longer
as
the
arbitrary
succession
of
great
men
on
the
stage
of
the
social
theatre
but
rather
as
the
resultant
of
the
economic
conditions
of
each
people
this
sublime
idea
after
having
been
partially
applied
by
thorold
rogers
has
been
so
brilliantly
expounded
and
illustrated
by
achille
loria
that
i
believe
it
unnecessary
to
say
anything
more
about
it
one
idea
however
still
appears
to
me
necessary
to
complete
this
marxian
theory
as
i
remarked
in
the
first
edition
of
my
book
e
it
is
necessary
indeed
to
rid
this
impregnable
theory
of
that
species
of
narrow
dogmatism
with
which
it
is
clothed
in
marx
and
still
more
in
loria
it
is
perfectly
true
that
every
phenomenon
as
well
as
every
institution
moral
juridical
or
political
is
simply
the
result
of
the
economic
phenomena
and
conditions
of
the
transitory
physical
and
historical
environment
but
as
a
consequence
of
that
law
of
natural
causality
which
tells
us
that
every
effect
is
always
the
resultant
of
numerous
concurrent
causes
and
not
of
one
cause
alone
and
that
every
effect
becomes
in
its
turn
a
cause
of
other
phenomena
it
is
necessary
to
amend
and
complete
the
too
rigid
form
that
has
been
given
to
this
true
idea
just
as
all
the
psychical
manifestations
of
the
individual
are
the
resultant
of
the
organic
conditions
temperament
and
of
the
environment
in
which
he
lives
in
the
same
way
all
the
social
manifestations
moral
juridical
or
political
of
a
people
are
the
resultant
of
their
organic
conditions
race
and
of
the
environment
as
these
are
the
determining
causes
of
the
given
economic
organization
which
is
the
physical
basis
of
life
in
their
turn
the
individual
psychical
conditions
become
causes
and
effect
although
with
less
power
the
individual
organic
conditions
and
the
issue
of
the
struggle
for
life
in
the
same
way
the
moral
juridical
and
political
institutions
from
effects
become
causes
there
is
in
fact
for
modern
science
no
difference
between
cause
and
effect
except
that
the
effect
is
always
the
latter
of
two
related
phenomena
and
the
cause
always
the
former
and
react
in
their
turn
although
with
less
efficacy
on
the
economic
conditions
an
individual
who
has
studied
the
laws
of
hygiene
may
influence
beneficently
for
instance
the
imperfections
of
his
digestive
apparatus
but
always
within
the
very
narrow
limits
of
his
organic
capacities
a
scientific
discovery
an
electoral
law
may
have
an
effect
on
industry
or
on
the
conditions
of
labor
but
always
within
limits
fixed
by
the
framework
of
the
fundamental
economic
organization
this
is
why
moral
juridical
and
political
institutions
have
a
greater
influence
on
the
relations
between
the
various
subdivisions
of
the
class
controlling
the
economic
power
capitalists
industrial
magnates
landed
proprietors
than
on
the
relations
between
the
capitalist
on
the
one
side
and
the
toilers
on
the
other
it
suffices
here
for
me
to
have
mentioned
this
marxian
law
and
i
will
refer
to
the
suggestive
book
of
achille
loria
the
reader
who
desires
to
see
how
this
law
scientifically
explains
all
the
phenomena
from
the
most
trivial
to
the
most
imposing
of
the
social
life
this
law
is
truly
the
most
scientific
and
the
most
prolific
sociological
theory
that
has
ever
been
discovered
by
the
genius
of
man
it
furnishes
as
i
have
already
remarked
a
scientific
physiological
experiential
explanation
of
social
history
in
the
most
magnificent
dramas
as
well
as
of
personal
history
in
its
most
trivial
episodes
on
explanation
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
entire
trend
which
has
been
described
as
materialistic
of
modern
scientific
thought
if
we
leave
out
of
consideration
the
two
unscientific
explanations
of
free
will
and
divine
providence
we
find
that
two
and
therefore
incomplete
although
correct
and
scientific
explanations
of
human
history
have
been
given
i
refer
to
the
of
montesquieu
buckle
and
metschnikoff
and
to
the
of
the
ethnologists
who
find
the
explanation
of
the
events
of
history
in
the
organic
and
psychical
characteristics
of
the
various
races
of
men
karl
marx
sums
up
combines
and
completes
these
two
theories
by
his
the
economic
conditions
which
are
the
resultant
of
the
energies
and
aptitudes
acting
in
a
given
environment
are
the
determining
basis
of
all
the
moral
juridical
and
political
phenomenal
manifestations
of
human
life
both
individual
and
social
this
is
the
sublime
conception
the
and
scientific
marxian
theory
which
fears
no
criticism
resting
as
it
does
on
the
best
established
results
of
geology
and
biology
of
psychology
and
sociology
it
is
thanks
to
it
that
students
of
the
philosophy
of
law
and
sociology
are
able
to
determine
the
true
nature
and
functions
of
the
which
as
it
is
nothing
but
society
juridically
and
politically
organized
is
only
the
secular
arm
used
by
the
class
in
possession
of
the
economic
power
and
consequently
of
the
political
juridical
and
administrative
power
to
preserve
their
own
special
privileges
and
to
postpone
as
long
as
possible
the
evil
day
when
they
must
surrender
them
the
other
sociological
theory
by
which
karl
marx
has
truly
dissipated
the
clouds
which
had
ere
then
darkened
the
sky
of
the
aspirations
of
socialism
and
which
has
supplied
scientific
socialism
with
a
political
compass
by
the
use
of
which
it
can
guide
its
course
with
complete
confidence
and
certainty
in
the
struggles
of

the
moral
juridical
and
political
phenomena
it
is
evident
that
every
social
group
every
individual
will
be
led
to
act
in
accordance
with
its
or
his
economic
interest
because
the
latter
is
the
physical
basis
of
life
and
the
essential
condition
of
all
other
development
in
the
political
sphere
each
social
class
will
be
inclined
to
pass
laws
to
establish
institutions
and
to
perpetuate
customs
and
beliefs
which
directly
or
indirectly
subserve
its
interests
these
laws
these
institutions
these
beliefs
handed
down
by
inheritance
or
tradition
finally
obscure
or
conceal
their
economic
origin
and
philosophers
and
jurists
and
often
even
the
laity
defend
them
as
truths
subsisting
by
virtue
of
their
own
intrinsic
merits
without
seeing
their
real
source
but
the
latter
the
economic
is
none
the
less
the
only
scientific
explanation
of
these
laws
institutions
and
beliefs
and
in
this
fact
consists
the
greatness
and
strength
of
the
perspicacious
conception
of
the
genius
of
marx
as
in
the
modern
world
there
are
now
but
two
classes
with
subordinate
varieties
on
the
one
side
the
workers
to
whatever
category
they
belong
and
on
the
other
the
property
owners
who
do
not
work
the
socialist
theory
of
marx
leads
us
to
this
evident
conclusion
since
political
parties
are
merely
the
echoes
and
the
of
class
interests
no
matter
what
the
subvarieties
of
these
classes
may
be
there
can
be
substantially
only
two
political
parties
the
socialist
labor
party
and
the
individualist
party
of
the
class
in
possession
of
the
land
and
the
other
means
of
production
the
difference
in
the
character
of
the
economic
monopoly
may
cause
it
is
true
a
certain
diversity
of
political
and
i
have
always
contended
that
the
great
landed
proprietors
represent
the
conservative
tendencies
of
political
stagnation
while
the
holders
of
financial
or
industrial
capital
represent
in
many
instances
the
progressive
party
driven
by
its
own
nature
to
petty
innovations
of
form
while
finally
those
who
possess
only
an
intellectual
capital
the
liberal
professions
may
go
to
the
extreme
length
of
political
radicalism
on
the
vital
question
that
is
to
say
on
the
economic
question
of
property
conservatives
progressives
and
radicals
are
all
individualists
on
this
point
they
are
all
in
their
essential
nature
of
the
same
social
class
and
in
spite
of
certain
sentimental
sympathies
the
adversaries
of
the
working
class
and
of
those
who
although
born
on
other
have
embraced
the
political
programme
of
that
class
a
programme
necessarily
corresponding
to
the
primordial
economic
necessity
that
is
to
say
the
socialization
of
the
land
and
the
means
of
production
with
all
the
innumerable
and
radical
moral
juridical
and
political
transformations
which
this
socialization
will
inevitably
bring
to
pass
in
the
social
world
this
is
why
contemporary
political
life
can
not
but
degenerate
into
the
most
sterile
and
the
most
corrupt
strife
for
bribes
and
spoils
when
it
is
confined
to
the
superficial
skirmishes
between
individualist
parties
which
differ
only
by
a
shade
and
in
their
formal
names
but
whose
ideas
are
so
similar
that
one
often
sees
radicals
and
progressives
less
modern
than
many
conservatives
there
will
be
a
new
birth
of
political
life
only
with
the
development
of
the
socialist
party
because
after
the
disappearance
from
the
political
stage
of
the
historical
figures
of
the
patriots
the
founders
of
modern
italy
and
of
the
personal
reasons
which
split
up
the
representatives
into
different
political
groups
the
formation
of
one
single
individualist
party
will
become
necessary
as
i
declared
in
the
italian
chamber
on
the
of
december
the
historical
duel
will
then
be
begun
and
the
class
struggle
will
then
display
on
the
field
of
politics
all
its
beneficent
influence
beneficent
i
say
because
the
class
struggle
must
be
understood
not
in
the
contemptible
sense
of
a
saturnalia
of
and
outrages
of
malevolence
and
personal
violence
but
must
be
worthily
conceived
as
a
great
social
drama
with
all
my
heart
i
hope
that
this
conflict
may
be
settled
for
the
progress
of
civilization
without
bloody
convulsions
but
historical
destiny
has
decreed
the
conflict
and
it
is
not
given
to
us
or
to
others
to
avert
or
postpone
it
it
follows
from
all
that
we
have
just
said
that
these
ideas
of
political
socialism
because
they
are
scientific
dispose
their
partisans
both
to
and
to
this
is
also
a
conclusion
reached
by
experimental
psychology
in
the
domain
of
philosophy
however
great
our
personal
sympathies
may
be
for
such
or
such
a
representative
of
the
radical
faction
of
the
individualist
party
as
well
as
for
every
honorable
and
sincere
representative
of
any
scientific
religious
or
political
opinion
whatsoever
we
are
bound
to
recognize
that
there
are
on
the
side
of
socialism
no
it
is
necessary
to
be
on
one
side
or
the
other
individualist
or
socialist
there
is
no
middle
ground
and
i
am
constantly
growing
more
and
more
convinced
that
the
only
serviceable
tactics
for
the
formation
of
a
socialist
party
likely
to
live
is
precisely
that
policy
of
theoretical
inflexibility
and
of
refusing
to
enter
into
any
alliance
with
as
such
an
alliance
is
for
socialism
only
a
false
placenta
for
a
fetus
that
is
unlikely
to
live
the
conservative
and
the
socialist
are
the
natural
products
of
the
individual
character
and
the
social
environment
one
is
born
a
conservative
or
an
innovator
just
as
one
is
born
a
painter
or
a
surgeon
therefore
the
socialists
have
no
contempt
for
or
bitterness
toward
the
sincere
representatives
of
any
faction
of
the
conservative
party
though
they
combat
their
ideas
unrelentingly
if
such
or
such
a
socialist
shows
himself
intolerant
if
he
abuses
his
opponents
this
is
because
he
is
the
victim
of
a
passing
emotion
or
of
an
temperament
it
is
therefore
very
excusable
the
thing
that
provokes
a
smile
of
pity
is
to
see
certain
conservatives
young
in
years
but
old
in
thought
for
conservatism
in
the
young
can
be
nothing
but
the
effect
of
calculating
selfishness
or
the
index
of
psychical
anemia
have
an
air
of
complacency
or
of
pity
for
socialists
whom
they
consider
at
best
as
misled
without
perceiving
that
what
is
normal
is
for
the
old
to
be
conservatives
but
that
young
conservatives
can
be
nothing
but
who
are
afraid
of
losing
the
life
of
idle
luxury
into
which
they
were
born
or
the
advantages
of
the
orthodox
fashion
of
dividing
the
fruits
of
labor
their
hearts
at
least
if
not
their
brains
are
abnormally
small
the
socialist
who
has
everything
to
lose
and
nothing
to
gain
by
boldly
declaring
his
position
and
principles
possesses
by
contrast
all
the
superiority
of
a
disinterested
altruism
especially
when
having
been
born
in
the
aristocratic
or
the
bourgeois
class
he
has
renounced
the
brilliant
pleasure
of
a
life
of
leisure
to
defend
the
cause
of
the
weak
and
the
oppressed
but
it
is
said
these
bourgeois
socialists
act
in
this
way
through
love
of
popularity
this
is
a
strange
form
of
selfishness
at
all
events
which
prefers
to
the
quickly
reaped
rewards
and
profits
of
bourgeois
individualism
the
socialist
idealism
of
popular
sympathy
especially
when
it
might
gain
this
sympathy
by
other
means
which
would
compromise
it
less
in
the
eyes
of
the
class
in
power
let
us
hope
in
concluding
that
when
the
bourgeoisie
shall
have
to
surrender
the
economic
power
and
the
political
power
in
order
that
they
may
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
all
in
the
new
society
and
that
as
berenini
recently
said
victors
and
vanquished
may
really
become
brothers
without
distinction
of
class
in
the
common
assured
enjoyment
of
a
mode
of
life
worthy
of
human
beings
let
us
hope
that
in
surrendering
power
the
bourgeoisie
will
do
it
with
that
dignity
and
which
the
aristocracy
showed
when
it
was
stripped
of
its
class
privileges
by
the
triumphant
bourgeoisie
at
the
time
of
the
french
revolution
it
is
the
truth
of
the
message
of
socialism
and
its
perfect
agreement
with
the
most
certain
inductions
of
experimental
science
which
explain
to
us
not
only
its
tremendous
growth
and
progress
which
could
not
be
merely
the
purely
negative
effect
of
a
material
and
moral
malady
rendered
acute
by
a
period
of
social
crisis
but
above
all
it
explains
to
us
that
unity
of
intelligent
disciplined
solidarity
which
presents
in
the
celebration
of
the
first
of
may
a
moral
phenomenon
of
such
grandeur
that
human
history
presents
no
parallel
example
if
we
except
the
movement
of
primitive
christianity
which
had
however
a
much
more
restricted
field
of
action
than
contemporary
socialism
henceforth
disregarding
the
hysterical
or
unreasoning
attempts
to
revert
from
bourgeois
scepticism
to
mysticism
as
a
safeguard
against
the
moral
and
material
crisis
of
the
present
time
attempts
which
make
us
think
of
those
lascivious
women
who
become
pious
bigots
on
growing
old
henceforth
both
partisans
and
adversaries
of
socialism
are
forced
to
recognize
the
fact
that
like
christianity
at
the
dissolution
of
the
roman
world
socialism
constitutes
the
only
force
which
restores
the
hope
of
a
better
future
to
the
old
and
disintegrating
human
society
a
hope
no
longer
begotten
by
a
faith
inspired
by
the
unreasoning
transports
of
sentiment

born
of
rational
confidence

that

proof
of
that
conspiracy
of
silence
about
the

it
suffices

me
to
point
out
that
the

generally
mention
only
the
technical

ignore
the
two
other

the

appendix
i
editor
etc
dear
sir
i
have
read
in
your
journal
a
letter
from
herbert
spencer
in
which
he
relying
on
indirect
information
conveyed
to
him
regarding
my
book
and
modern
expresses
his
astonishment
at
the
audacity
of
him
who
has
made
use
his
to
defend
socialism
permit
me
to
say
to
you
that
no
socialist
has
ever
dreamt
of
making
spencer
who
is
certainly
the
greatest
of
living
philosophers
pass
as
a
partisan
of
socialism
it
is
strange
indeed
that
anyone
could
have
been
able
to
make
him
believe
that
there
is
in
italy
enough
ignorance
among
writers
as
well
as
among
readers
for
one
to
misuse
so
grotesquely
the
name
of
herbert
spencer
whose
extreme
individualism
is
known
to
all
the
world
but
the
personal
opinion
of
herbert
spencer
is
a
quite
different
thing
from
the
logical
consequence
of
the
scientific
theories
concerning
universal
evolution
which
he
has
developed
more
fully
and
better
than
anyone
else
but
of
which
he
has
not
the
official
monopoly
and
whose
free
expansion
by
the
labor
of
other
thinkers
he
can
not
inhibit
i
myself
in
the
preface
of
my
book
pointed
out
that
spencer
and
darwin
stopped
on
the
road
to
the
logical
consequences
of
their
doctrines
but
i
also
demonstrated
that
these
very
doctrines
constituted
the
scientific
foundation
of
the
socialism
of
marx
the
only
one
who
by
rising
above
the
sentimental
socialism
of
former
days
has
arranged
in
a
systematic
and
orderly
fashion
the
facts
of
the
social
economy
and
by
induction
drawn
from
them
political
conclusions
in
support
of
the
revolutionary
method
of
tactics
as
a
means
of
approach
to
a
revolutionary
goal
as
regards
darwinism
being
unable
to
repeat
here
the
arguments
which
are
already
contained
in
my
book
and
which
will
be
more
fully
developed
in
the
second
edition
it
suffices
for
me
to
remind
you
since
it
has
been
thought
fit
to
resort
to
arguments
having
so
little
weight
as
appeals
to
the
authority
of
individuals
that
among
many
others
the
celebrated
virchow
foresaw
with
great
penetration
that
darwinism
would
lead
directly
to
socialism
and
let
me
remind
you
that
the
celebrated
wallace
darwinian
though
he
is
is
a
member
of
the
english
for
the
of
the
which
constitutes
one
of
the
fundamental
conclusions
of
socialism
and
from
another
point
of
view
what
is
the
famous
doctrine
of
which
marx
revealed
as
the
positive
key
of
human
history
but
the
darwinian
law
of
the
struggle
for
life
transformed
from
a
chaotic
strife
between
individuals
to
a
conflict
between
collectivities
just
the
same
as
every
individual
every
class
or
social
group
struggles
for
its
existence
and
just
as
the
bourgeoisie
struggled
against
the
clergy
and
the
aristocracy
and
triumphed
in
the
french
revolution
in
the
same
way
the
international
proletariat
struggles
and
not
by
the
use
of
violence
as
is
constantly
charged
against
us
but
by
propaganda
and
organization
for
its
economic
and
moral
existence
at
present
so
ill
assured
and
depressed
to
so
sadly
low
a
plane
as
regards
the
theory
of
evolution
how
can
any
one
not
see
that
it
most
flagrantly
contradicts
the
classical
theories
of
political
economy
which
looks
upon
the
basic
laws
of
the
existing
economic
organization
as
eternal
and
immutable
laws
socialism
on
the
contrary
maintains
that
the
economic
institutions
and
the
juridical
and
political
institutions
are
only
the
historical
product
of
their
particular
epoch
and
that
therefore
they
are
changing
since
they
are
in
a
state
of
continuous
evolution
which
causes
the
present
to
differ
from
the
past
just
as
the
future
will
be
different
from
the
present
herbert
spencer
believes
that
universal
evolution
dominates
over
all
orders
of
phenomena
with
the
exception
of
the
organization
of
property
which
he
declares
is
destined
to
exist
eternally
under
its
individualistic
form
the
socialists
on
the
contrary
believe
that
the
organization
of
property
will
inevitably
undergo
just
as
all
other
institutions
a
radical
transformation
and
taking
into
consideration
its
historical
transformations
they
show
that
the
economic
evolution
is
marching
and
will
march
faster
and
faster
as
a
consequence
of
the
increased
evils
of
individualist
concentration
toward
its
goal
the
complete
socialization
of
the
means
of
production
which
constitute
the
physical
basis
of
the
social
and
collective
life
and
which
must
not
and
can
not
therefore
remain
in
the
hands
of
a
few
individuals
between
these
two
doctrines
it
is
not
difficult
to
decide
which
is
the
more
in
harmony
with
the
scientific
theory
of
physical
and
social
evolution
in
any
case
with
all
the
respect
due
to
our
intellectual
father
herbert
spencer
but
also
with
all
the
pride
to
which
my
scientific
studies
and
conscience
give
me
the

ii
socialist

and
individualist
myopia
among
the
numerous
publications
which
for
or
against
socialism
have
appeared
in
italy
since
my
e
scienza
which
demonstrated
the
agreement
of
socialism
with
the
fundamental
lines
of
contemporary
scientific
thought
the
book
of
baron
garofalo
was
looked
forward
to
with
eager
interest
it
received
attention
both
because
of
the
fame
of
the
author
and
the
open
and
radical
disagreement
which
its
publication
made
manifest
in
the
ranks
of
the
founders
of
the
school
of
positive
criminology
formerly
united
in
such
close
bonds
in
the
propaganda
and
defense
of
the
new
science
criminal
anthropology
and
sociology
created
by
lombroso
it
is
true
that
the
scientific
union
between
the
founders
of
the
new
italian
school
of
criminology
formed
an
alliance
but
they
were
never
in
perfect
unison
lombroso
gave
to
the
study
of
crime
as
a
natural
and
social
phenomenon
the
initial
impulse
and
brilliantly
supported
the
correctness
of
this
conception
by
his
fruitful
anthropological
and
biological
investigations
i
contributed
the
systematic
theoretical
treatment
of
the
problem
of
human
responsibility
and
my
psychological
and
sociological
studies
enabled
me
to
classify
the
natural
causes
of
crime
and
the
anthropological
categories
of
criminals
i
showed
the
predominant
role
of
prevention
quite
a
different
thing
from
police
prevention
of
criminality
and
demonstrated
the
infinitesimal
influence
of
repression
which
is
always
violent
and
only
acts
after
the
mischief
has
been
done
garofalo
though
he
was
in
accord
with
us
on
the
subject
of
the
diagnosis
of
criminal
pathology
contributed
nevertheless
a
current
of
ideas
peculiar
to
himself
ideas
more
metaphysical
and
less
heterodox
such
for
instance
as
the
idea
that
the
anomaly
shown
by
the
criminal
is
only
a
moral
anomaly
that
religion
has
a
preventive
influence
on
criminality
that
severe
repression
is
at
all
events
the
effective
remedy
that
misery
poverty
it
not
only
not
the
sole
and
exclusive
factor
in
producing
crime
which
i
always
maintained
and
still
maintain
but
that
it
has
no
determining
influence
on
crime
and
that
popular
education
instead
of
being
a
preventive
means
is
on
the
contrary
an
incentive
etc
these
ideas
in
evident
disagreement
with
the
inductions
of
biology
and
of
criminal
psychology
and
sociology
as
i
have
elsewhere
demonstrated
nevertheless
did
not
prevent
harmony
among
the
positivists
of
the
new
school
in
fact
these
personal
and
antiquated
conceptions
of
garofalo
passed
almost
unnoticed
his
action
was
especially
notable
by
reason
of
the
greater
importance
and
development
he
gave
to
the
purely
juridical
inductions
of
the
new
school
which
he
systematized
into
a
plan
of
reforms
in
criminal
law
and
procedure
he
was
the
jurist
of
the
new
school
lombroso
was
the
anthropologist
and
i
the
sociologist
but
while
in
lombroso
and
myself
the
progressive
and
heterodox
tendency
extending
even
to
socialism
became
more
and
more
marked
it
could
already
be
foreseen
that
in
garofalo
the
orthodox
and
reactionary
tendencies
would
prevail
thus
leading
us
away
from
that
common
ground
on
which
we
have
fought
side
by
side
and
might
still
so
fight
for
i
do
not
believe
that
these
disagreements
concerning
the
social
future
must
necessarily
prevent
our
agreement
on
the
more
limited
field
of
the
present
diagnosis
of
a
phenomenon
of
social
pathology
after
the
explanation
of
this
personal
matter
we
must
now
examine
the
contents
of
this
in
order
to
see
in
this
schism
of
the
scientific
criminologists
which
side
has
followed
most
systematically
the
method
of
experimental
science
and
traced
with
the
most
rigorous
exactness
the
trajectory
of
human
evolution
we
must
see
who
is
the
more
scientific
he
who
in
carrying
the
experimental
science
beyond
the
narrow
confines
of
criminal
anthropology
and
applying
it
in
the
broad
field
of
social
science
accepts
all
the
logical
consequences
of
scientific
observations
and
gives
his
open
adherence
to
marxian
socialism
or
he
who
while
being
a
positivist
and
innovator
in
one
special
branch
of
science
remains
a
conservative
in
the
other
branches
to
which
he
refuses
to
apply
the
positive
method
and
which
he
does
not
study
with
a
critical
spirit
but
in
which
he
contents
himself
with
the
easy
and
superficial
repetition
of
trite
commonplaces
to
those
familiar
with
the
former
work
of
the
author
this
book
from
the
first
page
to
the
last
presents
a
striking
contrast
between
garofalo
the
heterodox
criminologist
ever
ready
to
criticize
with
penetration
classical
criminology
always
in
revolt
against
the
threadbare
commonplaces
of
juridical
tradition
and
garofalo
the
the
orthodox
sociologist
the
conservative
follower
of
tradition
who
finds
that
all
is
well
in
the
world
of
he
who
distinguished
himself
before
by
the
tone
of
his
publications
always
serene
and
dignified
now
permits
us
to
think
that
he
is
less
convinced
of
the
correctness
of
his
position
than
he
would
have
us
believe
and
to
cover
up
this
deficiency
of
conviction
screams
and
shouts
at
the
top
of
his
voice
for
instance
on
page
in
a
style
which
is
neither
aristocratic
nor
bourgeois
he
writes
that
bebel
had
the
to
defend
the
commune
in
a
public
session
of
the
reichstag
and
he
forgets
that
the
commune
of
paris
is
not
to
be
judged
historically
by
relying
solely
upon
the
revolting
impressions
left
upon
the
mind
by
the
artificial
and
exaggerated
accounts
of
the
bourgeois
press
of
that
time
malon
and
marx
have
shown
by
indisputable
documentary
evidence
and
on
impregnable
historical
grounds
what
the
verdict
on
the
commune
of
the
impartial
judgment
must
be
in
spite
of
the
excesses
which
as
alfred
maury
said
to
me
at
the
one
day
in
were
far
surpassed
by
the
ferocity
of
a
bloody
and
savage
repression
in
the
same
way
on
pages
he
speaks
i
can
not
see
why
of
the
contempt
of
marxian
socialists
for
sentimental
socialism
which
no
marxian
has
ever
dreamt
of
though
we
recognize
it
is
little
in
harmony
with
the
systematic
experimental
method
of
social
science
and
on
page
he
seems
to
think
he
is
carrying
on
a
scientific
discussion
when
he
writes
in
truth
when
one
sees
men
who
profess
such
doctrines
succeed
in
obtaining
a
hearing
one
is
obliged
to
recognize
that
there
are
no
limits
to
human
imbecility
ah
my
dear
baron
garofalo
how
this
language
reminds
me
of
that
of
some
of
the
classical
criminologists
do
you
remember
it
who
tried
to
combat
the
positivist
school
with
language
too
much
like
this
of
yours
which
conceals
behind
hackneyed
phrases
the
utter
lack
of
ideas
to
oppose
to
the
hated
but
victorious
heresy
but
aside
from
this
language
so
strange
from
the
pen
of
garofalo
it
is
impossible
not
to
perceive
the
strange
contrast
between
his
critical
talent
and
the
numerous
statements
in
this
book
which
are
to
say
the
least
characterized
by
a
naiveté
one
would
never
have
suspected
in
him
it
is
true
that
on
page
like
an
individualist
of
the
good
old
days
and
with
an
absolutism
which
we
may
henceforth
call
he
deplores
the
enactment
of
even
those
civil
laws
which
have
limited
the
utendi
et
freely
the
right
of
doing
what
one
will
with
one
own
tr
and
which
have
seriously
maimed
the
institution
of
private
property
since
he
says
the
lower
classes
suffer
cruelly
not
from
the
existence
of
great
fortunes
but
rather
from
the
economic
embarrassment
of
the
upper
classes
page
what
boldness
of
critical
thought
and
profundity
in
economic
science
and
in
regard
to
my
statement
that
contemporary
science
is
altogether
dominated
by
the
idea
and
the
fact
of
the
and
therefore
of
socialism
in
contrast
to
the
glorification
of
the
individual
and
therefore
of
individualism
which
obtained
in
the
eighteenth
century
garofalo
replies
to
me
that
the
story
of
robinson
crusoe
was
borrowed
from
a
very
trustworthy
history
and
adds
that
it
would
be
possible
to
cite
many
cases
of
anchorites
and
hermits
who
had
no
need
of
the
company
of
their
fellows
page
he
believes
that
he
has
thus
demonstrated
that
i
was
mistaken
when
i
declared
that
the
species
is
the
sole
eternal
reality
of
life
and
that
the
individual
himself
a
biological
aggregation
does
not
live
alone
and
by
himself
alone
but
only
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
forms
a
part
of
a
collectivity
to
which
he
owes
all
the
creative
conditions
of
his
material
moral
and
intellectual
existence
in
truth
if
garofalo
had
employed
such
arguments
to
expose
the
absurdities
of
metaphysical
penology
and
to
defend
the
heresies
of
the
positive
school
the
latter
would
certainly
not
number
him
among
its
most
eloquent
and
suggestive
founders
and
champions
and
yet
garofalo
instead
of
repeating
these
soporific
banalities
ought
to
have
been
able
to
discuss
seriously
the
fundamental
thesis
of
socialism
which
through
the
social
ownership
of
the
land
and
the
means
of
production
tends
to
assure
to
every
individual
the
conditions
of
an
existence
more
worthily
human
and
of
a
full
and
perfectly
free
development
of
his
physical
and
moral
personality
for
then
only
when
the
daily
bread
of
the
body
and
mind
is
guaranteed
will
every
man
be
able
as
goethe
said
to
become
that
which
he
is
instead
of
wasting
and
wearing
himself
out
in
the
spasmodic
and
exhausting
struggle
for
daily
bread
obtained
too
often
at
the
expense
of
personal
dignity
or
the
sacrifice
of
intellectual
aptitudes
while
human
energies
are
obviously
squandered
to
the
great
disadvantage
of
the
entire
society
and
all
this
with
the
appearance
of
personal
liberty
but
in
fact
with
the
vast
majority
of
mankind
reduced
to
dependence
upon
the
class
in
possession
of
economic
monopoly
but
garofalo
has
altogether
refrained
from
these
discussions
which
admit
of
scientific
arguments
on
either
hand
he
has
confined
himself
on
the
contrary
even
when
he
has
attempted
to
discuss
seriously
to
the
repetition
of
the
most
superficial
commonplaces
thus
for
example
page
opposing
the
socialists
who
maintain
that
the
variations
of
the
social
environment
will
inevitably
bring
about
a
change
in
individual
aptitudes
and
activities
he
writes
but
the
world
can
not
change
if
men
do
not
first
begin
by
transforming
themselves
under
the
influence
of
those
two
ideal
factors
honor
and
duty
that
is
the
same
as
saying
that
a
man
must
not
jump
into
the
water
unless
he
has
learned
beforehand
to
swim
while
remaining
on
land
nothing
on
the
contrary
is
more
in
harmony
with
the
scientific
inductions
of
biology
and
sociology
than
the
socialist
idea
according
to
which
changes
in
the
environment
cause
correlative
changes
both
physiological
and
psychical
in
individuals
the
soul
of
darwinism
is
it
not
wholly
in
the
variability
organic
and
functional
of
individuals
and
species
under
the
modifying
influence
of
the
environment
fixed
and
transmitted
by
natural
selection
and
itself
does
it
not
consist
wholly
in
the
constantly
increasing
importance
attributed
to
the
changes
in
the
environment
as
explanations
of
the
variations
of
living
beings
and
in
the
realm
of
sociology
just
as
according
to
the
repeated
and
unquestioned
demonstrations
of
spencer
in
the
passage
of
human
societies
from
the
military
type
to
the
industrial
type
as
had
already
pointed
out
a
change
a
process
of
adaptation
also
takes
place
in
that
human
nature
which
the
would
have
us
believe
is
a
fixed
and
immutable
thing
like
the
created
species
of
biology
in
the
same
way
in
the
gradual
transition
to
a
collectivist
organization
human
nature
will
necessarily
adapt
itself
to
the
modified
social
conditions
certainly
human
nature
will
not
change
in
its
fundamental
tendencies
and
as
an
illustration
man
like
the
animals
will
always
shun
suffering
and
strive
after
pleasure
since
the
former
is
a
diminution
and
the
latter
an
augmentation
of
life
but
this
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
fact
that
the
application
and
direction
of
these
biological
tendencies
can
and
must
change
with
the
changes
in
the
environment
so
that
i
have
been
able
elsewhere
to
demonstrate
that
individual
egoism
will
indeed
always
exist
but
it
will
act
in
a
profoundly
different
fashion
in
a
society
whose
conscious
goal
will
be
true
human
solidarity
from
the
way
in
which
it
acts
in
the
individualist
and
morally
anarchical
world
of
a
world
in
which
every
man
by
the
working
of
what
is
called
free
competition
is
forced
to
follow
the
impulses
of
his
egoism
that
is
to
say
to
be
in
conflict
and
not
in
harmony
with
the
wants
and
the
tendencies
of
the
other
members
of
society
but
the
repetition
of
commonplaces
reaches
its
climax
when
garofalo
surely
through
inattention
writes
these
marvelous
lines
apparently
many
young
men
of
aristocratic
families
do
not
work
it
is
nevertheless
more
correct
to
say
that
they
do
not
do
any
productive
labor
for
themselves
but
they
work
just
the
same
and
this
for
the
benefit
of
others
in
fact
these
gentlemen
leisure
are
generally
devoted
to
sport
hunting
yachting
horseback
riding
fencing
or
to
travel
or
to
in
the
arts
and
their
activity
unproductive
for
themselves
provides
an
immense
number
of
persons
with
profitable
occupations
page
one
day
when
i
was
studying
the
prisoners
in
a
jail
one
of
them
said
to
me
such
an
outcry
is
made
against
the
criminals
because
they
do
not
work
but
if
we
did
not
exist
an
immense
number
of
persons
jailers
policemen
judges
and
lawyers
would
be
without
a
profitable
occupation
after
having
noted
these
of
unscientific
carelessness
and
before
entering
upon
the
examination
of
the
few
scientific
arguments
developed
by
garofalo
it
will
be
well
to
aid
us
in
forming
a
general
judgment
on
his
book
to
show
how
far
he
has
forgotten
the
most
elementary
rules
of
the
scientific
method
and
it
will
be
useful
also
to
add
a
few
examples
of
mistakes
in
regard
to
facts
bearing
either
on
science
in
general
or
on
the
doctrines
combated
by
him
on
page
speaking
of
the
scientific
work
of
marx
with
a
disdain
which
can
not
be
taken
seriously
since
it
is
too
much
like
that
of
the
theologians
for
darwin
or
that
of
the
jurists
for
lombroso
he
reasons
in
this
curious
fashion
starting
from
the
hypothesis
that
all
private
property
is
unjust
it
is
not
logic
that
is
wanting
in
the
doctrine
of
marx
but
one
on
the
contrary
every
individual
has
a
right
to
possess
some
thing
of
his
the
direct
and
inevitable
consequence
is
the
rightfulness
of
the
profits
of
capital
and
therefore
the
augmentation
of
the
latter
certainly
if
one
admits
the
right
of
individual
property
in
the
land
and
the
means
of
production
it
is
needless
and
useless
to
discuss
the
question
but
the
troublesome
fact
is
that
all
the
scientific
work
of
marx
and
the
socialists
has
been
done
precisely
in
order
to
furnish
absolute
scientific
proof
of
the
true
genesis
of
capitalist
property
the
unpaid
of
the
laborer
and
to
put
an
end
to
the
old
fables
about
the
first
occupant
and
accumulated
savings
which
are
only
exceptions
ever
becoming
rarer
moreover
the
negation
of
private
property
is
not
the
hypothesis
but
the
logical
and
inevitable
consequence
of
the
premises
of
and
of
demonstrations
made
not
only
by
marx
but
by
a
numerous
group
of
sociologists
who
abandoning
the
reticence
and
mental
reservations
of
orthodox
conventionalism
have
by
that
step
become
socialists
but
contemporary
socialism
for
the
very
reason
that
it
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
scientific
and
exact
thought
no
longer
harbors
the
illusions
of
those
who
fancy
that
with
a
dictator
of
wonderful
intelligence
and
remarkable
eloquence
charged
with
the
duty
of
organizing
collectivism
by
means
of
decrees
and
regulations
we
could
reach
the
commonwealth
at
a
bound
eliminating
the
intermediate
phases
moreover
is
not
the
absolute
and
unbridled
individualism
of
yesterday
already
transformed
into
a
limited
individualism
and
into
a
partial
collectivism
by
legal
limitations
of
the
and
by
the
continuous
transformation
into
social
functions
or
public
properties
of
the
services
lighting
transportation
etc
or
properties
roads
bridges
canals
etc
which
were
formerly
private
services
and
properties
these
intermediate
phases
can
not
be
suppressed
by
decrees
but
they
develop
and
finish
their
course
naturally
day
by
day
under
the
pressure
of
the
economic
and
social
conditions
but
by
a
natural
and
therefore
inexorable
progress
they
are
constantly
approaching
more
closely
that
ultimate
phase
of
absolute
collectivism
in
the
means
of
production
which
the
socialists
have
not
invented
but
the
tendency
toward
which
they
have
shown
and
whose
ultimate
attainment
they
scientifically
predict
the
rate
of
progress
toward
this
goal
they
can
accelerate
by
giving
to
the
proletarians
organized
into
a
a
clearer
consciousness
of
their
historic
mission
all
through
this
book
are
scattered
not
only
defects
of
method
but
also
actual
errors
in
matters
of
fact
the
book
is
also
marred
by
an
immanent
contradiction
that
runs
all
through
it
in
connection
with
the
absolutely
uncompromising
attitude
against
socialism
which
the
author
aims
to
maintain
but
which
he
is
unable
to
keep
up
in
the
face
of
the
irresistible
tendency
of
the
facts
as
we
shall
see
in
the
conclusion
of
this
analysis
in
chapter
iv
garofalo
contends
that
civilization
would
be
menaced
with
destruction
by
the
elevation
to
power
of
the
popular
classes
garofalo
who
is
of
an
old
aristocratic
family
declares
that
the
third
estate
which
should
have
substituted
youthful
energies
for
the
feebleness
and
corruption
of
an
effete
and
degenerate
aristocracy
has
shown
magnified
the
defects
and
corruption
of
the
latter
this
is
certainly
not
a
correct
historical
judgment
for
it
is
certain
that
the
third
estate
which
with
the
french
revolution
gained
political
ascendancy
a
political
ascendancy
made
inevitable
by
its
previously
won
economic
ascendancy
gave
in
the
course
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
new
and
powerful
impulse
to
civilization
and
if
after
a
century
of
undisputed
domination
the
bourgeoisie
shows
multiplied
a
the
defects
and
the
corruption
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
eighteenth
century
this
signifies
simply
that
the
third
estate
has
reached
the
final
phase
of
its
parabola
so
that
the
advent
of
a
more
developed
social
phase
is
becoming
an
imminent
historical
necessity
another
error
in
criminal
psychology
natural
enough
for
idealists
and
metaphysicians
but
which
may
well
surprise
us
in
an
exact
scientist
is
the
influence
upon
human
conduct
which
garofalo
attributes
to
the
religious
sentiment
moral
instruction
has
no
meaning
or
at
least
no
efficacy
without
a
religious
basis
and
from
this
erroneous
psychological
premise
he
draws
the
conclusion
that
it
is
necessary
to
return
to
religious
instruction
in
the
schools
selecting
the
masters
from
among
men
of
mature
age
fathers
of
families
or
of
in
combating
this
conclusion
truly
surprising
in
a
scientist
it
is
useless
to
recall
the
teachings
of
the
experience
of
former
times
in
regard
to
the
pretended
moralizing
influence
of
the
priest
upon
the
school
and
it
is
also
unnecessary
to
recall
the
statistics
of
criminal
assaults
committed
by
priests
condemned
to
celibacy
it
is
equally
superfluous
to
add
that
at
all
events
in
again
turning
the
priest
into
a
schoolmaster
it
would
be
necessary
to
recommend
to
him
never
to
recall
the
invectives
of
jesus
against
the
rich
the
metaphor
of
the
camel
passing
through
the
eye
of
a
needle
or
the
still
more
violent
invectives
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
against
private
property
for
long
before
proudhon
saint
jerome
had
said
that
wealth
is
always
the
product
of
theft
if
it
was
not
committed
by
the
present
holder
it
was
by
his
ancestors
and
saint
ambrose
added
that
nature
has
established
community
of
goods
from
usurpation
alone
is
private
property
born
if
it
is
true
that
later
on
the
church
in
proportion
as
it
departed
from
the
doctrines
of
the
master
preached
in
favor
of
the
rich
leaving
to
the
poor
the
hope
of
paradise
and
if
it
is
true
as
garofalo
says
that
the
christian
philosophers
exhorted
the
poor
to
sanctify
the
tribulations
of
poverty
by
resignation
it
is
also
true
that
for
example
bossuet
in
one
of
his
famous
sermons
recognized
that
the
complaints
of
the
poor
are
justified
and
he
asked
why
are
conditions
so
unequal
we
are
all
formed
of
the
same
dust
and
nothing
can
justify
it
so
that
recently
in
the
name
of
an
hermaphrodite
liberalism
recalled
that
the
right
of
private
property
is
rather
tolerated
by
the
church
as
an
existing
fact
than
presented
as
a
necessary
foundation
of
civil
society
it
is
even
condemned
in
its
inspiring
principle
by
the
fathers
of
the
church
but
apart
from
all
this
it
is
sufficient
for
me
to
establish
that
the
psychological
premise
from
which
garofalo
starts
is
erroneous
in
itself
studying
elsewhere
the
influence
of
the
religious
sentiment
on
criminality
i
have
shown
by
positive
documentary
evidence
that
religious
beliefs
efficacious
for
individuals
already
endowed
with
a
normal
social
sense
since
they
add
to
the
sanction
of
the
moral
conscience
which
however
would
suffice
by
itself
the
sanctions
of
the
life
beyond
the
tomb
religion
is
the
guarantor
of
justice
are
nevertheless
wholly
ineffective
when
the
social
sense
on
account
of
some
anomaly
is
atrophied
or
so
that
religious
belief
considered
as
a
regulator
of
social
conduct
is
at
once
superfluous
for
honorable
people
and
altogether
ineffective
for
those
who
are
not
honorable
if
indeed
it
is
not
capable
of
increasing
the
propensity
to
evil
by
developing
religious
fanaticism
or
giving
rise
to
the
hope
of
pardon
in
the
confessional
or
of
absolution
articulo
etc
it
is
possible
to
understand
at
least
as
an
expedient
as
utilitarian
as
it
is
highly
hypocritical
the
argument
of
those
who
atheists
so
far
as
they
themselves
are
concerned
still
wish
to
preserve
religious
beliefs
for
the
people
because
they
exercise
a
depressing
influence
and
prevent
all
energetic
agitation
for
human
rights
and
enjoyments
the
conception
of
god
as
a
policeman
is
only
one
among
many
illusions
besides
these
errors
of
fact
in
the
biological
and
psychological
sciences
garofalo
also
misstates
the
socialist
doctrines
following
the
example
of
the
opponents
of
the
new
school
of
criminology
who
found
it
easier
to
refute
the
doctrines
they
attributed
to
us
than
to
shake
the
doctrines
we
defended
on
page
garofalo
begins
by
stating
the
true
tendency
of
the
party
known
as
the
workingmen
party
is
to
gain
power
in
the
interest
of
but
in
order
to
expropriate
the
dominant
class
and
step
into
their
they
do
not
disguise
this
purpose
in
their
programmes
this
statement
is
found
again
on
page
etc
now
it
suffices
to
have
read
the
programme
of
the
socialist
party
from
the
manifesto
of
marx
and
engels
down
to
the
propagandist
publications
to
know
on
the
contrary
that
contemporary
socialism
wishes
and
declares
its
wish
to
accomplish
the
general
suppression
of
all
social
divisions
into
classes
by
suppressing
the
division
of
the
social
patrimony
of
production
and
therefore
proclaims
itself
resolved
to
achieve
the
prosperity
of
all
and
not
only
as
some
victims
of
myopia
continue
to
believe
that
of
a
fourth
estate
which
would
simply
have
to
follow
the
example
of
the
decaying
third
estate
starting
from
this
fundamental
datum
of
socialism
that
unless
he
be
a
child
sick
or
an
invalid
work
in
order
to
at
one
sort
or
another
of
useful
labor
it
follows
as
an
inevitable
consequence
that
in
a
society
organized
on
this
principle
all
class
antagonism
will
become
impossible
for
this
antagonism
exists
only
when
society
contains
a
great
majority
who
work
in
order
to
live
in
discomfort
and
a
small
minority
who
live
well
without
working
this
initial
error
naturally
dominates
the
entire
book
thus
for
instance
the
third
chapter
is
devoted
to
proving
that
the
social
revolution
planned
for
by
the
new
socialists
will
be
the
destruction
of
all
in
society
because
it
is
without
an
to
serve
it
as
a
luminous
standard
let
us
disregard
my
dear
baron
the
famous
moral
order
of
that
society
which
enriches
and
honors
the
wholesale
thieves
of
the
great
and
little
panamas
the
banks
and
railways
and
condemns
to
imprisonment
children
and
women
who
steal
dry
wood
or
grass
in
the
fields
which
formerly
belonged
to
the
commune
but
to
say
that
socialism
is
without
an
when
even
its
opponents
concede
to
it
this
immense
superiority
in
potential
strength
over
the
sordid
skepticism
of
the
present
world
its
ardent
faith
in
a
higher
social
justice
for
all
a
faith
that
makes
strikingly
clear
its
resemblance
to
the
regenerating
christianity
of
primitive
times
very
different
from
that
fatty
degeneration
of
christianity
called
catholicism
to
say
this
is
truly
for
a
scientist
to
blindly
rebel
against
the
most
obvious
facts
of
daily
life
garofalo
even
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
want
of
the
necessaries
of
life
is
a
very
exceptional
fact
and
that
therefore
the
condition
of
the
proletariat
is
a
like
that
of
all
the
other
classes
and
the
lack
of
capital
which
is
its
characteristic
is
a
permanent
economic
condition
is
not
at
all
for
those
who
are
used
to
it
then
while
passing
over
this
comfortable
and
egoistic
quietism
which
finds
nothing
abnormal
in
the
misery
of
others
we
perceive
how
deficient
garofalo
is
in
the
most
elementary
accuracy
in
the
ascertainment
of
facts
when
we
recall
the
suffering
and
multitude
of
the
which
is
sometimes
a
local
and
transitory
phenomenon
but
which
in
its
acute
or
chronic
forms
is
always
the
necessary
and
incontestable
effect
of
capitalist
accumulation
and
the
introduction
and
improvement
of
machinery
which
are
in
their
turn
the
source
of
modern
socialism
scientific
socialism
so
different
from
the
sentimental
socialism
of
former
times
but
the
fundamental
fallacy
from
which
so
many
thinkers
garofalo
among
them
can
not
free
themselves
and
to
which
i
myself
yielded
before
i
had
penetrated
thanks
to
the
marxian
theory
of
historic
materialism
or
more
exactly
of
economic
determinism
into
the
true
spirit
of
socialist
sociology
is
the
tendency
to
judge
the
inductions
of
socialism
by
the
biological
psychological
and
sociological
data
of
the
present
society
without
thinking
of
the
necessary
changes
that
will
be
effected
by
a
different
economic
environment
with
its
inevitable
concomitants
or
consequences
different
moral
and
political
environments
in
garofalo
book
we
find
once
more
this
which
refuses
to
believe
in
the
future
in
the
name
of
the
present
which
is
declared
immutable
it
is
exactly
as
if
in
the
earliest
geological
epochs
it
had
been
concluded
from
the
flora
and
fauna
then
existing
that
it
was
impossible
for
a
fauna
and
flora
ever
to
exist
differing
from
them
as
widely
as
do
the
cryptogams
from
the
conifers
or
the
mammalia
from
the
mollusca
this
confirms
once
more
the
observation
that
i
made
before
that
to
deny
the
truth
of
scientific
socialism
is
implicitly
to
deny
that
law
of
universal
and
eternal
evolution
which
is
the
dominant
factor
in
all
modern
scientific
thought
on
page
garofalo
predicts
that
with
the
triumph
of
socialism
we
shall
see
upon
earth
the
reign
of
irrational
and
brutal
physical
force
and
that
we
shall
witness
happens
every
in
the
lowest
strata
of
the
population
the
triumph
of
the
most
violent
men
and
he
repeats
this
on
pages
but
he
forgets
that
given
the
socialist
premise
of
a
better
organized
social
environment
this
brutality
which
is
the
product
of
the
present
misery
and
lack
of
education
must
necessarily
gradually
diminish
and
at
last
disappear
now
the
possibility
of
this
improvement
of
the
social
environment
which
socialism
asserts
is
a
thesis
that
can
be
discussed
but
when
a
writer
in
order
to
deny
this
possibility
opposes
to
the
future
the
effects
of
a
present
whose
elimination
is
the
precise
question
at
issue
he
falls
into
that
insidious
fallacy
which
it
is
only
necessary
to
point
out
to
remove
all
foundation
from
his
arguments
and
it
is
as
always
by
grace
of
this
same
fallacy
that
he
is
able
to
declare
on
page
that
under
the
socialist
regime
the
fine
arts
will
be
unable
to
exist
it
is
easy
to
say
they
will
henceforth
be
exercised
and
cultivated
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
of
what
public
of
the
great
mass
of
the
people
of
artistic
as
if
when
poverty
is
once
eliminated
and
labor
has
become
less
exhausting
for
the
popular
classes
the
comfort
and
economic
security
which
would
result
from
this
would
not
be
sure
to
develop
in
them
also
the
taste
for
æsthetic
pleasure
which
they
feel
and
satisfy
now
so
far
as
that
is
possible
for
them
in
the
various
forms
of
popular
art
or
as
may
be
seen
it
paris
and
vienna
by
the
and
at
brussells
by
the
free
musical
matinées
instituted
by
the
socialists
and
frequented
by
a
constantly
growing
number
of
workingmen
it
is
just
the
same
with
regard
to
scientific
instruction
as
witness
university
extension
in
england
and
belgium
and
all
this
notwithstanding
the
present
total
lack
of
artistic
education
but
thanks
to
the
exigence
among
the
workers
of
these
countries
of
an
economic
condition
lees
wretched
than
that
of
the
agricultural
or
even
the
industrial
proletariat
in
countries
such
as
italy
and
from
another
point
of
view
what
are
the
museums
if
not
a
form
of
collective
ownership
and
use
of
the
products
of
art
it
is
again
as
always
the
same
fallacy
which
at
page
makes
garofalo
write
the
history
of
europe
from
the
fifth
to
the
thirteenth
centuries
shows
us
what
would
happen
to
the
world
if
the
lower
classes
should
come
into
power
how
to
explain
the
medieval
barbarism
and
anarchy
save
by
the
grossness
and
ignorance
of
the
conquerors
same
would
inevitably
await
the
modern
civilization
if
the
controlling
power
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
proletarians
who
assuredly
intellectually
not
superior
to
the
ancient
and
morally
are
far
inferior
to
them
let
us
disregard
this
unjustified
and
unjustifiable
insult
and
this
completely
erroneous
historical
comparison
it
is
enough
to
point
out
that
it
is
here
supposed
that
by
a
stroke
of
a
magic
wand
the
lower
classes
will
be
able
in
a
single
day
to
gain
possession
of
power
without
having
been
prepared
for
this
by
a
preliminary
moral
revolution
a
revolution
accomplished
in
them
by
the
acquired
consciousness
of
their
rights
and
of
their
organic
solidarity
it
will
be
impossible
to
compare
the
proletarians
in
whom
this
moral
revolution
shall
have
taken
place
with
the
barbarians
of
the
middle
ages
in
my
book
et
published
in
and
which
my
adversaries
including
garofalo
try
to
oppose
to
the
opinions
which
i
have
upheld
in
my
more
recent
book
et
science
the
present
work
i
have
developed
two
theses
i
that
the
social
organization
could
not
be
changed
as
was
then
maintained
in
italy
by
the
sentimental
socialists
since
the
law
of
evolution
dominates
with
sovereign
power
the
human
world
as
well
as
the
inorganic
and
organic
world
ii
that
by
analogy
crime
could
not
disappear
from
among
mankind
as
the
italian
socialists
of
those
days
vaguely
hinted
now
in
the
first
place
it
would
not
have
been
at
all
inconsistent
if
after
having
partially
accepted
socialism
which
i
had
already
done
in
the
progressive
evolution
of
my
thought
after
having
studied
the
systematic
scientific
form
given
to
socialism
by
marx
and
his
had
led
me
to
recognize
apart
from
all
personal
advantage
the
complete
truth
of
socialism
but
especially
precisely
because
scientific
socialism
since
the
work
of
marx
engels
malon
de
paepe
dramard
lanessan
guesde
schaeffle
george
bebel
loria
colajanni
turati
de
greef
lafargue
jaurès
renard
denis
plechanow
vandervelde
letourneau
jacoby
labriola
kautsky
etc
is
different
from
the
sentimental
socialism
which
i
had
alone
in
mind
in
it
is
for
that
very
reason
that
i
still
maintain
these
two
same
principal
theses
and
i
find
myself
in
so
doing
in
perfect
harmony
with
international
scientific
socialism
and
as
to
the
absolute
disappearance
of
all
criminality
i
still
maintain
my
thesis
of
and
in
the
present
book
i
have
written
that
even
under
the
socialist
regime
there
will
be
though
infinitely
fewer
some
who
will
be
conquered
in
the
struggle
for
existence
and
that
though
the
chronic
and
epidemic
forms
of
nervous
disease
crime
insanity
and
suicide
are
destined
to
disappear
the
acute
and
sporadic
forms
will
not
completely
disappear
at
this
statement
garofalo
manifests
a
surprise
which
as
i
can
not
suppose
it
simulated
i
declare
truly
inexplicable
in
a
sociologist
and
a
criminologist
for
this
reminds
me
too
strongly
of
the
ignorant
surprise
shown
by
a
review
of
classical
jurisprudence
in
regard
to
a
new
scientific
fact
recorded
by
the
de
of
lombroso
the
case
being
the
disappearance
of
every
criminal
tendency
in
a
woman
after
the
surgical
removal
of
her
ovaries
but
that
the
trepanning
of
the
skull
in
a
case
of
traumatic
epilepsy
or
that
ovariotomy
can
cure
the
central
nervous
system
and
therefore
restore
the
character
and
even
the
morality
of
the
individual
these
are
facts
that
can
be
unknown
only
to
a
metaphysical
idealist
an
opponent
of
the
positivist
school
of
criminology
and
yet
this
is
how
garofalo
comments
on
my
induction
this
commentary
is
reproduced
again
on
pages
and
it
is
truly
extraordinary
that
ferri
notwithstanding
that
criminal
anthropology
of
which
he
has
so
long
been
and
still
is
one
of
the
most
ardent
partisans
should
have
allowed
himself
to
be
so
blinded
by
the
mirage
of
socialism
a
statement
such
as
that
which
i
have
quoted
at
first
leaves
the
reader
stunned
since
he
sees
absolutely
between
nervous
diseases
and
collective
ownership
it
would
be
just
as
sensible
to
say
that
by
the
study
of
algebra
one
can
make
sure
of
one
child
being
a
male
how
exactly
like
the
remarks
of
the
review
of
jurisprudence
concerning
the
case
of
the
removal
of
the
ovaries
now
let
us
see
whether
it
is
possible
by
a
supreme
effort
of
our
feeble
intellect
to
point
out
a
connection
between
nervous
diseases
and
collective
ownership
that
poverty
inadequate
physical
and
mental
nutrition
in
the
life
of
the
individual
and
through
hereditary
transmission
is
if
not
the
only
and
exclusive
cause
certainly
the
principal
cause
of
human
degeneration
is
henceforth
an
indisputable
and
undisputed
fact
that
the
poverty
and
misery
of
the
working
class
and
notably
of
the
unhappy
triad
of
the
unemployed
the
displaced
by
machinery
trusts
etc
and
those
who
have
been
expropriated
by
taxation
is
destined
to
disappear
with
the
socialization
of
the
land
and
the
means
of
production
this
is
the
proposition
that
socialism
maintains
and
demonstrates
it
is
therefore
natural
that
under
the
socialist
régime
with
the
disappearance
of
poverty
there
should
be
eliminated
the
principal
source
of
popular
degeneracy
in
the
epidemic
and
chronic
forms
of
diseases
crimes
insanity
and
suicide
this
can
moreover
be
seen
at
present
on
a
small
scale
but
clearly
enough
to
positively
confirm
the
general
induction
since
diseases
nervous
crimes
insanity
and
suicide
increase
during
famines
and
crises
while
they
diminish
in
years
when
the
economic
conditions
are
less
wretched
there
is
still
more
to
be
said
even
among
the
aristocracy
and
bourgeoisie
no
one
can
fail
to
see
that
the
feverish
competition
and
cannibalistic
strife
of
our
present
system
beget
nervous
disorders
crime
and
suicide
which
would
be
rendered
quite
unnecessary
by
the
establishment
of
a
socialist
régime
which
would
banish
worry
and
uneasiness
for
the
morrow
from
the
human
race
there
then
you
see
established
the
relation
between
collective
ownership
and
nervous
diseases
or
degeneration
in
general
not
only
among
the
popular
and
more
numerous
classes
but
also
in
the
bourgeois
and
aristocratic
classes
it
is
indeed
astonishing
that
the
prejudice
of
garofalo
should
have
been
strong
enough
to
cause
him
to
forget
that
truth
which
is
nevertheless
a
legitimate
induction
of
criminal
biology
and
sociology
the
truth
that
besides
the
congenital
criminal
there
are
other
types
of
criminals
who
are
more
numerous
and
more
directly
produced
by
the
vitiated
social
environment
and
finally
if
the
congenital
criminal
is
not
himself
the
direct
product
of
the
environment
he
is
indirectly
its
product
through
the
degeneration
begun
in
his
ancestors
by
some
acute
disease
in
some
cases
but
by
debilitating
poverty
in
the
majority
of
cases
and
afterward
hereditarily
transmitted
and
aggravated
in
accordance
with
the
inexorable
laws
discovered
by
modern
science
garofalo
book
which
was
announced
as
an
assault
of
science
upon
socialism
has
been
even
from
this
point
of
view
a
complete
disappointment
as
even
the
italian
have
confessed
in
several
of
the
most
orthodox
reviews
it
now
remains
for
me
to
reply
briefly
to
his
observations
and
they
are
few
and
far
between
on
the
relations
which
exist
between
contemporary
socialism
and
the
general
trend
and
tendency
of
thought
in
the
exact
sciences
disregarding
the
arguments
which
i
had
developed
on
this
subject
by
pointing
out
that
there
is
an
essential
connection
between
economic
and
social
transmutation
marx
and
the
theories
of
biological
transmutation
darwin
and
of
universal
transmutation
spencer
garofalo
has
thought
it
prudent
to
take
up
for
consideration
only
the
struggle
for
existence
and
the
relations
between
evolution
and
revolution
as
to
the
first
five
pages
are
enough
to
enable
him
to
declare
without
supporting
his
declaration
by
any
positive
argument
which
is
not
merely
a
different
verbal
expression
of
the
same
idea
that
the
darwinian
law
of
the
struggle
for
existence
has
not
undergone
and
can
not
undergo
any
transformation
except
that
which
will
change
the
violent
struggle
into
competition
the
struggle
of
skill
and
intelligence
and
that
this
law
is
irreconcilable
with
socialism
for
it
necessarily
requires
the
sacrifice
of
the
conquered
while
socialism
would
guarantee
to
all
men
their
material
existence
so
they
would
have
no
cause
for
anxiety
but
my
friend
the
baron
garofalo
quietly
and
completely
ignores
the
fundamental
argument
that
the
socialists
oppose
to
the
individualist
interpretation
that
has
hitherto
been
given
of
the
struggle
for
life
and
which
still
affects
the
minds
of
some
socialists
so
far
as
to
make
them
think
that
the
law
of
the
struggle
for
life
is
not
true
and
that
darwinism
is
irreconcilable
with
socialism
the
socialists
in
fact
think
that
the
laws
of
life
are
the
following
and
that
they
are
concurrent
and
inseparable
struggle
for
and
in
the
struggle
against
natural
if
the
first
law
is
in
spirit
individualist
the
second
is
essentially
socialistic
now
not
to
repeat
what
i
have
written
elsewhere
it
is
sufficient
here
for
me
to
establish
this
positive
fact
that
all
human
evolution
is
effected
through
the
constantly
increasing
predominance
of
the
law
of
solidarity
over
the
law
of
the
struggle
for
existence
the
forms
of
the
struggle
are
transformed
and
grow
milder
as
i
showed
as
long
ago
as
and
garofalo
accepts
this
way
of
looking
at
the
matter
when
he
recognizes
that
the
muscular
struggle
is
ever
tending
to
become
an
intellectual
struggle
but
he
has
in
view
only
the
formal
evolution
he
wholly
disregards
the
progressive
decrease
in
the
importance
of
the
struggling
function
under
the
action
of
the
other
parallel
law
of
solidarity
in
the
struggle
here
comes
in
that
constant
principle
in
sociology
that
the
social
forms
and
forces
always
but
that
their
relative
importance
changes
from
epoch
to
epoch
and
from
place
to
place
just
as
in
the
individual
egoism
and
altruism
and
will
always
for
egoism
is
the
basis
of
personal
existence
but
with
a
continuous
and
progressive
restriction
and
transformation
of
egoism
corresponding
to
the
expansion
of
altruism
in
passing
from
the
fierce
egoism
of
savage
humanity
to
the
less
brutal
egoism
of
the
present
epoch
and
finally
to
the
more
fraternal
egoism
of
the
coming
society
in
the
same
way
in
the
social
organism
for
example
the
military
type
and
the
industrial
type
always
but
with
a
progressively
increasing
predominance
of
the
latter
over
the
former
the
same
truth
applies
to
the
different
forms
of
the
family
and
also
to
many
other
institutions
of
which
spencerian
sociology
had
given
only
the
evolution
and
of
which
the
marxian
theory
of
economic
determinism
has
given
the
evolution
by
explaining
that
the
religious
and
juridical
customs
and
institutions
the
social
types
the
forms
of
the
family
are
only
the
reflex
of
the
economic
structure
which
differs
in
varying
localities
on
islands
or
continents
according
to
the
abundance
or
scarcity
of
food
and
also
varies
from
epoch
to
epoch
and
to
complete
the
marxian
theory
this
economic
structure
is
in
the
case
of
each
social
group
the
resultant
of
its
race
energies
developing
themselves
in
such
or
such
a
physical
environment
at
i
have
said
elsewhere
the
same
rule
holds
in
the
case
of
the
two
laws
of
the
for
and
of
in
the
the
first
of
which
predominates
where
the
economic
conditions
are
more
difficult
while
the
second
predominates
with
the
growth
of
the
economic
security
of
the
majority
but
while
this
security
will
become
complete
under
the
régime
of
socialism
which
will
assure
to
every
man
who
works
the
material
means
of
life
this
will
not
exclude
the
intellectual
forms
of
the
struggle
for
existence
which
tchisch
recently
said
should
be
interpreted
not
only
in
the
sense
of
a
for
but
also
in
the
sense
of
a
for
the
enrichment
of
in
fact
when
once
the
material
life
of
every
one
is
assured
together
with
the
duty
of
labor
for
the
members
of
society
man
will
continue
always
to
struggle
the
enrichment
of
that
is
to
say
for
the
fuller
development
of
his
physical
and
moral
individuality
and
it
is
only
under
the
régime
of
socialism
that
the
predominance
of
the
law
of
solidarity
being
decisive
the
struggle
for
existence
will
change
its
form
and
substance
while
persisting
as
an
eternal
striving
toward
a
better
life
in
the
development
of
the
individual
and
the
collectivity
but
garofalo
devotes
more
attention
to
the
practical
relations
between
socialism
and
the
law
of
evolution
and
in
once
more
making
use
of
the
objection
already
so
often
raised
against
marxism
and
its
tactics
he
formulates
his
indictment
thus
the
new
socialists
who
on
the
one
hand
pretend
to
speak
in
the
name
of
sociological
science
and
of
the
natural
laws
of
evolution
declare
themselves
politically
on
the
other
hand
as
revolutionists
now
evidently
science
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
political
action
although
they
take
pains
to
say
that
by
revolution
they
do
not
mean
either
a
riot
or
a
revolt
an
explanation
also
contained
in
the
dictionary
this
fact
always
remains
that
they
are
unwilling
to
await
the
organization
of
society
under
the
new
economic
arrangement
foreseen
by
them
in
a
more
or
less
remote
future
for
if
they
should
thus
quietly
await
its
coming
who
among
them
would
survive
to
prove
to
the
incredulous
the
truth
of
their
predictions
it
is
a
question
then
of
an
evolution
that
is
to
say
in
other
words
of
the
of
to
transform
society
in
accordance
with
their
wishes
p
the
socialists
of
the
marxian
school
do
not
expect
the
transformation
to
be
effected
by
a
slow
evolution
but
by
a
of
the
and
they
even
fix
the
epoch
of
its
occurence
p
henceforth
the
socialists
must
make
a
decision
and
take
one
horn
of
the
dilemma
or
the
other
either
they
must
be
who
wait
patiently
until
the
time
shall
be
ripe
or
on
the
contrary
they
must
be
and
if
they
take
this
horn
it
is
nonsense
to
talk
of
evolution
accumulation
spontaneous
concentration
etc
accomplish
then
this
revolution
if
you
have
the
power
p
i
do
not
wish
to
dwell
on
this
curious
instigation
to
civil
war
by
such
an
orthodox
conservative
as
the
baron
garofalo
although
he
might
be
suspected
of
the
not
specially
christian
wish
to
see
this
revolution
of
the
people
break
out
at
once
while
the
people
are
still
disorganized
and
weak
and
while
it
would
be
easier
for
the
dominant
class
to
bleed
them
copiously
let
us
try
rather
to
deliver
garofalo
from
another
trouble
for
on
page
he
exclaims
pathetically
i
declare
on
my
honor
i
do
not
understand
how
a
sincere
socialist
can
be
a
revolutionist
i
would
be
sincerely
grateful
to
anyone
who
would
explain
this
to
me
for
to
me
this
is
an
enigma
so
great
is
the
contradiction
between
the
theory
and
the
methods
of
the
socialists
well
then
console
yourself
my
excellent
friend
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
relationship
between
collective
ownership
and
human
degeneration
which
seemed
so
enigmatical
to
this
same
baron
garofalo
and
although
he
has
not
offered
his
gratitude
for
the
solution
of
this
enigma
to
the
socialist
oedipus
who
explained
it
to
him
here
also
in
the
case
of
this
other
enigma
the
explanation
is
very
simple
on
the
subject
of
the
social
question
the
attitudes
assumed
in
the
domain
of
science
or
on
the
field
of
politics
are
the
following
that
of
the
such
as
garofalo
these
judging
the
world
not
by
the
conditions
objectively
established
but
by
their
own
subjective
impressions
consider
that
they
are
well
enough
off
under
the
present
régime
and
contend
that
everything
is
for
the
best
in
this
best
of
all
possible
worlds
and
oppose
in
all
cases
with
a
very
logical
egoism
every
change
which
is
not
merely
a
superficial
change
that
of
the
who
like
all
the
eclectics
whose
number
is
infinite
give
as
the
italian
proverb
says
one
blow
to
the
cask
and
another
to
the
hoop
and
do
not
deny
o
no
the
inconveniences
and
even
the
absurdities
of
the
present
but
not
to
compromise
themselves
too
far
hasten
to
say
that
they
must
confine
themselves
to
minor
ameliorations
to
superficial
reforms
that
is
to
say
to
treating
the
symptoms
instead
of
the
disease
a
therapeutic
method
as
easy
and
as
barren
of
abiding
results
in
dealing
with
the
social
organism
as
with
the
individual
organism
that
finally
of
the
who
rightly
call
themselves
thus
because
they
think
and
say
that
the
effective
remedy
is
not
to
be
found
in
superficial
reforms
but
in
a
radical
reorganization
of
society
beginning
at
the
very
foundation
private
property
and
which
will
be
so
profound
that
it
will
truly
constitute
a
social
revolution
it
is
in
this
sense
that
galileo
accomplished
a
scientific
revolution
for
he
did
not
confine
himself
to
reforms
of
the
astronomical
system
received
in
his
time
but
he
radically
changed
its
fundamental
lines
and
it
is
in
this
same
sense
that
jacquart
effected
an
industrial
revolution
since
he
did
not
confine
himself
to
reforming
the
as
it
had
existed
for
centuries
but
radically
changed
its
structure
and
productive
power
therefore
when
socialists
speak
of
socialism
as
they
mean
by
this
to
describe
the
programme
to
be
realized
and
the
final
goal
to
be
attained
and
not
as
garofalo
in
spite
of
the
dictionary
continues
to
believe
the
method
or
the
tactics
to
be
employed
in
achieving
this
goal
the
social
revolution
and
right
here
appears
the
profound
difference
between
the
method
of
sentimental
socialism
and
that
of
scientific
socialism
henceforth
the
only
socialism
in
the
civilized
world
which
has
received
through
the
work
of
marx
engels
and
their
successors
that
systematic
form
which
is
the
distinctive
mark
of
all
the
sciences
and
that
is
why
and
how
i
have
been
able
to
demonstrate
that
contemporary
socialism
is
in
full
harmony
with
the
scientific
doctrine
of
evolution
socialism
is
in
fact
evolutionary
but
not
in
the
sense
that
garofalo
prefers
of
waiting
patiently
until
the
times
shall
be
ripe
and
until
society
shall
organize
under
the
new
economic
arrangement
as
if
science
necessarily
must
consist
in
oriental
contemplation
and
academic
platonism
as
it
has
done
for
too
long
instead
of
investigating
the
conditions
of
actual
life
and
applying
its
inductions
to
them
certainly
science
for
the
sake
of
science
is
a
formula
very
satisfactory
to
the
avowed
conservatives
and
that
is
only
logical
and
also
to
the
eclectics
but
modern
positivism
prefers
the
formula
of
science
for
life
sake
and
therefore
thinks
that
the
ripeness
of
the
times
and
the
new
economic
arrangement
will
certainly
not
be
realized
by
spontaneous
generation
and
that
therefore
it
is
necessary
to
act
in
harmony
with
the
inductions
of
science
in
order
to
bring
this
realization
to
pass
to
act
but
there
is
the
question
of
methods
and
tactics
which
differentiates
utopian
socialism
from
scientific
socialism
the
former
fancied
it
possible
to
alter
the
economic
organization
of
society
from
top
to
bottom
by
the
improvised
miracle
of
a
popular
insurrection
the
latter
on
the
contrary
declares
that
the
law
of
evolution
is
supreme
and
that
therefore
the
social
revolution
can
be
nothing
but
the
final
phase
of
a
preliminary
evolution
which
will
consist
through
scientific
study
and
propaganda
work
in
the
realization
of
the
exhortation
of
marx
of
all
countries
unite
there
then
is
the
explanation
of
the
enigma
presented
by
the
fact
that
socialism
though
revolutionary
in
its
programme
follows
the
laws
of
evolution
in
its
method
of
realization
and
that
is
the
secret
of
its
vitality
and
power
and
that
is
also
what
makes
it
so
essentially
different
from
that
mystical
and
violent
anarchism
which
class
prejudices
or
the
exigencies
of
venal
journalism
assert
is
nothing
but
a
consequence
of
socialism
while
in
fact
it
is
the
practical
negation
of
socialism
finally
as
a
synthetic
conclusion
i
think
it
worth
while
to
show
that
while
in
the
beginning
of
his
book
garofalo
starts
out
in
open
hostility
to
socialism
with
the
intention
of
maintaining
an
absolutely
uncompromising
attitude
declaring
on
the
first
page
that
he
has
written
his
book
for
those
who
are
called
the
bourgeois
in
order
to
dissuade
them
from
the
concessions
which
they
themselves
in
their
own
minds
can
not
prevent
themselves
from
making
to
the
undeniable
truth
of
the
socialist
ideal
when
he
reaches
the
end
of
his
polemic
the
irresistible
implications
of
the
facts
force
garofalo
to
a
series
of
eclectic
compromises
which
produce
on
the
reader
after
so
many
accusations
and
threats
of
repression
the
depressing
impression
of
a
mental
collapse
as
unforeseen
as
it
is
significant
indeed
garofalo
on
page
recognizes
the
usefulness
of
combinations
of
laborers
to
enable
them
to
unjust
demands
and
even
declares
it
obligatory
upon
to
assure
a
to
their
laborers
who
have
served
them
long
p
and
he
demands
for
the
laborers
at
all
events
a
share
in
the
profits
he
recognizes
also
that
the
adult
out
of
work
and
in
good
health
has
the
right
to
assistance
no
less
than
the
sick
man
or
the
cripple
garofalo
who
by
all
these
restrictions
to
his
absolute
individualism
has
permitted
himself
to
make
concessions
to
socialism
which
are
in
flagrant
contradiction
with
his
announced
intention
and
to
the
whole
trend
of
his
book
ends
indeed
by
confessing
that
if
the
new
socialists
were
to
preach
collectivism
within
the
sphere
of
agricultural
it
would
at
least
be
possible
to
discuss
it
since
one
would
not
be
confronted
at
the
outset
by
an
absurdity
as
is
the
case
in
attempting
to
discuss
universal
collectivism
this
is
not
equivalent
to
saying
that
agricultural
collectivism
would
be
put
into
practice
that
is
to
say
that
there
is
room
for
compromises
and
that
a
mitigated
collectivism
would
not
be
in
contradiction
with
all
the
laws
of
science
a
contradiction
which
it
seems
his
entire
argument
was
intended
to
establish
for
garofalo
confines
himself
to
remarking
that
the
realization
of
collectivism
in
land
would
not
be
a
fact
that
no
socialist
has
ever
disputed
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
point
out
once
more
how
this
method
of
combating
socialism
on
the
part
of
garofalo
resemble
that
which
the
classical
criminologists
employed
against
the
positivist
school
when
after
so
many
sweeping
denials
of
our
teachings
they
came
to
admit
that
nevertheless
some
of
our
inductions
for
example
the
anthropological
classification
of
criminals
might
well
be
applied
on
a
reduced
scale
in
the
administration
of
jails
and
penitentiaries
but
never
in
the
provisions
of
the
criminal
law
during
many
years
as
a
defender
of
the
positivist
school
of
criminology
i
have
had
personal
experience
of
the
inevitable
phases
that
must
be
passed
through
by
a
scientific
truth
before
its
final
triumph
the
conspiracy
of
silence
the
attempt
to
smother
the
new
idea
with
ridicule
then
in
consequence
of
the
resistance
to
these
artifices
of
reactionary
conservatism
the
new
ideas
are
misrepresented
through
ignorance
or
to
facilitate
assaults
upon
them
and
at
last
they
are
partially
admitted
and
that
is
the
beginning
of
the
final
triumph
so
that
knowing
these
phases
of
the
natural
evolution
of
every
new
idea
now
when
for
the
second
time
instead
of
resting
upon
the
laurels
of
my
first
scientific
victories
i
have
wished
to
fight
for
a
second
and
more
radical
heresy
this
time
the
victory
appears
to
me
more
certain
since
my
opponents
and
my
former
companions
in
arms
again
call
into
use
against
it
the
same
artifices
of
reactionary
opposition
whose
impotence
i
had
already
established
on
a
narrower
but
one
where
the
conflict
was
neither
less
keen
nor
less
difficult
and
so
a
new
recruit
enlisted
to
fight
for
a
grand
and
noble
human
ideal
i
behold
even
now
the
spectacle
of
partial
and
inevitable
concessions
being
wrung
from
those
who
still
pretend
to
maintain
a
position
of
uncompromising
and
unbending
hostility
but
who
are
helpless
before
the
great
cry
of
suffering
and
hope
which
springs
from
the
depths
of
the
masses
of
mankind
in
passionate
emotion
and
in
intellectual
striving
