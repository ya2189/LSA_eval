preface
as
a
rule
an
author
writes
a
preface
to
explain
or
to
apologize
for
a
book
i
shall
do
neither
i
have
tried
to
explain
my
meaning
simply
and
clearly
in
the
book
itself
and
i
am
optimistic
enough
to
think
that
my
favourite
game
is
too
popular
to
require
an
apology
for
increasing
its
literature
however
unpretentious
the
attempt
may
be
moreover
i
am
still
too
much
affected
by
the
brilliant
and
feverish
glow
of
enthusiasm
to
dream
of
offering
one
two
things
only
i
wish
to
say
first
that
i
am
writing
with
no
academic
pride
but
only
with
a
passionate
fondness
for
what
i
consider
a
great
sport
and
with
a
keen
desire
to
make
others
equally
devoted
secondly
i
should
like
to
thank
all
those
who
have
assisted
me
with

chapter
i
athletics
for
girls
i
hope
and
believe
there
are
comparatively
few
people
who
will
deny
that
athletics
have
done
much
for
the
health
and
mind
of
the
modern
girl
exercise
in
some
form
or
other
is
essential
and
although
i
am
quite
ready
to
admit
that
games
of
the
strenuous
type
such
as
hockey
and
lawn
tennis
can
be
and
sometimes
are
overdone
yet
the
girl
of
who
enters
into
and
enjoys
her
game
with
scarcely
less
zest
than
her
brother
is
i
am
convinced
better
in
health
and
happier
in
herself
than
the
girl
of
the
past
generation
what
are
the
objections
to
games
for
girls
it
seems
to
me
the
chief
arguments
against
them
are
that
they
are
injurious
to
health
that
they
impair
the
womanliness
of
woman
that
they
mar
her
appearance
there
may
be
something
to
be
said
for
these
contentions
but
to
my
mind
the
materially
outweigh
the
as
to
the
injury
to
health
i
deny
that
the
case
is
proved
indeed
evidence
is
rarely
forthcoming
a
delicate
girl
would
probably
become
more
delicate
if
she
did
not
play
games
in
moderation
and
take
exercise
a
friend
of
mine
an
old
doctor
told
me
the
other
day
that
in
his
youth
the
great
plague
of
his
life
was
the
hysterical
female
she
would
put
in
an
appearance
obtrusively
at
critical
moments
and
the
anticipation
of
a
scene
always
shadowed
his
arrangements
we
rarely
see
this
type
now
games
have
driven
her
away
the
woman
of
the
present
generation
is
calm
collected
and
free
from
emotional
outbursts
and
i
believe
that
invigorating
outdoor
exercise
is
the
chief
cause
as
to
the
second
objection
the
injury
to
the
womanliness
of
woman
the
answer
depends
on
what
is
meant
by
the
essential
feature
of
womanliness
i
am
afraid
most
people
including
most
men
say
with
hamlet
frailty
thy
name
is
woman
womanliness
to
most
men
implies
just
frailty
they
may
perhaps
call
it
delicacy
and
refer
to
the
weaker
sex
but
they
mean
that
just
as
a
man
glory
is
his
strength
so
a
woman
glory
is
her
weakness
they
argue
that
you
must
impair
this
weakness
by
strenuous
games
is
this
true
is
the
essential
feature
of
a
woman
her
weakness
just
as
the
essential
feature
of
a
man
is
his
strength
not
merely
physical
but
mental
and
moral
strength
i
do
not
think
so
woman
is
a
second
edition
of
man
if
you
will
therefore
like
most
second
editions
an
improvement
on
the
first
as
lessing
puts
it
nature
meant
to
make
woman
its
masterpiece
i
well
remember
reading
in
a
stirring
narrative
of
the
indian
mutiny
how
a
small
party
of
english
men
and
women
were
besieged
in
their
quarters
by
a
body
of
rebels
and
while
the
men
fought
at
the
windows
and
doors
the
women
were
busy
preparing
ammunition
loading
guns
bandaging
wounds
and
zealously
cheering
their
defenders
when
victory
was
at
length
achieved
the
men
asked
themselves
what
would
have
happened
but
for
the
women
that
to
my
mind
was
a
picture
of
true
womanliness
inferior
in
neither
moral
strength
nor
the
true
woman
is
a
helpmeet
or
man
complement
giving
him
just
the
special
form
of
strength
in
body
and
soul
that
he
needs
for
the
special
experience
if
this
then
be
womanliness
can
athletic
games
injure
it
do
they
spoil
woman
usefulness
as
a
woman
do
they
damage
her
specific
excellence
do
they
tend
to
give
her
less
endurance
and
nerve
at
critical
times
i
do
not
think
so
certainly
lawn
tennis
does
not
it
is
undoubtedly
a
strenuous
game
there
is
more
energy
of
physical
frame
more
and
demanded
in
one
hardly
contested
match
than
would
suffice
for
a
whole
day
devotion
to
many
other
games
these
requirements
must
help
a
woman
and
in
the
possession
of
the
qualities
that
games
bestow
athletic
girls
have
a
great
pull
over
their
sisters
if
you
are
skilled
and
well
drilled
in
discipline
and
sportsmanship
you
are
bound
to
benefit
in
the
strife
of
the
world
you
are
the
better
able
to
face
disappointments
and
sorrows
for
what
do
these
strenuous
games
mean
exercise
in
the
open
air
and
exercise
of
a
thorough
and
engrossing
character
carried
out
with
cheerful
and
stimulating
surroundings
with
scientific
methods
rational
aims
and
absorbing
chances
surely
that
is
the
foundation
of
health
culture
the
truth
is
games
have
done
for
women
what
the
dervish
subtle
prescription
did
for
the
sick
sultan
you
perhaps
remember
the
story
the
sultan
having
very
bad
health
from
sedentary
habits
and
luxurious
ease
consulted
the
clever
dervish
the
dervish
knew
that
it
would
be
useless
to
recommend
the
sultan
simply
to
take
exercise
he
therefore
said
to
him
here
is
a
ball
which
i
have
stuffed
with
certain
rare
and
costly
medicinal
herbs
and
here
is
a
bat
the
handle
of
which
i
have
also
stuffed
with
similar
herbs
your
highness
must
take
this
bat
and
with
it
beat
about
this
ball
until
you
perspire
freely
you
must
do
this
every
day
his
highness
acquiesced
and
in
a
short
time
the
exercise
of
playing
bat
and
ball
with
the
dervish
greatly
improved
his
health
and
by
degrees
cured
him
of
his
ailment
now
the
tennis
ball
to
my
mind
is
stuffed
with
medicinal
herbs
which
impart
vigour
and
health
to
the
player
the
racket
is
possessed
with
a
magic
handle
that
has
the
power
of
quickening
all
the
pulses
of
life
in
the
plenitude
of
healthy
vigour
and
wholesome
excitement
in
a
medical
book
now
before
me
the
subject
is
put
tersely
thus
health
and
strength
depend
on
rapid
disorganisation
and
rapid
disorganisation
depends
on
rapid
exertion
now
if
this
is
true
what
better
and
more
interesting
method
of
rapid
exertion
could
be
devised
than
a
game
of
lawn
tennis
body
and
mind
alike
are
wholly
absorbed
with
the
utmost
rapidity
and
there
is
no
doubt
the
sense
of
refreshment
is
largely
due
to
the
rapid
exertion
demanded
for
the
proper
playing
of
the
game
the
medical
book
goes
on
to
say
during
exertion
we
drink
as
it
were
oxygen
from
the
air
this
oxygen
is
the
only
stimulating
drink
we
can
take
with
lasting
advantage
to
ourselves
for
the
purpose
of
invigorating
our
strength
it
is
the
wine
and
spirit
of
life
an
abundance
of
which
nature
has
supplied
us
with
if
you
are
drink
oxygen
take
active
exercise
in
the
open
air
and
inhale
it
when
next
you
see
a
lawn
tennis
player
hard
at
a
strenuous
game
remember
he
or
she
is
not
necessarily
overstraining
or
injuring
health
but
taking
long
deep
draughts
of
oxygen
imbibing
the
wine
and
spirit
of
life
and
laying
up
a
store
of
vigour
in
readiness
for
the
varied
experiences
of
life
of
all
games
lawn
tennis
is
the
one
most
suited
to
girls
its
claims
are
many
and
potent
it
is
strenuous
and
very
hard
work
but
if
not
overdone
it
is
not
too
taxing
for
the
average
girl
the
exercise
depends
naturally
upon
the
nature
of
the
game
played
and
the
players
engaged
from
the
championships
to
the
patball
game
the
greater
the
knowledge
of
the
game
the
greater
the
enjoyment
and
benefit
derived
from
it
and
there
is
really
no
reason
why
a
girl
should
not
excel
at
the
game
and
therefore
thoroughly
appreciate
and
enjoy
it
it
is
not
physical
and
brute
strength
that
is
wanted
so
much
as
scientific
application
finesse
skill
and
delicacy
of
touch
all
of
which
women
are
just
as
capable
of
exercising
as
men
i
am
well
aware
that
if
you
compare
the
lady
champion
of
any
year
with
any
man
of
the
same
year
you
will
find
a
great
disparity
between
their
actual
play
that
is
to
say
the
man
would
be
able
to
give
the
lady
champion
thirty
or
even
more
in
order
to
have
a
close
struggle
i
have
often
played
doherty
at
the
tremendous
odds
of
receive
and
have
not
always
been
returned
the
winner
at
that
i
wonder
sometimes
why
there
is
this
pronounced
discrepancy
garments
may
make
a
little
difference
but
they
do
not
account
for
it
all
i
think
perhaps
that
man
stronger
physique
naturally
greater
activity
and
severer
strokes
prevent
the
girl
from
playing
her
own
game
she
has
to
be
nearly
always
on
the
defensive
and
thus
plays
with
less
accuracy
and
power
another
claim
lawn
tennis
has
for
girls
is
that
it
is
not
an
expensive
game
it
is
more
or
less
within
the
reach
of
all
rich
or
poor
it
can
be
played
on
one
own
lawn
or
at
any
of
the
numerous
clubs
situated
all
over
the
world
or
even
nowadays
in
some
of
the
public
parks
the
time
required
to
play
a
game
is
not
excessive
the
implements
rackets
balls
nets
are
neither
numerous
nor
prohibitive
in
price
the
club
subscriptions
are
moderate
and
the
actual
expenses
of
pursuing
the
game
are
small
as
compared
with
golf
illustration
wimbledon
miss
may
sutton
winning
the
championship
for
the
first
time
she
beat
miss
douglass
in
the
challenge
round
then
again
lawn
tennis
is
not
difficult
to
learn
although
of
course
by
this
i
do
not
mean
that
it
is
an
easy
game
to
play
well
far
from
it
but
a
rudimentary
idea
of
it
suffices
to
give
any
one
a
good
deal
of
healthy
exercise
and
enjoyment
and
provided
that
one
is
keen
and
wishes
to
improve
and
possesses
what
is
known
as
a
good
games
eye
there
is
no
reason
why
advance
should
not
be
rapid
it
is
also
a
pastime
in
which
women
can
combine
with
and
compete
against
men
without
in
any
way
spoiling
the
game
and
mixed
doubles
to
which
i
refer
are
perhaps
the
most
popular
department
with
the
average
spectator
i
think
i
am
not
wrong
in
saying
that
there
is
no
other
game
at
the
present
time
in
which
this
combination
of
the
sexes
does
not
tend
to
minimize
the
enjoyment
of
the
player
and
the
interest
of
the
spectator
a
mixed
foursome
at
golf
is
poor
sort
of
fun
for
the
man
unless
the
ladies
are
quite
the
game
is
rather
spoilt
for
him
mixed
hockey
is
an
abomination
splendid
sport
absolutely
spoiled
for
both
sexes
but
a
mixed
double
at
lawn
tennis
seems
like
a
distinct
game
so
different
is
it
to
the
other
forms
of
lawn
tennis
and
so
well
adapted
to
the
combination
of
both
sexes
then
it
is
asserted
that
strenuous
games
mar
the
appearance
of
girls
this
charge
was
very
deliberately
brought
against
hockey
for
women
some
little
time
ago
in
an
influential
london
journal
and
was
rightly
and
promptly
answered
by
a
spirited
article
with
illustrations
of
some
lady
hockey
players
proof
positive
of
the
fallacy
that
hockey
damaged
their
appearance
i
am
afraid
most
of
these
contortions
are
the
product
of
the
snapshot
camera
it
must
be
remembered
that
instantaneous
photographs
show
players
of
games
as
they
are
really
never
seen
girls
are
doubtless
in
the
ungraceful
position
represented
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
but
the
time
is
too
short
for
the
eye
to
see
although
the
camera
worse
luck
catches
the
view
and
what
is
more
registers
it
for
ever
though
a
girl
should
always
try
to
be
as
neat
and
look
as
nice
as
she
possibly
can
even
when
playing
a
strenuous
game
it
is
hardly
possible
or
natural
to
be
just
so
every
second
of
a
long
struggle
in
fact
i
think
it
is
more
interesting
to
see
a
girl
not
absolutely
immobile
i
prefer
that
she
should
show
some
signs
of
excitement
that
her
muscles
should
be
strained
and
her
face
set
this
has
a
very
real
pleasure
of
its
own
and
i
do
not
think
it
unsightly
public
speaking
and
singing
may
distort
the
mouth
and
disturb
the
facial
muscles
to
a
most
ludicrous
extent
and
give
the
eyes
quite
an
unnatural
appearance
but
i
have
never
yet
heard
it
said
that
a
man
or
woman
should
give
up
either
because
of
its
effect
upon
the
appearance
why
then
should
women
abandon
athletic
exercises
which
they
enjoy
so
much
and
which
do
them
so
much
good
merely
because
just
for
a
moment
or
two
perhaps
their
appearance
is
distorted
chapter
ii
practice
and
how
to
improve
players
even
tournament
players
often
ask
how
they
can
improve
i
have
been
at
the
same
stage
so
long
what
can
i
do
to
play
a
better
game
that
is
not
infrequently
the
question
now
i
think
many
who
are
very
anxious
to
advance
go
to
work
in
the
wrong
way
to
my
mind
the
great
point
to
remember
when
you
are
practising
is
not
that
the
match
must
be
won
but
that
all
your
weak
strokes
must
be
improved
we
all
know
our
special
failures
if
not
some
kind
friend
will
soon
point
them
out
to
us
tackle
these
doggedly
in
practice
strokes
naturally
avoided
in
a
match
should
be
given
as
much
experience
as
possible
in
a
game
it
is
the
only
way
many
players
make
the
cardinal
mistake
of
playing
day
after
day
in
the
same
way
they
starve
all
their
weak
strokes
and
overdo
all
their
best
ones
in
fact
they
play
in
precisely
the
same
manner
as
if
the
occasion
were
an
important
match
if
you
do
this
you
must
always
preserve
those
weak
strokes
they
are
not
even
given
a
chance
to
develop
i
once
asked
a
girl
whom
i
noticed
continually
running
round
her
in
a
practice
game
why
she
did
this
the
characteristic
answer
came
back
i
can
not
take
a
back
hand
i
should
be
hopelessly
beaten
if
i
did
run
round
the
ball
but
what
does
it
matter
if
you
are
beaten
fifty
times
in
a
practice
game
if
you
are
improving
your
strokes
that
girl
could
never
improve
she
made
absolutely
no
distinction
between
a
practice
game
and
a
match
in
fact
it
was
very
little
of
a
game
to
her
how
can
your
game
improve
or
move
forward
if
you
make
no
effort
to
strengthen
what
is
feeble
practise
then
conscientiously
and
with
infinite
patience
never
mind
who
beats
you
take
each
weak
stroke
in
turn
and
determine
to
master
it
and
i
think
you
will
find
that
you
will
be
amply
rewarded
for
all
your
painstaking
work
by
a
vast
improvement
and
keener
enjoyment
in
your
game
what
greater
delight
than
to
feel
a
stroke
you
have
always
dreaded
becoming
easier
and
less
embarrassing
each
time
you
use
it
to
know
that
you
are
genuinely
advancing
instead
of
making
no
progress
and
playing
the
same
old
bad
shots
time
after
time
i
am
sure
you
will
say
such
a
sense
of
achievement
is
worth
all
the
trouble
which
must
be
faced
and
all
the
patience
which
must
be
exercised
of
course
in
match
play
it
is
quite
different
you
avoid
your
weak
strokes
as
much
as
you
can
your
object
then
is
to
win
the
game
but
after
discriminate
practice
you
will
find
probably
to
your
surprise
that
there
are
not
so
many
weak
spots
after
all
to
remove
that
your
game
is
opening
out
and
steadily
advancing
do
not
get
easily
disheartened
if
you
find
improvement
slow
for
a
game
that
is
worth
playing
at
all
is
worth
playing
well
and
to
play
lawn
tennis
well
you
must
go
through
a
stiff
apprenticeship
you
must
school
yourself
to
meet
disappointments
and
failures
you
must
cultivate
a
philosophic
spirit
or
you
will
never
reach
the
goal
of
perfection
i
need
not
say
that
if
you
wish
to
go
forward
enthusiasm
is
essential
lawn
tennis
players
never
seem
to
me
to
be
nearly
so
keen
on
their
game
as
golfers
so
many
of
them
appear
quite
satisfied
to
remain
at
a
fixed
stage
they
will
certainly
not
get
their
handicap
reduced
unless
there
is
an
ardent
desire
to
become
better
acquainted
with
the
science
of
the
game
a
struggling
golfer
is
never
tired
of
learning
talking
about
his
pastime
often
i
admit
to
the
annoyance
of
people
who
are
not
so
obsessed
nevertheless
he
is
on
the
right
track
and
being
so
thoroughly
absorbed
and
in
earnest
he
ought
to
improve
you
will
find
him
buying
every
new
book
that
comes
out
and
poring
over
its
pages
he
may
play
in
a
few
competitions
but
his
time
is
more
seriously
occupied
with
practice
and
improvement
he
wisely
deprecates
the
continuous
strain
of
match
play
he
prefers
to
acquire
a
working
knowledge
of
the
game
to
make
the
various
strokes
with
some
degree
of
accuracy
before
he
pits
his
skill
against
others
i
think
this
lack
of
adequate
practice
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
there
is
such
a
dearth
of
rising
talent
among
lawn
tennis
players
some
of
the
competitors
one
meets
at
tournaments
have
been
for
years
at
exactly
the
same
stage
they
never
pause
to
take
stock
of
their
game
they
never
advance
or
cultivate
a
new
stroke
they
go
from
one
tournament
to
another
struggling
to
win
by
hook
or
by
crook
assisted
by
a
generous
handicap
they
may
win
a
prize
and
apparently
they
are
satisfied
let
me
say
in
regard
to
tournaments
that
when
you
are
taking
your
strokes
correctly
and
are
really
adding
to
your
knowledge
of
the
game
open
competitions
are
admirable
and
are
essential
if
the
highest
honours
are
to
be
achieved
but
tournaments
can
very
easily
be
overdone
especially
by
young
players
who
have
not
completed
what
i
may
call
when
you
are
practising
remember
to
practise
as
well
as
strokes
cultivate
thinking
about
the
game
never
mind
asking
an
experienced
player
for
advice
most
people
who
play
the
game
well
are
anxious
that
every
one
should
improve
they
want
them
to
get
more
enjoyment
out
of
the
game
and
they
want
the
general
standard
of
play
to
advance
as
a
rule
they
never
mind
giving
a
helpful
hint
do
not
hesitate
therefore
to
ask
for
that
help
discuss
the
game
with
your
friends
and
find
out
all
you
can
about
it
read
all
the
excellent
books
that
have
been
written
on
the
game
from
time
to
time
i
have
often
noticed
that
beginners
will
willingly
pay
their
entrance
fees
for
open
events
at
tournaments
when
they
know
very
well
that
nothing
but
a
miracle
will
take
them
through
the
first
round
yet
the
same
players
grumble
at
the
expense
of
purchasing
books
dealing
with
the
game
the
book
would
most
probably
help
them
a
great
deal
whereas
the
one
solitary
match
does
them
no
good
it
is
over
so
quickly
the
difference
in
the
class
of
play
is
so
great
that
the
beginner
hardly
hits
the
ball
at
all
a
good
way
of
practising
is
to
play
up
against
a
brick
wall
in
my
own
case
i
found
the
method
very
useful
it
helps
one
to
keep
the
eye
on
the
ball
to
time
well
and
place
with
accuracy
another
good
way
of
practising
is
not
to
score
but
to
get
some
friend
to
hit
or
even
throw
the
ball
where
you
want
it
systematic
like
this
for
half
an
hour
a
day
finishing
up
with
a
game
which
brings
into
play
the
stroke
you
have
been
developing
is
bound
to
improve
your
game
i
know
of
one
champion
of
england
who
always
practised
in
this
way
any
new
stroke
that
had
to
be
mastered
was
passed
through
the
mill
and
assiduously
exercised
until
perfection
came
if
no
friend
were
available
for
the
purpose
the
butler
had
to
devote
an
hour
a
day
to
throwing
the
ball
in
the
given
direction
to
come
to
the
various
strokes
i
do
not
mean
to
enter
into
these
elaborately
there
are
now
so
many
good
books
in
the
market
that
deal
exhaustively
with
this
subject
such
as
the
complete
player
by
wallis
myers
that
i
shall
not
aim
at
covering
old
ground
the
first
and
foremost
stroke
to
be
learnt
is
a
good
is
one
of
the
chief
assets
of
the
game
a
good
length
must
be
one
of
the
first
things
to
cultivate
the
ball
must
be
sent
as
near
the
base
line
as
possible
do
not
at
first
try
to
get
a
severe
shot
but
practise
getting
a
slow
ball
until
you
are
very
accurate
at
that
you
will
find
that
pace
and
direction
will
come
afterwards
when
making
a
drive
stand
sideways
to
the
net
your
left
shoulder
should
face
the
net
your
left
foot
should
be
in
front
of
your
right
wait
as
long
as
possible
for
the
ball
by
this
i
mean
do
not
rush
in
to
it
wait
for
it
to
come
to
you
stand
well
away
from
it
sideways
and
lengthways
swing
your
racket
slowly
back
to
about
the
level
of
your
shoulder
then
bring
it
slowly
forward
and
simultaneously
transfer
your
weight
from
your
right
foot
to
your
left
this
transference
of
weight
let
me
add
is
most
important
and
can
only
be
achieved
by
careful
practice
if
it
is
transferred
too
soon
or
too
late
the
whole
power
of
the
stroke
is
lost
illustration
the
drive
beginning
middle
finish
the
ball
must
be
hit
firmly
and
cleanly
with
the
centre
of
the
racket
feel
as
if
you
were
literally
sweeping
it
along
your
movement
must
be
so
perfectly
timed
to
the
place
you
wish
it
to
go
not
forgetting
to
follow
well
through
with
your
arm
and
shoulder
in
a
line
with
the
flight
of
the
ball
great
muscular
strength
is
not
needed
to
play
well
your
stroke
transferring
your
weight
at
the
right
moment
and
following
well
through
at
the
these
are
the
chief
secrets
of
good
and
powerful
strokes
do
not
be
content
merely
to
watch
the
ball
but
keep
your
eye
fixed
on
it
until
the
last
possible
moment
following
it
right
on
to
the
centre
of
your
racket
until
you
have
tried
this
you
can
not
realize
how
difficult
it
is
or
how
greatly
it
will
improve
your
stroke
and
it
helps
to
complete
concentration
which
to
my
mind
is
one
of
the
chief
attributes
of
success
is
taken
in
the
same
way
as
the
only
with
your
position
reversed
here
too
you
must
not
face
the
net
but
stand
sideways
this
time
your
right
shoulder
must
face
the
net
the
position
of
your
feet
for
a
stroke
is
most
important
it
is
where
so
many
beginners
go
wrong
take
a
step
towards
the
ball
with
your
right
foot
in
front
of
your
left
and
with
your
weight
at
the
start
of
the
stroke
on
the
ball
of
your
left
foot
swing
your
racket
well
back
with
its
head
raised
above
your
wrist
and
hit
the
ball
firmly
with
the
centre
of
your
racket
be
transferring
your
weight
all
the
time
from
your
left
foot
to
your
right
and
follow
well
through
in
the
direction
of
the
flight
of
the
ball
when
playing
a
across
the
court
from
corner
to
corner
let
your
arm
and
shoulder
on
the
follow
through
be
extended
as
far
as
they
will
go
and
your
body
brought
round
to
face
the
net
illustration
the
drive
beginning
middle
finish
is
a
most
important
and
useful
stroke
and
should
be
constantly
practised
it
is
by
no
means
an
easy
stroke
to
play
really
well
and
accurately
it
is
generally
a
defensive
shot
and
makes
your
opponent
move
from
the
net
unless
she
intends
to
be
beaten
by
it
i
am
speaking
of
course
of
the
singles
game
it
is
a
useful
stroke
for
giving
you
breathing
time
if
you
are
made
to
run
about
much
or
for
enabling
you
to
get
back
into
position
if
you
have
been
forced
out
of
it
it
is
nearly
always
best
to
lob
to
your
opponent
since
the
majority
of
players
are
weaker
there
there
are
three
kinds
of
lobs
high
sent
well
out
of
reach
of
your
opponent
racket
but
with
the
disadvantage
of
taking
some
time
to
reach
the
ground
although
it
moves
your
opponent
out
of
her
dangerous
position
right
up
at
the
net
there
is
time
for
her
to
run
back
and
return
it
low
which
only
just
passes
over
your
opponent
racket
a
much
more
risky
shot
than
the
high
lob
but
with
the
advantage
of
falling
much
quicker
if
you
succeed
in
getting
the
ball
out
of
her
reach
it
is
almost
certain
to
be
a
winning
shot
because
she
will
not
have
time
to
turn
and
go
after
what
is
a
very
ball
is
one
of
the
prettiest
strokes
and
a
most
effective
one
it
is
very
difficult
to
accomplish
with
success
there
is
always
great
risk
of
not
getting
it
out
of
your
opponent
reach
and
having
it
killed
outright
it
is
generally
played
with
an
stroke
by
hitting
the
ball
before
it
has
reached
the
ground
and
lifting
it
well
over
your
opponent
head
it
should
be
a
high
lob
the
racket
must
be
grasped
firmly
and
held
nearly
horizontal
for
this
stroke
in
playing
lobs
the
racket
must
come
well
underneath
the
ball
which
should
be
struck
very
truly
in
the
centre
of
the
racket
half
this
stroke
has
great
possibilities
and
is
efficacious
both
in
attack
and
defence
although
chiefly
used
for
defence
the
ball
must
be
hit
immediately
after
it
has
bounced
in
fact
within
a
few
inches
after
its
impact
with
the
ground
for
attacking
it
can
easily
be
seen
how
useful
this
stroke
can
become
the
time
gained
as
compared
to
waiting
for
the
ground
stroke
is
invaluable
but
it
wants
a
perfect
eye
to
play
it
with
any
facility
the
majority
of
players
do
not
watch
the
ball
long
enough
lack
of
confidence
is
another
reason
why
this
stroke
is
not
used
more
on
the
offensive
short
drop
from
the
back
of
the
court
or
in
fact
from
any
position
in
the
court
but
i
think
more
effectively
used
from
the
back
of
the
court
is
a
very
paying
stroke
to
have
at
your
command
it
is
difficult
to
be
accurate
with
this
shot
and
it
needs
much
patient
practice
yet
it
is
one
on
which
trouble
may
very
profitably
be
expended
for
it
often
turns
the
tide
at
a
critical
moment
i
remember
playing
one
match
where
i
used
this
stroke
a
great
deal
owing
to
its
success
my
opponent
never
even
attempted
to
reach
it
i
won
ace
after
ace
at
the
end
of
the
match
my
opponent
indignantly
upbraided
me
i
can
not
admire
your
length
she
protested
neither
did
she
think
it
was
fair
to
play
sneaks
adding
anybody
could
win
if
they
cared
to
play
like
that
in
her
opinion
it
was
tennis
afraid
i
did
not
take
this
censure
very
seriously
as
the
object
of
the
game
is
to
put
the
ball
as
far
out
of
reach
of
your
opponent
as
possible
i
could
not
see
what
difference
there
was
between
making
her
run
from
side
to
side
of
the
or
to
the
net
and
back
again
both
methods
as
regards
placing
are
just
as
good
tennis
and
should
be
used
judiciously
in
turn
but
this
sort
of
argument
did
not
appeal
to
my
opponent
she
still
thought
any
one
could
win
who
cared
to
play
that
unsporting
game
perhaps
the
incident
caused
her
to
think
a
little
and
it
may
be
she
tried
the
stroke
in
her
next
match
if
so
i
am
quite
sure
she
did
not
find
it
so
easy
to
play
accurately
as
she
had
imagined
the
danger
of
this
stroke
is
that
unless
it
is
just
in
the
right
spot
instead
of
giving
you
an
advantage
it
will
be
a
very
easy
ball
for
your
opponent
to
score
off
if
it
is
short
it
will
find
the
net
if
hit
too
far
it
becomes
a
ball
and
will
get
the
punishment
it
deserves
it
is
difficult
to
explain
how
this
stroke
should
be
played
i
think
it
is
best
to
stand
very
close
to
the
ball
and
get
rather
in
front
of
it
drawing
the
racket
across
it
from
right
to
left
stroking
the
ball
as
it
were
rather
than
hitting
it
it
requires
a
delicate
touch
and
can
be
very
deceptively
played
your
opponent
is
kept
in
the
dark
until
the
last
moment
when
the
ace
has
probably
been
won
i
should
as
a
rule
advise
an
overhead
service
at
the
same
time
an
underhand
cut
service
is
very
useful
as
a
change
variety
of
stroke
and
tactics
should
always
be
encouraged
for
an
stand
sideways
to
the
net
with
your
left
foot
just
behind
the
the
left
shoulder
facing
the
net
and
the
right
foot
a
little
to
the
right
of
and
behind
the
left
throw
the
ball
high
up
over
your
right
ear
bend
your
body
well
back
and
your
right
shoulder
down
raise
the
racket
at
the
same
time
as
you
throw
up
the
ball
hit
it
with
the
centre
of
your
racket
bringing
your
body
forward
with
all
its
weight
on
to
the
ball
and
transferring
your
weight
from
the
right
foot
to
the
left
at
the
moment
of
impact
bring
your
racket
right
through
and
finish
a
little
to
the
left
of
your
left
knee
at
the
time
you
throw
the
ball
into
the
air
the
left
shoulder
must
be
facing
the
net
and
as
your
racket
hits
the
ball
and
follows
through
to
your
left
knee
your
body
should
be
brought
round
to
face
the
net
illustration
beginning
of
service
middle
of
service
do
not
at
first
attempt
a
fast
service
keep
your
ardour
down
until
you
have
gained
a
mastery
of
the
ball
and
can
vary
its
direction
place
is
always
better
than
pace
this
applies
generally
speaking
to
other
strokes
besides
the
service
try
to
cultivate
a
second
service
which
bears
a
likeness
to
the
first
that
is
to
say
if
you
have
served
a
fault
and
the
best
players
in
the
world
can
not
be
absolutely
sure
that
their
first
delivery
will
not
pitch
just
over
the
or
or
hit
the
top
of
the
net
do
not
be
contented
with
a
soft
and
guileless
second
which
has
no
length
and
which
gives
your
opponent
an
excellent
chance
of
making
a
winning
drive
most
players
are
weaker
on
their
backhand
remember
that
fact
and
place
your
ball
accordingly
it
is
a
good
plan
when
serving
from
the
court
to
aim
for
the
spot
where
the
centre
line
bisects
the
length
and
direction
will
both
be
good
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
your
opponent
will
be
required
to
move
to
make
the
return
always
a
point
in
your
favour
remember
that
variety
in
service
as
in
tactics
and
general
play
is
essential
however
fast
your
service
may
be
if
its
pace
and
placing
are
stereotyped
a
good
deal
of
its
efficacy
is
lost
since
your
adversary
knows
what
to
expect
where
to
stand
and
the
kind
of
stroke
suitable
for
return
it
is
better
to
possess
a
variety
of
slow
services
if
they
have
good
length
than
to
own
one
fast
service
which
has
no
particular
merit
except
speed
and
of
course
the
faster
the
ball
comes
off
the
racket
the
more
liable
is
it
to
go
astray
another
reason
why
you
should
temper
zeal
with
discretion
is
that
a
vigorous
service
will
tire
you
out
like
nothing
else
and
in
a
long
match
stamina
should
be
judiciously
preserved
you
never
know
when
an
extra
spurt
may
not
be
required
to
turn
the
scale
in
your
favour
i
have
often
noticed
the
difference
in
length
and
sting
between
the
service
of
some
players
at
the
beginning
of
the
match
and
in
the
third
set
and
i
am
sure
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
so
many
matches
are
ultimately
lost
after
a
promising
start
is
the
decline
in
the
service
in
its
sustained
vigour
and
in
its
length
by
the
way
why
do
many
lady
players
even
those
who
compete
at
open
tournaments
stand
several
feet
behind
the
when
serving
are
they
aware
that
the
length
of
their
service
is
probably
just
so
many
feet
short
of
what
it
ought
to
be
and
that
they
voluntarily
give
themselves
an
extra
journey
to
recover
short
returns
even
if
they
reach
them
at
all
you
will
never
find
expert
players
who
appreciate
what
i
may
call
the
geometry
of
the
court
penalise
themselves
in
this
manner
yet
the
habit
for
some
reason
or
other
would
appear
to
be
on
the
increase
for
these
strokes
the
head
of
your
racket
should
be
above
your
wrist
your
elbow
low
down
and
your
knees
slightly
bent
you
should
in
fact
stoop
so
that
your
eye
is
level
with
the
flight
of
the
ball
the
late
mahony
used
to
say
that
if
girls
would
only
bend
down
more
to
the
ball
they
would
be
able
to
volley
much
better
you
should
not
swing
back
as
far
for
a
volley
as
for
a
ground
stroke
nor
relax
a
firm
grip
of
your
racket
remembering
to
follow
through
to
the
place
you
wish
the
ball
to
go
in
overhead
work
it
is
most
important
to
remember
the
maxim
keep
your
eye
on
the
ball
watch
it
up
to
the
moment
of
striking
do
not
always
smash
every
overhead
ball
when
a
volley
will
win
the
ace
just
as
well
it
is
a
waste
of
strength
and
there
is
a
greater
risk
of
making
a
mistake
for
a
the
right
shoulder
should
be
down
and
well
under
the
ball
the
head
and
weight
well
back
the
weight
transferred
at
the
moment
of
striking
from
the
right
to
the
left
leg
the
body
balanced
with
extended
left
arm
and
the
brought
right
on
to
the
ball
as
it
is
hit
finish
to
the
left
of
your
left
knee
as
in
the
service
chapter
iii
match
and
tournament
play
when
you
have
acquired
a
certain
knowledge
of
the
game
and
can
play
the
various
strokes
in
the
correct
way
then
as
i
have
said
tournament
and
match
play
is
the
very
best
method
of
improvement
i
would
emphasize
the
need
for
a
certain
standard
of
efficiency
because
i
am
convinced
that
at
the
present
time
there
are
too
many
weak
players
competing
at
open
meetings
the
style
of
these
players
has
only
to
be
watched
to
be
condemned
and
their
knowledge
of
the
game
is
hopelessly
limited
invariably
making
strokes
in
a
wrong
way
tournament
play
only
serves
to
consolidate
weaknesses
and
check
advance
but
assuming
you
have
practised
on
sound
lines
and
are
fit
to
take
part
in
what
after
all
should
be
a
test
of
trained
skill
tournaments
will
then
be
a
great
help
to
you
you
will
more
often
than
not
play
against
better
players
than
yourself
an
advantage
denied
you
in
practice
and
against
all
varieties
of
attack
and
defence
you
have
the
chance
of
watching
matches
and
learning
at
first
hand
how
the
different
strokes
should
be
played
you
should
be
careful
however
to
limit
the
number
of
your
tournaments
especially
when
the
excitement
and
strain
are
new
to
you
otherwise
you
will
do
much
more
harm
than
good
i
am
convinced
that
generally
speaking
players
attend
too
many
meetings
instead
of
their
play
improving
it
may
deteriorate
they
run
the
fearful
risk
of
staleness
one
of
the
greatest
dangers
to
a
lawn
tennis
player
and
they
become
physically
worn
out
as
soon
as
you
find
you
are
losing
interest
in
the
game
when
it
becomes
an
effort
to
go
into
court
give
the
game
a
rest
it
is
clear
you
have
overdone
it
and
need
a
period
of
recuperation
one
or
two
tournaments
at
a
time
and
then
a
rest
to
practise
the
new
strokes
and
tactical
moves
you
have
learnt
and
seen
would
i
feel
sure
be
much
more
helpful
to
your
game
than
tournament
touring
and
some
people
advise
you
to
dismiss
the
coming
match
entirely
from
your
mind
before
going
into
court
personally
i
find
this
physically
impossible
and
i
do
not
commend
the
suggestion
i
think
it
is
much
better
to
study
your
opponent
game
before
pitting
your
own
against
it
many
matches
may
be
lost
while
you
are
finding
out
the
right
line
of
attack
therefore
i
advise
you
to
think
about
the
match
you
are
going
to
play
mentally
rehearse
your
mode
of
campaign
but
do
not
worry
over
the
possible
result
at
all
costs
it
must
not
be
allowed
to
disturb
your
sleep
the
night
before
there
is
nothing
puts
me
off
my
game
so
much
as
a
sleepless
night
as
soon
as
you
know
who
your
opponent
is
seize
every
opportunity
to
watch
her
play
get
to
know
her
strong
and
her
weak
points
and
map
out
your
plan
of
campaign
then
come
the
first
preliminaries
the
toss
for
choice
of
sides
or
service
in
choosing
your
side
you
must
take
into
consideration
the
position
of
the
sun
the
wind
the
slope
of
the
court
if
any
and
the
background
if
you
have
won
the
toss
and
do
not
mind
on
which
side
you
start
playing
and
also
have
a
good
service
elect
to
begin
the
service
if
you
have
won
the
toss
and
for
some
good
reason
do
not
wish
to
serve
first
you
can
make
your
opponent
serve
but
remember
that
you
also
give
her
choice
of
courts
one
of
the
great
things
to
remember
in
match
play
is
this
do
not
strive
to
win
outright
with
every
stroke
especially
does
this
maxim
apply
to
the
return
of
the
service
so
many
players
are
inaccurate
with
this
important
stroke
simply
because
their
sole
ambition
is
to
make
it
end
the
rest
much
better
to
work
for
your
opening
try
to
imagine
where
your
opponent
will
be
after
taking
a
certain
stroke
and
then
according
to
this
position
determine
which
is
the
best
stroke
to
play
next
it
is
similar
to
playing
chess
you
should
think
a
move
or
sometimes
two
moves
in
advance
length
variety
of
stroke
and
direction
are
the
chief
factors
in
success
when
playing
a
single
very
often
when
the
place
to
send
the
ball
is
obvious
even
to
the
spectators
it
is
just
as
obvious
to
your
opponent
and
she
will
probably
be
making
for
that
place
before
you
have
even
hit
the
ball
then
is
the
time
to
return
the
ball
not
where
every
one
your
opponent
included
anticipates
but
straight
back
to
the
original
place
that
is
the
spot
your
opponent
is
just
hurriedly
leaving
she
will
most
probably
be
beaten
by
this
simple
device
trite
though
the
hint
may
appear
always
try
to
send
the
ball
where
it
will
be
least
expected
illustration
two
pairs
who
competed
in
a
private
mixed
doubles
tournament
at
thorpe
satchville
hillyard
and
norman
brookes
miss
pinckney
and
again
i
would
urge
the
importance
of
keeping
your
whole
attention
absorbed
on
the
game
complete
concentration
is
absolutely
essential
you
lose
yourself
in
the
game
eye
mind
and
hand
all
working
together
if
you
find
that
events
transpiring
outside
the
court
are
attracting
your
attention
you
can
not
be
watching
the
ball
many
players
even
when
concentrating
take
their
eye
off
the
ball
too
soon
with
the
result
that
it
is
not
properly
timed
and
not
hit
cleanly
in
the
centre
of
the
racket
in
match
play
remember
that
a
game
is
never
lost
until
it
is
won
never
give
up
trying
matches
have
been
won
you
have
only
to
read
the
experiences
related
in
the
final
chapter
of
this
book
after
a
player
has
had
a
set
and
five
games
to
love
called
against
her
therefore
unless
the
game
is
over
it
is
never
too
far
gone
to
be
pulled
out
of
the
fire
even
if
your
opponent
requires
only
one
more
stroke
to
win
the
match
remember
how
difficult
it
often
is
to
make
that
one
illustration
miss
douglass
and
wilding
miss
eastlake
smith
and
dougherty
two
pairs
who
competed
in
a
private
mixed
doubles
tournament
at
thorpe
satchville
the
same
applies
if
you
have
a
good
lead
play
hard
the
whole
time
never
for
one
moment
slack
off
for
if
you
do
it
is
very
hard
to
get
going
again
and
you
may
find
yourself
caught
up
and
passed
at
the
post
before
you
have
a
chance
of
getting
back
into
your
stride
i
well
remember
being
a
set
up
and
five
games
to
one
against
miss
wilson
now
luard
one
year
at
newcastle
when
victory
for
me
meant
permanent
possession
of
the
challenge
cup
this
cup
was
very
valuable
for
it
had
a
splendid
list
of
names
inscribed
upon
it
it
had
been
going
for
very
many
years
miss
wilson
seemed
so
off
her
game
and
i
was
winning
so
comfortably
that
i
could
almost
see
that
cup
on
my
sideboard
but
it
was
not
to
be
at
any
rate
not
that
year
i
was
lucky
enough
to
win
the
cup
outright
in
when
it
was
even
more
valuable
as
miss
sutton
name
had
been
added
whether
i
unconsciously
slacked
off
thinking
the
match
was
mine
which
is
a
fatal
thing
to
do
at
any
time
or
whether
miss
wilson
suddenly
found
her
game
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
but
she
eventually
won
that
match
and
the
cup
and
championship
for
the
year
she
never
gave
in
but
played
most
pluckily
right
up
to
the
end
i
remember
another
match
where
the
result
hung
in
the
balance
for
some
time
i
was
playing
miss
greene
at
eastbourne
in
again
the
cup
would
be
my
own
property
if
i
won
it
i
met
miss
greene
in
the
second
round
she
won
the
first
set
and
was
five
games
to
four
in
the
second
set
and
seven
times
she
only
wanted
one
point
to
win
that
match
i
was
able
to
make
it
five
games
all
it
was
very
bad
luck
for
miss
greene
as
the
moral
effect
after
having
had
seven
chances
of
winning
the
match
was
so
great
that
it
completely
put
her
off
her
game
and
i
won
that
set
and
the
third
quite
easily
be
careful
also
when
you
are
behind
and
are
slowly
but
surely
catching
up
your
opponent
that
when
you
do
draw
level
do
not
relax
your
this
danger
is
most
insidious
and
must
be
fought
against
the
strain
and
anxiety
involved
in
catching
up
and
the
great
relief
when
you
are
games
all
provoke
a
reaction
unless
you
are
on
your
guard
a
rest
is
taken
often
involuntarily
it
is
fatal
because
before
you
realize
it
and
can
get
going
again
your
opponent
has
run
out
a
winner
this
happened
to
me
at
wimbledon
in
against
sterry
i
was
behind
the
whole
time
and
it
was
a
great
relief
in
the
second
set
to
hear
the
score
at
last
called
five
games
all
but
i
had
hardly
taken
a
breather
when
sterry
secured
the
set
by
seven
games
to
five
the
eleventh
game
i
played
almost
unconsciously
so
relieved
was
i
at
getting
on
even
terms
when
i
ought
to
have
spared
no
effort
to
win
that
critical
game
even
if
i
had
failed
these
three
matches
and
i
could
mention
many
others
show
how
important
it
is
to
play
hard
right
up
to
the
last
stroke
of
the
match
letting
nothing
put
you
off
never
losing
your
temper
taking
umpire
bad
decisions
and
all
the
little
annoyances
that
may
disturb
you
in
a
sportsmanlike
manner
keeping
your
whole
attention
in
fact
absolutely
concentrated
on
the
game
illustration
miss
may
sutton
who
won
the
ladies
championship
at
wimbledon
in
a
single
it
is
best
when
serving
to
stand
as
near
the
centre
of
the
as
possible
in
this
position
you
have
greater
command
of
your
court
and
there
is
not
so
much
scope
for
your
opponent
to
put
the
ball
out
of
your
reach
miss
may
sutton
the
american
lady
champion
and
of
england
in
her
desire
to
stand
as
near
the
centre
of
the
court
as
she
possibly
can
gets
so
close
that
umpires
find
it
very
difficult
to
tell
whether
she
is
serving
from
the
right
court
or
the
wrong
in
fact
i
think
i
am
right
in
saying
she
has
actually
been
pulled
up
for
stepping
over
the
centre
line
of
the
if
you
stand
as
close
as
she
does
you
are
liable
to
step
over
the
line
unconsciously
stand
as
near
the
centre
line
as
possible
but
without
any
risk
of
stepping
over
it
on
the
other
hand
there
are
players
who
prefer
to
serve
from
the
other
extreme
end
gore
the
present
champion
of
england
is
one
of
these
but
personally
i
can
not
see
any
advantage
in
this
position
it
seems
to
leave
so
much
open
court
of
which
your
adversary
will
not
be
slow
to
make
use
use
the
overhead
service
for
choice
but
have
an
underhand
service
ready
at
your
command
it
may
come
in
very
useful
for
a
change
remember
that
a
service
is
better
than
a
very
fast
one
and
much
less
tiring
in
a
long
match
keep
your
opponent
wondering
where
the
service
will
come
next
vary
it
as
much
as
you
possibly
can
both
as
to
pace
and
direction
be
sure
to
make
your
opponent
move
to
take
it
i
have
tried
the
american
service
but
i
think
the
strain
is
too
severe
for
the
average
girl
and
the
advantage
gained
would
be
very
slight
for
the
rest
of
your
game
would
deteriorate
owing
to
fatigue
it
places
so
much
tension
on
all
the
muscles
of
the
body
and
i
do
not
think
it
would
do
a
girl
health
any
good
to
cultivate
it
of
course
if
she
were
abnormally
strong
and
did
not
feel
the
effects
of
the
physical
effort
she
would
be
a
tower
of
strength
in
the
land
and
her
service
would
be
an
invaluable
one
i
am
not
an
advocate
of
persistent
volleying
in
a
lady
single
i
think
it
is
too
great
a
tax
on
the
physique
nor
do
i
think
it
pays
in
the
a
volleyer
to
my
mind
is
much
easier
to
play
against
than
a
and
most
of
the
players
agree
with
me
the
great
physical
exertion
entailed
in
running
continually
to
the
net
will
after
a
time
make
the
ground
strokes
weaker
and
weaker
and
you
have
good
length
to
be
able
to
come
up
and
volley
with
any
success
miss
thomson
now
larcombe
one
of
our
best
lady
volleyers
put
up
a
magnificent
game
in
the
first
set
against
miss
sutton
at
wimbledon
in
the
championship
singles
of
she
had
carefully
watched
miss
sutton
game
and
thought
out
the
best
way
to
play
her
volleying
most
judiciously
she
would
force
miss
sutton
up
to
the
net
with
a
short
drop
stroke
and
then
lobbing
over
her
head
nearly
on
to
the
take
up
a
position
at
the
net
winning
the
ace
with
a
neat
cross
volley
these
tactics
she
repeated
again
and
again
and
actually
led
by
five
games
to
two
if
she
could
have
lasted
she
must
have
won
that
match
but
she
could
not
keep
it
up
she
became
obviously
exhausted
did
not
get
up
to
the
net
quickly
enough
and
her
length
got
shorter
and
shorter
miss
sutton
eventually
won
that
set
and
the
next
easily
i
do
not
know
what
would
have
happened
if
miss
thomson
when
she
found
she
was
tiring
had
stayed
back
for
a
little
while
and
then
resumed
her
tactics
at
the
net
perhaps
she
would
have
come
much
nearer
to
victory
a
very
large
majority
of
in
singles
have
won
the
championship
and
i
think
that
fact
helps
to
prove
my
argument
miss
maud
watson
miss
rice
hillyard
the
late
miss
robb
miss
sutton
miss
boothby
and
myself
are
miss
dod
and
sterry
are
the
only
two
volleyers
every
girl
however
should
learn
how
to
volley
you
may
be
inveigled
up
to
the
net
and
you
should
then
know
how
to
play
and
place
a
volley
and
you
should
go
up
now
and
then
on
a
ball
in
of
course
it
is
different
i
think
then
a
girl
should
volley
it
will
greatly
improve
her
play
all
round
and
will
also
make
the
game
so
much
more
attractive
i
think
it
would
be
an
excellent
plan
if
ladies
doubles
were
always
played
like
men
doubles
both
players
moving
together
and
keeping
parallel
with
one
another
going
up
to
the
net
together
and
retiring
to
the
back
of
the
court
together
competitors
would
improve
their
volleying
and
the
double
instead
of
being
the
dreary
monotonous
affair
it
is
now
especially
for
the
would
be
varied
and
instructive
i
am
sure
referees
would
welcome
the
change
with
avidity
the
interminable
ladies
double
event
would
be
a
thing
of
the
past
if
we
played
the
double
with
the
new
formation
perhaps
we
should
succeed
in
the
event
at
wimbledon
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
ladies
to
volley
at
a
tournament
they
think
they
have
more
chance
of
winning
from
the
back
of
the
court
perhaps
they
have
but
they
have
much
less
chance
of
improving
their
game
and
learning
a
variety
of
strokes
miss
pinckney
started
a
great
work
in
organizing
a
volleying
league
in
which
all
ladies
who
entered
a
ladies
doubles
event
at
any
tournament
were
obliged
to
volley
a
most
successful
experiment
took
place
at
the
beckenham
tournament
miss
pinckney
and
i
played
together
at
the
reading
tournament
and
although
we
were
both
we
determined
to
go
to
the
net
we
found
at
the
end
of
the
event
which
we
won
owing
fifteen
that
we
had
both
much
improved
our
volleying
of
course
we
made
endless
mistakes
and
were
frequently
in
the
wrong
place
but
it
was
experience
so
badly
required
unfortunately
miss
pinckney
the
pioneer
did
not
play
much
last
season
and
i
think
the
ladies
have
rather
gone
back
to
their
old
ways
it
seems
a
thousand
pities
in
a
girl
has
a
very
important
part
to
play
practically
speaking
she
has
to
work
for
all
the
openings
for
her
partner
who
comes
in
and
kills
and
very
often
if
in
watching
a
mixed
double
you
are
inclined
to
think
the
man
is
doing
little
work
or
that
he
is
playing
badly
it
is
because
his
partner
is
getting
him
no
plums
she
is
playing
a
poor
length
or
not
keeping
the
ball
out
of
the
reach
of
the
opposing
man
it
is
a
good
plan
to
keep
your
head
well
down
and
of
course
your
eye
glued
on
the
ball
until
the
very
last
moment
so
that
it
makes
it
difficult
for
the
opposing
man
at
the
net
to
tell
in
which
direction
you
are
going
to
hit
the
ball
the
late
miss
robb
who
was
a
magnificent
mixed
doubles
player
used
to
play
in
this
way
men
have
told
me
it
was
impossible
to
anticipate
her
returns
keeping
your
head
down
will
also
help
you
from
getting
flurried
or
put
off
however
jumpy
the
opposing
man
is
or
however
much
he
is
running
across
you
can
always
have
a
mental
vision
of
him
to
tell
you
where
he
is
without
looking
at
him
to
play
a
mixed
double
you
must
be
able
to
lob
it
is
really
the
most
necessary
stroke
to
cultivate
a
very
good
return
of
the
opposing
service
when
both
men
are
at
the
net
is
a
lob
back
to
the
server
it
is
much
safer
than
lobbing
over
the
man
head
if
at
all
short
your
ball
will
be
instantly
killed
and
it
also
gives
your
partner
at
the
net
plenty
of
time
to
anticipate
any
kind
of
return
it
will
be
difficult
for
the
server
to
return
a
lob
out
of
your
partner
reach
the
opposing
man
at
the
net
will
not
be
able
to
do
anything
with
this
lob
it
is
quite
out
of
his
reach
and
it
would
be
useless
for
him
to
run
across
as
he
might
do
for
a
cross
drive
it
is
usually
best
i
think
for
a
lady
to
serve
down
the
centre
of
the
court
in
a
mixed
double
it
shuts
up
the
angles
of
the
court
more
and
there
is
less
risk
of
her
partner
being
passed
down
his
side
line
do
not
enter
for
too
many
events
in
a
tournament
you
may
get
thoroughly
worn
out
and
not
able
to
do
yourself
justice
in
any
and
you
would
probably
have
to
play
when
you
were
very
tired
bad
for
your
game
and
worse
still
for
your
partner
chance
in
a
double
remember
that
before
playing
an
important
match
it
is
very
injudicious
to
watch
another
game
it
is
likely
to
put
your
eye
out
if
possible
do
not
travel
by
train
just
before
playing
or
carry
anything
heavy
such
as
your
tennis
bag
for
this
will
make
your
hand
shaky
and
unsteady
to
sum
up
there
are
five
golden
rules
which
i
have
found
very
helpful
to
me
when
playing
an
important
match
i
give
them
to
you
in
the
hope
that
they
may
prove
equally
valuable
always
remember
that
constant
practice
of
these
rules
will
make
their
pursuit
natural
in
a
match
i
keep
your
eye
on
the
ball
you
have
so
often
been
told
this
i
know
and
perhaps
the
familiar
ring
about
the
advice
may
evoke
contempt
yet
unless
this
rule
is
implicitly
obeyed
you
can
not
expect
much
success
at
lawn
tennis
taking
your
eye
off
the
ball
is
the
secret
of
every
and
stroke
you
must
not
be
content
merely
to
look
at
the
ball
but
follow
it
right
on
to
your
racket
watch
it
up
to
the
actual
moment
of
striking
the
court
and
the
position
of
your
opponent
must
be
mentally
engraved
at
the
same
time
how
frequently
attentive
observation
will
reveal
a
player
lifting
his
or
her
eye
from
the
ball
a
fraction
too
soon
always
be
on
your
guard
against
this
inclination
it
is
at
first
done
almost
unconsciously
but
it
soon
becomes
a
habit
ii
keep
your
mind
on
the
game
this
is
a
most
important
rule
as
i
have
remarked
before
complete
concentration
is
absolutely
necessary
to
success
if
you
are
worried
about
anything
business
or
home
affairs
it
is
bound
to
affect
your
game
think
of
absolutely
nothing
but
the
game
you
are
at
the
moment
playing
your
whole
personality
must
be
absorbed
to
play
the
game
well
demands
the
use
not
only
of
limb
and
muscle
but
heart
eye
and
brain
the
first
rule
will
help
the
second
because
your
attention
must
be
more
or
less
fixed
on
the
game
if
you
are
carefully
watching
the
ball
the
whole
time
iii
keep
perfect
control
of
the
temper
this
rule
some
players
will
find
much
more
difficult
than
others
you
hear
of
a
person
having
the
right
temperament
for
games
of
being
naturally
imperturbable
it
is
a
priceless
quality
for
to
my
mind
it
is
half
the
battle
if
nothing
can
disturb
your
equanimity
to
be
calm
and
placid
at
critical
moments
never
to
get
excited
or
flurried
or
in
any
way
put
out
whatever
little
worries
may
turn
up
and
sometimes
these
worries
seem
endless
and
try
one
to
the
uttermost
limit
that
is
one
of
the
keys
to
fame
on
court
i
think
if
a
good
games
temperament
is
not
natural
to
you
it
can
to
a
great
extent
be
cultivated
but
it
requires
much
practice
and
an
abundance
of
and
it
is
a
very
important
quality
to
possess
because
to
lose
your
temper
or
to
be
upset
over
any
trifle
not
only
puts
you
off
your
game
but
helps
your
opponent
to
take
a
new
lease
of
life
and
encourages
her
to
play
up
harder
than
ever
she
naturally
thinks
that
if
you
are
so
upset
at
something
or
other
your
game
is
bound
to
deteriorate
and
she
will
have
a
much
better
chance
of
winning
the
match
iv
keep
your
heart
in
the
game
by
this
i
mean
do
not
get
easily
downhearted
and
discouraged
fight
pluckily
to
the
end
however
things
are
going
against
you
courage
and
pluck
are
wanted
above
all
things
to
carry
you
successfully
through
your
matches
never
say
die
however
hopeless
the
score
may
sound
against
you
if
you
are
very
done
up
try
not
to
make
it
too
obvious
your
opponent
may
be
just
as
played
out
as
you
are
seeing
your
signals
of
distress
she
will
buoy
herself
up
and
continue
the
struggle
with
renewed
hope
and
vigour
keep
your
method
on
the
move
this
maxim
is
rather
difficult
to
explain
what
i
mean
is
you
should
vary
your
manner
of
play
and
it
in
order
to
counteract
your
opponent
upset
her
usual
game
by
your
tactics
it
is
always
a
great
mistake
to
keep
up
a
method
of
attack
or
defence
if
it
is
proving
unavailing
if
necessary
keep
your
own
method
of
play
continually
on
the
change
a
change
of
tactics
has
often
meant
a
change
of
fortune
in
the
game
never
let
your
opponent
know
what
you
are
going
to
do
next
do
what
she
would
least
expect
always
try
to
make
a
stroke
give
her
plenty
of
the
strokes
you
know
she
does
like
i
have
often
felt
myself
improving
an
opponent
weak
stroke
by
pegging
away
at
it
it
gives
her
plenty
of
excellent
practice
of
course
and
when
you
find
she
is
beginning
not
to
mind
it
so
much
give
it
a
rest
when
you
go
back
to
it
you
will
probably
find
it
successful
again
use
your
brain
and
always
know
what
you
are
trying
to
do
play
with
an
object
of
attack
and
defence
do
not
merely
return
the
ball
aimlessly
let
each
stroke
have
its
little
work
to
do
to
complete
the
whole
victory
this
is
difficult
i
know
but
it
is
so
much
more
fascinating
and
is
i
am
sure
the
way
the
game
was
meant
to
be
played
there
is
much
science
that
can
be
brought
into
lawn
tennis
always
something
new
to
learn
and
that
is
the
reason
why
we
never
tire
of
playing
it
chapter
iv
rackets
courts
dress
and
training
a
good
lawn
tennis
racket
is
indispensable
indeed
to
use
a
weapon
of
inferior
make
is
to
court
failure
from
the
start
you
can
not
be
too
particular
to
have
a
really
racket
fortunately
there
are
now
so
many
good
makers
that
it
is
a
player
own
fault
if
she
is
not
suitably
equipped
it
may
be
a
little
more
expensive
to
buy
a
really
racket
but
the
few
extra
shillings
are
well
worth
while
if
you
mean
to
take
up
the
game
seriously
and
to
get
out
of
it
all
the
enjoyment
you
can
personally
i
always
play
with
a
slazenger
racket
preferring
their
make
to
any
other
but
there
are
many
other
good
manufacturers
the
weight
of
your
racket
should
vary
according
to
your
strength
of
wrist
and
should
depend
on
whether
you
volley
or
play
entirely
from
the
back
of
the
court
i
am
inclined
to
think
there
is
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
lady
players
to
use
too
light
a
racket
i
have
often
seen
them
with
a
or
these
are
too
light
and
may
be
condemned
if
you
use
a
racket
that
is
too
light
it
means
that
the
maker
has
not
been
able
to
string
it
as
tightly
as
it
ought
to
be
strung
the
frame
would
not
stand
the
tension
i
do
not
think
a
racket
should
be
lighter
than
which
is
the
normal
weight
for
ladies
myself
i
prefer
and
always
play
with
a
and
hold
that
unless
there
is
a
weakness
of
the
wrist
or
some
personal
reason
why
the
player
should
knock
off
the
extra
this
weight
is
the
best
for
ladies
to
use
i
like
my
racket
slightly
weighted
in
the
head
but
i
think
most
players
prefer
one
evenly
balanced
the
latter
may
be
recommended
to
a
beginner
the
handle
should
be
about
five
inches
in
circumference
at
least
that
is
what
i
use
and
recommend
for
a
natural
and
easy
grip
of
course
the
circumference
must
vary
a
little
according
to
the
size
of
the
hand
or
length
of
her
fingers
but
i
counsel
all
ladies
to
fight
shy
of
the
handle
that
is
abnormally
large
i
am
quite
sure
it
is
a
mistake
it
tends
to
tire
and
stiffen
the
hand
endeavour
to
standardize
your
requirements
find
out
by
careful
trial
what
weight
what
size
of
handle
and
what
stringing
suits
your
game
best
and
then
you
will
find
when
you
use
a
new
racket
for
the
first
time
that
the
tool
is
familiar
and
has
a
friendly
influence
over
your
strokes
what
more
embarrassing
experience
than
to
play
a
match
with
a
racket
you
can
not
recognize
you
should
always
take
a
racket
with
you
when
you
go
to
tournaments
it
is
like
a
pair
of
shoes
a
necessary
item
in
your
tennis
bag
in
england
with
such
variable
weather
it
is
necessary
to
play
in
the
rain
or
at
any
rate
on
a
wet
ground
and
with
sodden
balls
and
the
very
best
gut
in
the
world
can
not
stand
rough
usage
it
is
a
good
plan
too
to
take
to
tournaments
at
least
two
rackets
as
much
alike
as
possible
if
anything
goes
wrong
with
one
you
will
have
a
good
substitute
one
that
is
not
strange
to
you
always
take
great
care
of
your
rackets
they
are
very
susceptible
both
to
damp
and
excessive
dry
heat
and
should
always
be
kept
in
a
press
when
not
in
use
a
warped
frame
is
fatal
if
you
do
not
use
a
tennis
bag
your
racket
should
be
protected
in
a
waterproof
case
it
is
a
good
plan
after
use
in
the
wet
to
rub
the
surface
of
the
strings
with
a
little
beeswax
or
varnish
most
makers
keep
a
special
preservative
in
stock
and
now
for
a
few
remarks
on
dress
there
has
been
a
great
improvement
during
the
last
few
years
in
the
costumes
worn
by
those
who
take
part
in
tournaments
held
all
over
the
country
players
know
from
experience
how
to
dress
to
be
most
comfortable
and
least
hampered
by
their
clothing
but
the
less
experienced
are
wont
to
appear
in
a
trailing
skirt
trimmed
hat
and
dressy
blouse
a
most
costume
for
the
game
it
is
essential
to
remember
that
you
want
above
everything
else
free
use
of
all
your
limbs
physical
action
must
not
be
impeded
in
any
way
by
your
clothing
an
overhead
ball
which
may
require
your
arm
to
be
extended
as
far
as
it
will
go
a
low
volley
at
the
net
where
you
must
bend
down
a
run
across
the
court
or
up
to
the
net
all
these
strokes
you
must
be
able
to
perform
with
freedom
and
facility

i
advise
a
plain
gored
skirt
not
pleated
i
think
these
most
unsuitable
on
court
about
four
or
five
inches
from
the
ground
it
should
just
clear
your
ankles
and
have
plenty
of
fullness
round
the
hem
always
be
careful
that
the
hem
is
quite
level
all
round
nothing
is
more
untidy
than
a
skirt
that
dips
down
at
the
back
or
sides
dropping
at
the
back
is
a
little
trick
a
cotton
skirt
cultivates
when
it
comes
home
from
the
laundry
a
plain
shirt
without
frills
or
furbelows
if
any
trimming
at
all
tucks
are
the
neatest
a
collar
tie
and
waistband
go
to
make
an
outfit
as
comfortable
and
suitable
as
you
could
possibly
desire
the
material
that
this
plain
shirt
and
skirt
is
made
of
does
not
so
much
matter
and
must
be
according
to
the
taste
of
the
wearer
serge
flannel
and
cotton
are
the
most
popular
and
the
last
predominates
white
is
undoubtedly
the
best
colour
to
wear
it
washes
well
and
does
not
fade
and
looks
very
much
neater
on
the
court
than
a
coloured
material
i
prefer
white
shoes
and
stockings
for
i
think
it
looks
nicer
to
be
in
one
uniform
colour
but
this
is
a
matter
of
taste
some
people
urge
that
white
shoes
make
your
feet
appear
much
bigger
than
black
or
brown
i
do
not
agree
if
you
are
wearing
a
white
skirt
the
black
or
brown
shoe
must
show
up
more
distinctly
against
it
than
a
shoe
of
the
same
colour
i
have
also
heard
it
decided
that
when
girls
are
compelled
to
play
in
the
rain
or
on
dreadfully
muddy
courts
as
unfortunately
they
often
are
it
is
better
for
them
to
don
a
dark
skirt
of
thicker
material
this
seems
to
me
a
great
mistake
a
white
skirt
will
wash
well
and
it
does
not
matter
how
dirty
it
gets
so
long
as
you
do
not
have
it
trailing
in
the
mud
it
can
not
come
to
much
harm
it
looks
as
neat
as
anything
can
look
that
is
surrounded
by
rain
and
mud
a
dark
stuff
skirt
on
the
other
hand
which
many
players
use
in
wet
weather
does
not
wash
and
is
absolutely
ruined
after
a
soaking
moreover
it
is
twice
as
heavy
to
drag
about
the
court
if
you
do
not
happen
to
have
shoes
with
you
and
are
called
upon
to
play
in
the
wet
it
is
a
good
plan
to
wear
a
pair
of
men
thick
shooting
stockings
or
socks
over
your
tennis
shoes
it
is
wonderful
what
a
firm
grip
they
give
without
in
any
way
impeding
your
movements
i
find
after
having
tried
nearly
every
sort
of
shoe
for
tennis
that
the
simple
white
gymnasium
shoe
suits
me
best
most
players
use
a
proper
tennis
shoe
or
boot
with
a
thick
sole
i
have
tried
these
but
find
they
make
me
much
slower
in
court
and
are
not
as
comfortable
as
the
gym
shoe
some
people
say
the
thicker
sole
is
less
tiring
to
the
feet
but
i
find
i
am
much
less
after
a
match
when
playing
in
the
thin
shoe
there
is
less
weight
to
carry
about
of
course
thin
soles
soon
wear
through
but
then
they
have
the
advantage
of
being
very
cheap
i
pay
half
a
crown
a
pair
for
mine
and
one
can
have
several
pairs
in
use
and
can
always
replace
them
without
any
great
expense
i
think
it
is
best
if
you
can
to
play
without
any
hat
at
all
there
is
not
the
bother
of
keeping
it
on
and
it
is
much
cooler
nor
is
it
easy
to
find
a
suitable
hat
for
lawn
tennis
a
girl
hair
is
generally
a
good
safeguard
against
sunstroke
a
long
warm
coat
is
a
very
necessary
article
of
wearing
apparel
especially
for
girls
who
are
playing
in
tournaments
it
should
be
put
on
immediately
after
a
strenuous
match
however
hot
the
day
there
is
the
great
danger
when
overheated
of
contracting
a
chill
the
coat
should
be
of
a
thick
warm
material
blanket
is
very
popular
and
serviceable
and
it
should
reach
to
the
end
of
your
skirt
if
not
beyond
i
do
not
think
it
is
wise
to
wear
bracelets
when
playing
unless
they
are
plain
and
tight
to
the
wrist
although
you
might
not
think
it
ornaments
however
small
can
and
do
get
in
your
way
i
remember
one
match
that
was
entirely
lost
because
of
the
presence
of
a
gold
curb
bracelet
with
a
small
dangling
chain
attached
putting
up
her
hand
to
adjust
a
hairpin
the
owner
did
not
know
that
the
chain
had
caught
on
to
her
and
bringing
her
hand
down
quickly
the
and
most
of
the
hairpins
were
dragged
from
her
hair
the
result
was
that
the
player
who
might
easily
have
left
the
court
and
fixed
up
her
hair
again
firmly
adjusted
it
as
best
she
could
her
hair
blowing
about
in
all
directions
in
between
every
stroke
she
had
to
clutch
wildly
at
stray
portions
that
blew
across
her
face
and
into
her
eyes
this
diversion
naturally
upset
her
game
and
i
think
that
was
the
last
time
she
wore
a
bracelet
in
court
for
match
is
rather
a
difficult
subject
for
me
to
write
about
for
i
have
never
gone
in
for
proper
training
the
great
secret
is
to
keep
perennially
fit
remember
that
an
important
match
is
a
great
strain
a
challenging
test
of
stamina
to
come
through
the
ordeal
successfully
you
must
be
in
a
good
condition
of
health
if
you
are
not
you
ought
not
to
be
playing
personally
i
know
what
it
means
to
play
an
important
match
when
feeling
really
ill
honestly
it
is
not
worth
it
it
is
no
enjoyment
to
yourself
and
it
is
no
pleasure
to
your
opponent
to
beat
you
when
she
knows
you
are
unfit
besides
it
is
very
injurious
to
your
own
health
on
the
other
hand
if
you
are
in
good
condition
and
leading
a
healthy
outdoor
life
a
match
can
not
harm
you
it
is
most
beneficial
in
every
way
therefore
i
think
the
best
training
for
an
important
match
is
to
be
always
in
training
not
to
have
to
alter
your
habits
before
a
match
is
the
secret
to
change
your
diet
and
mode
of
living
suddenly
as
some
players
do
is
more
calculated
to
upset
you
than
to
make
you
fitter
for
the
ordeal
common
sense
must
of
course
be
used
for
instance
you
should
not
eat
a
heavy
meal
just
before
playing
i
generally
prefer
a
milk
pudding
of
some
sort
and
perhaps
a
little
fruit
for
lunch
if
i
have
a
match
in
the
afternoon
i
find
this
diet
very
satisfying
and
sustaining
and
of
course
much
lighter
than
meat
bananas
or
apples
go
very
well
with
the
cheese
as
i
like
this
sort
of
lunch
at
any
time
i
do
not
have
to
change
my
diet
materially
before
a
match
after
the
day
play
is
over
i
make
absolutely
no
difference
eating
for
dinner
in
the
evening
whatever
is
going
lunch
is
the
chief
meal
over
which
care
should
be
exercised
for
important
matches
generally
begin
about
two
a
heavy
meal
would
make
me
slow
and
sleepy
i
know
of
one
player
who
never
has
any
breakfast
at
all
she
may
play
hard
matches
all
the
morning
and
when
the
luncheon
interval
arrives
she
has
only
and
fruit
of
course
this
is
a
very
exceptional
case
and
i
should
not
care
to
try
it
myself
i
find
a
good
breakfast
a
necessity
before
a
long
and
hard
day
at
a
tournament
but
the
regime
certainly
suits
the
player
in
question
she
is
always
fit
and
has
great
stamina
coming
through
exhausting
matches
without
showing
the
slightest
sign
of
distress
i
need
not
add
that
sleep
is
one
of
the
chief
factors
for
making
you
feel
buoyant
and
well
if
you
have
not
had
your
right
measure
of
sleep
the
night
before
an
important
contest
you
are
greatly
handicapped
remember
too
how
necessary
it
is
to
sleep
in
a
room
with
the
windows
open
as
to
there
are
so
many
surfaces
now
used
for
the
game
such
as
grass
wood
asphalt
cement
gravel
and
sand
that
it
is
possible
to
play
the
game
all
the
year
round
under
cover
or
out
in
the
open
i
think
however
most
players
will
agree
with
me
that
a
good
grass
court
is
the
ideal
surface
for
lawn
tennis
the
sensation
of
playing
a
genuinely
hard
match
with
evenly
balanced
players
on
a
grass
court
under
ideal
weather
conditions
has
only
to
be
experienced
to
be
appreciated
it
is
then
you
realize
what
great
enjoyment
this
game
gives
to
any
one
who
loves
it
alas
the
really
good
grass
court
and
ideal
weather
are
very
hard
to
get
in
england
i
suppose
there
was
scarcely
a
day
in
that
could
be
described
as
perfect
for
lawn
tennis
and
our
good
grass
courts
are
few
and
far
between
the
climate
we
can
not
control
but
i
often
wonder
why
there
should
be
such
a
dearth
of
true
grass
courts
at
open
meetings
of
course
maintenance
involves
a
certain
amount
of
expense
but
surely
many
clubs
are
quite
well
enough
off
to
command
at
least
one
or
two
really
good
courts
can
it
be
ignorance
or
is
it
a
want
of
necessary
energy
and
constant
attention
lawn
tennis
seems
to
suffer
in
this
respect
more
than
most
games
there
are
hundreds
of
splendid
golf
greens
and
cricket
pitches
all
over
the
country
but
for
some
inexplicable
reason
a
good
grass
lawn
tennis
court
is
as
hillyard
has
remarked
almost
as
rare
a
sight
as
a
dead
donkey
happily
we
get
this
rare
spectacle
at
wimbledon
under
hillyard
able
care
and
management
illustration
group
of
players
at
the
newcastle
tournament
what
a
difference
a
general
improvement
in
surface
would
mean
i
am
convinced
that
if
courts
were
better
the
standard
of
play
would
advance
more
rapidly
it
is
marvellous
what
beneficial
effect
a
good
court
has
on
play
i
have
seen
an
average
player
who
had
always
played
on
bad
courts
with
cramped
surroundings
and
poor
background
put
up
a
really
good
game
the
very
first
time
he
played
on
a
court
i
refer
to
a
private
court
at
thorpe
satchville
perhaps
the
best
in
the
country
that
player
surprised
himself
and
every
one
else
present
he
performed
about
better
than
his
usual
game
the
moral
is
that
if
other
players
had
the
opportunity
of
playing
regularly
on
a
true
and
fast
court
they
must
essentially
improve
on
bad
courts
you
can
never
be
sure
what
the
ball
will
do
it
is
a
whether
you
get
a
false
bound
or
not
a
player
once
told
me
that
he
thought
it
a
good
thing
to
have
these
bad
courts
at
your
house
or
club
to
practise
upon
when
you
went
to
tournaments
he
argued
you
would
not
mind
what
you
found
there
as
the
conditions
could
not
be
worse
and
might
be
better
and
you
would
always
be
in
the
happy
frame
of
mind
of
not
expecting
too
much
and
never
being
disappointed
your
game
would
not
be
put
off
by
depressing
conditions
you
were
so
used
to
them
but
that
is
poor
logic
after
all
we
play
the
game
for
pleasure
and
there
can
be
no
enjoyment
in
playing
on
wretched
courts
many
unfortunate
players
if
they
wish
to
play
the
game
at
all
are
forced
to
play
on
what
mahony
used
to
call
cabbage
patches
sorry
partner
it
hopped
on
a
cabbage
was
his
favourite
expression
after
missing
a
ball
in
a
double
but
i
can
not
understand
any
one
voluntarily
choosing
such
a
surface
a
wood
floor
has
such
an
absolutely
true
bound
that
it
must
provide
very
good
practice
and
one
winter
play
on
the
indoor
courts
at
club
is
to
my
mind
a
quicker
way
of
improving
your
game
than
two
or
three
seasons
on
grass
courts
which
are
not
of
the
best
these
covered
wood
courts
are
very
scarce
and
it
is
a
thousand
pities
there
are
so
few
of
them
would
that
this
winter
game
were
in
the
reach
of
everybody
on
the
other
hand
you
can
overdo
the
game
by
playing
continuously
and
if
you
have
been
playing
all
through
the
summer
with
scarcely
a
break
it
is
a
good
plan
to
rest
during
the
winter
months
taking
up
some
other
game
to
keep
your
eye
in
and
your
condition
fit
since
true
grass
courts
are
so
scarce
in
this
country
i
sometimes
wish
we
could
dispense
with
turf
altogether
and
have
at
our
tournaments
the
same
surface
which
finds
favour
abroad
at
places
like
cannes
homburg
and
dinard
the
bound
of
the
ball
on
these
courts
is
absolutely
uniform
the
surface
being
hard
sand
one
great
advantage
they
possess
we
should
welcome
it
over
here
is
that
when
it
rains
play
is
quite
out
of
the
question
wading
about
in
the
mud
and
playing
in
a
steady
downpour
often
our
lot
in
england
is
unknown
on
the
continent
and
foreign
courts
also
dry
quickly
after
rain
and
often
play
better
for
their
watering
chapter
v
tournament
and
club
management
i
wish
an
order
of
play
could
be
used
more
at
english
tournaments
that
is
to
say
i
wish
matches
could
be
arranged
to
take
place
at
a
certain
hour
following
the
plan
adopted
at
wimbledon
and
at
all
the
meetings
on
the
continent
such
an
arrangement
would
greatly
add
to
the
comfort
and
enjoyment
of
competitors
and
would
i
imagine
be
a
great
boon
to
the
referee
spectators
i
know
would
welcome
it
i
think
a
might
prove
unworkable
where
handicap
events
are
concerned
but
in
the
case
of
open
events
i
feel
sure
it
could
be
introduced
with
great
advantage
to
all
concerned
i
have
so
often
sat
hour
after
hour
at
a
london
tournament
having
only
entered
for
the
open
events
perhaps
playing
one
match
perhaps
not
playing
at
all
if
i
had
been
told
overnight
that
i
should
not
be
wanted
or
exactly
at
what
hour
my
match
would
take
place
it
would
have
been
so
much
more
satisfactory
and
saved
so
much
wasted
time
this
waiting
about
takes
away
half
the
pleasure
of
playing
in
london
meetings
even
if
there
are
good
matches
going
on
you
do
not
care
to
watch
them
incessantly
there
may
be
a
chance
of
your
playing
off
a
tie
and
it
would
tend
to
put
your
eye
out
on
one
occasion
having
a
long
way
to
go
to
a
tournament
in
which
i
was
only
entered
for
the
open
mixed
doubles
i
telephoned
to
know
whether
i
should
be
wanted
or
not
well
replied
the
referee
if
i
call
you
and
you
are
not
on
the
ground
i
shall
scratch
you
in
your
own
interest
you
had
better
come
over
for
my
partner
sake
as
well
as
my
own
i
was
bound
to
go
as
i
expected
i
sat
the
whole
afternoon
and
evening
doing
absolutely
nothing
when
i
begged
to
be
allowed
to
play
as
i
had
come
some
distance
for
this
one
match
the
referee
examined
his
programme
and
said
oh
it
is
quite
impossible
they
have
not
played
the
round
in
front
of
you
yet
illustration

sort
of

mismanagement

resulting
in
unnecessary
wear
and
tear
for
the
competitors
if
there
was
an
order
of
play
arranged
for
each
day
all
the
bother
would
be
obviated
i
believe
that
business
men
who
can
not
get
away
in
the
early
afternoon
have
their
matches
timed
and
arranged
for
them
why
are
not
all
competitors
treated
alike
while
i
am
on
this
subject
of
waiting
about
let
me
say
that
i
think
ladies
do
not
take
nearly
enough
care
of
themselves
after
playing
they
ought
to
wrap
up
well
if
they
have
not
time
to
change
before
their
next
match
men
are
much
more
careful
they
put
on
their
coats
immediately
they
leave
the
court
and
change
their
clothes
as
soon
as
they
can
but
you
will
see
girls
chatting
after
a
match
and
even
having
tea
without
deigning
to
put
on
an
extra
wrap
it
is
courting
disaster
the
colds
and
more
dangerous
ailments
that
arise
from
this
little
want
of
care
naturally
afford
people
a
line
of
attack
when
they
object
to
girls
engaging
in
violent
exercise
you
can
not
be
too
careful
after
strenuous
play
i
am
well
aware
that
ladies
are
catered
for
very
badly
at
most
of
the
tournaments
in
regard
to
accommodation
some
places
we
have
had
to
put
up
with
are
disgraceful
i
think
most
lady
players
will
agree
with
me
when
i
say
that
wimbledon
and
queen
club
are
about
the
only
two
grounds
where
you
can
change
with
any
degree
of
comfort
this
is
not
right
and
i
am
sure
if
men
had
to
experience
the
accommodation
afforded
for
our
use
there
would
not
be
many
of
them
competing
at
tournaments
i
think
the
two
clubs
i
have
mentioned
are
the
only
two
where
we
even
get
a
bathroom
some
tournaments
provide
a
draughty
tent
for
our
use
moreover
there
is
generally
only
one
and
feminine
spectators
often
crowd
round
the
one
staring
at
the
players
as
if
they
were
animals
on
show
it
is
sometimes
even
impossible
to
sit
down
to
rest
after
a
hard
and
tiring
contest
i
appeal
to
secretaries
of
tournaments
for
some
reform
a
number
of
lady
players
have
asked
me
to
use
this
opportunity
to
point
out
some
of
our
most
pressing
grievances
i
hope
these
remarks
which
are
none
too
strong
may
bear
fruit
visitors
who
come
over
from
other
countries
are
always
loud
in
their
complaints
and
i
am
not
surprised
i
believe
the
beckenham
authorities
are
doing
all
they
can
to
impart
a
little
more
comfort
to
the
ladies
changing
and
and
they
have
greatly
improved
their
accommodation
it
is
time
other
meetings
followed
their
example
at
the
seaside
meetings
it
does
not
so
much
matter
most
of
the
players
stay
near
the
ground
and
can
go
to
their
own
rooms
and
be
back
in
time
to
play
again
if
necessary
but
in
london
tournaments
where
there
is
often
a
long
drive
or
train
journey
before
one
reaches
home
it
is
most
important
that
there
should
be
a
good
illustration
a
tournament
at
newcastle
row
left
to
the
late
miss
meyre
hillyard
hillyard
lambert
chambers
brookes
roberts
there
is
another
improvement
which
i
feel
sure
would
be
greatly
welcomed
by
competitors
and
that
is
a
separate
for
their
use
often
a
player
has
only
a
few
minutes
to
get
her
tea
and
with
the
general
public
engaged
in
the
same
amiable
pursuit
she
is
not
able
to
be
served
and
has
to
go
away
tealess
if
there
were
a
competitors
a
player
could
obtain
her
tea
in
comfort
when
she
wanted
it
always
bear
in
mind
that
a
referee
at
a
tournament
has
a
most
worrying
time
of
it
players
can
and
should
help
to
make
his
task
lighter
there
are
many
ways
in
which
they
can
assist
to
make
the
tournament
as
successful
as
possible
one
is
by
being
punctual
and
ready
dressed
to
play
when
wanted
and
another
is
by
umpiring
when
they
are
disengaged
and
have
not
an
important
match
just
coming
on
taking
the
chair
may
help
them
not
to
dispute
an
umpire
decision
when
they
are
in
court
themselves
they
will
realize
how
difficult
umpiring
is
and
that
bad
as
umpires
often
are
they
are
doing
their
best
to
dispute
a
decision
or
to
argue
with
the
umpire
never
helps
matters
it
usually
makes
him
nervous
a
bad
decision
must
be
taken
as
a
fortune
of
war
and
borne
in
a
sportsmanlike
manner
but
you
must
never
allow
the
crowd
to
influence
the
umpire
it
is
a
hopeless
expedient
for
many
people
who
watch
matches
are
ignorant
of
the
rules
of
the
game
sometimes
i
suppose
it
is
hobson
choice
an
umpire
is
chosen
from
the
gate
if
he
knows
little
or
nothing
of
his
duties
the
result
is
disastrous
should
there
be
difficulty
in
getting
an
umpire
who
knows
something
of
his
work
i
think
the
match
should
take
care
of
itself
i
have
experienced
umpires
who
do
not
even
know
how
to
score
and
now
a
word
or
two
about
it
is
very
difficult
to
manage
a
lawn
tennis
club
successfully
much
tact
is
required
i
think
it
is
almost
impossible
to
prevent
a
club
being
cliquey
and
i
should
always
advise
a
player
who
wishes
to
improve
her
game
to
join
one
which
is
more
concerned
with
its
tennis
than
its
social
side
some
clubs
still
use
the
game
for
a
where
long
trailing
skirts
sunshades
and
basket
chairs
predominate
perhaps
a
game
or
two
is
played
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
that
sort
of
club
should
be
avoided
if
you
are
a
keen
and
enthusiastic
player
the
committee
of
a
club
should
be
a
small
one
consisting
of
members
who
are
devoted
to
the
best
interests
of
the
game
their
aim
should
be
to
keep
in
touch
with
all
the
latest
developments
and
above
all
to
keep
up
to
date
advancing
with
the
times
a
committee
sometimes
embraces
old
supporters
of
the
club
who
have
been
members
for
years
and
years
they
have
ideas
are
very
conservative
and
do
not
like
innovations
of
any
sort
even
if
changes
are
obviously
necessary
for
the
benefit
of
the
game
a
committee
should
see
that
their
club
has
a
good
for
contests
are
excellent
practice
for
the
members
and
there
is
nothing
like
fostering
a
spirit
of
friendly
rivalry
care
should
be
taken
to
choose
players
who
make
a
good
pair
and
combine
well
together
a
committee
should
do
all
in
its
power
to
improve
the
standard
of
play
and
that
can
only
be
accomplished
by
having
courts
and
good
balls
many
clubs
are
not
equipped
with
for
the
single
game
that
is
a
great
mistake
because
a
player
will
practise
without
them
in
her
club
and
then
when
she
enters
for
a
tournament
will
have
to
use
them
it
is
bound
to
put
her
off
her
game
such
details
make
all
the
difference
between
good
and
bad
management
of
a
club

sisters

sent
to
by
miss

sutton
from
her
home
in
it
is
an
excellent
plan
for
members
of
the
committee
to
drop
in
at
some
of
the
tournaments
and
see
how
things
are
done
there
developments
may
have
occurred
of
which
they
know
nothing
and
they
could
pick
up
many
a
wrinkle
by
a
tour
of
inspection
before
one
secretary
of
a
fairly
large
tournament
went
to
wimbledon

had
never
seen

background
chapter
vi
some
personal
reminiscences
i
have
been
asked
to
write
what
i
can
remember
of
my
earliest
tennis
days
this
is
rather
difficult
as
it
is
now
thirteen
years
since
i
entered
for
my
first
tournament
in
it
is
never
easy
or
pleasant
to
write
one
own
biography
but
i
have
been
assured
that
readers
will
be
interested
to
hear
something
of
my
career
in
court
i
have
said
that
was
the
first
year
i
entered
for
a
tournament
which
is
quite
true
but
i
always
reckon
that
my
tournament
experience
did
not
really
start
until
the
year
because
in
the
two
previous
years
i
only
entered
for
one
tournament
the
gipsy
and
only
in
the
handicap
at
that
and
i
came
out
first
round
in
i
played
in
three
tournaments
and
in
more
events
at
each
one
my
earliest
recollections
of
a
racket
and
tennis
ball
go
back
to
when
i
was
quite
small
my
greatest
amusement
was
to
play
up
against
a
brick
wall
with
numerous
dolls
and
animals
of
all
kinds
as
spectators
really
as
big
a
gate
as
we
get
now
at
some
tournaments
each
toy
in
turn
was
chosen
as
my
opponent
needless
to
say
i
always
won
these
matches
my
adversaries
took
very
little
interest
in
the
proceedings
this
was
some
years
before
i
even
played
in
a
court
and
i
think
it
was
a
very
good
way
of
starting
the
game
i
then
played
in
a
court
we
had
at
home
which
was
not
very
good
gooseberry
bushes
prevented
our
running
outside
the
court
at
all
i
next
joined
a
club
at
ealing
common
and
at
the
age
of
eleven
won
my
first
prize
the
handicap
singles
at
our
club
tournament
of
course
i
was
receiving
enormous
points
and
i
remember
to
this
day
how
bored
the
best
lady
players
in
the
club
were
when
they
had
to
play
me
my
game
then
from
all
accounts
involved
a
sequence
of
very
high
lobs
i
am
now
quite
envious
of
the
accuracy
of
my
lobbing
in
those
days
i
had
absolutely
no
pace
but
was
active
and
very
steady
and
desperately
serious
and
keen
about
the
game
at
this
time
also
i
used
to
play
at
college
preferring
tennis
to
cricket
which
was
the
exception
cricket
was
the
great
game
tennis
was
pushed
into
the
background
and
very
little
interest
was
taken
in
it
even
when
the
matches
were
played
to
decide
the
winner
of
the
racket
presented
each
year
to
the
best
player
in
the
school
by
some
kind
parent
i
won
this
racket
one
year
but
could
never
use
it
as
it
was
heavily
weighted
with
an
enormous
silver
shield
on
which
was
a
lengthy
inscription
of
course
the
balance
of
the
racket
was
absolutely
upset
there
was
not
much
chance
of
improving
at
school
because
nobody
took
the
trouble
to
have
the
court
or
net
of
the
right
dimensions
the
rules
of
the
game
were
not
even
known
every
ball
that
touched
the
line
was
given
out
i
remember
a
very
heated
argument
i
had
with
a
mistress
who
was
umpiring
a
match
for
me
the
result
of
which
was
that
i
had
lines
to
write
for
impertinence
in
i
joined
the
ealing
lawn
tennis
club
and
won
the
singles
championship
cup
three
years
in
succession
thus
keeping
it
for
my
own
property
at
one
time
hillyard
and
sterry
had
both
been
members
of
this
same
club
curiously
enough
hillyard
sterry
miss
sutton
and
myself
have
all
lived
at
different
periods
of
our
lives
very
close
together
hillyard
at
greenford
sterry
and
myself
at
ealing
and
miss
sutton
at
acton
i
think
about
this
time
i
very
much
improved
my
game
by
constantly
playing
singles
against
the
best
men
in
the
club
and
also
doubles
with
three
men
this
was
undoubtedly
excellent
practice
for
me
illustration

from
my
album
in
i
won
my
first
prizes
in
open
tournaments
the
handicap
singles
at
chiswick
park
and
queen
club
at
chiswick
i
received
and
met
miss
cooper
in
the
i
remember
quite
well
my
stage
fright
when
i
went
into
court
against
this
famous
player
even
at
the
tremendous
odds
of
owe
and
give
i
lost
the
first
set
easily
and
the
game
was
then
postponed
until
the
next
day
owing
to
failing
light
after
that
first
set
a
friend
said
to
me
if
you
could
only
forget
it
miss
cooper
i
am
certain
you
could
win
the
next
day
i
tried
to
follow
out
this
advice
and
eventually
won
the
match
with
the
score
of
at
queen
i
met
miss
cooper
again
she
was
owing
and
i
was
receiving
i
again
managed
to
win
this
time
in
two
sets
at
eastbourne
the
same
year
my
third
tournament
i
was
in
the
handicap
owing
and
survived
a
few
rounds
miss

was
also
in
the
second
class

we
did
not
meet
miss
morton
miss
greene
miss
garfit
miss
robb
hillyard
miss

miss

i
defeated
in
at
chiswick
park
i
was
beaten
in
the
next
round
by
miss
tulloch
after
a
severe
tussle
i
again
won
the

was

in
miss
marion
jones
then
american
lady
champion
came
over
to
england
i
played
one
of
the
most
exhausting
matches
against
her
that
i
have
ever
experienced
it
was
at
queen
club
in
the
handicap
singles
i
was
owing
and
miss
jones
receiving
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
at
the
time
about
this
match
and
in
spite
of
the
tremendous
heat
we
do
not
get
such
summers
now
we
were
persuaded
to
go
into
court
in
truth
it
was
a
gruelling
day
i
remember
men
walked
about
the
streets
fanning
themselves
we
played
for
hours
in
a
blazing
sun
and
i
eventually
won
the
score
being
after
the
match
miss
jones
was
taken
to
the
in
a
fainting
condition
and
when
i
reached
home
i
had
an
attack
of
sunstroke
and
had
my
head
packed
in
ice
the
umpire
was
also
seriously
ill
for
some
time
it
was
only
the
international
element
in
the
game
and
the
controversy
about
the
relative
points
that
made
us
fight
it
out
to
the
bitter
end
we
both
thoroughly
agreed
with
the
notice
of
this
match
which
appeared
in
the
following
week
the
ladies
had
their
example
of
untiring
effort
and
splendid
patience
in
the
second
round
of
the
handicap
singles
when
miss
marion
jones
the
american
champion
receive
met
miss
douglass
owe
the
tie
was
played
off
under
exceptionally
trying
circumstances
a
fiercely
hot
sun
was
pouring
its
rays
on
the
court
and
there
was
scarcely
a
breath
of
air
yet
for
hours
without
hats
did
these
ladies
strive
for
mastery
the
first
set
fell
to
miss
jones
after
games
had
been
played
the
second
was
secured
by
miss
douglass
with
comparative
ease
neither
the
odds
nor
the
previous
exertions
appearing
to
affect
her
the
third
set
brought
out
a
remarkable
display
of
patience
determination
and
cool
judgment
for
when
it
stood
out
at
games
to
in
miss
jones
favour
miss
douglass
won
the
next
games
right
off
each
game
being
fought
out
with
great
resolution
it
may
be
doubted
whether
either
for
tennis
sake
or
such
a
contest
under
such
conditions
is
wise
i
was
not
surprised
to
hear
it
mentioned
that
not
only
had
both
competitors
severely
felt
the
strain
but
that
even
the
umpire
had
suffered
this
year
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
champion
of
miss
boothby
won
the
handicap
singles
at
beckenham
receiving
this
year
too
saw
my
first
appearance
at
wimbledon
i
was
not
in
the
lists
very
long
meeting
miss
martin
first
round
i
do
not
think
the
game
lasted
long
and
i
have
only
a
very
faint
recollection
of
it
but
i
remember
thinking
miss
martin
strokes
were
the
finest
i
had
ever
seen
at
eastbourne
a
couple
of
months
later
i
was
lucky
enough
to
meet
miss
cooper
on
a
very
off
day
and
run
her
close
in
the
open
singles
the
match
caused
quite
a
sensation
we
started
rather
late
in
the
tea
interval
and
nobody
took
the
least
interest
in
what
was
considered
a
forgone
conclusion
however
when
it
got
abroad
that
misss
cooper
had
actually
lost
the
first
set
people
came
hurrying
round
the
court
in
great
consternation
lest
miss
cooper
whom
they
all
knew
so
well
should
go
down
to
a
play
who
was
quite
unknown
i
had
been
in
the
second
class
only
the
year
before
miss
cooper
eventually
secured
the
match
i
met
sterry
on
many
subsequent
occasions
before
i
could
get
anything
like
so
close
to
her
i
really
used
to
get
quite
weary
of
being
beaten
by
her
when
the
handicap
singles
came
out
the
day
after
this
match
i
was
put
to
owe
in
the
first
class
which
pleased
me
immensely
miss
robb
greville
and
miss
cooper
were
owe
and
hillyard

was
in
the

the

beating
greville
in
the
challenge
round
at
beckenham
defeat
came
as
a
great
surprise
to
every
one
it
was
her
third
year
for
the
cup
and
this
may
have
accounted
for
her
being
much
below
her
usual
form
i
had
certainly
improved
a
great
deal
even
in
that
one
week
for
i
had
had
a
hard
match
every
day
meeting
miss
tulloch
miss
morton
and
countess
schulenberg
with
whom
i
had
a
tremendous
match
in
the
preceding
rounds
greville
on
the
other
hand
had
been
standing
out
the
custom
at
beckenham
one
that
i
personally
always
find
a
great

my
game
immensely
the
first
against

i
just
won
the
second
against
the
late
miss

i
just
lost
after
one
of
the
closest
matches
i
have
ever
played
miss
robb
won
the
championship
this
year
it
was
a
great
fight
and
though
of
course
it
is
hard
to
judge
i
always
feel
i
played
in
that
game
as
well
as
i
have
ever
played
the
score
in
miss
robb
favour
was
thus
we
both
won
seventeen
games
this
year
i
paid
my
first
visit
to
newcastle
a
tournament
which
i
always
look
forward
to
and
enjoy
as
much
as
any
meeting
the
management
is
all
one
can
desire
the
people
so
keen
and
hospitable
i
had
a
good
hard
fight
with
sterry
losing
and
winning
with
her
the
ladies
doubles
cups
at
brighton
i
was
again
beaten
by
sterry
although
managing
this
time
to
get
a
set
at
eastbourne
the
following
week
i
won
my
first
match
against
sterry
in
open

the
score
being
i
was
simply
delighted
after
so
many
reverses
to
win
a
match
against
this
player
i
had
been
beaten
so
often
by
her
and
sometimes
felt
as
though
i
never
should
be
rewarded
by
a

championship
with
riseley
and
was
beaten
in
the
challenge
round
of
the
ladies
singles
by
miss

after
a
very
hard
struggle
it
seemed
a
great
pity
that
miss
martin
was
not
able
to
play
at
wimbledon
that
year
it
was
a
lean
year
and
for
me
a
lucky
one
for
with
so
many
of
the
best
players
not
competing
for
the
championship
hillyard
sterry
miss
robb
and
miss
martin
were
all
absentees
i
was
given
a
chance
of
winning
the
coveted
title
i
met
miss
thomson
in
the
final
who
had
beaten
miss
morton
and
miss
wilson
in
the
preceding
rounds
i
had
had
a
good
fight
against
miss
lowther
before
reaching
the
final
although
i
was
expected
to
beat
miss
thomson
and
actually
did
win
the
match
i
scarcely
deserved
my
triumph
miss
thomson
played
by
far
the
better
tennis
and
it
was
really
very
hard
luck
on
her
that
she
did
not
succeed
at
one
time
she
was
a
set
up
and
four
games
to
one
and
i
was
forced
to
play
on
the
defensive
nearly
the
whole
time
miss
thomson
played
beautifully
placing
with
great
accuracy
down
the
lines
and
across
the
court
indeed
her
placing
was
so
good
that
i
always
seemed
to
be
yards
away
from
her
return
when
i
had
thought
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
get
to
the
ball
it
has
always
been
a
marvel
to
me
how
i
won
that
match
but
i
think
it
was
chiefly
condition

thomson

just
at

occurred
it
was
very
disappointing
to
default
after
coming
so
far
to
take
part
in
these
tournaments

months
elapsed
before
i
could
use
my

come

strange

practically
friendless

made
many
friends
over
here
but
she
came
over
alone
and
to
play
and
defeat
one
after
another
of
the
best
players
in
this
country
was
a
feat
which
filled
us
all
with
unbounded
admiration

certainly
the
most
exciting
match
i
have
ever
played
and
the
one
that
gave
me
the
most
pleasure
to
win
was
my
match
at
wimbledon
against
miss
sutton
in
the
match
itself
was
not
exactly
enjoyable
the
strain
was
too
great
so
much
seemed
to
depend
upon
me
both
for
my
own
reputation
and
that
of
my
country
when
palmer
secretary
of
the
all
england
club
escorted
us
into
the
centre
court
and
left
us
with
a
word
of
encouragement
in
my
ear
i
felt
helpless
and
destitute
you
can
not
realize
what
it
means
to
face
four
thousand
people
and
know
that
so
much
depends
on
your
own
exertions
and
coolness
miss
sutton
i
think
must
have
felt
this
loneliness
in
a
still
greater
degree
for
she
was
away
from
her
country
her
own
people
and
friends
i
have
never
had
such
a
craving
to
speak
to
some
one
as
i
had
in
this
match
just
one
friendly
word
to
tell
me
whether
i
was
playing
the
right
sort
of
game
or
not
i
confess
my
feelings
were
very
strung
up
i
remember
in
the
second
set
when
miss
sutton
led
at
three
games
to
love
i
said
to
the
umpire
as
we
crossed
over
i
wonder
have
i
gone
off
or
is
she
playing
much
better
but
of
course
his
face
was
like
a
mask
he
did
vouchsafe
a
word
not
that
i
expected
him
to
speak
but
i
felt
i
simply
must
say
something
to
some
one
he
told
me
afterwards
he
wanted
to
say
i
do
know
but
stick
to
it
whatever
happens
concentration
on
the
game
in
this
match
was
terribly
difficult
as
the
crowd
was
so
huge
and
seemed
so
excited
it
was
almost
impossible
to
forget
the
people
and
lose
yourself
in
the
game
i
can
quite
well
remember
a
dispute
going
on
in
the
open
stand
for
quite
a
long
time
during
the
first
set
i
think
a
lady
would
not
put
down
her
sunshade
there
was
quite
a
commotion
about
it
and
then
people
near
would
shout
advice
to
me
or
scream
out
it
over
run
this
happened
two
or
three
times
and
although
i
knew
they
were
trying
to
help
me
which
in
itself
was
cheering
and
encouraging
it
was
very
distracting
and
disconcerting
but
after
some
time
i
lost
it
all
and
became
engrossed
in
the
game
i
think
in
miss
sutton
was
much
steadier
and
played
a
better
game
but
i
do
not
think
she
had
quite
the
same
terrific
drive
as
in
the
first
two
years
she
was
over
here
her
strokes
were
safer
perhaps
but
not
so
formidable
and
powerful

one
of
the
great
charms
of
playing
in
various
tournaments
is
the
means
it
affords
of
visiting
all
the
different
towns
and
countries
it
may
involve
considerable
travelling
and
expense
but
the
touring
abroad
is
both
an
education
and
a
delight
monte

nice

all
bring
the
pleasantest
reminiscences
many
of
us
have
travelled
about
together
which
is
the
jolliest
way
of
doing
the
tournaments
i
remember
one
most
enjoyable
trip
when
miss
lowther
motored
the
hillyards
and
myself
through
germany
an
ideal
way
of
doing
tournaments
the
place
at
which
a
meeting
is
held
its
surroundings
also
the
facilities
it
offers
for
amusement
in
the
evening
after
your
day
tennis
is
over
add
to
the
enjoyment
and
make
a
material
difference
it
will
always
be
one
of
my
chief
delights
in
thinking
of
my
tennis
career
to
remember
the
hospitality
and
many
courtesies
i
have
everywhere
received
and
the
many
friends
i
have
made
who
i
trust
will
remain
friends
long
after
my
tennis
is
a
thing
of
the
past
it
is
extraordinary
how
naïve
the
general
public
sometimes
are
people
will
watch
tennis
sitting
for
hours
together
perhaps
in
great
discomfort
and
yet
display
a
lamentable
want
of
knowledge
about
the
game
in
fact
to
many
its
object
is
a
mystery
this
seems
hardly
possible
but
it
is
quite
true
i
once
overheard
a
lady
who
was
watching
a
match
in
the
centre
court
at
wimbledon
remark
there
the
very
first
time
that
man
has
hit
the
net
with
the
ball
and
he
has
had
hundreds
of
tries
i
thought
the
man
mentioned
must
be
playing
pretty
good
tennis
one
really
wonders
why
these
onlookers
spend
so
much
time
round
a
court
or
where
the
pleasure
can
come
in
for
them
at
a
garden
party
not
so
very
long
ago
where
tennis
was
on
the
programme
the
visitors
arriving
on
the
court
found
one
solitary
ball
tied
round
with
a
long
piece
of
string
the
other
end
being
attached
to
the
net
to
a
natural
inquiry
the
hostess
replied
oh
they
lost
so
many
balls
in
the
shrubbery
last
year
i
really
could
afford
it
and
thought
of
this
plan
it
has
been
most
successful
this
ball
has
lasted
for
ages
another
lady
at
eastbourne
whom
i
had
noticed
because
she
never
left
her
seat
bringing
her
lunch
with
her
so
as
not
to
lose
a
moment
play
asked
me
at
the
end
of
the
week
while
watching
a
double
whether
the
partners
were
side
by
side
or
opposite
as
in
bridge
one
of
the
most
rooted
mistakes
in
the
public
mind
is
that
the
player
is
a
professional
many
times
people
have
said
to
me
you
must
be
making
quite
a
nice
bit
of
from
your
tennis
making
i
say
spending
you
mean
which
always
makes
them
stare
in
amazement
this
fallacy
annoys
me
very
much
and
is
i
find
very
common
let
me
take
the
opportunity
here
of
pointing
out
that
there
are
no
professional
lawn
tennis
players
excepting
a
few
coaches
at
club
london
and
at
some
of
the
clubs
abroad
these
men
of
course
can
not
compete
in
open
tournaments
chapter
vii
my
most
memorable
match
by
leading
players
following
contributions
in
response
to
a
request
for
some
account
of
their
most
noteworthy
encounter
on
court
have
been
kindly
furnished
for
this
volume
by
leading
lady
hillyard
one
of
the
most
exciting
matches
i
remember
was
the
final
for
the
championship
at
wimbledon
played
on
the
centre
court
on
july
between
miss
rice
and
me
i
started
very
nervously
as
miss
rice
had
given
me
rather
a
fright
in
the
irish
championship
the
month
before
when
she
appeared
in
dublin
as
a
dark
horse
on
that
occasion
i
had
only
scraped
through
i
began
the
match
at
wimbledon
by
serving
a
double
fault
and
lost
several
games
by
doing
the
same
thing
in
the
first
set
my
length
was
awful
and
miss
rice
was
playing
well
from
the
start
she
had
a
very
fine
drive
but
like
myself
a
bad
she
led
at
games
to
and
took
the
first
set
at
in
the
second
set
i
regained
my
confidence
a
little
winning
three
love
games
out
of
the
first
four
but
miss
rice
won
the
next
four
games
in
succession
the
score
being
called
and
against
me
at
this
point
in
my
despair
i
said
to
chipp
who
was
umpiring
the
match
what
i
do
his
grim
answer
was
play
better
i
should
think
i
then
fully
realized
that
i
had

been
playing
my
best
game
and
that
to
win
i
must
hit
harder
this
i
did
with
the
result
that
my
length
improved
and
i
snatched
this
game
from
the
fire
although
miss
rice
was
three
times
within
a
stroke
of
the
match
and
i
eventually
won

set

the
last
set

fought

i
began
well
and
led
at
miss

won
the
next
three
games
in
succession
and
reached
in
the
following
game
this
was
her
last
effort
as
i
ran
out
at
winning
the
championship
for
the
second
time
i
think
it
was
one
of
the
closest
matches
i
ever
played
and
i
see
by
that
i
only
won
games
to
her
and
strokes
to
her
and
i
felt
i
was
most
lucky
to
win
at
all
signature

hillyard
sterry
of
course
it
goes
without
saying
that
my
most
memorable
and
exciting
matches
will
all
be
those
in
which
i
have
excelled
or
been
the
most
distinguished
person
at
the
immediate
moment
let
me
just
say
that
i
am
not
going
to
give
details
of
any
match
as
that
is
beyond
my
power
and
i
assume
of
little
interest
to
the
reader
winning
my
first
championship
of
the
ealing
lawn
tennis
club
at
the
age
of
was
a
very
important
moment
in
my
life
how
well
i
remember
bedecked
by
my
proud
mother
in
my
best
clothes
running
off
to
the
club
on
the
saturday
afternoon
to
play
in
the
final
without
a
vestige
of
nerve
would
that
i
had
none
now
and
winning
that
was
the
first
really
important
match
of
my
life
another
great
game
will
always
be
imprinted
on
my
memory
and
that
was
in
the
first
year
that
the
late
mahony
and
i
won
the
all
england
mixed
championship
we
beat
hillyard
and
baddeley
in
the
final
the
excitement
of
the
onlookers
was
intense
and
never
shall
i
forget
the
overpowering
sensation
i
felt
as
we
walked
after
our
win

packed
to

another

the

certainly
i
must
be
honest
and
say
it
was
exactly
a
good
championship
win
for
miss
dodd
hillyard
and
miss
martin
were
all
standing
out
any
of
these
could
have
beaten
me
nevertheless
it
was
a
delightful
feeling
to
win
the
blue
ribbon
of
england
especially
as
my
opponent
in
the
final
miss
jackson
had
led
in
both
sets
by
some
good
fortune
i
was
able
to
win
seven
games
off
the
reel
in
each
case
one
more
match
in
i
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
miss
may
sutton
who
made
her
first
appearance
in
england
in
beating
everybody
without
the
loss
of
a
set
i
had
also
heard
she
was
a
giant
of
strength
and
that
the
harder
one
hit
the
more
she
liked
it
the
first
time
i
met
her
was
at
liverpool
in
i
did
not
play
the
previous
season
i
was
determined
to
introduce
unfamiliar
tactics
giving
her
short
balls
in
order
to
entice
her
up
to
the
net
the
result
was
that
many
of
her
terrific
drives
went
out
and
i
think
this
was
primarily
the
reason
why
i
was
the
first
lady
in
england
to
take
a
set
from
her
i
recollect
her
telling
me
after
the
match
was
over
that
my
game
was
very
different
to
any
other
she
had
ever
played
and
that
she
was
not
anxious
to
meet
me
again
remarks
i
took
as
a
great
compliment
there
are
scores
of
games
just
the
reverse
of
pleasant
which
are
imprinted
on
my
memory
but
i
am
not
going
to
revive
them
at
my
own
expense
hoping
they
have
been
forgotten
and
forgiven
to
my
account
by
any
unfortunate
partners

a
match
that
remains
in
my
memory
perhaps
more
than
any
other
was
the
final
of
the
irish
championship
singles
at
dublin
in
when
miss
martin
and
i
met
and
had
a
long
struggle
for
supremacy
at
one
time
it
really
seemed
as
if
i
must
win
this
match
as
i
led
at
games
to
and
was
within
a
stroke
of
the
match
but
i
could
not
make
that
one
point
once
when
i
had
the
advantage
and
only
wanted
an
ace
to
win
the
match
one
of
my
returns
ran
along
the
top
of
the
net
and
then
unfortunately
for
me
dropped
my
side
miss
martin
stuck
to
her
guns
persistently
and
eventually
pulled
the
match
out
of
the
fire
winning
the
next
six
games
straight
off
and
thus
becoming
irish
champion
for
it
was
very
disappointing
to
lose
after
being
so
near
victory
the
score
in
mis
martin
favour
was

in
recalling
the
most
remarkable
lawn
tennis
match
that
i
have
ever
played
i
do
not
think
i
can
do
better
than
give
the
open
mixed
double
that
took
place
on
the
final
day
of
the
kent
championship
meeting
at
beckenham
on
june
roper
barrett
and
i
met
prebble
and
miss

and
the
story
of
the
match
is
one
of
startling
lapses
and
recoveries
in
the
first
set
prebble
and
miss
boothby
profited
by
the
combination
born
of
frequent
association
in
mixed
doubles
miss
boothby
was
very
good
from
the
back
of
the
court
and
prebble
seemed
to
make
mincemeat
of
my
returns
it
was
their
set
by
in
the
second
set
roper
barrett
was
quite
wonderful
and
killed
every
ball
that
he
could
possibly
reach
the
result
was
that
the
set
was
easily
ours
by
our
opponents
however
had
something
in
reserve
and
i
playing
badly
they
ran
away
to
in
the
third
set
all
seemed
over
my
partner
and
i
made
a
great
effort
and
got
one
game
and
we
congratulated
ourselves
on
saving
a
love
set
then
the
excitement
began
and
we
added
game
after
game
to
our
side
i
am
sure
the
crowd
beame
intensely
interested
and
quite
worked
themselves
up
as
we
drew
to
all
barrett
at
this
time
was
simply
invincible
and
i
managed
somehow
to
keep
the
balls
out
of
prebble
reach
and
play
everything
to
miss
boothby
upon
whom
devolved
the
responsibility
my
partner
volleyed
at
all
kinds
of
remarkable
angles
and
as
in
describing
the
match
remarked
sat
on
the
net
and
was
in
complete
command
we
took
seven
games
consecutively
and
won

with
it

without

my
most
exciting
match
was
the
final
last
year
at

in
every
player
heart
there
must
be
a
faint
hope
that
one
day
she
may
win
the
all
england
championship
at
least
it
has
always
been
in
mine
from
christmas
and
all
through
the
spring
my
family
and
friends
had
dinned
into
my
ears
that
now
was
my
chance
and
if
i
did
not
win
this
year
i
never
would
only
when
i
was
leading
one
set
up
and
in
the
second
did
all
these
things
flash
across
my
mind
i
suddenly
got
nervous
oh
the
misery
of
it
i
served
double
fault
after
double
fault
i
learnt
afterwards
that
i
gave
away
sixteen
points
in
this
way
and
my
friends
told
me
that
it
was
a
relief
to
them
when
my
service
went
over

slowly
my
opponent

up
won

i
had
been
fighting
hard
to
regain
confidence
at
last

nerve
came
back
i
was
determined
to
win
and
only
after
a
very
great
effort
just
succeeded
in
capturing
the
championship
with
the
narrow
margin
of
in
the
final
set
it
was
not
until
i
had
finished
and
had
come
off
the
court
that
i
realized
how
very
excited
i
had
been
and
how
relieved
i
was
when
it
was
all
over
only
those
who
have
had
experience
can
know
how
exhausting
it
is
to
concentrate
one
whole
thoughts
and
efforts
without
cessation
for
an
hour
or
more
fortunately
you
do
not
feel
the
strain
until
afterwards
when
it
does
not

and
then

can
look

very
great
pleasure
and
satisfaction

my

match
was
in
the

championship
at
liverpool
in

and
i
were
playing
miss

and
we
had

victory
i
do
not

the

at
one

played

desperate
stroke
as

was
not
guarding
his

none

of
note
than

the
match
which
i
think
i
shall
remember
long
after
many
others
are
forgotten
took
place
last
year
in
the
comparatively
small
and
tournament
at
romsey
for
the
first
time
for
some
years
i
had
missed
winter
practice
on
the
covered
courts
at
queen
club
and
in
the
south
of
france
and
when
i
started
again
late
in
june
on
moderate
club
courts
and
against
none
too
keen
opponents
i
found
myself
looking
forward
with
apprehension
to
my
first
effort
in
public
in
the
of
the
ladies
open
singles
at
romsey
i
met
miss
sugden
whose
reputation
as
a
lawn
tennis
player
is
more
or
less
a
local
one
chiefly
for
the
reason
that
she
has
not
competed
in
any
of
the
tournaments
it
was
a
close
afternoon
and
the
court
being
heavy
we
both
felt
the
heat
very
much
as
the
game
progressed
i
never
really
looked
like
winning
the
first
set
my
opponent
led
and
though
i
managed
to
equalize
she
easily
ran
out
at
it
was
in
the
second
set
that
the
real
struggle
took
place
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
miss

won
game
after
game
until
the
game
stood
at
against
me
and
all

by
good
luck
i
snatched
that
game
and
the
two
following
at
and
my
service
we
had

quite
ten
or
twelve
times
but
in
the

i
managed

felt
better

renewed
confidence
and
steadier
nerves
i
won

think
there
was
nothing
particularly
remarkable
in
the
match
but
somehow
i
felt
that
confidence
in
myself
for
the
future
depended
in
a
great
measure
on
my
success
in
this
event
and
in

of
having

owe
an
apology
to

for
writing
about
a
match
in
which
i
happened
to
beat
her
as
she
is
and
was
then
a
player
altogether
a
class
above
me
no
doubt
it
became
memorable
as
i
certainly
never
expected
to
win
at
the
outset
and
still
less
so

i
was

of

in

everything
went
well
for

i
actually
got
to
and

was

her
service
then
i
lost
two
points
quite
easily
those
winning
shots
are
so
hard
to
make
and
at
deuce
we
had
a
tremendous
rally
which
ended
in
a
good
shot
by
my
opponent
that
i
could
get
to
and
did
even
try
the
linesman
called
out
which
i
contradicted
and
general
confusion
took
place

in
the

and
it
all
arose

of
the

rally
when
a
train
was
passing
and
we
neither
of
us
heard
it
i
never
knew
the
explanation
till
after
the
match
and
was
quite
convinced
i
had
sneaked
the
point
and
somehow
i
went
all
to
pieces
and
everything
went
as
badly
as
it
had
gone
well
before
till
miss

crept
up
to
then
i
made
an
expiring
effort
just
in
time
i
dare
say
she
was
tired
for
i
won
that
game
fairly
easily
we
had
a
great
fight
for
the
thirteenth
which
i
fortunately
won
and
finished
the
match
with
a
love

no
one
was
more
surprised
than

each
in

seems
at
the
time
to
be

one
which

at

time
was
