who
has
not
read
pilgrim
progress
who
has
not
in
childhood
followed
the
wandering
christian
on
his
way
to
the
celestial
city
who
has
not
laid
at
night
his
young
head
on
the
pillow
to
paint
on
the
walls
of
darkness
pictures
of
the
wicket
gate
and
the
archers

hill

the
lions
and

doubting

and
vanity
fair
the
sunny
delectable
mountains
and
the
shepherds
the
black
river
and
the
wonderful
glory
beyond
it
and
at
last
fallen
asleep
to
dream
over
the
strange
story
to
hear
the
sweet
welcomings
of
the
sisters
at
the
house
beautiful
and
the
song
of
birds
from
the
window
of
that
upper
chamber
which
opened
towards
the
sunrising
and
who
looking
back
to
the
green
spots
in
his
childish
experiences
does
not
bless
the
good
tinker
of
elstow
and
who
that
has
reperused
the
story
of
the
pilgrim
at
a
maturer
age
and
felt
the
plummet
of
its
truth
sounding
in
the
deep
places
of
the
soul
has
not
reason
to
bless
the
author
for
some
timely
warning
or
grateful
encouragement
where
is
the
scholar
the
poet
the
man
of
taste
and
feeling
who
does
not
with
cowper
even
in
transitory
life
late
day
revere
the
man
whose
pilgrim
marks
the
road
and
guides
the
progress
of
the
soul
to
god
we
have
just
been
reading
with
no
slight
degree
of
interest
that
simple
but
wonderful
piece
of
autobiography
entitled
grace
abounding
to
the
chief
of
sinners
from
the
pen
of
the
author
of
pilgrim
progress
it
is
the
record
of
a
journey
more
terrible
than
that
of
the
ideal
pilgrim
truth
stranger
than
fiction
the
painful
upward
struggling
of
a
spirit
from
the
blackness
of
despair
and
blasphemy
into
the
high
pure
air
of
hope
and
faith
more
earnest
words
were
never
written
it
is
the
entire
unveiling
of
a
human
heart
the
tearing
off
of
the
covering
of
its
sin
the
voice
which
speaks
to
us
from
these
old
pages
seems
not
so
much
that
of
a
denizen
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
as
of
a
soul
at
the
last
solemn
confessional
shorn
of
all
ornament
simple
and
direct
as
the
contrition
and
prayer
of
childhood
when
for
the
first
time
the
spectre
of
sin
stands
by
its
bedside
the
style
is
that
of
a
man
dead
to
careless
of
the
world
opinion
and
only
desirous
to
convey
to
others
in
all
truthfulness
and
sincerity
the
lesson
of
his
inward
trials
temptations
sins
weaknesses
and
dangers
and
to
give
glory
to
him
who
had
mercifully
led
him
through
all
and
enabled
him
like
his
own
pilgrim
to
leave
behind
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
the
snares
of
the
enchanted
ground
and
the
terrors
of
doubting
castle
and
to
reach
the
land
of
beulah
where
the
air
was
sweet
and
pleasant
and
the
birds
sang
and
the
flowers
sprang
up
around
him
and
the
shining
ones
walked
in
the
brightness
of
the
not
distant
heaven
in
the
introductory
pages
he
says
he
could
have
dipped
into
a
style
higher
than
this
in
which
i
have
discoursed
and
could
have
adorned
all
things
more
than
here
i
have
seemed
to
do
but
i
dared
not
god
did
not
play
in
tempting
me
neither
did
i
play
when
i
sunk
as
it
were
into
a
bottomless
pit
when
the
pangs
of
hell
took
hold
on
me
wherefore
i
may
not
play
in
relating
of
them
but
be
plain
and
simple
and
lay
down
the
thing
as
it
was
this
book
as
well
as
pilgrim
progress
was
written
in
bedford
prison
and
was
designed
especially
for
the
comfort
and
edification
of
his
children
whom
god
had
counted
him
worthy
to
beget
in
faith
by
his
ministry
in
his
introduction
he
tells
them
that
although
taken
from
them
and
tied
up
sticking
as
it
were
between
the
teeth
of
the
lions
of
the
wilderness
he
once
again
as
before
from
the
top
of
shemer
and
hermon
so
now
from
the
lion
den
and
the
mountain
of
leopards
would
look
after
then
with
fatherly
care
and
desires
for
their
everlasting
welfare
if
said
he
you
have
sinned
against
light
if
you
are
tempted
to
blaspheme
if
you
are
drowned
in
despair
if
you
think
god
fights
against
you
or
if
heaven
is
hidden
from
your
eyes
remember
it
was
so
with
your
father
but
out
of
all
the
lord
delivered
me
he
gives
no
dates
he
affords
scarcely
a
clue
to
his
localities
of
the
man
as
he
worked
and
ate
and
drank
and
lodged
of
his
neighbors
and
contemporaries
of
all
he
saw
and
heard
of
the
world
about
him
we
have
only
an
occasional
glimpse
here
and
there
in
his
narrative
it
is
the
story
of
his
inward
life
only
that
he
relates
what
had
time
and
place
to
do
with
one
who
trembled
always
with
the
awful
consciousness
of
an
immortal
nature
and
about
whom
fell
alternately
the
shadows
of
hell
and
the
splendors
of
heaven
we
gather
indeed
from
his
record
that
he
was
not
an
idle
in
the
time
of
england
great
struggle
for
freedom
but
a
soldier
of
the
parliament
in
his
young
years
among
the
praying
sworders
and
pikemen
the
greathearts
and
holdfasts
whom
he
has
immortalized
in
his
allegory
but
the
only
allusion
which
he
makes
to
this
portion
of
his
experience
is
by
way
of
illustration
of
the
goodness
of
god
in
preserving
him
on
occasions
of
peril
he
was
born
at
elstow
in
bedfordshire
in
and
to
use
his
own
words
his
father
house
was
of
that
rank
which
is
the
meanest
and
most
despised
of
all
the
families
of
the
land
his
father
was
a
tinker
and
the
son
followed
the
same
calling
which
necessarily
brought
him
into
association
with
the
lowest
and
most
depraved
classes
of
english
society
the
estimation
in
which
the
tinker
and
his
occupation
were
held
in
the
seventeenth
century
may
be
learned
from
the
quaint
and
humorous
description
of
sir
thomas
overbury
the
tinker
saith
he
is
a
movable
for
he
hath
no
abiding
in
one
place
he
seems
to
be
devout
for
his
life
is
a
continual
pilgrimage
and
sometimes
in
humility
goes
barefoot
therein
making
necessity
a
virtue
he
is
a
gallant
for
he
carries
all
his
wealth
upon
his
back
or
a
philosopher
for
he
bears
all
his
substance
with
him
he
is
always
furnished
with
a
song
to
which
his
hammer
keeping
tune
proves
that
he
was
the
first
founder
of
the
drum
where
the
best
ale
is
there
stands
his
music
most
upon
crotchets
the
companion
of
his
travel
is
some
foul
quean
that
since
the
terrible
statute
has
recanted
gypsyism
and
is
turned
pedlaress
so
marches
he
all
over
england
with
his
bag
and
baggage
his
conversation
is
irreprovable
for
he
is
always
mending
he
observes
truly
the
statutes
and
therefore
had
rather
steal
than
beg
he
is
so
strong
an
enemy
of
idleness
that
in
mending
one
hole
he
would
rather
make
three
than
want
work
and
when
he
hath
done
he
throws
the
wallet
of
his
faults
behind
him
his
tongue
is
very
voluble
which
with
canting
proves
him
a
linguist
he
is
entertained
in
every
place
yet
enters
no
farther
than
the
door
to
avoid
suspicion
to
conclude
if
he
escape
tyburn
and
banbury
he
dies
a
beggar
truly
but
a
poor
beginning
for
a
pious
life
was
the
youth
of
john
bunyan
as
might
have
been
expected
he
was
a
wild
reckless
swearing
boy
as
his
father
doubtless
was
before
him
it
was
my
delight
says
he
to
be
taken
captive
by
the
devil
i
had
few
equals
both
for
cursing
and
swearing
lying
and
blaspheming
yet
in
his
ignorance
and
darkness
his
powerful
imagination
early
lent
terror
to
the
reproaches
of
conscience
he
was
scared
even
in
childhood
with
dreams
of
hell
and
apparitions
of
devils
troubled
with
fears
of
eternal
fire
and
the
malignant
demons
who
fed
it
in
the
regions
of
despair
he
says
that
he
often
wished
either
that
there
was
no
hell
or
that
he
had
been
born
a
devil
himself
that
he
might
be
a
tormentor
rather
than
one
of
the
tormented
at
an
early
age
he
appears
to
have
married
his
wife
was
as
poor
as
himself
for
he
tells
us
that
they
had
not
so
much
as
a
dish
or
spoon
between
them
but
she
brought
with
her
two
books
on
religious
subjects
the
reading
of
which
seems
to
have
had
no
slight
degree
of
influence
on
his
mind
he
went
to
church
regularly
adored
the
priest
and
all
things
pertaining
to
his
office
being
as
he
says
overrun
with
superstition
on
one
occasion
a
sermon
was
preached
against
the
breach
of
the
sabbath
by
sports
or
labor
which
struck
him
at
the
moment
as
especially
designed
for
himself
but
by
the
time
he
had
finished
his
dinner
he
was
prepared
to
shake
it
out
of
his
mind
and
return
to
his
sports
and
gaming
but
the
same
day
he
continues
as
i
was
in
the
midst
of
a
game
of
cat
and
having
struck
it
one
blow
from
the
hole
just
as
i
was
about
to
strike
it
a
second
time
a
voice
did
suddenly
dart
from
heaven
into
my
soul
which
said
thou
leave
thy
sins
and
go
to
heaven
or
have
thy
sins
and
go
to
hell
at
this
i
was
put
to
an
exceeding
maze
wherefore
leaving
my
cat
upon
the
ground
i
looked
up
to
heaven
and
it
was
as
if
i
had
with
the
eyes
of
my
understanding
seen
the
lord
jesus
look
down
upon
me
as
being
very
hotly
displeased
with
me
and
as
if
he
did
severely
threaten
me
with
some
grievous
punishment
for
those
and
other
ungodly
practices
i
had
no
sooner
thus
conceived
in
my
mind
but
suddenly
this
conclusion
fastened
on
my
spirit
for
the
former
hint
did
set
my
sins
again
before
my
face
that
i
had
been
a
great
and
grievous
sinner
and
that
it
was
now
too
late
for
me
to
look
after
heaven
for
christ
would
not
forgive
me
nor
pardon
my
transgressions
then
while
i
was
thinking
of
it
and
fearing
lest
it
should
be
so
i
felt
my
heart
sink
in
despair
concluding
it
was
too
late
and
therefore
i
resolved
in
my
mind
to
go
on
in
sin
for
thought
i
if
the
case
be
thus
my
state
is
surely
miserable
miserable
if
i
leave
my
sins
and
but
miserable
if
i
follow
them
i
can
but
be
damned
and
if
i
must
be
so
i
had
as
good
be
damned
for
many
sins
as
be
damned
for
few
the
reader
of
pilgrim
progress
can
not
fail
here
to
call
to
mind
the
wicked
suggestions
of
the
giant
to
christian
in
the
dungeon
of
doubting
castle
i
returned
he
says
desperately
to
my
sport
again
and
i
well
remember
that
presently
this
kind
of
despair
did
so
possess
my
soul
that
i
was
persuaded
i
could
never
attain
to
other
comfort
than
what
i
should
get
in
sin
for
heaven
was
gone
already
so
that
on
that
i
must
not
think
wherefore
i
found
within
me
great
desire
to
take
my
fill
of
sin
that
i
might
taste
the
sweetness
of
it
and
i
made
as
much
haste
as
i
could
to
fill
my
belly
with
its
delicates
lest
i
should
die
before
i
had
my
desires
for
that
i
feared
greatly
in
these
things
i
protest
before
god
i
lie
not
neither
do
i
frame
this
sort
of
speech
these
were
really
strongly
and
with
all
my
heart
my
desires
the
good
lord
whose
mercy
is
unsearchable
forgive
my
transgressions
one
day
while
standing
in
the
street
cursing
and
blaspheming
he
met
with
a
reproof
which
startled
him
the
woman
of
the
house
in
front
of
which
the
wicked
young
tinker
was
standing
herself
as
he
remarks
a
very
loose
ungodly
wretch
protested
that
his
horrible
profanity
made
her
tremble
that
he
was
the
ungodliest
fellow
for
swearing
she
had
ever
heard
and
able
to
spoil
all
the
youth
of
the
town
who
came
in
his
company
struck
by
this
wholly
unexpected
rebuke
he
at
once
abandoned
the
practice
of
swearing
although
previously
he
tells
us
that
he
had
never
known
how
to
speak
unless
he
put
an
oath
before
and
another
behind
the
good
name
which
he
gained
by
this
change
was
now
a
temptation
to
him
my
neighbors
he
says
were
amazed
at
my
great
conversion
from
prodigious
profaneness
to
something
like
a
moral
life
and
sober
man
now
therefore
they
began
to
praise
to
commend
and
to
speak
well
of
me
both
to
my
face
and
behind
my
back
now
i
was
as
they
said
become
godly
now
i
was
become
a
right
honest
man
but
oh
when
i
understood
those
were
their
words
and
opinions
of
me
it
pleased
me
mighty
well
for
though
as
yet
i
was
nothing
but
a
poor
painted
hypocrite
yet
i
loved
to
be
talked
of
as
one
that
was
truly
godly
i
was
proud
of
my
godliness
and
indeed
i
did
all
i
did
either
to
be
seen
of
or
well
spoken
of
by
men
and
thus
i
continued
for
about
a
twelvemonth
or
more
the
tyranny
of
his
imagination
at
this
period
is
seen
in
the
following
relation
of
his
abandonment
of
one
of
his
favorite
sports
now
you
must
know
that
before
this
i
had
taken
much
delight
in
ringing
but
my
conscience
beginning
to
be
tender
i
thought
such
practice
was
but
vain
and
therefore
forced
myself
to
leave
it
yet
my
mind
hankered
wherefore
i
would
go
to
the
and
look
on
though
i
durst
not
ring
but
i
thought
this
did
not
become
religion
neither
yet
i
forced
myself
and
would
look
on
still
but
quickly
after
i
began
to
think
if
one
of
the
bells
should
fall
then
i
chose
to
stand
under
a
main
beam
that
lay
overthwart
the
steeple
from
side
to
side
thinking
here
i
might
stand
sure
but
then
i
thought
again
should
the
bell
fall
with
a
swing
it
might
first
hit
the
wall
and
then
rebounding
upon
me
might
kill
me
for
all
this
beam
this
made
me
stand
in
the
steeple
door
and
now
thought
i
i
am
safe
enough
for
if
a
bell
should
then
fall
i
can
slip
out
behind
these
thick
walls
and
so
be
preserved
notwithstanding
so
after
this
i
would
yet
go
to
see
them
ring
but
would
not
go
any
farther
than
the
but
then
it
came
in
my
head
if
the
steeple
itself
should
fall
and
this
thought
it
may
for
aught
i
know
when
i
stood
and
looked
on
did
continually
so
shake
my
mind
that
i
durst
not
stand
at
the
any
longer
but
was
forced
to
flee
for
fear
the
steeple
should
fall
upon
my
head
about
this
time
while
wandering
through
bedford
in
pursuit
of
employment
he
chanced
to
see
three
or
four
poor
old
women
sitting
at
a
door
in
the
evening
sun
and
drawing
near
them
heard
them
converse
upon
the
things
of
god
of
his
work
in
their
hearts
of
their
natural
depravity
of
the
temptations
of
the
adversary
and
of
the
joy
of
believing
and
of
the
peace
of
reconciliation
the
words
of
the
aged
women
found
a
response
in
the
soul
of
the
listener
he
felt
his
heart
shake
to
use
his
own
words
he
saw
that
he
lacked
the
true
tokens
of
a
christian
he
now
forsook
the
company
of
the
profane
and
licentious
and
sought
that
of
a
poor
man
who
had
the
reputation
of
piety
but
to
his
grief
he
found
him
a
devilish
ranter
given
up
to
all
manner
of
uncleanness
he
would
laugh
at
all
exhortations
to
sobriety
and
deny
that
there
was
a
god
an
angel
or
a
spirit
neither
he
continues
was
this
man
only
a
temptation
to
me
but
my
calling
lying
in
the
country
i
happened
to
come
into
several
company
who
though
strict
in
religion
formerly
yet
were
also
drawn
away
by
these
ranters
these
would
also
talk
with
me
of
their
ways
and
condemn
me
as
illegal
and
dark
pretending
that
they
only
had
attained
to
perfection
that
they
could
do
what
they
would
and
not
sin
oh
these
temptations
were
suitable
to
my
flesh
i
being
but
a
young
man
and
my
nature
in
its
prime
but
god
who
had
as
i
hope
designed
me
for
better
things
kept
me
in
the
fear
of
his
name
and
did
not
suffer
me
to
accept
such
cursed
principles
at
this
time
he
was
sadly
troubled
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
he
had
that
faith
which
the
scriptures
spake
of
travelling
one
day
from
elstow
to
bedford
after
a
recent
rain
which
had
left
pools
of
water
in
the
path
he
felt
a
strong
desire
to
settle
the
question
by
commanding
the
pools
to
become
dry
and
the
dry
places
to
become
pools
going
under
the
hedge
to
pray
for
ability
to
work
the
miracle
he
was
struck
with
the
thought
that
if
he
failed
he
should
know
indeed
that
he
was
a
castaway
and
give
himself
up
to
despair
he
dared
not
attempt
the
experiment
and
went
on
his
way
to
use
his
own
forcible
language
tossed
up
and
down
between
the
devil
and
his
own
ignorance
soon
after
he
had
one
of
those
visions
which
foreshadowed
the
wonderful
dream
of
his
pilgrim
progress
he
saw
some
holy
people
of
bedford
on
the
sunny
side
of
an
high
mountain
refreshing
themselves
in
the
pleasant
air
and
sunlight
while
he
was
shivering
in
cold
and
darkness
amidst
snows
and
ices
like
the
victims
of
the
scandinavian
hell
a
wall
compassed
the
mountain
separating
him
from
the
blessed
with
one
small
gap
or
doorway
through
which
with
great
pain
and
effort
he
was
at
last
enabled
to
work
his
way
into
the
sunshine
and
sit
down
with
the
saints
in
the
light
and
warmth
thereof
but
now
a
new
trouble
assailed
him
like
milton
metaphysical
spirits
who
sat
apart
and
reasoned
of
foreknowledge
will
and
fate
he
grappled
with
one
of
those
great
questions
which
have
always
perplexed
and
baffled
human
inquiry
and
upon
which
much
has
been
written
to
little
purpose
he
was
tortured
with
anxiety
to
know
whether
according
to
the
westminster
formula
he
was
elected
to
salvation
or
damnation
his
old
adversary
vexed
his
soul
with
evil
suggestions
and
even
quoted
scripture
to
enforce
them
it
may
be
you
are
not
elected
said
the
tempter
and
the
poor
tinker
thought
the
supposition
altogether
too
probable
why
then
said
satan
you
had
as
good
leave
off
and
strive
no
farther
for
if
indeed
you
should
not
be
elected
and
chosen
of
god
there
is
no
hope
of
your
being
saved
for
it
is
neither
in
him
that
willeth
nor
in
him
that
runneth
but
in
god
who
showeth
mercy
at
length
when
as
he
says
he
was
about
giving
up
the
ghost
of
all
his
hopes
this
passage
fell
with
weight
upon
his
spirit
look
at
the
generations
of
old
and
see
did
ever
any
trust
in
god
and
were
confounded
comforted
by
these
words
he
opened
his
bible
took
note
them
but
the
most
diligent
search
and
inquiry
of
his
neighbors
failed
to
discover
them
at
length
his
eye
fell
upon
them
in
the
apocryphal
book
of
ecclesiasticus
this
he
says
somewhat
doubted
him
at
first
as
the
book
was
not
canonical
but
in
the
end
he
took
courage
and
comfort
from
the
passage
i
bless
god
he
says
for
that
word
it
was
good
for
me
that
word
doth
still
oftentimes
shine
before
my
face
a
long
and
weary
struggle
was
now
before
him
i
can
not
he
says
express
with
what
longings
and
breathings
of
my
soul
i
cried
unto
christ
to
call
me
gold
could
it
have
been
gotten
by
gold
what
would
i
have
given
for
it
had
i
a
whole
world
it
had
all
gone
ten
thousand
times
over
for
this
that
my
soul
might
have
been
in
a
converted
state
how
lovely
now
was
every
one
in
my
eyes
that
i
thought
to
be
converted
men
and
women
they
shone
they
walked
like
a
people
who
carried
the
broad
seal
of
heaven
with
them
with
what
force
and
intensity
of
language
does
he
portray
in
the
following
passage
the
reality
and
earnestness
of
his
agonizing
experience
while
i
was
thus
afflicted
with
the
fears
of
my
own
damnation
there
were
two
things
would
make
me
wonder
the
one
was
when
i
saw
old
people
hunting
after
the
things
of
this
life
as
if
they
should
live
here
always
the
other
was
when
i
found
professors
much
distressed
and
cast
down
when
they
met
with
outward
losses
as
of
husband
wife
or
child
lord
thought
i
what
seeking
after
carnal
things
by
some
and
what
grief
in
others
for
the
loss
of
them
if
they
so
much
labor
after
and
shed
so
many
tears
for
the
things
of
this
present
life
how
am
i
to
be
bemoaned
pitied
and
prayed
for
my
soul
is
dying
my
soul
is
damning
were
my
soul
but
in
a
good
condition
and
were
i
but
sure
of
it
ah
i
how
rich
should
i
esteem
myself
though
blessed
but
with
bread
and
water
i
should
count
these
but
small
afflictions
and
should
bear
them
as
little
burdens
wounded
spirit
who
can
bear
he
looked
with
envy
as
he
wandered
through
the
country
upon
the
birds
in
the
trees
the
hares
in
the
preserves
and
the
fishes
in
the
streams
they
were
happy
in
their
brief
existence
and
their
death
was
but
a
sleep
he
felt
himself
alienated
from
god
a
discord
in
the
harmonies
of
the
universe
the
very
rooks
which
fluttered
around
the
old
church
spire
seemed
more
worthy
of
the
creator
love
and
care
than
himself
a
vision
of
the
infernal
fire
like
that
glimpse
of
hell
which
was
afforded
to
christian
by
the
shepherds
was
continually
before
him
with
its
rumbling
noise
and
the
cry
of
some
tormented
and
the
scent
of
brimstone
whithersoever
he
went
the
glare
of
it
scorched
him
and
its
dreadful
sound
was
in
his
ears
his
vivid
but
disturbed
imagination
lent
new
terrors
to
the
awful
figures
by
which
the
sacred
writers
conveyed
the
idea
of
future
retribution
to
the
oriental
mind
bunyan
world
of
woe
if
it
lacked
the
colossal
architecture
and
solemn
vastness
of
pandemonium
was
more
clearly
defined
its
agonies
were
within
the
pale
of
human
comprehension
its
victims
were
men
and
women
with
the
same
keen
sense
of
corporeal
suffering
which
they
possessed
in
life
and
who
to
use
his
own
terrible
description
had
all
the
loathed
variety
of
hell
to
grapple
with
fire
unquenchable
a
lake
of
choking
brimstone
eternal
chains
darkness
more
black
than
night
the
everlasting
gnawing
of
the
worm
the
sight
of
devils
and
the
yells
and
outcries
of
the
damned
his
mind
at
this
period
was
evidently
shaken
in
some
degree
from
its
balance
he
was
troubled
with
strange
wicked
thoughts
confused
by
doubts
and
blasphemous
suggestions
for
which
he
could
only
account
by
supposing
himself
possessed
of
the
devil
he
wanted
to
curse
and
swear
and
had
to
clap
his
hands
on
his
mouth
to
prevent
it
in
prayer
he
felt
as
he
supposed
satan
behind
him
pulling
his
clothes
and
telling
him
to
have
done
and
break
off
suggesting
that
he
had
better
pray
to
him
and
calling
up
before
his
mind
eye
the
figures
of
a
bull
a
tree
or
some
other
object
instead
of
the
awful
idea
of
god
he
notes
here
as
cause
of
thankfulness
that
even
in
this
dark
and
clouded
state
he
was
enabled
to
see
the
vile
and
abominable
things
fomented
by
the
quakers
to
be
errors
gradually
the
shadow
wherein
he
had
so
long
walked
beneath
the
day
broad
glare
a
darkened
man
passed
from
him
and
for
a
season
he
was
afforded
an
evidence
of
his
salvation
from
heaven
with
many
golden
seals
thereon
hanging
in
his
sight
but
ere
long
other
temptations
assailed
him
a
strange
suggestion
haunted
him
to
sell
or
part
with
his
saviour
his
own
account
of
this
hallucination
is
too
painfully
vivid
to
awaken
any
other
feeling
than
that
of
sympathy
and
sadness
i
could
neither
eat
my
food
stoop
for
a
pin
chop
a
stick
or
cast
mine
eye
to
look
on
this
or
that
but
still
the
temptation
would
come
sell
christ
for
this
or
sell
christ
for
that
sell
him
sell
him
sometimes
it
would
run
in
my
thoughts
not
so
little
as
a
hundred
times
together
sell
him
sell
him
against
which
i
may
say
for
whole
hours
together
i
have
been
forced
to
stand
as
continually
leaning
and
forcing
my
spirit
against
it
lest
haply
before
i
were
aware
some
wicked
thought
might
arise
in
my
heart
that
might
consent
thereto
and
sometimes
the
tempter
would
make
me
believe
i
had
consented
to
it
but
then
i
should
be
as
tortured
upon
a
rack
for
whole
days
together
this
temptation
did
put
me
to
such
scares
lest
i
should
at
sometimes
i
say
consent
thereto
and
be
overcome
therewith
that
by
the
very
force
of
my
mind
my
very
body
would
be
put
into
action
or
motion
by
way
of
pushing
or
thrusting
with
my
hands
or
elbows
still
answering
as
fast
as
the
destroyer
said
sell
him
i
will
not
i
will
not
i
will
not
no
not
for
thousands
thousands
thousands
of
worlds
thus
reckoning
lest
i
should
set
too
low
a
value
on
him
even
until
i
scarce
well
knew
where
i
was
or
how
to
be
composed
again
but
to
be
brief
one
morning
as
i
did
lie
in
my
bed
i
was
as
at
other
times
most
fiercely
assaulted
with
this
temptation
to
sell
and
part
with
christ
the
wicked
suggestion
still
running
in
my
mind
sell
him
sell
him
sell
him
sell
him
sell
him
as
fast
as
a
man
could
speak
against
which
also
in
my
mind
as
at
other
times
i
answered
no
no
not
for
thousands
thousands
thousands
at
least
twenty
times
together
but
at
last
after
much
striving
i
felt
this
thought
pass
through
my
heart
let
him
go
if
he
will
and
i
thought
also
that
i
felt
my
heart
freely
consent
thereto
oh
the
diligence
of
satan
oh
the
desperateness
of
man
heart
now
was
the
battle
won
and
down
fell
i
as
a
bird
that
is
shot
from
the
top
of
a
tree
into
great
guilt
and
fearful
despair
thus
getting
out
of
my
bed
i
went
moping
into
the
field
but
god
knows
with
as
heavy
a
heart
as
mortal
man
i
think
could
bear
where
for
the
space
of
two
hours
i
was
like
a
man
bereft
of
life
and
as
now
past
all
recovery
and
bound
over
to
eternal
punishment
and
withal
that
scripture
did
seize
upon
my
soul
profane
person
as
esau
who
for
one
morsel
of
meat
sold
his
birthright
for
ye
know
how
that
afterward
when
he
would
have
inherited
the
blessing
he
was
rejected
for
he
found
no
place
for
repentance
though
he
sought
it
carefully
with
tears
for
two
years
and
a
half
as
he
informs
us
that
awful
scripture
sounded
in
his
ears
like
the
knell
of
a
lost
soul
he
believed
that
he
had
committed
they
unpardonable
sin
his
mental
anguish
united
with
bodily
illness
and
suffering
his
nervous
system
became
fearfully
deranged
his
limbs
trembled
and
he
supposed
this
visible
tremulousness
and
agitation
to
be
the
mark
of
cain
with
pain
and
distressing
sensations
in
his
chest
he
began
to
fear
that
his
bone
would
split
open
and
that
he
should
perish
like
judas
iscariot
he
feared
that
the
tiles
of
the
houses
would
fall
upon
him
as
he
walked
in
the
streets
he
was
like
his
own
man
in
the
cage
at
the
house
of
the
interpreter
shut
out
from
the
promises
and
looking
forward
to
certain
judgment
methought
he
says
the
very
sun
that
shineth
in
heaven
did
grudge
to
give
me
light
and
still
the
dreadful
words
he
found
no
place
for
repentance
though
he
sought
it
carefully
with
tears
sounded
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
they
were
he
says
like
fetters
of
brass
to
his
legs
and
their
continual
clanking
followed
him
for
months
regarding
himself
elected
and
predestined
for
damnation
he
thought
that
all
things
worked
for
his
damage
and
eternal
overthrow
while
all
things
wrought
for
the
best
and
to
do
good
to
the
elect
and
called
of
god
unto
salvation
god
and
all
his
universe
had
he
thought
conspired
against
him
the
green
earth
the
bright
waters
the
sky
itself
were
written
over
with
his
irrevocable
curse
well
was
it
said
by
bunyan
contemporary
the
excellent
cudworth
in
his
eloquent
sermon
before
the
long
parliament
that
we
are
nowhere
commanded
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
god
but
the
wholesome
advice
given
us
is
this
make
our
calling
and
election
sure
we
have
no
warrant
from
scripture
to
peep
into
the
hidden
rolls
of
eternity
to
spell
out
our
names
among
the
stars
must
we
say
that
god
sometimes
to
exercise
his
uncontrollable
dominion
delights
rather
in
plunging
wretched
souls
down
into
infernal
night
and
everlasting
darkness
what
then
shall
we
make
the
god
of
the
whole
world
nothing
but
a
cruel
and
dreadful
with
curled
fiery
snakes
about
his
head
and
firebrands
in
his
hand
thus
governing
the
world
surely
this
will
make
us
either
secretly
think
there
is
no
god
in
the
world
if
he
must
needs
be
such
or
else
to
wish
heartily
there
were
none
it
was
thus
at
times
with
bunyan
he
was
tempted
in
this
season
of
despair
to
believe
that
there
was
no
resurrection
and
no
judgment
one
day
he
tells
us
a
sudden
rushing
sound
as
of
wind
or
the
wings
of
angels
came
to
him
through
the
window
wonderfully
sweet
and
pleasant
and
it
was
as
if
a
voice
spoke
to
him
from
heaven
words
of
encouragement
and
hope
which
to
use
his
language
commanded
for
the
time
a
silence
in
his
heart
to
all
those
tumultuous
thoughts
that
did
use
like
masterless
to
roar
and
bellow
and
make
a
hideous
noise
within
him
about
this
time
also
some
comforting
passages
of
scripture
were
called
to
mind
but
he
remarks
that
whenever
he
strove
to
apply
them
to
his
case
satan
would
thrust
the
curse
of
esau
in
his
face
and
wrest
the
good
word
from
him
the
blessed
promise
him
that
cometh
to
me
i
will
in
no
wise
cast
out
was
the
chief
instrumentality
in
restoring
his
lost
peace
he
says
of
it
if
ever
satan
and
i
did
strive
for
any
word
of
god
in
all
my
life
it
was
for
this
good
word
of
christ
he
at
one
end
and
i
at
the
other
oh
what
work
we
made
it
was
for
this
in
john
i
say
that
we
did
so
tug
and
strive
he
pulled
and
i
pulled
but
god
be
praised
i
overcame
him
i
got
sweetness
from
it
oh
many
a
pull
hath
my
heart
had
with
satan
for
this
blessed
sixth
chapter
of
john
who
does
not
here
call
to
mind
the
struggle
between
christian
and
apollyon
in
the
valley
that
was
no
fancy
sketch
it
was
the
narrative
of
the
author
own
grapple
with
the
spirit
of
evil
like
his
ideal
christian
he
conquered
through
him
that
loved
him
love
wrought
the
victory
the
scripture
of
forgiveness
overcame
that
of
hatred
he
never
afterwards
relapsed
into
that
state
of
religious
melancholy
from
which
he
so
hardly
escaped
he
speaks
of
his
deliverance
as
the
waking
out
of
a
troublesome
dream
his
painful
experience
was
not
lost
upon
him
for
it
gave
him
ever
after
a
tender
sympathy
for
the
weak
the
sinful
the
ignorant
and
desponding
in
some
measure
he
had
been
touched
with
the
feeling
of
their
infirmities
he
could
feel
for
those
in
the
bonds
of
sin
and
despair
as
bound
with
them
hence
his
power
as
a
preacher
hence
the
wonderful
adaptation
of
his
great
allegory
to
all
the
variety
of
spiritual
conditions
like
fearing
he
had
lain
a
month
in
the
slough
of
despond
and
had
played
like
him
the
long
melancholy
bass
of
spiritual
heaviness
with
he
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
of
the
nature
of
and
had
limped
along
his
difficult
way
upon
the
crutches
of
who
better
than
himself
could
describe
the
condition
of
despondency
and
his
daughter
in
the
dungeon
of
doubting
castle
had
he
not
also
fallen
among
thieves
like
his
account
of
his
entering
upon
the
solemn
duties
of
a
preacher
of
the
gospel
is
at
once
curious
and
instructive
he
deals
honestly
with
himself
exposing
all
his
various
moods
weaknesses
doubts
and
temptations
i
preached
he
says
what
i
felt
for
the
terrors
of
the
law
and
the
guilt
of
transgression
lay
heavy
on
my
conscience
i
have
been
as
one
sent
to
them
from
the
dead
i
went
myself
in
chains
to
preach
to
them
in
chains
and
carried
that
fire
in
my
conscience
which
i
persuaded
them
to
beware
of
at
times
when
he
stood
up
to
preach
blasphemies
and
evil
doubts
rushed
into
his
mind
and
he
felt
a
strong
desire
to
utter
them
aloud
to
his
congregation
and
at
other
seasons
when
he
was
about
to
apply
to
the
sinner
some
searching
and
fearful
text
of
scripture
he
was
tempted
to
withhold
it
on
the
ground
that
it
condemned
himself
also
but
withstanding
the
suggestion
of
the
tempter
to
use
his
own
simile
he
bowed
himself
like
samson
to
condemn
sin
wherever
he
found
it
though
he
brought
guilt
and
condemnation
upon
himself
thereby
choosing
rather
to
die
with
the
philistines
than
to
deny
the
truth
foreseeing
the
consequences
of
exposing
himself
to
the
operation
of
the
penal
laws
by
holding
conventicles
and
preaching
he
was
deeply
afflicted
at
the
thought
of
the
suffering
and
destitution
to
which
his
wife
and
children
might
be
exposed
by
his
death
or
imprisonment
nothing
can
be
more
touching
than
his
simple
and
earnest
words
on
this
point
they
show
how
warm
and
deep
were
him
human
affections
and
what
a
tender
and
loving
heart
he
laid
as
a
sacrifice
on
the
altar
of
duty
i
found
myself
a
man
compassed
with
infirmities
the
parting
with
my
wife
and
poor
children
hath
often
been
to
me
in
this
place
as
the
pulling
the
flesh
from
the
bones
and
also
it
brought
to
my
mind
the
many
hardships
miseries
and
wants
that
my
poor
family
was
like
to
meet
with
should
i
be
taken
from
them
especially
my
poor
blind
child
who
lay
nearer
my
heart
than
all
beside
oh
the
thoughts
of
the
hardships
i
thought
my
poor
blind
one
might
go
under
would
break
my
heart
to
pieces
poor
child
thought
i
what
sorrow
art
thou
like
to
have
for
thy
portion
in
this
world
thou
must
be
beaten
must
beg
suffer
hunger
cold
nakedness
and
a
thousand
calamities
though
i
can
not
now
endure
the
wind
should
blow
upon
thee
but
yet
thought
i
i
must
venture
you
all
with
god
though
it
goeth
to
the
quick
to
leave
you
oh
i
saw
i
was
as
a
man
who
was
pulling
down
his
house
upon
the
heads
of
his
wife
and
children
yet
i
thought
on
those
milch
kine
that
were
to
carry
the
ark
of
god
into
another
country
and
to
leave
their
calves
behind
them
but
that
which
helped
me
in
this
temptation
was
divers
considerations
the
first
was
the
consideration
of
those
two
scriptures
thy
fatherless
children
i
will
preserve
them
alive
and
let
thy
widows
trust
in
me
and
again
lord
said
verily
it
shall
go
well
with
thy
remnant
verily
i
will
cause
the
enemy
to
entreat
them
well
in
the
time
of
evil
he
was
arrested
in
charged
with
devilishly
and
perniciously
abstaining
from
church
and
of
being
a
common
upholder
of
conventicles
at
the
quarter
sessions
where
his
trial
seems
to
have
been
conducted
somewhat
like
that
of
faithful
at
vanity
fair
he
was
sentenced
to
perpetual
banishment
this
sentence
however
was
never
executed
but
he
was
remanded
to
bedford
jail
where
he
lay
a
prisoner
for
twelve
years
here
shut
out
from
the
world
with
no
other
books
than
the
bible
and
fox
martyrs
he
penned
that
great
work
which
has
attained
a
wider
and
more
stable
popularity
than
any
other
book
in
the
english
tongue
it
is
alike
the
favorite
of
the
nursery
and
the
study
many
experienced
christians
hold
it
only
second
to
the
bible
the
infidel
himself
would
not
willingly
let
it
die
men
of
all
sects
read
it
with
delight
as
in
the
main
a
truthful
representation
of
the
pilgrimage
without
indeed
assenting
to
all
the
doctrines
which
the
author
puts
in
the
month
of
his
fighting
sermonizer
or
which
may
be
deduced
from
some
other
portions
of
his
allegory
a
recollection
of
his
fearful
sufferings
from
misapprehension
of
a
single
text
in
the
scriptures
relative
to
the
question
of
election
we
may
suppose
gave
a
milder
tone
to
the
theology
of
his
pilgrim
than
was
altogether
consistent
with
the
calvinism
of
the
seventeenth
century
religion
says
macaulay
has
scarcely
ever
worn
a
form
so
calm
and
soothing
as
in
bunyan
allegory
in
composing
it
he
seems
never
to
have
altogether
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
in
his
struggle
with
satan
for
the
blessed
promise
recorded
by
the
apostle
of
love
the
adversary
was
generally
found
on
the
genevan
side
of
the
argument
little
did
the
persecutors
of
bunyan
dream
when
they
closed
upon
him
the
door
of
bedford
jail
that
god
would
overrule
their
poor
spite
and
envy
to
his
own
glory
and
the
worldwide
renown
of
their
victim
in
the
solitude
of
his
prison
the
ideal
forms
of
beauty
and
sublimity
which
had
long
flitted
before
him
vaguely
like
the
vision
of
the
temanite
took
shape
and
coloring
and
he
was
endowed
with
power
to
reduce
them
to
order
and
arrange
them
in
harmonious
groupings
his
powerful
imagination
no
longer
but
under
the
direction
of
reason
and
grace
expanded
his
narrow
cell
into
a
vast
theatre
lighted
up
for
the
display
of
its
wonders
to
this
creative
faculty
of
his
mind
might
have
been
aptly
applied
the
language
which
george
wither
a
contemporary
prisoner
addressed
to
his
muse
the
dull
loneness
the
black
shade
which
these
hanging
vaults
have
made
the
rude
portals
that
give
light
more
to
terror
than
delight
this
my
chamber
of
neglect
walled
about
with
disrespect
from
all
these
and
this
dull
air
a
fit
object
for
despair
she
hath
taught
me
by
her
might
to
draw
comfort
and
delight
that
stony
cell
of
his
was
to
him
like
the
rock
of
to
the
wandering
patriarch
he
saw
angels
ascending
and
descending
the
house
beautiful
rose
up
before
him
and
its
holy
sisterhood
welcomed
him
he
looked
with
his
pilgrim
from
the
chamber
of
peace
the
valley
of
humiliation
lay
stretched
out
beneath
his
eye
and
he
heard
the
curious
melodious
note
of
the
country
birds
who
sing
all
the
day
long
in
the
spring
time
when
the
flowers
appear
and
the
sun
shines
warm
and
make
the
woods
and
groves
and
solitary
places
glad
side
by
side
with
the
good
christiana
and
the
loving
mercy
he
walked
through
the
green
and
lowly
valley
fruitful
as
any
the
crow
flies
over
through
meadows
beautiful
with
lilies
the
song
of
the
poor
but
boy
who
lived
a
merry
life
and
wore
the
herb
heartsease
in
his
bosom
sounded
through
his
cell
he
that
is
down
need
fear
no
fall
he
that
is
low
no
pride
the
broad
and
pleasant
river
of
the
water
of
life
glided
peacefully
before
him
fringed
on
either
side
with
green
trees
with
all
manner
of
fruit
and
leaves
of
healing
with
meadows
beautified
with
lilies
and
green
all
the
year
long
he
saw
the
delectable
mountains
glorious
with
sunshine
overhung
with
gardens
and
orchards
and
vineyards
and
beyond
all
the
land
of
beulah
with
its
eternal
sunshine
its
song
of
birds
its
music
of
fountains
its
purple
clustered
vines
and
groves
through
which
walked
the
shining
ones
and
beautiful
what
were
bars
and
bolts
and
to
him
whose
eyes
were
anointed
to
see
and
whose
ears
opened
to
hear
the
glory
and
the
rejoicing
of
the
city
of
god
when
the
pilgrims
were
conducted
to
its
golden
gates
from
the
black
and
bitter
river
with
the
sounding
trumpeters
the
transfigured
harpers
with
their
crowns
of
gold
the
sweet
voices
of
angels
the
welcoming
peal
of
bells
in
the
holy
city
and
the
songs
of
the
redeemed
ones
in
reading
the
concluding
pages
of
the
first
part
of
pilgrim
progress
we
feel
as
if
the
mysterious
glory
of
the
beatific
vision
was
unveiled
before
us
we
are
dazzled
with
the
excess
of
light
we
are
entranced
with
the
mighty
melody
overwhelmed
by
the
great
anthem
of
rejoicing
spirits
it
can
only
be
adequately
described
in
the
language
of
milton
in
respect
to
the
apocalypse
as
a
chorus
of
hallelujahs
and
harping
symphonies
few
who
read
bunyan
nowadays
think
of
him
as
one
of
the
brave
old
english
confessors
whose
steady
and
firm
endurance
of
persecution
baffled
and
in
the
end
overcame
the
tyranny
of
the
established
church
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
what
milton
and
penn
and
locke
wrote
in
defence
of
liberty
bunyan
lived
out
and
acted
he
made
no
concessions
to
worldly
rank
dissolute
lords
and
proud
bishops
he
counted
less
than
the
humblest
and
poorest
of
his
disciples
at
bedford
when
first
arrested
and
thrown
into
prison
he
supposed
he
should
be
called
to
suffer
death
for
his
faithful
testimony
to
the
truth
and
his
great
fear
was
that
he
should
not
meet
his
fate
with
the
requisite
firmness
and
so
dishonor
the
cause
of
his
master
and
when
dark
clouds
came
over
him
and
he
sought
in
vain
for
a
sufficient
evidence
that
in
the
event
of
his
death
it
would
be
well
with
him
he
girded
up
his
soul
with
the
reflection
that
as
he
suffered
for
the
word
and
way
of
god
he
was
engaged
not
to
shrink
one
hair
breadth
from
it
i
will
leap
he
says
off
the
ladder
blindfold
into
eternity
sink
or
swim
come
heaven
come
hell
lord
jesus
if
thou
wilt
catch
me
do
if
not
i
will
venture
in
thy
name
the
english
revolution
of
the
seventeenth
century
while
it
humbled
the
false
and
oppressive
aristocracy
of
rank
and
title
was
prodigal
in
the
development
of
the
real
nobility
of
the
mind
and
heart
its
history
is
bright
with
the
footprints
of
men
whose
very
names
still
stir
the
hearts
of
freemen
the
world
over
like
a
trumpet
peal
say
what
we
may
of
its
fanaticism
laugh
as
we
may
at
its
extravagant
enjoyment
of
newly
acquired
religious
and
civil
liberty
who
shall
now
venture
to
deny
that
it
was
the
golden
age
of
england
who
that
regards
freedom
above
slavery
will
now
sympathize
with
the
outcry
and
lamentation
of
those
interested
in
the
continuance
of
the
old
order
of
things
against
the
prevalence
of
sects
and
schism
but
who
at
the
same
time
as
milton
shrewdly
intimates
dreaded
more
the
rending
of
their
pontifical
sleeves
than
the
rending
of
the
church
who
shall
now
sneer
at
puritanism
with
the
defence
of
unlicensed
printing
before
him
who
scoff
at
quakerism
over
the
journal
of
george
fox
who
shall
join
with
debauched
lordlings
and
prelates
in
ridicule
of
anabaptist
levellers
and
dippers
after
rising
from
the
perusal
of
pilgrim
progress
there
were
giants
in
those
days
and
foremost
amidst
that
band
of
and
fearing
men
the
slandered
calvinists
of
charles
time
who
fought
and
won
it
freedom
holy
fight
stands
the
subject
of
our
sketch
the
tinker
of
elstow
of
his
high
merit
as
an
author
there
is
no
longer
any
question
the
edinburgh
review
expressed
the
common
sentiment
of
the
literary
world
when
it
declared
that
the
two
great
creative
minds
of
the
seventeenth
century
were
those
which
produced
paradise
lost
and
the
pilgrim
progress
thomas
ellwood
commend
us
to
autobiographies
give
us
the
veritable
notchings
of
robinson
crusoe
on
his
stick
the
indubitable
records
of
a
life
long
since
swallowed
up
in
the
blackness
of
darkness
traced
by
a
hand
the
very
dust
of
which
has
become
undistinguishable
the
foolishest
egotist
who
ever
chronicled
his
daily
experiences
his
hopes
and
fears
poor
plans
and
vain
reachings
after
happiness
speaking
to
us
out
of
the
past
and
thereby
giving
us
to
understand
that
it
was
quite
as
real
as
our
present
is
in
no
mean
sort
our
benefactor
and
commands
our
attention
in
spite
of
his
folly
we
are
thankful
for
the
very
vanity
which
prompted
him
to
bottle
up
his
poor
records
and
cast
them
into
the
great
sea
of
time
for
future
voyagers
to
pick
up
we
note
with
the
deepest
interest
that
in
him
too
was
enacted
that
miracle
of
a
conscious
existence
the
reproduction
of
which
in
ourselves
awes
and
perplexes
us
he
too
had
a
mother
he
hated
and
loved
the
light
from
hearths
shone
over
him
he
walked
in
the
sunshine
over
the
dust
of
those
who
had
gone
before
him
just
as
we
are
now
walking
over
his
these
records
of
him
remain
the
footmarks
of
a
life
not
of
mere
animal
organism
but
of
a
being
like
ourselves
enabling
us
by
studying
their
hieroglyphic
significance
to
decipher
and
see
clearly
into
the
mystery
of
existence
centuries
ago
the
dead
generations
live
again
in
these
old
incidentally
unintentionally
yet
in
the
simplest
and
most
natural
manner
they
make
us
familiar
with
all
the
phenomena
of
life
in
the
bygone
ages
we
are
brought
in
contact
with
actual
men
and
women
not
the
ghostly
outline
figures
which
pass
for
such
in
what
is
called
history
the
horn
lantern
of
the
biographer
by
the
aid
of
which
with
painful
minuteness
he
chronicled
from
day
to
day
his
own
outgoings
and
incomings
making
visible
to
us
his
pitiful
wants
labors
trials
and
tribulations
of
the
stomach
and
of
the
conscience
sheds
at
times
a
strong
clear
light
upon
contemporaneous
activities
what
seemed
before
half
fabulous
rises
up
in
distinct
and
full
proportions
we
look
at
statesmen
philosophers
and
poets
with
the
eyes
of
those
who
lived
perchance
their
neighbors
and
sold
them
beer
and
mutton
and
household
stuffs
had
access
to
their
kitchens
and
took
note
of
the
fashion
of
their
wigs
and
the
color
of
their
breeches
without
some
such
light
all
history
would
be
just
about
as
unintelligible
and
unreal
as
a
dimly
remembered
dream
the
journals
of
the
early
friends
or
quakers
are
in
this
respect
invaluable
little
it
is
true
can
be
said
as
a
general
thing
of
their
literary
merits
their
authors
were
plain
earnest
men
and
women
chiefly
intent
upon
the
substance
of
things
and
having
withal
a
strong
testimony
to
bear
against
carnal
wit
and
outside
show
and
ornament
yet
even
the
scholar
may
well
admire
the
power
of
certain
portions
of
george
fox
journal
where
a
strong
spirit
clothes
its
utterance
in
simple
downright
saxon
words
the
quiet
and
beautiful
enthusiasm
of
pennington
the
torrent
energy
of
edward
burrough
the
serene
wisdom
of
penn
the
logical
acuteness
of
barclay
the
honest
truthfulness
of
sewell
the
wit
and
humor
of
john
roberts
for
even
quakerism
had
its
apostolic
jokers
and
robert
halls
and
last
not
least
the
simple
beauty
of
woolman
journal
the
modest
record
of
a
life
of
good
works
and
love
let
us
look
at
the
life
of
thomas
ellwood
the
book
before
us
is
a
hardly
used
philadelphia
reprint
bearing
date
of
the
original
was
published
some
sixty
years
before
it
is
not
a
book
to
be
found
in
fashionable
libraries
or
noticed
in
fashionable
reviews
but
is
none
the
less
deserving
of
attention
ellwood
was
born
in
in
the
little
town
of
crowell
in
oxfordshire
old
walter
his
father
was
of
gentlemanly
lineage
and
held
a
commission
of
the
peace
under
charles
i
one
of
his
most
intimate
friends
was
isaac
pennington
a
gentleman
of
estate
and
good
reputation
whose
wife
the
widow
of
sir
john
springette
was
a
lady
of
superior
endowments
her
only
daughter
gulielma
was
the
playmate
and
companion
of
thomas
on
making
this
family
a
visit
in
in
company
with
his
father
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
they
had
united
with
the
quakers
a
sect
then
little
known
and
everywhere
spoken
against
passing
through
the
vista
of
nearly
two
centuries
let
us
cross
the
threshold
and
look
with
the
eyes
of
young
ellwood
upon
this
quaker
family
it
will
doubtless
give
us
a
good
idea
of
the
earnest
and
solemn
spirit
of
that
age
of
religious
awakening
so
great
a
change
from
a
free
debonair
and
courtly
sort
of
behavior
which
we
had
formerly
found
there
into
so
strict
a
gravity
as
they
now
received
us
with
did
not
a
little
amuse
us
and
disappointed
our
expectations
of
such
a
pleasant
visit
as
we
had
promised
ourselves
for
my
part
i
sought
and
at
length
found
means
to
cast
myself
into
the
company
of
the
daughter
whom
i
found
gathering
flowers
in
the
garden
attended
by
her
maid
also
a
quaker
but
when
i
addressed
her
after
my
accustomed
manner
with
intention
to
engage
her
in
discourse
on
the
foot
of
our
former
acquaintance
though
she
treated
me
with
a
courteous
mien
yet
as
young
as
she
was
the
gravity
of
her
looks
and
behavior
struck
such
an
awe
upon
me
that
i
found
myself
not
so
much
master
of
myself
as
to
pursue
any
further
converse
with
her
we
staid
dinner
which
was
very
handsome
and
lacked
nothing
to
recommend
it
to
me
but
the
want
of
mirth
and
pleasant
discourse
which
we
could
neither
have
with
them
nor
by
reason
of
them
with
one
another
the
weightiness
which
was
upon
their
spirits
and
countenances
keeping
down
the
lightness
that
would
have
been
up
in
ours
not
long
after
they
made
a
second
visit
to
their
sober
friends
spending
several
days
during
which
they
attended
a
meeting
in
a
neighboring
farmhouse
where
we
are
introduced
by
ellwood
to
two
remarkable
personages
edward
burrough
the
friend
and
fearless
reprover
of
cromwell
and
by
far
the
most
eloquent
preacher
of
his
sect
and
james
nayler
whose
melancholy
of
fanaticism
cruel
sufferings
and
beautiful
repentance
is
so
well
known
to
the
readers
of
english
history
under
the
protectorate
under
the
preaching
of
these
men
and
the
influence
of
the
pennington
family
young
ellwood
was
brought
into
fellowship
with
the
quakers
of
the
old
justice
sorrow
and
indignation
at
this
sudden
blasting
of
his
hopes
and
wishes
in
respect
to
his
son
and
of
the
trials
and
difficulties
of
the
latter
in
his
new
vocation
it
is
now
scarcely
worth
while
to
speak
let
us
step
forward
a
few
years
to
considering
meantime
how
matters
political
and
spiritual
are
changed
in
that
brief
period
cromwell
the
maccabeus
of
puritanism
is
no
longer
among
men
charles
the
second
sits
in
his
place
profane
and
licentious
cavaliers
have
thrust
aside
the
independents
who
used
to
groan
approval
to
the
scriptural
illustrations
of
harrison
and
fleetwood
men
easy
of
virtue
without
sincerity
either
in
religion
or
politics
occupying
the
places
made
honorable
by
the
miltons
whitlocks
and
vanes
of
the
commonwealth
having
this
change
in
view
the
light
which
the
farthing
candle
of
ellwood
sheds
upon
one
of
these
illustrious
names
will
not
be
unwelcome
in
his
intercourse
with
penn
and
other
learned
quakers
he
had
reason
to
lament
his
own
deficiencies
in
scholarship
and
his
friend
pennington
undertook
to
put
him
in
a
way
of
remedying
the
defect
he
had
says
ellwood
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
paget
a
physician
of
note
in
london
and
he
with
john
milton
a
gentleman
of
great
note
for
learning
throughout
the
learned
world
for
the
accurate
pieces
he
had
written
on
various
subjects
and
occasions
this
person
having
filled
a
public
station
in
the
former
times
lived
a
private
and
retired
life
in
london
and
having
lost
his
sight
kept
always
a
man
to
read
for
him
which
usually
was
the
son
of
some
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
whom
in
kindness
he
took
to
improve
in
his
learning
thus
by
the
mediation
of
my
friend
isaac
pennington
with
paget
and
through
him
with
john
milton
was
i
admitted
to
come
to
him
not
as
a
servant
to
him
nor
to
be
in
the
house
with
him
but
only
to
have
the
liberty
of
coming
to
his
house
at
certain
hours
when
i
would
and
read
to
him
what
books
he
should
appoint
which
was
all
the
favor
i
desired
he
received
me
courteously
as
well
for
the
sake
of
paget
who
introduced
me
as
of
isaac
pennington
who
recommended
me
to
both
of
whom
he
bore
a
good
respect
and
having
inquired
divers
things
of
me
with
respect
to
my
former
progression
in
learning
he
dismissed
me
to
provide
myself
with
such
accommodations
as
might
be
most
suitable
to
my
studies
i
went
therefore
and
took
lodgings
as
near
to
his
house
which
was
then
in
jewen
street
as
i
conveniently
could
and
from
thenceforward
went
every
day
in
the
afternoon
except
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
and
sitting
by
him
in
his
read
to
him
such
books
in
the
latin
tongue
as
he
pleased
to
have
me
read
he
perceiving
with
what
earnest
desire
i
had
pursued
learning
gave
me
not
only
all
the
encouragement
but
all
the
help
he
could
for
having
a
curious
ear
he
understood
by
my
tone
when
i
understood
what
i
read
and
when
i
did
not
and
accordingly
would
stop
me
examine
me
and
open
the
most
difficult
passages
to
me
thanks
worthy
thomas
for
this
glimpse
into
john
milton
he
had
been
with
master
milton
as
he
calls
him
only
a
few
weeks
when
being
one
first
day
morning
at
the
bull
and
mouth
meeting
aldersgate
the
of
the
city
with
great
noise
and
clamor
headed
by
major
rosewell
fell
upon
him
and
his
friends
the
immediate
cause
of
this
onslaught
upon
quiet
worshippers
was
the
famous
plot
of
the
fifth
monarchy
men
grim
old
fanatics
who
like
the
millerites
of
the
present
day
had
been
waiting
long
for
the
personal
reign
of
christ
and
the
saints
upon
earth
and
in
their
zeal
to
hasten
such
a
consummation
had
sallied
into
london
streets
with
drawn
swords
and
loaded
matchlocks
the
government
took
strong
measures
for
suppressing
dissenters
meetings
or
conventicles
and
the
poor
quakers
although
not
at
all
implicated
in
the
disturbance
suffered
more
severely
than
any
others
let
us
look
at
the
freedom
of
conscience
and
worship
in
england
under
that
irreverent
defender
of
the
faith
charles
ii
ellwood
says
he
that
commanded
the
party
gave
us
first
a
general
charge
to
come
out
of
the
room
but
we
who
came
thither
at
god
requiring
to
worship
him
like
that
good
man
of
old
who
said
we
ought
to
obey
god
rather
than
man
stirred
not
but
kept
our
places
whereupon
he
sent
some
of
his
soldiers
among
us
with
command
to
drag
or
drive
us
out
which
they
did
roughly
enough
think
of
it
grave
men
and
women
and
modest
maidens
sitting
there
with
calm
impassive
countenances
motionless
as
death
the
pikes
of
the
soldiery
closing
about
them
in
a
circle
of
bristling
steel
brave
and
true
ones
not
in
vain
did
ye
thus
oppose
god
silence
to
the
devil
uproar
christian
endurance
and
calm
persistence
in
the
exercise
of
your
rights
as
englishmen
and
men
to
the
hot
fury
of
impatient
tyranny
from
your
day
down
to
this
the
world
has
been
the
better
for
your
faithfulness
ellwood
and
some
thirty
of
his
friends
were
marched
off
to
prison
in
old
bridewell
which
as
well
as
nearly
all
the
other
prisons
was
already
crowded
with
quaker
prisoners
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
prison
was
used
as
a
torture
chamber
i
was
almost
affrighted
says
ellwood
by
the
dismalness
of
the
place
for
besides
that
the
walls
were
all
laid
over
with
black
from
top
to
bottom
there
stood
in
the
middle
a
great
the
manner
of
whipping
there
is
to
strip
the
party
to
the
skin
from
the
waist
upward
and
having
fastened
him
to
the
so
that
he
can
neither
resist
nor
shun
the
strokes
to
lash
his
naked
body
with
long
slender
twigs
of
holly
which
will
bend
almost
like
thongs
around
the
body
and
these
having
little
knots
upon
them
tear
the
skin
and
flesh
and
give
extreme
pain
to
this
terrible
punishment
aged
men
and
delicately
nurtured
young
females
were
often
subjected
during
this
season
of
hot
persecution
from
the
bridewell
ellwood
was
at
length
removed
to
newgate
and
thrust
in
with
other
friends
amidst
the
common
felons
he
speaks
of
this
prison
with
its
thieves
murderers
and
prostitutes
its
apartments
and
loathsome
cells
as
a
hell
upon
earth
in
a
closet
adjoining
the
room
where
he
was
lodged
lay
for
several
days
the
quartered
bodies
of
phillips
tongue
and
gibbs
the
leaders
of
the
fifth
monarchy
rising
frightful
and
loathsome
as
they
came
from
the
bloody
hands
of
the
executioners
these
ghastly
remains
were
at
length
obtained
by
the
friends
of
the
dead
and
buried
the
heads
were
ordered
to
be
prepared
for
setting
up
in
different
parts
of
the
city
read
this
grim
passage
of
description
i
saw
the
heads
when
they
were
brought
to
be
boiled
the
hangman
fetched
them
in
a
dirty
basket
out
of
some
and
setting
them
down
among
the
felons
he
and
they
made
sport
of
them
they
took
them
by
the
hair
flouting
jeering
and
laughing
at
them
and
then
giving
them
some
ill
names
boxed
them
on
their
ears
and
cheeks
which
done
the
hangman
put
them
into
his
kettle
and
parboiled
them
with
and
that
to
keep
them
from
putrefaction
and
this
to
keep
off
the
fowls
from
seizing
upon
them
the
whole
sight
as
well
that
of
the
bloody
quarters
first
as
this
of
the
heads
afterwards
was
both
frightful
and
loathsome
and
begat
an
abhorrence
in
my
nature
at
the
next
session
of
the
municipal
court
at
the
old
bailey
ellwood
obtained
his
discharge
after
paying
a
visit
to
my
master
milton
he
made
his
way
to
chalfont
the
home
of
his
friends
the
penningtons
where
he
was
soon
after
engaged
as
a
latin
teacher
here
he
seems
to
have
had
his
trials
and
temptations
gulielma
springette
the
daughter
of
pennington
wife
his
old
playmate
had
now
grown
to
be
a
fair
woman
of
marriageable
age
and
as
he
informs
us
very
desirable
whether
regard
was
had
to
her
outward
person
which
wanted
nothing
to
make
her
completely
comely
or
to
the
endowments
of
her
mind
which
were
every
way
extraordinary
or
to
her
outward
fortune
which
was
fair
from
all
which
we
are
not
surprised
to
learn
that
she
was
secretly
and
openly
sought
for
by
many
of
almost
every
rank
and
condition
to
whom
continues
thomas
in
their
respective
turns
till
he
at
length
came
for
whom
she
was
reserved
she
carried
herself
with
so
much
evenness
of
temper
such
courteous
freedom
guarded
by
the
strictest
modesty
that
as
it
gave
encouragement
or
ground
of
hope
to
none
so
neither
did
it
administer
any
matter
of
offence
or
just
cause
of
complaint
to
any
beautiful
and
noble
maiden
how
the
imagination
fills
up
this
outline
limning
by
her
friend
and
if
truth
must
be
told
admirer
serene
courteous
healthful
a
ray
of
tenderest
and
blandest
light
shining
steadily
in
the
sober
gloom
of
that
old
household
confirmed
quaker
as
she
is
shrinking
from
none
of
the
responsibilities
and
dangers
of
her
profession
and
therefore
liable
at
any
time
to
the
penalties
of
prison
and
under
that
plain
garb
and
in
spite
of
that
certain
gravity
of
look
and
behavior
which
as
we
have
seen
on
one
occasion
awed
young
ellwood
into
silence
youth
beauty
and
refinement
assert
their
prerogatives
love
knows
no
creed
the
gay
and
titled
and
wealthy
crowd
around
her
suing
in
vain
for
her
favor
followed
like
the
tided
moon
she
moves
as
calmly
on
until
he
at
length
comes
for
whom
she
was
reserved
and
her
name
is
united
with
that
of
one
worthy
even
of
her
the
william
penn
meantime
one
can
not
but
feel
a
good
degree
of
sympathy
with
young
ellwood
her
old
schoolmate
and
playmate
placed
as
he
was
in
the
same
family
with
her
enjoying
her
familiar
conversation
and
unreserved
confidence
and
as
he
says
the
advantageous
opportunities
of
riding
and
walking
abroad
with
her
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
without
any
other
company
than
her
maid
for
so
great
indeed
was
the
confidence
that
her
mother
had
in
me
that
she
thought
her
daughter
safe
if
i
was
with
her
even
from
the
plots
and
designs
of
others
upon
her
so
near
and
yet
alas
in
truth
so
distant
the
serene
and
gentle
light
which
shone
upon
him
in
the
sweet
solitudes
of
chalfont
was
that
of
a
star
itself
unapproachable
as
he
himself
meekly
intimates
she
was
reserved
for
another
he
seems
to
have
fully
understood
his
own
position
in
respect
to
her
although
to
use
his
own
words
others
measuring
him
by
the
propensity
of
their
own
inclinations
concluded
he
would
steal
her
run
away
with
her
and
marry
her
little
did
these
jealous
surmisers
know
of
the
true
and
really
heroic
spirit
of
the
young
latin
master
his
own
apology
and
defence
of
his
conduct
under
circumstances
of
temptation
which
anthony
himself
could
have
scarcely
better
resisted
will
not
be
amiss
i
was
not
ignorant
of
the
various
fears
which
filled
the
jealous
heads
of
some
concerning
me
neither
was
i
so
stupid
nor
so
divested
of
all
humanity
as
not
to
be
sensible
of
the
real
and
innate
worth
and
virtue
which
adorned
that
excellent
dame
and
attracted
the
eyes
and
hearts
of
so
many
with
the
greatest
importunity
to
seek
and
solicit
her
nor
was
i
so
devoid
of
natural
heat
as
not
to
feel
some
sparklings
of
desire
as
well
as
others
but
the
force
of
truth
and
sense
of
honor
suppressed
whatever
would
have
risen
beyond
the
bounds
of
fair
and
virtuous
friendship
for
i
easily
foresaw
that
if
i
should
have
attempted
any
thing
in
a
dishonorable
way
by
fraud
or
force
upon
her
i
should
have
thereby
brought
a
wound
upon
mine
own
soul
a
foul
scandal
upon
my
religious
profession
and
an
infamous
stain
upon
mine
honor
which
was
far
more
dear
unto
me
than
my
life
wherefore
having
observed
how
some
others
had
befooled
themselves
by
misconstruing
her
common
kindness
expressed
in
an
innocent
open
free
and
familiar
conversation
springing
from
the
abundant
affability
courtesy
and
sweetness
of
her
natural
temper
to
be
the
effect
of
a
singular
regard
and
peculiar
affection
to
them
i
resolved
to
shun
the
rock
whereon
they
split
and
remembering
the
saying
of
the
poet
quem
faciunt
aliena
pericula
cantum
i
governed
myself
in
a
free
yet
respectful
carriage
towards
her
thereby
preserving
a
fair
reputation
with
my
friends
and
enjoying
as
much
of
her
favor
and
kindness
in
a
virtuous
and
firm
friendship
as
was
fit
for
her
to
show
or
for
me
to
seek
well
and
worthily
said
poor
thomas
whatever
might
be
said
of
others
thou
at
least
wast
no
coxcomb
thy
distant
and
involuntary
admiration
of
the
fair
guli
needs
however
no
excuse
poor
human
nature
guard
it
as
one
may
with
strictest
discipline
and
painfully
cramping
environment
will
sometimes
act
out
itself
and
in
thy
case
not
even
george
fox
himself
knowing
thy
beautiful
young
friend
and
doubtless
admiring
her
too
for
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
appreciate
and
honor
the
worth
and
dignity
or
woman
could
have
found
it
in
his
heart
to
censure
thee
at
this
period
as
was
indeed
most
natural
our
young
teacher
solaced
himself
with
occasional
appeals
to
what
he
calls
the
muses
there
is
reason
to
believe
however
that
the
pagan
sisterhood
whom
he
ventured
to
invoke
seldom
graced
his
study
with
their
personal
attendance
in
these
rhyming
efforts
scattered
up
and
down
his
journal
there
are
occasional
sparkles
of
genuine
wit
and
passages
of
keen
sarcasm
tersely
and
fitly
expressed
others
breathe
a
warm
devotional
feeling
in
the
following
brief
prayer
for
instance
the
wants
of
the
humble
christian
are
condensed
in
a
manner
worthy
of
quarles
or
herbert
oh
that
mine
eye
might
closed
be
to
what
concerns
me
not
to
see
that
deafness
might
possess
mine
ear
to
what
concerns
me
not
to
hear
that
truth
my
tongue
might
always
tie
from
ever
speaking
foolishly
that
no
vain
thought
might
ever
rest
or
be
conceived
in
my
breast
that
by
each
word
and
deed
and
thought
glory
may
to
my
god
be
brought
but
what
are
wishes
lord
mine
eye
on
thee
is
fixed
to
thee
i
cry
wash
lord
and
purify
my
heart
and
make
it
clean
in
every
part
and
when
is
clean
lord
keep
it
too
for
that
is
more
than
i
can
do
the
thought
in
the
following
extracts
from
a
poem
written
on
the
death
of
his
friend
pennington
son
is
trite
but
not
inaptly
or
inelegantly
expressed
what
ground
alas
has
any
man
to
set
his
heart
on
things
below
which
when
they
seem
most
like
to
stand
fly
like
the
arrow
from
the
bow
who
now
atop
erelong
shall
feel
the
circling
motion
of
the
wheel
the
world
can
not
afford
a
thing
which
to
a
mind
can
any
lasting
pleasure
bring
but
in
itself
its
grave
will
find
all
things
unto
their
centre
tend
what
had
beginning
must
have
end
no
disappointment
can
befall
us
having
him
who
all
in
all
what
can
of
pleasure
him
prevent
who
lath
the
fountain
of
content
in
the
year
a
severe
law
was
enacted
against
the
sect
called
quakers
prohibiting
their
meetings
with
the
penalty
of
banishment
for
the
third
offence
the
burden
of
the
prosecution
which
followed
fell
upon
the
quakers
of
the
metropolis
large
numbers
of
whom
were
heavily
fined
imprisoned
and
sentenced
to
be
banished
from
their
native
land
yet
in
time
our
worthy
friend
ellwood
came
in
for
his
own
share
of
trouble
in
consequence
of
attending
the
funeral
of
one
of
his
friends
an
justice
of
the
county
obtained
information
of
the
quaker
gathering
and
while
the
body
of
the
dead
was
borne
on
shoulders
through
the
street
in
order
to
be
carried
to
the
ground
which
was
at
the
town
end
says
ellwood
he
rushed
out
upon
us
with
the
constables
and
a
rabble
of
rude
fellows
whom
he
had
gathered
together
and
having
his
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
struck
one
of
the
foremost
of
the
bearers
with
it
commanding
them
to
set
down
the
coffin
but
the
friend
who
was
so
stricken
being
more
concerned
for
the
safety
of
the
dead
body
than
for
his
own
lest
it
should
fall
and
any
indecency
thereupon
follow
held
the
coffin
fast
which
the
justice
observing
and
being
enraged
that
his
word
was
not
forthwith
obeyed
set
his
hand
to
the
coffin
and
with
a
forcible
thrust
threw
it
off
from
the
shoulders
so
that
it
fell
to
the
ground
in
the
middle
of
the
street
and
there
we
were
forced
to
leave
it
for
the
constables
and
rabble
fell
upon
us
and
drew
some
and
drove
others
into
the
inn
of
those
thus
taken
continues
ellwood
i
was
one
they
picked
out
ten
of
us
and
sent
us
to
aylesbury
jail
they
caused
the
body
to
lie
in
the
open
street
and
cartway
so
that
all
travellers
that
passed
whether
horsemen
coaches
carts
or
wagons
were
fain
to
break
out
of
the
way
to
go
by
it
until
it
was
almost
night
and
then
having
caused
a
grave
to
be
made
in
the
unconsecrated
part
of
what
is
called
the
churchyard
they
forcibly
took
the
body
from
the
widow
and
buried
it
there
he
remained
a
prisoner
only
about
two
months
during
which
period
he
comforted
himself
by
such
as
follows
reminding
us
of
similar
enigmas

our
master
milton
we
left
him
deprived
of
his
young
companion
and
reader
sitting
lonely
in
his
small
in
jewen
street
it
is
now
the
year
is
not
the
pestilence
in
london
a
sinful
and
godless
city
with
its
bloated
bishops
fawning
around
the
nell
gwyns
of
a
licentious
and
profane
defender
of
the
faith
its
swaggering
and
drunken
cavaliers
its
ribald
jesters
its
obscene
its
loathsome
prisons
crowded
with
godfearing
men
and
women
is
not
the
measure
of
its
iniquity
already
filled
up
three
years
only
have
passed
since
the
terrible
prayer
of
vane
went
upward
from
the
scaffold
on
tower
hill
when
my
blood
is
shed
upon
the
block
let
it
o
god
have
a
voice
afterward
audible
to
thy
ear
o
bosom
friend
of
the
martyr
has
that
blood
cried
from

and
now
how
fearfully
is
it
answered
like
the
ashes
which
the
seer
of
the
hebrews
cast
towards
heaven
it
has
returned
in
boils
and
blains
upon
the
proud
and
oppressive
city
john
milton
sitting
blind
in
jewen
street
has
heard
the
toll
of
the
and
the
nightlong
rumble
of
the
and
the
terrible
summons
bring
out
your
dead
the
angel
of
the
plague
in
yellow
mantle
walks
the
streets
why
should
he
tarry
in
a
doomed
city
forsaken
of
god
is
not
the
command
even
to
him
arise
and
flee
for
thy
life
in
some
green
nook
of
the
quiet
country
he
may
finish
the
great
work
which
his
hands
have
found
to
do
he
bethinks
him
of
his
old
friends
the
penningtons
and
his
young
quaker
companion
the
patient
and
gentle
ellwood
wherefore
says
the
latter
some
little
time
before
i
went
to
aylesbury
jail
i
was
desired
by
my
quondam
master
milton
to
take
an
house
for
him
in
the
neighborhood
where
i
dwelt
that
he
might
go
out
of
the
city
for
the
safety
of
himself
and
his
family
the
pestilence
then
growing
hot
in
london
i
took
a
pretty
box
for
him
in
giles
chalfont
a
mile
from
me
of
which
i
gave
him
notice
and
intended
to
have
waited
on
him
and
seen
him
well
settled
but
was
prevented
by
that
imprisonment
but
now
being
released
and
returned
home
i
soon
made
a
visit
to
him
to
welcome
him
into
the
country
after
some
common
discourse
had
passed
between
us
he
called
for
a
manuscript
of
his
which
having
brought
he
delivered
to
me
bidding
me
take
it
home
with
me
and
read
it
at
my
leisure
and
when
i
had
so
done
return
it
to
him
with
my
judgment
thereupon
now
what
does
the
reader
think
young
ellwood
carried
in
his
gray
coat
pocket
across
the
dikes
and
hedges
and
through
the
green
lanes
of
giles
chalfont
that
autumn
day
let
us
look
farther
when
i
came
home
and
had
set
myself
to
read
it
i
found
it
was
that
excellent
poem
which
he
entitled
after
i
had
with
the
best
attention
read
it
through
i
made
him
another
visit
and
returning
his
book
with
due
acknowledgment
of
the
favor
he
had
done
me
in
communicating
it
to
me
he
asked
me
how
i
liked
it
and
what
i
thought
of
it
which
i
modestly
but
freely
told
him
and
after
some
farther
discourse
about
it
i
pleasantly
said
to
him
hast
said
much
here
of
paradise
lost
what
hast
thou
to
say
of
paradise
found
he
made
me
no
answer
but
sat
some
time
in
a
muse
then
brake
off
that
discourse
and
fell
upon
another
subject
i
modestly
but
freely
told
him
what
i
thought
of
paradise
lost
what
he
told
him
remains
a
mystery
one
would
like
to
know
more
precisely
what
the
first
critical
reader
of
that
song
of
man
first
disobedience
thought
of
it
fancy
the
young
quaker
and
blind
milton
sitting
some
pleasant
afternoon
of
the
autumn
of
that
old
year
in
the
pretty
box
at
chalfont
the
soft
wind
through
the
open
window
lifting
the
thin
hair
of
the
glorious
old
poet
england
and
accursed
with
her
faithless
church
and
libertine
king
knows
little
of
poor
master
milton
and
takes
small
note
of
his
puritanic
alone
with
his
humble
friend
he
sits
there
conning
over
that
poem
which
he
fondly
hoped
the
world
which
had
grown
all
dark
and
strange
to
the
author
would
not
willingly
let
die
the
suggestion
in
respect
to
paradise
found
to
which
as
we
have
seen
he
made
no
answer
but
sat
some
time
in
a
muse
seems
not
to
have
been
lost
for
after
the
sickness
was
over
continues
ellwood
and
the
city
well
cleansed
and
become
safely
habitable
again
he
returned
thither
and
when
afterwards
i
waited
on
him
there
which
i
seldom
failed
of
doing
whenever
my
occasions
drew
me
to
london
he
showed
me
his
second
poem
called
paradise
gained
and
in
a
pleasant
tone
said
to
me
is
owing
to
you
for
you
put
it
into
my
head
by
the
question
you
put
to
me
at
chalfont
which
before
i
had
not
thought
of
golden
days
were
these
for
the
young
latin
reader
even
if
it
be
true
as
we
suspect
that
he
was
himself
very
far
from
appreciating
the
glorious
privilege
which
he
enjoyed
of
the
familiar
friendship
and
confidence
of
milton
but
they
could
not
last
his
amiable
host
isaac
pennington
a
blameless
and
quiet
country
gentleman
was
dragged
from
his
house
by
a
military
force
and
lodged
in
aylesbury
jail
his
wife
and
family
forcibly
ejected
from
their
pleasant
home
which
was
seized
upon
by
the
government
as
security
for
the
fines
imposed
upon
its
owner
the
plague
was
in
the
village
of
aylesbury
and
in
the
very
prison
itself
but
the
mary
pennington
followed
her
husband
sharing
with
him
the
dark
peril
poor
ellwood
while
attending
a
monthly
meeting
at
hedgerly
with
six
others
among
them
one
morgan
watkins
a
poor
old
welshman
who
painfully
endeavoring
to
utter
his
testimony
in
his
own
dialect
was
suspected
by
the
dogberry
of
a
justice
of
being
a
jesuit
trolling
over
his
latin
was
arrested
and
committed
to
wiccomb
house
of
correction
this
was
a
time
of
severe
trial
for
the
sect
with
which
ellwood
had
connected
himself
in
the
very
midst
of
the
pestilence
when
thousands
perished
weekly
in
london
quakers
were
marched
through
the
almost
deserted
streets
and
placed
on
board
a
ship
for
the
purpose
of
being
conveyed
according
to
their
sentence
of
banishment
to
the
west
indies
the
ship
lay
for
a
long
time
with
many
others
similarly
situated
a
helpless
prey
to
the
pestilence
through
that
terrible
autumn
the
prisoners
sat
waiting
for
the
summons
of
the
ghastly
destroyer
and
from
their
floating
dungeon
heard
the
groan
of
agonizing
ships
from
shore
to
shore
heard
nightly
plunged
beneath
the
sullen
wave
the
frequent
corse
when
the
vessel
at
length
set
sail
of
the
who
went
on
board
only

dutch
privateer

where
they
were
set
at
liberty
the
condition
of
the
jails
in
the
city
where
were
large
numbers
of
quakers
was
dreadful
in
the
extreme
ill
ventilated
crowded
and
loathsome

the
accumulated
filth
of
centuries
they

which
daily
decimated

forth

the

if
ye

whom
the
lord
loveth
he

save
at
his
pleasure
hath
he
begun
to
break
our
bonds
and
deliver
us
and
shall
we
now
distrust
him
are
we
in
a
worse
condition
than
israel
was
when
the
sea
was
before
them
the
mountains
on
either
side
and
the
egyptians
behind
pursuing
them
brave
men
and
faithful
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
present
generation
how
quietly
reaping
the
fruit
of
your
heroic
endurance
should
see
eye
to
eye
with
you
in
respect
to
all
your
testimonies
and
beliefs
in
order
to
recognize
your
claim
to
gratitude
and
admiration
for
in
an
age
of
hypocritical
hollowness
and
mean
when
with
noble
exceptions
the
very
puritans
of
cromwell
reign
of
the
saints
were
taking
profane
lessons
from
their
old
enemies
and
putting
on
an
outside
show
of
conformity
for
the
sake
of
place
or
pardon
ye
maintained
the
austere
dignity
of
virtue
and
with
king
and
church
and
parliament
arrayed
against
you
vindicated
the
rights
of

at
the
cost
of
home
fortune
and
life
english
liberty
owes
more
to
your
unyielding
firmness
than
to
the
blows
stricken
for
her
at
worcester
and
naseby
in
we
find
the
latin
teacher
in
attendance
at
a
great
meeting
of
friends
in
london
convened
at
the
suggestion
of
george
fox
for
the
purpose
of
settling
a
little
difficulty
which
had
arisen
among
the
friends
even
under
the
pressure
of
the
severest
persecution
relative
to
the
very
important
matter
of
wearing
the
hat
george
fox
in
his
love
of
truth
and
sincerity
in
word
and
action
had
discountenanced
the
fashionable
doffing
of
the
hat
and
other
flattering
obeisances
towards
men
holding
stations
in
church
or
state
as
savoring
of
giving
to
the
creature
the
reverence
only
due
to
the
creator
as
undignified
and
wanting
in
due
and
tending
to
support
unnatural
and
oppressive
distinctions
among
those
equal
in
the
sight
of
god
but
some
of
his
disciples
evidently
made
much
more
of
this
hat
testimony
than
their
teacher
one
john
perrott
who
had
just
returned
from
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
convert
the
pope
at
rome
where
that
dignitary
after
listening
to
his
exhortations
and
finding
him
in
no
condition
to
be
benefited
by
the
spiritual
physicians
of
the
inquisition
had
quietly
turned
him
over
to
the
temporal
ones
of
the
insane
hospital
had
broached
the
doctrine
that
in
public
or
private
worship
the
hat
was
not
to
be
taken
off
without
an
immediate
revelation
or
call
to
do
so
ellwood
himself
seems
to
have
been
on
the
point
of
yielding
to
this
notion
which
appears
to
have
been
the
occasion
of
a
good
deal
of
dissension
and
scandal
under
these
circumstances
to
save
truth
from
reproach
and
an
important
testimony
to
the
essential
equality
of
mankind
from
running
into
sheer
fanaticism
fox
summoned
his
tried
and
faithful
friends
together
from
all
parts
of
the
united
kingdom
and
as
it
appears
with
the
happiest
result
were
discountenanced
good
order
and
harmony
reestablished
and
john
perrott
beaver
and
the
crazy
head
under
it
were
from
thenceforth
powerless
for
evil
let
those
who
are
disposed
to
laugh
at
this
notable
ecumenical
council
of
the
hat
consider
that
ecclesiastical
history
has
brought
down
to
us
the
records
of
many
larger
and
more
imposing
convocations
wherein
grave
bishops
and
learned
fathers
took
each
other
by
the
beard
upon
matters
of
far
less
practical
importance
in
we
find
ellwood
engaged
in
escorting
his
fair
friend
gulielma
to
her
uncle
residence
in
sussex
passing
through
london
and
taking
the
tunbridge
road
they
stopped
at
seven
oak
to
dine
the
duke
of
york
was
on
the
road
with
his
guards
and
and
the
inn
was
filled
with
a
rude
company
hastening
says
ellwood
from
a
place
where
we
found
nothing
but
rudeness
the
roysterers
who
swarmed
there
besides
the
damning
oaths
they
belched
out
against
each
other
looked
very
sourly
upon
us
as
if
they
grudged
us
the
horses
which
we
rode
and
the
clothes
we
wore
they
had
proceeded
but
a
little
distance
when
they
were
overtaken
by
some
half
dozen
drunken
cavaliers
of
the
wildrake
stamp
in
full
pursuit
after
the
beautiful
quakeress
one
of
them
impudently
attempted
to
pull
her
upon
his
horse
before
him
but
was
held
at
bay
by
ellwood
who
seems
on
this
occasion
to
have
relied
somewhat
upon
his
stick
in
defending
his
fair
charge
calling
up
gulielma
servant
he
bade
him
ride
on
one
side
of
his
mistress
while
he
guarded
her
on
the
other
but
he
says
ellwood
not
thinking
it
perhaps
decent
to
ride
so
near
his
mistress
left
room
enough
for
another
to
ride
between
in
dashed
the
drunken
retainer
and
gulielma
was
once
more
in
peril
it
was
clearly
no
time
for
exhortations
and
expostulations
so
says
ellwood
i
chopped
in
upon
him
by
a
nimble
turn
and
kept
him
at
bay
i
told
him
i
had
hitherto
spared
him
but
wished
him
not
to
provoke
me
further
this
i
spoke
in
such
a
tone
as
bespoke
an
high
resentment
of
the
abuse
put
upon
us
and
withal
pressed
him
so
hard
with
my
horse
that
i
suffered
him
not
to
come
up
again
to
guli
by
this
time
it
became
evident
to
the
companions
of
the
ruffianly
assailant
that
the
young
quaker
was
in
earnest
and
they
hastened
to
interfere
for
they
says
ellwood
seeing
the
contest
rise
so
high
and
probably
fearing
it
would
rise
higher
not
knowing
where
it
might
stop
came
in
to
part
us
which
they
did
by
taking
him
away
escaping
from
these
sons
of
belial
ellwood
and
his
fair
companion
rode
on
through
tunbridge
wells
the
street
thronged
with
men
who
looked
very
earnestly
at
them
but
offered
them
no
affront
and
arrived
late
at
night
in
a
driving
rain
at
the
of
herbert
springette
the
fiery
old
gentleman
was
so
indignant
at
the
insult
offered
to
his
niece
that
he
was
with
difficulty
dissuaded
from
demanding
satisfaction
at
the
hands
of
the
duke
of
york
this
seems
to
have
been
his
last
ride
with
gulielma
she
was
soon
after
married
to
william
penn
and
took
up
her
abode
at
worminghurst
in
sussex
how
blessed
and
beautiful
was
that
union
may
be
understood
from
the
following
paragraph
of
a
letter
written
by
her
husband
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
for
america
to
lay
the
foundations
of
a
christian
colony
my
dear
wife
remember
thou
wast
the
love
of
my
youth
and
much
the
joy
of
my
life
the
most
beloved
as
well
as
the
most
worthy
of
all
my
earthly
comforts
and
the
reason
of
that
love
was
more
thy
inward
than
thy
outward
excellences
which
yet
were
many
god
knows
and
thou
knowest
it
i
can
say
it
was
a
match
of
providence
making
and
god
image
in
us
both
was
the
first
thing
and
the
most
amiable
and
engaging
ornament
in
our
eyes
about
this
time
our
friend
thomas
seeing
that
his
old
playmate
at
chalfont
was
destined
for
another
turned
his
attention
towards
a
young
friend
named
mary
ellis
he
had
been
for
several
years
acquainted
with
her
but
now
he
found
his
heart
secretly
drawn
and
inclining
towards
her
at
length
he
tells
us
as
i
was
sitting
all
alone
waiting
upon
the
lord
for
counsel
and
guidance
in
this
in
itself
and
to
me
important
affair
i
felt
a
word
sweetly
arise
in
me
as
if
i
had
heard
a
voice
which
said
go
and
prevail
and
faith
springing
in
my
heart
at
the
word
i
immediately
rose
and
went
nothing
doubting
on
arriving
at
her
residence
he
states
that
he
solemnly
opened
his
mind
to
her
which
was
a
great
surprisal
to
her
for
she
had
taken
in
an
apprehension
as
others
had
also
done
that
his
eye
had
been
fixed
elsewhere
and
nearer
home
i
used
not
many
words
to
her
he
continues
but
i
felt
a
divine
power
went
along
with
the
words
and
fixed
the
matter
expressed
by
them
so
fast
in
her
breast
that
as
she
afterwards
acknowledged
to
me
she
could
not
shut
it
out
i
continued
he
says
my
visits
to
my
friend
until
we
married
which
was
on
the
day
of
the
eighth
month
we
took
each
other
in
a
select
meeting
of
the
ancient
and
grave
friends
of
that
country
a
very
solemn
meeting
it
was
and
in
a
weighty
frame
of
spirit
we
were
his
wife
seems
to
have
had
some
estate
and
ellwood
with
that
nice
sense
of
justice
which
marked
all
his
actions
immediately
made
his
will
securing
to
her
in
case
of
his
decease
all
her
own
goods
and
moneys
as
well
as
all
that
he
had
himself
acquired
before
marriage
which
he
tells
was
indeed
but
little
yet
by
all
that
little
more
than
i
had
ever
given
her
ground
to
expect
with
me
his
father
who
was
yet
unreconciled
to
the
son
religious
views
found
fault
with
his
marriage
on
the
ground
that
it
was
unlawful
and
unsanctioned
by
priest
or
liturgy
and
consequently
refused
to
render
him
any
pecuniary
assistance
yet
in
spite
of
this
and
other
trials
he
seems
to
have
preserved
his
serenity
of
spirit
after
an
unpleasant
interview
with
his
father
on
one
occasion
he
wrote
at
his
lodgings
in
an
inn
in
london
what
he
calls
song
of
an
extract
from
it
will
serve
to
show
the
spirit
of
the
good
man
in
affliction
unto
the
glory
of
thy
holy
name
eternal
god
whom
i
both
love
and
fear
i
hereby
do
declare
i
never
came
before
thy
throne
and
found
thee
loath
to
hear
but
always
ready
with
an
open
ear
and
though
sometimes
thou
thy
face
to
hide
as
one
that
had
withdrawn
his
love
from
me
is
that
my
faith
may
to
the
full
be
tried
and
that
i
thereby
may
the
better
see
how
weak
i
am
when
not
upheld
by
thee
the
next
year
an
act
of
parliament
in
relation
to
conventicles
provided
that
any
person
who
should
be
present
at
any
meeting
under
color
or
pretence
of
any
exercise
of
religion
in
other
manner
than
according
to
the
liturgy
and
practice
of
the
church
of
england
should
be
liable
to
fines
of
from
five
to
ten
shillings
and
any
person
preaching
at
or
giving
his
house
for
the
meeting
to
a
fine
of
twenty
pounds
one
third
of
the
fines
being
received
by
the
informer
or
informers
as
a
natural
consequence
of
such
a
law
the
vilest
scoundrels
in
the
land
set
up
the
trade
of
informers
and
wherever
a
dissenting
meeting
or
burial
took
place
there
was
sure
to
be
a
mercenary
spy
ready
to
bring
a
complaint
against
all
in
attendance
the
independents
and
baptists
ceased
in
a
great
measure
to
hold
public
meetings
yet
even
they
did
not
escape
prosecution
bunyan
for
instance
in
these
days
was
dreaming
like
another
jacob
of
angels
ascending
and
descending
in
bedford
prison
but
upon
the
poor
quakers
fell
as
usual
the
great
force
of
the
unjust
enactment
some
of
these
spies
or
informers
men
of
sharp
wit
close
countenances
pliant
tempers
and
skill
in
dissimulation
took
the
guise
of
quakers
independents
or
baptists
as
occasion
required
thrusting
themselves
into
the
meetings
of
the
proscribed
sects
ascertaining
the
number
who
attended
their
rank
and
condition
and
then
informing
against
them
ellwood
in
his
journal
for
describes
several
of
these
emissaries
of
evil
one
of
them
came
to
a
friend
house
in
bucks
professing
to
be
a
brother
in
the
faith
but
overdoing
his
counterfeit
quakerism
was
detected
and
dismissed
by
his
host
betaking
himself
to
the
inn
he
appeared
in
his
true
character
drank
and
swore
roundly
and
confessed
over
his
cups
that
he
had
been
sent
forth
on
his
mission
by
the
rev
mew
chancellor
of
oxford
finding
little
success
in
counterfeiting
quakerism
he
turned
to
the
baptists
where
for
a
time
he
met
with
better
success
ellwood
at
this
time
rendered
good
service
to
his
friends
by
exposing
the
true
character
of
these
wretches
and
bringing
them
to
justice
for
theft
perjury
and
other
misdemeanors
while
this
storm
of
persecution
lasted
a
period
of
two
or
three
years
the
different
dissenting
sects
felt
in
some
measure
a
common
sympathy
and
while
guarding
themselves
against
their
common
foe
had
little
leisure
for
controversy
with
each
other
but
as
was
natural
the
abatement
of
their
mutual
suffering
and
danger
was
the
signal
for
renewing
their
suspended
quarrels
the
baptists
fell
upon
the
quakers
with
pamphlet
and
sermon
the
latter
replied
in
the
same
way
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
of
the
baptist
disputants
was
the
famous
jeremy
ives
with
whom
our
friend
ellwood
seems
to
have
had
a
good
deal
of
trouble
his
name
says
ellwood
was
up
for
a
topping
disputant
he
was
well
read
in
the
fallacies
of
logic
and
was
ready
in
framing
syllogisms
his
chief
art
lay
in
tickling
the
humor
of
rude
unlearned
and
injudicious
hearers
the
following
piece
of
ellwood
entitled
an
epitaph
for
jeremy
ives
will
serve
to
show
that
wit
and
drollery
were
sometimes
found
even
among
the
proverbially
sober
quakers
of
the
seventeenth
century
beneath
this
stone
depressed
doth
lie
the
mirror
of
hypocrisy
ives
whose
mercenary
tongue
like
a
weathercock
was
hung
and
did
this
or
that
way
play
as
advantage
led
the
way
if
well
hired
he
would
dispute
otherwise
he
would
be
mute
but
he
bawl
for
half
a
day
if
he
knew
and
liked
his
pay
for
his
person
let
it
pass
only
note
his
face
was
brass
his
heart
was
like
a
and
for
conscience
he
had
none
of
earth
and
air
he
was
composed
with
water
round
about
enclosed
earth
in
him
had
greatest
share
questionless
his
life
lay
there
thence
his
cankered
envy
sprung
poisoning
both
his
heart
and
tongue
air
made
him
frothy
light
and
vain
and
puffed
him
with
a
proud
disdain
into
the
water
oft
he
went
and
through
the
water
many
sent
that
was
ye
know
his
element
the
greatest
odds
that
did
appear
was
this
for
aught
that
i
can
hear
that
he
in
cold
did
others
dip
but
did
himself
hot
water
sip
and
his
cause
he
never
doubt
if
well
soak
night
in
stout
but
meanwhile
he
must
not
lack
brandy
and
a
draught
of
sack
one
dispute
would
shrink
a
bottle
of
three
pints
if
not
a
pottle
one
would
think
he
fetched
from
thence
all
his
dreamy
eloquence
let
us
now
bring
back
the
sot
to
his
aqua
vita
pot
and
observe
with
some
content
how
he
framed
his
argument
that
his
whistle
he
might
wet
the
bottle
to
his
mouth
he
set
and
being
master
of
that
art
thence
he
drew
the
major
part
but
left
the
minor
still
behind
good
reason
why
he
wanted
wind
if
his
breath
would
have
held
out
he
had
conclusion
drawn
no
doubt
the
residue
of
ellwood
life
seems
to
have
glided
on
in
serenity
and
peace
he
wrote
at
intervals
many
pamphlets
in
defence
of
his
society
and
in
favor
of
liberty
of
conscience
at
his
hospitable
residence
the
leading
spirits
of
the
sect
were
warmly
welcomed
george
fox
and
william
penn
seem
to
have
been
frequent
guests
we
find
that
in
he
was
arrested
for
seditious
publications
when
on
the
eve
of
hastening
to
his
early
friend
gulielma
who
in
the
absence
of
her
husband
governor
penn
had
fallen
dangerously
on
coming
before
the
judge
i
told
him
says
ellwood
that
i
had
that
morning
received
an
express
out
of
sussex
that
william
penn
wife
with
whom
i
had
an
intimate
acquaintance
and
strict
friendship
ipsis
fere
at
least
teneris
lay
now
ill
not
without
great
danger
and
that
she
had
expressed
her
desire
that
i
would
come
to
her
as
soon
as
i
could
the
judge
said
he
was
very
sorry
for
madam
penn
illness
of
whose
virtues
he
spoke
very
highly
but
not
more
than
was
her
due
then
he
told
me
that
for
her
sake
he
would
do
what
he
could
to
further
my
visit
to
her
escaping
from
the
hands
of
the
law
he
visited
his
friend
who
was
by
this
time
in
a
way
of
recovery
and
on
his
return
learned
that
the
prosecution
had
been
abandoned
at
about
this
date
his
narrative
ceases
we
learn
from
other
sources
that
he
continued
to
write
and
print
in
defence
of
his
religious
views
up
to
the
year
of
his
death
which
took
place
in
one
of
his
productions
a
poetical
version
of
the
life
of
david
may
be
still
met
with
in
the
old
quaker
libraries
on
the
score
of
poetical
merit
it
is
about
on
a
level
with
michael
drayton
verses
on
the
same
subject
as
the
history
of
one
of
the
firm
confessors
of
the
old
struggle
for
religious
freedom
of
a
and
pleasant
scholar
the
friend
of
penn
and
milton
and
the
suggester
of
paradise
regained
we
trust
our
hurried
sketch
has
not
been
altogether
without
interest
and
that
whatever
may
be
the
religious
views
of
our
readers
they
have
not
failed
to
recognize
a
good
and
true
man
in
thomas
ellwood
james
nayler
you
will
here
read
the
true
story
of
that
much
injured
ridiculed
man
james
nayler
what
dreadful
sufferings
with
what
patience
he
endured
even
to
the
boring
of
the
tongue
with
hot
irons
without
a
murmur
and
with
what
strength
of
mind
when
the
delusion
he
had
fallen
into
which
they
stigmatized
as
blasphemy
had
given
place
to
clearer
thoughts
he
could
renounce
his
error
in
a
strain
of
the
beautifullest
humility
essays
of
elia
would
that
carlyle
could
now
try
his
hand
at
the
english
revolution
was
our
exclamation
on
laying
down
the
last
volume
of
his
remarkable
history
of
the
french
revolution
with
its
brilliant
and
startling
pictures
still
flashing
before
us
to
some
extent
this
wish
has
been
realized
in
the
letters
and
speeches
of
oliver
cromwell
yet
we
confess
that
the
perusal
of
these
volumes
has
disappointed
us
instead
of
giving
himself
free
scope
as
in
his
french
revolution
and
transferring
to
his
canvas
all
the
wild
and
ludicrous

terrible
and
beautiful
phases
of
that
moral
phenomenon
he
has
here
concentrated
all
his
artistic
skill
upon
a
single
figure
whom
he
seems
to
have
regarded
as
the
embodiment
and
hero
of
the
great
event
all
else
on
his
canvas
is
subordinated
to
the
grim
image
of
the
colossal
puritan
intent
upon
presenting
him
as
the
fitting
object
of
that
which
in
its
blind
admiration
and
adoration
of
mere
abstract
power
seems
to
us
at
times
nothing
less
than
he
dwarfs
casts
into
the
shadow
nay
in
some
instances
caricatures
and
distorts
the
figures
which
surround
him
to
excuse
cromwell
in
his
usurpation
henry
vane
one
of
those
exalted
and
noble
characters
upon
whose
features
the
lights
held
by
historical
friends
or
foes
detect
no
blemish
is
dismissed
with
a
sneer
and
an
utterly
unfounded
imputation
of
dishonesty
to
reconcile
in
some
degree
the
discrepancy
between
the
declarations
of
cromwell
in
behalf
of
freedom
of
conscience
and
that
mean
and
cruel
persecution
which
the
quakers
suffered
under
the
protectorate
the
generally
harmless
fanaticism
of
a
few
individuals
bearing
that
name
is
gravely
urged
nay
the
fact
that
some
enthusiasts
undertook
to
bring
about
the
millennium
by
associating
together
cultivating
the
earth
and
dibbling
beans
for
the
new
jerusalem
market
is
regarded
by
our
author
as
the
germ
of
quakerism
and
furnishes
an
occasion
for
sneering
at
my
poor
friend
dryasdust
lamentably
tearing
his
hair
over
the
intolerance
of
that
old
time
to
quakerism
and
such
like
the
readers
of
this
with
all
its
faults
powerfully
written
biography
can
not
fail
to
have
been
impressed
with
the
intensely
graphic
description
part
vol
pp
of
the
entry
of
the
poor
fanatic
james
nayler
and
his
forlorn
and
draggled
companions
into
bristol
sadly
ludicrous
is
it
affecting
us
like
the
actual
sight
of
tragic
insanity
enacting
its
involuntary
comedy
and
making
us
smile
through
our
tears
in
another
portion
of
the
work
a
brief
account
is
given
of
the
trial
and
sentence
of
nayler
also
in
the
view
and
the
poor
man
is
dismissed
with
the
simple
intimation
that
after
his
punishment
he
repented
and
confessed
himself
mad
it
was
no
part
of
the
business
we
are
well
aware
to
waste
time
and
words
upon
the
history
of
such
a
man
as
nayler
he
was
of
no
importance
to
him
otherwise
than
as
one
of
the
disturbing
influences
in
the
government
of
the
lord
protector
but
in
our
mind
the
story
of
james
nayler
has
always
been
one
of
interest
and
in
the
belief
that
it
will
prove
so
to
others
who
like
charles
lamb
can
appreciate
the
beautiful
humility
of
a
forgiven
spirit
we
have
taken
some
pains
to
collect
and
embody
the
facts
of
it
james
nayler
was
born
in
the
parish
of
ardesley
in
yorkshire
his
father
was
a
substantial
farmer
of
good
repute
and
competent
estate
and
be
in
consequence
received
a
good
education
at
the
age
of
he
married
and
removed
to
wakefield
parish
which
has
since
been
made
classic
ground
by
the
pen
of
goldsmith
here
an
honest
farmer
he
tilled
his
soil
and
alternated
between
and
independent
conventicles
in
he
obeyed
the
summons
of
my
lord
fairfax
and
the
parliament
and
joined
a
troop
of
horse
composed
of
sturdy
independents
doing
such
signal
service
against
the
man
of
belial
charles
stuart
that
he
was
promoted
to
the
rank
of
quartermaster
in
which
capacity
he
served
under
general
lambert
in
his
scottish
campaign
disabled
at
length
by
sickness
he
was
honorably
dismissed
from
the
service
and
returned
to
his
family
in
for
three
or
four
years
he
continued
to
attend
the
meetings
of
the
independents
as
a
zealous
and
devout
member
but
it
so
fell
out
that
in
the
winter
of
george
fox
who
had
just
been
released
from
a
cruel
imprisonment
in
derby
jail
felt
a
call
to
set
his
face
towards
yorkshire
so
travelling
says
fox
in
his
journal
through
the
countries
to
several
places
preaching
repentance
and
the
word
of
life
i
came
into
the
parts
about
wakefield
where
james
navler
lived
the
worn
and
weary
soldier
covered
with
the
scars
of
outward
battle
received
as
he
believed
in
the
cause
of
god
and
his
people
against
antichrist
and
oppression
welcomed
with
thankfulness
the
veteran
of
another
warfare
who
in
conflict
with
a
principalities
and
powers
and
spiritual
wickedness
in
high
places
had
made
his
name
a
familiar
one
in
every
english
hamlet
he
and
thomas
goodyear
says
fox
came
to
me
and
were
both
convinced
and
received
the
truth
he
soon
after
joined
the
society
of
friends
in
the
spring
of
the
next
year
he
was
in
his
field
following
his
plough
and
meditating
as
he
was
wont
on
the
great
questions
of
life
and
duty
when
he
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
bidding
him
go
out
from
his
kindred
and
his
father
house
with
an
assurance
that
the
lord
would
be
with
him
while
laboring
in
his
service
deeply
impressed
he
left
his
employment
and
returning
to
his
house
made
immediate
preparations
for
a
journey
but
hesitation
and
doubt
followed
he
became
sick
from
anxiety
of
mind
and
his
recovery
for
a
time
was
exceedingly
doubtful
on
his
restoration
to
bodily
health
he
obeyed
what
he
regarded
as
a
clear
intimation
of
duty
and
went
forth
a
preacher
of
the
doctrines
he
had
embraced
the
independent
minister
of
the
society
to
which
he
had
formerly
belonged
sent
after
him
the
story
that
he
was
the
victim
of
sorcery
that
george
fox
carried
with
him
a
bottle
out
of
which
he
made
people
drink
and
that
the
draught
had
the
power
to
change
a
presbyterian
or
independent
into
a
quaker
at
once
that
in
short
the
fox
was
a
wizard
and
could
be
seen
at
the
same
moment
of
time
riding
on
the
same
black
horse
in
two
places
widely
separated
he
had
scarcely
commenced
his
exhortations
before
the
mob
excited
by
such
stories
assailed
him
in
the
early
summer
of
the
year
we
hear
of
him
in
appleby
jail
on
his
release
he
fell
in
company
with
george
fox
at
walney
island
he
was
furiously
assaulted
and
beaten
with
clubs
and
stones
the
poor
fishermen
being
fully
persuaded
that
they
were
dealing
with
a
wizard
the
spirit
of
the
man
under
these
circumstances
may
be
seen
in
the
following
extract
from
a
letter
to
his
friends
dated
at
killet
in
lancashire
the
of
month
dear
friends
dwell
in
patience
and
wait
upon
the
lord
who
will
do
his
own
work
look
not
at
man
who
is
in
the
work
nor
at
any
man
opposing
it
but
rest
in
the
will
of
the
lord
that
so
ye
may
be
furnished
with
patience
both
to
do
and
to
suffer
what
ye
shall
be
called
unto
that
your
end
in
all
things
may
be
his
praise
meet
often
together
take
heed
of
what
exalteth
itself
above
its
brother
but
keep
low
and
serve
one
another
in
love
laboring
thus
interrupted
only
by
persecution
stripes
and
imprisonment
he
finally
came
to
london
and
spoke
with
great
power
and
eloquence
in
the
meetings
of
friends
in
that
city
here
he
for
the
first
time
found
himself
surrounded
by
admiring
and
sympathizing
friends
he
saw
and
rejoiced
in
the
fruits
of
his
ministry
profane
and
drunken
cavaliers
intolerant
presbyters
and
blind
papists
owned
the
truths
which
he
uttered
and
counted
themselves
his
disciples
women
too
in
their
deep
trustfulness
and
admiring
reverence
sat
at
the
feet
of
the
eloquent
stranger
devout
believers
in
the
doctrine
of
the
inward
light
and
manifestation
of
god
in
the
heart
of
man
these
latter
at
length
thought
they
saw
such
unmistakable
evidences
of
the
true
life
in
james
nayler
that
they
felt
constrained
to
declare
that
christ
was
in
an
especial
manner
within
him
and
to
call
upon
all
to
recognize
in
reverent
adoration
this
new
incarnation
of
the
divine
and
heavenly
the
wild
enthusiasm
of
his
disciples
had
its
effect
on
the
teacher
weak
in
body
worn
with
sickness
fasting
stripes
and
and
naturally
credulous
and
imaginative
is
it
strange
that
in
some
measure
he
yielded
to
this
miserable
delusion
let
those
who
would
harshly
judge
him
or
ascribe
his
fall
to
the
peculiar
doctrines
of
his
sect
think
of
luther
engaged
in
personal
combat
with
the
devil
or
conversing
with
him
on
points
of
theology
in
his
or
of
bunyan
at
actual
fisticuffs
with
the
adversary
or
of
fleetwood
and
vane
and
harrison
and
making
preparations
for
an
earthly
reign
of
king
jesus
it
was
an
age
of
intense
religious
excitement
fanaticism
had
become
epidemic
cromwell
swayed
his
parliaments
by
revelations
and
scripture
phrases
in
the
painted
chamber
stout
generals
and
exterminated
the
irish
and
swept
dutch
navies
from
the
ocean
with
old
jewish
and
hymns
of
deborah
and
miriam
country
justices
charged
juries
in
hebraisms
and
cited
the
laws
of
palestine
oftener
than
those
of
england
poor
nayler
found
himself
in
the
very
midst
of
this
seething
and
confused
moral
maelstrom
he
struggled
against
it
for
a
time
but
human
nature
was
weak
he
became
to
use
his
own
words
bewildered
and
darkened
and
the
floods
went
over
him
leaving
london
with
some
of
his
more
zealous
followers
not
without
solemn
admonition
and
rebuke
from
francis
howgill
and
edward
burrough
who
at
that
period
were
regarded
as
the
most
eminent
and
gifted
of
the
society
ministers
he
bent
his
steps
towards
exeter
here
in
consequence
of
the
extravagance
of
his
language
and
that
of
his
disciples
he
was
arrested
and
thrown
into
prison
several
infatuated
women
surrounded
the
jail
declaring
that
christ
was
in
prison
and
on
being
admitted
to
see
him
knelt
down
and
kissed
his
feet
exclaiming
thy
name
shall
be
no
more
called
james
nayler
but
jesus
let
us
pity
him
and
them
they
full
of
grateful
and
extravagant
affection
for
the
man
whose
voice
had
called
them
away
from
worldly
vanities
to
what
they
regarded
as
eternal
realities
whose
hand
they
imagined
had
for
them
swung
back
the
pearl
gates
of
the
celestial
city
and
flooded
their
atmosphere
with
light
from
heaven
he
receiving
their
homage
not
as
offered
to
a
poor
weak
sinful
yorkshire
trooper
but
rather
to
the
hidden
man
of
the
heart
the
christ
within
him
with
that
deceiving
humility
which
is
but
another
name
for
spiritual
pride
mournful
yet
natural
such
as
is
still
in
greater
or
less
degree
manifested
between
the
catholic
enthusiast
and
her
confessor
such
as
the
careful
observer
may
at
times
take
note
of
in
our
protestant
revivals
and
camp
meetings
how
nayler
was
released
from
exeter
jail
does
not
appear
but
the
next
we
hear
of
him
is
at
bristol
in
the
fall
of
the
year
his
entrance
into
that
city
shows
the
progress
which
he
and
his
followers
had
made
in
the
interval
let
us
look
at
carlyle
description
of
it
a
procession
of
eight
persons
one
a
man
on
horseback
riding
single
the
others
men
and
women
partly
riding
double
partly
on
foot
in
the
muddiest
highway
in
the
wettest
weather
singing
all
but
the
single
rider
at
whose
bridle
walk
and
splash
two
women
holy
holy
lord
god
of
sabaoth
and
other
things
a
buzzing
tone
which
the
impartial
hearer
could
not
make
out
the
single
rider
is
a
male
figure
lank
hair
reaching
below
his
cheeks
hat
drawn
close
over
his
brows
rising
slightly
in
the
middle
of
abstruse
look
and
large
dangerous
jaws
strictly
closed
he
sings
not
sits
there
covered
and
is
sung
to
by
the
others
bare
amid
pouring
deluges
and
mud
that
the
rain
ran
in
at
their
necks
and
vented
it
at
their
hose
and
breeches
spectacle
to
the
west
of
england
and
posterity
singing
as
above
answering
no
question
except
in
song
from
bedminster
to
ratcliffgate
along
the
streets
to
the
high
cross
of
bristol
at
the
high
cross
they
are
laid
hold
of
by
the
authorities
turn
out
to
be
james
nayler
and
company
truly
a
more
pitiful
example
of
is
not
well
to
be
conceived
of
instead
of
taking
the
rational
view
of
it
however
and
mercifully
shutting
up
the
actors
in
a
the
authorities
of
that
day
conceiving
it
to
be
a
stupendous
blasphemy
and
themselves
avengers
in
the
matter
sent
nayler
under
strong
guard
up
to
london
to
be
examined
before
the
parliament
after
long
and
tedious
examinations
and
and
still
more
tedious
debates
some
portion
of
which
not
uninstructive
to
the
reader
may
still
be
found
in
diary
the
following
horrible
resolution
was
agreed
upon
that
james
nayler
be
set
in
the
pillory
with
his
head
in
the
pillory
in
the
palace
yard
westminster
during
the
space
of
two
hours
on
thursday
next
and
be
whipped
by
the
hangman
through
the
streets
from
westminster
to
the
old
exchange
and
there
likewise
be
set
in
the
pillory
with
his
head
in
the
pillory
for
the
space
of
two
hours
between
eleven
and
one
on
saturday
next
in
each
place
wearing
a
paper
containing
a
description
of
his
crimes
and
that
at
the
old
exchange
his
tongue
be
bored
through
with
a
hot
iron
and
that
he
be
there
stigmatized
on
the
forehead
with
the
letter
and
that
he
be
afterwards
sent
to
bristol
to
be
conveyed
into
and
through
the
said
city
on
horseback
with
his
face
backward
and
there
also
publicly
whipped
the
next
after
he
comes
thither
that
from
thence
he
be
committed
to
prison
in
bridewell
london
and
there
restrained
from
the
society
of
people
and
there
to
labor
hard
until
he
shall
be
released
by
parliament
and
during
that
time
be
debarred
the
use
of
pen
ink
and
paper
and
have
no
relief
except
what
he
earns
by
his
daily
labor
such
neither
more
nor
less
was
in
the
opinion
of
parliament
required
on
their
part
to
appease
the
divine
vengeance
the
sentence
was
pronounced
on
the
of
the
twelfth
month
the
entire
time
of
the
parliament
for
the
two
months
previous
having
been
occupied
with
the
case
the
presbyterians
in
that
body
were
ready
enough
to
make
the
most
of
an
offence
committed
by
one
who
had
been
an
independent
the
independents
to
escape
the
stigma
of
extenuating
the
crimes
of
one
of
their
quondam
brethren
vied
with
their
antagonists
in
shrieking
over
the
atrocity
of
nayler
blasphemy
and
in
urging
its
severe
punishment
here
and
there
among
both
classes
were
men
disposed
to
leniency
and
more
than
one
earnest
plea
was
made
for
merciful
dealing
with
a
man
whose
reason
was
evidently
unsettled
and
who
was
therefore
a
fitting
object
of
compassion
whose
crime
if
it
could
indeed
be
called
one
was
evidently
the
result
of
a
clouded
intellect
and
not
of
wilful
intention
of
evil
on
the
other
hand
many
were
in
favor
of
putting
him
to
death
as
a
sort
of
to
the
clergy
who
as
a
matter
of
course
were
greatly
scandalized
by
nayler
blasphemy
and
still
more
by
the
refusal
of
his
sect
to
pay
tithes
or
recognize
their
divine
commission
nayler
was
called
into
the
to
receive
his
sentence
i
do
not
know
mine
offence
he
said
mildly
you
shall
know
it
said
sir
thomas
widrington
by
your
sentence
when
the
sentence
was
read
he
attempted
to
speak
but
was
silenced
i
pray
god
said
nayler
that
he
may
not
lay
this
to
your
charge
the
next
day
the
of
the
twelfth
month
he
stood
in
the
pillory
two
hours
in
the
chill
winter
air
and
was
then
stripped
and
scourged
by
the
hangman
at
the
tail
of
a
cart
through
the
streets
three
hundred
and
ten
stripes
were
inflicted
his
back
and
arms
were
horribly
cut
and
mangled
and
his
feet
crushed
and
bruised
by
the
feet
of
horses
treading
on
him
in
the
crowd
he
bore
all
with
uncomplaining
patience
but
was
so
far
exhausted
by
his
sufferings
that
it
was
found
necessary
to
postpone
the
execution
of
the
residue
of
the
sentence
for
one
week
the
terrible
severity
of
his
sentence
and
his
meek
endurance
of
it
had
in
the
mean
time
powerfully
affected
many
of
the
humane
and
generous
of
all
classes
in
the
city
and
a
petition
for
the
remission
of
the
remaining
part
of
the
penalty
was
numerously
signed
and
presented
to
parliament
a
debate
ensued
upon
it
but
its
prayer
was
rejected
application
was
then
made
to
cromwell
who
addressed
a
letter
to
the
speaker
of
the
house
inquiring
into
the
affair
protesting
an
abhorrence
and
detestation
of
giving
or
occasioning
the
least
countenance
to
such
opinions
and
practices
as
were
imputed
to
nayler
yet
we
being
intrusted
in
the
present
government
on
behalf
of
the
people
of
these
nations
and
not
knowing
how
far
such
proceeding
entered
into
wholly
without
us
may
extend
in
the
consequence
of
it
do
hereby
desire
the
house
may
let
us
know
the
grounds
and
reasons
whereon
they
have
proceeded
from
this
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
protector
might
have
been
disposed
to
clemency
and
to
look
with
a
degree
of
charity
upon
the
weakness
and
errors
of
one
of
his
old
and
tried
soldiers
who
had
striven
like
a
brave
man
as
he
was
for
the
rights
and
liberties
of
englishmen
but
the
clergy
here
interposed
and
vehemently
in
the
name
of
god
and
his
church
demanded
that
the
executioner
should
finish
his
work
five
of
the
most
eminent
of
them
names
well
known
in
the
protectorate
caryl
manton
nye
griffith
and
reynolds
were
deputed
by
parliament
to
visit
the
mangled
prisoner
a
reasonable
request
was
made
that
some
impartial
person
might
be
present
that
justice
might
be
done
nayler
in
the
report
of
his
answers
this
was
refused
it
was
however
agreed
that
the
conversation
should
be
written
down
and
a
copy
of
it
left
with
the
jailer
he
was
asked
if
he
was
sorry
for
his
blasphemies
he
said
he
did
not
know
to
what
blasphemies
they
alluded
that
he
did
believe
in
jesus
christ
that
he
had
taken
up
his
dwelling
in
his
own
heart
and
for
the
testimony
of
him
he
now
suffered
i
believe
said
one
of
the
ministers
in
a
christ
who
was
never
in
any
man
heart
i
know
no
such
christ
rejoined
the
prisoner
the
christ
i
witness
to
fills
heaven
and
earth
and
dwells
in
the
hearts
of
all
true
believers
on
being
asked
why
he
allowed
the
women
to
adore
and
worship
him
he
said
he
denied
bowing
to
the
creature
but
if
they
beheld
the
power
of
christ
wherever
it
was
and
bowed
to
it
he
could
not
resist
it
or
say
aught
against
it
after
some
further
parley
the
reverend
visitors
grew
angry
threw
the
written
record
of
the
conversation
in
the
fire
and
left
the
prison
to
report
the
prisoner
incorrigible
on
the
of
the
month
he
was
again
led
out
of
his
cell
and
placed
upon
the
pillory
thousands
of
citizens
were
gathered
around
many
of
them
earnestly
protesting
against
the
extreme
cruelty
of
his
punishment
robert
rich
an
influential
and
honorable
merchant
followed
him
up
to
the
pillory
with
expressions
of
great
sympathy
and
held
him
by
the
hand
while
the
iron
was
pressed
through
his
tongue
and
the
brand
was
placed
on
his
forehead
he
was
next
sent
to
bristol
and
publicly
whipped
through
the
principal
streets
of
that
city
and
again
brought
back
to
the
bridewell
prison
where
he
remained
about
two
years
shut
out
from
all
intercourse
with
his
at
the
expiration
of
this
period
he
was
released
by
order
of
parliament
in
the
solitude
of
his
cell
the
angel
of
patience
had
been
with
him
through
the
cloud
which
had
so
long
rested
over
him
the
clear
light
of
truth
shone
in
upon
his
spirit
the
weltering
chaos
of
a
disordered
intellect
settled
into
the
calm
peace
of
a
reconciliation
with
god
and
man
his
first
act
on
leaving
prison
was
to
visit
bristol
the
scene
of
his
melancholy
fall
there
he
publicly
confessed
his
errors
in
the
eloquent
earnestness
of
a
contrite
spirit
humbled
in
view
of
the
past
yet
full
of
thanksgiving
and
praise
for
the
great
boon
of
forgiveness
a
writer
who
was
present
says
the
assembly
was
tendered
and
broken
into
tears
there
were
few
dry
eyes
and
many
were
bowed
in
their
minds
in
a
paper
which
he
published
soon
after
he
acknowledges
his
lamentable
delusion
condemned
forever
he
says
be
all
those
false
worships
with
which
any
have
idolized
my
person
in
that
night
of
my
temptation
when
the
power
of
darkness
was
above
rue
all
that
did
in
any
way
tend
to
dishonor
the
lord
or
draw
the
minds
of
any
from
the
measure
of
christ
jesus
in
themselves
to
look
at
flesh
which
is
as
grass
or
to
ascribe
that
to
the
visible
which
belongs
to
him
darkness
came
over
me
through
want
of
watchfulness
and
obedience
to
the
pure
eye
of
god
i
was
taken
captive
from
the
true
light
i
was
walking
in
the
night
as
a
wandering
bird
fit
for
a
prey
and
if
the
lord
of
all
my
mercies
had
not
rescued
me
i
had
perished
for
i
was
as
one
appointed
to
death
and
destruction
and
there
was
none
to
deliver
me
it
is
in
my
heart
to
confess
to
god
and
before
men
my
folly
and
offence
in
that
day
yet
there
were
many
things
formed
against
me
in
that
day
to
take
away
my
life
and
bring
scandal
upon
the
truth
of
which
i
was
not
guilty
at
all
the
provocation
of
that
time
of
temptation
was
exceeding
great
against
the
lord
yet
he
left
me
not
for
when
darkness
was
above
and
the
adversary
so
prevailed
that
all
things
were
turned
and
perverted
against
my
right
seeing
hearing
or
understanding
only
a
secret
hope
and
faith
i
had
in
my
god
whom
i
had
served
that
he
would
bring
me
through
it
and
to
the
end
of
it
and
that
i
should
again
see
the
day
of
my
redemption
from
under
it
all
this
quieted
my
soul
in
its
greatest
tribulation
he
concludes
his
confession
with
these
words
he
who
hath
saved
my
soul
from
death
who
hath
lifted
my
feet
up
out
of
the
pit
even
to
him
be
glory
forever
and
let
every
troubled
soul
trust
in
him
for
his
mercy
endureth
forever
among
his
papers
written
soon
after
his
release
is
a
remarkable
prayer
or
rather
thanksgiving
the
limit
i
have
prescribed
to
myself
will
only
allow
me
to
copy
an
extract
it
is
in
my
heart
to
praise
thee
o
my
god
let
me
never
forget
thee
what
thou
hast
been
to
me
in
the
night
by
thy
presence
in
my
hour
of
trial
when
i
was
beset
in
darkness
when
i
was
cast
out
as
a
wandering
bird
when
i
was
assaulted
with
strong
temptations
then
thy
presence
in
secret
did
preserve
me
and
in
a
low
state
i
felt
thee
near
me
when
my
way
was
through
the
sea
when
i
passed
under
the
mountains
there
wast
thou
present
with
me
when
the
weight
of
the
hills
was
upon
me
thou
upheldest
me
thou
didst
fight
on
my
part
when
i
wrestled
with
death
when
darkness
would
have
shut
me
up
thy
light
shone
about
me
when
my
work
was
in
the
furnace
and
i
passed
through
the
fire
by
thee
i
was
not
consumed
when
i
beheld
the
dreadful
visions
and
was
among
the
fiery
spirits
thy
faith
staid
me
else
through
fear
i
had
fallen
i
saw
thee
and
believed
so
that
the
enemy
could
not
prevail
after
speaking
of
his
humiliation
and
sufferings
which
divine
mercy
had
overruled
for
his
spiritual
good
he
thus
concludes
thou
didst
lift
me
out
from
the
pit
and
set
me
forth
in
the
sight
of
my
enemies
thou
proclaimedst
liberty
to
the
captive
thou
calledst
my
acquaintances
near
me
they
to
whom
i
had
been
a
wonder
looked
upon
me
and
in
thy
love
i
obtained
favor
with
those
who
had
deserted
me
then
did
gladness
swallow
up
sorrow
and
i
forsook
my
troubles
and
i
said
how
good
is
it
that
man
be
proved
in
the
night
that
he
may
know
his
folly
that
every
mouth
may
become
silent
until
thou
makest
man
known
unto
himself
and
has
slain
the
boaster
and
shown
him
the
vanity
which
vexeth
thy
spirit
all
honor
to
the
quakers
of
that
day
that
at
the
risk
of
misrepresentation
and
calumny
they
received
back
to
their
communion
their
greatly
erring
but
deeply
repentant
brother
his
life
ever
after
was
one
of
and
jealous
watchfulness
over
himself
blameless
and
beautiful
in
its
humility
and
lowly
charity
thomas
ellwood
in
his
autobiography
for
the
year
mentions
nayler
whom
he
met
in
company
with
edward
burrough
at
the
house
of
friend
pennington
ellwood
father
held
a
discourse
with
the
two
quakers
on
their
doctrine
of
free
and
universal
grace
james
nailer
says
ellwood
handled
the
subject
with
so
much
perspicuity
and
clear
demonstration
that
his
reasoning
seemed
to
be
irresistible
as
for
edward
burrough
he
was
a
brisk
young
man
of
a
ready
tongue
and
might
have
been
for
aught
i
then
knew
a
scholar
which
made
me
less
admire
his
way
of
reasoning
but
what
dropt
from
james
nailer
had
the
greater
force
upon
me
because
he
lookt
like
a
simple
countryman
having
the
appearance
of
an
husbandman
or
shepherd
in
the
latter
part
of
the
eighth
month
he
left
london
on
foot
to
visit
his
wife
and
children
in
wakefield
as
he
journeyed
on
the
sense
of
a
solemn
change
about
to
take
place
seemed
with
him
the
shadow
of
the
eternal
world
fell
over
him
as
he
passed
through
huntingdon
a
friend
who
saw
him
describes
him
as
in
an
awful
and
weighty
frame
of
mind
as
if
he
had
been
redeemed
from
earth
and
a
stranger
on
it
seeking
a
better
home
and
inheritance
a
few
miles
beyond
the
town
he
was
found
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
very
ill
and
was
taken
to
the
house
of
a
friend
who
lived
not
far
distant
he
died
shortly
after
expressing
his
gratitude
for
the
kindness
of
his
attendants
and
invoking
blessings
upon
them
about
two
hours
before
his
death
he
spoke
to
the
friend
at
his
bedside
these
remarkable
words
solemn
as
eternity
and
beautiful
as
the
love
which
fills
it
there
is
a
spirit
which
i
feel
which
delights
to
do
no
evil
nor
to
avenge
any
wrong
but
delights
to
endure
all
things
in
hope
to
enjoy
its
own
in
the
end
its
hope
is
to
outlive
all
wrath
and
contention
and
to
weary
out
all
exultation
and
cruelty
or
whatever
is
of
a
nature
contrary
to
itself
it
sees
to
the
end
of
all
temptations
as
it
bears
no
evil
in
itself
so
it
conceives
none
in
thought
to
any
other
if
it
be
betrayed
it
bears
it
for
its
ground
and
spring
is
the
mercy
and
forgiveness
of
god
its
crown
is
meekness
its
life
is
everlasting
love
unfeigned
it
takes
its
kingdom
with
entreaty
and
not
with
contention
and
keeps
it
by
lowliness
of
mind
in
god
alone
it
can
rejoice
though
none
else
regard
it
or
can
own
its
life
it
is
conceived
in
sorrow
and
brought
forth
with
none
to
pity
it
nor
doth
it
murmur
at
grief
and
oppression
it
never
rejoiceth
but
through
sufferings
for
with
the
world
joy
it
is
murdered
i
found
it
alone
being
forsaken
i
have
fellowship
therein
with
them
who
lived
in
dens
and
desolate
places
of
the
earth
who
through
death
obtained
resurrection
and
eternal
holy
life
so
died

wrong
and
violence
and
temptation
and
sorrow
and
could
reach
him
no
more
and
in
taking
leave
of
him
let
us
say
with
old
joseph
wyeth
where
he
touches
upon
this
case
in
his
let
none
insult
but
take
heed
lest
they
also
in
the
hour
of
their
temptation
do
fall
away
andrew
marvell
they
who
with
a
good
conscience
and
an
upright
heart
do
their
civil
duties
in
the
sight
of
god
and
in
their
several
places
to
resist
tyranny
and
the
violence
of
superstition
banded
both
against
them
will
never
seek
to
be
forgiven
that
which
may
justly
be
attributed
to
their
immortal
praise
answer
to
eikon
basilike
among
the
great
names
which
adorned
the
protectorate
that
period
of
intense
mental
activity
when
political
and
religious
rights
and
duties
were
thoroughly
discussed
by
strong
and
earnest
statesmen
and
theologians
that
of
andrew
marvell
the
friend
of
milton
and
latin
secretary
of
cromwell
deserves
honorable
mention
the
magnificent
prose
of
milton
long
neglected
is
now
perhaps
as
frequently
read
as
his
great
epic
but
the
writings
of
his
friend
and
fellow
secretary
devoted
like
his
own
to
the
cause
of
freedom
and
the
rights
of
the
people
are
scarcely
known
to
the
present
generation
it
is
true
that
political
pamphlets
were
less
elaborate
and
profound
than
those
of
the
author
of
the
glorious
of
unlicensed
he
was
light
playful
witty
and
sarcastic
he
lacked
the
stern
dignity
the
terrible
invective
the
bitter
scorn
the
crushing
annihilating
retort
the
grand
and
solemn
eloquence
and
the
devout
appeals
which
render
immortal
the
controversial
works
of
milton
but
he
too
has
left
his
on
his
age
he
too
has
written
for
posterity
that
which
they
will
not
willingly
let
die
as
one
of
the
inflexible
defenders
of
english
liberty
sowers
of
the
seed
the
fruits
of
which
we
are
now
reaping
he
has
a
higher
claim
on
the
kind
regards
of
this
generation
than
his
merits
as
a
poet
by
no
means
inconsiderable
would
warrant
andrew
marvell
was
born
in
in
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
entered
trinity
college
whence
he
was
enticed
by
the
jesuits
then
actively
seeking
proselytes
after
remaining
with
them
a
short
time
his
father
found
him
and
brought
him
back
to
his
studies
on
leaving
college
he
travelled
on
the
continent
at
rome
he
wrote
his
first
satire
a
humorous
critique
upon
richard
flecknoe
an
english
jesuit
and
verse
writer
whose
lines
on
silence
charles
lamb
quotes
in
one
of
his
essays
it
is
supposed
that
he
made
his
first
acquaintance
with
milton
in
italy
at
paris
he
made
the
abbot
de
manihan
the
subject
of
another
satire
the
abbot
pretended
to
skill
in
the
arts
of
magic
and
used
to
prognosticate
the
fortunes
of
people
from
the
character
of
their
handwriting
at
what
period
he
returned
from
his
travels
we
are
not
aware
it
is
stated
by
some
of
his
biographers
that
he
was
sent
as
secretary
of
a
turkish
mission
in
he
was
appointed
the
tutor
of
cromwell
nephew
and
four
years
after
doubtless
through
the
instrumentality
of
his
friend
milton
he
received
the
honorable
appointment
of
latin
secretary
of
the
commonwealth
in
he
was
selected
by
his
townsmen
of
hull
to
represent
them
in
parliament
in
this
service
he
continued
until
when
notwithstanding
his
sturdy
republican
principles
he
was
appointed
secretary
to
the
russian
embassy
on
his
return
in
he
was
again
elected
to
parliament
and
continued
in
the
public
service
until
the
prorogation
of
the
parliament
of
the
boldness
the
uncompromising
integrity
and
irreproachable
consistency
of
marvell
as
a
statesman
have
secured
for
him
the
honorable
appellation
of
the
british
aristides
unlike
too
many
of
his
old
associates
under
the
protectorate
he
did
not
change
with
the
times
he
was
a
republican
in
cromwell
day
and
neither
threats
of
assassination
nor
flatteries
nor
proffered
bribes
could
make
him
anything
else
in
that
of
charles
ii
he
advocated
the
rights
of
the
people
at
a
time
when
patriotism
was
regarded
as
ridiculous
folly
when
a
general
corruption
spreading
downwards
from
a
lewd
and
abominable
court
had
made
legislation
a
mere
scramble
for
place
and
emolument
english
history
presents
no
period
so
disgraceful
as
the
restoration
to
use
the
words
of
macaulay
it
was
a
day
of
servitude
without
loyalty
and
sensuality
without
love
of
dwarfish
talents
and
gigantic
vices
the
paradise
of
cold
hearts
and
narrow
minds
the
golden
age
of
the
coward
the
bigot
and
the
slave
the
principles
of
liberty
were
the
scoff
of
every
grinning
courtier
and
the
anathema
maranatha
of
every
fawning
dean
it
is
the
peculiar
merit
of
milton
and
marvell
that
in
such
an
age
they
held
fast
their
integrity
standing
up
in
glorious
contrast
with
clerical
apostates
and
traitors
to
the
cause
of
england
liberty
in
the
discharge
of
his
duties
as
a
statesman
marvell
was
as
punctual
and
conscientious
as
our
own
venerable
apostle
of
freedom
john
quincy
adams
he
corresponded
every
post
with
his
constituents
keeping
them
fully
apprised
of
all
that
transpired
at
court
or
in
parliament
he
spoke
but
seldom
but
his
great
personal
influence
was
exerted
privately
upon
the
members
of
the
commons
as
well
as
upon
the
peers
his
wit
accomplished
manners
and
literary
eminence
made
him
a
favorite
at
the
court
itself
the
voluptuous
and
careless
monarch
laughed
over
the
biting
satire
of
the
republican
poet
and
heartily
enjoyed
his
lively
conversation
it
is
said
that
numerous
advances
were
made
to
him
by
the
courtiers
of
charles
but
he
was
found
to
be
incorruptible
the
personal
compliments
of
the
king
the
encomiums
of
rochester
the
smiles
and
flatteries
of
the
frail
but
fair
and
ladies
of
the
court
nay
even
the
golden
offers
of
the
king
treasurer
who
climbing
with
difficulty
to
his
obscure
retreat
on
an
upper
floor
of
a
court
in
the
strand
laid
a
tempting
bribe
of
before
him
on
the
very
day
when
he
had
been
compelled
to
borrow
a
guinea
were
all
lost
upon
the
inflexible
patriot
he
stood
up
manfully
in
an
age
of
persecution
for
religious
liberty
opposed
the
oppressive
excise
and
demanded
frequent
parliaments
and
a
fair
representation
of
the
people
in
marvell
engaged
in
a
controversy
with
the
famous
parker
who
had
taken
the
lead
in
urging
the
persecution
of
conformists
in
one
of
the
works
of
this
arrogant
divine
he
says
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
peace
and
government
of
the
world
that
the
supreme
magistrate
should
be
vested
with
power
to
govern
and
conduct
the
consciences
of
subjects
in
affairs
of
religion
princes
may
with
less
hazard
give
liberty
to
men
vices
and
debaucheries
than
to
their
consciences
and
speaking
of
the
various
sects
of
he
counsels
princes
and
legislators
that
tenderness
and
indulgence
to
such
men
is
to
nourish
vipers
in
their
own
bowels
and
the
most
sottish
neglect
of
our
quiet
and
security
marvell
replied
to
him
in
a
severely
satirical
pamphlet
which
provoked
a
reply
from
the
doctor
marvell
rejoined
with
a
rare
combination
of
wit
and
argument
the
effect
of
his
sarcasm
on
the
doctor
and
his
supporters
may
be
inferred
from
an
anonymous
note
sent
him
in
which
the
writer
threatens
by
the
eternal
god
to
cut
his
throat
if
he
uttered
any
more
libels
upon
parker
bishop
burnet
remarks
that
marvell
writ
in
a
burlesque
strain
but
with
so
peculiar
and
so
entertaining
a
conduct
from
the
king
down
to
the
tradesman
his
books
were
read
with
great
pleasure
and
not
only
humbled
parker
but
his
whole
party
for
marvell
had
all
the
wits
on
his
side
the
bishop
further
remarks
that
marvell
satire
gave
occasion
to
the
only
piece
of
modesty
with
which
parker
was
ever
charged
namely
of
withdrawing
from
town
and
not
importuning
the
press
for
some
years
since
even
a
face
of
brass
must
grow
red
when
it
is
burnt
as
his
has
been
dean
swift
in
commenting
upon
the
usual
fate
of
controversial
pamphlets
which
seldom
live
beyond
their
generation
says
there
is
indeed
an
exception
when
a
great
genius
undertakes
to
expose
a
foolish
piece
so
we
still
read
marvell
answer
to
parker
with
pleasure
though
the
book
it
answers
be
sunk
long
ago
perhaps
in
the
entire
compass
of
our
language
there
is
not
to
be
found
a
finer
piece
of
satirical
writing
than
marvell
famous
parody
of
the
speeches
of
charles
in
which
the
private
vices
and
public
inconsistencies
of
the
king
and
his
gross
violations
of
his
pledges
on
coming
to
the
throne
are
exposed
with
the
keenest
wit
and
the
most
irony
charles
himself
although
doubtless
annoyed
by
it
could
not
refrain
from
joining
in
the
mirth
which
it
excited
at
his
expense
the
friendship
between
marvell
and
milton
remained
firm
and
unbroken
to
the
last
the
former
exerted
himself
to
save
his
illustrious
friend
from
persecution
and
omitted
no
opportunity
to
defend
him
as
a
politician
and
to
eulogize
him
as
a
poet
in
he
presented
to
cromwell
noble
tract
in
of
the
people
of
and
in
writing
to
the
author
says
of
the
work
when
i
consider
how
equally
it
teems
and
rises
with
so
many
figures
it
seems
to
me
a
trajan
column
in
whose
winding
ascent
we
see
embossed
the
several
monuments
of
your
learned
victories
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
appreciate
and
to
commend
it
in
some
admirable
lines
one
couplet
is
exceedingly
beautiful
in
its
reference
to
the
author
blindness
just
heaven
thee
like
tiresias
to
requite
rewards
with
prophecy
thy
loss
of
sight
his
poems
written
in
the
snatched
leisure
of
an
active
political
life
bear
marks
of
haste
and
are
very
unequal
in
the
midst
of
passages
of
pastoral
description
worthy
of
milton
himself
feeble
lines
and
hackneyed
phrases
occur
his
lamenting
the
death
of
her
is
a
finished
and
elaborate
piece
full
of
grace
and
tenderness
in
a
will
be
remembered
by
the
quotations
of
that
exquisite
critic
charles

pleasant

wholesome
hours
be

of

oh
what
a

is
to

a
little
poem
of
marvell
which
he
calls
eyes
and
tears
has
the
following
passages
how
wisely
nature
did
agree
with
the
same
eyes
to
weep
and
see
that
having
viewed
the
object
vain
they
might
be
ready
to
complain
and
since
the
sight
in
a
false
angle
takes
each
height
these
tears
which
better
measure
all
like
watery
lines
and
plummets
fall
happy
are
they
whom
grief
doth
bless
that
weep
the
more
and
see
the
less
and
to
preserve
their
sight
more
true
bathe
still
their

in
their

so
magdalen
in

desire
drenched
in

the

dear
not
as
a

a
tear
and

the
bermuda

has
some
happy
lines
as
the
following
he
hangs
in
shade
the
orange
bright
like
golden
lamps
in
a
green
night
or
this
which
doubtless
suggested
a
couplet
in
moore
boat
and
all
the
way
to
guide
the
chime
with
falling
oars
they
kept
the
time
his
facetious
and
burlesque
poetry
was
much
admired
in
his
day
but
a
great
portion
of
it
referred
to
persons
and
events
no
longer
of
general
interest
the
satire
on
holland
is
an
exception
there
is
nothing
in
its
way
superior
to
it
in
our
language
many
of
his
best
pieces
were
originally
written
in
latin
and
afterwards
translated
by
himself
there
is
a
splendid
ode
to
cromwell
a
worthy
companion
of
milton
glorious
sonnet
which
is
not
generally
known
and
which
we
transfer
entire
to
our
pages
its
simple
dignity
and
the
melodious
flow
of
its
versification
commend
themselves
more
to
our
feelings
than
its
eulogy
of
war
it
is
energetic
and
impassioned
and
probably
affords
a
better
idea
of
the
author
as
an
actor
in
the
stirring
drama
of
his
time
than
the
soft
lydian
airs
of
the
poems
that
we
have
quoted
an
horatian
ode
upon
cromwell
return
from
ireland
the
forward
youth
that
would
appear
must
now
forsake
his
muses
dear
nor
in
the
shadows
sing
his
numbers
languishing
is
time
to
leave
the
books
in
dust
and
oil
the
unused
armor
rust
removing
from
the
wall
the
corslet
of
the
hall
so
restless
cromwell
could
not
cease
in
the
inglorious
arts
of
peace
but
through
adventurous
war
urged
his
active
star
and
like
the
lightning
first
breaking
the
clouds
wherein
it
nurst
did
thorough
his
own
side
his
fiery
way
divide
for
is
all
one
to
courage
high
the
emulous
or
enemy
and
with
such
to
enclose
is
more
than
to
oppose
then
burning
through
the
air
he
went
and
palaces
and
temples
rent
and
caesar
head
at
last
did
through
his
laurels
blast
is
madness
to
resist
or
blame
the
face
of
angry
heaven
flame
and
if
we
would
speak
true
much
to
the
man
is
due
who
from
his
private
gardens
where
he
lived
reserved
and
austere
as
if
his
highest
plot
to
plant
the
bergamot
could
by
industrious
valor
climb
to
ruin
the
great
work
of
time
and
cast
the
kingdoms
old
into
another
mould
though
justice
against
fate
complain
and
plead
the
ancient
rights
in
vain
but
those
do
hold
or
break
as
men
are
strong
or
weak
nature
that
hateth
emptiness
allows
of
penetration
less
and
therefore
must
make
room
where
greater
spirits
come
what
field
of
all
the
civil
war
where
his
were
not
the
deepest
scar
and
hampton
shows
what
part
he
had
of
wiser
art
where
twining
subtle
fears
with
hope
he
wove
a
net
of
such
a
scope
that
charles
himself
might
chase
to
carisbrook
narrow
case
that
hence
the
royal
actor
borne
the
tragic
scaffold
might
adorn
while
round
the
armed
bands
did
clap
their
bloody
hands
he
nothing
common
did
or
mean
upon
that
memorable
scene
but
with
his
keener
eye
the
axe
edge
did
try
nor
called
the
gods
with
vulgar
spite
to
vindicate
his
helpless
right
but
bowed
his
comely
head
down
as
upon
a
bed
this
was
that
memorable
hour
which
first
assured
the
forced
power
so
when
they
did
design
the
capitol
first
line
a
bleeding
head
where
they
begun
did
fright
the
architects
to
run
and
yet
in
that
the
state
foresaw
its
happy
fate
and
now
the
irish
are
ashamed
to
see
themselves
in
one
year
tamed
so
much
one
man
can
do
that
does
best
act
and
know
they
can
affirm
his
praises
best
and
have
though
overcome
confest
how
good
he
is
how
just
and
fit
for
highest
trust
nor
yet
grown
stiffer
by
command
but
still
in
the
republic
hand
how
fit
he
is
to
sway
that
can
so
well
obey

his

his
sword

at

when

falls
heavy
from

for

england
as
ascetics
enemies
of
the
fine
arts
and
polite
literature
the
works
of
milton
and
marvell
the
poem
of
harrington
and
the
admirable
discourses
of
algernon
sydney
are
a
sufficient
answer
to
this
accusation
to
none
has
it
less
application
than
to
the
subject
of
our
sketch
he
was
a
genial
warmhearted
man
an
elegant
scholar
a
finished
gentleman
at
home
and
the
life
of
every
circle
which
he
entered
whether
that
of
the
gay
court
of
charles
amidst
such
men
as
rochester
and
or
that
of
the
republican
philosophers
who
assembled
at
miles
coffee
house
where
he
discussed
plans
of
a
free
representative
government
with
the
author
of
oceana
and
cyriack
skinner
that
friend
of
milton
whom
the
bard
has
immortalized
in
the
sonnet
which
so
pathetically
yet
heroically
alludes
to
his
own
blindness
men
of
all
parties
enjoyed
his
wit
and
graceful
conversation
his
personal
appearance
was
altogether
in
his
favor
a
clear
dark
spanish
complexion
long
hair
of
jetty
blackness
falling
in
graceful
wreaths
to
his
shoulders
dark
eyes
full
of
expression
and
fire
a
finely
chiselled
chin
and
a
mouth
whose
soft
voluptuousness
scarcely
gave
token
of
the
steady
purpose
and
firm
will
of
the
inflexible
statesman
these
added
to
the
prestige
of
his
genius
and
the
respect
which
a
lofty
patriotism
extorts
even
from
those
who
would
fain
corrupt
and
bribe
it
gave
him
a
ready
passport
to
the
fashionable
society
of
the
metropolis
he
was
one
of
the
few
who
mingled
in
that
society
and
escaped
its
contamination
and
who
amidst
the
wavering
days
of
sin
kept
himself
icy
chaste
and
pure
the
tone
and
temper
of
his
mind
may
be
most
fitly
expressed
in
his
own
paraphrase
of
horace
climb
at
court
for
me
that
will
tottering
favor
pinnacle
all
i
seek
is
to
lie
still
settled
in
some
secret
nest
in
calm
leisure
let
me
rest
and
far
off
the
public
stage
pass
away
my
silent
age
thus
when
without
noise
unknown
i
have
lived
out
all
my
span
i
shall
die
without
a
groan
an
old
honest
countryman
who
exposed
to
other
eyes
into
his
own
heart
pries
death
to
him
a
strange
surprise
he
died
suddenly
in
while
in
attendance
at
a
popular
meeting
of
his
old
constituents
at
hull
his
health
had
previously
been
remarkably
good
and
it
was
supposed
by
many
that
he
was
poisoned
by
some
of
his
political
or
clerical
enemies
his
monument
erected
by
his
grateful
constituency
bears
the
following
inscription
near
this
place
lyeth
the
body
of
andrew
marvell
a
man
so
endowed
by
nature
so
improved
by
education
study
and
travel
so
consummated
by
experience
that
joining
the
peculiar
graces
of
wit
and
learning
with
a
singular
penetration
and
strength
of
judgment
and
exercising
all
these
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
with
an
unutterable
steadiness
in
the
ways
of
virtue
he
became
the
ornament
and
example
of
his
age
beloved
by
good
men
feared
by
bad
admired
by
all
though
imitated
by
few
and
scarce
paralleled
by
any
but
a
tombstone
can
neither
contain
his
character
nor
is
marble
necessary
to
transmit
it
to
posterity
it
is
engraved
in
the
minds
of
this
generation
and
will
be
always
legible
in
his
inimitable
writings
nevertheless
he
having
served
twenty
years
successfully
in
parliament
and
that
with
such
wisdom
dexterity
and
courage
as
becomes
a
true
patriot
the
town
of
from
whence
he
was
deputed
to
that
assembly
lamenting
in
his
death
the
public
loss
have
erected
this
monument
of
their
grief
and
their
gratitude
thus
lived
and
died
andrew
marvell
his
memory
is
the
inheritance
of
americans
as
well
as
englishmen
his
example
commends
itself
in
an
especial
manner
to
the
legislators
of
our
republic
integrity
and
fidelity
to
principle
are
as
greatly
needed
at
this
time
in
our
halls
of
congress
as
in
the
parliaments
of
the
restoration
men
are
required
who
can
feel
with
milton
that
it
is
high
honor
done
them
from
god
and
a
special
mark
of
his
favor
to
have
been
selected
to
stand
upright
and
steadfast
in
his
cause
dignified
with
the
defence
of
truth
and
public
liberty
john
roberts
thomas
carlyle
in
his
history
of
the
stout
and
sagacious
monk
of
edmunds
has
given
us
a
fine
picture
of
the
actual
life
of
englishmen
in
the
middle
centuries
the
dim
of
the
somewhat
apocryphal
jocelin
of
brakelond
becomes
in
his
hands
a
huge
shining
over
the
dark
ages
like
the
cressets
over
pandemonium
proving
as
he
says
in
his
own
quaint
way
that
england
in
the
year
was
no
dreamland
but
a
green
solid
place
which
grew
corn
and
several
other
things
the
sun
shone
on
it
the
vicissitudes
of
seasons
and
human
fortunes
were
there
cloth
was
woven
ditches
dug
fallow
fields
ploughed
and
houses
built
and
if
as
the
writer
just
quoted
insists
it
is
a
matter
of
no
small
importance
to
make
it
credible
to
the
present
generation
that
the
past
is
not
a
confused
dream
of
thrones
and
fields
creeds
and
constitutions
but
a
reality
substantial
as
hearth
and
home
and
and
death
could
make
it
we
shall
not
wholly
waste
our
time
and
that
of
our
readers
in
inviting
them
to
look
with
us
at
the
rural
life
of
england
two
centuries
ago
through
the
eyes
of

roberts
and
his
worthy

memoirs
of
john
roberts
alias
haywood

his
son
daniel
the
second
edition
printed
verbatim
from
the
original
one
with
its
picturesque
array
of
italics
and
capital
letters
is
to
be
found
only
in
a
few
of
our
old
quaker
libraries
it
opens
with
some
account
of
the
family
the
father
of
the
elder
roberts
lived
reputably
on
a
little
estate
of
his
own
and
it
is
mentioned
as
noteworthy
that
he
married
a
sister
of
a
gentleman
in
the
commission
of
the
peace
coming
of
age
about
the
beginning
of
the
civil
wars
john
and
one
of
his
young
neighbors
enlisted
in
the
service
of
parliament
hearing
that
cirencester
had
been
taken
by
the
king
forces
they
obtained
leave
of
absence
to
visit
their
friends
for
whose
safety
they
naturally
felt
solicitous
the
following
account
of
the
reception
they
met
with
from
the
drunken
and
ferocious
troopers
of
charles
the
bravos
of
alsatia
and
the
pages
of
whitehall
throws
a
ghastly
light
upon
the
horrors
of
civil
war
as
they
were
passing
by
cirencester
they
were
discovered
and
pursued
by
two
soldiers
of
the
king
party
then
in
possession
of
the
town
seeing
themselves
pursued
they
quitted
their
horses
and
took
to
their
heels
but
by
reason
of
their
accoutrements
could
make
little
speed
they
came
up
with
my
father
first
and
though
he
begged
for
quarter
none
they
would
give
him
but
laid
on
him
with
their
swords
cutting
and
slashing
his
hands
and
arms
which
he
held
up
to
save
his
head
as
the
marks
upon
them
did
long
after
testify
at
length
it
pleased
the
almighty
to
put
it
into
his
mind
to
fall
down
on
his
face
which
he
did
hereupon
the
soldiers
being
on
horseback
cried
to
each
other
and
cut
his
but
neither
of
them
did
yet
continued
to
strike
and
prick
him
about
the
jaws
till
they
thought
him
dead
then
they
left
him
and
pursued
his
neighbor
whom
they
presently
overtook
and
killed
soon
after
they
had
left
my
father
it
was
said
in
his
heart
and
flee
for
thy
which
call
he
obeyed
and
starting
upon
his
feet
his
enemies
espied
him
in
motion
and
pursued
him
again
he
ran
down
a
steep
hill
and
through
a
river
which
ran
at
the
bottom
of
it
though
with
exceeding
difficulty
his
boots
filling
with
water
and
his
wounds
bleeding
very
much
they
followed
him
to
the
top
of
the
hill
but
seeing
he
had
got
over
pursued
him
no
farther
the
surgeon
who
attended
him
was
a
royalist
and
bluntly
told
his
bleeding
patient
that
if
he
had
met
him
in
the
street
he
would
have
killed
him
himself
but
now
he
was
willing
to
cure
him
on
his
recovery
young
roberts
again
entered
the
army
and
continued
in
it
until
the
overthrow
of
the
monarchy
on
his
return
he
married
lydia
tindall
of
the
denomination
of
puritans
a
majestic
figure
rises
before
us
on
reading
the
statement
that
sir
matthew
hale
afterwards
lord
chief
justice
of
england
the
irreproachable
jurist
and
judicial
saint
was
his
wife
kinsman
and
drew
her
marriage
settlement
no
stronger
testimony
to
the
morality
and
austere
virtue
of
the
puritan
yeomanry
of
england
can
be
adduced
than
the
fact
that
of
the
fifty
thousand
soldiers
who
were
discharged
on
the
accession
of
charles
and
left
to
shift
for
themselves
comparatively
few
if
any
became
chargeable
to
their
parishes
although
at
that
very
time
one
out
of
six
of
the
english
population
were
unable
to
support
themselves
they
carried
into
their
and
workshops
the
strict
habits
of
cromwell
discipline
and
in
toiling
to
repair
their
wasted
fortunes
they
manifested
the
same
heroic
fortitude
and
which
in
war
had
made
them
such
formidable
and
efficient
soldiers
of
the
lord
with
few
exceptions
they
remained
steadfast
in
their
uncompromising
conformity
abhorring
prelacy
and
popery
and
entertaining
no
very
orthodox
notions
with
respect
to
the
divine
right
of
kings
from
them
the
quakers
drew
their
most
zealous
champions
men
who
in
renouncing
the
carnal
weapons
of
their
old
service
found
employment
for
habitual
combativeness
in
hot
and
wordy
sectarian
warfare
to
this
day
the
vocabulary
of
quakerism
abounds
in
the
military
phrases
and
figures
which
were
in
use
in
the
commonwealth
time
their
old
force
and
significance
are
now
in
a
great
measure
lost
but
one
can
well
imagine
that
in
the
assemblies
of
the
primitive
quakers
such
stirring
and
warlike
tropes
even
when
employed
in
enforcing
or
illustrating
the
doctrines
of
peace
must
have
made
many
a
stout
heart
to
beat
quicker
tinder
its
drab
coloring
with
recollections
of
naseby
and
preston
transporting
many
a
listener
from
the
benches
of
his
place
of
worship
to
the
ranks
of
ireton
and
lambert
and
causing
him
to
hear
in
the
place
of
the
solemn
and
nasal
tones
of
the
preacher
the
blast
of
rupert
bugles
and
the
answering
shout
of
cromwell
pikemen
let
god
arise
and
let
his
enemies
be
scattered
of
this
class
was
john
roberts
he
threw
off
his
knapsack
and
went
back
to
his
small
homestead
contented
with
the
privilege
of
supporting
himself
and
family
by
daily
toil
and
grumbling
in
concert
with
his
old
campaign
brothers
at
the
new
order
of
things
in
church
and
state
to
his
apprehension
the
golden
days
of
england
ended
with
the
parade
on
blackheath
to
receive
the
restored
king
he
manifested
no
reverence
for
bishops
and
lords
for
he
felt
none
for
the
presbyterians
he
had
no
good
will
they
had
brought
in
the
king
and
they
denied
the
liberty
of
prophesying
john
milton
has
expressed
the
feeling
of
the
independents
and
anabaptists
towards
this
latter
class
in
that
famous
line
in
which
he
defines
presbyter
as
old
priest
writ
large
roberts
was
by
no
means
a
gloomy
fanatic
he
had
a
great
deal
of
shrewdness
and
humor
loved
a
quiet
joke
and
every
gambling
priest
and
swearing
magistrate
in
the
neighborhood
stood
in
fear
of
his
sharp
wit
it
was
quite
in
course
for
such
a
man
to
fall
in
with
the
quakers
and
he
appears
to
have
done
so
at
the
first
opportunity
in
the
year
it
pleased
the
lord
to
send
two
women
friends
out
of
the
north
to
cirencester
who
inquiring
after
such
as
feared
god
were
directed
to
the
house
of
john
roberts
he
received
them
kindly
and
inviting
in
some
of
his
neighbors
sat
down
with
them
whereupon
the
friends
spake
a
few
words
which
had
a
good
effect
after
the
meeting
was
over
he
was
induced
to
visit
a
friend
then
confined
in
banbury
jail
whom
he
found
preaching
through
the
grates
of
his
cell
to
the
people
in
the
street
on
seeing
roberts
he
called
to
mind
the
story
of
zaccheus
and
declared
that
the
word
was
now
to
all
who
were
seeking
christ
by
climbing
the
tree
of
knowledge
come
down
come
down
for
that
which
is
to
be
known
of
god
is
manifested
within
returning
home
he
went
soon
after
to
the
parish
and
entering
with
his
hat
on
the
priest
noticed
him
and
stopping
short
in
his
discourse
declared
that
he
could
not
go
on
while
one
of
the
congregation
wore
his
hat
he
was
thereupon
led
out
of
the
house
and
a
rude
fellow
stealing
up
behind
struck
him
on
the
back
with
a
heavy
stone
take
that
for
god
sake
said
the
ruffian
so
i
do
answered
roberts
without
looking
back
to
see
his
assailant
who
the
next
day
came
and
asked
his
forgiveness
for
the
injury
as
he
could
not
sleep
in
consequence
of
it
we
next
find
him
attending
the
quarter
sessions
where
three
friends
were
arraigned
for
entering
cirencester
church
with
their
hats
on
venturing
to
utter
a
word
of
remonstrance
against
the
summary
proceedings
of
the
court
justice
stephens
demanded
his
name
and
on
being
told
exclaimed
in
the
very
tone
and
temper
of
jeffreys
i
heard
of
you
i
glad
i
have
you
here
you
deserve
a
stone
doublet
there
many
an
honester
man
than
you
hanged
it
may
be
so
said
roberts
but
what
becomes
of
such
as
hang
honest
men
the
justice
snatched
a
ball
of
wax
and
hurled
it
at
the
quiet
questioner
i
send
you
to
prison
said
he
and
if
any
insurrection
or
tumult
occurs
i
come
and
cut
your
throat
with
my
own
sword
a
warrant
was
made
out
and
he
was
forthwith
sent
to
the
jail
in
the
evening
justice
sollis
his
uncle
released
him
on
condition
of
his
promise
to
appear
at
the
next
sessions
he
returned
to
his
home
but
in
the
night
following
he
was
impressed
with
a
belief
that
it
was
his
duty
to
visit
justice
stephens
early
in
the
morning
with
a
heavy
heart
without
eating
or
drinking
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
towards
the
residence
of
his
enemy
when
he
came
in
sight
of
the
house
he
felt
strong
misgivings
that
his
uncle
justice
sollis
who
had
so
kindly
released
him
and
his
neighbors
generally
would
condemn
him
for
voluntarily
running
into
danger
and
drawing
down
trouble
upon
himself
and
family
he
alighted
from
his
horse
and
sat
on
the
ground
in
great
doubt
and
sorrow
when
a
voice
seemed
to
speak
within
him
go
and
i
will
go
with
thee
the
justice
met
him
at
the
door
i
am
come
said
roberts
in
the
fear
and
dread
of
heaven
to
warn
thee
to
repent
of
thy
wickedness
with
speed
lest
the
lord
send
thee
to
the
pit
that
is
bottomless
this
terrible
summons
awed
the
justice
he
made
roberts
sit
down
on
his
couch
beside
him
declaring
that
he
received
the
message
from
god
and
asked
forgiveness
for
the
wrong
he
had
done
him
the
parish
vicar
of
siddington
at
this
time
was
george
bull
afterwards
bishop
of
david
whom
macaulay
speaks
of
as
the
only
rural
parish
priest
who
during
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
noted
as
a
theologian
or
who
possessed
a
respectable
library
roberts
refused
to
pay
the
vicar
his
tithes
and
the
vicar
sent
him
to
prison
it
was
the
priest
short
method
with
dissenters
while
the
sturdy
conformist
lay
in
prison
he
was
visited
by
the
great
woman
of
the
neighborhood
lady
dunch
of
down
amney
what
do
you
lie
in
jail
for
inquired
the
lady
roberts
replied
that
it
was
because
he
could
not
put
bread
into
the
mouth
of
a
hireling
priest
the
lady
suggested
that
he
might
let
somebody
else
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
priest
and
that
she
had
a
mind
to
do
this
herself
as
she
wished
to
talk
with
him
on
religious
subjects
to
this
roberts
objected
there
were
poor
people
who
needed
her
charities
which
would
be
wasted
on
such
devourers
as
the
priests
who
like
pharaoh
lean
kine
were
eating
up
the
fat
and
the
goodly
without
looking
a
whit
the
better
but
the
lady
who
seems
to
have
been
pleased
and
amused
by
the
obstinate
prisoner
paid
the
tithe
and
the
jail
fees
and
set
him
at
liberty
making
him
fix
a
day
when
he
would
visit
her
at
the
time
appointed
he
went
to
down
amney
and
was
overtaken
on
the
way
by
the
priest
of
cirencester
who
had
been
sent
for
to
meet
the
quaker
they
found
the
lady
ill
in
bed
but
she
had
them
brought
to
her
chamber
being
determined
not
to
lose
the
amusement
of
hearing
a
theological
discussion
to
which
she
at
once
urged
them
declaring
that
it
would
divert
her
and
do
her
good
the
parson
began
by
accusing
the
quakers
of
holding
popish
doctrines
the
quaker
retorted
by
telling
him
that
if
he
would
prove
the
quakers
like
the
papists
in
one
thing
by
the
help
of
god
he
would
prove
him
like
them
in
ten
after
a
brief
and
sharp
dispute
the
priest
finding
his
adversary
wit
too
keen
for
his
comfort
hastily
took
his
leave
the
next
we
hear
of
roberts
he
is
in
gloucester
castle
subjected
to
the
brutal
usage
of
a
jailer
who
took
a
malicious
satisfaction
in
thrusting
decent
and
respectable
dissenters
imprisoned
for
matters
of
conscience
among
felons
and
thieves
a
poor
vagabond
tinker
was
hired
to
play
at
night
on
his
hautboy
and
prevent
their
sleeping
but
roberts
spoke
to
him
in
such
a
manner
that
the
instrument
fell
from
his
hand
and
he
told
the
jailer
that
he
would
play
no
more
though
he
should
hang
him
up
at
the
door
for
it
how
he
was
released
from
jail
does
not
appear
but
the
narrative
tells
us
that
some
time
after
an
apparitor
came
to
cite
him
to
the
bishop
court
at
gloucester
when
he
was
brought
before
the
court
bishop
nicholson
a
and
prelate
asked
him
the
number
of
his
children
and
how
many
of
them
had
been
none
that
i
know
of
said
roberts
what
reason
asked
the
bishop
do
you
give
for
this
a
very
good
one
said
the
quaker
most
of
my
children
were
born
in
oliver
days
when
bishops
were
out
of
fashion
the
bishop
and
the
court
laughed
at
this
sally
and
proceeded
to
question
him
touching
his
views
of
baptism
roberts
admitted
that
john
had
a
divine
commission
to
baptize
with
water
but
that
he
never
heard
of
anybody
else
that
had
the
bishop
reminded
him
that
christ
disciples
baptized
what
that
to
me
responded
roberts
paul
says
he
was
not
sent
to
baptize
but
to
preach
the
gospel
and
if
he
was
not
sent
who
required
it
at
his
hands
perhaps
he
had
as
little
thanks
for
his
labor
as
thou
hast
for
thine
and
i
would
willingly
know
who
sent
thee
to
baptize
the
bishop
evaded
this
home
question
and
told
him
he
was
there
to
answer
for
not
coming
to
church
roberts
denied
the
charge
sometimes
he
went
to
church
and
sometimes
it
came
to
him
i
do
call
that
a
church
which
you
do
which
is
made
of
wood
and
stone
what
do
you
call
it
asked
the
bishop
it
might
be
properly
called
a
was
the
reply
for
it
was
built
for
that
purpose
the
bishop
here
told
him
he
might
go
for
the
present
he
would
take
another
opportunity
to
convince
him
of
his
errors
the
next
person
called
was
a
baptist
minister
who
seeing
that
roberts
refused
to
put
off
his
hat
kept
on
his
also
the
bishop
sternly
reminded
him
that
he
stood
before
the
king
court
and
the
representative
of
the
majesty
of
england
and
that
while
some
regard
might
be
had
to
the
scruples
of
men
who
made
a
conscience
of
putting
off
the
hat
such
contempt
could
not
be
tolerated
on
the
part
of
one
who
could
put
it
off
to
every
mechanic
be
met
the
baptist
pulled
off
his
hat
and
apologized
on
the
ground
of
illness
we
find
roberts
next
following
george
fox
on
a
visit
to
bristol
on
his
return
reaching
his
house
late
in
the
evening
he
saw
a
man
standing
in
the
moonlight
at
his
door
and
knew
him
to
be
a
bailiff
hast
thou
anything
against
me
asked
roberts
no
said
the
bailiff
i
wronged
you
enough
god
forgive
me
those
who
lie
in
wait
for
you
are
my
lord
bishop
bailiffs
they
are
merciless
rogues
ever
my
master
while
you
live
please
a
knave
for
an
honest
man
wo
hurt
you
the
next
morning
having
as
he
thought
been
warned
by
a
dream
to
do
so
he
went
to
the
bishop
house
at
cleave
near
gloucester
confronting
the
bishop
in
his
own
hall
he
told
him
that
he
had
come
to
know
why
he
was
hunting
after
him
with
his
bailiffs
and
why
he
was
his
adversary
the
king
is
your
adversary
said
the
bishop
you
have
broken
the
king
law
roberts
ventured
to
deny
the
justice
of
the
law
what
cried
the
bishop
do
such
men
as
you
find
fault
with
the
laws
yes
replied
the
other
stoutly
and
i
tell
thee
plainly
to
thy
face
it
is
high
time
wiser
men
were
chosen
to
make
better
laws
the
discourse
turning
upon
the
book
of
common
prayer
roberts
asked
the
bishop
if
the
sin
of
idolatry
did
not
consist
in
worshipping
the
work
of
men
hands
the
bishop
admitted
it
as
in
the
case
of
image
then
said
roberts
whose
hands
made
your
prayer
book
it
could
not
make
itself
do
you
compare
our
prayer
book
to
nebuchadnezzar
image
cried
the
bishop
yes
returned
roberts
that
was
his
image
this
is
thine
i
no
more
dare
bow
to
thy
book
than
the
three
children
to
nebuchadnezzar
image
yours
is
a
strange
upstart
religion
said
the
bishop
roberts
told
him
it
was
older
than
his
by
several
hundred
years
at
this
claim
of
antiquity
the
prelate
was
greatly
amused
and
told
roberts
that
if
he
would
make
out
his
case
he
should
speed
the
better
for
it
let
me
ask
thee
said
roberts
where
thy
religion
was
in
days
when
thy
book
was
as
little
regarded
as
an
old
almanac
and
your
priests
with
a
few
honest
exceptions
turned
with
the
tide
and
if
oliver
had
put
mass
in
their
mouths
would
have
conformed
to
it
for
the
sake
of
their
bellies
what
would
you
have
us
do
asked
the
bishop
would
you
have
had
oliver
cut
our
throats
no
said
roberts
but
what
sort
of
religion
was
that
which
you
were
afraid
to
venture
your
throats
for
the
bishop
interrupted
him
to
say
that
in
oliver
days
he
had
never
owned
any
other
religion
than
his
own
although
he
did
not
dare
to
openly
maintain
it
as
he
then
did
well
continued
roberts
if
thou
didst
not
think
thy
religion
worth
venturing
thy
throat
for
then
i
desire
thee
to
consider
that
it
is
not
worth
the
cutting
of
other
men
throats
now
for
not
conforming
to
it
you
are
right
responded
the
frank
bishop
i
hope
we
shall
have
a
care
how
we
cut
men
throats
the
following
colloquy
throws
some
light
on
the
condition
and
character
of
the
rural
clergy
at
this
period
and
goes
far
to
confirm
the
statements
of
macaulay
which
many
have
supposed
exaggerated
early
religious
teachers
were
more
exceptionable
than
even
the
maudlin
mummer
whom
roberts
speaks
of
one
of
them
being
the
excellentest
player
in
all
the
country
and
a
good
gamester
and
goodfellow
who
having
received
holy
orders
forged
the
like
for
a
neighbor
son
who
on
the
strength
of
that
title
officiated
at
the
desk
and
altar
and
after
him
came
an
attorney
clerk
who
had
tippled
himself
into
so
great
poverty
that
he
had
no
other
way
to
live
than
to
preach
roberts
i
was
bred
up
under
a
priest
and
a
poor
drunken
old
man
he
was
sometimes
he
was
so
drunk
he
could
not
say
his
prayers
and
at
best
he
could
but
say
them
though
i
think
he
was
by
far
a
better
man
than
he
that
is
priest
there
now
bishop
who
is
your
minister
now
roberts
my
minister
is
christ
jesus
the
minister
of
the
everlasting
covenant
but
the
present
priest
of
the
parish
is
george
bull
bishop
do
you
say
that
drunken
old
man
was
better
than
bull
i
tell
you
i
account
bull
as
sound
able
and
orthodox
a
divine
as
any
we
have
among
us
robert
i
am
sorry
for
that
for
if
he
be
one
of
the
best
of
you
i
believe
the
lord
will
not
suffer
you
long
for
he
is
a
proud
ambitious
ungodly
man
he
hath
often
sued
me
at
law
and
brought
his
servants
to
swear
against
me
wrongfully
his
servants
themselves
have
confessed
to
my
servants
that
i
might
have
their
ears
for
their
master
made
them
drunk
and
then
told
them
they
were
set
down
in
the
list
as
witnesses
against
me
and
they
must
swear
to
it
and
so
they
did
and
brought
treble
damages
they
likewise
owned
they
took
tithes
from
my
servants
threshed
them
out
and
sold
them
for
their
master
they
have
also
several
times
took
my
cattle
out
of
my
grounds
drove
them
to
fairs
and
markets
and
sold
them
without
giving
me
any
account
bishop
i
do
assure
you
i
will
inform
bull
of
what
you
say
roberts
very
well
and
if
thou
pleasest
to
send
for
me
to
face
him
i
shall
make
much
more
appear
to
his
face
than
i
say
behind
his
back
after
much
more
discourse
roberts
told
the
bishop
that
if
it
would
do
him
any
good
to
have
him
in
jail
he
would
voluntarily
go
and
deliver
himself
up
to
the
keeper
of
gloucester
castle
the
prelate
relented
at
this
and
said
he
should
not
be
molested
or
injured
and
further
manifested
his
good
will
by
ordering
refreshments
one
of
the
bishop
friends
who
was
present
was
highly
offended
by
the
freedom
of
roberts
with
his
lordship
and
undertook
to
rebuke
him
but
was
so
readily
answered
that
he
flew
into
a
rage
if
all
the
quakers
in
england
said
he
are
not
hanged
in
a
month
time
i
be
hanged
for
them
prithee
friend
quoth
roberts
remember
and
be
as
good
as
thy
word
good
old
bishop
nicholson
it
would
seem
really
liked
his
incorrigible
quaker
neighbor
and
could
enjoy
heartily
his
wit
and
humor
even
when
exercised
at
the
expense
of
his
own
ecclesiastical
dignity
he
admired
his
blunt
honesty
and
courage
surrounded
by
flatterers
and
seekers
he
found
satisfaction
in
the
company
and
conversation
of
one
who
setting
aside
all
conventionalisms
saw
only
in
my
lord
bishop
a
poor
and
addressed
him
on
terms
of
conscious
equality
the
indulgence
which
he
extended
to
him
naturally
enough
provoked
many
of
the
inferior
clergy
who
had
been
sorely
annoyed
by
the
sturdy
dissenter
irreverent
witticisms
and
unsparing
ridicule
vicar
bull
of
siddington
and
priest
careless
of
cirencester
in
particular
urged
the
bishop
to
deal
sharply
with
him
the
former
accused
him
of
dealing
in
the
black
art
and
filled
the
bishop
ear
with
certain
marvellous
stories
of
his
preternatural
sagacity
and
discernment
in
discovering
cattle
which
were
lost
the
bishop
took
occasion
to
inquire
into
these
stories
and
was
told
by
roberts
that
except
in
a
single
instance
the
discoveries
were
the
result
of
his
acquaintance
with
the
habits
of
animals
and
his
knowledge
of
the
localities
where
they
were
lost
the
circumstance
alluded
to
as
an
exception
will
be
best
related
in
his
own
words
i
had
a
poor
neighbor
who
had
a
wife
and
six
children
and
whom
the
chief
men
about
us
permitted
to
keep
six
or
seven
cows
upon
the
waste
which
were
the
principal
support
of
the
family
and
preserved
them
from
becoming
chargeable
to
the
parish
one
very
stormy
night
the
cattle
were
left
in
the
yard
as
usual
but
could
not
be
found
in
the
morning
the
man
and
his
sons
had
sought
them
to
no
purpose
and
after
they
had
been
lost
four
days
his
wife
came
to
me
and
in
a
great
deal
of
grief
cried
lord
master
hayward
we
are
undone
my
husband
and
i
must
go
a
begging
in
our
old
age
we
have
lost
all
our
cows
my
husband
and
the
boys
have
been
round
the
country
and
can
hear
nothing
of
them
down
on
my
bare
knees
if
you
stand
our
friend
i
desired
she
would
not
be
in
such
an
agony
and
told
her
she
should
not
down
on
her
knees
to
me
but
i
would
gladly
help
them
in
what
i
could
know
said
she
are
a
good
man
and
god
will
hear
your
prayers
i
desire
thee
said
i
to
be
still
and
quiet
in
thy
mind
perhaps
thy
husband
or
sons
may
hear
of
them
if
not
let
thy
husband
get
a
horse
and
come
to
me
morning
as
soon
as
he
will
and
i
think
if
it
please
god
to
go
with
him
to
seek
then
the
woman
seemed
transported
with
joy
crying
we
shall
have
our
cows
again
her
faith
being
so
strong
brought
the
greater
exercise
on
me
with
strong
cries
to
the
lord
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
make
me
instrumental
in
his
hand
for
the
help
of
the
poor
family
in
the
morning
early
comes
the
old
man
in
the
name
of
god
says
he
which
way
shall
we
go
to
seek
them
i
being
deeply
concerned
in
my
mind
did
not
answer
him
till
he
had
thrice
repeated
it
and
then
i
answered
in
the
name
of
god
i
would
go
to
seek
them
and
said
before
i
was
well
aware
we
will
go
to
malmsbury
and
at
the
fair
we
shall
find
them
when
i
had
spoken
the
words
i
was
much
troubled
lest
they
should
not
prove
true
it
was
very
early
and
the
first
man
we
saw
i
asked
him
if
he
had
seen
any
stray
milch
cows
thereabouts
what
manner
of
cattle
are
they
said
he
and
the
old
man
describing
their
mark
and
number
he
told
us
there
were
some
stood
chewing
their
cuds
in
the
but
thinking
they
belonged
to
some
in
the
neighborhood
he
did
not
take
particular
notice
of
them
when
we
came
to
the
place
the
old
man
found
them
to
be
his
but
suffered
his
transports
of
joy
to
rise
so
high
that
i
was
ashamed
of
his
behavior
for
he
fell
a
hallooing
and
threw
up
his
montier
cap
in
the
air
several
times
till
he
raised
the
neighbors
out
of
their
beds
to
see
what
was
the
matter
said
he
had
lost
my
cows
four
or
five
days
ago
and
thought
i
should
never
see
them
again
and
this
honest
neighbor
of
mine
told
me
this
morning
by
his
own
fire
side
nine
miles
off
that
here
i
should
find
them
and
here
i
have
them
then
up
goes
his
cap
again
i
begged
of
the
poor
man
to
be
quiet
and
take
his
cows
home
and
be
thankful
as
indeed
i
was
being
reverently
bowed
in
my
spirit
before
the
lord
in
that
he
was
pleased
to
put
the
words
of
truth
into
my
mouth
and
the
man
drove
his
cattle
home
to
the
great
joy
of
his
family
not
long
after
the
interview
with
the
bishop
at
his
own
palace
which
has
been
related
that
dignitary
with
the
lord
chancellor
in
their
coaches
and
about
twenty
clergymen
on
horseback
made
a
call
at
the
humble
dwelling
of
roberts
on
their
way
to
tedbury
where
the
bishop
was
to
hold
a
visitation
i
could
not
go
out
of
the
country
without
seeing
you
said
the
prelate
as
the
farmer
came
to
his
coach
door
and
pressed
him
to
alight
john
asked
priest
evans
the
bishop
kinsman
is
your
house
free
to
entertain
such
men
as
we
are
yes
george
said
roberts
i
entertain
honest
men
and
sometimes
others
my
lord
said
evans
turning
to
the
bishop
john
friends
are
the
honest
men
and
we
are
the
others
the
bishop
told
roberts
that
they
could
not
then
alight
but
would
gladly
drink
with
him
whereupon
the
good
wife
brought
out
her
best
beer
i
commend
you
john
quoth
the
bishop
as
he
paused
from
his
hearty
draught
you
keep
a
cup
of
good
beer
in
your
house
i
have
not
drank
any
that
has
pleased
me
better
since
i
left
home
the
cup
passed
next
to
the
chancellor
and
finally
came
to
priest
bull
who
thrust
it
aside
declaring
that
it
was
full
of
hops
and
heresy
as
to
hops
roberts
replied
he
could
not
say
but
as
for
heresy
he
bade
the
priest
take
note
that
the
lord
bishop
had
drank
of
it
and
had
found
no
heresy
in
the
cup
the
bishop
leaned
over
his
coach
door
and
whispered
john
i
advise
you
to
take
care
you
do
offend
against
the
higher
powers
i
have
heard
great
complaints
against
you
that
you
are
the
ringleader
of
the
quakers
in
this
country
and
that
if
you
are
not
suppressed
all
will
signify
nothing
therefore
pray
john
take
care
for
the
future
you
offend
any
more
i
like
thy
counsel
very
well
answered
roberts
and
intend
to
take
it
but
thou
knowest
god
is
the
higher
power
and
you
mortal
men
however
advanced
in
this
world
are
but
the
lower
power
and
it
is
only
because
i
endeavor
to
be
obedient
to
the
will
of
the
higher
powers
that
the
lower
powers
are
angry
with
me
but
i
hope
with
the
assistance
of
god
to
take
thy
counsel
and
be
subject
to
the
higher
powers
let
the
lower
powers
do
with
me
as
it
may
please
god
to
suffer
them
the
bishop
then
said
he
would
like
to
talk
with
him
further
and
requested
him
to
meet
him
at
tedbury
the
next
day
at
the
time
appointed
roberts
went
to
the
inn
where
the
bishop
lodged
and
was
invited
to
dine
with
him
after
dinner
was
over
the
prelate
told
him
that
he
must
go
to
church
and
leave
off
holding
conventicles
at
his
house
of
which
great
complaint
was
made
this
he
flatly
refused
to
do
and
the
bishop
losing
patience
ordered
the
constable
to
be
sent
for
roberts
told
him
that
if
after
coming
to
his
house
under
the
guise
of
friendship
he
should
betray
him
and
send
him
to
prison
he
who
had
hitherto
commended
him
for
his
moderation
would
put
his
name
in
print
and
cause
it
to
stink
before
all
sober
people
it
was
the
priests
he
told
him
who
set
him
on
but
instead
of
hearkening
to
them
he
should
commend
them
to
some
honest
vocation
and
not
suffer
them
to
rob
their
honest
neighbors
and
feed
on
the
fruits
of
other
men
toil
like
caterpillars
whom
do
you
call
caterpillars
cried
priest
rich
of
north
surrey
we
farmers
said
roberts
call
those
so
who
live
on
other
fields
and
by
the
sweat
of
other
men
brows
and
if
thou
dost
so
thou
mayst
be
one
of
them
this
reply
so
enraged
the
bishop
attendants
that
they
could
only
be
appeased
by
an
order
for
the
constable
to
take
him
to
jail
in
fact
there
was
some
ground
for
complaint
of
a
lack
of
courtesy
on
the
part
of
the
blunt
farmer
and
the
christian
virtue
of
forbearance
even
in
bishops
has
its
limits
the
constable
obeying
the
summons
came
to
the
inn
at
the
door
of
which
the
landlady
met
him
what
do
you
here
cried
the
good
woman
when
honest
john
is
going
to
be
sent
to
prison
here
come
along
with
me
the
constable
nothing
loath
followed
her
into
a
private
room
where
she
concealed
him
word
was
sent
to
the
bishop
that
the
constable
was
not
to
be
found
and
the
prelate
telling
roberts
he
could
send
him
to
jail
in
the
afternoon
dismissed
him
until
evening
at
the
hour
appointed
the
latter
waited
upon
the
bishop
and
found
with
him
only
one
priest
and
a
lay
gentleman
the
priest
begged
the
bishop
to
be
allowed
to
discourse
with
the
prisoner
and
leave
being
granted
he
began
by
telling
roberts
that
the
knowledge
of
the
scriptures
had
made
him
mad
and
that
it
was
a
great
pity
he
had
ever
seen
them
thou
art
an
unworthy
man
said
the
quaker
and
i
not
dispute
with
thee
if
the
knowledge
of
the
scriptures
has
made
me
mad
the
knowledge
of
the
hath
almost
made
thee
mad
and
if
we
two
madmen
should
dispute
about
religion
we
should
make
mad
work
of
it
an
please
you
my
lord
said
the
scandalized
priest
he
says
i
drunk
the
bishop
asked
roberts
to
repeat
his
words
and
instead
of
reprimanding
him
as
the
priest
expected
was
so
much
amused
that
he
held
up
his
hands
and
laughed
whereupon
the
offended
inferior
took
a
hasty
leave
the
bishop
who
was
evidently
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
now
turned
to
roberts
and
complained
that
he
had
dealt
hardly
with
him
in
telling
him
before
so
many
gentlemen
that
he
had
sought
to
betray
him
by
professions
of
friendship
in
order
to
send
him
to
prison
and
that
if
he
had
not
done
as
he
did
people
would
have
reported
him
as
an
encourager
of
the
quakers
but
now
john
said
the
good
prelate
burn
the
warrant
against
you
before
your
face
you
know
burnet
he
continued
addressing
his
attendant
that
a
ring
of
bells
may
be
made
of
excellent
metal
but
they
may
be
out
of
tune
so
we
may
say
of
john
he
is
a
man
of
as
good
metal
as
i
ever
met
with
but
quite
out
of
tune
thou
mayst
well
say
so
quoth
roberts
for
i
ca
tune
after
thy
pipe
the
inferior
clergy
were
by
no
means
so
lenient
as
the
bishop
they
regarded
roberts
as
the
ringleader
of
dissent
an
impracticable
obstinate
contumacious
heretic
not
only
refusing
to
pay
them
tithes
himself
but
encouraging
others
to
the
same
course
hence
they
thought
it
necessary
to
visit
upon
him
the
full
rigor
of
the
law
his
crops
were
taken
from
his
field
and
his
cattle
from
his
yard
he
was
often
committed
to
the
jail
where
on
one
occasion
he
was
kept
with
many
others
for
a
long
time
through
the
malice
of
the
jailer
who
refused
to
put
the
names
of
his
prisoners
in
the
calendar
that
they
might
have
a
hearing
but
the
spirit
of
the
old
commonwealth
man
remained
steadfast
when
justice
george
at
the
ram
in
cirencester
told
him
he
must
conform
and
go
to
church
or
suffer
the
penalty
of
the
law
he
replied
that
he
had
heard
indeed
that
some
were
formerly
whipped
out
of
the
temple
but
he
had
never
heard
of
any
being
whipped
in
the
justice
pointing
through
the
open
window
of
the
inn
at
the
church
tower
asked
him
what
that
was
thou
mayst
call
it
a
answered
the
incorrigible
quaker
dost
thou
not
see
how
the
jackdaws
flock
about
it
sometimes
it
happened
that
the
clergyman
was
also
a
magistrate
and
united
in
his
own
person
the
authority
of
the
state
and
the
zeal
of
the
church
justice
parsons
of
gloucester
was
a
functionary
of
this
sort
he
wielded
the
sword
of
the
spirit
on
the
sabbath
against
dissenters
and
on
week
days
belabored
them
with
the
arm
of
flesh
and
the
staff
at
one
time
he
had
between
forty
and
fifty
of
them
locked
up
in
gloucester
castle
among
them
roberts
and
his
sons
on
the
charge
of
attending
conventicles
but
the
troublesome
prisoners
baffled
his
vigilance
and
turned
their
prison
into
a
and
held
their
conventicles
in
defiance
of
him
the
reverend
justice
pounced
upon
them
on
one
occasion
with
his
attendants
an
old
man
formerly
a
strolling
was
preaching
when
he
came
in
the
justice
laid
hold
of
him
by
his
white
locks
and
strove
to
pull
him
down
but
the
tall
stood
firm
and
spoke
on
he
then
tried
to
gag
him
but
failed
in
that
also
he
demanded
the
names
of
the
prisoners
but
no
one
answered
him
a
voice
we
fancy
it
was
that
of
our
old
friend
roberts
called
out
the
devil
must
be
hard
put
to
it
to
have
his
drudgery
done
when
the
priests
must
leave
their
pulpits
to
turn
informers
against
poor
prisoners
the
justice
obtained
a
list
of
the
names
of
the
prisoners
made
out
on
their
commitment
and
taking
it
for
granted
that
all
were
still
present
issued
warrants
for
the
collection
of
fines
by
levies
upon
their
estates
among
the
names
was
that
of
a
poor
widow
who
had
been
discharged
and
was
living
at
the
time
the
clerical
magistrate
swore
she
was
at
the
meeting
twenty
miles
distant
from
the
prison
soon
after
this
event
our
old
friend
fell
sick
he
had
been
discharged
from
prison
but
his
sons
were
still
confined
the
eldest
had
leave
however
to
attend
him
in
his
illness
and
he
bears
his
testimony
that
the
lord
was
pleased
to
favor
his
father
with
his
living
presence
in
his
last
moments
in
keeping
with
the
sturdy
life
he
was
interred
at
the
foot
of
his
own
orchard
in
siddington
a
spot
he
had
selected
for
a
long
before
where
neither
the
foot
of
a
priest
nor
the
shadow
of
a
could
rest
upon
his
grave
in
closing
our
notice
of
this
pleasant
old
narrative
we
may
remark
that
the
light
it
sheds
upon
the
antagonistic
religious
parties
of
the
time
is
calculated
to
dissipate
prejudices
and
correct
misapprehensions
common
alike
to
churchmen
and
dissenters
the
genial
humor
sound
sense
and
sterling
virtues
of
the
quaker
farmer
should
teach
the
one
class
that
poor
james
nayler
in
his
craziness
and
folly
was
not
a
fair
representative
of
his
sect
while
the
kind
nature
the
hearty
appreciation
of
goodness
and
the
generosity
and
candor
of
bishop
nicholson
should
convince
the
other
class
that
a
prelate
is
not
necessarily
and
by
virtue
of
his
mitre
a
laud
or
a
bonner
the
dissenters
of
the
seventeenth
century
may
well
be
forgiven
for
the
asperity
of
their
language
men
whose
ears
had
been
cropped
because
they
would
not
recognize
charles
as
a
blessed
martyr
and
his
scandalous
son
as
the
head
of
the
church
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
make
discriminations
or
suggest
palliating
circumstances
favorable
to
any
class
of
their
adversaries
to
use
the
homely
but
apt
simile
of
mcfingal
the
will
confirmed
by
treatment
horrid
as
hides
grow
harder
when
they
curried
they
were
wronged
and
they
told
the
world
of
it
unlike
cardinal
they
did
not
die
without
a
sign
they
branded
by
their
fierce
epithets
the
foreheads
of
their
persecutors
more
deeply
than
the
sheriff
hot
iron
did
their
own
if
they
lost
their
ears
they
enjoyed
the
satisfaction
of
making
those
of
their
oppressors
tingle
knowing
their
persecutors
to
be
in
the
wrong
they
did
not
always
inquire
whether
they
themselves
had
been
entirely
right
and
had
done
no
unrequired
works
of
supererogation
by
the
way
of
testimony
against
their
neighbors
mode
cf
worship
and
so
from
pillory
and
from
prison
and
scaffold
they
sent
forth
their
wail
and
execration
their
miserere
and
anathema
and
the
sound
thereof
has
reached
down
to
our
day
may
it
never
wholly
die
away
until
the
world
over
the
forcing
of
conscience
is
regarded
as
a
crime
against
humanity
and
a
usurpation
of
prerogative
but
abhorring
as
we
must
persecution
under
whatever
pretext
it
is
employed
we
are
not
therefore
to
conclude
that
all
persecutors
were
bad
and
unfeeling
men
many
of
their
severities
upon
which
we
now
look
back
with
horror
were
beyond
a
question
the
result
of
an
intense
anxiety
for
the
of
immortal
souls
endangered
by
the
poison
which
in
their
view
heresy
was
casting
into
the
waters
of
life
coleridge
in
one
of
the
moods
of
a
mind
which
traversed
in
imagination
the
vast
circle
of
human
experience
reaches
this
point
in
his
it
would
require
says
he
stronger
arguments
than
any
i
have
seen
to
convince
me
that
men
in
authority
have
not
a
right
involved
in
an
imperative
duty
to
deter
those
under
their
control
from
teaching
or
countenancing
doctrines
which
they
believe
to
be
damnable
and
even
to
punish
with
death
those
who
violate
such
prohibition
it
would
not
be
very
difficult
for
us
to
imagine
a
inquisitor
of
this
stamp
stifling
his
weak
compassion
for
the
shrieking
wretch
under
bodily
torment
by
his
strong
pity
for
souls
in
danger
of
perdition
from
the
sufferer
heresy
we
all
know
with
what
satisfaction
the
melanethon
heard
of
the
burning
of
servetus
and
with
what
zeal
he
defended
it
the
truth
is
the
notion
that
an
intellectual
recognition
of
certain
dogmas
is
the
essential
condition
of
salvation
lies
at
the
bottom
of
all
intolerance
in
matters
of
religion
under
this
impression
men
are
too
apt
to
forget
that
the
great
end
of
christianity
is
love
and
that
charity
is
its
crowning
virtue
they
overlook
the
beautiful
significance
of
the
parable
of
the
heretic
samaritan
and
the
orthodox
pharisee
and
thus
by
suffering
their
speculative
opinions
of
the
next
world
to
make
them
uncharitable
and
cruel
in
this
they
are
really
the
worse
for
them
even
admitting
them
to
be

hopkins
three
quarters
of
a
century
ago
the
name
of
samuel
hopkins
was
as
familiar
as
a
household
word
throughout
new
england
it
was
a
spell
wherewith
to
raise
at
once
a
storm
of
theological
controversy
the
venerable
minister
who
bore
it
had
his
thousands
of
ardent
young
disciples
as
well
as
defenders
and
followers
of
mature
age
and
acknowledged
talent
a
hundred
pulpits
propagated
the
dogmas
which
he
had
engrafted
on
the
stock
of
calvinism
nor
did
he
lack
numerous
and
powerful
antagonists
the
sledge
ecclesiastic
with
more
or
less
effect
was
unceasingly
plied
upon
the
chain
of
argument
which
he
slowly
and
painfully
elaborated
in
the
seclusion
of
his
parish
the
press
groaned
under
large
volumes
of
theological
metaphysical
and
psychological
disquisition
the
very
thought
of
which
is
now
a
weariness

the
flesh
in
rapid
succession

encountered
pamphlet
horned
beaked
and
sharp
of
talon
grappling
with
each
other
in
like
milton
angels
that
loud
controversy
the
sound
whereof
went
over
christendom
awakening
responses
from
beyond
the
atlantic
has
now
died
away
its
watchwords
no
longer
stir
the
blood
of
belligerent
sermonizers
its
very
terms
and
definitions
have
become
obsolete
and
unintelligible
the
hands
which

the
tongues
which

in
that
day

their
fame
is
still
in

effeminate

to
do
homage
to
their
memories
the

exploring
with
awe
the
mountainous
debris
of
their
controversial
lore
ponders
over
the
colossal
thoughts
entombed
therein
as
he
would
over
the
gigantic
fossils
of
an
early
creation
and
endeavors
in
vain
to
recall
to
the
skeleton
abstractions
before
him
the
warm
and
vigorous
life
wherewith
they
were
once
clothed
but
hopkinsianism
as
a
distinct
and
living
school
of
philosophy
theology
and
metaphysics
no
longer
exists
it
has
no
living
oracles
left
and
its
memory
survives
only
in
the
doctrinal
treatises
of
the
elder

it
is
no
part
of

to
discuss
the
merits
of

indeed
looking
at
the
great
controversy
which
divided

calvinism
in
the
eighteenth
century
from
a
point
of
view
which
secures
our
impartiality
and
freedom
from
prejudice
we
find
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
get
a
precise
idea
of
what
was
actually
at
issue
to
our
poor
comprehension
much
of
the
dispute
hinges
upon
names
rather
than
things
on
the
manner
of
reaching
conclusions
quite
as
much
as
upon
the
conclusions
themselves
its
origin
may
be
traced
to
the
great
religious
awakening
of
the
middle
of
the
past
century
when
the
dogmas
of
the
calvinistic
faith
were
subjected
to
the
inquiry
of
acute
and
earnest
minds
roused
up
from
the
incurious
ease
and
passive
indifference
of
nominal
orthodoxy
without
intending
it
it
broke
down
some
of
the
barriers
which
separated
arminianism
and
calvinism
its
product
hopkinsianism
while
it
pushed
the
doctrine
of
the
genevan
reformer
on
the
subject
of
the
divine
decrees
and
agency
to
that
extreme
point
where
it
loses
itself
in
pantheism
held
at
the
same
time
that
guilt
could
not
be
hereditary
that
man
being
responsible
for
his
sinful
acts
and
not
for
his
sinful
nature
can
only
be
justified
by
a
personal
holiness
consisting
not
so
much
in
legal
obedience
as
in
that
disinterested
benevolence
which
prefers
the
glory
of
god
and
the
welfare
of
universal
being
above
the
happiness
of
self
it
had
the
merit
whatever
it
may
be
of
reducing
the
doctrines
of
the
reformation
to
an
ingenious
and
scholastic
form
of
theology
of
bringing
them
boldly
to
the
test
of
reason
and
philosophy
its
leading
advocates
were
not
mere
heartless
reasoners
and
closet
speculators
they
taught
that
sin
was
selfishness
and
holiness
benevolence
and
they
endeavored
to
practise
accordingly
their
lives
recommended
their
doctrines
they
were
bold
and
faithful
in
the
discharge
of
what
they
regarded
as
duty
in
the
midst
of
and
in
an
age
of
comparative
darkness
on
the
subject
of
human
rights
hopkins
and
the
younger
edwards
lifted
up
their
voices
for
the
slave
and
twelve
years
ago
when
abolitionism
was
everywhere
spoken
against
and
the
whole
land
was
convulsed
with
mobs
to
suppress
it
the
venerable
emmons
burdened
with
the
weight
of
ninety
years
made
a
journey
to
new
york
to
attend
a
meeting
of
the
slavery
society
let
those
who
condemn
the
creed
of
these
men
see
to
it
that
they
do
not
fall
behind
them
in
practical
righteousness
and
faithfulness
to
the
convictions
of
duty
samuel
hopkins
who
gave
his
name
to
the
religious
system
in
question
was
born
in
waterbury
connecticut
in
in
his
fifteenth
year
he
was
placed
under
the
care
of
a
neighboring
clergyman
preparatory
for
college
which
he
entered
about
a
year
after
in
the
celebrated
whitefield
visited
new
haven
and
awakened
there
as
elsewhere
serious
inquiry
on
religious
subjects
he
was
followed
the
succeeding
spring
by
gilbert
tennent
the
new
jersey
revivalist
a
stirring
and
powerful
preacher
a
great
change
took
place
in
the
college
all
the
phenomena
which
president
edwards
has
described
in
his
account
of
the
northampton
awakening
were
reproduced
among
the
students
the
excellent
david
brainard
then
a
member
of
the
college
visited
hopkins
in
his
apartment
and
by
a
few
plain
and
earnest
words
convinced
him
that
he
was
a
stranger
to
vital
christianity
in
his
autobiographical
sketch
he
describes
in
simple
and
affecting
language
the
dark
and
desolate
state
of
his
mind
at
this
period
and
the
particular
exercise
which
finally
afforded
him
some
degree
of
relief
and
which
he
afterwards
appears
to
have
regarded
as
his
conversion
from
spiritual
death
to
life
when
he
first
heard
tennent
regarding
him
as
the
greatest
as
well
as
the
best
of
men
he
made
up
his
mind
to
study
theology
with
him
but
just
before
the
commencement
at
which
he
was
to
take
his
degree
the
elder
edwards
preached
at
new
haven
struck
by
the
power
of
the
great
theologian
he
at
once
resolved
to
make
him
his
spiritual
father
in
the
winter
following
he
left
his
father
house
on
horseback
on
a
journey
of
eighty
miles
to
northampton
arriving
at
the
house
of
president
edwards
he
was
disappointed
by
hearing
that
he
was
absent
on
a
preaching
tour
but
he
was
kindly
received
by
the
gifted
and
accomplished
lady
of
the
mansion
and
encouraged
to
remain
during
the
winter
still
doubtful
in
respect
to
his
own
spiritual
state
he
was
he
says
very
gloomy
and
retired
most
of
the
time
in
his
chamber
the
kind
heart
of
his
amiable
hostess
was
touched
by
his
evident
affliction
after
some
days
she
came
to
his
chamber
and
with
the
gentleness
and
delicacy
of
a
true
woman
inquired
into
the
cause
of
his
unhappiness
the
young
student
disclosed
to
her
without
reserve
the
state
of
his
feelings
and
the
extent
of
his
fears
she
told
me
says
the
doctor
that
she
had
had
peculiar
exercises
respecting
me
since
i
had
been
in
the
family
that
she
trusted
i
should
receive
light
and
comfort
and
doubted
not
that
god
intended
yet
to
do
great
things
by
me
after
pursuing
his
studies
for
some
months
with
the
puritan
philosopher
young
hopkins
commenced
preaching
and
in
was
ordained
at
sheffield
now
great
barrington
in
the
western
part
of
massachusetts
there
were
at
the
time
only
about
thirty
families
in
the
town
he
says
it
was
a
matter
of
great
regret
to
him
to
be
obliged
to
settle
so
far
from
his
spiritual
guide
and
tutor
but
seven
years
after
he
was
relieved
and
gratified
by
the
removal
of
edwards
to
stockbridge
as
the
indian
missionary
at
that
station
seven
miles
only
from
his
own
residence
and
for
several
years
the
great
metaphysician
and
his
favorite
pupil
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
familiar
intercourse
with
each
other
the
removal
of
the
former
in
to
princeton
new
jersey
and
his
death
which
soon
followed
are
mentioned
in
the
diary
of
hopkins
as
sore
trials
and
afflictive
dispensations
obtaining
a
dismissal
from
his
society
in
great
barrington
in
he
was
installed
at
newport
the
next
year
as
minister
of
the
first
congregational
church
in
that
place
newport
at
this
period
was
in
size
wealth
and
commercial
importance
the
second
town
in
new
england
it
was
the
great
slave
mart
of
the
north
vessels
loaded
with
stolen
men
and
women
and
children
consigned
to
its
merchant
princes
lay
at
its
wharves
immortal
beings
were
sold
daily
in
its
market
like
cattle
at
a
fair
the
soul
of
hopkins
was
moved
by
the
appalling
spectacle
a
strong
conviction
of
the
great
wrong
of
slavery
and
of
its
utter
incompatibility
with
the
christian
profession
seized
upon
his
mind
while
at
great
barrington
he
had
himself
owned
a
slave
whom
he
had
sold
on
leaving
the
place
without
compunction
or
suspicion
in
regard
to
the
rightfulness
of
the
transaction
he
now
saw
the
origin
of
the
system
in
its
true
light
he
heard
the
seamen
engaged
in
the
african
trade
tell
of
the
horrible
scenes
of
fire
and
blood
which
they
had
witnessed
and
in
which
they
had
been
actors
he
saw
the
wretches
brought
up
from
their
noisome
and
narrow
prison
their
squalid
countenances
and
skeleton
forms
bearing
fearful
evidence
of
the
suffering
attendant
upon
the
transportation
from
their
native
homes
the
demoralizing
effects
of
slaveholding
everywhere
forced
themselves
upon
his
attention
for
the
evil
had
struck
its
roots
deeply
in
the
community
and
there
were
few
families
into
which
it
had
not
penetrated
the
right
to
deal
in
slaves
and
use
them
as
articles
of
property
was
questioned
by
no
one
men
of
all
professions
clergymen
and
consulted
only
their
interest
and
convenience
as
to
their
purchase
or
sale
the
magnitude
of
the
evil
at
first
appalled
him
he
felt
it
to
be
his
duty
to
condemn
it
but
for
a
time
even
his
strong
spirit
faltered
and
turned
pale
in
contemplation
of
the
consequences
to
be
apprehended
from
an
attack
upon
it
slavery
and
were
at
that
time
the
principal
source
of
wealth
to
the
island
his
own
church
and
congregation
were
personally
interested
in
the
traffic
all
were
implicated
in
its
guilt
he
stood
alone
as
it
were
in
its
condemnation
with
here
and
there
an
exception
all
christendom
maintained
the
rightfulness
of
slavery
no
movement
had
yet
been
made
in
england
against
the
the
decision
of
granville
sharp
somerset
case
had
not
yet
taken
place
the
quakers
even
had
not
at
that
time
redeemed
themselves
from
the
opprobrium
under
these
circumstances
after
a
thorough
examination
of
the
subject
he
resolved
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
to
take
his
stand
openly
and
decidedly
on
the
side
of
humanity
he
prepared
a
sermon
for
the
purpose
and
for
the
first
time
from
a
pulpit
of
new
england
was
heard
an
emphatic
testimony
against
the
sin
of
slavery
in
contrast
with
the
unselfish
and
disinterested
benevolence
which
formed
in
his
mind
the
essential
element
of
christian
holiness
he
held
up
the
act
of
reducing
human
beings
to
the
condition
of
brutes
to
minister
to
the
convenience
the
luxury
and
lusts
of
the
owner
he
had
expected
bitter
complaint
and
opposition
from
his
hearers
but
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
that
in
most
cases
his
sermon
only
excited
astonishment
in
their
minds
that
they
themselves
had
never
before
looked
at
the
subject
in
the
light
in
which
he
presented
it
steadily
and
faithfully
pursuing
the
matter
he
had
the
satisfaction
to
carry
with
him
his
church
and
obtain
from
it
in
the
midst
of
a
slaveholding
and
slavetrading
community
a
resolution
every
way
worthy
of
note
in
this
day
of
cowardly
compromise
with
the
evil
on
the
part
of
our
leading
ecclesiastical
bodies
resolved
that
the
and
the
slavery
of
the
africans
as
it
has
existed
among
us
is
a
gross
violation
of
the
righteousness
and
benevolence
which
are
so
much
inculcated
in
the
gospel
and
therefore
we
will
not
tolerate
it
in
this
church
there
are
few
instances
on
record
of
moral
heroism
superior
to
that
of
samuel
hopkins
in
thus
rebuking
slavery
in
the
time
and
place
of
its
power
honor
to
the
true
man
ever
who
takes
his
life
in
his
hands
and
at
all
hazards
speaks
the
word
which
is
given
him
to
utter
whether
men
will
hear
or
forbear
whether
the
end
thereof
is
to
be
praise
or
censure
gratitude
or
hatred
it
well
may
be
doubted
whether
on
that
sabbath
day
the
angels
of
god
in
their
wide
survey
of
his
universe
looked
upon
a
nobler
spectacle
than
that
of
the
minister
of
newport
rising
up
before
his
slaveholding
congregation
and
demanding
in
the
name
of
the
highest
the
deliverance
of
the
captive
and
the
opening
of
prison
doors
to
them
that
were
bound
hopkins
did
not
confine
his
attention
solely
to
slaveholding
in
his
own
church
and
congregation
he
entered
into
correspondence
with
the
early
abolitionists
of
europe
as
well
as
his
own
country
he
labored
with
his
brethren
in
the
ministry
to
bring
then
to
his
own
view
of
the
great
wrong
of
holding
men
as
slaves
in
a
visit
to
his
early
friend
bellamy
at
bethlehem
who
was
the
owner
of
a
slave
he
pressed
the
subject
kindly
but
earnestly
upon
his
attention
bellamy
urged
the
usual
arguments
in
favor
of
slavery
hopkins
refuted
them
in
the
most
successful
manner
and
called
upon
his
friend
to
do
an
act
of
simple
justice
in
giving
immediate
freedom
to
his
slave
bellamy
thus
hardly
pressed
said
that
the
slave
was
a
most
judicious
and
faithful
fellow
that
in
the
management
of
his
farm
he
could
trust
everything
to
his
discretion
that
he
treated
him
well
and
he
was
so
happy
in
his
service
that
he
would
refuse
his
freedom
if
it
were
offered
him
will
you
said
hopkins
consent
to
his
liberation
if
he
really
desires
it
yes
certainly
said
bellamy
then
let
us
try
him
said
his
guest
the
slave
was
at
work
in
an
adjoining
field
and
at
the
call
of
his
master
came
promptly
to
receive
his
commands
have
you
a
good
master
inquired
hopkins
o
yes
massa
he
berry
good
but
are
you
happy
in
your
present
condition
queried
the
doctor
o
yes
massa
berry
happy
bellamy
here
could
scarcely
suppress
his
exultation
at
what
he
supposed
was
a
complete
triumph
over
his
brother
but
the
pertinacious
guest
continued
his
queries
would
you
not
be
more
happy
if
you
were
free
o
yes
massa
exclaimed
the
negro
his
dark
face
glowing
with
new
life
berry
much
more
happy
to
the
honor
of
bellamy
he
did
not
hesitate
you
have
your
wish
he
said
to
his
servant
from
this
moment
you
are
free
hopkins
was
a
poor
man
but
one
of
his
first
acts
after
becoming
convinced
of
the
wrongfulness
of
slavery
was
to
appropriate
the
very
sum
which
in
the
days
of
his
ignorance
he
had
obtained
as
the
price
of
his
slave
to
the
benevolent
purpose
of
educating
some
pious
colored
men
in
the
town
of
newport
who
were
desirous
of
returning
to
their
native
country
as
missionaries
in
one
instance
he
borrowed
on
his
own
responsibility
the
sum
requisite
to
secure
the
freedom
of
a
slave
in
whom
he
became
interested
one
of
his
theological
pupils
was
newport
gardner
who
twenty
years
after
the
death
of
his
kind
patron
left
boston
as
a
missionary
to
africa
he
was
a
native
african
and
was
held
by
captain
gardner
of
newport
who
allowed
him
to
labor
for
his
own
benefit
whenever
by
extra
diligence
he
could
gain
a
little
time
for
that
purpose
the
poor
fellow
was
in
the
habit
of
laying
up
his
small
earnings
on
these
occasions
in
the
faint
hope
of
one
day
obtaining
thereby
the
freedom
of
himself
and
his
family
but
time
passed
on
and
the
hoard
of
still
looked
sadly
small
he
concluded
to
try
the
efficacy
of
praying
having
gained
a
day
for
himself
by
severe
labor
and
communicating
his
plan
only
to
hopkins
and
two
or
three
other
christian
friends
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
humble
dwelling
and
spent
the
time
in
prayer
for
freedom
towards
the
close
of
the
day
his
master
sent
for
him
he
was
told
that
this
was
his
gained
time
and
that
he
was
engaged
for
himself
no
matter
returned
the
master
i
must
see
him
poor
newport
reluctantly
abandoned
his
supplications
and
came
at
his
master
bidding
when
to
his
astonishment
instead
of
a
reprimand
he
received
a
paper
signed
by
his
master
declaring
him
and
his
family
from
thenceforth
free
he
justly
attributed
this
signal
blessing
to
the
disposer
who
turns
the
hearts
of
men
as
the
rivers
of
water
are
turned
but
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
labors
and
arguments
of
hopkins
with
his
master
were
the
human
instrumentality
in
effecting
it
in
the
year
in
connection
with
ezra
stiles
he
issued
an
appeal
to
the
christian
community
in
behalf
of
a
society
which
he
had
been
instrumental
in
forming
for
the
purpose
of
educating
missionaries
for
africa
in
the
desolate
and
benighted
condition
of
that
unhappy
continent
he
had
become
painfully
interested
by
conversing
with
the
slaves
brought
into
newport
another
appeal
was
made
on
the
subject
in
the
war
of
the
revolution
interrupted
for
a
time
the
philanthropic
plans
of
hopkins
the
beautiful
island
on
which
he
lived
was
at
an
early
period
exposed
to
the
exactions
and
devastations
of
the
enemy
all
who
could
do
so
left
it
for
the
mainland
its
wharves
were
no
longer
thronged
with
merchandise
its
principal
dwellings
stood
empty
the
very
meeting
houses
were
in
a
great
measure
abandoned
hopkins
who
had
taken
the
precaution
at
the
commencement
of
hostilities
to
remove
his
family
to
great
barrington
remained
himself
until
the
year
when
the
british
took
possession
of
the
island
during
the
period
of
its
occupation
he
was
employed
in
preaching
to
destitute
congregations
he
spent
the
summer
of
at
newburyport
where
his
memory
is
still
cherished
by
the
few
of
his
hearers
who
survive
in
the
spring
of
he
returned
to
newport
everything
had
undergone
a
melancholy
change
the
garden
of
new
england
lay
desolate
his
once
prosperous
and
wealthy
church
and
congregation
were
now
poor

of

used
as
a

for
soldiers
pulpit
and

had
been

the
very
bell
had
been
stolen
refusing
with
his
characteristic
denial
of
self
a
call
to
settle
in
a
more
advantageous
position
he
sat
himself
down
once
more
in
the
midst
of
his
reduced
and
impoverished
parishioners
and
with
no
regular
salary
dependent
entirely
on
such
offerings
as
from
time
to
time
were
made
him
he
remained
with
them
until
his
death
in
hopkins
published
his
celebrated
dialogue
concerning
the
slavery
of
the
africans
showing
it
to
be
the
duty
and
interest
of
the
american
states
to
emancipate
all
their
slaves
this
he
dedicated
to
the
continental
congress
the
signers
of
the
declaration
of
independence
it
was
republished
in
by
the
new
york
abolition
society
and
was
widely
circulated
a
few
years
after
on
coming
unexpectedly
into
possession
of
a
few
hundred
dollars
he
devoted
immediately
one
hundred
of
it
to
the
society
for
ameliorating
the
condition
of
the
africans
he
continued
to
preach
until
he
had
reached
his
year
his
last
sermon
was
delivered
on
the
of
the
tenth
month
and
his
death
took
place
in
the
twelfth
month
following
he
died
calmly
in
the
steady
faith
of
one
who
had
long
trusted
all
things
in
the
hand
of
god
the
language
of
my
heart
is
said
he
let
god
be
glorified
by
all
things
and
the
best
interest
of
his
kingdom
promoted
whatever
becomes
of
me
or
my
interest
to
a
young
friend
who
visited
him
three
days
before
his
death
he
said
i
am
feeble
and
can
not
say
much
i
have
said
all
i
can
say
with
my
last
words
i
tell
you
religion
is
the
one
thing
needful
and
now
he
continued
affectionately
pressing
the
hand
of
his
friend
i
am
going
to
die
and
i
am
glad
of
it
many
years
before
an
agreement
had
been
made
between
hopkins
and
his
old
and
tried
friend
hart
of
connecticut
that
when
either
was
called
home
the
survivor
should
preach
the
funeral
sermon
of
the
deceased
the
venerable
hart
accordingly
came
true
to
his
promise
preaching
at
the
funeral
from
the
words
of
elisha
my
father
my
father
the
chariots
of
israel
and
the
horsemen
thereof
in
the
adjoining
his
house
lies
all
that
was
mortal
of
samuel
hopkins
one
of
hopkins
habitual
hearers
and
who
has
borne
grateful
testimony
to
the
beauty
and
holiness
of
his
life
and
conversation
was
william
ellery
channing
widely
as
he
afterwards
diverged
from
the
creed
of
his
early
teacher
it
contained
at
least
one
doctrine
to
the
influence
of
which
the
philanthropic
devotion
of
his
own
life
to
the
welfare
of
man
bears
witness
he
says
himself
that
there
always
seemed
to
him
something
very
noble
in
the
doctrine
of
disinterested
benevolence
the
casting
of
self
aside
and
doing
good
irrespective
of
personal
consequences
in
this
world
or
another
upon
which
hopkins
so
strongly
insisted
as
the
condition
of
holiness
how
widely
apart
as
mere
theologians
stood
hopkins
and
channing
yet
how
harmonious
their
lives
and
practice
both
could
forget
the
poor
interests
of
self
in
view
of
eternal
right
and
universal
humanity
both
could
appreciate
the
saving
truth
that
love
to
god
and
his
creation
is
the
fulfilling
of
the
divine
law
the
idea
of
unselfish
benevolence
which
they
held
in
common
clothed
with
sweetness
and
beauty
the
stern
and
repulsive
features
of
the
theology
of
hopkins
and
infused
a
sublime
spirit
of
and
a
glowing
humanity
into
the
indecisive
and
less
robust
faith
of
charming
what
is
the
lesson
of
this
but
that
christianity
consists
rather
in
the
affections
than
in
the
intellect
that
it
is
a
life
rather
than
a
creed
and
that
they
who
diverge
the
widest
from
each
other
in
speculation
upon
its
doctrines
may
after
all
be
found
working
side
by
side
on
the
common
ground
of
its
practice
we
have
chosen
to
speak
of
hopkins
as
a
philanthropist
rather
than
as
a
theologian
let
those
who
prefer
to
contemplate
the
narrow
sectarian
rather
than
the
universal
man
dwell
upon
his
controversial
works
and
extol
the
ingenuity
and
logical
acumen
with
which
he
defended
his
own
dogmas
and
assailed
those
of
others
we
honor
him
not
as
the
founder
of
a
new
sect
but
as
the
friend
of
all
mankind
the
generous
defender
of
the
poor
and
oppressed
great
as
unquestionably
were
his
powers
of
argument
his
learning
and
skill
in
the
use
of
the
weapons
of
theologic
warfare
these
by
no
means
constitute
his
highest
title
to
respect
and
reverence
as
the
product
of
an
honest
and
earnest
mind
his
doctrinal
dissertations
have
at
least
the
merit
of
sincerity
they
were
put
forth
in
behalf
of
what
he
regarded
as
truth
and
the
success
which
they
met
with
while
it
called
into
exercise
his
profoundest
gratitude
only
served
to
deepen
the
humility
and
of
their
author
as
the
utterance
of
what
a
good
man
believed
and
felt
as
a
part
of
the
history
of
a
life
remarkable
for
its
consecration
to
apprehended
duty
these
writings
can
not
be
without
interest
even
to
those
who
dissent
from
their
arguments
and
deny
their
assumptions
but
in
the
time
now
we
trust
near
at
hand
when
distracted
and
divided
christendom
shall
unite
in
a
new
evangelical
union
in
which
orthodoxy
in
life
and
practice
shall
be
estimated
above
orthodoxy
in
theory
he
will
be
honored
as
a
good
man
rather
than
as
a
successful
as
a
friend
of
the
oppressed
and
the
fearless
rebuker
of
popular
sin
rather
than
as
the
champion
of
a
protracted
sectarian
war
even
now
his
writings
so
popular
in
their
day
are
little
known
the
time
may
come
when
no
pilgrim
of
sectarianism
shall
visit
his
grave
but
his
memory
shall
live
in
the
hearts
of
the
good
and
generous
the
emancipated
slave
shall
kneel
over
his
ashes
and
bless
god
for
the
gift
to
humanity
of
a
life
so
devoted
to
its
welfare
to
him
may
be
applied
the
language
of
one
who
on
the
spot
where
he
labored
and
lay
down
to
rest
while
rejecting
the
doctrinal
views
of
the
theologian
still
cherishes
the
philanthropic
spirit
of
the
man
he
is
not
lost
he
hath
not
passed
away
clouds
earths
may
pass
but
stars
shine
calmly
on
and
he
who
doth
the
will
of
god
for
aye
abideth
when
the
earth
and
heaven
are
gone
alas
that
such
a
heart
is
in
the
grave
thanks
for
the
life
that
now
shall
never
end
weep
and
rejoice
thou
slave
that
hast
both
lost
and
found
so
great

with

ghastly
with
the

the

so
elaborate

as

the
modern

from
their

his
hold
upon
the

is
limited
to
a

which
from
their
very
nature
can
never
become
obsolete
the

belong
to

they
speak

in
tones
of

pity
to
the
hearts
of

have
succeeded

the
judgment
of

i
perceive
he
says
that
most
of
the
doctrinal
controversies
among
protestants
are
far
more
about
equivocal
words
than
matter
experience
since
the
year
to
this
year
hath
loudly
called
me
to
repent
of
my
own
prejudices
sidings
and
censurings
of
causes
and
persons
not
understood
and
of
all
the
miscarriages
of
my
ministry
and

have
been

richard
baxter
was
born
at
the
village
of
eton
constantine
in
he
received
from
officiating
curates
of
the
little
church
such
literary
instruction
as
could
be
given
by
men
who
had
left
the
farmer
flail
the
tailor
thimble
and
the
service
of
strolling
to
perform
church
drudgery
under
the
parish
incumbent
who
was
old
and
blind
at
the
age
of
sixteen
he
was
sent
to
a
school
at
wroxeter
where
he
spent
three
years
to
little
purpose
so
far
as
a
scientific
education
was
concerned
his
teacher
left
him
to
himself
mainly
and
following
the
bent
of
his
mind
even
at
that
early
period
he
abandoned
the
exact
sciences
for
the
perusal
of
such
controversial
and
metaphysical
writings
of
the
schoolmen
as
his
master
library
afforded
the
smattering
of
latin
which
he
acquired
only
served
in
after
years
to
deform
his
treatises
with
barbarous
and
erroneous
citations
as
to
myself
said
he
in
his
letter
written
in
old
age
to
anthony
wood
who
had
inquired
whether
he
was
an
oxonian
graduate
my
faults
are
no
disgrace
to
a
university
for
i
was
of
none
i
have
but
little
but
what
i
had
out
of
books
and
inconsiderable
help
of
country
divines
weakness
and
pain
helped
me
to
study
how
to
die
that
set
me
how
to
live
and
that
on
studying
the
doctrine
from
which
i
must
fetch
my
motives
and
comforts
beginning
with
necessities
i
proceeded
by
degrees
and
am
now
going
to
see
that
for
which
i
have
lived
and
studied
of
the
first
essays
of
the
young
theologian
as
a
preacher
of
the
established
church
his
early
sufferings
from
that
complication
of
diseases
with
which
his
whole
life
was
tormented
of
the
still
keener
afflictions
of
a
mind
whose
entire
outlook
upon
life
and
nature
was
discolored
and
darkened
by
its
disordered
bodily
medium
and
of
the
struggles
between
his
puritan
temperament
and
his
reverence
for
episcopal
formulas
much
might
be
profitably
said
did
the
limits
we
have
assigned
ourselves
admit
nor
can
we
do
more
than
briefly
allude
to
the
religious
doubts
and
difficulties
which
darkened
and
troubled
his
mind
at
an
early
period
he
tells
us
at
length
in
his
life
how
he
struggled
with
these
spiritual
infirmities
and
temptations
the
future
life
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
the
truth
of
the
scriptures
were
by
turns
questioned
i
never
says
he
in
a
letter
to
more
inserted
in
the
had
so
much
ado
to
overcome
a
temptation
as
that
to
the
opinion
of
averroes
that
as
extinguished
candles
go
all
out
in
an
illuminated
air
so
separated
souls
go
all
into
one
common
anima
mundi
and
lose
their
individuation
with
these
and
similar
temptations
baxter
struggled
long
earnestly
and
in
the
end
triumphantly
his
faith
when
once
established
remained
unshaken
to
the
last
and
although
always
solemn
reverential
and
deeply
serious
he
was
never
the
subject
of
religious
melancholy
or
of
that
mournful
depression
of
soul
which
arises
from
despair
of
an
interest
in
the
mercy
and
paternal
love
of
our
common
father
the
great
revolution
found
him
settled
as
a
minister
in
kidderminster
under
the
sanction
of
a
drunken
vicar
who
yielding
to
the
clamor
of
his
more
sober
parishioners
and
his
fear
of
their
appeal
to
the
long
parliament
then
busy
in
its
task
of
abating
church
nuisances
had
agreed
to
give
him
sixty
pounds
per
year
in
the
place
of
a
poor
tippling
curate
notorious
as
a
common
railer
and
pothouse
encumbrance
as
might
have
been
expected
the
sharp
contrast
which
the
earnest
devotional
spirit
and
painful
strictness
of
baxter
presented
to
the
irreverent
license
and
careless
good
humor
of
his
predecessor
by
no
means
commended
him
to
the
favor
of
a
large
class
of
his
parishioners
sabbath
missed
the
rubicund
face
and
maudlin
jollity
of

old

and

disliked
the
new
preacher
rigid
morality
the
better
informed
revolted
at
his
harsh
doctrines
austere
life
and
grave
manner
intense
earnestness
characterized
all
his
efforts
contrasting
human
nature
with
the
infinite
purity
and
holiness
he
was
oppressed
with
the
sense
of
the
loathsomeness
and
deformity
of
sin
and
afflicted
by
the
misery
of
his
separated
from
the
divine
harmony
he
tells
us
that
at
this
period
he
preached
the
terrors
of
the
law
and
the
necessity
of
repentance
rather
than
the
joys
and
consolations
of
the
gospel
upon
which
he
so
loved
to
dwell
in
his
last
years
he
seems
to
have
felt
a
necessity
laid
upon
him
to
startle
men
from
false
hope
and
security
and
to
call
for
holiness
of
life
and
conformity
to
the
divine
will
as
the
only
ground
of
safety
powerful
and
impressive
as
are
the
appeals
and
expostulations
contained
in
his
written
works
they
probably
convey
but
a
faint
idea
of
the
force
and
earnestness
of
those
which
he
poured
forth
from
his
pulpit
as
he
advanced
in
years
these
appeals
were
less
frequently
addressed
to
the
fears
of
his
auditors
for
he
had
learned
to
value
a
calm
and
consistent
life
of
practical
goodness
beyond
any
passionate
exhibition
of
terrors
fervors
and
transports
having
witnessed
in
an
age
of
remarkable
enthusiasm
and
spiritual
awakening
the
ill
effects
of
passional
excitements
and
religious
melancholy
he
endeavored
to
present
cheerful
views
of
christian
life
and
duty
and
made
it
a
special
object
to
repress
morbid
imaginations
and
heal
diseased
consciences
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
no
man
of
his
day
was
more
often
applied
to
for
counsel
and
relief
by
persons
laboring
under
mental
depression
than
himself
he
has
left
behind
him
a
very
curious
and
not
uninstructive
discourse
which
he
entitled
the
cure
of
melancholy
by
faith
and
physick
in
which
he
shows
a
great
degree
of
skill
in
his
morbid
mental
anatomy
he
had
studied
medicine
to
some
extent
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
of
his
parish
and
knew
something
of
the
intimate
relations
and
sympathy
of
the
body
and
mind
he
therefore
did
not
hesitate
to
ascribe
many
of
the
spiritual
complaints
of
his
applicants
to
disordered
bodily
functions
nor
to
prescribe
pills
and
powders
in
the
place
of
scripture
texts
more
than
thirty
years
after
the
commencement
of
his
labors
at
kidderminster
he
thus
writes
i
was
troubled
this
year
with
multitudes
of
melancholy
persons
from
several
places
of
the
land
some
of
high
quality
some
of
low
some
exquisitely
learned
and
some
unlearned
i
know
not
how
it
came
to
pass
but
if
men
fell
melancholy
i
must
hear
from
them
or
see
them
more
than
any
physician
i
knew
he
cautions
against
ascribing
melancholy
phantasms
and
passions
to
the
holy
spirit
warns
the
young
against
licentious
imaginations
and
excitements
and
ends
by
advising
all
to
take
heed
how
they
make
of
religion
a
matter
of
fears
tears
and
scruples
true
religion
he
remarks
doth
principally
consist
in
obedience
love
and
joy
at
this
early
period
of
his
ministry
however
he
had
all
of
intensity
and
fervor
added
to
reasoning
powers
greatly
transcending
those
of
the
revivalist
of
the
next
century
young
in
years
he
was
even
then
old
in
bodily
infirmity
and
mental
experience
believing
himself
the
victim
of
a
mortal
disease
he
lived
and
preached
in
the
constant
prospect
of
death
his
memento
mori
was
in
his
and
sat
by
him
at
his
frugal
meal
the
glory
of
the
world
was
stained
to
his
vision
he
was
blind
to
the
beauty
of
all
its
pleasant
pictures
no
monk
of
mount
athos
or
silent
chartreuse
no
anchorite
of
indian
superstition
ever
more
completely
mortified
the
flesh
or
turned
his
back
more
decidedly
upon
the
good
things
of
this
life
a
solemn
and
funeral
atmosphere
surrounded
him
he
walked
in
the
shadows
of
the
cypress
and
literally
dwelt
among
the
tombs
tortured
by
incessant
pain
he
wrestled
against
its
attendant
languor
and
debility
as
a
sinful
wasting
of
inestimable
time
goaded
himself
to
constant
toil
and
devotional
exercise
and
to
use
his
own
words
stirred
up
his
sluggish
soul
to
speak
to
sinners
with
compassion
as
a
dying
man
to
dying
men
such
entire
consecration
could
not
long
be
without
its
effect
even
upon
the
vicious
rabble
as
baxter
calls
them
his
extraordinary
earnestness
concern
for
the
spiritual
welfare
of
others
his
rigid
life
of
denial
and
sacrifice
if
they
failed
of
bringing
men
to
his
feet
as
penitents
could
not
but
awaken
a
feeling
of
reverence
and
awe
in
kidderminster
as
in
most
other
parishes
of
the
kingdom
there
were
at
this
period
pious
sober
prayerful
people
diligent
readers
of
the
scriptures
who
were
derided
by
their
neighbors
as
puritans
precisians
and
hypocrites
these
were
naturally
drawn
towards
the
new
preacher
and
he
as
naturally
recognized
them
as
honest
seekers
of
the
word
and
way
of
god
intercourse
with
such
men
and
the
perusal
of
the
writings
of
certain
eminent
had
the
effect
to
abate
in
some
degree
his
strong
attachment
to
the
episcopal
formula
and
polity
he
began
to
doubt
the
rightfulness
of
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
in
baptism
and
to
hesitate
about
administering
the
sacrament
to
profane
swearers
and
tipplers
but
while
baxter
in
the
seclusion
of
his
parish
was
painfully
weighing
the
arguments
for
and
against
the
wearing
of
surplices
the
use
of
marriage
rings
and
the
prescribed
gestures
and
genuflections
of
his
order
tithing
with
more
or
less
scruple
of
conscience
the
mint
and
anise
and
cummin
of
pulpit
ceremonials
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
freedom
justice
and
truth
were
claiming
the
attention
of
pym
and
hampden
brook
and
vane
in
the
parliament
house
the
controversy
between
king
and
commons
had
reached
the
point
where
it
could
only
be
decided
by
the
dread
arbitrament
of
battle
the
somewhat
equivocal
position
of
the
kidderminster
preacher
exposed
him
to
the
suspicion
of
the
adherents
of
the
king
and
bishops
the
rabble
at
that
period
sympathizing
with
the
party
of
license
in
morals
and
strictness
in
ceremonials
insulted
and
mocked
him
and
finally
drove
him
from
his
parish
on
the
memorable
of
tenth
month
he
was
invited
to
occupy
a
friend
pulpit
at
alcester
while
preaching
a
low
dull
jarring
roll
as
of
continuous
thunder
sounded
in
his
ears
it
was
the
of
edgehill
the
prelude
to
the
stern
of
revolution
on
the
morrow
baxter
hurried
to
the
scene
of
action
i
was
desirous
he
says
to
see
the
field
i
found
the
earl
of
essex
keeping
the
ground
and
the
king
army
facing
them
on
a
hill
about
a
mile
off
there
were
about
a
thousand
dead
bodies
in
the
field
between
them
turning
from
this
ghastly
survey
the
preacher
mingled
with
the
parliamentary
army
when
finding
the
surgeons
busy
with
the
wounded
he
very
naturally
sought
occasion
for
the
exercise
of
his
own
vocation
as
a
spiritual
practitioner
he
attached
himself
to
the
army
so
far
as
we
can
gather
from
his
own
memoirs
and
the
testimony
of
his
contemporaries
he
was
not
influenced
to
this
step
by
any
of
the
political
motives
which
actuated
the
parliamentary
leaders
he
was
no
revolutionist
he
was
as
blind
and
unquestioning
in
his
reverence
for
the
king
person
and
divine
right
and
as
hearty
in
his
hatred
of
religious
toleration
and
civil
equality
as
any
of
his
clerical
brethren
who
officiated
in
a
similar
capacity
in
the
ranks
of
goring
and
prince
rupert
he
seems
only
to
have
looked
upon
the
soldiers
as
a
new
set
of
parishioners
whom
providence
had
thrown
in
his
way
the
circumstances
of
his
situation
left
him
little
choice
in
the
matter
i
had
he
says
neither
money
nor
friends
i
knew
not
who
would
receive
me
in
a
place
of
safety
nor
had
i
anything
to
satisfy
them
for
diet
and
entertainment
he
accepted
an
offer
to
live
in
the
governor
house
at
coventry
and
preach
to
the
soldiers
of
the
garrison
here
his
skill
in
polemics
was
called
into
requisition
in
an
encounter
with
two
new
england
antinomians
and
a
certain
anabaptist
tailor
who
was
making
more
rents
in
the
garrison
orthodoxy
than
he
mended
in
their
doublets
and
breeches
coventry
seems
at
this
time
to
have
been
the
rendezvous
of
a
large
body
of
clergymen
who
as
baxter
says
were
for
king
and
parliament
men
who
in
their
desire
for
a
more
spiritual
worship
most
unwillingly
found
themselves
classed
with
the
sentries
whom
they
regarded
as
troublers
and
heretics
not
to
be
tolerated
who
thought
the
king
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
papists
and
that
essex
and
cromwell
were
fighting
to
restore
him
and
who
followed
the
parliamentary
forces
to
see
to
it
that
they
were
kept
sound
in
faith
and
free
from
the
heresy
of
which
the
court
accused
them
of
doing
anything
to
overturn
the
order
of
church
and
state
or
of
promoting
any
radical
change
in
the
social
and
political
condition
of
the
people
they
had
no
intention
whatever
they
looked
at
the
events
of
the
time
and
upon
their
duties
in
respect
to
them
not
as
politicians
or
reformers
but
simply
as
ecclesiastics
and
spiritual
teachers
responsible
to
god
for
the
religious
beliefs
and
practices
of
the
people
rather
than
for
their
temporal
welfare
and
happiness
they
were
not
the
men
who
struck
down
the
solemn
and
imposing
prelacy
of
england
and
vindicated
the
divine
right
of
men
to
freedom
by
tossing
the
head
of
an
anointed
tyrant
from
the
scaffold
at
whitehall
it
was
the
schismatics
ranters
and
levellers
the
disputatious
corporals
and
anabaptist
musketeers
the
dread
and
abhorrence
alike
of
prelate
and
presbyter
who
under
the
lead
of
cromwell
ruined
the
great
work
of
time
and
cast
the
kingdoms
old
into
another
mould
the
commonwealth
was
the
work
of
the
laity
the
sturdy
yeomanry
and
fearing
commoners
of
england
the
news
of
the
fight
of
naseby
reaching
coventry
baxter
who
had
friends
in
the
parliamentary
forces
wishing
as
he
says
to
be
assured
of
their
safety
passed
over
to
the
stricken
field
and
spent
a
night
with
them
he
was
afflicted
and
confounded
by
the
information
which
they
gave
him
that
the
victorious
army
was
full
of
schemers
and
levellers
who
were
against
king
and
church
prelacy
and
ritual
and
who
were
for
a
free
commonwealth
and
freedom
of
religious
belief
and
worship
he
was
appalled
to
find
that
the
heresies
of
the
antinomians
arminians
and
anabaptists
had
made
sadder
breaches
in
the
ranks
of
cromwell
than
the
pikes
of
jacob
astley
or
the
daggers
of
the
roysterers
who
followed
the
mad
charge
of
rupert
hastening
back
to
coventry
he
called
together
his
clerical
brethren
and
told
them
the
sad
news
of
the
corruption
of
the
army
after
much
painful
consideration
of
the
matter
it
was
deemed
best
for
baxter
to
enter
cromwell
army
nominally
as
its
chaplain
but
really
as
the
special
representative
of
orthodoxy
in
politics
and
religion
against
the
democratic
weavers
and
prophesying
tailors
who
troubled
it
he
joined
whalley
regiment
and
followed
it
through
many
a
hot
skirmish
and
siege
personal
fear
was
by
no
means
one
of
characteristics
and
he
bore
himself
through
all
with
the
coolness
of
an
old
campaigner
intent
upon
his
single
object
he
sat
unmoved
under
the
hail
of
from
the
walls
of
bristol
confronted
the
culverins
of
sherburne
charged
side
by
side
with
harrison
upon
musketeers
at
langford
and
heard
the
exulting
thanksgiving
of
that
grim
enthusiast
when
with
a
loud
voice
he
broke
forth
in
praises
of
god
as
one
in
rapture
and
marched
bible
in
hand
with
cromwell
himself
to
the
storming
of
so
desperately
defended
by
the
marquis
of
winchester
in
truth
these
storms
of
outward
conflict
were
to
him
of
small
moment
he
was
engaged
in
a
sterner
battle
with
spiritual
principalities
and
powers
struggling
with
satan
himself
in
the
guise
of
political
levellers
and
antinomian
sowers
of
heresy
no
antagonist
was
too
high
and
none
too
low
for
him
distrusting
cromwell
he
sought
to
engage
him
in
a
discussion
of
certain
points
of
abstract
theology
wherein
his
soundness
seemed
questionable
but
the
wary
chief
baffled
off
the
young
disputant
by
tedious
unanswerable
discourses
about
free
grace
which
baxter
admits
were
not
unsavory
to
others
although
the
speaker
himself
had
little
understanding
of
the
matter
at
other
times
he
repelled
his
chaplain
with
unwelcome
jests
and
rough
soldierly
merriment
for
he
had
a
vivacity
hilarity
and
alacrity
as
another
man
hath
when
he
hath
taken
a
cup
too
much
baxter
says
of
him
complainingly
he
would
not
dispute
with
me
at
all
but
in
the
midst
of
such
an
army
he
could
not
lack
abundant
opportunity
for
the
exercise
of
his
peculiar
powers
of
argumentation
at
amersham
he
had
a
sort
of
pitched
battle
with
the
contumacious
soldiers
when
the
public
talking
day
came
says
he
i
took
the
and
pitchford
cornet
and
troopers
took
the
gallery
there
did
the
leader
of
the
chesham
men
begin
and
afterwards
pitchford
soldiers
set
in
and
i
alone
disputed
with
them
from
morning
until
almost
night
for
i
knew
their
trick
that
if
i
had
gone
out
first
they
would
have
prated
what
boasting
words
they
listed
and
made
the
people
believe
that
they
had
baffled
me
or
got
the
best
therefore
i
stayed
it
out
till
they
first
rose
and
went
away
as
usual
in
such
cases
both
parties
claimed
the
victory
baxter
got
thanks
only
from
the
king
adherents
pitchford
troops
and
the
leader
of
the
chesham
men
retired
from
their
hard
day
work
to
enjoy
the
countenance
and
favor
of
cromwell
as
men
after
his
own
heart
faithful
to
the
houses
and
the
word
against
kingcraft
and
prelacy
laughed
at
and
held
at
arm
length
by
cromwell
shunned
by
harrison
and
berry
and
other
chief
officers
opposed
on
all
points
by
shrewd
earnest
men
as
ready
for
polemic
controversy
as
for
battle
with
the
malignants
and
who
set
off
against
his
theological
and
metaphysical
distinctions
their
own
personal
experiences
and
spiritual
exercises
he
had
little
to
encourage
him
in
his
arduous
labors
alone
in
such
a
multitude
flushed
with
victory
and
glowing
with
religious
enthusiasm
he
earnestly
begged
his
brother
ministers
to
come
to
his
aid
if
the
army
said
he
had
only
ministers
enough
who
could
have
done
such
little
as
i
did
all
their
plot
might
have
been
broken
and
king
parliament
and
religion
might
have
been
preserved
but
no
one
volunteered
to
assist
him
and
the
plot
of
revolution
went
on
after
worcester
fight
he
returned
to
coventry
to
make
his
report
to
the
ministers
assembled
there
he
told
them
of
his
labors
and
trials
of
the
growth
of
heresy
and
levelling
principles
in
the
army
and
of
the
evident
design
of
its
leaders
to
pull
down
church
king
and
ministers
he
assured
them
that
the
day
was
at
hand
when
all
who
were
true
to
the
king
parliament
and
religion
should
come
forth
to
oppose
these
leaders
and
draw
away
their
soldiers
from
them
for
himself
he
was
willing
to
go
back
to
the
army
and
labor
there
until
the
crisis
of
which
he
spoke
had
arrived
whereupon
says
he
they
all
voted
me
to
go
yet
longer
fortunately
for
the
cause
of
civil
and
religious
freedom
the
great
body
of
the
ministers
who
disapproved
of
the
ultraism
of
the
victorious
army
and
sympathized
with
the
defeated
king
lacked
the
courage
and
devotedness
of
baxter
had
they
promptly
seconded
his
efforts
although
the
restoration
of
the
king
might
have
been
impossible
at
that
late
period
the
horrors
of
civil
war
must
have
been
greatly
protracted
as
it
was
they
preferred
to
remain
at
home
and
let
baxter
have
the
benefit
of
their
prayers
and
good
wishes
he
returned
to
the
army
with
the
settled
purpose
of
causing
its
defection
from
cromwell
but
by
one
of
those
dispensations
which
the
latter
used
to
call
births
of
providence
he
was
stricken
down
with
severe
sickness
baxter
own
comments
upon
this
passage
in
his
life
are
not
without
interest
he
says
god
prevented
his
purposes
in
his
last
and
chiefest
opposition
to
the
army
that
he
intended
to
take
off
or
seduce
from
their
officers
the
regiment
with
which
he
was
connected
and
then
to
have
tried
his
persuasion
upon
the
others
he
says
he
afterwards
found
that
his
sickness
was
a
mercy
to
himself
for
they
were
so
strong
and
active
and
i
had
been
likely
to
have
had
small
success
in
the
attempt
and
to
have
lost
my
life
among
them
in
their
fury
he
was
right
in
this
last
conjecture
oliver
cromwell
would
have
had
no
scruples
in
making
an
example
of
a
plotting
priest
and
pitchford
soldiers
might
have
been
called
upon
to
silence
with
their
muskets
the
tough
disputant
who
was
proof
against
their
tongues
after
a
long
and
dubious
illness
baxter
was
so
far
restored
as
to
be
able
to
go
back
to
his
old
parish
at
kidderminster
here
under
the
protectorate
of
cromwell
he
remained
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
that
religious
liberty
which
he
still
stoutly
condemned
in
its
application
to
others
he
afterwards
candidly
admits
that
under
the
usurper
as
he
styles
cromwell
he
had
such
liberty
and
advantage
to
preach
the
gospel
with
success
as
he
could
not
have
under
a
king
to
whom
he
had
sworn
and
performed
true
subjection
and
obedience
yet
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
preaching
and
printing
seasonably
and
moderately
against
the
protector
i
declared
said
he
cromwell
and
his
adherents
to
be
guilty
of
treason
and
rebellion
aggravated
by
perfidiousness
and
hypocrisy
but
yet
i
did
not
think
it
my
duty
to
rave
against
him
in
the
pulpit
or
to
do
this
so
unseasonably
and
imprudently
as
might
irritate
him
to
mischief
and
the
rather
because
as
he
kept
up
his
approbation
of
a
godly
life
in
general
and
of
all
that
was
good
except
that
which
the
interest
of
his
sinful
cause
engaged
him
to
be
against
so
i
perceived
that
it
was
his
design
to
do
good
in
the
main
and
to
promote
the
gospel
and
the
interests
of
godliness
more
than
any
had
done
before
him
cromwell
if
he
heard
of
his
diatribes
against
him
appears
to
have
cared
little
for
them
lords
warwick
and
broghill
on
one
occasion
brought
him
to
preach
before
the
lord
protector
he
seized
the
occasion
to
preach
against
the
sentries
to
condemn
all
who
countenanced
them
and
to
advocate
the
unity
of
the
church
soon
after
he
was
sent
for
by
cromwell
who
made
a
long
and
tedious
speech
in
the
presence
of
three
of
his
chief
men
one
of
whom
general
lambert
fell
asleep
the
while
asserting
that
god
had
owned
his
government
in
a
signal
manner
baxter
boldly
replied
to
him
that
he
and
his
friends
regarded
the
ancient
monarchy
as
a
blessing
and
not
an
evil
and
begged
to
know
how
that
blessing
was
forfeited
to
england
and
to
whom
that
forfeiture
was
made
cromwell
with
some
heat
made
answer
that
it
was
no
forfeiture
but
that
god
had
made
the
change
they
afterwards
held
a
long
conference
with
respect
to
freedom
of
conscience
cromwell
defending
his
liberal
policy
and
baxter
opposing
it
no
one
can
read
baxter
own
account
of
these
interviews
without
being
deeply
impressed
with
the
generous
and
magnanimous
spirit
of
the
lord
protector
in
tolerating
the
utmost
freedom
of
speech
on
the
part
of
one
who
openly
denounced
him
as
a
traitor
and
usurper
real
greatness
of
mind
could
alone
have
risen
above
personal
resentment
under
such
circumstances
of
peculiar
aggravation
in
the
death
of
the
protector
the
treachery
of
monk
and
the
restoration
of
the
king
baxter
and
his
presbyterian
friends
believed
that
they
saw
the
hand
of
a
merciful
providence
preparing
the
way
for
the
best
good
of
england
and
the
church
always
royalists
they
had
acted
with
the
party
opposed
to
the
king
from
necessity
rather
than
choice
considering
all
that
followed
one
can
scarcely
avoid
smiling
over
the
extravagant
jubilations
of
the
presbyterian
divines
on
the
return
of
the
royal
debauchee
to
whitehall
they
hurried
up
to
london
with
congratulations
of
formidable
length
and
papers
of
solemn
advice
and
counsel
to
all
which
the
careless
monarch
listened
with
what
patience
he
was
master
of
baxter
was
one
of
the
first
to
present
himself
at
court
and
it
is
creditable
to
his
heart
rather
than
his
judgment
and
discrimination
that
he
seized
the
occasion
to
offer
a
long
address
to
the
king
expressive
of
his
expectation
that
his
majesty
would
discountenance
all
sin
and
promote
godliness
support
the
true
exercise
of
church
discipline
and
cherish
and
hold
up
the
hands
of
the
faithful
ministers
of
the
church
to
all
which
charles
ii
made
as
gracious
an
answer
as
we
could
expect
says
baxter
insomuch
that
old
ash
burst
out
into
tears
of
joy
who
doubts
that
the
profligate
king
avenged
himself
as
soon
as
the
backs
of
his
unwelcome
visitors
were
fairly
turned
by
coarse
jests
and
ribaldry
directed
against
a
class
of
men
whom
he
despised
and
hated
but
towards
whom
reasons
of
policy
dictated
a
show
of
civility
and
kindness
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
charles
had
he
been
able
to
effect
his
purpose
would
have
gone
beyond
cromwell
himself
in
the
matter
of
religious
toleration
in
other
words
he
would
have
taken
in
the
outset
of
his
reign
the
very
steps
which
cost
his
successor
his
crown
and
procured
the
toleration
of
catholics
by
a
declaration
of
universal
freedom
in
religion
but
he
was
not
in
a
situation
to
brave
the
opposition
alike
of
prelacy
and
presbyterianism
and
foiled
in
a
scheme
to
which
he
was
prompted
by
that
vague
superstitious
predilection
for
the
roman
catholic
religion
which
at
times
struggled
with
his
habitual
scepticism
his
next
object
was
to
rid
himself
of
the
importunities
of
sentries
and
the
trouble
of
religious
controversies
by
reestablishing
the
liturgy
and
bribing
or
enforcing
conformity
to
it
on
the
part
of
the
presbyterians
the
history
of
the
successful
execution
of
this
purpose
is
familiar
to
all
the
readers
of
the
plausible
pages
of
clarendon
on
the
one
side
or
the
complaining
treatises
of
neal
and
calamy
on
the
other
charles
and
his
advisers
triumphed
not
so
much
through
their
own
art
dissimulation
and
bad
faith
as
through
the
blind
bigotry
divided
counsels
and
of
the
nonconformists
seduction
on
one
hand
and
threats
on
the
other
the
bribe
of
bishoprics
hatred
of
independents
and
quakers
and
the
terror
of
penal
laws
broke
the
strength
of
presbyterianism
baxter
whole
conduct
on
this
occasion
bears
testimony
to
his
honesty
and
sincerity
while
it
shows
him
to
have
been
too
intolerant
to
secure
his
own
religious
freedom
at
the
price
of
toleration
for
catholics
quakers
and
anabaptists
and
too
blind
in
his
loyalty
to
perceive
that
pure
and
undefiled
christianity
had
nothing
to
hope
for
from
a
scandalous
and
depraved
king
surrounded
by
scoffing
licentious
courtiers
and
a
haughty
revengeful
prelacy
to
secure
his
influence
the
court
offered
him
the
bishopric
of
hereford
superior
to
personal
considerations
he
declined
the
honor
but
somewhat
inconsistently
in
his
zeal
for
the
interests
of
his
party
he
urged
the
elevation
of
at
least
three
of
his
presbyterian
friends
to
the
episcopal
bench
to
enforce
that
very
liturgy
which
they
condemned
he
was
the
chief
speaker
for
the
presbyterians
at
the
famous
savoy
conference
summoned
to
advise
and
consult
upon
the
book
of
common
prayer
his
antagonist
was
gunning
ready
fluent
and
impassioned
they
spent
as
gilbert
burnet
says
several
days
in
logical
arguing
to
the
diversion
of
the
town
who
looked
upon
them
as
a
couple
of
fencers
engaged
in
a
discussion
which
could
not
be
brought
to
an
end
in
themselves
considered
many
of
the
points
at
issue
seem
altogether
too
trivial
for
the
zeal
with
which
baxter
contested
them
the
form
of
a
surplice
the
wording
of
a
prayer
kneeling
at
sacrament
the
sign
of
the
cross
etc
with
him
however
they
were
of
momentous
interest
and
importance
as
things
unlawful
in
the
worship
of
god
he
struggled
desperately
but
unavailingly
presbyterianism
in
its
eagerness
for
peace
and
union
and
a
due
share
of
state
support
had
already
made
fatal
concessions
and
it
was
too
late
to
stand
upon
essentials
baxter
retired
from
the
conference
baffled
and
defeated
amidst
murmurs
and
jests
if
you
had
only
been
as
fat
as
manton
said
clarendon
to
him
you
would
have
done
well
the
act
of
conformity
in
which
charles
ii
and
his
counsellors
gave
the
lie
to
the
liberal
declarations
of
breda
and
whitehall
drove
baxter
from
his
sorrowing
parishioners
of
kidderminster
and
added
the
evils
of
poverty
and
persecution
to
the
painful
bodily
infirmities
under
which
he
was
already
bowed
down
yet
his
cup
was
not
one
of
unalloyed
bitterness
and
loving
lips
were
prepared
to
drink
it
with
him
among
baxter
old
parishioners
of
kidderminster
was
a
widowed
lady
of
gentle
birth
named
charlton
who
with
her
daughter
margaret
occupied
a
house
in
his
neighborhood
the
daughter
was
a
brilliant
girl
of
strangely
vivid
wit
and
in
early
youth
he
tells
us
pride
and
romances
and
company
suitable
thereunto
did
take
her
up
but
erelong
baxter
who
acted
in
the
double
capacity
of
spiritual
and
temporal
physician
was
sent
for
to
visit
her
on
an
occasion
of
sickness
he
ministered
to
her
bodily
and
mental
sufferings
and
thus
secured
her
gratitude
and
confidence
on
her
recovery
under
the
influence
of
his
warnings
and
admonitions
the
gay
young
girl
became
thoughtful
and
serious
abandoned
her
light
books
and
companions
and
devoted
herself
to
the
duties
of
a
christian
profession
baxter
was
her
counsellor
and
confidant
she
disclosed
to
him
all
her
doubts
trials
and
temptations
and
he
in
return
wrote
her
long
letters
of
sympathy
consolation
and
encouragement
he
began
to
feel
such
an
unwonted
interest
in
the
moral
and
spiritual
growth
of
his
young
disciple
that
in
his
daily
walks
among
his
parishioners
he
found
himself
inevitably
drawn
towards
her
mother
dwelling
in
her
presence
the
habitual
austerity
of
his
manner
was
softened
his
cold
close
heart
warmed
and
expanded
he
began
to
repay
her
confidence
with
his
own
disclosing
to
her
all
his
plans
of
benevolence
soliciting
her
services
and
waiting
with
deference
for
her
judgment
upon
them
a
change
came
over
his
habits
of
thought
and
his
literary
tastes
the
harsh
rude
disputant
the
tough
dry
logician
found
himself
addressing
to
his
young
friend
epistles
in
verse
on
doctrinal
points
and
matters
of
casuistry
westminster
catechism
in
rhyme
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
set
to
music
a
miracle
alone
could
have
made
baxter
a
poet
the
cold
clear
light
of
reason
paled
the
ineffectual
fires
of
his
imagination
all
things
presented
themselves
to
his
vision
with
hard
outlines
colorless
and
with
no
surrounding
atmosphere
that
he
did
nevertheless
write
verses
so
creditable
as
to
justify
a
judicious
modern
critic
in
their
citation
and
approval
can
perhaps
be
accounted
for
only
as
one
of
the
phenomena
of
that
subtle
and
transforming
influence
to
which
even
his
stern
nature
was
unconsciously
yielding
baxter
was
in
love
never
did
the
blind
god
try
his
archery
on
a
more
unpromising
subject
baxter
was
nearly
fifty
years
of
age
and
looked
still
older
his
life
had
been
one
long
fast
and
penance
even
in
youth
he
had
never
known
a
schoolboy
love
for
cousin
or
playmate
he
had
resolutely
closed
up
his
heart
against
emotions
which
he
regarded
as
the
allurements
of
time
and
sense
he
had
made
a
merit
of
celibacy
and
written
and
published
against
the
entanglement
of
godly
ministers
in
matrimonial
engagements
and
family
cares
it
is
questionable
whether
he
now
understood
his
own
case
or
attributed
to
its
right
cause
the
peculiar
interest
which
he
felt
in
margaret
charlton
left
to
himself
it
is
more
than
probable
that
he
might
never
have
discovered
the
true
nature
of
that
interest
or
conjectured
that
anything
whatever
of
earthly
passion
or
sublunary
emotion
had
mingled
with
his
spiritual
platonism
commissioned
and
set
apart
to
preach
repentance
to
dying
men
penniless
and
homeless
worn
with
bodily
pain
and
mental
toil
and
treading
as
he
believed
on
the
very
margin
of
his
grave
what
had
he
to
do
with
love
what
power
had
he
to
inspire
that
tender
sentiment
the
appropriate
offspring
only
of
youth
and
health
and
beauty
could
any
beatrice
see
a
lover
in
such
anchorite
but
in
the
mean
time
a
reciprocal
feeling
was
gaining
strength
in
the
heart
of
margaret
to
her
grateful
appreciation
of
the
condescension
of
a
great
and
good
man
grave
learned
and
renowned
to
her
youth
and
weakness
and
to
her
enthusiastic
admiration
of
his
intellectual
powers
devoted
to
the
highest
and
holiest
objects
succeeded
naturally
enough
the
tenderly
suggestive
pity
of
her
woman
heart
as
she
thought
of
his
lonely
home
his
unshared
sorrows
his
lack
of
those
sympathies
and
kindnesses
which
make
tolerable
the
hard
journey
of
life
did
she
not
owe
to
him
under
god
the
salvation
of
body
and
mind
was
he
not
her
truest
and
most
faithful
friend
entering
with
lively
interest
into
all
her
joys
and
sorrows
had
she
not
seen
the
cloud
of
his
habitual
sadness
broken
by
gleams
of
sunny
warmth
and
cheerfulness
as
they
conversed
together
could
she
do
better
than
devote
herself
to
the
pleasing
task
of
making
his
life
happier
of
comforting
him
in
seasons
of
pain
and
weariness
encouraging
him
in
his
vast
labors
and
throwing
over
the
cold
and
hard
austerities
of
his
nature
the
warmth
and
light
of
domestic
affection
pity
reverence
gratitude
and
womanly
tenderness
her
fervid
imagination
and
the
sympathies
of
a
deeply
religious
nature
combined
to
influence
her
decision
disparity
of
age
and
condition
rendered
it
improbable
that
baxter
would
ever
venture
to
address
her
in
any
other
capacity
than
that
of
a
friend
and
teacher
and
it
was
left
to
herself
to
give
the
first
intimation
of
the
possibility
of
a
more
intimate
relation
it
is
easy
to
imagine
with
what
mixed
feelings
of
joy
surprise
and
perplexity
baxter
must
have
received
the
delicate
avowal
there
was
much
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case
to
justify
doubt
misgiving
and
close
searchings
of
heart
he
must
have
felt
the
painful
contrast
which
that
fair
girl
in
the
bloom
of
her
youth
presented
to
the
worn
man
of
middle
years
whose
very
breath
was
suffering
and
over
whom
death
seemed
always
impending
keenly
conscious
of
his
infirmities
of
temper
he
must
have
feared
for
the
happiness
of
a
loving
gentle
being
daily
exposed
to
their
manifestations
from
his
habit
of
consulting
what
he
regarded
as
the
divine
will
in
every
important
step
of
his
life
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
his
decision
was
the
result
quite
as
much
of
a
prayerful
and
patient
consideration
of
duty
as
of
the
promptings
of
his
heart
richard
baxter
was
no
impassioned
abelard
his
pupil
in
the
school
of
his
severe
and
piety
was
no
heloise
but
what
their
union
lacked
in
romantic
interest
was
compensated
by
its
purity
and
disinterestedness
and
its
sanction
by
all
that
can
hallow
human
passion
and
harmonize
the
love
of
the
created
with
the
love
and
service
of
the
creator
although
summoned
by
a
power
which
it
would
have
been
folly
to
resist
the
tough
theologian
did
not
surrender
at
discretion
from
the
first
thoughts
yet
many
changes
and
stoppages
intervened
and
long
delays
he
tells
us
the
terms
upon
which
he
finally
capitulated
are
perfectly
in
keeping
with
his
character
she
consented
he
says
to
three
conditions
of
our
marriage
that
i
should
have
nothing
that
before
our
marriage
was
hers
that
i
who
wanted
no
earthly
supplies
might
not
seem
to
marry
her
from
selfishness
that
she
would
so
alter
her
affairs
that
i
might
be
entangled
in
no
lawsuits
that
she
should
expect
none
of
my
time
which
my
ministerial
work
should
require
as
was
natural
the
wits
of
the
court
had
their
jokes
upon
this
singular
marriage
and
many
of
his
best
friends
regretted
it
when
they
called
to
mind
what
he
had
written
in
favor
of
ministerial
celibacy
at
a
time
when
as
he
says
he
thought
to
live
and
die
a
bachelor
but
baxter
had
no
reason
to
regret
the
inconsistency
of
his
precept
and
example
how
much
of
the
happiness
of
the
next
twenty
years
of
his
life
resulted
from
his
union
with
a
kind
and
affectionate
woman
he
has
himself
testified
in
his
simple
and
touching
breviate
of
the
life
of
the
late
baxter
her
affections
were
so
ardent
that
her
husband
confesses
his
fear
that
he
was
unable
to
make
an
adequate
return
and
that
she
must
have
been
disappointed
in
him
in
consequence
he
extols
her
pleasant
conversation
her
active
benevolence
her
disposition
to
aid
him
in
all
his
labors
and
her
noble
forgetfulness
of
self
in
ministering
to
his
comfort
in
sickness
and
imprisonment
she
was
the
meetest
helper
i
could
have
had
in
the
world
is
his
language
if
i
spoke
harshly
or
sharply
it
offended
her
if
i
carried
it
as
i
am
apt
with
too
much
negligence
of
ceremony
or
humble
compliment
to
any
she
would
modestly
tell
me
of
it
if
my
looks
seemed
not
pleasant
she
would
have
me
amend
them
which
my
weak
pained
state
of
body
indisposed
me
to
do
he
admits
she
had
her
failings
but
taken
as
a
whole
the
breviate
is
an
exalted
eulogy
his
history
from
this
time
is
marked
by
few
incidents
of
a
public
character
during
that
most
disgraceful
period
in
the
annals
of
england
the
reign
of
the
second
charles
his
peculiar
position
exposed
him
to
the
persecutions
of
prelacy
and
the
taunts
and
abuse
of
the
sentries
standing
as
he
did
between
these
extremes
and
pleading
for
a
moderate
episcopacy
he
was
between
the
upper
millstone
of
high
church
and
the
nether
one
of
dissent
to
use
his
own
simile
he
was
like
one
who
seeks
to
fill
with
his
hand
a
cleft
in
a
log
and
feels
both
sides
close
upon
him
with
pain
all
parties
and
sects
had
as
they
thought
grounds
of
complaint
against
him
there
was
in
him
an
almost
childish
simplicity
of
purpose
a
headlong
earnestness
and
eagerness
which
did
not
allow
him
to
consider
how
far
a
present
act
or
opinion
harmonized
with
what
he
had
already
done
or
written
his
greatest
admirers
admit
his
lack
of
judgment
his
inaptitude
for
the
management
of
practical
matters
his
utter
incapacity
to
comprehend
rightly
the
public
men
and
measures
of
his
day
is
abundantly
apparent
and
the
inconsistencies
of
his
conduct
and
his
writings
are
too
marked
to
need
comment
he
suffered
persecution
for
not
conforming
to
some
trifling
matters
of
church
usage
while
he
advocated
the
doctrine
of
passive
obedience
to
the
king
or
ruling
power
and
the
right
of
that
power
to
enforce
conformity
he
wrote
against
conformity
while
himself
conforming
seceded
from
the

and
yet
held
stated
communion
with
it
begged
for
the
curacy
of
kidderminster
and
declined
the
bishopric
of
hereford
his
writings
were
many
of
them
directly
calculated
to
make
dissenters
from
the
establishment
but
he
was
invariably
offended
to
find
others
practically
influenced
by
them
and
quarrelled
with
his
own
converts
to
dissent
the
high
churchmen
of
oxford
burned
his
holy
commonwealth
as
seditious
and
revolutionary
while
harrington
and
the
republican
club
of
miles
coffee
house
condemned
it
for
its
hostility
to
democracy
and
its
servile
doctrine
of
obedience
to
kings
he
made
noble
pleas
for
liberty
of
conscience
and
bitterly
complained
of
his
own
suffering
from
church
courts
yet
maintained
the
necessity
of
enforcing
conformity
and
stoutly
opposed
the
tolerant
doctrines
of
penn
and
milton
never
did
a
great
and
good
man
so
entangle
himself
with
contradictions
and
inconsistencies
the
witty
and
wicked
sir
roger
compiled
from
the
irreconcilable
portions
of
his
works
a
laughable
dialogue
between
richard
and
baxter
the
antinomians
found
him
guilty
of
socinianism
and
one
noted
controversialist
undertook
to
show
not
without
some
degree
of
plausibility
that
he
was
by
turns
a
quaker
and
a
papist
although
able
to
suspend
his
judgment
and
carefully
weigh
evidence
upon
matters
which
he
regarded
as
proper
subjects
of
debate
and
scrutiny
he
possessed
the
power
to
shut
out
and
banish
at
will
all
doubt
and
misgiving
in
respect
to
whatever
tended
to
prove
illustrate
or
enforce
his
settled
opinions
and
cherished
doctrines
his
credulity
at
times
seems
boundless
hating
the
quakers
and
prepared
to
believe
all
manner
of
evil
of
them
he
readily
came
to
the
conclusion
that
their
leaders
were
disguised
papists
he
maintained
that
lauderdale
was
a
good
and
pious
man
in
spite
of
atrocities
in
scotland
which
entitle
him
to
a
place
with
claverhouse
and
indorsed
the
character
of
the
infamous
dangerfield
the
inventor
of
the
plot
as
a
worthy
convert
from
popish
errors
to
prove
the
existence
of
devils
and
spirits
he
collected
the
most
absurd
stories
and
fables
of
soldiers
scared
from
their
posts
at
night
by
headless
bears
of
a
young
witch
pulling
the
hooks
out
of
emlen
breeches
and
swallowing
them
of
beacham
locomotive
and
the
rev
munn
jumping
bible
and
of
a
drunken
man
punished
for
his
intemperance
by
being
lifted
off
his
legs
by
an
invisible
hand
cotton
mather
marvellous
account
of
his
witch
experiments
in
new
england
delighted
him
he
had
it
republished
declaring
that
he
must
be
an
obstinate
sadducee
who
doubted
it
the
married
life
of
baxter
as
might
be
inferred
from
the
state
of
the
times
was
an
unsettled
one
he
first
took
a
house
at
moorfields
then
removed
to
acton
where
he
enjoyed
the
conversation
of
his
neighbor
sir
matthew
hale
from
thence
he
found
refuge
in
rickmansworth
and
after
that
in
divers
other
places
the
women
have
most
of
this
trouble
he
remarks
but
my
wife
easily
bore
it
all
when
unable
to
preach
his
rapid
pen
was
always
busy
huge
folios
of
controversial
and
doctrinal
lore
followed
each
other
in
quick
succession
he
assailed
popery
and
the
establishment
anabaptists
ultra
calvinists
antinomians
fifth
monarchy
men
and
quakers
his
hatred
of
the
latter
was
only
modified
by
his
contempt
he
railed
rather
than
argued
against
the
miserable
creatures
as
he
styled
them
they
in
turn
answered
him
in
like
manner
the
quakers
he
says
in
their
shops
when
i
go
along
london
streets
say
poor
man
thou
art
yet
in
darkness
they
have
oft
come
to
the
congregation
when
i
had
liberty
to
preach
christ
gospel
and
cried
out
against
me
as
a
deceiver
of
the
people
they
have
followed
me
home
crying
out
in
the
streets
day
of
the
lord
is
coming
and
thou
shalt
perish
as
a
deceiver
they
have
stood
in
the
and
under
my
window
year
after
year
crying
to
the
people
heed
of
your
priests
they
deceive
your
souls
and
if
any
one
wore
a
lace
or
neat
clothing
they
cried
out
to
me
are
the
fruits
of
your
ministry
at
rickmansworth
he
found
himself
a
neighbor
of
william
penn
whom
he
calls
the
captain
of
the
quakers
ever
ready
for
battle
baxter
encountered
him
in
a
public
discussion
with
such
fierceness
and
bitterness
as
to
force
from
that
mild
and
amiable
civilian
the
remark
that
he
would
rather
be
socrates
at
the
final
judgment
than
richard
baxter
both
lived
to
know
each
other
better
and
to
entertain
sentiments
of
mutual
esteem
baxter
himself
admits
that
the
quakers
by
their
perseverance
in
holding
their
religious
meetings
in
defiance
of
penal
laws
took
upon
themselves
the
burden
of
persecution
which
would
otherwise
have
fallen
upon
himself
and
his
friends
and
makes
special
mention
of
the
noble
and
successful
plea
of
penn
before
the
court
in
london
based
on
the
fundamental
liberties
of
englishmen
and
the
rights
of
the
great
charter
the
intolerance
of
baxter
towards
the
separatists
was
turned
against
him
whenever
he
appealed
to
the
king
and
parliament
against
the
proscription
of
himself
and
his
friends
they
gathered
he
complains
out
of
mine
and
other
men
books
all
that
we
had
said
against
liberty
for
popery
and
quakers
railing
against
ministers
in
open
congregation
and
applied
it
as
against
the
toleration
of
ourselves
it
was
in
vain
that
he
explained
that
he
was
only
in
favor
of
a
gentle
coercion
of
dissent
a
moderate
enforcement
of
conformity
his
plan
for
dealing
with
sentries
reminds
one
of
old
isaak
walton
direction
to
his
piscatorial
readers
to
impale
the
frog
on
the
hook
as
gently
as
if
they
loved
him
while
at
acton
he
was
complained
of
by
ryves
the
rector
one
of
the
king
chaplains
in
ordinary
for
holding
religious
services
in
his
family
with
more
than
five
strangers
present
he
was
cast
into
clerkenwell
jail
whither
his
faithful
wife
followed
him
on
his
discharge
he
sought
refuge
in
the
hamlet
of
totteridge
where
he
wrote
and
published
that
paraphrase
on
the
new
testament
which
was
made
the
ground
of
his
prosecution
and
trial
before
jeffreys
on
the
of
the
sixth
month
he
was
called
to
endure
the
greatest
affliction
of
his
life
his
wife
died
on
that
day
after
a
brief
illness
she
who
had
been
his
faithful
friend
companion
and
nurse
for
twenty
years
was
called
away
from
him
in
the
time
of
his
greatest
need
of
her
ministrations
he
found
consolation
in
dwelling
on
her
virtues
and
excellences
in
the
breviate
of
her
life
a
paper
monument
he
says
erected
by
one
who
is
following
her
even
at
the
door
in
some
passion
indeed
of
love
and
grief
in
the
preface
to
his
poetical
pieces
he
alludes
to
her
in
terms
of
touching
simplicity
and
tenderness
as
these
pieces
were
mostly
written
in
various
passions
so
passion
hath
now
thrust
them
out
into
the
world
god
having
taken
away
the
dear
companion
of
the
last
nineteen
years
of
my
life
as
her
sorrows
and
sufferings
long
ago
gave
being
to
some
of
these
poems
for
reasons
which
the
world
is
not
concerned
to
know
so
my
grief
for
her
removal
and
the
revival
of
the
sense
of
former
things
have
prevailed
upon
me
to
be
passionate
in
the
sight
of
all
the
circumstances
of
his
trial
before
the
judicial
monster
jeffreys
are
too
well
known
to
justify
their
detail
in
this
sketch
he
was
sentenced
to
pay
a
fine
of
five
hundred
marks
seventy
years
of
age
and
reduced
to
poverty
by
former
persecutions
he
was
conveyed
to
the
king
bench
prison
here
for
two
years
he
lay
a
victim
to
intense
bodily
suffering
when
through
the
influence
of
his
old
antagonist
penn
he
was
restored
to
freedom
he
was
already
a
dying
man
but
he
came
forth
from
prison
as
he
entered
it
unsubdued
in
spirit
urged
to
sign
a
declaration
of
thanks
to
james
his
soul
put
on
the
athletic
habits
of
youth
and
he
stoutly
refused
to
commend
an
act
of
toleration
which
had
given
freedom
not
to
himself
alone
but
to
papists
and
sentries
shaking
off
the
dust
of
the
court
from
his
feet
he
retired
to
a
dwelling
in
square
near
his
friend
sylvester
and
patiently
awaited
his
deliverance
his
death
was
quiet
and
peaceful
i
have
pain
he
said
to
his
friend
mather
there
is
no
arguing
against
sense
but
i
have
peace
i
have
peace
on
being
asked
how
he
did
he
answered
in
memorable
words
almost
well
he
was
buried
in
christ
church
where
the
remains
of
his
wife
and
her
mother
had
been
placed
an
immense
concourse
attended
his
funeral
of
all
ranks
and
parties
conformist
and
forgot
the
bitterness
of
the
controversialist
and
remembered
only
the
virtues
and
the
piety
of
the
man
looking
back
on
his
life
of
and
faithfulness
to
apprehended
duty
the
men
who
had
persecuted
him
while
living
wept
over
his
grave
during
the
last
few
years
of
his
life
the
severity
of
his
controversial
tone
had
been
greatly
softened
he
lamented
his
former
lack
of
charity
the
circle
of
his
sympathies
widened
his
social
affections
grew
stronger
with
age
and
love
for
his
universally
and
irrespective
of
religious
differences
increased
within
him
in
his
narrative
written
in
the
long
cool
shadows
of
the
evening
of
life
he
acknowledges
with
extraordinary
candor
this
change
in
his
views
and
feelings
he
confesses
his
imperfections
as
a
writer
and
public
teacher
i
wish
he
says
all
passages
were
expunged
from
my
writings
and
i
ask
forgiveness
of
god
and
man
he
tells
us
that
mankind
appear
more
equal
to
him
the
good
are
not
so
good
as
he
once
thought
nor
the
bad
so
evil
and
that
in
all
there
is
more
for
grace
to
make
advantage
of
and
more
to
testify
for
god
and
holiness
than
he
once
believed
i
less
admire
he
continues
gifts
of
utterance
and
the
bare
profession
of
religion
than
i
once
did
and
have
now
much
more
charity
for
those
who
by
want
of
gifts
do
make
an
obscurer
profession
he
laments
the
effects
of
his
constitutional
irritability
and
impatience
upon
his
social
intercourse
and
his
domestic
relations
and
that
his
bodily
infirmities
did
not
allow
him
a
free
expression
of
the
tenderness
and
love
of
his
heart
who
does
not
feel
the
pathos
and
inconsolable
regret
which
dictated
the
following
paragraph
when
god
forgiveth
me
i
can
not
forgive
myself
especially
for
my
rash
words
and
deeds
by
which
i
have
seemed
injurious
and
less
tender
and
kind
than
i
should
have
been
to
my
near
and
dear
relations
whose
love
abundantly
obliged
me
when
such
are
dead
though
we
never
differed
in
point
of
interest
or
any
other
matter
every
sour
or
cross
or
provoking
word
which
i
gave
them
maketh
me
almost
irreconcilable
to
myself
and
tells
me
how
repentance
brought
some
of
old
to
pray
to
the
dead
whom
they
had
wronged
to
forgive
them
in
the
hurry
of
their
passion
his
pride
as
a
logician
and
skilful
disputant
abated
in
the
latter
and
better
portion
of
his
life
he
had
more
deference
to
the
judgment
of
others
and
more
distrust
of
his
own
you
admire
said
he
to
a
correspondent
who
had
lauded
his
character
one
you
do
not
know
knowledge
will
cure
your
error
in
his
narrative
he
writes
i
am
much
more
sensible
than
heretofore
of
the
breadth
and
length
and
depth
of
the
radical
universal
odious
sin
of
selfishness
and
therefore
have
written
so
much
against
it
and
of
the
excellency
and
necessity
of
and
of
a
public
mind
and
of
loving
our
neighbors
as
ourselves
against
many
difficulties
and
discouragements
both
within
himself
and
in
his
outward
circumstances
he
strove
to
make
his
life
and
conversation
an
expression
of
that
christian
love
whose
root
as
he
has
said
with
equal
truth
and
beauty
is
set
in
humble
undertrod
while
flower
and
fruit
are
growing
up
to
god
of
the
great
mass
of
his
writings
more
voluminous
than
those
of
any
author
of
his
time
it
would
ill
become
us
to
speak
with
confidence
we
are
familiar
only
with
some
of
the
best
of
his
practical
works
and
our
estimate
of
the
vast
and
appalling
series
of
his
doctrinal
metaphysical
and
controversial
publications
would
be
entitled
to
small
weight
as
the
result
of
very
cursory
examination
many
of
them
relate
to
obsolete
questions
and
issues
monumental
of
controversies
long
dead
and
of
disputatious
doctors
otherwise
forgotten
yet
in
respect
to
even
these
we
feel
justified
in
assenting
to
the
opinion
of
one
abundantly
capable
of
appreciating
the
character
of
baxter
as
a
writer
what
works
of
baxter
shall
i
read
asked
boswell
of
johnson
read
any
of
them
was
the
answer
for
they
are
all
good
he
has
left
upon
all
the
impress
of
his
genius
many
of
them
contain
sentiments
which
happily
find
favor
with
few
in
our
time
philosophical
and
psychological
disquisitions
which
look
oddly
enough
in
the
light
of
the
intellectual
progress
of
nearly
two
centuries
dissertations
upon
evil
spirits
ghosts
and
witches
which
provoke
smiles
at
the
good
man
credulity
but
everywhere
we
find
unmistakable
evidences
of
his
sincerity
and
earnest
love
of
truth
he
wrote
under
a
solemn
impression
of
duty
allowing
neither
pain
nor
weakness
nor
the
claims
of
friendship
nor
the
social
enjoyments
of
domestic
affection
to
interfere
with
his
sleepless
intensity
of
purpose
he
stipulated
with
his
wife
before
marriage
that
she
should
not
expect
him
to
relax
even
for
her
society
the
severity
of
his
labors
he
could
ill
brook
interruption
and
disliked
the
importunity
of
visitors
we
are
afraid
sir
we
break
in
upon
your
time
said
some
of
his
callers
to
him
upon
one
occasion
to
be
sure
you
do
was
his
answer
his
seriousness
seldom
forsook
him
there
is
scarce
a
gleam
of
gayety
in
all
his
one
hundred
and
volumes
he
seems
to
have
relished
however
the
wit
of
others
especially
when
directed
against
what
he
looked
upon
as
error
inimitable
reply
to
the
pretensions
of
parker
fairly
overcame
his
habitual
gravity
and
he
several
times
alludes
to
it
with
marked
satisfaction
but
for
himself
he
had
no
heart
for
pleasentry
his
writings
like
his
sermons
were
the
earnest
expostulations
of
a
dying
man
with
dying
men
he
tells
us
of
no
other
amusement
or
relaxation
than
the
singing
of
psalms
harmony
and
melody
said
he
are
the
pleasure
and
elevation
of
my
soul
it
was
not
the
least
comfort
that
i
had
in
the
converse
of
my
late
dear
wife
that
our
first
act
in
the
morning
and
last
in
bed
at
night
was
a
psalm
of
praise
it
has
been
fashionable
to
speak
of
baxter
as
a
champion
of
civil
and
religious
freedom
he
has
little
claim
to
such
a
reputation
he
was
the
stanch
advocate
of
monarchy
and
of
the
right
and
duty
of
the
state
to
enforce
conformity
to
what
he
regarded
as
the
essentials
of
religious
belief
and
practice
no
one
regards
the
prelates
who
went
to
the
tower
under
james
on
the
ground
of
conscientious
scruples
against
reading
the
king
declaration
of
toleration
to
dissenters
as
martyrs
in
the
cause
of
universal
religious
freedom
nor
can
baxter
although
he
wrote
much
against
the
coercion
and
silencing
of
godly
ministers
and
suffered
imprisonment
himself
for
the
sake
of
a
good
conscience
be
looked
upon
in
the
light
of
an
intelligent
and
consistent
confessor
of
liberty
he
did
not
deny
the
abstract
right
of
ecclesiastical
coercion
but
complained
of
its
exercise
upon
himself
and
his
friends
as
unwarranted
and
unjust
one
of
the
warmest
admirers
and
ablest
commentators
of
baxter
designates
the
leading
and
peculiar
trait
of
his
character
as
unearthliness
in
our
view
this
was
its
radical
defect
he
had
too
little
of
humanity
he
felt
too
little
of
the
attraction
of
this
world
and
lived
too
exclusively
in
the
spiritual
and
the
unearthly
for
a
full
and
healthful
development
of
his
nature
as
a
man
or
of
the
graces
charities
and
loves
of
the
christian
he
undervalued
the
common
blessings
and
joys
of
life
and
closed
his
eyes
and
ears
against
the
beauty
and
harmony
of
outward
nature
humanity
in
itself
considered
seemed
of
small
moment
to
him
passing
away
was
written
alike
on
its
wrongs
and
its
rights
its
pleasures
and
its
pains
death
would
soon
level
all
distinctions
and
the
sorrows
or
the
joys
the
poverty
or
the
riches
the
slavery
or
the
liberty
of
the
brief
day
of
its
probation
seemed
of
too
little
consequence
to
engage
his
attention
and
sympathies
hence
while
he
was
always
ready
to
minister
to
temporal
suffering
wherever
it
came
to
his
notice
he
made
no
efforts
to
remove
its
political
or
social
causes
in
this
respect
he
differed
widely
from
some
of
his
illustrious
contemporaries
penn
while
preaching
up
and
down
the
land
and
writing
theological
folios
and
pamphlets
could
yet
urge
the
political
rights
of
englishmen
mount
the
hustings
for
algernon
sydney
and
plead
for
unlimited
religious
liberty
and
vane
while
dreaming
of
a
coming
millennium
and
reign
of
the
saints
and
busily
occupied
in
defending
his
antinomian
doctrines
could
at
the
same
time
vindicate
with
tongue
and
pen
the
cause
of
civil
and
religious
freedom
but
baxter
overlooked
the
evils
and
oppressions
which
were
around
him
and
forgot
the
necessities
and
duties
of
the
world
of
time
and
sense
in
his
earnest
aspirations
towards
the
world
of
spirits
it
is
by
no
means
an
uninstructive
fact
that
with
the
lapse
of
years
his
zeal
for
proselytism
doctrinal
disputations
and
the
preaching
of
threats
and
terrors
visibly
declined
while
love
for
his
and
catholic
charity
greatly
increased
and
he
was
blessed
with
a
clearer
perception
of
the
truth
that
god
is
best
served
through
his
suffering
children
and
that
love
and
reverence
for
visible
humanity
is
an
indispensable
condition
of
the
appropriate
worship
of
the
unseen
god
but
in
taking
leave
of
richard
baxter
our
last
words
must
not
be
those
of
censure
admiration
and
reverence
become
us
rather
he
was
an
honest
man
so
far
as
we
can
judge
his
motives
were
the
highest
and
best
which
can
influence
human
action
he
had
faults
and
weaknesses
and
committed
grave
errors
but
we
are
constrained
to
believe
that
the
prayer
with
which
he
closes
his
saints
rest
and
which
we
have
chosen
as
the
fitting
termination
of
our
article
was
the
earnest
aspiration
of
his
life
o
merciful
father
of
spirits
suffer
not
the
soul
of
thy
unworthy
servant
to
be
a
stranger
to
the
joys
which
he
describes
to
others
but
keep
me
while
i
remain
on
earth
in
daily
breathing
after
thee
and
in
a
believing
affectionate
walking
with
thee
let
those
who
shall
read
these
pages
not
merely
read
the
fruits
of
my
studies
but
the
breathing
of
my
active
hope
and
love
that
if
my
heart
were
open
to
their
view
they
might
there
read
thy
love
most
deeply
engraven
upon
it
with
a
beam
from
the
face
of
the
son
of
god
and
not
find
vanity
or
lust
or
pride
within
where
the
words
of
life
appear
without
that
so
these
lines
may
not
witness
against
me
but
proceeding
from
the
heart
of
the
writer
be
effectual
through
thy
grace
upon
the
heart
of
the
reader
and
so
be
the
savor
of
life
to
both
william
leggett
o
freedom
thou
art
not
as
poets
dream
a
fair
young
girl
with
light
and
delicate
limbs
and
wavy
tresses
gushing
from
the
cap
with
which
the
roman
master
crowned
his
slave
when
he
took
off
the
gyves
a
bearded
man
armed
to
the
teeth
art
thou
one
mailed
hand
grasps
the
broad
shield
and
one
the
sword
thy
brow
glorious
in
beauty
though
it
be
is
scarred
with
tokens
of
old
wars
thy
massive
limbs
are
strong
with
struggling
power
at
thee
has
launched
his
bolts
and
with
his
lightnings
smitten
thee
they
could
not
quench
the
life
thou
hast
from
heaven
bryant
when
the
noblest
woman
in
all
france
stood
on
the
scaffold
just
before
her
execution
she
is
said
to
have
turned
towards
the
statue
of
liberty
which
strangely
enough
had
been
placed
near
the
guillotine
as
its
patron
saint
with
the
exclamation
o
liberty
what
crimes
have
been
committed
in
thy
name
it
is
with
a
feeling
akin
to
that
which
prompted
this
memorable
exclamation
of
madame
roland
that
the
sincere
lover
of
human
freedom
and
progress
is
often
compelled
to
regard
american
democracy
for
democracy
pure
and
impartial
the
of
the
whole
equal
rights
and
privileges
irrespective
of
birth
or
complexion
the
morality
of
the
gospel
of
christ
applied
to
legislation
christianity
reduced
to
practice
and
showering
the
blessings
of
its
impartial
love
and
equal
protection
upon
all
like
the
rain
and
dews
of
heaven
we
have
the
sincerest
love
and
reverence
so
far
as
our
own
government
approaches
this
standard
and
with
all
its
faults
we
believe
it
does
so
more
nearly
than
any
other
it
has
our
hearty
and
steadfast
allegiance
we
complain
of
and
protest
against
it
only
where
in
its
original
framework
or
actual
administration
it
departs
from
the
democratic
principle
holding
with
novalis
that
the
christian
religion
is
the
root
of
all
democracy
and
the
highest
fact
in
the
rights
of
man
we
regard
the
new
testament
as
the
true
political
and
believe
that
just
in
proportion
as
mankind
receive
its
doctrines
and
precepts
not
merely
as
matters
of
faith
and
relating
to
another
state
of
being
but
as
practical
rules
designed
for
the
regulation
of
the
present
life
as
well
as
the
future
their
institutions
social
arrangements
and
forms
of
government
will
approximate
to
the
democratic
model
we
believe
in
the
ultimate
complete
accomplishment
of
the
mission
of
him
who
came
to
preach
deliverance
to
the
captive
and
the
opening
of
prison
doors
to
them
that
are
bound
we
look
forward
to
the
universal
dominion
of
his
benign
humanity
and
turning
from
the
strife
and
blood
the
slavery
and
social
and
political
wrongs
of
the
past
and
present
anticipate
the
realization
in
the
distant
future
of
that
state
when
the
song
of
the
angels
at
his
advent
shall
be
no
longer
a
prophecy
but
the
jubilant
expression
of
a
glorious
reality
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
peace
on
earth
and
good
will
to
man
for
the
party
in
this
country
which
has
assumed
the
name
of
democracy
as
a
party
we
have
had
we
confess
for
some
years
past
very
little
respect
it
has
advocated
many
salutary
measures
tending
to
equalize
the
advantages
of
trade
and
remove
the
evils
of
special
legislation
but
if
it
has
occasionally
lopped
some
of
the
branches
of
the
evil
tree
of
oppression
so
far
from
striking
at
its
root
it
has
suffered
itself
to
be
made
the
instrument
of
nourishing
and
protecting
it
it
has
allowed
itself
to
be
called
by
its
southern
flatterers
the
natural
ally
of
slavery
it
has
spurned
the
petitions
of
the
people
in
behalf
of
freedom
under
its
feet
in
congress
and
state
legislatures
nominally
the
advocate
of
universal
suffrage
it
has
wrested
from
the
colored
citizens
of
pennsylvania
that
right
of
citizenship
which
they
had
enjoyed
under
a
constitution
framed
by
franklin
and
rush
perhaps
the
most
shameful
exhibition
of
its
spirit
was
made
in
the
late
rhode
island
struggle
when
the
free
suffrage
convention
solemnly
calling
heaven
and
earth
to
witness
its
readiness
to
encounter
all
the
horrors
of
civil
war
in
defence
of
the
holy
principle
of
equal
and
universal
suffrage
deliberately
excluded
colored
rhode
islanders
from
the
privilege
of
voting
in
the
constitutional
conventions
of
michigan
and
iowa
the
same
party
declared
all
men
equal
and
then
provided
an
exception
to
this
rule
in
the
case
of
the
colored
inhabitants
its
course
on
the
question
of
excluding
slavery
from
texas
is
a
matter
of
history
known
and
read
of
all
after
such
exhibitions
of
its
practice
its
professions
have
lost
their
power
the
cant
of
democracy
upon
the
lips
of
men
who
are
living
down
its
principles
is
to
an
earnest
mind
well
nigh
insufferable
pertinent
were
the
queries
of
eliphaz
the
temanite
shall
a
man
utter
vain
knowledge
and
fill
his
belly
with
the
east
wind
shall
he
reason
with
unprofitable
talk
or
with
speeches
wherewith
he
can
do
no
good
enough
of
wearisome
talk
we
have
had
about
progress
the
rights
of
the
masses
the
dignity
of
labor
and
extending
the
area
of
freedom
clear
your
mind
of
cant
sir
said
johnson
to
boswell
and
no
better
advice
could
be
now
given
to
a
class
of
our
democratic
politicians
work
out
your
democracy
translate
your
words
into
deeds
away
with
your
sentimental
generalizations
and
come
down
to
the
practical
details
of
your
duty
as
men
and
christians
what
avail
your
abstract
theories
your
hopeless
virginity
of
democracy
sacred
from
the
violence
of
meanings
a
democracy
which
professes
to
hold
as
by
divine
right
the
doctrine
of
human
equality
in
its
special
keeping
and
which
at
the
same
time
gives
its
direct
countenance
and
support
to
the
vilest
system
of
oppression
on
which
the
sun
of
heaven
looks
has
no
better
title
to
the
name
it
disgraces
than
the
apostate
son
of
the
morning
has
to
his
old
place
in
heaven
we
are
using
strong
language
for
we
feel
strongly
on
this
subject
let
those
whose
hypocrisy
we
condemn
and
whose
sins
against
humanity
we
expose
remember
that
they
are
the
publishers
of
their
own
shame
and
that
they
have
gloried
in
their
apostasy
there
is
a
cutting
severity
in
the
answer
which
sophocles
puts
in
the
mouth
of
electra
in
justification
of
her
indignant
rebuke
of
her
wicked
mother
is
you
that
say
it
not
i
you
do
the
unholy
deeds
which
find
rue
words
yet
in
that
party
calling
itself
democratic
we
rejoice
to
recognize
true
generous
and
thoroughly
sincere
men
lovers
of
the
word
of
democracy
and
doers
of
it
also
honest
and
hearty
in
their
worship
of
liberty
who
are
still
hoping
that
the
antagonism
which
slavery
presents
to
democracy
will
be
perceived
by
the
people
in
spite
of
the
sophistry
and
appeals
to
prejudice
by
which
interested
partisans
have
hitherto
succeeded
in
deceiving
them
we
believe
with
such
that
the
mass
of
the
democratic
voters
of
the
free
states
are
in
reality
friends
of
freedom
and
hate
slavery
in
all
its
forms
and
that
with
a
full
understanding
of
the
matter
they
could
never
consent
to
be
sold
to
presidential
aspirants
by
political
speculators
in
lots
to
suit
purchasers
and
warranted
to
be
useful
in
putting
down
free
discussion
perpetuating
oppression
and
strengthening
the
hands
of
modern
feudalism
they
are
beginning
already
to
see
that
under
the
process
whereby
men
of
easy
virtue
obtain
offices
from
the
general
government
as
the
reward
of
treachery
to
free
principles
the
strength
and
vitality
of
the
party
are
rapidly
declining
to
them
at
least
democracy
means
something
more
than
collectorships
consulates
and
governmental
contracts
for
the
sake
of
securing
a
monopoly
of
these
to
a
few
selfish
and
heartless
party
managers
they
are
not
prepared
to
give
up
the
distinctive
principles
of
democracy
and
substitute
in
their
place
the
doctrines
of
the
satanic
school
of
politics
they
will
not
much
longer
consent
to
stand
before
the
world
as
the
slavery
party
of
the
united
states
especially
when
policy
and
expediency
as
well
as
principle
unite
in
recommending
a
position
more
congenial
to
the
purposes
of
their
organization
the
principles
of
the
fathers
of
their
political
faith
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
the
obligations
of
christianity
the
of
slavery
in
this
country
will
be
given
by
the
very
power
upon
which
it
has
hitherto
relied
with
so
much
confidence
abused
and
insulted
democracy
will
erelong
shake
off
the
loathsome
burden
under
which
it
is
now
staggering
in
the
language
of
the
late
theodore
sedgwiek
of
massachusetts
a
consistent
democrat
of
the
old
school
slavery
in
all
its
forms
is
an
old
poison
left
in
the
veins
fostering
the
worst
principles
of
aristocracy
pride
and
aversion
to
labor
the
natural
enemy
of
the
poor
man
the
laboring
man
the
oppressed
man
the
question
is
whether
absolute
dominion
over
any
creature
in
the
image
of
man
be
a
wholesome
power
in
a
free
country
whether
this
is
a
school
in
which
to
train
the
young
republican
mind
whether
slave
blood
and
free
blood
can
course
healthily
together
in
the
same
body
politic
whatever
may
be
present
appearances
and
by
whatever
name
party
may
choose
to
call
things
this
question
must
finally
be
settled
by
the
democracy
of
the
country
this
prediction
was
made
eight
years
ago
at
a
time
when
all
the
facts
in
the
case
seemed
against
the
probability
of
its
truth
and
when
only
here
and
there
the
voice
of
an
indignant
freeman
protested
against
the
exulting
claims
of
the
slave
power
upon
the
democracy
as
its
natural
ally
the
signs
of
the
times
now
warrant
the
hope
of
its
fulfilment
over
the
hills
of
the
east
and
over
the
broad
territory
of
the
empire
state
a
new
spirit
is
moving
democracy
like
balaam
upon
zophim
has
felt
the
divine
and
is
blessing
that
which
it
was
summoned
to
curse
the
present
hopeful
state
of
things
is
owing
in
no
slight
degree
to
the
exertions
of
a
few
faithful
and
men
foremost
among
whom
was
the
late
william
leggett
than
whom
no
one
has
labored
more
perseveringly
or
in
the
end
more
successfully
to
bring
the
practice
of
american
democracy
into
conformity
with
its
professions
william
leggett
let
our
right
hand
forget
its
cunning
when
that
name
shall
fail
to
awaken
generous
emotions
and
aspirations
for
a
higher
and
worthier
manhood
true
man
and
true
democrat
faithful
always
to
liberty
following
wherever
she
led
whether
the
storm
beat
in
his
face
or
on
his
back
unhesitatingly
counting
her
enemies
his
own
whether
in
the
guise
of
whig
monopoly
and
selfish
expediency

democratic
servility
north

never
stooping
to
flatter

is
the
politician
of
all
others
whom
we
would
hold
up
to
the
admiration
and
imitation
of
the
young

of
our

should
leggett
be
to

his
character
was
formed
on
these
sturdy
democratic
models
had
he
lived
in
their
day
he
would
have
scraped
with
old
andrew
marvell
the
bare
of
poverty
or
even
laid
his
head
on
the
block
with
vane
rather
than
forego
his
independent
thought
and
speech
of
the
early
life
of
william
leggett
we
have
no
very
definite
knowledge
born
in
moderate
circumstances
at
first
a
woodsman
in
the
western
wilderness
then
a
midshipman
in
the
navy
then
a
denizen
of
new
york
exposed
to
sore
hardships
and
perilous
temptations
he
worked
his
way
by
the
force
of
his
genius
to
the
honorable
position
of
associate
editor
of
the
evening
post
the
leading
democratic
journal
of
our
great
commercial
metropolis
here
he
became
early
distinguished
for
his
ultraism
in
democracy
his
whole
soul
revolted
against
oppression
he
was
for
liberty
everywhere
and
in
all
things
in
thought
in
speech
in
vote
in
religion
in
government
and
in
trade
he
was
for
throwing
off
all
restraints
upon
the
right
of
suffrage
regarding
all
men
as
brethren
he
looked
with
disapprobation
upon
attempts
to
exclude
foreigners
from
the
rights
of
citizenship
he
was
for
entire
freedom
of
commerce
he
denounced
a
national
bank
he
took
the
lead
in
opposition
to
the
monopoly
of
incorporated
banks
he
argued
in
favor
of
direct
taxation
and
advocated
a
free
or
a
system
by
which
letters
should
be
transported
as
goods
and
passengers
now
are
by
private
enterprise
in
all
this
he
was
thoroughly
in
earnest
that
he
often
erred
through
passion
and
prejudice
can
not
be
doubted
but
in
no
instance
was
he
found
turning
aside
from
the
path
which
he
believed
to
be
the
true
one
from
merely
selfish
considerations
he
was
honest
alike
to
himself
and
the
public
every
question
which
was
thrown
up
before
him
by
the
waves
of
political
or
moral
agitation
he
measured
by
his
standard
of
right
and
truth
and
condemned
or
advocated
it
in
utter
disregard
of
prevailing
opinions
of
its
effect
upon
his
pecuniary
interest
or
of
his
standing
with
his
party
the
vehemence
of
his
passions
sometimes
betrayed
him
into
violence
of
language
and
injustice
to
his
opponents
but
he
had
that
rare
and
manly
trait
which
enables
its
possessor
whenever
he
becomes
convinced
of
error
to
make
a
prompt
acknowledgment
of
the
conviction
in
the
summer
of
a
series
of
mobs
directed
against
the
abolitionists
who
had
organized
a
national
society
with
the
city
of
new
york
as
its
central
point
followed
each
other
in
rapid
succession
the
houses
of
the
leading
men
in
the
society
were
sacked
and
pillaged
broken
into
and
defaced
and
the
unoffending
colored
inhabitants
of
the
city
treated
with
the
grossest
indignity
and
subjected
in
some
instances
to
shameful
personal
outrage
it
was
emphatically
a
reign
of
terror
the
press
of
both
political
parties
and
of
the
leading
religious
sects
by
appeals
to
prejudice
and
passion
and
by
studied
misrepresentation
of
the
designs
and
measures
of
the
abolitionists
fanned
the
flame
of
excitement
until
the
fury
of
demons
possessed
the
misguided
populace
to
advocate
emancipation
or
defend
those
who
did
so
in
new
york
at
that
period
was
like
preaching
democracy
in
constantinople
or
religious
toleration
in
paris
on
the
eve
of
bartholomew
law
was
prostrated
in
the
dust
to
be
suspected
of
abolitionism
was
to
incur
a
liability
to
an
indefinite
degree
of
insult
and
indignity
and
the
few
and
hunted
friends
of
the
slave
who
in
those
nights
of
terror
laid
their
heads
upon
the
pillow
did
so
with
the
prayer
of
the
psalmist
on
their
lips
defend
me
from
them
that
rise
up
against
me
save
me
from
bloody
men
at
this
period
the
new
york
evening
post
spoke
out
strongly
in
condemnation
of
the
mob
william
leggett
was
not
then
an
abolitionist
he
had
known
nothing
of
the
proscribed
class
save
through
the
cruel
misrepresentations
of
their
enemies
but
true
to
his
democratic
faith
he
maintained
the
right
to
discuss
the
question
of
slavery
the
infection
of
cowardly
fear
which
at
that
time
sealed
the
lips
of
multitudes
who
deplored
the
excesses
of
the
mob
and
sympathized
with
its
victims
never
reached
him
boldly
indignantly
he
demanded
that
the
mob
should
be
put
down
at
once
by
the
civil
authorities
he
declared
the
abolitionists
even
if
guilty
of
all
that
had
been
charged
upon
them
fully
entitled
to
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
american
citizens
he
sternly
reprimanded
the
board
of
aldermen
of
the
city
for
rejecting
with
contempt
the
memorial
of
the
abolitionists
to
that
body
explanatory
of
their
principles
and
the
measures
by
which
they
had
sought
to
disseminate
them
referring
to
the
determination
expressed
by
the
memorialists
in
the
rejected
document
not
to
recant
or
relinquish
any
principle
which
they
had
adopted
but
to
live
and
die
by
their
faith
he
said
in
this
however
mistaken
however
mad
we
may
consider
their
opinions
in
relation
to
the
blacks
what
honest
independent
mind
can
blame
them
where
is
the
man
so
poor
of
soul
so
so
base
that
he
would
do
less
in
relation
to
any
important
doctrine
in
which
he
religiously
believed
where
is
the
man
who
would
have
his
tenets
drubbed
into
him
by
the
clubs
of
ruffians
or
hold
his
conscience
at
the
dictation
of
a
mob
in
the
summer
of
a
mob
of
excited
citizens
broke
open
the
office
at
charleston
south
carolina
and
burnt
in
the
street
such
papers
and
pamphlets
as
they
judged
to
be
incendiary
in
other
words
such
as
advocated
the
application
of
the
democratic
principle
to
the
condition
of
the
slaves
of
the
south
these
papers
were
addressed
not
to
the
slave
but
to
the
master
they
contained
nothing
which
had
not
been
said
and
written
by
southern
men
themselves
the
pinkneys
jeffersons
henrys
and
martins
of
maryland
and
virginia
the
example
set
at
charleston
did
not
lack
imitators
every
petty
postmaster
south
of
mason
and
dixon
line
became
ex
officio
a
censor
of
the
press
the
writing
to
his
subordinate
at
charleston
after
stating
that
the
department
had
no
legal
right
to
exclude
newspapers
from
the
mail
or
prohibit
their
carriage
or
delivery
on
account
of
their
character
or
tendency
real
or
supposed
declared
that
he
would
nevertheless
give
no
aid
directly
or
indirectly
in
circulating
publications
of
an
incendiary
or
inflammatory
character
and
assured
the
perjured
functionary
who
had
violated
his
oath
of
office
that
while
he
could
not
sanction
he
would
not
condemn
his
conduct
against
this
virtual
encouragement
of
a
flagrant
infringement
of
a
constitutional
right
this
licensing
of
thousands
of
petty
government
officials
to
sit
in
their
mail
offices
to
use
the
figure
of
milton
like
so
many
envious
junos
in
judgment
upon
the
daily
offspring
of
the
press
taking
counsel
of
passion
prejudice
and
popular
excitement
as
to
what
was
incendiary
or
inflammatory
the
evening
post
spoke
in
tones
of
manly
protest
while
almost
all
the
editors
of
his
party
throughout
the
country
either
openly
approved
of
the
conduct
of
the
or
silently
acquiesced
in
it
william
leggett
who
in
the
absence
of
his
colleague
was
at
that
time
sole
editor
of
the
post
and
who
had
everything
to
lose
in
a
worldly
point
of
view
by
assailing
a
leading
functionary
of
the
government
who
was
a
favorite
of
the
president
and
a
sharer
of
his
popularity
did
not
hesitate
as
to
the
course
which
consistency
and
duty
required
at
his
hands
he
took
his
stand
for
unpopular
truth
at
a
time
when
a
different
course
on
his
part
could
not
have
failed
to
secure
him
the
favor
and
patronage
of
his
party
in
the
great
struggle
with
the
bank
of
the
united
states
his
services
had
not
been
unappreciated
by
the
president
and
his
friends
without
directly
approving
the
course
of
the
administration
on
the
question
of
the
rights
of
the
abolitionists
by
remaining
silent
in
respect
to
it
he
might
have
avoided
all
suspicion
of
mental
and
moral
independence
incompatible
with
party
allegiance
the
impracticable
honesty
of
leggett
never
bending
from
the
erectness
of
truth
for
the
sake
of
that
thrift
which
follows
fawning
dictated
a
most
severe
and
scorching
review
of
the
letter
of
the
more
monstrous
more
detestable
doctrines
we
have
never
heard
promulgated
he
exclaimed
in
one
of
his
leading
editorials
with
what
face
after
this
can
the
punish
a
postmaster
for
any
exercise
of
the
fearfully
dangerous
power
of
stopping
and
destroying
any
portion
of
the
mails
the
abolitionists
do
not
deserve
to
be
placed
on
the
same
footing
with
a
foreign
enemy
nor
their
publications
as
the
secret
despatches
of
a
spy
they
are
american
citizens
in
the
exercise
of
their
undoubted
right
of
citizenship
and
however
erroneous
their
views
however
fanatic
their
conduct
while
they
act
within
the
limits
of
the
law
what
official
functionary
be
he
merely
a
subordinate
or
the
head
of
the
department
shall
dare
to
abridge
them
of
their
rights
as
citizens
and
deny
them
those
facilities
of
intercourse
which
were
instituted
for
the
equal
accommodation
of
all
if
the
american
people
will
submit
to
this
let
us
expunge
all
written
codes
and
resolve
society
into
its
original
elements
where
the
might
of
the
strong
is
better
than
the
right
of
the
weak
a
few
days
after
the
publication
of
this
manly
rebuke
he
wrote
an
indignantly
sarcastic
article
upon
the
mobs
which
were
at
this
time
everywhere
summoned
to
put
down
the
abolitionists
the
next
day
the
of
the
ninth
month
he
received
a
copy
of
the
address
of
the
american
society
to
the
public
containing
a
full
and
explicit
avowal
of
all
the
principles
and
designs
of
the
association
he
gave
it
a
candid
perusal
weighed
its
arguments
compared
its
doctrines
with
those
at
the
foundation
of
his
own
political
faith
and
rose
up
from
its
examination
an
abolitionist
he
saw
that
he
himself
misled
by
the
popular
clamor
had
done
injustice
to
benevolent
and
men
and
he
took
the
earliest
occasion
in
an
article
of
great
power
and
eloquence
to
make
the
amplest
atonement
he
declared
his
entire
concurrence
with
the
views
of
the
american
society
with
the
single
exception
of
a
doubt
which
rested
on
his
mind
as
to
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
we
quote
from
the
concluding
paragraph
of
this
article
we
assert
without
hesitation
that
if
we
possessed
the
right
we
should
not
scruple
to
exercise
it
for
the
speedy
annihilation
of
servitude
and
chains
the
impression
made
in
boyhood
by
the
glorious
exclamation
of
cato
day
an
hour
of
virtuous
liberty
is
worth
a
whole
eternity
of
bondage
has
been
worn
deeper
not
effaced
by
time
and
we
eagerly
and
ardently
trust
that
the
day
will
yet
arrive
when
the
clank
of
the
fetters
will
form
no
part
of
the
multitudinous
sounds
which
our
country
sends
up
to
heaven
mingling
as
it
were
into
a
song
of
praise
for
our
national
prosperity
we
yearn
with
strong
desire
for
the
day
when
freedom
shall
no
longer
wave
her
fustian
flag
in
mockery
over
slaves
a
few
days
after
in
reply
to
the
assaults
made
upon
him
from
all
quarters
he
calmly
and
firmly
reiterated
his
determination
to
maintain
the
right
of
free
discussion
of
the
subject
of
slavery
the
course
we
are
pursuing
said
he
is
one
which
we
entered
upon
after
mature
deliberation
and
we
are
not
to
be
turned
from
it
by
a
species
of
opposition
the
inefficacy
of
which
we
have
seen
displayed
in
so
many
former
instances
it
is
philip
van
artevelde
who
says
my
life
long
i
have
beheld
with
most
respect
the
man
who
knew
himself
and
knew
the
ways
before
him
and
from
among
them
chose
considerately
with
a
clear
foresight
not
a
blindfold
courage
and
having
chosen
with
a
steadfast
mind
pursued
his
purpose
this
is
the
sort
of
character
we
emulate
if
to
believe
slavery
a
deplorable
evil
and
curse
in
whatever
light
it
is
viewed
if
to
yearn
for
the
day
which
shall
break
the
fetters
of
three
millions
of
human
beings
and
restore
to
them
their
birthright
of
equal
freedom
if
to
be
willing
in
season
and
out
of
season
to
do
all
in
our
power
to
promote
so
desirable
a
result
by
all
means
not
inconsistent
with
higher
duty
if
these
sentiments
constitute
us
abolitionists
then
are
we
such
and
glory
in
the
name
the
senseless
cry
of
shall
never
deter
us
nor
the
more
senseless
attempt
of
puny
prints
to
read
us
out
of
the
democratic
party
the
and
beautiful
saying
of
the
latin
historian
homo
sum
humani
nihil
a
me
alienum
puto
we
apply
to
the
poor
slave
as
well
as
his
master
and
shall
endeavor
to
fulfil
towards
both
the
obligations
of
an
equal
humanity
the
generation
which
since
the
period
of
which
we
are
speaking
have
risen
into
active
life
can
have
but
a
faint
conception
of
the
boldness
of
this
movement
on
the
part
of
william
leggett
to
be
an
abolitionist
then
was
to
abandon
all
hope
of
political
preferment
or
party
favor
to
be
marked
and
branded
as
a
social
outlaw
under
good
society
interdict
of
food
and
fire
to
hold
property
liberty
and
life
itself
at
the
mercy
of
lawless
mobs
all
this
william
leggett
clearly
saw
he
knew
how
rugged
and
thorny
was
the
path
upon
which
impelled
by
his
love
of
truth
and
the
obligations
of
humanity
he
was
entering
from
hunted
and
proscribed
abolitionists
and
oppressed
and
colored
men
the
pariahs
of
american
democracy
he
could
alone
expect
sympathy
the
whig
journals
with
a
few
honorable
exceptions
exulted
over
what
they
regarded
as
the
fall
of
a
formidable
opponent
and
after
painting
his
abolitionism
in
the
most
hideous
colors
held
him
up
to
their
southern
allies
as
a
specimen
of
the
radical
disorganizers
and
democratic
levellers
of
the
north
his
own
party
in
consequence
made
haste
to
proscribe
him
government
advertising
was
promptly
withdrawn
from
his
paper
the
official
journals
of
washington
and
albany
read
him
out
of
the
pale
of
democracy
father
ritchie
scolded
and
threatened
the
democratic
committee
issued
its
bull
against
him
from
tammany
hall
the
resolutions
of
that
committee
were
laid
before
him
when
he
was
sinking
under
a
severe
illness
rallying
his
energies
he
dictated
from
his
an
answer
marked
by
all
his
accustomed
vigor
and
boldness
its
tone
was
calm
manly
the
language
of
one
who
having
planted
his
feet
hard
down
on
the
rock
of
principle
stood
there
like
luther
at
worms
because
he
could
not
otherwise
exhausted
nature
sunk
under
the
effort
a
weary
sickness
of
nearly
a
year
duration
followed
in
this
sore
affliction
deserted
as
he
was
by
most
of
his
old
political
friends
we
have
reason
to
know
that
he
was
cheered
by
the
gratitude
of
those
in
whose
behalf
he
had
made
a
martyr
sacrifice
and
that
from
the
humble
hearths
of
his
poor
colored
fervent
prayers
went
up
for
his
restoration
his
work
was
not
yet
done
purified
by
trial
he
was
to
stand
forth
once
more
in
vindication
of
the
truths
of
freedom
as
soon
as
his
health
was
sufficiently
reestablished
he
commenced
the
publication
of
an
independent
political
and
literary
journal
under
the
expressive
title
of
the
plaindealer
in
his
first
number
he
stated
that
claiming
the
right
of
absolute
freedom
of
discussion
he
should
exercise
it
with
no
other
limitations
than
those
of
his
own
judgment
a
poor
man
he
admitted
that
he
established
the
paper
in
the
expectation
of
deriving
from
it
a
livelihood
but
that
even
for
that
object
he
could
not
trim
its
sails
to
suit
the
varying
breeze
of
popular
prejudice
if
said
he
a
paper
which
makes
the
right
and
not
the
expedient
its
cardinal
object
will
not
yield
its
conductor
a
support
there
are
honest
vocations
that
will
and
better
the
humblest
of
them
than
to
be
seated
at
the
head
of
an
influential
press
if
its
influence
is
not
exerted
to
promote
the
cause
of
truth
he
was
true
to
his
promise
the
free
soul
of
a
free
strong
man
spoke
out
in
his
paper
how
refreshing
was
it
after
listening
to
the
inanities
the
dull
witless
vulgarity
the
wearisome
commonplace
of
journalists
who
had
no
higher
aim
than
to
echo
with
exactness
current
prejudices
and
falsehoods
to
turn
to
the
great
and
generous
thoughts
the
chaste
and
vigorous
diction
of
the
plaindealer
no
man
ever
had
a
clearer
idea
of
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
a
conductor
of
the
public
press
than
william
leggett
and
few
have
ever
combined
so
many
of
the
qualifications
for
their
perfect
discharge
a
nice
sense
of
justice
a
warm
benevolence
inflexible
truth
honesty
defying
temptation
a
mind
stored
with
learning
and
having
at
command
the
treasures
of
the
best
thoughts
of
the
best
authors
as
was
said
of
fletcher
of
saltoun
he
was
a
gentleman
steady
in
his
principles
of
nice
honor
abundance
of
learning
bold
as
a
lion
a
sure
friend
a
man
who
would
lose
his
life
to
serve
his
country
and
would
not
do
a
base
thing
to
save
it
he
had
his
faults
his
positive
convictions
sometimes
took
the
shape
of
a
proud
and
obstinate
dogmatism
he
who
could
so
well
appeal
to
the
judgment
and
the
reason
of
his
readers
too
often
only
roused
their
passions
by
invective
and
vehement
declamation
moderate
men
were
startled
and
pained
by
the
fierce
energy
of
his
language
and
he
not
unfrequently
made
implacable
enemies
of
opponents
whom
he
might
have
conciliated
and
won
over
by
mild
expostulation
and
patient
explanation
it
must
be
urged
in
extenuation
that
as
the
champion
of
unpopular
truths
he
was
assailed
unfairly
on
all
sides
and
indecently
misrepresented
and
calumniated
to
a
degree
as
his
friend
sedgwick
justly
remarks
unprecedented
even
in
the
annals
of
the
american
press
and
that
his
errors
in
this
respect
were
in
the
main
errors
of
retaliation
in
the
plaindealer
in
common
with
the
leading
moral
and
political
subjects
of
the
day
that
of
slavery
was
freely
discussed
in
all
its
bearings
it
is
difficult
in
a
single
extract
to
convey
an
adequate
idea
of
the
character
of
the
editorial
columns
of
a
paper
where
terse
and
concentrated
irony
and
sarcasm
alternate
with
eloquent
appeal
and
diffuse
commentary
and
labored
argument
we
can
only
offer
at
random
the
following
passages
from
a
long
review
of
a
speech
of
john
calhoun
in
which
that
extraordinary
man
whose
giant
intellect
has
been
shut
out
of
its
appropriate
field
of
exercise
by
the
very
slavery
of
which
he
is
the
champion
undertook
to
maintain
in
reply
to
a
virginia
senator
that
chattel
slavery
was
not
an
evil
but
a
great
good
we
have
calhoun
own
warrant
for
attacking
his
position
with
all
the
fervor
which
a
high
sense
of
duty
can
give
for
we
do
hold
from
the
bottom
of
our
soul
that
slavery
is
an
evil
a
deep
detestable
damnable
evil
evil
in
all
its
aspects
to
the
blacks
and
a
greater
evil
to
the
whites
an
evil
moral
social
and
political
an
evil
which
shows
itself
in
the
languishing
condition
of
agriculture
where
it
exists
in
paralyzed
commerce
and
in
the
prostration
of
the
mechanic
arts
an
evil
which
stares
you
in
the
face
from
uncultivated
fields
and
howls
in
your
ears
through
tangled
swamps
and
morasses
slavery
is
such
an
evil
that
it
withers
what
it
touches
where
it
is
once
securely
established
the
land
becomes
desolate
as
the
tree
inevitably
perishes
which
the
chooses
for
its
nest
while
freedom
on
the
contrary
flourishes
like
the
tannen
the
loftiest
and
least
sheltered
rocks
and
clothes
with
its
refreshing
verdure
what
without
it
would
frown
in
naked
and
incurable
sterility
if
any
one
desires
an
illustration
of
the
opposite
influences
of
slavery
and
freedom
let
him
look
at
the
two
sister
states
of
kentucky
and
ohio
alike
in
soil
and
climate
and
divided
only
by
a
river
whose
translucent
waters
reveal
through
nearly
the
whole
breadth
the
sandy
bottom
over
which
they
sparkle
how
different
are
they
in
all
the
respects
over
which
man
has
control
on
the
one
hand
the
air
is
vocal
with
the
mingled
tumult
of
a
vast
and
prosperous
population
every
hillside
smiles
with
an
abundant
harvest
every
valley
shelters
a
thriving
village
the
click
of
a
busy
mill
drowns
the
prattle
of
every
rivulet
and
all
the
multitudinous
sounds
of
business
denote
happy
activity
in
every
branch
of
social
occupation
this
is
the
state
which
but
a
few
years
ago
slept
in
the
unbroken
solitude
of
nature
the
forest
spread
an
interminable
canopy
of
shade
over
the
dark
soil
on
which
the
fat
and
useless
vegetation
rotted
at
ease
and
through
the
dusky
vistas
of
the
wood
only
savage
beasts
and
more
savage
men
prowled
in
quest
of
prey
the
whole
land
now
blossoms
like
a
garden
the
tall
and
interlacing
trees
have
unlocked
their
hold
and
bowed
before
the
woodman
axe
the
soil
is
disencumbered
of
the
mossy
trunks
which
had
reposed
upon
it
for
ages
the
rivers
flash
in
the
sunlight
and
the
fields
smile
with
waving
harvests
this
is
ohio
and
this
is
what
freedom
has
done
for
it
now
let
us
turn
to
kentucky
and
note
the
opposite
influences
of
slavery
a
narrow
and
unfrequented
path
through
the
close
and
sultry
canebrake
conducts
us
to
a
wretched
hovel
it
stands
in
the
midst
of
an
unweeded
field
whose
dilapidated
enclosure
scarcely
protects
it
from
the
lowing
and
hungry
kine
children
half
clad
and
squalid
and
destitute
of
the
buoyancy
natural
to
their
age
lounge
in
the
sunshine
while
their
parent
saunters
apart
to
watch
his
languid
slaves
drive
the
appointed
team
afield
this
is
not
a
fancy
picture
it
is
a
true
copy
of
one
of
the
features
which
make
up
the
aspect
the
state
and
of
every
state
where
the
moral
leprosy
of
slavery
covers
the
people
with
its
noisome
scales
a
deadening
lethargy
benumbs
the
limbs
of
the
body
politic
a
stupor
settles
on
the
arts
of
life
agriculture
reluctantly
drags
the
plough
and
harrow
to
the
field
only
when
scourged
by
necessity
the
axe
drops
from
the
woodman
nerveless
hand
the
moment
his
fire
is
scantily
supplied
with
fuel
and
the
fen
undrained
sends
up
its
noxious
exhalations
to
rack
with
cramps
and
agues
the
frame
already
too
much
enervated
by
a
moral
epidemic
to
creep
beyond
the
sphere
of
the
material
miasm
the
plaindealer
was
uniformly
conducted
with
eminent
ability
but
its
editor
was
too
far
in
advance
of
his
contemporaries
to
find
general
acceptance
or
even
toleration
in
addition
to
pecuniary
embarrassments
his
health
once
more
failed
and
in
the
autumn
of
he
was
compelled
to
suspend
the
publication
of
his
paper
one
of
the
last
articles
which
he
wrote
for
it
shows
the
extent
to
which
he
was
sometimes
carried
by
the
intensity
and
depth
of
his
abhorrence
of
oppression
and
the
fervency
of
his
adoration
of
liberty
speaking
of
the
liability
of
being
called
upon
to
aid
the
master
in
the
subjection
of
revolted
slaves
and
in
replacing
their
fetters
he
thus
expresses
himself
would
we
comply
with
such
a
requisition
no
rather
would
we
see
our
right
arm
lopped
from
our
body
and
the
mutilated
trunk
itself
gored
with
mortal
wounds
than
raise
a
finger
in
opposition
to
men
struggling
in
the
holy
cause
of
freedom
the
obligations
of
citizenship
are
strong
but
those
of
justice
humanity
and
religion
stronger
we
earnestly
trust
that
the
great
contest
of
opinion
which
is
now
going
on
in
this
country
may
terminate
in
the
enfranchisement
of
the
slaves
without
recourse
to
the
strife
of
blood
but
should
the
oppressed
bondmen
impatient
of
the
tardy
progress
of
truth
urged
only
in
discussion
attempt
to
burst
their
chains
by
a
more
violent
and
shorter
process
they
should
never
encounter
our
arm
nor
hear
our
voice
in
the
ranks
of
their
opponents
we
should
stand
a
sad
spectator
of
the
conflict
and
whatever
commiseration
we
might
feel
for
the
discomfiture
of
the
oppressors
we
should
pray
that
the
battle
might
end
in
giving
freedom
to
the
oppressed
with
the
plain
dealer
his
connection
with
the
public
in
a
great
measure
ceased
his
steady
and
intimate
friend
personal
as
well
as
political
theodore
sedgwick
a
gentleman
who
has
on
many
occasions
proved
himself
worthy
of
his
ancestry
thus
speaks
of
him
in
his
private
life
at
this
period
amid
the
reverses
of
fortune
harassed
by
pecuniary
embarrassments
during
the
tortures
of
a
disease
which
tore
away
his
life
piecemeal
hee
ever
maintained
the
same
manly
and
unaltered
front
the
same
cheerfulness
of
disposition
the
same
dignity
of
conduct
no
humiliating
solicitation
no
weak
complaint
escaped
him
at
the
election
in
the
fall
of
the
democrat
was
not
wholly
forgotten
a
strenuous
effort
which
was
nigh
successful
was
made
to
secure
his
nomination
as
a
candidate
for
congress
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
he
wrote
to
a
friend
in
the
city
from
his
residence
at
new
rochelle
one
of
the
noblest
letters
ever
penned
by
a
candidate
for
popular
favor
the
following
extracts
will
show
how
a
true
man
can
meet
the
temptations
of
political
life
what
i
am
most
afraid
of
is
that
some
of
my
friends
in
their
too
earnest
zeal
will
place
me
in
a
false
position
on
the
subject
of
slavery
i
am
an
abolitionist
i
hate
slavery
in
all
its
forms
degrees
and
influences
and
i
deem
myself
bound
by
the
highest
moral
and
political
obligations
not
to
let
that
sentiment
of
hate
lie
dormant
and
smouldering
in
my
own
breast
but
to
give
it
free
vent
and
let
it
blaze
forth
that
it
may
kindle
equal
ardor
through
the
whole
sphere
of
my
influence
i
would
not
have
this
fact
disguised
or
mystified
for
any
office
the
people
have
it
in
their
power
to
give
rather
a
thousand
times
rather
would
i
again
meet
the
denunciations
of
tammany
hall
and
be
stigmatized
with
all
the
foul
epithets
with
which
the
vocabulary
abounds
than
recall
or
deny
one
tittle
of
my
creed
abolition
is
in
my
sense
a
necessary
and
a
glorious
part
of
democracy
and
i
hold
the
right
and
duty
to
discuss
the
subject
of
slavery
and
to
expose
its
hideous
evils
in
all
their
bearings
moral
social
and
political
as
of
infinitely
higher
importance
than
to
carry
fifty
treasury
bills
that
i
should
discharge
this
duty
temperately
that
i
should
not
let
it
come
in
collision
with
other
duties
that
i
should
not
let
my
hatred
of
slavery
transcend
the
express
obligations
of
the
constitution
or
violate
its
clear
spirit
i
hope
and
trust
you
think
sufficiently
well
of
me
to
believe
but
what
i
fear
is
not
from
you
however
that
some
of
my
advocates
and
champions
will
seek
to
recommend
me
to
popular
support
by
representing
me
as
not
an
abolitionist
which
is
false
all
that
i
have
written
gives
the
lie
to
it
all
i
shall
write
will
give
the
lie
to
it
and
here
let
me
add
apart
from
any
consideration
already
adverted
to
that
as
a
matter
of
mere
policy
i
would
not
if
i
could
have
my
name
disjoined
from
abolitionism
to
be
an
abolitionist
now
is
to
be
an
incendiary
as
three
years
ago
to
be
an
was
to
be
a
leveller
and
a
jack
cade
see
what
three
short
years
have
done
in
effecting
the
reform
and
depend
upon
it
that
the
next
three
years
or
if
not
three
say
three
times
three
if
you
please
will
work
a
greater
revolution
on
the
slavery
question
the
stream
of
public
opinion
now
sets
against
us
but
it
is
about
to
turn
and
the
regurgitation
will
be
tremendous
proud
in
that
day
may
well
be
the
man
who
can
float
in
triumph
on
the
first
refluent
wave
swept
onward
by
the
deluge
which
he
himself
in
advance
of
his
fellows
has
largely
shared
in
occasioning
such
be
my
fate
and
living
or
dead
it
will
in
some
measure
be
mine
i
have
written
my
name
in
ineffaceable
letters
on
the
abolition
record
and
whether
the
reward
ultimately
come
in
the
shape
of
honors
to
the
living
man
or
a
tribute
to
the
memory
of
a
departed
one
i
would
not
forfeit
my
right
to
it
for
as
many
offices
as
has
in
his
gift
if
each
of
them
was
greater
than
his
own
after
mentioning
that
he
had
understood
that
some
of
his
friends
had
endeavored
to
propitiate
popular
prejudice
by
representing
him
as
no
abolitionist
he
says
keep
them
for
god
sake
from
committing
any
such
fooleries
for
the
sake
of
getting
me
into
congress
let
others
twist
themselves
into
what
shapes
they
please
to
gratify
the
present
taste
of
the
people
as
for
me
i
am
not
formed
of
such
pliant
materials
and
choose
to
retain
undisturbed
the
image
of
my
god
i
do
not
wish
to
cheat
the
people
of
their
votes
i
would
not
get
their
support
any
more
than
their
money
under
false
pretences
i
am
what
i
am
and
if
that
does
not
suit
them
i
am
content
to
stay
at
home
god
be
praised
for
affording
us
even
in
these
latter
days
the
sight
of
an
honest
man
amidst
the
heartlessness
the
the
evasions
the
prevarications
the
shameful
treachery
and
falsehood
of
political
men
of
both
parties
in
respect
to
the
question
of
slavery
how
refreshing
is
it
to
listen
to
words
like
these
they
renew
our
failing
faith
in
human
nature
they
reprove
our
weak
misgivings
we
rise
up
from
their
perusal
stronger
and
healthier
with
something
of
the
spirit
which
dictated
them
we
renew
our
vows
to
freedom
and
with
manlier
energy
gird
up
our
souls
for
the
stern
struggle
before
us
as
might
have
been
expected
and
as
he
himself
predicted
the
efforts
of
his
friends
to
procure
his
nomination
failed
but
the
same
generous
appreciators
of
his
rare
worth
were
soon
after
more
successful
in
their
exertions
in
his
behalf
he
received
from
president
van
buren
the
appointment
of
the
mission
to
guatemala
an
appointment
which
in
addition
to
honorable
employment
in
the
service
of
his
country
promised
him
the
advantages
of
a
sea
voyage
and
a
change
of
climate
for
the
restoration
of
his
health
the
course
of
martin
van
buren
on
the
subject
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
forms
in
the
estimation
of
many
of
his
best
friends
by
no
means
the
most
creditable
portion
of
his
political
history
but
it
certainly
argues
well
for
his
magnanimity
and
freedom
from
merely
personal
resentment
that
he
gave
this
appointment
to
the
man
who
had
animadverted
upon
that
course
with
the
greatest
freedom
and
whose
rebuke
of
the
veto
pledge
severe
in
its
truth
and
justice
formed
the
only
discord
in
the
paean
of
partisan
flattery
which
greeted
his
inaugural
but
however
well
intended
it
came
too
late
in
the
midst
of
the
congratulations
of
his
friends
on
the
brightening
prospect
before
him
the
still
hopeful
and
vigorous
spirit
of
william
leggett
was
summoned
away
by
death
universal
regret
was
awakened
admiration
of
his
intellectual
power
and
that
generous
and
full
appreciation
of
his
high
moral
worth
which
had
been
in
too
many
instances
withheld
from
the
living
man
by
party
policy
and
prejudice
were
now
freely
accorded
to
the
dead
the
presses
of
both
political
parties
vied
with
each
other
in
expressions
of
sorrow
at
the
loss
of
a
great
and
true
man
the
democracy
through
all
its
organs
hastened
to
canonize
him
as
one
of
the
saints
of
its
calendar
the
general
committee
in
new
york
expunged
their
resolutions
of
censure
the
democratic
review
at
that
period
the
most
respectable
mouthpiece
of
the
democratic
party
made
him
the
subject
of
exalted
eulogy
his
early
friend
and
william
cullen
bryant
laid
upon
his
grave
the
following
tribute
alike
beautiful
and
true
the
earth
may
ring
from
shore
to
shore
with
echoes
of
a
glorious
name
but
he
whose
loss
our
tears
deplore
has
left
behind
him
more
than
fame
for
when
the
came
to
lie
on
leggett
warm
and
mighty
heart
and
quenched
his
bold
and
friendly
eye
his
spirit
did
not
all
depart
the
words
of
fire
that
from
his
pen
he
flung
upon
the
lucid
page
still
move
still
shake
the
hearts
of
men
amid
a
cold
and
coward
age
his
love
of
truth
too
warm
too
strong
for
hope
or
fear
to
chain
or
chill
his
hate
of
tyranny
and
wrong
burn
in
the
breasts
they
kindled
still
so
lived
and
died
william
leggett
what
a
rebuke
of
party
perfidy
of
political
meanness
of
the
common
arts
and
stratagems
of
demagogues
comes
up
from
his
grave
how
the
cheek
of
mercenary
selfishness
crimsons
at
the
thought
of
his
incorruptible
integrity
how
heartless
and
hollow
pretenders
who
offer
lip
service
to
freedom
while
they
give
their
hands
to
whatever
work
their
slaveholding
managers
may
assign
them
who
sit
in
chains
round
the
crib
of
governmental
patronage
putting
on
the
spaniel
and
putting
off
the
man
and
making
their
whole
lives
a
miserable
lie
shrink
back
from
a
contrast
with
the
proud
and
austere
dignity
of
his
character
what
a
comment
on
their
own
condition
is
the
memory
of
a
man
who
could
calmly
endure
the
loss
of
party
favor
the
reproaches
of
his
friends
the
malignant
assaults
of
his
enemies
and
the
fretting
evils
of
poverty
in
the
hope
of
bequeathing
like
the
dying
testator
of
ford
a
fame
by
scandal
untouched
to
memory
and
time
old
daughter
truth
the
praises
which
such
men
are
now
constrained
to
bestow
upon
him
are
their
own
condemnation
every
stone
which
they
pile
upon
his
grave
is
written
over
with
the
record
of
their
hypocrisy
we
have
written
rather
for
the
living
than
the
dead
as
one
of
that
proscribed
and
hunted
band
of
abolitionists
whose
rights
were
so
bravely
defended
by
william
leggett
we
should
indeed
be
wanting
in
ordinary
gratitude
not
to
do
honor
to
his
memory
but
we
have
been
actuated
at
the
present
time
mainly
by
a
hope
that
the
character
the
lineaments
of
which
we
have
so
imperfectly
sketched
may
awaken
a
generous
emulation
in
the
hearts
of
the
young
democracy
of
our
country
democracy
such
as
william
leggett
believed
and
practised
democracy
in
its
full
and
comprehensive
significance
is
destined
to
be
the
settled
political
faith
of
this
republic
because
the
despotism
of
slavery
has
usurped
its
name
and
offered
the
strange
incense
of
human
tears
and
blood
on
its
profaned
altars
shall
we
therefore
abandon
the
only
political
faith
which
coincides
with
the
gospel
of
jesus
and
meets
the
aspirations
and
wants
of
humanity
no
the
duty
of
the
present
generation
in
the
united
states
is
to
reduce
this
faith
to
practice
to
make
the
beautiful
ideal
a
fact
every
american
says
leggett
who
in
any
way
countenances
slavery
is
derelict
to
his
duty
as
a
christian
a
patriot
a
man
and
every
one
does
countenance
and
authorize
it
who
suffers
any
opportunity
of
expressing
his
deep
abhorrence
of
its
manifold
abominations
to
pass
unimproved
the
whole
world
has
an
interest
in
this
matter
the
influence
of
our
democratic
despotism
is
exerted
against
the
liberties
of
europe
political
reformers
in
the
old
world
who
have
testified
to
their
love
of
freedom
by
serious
sacrifices
hold
but
one
language
on
this
point
they
tell
us
that
american
slavery
furnishes
kings
and
aristocracies
with
their
most
potent
arguments
that
it
is
a
perpetual
drag
on
the
wheel
of
political
progress
we
have
before
us
at
this
time
a
letter
from
seidensticker
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
patriotic
movement
in
behalf
of
german
liberty
in
it
was
written
from
the
prison
of
celle
where
he
had
been
confined
for
eight
years
the
writer
expresses
his
indignant
astonishment
at
the
speeches
of
john
calhoun
and
others
in
congress
on
the
slavery
question
and
deplores
the
disastrous
influence
of
our
great
inconsistency
upon
the
cause
of
freedom
throughout
the
world
an
influence
which
paralyzes
the
hands
of
the
patriotic
reformer
while
it
strengthens
those
of
his
oppressor
and
deepens
around
the
living
martyrs
and
confessors
of
european
democracy
the
cold
shadow
of
their
prisons
joseph
sturge
of
birmingham
the
president
of
the
british
free
suffrage
union
and
whose
philanthropy
and
democracy
have
been
vouched
for
by
the
democratic
review
in
this
country
has
the
following
passage
in
an
address
to
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
although
an
admirer
of
the
institutions
of
your
country
and
deeply
lamenting
the
evils
of
my
own
government
i
find
it
difficult
to
reply
to
those
who
are
opposed
to
any
extension
of
the
political
rights
of
englishmen
when
they
point
to
america
and
say
that
where
all
have
a
control
over
the
legislation
but
those
who
are
guilty
of
a
dark
skin
slavery
and
the
slave
trade
remain
not
only
unmitigated
but
continue
to
extend
and
that
while
there
is
an
onward
movement
in
favor
of
its
extinction
not
only
in
england
and
france
but
in
cuba
and
brazil
american
legislators
cling
to
this
enormous
evil
without
attempting
to
relax
or
mitigate
its
horrors
how
long
shall
such
appeals
from
such
sources
be
wasted
upon
us
shall
our
baleful
example
enslave
the
world
shall
the
tree
of
democracy
which
our
fathers
intended
for
the
healing
of
the
nations
be
to
them
like
the
fabled
upas
blighting
all
around
it
the
men
of
the
north
the
pioneers
of
the
free
west
and
the
slaveholders
of
the
south
must
answer
these
questions
it
is
for
them
to
say
whether
the
present
wellnigh
intolerable
evil
shall
continue
to
increase
its
boundaries
and
strengthen
its
hold
upon
the
government
the
political
parties
and
the
religious
sects
of
our
country
interest
and
honor
present
possession
and
future
hope
the
memory
of
fathers
the
prospects
of
children
gratitude
affection
the
still
call
of
the
dead
the
cry
of
oppressed
nations
looking
hitherward
for
the
result
of
all
their
hopes
the
voice
of
god
in
the
soul
in
revelation
and
in
his
providence
all
appeal
to
them
for
a
speedy
and
righteous
decision
at
this
moment
on
the
floor
of
congress
democracy
and
slavery
have
met
in
a
the
south
stands
firm
it
allows
no
party
division
on
the
slave
question
one
of
its
members
has
declared
that
the
slave
states
have
no
traitors
can
the
same
be
said
of
the
free
now
as
in
the
time
of
the
fatal
missouri
compromise
there
are
it
is
to
be
feared
political
peddlers
among
our
representatives
whose
souls
are
in
the
market
and
whose
consciences
are
vendible
commodities
through
their
means
the
slave
power
may
gain
a
temporary
triumph
but
may
not
the
very
baseness
of
the
treachery
arouse
the
northern
heart
by
driving
the
free
states
to
the
wall
may
it
not
compel
them
to
turn
and
take
an
aggressive
attitude
clasp
hands
over
the
altar
of
their
common
freedom
and
swear
eternal
hostility
to
slavery
be
the
issue
of
the
present
contest
what
it
may
those
who
are
faithful
to
freedom
should
allow
no
temporary
reverse
to
shake
their
confidence
in
the
ultimate
triumph
of
the
right
the
slave
will
be
free
democracy
in
america
will
yet
be
a
glorious
reality
and
when
the
topstone
of
that
temple
of
freedom
which
our
fathers
left
unfinished
shall
be
brought
forth
with
shoutings
and
cries
of
grace
unto
it
when
our
now
liberty
lifts
up
her
head
and
prospers
happy
will
be
he
who
can
say
with
john
milton
among
those
who
have
something
more
than
wished
her
welfare
i
too
have
my
charter
and
freehold
of
rejoicing
to
me
and
my
heirs
nathaniel
peabody
rogers
and
lamb
the
frolic
and
the
gentle
has
vanished
from
his
kindly
hearth
so
in
one
of
the
sweetest
and
most
pathetic
of
his
poems
touching
the
loss
of
his
literary
friends
sang
wordsworth
we
well
remember
with
what
freshness
and
vividness
these
simple
lines
came
before
us
on
hearing
last
autumn
of
the
death
of
the
and
gifted
friend
whose
name
heads
this
article
for
there
was
much
in
his
character
and
genius
to
remind
us
of
the
gentle
author
of
elia
he
had
the
genial
humor
and
quaintness
his
nice
and
delicate
perception
of
the
beautiful
and
poetic
his
happy
easy
diction
not
the
result
as
in
the
case
of
that
of
the
english
essayist
of
slow
and
careful
elaboration
but
the
natural
spontaneous
language
in
which
his
conceptions
at
once
embodied
themselves
apparently
without
any
consciousness
of
effort
as
mark
antony
talked
he
wrote
right
on
telling
his
readers
often
what
they
themselves
did
know
yet
imparting
to
the
simplest
commonplaces
of
life
interest
and
significance
and
throwing
a
golden
haze
of
poetry
over
the
rough
and
thorny
pathways
of
duty
like
lamb
he
loved
his
friends
without
stint
or
limit
the
old
familiar
faces
haunted
him
lamb
loved
the
streets
and
lanes
of
london
the
places
where
he
oftenest
came
in
contact
with
the
warm
genial
heart
of
humanity
better
than
the
country
rogers
loved
the
wild
and
lonely
hills
and
valleys
of
new
hampshire
none
the
less
that
he
was
fully
alive
to
the
enjoyments
of
society
and
could
enter
with
the
heartiest
sympathy
into
all
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
his
friends
and
neighbors
in
another
point
of
view
he
was
not
unlike
elia
he
had
the
same
love
of
home
and
home
friends
and
familiar
objects
the
same
fondness
for
common
sights
and
sounds
the
same
dread
of
change
the
same
shrinking
from
the
unknown
and
the
dark
like
him
he
clung
with
a
child
love
to
the
living
present
and
recoiled
from
a
contemplation
of
the
great
change
which
awaits
us
like
him
he
was
content
with
the
goodly
green
earth
and
human
countenances
and
would
fain
set
up
his
tabernacle
here
he
had
less
of
what
might
be
termed
in
this
feeling
than
lamb
he
had
higher
views
he
loved
this
world
not
only
for
its
own
sake
but
for
the
opportunities
it
afforded
of
doing
good
like
the
persian
seer
he
beheld
the
legions
of
ormuzd
and
ahriman
of
light
and
darkness
contending
for
mastery
over
the
earth
as
the
sunshine
and
shadow
of
a
gusty
day
struggled
on
the
green
slopes
of
his
native
mountains
and
mingled
with
the
bright
host
he
would
fain
have
fought
on
until
its
banners
waved
in
eternal
sunshine
over
the
last
of
darkness
he
entered
into
the
work
of
reform
with
the
enthusiasm
and
chivalry
of
a
knight
of
the
crusades
he
had
faith
in
human
progress
in
the
ultimate
triumph
of
the
good
millennial
lights
beaconed
up
all
along
his
horizon
in
the
philanthropic
movements
of
the
day
in
the
efforts
to
remove
the
evils
of
slavery
war
intemperance
and
sanguinary
laws
in
the
humane
and
generous
spirit
of
much
of
our
modern
poetry
and
literature
in
the
growing
demand
of
the
religious
community
of
all
sects
for
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
of
love
and
humanity
he
heard
the
low
and
tremulous
prelude
of
the
great
anthem
of
universal
harmony
the
world
said
he
in
a
notice
of
the
music
of
the
hutchinson
family
is
out
of
tune
now
but
it
will
be
tuned
again
and
all
will
become
harmony
in
this
faith
he
lived
and
acted
working
not
always
as
it
seemed
to
some
of
his
friends
wisely
but
bravely
truthfully
earnestly
cheering
on
his
and
imparting
to
the
dullest
and
most
earthward
looking
of
them
something
of
his
own
zeal
and
loftiness
of
purpose
who
was
he
does
the
reader
ask
naturally
enough
too
for
his
name
has
never
found
its
way
into
fashionable
reviews
it
has
never
been
associated
with
tale
or
essay
or
poem
to
our
knowledge
our
friend
griswold
who
like
another
noah
has
launched
some
hundreds
of
american
poets
and
prose
writers
on
the
tide
of
immortality
in
his
two
huge
arks
of
rhyme
and
reason
has
either
overlooked
his
name
or
deemed
it
unworthy
of
preservation
then
too
he
was
known
mainly
as
the
editor
of
a
proscribed
and
paper
it
had
few
readers
of
literary
taste
and
discrimination
plain
earnest
men
and
women
intent
only
upon
the
thought
itself
and
caring
little
for
the
clothing
of
it
loved
the
of
for
its
honestness
and
earnestness
and
its
bold
rebukes
of
the
wrong
its
homage
to
what
its
editor
believed
to
be
right
but
the
literary
world
of
authors
and
critics
saw
and
heard
little
or
nothing
of
him
or
his
writings
i
once
had
a
bit
of
he
says
of
himself
on
one
occasion
and
had
i
attempted
it
in
some
pitiful
sectarian
or
party
or
literary
sheet
i
should
have
stood
a
chance
to
get
quoted
into
the
periodicals
now
who
dares
quote
from
the
of
he
wrote
for
humanity
as
his
biographer
justly
says
not
for
fame
he
wrote
because
he
had
something
to
say
and
true
to
nature
for
to
him
nature
was
truth
he
spoke
right
on
with
the
artlessness
and
simplicity
of
a
child
he
was
born
in
plymouth
new
hampshire
in
the
sixth
month
of
a
lineal
descendant
from
john
rogers
of
educated
at
dartmouth
college
he
studied
law
with
hon
richard
fletcher
of
salisbury
new
hampshire
now
of
boston
and
commenced
the
practice
of
it
in
in
his
native
village
he
was
diligent
and
successful
in
his
profession
although
seldom
known
as
a
pleader
about
the
year
he
became
interested
in
the
movement
his
was
one
of
the
few
voices
of
encouragement
and
sympathy
which
greeted
the
author
of
this
sketch
on
the
publication
of
a
pamphlet
in
favor
of
immediate
emancipation
he
gave
us
a
kind
word
of
approval
and
invited
us
to
his
mountain
home
on
the
banks
of
the
pemigewasset
an
invitation
which
two
years
afterwards
we
accepted
in
the
early
autumn
in
company
with
george
thompson
the
eloquent
reformer
who
has
since
been
elected
a
member
of
the
british
parliament
from
the
tower
hamlets
we
drove
up
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
white
mountain
tributary
of
the
merrimac
and
just
as
a
glorious
sunset
was
steeping
river
valley
and
mountain
in
its
hues
of
heaven
were
welcomed
to
the
pleasant
home
and
family
circle
of
our
friend
rogers
we
spent
two
delightful
evenings
with
him
his
cordiality
his
sympathy
in
our
object
his
keen
wit
inimitable
humor
and
childlike
and
simple
mirthfulness
his
full
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
in
art
and
nature
impressed
us
with
the
conviction
that
we
were
the
guests
of
no
ordinary
man
that
we
were
communing
with
unmistakable
genius
such
an
one
as
might
have
added
to
the
wit
and
eloquence
of
ben
jonson
famous
club
at
the
or
that
which
lamb
and
coleridge
and
southey
frequented
at
the
and
of
smithfield
the
most
brilliant
man
i
have
met
in
america
said
george
thompson
as
we
left
the
hospitable
door
of
our
friend
in
he
gave
up
his
law
practice
left
his
fine
outlook
at
plymouth
upon
the
mountains
of
the
north
moosehillock
and
the
haystacks
and
took
up
his
residence
at
concord
for
the
purpose
of
editing
the
of
an
paper
which
had
been
started
some
three
or
four
years
before
john
pierpont
than
whom
there
could
not
be
a
more
competent
witness
in
his
brief
and
beautiful
sketch
of
the
life
and
writings
of
rogers
does
not
overestimate
the
ability
with
which
the
herald
was
conducted
when
he
says
of
its
editor
as
a
newspaper
writer
we
think
him
unequalled
by
any
living
man
and
in
the
general
strength
clearness
and
quickness
of
his
intellect
we
think
all
who
knew
him
well
will
agree
with
us
that
he
was
not
excelled
by
any
editor
in
the
country
he
was
not
a
profound
reasoner
his
imagination
and
brilliant
fancy
played
the
wildest
tricks
with
his
logic
yet
considering
the
way
by
which
he
reached
them
it
is
remarkable
that
his
conclusions
were
so
often
correct
the
tendency
of
his
mind
was
to
extremes
a
zealous
calvinistic
he
became
an
equally
zealous
opponent
of
churches
and
priests
a
warm
politician
he
became
an
ultra
and
man
in
all
this
his
sincerity
was
manifest
if
in
the
indulgence
of
his
remarkable
powers
of
sarcasm
in
the
free
antics
of
a
humorous
fancy
upon
whose
graceful
neck
he
had
flung
loose
the
reins
he
sometimes
did
injustice
to
individuals
and
touched
in
irreverent
sport
the
hem
of
sacred
garments
it
had
the
excuse
at
least
of
a
generous
and
honest
motive
if
he
sometimes
exaggerated
those
who
best
knew
him
can
testify
that
he
set
down
naught
in
malice
we
have
before
us
a
printed
collection
of
his
writings
hasty
editorials
flung
off
without
care
or
revision
the
offspring
of
sudden
impulse
frequently
always
free
artless
unstudied
the
language
transparent
as
air
exactly
expressing
the
thought
he
loved
the
common
simple
dialect
of
the
people
the
beautiful
strong
old
saxon
the
talk
words
he
had
an
especial
dislike
of
learned
and
dictionary
words
he
used
to
recommend
cobbett
works
to
every
young
man
and
woman
who
has
been
hurt
in
his
or
her
talk
and
writing
by
going
to
school
our
limits
will
not
admit
of
such
extracts
from
the
collection
of
his
writings
as
would
convey
to
our
readers
an
adequate
idea
of
his
thought
and
manner
his
descriptions
of
natural
scenery
glow
with
life
one
can
almost
see
the
sunset
light
flooding
the
franconia
notch
and
glorifying
the
peaks
of
moosehillock
and
hear
the
murmur
of
the
west
wind
in
the
pines
and
the
light
liquid
voice
of
pemigewasset
sounding
up
from
its
rocky
channel
through
its
green
hem
of
maples
while
reading
them
we
give
a
brief
extract
from
an
editorial
account
of
an
autumnal
trip
to
vermont
we
have
recently
journeyed
through
a
portion
of
this
free
state
and
it
is
not
all
imagination
in
us
that
sees
in
its
bold
scenery
its
uninfected
inland
position
its
mountainous
but
fertile
and
verdant
surface
the
secret
of
the
noble
predisposition
of
its
people
they
are
located
for
freedom
liberty
home
is
on
their
green
mountains
their
farmer
republic
nowhere
touches
the
ocean
the
highway
of
the
crimes
as
well
as
its
nations
it
has
no
seaport
for
the
importation
of
slavery
or
the
exportation
of
its
own
highland
republicanism
should
slavery
ever
prevail
over
this
nation
to
its
utter
subjugation
the
last
lingering
footsteps
of
retiring
liberty
will
be
seen
not
as
daniel
webster
said
in
the
proud
old
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
about
bunker
hill
and
faneuil
hall
but
she
will
be
found
wailing
like
jephthah
daughter
among
the
and
along
the
sides
of
the
green
mountains
vermont
shows
gloriously
at
this
autumn
season
frost
has
gently
laid
hands
on
her
exuberant
vegetation
tinging
her
woods
without
abating
the
deep
verdure
of
her
herbage
everywhere
along
her
peopled
hollows
and
her
bold
hillslopes
and
summits
the
earth
is
alive
with
green
while
her
endless
forests
are
uniformed
with
all
the
hues
of
early
fall
richer
than
the
regimentals
of
the
kings
that
glittered
in
the
train
of
napoleon
on
the
confines
of
poland
when
he
lingered
there
on
the
last
outposts
of
summer
before
plunging
into
the
of
the
north
more
gorgeous
than
the
array
of
saladin
guard
in
the
wars
of
the
crusaders
or
of
in
all
his
glory
decked
in
all
colors
and
hues
but
still
the
hues
of
life
vegetation
touched
but
not
dead
or
if
killed
not
bereft
yet
of
of
life
effacing
fingers
had
not
yet
the
hills
beauty
lingers
all
looked
fresh
as
growing
foliage
vermont
frosts
do
seem
to
be
frosts
they
only
change
aspects
of
beauty
the
mountain
pastures
verdant
to
the
peaks
and
over
the
peaks
of
the
high
steep
hills
were
covered
with
the
amplest
feed
and
clothed
with
countless
sheep
the
heavy
with
second
crop
in
some
partly
cut
and
abandoned
as
if
in
very
weariness
and
satiety
blooming
with
honeysuckle
contrasting
strangely
with
the
colors
on
the
woods
the
fat
cattle
and
the
colts
and
morgans
wallowing
in
it
up
to
the
eyes
or
the
cattle
down
to
rest
with
full
bellies
by
ten
in
the
morning
fine
but
narrow
roads
wound
along
among
the
hills
free
almost
entirely
of
stone
and
so
smooth
as
to
be
safe
for
the
most
rapid
driving
made
of
their
rich
dark
soil
beautiful
villages
or
scattered
settlements
breaking
upon
the
delighted
view
on
the
meandering
way
making
the
ride
a
continued
scene
of
excitement
and
admiration
the
air
fresh
free
and
wholesome
the
road
almost
dead
level
for
miles
and
miles
among
mountains
that
lay
over
the
land
like
the
great
swells
of
the
sea
and
looking
in
the
prospect
as
though
there
could
be
no
passage
to
this
autumnal
limning
the
following
spring
picture
may
be
a
fitting
accompaniment
at
last
spring
is
here
in
full
flush
winter
held
on
tenaciously
and
mercilessly
but
it
has
let
go
the
great
sun
is
high
on
his
northern
journey
and
the
vegetation
and
the
and
the
loud
chorus
the
tree
budding
and
blowing
are
all
upon
us
and
the
glorious
grass
of
earth
garniture
with
its
green
the
have
come
and
the
the
scolding
your
corn
plant
your
corn
says
he
as
he
scurries
athwart
the
ploughed
ground
hardly
lifting
his
crank
wings
to
a
level
with
his
back
so
is
he
in
his
admonitions
the
earlier
birds
have
gone
to
housekeeping
and
have
disappeared
from
the
spray
there
has
been
brief
period
for
them
this
spring
for
scarcely
has
the
deep
snow
gone
but
the
grass
has
come
and
first
we
shall
know
the
ground
will
be
yellow
with
dandelions
i
incline
to
thank
heaven
this
glorious
morning
of
may
for
the
pleasant
home
from
which
we
can
greet
the
spring
hitherto
we
have
had
to
await
it
amid
a
thicket
of
village
houses
low
down
close
together
and
awfully
white
for
a
prospect
we
had
the
hinder
part
of
an
ugly
which
an
enterprising
neighbor
relieved
us
of
by
planting
a
right
before
our
eyes
on
his
own
land
and
he
had
a
right
to
which
relieved
us
also
of
all
prospect
whatever
and
the
revival
spirit
of
habitation
which
has
come
over
concord
is
clapping
up
a
house
between
every
two
in
the
already
crowded
town
and
the
prospect
is
it
will
be
soon
all
buildings
they
are
constructing
in
quite
good
taste
though
small
trim
but
i
had
rather
be
where
i
can
breathe
air
and
see
beyond
my
own
features
than
be
smothered
among
the
prettiest
houses
ever
built
we
are
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
it
is
all
sand
be
sure
on
all
four
sides
of
us
but
the
air
is
free
and
the
sand
too
at
times
and
our
water
there
is
danger
of
hard
drinking
to
live
by
it
air
and
water
the
two
necessaries
of
life
and
high
free
for
the
small
ones
there
is
a
sand
precipice
hard
by
high
enough
were
it
only
rock
and
overlooked
the
ocean
to
be
as
sublime
as
any
of
the
nahant
cliffs
as
it
is
it
is
altogether
a
safer
haunt
for
daring
childhood
which
could
hardly
break
its
neck
by
a
descent
of
some
hundreds
of
feet
a
low
flat
lies
between
us
and
the
town
with
its
and
guard
of
steeples
standing
round
it
was
marshy
and
wet
but
is
almost
all
redeemed
by
the
translation
into
it
of
the
high
hills
of
sand
it
must
have
been
a
terrible
place
for
frogs
judging
from
what
remains
of
it
bits
of
water
from
the
springs
hard
by
lay
here
and
there
about
the
low
ground
which
are
peopled
as
full
of
singers
as
ever
the
gallery
of
the
old
north
was
and
quite
as
melodious
ones
such
performers
i
never
heard
in
marsh
or
pool
they
are
not
the
great
stagnant
fat
and
like
parson
but
frogs
green
lively
and
i
passed
their
orchestra
going
home
the
other
evening
with
a
small
lad
and
they
were
at
it
all
parts
ten
thousand
peeps
shrill
and
incessant
coming
up
from
every
quarter
accompanied
by
a
second
from
some
larger
swimmer
with
his
trombone
and
broken
in
upon
every
now
and
then
but
not
discordantly
with
the
loud
quick
hallo
that
resembles
the
cry
of
the
are
the
hutchinsons
cried
the
lad
rainers
responded
i
glad
to
remember
enough
of
my
ancient
latin
to
know
that
rana
or
some
such
sounding
word
stood
for
frog
but
it
was
a
of
music
as
the
miller
friends
say
like
other
singers
all
but
the
hutchinsons
these
are
apt
to
sing
too
much
all
the
time
they
are
awake
constituting
really
too
much
of
a
good
thing
i
have
wondered
if
the
little
reptiles
were
singing
in
concert
or
whether
every
one
peeped
on
his
own
hook
their
neighbor
hood
only
making
it
a
chorus
i
incline
to
the
opinion
that
they
are
performing
together
that
they
know
the
tune
and
each
carries
his
part
selected
in
free
meeting
and
therefore
never
discordant
the
hour
rule
of
congress
might
be
useful
though
far
less
needed
among
the
frogs
than
among
the
profane
croakers
of
the
fens
at
washington
here
is
a
sketch
of
the
mountain
scenery
of
new
hampshire
as
seen
from
the
holderness
mountain
or
north
hill
during
a
visit
which
he
made
to
his
native
valley
in
the
autumn
of
the
earth
sphered
up
all
around
us
in
every
quarter
of
the
horizon
like
the
crater
of
a
vast
volcano
and
the
great
hollow
within
the
mountain
circle
was
as
smoky
as
vesuvius
or
etna
in
their
recess
of
eruption
the
little
village
of
plymouth
lay
right
at
our
feet
with
its
beautiful
expanse
of
intervale
opening
on
the
eye
like
a
lake
among
the
woods
and
hills
and
the
pemigewasset
bordered
along
its
crooked
way
with
rows
of
maples
meandering
from
upland
to
upland
through
the
meadows
our
young
footsteps
had
wandered
over
these
localities
time
had
cast
it
all
far
back
that
pemigewasset
with
its
meadows
and
border
trees
that
little
village
whitening
in
the
margin
of
its
inter
vale
and
that
one
house
which
we
could
distinguish
where
the
mother
that
watched
over
and
endured
our
wayward
childhood
totters
at
fourscore
to
the
south
stretched
a
broken
swelling
upland
country
but
champaign
from
the
top
of
north
hill
patched
all
over
with
and
green
the
roofs
of
the
shining
in
the
sun
southwest
the
cardigan
mountain
showed
its
bald
forehead
among
the
smokes
of
a
thousand
fires
kindled
in
the
woods
in
the
long
drought
westward
moosehillock
heaved
up
its
long
back
black
as
a
whale
and
turning
the
eye
on
northward
glancing
down
the
while
on
the
baker
river
valley
dotted
over
with
human
dwellings
like
for
size
you
behold
the
great
franconia
range
its
notch
and
its
haystacks
the
elephant
mountain
on
the
left
and
lafayette
great
haystack
on
the
right
shooting
its
peak
in
solemn
loneliness
high
up
into
the
desert
sky
and
overtopping
all
the
neighboring
alps
but
mount
washington
itself
the
prospect
of
these
is
most
impressive
and
satisfactory
we
do
believe
the
earth
presents
a
finer
mountain
display
the
haystacks
stand
there
like
the
pyramids
on
the
wall
of
mountains
one
of
them
eminently
has
this
egyptian
shape
it
is
as
accurate
a
pyramid
to
the
eye
as
any
in
the
old
valley
of
the
nile
and
a
good
deal
bigger
than
any
of
those
hoary
monuments
of
human
presumption
of
the
impious
tyranny
of
monarchs
and
priests
and
of
the
appalling
servility
of
the
erecting
multitude
arthur
seat
in
edinburgh
does
not
more
finely
resemble
a
sleeping
lion
than
the
huge
mountain
on
the
left
of
the
notch
does
an
elephant
with
his
great
overgrown
rump
turned
uncivilly
toward
the
gap
where
the
people
have
to
pass
following
round
the
panorama
you
come
to
the
ossipees
and
the
sandwich
mountains
peaks
innumerable
and
nameless
and
of
every
variety
of
fantastic
shape
down
their
vast
sides
are
displayed
the
slides
contrasting
with
the
fathomless
woods
but
the
lakes
you
see
lakes
as
well
as
woods
and
mountains
from
the
top
of
north
hill
newfound
lake
in
hebron
only
eight
miles
distant
you
ca
see
it
lies
too
deep
among
the
hills
ponds
show
their
small
blue
mirrors
from
various
quarters
of
the
great
picture
worthen
pond
and
the
hardhack
where
we
used
to
fish
for
trout
in
truant
barefooted
days
blair
white
oak
pond
and
long
pond
and
the
little
squam
a
beautiful
dark
sheet
of
deep
blue
water
about
two
miles
long
stretched
an
id
the
green
hills
and
woods
with
a
charming
little
beach
at
its
eastern
end
and
without
an
island
and
then
the
great
squam
connected
with
it
on
the
east
by
a
short
narrow
stream
the
very
queen
of
ponds
with
its
fleet
of
islands
surpassing
in
beauty
all
the
foreign
waters
we
have
seen
in
scotland
or
elsewhere
the
islands
covered
with
evergreens
which
impart
their
hue
to
the
mass
of
the
lake
as
it
stretches
seven
miles
on
east
from
its
smaller
sister
towards
the
peerless
winnipesaukee
great
squam
is
as
beautiful
as
water
and
island
can
be
but
winnipesaukee
it
is
the
very
of
the
great
spirit
it
looks
as
if
it
had
a
thousand
islands
some
of
them
large
enough
for
little
towns
and
others
not
bigger
than
a
swan
or
a
wild
duck
swimming
on
its
surface
of
glass
his
wit
and
sarcasm
were
generally
too
to
provoke
even
their
unfortunate
objects
playing
all
over
his
editorials
like
the
thunderless
lightnings
which
quiver
along
the
horizon
of
a
night
of
summer
calmness
but
at
times
his
indignation
launched
them
like
bolts
from
heaven
take
the
following
as
a
specimen
he
is
speaking
of
the
gag
rule
of
congress
and
commending
southern
representatives
for
their
skilful
selection
of
a
proper
person
to
do
their
work
they
have
a
quick
eye
at
the
south
to
the
character
or
as
they
would
say
the
points
of
a
slave
they
look
into
him
shrewdly
as
an
old
jockey
does
into
a
horse
they
will
pick
him
out
at
distance
among
a
thousand
freemen
they
have
a
nice
eye
to
detect
shades
of
vassalage
they
saw
in
the
aristocratic
popinjay
strut
of
a
counterfeit
democrat
an
itching
aspiration
to
play
the
slaveholder
they
beheld
it
in
cut
of
his
jib
and
his
extreme
northern
position
made
him
the
very
tool
for
their
purpose
the
little
creature
has
struck
at
the
right
of
petition
a
paltrier
hand
never
struck
at
a
noble
right
the
eagle
right
of
petition
so
loftily
sacred
in
the
eyes
of
the
constitution
that
congress
ca
begin
to
it
in
its
pride
of
place
is
hawked
at
by
this
crested
a
owl
would
have
seen
better
at
midnoon
than
to
have
done
it
it
is
an
idiot
such
as
you
see
fooling
about
among
the
shrub
oaks
and
dwarf
pitch
pines
in
the
winter
what
an
ignominious
death
to
the
lofty
right
were
it
to
die
by
such
a
hand
but
it
does
not
die
it
is
impalpable
to
the
mockery
of
such
vain
blows
we
are
glad
it
is
done
done
by
the
south
done
proudly
and
in
slaveholding
style
by
the
hand
of
a
vassal
what
a
man
does
by
another
he
does
by
himself
says
the
maxim
but
they
will
disown
the
honor
of
it
and
cast
it
on
the
despised
nigger
north
or
this
description
not
very
flattering
to
the
old
commonwealth
of
the
treatment
of
the
agent
of
massachusetts
in
south
carolina
slavery
may
perpetrate
anything
and
new
england
ca
see
it
it
can
horsewhip
the
old
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
and
spit
in
her
governmental
face
and
she
will
not
recognize
it
as
an
offence
she
sent
her
agent
to
charleston
on
a
state
embassy
slavery
caught
him
and
sent
him
ignominiously
home
the
solemn
great
man
came
back
in
a
hurry
he
returned
in
a
most
undignified
trot
he
ran
he
scampered
the
stately
official
the
old
bay
state
actually
pulled
foot
cleared
dug
as
they
say
like
any
scamp
with
a
hue
and
cry
after
him
her
grave
old
senator
who
no
more
thought
of
having
to
break
his
stately
walk
than
he
had
of
being
flogged
at
school
for
stealing
apples
came
back
from
carolina
upon
the
full
run
out
of
breath
and
out
of
dignity
well
what
the
result
why
nothing
she
no
more
thinks
of
showing
resentment
about
it
than
she
would
if
lightning
had
struck
him
he
was
sent
back
the
visitation
of
god
and
if
they
had
lynched
him
to
death
and
stained
the
streets
of
charleston
with
his
blood
a
boston
jury
if
they
could
have
held
inquest
over
him
would
have
found
that
he
by
the
visitation
of
god
and
it
would
have
been
crowner
quest
law
slavery
crowners
here
is
a
specimen
of
his
graceful
blending
of
irony
and
humor
he
is
expostulating
with
his
neighbor
of
the
new
hampshire
patriot
assuring
him
that
he
can
not
endure
the
ponderous
weight
of
his
arguments
begging
for
a
little
respite
and
as
a
means
of
obtaining
it
urging
the
editor
to
travel
he
advises
him
to
go
south
to
the
white
sulphur
springs
and
thinks
that
despite
of
his
dark
complexion
he
would
be
safe
there
from
being
sold
for
jail
fees
as
his
merits
would
more
than
counterbalance
his
colored
liabilities
which
after
all
were
only
prima
facie
evidence
against
him
he
suggests
texas
also
as
a
place
where
patriots
of
a
certain
class
most
do
congregate
and
continues
as
follows
there
is
arkansas
too
all
glorious
in
liberty
fresh
and
unsullied
like
venus
out
of
the
ocean
that
newly
discovered
star
in
the
firmament
banner
of
this
republic
sister
arkansas
with
her
knife
graceful
at
her
side
like
the
huntress
diana
with
her
silver
bow
oh
it
would
be
refreshing
and
recruiting
to
an
exhausted
patriot
to
go
and
replenish
his
soul
at
her
fountains
the
newly
evacuated
lands
of
the
cherokee
too
a
sweet
place
now
for
a
lover
of
his
country
to
visit
to
renew
his
by
wandering
among
the
quenched
hearths
of
the
expatriated
indians
a
land
all
smoking
with
the
red
man
departing
curse
a
malediction
that
went
to
the
centre
yes
and
florida
blossoming
and
leafy
florida
yet
warm
with
the
of
osceola
and
his
warriors
shed
gloriously
under
flag
of
truce
why
should
a
patriot
of
such
a
fancy
for
nature
immure
himself
in
the
cells
of
the
city
and
forego
such
an
inviting
and
so
broad
a
landscape
ite
viator
go
forth
traveller
and
leave
this
mouldy
editing
to
less
elastic
fancies
we
would
respectfully
invite
our
colonel
to
travel
what
signifies
journey
wander
go
forth
itinerate
exercise
perambulate
roam
he
gives
the
following
ludicrous
definition
of
congress
but
what
is
congress
it
is
the
echo
of
the
country
at
home
the
weathercock
that
denotes
and
answers
the
shifting
wind
a
thing
of
tail
nearly
all
tail
moved
by
the
tail
and
by
the
wind
with
small
heading
and
that
corresponding
implicitly
in
movement
with
the
broad
stern
which
widens
out
behind
to
catch
the
breath
of
brotherhood
as
that
turns
it
turns
when
that
stops
it
stops
and
in
calmish
weather
looks
as
steadfast
and
firm
as
though
it
was
riveted
to
the
centre
the
wind
blows
and
the
little
head
dodges
this
way
and
that
in
endless
fluctuation
such
is
congress
or
a
great
portion
of
it
it
will
point
to
the
northwest
heavens
of
liberty
whenever
the
breezes
bear
down
irresistibly
upon
it
from
the
regions
of
political
fair
weather
it
will
abolish
slavery
at
the
capitol
when
it
has
already
been
doomed
to
abolition
and
death
everywhere
else
in
the
country
will
be
in
at
the
death
replying
to
the
charge
that
the
abolitionists
of
the
north
were
secret
in
their
movements
and
designs
he
says
secret
why
our
movements
have
been
as
prominent
and
open
as
the
from
the
beginning
we
have
striven
from
the
outset
to
write
the
whole
matter
in
the
heavens
that
the
utmost
south
might
read
it
we
have
cast
an
arc
upon
the
horizon
like
the
semicircle
of
the
polar
lights
and
upon
it
have
bent
our
motto
emancipation
glorious
as
the
rainbow
we
have
engraven
it
there
on
the
blue
table
of
the
cold
vault
in
letters
tall
enough
for
the
reading
of
the
nations
and
why
has
the
far
south
not
read
and
believed
before
this
because
a
steam
has
gone
up
a
fog
from
new
england
pulpit
and
her
degenerate
press
and
hidden
the
beaming
revelation
from
its
vision
the
northern
hierarchy
and
aristocracy
have
cheated
the
south
he
spoke
at
times
with
severity
of
slaveholders
but
far
oftener
of
those
who
without
the
excuse
of
education
and
habit
and
prompted
only
by
a
selfish
consideration
of
political
or
sectarian
advantage
apologized
for
the
wrong
and
discountenanced
the
movement
we
have
nothing
to
say
said
he
to
the
slave
he
is
no
party
to
his
own
enslavement
he
is
none
to
his
disenthralment
we
have
nothing
to
say
to
the
south
the
real
holder
of
slaves
is
not
there
he
is
in
the
north
the
free
north
the
south
alone
has
not
the
power
to
hold
the
slave
it
is
the
character
of
the
nation
that
binds
and
holds
him
it
is
the
republic
that
does
it
the
efficient
force
of
which
is
north
of
mason
and
dixon
line
by
virtue
of
the
majority
of
northern
hearts
and
voices
slavery
lives
in
the
south
in
he
spent
a
few
weeks
in
england
ireland
and
scotland
he
has
left
behind
a
few
beautiful
memorials
of
his
tour
his
ride
over
the

ailsa

gave
his
paper
an
interest
in
the
eyes
of
many
who
had
no
sympathy
with
his
political
and
religious
views
scattered
all
over
his
editorials
like
gems
are
to
be
found
beautiful
images
sweet
touches
of
heartfelt
pathos
thoughts
which
the
reader
pauses
over
with
surprise
and
delight
we
subjoin
a
few
specimens
taken
almost
at
random
from
the
book
before
us
a
what
can
match
it
for
eloquence
and
poetry
that
rush
from
heaven
of
the
big
drops
in
what
multitude
and
succession
and
how
they
sound
as
they
strike
how
they
play
on
the
old
home
roof
and
the
thick
what
music
to
go
to
sleep
by
to
the
tired
boy
as
he
lies
under
the
naked
roof
and
the
great
low
bass
thunder
as
it
rolls
off
over
the
hills
and
settles
down
behind
them
to
the
very
centre
and
you
can
feel
the
old
earth
jar
under
your
feet
there
was
no
oratory
in
the
speech
of
the
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
that
word
no
grace
of
elocution
but
mighty
thoughts
radiating
off
from
his
heated
mind
like
sparks
from
the
glowing
steel
of
his
own
anvil
the
hard
hands
of
irish
labor
with
nothing
in
them
they
ring
like
slabs
of
marble
together
in
response
to
the
wild
appeals
of
and
the
british
stand
conquered
before
them
with
shouldered
arms
ireland
is
on
her
feet
with
nothing
in
her
hands
impregnable
unassailable
in
utter
defencelessness
the
first
time
that
ever
a
nation
sprung
to
its
feet
unarmed
the
veterans
of
england
behold
them
and
forbear
to
fire
they
see
no
mark
it
will
not
do
to
fire
upon
men
it
will
do
only
to
fire
upon
soldiers
they
are
the
proper
mark
of
the
murderous
gun
but
men
can
not
be
shot
it
is
coming
to
that
abolition
of
war
the
world
over
and
when
it
does
come
to
it
oh
what
a
long
breath
of
relief
the
tired
world
will
draw
as
it
stretches
itself
for
the
first
time
out
upon
earth
greensward
and
learns
the
meaning
of
repose
and
peaceful
sleep
he
who
vests
his
labor
in
the
faithful
ground
is
dealing
directly
with
god
human
fraud
or
weakness
do
not
intervene
between
him
and
his
requital
no
mechanic
has
a
set
of
customers
so
trustworthy
as
god
and
the
elements
no
savings
bank
is
so
sure
as
the
old
earth
literature
is
the
luxury
of
words
it
originates
nothing
it
does
nothing
it
talks
hard
words
about
the
labor
of
others
and
is
reckoned
more
meritorious
for
it
than
genius
and
labor
for
doing
what

only
descant
upon

trades
on
the

it

it

a

an
owl
in
more
respects

real

how

how

how

in
matters
beyond

these
are
the
lessons
to
learn
and
you
find
little
of
them
in
libraries
that
accursed
drum
and
fife
how
they
have
maddened
mankind
and
the
deep
bass
boom
of
the
cannon
chiming
in
in
the
chorus
of
battle
that
trumpet
and
wild
charging
bugle
how
they
set
the
military
devil
in
a
man
and
make
him
into
a
soldier
think
of
the
human
family
falling
upon
one
another
at
the
inspiration
of
music
how
must
god
feel
at
it
to
see
those
he
meant
should
be
waked
to
a
love
bordering

divine
strung

as

at

poor
devils
were
they
born

such
a
gauntlet
after

of

look
about
you
and
see
your
squirming
neighbors
writhing
and
twisting
like
so
many
angleworms
in
a
fisher
or
the
wriggling
animalculae
seen
in
the

drop
held
to
the
sun
how
they
look
how
they
feel
how
base
it
makes
them
all
every
human
being
is
entitled
to
the
means
of
life
as
the
trout
is
to
his
brook
or
the
lark
to
the
blue
sky
is
it
well
to
put
a
human
one
here
to
die
of
hunger
thirst
and
nakedness
or
else
be
preserved
as
a
pauper
is
this
fair
earth
but
a
by
creation
and
intent
was
it
made
for
that
and
these
other
round
things
we
see
dancing
in
the
firmament
to
the
music
of
the
spheres
are
they
all
great
shining
the
divines
always
admit
things
after
the
age
has
adopted
them
they
are
as
careful
of
the
age
as
the
weathercock
is
of
the
wind
you
might
as
well
catch
an
old
experienced
weathercock
on
some
ancient
orthodox
steeple
standing
all
day
with
its
tail
east
in
a
strong
out
wind
as
the
divines
at
odds
with
the
age
but
we
must
cease
quoting
the
admirers
of
jean
paul
richter
might
find
much
of
the
charm
and
variety
of
the
flower
fruit
and
thorn
pieces
in
this
newspaper
collection
they
may
see
perhaps
as
we
do
some
things
which
they
can
not
approve
of
the
tendency
of
which
however
intended
is
very
questionable
but
with
us
they
will
pardon
something
to
the
spirit
of
liberty
much
to
that
of
love
and
humanity
which
breathes
through
all
disgusted
and
at
the
general
indifference
of
church
and
clergy
to
the
temporal
condition
of
the
people
at
their
apologies
for
and
defences
of
slavery
war
and
capital
punishment
rogers
turned
protestant
in
the
full
sense
of
the
term
he
spoke
of
priests
and
pulpit
wizards
as
freely
as
john
milton
did
two
centuries
ago
although
with
far
less
bitterness
and
rasping
satire
he
could
not
endure
to
see
christianity
and
humanity
divorced
he
longed
to
see
the
beautiful
life
of
jesus
his
sweet
humanities
his
brotherly
love
his
abounding
sympathies
made
the
example
of
all
men
thoroughly
democratic
in
his
view
all
men
were
equal
priests
stripped
of
their
sacerdotal
tailoring
were
in
his
view
but
men
after
all
he
pitied
them
he
said
for
they
were
in
a
wrong
position
above
life
comforts
and
sympathies
up
in
the
unnatural
cold
they
had
better
come
down
among
men
and
endure
and
enjoy
with
them
mankind
said
he
want
the
healing
influences
of
humanity
they
must
love
one
another
more
disinterested
good
will
make
the
world
as
it
should
be
his
last
visit
to
his
native
valley
was
in
the
autumn
of
in
a
familiar
letter
to
a
friend
he
thus
describes
his
farewell
view
of
the
mountain
glories
of
his
childhood
home
i
went
a
jaunt
thursday
last
about
twenty
miles
north
of
this
valley
into
the
mountain
region
where
what
i
beheld
if
i
could
tell
it
as
i
saw
it
would
make
your
outlawed
sheet
sought
after
wherever
our
saxon
tongue
is
spoken
in
the
wide
world
i
have
been
many
a
time
among
those
alps
and
never
without
a
kindling
of
wildest
enthusiasm
in
my
woodland
blood
but
i
never
saw
them
till
last
thursday
they
never
loomed
distinctly
to
my
eye
before
and
the
sun
never
shone
on
them
from
heaven
till
then
they
were
so
near
me
i
could
seem
to
hear
the
voice
of
their
cataracts
as
i
could
count
their
great
slides
streaming
adown
their
lone
and
desolate
sides
old
slides
some
of
them
overgrown
with
young
woods
like
scars
on
the
breast
of
a
giant
the
great
rains
had
clothed
the
valleys
of
the
upper
pemigewasset
in
the
darkest
and
deepest
green
the
meadows
were
richer
and
more
glorious
in
their
thick
feed
than
queen
anne
garden
as
i
saw
it
from
the
windows
of
windsor
castle
and
the
dark
hemlock
and
hackmatack
woods
were
yet
darker
after
the
wet
season
as
they
lay
in
a
hundred
wildernesses
in
the
mighty
recesses
of
the
mountains
but
the
peaks
the
eternal
the
solitary
the
beautiful
the
glorious
and
dear
mountain
peaks
my
own
moosehillock
and
my
native
haystacks
these
were
the
things
on
which
eye
and
heart
gazed
and
lingered
and
i
seemed
to
see
them
for
the
last
time
it
was
on
my
way
back
that
i
halted
and
turned
to
look
at
them
from
a
high
point
on
the
thornton
road
it
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
it
had
rained
among
the
hills
about
the
notch
and
cleared
off
the
sun
there
sombred
at
that
early
hour
as
towards
his
setting
was
pouring
his
most
glorious
light
upon
the
naked
peaks
and
they
casting
their
mighty
shadows
far
down
among
the
inaccessible
woods
that
darken
the
hollows
that
stretch
between
their
bases
a
cloud
was
creeping
up
to
perch
and
rest
awhile
on
the
highest
top
of
great
haystack
vulgar
folks
have
called
it
mount
lafayette
since
the
visit
of
that
brave
old
frenchman
in
or
if
they
had
asked
his
opinion
he
would
have
told
them
the
names
of
mountains
could
be
altered
and
especially
names
like
that
so
appropriate
so
descriptive
and
so
picturesque
a
little
hard
white
cloud
that
looked
like
a
hundred
fleeces
of
wool
rolled
into
one
was
climbing
rapidly
along
up
the
northwestern
ridge
that
ascended
to
the
lonely
top
of
great
haystack
all
the
others
were
bare
four
or
five
of
them
as
distinct
and
shapely
as
so
many
pyramids
some
topped
out
with
naked
cliff
on
which
the
sun
lay
in
melancholy
glory
others
clothed
thick
all
the
way
up
with
the
old
new
hampshire
hemlock
or
the
daring
hackmatack
pierpont
hackmatack
you
could
see
their
shadows
stretching
many
and
many
a
mile
over
grant
and
location
away
beyond
the
invading
foot
of
incorporation
where
the
has
scarcely
explored
and
where
the
moose
browses
now
i
suppose
as
undisturbed
as
he
did
before
the
settlement
of
the
state
i
wish
our
young
friend
and
genius
harrison
eastman
had
been
with
me
to
see
the
sunlight
as
it
glared
on
the
tops
of
those
woods
and
to
see
the
purple
of
the
mountains
i
looked
at
it
myself
almost
with
the
eye
of
a
painter
if
a
painter
looked
with
mine
though
he
never
could
look
off
upon
his
canvas
long
enough
to
make
a
picture
he
would
gaze
forever
at
the
original
but
i
had
to
leave
it
and
to
say
in
my
heart
farewell
and
as
i
travelled
on
down
and
the
sun
sunk
lower
and
lower
towards
the
summit
of
the
western
ridge
the
clouds
came
up
and
formed
an
alpine
range
in
the
evening
heavens

so
dark
and
dense

fancy
could
easily
mistake
them
for
a

there
were
the
peaks
and
the
great
passes
the
franconia

among
the
cloudy
cliffs
and
the
great

mountain
gap
his
health
never
robust
had
been
gradually
failing
for
some
time
previous
to
his
death
he
needed
more
repose
and
quiet
than
his
duties
as
an
editor
left
him
and
to
this
end
he
purchased
a
small
and
pleasant
farm
in
his
loved
pennigewasset
valley
in
the
hope
that
he
might
there
recruit
his
wasted
energies
in
the
sixth
month
of
the
year
of
his
death
in
a
letter
to
us
he
spoke
of
his
prospects
in
language
which
even
then
brought
moisture
to
our
eyes
i
am
striving
to
get
me
an
asylum
of
a
farm
i
have
a
wife
and
seven
children
every
one
of
them
with
a
whole
spirit
i
do
want
to
be
separated
from
any
of
them
only
with
a
view
to
come
together
again
i
have
a
beautiful
little
retreat
in
prospect
forty
odd
miles
north
where
i
imagine
i
can
get
potatoes
and
repose
a
sort
of
haven
or
port
i
am
among
the
breakers
and
for
land
if
i
get
this
home
it
is
a
mile
or
two
in
among
the
hills
from
the
pretty
domicil
once
visited
by
yourself
and
glorious
thompson
i
am
this
moment
indulging
the
fancy
that
i
may
see
you
at
it
before
we
die
why
ca
i
have
you
come
and
see
me
you
see
dear
i
do
want
to
send
you
anything
short
of
a
full
epistle
let
me
end
as
i
begun
with
the
proffer
of
my
hand
in
grasp
of
yours
extended
my
heart
i
do
not
proffer
it
was
yours
before
it
shall
be
yours
while
i
am
p
rogers
alas
the
haven
of
a
deeper
repose
than
he
had
dreamed
of
was
close
at
hand
he
lingered
until
the
middle
of
the
tenth
month
suffering
much
yet
calm
and
sensible
to
the
last
just
before
his
death
he
desired
his
children
to
sing
at
his
bedside
that
touching
song
of
lover
angel
turning
his
eyes
towards
the
open
window
through
which
the
leafy
glory
of
the
season
he
most
loved
was
visible
he
listened
to
the
sweet
melody
in
the
words
of
his
friend
pierpont
the
angel
whisper
stole
in
song
upon
his
closing
ear
from
his
own
daughter
lips
it
came
so
musical
and
clear
that
scarcely
knew
the
dying
man
what
melody
was
there
the
last
of
earth
or
first
of
heaven
pervading
all
the
air
he
sleeps
in
the
concord
under
the
shadow
of
oaks
the
very
spot
he
would
have
chosen
for
he
looked
upon
trees
with
something
akin
to
human
affection
they
are
he
said
the
beautiful
handiwork
and
architecture
of
god
on
which
the
eye
never
tires
every
one
is
a
feather
in
the
earth

a
plume
in

on

comfort
a

and
an
ornament

hung
over
him
her
buds
and
opened
beside

summer
has
laid
her
green
oaken
garland
on

and
now
the
of

upon

cast
a

on
that
mound

loved

shall
it
be
less
kind
to
him
than
nature
shall
the
bigotry
of
sect
and
creed
and
profession
drive
its
condemnatory
stake
into
his

forbid
the
doubts
which
he
sometimes
unguardedly
expressed
had
relation
we
are
constrained
to
believe
to
the
glosses
of
commentators
and
and
the
inconsistency
of
professors
rather
than
to
those
facts
and
precepts
of
christianity
to
which
he
gave
the
constant
assent
of
his
practice
he
sought
not
his
own
his
heart
yearned
with
pity
and
brotherly
affection
for
all
the
poor
and
suffering

beautiful
allegory
might
have
written
in
the
golden
book
of
remembrance
as
he
did
of
the
good

ben
adhem
he
loved
his
robert
dinsmore
the
great
charm
of
scottish
poetry
consists
in
its
simplicity
and
genuine
unaffected
sympathy
with
the
common
joys
and
sorrows
of
daily
life
it
is
a
household
melody
it
calls
to
mind
the
pastoral
bleat
on
the
hillsides
the
kirkbells
of
a
summer
sabbath
the
song
of
the
lark
in
the
sunrise
the
cry
of
the
quail
in
the
the
low
of
cattle
and
the
blithe
carol
of
milkmaids
when
the
kye
come
hame
at
gloaming
meetings
at
fair
and
market
blushing
betrothments
merry
weddings
the
joy
of
young
maternity
the
lights
and
shades
of
domestic
life
its
bereavements
and
partings
its
chances
and
changes
its
holy
and
funerals
solemnly
beautiful
in
quiet
kirkyards
these
furnish
the
hints
of
the
immortal
melodies
of
burns
the
sweet
ballads
of
the
ettrick
shepherd
and
allan
cunningham
and
the
rustic
drama
of
ramsay
it
is
the
poetry
of
home
of
nature
and
the
affections
all
this
is
sadly
wanting
in
our
young
literature
we
have
no
songs
american
domestic
life
has
never
been
hallowed
and
beautified
by
the
sweet
and
graceful
and
tender
associations
of
poetry
we
have
no
yankee
pastorals
our
rivers
and
streams
turn
mills
and
float
rafts
and
are
otherwise
as
commendably
useful
as
those
of
scotland
but
no
quaint
ballad
or
simple
song
reminds
us
that
men
and
women
have
loved
met
and
parted
on
their
banks
or
that
beneath
each
roof
within
their
valleys
the
tragedy
and
comedy
of
life
have
been
enacted
our
poetry
is
cold
and
imitative
it
seems
more
the
product
of
intellects
than
the
spontaneous
outgushing
of
hearts
warm
with
love
and
strongly
sympathizing
with
human
nature
as
it
actually
exists
about
us
with
the
joys
and
griefs
of
the
men
and
women
whom
we
meet
daily
unhappily
the
opinion
prevails
that
a
poet
must
be
also
a
philosopher
and
hence
it
is
that
much
of
our
poetry
is
as
indefinable
in
its
mysticism
as
an
indian
brahmin
commentary
on
his
sacred
books
or
german
metaphysics
subjected
to
homeopathic
dilution
it
assumes
to
be
prophetical
and
its
utterances
are
oracular
it
tells
of
strange
vague
emotions
and
yearnings
painfully
suggestive
of
spiritual
groanings
which
can
not
be
uttered
if
it
babbles
o
green
fields
and
the
common
sights
and
sounds
of
nature
it
is
only
for
the
purpose
of
finding
some
vague
analogy
between
them
and
its
internal
experiences
and
longings
it
leaves
the
warm
and
comfortable
fireside
of
actual
knowledge
and
human
comprehension
and
goes
wailing
and
gibbering
like
a
ghost
about
the
impassable
doors
of
mystery
it
fain
would
be
resolved
how
things
are
done
and
who
the
tailor
is
that
works
for
the
man
i
the
sun
how
shall
we
account
for
this
marked
tendency
in
the
literature
of
a
shrewd
practical
people
is
it
that
real
life
in
new
england
lacks
those
conditions
of
poetry
and
romance
which
age
reverence
and
superstition
have
gathered
about
it
in
the
old
world
is
it
that
ours
are
not
tempe
nor
arcadia
vales
but
are
more
famous
for
growing
indian
corn
and
potatoes
and
the
manufacture
of
wooden
ware
and
pedler
notions
than
for
romantic
associations
and
legendary
interest
that
our
huge
unshapely
shingle
structures
blistering
in
the
sun
and
glaring
with
windows
were
evidently
never
reared
by
the
spell
of
pastoral
harmonies
as
the
walls
of
thebes
rose
at
the
sound
of
the
lyre
of
amphion
that
the
habits
of
our
people
are
too
cool
cautious
undemonstrative
to
furnish
the
warp
and
woof
of
song
and
pastoral
and
that
their
dialect
and
figures
of
speech
however
richly
significant
and
expressive
in
the
autobiography
of
sam
slick
or
the
satire
of
hosea
biglow
and
ethan
spike
form
a
very
awkward
medium
of
sentiment
and
pathos
all
this
may
be
true
but
the
yankee
after
all
is
a
man
and
as
such
his
history
could
it
be
got
at
must
have
more
or
less
of
poetic
material
in
it
moreover
whether
conscious
of
it
or
not
he
also
stands
relieved
against
the
background
of
nature
beauty
or
sublimity
there
is
a
poetical
side
to
the
commonplace
of
his
incomings
and
outgoings
study
him
well
and
you
may
frame
an
idyl
of
some
sort
from
his
apparently
prosaic
existence
our
poets
we
must
needs
think
are
deficient
in
that
shiftiness
ready
adaptation
to
circumstances
and
ability
of
making
the
most
of
things
for
which
as
a
people
we
are
proverbial
can
they
make
nothing
of
our
thanksgiving
that
annual
gathering
of
friends
do
they
find
nothing
to
their
purpose
in
our
buskings
pickings
summer
picnics
and
winter
is
there
nothing
available
in
our
peculiarities
of
climate
scenery
customs
and
political
institutions
does
the
yankee
leap
into
life
shrewd
hard
and
speculating
armed
like
pallas
for
a
struggle
with
fortune
are
there
not
boys
and
girls
school
loves
and
friendship
courtings
and
hope
and
fear
and
all
the
varied
play
of
human
passions
the
keen
struggles
of
gain
the
mad
grasping
of
ambition
sin
and
remorse
tearful
repentance
and
holy
aspirations
who
shall
say
that
we
have
not
all
the
essentials
of
the
poetry
of
human
life
and
simple
nature
of
the
hearth
and
the
here
then
is
a
mine
unworked
a
harvest
ungathered
who
shall
sink
the
shaft
and
thrust
in
the
sickle
and
here
let
us
say
that
the
mere
dilettante
and
the
amateur
ruralist
may
as
well
keep
their
hands
off
the
prize
is
not
for
them
he
who
would
successfully
strive
for
it
must
be
himself
what
he
sings
part
and
parcel
of
the
rural
life
of
new
england
one
who
has
grown
strong
amidst
its
healthful
influences
familiar
with
all
its
details
and
capable
of
detecting
whatever
of
beauty
humor
or
pathos
pertain
to
it
one
who
has
added
to
his
the
large
experience
of
an
active
participation
in
the
rugged
toil
the
hearty
amusements
the
trials
and
the
pleasures
he
describes
we
have
been
led
to
these
reflections
by
an
incident
which
has
called
up
before
us
the
homespun
figure
of
an
old
friend
of
our
boyhood
who
had
the
good
sense
to
discover
that
the
poetic
element
existed
in
the
simple
home
life
of
a
country
farmer
although
himself
unable
to
give
a
very
creditable
expression
of
it
he
had
the
vision
indeed
but
the
faculty
divine
was
wanting
or
if
he
possessed
it
in
any
degree
as
thersites
says
of
the
wit
of
ajax
it
would
not
out
but
lay
coldly
in
him
like
fire
in
the
flint
while
engaged
this
morning
in
looking
over
a
large
exchange
list
of
newspapers
a
few
stanzas
of
poetry
in
the
scottish
dialect
attracted
our
attention
as
we
read
them
like
a
wizard
rhyme
they
seemed
to
have
the
power
of
bearing
us
back
to
the
past
they
had
long
ago
graced
the
columns
of
that
solitary
sheet
which
once
a
week
diffused
happiness
over
our
fireside
circle
making
us
acquainted
in
our
lonely
nook
with
the
of
the
great
world
the
verses
we
are
now
constrained
to
admit
are
not
remarkable
in
themselves
truth
and
simple
nature
only
yet
how
our
young
hearts
responded
to
them
twenty
years
ago
there
were
fewer
than
at
present
and
as
our
whole
stock
of
light
literature
consisted
of
ellwood
and
the
selections
of
murray
english
it
is
not
improbable
that
we
were
in
a
condition
to
overestimate
the
contributions
to
the
poet
corner
of
our
village
newspaper
be
that
as
it
may
we
welcome
them
as
we
would
the
face
of
an
old
friend
for
they
somehow
remind
us
of
the
scent
of
haymows
the
breath
of
cattle
the
fresh
greenery
by
the
brookside
the
moist
earth
broken
by
the
coulter
and
turned
up
to
the
sun
and
winds
of
may
this
particular
piece
which
follows
is
entitled
and
was
occasioned
by
the
crushing
of
a
by
the
author
while
ploughing
among
his
corn

has
something
of
the
simple
tenderness

anely
this
he
gar
the
ills
which
here
await
us
yield
lastin
bliss
in
the
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
considerable
number
of
presbyterians
of
scotch
descent
from
the
north
of
ireland
emigrated
to
the
new
world
in
the
spring
of
the
inhabitants
of
haverhill
on
the
merrimac
saw
them
passing
up
the
river
in
several
canoes
one
of
which
unfortunately
upset
in
the
rapids
above
the
village
the
following
fragment
of
a
ballad
celebrating
this
event
has
been
handed
down
to
the
present
time
and
may
serve
to
show
the
feelings
even
then
of
the
old
english
settlers
towards
the
irish
emigrants
they
began
to
scream
and
bawl
as
out
they
tumbled
one
and
all
and
if
the
devil
had
spread
his
net
he
could
have
made
a
glorious
haul
the
proceeded
up
the
river
and
landing
opposite
to
the
uncanoonuc
hills
on
the
present
site
of
manchester
proceeded
inland
to
beaver
pond
charmed
with
the
appearance
of
the
country
they
resolved
here
to
terminate
their
wanderings
under
a
venerable
oak
on
the
margin
of
the
little
lake
they
knelt
down
with
their
minister
jamie
mcgregore
and
laid
in
prayer
and
thanksgiving
the
foundation
of
their
settlement
in
a
few
years
they
had
cleared
large
fields
built
substantial
stone
and
frame
dwellings
and
a
large
and
commodious
wealth
had
accumulated
around
them
and
they
had
everywhere
the
reputation
of
a
shrewd
and
thriving
community
they
were
the
first
in
new
england
to
cultivate
the
potato
which
their
neighbors
for
a
long
time
regarded
as
a
pernicious
root
altogether
unfit
for
a
christian
stomach
every
lover
of
that
invaluable
esculent
has
reason
to
remember
with
gratitude
the
settlers
of
londonderry
their
moral
acclimation
in
ireland
had
not
been
without
its
effect
upon
their
character
side
by
side
with
a
presbyterianism
as
austere
as
that
of
john
knox
had
grown
up
something
of
the
wild
milesian
humor
love
of
convivial
excitement
and
their
long
prayers
and
fierce
zeal
in
behalf
of
orthodox
tenets
only
served
in
the
eyes
of
their
puritan
neighbors
to
make
more
glaring
still
the
scandal
of
their
marked
social
irregularities
it
became
a
common
saying
in
the
region
round
about
that
the
derry
presbyterians
would
never
give
up
a
pint
of
doctrine
or
a
pint
of
rum
their
second
minister
was
an
old
scarred
fighter
who
had
signalized
himself
in
the
stout
defence
of
londonderry
when
james
ii
and
his
papists
were
thundering
at
its
gates
agreeably
to
his
directions
his
old
in
their
leathern
doublets
and
battered
steel
caps
bore
him
to
his
grave
firing
over
him
the
same
rusty
muskets
which
had
swept
down
rank
after
rank
of
the
men
of
amalek
at
the
derry
siege
erelong
the
celebrated
derry
fair
was
established
in
imitation
of
those
with
which
they
had
been
familiar
in
ireland
thither
annually
came
all
manner
of
and
pedlers
gentlemen
and
beggars
tellers
wrestlers
dancers
and
fiddlers
gay
young
farmers
and
buxom
maidens
strong
drink
abounded
they
who
had
wrestled
and
joked
together
in
the
morning
not
unfrequently
closed
the
day
with
a
fight
until
like
the
revellers
of
donnybrook
their
hearts
were
soft
with
whiskey
and
their
heads
were
soft
with
blows
a
wild
frolicking
drinking
fiddling
courting
riotous
a
sort
of
protestant
carnival
relaxing
the
grimness
of
puritanism
for
leagues
around
it
in
the
midst
of
such
a
community
and
partaking
of
all
its
influences
robert
dinsmore
the
author
of
the
poem
i
have
quoted
was
born
about
the
middle
of
the
last
century
his
paternal
ancestor
john
younger
son
of
a
laird
of
achenmead
who
left
the
banks
of
the
tweed
for
the
green
fertility
of
northern
ireland
had
emigrated
to
new
england
some
forty
years
before
and
after
a
rough
experience
of
indian
captivity
in
the
wild
woods
of
maine
had
settled
down
among
his
old
neighbors
in
londonderry
until
nine
years
of
age
robert
never
saw
a
school
he
was
a
short
time
under
the
tuition
of
an
old
british
soldier
who
had
strayed
into
the
settlement
after
the
french
war
at
which
time
he
says
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
i
learned
to
repeat
the
shorter
and
larger
catechisms
these
with
the
scripture
proofs
annexed
to
them
confirmed
me
in
the
orthodoxy
of
my
forefathers
and
i
hope
i
shall
ever
remain
an
evidence
of
the
truth
of
what
the
wise
man
said
up
a
child
in
the
way
he
should
go
and
when
he
is
old
he
will
not
depart
from
it
he
afterwards
took
lessons
with
one
master
mckeen
who
used
to
spend
much
of
his
time
in
hunting
squirrels
with
his
pupils
he
learned
to
read
and
write
and
the
old
man
always
insisted
that
he
should
have
done
well
at
ciphering
also
had
he
not
fallen
in
love
with
molly
park
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
enlisted
in
the
revolutionary
army
and
was
at
the
battle
of
saratoga
on
his
return
he
married
his
fair
molly
settled
down
as
a
farmer
in
windham
formerly
a
part
of
londonderry
and
before
he
was
thirty
years
of
age
became
an
elder
in
the
church
of
the
creed
and
observances
of
which
he
was
always
a
zealous
and
resolute
defender
from
occasional
passages
in
his
poems
it
is
evident
that
the
instructions
which
he
derived
from
the
pulpit
were
not
unlike
those
which
burns
suggested
as
needful
for
the
unlucky
lad
whom
he
was
commending
to
his
friend
hamilton
ye
catechise
him
ilka
quirk
an
shore
him
weel
wi
hell
in
a
humorous
poem
entitled
spring
lament
he
thus
describes
the
consternation
produced
in
the
at
sermon
time
by
a
dog
who
in
search
of
his
mistress
rattled
and
scraped
at
the
west
porch
door
the
vera
priest
was
scared
himsel
his
sermon
he
could
hardly
spell
auld
carlins
fancied
they
could
smell
the
brimstone
matches
they
thought
he
was
some
imp
o
hell
in
quest
o
wretches
he
lived
to
a
good
old
age
a
unpretending
farmer
cultivating
his
acres
with
his
own
horny
hands
and
cheering
the
long
rainy
days
and
winter
evenings
with
homely
rhyme
most
of
his
pieces
were
written
in
the
dialect
of
his
ancestors
which
was
well
understood
by
his
neighbors
and
friends
the
only
audience
upon
which
he
could
venture
to
calculate
he
loved
all
old
things
old
language
old
customs
old
theology
in
a
rhyming
letter
to
his
cousin
silas
he
says
though
death
our
ancestors
has
cleekit
an
under
clods
then
closely
steekit
we
mark
the
place
their
chimneys
reekit
their
native
tongue
we
yet
wad
speak
it
wi
accent
glib
he
wrote
sometimes
to
amuse
his
neighbors
often
to
soothe
their
sorrow
under
domestic
calamity
or
to
give
expression
to
his
own
with
little
of
that
delicacy
of
taste
which
results
from
the
attrition
of
fastidious
and
refined
society
and
altogether
too
truthful
and
to
call
in
the
aid
of
imagination
he
describes
in
the
simplest
and
most
direct
terms
the
circumstances
in
which
he
found
himself
and
the
impressions
which
these
circumstances
had
made
on
his
own
mind
he
calls
things
by
their
right
names
no
euphuism
or
transcendentalism
the
plainer
and
commoner
the
better
he
tells
us
of
his
farm
life
its
joys
and
sorrows
its
mirth
and
care
with
no
embellishment
with
no
concealment
of
repulsive
and
ungraceful
features
never
having
seen
a
nightingale
he
makes
no
attempt
to
describe
the
fowl
but
he
has
seen
the
at
sunset
cutting
the
air
above
him
and
he
tells
of
it
side
by
side
with
his
waving
and
we
have
the
and
pigsty
nothing
which
was
necessary
to
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
his
home
and
avocation
was
to
him
common
or
unclean
take
for
instance
the
following
from
a
poem
written
at
the
close
of
autumn
after
the
death
of
his
wife
no
more
may
i
the
spring
brook
trace
no
more
with
sorrow
view
the
place
where
mary
stood
no
more
may
wander
there
alone
and
lean
upon
the
mossy
stone
where
once
she
piled
her
wood
was
there
she
bleached
her
linen
cloth
by
yonder
tree
from
that
sweet
stream
she
made
her
broth
her
pudding
and
her
tea
that
stream
whose
waters
running
mossy
root
and
stone
made
ringing
and
singing
her
voice
could
match
alone
we
envy
not
the
man
who
can
sneer
at
this
simple
picture
it
is
honest
as
nature
herself
an
old
and
lonely
man
looks
back
upon
the
young
years
of
his
wedded
life
can
we
not
look
with
him
the
sunlight
of
a
summer
morning
is
weaving
itself
with
the
leafy
shadows
of
the
beneath
which
a
fair
and
young
woman
with
her
full
rounded
arms
bared
to
the
elbow
bends
not
ungracefully
to
her
task
pausing
ever
and
anon
to
play
with
the
child
beside
her
and
mingling
her
songs
with
the
pleasant
murmurings
of
gliding
water
alas
as
the
old
man
looks
he
hears
that
voice
which
perpetually
sounds
to
us
all
from
the
past
no
more
let
us
look
at
him
in
his
more
genial
mood
take
the
opening
lines
of
his
thanksgiving
day
what
a
plain
hearty
picture
of
substantial
comfort
when
corn
is
in
the
garret
stored
and
sauce
in
cellar
well
secured
when
good
fat
beef
we
can
afford
and
things
that
dainty
with
good
sweet
cider
on
our
board
and
pudding
plenty
when
stock
well
housed
may
chew
the
cud
and
at
my
door
a
pile
of
wood
a
rousing
fire
to
warm
my
blood
blest
sight
to
see
it
puts
my
rustic
muse
in
mood
to
sing
for
thee
if
he
needs
a
simile
he
takes
the
nearest
at
hand
in
a
letter
to
his
daughter
he
says
that
mine
is
not
a
longer
letter
the
cause
is
not
the
want
of
matter
of
that
there
plenty
worse
or
better
but
like
a
mill
whose
stream
beats
back
with
surplus
water
the
wheel
stands
still
something
of
the
humor
of
burns
gleams
out
occasionally
from
the
sober
decorum
of
his
verses
in
an
epistle
to
his
friend
betton
high
sheriff
of
the
county
who
had
sent
to
him
for
a
peck
of
seed
corn
he
says
soon
plantin
time
will
come
again
syne
may
the
heavens
gie
us
rain
an
shining
heat
to
bless
ilk
plain
an
fertile
hill

the
loads
o
yellow

garrets

long
as

me
for
naething
an
lose
your

and
on
receiving
a
copy
of
some
verses
written
by
a
lady
he
talks
in
a
sad
way
for
a
presbyterian
deacon
were
she
some
aborigine
squaw
wha
sings
so
sweet
by
nature
law
i
meet
her
in
a
hazle

or
some
green
loany
and
make
her
tawny
phiz
and
my
welcome
crony
the
practical
philosophy
of
the
stout
jovial
rhymer
was
but
little
affected
by
the
asceticism
of
the
elder
he
says
we
eat
and
drink
and
cheerful
take
our
portions
for
the
donor
sake

thus
the
word
of
wisdom

we
by
our
labors
make
the
lord

debtor
a
quaintly
characteristic
correspondence
in
rhyme
between
the
deacon
and
parson
mcgregore
evidently
birds
o
ane
feather
is
still
in
existence
the
minister
in
acknowledging
the
epistle
of
his
old
friend
commences
his
reply
as
follows
did
a
cuif
tak
up
a
quill
wha
did
aught
that
he
did
well
to

the

rant
and

flaunt
and
swagger
nae
doubt
ye
say
is
that
daft
chiel
old
dite
mcgregore
the
reply
is
in
the
same
strain
and
may
serve
to
give
the
reader
some
idea
of
the
old
gentleman
as
a
religious
controversialist
my
reverend
friend
and
kind
mcgregore
although

the
last
time
i
saw
him
he
was
chaffering
in
the
of
my
native
village
swapping
potatoes
and
onions
and
pumpkins
for
tea
coffee
molasses
and
if
the
truth
be
told
new
england
rum
threescore
years
and
ten
to
use
his
own
words
hung
his
back
and
bent
him
like
a
muckle
pack
yet
he
still
stood
stoutly
and
sturdily
in
his
thick
shoes
of
cowhide
like
one
accustomed
to
tread
independently
the
soil
of
his
own
acres
his
broad
honest
face
seamed
by
care
and
darkened
by
exposure
to
all
the
airts
that
blow
and
his
white
hair
flowing
in
patriarchal
glory
beneath
his
felt
hat
a
genial
jovial
old
man
simple
as
a
child
and
betraying
neither
in
look
nor
manner
that
he
was
accustomed
to
feed
on
thoughts
which
voluntary
move
harmonious
numbers
peace
to
him
a
score
of
modern
dandies
and
sentimentalists
could
ill
supply
the
place
of
this
one
honest
man
in
the
ancient
of
windham
by
the
side
of
his
beloved
molly
and
in
view
of
the
old
there
is
a
mound
of
earth
where
every
spring
green
grasses
tremble
in
the
wind
and
the
warm
sunshine
calls
out
the
flowers
there
gathered
like
one
of
his
own
ripe
sheaves
the
farmer
poet
sleeps
with
his
fathers
placido
the
slave
poet
i
have
been
greatly
interested
in
the
fate
of
juan
placido
the
black
revolutionist
of
cuba
who
was
executed
in
havana
as
the
alleged
instigator
and
leader
of
an
attempted
revolt
on
the
part
of
the
slaves
in
that
city
and
its
neighborhood
juan
placido
was
born
a
slave
on
the
estate
of
don
terribio
de
castro
his
father
was
an
african
his
mother
a
mulatto
his
mistress
treated
him
with
great
kindness
and
taught
him
to
read
when
he
was
twelve
years
of
age
she
died
and
he
fell
into
other
and
less
compassionate
hands
at
the
age
of
eighteen
on
seeing
his
mother
struck
with
a
heavy
whip
he
for
the
first
time
turned
upon
his
tormentors
to
use
his
own
words
i
felt
the
blow
in
my
heart
to
utter
a
loud
cry
and
from
a
downcast
boy
with
the
timidity
of
one
weak
as
a
lamb
to
become
all
at
office
like
a
raging
lion
was
a
thing
of
a
moment
he
was
however
subdued
and
the
next
morning
together
with
his
mother
a
tenderly
nurtured
and
delicate
woman
severely
scourged
on
seeing
his
mother
rudely
stripped
and
thrown
down
upon
the
ground
he
at
first
with
tears
implored
the
overseer
to
spare
her
but
at
the
sound
of
the
first
blow
as
it
cut
into
her
naked
flesh
he
sprang
once
more
upon
the
ruffian
who
having
superior
strength
beat
him
until
he
was
nearer
dead
than
alive
after
suffering
all
the
vicissitudes
of
slavery
hunger
nakedness
stripes
after
bravely
and
nobly
bearing
up
against
that
slow
dreadful
process
which
reduces
the
man
to
a
thing
the
image
of
god
to
a
piece
of
merchandise
until
he
had
reached
his
year
he
was
unexpectedly
released
from
his
bonds
some
literary
gentlemen
in
havana
into
whose
hands
two
or
three
pieces
of
his
composition
had
fallen
struck
with
the
vigor
spirit
and
natural
grace
which
they
manifested
sought
out
the
author
and
raised
a
subscription
to
purchase
his
freedom
he
came
to
havana
and
maintained
himself
by
and
such
other
employments
as
his
ingenuity
and
talents
placed
within
his
reach
he
wrote
several
poems
which
have
been
published
in
spanish
at
havana
and
translated
by
madden
under
the
title
of
by
a
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
of
these
poems
that
they
will
bear
a
comparison
with
most
of
the
productions
of
modern
spanish
literature
the
style
is
bold
free
energetic
some
of
the
pieces
are
sportive
and
graceful
such
is
the
address
to
or
cuban
firefly
this
beautiful
insect
is
sometimes
fastened
in
tiny
nets
to
the
light
dresses
of
the
cuban
ladies
a
custom
to
which
the
writer
gallantly
alludes
in
the
following
lines
ah
still
as
one
looks
on
such
brightness
and
bloom
on
such
beauty
as
hers
one
might
envy
the
doom
of
a
captive
cucuya
that
destined
like
this
to
be
touched
by
her
hand
and
revived
by
her
kiss
in
the
cage
which
her
delicate
hand
has
prepared
the
beautiful
prisoner
nestles
unscared
her
fair
forehead
shining
serenely
and
bright
in
beauty
own
bondage
revealing
its
light
and
when
the
light
dance
and
the
revel
are
done
she
bears
it
away
to
her
alcove
alone
where
fed
by
her
hand
from
the
cane
that
most
choice
in
secret
it
gleans
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
o
beautiful
maiden
may
heaven
accord
thy
care
of
the
captive
a
fitting
reward
and
never
may
fortune
the
fetters
remove
of
a
heart
that
is
thine
in
the
bondage
of
love
in
his
dream
a
fragment
of
some
length
placido
dwells
in
a
touching
manner
upon
the
scenes
of
his
early
years
it
is
addressed
to
his
brother
florence
who
was
a
slave
near
matanzas
while
the
author
was
in
the
same
condition
at
havana
there
is
a
plaintive
and
melancholy
sweetness
in
these
lines
a
natural
pathos
which
finds
its
way
to
the
heart
thou
knowest
dear
florence
my
sufferings
of
old
the
struggles
maintained
with
oppression
for
years
we
shared
them
together
and
each
was
consoled
with
the
love
which
was
nurtured
by
sorrow
and
tears
but
now
far
apart
the
sad
pleasure
is
gone
we
mingle
our
sighs
and
our
sorrows
no
more
the
course
is
a
new
one
which
each
has
to
run
and
dreary
for
each
is
the
pathway
before
but
in
slumber
our
spirits
at
least
shall
commune
we
will
meet
as
of
old
in
the
visions
of
sleep
in
dreams
which
call
back
early
days
when
at
noon
we
stole
to
the
shade
of
the
to
weep
for
solitude
pining
in
anguish
of
late
the
heights
of
quintana
i
sought
for
repose
and
there
in
the
cool
and
the
silence
the
weight
of
my
cares
was
forgotten
i
felt
not
any
woes
exhausted
and
weary
the
spell
of
the
place
sank
down
on
my
eyelids
and
soft
slumber
stole
so
sweetly
upon
me
it
left
not
a
trace
of
sorrow
the
light
of
the
soul
the
writer
then
imagines
himself
borne
lightly
through
the
air
to
the
place
of
his
birth
the
valley
of
matanzas
lies
beneath
him
hallowed
by
the
graves
of
his
parents
he
proceeds
i
gazed
on
that
spot
where
together
we
played
our
innocent
pastimes
came
fresh
to
my
mind
our
mother
caress
and
the
fondness
displayed
in
each
word
and
each
look
of
a
parent
so
kind
i
looked
on
the
mountain
whose
fastnesses
wild
the
fugitives
seek
from
the
rifle
and
hound
below
were
the
fields
where
they
suffered
and
toiled
and
there
the
low
graves
of
their
comrades
are
found
the
was
there
and
the
turmoil
of
old
but
sick
of
these
scenes
for
too
well
were
they
known
i
looked
for
the
stream
where
in
childhood
i
strolled
when
a
moment
of
quiet
and
peace
was
my
own
with
mingled
emotions
of
pleasure
and
pain
dear
florence
i
sighed
to
behold
thee
once
more
i
sought
thee
my
brother
embraced
thee
again
but
i
found
thee
a
slave
as
i
left
thee
before
some
of
his
devotional
pieces
evince
the
fervor
and
true
feeling
of
the
christian
poet
his
to
contains
many
admirable
lines
speaking
of
the
martyrs
of
the
early
days
of
christianity
he
says
finely
still
in
that
cradle
purpled
with
their
blood
the
infant
faith
waxed
stronger
day
by
day
i
can
not
forbear
quoting
the
last
stanza
of
this
poem
o
god
of
mercy
throned
in
glory
high
on
earth
and
all
its
misery
look
down
behold
the
wretched
hear
the
captive
cry
and
call
thy
exiled
children
round
thy
throne
there
would
i
fain
in
contemplation
gaze
on
thy
eternal
beauty
and
would
make
of
love
one
lasting
canticle
of
praise
and
every
theme
but
thee
henceforth
forsake
his
best
and
noblest
production
is
an
ode
written
on
the
occasion
of
madden
departure
from
the
island
and
presented
to
that
gentleman
it
was
never
published
in
cuba
as
its
sentiments
would
have
subjected
the
author
to
persecution
it
breathes
a
lofty
spirit
of
patriotism
and
an
indignant
sense
of
the
wrongs
inflicted
upon
his
race
withal
it
has
something
of
the
grandeur
and
stateliness
of
the
old
spanish
muse
cuba
of
what
avail
that
thou
art
fair
pearl
of
the
seas
the
pride
of
the
antilles
if
thy
poor
sons
have
still
to
see
thee
share
the
pangs
of
bondage
and
its
thousand
ills
of
what
avail
the
verdure
of
thy
hills
the
purple
bloom
thy
displays
the
cane
luxuriant
growth
whose
culture
fills
more
graves
than
famine
or
the
sword
finds
ways
to
glut
with
victims
calmly
as
it
slays
of
what
avail
that
thy
clear
streams
abound
with
precious
ore
if
wealth
there
none
to
buy
thy
children
rights
and
not
one
grain
is
found

or
for
the
altar

of
poor
forsaken
downcast
liberty
of
what
avail
the
riches
of
thy
port
forests
of
masts
and
ships
from
every

if

alone
is
free

the

oh
say
to
those
who
mock
thee
with
such
wiles
take
off
these
flowers
and
view
the
lifeless
spoils
which
wait
the

behold
their
hues
beneath
the
pale
cold

seek
for
living

where

not
in
the
arms
of

and

taints
not
with
its
poison
breath
the
disastrous
result
of
the
last
rising
of
the
slaves
in
cuba
is
well
known
betrayed
and
driven
into
premature
collision
with
their
oppressors
the
insurrectionists
were
speedily
crushed
into
subjection
placido
was
arrested
and
after
a
long
hearing
was
condemned
to
be
executed
and
consigned
to
the
chapel
of
the
condemned
how
far
he
was
implicated
in
the
insurrectionary
movement
it
is
now
perhaps
impossible
to
ascertain
the
popular
voice
at
havana
pronounced
him
its
leader
and
projector
and
as
such
he
was
condemned
his
own
bitter
wrongs
the
terrible
recollections
of
his
life
of
servitude
the
sad
condition
of
his
relatives
and
race
exposed
to
scorn
contumely
and
the
heavy
hand
of
violence
the
impunity
with
which
the
most
dreadful
outrages
upon
the
persons
of
slaves
were
inflicted
acting
upon
a
mind
fully
capable
of
appreciating
the
beauty
and
dignity
of
freedom
furnished
abundant
incentives
to
an
effort
for
the
redemption
of
his
race
and
the
humiliation
of
his
oppressors
the
heraldo
of
madrid
speaks
of
him
as
the
celebrated
poet
a
man
of
great
natural
genius
and
beloved
and
appreciated
by
the
most
respectable
young
men
of
havana
it
accuses
him
of
wild
and
ambitious
projects
and
states
that
he
was
intended
to
be
the
chief
of
the
black
race
after
they
had
thrown
off
the
yoke
of
bondage
he
was
executed
at
havana
in
the
seventh
month
according
to
the
custom
in
cuba
with
condemned
criminals
he
was
conducted
from
prison
to
the
chapel
of
the
doomed
he
passed
thither
with
singular
composure
amidst
a
great
concourse
of
people
gracefully
saluting
his
numerous
acquaintances
the
chapel
was
hung
with
black
cloth
and
dimly
lighted
he
was
seated
beside
his
coffin
priests
in
long
black
robes
stood
around
him
chanting
in
sepulchral
voices
the
service
of
the
dead
it
is
an
ordeal
under
which
the
and
most
resolute
have
been
found
to
sink
after
enduring
it
for
hours
he
was
led
out
to
execution
he
came
forth
calm
and
undismayed
holding
a
crucifix
in
his
hand
he
recited
in
a
loud
clear
voice
a
solemn
prayer
in
verse
which
he
had
composed
amidst
the
horrors
of
the
chapel
the
following
is
an
imperfect
rendering
of
a
poem
which
thrilled
the
hearts
of
all
who
heard
it
god
of
unbounded
love
and
power
eternal
to
thee
i
turn
in
darkness
and
despair
stretch
forth
thine
arm
and
from
the
brow
infernal
of
calumny
the
veil
of
justice
tear
and
from
the
forehead
of
my
honest
fame
pluck
the
world
brand
of
infamy
and
shame
o
king
of
kings
my
fathers
god
who
only
art
strong
to
save
by
whom
is
all
controlled
who
givest
the
sea
its
waves
the
dark
and
lonely
abyss
of
heaven
its
light
the
north
its
cold
the
air
its
currents
the
warm
sun
its
beams
life
to
the
flowers
and
motion
to
the
streams
all
things
obey
thee
dying
or
reviving
as
thou
commandest
all
apart
from
thee
from
thee
alone
their
life
and
power
deriving
sink
and
are
lost
in
vast
eternity
yet
doth
the
void
obey
thee
since
from
naught
this
marvellous
being
by
thy
hand
was
wrought
o
merciful
god
i
can
not
shun
thy
presence
for
through
its
veil
of
flesh
thy
piercing
eye
looketh
upon
my
spirit
unsoiled
essence
as
through
the
pure
transparence
of
the
sky
let
not
the
oppressor
clap
his
bloody
hands
as
my
prostrate
innocence
he
stands
but
if
alas
it
seemeth
good
to
thee
that
i
should
perish
as
the
guilty
dies
and
that
in
death
my
foes
should
gaze
on
me
with
hateful
malice
and
exulting
eyes
speak
thou
the
word
and
bid
them
shed
my
blood
fully
in
me
thy
will
be
done
o
god
on
arriving
at
the
fatal
spot
he
sat
down
as
ordered
on
a
bench
with
his
back
to
the
soldiers
the
multitude
recollected
that
in
some
affecting
lines
written
by
the
conspirator
in
prison
he
had
said
that
it
would
be
useless
to
seek
to
kill
him
by
shooting
his
body
that
his
heart
must
be
pierced
ere
it
would
cease
its
throbbings
at
the
last
moment
just
as
the
soldiers
were
about
to
fire
he
rose
up
and
gazed
for
an
instant
around
and
above
him
on
the
beautiful
capital
of
his
native
land
and
its
bay
on
the
dense
crowds
about
him
the
blue
mountains
in
the
distance
and
the
sky
glorious
with
summer
sunshine
adios
mundo
farewell
world
he
said
calmly
and
sat
down
the
word
was
given
and
five
balls
entered
his
body
then
it
was
that
amidst
the
groans
and
murmurs
of
the
spectators
he
rose
up
once
more
and
turned
his
head
to
the
shuddering
soldiers
his
face
wearing
an
expression
of
superhuman
courage
will
no
one
pity
me
he
said
laying
his
hand
over
his
heart
here
fire
here
while
he
yet
spake
two
balls
entered
his
heart
and
he
fell
dead
thus
perished
the
hero
poet
of
cuba
he
has
not
fallen
in
vain
his
genius
and
his
heroic
death
will
doubtless
be
regarded
by
his
race
as
precious
legacies
to
the
great
names
of
and
petion
the
colored
man
can
now
add
that
of
juan
placido
personal
sketches
and
tributes
the
funeral
of
torrey
charles
torrey
an
able
young
congregational
clergyman
died
may
in
the
state
prison
of
maryland
for
the
offence
of
aiding
slaves
to
escape
from
bondage
his
funeral
in
boston
attended
by
thousands
was
a
most
impressive
occasion
the
following
is
an
extract
from
an
article
written
for
the
some
seven
years
ago
we
saw
charles
torrey
for
the
first
time
his
wife
was
leaning
on
his
arm
young
loving
and
beautiful
the
heart
that
saw
them
blessed
them
since
that
time
we
have
known
him
as
a
most
energetic
and
zealous
advocate
of
the
cause
he
had
fine
talents
improved
by
learning
and
observation
a
clear
intensely
active
intellect
and
a
heart
full
of
sympathy
and
genial
humanity
it
was
with
strange
and
bitter
feelings
that
we
bent
over
his
coffin
and
looked
upon
his
still
face
the
pity
which
we
had
felt
for
him
in
his
long
sufferings
gave
place
to
indignation
against
his
murderers
hateful
beyond
the
power
of
expression
seemed
the
tyranny
which
had
murdered
him
with
the
slow
torture
of
the
dungeon
may
god
forgive
us
if
for
the
moment
we
felt
like
grasping
his
dread
prerogative
of
vengeance
as
we
passed
out
of
the
hall
a
friend
grasped
our
hand
hard
his
eye
flashing
through
its
tears
with
a
stern
reflection
of
our
own
emotions
while
he
whispered
through
his
pressed
lips
it
is
enough
to
turn
every
slavery
heart
into
steel
our
blood
boiled
we
longed
to
see
the
wicked
apologists
of
slavery
the
blasphemous
defenders
of
it
in
church
and
state
led
up
to
the
coffin
of
our
murdered
brother
and
there
made
to
feel
that
their
hands
had
aided
in
riveting
the
chain
upon
those
still
limbs
and
in
shutting
out
from
those
cold
lips
the
free
breath
of
heaven
a
long
procession
followed
his
remains
to
their
at
mount
auburn
a
monument
to
his
memory
will
be
raised
in
that
cemetery
in
the
midst
of
the
green
beauty
of
the
scenery
which
he
loved
in
life
and
side
by
side
with
the
honored
dead
of
massachusetts
thither
let
the
friends
of
humanity
go
to
gather
fresh
strength
from
the
memory
of
the
martyr
there
let
the
slaveholder
stand
and
as
he
reads
the
record
of
the
enduring
marble
commune
with
his
own
heart
and
feel
that
sorrow
which
worketh
repentance
the
young
the
beautiful
the
brave
he
is
safe
now
from
the
malice
of
his
enemies
nothing
can
harm
him
more
his
work
for
the
poor
and
helpless
was
well
and
nobly
done
in
the
wild
woods
of
canada
around
many
a
happy
fireside
and
holy
family
altar
his
name
is
on
the
lips
of
god
poor
he
put
his
soul
in
their
souls
stead
he
gave
his
life
for
those
who
had
no
claim
on
his
love
save
that
of
human
brotherhood
how
poor
how
pitiful
and
paltry
seem
our
labors
how
small
and
mean
our
trials
and
sacrifices
may
the
spirit
of
the
dead
be
with
us
and
infuse
into
our
hearts
something
of
his
own
deep
sympathy
his
hatred
of
injustice
his
strong
faith
and
heroic
endurance
may
that
spirit
be
gladdened
in
its
present
sphere
by
the
increased
zeal
and
faithfulness
of
the
friends
he
has
left
behind
edward
everett
a
letter
to
robert
waterston
amesbury
month
i
acknowledge
through
thee
the
invitation
of
the
standing
committee
of
the
massachusetts
historical
society
to
be
present
at
a
special
meeting
of
the
society
for
the
purpose
of
paying
a
tribute
to
the
memory
of
our
late
illustrious
associate
edward
everett
it
is
a
matter
of
deep
regret
to
me
that
the
state
of
my
health
will
not
permit
me
to
be
with
you
on
an
occasion
of
so
much
interest
it
is
most
fitting
that
the
members
of
the
historical
society
of
massachusetts
should
add
their
tribute
to
those
which
have
been
already
offered
by
all
sects
parties
and
associations
to
the
name
and
fame
of
their
late
associate
he
was
himself
a
maker
of
history
and
part
and
parcel
of
all
the
noble
charities
and
humanizing
influences
of
his
state
and
time
when
the
grave
closed
over
him
who
added
new
lustre
to
the
old
and
honored
name
of
quincy
all
eyes
instinctively
turned
to
edward
everett
as
the
last
of
that
venerated
class
of
patriotic
civilians
who
outliving
all
dissent
and
jealousy
and
party
prejudice
held
their
reputation
by
the
secure
tenure
of
the
universal
appreciation
of
its
worth
as
a
common
treasure
of
the
republic
it
is
not
for
me
to
pronounce
his
eulogy
others
better
qualified
by
their
intimate
acquaintance
with
him
have
done
and
will
do
justice
to
his
learning
eloquence
varied
culture
and
social
virtues
my
secluded
country
life
has
afforded
me
few
opportunities
of
personal
intercourse
with
him
while
my
pronounced
radicalism
on
the
great
question
which
has
divided
popular
feeling
rendered
our
political
paths
widely
divergent
both
of
us
early
saw
the
danger
which
threatened
the
country
in
the
language
of
the
prophet
we
saw
the
sword
coming
upon
the
land
but
while
he
believed
in
the
possibility
of
averting
it
by
concession
and
compromise
i
on
the
contrary
as
firmly
believed
that
such
a
course
could
only
strengthen
and
confirm
what
i
regarded
as
a
gigantic
conspiracy
against
the
rights
and
liberties
the
union
and
the
life
of
the
nation
recent
events
have
certainly
not
tended
to
change
this
belief
on
my
part
but
in
looking
over
the
past
while
i
see
little
or
nothing
to
retract
in
the
matter
of
opinion
i
am
saddened
by
the
reflection
that
through
the
very
intensity
of
my
convictions
i
may
have
done
injustice
to
the
motives
of
those
with
whom
i
differed
as
respects
edward
everett
it
seems
to
me
that
only
within
the
last
four
years
i
have
truly
known
him
in
that
brief
period
crowded
as
it
is
with
a
whole
of
consecration
to
the
union
freedom
and
glory
of
his
country
he
not
only
commanded
respect
and
reverence
but
concentrated
upon
himself
in
a
most
remarkable
degree
the
love
of
all
loyal
and
generous
hearts
we
have
seen
in
these
years
of
trial
very
great
sacrifices
offered
upon
the
altar
of
patriotism
wealth
ease
home
love
life
itself
but
edward
everett
did
more
than
this
he
laid
on
that
altar
not
only
his
time
talents
and
culture
but
his
pride
of
opinion
his
views
of
policy
his
personal
and
political
predilections
and
prejudices
his
constitutional
fastidiousness
of
conservatism
and
the
carefully
elaborated
symmetry
of
his
public
reputation
with
a
rare
and
noble
magnanimity
he
met
without
hesitation
the
demand
of
the
great
occasion
breaking
away
from
all
the
besetments
of
custom
and
association
he
forgot
the
things
that
are
behind
and
with
an
eye
single
to
present
duty
pressed
forward
towards
the
mark
of
the
high
calling
of
divine
providence
in
the
events
of
our
time
all
honor
to
him
if
we
mourn
that
he
is
now
beyond
the
reach
of
our
poor
human
praise
let
us
reverently
trust
that
he
has
received
that
higher
plaudit
well
done
thou
good
and
faithful
servant
when
i
last
met
him
as
my
colleague
in
the
electoral
college
of
massachusetts
his
look
of
health
and
vigor
seemed
to
promise
us
many
years
of
his
wisdom
and
usefulness
on
greeting
him
i
felt
impelled
to
express
my
admiration
and
grateful
appreciation
of
his
patriotic
labors
and
i
shall
never
forget
how
readily
and
gracefully
he
turned
attention
from
himself
to
the
great
cause
in
which
we
had
a
common
interest
and
expressed
his
thankfulness
that
he
had
still
a
country
to
serve
to
keep
green
the
memory
of
such
a
man
is
at
once
a
privilege
and
a
duty
that
stainless
life
of
seventy
years
is
a
priceless
legacy
his
hands
were
pure
the
shadow
of
suspicion
never
fell
on
him
if
he
erred
in
his
opinions
and
that
he
did
so
he
had
the
christian
grace
and
courage
to
own
no
selfish
interest
weighed
in
the
scale
of
his
judgment
against
truth
as
our
thoughts
follow
him
to
his
last
we
are
sadly
reminded
of
his
own
touching
lines
written
many
years
ago
at
florence
the
name
he
has
left
behind
is
none
the
less
pure
that
instead
of
being
humble
as
he
then
anticipated
it
is
on
the
lips
of
grateful
millions
and
written
ineffaceable
on
the
record
of
his
country
trial
and
triumph
yet
not
for
me
when
i
shall
fall
asleep
shall
santa
croce
lamps
their
vigils
keep
beyond
the
main
in
auburn
quiet
shade
with
those
i
loved
and
love
my
couch
be
made
spring
pendant
branches
the
hillock
wave
and
morning
dewdrops
glisten
on
my
grave
while
heaven
great
arch
shall
rise
above
my
bed
when
santa
croce
crumbles
on
her
dead
unknown
to
erring
or
to
suffering
fame
so
may
i
leave
a
pure
though
humble
name
congratulating
the
society
on
the
prospect
of
the
speedy
consummation
of
the
great
objects
of
our
associate
labors
the
peace
and
permanent
union
of
our
country

am
very
truly
thy
friend
lewis
tappan
one
after
another
those
foremost
in
the
antislavery
conflict
of
the
last
half
century
are
rapidly
passing
away
the
grave
has
just
closed
over
all
that
was
mortal
of
salmon
chase
the
kingliest
of
men
a
statesman
second
to
no
other
in
our
history
too
great
and
pure
for
the
presidency
yet
leaving
behind
him
a
record
which
any
incumbent
of
that
station
might
envy
and
now
the
telegraph
brings
us
the
tidings
of
the
death
of
lewis
tappan
of
brooklyn
so
long
and
so
honorably
identified
with
the
slavery
cause
and
with
every
philanthropic
and
christian
enterprise
he
was
a
native
of
massachusetts
born
at
northampton
in
of
puritan
lineage
one
of
a
family
remarkable
for
integrity
decision
of
character
and
intellectual
ability
at
the
very
outset
in
company
with
his
brother
arthur
he
devoted
his
time
talents
wealth
and
social
position
to
the
righteous
but
unpopular
cause
of
emancipation
and
became
in
consequence
a
mark
for
the
persecution
which
followed
such
devotion
his
business
was
crippled
his
name
cast
out
as
evil
his
dwelling
sacked
and
his
furniture
dragged
into
the
street
and
burned
yet
he
never
in
the
darkest
hour
faltered
or
hesitated
for
a
moment
he
knew
he
was
right
and
that
the
end
would
justify
him
one
of
the
cheerfullest
of
men
he
was
strong
where
others
were
weak
hopeful
where
others
despaired
he
was
wise
in
counsel
and
prompt
in
action
like
tennyson
sir
galahad
his
strength
was
as
the
strength
of
ten
because
his
heart
was
pure
i
met
him
for
the
first
time
forty
years
ago
at
the
convention
which
formed
the
american
society
where
i
chanced
to
sit
by
him
as
one
of
the
secretaries
myself
young
and
inexperienced
i
remember
how
profoundly
i
was
impressed
by
his
cool
clearness
of
perception
and
wonderful
executive
ability
had
he
devoted
himself
to
party
politics
with
half
the
zeal
which
he
manifested
in
behalf
of
those
who
had
no
votes
to
give
and
no
honors
to
bestow
he
could
have
reached
the
highest
offices
in
the
land
he
chose
his
course
knowing
all
that
he
renounced
and
he
chose
it
wisely
he
never
at
least
regretted
it
and
now
at
the
ripe
age
of
years
the
brave
old
man
has
passed
onward
to
the
higher
life
having
outlived
here
all
hatred
abuse
and
misrepresentation
having
seen
the
great
work
of
emancipation
completed
and
white
men
and
black
men
equal
before
the
law
i
saw
him
for
the
last
time
three
years
ago
when
he
was
preparing
his
valuable
biography
of
his
beloved
brother
arthur
age
had
begun
to
tell
upon
his
constitution
but
his
intellectual
force
was
not
abated
the
old
pleasant
laugh
and
playful
humor
remained
he
looked
forward
to
the
close
of
life
hopefully
even
cheerfully
as
he
called
to
mind
the
dear
friends
who
had
passed
on
before
him
to
await
his
coming
of
the
signers
of
the
declaration
at
the
philadelphia
convention
in
probably
not
more
than
eight
or
ten
are
now
living
as
clouds
that
rake
the
mountain
summits
as
waves
that
know
no
guiding
hand
so
swift
has
brother
followed
brother
from
sunshine
to
the
sunless
land
yet
it
is
a
noteworthy
fact
that
the
oldest
member
of
that
convention
david
thurston
of
maine
lived
to
see
the
slaves
emancipated
and
to
mingle
his
voice
of
thanksgiving
with
the
bells
that
rang
in
the
day
of
universal
freedom

january
i
am
not
able
to
attend
the
memorial
meeting
in
tremont
temple
on
the
instant
but
my
heart
responds
to
any
testimonial
appreciative
of
the
intellectual
achievements
and
the
noble
and
manly
life
of
bayard
taylor
more
than
thirty
years
have
intervened
between
my
first
meeting
him
in
the
fresh
bloom
of
his
youth
and
hope
and
honorable
ambition
and
my
last
parting
with
him
under
the
elms
of
boston
common
after
our
visit
to
richard
dana
on
the
occasion
of
the
ninetieth
anniversary
of
that
honored
father
of
american
poetry
still
living
to
lament
the
death
of
his
younger
disciple
and
friend
how
much
he
has
accomplished
in
these
years
the
most
industrious
of
men
slowly
patiently
under
many
disadvantages
he
built
up
his
splendid
reputation
traveller
editor
novelist
translator
diplomatist
and
through
all
and
above
all
poet
what
he
was
he
owed
wholly
to
himself
his
native
honesty
was
satisfied
with
no
half
tasks
he
finished
as
he
went
and
always
said
and
did
his
best
it
is
perhaps
too
early
to
assign
him
his
place
in
american
literature
his
picturesque
books
of
travel
his
oriental
lyrics
his
pennsylvanian
idyls
his
centennial
ode
the
pastoral
beauty
and
christian
sweetness
of
lars
and
the
high
argument
and
rhythmic
marvel
of
deukalion
are
sureties
of
the
permanence
of
his
reputation
but
at
this
moment
my
thoughts
dwell
rather
upon
the
man
than
the
author
the
calamity
of
his
death
felt
in
both
hemispheres
is
to
me
and
to
all
who
intimately
knew
and
loved
him
a
heavy
personal
loss
under
the
shadow
of
this
bereavement
in
the
inner
circle
of
mourning
we
sorrow
most
of
all
that
we
shall
see
his
face
no
more
and
long
for
the
touch
of
a
vanished
hand
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
that
is
still

danvers
i
scarcely
need
say
that
i
yield
to
no
one
in
love
and
reverence
for
the
great
and
good
man
whose
memory
outliving
all
prejudices
of
creed
sect
and
party
is
the
common
legacy
of
christendom
as
the
years
go
on
the
value
of
that
legacy
will
be
more
and
more
felt
not
so
much
perhaps
in
doctrine
as
in
spirit
in
those
utterances
of
a
devout
soul
which
are
above
and
beyond
the
affirmation
or
negation
of
dogma
his
ethical
severity
and
christian
tenderness
his
hatred
of
wrong
and
oppression
with
love
and
pity
for
the
his
noble
pleas
for
temperance
peace
and
purity
and
above
all
his
precept
and
example
of
unquestioning
obedience
to
duty
and
the
voice
of
god
in
his
soul
can
never
become
obsolete
it
is
very
fitting
that
his
memory
should
be
especially
cherished
with
that
of
hopkins
and
berkeley
in
the
beautiful

to
which
the
common

a

i
regret
that
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
join
the
citizens
of
amesbury
and
salisbury
in
the
memorial
services
on
the
occasion
of
the
death
of
our
lamented
president
but
in
heart
and
sympathy
i
am
with
you
i
share
the
great
sorrow
which
overshadows
the
land
i
fully
appreciate
the
irretrievable
loss
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
occasion
is
one
for
thankfulness
as
well
as
grief
through
all
the
stages
of
the
solemn
tragedy
which
has
just
closed
with
the
death
of
our
noblest
and
best
i
have
felt
that
the
divine
providence
was
overruling
the
mighty
affliction
that
the
patient
sufferer
at
washington
was
drawing
with
cords
of
sympathy
all
sections
and
parties
nearer
to
each
other
and
now
when
south
and
north
democrat
and
republican
radical
and
conservative
lift
their
voices
in
one
unbroken
accord
of
lamentation
when
i
see
how
in
spite
of
the
greed
of
gain
the
lust
of
office
the
strifes
and
narrowness
of
party
politics
the
great
heart
of
the
nation
proves
sound
and
loyal
i
feel
a
new
hope
for
the
republic
i
have
a
firmer
faith
in
its
stability
it
is
said
that
no
man
liveth
and
no
man
dieth
to
himself
and
the
pure
and
noble
life
of
garfield
and
his
slow
long
martyrdom
so
bravely
borne
in
view
of
all
are
i
believe
bearing
for
us
as
a
people
the
peaceable
fruits
of
righteousness
we
are
stronger
wiser
better
for
them
with
him
it
is
well
his
mission
fulfilled
he
goes
to
his
grave
by
the
lakeside
honored
and
lamented
as
man
never
was
before
the
whole
world
mourns
him
there
is
no
speech
nor
language
where
the
voice
of
his
praise
is
not
heard
about
his
grave
gather
with
heads
uncovered
the
vast
brotherhood
of
man
and
with
us
it
is
well
also
we
are
nearer
a
united
people
than
ever
before
we
are
at
peace
with
all
our

full
of

hopeful
god
grant
that
while
our
material
interests
prosper
the
moral
and
spiritual
influence
of
the
occasion
may
be
permanently
felt
that
the
solemn
sacrament
of
sorrow
whereof
we
have
been
made
partakers
may
be
blest
to
the
promotion
of

deemed

a

citizen
of

brother

afterwards
theological
professor
in

college
was
some
years
older
than
herself
and
assisted
her
in
her
early
home
studies
though
with
the
perversity
of
an
elder
brother
he
sometimes
mystified
her
in
answering
her
questions
once
when
she
wished
to
know
what
was
meant
by
milton
raven
down
of
darkness
which
was
made
to
smile
when
smoothed

explained
that
it
was
only

fur
of

cat
which
sparkled
when
stroked

in
life

wrote
of
her

has
been
a
dear
good
sister
to
me
would
that
i
had
been
half
as
good
a
brother
to
her

earliest
teacher
was
an
aged
spinster
known
in
the
village
as

shy
and
with
many
oddities
of
person
and
manner
the
forgotten
calamity
of
whose
life
was

once
saw
her
drinking
out
of
the
nose
of
her
her
school
was
in
her
bedroom
always
untidy
and
she
was
a
constant
chewer
of
tobacco
but
the
children
were
fond
of
her

always
carried
her

immense
chicken

pie
made
in

and
heaps
of

they
feasted
in

large
kitchen
and
went
away
loaded
with
crackers
and
bread
and
pies
not
forgetting
for
the
children
such
plain
application
of
the
doctrine
that
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
receive
may
have
done
more
to
mould
the
character
of

maria
child
of
maturer
years
than
all
the
faithful
labors
of
good
osgood
to
whom
she
and
her
brother
used
to
repeat
the
assembly
catechism
once
a
month
her
education
was
limited
to
the
public
schools
with
the
exception
of
one
year
at
a
private
seminary
in
her
native
town
from
a
note
by
her
brother
francis
we
learn
that
when
twelve
years
of
age
she
went
to
norridgewock
maine
where
her
married
sister
resided
at
brown
in
skowhegan
she
first
read
she
was
greatly
excited
and
exclaimed
as
she
laid
down
the
book
why
can
not
i
write
a
novel
she
remained
in
norridgewock
and
vicinity
for
several
years
and
on
her
return
to
massachusetts
took
up
her
abode
with
her
brother
at
watertown
he
encouraged
her
literary
tastes
and
it
was
in
his
study
that
she
commenced
her
first
story
which
she
published
in
the
first
year
of
her
age
the
success
it
met
with
induced
her
to
give
to
the
public
soon
after
rebels
a
tale
of
the
which
was
at
once
received
into
popular
favor
and
ran
rapidly
through
several
editions
then
followed
in
close
succession

running
through
eight
american
editions
twelve
english
and
one
german
girl
the
of
and
the
of
which
editions
were
published
her
was
commenced
in
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
half
a
century
ago
she
was
the
most
popular
literary
woman
in
the
united
states
she
had
published
historical
novels
of
unquestioned
power
of
description
and
characterization
and
was
widely
and
favorably
known
as
the
editor
of
the
which
was
probably
the
first
periodical
in
the
english
tongue
devoted
exclusively
to
children
and
to
which
she
was
by
far
the
largest
contributor
some
of
the
tales
and
poems
from
her
pen
were
extensively
copied
and
greatly
admired
it
was
at
this
period
that
the
american
the
highest
literary
authority
of
the
country
said
of
her
we
are
not
sure
that
any
woman
of
our
country
could
outrank
child
this
lady
has
been
long
before
the
public
as
an
author
with
much
success
and
she
well
deserves
it
for
in
all
her
works
nothing
can
be
found
which
does
not
commend
itself
by
its
tone
of
healthy
morality
and
good
sense
few
female
writers
if
any
have
done
more
or
better
things
for
our
literature
in
the
lighter
or
graver
departments
comparatively
young
she
had
placed
herself
in
the
front
rank
of
american
authorship
her
books
and
her
magazine
had
a
large
circulation
and
were
affording
her
a
comfortable
income
at
a
time
when
the
rewards
of
authorship
were
uncertain
and
at
the
best
scanty
in
she
married
david
lee

a
young
and
able
lawyer
and
took
up
her
residence
in
boston
in
both
became
deeply
interested
in
the
subject
of

writings
and
personal
influence
of

her
husband

at
an
earlier
date
denounced

project
of

for
the
purpose
of
strengthening
and
extending
american
slavery
he
was
one
of
the
earliest
members
of
the
new
england
society
and
his
outspoken
hostility
to
the
peculiar
institution
greatly
and
unfavorably
affected
his
interests
as
a
lawyer
in
he
addressed
a
series
of
able
letters
on
slavery

and

its

were

and
it
was
everywhere
spoken
against
it
was
at
this
time
that
lydia

child
startled
the
country
by
the
publication
of
her
noble
in
behalf
of
that
class
of
americans
called
it
is
quite
impossible
for
any
one
of
the
present
generation
to
imagine
the
popular
surprise
and
indignation
which
the
book
called
forth
or
how
entirely
its
author
cut
herself
off
from
the
favor
and
sympathy
of
a
large
number
of
those
who
had
previously
delighted
to
do
her
honor
social
and
literary
circles
which
had
been
proud
of
her
presence
closed
their
doors
against
her
the
sale
of
her
books
the
subscriptions
to
her
magazine
fell
off
to
a
ruinous
extent
she
knew
all
she
was
hazarding
and
made
the
great
sacrifice
prepared
for
all
the
consequences
which
followed
in
the
preface
to
her
book
she
says
i
am
fully
aware
of
the
unpopularity
of
the
task
i
have
undertaken
but
though
i
expect
ridicule
and
censure
i
do
not
fear
them
a
few
years
hence
the
opinion
of
the
world
will
be
a
matter
in
which
i
have
not
even
the
most
transient
interest
but
this
book
will
be
abroad
on
its
mission
of
humanity
long
after
the
hand
that
wrote
it
is
mingling
with
the
dust
should
it
be
the
means
of
advancing
even
one
single
hour
the
inevitable
progress
of
truth
and
justice
i
would
not
exchange
the
consciousness
for
all
rothschild
wealth
or
sir
walter
fame
thenceforth
her
life
was
a
battle
a
constant
rowing
hard
against
the
stream
of
popular
prejudice
and
hatred
and
through
it
all
pecuniary
privation
loss
of
friends
and
position
the
painfulness
of
being
suddenly
thrust
from
the
still
air
of
delightful
studies
into
the
bitterest
and
sternest
controversy
of
the
age
she
bore
herself
with
patience
fortitude
and
unshaken
reliance
upon
the
justice
and
ultimate
triumph
of
the
cause
she
had
espoused
her
pen
was
never
idle
wherever
there
was
a
brave
word
to
be
spoken
her
voice
was
heard
and
never
without
effect
it
is
not
exaggeration
to
say
that
no
man
or
woman
at
that
period
rendered
more
substantial
service
to
the
cause
of
freedom
or
made
such
a
great
renunciation
in
doing
it
a
practical
philanthropist
she
had
the
courage
of
her
convictions
and
from
the
first
was
no
mere
closet
moralist
or
sentimental
bewailer
of
the
woes
of
humanity
she
was
the
samaritan
stooping
over
the
wounded
jew
she
calmly
and
unflinchingly
took
her
place
by
the
side
of
the
despised
slave
and
free
man
of
color
and
in
word
and
act
protested
against
the
cruel
prejudice
which
shut
out
its
victims
from
the
rights
and
privileges
of
american
citizens
her
philanthropy
had
no
taint
of
fanaticism
throughout
the
long
struggle
in
which
she
was
a
prominent
actor
she
kept
her
fine
sense
of
humor
good
taste
and
sensibility
to
the
beautiful
in
art
and
nature
the
opposition
she
met
with
from
those
who
had
shared
her
confidence
and
friendship
was
of
course
keenly
felt
but
her
kindly
and
genial
disposition
remained
unsoured
she
rarely
spoke
of
her
personal
trials
and
never
posed
as
a
martyr
the
nearest
approach
to
anything
like
complaint
is
in
the
following
lines
the
date
of
which
i
have
not
been
able
to
ascertain
the
world
that
i
am
passing
through
few
in
the
days
of
early
youth
trusted
like
me
in
love
and
truth
i
learned
sad
lessons
from
the
years
but
slowly
and
with
many
tears
for
god
made
me
to
kindly
view
the
world
that
i
am
passing
through
though
kindness
and
forbearance
long
must
meet
ingratitude
and
wrong
i
still
would
bless
my
and
trust
them
though
deceived
again
god
help
me
still
to
kindly
view
the
world
that
i
am
passing
through
from
all
that
fate
has
brought
to
me
i
strive
to
learn
humility
and
trust
in
him
who
rules
above
whose
universal
law
is
love
thus
only
can
i
kindly
view
the
world
that
i
am
passing
through
when
i
approach
the
setting
sun
and
feel
my
journey
done
may
earth
be
veiled
in
genial
light
and
her
last
smile
to
me
seem
bright
help
me
till
then
to
kindly
view
the
world
that
i
am
passing
through
and
all
who
tempt
a
trusting
heart
from
faith
and
hope
to
drift
apart
may
they
themselves
be
spared
the
pain
of
losing
power
to
trust
again
god
help
us
all
to
kindly
view
the
world
that
we
are
passing
through
while
faithful
to
the
great
duty
which
she
felt
was
laid
upon
her
in
an
especial
manner
she
was
by
no
means
a
reformer
of
one
idea
but
her
interest
was
manifested
in
every
question
affecting
the
welfare
of
humanity
peace
temperance
education
prison
reform
and
equality
of
civil
rights
irrespective
of
sex
engaged
her
attention
under
all
the
disadvantages
of
her
estrangement
from
popular
favor
her
charming
greek
romance
of
and
her
of
madame
and
the
de
proved
that
her
literary
ability
had
lost
nothing
of
its
strength
and
that
the
hand
which
penned
such
terrible
rebukes
had
still
kept
its
delicate
touch
and
gracefully
yielded
to
the
inspiration
of
fancy
and
art
while
engaged
with
her
husband
in
the
editorial
supervision
of
the
she
wrote
her
admirable
from
new
humorous
eloquent
and
picturesque
but
still
humanitarian
in
tone
which
extorted
the
praise
of
even
a
community
her
great
work
in
three
octavo
volumes
progress
of
religious
belongs
in
part
to
that
period
it
is
an
attempt
to
represent
in
a
candid
unprejudiced
manner
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
great
religions
of
the
world
and
their
ethical
relations
to
each
other
she
availed
herself
of
and
carefully
studied
the
authorities
at
that
time
accessible
and
the
result
is
creditable
to
her
scholarship
industry
and
conscientiousness
if
in
her
desire
to
do
justice
to
the
religions
of
buddha
and
mohammed
in
which
she
has
been
followed
by
maurice
max
muller
and
dean
stanley
she
seems
at
times
to
dwell
upon
the
best
and
overlook
the
darker
features
of
those
systems
her
concluding
reflections
should
vindicate
her
from
the
charge
of
undervaluing
the
christian
faith
or
of
lack
of
reverent
appreciation
of
its
founder
in
the
closing
chapter
of
her
work
in
which
the
large
charity
and
broad
sympathies
of
her
nature
are
manifest
she
thus
turns
with
words
of
love
warm
from
the
heart
to
him
whose
sermon
on
the
mount
includes
most
that
is
good
and
true
and
vital
in
the
religions
and
philosophies
of
the
world
it
was
reserved
for
him
to
heal
the
brokenhearted
to
preach
a
gospel
to
the
poor
to
say
sins
which
are
many
are
forgiven
for
she
loved
much
nearly
two
thousand
years
have
passed
away
since
these
words
of
love
and
pity
were
uttered
yet
when
i
read
them
my
eyes
fill
with
tears
i
thank
thee
o
heavenly
father
for
all
the
messengers
thou
hast
sent
to
man
but
above
all
i
thank
thee
for
him
thy
beloved
son

of
the
centuries
taking
root
in
the
lowliest
depths
and
receiving
the
light
and
warmth
of
heaven
in
its
golden
heart
all
that
the
pious
have
felt
all
that
poets
have
said
all
that
artists
have
done
with
their
manifold
forms
of
beauty
to
represent
the
ministry
of
jesus
are
but
feeble
expressions
of
the
great
debt
we
owe
him
who
is
even
now
curing
the
lame
restoring
sight
to
the
blind
and
raising
the
dead
in
that
spiritual
sense
wherein
all
miracle
is
true
during
her
stay
in
new
york
as
editor
of

she
found
a
pleasant
home
at
the
residence
of
the
genial
philanthropist
isaac
hopper

remarkable
life

her
portrayal
of
this
extraordinary
man
so
brave
so
humorous
so
tender
and
faithful
to
his
convictions
of
duty

one
of
the
most
readable
pieces
of
biography
in
english
literature
thomas
wentworth
higginson
in
a
discriminating
paper
published
in
speaks
of
her
eight
sojourn
in
new
york
as
the
most
interesting
and
satisfactory
period
of
her
whole
life
she
was
placed
where
her
sympathetic
nature
found
abundant
outlet
and
occupation
dwelling
in
a
house
where
disinterestedness
and
noble
labor
were
as
daily
breath
she
had
great
opportunities
there
was
no
mere
but
sin
and
sorrow
must
be
brought
home
to
the
fireside
and
the
heart
the
fugitive
slave
the
drunkard
the
outcast
woman
must
be
the
chosen
guests
of
the
abode
must
be
taken
and
held
and
loved
into
reformation
or
hope
it
would
be
a
very
imperfect
representation
of
maria
child
which
regarded
her
only
from
a
literary
point
of
view
she
was
wise
in
counsel
and
men
like
charles
sumner
henry
wilson
salmon
chase
and
governor
andrew
availed
themselves
of
her
foresight
and
sound
judgment
of
men
and
measures
her
pen
was
busy
with
correspondence
and
whenever
a
true
man
or
a
good
cause
needed
encouragement
she
was
prompt
to
give
it
her
donations
for
benevolent
causes
and
beneficent
reforms
were
constant
and
liberal
and
only
those
who
knew
her
intimately
could
understand
the
cheerful
and
unintermitted
which
alone
enabled
her
to
make
them
she
did
her
work
as
far
as
possible
out
of
sight
without
noise
or
pretension
her
time
talents
and
money
were
held
not
as
her
own
but
a
trust
from
the
eternal
father
for
the
benefit
of
his
suffering
children
her
plain
cheap
dress
was
glorified
by
the
generous
motive
for
which
she
wore
it
whether
in
the
crowded
city
among
the
and
starving
or
among
the
poor
and
afflicted
in
the
neighborhood
of
her
country
home
no
story
of
suffering
and
need
capable
of
alleviation
ever
reached
her
without
immediate
sympathy
and
corresponding
action
lowell

admirers

portrayed

to

no

against
many
deep
griefs
she
prevails
for
her
ear
is
the
refuge
of
destitute
tales
she
knows
well
that
silence
is
sorrow
best
food
and
that
talking
draws
off
from
the
heart
its
black
blood
the
pole
science
tells
us
the

controls
but
she
is
a
magnet
to
emigrant
poles
and
folks
with
a
mission
that
nobody

thickly
about
her

thou

drooping
feet
could
reach
firm
one

on
whose
beat
the

in

reposing
could
hear
the
chimes
of

childhood
throb
back
on
the
ear
ah
there
many
a
beam
from
the
fountain
of
day
that
to
reach
us
unclouded
must
pass
on
its
way
through
the
soul
of
a
woman
and
hers
is
wide
ope
to
the
influence
of
heaven
as
the
blue
eyes
of
hope
yes
a
great
heart
is
hers
one
that
dares
to
go
in
to
the
prison
the
the
alleys
of
sin
and
to
bring
into
each
or
to
find
there
some
line
of
the
never
completely
divine
if
her
heart
at
high
floods
swamps
her
brain
now
and
then
is
but
richer
for
that
when
the
tide
ebbs
again
as
after
old
nile
has
subsided
his
plain
overflows
with
a
second
broad
deluge
of
grain
what
a
wealth
would
it
bring
to
the
narrow
and
sour
could
they
be
as
a
child
but
for
one
little
hour
after
leaving
new
york
her
husband
and
herself
took
up
their
residence
in
the
rural
town
of
wayland
mass
their
house
plain
and
unpretentious
had
a
wide
and
pleasant
outlook
a
flower
garden
carefully
tended
by
her
own
hands
in
front
and
on
the
side
a
fruit
orchard
and
vegetable
garden
under
the
special
care
of
her
husband
the
house
was
always
neat
with
some
appearance
of
unostentatious
decoration
evincing
at
once
the
artistic
taste
of
the
hostess
and
the
conscientious
economy
which
forbade
its
indulgence
to
any
great
extent
her
home
was
somewhat
apart
from
the
lines
of
rapid
travel
and
her
hospitality
was
in
a
great
measure
confined
to
old
and
intimate
friends
while
her
visits
to
the
city
were
brief
and
infrequent
a
friend
of
hers
who
had
ample
opportunities
for
a
full
knowledge
of
her
says
the
domestic
happiness
of
and
child
seemed
to
me
perfect
their
sympathies
their
admiration
of
all
things
good
and
their
hearty
hatred
of
all
things
mean
and
evil
were
in
entire
unison
child
shared
his
enthusiasms
and
was
very
proud
of
her
their
affection
never
paraded
was
always
manifest
after
child
death
child
in
speaking
of
the
future
life
said
believe
it
would
be
of
small
value
to
me
if
i
were
not
united
to
him
in
this
connection
i
can
not
forbear
to
give
an
extract
from
some
reminiscences
of
her
husband
which
she
left
among
her
papers
which
better
than
any
words
of
mine
will
convey
an
idea
of
their
simple
and
beautiful
in
we
made
a
humble
home
in
wayland
where
we
spent
two
pleasant
years
entirely
alone
without
any
domestic
mutually
serving
each
other
and
dependent
upon
each
other
for
intellectual
companionship
i
always
depended
on
his
richly
stored
mind
which
was
able
and
ready
to
furnish
needed
information
on
any
subject
he
was
my
walking
dictionary
of
many
languages
my
universal
encyclopaedia
in
his
old
age
he
was
as
affectionate
and
devoted
as
when
the
lover
of
my
youth
nay
he
manifested
even
more
tenderness
he
was
often
singing
nothing
half
so
sweet
in
life
as
love
old
dream
very
often
when
he
passed
by
me
he
would
lay
his
hand
softly
on
my
head
and
murmur
but
what
i
remember
with
the
most
tender
gratitude
is
his
uniform
patience
and
forbearance
with
my
he
never
would
see
anything
but
the
bright
side
of
my
character
he
always
insisted
upon
thinking
that
whatever
i
said
was
the
wisest
and
the
wittiest
and
that
whatever
i
did
was
the
best
the
simplest
little
jeu
of
mine
seemed
to
him
wonderfully
witty
once
when
he
said
wish
for
your
sake
dear
i
were
as
rich
as
croesus
i
answered
are
croesus
for
you
are
king
of
lydia
how
often
he
used
to
quote
that
his
mind
was
unclouded
to
the
last
he
had
a
passion
for
philology
and
only
eight
hours
before
he
passed
away
he
was
searching
out
the
derivation
of
a
word
her
mind
and
fine
conversational
gifts
made
her
company
always
desirable
no
one
who
listened
to
her
can
forget
the
earnest
eloquence
with
which
she
used
to
dwell
upon
the
evidences
from
history
tradition
and
experience
of
the
superhuman
and
supernatural
or
with
what
eager
interest
she
detected
in
the
mysteries
of
the
old
religions
of
the
world
the
germs
of
a
purer
faith
and
a
holier
hope
she
loved
to
listen
as
in
pierre
symposium
of
of
to
the
confessions
of
faith
of
all
sects
and
schools
of
philosophy
christian
and
pagan
and
gather
from
them
the
consoling
truth
that
our
father
has
nowhere
left
his
children
without
some
witness
of
himself
she
loved
the
old
mystics
and
lingered
with
curious
interest
and
sympathy
over
the
writings
of
bohme
swedenborg
molinos
and
woolman
yet
this
marked
speculative
tendency
seemed
not
in
the
slightest
degree
to
affect
her
practical
activities
her
mysticism
and
realism
ran
in
close
parallel
lines
without
interfering
with
each
other
with
strong
rationalistic
tendencies
from
education
and
conviction
she
found
herself
in
spiritual
accord
with
the
pious
introversion
of
thomas
a
kempis
and
madame
guion
she
was
fond
of
christmas
eve
stories
of
warnings
signs
and
spiritual
intimations
her
half
belief
in
which
sometimes
seemed
like
credulity
to
her
auditors
james
russell
lowell
in
his
tender
tribute
to
her
playfully
alludes
to
this
characteristic
she
has
such
a
musical
taste
that
she
go
any
distance
to
hear
one
who
draws
a
long
bow
she
will
swallow
a
wonder
by
mere
might
and
main
in
the
descent
of
john
brown
upon
harper
ferry
and
his
capture
trial
and
death
startled
the
nation
when
the
news
reached
her
that
the
misguided
but
noble
old
man
lay
desperately
wounded
in
prison
alone
and
unfriended
she
wrote
him
a
letter
under
cover
of
one
to
governor
wise
asking
permission
to
go
and
nurse
and
care
for
him
the
expected
arrival
of
captain
brown
wife
made
her
generous
offer
unnecessary
the
prisoner
wrote
her
thanking
her
and
asking
her
to
help
his
family
a
request
with
which
she
faithfully
complied
with
his
letter
came
one
from
governor
wise
in
courteous
reproval
of
her
sympathy
for
john
brown
to
this
she
responded
in
an
able
and
effective
manner
her
reply
found
its
way
from
virginia
to
the
new
york
tribune
and
soon
after
mason
of
king
george
county
wife
of
senator
mason
the
author
of
the
infamous
fugitive
slave
law
wrote
her
a
vehement
letter
commencing
with
threats
of
future
damnation
and
ending
with
assuring
her
that
no
southerner
after
reading
her
letter
to
governor
wise
ought
to
read
a
line
of
her
composition
or
touch
a
magazine
which
bore
her
name
in
its
list
of
contributors
to
this
she
wrote
a
calm
dignified
reply
declining
to
dwell
on
the
fierce
invectives
of
her
assailant
and
wishing
her
well
here
and
hereafter
she
would
not
debate
the
specific
merits
or
demerits
of
a
man
whose
body
was
in
charge
of
the
courts
and
whose
reputation
was
sure
to
be
in
charge
of
posterity
men
she
continues
are
of
small
consequence
in
comparison
with
principles
and
the
principle
for
which
john
brown
died
is
the
question
at
issue
between
us
these
letters
were
soon
published
in
pamphlet
form
and
had
the
immense
circulation
of
copies
in
she
published
romance
of
the
a
story
of
the
days
of
slavery
powerful
in
its
delineation
of
some
of
the
saddest
as
well
as
the
most
dramatic
conditions
of
master
and
slave
in
the
southern
states
her
husband
who
had
been
long
an
invalid
died
in
after
his
death
her
home
in
winter
especially
became
a
lonely
one
and
in
she
began
to
spend
the
cold
months
in
boston
her
last
publication
was
in
when
her
of
the
a
book
of
selections
on
moral
and
religious
subjects
from
the
literature
of
all
nations
and
times
was
given
to
the
public
the
introduction
occupying
fifty
pages
shows
at
threescore
and
ten
her
mental
vigor
unabated
and
is
remarkable
for
its
wise
philosophic
tone
and
felicity
of
diction
it
has
the
broad
liberality
of
her
more
elaborate
work
on
the
same
subject
and
in
the
mellow
light
of
life
sunset
her
words
seem
touched
with
a
tender
pathos
and
beauty
all
we
poor
mortals
she
says
are
groping
our
way
through
paths
that
are
dim
with
shadows
and
we
are
all
striving
with
steps
more
or
less
stumbling
to
follow
some
guiding
star
as
we
travel
on
beloved
companions
of
our
pilgrimage
vanish
from
our
sight
we
know
not
whither
and
our
bereaved
hearts
utter
cries
of
supplication
for
more
light
we
know
not
where
hermes
trismegistus
lived
or
who
he
was
but
his
voice
sounds
plaintively
human
coming
up
from
the
depths
of
the
ages
calling
out
art
god
and
thy
man
crieth
these
things
unto
thee
thus
closely
allied
in
our
sorrows
and
limitations
in
our
aspirations
and
hopes
surely
we
ought
not
to
be
separated
in
our
sympathies
however
various
the
names
by
which
we
call
the
heavenly
father
if
they
are
set
to
music
by
brotherly
love
they
can
all
be
sung
together
her
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
emancipated
class
at
the
south
and
of
the
indians
of
the
west
remained
unabated
and
she
watched
with
great
satisfaction
the
experiment
of
the
education
of
both
classes
in
general
armstrong
institution
at
hampton
she
omitted
no
opportunity
of
aiding
the
greatest
social
reform
of
the
age
which
aims
to
make
the
civil
and
political
rights
of
women
equal
to
those
of
men
her
sympathies
to
the
last
went
out
instinctively
to
the
wronged
and
weak
she
used
to
excuse
her
vehemence
in
this
respect
by
laughingly
quoting
lines
from
a
poem
entitled
under
dog
in
the
i
know
that
the
world
the
great
big
world
will
never
a
moment
stop
to
see
which
dog
may
be
in
the
wrong
but
will
shout
for
the
dog
on
top
but
for
me
i
never
shall
pause
to
ask
which
dog
may
be
in
the
right
for
my
heart
will
beat
while
it
beats
at
all
for
the
under
dog
in
the
fight
i
am
indebted
to
a
gentleman
who
was
at
one
time
a
resident
of
wayland
and
who
enjoyed
her
confidence
and
warm
friendship
for
the
following
impressions
of
her
life
in
that
place
on
one
of
the
last
beautiful
indian
summer
afternoons
closing
the
past
year
i
drove
through
wayland
and
was
anew
impressed
with
the
charm
of
our
friend
simple
existence
there
the
tender
beauty
of
the
fading
year
seemed
a
reflection
of
her
own
gracious
spirit
the
lovely
autumn
of
her
life
whose
golden
atmosphere
the
frosts
of
sorrow
and
advancing
age
had
only
clarified
and
brightened
my
earliest
recollection
of
child
in
wayland
is
of
a
gentle
face
leaning
from
the
old
stage
window
smiling
kindly
down
on
the
childish
figures
beneath
her
and
from
that
moment
her
gracious
motherly
presence
has
been
closely
associated
with
the
charm
of
rural
beauty
in
that
village
which
until
very
lately
has
been
quite
apart
from
the
line
of
travel
and
unspoiled
by
the
rush
and
worry
of
our
modern
mode
of
living
child
life
in
the
place
made
indeed
an
atmosphere
of
its
own
a
benison
of
peace
and
which
was
a
noticeable
feature
to
all
who
were
acquainted
with
the
social
feeling
of
the
little
community
refined
as
it
was
too
by
the
elevating
influence
of
its
distinguished
pastor
sears
many
are
the
acts
of
loving
kindness
and
maternal
care
which
could
be
chronicled
of
her
residence
there
were
we
permitted
to
do
so
and
numberless
are
the
lives
that
have
gathered
their
onward
impulse
from
her
helping
hand
but
it
was
all
a
confidence
which
she
hardly
betrayed
to
her
inmost
self
and
i
will
not
recall
instances
which
might
be
her
grandest
eulogy
her
monument
is
builded
in
the
hearts
which
knew
her
benefactions
and
it
will
abide
with
power
that
makes
for
righteousness
one
of
the
pleasantest
elements
of
her
life
in
wayland
was
the
high
regard
she
won
from
the
people
of
the
village
who
proud
of
her
literary
attainment
valued
yet
more
the
noble
womanhood
of
the
friend
who
dwelt
so
modestly
among
them
the
grandeur
of
her
exalted
personal
character
had
in
part
eclipsed
for
them
the
qualities
which
made
her
fame
with
the
world
outside
the
little
house
on
the
quiet
overlooked
broad
green
meadows
the
pond
behind
it
where
bloom
the
lilies
whose
spotless
purity
may
well
symbolize
her
gentle
spirit
is
a
sacred
pool
to
her
townsfolk
but
perhaps
the
most
fitting
similitude
of
her
life
in
wayland
was
the
quiet
flow
of
the
river
whose
gentle
curves
make
green
her
meadows
but
whose
powerful
energy
joining
the
floods
from
distant
mountains
moves
with
resistless
might
the
busy
shuttles
of
a
hundred
mills
she
was
too
truthful
to
affect
to
welcome
unwarrantable
invaders
of
her
peace
but
no
weary
traveller
on
life
hard
ways
ever
applied
to
her
in
vain
the
little
garden
plot
before
her
door
was
a
sacred
enclosure
not
to
be
rudely
intruded
upon
but
the
flowers
she
tended
with
maternal
care
were
no
selfish
possession
for
her
own
enjoyment
only
and
many
are
the
lives
their
sweetness
has
gladdened
forever
so
she
lived
among
a
singularly
peaceful
and
intelligent
community
as
one
of
themselves
industrious
wise
and
happy
with
a
frugality
whose
motive
of
wider
benevolence
was
in
itself
a
homily
and
a
benediction
in
my
last
interview
with
her
our
conversation
as
had
often
happened
before
turned
upon
the
great
theme
of
the
future
life
she
spoke
as
i
remember
calmly
and
not
uncheerfully
but
with
the
intense
earnestness
and
reverent
curiosity
of
one
who
felt
already
the
shadow
of
the
unseen
world
resting
upon
her
her
death
was
sudden
and
quite
unexpected
for
some
months
she
had
been
troubled
with
a
rheumatic
affection
but
it
was
by
no
means
regarded
as
serious
a
friend
who
visited
her
a
few
days
before
her
departure
found
her
in
a
comfortable
condition
apart
from
lameness
she
talked
of
the
coming
election
with
much
interest
and
of
her
plans
for
the
winter
on
the
morning
of
her
death
october
she
spoke
of
feeling
remarkably
well
before
leaving
her
chamber
she
complained
of
severe
pain
in
the
region
of
the
heart
help
was
called
by
her
companion
but
only
reached
her
to
witness
her
quiet
passing
away
the
funeral
was
as
befitted
one
like
her
plain
and
simple
many
of
her
old
friends
were
present
and
wendell
phillips
paid
an
affecting
and
eloquent
tribute
to
his
old
friend
and
coadjutor
he
referred
to
the
time
when
she
accepted
with
serene
the
obloquy
which
her
had
brought
upon
her
and
noted
as
one
of
the
many
ways
in
which
popular
hatred
was
manifested
the
withdrawal
from
her
of
the
privileges
of
the
boston
athenaeum
her
pallbearers
were
elderly
plain
farmers
in
the
neighborhood
and
led
by
the
old
undertaker
the
procession
wound
its
way
to
the
not
distant
ground
over
the
red
and
gold
of
fallen
leaves
and
tinder
the
clouded
october
sky
a
lover
of
all
beautiful
things
she
was
as
her
intimate
friends
knew
always
delighted
by
the
sight
of
rainbows
and
used
to
so
arrange
prismatic
glasses
as
to
throw
the
colors
on
the
walls
of
her
room
just
after
her
body
was
consigned
to
the
earth
a
magnificent
rainbow
spanned
with
its
are
of
glory
the
eastern
sky
the
incident
at
her
burial
is
alluded
to
in
a
sonnet
written
by
william
andrews
freedom
she
knew
thy
summons
and
obeyed
that
clarion
voice
as
yet
scarce
heard
of
men
gladly
she
joined
thy
service
when
honor
and
wealth
must
at
thy
feet
be
laid
onward
with
faith
undaunted
undismayed
by
threat
or
scorn
she
toiled
with
hand
and
brain
to
make
thy
cause
triumphant
till
the
chain
lay
broken
and
for
her
the
freedmen
prayed
nor
yet
she
faltered
in
her
tender
care
she
took
us
all
and
she
went
blessings
and
faith
and
beauty
followed
there
to
the
end
where
she
lay
down
content
and
with
the
gold
light
of
a
life
more
fair
twin
bows
of
promise
her
grave
were
blest
the
letters
in
this
collection
constitute
but
a
small
part
of
her
large
correspondence
they
have
been
gathered
up
and
arranged
by
the
hands
of
dear
relatives
and
friends
as
a
fitting
memorial
of
one
who
wrote
from
the
heart
as
well
as
the
head
and
who
held
her
literary
reputation
subordinate
always
to
her
philanthropic
aim
to
lessen
the
sum
of
human
suffering
and
to
make
the
world
better
for
her
living
if
they
sometimes
show
the
heat
and
impatience
of
a
zealous
reformer
they
may
well
be
pardoned
in
consideration
of
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
written
and
of
the
natural
indignation
of
a
generous
nature
in
view
of
wrong
and
oppression
if
she
touched
with
no
very
reverent
hand
the
garment
hem
of
dogmas
and
held
to
the
spirit
of
scripture
rather
than
its
letter
it
must
be
remembered
that
she
lived
in
a
time
when
the
bible
was
cited
in
defence
of
slavery
as
it
is
now
in
utah
in
support
of
polygamy
and
she
may
well
be
excused
for
some
degree
of
impatience
with
those
who
in
the
tithing
of
mint
and
anise
and
cummin
neglected
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
of
justice
and
mercy
of
the
men
and
women
directly
associated
with
the
beloved
subject
of
this
sketch
but
few
are
now
left
to
recall
her
devotion
to
apprehended
duty
her
unselfish
generosity
her
love
of
all
beauty
and
harmony
and
her
trustful
reverence
free
from
pretence
and
cant
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
surviving
sharers
of
her
love
and
friendship
may
feel
the
inadequateness
of
this
brief
memorial
for
i
close
it
with
the
consciousness
of
having
failed
to
fully
delineate
the
picture
which
my
memory
holds
of
a
wise
and
brave
but
tender
and
loving
woman
of
whom
it
might
well
have
been
said
in
the
words
of
the
old
hebrew
text
many
daughters
have
done
virtuously
but
thou
excellest
them

on
the
occasion
of
the
birthday
of
holmes
critic
of
new
collected
personal
tributes
from
friends
and
admirers
of
that
author
my
own
contribution
was
as
follows
poet
essayist
novelist
humorist
scientist
ripe
scholar
and
wise
philosopher
if
holmes
does
not
at
the
present
time
hold
in
popular
estimation
the
first
place
in
american
literature
his
rare
versatility
is
the
cause
in
view
of
the
inimitable
prose
writer
we
forget
the
poet
in
our
admiration
of
his
melodious
verse
we
lose
sight
of
and
autocrat
of
the
breakfast
we
laugh
over
his
wit
and
humor
until
to
use
his
own
words
we
suspect
the
azure
blossom
that
unfolds
upon
a
shoot
as
if
wisdom
old
potato
could
not
flourish
at
its
root
and
perhaps
the
next
page
melts
us
into
tears
by
a
pathos
only
equalled
by
that
of
sterne
sick
lieutenant
he
is
montaigne
and
bacon
under
one
hat
his
varied
qualities
would
suffice
for
the
mental
furnishing
of
half
a
dozen
literary
specialists
to
those
who
have
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
his
intimate
acquaintance
the
man
himself
is
more
than
the
author
his
genial
nature
entire
freedom
from
jealousy
or
envy
quick
tenderness
large
charity
hatred
of
sham
pretence
and
unreality
and
his
reverent
sense
of
the
eternal
and
permanent
have
secured
for
him
something
more
and
dearer
than
literary
renown
the
love
of
all
who
know
him
i
might
say
much
more
i
could
not
say
less

sorry
that
i
can
not
hope
to
be
with
you
on
the
anniversary
of
the
settlement
of
old
newbury
although
i
can
hardly
call
myself
a
son
of
the
ancient
town
my
grandmother
sarah
greenleaf
of
blessed
memory
was
its
daughter
and
i
may
therefore
claim
to
be
its
grandson
its
genial
and
learned
historian
joshua
coffin
was
my
first
and
all
my
life
i
have
lived
in
sight
of
its
green
hills
and
in
hearing
of
its
sabbath
bells
its
wealth
of
natural
beauty
has
not
been
left
unsung
by
its
own
poets
hannah
gould
hopkins
george
lunt
and
edward
washburn
while
harriet
prescott
spofford
plum
island
sound
is
as
sweet
and
musical
as
tennyson
brook
its
history
and
legends
are
familiar
to
me
i
seem
to
have
known
all
its
old
worthies
whose
descendants
have
helped
to
people
a
continent
and
who
have
carried
the
name
and
memories
of
their
birthplace
to
the
mexican
gulf
and
across
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
shores
of
the
pacific
they
were
the
best
and
selectest
of
puritanism
brave
honest
men
and
women
and
if
their
creed
in
the
lapse
of
time
has
lost
something
of
its
vigor
the
influence
of
their
ethical
righteousness
still
endures
the
prophecy
of
samuel
sewall
that
christians
should
be
found
in
newbury
so
long
as
pigeons
shall
roost
on
its
oaks
and
indian
corn
grows
in
oldtown
fields
remains
still
true
and
we
trust
will
always
remain
so
yet
as
of
old
the
evil
personage
sometimes
intrudes
himself
into
company
too
good
for
him
it
was
said
in
the
witchcraft
trials
of
that
satan
baptized
his
converts
at
newbury
falls
the
scene
probably
of
one
of
hawthorne
weird
told
and
there
is
a
tradition
that
in
the
midst
of
a
heated
controversy
between
one
of
painful
ministers
and
his
deacon
who
anticipating
garrison
by
a
century
ventured
to
doubt
the
propriety
of
clerical
slaveholding
the
adversary
made
his
appearance
in
the
shape
of
a
black
giant
stalking
through
byfield
it
was
never
i
believe
definitely
settled
whether
he
was
drawn
there
by
the
minister
zeal
in
defence
of
slavery
or
the
deacon
irreverent
denial
of
the
minister
right
and
duty
to
curse
canaan
in
the
person
of
his
negro
old
newbury
has
sometimes
been
spoken
of
as
and
hostile
to
new
ideas
and
progress
but
this
is
not
warranted
by
its
history
more
than
two
centuries
ago
when
major
pike
just
across
the
river
stood
up
and
denounced
in
open
town
meeting
the
law
against
freedom
of
conscience
and
worship
and
was
in
consequence
fined
and
outlawed
some
of
newbury
best
citizens
stood
bravely
by
him
the
town
took
no
part
in
the
witchcraft
horror
and
got
none
of
its
old
women
and
town
charges
hanged
for
witches
goody
morse

the
spirit
rappings
in
her
house
two
hundred
years
earlier
than
the
fox

did
and
somewhat
later
a
newbury
minister
in
wig
and
rode
bible
in
hand
over
to
hampton
to
lay
a
ghost
who
had
materialized
himself
and
was
stamping
up
and
down

his
military

whipped
at

on

hand
and
at

on
the

they
could
make
no

since
followed
by
the

in

town
must
be
regarded
as
the
alpha
and
omega
of
agitation
beginning
with
its
abolition
deacon
and
ending
with
garrison
puritanism
here
as
elsewhere
had
a
flavor
of
radicalism
it
had
its
humorous
side
and
its
ministers
did
not
hesitate
to
use
wit
and
sarcasm
like
elijah

the

of

for

the

and

has
just
laid
down

nearly
one
hundred
years
startled
and
shamed
his
brother

who
were
zealously
for
the
enforcement
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
by
preparing
for
them
a
form
of
prayer
for
use
while
engaged
in
catching
runaway

i
have
i
fear
dwelt
too
long
upon
the
story
and
tradition
of
the
old
town
which
will
doubtless
be
better
told
by
the
orator
of
the
day
the
theme
is
to
me
full
of
interest
among
the
blessings
which
i
would
gratefully
own
is
the
fact
that
my
lot
has
been
cast
in
the
beautiful

dear
friends
i
was
most
agreeably
surprised
last
evening
by
receiving
your
carefully
prepared
and
beautiful
haverhill
academy
album
containing
the
photographs
of
a
large
number
of
my
old
friends
and
schoolmates
i
know
of
nothing
which
could
have
given
me
more
pleasure
if
the
faces
represented
are
not
so
unlined
and
ruddy
as
those
which
greeted
each
other
at
the
old
academy
on
the
pleasant
summer
mornings
so
long
ago
when
life
was
before
us
with
its
boundless
horizon
of
possibilities
yet
as
i
look
over
them
i
see
that
on
the
whole
time
has
not
been
hard
with
us
but
has
touched
us
gently
the
hieroglyphics
he
has
traced
upon
us
may
indeed
reveal
something
of
the
cares
trials
and
sorrows
incident
to
humanity
but
they
also
tell
of
generous
endeavor
beneficent
labor
developed
character
and
the
slow
sure
victories
of
patience
and
fortitude
i
turn
to
them
with
the
proud
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
i
have
been
highly
favored
in
my
early
companions
and
that
i
have
not
been
disappointed
in
my
school
friendships
the
two
years
spent
at
the
academy
i
have
always
reckoned
among
the
happiest
of
my
life
though
i
have
abundant
reason
for
gratitude
that
in
the
long
intervening
years
i
have
been
blessed
beyond
my
deserving
it
has
been
our
privilege
to
live
in
an
eventful
period
and
to
witness
wonderful
changes
since
we
conned
our
lessons
together
how
little
we
then
dreamed
of
the
steam
car
electric
telegraph
and
telephone
we
studied
the
history
and
geography
of
a
world
only
half
explored
our
country
was
an
unsolved
mystery
the
great
american
desert
was
an
awful
blank
on
our
school
maps
we
have
since
passed
through
the
terrible
ordeal
of
civil
war
which
has
liberated
enslaved
millions
and
made
the
union
of
the
states
an
established
fact
and
no
longer
a
doubtful
theory
if
life
is
to
be
measured
not
so
much
by
years
as
by
thoughts
emotion
knowledge
action
and
its
opportunity
of
a
free
exercise
of
all
our
powers
and
faculties
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
upon
really
outliving
the
venerable
patriarchs
for
myself
i
would
not
exchange
a
decade
of
my

friend
of

edwin
whipple
death
however
expected
is
always
something
of
a
surprise
and
in
his
case
i
was
not
prepared
for
it
by
knowing
of
any
serious
failure
of
his
health
with
the
possible
exception
of
lowell
and
matthew
arnold
he
was
the
ablest
critical
essayist
of
his
time
and
the
place
he
has
left
will
not
be
readily
filled
scarcely
inferior
to
macaulay
in
brilliance
of
diction
and
graphic
portraiture
he
was
freer
from
prejudice
and
passion
and
more
loyal
to
the
truth
of
fact
and
history
he
was
a
thoroughly
honest
man
he
wrote
with
conscience
always
at
his
elbow
and
never
sacrificed
his
real
convictions
for
the
sake
of
epigram
and
antithesis
he
instinctively
took
the
right
side
of
the
questions
that
came
before
him
for
decision
even
when
by
so
doing
he
ranked
himself
with
the
unpopular
minority
he
had
the
manliest
hatred
of
hypocrisy
and
meanness
but
if
his
language
had
at
times
the
severity
of
justice
it
was
never
merciless
he
set
down
naught
in
malice
never
blind
to
faults
he
had
a
quick
and
sympathetic
eye
for
any
real
excellence
or
evidence
of
reserved
strength
in
the
author
under
discussion
he
was
a
modest
man
sinking
his
own
personality
out
of
sight
and
he
always
seemed
to
me
more
interested
in
the
success
of
others
than
in
his
own
many
of
his
literary
contemporaries
have
had
reason
to
thank
him
not
only
for
his
cordial
recognition
and
generous
praise
but
for
the
firm
and
yet
kindly
hand
which
pointed
out
deficiencies
and
errors
of
taste
and
judgment
as
one
of
those
who
have
found
pleasure
and
profit
in
his
writings
in
the
past
i
would
gratefully
commend
them
to
the
generation
which
survives
him
his
of
the
age
of
is
deservedly
popular
but
there
are
none
of
his
essays
which
will
not
repay
a
careful
study
what
works
of
baxter
shall
i
read
asked
boswell
of
johnson
read
any
of
them
was
the
answer
for
they
are
all
good
he
will
have
an
honored
place
in
the
history
of
american
literature
but
i
can
not
now
dwell
upon
his
authorship
while
thinking
of
him
as
the
beloved
member
of
a
literary
circle
now
alas
sadly
broken
i
recall
the
wise
genial
companion
and
faithful
friend
of
nearly
half
a
century
the
memory
of
whose
words
and
acts
of
kindness
moistens
my
eyes
as
i
write
it
is
the
inevitable
sorrow
of
age
that
one
companions
must
drop
away
on
the
right
hand
and
the
left
with
increasing
frequency
until
we
are
compelled
to
ask
with
wordsworth
who
next
shall
fall
and
disappear
but
in
the
case
of
him
who
has
just
passed
from
us
we
have
the
satisfaction
of

which
was
intended
to
smooth
away
the
difficulties
which
his
moderate
opposition
to
the
encroachments
of

had
erected
in
his
path
to
the

his
calumniation
of
called
out
the

summary
of
the
career
of
the
great
irish
patriot
it
was
published
originally
in
the
pennsylvania
freeman
of
philadelphia
april
perhaps
the
most
unlucky
portion
of
the
unlucky
speech
of
henry
clay
on
the
slavery
question
is
that
in
which
an
attempt
is
made
to
hold
up
to
scorn
and
contempt
the
great
liberator
of
ireland
we
say
an
attempt
for
who
will
say
it
has
succeeded
who
feels
contempt
for
surely
not
the
slaveholder
from
henry
clay
surrounded
by
his
gang
at
ashland
to
the
most
miserable
and
squalid
and
small
breeder
of
human
cattle
in
virginia
and
maryland
who
can
spell
the
name
of
in
his
newspaper
these
republican
brokers
in
blood
fear
and
hate
the
eloquent
irishman
but
their
contempt
forsooth
talk
of
the
contempt
for
the
officer
of
justice
who
nails
his
ears
to
the
pillory
or
sets
the
branding
iron
on
his
forehead
after
denouncing
the
abolitionists
for
gratuitously
republishing
the
advertisements
for
runaway
slaves
the
kentucky
orator
says
and
like
a
notorious
agitator
upon
another
theatre
they
would
hunt
down
and
proscribe
from
the
pale
of
civilized
society
the
inhabitants
of
that
entire
section
allow
me
president
to
say
that
whilst
i
recognize
in
the
justly
wounded
feelings
of
the
minister
of
the
united
states
at
the
court
of
james
much
to
excuse
the
notice
which
he
was
provoked
to
take
of
that
agitator
in
my
humble
opinion
he
would
better
have
consulted
the
dignity
of
his
station
and
of
his
country
in
treating
him
with
contemptuous
silence
he
would
exclude
us
from
european
society
he
who
himself
can
only
obtain
a
contraband
admission
and
is
received
with
scornful
repugnance
into
it
if
he
be
no
more
desirous
of
our
society
than
we
are
of
his
he
may
rest
assured
that
a
state
of
perpetual
intercourse
will
exist
between
us
yes
sir
i
think
the
american
minister
would
best
have
pursued
the
dictates
of
true
dignity
by
regarding
the
language
of
the
member
of
the
british
house
of
commons
as
the
malignant
ravings
of
the
plunderer
of
his
own
country
and
the
libeller
of
a
foreign
and
kindred
people
the
recoil
of
this
attack
followed
hard
upon
the
tones
of
congratulation
and
triumph
of
partisan
editors
at
the
consummate
skill
and
dexterity
with
which
their
candidate
for
the
presidency
had
absolved
himself
from
the
suspicion
of
abolitionism
and
by
a
of
policy
secured
the
confidence
of
the
slaveholding
section
of
the
union
but
the
late
whig
defeat
in
new
york
has
put
an
end
to
these
premature
rejoicings
the
speech
of
clay
in
reference
to
the
irish
agitator
has
been
made
use
of
against
us
with
no
small
success
say
the
new
york
papers
they
failed
says
the
daily
evening
star
to
convince
the
irish
voters
that
daniel
was
the
of
his
country
or
that
there
was
an
excuse
for
thus
denouncing
him
the
defeat
of
the
whigs
of
new
york
and
the
cause
of
it
have
excited
no
small
degree
of
alarm
among
the
adherents
of
the
kentucky
orator
in
this
city
the
delicate
comes
magnanimously
to
the
aid
of
henry
clay
a
twittering
on
an
eagle
back
the
learned
editor
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
daniel
is
a
political
beggar
a
disorganizing
apostate
talks
in
its
pretty
way
of
the
man
impudence
and
falsehoods
and
cowardice
etc
and
finally
with
a
modesty
and
gravity
which
we
can
not
but
admire
assures
us
that
his
weakness
of
mind
is
almost
beyond
calculation
we
have
heard
it
rumored
during
the
past
week
among
some
of
the
constituted
organs
of
the
clay
party
in
this
city
that
at
a
late
meeting
in
chestnut
street
a
committee
was
appointed
to
collect
collate
and
publish
the
correspondence
between
andrew
stevenson
and
and
so
much
of
the
latter
speeches
and
writings
as
relate
to
american
slavery
for
the
purpose
of
convincing
the
countrymen
of
of
the
justice
propriety
and
in
view
of
the
aggravated
circumstances
of
the
case
moderation
and
forbearance
of
henry
clay
when
speaking
of
a
man
who
has
had
the
impudence
to
intermeddle
with
the
patriarchal
institutions
of
our
country
and
with
the
domestic
relations
of
kentucky
and
virginia
we
wait
impatiently
for
the
fruits
of
the
labors
of
this
sagacious
committee
we
should
like
to
see
those
eloquent
and
thrilling
appeals
to
the
sense
of
shame
and
justice
and
honor
of
america
republished
we
should
like
to
see
if
any
irishman
not
wholly
recreant
to
the
interests
and
welfare
of
the
green
island
of
his
birth
will
in
consequence
of
this
publication
give
his
vote
to
the
slanderer
of
ireland
best
and
noblest
champion
but
who
is
daniel
a
demagogue
a
ruffian
agitator
say
the
tory
journals
of
great
britain
quaking
meantime
with
awe
and
apprehension
before
the
tremendous
moral
and
political
power
which
he
is
wielding
a
power
at
this
instant
mightier
than
that
of

no

a

unstained
with

and
unmoistened
by

and
his
mighty
instrumentality
in

abolition
of

colonial
slavery
have
left
their
impress
upon
the

they
will
be
remembered
and

after

abroad
detected
in
their
guilt

writhing
in

shall
have
perished
forever
when
the
clays

the

the
opponents
of
reform
in

britain
and
the
enemies
of

states
shall
be
numbered
with
those
who
in
all
ages
to
use
the
words
of
the
eloquent
lamartine
have
sinned
against
the
holy
ghost
in
opposing
the
improvement
of
things
in
an
egotistical
and
stupid
attempt
to
draw
back
the
moral
and
social
world
which
god
and
nature
are
urging
forward
the
character
and
services
of
have
never
been
fully
appreciated
in
this
country
engrossed
in
our
own
peculiar
interests
and
in
the
plenitude
of
our
believing
that
we
are
the
people
and
that
wisdom
will
perish
with
us
that
all
patriotism
and
liberality
of
feeling
are
confined
to
our
own
territory
we
have
not
followed
the
untitled
barrister
of
derrynane
abbey
step
by
step
through
the
development
of
one
of
the
noblest
experiments
ever
made
for
the
cause
of
liberty
and
the
welfare
of
man
the
revolution
which
has
already
partially
effected
in
his
native
land
and
which
from
the
evident
signs
of
cooperation
in
england
and
scotland
seems
not
far
from
its
entire
accomplishment
will
form
a
new
era
in
the
history
of
the
civilized
world
heretofore
the
patriot
has
relied
more
upon
physical
than
moral
means
for
the
regeneration
of
his
country
and
its
redemption
from
oppression
his
revolutions
however
pure
in
principle
have
ended
in
practical
crime
the
great
truth
was
yet
to
be
learned
that
brute
force
is
incompatible
with
a
pure
love
of
freedom
inasmuch
as
it
is
in
itself
an
odious
species
of
tyranny
the
relic
of
an
age
of
slavery
and
barbarism
the
common
argument
of
despotism
a
game
which
were
their
subjects
wise
kings
would
not
play
at
but
the
revolution
in
which
is
engaged
although
directed
against
the
oppression
of
centuries
relies
with
just
confidence
upon
the
united
moral
energies
of
the
people
a
moral
victory
of
reason
over
prejudice
of
justice
over
oppression
the
triumph
of
intellectual
energy
where
the
brute
appeal
to
arms
had
miserably
failed
the
vindication
of
man
eternal
rights
not
by
the
sword
fleshed
in
human
hearts
but
by
weapons
tempered
in
the
armory
of
heaven
with
truth
and
mercy
and
love
nor
is
it
a
visionary
idea
or
the
untried
theory
of
an
enthusiast
this
triumphant
reliance
upon
moral
and
intellectual
power
for
the
reform
of
political
abuses
for
the
overthrowing
of
tyranny
and
the
pulling
down
of
the
strongholds
of
arbitrary
power
the
emancipation
of
the
catholic
of
great
britain
from
the
thrall
of
a
century
in
prepared
the
way
for
the
bloodless
triumph
of
english
reform
in
the
catholic
association
was
the
germ
of
those
political
unions
which
compelled
by
their
mighty
yet
peaceful
influence
the
king
of
england
to
yield
submissively
to
the
supremacy
of
the
people
the
celebrated
attwood
has
been
called
the
father
of
political
unions
in
a
speech
delivered
by
his
brother
attwood
at
the
sunderland
reform
meeting
september
i
find
the
following
admission
gentlemen
the
first
political
union
was
the
roman
catholic
association
of
ireland
and
the
true
founder
and
father
of
political
unions
is
daniel
both
of
these
remarkable
events
these
revolutions
shaking
nations
to
their
centre
yet
polluted
with
no
blood
and
sullied
by
no
crime
were
effected
by
the
salutary
agitations
of
the
public
mind
first
set
in
motion
by
the
masterspirit
of
and
spreading
from
around
him
to
every
portion
of
the
british
empire
like
the
undulations
from
the
disturbed
centre
of
a
lake
the
catholic
question
has
been
but
imperfectly
understood
in
this
country
many
have
allowed
their
just
disapprobation
of
the
catholic
religion
to
degenerate
into
a
most
unwarrantable
prejudice
against
its
conscientious
followers
the
cruel
persecutions
of
the
dissenters
from
the
romish
church
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
day
the
horrors
of
the
inquisition
the
crusades
against
the
albigenses
and
the
simple
dwellers
of
the
vaudois
valleys
have
been
regarded
as
atrocities
peculiar
to
the
believers
in
papal
infallibility
and
the
necessary
consequences
of
their
doctrines
and
hence
they
have
looked
upon
the
constitutional
agitation
of
the
irish
catholics
for
relief
from
grieveous
disabilities
and
unjust
distinctions
as
a
struggle
merely
for
supremacy
or
power
strange
that
the
truth
to
which
all
history
so
strongly
testifies
should
thus
be
overlooked
the
undeniable
truth
that
religious
bigotry
and
intolerance
have
been
confined
to
no
single
sect
that
the
persecuted
of
one
century
have
been
the
persecutors
of
another
in
our
own
country
it
would
be
well
for
us
to
remember
that
at
the
very
time
when
in
new
england
the
catholic
the
quaker
and
the
baptist
were
banished
on
pain
of
death
and
where
some
even
suffered
that
dreadful
penalty
in
catholic
maryland
under
the
catholic
lord
baltimore
perfect
liberty
of
conscience
was
established
and
papist
and
protestant
went
quietly
through
the
same
streets
to
their
respective
altars
at
the
commencement
of
labors
for
emancipation
he
found
the
people
of
ireland
divided
into
three
great
classes
the
protestant
or
church
party
the
dissenters
and
the
catholics
the
church
party
constituting
about
one
tenth
of
the
population
yet
holding
in
possession
the
government
and
a
great
proportion
of
the
landed
property
of
ireland
controlling
church
and
state
and
law
and
revenue
the
army
navy
magistracy
and
corporations
the
entire
patronage
of
the
country
holding
their
property
and
power
by
the
favor
of
england
and
consequently
wholly
devoted
to
her
interest
the
dissenters
probably
twice
as
numerous
as
the
church
party
mostly
engaged
in
trade
and
manufactures
sustained
by
their
own
talents
and
industry
irish
in
feeling
partaking
in
no
small
degree
of
the
oppression
of
their
catholic
brethren
and
among
the
first
to
resist
that
oppression
in
the
catholics
constituting
at
least
two
thirds
of
the
whole
population
and
almost
the
entire
peasantry
of
the
country
forming
a
large
proportion
of
the
mercantile
interest
yet
nearly
excluded
from
the
possession
of
landed
property
by
the
tyrannous
operation
of
the
penal
laws
justly
has
a
celebrated
irish
patriot
theobald
wolfe
tone
spoken
of
these
laws
as
an
execrable
and
infamous
code
framed
with
the
art
and
malice
of
demons
to
plunder
and
degrade
and
brutalize
the
catholics
of
ireland
there
was
no
disgrace
no
injustice
no
disqualification
moral
political
or
religious
civil
or
military
which
it
has
not
heaped
upon
them
the
following
facts
relative
to
the
disabilities
under
which
the
catholics
of
the
united
kingdom
labored
previous
to
the
emancipation
of
will
serve
to
show
in
some
measure
the
oppressive
operation
of
those
laws
which
placed
the
foot
of
one
tenth
of
the
population
of
ireland
upon
the
necks
of

in

he
was
excluded
from

commenced
his
labors
for

with
the
strong
conviction
that
nothing
short
of
the
united
exertions
of
the
irish
people
could
overthrow
the
power
of

that

discarding

means
for

purpose
he
placed
himself
and
his
followers
beyond
the
cognizance

and
oppressive
laws
wherever
he
poured
the
oil
of
his
eloquence
upon
the
maddened
spirits
of
his
wronged
and
insulted
countrymen
the
mercenary
soldiery
found
no
longer
an
excuse
for
violence
and
calm
firm
and
united
the
catholic
association
remained
secure
in
the
moral
strength
of
its
pure
and
peaceful
purpose
amid
the
bayonets
of
a
tory
administration
his
influence
was
felt
in
all
parts
of
the
island
wherever
an
unlawful
association
existed
his
great
legal
knowledge
enabled
him
at
once
to
detect
its
character
and
by
urging
its
dissolution
to
snatch
its
deluded
members
from
the
ready
fangs
of
their
enemies
in
his
presence
the
catholic
and
the
protestant
shook
hands
together
and
the
wild
irish
clansman
forgot
his
feuds
he
taught
the
party
in
power
and
who
trembled
at
the
dangers
around
them
that
security
and
peace
could
only
be
obtained
by
justice
and
kindness
he
entreated
his
oppressed
catholic
brethren
to
lay
aside
their
weapons
and
with
pure
hearts
and
naked
hands
to
stand
firmly
together
in
the
calm
but
determined
energy
of
men
too
humane
for
deeds
of
violence
yet
too
mighty
for
the
patient
endurance
of

the
spirit
of
the
olden
time
was
awakened
of
the
day
when
flood
thundered
and

lightened
the
light
which
shone
for
a
moment
in
the
darkness
of
ireland
century
of
wrong
burned
upwards
clearly
and
steadily
from
all
its
ancient
altars
shoulder
to
shoulder
gathered
around
him
the
patriot
spirits
of
his
nation
men
unbribed
by
the
golden
spoils
of
governmental
patronage
shiel
with
his
ardent
eloquence
and
walsh
and
grattan
and
and
steel
the
protestant
agitator
wearing
around
him
the
emblem
of
national
reconciliation
of
the
reunion
of
catholic
and
protestant
the
sash
of
blended
orange
and
green
soiled
and
defaced
by
his
patriotic
errands
stained
with
the
smoke
of

and
the
night
rains
and
rust
of
weapons
and
the
mountain
mist
and
the
droppings
of
the
wild
woods
of
clare
he
united
in
one
mighty
and
resistless
mass
the
broken
and
discordant
factions
whose
desultory
struggles
against
tyranny
had
hitherto
only
added
strength
to
its
fetters
and
infused
into
that
mass
his
own
lofty
principles
of
action
until
the
solemn
tones
of
expostulation
and
entreaty
bursting
at
once
from
the
full
heart
of
ireland
were
caught
up
by
england
and
echoed
back
from
scotland
and
the
language
of
justice
and
humanity
was
wrung
from
the
reluctant
lips
of
the
cold
and
remorseless
oppressor
of
his
native
land
at
once
its
disgrace
and
glory
the
conqueror
of
napoleon
and
in
the
words
of
his
own
curran
the
chains
of
the
catholic
fell
from
around
him
and
he
stood
forth
redeemed
and
disenthralled
by
the
irresistible
genius
of
universal
emancipation
on
the
passage
of
the
bill
for
catholic
emancipation
took
his
seat
in
the
british
parliament
the
eyes
of
millions
were
upon
him
ireland
betrayed
so
often
by
those
in
whom
she
had
placed
her
confidence
brooding
in
sorrowful
remembrance
over
the
noble
names
and
brilliant
reputations
sullied
by
treachery
and
corruption
the
long
and
dark
catalogue
of
her
recreant
sons
who
allured
by
british
gold
and
british
patronage
had
sacrificed
on
the
altar
of
their
ambition
irish
pride
and
irish
independence
and
lifted
their
parricidal
arms
against
their
sorrowing
mother
crownless
and
voiceless
in
her
woe
now
hung
with
breathless
eagerness
over
the
ordeal
to
which
her
last
great
champion
was
subjected
the
crisis
in
destiny
had
come
the
glitter
of
the
golden
bribe
was
in
his
eye
the
sound
of
titled
magnificence
was
in
his
ear
the
choice
was
before
him
to
sit
high
among
the
honorable
the
titled
and
the
powerful
or
to
take
his
humble
seat
in
the
hall
of
stephen
as
the
irish
demagogue
the
agitator
the
kerry
representative
he
did
not
hesitate
in
his
choice
on
the
first
occasion
that
offered
he
told
the
story
of
ireland
wrongs
and
demanded
justice
in
the
name
of
his
suffering
constituents
he
had
put
his
hand
to
the
plough
of
reform
and
he
could
not
relinquish
his
hold
for
his
heart
was
with
it
determined
to
give
the
whig
administration
no
excuse
for
neglecting
the
redress
of
irish
grievances
he
entered
heart
and
soul
into
the
great
measure
of
english
reform
and
his
zeal
tact
and
eloquence
contributed
not
a
little
to
its
success
yet
even
his
friends
speak
of
his
first
efforts
in
the
house
of
commons
as
failures
the
irish
accent
the
harsh
avowal
of
purposes
smacking
of
rebellion
the
eccentricities
and
flowery
luxuriance
of
an
eloquence
nursed
in
the
fervid
atmosphere
of
ireland
suddenly
transplanted
to
the
cold
and
commonplace
one
of
stephen
the
great
and
illiberal
prejudices
against
him
scarcely
abated
from
what
they
were
when
as
the
member
from
clare
he
was
mobbed
on
his
way
to
london
for
a
time
opposed
a
barrier
to
the
influence
of
his
talents
and
patriotism
but
he
triumphed
at
last
the
of
clare
and
kerry
the
declaimer
in
the
dublin
rooms
of
the
political
and
trades
union
became
one
of
the
most
attractive
and
popular
speakers
of
the
british
parliament
one
whose
aid
has
been
courted
and
whose
rebuke
has
been
feared
by
the
ablest
of
england
representatives
amid
the
sneers
of
derision
and
the
clamor
of
hate
and
prejudice
he
has
triumphed
on
that
very
arena
so
fatal
to
irish
eloquence
and
irish
fame
where
even
grattan
failed
to
sustain
himself
and
the
impetuous
spirit
of
flood
was
stricken
down
no
subject
in
which
ireland
was
not
directly
interested
has
received
a
greater
share
of
attention
than
that
of
the
abolition
of
colonial
slavery
utterly
detesting
tyranny
of
all
kinds
he
poured
forth
his
eloquent
soul
in
stern
reprobation
of
a
system
full
at
once
of
pride
and
misery
and
oppression
and
darkened
with
blood
his
speech
on
the
motion
of
thomas
fowell
buxton
for
the
immediate
emancipation
of
the
slaves
gave
a
new
tone
to
the
discussion
of
the
question
he
entered
into
no
petty
pecuniary
details
no
miserable
computation
of
the
shillings
and
pence
vested
in
beings
fashioned
in
the
image
of
god
he
did
not
talk
of
the
expediency
of
continuing
the
evil
because
it
had
grown
monstrous
to
use
his
own
words
he
considered
slavery
a
crime
to
be
abolished
not
merely
an
evil
to
be
palliated
he
left
sir
robert
peel
and
the
tories
to
eulogize
the
characters
and
defend
the
interests
of
the
planters
in
common
with
those
of
a
priesthood
building
their
houses
by
oppression
and
their
chambers
by
wrong
and
spoke
of
the
negro
interest
the
negro
claim
to
justice
demanding
sympathy
for
the
plundered
as
well
as
the
plunderers
for
the
slave
as
well
as
his
master
he
trampled
as
dust
under
his
feet
the
blasphemy
that
obedience
to
the
law
of
eternal
justice
is
a
principle
to
be
acknowledged
in
theory
only
because
unsafe
in
practice
he
would
he
said
enter
into
no
compromise
with
slavery
he
cared
not
what
cast
or
creed
or
color
it
might
assume
whether
personal
or
political
intellectual
or
spiritual
he
was
for
its
total
immediate
abolition
he
was
for
justice
justice
in
the
name
of
humanity
and
according
to
the
righteous
law
of
the
living
god
ardently
admiring
our
free
institutions
and
constantly
pointing
to
our
glorious
political
exaltation
as
an
incentive
to
the
perseverance
of
his
own
countrymen
in
their
struggle
against
oppression
he
has
yet
omitted
no
opportunity
of
rebuking
our
inexcusable
slave
system
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
jefferson
he
has
often
regretted
that
his
practice
should
have
so
illy
accorded
with
his
noble
sentiments
on
the
subject
of
slavery
which
so
fully
coincided
with
his
own
in
truth
wherever
man
has
been
oppressed
by
his
sympathy
has
been
directed
to
italy
chained
above
the
very
grave
of
her
ancient
liberties
to
the
republics
of
southern
america
to
greece
dashing
the
foot
of
the
indolent
ottoman
from
her
neck
to
france
and
belgium
and
last
not
least
to
poland
driven
from
her
cherished
nationality
and
dragged
like
his
own
ireland
bleeding
and
violated
to
the
deadly
embrace
of
her
oppressor
american
slavery
but
shares
in
his
common
denunciation
of
all
tyranny
its
victims
but
partake
of
his
common
pity
for
the
oppressed
and
persecuted
and
the
trodden
down
in
this
hasty
and
imperfect
sketch
we
can
not
enter
into
the
details
of
that
cruel
disregard
of
irish
rights
which
was
manifested
by
a
reformed
parliament
convoked
to
use
the
language
of
william
to
ascertain
the
sense
of
the
people
it
is
perhaps
enough
to
say
that
indignant
refusal
to
receive
as
full
justice
the
measure
of
reform
meted
out
to
ireland
was
fully
justified
by
the
facts
of
the
case
the
irish
reform
bill
gave
ireland
with
one
third
of
the
entire
population
of
the
united
kingdoms
only
one
sixth
of
the
parliamentary
delegation
it
diminished
instead
of
increasing
the
number
of
voters
in
the
towns
and
cities
it
created
a
high
and
aristocratic
franchise
in
many
boroughs
it
established
so
narrow
a
basis
of
franchise
as
to
render
them
liable
to
corruption
and
abuse
as
the
rotten
boroughs
of
the
old
system
it
threw
no
new
power
into
the
hands
of
the
people
and
with
no
little
justice
has
himself
termed
it
an
act
to
restore
to
power
the
orange
ascendancy
in
ireland
and
to
enable
a
faction
to
trample
with
impunity
on
the
friends
of
reform
and
constitutional
freedom
letters
to
the
reformers
of
great
britain
no
in
may
commenced
the
publication
of
his
celebrated
to
the
reformers
of
great
like
tallien
before
the
french
convention
he
rent
away
the
veil
which
hume
and
atwood
had
only
partially
lifted
he
held
up
before
the
people
of
great
britain
the
new
indignities
which
had
been
added
to
the
long
catalogue
of
wrongs
he
appealed
to
their
justice
their
honor
their
duty
for
redress
and
cast
down
before
the
whig
administration
the
gauntlet
of
his
country
defiance
and
scorn
there
is
a
fine
burst
of
indignant
irish
feeling
in
the
concluding
paragraphs
of
his
fourth
letter
i
have
demonstrated
the
contumelious
injuries
inflicted
upon
us
by
this
reform
bill
my
letters
are
long
before
the
public
they
have
been
unrefuted
uncontradicted
in
any
of
their
details
and
with
this
case
of
atrocious
injustice
to
ireland
placed
before
the
reformers
of
great
britain
what
assistance
what
sympathy
do
we
receive
why
i
have
got
some
half
dozen
drivelling
letters
from
political
unions
and
political
characters
asking
me
whether
i
advise
them
to
petition
or
bestir
themselves
in
our
behalf
reformers
of
great
britain
i
do
not
ask
you
either
to
petition
or
be
silent
i
do
not
ask
you
to
petition
or
to
do
any
other
act
in
favor
of
the
irish
you
will
consult
your
own
feelings
of
justice
and
generosity
unprovoked
by
any
advice
or
entreaty
of
mine
for
my
own
part
i
never
despaired
of
ireland
i
do
not
i
will
not
i
can
not
despair
of
my
beloved
country
she
has
in
my
view
obtained
freedom
of
conscience
for
others
as
well
as
for
herself
she
has
shaken
off
the
incubus
of
tithes
while
silly
legislation
was
dealing
out
its
folly
and
its
falsehoods
she
can
and
she
will
obtain
for
herself
justice
and
constitutional
freedom
and
although
she
may
sigh
at
british
neglect
and
ingratitude
there
is
no
sound
of
despair
in
that
sigh
nor
any
want
of
moral
energy
on
her
part
to
attain
her
own
rights
by
peaceable
and
legal
means
the
tithe
system
unutterably
odious
and
full
of
all
injustice
had
prepared
the
way
for
this
expression
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
people
ireland
had
never
in
any
period
of
her
history
bowed
her
neck
peaceably
to
the
ecclesiastical
yoke
from
the
canon
of
cashel
prepared
by
english
deputies
in
the
twelfth
century
decreeing
for
the
first
time
that
tithes
should
be
paid
in
ireland
down
to
the
present
moment
the
church
in
her
borders
has
relied
solely
upon
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
and
literally
reaped
its
tithes
with
the
sword
the
decree
of
the
dublin
synod
under
archbishop
comyn
in
could
only
be
enforced
within
the
pale
of
the
english
settlement
the
attempts
of
henry
viii
also
failed
without
the
pale
all
endeavors
to
collect
tithes
were
met
by
stern
opposition
and
although
from
the
time
of
william
iii
the
tithe
system
has
been
established
in
ireland
yet
at
no
period
has
it
been
regarded
otherwise
than
as
a
system
of
legalized
robbery
by
seven
eighths
of
the
people
an
examination
of
this
system
can
not
fail
to
excite
our
wonder
not
that
it
has
been
thus
regarded
but
that
it
has
been
so
long
endured
by
any
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
least
of
all
by
irishmen
tithes
to
the
amount
of
are
annually
wrung
from
impoverished
ireland
in
support
of
a
clergy
who
can
only
number
about
one
sixteenth
of
her
population
as
their
hearers
and
wrung
too
in
an
undue
proportion
from
the
catholic
counties
see
doyle
evidence
before
hon
g
stanley
in
the
southern
and
middle
counties
almost
entirely
inhabited
by
the
catholic
peasantry
every
thing
they
possess
is
subject
to
the
tithe

the
sarcasm
of

to
these
locusts
of
the

a
beastly
and
pompous
priesthood
political
potentates
and
christian
pastors
full
of
false
zeal
full
of
worldly
pride
and
full
of
gluttony
empty
of

oppressive
to

and

they
poison
with
crooked
principles
and
heated
advice
a
faction
against
their
king
when
they
are
not
his
slaves
ever
the
dirt
under
his
feet
or
a
poniard
to
his
heart
for
the
evils
of
absenteeism
the
of
the
wealthy
landholders
draining
from
a
starving
country
the
very
necessaries
of
life
a
remedy
is
sought
in
a
repeal
of
the
union
and
the
provisions
of
a
domestic
parliament
in
view
a
restoration
of
such
a
parliament
can
alone
afford
that
adequate
protection
to
the
national
industry
so
loudly
demanded
by
thousands
of
unemployed
laborers
starving
amid
the
ruins
of
deserted
manufactories
during
the
brief
period
of
partial
irish
liberty
which
followed
the
pacific
revolution
of
the
manufactures
of
the
country
revived
and
flourished
and
the
smile
of
contented
industry
was
visible
all
over
the
land
in
there
were
in
the
city
of
dublin
alone
there
are
now
but
such
is
the
practical
effect
of
the
union
of
that
suicidal
act
of
the
irish
parliament
which
yielded
up
in
a
moment
of
treachery
and
terror
the
dearest
interests
of
the
country
to
the
legislation
of
an
english
parliament
and
the
tender
mercies
of
castlereagh
of
that
castlereagh
who
when
accused
by
grattan
of
spending
in
purchasing
votes
for
the
union
replied
with
the
rare
audacity
of
iniquity
we
did
spend
and
we
would
have
spent
if
necessary
to
carry
the
union
that
castlereagh
who
when
irishmen
petitioned
against
the
union
and
for
it
maintained
that
the
latter
constituted
the
majority
well
has
it
been
said
that
the
deep
vengeance
which
ireland
owed
him
was
inflicted
by
the
great
criminal
upon
himself
the
nation
which
he
sold
and
plundered
saw
him
make
with
his
own
hand
the
fearful
retribution
the
great
body
of
the
irish
people
never
assented
to
the
union
the
following
extract
from
a
speech
of
earl
then
grey
in
upon
the
union
question
will
show
what
means
were
made
use
of
to
drag
ireland
while
yet
mourning
over
her
slaughtered
children
to
the
marriage
altar
with
england
if
the
parliament
of
ireland
had
been
left
to
itself
untempted
and
unawed
it
would
without
hesitation
have
rejected
the
resolutions
out
of
the
members
strenuously
opposed
the
measure
voted
for
it
of
these
were
placemen
some
of
them
were
english
generals
on
the
staff
without
a
foot
of
ground
in
ireland
and
completely
dependent
on
government
let
us
reflect
upon
the
arts
made
use
of
since
the
last
session
of
the
irish
parliament
to
pack
a
majority
for
union
in
the
house
of
commons
all
persons
holding
offices
under
government
if
they
hesitated
to
vote
as
directed
were
stripped
of
all
their
employments
a
bill
framed
for
preserving
the
purity
of
parliament
was
likewise
abused
and
no
less
than
seats
were
vacated
by
their
holders
having
received
nominal
offices
the
signs
of
the
times
are
most
favorable
to
the
success
of
the
irish
liberator
the
tremendous
power
of
the
english
political
unions
is
beginning
to
develop
itself
in
favor
of
ireland
a
deep
sympathy
is
evinced
for
her
sufferings
and
a
general
determination
to
espouse
her
cause
brute
force
can
not
put
down
the
peaceable
and
legal
agitation
of
the
question
of
her
rights
and
interests
the
spirit
of
the
age
forbids
it
the
agitation
will
go
on
for
it
is
spreading
among
men
who
to
use
the
words
of
the
eloquent
shiel
while
looking
out
upon
the
ocean
and
gazing
upon
the
shore
which
nature
has
guarded
with
so
many
of
her
bulwarks
can
hear
the
language
of
repeal
muttered
in
the
dashing
of
the
very
waves
which
separate
them
from
great
britain
by
a
barrier
of
own
creation
another
bloodless
victory
we
trust
awaits
a
victory
worthy
of
his
heart
and
intellect
unstained
by
one
drop
of
human
blood
unmoistened
by
a
solitary
tear
ireland
will
be
redeemed
and
disenthralled
not
perhaps
by
a
repeal
of
the
union
but
by
the
accomplishment
of
such
a
thorough
reform
in
the
government
and
policy
of
great
britain
as
shall
render
a
repeal
unnecessary
and
impolitic
the
sentiments
of
in
regard
to
the
means
of
effecting
his
object
of
political
reform
are
distinctly
impressed
upon
all
his
appeals
to
the
people
in
his
letter
of
december
to
the
dublin
trades
union
he
says
the
repealers
must
not
have
our
cause
stained
with
blood
far
indeed
from
it
we
can
and
ought
to
carry
the
repeal
only
in
the
total
absence
of
offence
against
the
laws
of
man
or
crime
in
the
sight
of
god
the
best
revolution
which
was
ever
effected
could
not
be
worth
one
drop
of
human
blood
in
his
speech
at
the
public
dinner
given
him
by
the
citizens
of
cork
we
find
a
yet
more
earnest
avowal
of
pacific
principles
it
may
be
stated
said
he
to
countervail
our
efforts
that
this
struggle
will
involve
the
destruction
of
life
and
property
that
it
will
overturn
the
framework
of
civil
society
and
give
an
undue
and
fearful
influence
to
one
rank
to
the
ruin
of
all
others
these
are
awful
considerations
truly
if
risked
i
am
one
of
those
who
have
always
believed
that
any
political
change
is
too
dearly
purchased
by
a
single
drop
of
blood
and
who
think
that
any
political
superstructure
based
upon
other
opinion
is
like
the
fabric
beautiful
in
the
brief
hour
of
sunshine
but
the
moment
one
drop
of
rain
touches
the
arid
basis
melting
away
in
wreck
and
ruin
i
am
an
accountable
being
i
have
a
soul
and
a
god
to
answer
to
in
another
and
better
world
for
my
thoughts
and
actions
in
this
i
disclaim
here
any
act
of
mine
which
would
sport
with
the
lives
of
my
any
amelioration
of
our
social
condition
which
must
be
purchased
by
their
blood
and
here
in
the
face
of
god
and
of
our
common
country
i
protest
that
if
i
did
not
sincerely
and
firmly
believe
that
the
amelioration
i
desire
could
be
effected
without
violence
without
any
change
in
the
relative
scale
of
ranks
in
the
present
social
condition
of
ireland
except
that
change
which
all
must
desire
making
each
better
than
it
was
before
and
cementing
all
in
one
solid
irresistible
mass
i
would
at
once
give
up
the
struggle
which
i
have
always
kept
with
tyranny
i
would
withdraw
from
the
contest
which
i
have
hitherto
waged
with
those
who
would
perpetuate
our
thraldom
i
would
not
for
one
moment
dare
to
venture
for
that
which
in
costing
one
human
life
would
cost
infinitely
too
dear
but
it
will
cost
no
such
price
have
we
not
had
within
my
memory
two
great
political
revolutions
and
had
we
them
not
without
bloodshed
or
violence
to
the
social
compact
have
we
not
arrived
at
a
period
when
physical
force
and
military
power
yield
to
moral
and
intellectual
energy
has
not
the
time
of
arma
togae
come
for
us
and
the
other
nations
of
the
earth
let
us
trust
that
the
prediction
of
will
be
verified
that
reason
and
intellect
are
destined
under
god
to
do
that
for
the
nations
of
the
earth
which
the
physical
force
of
centuries
and
the
red
sacrifice
of
a
thousand
have
failed
to
accomplish
glorious
beyond
all
others
will
be
the
day
when
nation
shall
no
more
rise
up
against
nation
when
as
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
universal
acknowledgment
of
the
rights
of
man
it
shall
no
longer
be
in
the
power
of
an
individual
to
drag
millions
into
strife
for
the
unholy
gratification
of
personal
prejudice
and
passion
the
reformed
governments
of
great
britain
and
france
resting
as
they
do
upon
a
popular
basis
are
already
tending
to
this
consummation
for
the
people
have
suffered
too
much
from
the
warlike
ambition
of
their
former
masters
not
to
have
learned
that
the
gains
of
peaceful
industry
are
better
than
the
wages

butchery

only
with

has
triumphed
over
the
oppression
of
centuries

opened
a
peaceful
pathway
to
the
temple
of
freedom
through
which
its
goddess
may
be
seen
no
longer
propitiated
with
human
sacrifices
like
some
foul
idol

clothed
in

attributes
and
smiling
in
the
beauty
of

all

soothe

malignant
passions

maddened
men
to
throw
open
the

of
justice
to
the
abused
enslaved

persecuted
to
unravel
the
mysteries
of
guilt

hold
up

iniquity
in
the
severe
light
of
truth
stripped
of
their
disguise
and
covered
with
the
confusion
of
their
own
vileness
these
are
victories
more
glorious
than
any
which
have
ever
reddened
the

the

of

attempts
have
been
made
to
prejudice

against

by

republication
on
this
side
of

of

of

his

directed

and
the

for
this
he
has
deservedly

place
in
the

england
under
james
ii
a
review
of
the
first
two
volumes
of
macaulay
of
england
from
the
accession
of
james
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
the
age
we
have
in
these
volumes
an
admirable
example
of
history
made
easy
had
they
been
published
in
his
time
they
might
have
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
poet
gray
who
declared
that
his
ideal
of
happiness
was
to
lie
on
a
sofa
and
read
eternal
new
romances
the
style
is
that
which
lends
such
a
charm
to
the
author
essays
brilliant
epigrammatic
vigorous
indeed
herein
lies
the
fault
of
the
work
when
viewed
as
a
mere
detail
of
historical
facts
its
sparkling
rhetoric
is
not
the
safest
medium
of
truth
to
the
inquirer
a
discriminating
and
able
critic
has
done
the
author
no
injustice
in
saying
that
in
attempting
to
give
effect
and
vividness
to
his
thoughts
and
diction
he
is
often
overstrained
and
extravagant
and
that
his
epigrammatic
style
seems
better
fitted
for
the
glitter
of
paradox
than
the
sober
guise
of
truth
the
intelligent
and
reader
of
the
volume
before
us
will
find
himself
at
times
compelled
to
reverse
the
decisions
of
the
author
and
deliver
some
unfortunate
personage
sect
or
class
from
the
pillory
of
his
rhetoric
and
the
merciless
pelting
of
his
ridicule
there
is
a
want
of
the
repose
and
quiet
which
we
look
for
in
a
narrative
of
events
long
passed
away
we
rise
from
the
perusal
of
the
book
pleased
and
excited
but
with
not
so
clear
a
conception
of
the
actual
realities
of
which
it
treats
as
would
be
desirable
we
can
not
help
feeling
that
the
author
has
been
somewhat
in
avoiding
the
dulness
of
plain
detail
and
the
dryness
of
dates
names
and
statistics
the
freedom
flowing
diction
and
sweeping
generality
of
the
reviewer
and
essayist
are
maintained
throughout
and
with
one
remarkable
exception
the
of
might
be
divided
into
papers
of
magazine
length
and
published
without
any
violence
to
propriety
as
a
continuation
of
the
author
labors
in
that
department
of
literature
in
which
he
confessedly
stands
without
a
rival
historical
review
that
exception
is
however
no
unimportant
one
in
our
view
it
is
the
crowning
excellence
of
the
first
volume
its
distinctive
feature
and
principal
attraction
we
refer
to
the
third
chapter
of
the
volume
from
page
to
page
the
description
of
the
condition
of
england
at
the
period
of
the
accession
of
james
ii
we
know
of
nothing
like
it
in
the
entire
range
of
historical
literature
the
veil
is
lifted
up
from
the
england
of
a
century
and
a
half
ago
its
geographical
industrial
social
and
moral
condition
is
revealed
and
as
the
panorama
passes
before
us
of
lonely
heaths
fortified
bands
of
robbers
rude
country
squires
doling
out
the
odds
and
ends
of
their
coarse
fare
to
clerical
dependents
rough
roads
serviceable
only
for
horseback
travelling
towns
with
unlighted
streets
reeking
with
filth
and
offal
and
prisons
damp
loathsome
infected
with
disease
and
swarming
with
vermin
we
are
filled
with
wonder
at
the
contrast
which
it
presents
to
the
england
of
our
day
we
no
longer
sigh
for
the
good
old
days
the
most
confirmed
grumbler
is
compelled
to
admit
that
bad
as
things
now
are
they
were
far
worse
a
few
generations
back
macaulay
in
this
elaborate
and
carefully
prepared
chapter
has
done
a
good
service
to
humanity
in
disabusing
ignorance
of
the
melancholy
notion
that
the
world
is
growing
worse
and
in
putting
to
silence
the
cant
of
blind
unreasoning
conservatism
in
the
entire
population
of
england
our
author
estimates
at
from
five
millions
to
five
millions
five
hundred
thousand
of
the
eight
hundred
thousand
families
at
that
period
one
half
had
animal
food
twice
a
week
the
other
half
ate
it
not
at
all
or
at
most
not
oftener
than
once
a
week
wheaten
loaves
were
only
seen
at
the
tables
of
the
comparatively
wealthy
rye
barley
and
oats
were
the
food
of
the
vast
majority
the
average
wages
of
workingmen
was
at
least
one
half
less
than
is
paid
in
england
for
the
same
service
at
the
present
day
one
fifth
of
the
people
were
paupers
or
recipients
of
parish
relief
clothing
and
bedding
were
scarce
and
dear
education
was
almost
unknown
to
the
vast
majority
the
houses
and
shops
were
not
numbered
in
the
cities
for
porters
coachmen
and
could
not
read
the
shopkeeper
distinguished
his
place
of
business
by
painted
signs
and
graven
images
oxford
and
cambridge
universities
were
little
better
than
modern
grammar
and
latin
school
in
a
provincial
village
the
country
magistrate
used
on
the
bench
language
too
coarse
brutal
and
vulgar
for
a
modern
fine

in
london
vied
with
each
other
in
the
lowest
ribaldry
and
the
grossest
profanity
the
poets
of
the
time
from
dryden
to
durfey
ministered
to
the
popular
licentiousness
the
most
shameless
indecency
polluted
their
pages
the
theatre
and
the
brothel
were
in
strict
unison
the
church
winked
at
the
vice
which
opposed
itself
to
the
austere
morality
or
hypocrisy
of
puritanism
the
superior
clergy
with
a
few
noble
exceptions
were
and
courtiers
the
inferior
were
idle
ignorant
hangerson
upon
blaspheming
squires
and
knights
of
the
shire
the
domestic
chaplain
of
all
men
living
held
the
most
unenviable
position
if
he
was
permitted
to
dine
with
the
family
he
was
expected
to
content
himself
with
the
plainest
fare
he
might
fill
himself
with
the
corned
beef
and
carrots
but
as
soon
as
the
tarts
and
made
their
appearance
he
quitted
his
seat
and
stood
aloof
till
he
was
summoned
to
return
thanks
for
the
repast
from
a
great
part
of
which
he
had
been
excluded
beyond
the
trent
the
country
seems
at
this
period
to
have
been
in
a
state
of
barbarism
the
parishes
kept
bloodhounds
for
the
purpose
of
hunting
freebooters
the
were
fortified
and
guarded
so
dangerous
was
the
country
that
persons
about
travelling
thither
made
their
wills
judges
and
lawyers
only
ventured
therein
escorted
by
a
strong
guard
of
armed
men
the
natural
resources
of
the
island
were
undeveloped
the
tin
mines
of
cornwall
which
two
thousand
years
before
attracted
the
ships
of
the
merchant
princes
of
tyre
beyond
the
pillars
of
hercules
were
indeed
worked
to
a
considerable
extent
but
the
copper
mines
which
now
yield
annually
fifteen
thousand
tons
were
entirely
neglected
rock
salt
was
known
to
exist
but
was
not
used
to
any
considerable
extent
and
only
a
partial
supply
of
salt
by
evaporation
was
obtained
the
coal
and
iron
of
england
are
at
this
time
the
stable
foundations
of
her
industrial
and
commercial
greatness
but
in
the
great
part
of
the
iron
used
was
imported
only
about
ten
thousand
tons
were
annually
cast
now
eight
hundred
thousand
is
the
average
annual
production
equally
great
has
been
the
increase
in
coal
mining
coal
says
macaulay
though
very
little
used
in
any
species
of
manufacture
was
already
the
ordinary
fuel
in
some
districts
which
were
fortunate
enough
to
possess
large
beds
and
in
the
capital
which
could
easily
be
supplied
by
water
carriage
it
seems
reasonable
to
believe
that
at
least
one
half
of
the
quantity
then
extracted
from
the
pits
was
consumed
in
london
the
consumption
of
london
seemed
to
the
writers
of
that
age
enormous
and
was
often
mentioned
by
them
as
a
proof
of
the
greatness
of
the
imperial
city
they
scarcely
hoped
to
be
believed
when
they
affirmed
that
two
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
chaldrons
that
is
to
say
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
in
the
last
year
of
the
reign
of
charles
brought
to
the
thames
at
present
near
three
millions
and
a
half
of
tons
are
required
yearly
by
the
metropolis
and
the
whole
annual
produce
can
not
on
the
most
moderate
computation
be
estimated
at
less
than
twenty
millions
of
tons
after
thus
passing
in
survey
the
england
of
our
ancestors
five
or
six
generations
back
the
author
closes
his
chapter
with
some
eloquent
remarks
upon
the
progress
of
society
contrasting
the
hardness
and
coarseness
of
the
age
of
which
he
treats
with
the
softer
and
more
humane
features
of
our
own
he
says
nowhere
could
be
found
that
sensitive
and
restless
compassion
which
has
in
our
time
extended
powerful
protection
to
the
factory
child
the
hindoo
widow
to
the
negro
slave
which
pries
into
the
stores
and
of
every
emigrant
ship
which
winces
at
every
lash
laid
on
the
back
of
a
drunken
soldier
which
will
not
suffer
the
thief
in
the
hulks
to
be
ill
fed
or
overworked
and
which
has
repeatedly
endeavored
to
save
the
life
even
of
the
murderer
the
more
we
study
the
annals
of
the
past
the
more
shall
we
rejoice
that
we
live
in
a
merciful
age
in
an
age
in
which
cruelty
is
abhorred
and
in
which
pain
even
when
deserved
is
inflicted
reluctantly
and
from
a
sense
of
duty
every
class
doubtless
has
gained
largely
by
this
great
moral
change
but
the
class
which
has
gained
most
is
the
poorest
the
most
dependent
and
the
most
defenceless
the
history
itself
properly
commences
at
the
close
of
this
chapter
opening
with
the
deathscene
of
the
dissolute
charles
it
presents
a
series
of
brilliant
pictures
of
the
events
succeeding
the
miserable
fate
of
oates
and
dangerfield
the
perjured
inventors
of
the
popish
plot
the
trial
of
baxter
by
the
infamous
jeffreys
the
attempt
of
the
duke
of
monmouth
the
battle
of
sedgemoor
and
the
dreadful
atrocities
of
the
king
soldiers
and
the
horrible
perversion
of
justice
by
the
chief
judge
in
the
bloody
assizes
the
barbarous
hunting
of
the
scotch
dissenters
by
claverbouse
the
melancholy
fate
of
the
brave
and
noble
duke
of
argyle
are
described
with
graphic
power
unknown
to
smollett
or
hume
personal
portraits
are
sketched
with
a
bold
freedom
which
at
times
startles
us
the
old
familiar
faces
as
we
have
seen
them
through
the
dust
of
a
century
and
a
half
start
before
us
with
lifelike
distinctness
of
outline
and
coloring
some
of
them
disappoint
us
like
the
ghost
of
hamlet
father
they
come
in
a
questionable
shape
thus
for
instance
in
his
sketch
of
william
penn
the
historian
takes
issue
with
the
world
on
his
character
and
labors
through
many
pages
of
disingenuous
innuendoes
and
distortion
of
facts
to
transform
the
saint
of
history
into
a
pliant
courtier
the
second
volume
details
the
follies
and
misfortunes
the
decline
and
fall
of
the
last
of
the
stuarts
all
the
art
of
the
author
splendid
rhetoric
is
employed
in
awakening
by
turns
the
indignation
and
contempt
of
the
reader
in
contemplating
the
character
of
the
king
in
portraying
that
character
he
has
brought
into
exercise
all
those
powers
of
invective
and
merciless
ridicule
which
give
such
a
savage
relish
to
his
delineation
of
barrere
to
preserve
the
consistency
of
this
character
he
denies
the
king
any
credit
for
whatever
was
really
beneficent
and
praiseworthy
in
his
government
he
holds
up
the
royal
delinquent
in
only
two
lights
the
one
representing
him
as
a
tyrant
towards
his
people
the
other
as
the
abject
slave
of
foreign
priests
a
man
at
once
hateful
and
ludicrous
of
whom
it
is
difficult
to
speak
without
an
execration
or
a
sneer
the
events
which
preceded
the
revolution
of
the
undisguised
adherence
of
the
king
to
the
church
of
rome
the
partial
toleration
of
the
despised
quakers
and
anabaptists
the
gradual
relaxation
of
the
severity
of
the
penal
laws
against
papists
and
dissenters
preparing
the
way
for
the
royal
proclamation
of
entire
liberty
of
conscience
throughout
the
british
realm
allowing
the
puritan
and
the
papist
priest
to
build
conventicles
and
mass
houses
under
the
very
eaves
of
the
palaces
of
oxford
and
canterbury
the
mining
and
countermining
of
jesuits
and
prelates
are
detailed
with
impartial
minuteness
the
secret
springs
of
the
great
movements
of
the
time
are
laid
bare
the
mean
and
paltry
instrumentalities
are
seen
at
work
in
the
under
world
of
corruption
prejudice
and
falsehood
no
one
save
a
blind
unreasoning
partisan
of
catholicism
or
episcopacy
can
contemplate
this
chapter
in
english
history
without
a
feeling
of
disgust
however
it
may
have
been
overruled
for
good
by
that
providence
which
takes
the
wise
in
their
own
craftiness
the
revolution
of
in
itself
considered
affords
just
as
little
cause
for
on
the
part
of
protestants
as
the
substitution
of
the
supremacy
of
the
crowned
bluebeard
henry
for
that
of
the
pope
in
the
english
church
it
had
little
in
common
with
the
revolution
of
the
field
of
its
action
was
the
closet
of
selfish
intrigue
the
stalls
of
discontented
prelates
the
chambers
of
the
wanton
and
adulteress
the
confessional
of
a
weak
prince
whose
mind
originally
narrow
had
been
cramped
closer
still
by
the
jacket
of
religious
bigotry
and
superstition
the
age
of
nobility
and
heroism
had
passed
away
the
pious
fervor
the
and
the
strict
morality
of
the
puritanism
of
the
days
of
cromwell
and
the
blunt
honesty
and
chivalrous
loyalty
of
the
cavaliers
had
both
measurably
given
place
to
the
corrupting
influences
of
the
licentious
and
infidel
court
of
charles
ii
and
to
the
arrogance
intolerance
and
shameless
of
a
prelacy
which
in
its
day
of
triumph
and
revenge
had
more
than
justified
the
terrible
denunciations
and
scathing
gibes
of
milton
both
catholic
and
protestant
writers
have
misrepresented
james
ii
he
deserves
neither
the
execrations
of
the
one
nor
the
eulogies
of
the
other
the
candid
historian
must
admit
that
he
was
after
all
a
better
man
than
his
brother
charles
ii
he
was
a
sincere
and
bigoted
catholic
and
was
undoubtedly
honest
in
the
declaration
which
he
made
in
that
unlucky
letter
which
burnet
ferreted
out
on
the
continent
that
he
was
prepared
to
make
large
steps
to
build
up
the
catholic
church
in
england
and
if
necessary
to
become
a
martyr
in
her
cause
he
was
proud
austere
and
in
the
treatment
of
his
enemies
he
partook
of
the
cruel
temper
of
his
time
he
was
at
once
ascetic
and
sensual
alternating
between
the
of
penance
and
the
embraces
of
catharine
sedley
his
situation
was
one
of
the
most
difficult
and
embarrassing
which
can
be
conceived
of
he
was
at
once
a
bigoted
papist
and
a
protestant
pope
he
hated
the
french
domination
to
which
his
brother
had
submitted
yet
his
pride
as
sovereign
was
subordinated
to
his
allegiance
to
rome
and
a
superstitious
veneration
for
the
wily
priests
with
which
louis
xiv
surrounded
him
as
the
head
of
anglican
heretics
he
was
compelled
to
submit
to
conditions
galling
alike
to
the
sovereign
and
the
man
he
found
on
his
accession
the
terrible
penal
laws
against
the
papists
in
full
force
the
hangman
knife
was
yet
warm
with
its
ghastly
of
quartering
and
disembowelling
suspected
jesuits
and
victims
of
the
lie
of
titus
oates
the
tower
of
london
had
scarcely
ceased
to
echo
the
groans
of
catholic
confessors
stretched
on
the
rack
by
protestant
inquisitors
he
was
torn
by
conflicting
interests
and
spiritual
and
political
contradictions
the
prelates
of
the
established
church
must
share
the
responsibility
of
many
of
the
worst
acts
of
the
early
part
of
his
reign
oxford
sent
up
its
lawned
deputations
to
mingle
the
voice
of
adulation
with
the
groans
of
tortured
covenanters
and
fawning
ecclesiastics
burned
the
incense
of
irreverent
flattery
under
the
nostrils
of
the
lord
anointed
while
the
blessed
air
of
england
was
tainted
by
the
carcasses
of
the
followers
of
monmouth
rotting
on
a
thousand
gibbets
while
jeffreys
was
threatening
baxter
and
his
presbyterian
friends
with
the
pillory
and
while
quakers
and
baptists
were
only
spared
from
extermination
as
game
preserves
for
the
sport
of
clerical
hunters
while
the
prisons
were
thronged
with
the
heads
of
some
fifteen
thousand
beggared
families
and
dissenters
of
every
name
and
degree
were
chased
from
one
to
another
like
david
among
the
cliffs
of
ziph
and
the
rocks
of
the
wild
goats
the
thanksgivings
and
congratulations
of
prelacy
arose
in
an
unbroken
strain
of
laudation
from
all
the
episcopal
palaces
of
england
what
mattered
it
to
men
in
whose
hearts
to
use
the
language
of
john
milton
the
sour
leaven
of
human
traditions
mixed
with
the
poisonous
dregs
of
hypocrisy
lay
basking
in
the
sunny
warmth
of
wealth
and
promotion
hatching
antichrist
that
the
privileges
of
englishmen
and
the
rights
secured
by
the
great
charter
were
violated
and
trodden
under
foot
so
long
as
usurpation
enured
to
their
own
benefit
but
when
king
james
issued
his
declaration
of
indulgence
and
stretched
his
prerogative
on
the
side
of
tolerance
and
charity
the
zeal
of
the
prelates
for
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
british
constitution
and
the
limiting
of
the
royal
power
flamed
up
into
rebellion
they
forswore
themselves
without
scruple
the
disciples
of
laud
the
asserters
of
kingly
infallibility
and
divine
right
talked
of
usurped
power
and
english
rights
in
the
strain
of
the
very
schismatics
whom
they
had
persecuted
to
the
death
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
james
supposed
that
in
issuing
his
declaration
suspending
the
penal
laws
he
had
transcended
the
rightful
prerogative
of
his
throne
the
power
which
he
exercised
had
been
used
by
his
predecessors
for
far
less
worthy
purposes
and
with
the
approbation
of
many
of
the
very
men
who
now
opposed
him
his
ostensible
object
expressed
in
language
which
even
those
who
condemn
his
policy
can
not
but
admire
was
a
laudable
and
noble
one
we
trust
said
he
that
it
will
not
be
vain
that
we
have
resolved
to
use
our
utmost
endeavors
to
establish
liberty
of
conscience
on
such
just
and
equal
foundations
as
will
render
it
unalterable
and
secure
to
all
people
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion
by
which
future
ages
may
reap
the
benefit
of
what
is
so
undoubtedly
the
general
good
of
the
whole
kingdom
whatever
may
have
been
the
motive
of
this
declaration
even
admitting
the
suspicions
of
his
enemies
to
have
been
true
that
he
advocated
universal
toleration
as
the
only
means
of
restoring
roman
catholics
to
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
which
the
penal
laws
deprived
them
it
would
seem
that
there
could
have
been
no
very
serious
objection
on
the
part
of
real
friends
of
religious
toleration
to
the
taking
of
him
at
his
word
and
placing
englishmen
of
every
sect
on
an
equality
before
the
law
the
catholics
were
in
a
very
small
minority
scarcely
at
that
time
as
numerous
as
the
quakers
and
anabaptists
the
army
the
navy
and
nine
tenths
of
the
people
of
england
were
protestants
real
danger
therefore
from
a
simple
act
of
justice
towards
their
catholic
citizens
the
people
of
england
had
no
ground
for
apprehending
but
the
great
truth
which
is
even
now
but
imperfectly
recognized
throughout
christendom
that
religious
opinions
rest
between
man
and
his
maker
and
not
between
man
and
the
magistrate
and
that
the
domain
of
conscience
is
sacred
was
almost
unknown
to
the
statesmen
and
schoolmen
of
the
seventeenth
century
milton
ultra
liberal
as
he
was
excepted
the
catholics
from
his
plan
of
toleration
locke
yielding
to
the
prejudices
of
the
time
took
the
same
ground
the
enlightened
latitudinarian
ministers
of
the
established
church
men
whose
talents
and
christian
charity
redeem
in
some
measure
the
character
of
that
church
in
the
day
of
its
greatest
power
and
basest
apostasy
stopped
short
of
universal
toleration
the
presbyterians
excluded
quakers
baptists
and
papists
from
the
pale
of
their
charity
with
the
single
exception
of
the
sect
of
which
william
penn
was
a
conspicuous
member
the
idea
of
complete
and
impartial
toleration
was
novel
and
unwelcome
to
all
sects
and
classes
of
the
english
people
hence
it
was
that
the
very
men
whose
liberties
and
estates
had
been
secured
by
the
declaration
and
who
were
thereby
permitted
to
hold
their
meetings
in
peace
and
quietness
used
their
newly
acquired
freedom
in
denouncing
the
king
because
the
same
key
which
had
opened
their
prison
doors
had
also
liberated
the
papists
and
the
quakers
baxter
severe
and
painful
spirit
could
not
rejoice
in
an
act
which
had
indeed
restored
him
to
personal
freedom
but
which
had
in
his
view
also
offended
heaven
and
strengthened
the
powers
of
antichrist
by
extending
the
same
favor
to
jesuits
and
ranters
bunyan
disliked
the
quakers
next
to
the
papists
and
it
greatly
lessened
his
satisfaction
at
his
release
from
bedford
jail
that
it
had
been
brought
about
by
the
influence
of
the
former
at
the
court
of
a
catholic
prince
dissenters
forgot
the
wrongs
and
persecutions
which
they
had
experienced
at
the
hands
of
the
prelacy
and
joined
the
bishops
in
opposition
to
the
declaration
they
almost
magnified
into
christian
confessors
the
prelates
who
remonstrated
against
the
indulgence
and
actually
plotted
against
the
king
for
restoring
them
to
liberty
of
person
and
conscience
the
nightmare
fear
of
popery
overcame
their
love
of
religious
liberty
and
they
meekly
offered
their
necks
to
the
yoke
of
prelacy
as
the
only
security
against
the
heavier
one
of
papist
supremacy
in
a
far
different
manner
the
cleareyed
and
john
milton
met
the
claims
and
demands
of
the
hierarchy
in
his
time
they
entreat
us
said
he
that
we
be
not
weary
of
the
insupportable
grievances
that
our
shoulders
have
hitherto
cracked
under
they
beseech
us
that
we
think
them
fit
to
be
our
justices
of
peace
our
lords
our
highest
officers
of
state
they
pray
us
that
it
would
please
us
to
let
them
still
haul
us
and
wrong
us
with
their
bandogs
and
pursuivants
and
that
it
would
please
the
parliament
that
they
may
yet
have
the
whipping
fleecing
and
flaying
of
us
in
their
diabolical
courts
to
tear
the
flesh
from
our
bones
and
into
our
wide
wounds
instead
of
balm
to
pour
in
the
oil
of
tartar
vitriol
and
mercury
surely
a
right
reasonable
innocent
and
petition
o
the
relenting
bowels
of
the
fathers
considering
the
prominent
part
acted
by
william
penn
in
the
reign
of
james
and
his
active
and
influential
support
of
the
obnoxious
declaration
which
precipitated
the
revolution
of
it
could
hardly
have
been
otherwise
than
that
his
character
should
suffer
from
the
unworthy
suspicions
and
prejudices
of
his
contemporaries
his
views
of
religious
toleration
were
too
far
in
advance
of
the
age
to
be
received
with
favor
they
were
of
necessity
misunderstood
and
misrepresented
all
his
life
he
had
been
urging
them
with
the
earnestness
of
one
whose
convictions
were
the
result
not
so
much
of
human
reason
as
of
what
he
regarded
as
divine
illumination
what
the
council
of
james
yielded
upon
grounds
of
state
policy
he
defended
on
those
of
religious
obligation
he
had
suffered
in
person
and
estate
for
the
exercise
of
his
religion
he
had
travelled
over
holland
and
germany
pleading
with
those
in
authority
for
universal
toleration
and
charity
on
a
sudden
on
the
accession
of
james
the
friend
of
himself
and
his
family
he
found
himself
the
most
influential
untitled
citizen
in
the
british
realm
he
had
free
access
to
the
royal
ear
asking
nothing
for
himself
or
his
relatives
he
demanded
only
that
the
good
people
of
england
should
be
no
longer
despoiled
of
liberty
and
estate
for
their
religious
opinions
james
as
a
catholic
had
in
some
sort
a
common
interest
with
his
dissenting
subjects
and
the
declaration
was
for
their
common
relief
penn
conscious
of
the
rectitude
of
his
own
motives
and
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
christian
duty
of
toleration
welcomed
that
declaration
as
the
precursor
of
the
golden
age
of
liberty
and
love
and
to
men
he
was
not
the
man
to
distrust
the
motives
of
an
act
so
fully
in
accordance
with
his
lifelong
aspirations
and
prayers
he
was
charitable
to
a
fault
his
faith
in
his
was
often
stronger
than
a
clearer
insight
of
their
characters
would
have
justified
he
saw
the
errors
of
the
king
and
deplored
them
he
denounced
jeffreys
as
a
butcher
who
had
been
let
loose
by
the
priests
and
pitied
the
king
who
was
he
thought
swayed
by
evil
counsels
he
remonstrated
against
the
interference
of
the
king
with
magdalen
college
and
reproved
and
rebuked
the
hopes
and
aims
of
the
more
zealous
and
catholics
advising
them
to
be
content
with
simple
toleration
but
the
constitution
of
his
mind
fitted
him
rather
for
the
commendation
of
the
good
than
the
denunciation
of
the
bad
he
had
little
in
common
with
the
bold
and
austere
spirit
of
the
puritan
reformers
he
disliked
their
violence
and
harshness
while
on
the
other
hand
he
was
attracted
and
pleased
by
the
gentle
disposition
and
mild
counsels
of
locke
and
tillotson
and
the
latitudinarians
of
the
english
church
he
was
the
intimate
personal
and
political
friend
of
algernon
sydney
sympathized
with
his
republican
theories
and
shared
his
abhorrence
of
tyranny
civil
and
ecclesiastical
he
found
in
him
a
man
after
his
own
heart
genial
generous
and
loving
faithful
to
duty
and
the
instincts
of
humanity
a
true
christian
gentleman
his
sense
of
gratitude
was
strong
and
his
personal
friendships
sometimes
clouded
his
judgment
in
giving
his
support
to
the
measures
of
james
in
behalf
of
liberty
of
conscience
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
acted
in
consistency
with
his
principles
and
professions
to
have
taken
ground
against
them
he
must
have
given
the
lie
to
his
declarations
from
his
youth
upward
he
could
not
disown
and
deny
his
own
favorite
doctrine
because
it
came
from
the
lips
of
a
catholic
king
and
his
jesuit
advisers
and
in
thus
rising
above
the
prejudices
of
his
time
and
appealing
to
the
reason
and
humanity
of
the
people
of
england
in
favor
of
a
cordial
indorsement
on
the
part
of
parliament
of
the
principles
of
the
declaration
he
believed
that
he
was
subserving
the
best
interests
of
his
beloved
country
and
fulfilling
the
solemn
obligations
of
religious
duty
the
downfall
of
james
exposed
penn
to
peril
and
obloquy
perjured
informers
endeavored
to
swear
away
his
life
and
although
nothing
could
be
proved
against
him
beyond
the
fact
that
he
had
steadily
supported
the
great
measure
of
toleration
he
was
compelled
to
live
secluded
in
his
private
lodgings
in
london
for
two
or
three
years
with
a
proclamation
for
his
arrest
hanging
over
his
head
at
length
the
principal
informer
against
him
having
been
found
guilty
of
perjury
the
government
warrant
was
withdrawn
and
lords
sidney
rochester
and
somers
and
the
duke
of
buckingham
publicly
bore
testimony
that
nothing
had
been
urged
against
him
save
by
impostors
and
that
they
had
known
him
some
of
them
for
thirty
years
and
had
never
known
him
to
do
an
ill
thing
but
many
good
offices
it
is
a
matter
of
regret
that
one
professing
to
hold
the
impartial
pen
of
history
should
have
given
the
sanction
of
his
authority
to
the
slanderous
and
false
imputations
of
such
a
man
as
burnet
who
has
never
been
regarded
as
an
authentic
chronicler
the
pantheon
of
history
should
not
be
lightly
disturbed
a
good
man
character
is
the
world
common
legacy
and
humanity
is
not
so
rich
in
models
of
purity
and
goodness
as
to
be
able
to
sacrifice
such
a
reputation
as
that
of
william
penn
to
the
point
of
an
antithesis
or
the
effect
of
a
paradox
gilbert
burnet
in
liberality
as
a
politician
and
tolerance
as
a
churchman
was
far
in
advance
of
his
order
and
time
it
is
true
that
he
shut
out
the
catholics
from
the
pale
of
his
charity
and
barely
tolerated
the
dissenters
the
idea
of
entire
religious
liberty
and
equality
shocked
even
his
moderate
degree
of
sensitiveness
he
met
penn
at
the
court
of
the
prince
of
orange
and
after
a
long
and
fruitless
effort
to
convince
the
dissenter
that
the
penal
laws
against
the
catholics
should
be
enforced
and
allegiance
to
the
established
church
continue
the
condition
of
qualification
for
offices
of
trust
and
honor
and
that
he
and
his
friends
should
rest
contented
with
simple
toleration
he
became
irritated
by
the
inflexible
adherence
of
penn
to
the
principle
of
entire
religious
freedom
one
of
the
most
worthy
sons
of
the
episcopal
church
thomas
clarkson
alluding
to
this
discussion
says
burnet
never
mentioned
him
penn
afterwards
but
coldly
or
sneeringly
or
in
a
way
to
lower
him
in
the
estimation
of
the
reader
whenever
he
had
occasion
to
speak
of
him
in
his
history
of
his
own
times
he
was
a
man
of
strong
prejudices
he
lived
in
the
midst
of
revolutions
plots
and
intrigues
he
saw
much
of
the
worst
side
of
human
nature
and
he
candidly
admits
in
the
preface
to
his
great
work
that
he
was
inclined
to
think
generally
the
worst
of
men
and
parties
and
that
the
reader
should
make
allowance
for
this
inclination
although
he
had
honestly
tried
to
give
the
truth
king
of
oxford
in
his
anecdotes
of
his
own
times
says
i
knew
burnet
he
was
a
furious
and
easily
imposed
upon
by
any
lying
spirit
of
his
faction
but
he
was
a
better
pastor
than
any
man
who
is
now
seated
on
the
bishops
bench
the
tory
writers
swift
pope
arbuthnot
and
others
have
undoubtedly
exaggerated
the
defects
of
burnet
narrative
while
on
the
other
hand
his
whig
commentators
have
excused
them
on
the
ground
of
his
avowed
and
fierce
partisanship
johnson
in
his
blunt
way
says
i

sir
james
mackintosh
in
the
edinburgh
review
speaks
of
the
bishop
as
an
honest
writer
seldom
substantially
erroneous
though
often
inaccurate
in
points
of
detail
and
macaulay
who
has
quite
too
closely
followed
him
in
his
history
defends
him
as
at
least
quite
as
accurate
as
his
contemporary
writers
and
says
that
in
his
moral
character
as
in
his
intellectual
great
blemishes
were
more
than
compensated
by
great
excellences
the
border
war
of
the
picturesque
site
of
the
now
large
village
of
haverhill
on
the
merrimac
river
was
occupied
a
century
and
a
half
ago
by
some
thirty
dwellings
scattered
at
unequal
distances
along
the
two
principal
roads
one
of
which
running
parallel
with
the
river
intersected
the
other
which
ascended
the
hill
northwardly
and
lost
itself
in
the
dark
woods
the
log
huts
of
the
first
settlers
had
at
that
time
given
place
to
comparatively
spacious
and
commodious
habitations
framed
and
covered
with
sawed
boards
and
cloven
clapboards
or
shingles

were
many
of
them

stories
in
front

the

off
behind

and
small
and
frequently
so
fitted
as
to
be
opened
with
difficulty
and
affording
but
a
scanty
supply
of
light
and
air
two
or
three
of
the
best
constructed
were
occupied
as
garrisons
where
in
addition
to
the
family
small
companies
of
soldiers
were
quartered
on
the
high
grounds
rising
from
the
river
stood
the
mansions
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
little
settlement
larger
and
more
imposing
with
projecting
upper
stories
and
carved
cornices
on
the

the
elaborately
wrought
entablature

might
be
seen

door
was
now
closed
no

filled
its
spacious
hall

partook
of
the
rich
delicacies
of
its
ample
larder

and
respected

by

and
station
to
the
neighboring
graveyard
learned
affable
intrepid
a
sturdy
asserter
of
the
rights
and
liberties
of
the
province
and
so
far
in
advance
of
his
time
as
to
refuse
to
yield
to
the
terrible
witchcraft
delusion
vacating
his
seat
on
the
bench
and
openly
expressing
his
disapprobation
of
the
violent
and
sanguinary
proceedings
of
the
court
wise
in
council
and
prompt
in
action
not
his
own
townsmen
alone
but
the
people
of
the
entire
province
had
reason
to
mourn
the
loss
of
nathaniel
saltonstall
four
years
before
the
events
of
which
we
are
about
to
speak
the
indian
allies
of
the
french
in
canada
suddenly
made
their
appearance
in
the
westerly
part
of
the
settlement
at
the
close
of
a
midwinter
day
six
savages
rushed
into
the
open
gate
of
a
owned
by
one
bradley
who
appears
to
have
been
absent
at
the
time
a
sentinel
stationed
in
the
house
discharged
his
musket
killing
the
foremost
indian
and
was
himself
instantly
shot
down
the
mistress
of
the
house
a
spirited
young
woman
was
making
soap
in
a
large
kettle
over
the
fire
she
seized
her
ladle
and
dashed
the
boiling
liquid
in
the
faces
of
the
assailants
scalding
one
of
them
severely
and
was
only
captured
after
such
a
resistance
as
can
scarcely
be
conceived
of
by
the
delicately
framed
and
tenderly
nurtured
occupants
of
the
places
of
our
grandmothers
after
plundering
the
house
the
indians
started
on
their
long
winter
march
for
canada
tradition
says
that
some
thirteen
persons
probably
women
and
children
were
killed
outright
at
the
garrison
goodwife
bradley
and
four
others
were
spared
as
prisoners
the
ground
was
covered
with
deep
snow
and
the
captives
were
compelled
to
carry
heavy
burdens
of
their
plundered
while
for
many
days
in
succession
they
had
no
other
sustenance
than
bits
of
hide
the
bark
of
trees
and
the
roots
of
wild
onions
and
lilies
in
this
situation
in
the
cold
wintry
forest
and
unattended
the
unhappy
young
woman
gave
birth
to
a
child
its
cries
irritated
the
savages
who
cruelly
treated
it
and
threatened
its
life
to
the
entreaties
of
the
mother
they
replied
that
they
would
spare
it
on
the
condition
that
it
should
be
baptized
after
their
fashion
she
gave
the
little
innocent
into
their
hands
when
with
mock
solemnity
they
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
upon
its
forehead
by
gashing
it
with
their
knives
and
afterwards
barbarously
put
it
to
death
before
the
eyes
of
its
mother
seeming
to
regard
the
whole
matter
as
an
excellent
piece
of
sport
nothing
so
strongly
excited
the
risibilities
of
these
grim
barbarians
as
the
tears
and
cries
of
their
victims
extorted
by
physical
or
mental
agony
capricious
alike
in
their
cruelties
and
their
kindnesses
they
treated
some
of
their
captives
with
forbearance
and
consideration
and
tormented
others
apparently
without
cause
one
man
on
his
way
to
canada
was
killed
because
they
did
not
like
his
looks
he
was
so
sour
another
because
he
was
old
and
good
for
nothing
one
of
their
own
number
who
was
suffering
greatly
from
the
effects
of
the
scalding
soap
was
derided
and
mocked
as
a
fool
who
had
let
a
squaw
whip
him
while
on
the
other
hand
the
energy
and
spirit
manifested
by
goodwife
bradley
in
her
defence
was
a
constant
theme
of
admiration
and
gained
her
so
much
respect
among
her
captors
as
to
protect
her
from
personal
injury
or
insult
on
her
arrival
in
canada
she
was
sold
to
a
french
farmer
by
whom
she
was
kindly
treated
in
the
mean
time
her
husband
made
every
exertion
in
his
power
to
ascertain
her
fate
and
early
in
the
next
year
learned
that
she
was
a
slave
in
canada
he
immediately
set
off
through
the
wilderness
on
foot
accompanied
only
by
his
dog
who
drew
a
small
sled
upon
which
he
carried
some
provisions
for
his
sustenance
and
a
bag
of
snuff
which
the
governor
of
the
province
gave
him
as
a
present
to
the
governor
of
canada
after
encountering
almost
incredible
hardships
and
dangers
with
a
perseverance
which
shows
how
well
he
appreciated
the
good
qualities
of
his
stolen
helpmate
he
reached
montreal
and
betook
himself
to
the
governor
residence
ragged
and
wasted
with
cold
and
hunger
he
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
vaudreuil
the
courtly
frenchman
civilly
received
the
gift
of
the
bag
of
snuff
listened
to
the
poor
fellow
story
and
put
him
in
a
way
to
redeem
his
wife
without
difficulty
the
joy
of
the
latter
on
seeing
her
husband
in
the
strange
land
of
her
captivity
may
well
be
imagined
they
returned
by
water
landing
at
boston
early
in
the
summer
there
is
a
tradition
that
this
was
not
the
goodwife
first
experience
of
indian
captivity
the
late
abiel
abbott
in
his
manuscript
of
judith
whiting
of
the
indian
states
that
she
had
previously
been
a
prisoner
probably
before
her
marriage
after
her
return
she
lived
quietly
at
the
until
the
summer
of
the
next
year
one
bright
a
party
of
indians
were
seen
silently
and
cautiously
approaching
the
only
occupants
of
the
garrison
at
that
time
were
bradley
his
wife
and
children
and
a
servant
the
three
adults
armed
themselves
with
muskets
and
prepared
to
defend
themselves
goodwife
bradley
supposing
the
indians
had
come
with
the
intention
of
again
capturing
her
encouraged
her
husband
to
fight
to
the
last
declaring
that
she
had
rather
die
on
her
own
hearth
than
fall
into
their
hands
the
indians
rushed
upon
the
garrison
and
assailed
the
thick
oaken
door
which
they
forced
partly
open
when
a
shot
from
goodwife
bradley
laid
the
foremost
dead
on
the
threshold
the
loss
of
their
leader
so
disheartened
them
that
they
made
a
hasty
retreat
the
year
passed
away
without
any
attack
upon
the
exposed
frontier
settlement
a
feeling
of
comparative
security
succeeded
to
the
almost
sleepless
anxiety
and
terror
of
the
inhabitants
and
they
were
beginning
to
congratulate
each
other
upon
the
termination
of
their
long
and
bitter
trials
but
the
end
was
not
yet
early
in
the
spring
of
the
principal
tribes
of
indians
in
alliance
with
the
french
held
a
great
council
and
agreed
to
furnish
three
hundred
warriors
for
an
expedition
to
the
english
frontier
they
were
joined
by
one
hundred
french
canadians
and
several
volunteers
consisting
of
officers
of
the
french
army
and
younger
sons
of
the
nobility
adventurous
and
unscrupulous
the
sieur
de
chaillons
and
hertel
de
rouville
distinguished
as
a
partisan
in
former
expeditions
cruel
and
unsparing
as
his
indian
allies
commanded
the
french
troops
the
indians
marshalled
under
their
several
chiefs
obeyed
the
general
orders
of
la
perriere
a
catholic
priest
accompanied
them
de
ronville
with
the
french
troops
and
a
portion
of
the
indians
took
the
route
by
the
river
francois
about
the
middle
of
summer
la
perriere
with
the
french
mohawks
crossed
lake
champlain
the
place
of
rendezvous
was
lake
nickisipigue
on
the
way
a
huron
accidentally
killed
one
of
his
companions
whereupon
the
tribe
insisted
on
halting
and
holding
a
council
it
was
gravely
decided
that
this
accident
was
an
evil
omen
and
that
the
expedition
would
prove
disastrous
and
in
spite
of
the
endeavors
of
the
french
officers
the
whole
band
deserted
next
the
mohawks
became
dissatisfied
and
refused
to
proceed
to
the
entreaties
and
promises
of
their
french
allies
they
replied
that
an
infectious
disease
had
broken
out
among
them
and
that
if
they
remained
it
would
spread
through
the
whole
army
the
french
partisans
were
not
deceived
by
a
falsehood
so
transparent
but
they
were
in
no
condition
to
enforce
obedience
and
with
bitter
execrations
and
reproaches
they
saw
the
mohawks
turn
back
on
their
warpath
the
diminished
army
pressed
on
to
nickisipigue
in
the
expectation
of
meeting
agreeably
to
their
promise
the
norridgewock
and
penobscot
indians
they
found
the
place
deserted
and
after
waiting
for
some
days
were
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
eastern
tribes
had
broken
their
pledge
of
cooperation
under
these
circumstances
a
council
was
held
and
the
original
design
of
the
expedition
namely
the
destruction
of
the
whole
line
of
frontier
towns
beginning
with
portsmouth
was
abandoned
they
had
still
a
sufficient
force
for
the
surprise
of
a
single
settlement
and
haverhill
on
the
merrimac
was
selected
for
conquest
in
the
mean
time
intelligence
of
the
expedition
greatly
exaggerated
in
point
of
numbers
and
object
had
reached
boston
and
governor
dudley
had
despatched
troops
to
the
more
exposed
out
posts
of
the
provinces
of
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
forty
men
under
the
command
of
major
turner
and
captains
price
and
gardner
were
stationed
at
haverhill
in
the
different
at
first
a
good
degree
of
vigilance
was
manifested
but
as
days
and
weeks
passed
without
any
alarm
the
inhabitants
relapsed
into
their
old
habits
and
some
even
began
to
believe
that
the
rumored
descent
of
the
indians
was
only
a
pretext
for
quartering
upon
them
of
lazy
rollicking
soldiers
who
certainly
seemed
more
expert
in
making
love
to
their
daughters
and
drinking
their
best
ale
and
cider
than
in
patrolling
the
woods
or
putting
the
garrisons
into
a
defensible
state
the
grain
and
hay
harvest
ended
without
disturbance
the
men
worked
in
their
fields
and
the
women
pursued
their
household
avocations
without
any
very
serious
apprehension
of
danger
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
was
an
eccentric
fellow
named
keezar
who
led
a
wandering
unsettled
life
oscillating
like
a
crazy
pendulum
between
haverhill
and
amesbury
he
had
a
smattering
of
a
variety
of
trades
was
a
famous
wrestler
and
for
a
mug
of
ale
would
leap
over
an
with
the
unspilled
beverage
in
his
hand
on
one
occasion
when
at
supper
his
wife
complained
that
she
had
no
tin
dishes
and
as
there
were
none
to
be
obtained
nearer
than
boston
he
started
on
foot
in
the
evening
travelled
through
the
woods
to
the
city
and
returned
with
his
ware
by
sunrise
the
next
morning
passing
over
a
distance
of
between
sixty
and
seventy
miles
the
tradition
of
his
strange
habits
feats
of
strength
and
wicked
practical
jokes
is
still
common
in
his
native
town
on
the
morning
of
the
of
the
eighth
month
he
was
engaged
in
taking
home
his
horse
which
according
to
his
custom
he
had
turned
into
his
neighbor
rich
clover
field
the
evening
previous
by
the
gray
light
of
dawn
he
saw
a
long
file
of
men
marching
silently
towards
the
town
he
hurried
back
to
the
village
and
gave
the
alarm
by
firing
a
gun
previous
to
this
however
a
young
man
belonging
to
a
neighboring
town
who
had
been
spending
the
night
with
a
young
woman
of
the
village
had
met
the
advance
of
the
and
turning
back
in
extreme
terror
and
confusion
thought
only
of
the
safety
of
his
betrothed
and
passed
silently
through
a
considerable
part
of
the
village
to
her
dwelling
after
he
had
effectually
concealed
her
he
ran
out
to
give
the
alarm
but
it
was
too
late
keezar
gun
was
answered
by
the
terrific
yells
whistling
and
whooping
of
the
indians
house
after
house
was
assailed
and
captured
men
women
and
children
were
massacred
the
minister
of
the
town
was
killed
by
a
shot
through
his
door
two
of
his
children
were
saved
by
the
courage
and
sagacity
of
his
negro
slave
hagar
she
carried
them
into
the
cellar
and
covered
them
with
tubs
and
then
crouched
behind
a
barrel
of
meat
just
in
time
to
escape
the
vigilant
eyes
of
the
enemy
who
entered
the
cellar
and
plundered
it
she
saw
them
pass
and
repass
the
tubs
under
which
the
children
lay
and
take
meat
from
the
very
barrel
which
concealed
herself
three
soldiers
were
quartered
in
the
house
but
they
made
no
defence
and
were
killed
while
begging
for
quarter
the
wife
of
thomas
hartshorne
after
her
husband
and
three
sons
had
fallen
took
her
younger
children
into
the
cellar
leaving
an
infant
on
a
bed
in
the
garret
fearful
that
its
cries
would
betray
her
place
of
concealment
if
she
took
it
with
her
the
indians
entered
the
garret
and
tossed
the
child
out
of
the
window
upon
a
pile
of
clapboards
where
it
was
afterwards
found
stunned
and
insensible
it
recovered
nevertheless
and
became
a
man
of
remarkable
strength
and
stature
and
it
used
to
be
a
standing
joke
with
his
friends
that
he
had
been
stinted
by
the
indians
when
they
threw
him
out
of

window

were
pursued
and
overtaken
just
as

took
place
in

two

three
were
sent
back
by

to
the
english
soldiers
that
if
they
pursued
the
party
on

retreat
to

the

prisoners
should
be
put
to

one
of

to
carry
a

pack
and
was
led
by
an
indian
by
a
cord
round
his
neck
the
whole
party
suffered
terribly
from
hunger
on
reaching
canada
the
indians
shaved
one
side
of
his
head
and
greased
the
other
and
painted
his
face
at
a
fort
nine
miles
from
montreal
a
council
was
held
in
order
to
decide
his
fate
and
he
had
the
unenviable
privilege
of
listening
to
a
protracted
discussion
upon
the
expediency
of
burning
him
the
fire
was
already
kindled
and
the
poor
fellow
was
preparing
to
meet
his
doom
with
firmness
when
it
was
announced
to
him
that
his
life
was
spared
this
result
of
the
council
by
no
means
satisfied
the
women
and
boys
who
had
anticipated
rare
sport
in

roasting
of

man

a
heretic
one
squaw
assailed
him
with
a
knife
and
cut
off
one
of
his
fingers
another
beat
him
with
a
pole
the
indians
spent
the
night
in
dancing
and
singing
compelling
their
prisoner
to
go
round
the
ring
with
them
in
the
morning
one
of
their
orators
made
a
long
speech
to
him
and
formally
delivered
him
over
to
an
old
squaw
who
took
him
to
her
wigwam
and
treated
him
kindly

instances
of
this
kind
were
by
no

wars
the
simple
manners
gayety
and
social
habits
of
the
french

among
whom
the

were

to
have
been

the
of

witnessed
an
awful
commotion
in
the
little
village
of
ipswich
old
men
and
boys
the
had
marched
to
lexington
some
days
before
and
all
the
women
in
the
place
who
were
not
bedridden
or
sick
came
rushing
as
with
one
accord
to
the
green
in
front
of
the
a
rumor
which
no
one
attempted
to
trace
or
authenticate
spread
from
lip
to
lip
that
the
british
regulars
had
landed
on
the
coast
and
were
marching
upon
the
town
a
scene
of
indescribable
terror
and
confusion
followed
defence
was
out
of
the
question
as
the
young
and
men
of
the
entire
region
round
about
had
marched
to
cambridge
and
lexington
the
news
of
the
battle
at
the
latter
place
exaggerated
in
all
its
details
had
been
just
received
terrible
stories
of
the
atrocities
committed
by
the
dreaded
regulars
had
been
related
and
it
was
believed
that
nothing
short
of
a
general
extermination
of
the
patriots
men
women
and
children
was
contemplated
by
the
british
almost
simultaneously
the
people
of
beverly
a
village
a
few
miles
distant
were
smitten
with
the
same
terror
how
the
rumor
was
communicated
no
one
could
tell
it
was
there
believed
that
the
enemy
had
fallen
upon
ipswich
and
massacred
the
inhabitants
without
regard
to
age
or
sex
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
of
this
day
that
the
people
of
newbury
ten
miles
farther
north
assembled
in
an
informal
meeting
at
the
to
hear
accounts
from
the
lexington
fight
and
to
consider
what
action
was
necessary
in
consequence
of
that
event
parson
carey
was
about
opening
the
meeting
with
prayer
when
hurried
sounded
up
the
street
and
a
messenger
and
panting
for
breath
rushed
up
the
staircase
turn
out
turn
out
for
god
sake
he
cried
or
you
will
be
all
killed
the
regulars
are
marching
onus
they
are
at
ipswich
now
cutting
and
slashing
all
before
them
universal
consternation
was
the
immediate
result
of
this
fearful
announcement
parson
carey
prayer
died
on
his
lips
the
congregation
dispersed
over
the
town
carrying
to
every
house
the
tidings
that
the
regulars
had
come
men
on
horseback
went
galloping
up
and
down
the
streets
shouting
the
alarm
women
and
children
echoed
it
from
every
corner
the
panic
became
irresistible
uncontrollable
cries
were
heard
that
the
dreaded
invaders
had
reached
oldtown
bridge
a
little
distance
from
the
village
and
that
they
were
killing
all
whom
they
encountered
flight
was
resolved
upon
all
the
horses
and
vehicles
in
the
town
were
put
in
requisition
men
women
and
children
hurried
as
for
life
towards
the
north
some
threw
their
silver
and
pewter
ware
and
other
valuables
into
wells
large
numbers
crossed
the
merrimac
and
spent
the
night
in
the
deserted
houses
of
salisbury
whose
inhabitants
stricken
by
the
strange
terror
had
fled
into
new
hampshire
to
take
up
their
lodgings
in
dwellings
also
abandoned
by
their
owners
a
few
individuals
refused
to
fly
with
the
multitude
some
unable
to
move
by
reason
of
sickness
were
left
behind
by
their
relatives
one
old
gentleman
whose
excessive
corpulence
rendered
retreat
on
his
part
impossible
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
seating
himself
in
his
doorway
with
his
loaded
king
arm
upbraided
his
more
nimble
neighbors
advising
them
to
do
as
he
did
and
stop
and
shoot
the
devils
many
ludicrous
instances
of
the
intensity
of
the
terror
might
be
related
one
man
got
his
family
into
a
boat
to
go
to
ram
island
for
safety
he
imagined
he
was
pursued
by
the
enemy
through
the
dusk
of
the
evening
and
was
annoyed
by
the
crying
of
an
infant
in
the
after
part
of
the
boat
do
throw
that
squalling
brat
overboard
he
called
to
his
wife
or
we
shall
be
all
discovered
and
killed
a
poor
woman
ran
four
or
five
miles
up
the
river
and
stopped
to
take
breath
and
nurse
her
child
when
she
found
to
her
great
horror
that
she
had
brought
off
the
cat
instead
of
the
baby
all
through
that
memorable
night
the
terror
swept
onward
towards
the
north
with
a
speed
which
seems
almost
miraculous
producing
everywhere
the
same
results
at
midnight
a
horseman
clad
only
in
shirt
and
breeches
dashed
by
our
grandfather
door
in
haverhill
twenty
miles
up
the
river
turn
out
get
a
musket
turn
out
he
shouted
the
regulars
are
landing
on
plum
island
i
glad
of
it
responded
the
old
gentleman
from
his
chamber
window
i
wish
they
were
all
there
and
obliged
to
stay
there
when
it
is
understood
that
plum
island
is
little
more
than
a
naked
the
benevolence
of
this
wish
can
be
readily
appreciated
all
the
boats
on
the
river
were
constantly
employed
for
several
hours
in
conveying
across
the
terrified
fugitives
through
the
dead
waste
and
middle
of
the
night
they
fled
over
the
border
into
new
hampshire
some
feared
to
take
the
frequented
roads
and
wandered
over
wooded
hills
and
through
swamps
where
the
snows
of
the
late
winter
had
scarcely
melted
they
heard
the
tramp
and
outcry
of
those
behind
them
and
fancied
that
the
sounds
were
made
by
pursuing
enemies
fast
as
they
fled
the
terror
by
some
unaccountable
means
outstripped
them
they
found
houses
deserted
and
streets
strewn
with
household
stuffs
abandoned
in
the
hurry
of
escape
towards
morning
however
the
tide
partially
turned
grown
men
began
to
feel
ashamed
of
their
fears
the
old
hardihood
paused
and
looked
the
terror
in
its
face
single
or
in
small
parties
armed
with
such
weapons
as
they
found
at
hand
among
which
long
poles
sharpened
and
charred
at
the
end
were
conspicuous
they
began
to
retrace
their
steps
in
the
mean
time
such
of
the
good
people
of
ipswich
as
were
unable
or
unwilling
to
leave
their
homes
became
convinced
that
the
terrible
rumor
which
had
nearly
depopulated
their
settlement
was
unfounded
among
those
who
had
there
awaited
the
onslaught
of
the
regulars
was
a
young
man
from
exeter
new
hampshire
becoming
satisfied
that
the
whole
matter
was
a
delusion
he
mounted
his
horse
and
followed
after
the
retreating
multitude
undeceiving
all
whom
he
overtook
late
at
night
he
reached
newburyport
greatly
to
the
relief
of
its
sleepless
inhabitants
and
hurried
across
the
river
proclaiming
as
he
rode
the
welcome
tidings
the
sun
rose
upon
haggard
and
jaded
fugitives
worn
with
excitement
and
fatigue
slowly
returning
homeward
their
satisfaction
at
the
absence
of
danger
somewhat
moderated
by
an
unpleasant
consciousness
of
the
ludicrous
scenes
of
their
premature
night
flitting
any
inference
which
might
be
drawn
from
the
foregoing
narrative
derogatory
to
the
character
of
the
people
of
new
england
at
that
day
on
the
score
of
courage
would
be
essentially
erroneous
it
is
true
they
were
not
the
men
to
court
danger
or
rashly
throw
away
their
lives
for
the
mere
glory
of
the
sacrifice
they
had
always
a
prudent
and
wholesome
regard
to
their
own
comfort
and
safety
they
justly
looked
upon
sound
heads
and
limbs
as
better
than
broken
ones
life
was
to
them
too
serious
and
important
and
their
property
too
valuable
to
be
lightly
hazarded
they
never
attempted
to
cheat
themselves
by
the
difficulty
to
be
encountered
or
shutting
their
eyes
to
its
probable
consequences
cautious
wary
schooled
in
the
subtle
strategy
of
indian
warfare
where
is
by
no
means
a
secondary
object
they
had
little
in
common
with
the
reckless
enthusiasm
of
their
french
allies
or
the
stolid
indifference
of
the
fighting
machines
of
the
british
regular
army
when
danger
could
no
longer
be
avoided
they
met
it
with
firmness
and
iron
endurance
but
with
a
very
vivid
appreciation
of
its
magnitude
indeed
it
must
be
admitted
by
all
who
are
familiar
with
the
history
of
our
fathers
that
the
element
of
fear
held
an
important
place
among
their
characteristics
it
exaggerated
all
the
dangers
of
their
earthly
pilgrimage
and
peopled
the
future
with
shapes
of
evil
their
fear
of
satan
invested
him
with
some
of
the
attributes
of
omnipotence
and
almost
reached
the
point
of
reverence
the
slightest
shock
of
an
earthquake
filled
all
hearts
with
terror
stout
men
trembled
by
their
hearths
with
dread
of
some
paralytic
old
woman
supposed
to
be
a
witch
and
when
they
believed
themselves
called
upon
to
grapple
with
these
terrors
and
endure
the
afflictions
of
their
allotment
they
brought
to
the
trial
a
capability
of
suffering
undiminished
by
the
chloroform
of
modern
philosophy
they
were
heroic
in
endurance
panics
like
the
one
we
have
described
might
bow
and
sway
them
like
reeds
in
the
wind
but
they
stood
up
like
the
oaks
of
their
own
forests
beneath
the
thunder
and
the
hail
of
actual
calamity
it
was
certainly
lucky
for
the
good
people
of
essex
county
that
no
wicked
wag
of
a
tory
undertook
to
immortalize
in
rhyme
their
ridiculous
hegira
as
judge
hopkinson
did
the
famous
battle
of
the
kegs
in
philadelphia
like
the
more
recent
madawaska
war
in
maine
the
great
chepatchet
demonstration
in
rhode
island
and
the
sauk
fuss
of
wisconsin
it
remains
to
this
day
unsyllabled
unsung
and
the
memory
of
age
alone
preserves
the
unwritten
history
of
the
great
ipswich
fright

of

to

its
hierarchy
in

with
the

at

old
popular
custom
a
grim
piece
of
protestant
sport
which
since
the
days
of
lord
george
gordon
and
the
no
popery
mob
had
very
generally
fallen
into
disuse
on
the
of
the
eleventh
month
of
this
present
year
all
england
was
traversed
by
processions
and
lighted
up
with
bonfires
in
commemoration
of
the
detection
of
the
gunpowder
plot
of
guy
fawkes
and
the
papists
in
popes
bishops
and
cardinals
in
straw
and
pasteboard
were
paraded
through
the
streets
and
burned
amid
the
shouts
of
the
populace
a
great
portion
of
whom
would
have
doubtless
been
quite
as
ready
to
do
the
same
pleasant
little
office
for
the
bishop
of
exeter
or
his
grace
of
canterbury
if
they
could
have
carted
about
and
burned
in
effigy
a
protestant
hierarchy
as
safely
as
a
catholic
one
in
this
country
where
every
sect
takes
its
own
way
undisturbed
by
legal
restrictions
each
ecclesiastical
tub
balancing
itself
as
it
best
may
on
its
own
bottom
and
where
bishops
catholic
and
bishops
episcopal
bishops
methodist
and
bishops
mormon
jostle
each
other
in
our
thoroughfares
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
we
should
trouble
ourselves
with
the
matter
at
issue
between
the
rival
hierarchies
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
it
is
a
very
pretty
quarrel
however
and
good
must
come
out
of
it
as
it
can
not
fail
to
attract
popular
attention
to
the
shallowness
of
the
spiritual
pretensions
of
both
parties
and
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
a
hierarchy
of
any
sort
has
very
little
in
common
with
the
fishermen
and
of
the
new
testament
pope
night
the
anniversary
of
the
discovery
of
the
papal
incendiary
guy
fawkes
booted
and
spurred
ready
to
touch
fire
to
his
under
the
parliament
house
was
celebrated
by
the
early
settlers
of
new
england
and
doubtless
afforded
a
good
deal
of
relief
to
the
younger
plants
of
grace
in
the
puritan
vineyard
in
those
solemn
old
days
the
recurrence
of
the
anniversary
with
its
processions
hideous
images
of
the
pope
and
guy
fawkes
its
liberal
potations
of
strong
waters
and
its
blazing
bonfires
reddening
the
wild
november
hills
must
have
been
looked
forward
to
with
no
slight
degree
of
pleasure
for
one
night
at
least
the
cramped
and
smothered
fun
and
mischief
of
the
younger
generation
were
permitted
to
revel
in
the
wild
extravagance
of
a
roman
saturnalia
or
the
christmas
holidays
of
a
slave
plantation
bigotry
frowning
upon
the
with
its
flower
wreaths
and
sportive
revellers
and
counting
the
steps
of
the
dancers
as
so
many
steps
towards
perdition
recognized
in
the
grim
farce
of
guy
fawkes
anniversary
something
of
its
own
lineaments
smiled
complacently
upon
the
riotous
young
actors
and
opened
its
close
purse
to
furnish
to
roast
the
pope
and
strong
water
to
moisten
the
throats
of
his
noisy
judges
and
executioners
up
to
the
time
of
the
revolution
the
powder
plot
was
duly
commemorated
throughout
new
england
at
that
period
the
celebration
of
it
was
discountenanced
and
in
many
places
prohibited
on
the
ground
that
it
was
insulting
to
our
catholic
allies
from
france
in
coffin
history
of
newbury
it
is
stated
that
in
the
town
authorities
of
newburyport
ordered
that
no
effigies
be
carried
about
or
exhibited
only
in
the
daytime
the
last
public
celebration
in
that
town
was
in
the
following
year
long
before
the
close
of
the
last
century
the
exhibitions
of
pope
night
had
entirely
ceased
throughout
the
country
with
as
far
as
we
can
learn
a
solitary
exception
the
stranger
who
chances
to
be
travelling
on
the
road
between
newburyport
and
haverhill
on
the
night
of
the
of
november
may
well
fancy
that
an
invasion
is
threatened
from
the
sea
or
that
an
insurrection
is
going
on
inland
for
from
all
the
high
hills
overlooking
the
river
tall
fires
are
seen
blazing
redly
against
the
cold
dark
autumnal
sky
surrounded
by
groups
of
young
men
and
boys
busily
engaged
in
urging
them
with
fresh
fuel
into
intenser
activity
to
feed
these
bonfires
everything
combustible
which
could
be
begged
or
stolen
from
the
neighboring
villages
and
fences
is
put
in
requisition
old
purloined
from
the

barrels
from

stored
away
for
days
and
perhaps
weeks
in
the
woods
or
in
the
gullies
of
the
hills
in
preparation
for
pope
night
from
the
earliest
settlement
of
the
towns
of
amesbury
and
salisbury
the
night
of
the
powder
plot
has
been
thus
celebrated
with
unbroken
regularity
down
to
the
present
time
the
event
which
it
once
commemorated
is
probably
now
unknown
to
most
of
the
juvenile
actors
the
symbol
lives
on
from
generation
to
generation
after
the
significance
is
lost
and
we
have
seen
the
children
of
our
catholic
neighbors
as
busy
as
their
protestant
playmates
in
collecting
by
hook
or
by
crook
the
materials
for
night
bonfires
we
remember
on
one
occasion
walking
out
with
a
gifted
and
learned
catholic
friend
to
witness
the
fine
effect
of
the
illumination
on
the
hills
and
his
hearty
appreciation
of
its
picturesque
and
wild
beauty
the
busy
groups
in
the
strong
relief
of
the
fires
and
the
play
and
corruscation
of
the
changeful
lights
on
the
bare
brown
hills
naked
trees
and
autumn
clouds
in
addition
to
the
bonfires
on
the
hills
there
was
formerly
a
procession
in
the
streets
bearing
grotesque
images
of
the
pope
his
cardinals
and
friars
and
behind
them
satan
himself
a
monster
with
huge
on
his
head
and
a
long
tail
brandishing
his
pitchfork
and
goading
them
onward
the
pope
was
generally
furnished
with
a
movable
head
which
could
be
turned
round
thrown
back
or
made
to
bow
like
that
of
a
ware
mandarin
an
aged
inhabitant
of
the
neighborhood
has
furnished
us
with
some
fragments
of
the
songs
sung
on
such
occasions
probably
the
same
which
our
british
ancestors
trolled
forth
around
their
bonfires
two
centuries
ago
the
fifth
of
november
as
you
well
remember
was
gunpowder
treason
and
plot
and
where
is
the
reason
that
gunpowder
treason
should
ever
be
forgot
when
james
the
first
the
sceptre
swayed
this
hellish
powder
plot
was
laid
they
placed
the
powder
down
below
all
for
old
england
overthrow
lucky
the
man
and
happy
the
day
that
caught
guy
fawkes
in
the
middle
of
his
play
hark
our
bell
goes
jink
jink
jink
pray
madam
pray
sir
give
us
something
to
drink
pray
madam
pray
sir
if
you
something
give
we
burn
the
dog
and
not
let
him
live
we
burn
the
dog
without
his
head
and
then
you
say
the
dog
is
dead
look
here
from
rome
the
pope
has
come
that
fiery
serpent
dire
here
the
pope
that
we
have
got
the
old
promoter
of
the
plot
we
stick
a
pitchfork
in
his
back
and
throw
him
in
the
fire
there
is
a
slight
savor
of
a
smithfield
roasting
about
these
lines
such
as
regaled
the
senses
of
the
virgin
queen
or
bloody
mary
which
entirely
reconciles
us
to
their
disuse
at
the
present
time
it
should
be
the
fervent
prayer
of
all
good
men
that
the
evil
spirit
of
religious
hatred
and
intolerance
which
on
the
one
hand
prompted
the
gunpowder
plot
and
which
on
the
other
has
ever
since
made
it
the
occasion
of
reproach
and
persecution
of
an
entire
sect
of
professing
christians
may
be
no
longer
perpetuated
in
the
matter
of
exclusiveness
and
intolerance
none
of
the
older
sects
can
safely
reproach
each
other
and
it
becomes
all
to
hope
and
labor
for
the
coming
of
that
day
when
the
hymns
of
cowper
and
the
confessions
of
augustine
the
humane
philosophy
of
channing
and
the
devout
meditations
of
thomas
a
kempis
the
simple
essays
of
woolman
and
the
glowing
periods
of
bossuet
shall
be
regarded
as
the
offspring
of
one
spirit
and
one
faith

an
incident
of
the
indian
war
of
the
township
of
haverhill
even
as
late
as
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
a
frontier
settlement
occupying
an
advanced
position
in
the
great
wilderness
which
unbroken
by
the
clearing
of
a
white
man
extended
from
the
merrimac
river
to
the
french
villages
on
the
francois
a
tract
of
twelve
miles
on
the
river
and
three
or
four
northwardly
was
occupied
by
scattered
settlers
while
in
the
centre
of
the
town
a
compact
village
had
grown
up
in
the
immediate
vicinity
there
were
but
few
indians
and
these
generally
peaceful
and
inoffensive
on
the
breaking
out
of
the
narragansett
war
the
inhabitants
had
erected
fortifications
and
taken
other
measures
for
defence
but
with
the
possible
exception
of
one
man
who
was
found
slain
in
the
woods
in
none
of
the
inhabitants
were
molested
and
it
was
not
until
about
the
year
that
the
safety
of
the
settlement
was
seriously
threatened
three
persons
were
killed
in
that
year
in
six
garrisons
were
established
in
different
parts
of
the
town
with
a
small
company
of
soldiers
attached
to
each
two
of
these
houses
are
still
standing
they
were
built
of
brick
two
stories
high
with
a
single
outside
door
so
small
and
narrow
that
but
one
person
could
enter
at
a
time
the
windows
few
and
only
about
two
and
a
half
feet
long
by
eighteen
inches
with
thick
diamond
glass
secured
with
lead
and
crossed
inside
with
bars
of
iron
the
basement
had
but
two
rooms
and
the
chamber
was
entered
by
a
ladder
instead
of
stairs
so
that
the
inmates
if
driven
thither
could
cut
off
communication
with
the
rooms
below
many
private
houses
were
strengthened
and
fortified
we
remember
one
familiar
to
our
boyhood
a
venerable
old
building
of
wood
with
brick
between
the
weather
boards
and
ceiling
with
a
massive
balustrade
over
the
door
constructed
of
oak
timber
and
plank
with
holes
through
the
latter
for
firing
upon
assailants
the
door
opened
upon
a
hall
or
entry
leading
into
the
huge
single
room
of
the
basement
which
was
lighted
by
two
small
windows
the
ceiling
black
with
the
smoke
of
a
century
and
a
half
a
huge
fireplace
calculated
for
wood
occupying
one
entire
side
while
overhead
suspended
from
the
timbers
or
on
shelves
fastened
to
them
were
household
stores
farming
utensils
guns
bunches
of
herbs
gathered
perhaps
a
century
ago
strings
of
dried
apples
and
pumpkins
links
of
mottled
sausages
spareribs
and
flitches
of
bacon
the
firelight
of
an
evening
dimly
revealing
the
checked
woollen
coverlet
of
the
bed
in
one
corner
while
in
another
the
pewter
plates
on
the
dresser
caught
and
reflected
the
flame
as
shields
of
armies
the
sunshine
tradition
has
preserved
many
incidents
of
life
in
the
garrisons
in
times
of
unusual
peril
the
settlers
generally
resorted
at
night
to
the
fortified
houses
taking
thither
their
flocks
and
herds
and
such
household
valuables
as
were
most
likely
to
strike
the
fancy
or
minister
to
the
comfort
or
vanity
of
the
heathen
marauders
false
alarms
were
frequent
the
smoke
of
a
distant
fire
the
bark
of
a
dog
in
the
deep
woods
a
stump
or
bush
taking
in
the
uncertain
light
of
stars
and
moon
the
appearance
of
a
man
were
sufficient
to
spread
alarm
through
the
entire
settlement
and
to
cause
the
armed
men
of
the
garrison
to
pass
whole
nights
in
sleepless
watching
it
is
said
that
at
the
sentinel
on
duty
saw
as
he
thought
an
indian
inside
of
the
paling
which
surrounded
the
building
and
apparently
seeking
to
gain
an
entrance
he
promptly
raised
his
musket
and
fired
at
the
intruder
alarming
thereby
the
entire
garrison
the
women
and
children
left
their
beds
and
the
men
seized
their
guns
and
commenced
firing
on
the
suspicious
object
but
it
seemed
to
bear
a
charmed
life
and
remained
unharmed
as
the
morning
dawned
however
the
mystery
was
solved
by
the
discovery
of
a
black
quilted
petticoat
hanging
on
the
completely
riddled
with
balls
as
a
matter
of
course
under
circumstances
of
perpetual
alarm
and
frequent
peril
the
duty
of
cultivating
their
fields
and
gathering
their
harvests
and
working
at
their
mechanical
avocations
was
dangerous
and
difficult
to
the
settlers
one
instance
will
serve
as
an
illustration
at
the
of
thomas
dustin
the
husband
of
the
mary
dustin
who
while
a
captive
of
the
indians
and
maddened
by
the
murder
of
her
infant
child
killed
and
scalped
with
the
assistance
of
a
young
boy
the
entire
band
of
her
captors
ten
in
number
the
business
of
was
carried
on
the
pits
where
the
clay
was
found
were
only
a
few
rods
from
the
house
yet
no
man
ventured
to
bring
the
clay
to
the
yard
within
the
enclosure
without
the
attendance
of
a
file
of
soldiers
an
anecdote
relating
to
this
garrison
has
been
handed
down
to
the
present
tune
among
its
inmates
were
two
young
cousins
joseph
and
mary
whittaker
the
latter
a
merry
handsome
girl
relieving
the
tedium
of
garrison
duty
with
her
mirthfulness
and
making
a
sunshine
in
that
shady
place
joseph
in
the
intervals
of
his
labors
in
the
double
capacity
of
maker
and
was
assiduous
in
his
attentions
to
his
fair
cousin
who
was
not
inclined
to
encourage
him
growing
desperate
he
threatened
one
evening
to
throw
himself
into
the
garrison
well
his
threat
only
called
forth
the
laughter
of
his
mistress
and
bidding
her
farewell
he
proceeded
to
put
it
in
execution
on
reaching
the
well
he
stumbled
over
a
log
whereupon
animated
by
a
happy
idea
he
dropped
the
wood
into
the
water
instead
of
himself
and
hiding
behind
the
curb
awaited
the
result
mary
who
had
been
listening
at
the
door
and
who
had
not
believed
her
lover
capable
of
so
rash
an
act
heard
the
sudden
plunge
of
the
wooden
joseph
she
ran
to
the
well
and
leaning
over
the
curb
and
peering
down
the
dark
opening
cried
out
in
tones
of
anguish
and
remorse
o
joseph
if
you
in
the
land
of
the
living
i
have
you
i
take
ye
at
your
word
answered
joseph
springing
up
from
his
and
avenging
himself
for
her
coyness
and
coldness
by
a
hearty
embrace
our
own
paternal
ancestor
owing
to
religious
scruples
in
the
matter
of
taking
arms
even
for
defence
of
life
and
property
refused
to
leave
his
undefended
house
and
enter
the
garrison
the
indians
frequently
came
to
his
house
and
the
family
more
than
once
in
the
night
heard
them
whispering
under
the
windows
and
saw
them
put
their
copper
faces
to
the
glass
to
take
a
view
of
the
apartments
strange
as
it
may
seen
they
never
offered
any
injury
or
insult
to
the
inmates
in
the
township
was
many
times
molested
by
indians
and
several
persons
were
killed
and
wounded
early
in
the
fall
a
small
party
made
their
appearance
in
the
northerly
part
of
the
town
where
finding
two
boys
at
work
in
an
open
field
they
managed
to
surprise
and
capture
them
and
without
committing
further
violence
retreated
through
the
woods
to
their
homes
on
the
shore
of
lake
winnipesaukee
isaac
bradley
aged
fifteen
was
a
small
but
active
and
vigorous
boy
his
companion
in
captivity
joseph
whittaker
was
only
eleven
yet
quite
as
large
in
size
and
heavier
in
his
movements
after
a
hard
and
painful
journey
they
arrived
at
the
lake
and
were
placed
in
an
indian
family
consisting
of
a
man
and
squaw
and
two
or
three
children
here
they
soon
acquired
a
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
indian
tongue
to
enable
them
to
learn
from
the
conversation
carried
on
in
their
presence
that
it
was
designed
to
take
them
to
canada
in
the
spring
this
discovery
was
a
painful
one
canada
the
land
of
papist
priests
and
bloody
indians
was
the
especial
terror
of
the
new
england
settlers
and
the
anathema
maranatha
of
puritan
pulpits
thither
the
indians
usually
hurried
their
captives
where
they
compelled
them
to
work
in
their
villages
or
sold
them
to
the
french
planters
escape
from
thence
through
a
deep
wilderness
and
across
lakes
and
mountains
and
almost
impassable
rivers
without
food
or
guide
was
regarded
as
an
impossibility
the
poor
boys
terrified
by
the
prospect
of
being
carried
still
farther
from
their
home
and
friends
began
to
dream
of
escaping
from
their
masters
before
they
started
for
canada
it
was
now
winter
it
would
have
been
little
short
of
madness
to
have
chosen
for
flight
that
season
of
bitter
cold
and
deep
snows
owing
to
exposure
and
want
of
proper
food
and
clothing
isaac
the
eldest
of
the
boys
was
seized
with
a
violent
fever
from
which
he
slowly
recovered
in
the
course
of
the
winter
his
indian
mistress
was
as
kind
to
him
as
her
circumstances
permitted
procuring
medicinal
herbs
and
roots
for
her
patient
and
tenderly
watching
over
him
in
the
long
winter
nights
spring
came
at
length
the
snows
melted
and
the
ice
was
broken
up
on
the
lake
the
indians
began
to
make
preparations
for
journeying
to
canada
and
isaac
who
had
during
his
sickness
devised
a
plan
of
escape
saw
that
the
time
of
putting
it
in
execution
had
come
on
the
evening
before
he
was
to
make
the
attempt
he
for
the
first
time
informed
his
younger
companion
of
his
design
and
told
him
if
he
intended
to
accompany
him
he
must
be
awake
at
the
time
appointed
the
boys
lay
down
as
usual
in
the
wigwam
in
the
midst
of
the
family
joseph
soon
fell
asleep
but
isaac
fully
sensible
of
the
danger
and
difficulty
of
the
enterprise
before
him
lay
awake
watchful
for
his
opportunity
about
midnight
he
rose
cautiously
stepping
over
the
sleeping
forms
of
the
family
and
securing
as
he
went
his
indian
master
flint
steel
and
tinder
and
a
small
quantity
of
dry
and
cornbread
he
then
carefully
awakened
his
companion
who
starting
up
forgetful
of
the
cause
of
his
disturbance
asked
aloud
what
do
you
want
the
savages
began
to
stir
and
isaac
trembling
with
fear
of
detection
lay
down
again
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
after
waiting
a
while
he
again
rose
satisfied
from
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
indians
that
they
were
all
sleeping
and
fearing
to
awaken
joseph
a
second
time
lest
he
should
again
hazard
all
by
his
thoughtlessness
he
crept
softly
out
of
the
wigwam
he
had
proceeded
but
a
few
rods
when
he
heard
footsteps
behind
him
and
supposing
himself
pursued
he
hurried
into
the
woods
casting
a
glance
backward
what
was
his
joy
to
see
his
young
companion
running
after
him
they
hastened
on
in
a
southerly
direction
as
nearly
as
they
could
determine
hoping
to
reach
their
distant
home
when
daylight
appeared
they
found
a
large
hollow
log
into
which
they
crept
for
concealment
wisely
judging
that
they
would
be
hotly
pursued
by
their
indian
captors
their
sagacity
was
by
no
means
at
fault
the
indians
missing
their
prisoners
in
the
morning
started
off
in
pursuit
with
their
dogs
as
the
young
boys
lay
in
the
log
they
could
hear
the
whistle
of
the
indians
and
the
barking
of
dogs
upon
their
track
it
was
a
trying
moment
and
even
the
stout
heart
of
the
elder
boy
sank
within
him
as
the
dogs
came
up
to
the
log
and
set
up
a
loud
bark
of
discovery
but
his
presence
of
mind
saved
him
he
spoke
in
a
low
tone
to
the
dogs
who
recognizing
his
familiar
voice
wagged
their
tails
with
delight
and
ceased
barking
he
then
threw
to
them
the
morsel
of
he
had
taken
from
the
wigwam
while
the
dogs
were
thus
diverted
the
indians
made
their
appearance
the
boys
heard
the
light
stealthy
sound
of
their
moccasins
on
the
leaves
they
passed
close
to
the
log
and
the
dogs
having
devoured
their
meat
trotted
after
their
masters
through
a
crevice
in
the
log
the
boys
looked
after
them
and
saw
them
disappear
in
the
thick
woods
they
remained
in
their
covert
until
night
when
they
started
again
on
their
long
journey
taking
a
new
route
to
avoid
the
indians
at
daybreak
they
again
concealed
themselves
but
travelled
the
next
night
and
day
without
resting
by
this
time
they
had
consumed
all
the
bread
which
they
had
taken
and
were
fainting
from
hunger
and
weariness
just
at
the
close
of
the
third
day
they
were
providentially
enabled
to
kill
a
pigeon
and
a
small
tortoise
a
part
of
which
they
ate
raw
not
daring
to
make
a
fire
which
might
attract
the
watchful
eyes
of
savages
on
the
sixth
day
they
struck
upon
an
old
indian
path
and
following
it
until
night
came
suddenly
upon
a
camp
of
the
enemy
deep
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
under
the
shelter
of
a
ridge
of
land
heavily
timbered
a
great
fire
of
logs
and
brushwood
was
burning
and
around
it
the
indians
sat
eating
their
and
smoking
their
pipes
the
poor
fugitives
starving
weary
and
chilled
by
the
cold
spring
blasts
gazed
down
upon
the
ample
fire
and
the
savory
meats
which
the
squaws
were
cooking
by
it
but
felt
no
temptation
to
purchase
warmth
and
food
by
surrendering
themselves
to
captivity
death
in
the
forest
seemed
preferable
they
turned
and
fled
back
upon
their
track
expecting
every
moment
to
hear
the
yells
of
pursuers
the
morning
found
them
seated
on
the
bank
of
a
small
stream
their
feet
torn
and
bleeding
and
their
bodies
emaciated
the
elder
as
a
last
effort
made
search
for
roots
and
fortunately
discovered
a
few
glicine
apios
which
served
to
refresh
in
some
degree
himself
and
his
still
weaker
companion
as
they
stood
together
by
the
stream
hesitating
and
almost
despairing
it
occurred
to
isaac
that
the
rivulet
might
lead
to
a
larger
stream
of
water
and
that
to
the
sea
and
the
white
settlements
near
it
and
he
resolved
to
follow
it
they
again
began
their
painful
march
the
day
passed
and
the
night
once
more
overtook
them
when
the
eighth
morning
dawned
the
younger
of
the
boys
found
himself
unable
to
rise
from
his
bed
of
leaves
isaac
endeavored
to
encourage
him
dug
roots
and
procured
water
for
him
but
the
poor
lad
was
utterly
exhausted
he
had
no
longer
heart
or
hope
the
elder
boy
laid
him
on
leaves
and
dry
grass
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
and
with
a
heavy
heart
bade
him
farewell
alone
he
slowly
and
painfully
proceeded
down
the
stream
now
greatly
increased
in
size
by
tributary
rivulets
on
the
top
of
a
hill
he
climbed
with
difficulty
into
a
tree
and
saw
in
the
distance
what
seemed
to
be
a
clearing
and
a
newly
raised
frame
building
hopeful
and
rejoicing
he
turned
back
to
his
young
companion
told
him
what
he
had
seen
and
after
chafing
his
limbs
awhile
got
him
upon
his
feet
sometimes
supporting
him
and
at
others
carrying
him
on
his
back
the
heroic
boy
staggered
towards
the
clearing
on
reaching
it
he
found
it
deserted
and
was
obliged
to
continue
his
journey
towards
night
signs
of
civilization
began
to
appear
the
heavy
continuous
roar
of
water
was
heard
and
presently
emerging
from
the
forest
he
saw
a
great
river
dashing
in
white
foam
down
precipitous
rocks
and
on
its
bank
the
gray
walls
of
a
huge
stone
building
with
flankers
palisades
and
moat
over
which
the
british
flag
was
flying
this
was
the
famous
saco
fort
built
by
governor
phips
two
years
before
just
below
the
falls
of
the
saco
river
the
soldiers
of
the
garrison
gave
the
poor
fellows
a
kindly
welcome
joseph
who
was
scarcely
alive
lay
for
a
long
time
sick
in
the
fort
but
isaac
soon
regained
his
strength
and
set
out
for
his
home
in
haverhill
which
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
arrive
at
in
safety
amidst
the
stirring
excitements
of
the
present
day
when
every
thrill
of
the
electric
wire
conveys
a
new
subject
for
thought
or
action
to
a
generation
as
eager
as
the
ancient
athenians
for
some
new
thing
simple
legends
of
the
past
like
that
which
we
have
transcribed
have
undoubtedly
lost
in
a
great
degree
their
interest
the
lore
of
the
fireside
is
becoming
obsolete
and
with
the
octogenarian
few
who
still
linger
among
us
will
perish
the
unwritten
history
of
border
life
in
new
england
the
black
men
in
the
revolution
and
war
of
the
return
of
the
festival
of
our
national
independence
has
called
our
attention
to
a
matter
which
has
been
very
carefully
kept
out
of
sight
by
orators
and
we
allude
to
the
participation
of
colored
men
in
the
great
struggle
for
american
freedom
it
is
not
in
accordance
with
our
taste
or
our
principles
to
eulogize
the
shedders
of
blood
even
in
a
cause
of
acknowledged
justice
but
when
we
see
a
whole
nation
doing
honor
to
the
memories
of
one
class
of
its
defenders
to
the
total
neglect
of
another
class
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
of
darker
complexion
we
can
not
forego
the
satisfaction
of
inviting
notice
to
certain
historical
facts
which
for
the
last
half
century
have
been
quietly
elbowed
aside
as
no
more
deserving
of
a
place
in
patriotic
recollection
than
the
descendants
of
the
men
to
whom
the
facts
in
question
relate
have
to
a
place
in
a
fourth
of
july
procession
of
the
services
and
sufferings
of
the
colored
soldiers
of
the
revolution
no
attempt
has
to
our
knowledge
been
made
to
preserve
a
record
they
have
had
no
historian
with
here
and
there
an
exception
they
have
all
passed
away
and
only
some
faint
tradition
of
their
campaigns
under
washington
and
greene
and
lafayette
and
of
their
cruisings
under
decatur
and
barry
lingers
among
their
descendants
yet
enough
is
known
to
show
that
the
free
colored
men
of
the
united
states
bore
their
full
proportion
of
the
sacrifices
and
trials
of
the
revolutionary
war
the
late
governor
eustis
of
massachusetts
the
pride
and
boast
of
the

was
instrumental
in
securing

of
the
pensions
of
nineteen
colored
soldiers
i
can
not
he
says
refrain
from
mentioning
one
aged
black
man
primus
babcock
who
proudly
presented
to
me
an
honorable
discharge
from
service
during
the
war
dated
at
the
close
of
it
wholly
in
the
handwriting
of
george
washington
nor
can
i
forget
the
expression
of
his
feelings
when
informed
after
his
discharge
had
been
sent
to
the
war
department
that
it
could
not
be
returned
at
his
request
it
was
written
for
as
he
seemed
inclined
to
spurn
the
pension
and
reclaim
the
discharge
there
is
a
touching
anecdote
related
of
baron
stenben
on
the
occasion
of
the
disbandment
of
the
american
army
a
black
soldier
with
his
wounds
unhealed
utterly
destitute
stood
on
the
wharf
just
as
a
vessel
bound
for
his
distant
home
was
getting
under
way
the
poor
fellow
gazed
at
the
vessel
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
gave
himself
up
to
despair
the
foreigner
witnessed
his
emotion
and
inquiring
into
the
cause
of
it
took
his
last
dollar
from
his
purse
and
gave
it
to
him
with
tears
of
sympathy
trickling
down
his
cheeks
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
the
poor
wounded
soldier
hailed
the
sloop
and
was
received
on
board
as
it
moved
out
from
the
wharf
he
cried
back
to
his
noble
friend
on
shore
god
almighty
bless
you
master
baron
in
rhode
island
says
governor
eustis
in
his
able
speech
against
slavery
in
missouri
of
twelfth
month
the
blacks
formed
an
entire
regiment
and
they
discharged
their
duty
with
zeal
and
fidelity
the
gallant
defence
of
red
bank
in
which
the
black
regiment
bore
a
part
is
among
the
proofs
of
their
valor
in
this
contest
it
will
be
recollected
that
four
hundred
men
met
and
repulsed
after
a
terrible
and
sanguinary
struggle
fifteen
hundred
hessian
troops
headed
by
count
donop
the
glory
of
the
defence
of
red
bank
which
has
been
pronounced
one
of
the
most
heroic
actions
of
the
war
belongs
in
reality
to
black
men
yet
who
now
hears
them
spoken
of
in
connection
with
it
among
the
traits
which
distinguished
the
black
regiment
was
devotion
to
their
officers
in
the
attack
made
upon
the
american
lines
near
croton
river
on
the
of
the
fifth
month
colonel
greene
the
commander
of
the
regiment
was
cut
down
and
mortally
wounded
but
the
sabres
of
the
enemy
only
reached
him
through
the
bodies
of
his
faithful
guard
of
blacks
who
hovered
over
him
to
protect
him
every
one
of
whom
was
killed
the

a
revolutionary
veteran

in

speech
at

new

some
years
ago
that
on
one
occasion
the
regiment
to
which
he
was
attached
was
commanded
to
defend
an
important
position
which
the
enemy
thrice
assailed
and
from
which
they
were
as
often
repulsed
there
was
said
the
venerable
speaker
a
regiment
of
blacks
in
the
same
situation
a
regiment
of
negroes
fighting
for
our
liberty
and
independence
not
a
white
man
among
them
but
the
officers
in
the
same
dangerous
and
responsible
position
had
they
been
unfaithful
or
given
way
before
the
enemy
all
would
have
been
lost
three
times
in
succession
were
they
attacked
with
most
desperate
fury
by
disciplined
and
veteran
troops
and
three
times
did
they
successfully
repel
the
assault
and
thus
preserve
an
army
they
fought
thus
through
the
war

enter

of
a
law

which
on
condition
of
their
serving
in
the
ranks
during
the
war
they
were
made
freemen
this
hope
of
liberty
inspired
them
with
courage
to
oppose
their

that
they
were
on
the
point

shrewdly
suggested
that
it
would
be
a
great
satisfaction

his
liberty

in

immortality

numerous

of
them
were

whites
at
the
battles
of

let
us
now
look
forward
thirty
or
forty
years
to
the
last
war
with
great
britain
and
see
whether
the
whites
enjoyed
a
monopoly
of
patriotism
at
that
time
martindale

of

month
said
slaves
or
negroes
who
had
been
slaves
were
enlisted
as
soldiers
in
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
i
myself
saw
a
battalion
of
them
as
fine
men
as
i
ever
saw
attached
to
the
northern
army
in
the
last

large
numbers
of
them
were
with
perry
and
helped
to
gain
the
brilliant
victory
of
lake

a
whole
battalion
of
them
were
distinguished
for
their
orderly
appearance
clarke
in
the
convention
which
revised
the
constitution
of
new
york
in
speaking
of
the
colored
inhabitants
of
the
state
said
in
your
late
war
they
contributed
largely
towards
some
of
your
most
splendid
victories
on
lakes
erie
and
champlain
where
your
fleets
triumphed
over
a
foe
superior
in
numbers
and
engines
of
death
they
were
manned
in
a
large
proportion
with
men
of
color
and
in
this
very
house
in
the
fall
of
a
bill
passed
receiving
the
approbation
of
all
the
branches
of
your
government
authorizing
the
governor
to
accept
the
services
of
a
corps
of
two
thousand
free
people
of
color
sir
these
were
times
which
tried
men
souls
in
these
times
it
was
no
sporting
matter
to
bear
arms
these
were
times
when
a
man
who
shouldered
his
musket
did
not
know
but
he
bared
his
bosom
to
receive
a
from
the
enemy
ere
he
laid
it
aside
and
in
these
times
these
people
were
found
as
ready
and
as
willing
to
volunteer
in
your
service
as
any
other
they
were
not
compelled
to
go
they
were
not
drafted
no
your
pride
had
placed
them
beyond
your
compulsory
power
but
there
was
no
necessity
for
its
exercise
they
were
volunteers
yes
sir
volunteers
to
defend
that
very
country
from
the
inroads
and
ravages
of
a
ruthless
and
vindictive
foe
which
had
treated
them
with
insult
degradation
and
slavery
on
the
capture
of
washington
by
the
british
forces
it
was
judged
expedient
to
fortify
without
delay
the
principal
towns
and
cities
exposed
to
similar
attacks
the
vigilance
committee
of
philadelphia
waited
upon
three
of
the
principal
colored
citizens
namely
james
forten
bishop
allen
and
absalom
jones
soliciting
the
aid
of
the
people
of
color
in
erecting
suitable
defences
for
the
city
accordingly
hundred
colored
then
assembled
in
the
yard
and
from
thence
marched
to
gray
ferry
where
they
labored
for
two
days
almost
without
intermission
their
labors
were
so
faithful
and
efficient
that
a
vote
of
thanks
was
tendered
them
by
the
committee
a
battalion
of
colored
troops
was
at
the
same
time
organized
in
the
city
under
an
officer
of
the
united
states
army
and
they
were
on
the
point
of
marching
to
the
frontier
when
peace
was
proclaimed
general
jackson
proclamations
to
the
free
colored
inhabitants
of
louisiana
are
well
known
in
his
first
inviting
them
to
take
up
arms
he
said
as
sons
of
freedom
you
are
now
called
on
to
defend
our
most
inestimable
blessings
as
americans
your
country
looks
with
confidence
to
her
adopted
children
for
a
valorous
support
as
fathers
husbands
and
brothers
you
are
summoned
to
rally
round
the
standard
of
the
eagle
to
defend
all
which
is
dear
in
existence
the
second
proclamation
is
one
of
the
highest
compliments
ever
paid
by
a
military
chief
to
his
soldiers
to
the
free
people
of
color
soldiers
when
on
the
banks
of
the
mobile
i
called
you
to
take
up
arms
inviting
you
to
partake
the
perils
and
glory
of
your
white
citizens
i
expected
much
from
you
for
i
was
not
ignorant
that
you
possessed
qualities
most
formidable
to
an
invading
enemy
i
knew
with
what
fortitude
you
could
endure
hunger
and
thirst
and
all
the
fatigues
of
a
campaign
i
knew
well
how
you
loved
your
native
country
and
that
you
as
well
as
ourselves
had
to
defend
what
man
holds
most
dear
his
parents
wife
children
and
property
you
have
done
more
than
i
expected
in
addition
to
the
previous
qualities
i
before
knew
you
to
possess
i
found
among
you
a
noble
enthusiasm
which
leads
to
the
performance
of
great
things
soldiers
the
president
of
the
united
states
shall
hear
how
praiseworthy
was
your
conduct
in
the
hour
of
danger
and
the
representatives
of
the
american
people
will
give
you
the
praise
your
exploits
entitle
you
to
your
general
anticipates
them
in
applauding
your
noble
ardor
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
whatever
honor
belongs
to
the
heroes
of
the
revolution
and
the
volunteers
in
the
second
war
for
independence
is
to
be
divided
between
the
white
and
the
colored
man
we
have
dwelt
upon
this
subject
at
length
not
because
it
accords
with
our
principles
or
feelings
for
it
is
scarcely
necessary
for
us
to
say
that
we
are
one
of
those
who
hold
that
peace
hath
her
victories
no
less
renowned
than
war
and
certainly
far
more
desirable
and
useful
but
because
in
popular
estimation
the
patriotism
which
dares
and
does
on
the
takes
a
higher
place
than
the
quiet
exercise
of
the
duties
of
peaceful
citizenship
and
we
are
willing
that
colored
soldiers
with
their
descendants
should
have
the
benefit
if
possible
of
a
public
sentiment
which
has
so
extravagantly
lauded
their
white
companions
in
arms
if
pulpits
must
be
desecrated
by
eulogies
of
the
patriotism
of
bloodshed
we
see
no
reason
why
black
defenders
of
their
country
in
the
war
for
liberty
should
not
receive
honorable
mention
as
well
as
white
invaders
of
a
neighboring
republic
who
have
volunteered
in
a
war
for
plunder
and
slavery
extension
for
the
latter
class
of
heroes
we
have
very
little
respect
the
patriotism
of
too
many
of
them
forcibly
reminds
us
of
johnson
definition
of
that
term
patriotism
sir
is
the
last
refuge
of
a
scoundrel
what
right
i
demand
said
an
american
orator
some
years
ago
have
the
children
of
africa
to
a
homestead
in
the
white
man
country
the
answer
will
in
part
be
found
in
the
facts
which
we
have
presented
their
right
like
that
of
their
white
dates
back
to
the
dread
arbitrament
of
battle
their
bones
whiten

stricken

of
the
revolution
their
feet
tracked
with
blood
the
snows
of

their
toil
built
up
every
fortification

of

potomac
they
shared
the
famine
and
nakedness
of

forge
and
the
pestilential
horrors
of
the
old

prisonship
have
they
then
no
claim
to
an
equal
participation
in
the
blessings
which
have
grown
out
of
the
national
independence
for
which
they
fought
is
it
just
is
it
magnanimous
is
it
safe
even
to
starve
the
patriotism
of
such
a
people
to
cast
their
hearts
out
of
the
treasury
of
the
republic
and
to
convert
them
by
political
disfranchisement
and

oppression

for

soon
after

then
has
been

crime

not
the
giving
away
to
another

my
crime
is
for
having
dared
to

according
to
the
measure
of
my
feeble
abilities
a
strenuous
and
an
active
advocate
for
an
equal
representation
of
the
people
in
the
house
of
the
people
for
having
dared
to
accomplish
a
measure
by

diminish

to
put

words
were

down
by

spot
there
is
nothing
in

supplication
unless
it
be
that
of
sir
henry
vane
a
kindred
martyr
at

foot
of

scaffold
just
before

execution
it
is
the
prayer
of
universal
humanity
which
god
will
yet
hear
and
answer
o
thou
governor
of
the
universe
we
rejoice
that
at
all
times
and
in
all
circumstances
we
have
liberty
to
approach
thy
throne
and
that
we
are
assured
that
no
sacrifice
is
more
acceptable
to
thee
than
that
which
is
made
for
the
relief
of
the
oppressed
in
this
moment
of
trial
and
persecution
we
pray
that
thou
wouldst
be
our
defender
our
counsellor
and
our
guide
oh
be
thou
a
pillar
of
fire
to
us
as
thou
wast
to
our
fathers
of
old
to
enlighten
and
direct
us
and
to
our
enemies
a
pillar
of
cloud
and
darkness
and
confusion
thou
art
thyself
the
great
patron
of
liberty
thy
service
is
perfect
freedom
prosper
we
beseech
thee
every
endeavor
which
we
make
to
promote
thy
cause
for
we
consider
the
cause
of
truth
or
every
cause
which
tends
to
promote
the
happiness
of
thy
creatures
as
thy
cause
o
thou
merciful
father
of
mankind
enable
us
for
thy
name
sake
to
endure
persecution
with
fortitude
and
may
we
believe
that
all
trials
and
tribulations
of
life
which
we
endure
shall
work
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
thee
and
grant
that
the
greater
the
evil
and
the
longer
it
may
be
continued
the
greater
good
in
thy
holy
and
adorable
providence
may
be
produced
therefrom
and
this
we
beg
not
for
our
own
merits
but
through
the
merits
of
him
who
is
hereafter
to
judge
the
world
in
righteousness
and
mercy
he
ceased
and
the
sheriff
who
had
been
temporarily
overawed
by
the
extraordinary
scene
enforced
the
warrant
and
the
meeting
was
broken
up
the
delegates
descended
to
the
street
in
silence
arthur
seat
and
salisbury
crags
glooming
in
the
distance
and
night
an
immense
and
agitated
multitude
waiting
around
over
which
tossed
the
flaring
flambeaux
of
the
sheriff
train
gerrald
who
was
already
under
arrest
as
he
descended
spoke
aloud
behold
the
funeral
torches
of
liberty
skirving
and
several
others
were
immediately
arrested
they
were
tried
in
the
first
month
and
sentenced
as
muir
and
palmer
had
previously
been
to
transportation
their
conduct
throughout
was
worthy
of
their
great
and
holy
cause
gerrald
defence
was
that
of
freedom
rather
than
his
own
forgetting
himself
he
spoke
out
manfully
and
earnestly
for
the
poor
the
oppressed
the
overtaxed
and
starving
millions
of
his
countrymen
that
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
this
noble
plea
for
liberty
i
give
an
extract
from
the
concluding
paragraphs
true
religion
like
all
free
governments
appeals
to
the
understanding
for
its
support
and
not
to
the
sword
all
systems
whether
civil
or
moral
can
only
be
durable
in
proportion
as
they
are
founded
on
truth
and
calculated
to
promote
the
good
of
mankind
this
will
account
to
us
why
governments
suited
to
the
great
energies
of
man
have
always
outlived
the
perishable
things
which
despotism
has
erected
yes
this
will
account
to
us
why
the
stream
of
time
which
is
continually
washing
away
the
dissoluble
fabrics
of
superstitions
and
impostures
passes
without
injury
by
the
adamant
of
christianity
those
who
are
versed
in
the
history
of
their
country
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
must
know
that
rigorous
state
prosecutions
have
always
preceded
the
era
of
convulsion
and
this
era
i
fear
will
be
accelerated
by
the
folly
and
madness
of
our
rulers
if
the
people
are
discontented
the
proper
mode
of
quieting
their
discontent
is
not
by
instituting
rigorous
and
sanguinary
prosecutions
but
by
redressing
their
wrongs
and
conciliating
their
affections
courts
of
justice
indeed
may
be
called
in
to
the
aid
of
ministerial
vengeance
but
if
once
the
purity
of
their
proceedings
is
suspected
they
will
cease
to
be
objects
of
reverence
to
the
nation
they
will
degenerate
into
empty
and
expensive
pageantry
and
become
the
partial
instruments
of
vexatious
oppression
whatever
may
become
of
me
my
principles
will
last
forever
individuals
may
perish
but
truth
is
eternal
the
rude
blasts
of
tyranny
may
blow
from
every
quarter
but
freedom
is
that
hardy
plant
which
will
survive
the
tempest
and
strike
an
everlasting
root
into
the
most
unfavorable
soil
gentlemen
i
am
in
your
hands
about
my
life
i
feel
not
the
slightest
anxiety
if
it
would
promote
the
cause
i
would
cheerfully
make
the
sacrifice
for
if
i
perish
on
an
occasion
like
the
present
out
of
my
ashes
will
arise
a
flame
to
consume
the
tyrants
and
oppressors
of
my
country
years
have
passed
and
the
generation
which
knew
the
persecuted
reformers
has
given
place
to
another
and
now
half
a
century
after
william
skirving
as
he
rose
to
receive
his
sentence
declared
to
his
judges
you
may
condemn
us
as
felons
but
your
sentence
shall
yet
be
reversed
by
the
people
the
names
of
these
men
are
once
more
familiar
to
british
lips
the
sentence
has
been
reversed
the
prophecy
of
skirving
has
become
history
on
the
of
the
eighth
month
the
of
a
monument
to
the
memory
of
the
scottish
martyrs
for
which
subscriptions
had
been
received
from
such
men
as
lord
holland
the
dukes
of
bedford
and
norfolk
and
the
earls
of
essex
and
leicester
was
laid
with
imposing
ceremonies
in
the
beautiful
of
calton
hill
edinburgh
by
the
veteran
reformer
and
tribune
of
the
people
joseph
hume
after
delivering
an
appropriate
address
the
aged
radical
closed
the
impressive
scene
by
reading
the
prayer
of
joseph
gerrald
at
the
banquet
which
afterwards
took
place
and
which
was
presided
over
by
john
dunlop
addresses
were
made
by
the
president
and
ritchie
and
by
william
skirving
of
kirkaldy
son
of
the
martyr
the
complete
suffrage
association
of
edinburgh
to
the
number
of
five
hundred
walked
in
procession
to
calton
hill
and
in
the
open
air
proclaimed
unmolested
the
very
principles
for
which
the
martyrs
of
the
past
century
had
suffered
the
account
of
this
tribute
to
the
memory
of
departed
worth
can
not
fail
to
awaken
in
generous
hearts
emotions
of
gratitude
towards
him
who
has
thus
signally
vindicated
his
truth
showing
that
the
triumph
of
the
oppressor
is
but
for
a
season
and
that
even
in
this
world
a
lie
can
not
live
forever
well
and
truly
did
george
fox
say
in
his
last
days
the
truth
is
above
all
will
it
be
said
however
that
this
tribute
comes
too
late
that
it
can
not
solace
those
brave
hearts
which
slowly
broken
by
the
long
agony
of
colonial
servitude
are
now
cold
in
strange
graves
it
is
indeed
a
striking
illustration
of
the
truth
that
he
who
would
benefit
his
man
must
walk
by
faith
sowing
his
seed
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
withholding
not
his
hand
knowing
only
this
that
in
god
good
time
the
harvest
shall
spring
up
and
ripen
if
not
for
himself
yet
for
others
who
as
they
bind
the
full
sheaves
and
gather
in
the
heavy
clusters
may
perchance
remember
him
with
gratitude
and
set
up
stones
of
memorial
on
the
fields
of
his
toil
and
sacrifices
we
may
regret
that
in
this
stage
of
the
spirit
life
the
sincere
and
worker
is
not
always
permitted
to
partake
of
the
fruits
of
his
toil
or
receive
the
honors
of
a
benefactor
we
hear
his
good
evil
spoken
of
and
his
noblest
sacrifices
counted
as
naught
we
see
him
not
only
assailed
by
the
wicked
but
discountenanced
and
shunned
by
the
timidly
good
followed
on
his
hot
and
dusty
pathway
by
the
execrations
of
the
hounding
mob
and
the
contemptuous
pity
of
the
worldly
wise
and
prudent
and
when
at
last
the
horizon
of
time
shuts
down
between
him
and
ourselves
and
the
places
which
have
known
him
know
him
no
more
forever
we
are
almost
ready
to
say
with
the
regal
voluptuary
of
old
this
also
is
vanity
and
a
great
evil
for
what
hath
a
man
of
all
his
labor
and
of
the
vexation
of
his
heart
wherein
he
hath
labored
under
the
sun
but
is
this
the
end
has
universe
no
wider
limits
than
the
circle
of
the
blue
wall
which
shuts
in
our
has
life
infancy
only
been
provided
for
and
beyond
this
poor
of
time
is
there
no
playground
for
the
soul
youth
no
broad
fields
for
its
manhood
perchance
could
we
but
lift
the
curtains
of
the
narrow
pinfold
wherein
we
dwell
we
might
see
that
our
poor
friend
and
brother
whose
fate
we
have
thus
deplored
has
by
no
means
lost
the
reward
of
his
labors
but
that
in
new
fields
of
duty
he
is
cheered
even
by
the
tardy
recognition
of
the
value
of
his
services
in
the
old
the
continuity
of
life
is
never
broken
the
river
flows
onward
and
is
lost
to
our
sight
but
under
its
new
horizon
it
carries
the
same
waters
which
it
gathered
under
ours
and
its
unseen
valleys
are
made
glad
by
the
offerings
which
are
borne
down
to
them
from
the
past
flowers
perchance
the
germs
of
which
its
own
waves
had
planted
on
the
banks
of
time
who
shall
say
that
the
mournful
and
repentant
love
with
which
the
benefactors
of
our
race
are
at
length
regarded
may
not
be
to
them
in
their
new
condition
of
being
sweet
and
grateful
as
the
perfume
of
forgotten
flowers
or
that
our
of
rejoicing
may
not
reach
the
ears
of
those
who
in
weakness
and
suffering
scattered
the
seeds
of
blessing
the
history
of
the
edinburgh
reformers
is
no
new
one
it
is
that
of
all
who
seek
to
benefit
their
age
by
rebuking
its
popular
crimes
and
exposing
its
cherished
errors
the
truths
which
they
told
were
not
believed
and
for
that
very
reason
were
the
more
needed
for
it
is
evermore
the
case
that
the
right
word
when
first
uttered
is
an
unpopular
and
denied
one
hence
he
who
undertakes
to
tread
the
thorny
pathway
of
reform
who
smitten
with
the
love
of
truth
and
justice
or
indignant
in
view
of
wrong
and
insolent
oppression
is
rashly
inclined
to
throw
himself
at
once
into
that
great
conflict
which
the
persian
seer
not
untruly
represented
as
a
war
between
light
and
darkness
would
do
well
to
count
the
cost
in
the
outset
if
he
can
live
for
truth
alone
and
cut
off
from
the
general
sympathy
regard
her
service
as
its
own
exceeding
great
reward
if
he
can
bear
to
be
counted
a
fanatic
and
crazy
visionary
if
in
all
good
nature
he
is
ready
to
receive
from
the
very
objects
of
his
solicitude
abuse
and
obloquy
in
return
for
disinterested
and
efforts
for
their
welfare
if
with
his
purest
motives
misunderstood
and
his
best
actions
perverted
and
distorted
into
crimes
he
can
still
hold
on
his
way
and
patiently
abide
the
hour
when
the
whirligig
of
time
shall
bring
about
its
revenges
if
on
the
whole
he
is
prepared
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
sort
of
moral
outlaw
or
social
heretic
under
good
interdict
of
food
and
fire
and
if
he
is
well
assured
that
he
can
through
all
this
preserve
his
cheerfulness
and
faith
in
man
let
him
gird
up
his
loins
and
go
forward
in
god
name
he
is
fitted
for
his
vocation
he
has
watched
all
night
by
his
armor
whatever
his
trial
may
be
he
is
prepared
he
may
even
be
happily
disappointed
in
respect
to
it
flowers
of
unexpected
refreshing
may
overhang
the
hedges
of
his
strait
and
narrow
way
but
it
remains
to
be
true
that
he
who
serves
his
contemporaries
in
faithfulness
and
sincerity
must
expect
no
wages
from
their
gratitude
for
as
has
been
well
said
there
is
after
all
but
one
way
of
doing
the
world
good
and
unhappily
that
way
the
world
does
not
like
for
it
consists
in
telling
it
the
very
thing
which
it
does
not
wish
to
hear
unhappily
in
the
case
of
the
reformer
his
most
dangerous
foes
are
those
of
his
own
household
true
the
world
garden
has
become
a
desert
and
needs
renovation
but
is
his
own
little
nook
weedless
sin
abounds
without
but
is
his
own
heart
pure
while
smiting
down
the
giants
and
dragons
which
beset
the
outward
world
are
there
no
evil
guests
sitting
by
his
own
ambition
envy
impatience
dogmatism
and
pride
of
opinion
stand
at
his
ready
to
enter
whenever
he
leaves
it
unguarded
then
too
there
is
no
small
danger
of
failing
to
discriminate
between
a
rational
philanthropy
with
its
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
and
that
spiritual
which
undertakes
the
championship
of
every
novel
project
of
reform
scouring
the
world
in
search
of
distressed
schemes
held
in
durance
by
common
sense
and
vagaries
happily
spellbound
by
ridicule
he
must
learn
that
although
the
most
needful
truth
may
be
unpopular
it
does
not
follow
that
unpopularity
is
a
proof
of
the
truth
of
his
doctrines
or
the
expediency
of
his
measures
he
must
have
the
liberality
to
admit
that
it
is
barely
possible
for
the
public
on
some
points
to
be
right
and
himself
wrong
and
that
the
blessing
invoked
upon
those
who
suffer
for
righteousness
is
not
available
to
such
as
court
persecution
and
invite
contempt
for
folly
has
its
martyrs
as
well
as
wisdom
and
he
who
has
nothing
better
to
show
of
himself
than
the
scars
and
bruises
which
the
popular
foot
has
left
upon
him
is
not
even
sure
of
winning
the
honors
of
martyrdom
as
some
compensation
for
the
loss
of
dignity
and
involved
in
the
exhibition
of
its
pains
to
the
reformer
in
an
especial
manner
comes
home
the
truth
that
whoso
ruleth
his
own
spirit
is
greater
than
he
who
taketh
a
city
patience
hope
charity
watchfulness
unto
prayer
how
needful
are
all
these
to
his
success
without
them
he
is
in
danger
of
ingloriously
giving
up
his
contest
with
error
and
prejudice
at
the
first
repulse
or
with
that
spiteful
philanthropy
which
we
sometimes
witness
taking
a
sick
world
by
the
nose
like
a
spoiled
child
and
endeavoring
to
force
down
its
throat
the
nostrums
prepared
for
its
relief
what
then
shall
we
in
view
of
these
things
call
back
young
generous
spirits
just
entering
upon
the
perilous
pathway
god
forbid
welcome
thrice
welcome
rather
let
them
go
forward
not
unwarned
of
the
dangers
nor
unreminded
of
the
pleasures
which
belong
to
the
service
of
humanity
great
is
the
consciousness
of
right
sweet
is
the
answer
of
a
good
conscience
he
who
pays
his
homage
to
truth
and
duty
who
swears
his
lifelong
fealty
on
their
altars
and
rises
up
a
nazarite
consecrated
to
their
holy
service
is
not
without
his
solace
and
enjoyment
when
to
the
eyes
of
others
he
seems
the
most
lonely
and
miserable
he
breathes
an
atmosphere
which
the
multitude
know
not
of
a
serene
heaven
which
they
can
not
discern
rests
over
him
glorious
in
its
purity
and
stillness
nor
is
he
altogether
without
kindly
human
sympathies
all
generous
and
earnest
hearts
which
are
brought
in
contact
with
his
own
beat
evenly
with
it
all
that
is
good
and
truthful
and
lovely
in
man
whenever
and
wherever
it
truly
recognizes
him
must
sooner
or
later
acknowledge
his
claim
to
love
and
reverence
his
faith
overcomes
all
things
the
future
unrolls
itself
before
him
with
its
waving
springing
up
from
the
seed
he
is
scattering
and
he
looks
forward
to
the
close
of
life
with
the
calm
confidence
of
one
who
feels
that
he
has
not
lived
idle
and
useless
but
with
hopeful
heart
and
strong
arm
has
labored
with
god
and
nature
for
the
best
and
not
in
vain
in
the
economy
of

no
effort
however
small
put
forth
for
the
right
cause
fails
of
its
effect
no
voice
however
feeble
lifted
up
for
truth
ever
dies
amidst
the
confused
noises
of
time
through
discords
of
sin
and
sorrow
pain
and
wrong
it
rises
a
deathless
melody
whose
notes
of
wailing
are
hereafter
to
be
changed
to
those
of
triumph
as
they
blend
with
the
great
harmony
of
a
reconciled
universe
the
language
of
a
transatlantic
reformer
to
his
friends
is
then
as
true
as
it
is
hopeful
and
cheering
triumph
is
certain
we
have
espoused
no
losing
cause
in
the
body
we
may
not
join
our
shout
with
the
victors
but
in
spirit
we
may
even
now
there
is
but
an
interval
of
time
between
us
and
the
success
at
which
we
aim
in
all
other
respects
the
links
of
the
chain
are
complete
identifying
ourselves
with
immortal
and
immutable
principles
we
share
both
their
immortality
and
immutability
the
vow
which
unites
us
with
truth
makes
futurity
present
with
us
our
being
resolves
itself
into
an
everlasting
now
it
is
not
so
correct
to
say
that
we
shall
be
victorious
as
that
we
are
so
when
we
will
in
unison
with
the

the

some
sort
those
of

what
he
has
willed
is
virtually
done
it
may
take
ages
to
unfold
itself
but
the
germ
of
its
whole
history
is
wrapped
up
in
his
determination
when
we
make
his
will
ours
which
we
do
when
we
aim
at
truth
that
upon
which
we
are
resolved
is
done
decided
born
life
is
in
it
it
is
and
the

the

ours
therefore
is
a

triumph
our
deeds
are

a

is

they

if

it

denied
that
some
very
satisfactory
steps
have
been
taken
in
the

direction
at
least
since
the
days
of
the

our
age
is
tolerant
of
creed
and

broader
in

more
keenly
sensitive

temporal
need
and
practically
recognizing
the
brotherhood
of
the

wherever
a
cry
of
suffering
is
heard
its

is
quick

generous
it
has
abolished

is
lifting
woman
from

an

for

to

we

the
old
puritan

quaker
hatred
of

with
our
just
tolerance
of

a
righteous
abhorrence
of

all
the
more
for
the

we
need
the
bracing
atmosphere
healthful
if
austere
of
the
old
moralities
individual
and
social
duties
are
quite
as
imperative
now
as
when
they
were
minutely
specified
in
and
enforced
by
penalties
no

admissible
it
is
well
that

matters
of

but
the
honest
reprobation
of

which
they
symbolized
should
by
no

perish
with
them
the

of

is

of
others
are
all
well
but
truth
honor
reverence
and
fidelity
to
duty
are
indispensable
the
pilgrims
were
right
in
affirming
the
paramount
authority
of
the
law
of
god
if
they
erred
in
seeking
that
authoritative
law
and
passed
over
the
sermon
on
the
mount
for
the
stern
hebraisms
of
moses
if
they
hesitated
in
view
of
the
largeness
of
christian
liberty
if
they
seemed
unwilling
to
accept
the
sweetness
and
light
of
the
good
tidings
let
us
not
forget
that
it
was
the
mistake
of
men
who
feared
more
than
they
dared
to
hope
whose
estimate
of
the
exceeding
awfulness
of
sin
caused
them
to
dwell
upon
god
vengeance
rather
than
his
compassion
and
whose
dread
of
evil
was
so
great
that
in
shutting
their
hearts
against
it
they
sometimes
shut
out
the
good
it
is
well
for
us
if
we
have
learned
to
listen
to
the
sweet
persuasion
of
the
beatitudes
but
there
are
crises
in
all
lives
which
require
also
the
emphatic
thou
shalt
not
or
the
decalogue
which
the
founders
wrote
on
the
of
their
commonwealth
let
us
then
be
thankful
for
the
assurances
which
the
last
few
years
have
afforded
us
that
the
pilgrim
spirit
is
not
dead
but
walks
in
noon
broad
light
we
have
seen
it
in
the
faith
and
trust
which
no
circumstances
could
shake
in
heroic
in
entire
consecration
to
duty
the
fathers
have
lived
in
their
sons
have
we
not
all
known
the
winthrops
and
brewsters
the
saltonstalls
and
sewalls
of
old
times
in
gubernatorial
chairs
in
legislative
halls
around
winter
in
the
slow
martyrdoms
of
prison
and
hospital
the
great
struggle
through
which
we
have
passed
has
taught
us
how
much
we
owe
to
the
men
and
women
of
the
plymouth
colony
the
noblest
ancestry
that
ever
a
people
looked
back
to
with
love
and
reverence
honor
then
to
the
pilgrims
let
their
memory
be
green
forever
governor
endicott
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
respond
in
person
to
the
invitation
of
the
essex
institute
to
its
commemorative
festival
on
the
i
especially
regret
it
because
though
a
member
of
the
society
of
friends
and
as
such
regarding
with
abhorrence
the
severe
persecution
of
the
sect
under
the
administration
of
governor
endicott
i
am
not
unmindful
of
the
otherwise
noble
qualities
and
worthy
record
of
the
great
puritan
whose
misfortune
it
was
to
live
in
an
age
which
regarded
religious
toleration
as
a
crime
he
was
the
victim
of
the
merciless
logic
of
his
creed
he
honestly
thought
that
every
convert
to
quakerism
became
by
virtue
of
that
conversion
a
child
of
perdition
and
as
the
head
of
the
commonwealth
responsible
for
the
spiritual
as
well
as
temporal
welfare
of
its
inhabitants
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
whip
banish
and
hang
heretics
to
save
his
people
from
perilous
heresy
the
extravagance
of
some
of
the
early
quakers
has
been
grossly
exaggerated
their
conduct
will
compare
in
this
respect
favorably
with
that
of
the
first
anabaptists
and
independents
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
many
of
them
manifested
a
good
deal
of
that
wild
enthusiasm
which
has
always
been
the
result
of
persecution
and
the
denial
of
the
rights
of
conscience
and
worship
their
pertinacious
defiance
of
laws
enacted
against
them
and
their
fierce
denunciations
of
priests
and
magistrates
must
have
been
particularly
aggravating
to
a
man
as
proud
and
high
tempered
as
john
endicott
he
had
that
neighbor
of
his
edward
wharton
smartly
whipped
at
the
about
once
a
month
but
it
may
be
questioned
whether
the
governor
ears
did
not
suffer
as
much
under
wharton
biting
sarcasm
and
free
speech
as
the
latter
back
did
from
the
magisterial
whip
time
has
proved
that
the
quakers
had
the
best
of
the
controversy
and
their
descendants
can
well
afford
to
forget
and
forgive
an
error
which
the
puritan
governor
shared
with
the
generation
in
which
he
lived
west
ossipee
month
john
winthrop
on
the
anniversary
of
his
landing
at
salem
i
see
by
the
call
of
the
essex
institute
that
some
probability
is
suggested
that
i
may
furnish
a
poem
for
the
occasion
of
its
meeting
at
the
willows
on
the
i
would
be
glad
to
make
the
implied
probability
a
fact
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
put
my
thoughts
into
metrical
form
and
there
will
be
little
need
of
it
as
i
understand
a
lady
of
essex
county
who
adds
to
her
modern
culture
and
rare
poetical
gifts
the
best
spirit
of
her
puritan
ancestry
has
lent
the
interest
of
her
verse
to
the
occasion
it
was
a
happy
thought
of
the
institute
to
select
for
its
first
meeting
of
the
season
the
day
and
the
place
of
the
landing
of
the
great
and
good
governor
and
permit
me
to
say
as
thy
father
old
friend
that
its
choice
for
orator
of
the
son
of
him
whose
genius
statesmanship
and
eloquence
honored
the
place
of
his
birth
has
been
equally
happy
as
i
look
over
the
list
of
the
excellent
worthies
of
the
first
emigrations
i
find
no
one
who
in
all
respects
occupies
a
nobler
place
in
the
early
colonial
history
of
massachusetts
than
john
winthrop
like
vane
and
milton
he
was
a
gentleman
as
well
as
a
puritan
a
cultured
and
enlightened
statesman
as
well
as
a
christian
it
was
not
under
his
long
and
wise
chief
magistracy
that
religious
bigotry
and
intolerance
hung
and
tortured
their
victims
and
the
terrible
delusion
of
witchcraft
darkened
the
sun
at
noonday
over
essex
if
he
had
not
quite
reached
the
point
where
to
use
the
words
of
sir
thomas
more
he
could
hear
heresies
talked
and
yet
let
the
heretics
alone
he
was
in
charity
and
forbearance
far
in
advance
of
his
generation
i
am
sorry
that
i
must
miss
an
occasion
of
so
much
interest
i
hope
you
will
not
lack
the
presence
of
the
distinguished
citizen
who
inherits
the
best
qualities
of
his
honored
ancestor
and
who
as
a
statesman
scholar
and
patriot
has
added
new
lustre
to
the
name
of
winthrop
