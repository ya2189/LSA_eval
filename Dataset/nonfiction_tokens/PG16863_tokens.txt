preface
among
the
many
benefits
which
modern
missions
have
conferred
on
the
world
not
the
least
perhaps
is
the
field
they
have
afforded
for
the
development
of
the
highest
excellence
of
female
character
the
limited
range
of
avocations
allotted
to
woman
and
her
consequent
inability
to
gain
an
elevated
rank
in
the
higher
walks
of
life
has
been
a
theme
of
complaint
with
many
modern
reformers
especially
with
the
party
who
are
loud
in
their
advocacy
of
woman
rights
that
few
of
the
sex
have
risen
to
eminence
in
any
path
but
that
of
literature
is
too
well
known
to
admit
of
denial
and
might
be
proved
by
the
scantiness
of
biography
how
few
of
the
memoirs
and
biographical
sketches
which
load
the
shelves
of
our
libraries
record
the
lives
of
women
the
missionary
enterprise
opens
to
woman
a
sphere
of
activity
usefulness
and
distinction
not
under
the
present
constitution
of
society
to
be
found
elsewhere
here
she
may
exhibit
whatever
she
possesses
of
skill
in
the
mastery
of
unknown
and
difficult
dialects
of
tact
in
dealing
with
the
varieties
of
human
character
of
ardor
and
perseverance
in
the
pursuit
of
a
noble
end
under
the
most
trying
discouragements
and
of
exalted
christian
heroism
and
fortitude
that
braves
appalling
dangers
and
even
death
in
its
most
dreadful
forms
in
its
affectionate
devotion
to
earthly
friends
and
the
service
of
a
heavenly
master
compared
with
the
true
independence
the
noble
energy
the
almost
superhuman
intrepidity
of
the
judsons
how
weak
and
despicable
seem
the
struggles
of
many
misguided
women
in
our
day
who
seek
to
gain
a
reluctant
acknowledgment
of
equality
with
the
other
sex
by
a
noisy
assertion
of
their
rights
and
in
some
instances
by
an
imitation
of
their
attire
who
would
not
turn
from
a
female
advocate
at
the
bar
or
judge
upon
the
bench
surrounded
by
the
usual
scenes
of
a
even
if
she
filled
these
offices
with
ability
and
talent
to
render
honor
rather
to
her
who
laying
on
the
altar
of
sacrifice
whatever
of
genius
or
acquirement
or
loveliness
she
may
possess
goes
forth
to
cheer
and
to
share
the
labors
and
cares
of
the
husband
of
her
youth
in
his
errand
of
love
to
the
heathen
and
it
seems
peculiarly
appropriate
that
woman
who
doubtless
owes
to
christianity
most
of
the
domestic
consideration
and
social
advantages
which
in
enlightened
countries
she
regards
as
her
birthright
should
be
the
bearer
of
these
blessings
to
her
less
favored
sisters
in
heathen
lands
if
the
christian
religion
was
a
gospel
to
the
it
was
no
less
emphatically
so
to
woman
whom
it
redeemed
from
social
inferiority
and
degradation
the
fruit
for
ages
of
that
transgression
which
brought
death
into
the
world
and
all
our
wo
never
until
on
the
morning
of
the
resurrection
she
came
early
unto
the
sepulchre
was
she
made
one
in
christ
jesus
in
whom
there
is
neither
in
male
nor
female
with
him
who
had
hitherto
been
her
superior
and
her
master
nor
does
she
seem
to
have
misunderstood
her
high
mission
or
to
have
been
wanting
to
it
the
in
the
infant
churches
rivalled
the
brethren
in
attachment
and
fidelity
to
the
cause
and
to
their
ministry
the
new
religion
was
indebted
in
no
small
degree
for
its
unparalleled
success
perhaps
an
apology
may
be
deemed
necessary
for
memoir
of
the
distinguished
females
whose
names
adorn
our
with
regard
to
the
judson
it
has
been
thought
that
a
simple
narrative
of
her
life
unencumbered
with
details
of
the
history
of
the
mission
would
be
more
attractive
to
youthful
readers
than
the
excellent
biography
by
knowles
of
the
though
we
can
not
hope
or
wish
to
rival
the
graceful
and
spirited
sketch
by
fanny
forrester
still
it
is
believed
that
a
plain
unembellished
story
of
a
life
which
was
in
itself
so
exceedingly
interesting
may
also
find
favor
with
the
public
as
to
the
last
of
these
three
christian
heroines
who
has
so
lately
departed
from
among
us
as
full
a
sketch
as
practicable
is
given
from
a
wish
to
embalm
in
one
urn
perhaps
a
fragile
one
the
memories
of
those
whose
virtues
and
affections
have
contributed
so
largely
to
the
happiness
and
usefulness
of
one
of
the
noblest
and
most
successful
of
modern
missionaries
the
rev
adoniram
judson
the
approval
of
several
of
the
friends
of
the
subjects
of
these
memoirs
has
encouraged
us
in
our
undertaking
and
it
is
our
sincere
desire
that
the
manner
of
its
execution
may
be
found
acceptable
not
only
to
them
but
to
the
friends
of
missions
in
general
and
should
the
work
gain
favor
with
our
youthful
readers

with

chapter
judson
birth
education
and
conversion
when
an
individual
attains
a
position
of
eminence
which
commands
the
admiration
of
the
world
we
naturally
seek
to
learn
his
early
history
to
ascertain
what
indications
were
given
in
childhood
of
qualities
destined
to
shine
with
such
resplendent
lustre
and
to
discover
the
kind
of
discipline
which
has
developed
powers
so
extraordinary
but
in
no
researches
are
we
more
apt
to
be
baffled
than
in
these
few
children
are
so
remarkable
as
to
make
it
worth
while
even
to
a
parent
to
chronicle
their
little
sayings
and
doings
and
of
infant
prodigies
though
there
is
a
superstitious
belief
that
most
of
them
die
early
which
is
expressed
in
the
adage
whom
the
gods
love
die
young
those
that
live
commonly
disappoint
the
hopes
of
partial
friends
who
watched
their
infancy
with
wonder
and
expectation
there
are
certain
qualities
however
which
we
shall
rarely
miss
even
in
the
childhood
of
those
who
attain
eminence
by
a
wise
employment
of
their
talents
and
acquirements
these
are
firmness
of
purpose
industry
and
application
and
an
ardent
and
sometimes
enthusiastic
temperament
these
qualities
were
possessed
in
no
common
degree
by
ann
hasseltine
the
subject
of
this
memoir
she
was
born
in
bradford
massachusetts
on
the
of
december
in
a
sketch
which
she
has
given
of
her
life
between
twelve
and
seventeen
years
of
age
we
find
evidence
of
an
active
ardent
and
social
disposition
gay
and
buoyant
spirits
persevering
industry
and
great
decision
of
character
whatever
engaged
her
attention
whether
study
or
amusement
was
pursued
with
an
ardor
that
excited
the
sympathy
and
love
both
of
her
teachers
and
schoolfellows
though
little
of
her
writing
at
this
period
is
preserved
and
the
generation
that
knew
her
personally
is
mostly
passed
away
yet
her
whole
subsequent
career
gives
evidence
of
an
intellect
of
a
very
high
order
carefully
cultivated
by
study
and
reflection
she
seems
scarcely
to
have
been
the
subject
of
serious
impressions
before
her
seventeenth
year
until
that
time
she
enjoyed
the
pleasures
of
the
world
with
few
misgivings
and
with
a
keenness
of
relish
which
led
her
to
think
herself
as
she
says
the
happiest
creature
on
earth
she
adds
i
so
far
surpassed
my
friends
in
gayety
and
mirth
that
some
of
them
were
apprehensive
i
had
but
a
short
time
to
continue
in
my
career
of
folly
and
should
be
suddenly
cut
off
thus
passed
the
last
winter
of
my
gay
life
during
the
spring
of
she
began
regularly
to
attend
a
series
of
conference
meetings
in
bradford
her
native
town
she
soon
felt
that
the
spirit
of
god
was
operating
on
her
mind
amusements
lost
their
relish
she
felt
that
she
must
have
a
new
heart
or
perish
forever
and
she
often
sought
solitude
that
she
might
unseen
by
others
weep
over
her
deplorable
state
soon
however
her
fears
that
her
distress
might
be
noticed
by
her
companions
were
merged
in
her
greater
terrors
of
conscience
and
she
was
willing
the
whole
universe
should
know
that
she
felt
herself
to
be
a
lost
and
perishing
sinner
her
distress
increased
as
she
became
more
and
more
sensible
of
the
depravity
of
her
heart
and
the
holiness
and
sovereignty
of
god
her
mind
rose
in
rebellion
against
a
being
who
after
all
her
prayers
and
tears
and
still
withheld
from
her
the
blessing
of
pardon
and
peace
she
says
in
this
state
i
longed
for
annihilation
and
if
i
could
have
destroyed
the
existence
of
my
soul
with
as
much
ease
as
that
of
my
body
i
should
quickly
have
done
it
but
that
glorious
being
who
is
kinder
to
his
creatures
than
they
are
to
themselves
did
not
leave
me
to
remain
in
this
distressing
state
the
plan
of
salvation
through
a
crucified
redeemer
gradually
unfolded
itself
before
her
she
began
to
take
delight
in
those
attributes
of
god
which
before
had
filled
her
with
abhorrence
and
although
she
did
not
at
first
imagine
that
this
was
the
new
heart
for
which
she
had
sought
so
earnestly
yet
she
was
constrained
to
commit
all
her
interests
for
time
and
eternity
unreservedly
to
that
saviour
who
now
seemed
infinitely
worthy
of
the
service
of
her
whole
existence
the
change
in
her
from
extreme
worldliness
to
a
life
of
piety
and
prayer
was
deep
and
permanent
hers
was
no
character
while
she
was
of
the
world
she
pursued
its
follies
with
entire
devotion
of
heart
and
when
she
once
renounced
it
as
unsatisfying
and
unworthy
of
her
immortal
aspirations
she
renounced
it
solemnly
and
finally
her
ardor
for
learning
did
not
abate
but
instead
of
being
inspired
as
formerly
by
a
thirst
for
human
applause
and
distinction
it
was
now
prompted
by
her
sense
of
responsibility
to
god
for
the
cultivation
of
the
talents
he
had
given
her
and
her
desire
to
make
herself
increasingly
useful
in
the
sketch
referred
to
she
remarks
i
attended
my
studies
in
school
with
far
different
feelings
and
different
motives
from
what
i
had
ever
done
before
i
felt
my
obligation
to
improve
all
i
had
to
the
glory
of
god
and
since
he
in
his
providence
had
favored
me
with
advantages
for
improving
my
mind
i
felt
that
i
should
be
like
the
slothful
servant
if
i
neglected
them
i
therefore
diligently
employed
all
my
hours
in
school
in
acquiring
useful
knowledge
and
spent
my
evenings
and
part
of
the
night
in
spiritual
enjoyments
such
was
my
thirst
for
religious
knowledge
that
i
frequently
spent
a
great
part
of
the
night
in
reading
religious
books
a
friend
says
of
her
she
thirsted
for
the
knowledge
of
gospel
truth
in
all
its
relations
and
dependencies
besides
the
daily
study
of
the
scripture
with
guise
orton
and
scott
before
her
she
perused
with
deep
interest
the
works
of
edwards
hopkins
belamy
doddridge
with
edwards
on
redemption
she
was
instructed
quickened
strengthened
well
do
i
remember
the
elevated
smile
that
beamed
on
her
countenance
when
she
first
spoke
to
me
of
its
precious
contents
when
reading
scripture
sermons
or
other
works
if
she
met
with
anything
dark
or
intricate
she
would
mark
the
passage
and
beg
the
first
clergyman
who
called
at
her
father
to
elucidate
and
explain
it
how
evidently
to
us
though
unconsciously
to
herself
was
her
heavenly
father
thus
fitting
her
for
the
work
he
was
preparing
for
her
had
she
known
that
she
was
to
spend
her
days
in
instructing
bigoted
and
captious
idolaters
in
religious
knowledge
she
could
not
have
trained
herself
for
the
task
more
wisely
than
she
was
thus
led
to
do
while
under
the
guidance
of
the
spirit
of
truth
she
was
thus
cultivating
her
intellect
that
same
spirit
was
also
sanctifying
and
purifying
her
heart
she
loathed
sin
both
in
herself
and
others
and
strove
to
avoid
it
not
from
the
fear
of
hell
but
from
fear
of
displeasing
her
father
in
heaven
in
one
place
she
writes
were
it
left
to
myself
whether
to
follow
the
vanities
of
the
world
and
go
to
heaven
at
last
or
to
live
a
religious
life
have
trials
with
sin
and
temptation
and
sometimes
enjoy
the
light
of
god
reconciled
countenance
i
should
not
hesitate
a
moment
in
choosing
the
latter
for
there
is
no
real
satisfaction
in
the
enjoyments
of
time
and
sense
on
the
fourteenth
of
august
she
made
a
public
profession
of
religion
and
united
with
the
congregational
church
at
bradford
being
in
her
seventeenth
year
very
early
in
her
religious
life
she
became
sensible
that
if
unusual
advantages
for
acquiring
knowledge
had
fallen
to
her
lot
she
was
the
more
bound
to
use
her
talents
and
acquirements
for
the
benefit
of
others
less
favored
than
herself
actuated
by
such
motives
she
opened
a
small
school
in
her
native
place
and
subsequently
taught
in
several
neighboring
villages
her
example
in
this
respect
is
surely
worthy
of
imitation
perhaps
no
person
is
more
admirable
than
a
young
lady
fitted
like
miss
hasseltine
by
a
cultivated
mind
and
engaging
manners
to
shine
in
society
who
having
the
choice
between
a
life
of
ease
and
one
of
personal
exertion
chooses
voluntarily
or
only
in
obedience
to
the
dictates
of
conscience
the
weary
and
path
of
the
teacher
and
probably
such
a
course
would
oftener
be
chosen
were
young
persons
aware
of
the
unquestionable
fact
that
the
school
in
which
we
make
the
most
solid
and
rapid
improvement
is
that
in
which
we
teach
others
an
extract
from
her
journal
will
sustain
what
we
have
said
of
her
conscientiousness
and
purity
of
motive
in
endeavoring
to
instruct
the
young
have
taken
charge
of
a
few
scholars
ever
since
i
have
had
a
comfortable
hope
in
christ
i
have
desired
to
devote
myself
to
him
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
useful
to
my
as
providence
has
placed
me
in
a
situation
in
life
where
i
have
an
opportunity
of
getting
as
good
an
education
as
i
desire
i
feel
it
would
be
highly
criminal
in
me
not
to
improve
it
i
feel
also
that
it
would
be
equally
criminal
to
desire
to
be
well
educated
and
accomplished
from
selfish
motives
with
a
view
merely
to
gratify
my
taste
and
relish
for
improvement
or
my
pride
in
being
qualified
to
shine
i
therefore
resolved
last
winter
to
attend
the
academy
from
no
other
motive
than
to
improve
the
talents
bestowed
by
god
so
as
to
be
more
extensively
devoted
to
his
glory
and
the
benefit
of
my
on
being
lately
requested
to
take
a
small
school
for
a
few
months
i
felt
very
unqualified
to
have
the
charge
of
little
immortals
but
the
hope
of
doing
them
good
by
endeavoring
to
impress
their
young
and
tender
minds
with
divine
truth
and
the
obligation
i
feel
try
to
be
have
induced
me
to
comply
i
was
enabled
to
open
the
school
with
prayer
though
the
cross
was
very
great
i
felt
constrained
by
a
sense
of
duty
to
take
it
up
o
may
i
have
grace
to
be
faithful
in
instructing
these
children
in
such
a
way
as
shall
be
pleasing
to
my
heavenly
father
such
being
the
principles
by
which
she
was
actuated
in
commencing
the
work
of
instruction
we
can
not
doubt
that
her
efforts
be
were
blessed
not
only
by
the
temporal
but
the
spiritual
advancement
of
her
pupils
some
of
whom
may
appear
with
children
from
distant
burmah
as
crowns
of
her
rejoicing
in
the
last
great
day
footnotes
footnote
she
thus
describes
more
particularly
the
exercises
of
her
mind
in
an
entry
in
her
journal
a
year
later
july
it
is
just
a
year
this
day
since
i
entertained
a
hope
in
christ
about
this
time
in
the
evening
when
reflecting
on
the
words
of
the
lepers
we
enter
into
the
city
then
the
famine
is
in
the
city
and
we
shall
die
there
and
if
we
sit
still
here
we
die
also
i
felt
that
if
i
returned
to
the
world
i
should
surely
perish
if
i
stayed
where
i
then
was
i
should
perish
and
i
could
but
perish
if
i
threw
myself
on
the
mercy
of
christ
then
came
light
and
relief
and
comfort
such
as
i
never
knew
before
chapter
ii
her
marriage
and
voyage
to
india
in
the
calm
current
of
miss
hasseltine
life
was
disturbed
by
circumstances
which
were
to
change
all
her
prospects
and
color
her
whole
future
destiny
from
the
quiet
and
seclusion
of
her
new
england
home
she
was
called
to
go
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
on
a
mission
of
mercy
to
the
dark
browed
and
darker
minded
heathen
it
is
perhaps
impossible
for
us
to
realize
now
what
was
then
the
magnitude
of
such
an
enterprise
our
wonderful
facilities
for
intercourse
with
the
most
distant
nations
and
the
consequent
vast
amount
of
travel
were
entirely
unknown
forty
years
ago
a
journey
of
two
hundred
miles
then
involved
greater
perplexity
and
required
nearly
as
much
preparation
and
was
certainly
attended
with
more
fatigue
than
a
voyage
to
england
at
the
present
day
the
subject
of
evangelizing
the
heathen
in
foreign
countries
had
scarcely
received
any
attention
in
europe
and
in
this
country
there
was
not
even
a
missionary
society
that
a
female
should
renounce
the
refinements
of
her
enlightened
and
christian
home
and
go
thousands
of
miles
across
unknown
oceans
to
the
farthest
verge
of
the
green
earth
to
distant
barbarous
climes
to
spend
her
life
in
an
unhealthy
climate
among
a
race
whose
language
was
strange
to
her
ear
whose
customs
were
revolting
to
her
delicacy
and
who
might
moreover
make
her
a
speedy
victim
to
her
zeal
in
their
behalf
a
thing
so
common
now
as
to
excite
no
surprise
and
little
interest
was
then
hardly
deemed
possible
if
indeed
the
idea
of
it
entered
the
imagination
to
decide
the
question
of
such
an
undertaking
as
this
as
well
as
another
question
affecting
her
individual
happiness
through
life
was
miss
hasseltine
now
summoned
judson
a
graduate
of
brown
university
an
ardent
and
aspiring
scholar
was
one
of
four
or
five
young
men
in
the
then
newly
founded
theological
seminary
at
andover
whose
minds
had
become
deeply
impressed
with
the
wants
of
the
heathen
and
a
desire
to
go
and
labor
among
them
by
their
earnestness
and
perseverance
they
so
far
awakened
an
interest
in
their
project
that
a
board
of
commissioners
for
foreign
missions
was
appointed
and
the
young
men
were
set
apart
as
missionaries
during
the
two
years
in
which
judson
and
his
associates
were
employed
in
efforts
to
accomplish
this
result
he
had
formed
an
acquaintance
with
miss
hasseltine
and
made
her
an
offer
of
his
hand
that
he
had
no
wish
to
blind
her
to
the
extent
of
the
sacrifices
she
would
make
in
accepting
him
his
manly
and
eloquent
letter
to
her
father
asking
his
daughter
in
marriage
abundantly
proves
he
says
i
have
now
to
ask
whether
you
can
consent
to
part
with
your
daughter
early
next
spring
to
see
her
no
more
in
this
world
whether
you
can
consent
to
her
departure
for
a
heathen
land
and
her
subjection
to
the
hardships
and
sufferings
of
a
missionary
life
whether
you
can
consent
to
her
exposure
to
the
dangers
of
the
ocean
to
the
fatal
influence
of
the
southern
climate
of
india
to
every
kind
of
want
and
distress
to
degradation
insult
persecution
and
perhaps
a
violent
death
can
you
consent
to
all
this
for
the
sake
of
him
who
left
his
heavenly
home
and
died
for
her
and
for
you
for
the
sake
of
perishing
immortal
souls
for
the
sake
of
zion
and
the
glory
of
god
can
you
consent
to
all
this
in
hope
of
soon
meeting
your
daughter
in
the
world
of
glory
with
a
crown
of
righteousness
brightened
by
the
acclamations
of
praise
which
shall
redound
to
her
saviour
from
heathens
saved
through
her
means
from
eternal
woe
and
despair
the
writer
of
this
letter
who
after
nearly
forty
years
of
missionary
labor
in
which
he
endured
all
and
more
than
all
he
has
thus
almost
prophetically
described
has
just
gone
to
join
the
noble
army
of
martyrs
and
those
who
came
out
of
great
tribulation
in
his
final
home
as
he
looks
back
on
the
hour
when
he
thus
gave
up
his
life
and
what
was
more
precious
than
life
to
the
service
of
those
souls
dear
as
he
believed
to
the
redeemer
though
perishing
for
lack
of
vision
with
what
deep
and
serene
joy
must
he
contemplate
the
sacrifice
and
she
not
lost
but
gone
before
who
was
there
to
meet
and
welcome
him
to
happier
bowers
than
eden
knew
where
they
rest
from
their
labors
does
she
now
regret
that
to
his
solemn
appeal
she
answered
i
will
go
and
judson
were
married
at
bradford
on
the
fifth
of
february
and
on
the
nineteenth
of
the
same
month
embarked
on
the
brig
caravan
bound
for
calcutta
and
newell
also
missionaries
sailed
in
the
same
vessel
we
will
here
give
some
extracts
from
letters
written
by
judson
to
her
friends
at
home
dated
at
sea
to
her
sister
she
writes
i
find
judson
one
of
the
kindest
most
faithful
and
affectionate
of
husbands
his
conversation
frequently
dissipates
the
gloomy
clouds
of
spiritual
darkness
which
hang
over
my
mind
and
brightens
my
hope
of
a
happy
eternity
i
hope
god
will
make
us
instrumental
of
preparing
each
other
for
usefulness
in
this
world
and
greater
happiness
in
a
future
world
day
before
yesterday
we
came
in
sight
of
land
after
having
been
out
only
one
hundred
and
twelve
days
we
could
distinguish
nothing
but
the
lowering
mountains
of
golconda
yesterday
we
were
nearer
land
and
the
scene
was
truly
delightful
reminding
me
of
the
descriptions
i
have
read
of
the
fertile
shores
of
india
the
groves
of
orange
and
palm
trees
yesterday
we
saw
two
vessels
you
have
no
idea
how
interesting
the
sight
a
vessel
at
the
side
of
us
so
near
we
could
hear
the
captain
speak
for
he
was
the
first
person
we
have
heard
speak
since
we
sailed
except
what
belong
to
our
ship
last
night
was
the
most
dangerous
and
to
me
by
far
the
most
unpleasant
we
have
had
the
scene
is
truly
delightful
we
are
sailing
up
the
river
hoogly
a
branch
of
the
ganges
and
so
near
the
land
that
we
can
distinctly
discover
objects
on
one
side
of
us
are
the
sunderbunds
islands
at
the
mouth
of
the
ganges
the
smell
which
proceeds
from
them
is
fragrant
beyond
description
on
each
side
of
the
hoogly
are
the
hindoo
cottages
as
thick
together
as
the
houses
in
our
seaports
they
are
very
small
and
in
the
form
of
without
either
chimneys
or
windows
they
are
situated
in
the
midst
of
trees
which
hang
over
them
and
appear
truly
romantic
the
grass
and
fields
of
rice
are
perfectly
green
and
herds
of
cattle
are
everywhere
feeding
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
the
natives
are
scattered
about
some
fishing
some
driving
the
team
and
some
sitting
indolently
on
the
bank
of
the
river
the
pagodas
we
have
passed
are
much
handsomer
and
larger
than
the
houses
there
are
many
english
seats
near
the
shore
oh
what
reason
we
have
to
be
thankful
for
so
pleasant
and
prosperous
a
voyage
well
sister
we
are
safe
in
calcutta
harbor
and
almost
stunned
with
the
noise
of
the
natives
judson
has
gone
on
shore
to
find
a
place
for
us
to
go
the
city
is
by
far
the
most
elegant
of
any
i
have
ever
seen
many
ships
are
lying
at
anchor
and
hundreds
of
natives
all
around
they
are
dressed
very
curiously
their
white
garments
hanging
loosely
over
their
shoulders
but
i
have
not
time
to
describe
anything
at
present
harriet
and
i
are
yet
on
board
the
vessel
and
have
not
been
on
land
judson
has
not
yet
gained
permission
for
us
to
live
in
the
country
he
and
newell
are
gone
again
and
what
will
be
their
success
i
know
not
the
east
india
company
are
violently
opposed
to
missions
and
have
barely
given
permission
to
their
own
countrymen
to
settle
here
as
preachers
we
have
nothing
to
expect
from
man
and
everything
from
god
if
god
has
anything
for
us
to
do
here
he
will
doubtless
open
a
door
for
our
entrance
not
he
will
send
us
to
some
other
chapter
iii
her
arrival
at
difficulties
with
the
bengal
voyage
to
the
isle
of
death
of
mrs
change
of
voyage
to
rangoon
and
judson
landed
at
calcutta
on
the
of
june
and
were
hospitably
received
by
the
venerable
carey
who
immediately
conducted
them
to
his
home
in
serampore
there
they
found
a
delightful
mission
family
consisting
of
carey
marshman
and
ward
with
their
wives
and
children
who
welcomed
them
most
cordially
and
invited
them
to
remain
until
the
arrival
of
their
brother
missionaries
of
the
arrangements
in
this
truly
christian
family
the
schools
the
religious
exercises
the
cultivation
of
the
gardens
belonging
to
the
establishment
and
the
instruction
communicated
to
the
natives
they
express
themselves
in
the
highest
terms
of
eulogy
hitherto
the
course
of
our
missionaries
in
their
enterprise
had
indeed
run
smooth
and
they
had
begun
to
flatter
themselves
that
they
had
the
trials
and
dangers
of
the
life
they
had
chosen
but
sad
reverses
awaited
them
they
had
been
in
serampore
but
ten
days
when
judson
and
newell
were
summoned
to
calcutta
where
an
order
from
government
was
read
to
them
commanding
them
immediately
to
leave
the
country
and
return
to
america
the
british
east
india
company
were
at
that
time
unfriendly
to
missions
and
especially
intolerant
to
missionaries
from
america
the
idea
of
returning
without
effecting
the
object
for
which
they
had
left
their
native
land
was
too
painful
to
be
endured
by
the
missionaries
and
they
immediately
attempted
to
gain
permission
to
go
to
some
country
not
under
the
burmah
the
field
to
which
they
had
been
assigned
by
their
brethren
at
home
seemed
for
various
reasons
utterly
inaccessible
but
they
finally
got
leave
to
take
passage
in
a
ship
bound
for
the
isle
of
france
the
vessel
would
however
accommodate
but
two
passengers
and
the
health
of
newell
requiring
that
she
should
be
in
a
place
of
quiet
it
was
agreed
that
she
and
her
husband
should
embark
in
it
for
three
months
the
rest
of
their
company
remained
in
calcutta
watched
with
jealousy
by
the
british
government
but
unable
to
find
a
vessel
to
convey
them
away
at
length
they
had
peremptory
orders
to
embark
in
a
vessel
bound
to
england
all
hope
of
escape
seemed
now
cut
off
when
judson
accidentally
learned
that
a
ship
was
about
sailing
for
the
isle
of
france
they
applied
for
a
passport
to
go
on
board
of
her
but
were
refused
they
informed
the
captain
of
the
vessel
of
their
circumstances
and
were
allowed
to
go
on
board
without
a
pass
they
had
got
but
a
few
miles
down
the
river
however
when
a
government
despatch
overtook
them
commanding
the
pilot
to
conduct
the
ship
no
further
as
there
were
persons
on
board
who
had
been
ordered
to
england
by
advice
of
the
captain
the
missionaries
left
the
ship
and
went
on
shore
while
the
pilot
wrote
a
certificate
that
no
such
persons
were
on
board
the
captain
being
angry
at
the
detention
of
his
vessel
ordered
them
to
take
their
baggage
from
it
immediately
but
at
length
consented
to
let
it
remain
on
board
until
he
should
reach
a
tavern
sixteen
miles
further
down
the
river
judson
also
remained
in
the
ship
until
it
came
opposite
the
tavern
where
she
says
the
pilot
kindly
lent
me
his
boat
and
a
servant
to
go
on
shore
i
immediately
procured
a
large
boat
to
send
to
the
ship
for
our
baggage
i
entered
the
tavern
a
and
i
called
for
a
room
and
sat
down
to
reflect
on
my
disconsolate
situation
i
had
nothing
with
me
but
a
few
rupees
i
did
not
know
that
the
boat
which
i
had
sent
after
the
vessel
would
overtake
it
and
if
it
did
whether
it
would
ever
return
with
our
baggage
neither
did
i
know
where
judson
was
or
when
he
would
come
or
with
what
treatment
i
should
meet
at
the
tavern
i
thought
of
and
said
to
myself
are
some
of
the
trials
attendant
upon
a
missionary
life
and
which
i
have
in
a
few
hours
arrived
and
toward
night
our
baggage
after
two
or
three
days
of
great
perplexity
and
distress
and
when
they
had
given
up
all
hope
of
being
able
to
proceed
to
the
isle
of
france
they
unexpectedly
received
from
an
unknown
friend
a
magistrate
to
go
on
board
the
creole
the
vessel
they
had
left
their
only
difficulty
now
was
that
she
had
probably
got
out
to
sea
as
it
was
three
days
since
they
had
left
her
however
they
hastened
down
the
river
seventy
miles
to
saugur
where
among
many
ships
at
anchor
they
had
the
inexpressible
happiness
to
find
the
creole
on
which
they
embarked
for
the
isle
of
france
their
first
destination
their
dangers
on
the
passage
to
the
isle
of
france
were
great
the
vessel
being
old
and
leaky
and
when
they
reached
there
they
found
little
encouragement
to
remain
while
on
the
island
had
a
severe
attack
of
illness
as
well
as
much
depression
of
spirits
from
the
uncertainties
of
their
situation
after
much
deliberation
they
determined
to
establish
themselves
on
an
island
near
malacca
to
reach
which
they
must
first
go
to
madras
and
they
accordingly
sailed
for
that
place
war
having
broken
out
between
england
and
america
the
hostility
of
the
east
india
directors
to
american
missionaries
was
of
course
much
increased
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
make
any
stop
at
all
in
madras
without
incurring
the
danger
of
being
sent
back
to
america
what
then
was
their
distress
on
their
arrival
there
to
find
no
ship
bound
for
the
island
they
wished
to
visit
their
way
seemed
entirely
hedged
up
for
the
only
vessel
in
madras
harbor
ready
for
sea
was
destined
to
burmah
a
country
pronounced
by
all
their
friends
in
india
utterly
inaccessible
in
her
journal
at
this
time
writes
oh
our
heavenly
father
direct
us
aught
where
wilt
thou
have
us
to
go
what
wilt
thou
have
us
to
do
our
only
hope
is
in
thee
and
to
thee
only
do
we
look
for
protection
oh
let
this
mission
live
before
thee
she
adds
at
a
somewhat
later
date
we
expect
to
embark
for
rangoon
in
burmah
adieu
to
polished
refined
christian
society
our
lot
is
not
cast
among
you
but
among
pagans
among
barbarians
whose
tender
mercies
are
cruel
indeed
we
voluntarily
forsake
you
and
for
jesus
sake
choose
the
latter
for
our
associates
o
may
we
be
prepared
for
the
pure
and
polished
society
of
heaven
composed
of
the
followers
of
the
lamb
whose
robes
have
been
washed
in
his
blood
everything
combined
to
render
the
passage
to
rangoon
unpleasant
and
perilous
sickness
threatened
shipwreck
and
the
want
of
all
comforts
but
at
length
on
the
of
july
about
eighteen
months
from
the
time
they
left
salem
in
massachusetts
they
set
their
wandering
feet
on
that
shore
which
was
to
be
their
future
home
among
the
depressing
circumstances
that
had
occurred
in
this
gloomy
period
not
the
least
painful
was
the
death
of
judson
early
friend
and
companion
in
her
eastern
voyage
harriet
newell
of
less
mental
and
physical
vigor
than
judson
this
amiable
and
ardent
christian
had
gladly
relinquished
all
other
objects
in
life
for
that
of
sharing
the
privations
and
soothing
the
cares
of
a
husband
to
whom
she
was
tenderly
attached
in
his
labors
among
the
heathen
but
this
privilege
was
denied
her
she
was
not
even
permitted
to
reach
a
scene
of
missionary
labor
her
husband
was
compelled
to
bury
her
in
a
far
distant
isle
of
the
ocean
and
finish
his
short
earthly
course
alone
but
he
lived
to
see
the
grave
of
that
young
martyr
missionary
visited
by
many
pilgrim
feet
and
her
name
embalmed
in
many
admiring
hearts
how
keenly
judson
felt
her
loss
may
be
learned
from
a
letter
written
from
the
isle
of
france
whither
she
and
her
husband
went
on
being
driven
from
calcutta
have
at
last
arrived
in
port
but
oh
what
news
what
distressing
news
harriet
is
dead
harriet
my
dear
friend
my
earliest
associate
in
the
mission
is
no
more
oh
death
could
not
this
wide
world
afford
thee
victims
enough
but
thou
must
enter
the
family
of
a
solitary
few
whose
comfort
and
happiness
depended
so
much
on
the
society
of
each
other
could
not
this
infant
mission
be
shielded
from
thy
shafts
but
be
still
my
heart
and
know
that
god
has
done
it
just
and
true
are
thy
ways
oh
thou
king
of
saints
another
heavy
trial
was
the
separation
of
herself
and
husband
from
the
church
in
which
they
were
both
educated
from
the
missionary
association
on
which
they
depended
for
support
and
from
the
sympathies
of
those
christians
in
their
native
land
who
had
hitherto
given
them
the
most
cordial
encouragement
in
their
enterprise
this
separation
was
in
consequence
of
a
change
in
their
sentiments
in
regard
to
baptism
so
liberal
has
the
church
become
at
this
day
that
all
now
look
upon
this
change
as
having
decidedly
advanced
the
cause
of
missions
by
enlisting
a
large
and
respectable
body
of
christians
in
this
country
not
hitherto
engaged
in
it
but
in
a
step
like
this
on
the
part
of
beneficiaries
of
the
board
could
not
but
be
regarded
with
much
disfavor
and
prejudice
render
those
who
had
taken
it
highly
unpopular
and
even
subject
their
motives
to
unworthy
imputations
whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
soundness
of
their
new
views
therefore
there
is
not
the
shadow
of
a
reason
to
doubt
their
conscientiousness
in
adopting
them
that
they
did
it
in
the
face
of
every
worldly
motive
their
letters
and
journals
abundantly
prove
judson
writes
it
is
extremely
trying
to
reflect
on
the
consequences
of
our
becoming
baptists
we
must
make
some
very
painful
sacrifices
we
must
be
separated
from
our
dear
missionary
associates
and
labor
alone
in
some
isolated
spot
we
must
expect
to
be
treated
with
contempt
and
to
be
cast
off
by
many
of
our
american
friends
forfeit
the
character
we
have
in
our
native
land
and
probably
have
to
labor
for
our
own
support
wherever
we
are
stationed
these
things
are
very
trying
to
us
and
cause
our
hearts
to
bleed
for
anguish
we
feel
that
we
have
no
home
in
this
world
and
no
friend
but
each
other
a
renunciation
of
our
former
sentiments
has
caused
us
more
pain
than
anything
which
ever
happened
to
us
through
our
lives
thus
perplexed
but
not
in
despair
cast
down
but
not
destroyed
they
reached
rangoon
then
the
capital
of
the
burman
empire
and
established
themselves
in
what
they
regarded
as
their
future
home
here
remote
unfriended
and
solitary
reft
of
every
stay
but
heaven
they
were
destined
to
pass
nearly
two
years
before
their
hearts
could
be
cheered
by
the
intelligence
from
america
of
the
general
interest
awakened
for
them
there
in
the
denomination
with
which
they
had
connected
themselves
and
the
formation
of
a
baptist
board
of
missions
which
had
appointed
them
its
missionaries
of
one
thing
however
they
must
have
felt
sure
that
they
were
conducted
there
by
the
special
providence
of
god
the
honor
of
commencing
the
burman
mission
says
gammell
is
to
be
ascribed
rather
to
the
divine
head
of
the
church
than
to
any
leading
movement
or
agency
of
the
baptist
denomination
the
way
was
prepared
and
the
field
was
opened
by
god
alone
and
it
only
remained
for
laborers
to
enter
in
and
prosecute
the
noble
work

which
they
had
been
summoned

directed

years

of
the
most

it
is
proper
to
pause
here

give
something
more
than
a

glance
at
its
natural
features
its
government

and
the

for

its
entire

from

is
traversed
by
the
irrawaddy
which
after
a
course
of
miles
empties
by
many
mouths
into
the
bay
of
bengal
its
territory
is
generally
so
much
elevated
above
the
level
of
the
sea
that
it
enjoys
though
in
the
torrid

a
comparatively
salubrious
and
temperate
climate
the
heat
is
rarely
excessive
while
winter
in
our
sense
of
the
word
is
unknown
the
general
features
of
a
country
so
extensive
are
of
course
widely
diversified
it
may
be
said
of
it
as
a
whole
in
the
language
of
hamilton
that
in
fertility
beauty
and
grandeur
of
scenery
and
in
the
variety
value
and
elegance
of
its
natural
productions
it
is
equalled
by
few
on
earth
in
the
parts
of
the

there
are
two

thus
writes
i
have
now
passed
the
ordeal
of
the
entire
hot
season
and
of
nothing
am
i
more
convinced
both
from
experience
and
observation
than
that
the
climate
is
as
salubrious
and
pleasant
as
any
other
in
the
world
i
have
suffered
much
more
from
heat
in
italy
and
even
in
philadelphia
than
i
have
ever
done
here
and
have
never
found
a
moment
when
i
could
not
be
perfectly
comfortable
by
sitting
still
to
go
abroad
at
is
however
for
any
but
natives
eminently
hazardous
the
soil
in
the
maritime
provinces
is
represented
as
unsurpassed
in
fertility
and
under
the
imperfect
cultivation
of
the
natives
yields
from
eighty
to
a
hundred
fold
and
sometimes
more
the
heights
are
crowned
with
forests
while
the
low
lands
are
jungle
that
is
a
region
of
many
trees
but
scattered
with
much
undergrowth
and
the
haunt
of
tigers
and
other
wild
animals

numerous
and
of
names
and
kinds
unknown
in
america
there
is
found
the
mangosteen
with
a
fruit
said
by
travellers
to
be
the
most
delicious
in
the
world
the
noble
mango
growing
to
the
height
of
one
hundred
feet
and
of
vast
diameter
and
bearing
as
great
a
variety
of

fruit
as
the
does
with
us
the
whose
fruit
we
are

with
and

cordage
the
plantain
that
invaluable
blessing
to
the
natives
of
the
torrid

as
it
supplies
them
bread
without
much
labor

circumstance
of
importance

hard

is
oppressive

of

and
a
dense

veined
with

the
long
shining
pods
which
contain
the

its
pulpy
fruit
contained
in
a
husk
resembling
the
pineapple
in
shape
and
the
curious
palmyra
whose
leaves
furnish
the
natives
with
paper
while
its
trunk
yields
a
liquor
much
prized
by
them
as
drink
and
capable
of
being
boiled
down
into
sugar
like
the
juice
of
our
maple
hundreds
of
other
trees
might
be
named
many
valuable
for
their
fruit
others
for
their
timber
and
some
for
both
most
of
the
trees
are
evergreen
that
is
few
of
them
shed
their
leaves
annually
and
at
once
but
a
constant
succession
of
leaves
makes
the
forest
always
verdant
besides
the
fruits
which
grow
upon
trees
there
is
a
variety
of
others
such
as
berries
tomatoes
pineapples
and
among
roots
are
found
the
ginger
licorice
irish
potatoe
asparagus
the
country
abounds
in
flowers
of
most
splendid
colors
but
generally
deficient
in
fragrance
though
some
have
a
fine
perfume
the
favorite
food
of
the
country
being
rice
this
is
of
course
the
grain
most
extensively
cultivated
there
are
no
as
with
us
cultivators
of
the
soil
always
reside
in
villages
for
mutual
protection
against
wild
beasts
and
robbers
each
family
cultivates
a
patch
of
the
neighboring
jungle
and
brings
the
produce
into
the
village
where
the
cattle
are
also
brought
for
security
besides
rice
they
cultivate
wheat
millet
and
indigo
but
generally
in
a
slovenly
and
unskilful
manner
in
the
dry
season
the
land
is
watered
by
artificial
means
some
of
which
are
quite
ingenious
of
animals
there
is
of
course
a
vast
variety
one
of
the
most
useful
of
which
is
the
buffalo
which
is
used
to
draw
their
carriages
as
well
as
to
perform
the
labor
that
the
ox
does
with
us
elephants
are
the
property
of
the
king
but
great
men
are
allowed
to
keep
them
the
birds
in
burmah
though
of
gay
plumage
have
little
melody
in
their
song
splendid
as
they
are
we
would
scarce
exchange
for
them
our
cheerful
robin
and
merry
bobolink
reptiles
and
insects
though
numerous
are
not
so
troublesome
or
so
venomous
as
in
many
parts
of
the
torrid
zone
the
white
ant
is
perhaps
as
destructive
as
any
other
insect
and
the
greatest
precaution
hardly
preserves
one
from
its
intrusion
the
burmans
are
as
a
race
superior
to
the
hindoos
being
more
athletic
and
vigorous
and
more
lively
and
industrious
they
are
less
tall
than
americans
their
complexions
dark
their
noses
flat
and
their
lips
thick
and
full
the
hair
is
very
abundant
black
and
glossy
but
generally
rather
coarse
men
tie
it
in
a
knot
on
the
of
the
head
and
intertwine
it
with
the
turban
women
turn
it
all
back
and
without
a
comb
form
it
into
a
graceful
knot
frequently
adding
chaplets
of
fragrant
natural
flowers
strung
on
a
thread
both
sexes
take
great
pains
with
their
hair
frequently
washing
it
with
a
substance
which
has
the
properties
of
soap
and
keeping
it
anointed
with
sweet
oil
the
custom
of
blacking
the
teeth
is
almost
universal
when
asked
the
reason
of
this
custom
the
answer
is
what
should
we
have
white
teeth
like
a
dog
or
a
monkey
smoking
and
chewing
are
also
universal
malcom

i
have
seen

their
mouth
tobacco
is
not
used
alone
for
these
purposes

several
other

the

of

its

shows
it
is
not
native
to

the
natural
good
traits
of
the
burman
character
are
almost
rendered
nugatory
by
their
religion
and
the
oppressive
nature
of
their
government
the
latter
is
an
absolute
despotism
the
king
has
a
nominal
council
with
whom
he
may
advise
but
whose
advice
he
may
if
he
chooses
treat
with
utter
contempt
it
is
not
however
the
direct
oppression
of
the
monarch
that
causes
most
suffering
among
his
subjects
it
is
rather
that
of
the
inferior
officers
of
government
whose
rapacity
and
extortion
renders
property
liberty
and
life
itself
insecure
deceit
fraud
and
lying
are
the
natural
if
not
necessary
consequences
of
a
system
which
leaves
the
people
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
those
who
bear
rule
over
them
the
religion
is
buddhism
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
superstitions
existing
on
the
face
of
the
earth
its
sacred
divinity
or
buddh
is
gaudama
who
has
passed
into
a
state
of
eternal
and
unconscious
repose
which
they
consider
the
summit
of
felicity
but
which
seems
to
us
to
differ
little
from
annihilation
images
of
this
god
are
the
chief
objects
of
worship
these
are
found
in
every
house
and
are
enshrined
in
pagodas
and
temples
and
in
sacred
caves
which
appear
to
have
been
used
from
time
immemorial
for
religious
purposes
the
wealth
and
labor
bestowed
on
the
latter
show
how
great
the
population
must
have
been
in
former
ages
malcom
describes
one
cave
on
the
salwen
which
is
wholly
filled
with
images
of
every
size
while
the
whole
face
of
the
mountain
for
ninety
feet
above
the
cave
is
incrusted
with
them
on
every
jutting
crag
stands
some
marble
image
covered
with
gold
and
spreading
its
uncouth
proportions
to
the
setting
sun
every
recess
is
converted
into
shrines
for
others
but
imposing
as
is
this
spectacle
it
shrinks
into
insignificance
compared
with
the
scene
presented
on
entering
the
cavern
itself
it
is
of
vast
size
and
needs
no
human
art
to
render
it
sublime
the
eye
is
confused
and
the
heart
appalled
at
the
prodigious
exhibition
of
infatuation
and
folly
everywhere
on
the
floor
over
head
and
on
every
jutting
point
are
crowded
together
images
of
gaudama
the
offerings
of
successive
ages
a
ship
of
five
hundred
tons
could
not
carry
away
the
half
of
them
pagodas
are
innumerable
in
the
inhabited
parts
there
is
scarcely
a
peak
bank
or
swelling
hill
uncrowned
by
one
of
these
structures
in
general
they
are
almost
solid
without
door
or
window
and
contain
some
supposed
relic
of
gaudama
the
religious
system
of
the
burmans
contains
many
excellent
moral
precepts
and
maxims
which
however
being
without
sanction
or
example
are
utterly
powerless
to
mould
the
character
of
the
people
to
wisdom
or
virtue
a
curious
feature
of
buddhism
is
that
one
of
the
highest
motives
it
presents
to
its
followers
is
the
obtaining
of
merit
merit
is
obtained
by
avoiding
sins
such
as
theft
lying
intoxication
and
the
like
and
by
practising
virtues
and
doing
good
works
the
most
meritorious
of
all
good
works
is
to
make
an
idol
the
next
to
build
a
pagoda
it
confers
high
merit
also
to
build
a
zayat
to
transcribe
the
sacred
books
to
erect
any
useful
public
edifice
to
dig
public
wells
or
to
plant
shade
or
by
the
wayside
if
they
give
alms
or
treat
animals
kindly
or
repeat
prayers
or
do
any
other
good
deed
they
do
it
entirely
with
this
mercenary
view
of
obtaining
merit
this
merit
is
not
so
much
to
procure
them
happiness
in
another
world
as
to
secure
them
from
suffering
in
their
future
transmigrations
in
this
for
they
believe
that
the
soul
of
one
who
dies
without
having
laid
up
any
merit
will
have
to
pass
into
the
body
of
some
mean
reptile
or
insect
and
from
that
to
another
through
hundreds
of
changes
perhaps
before
it
will
be
allowed
again
to
take
the
form
of
man
this
reliance
on
and
certainty
of
obtaining
it
through
prescribed
methods
fosters
their
conceit
so
that
ignorant
and
debased
as
they
are
there
is
scarcely
a
nation
more
offensively
proud
it
also
renders
them
entirely
incapable
of
doing
or
appreciating
a
disinterested
action
or
of
feeling
such
a
sentiment
as
gratitude
if
you
do
them
a
favor
they
suppose
you
do
it
to
obtain
merit
for
yourself
and
of
course
feel
no
obligation
to
you
the
simple
phrase
i
thank
you
is
unknown
in
their
language
like
the
ancient
romans
the
burmans
believe
in
dreams
omens
and
unlucky
days
observe
the
flight
and
feeding
of
fowls
the
howl
of
dogs
and
the
aspect
of
the
stars
they
regard
the
lines
in
the
hand
the
knots
in
trees
and
a
thousand
other
fortuitous
circumstances
and
by
these
allow
their
actions
to
be
governed
the
priesthood
in
burmah
is
arranged
into
a
regular
hierarchy
the
highest
functionary
is
a
kind
of
archbishop
who
presides
over
all
the
other
priests
in
the
empire
and
appoints
the
presidents
of
the
monasteries
he
resides
at
the
imperial
court
where
he
has
a
high
rank
and
is
considered
one
of
the
greatest
men
in
the
kingdom
below
him
are
various
ranks
of
priests
each
having
his
appointed
sphere
and
appropriate
duties
and
all
supported
by
the
contributions
of
the
people
the
number
of
priests
is
exceedingly
great
and
their
sway
over
the
minds
of
the
people
almost
unlimited
but
great
and
potent
as
the
priests
of
buddh
are
says
a
writer
in
the
foreign
quarterly
review
there
is
a
kind
of
sacred
personage
still
greater
than
the
highest
of
them
and
next
in
rank
to
the
sovereign
this
is
no
other
than
that
diseased
animal
the
white
elephant
far
more
highly
venerated
here
than
in
siam
the
creature
is
supposed
by
the
burmans
to
lodge
within
its
carcass
a
blessed
soul
of
some
human
being
which
has
arrived
at
the
last
stage
of
the
many
millions
of
transmigrations
it
was
doomed
to
undergo
and
which
when
it
escapes
will
be
absorbed
into
the
essence
of
the
deity
this
most
sacred
personage
has
a
regular
cabinet
composed
of
a
prime
minister
secretary
of
state
transmitter
of
intelligence
possesses
estates
in
various
parts
of
the
country
and
receives
handsome
presents
from
foreign
ambassadors
his
residence
is
contiguous
to
the
royal
palace
and
connected
with
it
by
a
long
open
gallery
at
the
further
end
of
which
a
curtain
of
black
velvet
embossed
with
gold
conceals
his
august
person
from
vulgar
eyes
his
dwelling
is
a
lofty
hall
splendidly
gilded
and
supported
by
pillars
to
four
of
which
he
is
chained
with
massive
silver
chains
his
bed
is
a
thick
mattress
covered
with
blue
cloth
over
which
is
a
softer
one
of
crimson
silk
his
trappings
are

studded
with

sapphires

and
other
precious
stones

are

inlaid
with

stones
his
attendants
according
to
hamilton
from
whom
we
take
a
part
of
this
description
amount
to
over
a
thousand
persons
buddhism
in
its
moral
precepts
is
perhaps
the
best
religion
ever
invented
by
man
the
difficulty
is
its
entire
basis
is
false
it
is
a
religion
of
atheism
instead
of
a
heavenly
father
forgiving
sin
and
filial
service
from
a
pure
heart
as
the
effect
of
love
it
presents
nothing
to
love
for
its
deity
is
dead
nothing
as
the
ultimate
object
of
action
but
self
and
nothing
for
man
highest
and
holiest
ambition
but
annihilation
their
doctrine
of
merit
leaves
no
place
for
holiness
and
destroys
gratitude
either
to
god
or
man
it
also
ministers
to
the
grossest
pride
for
the
very
fact
of
his
being
a
assures
the
buddhist
that
in
numberless
former
unremembered
transmigrations
he
must
have
acquired
incalculable
merit
or
he
would
not
now
occupy
so
distinguished
a
rank
in
the
scale
of
being
their
system
of
balancing
evil
with
good
reduces
all
sin
to
a
thing
of
little
importance
if
any
man
sin
in
burmah
his
religion
tells
him
of
no
advocate
with
the
father
on
whose
altar
he
may
lay
the
tribute
of
a
believing
penitent
obedient
and
grateful
heart
but
instead
it
tells
him
he
may
repeat
a
form
of
words
he
may
feed
a
priest
he
may
build
a
pagoda
he
may
carve
an
idol
and
thus
balance
his
iniquity
with
merit
if
any
man
suffer
in
burmah
his
religion
points
him
to
no
place
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
and
where
god
himself
will
wipe
away
all
tears
from
all
faces
but
it
dictates
a
proud
submission
to
unalterable
fate
and
flatters
him
that
his
sufferings
here
may
purchase
immunity
from
torment
in
some
unknown
future
existence
and
finally
if
any
man
die
in
burmah
his
religion
tells
him
of
no
saviour
who
has
passed
through
the
grave
and
blessed
the
bed
and
swallowed
up
death
in
victory
but
it
threatens
degradation
perhaps
into
a
soulless
brute
or
at
best
a
place
of
expiatory
misery
in
short
living
or
dying
the
burman
may
be
said
emphatically
to
be
without
hope
and
without
god
in
the
world
such
was
the
stupendous
system
of
superstition
and
ignorance
which
two
feeble
missionaries
armed
like
david
when
he
met
the
philistine
with
trust
in
the
lord
his

ventured
to
attack

most

merely
a
vast
collection
of
bamboo
huts
with
narrow
streets

an

deserted
just
outside
the

occupied
by

from

was

unfinished

comfortless

it
had
a
garden
full
of

around

was
rural
and
pleasant

found

christian

only
person
remaining
of

former

was

peculiar
trials
and
encouragements
at
this
time
will
be
best
learned
by
extracts
from
her
letters
and
journal
she
writes
we
felt
very
gloomy
and
dejected
the
first
night
we
arrived
in
view
of
our
prospects
but
we
were
enabled
to
lean
on
god
and
to
feel
that
he
was
able
to
support
us
under
the
most
discouraging
circumstances
the
next
morning
i
prepared
to
go
on
shore
but
hardly
knew
how
i
should
get
to
carey
house
it
was
however
concluded
that
i
should
be
carried
in
an
consequently
when
i
landed
one
was
provided
through
which
were
put
two
bamboos
and
four
of
the
natives
took
me
on
their
shoulders
when
they
had
carried
me
a
little
way
into
the
town
they
set
me
down
under
a
shade
when
great
numbers
of
the
natives
gathered
round
having
seldom
seen
an
english
female
being
sick
and
weak
i
held
my
head
down
which
induced
many
of
the
native
females
to
come
very
near
and
look
under
my
bonnet
at
this
i
looked
up
and
smiled
on
which
they
set
up
a
loud
laugh
they
again
took
me
up
to
carry
and
the
multitude
of
natives
gave
a
shout
which
much
diverted
us
they
next
carried
me
to
a
place
they
call
the
it
was
a
small
open
shed
in
which
were
seated
on
mats
several
natives
who
were
the
officers
after
searching
judson
very
closely
they
asked
liberty
for
a
native
female
to
search
me
to
which
i
readily
consented
i
was
then
brought
to
the
where
i
have
nearly
recovered
my
health
it
is
now
a
week
since
we
arrived
here
my
health
is
quite
restored
and
i
feel
much
more
contented
and
happy
than
i
ever
expected
to
be
in
such
a
situation
i
think
i
enjoy
the
promises
of
god
in
a
higher
degree
than
ever
before
and
have
attained
more
true
peace
of
mind
and
trust
in
the
saviour
when
i
look
back
to
my
late
situation
in
that
wretched
old
vessel
without
any
accommodations
scarcely
the
necessaries
of
life
no
physician
no
female
attendants
so
weak
that
i
could
not
move
i
hope
i
am
deeply
sensible
of
the
kind
care
of
my
heavenly
father
in
carrying
me
safely
through
the
peculiar
dangers
of
the
voyage
and
giving
me
once
more
a
on
land
still
were
it
not
for
the
support
we
derive
from
the
gospel
of
jesus
we
should
be
ready
to
sink
down
in
despondency
in
view
of
the
dark
and
gloomy
scenes
around
us
but
when
we
recollect
that
jesus
has
commanded
his
disciples
to
carry
the
gospel
to
the
heathen
and
promised
to
be
with
them
to
the
end
of
the
world
that
god
has
promised
to
give
the
heathen
to
his
son
for
an
inheritance
we
are
encouraged
to
make
a
beginning
though
in
the
midst
of
discouragement
and
leave
it
to
him
to
grant
success
in
his
own
time
and
way
i
find
here
no
female
friends
with
whom
i
can
unite
in
social
prayer
nor
even
one
with
whom
i
can
converse
i
have
indeed
no
society
at
all
except
that
of
judson
yet
i
feel
happy
in
thinking
that
i
gave
up
this
source
of
pleasure
as
well
as
most
others
for
the
sake
of
the
poor
heathen
in
her
journal
we
find
the
following
sentiment
though
we
find
ourselves
almost
destitute
of
all
those
sources
of
enjoyment
to
which
we
have
been
accustomed
and
are
in
the
midst
of
a
people
who
are
at
present
almost
destitute
on
account
of
the
scarcity
of
provisions
though
we
are
exposed
to
robbers
by
night
and
invaders
by
day
yet
we
both
unite
in
saying
that
we
never
were
happier
never
more
contented
in
any
situation
than
the
present
we
feel
that
this
is
the
post
to
which
god
hath
appointed
us
that
we
are
in
the
path
of
duty
and
though
surrounded
with
danger
and
death
we
feel
that
god
can
with
infinite
ease
preserve
and
support
us
under
the
most
heavy
sufferings
oh
if
it
may
please
the
dear
redeemer
to
make
me
instrumental
of
leading
some
of
the
females
of
burmah
to
a
saving
acquaintance
with
him
my
great
object
will
be
accomplished
my
highest
desires
gratified
i
shall
rejoice
to
have
relinquished
my
comforts
my
country
and
my
home
oh
lord
here
i
am
thou
hast
brought
me
to
this
heathen
land
and
given
me
desires
to
labor
for
thee
do
with
me
what
pleaseth
thee
make
me
useful
or
not
as
seemeth
good
in
thy
sight
but
oh
let
my
soul
live
before
thee
let
me
serve
none
but
thee
let
me
have
no
object
in
life
but
the
promotion
of
thy
glory
i
have
begun
to
study
the
language
find
it
very
hard
and
difficult
having
none
of
the
usual
helps
in
acquiring
a
language
except
a
small
part
of
a
grammar
and
six
chapters
of
gospel
by
carey
now
at
ava
have
been
writing
letters
this
week
to
my
dear
friends
in
america
found
that
a
recollection
of
former
enjoyments
in
my
own
native
country
made
my
situation
here
appear
less
tolerable
the
thought
that
i
had
parents
sisters
and
beloved
friends
still
in
existence
and
at
such
a
distance
that
it
was
impossible
to
obtain
one
look
or
exchange
a
word
was
truly
painful
while
they
are
still
in
possession
of
the
comforts
i
once
enjoyed
i
am
an
exile
from
my
country
and
my
house
deprived
of
all
society
and
every
friend
but
one
and
with
scarcely
the
necessaries
of
life
privations
would
not
be
endured
with
patience
in
any
other
cause
but
that
in
which
we
are
but
since
it
is
thy
cause
blessed
jesus
we
rejoice
that
thou
didst
give
us
so
many
enjoyments
to
sacrifice
and
madest
it
so
plainly
our
duty
to
forsake
all
in
order
to
bring
thy
truth
to
the
benighted
heathen
we
would
not
resign
our
work
but
live
contented
with
our
lot
and
live
to
thee
yes
i
do
feel
thankful
that
god
has
brought
me
to
this
heathen
land
and
placed
me
in
a
situation
peculiarly
calculated
to
make
me
feel
my
dependence
on
him
and
my
constant
need
of
the
influences
of
the
holy
spirit
i
enjoy
more
in
reading
the
scriptures
and
in
secret
prayer
than
for
years
before
and
the
prosperity
of
this
mission
and
the
conversion
of
this
people
lie
with
weight
on
my
mind
and
draw
forth
my
heart
in
constant
intercession
i
do
confidently
believe
that
god
will
visit
this
land
with
gospel
light
that
these
idol
temples
will
be
and
temples
for
the
worship
of
the
living
god
be
erected
in
their
stead
let
us
here
pause
for
a
moment
and
contemplate
the
picture
brought
by
these
words
before
our
imagination
let
us
survey
the
scene
in
which
the
lonely
missionary
penned
this
prediction
a
vast
country
not
waste
and
uninhabited
but
enriched
by
the
partial
sun
with
every
natural
gift
to
cheer
the
sense
and
gratify
the
taste
of
man
swarming
with
human
beings
endowed
with
capacities
for
advancement
in
knowledge
and
virtue
and
temporal
enjoyment
as
well
as
for
immortal
happiness
yet
who
having
said
in
their
heart
there
is
no
god
minds
the
affairs
of
men
have
built
up
for
themselves
a
fabric
of
absurd
superstitions
and
unmeaning
rites
and
senseless
formalities
to
which
they
cling
with
a
stubbornness
that
nothing
but
the
power
of
god
can
subdue
on
such
a
shore
are
cast
by
the
providence
of
god
two
strangers
not
endowed
with
apostolic
gifts
not
able
to
control
disease
or
raise
the
dead
or
even
to
speak
in
a
foreign
tongue
without
long
and
patient
and
assiduous
study
to
acquire
it
and
yet
with
a
simple
and
sublime
faith
in
the
clear
and
sure
word
of
their
master
go
preach
my
gospel
lo
i
am
with
you
these
pilgrim
strangers
can
confidently
believe
that
god
will
visit
this
land
with
gospel
light
and
that
those
gilded
fanes
which
now
glisten
in
the
morning
and
evening
sun
on
every
will
fall
and
those
poor
idolaters
will
say
what
have
we
to
do
any
more
with
idols
our
trust
is
in
the
name
of
the
lord
that
made
heaven
and
earth
in
one
of
the
last
paragraphs
of
her
private
journal
which
has
been
preserved
dated
of
the
same
year
she
says
i
have
been
into
the
town
and
i
was
surprised
at
the
multitude
of
people
with
which
the
streets
are
filled
their
countenances
are
intelligent
and
they
appear
to
be
capable
under
the
influence
of
the
gospel
of
becoming
a
valuable
and
respectable
people
but
at
present
their
situation
is
truly
deplorable
for
they
are
given
to
every
sin
lying
is
so
universal
among
them
that
they
say
can
not
live
without
telling
lies
they
believe
the
most
absurd
notions
imaginable
my
teacher
told
me
the
other
day
that
when
he
died
he
would
go
to
my
country
i
shook
my
head
and
told
him
he
would
not
but
he
laughed
and
said
he
would
i
did
not
understand
the
language
sufficiently
to
tell
him
where
he
would
go
or
how
he
could
be
saved
oh
thou
light
of
the
world
dissipate
the
thick
darkness
that
covers
burmah
display
thy
grace
and
power
among
the
burmans
subdue
them
to
thyself

make
them
thy
chosen

of
the

voyage
to
her
return
to
birth
of
a
son
those
who
have
acquired
a
modern
european
language
with
the
aid
of
grammars
dictionaries
and
other
suitable
books
can
scarcely
estimate
the
labor
of
learning
without
such
aids
such
a
language
as
the
burman
in
fact
judson
thinks
more
progress
can
be
made
in
the
in
a
few
months
than
in
the
burman
in
two
years
judson
took
the
whole
management
of
family
affairs
on
herself
in
order
to
leave
her
husband
at
liberty
to
prosecute
his
studies
and
the
consequence
was
that
being
obliged
constantly
to
use
all
the
burman
she
knew
in
her
intercourse
with
servants
traders
and
others
her
progress
was
more
rapid
than
his
one
cause
of
difficulty
in
learning
their
language
was
that
their
books
were
made
of
marked
or
engraved
with
an
iron
style
or
pen
we
who
are
accustomed
to
clear
characters
on
paper
can
hardly
imagine
the
difficulty
of
tracing
out
these
obscure
scratches
on
the
dried
another
was
that
in
writing
their
words
are
not
fairly
divided
like
ours
by
breaks
and
points
and
capitals
but
run
together
in
a
long
continuous
line
a
sentence
or
paragraph
seeming
like
one
long
word
another
difficulty
was
that
in
their
idiom
a
great
variety
of
verbs
must
be
used
to
express
one
action
either
as
performed
by
persons
of
different
rank
or
as
done
under
different
circumstances
thus
there
are
three
or
four
ways
to
speak
of
eating
rice
sleeping
dying
one
of
which
is
always
used
of
the
king
another
of
priests
another
of
rulers
and
another
of
common
persons
and
it
would
be
an
insult
to
use
a
phrase
lower
than
one

entitled
to
again

term

for

there
are
many
words

another

another

they
have
in
their
language
eleven
vowels
and
consonants
but
of
these
there
are
so
many
combinations
that
about
one
thousand
characters
must
be
used
in
printing

unknown
to
the
burmans
until
our
missionaries
introduced
it
as
no
progress
at
all
could
be
made
in
their
missionary
labors
until
the
language
was
mastered
they
applied
themselves
cheerfully
and
diligently
to
its
acquisition
an
interesting
incident
is
related
by
judson
under
date
of
her
first
visit
to
the
wife
of
a
man
in
power
for
the
first
time
i
have
visited
the
wife
of
the
viceroy
i
was
introduced
to
her
by
a
french
lady
who
has
frequently
visited
her
when
we
first
arrived
at
the
government
house
she
was
not
up
consequently
we
had
to
wait
some
time
but
the
inferior
wives
of
the
viceroy
diverted
us
much
by
their
curiosity
in
minutely
examining
everything
we
had
on
and
by
trying
on
our
gloves
bonnets
at
last
her
highness
made
her
appearance
richly
dressed
in
the
burman
fashion
with
a
long
silver
pipe
in
her
mouth
smoking
at
her
appearance
all
the
other
wives
took
their
seats
at
a
respectful
distance
and
sat
in
a
crouching
posture
without
speaking
she
received
me
very
politely
took
me
by
the
hand
seated
me
upon
a
mat
and
herself
by
me
one
of
the
women
brought
her
a
bunch
of
flowers
of
which
she
took
several
and
ornamented
my
cap
she
was
very
inquisitive
whether
i
had
a
husband
and
children
whether
i
was
my
husband
first
wife
meaning
by
this
whether
i
was
the
highest
among
them
supposing
that
judson
like
the
burmans
had
many
wives
and
whether
i
intended
tarrying
long
in
the
country
when
the
viceroy
came
in
i
really
trembled
for
i
never
before
beheld
such
a
creature
his
long
robe
and
enormous
spear
not
a
little
increased
my
dread
he
spoke
to
me
however
very
condescendingly
and
asked
whether
i
would
drink
some
rum
or
wine
when
i
arose
to
go
her
highness
took
my
hand
again
told
me
she
was
happy
to
see
me
and
that
i
must
come
to
see
her
every
day
she
led
me
to
the
door
i
made
my
and
departed
my
object
in
visiting
her
was
that
if
we
should
go
into
any
difficulty
with
the
burmans
i
could
have
access
to
her
when
perhaps
it
would
not
be
possible
for
judson
to
have
an
audience
with
the
viceroy
in
pursuing
his
study
of
the
language
judson
had
fortunately
secured
as
a
teacher
a
burman
of
more
than
ordinary
intelligence
and
who
had
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
grammatical
construction
of
the
burman
dialect
and
also
of
the
or
language
of
the
sacred
books
day
after
day
he
sat
with
his
teacher
in
the
open
verandah
which
surrounded
their
dwelling
reading
writing
and
talking
joined
by
judson
in
every
interval
she
could
spare
from
family
cares
and
thus
were
they
fitting
themselves
to
teach
to
the
poor
idolaters
the
new
religion
nor
did
they
neglect
such
opportunities
of
doing
good
as
presented
themselves
even
then
but
every
effort
to
inculcate
their
sentiments
was
met
with
the
objection
your
religion
is
good
for
you
ours
for
us
you
will
be
rewarded
for
your
good
deeds
in
your
way
we
in
our
way
they
found
they
had
to
deal
with
one
of
the
proudest
and
most
conceited
races
on
earth
their
very
religion
as
we
have
before
said
encourages
this
conceit
by
leading
them
constantly
to
make
a
merit
of
their
good
actions
or
what
they
suppose
such
while
it
inculcates
neither
contrition
nor
penitence
the
peculiar
doctrines
of
christianity
its
justification
through
the
merits
of
another
its
humility
and
charity
were
in
the
last
degree
opposed
to
the
character
of
the
burman
race
the
missionaries
were
made
daily
more
sensible
that
the
spirit
of
god
must
come
with
power
before
the
truth
could
ever
enter
those
darkened
understandings
prayer
was
therefore
their
only
reliance
as
it
was
their
only
comfort
but
even
this
enjoyment
as
far
as
it
was
social
was
soon
broken
in
upon
by
the
increasing
illness
of
judson
which
obliged
her
to
try
the
effect
of
a
change
of
scene
and
climate
she
could
not
think
of
taking
judson
from
his
labors
and
therefore
embarked
alone
in
january
for
madras
we
may
imagine
the
joy
experienced
by
the
missionary
thus
left
behind
on
receiving
during
her
absence
letters
from
this
country
containing
an
account
of
the
general
movement
in
america
in
favor
of
the
mission
and
the
formation
of
the
baptist
general
convention
his
heart
overflowed
with
gratitude
and
the
thought
that
though
he
had
no
friend
near
him
there
were
yet
hundreds
in
his
native
land
praying
and
laboring
in
the
same
cause
inspired
him
with
new
zeal
in
his
beloved
enterprise
judson
journey
though
solitary
was
prosperous
and
successful
friends
appeared
for
her
where
she
least
expected
them
the
influence
of
her
engaging
person
and
winning
manners
is
observable
in
one
obliging
attention
she
received
even
from
strangers
the
viceroy
appointed
a
woman
to
accompany
her
free
of
expense
the
captain
refused
money
for
her
passage
and
the
physician
at
madras
from
whom
she
had
received
visits
for
six
weeks
returned
the
fee
which
she
sent
him
saying
he
was
happy
if
he
had
been
of
service
to
her
her
health
being
perfectly
restored
she
returned
to
rangoon
after
an
absence
of
three
months
and
on
the
of
september
was
made
the
happy
mother
of
a
little
son
she
soon
resumed
her
studies
and
though
she
saw
little
other
result
of
her
labors
was
cheered
by
noticing
that
she
and
her
husband
were
gradually
gaining
the
confidence
of
the
natives
who
as
she
says
would
say
to
each
other
that
they
need
not
be
afraid
to
trust
us
for
we
do
not
tell
falsehoods
as
the
burmans
do
the
indolent
and
deceitful
burmans
saw
with
surprise
that
these
two
christians
always
kept
themselves
busily
employed
and
paid
every
debt
they
contracted
with
strict
punctuality
thus
was
laid
the
foundation
of
respect
for
the
new
religion

difficulty
of
inculcating
the
death
of
her
failure
of
judson
arrival
of
and
hough
at
rangoon
in
a
letter
which
judson
wrote
to
her
sisters
in
december
she
says
doubtless
you
expect
by
this
time
that
some
of
the
burmans
have
embraced
the
christian
religion
or
at
least
are
seriously
inquiring
respecting
it
but
you
can
not
imagine
how
very
difficult
it
is
to
give
them
any
idea
of
the
true
god
and
the
way
of
salvation
by
christ
since
their
present
ideas
of
deity
are
so
very
low
they
have
not
the
least
idea
of
a
divinity
who
is
eternal
without
beginning
or
end
all
their
deities
have
been
through
the
several
grades
of
creatures
from
a
fowl
to
a
god
they
know
of
no
other
atonement
for
sin
than
offerings
to
their
priests
or
their
pagodas
she
goes
on
to
mention
some
instances
of
serious
inquiry
among
the
people
which
from
time
to
time
had
raised
their
hopes
only
to
dash
them
again
by
the
relapse
of
the
inquirers
into
indifference
but
adds
these
things
do
not
discourage
us
it
is
god
alone
who
can
effectually
impress
the
mind
with
divine
truths
and
though
seed
may
lie
buried
long
in
the
dust
yet
at
some
future
period
it
may
spring
up
and
bear
fruit
to
the
glory
of
god
in
this
letter
she
gives
an
account
of
the
recall
of
the
viceroy
from
rangoon
to
ava
the
imperial
residence
and
the
consequent
confusion
of
the
people
ten
thousand
of
whom
accompanied
him
to
ava
she
regretted
his
departure
as
both
he
and
his
lady
had
ever
treated
her
with
civility
and
kindness
the
newly
appointed
viceroy
was
a
stranger
and
might
not
be
equally
kind
to
them
she
says
oh
how
i
long
to
visit
bradford
to
spend
a
few
evenings
by
your
firesides
in
telling
you
what
i
have
seen
and
heard
alas
have
no
fireside
no
social
circle
we
are
still
alone
in
this
miserable
country
surrounded
by
thousands
ignorant
of
the
true
god
but
we
still
feel
happy
in
our
employment
and
have
reason
to
thank
god
that
he
has
brought
us
here
we
do
hope
to
live
to
see
the
scriptures
translated
into
the
burman
language
and
a
church
formed
from
among
these
idolaters
her
next
letter
details
with
all
the
pathos
of
a
mother
sorrow
a
new
trial
to
which
they
were
called
by
him
who
though
clouds
and
darkness
are
about
him
yet
doeth
all
things
well
my
dear
parents
little
did
i
think
when
i
wrote
you
last
that
my
next
letter
would
be
filled
with
the
melancholy
subject
upon
which
i
must
now
write
death
regardless
of
our
lonely
situation
has
entered
our
dwelling
and
made
one
of
the
happiest
of
families
wretched
our
little
roger
williams
our
only
little
darling
boy
was
three
days
ago
laid
in
the
silent
grave
eight
months
we
enjoyed
the
precious
little
gift
in
which
time
he
had
so
completely
entwined
himself
around
his
parents
hearts
that
his
existence
seemed
necessary
to
their
own
but
god
has
taught
us
by
affliction
what
we
would
not
learn
by
mercies
that
our
hearts
are
his
exclusive
property
and
whatever
rival
intrudes
he
will
tear
it
away
he
was
a
remarkably
pleasant
child
never
cried
except
when
in
pain
and
what
we
often
observed
to
each
other
was
the
most
singular
he
never
during
his
little
existence
manifested
the
least
anger
or
resentment
at
anything
this
was
not
owing
to
the
want
of
intellect
for
his
tender
feelings
of
sensibility
were
very
conspicuous
whenever
i
or
his
father
passed
his
cradle
without
taking
him
he
would
follow
us
with
his
eyes
to
the
door
when
they
would
fill
with
tears
his
countenance
so
expressive
of
grief
though
perfectly
silent
that
it
would
force
us
back
to
him
which
would
cause
his
little
heart
to
be
as
joyful
as
it
had
before
been
sorrowful
he
would
lie
hours
on
a
mat
by
his
or
by
the
side
of
his
chair
on
the
floor
if
he
could
only
see
his
face
when
we
had
finished
study
or
the
business
of
the
day
it
was
our
exercise
and
amusement
to
carry
him
round
the
house
or
garden
and
though
we
were
alone
we
felt
not
our
solitude
when
he
was
with
us
her
account
of
his
last
sickness
and
death
follows
and
she
adds
thus
died
our
little
roger
pain
short
grief
dear
babe
was
thine
now
joys
eternal
and
divine
we
buried
him
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
in
a
little
enclosure
the
other
side
of
the
garden
forty
or
fifty
burmans
and
portuguese
followed
with
his
afflicted
parents
the
last
remains
to
the
silent
grave
all
the
burmans
who
were
acquainted
with
us
tried
to
sympathize
with
us
and
console
us
under
our
loss
we
do
not
feel
a
disposition
to
murmur
or
inquire
of
our
sovereign
why
he
has
done
this
we
wish
rather
to
sit
down
submissively
under
the
rod
and
bear
the
smart
till
the
end
for
which
the
affliction
was
sent
shall
be
accomplished
our
hearts
were
bound
up
in
this
child
we
felt
he
was
our
earthly
all
our
only
source
of
innocent
recreation
in
this
heathen
land
but
god
saw
it
was
necessary
to
remind
us
of
our
error
and
strip
us
of
our
little
all
oh
may
it
not
be
in
vain
that
he
has
done
it
may
we
so
improve
it
that
he
will
stay
his
hand
and
say
is
enough
a
while
after
this
she
writes
since
worship
i
have
stolen
away
to
a
much
loved
spot
where
i
love
to
sit
and
pay
the
tribute
of
affection
to
my
lost
darling
child
it
is
a
little
enclosure
of
in
the
centre
of
which
is
erected
a
small
bamboo
house
on
a
rising
spot
of
ground
which
looks
down
on
the
grave
of
our
infant
boy
here
i
now
sit
and
though
all
nature
around
wears
a
most
delightful
and
romantic
appearance
yet
my
heart
is
sad
and
my
tears
frequently
stop
my
pen
you
my
dear
who
are
a
mother
may
imagine
my
sensations
but
if
you
have
never
lost
a
first
born
an
only
son
you
can
never
know
my
pain
had
you
even
buried
your
little
boy
you
are
in
a
christian
country
surrounded
by
friends
and
relatives
who
could
soothe
your
anguish
and
direct
your
attention
to
other
objects
but
behold
us
solitary
and
alone
with
this
one
source
of
recreation
yet
this
is
denied
us
this
must
be
removed
to
show
us
that
we
need
no
other
source
of
enjoyment
but
god
himself
do
not
think
though
i
write
thus
that
i
repine
at
the
dealings
of
providence
no
though
he
slay
me
yet
will
i
trust
in
him
though
i
say
with
the
prophet
behold
and
see
if
there
be
any
sorrow
like
unto
my
sorrow
yet
i
would
also
say
it
is
of
the
lord
mercies
that
we
are
not
consumed
because
his
compassions
fail
not
god
is
the
same
when
he
afflicts
as
when
he
is
merciful
just
as
worthy
of
our
entire
trust
and
confidence
now
as
when
he
entrusted
us
with
the
precious
little
gift
there
is
a
bright
side
even
to
this
heavy
affliction
the
following
tender
and
beautiful
effusion
was
written
by
the
rev
lawson
of
the
serampore
mission
and
presented
to
judson
on
this
occasion
as
it
has
not
been
published
in
former
notices
of
we
take
pleasure
in
inserting
it
here

the
murmuring
thought
thy
will
be
done
o
arbiter
of
life
and
death
i
bow
to
thy
command
i
yield
the
precious
gift
so
late
bestowed
and
to
the
silent
grave
move
sorrowing
yet
submissive
o
sweet
babe
i
lay
thee
down
to
rest
the
cold
cold
earth

pillow
for
thy
little
head

on
serene
in
death
no
care
shall
trouble
thee
all
undisturbed
thou
slumberest
far
more
still
than
when
i
lulled
thee
in
my
lap
and
thy
little
sorrows
till
they
ceased
then
felt
thy
mother
peace
her
heart
was
light
as
the
sweet
sigh
that
thy
placid
lips
and
joyous
as
the
dimpled
smile
that
played
across
thy
o
i
must
weep
to
think
of
thee
dear
infant
on
my
knees
untroubled
sleeping
bending
thy
form
i
watch
with
eager
hope
to
catch
the
laugh
first
waking
from
thy
sparkling
eye

beam
lovely
to
me
as
the
blue
light
of
heaven

in
death

beams
no
more
oh
yet
once

marble

with
mine

a
long
farewell

in

visioned

bitter
pangs
still
be
thou
in
my
thoughts
and
i
will
cherish
the
dear
dream
and

i
still
possess
thee

my
bursting
heart
o
i
submit
again
i
lay
thee
down
dear
relic
of
a
mother

thy
spirit
now
mingled
with
cherubic
hosts
adores
that
grace
that
ransomed
it
and
lodg
it
safe
above
the
stormy
scene
she
then
gives
an
interesting
account
of
a
visit
paid
them
by
the
wife
of
the
viceroy
who
on
hearing
of
the
death
of
the
white
as
she
called
him
came
to
condole
with
his
parents
she
was
attended
by
about
two
hundred
of
her
officers
of
state
and
members
of
her
household
expressed
great
sympathy
in
judson
affliction
and
reproached
her
for
not
having
sent
her
word
that
she
might
have
come
to
the
funeral
judson
says
i
regaled
her
with
tea
sweetmeats
and
cakes
with
which
she
seemed
much
pleased
she
adds
i
sometimes
have
good
opportunities
of
communicating
religious
truths
to
the
women
in
the
and
hope
i
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
conversing
with
the
wife
of
the
viceroy
herself
oh
that
she
might
become
a
real
disciple
of
jesus
in
the
same
melancholy
letter
she
relates
another
affliction
judson
who
had
frequently
been
asked
by
the
natives
are
your
religious
books
had
been
diligently
employed
in
preparing
a
tract
in
the
burman
language
called
summary
of
christian
truth
when
his
nervous
system
and
especially
his
head
became
so
afflicted
that
he
was
obliged
to
lay
aside
all
study
and
seriously
think
of
a
voyage
to
calcutta
as
his
only
means
of
restoration
but
he
was
prevented
from
executing
his
design
by
the
joyful
news
that
two
additional
missionaries
were
about
to
join
them
and
hough
from
america
arrived
in
rangoon
in
october
and
brought
with
them
as
a
present
from
the
mission
at
serampore
a
printing
press
with
a
fount
of
types
in
the
burman
character
than
which
nothing
could
have
been
more
acceptable
can
we
wonder
that
after
laboring
in
loneliness
and
sorrow
three
years
such
an
event
as
this
should
fill
their
hearts
with
joy
and
consolation
the
burmans
are
very
generally
taught
to
read
though
having
little
that
is
attractive
in
their
own
literature
and
books
being
scarce
and
dear
they
could
not
at
the
time
of
which
we
write
be
said
to
be
a
reading
people
still
the
fact
that
numbers
were
able
to
read
was
a
strong
encouragement
to
print
tracts
and
books
for
them
on
the
occasion
of
printing
the
tract
and
a
catechism
hough
writes
thus
these
two
little
tracts
are
the
first
printing
ever
done
in
burmah
and
it
is
a
fact
grateful
to
every
christian
feeling
that
god
has
reserved
the
introduction
of
this
art
here
for
his
own
use
chapter
viii
missionary
female
intellect
in
description
of
a
pagoda
of
burman
worship
and
offerings
a
circumstance
still
more
cheering
to
the
hearts
of
the
missionaries
than
even
the
arrival
of
companions
from
their
beloved
native
land
was
a
visit
of
a
burman
who
having
read
the
two
little
books
from
the
press
of
hough
came
to
inquire
further
into
the
new
religion
when
judson
first
heard
from
the
lips
of
an
idolater
the
confession
that
god
is
a
being
without
beginning
or
end
not
subject
to
old
age
or
death
but
who
always
is
his
feelings
were
indescribable
and
overpowering
here
at
length
was
a
germination
of
that
seed
they
had
so
long
been
sowing
in
tears
for
if
one
heathen
heart
could
be
thus
led
by
the
spirit
to
investigate
the
truth
why
not
why
not
many
and
why
might
not
the
same
spirit
lead
them
to
him
who
is
not
only
the
truth
but
the
way
the
way
to
heaven
they
soon
received
visits
from
other
burmans
who
had
seen
the
tracts
issued
by
them
and
who
seemed
desirous
of
learning
the
truth
but
still
very
fearful
of
being
known
as
inquirers
it
became
necessary
therefore
to
seek
the
patronage
of
the
government
and
judson
determined
so
soon
as
he
should
have
finished
his
dictionary
of
the
language
to
proceed
to
ava
the
residence
of
the
emperor
judson
met
every
sabbath
a
society
of
fifteen
or
twenty
females
to
whom
she
read
the
scriptures
and
talked
about
god
they
were
attentive
and
willing
to
ask
and
answer
questions
but
for
a
long
time
experienced
no
abiding
convictions
of
sin
or
of
duty
some
were
willing
to
serve
christ
if
they
could
do
it
without
renouncing
dependence
on
their
own
merits
others
would
serve
god
if
they
might
serve
gaudama
also
as
there
is
a
tendency
in
enlightened
minds
to
feel
a
contempt
for
the
intellect
of
barbarians
and
as
some
have
even
felt
that
time
spent
as
judson
was
with
those
native
females
was
thrown
away
we
will
here
record
her
testimony
to
the
intelligence
of
the
burmese
women
the
females
of
this
country
are
lively
inquisitive
strong
and
energetic
susceptible
of
friendship
and
the
warmest
attachment
and
possess
minds
capable
of
rising
to
the
highest
state
of
cultivation
and
refinement
this
is
evident
from
their
mode
of
conversing
and
may
be
illustrated
by
some
particulars
in
the
experience
of
one
of
them
named
previous
to
the
arrival
of
the
missionaries
in
her
country
her
active
mind
was
led
to
inquire
the
origin
of
all
things
who
created
all
that
her
eyes
beheld
she
inquired
of
all
she
met
and
visited
priests
and
teachers
in
vain
and
such
was
her
anxiety
that
her
friends
feared
for
her
reason
she
resolved
to
learn
to
read
that
she
might
consult
the
sacred
books
her
husband
willing
to
gratify
her
curiosity
taught
her
to
read
himself
in
their
sacred
literature
she
found
nothing
satisfactory
for
ten
years
she
prosecuted
her
inquiries
when
god
in
his
providence
brought
to
her
notice
a
tract
written
by
judson
in
the
burmese
language
which
so
far
solved
her
difficulties
that
she
was
led
to
seek
out
its
author
from
him
she
learned
the
truths
of
the
gospel
and
by
the
holy
spirit
those
truths
were
made
the
means
of
her
conversion
she
became
an
ornament
to
her
profession
and
her
daily
walk
and
conversation
would
shame
many
professors
in
christian
countries
christians
in
america
was
judson
time
thrown
away
when
she
was
leading
burmese
females
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
as
it
is
in
jesus
one
of
the
most
splendid
buildings
in
the
empire
is
a
pagoda
at
rangoon
in
which
is
enshrined
a
relic
of
gaudama
at
this
pagoda
a
yearly
feast
is
celebrated
which
lasts
three
days
and
draws
people
together
from
all
parts
of
the
country
judson
says
if
young
could
have
seen
the
devotion
of
this
people
to
their
idolatry
he
might
well
have
exclaimed
for
a
heathen
zeal
in
christian
hearts
even
while
i
am
writing
my
ears
are
stunned
with
the
noise
and
confusion
of
preparation
for
an
approaching
festival
could
you
my
dear
sir
but
once
witness
this
annual
feast
could
you
behold
the
enthusiasm
of
their
devotions
you
would
readily
admit
that
nothing
short
of
an
almighty
arm
could
break
down
these
strong
barriers
and
cause
the
introduction
of
the
gospel
the
pagoda
itself
is
thus
described
by
malcom
two
miles
from
rangoon
stands
the
celebrated
pagoda
called
it
stands
upon
a
small
hill
surmounted
by
many
smaller
pagodas
and
many
noble
trees
the
hill
has
been
graduated
into
successive
terraces
sustained
by
brick
walls
and
the
summit
which
is
completely
leveled
contains
about
two
acres
the
two
principal
approaches
from
the
city
are
lined
on
each
side
for
a
mile
with
fine
pagodas
some
almost
vieing
for
size
with
shoodagon
itself
passing
these
on
your
way
from
the
city
you
come
to
a
flight
of
steps
covered
by
a
curious
arcade
of
little
houses
of
various
forms
and
sizes
some
in
partial
decay
others
truly
beautiful
after
crossing
some
terraces
covered
in
the
same
manner
you
reach
the
top
and
passing
a
great
gate
enter
at
once
this
sad
but
imposing
theatre
of
gaudama
glory
one
first
impressions
are
what
grandeur
what
magnificence
what
absurd
imagery
what
extravagant
expenditure
what
long
successions
of
devotees
to
procure
this
throng
of
buildings
of
such
various
dates
what
a
poor
religion
which
makes
such
labors
its
chief
meritoriousness
before
you
stands
the
huge
shoodagon
its
top
among
the
clouds
and
its
golden
sides
blazing
in
the
glories
of
an
eastern
sun
around
are
pompous
zayats
noble
pavements
gothic
mausoleums
uncouth
colossal
lions
curious
stone
umbrellas
graceful
cylindrical
banners
of
muslin
hanging
from
lofty
pillars
enormous
stone
jars
in
rows
to
receive
offerings
tapers
burning
before
the
images
exquisite
flowers
displayed
on
every
side
filling
the
air
with
fragrance
and
a
multitude
of
carved
figures
of
idols
griffins
guardians
always
in
the
morning
men
and
women
are
seen
in
every
direction
kneeling
behind
their
gift
and
with
uplifted
hands
reciting
their
devotions
often
with
a
string
of
beads
counting
over
each
repetition
aged
persons
sweep
out
every
place
or
pick
out
the
grass
from
the
crevices
dogs
and
crows
struggle
around
the
altars
and
devour
the
recent
offerings
the
great
bells
utter
their
frequent
tones
and
the
mutter
of
praying
voices
makes
a
hum
like
the
buzzing
of
an
exchange
every
worshipper
brings
a
present
often
a
bunch
of
flowers
or
a
few
green
twigs
plucked
on
the
way
but
generally
the
nicest
eatables
ready
cooked
beautiful
bunches
of
flowers
articles
of
raiment
the
amount
of
offerings
here
is
very
great

shall

who
can
wonder
at
the
difficulty
of
turning
this

from

such
a
gorgeous
and

ceremonial

of
such
perfect
congeniality

the
unhumbled
heart
to
the
spiritual
doctrines
of
the

judson
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
mentions
the
splendor
and
costliness
of
some
of
the
religious
offerings
one
of
which
cost
three
thousand
tickals
or
twelve
hundred
dollars
after
a
description
of
the

its
worshippers
she
says
the
ground
on
which
the
pagoda
is
situated
commands
a
view
of
the
surrounding
country
which
presents
one
of
the
most
beautiful
landscapes
in
nature
the
polished
spires
of
the
pagodas
glistening
among
the
trees
at
a
distance
appear
like
the
steeples
of
in
our
american
seaports
the
verdant
appearance
of
the
country
the
hills
and
valleys
ponds
and
rivers
the
banks
of
which
are
covered
with
cattle
and
fields
of
rice
each
in
turn
attract
the
eye
and
cause
the
beholder
to
exclaim
was
this
delightful
country
made
to
be
the
residence
of
idolaters
oh
my
friend
scenes
like
these
productive
of
feelings
so
various
and
so
opposite
do
notwithstanding
fire
the
soul
with
an
unconquerable
desire
to
rescue
this
people
from
destruction
and
lead
them
to
the
rock
that
is
higher
than
they
under
date
of
january
judson
writes
that
they
still
live
quietly
unmolested
by
government
and
that
they
receive
much
respect
and
affection
from
the
viceroy
and
his
family
she
had
some
opportunities
of
private
religious
conversation
with
the
vicereine
to
whom
she
presented
a
translation
of
matthew
gospel
and
a
catechism
still
the
heart
of
the
lady
appeared
unaffected
though
she
ordered
her
daughters
to
be
instructed
in
the
new
catechism
the
inquirer
who
was
mentioned
as
having
afforded
judson
such
lively
satisfaction
had
been
appointed
to
a
government
in
a
distant
province
so
that
they
saw
little
of
him
but
were
gratified
to
learn
that
his
interest
in
religious
books
still
continued

of
mr
his
departure
for
mrs
judson
heroic
mr
judson
return
we
have
now
to
relate
some
distressing
events
connected
with
the
mission
which
for
a
time
threatened
its
very
existence
judson
having
decided
to
commence
a
course
of
public
preaching
to
the
natives
thought
best
to
secure
the
assistance
of
a
native
convert
from
the
province
of
arracan
who
spoke
the
burman
language
to
assist
him
in
his
first
public
efforts
he
therefore
embarked
for
that
province
leaving
judson
to
continue
her
efforts
with
the
females
under
her
instruction
while
and
hough
were
to
prosecute
the
study
of
the
language
he
intended
to
be
gone
but
three
months
but
at
the
end
of
that
period
when
his
return
was
daily
expected
a
vessel
from
chittagong
the
port
to
which
he
had
sailed
arrived
at
rangoon
bringing
the
distressing
tidings
that
neither
he
nor
the
vessel
he
sailed
in
had
been
heard
of
at
that
port
letters
received
by
judson
from
bengal
also
brought
similar
intelligence
while
the
missionaries
left
in
rangoon
were
in
this
state
of
fearful
alarm
and
suspense
hough
received
an
order
to
repair
instantly
to
the
court
house
with
a
threat
that
if
he
did
not
tell
all
the
truth
in
relation
to
the
foreigners
they
would
write
with
his
heart
blood
this
message
spread
consternation
among
the
native
teachers
domestics
and
adherents
some
of
whom
heard
that
a
royal
order
had
arrived
for
the
banishment
of
all
foreign
teachers
hough
was
detained
at
the
from
day
to
day
on
the
most
flimsy
pretences
ignorant
of
the
language
and
with
no
one
to
intercede
with
the
government
in
his
behalf
for
it
was
contrary
to
etiquette
for
a
woman
to
appear
before
the
viceroy
his
family
being
absent
judson
being
at
length
convinced
that
the
petty
officers
of
government
were
acting
in
this
matter
without
authority
and
for
the
purpose
of
extorting
money
from
hough
with
the
intrepidity
that
always
marked
her
character
taking
her
life
in
her
hand
went
boldly
to
the
palace
with
a
petition
for
his
release
the
viceroy
immediately
granted
it
and
commanded
that
hough
should
receive
no
further
molestation
to
add
to
the
distresses
of
the
missionaries
the
cholera
now
raged
around
them
with
fearful
violence
and
there
were
rumors
of
war
between
england
and
burmah
six
months
had
passed
and
still
the
fate
of
judson
was
a
fearful
mystery
the
english
vessels
were
hastening
their
departure
from
the
harbor
and
soon
they
would
have
no
means
of
leaving
the
country
whatever
might
occur
judson
writes
hough
has
been
for
some
time
past
desirous
to
have
hough
his
children
and
myself
go
to
bengal
but
i
have
ever
felt
resolved
not
to
make
any
movement
till
i
hear
from
judson
within
a
few
days
however
some
circumstances
have
occurred
which
have
induced
me
to
make
preparations
for
a
voyage
there
is
but
one
remaining
ship
in
the
river
and
if
an
embargo
is
laid
on
english
ships
it
will
be
impossible
for
judson
if
he
is
yet
alive
to
return
to
this
place
but
the
uncertainty
of
meeting
him
in
bengal
and
the
possibility
of
his
arriving
in
my
absence
cause
me
to
make
preparations
with
a
heavy
heart
sometimes
i
feel
inclined
to
remain
here
alone
and
hazard
the
consequences
i
should
certainly
conclude
on
this
step
if
any
probability
existed
of
judson
return
this
mission
has
never
appeared
in
so
low
a
state
as
at
the
present
time
it
seems
now
entirely
destroyed
as
we
all
expect
to
embark
for
bengal
in
a
day
or
two
alas
how
changed
are
our
prospects
since
judson
left
us
how
dark
how
intricate
the
providence
that
now
surrounds
us
yet
it
becomes
us
to
be
still
and
know
that
he
is
god
who
has
thus
ordered
our
circumstances
a
fortnight
later
she
writes
alone
my
dear
friends
in
this
great
house
i
take
my
pen
to
record
the
strange
vicissitudes
through
which
i
have
passed
within
a
few
days
on
the
of
this
month
i
embarked
with
hough
and
family
for
bengal
having
previously
disposed
of
what
i
could
not
take
with
me
my
disinclination
to
proceed
had
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
giving
up
the
voyage
but
my
passage
was
paid
my
baggage
on
board
and
i
knew
not
how
to
separate
myself
from
the
rest
of
the
mission
family
the
vessel
however
was
several
days
in
going
down
the
river
and
before
putting
out
to
sea
was
to
be
detained
a
day
or
two
longer
at
its
mouth
i
immediately
resolved
on
giving
up
the
voyage
and
returning
to
town
accordingly
the
captain
sent
up
a
boat
with
me
and
agreed
to
forward
my
baggage
the
next
day
i
reached
town
in
the
evening
spent
the
night
at
the
house
of
the
only
remaining
englishman
in
the
place
and
have
come
out
to
the
to
the
great
joy
of
all
the
burmans
left
on
our
premises
hough
and
his
family
will
proceed
and
they
kindly
and
affectionately
urge
my
return
i
know
i
am
surrounded
by
dangers
on
every
hand
and
expect
to
see
much
anxiety
and
distress
but
at
present
i
am
tranquil
and
intend
to
make
an
effort
to
pursue
my
studies
as
formerly
and
leave
the
event
with
god
thus
did
this
heroic
woman
with
that
divine
instinct
that
seems
to
guide
the
noblest
natures
in
great
emergencies
decide
to
return
alone
to
the
there
to
await
the
return
of
her
husband
or
the
confirmation
of
her
worst
fears
concerning
his
fate
it
was
a
wonderful
exhibition
of
courage
and
constancy
and
gave
assurance
of
all
the
distinguished
qualities
which
at
a
later
period
and
amid
dangers
still
more
appalling
shone
with
such
brightness
around
the
character
of
this
remarkable
woman
the
event
justified
her
determination
and
within
a
week
after
her
decision
was
taken
judson
arrived
at
rangoon
having
been
driven
from
place
to
place
by
contrary
winds
and
having
entirely
failed
of
the
object
for
which
he
undertook
the
voyage
and
hough
after
long
delays
reached
bengal
carrying
with
them
the
press
and
all
the
implements
of
the
their
removal
was
subsequently
productive
of
many
embarrassments
to
the
mission
and
seems
never
to
have
been
fully
justified
either
by
judson
or
the
board
of
managers

with
their

had
been

they
were

of
good
talents
fervent

extraordinary
devotion
to
the
object
of
evangelizing
the
heathen
judson
considering
himself
sufficiently
master
of
the
language
to
preach
publicly
decided
to
build
a
small
zayat
on
a
much
frequented
road
where
he
could
preach
the
gospel
and
converse
with
any
native
who
might
desire
it
and
where
judson
could
meet
female
inquirers
and
hold
a
school
for
religious
and
other
instruction
he
knew
that
this
might
draw
upon
them
the
displeasure
of
the
higher
powers
which
had
hitherto
favored
them
because
of
the
privacy
of
their
life
and
their
small
influence
with
the
natives
for
this
government

afterwards
discovered

remarkably
tolerant

foreigners

highly
intolerant

foreigners
of
every
description
are
allowed
the
fullest
exercise
of
their
religion
they
may
build
places
of
worship
in
any
place
and
have
their
public
festivals
and
processions
without
molestation
but
no
burman
may
join
any
of
these
religions
under
the
severest
penalties
in
nothing
does
the
government
more
thoroughly
display
its
despotism
than
in
its
measures
for
suppressing
all
religious
innovation
and
supporting
the
established
system
the
whole
population
is
thus
held
in
chains
as
as
caste
itself
and
to
become
a
christian
openly
is
to
hazard
everything
even
life
itself
but
the
missionaries
not
being
at
this
time
at
all
aware
of
the
rigor
of
this
intolerance
resolved
to
make
the
attempt
and
trust
in
the
lord
for
protection
in
april
judson
preached
in
his
new
zayat
to
a
congregation
of
fifteen
or
twenty
persons
most
of
them
entirely
inattentive
and
disorderly
but
feeble
as
was
this
beginning
it
was
regarded
by
the
missionaries
as
an
event
of
no
ordinary
importance
here
was
the
first
altar
ever
erected
for
the
worship
of
the
true
god
in
that
country
over
which
century
after
century
had
rolled
each
sweeping
its
millions
of
idolaters
into
eternity
and
rude
and
lowly
as
were
its
walls
compared
with
the
magnificent
temples
that
surrounded
it
it
was
perhaps
the
fitter
emblem
of
that
spiritual
religion
which
delights
not
in
temples
made
with
hands
but
in
the
service
of
the
heart
is
in
the
sight
of
god
of
great
price
the
building
which
they
called
a
from
its
similarity
to
the
public
buildings
of
that
name
in
burmah
had
three
apartments
the
first
a
mere
verandah
thatched
with
bamboo
open
to
the
road
and
the
place
where
judson
received
all
occasional
visitors
and
inquirers
the
second
or
middle
one
a
large
airy
room
occupied
on
sundays
for
preaching
and
on
week
days
as
a
and
the
last
division
a
mere
entry
opening
into
the
garden
leading
to
the
during
the
week
judson
occupied
the
middle
room
giving
instruction
in
reading
to
a
class
of
males
and
females
and
also
in
conversing
with
female
inquirers
here
she
also
studied
the
siamese
language
much
spoken
in
rangoon
and
translated
into
that
language
a
catechism
and
the
gospel
of
matthew
the
of
april
was
made
memorable
by
the
first
visit
of
an
inquirer
who
became
a
convert
to
the
christian
faith
on
the
of
may
judson
says
in
his
journal
it
seems
almost
too
much
to
believe
that
god
has
begun
to
manifest
his
grace
to
the
burmans
but
this
day
i
could
not
resist
the
delightful
conviction
that
this
is
really
the
case
praise
and
glory
to
his
name
for
evermore
amen
from
this
time
we
learn
from
judson
journal
that
the
verandah
of
the
zayat
where
he
sat
to
receive
visitors
was
constantly
thronged
with
natives
who
impelled
some
by
curiosity
and
idleness
and
some
by
better
motives
came
to
talk
about
the
new
religion
so
much
however
was
to
be
dreaded
in
the
opinion
of
most
of
these
from
the
lord
of
life
and
death
as
they
called
the
emperor
that
few
dared
follow
out
their
convictions
moung
nau
however
the
convert
above
mentioned
adhered
steadfastly
to
his
now
faith
and
desired
baptism
not
having
any
doubt
of
the
reality
of
his
conversion
judson
administered
the
ordinance
to
him
on
sunday
june
on
the
following
lord
day
the
missionaries
had
the
unspeakable
satisfaction
of
sitting
down
at
the
lord
table
for
the
first
time
with
a
converted
burman
and
as
judson
writes
he
had
the
privilege
to
which
he
had
been
looking
forward
many
years
of
administering
the
communion
in
two
languages
many
of
the
expressions
of
this
young
convert
are
very
interesting
we
find
them
in
a
letter
from
judson
in
our
religion
there
is
no
way
to
escape
the
punishment
due
to
sin
but
according
to
the
religion
of
christ
he
himself
has
died
in
order
to
deliver
his
disciples
how
great
are
my
thanks
to
jesus
christ
for
sending
teachers
to
this
country
and
how
great
are
my
thanks
to
the
teachers
for
coming
on
hearing
the
fifth
chapter
of
matthew
read
he
said
these
words
take
hold
on
my
very
heart
they
make
me
tremble
here
god
commands
us
to
do
everything
that
is
good
in
secret
and
not
to
be
seen
of
men
how
unlike
our
religion
is
this
when
burmans
make
offerings
to
the
pagodas
they
make
a
great
noise
with
drums
and
musical
instruments
that
others
may
see
how
good
they
are
but
this
religion
makes
the
mind
fear
god
it
makes
it
of
its
own
accord
fear
sin
in
the
same
letter
she
mentions
a
very
interesting
meeting
with
the
females
before
mentioned
fifteen
in
number
who
had
for
some
time
received
from
her
religious
instruction
their
love
for
and
confidence
in
their
own
religion
seemed
to
be
taken
away
the
truth
seemed
to
have
forced
itself
upon
their
understandings
but
the
sinfulness
of
their
hearts
which
among
heathen
as
well
as
christian
nations
is
the
great
obstacle
to
salvation
could
only
be
removed
by
the
holy
spirit
and
oh
how
earnest
and
fervent
were
the
prayers
of
their
teacher
for
the
presence
of
that
heavenly
agent
wheelock
one
of
the
recently
arrived
missionaries
was
obliged
on
account
of
his
failing
health
to
try
a
but
during
the
passage
to
bengal
in
a
paroxysm
of
fever
and
delirium
he
threw
himself
overboard
and
was
drowned
some
of
the
inquirers
at
the
zayat
had
no
inconsiderable
powers
of
reasoning
and
argument
one
in
particular
named
who
would
spend
whole
days
at
the
zayat
and
engage
judson
in
endless
not
satisfied
with
the
buddhist
faith
he
had
become
a
confirmed
skeptic
and
disputed
every
gospel
truth
before
he
received
it
with
much
subtilty
and
ingenuity
but
after
a
while
he
found
that
his
visits
at
the
zayat
had
attracted
the
notice
of
government
that
the
viceroy
on
being
told
he
had
renounced
the
religion
of
his
country
had
said
further
about
him
and
the
missionaries
for
a
time
saw
him
no
more
the
two
candidates
that
next
presented
themselves
for
baptism
were
urgent
that
the
ordinance
should
be
performed
not
absolutely
in
private
but
at
sunset
and
away
from
public
observation
the
missionaries
discussed
their
case
long
with
them
and
with
each
other
judson
remarks
on
the
subject
as
well
as
his
description
of
the
baptism
are
so
full
of
that
tenderness
and
pathos
which
is
eminently
a
of
the
spirit
that
we
must
give
them
in
his
own
words
we
felt
satisfied
that
they
were
humble
disciples
of
jesus
and
were
desirous
of
receiving
this
ordinance
purely
out
of
regard
to
his
command
and
their
own
spiritual
welfare
we
felt
that
we
were
all
equally
exposed
to
danger
and
needed
a
spirit
of
mutual
candor
and
forbearance
and
sympathy
we
were
convinced
that
they
were
influenced
rather
by
desires
of
avoiding
unnecessary
exposure
than
by
that
sinful
fear
which
would
plunge
them
into
apostasy
in
the
hour
of
trial
and
when
they
assured
us
that
if
actually
brought
before
government
they
could
not
think
of
denying
their
saviour
we
could
not
conscientiously
refuse
their
request
and
therefore
agreed
to
have
them
baptized
at
sunset
lord
day
we
had
worship
as
usual
and
the
people
dispersed
about
half
an
hour
before
sunset
the
two
candidates
came
to
the
zayat
accompanied
by
three
or
four
of
their
friends
and
after
a
short
prayer
we
proceeded
to
the
spot
where
was
formerly
baptized
the
sun
was
not
allowed
to
look
on
the
humble
timid
profession
no
wondering
crowd
crowned
the
overshadowing
hill
no
hymn
of
praise
expressed
the
exulting
feeling
of
joyous
hearts
stillness
and
solemnity
pervaded
the
scene
we
felt
on
the
banks
of
the
water
as
a
little
feeble
solitary
band
but
perhaps
some
hovering
angels
took
note
of
the
event
with
more
interest
than
they
witnessed
the
late
coronation
perhaps
jesus
looked
down
on
us
pitied
and
forgave
our
weaknesses
and
marked
us
for
his
own
perhaps
if
we
deny
him
not
he
will
acknowledge
us
another
day
more
publicly
than
we
venture
at
present
to
acknowledge
him
there
was
a
great
falling
off
in
the
attendance
at
the
zayat
after
defection
none
dared
call
to
inquire
from
religious
principle
and
curiosity
respecting
the
religion
had
been
fully
gratified
it
became
highly
desirable
to
take
some
measures
to
secure
the
favor
of
the
emperor
if
he
could
be
made
propitious
the
converts
and
the
missionaries
would
have
nothing
to
fear
judson
and
colman
therefore
leaving
their
families
at
rangoon
set
out
on
their
visit
to
ava
to
lay
their
case
as
a
burman
would
express
it
before
golden
feet
they
carried
with
them
as
presents
to
his
majesty
the
bible
in
six
volumes
covered
with
gold
leaf
in
the
burman
style
each
volume
enclosed
in
a
rich
wrapper
and
many
other
articles
as
presents
to
the
different
members
of
the
government
chapter
xi
reception
of
colman
and
judson
at
their
return
to
their
resolution
to
leave
opposition
of
disciples
to
this
increase
of
their
failure
of
judson
health
the
passage
up
the
irrawaddy
to
ava
or
rather
amerapoora
which
was
then
the
capital
was
made
in
safety
in
a
little
more
than
thirty
days
they
soon
found
the
house
of
their
old
friend
the
former
viceroy
of
rangoon
who
now
enjoyed
a
high
post
under
government
here
they
were
kindly
received
and
promised
a
speedy
presentation
to
the
golden
face
the
emperor
the
next
day
moung
yo
a
favorite
officer
of
the
viceroy
came
to
take
them
to
the
imperial
palace
he
first
introduced
them
to
the
private
minister
of
state
who
met
them
very
pleasantly
received
their
presents
and
a
petition
they
had
prepared
to
the
emperor
which
latter
he
was
examining
when
some
one
announced
that
the
foot
was
about
to
advance
when
the
minister
hastily
rose
up
put
on
his
and
prepared
to
present
them
to
the
emperor
they
were
conducted
through
various
splendor
and
parade
up
a
flight
of
steps
into
a
magnificent
hall
judson
says
the
scene
to
which
we
were
now
introduced
really
surpassed
our
expectation
the
spacious
extent
of
the
hall
the
number
and
magnitude
of
the
pillars
the
height
of
the
dome
the
whole
completely
covered
with
gold
presented
a
most
grand
and
imposing
spectacle
very
few
were
present
and
those
evidently
great
officers
of
state
our
situation
prevented
us
from
seeing
the
further
avenue
of
the
hall
but
the
end
where
we
sat
opened
into
the
parade
which
the
emperor
was
about
to
inspect
we
remained
about
five
minutes
when
every
one
put
himself
into
the
most
respectful
attitude
and
moung
yo
whispered
that
his
majesty
had
entered
we
looked
through
the
hall
as
far
as
the
pillars
would
allow
and
presently
caught
sight
of
this
modern
ahasuerus
he
came
forward
unattended
in
solitary
grandeur
exhibiting
the
proud
gait
and
majesty
of
an
eastern
monarch
his
dress
was
rich
but
not
distinctive
and
he
carried
in
his
hand
the
sword
which
seems
to
have
taken
the
place
of
the
sceptre
of
ancient
times
but
it
was
his
high
aspect
and
commanding
eye
that
chiefly
rivetted
our
attention
he
strided
on
every
head
excepting
ours
was
now
in
the
dust
we
remained
kneeling
our
hands
folded
our
eyes
fixed
on
the
monarch
when
he
drew
near
we
caught
his
attention
he
stopped
partly
turned
towards
us
are
these
teachers
great
king
i
replied
you
speak
burman
the
priests
that
i
heard
of
last
night
when
did
you
arrive
are
you
teachers
of
religion
are
you
married
why
do
you
dress
so
these
and
other
similar
questions
we
answered
when
he
appeared
to
be
pleased
with
us
and
sat
down
on
an
elevated
seat
his
hand
resting
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
his
eyes
intently
fixed
on
us
moung
zah
now
read
their
petition
which
set
forth
that
they
were
teachers
of
the
religion
of
their
country
and
begged
the
royal
permission
to
teach
the
same
in
his
dominions
and
also
prayed
that
no
burman
might
be
subjected
to
molestation
from
government
for
listening
to
or
embracing
that
religion
and
the
emperor
after
hearing
it
took
it
himself
read
it
through
and
handed
it
back
without
saying
a
word
in
the
meantime
judson
had
given
moung
zah
an
abridged
copy
of
the
tract
called
a
summary
of
christian
doctrine
which
had
been
got
up
in
the
richest
style
and
dress
possible
the
emperor
took
the
tract
our
hearts
says
now
rose
to
god
for
a
display
of
his
grace
oh
have
mercy
on
burmah
have
mercy
on
her
king
but
alas
the
time
had
not
yet
come
he
held
the
tract
long
enough
to
read
the
two
first
sentences
which
assert
that
there
is
one
eternal
god
who
is
independent
of
the
incidents
of
mortality
and
that
besides
him
there
is
no
god
and
then
with
an
air
of
indifference
perhaps
disdain
he
dashed
it
down
to
the
ground
moung
zah
stooped
forward
picked
it
up
and
handed
it
to
us
moung
yo
made
a
slight
attempt
to
save
us
by
unfolding
one
of
the
volumes
which
composed
our
present
and
displaying
its
beauty
but
his
majesty
took
no
notice
our
fate
was
decided
after
a
few
moments
moung
zah
interpreted
his
royal
master
will
in
the
following
terms
in
regard
to
the
objects
of
your
petition
his
majesty
gives
no
order
in
regard
to
your
sacred
books
his
majesty
has
no
use
for
them
take
them
away
he
then
rose
from
his
seat
strode
on
to
the
end
of
the
hall
and
there
after
having
dashed
to
the
ground
the
first
intelligence
he
had
ever
received
of
the
eternal
god
his
maker
preserver
his
judge
he
threw
himself
down
on
a
cushion
and
lay
listening
to
the
music
and
gazing
at
the
parade
spread
out
before
him
they
and
their
presents
were
then
hurried
away
with
little
ceremony
the
next
day
they
ascertained
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
policy
of
the
burman
government
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
chinese
that
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
whether
any
subjects
of
the
emperor
who
embrace
a
religion
different
from
his
own
will
be
exempt
from
punishment
and
that
we
in
presenting
a
petition
to
that
effect
had
been
guilty
of
a
most
egregious
blunder
an
unpardonable
offence
we
can
not
prevail
on
ourselves
to
give
the
sequel
of
this
narrative
in
any
other
than
the
beautiful
and
picturesque
language
of
judson
which
we
have
so
often
quoted
it
was
now
evening
we
had
four
miles
to
walk
by
moonlight
two
of
our
disciples
only
followed
us
they
had
pressed
as
near
as
they
ventured
to
the
door
of
the
hall
of
audience
and
listened
to
words
which
sealed
the
extinction
of
their
hopes
and
ours
for
some
time
we
spoke
not
natural
tears
we
dropped
but
wiped
them
soon
tho
world
was
all
before
us
where
to
choose
our
place
of
rest
and
providence
our
guide
and
as
our
first
parents
took
their
solitary
way
through
eden
so
we
took
our
way
through
this
great
city
arrived
at
the
boat
we
threw
ourselves
down
exhausted
in
body
and
mind
for
three
days
we
had
walked
eight
miles
a
day
the
most
of
the
way
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
which
in
the
interior
of
these
countries
is
exceedingly
oppressive
and
the
result
of
our
toils
and
travels
has
been
the
wisest
and
best
possible
a
result
which
if
we
could
see
the
end
from
the
beginning
would
call
forth
our
highest
praise
o
slow
of
heart
to
believe
and
trust
in
the
agency
of
our
own
almighty
saviour
they
returned
to
rangoon
by
an
easy
and
rapid
passage
down
the
river
and
calling
the
few
disciples
together
frankly
disclosed
to
them
the
result
of
their
mission
to
their
surprise
and
delight
it
only
increased
their
zeal
and
attachment
for
the
religion
they
had
professed
they
became
in
turn
the
comforters
of
the
missionaries
vieing
with
each
other
in
trying
to
convince
them
that
the
cause
was
not
yet
desperate
above
all
were
they
solicitous
that
the
missionaries
should
not
carry
out
a
design
they
had
formed
to
leave
them
and
try
to
find
a
field
more
favorable
for
their
labors
one
assured
them
he
would
follow
them
to
the
end
of
the
world
another
who
having
an
unconverted
wife
could
not
follow
them
declared
that
if
left
there
alone
he
would
perform
no
other
duties
but
those
of
christ
religion
but
what
had
most
weight
with
and
judson
in
inducing
them
to
remain
was
the
fact
that
inquiry
seemed
to
be
spreading
in
the
neighborhood
and
that
there
seemed
a
further
prospect
of
usefulness
in
spite
of
the
fear
of
persecution
they
therefore
concluded
to
remain
for
the
present
at
rangoon
while
and
colman
should
proceed
to
arracan
and
form
a
station
there
thus
again
were
and
alone
but
not
now
exclusively
among
heathen
idolaters
the
affectionate
zeal
of
the
disciples
rejoiced
their
hearts
and
others
and
among
them
the
old
disputant
seemed
sincere
and
hopeful
inquirers
three
women
induced
by
him
also
visited
judson
to
learn
the
way
of
life
one
of
these
the
one
we
have
before
alluded
to
was
characterized
by
superior
discernment
and
mental
power
but
exceedingly
timid
through
fear
of
persecution
in
one
of
her
conversations
she
expressed
her
surprise
that
the
effect
of
the
religion
of
christ
upon
her
mind
was
to
make
her
love
his
disciples
more
than
her
dearest
natural
relations
this
showed
that
she
was
a
real
disciple
though
a
timid
one
but
surely
it
is
not
for
us
who
sit
under
our
own
vine
with
none
to
make
us
afraid
to
be
severe
on
these
poor
heathen
for
not
at
once
overcoming
the
dread
of
suffering
so
natural
to
the
human
heart
before
we
judge
them
let
us
be
very
sure
that
faith
would
endure
the
fires
of
persecution
and
even
of
martyrdom
which
threatened
them
they
knew
of
instances
where
their
countrymen
who
had
embraced
the
faith
had
been
subjected
to
the
punishment
of
the
an
instrument
of
torture
more
dreadful
than
any
employed
against
the
scottish
covenanters
in
the
times
of
their
bitterest
persecution
sudden
execution
they
might
have
braved
though
that
will
appal
almost
any
heart
but
lingering
torture
was
what
they
might
fear
to
which
death
should
succeed
only
when
nature
could
bear
no
more
females
in
christian
countries
who
think
much
of
your
and
sacrifices
when
moment
pain
a
passing
shower
is
all
the
grief
ye
share
how
could
hearts
endure
if
called
to
such
trials
as
might
at
any
moment
befall
your
poor
sisters
in

had
for
some
time
been
failing
and
at
length

having
gone
through
two
courses
of
salivation
for
the
she
was
obliged
to
try
a
her
situation
was
too
critical
for
her
to
think
of
going
alone
and
judson
concluded
to
accompany
her
to
bengal
two
converts
expressed
the
strongest
desire
to
profess
christ
before
the
missionaries
should
leave
them
they
were
accordingly
baptized
the
ship
being
detained
the
speculative
hesitating
but
now
sincere
disciple
moung
casting
aside
his
fears
and
scruples
boldly
avowed
his
faith
and
desired
baptism
of
course
he
was
joyfully
received
the
scene
at
his
baptism
had
such
an
effect
upon
mah
meulah
the
female
who
has
been
before
mentioned
that
she
too
could
no
longer
delay
a
public
profession
of
faith
in
christ
on
returning
to
the
house
after
receiving
the
rite
she
said
now
i
have
taken
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
jesus
christ
and
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
commit
myself
soul
and
body
into
the
hands
of
my
lord
assured
that
he
will
never
suffer
me
to
fall
away
surely
if
no
other
proof
existed
of
the
power
of
gospel
truth
to
renew
the
heart
of
men
a
sufficient
one
would
be
furnished
here
in
the
face
of
threatened
persecution
not
only
were
old
converts
strengthened
in
their
faith
in
and
attachment
to
christ
but
new
ones
eagerly
pressed
forward
to
unite
themselves
with
the
despised
and
humble
flock
nine
males
and
one
female
had
now
been
baptized
at
the
hazard
of
their
lives
a
grammar
and
dictionary
had
been
compiled
and
printed
a
portion
of
the
scriptures
translated
and
printed
tracts
had
been
issued
and
so
greatly
had
the
missionaries
gained
in
favor
with
the
people
that
as
they
went
down
to
the
ship
which
was
to
carry
them
to

more
than

followed

the
converts
received

with

affection

and
welcomed

with

inquirers
presented
themselves
at
the

in
translating
the
scriptures
the
acute
and
fertile
mind
of
moung
was
an
invaluable
assistance
while
another
convert
of
cultivated
intellect
was
equally
useful
in
other
missionary
labors

through
fear
of
being
subjected
to
extortion

of

that
time

sure
of
toleration
under
the
name
of

viceroy
the
history
of
the
next
few
months
presents
nothing
novel
in
the
life
of
this
little
christian
community
to
which
there
were
however
some
accessions
but
judson
was
gradually
sinking
under
the
disease
which
had
so
long
troubled
her
until
at
length
it
was
found
essential
to
her
even
that
she
should
seek
some
more
propitious
climate
after
much
anxious
deliberation
it
was
resolved
that
she
should
sail
for

and
thence
to
america
her
feelings
on
leaving
the
of
her
heart
and
the
husband
of
her
youth
as
well
as
the
spiritual
children
that
god
had
given
them
in
that
heathen
land
to
try
alone
the
perils
of
a
long
and
tedious
voyage
in
a
state
of
health
which
rendered
it
doubtful
whether
she
would
ever
reach
the
land
of
her
nativity
or
return
to
that
of
her
adoption
can
scarcely
be
conceived
much
less
described
her
own
words
are
those
only
who
have
been
through
a
variety
of
toil
and
privation
to
obtain
a
darling
object
can
realize
how
entirely
every
fibre
of
the
heart
adheres
to
that
object
when
secured
had
we
encountered
no
difficulties
and
suffered
no
privations
in
our
attempts
to
form
a
church
of
christ
under
the
government
of
a
heathen
despot
we
should
have
been
warmly
attached
to
the
individuals
composing
it
but
should
not
have
felt
that
tender
solicitude
and
anxious
affection
as
in
the
present
case
rangoon
from
having
been
the
theatre
in
which
so
much
of
the
power
faithfulness
and
mercy
of
god
have
been
exhibited
from
having
been
considered
for
ten
years
past
as
my
home
for
life
and
from
a
thousand
interesting
associations
had
become
the
dearest
spot
on
earth
hence
you
will
readily
imagine
that
no
ordinary
consideration
would
have
induced
my
departure
she
arrived
in
calcutta
finding
when
she
reached
there
that
the
american
captains
of
vessels
declined
taking
passengers
without
an
exorbitant
price
she
decided
not
to
take
passage
to
america
on
mentioning
her
circumstances
to
a
lady
in
calcutta
the
latter
strongly
recommended
the
advantages
of
a
voyage
to
england
on
account
of
the
superior
accommodations
medical
advice
and
female
passengers
in
english
ships
a
pious
captain
offered
to
take
her
for
about
one
third
of
the
price
demanded
for
a
voyage
to
america
provided
she
would
share
a
cabin
with
three
children
who
were
going
to
england
an
offer
which
she
immediately
accepted
the
father
of
the
children
subsequently
arrived
in
calcutta
and
generously
paid
the
whole
price
of
the
cabin
which
enabled
her
to
go
without
any
expense
to
the
board
she
writes
if
the
pain
in
my
side
is
entirely
removed
while
on
my
passage
to
europe
i
shall
return
to
india
in
the
same
ship
and
proceed
immediately
to
rangoon
but
if
not
i
shall
go
over
to
america
and
spend
one
winter
in
my
dear
native
country
ardently
as
i
desire
to
see
my
beloved
friends
in
america
i
can
not
prevail
on
myself
to
be
any
longer
from
rangoon
than
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
my
life
i
have
had
a
severe
struggle
relative
to
my
immediate
return
to
rangoon
instead
of
going
to
england
but
i
did
not
venture
to
go
contrary
to
the
convictions
of
reason
to
the
opinion
of
an
eminent
and
skilful
physician
and
the
repeated
injunctions
of
judson
my
last
letter
from
rangoon
was
dated
moung
had
been
accused
before
the
viceroy
and
had
disappeared
judson
had
felt
much
anxiety
and
distress
on
his
account
fearing
he
had
done
something
in
the
way
of
retraction
which
prevented
his
visiting
him
but
in
a
fortnight
he
was
agreeably
surprised
at
seeing
him
enter
he
informed
that
having
been
accused
he
had
thought
it
the
wisest
way
to
keep
out
of
sight
that
he
had
put
all
his
family
on
board
a
boat
and
was
going
up
the
country
among
the
sect
of
heretics
with
whom
he
once
associated
and
had
now
come
to
take
leave
obtain
tracts
gospels
judson
furnished
him
with
what
was
necessary
and
bid
him
god
speed
he
will
no
doubt
do
much
good
among
that
class
of
people
for
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
be
any
time
with
his
friends
without
conversing
on
the
subject
of
religion
moung
ing
had
returned
as
steadfast
and
as
much
devoted
to
the
cause
as
ever
he
and
moung
spend
every
evening
in
reading
the
scriptures
and
finding
the
places
where
the
apostles
preached
on
a
map
which
judson
has
made
for
them
another
burman
has
been
baptized
who
gives
decided
evidence
of
being
a
true
christian
have
we
not
my
dear
sir
every
reason
to
trust
god
in
future
when
we
see
what
he
has
done
in
rangoon
could
you
see
at
once
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
the
conversion
of
the
burmans
the
grace
of
god
would
appear
ten
times
as
conspicuous
as
it
now
does
when
we
hardly
ventured
to
hope
that
we
should
ever
see
one
of
them
truly
converted
how
great
is
our
joy
to
see
a
little
church
rise
up
in
the
midst
of
that
wilderness
consisting
of
thirteen
converted
burmans
on
her
passage
to
england
her
old
enemy

again
attacked
her
but
bodily
illness
did
not
prevent
her
from
endeavoring
to
benefit
the
souls
of
her
and
with
regard
to
two
of
them
her
efforts
did
not
seem
unsuccessful
on
arriving
in
england
she
was
cordially
invited
by
the
hon
joseph
butterworth
to
make
his
house
her
home
he
afterward
at
a
public
meeting
referred
to
her
visit
as
reminding
him
of
the
apostolic
admonition
not
forgetful
to
entertain
strangers
for
thereby
some
have
entertained
angels
unawares
at
his
house
she
met
many
persons
distinguished
for
literature
and
piety
among
whom
were
sumner
babington
and
wilberforce
after
spending
some
time
at
cheltenham
to
which
place
she
had
been
sent
for
the
benefit
of
its
waters
she
accepted
a
pressing
invitation
to
visit
scotland
where
as
in
england
she
received
valuable
presents
and
innumerable
acts
of
kindness
the
piety
of
her
english
friends
seemed
to
her
of
the
most
character
and
their
ardent
friendship
called
forth
her
warmest
affections
though
on
her
way
to
a
still
dearer
country
the
land
of
her
birth
she
could
not
part
with
them
without
the
tenderest
regret

the

on

of

prudence

accordingly
i
embarked
on

for

where
i
arrived
a

it
was
my
intention
to
pass
a

in

and
then
go
to
providence
and
thence
to
you
in

as
it
would
be
on

i
shall
spend

wishes
me
to
go

which
will
detain
me
in
this
part
of
the
country
a
week
longer
however
i
hope
to
be
with
you
in
a
fortnight
from
this
time
my
health
is
much
improved
since
i
left
england
and
i
begin
to
hope
the
disorder
is
entirely
eradicated
of
this
visit
of
judson
to
america
professor
gammell
remarks
in
general
as
follows
her
visit
to
the
united
states
forms
an
epoch
of
no
inconsiderable
importance
in
the
progress
of
interest
in
missions
among
the
churches
of
various
denominations
in
this
country
she
visited
several
of
the
leading
cities
of
the
union
met
a
large
number
of
associations
of
ladies
attended
the
session
of
the
triennial
convention
at
washington
and
in
a
multitude
of
social
circles
alike
in
the
south
and
in
the
north
recited
the
thrilling
narrative
of
what
she
had
seen
and
experienced
during
the
eventful
years
in
which
she
had
dwelt
in
a
heathen
land
but
relaxation
and
travelling
for
health
and
interviews
with
religious
friends
were
not
her
only
occupation
in
her
retirement
in
addition
to
maintaining
an
extensive
correspondence
she
found
time
to
prepare
the
history
of
the
mission
in
burmah
which
was
published
in
her
name
in
a
series
of
letters
addressed
to
butterworth
the
gentleman
beneath
whose
roof
she
had
been
a
guest
during
her
residence
in
england
these
records
which
were
principally
compiled
from
documents
which
had
been
published
before
contained
the
first
continuous
account
of
the
burman
mission
ever
given
to
the
public
the
work
was
widely
read
in
england
and
america
and
received
the
favorable
notice
of
several
of
the
leading
organs
of
public
criticism
the
influence
which
she
exerted
in
favor
of
the
cause
of
missions
during
her
brief
residence
of
eight
or
nine
months
in
the
united
states
it
is
hardly
possible
now
to
estimate
she
enlisted
more
fully
in
the
cause
not
a
few
leading
minds
who
have
since
rendered
it
signal
service
both
by
eloquent
vindications
and
by
judicious
counsels
and
by
the
appeals
which
she
addressed
to
christians
of
her
own
sex
and
her
fervid
conversations
with
persons
of
all
classes
and
denominations
in
america
as
well
as
by
the
views
which
she
submitted
to
the
managers
of
the
mission
a
new
zeal
for
its
prosecution
was
everywhere
created
and
the
missionary
enterprise
instead
of
being
regarded
with
doubt
and
misgiving
as
it
had
been
by
many
even
among
christians
began
to
be
understood
in
its
higher
relations
to
all
the
hopes
of
man
and
to
be
contemplated
in
its
true
grandeur
and
ennobling
moral
dignity
such
is
the
opinion
of
her
visit
expressed
by
an
elegant
and
enlightened
scholar
now
that
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
has
passed
bringing
triumph
to
the
missionary
cause
and
honor
to
its
first
founders
and
advocates
but
such
we
regret
to
say
was
not
the
universal
sentiment
of
her
contemporaries
many
persons
well
remember
the
unfounded
stories
put
in
circulation
respecting
her
by
some
whose
motives
we
will
not
inquire
into
as
they
would
scarcely
bear
investigation
in
regard
to
her
actions
her
intentions
and
even
her
apparel
as
her
biographer
remarks
in
introducing
some
of
her
letters
at
this
period
it
was
said
that
her
health
was
not
seriously
impaired
and
that
she
visited
the
south
with
a
view
to
excite
attention
and
applause
to
persons
who
would
put
forth
or
circulate
such
calumnies
a
perusal
of
her
letters
in
which
she
utters
her
feelings
to
her
friends
without
reserve
will
it
is
hoped
minister
a
rebuke
sufficiently
severe
to
awaken
shame
and
penitence
and
to
those
who
may
unwarily
have
been
led
to
form
unfavorable
opinions
respecting
judson
we
can
not
doubt
that
these
letters
will
afford
welcome
evidence
of
her
modest
and
amiable
disposition
consistent
and
exemplary
demeanor
ardent
piety
and
steady
irrepressible
devotion
to
the
interests
of
the
mission
the
person
and
manners
of
judson
at
this
time
were
according
to
the
testimony
of
some
who
well
recollect
her
engaging
and
attractive
in
no
common
degree
her
sweet
and
ready
smile
her
dark
expressive
eye
the
animation
and
sprightliness
of
her
conversation
and
her
refined
taste
and
manners
made
her
a
favorite
in
all
circles
her
dress
for
which
she
was
indebted
to
the
liberality
of
british
friends
was
more
rich
and
showy
than
she
would
have
chosen
for
herself
and
as
has
been
said
excited
unkind
remarks
from
some
who
did
not
care
to
investigate
her
reasons
for
wearing
it
elegant
as
it
was
said
to
be
it
was
certainly
far
better
she
should
wear
it
even
at
the
risk
of
seeming
inconsistency
than
to
put
her
friends
to
the
expense
of
other
and
plainer
clothing
as
to
the
imputation
that
she
preferred
the
eclat
of
life
in
a
southern
city
to
the
retirement
of
her
new
england
home
it
is
sufficient
to
answer
that
a
constitution
relaxed
and
enfeebled
by
ten
residence
in
a
tropical
climate
was
to
bear
the
rigors
of
a
new
england
winter
and
as
her
whole
object
in
her
visit
was
the
restoration
of
her
health
she
conceived
it
her
duty
to
choose
such
a
place
of
sojourn
as
should
seem
most
favorable
to
it
after
a
stay
of
six
weeks
with
her
parents
in
bradford
found
it
necessary
to
seek
a
milder
climate
and
was
advised
to
try
that
of
baltimore
she
had
a
pleasant
journey
to
that
city
stopping
one
day
with
friends
in
new
york
and
arrived
there
on
the
of
december
from
her
letters
written
about
this
time
we
proceed
to
give
some
extracts
my
journey
to
this
place
was
pleasant
though
fatiguing
i
passed
one
night
only
in
new
york
and
spent
a
most
pleasant
evening
in
the
society
of
a
large
party
of
good
people
who
were
collected
for
the
purpose
of
prayer
many
fervent
petitions
were
presented
in
behalf
of
the
perishing
burmans
and
the
little
church
established
in
that
country
it
was
an
evening
to
me
full
of
interest
but
i
found
at
the
conclusion
that
my
strength
was
quite
exhausted
and
i
began
to
fear
whether
i
should
be
able
to
continue
my
journey
how
much
of
heaven
might
christians
enjoy
even
here
on
earth
if
they
would
keep
in
view
what
ought
to
be
their
great
object
in
life
if
they
would
but
make
the
enjoyment
of
god
their
main
pursuit
how
much
more
consistent
their
profession
would
be
with
their
conduct
how
much
more
useful
their
lives
and
how
much
more
rapidly
they
would
ripen
for
eternal
glory
christians
do
not
sufficiently
assist
one
another
in
their
spiritual
walk
they
are
not
enough
in
the
habit
of
conversing
familiarly
and
affectionately
on
the
state
of
each
others
souls
and
kindly
encouraging
each
other
to
persevere
and
get
near
to
heaven
one
degree
of
grace
attained
in
this
world
is
worth
more
than
every
earthly
enjoyment
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
that
i
found
much
of
the
true
missionary
spirit
existing
in
new
york
i
began
this
letter
some
days
ago
but
a
violent
cold
has
prevented
my
finishing
it
i
am
very
thankful
that
i
am
no
farther
north
than
baltimore
for
i
feel
confident
the
cold
would
soon
destroy
me
i
have
not
been
out
of
the
house
since
i
arrived
and
hardly
out
of
my
chamber
my
health
is
certainly
better
than
when
i
left
boston
though
i
have
a
heavy
cold
and
some
cough
what
can
be
done
to
excite
a
missionary
spirit
in
this
country
i
dare
not
engage
in
the
subject
till
i
am
better
it
would
take
up
my
whole
soul
and
retard
my
recovery
a
little
while
and
we
are
in
eternity
before
we
find
ourselves
there
let
us
do
for
christ

from
her
her
her
history
of
the
burman
her
departure
from
america
with
and
wade
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
at
waterville
judson
gives
a
full
account
of
the
reasons
that
determined
her
to
pass
the
winter
at
the
south
she
says
i
had
never
counted
the
cost
of
a
visit
to
my
native
country
and
beloved
relatives
i
did
not
expect
that
a
scene
which
i
had
anticipated
so
was
destined
to
give
my
health
and
constitution
a
shock
which
would
require
months
to
repair
during
my
passage
from
england
my
health
was
most
perfect
not
the
least
symptom
of
my
original
disorder
remained
but
from
the
day
of
my
arrival
the
idea
that
i
was
once
more
on
american
ground
banished
all
peace
and
quiet
from
my
mind
and
for
the
first
four
days
and
nights
i
never
closed
my
eyes
to
sleep
this
circumstance
together
with
dwelling
on
the
anticipated
meeting
with
my
friends
occasioned
the
most
alarming
apprehensions
i
reached
my
father
about
a
fortnight
after
my
arrival
in
the
country
and
had
not
then
been
able
to
procure
a
single
night
sleep
the
scene
which
ensued
brought
my
feelings
to
a
crisis
nature
was
quite
exhausted
and
i
began
to
fear
would
sink
to
be
concise
my
health
began
to
decline
in
a
most
alarming
manner
and
the
pain
in
my
side
and
cough
returned
i
was
kept
in
a
state
of
constant
excitement
by
daily
meeting
my
old
friends
and
acquaintances
and
during
the
whole
six
weeks
of
my
residence
at
my
father
i
had
night
quiet
rest
i
felt
the
cold
most
severely
and
found
as
that
increased
my
cough
increased
she
goes
on
to
say
that
under
these
circumstances
she
was
strongly
urged
by
judson
a
brother
of
her
husband
who
was
then
in
baltimore
to
remove
to
the
south
and
take
up
her
residence
for
the
winter
with
him
at
his
she
says
that
painful
as
it
was
to
leave
her
dear
family
yet
as
she
knew
that
freedom
from
company
and
excitement
as
well
as
a
milder
climate
were
absolutely
essential
to
her
recovery
she
was
induced
to
go
she
adds
that
her
health
is
so
far
that
she
is
able
to
give
five
hours
a
day
to
study
and
to
the
compilation
of
her
history
of
the
burman
mission
a
work
she
had
very
much
at
heart
the
next
passage
in
the
letter
is
of
touching
interest
as
showing
the
meekness
of
the
christian
spirit
in
receiving
a
rebuke
whether
merited
or
not
your
kind
hint
relative
to
my
being
injured
by
the
lavish
attention
of
our
dear
friends
in
this
country
has
much
endeared
you
to
my
heart
i
am
well
aware
that
human
applause
has
a
tendency
to
elate
the
soul
and
render
it
less
anxious
about
spiritual
enjoyments
particularly
if
the
individual
is
conscious
of
deserving
it
but
i
must
say
that
since
my
return
to
this
country
i
have
often
been
affected
to
tears
in
hearing
the
undeserved
praises
of
my
friends
feeling
that
i
was
far
very
far
from
being
what
they
imagined
and
that
there
are
thousands
of
poor
obscure
christians
whose
excellences
will
never
be
known
in
this
world
who
are
a
thousand
times
more
deserving
of
the
tender
regard
of
their
than
i
am
yet
i
trust
i
am
grateful
to
my
heavenly
father
for
inclining
the
hearts
of
his
children
to
look
on
me
with
a
friendly
eye
the
retired
life
i
now
lead
is
much
more
congenial
to
my
feelings
and
much
more
favorable
to
religious
enjoyment
than
when
i
was
kept
in
a
continual
bustle
of
company
yes
it
is
in
retirement
that
our
affections
are
raised
to
god
and
our
souls
refreshed
and
quickened
by
the
influences
of
the
holy
spirit
if
we
would
live
near
the
threshold
of
heaven
and
daily
take
a
glance
at
our
promised
inheritance
we
must
avoid
not
only
worldly
but
religious
dissipation
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
do
believe
there
is
something
like
religious
dissipation
in
a
christian
being
so
entirely
engrossed
in
religious
company
as
to
prevent
his
spiritual
enjoyments
in
baltimore
through
the
influence
of
judson
she
had
the
best
medical
advice
and
attendance
the
city
could
give
and
was
put
upon
a
course
of
mercury
in
order
to
produce
salivation
she
denied
herself
to
company
and
thus
secured
time
for
writing
in
which
employment
she
was
assisted
by
a
pious
excellent
young
lady
whom
she
engaged
as
a
copyist
her
correspondence
was
extensive
and
occupied
much
of
her
time
one
interesting
letter
from
england
informed
her
that
butterworth
had
put
at
interest
for
her
burman
school
sterling
and
that
a
larger
sum
had
been
collected
her
english
physicians
insisted
that
she
could
in
india
and
urged
her
and
her
husband
to
come
to
england
but
her
determination
to
return
to
burmah
was
unalterable
on
the
of
february
she
writes
to
her
friend
in
waterville
your
kind
and
affectionate
letter
found
me
in
bed
so
weak
that
i
was
obliged
to
read
it
at
intervals
but
it
afforded
heartfelt
consolation
thanks
to
our
heavenly
father
whose
guardian
care
and
love
i
have
experienced
i
am
now
much
better
and
once
more
enjoy
the
prospect
of
gaining
that
degree
of
health
which
will
allow
my
return
to
burmah
there
to
spend
my
remaining
days
few
or
many
in
endeavouring
to
guide
immortal
souls
to
that
dear
redeemer
whose
presence
can
make
joyful
a
sick
chamber
a
dying
bed
for
the
last
month
i
have
been
the
disease
seemed
to
be
removed
from
the
liver
to
the
lungs
i
have
raised
blood
twice
which
the
physicians
thought
proceeded
from
the
lungs
though
i
am
inclined
to
think
it
was
from
the
throat
i
was
however
bled
so
frequently
and
so
largely
that
my
strength
was
quite
reduced
at
present
i
am
free
from
every
unfavorable
symptom
but
am
still
weak
i
am
rejoiced
to
hear
that
boardman
has
offered
himself
to
supply
dear
colman
place
if
actuated
by
motives
of
love
to
god
and
concern
for
precious
souls
tell
him
he
will
never
regret
the
sacrifice
but
will
find
those
spiritual
consolations
which
will
more
than
compensate
him
for
every
privation
i
shall
rejoice
to
afford
him
every
assistance
in
the
acquisition
of
the
language
which
my
health
will
allow
though
i
fear
he
will
not
be
ready
to
sail
so
early
as
i
hope
to
embark
this
is
the
third
day
i
have
been
writing
this
letter
on
account
of
my
weakness
but
i
am
gaining
a
little
every
day
yesterday
i
had
a
little
female
in
my
chamber
trust
the
blessed
saviour
was
near
us
oh
it
is
good
to
get
near
to
god
and
feel
whether
in
life
or
death
we
are
his
let
us
my
dear
sister
so
live
that
our
union
to
christ
may
not
only
be
satisfactory
to
ourselves
but
to
all
around
us
on
earth
we
serve
god
in
heaven
enjoy
him
is
a
motto
i
have
long
wished
to
adopt
when
in
heaven
we
can
do
nothing
towards
saving
immortal
souls
in
a
subsequent
letter
she
mentions
receiving
a
journal
kept
by
her
husband
with
the
joyful
intelligence
of
the
accession
of
five
more
converts
to
the
little
church
there
three
of
whom
were
females
and
members
of
her
wednesday
meeting
they
have
she
says
set
up
of
their
own
accord
a
female
is
not
this
encouraging
price
had
been
ordered
to
ava
on
account
of
his
medical
skill
and
judson
was
about
to
accompany
him
to
make
a
further
effort
for
toleration
in
march
judson
went
to
washington
to
superintend
the
printing
of
her
history
of
the
mission
and
here
she
was
detained
contrary
to
her
wishes
until
the
last
of
april
however
this
detention
gave
her
an
opportunity
of
meeting
the
baptist
general
convention
which
held
its
session
there
at
that
time
a
committee
was
appointed
to
confer
with
her
respecting
the
burman
mission
and
at
her
suggestion
several
important
measures
were
adopted
when
the
printing
of
her
work
was
completed
she
presented
the
to
the
convention
the
work
was
favorably
noticed
in
several
leading
journals
of
the
day
and
has
circulated
extensively
both
in
europe
and
this
country
it
was
of
great
service
not
only
to
the
cause
of
the
particular
field
of
which
it
was
the
history
but
to
the
cause
of
missions
generally
in
awaking
the
public
mind
from
that
strange
apathy
in
regard
to
our
saviour
parting
command
in
which
for
seventeen
centuries
it
had
for
the
most
part
quietly
slumbered
we
say
the
most
for
we
do
not
forget
the
labors
of
the
roman
catholics
in
propagating
their
doctrines
in
various
parts
of
the
world
indeed
this
has
always
been
the
bright
redeeming
feature
of
that
system
of
christianity
well
would
it
be
if
protestant
christians
would
imitate
their
zeal
and
how
strange
that
centuries
passed
even
after
the
reformation
before
christians
began
to
recognize
as
binding
that
solemn
injunction
go
ye
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
with
its
encouraging
promise
lo
i
am
with
you
always
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
this
in
respect
to
the
cause
nearest
her
heart
was
a
great
source
of
grief
to
j
in
a
letter
to
wayland
written
in
washington
after
stating
that
she
had
found
that
her
strength
was
not
sufficiently
restored
to
undertake
a
journey
to
the
north
she
says
this
together
with
the
hope
of
exciting
more
attention
to
the
subject
of
missions
among
the
members
of
the
general
convention
which
will
soon
meet
here
has
induced
me
to
remain
oh
my
brother
my
heart
sickens
at
the
apathy
and
unconcern
relative
to
the
subject
of
missions
which
are
in
many
places
exhibited
i
sometimes
say
to
myself
will
not
the
missionary
flame
become
entirely
extinct
and
the
mission
already
established
in
burmah
die
for
want
of
support
where
are
our
young
men
fired
with
the
love
of
christ
and
compassion
for
immortal
souls
who
are
to
leave
their
comforts
and
their
homes
for
a
few
years
to
serve
their
redeemer
in
foreign
lands
who
is
willing
to
obey
this
last
this
most
benevolent
command
of
our
lord
go
ye
into
all
the
world
and
preach
the
gospel
to
every
creature
but
i
must
stop
loss
of
sleep
for
this
night
will
be
the
consequence
of
indulging
myself
thus
far
at
the
convention
jonathan
wade
of
new
york
and
george
boardman
of
maine
had
offered
themselves
as
missionaries
to
the
east
wade
was
soon
after
regularly
appointed
by
the
board
and
with
his
wife
was
directed
to
take
passage
for
india
with
judson
the
latter
writes
to
her
sister
from
boston
upon
her
arrival
there
from
the
south
we
arrived
in
safety
at
six
on
thursday
we
were
immediately
informed
that
and
wade
would
sail
with
me
to
india
this
was
animating
intelligence
and
i
felt
that
the
hand
of
god
was
in
it
for
he
had
heard
my
prayers
yesterday
we
went
on
board
the
ship
chose
my
cabin
and
agreed
with
the
captain
to
take
us
all
for
twelve
hundred
dollars
the
accommodations
are
excellent
clean
and
airy
it
is
a
most
beautiful
ship
and
the
captain
seems
disposed
to
do
all
in
his
power
for
our
comfort
i
am
now
making
preparations
for
my
passage
monday
we
have
a
and
on
tuesday
we
go
to
plymouth
i
am
doubting
whether
i
ought
to
go
to
bradford
again
or
not
my
nerves
are
in
such
a
state
that
i
have
to
make
every
possible
exertion
to
keep
them
quiet
it
will
only
increase
my
agitation
to
take
a
formal
leave
of
my
friends
and
home
on
the
of
june
they
sailed
from
boston
amidst
every
demonstration
of
personal
attachment
and
christian
sympathy
they
carried
with
them
a
valuable
present
and
a
letter
from
the
convention
to
the
burman
emperor
sent
in
the
hope
of
conciliating
his
favor
toward
the
missionaries
chapter
xv
judson
and
price
visit
their
reception
at
their
return
to
mrs
judson
a
letter
to
her
parents
describing
their
removal
to
description
of
ava
it
was
mentioned
that
during
judson
absence
from
burmah
price
the
fame
of
whose
medical
skill
had
reached
the
ears
had
been
ordered
to
ava
and
that
judson
had
determined
to
make
another
attempt
to
procure
toleration
for
the
christians
by
a
second
visit
to
the
capital
in
a
boat
furnished
by
government
they
left
rangoon
embarked
for
ava
then
the
capital
and
were
immediately
introduced
to
the
king
price
was
graciously
received
but
at
the
first
interview
judson
was
scarcely
noticed
of
the
second
interview
we
will
give
the
account
in
judson
own
words
the
king
noticed
me
for
the
first
time
after
some
time
he
said
you
in
black
what
are
you
a
medical
man
too
a
medical
man
but
a
teacher
of
religion
your
majesty
he
proceeded
to
make
a
few
inquiries
about
my
religion
and
then
put
the
alarming
inquiry
whether
any
had
embraced
it
i
evaded
by
saying
here
he
persisted
there
any
in
rangoon
are
a
few
they
foreigners
i
trembled
for
the
consequence
of
an
answer
which
might
involve
the
little
church
in
ruin
but
the
truth
must
be
sacrificed
or
the
consequences
hazarded
and
i
therefore
replied
are
some
foreigners
and
some
burmans
he
remained
silent
a
few
moments
but
presently
showed
he
was
not
displeased
by
asking
a
great
variety
of
questions
on
religion
and
geography
and
astronomy
some
of
which
were
answered
in
such
a
satisfactory
manner
as
to
occasion
a
general
expression
of
satisfaction
in
all
the
court
present
after
his
majesty
retired
a
royal
secretary
entered
into
conversation
and
allowed
me
to
expatiate
on
several
topics
of
religion
in
my
usual
way
and
all
this
took
place
in
the
presence
of
the
very
man
now
an
atwenwoon
one
of
the
highest
officers
who
many
years
ago
caused
his
uncle
to
be
tortured
under
the
iron
mall
for
renouncing
buddhism
and
embracing
the
romish
religion
thanks
to
god
for
the
encouragement
of
this
day
the
monarch
of
the
empire
has
distinctly
understood
that
some
of
his
subjects
have
embraced
the
christian
religion
and
his
wrath
has
been
restrained
he
afterwards
had
another
interview
in
which
the
king
inquired
much
about
america
and
authorized
him
to
invite
her
ships
to
his
dominions
assuring
them
of
protection
and
facilities
for
trade
he
mentions
much
flattering
attention
paid
him
by
a
prince
of
the
empire
and
his
wife
who
was
the
king
sister
both
of
whom
urged
him
not
to
return
to
rangoon
but
to
bring
his
wife
and
reside
at
ava
in
fact
several
dignitaries
of
the
empire
were
so
far
attracted
by
the
new
theories
in
religion
and
science
as
to
enter
into
animated
discussions
with
the
missionaries
respecting
them
the
prince
above
mentioned
was
an
interesting
character
judson
went
so
far
as
boldly
to
urge
upon
him
the
duty
of
making
personal
religion
his
immediate
care
for
a
moment
he
was
moved
but
soon
replied
that
he
was
young
only
that
he
was
desirous
of
enlarging
his
mind
by
an
acquaintance
with
all
foreign
science
and
then
he
could
judge
whether
christianity
was
worthy
of
his
adoption
or
not
but
said
judson
suppose
you
change
worlds
in
the
meantime
his
countenance
fell
and
he
said
sadly
it
is
true
i
do
not
know
when
i
shall
die
how
true
it
is
that
as
in
water
face
answereth
to
face
so
doth
the
heart
of
man
to
man
left
without
excuse
this
poor
impenitent
burman
like
thousands
in
america
almost
but
not
altogether
persuaded
to
be
christians
postponed
what
he
could
not
but
purpose
to
a
more
convenient
season
on
another
occasion
so
many
persons
of
high
rank
expressed
themselves
favorably
to
the
christian
faith
that
one
who
had
not
hitherto
ventured
to
defend
the
missionaries
in
the
presence
of
the
king
was
bold
enough
to
say
nearly
all
the
world
your
majesty
believe
in
an
eternal
god
all
but
burmah
and
siam
these
little
spots
his
majesty
remained
silent
and
soon
abruptly
rose
and
retired
before
returning
to
rangoon
judson
had
an
interesting
interview
with
the
king
why
asked
the
latter
does
the
teacher
return
to
rangoon
let
him
and
price
stay
together
if
one
goes
the
other
must
remain
alone
and
will
be
unhappy
some
one
present
explained
that
he
was
going
for
his
wife
and
goods
and
would
soon
return
his
majesty
said
will
you
then
come
again
and
expressed
a
wish
that
he
should
do
so
and
remain
permanently
he
and
price
had
previously
erected
a
house
near
ava
on
some
land
granted
them
by
the
king
which
house
was
to
be
occupied
by
until
judson
return
the
following
letter
from
judson
dated
announces
the
arrival
of
his
wife
in
rangoon
i
had
the
inexpressible
happiness
of
welcoming
judson
once
more
to
the
shores
of
burmah
on
the
instant
we
are
now
on
the
eve
of
departure
for
ava
my
last
letter
from
brother
price
mentions
that
the
king
has
inquired
many
times
about
my
delay
and
the
queen
has
expressed
a
strong
desire
to
see
judson
in
her
foreign
dress
we
sincerely
hope
her
curiosity
will
not
be
confined
to
dress
and
wade
appear
to
be
in
fine
health
and
spirits
and
i
am
heartily
rejoiced
at
their
arrival
just
at
the
present
time
rumors
of
a
war
between
the
british
and
burmans
were
growing
more
and
more
prevalent
and
alas
proved
but
too
well
founded
from
the
very
last
letter
written
by
judson
before
this
most
unhappy
and
disastrous
war
we
shall
now
make
some
extracts
ava
february
my
dear
parents
and
sisters
after
nearly
two
years
and
a
half
wandering
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
i
have
at
last
arrived
at
home
so
far
as
this
life
is
concerned
and
am
once
more
quietly
and
happily
settled
with
judson
when
i
retrace
the
scenes
through
which
i
have
passed
the
immense
space
i
have
traversed
and
the
various
dangers
seen
and
unseen
from
which
i
have
been
preserved
my
heart
is
filled
with
gratitude
and
praise
to
that
being
who
has
at
all
times
been
my
protector
and
marked
out
all
my
way
before
me
we
had
a
quick
and
pleasant
passage
from
calcutta
to
rangoon
and
in
seven
days
after
our
arrival
there
we
were
on
our
way
to
this
place
our
progress
up
the
river
was
slow
indeed
the
season
however
is
cool
and
delightful
we
were
preserved
from
dangers
by
day
and
robbers
by
night
and
arrived
in
safety
in
six
weeks
the
irrawaddy
is
a
noble
river
we
often
walked
through
the
villages
on
its
banks
and
though
we
never
received
the
least
insult
we
always
attracted
universal
attention
a
foreign
female
was
a
sight
never
before
beheld
and
all
were
anxious
that
their
friends
and
relations
should
have
a
view
crowds
followed
us
through
the
villages
and
some
less
civilized
than
the
others
would
run
some
way
before
us
in
order
to
have
a
look
as
we
approached
them
after
relating
a
conversation
with
the
natives
on
the
subject
of
religion
and
a
narrow
escape
from
drowning
she
comes
to
their
arrival
at
ava
where
they
had
difficulties
such
as
she
had
never
before
experienced
price
urged
their
going
immediately
to
the
house
he
had
just
erected
but
it
was
of
brick
and
the
walls
still
so
damp
that
they
did
not
dare
occupy
it
she
says
we
had
but
one
alternative
and
that
was
to
remain
in
the
boat
till
they
could
build
a
small
house
on
the
piece
of
ground
which
the
king
gave
to
last
year
and
you
will
hardly
believe
it
possible
for
i
almost
doubt
my
senses
that
in
just
a
fortnight
from
our
arrival
we
moved
into
a
house
built
in
that
time
which
is
large
enough
to
make
us
comfortable
it
is
in
a
most
delightful
situation
out
of
the
dust
of
the
town
and
on
the
bank
of
the
river
our
house
is
in
a
healthy
situation
is
raised
four
feet
from
the
ground
and
consists
of
three
small
rooms
and
a
verandah
we
hardly
know
how
we
shall
bear
the
hot
season
which
is
just
commencing
for
our
house
is
built
of
boards
and
before
night
is
heated
like
an
oven
nothing
but
brick
is
a
shelter
from
the
heat
at
ava
where
the
thermometer
even
in
the
shade
frequently
rises
to
degrees
we
have
worship
every
evening
in
burman
when
a
number
of
the
natives
assemble
and
every
sabbath
judson
preaches
the
other
side
of
the
river
in
price
house
we
feel
it
an
inestimable
privilege
that
amid
all
our
discouragements
we
have
the
language
and
are
able
constantly
to
communicate
truths
which
can
save
the
soul
she
then
mentions
that
she
has
commenced
a
female
school
with
three
little
girls
two
of
them
given
her
by
their
parents
fine
children
who
improve
very
rapidly
and
that
she
has
a
prospect
of
more
pupils
they
did
not
immediately
visit
the
palace
as
the
royal
family
were
absent
on
a
visit
at
amarapoora
their
old
capital
where
they
were
to
remain
until
the
new
palace
in
ava
should
be
finished
she
found
her
old
friend
the
viceroy
wife
now
degraded
by
the
death
of
her
husband
to
a
low
rank
but
a
sensible
woman
and
more
capable
thought
of
receiving
religious
truth
than
when
in
public
life
she
adds
that
in
consequence
of
war
with
the
bengal
government
foreigners
are
not
in
as
much
esteem
at
court
as
formerly
even
americans
shared
the
same
disfavor
as
englishmen
for
being
similar
in
features
dress
language
and
religion
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
burmans
should
have
confounded
them
as
subjects
of
one
government
from
the
circumstance
of
money
being
remitted
to
them
through
english
residents
in
ava
they
were
even
suspected
of
being
paid
spies
of
the
east
india
company
but
this
was
at
a
somewhat
later
period
the
capital
of
burmah
is
not
fixed
but
changes
with
the
caprice
of
the
monarch
for
wherever
he
fixes
his
imperial
residence
there
for
the
time
is
the
capital
ava
the
former
capital
having
been
forsaken
during
the
reign
of
the
old
king
for
amarapoora
was
again
to
be
the
royal
residence
and
for
this
purpose
a
magnificent
palace
had
been
there
erected
of
which
the
emperor
was
now
to
take
possession
on
these
occasions
all
the
gorgeousness
of
oriental
magnificence
has
its
full
display
such
a
scene
the
missionaires
witnessed
soon
after
their
arrival
at
ava
judson
gives
an
animated
description
of
that
splendid
day
when
majesty
with
all
its
attendant
glory
entered
the
gates
of
the
golden
city
and
amid
the
acclamations
of
millions
took
possession
of
the
palace
the
numerous
horses
the
immense
variety
of
vehicles
the
vast
number
and
size
of
richly
caparisoned
elephants
the
myriads
of
people
in
their
gala
dresses
the
highest
officers
in
the
kingdom
drawn
from
the
most
distant
as
well
as
the
nearer
provinces
to
grace
the
occasion
each
in
his
robes
of
state
the
magnificent
white
elephant
caparisoned
with
silk
and
velvet
and
blazing
with
jewels
the
king
and
queen
in
simple
majesty
alone
unadorned
amid
the
gaudy
throng
surpassed
any
pageant
ever
exhibited
in
the
western
world
alas
this
pomp
and
pride
were
soon
to
receive
a
disastrous
humiliation
chapter
xvi
war
with
the
narrative
of
the
sufferings
of
the
missionaries
during
the
war
in
news
reached
america
of
the
breaking
out
of
war
between
burmah
and
british
india
this
of
course
excited
the
most
anxious
interest
for
the
fate
of
the
americans
in
that
country
at
length
anxiety
was
somewhat
relieved
by
the
intelligence
that
wade
and
hough
with
their
families
who
had
remained
at
rangoon
were
after
dreadful
sufferings
safe
under
british
protection
but
over
the
fate
of
and
judson
hung
the
silence
of
death
or
of
a
suspense
worse
than
death
for
more
than
two
years
until
hope
itself
died
in
the
hearts
of
their
friends
and
kindred
but
although
in
this
long
period
of
doubt
and
darkness
busy
fancy
had
pictured
many
scenes
of
terror
and
many
forms
of
violent
death
as
the
possible
lot
of
the
missionaries
yet
in
her
wildest
nights
she
never
could
have
conceived
of
the
terrible
reality
which
they
endured
not
for
days
and
weeks
only
but
for
weary
months
the
wildest
tale
of
fiction
has
never
depicted
more
cruel
anguish
more
appalling
suffering
borne
with
more
heroic
energy
and
more
sublime
fortitude
the
wildest
fiction
would
not
dare
to
portray
woman
love
and
faith
and
christian
hope
so
long
triumphant
over
insult
and
outrage
and
torture
and
death
itself
who
after
reading
the
following
narrative
of
an
heroic
female
unparalleled
endurance
will
ever
say
that
woman
is
a
feeble
nature
incapable
of
withstanding
the
rude
shocks
of
adverse
fortune
nay
who
will
not
rather
say
that
in
woman
hope
and
faith
and
fortitude
and
energy
make
even
the
frail
immortal
till
her
labor
of
love
is
accomplished
and
its
cherished
object
is
rescued
from
peril
the
war
which
now
broke
out
between
the
burman
government
and
that
of
the
english
in
bengal
forms
an
important
era
in
the
history
of
the
mission
its
first
effect
was
to
put
an
end
to
the
labors
of
the
missionaries
and
involve
them
in
unspeakable
sufferings
yet
in
accordance
with
a
mysterious
though
beneficent
law
of
human
affairs
its
ultimate
issues
have
proved
favorable
not
only
to
the
interests
of
that
particular
mission
but
also
to
the
further
extension
of
christian
civilization
among
the
thickly
peopled
countries
of
eastern
india
the
war
had
its
origin
in
feuds
which
had
long
existed
on
the
frontiers
of
chittagong
some
burman
criminals
had
escaped
to
that
territory
where
as
it
was
alleged
they
were
protected
by
british
power
the
burman
monarch
determined
to
chastise
the
english
by
making
war
on
their
government
and
had
raised
thirty
thousand
troops
under
the
command
of
his
greatest
warrior
bandula
but
the
east
india
company
anticipated
his
movements
and
landed
their
forces
at
rangoon
so
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
that
the
city
fell
into
their
hands
with
scarcely
a
show
of
resistance
this
was
the
first
news
that
reached
ava
of
the
commencement
of
hostilities
it
surprised
the
court
there
but
by
no
means
alarmed
them
never
having
come
into
collision
with
the
english
and
having
the
most
extravagant
conceit
of
their
own
invincibility
they
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
their
power
to
drive
the
invaders
from
their
country
and
even
sent
by
one
of
their
generals
a
pair
of
golden
fetters
with
which
to
chain
the
and
bring
him
captive
to
ava
the
first
effect
of
the
intelligence
of
the
war
upon
the
situation
of
the
missionaries
was
an
order
that
no
man
wearing
a
hat
should
enter
the
palace
this
was
somewhat
startling
still
nothing
of
importance
occurred
for
several
weeks
during
which
continued
her
school
while
her
husband
went
on
building
a
house
but
at
length
suspicion
having
been
excited
that
the
englishmen
who
resided
in
ava
were
spies
they
were
seized
and
put
in
confinement
price
and
judson
were
strictly
examined
also
but
nothing
being
proved
against
them
they
were
left
at
liberty
they
might
probably
have
escaped
further
molestation
had
it
not
been
found
in
examining
the
accounts
of
one
of
the
englishmen
that
he
had
paid
over
considerable
money
to
the
missionaries
ignorant
of
money
transactions
as
carried
on
by
foreigners
this
was
an
evidence
to
the
natives
that
the
teachers
were
in
the
pay
of
the
british
and
probably
spies
this
being
represented
to
the
king
he
gave
an
angry
order
for
their
arrest
on
the
of
june
judson
house
was
rudely
entered
by
an
officer
followed
by
eight
or
ten
men
one
of
whom
by
the
hideous
tattooing
on
his
face
they
knew
to
be
the
executioner
or
of
the
prison
on
seeing
judson
you
are
called
by
the
king
said
the
officer
the
usual
form
of
arrest
in
an
instant
the
man
threw
him
on
the
floor
and
drew
forth
that
instrument
of
torture
the
small
cord
judson
tried
in
vain
to
bribe
him
with
money
take
her
too
said
the
officer
she
also
is
a
foreigner
but
this
order
judson
prevailed
on
them
to
disregard
all
was
now
confusion
and
dismay
the
children
crying
the
neighbors
collecting
around
and
in
the
house
while
the
executioner
bound
judson
with
the
cords
and
took
a
fiendish
pleasure
in
making
them
as
tight
as
possible
judson
gave
moung
ing
money
that
he
might
follow
and
procure
a
mitigation
of
this
torture
instead
of
which
judson
was
again
thrown
down
and
the
cords
so
tightened
as
almost
to
prevent
respiration
then
he
was
hurried
on
to
the
thence
to
the
death
prison
into
which
he
was
hurled
and
moung
ing
saw
him
no
more
we
may
imagine
the
intolerable
agony
of
judson
when
the
faithful
disciple
returned
with
the
sad
news
of
his
master
fate
retiring
to
her
room
she
tried
to
find
consolation
in
casting
her
dreadful
burden
of
fear
and
suspense
on
her
covenant
god
but
soon
her
retirement
was
invaded
by
the
magistrate
of
the
place
who
ordered
her
to
come
out
and
submit
to
an
examination
of
course
she
was
obliged
to
obey
but
before
doing
so
she
destroyed
every
writing
she
possessed
letters
journals
everything
lest
her
correspondence
with
her
british
friends
should
confirm
the
suspicions
of
their
persecutors
when
the
magistrate
had
satisfied
himself
with
the
examination
he
placed
a
guard
of
ten
ruffians
about
the
house
with
orders
that
no
one
should
enter
or
leave
it
on
pain
of
death
taking
her
four
little
burman
girls
into
an
inner
room
she
barred
the
door
and
obstinately
refused
to
come
out
although
the
guard
bent
on
tormenting
her
threatened
to
break
the
door
down
if
she
did
not
she
prevented
this
outrage
by
a
threat
to
complain
of
their
conduct
in
the
morning
to
higher
authorities
but
in
revenge
they
bound
her
two
bengalee
servants
fast
in
the
stocks
in
a
most
painful
posture
by
bribes
and
promises
she
at
length
induced
them
to
release
the
servants
but
their
dreadful
carousings
and
horrid
language
combined
with
her
suspense
in
regard
to
her
husband
fate
rendered
that
long
night
one
of
unmitigated
wretchedness
in
the
morning
moung
ing
whom
she
had
sent
to
the
prison
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
all
the
white
foreigners
were
in
the
chained
with
three
pairs
of
fetters
each
to
a
pole
to
prevent
their
moving
the
point
of
anguish
now
was
she
says
that
i
was
a
prisoner
myself
and
could
make
no
efforts
for
their
relief
she
earnestly
but
vainly
begged
the
magistrate
to
allow
her
to
go
and
state
the
case
to
some
government
officer
she
even
wrote
a
letter
to
the
queen
sister
who
was
civil
but
afraid
to
interfere
in
their
behalf
the
day
she
says
wore
heavily
away
and
another
dreadful
night
was
before
me
i
endeavored
to
soften
the
feelings
of
the
guard
by
giving
them
tea
and
segars
for
the
night
so
that
they
allowed
me
to
remain
inside
my
room
without
threatening
as
they
did
the
night
before
but
haunted
by
the
idea
of
her
dear
husband
tortures
which
she
was
neither
permitted
to
share
nor
alleviate
she
of
course
passed
another
night
of
anguish
the
next
day
she
sent
a
message
to
the
governor
of
the
city
to
allow
her
to
visit
him
with
a
present
this
was
successful
and
the
guards
had
orders
to
permit
her
to
go
into
town
she
was
pleasantly
received
stated
the
situation
of
the
teachers
and
assured
the
governor
that
being
not
englishmen
but
americans
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
war
she
was
referred
to
a
head
officer
with
whom
she
might
consult
as
to
the
means
of
making
the
prisoners
more
comfortable
their
release
was
out
of
the
the
first
sight
of
this
officer
whose
face
exhibited
the
working
of
every
evil
passion
inspired
her
with
dread
but
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
assist
her
he
took
me
aside
and
endeavored
to
convince
me
that
myself
as
well
as
the
prisoners
was
entirely
at
his
disposal
that
our
future
comfort
must
depend
on
my
liberality
in
regard
to
presents
and
that
these
must
be
made
in
a
private
way
and
unknown
to
any
officer
of
government
what
must
i
do
said
i
to
obtain
a
mitigation
of
the
sufferings
of
the
two
teachers
to
me
said
he
hundred
tickals
about
a
hundred
dollars
two
pieces
of
fine
cloth
and
two
pieces
of
handkerchiefs
at
length
however
he
consented
to
take
what
money
she
had
about
her
which
was
a
considerable
sum
and
promised
to
relieve
the
teachers
from
their
most
painful
situation
she
goes
on
i
then
procured
an
order
from
the
governor
for
my
admittance
into
the
prison
but
the
sensation
produced
by
meeting
my
husband
in
that
situation
and
the
scene
that
ensued
i
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
he
crawled
to
the
door
of
the
prison
for
i
was
never
allowed
to
enter
gave
me
some
directions
relative
to
his
release
but
before
we
could
make
any
arrangement
i
was
ordered
to
depart
by
those
jailers
who
could
not
endure
to
see
us
enjoy
the
poor
consolation
of
meeting
in
that
miserable
place
in
vain
i
pleaded
the
order
of
the
governor
for
my
admittance
they
again
harshly
repeated
or
we
will
pull
you
out
the
same
evening
all
the
foreigners
succeeded
by
the
payment
of
money
in
being
removed
from
the
common
prison
to
an
open
shed
where
judson
was
allowed
to
send
them
food
and
mats
to
sleep
on
but
for
some
days
was
not
permitted
to
see
them
nothing
but
her
own
eloquent
words
can
do
justice
to
the
transactions
that
followed
we
copy
as
before
from
her
letter
written
two
years
subsequent
to
these
events
to
her
judson
my
next
object
was
to
get
a
petition
presented
to
the
queen
but
no
person
being
admitted
into
the
palace
who
was
in
disgrace
with
his
majesty
i
sought
to
present
it
through
the
medium
of
her
wife
i
had
visited
her
in
better
days
and
received
particular
marks
of
her
favor
but
now
times
were
altered
judson
was
in
prison
and
i
in
distress
which
was
a
sufficient
reason
for
giving
me
a
cold
reception
i
took
a
present
of
considerable
value
she
was
lolling
on
her
carpet
as
i
entered
with
her
attendants
around
her
i
waited
not
for
the
usual
question
to
a
suppliant
do
you
want
but
in
a
bold
earnest
yet
respectful
manner
stated
our
distresses
and
our
wrongs
and
begged
her
assistance
she
partly
raised
her
head
opened
the
present
i
had
brought
and
coolly
replied
case
is
not
singular
all
the
foreigners
are
treated
alike
but
it
singular
said
i
the
teachers
are
americans
they
are
ministers
of
religion
have
nothing
to
do
with
war
or
politics
and
came
to
ava
in
obedience
to
the
king
command
they
have
never
done
anything
to
deserve
such
treatment
and
is
it
right
they
should
be
treated
thus
king
does
as
he
pleases
said
she
am
not
the
king
what
can
i
do
you
can
state
their
case
to
the
queen
and
obtain
their
release
replied
i
place
yourself
in
my
situation
were
you
in
america
your
husband
innocent
of
crime
thrown
into
prison
in
irons
and
you
a
solitary
unprotected
female
what
would
you
do
with
a
slight
degree
of
feeling
she
said
will
present
your
petition
come
again
i
returned
to
the
house
with
considerable
hope
that
the
speedy
release
of
the
missionaries
was
at
hand
but
the
next
day
the
property
of
gouger
one
of
the
englishmen
amounting
to
dollars
was
seized
and
carried
to
the
palace
the
officers
on
their
return
politely
informed
me
that
they
should
our
on
the
morrow
i
felt
obliged
for
this
information
and
accordingly
made
preparations
to
receive
them
by
secreting
as
many
little
articles
as
possible
together
with
considerable
silver
as
i
knew
if
the
war
should
be
protracted
we
should
be
in
a
state
of
starvation
without
it
but
my
mind
was
in
a
dreadful
state
of
agitation
lest
it
should
be
discovered
and
cause
my
being
thrown
into
prison
and
had
it
been
possible
to
procure
money
from
any
other
quarter
i
should
not
have
ventured
on
such
a
step
the
following
morning
the
royal
treasurer
the
governor
of
the
north
gate
of
the
palace
who
was
in
future
our
steady
friend
and
another
nobleman
attended
by
forty
or
fifty
followers
came
to
take
possession
of
all
we
had
i
treated
them
civilly
gave
them
seats
and
tea
and
sweetmeats
for
their
refreshment
and
justice
obliges
me
to
say
that
they
conducted
the
business
of
confiscation
with
more
regard
to
my
feelings
than
i
should
have
thought
it
possible
for
burmese
officers
to
exhibit
the
three
officers
with
one
of
the
royal
secretaries
alone
entered
the
house
their
attendants
were
ordered
to
remain
outside
they
saw
i
was
deeply
affected
and
apologized
for
what
they
were
about
to
do
by
saying
that
it
was
painful
for
them
to
take
possession
of
property
not
their
own
but
they
were
compelled
thus
to
do
by
order
of
the
king
where
is
your
silver
gold
and
jewels
said
the
royal
treasurer
i
have
no
gold
or
jewels
but
here
is
the
key
of
a
trunk
which
contains
the
silver
do
with
it
as
you
please
the
trunk
was
produced
and
the
silver
weighed
this
money
said
i
was
collected
in
america
by
the
disciples
of
christ
and
sent
here
for
the
purpose
of
building
a
kyoung
the
name
of
a
priest
dwelling
and
for
our
support
while
teaching
the
religion
of
christ
is
it
suitable
that
you
should
take
it
the
burmans
are
averse
to
taking
religious
offerings
which
was
the
cause
of
my
making
the
inquiry
we
will
state
this
circumstance
to
the
king
said
one
of
them
and
perhaps
he
will
restore
it
but
is
this
all
the
silver
you
have
i
could
not
tell
a
falsehood
the
house
is
in
your
possession
i
replied
search
for
yourselves
have
you
not
deposited
silver
with
some
person
of
your
acquaintance
my
acquaintances
are
all
in
prison
with
whom
should
i
deposit
silver
they
next
ordered
my
trunk
and
drawers
to
be
examined
the
secretary
only
was
allowed
to
accompany
me
in
this
search
everything
nice
or
curious
which
met
his
view
was
presented
to
the
officers
for
their
decision
whether
it
should
be
taken
or
retained
i
begged
they
would
not
take
our
wearing
apparel
as
it
would
be
disgraceful
to
take
clothes
partly
worn
into
the
possession
of
his
majesty
and
to
us
they
were
of
unspeakable
value
they
assented
and
took
a
list
only
and
did
the
same
with
the
books
medicines
my
little
and
presents
from
my
beloved
brother
i
rescued
from
their
grasp
partly
by
artifice
and
partly
through
their
ignorance
they
left
also
many
articles
which
were
of
inestimable
value
during
our
long
imprisonment
chapter
xvii
narrative
continued
and
their
deliverance
from
burman
tyranny
and
protection
by
the
british
government
as
soon
as
the
search
was
completed
judson
hastened
to
the
wife
of
the
queen
brother
in
hopes
of
having
a
favorable
answer
to
her
petition
but
to
her
heavy
disappointment
she
learned
that
the
queen
had
refused
to
interfere
with
a
sad
heart
she
turned
her
steps
to
the
but
here
she
was
denied
admittance
and
for
ten
days
she
found
the
closed
against
her
the
officers
who
had
taken
possession
of
our
property
continues
judson
presented
it
to
his
majesty
saying
is
a
true
teacher
we
found
nothing
in
his
house
but
what
belongs
to
priests
in
addition
to
this
money
there
are
an
immense
number
of
books
medicines
trunks
of
wearing
apparel
of
which
we
have
only
taken
a
list
shall
we
take
them
or
let
them
remain
them
remain
said
the
king
put
this
property
by
itself
for
it
shall
be
restored
to
him
again
if
he
be
found
innocent
this
was
in
allusion
to
the
idea
of
his
being
a
spy
while
the
officers
were
at
mr
j
house
they
had
insisted
on
knowing
the
sum
that
had
been
paid
to
bribe
the
governor
to
allow
the
prisoners
more
liberty
this
sum
they
afterwards
demanded
of
the
governor
which
so
enraged
him
that
he
threatened
to
thrust
them
back
into
the
inner
prison
when
waited
on
him
the
next
morning
his
first
words
were
you
are
very
bad
why
did
you
tell
the
royal
treasurer
you
had
given
me
so
much
money
the
treasurer
inquired
what
could
i
say
she
replied
say
that
you
had
given
me
nothing
said
he
and
i
would
have
made
the
teachers
comfortable
in
prison
but
now
i
know
not
what
will
be
their
fate
but
i
can
not
tell
a
falsehood
she
replied
my
religion
differs
from
yours
it
forbids
prevarication
and
had
you
stood
by
me
with
your
knife
raised
i
could
not
have
said
what
you
suggest
this
answer
so
pleased
the
wife
of
the
governor
who
sat
by
that
she
ever
afterwards
was
a
firm
friend
to
judson
the
latter
then
by
the
present
of
a
beautiful
a
gift
from
her
english
friends
and
by
promises
of
future
presents
induced
the
governor
to
let
her
husband
remain
where
he
was
but
poor
price
was
confined
as
at
first
and
was
only
relieved
at
the
end
of
ten
days
by
his
promising
a
piece
of
broadcloth
and
presents
from
judson
sometimes
she
was
summoned
before
the
authorities
to
answer
the
most
absurd
charges
and
daily
she
was
subjected
to
the
most
harassing
annoyance
from
the
desire
of
each
petty
officer
to
get
money
through
their
misfortunes
notwithstanding
her
repulse
in
her
application
to
the
queen
hardly
a
day
passed
for
seven
months
that
she
did
not
visit
some
one
of
the
members
of
government
or
branches
of
the
royal
family
in
order
to
gain
their
influence
in
behalf
of
the
teachers
though
the
only
benefit
was
that
their
encouraging
promises
preserved
her
from
despair
she
did
however
in
this
manner
gain
friends
who
sometimes
assisted
her
with
food
and
who
tried
to
destroy
the
impression
that
they
were
concerned
in
the
war
the
extortions
and
oppressions
to
which
the
prisoners
were
subject
were
also
indescribable
sometimes
judson
was
forbidden
to
have
any
intercourse
with
them
during
the
day
and
therefore
she
would
have
two
miles
to
walk
after
dark
in
returning
to
her
house
she
says
oh
how
many
many
times
have
i
returned
from
that
dreary
prison
at
nine
at
night
solitary
and
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
anxiety
and
thrown
myself
down
in
that
same
you
and
deacon
provided
for
me
in
boston
and
endeavored
to
invent
some
new
scheme
for
the
release
of
the
prisoners
sometimes
for
a
moment
or
two
my
thoughts
would
glance
toward
america
and
my
beloved
friends
there
out
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
so
entirely
engrossed
was
every
thought
with
present
scenes
and
sufferings
that
i
seldom
reflected
on
a
single
occurrence
of
my
former
life
or
recollected
that
i
had
a
friend
in
existence
out
of
you
my
dear
brother
who
know
my
strong
attachment
to
my
friends
and
how
much
pleasure
i
have
hitherto
experienced
from
retrospect
can
judge
from
the
above
circumstance
how
intense
were
my
sufferings
but
the
point
the
acme
of
my
distress
consisted
in
the
awful
uncertainty
of
our
final
fate
my
prevailing
opinion
was
that
my
husband
would
suffer
violent
death
and
that
i
should
of
course
become
a
slave
and
languish
out
a
miserable
though
short
existence
in
the
tyrannic
hands
of
some
unfeeling
monster
but
the
consolations
of
religion
in
these
trying
circumstances
were
neither
few
nor
small
it
taught
me
to
look
beyond
this
world
to
that
rest
that
peaceful
happy
rest
where
jesus
reigns
and
oppression
never
enters
in
the
meantime
the
burmese
government
was
sending
army
after
army
down
the
river
to
fight
the
english
and
constantly
receiving
news
of
their
defeat
and
destruction
one
of
its
officers
however
named
bandoola
having
been
more
successful
the
king
sent
for
him
to
ava
and
conferred
on
him
the
command
of
a
very
large
army
destined
against
rangoon
as
he
was
receiving
every
demonstration
of
court
favor
judson
resolved
to
wait
on
him
with
a
petition
for
the
release
of
the
prisoners
she
was
received
in
an
obliging
manner
and
directed
to
call
again
when
he
should
have
deliberated
on
the
subject
with
the
joyful
news
of
her
flattering
reception
she
flew
to
the
prison
and
both
she
and
her
husband
thought
deliverance
was
at
hand
but
on
going
again
with
a
handsome
present
to
hear
his
decision
she
was
informed
by
his
lady
her
lord
being
absent
that
he
was
now
very
busy
making
preparations
for
rangoon
but
that
when
he
had
retaken
that
city
expelled
the
he
would
return
and
release
all
the
prisoners
this
was
her
last
application
for
their
enlargement
though
she
constantly
visited
the
various
officials
with
presents
in
order
to
make
the
situation
of
the
prisoners
more
tolerable
the
governor
of
the
palace
used
to
be
so
much
gratified
with
her
accounts
of
the
manners
customs
and
government
of
america
that
he
required
her
to
spend
many
hours
of
every
other
day
at
his
house
judson
had
been
permitted
to
make
for
her
husband
a
little
bamboo
room
in
the
prison
enclosure
far
more
comfortable
than
the
shed
he
had
occupied
and
where
she
sometimes
was
allowed
to
spend
a
few
hours
in
his
society
but
her
visits
both
to
the
prison
and
to
the
governor
were
interrupted
by
the
birth
of
a
little
daughter
truly
child
of
misery
baptized
in
tears
about
this
time
the
burmese
court
was
thrown
into
consternation
by
news
of
the
disastrous
defeat
of
bandoola
the
chief
who
was
to
expel
the
english
from
the
kingdom
and
the
rapid
advance
of
the
british
troops
towards
ava
the
first
consequence
of
such
intelligence
would
of
course
be
increased
rigor
towards
the
white
prisoners
and
accordingly
before
she
had
regained
her
strength
after
her
confinement
judson
learned
that
her
husband
had
been
put
into
the
inner
prison
in
five
pairs
of
fetters
that
the
room
she
had
made
for
him
had
been
torn
down
and
all
his
little
comforts
taken
away
by
his
jailers
all
the
prisoners
had
been
similarly
treated
judson
feeble
as
she
was
hastened
to
the
governor
house
but
in
her
long
absence
she
had
lost
favor
and
she
was
told
that
she
must
not
ask
to
have
the
fetters
taken
off
or
the
prisoners
released
for
could
not
be
she
made
a
pathetic
appeal
to
the
governor
who
was
an
old
man
reminding
him
of
all
his
former
kindness
to
them
and
begging
to
know
why
his
conduct
was
so
changed
to
them
now
his
hard
heart
melted
and
he
even
wept
like
a
child
he
then
confessed
to
her
that
he
had
often
been
ordered
to
assassinate
the
prisoners
privately
but
that
he
would
not
do
it
and
that
come
what
would
he
would
never
put
judson
to
death
at
the
same
time
he
was
resolute
in
refusing
to
attempt
any
mitigation
of
his
sufferings
the
situation
of
the
prisoners
was
now
horrible
in
the
extreme
there
were
more
than
one
hundred
of
them
shut
up
in
one
room
with
no
air
but
what
came
through
cracks
in
the
boards
and
this
in
the
hot
season
judson
was
sometimes
permitted
to
spend
five
minutes
at
the
door
but
the
sight
was
almost
too
horrible
to
be
borne
by
incessant
intreaties
she
obtained
permission
for
them
to
eat
their
food
outside
but
even
this
was
soon
forbidden
after
a
month
passed
in
this
way
judson
was
seized
with
fever
and
nothing
but
death
was
before
him
unless
he
could
have
more
air
judson
at
length
succeeded
in
putting
up
another
bamboo
hut
in
the
prison
enclosure
and
by
wearing
out
the
governor
with
her
entreaties
she
got
her
husband
removed
into
it
and
though
too
low
for
them
to
stand
upright
it
seemed
to
them
a
palace
in
comparison
with
the
prison
disastrous
news
of
the
war
continued
to
arrive
and
at
length
the
death
of
bandoola
seemed
to
be
the
climax
of
misfortune
who
could
be
found
to
take
his
place
a
government
officer
who
had
for
some
time
been
in
disgrace
with
the
king
now
came
forward
with
a
proposal
to
conquer
the
english
and
put
an
end
to
the
war
provided
an
army
was
raised
on
a
new
plan
his
offers
were
accepted
and
he
was
clothed
with
full
powers
he
was
a
man
of
talent
and
enterprise
and
a
violent
enemy
to
foreigners
the
missionaries
feared
everything
from
his
malignancy
and
their
fears
were
but
too
well
founded
they
had
been
in
their
comfortable
hut
but
a
few
days
when
was
suddenly
summoned
before
the
governor
and
detained
by
trifling
pretexts
for
some
time
in
order
as
she
afterwards
found
to
spare
her
the
dreadful
scene
that
was
enacted
at
the
prison
in
her
absence
on
leaving
him
she
met
a
servant
running
to
tell
her
that
all
the
white
prisoners
were
carried
away
he
knew
not
whither
she
ran
from
street
to
street
inquiring
for
them
until
at
length
she
was
informed
they
were
carried
to
amarapoora
she
hastened
to
the
governor
who
professed
his
ignorance
but
promised
to
send
off
a
man
to
inquire
their
fate
and
said
significantly
you
can
do
nothing
more
for
your
husband
care
of
she
returned
to
her
room
and
sank
down
almost
in
despair
this
was
the
most
insupportable
day
she
had
passed
she
resolved
to
go
to
amarapoora
packed
up
some
valuables
in
trunks
to
leave
with
the
governor
and
took
leave
of
ava
as
she
supposed
forever
she
obtained
a
pass
for
herself
and
infant
her
two
burman
girls
and
cook
and
got
on
board
a
boat
which
conveyed
them
within
two
miles
of
amarapoora
there
she
procured
a
cart
but
the
heat
and
dust
with
the
fatigue
of
carrying
her
infant
almost
deprived
her
of
reason
but
on
reaching
the
her
distress
was
further
aggravated
by
finding
that
she
must
go
four
miles
farther
to
a
place
called
there
in
an
old
shattered
building
without
a
roof
under
the
burning
sun
sat
the
poor
prisoners
chained
two
and
two
and
almost
in
a
dying
condition
she
prevailed
on
the
jailer
to
give
her
a
shelter
in
a
wretched
little
room
half
filled
with
grain
and
in
that
filthy
place
without
bed
chair
table
or
any
other
comfort
she
spent
the
next
of
wretchedness
the
account
given
her
by
judson
of
his
sufferings
since
she
had
seen
him
was
almost
too
dreadful
to
repeat
dragged
from
the
prison
and
stripped
of
their
clothing
they
were
driven
under
a
broiling
sun
over
the
hot
sand
and
gravel
until
their
naked
feet
were
all
one
wound
and
they
earnestly
longed
for
death
to
put
an
end
to
their
tortures
when
night
came
on
finding
that
one
of
the
prisoners
had
dropped
dead
and
that
the
others
were
utterly
unable
to
walk
their
driver
had
halted
till
the
next
morning
and
then
conveyed
them
the
remainder
of
the
distance
in
carts
on
arriving
and
seeing
the
dilapidated
condition
of
the
prison
they
confidently
thought
they
had
been
brought
here
for
execution
and
tried
to
prepare
themselves
to
meet
a
dreadful
and
perhaps
lingering
death
from
this
apprehension
they
were
relieved
by
seeing
preparations
made
to
repair
the
prison
judson
had
brought
from
ava
all
the
money
she
could
command
secreted
about
her
person
and
she
records
her
thankfulness
to
her
heavenly
father
that
she
never
suffered
from
want
of
money
though
frequently
from
want
of
provisions
hitherto
her
health
and
that
of
her
children
had
been
good
but
now
commenced
her
personal
bodily
sufferings
one
of
the
little
burman
girls
whom
she
had
adopted
and
whom
she
had
named
mary
hasseltine
was
attacked
on
the
morning
after
her
arrival
with
she
had
been
judson
only
assistant
in
the
care
of
her
infant
but
now
she
required
all
the
time
that
could
be
spared
from
judson
whose
mangled
feet
rendered
him
utterly
unable
to
move
judson
whole
time
was
spent
in
going
back
and
forth
from
the
prison
to
the
house
with
her
little
maria
in
her
arms
knowing
that
the
other
children
must
have
the
disease
she
inoculated
both
and
those
of
the
jailer
all
of
whom
had
it
lightly
except
her
poor
babe
with
whom
the
inoculation
did
not
take
and
who
had
it
the
natural
way
before
this
she
had
been
a
healthy
child
but
it
was
more
than
three
months
before
she
recovered
from
the
dreadful
disorder
the
beneficial
effects
of
inoculation
in
the
case
of
the
children
caused
judson
to
be
called
upon
to
perform
the
operation
upon
all
the
children
in
the
village
judson
gradually
recovered
and
found
his
situation
much
more
comfortable
than
at
ava
but
judson
overcome
by
watchings
fatigue
miserable
food
and
still
more
miserable
lodgings
was
attacked
by
one
of
the
disorders
of
the
country
and
though
much
debilitated
was
obliged
to
set
off
in
a
cart
for
ava
to
procure
medicines
and
suitable
food
while
there
her
disorder
increased
so
fearfully
in
violence
that
she
gave
up
all
hope
of
recovery
and
was
only
anxious
to
return
and
die
near
the
prison
by
the
use
of
laudanum
she
so
far
checked
the
disease
that
she
was
able
to
get
back
to
but
in
such
a
state
that
the
cook
whom
she
had
left
to
supply
her
place
and
who
came
to
help
her
out
of
the
wretched
cart
in
which
she
had
made
part
of
the
journey
was
so
overwhelmed
by
her
altered
and
emaciated
appearance
that
he
burst
into
tears
to
this
poor
cook
she
was
indebted
during
the
next
two
months
for
everything
and
even
for
her
life
and
that
of
those
dearest
to
her
he
would
walk
miles
to
procure
and
carry
food
for
the
prisoners
then
return
to
do
everything
he
could
for
j
though
a
bengalee
he
forgot
his
caste
and
hesitated
not
at
any
office
or
service
which
was
required
of
him
it
was
afterwards
in
their
power
amply
to
reward
him
for
his
labor
of
love
and
they
never
forgot
their
debt
of
gratitude
at
this
time
poor
little
maria
was
the
greatest
sufferer
and
her
mother
anguish
at
seeing
her
distress
while
she
was
unable
to
relieve
it
was
indescribable
deprived
of
her
natural
food
by
her
illness
while
not
a
drop
of
milk
could
be
procured
in
the
village
her
cries
were
sometimes
judson
would
prevail
on
his
keepers
to
let
him
carry
the
emaciated
little
creature
around
in
his
arms
to
beg
nourishment
from
those
mothers
in
the
village
who
had
young
children
now
indeed
was
the
cup
of
misery
full
while
in
health
the
active
ardent
mind
of
judson
bore
up
under
trials
every
new
one
suggesting
some
ingenious
expedient
to
lighten
or
avert
it
but
now
to
see
those
cherished
ones
suffering
and
be
herself
confined
by
sickness
was
almost
too
much
to
bear
it
was
about
this
time
they
learned
the
death
of
their
enemy
whose
elevation
to
power
was
the
cause
of
their
removal
from
ava
and
whose
purpose
in
sending
them
to
was
indeed
their
destruction
suspected
of
and
of
embezzling
public
money
he
was
executed
without
a
moments
delay
another
officer
was
appointed
to
command
the
army
but
with
far
less
sanguine
expectations
of
success
after
his
death
the
prisoners
were
released
from
the
prison
and
conducted
to
ava
the
cause
of
the
change
was
soon
evident
judson
was
wanted
to
act
as
interpreter
between
the
burmese
government
and
the
advancing
army
of
the
british
for
six
weeks
he
was
kept
in
maloun
steadily
at
work
in
translating
and
suffering
as
much
as
when
in
prison
except
that
he
was
not
in
irons
judson
who
had
remained
at
ava
was
seized
soon
after
he
left
her
with
spotted
fever
of
the
most
malignant
character
she
lost
her
reason
and
for
a
long
time
was
insensible
to
everything
around
her
but
she
records
with
lively
gratitude
that
just
before
her
senses
left
her
a
portuguese
woman
had
unexpectedly
come
and
offered
herself
as
nurse
to
her
little
daughter
and
about
the
same
time
price
being
released
from
prison
visited
her
he
represents
her
situation
to
have
been
the
most
distressing
he
ever
witnessed
and
he
had
no
idea
she
could
survive
many
hours
at
one
time
a
burmese
neighbor
who
had
come
in
with
others
to
see
her
die
said
she
is
dead
and
if
the
king
of
angels
were
to
come
in
he
could
not
recover
her
her
head
was
shaved
blisters
were
applied
to
it
and
to
her
feet
and
she
gradually
revived
although
the
fever
having
run
seventeen
days
she
was
of
course
a
long
time
in
recovering
while
in
this
debilitated
state
she
learned
through
her
servant
that
his
master
had
arrived
in
town
under
the
charge
of
several
burmans
and
that
it
was
reported
that
he
was
to
be
sent
back
to
the
prison
being
too
weak
to
bear
ill
tidings
the
shock
had
well
nigh
destroyed
her
when
she
had
in
some
measure
recovered
her
composure
she
sent
moung
ing
to
her
old
friend
the
governor
of
the
north
gate
begging
him
to
make
one
more
effort
for
judson
moung
ing
then
went
in
search
of
teacher
and
at
length
found
him
in
an
obscure
prison
her
feelings
while
he
was
gone
judson
thus
describes
if
ever
i
felt
the
value
and
efficacy
of
prayer
i
did
at
this
time
i
could
not
rise
from
my
couch
i
could
make
no
efforts
to
secure
my
husband
i
could
only
plead
with
that
great
and
powerful
being
who
has
said
upon
me
in
the
day
of
trouble
and
will
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me
and
who
made
me
at
this
time
feel
so
powerfully
this
promise
that
i
became
quite
composed
feeling
assured
that
my
prayers
would
be
answered
she
afterwards
learned
that
as
soon
as
judson
was
found
of
no
farther
use
at
maloun
as
interpreter
he
was
transferred
without
ceremony
to
ava
where
happening
to
meet
no
one
who
knew
him
he
was
ordered
to
be
taken
whence
he
came
when
he
went
to
maloun
viz
but
at
the
instance
of
judson
faithful
messenger
moung
ing
the
governor
of
the
north
gate
presented
a
petition
to
the
high
court
of
the
empire
became
security
for
obtained
his
release
took
him
to
his
house
and
removed
judson
thither
also
as
soon
as
her
health
permitted
the
english
army
which
had
all
along
offered
peace
on
condition
of
the
payment
of
a
certain
sum
of
money
offers
which
the
burmans
had
constantly
rejected
had
now
advanced
so
far
as
to
threaten
the
golden
city
itself
the
burmans
were
thus
compelled
to
negotiate
and
all
their
negotiations
from
beginning
to
end
were
conducted
by
drs
judson
and
price
though
they
were
often
interrupted
or
entirely
broken
off
by
the
caprice
and
jealousy
of
the
burman
monarch
and
his
officers
the
king
placing
no
confidence
in
the
english
and
having
the
most
absurd
ideas
of
his
power
to
force
them
to
his
own
terms
sent
messengers
at
every
stage
of
their
advance
to
induce
sir
archibald
campbell
to
abate
his
demands
and
alter
his
conditions
no
pains
was
spared
to
fortify
the
golden
city
even
while
price
and
other
english
prisoners
were
engaged
in
the
business
of
negotiation
judson
had
the
pain
of
seeing
their
house
without
beautiful
enclosure
of
fruits
and
flowers
entirely
destroyed
to
make
a
place
for
the
erection
of
cannon
a
new
message
now
arrived
from
sir
archibald
no
smaller
sum
than
the
one
stipulated
about
five
million
dollars
would
be
received
but
it
might
be
paid
at
four
different
times
the
first
payment
to
be
made
within
twelve
days
or
the
army
would
continue
its
march
in
addition
the
prisoners
were
to
be
given
up
immediately
the
king
who
had
learned
the
value
of
judson
services
declared
that
those
foreigners
who
were
not
english
were
his
people
and
should
not
go
the
missionaries
were
ordered
to
go
again
to
the
english
camp
to
propose
to
them
to
take
a
third
of
the
money
and
give
up
their
demand
for
the
missionaries
and
threatened
that
if
unsuccessful
in
their
embassy
they
and
their
families
should
suffer
their
situation
was
now
truly
perilous
for
the
burman
arrogance
was
at
this
time
heightened
by
the
boast
of
one
of
their
generals
that
he
would
so
fortify
the
ancient
city
of
pugan
which
lay
in
the
route
of
the
british
toward
ava
that
they
could
never
advance
beyond
it
and
that
in
fact
he
would
destroy
or
drive
them
from
the
country
the
invincible
english
took
the
city
however
with
perfect
ease
and
the
king
being
enraged
that
he
had
listened
for
a
moment
to
the
braggart
and
thus
provoked
the
british
officers
had
him
executed
without
ceremony
and
gave
out
that
it
was
to
punish
him
for
violating
his
command
to
fight
the
english
the
same
night
price
was
sent
with
part
of
the
money
and
some
of
the
prisoners
but
returned
with
the
alarming
intelligence
that
the
general
was
angry
would
not
communicate
with
him
and
was
marching
upon
ava
all
was
now
confusion
in
the
palace
gold
and
silver
vessels
were
melted
up
and
the
money
weighed
out
and
judson
was
hurried
into
a
boat
and
sent
to
the
british
camp
he
was
instructed
by
the
english
general
that
every
foreigner
who
to
leave
the
country
must
be
permitted
to
go
or
peace
would
not
be
made
the
members
of
government
now
had
recourse
to
solicitation
and
promised
to
make
judson
a
great
man
if
he
would
remain
to
avoid
the
oduim
of
expressing
a
wish
to
leave
his
majesty
service
he
told
them
that
sir
archibald
had
ordered
that
all
who
desired
it
should
go
that
his
wife
had
often
expressed
that
desire
that
she
therefore
must
be
given
up
and
that
he
must
follow
the
prisoners
were
then
all
released
and
on
a
cool
moonlight
evening
with
hearts
overflowing
with
gratitude
and
joy
they
took
their
passage
down
the
irrawady
bidding
a
final
adieu
to
the
scene
of
their
sufferings
the
city
of
ava
with
what
delight
did
they
the
next
morning
hail
the
sight
of
the
steamboat
that
was
to
conduct
them
to
the
british
camp
with
what
unspeakable
satisfaction
did
they
again
find
themselves
surrounded
by
the
comforts
and
refinements
of
civilized
life
the
kindness
of
general
campbell
was
more
like
that
of
a
father
to
his
own
family
than
that
of
a
stranger
to
persons
of
another
country
indeed
it
was
to
him
they
owed
their
final
release
from
ava
and
the
recovery
of
all
their
confiscated
property
judson
thinks
no
people
on
earth
were
ever
happier
than
they
were
at
that
time
the
very
idea
that
they
were
free
from
burman
treachery
and
tyranny
and
under
british
protection
filling
them
with
gratitude
and
joy
too
exquisite
for
expression
what
shall
we
render
to
the
lord
for
all
his
benefits
to
us
was
the
constant
utterance
of
their
hearts
peace
was
soon
settled
they
left
the
camp
and
after
an
absence
of
two
years
and
three
months
were
again

death

concludes
her

most
interesting
letter
to
her

as
follows
a

of
our
trip

and
adventures
in

suggests
the
inquiry
why
were
we
permitted
to
go
what
good
has
been
effected
why
did
i
not
listen
to
the
advice
of
friends
in

concluded

all
that
we
can
say
is
is
not
in
man
that
walketh
to
direct
his
so
far
as
my
going
round
to
rangoon
at
the
time
i
did
was
instrumental
in
bringing
those
heavy
afflictions
upon
us
i
can
only
state
that
if
ever
i
acted
from
a
sense
of
duty
in
my
life
it
was
at
that
time
for
my
conscience
would
not
allow
me
any
peace
when
i
thought
of
sending
for
your
brother
to
calcutta
in
prospect
of
the
approaching
war
our
society
at
home
have
lost
no
property
on
account
of
our
difficulties
but
two
years
of
precious
time
have
been
lost
to
the
mission
unless
some
future
advantage
may
be
gained
in
consequence
of
the
severe
discipline
to
which
we
ourselves
have
been
subject
we
are
sometimes
induced
to
think
that
the
lesson
we
have
found
so
very
hard
to
learn
will
have
a
beneficial
effect
through
our
lives
and
that
the
mission
may
in
the
end
be
advanced
rather
than
retarded
in
reference
to
this
timid
and
hesitating
hope
of
some
benefit
which
accrue
to
the
cause
of
missions
from
her
terrible
experience
the
remarks
of
dowling
in
a
recent
work
are
so
appropriate
that
we
will
introduce
them
here
previous
to
the
commencement
of
these
sufferings
though
a
few
american
baptists
were
partially
awake
to
the
salvation
of
the
heathen
yet
the
contributions
for
the
mission
were
meagre
and
the
interest
it
had
excited
was
comparatively
small
something
of
a
thrilling
exciting
character
was
needed
to
arouse
the
churches
from
their
indifference
and
lethargy
something
that
should
touch
their
hearts
by
showing
them
somewhat
of
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
sacrifices
made
by
those
devoted
missionaries
whom
they
were
called
upon
to
sustain
by
their
benefactions
and
their
prayers
such
a
stimulus
was
afforded
when
after
two
years
of
painful
suspense
during
which
it
was
not
known
whether
the
missionaries
were
dead
or
alive
the
touching
recital
of
their
unparalleled
sufferings
for
christ
sake
and
of
their
wonderful
deliverance
at
length
burst
like
an
electric
shock
upon
the
american
churches
and
that
shock
has
not
yet
spent
its
force
as
we
have
recently
seen
in
the
effect
produced
by
the
simple
silent
presence
in
the
assemblies
of
the
saints
of
the
venerated
man
of
god
who
can
say
with
an
apostle
bear
in
my
body
the
scars
of
the
lord
jesus
that
worn
veteran
had
but
to
arise
in
a
christian
assembly
and
a
thrill
of
sympathy
was
sent
through
the
audience
and
thousands
upon
thousands
of
dollars
were
pledged
on
the
spot
to
that
cause
which
his
silent
presence
so
powerfully
advocated
another
consequence
of
the
war
was
to
secure
british
toleration
and
protection
to
a
large
territory
hitherto
almost
inaccessible
to
the
missionaries
of
this
we
shall
speak
more
fully
hereafter
judson
proceeds
we
should
have
had
no
hesitation
about
remaining
at
ava
if
no
part
of
the
burman
empire
had
been
ceded
to
the
british
but
as
it
was
we
felt
that
it
would
be
unnecessary
exposure
besides
the
missionary
field
being
more
limited
in
consequence
of
intoleration
we
now
consider
our
future
missionary
prospects
as
bright
indeed
and
our
only
anxiety
is
to
be
once
more
in
that
situation
when
our
time
will
be
exclusively
devoted
to
the
instruction
of
the
heathen
this
letter
dreadful
as
are
the
scenes
herein
described
gives
you
but
a
faint
idea
of
the
awful
reality
the
anguish
the
agony
of
mind
resulting
from
a
thousand
little
circumstances
impossible
to
delineate
on
paper
can
be
known
by
those
only
who
have
been
in
similar
situations
pray
for
us
my
dear
brother
and
sister
that
these
heavy
afflictions
may
not
be
in
vain
but
may
be
blessed
to
our
spiritual
good
and
the
advancement
of
christ
church
among
the
heathen
the
following
is
extracted
from
a
tribute
to
judson
which
appeared
in
a
calcutta
paper
after
the
war
it
was
written
by
a
of
j
judson
was
the
author
of
those
eloquent
and
forcible
appeals
to
the
government
which
prepared
them
by
degrees
for
submission
to
terms
of
peace
never
expected
by
any
who
knew
the
haughtiness
and
inflexible
pride
of
the
burman
court
and
while
on
this
subject
the
overflowings
of
grateful
feelings
on
behalf
of
myself
and
compel
me
to
add
a
tribute
of
public
thanks
to
that
amiable
and
humane
female
who
though
living
at
a
distance
of
two
miles
from
our
prison
without
any
means
of
conveyance
and
very
feeble
in
health
forgot
her
own
comfort
and
infirmity
and
almost
every
day
visited
us
sought
out
and
administered
to
our
wants
and
contributed
in
every
way
to
alleviate
our
misery
when
we
were
all
left
by
the
government
destitute
of
food
she
with
unwearied
perseverance
by
some
means
or
other
obtained
for
us
a
constant
supply
when
the
unfeeling
avarice
of
our
keepers
confined
us
inside
or
made
our
feet
fast
in
the
stocks
she
like
a
ministering
angel
never
ceased
her
applications
to
the
government
until
she
was
authorized
to
communicate
to
us
the
grateful
news
of
our
enlargement
or
of
a
respite
from
our
galling
oppressions
besides
all
this
it
was
unquestionably
owing
in
a
chief
degree
to
the
repeated
eloquence
and
forcible
appeals
of
judson
that
the
untutored
burman
was
finally
made
willing
to
secure
the
welfare
of
his
country
by
a
sincere
peace
well
may
professor
gammell
write
of
her
history
has
not
recorded
poetry
itself
has
seldom
portrayed
a
more
affecting
exhibition
of
christian
fortitude
of
female
heroism
and
of
all
the
noble
and
generous
qualities
which
constitute
the
dignity
and
glory
of
woman
in
the
midst
of
sickness
and
danger
and
every
calamity
which
can
crush
the
human
heart
she
presented
a
character
equal
to
the
sternest
trial
and
an
address
and
a
fertility
of
resources
which
gave
her
an
ascendency
over
the
minds
of
her
most
cruel
enemies
and
alone
saved
the
missionaries
and
their
from
the
terrible
doom
which
constantly
awaited
them
we
will
conclude
this
account
of
the
terrible
by
an
extract
from
a
letter
of
judson
dated
rangoon
march
through
the
kind
interposition
of
our
heavenly
father
we
have
been
preserved
in
the
most
imminent
danger
from
the
hand
of
the
executioner
and
in
repeated
instances
of
most
alarming
illness
during
my
protracted
imprisonment
of
one
year
and
seven
months
nine
months
in
three
pairs
of
fetters
two
months
in
five
six
months
in
one
and
two
months
a
prisoner
at
large
the
disciples
and
inquirers
have
been
dispersed
in
all
directions
several
are
dead
has
been
in
the
through
the
whole
and
moung
ing
with
judson
at
ava
i
long
for
the
time
when
we
shall
enjoy
once
more
the
stated
worship
and
ordinances
of
the
lord
house
one
result
of
the
burman
war
was
the
acquisition
by
the
british
of
several
provinces
previously
under
the
government
of
the
king
of
burmah
thus
a
safe
asylum
was
provided
for
the
missionaries
and
for
the
christian
natives
where
they
might
worship
god
in
peace
under
the
shelter
of
the
english
government
one
of
these
provinces
was
fixed
upon
as
the
seat
of
the
mission
and
the
new
town
of
amherst
was
to
be
the
residence
of
the
missionaries
native
christian
families
began
to
assemble
there
and
judson
made
vigorous
preparations
to
open
a
school
crawford
of
the
british
embassy
after
long
solicitation
succeeded
in
persuading
judson
that
by
accompanying
him
in
the
capacity
of
interpreter
to
the
court
of
ava
he
might
secure
to
the
mission
certain
advantages
he
had
long
had
greatly
at
heart
and
he
reluctantly
consented
to
go
leaving
judson
and
her
infant
daughter
in
the
house
of
the
civil
superintendent
at
amherst
he
proceeded
to
the
burman
capital
the
journey
was
every
way
unfortunate
attended
with
long
delays
and
in
its
result
as
far
as
judson
was
concerned
quite
unsuccessful
but
it
was
chiefly
disastrous
because
it
detained
him
from
the
sick
and
dying
bed
of
that
devoted
wife
to
whom
he
was
bound
by
every
tie
that
can
attach
human
hearts
to
each
other
and
compelled
her
to
end
her
troubled
pilgrimage
that
god
who
moves
in
a
mysterious
way
had
ordered
it
that
she
who
had
lived
through
appalling
dangers
and
threatening
deaths
until
her
mission
of
love
toward
those
she
had
cherished
so
fondly
was
accomplished
was
now
that
her
trials
seemed
nearly
ended
and
the
hopes
of
her
heart
seemingly
in
a
train
of
accomplishment
suddenly
called
from
the
scene
of
her
labors
to
that
of
her
exceeding
great
reward
it
was
as
if
a
noble
ship
after
encountering
storms
and
tempests
after
being
often
nearly
wrecked
and
as
often
saved
almost
by
miracle
should
when
already
in
port
and
in
sight
of
anxious
spectators
suddenly
sink
forever
in
a
letter
to
the
corresponding
secretary
dated
ava
judson
writes
the
news
of
the
death
of
my
beloved
wife
has
not
only
thrown
a
gloom
over
all
my
future
prospects
but
has
forever
embittered
the
recollection
of
the
present
journey
in
consequence
of
which
i
have
been
absent
from
her
dying
bed
and
prevented
from
affording
the
spiritual
comfort
which
her
lonely
circumstances
peculiarly
required
and
of
contributing
to
avert
the
fatal
catastrophe
which
has
deprived
me
of
one
of
the
first
of
women
and
best
of
wives
i
commend
myself
and
motherless
child
to
your
sympathy
and
prayers
from
a
letter
from
judson
to
hasseltine
we
learn
that
when
he
parted
from
his
wife
she
was
in
good
health
and
comfortably
situated
with
happy
prospects
of
a
new
field
of
missionary
labor
and
the
expectation
of
seeing
her
husband
again
in
three
or
four
months
at
farthest
his
last
letter
from
her
was
dated
the
of
september
she
says
i
have
this
day
moved
into
the
new
house
and
for
the
first
time
since
we
were
broken
up
at
ava
feel
myself
at
home
the
house
is
large
and
convenient
and
if
you
were
here
i
should
feel
quite
happy
poor
little
maria
is
still
feeble
when
i
ask
her
where
papa
is
she
always
starts
up
and
points
toward
the
sea
the
servants
behave
very
well
and
i
have
no
trouble
about
anything
except
you
and
maria
pray
take
care
of
yourself
may
god
preserve
and
bless
you
and
restore
you
again
to
your
new
and
old
home
is
the
prayer
of
your
affectionate
ann
another
letter
from
a
friend
confirmed
the
statement
with
regard
to
his
wife
health
though
it
spoke
unfavorably
of
that
of
the
child
but
continues
judson
my
next
communication
was
a
letter
with
a
black
seal
handed
me
by
a
person
saying
he
was
sorry
to
inform
me
of
the
death
of
the
child
i
know
not
whether
this
was
a
mistake
on
his
part
or
kindly
intended
to
prepare
my
mind
for
the
real
intelligence
i
went
to
my
room
and
opened
the
letter
with
a
feeling
of
gratitude
and
joy
that
at
any
rate
the
mother
was
spared
it
began
thus
dear
sir
to
one
who
has
suffered
so
much
and
with
such
exemplary
fortitude
there
needs
but
little
preface
to
tell
a
tale
of
distress
it
were
cruel
indeed
to
torture
you
with
doubt
and
suspense
to
sum
up
the
unhappy
tidings
in
a
few
words
judson
is
no
at
intervals
continues
judson
i
got
through
the
dreadful
letter
and
proceed
to
give
you
the
substance
as
indelibly
engraven
on
my
heart
after
adding
that
her
disease
was
a
violent
fever
which
baffled
the
skill
of
the
physicians
and
after
eighteen
days
carried
her
to
the
grave
he
continues
you
perceive
i
have
no
account
whatever
of
the
state
of
her
mind
in
view
of
death
and
eternity
or
of
her
wishes
concerning
her
darling
babe
whom
she
loved
most
intensely
i
will
not
trouble
you
my
dear
mother
with
an
account
of
my
own
private
feelings
the
bitter
anguish
which
for
some
days
would
not
admit
of
mitigation
and
the
comfort
which
the
gospel
subsequently
afforded
the
gospel
of
jesus
christ
which
brings
life
and
immortality
to
light
after
his
return
to
amherst
judson
writes
amid
the
desolation
that
death
has
made
i
take
up
my
pen
to
address
once
more
the
mother
of
my
beloved
ann
i
am
sitting
in
the
house
she
built
in
the
room
where
she
breathed
her
last
and
at
a
window
from
which
i
see
the
tree
that
stands
at
the
head
of
her
grave
and
wade
are
living
in
the
house
having
arrived
here
about
a
month
after
ann
death
and
has
taken
charge
of
my
poor
motherless
maria
when
i
arrived
wade
met
me
at
the
and
as
i
passed
on
to
the
house
one
and
another
of
the
native
christians
came
out
and
when
they
saw
me
they
began
to
weep
at
length
we
reached
the
house
and
i
almost
expected
to
see
my
love
coming
out
to
meet
me
as
usual
but
no
i
only
saw
in
the
arms
of
wade
a
poor
puny
child
who
could
not
recognize
her
father
and
from
whose
infant
mind
had
long
been
erased
all
recollection
of
the
mother
who
loved
her
so
much
she
turned
away
from
me
in
alarm
and
i
obliged
to
seek
comfort
elsewhere
found
my
way
to
the
grave
but
who
ever
obtained
comfort
there
thence
i
went
to
the
house
in
which
i
left
her
and
looked
at
the
spot
where
last
we
knelt
in
prayer
and
where
we
exchanged
the
parting
kiss
it
seems
that
her
head
was
much
affected
and
she
said
but
little
she
sometimes
complained
thus
teacher
is
long
in
coming
and
the
missionaries
are
long
in
coming
i
must
die
alone
and
leave
my
little
one
but
as
it
is
the
will
of
god
i
acquiesce
in
his
will
i
am
not
afraid
of
death
but
i
am
afraid
i
shall
not
be
able
to
bear
these
pains
tell
the
teacher
that
the
disease
was
most
violent
and
i
could
not
write
tell
him
how
i
suffered
and
died
tell
him
all
you
when
she
could
not
notice
anything
else
she
would
still
call
the
child
to
her
and
charge
the
nurse
to
be
kind
to
it
and
indulge
it
in
everything
till
its
father
should
return
the
last
day
or
two
she
lay
almost
senseless
and
motionless
on
one
side
her
head
reclining
on
her
arm
her
eyes
closed
and
at
eight
in
the
evening
with
one
exclamation
of
distress
in
the
burman
language
she
ceased
to
breathe
from
the
physician
who
attended
her
he
afterwards
learned
that
the
fatal
termination
of
her
disease
was
chiefly
owing
to
the
weakness
of
her
constitution
occasioned
by
the
severe
privations
and
sufferings
which
she
endured
at
ava
and
oh
adds
her
husband
with
what
meekness
patience
magnanimity
and
christian
fortitude
she
bore
those
sufferings
and
can
i
wish
they
had
been
less
can
i
sacriligiously
wish
to
rob
her
crown
of
a
single
gem
much
she
saw
and
suffered
of
the
evils
of
this
evil
world
and
eminently
was
she
qualified
to
relish
and
enjoy
the
pure
and
holy
rest
into
which
she
has
entered
true
she
has
been
taken
from
a
sphere
in
which
she
was
singularly
qualified
by
her
natural
disposition
her
winning
manners
her
devoted
zeal
and
her
perfect
acquaintance
with
the
language
to
be
extensively
serviceable
to
the
cause
of
christ
true
she
has
been
torn
from
her
husband
bleeding
heart
and
from
her
darling
babe
but
infinite
wisdom
and
love
have
presided
as
ever
in
this
most
afflicting
dispensation
faith
decides
that
all
is
right
to
show
that
judson
was
already
appreciated
as
she
deserved
by
the
european
society
in
amherst
we
will
subjoin
part
of
a
letter
from
captain
of
that
place
to
a
friend
in
rangoon
i
shall
not
attempt
to
give
you
an
account
of
the
gloom
which
the
death
of
this
amiable
woman
has
thrown
over
our
little
society
you
who
were
so
well
acquainted
with
her
will
feel
her
loss
more
deeply
but
we
had
just
known
her
long
enough
to
value
her
acquaintance
as
a
blessing
in
this
remote
corner
i
dread
the
effect
it
will
have
on
poor
judson
i
am
sure
you
will
take
every
care
that
this
mournful
intelligence
may
be
opened
to
him
as
carefully
as
possible
in
the
of
we
find
this
noble
tribute
to
her
memory
of
judson
little
is
known
in
the
noisy
world
few
comparatively
are
acquainted
with
her
name
few
with
her
actions

rightly
earned
for
herself
the
title
of
a
heroine
judson
has
by
her
doings
and
sufferings
fairly
earned
the
distinction
a
distinction
be
it
said
which
her
true
woman
nature
would
have
very
little
appreciated
still
it
is
right
that
she
should
be
honored
by
the
world
her
sufferings
were
far
more
unendurable
her
heroism
far
more
noble
than
any
which
in
more
recent
times
have
been
so
much
pitied
and
so
much
applauded
but
she
was
a
simple
missionary
wife
an
american
by
birth
and
she
told
her
tale
with
an
artless
modesty
writing
only
what
it
became
her
to
write
treating
only
of
matters
that
became
a
woman
her
captivity
if
so
it
can
be
called
was
voluntarily
endured
she
of
her
own
free
will
shared
the
sufferings
of
her
husband
taking
to
herself
no
credit
for
anything
she
did
putting
her
trust
in
god
and
praying
to
him
to
strengthen
her
human
weakness
she
was
spared
to
breathe
once
again
the
free
air
of
liberty
but
her
troubles
had
done
the
work
of
death
on
her
delicate
frame
and
she
was
soon
translated
to
heaven
she
was
the
real
heroine

assuages

that

to

of

or

who
has
manifested

intellectual
or

power
whether

toward

the
active

are
roused

contemplation
of
high
achievement
kindles
emulation
and
well
would
it
be
were
the
character
of
those
leading
minds
which
thus
draw
after
them
the
mass
of
mankind
always
virtuous
and
noble
but
in
the
vast
majority
of
instances
the
leaders
of
mankind
are
individuals
whose
principles
and
motives
the
christian
must
condemn
as
hostile
to
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
more
precious
therefore
is
the
example
of
that
pious
few
who
have
devoted
themselves
with
pure
hearts
fervently
to
the
glory
of
god
and
the
good
of
man
and
whose
energy
of
purpose
and
firmness
of
principle
and
magnanimity
in
despising
difficulty
and
danger
and
suffering
and
death
in
the
accomplishment
of
a
noble
end
rouse
into
active
admiration
all
who
contemplate
their
glorious
career
such
a
career
was
that
of
the
honored
missionary
whose
life
has
been
sketched
in
the
former
part
of
this
volume
and
such
too
was
hers
who
forms
the
subject
of
the
present
memoir
sarah
b
hall
was
the
eldest
of
thirteen
children
her
parents
were
ralph
and
abiah
hall
who
removed
during
her
infancy
from
alstead
new
hampshire
the
place
of
her
birth
to
salem
in
the
state
of
massachusetts
her
parents
not
being
wealthy
she
was
early
trained
to
those
habits
of
industry
thoughtfulness
and
which
distinguished
her
through
life
children
so
situated
are
sometimes
pitied
by
those
who
consider
childhood
as
the
proper
season
for
careless
mirth
and
reckless
glee
but
they
often
form
characters
of
solid
excellence
rarely
possessed
by
those
to
whom
fortune
has
been
more
indulgent
their
struggle
with
obstacles
in
the
way
of
improvement
and
final
triumph
over
them
is
an
invaluable
preparation
for
the
rude
conflicts
of
life
their
ingenuity
is
quickened
by
the
hourly
necessity
of
expedients
to
meet
emergencies
and
the
many
trials
which
are
unavoidable
in
their
circumstances
and
which
must
be
met
with
energy
and
resolution
give
habits
of
patient
endurance
and
noble
courage
from
all
the
accounts
which
we
have
of
her
sarah
must
have
been
a
most
engaging
child
gentle
and
affectionate
in
disposition
and
persuasive
and
winning
in
manners
there
was
yet
an
ardor
and
enthusiasm
in
her
character
combined
with
a
quiet
firmness
and
perseverance
that
ensured
success
in
whatever
she
attempted
and
gave
promise
of
the
lofty
excellence
to
which
she
afterwards
attained
all
who
have
sketched
her
character
notice
one
peculiarity
and
it
is
one
which
commonly
attends
high
merit
her
modest
unobtrusiveness
she
was
very
fond
of
little
children
and
easily
won
their
affections
but
showed
little
disposition
even
in
childhood
to
mingle
in
the
sports
of
those
of
her
own
age
this
arose
from
no
want
of
cheerfulness
in
her
bosom
but
from
a
certain
thoughtfulness
and
fondness
for
intellectual
exercises
which
were
early
developed
in
her
character
her
principle
as
well
as
her
fondness
for
her
mother
led
her
never
to
shrink
from
what
are
termed
domestic
duties
but
her
heart
was
not
in
them
as
it
was
in
study
and
meditation
an
illustration
of
this
trait
was
recently
related
by
her
brother
sarah
was
repeating
some
lines
on
the
death
of
nancy
cornelius
which
attracted
the
attention
of
her
mother
who
asked
her
where
she
had
learned
them
with
some
hesitation
the
child
confessed
that
she
had
composed
them
the
day
before
while
engaged
in
some
domestic
avocation
during
which
her
unusual
abstracedness
had
been
noticed
her
early
poetical
attempts
evince
uncommon
facility
in
versification
and
talent
that
if
cultivated
might
have
placed
her
high
in
the
ranks
of
those
who
have
trod
the
flowery
paths
of
literature
but
hers
was
a
higher
vocation
and
poetry
which
was
the
delightful
recreation
of
her
childhood
and
never
utterly
neglected
in
her
riper
years
was
never
to
her
anything
than
a
recreation
her
effusions
at
the
age
of
thirteen
are
truly
remarkable
when
we
consider
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
written
one
which
is
given
by
her
biographer
as
it
was
probably
amended
by
the
taste
of
later
years
now
lies
before
me
as
it
was
first
written
and
the
improved
copy
though
greatly
superior
in
beauty
to
the
first
seems
to
me
to
lack
the
vigor
and
energy
which
more
than
atone
for
the
many
blemishes
of
the
other
our
readers
shall
judge
we
insert
the
composition
the
other
is
to
be
found
in
her
graceful
memoir
by
forrester
she
calls
it
a
versification
of

over
saul

jonathan

of
a

will
here
insert
not

for
their
merit

to
show
what
those
powers
were

she
sacrificed

sarah
from
her
earliest
years
took
great
delight
in
reading
at
four
years
says
her
brother
she
could
read
readily
in
any
common
book
her
rank
in
her
classes
in
school
was
always
high
and
her
teachers
felt
a
pleasure
in
instructing
her
on
one
occasion
when
about
thirteen
she
was
compelled
to
signify
to
the
principal
of
a
female
seminary
that
her
circumstances
would
no
longer
permit
her
to
enjoy
its
advantages
the
teacher
unwilling
to
lose
a
pupil
who
was
an
honor
to
the
school
and
who
so
highly
appreciated
its
privileges
remonstrated
with
her
upon
her
intention
and
finally
prevailed
on
her
to
remain
soon
after
she
commenced
instructing
a
class
of
small
children
and
was
thus
enabled
to
keep
her
situation
in
the
seminary
without
sacrificing
her
feelings
of
independence
her
earliest
journals
fragmentary
as
they
are
disclose
a
zeal
and
ardor
in
exceedingly
unusual
my
mother
can
not
spare
me
to
attend
school
this
winter
but
i
have
begun
to
pursue
my
studies
at
home
again
my
parents
are
not
in
a
situation
to
send
me
to
school
this
summer
so
i
must
make
every
exertion
in
my
power
to
improve
at
home
again
in
a
note
to
a
little
friend
i
feel
very
anxious
to
adopt
some
plan
for
our
mutual
improvement
how
touching
are
these
simple
expressions
how
severely
do
they
rebuke
the
apathy
of
thousands
of
young
persons
who
allow
golden
opportunities
of
improvement
to
slip
away
from
then
forever
opportunities
which
to
sarah
hall
and
such
as
she
were
of
priceless
value
yet
it
is
not
one
of
the
least
of
the
with
which
the
providence
of
god
abounds
that
the
very
lack
of
favorable
circumstances
is
sometimes
favorable
to
the
development
of
latent
resources
thus
it
was
with
sarah
her
whole
career
shows
that
her
mind
had
been
early
trained
and
disciplined
in
that
noblest
of
all
schools

school

a
degree
not
usual
sarah
knew
that
yet
one
thing
she
lacked
and
this
knowledge
often
disquieted
her
but
her
first
deep
and
decided
convictions
of
sin
seem
to
have
been
produced
about
the
year
under
the
preaching
of
cornelius
her
struggles
of
mind
were
fearful
and
she
sunk
almost
to
the
verge
of
despair
but
hope
dawned
at
last
and
she
was
enabled
to
consecrate
her
whole
being
to
the
service
of
her
maker
she
soon
after
united
with
the
first
baptist
church
in
salem
under
the
care
of
bolles
the
missionary
spirit
was
early
developed
in
her
heart
even
before
her
conversion
her
mind
was
often
exercised
with
sentiments
of
commiseration
for
the
situation
of
ignorant
heathen
and
idolaters
and
after
that
event
it
was
the
leading
idea
of
her
life
the
cause
of
this
early
bias
is
unknown
but
it
was
shown
in
her
conversations
her
letters
and
notes
to
friends
and
in
her
early
poetical
effusions
she
even
tremblingly
investigated
her
own
fitness
to
became
a
vessel
of
mercy
to
the
far
off
perishing
heathen
and
then
shrinking
from
what
seemed
to
her
the
presumptuous
thought
she
gave
herself
with
new
zeal
to
the
work
of
benefitting
these
immediately
around
her
shortly
after
her
conversion
says
her
brother
she
observed
the
destitute
condition
of
the
children
in
the
neighborhood
in
which
she
resided
with
the
assistance
of
some
young
friends
as
teachers
she
organized
and
continued
through
the
favorable
portions
of
the
year
a
of
which
she
assumed
the
responsibility
of
superintendent
and
at
the
usual
annual
celebrations
she
with
her
teachers
and
scholars
joined
in
the
exercises
which
accompany
that
festival
it
is
my
ardent
desire
she
writes
to
a
friend
that
the
glorious
work
of
reformation
may
extend
till
shall
bow
to
the
living
god
for
this
expected
this
promised
era
let
us
pray
earnestly
unceasingly
and
with
faith
how
can
i
be
so
inactive
when
i
know
that
thousands
are
perishing
in
this
land
of
grace
and
millions
in
other
lands
are
at
this
very
moment
kneeling
before
senseless
idols
and
in
her
journal
sinners
perishing
all
around
me
and
i
almost
panting
to
tell
the
far
of
christ
surely
this
is
wrong
i
will
no
longer
indulge
the
vain
foolish
wish
but
endeavor
to
be
useful
in
the
position
where
providence
has
placed
me
i
can
for
deluded
idolaters
and
for
those
who
labor
among
them
and
this
is
a
privilege
indeed
this
strong
bias
of
her
mind
toward
a
missionary
life
was
well
known
to
her
mother
who
still
remembers
with
a
tender
interest
an
incident
connected
with
it
sarah
had
been
deeply
affected
by
the
death
of
colman
who
in
the
midst
of
his
labors
among
the
heathen
had
suddenly
been
called
to
his
reward
some
time
afterward
she
returned
from
an
evening
meeting
and
with
a
countenance
radiant
with
joy
announced
what
her
pastor
had
mentioned
in
the
meeting
that
a
successor
to
colman
had
been
found
young
man
in
maine
named
had
determined
to
raise
and
bear
to
pagan
burmah
the
standard
which
had
fallen
from
his
dying
hand
with
that
maternal
instinct
which
sometimes
forebodes
a
future
calamity
however
improbable
her
mother
turned
away
from
her
daughter
joyous
face
for
the
thought
flashed
involuntarily
through
her
mind
that
the
young
missionary
would
seek
as
a
companion
of
his
toils
a
kindred
spirit
and
where
would
he
find
one
so
congenial
as
the
lovely
being
before
her
her
fears
were
realized
some
lines
written
by
the
enthusiastic
sarah
on
the
death
of
colman
met
the
eye
of
the
young
man
in
maine
who
was
touched
and
interested
by
the
spirit
which
breathes
in
them
and
did
not
rest
till
he
had
formed
an
acquaintance
with
their
author
this
acquaintance
was
followed
by
an
engagement
and
in
about
two
years
sarah
ardent
aspirations
were
gratified
she
was
a
missionary
to
the
heathen
but
we
are
anticipating
events
and
will
close
this
chapter
with
extracts
from
the
lines
on
the
death
of
colman
of
which
we
have
spoken
is
the
voice
of
deep
sorrow
from
india
shore
the
flower
of
our
churches
is
withered
is
dead
the
gem
that
shone
brightly
will
sparkle
no
more
and
the
tears
of
the
christian
profusely
are
shed
two
youths
of
columbia
with
hearts
glowing
warm
embarked
on
the
billows
far
distant
to
rove
to
bear
to
the
nations
all
wrapp
in
thick
gloom
the
lamp
of
the
gospel
the
message
of
love
but
wheelock
now
slumbers
beneath
the
cold
wave
and
colman
lies
low
in
the
dark
cheerless
grave
mourn
daughters
of
india
mourn
the
rays
of
that
star
clear
and
bright
that
so
sweetly
on
arracan
shone
are
shrouded
in
black
clouds
of
night
for
colman
is
gone
oh
colman
thy
father
weeps
not
thy
grave
thy
heart
riven
mother
sighs
thy
dust
but
the
long
indian
grass
thy
far
tomb
shall
wave
and
the
drops
of
the
evening
descend
on
the
just
cold
silent
and
dark
is
thy
narrow
abode
but
not
long
wilt
thou
sleep
in
that
dwelling
of
gloom
for
soon
shall
be
heard
the
great
trump
of
our
god
to
summon
all
nations
to
hear
their
last
doom
a
garland
of
amaranth
then
shall
be
thine
and
thy
name
on
the
martyrs
bright
register
shine
o
what
glory
will
burst
on
thy
view
when
are
placed
by
the
judge
of

in

chapter
iii
account
of
george
dana
boardman
we
need
offer
no
apology
for
turning
aside
from
the
immediate
subject
of
our
narrative
in
order
to
introduce
to
our
readers
one
who
must
henceforth
share
with
her
our
sympathy
and
our
affection
we
mean
george
dana
boardman
the
successor
to
colman
spoken
of
in
the
last
chapter
he
was
the
son
of
a
baptist
clergyman
in
livermore
maine
and
was
born
in
though
feeble
in
body
he
had
an
ardent
thirst
for
knowledge
which
often
made
him
conceal
illness
for
fear
of
being
detained
from
school
at
a
suitable
age
he
was
sent
to
an
academy
in
north
yarmouth
where
he
became
distinguished
for
ardor
in
the
pursuit
of
learning
and
fine
mental
powers
it
is
related
that
he
went
through
the
latin
grammar
with
surprising
rapidity
and
then
expected
to
be
allowed
to
use
the
lexicon
but
was
told
he
must
go
through
the
grammar
once
or
twice
more
disappointed
he
returned
to
his
seat
and
in
an
hour
or
two
was
called
up
to
recite
when
he
repeated
verbatim
sixteen
pages
of
the
grammar
his
preceptor
inquired
if
he
had
got
more
he
answered
yes
and
on
being
asked
how
much
replied
i
can
recite
the
whole
book
sir
if
you
wish
he
afterwards
manifested
equal
power
in
mathematics
at
sixteen
he
engaged
in
in
order
to
obtain
means
for
a
collegiate
course
the
great
object
of
his
ambition
and
in
this
employment
he
manifested
a
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
of
the
influences
which
control
it
truly
wonderful
the
most
turbulent
and
disorderly
schools
became
in
his
hands
models
of
system
and
regularity
in
when
years
old
he
entered
waterville
college
maine
he
was
at
this
time
a
youth
of
good
principles
inflexible
purpose
strong
affections
and
independent
opinions
but
had
hitherto
given
no
evidence
of
piety
but
in
this
institution
his
thoughts
were
directed
by
a
variety
of
circumstances
to
a
consideration
of
the
vast
and
important
topics
of
evangelical
religion
his
was
a
very
pious
and
most
man
the
officers
of
the
college
did
all
in
their
power
to
elevate
his
thoughts
and
affections
in
short
every
external
influence
with
which
a
young
man
could
be
surrounded
was
calculated
to
lead
his
mind
heavenward
under
the
operation
of
these
causes
he
was
by
the
spirit
of
god
induced
to
consecrate
himself
soul
body
and
spirit
to
religion
and
in
he
made
a
public
profession
of
his
belief
and
was
baptized
from
his
letters
and
journals
we
find
that
he
soon
turned
his
thoughts
to
the
subject
of
missions
in
the
winter
of
he
says
the
thought
occurred
to
me
that
i
could
take
my
bible
and
travel
through
new
settlements
where
the
gospel
was
seldom
or
never
heard
and
sustaining
the
name
of
a
could
visit
from
hut
to
hut
and
tell
the
story
of
jesus
dying
love
then
in
imagination
i
could
welcome
fatigue
hunger
cold
solitude
sickness
and
death
if
i
could
only
win
a
few
cottagers
to
my
beloved
saviour
when
the
news
of
the
death
of
judson
fellow
missionary
colman
reached
america
his
soul
was
filled
with
desire
to
supply
the
place
of
that
beloved
laborer
in
the
burman
field
still
his
chief
aim
was
to
leave
the
of
his
labors
entirely
to
the
guidance
of
providence
on
graduating
at
college
he
accepted
the
office
of
tutor
in
it
for
one
year
and
so
great
was
the
promise
of
his
future
eminence
that
the
good
president
predicted
that
he
would
at
a
future
day
preside
over
the
institution
but
his
heart
was
fixed
on
other
labor
and
as
soon
as
his
engagement
was
completed
he
hastened
to
offer
his
services
to
the
board
of
foreign
missions
and
was
at
once
accepted
as
a
missionary
the
parting
scene
between
boardman
and
his
religious
friends
in
waterville
who
had
assembled
to
bid
him
farewell
is
said
by
one
present
on
that
occasion
to
have
been
exceedingly
touching
the
eye
of
boardman
was
alone
undimmed
by
a
tear
in
a
tender
and
yet
unfaltering
tone
he
addressed
a
few
words
to
his
brethren
we
all
knelt
down
in
prayer
together
for
the
last
time
on
arising
boardman
passed
round
the
room
and
gave
to
each
his
hand
for
the
last
time
his
countenance
was
serene
his
mild
blue
eye
beamed
with
benignity
and
though
there
was
in
his
manner
a
tenderness
which
showed
he
had
a
heart
to
feel
yet
there
was
no
visible
emotion
till
he
came
to
his
as
he
took
by
the
hand
his
whole
frame
became
convulsed
his
eye
filled
and
the
tears
fell
fast
as
if
all
the
tender
feelings
of
his
spirit
till
now
imprisoned
had
at
this
moment
broken
forth
he
faltered
and
then
smiling
through
his
tears
said
as
he
left
the
room
shall
meet
again
in
heaven
he
had
expected
immediately
to
leave
america
for
burmah
in
the
same
ship
which
was
to
take
judson
back
to
that
country
but
the
board
decided
to
detain
him
some
time
in
this
country
for
further
preparation
in
june
he
entered
on
theological
studies
in
the
seminary
at
andover
and
employed
all
his
leisure
hours
in
reading
those
books
in
the
library
which
treated
of
the
manners
customs
and
religions
of
heathen
countries
in
the
spring
of
he
was
called
to
bid
his
country
farewell
natural
affection
was
strong
but
the
call
of
duty
was
stronger
still
in
a
letter
he
says
if
tenderness
of
feeling
if
ardor
of
affection
if
attachment
to
friends
to
christian
society
and
christian
privileges
if
apprehension
of
toil
and
danger
in
a
missionary
life
if
an
overwhelming
sense
of
responsibility
could
detain
me
in
america
i
should
never
go
to
burmah
and
in
his
journal
welcome
separations
and
farewells
welcome
tears
welcome
last
sad
embraces
welcome
pangs
and
griefs
only
let
me
go
where
my
saviour
calls
and
goes
himself
welcome
toils
disappointments
fatigues
and
sorrows
welcome
an
early
grave
it
is
easy
to
imagine
that
the
sympathy
and
affection
between
two
souls
constituted
like
miss
hall
and
boardman
both
of
whom
were
warmed
by
the
same
zeal
for
the
cause
of
christ
and
the
welfare
of
the
heathen
would
be
unusually
strong
and
indeed
there
is
every
evidence
that
from
the
time
they
became
fully
acquainted
the
most
tender
attachment
subsisted
between
them
you
know
she
wrote
long
afterward
to
her
mother
how
tenderly
i
loved
him
and
to
an
intimate
friend
he
said
in
a
private
conversation
it
was
not
the
superiority
of
her
personal
charms
though
these
were
by
no
means
small
but
it
was
her
intrinsic
excellence
heightened
by
her
modest
unobtrusive
spirit
that
endeared
her
to
my
heart

on

thy
feet

rove

raise
thine
eye
where
in
holy
love
i
wait
to
hail
thee
to
the
sky
on
the
of
july
the
marriage
took
place
miss
hall
being
then
years
old
and
boardman
his
slender
figure
and
transparent
complexion
even
then
seemed
to
indicate
that
his
mission
on
earth
might
soon
be
fulfilled
but
both
he
and
his
bride
were
young
and
sanguine
and
no
misgivings
for
the
future
disturbed
their
happiness
in
each
other
indeed
the
grief
of
parting
with
all
they
had
ever
loved
and
cherished
though
chastened
by
submission
to
what
they
believed
the
divine
call
was
sufficient
to
merge
all
lighter
causes
of
anxiety
on
the
day
following
their
marriage
they
left
salem
for
the
place
of
embarkation
they
were
to
sail
first
to
calcutta
and
if
on
reaching
there
the
troubles
in

should
prevent
their
going
at
once
to
that
country
they
were
to
remain
in
calcutta
and
apply
themselves
to
the
acquisition
of
the
burman
language
in
expectation
of
their
speedy
departure
meetings
for
special
prayer
were
held
at
boston
salem
new
york
and
philadelphia
the
spirit
which
animated
these
meetings
and
breathed
in
all
the
supplications
offered
was
indicative
of
deep
interest
in
the
mission
and
of
united
and
determined
resolution
by
the
grace
of
god
to
support
it
and
were
everywhere
received
with
the
utmost
kindness
and
nothing
was
withheld
which
could
contribute
to
animate
them
in
their
arduous
undertaking
and
render
their
future
voyage
pleasant
and
healthful
the
captain
and
other
officers
of
the
ship
asia
in
which
they
were
to
sail
made
the
most
ample
provision
for
their
comfort
and
accommodation
and
rendered
them
every
attention
in
a
manner
most
grateful
to
their
feelings
at
a
concert
of
prayer
in
philadelphia
boardman
was
called
upon
to
give
a
brief
account
to
the
audience
of
the
motives
which
had
induced
him
to
devote
his
life
to
the
missionary
service
in
his
reply
he
took
occasion
in
the
first
place
to
acknowledge
the
goodness
of
god
to
him
through
his
whole
life
when
he
entered
waterville
college
the
first
student
ever
admitted
there
not
hopefully
pious
his
impressed
with
this
fact
solemnly
engaged
with
each
other
unknown
to
him
to
remember
him
in
their
supplications
until
their
prayers
for
his
conversion
should
be
answered
six
months
from
that
time
he
found
peace
in
believing
and
his
first
prayer
was
that
god
would
make
him
useful
his
mind
was
so
impressed
with
the
condition
of
our
indian
tribes
that
he
felt
inclined
to
carry
to
them
the
message
of
salvation
but
his
venerable
father
whom
he
consulted
as
to
his
duty
advised
him
to
wait
on
god
and
he
would
conduct
him
in
the
right
way
after
some
time
his
choice
was
decided
in
favor
of
the
burman
mission
by
such
indications
that
he
considered
his
call
to
this
service
distinctly
and
plainly
marked
he
adverted
in
a
very
tender
manner
to
some
peculiar
indications
of
providence
especially
to
the
manner
in
which
his
parents
received
the
knowledge
of
his
determination
their
remark
was
has
long
been
our
desire
to
do
something
for
the
mission
and
if
god
will
accept
our
son
we
make
the
surrender
with
in
reading
this
account
do
we
not
feel
emotions
of
moral
sublimity
in
contemplating
these
tender
and
aged
parents
who
moved
with
love
for
a
benevolent
god
and
for
their
surrender
their
son
bright
with
talents
and
virtues
rich
in
learning
and
in
the
respect
of
all
who
knew
him
but
feeble
and
sickly
in
body
to
the
missionary
labor
whose
certain
and
speedy
end
is
death
boardman
with
her
husband
took
her
final
leave
of
her
beloved
native
land
on
the
of
july
to
her
sister
when
two
weeks
out
at
sea
she
writes
we
think
we
never
enjoyed
better
health
that
beneficent
parent
who
is
ever
doing
us
good
has
bestowed
upon
us
in
the
officers
of
the
ship
obliging
and
affectionate
friends
everything
regarding
our
table
is
convenient
and
agreeable
as
we
could
enjoy
on
shore
our
family
consists
of
the
captain
two
mates
two
supercargoes
a
physician
fowler
and
ourselves
blaikie
the
chief
supercargo
is
not
only
a
gentleman
but
is
decidedly
pious
and
strictly
evangelical
in
his
sentiments
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
each
of
us
to
find
one
who
is
ever
ready
to
converse
upon
those
subjects
which
relate
to
the
extension
of
the
redeemer
kingdom
it
is
most
grateful
to
my
own
feelings
but
i
am
even
more
rejoiced
for
the
sake
of
b
religious
society
has
ever
been
to
him
a
source
of
much
real
gratification
you
know
very
well
the
love
he
has
ever
manifested
for
social
intercourse
when
in
america
amidst
our
beloved
friends
as
i
have
seen
him
enter
with
all
his
heart
into
conversation
have
seen
joy
beam
from
his
eyes
when
engaged
in
this
delightful
employment
i
would
sigh
and
say
to
myself
dear
how
sad
you
will
be
when
far
removed
from
those
whose
words
now
so
often
cheer
your
heart
what
will
you
do
when
this
favorite
rill
of
pleasure
ceases
to
flow
but
god
is
infinitely
good
he
is
far
better
to
us
than
our
fears
he
bestows
upon
us
every
blessing
essential
to
our
happiness
and
usefulness
it
is
not
the
of
privileges
that
i
need
lament
but
the
of
them
in
another
letter
she
expresses
her
mature
conviction
that
the
missionary
life
if
entered
upon
with
right
feelings
may
be
more
favorable
than
any
other
to
the
promotion
of
spiritual
growth
and
certain
it
is
that
trials
and
even
persecution
often
develop
the
power
of
christian
principle
and
the
strength
of
religious
faith
while
ease
and
outward
prosperity
seem
to
lull
the
souls
of
believers
into
an
unworthy
sloth
and
a
sinful
conformity
with
the
world
around
them
the
soldier
of
christ
must
maintain
a
warfare
and
when
will
he
be
more
likely
to
be
constantly
awake
to
his
duty
than
when
surrounded
by
the
open
and
avowed
enemies
of
his
master
from
chitpore
four
miles
above
calcutta
boardman
writes
it
gives
me
much
pleasure
to
write
you
from
the
shores
of
india
through
the
goodness
of
god
we
arrived
at
on
the
after
a
voyage
of
days
we
were
slow
in
our
passage
up
the
hoogly
and
did
not
arrive
in
calcutta
until
the
inst
we
had
a
very
agreeable
voyage
religious
service
at
meals
evening
prayers
in
the
cabin
and
when
the
weather
allowed
public
worship
in
the
steerage
on
lord
day
morning
allow
me
to
add
that
we
entertain
a
hope
that
one
of
the
sailors
was
converted
on
the
passage
the
report
of
our
being
at
reached
calcutta
several
days
before
we
did
and
our
friends
had
made
kind
preparations
to
receive
us
soon
after
coming
in
sight
of
the
city
we
had
the
pleasure
of
welcoming
on
board
the
asia
the
rev
hough
he
informed
us
that
the
burmese
war
was
renewed
after
an
armistice
of
several
weeks
and
that
no
accounts
had
been
received
from
our
dear
friends
judson
and
price
at
ava
it
is
generally
supposed
that
they
are
imprisoned
with
other
foreigners
and
have
not
the
means
of
sending
round
to
bengal
at
noon
we
came
on
shore
and
were
received
very
kindly
by
the
english
missionaries
we
found
colman
waiting
with
a
carriage
to
bring
us
out
to
this
place
the
cottage
we
occupy
was
formerly
the
residence
of
and
eustace
carey
and
wade
colman
boardman
and
myself
compose
a
very
happy
american
family
but
we
long
to
be
laboring
in
burmah
we
are
not
yet
discouraged
by
the
dark
cloud
that
hangs
over
our
prospects
there
we
still
hope
and
trust
firmly
that
eventually
this
war
will
tend
to
advance
the
cause
of
christ
in
burmah
we
hope
our
friends
at
home
will
not
be
discouraged
but
will
continue
to
pray
for
us
in
another
letter
he
says
and
now
my
dear
parents
i
wish
you
could
make
a
visit
at
chitpore
you
would
find
your
two
fond
children
sitting
together
very
happily
and
engaged
in
writing
letters
to
their
beloved
american
friends
our
mansion
to
be
sure
is
but
a
bamboo
cottage
with
a
thatched
roof
but
is
a
palace
compared
with
most
of
the
native
huts
around
us
but
you
know
a
large
house
is
by
no
means
essential
to
happiness
food
and
clothing
sufficient
with
the
presence
of
god
are
all
that
is
absolutely
necessary
could
a
man
have
in
addition
one
confidential
friend
who
sympathized
in
all
his
joys
and
sorrows
and
with
whom
he
could
enjoy
all
the
endearments
of
social
life
he
might
be
happy
indeed
and
such
a
friend
such
a
wife
i
have
in
my
beloved
sarah
i
fear
i
shall
never
be
able
to
discharge
the
obligations
i
feel
toward
you
for
conferring
on
me
so
great
a
blessing
also
writes
to
some
acquaintances
unite
with
me
my
respected
friends
in
gratitude
to
god
that
he
has
preserved
us
through
the
dangers
of
a
long
voyage
and
permitted
us
to
land
upon
a
heathen
shore
oh
may
this
renewed
assurance
of
his
kind
care
teach
me
confidence
in
his
promises
and
fill
me
with
ardent
desires
to
be
constantly
employed
in
his
service
our
voyage
was
remarkably
pleasant
our
suffering
from
was
much
lighter
than
we
had
anticipated
our
accommodations
though
by
no
means
handsome
convenient
and
comfortable
as
we
could
desire
our
table
was
well
furnished
with
the
necessaries
and
many
of
the
luxuries
of
life
capt
sheed
and
the
other
gentlemen
on
board
treated
us
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
appeared
solicitous
to
make
our
situation
agreeable
in
the
society
of
blaikie
the
supercargo
we
took
much
delight
he
is
a
gentleman
of
eminent
piety
belonging
to
the
presbyterian
denomination
we
had
evening
devotions
in
the
cabin
when
the
weather
allowed
we
had
divine
service
between
decks
on
the
sabbath
a
precious
privilege
while
at
sea
my
time
was
spent
in
a
very
agreeable
and
i
hope
not
unprofitable
manner
the
principal
books
i
read
besides
the
bible
were
the
life
of
parsons
lowth
lectures
on
hebrew
poetry
part
of
fuller
works
and
of
jones
church
history
supposing
the
study
of
the
word
of
god
well
calculated
to
prepare
my
mind
for
the
missionary
work
i
directed
my
chief
attention
to
that
we
had
one
very
interesting
exercise
during
the
week
several
of
us
collected
as
many
passages
of
scripture
as
we
were
able
upon
a
subject
previously
named
and
on
sabbath
eve
we
compared
our
separate
lists
and
conversed
freely
upon
the
doctrine
or
duty
concerning
which
we
had
written
in
this
manner
we
discussed
many
of
the
most
important
doctrines
and
duties
contained
in
scripture
as
we
drew
near
calcutta
our
anxiety
respecting
the
fate
of
our
dear
missionaries
at
ava
increased
we
trembled
when
we
thought
of
the
disturbances
in
burmah
and
there
was
only
one
spot
where
we
could
find
peace
and
serenity
of
mind
that
sweet
spot
was
the
throne
of
grace
thither
we
would
often
repair
and
lose
all
anxiety
and
fear
respecting
our
dear
friends
our
own
future
prospects
and
the
missionary
cause
in
burmah
it
was
sweet
to
commit
all
into
the
hands
of
god
if
not
deceived
we
felt
the
importance
of
constantly
pleading
for
a
suitable
frame
of
mind
to
receive
whatever
intelligence
was
for
us
and
for
a
disposition
to
engage
in
the
service
of
god
at
any
time
and
in
any
place
he
might
direct
we
considered
it
our
duty
to
supplicate
for
grace
to
support
us
in
the
hour
of
trial
and
for
direction
in
time
of
perplexity
rather
than
to
employ
our
minds
in
anticipating
the
nature
of
future
difficulties
and
in
fancying
how
we
should
conduct
in
an
imagined
perplexity
this
is
still
our
opinion
then
follows
an
account
of
their
arrival
which
we
have
already
given
in
boardman
letter
and
she
adds
imagine
dear
our
joy
at
meeting
those
with
whom
we
hope
to
be
employed
in
labors
of
love
among
the
poor
burmans
i
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
the
emotions
of
my
heart
when
i
entered
the
little
bamboo
cottage
we
now
occupy
were
i
skilled
in
perspective
drawing
i
would
send
you
a
picture
of
the
charming
landscape
seen
from
our
verandah
in
a
little
hut
near
us
reside
two
christian
converts
from
heathenism
oh
how
your
bosom
would
glow
with
grateful
rapture
to
hear
their
songs
of
praise
and
listen
to
their
fervent
prayers
we
prefer
living
in
this
retired
spot
with
dear
and
wade
and
colman
to
a
situation
in
calcutta
we
can
pursue
our
studies
with
less
interruption
and
also
have
the
advantage
of
wade
assistance
the
war
in
burmah
still
continues
and
there
is
at
present
very
little
prospect
of
our
going
to
rangoon
soon
we
still
look
to
burmah
as
our
earthly
home
and
daily
pray
that
we
may
be
permitted
ere
long
to
enter
that
field
of
labor
we
rejoice
that
we
can
commence
the
study
of
the
language
here
we
have
not
for
an
instant
regretted
that
we
embarked
in
the
undertaking
in
another
letter
of
a
later
date
she
writes
from
calcutta
in
compliance
with
the
advice
of
our
friends
we
are
now
residing
in
a
pleasant
little
house
in
calcutta
i
regretted
exceedingly
to
leave
the
peaceful
retired
shades
of
chitpore
for
the
noise
and
commotion
of
a
city
but
duty
appeared
to
require
it
the
climate
at
chitpore
is
insalubrious
in
the
hot
months
and
we
all
cheerfully
submitted
i
feel
my
dear
friend
that
we
are
wanderers
i
can
look
to
no
place
as
my
earthly
home
but
burmah
we
have
not
yet
heard
from
the
brethren
at
ava
oh
that
our
father
in
heaven
may
prepare
our
hearts
for
whatever
intelligence
we
may
receive
on
monday
last
i
attended
the
examination
of
colman
schools
imagine
my
feelings
at
seeing
little
bengallee
girls
whose
mothers
are
kept
in
the
most
degraded
ignorance
and
superstition
taught
to
read
the
scriptures
this
was
only
one
division
of
the
schools
the
whole
number
belonging
to
this
society
is
nearly
four
hundred
there
are
also
many
other
interesting
schools
in
calcutta
and
wade
with
and
myself
still
compose
our
family
we
are
very
happy
in
each
other
are
blessed
with
excellent
health
enjoy
facilities
for
learning
the
language
and
in
short
possess
all
we
could
desire
we
feel
our
want
of
ardent
piety
pray
for
us
for
we
are
weak
and
sinful
a
letter
to
one
of
her
own
family
of
about
the
same
date
shows
that
her
zeal
for
the
conversion
of
the
heathen
did
not
at
all
weaken
her
desire
that
her
own
kindred
might
be
true
followers
of
jesus
after
mentioning
that
a
burman
teacher
had
been
procured
for
them
she
says
i
often
imagine
myself
in
the
midst
of
that
dear
family
where
the
happy
hours
of
childhood
flew
away
sometimes
i
fancy
myself
entering
the
room
in
the
morning
and
seeing
you
all
kneeling
around
the
family
altar
my
brother
have
you
a
heart
to
pray
to
god
have
you
repented
and
turned
to
him
or
are
you
all
careless
and
indifferent
respecting
your
precious
soul
no
i
can
not
believe
this
is
the
case
indulged
as
you
are
with
hearing
the
gospel
and
other
means
of
grace
you
can
not
be
indifferent
the
time
is
coming
when
the
religion
of
jesus
will
be
indispensable
to
your
peace
of
mind
you
must
pass
through
the
valley
of
death
how
can
you
endure
that
gloom
without
the
light
of
god
countenance
you
must
stand
before
a
righteous
god
at
the
judgment
day
what
will
be
the
state
of
your
soul
if
jesus
is
not
your
friend
of
a
letter
from
wade
written
in
the
spring
following
speaks
with
enthusiasm
of
the
pleasure
they
have
enjoyed
in
the
society
of
and
b
and
like
theirs
breathes
ardent
wishes
to
be
able
to
go
to
burmah
these
wishes
were
soon
to
be
realized
a
letter
from
boardman
dated
calcutta
april
commences
my
dear
brother
the
joyful
news
of
peace
with
ava
and
of
the
safety
of
our
friends
and
judson
and
price
you
will
doubtless
receive
from
other
sources
we
can
only
say
that
the
preservation
of
our
friends
both
at
rangoon
and
at
ava
seems
to
us
one
of
the
most
striking
and
gracious
displays
of
god
special
care
of
his
people
and
his
cause
which
has
been
experienced
in
modern
times
brother
wade
and
myself
with
our
beloved
companions
expect
to
leave
calcutta
in
six
or
eight
weeks
to
join
brother
judson
as
rangoon
is
not
retained
by
the
british
we
do
not
think
it
best
to
recommence
the
work
there
but
rather
to
settle
in
some
of
the
towns
which
are
by
treaty
ceded
to
the
british
the
members
of
the
church
in
rangoon
are
collecting
and
will
probably
go
with
us
we
need
divine

we
have
great
reason
to
be
thankful
for
the
health
we
enjoy
we
long
to
proceed
to
burmah
and
engage
in
the
delightful
work
before
us
may
strength
be
made
perfect
in
our
weakness
but
his
cherished
enterprise
was
still
longer
delayed
by
the
solicitation
of
the
english
missionaries
and
the
appointment
of
the
american
board
he
was
induced
to
remain
in
calcutta
a
while
and
preach
in
circular
road
chapel
recently
vacated
by
the
death
of
lawson
wade
and
his
wife
reached
rangoon
on
the
of
november
and
found
there
the
desolate
and
judson
and
his
feeble
babe
of
whom
wade
was
able
for
a
brief
period
to
supply
the
place
of
a
mother
the
place
fixed
upon
as
the
seat
of
government
in
the
newly
acquired
british
territory
in
burmah
was
amherst
on
the
martaban
river
about
miles
eastward
of
rangoon
this
place
had
been
laid
out
by
british
engineers
under
judson
direction
and
in
an
incredibly
short
time
became
a
city
numbering
in
thousands
of
houses
in
southern
india
houses
are
built
almost
in
a
day
and
the
population
fluctuates
from
place
to
place
with
a
facility
surprising
to
europeans
it
is
only
necessary
to
make
a
clearing
in
the
jungle
and
erect
barracks
for
a
few
soldiers
and
as
water
rushes
at
once
into
hollows
scooped
in
the
damp
so
do
the
natives
of
india
swarm
into
the
clearing
and
create
a
city
to
this
new
city
of
amherst
and
boardman
came
in
the
spring
of
and
joined
and
wade
and
judson
it
was
bitterly
painful
to
them
to
learn
that
the
wife
of
the
latter
that
noble
and
beloved
woman
whose
life
had
been
preserved
as
if
by
miracle
in
a
thousand
dangers
and
from
whose
society
and
intercourse
they
had
hoped
and
expected
the
greatest
pleasure
and
profit
was
the
tenant
of
a
lowly
grave
beneath
the
and
even
more
immediately
distressing
to
find
that
her
husband
was
just
about
to
consign
to
the
same
dreary
bed
the
only
relic
remaining
to
him
of
his
once
lovely
family
sweet
little
maria
one
of
first
labors
in
burmah
was
to
make
a
coffin
for
the
child
with
his
own
hands
and
to
assist
in
its
burial
poor
babe
closed
its
brief
eventful
history
an
innocent
sharer
in
the
terrible
sufferings
of
its
parents
in
the
midst
of
which
indeed
it
came
into
the
world
like
its
mother
it
had
survived
through
countless
threatening
deaths
and
reached
what
seemed
a
haven
of
security
only
to
wring
its
heart
with
an
intenser
pang
by
its
unexpected
and
untimely
death
truly
the
ways
of
god
past
finding
out
and
judgments
are
a
great
deep
from
a
short
poem
full
of
sympathy
and
pious
sentiment
which
was
written
by
boardman
on
this
occasion
we
select
some
passages
ah
this
is
death
my
innocent
is
he
whose
chilling
hand
has
touched
thy
tender
frame
thou
us
not
not
the
bursting
sob
of
thy
dear
father
now
can
pierce
thine
ear
thy
mother
tale
replete
with
varied
scenes
exceeds
my
powers
to
tell
but
other
harps
and
other
voices
sweeter
far
than
mine
shall
sing
her
matchless
worth
her
deeds
of
love
her
zeal
her
toil
her
sufferings
and
her
death
but
all
is
over
now
she
sweetly
sleeps
in
yonder
grave
and
thou
sweet
babe
shalt
soon
be
pillowed
on
her
quiet
breast
yes
ere
sun
shall
gild
the
west
thy
father
shall
have
said
a
long
adieu
to
the
last
lingering
hope
of
earthly
joy
for
thou
maria
wilt
have
found
thy
rest
thy
flesh
shall
rest
in
hope
till
that
great
day
when
he
who
once
endured
far
greater
woes
than
mortal
man
can
know
who
when
on
earth
received
such
little
children
in
his
arms
graciously
blessing
them
shall
come
again
then
like
the
glorious
body
of
thy
lord
who
wakes
thy
dust
this
fragile
frame
shall
be
then
shalt
thou
mount
with
him
on
angels
wings
be
freed
from
sorrow
sickness
sin
and
death
and
in
his
presence
find
eternal
bliss

consultation
it

that

remain
in
amherst

that
and

should
proceed
to
maulmain
a
town
miles
up
the

had
sprung
into
being
in

boardman
makes
this
entry
in
his
journal
after
nearly
two
years
of
wanderings
without
any
certain
we
have
become
inhabitants
of
a
little
spot
of
earth
and
have
entered
a
house
which
we
call
our
earthly
home
none
but
those
who
have
been
in
similar
circumstances
can
conceive
the
satisfaction
we
now
enjoy
the
population
of
the
town
is
supposed
to
be
year
ago
it
was
all
a
thick
jungle
without
an
while
at
amherst
boardman
had
experienced
an
alarming
attack
of
a
disease
incident
to
the
climate
and
had
to
be
carried
to
the
boat
which
conveyed
her
to
her
new
home
on
a
litter
on
her
arrival
there
although
she
shared
her
husband
joy
that
at
length
they
had
a
home
on
the
long
of
burmah
still
her
woman
nature
enfeebled
by
suffering
could
not
but
have
trembled
at
the
idea
of
living
in
a
lonely
spot
for
the
was
nearly
a
mile
from
the
barracks
with
the
neighboring
jungle
swarming
with
serpents
that
hiss
and
beasts
of
prey
that
howl
in
addition
to
this
cause
of
alarm
there
was
opposite
them
on
the
burman
side
of
the
river
the
old
decayed
city
of
martaban
which
was
the
refuge
of
a
horde
of
banditti
who
armed
with
knives
and
swords
would
often
sally
forth
in
bands
of
or
urge
their
light
and
noiseless
boats
across
the
river
satiate
themselves
with
plunder
and
murder
in
the
british
town
and
return
with
their
spoils
to
their
own
territory
where
they
were
secure
from
british
retaliation
the
english
general
knowing
the
insecurity
of
the
had
urged
to
remove
with
his
family
to
the
protection
of
the
fort
but
his
object
was
to
benefit
the
and
to
do
that
he
must
live
among
them
in
their
little
bamboo
hut
therefore
so
frail
that
it
could
be
cut
open
as
boardman
says
with
a
pair
of
scissors
they
prosecuted
their
study
of
the
language
under
a
native
teacher
and
even
ventured
to
talk
a
little
with
the
natives
around
them
and
for
a
few
weeks
were
unmolested
their
courage
and
confidence
had
revived
and
with
restored
health
brought
happiness
june
she
writes
we
are
in
excellent
health
and
as
happy
as
it
is
possible
for
human
beings
to
be
upon
earth
it
is
our
earnest
desire
to
live
labor
and
die
among
this
people
with
such
feelings
they
had
probably
retired
to
rest
on
the
night
of
the
of
june
but
awaking
towards
morning
and
perceiving
that
the
lamp
which
they
always
kept
burning
through
the
night
was
extinguished
they
suspected
mischief
and
on
relighting
it
they
found
to
their
consternation
that
their
house
had
been
entered
by
the
lawless
plunderers
mentioned
above
and
robbed
of
nearly
every
valuable
article
it
contained
but
how
was
their
horror
increased
by
finding
two
large
cuts
in
the
moscheto
curtains
about
their
bed
through
which
the
murderers
had
watched
their
slumbers
ready
to
stab
them
to
the
heart
had
they
offered
the
slightest
resistance
or
even
had
they
waked
to
consciousness
but
he
who
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
had
kindly
steeped
their
senses
in
slumbers
so
profound
and
peaceful
that
not
even
the
infant
stirred
or
opened
its
eyes
which
would
have
instantly
been
sealed
again
in
every
trunk
box
and
bureau
was
rifled
watch
spoons
keys
were
gone
and
yet
as
the
parents
gazed
at
those
rent
curtains
and
thought
how
the
had
grazed
them
with
his
wing
as
he
passed
by
their
hearts
rose
in
gratitude
and
praise
to
their
heavenly
deliverer
but
feelings
are
best
told
in
her
own
expressive
words
she
says
after
the
first
amazement
had
a
little
subsided
i
raised
my
eyes
to
the
curtains
surrounding
our
bed
and
to
my
indescribable
emotion
saw
two
large
holes
cut
the
one
at
the
head
and
the
other
at
the
foot
of
the
place
where
my
dear
husband
had
been
sleeping
from
that
moment
i
quite
forgot
the
stolen
goods
and
thought
only
of
the
treasure
that
was
spared
in
imagination
i
saw
the
assassins
with
their
horrid
weapons
standing
by
our
bedside
ready
to
do
their
worst
had
we
been
permitted
to
wake
oh
how
merciful
was
that
watchful
providence
which
prolonged
those
powerful
slumbers
of
that
night
not
allowing
even
the
infant
at
my
bosom
to
open
its
eyes
at
so
critical
a
moment
if
ever
gratitude
glowed
in
my
bosom
if
ever
the
world
appeared
to
me
worthless
as
vanity
and
if
ever
i
wished
to
dedicate
myself
my
husband
my
babe
my
to
our
great
redeemer
it
was
at
that
time
to
this
day
not
a
trace
of
our
goods
has
been
found
leaving
no
doubt
that
they
were
taken
immediately
over
the
river
to
martaban
since
our
loss
we
have
received
many
kind
presents
from
our
friends
so
that
we
now
find
ourselves
comfortable
and
we
are
contented
and
happy
yes
my
beloved
friend
i
think
i
can
say
that
notwithstanding
our
alarms
never
did
five
months
of
my
life
pass
as
pleasantly
as
the
last
five
have
done
the
thought
of
being
among
this
people
whom
we
have
so
long
desired
to
see
and
the
hope
that
god
would
enable
me
to
do
some
little
good
to
the
poor
heathen
has
rejoiced
and
encouraged
my
heart
i
confess
that
once
or
twice
my
natural
timidity
has
a
gained
ascendancy
over
my
better
feelings
and
at
the
hour
of
midnight
when
the
howlings
of
wild
beasts
have
been
silenced
by
the
report
of
a
musket
near
us
we
would
say
to
each
other
perhaps
the
next
attack
will
be
made
upon
and
the
next
charge
may
be
aimed
at
our
bosoms
then
i
have
been
almost
ready
to
exclaim
oh
for
one
little
room
of
such
materials
that
we
could
as
far
as
human
means
go
sleep
in
safety
but
these
fears
have
been
transitory
and
we
have
generally
been
enabled
to
place
our
confidence
in
the
great
shepherd
of
israel
who
never
slumbers
or
sleeps
assured
that
he
would
protect
us
and
we
have
also
felt
a
sweet
composure
in
the
reflection
that
god
has
marked
out
our
way
and
if
it
best
accord
with
his
designs
that
we
fall
a
prey
to
these
monsters
will
be
the
english
hearing
of
this
robbery
stationed
a
guard
at
the
of
two
sepoys
or
native
soldiers
as
one
of
these
was
sitting
in
the
verandah
a
wild
beast
from
the
jungle
sprang
furiously
upon
him
but
he
was
frightened
away
before
the
man
was
much
injured
such
occurrences
however
were
rare
and
did
not
make
boardman
desire
all
things
considered
to
change
her
residence
she
was
in
the
place
of
her
choice
the
country
of
her
adoption
she
had
a
faithful
and
loving
husband
and
a
lovely
and
almost
idolized
babe
their
house
though
small
and
insecure
was
beautifully
situated
with
everything
in
the
natural
landscape
around
to
charm
her
cultivated
eye
and
taste
these
were
her
comforts
besides
even
the
insecurity
of
their
habitation
was
daily
diminishing
for
houses
were
constantly
springing
up
around
them
and
more
and
more
of
the
jungle
was
cleared
and
cultivated
but
what
gave
its
chief
zest
to
her
life
and
that
of
her
spiritually
minded
husband
was
the
fact
that
they
found
here
a
field
of
in
the
only
work
that
seemed
to
them
worth
living
for
from
various
motives
the
natives
began
to
visit
them
constantly
and
in
increasing
numbers
to
inquire
concerning
the
new
religion
held
a
religious
service
on
the
sabbath
and
opened
a
school
for
boys
boardman
one
for
girls
and
both
conversed
as
well
as
they
were
able
with
their
numerous
visitors
and
employed
all
their
leisure
in
mastering
the
language
on
the
of
july
they
commemorated
together
the
saviour
dying
love
in
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
a
solitary
pair
yet
not
so
for
the
master
of
the
feast
was
there
to
bless
the
two
who
thus
gathered
together
in
his
name
the
population
at
maulmain
was
now
increasing
and
that
at
amherst
diminishing
so
rapidly
that
judson
and
and
wade
thought
best
to
remove
from
the
latter
station
to
the
former
and
arrived
at
maulmain
in
october
two
houses
of
public
worship
were
erected
during
the
year
where
judson
and
wade
were
daily
employed
in
proclaiming
religious
truth
and
such
was
their
success
that
within
a
few
months
they
admitted
to
the
church
several
native
members
as
many
native
converts
with
their
families
had
removed
with
the
missionaries
from
amherst
to
maulmain
wade
and
boardman
united
their
schools
into
one
which
was
attended
with
the
most
gratifying
success
moung
and
moung
ing
who
have
often
been
mentioned
in
the
former
memoir
read
the
scriptures
and
other
religious
books
to
all
who
would
hear
at
a
sort
of
built
for
the
purpose
in
march
our
friends
were
delivered
from
a
danger
not
unknown
in
our
own
country
one
evening
they
were
startled
by
a
roaring
like
that
of
flame
and
on
going
to
the
door
discovered
the
whole
jungle
to
the
eastward
of
them
enveloped
in
sheets
of
flame
which
was
rapidly
approaching
their
frail
cottage
seeing
no
hope
that
their
house
could
escape
they
rapidly
collected
a
few
valuables
and
with
their
infant
prepared
to
flee
towards
the
river
though
in
much
terror
lest
their
path
should
be
beset
by
leopards
tigers
and
other
animals
driven
from
their
haunts
by
the
fire
but
when
within
a
few
feet
of
the
houses
the
flames
were
arrested
by
a
sudden
change
of
the
wind
and
the
dwellings
were
unhurt
thus
again
are
we
preserved
says
b
when
no
human
arm
could
have
saved
us
truly
the
hosts
of
god
encamp
around
the
dwellings
of
the
just
truly
the
lord
knoweth
how
to
deliver
the
godly
chapter
vi
removal
to

of
the
letter
from

baptism
of
a
karen
some
account
of
the
karens
the
permanent
collection
of
so
many
missionaries
at
a
single
station
was
not
approved
by
the
board
nor
was
it
deemed
desirable
by
the
missionaries
themselves
in
accordance
therefore
with
instructions
received
from
america
it
was
decided
that
and
boardman
should
remove
to
tavoy
this
city
is
situated
on
the
river
tavoy
miles
south
of
maulmain
and
had
at
that
time
a
population
of
burmans
and
foreigners
the
city
was
the
stronghold
of
the
religion
of
gaudama
and
the
residence
of
two
hundred
priests
on
every
eligible
point
stood
an
emblem
or
image
of
idolatry
tall
pagodas
crowned
every
eminence
and
humbler
ones
clustered
around
them
while
thickly
set
groves
of
banyan
and
other
sacred
trees
sheltered
shrines
and
images
of
gaudama
and
on
festival
days
were
crowded
with
devotees
kneeling
in
the
gloomy
pathways
or
festooning
the
sacred
trees
with
the
rarest
flowers
the
tops
of
some
of
the
thousand
pagodas
in
the
city
are
hung
with
innumerable
little
bells
which
moved
by
the
wind
chime
sweetly
their
calls
to
devotion
reminding
one
of
a
passage
in
moore
description
of
an
eastern
city
but
hark
the
vesper
call
to
prayer
as
slow
the
orb
of
daylight
sets
is
rising
sweetly
on
the
air
from
syria
thousand
minarets
this
change
in
their
place
of
abode
could
not
fail
to
be
a
severe
trial
to
our
missionaries
to
maulmain
they
were
bound
by
many
ties
the
sweet
companionship
of
and
the
love
which
attaches
the
missionary
to
those
spiritual
children
which
the
lord
has
given
him
moreover
it
was
their
first
sanctified
by
signal
deliverances
and
countless
mercies
nevertheless
like
abraham
who
at
the
call
of
jehovah
went
out
not
knowing
whither
he
went
these
followers
of
them
who
through
faith
inherit
the
promises
obeyed
the
voice
of
duty
and
feeling
themselves
strangers
and
pilgrims
on
the
earth
went
without
murmuring
to
their
new
sphere
of
labor
one
thing
is
certain
says
in
a
subsequent
letter
we
were
brought
here
by
the
guidance
of
providence
it
was
no
favorite
scheme
of
ours
on
arriving
at
tavoy
they
were
kindly
received
by
burney
the
english
resident
and
within
ten
days
from
their
arrival
had
procured
a
house
and
begun
to
teach
inquirers
in
the
way
of
salvation
much
as
there
was
to
discourage
them
in
this
of
the
missionary
looked
out
on
the
strange
magnificence
of
shrines
and
temples
that
lay
around
him
upon
the
monuments
that
had
perpetuated
for
many
ages
this
idolatrous
worship
upon
the
priests
who
taught
it
and
the
countless
devotees
who
practised
it
and
as
he
prepared
to
strike
the
first
blow
at
the
hoary
superstition
which
they
all
enshrined
he
felt
to
the
full
the
sublimity
and
greatness
of
the
undertaking
he
stood
alone
the
herald
of
truth
before
this
mighty
array
of
ancient
error
but
he
trusted
implicitly
in
the
promises
of
revelation
and
felt
assured
that
the
day
was
at
hand
when
all
this
empty
adoration
of
gaudama
would
give
place
to
the
worship
of
the
living
god
a
new
difficulty
occurred
here
which
however
was
speedily
surmounted
by
the
diligence
and
zeal
of
the
missionaries
the
dialect
of
tavoy
was
so
different
from
pure
burmese
as
to
be
almost
unintelligible
to
those
who
knew
only
the
latter
but
both
fortunately
employed
the
same
written
characters
boardman
employments
at
this
time
are
enumerated
in
their
letters
after
unwearied
toil
and
repeated
repulses
and
discouragements
she
succeeded
in
establishing
a
girls
school
in
which
she
employed
a
woman
who
could
read
as
an
assistant
she
describes
a
visit
to
her
school
thus
i
am
just
returned
from
one
of
the
the
sun
had
not
risen
when
i
arrived
but
the
little
girls
were
in
the
house
ready
for
instruction
my
walk
to
this
school
is
through
a
retired
road
shaded
on
one
side
by
the
old
wall
of
the
city
which
is
overgrown
with
wild
creepers
and
and
on
the
other
by
large
while
going
and
returning
i
find
it
sweet
and
profitable
to
think
on
the
shortness
of
time
the
vanity
of
this
delusive
world
and
oh
i
have
had
some
precious
views
of
that
world
where
the
weary
are
at
rest
and
where
sin
that
enemy
of
god
and
now
constant
disturber
of
my
peace
will
no
more
afflict
me
in
another
letter
of
a
later
date
she
describes
herself
as
sitting
at
her
table
in
a
back
porch
from
which
she
can
see
her
dear
husband
in
a
room
before
her
teaching
nine
little
heathen
boys
while
in
one
of
the
long
verandahs
on
each
side
of
the
house
the
native
christians
are
holding
a
in
their
own
language
and
in
the
other
a
chinese
convert
is
urging
three
or
four
of
his
deluded
countrymen
to
turn
from
their
stupid
superstitions
to
the
service
of
jehovah
she
mentions
also
the
baptism
of
a
the
name
of
a
tribe
in
burmah
a
who
had
been
converted
while
in
the
service
of
judson
little
knowing
the
importance
of
the
fact
thus
recorded
this
poor
man
in
fact
formerly
a
slave
and
whom
the
writer
of
an
article
in
a
former
number
of
the
would
have
sneered
at
as
he
did
at
the
fisherman
the
trophy
of
divine
mentioned
in
judson
history
of
the
mission
was
the
famous
whose
life
has
been
written
by
mason
and
who
by
his
zeal
and
success
in
missionary
labor
obtained
the
name
of
the
karen
apostle
he
was
the
first
to
introduce
to
the
notice
of
the
missionaries
the
tribe
to
which
he
belonged
a
people
so
remarkable
that
we
are
unwilling
even
in
our
brief
sketch
to
pass
them
over
without
notice
the
karens
according
to
a
writer
in
the
american
are
a
savage
and
ignorant
race
of
men
their
in
the
burman
language
signifying
scattered
in
vast
numbers
over
the
wilds
of
farther
india
and
inhabiting
almost
inaccessible
tracts
among
the
mountains
and
forests
their
peculiar
physiognomy
strange
traditions
and
some
of
their
customs
have
led
to
the
opinion
that
they
were
of
hebrew
origin
though
some
think
they
are
of
the
caucasian
variety
of
the
human
species
they
differ
much
from
the
burmans
by
whom
they
are
heavily
taxed
and
grievously
oppressed
and
in
every
way
treated
as
inferiors
their
traditions
have
been
preserved
like
the
poems
of
ossian
by
fond
memories
delighting
to
revive
the
recollections
of
former
glory
and
prosperity
repeated
by
grandsires
at
to
their
listening
descendants
and
sung
by
mourners
over
the
graves
of
their
elders
they
believe
in
a
god
who
is
denominated
a
name
certainly
similar
to
the
hebrew
jehovah
some
of
their
traditional
songs
are
curious
and
interesting
for
instance
god
created
us
in
ancient
time
and
has
a
perfect
knowledge
of
all
things
when
men
call
his
name
and
again
the
sons
of
heaven
are
holy
they
sit
by
the
seat
of
god
the
sons
of
heaven
are
righteous
they
dwell
together
with
god
they
lean
against
his
silver
seat
the
following
stanza
says
the
writer
above
referred
to
might
be
mistaken
for
the
production
of
david
or
isaiah
satan
in
days
of
old
was
holy
but
he
transgressed
god
law
satan
of
old
was
righteous
but
he
departed
from
the
law
of
god
and
god
drove
him
away
they
say
that
god
formerly
loved
their
nation
but
on
account
of
their
wickedness
he
punished
it
and
made
them
the
degraded
creatures
they
now
are
but
they
say
god
will
again
have
mercy
upon
us
god
will
save
us
again
one
verse
of
one
of
their
songs
is
when
the
karen
king
arrives
everything
will
be
happy
when
karens
have
a
king
wild
beasts
will
lose
their
savageness
professor
gammell
says
in
substance
that
they
present
the
extraordinary
phenomenon
of
a
people
without
any
form
of
religion
or
established
priesthood
yet
believing
in
god
and
in
future
retribution
and
cherishing
and
transmitting
from
age
to
age
a
set
of
traditions
of
unusual
purity
and
containing
bright
predictions
of
future
prosperity
and
glory
when
the
poor
convert
already
mentioned
was
baptized
he
naturally
carried
to
his
countrymen
the
thrilling
news
that
a
teacher
from
a
far
distant
land
had
come
to
preach
a
new
religion
a
religion
answering
to
the
religion
of
their
fathers
others
came
to
listen
and
to
carry
back
to
their
secluded
hamlets
the
joyful
tidings
until
from
distant
hills
and
remote
valleys
and
forests
karen
inquirers
flocked
to
tavoy
and
thronged
around
listening
to
the
new
doctrines
with
childlike
simplicity
and
uncommon
sensibility
among
other
singular
stories
that
they
related
to
the
wondering
teacher
one
was
that
more
than
ten
years
before
a
book
in
a
strange
tongue
had
been
left
among
them
by
a
foreigner
who
commanded
them
to
worship
it
which
command
they
had
faithfully
obeyed
boardman
felt
the
strongest
curiosity
to
see
this
but
owing
to
the
prevalence
of
the
rains
he
was
not
gratified
till
the
following
september
he
was
then
waited
on
by
a
large
deputation
of
karens
bringing
with
them
in
a
covered
basket
the
mysterious
volume
wrapped
in
fold
after
fold
of
muslin
on
removing
which
it
proved
to
be
an
oxford
edition
of
the
common
prayer
book
in
the
english
language
with
the
greatest
simplicity
they
asked
if
this
book
contained
the
doctrines
of
the
new
religion
and
if
so
requested
to
be
taught
its
contents
assured
them
that
the
book
was
good
but
should
by
no
means
be
made
an
object
of
worship
and
accepting
it
from
them
he
gave
them
in
its
stead
portions
of
the
scriptures
translated
into
a
language
they
could
understand
they
entreated
him
to
visit
them
in
their
own
villages
assuring
him
of
the
readiness
of
their
tribe
to
welcome
him
and
to
receive
the
gospel
and
struck
with
their
earnestness
and
candor
he
promised
at
some
future
time
to
yield
to
their
request
the
sorcerer
who
had
preserved
the
book
and
prescribed
to
the
simple
heathen
the
forms
of
its
worship
threw
away
his
cudgel
or
wand
of
office
and
laid
aside
his
fantastic
dress
and
boardman
sent
the
mysterious
volume
to
america
to
be
deposited
in
the
museum
of
the
baptist
missionary
society
who
the
foreigner
may
have
been
that
thus
supplied
an
ignorant
people
with
a
divinity
or
object
of
worship
or
what
were
his
motives
in
so
doing
will
probably
always
remain
a
mystery
if
we
have
devoted
considerable
space
to
this
notice
of
the
karens
their
subsequent
history
will
prove
that
they
are
not
unworthy
of
such
notice

on
and
b
extract
of
a
letter
from
boardman
to
a
beloved
sister
dated
tavoy
nothing
especial
has
occurred
since
i
last
wrote
we
are
still
in
good
health
and
happy
in
our
work
we
are
now
destitute
of
all
religious
society
and
feel
that
our
responsibilities
are
great
indeed
we
have
to
suffer
many
little
inconveniences
in
this
country
but
have
no
disposition
to
complain
we
rejoice
in
the
kind
providence
that
has
directed
our
steps
and
would
not
exchange
our
condition
our
desire
is
to
labor
among
the
poor
heathen
until
called
to
our
eternal
home
she
then
with
characteristic
earnestness
and
affection
inquires
after
her
sister
spiritual
state
oh
if
you
are
a
child
of
god
how
great
is
your
happiness
you
can
think
of
death
without
fear
the
troubles
and
griefs
of
life
do
not
distress
you
as
they
do
the
poor
worldling
who
looks
only
to
the
enjoyments
of
this
life
for
comfort
if
a
christian
you
have
sweet
foretastes
of
that
joy
which
is
unspeakable
and
inconceivable
by
mortals
though
a
sinner
still
you
feel
that
your
sins
are
pardoned
and
that
through
the
merits
of
a
crucified
saviour
you
will
at
last
be
accepted
of
god
i
would
fondly
hope
my
dear
sister
that
this
is
your
happy
case
but
if
not
oh
who
can
tell
your
dreadful
danger
who
can
paint
the
alarming
prospect
before
you
every
moment
exposed
to
death
and
yet
without
hope
subject
to
disappointments
and
afflictions
in
this
world
and
yet
no
refuge
for
your
anguished
spirit
the
weight
of
sins
daily
accumulating
and
every
day
less
prospect
of
obtaining
pardon
the
awful
prospect
of
eternal
banishment
from
all
that
is
holy
oh
my
sister
reflect
if
you
have
not
yet
turned
to
the
saviour
delay
no
longer
oh
may
you
and
all
my
beloved
brothers
and
sisters
be
early
brought
to
a
knowledge
of
the
truth
i
can
not
express
the
anxiety
i
feel
for
every
one
of
you
i
also
feel
the
solicitude
of
a
tender
sister
for
your
temporal
good
write
me
particulars
of
the
health
of
my
dear
parents
and
each
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
though
separated
from
you
i
always
wish
to
share
your
joys
and
sorrows
your
little
niece
is
in
charming
health
she
sends
many
kisses
to
you
all
and
i
shall
teach
her
to
love
you
though
she
can
not
see
you
we
have
inserted
this
letter
which
in
its
spirit
is
a
specimen
of
all
her
letters
not
only
for
its
intrinsic
excellence
but
to
show
that
even
in
distant
burmah
and
surrounded
by
cares
and
duties
which
would
have
diminished
in
a
less
affectionate
breast
her
interest
in
her
distant
relatives
her
heart
untravelled
fondly
turned
to
them
and
dragged
at
each
remove
a
lengthening
chain
while
laboring
for
the
conversion
of
pagans
she
felt
more
than
she
had
ever
felt
before
the
awful
danger
of
those
who
under
the
full
blaze
of
gospel
light
choose
to
walk
in
darkness
and
for
her
family
her
dear
brothers
and
sisters
her
burden
was
almost
like
that
of
the
apostle
who
was
as
it
were
willing
to
give
up
his
own
title
to
the
heavenly
inheritance
if
by
so
doing
he
could
save
his
kindred
according
to
the
flesh
all
her
letters
which
we
have
been
privileged
to
see
bear
evidence
of
this
in
december
of
the
year
boardman
was
called
to
a
trial
which
of
all
others
was
most
fitted
to
make
her
feel
that
every
earthly
dependence
is
at
best
but
a
broken
reed
and
that
the
spider
most
attenuated
thread
is
cord
is
cable
to
our
strongest
hold
on
earthly
bliss
it
breaks
with
every
breeze
her
almost
idolized
husband
her
guide
her
only
human
support
protector
and
companion
was
attacked
by
that
insidious
and
incurable
malady
which
was
destined
at
no
distant
day
to
close
his
career
of
usefulness
on
earth
and
send
him
early
to
his
reward
a
copious
hemorrhage
from
the
lungs
warned
him
that
his
time
for
earthly
labor
was
short
and
seemed
to
increase
his
desire
to
work
while
his
day
lasted
as
soon
as
his
strength
was
sufficiently
restored
after
his
first
attack
namely
in
february
he
resolved
to
fulfil
his
intention
to
visit
the
karens
in
their
native
villages
he
took
with
him
two
karens
two
of
his
scholars
and
a
servant
females
who
in
this
country
of
order
and
security
tremble
at
the
idea
of
being
left
for
one
night
alone
in
their
strong
and
guarded
dwellings
may
perhaps
conceive
the
feelings
of
boardman
on
being
thus
left
by
her
her
own
health
scarce
after
a
four
months
illness
her
mind
agitated
by
fears
for
her
stricken
husband
who
under
burning
suns
and
amid
unknown
wilds
exposed
to
the
fury
of
the
sudden
and
the
wild
beast
of
the
jungles
must
be
absent
from
her
perhaps
two
or
three
dreary
weeks
in
which
time
not
one
cordial
endearing
report
from
him
would
reach
her
in
her
frail
hut
and
with
two
little
ones
dearer
to
her
than
life
exposed
to
the
same
dangers
as
herself
what
could
support
her
in
such
circumstances
but
her
faith
in
that
arm
whose
strength
is
shown
to
be
perfect
in
weakness
a
poor
karen
woman
seeing
her
distress
tried
to
console
her
weep
not
mama
she
said
the
teacher
has
gone
on
an
errand
of
compassion
to
my
poor
perishing
countrymen
they
have
never
heard
of
the
true
god
and
the
love
of
his
son
jesus
christ
who
died
upon
he
cross
to
save
sinners
they
know
nothing
of
the
true
religion
mama
and
when
they
die
they
can
not
go
to
the
golden
country
of
the
blessed
god
will
take
care
of
the
teacher
do
not
weep
mama
blessed
faith
in
an
omnipresent
heavenly
father
it
gives
even
the
unlettered
karen
disciple
an
eloquence
in
consolation
to
which
worldly
philosophy
is
a
stranger
boardman
journey
though
perilous
from
the
causes
above
mentioned
and
tedious
from
being
performed
on
foot
was
highly
interesting
on
account
of
the
eager
welcome
and
abundant
hospitality
of
the
karen
villagers
whom
he
visited
on
entering
a
village
he
and
his
little
caravan
were
overwhelmed
with
presents
of
provisions
and
fruits
and
the
inhabitants
would
exclaim
while
their
countenances
beamed
with
delight
ah
you
have
come
we
have
long
wanted
to
see
you
he
travelled
more
than
one
hundred
miles
often
through
unfrequented
and
toilsome
paths
among
the
mountains
and
was
three
times
drenched
with
powerful
rains
from
which
he
had
no
sufficient
shelter
but
by
the
aid
of
an
interpreter
he
preached
seventeen
sermons
and
was
cheered
by
finding
the
readiness
of
the
people
to
receive
his
doctrines
far
exceed
his
most
sanguine
expectations
on
his
return
both
he
and
boardman
had
to
experience
an
affliction
extremely
trying
to
the
heart
of
a
missionary
the
defection
of
some
of
the
christian
converts
their
sensitive
spirits
led
and
to
fear
that
their
own
unfaithfulness
might
have
been
the
cause
of
the
fall

her
humiliation
deep
and
sincere
our
hearts
she
says
have
bled
with
anguish
and
mine
has
sunk
lower
than
the
grave
for
i
have
felt
that
my
unworthiness
has
been
the
cause
of
all
our
calamities

keen
were

at

in

her

in

of

she
writes
some
of
these
poor
burmans
who
are
daily
carried
to
the
grave
may
at
last
reproach
me
and
say
you
came
it
is
true
to
the
city
where
we
dwelt
to
tell
of
heaven
and
hell
but
wasted
much
much
of
your
precious
time
in
indolence
while
learning
our
language
and
when
you
were
able
to
speak
why
were
you
not
incessantly
telling
us
of
this
day
of
doom
when
we
visited
you
why
oh
why
did
you
ever
speak
of
any
other
thing
while
we
were
ignorant
of
this
most
momentous
of
all
truths
how
could
you
think
on
anything
but
our
salvation
you
told
us
you
knew
of
a
being
that
heard
your
lowest
whispers
and
most
secret
sighs
why
then
did
you
not
day
and
night
entreat
him
in
our
behalf
boardman
in
his
journal
says
my
dear
wife
became
at
this
time
so
deeply
impressed
with
divine
things
and
particularly
with
a
sense
of
her
own
sinfulness
that
she
had
no
rest
night
or
day
we
both
endeavored
to
return
to
the
lord
from
whom
we
had
strayed
but
our
path
especially
that
of
led
hard
by
the
borders
of
despair
we
confessed
our
sins
to
the
lord
and
to
one
another
we
considered
ourselves
worthy
to
be
trodden
under
foot
of
men
and
were
astonished
to
think
of
our
pride
and
selfishness
we
were
filled
with
the
most
distressing
views
of
our
utter
sinfulness
in
the
sight
of
a
holy
god
thus
was
this
affliction
though
grievous
beginning
to
work
out
in
her
heart
its
peaceable
fruit
of
righteousness
by
deepening
her
humility
quickening
her
zeal
and
leading
her
to
a
more
thorough
consecration
of
herself
to
the
work
she
had
undertaken

having

shattered

lovely

came

sometime
afterward
she

my
ever
dear
sister
i
think
i
have
not
written
you
since
the
death
of
our
beloved
sarah
which
is
nearly
eight
months
ago
i
have
never
delayed
writing
to
you
so
long
before
for
some
time
after
her
death
little
george
was
apparently
near
the
grave
and
i
was
confined
to
my
bed
for
a
number
of
weeks
as
soon
as
my
health
was
a
little
improved
the
rebellion
at
tavoy
took
place
which
threw
us
all
into
confusion
and
this
lasted
until
i
was
taken
ill
again
about
three
months
since
from
this
illness
i
am
but
just
recovering
so
you
see
my
beloved
sister
my
outward
circumstances
have
been
sufficient
to
prevent
my
writing
nor
is
this
all
for
some
time
after
little
sarah
departure
i
was
too
much
distressed
to
write
i
felt
assured
that
god
had
taken
her
away
from
us
in
love
and
was
also
assured
that
she
is
a
happy
angel
in
heaven
but
oh
the
thought
that
we
should
see
her
no
more
on
earth
filled
me
with
by
degrees
my
mind
became
calmer
not
that
i
forgot
her
but
i
feel
my
dear
harriet
that
the
dearest
and
sweetest
pleasures
of
this
life
are
empty
and
altogether
unsatisfying
i
do
not
look
for
comfort
from
these
sources
as
i
formerly
did
we
have
a
fine
healthy
boy
but
i
do
not
allow
myself
to
idolize
him
as
i
did
his
dear
departed
sister
in
her
dissolution
we
saw
such
a
wreck
of
what
was
most
lovely
and
beautiful
that
it
seems
as
if
we
should
be
kept
in
future
from
the
creature
particulars
respecting
the
child
illness
and
death
are
given
in
another
letter
of
nearly
the
same
date
our
little
sarah
left
us
july
of
last
year
aged
years
and
months
she
was
a
singularly
lovely
child
her
bright
blue
eyes
yellow
hair
and
rosy
cheeks
formed
a
striking
contrast
to
the
dark
little
faces
around
her
from
the
time
she
began
to
notice
anything
we
were
the
objects
of
her
fondest
love
if
she
thought
she
had
incurred
our
displeasure
her
tender
heart
seemed
ready
to
burst
and
she
could
not
rest
for
a
moment
until
she
had
said
she
was
and
obtained
the
kiss
of
forgiveness
she
had
learned
to
obey
us
implicitly
if
either
of
us
were
ill
she
would
stroke
our
foreheads
with
her
little
soft
hand
and
kiss
us
affectionately
her
love
to
her
little
brother
george
was
unlimited
from
the
day
of
his
birth
till
the
day
but
one
before
she
died
he
was
her
idol
three
days
before
she
died
she
was
lying
uneasily
in
a
large
swing
cradle
and
george
was
in
the
same
room
crying
we
thought
it
might
soothe
the
little
sufferer
for
he
also
was
very
ill
to
lay
him
down
beside
sarah
the
proposal
delighted
her
with
smiles
she
threw
open
her
little
arms
and
for
the
last
time
held
her
darling
brother
in
her
fond
embrace
so
great
was
her
gratification
at
this
privilege
that
she
seemed
to
forget
her
own
pains
little
sarah
spoke
english
remarkably
well
for
so
young
a
child
and
burmese
like
a
native
she
could
also
say
some
things
in
the
hindostanee
and
karen
and
what
seems
a
little
singular
she
never
confounded
two
languages
but
always
spoke
pure
english
to
us
and
pure
burmese
to
burmans
this
discrimination
continued
as
long
as
she
had
the
powers
of
speech
she
had
learned
the
lord
prayer
and
several
little
hymns
judson
lines
on
the
death
of
mee
shawayee
she
knew
by
heart
in
burmese
and
used
to
chant
them
for
half
an
hour
at
a
time
these
things
may
seem
very
trivial
to
you
but
i
muse
upon
them
by
the
hour
together
and
it
is
only
when
i
call
my
cooler
judgment
into
action
that
i
can
make
myself
believe
they
are
uninteresting
to
any
person
on
earth
i
love
to
think
of
my
sweet
bud
of
immortality
expanding
so
beautifully
in
my
own
presence
and
fancy
i
can
judge
in
some
small
degree
of
the
brilliancy
of
the
perfect
flower
from
these
little
developments
a
few
hours
before
she
died
she
called
us
to
her
kissed
us
and
passed
her
dear
hand
still
full
and
dimpled
as
in
health
softly
over
our
faces
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
were
so
dilated
that
she
could
not
see
us
distinctly
and
once
for
a
moment
or
two
her
mind
seemed
to
be
wandering
then
looking
anxiously
into
my
face
she
said
frightened
mamma
i
frightened
oh
with
what
feelings
did
i
wash
and
dress
her
lovely
form
for
the
last
time
and
compose
her
perfect
little
limbs
and
then
see
her
the
dear
child
that
had
so
long
lain
in
my
bosom
borne
away
to
her
grave
my
heart
grew
faint
when
i
thought
that
i
had
performed
for
her
my
last
office
of
love
that
she
would
never
need
a
mother
hand
again
my
dear
husband
performed
the
funeral
service
with
an
aching
though
not
desponding
heart
the
grave
is
in
our
own
enclosure
about
fifteen
rods
from
the
house
a
beautiful
retired
spot
in
a
grove
of
near
it
is
a
little
bethel
erected
for
private
devotion
thither
we
have
often
repaired
and
we
trust
that
god
who
in
his
infinite
wisdom
had
taken
our
treasure
to
himself
often
meets
us
there
the
biographer
of
boardman
since
her
successor
in
the
mission
mentions
that
a
single
speculative
error
had
crept
into
her
religious
faith
on
the
subject
of
god
particular
providence
that
while
contemplating
the
vastness
of
that
agency
that
ever
busy
wheels
the
silent
spheres
she
had
almost
thought
it
derogatory
to
the
majesty
of
heaven
and
earth
to
conceive
of
him
as
occupied
with
our
mean
affairs
numbering
the
hairs
of
our
heads
and
guiding
the
sparrow
fall
but
the
blow
which
crushed
her
heart
destroyed
its
skepticism
she
saw
so
clearly
in
this
dispensation
the
hand
of
a
father
chastening
his
erring
child
she
felt
so
keenly
that
she
deserved
the
rod
for
having
in
a
measure
worshipped
the
gift
more
than
the
giver
that
she
with
all
the
strength
of
an
irresistible
conviction
that
even
so
lowly
a
thing
as
her
own
heart
was
indeed
a
theatre
for
the
constant
display
of
her
maker
guiding
and
controlling
power
not
less
than
the
starry
heavens
that
her
own
sanctification
and
the
providential
means
to
effect
it
even
in
their
minutest
details
were
ordered
by
sovereign
grace
and
wisdom
and
from
this
time
forth
she
never
doubted
again
but
it
is
time
to
detail
the
scenes
that
occurred
a
few
months
after
the
death
of
the
child
to
which
scenes
allusion
was
made
in

the
revolt
of
tavoy
from
the
british
government
and
its
consequences
to
the
missionaries
and
other
foreigners
in
the
city
are
so
well
described
in

a
friend
in

that

will
give
it

and
dear
sir
the
province
of
tavoy
has
engaged
in
an
open
revolt
against
the
british
government
on
lord
day
morning
the
inst
at
we
were
aroused
from
our
quiet
slumbers
by
the
cry
of
master
tavoy
rebels
and
ringing
at
all
our
doors
and
windows
we
were
soon
awake
to
our
extreme
danger
as
we
heard
not
only
a
continual
report
of
musketry
within
the
town
but
the
balls
were
frequently
passing
over
our
heads
and
our
and
in
a
few
moments
a
large
company
of
tavoyans
collected
near
our
gate
and
gave
us
reason
to
suspect
they
were
consulting
what
to
do
with
us
we
lifted
our
hearts
to
god
for
protection
and
boardman
and
little
george
were
hurried
away
through
a
back
door
to
a
retired
building
in
the
rear
i
lay
down
in
the
house
to
escape
the
bullets
with
a
single
burman
boy
to
watch
and
communicate
the
first
intelligence
after
an
hour
of
the
greatest
anxiety
and
uncertainty
i
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
the
sepoys
troops
in
the
british
service
in
possession
of
the
city
gates
in
front
of
our
house
we
soon
ascertained
that
a
party
of
about
men
had
in
the
first
instance
attacked
the
powder
magazine
and
which
were
very
near
our
house
but
a
guard
of
sepoys
had
repelled
them
this
was
a
great
mercy
for
had
the
insurgents
obtained
the
arms
and
ammunition
our
situation
would
have
been
most
deplorable
a
second
party
of
had
attacked
the
house
of
the
principal
native
officer
of
the
town
while
a
third
party
had
fallen
upon
the
guard
of
the
prison
and
let
loose
all
the
prisoners
one
hundred
in
number
who
as
soon
as
their
irons
were
knocked
off
became
the
most
desperate
of
all
the
insurgents
the
commissioner
of
the
province
was
absent
at
maulmain
but
his
lady
burney
urged
their
immediate
removal
to
the
government
house
they
hesitated
at
first
thinking
the
rebellion
might
soon
be
quelled
but
hearing
from
a
rebel
prisoner
that
the
whole
province
was
engaged
in
the
insurrection
and
that
large
reinforcements
might
be
hourly
expected
to
join
the
rebels
and
finding
that
the
mission
premises
from
their
situation
were
likely
to
be
the
very
battleground
of
the
contending
parties
after
seeking
divine
direction
they
concluded
to
abandon
them
he
continues
his
narrative
we
caught
up
a
few
light
articles
on
which
we
could
lay
our
hands
and
with
the
native
christians
fled
as
if
for
our
lives
i
visited
the
house
once
or
twice
after
this
and
saved
a
few
clothes
and
papers
but
the
firing
being
near
rendered
it
hazardous
to
remain
and
the
last
time
i
went
i
found
the
house
had
been
plundered
a
large
part
of
our
books
furniture
and
clothes
which
had
remained
behind
were
either
taken
away
or
destroyed
we
had
been
at
the
government
house
but
a
short
time
when
it
was
agreed
to
evacuate
the
town
and
retire
to
the
wharf
in
the
hurry
of
our
second
removal
many
things
which
we
had
brought
from
our
house
were
necessarily
left
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
plunderers
we
soon
found
ourselves
at
the
wharf
a
large
wooden
building
of
six
rooms
into
which
besides
the
europeans
were
huddled
all
the
sepoys
with
their
baggage
and
ours
and
several
hundreds
of
women
and
children
belonging
to
portuguese
and
others
who
looked
to
the
english
for
protection
our
greatest
danger
at
this
time
arose
from
having
in
one
of
the
rooms
where
many
were
to
sleep
and
all
of
us
were
continually
passing
several
hundred
barrels
of
gunpowder
to
which
if
fire
should
be
communicated
accidentally
by
ourselves
or
mischievously
by
others
we
should
all
perish
at
once
the
next
danger
was
from
the
rebels
who
if
they
could
either
rush
upon
us
or
take
us
by
surprise
or
stratagem
would
doubtless
massacre
us
all
on
the
spot
we
lifted
up
our
hearts
to
god
and
he
heard
us
from
his
holy
habitation
we
were
preserved
in
safety
through
the
night
though
anxious
and
sleepless
all
our
attempts
to
communicate
intelligence
of
our
situation
to
the
people
in
maulmain
and
mergui
were
defeated
and
the
heavy
rains
soon
affected
the
health
of
the
sepoys
we
had
but
a
small
supply
of
rice
in
the
granary
near
the
wharf
and
that
was
continually
in
danger
of
being
destroyed
or
burnt
but
through
the
kind
care
of
our
heavenly
father
we
were
preserved
alive
and
nothing
of
great
importance
occurred
until
the
morning
of
thursday
a
little
before
when
a
party
of
advanced
upon
us
from
the
town
and
set
fire
to
several
houses
and
vessels
near
the
wharf
but
god
interposed
in
our
behalf
and
sent
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
which
extinguished
the
fire
while
the
sepoys
repelled
the
assailants
at
breakfast
the
same
morning
we
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
the
diana
coming
up
the
river
with
major
burney
on
board
our
hearts
bounded
with
gratitude
to
god
it
was
soon
agreed
that
the
diana
should
return
immediately
to
maulmain
for
a
reinforcement
of
troops
and
major
burney
had
the
kindness
to
offer
a
passage
for
boardman
and
our
family
together
with
his
own
after
looking
to
god
for
direction
i
concluded
to
remain
behind
partly
in
compliance
with
major
burney
advice
and
desire
but
particularly
in
the
hope
of
being
useful
as
an
interpreter
and
negotiator
and
a
preventer
of
bloodshed
with
painful
pleasure
i
took
a
hasty
leave
of
my
dear
family
and
in
the
evening
the
diana
left
us
not
however
without
having
several
shots
from
cannon
or
jinjals
fired
at
her
from
the
people
on
the
city
wall
the
english
forces
small
and
weak
and
sick
as
they
were
were
now
throwing
up
and
on
saturday
the
inst
it
was
agreed
to
make
an
attack
on
the
town
in
order
if
possible
to
take
from
the
walls
the
large
guns
that
bore
upon
us
and
to
try
the
strength
of
the
rebel
party
i
stood
at
the
post
of
observation
with
a
to
watch
and
give
the
earliest
notice
of
the
event
and
soon
had
the
pleasure
of
announcing
that
the
officers
and
sepoys
had
scaled
the
walls
and
were
pitching
down
outside
the
large
guns
that
were
mounted
there
while
friendly
chinese
were
employed
in
carrying
them
to
the
wharf
the
success
was
complete
and
nothing
remained
but
to
rescue
the
prisoners
in
number
whom
the
rebels
had
caught
and
confined
after
a
short
cessation
and
a
little
refreshment
a
second
attack
was
made
during
which
the
prisoners
escaped
and
the
rebels
evacuated
the
city
a
second
battery
of
guns
was
also
taken
and
brought
to
the
wharf
in
the
morning
we
walked
at
large
through
the
town
but
what
desolation
what
barbarous
destruction
was
everywhere
exhibited
everything
that
could
not
be
carried
away
had
been
cut
and
destroyed
in
the
most
wanton
manner
our
own
house
was
cut
to
pieces
our
books
cut
scattered
torn
and
destroyed
our
furniture
either
carried
off
or
cut
or
broken
in
pieces
and
the
house
itself
and
zayat
converted
into
and
barracks
during
the
last
three
days
we
have
been
picking
up
the
scattered
fragments
of
our
furniture
books
and
repairing
our
house
the
ringleader
of
the
rebellion
and
eleven
of
his
principal
adherents
have
been
caught
the
inhabitants
are
coming
in
with
white
flags
and
occupying
their
houses
the
bazaar
is
open
and
the
work
of
repairs
is
going
on
yesterday
morning
the
diana
arrived
with
a
reinforcement
of
european
soldiers
and
i
have
come
on
board
expecting
to
proceed
to
maulmain
immediately
my
present
plan
is
if
my
brethren
approve
to
return
with
my
family
and
resume
our
missionary
labors
as
before
the
native
members
of
our
church
now
scattered
will
probably
come
into
town
as
soon
as
they
hear
of
our
return
of
the
boarding
scholars
all
are
with
us
except
three
karens
my
letter
is
already
protracted
to
so
great
a
length
that
i
can
only
add
that
our
preservation
and
deliverance
from
such
imminent
danger
should
awaken
in
our
hearts
the
warmest
gratitude
to
our
heavenly
father
and
the
most
unwavering
confidence
in
his
kind
care
and
that
the
foregoing
account
should
revive
and
deepen
the
impression
made
by
previous
events
in
the
history
of
this
mission
that
we
stand
in
need
of
the
continual
and
fervent
prayers
of
christians
in
america
not
only
for
our
preservation
but
for
divine
guidance
in
all
our
affairs
i
remain
yours
boardman
morning
august
i
have
just
arrived
at
maulmain
and
have
the
happiness
to
find
my
family
and
missionary
friends
in
comfortable
health
praised
be
the
lord
for
his
goodness
after
much
deliberation
it
is
thought
best
that
i
should
leave
my
family
here
till
affairs
are
more
settled
i
expect
to
embark
for
tavoy
morning
may
the
spirit
of
all
grace
go
with
me
this
is
a
plain
unvarnished
account
of
the
terrible
scene
through
which
the
missionaries
were
so
wonderfully
preserved
but
to
understand
more
fully
their
imminent
peril
we
should
know
that
the
town
at
the
time
of
the
revolt
was
almost
defenceless
the
english
civil
and
military
chief
absent
the
officer
in
command
on
his
no
english
troops
in
the
town
and
but
about
a
hundred
sepoys
who
though
trained
to
british
modes
of
warfare
are
by
no
means
equal
in
skill
or
valor
to
british
troops
and
the
chief
engineer
disabled
by
sickness
the
tavoyans
had
well
chosen
the
time
of
their
attack
and
they
were
sufficiently
numerous
to
have
carried
all
their
plans
into
execution
but
the
result
like
that
of
all
conflicts
between
civilized
and
barbarous
men
shows
how
greatly
superior
a
few
troops
well
disciplined
are
to
the
most
numerous
bodies
of
men
unacquainted
with
the
art
of
war
but
what
could
be
more
appalling
to
the
stoutest
heart
than
the
situation
of
boardman
and
her
helpless
family
forced
to
flee
from
her
frail
hut
by
bullets
actually
whizzing
through
it
and
to
pass
through
the
town
amid
the
yells
of
an
infuriated
rabble
her
path
sometimes
impeded
by
the
dead
bodies
of
men
who
had
fallen
in
the
conflict
driven
from
the
shelter
of
the
government
house
again
to
fly
through
the
streets
to
the
and
there
with
three
or
four
hundred
fugitives
crowded
together
to
await
death
which
threatened
them
in
every
form
hearing
over
their
heads
the
rush
of
cannon
balls
and
seeing
from
burning
buildings
showers
of
sparks
falling
one
of
which
if
it
reached
the
magazines
under
their
roof
was
sufficient
to
tear
the
building
from
its
foundations
and
whelm
them
all
in
one
common
ruin
or
if
they
escaped
this
danger
to
know
that
hundreds
of
merciless
barbarians
with
knives
and
cutlasses
might
at
any
moment
rush
into
the
building
and
destroy
them
can
the
heart
we
are
ready
to
ask
such
fearful
trial
perchance
her
reason
stoops
or
reels
perchance
a
courage
not
her
own
braces
her
mind
to
desperate
tone
yes
her
mind
was
stayed
by
a
courage
not
her
own
but
it
was
braced
to
no
desperate
tone
rather
its
calmness
was
that
of
a
child
who
in
its
own
utter
helplessness
clings
to
its
father
arm
and
feels
secure
neither
must
we
forget
that
a
painful
diversion
of
her
thoughts
from
the
terrors
around
her
was
afforded
by
the
necessities
of
her
suffering
babe
to
whom
the
foul
air
of
the
and
the
want
of
all
comforts
had
nearly
proved
fatal
it
was
only
her
sleepless
vigilant
care
that
under
providence
prevented
the
poor
child
from
sharing
the
fate
of
burney
little
infant
which
did
not
survive
the
dreadful
scene
and
with
what
transports
of
joy
did
this
suffering
company
hail
the
sight
of
the
thin
blue
smoke
that
heralded
the
arrival
of
a
steamer
from
maulmain
amid
what
distracting
fears
for
her
husband
left
in
the
revolted
city
her
infant
and
herself
did
boardman
decide
to
go
on
board
the
steamer
returning
to
maulmain
and
with
what
gratitude
and
joy
did
she
after
several
days
of
painful
suspense
welcome
to
the
same
city
her
husband
and
hear
the
tidings
of
the
triumph
of
british
power
and
the
restoration
of
tranquillity
in
her
happiness
at
meeting
him
alive
she
noticed
not
that
his
late
exposure
and
sufferings
had
increased
to
an
alarming
degree
the
symptoms
of
his
dreadful
malady
inspired
with
something
of
his
own
enthusiasm
she
saw
him
depart
to
return
to
his
beloved
labors
in
tavoy
whither
she
hoped
and
expected
soon
to
follow
him
chapter
missionary
labors
of
boardman
his
ill
letter
from
mrs
death
of
a
second
letters
from
b
from
boardman
journal
we
learn
that
he
remained
through
the
summer
and
part
of
the
autumn
at
tavoy
diligently
prosecuting
his
labors
among
the
burmese
chinese
karens
and
europeans
among
all
which
classes
he
had
singular
success
in
the
meantime
boardman
continued
at
maulmain
part
of
the
time
suffering
from
illness
and
when
able
assisting
the
missionaries
there
until
october
when
she
returned
again
to
tavoy
the
animated
and
even
glowing
recital
given
by
boardman
in
his
journals
and
letters
of
this
year
of
the
spread
of
gospel
truth
among
the
natives
his
records
of
preaching
travelling
teaching
and
baptisms
would
lead
one
to
suppose
that
he
was
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
most
vigorous
health
and
that
his
frame
was
insensible
to
fatigue
but
careless
as
he
was
of
his
own
bodily
ease
there
was
an
eye
that
watched
him
with
the
intensest
solicitude
a
heart
that
was
pierced
with
anxiety
knowing
that
though
the
inner
man
was
renewed
day
by
day
the
outer
man
was
too
surely
perishing
and
would
soon
be
laid
aside
forever

the
of
july
boardman
writes
to
her
sister
from
maulmain
whither
they
had
gone
for
the
benefit
of
her
health
we
must
look
beyond
this
frail
fleeting
world
for
our
true
peace
alas
i
know
by
most
bitter
experience
that
it
is
in
vain
to
seek
for
true
happiness
here
below
my
fondest
earthly
hopes
have
again
and
again
been
dashed
torn
from
the
bosom
of
my
dear
father
family
my
heart
was
almost
broken
and
when
i
stood
by
the
of
my
sweet
my
lovely
sarah
i
felt
indeed
that
earthly
hopes
and
joys
are
but
a
dream
but
a
hangs
over
me
oh
what
desolation
and
anguish
of
spirit
do
i
feel
when
i
think
it
is
possible
that
in
a
few
more
months
my
earthly
guide
supporter
and
delight
may
be
no
more
he
has
a
cough
which
has
been
hanging
about
him
a
year
and
he
is
very
much
reduced
by
it
oh
my
sister
let
us
see
to
it
that
our
affections
are
set
on
things
above
such
desolation
and
anguish
of
spirit
as
she
here
describes
had
her
husband
felt
for
in
the
preceding
year
when
for
some
months
before
and
after
the
birth
of
her
second
son
she
lay
struggling
with
a
dangerous
disease
which
he
thought
would
surely
terminate
her
life
at
that
time
he
wrote
she
still
grows
weaker
and
her
case
is
now
more
alarming
should
our
friends
for
whom
i
have
sent
to
maulmain
come
even
immediately
i
can
scarcely
hope
for
their
arrival
before
the
crisis
or
probably
fatal
termination
of
my
dear
partner
disorder
my
comfort
in
my
present
affliction
is
the
thought
that
if
to
our
former
trials
the
lord
sees
fit
to
add
that
of
removing
my
beloved
companion
he
does
it
with
a
perfect
knowledge
of
all
the
blessedness
which
death
will
confer
on
and
of
all
the
sorrows
and
distresses
which
her
loss
will
occasion
her
bereaved
husband
and
orphan
children
in
our
present
peculiar
condition
it
affords
me
great
relief
to
have
been
assured
by
her
that
the
bitterness
of
death
is
past
and
that
heavenly
glories
have
been
unfolded
in
a
wonderful
and
unexpected
manner
to
her
view
and
again
he
says
seemingly
losing
for
a
moment
his
strong
confidence
what
will
become
of
my
children
what
will
become
of
the
schools
of
the
poor
native
women
what
will
become
of
if
she
die
but
she
recovered
and
his
thankfulness
knew
no
bounds
his
letters
are
eloquent
in
their
utterance
of
joy
and
praise
in
a
letter
of
boardman
records
another
affliction
god
has
come
very
near
to
us
and
wounded
our
hearts
afresh
our
youngest
child
aged
months
went
from
us
to
meet
his
sainted
sister
in
september
last
we
mourn
but
not
without
hope
for
we
shall
soon
be
in
that
blissful
world
be
pure
and
lovely
like
our
departed
ones
in
glory
and
boardman
says
our
hearts
have
been
pierced
anew
by
the
loss
of
our
dear
babe
he
was
months
old
and
though
generally
feeble
one
of
the
most
lovely
and
interesting
of
babes
the
lord
has
dealt
with
us
severely
but
not
unkindly
he
gave
and
he
hath
taken
away
both
these
devoted
missionaries
knew
however
that
the
best
defence
against
such
trials
as
they
endured
is
found
in
a
steady
performance
of
duty
in
trouble
as
well
as
in
joy
they
devoted
themselves
to
their
great
object
saving
how
different
from
those
who
make
a
sort
of
merit
of
indulging
the
luxury
of
grief
and
show
their
regard
for
the
memory
of
the
dead
by
neglecting
their
duties
to
the
living
christianity
while
it
inculcates
and
fosters
the
tenderest
sensibility
to
the
chastisements
of
our
heavenly
parent
never
allows
us
in
any
calamity
to
fold
our
hands
in
inactive
despair
our
pathway
is
filled
with
duties
and
heart
within
and
god
head
we
must
like
our
master
go
about
doing
good
though
we
may
feel
cast
down
pressed
out
of
measure
by
affliction
speaking
of
a
severe
illness
about
this
time
boardman
says
death
seemed
near
but
had
no
alarms
no
terrors
my
beloved
family
and
the
perishing
heathen
were
all
that
made
me
in
the
least
degree
unwilling
to
die
and
even
them
i
could
resign
to
the
hands
of
a
gracious
and
god
in
one
of
the
last
letters
he
ever
wrote
he
thus
records
his
testimony
to
the
devotedness
of
his
beloved
wife
during
my
present
protracted
illness
and
when
i
was
at
the
worst
stage
she
was
the
tenderest
most
assiduous
attentive
and
affectionate
of
nurses
without
her
i
think
i
should
have
finished
my
career
in
a
few
days
and
even
when
our
lamented
darling
babe
lay
struggling
in
the
very
arms
of
death
though
she
was
with
him
constantly
night
and
day
she
did
not
allow
me
to
suffer
one
moment
for
lack
of
her
attentions
i
can
not
write
what
i
feel
on
this
tender
subject
but
oh
what
kindness
in
our
heavenly
father
that
when
her
services
were
so
much
needed
her
health
was
preserved
and
she
had
strength
given
her
to
perform
her
arduous
labors
boardman
life
was
now
fast
ebbing
away
in
september
he
had
written
a
sort
of
farewell
to
his
parents
brothers
and
sisters
from
which
it
appears
that
even
then
he
was
daily
looking
for
the
summons
come
up
hither
he
says
of
this
letter
that
it
is
his
last
farewell
he
thanks
god
that
he
has
his
complaint
consumption
in
its
mildest
form
he
enumerates
many
circumstances
of
mercy
with
which
he
is
favored
and
adds
but
most
of
all
for
outward
comfort
i
have
my
beloved
wife
whose
most
untiring
assiduity
has
mitigated
many
of
my
pains
and
who
is
ever
prompt
to
render
all
the
services
that
the
purest
affection
can
dictate
or
the
greatest
sufferings
require
and
it
deserves
to
be
mentioned
that
she
has
never
been
so
free
from
missionary
and
family
cares
or
from
attacks
of
illness
as
during
the
last
three
months
while
i
have
most
needed
her
kind
and
soothing
attentions
bless
the
lord
oh
my
soul
and
praise
his
name
in
thinking
he
adds
on
the
probability
of
dying
soon
two
or
three
things
occasion
considerable
unwillingness
to
meet
the
solemn
event
one
is
the
sore
affliction
i
know
it
will
occasion
to
my
dear
family
especially
my
fond
too
fond
wife
her
heart
will
be
riven
but
i
must
leave
her
with
him
who
is
anointed
to
heal
the
and
to
bind
up
their
wounds
my
dear
little
son
is
too
young
to
remember
me
long
or
to
realize
his
loss
i
have
prayed
for
him
many
times
and
can
leave
him
in
my
heavenly
father
hands
then
there
are
the
perishing
heathens
around
me
during
the
last
ten
years
i
have
studied
with
more
or
less
reference
to
being
useful
to
the
heathen
and
now
if
just
as
i
am
beginning
to
be
qualified
to
labor
a
little
among
them
my
days
are
cut
short
much
of
my
study
and
preparation
seems
to
be
in
vain
but
i
chide
myself
for
saying
so
or
thinking
so
if
i
had
done
no
good
whatever
here
in
burmah
i
ought
to
submit
and
be
still
under
the
hand
of
god
but
i
trust
he
has
made
me
of
some
service
to
a
few
poor
benighted
souls
especially
among
the
karens
who
shall
be
my
glory
and
joy
in
the
day
of
the
lord
jesus
as
to
my
hope
and
my
confidence
of
acceptance
with
god
if
any
man
has
reason
to
renounce
all
his
own
righteousness
and
to
trust
entirely
and
solely
to
grace
sovereign
grace
flowing
through
an
atoning
saviour
i
am
that
man
a
perfectly
right
action
with
perfectly
right
motives
i
never
performed
and
never
shall
perform
till
freed
from
this
body
of
sin
an
unprofitable
servant
is
the
most
appropriate
epitaph
for
my
tombstone
thus
appeared
a
life
of
sacrifices
for
christ
when
shone
upon
by
the
pure
light
of
eternity
happy
then
that
the
dying
man
could
say
not
by
works
of
righteousness
which
we
have
done
but
by
his
mercy
he
saves
us

in
this
city
by
moung
ing
and
in
their
native
wilderness
by
mason
mason
arrived
and
on
the
he
with
boardman
myself
and
george
set
out
on
a
tour
among
the
karens
boardman
was
very
feeble
but
we
hoped
the
change
of
air
and
scenery
would
be
beneficial
a
company
of
karens
had
come
to
convey
us
out
boardman
on
his
bed
and
me
in
a
chair
we
reached
the
place
on
the
third
day
and
found
they
had
erected
a
bamboo
chapel
on
a
beautiful
stream
at
the
base
of
a
range
of
mountains
the
place
was
central
and
nearly
one
hundred
persons
had
assembled
more
than
half
of
them
applicants
for
baptism
oh
it
was
a
sight
calculated
to
call
forth
the
liveliest
joy
of
which
human
nature
is
susceptible
and
made
me
for
a
moment
forget
my
bitter
griefs
a
sight
far
surpassing
all
i
had
ever
anticipated
even
in
my
most
sanguine
hours
the
karens
cooked
ate
and
slept
on
the
around
by
the
with
no
other
shelter
than
the
trees
of
the
forest
three
years
ago
they
were
sunk
in
the
lowest
depths
of
ignorance
and
superstition
now
the
glad
tidings
of
mercy
had
reached
them
and
they
were
willing
to
live
in
the
open
air
away
from
their
homes
for
the
sake
of
enjoying
the
privileges
of
the
gospel
my
dear
husband
had
borne
the
journey
better
than
we
had
feared
though
he
suffered
from
exhaustion
and
pain
in
his
side
which
however
was
much
relieved
by
a
little
attention
his
spirits
were
unusually
good
and
we
fondly
hoped
that
a
few
days
residence
in
that
delightful
airy
spot
surrounded
by
his
loved
karens
would
recruit
and
invigorate
his
weakened
frame
but
i
soon
perceived
he
was
failing
and
tenderly
urged
his
return
to
town
where
he
could
enjoy
the
quiet
of
home
and
the
benefit
of
medical
advice
but
he
repelled
the
thought
at
once
saying
he
confidently
expected
improvement
from
the
change
and
that
the
disappointment
would
be
worse
for
him
than
staying
even
added
he
my
poor
unprofitable
life
be
somewhat
shortened
by
staying
ought
i
on
that
account
merely
to
leave
this
interesting
field
should
i
not
rather
stay
and
assist
in
gathering
in
these
dear
scattered
lambs
of
the
fold
you
know
sarah
that
coming
on
a
foreign
mission
involves
the
probability
of
a
shorter
life
than
staying
in
native
country
and
yet
obedience
to
our
lord
and
compassion
for
the
perishing
heathen
induced
us
to
make
this
sacrifice
and
have
we
ever
repented
that
we
came
no
i
trust
we
can
both
say
that
we
bless
god
for
bringing
us
to
burmah
for
directing
our
footsteps
to
tavoy
and
even
for
leading
us
hither
you
already
know
my
love
he
continued
with
a
look
of
tenderness
never
to
be
forgotten
i
can
not
live
long
i
must
sink
under
this
disease
and
should
we
go
home
now
the
business
which
brought
us
out
must
be
given
up
and
i
might
linger
out
a
few
days
of
suffering
stung
with
the
reflection
that
i
had
preferred
a
few
idle
days
to
my
master
service
do
not
therefore
ask
me
to
go
till
these
poor
karens
have
been
baptized
i
saw
he
was
right
but
my
feelings
revolted
nothing
seemed
so
valuable
as
his
life
and
i
felt
that
i
could
make
any
sacrifice
to
prolong
it
though
it
were
but
for
one
hour
still
a
desire
to
gratify
him
if
no
higher
motive
made
me
silent
though
my
heart
ached
to
see
him
so
ill
in
such
a
wretched
place
deprived
of
many
of
the
comforts
of
life
to
say
nothing
of
the
indulgences
desirable
in
sickness
the
chapel
was
large
but
open
on
all
sides
excepting
a
small
place
built
up
for
mason
and
a
room
about
five
feet
wide
and
ten
feet
long
for
the
accommodation
of
boardman
and
myself
with
our
little
boy
the
roof
was
so
low
that
i
could
not
stand
upright
and
it
was
but
poorly
enclosed
so
that
he
was
exposed
to
the
burning
rays
of
the
sun
by
day
and
to
the
cold
winds
and
damp
fog
by
night
but
his
mind
was
happy
and
he
would
often
say
i
live
to
see
this
one
ingathering
i
may
well
exclaim
with
happy
simeon
lord
now
lettest
thou
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
according
to
thy
word
for
mine
eyes
have
seen
thy
salvation
how
many
ministers
have
wished
they
might
die
in
their
pulpits
and
would
not
dying
in
a
spot
like
this
be
even
more
blessed
than
dying
in
a
pulpit
at
home
i
feel
that
it
would
nor
was
it
merely
the
pleasing
state
of
things
around
him
that
filled
his
mind
with
comfort
he
would
sometimes
dwell
on
the
infinite
compassion
of
god
and
his
own
unworthiness
till
his
strength
was
quite
exhausted
and
though
he
told
mason
that
he
had
not
the
rapture
which
he
had
sometimes
enjoyed
yet
his
mind
was
calm
and
peaceful
and
it
was
plainly
perceptible
that
earthly
passions
had
died
way
and
that
he
was
enjoying
sweet
foretastes
of
that
rest
into
which
he
was
so
soon
to
enter
he
would
often
say
to
me
meditations
are
very
sweet
though
my
mind
seems
as
much
weakened
as
my
body
i
have
not
had
that
liveliness
of
feeling
which
i
have
sometimes
enjoyed
owing
to
my
great
weakness
but
i
shall
soon
be
released
from
shackles
and
be
where
i
can
praise
god
continually
without
weariness
my
thoughts
delight
to
dwell
on
these
words
is
no
night
i
felt
that
the
time
of
separation
was
fast
approaching
and
said
to
him
dear
i
have
one
request
to
make
it
is
that
you
would
pray
much
for
george
during
your
few
remaining
days
i
shall
soon
be
left
alone
almost
the
only
one
on
earth
to
pray
for
him
and
i
have
great
confidence
in
your
dying
prayers
he
looked
earnestly
at
the
little
boy
and
said
will
try
to
pray
for
him
but
i
trust
very
many
prayers
will
ascend
for
the
dear
child
from
our
friends
at
home
who
will
be
induced
to
supplicate
the
more
earnestly
for
him
when
they
hear
that
he
is
left
fatherless
in
a
heathen
land
on
wednesday
while
looking
in
the
glass
he
seemed
at
once
to
see
symptoms
of
his
approaching
dissolution
and
said
without
emotion
have
altered
greatly
i
am
sinking
into
the
grave
very
fast
just
on
the
verge
mason
said
to
him
there
nothing
we
can
do
for
you
had
we
not
better
call
the
physician
or
shall
we
try
to
remove
you
into
town
immediately
after
a
few
deliberation
it
was
concluded
to
defer
the
baptism
of
the
male
applicants
and
set
out
for
home
early
the
next
morning
nearly
all
the
female
candidates
had
been
examined
and
as
it
is
difficult
for
them
to
come
to
town
it
was
thought
best
that
mason
should
baptize
them
in
the
evening
we
knelt
and
mason
having
prayed
for
a
blessing
on
the
decision
we
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
sorrowful
hearts
while
we
were
at
the
table
my
beloved
husband
said
shall
soon
be
thrown
away
for
this
world
but
i
hope
the
lord
jesus
will
take
me
up
that
merciful
being
who
is
represented
as
passing
by
and
having
compassion
on
the
poor
infant
will
not
suffer
me
to
perish
o
i
have
no
hope
but
in
the
wonderful
condescending
infinite
mercy
of
god
through
his
dear
son
i
cast
my
poor
perishing
soul
loaded
with
sin
as
it
is
upon
his
compassionate
arms
assured
that
all
will
he
forever
safe
on
seeing
my
tears
he
said
you
not
reconciled
to
the
will
of
god
my
love
when
i
told
him
i
hoped
i
did
not
feel
unreconciled
he
continued
have
long
ago
and
many
times
committed
you
and
our
little
one
into
the
hands
of
our
covenant
god
he
is
the
husband
of
the
widow
and
the
father
of
the
fatherless
thy
fatherless
children
i
will
preserve
them
alive
and
let
thy
widows
trust
in
saith
the
lord
he
will
be
your
stay
and
support
when
i
am
gone
the
separation
will
be
but
short
o
how
happy
i
shall
be
to
welcome
you
to
heaven
he
then
addressed
mason
as
follows
i
am
heartily
rejoiced
and
bless
god
that
you
have
arrived
and
especially
am
i
gratified
that
you
are
so
much
interested
for
the
poor
karens
you
will
i
am
assured
watch
over
them
and
take
care
of
them
and
if
some
of
them
turn
back
you
will
still
care
for
them
as
to
my
dear
wife
and
child
i
know
you
will
do
all
in
your
power
to
make
them
comfortable
will
probably
spend
the
ensuing
rains
in
tavoy
she
will
be
happy
with
you
and
mason
that
is
as
happy
as
she
can
be
in
her
state
of
loneliness
she
will
mourn
for
me
and
a
widow
state
is
desolate
and
sorrowful
at
best
but
god
will
he
infinitely
better
to
her
than
i
have
ever
been
on
the
same
day
he
wished
me
to
read
some
hymns
on
affliction
sickness
death
i
took
wesley
hymn
book
the
only
one
we
had
with
us
and
read
several
among
others
the
one
beginning
lovely
appearance
of
death
on
wednesday
evening
persons
were
baptized
boardman
was
carried
to
the
waterside
though
so
weak
that
he
could
hardly
breathe
without
the
continual
use
of
the
fan
and
the
the
joyful
sight
was
almost
too
much
for
his
feeble
frame
when
we
reached
the
chapel
he
said
he
would
like
to
sit
up
and
take
tea
with
us
we
placed
his
cot
near
the
table
and
having
bolstered
him
up
we
took
tea
together
he
asked
the
blessing
and
did
it
with
his
right
hand
upraised
and
in
a
tone
that
struck
me
to
the
heart
it
was
the
same
tremulous
yet
urgent
and
i
had
almost
said
unearthly
voice
with
which
my
aged
grandfather
used
to
pray
we
now
began
to
notice
that
brightening
of
the
mental
faculties
which
i
had
heard
spoken
of
in
persons
near
their
end
after
tea
was
removed
all
the
disciples
present
about
fifty
in
number
gathered
around
him
and
he
addressed
them
for
a
few
moments
in
language
like
the
following
did
hope
to
stay
with
you
till
after
and
administer
to
you
once
more
the
lord
supper
but
god
is
calling
me
away
from
you
i
am
about
to
die
and
shall
soon
be
inconceivably
happy
in
heaven
when
i
am
gone
remember
what
i
have
taught
you
and
o
be
careful
to
persevere
unto
the
end
that
when
you
die
we
may
meet
one
another
in
the
presence
of
god
never
more
to
part
listen
to
the
word
of
the
new
teacher
and
the
teacheress
as
you
have
done
to
mine
the
teacheress
will
be
very
much
distressed
strive
to
lighten
her
burdens
and
comfort
her
by
your
good
conduct
do
not
neglect
prayer
the
eternal
god
to
whom
you
pray
is
unchangeable
earthly
teachers
sicken
and
die
but
god
remains
forever
the
same
love
jesus
christ
with
all
your
hearts
and
you
will
be
forever
safe
this
address
i
gathered
from
the
karens
as
i
was
absent
preparing
his
things
for
the
night
having
rested
a
few
minutes
he
offered
a
short
prayer
and
then
with
mason
assistance
distributed
tracts
and
portions
of
scripture
to
them
all
early
the
next
morning
we
left
for
home
accompanied
by
nearly
all
the
males
and
some
of
the
females
the
remainder
returning
to
their
homes
in
the
wilderness
boardman
was
free
from
pain
during
the
day
and
there
was
no
unfavorable
change
except
that
his
mouth
grew
sore
but
at
four
in
the
afternoon
we
were
overtaken
by
a
violent
shower
of
rain
accompanied
by
lightning
and
thunder
there
was
no
house
in
sight
and
we
were
obliged
to
remain
in
the
open
air
exposed
to
the
merciless
storm
we
covered
him
with
mats
and
blankets
and
held
our
umbrellas
over
him
all
to
no
purpose
i
was
obliged
to
stand
and
see
the
storm
beating
upon
him
till
his
mattress
and
pillows
were
drenched
with
rain
we
hastened
on
and
soon
came
to
a
tavoy
house
the
inhabitants
at
first
refused
us
admittance
and
we
ran
for
shelter
into
the
the
shed
i
happened
to
enter
proved
to
be
the
of
their
gods
and
thus
i
committed
an
almost
unpardonable
offence
after
some
persuasion
they
admitted
us
into
the
house
or
rather
verandah
for
they
would
not
allow
us
to
sleep
inside
though
i
begged
the
privilege
for
my
sick
husband
with
tears
in
ordinary
cases
perhaps
they
would
have
been
hospitable
but
they
knew
that
boardman
was
a
teacher
of
a
foreign
religion
and
that
the
karens
in
our
company
had
embraced
that
religion
at
evening
worship
boardman
requested
mason
to
read
the
psalm
he
seemed
almost
spent
and
said
poor
perishing
dust
will
soon
be
laid
in
the
grave
but
god
can
employ
other
lumps
of
clay
to
perform
his
will
as
easily
as
he
has
this
poor
unworthy
one
i
told
him
i
should
like
to
sit
up
and
watch
by
him
but
he
objected
and
said
in
a
tender
supplicating
tone
can
not
we
sleep
together
the
rain
still
continued
and
his
cot
was
wet
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
lie
on
the
bamboo
floor
having
found
a
place
where
our
little
boy
could
sleep
without
danger
of
falling
through
openings
in
the
floor
i
threw
myself
down
without
undressing
beside
my
beloved
husband
i
spoke
to
him
often
during
the
night
and
he
said
he
felt
well
excepting
an
uncomfortable
feeling
in
his
mouth
and
throat
this
was
somewhat
relieved
by
frequent
washings
with
cold
water
miserably
wretched
as
his
situation
was
he
did
not
complain
on
the
contrary
his
heart
seemed
overflowing
with
gratitude
said
he
kind
and
good
our
father
in
heaven
is
to
me
how
many
are
racked
with
pain
while
i
though
near
the
grave
am
almost
free
from
distress
of
body
i
suffer
nothing
to
what
you
my
dear
sarah
had
to
endure
last
year
when
i
thought
i
must
lose
you
and
then
i
have
you
to
move
me
so
tenderly
i
should
have
sunk
into
the
grave
ere
this
but
for
your
assiduous
attention
and
brother
mason
is
as
kind
to
me
as
if
he
were
my
own
brother
and
then
how
many
in
addition
to
pain
of
body
have
anguish
of
soul
while
my
mind
is
sweetly
stayed
on
god
on
my
saying
hope
we
shall
be
at
home
night
where
you
can
lie
on
your
comfortable
bed
and
i
can
nurse
you
as
i
wish
he
said
want
nothing
that
the
world
can
afford
but
my
wife
and
friends
earthly
conveniences
and
comforts
are
of
little
consequence
to
one
so
near
heaven
i
only
want
them
for
your
sake
in
the
morning
we
thought
him
a
little
better
though
i
perceived
when
i
gave
him
his
sago
that
his
breath
was
very
short
he
however
took
rather
more
nourishment
than
usual
and
spoke
about
the
manner
of
his
conveyance
home
we
ascertained
that
by
waiting
until
twelve
we
could
go
the
greater
part
of
the
way
by
water
at
about
nine
his
hands
and
feet
grew
cold
and
the
affectionate
karens
rubbed
them
all
the
forenoon
excepting
a
few
moments
when
he
requested
to
be
left
alone
at
ten
he
was
much
distressed
for
breath
and
i
thought
the
long
dreaded
moment
had
arrived
i
asked
him
if
he
felt
as
if
he
was
going
home
just
yet
he
replied
on
giving
him
a
little
wine
and
water
he
revived
shortly
after
he
said
were
alarmed
without
cause
just
now
dear
i
know
the
reason
of
the
distress
i
felt
but
am
too
weak
to
explain
it
to
you
in
a
few
moments
he
said
to
me
you
spoke
to
me
about
george
i
have
prayed
for
him
almost
incessantly
more
than
in
all
my
life
before
it
drew
near
twelve
the
time
for
us
to
go
to
the
boat
we
were
distressed
at
the
thought
of
removing
him
when
evidently
so
near
the
last
struggle
though
we
did
not
think
it
so
near
as
it
really
was
but
there
was
no
alternative
the
chilling
frown
of
the
tavoyan
was
to
us
as
if
he
was
continually
saying
gone
i
wanted
a
little
broth
for
my
expiring
husband
but
on
asking
them
for
a
fowl
they
said
they
had
none
though
at
that
instant
on
glancing
my
eye
through
an
opening
in
the
floor
i
saw
three
or
four
under
the
house
my
heart
was
well
nigh
breaking
we
hastened
to
the
boat
which
was
only
a
few
steps
from
the
house
the
karens
carried
boardman
first
and
as
the
shore
was
muddy
i
was
obliged
to
wait
till
they
could
return
for
me
they
took
me
immediately
to
him
but
o
the
agony
of
my
soul
when
i
saw
the
hand
of
death
was
on
him
he
was
looking
me
full
in
the
face
but
his
eyes
were
changed
not
dimmed
but
brightened
and
the
pupils
so
dilated
that
i
feared
he
could
not
see
me
i
spoke
to
him
kissed
him
but
he
made
no
return
though
i
fancied
that
he
tried
to
move
his
lips
i
pressed
his
hand
knowing
that
if
he
could
he
would
return
the
pressure
but
alas
for
the
first
time
he
was
insensible
to
my
love
and
forever
i
had
brought
a
glass
of
wine
and
water
already
mixed
and
a
but
neither
was
of
any
avail
to
him
now
agreeably
to
a
previous
request
i
called
the
faithful
karens
who
loved
him
so
much
and
whom
he
had
loved
unto
death
to
come
and
watch
his
last
gentle
breathings
for
there
was
no
struggle
never
my
dear
parents
did
one
of
our
poor
fallen
race
have
less
to
contend
with
in
the
last
enemy
little
george
was
brought
to
see
his
dying
father
but
he
was
too
young
to
know
there
was
cause
for
grief
when
sarah
died
her
father
said
to
george
little
boy
you
will
not
know
what
you
have
lost
a
deep
pang
rent
my
bosom
at
the
recollection
of
this
and
a
still
deeper
one
succeeded
when
the
thought
struck
me
that
though
my
little
boy
may
not
know
what
he
has
lost
yet
when
years
have
rolled
by
and
he
shall
have
felt
the
unkindness
of
a
deceitful
selfish
world
will
mason
wept
and
the
sorrowing
karens
knelt
down
in
prayer
to
god
that
god
of
whom
their
expiring
teacher
had
taught
them
that
god
into
whose
presence
the
emancipated
spirit
was
just
entering
that
god
with
whom
they
hope
and
expect
to
be
happy
forever
my
own
feelings
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
you
may
have
some
faint
idea
of
them
when
you
recollect
what
he
was
to
me
how
tenderly
i
loved
him
and
at
the
same
time
bear
in
mind
the
precious
promises
to
the
afflicted
we
came
in
silence
down
the
river
and
landed
about
three
miles
from
our
house
the
karens
placed
his
precious
remains
on
his
little
bed
and
with
feelings
which
you
can
better
imagine
than
i
describe
we
proceeded
homewards
the
mournful
intelligence
had
reached
town
before
us
and
we
were
soon
met
by
moung
ing
the
burman
preacher
at
the
sight
of
us
he
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
next
we
met
the
two
native
christian
sisters
who
lived
with
us
but
the
moment
of
most
bitter
anguish
was
yet
to
come
on
our
arrival
at
the
house
they
took
him
into
the
and
when
i
uncovered
his
face
for
a
few
moments
nothing
was
heard
but
reiterated
sobs
he
had
not
altered
the
same
sweet
smile
with
which
he
was
wont
to
welcome
me
sat
on
his
countenance
his
eyes
had
opened
in
bringing
him
and
all
present
seemed
expecting
to
hear
his
voice
when
the
thought
that
it
was
silent
forever
rushed
upon
us
and
filled
us
with
anguish
sudden
and
unutterable
there
were
the
burman
christians
who
had
listened
so
long
with
edification
and
delight
to
his
preaching
there
were
the
karens
who
looked
to
him
as
their
guide
their
earthly
all
there
were
the
scholars
whom
he
had
taught
the
way
to
heaven
and
the
christian
sisters
whose
privilege
it
had
been
to
wash
as
it
were
his
feet
early
next
morning
his
funeral
was
attended
and
all
the
europeans
in
the
place
with
many
natives
were
present
it
may
be
some
consolation
to
you
to
know
that
everything
was
performed
in
as
decent
a
manner
as
if
he
had
been
buried
in
our
own
dear
native
land
by
his
own
request
he
was
interred
on
the
south
side
of
our
darling
it
is
a
pleasant
circumstance
to
me
that
they
sleep
by
but
it
is
infinitely
more
consoling
to
think
that
their
glorified
spirits
have
met
in
that
blissful
world
where
sin
and
death
never
enter
and
sorrow
is
unknown
praying
that
we
may
be
abundantly
prepared
to
enter
into
our
glorious
rest

that
were
brought
in
during

two
preceding
years
disabled
by
wounds
he
was
obliged
through
the
whole
of
his
last
expedition
to
be
carried
on
a
litter
but
his
presence
was
a
host
and
the
holy
spirit
accompanied
his
dying
whispers
with
almighty
influence
such
a
death
next
to
that
of
martyrdom
must
be
glorious
in
the
eyes
of
heaven
well
may
we
rest
assured
that

decision
to
remain
in
her
missionary
her
schools
boardman
found
the
society
of
and
mason
a
sweet
solace
to
her
sad
heart
they
joined
her
at

in
the
spring
of
and
assisted
her
in
her
school
besides
studying
the
language
her
letters
to
her
sister
show
a
spirit
chastened
and
saddened
but
not
crushed
by
sorrow
and
still
tenderly
solicitous
for
the
spiritual
welfare
of
her
dear
brothers
and
sisters
in
america
she
urges
them
by
every
motive
to
embrace
that
saviour
she
had
found
so
precious
after
telling
them
of
the
glorious
revival
among
the
karens
and
of
the
baptism
of
of
them
she
asks
how
they
feel
when
they
hear
of
the
conversion
of
these
poor
children
of
the
wilderness
some
she
says
indeed
most
of
those
who
have
been
baptized
were
impressed
with
the
infinite
importance
of
religion
at
the
first
time
of
hearing
the
gospel
and
gave
themselves
no
rest
till
they
found
it
in
the
saviour
o
i
tremble
and
can
scarcely
hold
my
pen
while
i
think
of
the
awful
account
must
render
to
god
if
after
all
your
privileges
you
fall
short
of
heaven
at
last
how
can
you
resist
any
longer
you
can
not
you
will
not
something
tells
me
you
will
give
yourself
immediately
unreservedly
to
that
compassionate
saviour
whose
love
was
stronger
than
death
her
confidence
was
justified
for
some
months
later
she
says
dearly
beloved
brother
and
sister
a
parcel
of
letters
from
america
has
reached
us
which
we
eagerly
opened
and
received
the
delightful
intelligence
that
you
have
both
become
followers
of
jesus
and
have
openly
professed
his
name
and
that
two
others
of
the
dear
children
are
serious
oh
i
have
wept
hours
at
the
thought
of
god
goodness
in
giving
me
such
joyful
news
in
the
midst
of
my
sorrows
and
is
it
indeed
true
that
my
own
dear
harriet
and
my
dearly
loved
brother
are
adopted
into
the
family
of
god
chosen
ones
are
your
names
really
written
in
the
lamb
book
of
life
and
do
each
of
you
when
alone
in
your
closet
before
your
heavenly
father
feel
that
he
draws
near
to
you
and
that
sweeter
than
all
the
pleasures
of
the
world
is
communion
with
him
o
i
know
that
you
do
and
now
do
i
feel
a
union
with
you
unknown
before
how
sweet
to
feel
that
while
wandering
a
lonely
desolate
widow
some
of
those
whom
i
most
love
remember
me
every
day
before
a
throne
of
grace
now
when
i
kneel
in
prayer
the
voice
of
praise
is
on
my
lips
at
each
thought
of
home
my
heart
leaps
for
joy
and
i
feel
as
if
relieved
of
a
heavy
burden
which
continually
weighed
down
my
spirits
while
thinking
of
my
absent
brothers
and
sisters
the
accounts
of
the
glorious
revivals
in
different
parts
of
our
dear
native
land
have
greatly
refreshed
our
hearts
and
we
are
ready
to
exclaim
surely
the
millennium
has
dawned
for
happy
america
perhaps
you
think
such
intelligence
makes
me
wish
to
return
but
no
my
dear
brothers
and
sisters
it
makes
me
feel
just
the
reverse
i
do
most
ardently
long
to
labor
in
this
dark
land
till
the
day
dawns
upon
us
rather
i
should
say
till
the
sun
of
righteousness
reaches
the
of
burmah
for
the
day
has
already
dawned
and
the
eastern
karen
mountains
enveloped
for
ages
past
in
midnight
gloom
are
rejoicing
in
his
bright
beams
our
schools
are
very
flourishing
we
have
sixty
scholars
in
town
and
about
fifty
among
the
karens
in
the
jungles
i
feel
desolate
lonely
and
sometimes
deeply
distressed
at
my
great
and
irreparable
loss
but
i
bless
god
i
am
not
in
despair
my
darling
george
is
in
good
health
and
is
a
source
of
much
comfort
though
of
deep
anxiety
to
me
he
is
learning
to
read
but
is
not
so
forward
as
children
at
home
how
it
comforts
my
heart
to
be
able
to
ask
you
to
pray
for
him
in
a
hurried
postscript
she
adds
there
are
more
than
eighty
karens
at
our
house
upwards
of
twenty
of
them
applicants
for
baptism
in
another
letter
death
now
seems
nearer
to
me
and
heaven
dearer
than
before
i
was
afflicted
my
afflictions
are
precisely
the
kind
my
soul
needed
i
receive
from
my
dear
friends
the
masons
every
possible
kindness
but
alas
the
hours
of
loneliness
and
bitter
weeping
i
endure
are
known
only
to
god
but
still
jesus
has
sweetened
the
cup
and
i
would
not
that
it
should
have
passed
my
lip
three
courses
of
life
were
now
open
to
boardman
either
to
devote
herself
to
her
domestic
duties
manage
her
household
educate
her
darling
boy
and
in
quiet
seclusion
pass
the
weary
days
of
her
widowhood
or
looking
abroad
on
the
spiritual
wants
of
the
people
around
her
knowing
that
if
one
devoted
laborer
was
gone
there
was
the
more
need
of
activity
in
those
that
remained
she
might
continue
to
employ
her
time
and
faculties
in
instructing
and
elevating
those
in
whose
service
her
husband
had
worn
out
his
life
or
thirdly
she
might
take
her
child
her
only
one
and
return
to
the
land
of
her
birth
where
she
still
had
dear
parents
brothers
and
sisters
who
would
welcome
her
with
open
arms
and
where
she
could
give
her
son
those
advantages
which
he
never
could
have
in
a
heathen
land
to
adopt
either
the
first
or
the
last
of
these
courses
she
was
urged
by
her
natural
disposition
which
was
singularly
modest
and
retiring
her
feeble
health
the
enervating
influence
of
the
climate
and
above
all
by
the
strong
tendency
to
which
always
accompanies
a
sorrow
but
oh
she
says
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
these
poor
inquiring
and
christian
karens
and
the
and
the
burmese
christians
and
the
thought
of
made
her
more
than
willing
to
adopt
the
second
course
for
she
says
my
beloved
husband
wore
out
his
life
in
this
glorious
cause
and
that
remembrance
makes
me
more
than
ever
attached
to
the
work
and
the
people
for
whose
salvation
he
labored
till
death
during
her
husband
boardman
had
of
course
little
to
perform
of
what
could
properly
be
called
missionary
labor
even
her
teaching
in
the
schools
was
very
often
interrupted
by
sickness
and
the
schools
themselves
were
often
broken
up
by
untoward
events
which
the
missionaries
could
not
control
now
however
new
circumstances
called
her
to
new
and
untried
duties
yet
there
was
no
sudden
or
violent
change
in
her
mode
of
life
the
honored
lips
that
had
instructed
and
guided
and
comforted
the
ignorant
natives
were
sealed
in
death
yet
still
those
natives
continued
to
turn
their
eyes
and
their
steps
to
the
loved
residence
of
their
teacher
whenever
they
found
themselves
oppressed
with
difficulty
or
distress
and
could
the
widow
of
that
venerated
teacher
refuse
to
those
poor
disciples
any
guidance
or
consolation
it
was
in
her
power
to
bestow
no
quietly
and
meekly
she
instructed
the
ignorant
consoled
the
afflicted
led
inquirers
to
her
saviour
and
warned
the
impenitent
to
flee
to
him
and
if
insensibly
she
thus
came
to
fill
a
place
from
which
her
nature
would
instinctively
have
shrunk
there
was
still
about
her
such
a
modest
and
womanly
grace
combined
with
such
a
serious
and
dignified
purpose
of
soul
that
the
most
fastidious
could
have
found
nothing
to
censure
while
lovers
of
the
cause
she
had
espoused
found
everything
to
commend
i
rejoice
writes
a
friend
in
this
country
to
her
on
hearing
of
her
labors
that
your
husband
mantle
has
fallen
upon
you
and
that
more
than
ever
before
it
is
in
your
heart
to
benefit
the
heathen
that
her
duties
were
arduous
her
letters
fully
prove
in
one
of
them
she
says
every
moment
of
my
time
is
occupied
sunrise
till
ten
in
the
it
is
time
and
i
am
surrounded
by
five
karen
women
three
of
whom
arrived
this
afternoon
from
the
jungle
after
being
separated
from
us
nearly
five
months
by
the
heavy
rains
the
karens
are
beginning
to
come
to
us
in
companies
and
with
them
and
our
scholars
in
the
town
and
the
care
of
my
darling
boy
you
will
scarce
think
i
have
much
leisure
for
thus
she
toiled
on
cheered
by
the
consciousness
that
she
was
in
the
path
of
duty
that
her
husband
if
permitted
from
his
home
in
heaven
to
watch
over
the
spot
he
most
loved
on
earth
would
smile
approvingly
on
her
labors
and
encouraged
by
the
affection
of
many
of
the
disciples
and
the
interest
awakened
among
some
new
inquirers
but
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
her
trials
were
at
least
equal
to
her
encouragements
long
before
boardman
had
written
the
thoughts
of
this
people
the
burmans
run
in
channels
entirely
different
from
ours
their
whole
system
has
a
tendency
to
cramp
their
intellectual
powers
professedly
divine
in
its
origin
it
demands
credence
without
evidence
it
spurns
improvement
disdains
the
suggestions
of
experience
and
flatly
denies
the
testimony
of
the
external
senses
what
a
man
sees
with
his
own
eyes
he
is
not
to
believe
because
his
scriptures
teach
otherwise
there
is
no
fellowship
of
thought
between
them
and
us
on
any
subject
everything
appears
to
them
in
a
different
light
they
attribute
everything
to
a
different
cause
seek
a
remedy
of
evils
from
a
different
quarter
and
entertain
in
fine
a
set
of
thoughts
and
imaginations
totally
different
from
ours
the
karens
it
is
true
had
fewer
prejudices
to
be
eradicated
and
more
easily
sympathized
with
the
missionaries
than
the
haughty
burmans
but
then
their
very
docility
made
them
liable
to
another
danger
that
of
holding
their
new
faith
lightly
and
parting
with
it
easily
all
these
difficulties
sometimes
so
pressed
upon
boardman
that
she
was
ready
to
say
it
requires
the
patience
of
a
job
and
the
wisdom
of
a
solomon
to
get
on
with
this
people
much
as
i
love
them
and
good
as
i
think
they
are
she
then
spoke
of
the
in
whom
was
implanted
that
grace
which
so
far
as
it
operates
on
the
heart
makes
all
in
a
sense
in
christ
jesus
how
then
must
she
have
been
tried
with
those
who
would
not
repent
and
embrace
the
only
principles
that
could
give
her
the
least
fellowship
or
communion
with
them
boardman
writes
of
herself
and
her
and
mason
we
meet
with
much
encouragement
in
our
schools
and
our
number
of
is
now
about
eighty
these
with
the
boarding
schools
two
village
schools
and
about
fifty
persons
who
learn
during
the
rainy
season
in
the
karen
jungle
make
upwards
of
one
hundred
and
seventy
under
our
instruction
the
scholars
in
the
jungle
can
not
of
course
visit
us
often
but
a
great
many
have
come
to
be
examined
in
their
lessons
and
we
are
surprised
and
delighted
at
the
progress
they
have
made
of
course
they
had
to
employ
as
teachers
of
these
schools
natives
who
needed
constant
supervision
and
superintendence
some
of
these
teachers
were
exceedingly
interesting
persons
of
the
death
of
one
of
them
she
writes
continued
in
his
school
till
two
days
before
his
death
although
for
a
long
time
he
had
been
very
ill
he
felt
then
that
he
die
and
said
to
his
scholars
can
do
no
more
god
is
calling
me
away
from
you
i
go
into
his
presence
be
not
dismayed
he
was
then
carried
to
the
house
of
his
father
a
few
miles
distant
and
there
he
continued
exhorting
and
praying
to
the
very
last
moment
his
widow
who
is
not
yet
fifteen
is
one
of
the
loveliest
of
our
desert
blossoms
and
afterwards
in
alluding
to
the
same
event
she
says
one
of
our
best
karen
teachers
came
to
see
us
and
through
him
we
heard
that
the
disciples
were
well
that
they
were
living
in
love
in
the
enjoyment
of
religion
and
had
nothing
to
distress
them
but
the
death
of
their
beloved
teacher
poor
moung
quay
was
obliged
to
turn
away
his
face
to
weep
several
times
while
answering
my
inquiries
oh
how
they
feel
the
stroke
that
has
fallen
upon
them
and
well
they
may
for
he
was
to
them
a
father
and
a
guide
the
superintendence
of
the
food
and
clothing
of
both
the
boarding
schools
she
afterwards
writes
together
with
the
care
of
five
under
native
teachers
devolves
wholly
on
me
our
are
growing
every
week
more
and
more
interesting
we
can
not
it
is
true
expect
to
see
among
them
so
much
progress
especially
in
christianity
as
our
boarders
make
but
they
are
constantly
gaining
religious
knowledge
and
will
grow
up
with
comparatively
correct
ideas
they
with
their
teachers
attend
worship
regularly
on
the
are
entirely
supported
at
present
by
the
honorable
allowance

interested

my
dear
sir
mason
has
handed
me
for
perusal
the
extract
from
your
letter
to
government
which
you
kindly
sent
him
i
apprehend
i
have
hitherto
had
wrong
impressions
in
reference
to
the
ground
on
which
the
honorable
company
patronize
schools
in
their
territories
and
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
say
that
it
would
not
accord
with
my
feelings
and
sentiments
to
banish
religious
instruction
from
the
schools
under
my
care
i
think
it
desirable
for
the
rising
generation
of
this
province
to
become
acquainted
with
useful
science
and
the
male
part
of
the
population
with
the
english
language
but
it
is
infinitely
more
important
that
they
receive
into
their
hearts
our
holy
religion
which
is
the
source
of
so
much
happiness
in
this
state
and
imparts
the
hope
of
a
glorious
immortality
in
the
world
to
come
parents
and
guardians
must
know
that
there
is
more
or
less
danger
of
their
children
deserting
the
faith
of
their
ancestors
if
placed
under
the
care
of
a
foreign
missionary
and
the
example
of
some
of
the
pupils
is
calculated
to
increase
such
apprehensions
boardman
baptized
into
the
christian
religion
several
of
his
scholars
one
of
the
number
is
now
a
devoted
preacher
and
notwithstanding
the
decease
of
their
beloved
and
revered
teacher
they
all
with
one
unhappy
exception
remain
firm
in
the
christian
faith
the
success
of
the
hindoo
college
where
religious
instruction
was
interdicted
may
perhaps
be
urged
in
favor
of
pursuing
a
similar
course
in
schools
here
but
it
strikes
me
that
the
case
is
different
here
even
admitting
course
to
be
right
the
overthrow
of
a
system
so
replete
with
cruel
and
impure
rites
as
the
hindoo
or
so
degrading
as
the
mahometan
be
matter
of
joy
though
no
better
religion
were
introduced
in
its
stead
but
the
burman
system
of
morality
is
superior
to
that
of
the
nations
round
them
and
to
the
heathen
of
ancient
times
and
is
surpassed
only
by
the
divine
precepts
of
our
blessed
saviour
like
all
other
merely
institutions
it
is
destitute
of
saving
power
but
its
influence
on
the
people
so
far
as
it
is
felt
is
salutary
and
their
moral
character
will
i
should
think
bear
a
comparison
with
that
of
any
heathen
nation
in
the
world
the
person
who
should
spend
his
days
in
teaching
them
mere
human
science
though
he
might
undermine
their
false
tenets
by
neglecting
to
set
before
them
brighter
hopes
and
purer
principles
would
i
imagine
live
to
very
little
purpose
for
myself
sure
i
am
i
should
at
last
suffer
the
overwhelming
conviction
of
having
labored
in
vain
with
this
view
of
things
you
will
not
my
dear
sir
be
surprised
at
my
saying
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
pursue
a
course
so
utterly
repugnant
to
my
feelings
and
so
contrary
to
my
judgment
as
to
banish
religious
instruction
from
the
schools
in
my
charge
it
is
what
i
am
confident
you
yourself
would
not
wish
but
i
infer
from
a
remark
in
your
letter
that
such
are
the
terms
on
which
government
affords
patronage
it
would
be
wrong
to
deceive
the
patrons
of
the
schools
and
if
my
supposition
is
correct
i
can
do
no
otherwise
than
request
that
the
monthly
allowance
be
withdrawn
it
will
assist
in
establishing
schools
at
maulmain
on
a
plan
more
consonant
with
the
wishes
of
government
than
mine
has
ever
been
meanwhile
i
trust
i
shall
be
able
to
represent
the
claims
of
my
pupils
in
such
a
manner
as
to
obtain
support
and
countenance
from
those
who
would
wish
the
children
to
be
taught
the
principles
of
the
christian
faith
allow
me
my
dear
sir
to
subscribe
myself
yours
most
respectfully
sarah
h
boardman
my
dear
madam
i
can
not
do
otherwise
than
honor
and
respect
the
sentiments
conveyed
in
your
letter
now
received
you
will
i
hope
give
me
credit
for
sincerity
when
i
assure
you
that
in
alluding
to
the
system
of
instruction
pursued
by
you
it
has
ever
been
a
source
of
pride
to
me
to
point
out
the
quiet
way
in
which
your
scholars
have
been
made
acquainted
with
the
christian
religion
my
own
government
in
no
way
proscribes
the
teaching
of
christianity
the
observations
in
my
official
letter
are
intended
to
support
what
i
have
before
brought
to
the
notice
of
government
that
are
received
who
present
themselves
for
instruction
at
your
schools
without
any
stipulation
as
to
their
becoming
members
of
the
christian
faith
i
can
not
express
to
you
how
much
your
letter
has
distressed
me
it
has
been
a
subject
of
consideration
with
me
for
some
months
past
how
i
could
best
succeed
in
establishing
a
college
here
the
scholars
of
which
were
to
have
been
instructed
in
the
same
system
which
you
have
so
successfully
pursued
believe
me
yours
very
faithfully
maingy
appropriations
were
afterward
made
by
the
british
government
for
schools
throughout
the
provinces
to
be
conducted
on
the
plan
of
schools
at
tavoy
and
although
the
propagation
of
christianity
in
the
schools
was
subsequently
prohibited
yet
in
she
always
taught
as
her
conscience
dictated
it
had
been
one
of
boardman
practices
to
make
frequent
tours
among
the
karen
villages
to
preach
the
gospel
and
strengthen
the
disciples
and
the
feeble
churches
even
from
this
duty
as
far
as
the
visitation
was
concerned
his
widow
did
not
shrink
although
she
shrink
from
writing
or
speaking
much
on
the
subject
doubtless
always
regarding
it
as
a
cross
which
although
she
might
bear
with
patience
she
would
willingly
lay
down
as
soon
as
duty
should
permit
attended
by
her
faithful
karens
and
her
little
boy
borne
in
their
arms
leaving
mason
to
his
indispensable
task
of
acquiring
the
language
she
would
thread
the
wild
passes
of
the
mountains
and
the
obscure
paths
of
the
jungle
fording
the
smaller
streams
and
carried
over
the
larger
in
a
chair
borne
on
bamboo
poles
by
her
followers
carrying
joy
and
gladness
to
the
hearts
of
the
villagers
and
cheering
her
own
by
witnessing
their
constancy
and
fidelity
in
her
own
inimitable
style
fanny
forrester
gives
an
account
of
an
adventure
of
boardman
during
one
of
these
excursions
in
which
the
impression
she
made
upon
an
english
officer
who
encountered
her
far
from
civilized
habitations
so
unexpectedly
that
he
almost
mistook
her
for
an
angel
visitant
from
a
better
sphere
was
sufficiently
pleasant
to
form
the
basis
of
a
lasting
friendship
between
them
indeed
there
are
many
testimonials
to
boardman
personal
loveliness
and
grace
of
manner
in
calcutta
where
she
resided
nearly
two
years
she
was
regarded
as
a
finished
lady
and
in
a
tribute
to
her
memory
published
in
the
mother
journal
she
is
described
as
of
about
middle
stature
agreeable
in
personal
appearance
and
winning
in
manners
the
first
impression
of
an
observer
respecting
her
in
her
youth
would
be
of
a
gentle
confiding
persuasive
being
who
would
sweeten
the
cup
of
life
to
those
who
drank
it
with
her
but
further
acquaintance
would
develop
strength
as
well
as
loveliness
of
character
it
would
be
seen
that
she
could
do
and
endure
as
well
as
love
and
please
sweetness
and
strength
gentleness
and
firmness
were
in
her
character
most
happily
blended
her
mind
was
both
poetical
and
practical
she
had
a
refined
taste
and
a
love
for
the
beautiful
as
well
as
the
excellent
but
all
these
fine
gifts
and
endowments
were
consecrated
the
offering
she
had
made
on
her
saviour
altar
was
unreserved
nor
do
we
find
that
she
ever
cast
back
to
the
world
where
she
might
have
shone
so
brilliantly
one
longing
lingering
look
she
is
said
by
her
fellow
missionaries
to
have
made
wonderful
proficiency
in
the
burman
language
and
indeed
she
translated
into
it
bunyan
pilgrim
progress
she
loved
the
language
much
and
used
to
read
the
scriptures
in
it
in
preference
to
reading
them
in
english
she
once
said
to
mason
i
should
be
willing
to
learn
burmese
for
the
sake
of
reading
the
scriptures
in
that
language
the
translation
of
the
scriptures
into
burmese
is
a
work
for
which
burmah
is
indebted
to
judson
for
many
years
this
devoted
servant
of
christ
employed
on
this
great
work
every
moment
he
could
spare
from
pastoral
labor
and
there
is
something
truly
sublime
in
the
record
he
has
left
of
the
completion
of
it
in
his
journal
under
date
of
thanks
be
to
god
i
can
now
say
i
have
attained
i
have
knelt
down
before
him
with
the
last
leaf
in
my
hand
and
imploring
his
forgiveness
for
all
the
sins
which
have
polluted
my
labors
in
this
department
and
his
aid
in
future
efforts
to
remove
the
errors
and
imperfections
which
necessarily
cleave
to
the
work
i
have
commended
it
to
his
mercy
and
grace
i
have
dedicated
it
to
his
glory
may
he
make
his
own
inspired
word
now
complete
in
the
burman
tongue
the
grand
instrument
of
filling
all
burmah
with
songs
and
praises
to
our
great
god
and
saviour

second

to

from
mrs
her
son
sent
to
her
husband
illness
on
the
tenth
of
april
boardman
was
married
to
one
whose
character
she
afterwards
declared
to
be
a
complete
assemblage
of
all
that
woman
could
wish
to
love
and
honor
the
rev
judson
with
him
she
removed
to
her
new
home
in
maulmain
which
had
undergone
wonderful
changes
since
she
left
it
in
then
the
only
church
there
had
native
members
now
she
found
there
three
churches
numbering
two
hundred
members
her
duties
now
were
different
from
what
they
had
been
but
not
less
important
and
in
a
letter
written
to
a
very
intimate
friend
one
year
after
her
marriage
we
find
her
thus
expressing
herself
i
can
truly
say
that
the
mission
cause
and
missionary
labor
is
increasingly
dear
to
me
every
month
of
my
life
i
am
now
united
with
one
whose
heavenly
spirit
and
example
is
deeply
calculated
to
make
me
more
devoted
to
the
cause
than
i
ever
have
been
before
o
that
i
may
profit
by
such
precious
advantages
many
missionaries
had
arrived
from
america
and
established
themselves
in
different
places
several
resided
at
maulmain
so
that
judson
as
we
must
now
call
her
could
enjoy
much
christian
society
besides
that
of
the
natives
but
neither
she
nor
her
had
much
time
to
devote
exclusively
to
social
intercourse
beside
schools
to
superintend
and
to
conduct
and
to
attend
societies
were
to
be
formed
among
the
native
females
in
which
they
could
be
instructed
in
maternal
and
social
duties
in
addition
to
these
cares
judson
took
upon
herself
the
task
of
acquiring
a
new
language
in
order
to
instruct
the
peguans
a
people
who
had
put
themselves
under
the
protection
of
the
british
after
revolting
against
the
burmans
this
people
were
so
numerous
in
maulmain
that
the
missionaries
felt
constrained
to
furnish
them
with
instruction
under
these
labors
judson
health
again
failed
but
after
some
weeks
of
suffering
she
began
to
recover
and
for
many
subsequent
years
her
health
was
uninterrupted
in
a
letter
written
some
time
after
she
accounts
for
her
enjoyment
of
health
in
the
following
manner
when
i
first
came
up
from
tavoy
i
was
thin
and
pale
and
though
i
called
myself
pretty
well
i
had
no
appetite
for
food
and
was
scarce
able
to
walk
half
a
mile
soon
after
i
was
called
to
endure
a
long
and
severe
attack
of
illness
which
brought
me
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
i
was
never
so
low
in
any
former
illness
and
the
doctor
who
attended
me
has
since
told
me
that
he
had
no
hope
of
my
recovery
and
that
when
he
came
to
prescribe
medicine
for
me
it
was
more
out
of
regard
to
the
feelings
of
my
husband
than
from
any
prospect
of
its
affording
me
relief
i
lay
confined
to
my
bed
week
after
week
unable
to
move
except
as
judson
sometimes
carried
me
in
his
arms
from
the
bed
to
the
couch
for
a
change
and
even
this
once
brought
on
a
return
of
the
disease
which
very
nearly
cost
me
my
life
i
never
shall
forget
the
precious
seasons
enjoyed
on
that
sick
bed
little
george
will
tell
you
about
it
if
you
should
ever
see
him
i
think
he
will
always
remember
some
sweet
conversations
i
had
with
him
on
the
state
of
his
soul
at
that
time
dear
child
his
mind
was
very
tender
and
he
would
weep
on
account
of
his
sins
and
would
kneel
down
and
pray
with
all
the
fervor
and
simplicity
of
childhood
he
used
to
read
the
bible
to
me
every
day
and
commit
little
hymns
to
memory
by
my
bedside
it
pleased
my
heavenly
father
to
raise
me
up
again
although
i
was
for
a
long
time
very
weak
as
soon
as
i
was
able
i
commenced
riding
on
horseback
and
used
to
take
a
long
ride
every
morning
before
sunrise
after
a
patient
trial
i
found
that
riding
improved
my
health
though
many
times
i
should
have
become
discouraged
and
given
it
up
but
for
the
perseverance
of
my
husband
after
riding
almost
every
day
for
four
or
five
months
i
found
my
health
so
much
improved
and
gained
strength
so
fast
that
i
began
to
think
walking
might
be
substituted
about
this
time
my
nice
little
pony
died
and
we
commenced
a
regular
system
of
exercise
on
foot
walking
at
a
rapid
pace
far
over
the
hills
beyond
the
town
before
the
sun
was
up
every
morning
we
have
continued
this
perseveringly
up
to
the
present
time
and
during
these
years
my
health
has
been
better
than
at
any
time
previous
since
my
arrival
in
india
and
my
constitution
seems
to
have
undergone
an
entire
renovation
in
burmah
proper
that
is
that
part
of
burmah
not
under
british
government
the
native
christians
enjoyed
no
toleration
from
the
government
and
often
suffered
bitterly
but
in
maulmain
and
other
places
in
british
burmah
religion
flourished
and
converts
were
multiplied
vinton
a
new
missionary
preached
with
great
power
in
the
karen
churches
and
that
people
says
judson
flocked
into
the
kingdom
by
scores
judson
was
revising
his
translation
of
the
bible
a
task
of
five
years
duration
and
preaching
to
the
burmese
church
while
instructed
in
the
schools
and
translated
into
peguan
such
tracts
as
were
thought
most
calculated
to
acquaint
that
people
with
christian
doctrine
she
afterwards
translated
into
that
language
the
new
testament
and
the
life
of
christ
but
on
the
arrival
of
haswell
she
gave
up
to
him
all
her
books
and
papers
in
this
language
and
only
attended
to
it
in
future
so
far
as
to
assist
him
in
his
studies
of
the
severest
trial
to
which
judson
was
called
during
the
remainder
of
her
life
she
gives
an
account
in
the
following
eloquent
words
after
deliberation
accompanied
with
tears
and
agony
and
prayers
i
came
to
the
conviction
that
it
was
my
duty
to
send
away
my
only
child
my
darling
george
and
yesterday
he
bade
me
a
long
farewell
oh
i
shall
never
forget
his
looks
as
he
stood
by
the
door
and
gazed
at
me
for
the
last
time
his
eyes
were
filling
with
tears
and
his
little
face
red
with
suppressed
emotion
but
he
subdued
his
feelings
and
it
was
not
till
he
had
turned
away
and
was
going
down
the
steps
that
he
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
i
hurried
to
my
room
and
on
my
knees
with
my
whole
heart
gave
him
up
to
god
and
my
bursting
heart
was
comforted
from
above
my
reason
and
judgment
tell
me
that
the
good
of
my
child
requires
that
he
should
be
sent
to
america
and
this
of
itself
would
support
me
in
some
little
degree
but
when
i
view
it
as
a
made
for
the
sake
of
jesus
it
becomes
a
delightful
privilege
i
can
not
but
hope
he
will
one
day
return
to
burmah
a
missionary
of
the
cross
as
his
dear
father
was
this
is
in
some
respects
the
severest
trial
i
ever
met
with
it
would
be
delightful
to
accompany
the
dear
boy
in
his
perilous
journey
to
the
and
to
transcribe
the
yearning
and
affectionate
letters
of
his
mother
both
to
him
and
to
those
to
whose
charge
he
was
entrusted
they
could
not
but
heighten
our
opinion
of
her
excellence
in
the
maternal
relation
as
well
as
of
the
great
sensibility
of
her
heart
but
we
are
warned
that
our
pages
are
swelling
to
too
great
a
number
ours
is
but
a
sketch
an
outline
those
who
would
see
the
full
length
portrait
of
our
heroine
must
consult
the
glowing
canvass
of
her
biographer
and
successor
fanny
forrester
her
next
trial
was
to
see
her
beloved
husband
suffering
with
a
severe
cough
which
she
feared
would
end
in
pulmonary
consumption
to
avert
this
dreaded
result
he
was
obliged
to
leave
her
and
try
a
long
the
account
of
their
parting
and
her
touching
letters
during
his
absence
would
greatly
enrich
our
little
sketch
had
we
room
to
copy
them
we
find
a
place
for
one
short
extract
from
the
letters
your
little
daughter
and
i
have
been
praying
for
you
this
evening
at
times
the
sweet
hope
that
you
will
soon
return
restored
to
perfect
health
buoys
up
my
spirit
but
perhaps
you
will
find
it
necessary
to
go
farther
a
necessity
from
which
i
can
not
but
shrink
with
doubt
and
dread
or
you
may
come
back
only
to
die
with
me
this
last
agonizing
thought
crushes
me
down
in
overwhelming
sorrow
i
hope
i
do
not
feel
unwilling
that
our
heavenly
father
should
do
as
he
thinks
best
with
us
but
my
heart
shrinks
from
the
prospect
of
living
in
this
dark
sinful
friendless
world
without
you
but
the
most
satisfactory
view
is
to
look
away
to
that
blissful
world
where
separations
are
unknown
there
my
beloved
judson
we
shall
meet
each
other
and
we
shall
also
meet
many
loved
ones
who
have
gone
before
us
to
that
haven
of
rest
her
fears
were
not
realized
in
a
few
months
judson
was
restored
to
her
and
the
suffering
mission
cause
in
greatly
improved
health
chapter
xv
illness
of
her
death
of
one
of
her
missionary
labors
and
family
her
declining
her
last
illness
and
death
the
seventh
year
of
her
marriage
with
judson
was
a
year
of
peculiar
trial
to
j
all
her
four
children
were
attacked
by
followed
by
one
of
the
diseases
of
the
climate
with
which
she
also
was
so
violently
afflicted
that
her
life
was
for
a
time
despaired
of
she
felt
sure
as
she
afterwards
said
that
her
hour
of
release
was
come
that
her
master
was
calling
her
and
she
blessed
god
that
she
was
entirely
willing
to
leave
all
and
go
to
him
the
only
hope
of
recovery
for
any
of
them
was
a
and
they
embarked
for
bengal
but
their
passage
was
stormy
and
they
derived
little
benefit
from
their
stay
at
serampore
where
they
had
taken
up
their
residence
a
voyage
to
the
mauritius
was
recommended
and
the
alarming
situation
of
three
of
the
children
as
well
as
judson
feeble
state
determined
them
to
try
it
but
before
they
embarked
it
was
her
melancholy
lot
to
lay
one
of
her
darlings
in
the
grave
and
he
the
very
one
about
whose
health
she
had
felt
the
least
uneasiness
he
sleeps
says
his
mother
in
the
mission
where
moulders
the
dust
of
carey
marshman
and
ward
her
tears
at
his
burial
flowed
not
only
for
him
that
was
dead
but
for
another
who
she
expected
would
soon
follow
him
to
avert
this
calamity
she
hastened
her
voyage
which
though
fearfully
tempestuous
proved
beneficial
to
the
sufferers
and
after
a
short
sojourn
in
the
soft
climate
of
the
isle
of
france
the
family
returned
to
their
home
in
maulmain
restored
with
the
exception
of
one
son
to
sound
health
this
son
who
bore
the
name
of
his
father
was
called
by
the
natives
pwen
which
signifies
a
flower
a
name
adopted
by
his
parents
after
a
long
illness
he
too
was
restored
to
health
judson
labors
during
the
latter
part
of
her
life
are
recorded
by
her
husband
and
it
may
well
excite
the
wonder
of
those
women
who
consider
the
care
of
their
own
families
a
sufficient
task
that
she
could
find
time
and
strength
for
such
an
amount
of
labor
it
has
been
said
that
her
translation
of
bunyan
pilgrim
progress
is
a
work
worth
living
for
her
husband
says
it
is
one
of
the
best
pieces
of
composition
we
have
published
she
also
translated
a
tract
written
by
her
husband
edited
a
chapel
hymn
book
and
furnished
for
it
twenty
of
its
best
hymns
and
published
four
volumes
of
scripture
questions
for
use
in
the
sabbath
schools
when
we
consider
that
she
was
the
mother
of
a
rapidly
increasing
family
and
the
head
of
an
establishment
which
like
all
in
the
east
require
constant
and
vigilant
superintendence
and
that
she
was
exemplary
in
the
discharge
of
her
maternal
and
domestic
duties
we
are
led
to
fancy
she
must
have
possessed
some
secret
charm
by
which
she
could
stay
the
hurrying
feet
of
time
and
hold
the
fleet
angel
fast
until
he
blessed
her
such
a
secret
was
her
untiring
zeal
which
prompted
an
incessant
industry
the
sands
of
time
are
indeed
numerous
and
when
each
is
valued
as
a
sparkling
treasure
they
form
a
rich
hoard
laid
up
where
neither
moth
nor
rust
corrupt
but
if
we
let
them
escape
unheeded
or
sit
and
idly
watch
their
flow
and
even
shake
the
glass
to
hasten
it
they
will
gather
into
a
millstone
weight
to
sink
us
in
endless
unavailing
regret
though
she
is
dead
works
still
live
and
generation
after
generation
of
burmans
will
associate
her
name
with
that
of
her
honored
husband
as
benefactors
to
their
race
in
december
the
health
of
judson
began
to
decline
her
anxious
husband
determined
to
leave
no
means
untried
to
save
a
life
so
precious
to
the
mission
and
so
invaluable
to
himself
and
his
family
decided
to
quit
for
a
while
his
loved
labors
in
burmah
and
accompany
his
wife
to
america
they
in
may
sailed
and
on
reaching
the
isle
of
france
she
found
herself
so
far
restored
that
she
could
no
longer
conscientiously
detain
her
husband
from
his
duties
in
india
and
she
resolved
to
let
him
go
back
to
their
home
there
while
she
with
her
children
should
complete
the
journey
that
still
seemed
necessary
for
her
entire
restoration
one
of
the
sweetest
of
her
poems
was
occasioned
by
this
resolution
we
part
on
this
green
islet
love
thou
for
the
eastern
main
i
for
the
setting
sun
love
oh
when
to
meet
again
my
heart
is
sad
for
thee
love
for
lone
thy
way
will
be
and
oft
thy
tears
will
fall
love
for
thy
children
and
for
me
the
music
of
thy
daughter
voice
miss
for
many
a
year
and
the
merry
shout
of
thine
elder
boys
list
in
vain
to
hear
when
we
knelt
to
see
our
henry
die
and
heard
his
last
faint
moan
each
wiped
the
tear
from
other
eye
now
each
must
weep
alone
my
tears
fall
fast
for
thee
love
how
can
i
say
farewell
but
go
thy
god
be
with
thee
love
thy
heart
deep
grief
to
quell
yet
my
spirit
clings
to
thine
love
thy
soul
remains
with
me
and
oft
we
hold
communion
sweet
the
dark
and
distant
sea
and
who
can
paint
our
mutual
joy
when
all
our
wanderings
we
both
shall
clasp
our
infants
three
at
home
on
burmah
shore
but
higher
shall
our
raptures
glow
on
yon
celestial
plain
when
the
loved
and
parted
here
below
meet
to
part
again
then
gird
thine
armor
on
love
nor
faint
thou
by
the
way
till
boodh
shall
fall
and
burmah
sons
shall
own
messiah
sway
but
her
health
still
sinking
her
husband
could
not
leave
her
and
she
was
borne
back
to
the
ship
her
life
ebbed
away
so
rapidly
that
he
feared
he
must
consign
her
to
an
ocean
grave
but
a
kind
providence
ordered
it
that
her
death
did
not
occur
till
the
ship
anchored
at
helena
her
end
was
as
peaceful
as
her
life
had
been
consistent
and
exemplary
no
shade
of
doubt
or
fear
or
anxiety
crossed
her
mind
so
writes
her
husband
she
had
a
prevailing
preference
to
depart
and
be
with
christ
i
am
longing
to
depart
she
would
say
and
then
the
thought
of
her
dear
native
land
to
which
she
was
approaching
after
an
absence
of
twenty
years
and
a
longing
desire
to
see
her
son
george
her
parents
and
the
friends
of
her
youth
would
draw
down
her
ascending
soul
and
constrain
her
to
say
am
in
a
strait
betwixt
two
the
will
of
the
lord
be
done
in
regard
to
her
children
she
ever
manifested
the
most
surprising
composure
and
resignation
so
much
so
that
i
was
once
constrained
to
say
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
the
dear
little
ones
we
have
left
behind
a
mother
forget
she
replied
and
was
unable
to
proceed
during
her
last
days
she
spent
much
time
in
praying
for
the
early
conversion
of
her
children
on
the
evening
of
the
of
august
i
sat
alone
by
the
side
of
her
bed
endeavoring
to
administer
relief
to
the
distressed
body
and
consolation
to
the
departing
soul
at
two
in
the
morning
wishing
to
obtain
one
more
token
of
recognition
i
roused
her
attention
and
said
you
still
love
the
saviour
yes
she
replied
ever
love
the
lord
jesus
christ
i
said
again
you
still
love
me
she
replied
in
the
affirmative
by
a
peculiar
expression
of
her
own
give
me
one
more
kiss
and
we
exchanged
that
token
of
love
for
the
last
time
another
hour
passed
and
she
ceased
to
breathe
so
fades
the
summer
cloud
away
so
sinks
the
gale
when
storms
are
so
gently
shuts

indeed
make
it
more
interesting
by
incidents
and
anecdotes
drawn
from
those
of
her
early
associates
who
love
to
dwell
on
the
rich
promise
of
her
childhood
and
youth
but
by
doing
so
we
should
incur
the
risk
of
intruding
on
the
sacredness
of
the
family
circle
and
we
forbear
she
was
born
in
eaton
a
town
near
the
centre
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
her
childhood
she
exhibited
an
exuberance
of
imagination
that
enabled
her
to
delight
her
young
associates
with
tales
which
according
to
one
of
them
she
would
sit
up
in
bed
in
the
morning
to
write
and
then
read
aloud
to
them
she
would
even
then
write
verses
also
but
in
this
gift
she
was
perhaps
inferior
to
a
sister
who
died
in
early
life
and
whose
numerous
poems
were
unfortunately
and
to
the
grief
of
her
family
accidentally
lost
at
an
early
period
she
embraced
religion
and
was
baptized
by
the
rev
dean
a
missionary
to
china
then
in
this
country
her
interest
was
awakened
in
the
heathen
even
at
that
time
and
she
indulged
in
many
ardent
longings
to
go
as
a
missionary
to
them
the
late
kendrick
judiciously
advised
her
to
pursue
the
path
of
duty
at
home
and
quietly
wait
the
leadings
and
openings
of
providence
this
advice
she
followed
and
as
a
means
of
improving
the
straitened
circumstances
of
her
family
she
left
home
and
engaged
as
a
teacher
in
a
seminary
in
utica
desirous
to
increase
still
farther
her
mother
limited
resources
she
determined
to
employ
her
pen
and
published
some
short
religious
tales
which
however
brought
her
little
fame
and
small
pecuniary
emolument
but
in
by
a
skilful
and
happy
letter
to
the
conductor
of
the
york
she
so
attracted
the
attention
of
the
fastidious
and
brilliant
editor
of
that
magazine
that
he
engaged
her
as
a
constant
contributor
this
arrangement
though
of
great
pecuniary
advantage
was
in
a
religious
view
a
snare
to
her
as
a
writer
of
light
graceful
stories
of
a
purely
worldly
character
she
had
in
this
country
few
rivals
and
her
name
attached
to
a
tale
or
a
poem
became
a
passport
to
popular
favor
in
a
letter
to
her
aged
pastor
written
a
year
after
her
marriage
she
laments
her
extreme
worldliness
at
that
period
which
she
says
even
led
her
to
be
ashamed
of
her
former
desire
to
be
a
missionary
yet
her
writings
are
marked
by
purity
and
generally
inculcated
nothing
unfriendly
either
to
virtue
or
religion
but
it
was
the
religion
of
sentiment
and
the
virtue
of
the
natural
heart
of
which
it
must
be
confessed
we
find
far
more
in
fictitious
tales
than
in
real
life
when
we
consider
the
nobleness
of
the
motive
that
led
her
to
seek
a
popular
path
to
favor
and
emolument
to
increase
the
comforts
of
her
excellent
and
honored
mother
our
censure
were
we
disposed
to
indulge
any
is
disarmed
and
almost
changed
to
admiration
during
judson
visit
to
america
in
while
riding
in
a
public
conveyance
with
who
was
escorting
him
to
his
home
in
philadelphia
a
story
written
by
fanny
forrester
fell
into
the
hands
of
j
he
read
it
with
satisfaction
remarking
that
he
should
like
to
know
its
author
you
will
soon
have
that
pleasure
said
for
she
is
now
visiting
at
my
house
an
acquaintance
then
commenced
between
them
which
notwithstanding
the
disparity
in
their
years
soon
ripened
into
a
warm
attachment
and
after
a
severe
struggle
she
broke
as
she
says
the
innumerable
ties
that
bound
her
to
the
fascinating
worldly
life
she
had
adopted
and
consented
to
become
what
in
her
early
religious
zeal
she
had
so
longed
to
be
a
missionary
and
now
the
spell
of
worldliness
was
indeed
broken
with
mingled
shame
and
penitence
she
reviewed
her
spiritual
declensions
and
with
an
humbled
spirit
renewed
her
neglected
covenant
with
the
god
and
guide
of
her
youth
in
judson
to
whom
she
was
married
on
the
of
june
she
found
a
wise
and
faithful
friend
and
counsellor
as
well
as
a
devoted
husband
in
his
tried
and
experienced
piety
she
gained
the
support
and
encouragement
she
needed
in
her
christian
life
conscious
that
she
had
given
to
the
world
service
too
many
of
her
noble
gifts
she
commenced
a
work
of
an
exclusively
religious
character
and
tendency
the
biography
of
her
predecessor
the
second
judson
in
one
year
it
was
completed
and
in
speaking
of
it
in
a
letter
from
india
whither
she
had
accompanied
immediately
after
their
marriage
she
playfully
remarked
that
her
husband
was
pleased
with
it
and
she
cared
little
whether
any
one
else
liked
it
or
not
on
her
passage
to
india
judson
passed
in
sight
of
that
island
which
must
ever
attract
the
gaze
of
men
of
every
clime
and
nation
the
rocky
prison
and
tomb
of
the
conqueror
of
nations
napoleon
bonaparte
but
to
her
the
island
had
more
tender
associations
awakened
more
touching
recollections
it
was
as
the
grave
of
sarah
judson
that
her
successor
gazed
long
and
tearfully
on
the
isle
of
helena
and
she
thus
embodied
her
feelings
in
song

lines

pen
in
consoling
those
on
whom
had
fallen
the
stroke
of
bereavement
lines
to
a
missionary
friend
in
burmah
on
the
death
of
her
little
boy
thirteen
months
old
in
which
allusion
is
made
to
the
previous
death
of
his
little
a
mound

in
the
graveyard
a
short
and
narrow
bed

it
and
no
marble

but
ye

no

mouldering
dead
but
in

mansion
upon

breast
with
his

setting

the
following
letter
and
beautiful
poems
need
little
explanation
the
letter
is
addressed
to
some
of
judson
children
who
resided
in
worcester
massachusetts
having
been
sent
home
from
india
to
be
educated
in
america
his
health
having
failed
had
sailed
for
the
isle
of
bourbon
for
its
restoration
and
it
was
during
his
absence
that
these
effusions
were
penned
maulmain
april
my
very
dear
children
i
have
painful
news
to
tell
you
news
that
i
am
sure
will
make
your
hearts
ache
but
i
hope
our
heavenly
father
will
help
you
to
bear
it
your
dear
papa
is
very
very
ill
indeed
so
much
so
that
the
best
judges
fear
that
he
will
never
be
any
better
he
began
to
fail
about
five
months
ago
and
has
declined
so
gradually
that
we
were
not
fully
aware
of
his
danger
until
lately
but
within
a
few
weeks
those
who
love
him
have
become
very
much
alarmed
in
january
we
went
down
to
mergui
by
the
steamer
and
when
we
returned
thought
he
was
a
little
better
but
he
soon
failed
again
we
spent
a
month
at
amherst
but
he
received
little
if
any
benefit
next
the
doctors
pronounced
our
house
the
one
you
used
to
live
in
unhealthy
and
we
moved
to
another
but
all
was
of
no
use
your
dear
papa
continued
to
fail
till
suddenly
one
evening
his
muscular
strength
gave
way
and
he
was
prostrated
on
the
bed
unable
to
help
himself
this
occurred
about
two
weeks
ago
the
doctor
now
became
alarmed
and
said
the
only
hope
for
him
was
in
a
long
voyage
it
was
very
hard
to
think
of
such
a
thing
in
his
reduced
state
particularly
as
i
could
not
go
with
him
but
after
we
had
wept
and
prayed
over
it
one
day
and
night
we
concluded
that
it
was
our
duty
to
use
the
only
means
which
god
had
left
us
however
painful
we
immediately
engaged
his
passage
on
board
a
french
barque
bound
for
the
isle
of
bourbon
but
before
it
sailed
he
had
become
so
very
low
that
no
one
thought
it
right
for
him
to
go
alone
they
therefore
called
a
meeting
of
the
mission
and
appointed
ranney
it
was
a
great
relief
to
me
for
he
is
a
very
kind
man
and
loves
your
dear
papa
very
much
and
he
will
do
everything
that
can
be
done
for
his
comfort
the
officers
of
the
vessel
too
seemed
greatly
interested
for
him
as
did
every
one
else
he
was
carried
on
board
a
week
ago
yesterday
in
a
litter
and
placed
on
a
nice
easy
cot
made
purposely
for
him
i
stayed
with
him
all
day
and
at
dark
came
home
to
stay
with
the
children
the
next
day
found
that
the
vessel
had
only
dropped
down
a
little
distance
and
so
i
took
a
boat
and
followed
i
expected
this
would
certainly
be
the
last
day
with
him
but
it
was
not
on
friday
i
went
again
and
though
he
did
not
appear
as
well
as
on
the
previous
days
i
was
forced
to
take
as
i
then
supposed
a
final
leave
of
him
but
when
morning
came
i
felt
as
though
i
could
not
live
through
the
day
without
knowing
how
he
was
so
i
took
a
boat
again
and
reached
the
vessel
about
he
could
only
speak
in
whispers
but
seemed
very
glad
that
i
came
the
natives
i
had
sent
to
fan
him
till
he
should
get
out
of
the
river
came
to
me
and
begged
to
have
him
taken
on
shore
again
and
so
small
was
my
hope
of
his
recovery
that
my
heart
pleaded
on
their
side
though
i
still
thought
it
a
duty
to
do
as
the
doctor
had
ordered
i
came
away
at
dark
and
though
his
lips
moved
to
say
some
word
of
farewell
they
made
no
sound
i
hope
that
you
my
dear
boys
will
never
have
cause
to
know
what
a
heavy
heart
i
bore
back
to
my
desolate
home
that
night
the
vessel
got
out
to
sea
about
on
monday
and
last
night
the
natives
returned
bringing
a
letter
from
ranney
your
precious
papa
has
revived
again
spoke
aloud
took
a
little
tea
and
toast
said
there
was
something
animating
in
the
touch
of
the
sea
breeze
and
directed
ranney
to
write
to
me
that
he
had
a
strong
belief
it
was
the
will
of
god
to
restore
him
again
to
health
i
feel
somewhat
encouraged
but
dare
not
hope
too
much
and
now
my
dear
boys
it
will
be
three
perhaps
four
long
months
before
we
can
hear
from
our
beloved
one
again
and
we
shall
all
be
very
anxious
all
we
can
do
is
to
commit
him
to
the
care
of
our
heavenly
father
and
if
we
never
see
him
again
in
this
world
pray
that
we
may
be
prepared
to
meet
him
in
heaven
your
most
affectionate
mother
emily
judson
prayer
for
dear
papa
poor
and
needy
little
children
saviour
god
we
come
to
thee
for
our
hearts
are
full
of
sorrow
and
no
other
hope
have
we
out
upon
the
restless
ocean
there
is
one
we
dearly
love
fold
him
in
thine
arms
of
pity
spread
thy
guardian
wings
above
when
the
winds
are
howling
round
him
when
the
angry
waves
are
high
when
black
heavy
midnight
shadows
on
his
trackless
pathway
lie
guide
and
guard
him
blessed
saviour
bid
the
hurrying
tempests
stay
plant
thy
foot
upon
the
waters
send
thy
smile
to
light
his
way
when
he
lies
all
pale
and
suffering
stretched
upon
his
narrow
bed
with
no
loving
face
bent
him
no
soft
hand
about
his
head
o
let
kind
and
pitying
angels
their
bright
forms
around
him
bow
let
them
kiss
his
heavy
eyelids
let
them
fan
his
fevered
brow
poor
and
needy
little
children
still
we
raise
our
cry
to
thee
we
have
nestled
in
his
bosom
we
have
sported
on
his
knee
dearly
dearly
do
we
love
him
we
who
on
his
breast
have
lain
pity
now
our
desolation
bring
him
back
to
us
again
if
it
please
thee
heavenly
father
we
would
see
him
come
once
more
with
his
olden
step
of
vigor
with
the
smile
he
wore
but
if
we
must
tread
life
valley
orphaned
guideless
and
alone
let
us
lose
not
the
shadows
his
dear
footprints
to
thy
throne
april
sweet
mother
the
wild
monsoon
has
risen
with
broad
gray
wings
of
gloom
while
here
from
out
my
dreary
prison
i
look
as
from
a
tomb
alas
my
heart
another
tomb
upon
the
roof
the
rain
with
ceaseless
patter
falls
my
choicest
treasures

its
stain

gathers
on

in
pain
the
sunshine
from
my
heart
has
flown
it
feels
the
driving
rain
ah
me
the
chill
and
mould
and
rain
four
laggard
months
have
wheeled
their
round
since
love
upon
it
smiled
and
everything
of
earth
has
frowned
on
thy
poor
stricken
child
sweet
friend
thy
weary
suffering
child
i
watched
my
loved
one
night
and
day
scarce
breathing
when
he
slept
and
as
my
hopes
were
swept
away
i
on
his
bosom
wept
o
god
how
had
i
prayed
and
wept
they
bore
him
from
me
to
the
ship
as
bearers
bear
the
dead
i
kissed
his
speechless
quivering
lip
and
left
him
on
his
bed
alas
it
seemed
a
when
from
my
gentle
sister
tomb
in
all
our
grief
we
came
rememberest
thou
her
vacant
room
well
his
was
just
the
same
that
day
the
very
very
same
then
mother
little
charley
came
our
beautiful
fair
boy
with
my
own
father
cherished
name
but
oh
he
brought
no
joy
my
child
brought
mourning
and
no
joy
his
little
grave
i
can
not
see
though
weary
months
have
sped
since
pitying
lips
bent
over
me
and
whispered
he
is
dead
alas
is
dreadful
to
be
dead
i
do
not
mean
for
one
like
me
so
weary
worn
and
weak
death
shadowy
paleness
seems
to
be
even
now
upon
my
cheek
his
seal
on
form
and
brow
and
cheek
but
for
a
bird
like
him
to
hush
his
joyous
song
and
prisoned
in
a
coffin
dim
join
death
pale
phantom
throng
to
join
that
grisly
throng
oh
mother
i
can
scarcely
bear
to
think
of
this
it
was
so
exquisitely
fair
that
little
form
of
clay
my
heart
still
lingers
by
his
clay
and
when
for
one
loved
far
far
more
come
thickly
gathering
tears
my
star
of
faith
is
clouded
i
sink
beneath
my
fears
sweet
friend
my
heavy
weight
of
fears
oh
should
he
not
return
to
me
drear
drear
must
be
life
night
and
mother
i
can
almost
see
even
now
the
gathering
blight
my
soul
faints
stricken
by
the
blight
oh
but
to
feel
thy
fond
arms
twine
around
me
once
again
it
almost
seems
those
lips
of
thine
might
kiss
away
the
pain
might
soothe
this
dull
cold
heavy
pain
but
gentle
mother
through
life
storms
i
may
not
lean
on
thee
for
helpless
cowering
little
forms
cling
trustingly
to
me
poor
babes
to
have
no
guide
but
me
with
weary
foot
and
broken
wing
with
bleeding
heart
and
sore
thy
dove
looks
backward
sorrowing
but
seeks
the
ark
no
more
thy
breast
seeks
never
never
more
sweet
mother
for
this
wanderer
pray
that
loftier
faith
be
given
her
broken
reeds
all
swept
away
that
she
may
lean
on
heaven
her
soul
grow
strong
on
christ
and
heaven
all
fearfully
all
tearfully
alone
and
sorrowing
my
dim
eye
lifted
to
the
sky
fast
to
the
cross
i
cling
o
christ
to
thy
dear
cross
i
cling
august
from
the
sad
voyage
which
drew
forth
this
most
touching
poem
judson
never
returned
he
died
on
board
the
ship
which
was
bearing
him
to
more
healthful
climes
and
his
body
was
committed
to
the
ocean
one
of
the
most
excellent
of
judson
productions
is
her
account
of
the
closing
scenes
in
her
husband
life
contained
in
a
letter
to
his
sister
long
as
it
is
we
can
not
bring
ourselves
to
abridge
it
it
will
convince
our
readers
that
if
the
three
whose
lives
we
have
sketched
have
been
among
the
first
of
women
they
were
united
to
one
who
knew
and
appreciated
their
excellence
and
who
was
to
share
their
affection
closing
scenes
in
the
life
of
judson
by
his
widow
last
month
i
could
do
no
more
than
announce
to
you
our
painful
bereavement
which
though
not
altogether
unexpected
will
i
very
well
know
fall
upon
your
heart
with
overwhelming
weight
you
will
find
the
account
of
your
brother
last
days
on
board
the
aristide
marie
in
a
letter
written
by
ranney
from
mauritius
to
the
secretary
of
the
board
and
i
can
add
nothing
to
it
with
the
exception
of
a
few
unimportant
particulars
gleaned
in
conversation
with
and
the
coringa
servant
i
grieve
that
it
should
be
so
that
i
was
not
permitted
to
watch
beside
him
during
those
days
of
terrible
suffering
but
the
pain
which
i
at
first
felt
is
gradually
yielding
to
gratitude
for
the
inestimable
privileges
which
had
previously
been
granted
me
there
was
something
exceedingly
beautiful
in
the
decline
of
your
brother
life
more
beautiful
than
i
can
describe
though
the
impression
will
remain
with
me
as
a
sacred
legacy
until
i
go
to
meet
him
where
suns
shall
never
set
and
life
shall
never
end
he
had
been
from
my
first
acquaintance
with
him
an
uncommonly
spiritual
christian
exhibiting
his
richest
graces
in
the
unguarded
intercourse
of
private
life
but
during
his
last
year
it
seemed
as
though
the
light
of
the
world
on
which
he
was
entering
had
been
sent
to
brighten
his
upward
pathway
every
subject
on
which
we
conversed
every
book
we
read
every
incident
that
occurred
whether
trivial
or
important
had
a
tendency
to
suggest
some
peculiarly
spiritual
train
of
thought
till
it
seemed
to
me
that
more
than
ever
before
christ
was
all
his
theme
something
of
the
same
nature
was
also
noted
in
his
preaching
to
which
i
then
had
not
the
privilege
of
listening
he
was
in
the
habit
however
of
studying
his
subject
for
the
sabbath
audibly
and
in
my
presence
at
which
time
he
was
frequently
so
much
affected
as
to
weep
and
some
times
so
overwhelmed
with
the
vastness
of
his
conceptions
as
to
be
obliged
to
abandon
his
theme
and
choose
another
my
own
illness
at
the
commencement
of
the
year
had
brought
eternity
very
near
to
us
and
rendered
death
the
grave
and
the
bright
heaven
beyond
it
familiar
subjects
of
conversation
gladly
would
i
give
you
my
dear
sister
some
idea
of
the
share
borne
by
him
in
those
memorable
conversations
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
convey
even
to
those
who
knew
him
best
the
most
distant
conception
i
believe
he
has
sometimes
been
thought
eloquent
both
in
conversation
and
in
the
sacred
desk
but
the
fervid
burning
eloquence
the
deep
pathos
the
touching
tenderness
the
elevation
of
thought
and
intense
beauty
of
expression
which
characterized
those
private
teachings
were
not
only
beyond
what
i
had
ever
heard
before
but
such
as
i
felt
sure
arrested
his
own
attention
and
surprised
even
himself
about
this
time
he
began
to
find
unusual
satisfaction
and
enjoyment
in
his
private
devotions
and
seemed
to
have
few
objects
of
interest
continually
rising
in
his
mind
each
of
which
in
turn
became
special
subjects
of
prayer
among
these
one
of
the
most
prominent
was
the
conversion
of
his
posterity
he
remarked
that
he
had
always
prayed
for
his
children
but
that
of
late
he
had
felt
impressed
with
the
duty
of
praying
for
their
children
and
their
children
children
down
to
the
latest
generation
he
also
prayed
most
fervently
that
his
impressions
on
this
particular
subject
might
be
transferred
to
his
sons
and
daughters
and
thence
to
their
offspring
so
that
he
should
ultimately
meet
a
long
unbroken
line
of
descendants
before
the
throne
of
god
where
all
might
join
together
in
ascribing
everlasting
praises
to
their
redeemer
another
subject
which
occupied
a
large
share
of
his
attention
was
that
of
brotherly
love
you
are
perhaps
aware
that
like
all
persons
of
his
ardent
temperament
he
was
subject
to
strong
attachments
and
aversions
which
he
sometimes
had
difficulty
in
bringing
under
the
controlling
influence
of
divine
grace
he
remarked
that
he
had
always
felt
more
or
less
of
an
affectionate
interest
in
his
brethren
as
brethren
and
some
of
them
he
had
loved
very
dearly
for
their
personal
qualities
but
that
he
was
now
aware
he
had
never
placed
his
standard
of
love
high
enough
he
spoke
of
them
as
children
of
god
redeemed
by
the
saviour
blood
watched
over
and
guarded
by
his
love
dear
to
his
heart
honored
by
him
in
the
election
and
to
be
honored
hereafter
before
the
assembled
universe
and
he
said
it
was
not
sufficient
to
be
kind
and
obliging
to
such
to
abstain
from
evil
speaking
and
make
a
general
mention
of
them
in
our
prayers
but
our
attachment
to
them
should
be
of
the
race
ardent
and
exalted
character
it
would
be
so
in
heaven
and
we
lost
immeasurably
by
not
beginning
now
as
i
have
loved
you
so
ought
ye
also
to
love
one
another
was
a
precept
continually
in
his
mind
and
he
would
often
murmur
as
though
unconsciously
i
have
loved
you
i
have
loved
you
then
burst
out
with
the
exclamation
oh
the
love
of
christ
the
love
of
christ
his
prayers
for
the
mission
were
marked
by
an
earnest
grateful
enthusiasm
and
in
speaking
of
missionary
operations
in
general
his
tone
was
one
of
elevated
triumph
almost
of
exultation
for
he
not
only
felt
an
unshaken
confidence
in
their
final
success
but
would
often
exclaim
what
wonders
oh
what
wonders
god
has
already
wrought
i
remarked
that
during
this
year
his
literary
labor
which
he
had
never
liked
and
upon
which
he
had
entered
unwillingly
and
from
a
feeling
of
necessity
was
growing
daily
more
irksome
to
him
and
he
always
spoke
of
it
as
his
heavy
work
his
tedious
work
that
wearisome
dictionary
though
this
feeling
led
to
no
relaxation
of
effort
he
longed
however
to
find
some
more
spiritual
employment
to
be
engaged
in
what
he
considered
more
legitimate
missionary
labor
and
drew
delightful
pictures
of
the
future
when
his
whole
business
would
be
but
to
preach
and
to
pray
during
all
this
time
i
had
not
observed
any
failure
in
physical
strength
and
though
his
mental
exercises
occupied
a
large
share
of
my
thoughts
when
alone
it
never
once
occurred
to
me
that
this
might
be
the
brightening
of
the
setting
sun
my
only
feeling
was
that
of
pleasure
that
one
so
near
to
me
was
becoming
so
pure
and
elevated
in
his
sentiments
and
so
lovely
and
in
his
character
in
person
he
had
grown
somewhat
stouter
than
when
in
america
his
complexion
had
a
healthful
hue
compared
with
that
of
his
associates
generally
and
though
by
no
means
a
person
of
uniformly
firm
health
he
seemed
to
possess
such
vigor
and
strength
of
constitution
that
i
thought
his
life
as
likely
to
be
extended
twenty
years
longer
as
that
of
any
member
of
the
mission
he
continued
his
system
of
morning
exercise
commenced
when
a
student
at
andover
and
was
not
satisfied
with
a
common
walk
on
level
ground
but
always
chose
an
path
and
then
frequently
went
bounding
on
his
way
with
all
the
exuberant
activity
of
boyhood
he
was
of
a
singularly
happy
temperament
although
not
of
that
even
cast
which
never
rises
above
a
certain
level
and
is
never
depressed
possessing
acute
sensibilities
suffering
with
those
who
suffered
and
entering
as
readily
into
the
joys
of
the
prosperous
and
happy
he
was
variable
in
his
moods
but
religion
formed
such
an
essential
element
in
his
character
and
his
trust
in
providence
was
so
implicit
and
habitual
that
he
was
never
gloomy
and
seldom
more
than
momentarily
disheartened
on
the
other
hand
being
accustomed
to
regard
all
the
events
of
this
life
however
minute
or
painful
as
ordered
in
wisdom
and
tending
to
one
great
and
glorious
end
he
lived
in
almost
constant
obedience
to
the
apostolic
injunction
rejoice
evermore
he
often
told
me
that
although
he
had
endured
much
personal
suffering
and
passed
through
many
fearful
trials
in
the
course
of
his
eventful
life
a
kind
providence
had
also
hedged
him
round
with
precious
peculiar
blessings
so
that
his
joys
had
far
outnumbered
his
sorrows
toward
the
close
of
september
of
last
year
he
said
to
me
one
evening
what
deep
cause
have
we
for
gratitude
to
god
do
you
believe
there
are
any
other
two
persons
in
the
wide
world
so
happy
as
we
are
enumerating
in
his
own
earnest
manner
several
sources
of
happiness
in
which
our
work
as
missionaries
and
our
eternal
prospects
occupied
a
prominent
position
when
he
had
finished
his
glowing
picture
i
remarked
i
scarcely
know
why
but
there
was
a
heavy
cloud
upon
my
spirits
that
evening
we
are
certainly
very
happy
now
but
it
can
not
be
so
always
i
am
thinking
of
the
time
when
one
of
us
must
stand
beside
the
bed
and
see
the
other
die
yes
he
said
that
will
be
a
sad
moment
i
felt
it
most
deeply
a
little
while
ago
but
now
it
would
not
be
strange
if
your
life
were
prolonged
beyond
mine
though
i
should
wish
if
it
were
possible
to
spare
you
that
pain
it
is
the
one
left
alone
who
suffers
not
the
one
who
goes
to
be
with
christ
if
it
should
only
be
the
will
of
god
that
we
might
go
together
like
young
james
and
his
wife
but
he
will
order
all
things
well
and
we
can
safely
trust
our
future
to
his
hands
that
same
night
we
were
roused
from
sleep
by
the
sudden
illness
of
one
of
the
children
there
was
an
unpleasant
chilling
dampness
in
the
air
as
it
came
to
us
through
the
openings
in
the
sloats
above
the
windows
which
affected
your
brother
very
sensibly
and
he
soon
began
to
shiver
so
violently
that
he
was
obliged
to
return
to
his
couch
where
he
remained
under
a
warm
covering
until
morning
in
the
morning
he
awoke
with
a
severe
cold
accompanied
by
some
degree
of
fever
but
as
it
did
not
seem
very
serious
and
our
three
children
were
all
suffering
from
a
similar
cause
we
failed
to
give
it
any
especial
attention
from
that
time
he
was
never
well
though
in
writing
to
you
before
i
think
i
dated
the
commencement
of
his
illness
from
the
month
of
november
when
he
laid
aside
his
studies
i
know
that
he
regarded
this
attack
as
trifling
and
yet
one
evening
he
spent
a
long
time
in
advising
me
with
regard
to
my
future
course
if
i
should
be
deprived
of
his
guidance
saying
that
it
is
always
wise
to
be
prepared
for
exigences
of
this
nature
after
the
month
of
november
he
failed
gradually
occasionally
rallying
in
such
a
manner
as
to
deceive
us
all
but
at
each
relapse
sinking
lower
than
at
the
previous
one
though
still
full
of
hope
and
courage
and
yielding
ground
only
inch
by
inch
as
compelled
by
the
triumphant
progress
of
disease
during
some
hours
of
every
day
he
suffered
intense
pain
but
his
naturally
buoyant
spirits
and
uncomplaining
disposition
led
him
to
speak
so
lightly
of
it
that
i
used
sometimes
to
fear
the
doctor
though
a
very
skilful
man
would
be
fatally
deceived
as
his
health
declined
his
mental
exercises
at
first
seemed
deepened
and
he
gave
still
larger
portions
of
his
time
to
prayer
conversing
with
the
utmost
freedom
on
his
daily
progress
and
the
extent
of
his
just
before
our
trip
to
mergui
which
took
place
in
january
he
looked
up
from
his
pillow
one
day
with
sudden
animation
and
said
to
me
earnestly
i
have
gained
the
victory
at
last
i
love
every
one
of
christ
redeemed
as
i
believe
he
would
have
me
love
them
in
the
same
manner
though
not
probably
to
the
same
degree
as
we
shall
love
one
another
in
heaven
and
gladly
would
i
prefer
the
meanest
of
his
creatures
who
bears
his
name
before
myself
this
he
said
in
allusion
to
the
text
in
honor
preferring
one
another
on
which
he
had
frequently
dwelt
with
great
emphasis
after
farther
similar
conversation
he
concluded
and
now
here
i
lie
at
peace
with
all
the
world
and
what
is
better
still
at
peace
with
my
own
conscience
i
know
that
i
am
a
miserable
sinner
in
the
sight
of
god
with
no
hope
but
in
the
blessed
saviour
merits
but
i
can
not
think
of
any
particular
fault
any
peculiarly
besetting
sin
which
it
is
now
my
duty
to
correct
can
you
tell
me
of
any
and
truly
from
this
time
no
other
word
would
so
well
express
his
state
of
feeling
as
that
one
of
his
own
choosing
he
had
no
particular
exercises
afterwards
but
remained
calm
and
serene
speaking
of
himself
daily
as
a
great
sinner
who
had
been
overwhelmed
with
benefits
and
declaring
that
he
had
never
in
all
his
life
before
had
such
delightful
views
of
the
unfathomable
love
and
infinite
condescension
of
the
saviour
as
were
now
daily
opening
before
him
oh
the
love
of
christ
the
love
of
christ
he
would
suddenly
exclaim
while
his
eye
kindled
and
the
tears
chased
each
other
down
his
cheeks
we
can
not
understand
it
now
but
what
a
beautiful
study
for
eternity
after
our
return
from
mergui
the
doctor
advised
a
still
farther
trial
of
the
effects
of
sea
air
and
and
we
accordingly
proceeded
to
amherst
where
we
remained
nearly
a
month
this
to
me
was
the
darkest
period
of
his
illness
no
medical
adviser
no
friend
at
hand
and
he
daily
growing
weaker
and
weaker
he
began
to
totter
in
walking
clinging
to
the
furniture
and
walls
when
he
thought
he
was
unobserved
for
he
was
not
willing
to
acknowledge
the
extent
of
his
debility
and
his
wan
face
was
of
a
ghastly
paleness
his
sufferings
too
were
sometimes
fearfully
intense
so
that
in
spite
of
his
habitual
his
groans
would
fill
the
house
at
other
times
a
kind
of
lethargy
seemed
to
steal
over
him
and
he
would
sleep
almost
incessantly
for
hours
seeming
annoyed
if
he
were
aroused
or
disturbed
yet
there
were
portions
of
the
time
when
he
was
comparatively
comfortable
and
conversed
intelligently
but
his
mind
seemed
to
revert
to
former
scenes
and
he
tried
to
amuse
me
with
stories
of
his
boyhood
his
college
days
his
imprisonment
in
france
and
his
early
missionary
life
he
had
a
great
deal
also
to
say
on
his
favorite
theme
the
love
of
christ
but
his
strength
was
too
much
impaired
for
any
continuous
mental
effort
even
a
short
prayer
made
audibly
exhausted
him
to
such
a
degree
that
he
was
obliged
to
discontinue
the
practice
at
length
i
wrote
to
maulmain
giving
some
expression
of
my
anxieties
and
misgivings
and
our
kind
missionary
friends
who
had
from
the
first
evinced
all
the
tender
interest
and
watchful
sympathy
of
the
nearest
kindred
immediately
sent
for
us
the
doctor
advising
a
but
as
there
was
no
vessel
in
the
harbor
bound
for
a
port
sufficiently
distant
we
thought
it
best
in
the
meantime
to
remove
from
our
old
dwelling
which
had
long
been
condemned
as
unhealthy
to
another
fortunately
empty
this
change
was
at
first
attended
with
the
most
beneficial
results
and
our
hopes
revived
so
much
that
we
looked
forward
to
the
approaching
rainy
season
for
entire
restoration
but
it
lasted
only
a
little
while
and
then
both
of
us
became
convinced
that
though
a
voyage
at
sea
involved
much
that
was
exceedingly
painful
it
yet
presented
the
only
prospect
of
recovery
and
could
not
therefore
without
a
breach
of
duty
be
neglected
oh
if
it
were
only
the
will
of
god
to
take
me
now
to
let
me
die
here
he
repeated
over
and
over
again
in
a
tone
of
anguish
while
we
where
considering
the
subject
i
can
not
can
not
go
this
is
almost
more
than
i
can
bear
was
there
ever
suffering
like
our
suffering
and
the
like
broken
expressions
were
continually
falling
from
his
lips
but
he
soon
gathered
more
strength
of
purpose
and
after
the
decision
was
fairly
made
he
never
hesitated
for
a
moment
rather
regarding
the
prospect
with
pleasure
i
think
the
struggle
which
this
resolution
cost
injured
him
very
materially
though
probably
it
had
no
share
in
bringing
about
the
final
result
god
who
saw
the
end
from
the
beginning
had
counted
out
his
days
and
they
were
hastening
to
a
close
until
this
time
he
had
been
able
to
stand
and
to
walk
slowly
from
room
to
room
but
as
he
one
evening
attempted
to
rise
from
his
chair
he
was
suddenly
deprived
of
his
small
remnant
of
muscular
strength
and
would
have
fallen
to
the
floor
but
for
timely
support
from
that
moment
his
decline
was
rapid
as
he
lay
helplessly
upon
his
couch
and
watched
the
swelling
of
his
feet
and
other
alarming
symptoms
he
became
very
anxious
to
commence
his
voyage
and
i
felt
equally
anxious
to
have
his
wishes
gratified
i
still
hoped
he
might
recover
the
doctor
said
the
chances
of
life
and
death
were
in
his
opinion
equally
balanced
and
then
he
always
loved
the
sea
so
dearly
there
was
something
exhilarating
to
him
in
the
motion
of
a
vessel
and
he
spoke
with
animation
of
getting
free
from
the
almost
suffocating
atmosphere
incident
to
the
hot
season
and
drinking
in
the
fresh
sea
breezes
he
talked
but
little
more
however
than
was
necessary
to
indicate
his
wants
his
bodily
sufferings
being
too
great
to
allow
of
conversation
but
several
times
he
looked
up
to
me
with
a
bright
smile
and
exclaimed
as
heretofore
oh
the
love
of
christ
the
love
of
christ
i
found
it
difficult
to
ascertain
from
expressions
casually
dropped
from
time
to
time
his
real
opinion
with
regard
to
his
recovery
but
i
thought
there
was
some
reason
to
doubt
whether
he
was
fully
aware
of
his
critical
situation
i
did
not
suppose
he
had
any
preparation
to
make
at
this
late
hour
and
i
felt
sure
that
if
he
should
be
called
ever
so
unexpectedly
he
would
not
enter
the
presence
of
his
maker
with
a
ruffled
spirit
but
i
could
not
bear
to
have
him
go
away
without
knowing
how
doubtful
it
was
whether
our
next
meeting
would
not
be
in
eternity
and
perhaps
too
in
my
own
distress
i
might
still
have
looked
for
words
of
encouragement
and
sympathy
to
a
source
which
had
never
before
failed
it
was
late
in
the
night
and
i
had
been
performing
some
little
offices
when
suddenly
he
looked
up
to
me
and
exclaimed
this
will
never
do
you
are
killing
yourself
for
me
and
i
will
not
permit
it
you
must
have
some
one
to
relieve
you
if
i
had
not
been
made
selfish
by
suffering
i
should
have
insisted
upon
it
long
ago
he
spoke
so
like
himself
with
the
earnestness
of
health
and
in
a
tone
to
which
my
ear
had
of
late
been
a
stranger
that
for
a
moment
i
felt
almost
bewildered
with
sudden
hope
he
received
my
reply
to
what
he
had
said
with
a
smile
but
in
the
meantime
his
expression
had
changed
the
marks
of
excessive
debility
were
again
apparent
and
i
could
not
forbear
adding
it
is
only
a
little
while
you
know
only
a
little
while
he
repeated
mournfully
this
separation
is
a
bitter
thing
but
it
does
not
distress
me
now
as
it
did
i
am
too
weak
you
have
no
reason
to
be
distressed
i
answered
with
such
glorious
prospects
before
you
you
have
often
told
me
it
is
the
one
left
alone
who
suffers
not
the
one
who
goes
to
be
with
christ
he
gave
me
a
rapid
questioning
glance
then
assumed
for
several
moments
an
attitude
of
deep
thought
finally
he
slowly
unclosed
his
eyes
and
fixing
them
on
me
said
in
a
calm
earnest
tone
i
do
not
believe
i
am
going
to
die
i
think
i
know
why
this
illness
has
been
sent
upon
me
i
needed
it
i
feel
that
it
has
done
me
good
and
it
is
my
impression
that
i
shall
now
recover
and
be
a
better
and
more
useful
man
then
it
is
your
wish
to
recover
i
inquired
if
it
should
be
the
will
of
god
yes
i
should
like
to
complete
the
dictionary
on
which
i
have
bestowed
so
much
labor
now
that
it
is
so
nearly
done
for
though
it
has
not
been
a
work
that
pleased
my
taste
or
quite
satisfied
my
feelings
i
have
never
underrated
its
importance
then
after
that
come
all
the
plans
we
have
formed
oh
i
feel
as
though
only
just
beginning
to
be
prepared
for
usefulness
it
is
the
opinion
of
most
of
the
mission
i
remarked
that
you
will
not
recover
i
know
it
is
he
replied
and
i
suppose
they
think
me
an
old
man
and
imagine
that
it
is
nothing
for
one
like
me
to
resign
a
life
so
full
of
trials
but
i
am
not
old
at
least
in
that
sense
you
know
i
am
not
oh
no
man
ever
left
this
world
with
more
inviting
prospects
with
brighter
hopes
or
warmer
feelings
warmer
feelings
he
repeated
and
burst
into
tears
his
face
was
perfectly
placid
even
while
the
tears
broke
away
from
the
closed
lids
and
rolled
one
after
another
down
to
the
pillow
there
was
no
trace
of
agitation
or
pain
in
his
manner
of
weeping
but
it
was
evidently
the
result
of
acute
sensibilities
combined
with
great
physical
weakness
to
some
suggestions
which
i
ventured
to
make
he
replied
it
is
not
that
i
know
all
that
and
feel
it
in
my
inmost
heart
lying
here
on
my
bed
when
i
could
not
talk
i
have
had
such
views
of
the
loving
condescension
of
christ
and
the
glories
of
heaven
as
i
believe
are
seldom
granted
to
mortal
man
it
is
not
because
i
shrink
from
death
that
i
wish
to
live
neither
is
it
because
the
ties
that
bind
me
here
though
some
of
them
are
very
sweet
bear
any
comparison
with
the
drawings
i
at
times
feel
towards
heaven
but
a
few
years
would
not
be
missed
from
my
eternity
of
bliss
and
i
can
well
afford
to
spare
them
both
for
your
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
the
poor
burmans
i
am
not
tired
of
my
work
neither
am
i
tired
of
the
world
yet
when
christ
calls
me
home
i
shall
go
with
the
gladness
of
a
boy
bounding
away
from
his
school
perhaps
i
feel
something
like
the
young
bride
when
she
contemplates
resigning
the
pleasant
associations
of
her
childhood
for
a
yet
dearer
home
though
only
a
very
little
like
her
for
is
no
doubt
resting
on
my
then
death
would
not
take
you
by
surprise
i
remarked
if
it
should
come
even
before
you
could
get
on
board
ship
oh
no
he
said
death
will
never
take
me
by
surprise
do
not
be
afraid
of
that
i
feel
strong
in
he
has
not
led
me
so
tenderly
thus
far
to
forsake
me
at
the
very
gate
of
heaven
no
no
i
am
willing
to
live
a
few
years
longer
if
it
should
be
so
ordered
and
if
otherwise
i
am
willing
and
glad
to
die
now
i
leave
myself
entirely
in
the
hands
of
god
to
be
disposed
of
according
to
his
holy
will
the
next
day
some
one
mentioned
in
his
presence
that
the
native
christians
were
greatly
opposed
to
the
voyage
and
that
many
other
persons
had
a
similar
feeling
with
regard
to
it
i
thought
he
seemed
troubled
and
after
the
visitor
had
withdrawn
i
inquired
if
he
still
felt
as
when
he
conversed
with
me
the
night
previous
he
replied
oh
yes
that
was
no
evanescent
feeling
it
has
been
with
me
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
for
years
and
will
be
with
me
i
trust
to
the
end
i
am
ready
to
go
if
it
should
be
the
will
of
god
this
very
hour
but
i
am
not
to
die
at
least
when
i
am
not
beside
myself
with
pain
then
why
are
you
so
desirous
to
go
to
sea
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
you
no
he
answered
quietly
my
judgment
tells
me
it
would
be
wrong
not
to
go
the
doctor
says
i
shall
certainly
die
here
if
i
go
away
i
may
possibly
recover
there
is
no
question
with
regard
to
duty
in
such
a
case
and
i
do
not
like
to
see
any
hesitation
even
though
it
springs
from
affection
he
several
times
spoke
of
a
burial
at
sea
and
always
as
though
the
prospect
were
agreeable
it
brought
he
said
a
sense
of
freedom
and
expansion
and
seemed
far
pleasanter
than
the
confined
dark
narrow
grave
to
which
he
had
committed
so
many
that
he
loved
and
he
added
that
although
his
was
a
matter
of
no
real
importance
yet
he
believed
it
was
not
in
human
nature
to
be
altogether
without
a
choice
i
have
already
given
you
an
account
of
the
embarkation
of
my
visits
to
him
while
the
vessel
remained
in
the
river
and
of
our
last
sad
silent
parting
and
ranney
has
finished
the
picture
you
will
find
in
this
closing
part
some
dark
shadows
that
will
give
you
pain
but
you
must
remember
that
his
present
felicity
is
enhanced
by
those
very
sufferings
and
we
should
regret
nothing
that
serves
to
brighten
his
crown
in
glory
i
ought
also
to
add
that
i
have
gained
pleasanter
impressions
in
conversation
with
than
from
his
written
account
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
convey
them
to
you
and
as
he
whom
they
concern
was
accustomed
to
say
of
similar
things
you
will
learn
it
all
in
heaven
during
the
last
hour
of
your
sainted
brother
life
ranney
bent
over
him
and
held
his
hand
while
poor
pinapah
stood
at
a
little
distance
weeping
bitterly
the
table
had
been
spread
in
the
cuddy
as
usual
and
the
officers
did
not
know
what
was
passing
in
the
cabin
till
summoned
to
dinner
then
they
gathered
about
the
door
and
watched
the
closing
scene
with
solemn
reverence
now
thanks
to
a
merciful
god
his
pains
had
left
him
not
a
momentary
spasm
disturbed
his
placid
face
nor
did
the
contraction
of
a
muscle
denote
the
least
degree
of
suffering
the
agony
of
death
was
passed
and
his
wearied
spirit
was
turning
to
its
rest
in
the
bosom
of
his
saviour
from
time
to
time
he
pressed
the
hand
in
which
his
own
was
resting
his
clasp
losing
in
force
at
each
successive
pressure
while
his
shortened
breath
though
there
was
no
struggle
no
gasping
as
if
it
came
and
went
with
difficulty
gradually
grew
softer
and
fainter
until
it
died
upon
the
air
and
he
was
gone
ranney
closed
the
eyes
and
composed
the
passive
limbs
the
officers
stole
softly
from
the
door
and
the
neglected
meal
was
left
upon
the
board
untasted
they
lowered
him
to
his
without
a
prayer
for
his
freed
spirit
had
soared
above
the
reach
of
earthly
intercession
and
to
the
foreigners
who
stood
around
it
would
have
been
a
senseless
form
and
there
they
left
him
in
his
unquiet
sepulchre
but
it
matters
little
for
we
know
that
while
the
unconscious
clay
is
drifting
on
the
shifting
currents
of
the
restless
main
nothing
can
disturb
the
hallowed
rest
of
the
immortal
spirit
neither
could
he
have
a
more
fitting
monument
than
the
blue
waves
which
visit
every
coast
for
his
warm
sympathies
went
forth
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
and
included
the
whole
family
of
man
it
is
all
as
god
would
have
it
and
our
duty
is
but
to
bend
meekly
to
his
will
and
wait
in
faith
and
patience
till
we
also
shall
be
summoned
home
chapter
ii
conclusion
last
scene
of
all
to
close
this
sad
eventful
history
scarcely
four
years
ago
in
sickness
and
loneliness
and
sad
suspense
in
her
burman
home
from
which
had
departed
alas
forever
its
light
and
head
emily
judson
penned
the
foregoing
beautiful
letter
read
again
its
closing
sentence
and
note
how
short
a
time
she
has
waited
in
faith
and
patience
how
she
has
been
summoned
home
for
it
would
be
wrong
for
us
to
mourn
she
has
rejoined
that
circle
which
she
loved
so
well
on
earth
in
a
land
where
sickness
and
sorrow
pain
and
death
are
felt
and
no
more
but
to
her
aged
parents
to
the
little
flock
to
whom
she
was
as
the
tenderest
mother
to
the
literary
world
which
enjoyed
the
ripe
fruits
of
her
genius
to
the
christian
world
of
which
she
was
a
shining
ornament
and
glory
her
loss
is
irreparable
in
her
own
inimitable
words
we
may
exclaim
weep
ye
bereaved
a
dearer
head
left
the
pillowing
breast
the
good
the
pure
the
lovely
fled
when
mingling
with
the
shadowy
dead
she
meekly
went
to
rest
angels
rejoice
another
string
has
caught
the
strains
above
rejoice
rejoice
a
wing
around
the
throne
is
hovering
in
sweet
glad
wondering
love
but
though
one
of
the
sweet
fountains
that
well
up
here
and
there
in
our
desert
world
and
surround
themselves
with
greenness
and
beauty
and
life
has
been
exhaled
to
heaven
still
it
is
refreshing
to
know
that
its
streams
which
made
glad
so
many
hearts
have
not
perished
for
they
were
of
living
water
springing
up
into
immortality
the
writer
is
lost
to
us
her
writings
remain
by
them
she
being
dead
yet
speaketh
and
through
them
whensoever
we
will
she
may
talk
with
us
judson
final
malady
was
consumption
but
for
several
years
her
health
had
been
feeble
one
who
saw
her
just
before
she
left
america
says
looking
upon
her
we
saw
at
once
that
it
was
a
spirit
which
had
already
outworn
its
frame
a
slight
pale
delicate
and
transparent
creature
every
thought
and
feeling
shining
through
and
every
word
and
movement
tremulous
with
fragility
we
said
farewell
with
no
thought
that
she
would
ever
return
from
her
voyage
across
the
ocean
she
suffered
less
than
was
apprehended
and
for
a
time
she
found
the
climate
of
india
rather
congenial
than
otherwise
to
her
constitution
her
short
residence
at
rangoon
whither
her
husband
removed
with
his
family
soon
after
reaching
burmah
was
indeed
a
period
of
great
suffering
and
would
have
given
a
shock
to
a
much
hardier
constitution
her
narrative
of
their
sufferings
there
contained
in
the
life
of
her
husband
by
wayland
excites
our
wonder
that
she
survived
them
but
after
their
removal
to
maulmain
she
was
restored
to
comparative
health
a
letter
from
her
husband
written
in
the
latter
part
of
when
her
little
emily
frances
her
bird
was
one
year
old
gives
a
glowing
picture
of
their
happiness
and
their
labors
he
playfully
says
even
young
romance
writer
had
made
a
little
book
scripture
questions
and
she
manages
to
conduct
a
bible
class
and
native
female
so
that
i
hope
she
will
yet
come
to
some
good
but
a
letter
written
to
miss
anable
philadelphia
in
the
spring
of
is
in
a
different
strain
a
dark
cloud
is
gathering
round
me
a
crushing
weight
is
upon
me
i
can
not
resist
the
dreadful
conviction
that
dear
emily
is
in
a
settled
and
rapid
decline
after
speaking
of
the
many
means
he
had
unsuccessfully
employed
for
her
restoration
he
says
the
symptoms
are
such
that
i
have
scarcely
any
hope
left
if
a
change
to
any
place
promised
the
least
relief
i
would
go
anywhere
but
we
are
here
in
the
healthiest
part
of
india
in
the
dry
warm
season
and
she
suffers
so
much
at
sea
that
a
voyage
could
hardly
be
recommended
for
itself
my
only
hope
is
the
doctor
declares
her
lungs
are
not
seriously
affected
when
at
tavoy
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
must
die
soon
and
that
is
now
her
prevailing
expectation
but
she
contemplates
the
event
with
composure
and
resignation
though
she
feels
that
in
her
circumstances
prolonged
life
is
exceedingly
desirable
she
is
quite
willing
to
leave
all
at
the
savior
call
praise
be
to
god
for
his
love
to
her
some
days
later
he
adds
emily
is
better
but
though
the
is
removed
from
my
heart
i
do
not
venture
to
indulge
any
sanguine
hopes
after
what
i
have
seen
do
remember
us
in
your
prayers
the
doctor
predictions
proved
correct
judson
partially
recovered
from
this
attack
although
in
august
her
husband
writes
emily
health
is
very
delicate
her
hold
on
life
very
precarious
alas
his
own
hold
on
life
was
more
precarious
still
in
the
following
spring
the
heart
that
had
beat
for
her
so
fondly
and
truly
was
consigned
to
its
unquiet
sepulchre
the
blue
waves
which
visit
every
coast
his
only
and
fitting
monument
while
the
object
of
his
tender
solicitude
was
compelled
to
endure
four
months
the
agony
of
suspense
as
to
fate
terminated
by
the
sad
certainty
of
his
death
after
the
death
of
her
husband
judson
expressed
a
strong
desire
to
remain
in
burmah
and
devote
herself
to
the
cause
which
was
so
dear
to
her
husband
and
her
own
heart
but
her
health
always
delicate
was
so
unfavorably
affected
by
that
climate
that
her
physicians
were
of
opinion
another
rainy
season
would
terminate
her
life
a
numerous
family
of
children
several
of
whom
were
in
this
country
needed
her
maternal
care
and
guidance
and
for
their
sakes
as
well
as
for
her
own
she
left
burmah
in
the
winter
following
her
husband
death
and
arrived
in
this
country
in
october
after
an
absence
of
five
years
and
three
months
she
found
in
the
beautiful
village
of
hamilton
a
sequestered
and
lovely
home
for
herself
and
her
family
which
consisted
of
her
aged
parents
the
five
children
of
sarah
judson
and
her
own
bird
emily
frances
the
cares
of
her
family
and
literary
labors
here
divided
her
time
until
the
prostration
of
her
health
by
her
last
sickness
since
which
period
she
has
set
her
house
in
order
and
calmly
awaited
the
summons
of
death
peacefully
and
sweetly
did
the
summons
come
and
on
the
first
of
june
she
fell
asleep
in
jesus
with
a
sister
poet
she
might
have
said
i
passing
through
the
eternal
gates
ere
june
sweet
roses
blow
she
had
often
spoken
of
this
rich
and
glorious
month
as
her
time
to
die
and
repeated
bryant
hymn
pleasant
that
in
flowery
june
when
brooks
send
up
a
cheerful
tune
and
groves
a
joyous
sound
the
sexton
hand
my
grave
to
make
the
rich
green
should
break
nature
had
no
more
ardent
lover
than
she
and
it
is
pleasant
to
think
that
her
dust
is
returning
to
dust
in
a
lovely
village
under
the
pure
air
of
heaven
and
amid
the
luxuriance
of
flowers
pleasant
also
is
it
to
read
that
a
vast
concourse
of
sincere
admirers
and
loving
friends
and
among
them
all
her
children
eagerly
testified
their
respect
to
her
by
attending
her
remains
to
their
burial
to
her
glorified
spirit
such
manifestations
may
indeed
be
of
little
moment
yet
even
her
glorified
spirit
may
feel
a
new
thrill
of
pleasure
in
beholding
from
its
serene
sphere
the
love
that
prompted
them
and
sought
in
the
choice
of
her
last
to
give
even
to
the
unconscious
dead
one
more
proof
of
affection
in
so
imperfect
a
sketch
as
ours
a
delineation
of
the
character
of
judson
will
not
be
attempted
we
would
not
if
we
could
anticipate
her
memoir
which
it
is
said
will
soon
be
published
from
documents
open
to
the
public
we
shall
merely
glean
such
notices
of
her
life
and
character
as
shall
induce
in
our
readers
a
desire
to
know
those
details
of
her
personal
history
which
will
doubtless
be
found
in
her
biography
from
what
we
can
learn
we
infer
that
the
prominent
traits
in
her
character
were
strong
affections
energy
and
disinterestedness
of
a
slight
and
delicate
frame
and
constitution
and
a
sensibility
almost
amounting
to
sensitiveness
she
at
an
early
age
engaged
in
duties
and
made
sacrifices
scarcely
expected
from
the
robust
and
vigorous
and
her
exertions
had
for
their
end
mainly
to
benefit
those
she
loved
whether
she
taught
in
the
district
school
or
in
the
higher
seminary
or
wrote
books
or
contributed
to
literary
periodicals
her
affection
for
her
mother
and
desire
to
lighten
her
burdens
seem
to
have
stimulated
her
exertions
and
called
forth
her
powers
in
her
early
religious
experience
the
same
disinterestedness
manifested
itself
for
no
sooner
did
she
feel
the
renewing
power
of
faith
in
her
own
heart
than
she
longed
to
impart
even
to
the
distant
heathen
the
same
precious
blessing
unselfish
affection
is
also
we
think
a
strongly
marked
trait
in
her
married
life
not
long
after
their
arrival
in
burmah
judson
writes
emily
loves
the
children
as
if
they
were
her
own
and
again
nearly
two
years
later
we
are
a
deliciously
happy
family
and
again
emily
has
taken
to
my
two
boys
as
if
they
were
her
own
so
that
we
are
a
very
happy
family
not
a
happier
i
am
sure
on
the
broad
earth
another
proof
of
the
same
trait
was
her
loving
and
sympathetic
appreciation
of
a
peculiar
trait
in
her
husband
which
had
her
disposition
been
less
noble
might
have
caused
her
some
annoyance
of
this
trait
wayland
thus
speaks
there
was
a
feature
in
affection
as
a
husband
which
was
i
think
peculiar
he
was
as
it
is
well
known
married
three
times
and
no
man
was
ever
more
tenderly
attached
to
each
of
his
wives
the
present
affection
however
seemed
in
no
respect
to
lessen
his
affection
for
those
for
whom
he
mourned
he
ever
spoke
of
those
who
had
gone
before
with
undiminished
interest
in
one
of
his
letters
to
his
daughter
after
saying
he
did
not
believe
there
existed
on
earth
so
happy
a
family
as
his
he
soon
after
adds
tears
fall
frequently
for
her
who
lies
in
her
lone
bed
at
st
helena
it
was
at
his
suggestion
that
emily
judson
wrote
the
life
of
her
predecessor
he
frequently
refers
with
delight
to
the
time
when
he
and
all
those
whom
he
so
much
loved
shall
meet
in
paradise
no
more
to
part
but
to
spend
an
eternity
together
in
the
presence
of
christ
those
that
were
once
loved
were
loved
to
the
end
but
this
did
not
prevent
the
bestowment
of
an
equal
amount
of
affection
on
a
successor
to
quote
the
words
of
another
speaking
of
mary
ware
who
placed
in
similar
circumstances
to
judson
showed
the
same
noble
superiority
to
a
common
weakness
of
her
sex
she
had
no
sympathy
and
little
respect
for
that
narrow
view
which
insists
that
the
departed
and
the
living
can
not
share
the
same
pure
love
of
the
same
true
heart
with
regard
to
a
former
wife
was
the
nearest
and
dearest
to
him
she
would
say
then
can
i
do
otherwise
than
love
and
cherish
her
memory
and
children
she
received
as
a
precious
legacy
they
were
to
her
from
the
first
moment
like
her
own
neither
she
nor
they
knew
any
distinction
since
writing
the
above
we
have
seen
a
poem
entitled
love
last
wish
addressed
to
her
husband
by
judson
when
she
thought
herself
near
death
which
expresses
so
beautifully
the
sentiment
we
have
here
attributed
to
her
that
did
our
limits
permit
we
would
copy
the
whole
we
can
only
give
an
extract
thou
i
fading
day
by
day
and
in
thy
face
i
read
thy
fears
it
would
be
hard
to
pass
away
so
soon
and
leave
thee
to
thy
tears
i
hoped
to
linger
by
thy
side
until
thy
homeward
call
was
given
then
silent
to
my
pillow
glide
and
wake
upon
thy
breast
in
heaven
i
do
not
ask
to
be
forgot
i
read
thy
heart
in
every
line
and
know
that
there
one
sacred
spot
betide
will
still
be
mine
for
death
but
lays
its
mystic
spell
upon
affection
earthliness
i
know
that
though
thou
me
well
thy
sainted
none
the
and
when
at
last
we
meet
above
where
marriage
vows
are
never
spoken
all
shall
form
one
chain
of
whose
can
be
broken
of
judson
happiness
in
her
married
and
missionary
life
we
feel
bound
to
say
a
few
words
because
the
tone
of
some
articles
written
since
her
death
would
lead
to
the
impression
that
so
far
from
having
had
any
enjoyment
as
a
wife
a
mother
and
a
missionary
she
had
sacrificed
not
only
all
her
literary
aspirations
but
her
whole
earthly
happiness
to
her
desire
to
benefit
the
heathen
thus
one
widely
circulated
article
speaks
of
her
as
a
slow
martyrdom
of
sacrifices
and
sorrows
as
filled
with
bitterness
speaks
too
of
the
agony
wrung
out
of
her
heart
by
suspense
in
regard
to
her
husband
fate
expressed
in
that
exquisite
piece
to
her
mother
page
as
one
hour
of
the
she
in
burmah
that
the
life
of
any
faithful
missionary
is
one
of
exile
toil
and
privation
we
are
not
disposed
to
deny
the
world
knows
it
too
well
and
seeing
that
such
toils
are
uncheered
by
the
acquisition
of
fame
or
wealth
the
only
reward
it
can
appreciate
the
world
considers
the
life
of
the
missionary
a
living
death
endured
like
martyrdom
only
for
the
sake
of
its
crown
in
the
life
to
come
but
not
in
this
light
was
their
life
considered
by
the
noble
three
whose
history
we
have
sketched
in
this
volume
nor
by
judson
the
elevated
sources
of
happiness
opened
even
in
this
world
to
those
who
literally
obey
the
command
to
forsake
all
for
christ
cast
far
into
the
shade
all
merely
selfish
enjoyment
while
the
pure
domestic
affections
and
the
bliss
resulting
from
them
are
as
much
the
portion
of
the
missionary
as
of
his
favored
brethren
at
home
who
can
read
the
letters
of
judson
in
wayland
memoir
of
him
or
the
exquisite
letters
of
his
widow
found
in
this
volume
without
the
conviction
that
the
latter
years
of
her
life
privileged
as
they
were
with
the
high
companionship
of
one
so
gifted
and
so
dear
as
was
her
husband
and
in
the
midst
of
social
and
domestic
duties
that
brought
their
own
exceeding
great
reward
were
of
all
her
years
the
richest
and
the
happiest
but
her
own
idea
of
the
comparative
happiness
of
her
may
be
best
gathered
from
her
poetry
for
it
is
a
characteristic
and
charm
of
her
verse
that
it
is
the
pouring
forth
of
her
deepest
feelings
at
the
moment
when
they
swayed
her
soul
with
strongest
influence
we
extract
a
few
verses
from
a
poem
written
at
rangoon
during
that
period
of
great
physical
suffering
to
which
we
have
alluded
but
of
which
judson
writes
my
sojourn
in
rangoon
though
tedious
and
trying
in
some
respects
i
regard
as
one
of
the
greenest
spots
one
of
the
brightest
oases
in
the
diversified
wilderness
of
my
life
if
this
world
is
so
happy
what
must
heaven
be
to
my
husband
tis
may
but
no
sweet
violet
springs
in
these
strange
woods
and
dells
the
dear
never
swings
her
little
pearly
bells
but
search
my
heart
and
thou
wilt
see
what
wealth
of
flowers
it
owes
to
thee
the
robin
voice
is
never
heard
from
palm
and
banyan
trees
and
strange
to
me
each
gorgeous
bird
whose
pinion
fans
the
breeze
but
love
white
wing
bends
softly
here
love
thrilling
music
fills
my
ear
the
pure
the
beautiful
the
good
gather
in
this
place
none
but
the
vicious
and
the
rude
the
dark
of
mind
and
face
but
the
wealth
of
thy
vast
is
pressed
into
my
brimming
bowl
here
closely
nestled
by
thy
side
thy
arm
around
me
thrown
i
ask
no
more
mirth
and
stood
oh
so
now
what
is
all
this
world
to
me
since
i
have
found
my
world
in
thee
oh
if
we
are
so
happy
here
amid
our
toils
and
pains
with
thronging
cares
and
dangers
near
and
marr
by
earthly
stains
how
great
must
be
the
compass
given
our
souls
to
the
bliss
of
heaven
as
to
the
sacrifice
of
her
literary
taste
and
reputation
this
is
so
far
from
the
fact
that
we
may
assert
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
the
world
never
knew
her
best
excellence
as
a
writer
till
it
was
startled
as
it
were
by
her
deathless
utterances
wafted
by
east
winds
from
her
indian
home
her
memoir
of
her
predecessor
and
her
appeals
for
burmah
have
thrilled
thousands
of
hearts
that
knew
nothing
of
her
alderbrook
and
her
bird
has
perhaps
awakened
in
many
a
heart
its
first
deep
appreciation
of
the
holy
responsibilities
of
maternity
the
christian
world
gained
much
the
literary
world
lost
nothing
when
fanny
forester

such

we

methinks
her

these
are
no
idle
words
for
says
the
new
york
recorder
her
love
for
the
missionary
enterprise
found
expression
in
an
act
by
which
she
being
dead
will
long
speak
through
the
living
heralds
of
the
cross
by
her
will
as
we
learn
from
an
authentic
source
after
providing
for
the
comfortable
maintenance
of
her
aged
parents
and
the
support
and
education
of
her
daughter
and
the
other
children
of
judson
with
a
small
portion
to
each
as
they
reach
maturity
and
a
few
bequests
to
personal
friends
whatever
may
remain
of
her
property
is
given
to
the
cause
for
which
she
wished
to
live
in
the
same
spirit
that
her
venerated
husband
so
consistently
exemplified
she
was
solicitous
that
the
children
left
in
her
guardianship
should
lack
no
good
that
a
christian
parent
could
desire
beyond
this
and
the
fulfillment
of
filial
duty
her
single
aim
was
the
furtherance
of
his
kingdom
to
whom
her
heart
was
supremely
loyal
and
her
life
unreservedly
devoted
it
is
interesting
to
learn
from
the
same
authority
that
the
youngest
of
judson

a
