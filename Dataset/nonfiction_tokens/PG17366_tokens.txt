the
following
notes
are
by
no
means
intended
as
a
rule
of
thought
by
which
nurses
can
teach
themselves
to
nurse
still
less
as
a
manual
to
teach
nurses
to
nurse
they
are
meant
simply
to
give
hints
for
thought
to
women
who
have
personal
charge
of
the
health
of
others
every
woman
or
at
least
almost
every
woman
in
england
has
at
one
time
or
another
of
her
life
charge
of
the
personal
health
of
somebody
whether
child
or
invalid
in
other
words
every
woman
is
a
nurse

day
sanitary

or
the
knowledge
of
nursing
or
in
other
words
of
how
to
put
the
constitution
in
such
a
state
as
that
it
will
have
no
disease
or
that
it
can
recover
from
disease
takes
a
higher
place
it
is
recognized
as
the
knowledge
which
every
one
ought
to
have
distinct
from
medical
knowledge
which
only
a
profession
can
have
if
then
every
woman
must
at
some
time
or
other
of
her
life
become
a
nurse
have
charge
of
somebody

how
immense
and
how
valuable
would
be
the
produce
of
her
united
experience
if
every
woman
would
think
how
to
nurse
i
do
not
pretend
to
teach

to

appendix
notes
on
nursing
what
it
is
and
what
it
is
not
sidenote
disease
a
reparative
process
shall
we
begin
by
taking
it
as
a
general
principle
that
all
disease
at
some
period
or
other
of
its
course
is
more
or
less
a
reparative
process
not
necessarily
accompanied
with
suffering
an
effort
of
nature
to
remedy
a
process
of
poisoning
or
of
decay
which
has
taken
place
weeks
months
sometimes
years
beforehand
unnoticed
the
termination
of
the
disease
being
then
while
the
antecedent
process
was
going
on
determined
if
we
accept
this
as
a
general
principle
we
shall
be
immediately
met
with
anecdotes
and
instances
to
prove
the
contrary
just
so
if
we
were
to
take
as
a
principle
all
the
climates
of
the
earth
are
meant
to
be
made
habitable
for
man
by
the
efforts
of
man
the
objection
would
be
immediately
raised
will
the
top
of
mont
blanc
ever
be
made
habitable
our
answer
would
be
it
will
be
many
thousands
of
years
before
we
have
reached
the
bottom
of
mont
blanc
in
making
the
earth
healthy
wait
till
we
have
reached
the
bottom
before
we
discuss
the
top
sidenote
of
the
sufferings
of
disease
disease
not
always
the
cause
in
watching
disease
both
in
private
houses
and
in
public
hospitals
the
thing
which
strikes
the
experienced
observer
most
forcibly
is
this
that
the
symptoms
or
the
sufferings
generally
considered
to
be
inevitable
and
incident
to
the
disease
are
very
often
not
symptoms
of
the
disease
at
all
but
of
something
quite
different
of
the
want
of
fresh
air
or
of
light
or
of
warmth
or
of
quiet
or
of
cleanliness
or
of
punctuality
and
care
in
the
administration
of
diet
of
each
or
of
all
of
these
and
this
quite
as
much
in
private
as
in
hospital
nursing
the
reparative
process
which
nature
has
instituted
and
which
we
call
disease
has
been
hindered
by
some
want
of
knowledge
or
attention
in
one
or
in
all
of
these
things
and
pain
suffering
or
interruption
of
the
whole
process
sets
in
if
a
patient
is
cold
if
a
patient
is
feverish
if
a
patient
is
faint
if
he
is
sick
after
taking
food
if
he
has
a
it
is
generally
the
fault
not
of
the
disease
but
of
the
nursing
sidenote
what
nursing
ought
to
do
i
use
the
word
nursing
for
want
of
a
better
it
has
been
limited
to
signify
little
more
than
the
administration
of
medicines
and
the
application
of
poultices
it
ought
to
signify
the
proper
use
of
fresh
air
light
warmth
cleanliness
quiet
and
the
proper
selection
and
administration
of
diet
all
at
the
least
expense
of
vital
power
to
the
patient
sidenote
nursing
the
sick
little
understood
it
has
been
said
and
written
scores
of
times
that
every
woman
makes
a
good
nurse
i
believe
on
the
contrary
that
the
very
elements
of
nursing
are
all
but
unknown
by
this
i
do
not
mean
that
the
nurse
is
always
to
blame
bad
sanitary
bad
architectural
and
bad
administrative
arrangements
often
make
it
impossible
to
nurse
but
the
art
of
nursing
ought
to
include
such
arrangements
as
alone
make
what
i
understand
by
nursing
possible
the
art
of
nursing
as
now
practised
seems
to
be
expressly
constituted
to
unmake
what
god
had
made
disease
to
be
a
reparative
process
sidenote
nursing
ought
to
assist
the
reparative
process
to
recur
to
the
first
objection
if
we
are
asked
is
such
or
such
a
disease
a
reparative
process
can
such
an
illness
be
unaccompanied
with
suffering
will
any
care
prevent
such
a
patient
from
suffering
this
or
that
i
humbly
say
i
do
not
know
but
when
you
have
done
away
with
all
that
pain
and
suffering
which
in
patients
are
the
symptoms
not
of
their
disease
but
of
the
absence
of
one
or
all
of
the
essentials
to
the
success
of
nature
reparative
processes
we
shall
then
know
what
are
the
symptoms
of
and
the
sufferings
inseparable
from
the
disease
another
and
the
commonest
exclamation
which
will
be
instantly
made
is
would
you
do
nothing
then
in
cholera
fever
so
and
universal
is
the
conviction
that
to
give
medicine
is
to
be
doing
something
or
rather
everything
to
give
air
warmth
cleanliness
is
to
do
nothing
the
reply
is
that
in
these
and
many
other
similar
diseases
the
exact
value
of
particular
remedies
and
modes
of
treatment
is
by
no
means
ascertained
while
there
is
universal
experience
as
to
the
extreme
importance
of
careful
nursing
in
determining
the
issue
of
the
disease
sidenote
nursing
the
well
ii
the
very
elements
of
what
constitutes
good
nursing
are
as
little
understood
for
the
well
as
for
the
sick
the
same
laws
of
health
or
of
nursing
for
they
are
in
reality
the
same
obtain
among
the
well
as
among
the
sick
the
breaking
of
them
produces
only
a
less
violent
consequence
among
the
former
than
among
the
latter
and
this
sometimes
not
always
it
is
constantly
objected
but
how
can
i
obtain
this
medical
knowledge
i
am
not
a
doctor
i
must
leave
this
to
doctors
sidenote
little
understood
oh
mothers
of
families
you
who
say
this
do
you
know
that
one
in
every
seven
infants
in
this
civilized
land
of
england
perishes
before
it
is
one
year
old
that
in
london
two
in
every
five
die
before
they
are
five
years
old
and
in
the
other
great
cities
of
england
nearly
one
out
of
two
the
life
duration
of
tender
babies
as
some
saturn
turned
analytical
chemist
says
is
the
most
delicate
test
of
sanitary
conditions
is
all
this
premature
suffering
and
death
necessary
or
did
nature
intend
mothers
to
be
always
accompanied
by
doctors
or
is
it
better
to
learn
the
than
to
learn
the
laws
which
subserve
the
preservation
of
offspring
macaulay
somewhere
says
that
it
is
extraordinary
that
whereas
the
laws
of
the
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
far
removed
as
they
are
from
us
are
perfectly
well
understood
the
laws
of
the
human
mind
which
are
under
our
observation
all
day
and
every
day
are
no
better
understood
than
they
were
two
thousand
years
ago
but
how
much
more
extraordinary
is
it
that
whereas
what
we
might
call
the
coxcombries
of
education
the
elements
of
astronomy
are
now
taught
to
every
neither
mothers
of
families
of
any
class
nor
of
any
class
nor
nurses
of
children
nor
nurses
of
hospitals
are
taught
anything
about
those
laws
which
god
has
assigned
to
the
relations
of
our
bodies
with
the
world
in
which
he
has
put
them
in
other
words
the
laws
which
make
these
bodies
into
which
he
has
put
our
minds
healthy
or
unhealthy
organs
of
those
minds
are
all
but
unlearnt
not
but
that
these
laws
the
laws
of
life
are
in
a
certain
measure
understood
but
not
even
mothers
think
it
worth
their
while
to
study
them
to
study
how
to
give
their
children
healthy
existences
they
call
it
medical
or
physiological
knowledge
fit
only
for
doctors
another
objection
we
are
constantly
told
but
the
circumstances
which
govern
our
children
healths
are
beyond
our
control
what
can
we
do
with
winds
there
is
the
east
wind
most
people
can
tell
before
they
get
up
in
the
morning
whether
the
wind
is
in
the
east
to
this
one
can
answer
with
more
certainty
than
to
the
former
objections
who
is
it
who
knows
when
the
wind
is
in
the
east
not
the
highland
drover
certainly
exposed
to
the
east
wind
but
the
young
lady
who
is
worn
out
with
the
want
of
exposure
to
fresh
air
to
sunlight
put
the
latter
under
as
good
sanitary
circumstances
as
the
former
and
she
too
will
not
know
when
the
wind
is
in
the
east
i
ventilation
and
warming
sidenote
first
rule
of
nursing
to
keep
the
air
within
as
pure
as
the
air
without
the
very
first
canon
of
nursing
the
first
and
the
last
thing
upon
which
a
nurse
attention
must
be
fixed
the
first
essential
to
the
patient
without
which
all
the
rest
you
can
do
for
him
is
as
nothing
with
which
i
had
almost
said
you
may
leave
all
the
rest
alone
is
this
to
keep
the
air
he
breathes
as
pure
as
the
external
air
without
chilling
him
yet
what
is
so
little
attended
to
even
where
it
is
thought
of
at
all
the
most
extraordinary
misconceptions
reign
about
it
even
in
admitting
air
into
the
patient
room
or
ward
few
people
ever
think
where
that
air
comes
from
it
may
come
from
a
corridor
into
which
other
wards
are
ventilated
from
a
hall
always
unaired
always
full
of
the
fumes
of
gas
dinner
of
various
kinds
of
mustiness
from
an
underground
kitchen
sink
washhouse
or
even
as
i
myself
have
had
sorrowful
experience
from
open
sewers
loaded
with
filth
and
with
this
the
patient
room
or
ward
is
aired
as
it
is
called
poisoned
it
should
rather
be
said
always
air
from
the
air
without
and
that
too
through
those
windows
through
which
the
air
comes
freshest
from
a
closed
court
especially
if
the
wind
do
not
blow
that
way
air
may
come
as
stagnant
as
any
from
a
hall
or
corridor
again
a
thing
i
have
often
seen
both
in
private
houses
and
institutions
a
room
remains
uninhabited
the
fire
place
is
carefully
fastened
up
with
a
board
the
windows
are
never
opened
probably
the
shutters
are
kept
always
shut
perhaps
some
kind
of
stores
are
kept
in
the
room
no
breath
of
fresh
air
can
by
possibility
enter
into
that
room
nor
any
ray
of
sun
the
air
is
as
stagnant
musty
and
corrupt
as
it
can
by
possibility
be
made
it
is
quite
ripe
to
breed
scarlet
fever
diphtheria
or
anything
else
you
please
yet
the
nursery
ward
or
sick
room
adjoining
will
positively
be
aired
by
having
the
door
opened
into
that
room
or
children
will
be
put
into
that
room
without
previous
preparation
to
sleep
a
short
time
ago
a
man
walked
into
a
in
queen
square
and
cut
the
throat
of
a
poor
consumptive
creature
sitting
by
the
fire
the
murderer
did
not
deny
the
act
but
simply
said
it
all
right
of
course
he
was
mad
but
in
our
case
the
extraordinary
thing
is
that
the
victim
says
all
right
and
that
we
are
not
mad
yet
although
we
nose
the
murderers
in
the
musty
unaired
unsunned
room
the
scarlet
fever
which
is
behind
the
door
or
the
fever
and
hospital
gangrene
which
are
stalking
among
the
crowded
beds
of
a
hospital
ward
we
say
it
all
right
sidenote
without
chill
with
a
proper
supply
of
windows
and
a
proper
supply
of
fuel
in
open
fire
places
fresh
air
is
comparatively
easy
to
secure
when
your
patient
or
patients
are
in
bed
never
be
afraid
of
open
windows
then
people
do
catch
cold
in
bed
this
is
a
popular
fallacy
with
proper
and
hot
bottles
if
necessary
you
can
always
keep
a
patient
warm
in
bed
and
well
ventilate
him
at
the
same
time
but
a
careless
nurse
be
her
rank
and
education
what
it
may
will
stop
up
every
cranny
and
keep
a
heat
when
her
patient
is
in
bed
and
if
he
is
able
to
get
up
leave
him
comparatively
unprotected
the
time
when
people
take
cold
and
there
are
many
ways
of
taking
cold
besides
a
cold
in
the
nose
is
when
they
first
get
up
after
the
exhaustion
of
dressing
and
of
having
had
the
skin
relaxed
by
many
hours
perhaps
days
in
bed
and
thereby
rendered
more
incapable
of
then
the
same
temperature
which
refreshes
the
patient
in
bed
may
destroy
the
patient
just
risen
and
common
sense
will
point
out
that
while
purity
of
air
is
essential
a
temperature
must
be
secured
which
shall
not
chill
the
patient
otherwise
the
best
that
can
be
expected
will
be
a
feverish
to
have
the
air
within
as
pure
as
the
air
without
it
is
not
necessary
as
often
appears
to
be
thought
to
make
it
as
cold
in
the
afternoon
again
without
care
the
patient
whose
vital
powers
have
then
risen
often
finds
the
room
as
close
and
oppressive
as
he
found
it
cold
in
the
morning
yet
the
nurse
will
be
terrified
if
a
window
is
opened
sidenote
open

i
know
an
intelligent
humane
house
surgeon
who
makes
a
practice
of
keeping
the
ward
windows
open
the
physicians
and
surgeons
invariably
close
them
while
going
their
rounds
and
the
house
surgeon
very
properly
as
invariably
opens
them
whenever
the
doctors
have
turned
their
backs
in
a
little
book
on
nursing
published
a
short
time
ago
we
are
told
that
with
proper
care
it
is
very
seldom
that
the
windows
can
not
be
opened
for
a
few
minutes
twice
in
the
day
to
admit
fresh
air
from
without
i
should
think
not
nor
twice
in
the
hour
either
it
only
shows
how
little
the
subject
has
been
considered
sidenote
what
kind
of
warmth
desirable
of
all
methods
of
keeping
patients
warm
the
very
worst
certainly
is
to
depend
for
heat
on
the
breath
and
bodies
of
the
sick
i
have
known
a
medical
officer
keep
his
ward
windows
hermetically
closed
thus
exposing
the
sick
to
all
the
dangers
of
an
infected
atmosphere
because
he
was
afraid
that
by
admitting
fresh
air
the
temperature
of
the
ward
would
be
too
much
lowered
this
is
a
destructive
fallacy
to
attempt
to
keep
a
ward
warm
at
the
expense
of
making
the
sick
repeatedly
breathe
their
own
hot
humid
putrescing
atmosphere
is
a
certain
way
to
delay
recovery
or
to
destroy

cases

against
the
effects
of
the
loss
of
vital
heat
by
the
patient
himself
in
certain
diseased
states
much
less
heat
is
produced
than
in
health
and
there
is
a
constant
tendency
to
the
decline
and
ultimate
extinction
of
the
vital
powers
by
the
call
made
upon
them
to
sustain
the
heat
of
the

cases
where
this
occurs
should
be
watched
with
the
greatest
care
from
hour
to
hour

had
almost
said
from

hot

hot

patients
are
frequently
lost
in
the
latter
stages
of
disease
from
want
of
attention
to
such
simple
precautions
the
nurse
may
be
trusting
to
the
diet
or
to
his
medicine
or
to
the
occasional
dose
of
stimulant
which
she
is
directed
to
give
him
while
the
patient
is
all
the
while
sinking
from
want
of
a
little
external
warmth
such
cases
happen
at
all
times
even
during
the
height
of
summer
this
fatal
chill
is
most
apt
to
occur
towards
early
morning
at
the
period
of
the
lowest
temperature
of
the
hours
and
at
the
time
when
the
effect
of
the
preceding
day
diets
is
exhausted
generally
speaking
you
may
expect
that
weak
patients
will
suffer
cold
much
more
in
the
morning
than
in
the
evening
the
vital
powers
are
much
lower
if
they
are
feverish
at
night
with
burning
hands
and
feet
they
are
almost
sure
to
be
chilly
and
shivering
in
the
morning
but
nurses
are
very
fond
of
heating
the
at
night
and
of
neglecting
it
in
the
morning
when
they
are
busy
i
should
reverse
the
matter
all
these
things
require
common
sense
and
care
yet
perhaps
in
no
one
single
thing
is
so
little
common
sense
shewn
in
all
ranks
as
in
nursing
sidenote
cold
air
not
ventilation
nor
fresh
air
a
method
of
chill
the
extraordinary
confusion
between
cold
and
ventilation
in
the
minds
of
even
well
educated
people
illustrates
this
to
make
a
room
cold
is
by
no
means
necessarily
to
ventilate
it
nor
is
it
at
all
necessary
in
order
to
ventilate
a
room
to
chill
it
yet
if
a
nurse
finds
a
room
close
she
will
let
out
the
fire
thereby
making
it
closer
or
she
will
open
the
door
into
a
cold
room
without
a
fire
or
an
open
window
in
it
by
way
of
improving
the
ventilation
the
safest
atmosphere
of
all
for
a
patient
is
a
good
fire
and
an
open
window
excepting
in
extremes
of
temperature
yet
no
nurse
can
ever
be
made
to
understand
this
to
ventilate
a
small
room
without
draughts
of
course
requires
more
care
than
to
ventilate
a
large
one
sidenote
night
air
another
extraordinary
fallacy
is
the
dread
of
night
air
what
air
can
we
breathe
at
night
but
night
air
the
choice
is
between
pure
night
air
from
without
and
foul
night
air
from
within
most
people
prefer
the
latter
an
unaccountable
choice
what
will
they
say
if
it
is
proved
to
be
true
that
fully
of
all
the
disease
we
suffer
from
is
occasioned
by
people
sleeping
with
their
windows
shut
an
open
window
most
nights
in
the
year
can
never
hurt
any
one
this
is
not
to
say
that
light
is
not
necessary
for
recovery
in
great
cities
night
air
is
often
the
best
and
purest
air
to
be
had
in
the
hours
i
could
better
understand
in
towns
shutting
the
windows
during
the
day
than
during
the
night
for
the
sake
of
the
sick
the
absence
of
smoke
the
quiet
all
tend
to
making
night
the
best
time
for
airing
the
patients
one
of
our
highest
medical
authorities
on
consumption
and
climate
has
told
me
that
the
air
in
london
is
never
so
good
as
after
ten
at
night
sidenote
air
from
the
outside
open
your
windows
shut
your
doors
always
air
your
room
then
from
the
outside
air
if
possible
windows
are
made
to
open
doors
are
made
to
shut
a
truth
which
seems
extremely
difficult
of
apprehension
i
have
seen
a
careful
nurse
airing
her
patient
room
through
the
door
near
to
which
were
two
gaslights
each
of
which
consumes
as
much
air
as
eleven
men
a
kitchen
a
corridor
the
composition
of
the
atmosphere
in
which
consisted
of
gas
paint
foul
air
never
changed
full
of
effluvia
including
a
current
of
sewer
air
from
an
sink
ascending
in
a
continual
stream
by
a
and
discharging
themselves
constantly
into
the
room
the
window
of
the
said
room
if
opened
was
all
that
was
desirable
to
air
it
every
room
must
be
aired
from
without
every
passage
from
without
but
the
fewer
passages
there
are
in
a
hospital
the
better
sidenote
smoke
if
we
are
to
preserve
the
air
within
as
pure
as
the
air
without
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
chimney
must
not
smoke
almost
all
smoky
chimneys
can
be
cured
from
the
bottom
not
from
the
top
often
it
is
only
necessary
to
have
an
inlet
for
air
to
supply
the
fire
which
is
feeding
itself
for
want
of
this
from
its
own
chimney
on
the
other
hand
almost
all
chimneys
can
be
made
to
smoke
by
a
careless
nurse
who
lets
the
fire
get
low
and
then
overwhelms
it
with
coal
not
as
we
verily
believe
in
order
to
spare
herself
trouble
for
very
rare
is
unkindness
to
the
sick
but
from
not
thinking
what
she
is
about
sidenote
airing
damp
things
in
a
patient
room
in
laying
down
the
principle
that
the
first
object
of
the
nurse
must
be
to
keep
the
air
breathed
by
her
patient
as
pure
as
the
air
without
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
everything
in
the
room
which
can
give
off
effluvia
besides
the
patient
evaporates
itself
into
his
air
and
it
follows
that
there
ought
to
be
nothing
in
the
room
excepting
him
which
can
give
off
effluvia
or
moisture
out
of
all
damp
towels
which
become
dry
in
the
room
the
damp
of
course
goes
into
the
air
yet
this
of
course
seems
as
little
thought
of
as
if
it
were
an
obsolete
fiction
how
very
seldom
you
see
a
nurse
who
acknowledges
by
her
practice
that
nothing
at
all
ought
to
be
aired
in
the
room
that
nothing
at
all
ought
to
be
cooked
at
the
patient
fire
indeed
the
arrangements
often
make
this
rule
impossible
to
observe
if
the
nurse
be
a
very
careful
one
she
will
when
the
patient
leaves
his
bed
but
not
his
room
open
the
sheets
wide
and
throw
the
bed
clothes
back
in
order
to
air
his
bed
and
she
will
spread
the
wet
towels
or
flannels
carefully
out
upon
a
horse
in
order
to
dry
them
now
either
these
and
towels
are
not
dried
and
aired
or
they
dry
and
air
themselves
into
the
patient
air
and
whether
the
damp
and
effluvia
do
him
most
harm
in
his
air
or
in
his
bed
i
leave
to
you
to
determine
for

can
not

of
its

with
unwholesome
matter
from
the
lungs
and
skin
in
disease
where
everything
given
off
from
the
body
is
highly
noxious
and
dangerous
not
only
must
there
be
plenty
of
ventilation
to
carry
off
the
effluvia
but
everything
which
the
patient
passes
must
be
instantly
removed
away
as
being
more
noxious
than
even
the
emanations
from
the
sick
of
the
fatal
effects
of
the

would
seem

of
using

by
the

happily

in

surely

have

they
think
that

will
readily
admit

how

are
there
who
can
intelligently
trace

all
the

whether

it

three
common
errors
in
managing
the
health
of

three
out
of
many
negligences
and
ignorances
in
managing
the
health
of
houses
generally
i
will
here
mention
as
specimens
that
the
female
head
in
charge
of
any
building
does
not
think
it
necessary
to
visit
every
hole
and
corner
of
it
every
day
how
can
she
expect
those
who
are
under
her
to
be
more
careful
to
maintain
her
house
in
a
healthy
condition
than
she
who
is
in
charge
of
it
that
it
is
not
considered
essential
to
air
to
sun
and
to
clean
rooms
while
uninhabited
which
is
simply
ignoring
the
first
elementary
notion
of
sanitary
things
and
laying
the
ground
ready
for
all
kinds
of
that
the
window
and
one
window
is
considered
enough
to
air
a
room
have
you
never
observed
that
any
room
without
a
is
always
close
and
if
you
have
a
would
you
cram
it
up
not
only
with
a
but
perhaps
with
a
great
wisp
of
brown
paper
in
the
throat
of
the
chimney
to
prevent
the
soot
from
coming
down
you
say
if
your
chimney
is
foul
sweep
it
but
do
expect
that
you
can
ever
air
a
room
with
only
one
aperture
do
suppose
that
to
shut
up
a
room
is
the
way
to
keep
it
clean
it
is
the
best
way
to
foul
the
room
and
all
that
is
in
it
do
imagine
that
if
you
who
are
in
charge
do
look
to
all
these
things
yourself
those
under
you
will
be
more
careful
than
you
are
it
appears
as
if
the
part
of
a
mistress
now
is
to
complain
of
her
servants
and
to
accept
their
excuses
not
to
show
them
how
there
need
be
neither
complaints
made
nor
excuses
sidenote
head
in
charge
must
see
to
house
hygiene
not
do
it
herself
but
again
to
look
to
all
these
things
yourself
does
not
mean
to
do
them
yourself
i
always
open
the
windows
the
head
in
charge
often
says
if
you
do
it
it
is
by
so
much
the
better
certainly
than
if
it
were
not
done
at
all
but
can
you
not
insure
that
it
is
done
when
not
done
by
yourself
can
you
insure
that
it
is
not
undone
when
your
back
is
turned
this
is
what
being
in
charge
means
and
a
very
important
meaning
it
is
too
the
former
only
implies
that
just
what
you
can
do
with
your
own
hands
is
done
the
latter
that
what
ought
to
be
done
is
always
done
sidenote
does
god
think
of
these
things
so
seriously
and
now
you
think
these
things
trifles
or
at
least
exaggerated
but
what
you
think
or
what
i
think
matters
little
let
us
see
what
god
thinks
of
them
god
always
justifies
his
ways
while
we
are
thinking
he
has
been
teaching
i
have
known
cases
of
hospital
pyæmia
quite
as
severe
in
handsome
private
houses
as
in
any
of
the
worst
hospitals
and
from
the
same
cause
foul
air
yet
nobody
learnt
the
lesson
nobody
learnt
at
all
from
it
they
went
on
thinking
that
the
sufferer
had
scratched
his
thumb
or
that
it
was
singular
that
all
the
servants
had
whitlows
or
that
something
was
much
about
this
year
there
is
always
sickness
in
our
house
this
is
a
favourite
mode
of
thought
leading
to
inquire
what
is
the
uniform
cause
of
these
general
whitlows
but
to
stifle
all
inquiry
in
what
sense
is
sickness
being
always
there
a
justification
of
its
being
there
at
all
sidenote
how
does
he
carry
out
his
laws
sidenote
how
does
he
teach
his
laws
i
will
tell
you
what
was
the
cause
of
this
hospital
pyæmia
being
in
that
large
private
house
it
was
that
the
sewer
air
from
an
sink
was
carefully
conducted
into
all
the
rooms
by
sedulously
opening
all
the
doors
and
closing
all
the
passage
windows
it
was
that
the
slops
were
emptied
into
the
foot
pans
it
was
that
the
utensils
were
never
properly
rinsed
it
was
that
the
chamber
crockery
was
rinsed
with
dirty
water
it
was
that
the
beds
were
never
properly
shaken
aired
picked
to
pieces
or
changed
it
was
that
the
carpets
and
curtains
were
always
musty
it
was
that
the
furniture
was
always
dusty
it
was
that
the
papered
walls
were
saturated
with
dirt
it
was
that
the
floors
were
never
cleaned
it
was
that
the
uninhabited
rooms
were
never
sunned
or
cleaned
or
aired
it
was
that
the
cupboards
were
always
reservoirs
of
foul
air
it
was
that
the
windows
were
always
tight
shut
up
at
night
it
was
that
no
window
was
ever
systematically
opened
even
in
the
day
or
that
the
right
window
was
not
opened
a
person
gasping
for
air
might
open
a
window
for
himself
but
the
servants
were
not
taught
to
open
the
windows
to
shut
the
doors
or
they
opened
the
windows
upon
a
dank
well
between
high
walls
not
upon
the
airier
court
or
they
opened
the
room
doors
into
the
unaired
halls
and
passages
by
way
of
airing
the
rooms
now
all
this
is
not
fancy
but
fact
in
that
handsome
house
i
have
known
in
one
summer
three
cases
of
hospital
pyæmia
one
of
phlebitis
two
of
consumptive
cough
all
the
products
of
foul
air
when
in
temperate
climates
a
house
is
more
unhealthy
in
summer
than
in
winter
it
is
a
certain
sign
of
something
wrong
yet
nobody
learns
the
lesson

always
justifies
his

is
teaching
while
you
are
not
learning

poor

one
loses
his

all
from
the
most
easily
preventible
causes
sidenote
physical
degeneration
in

its
causes
the
houses
of
the

and
great
grandmothers
of
this
generation
at
least
the
country
houses
with
front
door
and
back
door
always
standing
open
winter
and
summer
and
a
thorough
draught
always
blowing
through
with
all
the
scrubbing
and
cleaning
and
polishing
and
scouring
which
used
to
go
on
the
grandmothers
and
still
more
the
great
grandmothers
always
out
of
doors
and
never
with
a
bonnet
on
except
to
go
to
church
these
things
entirely
account
for
the
fact
so
often
seen
of
a
great
grandmother
who
was
a
tower
of
physical
vigour
descending
into
a
grandmother
perhaps
a
little
less
vigorous
but
still
sound
as
a
bell
and
healthy
to
the
core
into
a
mother
languid
and
confined
to
her
carriage
and
house
and
lastly
into
a
daughter
sickly
and
confined
to
her
bed
for
remember
even
with
a
general
decrease
of
mortality
you
may
often
find
a
race
thus
degenerating
and
still
oftener
a
family
you
may
see
poor
little
feeble
rags
children
of
a
noble
stock
suffering
morally
and
physically
throughout
their
useless
degenerate
lives
and
yet
people
who
are
going
to
marry
and
to
bring
more
such
into
the
world
will
consult
nothing
but
their
own
convenience
as
to
where
they
are
to
live
or
how
they
are
to
live
sidenote
do
make
your
into
a
ventilating
shaft
for
the
whole
house
with
regard
to
the
health
of
houses
where
there
is
a
sick
person
it
often
happens
that
the
sick
room
is
made
a
ventilating
shaft
for
the
rest
of
the
house
for
while
the
house
is
kept
as
close
unaired
and
dirty
as
usual
the
window
of
the
sick
room
is
kept
a
little
open
always
and
the
door
occasionally
now
there
are
certain
sacrifices
which
a
house
with
one
sick
person
in
it
does
make
to
that
sick
person
it
ties
up
its
knocker
it
lays
straw
before
it
in
the
street
why
it
keep
itself
thoroughly
clean
and
unusually
well
aired
in
deference
to
the
sick
person
sidenote
infection
we
must
not
forget
what
in
ordinary
language
is
called
infection
a
thing
of
which
people
are
generally
so
afraid
that
they
frequently
follow
the
very
practice
in
regard
to
it
which
they
ought
to
avoid
nothing
used
to
be
considered
so
infectious
or
contagious
as
small
pox
and
people
not
very
long
ago
used
to
cover
up
patients
with
heavy
bed
clothes
while
they
kept
up
large
fires
and
shut
the
windows
small
pox
of
course
under
this
is
very
infectious
people
are
somewhat
wiser
now
in
their
management
of
this
disease
they
have
ventured
to
cover
the
patients
lightly
and
to
keep
the
windows
open
and
we
hear
much
less
of
the
infection
of
small
pox
than
we
used
to
do
but
do
people
in
our
days
act
with
more
wisdom
on
the
subject
of
infection
in
fevers
scarlet
fever
measles
than
their
forefathers
did
with
small
pox
does
not
the
popular
idea
of
infection
involve
that
people
should
take
greater
care
of
themselves
than
of
the
patient
that
for
instance
it
is
safer
not
to
be
too
much
with
the
patient
not
to
attend
too
much
to
his
wants
perhaps
the
best
illustration
of
the
utter
absurdity
of
this
view
of
duty
in
attending
on
infectious
diseases
is
afforded
by
what
was
very
recently
the
practice
if
it
is
not
so
even
now
in
some
of
the
european
lazarets
in
which
the
used
to
be
condemned
to
the
horrors
of
filth
overcrowding
and
want
of
ventilation
while
the
medical
attendant
was
ordered
to
examine
the
patient
tongue
through
an
and
to
toss
him
a
lancet
to
open
his
abscesses
with
true
nursing
ignores
infection
except
to
prevent
it
cleanliness
and
fresh
air
from
open
windows
with
unremitting
attention
to
the
patient
are
the
only
defence
a
true
nurse
either
asks
or
needs
wise
and
humane
management
of
the
patient
is
the
best
safeguard
against
infection
sidenote
why
must
children
have
measles
there
are
not
a
few
popular
opinions
in
regard
to
which
it
is
useful
at
times
to
ask
a
question
or
two
for
example
it
is
commonly
thought
that
children
must
have
what
are
commonly
called
children
epidemics
current
contagions
in
other
words
that
they
are
born
to
have
measles
perhaps
even
scarlet
fever
just
as
they
are
born
to
cut
their
teeth
if
they
live
now
do
tell
us
why
must
a
child
have
measles
oh
because
you
say
we
can
not
keep
it
from
infection
other
children
have
measles
and
it
must
take
them
and
it
is
safer
that
it
should
but
why
must
other
children
have
measles
and
if
they
have
why
must
yours
have
them
too
if
you
believed
in
and
observed
the
laws
for
preserving
the
health
of
houses
which
inculcate
cleanliness
ventilation
and
other
means
and
which
by
the
way
as
implicitly
as
you
believe
in
the
popular
opinion
for
it
is
nothing
more
than
an
opinion
that
your
child
must
have
children
epidemics
do
you
think
that
upon
the
whole
your
child
would
be
more
likely
to
escape
altogether

measures
for
being
in
the
way
yourself
only
increase
the
necessity
for
his
thought
whereas
if
you
could
but
arrange
that
the
thing
should
always
be
done
whether
you
are
there
or
not
he
need
never
think
at
all
about
it
for
the
above
reasons
whatever
a
patient
do
for
himself
it
is
better
less
anxiety
for
him
to
do
for
himself
unless
the
person
in
charge
has
the
spirit
of
management
it
is
evidently
much
less
exertion
for
a
patient
to
answer
a
letter
for
himself
by
return
of
post
than
to
have
four
conversations
wait
five
days
have
six
anxieties
before
it
is
off
his
mind
before
the
person
who
is
to
answer
it
has
done
so
apprehension
uncertainty
waiting
expectation
fear
of
surprise
do
a
patient
more
harm
than
any
exertion
remember
he
is
face
to
face
with
his
enemy
all
the
time
internally
wrestling
with
him
having
long
imaginary
conversations
with
him
you
are
thinking
of
something
else
rid
him
of
his
adversary
quickly
is
a
first
rule
with
the
sick
for
the
same
reasons
always
tell
a
patient
and
tell
him
beforehand
when
you
are
going
out
and
when
you
will
be
back
whether
it
is
for
a
day
an
hour
or
ten
minutes
you
fancy
perhaps
that
it
is
better
for
him
if
he
does
not
find
out
your
going
at
all
better
for
him
if
you
do
not
make
yourself
of
too
much
importance
to
him
or
else
you
can
not
bear
to
give
him
the
pain
or
the
anxiety
of
the
temporary
separation
no
such
thing
you
to
go
we
will
suppose
health
or
duty
requires
it
then
say
so
to
the
patient
openly
if
you
go
without
his
knowing
it
and
he
finds
it
out
he
never
will
feel
secure
again
that
the
things
which
depend
upon
you
will
be
done
when
you
are
away
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
he
will
be
right
if
you
go
out
without
telling
him
when
you
will
be
back
he
can
take
no
measures
nor
precautions
as
to
the
things
which
concern
you
both
or
which
you
do
for
him
sidenote
what
is
the
cause
of
half
the
accidents
which
happen
if
you
look
into
the
reports
of
trials
or
accidents
and
especially
of
suicides
or
into
the
medical
history
of
fatal
cases
it
is
almost
incredible
how
often
the
whole
thing
turns
upon
something
which
has
happened
because
he
or
still
oftener
she
was
not
there
but
it
is
still
more
incredible
how
often
how
almost
always
this
is
accepted
as
a
sufficient
reason
a
justification
why
the
very
fact
of
the
thing
having
happened
is
the
proof
of
its
not
being
a
justification
the
person
in
charge
was
quite
right
not
to
be
he
was
called
away
for
quite
sufficient
reason
or
he
was
away
for
a
daily
recurring
and
unavoidable
cause
yet
no
provision
was
made
to
supply
his
absence
the
fault
was
not
in
his
being
away
but
in
there
being
no
management
to
supplement
his
being
away
when
the
sun
is
under
a
total
eclipse
or
during
his
nightly
absence
we
light
candles
but
it
would
seem
as
if
it
did
not
occur
to
us
that
we
must
also
supplement
the
person
in
charge
of
sick
or
of
children
whether
under
an
occasional
eclipse
or
during
a
regular
absence
in
institutions
where
many
lives
would
be
lost
and
the
effect
of
such
want
of
management
would
be
terrible
and
patent
there
is
less
of
it
than
in
the
private
house
but
in
both
let
whoever
is
in
charge
keep
this
simple
question
in
her
head
how
can
i
always
do
this
right
thing
myself
but
how
can
i
provide
for
this
right
thing
to
be
always
done
then
when
anything
wrong
has
actually
happened
in
consequence
of
her
absence
which
absence
we
will
suppose
to
have
been
quite
right
let
her
question
still
be
how
can
i
provide
against
any
more
of
such
absences
which
is
neither
possible
nor
desirable
but
how
can
i
provide
against
any
thing
wrong
arising
out
of
my
absence
sidenote
what
it
is
to
be
in
charge
how
few
men
or
even
women
understand
either
in
great
or
in
little
things
what
it
is
the
being
in
charge
i
mean
know
how
to
carry
out
a
charge
from
the
most
colossal
calamities
down
to
the
most
trifling
accidents
results
are
often
traced
or
rather
traced
to
such
want
of
some
one
in
charge
or
of
his
knowing
how
to
be
in
charge
a
short
time
ago
the
bursting
of
a
on
board
the
finest
and
strongest
ship
that
ever
was
built
on
her
trial
trip
destroyed
several
lives
and
put
several
hundreds
in
jeopardy
not
from
any
undetected
flaw
in
her
new
and
untried
works
but
from
a
tap
being
closed
which
ought
not
to
have
been
closed
from
what
every
child
knows
would
make
its
mother
burst
and
this
simply
because
no
one
seemed
to
know
what
it
is
to
be
in
charge
or
was
in
charge
nay
more
the
jury
at
the
inquest
actually
altogether
ignored
the
same
and
apparently
considered
the
tap
in
charge
for
they
gave
as
a
verdict
accidental
death
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
on
a
large
scale
on
a
much
smaller
scale
it
happened
a
short
time
ago
that
an
insane
person
burnt
herself
slowly
and
intentionally
to
death
while
in
her
doctor
charge
and
almost
in
her
nurse
presence
yet
neither
was
considered
at
all
to
blame
the
very
fact
of
the
accident
happening
proves
its
own
case
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
either
they
did
not
know
their
business
or
they
did
not
know
how
to
perform
it
to
be
in
charge
is
certainly
not
only
to
carry
out
the
proper
measures
yourself
but
to
see
that
every
one
else
does
so
too
to
see
that
no
one
either
wilfully
or
ignorantly
thwarts
or
prevents
such
measures
it
is
neither
to
do
everything
yourself
nor
to
appoint
a
number
of
people
to
each
duty
but
to
ensure
that
each
does
that
duty
to
which
he
is
appointed
this
is
the
meaning
which
must
be
attached
to
the
word
by
above
all
those
in
charge
of
sick
whether
of
numbers
or
of
individuals
and
indeed
i
think
it
is
with
individual
sick
that
it
is
least
understood
one
sick
person
is
often
waited
on
by
four
with
less
precision
and
is
really
less
cared
for
than
ten
who
are
waited
on
by
one
or
at
least
than
who
are
waited
on
by
and
all
for
want
of
this
one
person
in
charge
it
is
often
said
that
there
are
few
good
servants
now
i
say
there
are
few
good
mistresses
now
as
the
jury
seems
to
have
thought
the
tap
was
in
charge
of
the
ship
safety
so
mistresses
now
seem
to
think
the
house
is
in
charge
of
itself
they
neither
know
how
to
give
orders
nor
how
to
teach
their
servants
to
obey
orders
to
obey
intelligently
which
is
the
real
meaning
of
all
discipline
again
people
who
are
in
charge
often
seem
to
have
a
pride
in
feeling
that
they
will
be
missed
that
no
one
can
understand
or
carry
on
their
arrangements
their
system
books
accounts
but
themselves
it
seems
to
me
that
the
pride
is
rather
in
carrying
on
a
system
in
keeping
stores
closets
books
accounts
so
that
any
body
can
understand
and
carry
them
on
so
that
in
case
of
absence
or
illness
one
can
deliver
every
thing
up
to
others
and
know
that
all
will
go
on
as
usual
and
that
one
shall
never
be
missed
sidenote
why
hired
nurses
give
so
much
trouble
it
is
often
complained
that
professional
nurses
brought
into
private
families
in
case
of
sickness
make
themselves
intolerable
by
ordering
about
the
other
servants
under
plea
of
not
neglecting
the
patient
both
things
are
true
the
patient
is
often
neglected
and
the
servants
are
often
unfairly
put
upon
but
the
fault
is
generally
in
the
want
of
management
of
the
head
in
charge
it
is
surely
for
her
to
arrange
both
that
the
nurse
place
is
when
necessary
supplemented
and
that
the
patient
is
never
neglected
things
with
a
little
management
quite
compatible
and
indeed
only
attainable
together
it
is
certainly
not
for
the
nurse
to
order
about
the
servants
iv
noise
sidenote
unnecessary
noise
unnecessary
noise
or
noise
that
creates
an
expectation
in
the
mind
is
that
which
hurts
a
patient
it
is
rarely
the
loudness
of
the
noise
the
effect
upon
the
organ
of
the
ear
itself
which
appears
to
affect
the
sick
how
well
a
patient
will
generally
bear
the
putting
up
of
a
scaffolding
close
to
the
house
when
he
can
not
bear
the
talking
still
less
the
whispering
especially
if
it
be
of
a
familiar
voice
outside
his
door
there
are
certain
patients
no
doubt
especially
where
there
is
slight
concussion
or
other
disturbance
of
the
brain
who
are
affected
by
mere
noise
but
intermittent
noise
or
sudden
and
sharp
noise
in
these
as
in
all
other
cases
affects
far
more
than
continuous
noise
noise
with
jar
far
more
than
noise
without
of
one
thing
you
may
be
certain
that
anything
which
wakes
a
patient
suddenly
out
of
his
sleep
will
invariably
put
him
into
a
state
of
greater
excitement
do
him
more
serious
aye
and
lasting
mischief
than
any
continuous
noise
however
loud
sidenote
never
let
a
patient
be
waked
out
of
his
first
sleep
never
to
allow
a
patient
to
be
waked
intentionally
or
accidentally
is
a
quâ
of
all
good
nursing
if
he
is
roused
out
of
his
first
sleep
he
is
almost
certain
to
have
no
more
sleep
it
is
a
curious
but
quite
intelligible
fact
that
if
a
patient
is
waked
after
a
few
instead
of
a
few
minutes
sleep
he
is
much
more
likely
to
sleep
again
because
pain
like
irritability
of
brain
perpetuates
and
intensifies
itself
if
you
have
gained
a
respite
of
either
in
sleep
you
have
gained
more
than
the
mere
respite
both
the
probability
of
recurrence
and
of
the
same
intensity
will
be
diminished
whereas
both
will
be
terribly
increased
by
want
of
sleep
this
is
the
reason
why
sleep
is
so
this
is
the
reason
why
a
patient
waked
in
the
early
part
of
his
sleep
loses
not
only
his
sleep
but
his
power
to
sleep
a
healthy
person
who
allows
himself
to
sleep
during
the
day
will
lose
his
sleep
at
night
but
it
is
exactly
the
reverse
with
the
sick
generally
the
more
they
sleep
the
better
will
they
be
able
to
sleep
sidenote
noise
which
excites
expectation
sidenote
whispered
conversation
in
the
room
i
have
often
been
surprised
at
the
thoughtlessness
resulting
in
cruelty
quite
unintentionally
of
friends
or
of
doctors
who
will
hold
a
long
conversation
just
in
the
room
or
passage
adjoining
to
the
room
of
the
patient
who
is
either
every
moment
expecting
them
to
come
in
or
who
has
just
seen
them
and
knows
they
are
talking
about
him
if
he
is
an
amiable
patient
he
will
try
to
occupy
his
attention
elsewhere
and
not
to
listen
and
this
makes
matters
worse
for
the
strain
upon
his
attention
and
the
effort
he
makes
are
so
great
that
it
is
well
if
he
is
not
worse
for
hours
after
if
it
is
a
whispered
conversation
in
the
same
room
then
it
is
absolutely
cruel
for
it
is
impossible
that
the
patient
attention
should
not
be
involuntarily
strained
to
hear
walking
on
doing
any
thing
in
the
room
very
slowly
are
injurious
for
exactly
the
same
reasons
a
firm
light
quick
step
a
steady
quick
hand
are
the
desiderata
not
the
slow
lingering
shuffling
foot
the
timid
uncertain
touch
slowness
is
not
gentleness
though
it
is
often
mistaken
for
such
quickness
lightness
and
gentleness
are
quite
compatible
again
if
friends
and
doctors
did
but
watch
as
nurses
can
and
should
watch
the
features
sharpening
the
eyes
growing
almost
wild
of
fever
patients
who
are
listening
for
the
entrance
from
the
corridor
of
the
persons
whose
voices
they
are
hearing
there
these
would
never
run
the
risk
again
of
creating
such
expectation
or
irritation
of
such
unnecessary
noise
has
undoubtedly
induced
or
aggravated
delirium
in
many
cases
i
have
known
such
in
one
case
death
ensued
it
is
but
fair
to
say
that
this
death
was
attributed
to
fright
it
was
the
result
of
a
long
whispered
conversation
within
sight
of
the
patient
about
an
impending
operation
but
any
one
who
has
known
the
more
than
stoicism
the
cheerful
coolness
with
which
the
certainty
of
an
operation
will
be
accepted
by
any
patient
capable
of
bearing
an
operation
at
all
if
it
is
properly
communicated
to
him
will
hesitate
to
believe
that
it
was
mere
fear
which
produced
as
was
averred
the
fatal
result
in
this
instance
it
was
rather
the
uncertainty
the
strained
expectation
as
to
what
was
to
be
decided
upon
sidenote
or
just
outside
the
door
i
need
hardly
say
that
the
other
common
cause
namely
for
a
doctor
or
friend
to
leave
the
patient
and
communicate
his
opinion
on
the
result
of
his
visit
to
the
friends
just
outside
the
patient
door
or
in
the
adjoining
room
after
the
visit
but
within
hearing
or
knowledge
of
the
patient
is
if
possible
worst
of
all
sidenote
noise
of
female
dress
it
is
i
think
alarming
peculiarly
at
this
time
when
the
female
are
perpetually
impressing
upon
us
woman
particular
worth
and
general
missionariness
to
see
that
the
dress
of
women
is
daily
more
and
more
unfitting
them
for
any
mission
or
usefulness
at
all
it
is
equally
unfitted
for
all
poetic
and
all
domestic
purposes
a
man
is
now
a
more
handy
and
far
less
objectionable
being
in
a
than
a
woman
compelled
by
her
dress
every
woman
now
either
shuffles
or
waddles

a
man
can
cross
the
floor
of
a
without
shaking
it
what
is
become
of

light
step
the
firm
light
quick
step
we
have
been
asking
for
unnecessary
noise
then
is
the
most
cruel
absence
of
care
which
can
be
inflicted
either
on
sick
or
well
for
in
all
these
remarks
the
sick
are
only
mentioned
as
suffering
in
a
greater
proportion
than
the
well
from
precisely
the
same
causes
unnecessary
although
slight
noise
injures
a
sick
person
much
more
than
necessary
noise
of
a
much
greater
amount
sidenote
patient
repulsion
to
nurses
who
rustle
all
doctrines
about
mysterious
affinities
and
aversions
will
be
found
to
resolve
themselves
very
much
if
not
entirely
into
presence
or
absence
of
care
in
these
things
a
nurse
who
rustles
i
am
speaking
of
nurses
professional
and
unprofessional
is
the
horror
of
a
patient
though
perhaps
he
does
not
know
why
the
fidget
of
silk
and
of
crinoline
the
rattling
of
keys
the
creaking
of
stays
and
of
shoes
will
do
a
patient
more
harm
than
all
the
medicines
in
the
world
will
do
him
good
the
noiseless
step
of
woman
the
noiseless
drapery
of
woman
are
mere
figures
of
speech
in
this
day
her
skirts
and
well
if
they
do
not
throw
down
some
piece
of
furniture
will
at
least
brush
against
every
article
in
the
room
as
she
moves
again
one
nurse
can
not
open
the
door
without
making
everything
rattle
or
she
opens
the
door
unnecessarily
often
for
want
of
remembering
all
the
articles
that
might
be
brought
in
at
once
a
good
nurse
will
always
make
sure
that
no
door
or
window
in
her
patient
room
shall
rattle
or
creak
that
no
blind
or
curtain
shall
by
any
change
of
wind
through
the
open
window
be
made
to
flap
especially
will
she
be
careful
of
all
this
before
she
leaves
her
patients
for
the
night
if
you
wait
till
your
patients
tell
you
or
remind
you
of
these
things
where
is
the
use
of
their
having
a
nurse
there
are
more
shy
than
exacting
patients
in
all
classes
and
many
a
patient
passes
a
bad
night
time
after
time
rather
than
remind
his
nurse
every
night
of
all
the
things
she
has
forgotten

there
are

up

sidenote
hurry
peculiarly
hurtful
to
sick
all
hurry
or
bustle
is
peculiarly
painful
to
the
sick
and
when
a
patient
has
compulsory
occupations
to
engage
him
instead
of
having
simply
to
amuse
himself
it
becomes
doubly
injurious
the
friend
who
remains
standing
and
fidgetting
about
while
a
patient
is
talking
business
to
him
or
the
friend
who
sits
and
proses
the
one
from
an
idea
of
not
letting
the
patient
talk
the
other
from
an
idea
of
amusing
him
each
is
equally
inconsiderate
always
sit
down
when
a
sick
person
is
talking
business
to
you
show
no
signs
of
hurry
give
complete
attention
and
full
consideration
if
your
advice
is
wanted
and
go
away
the
moment
the
subject
is
ended
sidenote
how
to
visit
the
sick
and
not
hurt
them
always
sit
within
the
patient
view
so
that
when
you
speak
to
him
he
has
not
painfully
to
turn
his
head
round
in
order
to
look
at
you
everybody
involuntarily
looks
at
the
person
speaking
if
you
make
this
act
a
wearisome
one
on
the
part
of
the
patient
you
are
doing
him
harm
so
also
if
by
continuing
to
stand
you
make
him
continuously
raise
his
eyes
to
see
you
be
as
motionless
as
possible
and
never
gesticulate
in
speaking
to
the
sick
never
make
a
patient
repeat
a
message
or
request
especially
if
it
be
some
time
after
occupied
patients
are
often
accused
of
doing
too
much
of
their
own
business
they
are
instinctively
right
how
often
you
hear
the
person
charged
with
the
request
of
giving
the
message
or
writing
the
letter
say
half
an
hour
afterwards
to
the
patient
did
you
appoint
or
what
did
you
say
was
the
address
or
ask
perhaps
some
much
more
agitating
question
thus
causing
the
patient
the
effort
of
memory
or
worse
still
of
decision
all
over
again
it
is
really
less
exertion
to
him
to
write
his
letters
himself
this
is
the
almost
universal
experience
of
occupied
invalids
this
brings
us
to
another
caution
never
speak
to
an
invalid
from
behind
nor
from
the
door
nor
from
any
distance
from
him
nor
when
he
is
doing
anything
the
official
politeness
of
servants
in
these
things
is
so
grateful
to
invalids
that
many
prefer
without
knowing
why
having
none
but
servants
about
them
sidenote
these
things
not
fancy
these
things
are
not
fancy
if
we
consider
that
with
sick
as
with
well
every
thought
decomposes
some
nervous
matter
that
decomposition
as
well
as
of
nervous
matter
is
always
going
on
and
more
quickly
with
the
sick
than
with
the
well
that
to
obtrude
abruptly
another
thought
upon
the
brain
while
it
is
in
the
act
of
destroying
nervous
matter
by
thinking
is
calling
upon
it
to
make
a
new
exertion
if
we
consider
these
things
which
are
facts
not
fancies
we
shall
remember
that
we
are
doing
positive
injury
by
interrupting
by
startling
a
fanciful
person
as
it
is
called
alas
it
is
no
fancy
sidenote
interruption
damaging
to
sick
if
the
invalid
is
forced
by
his
avocations
to
continue
occupations
requiring
much
thinking
the
injury
is
doubly
great
in
feeding
a
patient
suffering
under
delirium
or
stupor
you
may
suffocate
him
by
giving
him
his
food
suddenly
but
if
you
rub
his
lips
gently
with
a
spoon
and
thus
attract
his
attention
he
will
swallow
the
food
unconsciously
but
with
perfect
safety
thus
it
is
with
the
brain
if
you
offer
it
a
thought
especially
one
requiring
a
decision
abruptly
you
do
it
a
real
not
fanciful
injury
never
speak
to
a
sick
person
suddenly
but
at
the
same
time
do
not
keep
his
expectation
on
the
tiptoe
sidenote
and
to
well
this
rule
indeed
applies
to
the
well
quite
as
much
as
to
the
sick
i
have
never
known
persons
who
exposed
themselves
for
years
to
constant
interruption
who
did
not
muddle
away
their
intellects
by
it
at
last
the
process
with
them
may
be
accomplished
without
pain
with
the
sick
pain

warning
of
the
injury
sidenote
keeping
a
patient
standing
do
not
meet
or
overtake
a
patient
who
is
moving
about
in
order
to
speak
to
him
or
to
give
him
any
message
or
letter
you
might
just
as
well
give
him
a
box
on
the
ear
i
have
seen
a
patient
fall
flat
on
the
ground
who
was
standing
when
his
nurse
came
into
the
room
this
was
an
accident
which
might
have
happened
to
the
most
careful
nurse
but
the
other
is
done
with
intention
a
patient
in
such
a
state
is
not
going
to
the
east
indies
if
you
would
wait
ten
seconds
or
walk
ten
yards
further
any
promenade
he
could
make
would
be
over
you
do
not
know
the
effort
it
is
to
a
patient
to
remain
standing
for
even
a
quarter
of
a
minute
to
listen
to
you
if
i
had
not
seen
the
thing
done
by
the
kindest
nurses
and
friends
i
should
have
thought
this
caution
quite
superfluous
sidenote
patients
dread
surprise
patients
are
often
accused
of
being
able
to
do
much
more
when
nobody
is
by
it
is
quite
true
that
they
can
unless
nurses
can
be
brought
to
attend
to
considerations
of
the
kind
of
which
we
have
given
here
but
a
few
specimens
a
very
weak
patient
finds
it
really
much
less
exertion
to
do
things
for
himself
than
to
ask
for
them
and
he
will
in
order
to
do
them
very
innocently
and
from
instinct
calculate
the
time
his
nurse
is
likely
to
be
absent
from
a
fear
of
her
coming
in
upon
him
or
speaking
to
him
just
at
the
moment
when
he
finds
it
quite
as
much
as
he
can
do
to
crawl
from
his
bed
to
his
chair
or
from
one
room
to
another
or
down
stairs
or
out
of
doors
for
a
few
minutes
some
extra
call
made
upon
his
attention
at
that
moment
will
quite
upset
him
in
these
cases
you
may
be
sure
that
a
patient
in
the
state
we
have
described
does
not
make
such
exertions
more
than
once
or
twice
and
probably
much
about
the
same
hour
every
day
and
it
is
hard
indeed
if
nurse
and
friends
can
not
calculate
so
as
to
let
him
make
them
undisturbed
remember
that
many
patients
can
walk
who
can
not
stand
or
even
sit
up
standing
is
of
all
positions
the
most
trying
to
a
weak
patient
everything
you
do
in
a
patient
room
after
he
is
put
up
for
the
night
increases
tenfold
the
risk
of
his
having
a
bad
night
but
if
you
rouse
him
up
after
he
has
fallen
asleep
you
do
not
risk
you
secure
him
a
bad
night
one
hint
i
would
give
to
all
who
attend
or
visit
the
sick
to
all
who
have
to
pronounce
an
opinion
upon
sickness
or
its
progress
come
back
and
look
at
your
patient
he
has
had
an
hour
animated
conversation
with
you
it
is
the
best
test
of
his
real
state
we
know
but
never
pronounce
upon
him
from
merely
seeing
what
he
does
or
how
he
looks
during
such
a
conversation
learn
also
carefully
and
exactly
if
you
can
how
he
passed

night
after
it
sidenote
effects
of
on
sick
people
rarely
if
ever
faint
while
making
an
exertion
it
is
after
it
is
over
indeed
almost
every
effect
of
appears
after
not
during
such
exertion
it
is
the
highest
folly
to
judge
of
the
sick
as
is
so
often
done
when
you
see
them
merely
during
a
period
of
excitement
people
have
very
often
died
of
that
which
it
has
been
proclaimed
at
the
time
has
done
them
no
harm
remember
never
to
lean
against
sit
upon
or
unnecessarily
shake
or
even
touch
the
bed
in
which
a
patient
lies
this
is
invariably
a
painful
annoyance
if
you
shake
the
chair
on
which
he
sits
he
has
a
point
by
which
to
steady
himself
in
his
feet
but
on
a
bed
or
sofa
he
is
entirely
at
your
mercy
and
he
feels
every
jar
you
give
him
all
through
him
sidenote
difference
between
real
and
fancy
patients
in
all
that
we
have
said
both
here
and
elsewhere
let
it
be
distinctly
understood
that
we
are
not
speaking
of
hypochondriacs
to
distinguish
between
real
and
fancied
disease
forms
an
important
branch
of
the
education
of
a
nurse
to
manage
fancy
patients
forms
an
important
branch
of
her
duties
but
the
nursing
which
real
and
that
which
fancied
patients
require
is
of
different
or
rather
of
opposite
character
and
the
latter
will
not
be
spoken
of
here
indeed
many
of
the
symptoms
which
are
here
mentioned
are
those
which
distinguish
real
from
fancied
disease
it
is
true
that
hypochondriacs
very
often
do
that
behind
a
nurse
back
which
they
would
not
do
before
her
face
many
such
i
have
had
as
patients
who
scarcely
ate
anything
at
their
regular
meals
but
if
you
concealed
food
for
them
in
a
drawer
they
would
take
it
at
night
or
in
secret
but
this
is
from
quite
a
different
motive
they
do
it
from
the
wish
to
conceal
whereas
the
real
patient
will
often
boast
to
his
nurse
or
doctor
if
these
do
not
shake
their
heads
at
him
of
how
much
he
has
done
or
eaten
or
walked
to
return
to
real
disease
sidenote
conciseness
necessary
with
sick
conciseness
and
decision
are
above
all
things
necessary
with

your
thought
expressed
to
them
be
concisely
and
decidedly
expressed
what
doubt
and
hesitation
there
may
be
in
your
own
mind
must
never
be
communicated
to
theirs
not
even
i
would
rather
say
especially
not
in
little
things
let
your
doubt
be
to
yourself
your
decision
to
them
people
who
think
outside
their
heads
the
whole
process
of
whose
thought
appears
like
homer
in
the
act
of
secretion
who
tell
everything
that
led
them
towards
this
conclusion
and
away
from
that
ought
never
to
be
with
the
sick
sidenote
irresolution
most
painful
to
them
irresolution
is
what
all
patients
most
dread
rather
than
meet
this
in
others
they
will
collect
all
their
data
and
make
up
their
minds
for
themselves
a
change
of
mind
in
others
whether
it
is
regarding
an
operation
or
a
letter
always
injures
the
patient
more
than
the
being
called
upon
to
make
up
his
mind
to
the
most
dreaded
or
difficult
decision
farther
than
this
in
very
many
cases
the
imagination
in
disease
is
far
more
active
and
vivid
than
it
is
in
health
if
you
propose
to
the
patient
change
of
air
to
one
place
one
hour
and
to
another
the
next
he
has
in
each
case
immediately
constituted
himself
in
imagination
the
tenant
of
the
place
gone
over
the
whole
premises
in
idea
and
you
have
tired
him
as
much
by
displacing
his
imagination
as
if
you
had
actually
carried
him
over
both
places
above
all
leave
the
sick
room
quickly
and
come
into
it
quickly
not
suddenly
not
with
a
rush
but
do
let
the
patient
be
wearily
waiting
for
when
you
will
be
out
of
the
room
or
when
you
will
be
in
it
conciseness
and
decision
in
your
movements
as
well
as
your
words
are
necessary
in
the
sick
room
as
necessary
as
absence
of
hurry
and
bustle
to
possess
yourself
entirely
will
ensure
you
from
either
failing
either
loitering
or
hurrying

a
patient
must
not

a
patient
has
to

to
his
own
but
also
to
his
punctuality
or
perseverance
or
readiness
or
calmness
to
any
or
all
of
these
things
he
is
far
better
without

may
otherwise
be

him

sidenote
reading
aloud
with
regard
to
reading
aloud
in
the
sick
room
my
experience
is
that
when
the
sick
are
too
ill
to
read
to
themselves
they
can
seldom
bear
to
be
read
to
children
and
uneducated
persons
are
exceptions
or
where
there
is
any
mechanical
difficulty
in
reading
people
who
like
to
be
read
to
have
generally
not
much
the
matter
with
them
while
in
fevers
or
where
there
is
much
irritability
of
brain
the
effort
of
listening
to
reading
aloud
has
often
brought
on
delirium
i
speak
with
great
diffidence
because
there
is
an
almost
universal
impression
that
it
is
the
sick
to
read
aloud
to
them
but
two
things
are
certain
sidenote
read
aloud
slowly
distinctly
and
steadily
to
the
sick
if
there
is
some
matter
which
be
read
to
a
sick
person
do
it
slowly
people
often
think
that
the
way
to
get
it
over
with
least
fatigue
to
him
is
to
get
it
over
in
least
time
they
gabble
they
plunge
and
gallop
through
the
reading
there
never
was
a
greater
mistake
houdin
the
conjuror
says
that
the
way
to
make
a
story
seem
short
is
to
tell
it
slowly
so
it
is
with
reading
to
the
sick
i
have
often
heard
a
patient
say
to
such
a
mistaken
reader
do
read
it
to
me
tell
it
me
unconsciously
he
is
aware
that
this
will
regulate
the
plunging
the
reading
with
unequal
paces
slurring
over
one
part
instead
of
leaving
it
out
altogether
if
it
is
unimportant
and
mumbling
another
if
the
reader
lets
his
own
attention
wander
and
then
stops
to
read
up
to
himself
or
finds
he
has
read
the
wrong
bit
then
it
is
all
over
with
the
poor
patient
chance
of
not
suffering
very
few
people
know
how
to
read
to
the
sick
very
few
read
aloud
as
pleasantly
even
as
they
speak
in
reading
they
sing
they
hesitate
they
stammer
they
hurry
they
mumble
when
in
speaking
they
do
none
of
these
things
reading
aloud
to
the
sick
ought
always
to
be
rather
slow
and
exceedingly
distinct
but
not
mouthing
rather
monotonous
but
not
sing
song
rather
loud
but
not
noisy
and
above
all
not
too
long
be
very
sure
of
what
your
patient
can
bear
sidenote
never
read
aloud
by
fits
and
starts
to
the
sick
the
extraordinary
habit
of
reading
to
oneself
in
a
sick
room
and
reading
aloud
to
the
patient
any
bits
which
will
amuse
him
or
more
often
the
reader
is
unaccountably
thoughtless
what
you
think

patient
is
thinking
of

your
gaps

that
he
amuses
himself
upon
what
you
have
read
for
precisely
the
time
it

you
to
go
on
reading
to
yourself
and
that
his
attention
is
ready
for
something
else
at
precisely
the
time
it
pleases
you
to
begin

again
whether
the
person
thus
read
to
be

whether
he

nothing
or
doing
something
else
while
being
thus
read
to
the
and
want
of
observation
of
the
person
who
does

equally
difficult
to
understand

very
often
the
is
too
amiable
to
say
how
much
it
disturbs
him
sidenote
people
overhead
one
thing
more
from
the
flimsy
manner
in
which
most
modern
houses
are
built
where
every
step
on
the
stairs
and
along
the
floors
is
felt
all
over
the
house
the
higher

story
the
greater
the
vibration

is
inconceivable

much
the
sick
suffer
by
having
anybody
overhead
in
the
solidly
built
old
houses
which
fortunately
most
hospitals
are
the
noise
and
shaking
is
comparatively
trifling
but
it
is
a
serious
cause
of
suffering
in
lightly
built
houses
and
with
the
irritability
peculiar
to
some
diseases
better
far
put
such
patients
at
the
top
of
the
house
even
with
the
additional
fatigue
of
stairs
if
you
can
not
secure
the
room
above
them
being
untenanted
you
may
otherwise
bring
on
a
state
of
restlessness
which
no
opium
will
subdue
do
not
neglect
the
warning
when
a
patient
tells
you
that
he
feels
every
step
above
him
to
cross
his
heart
remember
that
every
noise
a
patient
can
not
partakes
of
the
character
of
suddenness
to
him
and
i
am
persuaded
that
patients
with
these
peculiarly

any

the

of

upon

been
scarcely
at
all
noticed
in

its
expensiveness
as
it
is
now
makes
any
general
application
of
it
quite
out
of
the
question
i
will
only
remark
here
that
wind

including
the
human

instruments
capable
of

have
generally
a
beneficent
effect
while
the

have

has
just
the
reverse

finest
playing
will
damage
the

while
an
air
like
home
sweet

or
assisa
a
piè

on
the
most
ordinary
grinding
organ
will
sensibly
soothe
them

this
quite
independent

a
means
of

to
any
but
an
old

an

would
be
quite
inconceivable
to
which
the
nerves
of
the

suffer
from
seeing
the
same

the
same

the
same

during
a
long
confinement
to
one
or
two
rooms
the
superior
cheerfulness
of
persons
suffering
severe
paroxysms
of
pain
over
that
of
persons
suffering
from
nervous
debility
has
often
been
remarked
upon
and
attributed
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
former
of
their
intervals
of
respite
i
incline
to
think
that
the
majority
of
cheerful
cases
is
to
be
found
among
those
patients
who
are
not
confined
to
one
room
whatever
their
suffering
and
that
the
majority
of
depressed
cases
will
be
seen
among
those
subjected
to
a
long
monotony
of
objects
about
them
the
nervous
frame
really
suffers
as
much
from
this
as
the
digestive
organs
from
long
monotony
of
diet
as
the

from
his

the

in

of

of

of

and
especially
of
brilliancy
of

is
hardly
at
all
appreciated
such
cravings
are
usually
called
the
fancies
of
patients
and
often
doubtless
patients
have
fancies
as
when
they
desire
two
contradictions
but
much
more
often
their
so
called
fancies
are
the
most
valuable
indications
of
what
is
necessary
for
their
recovery
and
it
would
be
well
if
nurses
would
watch
these
so
called
fancies
closely
i
have
seen
in
fevers
and
felt
when
i
was
a
fever
patient
myself
the
most
acute
suffering
produced
from
the
patient
in
a
hut
not
being
able
to
see
out
of
window
and
the
knots
in
the
wood
being
the
only
view
i
shall
never
forget
the
rapture
of
fever

over
a
bunch
of

remember
in
my

a
nosegay
of
wild

being
sent

that
moment

more
rapid

this
is
no

people
say
the

only
on
the
mind
it
is
no
such
thing
the

is
on
the
body
too
little
as
we
know
about
the
way
in
which
we
are

of
colour

the

presented
to

actual

of

it
must
be
variety
if
you
shew
a
patient
ten
or
twelve
engravings
successively
that
he
does
not
become
cold
and
faint
or
feverish
or
even
sick
but
hang

on

not

than
by
this

the

will
leave
the

in
a
corrupting

best
ingredient
of
which
is
carbonic

will
deny
him

the
plea
of

no
one
ever
saw
overcrowding
by

the
carbonic

they
give
off
at
nights
would
not
poison

in

they
actually

intensified
they
become
to
those
who
can
have
no
change

the
very
walls
of
their

rooms
seem
hung
with
their

the
ghosts
of

haunt
their

how
impossible
it
is
for
them
to
escape
from

can
just
as
much
move
his

as
change
his

when
no

is
indeed
one

it
is
an
ever

wonder
to
see
educated
people
who
call
themselves
nurses
acting
thus
they
vary
their
own
objects
their
own
employments
many
times
a
day
and
while
nursing
some
sufferer
they
let
him
lie
there
staring
at
a
dead
wall
without
any
change
of
object
to
enable
him
to
vary
his
thoughts
and
it
never
even
occurs
to
them
at

to
move
his
bed
so
that
he
can
look
out

no
the

is
to
be
always
left
in
the
darkest
dullest
remotest
part
of

i
think
it
is
a
very
common
error
among
the
well
to
think
that
with
a
little
more
the
sick
might
if
they
choose

aggravate
their

this

of

is
most
frequently
to
be

by

in
affording

a

itself
will
often
relieve
it
the

for
the

which
the

so
constantly
evince
is
generally
nothing
but
the
desire
for

remembrance
of
the
relief
which
a

of

to
the

has
some

excepting
a

fine

who
do
not
even

themselves
and
who
are
virtually
in
the
same
category
as
to
nerves
as
the
sick
now
you
can
have
no
idea
of
the
relief
which
manual
labour
is
to
you
of
the
degree
to
which
the
deprivation
of
manual
employment
increases
the
peculiar
irritability
from
which
many
sick
suffer
a
little
a
little
writing
a
little
cleaning
would
be
the
greatest
relief
the
sick
could
have
if
they
could
do
it
these
the
greatest
relief
to
you
though
you
do
not
know
it
reading
though
it
is
often
the
only
thing
the
sick
can
do
is
not
this
relief
bearing
this
in

bearing
in
mind
that
you
have
all
these
varieties
of
employment
which
the
sick
can
not
have

also
in
mind
to
obtain
for
them
all
the
varieties
which
they
can
enjoy
i
need
hardly
say
that
i
am
well
aware
that
excess
in
in
writing
in
any
other
continuous
employment
will
produce
the
same
irritability
that
defect
in
manual
employment
as
one
cause
produces
in
the
sick
vi
taking
food
sidenote
want
of
attention
to
hours
of
taking
food
every
careful
observer
of
the
sick
will
agree
in
this
that
thousands
of
patients
are
annually
starved
in
the
midst
of
plenty
from
want
of
attention
to
the
ways
which
alone
make
it
possible
for
them
to
take
food
this
want
of
attention
is
as
remarkable
in
those
who
urge
upon
the
sick
to
do
what
is
quite
impossible
to
them
as
in
the
sick
themselves
who
will
not
make
the
effort
to
do
what
is
perfectly
possible
to
them
for
instance
to
the
large
majority
of
very
weak
patients
it
is
quite
impossible
to
take
any
solid
food
before
nor
then
if
their
strength
is
still
further
exhausted
by
fasting
till
that
hour
for
weak
patients
have
generally
feverish
nights
and
in
the
morning
dry
mouths
and
if
they
could
eat
with
those
dry
mouths
it
would
be
the
worse
for
them
a
spoonful
of
of
arrowroot
and
wine
of
egg
flip
every
hour
will
give
them
the
requisite
nourishment
and
prevent
them
from
being
too
much
exhausted
to
take
at
a
later
hour
the
solid
food
which
is
necessary
for
their
recovery
and
every
patient
who
can
swallow
at
all
can
swallow
these
liquid
things
if
he
chooses
but
how
often
do
we
hear
a
an
egg
a
bit
of
bacon
ordered
to
a
patient
for
breakfast
to
whom
as
a
moment
consideration
would
show
us
it
must
be
quite
impossible
to
masticate
such
things
at
that
hour
again
a
nurse
is
ordered
to
give
a
patient
a
full
of
some
article
of
food
every
three
hours
the
patient
stomach
rejects
it
if
so
try
a
full
every
hour
if
this
will
not
do
a
full
every
quarter
of
an
hour
i
am
bound
to
say
that
i
think
more
patients
are
lost
by
want
of
care
and
ingenuity
in
these
momentous
minutiæ
in
private
nursing
than
in
public
hospitals
and
i
think
there
is
more
of
the
to
assist
one
another
hands
between
the
doctor
and
his
head
nurse
in
the
latter
institutions
than
between
the
doctor
and
the
patient
friends
in
the
private
house
sidenote
life
often
hangs
upon
minutes
in
taking
food
if
we
did
but
know
the
consequences
which
may
ensue
in
very
weak
patients
from
ten
minutes
fasting
or
repletion
i
call
it
repletion
when
they
are
obliged
to
let
too
small
an
interval
elapse
between
taking
food
and
some
other
exertion
owing
to
the
unpunctuality
we
should
be
more
careful
never
to
let
this
occur
in
very
weak
patients
there
is
often
a
nervous
difficulty
of
swallowing
which
is
so
much
increased
by
any
other
call
upon
their
strength
that
unless
they
have
their
food
punctually
at
the
minute
which
minute
again
must
be
arranged
so
as
to
fall
in
with
no
other
minute
occupation
they
can
take
nothing
till
the
next
respite
occurs
so
that
an
unpunctuality
or
delay
of
ten
minutes
may
very
well
turn
out
to
be
one
of
two
or
three
hours
and
why
is
it
not
as
easy
to
be
punctual
to
a
minute
life
often
literally
hangs
upon
these
minutes
in
acute
cases
where
life
or
death
is
to
be
determined
in
a
few
hours
these
matters
are
very
generally
attended
to
especially
in
hospitals
and
the
number
of
cases
is
large
where
the
patient
is
as
it
were
brought
back
to
life
by
exceeding
care
on
the
part
of
the
doctor
or
nurse
or
both
in
ordering
and
giving
nourishment
with
minute
selection
and
punctuality
sidenote
patients
often
starved
to
death
in
chronic
cases
but
in
chronic
cases
lasting
over
months
and
years
where
the
fatal
issue
is
often
determined
at
last
by
mere
protracted
starvation
i
had
rather
not
enumerate
the
instances
which
i
have
known
where
a
little
ingenuity
and
a
great
deal
of
perseverance
might
in
all
probability
have
averted
the
result
the
consulting
the
hours
when
the
patient
can
take
food
the
observation
of
the
times
often
varying
when
he
is
most
faint
the
altering
seasons
of
taking
food
in
order
to
anticipate
and
prevent
such
times
all
this
which
requires
observation
ingenuity
and
perseverance
and
these
really
constitute
the
good
nurse
might
save
more
lives
than
we
wot
of
sidenote
food
never
to
be
left
by
the
patient
side
to
leave
the
patient
untasted
food
by
his
side
from
meal
to
meal
in
hopes
that
he
will
eat
it
in
the
interval
is
simply
to
prevent
him
from
taking
any
food
at
all
i
have
known
patients
literally
incapacitated
from
taking
one
article
of
food
after
another
by
this
piece
of
ignorance
let
the
food
come
at
the
right
time
and
be
taken
away
eaten
or
uneaten
at
the
right
time
but
never
let
a
patient
have
something
always
standing
by
him
if
you
do
wish
to
disgust
him
of
everything
on
the
other
hand
i
have
known
a
patient
life
saved
he
was
sinking
for
want
of
food
by
the
simple
question
put
to
him
by
the
doctor
but
is
there
no
hour
when
you
feel
you
could
eat
oh
yes
he
said
i
could
always
take
something
at
and
the
thing
was
tried
and
succeeded
patients
very
seldom
however
can
tell
this
it
is
for
you
to
watch
and
find
it
out
sidenote
patient
had
better
not
see
more
food
than
his
own
a
patient
should
if
possible
not
see
or
smell
either
the
food
of
others
or
a
greater
amount
of
food
than
he
himself
can
consume
at
one
time
or
even
hear
food
talked
about
or
see
it
in
the
raw
state
i
know
of
no
exception
to
the
above
rule
the
breaking
of
it
always
induces
a
greater
or
less
incapacity
of
taking
food
in
hospital
wards
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
observe
all
this
and
in
single
wards
where
a
patient
must
be
continuously
and
closely
watched
it
is
frequently
impossible
to
relieve
the
attendant
so
that
his
or
her
own
meals
can
be
taken
out
of
the
ward
but
it
is
not
the
less
true
that
in
such
cases
even
where
the
patient
is
not
himself
aware
of
it
his
possibility
of
taking
food
is
limited
by
seeing
the
attendant
eating
meals
under
his
observation
in
some
cases
the
sick
are
aware
of
it
and
complain
a
case
where
the
patient
was
supposed
to
be
insensible
but
complained
as
soon
as
able
to
speak
is
now
present
to
my
recollection
remember
however
that
the
extreme
punctuality
in
hospitals
the
rule
that
nothing
shall
be
done
in
the
ward
while
the
patients
are
having
their
meals
go
far
to
counterbalance
what
unavoidable
evil
there
is
in
having
patients
together
i
have
often
seen
the
private
nurse
go
on
dusting
or
fidgeting
about
in
a
sick
room
all
the
while
the
patient
is
eating
or
trying
to
eat
that
the
more
alone
an
invalid
can
be
when
taking
food
the
better
is
unquestionable
and
even
if
he
must
be
fed
the
nurse
should
not
allow
him
to
talk
or
talk
to
him
especially
about
food
while
eating
when
a
person
is
compelled
by
the
pressure
of
occupation
to
continue
his
business
while
sick
it
ought
to
be
a
rule
without
any
exception
whatever
that
no
one
shall
bring
business
to
him
or
talk
to
him
while
he
is
taking
food
nor
go
on
talking
to
him
on
interesting
subjects
up
to
the
last
moment
before

that
there

observance
of
these
rules
especially
the
first
often
depends
the
patient
capability
of
taking
food
at
all
or
if
he
is
amiable
and
forces
himself
to
take

deriving
any

from
it
sidenote
you
can
not
be
too
careful
as
to
quality
in
sick
diet
a
nurse
should
never
put
before
a
patient
milk
that
is
sour
meat
or
soup
that
is
turned
an
egg
that
is
bad
or
vegetables
underdone
yet
often
i
have
seen
these
things
brought
in
to
the
sick
in
a
state
perfectly
perceptible
to
every
nose
or
eye
except
the
nurse
it
is
here
that
the
clever
nurse
appears
she
will
not
bring
in
the
peccant
article
but
not
to
disappoint
the
patient
she
will
whip
up
something
else
in
a
few
minutes
remember
that
sick
cookery
should
half
do
the
work
of
your
poor
patient
weak
digestion
but
if
you
further
impair
it
with
your
bad
articles
i
know
not
what
is
to
become
of
him
or
of
it
if
the
nurse
is
an
intelligent
being
and
not
a
mere
carrier
of
diets
to
and
from
the
patient
let
her
exercise
her
intelligence
in
these
things
how
often
we
have
known
a
patient
eat
nothing
at
all
in
the
day
because
one
meal
was
left
untasted
at
that
time
he
was
incapable
of
eating
at
another
the
milk
was
sour
the
third
was
spoiled
by
some
other
accident
and
it
never
occurred
to
the
nurse
to
extemporize
some
expedient
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
as
he
had
had
no
solid
food
that
day
he
might
eat
a
bit
of
toast
say
with
his
tea
in
the
evening
or
he
might
have
some
meal
an
hour
earlier
a
patient
who
can
not
touch
his
dinner
at
two
will
often
accept
it
gladly
if
brought
to
him
at
seven
but
somehow
nurses
never
think
of
these
things
one
would
imagine
they
did
not
consider
themselves
bound
to
exercise
their
judgment
they
leave
it
to
the
patient
now
i
am
quite
sure
that
it
is
better
for
a
patient
rather
to
suffer
these
neglects
than
to
try
to
teach
his
nurse
to
nurse
him
if
she
does
not
know
how
it
ruffles
him
and
if
he
is
ill
he
is
in
no
condition
to
teach
especially
upon
himself
the
above
remarks
apply
much
more
to
private
nursing
than
to
hospitals

i
would
say
to
the

have
a
rule
of
thought
about
your
diet

how
much
he
has
had
and
how
much
he
ought
to
have
generally
the
only
rule
of
the
private
patient
diet
is
what
the
nurse
has
to
give
it
is
true
she
can
not
give
him
what
she
has
not
got
but
his
stomach
does
not
wait
for
her
convenience
or
even
her
necessity
if
it
is
used
to
having
its
stimulus
at
one
hour
and
it
does
not
have
it
because
she
has
failed
in
getting
it

will

she
must
be
always
exercising
her
ingenuity
to
supply
defects
and
to
remedy
accidents
which
will
happen
among
the
best
contrivers
but
from
which
the
patient
does
not
suffer
the
less
because

sidenote
common
errors
in
diet
sidenote
beef
tea
sidenote
eggs
sidenote
meat
without
vegetables
sidenote
arrowroot
i
will
mention
one
or
two
of
the
most
common
errors
among
women
in
charge
of
sick
respecting
sick
diet
one
is
the
belief
that
beef
tea
is
the
most
nutritive
of
all
articles
now
just
try
and
boil
down
a
lb
of
beef
into
beef
tea
evaporate
your
beef
tea
and
see
what
is
left
of
your
beef
you
will
find
that
there
is
barely
a
teaspoonful
of
solid
nourishment
to
half
a
pint
of
water
in
beef
tea
nevertheless
there
is
a
certain
reparative
quality
in
it
we
do
not
know
what
as
there
is
in
tea
but
it
may
safely
be
given
in
almost
any
inflammatory
disease
and
is
as
little
to
be
depended
upon
with
the
healthy
or
convalescent
where
much
nourishment
is
required
again
it
is
an
ever
ready
saw
that
an
egg
is
equivalent
to
a
lb
of
meat
whereas
it
is
not
at
all
so
also
it
is
seldom
noticed
with
how
many
patients
particularly
of
nervous
or
bilious
temperament
eggs
disagree
all
puddings
made
with
eggs
are
distasteful
to
them
in
consequence
an
egg
whipped
up
with
wine
is
often
the
only
form
in
which
they
can
take
this
kind
of
nourishment
again
if
the
patient
has
attained
to
eating
meat
it
is
supposed
that
to
give
him
meat
is
the
only
thing
needful
for
his
recovery
whereas
scorbutic
sores
have
been
actually
known
to
appear
among
sick
persons
living
in
the
midst
of
plenty
in
england
which
could
be
traced
to
no
other
source
than
this
viz
that
the
nurse
depending
on
meat
alone
had
allowed
the
patient
to
be
without
vegetables
for
a
considerable
time
these
latter
being
so
badly
cooked
that
he
always
left
them
untouched
arrowroot
is
another
grand
dependence
of
the
nurse
as
a
vehicle
for
wine
and
as
a
restorative
quickly
prepared
it
is
all
very
well
but
it
is
nothing
but
starch
and
water
flour
is
both
more
nutritive
and
less
liable
to
ferment
and
is
preferable
wherever
it
can
be
used
sidenote
milk
butter
cream
again
milk
and
the
preparations
from
milk
are
a
most
important
article
of
food
for
the
sick
butter
is
the
lightest
kind
of
animal
fat
and
though
it
wants
the
sugar
and
some
of
the
other
elements
which
there
are
in
milk
yet
it
is
most
valuable
both
in
itself
and
in
enabling
the
patient
to
eat
more
bread
flour
oats
groats
barley
and
their
kind
are
as
we
have
already
said
preferable
in
all
their
preparations
to
all
the
preparations
of

sago

and
their
kind
cream
in
many
long
chronic
diseases
is
quite
irreplaceable
by
any
other
article
whatever
it
seems
to
act
in
the
same
manner
as
beef
tea
and
to
most
it
is
much
easier
of
digestion
than
milk
in
fact
it
seldom
disagrees
cheese
is
not
usually
digestible
by
the
sick
but
it
is
pure
nourishment
for
repairing
waste
and
i
have
seen
sick
and
not
a
few
either
whose
craving
for
cheese
shewed
how
much
it
was
needed
by
them
but
if
fresh
milk
is
so
valuable
a
food
for
the
sick
the
least
change
or
sourness
in
it
makes
it
of
all
articles
perhaps
the
most
injurious
diarrhoea
is
a
common
result
of
fresh
milk
allowed
to
become
at
all
sour
the
nurse
therefore
ought
to
exercise
her
utmost
care
in
this
in
large
institutions
for
the
sick
even
the
poorest
the
utmost
care
is
exercised
wenham
lake
ice
is
used
for
this
express
purpose
every
summer
while
the
private
patient
perhaps
never
tastes
a
drop
of
milk
that
is
not
sour
all
through
the
hot
weather
so
little
does
the
private
nurse
understand
the
necessity
of
such
care
yet
if
you
consider
that
the
only
drop
of
real
nourishment
in
your
patient
tea
is
the
drop
of
milk
and
how
much
almost
all
english
patients
depend
upon
their
tea
you
will
see
the
great
importance
of
not
depriving
your
patient
of
this
drop
of
milk
buttermilk
a
totally
different
thing
is
often
very
useful

in

sugar
is
one
of
the

of

being
pure

the

of

in

young

male

rich

dislike
sweet

and
while
i
have
never
known
a
person
take
to
sweets
when
he
was
ill
who
disliked
them
when
he
was
well
i
have
known
many
fond
of
them
when
in
health
who
in
sickness
would
leave
off
anything
sweet
even
to
sugar
in

sweet
puddings
sweet

are
their

the

jelly
jelly
is
another
article
of
diet
in
great
favour
with
nurses
and
friends
of
the
sick
even
if
it
could
be
eaten
solid
it
would
not
nourish
but
it
is
simply
the
height
of
folly
to
take
oz
of
gelatine
and
make
it
into
a
certain
bulk
by
dissolving
it
in
water
and
then
to
give
it
to
the
sick
as
if
the
mere
bulk
represented
nourishment
it
is
now
known
that
jelly
does
not
nourish
that
it
has
a
tendency
to
produce
diarrhoea
and
to
trust
to
it
to
repair
the
waste
of
a
diseased
constitution
is
simply
to
starve
the
sick
under
the
guise
of
feeding
them
if
spoonfuls
of
jelly
were
given
in
the
course
of
the
day
you
would
have
given
one
spoonful
of
gelatine
which
spoonful
has
no
nutritive
power
whatever
and
nevertheless
gelatine
contains
a
large
quantity
of
nitrogen
which
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
elements
in
nutrition
on
the
other
hand
beef
tea
may
be
chosen
as
an
illustration
of
great
nutrient
power
in
sickness
with
a
very
small
amount
of
solid
nitrogenous
matter
sidenote
beef
tea
christison
says
that
every
one
will
be
struck
with
the
readiness
with
which
certain
classes
of
patients
will
often
take
diluted
meat
juice
or
beef
tea
repeatedly
when
they
refuse
all
other
kinds
of
food
this
is
particularly
remarkable
in
cases
of
gastric
fever
in
which
he
says
little
or
nothing
else
besides
beef
tea
or
diluted
meat
juice
has
been
taken
for
weeks
or
even
months
and
yet
a
pint
of
beef
tea
contains
scarcely
oz
of
anything
but
water
the
result
is
so
striking
that
he
asks
what
is
its
mode
of
action
not
simply
nutrient
oz
of
the
most
nutritive
material
can
not
nearly
replace
the
daily
wear
and
tear
of
the
tissues
in
any
circumstances
possibly
he
says
it
belongs
to
a
new
denomination
of
remedies
it
has
been
observed
that
a
small
quantity
of
beef
tea
added
to
other
articles
of
nutrition
augments
their
power
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
additional
amount
of
solid
matter
the
reason
why
jelly
should
be
innutritious
and
beef
tea
nutritious
to
the
sick
is
a
secret
yet
undiscovered

it
clearly
shows
that
careful
observation
of
the

the
only
clue
to
the
best

sick
diet
chemistry
has
as
yet
afforded
little
insight
into
the
dieting
of

all
that
chemistry
can
tell
us
is
the
amount
of
carboniferous
or
nitrogenous
elements
discoverable
in
different
dietetic
articles
it
has
given
us
lists
of
dietetic
substances
arranged
in

order
of
their
richness
in
one
or
other
of
these
principles
but
that
is
all
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
the
stomach
of
the
patient
is
guided
by
other
principles
of
selection
than
merely
the
amount
of
carbon
or
nitrogen
in
the
diet
no
doubt
in
this
as
in
other
things
nature
has
very
definite
rules
for
her
guidance
but
these
rules
can
only
be
ascertained
by
the
most
careful
observation
at
the

there

us
that

the
chemistry
of

is
something
different
from
the

organic
chemistry
is
useful
as
all
knowledge
is
when
we
come
face
to
face
with

it
by

that
we
should

the

as
there
is

the

nearly
the

is
what

can
assimilate

derive

from

known
patients
live
for
many
months
without
touching
bread
because
they
could
not
eat
baker
bread
these
were
mostly
country
patients
but
not
all
bread
or

bread

then
which
the

stomach
gives
rather
than
to
read
analyses
of
foods
is
the
business
of
all
those
who
have
to
settle
what
the
patient
is
to
eat
perhaps
the
most
important
thing
to
be
provided
for
him
after
the
air
he
is
to
breathe
now
the
medical
man
who
sees
the
patient
only
once
a
day
or
even
only
once
or
twice
a
week
can
not
possibly
tell
this
without
the
assistance
of
the
patient
himself
or
of
those
who
are
in
constant
observation
on
the
patient
the
utmost
the
medical
man
can
tell
is
whether
the
patient
is
weaker
or
stronger
at
this
visit
than
he
was
at
the
last
visit
i
should
therefore
say
that
incomparably
the
most
important
office
of
the
nurse
after
she
has
taken
care
of
the
patient
air
is
to
take
care
to
observe
the
effect
of
his
food
and
report
it
to
the
medical
attendant
it
is
quite
incalculable
the
good
that
would
certainly
come
from
such
and
close
observation
in
this
almost
neglected

of
nursing

the

it
would
give

tea
and
coffee
a
great
deal
too
much
against

is
said
by
wise
people
and
a
great
deal
too
much
of
tea
is
given
to
the
sick
by
foolish
people
when
you
see
the
natural
and
almost
universal
craving
in
english
sick
for
their
tea
you
can
not
but
feel
that
nature
knows
what
she
is
about
but
a
little
tea
or
coffee
restores
them
quite
as
much
as
a
great
deal
and
a
great
deal
of
tea
and
especially
of
coffee
impairs
the
little
power
of
digestion
they
have
yet
a
nurse
because
she
sees
how
one
or
two
cups
of
tea
or
coffee
restores
her
patient
thinks
that
three
or
four
cups
will
do
twice

is
not

all
it
is
however
certain
that
there
is
nothing
yet
discovered
which
is
a
substitute
to
the
english
patient
for
his
cup
of
tea
he
can
take
it
when
he
can
take
nothing
else
and
he
often
ca
take
anything
else
if
he
has
it
not
i
should
be
very
glad
if
any
of
the
abusers
of
tea
would
point
out
what
to
give
to
an
english
patient
after
a
sleepless
night
instead
of
tea
if
you
give
it
at
or
in
the
morning
he
may
even
sometimes
fall
asleep
after
it
and
get
perhaps
his
only
two
or
three
hours
sleep
during
the
at
the
same
time
you
never
should
give
tea
or
coffee
to
the
sick
as
a
rule
after
in
the
afternoon
sleeplessness
in
the
early
night
is
from
excitement
generally
and
is
increased
by
tea
or
coffee
sleeplessness
which
continues
to
the
early
morning
is
from
exhaustion
often
and
is
relieved
by
tea
the
only
english
patients
i
have
ever
known
refuse
tea
have
been
typhus
cases
and
the
first
sign
of
their
getting
better
was
their
craving
again
for
tea
in
general
the
dry
and
dirty
tongue
always
prefers
tea
to
coffee
and
will
quite
decline
milk
unless
with
tea
coffee
is
a
better
restorative
than
tea
but
a
greater
impairer
of
the
digestion
let
the
patient
taste
decide
you
will
say
that
in
cases
of
great
thirst
the
patient
craving
decides
that
it
will
drink
great
of
tea
and
that
you
can
not
help
it
but
in
these
cases
be
sure
that
the
patient
requires
diluents
for
quite
other
purposes
than
quenching
the
thirst
he
wants
a
great
deal
of
some
drink
not
only
of
tea
and
the
doctor
will
order
what
he
is
to
have
barley
water
or
lemonade
or
soda
water
and
milk
as
the
case
may
be
lehmann
quoted
by
christison
says
that
among
the
well
and
active
the
infusion
of
oz
of
roasted
coffee
daily
will
diminish
the
waste
going
on
in
the
body
by
and
christison
adds
that
tea
has
the
same
property
now
this
is
actual
experiment
lehmann
weighs
the
man
and
finds
the
fact
from
his
weight
it
is
not
deduced
from
any
analysis
of
food
all
experience
among
the
sick
shows
the
same
thing
sidenote
cocoa
cocoa
is
often
recommended
to
the
sick
in
lieu
of
tea
or
coffee
but
independently
of
the
fact
that
english
sick
very
generally
dislike
cocoa
it
has
quite
a
different
effect
from
tea
or
coffee
it
is
an
oily
starchy
nut
having
no
restorative
power
at
all
but
simply
increasing
fat
it
is
pure
mockery
of
the
sick
therefore
to
call
it
a
substitute
for
tea
for
any
renovating
stimulus
it
has
you
might
just
as
well
offer
them
chesnuts
instead
of
tea
sidenote
bulk
an
almost
universal
error
among
nurses
is
in
the
bulk
of
the
food
and
especially
the
drinks
they
offer
to
their
patients
suppose
a
patient
ordered
oz
brandy
during
the
day
how
is
he
to
take
this
if
you
make
it
into
four
pints
with
diluting
it
the
same
with
tea
and
beef
tea
with
arrowroot
milk
you
have
not
increased
the
nourishment
you
have
not
increased
the
renovating
power
of
these
articles
by
increasing
their
bulk
you
have
very
likely
diminished
both
by
giving
the
patient
digestion
more
to
do
and
most
likely
of
all
the
patient
will
leave
half
of
what
he
has
been
ordered
to
take
because
he
can
not
swallow
the
bulk
with
which
you
have
been
pleased
to
invest
it
it
requires
very
nice
observation
and
care
and
meets
with
hardly
any
to
determine
what
will
not
be
too
thick
or
strong
for
the
patient
to
take
while
giving
him
no
more
than
the
bulk
which
he
is
able
to
swallow

bed
and
bedding
sidenote
feverishness
a
symptom
of
bedding
a
few
words
upon
bedsteads
and
bedding
and
principally
as
regards
patients
who
are
entirely
or
almost
entirely
confined
to
bed
feverishness
is
generally
supposed
to
be
a
symptom
of
fever
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
it
is
a
symptom
of
bedding
the
patient
has
had
into
the
body
the
emanations
from
himself
which
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
saturate
his
unaired
bedding
how
can
it
be
otherwise
look
at
the
ordinary
bed
in
which
a
patient
lies
sidenote
uncleanliness
of
ordinary
bedding
if
i
were
looking
out
for
an
example
in
order
to
show
what
to
do
i
should
take
the
specimen
of
an
ordinary
bed
in
a
private
house
a
wooden
bedstead
two
or
even
three
mattresses
piled
up
to
above
the
height
of
a
table
a
vallance
attached
to
the
frame
nothing
but
a
miracle
could
ever
thoroughly
dry
or
air
such
a
bed
and
bedding
the
patient
must
inevitably
alternate
between
cold
damp
after
his
bed
is
made
and
warm
damp
before
both
saturated
with
organic
matter
and
this
from
the
time
the
mattresses
are
put
under
him
till
the
time
they
are
picked
to
pieces
if
this
is
ever
done
sidenote
air
your
dirty
sheets
not
only
your
clean
ones
if
you
consider
that
an
adult
in
health
exhales
by
the
lungs
and
skin
in
the
hours
three
pints
at
least
of
moisture
loaded
with
organic
matter
ready
to
enter
into
putrefaction
that
in
sickness
the
quantity
is
often
greatly
increased
the
quality
is
always
more
noxious
just
ask
yourself
next
where
does
all
this
moisture
go
to
chiefly
into
the
bedding
because
it
can
not
go
anywhere
else
and
it
stays
there
because
except
perhaps
a
weekly
change
of
sheets
scarcely
any
other
airing
is
attempted
a
nurse
will
be
careful
to
fidgetiness
about
airing
the
clean
sheets
from
clean
damp
but
airing
the
dirty
sheets
from
noxious
damp
will
never
even
occur
to
her
besides
this
the
most
dangerous
effluvia
we
know
of
are
from
the
excreta
of
the
sick
these
are
placed
at
least
temporarily
where
they
must
throw
their
effluvia
into
the
under
side
of
the
bed
and
the
space
under
the
bed
is
never
aired
it
can
not
be
with
our
arrangements
must
not
such
a
bed
be
always
saturated
and
be
always
the
means
of
into
the
system
of
the
unfortunate
patient
who
lies
in
it
that
excrementitious
matter
to
eliminate
which
from
the
body
nature
had
expressly
appointed
the
disease
my
heart
always
sinks
within
me
when
i
hear
the
good
of
every
class
say
i
assure
you
the
bed
has
been
well
slept
in
and
i
can
only
hope
it
is
not
true
what
is
the
bed
already
saturated
with
somebody
else
damp
before
my
patient
comes
to
exhale
into
it
his
own
damp
has
it
not
had
a
single
chance
to
be
aired
no
not

has

every
night
sidenote
iron
spring
bedstead
the
best
sidenote
comfort
and
cleanliness
of
beds
the
only
way
of
really
nursing
a
real
patient
is
to
have
an
bedstead
with
rheocline
springs
which
are
permeable
by
the
air
up
to
the
very
mattress
no
vallance
of
course
the
mattress
to
be
a
thin
hair
one
the
bed
to
be
not
above
feet
wide
if
the
patient
be
entirely
confined
to
his
bed
there
should
be
such
bedsteads
each
bed
to
be
made
with
mattress
sheets
blankets
complete
the
patient
to
pass
twelve
hours
in
each
bed
on
no
account
to
carry
his
sheets
with
him
the
whole
of
the
bedding
to
be
hung
up
to
air
for
each
intermediate
twelve
hours
of
course
there
are
many
cases
where
this
can
not
be
done
at
all
many
more
where
only
an
approach
to
it
can
be
made
i
am
indicating
the
ideal
of
nursing
and
what
i
have
actually
had
done
but
about
the
kind
of
bedstead
there
can
be
no
doubt
whether
there
be
one
or
two
provided
sidenote
bed
not
to
be
too
wide
there
is
a
prejudice
in
favour
of
a
wide
bed
i
believe
it
to
be
a
prejudice
all
the
refreshment
of
moving
a
patient
from
one
side
to
the
other
of
his
bed
is
far
more
effectually
secured
by
putting
him
into
a
fresh
bed
and
a
patient
who
is
really
very
ill
does
not
stray
far
in
bed
but
it
is
said
there
is
no
room
to
put
a
tray
down
on
a
narrow
bed
no
good
nurse
will
ever
put
a
tray
on
a
bed
at
all
if
the
patient
can
turn
on
his
side
he
will
eat
more
comfortably
from
a
table
and
on
no
account
whatever
should
a
bed
ever
be
higher
than
a
sofa
otherwise
the
patient
feels
himself
out
of
humanity
reach
he
can
get
at
nothing
for
himself
he
can
move
nothing
for
himself
if
the
patient
can
not
turn
a
table
over
the
bed
is
a
better
thing
i
need
hardly
say
that
a
patient
bed
should
never
have
its
side
against
the
wall
the
nurse
must
be
able
to
get
easily
to
both
sides
the
bed
and
to
reach
easily
every
part
of
the
patient
without
stretching
a
thing
impossible
if
the
bed
be
either
too
wide
or
too
high
sidenote
bed
not
to
be
too
high
when
i
see
a
patient
in
a
room
nine
or
ten
feet
high
upon
a
bed
between
four
and
five
feet
high
with
his
head
when
he
is
sitting
up
in
bed
actually
within
two
or
three
feet
of
the
ceiling
i
ask
myself
is
this
expressly
planned
to
produce
that
peculiarly
distressing
feeling
common
to
the
sick
as
if
the
walls
and
ceiling
were
closing
in
upon
them
and
they
becoming
sandwiches
between
floor
and
ceiling
which
imagination
is
not
indeed
here
so
far
from
the
truth
if
over
and
above
this
the
window
stops
short
of
the
ceiling
then
the
head
may
literally
be
raised
above
the
stratum
of
fresh
air
even
when
the
window
is
open
can
human
perversity
any
farther
go
in
unmaking
the
process
of
restoration
which
god
has
made
the
fact
is
that
the
heads
of
sleepers
or
of
sick
should
never
be
higher
than
the
throat
of
the
chimney
which
ensures
their
being
in
the
current
of
best
air
and
we
will
not
suppose
it
possible
that
you
have
closed
your
chimney
with
a
if
a
bed
is
higher
than
a
sofa
the
difference
of
the
fatigue
of
getting
in
and
out
of
bed
will
just
make
the
difference
very
often
to
the
patient
who
can
get
in
and
out
of
bed
at
all
of
being
able
to
take
a
few
minutes
exercise
either
in
the
open
air
or
in
another
room
it
is
so
very
odd
that
people
never
think
of
this
or
of
how
many
more
times
a
patient
who
is
in
bed
for
the
hours
is
obliged
to
get
in
and
out
of
bed
than
they
are
who
only
it
is
to
be
hoped
get
into
bed
once
and
out
of

once
during
the
hours

always
be

in
the

and
he
should
be
able
to
see
out
of
window
sidenote
nor
a
four
poster
with
curtains
i
need
scarcely
say
that
the
old
bed
with
curtains
is
utterly
inadmissible
whether
for
sick
or

bedsteads
are
in
many
respects
very
much
less
objectionable
than
private
ones
sidenote
scrofula
often
a
result
of
disposition
of
bedclothes
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
not
a
few
of
the
apparently
unaccountable
cases
of
scrofula
among
children
proceed
from
the
habit
of
sleeping
with
the
head
under
the
bed
clothes
and
so
inhaling
air
already
breathed
which
is
farther
contaminated
by
exhalations
from
the
skin
patients
are
sometimes
given
to
a
similar
habit
and
it
often
happens
that
the
bed
clothes
are
so
disposed
that
the
patient
must
necessarily
breathe
air
more
or
less
contaminated
by
exhalations
from
his
skin
a
good
nurse
will
be
careful
to
attend
to
this
it
is
an
important
part
so
to
speak
of
ventilation
sidenote
bed
sores
it
may
be
worth
while
to
remark
that
where
there
is
any
danger
of
a
blanket
should
never
be
placed

it
retains

and
acts
like
a

never

but
light
witney

as

covering

the
heavy
cotton
impervious
counterpane
is
bad
for
the
very
reason
that
it
keeps
in
the
emanations
from
the
sick
person
while
the
blanket
allows
them
to
pass
through
weak
patients
are
invariably
distressed
by
a
great

which
often
prevents

every

be
his

what
it
may

more
or

from

in

take
the
weight
of
the
body
off
the
poor
chest
which
is
hardly

to
its

it

therefore
to
be
the
object
of
the
nurse
in
arranging
his
pillows
now
what
does
she
do
and
what
are
the
consequences
she
piles
the

one
of
the
other
like
a
wall
of
bricks
the
head
is
thrown
upon
the
chest
and
the
shoulders
are
pushed
forward
so
as
not
to
allow
the
lungs
room
to
expand
the
pillows
in
fact
lean
upon
the
patient
not
the
patient
upon
the
pillows
it
is
impossible
to
give
a
rule
for
this
because
it
must
vary
with
the
figure
of
the
patient
and
tall
patients
suffer
much
more
than
short
ones
because
of
the
of
the
long
limbs
upon
the
waist
but
the
object
is
to
support
with
the
pillows
the
back
the
breathing
apparatus
to
allow
the
shoulders
room
to
fall
back
and
to
support
the
head
without
throwing
it
forward
the
suffering
of
dying
patients
is
immensely
increased
by
neglect
of
these
points
and
many
an
invalid
too
weak
to
drag
about
his
pillows
himself
slips
his
book

anything
at

behind
the

ix
light
sidenote
light
essential
to
both
health
and
recovery
it
is
the
unqualified
result
of
all
my
experience
with
the
sick
that
second
only
to
their
need
of
fresh
air
is
their
need
of
light
that
after
a
close
room
what
hurts
them
most
is
a
dark
room
and
that
it
is
not
only
light
but
direct
they
want
i
had
rather
have
the
power
of
carrying
my
patient
about
after
the
sun
according
to
the
aspect
of
the
rooms
if
circumstances
permit
than
let
him
linger
in
a
room
when
the
sun
is
off
people
think
the
effect
is
upon
the
spirits
only
this
is
by
no
means
the
case
the
sun
is
not
only
a
painter
but
a
sculptor
you
admit
that
he
does
the
photograph
without
going
into
any
scientific
exposition
we
must
admit
that
light
has
quite
as
real
and
tangible
effects
upon
the
human
body
but
this
is
not
all
who
has
not
observed

of

though
the

be
uninhabited
though
the

has
never
been

by

you
will
observe

perhaps
you
can
take

out

and
set
them
by
the

where
they
can

is
if
possible
to
give
them

till
the

he
sets

great
difference
between
the

the
is
that
the

a
very

to
begin
with

he
begins
the

all

he
has
been
breathing
the

it

from
himself
far
more

is
therefore
necessary
to
keep
up

it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
there
are
acute
cases
particularly
a
few
ophthalmic
cases
and
diseases
where
the
eye
is
morbidly
sensitive
where
a
subdued

poisoning
by

skin
in
almost
all
diseases
the
function
of
the
skin
is
more
or
less
disordered
and
in
many
most
important
diseases
nature
relieves
herself
almost
entirely
by
the
skin
this
is
particularly
the
case
with
children
but
the
excretion
which
comes
from
the
skin
is
left
there
unless
removed
by
washing
or
by
the
clothes
every
nurse
should
keep
this
fact
constantly
in
mind
for
if
she
allow
her
sick
to
remain
unwashed
or
their
clothing
to
remain
on
them
after
being
saturated
with
perspiration
or
other
excretion
she
is
interfering
injuriously
with
the
natural
processes
of
health
just
as
effectually
as
if
she
were
to
give
the
patient
a

of

the
amount
of
relief
and

experienced
by
sick
after
the
skin
has
been
carefully
washed
and
dried
is
one
of
the
commonest
observations
made
at
a
sick
bed
but
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
comfort
and
relief
so
obtained
are
not
all
they
are
in
fact
nothing
more
than
a
sign
that
the
vital
powers
have
been
relieved
by
removing
something
that
was
oppressing
them
the
nurse
therefore
must
never
put
off
attending
to
the
personal
cleanliness
of
her
patient
under
the
plea
that
all
that
is
to
be
gained
is
a
little
relief
which
can
be
quite
as
well
given
later
in
all
hospitals
this
ought
to
be
and
generally
is
attended
to
but
it
is
very
generally
neglected
with
private
sick
just
as
it
is

renew
the
air
round

sick
person

carry
off
morbid
effluvia
from
the
lungs
and
skin
by
maintaining
free

so
is
it
necessary
to
keep
the
pores
of
the
skin
free
from
all
obstructing
excretions
the
object
both
of
ventilation
and
of
is
pretty
much
the
same
to
wit
removing
noxious
matter
from
the
system
as
rapidly
as
possible
care
should
be
taken
in
all
these
operations
of
sponging

and
cleansing
the
skin
not
to
expose
too
great
a
surface
at

so
as
to
check
the

would

the
evil

ways

need
not
here

the

ought
to
say

is
to
be

is
that
by
simply
washing
or
sponging
with
water
you
do
not
really
clean
your
skin
take
a
rough
towel
dip
one
corner
in
very
hot
water
if
a
little
spirit
be
added
to
it
it
will
be
more
effectual
and
then
rub
as
if
you
were
rubbing
the
towel
into
your
skin
with
your
fingers
the
black
flakes
which
will
come
off
will
convince
you
that
you
were
not
clean
before
however
much
soap
and
water
you
have
used
these
flakes
are
what
require
removing
and
you
can
really
keep
yourself
cleaner
with
a
tumbler
of
hot
water
and
a
rough
towel
and
rubbing
than
with
a
whole
apparatus
of
bath
and
soap
and
sponge
without
rubbing
it
is
quite
nonsense
to
say
that
anybody
need
be
dirty
patients
have
been
kept
as
clean
by
these
means
on
a
long
voyage
when
a
basin
full
of
water
could
not
be
afforded
and
when
they
could
not
be
moved
out
of
their
berths
as
if
all
the
appurtenances
of
home
had
been
at
hand
washing
however
with
a
large
quantity
of
water
has
quite
other
effects
than
those
of
mere
cleanliness
the
skin
absorbs
the
water
and
becomes
softer
and
more
perspirable
to
wash
with
soap
and
soft
water
is
therefore
desirable
from
other
points
of
view
than
that
of
cleanliness
xii
chattering
hopes
and
advices
sidenote
advising
the
sick
the
sick
man
to
his
advisers
my
advisers
their
name
is
legion
somehow
or
other
it
seems
a
provision
of
the
universal
destinies
that
every
man
woman
and
child
should
consider
him
her
or
itself
privileged
especially
to
advise
me
why
that
is
precisely
what
i
want
to
know
and
this
is
what
i
have
to
say
to
them
i
have
been
advised
to
go
to
every
place
extant
in
and
out
of
england
to
take
every
kind
of
exercise
by
every
kind
of
cart
carriage
yes
and
even
swing
and
in
existence
to
imbibe
every
different
kind
of
stimulus
that
ever
has
been
invented
and
this
when
those
fitted
to
know
medical
men
after
long
and
close
attendance
had
declared
any
journey
out
of
the
question
had
prohibited
any
kind
of
motion
whatever
had
closely
laid
down
the
diet
and
drink
what
would
my
advisers
say
were
they
the
medical
attendants
and
i
the
patient
left
their
advice
and
took
the
casual
adviser
but
the
singularity
in
legion
mind
is
this
it
never
occurs
to
him
that
everybody
else
is
doing
the
same
thing
and
that
i
the
patient
perforce
say
in
sheer
like
rosalind
i
could
not
do
with
all
sidenote
chattering
hopes
the
bane
of
the
sick
chattering
hopes
may
seem
an
odd
heading
but
i
really
believe
there
is
scarcely
a
greater
worry
which
invalids
have
to
endure
than
the
incurable
hopes
of
their
friends
there
is
no
one
practice
against
which
i
can
speak
more
strongly
from
actual
personal
experience
wide
and
long
of
its
effects
during
sickness
observed
both
upon
others
and
upon
myself
i
would
appeal
most
seriously
to
all
friends
visitors
and
attendants
of
the
sick
to
leave
off
this
practice
of
attempting
to
cheer
the
sick
by
making
light
of
their
danger
and
by
exaggerating
their
probabilities
of
recovery
far
more
now
than
formerly
does
the
medical
attendant
tell
the
truth
to
the
sick
who
are
really
desirous
to
hear
it
about
their
own
state
how
intense
is
the
folly
then
to
say
the
least
of
it
of
the
friend
be
he
even
a
medical
man
who
thinks
that
his
opinion
given
after
a
cursory
observation
will
weigh
with
the
patient
against
the
opinion
of
the
medical
attendant
given
perhaps
after
years
of
observation
after
using
every
help
to
diagnosis
afforded
by
the
stethoscope
the
examination
of
pulse
tongue
and
certainly
after
much
more
observation
than
the
friend
can
possibly
have
had
supposing
the
patient
to
be
possessed
of
common
sense
how
can
the
favourable
opinion
if
it
is
to
be
called
an
opinion
at
all
of
the
casual
visitor
cheer
him
when
different
from
that
of
the
experienced
attendant
unquestionably
the
latter
may
and
often
does
turn
out
to
be
wrong
but
which
is
most
likely
to
be
wrong
sidenote
patient
does
not
want
to
talk
of
himself
the
fact
is
that
the
patient
is
not
cheered
at
all
by
these
most
tiresome
friends
on
the
contrary
he
is
depressed
and
wearied
if
on
the
one
hand
he
exerts
himself
to
tell
each
successive
member
of
this
too
numerous
conspiracy
whose
name
is
legion
why
he
does
not
think
as
they
do
in
what
respect
he
is
worse
what
symptoms
exist
that
they
know
nothing
of
he
is
fatigued
instead
of
cheered
and
his
attention
is
fixed
upon
himself
in
general
patients
who
are
really
ill
do
not
want
to
talk
about
themselves
hypochondriacs
do
but
again
i
say
we
are
not
on
the
subject
of
hypochondriacs
sidenote
absurd
consolations
put
forth
for
the
benefit
of
the
sick
if
on
the
other
hand
and
which
is
much
more
frequently
the
case
the
patient
says
nothing
but
the
shakespearian
oh
ah
go
to
and
in
good
sooth
in
order
to
escape
from
the
conversation
about
himself
the
sooner
he
is
depressed
by
want
of
sympathy
he
feels
isolated
in
the
midst
of
friends
he
feels
what
a
convenience
it
would
be
if
there
were
any
single
person
to
whom
he
could
speak
simply
and
openly
without
pulling
the
string
upon
himself
of
this
of
silly
hopes
and
encouragements
to
whom
he
could
express
his
wishes
and
directions
without
that
person
persisting
in
saying
i
hope
that
it
will
please
god
yet
to
give
you
twenty
years
or
you
have
a
long
life
of
activity
before
you
how
often
we
see
at
the
end
of
biographies
or
of
cases
recorded
in
medical
papers
after
a
long
illness
died
rather
suddenly
or
unexpectedly
both
to
himself
and
to
others
unexpectedly
to
others
perhaps
who
did
not
see
because
they
did
not
look
but
by
no
means
unexpectedly
to
himself
as
i
feel
entitled
to
believe
both
from
the
internal
evidence
in
such
stories
and
from
watching
similar
cases
there
was
every
reason
to
expect
that
would
die
and
he
knew
it
but
he
found
it
useless
to
insist
upon
his
own
knowledge
to
his
friends
in
these
remarks
i
am
alluding
neither
to
acute
cases
which
terminate
rapidly
nor
to
nervous
cases
by
the
first
much
interest
in
their
own
danger
is
very
rarely
felt
in
writings
of
fiction
whether
novels
or
biographies
these
are
generally
depicted
as
almost
seraphic
in
lucidity
of
intelligence
sadly
large
has
been
my
experience
in
and
i
can
only
say
that
i
have
seldom
or
never
seen
such
indifference
excepting
with
regard
to
bodily
suffering
or
to
some
duty
the
dying
man
desires
to
perform
is
the
far
more
usual
state
the
nervous
case
on
the
other
hand
delights
in
figuring
to
himself
and
others
a
fictitious
danger
but
the
long
chronic
case
who
knows
too
well
himself
and
who
has
been
told
by
his
physician
that
he
will
never
enter
active
life
again
who
feels
that
every
month
he
has
to
give
up
something
he
could
do
the
month
before
oh
spare
such
sufferers
your
chattering
hopes
you
do
not
know
how
you
worry
and
weary
them
such
real
sufferers
can
not
bear
to
talk
of
themselves
still
less
to
hope
for
what
they
can
not
at
all
expect
so
also
as
to
all
the
advice
showered
so
profusely
upon
such
sick
to
leave
off
some
occupation
to
try
some
other
doctor
some
other
house
climate
pill
powder
or
specific
i
say
nothing
of
the
inconsistency
for
these
advisers
are
sure
to
be
the
same
persons
who
exhorted
the
sick
man
not
to
believe
his
own
doctor
prognostics
because
doctors
are
always
mistaken
but
to
believe
some
other
doctor
because
this
doctor
is
always
right
sure
also
are
these
advisers
to
be
the
persons
to
bring
the
sick
man
fresh
occupation
while
exhorting
him
to
leave
his
own
sidenote
wonderful
presumption
of
the
advisers
of
the
sick
wonderful
is
the
face
with
which
friends
lay
and
medical
will
come
in
and
worry
the
patient
with
recommendations
to
do
something
or
other
having
just
as
little
knowledge
as
to
its
being
feasible
or
even
safe
for
him
as
if
they
were
to
recommend
a
man
to
take
exercise
not
knowing
he
had
broken
his
leg
what
would
the
friend
say
if
were
the
medical
attendant
and
if
the
patient
because
some
friend
had
come
in
because
somebody
anybody
nobody
had
recommended
something
anything
nothing
were
to
disregard
orders
and
take
that
other
body
recommendation
but
people
never
think
of
this
sidenote
advisers
the
same
now
as
two
hundred
years
ago
a
celebrated
historical
personage
has
related
the
commonplaces
which
when
on
the
eve
of
executing
a
remarkable
resolution
were
showered
in
nearly
the
same
words
by
every
one
around
successively
for
a
period
of
six
months
to
these
the
personage
states
that
it
was
found
least
trouble
always
to
reply
the
same
thing
that
it
could
not
be
supposed
that
such
a
resolution
had
been
taken
without
sufficient
previous
consideration
to
patients
enduring
every
day
for
years
from
every
friend
or
acquaintance
either
by
letter
or
some
torment
of
this
kind
i
would
suggest
the
same
answer
it
would
indeed
be
spared
if
such
friends
and
acquaintances
would
but
consider
for
one
moment
that
it
is
probable
the
patient
has
heard
such
advice
at
least
fifty
times
before
and
that
had
it
been
practicable
it
would
have
been
practised
long
ago
but
of
such
consideration
there
appears
to
be
no
chance
strange
though
true
that
people
should
be
just
the
same
in
these
things
as
they
were
a
few
hundred
years
ago
to
me
these
commonplaces
leaving
their
smear
upon
the
cheerful
constant
devotion
to
duty
which
is
so
often
seen
in
the
decline
of
such
sufferers
recall
the
slimy
trail
left
by
the
snail
on
the
sunny
southern
loaded
with
fruit
sidenote
mockery
of
the
advice
given
to
sick
no
mockery
in
the
world
is
so
hollow
as
the
advice
showered
upon
the
sick
it
is
of
no
use
for
the
sick
to
say
anything
for
what
the
adviser
wants
is
to
know
the
truth
about
the
state
of
the
patient
but
to
turn
whatever
the
sick
may
say
to
the
support
of
his
own
argument
set
forth
it
must
be
repeated
without
any
inquiry
whatever
into
the
patient
real
condition
but
it
would
be
impertinent
or
indecent
in
me
to
make
such
an
inquiry
says
the
adviser
true
and
how
much
more
impertinent
is
it
to
give
your
advice
when
you
can
know
nothing
about
the
truth
and
admit
you
could
not
inquire
into
it
to
nurses
i
say
these
are
the
visitors
who
do
your
patient
harm
when
you
hear
him
told
that
he
has
nothing
the
matter
with
him
and
that
he
wants
cheering
that
he
is
committing
suicide
and
that
he
wants
preventing
that
he
is
the
tool
of
somebody
who
makes
use
of
him
for
a
purpose
that
he
will
listen
to
nobody
but
is
obstinately
bent
upon
his
own
way
and
that
he
ought
to
be
called
to
the
sense
of
duty
and
is
flying
in
the
face
of
providence
then
know
that
your
patient
is
receiving
all
the
injury
that
he
can
receive
from
a
visitor
how
little
the
real
sufferings
of
illness
are
known
or
understood
how
little
does
any
one
in
good
health
fancy
him
or
even
into
the
life
of
a
sick
person
sidenote
means
of
giving
pleasure
to
the
sick
do
you
who
are
about
the
sick
or
who
visit
the
sick
try
and
give
them
pleasure
remember
to
tell
them
what
will
do
so
how
often
in
such
visits
the
sick
person
has
to
do
the
whole
conversation
exerting
his
own
imagination
and
memory
while
you
would
take
the
visitor
absorbed
in
his
own
anxieties
making
no
effort
of
memory
or
imagination
for
the
sick
person
oh
my
dear
i
have
so
much
to
think
of
i
really
quite
forgot
to
tell
him
that
besides
i
thought
he
would
know
it
says
the
visitor
to
another
friend
how
could
he
know
it
depend
upon
it
the
people
who
say
this
are
really
those
who
have
little
to
think
of
there
are
many
burthened
with
business
who
always
manage
to
keep
a
in
their
minds
full
of
things
to
tell
the
invalid
i
do
not
say
do
tell
him
your
anxieties
i
believe
it
is
good
for
him
and
good
for
you
too
but
if
you
tell
him
what
is
anxious
surely
you
can
remember
to
tell
him
what
is
pleasant
too
a
sick
person
does
so
enjoy
hearing
good
news
for
instance
of
a
love
and
courtship
while
in
progress
to
a
good
ending
if
you
tell
him
only
when
the
marriage
takes
place
he
loses
half
the
pleasure
which
god
knows
he
has
little
enough
of
and
ten
to
one
but
you
have
told
him
of
some
with
a
bad
ending
a
sick
person
also
intensely
enjoys
hearing
of
any
good
any
positive
or
practical
success
of
the
right
he
has
so
much
of
books
and
fiction
of
principles
and
precepts
and
theories
do
instead
of
advising
him
with
advice
he
has
heard
at
least
fifty
times
before
tell
him
of
one
benevolent
act
which
has
really
succeeded
practically
it
is
like
a
day
health
to
him
you
have
no
idea
what
the
craving
of
sick
with
undiminished
power
of
thinking
but
little
power
of
doing
is
to
hear
of
good
practical
action
when
they
can
no
longer
partake
in
it
do
observe
these
things
with
the
sick
do
remember
how
their
life
is
to
them
disappointed
and
incomplete
you
see
them
lying
there
with
miserable
disappointments
from
which
they
can
have
no
escape
but
death
and
you
ca
remember
to
tell
them
of
what
would
give
them
so
much
pleasure
or
at
least
an
hour
variety
they
do
want
you
to
be
lachrymose
and
whining
with
them
they
like
you
to
be
fresh
and
active
and
interested
but
they
can
not
bear
absence
of
mind
and
they
are
so
tired
of
the
advice
and
preaching
they
receive
from
every
body
no
matter
whom
it
is
they
see
there
is
no
better
society
than
babies
and
sick
people
for
one
another
of
course
you
must
manage
this
so
that
neither
shall
suffer
from
it
which
is
perfectly
possible
if
you
think
the
air
of
the
sick
room
bad
for
the
baby
why
it
is
bad
for
the
invalid
too
and
therefore
you
will
of
course
correct
it
for
both
it
freshens
up
a
sick
person
whole
mental
atmosphere
to
see
the
baby
and
a
very
young
child
if
unspoiled
will
generally
adapt
itself
wonderfully
to
the
ways
of
a
sick
person
if
the
time
they
spend
together
is
not
too
long
if
you
knew
how
unreasonably
sick
people
suffer
from
reasonable
causes
of
distress
you
would
take
more
pains
about
all
these
things
an
infant
laid
upon
the
sick
bed
will
do
the
sick
person
thus
suffering
more
good
than
all
your
logic
a
piece
of
good
news
will
do
the
same
perhaps
you
are
afraid
of
disturbing
him
you
say
there
is
no
comfort
for
his
present
cause
of
affliction
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
the
distinction
is
this
if
he
is
obliged
to
act
do
not
disturb
him
with
another
subject
of
thought
just
yet
help
him
to
do
what
he
wants
to
do
but
if
he
done
this
or
if
nothing
be
done
then
disturb
him
by
all
means
you
will
relieve
more
effectually
unreasonable
suffering
from
reasonable
causes
by
telling
him
the
news
showing
him
the
baby
or
giving
him
something
new
to
think
of
or
to
look
at
than
by
all
the
logic
in
the
world
it
has
been
very
justly
said
that
the
sick
are
like
children
in
this
that
there
is
no
in
events
to
them
now
it
is
your
business
as
their
visitor
to
restore
this
right
proportion
for
them
to
shew
them
what
the
rest
of
the
world
is
doing
how
can
they
find
it
out
otherwise
you
will
find
them
far
more
open
to
conviction
than
children
in
this
and
you
will
find
that
their
unreasonable
intensity
of
suffering
from
unkindness
from
want
of
sympathy
will
disappear
with
their
freshened
interest
in
the
big
world
events
but
then
you
must
be
able
to
give
them
real
interests
not
gossip
sidenote
two
new
classes
of
patients
peculiar
to
this
generation
there
are
two
classes
of
patients
which
are
unfortunately
becoming
more
common
every
day
especially
among
women
of
the
richer
orders
to
whom
all
these
remarks
are
inapplicable
those
who
make
health
an
excuse
for
doing
nothing
and
at
the
same
time
allege
that
the
being
able
to
do
nothing
is
their
only
grief
those
who
have
brought
upon
themselves
by
over
pursuit
of
amusement
which
they
and
their
friends
have
most
unhappily
called
intellectual
activity
i
scarcely
know
a
greater
injury
that
can
be
inflicted
than
the
advice
too
often
given
to
the
first
class
to
vegetate
or
than
the
admiration
too
often
bestowed
on
the
latter
class
for
pluck
xiii
observation
of
the
sick
sidenote
what
is
the
use
of
the
question
is
he
better
there
is
no
more
silly
or
universal
question
scarcely
asked
than
this
is
he
better
ask
it
of
the
medical
attendant
if
you
please
but
of
whom
else
if
you
wish
for
a
real
answer
to
your
question
would
you
ask
it
certainly
not
of
the
casual
visitor
certainly
not
of
the
nurse
while
the
nurse
observation
is
so
little
exercised
as
it
is
now
what
you
want
are
facts
not
opinions
for
who
can
have
any
opinion
of
any
value
as
to
whether
the
patient
is
better
or
worse
excepting
the
constant
medical
attendant
or
the
really
observing
nurse
the
most
important
practical
lesson
that
can
be
given
to
nurses
is
to
teach
them
what
to
observe
how
to
observe
what
symptoms
indicate
improvement
what
the
reverse
which
are
of
importance
which
are
of
none
which
are
the
evidence
of
neglect
and
of
what
kind
of
neglect
all
this
is
what
ought
to
make
part
and
an
essential
part
of
the
training
of
every
nurse
at
present
how
few
there
are
either
professional
or
unprofessional
who
really
know
at
all
whether
any
sick
person
they
may
be
with
is
better
or
worse
the
vagueness
and
looseness
of
the
information
one
receives
in
answer
to
that
much
abused
question
is
he
better
would
be
ludicrous
if
it
were
not
painful
the
only
sensible
answer
in
the
present
state
of
knowledge
about
sickness
would
be
how
can
i
know
i
can
not
tell
how
he
was
when
i
was
not
with
him
i
can
record
but
a
very
few
specimens
of
the
answers
which
i
have
heard
made
by
friends
and
nurses
and
accepted
by
physicians
and
surgeons
at
the
very
of
the
patient
who
could
have
contradicted
every
word
but
did
not
sometimes
from
amiability
often
from
shyness
oftenest
from
languor
how
often
have
the
bowels
acted
nurse
once
sir
this
generally
means
that
the
utensil
has
been
emptied
once
it
having
been
used
perhaps
seven
or
eight
times
do
you
think
the
patient
is
much
weaker
than
he
was
six
weeks
ago
oh
no
sir
you
know
it
is
very
long
since
he
has
been
up
and
dressed
and
he
can
get
across
the
room
now
this
means
that
the
nurse
has
not
observed
that
whereas
six
weeks
ago
he
sat
up
and
occupied
himself
in
bed
he
now
lies
still
doing
nothing
that
although
he
can
get
across
the
room
he
can
not
stand
for
five
seconds
another
patient
who
is
eating
well
recovering
steadily
although
slowly
from
fever
but
can
not
walk
or
stand
is
represented
to
the
doctor
as
making
no
progress
at
all
sidenote
leading
questions
useless
or
misleading
questions
too
as
asked
now
but
too
generally
of
or
about
patients
would
obtain
no
information
at
all
about
them
even
if
the
person
asked
of
had
every
information
to
give
the
question
is
generally
a
leading
question
and
it
is
singular
that
people
never
think
what
must
be
the
answer
to
this
question
before
they
ask
it
for
instance
has
he
had
a
good
night
now
one
patient
will
think
he
has
a
bad
night
if
he
has
not
slept
ten
hours
without
waking
another
does
not
think
he
has
a
bad
night
if
he
has
had
intervals
of
dosing
occasionally
the
same
answer
has
actually
been
given
as
regarded
two
patients
one
who
had
been
entirely
sleepless
for
five
times
hours
and
died
of
it
and
another
who
had
not
slept
the
sleep
of
a
regular
night
without
waking
why
can
not
the
question
be
asked
how
many
hours
sleep
has
had
and
at
what
hours
of
the
night
i
have
never
closed
my
eyes
all
night
an
answer
as
frequently
made
when
the
speaker
has
had
several
hours
sleep
as
when
he
has
had
none
would
then
be
less
often
said
lies
intentional
and
unintentional
are
much
seldomer
told
in
answer
to
precise
than
to
leading
questions
another
frequent
error
is
to
inquire
whether
one
cause
remains
and
not
whether
the
effect
which
may
be
produced
by
a
great
many
different
causes
inquired
after
remains
as
when
it
is
asked
whether
there
was
noise
in
the
street
last
night
and
if
there
were
not
the
patient
is
reported
without
more
ado
to
have
had
a
good
night
patients
are
completely
taken
aback
by
these
kinds
of
leading
questions
and
give
only
the
exact
amount
of
information
asked
for
even
when
they
know
it
to
be
completely
misleading
the
shyness
of
patients
is
seldom
allowed
for
how
few
there
are
who
by
five
or
six
pointed
questions
can
elicit
the
whole
case
and
get
accurately
to
know
and
to
be
able
to
report
the
patient
is
sidenote
means
of
obtaining
inaccurate
information
i
knew
a
very
clever
physician
of
large
dispensary
and
hospital
practice
who
invariably
began
his
examination
of
each
patient
with
put
your
finger
where
you
be
bad
that
man
would
never
waste
his
time
with
collecting
inaccurate
information
from
nurse
or
patient
leading
questions
always
collect
inaccurate
information
at
a
recent
celebrated
trial
the
following
leading
question
was
put
successively
to
nine
distinguished
medical
men
can
you
attribute
these
symptoms
to
anything
else
but
poison
and
out
of
the
nine
eight
answered
no
without
any
qualification
whatever
it
appeared
upon
that
none
of
them
had
ever
seen
a
case
of
the
kind
of
poisoning
supposed
that
none
of
them
had
ever
seen
a
case
of
the
kind
of
disease
to
which
the
death
if
not
to
poison
was
attributable
that
none
of
them
were
even
aware
of
the
main
fact
of
the
disease
and
condition
to
which
the
death
was
attributable
surely
nothing
stronger
can
be
adduced
to
prove
what
use
leading
questions
are
of
and
what
they
lead
to
i
had
rather
not
say
how
many
instances
i
have
known
where
owing
to
this
system
of
leading
questions
the
patient
has
died
and
the
attendants
have
been
actually
unaware
of
the
principal
feature
of
the
case
sidenote
as
to
food
patient
takes
or
does
not
take
it
is
useless
to
go
through
all
the
particulars
besides
sleep
in
which
people
have
a
peculiar
talent
for
gleaning
inaccurate
information
as
to
food
for
instance
i
often
think
that
most
common
question
how
is
your
appetite
can
only
be
put
because
the
questioner
believes
the
questioned
has
really
nothing
the
matter
with
him
which
is
very
often
the
case
but
where
there
is
the
remark
holds
good
which
has
been
made
about
sleep
the
answer
will
often
be
made
as
regards
a
patient
who
can
not
take
two
ounces
of
solid
food
per
diem
and
a
patient
who
does
not
enjoy
five
meals
a
day
as
much
as
usual
again
the
question
how
is
your
appetite
is
often
put
when
how
is
your
digestion
is
the
question
meant
no
doubt
the
two
things
depend
on
one
another
but
they
are
quite
different
many
a
patient
can
eat
if
you
can
only
tempt
his
appetite
the
fault
lies
in
your
not
having
got
him
the
thing
that
he
fancies
but
many
another
patient
does
not
care
between
grapes
and
turnips
everything
is
equally
distasteful
to
him
he
would
try
to
eat
anything
which
would
do
him
good
but
everything
makes
him
worse
the
fault
here
generally
lies
in
the
cooking
it
is
not
his
appetite
which
requires
tempting
it
is
his
digestion
which
requires
sparing
and
good
sick
cookery
will
save
the
digestion
half
its
work
there
may
be
four
different
causes
any
one
of
which
will
produce
the
same
result
the
patient
slowly
starving
to
death
from
want
of
nutrition
defect
in
cooking
defect
in
choice
of
diet
defect
in
choice
of
hours
for
taking
diet
defect
of
appetite
in
patient
yet
all
these
are
generally
comprehended
in
the
one
sweeping
assertion
that
the
patient
has
no
appetite
surely
many
lives
might
be
saved
by
drawing
a
closer
distinction
for
the
remedies
are
as
diverse
as
the
causes
the
remedy
for
the
first
is
to
cook
better
for
the
second
to
choose
other
articles
of
diet
for
the
third
to
watch
for
the
hours
when
the
patient
is
in
want
of
food
for
the
fourth
to
show
him
what
he
likes
and
sometimes
unexpectedly
but
no
one
of
these
remedies
will
do
for
any
other
of
the
defects
not
corresponding
with
it
i
can
not
too
often
repeat
that
patients
are
generally
either
too
languid
to
observe
these
things
or
too
shy
to
speak
about
them
nor
is
it
well
that
they
should
be
made
to
observe
them
it
fixes
their
attention
upon
themselves
again
i
say
what
the
nurse
or
friend
there
for
except
to
take
note
of
these
things
instead
of
the
patient
doing
so
sidenote
as
to
diarrhoea
again
the
question
is
sometimes
put
is
there
diarrhoea
and
the
answer
will
be
the
same
whether
it
is
just
merging
into
cholera
whether
it
is
a
trifling
degree
brought
on
by
some
trifling
indiscretion
which
will
cease
the
moment
the
cause
is
removed
or
whether
there
is
no
diarrhoea
at
all
but
simply
relaxed
bowels
it
is
useless
to
multiply
instances
of
this
kind
as
long
as
observation
is
so
little
cultivated
as
it
is
now
i
do
believe
that
it
is
better
for
the
physician
to
see
the
friends
of
the
patient
at
all
they
will
oftener
mislead
him
than
not
and
as
often
by
making
the
patient
out
worse
as
better
than
he
really
is
in
the
case
of
infants
must
depend
upon
the
accurate
observation
of
the
nurse
or
mother
who
has
to
report
and
how
seldom
is
this
condition
of
accuracy
fulfilled
sidenote
means
of
cultivating
sound
and
ready
observation
a
celebrated
man
though
celebrated
only
for
foolish
things
has
told
us
that
one
of
his
main
objects
in
the
education
of
his
son
was
to
give
him
a
ready
habit
of
accurate
observation
a
certainty
of
perception
and
that
for
this
purpose
one
of
his
means
was
a
month
course
as
follows
he
took
the
boy
rapidly
past
a
the
father
and
son
then
described
to
each
other
as
many
of
the
objects
as
they
could
which
they
had
seen
in
passing
the
windows
noting
them
down
with
pencil
and
paper
and
returning
afterwards
to
verify
their
own
accuracy
the
boy
always
succeeded
best
if
the
father
described
objects
the
boy
did
and
scarcely
ever
made
a
mistake
i
have
often
thought
how
wise
a
piece
of
education
this
would
be
for
much
higher
objects
and
in
our
calling
of
nurses
the
thing
itself
is
essential
for
it
may
safely
be
said
not
that
the
habit
of
ready
and
correct
observation
will
by
itself
make
us
useful
nurses
but
that
without
it
we
shall
be
useless
with
all
our
devotion
i
have
known
a
nurse
in
charge
of
a
set
of
wards
who
not
only
carried
in
her
head
all
the
little
varieties
in
the
diets
which
each
patient
was
allowed
to
fix
for
himself
but
also
exactly
what
each
patient
had
taken
during
each
day
i
have
known
another
nurse
in
charge
of
one
single
patient
who
took
away
his
meals
day
after
day
all
but
untouched
and
never
knew
it
if
you
find
it
helps
you
to
note
down
such
things
on
a
bit
of
paper
in
pencil
by
all
means
do
so
i
think
it
more
often
lames
than
strengthens
the
memory
and
observation
but
if
you
can
not
get
the
habit
of
observation
one
way
or
other
you
had
better
give
up
the
being
a
nurse
for
it
is
not
your
calling
however
kind
and
anxious
you
may
be
surely
you
can
learn
at
least
to
judge
with
the
eye
how
much
an
oz
of
solid
food
is
how
much
an
oz
of
liquid
you
will
find
this
helps
your
observation
and
memory
very
much
you
will
then
say
to
yourself
took
about
an
oz
of
his
meat
to
day
took
three
times
in
hours
about
pint
of
beef
tea
instead
of
saying
has
taken
nothing
all
day
or
i
gave
his
dinner
as
usual
sidenote
sound
and
ready
observation
essential
in
a
nurse
i
have
known
several
of
our
real
hospital
sisters
who
could
as
accurately
as
a
measuring
glass
measure
out
all
their
patients
wine
and
medicine
by
the
eye
and
never
be
wrong
i
do
not
recommend
this
one
must
be
very
sure
of
one
self
to
do
it
i
only
mention
it
because
if
a
nurse
can
by
practice
measure
medicine
by
the
eye
surely
she
is
no
nurse
who
can
not
measure
by
the
eye
about
how
much
food
in
oz
her
patient
has
taken
in
hospitals
those
who
cut
up
the
diets
give
with
quite
sufficient
accuracy
to
each
patient
his
oz
or
his
oz
of
meat
without
weighing
yet
a
nurse
will
often
have
patients
loathing
all
food
and
incapable
of
any
will
to
get
well
who
just
tumble
over
the
contents
of
the
plate
or
dip
the
spoon
in
the
cup
to
deceive
the
nurse
and
she
will
take
it
away
without
ever
seeing
that
there
is
just
the
same
quantity
of
food
as
when
she
brought
it
and
she
will
tell
the
doctor
too
that
the
patient
has
eaten
all
his
diets
as
usual
when
all
she
ought
to
have
meant
is
that
she
has
taken
away
his
diets
as
usual
now
what
kind
of
a
nurse
is
this
sidenote
difference
of
excitable
and
temperaments
i
would
call
attention
to
something
else
in
which
nurses
frequently
fail
in
observation
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
excitable
and
what
i
will
call
the
temperament
in
patients
one
will
blaze
up
at
once
under
any
shock
or
anxiety
and
sleep
very
comfortably
after
it
another
will
seem
quite
calm
and
even
torpid
under
the
same
shock
and
people
say
he
hardly
felt
it
at
all
yet
you
will
find
him
some
time
after
slowly
sinking
the
same
remark
applies
to
the
action
of
narcotics
of
aperients
which
in
the
one
take
effect
directly
in
the
other
not
perhaps
for
hours
a
journey
a
visit
an
unwonted
exertion
will
affect
the
one
immediately
but
he
recovers
after
it
the
other
bears
it
very
well
at
the
time
apparently
and
dies
or
is
prostrated
for
life
by
it
people
often
say
how
difficult
the
excitable
temperament
is
to
manage
i
say
how
difficult
is
the
temperament
with
the
first
you
have
an
which
you
could
anticipate
and
it
is
all
over
with
the
second
you
never
know
where
you
are
you
never
know
when
the
consequences
are
over
and
it
requires
your
closest
observation
to
know
what
the
consequences
of
what
for
the
consequent
by
no
means
follows
immediately
upon
the
antecedent
and
coarse
observation
is
utterly
at
fault
sidenote
superstition
the
fruit
of
bad
observation
almost
all
superstitions
are
owing
to
bad
observation
to
the
hoc
ergo
propter
and
bad
observers
are
almost
all
superstitious
farmers
used
to
attribute
disease
among
cattle
to
witchcraft
weddings
have
been
attributed
to
seeing

magpie
deaths
to
seeing
three
and
i
have
heard
the
most
highly
educated
draw
consequences
for
the
sick

resembling
these
sidenote
physiognomy
of
disease
little
shown
by
the
face
another
remark
although
there
is
unquestionably
a
physiognomy
of
disease
as
well
as
of
health
of
all
parts
of
the
body
the
face
is
perhaps
the
one
which
tells
the
least
to
the
common
observer
or
the
casual
visitor
because
of
all
parts
of
the
body
it
is
the
one
most
exposed
to
other
influences
besides
health
and
people
never
or
scarcely
ever
observe
enough
to
know
how
to
distinguish
between
the
effect
of
exposure
of
robust
health
of
a
tender
skin
of
a
tendency
to
congestion
of
suffusion
flushing
or
many
other
things
again
the
face
is
often
the
last
to
shew
emaciation
i
should
say
that
the
hand
was
a
much
surer
test
than
the
face
both
as
to
flesh
colour
circulation
it
is
true
that
there
are
diseases
which
are
only
betrayed
at
all
by
something
in
the
face
the
eye
or
the
tongue
as
great
irritability
of
brain
by
the
appearance
of
the
pupil
of
the
eye
but
we
are
talking
of
casual
not
minute
observation
and
few
minute
observers
will
hesitate
to
say
that
far
more
untruth
than
truth
is
conveyed
by
the
oft
repeated
words
he
well
or
ill
or
better
or
worse
wonderful
is
the
way
in
which
people
will
go
upon
the
slightest
observation
or
often
upon
no
observation
at
all
or
upon
some
which
the
world
experience
if
it
had
any
would
have
pronounced
utterly
false
long
ago
i
have
known
patients
dying
of
sheer
pain
exhaustion
and
want
of
sleep
from
one
of
the
most
lingering
and
painful
diseases
known
preserve
till
within
a
few
days
of
death
not
only
the
healthy
colour
of
the
cheek
but
the
mottled
appearance
of
a
robust
child
and
scores
of
times
have
i
heard
these
unfortunate
creatures
assailed
with
i
am
glad
to
see
you
looking
so
well
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
not
live
till
ninety
years
of
age
why
do
you
take
a
little
more
exercise
and
amusement
with
all
the
other
commonplaces
with
which
we
are
so
familiar
there
is
unquestionably
a
physiognomy
of
disease
let
the
nurse
learn
it
the
experienced
nurse
can
always
tell
that
a
person
has
taken
a
narcotic
the
night
before
by
the
patchiness
of
the
colour
about
the
face
when
the
of
depression
has
set
in
that
very
colour
which
the
inexperienced
will
point
to
as
a
proof
of
health
there
is
again
a
faintness
which
does
not
betray
itself
by
the
colour
at
all
or
in
which
the
patient
becomes
brown
instead
of
white
there
is
a
faintness
of
another
kind
which
it
is
true
can
always
be
seen
by
the
paleness
but
the
nurse
seldom
distinguishes
she
will
talk
to
the
patient
who
is
too
faint
to
move
without
the
least
scruple
unless
he
is
pale
and
unless
luckily
for
him
the
muscles
of
the
throat
are
affected
and
he
loses
his
voice
yet
these
two
faintnesses
are
perfectly
distinguishable
by
the
mere
countenance
of
the
patient
sidenote
peculiarities
of
patients
again
the
nurse
must
distinguish
between
the
idiosyncracies
of
patients
one
likes
to
suffer
out
all
his
suffering
alone
to
be
as
little
looked
after
as
possible
another
likes
to
be
perpetually
made
much
of
and
pitied
and
to
have
some
one
always
by
him
both
these
peculiarities
might
be
observed
and
indulged
much
more
than
they
are
for
quite
as
often
does
it
happen
that
a
busy
attendance
is
forced
upon
the
first
patient
who
wishes
for
nothing
but
to
be
let
alone
as
that
the
second
is
left
to
think
himself
neglected
sidenote
nurse
must
observe
for
herself
increase
of
weakness
patient
will
not
tell
her
again
i
think
that
few
things
press
so
heavily
on
one
suffering
from
long
and
incurable
illness
as
the
necessity
of
recording
in
words
from
time
to
time
for
the
information
of
the
nurse
who
will
not
otherwise
see
that
he
can
not
do
this
or
that
which
he
could
do
a
month
or
a
year
ago
what
is
a
nurse
there
for
if
she
can
not
observe
these
things
for
herself
yet
i
have
known
and
known
too
among
those
and
among
those
whom
money
and
position
put
in
possession
of
everything
which
money
and
position
could
give
i
have
known
i
say
more
accidents
fatal
slowly
or
rapidly
arising
from
this
want
of
observation
among
nurses
than
from
almost
anything
else
because
a
patient
could
get
out
of
a
alone
a
month
ago
because
a
patient
could
walk
as
far
as
his
bell
a
week
ago
the
nurse
concludes
that
he
can
do
so
now
she
has
never
observed
the
change
and
the
patient
is
lost
from
being
left
in
a
helpless
state
of
exhaustion
till
some
one
accidentally
comes
in
and
this
not
from
any
unexpected
apoplectic
paralytic
or
fainting
fit
though
even
these
could
be
expected
far
more
at
least
than
they
are
now
if
we
did
but
no
from
the
expected
or
to
be
expected
inevitable
visible
calculable
uninterrupted
increase
of
weakness
which
none
need
fail
to
observe
sidenote
accidents
arising
from
the
nurse
want
of
observation
again
a
patient
not
usually
confined
to
bed
is
compelled
by
an
attack
of
diarrhoea
vomiting
or
other
accident
to
keep
his
bed
for
a
few
days
he
gets
up
for
the
first
time
and
the
nurse
lets
him
go
into
another
room
without
coming
in
a
few
minutes
afterwards
to
look
after
him
it
never
occurs
to
her
that
he
is
quite
certain
to
be
faint
or
cold
or
to
want
something
she
says
as
her
excuse
oh
he
does
not
like
to
be
fidgetted
after
yes
he
said
so
some
weeks
ago
but
he
never
said
he
did
not
like
to
be
fidgetted
after
when
he
is
in
the
state
he
is
in
now
and
if
he
did
you
ought
to
make
some
excuse
to
go
in
to
him
more
patients
have
been
lost
in
this
way
than
is
at
all
generally
known
from
relapses
brought
on
by
being
left
for
an
hour
or
two
faint
or
cold
or
hungry
after
getting
up
for
the
first
time
sidenote
is
the
faculty
of
observing
on
the
decline
yet
it
appears
that
scarcely
any
improvement
in
the
faculty
of
observing
is
being
made
vast
has
been
the
increase
of
knowledge
in
pathology
that
science
which
teaches
us
the
final
change
produced
by
disease
on
the
human
frame
scarce
any
in
the
art
of
observing
the
signs
of
the
change
while
in
progress
or
rather
is
it
not
to
be
feared
that
observation
as
an
essential
part
of
medicine
has
been
declining
which
of
us
has
not
heard
fifty
times
from
one
or
another
a
nurse
or
a
friend
of
the
sick
aye
and
a
medical
friend
too
the
following
remark
so
a
is
worse
or
b
is
dead
i
saw
him
the
day
before
i
thought
him
so
much
better
there
certainly
was
no
appearance
from
which
one
could
have
expected
so
sudden
a
change
i
have
never
heard
any
one
say
though
one
would
think
it
the
more
natural
thing
there
have
been
appearance
which
i
should
have
seen
if
i
had
but
looked
let
me
try
and
remember
what
there
was
that
i
may
observe
another
time
no
this
is
not
what
people
say
they
boldly
assert
that
there
was
nothing
to
observe
not
that
their
observation
was
at
fault
let
people
who
have
to
observe
sickness
and
death
look
back
and
try
to
register
in
their
observation
the
appearances
which
have
preceded
relapse
attack
or
death
and
not
assert
that
there
were
none
or
that
there
were
not
the
ones
sidenote
observation
of
general
conditions
a
want
of
the
habit
of
observing
conditions
and
an
inveterate
habit
of
taking
averages
are
each
of
them
often
equally
misleading
men
whose
profession
like
that
of
medical
men
leads
them
to
observe
only
or
chiefly
palpable
and
permanent
organic
changes
are
often
just
as
wrong
in
their
opinion
of
the
result
as
those
who
do
not
observe
at
all
for
instance
there
is
a
broken
leg
the
surgeon
has
only
to
look
at
it
once
to
know
it
will
not
be
different
if
he
sees
it
in
the
morning
to
what
it
would
have
been
had
he
seen
it
in
the
evening
and
in
whatever
conditions
the
patient
is
or
is
likely
to
be
there
will
still
be
the
broken
leg
until
it
is
set
the
same
with
many
organic
diseases
an
experienced
physician
has
but
to
feel
the
pulse
once
and
he
knows
that
there
is
aneurism
which
will
kill
some
time
or
other
but
with
the
great
majority
of
cases
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
and
the
power
of
forming
any
correct
opinion
as
to
the
result
must
entirely
depend
upon
an
enquiry
into
all
the
conditions
in
which
the
patient
lives
in
a
complicated
state
of
society
in
large
towns
death
as
every
one
of
great
experience
knows
is
far
less
often
produced
by
any
one
organic
disease
than
by
some
illness
after
many
other
diseases
producing
just
the
sum
of
exhaustion
necessary
for
death
there
is
nothing
so
absurd
nothing
so
misleading
as
the
verdict
one
so
often
hears
has
no
organic
disease
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
not
live
to
extreme
old
age
sometimes
the
clause
is
added
sometimes
not
provided
he
has
quiet
good
food
good
air
the
verdict
is
repeated
by
ignorant
people
the
latter
clause
or
there
is
no
possibility
of
the
conditions
of
the
latter
clause
being
obtained
and
this
the
essential
part
of
the
whole
is
made
of
no
effect
i
have
heard
a
physician
deservedly
eminent
assure
the
friends
of
a
patient
of
his
recovery
why
because
he
had
now
prescribed
a
course
every
detail
of
which
the
patient
had
followed
for
years
and
because
he
had
forbidden
a
course
which
the
patient
could
not
by
any
possibility
alter
undoubtedly
a
person
of
no
scientific
knowledge
whatever
but
of
observation
and
experience
in
these
kinds
of
conditions
will
be
able
to
arrive
at
a
much
truer
guess
as
to
the
probable
duration
of
life
of
members
of
a
family
or
inmates
of
a
house
than
the
most
scientific
physician
to
whom
the
same
persons
are
brought
to
have
their
pulse
felt
no
enquiry
being
made
into
their
conditions
in
life
insurance
and
such
like
societies
were
they
instead
of
having
the
persons
examined
by
a
medical
man
to
have
the
houses
conditions
ways
of
life
of
these
persons
examined
at
how
much
truer
results
would
they
arrive

but
it
might
be
known
that
the
next
cholera
epidemic
he
runs
a
bad
chance
and
are
a
strong
healthy

but
it
might
be
known
that
they
live
in
such
a
house
in
such
a
part
of
london
so
near
the
river
that
they
will
kill
of
their
children
which
of
the
children
will
be
the
ones

survive

known
sidenote

that

not
tell

that

but
minute
enquiries
into
conditions
enable
us
to
know
that

such
a
district
nay
in
such
a
street
or
even
on
one
side
of
that
street
in
such
a
particular

or

on

of

be
the
excess
of

that

who
ought
not
to
have

it
not
very
materially
alter
the
opinion
of
whoever
were
endeavouring
to
form
one
if
he
knew
that
from
that
floor
of
that
house
of
that
street
the
man
came
much
more
precise
might
be
our
observations
even
than
this
and
much
more
correct
our
conclusions
it
is
well
known
that
the
same
names
may
be
seen
constantly
recurring
on
workhouse
books
for
generations
that
is
the
persons
were
born
and
brought
up
and
will
be
born
and
brought
up
generation
after
generation
in
the
conditions
which
make
paupers
death
and
disease
are
like
the
workhouse
they
take
from
the
same
family
the
same
house
or
in
other
words
the
same
conditions
why
will
we
not
observe
what
they
are
the
close
observer
may
safely
predict
that
such
a
family
whether
its
members
marry
or
not
will
become
extinct
that
such
another
will
degenerate
morally
and
physically
but
who
learns
the
lesson
on
the
contrary
it
may
be
well
known
that
the
children
die
in
such
a
house
at
the
rate
of
out
of
one
would
think
that
nothing
more
need
be
said
for
how
could
providence
speak
more
distinctly
yet
nobody
listens
the
family
goes
on
living
there
till
it
dies
out
and
then
some
other
family
takes
it
neither
would
they
listen
if
one
rose
from
the
dead
sidenote
what
observation
is
for
in
dwelling
upon
the
vital
importance
of
observation
it
must
never
be
lost
sight
of
what
observation
is
for
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
piling
up
miscellaneous
information
or
curious
facts
but
for
the
sake
of
saving
life
and
increasing
health
and
comfort
the
caution
may
seem
useless
but
it
is
quite
surprising
how
many
men
some
women
do
it
too
practically
behave
as
if
the
scientific
end
were
the
only
one
in
view
or
as
if
the
sick
body
were
but
a
reservoir
for
stowing
medicines
into
and
the
surgical
disease
only
a
curious
case
the
sufferer
has
made
for
the
attendant
special
information
this
is
really
no
exaggeration
you
think
if
you
suspected
your
patient
was
being
poisoned
say
by
a
copper
kettle
you
would
instantly
as
you
ought
cut
off
all
possible
connection
between
him
and
the
suspected
source
of
injury
without
regard
to
the
fact
that
a
curious
mine
of
observation
is
thereby
lost
but
it
is
not
everybody
who
does
so
and
it
has
actually
been
made
a
question
of
medical
ethics
what
should
the
medical
man
do
if
he
suspected
poisoning
the
answer
seems
a
very
simple
one
insist
on
a
confidential
nurse
being
placed
with
the
patient
or
give
up
the
case
sidenote
what
a
confidential
nurse
should
be
and
remember
every
nurse
should
be
one
who
is
to
be
depended
upon
in
other
words
capable
of
being
a
confidential
nurse
she
does
not
know
how
soon
she
may
find
herself
placed
in
such
a
situation
she
must
be
no
gossip
no
vain
talker
she
should
never
answer
questions
about
her
sick
except
to
those
who
have
a
right
to
ask
them
she
must
i
need
not
say
be
strictly
sober
and
honest
but
more
than
this
she
must
be
a
religious
and
devoted
woman
she
must
have
a
respect
for
her
own
calling
because
god
precious
gift
of
life
is
often
literally
placed
in
her
hands
she
must
be
a
sound
and
close
and
quick
observer
and
she
must
be
a
woman
of
delicate
and
decent
feeling
sidenote
observation
is
for
practical
purposes
to
return
to
the
question
of
what
observation
is
for
it
would
really
seem
as
if
some
had
considered
it
as
its
own
end
as
if
detection
not
cure
was
their
business
nay
more
in
a
recent
celebrated
trial
three
medical
men
according
to
their
own
account
suspected
poison
prescribed
for
dysentery
and
left
the
patient
to
the
poisoner
this
is
an
extreme
case
but
in
a
small
way
the
same
manner
of
acting
falls
under
the
cognizance
of
us
all
how
often
the
attendants
of
a
case
have
stated
that
they
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
patient
could
not
get
well
in
such
an
air
in
such
a
room
or
under
such
circumstances
yet
have
gone
on
dosing
him
with
medicine
and
making
no
effort
to
remove
the
poison
from
him
or
him
from

quarter

the
only

conclusion
sidenote
sanitary
nursing
as
essential
in
surgical
as
in
medical
cases
but
not
to
supersede
surgical
nursing
the
whole
of
the
preceding
remarks
apply
even
more
to
children
and
to
puerperal
women
than
to
patients
in
general
they
also
apply
to
the
nursing
of
surgical
quite
as
much
as
to
that
of
medical
cases
indeed
if
it
be
possible
cases
of
external
injury
require
such
care
even
more
than
sick
in
surgical
wards
one
duty
of
every
nurse
certainly
is
fever
or
hospital
gangrene
or
pyæmia
or
purulent
discharge
of
some
kind
may
else
supervene
has
she
a
case
of
compound
fracture
of
amputation
or
of
erysipelas
it
may
depend
very
much
on
how
she
looks
upon
the
things
enumerated
in
these
notes
whether
one
or
other
of
these
hospital
diseases
attacks
her
patient
or
not
if
she
allows
her
ward
to
become
filled
with
the
peculiar
close
foetid
smell
so
apt
to
be
produced
among
surgical
cases
especially
where
there
is
great
suppuration
and
discharge
she
may
see
a
vigorous
patient
in
the
prime
of
life
gradually
sink
and
die
where
according
to
all
human
probability
he
ought
to
have
recovered
the
surgical
nurse
must
be
ever
on
the
watch
ever
on
her
guard
against
want
of
cleanliness
foul
air
want
of
light
and
of
warmth
nevertheless
let
no
one
think
that
because
nursing
is
the
subject
of
these
notes
therefore
what
may
be
called
the
handicraft
of
nursing
is
to
be
undervalued
a
patient
may
be
left
to
bleed
to
death
in
a
sanitary
palace
another
who
can
not
move
himself
may
die
of
because
the
nurse
does
not
know
how
to
change
and
clean
him
while
he
has
every
requisite
of
air
light
and
quiet
but
nursing
as
a
handicraft
has
not
been
treated
of
here
for
three
reasons
that
these
notes
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
manual
for
nursing
any
more
than
for
cooking
for
the
sick
that
the
writer
who
has
herself
seen
more
of
what
may
be
called
surgical
nursing
practical
manual
nursing
than
perhaps
any
one
in
europe
honestly
believes
that
it
is
impossible
to
learn
it
from
any
book
and
that
it
can
only
be
thoroughly
learnt
in
the
wards
of
a
hospital
and
she
also
honestly
believes
that
the
perfection
of
surgical
nursing
may
be
seen
practised
by
the
sister
of
a
london
hospital
as
it
can
be
seen
nowhere
else
in
europe
while
thousands
die
of
foul
air
who
have
this
surgical
nursing
to
perfection
the
converse
is
comparatively
rare
sidenote
children
their
greater
susceptibility
to
the
same
things
to
revert
to
children
they
are
much
more
susceptible
than
grown
people
to
all
noxious
influences
they
are
affected
by
the
same
things
but
much
more
quickly
and
seriously
by
want
of
fresh
air
of
proper
warmth
want
of
cleanliness
in
house
clothes
bedding
or
body
by
startling
noises
improper
food
or
want
of
punctuality
by
dulness
and
by
want
of
light
by
too
much
or
too
little
covering
in
bed
or
when
up
by
want
of
the
spirit
of
management
generally
in
those
in
charge
of
them
one
can
therefore
only
press
the
importance
as
being
yet
greater
in
the
case
of
children
greatest
in
the
case
of
sick
children
of
attending
to
these
things
that
which
however
above
all
is
known
to
injure
children
seriously
is
foul
air
and
most
seriously
at
night
keeping
the
rooms
where
they
sleep
tight
shut
up
is
destruction
to
them
and
if
the
breathing
be
disordered
by
disease
a
few
hours
only
of
such
foul
air
may
endanger
its
life
even
where
no
inconvenience
is
felt
by
persons
in
the
same
room
the
following
passages
taken
out
of
an
excellent
lecture
on
sudden
death
in
infancy
and
childhood
just
published
show
the
vital
importance
of
careful
nursing
of
children
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
when
death
suddenly
befalls
the
infant
or
young
child
it
is
an
it
is
not
a
necessary
inevitable
result
of
any
disease
from
which
it
is
suffering
it
may
be
here
added
that
it
would
be
very
desirable
to
know
how
often
death
is
with
adults
not
a
necessary
inevitable
result
of
any
disease
omit
the
word
sudden
for
death
is
comparatively
rare
in
middle
age
and
the
sentence
is
almost
equally
true
for
all
ages
the
following
causes
of
accidental
death
in
sick
children
are
enumerated
sudden
noises
which
startle
a
rapid
change
of
temperature
which
chills
the
surface
though
only
for
a
moment
a
rude
awakening
from
sleep
or
even
an
or
an
meal
any
sudden
impression
on
the
nervous
system
any
hasty
alteration
of
posture
in
short
any
cause
whatever
by
which
the
respiratory
process
may
be
disturbed
it
may
again
be
added
that
with
very
weak
adult
patients
these
causes
are
also
not
often
suddenly
fatal
it
is
true
but
very
much
oftener
than
is
at
all
generally
known
irreparable
in
their
consequences
both
for
children
and
for
adults
both
for
sick
and
for
well
although
more
certainly
in
the
case
of
sick
children
than
in
any
others
i
would
here
again
repeat
the
most
frequent
and
most
fatal
cause
of
all
is
sleeping
for
even
a
few
hours
much
more
for
weeks
and
months
in
foul
air
a
condition
which
more
than
any
other
condition
disturbs
the
respiratory
process
and
tends
to
produce
accidental
death
in
disease
i
need
hardly
here
repeat
the
warning
against
any
confusion
of
ideas
between
cold
and
fresh
air
you
may
chill
a
patient
fatally
without
giving
him
fresh
air
at
all
and
you
can
quite
well
nay
much
better
give
him
fresh
air
without
chilling
him
this
is
the
test
of
a
good
nurse
in
cases
of
long
recurring
faintnesses
from
disease
for
instance
especially
disease
which
affects
the
organs
of
breathing
fresh
air
to
the
lungs
warmth
to
the
surface
and
often
as
soon
as
the
patient
can
swallow
hot
drink
these
are
the
right
remedies
and
the
only
ones
yet
oftener
than
not
you
see
the
nurse
or
mother
just
reversing
this
shutting
up
every
cranny
through
which
fresh
air
can
enter
and
leaving
the
body
cold
or
perhaps
throwing
a
greater
weight
of
clothes
upon
it
when
already
it
is
generating
too
little
heat
breathing
carefully
anxiously
as
though
respiration
were
a
function
which
required
all
the
attention
for
its
performance
is
cited
as
a
not
unusual
state
in
children
and
as
one
calling
for
care
in
all
the
things
enumerated
above
that
breathing
becomes
an
almost
voluntary
act
even
in
grown
up
patients
who
are
very
weak
must
often
have
been
remarked
disease
having
interfered
with
the
perfect
accomplishment
of
the
respiratory
function
some
sudden
demand
for
its
complete
exercise
issues
in
the
sudden
standstill
of
the
whole
machinery
is
given
as
one
process
life
goes
out
for
want
of
nervous
power
to
keep
the
vital
functions
in
activity
is
given
as
another
by
which
accidental
death
is
most
often
brought
to
pass
in
infancy
also
in
middle
age
both
these
processes
may
be
seen
ending
in
death
although
generally
not
suddenly
and
i
have
seen
even
in
middle
age
the
here
mentioned
and
from
the
same
causes
sidenote
summary
to
sum
up
the
answer
to
two
of
the
commonest
objections
urged
one
by
women
themselves
the
other
by
men
against
the
desirableness
of
sanitary
knowledge
for
women
a
caution
comprises
the
whole
argument
for
the
art
of
nursing
sidenote
reckless
amateur
physicking
by
women
real
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
health
alone
can
check
this
it
is
often
said
by
men
that
it
is
unwise
to
teach
women
anything
about
these
laws
of
health
because
they
will
take
to
physicking
that
there
is
a
great
deal
too
much
of
amateur
physicking
as
it
is
which
is
indeed
true
one
eminent
physician
told
me
that
he
had
known
more
calomel
given
both
at
a
pinch
and
for
a
continuance
by
mothers
governesses
and
nurses
to
children
than
he
had
ever
heard
of
a
physician
prescribing
in
all
his
experience
another
says
that
only
idea
in
medicine
is
calomel
and
aperients
this
is
undeniably
too
often
the
case
there
is
nothing
ever
seen
in
any
professional
practice
like
the
reckless
physicking
by
amateur
females
but
this
is
just
what
the
really
experienced
and
observing
nurse
does
do
she
neither
physics
herself
nor
others
and
to
cultivate
in
things
pertaining
to
health
observation
and
experience
in
women
who
are
mothers
governesses
or
nurses
is
just
the
way
to
do
away
with
amateur
physicking
and
if
the
doctors
did
but
know
it
to
make
the
nurses
obedient
to
them
helps
to
them
instead
of
hindrances
such
education
in
women
would
indeed
diminish
the
doctor
work
but
no
one
really
believes
that
doctors
wish
that
there
should
be
more
illness
in
order
to
have
more
work
sidenote
what
pathology
teaches
what
observation
alone
teaches
what
medicine
does
what
nature
alone
does
it
is
often
said
by
women
that
they
can
not
know
anything
of
the
laws
of
health
or
what
to
do
to
preserve
their
children
health
because
they
can
know
nothing
of
pathology
or
can
not
dissect
a
confusion
of
ideas
which
it
is
hard
to
attempt
to
disentangle
pathology
teaches
the
harm
that
disease
has
done
but
it
teaches
nothing
more
we
know
nothing
of
the
principle
of
health
the
positive
of
which
pathology
is
the
negative
except
from
observation
and
experience
and
nothing
but
observation
and
experience
will
teach
us
the
ways
to
maintain
or
to
bring
back
the
state
of
health
it
is
often
thought
that
medicine
is
the
curative
process
it
is
no
such
thing
medicine
is
the
surgery
of
functions
as
surgery
proper
is
that
of
limbs
and
organs
neither
can
do
anything
but
remove
obstructions
neither
can
cure
nature
alone
cures
surgery
removes
the
bullet
out
of
the
limb
which
is
an
obstruction
to
cure
but
nature
heals
the
wound
so
it
is
with
medicine
the
function
of
an
organ
becomes
obstructed
medicine
so
far
as
we
know
assists
nature
to
remove
the
obstruction
but
does
nothing
more
and
what
nursing
has
to
do
in
either
case
is
to
put
the
patient
in
the
best
condition
for
nature
to
act
upon
him
generally
just
the
contrary
is
done
you
think
fresh
air
and
quiet
and
cleanliness
extravagant
perhaps
dangerous
luxuries
which
should
be
given
to
the
patient
only
when
quite
convenient
and
medicine
the
quâ
the
panacea
if
i
have
succeeded
in
any
measure
in
dispelling
this
illusion
and
in
showing
what
true
nursing
is
and
what
it
is
not
my
object
will
have
been
answered
now
for
the
caution
it
seems
a
commonly
received
idea
among
men
and
even
among
women
themselves
that
it
requires
nothing
but
a
disappointment
in
love
the
want
of
an
object
a
general
disgust
or
incapacity
for
other
things
to
turn
a
woman
into
a
good
nurse
this
reminds
one
of
the
parish
where
a
stupid
old
man
was
set
to
be
schoolmaster
because
he
was
past
keeping
the
pigs
apply
the
above
receipt
for
making
a
good
nurse
to
making
a
good
servant
and
the
receipt
will
be
found
to
fail
yet
popular
novelists
of
recent
days
have
invented
ladies
disappointed
in
love
or
fresh
out
of
the
turning
into
the
to
find
their
wounded
lovers
and
when
found
forthwith
abandoning
their
for
their
lover
as
might
be
expected
yet
in
the
estimation
of
the
authors
these
ladies
were
none
the
worse
for
that
but
on
the
contrary
were
heroines
of
nursing
what
cruel
mistakes
are
sometimes
made
by
benevolent
men
and
women
in
matters
of
business
about
which
they
can
know
nothing
and
think
they
know
a
great
deal
the
everyday
management
of
a
large
ward
let
alone
of
a
hospital
the
knowing
what
are
the
laws
of
life
and
death
for
men
and
what
the
laws
of
health
for
wards
and
wards
are
healthy
or
unhealthy
mainly
according
to
the
knowledge
or
ignorance
of
the
nurse
are
not
these
matters
of
sufficient
importance
and
difficulty
to
require
learning
by
experience
and
careful
inquiry
just
as
much
as
any
other
art
they
do
not
come
by
inspiration
to
the
lady
disappointed
in
love
nor
to
the
poor
workhouse
drudge
hard
up
for
a
livelihood
and
terrible
is
the
injury
which
has
followed
to
the
sick
from
such
wild
notions
in
this
respect
and
why
is
it
so
in
roman
catholic
countries
both
writers
and
workers
are
in
theory
at
least
far
before
ours
they
would
never
think
of
such
a
beginning
for
a
good
working
superior
or
sister
of
charity
and
many
a
superior
has
refused
to
admit
a
who
appeared
to
have
no
better
vocation
or
reasons
for
offering
herself
than
these
it
is
true
make
no
vows
but
is
a
vow
necessary
to
convince
us
that
the
true
spirit
for
learning
any
art
most
especially
an
art
of
charity
aright
is
not
a
disgust
to
everything
or
something
else
do
we
really
place
the
love
of
our
kind
and
of
nursing
as
one
branch
of
it
so
low
as
this
what
would
the
mère
angélique
of
port
royal
what
would
our
own
fry
have
said
to
this
i
would
earnestly
ask
my
sisters
to
keep
clear
of
both
the
jargons
now
current
everywhere
for
they
equally
jargons
of
the
jargon
namely
about
the
rights
of
women
which
urges
women
to
do
all
that
men
do
including
the
medical
and
other
professions
merely
because
men
do
it
and
without
regard
to
whether
this
the
best
that
women
can
do
and
of
the
jargon
which
urges
women
to
do
nothing
that
men
do
merely
because
they
are
women
and
should
be
recalled
to
a
sense
of
their
duty
as
women
and
because
this
is
women
work
and
that
is
men
and
these
are
things
which
women
should
not
do
which
is
all
assertion
and
nothing
more
surely
woman
should
bring
the
best
she
has
that
is
to
the
work
of
god
world
without
attending
to
either
of
these
cries
for
what
are
they
both
of
them
the
one
as
much
as
the
other
but
listening
to
the
what
people
will
say
to
opinion
to
the
voices
from
without
and
as
a
wise
man
has
said
no
one
has
ever
done
anything
great
or
useful
by
listening
to
the
voices
from
without
you
do
not
want
the
effect
of
your
good
things
to
be
how
wonderful
for
a
nor
would
you
be
deterred
from
good
things
by
hearing
it
said
yes
but
she
ought
not
to
have
done
this
because
it
is
not
suitable
for
a
woman
but
you
want
to
do
the
thing
that
is
good
whether
it
is
suitable
for
a
woman
or
not
it
does
not
make
a
thing
good
that
it
is
remarkable
that
a
woman
should
have
been
able
to
do
it
neither
does
it
make
a
thing
bad
which
would
have
been
good
had
a
man
done
it
that
it
has
been
done
by
a
woman
oh
leave
these
jargons
and
go
your
way

to
make
as
many
of
them
as
possible
the
disciples
of
the
true
doctrines
of
health
would
be
a
great
national
work
for
there
the
material
exists
and
will
be
used
for
nursing
whether
the
real
conclusion
of
the
matter
be
to
nurse
or
to
poison
the
sick
a
man
who
stands
perhaps
at
the
head
of
our
medical
profession
once
said
to
me
i
send
a
nurse
into
a
private
family
to
nurse
the
sick
but
i
know
that
it
is
only
to
do
them
harm
now
a
nurse
means
any
person
in
charge
of
the
personal
health
of
another
and
in
the
preceding
notes
the
term
is
used
indiscriminately
for
amateur
and
professional
nurses
for
besides
nurses
of
the
sick
and
nurses
of
children
the
numbers
of
whom
are
here
given
there
are
friends
or
relations
who
take
temporary
charge
of
a
sick
person
there
are
mothers
of
families
it
appears
as
if
these
unprofessional
nurses
were
just
as
much
in
want
of
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
health
as
professional
ones
then
there
are
the
of
all
national
and
other
schools
throughout
the
kingdom
how
many
of
children
epidemics
originate
in
these
then
the
proportion
of
girls
in
these
schools
who
become
mothers
or
members
among
the
nurses
recorded
above
or
schoolmistresses
in
their
turn
if
the
laws
of
health
as
far
as
regards
fresh
air
cleanliness
light
were
taught
to
these
would
this
not
prevent
some
children
being
killed
some
evil
being
perpetuated
on
women
we
must
depend
first
and
last
for
personal
and
household
hygiene
for
preventing
the
race
from
degenerating
in
as
far
as
these
things
are
concerned
would
not
the
true
way
of
infusing
the
art
of
preserving
its
own
health
into
the
human
race
be
to
teach
the
female
part
of
it
in
schools
and
hospitals
both
by
practical
teaching
and
by
simple
experiments
in
as
far
as
these
illustrate
what
may
be
called
the
theory
of
it
footnotes
sidenote
curious
deductions
from
an
excessive
death
rate
upon
this
fact
the
most
wonderful
deductions
have
been
strung
for
a
long
time
an
announcement
something
like
the
following
has
been
going
the
round
of
the
papers
more
than
children
die
every
year
in
london
under
years
of
age
therefore
we
want
a
children
hospital
this
spring
there
was
a
prospectus
issued
and
divers
other
means
taken
to
this
effect
there
is
a
great
want
of
sanitary
knowledge
in
women
therefore
we
want
a
women
hospital
now
both
the
above
facts
are
too
sadly
true
but
what
is
the
deduction
the
causes
of
the
enormous
child
mortality
are
perfectly
well
known
they
are
chiefly
want
of
cleanliness
want
of
ventilation
want
of
in
one
word
defective
hygiene
the
remedies
are
just
as
well
known
and
among
them
is
certainly
not
the
establishment
of
a
child
hospital
this
may
be
a
want
just
as
there
may
be
a
want
of
hospital
room
for
adults
but
the
would
certainly
never
think
of
giving
us
as
a
cause
for
the
high
rate
of
child
mortality
in
say
liverpool
that
there
was
not
sufficient
hospital
room
for
children
nor
would
he
urge
upon
us
as
a
remedy
to
found
a
hospital
for
them
again
women
and
the
best
women
are
wofully
deficient
in
sanitary
knowledge
although
it
is
to
women
that
we
must
look
first
and
last
for
its
application
as
far
as
hygiene
is
concerned
but
who
would
ever
think
of
citing
the
institution
of
a
women
hospital
as
the
way
to
cure
this
want
we
have
it
indeed
upon
very
high
authority
that
there
is
some
fear
lest
hospitals
as
they
have
been
may
not
have
generally
increased
rather
than
diminished
the
rate
of
mortality
especially
of
child
mortality
sidenote
why
are
uninhabited
rooms
shut
up
the
common
idea
as
to
uninhabited
rooms
is
that
they
may
safely
be
left
with
doors
windows
shutters
and
chimney
board
all
closed
hermetically
sealed
if
possible
to
keep
out
the
dust
it
is
said
and
that
no
harm
will
happen
if
the
room
is
but
opened
a
short
hour
before
the
inmates
are
put
in
i
have
often
been
asked
the
question
for
uninhabited
rooms
but
when
ought
the
windows
to
be
opened
the
answer
is
when
ought
they
to
be
shut
it
is
very
desirable
that
the
windows
in
a
sick
room
should
be
such
as
that
the
patient
shall
if
he
can
move
about
be
able
to
open
and
shut
them
easily
himself
in
fact
the
sick
room
is
very
seldom
kept
aired
if
this
is
not
the
case
so
very
few
people
have
any
perception
of
what
is
a
healthy
atmosphere
for
the
sick
the
sick
man
often
says
this
room
where
i
spend
hours
out
of
the

fresher
than
the
other
where
i
only
spend

here
i
can

if
it
could
be
made
of
simpler
application
would
be
invaluable
to
use
in
every
sleeping
and
sick
room
just
as
without
the
use
of
a
thermometer
no
nurse
should
ever
put
a
patient
into
a
bath
so
should
no
nurse
or
mother
or
superintendent
be
without
the
air
test
in
any
ward
nursery
or
if
the
main
function
of
a
nurse
is
to
maintain
the
air
within
the
room
as
fresh
as
the
air
without
without
lowering
the
temperature
then
she
should
always
be
provided
with
a
thermometer
which
indicates
the
temperature
with
an
air
test
which
indicates
the
organic
matter
of
the
air
but
to
be
used
the
latter
must
be
made
as
simple
a
little
instrument
as
the
former
and
both
should
be
the
senses
of
nurses
and
mothers
become
so
dulled
to
foul
air
that
they
are
perfectly
unconscious
of
what
an
atmosphere
they
have
let
their
children
patients
or
charges
sleep
in

if
the
were
to
exhibit
in
the
morning
both
to
nurses
and
patients
and
to
the
superior
officer
going
round
what
the
atmosphere
has
been
during
the

i
question
if
any
greater
security
could
be
afforded
against
a
recurrence
of
the
misdemeanour
and
oh

crowded

where
so
many
children

have
their

would
be
no
more
ascribed
to
contagion
but
to
its

should
hear
no
longer

of

so

as
we
know
he
has
put
them
into
our
own

both
betray
the
cause
of
these
mysterious
pestilences
and
call
upon
us
to

it

but
certainly
with

the

should
never
be
satisfied
as
to
the
freshness
of
their
atmosphere
unless
she
can
feel
the

gently
moving
over
her
face
when
still
but
it
is
often
observed
that
nurses
who
make
the
greatest
outcry
against
open

are
those
who
take
the
least
pains

prevent

the
careful
nurse
will
keep
the
door
shut
while
she
shuts
the
windows
and
then
and
not
before
set
the
door
open
so
that
a
patient
may
not
be
left
sitting
up
in
bed
perhaps
in
a
profuse
perspiration
directly
in
the

between
the
open

and

neither
of

should
a

while

exposed
remain

were
worth

i
stand
and
i
solemnly
declare
that
i
have
seen
or
know
of
fatal
accidents
such
as
suicides
in
bleedings
to
death
dying
patients
dragged
out
of
bed
by
drunken
medical
staff
corps
men
and
many
other
things
less
patent
and
striking
which
would
not
have
happened
in
london
civil
hospitals
nursed
by
women
the
medical
officers
should
be
absolved
from
all
blame
in
these
accidents
how
can
a
medical
officer
mount
guard
all
day
and
all
night
over
a
patient
say
in
the
fault
lies
in
there
being
no
organized
system
of
attendance
were
a
trustworthy
in
charge
of
each
ward
or
set
of
wards
not
as
office
clerk
but
as
head
nurse
and
head
nurse
the
best
hospital
serjeant
or
ward
master
is
not
now
and
can
not
be
from
default
of
the
proper
regulations
the
thing
would
not
in
all
probability
have
happened
but
were
a
trustworthy
in
charge
of
the
ward
or
set
of
wards
the
thing
would
not
in
all
certainty
have
happened
in
other
words
it
does
not
happen
where
a
trustworthy
woman
is
really
in
charge
and
in
these
remarks
i
by
no
means
refer
only
to
exceptional
times
of
great
emergency
in
war
hospitals
but
also
and
quite
as
much
to
the
ordinary
run
of
military
hospitals
at
home
in
time
of
peace
or
to
a
time
in
war
when
our
army
was
actually
more
healthy
than
at
home
in
peace
and
the
pressure
on
our
hospitals
consequently
much
less
sidenote
nursing
in
regimental
hospitals
it
is
often
said
that
in
regimental
hospitals
patients
ought
to
nurse
each
other
because
the
number
of
sick
altogether
being
say
but
thirty
and
out
of
these
one
only
perhaps
being
seriously
ill
and
the
other
having
little
the
matter
with
them
and
nothing
to
do
they
should
be
set
to
nurse
the
one
also
that
soldiers
are
so
trained
to
obey
that
they
will
be
the
most
obedient
and
therefore
the
best
of
nurses
add
to
which
they
are
always
kind
to
their
comrades
now
have
those
who
say
this
considered
that
in
order
to
obey
you
must
know
to
obey
and
that
these
soldiers
certainly
do
not
know
how
to
obey
in
nursing
i
have
seen
these
kind
fellows
and
how
kind
they
are
no
one
knows
so
well
as
myself
move
a
comrade
so
that
in
one
case
at
least
the
man
died
in
the
act
i
have
seen
the
kindness
produce
abundance
of
spirits
to
be
drunk
in
secret
let
no
one
understand
by
this
that
female
nurses
ought
to
or
could
be
introduced
in
regimental
hospitals
it
would
be
most
undesirable
even
were
it
not
impossible
but
the
head
nurseship
of
a
hospital
serjeant
is
the
more
essential
the
more
important
the
more
inexperienced
the
nurses
undoubtedly
a
london
hospital
sister
does
sometimes
set
relays
of
patients
to
watch
a
critical
case
but
undoubtedly
also
always
under
her
own
superintendence
and
she
is
called
to
whenever
there
is
something
to
be
done
and
she
knows
how
to
do
it
the
patients
are
not
left
to
do
it
of
their
own
unassisted
genius
however
kind
and
willing
they
may
be
sidenote
burning
of
the
crinolines
fortunate
it
is
if
her
skirts
do
not
catch
fire
and
if
the
nurse
does
not
give
herself
up
a
sacrifice
together
with
her
patient
to
be
burnt
in
her
own
petticoats
i
wish
the
would
tell
us
the
exact
number
of
deaths
by
burning
occasioned
by
this
absurd
and
hideous
custom
but
if
people
will
be
stupid
let
them
take
measures
to
protect
themselves
from
their
own
stupidity
measures
which
every
chemist
knows
such
as
putting
alum
into
starch
which
prevents
starched
articles
of
dress
from
blazing
up
sidenote
indecency
of
the
crinolines
i
wish
too
that
people
who
wear
crinoline
could
see
the
indecency
of
their
own
dress
as
other
people
see
it
a
respectable
elderly
woman
stooping
forward
invested
in
crinoline
exposes
quite
as
much
of
her
own
person
to
the
patient
lying
in
the
room
as
any
does
on
the
stage
but
no
one
will
ever
tell
her
this
unpleasant
truth
sidenote
never
speak
to
a
patient
in
the
act
of
moving
it
is
absolutely
essential
that
a
nurse
should
lay
this
down
as
a
positive
rule
to
herself
never
to
speak
to
any
patient
who
is
standing
or
moving
as
long
as
she
exercises
so
little
observation
as
not
to
know
when
a
patient
can
not
bear
it
i
am
satisfied
that
many
of
the
accidents
which
happen
from
feeble
patients
tumbling
down
stairs
fainting
after
getting
up
happen
solely
from
the
nurse
popping
out
of
a
door
to
speak
to
the
patient
just
at
that
moment
or
from
his
fearing
that
she
will
do
so
and
that
if
the
patient
were
even
left
to
himself
till
he
can
sit
down
such
accidents
would
much
seldomer
occur
if
the
nurse
accompanies
the
patient
let
her
not
call
upon
him
to
speak
it
is
incredible
that
nurses
can
not
picture
to
themselves
the
strain
upon
the
heart
the
lungs
and
the
brain
which
the
act
of
moving
is
to
any
feeble
patient
sidenote
careless
observation
of
the
results
of
careless
visits
as
an
old
experienced
nurse
i
do
most
earnestly
deprecate
all
such
careless
words
i
have
known
patients
delirious
all
night
after
seeing
a
visitor
who
called
them
better
thought
they
only
wanted
a
little
amusement
and
who
came
again
saying
i
hope
you
were
not
the
worse
for
my
visit
neither
waiting
for
an
answer
nor
even
looking
at
the
case
no
real
patient
will
ever
say
yes
but
i
was
a
great
deal
the
worse
it
is
not
however
either
death
or
delirium
of
which
in
these
cases
there
is
most
danger
to
the
patient
unperceived
consequences
are
far
more
likely
to
ensue
will
have
impunity
the
poor
patient
will
that
is
the
patient
will
suffer
although
neither
he
nor
the
inflictor
of
the
injury
will
attribute
it
to
its
real
cause
it
will
not
be
directly
traceable
except
by
a
very
careful
observant
nurse
the
patient
will
often
not
even
mention
what
has
done
him
most
harm
sidenote
the
sick
would
rather
be
told
a
thing
than
have
it
read
to
them
sick
children
if
not
too
shy
to
speak
will
always
express
this
wish
they
invariably
prefer
a
story
to
be
to
them
rather
than
read
to
them
sidenote
sick
suffer
to
excess
from
mental
as
well
as
bodily
pain
it
is
a
matter
of
painful
wonder
to
the
sick
themselves
how
much
painful
ideas
predominate
over
pleasurable
ones
in
their
impressions
they
reason
with
themselves
they
think
themselves
ungrateful
it
is
all
of
no
use
the
fact
is
that
these
painful
impressions
are
far
better
dismissed
by
a
real
laugh
if
you
can
excite
one
by
books
or
conversation
than
by
any
direct
reasoning
or
if
the
patient
is
too
weak
to
laugh
some
impression
from
nature
is
what
he
wants
i
have
mentioned
the
cruelty
of
letting
him
stare
at
a
dead
wall
in
many
diseases
especially
in
convalescence
from
fever
that
wall
will
appear
to
make
all
sorts
of
faces
at
him
now
flowers
never
do
this
form
colour
will
free
your
patient
from
his
painful
ideas
better
than
any
argument
sidenote
desperate
desire
in
the
sick
to
see
out
of
window
i
remember
a
case
in
point
a
man
received
an
injury
to
the
spine
from
an
accident
which
after
a
long
confinement
ended
in
death
he
was
a
workman
had
not
in
his
composition
a
single
grain
of
what
is
called
enthusiasm
for
nature
but
he
was
desperate
to
see
once
more
out
of
window
his
nurse
actually
got
him
on
her
back
and
managed
to
perch
him
up
at
the
window
for
an
instant
to
see
out
the
consequence
to
the
poor
nurse
was
a
serious
illness
which
nearly
proved
fatal
the
man
never
knew
it
but
a
great
many
other
people
did
yet
the
consequence
in
none
of
their
minds
so
far
as
i
know
was
the
conviction
that
the
craving
for
variety
in
the
starving
eye
is
just
as
desperate
as
that
for
food
in
the
starving
stomach
and
tempts
the
famishing
creature
in
either
case
to
steal
for
its
satisfaction
no
other
word
will
express
it
but
desperation
and
it
sets
the
seal
of
ignorance
and
stupidity
just
as
much
on
the
governors
and
attendants
of
the
sick
if
they
do
not
provide
the
with
a
view
of
some
kind
as
if
they
did
not
provide
the
hospital
with
a
kitchen
sidenote
physical
effect
of
colour
no
one
who
has
watched
the
sick
can
doubt
the
fact
that
some
feel
stimulus
from
looking
at
scarlet
flowers
exhaustion
from
looking
at
deep
blue
sidenote
nurse
must
have
some
rule
of
time
about
the
patient
diet
why
because
the
nurse
has
not
got
some
food
which
the
patient
takes
can
the
patient
wait
four
hours
for
food
who
could
not
wait
two
hours
yesterday
yet
this
is
the
only
logic
one
generally
hears
on
the
other
hand
the
other
logic
of
the
nurse
giving
a
patient
a
thing
because
she
got
it
is
equally
fatal
if
she
happens
to
have
fresh
jelly
or
fresh
fruit
she
will
frequently
give
it
to
the
patient
after
his
dinner
or
at
his
dinner
when
he
can
not
possibly
eat
that
and
the
broth
too
or
worse
still
leave
it
by
his
till
he
is
so
sickened
with
the
sight
of
it
that
he
can
not
eat
it
at
all
sidenote
intelligent
cravings
of
particular
sick
for
particular
articles
of
diet
in
the
diseases
produced
by
bad
food
such
as
scorbutic
dysentery
and
diarrhoea
the
patient
stomach
often
craves
for
and
digests
things
some
of
which
certainly
would
be
laid
down
in
no
dietary
that
ever
was
invented
for
sick
and
especially
not
for
such
sick
these
are
fruit
pickles
jams
gingerbread
fat
of
ham
or
of
bacon
suet
cheese
butter
milk
these
cases
i
have
seen
not
by
ones
nor
by
tens
but
by
hundreds
and
the
patient
stomach
was
right
and
the
book
was
wrong
the
articles
craved
for
in
these
cases
might
have
been
principally
arranged
under
the
two
heads
of
fat
and
vegetable
acids
there
is
often
a
marked
difference
between
men
and
women
in
this
matter
of
sick
feeding
women
digestion
is
generally
slower
it
is
made
a
frequent
recommendation
to
persons
about
to
incur
great
exhaustion
either
from
the
nature
of
the
service
or
from
their
being
not
in
a
state
fit
for
it
to
eat
a
piece
of
bread
before
they
go
i
wish
the
recommenders
would
themselves
try
the
experiment
of
substituting
a
piece
of
bread
for
a
cup
of
tea
or
coffee
or
beef
tea
as
a
refresher
they
would
find
it
a
very
poor
comfort
when
soldiers
have
to
set
out
fasting
on
fatiguing
duty
when
nurses
have
to
go
fasting
in
to
their
patients
it
is
a
hot
restorative
they
want
and
ought
to
have
before
they
go
not
a
cold
bit
of
bread
and
dreadful
have
been
the
consequences
of
neglecting
this
if
they
can
take
a
bit
of
bread
the
hot
cup
of
tea
so
much
the
better
but
not
of
it
the
fact
that
there
is
more
nourishment
in
bread
than
in
almost
anything
else
has
probably
induced
the
mistake
that
it
is
a
fatal
mistake
there
is
no
doubt
it
seems
though
very
little
is
known
on
the
subject
that
what
assimilates
itself
directly
and
with
the
least
trouble
of
digestion
with
the
human
body
is
the
best
for
the
above
circumstances
bread
requires
two
or
three
processes
of
assimilation
before
it
becomes
like
the
human
body
the
almost
universal
testimony
of
english
men
and
women
who
have
undergone
great
fatigue
such
as
riding
long
journeys
without
stopping
or
sitting
up
for
several
nights
in
succession
is
that
they
could
do
it
best
upon
an
occasional
cup
of
tea
and
nothing
else
let
experience
not
theory
decide
upon
this
as
upon
all
other
things
in
making
coffee
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
buy
it
in
the
berry
and
grind
it
at
home
otherwise
you
may
reckon
upon
its
containing
a
certain
amount
of
chicory
this
is
not
a
question
of
the
taste
or
of
the
wholesomeness
of
chicory
it
is
that
chicory
has
nothing
at
all
of
the
properties
for
which
you
give
coffee
and
therefore
you
may
as
well
not
give
it
again
all
laundresses
mistresses
of
head
nurses
i
speak
of
the
good
old
sort
only
women
who
unite
a
good
deal
of
hard
manual
labour
with
the
necessary
for
arranging
the
day
business
so
that
none
of
it
shall
tread
upon
the
heels
of
something
else
set
great
value
i
have
observed
upon
having
a
tea
this
is
called
extravagant
but
these
women
are
extravagant
in
nothing
else
and
they
are
right
in
this
real
tea
alone
contains
the
restorative
they
want
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
tea
the
mistresses
of
houses
who
can
not
even
go
over
their
own
house
once
a
day
are
incapable
of
judging
for
these
women
for
they
are
incapable
themselves
to
all
appearance
of
the
spirit
of
arrangement
no
small
task
necessary
for
managing
a
large
ward
or
dairy
sidenote
nurses
often
do
not
think
the
sick
room
any
business
of
theirs
but
only
the
sick
i
once
told
a
very
good
nurse
that
the
way
in
which
her
patient
room
was
kept
was
quite
enough
to
account
for
his
sleeplessness
and
she
answered
quite
she
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
it
as
if
the
state
of
the
room
were
like
the
state
of
the
weather
entirely
out
of
her
power
now
in
what
sense
was
this
woman
to
be
called
a
nurse
for
the
same
reason
if
after
washing
a
patient
you
must
put
the
same
on
him
again
always
give
it
a
preliminary
warm
at
the
fire
the
he
has
worn
must
be
to
a
certain
extent
damp
it
has
now
got
cold
from
having
been
off
him
for
a
few
minutes

fire
will
dry
and
at
the
same
time

is
much
more
important
than
with
clean
things

how
a
room
is
if
you
like
to
clean
your
furniture
by
laying
out
your
clean
clothes
upon
your
dirty
chairs
or
sofa
this
is
one
way
certainly
of
doing
it
having
witnessed
the
morning
process
called
tidying
the
room
for
many
years
and
with
astonishment
i
can
describe
what
it
is
from
the
chairs
tables
or
sofa
upon
which
the
things
have
lain
during
the
night
and
which
are
therefore
comparatively
clean
from
dust
or
blacks
the
poor
having
caught
it
they
are
removed
to
other
chairs

upon
which
you
could
write
your
name
with
your
finger
in
the

the

is
therefore
now

am
sure
that
a
person
who
has
accustomed
her

atmospheres
proper
and
improper
for
the
sick
and
for
children
could
tell
blindfold
the
difference
of
the
air
in

in
old

the

will
always
be
musty
even
with
all

how
to

your

at
the

if
you
like
to
wipe
your

door
or
some
portion
of
your
dirty
wall
by
hanging
up
your
clean
gown
or
shawl
against
it
on
a
peg
this
is
one
way
certainly
and
the
most
usual

generally
the
only

there
is
nothing
unusual
in
her
case
that
she
has
nothing
to
fear
but
a
few
hours
pain
may
cheer
her
most
effectually
this
is
advice
of
quite
another
order
it
is
the
advice
of
experience
to
utter
inexperience
but
the
advice
we
have
been
referring
to
is
the
advice
of
inexperience
to
bitter
experience
and
in
general
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
this
that
think
shall
recover
from
consumption
because
somebody
knows
somebody
somewhere
who
has
recovered
from
fever
i
have
heard
a
doctor
condemned
whose
patient
did
not
alas
recover
because
another
doctor
patient
of
a
sex
of
a
age
recovered
from
a
disease
in
a
place
yes
this
is
really
true
if
people
who
make
these
comparisons
did
but
know
only
they
do
not
care
to
know
the
care
and
preciseness
with
which
such
comparisons
require
to
be
made
and
are
made
in
order
to
be
of
any
value
whatever
they
would
spare
their
tongues
in
comparing
the
deaths
of
one
hospital
with
those
of
another
any
statistics
are
justly
considered
absolutely
valueless
which
do
not
give
the
ages
the
sexes
and
the
diseases
of
all
the
cases
it
does
not
seem
necessary
to
mention
this
it
does
not
seem
necessary
to
say
that
there
can
be
no
comparison
between
old
men
with
dropsies
and
young
women
with
consumptions
yet
the
cleverest
men
and
the
cleverest
women
are
often
heard
making
such
comparisons
ignoring
entirely
sex
age
disease
place
in
fact
the
conditions
essential
to
the
question
it
is
the
merest
a
small
pet
animal
is
often
an
excellent
companion
for
the
sick
for
long
chronic
cases
especially
a
pet
bird
in
a
cage
is
sometimes
the
only
pleasure
of
an
invalid
confined
for
years
to
the
same
room
if
he
can
feed
and
clean
the
animal
himself
he
ought
always
to
be
encouraged
to
do
so
it
is
a
much
more
difficult
thing
to
speak
the
truth
than
people
commonly
imagine
there
is
the
want
of
observation
and
the
want
of
observation
compounded
that
is
with
the
imaginative
faculty
both
may
equally
intend
to
speak
the
truth
the
information
of
the
first
is
simply
defective
that
of
the
second
is
much
more
dangerous
the
first
gives
in
answer
to
a
question
asked
about
a
thing
that
has
been
before
his
eyes
perhaps
for
years
information
exceedingly
imperfect
or
says
he
does
not
know
he
has
never
observed
and
people
simply
think
him
stupid
the
second
has
observed
just
as
little
but
imagination
immediately
steps
in
and
he
describes
the
whole
thing
from
imagination
merely
being
perfectly
convinced
all
the
while
that
he
has
seen
or
heard
it
or
he
will
repeat
a
whole
conversation
as
if
it
were
information
which
had
been
addressed
to
him
whereas
it
is
merely
what
he
has
himself
said
to
somebody
else
this
is
the
commonest
of
all
these
people
do
not
even
observe
that
they
have
observed
nor
remember
that
they
have
forgotten
courts
of
justice
seem
to
think
that
any
body
can
speak
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
if
he
does
but
intend
it
it
requires
many
faculties
combined
of
observation
and
memory
to
speak
the
whole
truth
and
to
say
nothing
but
the
truth
i
knows
i
fibs
dreadful
but
believe
me
miss
i
never
finds
out
i
have
fibbed
until
they
tells
me
so
was
a
remark
actually
made
it
is
also
one
of
much
more
extended
application
than
most
people
have
the
least
idea
of
concurrence
of
testimony
which
is
so
often
adduced
as
final
proof
may
prove
nothing
more
as
is
well
known
to
those
accustomed
to
deal
with
the
unobservant
imaginative
than
that
one
person
has
told
his
story
a
great
many
times
i
have
heard
thirteen
persons
concur
in
declaring
that
a
fourteenth
who
had
never
left
his
bed
went
to
a
distant
chapel
every
morning
at
seven
i
have
heard
persons
in
perfect
good
faith
declare
that
a
man
came
to
dine
every
day
at
the
house
where
they
lived
who
had
never
dined
there
once
that
a
person
had
never
taken
the
sacrament
by
whose
side
they
had
twice
at
least
knelt
at
communion
that
but
one
meal
a
day
came
out
of
a
hospital
kitchen
which
for
six
weeks
they
had
seen
provide
from
three
to
five
and
six
meals
a
day
such
instances
might
be
multiplied
if
necessary
this
is
important
because
on
this
depends
what
the
remedy
will
be
if
a
patient
sleeps
two
or
three
hours
early
in
the
night
and
then
does
not
sleep
again
at
all
ten
to
one
it
is
not
a
narcotic
he
wants
but
food
or
stimulus
or
perhaps
only
warmth
if
on
the
other
hand
he
is
restless
and
awake
all
night
and
is
drowsy
in
the
morning
he
probably
wants
sedatives
either
quiet
coolness
or
medicine
a
lighter
diet
or
all
four
now
the
doctor
should
be
told
this
or
how
can
he
judge
what
to
give
sidenote
more
important
to
spare
the
patient
thought
than
physical
exertion
it
is
commonly
supposed
that
the
nurse
is
there
to
spare
the
patient
from
making
physical
exertion
for
himself
i
would
rather
say
that
she
ought
to
be
there
to
spare
him
from
taking
thought
for
himself
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
the
patient
were
spared
all
thought
for
himself
and
spared
all
physical
exertion
he
would
be
infinitely
the
gainer
the
reverse
is
generally
the
case
in
the
private
house
in
the
hospital
it
is
the
relief
from
all
anxiety
afforded
by
the
rules
of
a
institution
which
has
often
such
a
beneficial
effect
upon
the
patient
sidenote
english
women
have
great
capacity
of
but
little
practice
in
close
observation
it
may
be
too
broad
an
assertion
and
it
certainly
sounds
like
a
paradox
but
i
think
that
in
no
country
are
women
to
be
found
so
deficient
in
ready
and
sound
observation
as
in
england
while
peculiarly
capable
of
being
trained
to
it
the
french
or
irish
woman
is
too
quick
of
perception
to
be
so
sound
an
observer
the
teuton
is
too
slow
to
be
so
ready
an
observer
as
the
english
woman
might
be
yet
english
women
lay
themselves
open
to
the
charge
so
often
made
against
them
by
men
that
they
are
not
to
be
trusted
in
handicrafts
to
which
their
strength
is
quite
equal
for
want
of
a
practised
and
steady
observation
in
countries
where
women
with
average
intelligence
certainly
not
superior
to
that
of
englishwomen
are
employed
in
dispensing
men
responsible
for
what
these
women
do
not
theorizing
about
man
and
woman
missions
have
stated
that
they
preferred
the
service
of
women
to
that
of
men
as
being
more
exact
more
careful
and
incurring
fewer
mistakes
of
inadvertence
now
certainly
englishwomen
are
peculiarly
capable
of
attaining
to
this
i
remember
when
a
child
hearing
the
story
of
an
accident
related
by
some
one
who
sent
two
girls
to
fetch
a
bottle
of
salvolatile
from
her
room
mary
could
not
stir
she
said
fanny
ran
and
fetched
a
bottle
that
was
not
salvolatile
and
that
was
not
in
my
room
now
this
sort
of
thing
pursues
every
one
through
life
a
woman
is
asked
to
fetch
a
large
new
bound
red
book
lying
on
the
table
by
the
window
and
she
fetches
five
small
old
boarded
brown
books
lying
on
the
shelf
by
the
fire
and
this
though
she
has
put
that
room
to
rights
every
day
for
a
month
perhaps
and
must
have
observed
the
books
every
day
lying
in
the
same
places
for
a
month
if
she
had
any
observation
habitual
observation
is
the
more
necessary
when
any
sudden
call
arises
if
fanny
had
observed
the
bottle
of
salvolatile
in
the
room
every
day
she
was
there
she
would
more
probably
have
found
it
when
it
was
suddenly
wanted
there
are
two
causes
for
these
mistakes
of
inadvertence
a
want
of
ready
attention
only
part
of
the
request
is
heard
at
all
a
want
of
the
habit
of
observation
to
a
nurse
i
would
add
take
care
that
you
always
put
the
same
things
in
the
same
places
you
do
know
how
suddenly
you
may
be
called
on
some
day
to
find
something
and
may
not
be
able
to
remember
in
your
haste
where
you
yourself
had
put
it
if
your
memory
is
not
in
the
habit
of
seeing
the
thing
there
always
sidenote
approach
of
death
paleness
by
no
means
an
invariable
effect
as
we
find
in
novels
it
falls
to
few
ever
to
have
had
the
opportunity
of
observing
the
different
aspects
which
the
human
face
puts
on
at
the
sudden
approach
of
certain
forms
of
death
by
violence
and
as
it
is
a
knowledge
of
little
use
i
only
mention
it
here
as
being
the
most
startling
example
of
what
i
mean
in
the
nervous
temperament
the
face
becomes
pale
this
is
the
only
effect
in
the
sanguine
temperament
purple
in
the
bilious
yellow
or
every
manner
of
colour
in
patches
now
it
is
generally
supposed
that
paleness
is
the
one
indication
of
almost
any
violent
change
in
the
human
being
whether
from
terror
disease
or
anything
else
there
can
be
no
more
false
observation
granted
it
is
the
one
recognized
livery
as
i
have
said
in
novels
but
nowhere
else
i
have
known
two
cases
the
one
of
a
man
who
intentionally
and
repeatedly
displaced
a
dislocation
and
was
kept
and
petted
by
all
the
surgeons
the
other
of
one
who
was
pronounced
to
have
nothing
the
matter
with
him
there
being
no
organic
change
perceptible
but
who
died
within
the
week
in
both
these
cases
it
was
the
nurse
who
by
accurately
pointing
out
what
she
had
accurately
observed
to
the
doctors
saved
the
one
case
from
persevering
in
a
fraud
the
other
from
being
discharged
when
actually
in
a
dying
state
i
will
even
go
further
and
say
that
in
diseases
which
have
their
origin
in
the
feeble
or
irregular
action
of
some
function
and
not
in
organic
change
it
is
quite
an
accident
if
the
doctor
who
sees
the
case
only
once
a
day
and
generally
at
the
same
time
can
form
any
but
a
negative
idea
of
its
real
condition
in
the
middle
of
the
day
when
such
a
patient
has
been
refreshed
by
light
and
air
by
his
tea
his
beef
tea
and
his
brandy
by
hot
bottles
to
his
feet
by
being
washed
and
by
clean
linen
you
can
scarcely
believe
that
he
is
the
same
person
as
lay
with
a
rapid
fluttering
pulse
with
puffed
with
short
breath
cold
limbs
and
unsteady
hands
this
morning
now
what
is
a
nurse
to
do
in
such
a
case
not
cry
lord
bless
you
sir
why
you
have
thought
he
were
a
dying
all
night
this
may
be
true
but
it
is
not
the
way
to
impress
with
the
truth
a
doctor
more
capable
of
forming
a
judgment
from
the
facts
if
he
did
but
know
them
than
you
are
what
he
wants
is
not
your
opinion
however
respectfully
given
but
your
facts
in
all
diseases
it
is
important
but
in
diseases
which
do
not
run
a
distinct
and
fixed
course
it
is
not
only
important
it
is
essential
that
the
facts
the
nurse
alone
can
observe
should
be
accurately
observed
and
accurately
reported
to
the
doctor
i
must
direct
the
nurse
attention
to
the
extreme
variation
there
is
not
unfrequently
in
the
pulse
of
such
patients
during
the
day
a
very
common
case
is
this
between
and
the
pulse
becomes
quick
perhaps
and
so
thready
it
is
not
like
a
pulse
at
all
but
like
a
string
vibrating
just
underneath
the
skin
after
this
the
patient
gets
no
more
sleep
about
the
pulse
has
come
down
to
and
though
feeble
and
compressible
is
a
very
respectable
pulse
at
night
if
the
patient
has
had
a
day
of
excitement
it
is
almost
imperceptible
but
if
the
patient
has
had
a
good
day
it
is
stronger
and
steadier
and
not
quicker
than
at
this
is
a
common
history
of
a
common
pulse
and
others
equally
varying
during
the
day
might
be
given
now
in
inflammation
which
may
almost
always
be
detected
by
the
pulse
in
typhoid
fever
which
is
accompanied
by
the
low
pulse
that
nothing
will
raise
there
is
no
such
great
variation
and
doctors
and
nurses
become
accustomed
not
to
look
for
it
the
doctor
indeed
can
not
but
the
variation
is
in
itself
an
important
feature
cases
like
the
above
often
go
off
rather
suddenly
as
it
is
called
from
some
trifling
ailment
of
a
few
days
which
just
makes
up
the
sum
of
exhaustion
necessary
to
produce
death
and
everybody
cries
who
would
have
thought
it
except
the
observing
nurse
if
there
is
one
who
had
always
expected
the
exhaustion
to
come
from
which
there
would
be
no
rally
because
she
knew
the
patient
had
no
capital
in
strength
on
which
to
draw
if
he
failed
for
a
few
days
to
make
his
barely
daily
income
in
sleep
and
nutrition
i
have
often
seen
really
good
nurses
distressed
because
they
could
not
impress
the
doctor
with
the
real
danger
of
their
patient
and
quite
provoked
because
the
patient
would
look
either
so
much
better
or
so
much
worse
than
he
really
is
when
the
doctor
was
there
the
distress
is
very
legitimate
but
it
generally
arises
from
the
nurse
not
having
the
power
of
laying
clearly
and
shortly
before
the
doctor
the
facts
from
which
she
derives
her
opinion
or
from
the
doctor
being
hasty
and
inexperienced
and
not
capable
of
eliciting
them
a
man
who
really
cares
for
his
patients
will
soon
learn
to
ask
for
and
appreciate
the
information
of
a
nurse
who
is
at
once
a
careful
observer
and
a
clear
reporter
sidenote
danger
of
physicking
by
amateur
females
i
have
known
many
ladies
who
having
once
obtained
a
blue
pill
prescription
from
a
physician
gave
and
took
it
as
a
common
aperient
two
or
three
times
a
week
with
what
effect
may
be
supposed
in
one
case
i
happened
to
be
the
person
to
inform
the
physician
of
it
who
substituted
for
the
prescription
a
comparatively
harmless
aperient
pill
the
lady
came
to
me
and
complained
that
it
did
not
suit
her
half
so
well
if
women
will
take
or
give
physic
by
far
the
safest
plan
is
to
send
for
the
doctor
every
time
for
i
have
known
ladies
who
both
gave
and
took
physic
who
would
not
take
the
pains
to
learn
the
names
of
the
commonest
medicines
and
confounded
colocynth
with
colchicum
this
playing
with
sharp
edged
tools
with
a
vengeance
there
are
excellent
women
who
will
write
to
london
to
their
physician
that
there
is
much
sickness
in
their
neighbourhood
in
the
country
and
ask
for
some
prescription
from
him
which
they
used
to
like
themselves
and
then
give
it
to
all
their
friends
and
to
all
their
poorer
neighbours
who
will
take
it
now
instead
of
giving
medicine
of
which
you
can
not
possibly
know
the
exact
and
proper
application
nor
all
its
consequences
would
it
not
be
better
if
you
were
to
persuade
and
help
your
poorer
neighbours
to
remove
the
from
before
the
door
to
put
in
a
window
which
opens
or
an
arnott
ventilator
or
to
cleanse
and
the
cottages
of
these
things
the
benefits
are
sure
the
benefits
of
the
inexperienced
administration
of
medicines
are
by
no
means
so
sure
homoeopathy
has
introduced
one
essential
amelioration
in
the
practice
of
physic
by
amateur
females
for
its
rules
are
excellent
its
physicking
comparatively
harmless
the
globule
is
the
one
grain
of
folly
which
appears
to
be
necessary
to
make
any
good
thing
acceptable
let
then
women
if
they
will
give
medicine
give
homoeopathic
medicine
it
do
any
harm
an
almost
universal
error
among
women
is
the
supposition
that
everybody
have
the
bowels
opened
once
in
every
hours
or
must
fly
immediately
to
aperients
the
reverse
is
the
conclusion
of
experience
this
is
a
doctor
subject
and
i
will
not
enter
more
into
it
but
will
simply
repeat
do
not
go
on
taking
or
giving
to
your
children
your
abominable
courses
of
aperients
