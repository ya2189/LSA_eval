every
step
in
canning
the
method
by
grace
viall
gray
formerly
associate
professor
of
home
economics
iowa
state
college
preface
it
was
six
years
ago
that
i
first
heard
of
the
one
period
method
of
canning
a
little
circular
was
put
in
my
hand
one
day
at
a
federated
club
meeting
announcing
the
fact
that
in
a
few
weeks
there
would
be
a
demonstration
about
fifty
miles
away
immediately
i
announced
that
i
was
going
to
the
demonstrations
so
leaving
my
small
daughter
with
my
mother
i
went
to
the
normal
school
at
dekalb
illinois
and
heard
and
saw
for
the
first
time
canning
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
those
three
days
were
so
crowded
full
of
interest
and
new
messages
on
the
gospel
of
canning
that
i
felt
amply
repaid
for
going
fifty
miles
as
a
result
of
that
trip
the
first
story
ever
published
on
canning
appeared
in
country
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
writing
it
so
enthused
was
i
over
this
new
efficient
and
easy
way
to
can
not
only
fruits
but
hard
vegetables
such
as
peas
corn
and
beans
that
i
wanted
to
carry
the
good
news
into
the
kitchen
of
other
busy
housewives
and
mothers
my
mother
had
insisted
that
i
take
with
me
my
younger
sister
just
from
college
but
with
no
domestic
science
tendencies
so
much
against
her
wishes
preferring
rather
to
do
some
settlement
work
my
sister
went
with
me
the
canning
was
so
interesting
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
my
sister
became
enthusiastic
over
one
phase
of
cooking
my
mother
was
so
pleased
at
this
zeal
that
when
she
received
my
sister
letter
written
from
dekalb
saying
mother
i
am
enthused
about
this
canning
and
want
to
can
everything
in
sight
this
summer
she
hastily
washed
all
available
glass
jars
and
tops
and
had
everything
in
readiness
for
young
daughter
return
and
we
canned
we
were
not
content
to
can
alone
but
invited
all
the
neighbors
in
and
taught
them
how
to
can
our
community
canned
more
things
and
more
unusual
things
including
the
hard
vegetables
that
year
than
they
had
ever
attempted
before
do
not
think
for
one
minute
it
was
all
easy
sailing
for
there
were
doubting
thomases
but
it
only
took
time
and
to
convert
even
the
most
skeptical
ones
and
here
i
must
make
a
confession
it
was
much
easier
for
my
sister
unversed
in
any
phase
of
canning
to
master
this
new
method
than
it
was
for
me
with
my
four
years
training
course
and
my
five
years
of
teaching
canning
behind
me
and
this
is
the
reason
she
had
nothing
to
unlearn
she
knew
no
other
method
whereas
i
had
to
unlearn
all
my
previous
methods
the
one
period
method
is
so
entirely
different
from
the
old
hot
pack
or
open
kettle
method
that
to
be
successful
you
must
forget
all
you
ever
knew
and
be
willing
to
be
taught
anew
and
right
here
is
where
many
women
fall
down
they
are
not
willing
to
admit
that
they
know
nothing
about
it
and
so
do
not
get
accurate
information
about
it
they
are
so
afraid
of
appearing
ignorant
this
false
feeling
is
the
greatest
obstacle
in
woman
way
i
still
go
into
small
towns
on
my
lecture
trips
and
women
will
say
oh
that
canning
is
new
to
me
i
have
used
it
for
thirty
years
and
when
i
show
my
surprise
they
further
enlighten
me
with
and
my
mother
used
it
before
me
too
with
a
little
tactful
questioning
i
usually
get
these
answers
of
course
i
do
not
hot
dip
and
cold
dip
i
never
heard
of
that
before
i
pack
the
products
into
the
cold
jars
and
for
all
vegetables
i
use
a
preserving
powder
because
there
is
no
way
on
earth
to
keep
corn
and
peas
and
such
things
unless
you
put
something
into
them
to
keep
them
fruit
will
keep
all
right
then
i
cook
them
in
my
wash
boiler
until
they
are
done
and
when
i
ask
how
do
you
know
when
they
are
done
i
invariably
get
the
answer
oh
i
take
out
a
jar
once
in
a
while
and
try
it
it
seems
like
such
a
hopeless
task
to
change
all
these
methods
of
cooking
but
with
a
great
amount
of
patience
and
much
actual
canning
it
can
usually
be
done
not
always
of
course
for
there
are
some
women
who
seem
to
delight
in
sticking
to
the
old
rather
than
try
the
new
the
present
book
is
therefore
designed
for
all
interested
in
greater
efficiency
in
the
home
including
not
only
students
of
home
economics
but
all
persons
who
have
charge
of
homes
and
are
interested
in
learning
new
efficient
time
and
labor
saving
methods
in
the
preparation
of
this
book
i
have
received
much
help
from
benson
agriculturist
in
charge
of
the
government
boys
and
girls
club
work
and
my
first
instructor
in
canning

also

i
getting
ready
to
can
before
the
world
war
housewives
had
lost
the
good
habit
of
canning
preserving
and
pickling
it
was
easier
to
buy
california
fruits
by
the
case
and
canned
vegetables
by
the
dozen
or
half
dozen
cans
according
to
the
size
of
the
family
there
is
no
doubt
it
was
cheaper
and
decidedly
easier
to
purchase
canned
fruits
vegetables
greens
soups
and
meats
than
to
take
time
and
strength
in
the
very
hottest
season
of
the
year
to
do
our
own
canning
but
what
was
true
then
is
not
true
now
the
war
taught
us
thrift
the
crime
of
wasting
even
a
few
tomatoes
or
berries
has
sunk
into
our
minds
to
stay
forever
scientific
canning
methods
have
been
adopted
by
the
modern
woman
women
who
had
never
canned
in
days
before
the
war
had
to
can
during
war
days
food
was
so
scarce
and
so
high
in
price
that
to
buy
fancy
or
even
plain
canned
products
was
a
severe
strain
on
the
average
housewife
purse
the
american
woman
as
was
to
be
expected
came
quickly
and
eagerly
to
the
front
with
the
solution
and
the
slogan
more
gardens
and
more
canning
and
preserving
at
home
a
great
garden
and
canning
movement
swept
the
whole
country
as
i
have
just
said
women
who
had
never
canned
before
became
vitally
interested
in
putting
up
not
merely
a
few
jars
of
this
and
that
but
jars
upon
jars
of
canned
fruits
vegetables
and
greens
and
so
great
was
their
delight
in
the
finished
products
that
again
and
again
i
heard
them
say
never
again
shall
we
depend
upon
the
grocery
to
supply
us
with
canned
goods
if
these
women
had
been
obliged
to
use
the
same
methods
that
their
grandmothers
used
before
them
they
would
have
canned
just
the
same
because
it
was
their
patriotic
duty
to
do
so
but
they
would
have
canned
without
the
enthusiasm
and
zeal
that
was
so
apparent
during
the
summers
of
and
this
enthusiasm
was
a
result
of
new
canning
methods
methods
unknown
to
our
grandmothers
the
women
of
were
forced
into
a
new
field
and
learned
how
satisfying
and
well
worth
while
the
results
were
it
is
safe
to
guarantee
that
every
recruit
will
become
a
veteran
the
fascination
of
doing
one
own
canning
after
one
has
learned
how
simple
and
economical
it
is
will
be
lasting
no
one
need
fear
that
home
canning
is
going
to
suffer
because
the
war
ended
the
immediate
necessity
for
it
home
canning
has
come
into
its
own
because
of
the
war
and
it
has
come
to
stay
because
of
its
many
merits
there
are
four
methods
of
canning
that
are
employed
by
women
all
over
the
united
states
they
are
the
the
intermittent
the
and
the
methods
drawbacks
of
the
old
methods
the
or
method
is
the
oldest
it
was
largely
used
in
the
days
the
food
is
completely
cooked
in
the
preserving
kettle
and
is
then
packed
into
hot
sterilized
jars
after
which
the
jars
are
sealed
as
the
packing
into
the
jar
is
done
after
the
sterilization
has
been
completed
there
is
always
a
possibility
of
bacteria
and
spores
entering
the
jar
with
the
cooked
food
and
the
air
fruits
can
be
handled
successfully
in
this
way
but
this
method
can
not
be
used
for
vegetables
greens
and
meats
it
is
a
very
laborious
hot
and
hard
way
to
can
modern
housewives
are
discarding
it
more
and
more
every
year
and
are
beginning
to
place
their
trust
in
the
newer
and
far
more
scientific
methods
of
canning
the
intermittent
or
fractional
sterilization
method
is
still
beloved
by
some
people
who
cling
to
the
sure
and
hate
to
venture
into
the
new
vegetables
can
be
handled
by
this
method
as
can
all
fruits
and
meats
it
is
used
rather
extensively
in
the
south
where
they
say
the
conditions
do
not
favor
the
great
objection
to
this
method
of
canning
is
that
it
requires
three
periods
of
sterilization
on
three
different
days
and
three
liftings
of
jars
in
and
out
of
the
sterilizer
what
is
sometimes
called
the
method
of
canning
should
not
be
confused
with
the
method
the
is
often
used
in
connection
with
the
canning
of
rhubarb
green
gooseberries
and
a
comparatively
few
other
sour
berry
fruits
if
the
method
is
used
we
would
suggest
that
the
product
be
thoroughly
washed
placed
in
a
strainer
scalding
water
poured
over
it
and
the
product
then
packed
at
once
in
practically
a
fresh
state
in
the
jars
and
clean
cold
water
applied
until
the
jars
are
filled
if
these
steps
are
taken
carefully
and
quickly
the
method
in
most
cases
will
be
successful
with
such
acid
products
as
i
mentioned
as
the
products
will
have
to
be
cooked
before
they
can
be
used
many
housewives
do
not
consider
it
any
saving
of
time
or
labor
to
follow
this
method
the
method
the
method
of
that
came
into
its
own
during
the
war
is
known
as
the
method
of
canning
it
fought
a
long
fight
to
prove
that
it
was
a
very
efficient
economical
and
satisfactory
process
for
busy
housewives
to
can
everything
that
grows
this
is
the
method
that
i
shall
mostly
refer
to
in
this
book
and
if
i
should
omit
the
phrase
you
will
know
that
i
am
referring
to
it
simply
means
that
the
products
are
packed
cold
in
their
fresh
and
natural
state
in
the
glass
jars
or
containers
to
the
fruits
hot
sirup
is
applied
to
the
vegetables
hot
water
and
a
little
salt
are
added
the
sterilization
is
done
in
the
glass
jars
or
tin
containers
after
they
are
partly
or
entirely
sealed
making
it
practically
impossible
for
bacteria
or
spores
to
enter
after
the
product
has
once
been
carefully
sterilized
or
cooked
in
following
this
method
vegetables
should
first
be
blanched
in
boiling
water
or
live
steam
then
quickly
plunged
into
cold
water
and
the
skins
removed
the
products
are
then
packed
in
containers
and
sterilized
according
to
the
instructions
and
recipes
given
later
when
we
use
the
term
sterilizing
we
simply
mean
cooking
the
product
for
a
certain
period
of
time
after
the
jar
has
been
filled
with
food
it
is
sometimes
called
processing
sterilizing
processing
boiling
and
cooking
are
all
interchangeable
terms
and
mean
one
and
the
same
thing
by
this
or
method
of
canning
all
food
products
including
fruits
vegetables
and
meats
can
be
successfully
sterilized
in
a
single
period
with
but
one
handling
of
the
product
in
and
out
of
the
canner
all
the
flavor
is
retained
the
product
is
not
cooked
to
a
mushy
pulp
and
the
labor
and
time
needed
for
the
canning
are
less
than
in
any
other
method
the
housewife
canning
enemy
mold
is
eliminated
and
all
bacteria
and
bacterial
spores
which
cause
vegetables
and
meat
to
spoil
are
destroyed
expensive
outfits
not
essential
for
this
method
you
can
use
whatever
equipment
you
have
in
the
kitchen
complicated
equipment
is
not
essential
many
of
us
have
purchased
commercial
outfits
for
we
know
we
can
turn
out
more
at
the
end
of
a
day
and
have
found
it
well
worth
while
to
invest
a
few
dollars
in
equipment
that
enabled
us
to
be
more
efficient
but
if
you
are
a
beginner
and
do
not
care
to
put
any
money
in
an
unknown
venture
use
the
available
things
at
hand
just
to
prove
to
yourself
and
others
that
it
can
be
done
every
type
of
glass
jar
manufactured
can
be
used
except
those
which
are
sealed
with
wax
so
dig
into
your
storerooms
attics
and
basements
and
bring
forth
all
your
old
jars
if
a
top
is
in
good
condition
and
will
make
a
perfect
seal
when
adjusted
with
a
good
rubber
you
can
use
that
jar
if
the
tops
can
not
be
restored
to
good
condition
it
is
poor
economy
to
use
them
imperfectly
sealed
jars
are
probably
responsible
for
more
spoiled
canned
goods
than
any
other
cause
good
tops
and
good
rubbers
are
requisites
for
good
canning
for
your
canner
or
sterilizer
you
may
use
a
wash
boiler
or
a
galvanized
bucket
such
as
is
used
for
a
garbage
pail
a
new
one
of
course
either
is
excellent
where
the
family
is
small
and
the
canning
is
accordingly
light
some
use
the
reservoir
of
the
cookstove
while
others
employ
a
large
vat
if
you
should
have
to
buy
the
wash
boiler
or
pail
see
that
it
has
a
cover
and
be
sure
the
pail
does
not
leak
then
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
secure
what
we
call
a
false
bottom
something
that
will
keep
the
jars
of
fruit
from
touching
the
direct
bottom
of
the
boiler
or
pail
this
false
bottom
remember
is
absolutely
necessary
for
without
it
the
jars
will
break
during
the
boiling
for
this
false
bottom
use
a
wire
netting
of
mesh
and
cut
it
to
fit
the
bottom
of
the
sterilizer
whether
boiler
pail
or
bucket
if
you
have
any
netting
and
do
not
care
to
purchase
it
a
wooden
bottom
can
be
made
to
fit
the
sterilizer
or
if
that
is
not
available
put
thin
pieces
of
wood
in
the
bottom
anything
to
keep
the
jars
from
coming
in
direct
contact
with
the
bottom
of
the
sterilizer
if
you
have
only
a
small
quantity
of
berries
or
fruit
to
can
use
a
deep
saucepan
with
a
cover
and
a
few
slats
of
wood
this
rack
is
absolutely
necessary
to
keep
the
contents
of
the
jars
from
becoming
overheated
even
if
they
should
not
break
there
is
a
tendency
for
part
of
the
contents
to
escape
under
the
cover
and
be
lost
do
not
use
hay
old
clothes
newspapers
or
excelsior
for
a
false
bottom
they
are
unsatisfactory
because
they
do
not
allow
proper
circulation
of
water
individual
jar
holders
are
very
convenient
and
are
preferred
by
many
women
to
the
racks
inexpensive
racks
with
handles
are
on
the
market
and
are
worth
what
they
cost
in
saved
nerves
and
unburned
fingers
some
hold
eight
jars
others
hold
twelve
so
it
just
lies
with
you
individual
housekeeper
whether
you
want
a
rack
that
will
hold
all
your
jars
or
a
set
of
individual
holders
that
handles
them
separately
to
return
to
the
subject
of
the
canner
let
me
add
that
no
matter
what
kind
you
use
it
must
be
at
least
three
inches
deeper
than
the
tallest
jar
this
will
give
room
for
the
rack
and
an
extra
inch
or
two
so
that
the
water
will
not
boil
over
besides
the
canners
the
jars
the

a
great
many
people
have
been
led
to
believe
through
advertising
matter
that
it
is
both
safe
and
practical
to
use
canning
compounds
for
the
preserving
of
vegetables
which
have
proved
hard
to
keep
under
the
commonly
known
methods
of
canning
the
first
argument
against
the
use
of
a
canning
compound
is
that
it
is
unnecessary
it
is
possible
to
sterilize
any
fruit
or
vegetable
which
grows
on
tree
vine
shrub
or
in
the
ground
by
this
method
of
canning
without
the
use
of
a
compound
the
second
argument
against
it
is
that
many
of
the
canning
compounds
are
positively
harmful
to
health
some
of
them
contain
as
high
as
per
cent
of
boric
acid
directors
of
county
and
state
fairs
should
exclude
from
entry
all
fruits
and
vegetables
that
have
been
preserved
in
any
canning
compound
perfect
fruit
can
be
produced
without
any
chemical
preservative
the
third
argument
is
that
they
are
expensive
there
are
many
modifications
of
the
original
wash
boiler
and
garbage
pail
cookers
these
are
all
known
as
the
outfits
in
these
outfits
the
products
are
all
cooked
in
boiling
water
there
are
cookers
under
various
names
where
the
product
is
cooked
in
condensed
steam
these
steamers
are
generally
used
for
everyday
cookery
the
outfit
the

and
the
aluminum
pressure
cooker

as

to
sterilize

the
canner
in
simplicity
of
construction
and
manipulation
is
the
cooker
the
temperature
of
the
outfit
is
a
little
higher
than
the
homemade
or
outfit
so
time
is
saved
in
the
sterilizing
the
and
the
pressure
cookers
are
more
complicated
but
more
efficient
some
prefer
the
aluminum
pressure
cooker
because
it
can
be
used
for
everyday
cooking
in
the
home
pressure
cookers
are
expensive
but
they
are
worth
their
price
as
they
are
used
daily
and
not
just
during
the
canning
season
here
are
examples
of

kept
busy
during
the
vacation
months
have
made
some
wonderful
devices
for

would
it
not
be
a
good
plan
to
buy
one
for
the
young
people
of
your

and
give
them
something
definite

worth

you
know
little
brains

must
be
kept
busy

not
usefully
employed
they
are
often
inclined
to
mischief
this
type
of
cooker
furnishes
its
own
heat
so
it
can
be
used
in
the

remember
that
the
higher
the
altitude
the
lower
the
degree
of
heat
required
to
boil
water
given
in
instructions
for
canning
are
usually
based
upon
the
requirements
of
an
altitude
of
feet
above
sea
level
generally
speaking
for
every
increase
in
altitude
it
will
be
well
to
add
twenty
per
cent
to
the
time
required
as
given
in
recipes
or

for
the

chapter
ii
soft
fruits
and
berries
having
decided
on
your
canning
outfit
whether
you
are
going
to
can
in
boiling
water
in
a
condensed
steam
cooker
or
in
steam
under
pressure
having
gathered
together
the
necessary
tools
such
as
spoons
knives
and
a
funnel
having
raided
the
storeroom
and
collected
some
jars
you
are
now
ready
for
the
actual
work
of
canning
it
is
rather
unfortunate
that
strawberries
should
be
one
of
the
very
hardest
products
to
can
with
good
results
the
canning
itself
is
simple
all
berries
are
quickly
and
easily
canned
but
strawberries
always
shrink
are
apt
to
turn
a
little
brown
and
what
distresses
us
most
of
all
they
float
to
the
top
of
the
jar
the
berry
tendency
to
shrink
is
responsible
for
loss
of
color
as
well
as
its
floating
qualities
however
if
you
will
be
exceedingly
careful
to
remove
the
berries
from
the
canner
the
minute
the
clock
says
the
sterilizing
period
is
over
you
will
have
a
fairly
good
product
two
minutes
too
long
will
produce
a
very
dark
shrunken
berry
so
be
careful
of
the
cooking
time
another
thing
that
makes
a
jar
is
to
pack
a
quart
of
berries
all
kinds
of
berries
not
merely
strawberries
into
a
pint
jar
if
you
will
get
that
many
in
you
will
have
a
much
jar
with
very
little
liquid
at
the
bottom
it
does
not
hurt
the
berries
at
all
to
gently
press
down
on
them
with
a
silver
spoon
while
you
are
packing
them
into
the
jar
we
know
we
are
going
to
get
a
quart
of
berries
into
every
pint
jar
so
we
know
just
how
many
quarts
of
berries
we
will
need
to
fill
the
necessary
jars
for
the
next
winter
use
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
test
each
jar
to
see
that
there
are
no
cracks
no
rough
edges
to
cut
the
rubber
and
to
see
whether
the
cover
and
clamp
fit
tightly
if
a
clamp
type
of
jar
is
used
the
bail
that
clamps
down
the
glass
tops
should
go
down
with
a
good
spring
if
it
does
not
remove
the
bail
and
bend
it
into
shape
by
taking
it
in
both
hands
and
pressing
down
in
the
middle
with
both
thumbs
do
not
bend
it
too
hard
for
if
it
goes
down
with
too
much
of
a
snap
it
will
break
the
jar
this
testing
of
the
bails
should
be
done
every
year
the
bails
on
new
jars
are
sometimes
too
tight
in
which
case
remove
the
bail
and
spread
it
out
after
the
bail
has
been
readjusted
test
it
again
the
chances
are
it
will
be
just
right
of
course
all
this
testing
takes
time
but
it
pays
if
you
are
using
some
old
mason
jars
put
a
rubber
on
each
jar
fill
the
jar
with
hot
water
and
then
put
the
cover
on
tight
and
invert
this
is
a
sure
test
for
leakage
never
use
a
mason
cap
twice
unless
the
cover
and
collar
are
separate
so
that
both
can
be
completely
sterilized
fortunately
the
mason
jar
metal
cover
to
which
a
porcelain
cap
is
fastened
is
going
out
of
style
if
you
still
have
some
of
these
old
covers
it
will
be
economy
to
throw
them
away
you
will
be
money
ahead
in
the
end
after
these
tops
have
been
used
once
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
fastening
between
the
porcelain
and
the
metal
so
tight
that
it
is
not
possible
for
the
liquid
to
seep
through
and
cause
the
contents
to
spoil
this
accounts
for
many
failures
when
old
tops
are
used
for
this
reason
never
use
the
covers
the
new
and
safe
mason
jar
covers
consist
of
two
parts
the
metal
collar
and
the
porcelain
cap
they
are
for
sale
at
all
grocery
or
hardware
stores
if
you
are
using
the
jars
which
have
a
composition
attached
to
the
lacquered
tops
carefully
examine
this
rubber
composition
to
see
that
it
is
perfect
this
composition
should
go
entirely
round
the
top
and
should
not
be
cut
or
broken
in
any
place
if
it
is
the
top
must
be
discarded
for
a
perfect
one
of
course
with
this
type
of
jar
no
rubber
rings
are
necessary
as
the
rubber
composition
on
the
lacquered
top
does
the
sealing
it
is
a
wise
plan
to
go
round
the
tops
and
over
the
inside
of
all
new
glass
jars
with
a
heavy
and
dull
knife
to
scrape
off
any
slivers
of
glass
or
bursted
blisters
that
may
be
still
clinging
to
the
jars
those
on
the
tops
cut
through
the
rubber
and
cause
leakage
those
in
the
jars
may
get
into
the
product
i
often
find
these
splinters
particularly
on
new
jars
it
matters
not
what
type
of
jar
you
use
use
what
you
have
at
hand
but
if
you
are
buying
new
jars
consider
the
following
things
before
making
your
selections
no
metal
unless
it
is
enameled
or
lacquered
should
come
in
contact
with
the
food
the
jars
should
be
of
smooth
glass
the
color
of
the
jar
does
not
affect
the
keeping
qualities
of
the
food
the
top
or
part
of
the
top
that
comes
in
contact
with
the
contents
should
be
all
in
one
piece
so
as
not
to
offer
a
place
for
the
accumulation
of
organisms
and
dirt
the
jars
which
have
nearly
straight
sides
and
a
wide
mouth
or
opening
are
easier
to
wash
and
facilitate
better
quicker
and
easier
packing
of
the
product
wash
the
jars
in
soap
and
water
rinse
in
boiling
water
some
people
temper
new
jars
so
they
will
stand
the
shock
of
hot
water
or
hot
sirup
without
breaking
if
you
wish
to
take
this
extra
precaution
put
the
jars
in
a
dishpan
or
kettle
of
cold
water
after
they
have
been
washed
in
soapy
water
bring
the
water
slowly
to
a
boil
and
let
it
boil
fifteen
minutes
after
the
jars
are
ready
test
the
rubber
rings
this
may
seem
a
useless
precaution
but
it
is
a
necessary
one
for
there
is
no
one
detail
in
the
business
of
canning
that
is
more
important
even
in
the
best
boxes
of
rubbers
there
is
occasionally
a
black
sheep
and
one
black
sheep
may
cause
the
loss
of
a
jar
test
each
rubber
before
you
use
it
by
pressing
it
firmly
between
the
thumbs
and
forefingers
stretching
it
very
slightly
if
it
seems
soft
and
spongy
discard
it
all
rubbers
fit
for
canning
should
be
firm
elastic
and
should
endure
a
stretching
pull
without
breaking

many
women
are
laboring
under

some
women
insist
on

and
others
on

given
to
rings
by
adding

its
usefulness
in

there
is
a
little
knack
about
preparing
the

that
few
housewives
know

off
the

of
pulling

sirups
of
course
you
are
wondering
about
the
sirups
for
the
different
fruits
there
is
no
set
rule
for
making
sirup
it
is
not
necessary
to
use
sirup
in
canning
fruits
the
amount
of
sugar
used
in
the
sirup
will
depend
upon
the
individual
taste
in
a
product
there
should
be
enough
sirup
to
improve
its
flavor
but
not
enough
to
make
it
take
the
place
in
the
diet
of
a
sweet
preserve
rather
than
a
fresh
fruit
the
sirups
are
made
either
with
varying
proportions
of
sugar
and
water
or
with
the
same
proportions
boiled
different
lengths
of
time
what
is
known
as
the
california
sirup
is
made
with
three
parts
of
sugar
to
two
parts
of
water
boiled
gently
to
different
concentrations
thin
sirup
for
a
thin
sirup
take
three
cups
of
sugar
and
two
cups
of
water
mix
sugar
and
heat
until
the
sugar
is
dissolved
this
is
used
for
all
sweet
fruits
not
too
delicate
in
texture
and
color
as
apples
cherries
pears

for
fruits
in
which
more

will
be
added
in

the

water
until
it
will
pile
up
over

edge
of
the

this
is
used
for
sour
or
acid
fruits
as
plums
gooseberries
apricots
sour
apples

some
of
the
delicately
colored
fruits
as

until
it
will

in

and
can

from
the

this
is
used
for
preserves
it
is
possible
to
get
more
sometimes
almost
twice
as
much
sirup
into
a
quart
jar
containing
large
fruits
as
apples
and
pears
than
into
a
quart
jar
containing
small
fruits
as
currants
or
blackberries
there
is
a
little
knack
worth
knowing
about
combining
the
sugar
and
water
for
the
sirup
if
the
sugar
is
sifted
into
the
boiling
water
just
as
cereals
are
sifted
into
water
there
will
be
no
scum
formed
this
is

of

hard
fruits
pineapples
the
object
of
canning
citrus
fruits
is
first
to
save
the
surplus
and
second
to
furnish
wholesome
fruits
at
reasonable
cost
to
more
of
our
people
third
to
help
the
producer
to
transform
into
net
profits
almost
every
one
likes
canned
pineapple
but
some
housewives
stopped
canning
this
fruit
because
they
found
that
when
cooked
in
sirup
it
seemed
to
get
tough
and
less
palatable
vegetable
and
fruit
fibers
are
toughened
when
cooked
with
sugar
for
any
length
of
time
so
in
all
cases
where
you
desire
to
keep
the
product
as
nature
grew
it
avoid
this
form
of
cooking
when
the
product
is
put
into
the
jars
with
a
sirup
and
cooked
in
the
jar
you
will
have
a
product
superior
to
the
one
that
is
cooked
over
the
direct
fire
in
the
kettle
with
the
sirup
but
pineapple
slices
or
pieces
are
so
hard
they
can
not
be
put
directly
into
the
jars
as
berries
are
pineapples
must
undergo
a
preliminary
process
to
make
them
palatable
and
soft
this
preliminary
process
is
known
in
canning
as
blanching
after
the
pineapple
has
been
prepared
by
paring
and
removing
the
eyes
it
can
be
left
in
slices
or
cut
into
cubes
in
cutting
hold
the
pineapple
at
the
top
and
use
a
sharp
knife
it
is
then
placed
in
a
wire
basket
or
a
piece
of
cheesecloth
for
the
blanching
blanching
means
to
immerse
the
product
in
boiling
water
for
a
certain
length
of
time
to
reduce
its
bulk
and
soften
it
pineapples
are
blanched
for
five
minutes
we
scald
peaches
and
apricots
which
are
soft
fruits
but
we
blanch
pineapples
apples
and
quinces
the
hard
fruits
scalding
means
to
immerse
the
product
in
boiling
water
for
a
very
short
time
just
long
enough
to
loosen
the
skins
blanching
is
just
a
longer
period
of
scalding
when
you
blanch
pineapples
use
only
enough
water
to
cover
them
this
same
blanching
water
can
be
used
for
making
the
sirup
it
contains
much
of
the
pineapple
flavor
and
there
is
no
reason
for
discarding
it
but
this
is
absolutely
the
only
blanching
water
that
is
ever
used
all
other
blanching
water
particularly
that
in
which
vegetables
are
blanched
is
full
of
objectionable
acids
that
we
want
to
get
rid
of
so
under
no
circumstances
must
it
be
used
but
with
pineapples
the
object
of
blanching
is
primarily
to
soften
the
hard
fiber
so
there
is
no
objection
to
using
the
blanching
water
after
the
pineapple
has
been
in
the
covered
kettle
of
boiling
water
for
five
minutes
it
is
held
under
cold
water
until
cool
enough
to
handle
never
let
it
soak

that
will
impair

apples
here
are
six
ways
in
which
canned
apples
may
be
used
as
a

dish
with
cream
and
sugar
baked
like
fresh
apples
in
apple
salad
often
served
for

pork
the
apples
may
be
fried
in

are
desirable
the

can
be
used
for
pudding
sauces
or
fruit
drinks
apples
are
another
hard
fruit
which
require
blanching
as
it
greatly
improves
their
texture
and
appearance
apples
and
some
other
fruits
such
as
pears
and
quinces
have
a
tendency
to
turn
brown
when
allowed
to
stand
after
they
are
cut
to
prevent
their
discoloring
the
pieces
may
be
dropped
into
mild
salt

summer
apples
are
not
firm
enough
to
keep

when
canned
they
cook
up

lose
flavor
they
may
however
be
canned
to
be
used
in

apples
may
be

able
to

cull
apples
and
thus
have
them
for

is
a

advantage
to

for
it
gets
mushy
an
advantage
of
the
hot
dip
is
that
more
rhubarb
can
be
packed
in
a
jar
after
it
has
been
what
a
bushel
of
fruit
will
yield
a
great
many
women
have
no
conception
of
how
many
jars
of
fruit
they
will
get
from
a
bushel
or
half
bushel
of
produce
it
is
wise
to
have
a
little
knowledge
along
this
line
for
it
aids
in
planning
the
supply
of
canned
goods
as
well
as
at
marketing
time
from
one
bushel
of
the
various
fruits
you
will
get
on
the
average
the
following
products
bushel

quart

windfall
apples
standard
peaches
pears
plums

whole
canning
without
sugar
though
all
instructions
indicate
that
sugar
is
necessary
for
the
canning
of
all
kinds
of
fruits
it
is
not
necessary
for
their
proper
sterilization
and
preservation
any
fruit
may
be
successfully
sterilized
by
simply
adding
boiling
water
instead
of
the
hot
sirup
it
is
a
fact
however
that
most
fruits
canned
in
water
will
not
retain
so
well
their
natural
flavor
texture
and
color
as
fruit
canned
in
sirup
when
the
product
is
to
be
used
for
pies
salads
and
so
on
it
is
not
necessary
to
can
in
sirup
when
fruits
canned
in
water
are
to
be
used
for
sauces
the
products
should
be
sweetened
before
use
in
many
instances
it
requires
more
sugar
to
sweeten
a
sauce
after
canning
than
it
does
when
the
product
is
canned
in
the
hot
sirup
however
during
the
world
war
we
had
a
good
chance
to
test
the
fruits
which
we
canned
without
sugar
when
that
commodity
was
scarce
and
in
fact
impossible
to
get
in
very
large
quantities
we
used
our
fruits
just
as
they
were
and
considered
them
very
good
this
all
goes
to
show
that
we
can
easily
adjust
ourselves
to
prevailing
conditions
in
canning
without
the
sugar
sirup
you
would
follow

chapter
iv
vegetables
it
is
practical
to
can
all
vegetables
even
such
difficult
ones
as
corn
peas
and
beans
by
the
method
of
canning
without
using
any
preservatives
if
you
will
follow
all
directions
instructions
and
the
accurately
vegetable
canning
is
a
little
more
complicated
than
fruit
canning
tomatoes
every
one
likes
canned
tomatoes
in
many
homes
more
tomatoes
are
canned
than
any
other
product
the
housewife
uses
them
for
soups
for
sauces
and
for
seasoning
many
meat
dishes
some
women
say
i
can
preserve
everything
but
tomatoes
they
always
spoil
what
do
i
do
wrong
if
the
following
directions
are
followed
tomatoes
will
not
spoil
tomatoes
really
are
the
easiest
vegetable
to
can
because
the
period
of
sterilization
is
short
and
many
jars
may
be
canned
in
a
day
or
if
one
is
very
busy
a
few
jars
may
be
canned
daily
without
the
expenditure
of
a
great
deal
of
time
the
best
tomatoes
for
canning
are
those
of
moderate
size
smooth
and
uniformly
ripe
when
a
tomato
ripens
unevenly
or
when
it
is
misshapen
it
is
difficult
to
peel
and
the
percentage
of
waste
is
high
tomatoes
should
not
be
picked
when
they
are
green
or
partly
ripe
for
the
flavor
will
not
be
so
good
as
when
they
are
allowed
to
remain
upon
the
vines
until
fully
ripe
care
should
be
taken
however
not
to
allow
them
to
become
overripe
before
canning
in
no
instance
should
a
tomato
with
a
rotten
spot
be
canned
even
though
the
spot
is
cut
out
for
the
occasional
spoiled
jar
resulting
from
this
attempted
saving
will
cost
more
than
the
partly
spoiled
tomatoes
are
worth
if
the
housewife
will
can
only
uniformly
ripe
sound
tomatoes
saving
the
small
uneven
but
sound
fruit
for
tomato
she
will
have
a
much
pack
and
greater
food
value
at
the
close
of
the
season
yellow
tomatoes
may
be
canned
in
the
same
manner
as
are
the
more
common
red
varieties
except
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
remove
the
cores
first
of
all
grade
for
ripeness
size
and
quality
this
is
to
insure
a
product
we
could
of
course
can
different
sizes
and
shades
together
but
uniform
products
are
more
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
will
sterilize
much
more
evenly
if
the
products
are
of
the
same
ripeness
and
quality
the
entire
pack
will
receive
the
proper
degree
of
cooking
wash
the
tomatoes
have
ready
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
put
the
tomatoes
in
a
wire
basket
or
lay
them
on
a
piece
of
cheesecloth
or
a
towel
twist
the
ends
together
to
form
a
sack
and
let
this
down
into
the
kettle
it
is
a
good
plan
to
slip
a
rubber
band
round
the
neck
of
this
sack
to
hold
the
ends
in
place
the
ends
should
be
long
enough
to
stand
up
out
of
the
water
and
so
avoid
danger
of
burning
the
fingers
when
removing
the
product
have
the
water
boiling
hard
lower
the
tomatoes
into
the
boiling
water
this
is
called
scalding
the
tomatoes
we
scald
the
tomatoes
to
loosen
the
skin
if
the
tomatoes
are
very
ripe
one
minute
scalding
will
be
sufficient
the
average
length
of
time
for
tomatoes
just
perfect
for
canning
is
one
and
a
half
minutes
do
not
leave
the
tomatoes
in
the
hot
water
until
the
skins
break
as
this
gives
them
a
fuzzy
appearance
the
scalding
kettle
always
should
be
covered
to
keep
in
all
the
heat
possible
begin
to
time
from
the
minute
the
product
is
immersed
in
the
boiling
water
if
you
wait
until
the
water
comes
back
to
a
boil
you
will
scald
the
product
too
long
and
have
mushy
tomatoes
lift
the
tomatoes
out
of
the
hot
water
and
plunge
them
immediately
into
cold
water
or
hold
them
under
the
faucet
the
makes
them
easier
to
handle
separates
the
skin
from
the
pulp
firms
the
texture
and
coagulates
the
coloring
matter
so
it
stays
near
the
surface
giving
them
a
rich
red
color
then
the
shock
due
to
the
sudden
change
from
hot
to
cold
and
back
to
hot
again
seems
to
help
kill
the
spores
do
not
let
the
product
stand
in
the
the
water
becomes
lukewarm
softens
the
product
and
allows
bacteria
to
develop
take
the
tomato
in
the
left
hand
and
with
a
sharp
knife
cut
out
the
core
be
careful
not
to
cut
into
the
fleshy
portion
or
seed
cells
for
this
will
scatter
the
seeds
and
pulp
through
the
liquid
injuring
the
appearance
of
the
product
cut
out
the
core
before
removing
the
skin
for
the
skin
will
protect
the
pulp
and
there
will
be
less
danger
of
breaking
the
tomato
if
the
tomatoes
are
ripe
and
have
been
scalded
properly
the
skin
can
be
slipped
off
with
the
fingers
the
jars
rubbers
and
tops
should
be
ready
glass
jars
should
be
hot
so
there
will
be
no
danger
of
breakage
in
setting
them
in
the
hot
water
and
so
they
will
not
cool
the
water
in
the
cooker
below
the
boiling
point
pack
the
tomatoes
whole
pressing
and
shaking
them
well
down
together
but
not
using
force
enough
to
crush
them
now
we
come
to
a
point
where
tomatoes
are
different
from
most
vegetables
beans
carrots
peas
and
so
on
have
hot
water
added
to
them
but
as
a
large
part
of
the
tomato
is
water
no
more
is
needed
another
exception
where
no
water
is
needed
is
with
the
greens
family
so
with
tomatoes
we
add
no
water
but
add
one
teaspoonful
of
salt
and
one
teaspoonful
of
sugar
just
for
seasoning
to
every
quart
jar
i
think
that
tomatoes
always
are
improved
by
the
addition
of
a
little
sugar
but
this
is
not
necessary
and
can
be
omitted
as
also
can
be
the
salt
the
salt
in
canning
does
not
act
as
a
preservative
but
as
seasoning
so
if
for
any
reason
you
forget
the
salt
do
not
be
alarmed
your
products
will
keep
perfectly
without
the
salt
the
way
to
seal
the
products
are
in
the
hot
jars
now
the
jars
do
not
need
to
be
full
in
order
to
keep
if
you
were
canning
by
the
method
the
air
in
the
partly
filled
jar
would
not
have
been
sterilized
and
might
contain
the
bacteria
which
cause
the
product
to
ferment
or
mold
but
by
the
cold
pack
the
air
in
the
can
is
sterilized
while
the
product
is
being
sterilized
and
if
the
can
is
closed
immediately
after
cooking
a
single
spoonful
may
be
canned
in
a
jar
and
the
product
will
keep
indefinitely
place
rubber
and
cover
on
jar
fit
the
rubber
use
good
rubbers
and
see
that
they
lie
flat
and
fit
close
up
to
the
can
put
the
covers
in
place
do
not
seal
glass
jars
tight
if
using
jars
screw
each
cover
down
until
it
catches
then
turn
a
quarter
of
a
round
back
or
screw
down
with
the
thumb
and
little
finger
not
using
force
but
stopping
when
the
cover
catches
if
using
jars
put
the
cover
on
and
the
spring
in
place
the
spring
will
give
enough
to
allow
the
steam
to
escape
if
using
jars
with
the
patent
wire
snap
put
the
cover
in
place
the
wire
over
the
top
and
the
clamp
up
the
cover
on
a
glass
jar
must
not
be
tight
while
processing
because
the
air
will
expand
when
heated
and
if
the
cover
is
not
loose
enough
to
allow
the
steam
to
escape
the
pressure
may
blow
the
rubber
out
or
break
the
jar
when
canning
in
tin
we
cap
and
tip
the
cans
at
once
the
tin
will
bulge
out
but
is
strong
enough
to
withstand
the
pressure
and
when
the
contents
cool
the
can
will
come
back
into
shape
the
jars
are
now
ready
for
the
canner
tomatoes
sterilized
under
boiling
water
require
minutes
in

in
eighteen
minutes
in

and
in

if
you

homemade
outfit
or
any
outfit
be
sure
the
water
is

when
the
jars
of
tomatoes
are
lowered
into
the
canner
time
lost
in
bringing
the
contents
to
the
point
of

softens
the
tomatoes
and
results
in
inferior
goods
use
the
ordinary
good
sense
with
which
you
have
been
endowed
in
handling
the
jars
and
you
will
have
no
breakage
at
the
end
of
the
sterilizing
period
remove
the
jars
in
taking
canned
goods
from
boiling
hot
water
care
is
needed
to
see
that
they
are
protected
from
drafts
if
necessary
close
the
windows
and
doors
while
lifting
the
jars
out
for
a
sudden
draft
might
break
them
examine
rubbers
to
see
that
they
are
in
place
sometimes
if
the
covers
are
screwed
down
too
tight
the
pressure
of
the
steam
from
the
inside
causes
the
rubber
to
bulge
out
simply
loosen
the
cover
a
thread
or
two
push
the
rubber
back
into
place
and
then
tighten
in
case
the
rubber
does
not
seem
to
fit
well
or
seems
to
be
a
poor
rubber
it
should
be
replaced
by
a
new
one
and
the
jar
returned
to
the
cooker
for
five
minutes
the
jars
should
be
sealed

and
return
the
jar
to
the
cooker
for
five
minutes
if

ten
minutes
if

these
should

only
lift

so
that
in

or
better
still
tap

product
sterilized
for
the
same
length
of
time
as
for
canned
tomatoes
even
may
be
kept
in
bottles
sealed
with
sterilized
corks
and
dipped
several
times
in
paraffin
how
other
vegetables
are
canned
all
other
vegetables
are
canned
exactly
like
tomatoes
with
two
exceptions
tomatoes
are
scalded
all
other
vegetables
are
blanched
we
scald
tomatoes
to
loosen
the
skins
and
to
start
the
flow
of
the
coloring
matter
which
is
later
arrested
or
coagulated
by
the
blanching
is
scalding
only
for
a
longer
time
scalding
is
never
for
more
than
two
minutes
blanching
covers
from
three
to
thirty
minutes
we
blanch
beans
peas
corn
cabbage
carrots
beets
turnips
and
so
on
for
three
to
ten
minutes
we
blanch
these
vegetables
to
eliminate
any
objectionable
acids
or
bitter
flavors
which
may
be
present
and
thus
improve
the
flavor
to
reduce
the
bulk
so
we
can
pack
closer
to
start
the
flow
of
the
coloring
matter
to
improve
the
texture
of
the
vegetables
by
making
them
more
tender
and
to
improve
the
appearance
by
helping
to
make
clear
the
liquid
in
the
jar
blanching
is
what
makes
for
success
in
the
method
of
canning
blanching
is
important
and
must
be
carefully
and
accurately
done
let
me
repeat
about
blanching
have
the
kettle
of
blanching
water
vigorously
completely
the
product
in
the
boiling
water
cover
the
kettle
and
begin
to
time
the
product
do
not
stand
with
the
cover
in
hand
and
wait
for
the
water
to
come
back
to
the
boil
for
of
course
it
stopped
boiling
for
a
second
when
you
lowered
into
it
the
cold
product
if
you
cover
the
kettle
the
water
will
quickly
reboil
do
not
keep
wondering
if
it
is
boiling
and
take
off
the
cover
to
see
all
these
may
seem
foolish
precautions
but
it
is
necessary
to
follow
directions
accurately
and
remember
all
things
that
are
scalded
or
blanched
must
be
followed
immediately
by
a
cold
plunge
or
the
scalding
or
blanching
is
the
and
this
must
be
followed
by
the
you
may
be
asking
what
is
the
point
of
this
it
is
a
very
logical
question
we
a
product
to
harden
the
pulp
under
the
skin
and
thus
permit
the
removal
of
the
skin
without
injury
to
the
pulp
to
coagulate
the
coloring
matter
and
make
it
harder
to
dissolve
during
the
sterilization
period
and
to
make
it
easier
to
handle
the
products
in
packing
and
to
subject
the

v

after
one
has
learned
how
to
can
fruits
and
vegetables
successfully
the
next
thing
to
attempt
is
the
canning
of
soups
soups
may
be
canned
with
or
without
meat
we
make
one
variety
which
is
a
pure
vegetable
soup
we
use
no
stock
or
meat
and
can
it
in
its
own
juice
or
liquor
thus
using
no
water
when
we
wish
to
use
it
we
dilute
it
three
or
four
times
and
serve
it
as
a
vegetable
soup
or
more
frequently
when
we
have
chicken
bones
or
any
meat
bones
on
hand
we
add
a
can
of
this
concentrated
vegetable
mixture
to
the
bones
and
make
a
delicious
stock
soup
i
will
give
this
recipe
as
i
have
given
it
to

scald
the

by
placing
them
in
a
wire
basket
and
plunging
them
into
boiling
water
for
one
and
a
half
minutes
them
immediately
after
removing
the
core
and

end
of
the

the
skin
slips
right
off
save
all
the

cut
the

put
into
a
large
pail
or
bucket
with
the
juice
blanch
the
cabbage
carrots
turnip
string
beans
okra
and
sweet
red
peppers
five
minutes
of
course
you
blanch
and
each
product
separately
cut
each
vegetable
after
it
is
blanched
and
into
small
cubes
and
add
to
the
tomatoes
spinach
must
be
carefully
washed
to
remove
all
grit
and
sand
all
greens
must
be
washed
through
several
waters
to
cleanse
them
thoroughly
instead
of
blanching
the
spinach
in
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
as
we
do
the
other
vegetables
we
steam
it
by
placing
it
in
a
colander
over
boiling
water
or
in
a
regulation
steamer
with
tightly
fitting
cover
such
as
is
used
for
steaming
suet
puddings
and
brown
bread
if
you
can
with
a
canner
or
a
pressure
cooker
then
steam
the
spinach
there
if
we
boiled
the
spinach
for
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
we
would
lose
a
quantity
of
the
mineral
salts
the
very
thing
we
aim
to
get
into
our
systems
when
we
eat
spinach
dandelion
greens
swiss
chard
and
other
greens
after
the
blanching
or
steaming
comes
the
cold
dip
there
is
something
about
blanching
asparagus
either
for
soups
or
when
canned
alone
that
is
worth
knowing
instead
of
blanching
the
whole
stalk
of
asparagus
for
the
same
length
of
time
we
use
a
little
discretion
giving
the
tougher
harder
ends
a
full
four
blanching
but
allowing
the
tender
tip
ends
only
two
minutes
you
are
possibly
wondering
how
that
is
done
tie
the
asparagus
stalks
in
bunches
and
put
the
bunches
with
all
the
tips
standing
one
way
on
a
piece
of
cheesecloth
tie
the
cloth
or
snap
rubber
bands
round
it
and
then
stand
the
asparagus
in
boiling
water
in
an
upright
position
for
two
minutes
next
lay
the
asparagus
lengthwise
in
the
blanching
water
for
another
two
minutes
and
you
have
accomplished
your
purpose
you
have
given
the
tougher
parts
two
minutes
more
blanching
than
the
tender
parts
use
a
deep
enough
kettle
so
the
asparagus
will
be
completely
covered
when
laid
lengthwise
after
the
blanching
the
asparagus
wash
the
beets
leave
two
inches
of
the
top
and
all
the
tail
on
the
beets
while
blanching
blanch
for
five
minutes
then
next
scrape
off
the
skin
top
and
tail
the
tops
can
be
put
right
into
the
soup
too
any
surplus
tops
can
be
steamed
with
the
spinach
and
can
be
treated
similarly

of
course
you
are
interested
in
the
cost
of
this
soup
most
of
the
ingredients
came
right
from
our
garden
we
had
to
buy
the
okra
and
the
red
peppers
but
i
figured
everything
just
as
if
i
had
to
buy
it
from
the
market
and
on
this
basis
the
cost
of
our
soup
would
have
been
only
seven
and
a
half
cents

can
we
canned
it
in
tin
using
size

is

tomato
acid
checks
bacteria
some
women
who
have
canned
soup
tell
me
it
spoiled
or
tasted
sourish
and
smelled
sourish
too
this
is
what
we
call
flat
sour
it
may
happen
to
any
vegetable
you
can
as
well
as
to
the
soups
flat
sour
affects
peas
beans
asparagus
and
corn
more
than
other
vegetables
if
the
vegetables
have
been
picked
for
some
time
and
the
bacteria
have
had
a
chance
to
work
and
you
are
not
exceedingly
careful
about
your
canning
you
may
develop
flat
sour
in
the
soup
if
you
let
one
little
spore
of
this
bacteria
survive
all
is
lost
its
moist
growing
place
is
favorable
to
development
particularly
if
not
much
acid
is
present
one
little
spore
left
in
a
jar
will
multiply
in
twenty
hours
to
some
twenty
millions
of
bacteria
this
twenty
million
can
stand
on
the
point
of
a
needle
so
a
can
could
acquire
quite
a
large
population
in
a
short
time
bacteria
do
not
like
acids
so
it
is
always
a
good
idea
to
have
tomatoes
in
your
soup
mixture
and
get
the
tomatoes
into
the
stone
crock
early
in
the
game
the
tomato
acid
will
safeguard
the
other
vegetables
which
lack
acid
if
you
are
careless
about
the
blanching
and
that
is
not
doing
these
full
time
if
you
work
too
slowly
in
getting
the
products
into
jars
and
then
let
the
full
jars
stand
in
the
warm
atmosphere
you
are
pretty
sure
to
develop
flat
sour
place
each
jar
in
the
canner
as
it
is
packed
the
first
jars
in
will
not
be
affected
by
the
extra
cooking
have
the
water
just
below
the
boiling
point
as
you
put
in
each
jar
when
you
have
the
canner
full
bring
the
water
to
the
boiling
point
as
quickly
as
possible
and
begin
to
count
cooking
or
sterilizing
time
from
the
moment
it
does
boil
some
women
make
the
mistake
at
the
end
of
the
cooking
period
of
letting
the
jars
remain
in
the
boiling
water
standing
on
the
false
bottom
of
the
canner
until
they
are
cool
enough
to
handle
with
no
danger
of
burning
the
hands
this
slow
method
of
cooling
not
only
tends
to
create
flat
sour
but
it
is
apt
to
result
in
jars
and
in
mushy
vegetables
for
this
reason
you
should
have
in
your
equipment
a
lifter
with
which
you
can
lift
out
the
hot
jars
without
the
hands
touching
them
if
you
use
a
rack
with
wire
handles
this
answers
the
same
purpose
this
flat
sour
which
is
not
at
all
dangerous
from
the
standpoint
of
health
must
not
be
confused
with
the
botulinus
bacteria
which
is
an
entirely
different
thing
flat
sour
perfectly
harmless
appears
often
with
inexperienced
canners
botulinus
harmful
appears
rarely
you
need
not
be
at
all
alarmed
about
eating
either
flat
sour
or
botulinus
because
the
odor
from
spoiled
goods
is
so
distasteful
it
really
resembles
rancid
cheese
that
you
would
never
get
a
spoon
of
it
to
your
mouth
if
you
are
debating
whether
this
jar
or
that
jar
of
soup
or
vegetables
is
spoiled
do
not
the
contents
of
the
jar
it
tasting
might
poison
you
if
you
happened
on
the
botulinus
bacteria
which
is
so
rare
it

jellies
jams
preserves
marmalades
fruit
juices
and
sirups
for
jelly
making
select
firm
slightly
underripe
fruit
that
is
fairly
acid
and
contains
a
large
amount
of
pectin
fruit
that
is
just
a
little
underripe
contains
more
pectin
than
the
mature
or
overripe
fruits
pectin
is
the
substance
that
makes
jelly
harden
this
fundamental
quality
does
not
exist
in
all
fruits
such
fruits
as
currants
crab
apples
and
grapes
contain
much
pectin
and
are
therefore
considered
excellent
fruits
the
white
inner
skin
of
grapefruit
is
also
a
prolific
source
of
pectin
but
as
it
has
a
bitter
taste
we
seldom
use
it
for
jellies
though
we
find
it
valuable
in
making
orange
grapefruit
and
other
marmalades
rhubarb
strawberries
and
cherries
all
lack
pectin
but
can
be
made
into
good
jellies
if
we
add
the
white
skins
of
oranges
and
lemons
to
them
while
cooking
so
the
very
first
thing
we
must
know
about
jelly
making
is
whether
or
not
a
fruit
contains
pectin
there
will
be
no
tears
shed
over
jelly
that
will
not
jell
if
all
young
housewives
will
learn
the
simple
test
for
pectin
to
find
out
whether
a
juice
contains
pectin
or
not
is
a
very
easy
matter
take
one
tablespoonful
of
grain
alcohol
to
per
and
add
to
it
one
tablespoonful
of
juice
that
has
been
cooled
the
effect
of
the
alcohol
is
to
bring
together
the
pectin
in
a
mass
if
a
large
quantity
of
pectin
is
present
it
will
appear
in
one
mass
or
clot
which
may
be
gathered
up
on
a
spoon
you
will
notice
i
said
juice
it
is
peculiar
that
this
pectin
frequently
is
not
found
in
the
juices
of
raw
fruits
though
it
is
very
plentiful
in
the
cooked
juices
therefore
the
test
must
be
made
with
cooked
juice
there
is
little
pectin
in
the
juice
of
raw
apples
raw
quince
raw
grapes
and
yet
the
cooked
juices
are
full
of
pectin
this
test
not
only
indicates
the
amount
of
pectin
present
but
it
also
gives
some
idea
of
the
proper
proportions
of
sugar
to
juice
if
or
more
of
the
juice
forms
a
gelatinous
mass
or
clot
this
indicates
that
you
should
use
as
much
sugar
as
juice
if
the
pectin
is
slightly
gelatinous
or
is
less
than
of
the
whole
volume
of
juice
use
less
sugar
if
the
pectin
is
less
than
add
some
form
of
pectin
to
make
the
jelly
or
can
the
juice
for
use
as
a
beverage
for
flavoring
ice
cream
or
some
form
of
cooking
by
employing
this
test
sugar
can
often
be
reduced
and
thus
the
jelly
texture
will
be
fine
less
rubbery
and
the
flavor
will
be
better
after
the
fruit
has
been
selected
and
prepared
as
usual
by
washing
stemming
and
so
forth
it
is
ready
to
be
heated
in
an
kettle
with
juicy
fruits
use
just
enough
water
to
prevent
burning
about
one
cup
of
water
to
every
four
or
five
quarts
of
fruit
the
juicy
fruits
are
currants
raspberries
and
so
forth
with
less
juicy
fruits
as
apples
or
quinces
use
enough
water
to
cover
or
follow
the
rule
half
as
much
water
as
fruit
use
the
cores
skins
and
seeds
these
improve
the
flavor
and
color
of
the
jelly
berries
can
be
mashed
heat
the
fruit
slowly
in
a
covered
kettle
stirring
once
in
a
while
to
obtain
an
even
cooking
when
the
simmering
point
is
reached
crush
the
fruit
with
a
wooden
masher
when
the
fruit
is
tender
or
has
a
transparent
appearance
it
is
ready
to
strain
the
jelly
bag
must
be
of
closely
woven
material
one
with
a
large
mouth
is
advisable
if
cheesecloth
is
used
double
it
and
tie
opposite
corners
together
when
a
very
clear
jelly
is
desired
use
a
flannel
or
felt
bag
for
straining
the
juice
what
drips
into
the
dish
or
pan
is
called
extraction
one
when
this
extraction
one
is
fairly
drained
out
which
takes
about
thirty
minutes
do
not
squeeze
the
pulp
for
a
second
grade
jelly
as
so
many
housewives
do
instead
make
another
juice
extraction
to
do
this
empty
the
contents
or
pulp
in
the
bag
into
the
preserving
kettle
cover
with
water
and
stir
until
thoroughly
mixed
then
cover
bring
slowly
to
a
boil
as
before
and
drain
again
the
juice
that
drips
out
is
called
extraction
two
the
test
can
be
used
here
again
to
find
out
whether
there
is
much
or
little
or
no
pectin
left
if
much
pectin
is
present
you
can
repeat
the
operation
and
get
extraction
three
three
extractions
usually
exhaust
the
pectin
but
sometimes
you
can
get
as
many
as
five
extractions
you
may
say
why
bother
with
extractions
why
not
squeeze
the
juice
and
be
done
with
it
you
will
get
clearer
and
more
glasses
of
jelly
if
you
will
make
the
extractions
than
if
you
squeeze
the
jelly
bag
i
always
make
the
jelly
from
extraction
one
by
itself
but
usually
combine
extraction
two
and
three
the
next
step
in
jelly
making
is
vitally
important
that
is
how
much
sugar
to
use
to
a
given
amount
of
fruit
juice
this
is
where
many
housewives
fall
down
on
jelly
making
they
use
the
same
proportion
of
sugar
to
all
juices
to
make
jelly
that
does
not
crystallize
the
right
proportion
of
sugar
must
be
added
to
the
juice
to
make
jelly
that
is
not
tough
or
unpleasantly
sour
the
right
proportion
of
sugar
and
juice
must
be
used
currants
and
unripe
or
partly
ripened
grapes
are
so
rich
in
pectin
that
they
require
equal
amounts
of
sugar
and
juice
that
is
to
every
cup
of
extracted
currant
and
grape
juice
we
add
one
cup
of
sugar
red
raspberries
and
blackberries
require
of
a
cup
of
sugar
to
every
cup
of
juice
all
fruits
which
require
much
water
in
the
cooking
take
of
a
cup
of
sugar
to
every
cup
of
juice
crab
apples
and
cranberries
are
examples
it
is
harder
to
make
jellies
from
the
fruits
to
which
a
large
amount
of
water
is
added
than
from
the
juicy
fruits
i
am
frequently
asked
when
should
you
add
the
sugar
to
the
fruit
juice
in
jelly
making
do
you
add
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
boiling
in
the
middle
of
the
process
or
at
the
end
and
should
the
sugar
be
hot
when
added
to
the
juice
it
is
better
to
add
the
sugar
in
the
middle
of
the
process
than
at
the
beginning
or
the
end
skim
the
juice
well
before
adding
the
sugar
so
as
to
lose
as
little
sugar
as
possible
if
the
sugar
is
hot
when
added
it
will
not
cool
the
juice
and
thus
the
cooking
time
will
be
shortened
to
heat
the
sugar
put
it
in
a
granite
dish
place
in
the
oven
leaving
the
oven
door
ajar
and
stir
occasionally
be
careful
not
to
scorch
it
after
the
juice
is
put
on
the
jelly
making
should
be
done
as
quickly
as
possible
no
simmering
should
be
allowed
and
no
violent
boiling
a
steady
boiling
for
as
few
minutes
as
possible
will
produce
good
results
currant
blueberry
and
grape
jelly
usually
can
be
made
in
from
eight
to
ten
minutes
the
hot
sugar
is
added
at
the
end
of
four
or
five
minutes
raspberry
blackberry
and
apple
jelly
take
from
twenty
to
thirty
minutes
the
sugar
is
added
at
the
end
of
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
the
jellying
point
is
hard
to
determine
if
you
have
a
cooking
thermometer
or
candy
thermometer
always
use
it
when
making
jelly
it
is
the
one
sure
reliable
test
the
temperature
for
jellies
is
degrees
fahrenheit
if
you
want
a
very
soft
jelly
boil
it
degrees
if
you
want
to
use
it
immediately
then
boil
it
to
degrees
if
you
do
not
have
a
thermometer
the
next
best
test
is
to
pour
the
boiling
sirup
from
the
side
of
a
clean
hot
spoon
held
horizontally
if
the
sirup
is
done
two
drops
will
break
simultaneously
from
the
side
of
the
spoon
another
test
is
to
take
a
little
jelly
on
a
cold
plate
and
draw
a
path
through
it
with
the
point
of
a
spoon
if
the
path
stays
and
the
juice
does
not
run
together
the
jellying
point
has
been
reached
when
the
jellying
point
has
been
reached
remove
the
kettle
from
the
fire
skim
the
jelly
and
pour
immediately
into
hot
sterilized
glasses
which
have
been
set
on
a
cloth
wrung
out
of
hot
water
to
prevent
breaking
fill
the
glasses
not
quite
full
never
attempt
to
make
more
than
six
to
eight
glasses
of
jelly
at
one
time
if
new
at
the
game
make
only
four
because
there
is
danger
of
the
juice
jellying
in
the
kettle
before
it
can
be
removed
when
the
jellies
are
well
set
cover
them
with
not
merely
melted
paraffin
the
paraffin
if
hot
will
kill
any
germs
that
may
fall
on
the
surface
of
the
jelly
then
cover
with
the
clean
tin
or
aluminum
covers
and
store
the
jelly
in
a
dry
cool
place
after
proper
labeling

the
amount
of

are
rubbed
through

cherries
are

are
fully
ripe
they
make

successful
in

but
be
sure
to
test
for

pineapple
is
best
canned

an
underripe
acid
plum
is
best
plums

quince
parings
are
often
used
for
jelly
the
better
part
of
the
fruit
being
used

raspberries
and
other
berries
should
not

rhubarb
is
an
excellent
foundation
for

fruit
it
will
take
the

meat
canned
meat
adds
variety
to
the
diet
in
the
and
makes
a
pleasant
change
from
the
cured
and
smoked
meats
you
put
meat
into
jars
in
the
raw
state
and
extend
the
sterilizing
period
or
you
can
cook
the
meat
partially
or
completely
and
then
sterilize
for
a
shorter
period
of
time
of
course
a
reliable
method
of
canning
meat
must
be
used
such
as
the
process
where
the
sterilizing
is
done
in
the
tin
or
jar
in
either
boiling
water
or
steam
under
pressure
we
usually
recommend
the
partial
cooking
roasting
or
boiling
of
the
meat
before
canning
especially
for
beginners
if
you
are
a
beginner
in
the
business
of
canning
then
by
all
means
cook
the
meat
before
putting
it
in
cans
if
you
have
canned
peas
beans
and
corn
successfully
for
years
then
you
are
ready
for
all
kinds
of
raw
meat
canning
to
save
criticism
of
the
method
of
canning
meat
and
to
guard
against
any
danger
from
eating
poorly
prepared
and
improperly
sterilized
meat
we
do
not
urge
beginners
to
experiment
with
meat
although
the
meat
can
be
safely
canned
by
any
one
whether
new
at
the
canning
game
or
a
veteran
in
it
if
directions
are
carefully
followed
but
it
is
the
big
if
that
we
have
to
watch
many
farmers
and
farmerettes
are
canning
meats
of
all
kinds
all
over
the
country
and
there
is
never
a
can
lost
we
need
more
meat
canning
done
at
home
and
you
can
do
it
if
you
will
practice
cleanliness
in
all
your
work
and
follow
directions
the
fear
of
getting
botulinus
bacteria
from
eating
canned
meat
is
just
a
it
should
be
clearly
understood
that
botulism
is
one
of
the
very
rare
maladies
the
chances
for
getting
it
by
eating
canned
goods
say
the
experts
is
rather
less
than
the
chances
from
dying
of
lockjaw
every
time
you
scratch
your
finger
to
regard
every
can
as
a
source
of
botulism
is
worse
than
regarding
every
dog
as
a
source
of
hydrophobia
moreover
for
the
very
timid
there
is
the
comforting
certainty
that
the
exceedingly
slight
danger
is
completely
eliminated
by
the
canned
food
for
a
short
time
before
eating
it
there
are
always
a
few
cases
of
illness
traceable
to
bad
food
not
only
to
canned
food
but
to
spoiled
meats
fish
bad
milk
oysters
and
a
number
of
things
there
are
also
cases
of
injury
and
death
by
street
accidents
but
we
do
not
for
that
reason
stop
using
the
streets
if
you
put
good
meat
into
the
can
and
do
your
canning
right
then
you
will
have
good
results
never
put
into
a
can
meat
that
is
about
ready
to
spoil
thinking
thereby
to
save
it
if
you
want
to
be
absolutely
sure
even
if
the
jar
of
meat
seems
perfectly
fresh
when
it
is
opened
you
can
the
meat
thus
insuring
yourself
against
any
possibility
of
botulinus
poisoning
so
you
see
there
is
nothing
at
all
alarming
about
that
frightful
sounding
word
botulinus
using
fresh
products
doing
the
canning
properly
and
reheating
before
serving
eliminates
all
danger
for
canning
meat
tin
cans
are
in
most
respects
superior
to
glass
as
they
eliminate
all
danger
of
breakage
preserve
the
meat
just
as
well
as
glass
and
by
excluding
the
light
prevent
any
change
of
color
if
you
use
glass
jars
be
sure
to
get
the
best
brand
of
jar
rubbers
on
the
market
this
is
very
important
if
as
i
have
said
you
are
a
beginner
cook
the
meat
first
by
frying
roasting
broiling
baking
or
stewing
just
as
you
would
prepare
it
for
immediate
use
the
meat
is
usually
seasoned
according
to
taste
and
is
cooked
until
thoroughly
heated
through
before
putting
in
the
cans
do
not
cook
until
tender
as
that
will
be
too
long
with
the
additional
sterilizing
if
too
tender
it
will
fall
apart
and
be
unappetizing
although
perfectly
good
see
that
nothing
is
wasted
in
the
canning
if
you
are
canning
a
young
steer
or
a
calf
you
would
go
about
it
as
follows
select
the
meat
that
you
would
ordinarily
want
slice
the
meat
wanted
for
steak
what
is
not
suited
for
either
of
these
can
be
used
for
stews
or
be
put
through
the
meat
grinder
and
made
into
sausage
meat
formed
into
little
cakes
fried
and
canned
what
meat
is
left
clinging
to
all
bones
will
be
utilized
when
the
bones
are
boiled
for
soup
stock
the
sinews
the
head
and
the
feet
after
being
cleaned
may
be
used
for
soup
stock
also
the
liver
should
be
soaked
in
water
the
coarse
veins
cut
out
and
the
liver
skinned
and
prepared
any
way
that
is
desired
before
canning
it
or
it
may
be
made
into
liver
sausage
the
heart
can
be
used
for
goulash
the
kidneys
should
be
soaked
in
salt
water
split
open
and
the
little
sack
removed
then
they
can
be
either
stewed
or
fried
and
then
canned
the
sweetbreads
may
be
prepared
in
various
ways
and
then
canned
the
brain
is
soaked
in
water
to
remove
the
blood
and
the
membrane
enclosing
it
is
removed
it
can
be
fried
or
prepared
in
any
favorite
way
and
then
canned
the
ox
tail
is
used
for
soup
the
tongue
is
soaked
in
water
scrubbed
cleaned
salted
boiled
skinned
and
packed
in
cans
with
some
soup
stock
added
if
you
do
not
care
to
use
the
head
for
soup
stock
and
if
it
comes
from
a
young
animal
split
it
open
and
soak
in
cold
water
use
a
brush
and
scrub
thoroughly
remove
the
eyes
and
mucous
membrane
of
the
nostrils
and
then
boil
it
after
it
is
boiled
remove
all
meat
and
make
a
mock
turtle
stew
or
ragout
prepare
the
tripe
as
for
table
use
and
then
can
after
the
soup
stock
is
made
and
the
bones
are
cracked
for
a
second
cooking
the
bones
need
not
be
thrown
away
you
can
dry
them
run
them
through
a
bone
crusher
and
either
feed
them
to
the
chickens
or
use
them
for
fertilizer
in
this
way
not
a
particle
of
the
dressed
animal
is
wasted
here
are
a
few

at

when
the

is
high
the
bird
should
not

fed
for
at

hours
before
killing
it
should
be
killed
by
the
approved
method
and
picked

when
the
feathers
have
been
removed
and
the

feathers
drawn
the

this
rapid
cooling
after

is
essential
to
a
good
flavor
in

fish
people
in
some
sections
of
the
country
are
interested
in
canning
mountain
trout
and
others
live
where
there
is
an
abundant
supply
of
either
fish
or
fish
heretofore
we
have
been
wasteful
and
lax
about
the
fish
supply
but
as
we
have
learned
to
can
vegetables
and
meats
so
we
are
going
to
learn
to
can
fish
fish
is
really
canned
the
same
in
every
step
after
preparation
as
peas
and
corn
are
canned
in
order
to
have
a
good
product
fish
must
be
fresh
when
canned
no
time
should
be
lost
in
handling
the
fish
after
being
caught
putrefaction
starts
rapidly
and
the
fish
must
be
handled
promptly
the
sooner
it
is
canned
after
being
taken
from
lake
stream
or
ocean
the
better
never
attempt
to
can
any
fish
that
is
stale
preparation
of
fish
for
canning
as
soon
as
fish
are
caught
it
is
advisable
to
kill
them
with
a
knife
and
allow
the
blood
to
run
out
scale
fish
this
is
easily
done
if
the
fish
is
dipped
in
boiling
water
for
canning
most
varieties
of
fish
need
not
be
skinned
if
the
fish
is
very
large
and
coarse
the
large
back
fin
may
be
cut
out
and
the
backbone
removed
but
with
most
varieties
this
is
unnecessary
cut
off
the
head
and
tail
being
careful
to
leave
no
more
meat
than
necessary
on
the
parts
removed
remove
the
entrails
and
the
dark
membrane
that
in
some
fish
mullets
covers
the
abdominal
cavity
thoroughly
clean
the
inside
the
head
may
be
cleaned
and
used
for
fish
chowder
if
you
wish
to
be
sure
that
all
blood
is
drawn
out
before
canning
place
the
fish
in
a
brine
made
of
one
ounce
of
salt
to
one
quart
of
water
allow
the
fish
to
soak
from
minutes
to
hour
according
to
the
thickness
of
the
fish
never
use
this
brine
but
once
if
the
meat
of
the
fish
is
very
soft
or
loose
it
may
be
hardened
by
soaking
in
a
brine
strong
enough
to
float
an
irish
potato
for
from
minutes
to
an
hour
depending
on
the
thickness
of
the
pieces
and
the
softness
of
the
flesh
canning
the
fish
remove
the
fish
from
the
brine
where
it
has
been
placed
in
order
to
draw
out
all
the
blood
and
to
harden
the
texture
of
the
fish
drain
well
cut
into
can
lengths
place
fish
in
a
piece
of
cheesecloth
or
in
a
wire
basket
and
blanch
in
from
three
to
five
minutes
three
minutes
for
the
soft
flesh
fish
such
as
suckers
crappies
whitefish
fish
with
a
firmer
flesh
as
pike
muskalonge
and
sunfish
require
minutes
blanching
the
blanching
removes
the
strong
fish
flavor
and
cleans
the
outside
of
the
fish
the

plunging
into

softening
of
bones
in
fish
this
can
be
done
satisfactorily
under
pressure
the
bones
of
fish
are
composed
of
large
quantities
of
harmless
lime
bound
by
a
matrix
of
collagen
which
is
insoluble
under
ordinary
conditions
when
subjected
to
a
high
temperature
under
pressure
this
collagen
is
converted
into
gelatin
and
dissolved
leaving
the
bones
soft
and
friable
and
even
edible
bony
fish
such
as
herring
and
shad
which
are
too
small
to
use
otherwise
are
greatly
improved
when
subjected
to
steam
under
pressure
the
bones
in
herring
are
softened
in
minutes
at
a
temperature
of
degrees
shad
in
hour
flounder
hour
other
fish
are
fully
cooked
and
the
bones
softened
in
times
approximately
proportionate
to
the
size
of
the
bones
the
following
table
was
made
after
many
experiments
and
gives
the
time
required
to
soften
the
bones
in
many
common
species
of
fish
the
term
softening
means
the
point
in
cooking
when
the
small
bones
ribs
are
soft
but
when
the
large
vertebrae
are
not
yet
sufficiently
soft
to
be
consumed
along
with
the
meat
in
some
of
the
larger
fishes
where
the
large
bones
could
scarcely
be
eaten
even
if
they
were
softened
it
would
appear
to
be
a
waste
of
time
and
fuel
to
carry
them
to
a
point
of
complete
cooking
and
in
such
cases
it
ought

in

there
are
two
general
methods
of
canning
shrimp
the
dry
pack
and
wet
pack
nearly
all
the
trade
now
calls
for
wet
pack
because
the
other
always
has
a
rather
offensive
odor
and
the
meat
is
never
so
fresh
and
sweet
of
flavor
as
the
wet
pack
canned
shrimp
is
very
pleasing
to
the
taste
and
is
preferred
by
many
to
lobster
for
salads
and
stews
wet
pack
medium
sizes
are
preferable
as
very
large
shrimps
are
apt
to
be
too
tough
and
too
dry
put
the
shrimps
into
a
wire
scalding
basket
and
lower
into
a
boiling
hot
salt
water
solution
made
by
mixing
one
pound
of
salt
to
each
gallon
of
water
allow
the
shrimps
to
remain
in
this
bath
for
about
five
minutes
then
remove
and
drain
thoroughly
peel
and
remove
viscera
entrails
the
boiling
and
the
salt
will
harden
the
meat
and
make
the
peeling
comparatively
easy
pack
into
enameled
tin
cans

it
is
unsafe
to

the
herring
family

are
said
to
be
of
the
same
species
as
the
sardines
of
france
portugal
and
spain
there
are
two
methods
generally
used
in
canning
sardines
first
when
the
fish
are
put
in
a

such
as
mustard

the

then
soaked
for
about
two
hours
in

this
brine
is
made
with
about
lbs
of

to
gallons
of
water
the
brine
is
then
rinsed
off
and
the
fish
are
cooked
either
boiled
or
cooked
by
steam
when
codfish
are
thoroughly
cooked
the
meat
will
drop
off
of
the
bone
in
pieces
and
it
is
very
white
in
color
and
crisp
in
texture
these
pieces
are
then
broken
in
suitable
sizes
and
are
ready
to
place

the
cans
are
filled

full
as
possible
because

easy
methods
of
canning
in
tin
if
the
proper
sanitary
requirements
are
provided
and
instructions
of
the
method
of
canning
are
followed
it
is
entirely
safe
and
practical
to
use
tin
cans
for
all
kinds
of
fruits
vegetables
and
other
food
products
food
poisoning
commonly
called
ptomaine
poisoning
and
the
effects
ascribed
to
salts
of
tin
result
from
improper
handling
and
improper
preparation
of
the
product
before
packing
or
from
allowing
the
product
to
stand
in
the
tin
after
it
has
been
opened
the
raw
food
products
used
for
canning
in
tin
must
be
in
sound
condition
just
as
they
must
be
if
put
into
glass
containers
it
is
true
that
canned
foods
may
be
rendered
unfit
for
use
by
improper
handling
of
the
product
before
packing
and
that
decomposition
may
occur
after
canning
owing
to
insufficient
processing
improper
sealing
or
the
use
of
leaky
containers
this
condition
however
is
no
more
likely
to
be
encountered
in
foods
put
up
in
tin
than
in
products
canned
in
other
types
of
containers
you
run
no
more
danger
of
poison
from
your
own
products
than
from
food
bought
at
the
store
most
canned
foods
if
in
a
spoiled
condition
readily
show
this
condition
by
the
swelling
of
the
can
or
by
odor
or
taste
canned
foods
showing
such
evidences
of
decomposition
should
not
be
used
certain
foods
which
are
high
in
protein
such
as
meats
peas
beans
and
fish
products
may
undergo
decomposition
without
making
this
condition
obvious
to
the
senses
it
is
essential
therefore
that
the
greatest
care
be
taken
to
subject
such
products
to
proper
preparation
and
ample
processing
it
should
be
remembered
that
canned
foods
after
opening
the
containers
should
be
treated
as
perishable
products
and
should
be
handled
with
the
same
precautions
that
are
applied
when
fresh
products
are
being
used
advantages
of
cans
many
housewives
ask
why
can
in
tin
when
we
have
always
used
glass
jars
there
are
many
advantages
in
canning
in
tin
which
we
can
well
consider
there
is
no
breakage
as
in
glass
you
can
handle
the
tin
cans
as
carelessly
as
you
choose
and
you
will
not
hear
a
snap
or
crack
indicating
a
lost
jar
furthermore
tin
cans
are
easier
to
handle
not
only
in
canning
but
in
storing
the
expense
each
year
of
new
tin
covers
or
new
tin
cans
is
no
more
than
the
purchase
of
new
rubbers
and
the
replacement
of
broken
glass
jars
furthermore
one
big
advantage
of
tin
over
glass
is
that
tin
cans
can
be
cooled
quickly
by
plunging
them
into
cold
water
immediately
upon
removal
from
the
canner
and
thus
the
cooking
is
stopped
at
the
proper
moment
the
product
is
consequently
better
in
form
and
flavor
than
when
the
cooking
is
prolonged
as
it
must
be
in
glass
jars
many
women
like
the
large
openings
of
cans
because
they
can
make
better
packs
than
when
using
jars
if
you
do
not
care
to
bother
with
the
soldering
you
can
purchase
a
safe
and
simple
device
that
will
do
the
work
for
you
this
device
is
called
a
sealer
with
a
sealer
no
soldering
is
necessary
even
an
inexperienced
person
by
following
directions
carefully
can
seal
a
can
as
well
as
an
experienced
one
the
sealed
cans
look
exactly
like
those
purchased
at
the
store
two
or
three
cans
a
minute
can
be
sealed
with
this
device
this
is
the
way
to
operate
a
can
sealer
prepare
the
fruits
and
vegetables
as
for
any
canning
following
directions
formerly
given
for
canning
after
the
fruits
or
vegetables
have
been
properly
prepared
blanched
and
if
necessary
place
them
in
sanitary
solderless
cans
put
water
or
sirup
on
according
to
directions
put
the
top
on
the
can
and
place
the
can
in
the
sealer
raise
the
can
into
the
chunk
by
swinging
the
raising
lever
at
the
bottom
of
the
machine
against
the
frame
turn
the
crank
rapidly
at
first
with
the
right
hand
and
at
the
same
time
push
the
lever
very
slowly
with
the
left
hand
until
it
will
go
no
farther
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
steps
in
the
use
of
the
machine
continue
to
give
the
crank
several
turns
after
the
lever
has
gone
as
far
as
it
will
go
this
completes
the
first
operation
or
seam
continue
turning
the
crank
with
the
right
hand
and
with
the
left
hand
pull
the
lever
until
it
will
go
no
farther
in
this
direction
after
this
has
been
done
give
the
crank
several
more
turns
and
the
second
and
final
operation
is
complete
bring
the
lever
back
to
the
middle
position
and
remove
the
can
the
can
is
then
ready
for
sterilization
before
sealing
a
new
lot
of
cans
or
after
changing
for
a
different
size
of
can
one
or
two
of
the
cans
about
to
be
used
should
be
tested
for
leaks
if
this
is
done
and
the
cans
stand
the
test
it
will
be
unnecessary
to
test
the
remaining
cans
of
that
same
lot
the
following
is
a
simple
and
safe
test
put
one
tablespoon
of
water
into
an
empty
can
and
seal
have
on
hand
a
vessel
containing
enough
boiling
water
to
cover
the
can
set
aside
and
as
soon
as
bubbles
disappear
from
the
surface
immerse
the
can
in
the
hot
water
this
heats
the
water
in
the
can
and
creates
a
pressure
within
the
can
keep
the
can
under
the
surface
for
two
minutes
and
if
by
that
time
no
bubbles
rise
from
the
can
the
can
has
been
sealed
adjusting
the
seaming
rolls
if
bubbles
rise
from
the
can
the
seam
is
not
sufficiently
tight
if
this
seam
is
not
sufficiently
tight
the
seaming
roll
needs
adjusting
provided
the
directions
regarding
seaming
rolls
given
below
have
been
observed
to
set
the
rolls
proceed
as
follows
loosen
the
nut
on
the
bottom
of
the
pin
with
a
screw
driver
turn
the
pin
counter
clockwise
that
is
from
right
to
left
turn
very
slightly
and
while
holding
the
pin
with
the
screw
driver
in
the
left
hand
tighten
nut
with
the
right
hand
and
test
as
before
occasionally
it
is
well
to
compare
the
seam
after
the
first
operation
with
the
sample
can
which
is
sent
with
the
machine
if
seaming
rolls
cut
into
the
can
they
are
set
too
close
and
the
pin
should
be
adjusted
in
the
opposite
direction
from
above
after
adjusting
always
test
cans
as
suggested
above
before
canning
the
seaming
rolls
are
set
before
the
machine
leaves
the
factory
and
should
not
require
adjusting
for
some
time
but
i
have
found
that
slight
variations
in
cans
may
make
adjusting
necessary
if
for
any
reason
the
second
seaming
roll
is
brought
into
contact
with
the
can
before
the
first
operation
is
complete
it
may
injure
the
can
seriously
thus
preventing
an
seam
if
the
first
seaming
roll
is
forced
in
too
rapidly
it
may
ruin
the
seam
push
the
lever
gently
and
steadily
while
turning
the
crank
with
the
right
hand
this
rolls
the
seam
gradually
there
is
no
danger
from
bringing
in
the
second
seaming
roll
too
quickly
if
the
first
seaming
roll
has
completed
its
work
there
are
thus
as
you
see
two
kinds
of
tin
cans
used
in
home
canning
the
sanitary
or
can
which
is
used
with
a
sealer
and
the
can
the
latter
consists
of
a
can
and
a
cover
which
carries
a
rim
of
solder
and
is
fastened
on
the
can
by
the
application
of
heat
the
sanitary
can
has
a
cover
a
trifle
larger
than
the
diameter
of
the
can
thus
leaving
the
full
diameter
of
the
can
open
for
filling
that
part
of
the
cover
that
comes
into
contact
with
the
can
is
coated
with
a
compound
or
fitted
with
a
paper
gasket
or
ring
which
makes
a
perfect
seal
when
the
cover
is
crimped
on
the
can
some
mechanical
device
is
necessary
for
sealing
this
can
and
this
is
the
sealer
cans
may
be
had
with
inside
enamel
or
plain
without
any
enamel
the
following
fruits
and
vegetables
should
be
canned
in
cans
all
berry
fruits
cherries
plums
rhubarb
pumpkin
beets
and
squash
all
highly
colored
products
should
be
canned
in
cans
to
prevent
the
bleaching
effect
induced
by
their
action
upon
the
plain
tin
some
prefer
to
can
fish
and
meat
in
the
cans
other
products
not
mentioned
here
may
be
canned
in
plain
cans
since
they
are
less
expensive
than
the
cans
covers
are
lined
in
two
ways
with
the
paper
gasket
and
the
compound
gasket
the
compound
gasket
is
merely
a
preparation
scarcely
visible
applied
to
the
under
side
of
the
cover
and
is
not
easily
damaged
by
handling
the
paper
gasket
is
a
ring
placed
on
the
under
side
of
the
cover
and
must
be
handled
carefully
if
the
paper
gasket
becomes
broken
the
cover
must
be
discarded
to
sterilize
covers
having
the
paper
gasket
place
them
in
the
oven
for
a
few
minutes
but
not
wet
before
sealing
cans
do
not
remove
or
handle
paper
gaskets
when
the
cans
are
removed
from
the
cooker
the
ends
should
be
raised
this
is
caused
by
the
pressure
within
if
they
are
not
raised
at
the
ends
the
cans
should
be
carefully
examined
for
defects
after
the
cans
are
sterilized
they
should
be
cooled
off
in
water
this
will
cause
the
ends
to
collapse
if
they
do
not
collapse
the
reason
is
probably
due
to
overfilling
it
must
be
remembered
that
peas
beans
and
corn
swell
a
certain
amount
after
water
is
placed
in
the
cans
therefore
in
canning
these
vegetables
the
cans
should
be
filled
only
to
within
a
quarter
of
an
inch
of
the
top
if
the
pressure
of
the
air
from
without
will
not
cause
the
end
to
collapse
it
should
be
forced
in
by
hand
the
tinning
outfit
sealers
are
made
to
handle
the
regular
number
or
pint
cans
and
the
number
or
quart
cans
the
sizes
are
interchangeable
so
that
in
a
few
minutes
time
a
number
machine
may
be
changed
into
a
number
machine
with
the
necessary
attachments
so
it
is
economy
to
buy
a
machine
with
these
attachments
as
you
can
then
use
either
pints
or
quarts
as
you
desire
if
you
are
selling
to
boarding
houses
and
hotels
you
also
will
want
and
gallon
cans
if
you
use
these
cans
and
want
the
sealer
you
can
get
it
for
these
sizes
but
you
must
tell
exactly
what
you
want
when
ordering
the
prices
which
i
give
are
prices
and
are
of
course
not
stationary
a
sealer
that
will
seal
the
number
sanitary
tin
cans
costs
a
sealer
for
number
cans
will
cost
the
same
amount
but
the
ideal
arrangement
is
the
combination
machine
which
can
be
used
for
both
the
pints
number
and
the
quarts
number
this
type
of
sealer
costs
a
special

used
for

and
its
price

in

it
is
always
necessary
to
state
whether
you

in
buying

always
ask
for
the

and
give
the
diameter
of
the

opening
for
whole

and
vegetables
cans
with
or
even
larger
openings
are
preferable
since
the
size
of
the
can
opening
varies
and
it
ordinarily
will
not
be
advisable
to
have
more
than
one

rules
for
sterilizing
remember
all
fruits
and
vegetables
are
prepared
for
tin
cans
exactly
as
they
are
for
glass
jars
and
the
period
of
cooking
or
sterilizing
is
the
same
the
following
rules
will
help
to
avoid
difficulties
in
the
operation
of
the
various
canning
outfits
for
outfits
whether
homemade
or
commercial
support
the
cans
off
the
bottom
sufficiently
to
permit
the
circulation
of
water
under
and
round
the
cans
have
the
water
cover
the
tops
of
the
cans
by
at
least
one
inch
the
heat
and
pressure
must
be
equal
on
all
parts
of
the
cans
count
time
as
soon
as
the
water
begins
to
jump
over
the
entire
surface
keep
it
jumping
on
removing
the

throw
them
into
a
sink
with
running
cold
water
or
plunge
them
into
a
pail
of
cold
water
if
the
cans
are
laid
on
their
sides
the
false
bottom
is
not
necessary
for
and
canners
the
following
precautions
should
be
observed
lower
the
inside
crate
until
it
rests
on
the
bottom
of
the
canners
in
the
case
of
the
pressure
cooker
put
the
rack
in
the
bottom
of
the
cooker
have
the
water
come
to
but
not
above
the
platform
tin
cans
can
be
piled
one
above
the
other
when
the
canner
has
been
filled
fasten
the
opposite
clamps
moderately
tight
when
this
has
been
done
tighten
each
clamp
fully
have
the
canner
absolutely
allow
the
pet
cock
to
remain
open
until
live
steam
blows
from
it
close
the
pet
cock
after
the
gauge
registers
the
correct
amount
of
pressure
begin
counting
the
time
maintain
a
uniform
pressure
throughout
the
process
when
the
process
is
completed
allow
the
steam
to
escape
gradually
through
the
pet
cock
you
can
lift
the
pet
cock
slowly
using
a
pencil
or
a
knife
this
can
be
done
only
with
tin
cans
if
glass
jars
are
used
the
canner
must
be
cooled
before
opening
the
pet
cock
blowing
the
steam
from
the
pet
cock
is
likely
to
cause
a
loss
of
liquid
from
the
partly
sealed
glass
jars
throw
the
tin
cans
into
cold
water
if
tin
cans
bulge
at
both
ends
after
they
have
been
completely
cooled
it
indicates
that
they
are
spoiling
and
developing
gas
due
to
bacteria
spores
or
chemical
action
these
may
be
saved
if
opened

intermittent
canning
or
fractional
sterilization
in
some
parts
of
the
united
states
particularly
in
the
south
such
vegetables
as
corn
beans
peas
squash
spinach
pumpkin
are
canned
by
what
is
known
as
the
fractional
sterilization
or
the
three
days
process
southern
canning
experts
have
had
trouble
with
certain
vegetables
such
as
those
named
when
they
canned
these
vegetables
in
the
wash
boiler
by
the
or
one
period
method
they
say
that
the
climatic
conditions
are
so
different
in
the
south
that
what
is
possible
in
the
north
is
not
possible
in
the
south
the
vegetables
are
prepared
blanched
and
packed
as
in
the
method
and
the
filled
cans
or
jars
are
processed
in
the
wash
boiler
or
other
homemade
outfit
a
given
length
of
time
three
successive
days
after
each
day
processing
the
cans
should
be
cooled
quickly
and
set
aside
until
the
next
day
the
method
is
as
follows
process
or
sterilize
glass
jars
for
the
required
number
of
minutes
on
the

tightly
as
you
remove
the

from
the
canner
and
seal
tightly
set
aside
until
the
third
day
when
the
process
should
be
repeated
for
this
canning
a
good
jar
is
good
although
the
mason
jar
type
of
top
will
serve
for
one
year
after
one
year
of
use
it
is
advisable
to
fit
old
mason
jars
and
similar
types
with
new
tops
if
using
the
jars
such
as
the
mason
do
not
disturb
the
seal
at
the
second

is
used
in
the
south
and
many
other

xi
why

brings
letters
to
my

saying
why
did
my

lose

i
saw
all
the
beautiful
dark
sirup
in

canner
instead
of
in

or
what
shall
i
do
my
beets
are
all
white
etc
in
this
chapter
i
am
going
to
try
and
tell
you
a
few
things
you
must
and
must
not
do
a
few
do
and
may
help
you
a
little
in
your
canning
and
food
preserving
i
want
to
say
right
here
that
if
you
have
failures
do
not
blame
the
method
as
we
are
always
so
apt
to
do
experts
have
worked
long
enough
carefully
and
thoroughly
enough
to
convince
themselves
and
others
that
the
method
and
the
intermittent
method
which
methods
are
employed
for
cooking
the
product
in
the
jar
are
sure
safe
reliable
and
efficient
methods
so
if
your
food
spoils
convince
yourself
it
is
not
the
method
but
something
else
spoilage
is
due
to
imperfect
jars
imperfect
rubbers
imperfect
sealing
of
tin
cans
careless
blanching
insufficient
cold
dipping
or
poor
sterilizing
possibly
your
canning
troubles
are
all
due
to
using
a
poor
grade
of
rubber
rings
this
is
poor
economy
rubbers
are
apt
to
give
more
trouble
than
anything
else
to
canners
when
using
glass
jars
many
of
the
rubbers
sold
are
of
a
very
poor
quality
disintegrating
quickly
when
subjected
to
heat
and
strain
my
sister
canning
in
the
hot
climate
of
india
has
more
trouble
with
the
rubber
proposition
than
anything
else
you
want
good
rubbers
are
willing
to
pay
for
them
and
here
is
what
you
should
know
about
rubber
rings
the
method
and
the
intermittent
method
of
home
canning
require
a
rubber
ring
essentially
different
from
that
commonly
used
in
the
old
method
of
home
canning
investigation
shows
that
many
of
the
rings
upon
the
market
are
unsuitable
for
these
newer
methods
being
unable
to
withstand
the
long
periods
of
boiling
required
in
the
canning
of
vegetables
and
meats
practical
canning
tests
have
indicated
that
rubber
rings
for
use
in
this
method
should
meet
the
following
requirements
inside
diameter
the
ring
should
fit
closely
requiring
a
little
stretching
to
get
it
around
the
neck
of
the
jar
for
standard
jars
the
ring
should
have
an
inside
diameter
of
inches
width
of
ring
and
flange
the
width
of
the
ring
or
flange
may
vary
from
of
an
inch
to
twelve
of
an
inch
tests
which
have
been
made
show
that
fewer
cases
of
occur
when
the
flange
is
ten
of
an
inch
thickness
rubber
rings
as
found
on
the
market
may
vary
from
to
of
an
inch
in
thickness
tests
show
that
of
an
inch
in
thickness
is
sufficient
to
take
up
the
unevenness
in
the
jar
and
still
not
so
thick
as
to
make
it
difficult
to
place
the
cap
or
adjust
the
bail
and
require
a
rubber
ring
that
is
tough
does
not
enlarge
perceptibly
when
heated
in
water
or
steam
and
is
not
forced
out
of
position
between
the
top
and
the
jar
by
slight
pressure
within
the
jar
this
we
call
a
rubber
rings
should
be
capable
of
withstanding
four
hours
of
sterilization
in
boiling
water
without
blowing
out
on
partially
sealed
jars
or
one
hour
under
ten
pounds
of
steam
pressure
they
should
be
selected
with
reference
to
proper
inside
diameter
width
of
flange
and
thickness
good
rubber
will
stretch
considerably
and
return
promptly
to
place
without
changing
the
inside
diameter
they
should
also
be
reasonably
firm
and
able
to
stand
without
breakage
color
is
given
to
rings
by
adding
coloring
matter
during
the
manufacturing
process
the
color
of
the
ring
is
no
index
to
its
usefulness
in
home
canning
red
white
black
or
gray
may
be
used
always
use
with
each
year
product
of
canned
goods
an
old
rubber
may
look
like
a
new
one
but
it
has
lost
its
elasticity
and
its
use
may
cause
imperfect
sealing
and
thus
endanger
the
keeping
quality
of
the
food
this
is
always
a
hard
thing
to
impress
upon
thrifty
housekeepers
the
old
rubber
looks
so
good
so
why
not
use
it
but
be
wise
in
this
and
remember
it
is
safe
to
use
old
new
rubbers
are
expensive
but
what
about
the
cost
of
the
product
the
loss
of
your
time
and
fuel
one
jar
lost
due
to
an
old
rubber
is
so
much
food
time
and
fuel
lost
and
do
not
think
yourself
thrifty
to
use
two
old
rubber
rings
instead
of
one
thereby
thinking
to
obtain
a
better
seal
for
you
will
not
two
old
rubbers
are
inferior
in
strength
to
one
new
good
rubber
if
you
use
old
rubbers
and
your
canned
goods
spoil
blame
the
rubbers

the
rubbers
are
the
glass
jars
you
use
there
are
many
kinds
of
fruit
jars
on
the
market
the
question
is
frequently
asked
which
jars
on
the
market
are
the
best
the
only
answer
to
that
is
to
choose
the
jar
which
is
simplest
in
construction
which
will
seal
perfectly
and
wash
easily
which
protects
the
contained
food
against
contact
with
metal
which
has
the
fewest
parts
to
lose
or
misplace
and
which
fits
the
shelves
and
receptacles
planned
to
hold
it
flat
sour
often
causes
annoyance
to
beginners
in
canning
some
vegetables
such
as
corn
peas
beans
and
asparagus
these
canned
foods
may
show
no
signs
of
spoilage
and
yet
when
the
can
is
opened
the
product
may
have
a
sour
taste
and
a
disagreeable
odor
this
is
not
harmful
and
must
not
be
confused
with
botulinus
which
is
harmful
however
the
taste
and
odor
are
so
disagreeable
you
will
have
no
desire
to
eat
canned
goods
this
trouble
can
be
avoided
if
you
will
use
fresh
products
that
is
those
which
have
not
been
allowed
to
wilt
or
stand
around
the
shops
for
several
days
and
will
blanch
and
pack
one
jar
of
product
at
a
time
and
place
each
jar
in
the
canner
as
it
is
packed
the
first
jars
in
will
not
be
affected
by
the
extra
cooking
when
the
canner
is
used
the
jars
or
cans
may
be
placed
in
the
retort
and
the
cover
placed
into
position
but
not
clamped
down
until
the
retort
is
filled
troubles
with
corn
corn
seems
to
give
the
most
trouble
but
with
a
little
care
and
study
this
product
may
be
canned
as
easily
as
any
other
grown
in
the
garden
a
little
experience
in
selecting
the
ears
and
ability
to
recognize
corn
that
is
just
between
the
milk
and
dough
stage
is
important
blanch
not
longer
than
five
minutes
a
plunge
in
cold
water
is
sufficient
cut
the
corn
from
the
cob
with
a
sharp
knife
and
pack
at
once
in
sterilized
jars
best
results
can
be
accomplished
when
two
people
cut
and
one
person
fills
if
it
is
necessary
for
one
person
to
work
alone
cut
off
sufficient
corn
to
fill
one
jar
pour
on
water
add
salt
place
rubber
and
cap
in
position
and
put
the
jar
at
once
in
the
canner
a
little
overcooking
does
not
injure
the
quality
of
canned
corn
corn
should
not
be
tightly
packed
in
the
jar
it
expands
a
little
in
processing
and
for
this
reason
each
jar
should
be
filled
scant
full
corn
that
has
a
cheesy
appearance
after
canning
had
reached
the
dough
stage
before
being
packed
corn
should
never
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
cold
dip
and
large
quantities
should
not
be
dipped
at
one
time
unless
sufficient
help
is
available
to
handle
the
product
quickly
some
to
be
absolutely
sure
when
canning
corn
cook
it
for
ten
minutes
in
hot
water
before
packing
into
jars
leave
fully
one
inch
of
space
at
the
top
when
packing
corn
but
enough
water
may
be
poured
into
the
jar
to
fill
the
can
or
jar
for
when
the
corn
swells
the
water
will
be
absorbed
corn
turning
dark
a
dark
color
in
canned
corn
is
due
to
some
of
the
following
causes
using
water
that
contains
too
much
iron
using
corn
that
has
reached
the
dough
stage
blanching
for
too
long
a
period
five
minutes
is
sufficient
for
corn
or
soaked
corn
when
canned
corn
becomes
or
soaked
it
is
due
to
such
causes
as
the
following
allowing
the
product
to
stand
in
the
cold
water
too
long
after
the
hot
dip
allowing
the
jars
to
stand
after
they
have
been
packed
and
filled
with
boiling
water
the
jars
should
be
immediately
placed
in
the
sterilizer
after
being
packed
allowing
ears
of
corn
to
stand
in
cold
water
after
opening
heating
corn
in
warm
water
over
a
slow
fire
beets
their
loss
of
color
the
loss
of
color
in
canned
beets
is
due
to
faulty
methods
of
preparation
before
packing
them
into
the
jars
to
secure
good
results
or
inches
of
the
top
and
all
of
the
tail
should
be
left
on
while
blanching
beets
should
be
blanched
for
five
minutes
and
the
skin
should
be
scraped
but
not
peeled
beets
should
be
packed
whole
if
possible
small
beets
that
run
forty
to
a
quart
are
less
likely
to
fade
and
are
the
most
suitable
size
for
packs
the
older
the
beets
the
more
chance
there
is
for
loss
of
color
beets
will
show
a
slight
loss
of
color
when
removed
from
the
canner
but
will
brighten
up
in
a
few
days
cloudy
peas
the
condition
of
peas
known
as
cloudy
is
due
to
such
causes
as
the
following
cracking
the
skin
of
the
pea
blanching
for
too
long
a
period
use
of
water
which
is
too
hard
or
has
too
much
mineral
content
shrinkage
of
product
during
canning
shrinkage
may
be
due
to
one
or
more
of
the
following
improper
blanching
and
careless
packing
and
using
variety
of
sizes
sterilizing
for
too
long
a
period
lack
of
sizing
whole
products
for
the
container
sometimes
there
is
a
natural
shrinkage
that
can
not
be
prevented
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
vegetables
contain
air
in
their
tissues
and
when
this
air
is
driven
off
by
the
heat
the
boiling
water
in
the
jar
rushes
in
to
fill
its
place
in
consequence
we
have
an
apparent
shrinkage
in
the
amount
of
water
so
be
careful
to
do
the
blanching
as
correctly
as
possible
to
drive
out
the
air
however
the
product
will
keep
just
as
well
in
a
jar
half
full
of
water
as
if
entirely
covered
with
liquid
the
contents
of
the
jar
whether
food
or
air
are
sterile
shrinkage
of
greens
shrinkage
of
greens
or
pot
herbs
during
the
canning
process
is
usually
due
to
insufficient
blanching
the
proper
way
to
blanch
all
greens
or
pot
herbs
is
in
a
steamer
or
in
a
vessel
improvised
to
do
the
blanching
in
live
steam
above
the
water
line
if
this
is
not
done
much
of
the
mineral
salts
and
volatile
oil
contents
will
be
extracted
by
the
water
and
lost
loss
of
liquid
during
canning
a
loss
of
liquid
in
canning
with
a
outfit
may
be
caused
by
one
or
more
of
the
following
not
having
the
water
in
the
sterilizing
vat
cover
the
tops
of
the
jars
by
at
least
one
inch
not
providing
a
suitable
platform
to
hold
the
jars
off
the
bottom
of
the
sterilizing
vat
permitting
circulation
of
water
under
as
well
as
around
the
jars
not
having
the
wire
bail
that
goes
over
the
glass

by
opening

cock
slowly
at

does
not
register
pressure
until
about
one
pound
of
pressure
has
formed
hence
opening
the
pet
cock
before
the
pointer
is
at
zero
means
that
from
one
to
two
pounds
of
pressure
is
being
relieved
and
this
will
draw
the
juices
the
same
as
allowing
the
boiler
to
stand
and
a
vacuum
to
form
allowing
the
pressure
to
fluctuate
during
the
time
of
sterilizing
such
as
running
the
pressure
up
to
fifteen
back
to
seven
or
eight
and
then
up
again

should
be
left
up
as
stated
there
may

this
would
allow

you
can
test
this
by

the
turning

color
usually
indicates
that
the
water
contains
too
high
a
percentage
of

water

purposes
should
be
pure

as
possible
if

and
have
difficulty
with
the
water
available
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
have

for
you
to
secure
the
advice
of
some
one
at

of
agriculture
too
much
salt
in
canned
goods
injurious
to
quality
most
vegetables
as
well
as
meats
are
injured
in
quality
by
an
excessive
use
of
salt
for
seasoning
in
the
canning
process
a
little
salt
is
very
palatable
and
its
use
should
be
encouraged
but
it
is
better
to
add
no
salt
in
canning
than
to
use
too
much
as
it
can
be
added
to
suit
the
taste
when
served
altitude
and
its
effect
on
canning
remember
that
practically
all
instructions
on
home
canning
are
based
upon
a
time
schedule
for
sterilization
from
sea
level
to
an
altitude
of
feet
above
sea
level
when
canning
at
an
altitude
of
more
than
feet
above
sea
level
it
will
be
necessary
to
use
your
judgment
in
the
increase
of
time
for
sterilizing
on
the
basis
of
per
cent
for
each
feet
blanching
means
not

in
different
directions
for

we
often
find

mentioned
when

water
should
be
at
a
when
vegetables
are
blanched
berries
and
soft
fruits
are
not
usually
blanched
though
some
are
scalded
to
loosen
the
skin
berries
or
fruit
rising
to
the
top
some
women
are
disturbed
because
berries
and
fruits
have
a
tendency
to
always
rise
to
the
top
of
the
jar
leaving
a
sirup
space
in
the
bottom
to
prevent
this
you
can
scald
all
berries
and
fruits
which
are
not
ordinarily
scalded
for
one
minute
and
then
them
they
will
be
softened
some
but
remain
firm
and
can
be
packed
very
closely
in
a
jar
they
can
be
packed
so
closely
that
only
a
little
sirup
can
be
added
when
a
jar
thus
packed
comes
from
the
sterilizer
the
berries
or
fruit
are
not
floating
as
they
would
be
if
they
were
not
scalded
another
method
employed
to
prevent
berries
from
floating
is
to
put
the
hot
sterilized
jar
on
its
side
while
cooling
and
to
roll
it
frequently
during
the
cooling
period
the
berries
are
then
evenly
distributed
through
the
sirup
in
canning
mushrooms
in

always
use

do
not

and
remove
the
mushrooms
immediately
after

other
similar
products
always
soak
the

troubles
with
tin

any
leaks
in
a
tin
can
immerse
it
in

and
if
there
is
any
bubbling
from
the
can
you
may
rest
assured
it
needs
resealing
swells
in
tin
cans
are
caused
by
insufficient
sterilization
the
action
of
bacteria
causes
gas
to
form
in
the
can
and
as
a
result
there
is
a
bulging
at
either
end
if
left
alone
long
enough
the
cans
will
explode
watch
carefully
all
bulging
cans
and
use
them
first
sometimes
a
slight
bulge
occurs
when
a
can
has
been
filled
too
full
if
you
have
trouble
sealing
tin
cans
the
chances
are
that
the
can
is
too
full
see
that
no
particle
of
food
touches
the
top
or
when
soldering
if
you
employ
that
method
of
sealing
small
pin
holes
will
be
blown
in
the
seal
by
escaping
steam
which
is
generated
by
the
hot
sealer
coming
in
contact
with
the
cold
food
another
cause
of
sealing
trouble
lies
sometimes
in
a
poorly
heated
capping
steel
or
because
it
is
not
kept
brightly
tinned
to
make
a
proper
seal
the
steel
must
be
kept
bright
hot
and
clean
also
be
sure
you
buy
good
solder
as
there
are
inferior
grades
that
are
too
poor
to
flow
when
properly
heated
frozen
products
watch
all
jars
and
cans
that
have
been
subjected
to
a
freeze
if
the
cans
or
jars
do
not
burst
the
only
harm
done
is
a
slight
softening
of
the
food
tissues
in
glass
jars
after
freezing
there
is
sometimes
a
small
crack
left
which
will
admit
air
and
consequently
bacteria
sometimes
cans
and
jars
tip
over
in
the
wash
boiler
during
sterilizing
this
is
caused
by
using
a
which
is
too
low
or
because
it
is
not
well
perforated
or
it
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
the
jar
was
not
well
packed
and
so
may
be
too
light

weight
chapter

getting
ready
to
dry
for
various
reasons
women
have
not
taken
so
kindly
to
drying
fruits
and
vegetables
as
they
have
to
canning
these
foods
one
woman
said
to
me
i
like
the
canning
because
i
can
come
to
a
demonstration
and
see
the
whole
process
carried
through
from
start
to
finish
the
drying
of
strawberries
can
not
be
completed
in
sixteen
minutes
as
the
canning
is
and
another
woman
said
what
i
do
not
like
about
drying
is
having
the
stuff
standing
round
the
house
somewhere
for
so
many
hours
i
like
to
get
things
in
the
jars
and
out
of
sight
these
two
objections
seem
to
be
expressed
more
than
any
other
and
in
addition
there
is
a
third
objection
to
drying
i
want
my
prepared
food
ready
to
use
on
a
minute
notice
i
can
quickly
open
a
can
of
my
fruit
and
vegetables
and
there
it
is
ready
with
my
dried
things
i
have
to
allow
time
for
soaking
and
cooking
this
we
will
have
to
admit
is
true
but
what
weight
have
these
three
arguments
against
the
many
advantages
of
drying
when
we
study
the
history
of
food
preservation
we
find
that
drying
was
practiced
before
canning
pickling
or
preserving
i
know
my
grandmother
successfully
dried
quantities
of
things
vegetable
and
fruit
drying
have
been
little
practiced
for
a
generation
or
more
though
there
have
been
some
thrifty
housekeepers
who
have
clung
to
their
dried
corn
peas
beans
and
apples
a
friend
of
mine
says
why
dried
corn
has
a
much
better
sweeter
taste
than
your
canned
stuff
i
would
rather
have
one
little
dish
of
my
delicious
dried
corn
than
two
big
dishes
of
your
canned
corn
drying
i
think
we
will
all
admit
does
not
and
can
not
take
the
place
of
canning
fruits
and
vegetables
in
glass
or
tin
drying
and
canning
are
twin
sisters
and
always
go
hand
in
hand
the
ideal
arrangement
for
all
homes
whether
on
the
farm
in
the
village
in
the
town
or
in
the
city
is
to
have
an
ample
supply
of
canned
food
for
emergencies
and
quick
service
and
an
equally
ample
supply
of
dried
foods
when
meals
are
planned
beforehand
and
there
is
time
enough
for
the
soaking
and
cooking
of
the
dried
foods
the
advantages
of
drying
when
we
come
right
down
to
facts
drying
has
many
advantages
over
canning
the
process
is
very
simple
as
you
will
see
the
cost
is
slight
in
almost
every
home
the
necessary
equipment
in
its
simplest
form
is
already
at
hand
there
is
no
expense
for
glass
jars
or
tin
cans
and
with
ordinary
care
there
is
no
loss
of
products
as
there
may
be
in
handling
glass
jars
or
from
spoilage
the
actual
work
requires
less
time
and
less
skill
than
canning
and
the
dried
products
when
properly
prepared
are
just
as
good
as
the
canned
ones
some
say
better
one
special
thing
in
favor
of
drying
is
the
little
storage
space
needed
you
can
often
reduce
pounds
of
fresh
product
to
ten
pounds
by
drying
without
any
loss
of
food
value
and
with
little
loss
of
flavor
dried
products
can
be
moved
more
conveniently
than
glass
jars
or
tin
cans
for
they
are
usually
reduced
to
from
to
of
the
original
bulk
another
valuable
thing
about
drying
is
that
the
little
odds
and
ends
one
would
scarcely
bother
to
can
may
be
dried
in
the
oven
as
you
go
about
your
housework
i
have
often
been
asked
the
difference
between
the
meaning
of
the
terms
evaporated
dried
desiccated
and
dehydrated
these
terms
are
used
more
or
less
interchangeably
when
applied
to
foods
from
which
the
moisture
has
been
removed
in
a
general
way
however
evaporated
products
are
those
from
which
the
moisture
has
been
removed
through
the
agency
of
artificial
heat
dried
fruit
is
that
which
has
been
exposed
to
the
heat
of
the
sun
though
not
infrequently
the
term
is
applied
to
products
handled
in
the
evaporator
the
other
terms
are
commonly
applied
to
products
that
have
been
evaporated
by
one
of
the
various
patented
processes
in
which
equipment
of
some
special
design
has
been
used
to
avoid
any
confusion
we
will
use
the
general
term
dried
for
all
products
that
have
enough
of
the
water
removed
to
prevent
bacterial
action
but
which
still
retain
the
maximum
food
value
color
and
flavor
of
the
original
product
and
that
is
what
we
want
to
accomplish
when
we
attempt
to
dry
how
are
we
to
remove
the
water
and
still
retain
food
value
color
and
flavor
there
are
three
principal
methods
by
which
we
can
do
this
first
by
artificial
heat
drying
by
artificial
heat
is
done
in
the
oven
or
on
top
of
a
cookstove
or
range
in
trays
suspended
on
the
stove
or
in
a
specially
constructed
dryer
built
at
home
or
purchased
second
by
the
sun
sun
drying
is
done
either
out
of
doors
in
the
sun
under
glass
in
sun
parlors
or
the
products
are
hung
in
the
attic
where
the
sun
has
free
access
third
satisfactory
drying
may
be
done
by
an
air
blast
from
an
electric
fan
of
course
any
one
of
these
may
be
used
alone
or
two
different
methods
may
be
combined
you
can
start
a
product
on
the
stove
and
finish
it
in
the
sun
or
the
simplest
and
yet
the
most
effective
drying
may
be
done
on
plates
or
dishes
placed
in
the
oven
it
may
be
done
on
the
back
of
the
kitchen
stove
with
these
same
utensils
while
the
oven
is
being
used
for
baking
in
this
way
and
other
bits
of
food
may
be
dried
with
slight
trouble
while
the
stove
is
being
used
and
saved
for
winter
use
this
method
is
especially
effective
for
sweet
corn
a
few
sweet
potatoes
apples
or
peas
or
even
a
single
turnip
may
be
dried
and
saved
to
keep
the
heat
from
being
too
great
when
drying
in
the
oven
leave
the
oven
door
partly
open
for
oven
use
a
simple
tray
may
be
made
of
screen
of
convenient
size
with
the
edges
bent
up
for
an
inch
or
two
on
each
side
at
each
corner
this
tray
should
have
a
leg
an
inch
or
two
in
length
to
hold
it
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
oven
and
permit
circulation
of
air
round
the
product
oven
drying
in
a
gas
range
is
an
effective
method
if
the
temperature
is
kept
even
an
oven
thermometer
is
a
great
convenience
otherwise
the
temperature
will
have
to
be
carefully
watched
and
the
burners
turned
as
low
as
possible
it
is
economy
in
the
end
to
purchase
an
oven
thermometer
for
then
you
can
have
the
temperature
just
right
it
is
best
to
start
the
temperature
at
degrees
fahrenheit
and
dry
at
degrees
never
go
over
degrees
if
you
wish
to
dry
in
the
oven
over
the
kerosene
stove
place
soapstones
over
each
burner
to
prevent
the
heat
from
becoming
too
intense
turn
the
burners
very
low
until
the
stones
are
thoroughly
heated
you
can
turn
off
the
burners
completely
after
the
desired
temperature
is
reached
and
it
will
be
maintained
from
the
heat
of
the
stones
for
five
or
six
hours
if
more
time
than
that
is
required
for
the
drying
it
may
be
necessary
to
light
the
burners
again
before
the
end
of
the
process
the
products
should
be
turned
constantly
so
that
they
may
dry
evenly
when
using
any
oven
for
drying
you
can
cover
the
oven
racks
with
cheesecloth
and
spread
the
products
on
them
always
have
the
racks
two
or
three
inches
apart
to
allow
free
circulation
of

is
used
there
must
be
a

it
is
well
to
have
a
ventilating
opening
six
by
two
inches
in
the
top
of
the
dryer
to
discharge
moisture
the
trays
should
be
shifted
during
the
drying
process
to
procure
uniformity
of
drying
several
types
of
stove
dryers
are
on
the
market
one
of
these
has
a
series
of
trays
in
a
framework
forming
a
compartment
this
is
placed
on
top
of
the
stove
another
is
a
shallow
metal
box
which
is
filled
with
water
this
is
really
a
dryer
this
dryer
or
dehydrator
can
be
used
on
either
a
gas
or
coal
range
a
thermometer
is
necessary
in
order
to
maintain
the
right
temperature
the
slices
of
vegetables
or
fruit
are
placed
on
the
tray
with
the
thermometer
and
the
dryer
does
the
work
commercial
dryers
having
their
own
furnaces
may
be
bought
at
prices
ranging
from
to
some
of
these
in
the
smaller
sizes
may
be
bought
without
furnaces
and
used
on
top
of
the
kitchen
stove
the
cost
is
from
upward
sun
drying
has
much
to
recommend
it
there
is
no
expense
for
fuel
no
thermometer
is
needed
and
there
is
no
danger
of
overheating
the
fruits
or
vegetables
for
sun
drying
of
fruits
and
vegetables
the
simplest
way
is
to
spread
the
slices
or
pieces
on
sheets
of
plain
paper
or
lengths
of
muslin
and
expose
them
to
the
sun
muslin
is
to
be
preferred
if
there
is
danger
of
sticking
trays
may
be
used
instead
of
paper
or
muslin
sun
drying
requires
bright
hot
days
and
a
breeze
once
or
twice
a
day
the
product
should
be
turned
or
stirred
and
the
dry
pieces
taken
out
the
drying
product
should
be
covered
with
cheesecloth
tacked
to
a
frame
for
protection
from
dust
and
flying
insects
if
trays
are
rested
on
supports
placed
in
pans
of
water
the
products
will
be
protected
from
crawling
insects
care
must
be
taken
to
provide
protection
from
rain
dew
and
moths
during
rains
and
just
before
sunset
the
products
should
be
taken
indoors
to
make
a
cheap
tray
for
use
in
sun
drying
take
strips
of
wood
of
an
inch
thick
and
two
inches
wide
for
the
sides
and
ends
to
form
the
bottom
laths
should
be
nailed
to
these
strips
with
spaces
of
of
an
inch
between
the
laths
to
permit
air
circulation
a
length
of
four
feet
corresponding
to
the
standard
lengths
of
laths
is
economical
instead
of
the
laths
screen
with
openings
of
or
of
an
inch
may
be
used
in
using
wire
the
size
of
the
tray
should
be
regulated
by
the
width
of

screen
obtainable
the
trays
should
be

the
glass
make
a
light
wooden
frame
of

inches
with
a
length
of
twelve
inches
for
the
front
legs
and
eighteen
inches
for
those
in
the

this
will
cause
the

will
be
a
space
of
about
two
inches
between

is
to
be
fastened
to

legs
by
buttons
when
the
tray
is
in
place
if
you
have
a
sunny
breezy
attic
you
can
hang
your
drying
trays
there
the
use
of
an
electric
fan
is
an
effective
means
of
drying
as
there
is
no
danger
of

the
number
of

drying
by
this
process
may
be
done
in
hours

of
paper
round
the
top
of
the
can
covering
the
joint
between

for
the
purpose
of

should
be
sealed

applying
melted

is
to
pack
just
enough

how
to
dry
fruits
having
decided
to
add
the
accomplishment
of
drying
to
your
other
housewifely
arts
you
have
given
some
thought
and
study
to
the
subject
of
driers
you
now
know
whether
you
prefer
sun
artificial
or
fan
drying
you
have
either
made
or
bought
some
kind
of
a
drier
little
other
equipment
is
needed
a
few
good
paring
knives
some
plates
and
if
possible
some
cutting
or
slicing
device
to
lighten
the
work
of
preparation
are
all
that
are
necessary
a
sharp
kitchen
knife
will
serve
every
purpose
in
slicing
and
cutting
fruits
for
drying
if
no
other
device
is
at
hand
the
thickness
of
all
slices
of
fruit
should
be
from
an
eighth
to
a
quarter
of
an
inch
whether
sliced
or
cut
into
strips
the
pieces
should
be
small
so
as
to
dry
quickly
they
should
not
however
be
so
small
as
to
make
them
hard
to
handle
or
to
keep
them
from
being
used
to
advantage
in
preparing
dishes
for
the
table
such
as
would
be
prepared
from
fresh
products
berries
are
dried
whole
apples
quinces
peaches
and
pears
dry
better
if
cut
into
halves
rings
or
quarters
cleanliness
is
essential
a
knife
blade
that
is
not
bright
and
clean
will
discolor
the
product
on
which
it
is
used
winter
apples
should
be
chosen
for
drying
when
possible
as
sweet
apples
and
early
varieties
are
not
so
well
adapted
to
the
purpose
the
northern
spy
the
baldwin
and
the
ben
davis
give
a
dried
product
most
early
varieties
lack
sufficient
firmness
of
texture
for
the
best
results
on
the
other
hand
some
comparatively
early
kinds
such
as
gravenstein
and
porter
are
considerably
prized
in
some
sections
to
prepare
them
for
drying
apples
are
peeled
cored
trimmed
and
sliced
one
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
be
sure
to
cut
out
all
worm
holes
decayed
spots
and
other
blemishes
defects
are
easily
cut
out
with
an
ordinary
knife
having
a
blade
two
and
a
half
to
three
inches
long
to
prevent
discoloration
as
fast
as
the
fruit
is
prepared
dip
it
into
a
weak
salt
solution
three
level
teaspoonfuls
of
salt
to
one
gallon
of
water
after
all
the
apples
are
prepared
remove
surplus
moisture
and
put
on
trays
drier
or
whatever
device
you
are
using
how
to
regulate
the
heat
start
with
the
temperature
at
degrees
fahrenheit
gradually
raise
it
to
degrees
and
do
the
drying
at
that
temperature
it
is
important
to
know
the
degree
of
heat
in
the
drier
and
this
can
not
be
determined
very
accurately
except
by
using
a
thermometer
inexpensive
oven
thermometers
can
be
bought
or
an
ordinary
thermometer
can
be
suspended
in
the
drier
if
a
thermometer
is
not
used
the
greatest
care
should
be
given
to
the
regulation
of
the
heat
the
temperature
in
the
drier
rises
rather
quickly
and
the
product
may
scorch
unless
close
attention
is
given
to
it
the
reason
sun
drying
is
popularly
believed
to
give
fruits
and
vegetables
a
sweeter
flavor
probably
is
that
in
the
sun
they
never
are
scorched
whereas
in
the
oven
or
over
a
stove
scorching
is
likely
to
happen
unless
one
is
very
careful
an
oven
or
dairy
thermometer
is
a
good
investment
if
you
do
not
have
a
thermometer
test
the
heat
by
the
air
feeling
warm
to
the
hand
the
product
should
never
be
so
hot
that
it
can
not
be
grasped
in
the
hand
in
order
to
prevent
the
fruit
from
burning
where
artificial
heat
is
used
and
to
keep
it
from
sticking
to
the
drier
by
remaining
in
contact
with
it
too
long
stir
the
fruit
occasionally
to
insure
the
most
uniform
drying
in
sun
drying
the
fruit
also
should
be
stirred
occasionally
remember
that
if
trays
with
metal
bottoms
are
used
for
drying
they
should
be
covered
with
cheesecloth
to
prevent
acid
action
oven
racks
may
be
covered
with
either
cheesecloth
or
heavy
wrapping
paper
the
interval
between
stirring
varies
with
the
type
of
drier
used
with
the
condition
of
the
fruit
and
with
the
degree
of
heat
maintained
make
the
first
stirring
within
two
hours
after
the
drying
is
begun
after
that
examine
the
product
from
time
to
time
and
stir
often
enough
to
prevent
scorching
or
sticking
and
to
insure
uniform
drying
use
a
wooden
paddle
for
stirring
where
several
trays
or
racks
are
placed
one
above
the
other
it
is
necessary
to
shift
the
trays
from
time
to
time
so
the
upper
tray
goes
to
the
bottom
and
the
bottom
tray
to
the
top
the
time
necessary
for
drying
fruit
depends
upon
several
factors
the
type
and
construction
of
the
drier
the
depth
to
which
the
fruit
is
spread
the
method
of
preparing
whether
sliced
quartered
or
whole
the
temperature
maintained
and
weather
conditions
whether
bright
and
sunny
or
cloudy
and
damp
if
the
atmosphere
is
heavy
and
damp
the
drying
is
retarded
under
some
conditions
it
is
hardly
possible
thoroughly
to
dry
fruit
there
is
possibly
no
step
in
the
entire
drying
process
that
requires
judgment
than
the
matter
of
knowing
when
the
fruit
is
sufficiently
dried
a
little
experience
will
soon
teach
this
the
fruit
should
be
so
dry
that
when
a
handful
of
slices
is
pressed
together
firmly
into
a
ball
the
slices
will
be
springy
enough
to
separate
at
once
upon
being
released
from
the
hand
no
fruit
should
have
any
visible
moisture
on
the
surface
as
the
dried
apples
pears
peaches
and
apricots
are
handled
they
should
feel
soft
and
velvety
to
the
touch
and
have
a
pliable
texture
you
do
not
want
fruit
so
dry
that
it
will
rattle
if
fruits
are
brittle
you
have
dried
them
too
much
after
the
apples
and
all
other
fruits
are
dried
they
must
go
through
another
process
called
conditioning
the
best
way
to
condition
fruits
is
to
place
them
in
boxes
or
cans
and
pour
them
from
one
container
into
another
once
a
day
for
three
or
four
successive
days
by
doing
this
you
mix
the
fruit
thoroughly
and
give
to
the
whole
mass
an
even
degree
of
moisture
pieces
that
are
too
dry
will
absorb
moisture
from
those
that
are
too
moist
you
may
lose
a
whole
bag
or
jar
of
dried
products
if
you
neglect
the
conditioning
for
if
one
moist
piece
goes
into
that
bag
all
is
lost
moisture
breeds
mold
and
mold
means
decay
ask
yourself
these
questions
do
i
ever
lose
any
dried
products
are
my
dried
products
when
soaked
and
cooked
as
near
like
the
original
fruit
as
possible
if
you
lose
products
and
if
your
dried
fruits
are
tasteless
you
had
better
start
the
conditioning
process
for
with
this
one
step
added
to
your
drying
you
need
lose
no
dried
products
and
you
need
not
dry
the
fruits
to
the
brittle
stage
as
you
must
of
necessity
do
when
you
put
them
away
immediately
after
you
have
poured
the
dried
products
back
and
forth
every
day
for
three
or
four
days
as
an
additional
precaution
reheat
the
dried
fruit
to
degrees
just
long
enough
about
thirty
minutes
to
allow
the
heat
to
penetrate
throughout
the
product
two
kinds
of
moths
stand
out
prominently
among
insects
that
attack
dried
fruits
and
vegetables
they
are
much
more
likely
to
get
into
the
fruit
during
the
process
of
drying
than
to
find
their
way
through
boxes
into
the
stored
products
this
applies
particularly
to
drying
in
the
sun
the
moth
is
the
most
destructive
of
these
insects
it
is
about
of
an
inch
long
and
has
a
cloaked
appearance
gray
and
the
rest
the
fig
moth
is
about
the
same
size
but
dark
neutral
gray
a
minute
flattened
beetle
usually
accompanies
these
moths
and
does
considerable
damage
both
of
the
moths
deposit
their
eggs
on
fruit
when
it
is
on
the
drying
racks
usually
at
dusk
or
after
dark
for
these
insects
are
not
fond
of
daylight
it
takes
from
three
to
ten
days
for
the
eggs
to
hatch
into
whitish
or
pinkish
grublike
caterpillars
and
from
five
to
ten
weeks
from
the
laying
of
the
eggs
before
more
moths
appear
to
lay
another
lot
of
eggs
a
number
of
broods
or
generations
are
produced
yearly
so
if
a
few
of
these
moth
eggs
are
stored
away
on
dried
fruits
or
vegetables
hundreds
of
caterpillars
are
produced
and
many
pounds
of
valuable
material
may
be
destroyed
during
the
winter
if
the
products
are
stored
in
a
warm
room
dried
fruits
stored
in
warm
dark
bins
or
in
sacks
offer
especially
favorable
places
for
the
development
of
these
destructive
moths
it
is
evident
that
the
larger
the
package
the
greater
the
chance
of
a
few
eggs
doing
much
damage
small
cartons
or
containers
confine
the
injury
from
these
moths
to
small
quantities
of
material
for
if
the
containers
are
closed
tightly
the
insects
can
not
easily
escape
from
them
and
infest
other
packages
which
may
not
have
been
infested
previously
if
you
are
drying
by
sun
and
the
products
are
not
thoroughly
dry
at
night
finish
the
process
on
the
stove
if
you
desire
to
carry
it
over
to
the
next
day
screen
the
drying
racks
early
in
the
evening
and
fasten
down
the
cheesecloth
with
these
precautions
and
with
proper
storage
no
danger
ordinarily
need
be
feared
from
these
insects
the
additional
precaution
of
heating
the
dried
product
to
degrees
for
thirty
minutes
sterilizes
it
if
already
infested
though
not
necessary
tin
cans
or
glass
jars
make
good
receptacles
for
storage
of
dried
fruits
or
vegetables
pasteboard
boxes
with
tight
covers
stout
paper
bags
and
patented
paraffin
paper
cartons
also
afford
ample
protection
for
dried
products
when
protected
from
insects
and
rodents
the
dried
products
must
be
protected
from
outside
moisture
and
will
keep
best
in
a
cool
dry
place
these
conditions
however
are
difficult
to
obtain
in
the
more
humid
regions
and
there
containers
should
be
used
if
a
small
amount
of
dried
product
is
put
in
each
receptacle
just
enough
for
one
or
two
meals
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
open
a
container
the
contents
of
which
can
not
be
consumed
in
a
short
time
if
a
paper
bag
is
used
the
upper
part
should
be
twisted
into
a
neck
bent
over
and
tied
tightly
with
a
string
a
further
precaution
is
to
place
the
small
bags
in
a
tin
container
with
a
tightly
fitting
cover
such
as
an
ordinary
lard
can
all
bags
should
bear
a
label
pears
and
quinces
usually
are
prepared
and
dried
exactly
as
are
apples
pears
are
attractive
when
cut
lengthwise
into
halves
with
the
stem
and
calyx
removed
but
the
core
left
in
or
they
may
be
quartered
if
sliced
like
apples
the
drying
period
is
shortened
peaches
usually
are
dried
unpeeled
but
they
are
better
if
peeled
before
drying
the
first
step
in
the
preparation
of
peaches
is
to
split
them
open
to
remove
the
pit
to
do
this
cut
completely
round
the
peach
in
the
line
of
the
suture
with
a
sharp
knife
the
cut
must
be
complete
for
tearing
of
the
flesh
will
make
the
finished
product
less
attractive
if
the
fruit
is
to
be
peeled
the
paring
should
be
done
before
it
is
cut
open
to
remove
the
pit
to
facilitate
the
removal
of
the
skin
dip
the
peaches
in
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
for
one
and
a
half
minutes
then
plunge
directly
into
cold
water
after
which
the
skins
can
be
easily
slipped
off
after
the
pit
has
been
removed
lay
on
drier
pit
side
up
the
juice
of
the
fruit
will
collect
in
the
pit
or
cup
and
will
add
to
the
flavor
and
quality
of
the
dried
peaches
the
peaches
can
be
cut
into
smaller
pieces
if
you
wish
to
lessen
the
drying
period
plums
and
apricots
are
not
peeled
but
are
cut
into
halves
the
pits
removed
and
dried
in
the
same
way
as
peaches
small
varieties
of
plums
are
not
suitable
for
drying
when
drying
cherries
always
remove
the
stems
the
pits
may
or
may
not
be
removed
the
best
product
for
later
cooking
or
eating
has
the
pit
removed
though
large
quantities
of
juices
are
lost
in
the
pitting
unless
you
provide
some
way
of
saving
and
utilizing
it
a
prune
is
simply
a
plum
having
certain
qualities
not
possessed
by
all
plums
all
prunes
are
plums
but
not
all
plums
are
prunes
the
final
test
as
to
whether
a
plum
is
a
prune
is
the
ability
to
dry
without
fermenting
with
the
pit
still
remaining
in
the
fruit
if
a
plum
can
not
dry
without
fermentation
unless
the
pit
is
removed
it
is
not
a
prune
prunes
for
drying
like
other
fruits
should
be
fully
ripe
prunes
are
merely
washed
and
then
dried
without
removing
the
pits
the
fruit
is
dry
when
the
skin
is
well
shrunken
the
texture
should
be
firm
but
springy
and
pliable
enough
to
yield
readily
when
pressed
in
the
hand
the
drying
should
not
be
continued
until
the
individual
prunes
rattle
as
they
are
brought
in
contact
with
one
another
in
handling
prunes
must
be
conditioned
before
storing
in
drying
prunes
shrink
about
in
weight
that
is
for
every
three
pounds
of
fresh
fruit
you
get
one
pound
of
finished
product
smaller
fruits
such
as
red
and
black
raspberries
blackberries
huckleberries
dewberries
strawberries
and
blueberries
are
simply
washed
and
then
put
to
dry
berries
must
not
be
dried
too
hard
if
too
much
moisture
is
removed
they
will
not
resume
their
original
form
when
soaked
in
water
but
the
material
must
be
dried
sufficiently
or
it
will
mold
have
you
often
tasted
extremely
seedy
dried
berries
they
were
dried
until
they
rattled
stop
the
drying
as
soon
as
the
berries
fail
to
stain
the
hand
when
pressed
to
obtain
the
most
satisfactory
results
soft
fruits
should
be
only
one
layer
deep
on
the
drying
trays
fruits
contain
about
to
per
cent
water
and
when
dried
sufficiently
still
retain
from
to
per
cent
of
water
so
it
is
a
good
plan
to
weigh
before

chapter

how
to
dry
vegetables
vegetable
drying
is
a
little
more
complicated
than
fruit
drying
just
as
vegetable
canning
is
more
complicated
than
fruit
canning
blanching
is
an
important
part
of
the
operation
it
makes
vegetable
drying
satisfactory
as
well
as
easy
and
simple
just
as
it
makes
vegetable
canning
possible
however
there
is
one
difference
between
blanching
vegetables
for
canning
and
blanching
them
for
drying
after
repeated
experiments
it
has
been
found
that
for
drying
purposes
it
is
best
to
blanch
all
vegetables
in
steam
rather
than
in
boiling
water
in
vegetable
canning
we
blanch
almost
all
vegetables
in
boiling
water
usually
steaming
only
the
members
of
the
green
family
so
remember
that
for
drying
all
vegetables
are
blanched
in
steam
to
do
this
steaming
you
can
use
your
ordinary
household
steamer
such
as
you
use
for
steaming
brown
breads
and
suet
puddings
or
you
can
simply
place
a
colander
over
boiling
water
in
a
kettle
do
not
allow
the
colander
to
touch
the
water
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
possess
a
pressure
cooker
steam
the
vegetables
for
drying
in
it
blanching
is
necessary
for
many
reasons
it
removes
the
strong
flavors
objectionable
to
many
people
beans
cabbage
turnips
and
onions
have
too
strong
a
flavor
if
dried
without
blanching
furthermore
it
starts
the
color
to
flowing
just
as
it
does
in
canning
it
removes
the
sticky
coating
round
vegetables
most
vegetables
have
a
protective
covering
to
prevent
evaporation
the
removal
of
this
covering
by
blanching
facilitates
drying
blanching
also
relaxes
the
tissues
drives
out
the
air
and
improves
the
capillary
attraction
and
as
a
result
the
drying
is
done
in
a
much
shorter
period
products
dry
less
rapidly
when
the
texture
is
firm
and
the
tissue
contains
air
blanching
checks
the
ripening
processes
the
ripening
process
is
destroyed
by
heating
and
this
is
to
be
desired
for
drying
purposes
blanching
kills
the
cells
and
thus
prevents
the
flavor
so
often
noticed
in
unblanched
products
it
prevents
changes
after
drying
which
otherwise
will
occur
unless
the
water
content
is
reduced
to
about
five
per
cent
thorough
blanching
makes
the
product
absolutely
sanitary
no
insect
eggs
exist
after
blanching
and
there
is
one
precaution
that
must
be
followed
do
not
blanch
too
long
blanching
too
long
seems
to
break
down
the
cell
structure
so
that
the
product
can
not
be
restored
to
its
original
color
shape
or
size
follow
the
blanching
for
drying
just
as
carefully
as
you
follow
the
blanching
for
canning
after
the
blanching
comes
the
for
the
benefit
of
new
canning
and
drying
enthusiasts
let
me
explain
that
by
we
mean
plunging
the
product
immediately
into
a
pan
of
very
cold
water
or
holding
it
under
the
faucet
until
the
product
is
thoroughly
cooled
do
not
let
the
product
stand
in
cold
water
as
it
would
then
lose
more
food
value
and
absorb
too
much
water
you
can
the
product
without
removing
it
from
the
colander
strainer
or
steamer
in
which
it
is
steamed
plunge
the
vessel
containing
the
product
into
the
cold
water
the
checks
the
cooking
sets
the
coloring
matter
which
was
started
to
flowing
in
the
blanching
process
and
it
makes
the
product
much
easier
to
handle
let
us
now
see
just
exactly
what
we
must
do
when
we
want
to
dry
sweet
corn
more
of
which
is
dried
than
of
any
other
vegetable
all
other
vegetables
are
dried
in
the
same
way
as
is
corn
the
only
difference
being
in
the
length
of
the
blanching
and
drying
period
all
vegetables
are
prepared
for
drying
just
as
they
are
prepared
for
table
use
when
drying
corn
select
ears
that
are
young
and
tender
and
if
possible
freshly
gathered
products
for
drying
should
be
in
the
same
perfect
condition
as
you
have
them
for
table
use
if
wilted
and
old
it
is
not
worth
while
drying
them
remove
the
husks
and
the
silk
and
steam
on
the
cob
for
fifteen
minutes
this
sets
the
milk
besides
doing
many
other
things
which
blanching
by
steam
always
does
after
the
steaming
the
corn
and
then
cut
it
from
the
cob
using
a
very
sharp
and
flexible
knife
cut
the
grains
fine
but
only
halfway
down
to
the
cob
scrape
out
the
remainder
of
the
grains
being
careful
not
to
scrape
off
any
of
the
chaff
next
to
the
cob
when
field
corn
is
used
the
good
plump
cooking
stage
is
the
proper
degree
of
ripeness
for
satisfactory
drying
the
corn
should
be
thoroughly
drained
as
this
facilitates
drying
you
can
easily
remove
all
surface
moisture
by
placing
the
corn
between
two
towels
and
patting
them
it
is
now
ready
for
drying
the
corn
may
be
dried
in
the
sun
but
if
so
it
is
advisable
first
to
dry
it
in
the
oven
for
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
and
then
finish
the
drying
in
the
sun
never
attempt
sun
drying
in
moist
weather
the
corn
may
be
dried
by
artificial
heat
either
on
top
of
the
stove
or
in
the
oven
using
either
plates
properly
covered
or
any
commercial
dryer
work
quickly
after
the
blanching
and
and
get
the
corn
heated
as
quickly
as
possible
in
order
to
prevent
souring
you
get
often
when
canning
if
you
do
not
work
quickly
enough
and
you
will
get
sour
vegetables
in
drying
if
you
work
too
slowly
where
artificial
heat
is
used
begin
at
a
lower
temperature
and
gradually
increase
it
as
the
corn
is
drying
stir
it
from
time
to
time
and
readjust
the
trays
if
necessary
after
the
drying
comes
the
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
corn
is
sufficiently
dry
vegetables
at
this
point
differ
from
fruits
fruits
are
dried
only
until
leathery
whereas
vegetables
are
dried
until
they
are
they
must
crackle
and
snap
this
test
is
sometimes
used
to
see
if
the
product
is
sufficiently
dry
put
some
of
it
in
a
covered
glass
jar
with
a
crisp
soda
cracker
and
keep
them
there
for
a
few
hours
if
the
cracker
loses
its
crispness
and
becomes
soft
and
damp
there
is
still
too
much
moisture
in
the
product
and
it
should
be
dried
a
little
longer
to
obtain
the
degree
of
dryness
required
after
the
corn
is
it
should
like
all
other
vegetables
and
fruits
be
conditioned
this
means
to
pour
them
from
one
bag
or
box
to
another
once
a
day
for
three
or
four
days
this
enables
you
to
notice
any
moisture
that
may
be
left
in
the
dried
food
foods
that
show
any
traces
of
moisture
should
be
returned
to
the
drying
tray
for
a
short
time
notice
lima
beans
particularly
as
they
require
a
longer
conditioning
period
than
most
vegetables
after
the
conditioning
in
order
to
kill
all
insects
and
destroy
all
eggs
it
is
advisable
to
place
the
vegetables
on
trays
and
heat
them
in
an
oven
for
half
an
hour
at
a
temperature
of
degrees
fahrenheit
store
directly
from
the
oven
dried
vegetables
are
stored
just
as
are
dried
fruits
in
cans
cracked
jars
that
can
not
be
used
for
canning
fiber
containers
cheesecloth
paper
bags
or
paraffin
containers
in
storing
your
dried
products
keep
in
mind
these
things
protection
from
moisture
insects
rats
mice
dust
and
light
if
you
observe
all
these
things
it
is
unnecessary
to
have
containers
all
varieties
of
string
beans
can
be
dried
but
only
those
fit
for
table
use
should
be
used
old
stringy
tough
beans
will
remain
the
same
kind
of
beans
when
dried
there
are
two
ways
of
preparing
string
wax
or
snap
beans
for
drying
wash
remove
stem
tip
and
string
cut
or
break
into
pieces
to
one
inch
long
blanch
three
to
ten
minutes
according
to
age
and
freshness
in
steam
place
on
trays
or
dryer
if
you
have
a
vegetable
slicer
it
can
be
used
for
slicing
the
beans
prepare
as
above
then
blanch
the
whole
beans
after
thread
them
on
coarse
strong
thread
making
long
necklaces
of
them
hang
them
above
the
stove
or
out
of
doors
until
dry
lima
beans
should
be
shelled
from
the
pod
and
then
blanched
two
to
five
minutes
if
young
and
tender
if
larger
and
more
mature
blanch
five
to
ten
minutes
okra
is
blanched
for
three
minutes
if
the
pods
are
young
and
small
dry
them
whole
older
pods
should
be
cut
into
slices
small
tender
pods
are
sometimes
strung
on
stout
thread
and
hung
up
to
dry
peppers
may
be
dried
by
splitting
on
one
side
removing
the
seed
drying
in
the
air
and
finishing
the
drying
in
the
dryer
at
degrees
fahrenheit
a
more
satisfactory
method
is
to
place
peppers
in
a
biscuit
pan
in
the
oven
and
heat
until
the
skins
blister
or
to
steam
them
until
the
skin
softens
peel
split
in
half
take
out
seed
and
dry
at
to
degrees
in
drying
peppers
like
the
pimento
do
not
increase
heat
too
quickly
but
dry
slowly
and
evenly
small
varieties
of
red
peppers
may
be
spread
in
the
sun
until
wilted
and
the
drying
finished
in
the
dryer
or
they
may
be
dried
entirely
in
the
sun
peppers
often
are
dried
whole
if
large
they
can
be
strung
on
thread
if
small
the
whole
plant
can
be
hung
up
to
dry
shell
peas
and
blanch
three
to
five
minutes
and
then
spread
in
a
single
layer
on
trays
to
dry
when
drying
the
very
tender
young
sugar
peas
use
the
pod
also
wash
and
cut
in

blanch
six
minutes
and
remove
surplus
moisture
before

when
drying
beets
always
select
young

grown
tender
beets
steam
twenty
to
thirty
minutes
or
until
the
skin
cracks
dip
in
cold
water
peel
and
slice
into
to
inch
slices
then
dry
carrots
having
a
large
woody
core
should
not
be
dried
blanch
six
minutes
carrots
are
often
sliced
lengthwise
into
pieces
about
inch
thick
parsnips
celeriac
and
salsify
are
prepared
in
the
same
way
as
are
carrots
onions
should
be
held
under

while
peeling
and
slicing
to
avoid
smarting
of
the
eyes
they
should
be
sliced
into
to
inch
slices
blanch
five
minutes
remove
superfluous
moisture
and
dry
leeks
are
handled
as
are
onions
select
heads
of
cabbage
and
remove
all
loose
outside
leaves
split
the
cabbage
remove
the
hard
woody
core
and
slice
the
remainder
of
the
head
with
a
kraut
slicer
or
cutter
or
with
a
large
sharp
knife
blanch
five
to
ten
minutes
and
dry
spinach
and
parsley
should
be
carefully
washed
steam
and
dry
if
the
spinach
is
sliced
the
drying
will
be
greatly
facilitated
beet

and
dry
until

may
be
omitted
but
the
product
will
be
very
much
inferior
in
flavor
irish
potatoes
can
not
be
satisfactorily
dried
unless
they
are
first
cooked
otherwise
they
will
discolor
all
root
vegetables
must
be
thoroughly
cleaned
otherwise
an
earthy
flavor
may
cling
to
them
one
decayed
root
may
seriously
affect
several
pots
of
vegetable
soup
general
suggestions
all
vegetables
should
be
completely
dried
in
from
two
to
hours
materials
should
be
turned
or
stirred
several
times
to
secure
a
uniform
product
if
heat
is
used
guard
against
scorching
the
door
is
left
open
if
an
oven
is
used
the
temperature
should
be
about
degrees
at
the
beginning
and
usually
should
not
exceed
degrees
onions
string
beans
and
peas
will
yellow
at
more
than
degrees
a
thermometer
is
essential
to
successful
drying
by
artificial
heat
it
is
impossible
to
give
definite
lengths
of
times
for
the
completion
of
sun
drying
as
this
varies
not
only
with
different
products
but
with
the
weather
a
sultry
rainy
day
is
the
worst
for
drying
vegetables
should
be
stone
dry
succulent
vegetables
and
fruits
contain
from
to
per
cent
of
water
and
when
dried
sufficiently
still
retain
from
to
per
cent
so
it
is
a
good
plan
to
weigh
before
and
after
drying
as
a
check
the
product
should
lose
from
to
of
its
weight
work

chapter

every
step
in
brining
we
have
learned
how
to
preserve
fruit
and
vegetables
by
canning
and
drying
and
now
we
are
going
to
learn
another
method
to
preserve
foods
in
which
salt
is
used
we
use
this
salt
method
for
vegetables
it
is
not
adapted
to
fruits
we
may
pickle
apples
pears
and
peaches
but
we
ferment
brine
and
only
vegetables
this
salt
method
is
not
a
substitute
for
drying
or
canning
but
just
an
additional
method
we
may
employ
every
thrifty
housewife
of
wants
her
shelves
of
canned
foods
her
boxes
of
dried
foods
and
her
crocks
of
salted
foods
each
kind
has
its
proper
function
to
perform
in
the
household
one
can
not
take
the
place
of
the
other
for
women
on
the
farm
salting
is
a
salvation
in
busy
seasons
when
canning
and
drying
seem
an
impossibility
a
great
many
vegetables
can
be
saved
by
this
method
in
a
very
short
time
the
labor
required
is
very
small
as
no
cooking
is
necessary
a
good
supply
of
salt
is
the
one
necessity
besides
the
saving
of
time
salting
saves
jars
which
are
absolutely
necessary
in
canning
old
containers
can
be
used
if
they
are
thoroughly
cleansed
the
vegetables
can
be
put
in
any
container
so
long
as
it
holds
water
and
is
not
made
of
metal
metal
containers
should
not
be
used
old
kegs
butter
and
lard
tubs
if
stoneware
jars
or
crocks
chipped
preserve
jars
glass
jars
with
missing
covers
and
covered
enamel
buckets
can
all
be
utilized
avoid
using
tubs
made
of
pitch
or
soft
pine
unless
coated
with
melted
paraffin
as
they
impart
a
flavor
to
the
vegetables
maple
is
the
best
three
methods
of
salting
food
there
are
three
ways
of
preserving
food
by
salting
first
fermentation
with
dry
salting
second
fermentation
in
brine
or
brining
and
third
salting
without
fermentation
or
dry
salting
dry
salting
fermentation
with
dry
salting
consists
in
packing
the
material
with
a
small
amount
of
salt
no
water
is
used
for
the
salt
will
extract
the
water
from
the
vegetables
and
this
forms
a
brine
this
is
the
simplest
process
of
all
three
and
is
used
mostly
for
cabbage
to
make
sauerkraut
proceed
as
follows
the
outside
green
leaves
of
the
cabbage
should
be
removed
just
as
in
preparing
the
head
for
boiling
never
use
any
decayed
or
bruised
leaves
quarter
the
heads
and
shred
the
cabbage
very
finely
there
are
shredding
machines
on
the
market
but
if
one
is
not
available
use
a
slaw
cutter
or
a
large
sharp
knife
after
the
cabbage
is
shredded
pack
at
once
into
a
clean
barrel
keg
or
tub
or
into
an
earthenware
crock
holding
four
or
five
gallons
the
smaller
containers
are
recommended
for
household
use
when
packing
distribute
the
salt
as
uniformly
as
possible
using
one
pound
of
salt
to
forty
pounds
of
cabbage
sprinkle
a
little
salt
in
the
container
and
put
in
a
layer
of
three
or
four
inches
of
shredded
cabbage
then
pack
down
with
a
wooden
utensil
like
a
potato
masher
repeat
with
salt
cabbage
and
packing
until
the
container
is
full
or
the
shredded
cabbage
is
all
used
press
the
cabbage
down
as
tightly
as
possible
and
apply
a
cloth
and
then
a
glazed
plate
or
a
board
cover
which
will
go
inside
the
holder
if
using
a
wooden
cover
select
wood
free
from
pitch
such
as
basswood
on
top
of
this
cover
place
stone
bricks
or
other
weights
use
flint
or
granite
avoid
the
use
of
limestone
sandstone
or
marble
these
weights
serve
to
keep
vegetables
beneath
the
surface
of
the
liquid
the
proportion
of
salt
to
food
when
fermenting
with
dry
salt
is
a
quarter
pound
of
salt
to
ten
pounds
of
food
do
not
use
more
for
the
product
will
taste
too
salty
allow
fermentation
to
proceed
for
ten
days
or
two
weeks
if
the
room
is
warm
in
a
cellar
or
other
cool
place
three
to
five
weeks
may
be
required
skim
off
the
film
which
forms
when
fermentation
starts
and
repeat
this
daily
if
necessary
to
keep
this
film
from
becoming
a
scum
when
gas
bubbles
cease
to
rise
when
you
strike
the
side
of
the
container
fermentation
is
complete
if
there
is
a
scum
it
should
be
removed
as
a
final
step
pour
very
hot
melted
paraffin
over
the
brine
until
it
forms
a
layer
from
a
quarter
to
a
thick
to
prevent
the
formation
of
the
scum
which
occurs
if
the
weather
is
warm
or
the
storage
place
is
not
well
cooled
the
cabbage
may
be
used
as
soon
as
the
bubbles
cease
to
rise
if
scum
forms
and
remains
the
cabbage
will
spoil
you
may
can
the
cabbage
as
soon
as
bubbles
cease
to
rise
and
fermentation
is
complete
to
can
fill
jars
adjust
rubbers
and
partly
seal
sterilize
minutes
in
bath
or
minutes
in
outfit
at
five
to
ten
pounds
pressure
the
vital
factor
in
preserving
the
material
by
this
method
is
the
lactic
acid
which
develops
in
fermentation
if
the
vegetables
are
covered
with
a
very
strong
brine
or
are
packed
with
a
fairly
large
amount
of
salt
lactic
acid
fermentation
and
also
the
growth
of
other
forms
of
bacteria
and
molds
are
prevented
this
method
of
preservation
is
especially
applicable
to
those
vegetables
which
contain
so
little
sugar
that
sufficient
lactic
acid
can
not
be
formed
by
bacterial
action
to
insure
their
preservation
in
the
method
of
vinegar
pickling
the
acetic
acid
of
the
vinegar
acts
as
a
preservative
like
the
lactic
acid
produced
by
fermentation
sometimes
brining
precedes
pickling
in
vinegar
and
often
the
pickling
is
modified
by
the
addition
of
sugar
and
spices
which
add
flavor
as
well
as
helping
to
preserve
the
fruit
or
vegetables
in
some
cases
olive
oil
or
some
other
table
oil
is
added
to
the
vinegar
as
in
the
making
of
oil
cucumber
pickles
besides
sauerkraut
string
beans
beet
tops
turnip
tops
greens
kale
and
dandelions
are
adapted
for
fermentation
with
dry
salting
string
beans
should
be
young
tender
and
not
overgrown
remove
the
tip
ends
and
strings
cut
or
break
into
pieces
about
two
inches
long
wash
the
beet
and
turnip
tops
as
well
as
all
greens
in
order
to
remove
dirt
and
grit
weigh
all
products
that
are
to
be
salted
for
salting
a
supply
of
ordinary
fine
salt
which
can
be
purchased
in
bulk
for
about
two
cents
a
pound
is
most
satisfactory
for
general
use
table
salt
will
do
very
well
but
it
is
rather
expensive
if
large
quantities
of
vegetables
are
to
be
preserved
the
rather
coarse
salt
known
in
the
trade
as
ground
alum
salt
which
is
used
in
freezing
ice
cream
can
be
used
rock
salt
because
of
its
coarseness
and
impurities
should
not
be
used
a
weight
must
be
used
the
size
of
the
weight
depends
on
the
quantity
of
material
being
preserved
for
a
keg
a
weight
of
ten
pounds
will
be
sufficient
but
if
a
larger
barrel
is
used
a
heavier
weight
will
be
needed
the
weight
should
be
sufficient
to
extract
the
juices
to
form
a
brine
which
will
cover
the
top
in
about
hours
if
a
brine
does
not
form
it
may
be
necessary
to
add
more
stones
after
the
material
has
stood
a
while
there
always
will
be
more
or
less
bubbling
and
foaming
of
the
brine
during
the
first
stages
of
fermentation
after
this
ceases
a
thin
film
will
appear
which
will
rapidly
spread
over
the
whole
surface
and
quickly
develop
into
a
heavy
folded
membrane
this
scum
is
a
growth
of
organisms
which
feed
upon
the
acid
formed
by
fermentation
if
allowed
to
grow
undisturbed
it
will
eventually
destroy
all
the
acid
and
the
fermented
material
will
spoil
to
prevent
mold
from
forming
it
is
necessary
to
exclude
the
air
from
the
surface
of
the
brine
perhaps
the
best
method
is
to
cover
the
surface
over
the
board
and
round
the
weight
with
very
hot
melted
paraffin
if
the
paraffin
is
hot
enough
to
make
the
brine
boil
when
poured
in
the
paraffin
will
form
a
smooth
even
layer
before
hardening
upon
solidifying
it
forms
an
seal
oils
such
as
cottonseed
oil
or
the
tasteless
liquid
petroleum
may
also
be
used
for
this
purpose
as
a
measure
of
safety
with
crocks
it
is
advisable
to
cover
the
top
with
a
cloth
soaked
in
melted
paraffin
put
the
cover
in
place
before
the
paraffin
hardens
after
sealing
with
paraffin
the
containers
should
be
set
where
they
will
not
be
disturbed
until
the
contents
are
to
be
used
any
attempt
to
remove
them
from
one
place
to
another
may
break
the
paraffin
seal
and
necessitate
resealing
some
vegetables
which
do
not
contain
sufficient
water
are
better
fermented
by
covering
them
with
a
weak
brine
those
which
are
the
most
satisfactory
when
fermented
in
this
way
are
cucumbers
string
beans
green
tomatoes
beets
beet
tops
turnip
tops
corn
and
green
peas
the
general
directions
for
this
brining
are
as
follows
wash
the
vegetables
drain
off
the
surplus
water
and
pack
them
in
a
keg
crock
or
other
utensil
until
it
is
nearly
full
within
about
three
inches
of
the
top
of
the
vessel
prepare
a
weak
brine
as
follows
to
each
gallon
of
water
used
add
pint
of
vinegar
and
of
a
cup
of
salt
and
stir
until
the
salt
is
entirely
dissolved
the
vinegar
is
used
primarily
to
keep
down
the
growth
of
injurious
bacteria
until
the
ferment
starts
but
it
also
adds
to
the
flavor
spices
may
be
added
if
desired
the
amount
of
brine
necessary
to
cover
the
vegetables
will
be
equal
to
about
the
volume
of
the
material
to
be
fermented
for
example
if
a
keg
is
to
be
packed
two
and
gallons
will
be
needed
it
is
best
to
make
up
at
one
time
all
the
brine
needed
on
one
day
a
clean
tub
or
barrel
can
be
used
for
mixing
the
brine
pour
the
brine
over
the
vegetables
and
cover
set
the
vessel
and
its
contents
away
in
a
moderately
warm
room
to
ferment
when
fermentation
ceases
the
container
should
be
placed
in
a
cool
cellar
or
storeroom
and
the
surface
of
the
liquid
treated
to
prevent
mold
before
adding
the
paraffin
or
cottonseed
oil
any
scum
or
mold
which
may
have
formed
on
the
surface
of
the
liquid
should
be
removed
by
skimming
these
general
directions
can
always
be
followed
with
successful
results
but
some
modifications
are
desirable
for
certain
vegetables
cucumbers
dill
style
to
pickle
cucumbers
wash
the
cucumbers
and
pack
into
a
clean
barrel
keg
or
crock
on
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
place
a
layer
of
dill
weed
and
a
handful
of
mixed
spice
add
another
layer
of
dill
and
another
handful
of
spice
when
the
barrel
is
half
full
and
when
almost
full
add
a
third
layer
if
a
keg
or
crock
is
used
the
amount
of
dill
and
spice
can
be
reduced
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
receptacle
when
the
container
has
been
filled
to
within
a
few
inches
of
the
top
add
a
layer
of
covering
material
beet
leaves
or
grape
leaves
about
an
inch
thick
if
any
spoilage
should
occur
on
the
surface
this
layer
will
protect
the
vegetables
beneath
press
down
with
a
clean
board
weighted
with
bricks
or
stone
make
the
brine
as
given
in
the
general
rules
add
sufficient
brine
to
cover
the
material
and
allow
it
to
stand
hours
then
make
the
time
necessary
for
complete
fermentation
to
occur
depends
upon
the
temperature
in
a
warm
place
five
days
to
a
week
may
suffice
in
a
cool
cellar
three
to
four
weeks
the
dill
and
spices
may
be
omitted
in
which
case
we
then
have
plain
cucumbers
string
beans
remove
the
ends
and
strings
from
the
beans
and
cut
into
pieces
about
two
inches
long
pack
in
the
container
cover
with
brine
and
ferment
green
tomatoes
green
tomatoes
should
be
packed
whole
and
prepared
as
cucumbers
the
dill
and
spice
may
be
added
if
desired
beets
beets
must
be
scrubbed
thoroughly
and
packed
whole
if
peeled
or
sliced
before
being
fermented
the
beets
lose
considerable
color
and
flavor
beet
tops
and
turnip
tops
these
should
be
washed
thoroughly
and
packed
into
the
container
without
being
cut
up
peas
green
peas
should
be
shelled
and
packed
in
the
same
way
as
string
beans
it
is
advisable
to
use
fairly
small
containers
for
peas
so
that
the
quantity
opened
up
will
be
used
before
it
has
a
chance
to
spoil
corn
husk
and
clean
the
silk
from
the
corn
wash
and
place
the
ears
on
end
in
the
jar
packing
the
jar
nearly
full
pour
the
brine
over
the
ears
add
cover
and
weights
fermented
corn
has
a
sour
taste
which
may
not
be
relished
if
the
corn
is
eaten
alone
for
this
reason
it
will
be
preferable
in
most
cases
to
preserve
corn
by
canning
drying
or
by
salting
without
fermentation
fermented
corn
however
may
be
used
in
the
preparation
of
some
dishes
such
as
chowders
omelets
and
so
forth
where
its
flavor
will
be
masked
to
some
extent
by
the
other
ingredients
to
some
people
this
peculiar
acid
taste
of
fermented
corn
is
not
at
all
objectionable
salting
without
fermentation
in
this
method
the
vegetables
are
packed
with
enough
salt
to
prevent
fermentation
or
the
growth
of
yeasts
or
molds
the
vegetables
preserved
most
satisfactorily
by
this
method
are
dandelions
beet
tops
turnip
tops
spinach
kale
chard
cabbage
cauliflower
string
beans
green
peas
and
corn
the
following
directions
should
be
followed
the
vegetables
should
be
washed
drained
and
weighed
the
amount
of
salt
needed
will
be
a
quarter
of
the
weight
of
the
vegetables
kegs
or
crocks
make
satisfactory
containers
put
a
layer
of
vegetables
about
an
inch
thick
on
the
bottom
of
the
container
cover
this
with
salt
continue
making
alternate
layers
of
vegetables
and
salt
until
the
container
is
almost
filled
the
salt
should
be
evenly
distributed
so
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
use
more
salt
than
the
quantity
required
in
proportion
to
the
weights
of
the
vegetables
that
are
used
cover
the
surface
with
a
cloth
and
a
board
of
glazed
plate
place
a
weight
on
these
and
set
aside
in
a
cool
place
if
sufficient
liquor
to
cover
the
vegetables
has
not
been
extracted
pour
in
enough
strong
brine
one
pound
of
salt
to
two
quarts
of
water
to
cover
the
surface
round
the
corner
the
top
layer
of
vegetables
should
be
kept
under
the
brine
to
prevent
molding
there
will
be
some
bubbling
at
first
as
soon
as
this
stops
set
the
container
where
it
will
not
be
disturbed
until
ready
for
use
seal
by
pouring
very
hot
paraffin
over
the
surface
string
beans
should
be
cut
in
pieces
peas
should
be
shelled
cabbage
should
be
shredded
in
the
same
way
as
for
sauerkraut
corn
however
requires
somewhat
different
treatment
and
the
directions
for
salting
it
are
as
follows
salted
corn
husk
the
ears
of
corn
and
remove
the
silk
cook
in
boiling
water
for
about
ten
minutes
to
set
the
milk
cut
off
the
corn
from
the
cob
with
a
sharp
knife
weigh
the
corn
and
pack
in
layers
with
a
quarter
its
weight
of
fine
salt
as
described
above
some
experts
insist
on
blanching
and
all
vegetables
for
without
fermentation
they
say
that
though
it
is
not
necessary
it
makes
the
tissues
softer
and
consequently
they
are
more
easily
penetrated
by
the
salt
furthermore
when
preparing
these
products
for
the
table
the
salt
soaks
out
more
readily
and
the
products
cook
much
more
quickly
if
they
have
been
blanched
so

curing
smoking
and
preserving
meat
many
farmers
seem
to
have
more
trouble
with
the
curing
of
meats
than
with
the
slaughtering
this
part
of
the
work
is
indeed
very
important
as
it
determines
whether
one
will
have
good
tasting
cured
meat
or
meat
that
is
too
salty
or
possibly
that
is
far
removed
from
the
original
taste
of
the
raw
product
it
is
worth
every
farmer
or
farmerette
attention
to
spend
some
time
on
this
problem
as
it
pays
so
well
in
the
resulting
good
tasting
meat
why
not
have
a
superior
grade
of
meat
as
easily
as
a
poor
grade
work
carefully
and
accurately
done
will
produce
good
results
while
work
slovenly
or
carelessly
done
can
produce
nothing
but
poor
results
to
cure
meat
so
that
it
is
not
only
delicious
but
has
good
keeping
qualities
is
an
art
and
accomplishment
worth
striving
for
a
pride
in
this
work
is
just
as
fine
and
worth
while
as
the
housewife
pride
in
her
culinary
skill
or
the
pride
of
any
other
professional
in
his
or
her
line
of
work
we
are
thinking
of
food
and
its
problems
as
never
before
and
it
behooves
us
all
to
put
more
time
thought
care
and
skill
on
all
things
that
pertain
to
foods
and
as
meat
is
such
an
essential
item
in
our
diet
meat
problems
should
receive
their
due
attention
all
meat
that
is
to
be
cured
should
always
be
thoroughly
cooled
and
cut
into
the
desired
convenient
sizes
before
it
is
put
into
the
brine
or
packed
in
dry
salt
the
pieces
most
commonly
used
for
curing
are
the
ham
shoulder
and
bacon
pieces
from
pork
from
beef
we
use
the
cheaper
tougher
cuts
such
as
the
plate
shoulder
and
chuck
ribs
mutton
is
seldom
cured
and
preserved
the
ham
should
be
cut
off
at
the
hock
joint
the
spare
ribs
taken
out
of
the
bacon
and
the
ragged
edges
trimmed
off
smooth
if
ragged
edges
or
scraggy
ends
are
left
these
portions
will
become
too
dry
in
the
curing
and
will
practically
be
wasted
after
all
the
animal
heat
is
removed
from
the
meat
and
it
is
properly
cut
it
is
then
ready
for
the
curing
if
salt
is
put
on
the
meat
before
the
animal
heat
is
all
removed
it
will
have
a
tendency
to
shrink
the
muscles
and
form
a
coating
on
the
outside
which
will
not
allow
the
generating
gases
to
escape
meat
should
never
be
in
a
frozen
condition
when
the
salt
is
added
as
the
frost
will
prevent
the
proper
penetration
of
the
brine
and
uneven
curing
will
be
the
result
methods
of
curing
meat
the
two
most
common
methods
of
curing
meat
are
first
the
brine
or
sugar
cure
process
and
second
the
process
for
general
farm
use
the
brine
cured
process
is
the
better
it
requires
less
time
less
effort
and
not
such
an
exacting
place
for
the
work
on
most
farms
it
is
impossible
to
secure
a
desirable
place
in
which
to
do
the
as
the
meat
is
exposed
to
rats
cats
flies
and
other
insects
the
requires
considerable
time
to
rub
and
salt
the
meat
at
different
times
while
the
only
attention
that
is
necessary
for
is
to
properly
prepare
and
pack
the
meat
in
the
vessel
and
prepare
the
brine
for
it
utensils
for
curing
if
possible
use
a
round
container
for
the
curing
it
is
easier
to
put
the
meat
in
tightly
and
the
space
can
be
used
to
better
advantage
a
hardwood
barrel
of
some
kind
is
excellent
sirup
molasses
or
lard
barrels
which
have
been
thoroughly
cleaned
are
very
satisfactory
if
you
use
a
vinegar
or
an
oil
barrel
it
should
be
well
burned
on
the
inside
before
using
stone
crocks
or
jars
are
sometimes
used
but
they
are
expensive
and
cumbersome
to
handle
besides
the
constant
danger
of
loss
of
brine
from
breakage
preservatives
for
curing
the
meat
the
farmer
usually
uses
salt
salt
peter
white
or
brown
sugar
or
molasses
these
are
the
necessary
preservatives
the
others
such
as
boracic
acid
borax
and
soda
are
often
used
for
sweetening
the
brine
and
to
keep
it
from
spoiling
but
are
not
absolutely
essential
the
salt
extracts
moisture
and
acts
as
a
preservative
the
sugar
or
molasses
imparts
a
nice
flavor
and
has
a
tendency
to
keep
the
muscle
tissue
soft
in
contrast
to
the
salt
which
has
a
tendency
to
make
it
hard
and
dry
so
the
salt
and
sugar
have
two
distinct
functions
to
perform
the
one
to
harden
and
preserve
the
other
to
soften
and
sweeten
if
you
have
a
favorite
recipe
that
has
proved
satisfactory
and
you
want
to
use
sorghum
or
molasses
instead
of
sugar
add
one
pound
more
of
the
molasses
if
you
have
been
accustomed
to
using
pounds
of
sugar
then
use
pounds
of
the
other
sweetening
salt
peter
is
not
absolutely
necessary
as
far
as
the
preserving
is
concerned
but
it
helps
to
hold
the
red
color
of
the
lean
meat
if
salt
peter
is
not
used
the
lean
meat
will
be
gray
in
color
it
may
possibly
be
a
little
tenderer
if
the
salt
peter
is
not
used
as
the
salt
peter
tends
to
harden
the
meat
chili
salt
peter
can
be
substituted
in
place
of
salt
peter
if
only
as
much
is
used
the
sugar
brine
cure
all
formulas
for
the
sugar
brine
cure
are
practically
the
same
varying
only
a
little
in
the
proportions
of
sugar
salt
and
salt
peter
if
you
have
a
formula
that
you
have
tried
for
years
and
have
found
it
to
be
satisfactory
there
is
no
reason
you
should
attempt
a
new
one
but
for
those
who
want
to
try
a
different
formula
or
recipe
i
will
give
you
this
reliable
one
that
is
widely
used
and
indorsed
by
several
agricultural
colleges
the
container
should
be
scalded
thoroughly
sprinkle
a
layer
of
salt
over
the
bottom
and
over
each
layer
of
meat
as
it
is
packed
in
skin
down
when
full
cover
meat
with
boards
and
weight
down
with
a
stone
so
that
all
will
be
below
the
brine
which
is
made
as
follows
weigh
out
for
each
pounds
of
meat
pounds
of
salt
pounds
of
sugar
preferably
brown
or
pounds
of
molasses
and
ounces
of
salt
peter
dissolve
all
in
gallons
of
water
this
should
be
boiled
and
when
thoroughly
cooled
cover
the
meat
seven
days
after
brine
is
put
on
meat
should
be
repacked
in
another
barrel
in
reverse
order
the
pieces
that
were
on
top
should
be
placed
on
the
bottom
the
brine
is
poured
over
as
before
this
is
repeated
on
the
fourteenth
and
days
thus
giving
an
even
cure
to
all
pieces
bacon
should
remain
in
the
brine
from
four
to
six
weeks
and
hams
six
to
eight
weeks
depending
on
the
size
of
the
pieces
when
cured
each
piece
should
be
scrubbed
with
tepid
water
and
hung
to
drain
several
days
before
smoking
no
two
pieces
should
come
in
contact
for
all
curing
always
use
dairy
salt
and
salt
as
the
latter
contains
starch
to
keep
it
dry
and
this
starch
may
cause
the
meat
to
spoil
if
you
carefully
follow
these
directions
you
will
have
delicious
hams
and
bacon
corned
beef
it
is
desirable
to
have
an
ample
supply
of
corned
beef
on
hand
for
this
any
part
of
the
beef
may
be
used
but
the
parts
usually
selected
are
the
plate
rump
and
brisket
which
are
the
tougher
cuts
of
the
meat
the
brisket
and
plate
are
especially
good
because
of
the
character
of
the
fat
which
is
somewhat
like
a
tissue
cut
all
around
the
meat
to
about
the
same
thickness
so
that
it
will
make
an
even
layer
in
the
barrel
it
is
best
to
remove
the
bone
although
this
is
not
necessary
be
sure
to
start
the
pickling
or
curing
while
the
meat
is
perfectly
fresh
but
well
chilled
do
not
wait
like
some
farmers
do
until
they
think
the
meat
is
beginning
to
spoil
and
then
salt
it
down
just
to
save
it
allow
ten
pounds
of
dairy
salt
to
each
pounds
of
meat
sprinkle
a
layer
of
the
salt
in
the
bottom
of
the
crock
barrel
or
whatever
container
is
used
have
the
salt
about
of
an
inch
in
depth
after
the
layer
is
in
the
bottom
of
the
container
put
the
cuts
of
meat
in
as
closely
as
possible
making
the
layer
five
or
six
inches
in
thickness
then
put
on
another
layer
of
salt
following
that
with
another
layer
of
meat
repeat
until
the
meat
and
salt
have
all
been
packed
in
the
barrel
care
being
taken
to
reserve
salt
enough
for
a
good
layer
on
the
top
cover
the
meat
with
a
board
and
weight
down
with
a
stone
and
an
weight
do
not
allow
any
meat
to
project
from
the
salt
or
mold
will
start
and
the
brine
will
spoil
in
a
short
time
let
the
meat
stand
prepare
a

by
boiling
pounds
salt
pounds
brown

or
pounds
molasses
ounces
baking
soda
ounces
salt
peter
and
gallons
water
for
every
pounds
of
meat
this
quantity
of
brine
should
be
sufficient
to
cover
that
amount
remove
any
scum
that
rises
to
the
surface
and
filter
the
hot
brine
through
muslin
set
the
brine
aside
best
to
become
perfectly
cold
before
using
in
the
morning
tip
the
container
in
which
the
meat
is
packed
so
that
all
liquor
which
has
separated
from
the
meat
over
night
may
drain
off
cover
the
meat
with
the
cold
brine
put
the
container
in
a
cool
place
the
curing
will
be
more
satisfactory
if
the
meat
is
left
at
a
temperature
of
about
degrees
never
let
the
temperature
go
above
degrees
and
there
is
some
risk
with
even
a
temperature
of
degrees
if
it
is
continuous
the
sugar
or
molasses
in
the
brine
has
a
tendency
to
ferment
in
a
warm
place
after
about
five
days
the
meat
should
be
overhauled
and
repacked
putting
the
pieces
which
were
previously
on
the
bottom
on
top
pour
back
the
same
brine
and
five
days
later
repeat
the
overhauling
this
may
seem
like
some
trouble
and
possibly
look
like
a
useless
waste
of
time
but
it
is
well
worth
while
as
it
insures
a
more
rapid
and
uniform
curing
of
the
meat
when
unpacking
the
meat
watch
the
brine
to
see
that
it
is
not
ropy
or
moldy
if
you
find
either
condition
existing
remove
the
meat
and
rinse
each
piece
with
cold
water
and
after
scalding
the
container
pack
the
meat
as
at
first
with
a
little
salt
scald
and
skim
the
brine
and
after
it
is
cold
pour
it
on
the
meat
as
before
you
can
use
corned
beef
if
necessary
after
a
week
in
the
cure
but
it
is
not
thoroughly
cured
until
it
has
been
from
to
days
in
the
brine
if
kept
for
sixty
days
it
will
be
salty
enough
to
need
freshening
before
cooking
if
the
meat
has
been
corned
during
the
winter
and
is
to
be
kept
until
summer

as
it
is
more

the

meats
of
course
many
farmers
never
attempt
to
smoke
their
cured
meats
but
use
them
directly
from
the
brine
but
if
possible
it
is
more
satisfactory
to
smoke
them
before
using
for
several
reasons
first
the
process
of
smoking
helps
to
preserve
the
meat
the
creosote
formed
by
the
combustion
of
the
wood
closes
the
pores
of
the
meat
to
a
great
extent
thus
excluding
the
air
and
helping
it
to
keep
and
at
the
same
time
makes
the
meat
objectionable
to
insects
in
the
second
place
pickled
or
cured
meats
taste
better
and
are
more
palatable
if
smoked
of
course
the
smoking
must
be
properly
done
and
the
right
kind
of
fuel
must
be
used
the
smokehouse
and
the
smoke
it
is
not
necessary

it
is

delightful
addition
to

a

is
of
great
advantage
one

will
answer
for
many
families
this
is
the
ideal
arrangement
and
it
can
easily
be
managed
if
you
are
progressive
and
anxious
enough
to
supply
your
family
with
delicious
meat
the
year
around
saving
time
and
money
if
however
you
have
to
do
your
own

only
a

quantity
at
a
time

will
answer
overheating
of

be
guarded

used
as
they
give
a
disagreeable
flavor
to
the
meat
if
it
is
impossible
to
get
hardwood
use
corncobs
rather
than
soft
wood
the
corncobs
will
leave
a
dirty
deposit
on
the
meat
which
is
carbon
it
is
not
objectionable
only
from
the
standpoint
of
looks
the
meat
which
you
are
going
to
smoke
should
be
removed
from
the
brine
the
day
before
the
smoking
a
half
hour
soaking
in
cold
water
prevents
a
crust
of
salt
from
forming
on
the
outside
do
not
hang
the
meat
so
that
any
two
pieces
touch
as
this
would
prevent
uniform
smoking
always
start
with
a
slow
fire
so
as
to
warm
the
meat
up
gradually
to
hours
of
heat
as
near
degrees
as
possible
will
be
sufficient
under
most
circumstances
how
to
store
smoked
meats
a
dry
cool
cellar
or
attic
where
there
is
good
circulation
is
a
good
place
for
storage
if
the
meat
is
to
be
used
soon
the
meat
can
hang
without
coverings
but
for
long
keeping
you
will
have
to
wrap
it
when
cold
in
waxed
paper
and
then
in
burlap
muslin
or
canvas
bags
and
then
hang
it
after
it
is
tied
very
tightly
to
prevent
insects
from
getting
in
in
a
room
with
a
cool
uniform
temperature
some
farmers
get
satisfactory
results
by
wrapping
the
meats
in
strong
bags
and
then
burying
them
in
oat
bins
sausage
frequently
when
animals
are
butchered
on
the
farm
there
are
often
wholesome
portions
of
the
carcass
that
are
not
used
all
trimmings
cheeks
liver
tongue
breast
and
other
pieces
can
be
made
into
bologna
headcheese
or
some
other
form
of
sausage
sausage
making
is
an
art
worth
acquiring
there
is
always
a
good
demand
for
fresh
and
smoked
country
sausage
so
if
you
wish
to
sell
some
you
will
have
no
trouble
in
finding
a
market
for
your
product
if
it
is
a
good
one
to
make
sausage
you
should
have
a
meat
grinder
which
is
an
absolute
essential
on
every
farm
if
you
do
not
have
one
already
then
buy
a
no
or
no
in
addition
to
the
grinder
you
will
need
a
stuffer
attachment
which
costs
very
little
a
knife
cord
string
a
clean
tube
and
casings
or
muslin
bags
will
complete
your
equipment
the
muslin
bags
can
be
of
any
size
but
the
easiest
to
handle
are
inches
long
and
inches
in
diameter
if
the
sausage
is
stuffed
into
these
bags
they
must
be
paraffined
for
home
use
if
you
do
not
want
to
bother
with
casings
or
bags
put
the
sausage
in
stone
crocks
or
tin
pans
with
a
layer
of
lard
or
paraffin
on
top
the
best
sausage
is
made
by
using
parts
of
lean
meat
to
one
of
fat
when
using
the
grinder
distribute
the
lean
and
fat
meat
as
uniformly
as
possible
you
are
not
necessarily
limited
to
pork
sausage
for
there
are
many
other
delicious
varieties
you
can
make
they
vary
in
the
different
kinds
of
meat
used
and
in
the
different
seasonings
and
spices
breakfast
sausage
has
bread
added
to
it
frankfurters
are
smoked

sausage
in
casings
liver
sausage
has
pork
and
beef
or
veal
and
bread
in
it
and
blood
sausage
as
its
name
suggests
has
blood
preferably
from
a
hog
added
to
it
then
there
is
tomato
sausage
which
is
made
of
pulp
from
fresh
tomatoes
pork

summer
sausage
is
made
in
the
winter
and
kept
for
use
during
the
summer
after
being
dried
and
cured
it
will
keep
for
months
brain
sausage
is
delicious
to
make
it
calves
brains
are
mixed
with
lean
pork
cambridge
sausage
has
rice
added
to
it
headcheese
is
usually
made
from
the
hog
head
but
odds
and
ends
also
can
be
used
not
only
from
pork
but
from
beef
and
veal
scrapple
usually
means
the
head
and
feet
of
hogs
but
it
can
be
made
from
any
hog
meat
it
is
a
good
food
as
it
uses
cornmeal
it
makes
a
change
from
fried
mush
and
most
men
working
on
a
farm
relish
it
sausage
can
be
made
from
mutton
mixed
with
pork
in
much
the
same
way
as
beef
is
used
for
similar
purposes
a
general
formula
would
be
parts
of
mutton
to
parts
pork
with
seasonings
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
good
and
meats
together
with
several
varieties
of
sausages
you
can
feel
you
are
well
equipped
to
feed
your
family
with
its
share
of
meat
everything
will
have
been
utilized
nothing
will
have
been
wasted
you
produced
your
own
meat
you
slaughtered
and
cured
and
smoked
it
and
put
all
trimmings
and
other
into
appetizing
food
for
your
family
and
you
have
saved
money
you
have
utilized
things
at
hand
and
required
no
transportation
facilities
and
best
of
all
you
have
the
very
finest
in
the
land
for
your
family
and
that
gives
one
a
perfectly
justifiable
pride
in

them
eggs
must
be
preferably
not
more
than
two
or
three
days

this
is
the
reason
why
it
is
much
more
satisfactory
to
put
away
eggs
produced
in
one
own
chicken
yard
or
one

infertile
eggs
are
best
if
they
can

the
protective
gelatinous
covering
over

are
not
desirable
since
they
increase
the
liability
of

it
must
be
remembered
that
the

bottom
crack
first
and
that
those
in

bottom
of
the

are
the
last
to
be
removed
for

eggs
can
be
put
up
in

the

in
the
household
method
of

there
are
many
satisfactory
methods
of
storing
eggs
the
commercial
method
is
that
of
cold
storage
and
if
it
were
not
for
this
method
winter
eggs
would
be
beyond
the
average
purse
the
fact
that
eggs
have
been
held
in
cold
storage
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
are
of
low
quality
carefully
handled
eggs
often
are
of
better
quality
than
fresh
local
eggs
that
have
been
improperly
cared
for
in
the
home
they
may
be
packed
by
several
methods
salt
oats
or
bran
covering
them
with
vaseline
butter
lard
paraffin
or
prepared
ointments
immersion
in
brine
salicylic
acid
water
glass
sodium
silicate
or
limewater
any
of
these
methods
will
keep
the
eggs
for
short
periods
if
stored
in
a
cool
place
the
salt
oats
and
bran
are
very
satisfactory
the
ointments
also
are
satisfactory
the
water
glass
and
limewater
will
keep
eggs
without
loss
for
a
year
however
it
is
not
wise
to
put
down
more
eggs
than
is
necessary
to
tide
over
the
period
of
high
price
water
glass
method
water
glass
is
known
to
the
chemist
as
sodium
silicate
it
can
be
purchased
by
the
quart
from
druggists
or
poultry
supply
men
it
is
a
pale
yellow
odorless
sirupy
liquid
it
is
diluted
in
the
proportion
of
one
part
of
silicate
to
nine
parts
of
distilled
water
rain
water
or
other
water
any
case
the
water
should
be
boiled
and
then
allowed
to
half
fill
the
vessel
with
this
solution
and
place
the
eggs
in
it
being
careful
not
to
crack
them
the
eggs
can
be
added
a
few
at
a
time
until
the
container
is
filled
be
sure
to
keep
about
two
inches
of

cover
the
crock
to
prevent
evaporation
and
place
it

that
has
evaporated
with

limewater
method
limewater
is
also
satisfactory
for
preserving
eggs
and
is
slightly
less
expensive
than
water
glass
a
solution
is
made
by
placing
two
or
three
pounds
of
unslaked
lime
in
five
gallons
of
water
which
has
been
boiled
and
allowed
to
cool
and
allowing
the
mixture
to
stand
until
the
lime
settles
and
the
liquid
is
clear
the
eggs
should
be
placed
in
a
clean
earthenware
jar
or
other
suitable
vessel
and
covered
to
a
depth
of
two
inches
with
the
liquid
remove
the
eggs
as
desired
rinse
in
clean
cold
water
and
use
immediately
if
using
the
limewater
method
add
a
little
of
the
lime
sediment
to
insure
a
constantly
saturated
solution
if
a
thin
white
crust
appears
on
the
limewater
solution
it
is
due
to
the
formation
of
calcium
carbonate
coming
in
contact
with
the
air
and
consequently
does
no
harm
candling

every
one
knows
that
some

the
ease
with
which
the
good
ones
can
be
picked

can
be
that

the
equipment
for
candling
usually
consists
of
either
a
wooden
a
metal
or
a
cardboard
box
and
a
kerosene
lamp
or
an
electric
light
a
very
inexpensive

use
can
be
made
from
a
large

cut
a
hole
about
the
size
of
a

can
easily
be
judged

may
be
dimly
seen
in
the
center
of
the

indicate
that
the

is
stale
if
the

if
you
are
in
doubt
about
the
quality
of
any
eggs
you
are
candling
break
a
few
of
them
into
a
dish
and
examine
them
this
is
an
excellent
way
to
learn
to
know
how

when

to
be

remove
them
as

rinse
in
clean
cold
water
and
use
immediately
eggs
preserved
in
water
glass
can
be
used
for
soft
boiling
or
poaching
up
to
november
before
boiling
such
eggs
prick
a
tiny
hole
in
the
large
end
of
the
shell
with
a
needle
to
keep
them
from
cracking
as
the
preservative
seals
the
pores
of
the
shell
and
prevents
the
escape
of
gases
which
is
possible
in
the
strictly
fresh
egg
they
are
satisfactory
for
frying
until
about
december
from
that
time
until
the
end
of
the
usual
storage
period
that
is
until
march
they
can
be
used
for
omelettes
scrambled
eggs
custards
cakes
and
general
cookery
as
the
eggs
age
the
white
becomes
thinner
and
is
harder
to
beat
the
yolk
membrane
becomes
more
delicate
and
it
is
correspondingly
difficult
to
separate
the
whites
from
the
yolks
sometimes
the
white
of
the
egg
is
tinged
pink
after
very
long
keeping
in
water
glass
this
is
due
probably
to
a
little
iron
which
is
in
the
sodium
silicate
but
which
apparently
does
not
injure
the
eggs
for
food
purposes

home
storage
of
vegetables
towards
the
end
of
the
canning
season
most
housewives
have
used
every
available
glass
jar
and
tin
can
and
hesitate
about
purchasing
a
new
supply
they
have
dried
and
brined
many
products
and
yet
they
feel
and
rightly
so
that
they
would
like
still
more
vegetables
for
winter
use
there
still
remains
another
method
that
they
may
employ
to
provide
themselves
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
vegetables
and
these
vegetables
can
be
in
the
fresh
state
too
neither
canned
dried
pickled
or
salted
but
fresh
canning
drying
pickling
and
salting
are
essential
and
necessary
but
they
can
not
take
the
place
of
storage
to
keep
vegetables
in
their
natural
state
is
the
easiest
and
simplest
form
of
food
preservation
of
course
you
must
take
proper
precautions
against
freezing
and
decay
if
you
do
this
you
can
have
an
abundant
supply
of
many
kinds
of
fresh
vegetables
all
winter
where
climatic
and
living
conditions
will
permit
storage
costs
but
little
money
and
little
effort
and
yet
it
is
very
satisfactory
there
are
many
vegetables
that
can
be
stored
to
good
advantage
they
are
beets
brussels
sprouts
beans
celery
carrots
chicory
or
endive
cabbage
cauliflower
lima
beans
onions
sweet
potatoes
squash
winter
salsify
or
vegetable
oyster
tomatoes
turnips
to
get
good
results
in
any
kind
of
storage
you
must
observe
four
things
proper
ventilation
proper
regulation
of
temperature
sufficient
moisture
good
condition
of
vegetables
when
stored
there
are
six
different
ways
to
store
vegetables
they
are
cellar
storage
pit
storage
outdoor
cellar
or
cave
storage
attic
storage
sand
boxes
and
pantry
storage
cellar
storage
we
will
first
of
all
consider
cellar
or
basement
storage
one
of
the
most
convenient
places
for
the
storage
of
vegetables
is
a
cool
and
reasonably
dry
cellar
underneath
the
house
this
cellar
must
have
windows
or
some
method
of
ventilation
must
not
be
too
warm
and
not
so
cold
that
food
will
freeze
if
there
is
proper
ventilation
there
can
be
some
dampness
without
injury
to
the
vegetables
if
your
cellar
or
basement
floods
easily
or
has
water
standing
in
it
anywhere
it
should
not
be
used
for
vegetable
storage
if
there
is
a
furnace
in
the
cellar
or
basement
a
small
room
as
far
as
possible
from
the
heating
plant
should
be
partitioned
off
do
not
build
a
room
in
the
middle
of
the
cellar
for
two
sides
of
the
room
should
consist
of
outside
walls
if
possible
have
two
outside
windows
for
proper
regulation
of
the
temperature
and
for
good
ventilation
if
you
can
not
have
two
windows
have
one
a
very
good
arrangement
for
constant
circulation
of
air
consists
in
having
a
inserted
through
one
of
the
lower
panes
of
the
window
to
admit
cold
air
one
of
the
upper
panes
of
the
window
can
be
removed
to
allow
for
the
escape
of
warm
air
that
is
of
course
if
the
window
is
made
of
nine
or
twelve
small
panes
of
squares
of
glass
in
severely
cold
weather
this
upper
pane
can
be
replaced
or
the
opening
stuffed
up
in
some
way
if
you
do
not
have
an
old
you
can
make
a
wooden
flue
of
old
boards
or
old
discarded
boxes
most
cellars
and
basements
are
now
made
with
concrete
floors
the
ideal
floor
for
storage
purposes
is
an
earth
floor
however
we
can
put
two
or
three
inches
of
sand
on
our
concrete
floors
and
get
good
results
sprinkle
the
sand
with
water
from
time
to
time
put
the
vegetables
that
are
to
be
stored
in
boxes
baskets
barrels
or
crates
use
containers
that
hold
only
two
or
three
bushels
apiece
if
larger
boxes
or
barrels
are
used
there
is
always
danger
of
heating
and
decay
of
course
proper
precautions
should
be
taken
against
mice
an
excellent
way
to
prevent
wilting
of
crops
and
shrinkage
is
to
put
moist
leaves
oak
or
maple
in
the
containers
with
the
vegetables
moist
sand
is
sometimes
used
but
it
is
much
heavier
to
handle
than
the
leaves
it
is
no
difficult
matter
to
rake
the
lawn
when
you
are
ready
to
store
the
vegetables
the
vegetables
that
are
adapted
for
cellar
storage
are
beets
cabbage
carrots
celery
parsnips
potatoes
salsify
and
turnips
pit
storage
there
are
two
kinds
of
pits
that
may
be
used
for
storage
those
that
are
not
and
those
which
are
some
vegetables
are
not
injured
by
being
held
in
a
frozen
condition
during
the
winter
months
cabbage
is
not
injured
by
moderate
frost
cabbage
and
parsnips
will
stand
freezing
and
a
little
thawing
so
they
can
be
put
in
pits
or
better
still
boxes
or
barrels
set
into
the
ground
may
be
used
make
the
pit
mound
shaped
if
the
earth
is
mounded
around
the
box
barrel
or
pit
surface
water
can
not
run
in
if
using
this
kind
of
storage
do
not
store
the
products
until
both
the
ground
and
the
products
are
frozen
solid
the
idea
is
to
keep
the
vegetables
frozen
or
to
have
very
few
freezings
and
thawings
and
those
few
should
be
gradual
after
the
pit
has
been
made
or
the
box
or
barrel
has
been
set
into
the
ground
and
filled
with
vegetables
it
should
be
covered
first
with
a
piece
of
burlap
or
carpet
then
with
a
board
cover
and
finally
with
straw
or
similar
material
when
taken
from
the
pit
the
vegetables
can
be
thawed
out
over
night
in
cold
water
after
which
they
can
be
kept
in
the
cellar
for
a
short
length
of
time
the
pits
for
keeping
vegetables
free
from
frost
must
be
carefully
and
thoughtfully
made
but
they
are
cheap
and
are
very
useful
and
practical
when
caves
or
cellars
are
not
convenient
the
pit
for
storing
vegetables
should
always
be
placed
in
as
a
place
as
possible
a
shallow
excavation
should
be
made
from
one
to
two
feet
deep
four
feet
wide
and
as
long
as
desired
line
the
pit
with
straw
hay
or
leaves
then
place
the
vegetables
in
a
conical
pile
on
the
straw
cover
the
vegetables
with
six
inches
of
the
material
used
in
making
the
lining
this
is
covered
with
three
or
four
inches
of
earth
the
straw
is
allowed
to
extend
up
through
the
earth
at
the
top
of
the
pile
thus
assuring
ventilation
when
it
becomes
colder
add
more
covering
to
the
pit
by
another
layer
of
straw
and
a
layer
of
earth
in
very
cold
climates
a
layer
of
manure
or
corn
stalks
will
afford
protection
against
frost
it
is
well
to
make
several
small
pits
rather
than
one
larger
one
for
the
reason
that
when
a
pit
has
once
been
opened
it
is
difficult
to
protect
the
remaining
vegetables
from
frost
it
is
advisable
to
store
several
varieties
of
vegetables
in
one
pit
so
that
when
each
pit
is
opened
you
have
a
variety
of
vegetables
if
you
follow
this
plan
separate
the
various
crops
by
using
straw
or
leaves
pits
are
entered
by
chopping
a
hole
through
the
frozen
earth
at
one
end
large
enough
to
reach
into
or
crawl
into
after
the
vegetables
have
been
obtained
keep
the
hole
stuffed
and
covered
most
carefully
and
deeply
with
old
sacks
and
straw
if
the
smaller
pits
are
used
a
decidedly
better
arrangement
take
out
all
the
vegetables
in
the
pit
and
those
that
are
not
needed
for
immediate
consumption
can
be
placed
in
the
cellar
storage
room
or
other
cool
place
until
needed
do
not
use
those
pits
if
you
live
where
winter
rains
are
abundant
as
the
pits
will
become
water
soaked
and
the
vegetables
will
suffer
more
or
less
decay
outdoor
cellar
storage
outdoor
cellars
or
caves
may
be
cheaply
built
for
more
or
less
temporary
use
or
they
may
be
very
expensively
built
of
concrete
brick
or
clay
blocks
of
course
the
latter
are
permanent
storing
places
and
offer
perfect
storage
for
potatoes
carrots
cabbages
parsnips
beets
turnips
and
salsify
the
objectionable
features
of
indoor
cellar
storage
is
that
such
storage
does
not
furnish
ideal
conditions
for
keeping
the
vegetables
fresh
for
any
great
length
of
time
the
objectionable
feature
to
the
pit
storage
is
the
inaccessibility
to
these
pits
during
severe
weather
the
outdoor
cellar
or
cave
overcomes
both
these
objections
the
outdoor
cellar
or
cave
is
an
underground
structure
preferably
built
in
a
hillside
and
fully
covered
with
earth
except
at
one
end
only
where
the
entrance
is
located
if
there
are
doors
at
both
ends
it
is
almost
impossible
to
prevent
freezing
in
very
cold
weather
the
cave
door
should
fit
perfectly
and
there
should
be
a
hatchway
or
door
over
the
steps
leading
down
to
the
cave
door
a
very
satisfactory
inexpensive
cellar
can
be
made
by
digging
an
excavation
about
deep
and
in
this
erecting
a
frame
by
setting
posts
in
rows
near
the
dirt
walls
saw
these
posts
off
at
uniform
height
and
place
plates
on
their
tops
on
these
plates
place
rafters
board
up
completely
with
the
exception
of
the
entrance
cover
the
whole
with
dirt
or
sod
and
in
cold
climates
add
a
layer
of
straw
or
fodder
a
ventilation
must
be
provided
in
the
roof
at
the
back
end
a
sewer
tile
with
the
bell
end
up
makes
a
very
good
flue
a
dirt
floor
is
satisfactory
as
it
contains
moisture
if
there
is
any
seepage
use
a
drain
tile
to
carry
it
off
the
more
pretentious
permanent
cellars
are
provided
with
air
spaces
to
furnish
insulation
are
provided
with
large
ventilation
shafts
through
the
roof
and
cold
air
intakes
under
the
floor
thorough
drainage
is
obtained
by
placing
a
line
of
tile
around
the
outside
wall
and
also
by
having
the
air
intake
serve
as
a
drain
for
surplus
water
that
might
get
into
the
cave
the
floor
is
cement
or
concrete
such
a
cave
is
expensive
but
is
a
permanent
structure
and
a
good
addition
to
any
farm
or
estate
if
properly
made
it
is
possible
to
maintain
a
temperature
of
to
degrees
without
much
fluctuation
during
the
winter
months
this
kind
of
storage
is
not
only
adapted
for
vegetables
but
apples
as
well
it
is
better
adapted
to
the
northern
eastern
and
western
states
than
to
the
southern
states
where
it
is
likely
to
be
warm
at
the
time
the
vegetables
are
ready
for
storage
when
making
the
cave
have
it
as
near
as
possible
to
the
kitchen
door
sometimes
caves
are
made
so
that
they
can
be
entered
from
the
house
cellar
or
porch
attic
storage
some
vegetables
such
as
onions
squashes
sweet
potatoes
and
pumpkins
can
be
stored
in
the
attic
in
crates
which
allow
free
circulation
of
air
they
must
be
absolutely
free
from
bruises
and
must
be
well
ripened
and
cured
to
cure
the
vegetables
expose
them
to
the
air
for
a
few
days
in
the
shade
remove
the
tops
of
onions
before
storing
the
attic
is
much
better
for
storing
onions
than
the
basement
squashes
are
susceptible
to
cold
and
moisture
so
are
suitable
for
the
attic
be
very
careful
in
handling
the
squashes
to
prevent
breaking
the
stems
off
watch
pumpkins
and
squash
carefully
and
at
the
first

sand
boxes
in

are
desirable
for
beets
turnips
carrots
winter
radishes

rutabagas
the

they
are
onions
squashes
pumpkins
and

the
keeping
qualities
of
all
these
vegetables
no
matter
what
storage
is
used
depends
chiefly
upon
their
condition
when

way
is
to

as
few
cellars
are
cool
enough
to

heads
varieties
of

are
the
only
ones
for

it
is
advisable
to
dig

chapter

how
to
market
home
canned
produce
you
have
some
delicious
jellies
jams
canned
fruits
and
vegetables
that
you
wish
to
sell
and
you
do
not
know
just
how
to
go
about
it
there
are
at
your
disposal
several
means
of
selling
through
advertising
through
personal
letters
to
desirable
shops
delicatessens
colleges
etc
by
direct
salesmanship
that
is
by
making
personal
visits
to
the
buyers
either
homes
or
stores
through
jobbers
to
whom
you
pay
a
commission
on
all
sales
through
coöperative
selling
perhaps
the
cheapest
and
easiest
way
for
you
to
handle
your
problem
is
to
employ
the
method
so
much
used
and
that
is
wayside
advertising
wayside
advertising
costs
practically
nothing
and
yet
it
pays
autos
are
everywhere
these
days
you
can
not
take
a
country
ride
without
seeing
many
signboards
at
the
farm
entrances
advertising
chickens
fresh
eggs
vegetables
honey
apples
and
canned
goods
i
have
a
friend
who
drives
miles
every
fall
for
her
honey
she
first
found
it
by
seeing
the
sign
in
front
of
the
farm
and
now
she
returns
year
after
year
because
she
thinks
no
other
honey
is
just
like
it
she
would
never
have
discovered
it
if
that
farm
woman
had
not
been
clever
enough
to
think
of
advertising
her
goods
in
this
cheap
way
my
friend
told
all
her
other
auto
friends
so
the
country
woman
has
a
splendid
outlet
for
her
product
now
if
you
live
on
a
good
road
that
is
patronized
at
all
by
autoists
you
ought
to
get
your
signboard
up
at
once
we
often
pass
a
farm
where
the
sign
fresh
candy
always
tempts
us
to
stop
and
buy
what
autoist
could
resist
that
sign
and
here
miles
from
town
this
clever
woman
is
carrying
on
a
profitable
side
trade
which
is
netting
her
a
nice
little
yearly
income
her
candy
is
good
we
go
often
and
so
do
many
others
she
has
turned
her
profession
into
a
paying
proposition
she
could
send
her
candy
away
by
parcel
post
or
by
some
other
means
but
she
would
not
be
so
far
ahead
as
she
is
now
in
addition
to
your
wayside
advertising
you
could
advertise
in
papers
magazines
etc
many
producers
believe
strongly
in
advertising
in
daily
and
weekly
papers
you
can
quickly
find
out
whether
this
kind
of
advertising
pays
give
it
a
trial
at
least
after
you
have
spent
ten
or
fifteen
dollars
in
advertising
you
ought
to
know
whether
it
pays
use
one
or
two
of
the
city
papers
near
you
taking
the
advice
as
to
the
best
day
of
the
week
on
which
to
run
the
advertisement
the
size
and
the
position
of
the
ad
the
first
cost
of
getting
your
customers
may
seem
high
but
with
good
products
you
could
soon
build
up
a
list
of
people
to
whom
sales
can
be
made
year
after
year
this
form
of
advertising
has
many
advantages
if
your
advertising
copy
is
clever
and
you
have
some
novelty
to
offer
you
ought
to
receive
many
orders
if
orders
come
you
get
the
full
retail
price
the
shipping
charges
are
paid
by
the
customer
and
cash
comes
with
every
order
and
it
means
if
your
customers
are
pleased
that
you
have
permanent
customers
the
initial
cost
is
great
and
there
is
a
risk
but
remember
it
pays
to
advertise
there
are
millions
of
city
women
who
never
can
a
jar
of
fruit
or
put
up
a
single
glass
of
preserves
or
jelly
who
will
be
glad
to
have
you
send
your
goods
direct
to
them
by
parcel
post
but
you
must
get
in
touch
with
these
women
either
through
wayside
advertising
magazine
and
paper
advertising
or
by
direct
salesmanship
although
very
few
women
have
the
time
for
personal
calls
considerable
business
can
be
done
by
letter
writing
to
stores
restaurants
and
in
distant
cities
it
may
be
impossible
for
you
to
go
personally
in
which
case
letters
often
bring
the
desired
results
make
your
letters
and
typewrite
them
do
not
be
discouraged
if
you
do
not
get
many
replies
at
first
as
there
are
at
least
fifty
per
cent
who
pay
no
attention
to
such
letters
but
this
form
of
advertising
usually
pays
another
method
followed
by
many
home
canners
is
that
of
marketing
direct
to
the
retail
grocers
care
being
taken
of
course
to
protect
these
grocers
by
not
selling
to
more
than
one
member
in
a
community
one
of
the
great
advantages
of
this
direct
salesmanship
is
that
little
selling
effort
is
required
on
your
part
after
the
first
arrangements
have
been
made
the
nearby
market
plan
is
greatly
to
be
recommended
because
you
can
keep
in
touch
with
your
selling
concern
build
up
a
line
of
desirable
goods
and
promote
its
sale
by
advertising
of
course
you
can
get
more
money
for
your
goods
if
you
have
time
and
the
opportunity
to
sell
the
consumers
you
will
of
necessity
have
to
sell
cheaper
to
the
grocers
because
they
too
must
make
their
profit
marketing
direct
to
the
consumer
has
a
special
appeal
to
many
people
where
time
is
available
and
the
community
accustomed
to
purchasing
in
this
manner
this
method
offers
great
possibilities
the
profits
are
of
course
higher
but
the
results
more
uncertain
for
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
gauge
the
demands
of
the
public
and
the
canner
must
assume
the
risk
ordinarily
taken
by
the
merchant
it
takes
time
and
patience
to
develop
a
list
of
customers
but
if
you
have
time
in
the
winter
to
do
this
you
will
find
it
will
pay
you
well
if
you
can
get
customers
who
are
willing
to
pay
good
prices
for
quality
scrupulous
cleanliness
and
the
homemade
flavor
you
will
get
a
larger
gross
return
than
if
you
sold
through
merchants
but
if
your
time
is
valuable
it
would
scarcely
pay
you
to
take
individual
orders
and
deliver
goods
there
is
still
another
way
and
that
is
to
market
your
products
in
large
lots
to
jobbers
but
if
this
plan
is
to
be
pursued
successfully
there
must
be
a
reasonably
large
pack
and
wholesale
rates
this
method
produces
more
uniform
profits
year
by
year
for
after
a
reputation
is
established
the
would
not
experience
great
difficulty
in
thus
disposing
of
her
entire
output
by
contract
providing
the
quality
was
high
and
the
price
demands
not
excessive
but
the
greatest
and
best
way
of
all
to
find
a
profitable
market
for
your
things
is
to
coöperate
with
other
canners
in
your
own
neighborhood
and
find
a
market
for
quantity
as
well
as
quality
delicatessens
club
houses
tea
shops
college
dormitories
restaurants
and
hotels
all
pay
good
prices
for
fine
quality
no
big
buyer
will
bother
to
purchase
one
or
two
dozen
of
this
or
that
he
wants
dozens
of
things
one
of
the
very
best
profitable
ways
to
sell
with
little
trouble
is
through
quantities
get
all
the
women
in
your
community
to
bring
together
cans
of
fruit
and
preserves
to
some
marketing
place
find
out
how
many
jars
of
currant
jelly
you
have
how
many
cans
of
peas
and
corn
how
many
of
cherries
and
then
notify
your
buyer
or
prospective
buyer
coöperative
selling
has
been
undertaken
and
found
profitable
in
some
cases
especially
in
localities
frequented
by
the
summer
boarder
or
the
automobile
tourist
sales
are
made
direct
to
customers
who
come
to
the
salesrooms
of
the
organizations
or
to
their
special
sales
in
other
cases
goods
are
sent
by
parcel
post
and
other
means
the
women
in
the
community
can
hire
or
beg
a
room
where
all
the
women
of
the
community
can
sell
their
products
for
individual
profit
this
room
should
be
located
on
the
direct
automobile
road
in
order
to
attract
tourists
and
automobile
parties
an
annual
membership
fee
of
from
cents
to
generally
is
required
for
these
organizations
and
a
charge
of
from
to
per
cent
of
the
selling
price
usually
is
made
to
cover
the
cost
of
selling
in
a
few
instances
the
managing
board
has
been
able
to
secure
an
efficient
person
to
take
charge
of
the
enterprise
for
a
specified
percentage
on
the
sales
wholesale
grocery
concerns
are
interested
in
big
things
orders
can
be
placed
with
them
soda
fountains
in
towns
and
cities
are
excellent
customers
for
the
freshest
eggs
they
can
get
they
are
encroaching
more
and
more
on
the
trade
of
the
restaurants
and
lunch
rooms
many
serve
light
luncheons
and
would
be
interested
in
good
butter
preserves
and
jams
when
you
get
a
list
of
names
and
addresses
write
to
several
dozen
places
tell
what
your
organization
has
in
the
way
of
guaranteed
eggs
homemade
products
and
what
kind
of
service
you
could
offer
in
the
way
of
regular
shipments
when
orders
come
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
look
up
at
your
local
bank
the
responsibility
of
any
customer
so
there
is
little
risk
or
cash
can
be
insisted
upon
with
every
order
although
large
concerns
prefer
to
pay
after
receipt
of
goods
and
bill
each
woman
in
this
coöperative
organization
must
keep
her
goods
up
to
a
certain
standard
for
an
inferior
lot
of
goods
sent
to
a
large
firm
might
ruin
a
reputation
three
things
govern
the
sale
of
canned
products
appearances
quality
and
price
so
many
things
enter
into
consideration
of
prices
obtainable
that
it
is
difficult
to
set
a
standard
which
will
be
applicable
to
different
sections
the
quality
of
the
pack
its
neatness
the
method
of
marketing
and
many
other
matters
must
be
considered
in
deciding
this
point
as
a
general
proposition
however
if
the
products
are
uniformly
high
grade
prices
may
be
obtained
which
are
somewhat
in
excess
of
products
marketed
in
the
same
manner
like
any
other
new
industry
the
selling
should
be
developed
slowly
in
order
to
minimize
the
possibility
of
loss
and
to
assure
stable
business
one
should
study
the
situation
carefully
both
from
the
manufacturing
and
marketing
standpoints
plan
the
season
campaign
before
taking
up
the
work
and
do
not
let
the
enthusiasm
of
the
beginner
interfere
with
good
business
judgment
the
selling
when
rightly
managed
can
be
made
a
successful
business
or
it
can
be
turned
into
a
liability
through
careless
unbusinesslike
methods
and
insufficient
or
unwise
planning
properly
handled
it
will
pay
well
for
the
investment
of
time
and
money
and
offer
opportunity
for
the
disposal
of
surplus
homemade
and
products
of
all
kinds
living
up
to
contracts
care
must
be
taken
not
to
contract
for
more
than
can
be
delivered
this
would
be
bad
business
and
business
principles
must
govern
in
selling
home
products
just
as
in
other
enterprises
if
one
is
to
be
increasingly
successful
from
year
to
year
occasionally
a
quantity
of
fruit
which
will
not
meet
the
rigid
requirements
of
the
canning
business
can
be
turned
into
preserves
jellies
or
fruit
juices
preserves
and
jellies
should
be
marketed
in
glass
and
fruit
juices
in
bottles
although
some
manufacturers
are
now
marketing
some
of
these
products
in
fiber
cups
this
line
of
products
will
require
some
additional
equipment
but
there
is
a
steady
demand
for
such
homemade
things
and
many
women
are
deriving
profits
through
the
sale
of
their
tastily
prepared
jellies
just
as
pickles
and
condiments
have
lined
the
pocketbooks
of
ambitious
housewives
before
now
home
canning
for
the
market
is
essentially
a
matter
of
specializing
and
of
giving
the
consumer
a
better
product
than
he
is
accustomed
to
purchase
too
much
emphasis
can
not
be
placed
upon
the
maintenance
of
a
high
standard
for
goods
care
should
be
taken
that
every
jar
measures
up
to
a
rigid
standard
for
a
single
one
which
falls
below
grade
will
neutralize
the
reputation
and
standing
obtained
by
the
sale
of
a
dozen
jars
of
perfect
product
a
quality
is
necessary
