A LINE'S A SPEECH


  A line's a speech;
  So here's a line
  To say this pedlar's pack
  Of mine
  Is not a book--
  But a journey thro'
  Mountainy places,
  Ever in view
  Of the sea and the fields,
  With the rough wind
  Blowing over the leagues
  Behind!




I AM THE MOUNTAINY SINGER


  I am the mountainy singer--
  The voice of the peasant's dream,
  The cry of the wind on the wooded hill,
  The leap of the fish in the stream.

  Quiet and love I sing--
  The carn on the mountain crest,
  The cailin in her lover's arms,
  The child at its mother's breast.

  Beauty and peace I sing--
  The fire on the open hearth,
  The cailleach spinning at her wheel,
  The plough in the broken earth.

  Travail and pain I sing--
  The bride on the childing bed,
  The dark man labouring at his rhymes,
  The ewe in the lambing shed.

  Sorrow and death I sing--
  The canker come on the corn,
  The fisher lost in the mountain loch,
  The cry at the mouth of morn.

  No other life I sing,
  For I am sprung of the stock
  That broke the hilly land for bread,
  And built the nest in the rock!




WHEN ROOKS FLY HOMEWARD


  When rooks fly homeward
  And shadows fall,
  When roses fold
  On the hay-yard wall,
  When blind moths flutter
  By door and tree,
        Then comes the quiet
        Of Christ to me.

  When stars look out
  On the Children's Path
  And grey mists gather
  On carn and rath,
  When night is one
  With the brooding sea,
        Then comes the quiet
        Of Christ to me.




I SPIN MY GOLDEN WEB


  I spin my golden web in the sun:
  The cherries tremble, the light is done.

  A sudden wind sweeps over the bay,
  And carries my golden web away!




CHERRY VALLEY


  In Cherry Valley the cherries blow:
  The valley paths are white as snow.

  And in their time with clusters red
  The scented boughs are crimsonèd.

  Even now the moon is looking thro'
  The glimmer of the honey dew.

  A petal trembles to the grass,
  The feet of fairies pass and pass.

  By _them_, I know, all beauty comes
  To me, a habitan of slums.

  I sing no rune, I say no line:
  The gift of second sight is mine!




DARKNESS


  Darkness.
  I stop to watch a star shine in the boghole----
  A star no longer, but a silver ribbon of light.
  I look at it, and pass on.




MY FIDIL IS SINGING


  My fidil is singing
  Into the air;
  The wind is stirring,
  The moon is fair.

  A shadow wanders
  Along the road;
  It stops to listen,
  And drops its load.

  Dreams for a space
  Upon the moon,
  Then passes, humming
  My mountain tune.




THE GOAT-DEALER


  Did you see the goat-dealer
  All in his jacket green?
  I met him on the rocky road
  'Twixt this and Baile-doirin.

  A hundred nannies ran before,
  And a she-ass behind,
  And then the old wanderer himself,
  Burnt red with sun and wind.

  He gave me the time-a-day
  And doitered over the hill,
  Walloping his gay ashplant
  And shouting his fill.

  I think I hear him yet,
  Tho' it's a giant's cry
  From where I hailed him first,
  Standing up to the sky.

  Is that Puck Green I see beyond?
  It is, and the stir is there.
  By the holy hat, I know then--
  He's making for Puck Fair!




WHY CRUSH THE CLARET ROSE


  Why crush the claret rose
  That blows
  So rarely on the tree?
  Wherefore the enmity, dear girl,
  Betwixt the rose and thee?
  Art thou not fair enough
  With that dark beauty given thee,
  That thou must crush the rose
  That blows
  So rarely on the tree!




LAMENT OF PADRAIC MOR MAC CRUIMIN OVER HIS SONS


  I am Padraic Mor mac Cruimin,
  Son of Domhnall of the Shroud,
  Piper, like my kind before me,
  To the household of MacLeod.

  Death is in the seed of Cruimin--
  All my music is a wail;
  Early graves await the poets
  And the pipers of the Gael.

  Samhain gleans the golden harvests
  Duly in their tide and time,
  But my body's fruit is blasted
  Barely past the Bealtein prime.

  Cethlenn claims the fairest fighters
  Fitly for her own, her own,
  But my seven sons are stricken
  Where no battle-pipe is blown.

  Flowers of the forest fallen
  On the sliding summer stream--
  Light and life and love are with me,
  Then are vanished into dream.

  Berried branches of the rowan
  Rifled in the wizard wind--
  Clan and generation leave me,
  Lonely on the heath behind.

  Who will soothe a father's sorrow
  When his seven sons are gone?
  Who will watch him in his sleeping?
  Who will wake him at the dawn?

  Seven sons are taken from me
  In the compass of a year;
  Every bone is bose within me,
  All my blood is white with fear.

  Seven youths of brawn and beauty
  Moulder in their mountain bed,
  Up in storied Inis-Scathach
  Where their fathers reaped their bread.

  Nevermore upon the mountain,
  Nevermore in fair or field,
  Shall ye see the seven champions
  Of the silver-mantled shield.

  I will play the "_Cumhadh na Cloinne_"
  Wildest of the rowth of tunes
  Gathered by the love of mortal
  From the olden druid runes.

  Wail ye! Night is on the water;
  Wind and wave are roaring loud--
  _Caoine_ for the fallen children
  Of the piper of MacLeod.




TO A TOWN GIRL


  Violet mystery,
  Ringleted gold,
  Whiteness of whiteness,
  Wherefore so cold?

  Silent you sit there--
  Spirit and mould--
  Darkening the dream
  That must never be told!




A MARCH MOON


  A March moon
  Over the mountain crest,
  _Ceanabhan_ blowing:
  Her neck and breast.

  Arbutus berries
  On the tree head:
  Her mouth of passion,
  Dewy and red.

  Cold as cold
  And hot as hot,
  She loves me . . . .
  And she loves me not!




A THOUSAND FEET UP


  A thousand feet up: twilight.
  Westwards, a clump of firtrees silhouetted against a bank of blue
    cumulus cloud;
  The June afterglow like a sea behind.
  The mountain trail, white and clear where human feet have worn it,
    zigzagging higher and higher till it loses itself in the southern
    skyline.
  A patch of young corn to my right hand, swaying and swaying
    continuously, tho' hardly an air stirs.
  A falcon wheeling overhead.
  The moon rising.
  The damp smell of the night in my nostrils.

  O hills, O hills,
  To you I lift mine eyes!
  I kneel down and kiss the grass under my feet.
  The sense of the mystery and infinity of things overwhelms me,
    annihilates me almost.
  I kneel down, and silently worship.




THE DARK


  This is the dark.
  This is the dream that came of the dark.
  This is the dreamer who dreamed the dream that came of the dark.
  This is the look the dreamer looked who dreamed the dream that came of
    the dark.

  This is the love that followed the look the dreamer looked who dreamed
    the dream that came of the dark.

  This is the breast that fired the love that followed the look the
    dreamer looked who dreamed the dream that came of the dark.

  This is the song was made to the breast that fired the love that
    followed the look the dreamer looked who dreamed the dream that came
    of the dark.

  This is the sword that tracked the song was made to the breast that
    fired the love that followed the look the dreamer looked who dreamed
    the dream that came of the dark.

  This is the rope that swung the sword that tracked the song was made
    to the breast that fired the love that followed the look the dreamer
    looked who dreamed the dream that came of the dark.

  This is the dark that buried the rope that swung the sword that tracked
    the song was made to the breast that fired the love that followed the
    look the dreamer looked who dreamed the dream that came of the dark.

  This is the dark, indeed!




REYNARDINE


  _If by chance you look for me_
  _Perhaps you'll not me find,_
  _For I'll be in my castle--_
  _Enquire for Reynardine!_

  Sun and dark he courted me--
  His eyes were red as wine:
  He took me for his leman,
  Did my sweet Reynardine.

  Sun and dark the gay horn blows,
  The beagles run like wind:
  They know not where he harbours,
  The fairy Reynardine.

  _If by chance you look for me_
  _Perhaps you'll not me find,_
  _For I'll be in my castle--_
  _Enquire for Reynardine!_




SNOW


  Hills that were dark
  At sparing-time last night
  Now in the dawn-ring
  Glimmer cold and white.




I AM THE GILLY OF CHRIST


  I am the gilly of Christ,
  The mate of Mary's Son;
  I run the roads at seeding time,
  And when the harvest's done.

  I sleep among the hills,
  The heather is my bed;
  I dip the termon-well for drink,
  And pull the sloe for bread.

  No eye has ever seen me,
  But shepherds hear me pass,
  Singing at fall of even
  Along the shadowed grass.

  The beetle is my bellman,
  The meadow-fire my guide,
  The bee and bat my ambling nags
  When I have need to ride.

  All know me only the Stranger,
  Who sits on the Saxon's height;
  He burned the bacach's little house
  On last Saint Brigid's Night.

  He sups off silver dishes,
  And drinks in a golden horn,
  But he will wake a wiser man
  Upon the Judgment Morn!

  I am the gilly of Christ,
  The mate of Mary's Son;
  I run the roads at seeding time,
  And when the harvest's done.

  The seed I sow is lucky,
  The corn I reap is red,
  And whoso sings the Gilly's Rann
  Will never cry for bread.




GO, PLOUGHMAN, PLOUGH


  Go, ploughman, plough
  The mearing lands,
  The meadow lands,
  The mountain lands:
  All life is bare
  Beneath your share,
  All love is in your lusty hands.

  Up, horses, now!
  And straight and true
  Let every broken furrow run:
  The strength you sweat
  Shall blossom yet
  In golden glory to the sun.




GO, REAPER


  Go, reaper,
  Speed and reap,
  Go take the harvest
  Of the plough:
  The wheat is standing
  Broad and deep,
  The barley glumes
  Are golden now.

  Labour is hard,
  But it endures
  Like love:
  The land is yours:
  Go reap the life
  It gives you now,
  O sunbrowned master
  Of the plough!




THE GOOD PEOPLE


  The millway path looks like a wraith,
  The lock is black as ink,
  And silently in stream and sky
  The stars begin to blink.

  I see them pass along the grass
  With slow and solemn tread:
  Aoibheall, their queen, is in between--
  A corpse is at their head!

  They wander on with faces wan,
  And dirges sad as wind.
  I know not, but it may be that
  The dead's of human kind.




THE STORM IS STILL, THE RAIN HATH CEASED


  The storm is still, the rain hath ceased
  To vex the beauty of the east:
  A linnet singeth in the wood
  His hermit song of gratitude.

  So shall I sing when life is done
  To greet the glory of the sun;
  And cloud and star and stream and sea
  Shall dance for very ecstasy!




SCARE-THE-CROWS


  Twopence a day for scaring crows--
  Tho' the rain beats and the wind blows!

  The scholars think I've little wit,
  But, God! I've got my share of it.

  Why does the gorbing land-shark
  Leave ploughed rigs for the green park?

  Where little's to find, and nothing's to eat
  But rabbits' droppings and pheasants' meat.

  He knows better than come my way
  Between the mouth and the tail of day.

  For one lick of my hurding wattle
  Would lay him out like a showman's bottle!

  And the thoughts that rise in my crazed head
  When the cloud is low and the wind's dead.

  Where you see only clay and stones
  I see swords and blanching bones. . . .

  But I'll leave you now--it's gone six,
  And the smoke is curling over the ricks.

  And it's hardly like that the land-shark
  Will trouble the furrows after dark.




A CRADLE-SONG


  Sleep, white love, sleep,
  A cedarn cradle holds thee,
  And twilight, like a silver-woven coverlid,
  Enfolds thee.
  Moon and star keep charmèd watch
  Upon thy lying;
  Water plovers thro' the dusk
  Are tremulously crying.
        Sleep, white love mine,
        Till day doth shine.

  Sleep, white love, sleep,
  The daylight wanes, and deeper
  Gathers the blue darkness
  O'er the cradle of the sleeper.
  Cliodhna's curachs, carmine-oared,
  On Loch-da-linn are gleaming;
  Blind bats flutter thro' the night,
  And carrion birds are screaming.
        Sleep, white love mine,
        Till day doth shine.

  Sleep, white love, sleep,
  The holy mothers, Anne and Mary,
  Sit high in heaven, dreaming
  On the seven ends of Eire.
  Brigid sits beside them,
  Spinning lamb-white wool on whorls,
  Singing fragrant songs of love
  To little naked boys and girls.
        Sleep, white love mine,
        Till day doth shine.




TWINE THE MAZES THRO' AND THRO'


  Twine the mazes thro' and thro'
  Over beach and margent pale;
  Not a bawn appears in view,
  Not a sail!

  Round about!
  In and out!
  Thro' the stones and sandy bars
  To the music of the stars!
  The asteroidal fire that dances
  Nightly in the northern blue,
  The brightest of the boreal lances,
  Dances not so light as you,
        Cliodhna!
  Dances not so light as you.




THE FIGHTING-MAN


  A fighting-man he was,
  Guts and soul;
  His blood as hot and red
  As that on Cain's hand-towel.

  A copper-skinned six-footer,
  Hewn out of the rock.
  Who would stand up against
  His hammer-knock?

  Not a sinner--
  No, and not one dared!
  Giants showed clean heels
  When his arm was bared.

  I've seen him swing an anvil
  Fifty feet,
  Break a bough in two,
  And tear a twisted sheet.

  And the music of his roar--
  Like oaks in thunder cleaving;
  Lips foaming red froth,
  And flanks heaving.

  God! a goodly man,
  A Gael, the last
  Of those that stood with Dan
  On Mullach-Maist!




MY MOTHER HAS A WEE RED SHOE


  My mother has a wee red shoe--
  She bought it off a bacach-man;
  And all the neighbours say it's true
  He stole it off a Leath-brogan.
        Bacach-man, bacach-man,
        Where did you get it?
        Faith now, says he,
        In my leather wallet!

  My father has an arrow-head--
  He begged it off poor Peig na Blath;
  And Mor, the talking-woman, said
  She found it in a fairy rath.
        Peig na Blath, Peig na Blath,
        Where did you get it?
        Faith now, says she,
        In my wincey jacket!

  My brother has a copper pot--
  He tryst' it wi' a shuiler-man;
  And gossip says it's like as not
  He truff'd it from a Clobhair-ceann.
        Shuiler-man, shuiler-man,
        Where did you get it?
        Faith now, says he,
        In my breeches' pocket!




BY A WONDROUS MYSTERY


  By a wondrous mystery
  Christ of Mary's fair body
  Upon a middle winter's morn,
  Between the tides of night and day,
  In Ara's holy isle was born.
  Mary went upon her knee
  Travailing in ecstasy,
  And Brigid, mistress of the birth,
  Full reverently and tenderly
  Laid the child upon the earth.
  Then the dark-eyed rose did blow,
  And rivers leaped from out the snow.
  Earth grew lyrical: the grass,
  As the light winds chanced to pass--
  Than magian music more profound--
  Murmured in a maze of sound.
  White incense rose upon the hills
  As from a thousand thuribles,
  And in the east a seven-rayed star
  Proclaimed the news to near and far.
  The shepherd danced, the gilly ran,
  The boatman left his curachan;
  The king came riding on the wind
  To offer gifts of coin and kind;
  The druid dropped his ogham wand,
  And said, "Another day's at hand,
  A newer dawn is in the sky:
  I put my withered sapling by.
  The druid Christ has taken breath
  To sing the runes of life and death."




I GATHER THREE EARS OF CORN


  I gather three ears of corn,
  And the Black Earl from over the sea
  Sails across in his silver ships,
  And takes two out of the three.

  I might build a house on the hill
  And a barn of the speckly stone,
  And tell my little stocking of gold,
  If the Earl would let me alone.

  But he has no thought for me--
  Only the thought of his share,
  And the softness of the linsey shifts
  His lazy daughters wear.

  There is a God in heaven,
  And angels, score on score,
  Who will not see my hearthstone cold
  Because I'm crazed and poor.

  My childer have my blood,
  And when they get their beards
  They will not be content to run
  As gillies to their herds!

  The day will come, maybe,
  When we can have our own,
  And the Black Earl will come to us
  Begging the bacach's bone!




THE TINKERS


  "One _ciarog_ knows another _ciarog_,
  And why shouldn't I know you, you rogue?"
  "They say a stroller will never pair
  Except with one of his kind and care . . ."
  So talked two tinkers prone in the shough--
  And then, as the fun got a trifle rough,
  They flitted: he with his corn-straw bass,
  She with her load of tin and brass:
  As mad a match as you would see
  In a twelvemonth's ride thro' Christendie.
  He roared--they both were drunk as hell:
  She danced, and danced it mighty well!
  I could have eyed them longer, but
  They staggered for the Quarry Cut:
  That half-perch seemed to trouble them more
  Than all the leagues they'd tramped before.
  Some'll drink at the fair the morrow,
  And some'll sup with the spoon of sorrow;
  But whether _they_'ll get as far as Droichid
  The night--well, who knows that but God?




AS I CAME OVER THE GREY, GREY HILLS


  As I came over the grey, grey hills
  And over the grey, grey water,
  I saw the gilly leading on,
  And the white Christ following after.

  Where and where does the gilly lead?
  And where is the white Christ faring?
  They've travelled the four grey sounds of Orc,
  And the four grey seas of Eirinn.

  The moon it set and the wind's away,
  And the song in the grass is dying,
  And a silver cloud on the silent sea
  Like a shrouding sheet is lying.

  But Christ and the gilly will follow on
  Till the ring in the east is showing,
  And the awny corn is red on the hills,
  And the golden light is glowing!




A NORTHERN LOVE-SONG


  Brigidin Ban of the lint-white locks,
  What was it gave you that flaxen hair,
  Long as the summer heath in the rocks?
  What was it gave you those eyes of fire,
  Lip so waxen and cheek so wan?
  Tell me, tell me, Brigidin Ban,
  Little white bride of my heart's desire.

  Was it the Good People stole you away,
  Little white changeling, Brigidin Ban?
  Carried you off in the ring of the dawn,
  Laid like a queen on her purple car,
  Carried you back 'twixt the night and the day;
  Gave you that fortune of flaxen hair,
  Gave you those eyes of wandering fire,
  Lit at the wheel of the southern star;
  Gave you that look so far away,
  Lip so waxen and cheek so wan?
  Tell me, tell me, Brigidin Ban,
  Little white bride of my heart's desire.




TO THE GOLDEN EAGLE


  Wanderer of the mountain,
  Winger of the blue,
  From this stormy rock
  I send my love to you.

  Take me for your lover,
  Dark and fierce and true--
  Wanderer of the mountain,
  Winger of the blue!




A PROPHECY


  "The loins of the Galldacht
   Shall wither like grass"--
   Strange words I heard said
   At the Fair of Dun-eas.

  "A bard shall be born
   Of the seed of the folk,
   To break with his singing
   The bond and the yoke.

  "A sword, white as ashes,
   Shall fall from the sky,
   To rise, red as blood,
   On the charge and the cry.

  "Stark pipers shall blow,
   Stout drummers shall beat,
   And the shout of the north
   Shall be heard in the street.

  "The strong shall go down,
   And the weak shall prevail,
   And a glory shall sit
   On the sign of the Gaodhal.

  "Then Emer shall come
   In good time by her own,
   And a man of the people
   Shall speak from the throne."

   Strange words I heard said
   At the Fair of Dun-eas--
  "The Gaodhaldacht shall live,
   The Galldacht shall pass!"




I MET A WALKING-MAN


  I met a walking-man;
  His head was old and grey.
  I gave him what I had
  To crutch him on his way.
  The man was Mary's Son, I'll swear;
  A glory trembled in his hair!

  And since that blessed day
  I've never known the pinch:
  I plough a broad townland,
  And dig a river-inch;
  And on my hearth the fire is bright
  For all that walk by day or night.




THE NINEPENNY FIDIL


  My father and mother were Irish,
  And I am Irish, too;
  I bought a wee fidil for ninepence,
  And it is Irish, too.
  I'm up in the morning early
  To meet the dawn of day,
  And to the lintwhite's piping
  The many's the tune I play.

  One pleasant eve in June time
  I met a lochrie-man:
  His face and hands were weazen,
  His height was not a span.
  He boor'd me for my fidil--
  "You know," says he, "like you,
  My father and mother were Irish,
  And I am Irish, too!"

  He took my wee red fidil,
  And such a tune he turned--
  The Glaise in it whispered,
  The Lionan in it m'urned.
  Says he, "My lad, you're lucky--
  I wish t' I was like you:
  You're lucky in your birth-star,
  And in your fidil, too!"

  He gave me back my fidil,
  My fidil-stick, also,
  And stepping like a mayboy,
  He jumped the Leargaidh Knowe.
  I never saw him after,
  Nor met his gentle kind;
  But, whiles, I think I hear him
  A-wheening in the wind!

  My father and mother were Irish,
  And I am Irish, too:
  I bought a wee fidil for ninepence,
  And it is Irish, too.
  I'm up in the morning early
  To meet the dawn of day,
  And to the lintwhite's piping
  The many's the tune I play.




GRASSLANDS ARE FAIR


  Grasslands are fair,
  Ploughlands are rare.
  Grasslands are lonely,
  Ploughlands are comely.
  Grasslands breed cattle,
  Ploughlands feed people.
  Grasslands are not wrought,
  Ploughlands swell with thought.




WINTER SONG


  'Twould skin a fairy
  It is so airy,
  And the snow it nips so cold:
  Shepherd and squire
  Sit by the fire,
  The sheep are in the fold.

  You have your wish--
  A reeking dish,
  And rubble walls about;
  So pity the poor
  That have no door
  To keep the winter out!




I FOLLOW A STAR


  I follow a star
  Burning deep in the blue,
  A sign on the hills
  Lit for me and for you!

  Moon-red is the star,
  Halo-ringed like a rood,
  Christ's heart in its heart set,
  Streaming with blood.

  Follow the gilly
  Beyond to the west:
  He leads where the Christ lies
  On Mary's white breast.

  King, priest and prophet--
  A child, and no more--
  Adonai the Maker!
  Come, let us adore.




THE SILENCE OF UNLABOURED FIELDS


  The silence of unlaboured fields
  Lies like a judgment on the air:
  A human voice is never heard:
  The sighing grass is everywhere--
  The sighing grass, the shadowed sky,
  The cattle crying wearily!

  Where are the lowland people gone?
  Where are the sun-dark faces now?
  The love that kept the quiet hearth,
  The strength that held the speeding plough?
  Grasslands and lowing herds are good,
  But better human flesh and blood!




THE BEGGAR'S WAKE


  I watched at a beggar's wake
  In the hills of Bearna-barr,
  And the old men were telling stories
  Of Troy and the Trojan war.

  And a flickering fire of bog-deal
  Burned on the open hearth,
  And the night-wind roared in the chimney,
  And darkness was over the earth.

  And Tearlach Ban MacGiolla,
  The piper of Gort, was there,
  And he sat and he dreamed apart
  In the arms of a sugan chair.

  And sudden he woke from his dream
  Like a dream-frightened child,
  And his lips were pale and trembling,
  And his eyes were wild.

  And he stood straight up, and he cried,
  With a wave of his withered hand,
  "The days of the grasping stranger
  Shall be few in the land!

  "The scrip of his doom is written,
  The thread of his shroud is spun;
  The net of his strength is broken,
  The tide of his life is run. . . ."

  Then he sank to his seat like a stone,
  And the watchers stared aghast,
  And they crossed themselves for fear
  As the coffin cart went past.

  . . . . . . . .

  "At the battle of Gleann-muic-duibh
  The fate the poets foretold
  Shall fall on the neck of the stranger,
  And redden the plashy mould.

  "The bagmen carry the story
  The circuit of Ireland round,
  And they sing it at fair and hurling
  From Edair to Acaill Sound.

  "And the folk repeat it over
  About the winter fires,
  Till the heart of each one listening
  Is burning with fierce desires.

  "In the Glen of the Bristleless Boar
  They say the battle shall be,
  Where Breiffne's iron mountains
  Look on the Western sea.

  "In the Glen of the Pig of Diarmad,
  On Gulban's hither side,
  The battle shall be broken
  About the Samhain tide.

  "Forth from the ancient hills,
  With war-cries strident and loud,
  The people shall march at daybreak,
  Massed in a clamorous crowd.

  "War-pipes shall scream and cry,
  And battle-banners shall wave,
  And every stone on Gulban
  Shall mark a hero's grave.

  "The horses shall wade to their houghs
  In rivers of smoking blood,
  Charging thro' heaps of corpses
  Scattered in whinny and wood.

  "The girths shall rot from their bellies
  After the battle is done,
  For lack of a hand to undo them
  And hide them out of the sun.

  "It shall not be the battle
  Between the folk and the Sidhe
  At the rape of a bride from her bed
  Or a babe from its mother's knee.

  "It shall not be the battle
  Between the white hosts flying
  And the shrieking devils of hell
  For a priest at the point of dying.

  "It shall not be the battle
  Between the sun and the leaves,
  Between the winter and summer,
  Between the storm and the sheaves.

  "But a battle to doom and death
  Between the Gael and the Gall,
  Between the sword of light
  And the shield of darkness and thrall.

  "And the Gael shall have the mastery
  After a month of days,
  And the lakes of the west shall cry,
  And the hills of the north shall blaze.

  "And the neck of the fair-haired Gall
  Shall be as a stool for the feet
  Of Ciaran, chief of the Gael,
  Sitting in Emer's seat!"--

  . . . . . . . .

  At this MacGiolla fainted,
  Tearing his yellow hair,
  And the young men cursed the stranger,
  And the old men mouthed a prayer.

  For they knew the day would come,
  As sure as the piper said,
  When many loves would be parted,
  And many graves would be red.

  And the wake broke up in tumult,
  And the women were left alone,
  Keening over the beggar
  That died at Gobnat's Stone.




THE BESOM-MAN


  Did you see Paidin,
  Paidin, the besom-man,
  Last night as you came by
  Over the mountain?

  A barth of new heather
  He bore on his shoulder,
  And a bundle of whitlow-grass
  Under his oxter.

  I spied him as he passed
  Beyond the carn head,
  But no eye saw him
  At the hill foot after.

  What has come over him?
  The women are saying.
  What can have crossed
  Paidin, the besom-man?

  The bogholes he knew
  As the curlews know them,
  And the rabbits' pads,
  And the derelict quarries.

  He was humming a tune--
  The "Enchanted Valley"--
  As he passed me westward
  Beyond the carn.

  I stood and I listened,
  For his singing was strange:
  It rang in my ears
  The long night after.

  What has come over
  Paidin, the besom-man?
  What can have crossed him?
  The women keep saying.

  They talk of the fairies--
  And, God forgive me,
  Paidin knew _them_
  Like his prayers!

  Will you fetch word
  Up to the cross-roads
  If you see track of him,
  Living or dead?

  The boys are loafing
  Without game or caper;
  And the dark piper
  Is gone home with the birds.




EVERY SHUILER IS CHRIST


  Every shuiler is Christ,
  Then be not hard or cold:
  The bit that goes for Christ
  Will come a hundred-fold.

  The ear upon your corn
  Will burst before its time;
  Your roots will yield a crop
  Without manure or lime.

  And every sup you give
  To crutch him on his way
  Will fill your churn with milk,
  And choke your barn with hay.

  Then when the shuiler begs,
  Be neither hard nor cold;
  The share that goes for Christ
  Will come a hundred-fold.




I WISH AND I WISH


  I wish and I wish
  And I wish I were
  A golden bee
  In the blue of the air,
  Winging my way
  At the mouth of day
  To the honey marges
  Of Loch-ciuin-ban;
  Or a little green drake,
  Or a silver swan,
  Floating upon
  The stream of Aili,
  And I to be swimming
  Gaily, gaily!




I AM THE MAN-CHILD


  I am the man-child. From a virgin womb,
  Begot among the hills of virgin loins,
  The generation of a hundred kings,
  I come. I am the man-child glorious,
  The love-son of the second birth foretold
  By western bards, the fruit of form and strength
  By nature's prophylactic forethought joined
  In marriage with their kind, the crown, the peak,
  The summit of the scheme of things, the pride
  And glory of the hand of God.

                                    Behold!
  Where in the spaces of the morning world
  The sunrise shines my harbinger, the hills
  Leap up, the young winds sing, the rivers dance,
  The leaving forests laugh, the eagles scream;
  For I am one with them, a mate, a brother,
  Bound by nature to the human soul
  That thro' the accidents of nature runs.
  And wherefore do they leap and laugh and sing,
  And dance like vestals on a holyday?
  Because their hearts are glad, and mænad-like,
  They fain would share the frenzied cup they drink
  With me, the man-child glorious.

                                    I am he,
  Even he, the master-mould, the paragon!
  Behold me in my nonage, child and man:
  The ripest grape on beauty's procreant vine,
  The reddest apple of ingathering:
  Perfect in form, of peerless strength, and free
  As Caoilte when he roamed the primal hills
  (Those "wildernesses rich with liberty"),
  A hero that the shocks of chance might strike,
  But never tame, a giant druid-ringed,
  A god-like savage of the golden days
  Ere service shackled action: free itself
  As Oisin when he strayed in Doire-cairn,
  His hand upon the mountain top, his feet
  Fixt in the flowing sea, his holy head
  Crowned by a flight of birds, acclaiming him
  The singer of the dawn.




FRAGMENT


  I stand upon the summit now:
  The falcon, flying from the heath,
  Trails darkly o'er the mountain brow
  And drops into the gloom beneath.
  Night falls, and with it comes the wind
  That blew on Fionn time out of mind,
  When weary of love-feasts and wars
  He left his comrades all behind
  To dream upon the quiet stars.
  Here on the lonely mountain height
  Is ecstasy and living light--
  The living inner light that burns
  With magic caught from those white urns
  That wander thro' the trackless blue
  Forever, touching those they know
  With beauty, and the things that come
  Of beauty. Earth lies at my feet,
  A dumb, vast shadow, vast as dumb.




AT THE WHITENING OF THE DAWN


  At the whitening of the dawn,
  As I came o'er the windy water,
  I saw the salmon-fisher's daughter,
  Nuala ni Cholumain.
        Nuala ni Cholumain,
        Nuala ni Cholumain,
        Palest lily of the dawn
        Is Nuala ni Cholumain.

  In the dark of evendown
  I went o'er the quiet water,
  Dreaming of the fisher's daughter
  And her bothy in the town.
        And I made this simple rann
        Ere the whitening of the dawn,
        Singing to the beauty wan
        Of Nuala ni Cholumain.




WHO ARE MY FRIENDS


  Who are my friends,
  Faithful and true?
  Who but the stars
  That burn in the blue.

  Who but the sun
  That sinketh so red,
  Who but the clay
  That giveth me bread.

  Who but the hills,
  Who but the sea,
  Who but the flowers
  That fold on the tree.

  Who but the moths
  That flutter and pass,
  Who but the lambs
  That cry in the grass.

  Who but the darkness,
  Who but the rain,
  Who but the grave, the grave--
  All else are vain!
        All else are vain!




O GLORIOUS CHILDBEARER


  O glorious childbearer,
  O secret womb,
  O gilded bridechamber, from which hath come the sightly Bridegroom forth,
  O amber veil,
  Thou sittest in heaven, the white love of the Gael.
  Thy head is crowned with stars, thy radiant hair
  Shines like a river thro' the twilight air;
  Thou walkest by trodden ways and trackless seas,
  Immaculate of man's infirmities.




CORONACH


  Come, pipes, sound
  A crooning coronach round,
  Till hill and hollow glen and shadowed lake o'erflow
  With welling music of our woe.
  Beat, beat, ye muffled drums, ye drones and chanters wail,
  With heartbreak of the baffled, battle-broken Gael.
  The clay is deep on Ireland's breast:
  Her proud and bleeding heart is laid at last to rest . .
      To rest . . to rest!




TWILIGHT FALLEN


  Twilight fallen white and cold,
  Child in cradle, lamb in fold;
  Glimmering thro' the ghostly trees,
  Gemini and Pleiades.
        Wounds of Eloim,
        Weep on me!

  Black-winged vampires flitting by,
  Curlews crying in the sky;
  Grey mists wreathing from the ground,
  Wrapping rath and burial mound.
        Wounds of Eloim,
        Weep on me!

  Heard, like some sad Gaelic strain,
  Ocean's ancient voice in pain;
  Darkness folding hill and wood,
  Sorrow drinking at my blood.
        Wounds of Eloim,
        Weep on me!




THE DAWN WHITENESS


  The dawn whiteness.
  A bank of slate-grey cloud lying heavily over it.
  The moon, like a hunted thing, dropping into the cloud.




THE DWARF


  Look at him now, the son,
  And the churchyard twist in his foot,
  Standing there by his mother's door,
  As if he had taken root!

  She crossed a grave, they say,
  On a black day in spring,
  And bore him in the seventh month--
  A poor, misshapen thing.

  Kneeling down in the dark
  She travailed without a cry,
  And gave him the mothering kiss
  Between the earth and the sky.

  He licks cuckoo-spittle, they say,
  And eats the dung of the roads,
  Mocking the journeymen
  As they pass by with their loads.

  Look at his little face--
  As grey as wool is grey--
  And the cast in his green eye,
  So wild and far away.

  Does he see Magh-meala?
  Is his breath human breath?
  Are his thoughts of the hidden things
  Untouched by time and death?

  Hanging there by the half-door,
  Dangling his devil's foot,
  Stock-still on the threshold,
  As if he had taken root!




I SEE ALL LOVE IN LOWLY THINGS


  I see all love in lowly things,
  No less than in the lusts of kings:
  All beauty, shape and comeliness,
  All valour, strength and gentleness,
  All genius, wit and holiness.

  Out of corruption comes the flower,
  The corn is kindred with the clay;
  The plough-hand is a hand of power,
  Nobler than gold, brighter than day.

  Then let the leper lift his head,
  The cripple dance, the captive sing,
  The beggar reap and eat his bread--
  He is no baser than a king!




'TIS PRETTY TAE BE IN BAILE-LIOSAN


  'Tis pretty tae be in Baile-liosan,
  'Tis pretty tae be in green Magh-luan;
  'Tis prettier tae be in Newtownbreda,
  Beeking under the eaves in June.
  The cummers are out wi' their knitting and spinning,
  The thrush sings frae his crib on the wa',
  And o'er the white road the clachan caddies
  Play at their marlies and goaling-ba'.

  O, fair are the fields o' Baile-liosan,
  And fair are the faes o' green Magh-luan;
  But fairer the flowers o' Newtownbreda,
  Wet wi' dew in the eves o' June.
  'Tis pleasant tae saunter the clachan thoro'
  When day sinks mellow o'er Dubhais hill,
  And feel their fragrance sae softly breathing
  Frae croft and causey and window-sill.

  O, brave are the haughs o' Baile-liosan,
  And brave are the halds o' green Magh-luan;
  But braver the hames o' Newtownbreda,
  Twined about wi' the pinks o' June.
  And just as the face is sae kindly withouten,
  The heart within is as guid as gold--
  Wi' new fair ballants and merry music,
  And cracks cam' down frae the days of old.

  'Tis pretty tae be in Baile-liosan,
  'Tis pretty tae be in green Magh-luan;
  'Tis prettier tae be in Newtownbreda,
  Beeking under the eaves in June.
  The cummers are out wi' their knitting and spinning,
  The thrush sings frae his crib on the wa',
  And o'er the white road the clachan caddies
  Play at their marlies and goaling-ba'.




CIARAN, THE MASTER OF HORSES AND LANDS


  Ciaran, the master of horses and lands,
  Once had no more than the horn on his hands.

  But Ciaran is rich now, and Ciaran is great,
  And rides with the air of a squire of estate.

  O Christ! and to see the man up on the back
  Of a thoroughbred stallion, a bay or a black!

  There's not a horsebreeder from Banna to Laoi
  Can handle the snaffle so pretty as he!

  And Ciaran, for all, has the wit of a child,
  A heart just as soft, and an eye just as mild.

  No maker of ballads puts curse at his door:
  He handsels the singer, and harbours the poor.

  For Ciaran, the master of horses and lands,
  Once had no more than the horn on his hands.




DEEP WAYS AND DRIPPING BOUGHS


  Deep ways and dripping boughs,
  The fog falling drearily;
  Cowherds calling on their cows,
  And I crying wearily,
  Wearily, wearily, out-a-door,
  Houseless, hearthless, coatless, kindless,
  Poorest of the wandering poor.

  I am the beggar Christ--
  Christ that calmed the castling flood!
  Cross and thorn have not sufficed
  To punish me as you would;
  But out-a-door in wind and rain,
  Houseless, hearthless, coatless, kindless,
  You keep me wandering in pain.




NIGHT, AND I TRAVELLING


  Night, and I travelling.
  An open door by the wayside,
  Throwing out a shaft of warm yellow light.
  A whiff of peat-smoke;
  A gleam of delf on the dresser within;
  A woman's voice crooning, as if to a child.
  I pass on into the darkness.




NIGHT-PIECE


  Fill me, O stars,
  As with an olden tune.
  Look thro' your cloudy bars,
  O summer moon;
  Look thro', and drench in silver light
  My soul this night.

  O brief, enchanted dream
  Of sea and sky,
  Of ploughland, meadow, stream,
  And twilight loth to die,
  Of fire and dew--
  My soul is one with you!




AT MORNING TIDE


  At morning tide,
  Upon the hill of Sliabh-na-mBan,
  I saw the dead Christ glorified!
  His body, like the risen sun,
  Was all too bright to look upon:
  The blue air burned
  About him: in his side
  And hands and feet there shone
  (Thro' stabs and gashes gaping wide)
  The golden glory of his blood:
  The gilly stood
  Upon his right hand: at his feet
  The fishers, Peter, James and John,
  Knelt worshipping
  With outstretched arms, and eyes
  To heaven turned:
  And Maria, his mother sweet,
  (The partner of his mysteries),
  And Magdalen and Salome
  Came thro' the doorway of the day
  Behind him, weeping.
  . . . . Then a cloud came o'er
  My senses, and I saw and heard no more!




THE MAY-FIRE


  Come away, O Maire Ban,
  Come away, come away
  Where the heads of _ceanabhan_
  Tremble in the twilight air,
  And the rushes nod and sway,
  And no other sound is heard
  But the swaying of the rushes,
  And the shouts from Croc-an-air,
  And the singing of the fidils,
  And the laughing of the dancers
  Round about the yellow fire,
  And the scream of the water-bird.

  Come away, O life of me,
  O bone of me, O blood of me--
  Feilim has a tale to tell:
  He would own his love for thee,
  Smitten first at Mura's well,
  Bitten at the Lammas pattern,
  By the blessed Mura's well.
  He would tell thee, Maire Ban,
  How his pulses leap and thrill
  Quicker than the old men's fidils,
  Singing out from yonder hill.

  Come away, O heart's desire,
  From the ruddy-featured circle,
  From the story-telling circle,
  By the wreathing Bealtein fire.
  Come away, come away,
  Come away, O Maire Ban,
  Where the heads of _ceanabhan_
  Tremble in the twilight air,
  And the voice of love is heard
  Whispering o'er the bending rushes
  Like a hidden, holy bird.
  Come away, O Maire Ban--
  Feilim's face is fairy-wan,
  Feilim's heart is sick and pale,
  Languishing for love of thee.




I LOVE THE DIN OF BEATING DRUMS


  I love the din of beating drums,
  The bellowing pipe, the shrieking fife:
  The discord and the dissonance is my blood, my breath, my life!
  The discord and the dissonance is my life!

  Away with flutes and dancing lutes--
  Such music likes but lovers' ears:
  Give me the beating battledrum,
  The gunpeal and the cheers!
  The bellowing pipe and battledrum,
  The gunpeal and the cheers!




THREE COLTS EXERCISING IN A SIX-ACRE


  Three colts exercising in a six-acre,
  A hilly sweep of unfenced grass over the road.

  What a picture they make against the skyline!
  Necks stretched, hocks moving royally, tails flying;
  Farm-lads up, and they crouching low on their withers.

  I have a journey to go--
  A lawyer to see, and a paper to sign in the Tontine--
  But I slacken my pace to watch them.




THE NATURAL


  "Lend us the loan of a halfpenny, sir!"--
  And he passed with his splendid nose in the air.

  A gaunt, grey carcase of skin and bones,
  As cold as the river, as hard as the stones.

  To him the highway was table and bed,
  Shift for the newborn and sheet for the dead.

  The wind that blew from Beola crest
  Seemed fire to fetter his wild unrest.

  The rain that beat on his neck and face,
  A goad to quicken him in his pace.

  But sorrow a step he changed, and his prayer
  Was still--"Lend us the loan of a halfpenny, sir!"




ON THE TOP-STONE


  On the top-stone.
  A nipping wind blowing.
  Winter dusk closing in from the south Ards.
  The moon rising, white and fantastic, over the loch and the town below.
  I take off my hat, salute her, and descend into the darkness.




THE WOMEN AT THEIR DOORS


   The babes were asleep in their cradles,
   And the day's drudge was done,
   And the women brought their suppers out
   To eat them in the sun.

  "To-night I will set my needles, Aine,
   And Eoghan will have stockings to wear:
   I spun the wool of the horny ewe
   He bought at the hiring fair. . . .

  "But what is that sound I hear, Nabla?--
   It is like the cheering of men.
   God keep our kind from the devil's snare!"
   And the women answered, "Amen!"

   Then the moon rose over the valley,
   And the cheering died away,
   And the women went within their doors
   At the mouth of the summer day.

   And no men came in at midnight,
   And no men came in at the dawn,
   And the women keened by their ashy fires
   Till their faces were haggard and wan.

   For they knew they had gone to the trysting
   With pike and musketoon,
   To fight for their hearths and altars
   At the rising of the moon!




MY LITTLE DARK LOVE


  My little dark love is a wineberry,
  As swarth and as sweet, I hold;
  But as the dew on the wineberry
  Her heart is a-cold.

  I would her love were as warm as the light
  That lives in her eye of grey,
  And then my heart would know the peace
  It dreams in the hills away.

  I would her love were as red as the rose
  That blows on her cheek of brown,
  And then my sunless soul would laugh
  At the woe that weighs it down.

  She dwells in the valley, my little dark love,
  Where the river sings to the sea,
  And an ogham-stone sits by her door,
  And nigh to it hazels three.

  And oft when the purple twilight comes,
  And the blind bats flit in the air,
  I wander down from the quiet hills
  To seek my sweetheart there.

  But she comes never--she loves not me,
  Nor ever will love, I hold;
  For tho' my heart is a peat of fire,
  Her heart is a-cold!




I HEARD A PIPER PIPING


  I heard a piper piping
  The blue hills among--
  And never did I hear
  So plaintive a song.

  It seemed but a part
  Of the hills' melancholy:
  No piper living there
  Could ever be jolly!

  And still the piper piped
  The blue hills among,
  And all the birds were quiet
  To listen to his song.




THE CLOUDS GO BY AND BY


  The clouds go by and by,
  The heron sings in the blue--
  And I lie dreaming, dreaming
  Ever of you.

  The stag on the hill is free,
  And the wind is blowing sweet--
  But I lie bound a prisoner
  At your feet.




DAVY DAW


  Woa! are you there my bonny mare?
  Your whinny seems to say--
  "By Bealach forge and Creagach fair
  We'll gallop hard to-day!"
  You champ your snaffle all to foam,
  And fleck your counter bright;
  But now we bid adieu to home
  Until the fall of night.
      Davy Daw, Davy Daw, with his early horn,
      His hunting-crop and bag of corn--
      His heart's as merry as a mottle-thrush
      That sings all day in the hawthorn bush.

  Come hither, Bran of ancient seed,
  And lick your master's hand;
  I swear no dog of purer breed
  Is found in all the land.
  Brave scion of Cuchullain's branch,
  Well do you, hound, uphold
  The prowess and the courage staunch
  That marked your line of old.
      Davy Daw, Davy Daw, my merry man,
      I love toast crab in a pewter can.
      Our tastes are like as like can be--
      But a measure of ale in the can for me!

  The wind is low and scent is good,
  And Mada's on the green:
  He hid his head in Cratla Wood
  Since early yestere'en.
  You beat the bush from peep of light,
  And set the whins afire;
  And now the tory is in sight,
  You've got your heart's desire.
      Davy Daw, Davy Daw, for a crab well-browned
      In the smiling flood of a cruiscin drowned.
      Give me, sirree, my crab and ale,
      And bog or batter, my heart won't fail!

  The sun is out, and Davy's up,
  And hounds are on the run:
  It's hard he'll earn his stirrup-cup
  Before the day is done!
  A jolly life we hunters lead
  Upon the saddle high:
  We see no devil in the bead,
  And drain our noggins dry.
      Davy Daw, Davy Daw is a huntsman bold;
      He's more to me than a kingdom's gold.
      A hind for dinner and a hare to sup--
      O that's what I get when Davy's up!

  The fox is fast upon the hill,
  He's wary in the dale;
  But I will ride to Penny Mill
  Before I lose his tail.
  That brush was born to make a cap
  For gallant Eoin Og;
  And I will have it, hang-or-hap,
  As sure as I'm a rogue.
      Davy Daw, Davy Daw, for a morning chase,
      With an Irish blood to make the pace:
      He's last to check and first to view,
      And hard to the death he leads his queue.

  Day in we hunt the spinney fox,
  Day out the rapparee;
  _His_ cave is in the broken rocks
  Above the Correi-buidhe.
  A shameful thing, the ladies say,
  To hunt your fellow-man;
  But follow him till hard at bay
  It's just the ladies can!
      Davy Daw, Davy Daw, the brush is won!
      A good job, sir, our work is done.
      Whitefoot went lame this side o' the mill,
      And I'm as dry as an old lime-kiln.

  Red rogue, he'll kill his goose no more:
  Close work it was, for the light is o'er.
  Just _close_ work, sir, but the Dub's _close to_,
  With a can for me and a crab for you!




BLACK SILE OF THE SILVER EYE


  As I rode down to Gartan fair
  I met a girl upon the way:
  The winter night was on her hair,
  The summer dawn was in her eye.

  And O, she stepped with such a gait,
  And bore her round black head so high,
  And tossed it so, I knew her straight
  For Sile of the Silver Eye.

  "God save you, Sile, love," says I:
  "God save you kindly," murmured she--
  And love was welling in her eye
  As she dropped me the courtesy.

  The mountain boys upon the road
  Were at themselves for jealousy
  When they saw Seamus win the nod
  From Sile of the Silver Eye.

  We rode together to the fair,
  We danced together on the green;
  And, faith, they say a suppler pair
  Was ne'er before a piper seen.

  Black Sile of the Silver Eye
  Has been my wife for twenty year,
  And still her sloe-black head is high,
  And still her eye is silver clear.

  And, God be praised, we have a girl,
  As like her as like well can be--
  The round black head, the roguish curl,
  The soft tongue and the silver eye.

  God bless the old, God bless the new,
  And send them stout posterity--
  Old Sile and young Sile, too--
  Both "Sile of the Silver Eye!"




A SHEEPDOG BARKS ON THE MOUNTAIN


  A sheepdog barks on the mountain,
  The night is fallen cold;
  The shepherd blinks at his fire,
  The sheep are in the fold.

  The moon comes white and quiet
  Into the winter sky;
  And nothing walks the valley
  To-night but you and I.




DEAD OAKLEAVES EVERYWHERE


  Dead oakleaves everywhere
  Under my feet,
  Filling the forest air
  With odours sweet.

  Acorns, three, four and five,
  Falling apace.
  Thank God I am alive
  This day of grace!




A NIGHT PRAYER


  Pray for me, Seachnal,
  Pray for me, Mel:
  Save me from sin
  And the cold stone of hell!

  Brigid and Ita
  And Eithne the Red,
  Spread out your mantles
  And cover my bed!

  For rann and gospel
  Have gone from my mind,
  And devils are walking
  Abroad in the wind!




I AM THE MOUNTAINY SINGER


  I am the mountainy singer,
  And I would sing of the Christ
  Who followed the paths thro' the mountains
  To eat at the people's tryst.

  He loved the sun-dark people
  As the young man loves his bride,
  And he moved among their thatches,
  And for them he was crucified.

  And the people loved him, also,
  More than their houses or lands,
  For they had known his pity
  And felt the touch of his hands.

  And they dreamed with him in the mountains,
  And they walked with him on the sea,
  And they prayed with him in the garden,
  And bled with him on the tree.

  Not ever by longing and dreaming
  May they come to him now,
  But by the thorns of sorrow
  That bruised his kingly brow.




THE RAINBOW SPANNING A PLANET SHOWER


  The rainbow spanning a planet shower,
  The sloe in berry, the flax in flower.

  The scholar's satchel, the beggar's staff,
  The ploughman's whistle, the tinker's laugh.

  The stranded hooker, the breaking wave,
  The sunrise gilding the carn of Medb.

  The strength of mountains, the swiftness of wind
  Blowing over the leagues behind.

  The hot lips sealing the spoken word,
  The song in gentle places heard.

  The wildgoose trumpeting in the blue,
  The postcar stuck in a drift of snow.

  The bogslide moving, the seaward leap,
  The cry, the townland whelmed in sleep.

  The sock on the anvil, the thread in the loom,
  The Host on the altar, the child in the womb.

  The wayside murder, the whispered name,
  The hanging body, the hidden shame.

  And more--if you but listen and look--
  In this, my elemental book!




I WILL GO WITH MY FATHER A-PLOUGHING


  I will go with my father a-ploughing
  To the green field by the sea,
  And the rooks and the crows and the seagulls
  Will come flocking after me.
  I will sing to the patient horses
  With the lark in the white of the air,
  And my father will sing the plough-song
  That blesses the cleaving share.

  I will go with my father a-sowing
  To the red field by the sea,
  And the rooks and the gulls and the starlings
  Will come flocking after me.
  I will sing to the striding sowers
  With the finch on the greening sloe,
  And my father will sing the seed-song
  That only the wise men know.

  I will go with my father a-reaping
  To the brown field by the sea,
  And the geese and the crows and the children
  Will come flocking after me.
  I will sing to the tanfaced reapers
  With the wren in the heat of the sun,
  And my father will sing the scythe-song
  That joys for the harvest done.




THE SHINING SPACES OF THE SOUTH


  The shining spaces of the south,
  The circle of the year, the sea,
  The blowing rose, the maiden's mouth,
  The love, the hate, the ecstasy,
  The golden wood, the shadowed stream,
  The dew, the light, the wind, the rain,
  The man's desire, the woman's dream,
  The bed embrace, the childing pain,
  The sound of music heard afar,
  The breathing grass, the broken sod,
  The sun, the moon, the twilight star--
  Do all proclaim the mind of God.
  Then why should I, who am but clay,
  Think otherwise, or answer nay?




LIKE A TUFT OF CEANABHAN


  Like a tuft of _ceanabhan_
  Blowing in the wind
  Is my slender Aine Ban--
  White and soft and kind.

  Kind her heart is, but her clann's
  Cold as clay or stone.
  Would that I had herds and lands
  To take her for my own!




THE HERB-LEECH


  I have gathered _luss_
  At the wane of the moon,
  And supped its sap
  With a yewen spoon.
  I have sat a spell
  By the carn of Medb,
  And smelt the mould
  Of the red queen's grave.
  I have dreamed a dearth
  In the darkened sun,
  And felt the hand
  Of the Evil One.
  I have fathomed war
  In the comet's tail,
  And heard the crying
  Of Gall and Gael.
  I have seen the spume
  On the dead priest's lips,
  And the "holy fire"
  On the spars of ships;
  And the shooting stars
  On Barthelmy's Night,
  Blanching the dark
  With ghostly light;
  And the corpse-candle
  Of the seer's dream,
  Bigger in girth
  Than a weaver's beam;
  And the shy hearth-fairies
  About the grate,
  Blowing the turves
  To a whiter heat.
  All things on earth
  To me are known,
  For I have the gift
  Of the Murrain Stone!




WHO BUYS LAND


  Who buys land buys many stones,
  Who buys flesh buys many bones;
  Who buys eggs buys many shells,
  Who buys love buys nothing else.

  Love is a burr upon the floor,
  Love is a thief behind the door;
  Who loves leman for her breath
  May quench his fire and cry for death!

  Love is a bridle, love is a load,
  Love is a thorn upon the road;
  Love is the fly that flits its hour,
  Love is the shining venom-flower.

  Love is a net, love is a snare,
  Love is a bubble blown with air;
  Love starts hot, and waning cold,
  Is withered in the grave's mould!




THE POET LOOSED A WINGÈD SONG


  The poet loosed a wingèd song
  Against the hulk of England's wrong.
  Were poisoned words at his command,
  'Twould not avail for Ireland.

  The soldier lifted up a sword,
  And on the hills in battle poured
  His life-blood like an ebbing sea--
  And still we pine for liberty.

  The friar spoke his bitter hope,
  And danced upon the gallows rope.
  Were he to dance that dance again
  A hundred times, 'twould be in vain.

  Christ save us! only thou canst save!
  The nation staggers to the grave.
  Can genius, valour, faith be given,
  And win no recompense of heaven?

  No, Christ! by Ireland's martyrs, no!
  'Twas not for this we suffered so.
  Die, die again on Calvary tree,
  If needs be, Christ, to set us free!
                To set us free!




SIC TRANSIT


  I lit my tallow
  An hour ago,
  And now it is burning
  Dark and low.

  The glimmer lengthens
  And turns about,
  Sinks in the sconce--
  Then flickers out!
