the
harp
of
the

argument
of
the
poem
from
the
moment
of
my
earliest
acquaintance
with
colonial
history
i
have
felt
all
the
pressure
of
a
task
laid
upon
me
tightening
its
grasp
as
i
reached
maturer
years
that
of
an
attempt
to
rescue
the
aztecs
from
their
letterless
and
mythical
position
in
history
to
the
position
which
their
possibilities
at
least
argue
for
them
and
this
feeling
has
been
far
less
the
outgrowth
of
the
enthusiasm
awakened
for
the
aztecs
as
the
indignation
felt
at
the
whole
conduct
of
the
spanish
conquest
realizing
the
gravity
of
the
task
i
have
been
led
to
carefully
weigh
and
investigate
the
different
theories
advanced
as
to
the
origin
of
the
aztecs
and
to
adopt
the
argument
of
the
poem
as
the
best
ground
on
which
to
unite
the
sun
worship
of
the
east
with
the
mythology
of
of
the
west
reverently
and
with
a
full
realization
of
how
great
must
ever
be
the
distance
between
the
actual
work
and
the
ideal
of
my
early
inspiration
i
lay
the
gathered
chaplet
at
the
shrine
of
old
chapultepec
and
only
regret
that
the
fruiting
should
have
fallen
so
far
short
of
the
promise
of
its
blooming
to
hubert
howe
bancroft
the
living
and
prescott
the
dead
differing
as
they
do
in
some
very
material
respects
yet
essentially
the
same
in
spirit
i
wish
to
record
my
indebtedness
for
their
admirable
and
exhaustive
works
that
have
induced
to
a
final
effort
the
poem
of
which
this
is
prefatory
some
years
since
i
found
in
an
abridged
history
of
the
united
states
a
brief
outline
that
led
me
back
to
the
dispersal
at
shinar
certainly
a
safe
location
for
a
speculative
beginning
for
the
origin
of
the
aztec
race
it
occurs
to
me
now
with
a
shade
of
the
ludicrous
that
if
safety
were
the
thing
in
the
premises
i
might
have
gone
back
a
step
farther
to
the
figs
and
pomegranites
of
eden
and
prayed
for
the
shade
of
adam
to
cover
the
exotic
which
i
have
humbly
tried
to
rescue
from
what
seems
to
me
to
be
an
undeserved
obscurity
the
careful
analogies
drawn
between
egypt
and
the
aztecs
by
both
prescott
and
bancroft
could
be
better
met
by
locating
the
origin
at
shinar
than
at
any
other
point
as
it
takes
us
back
to
a
date
where
we
may
consistently
locate
the
shepherd
kings
and
the
overrunning
of
mizraim
by
them
a
part
of
early
history
which
is
outlined
more
or
less
briefly
by
nearly
all
early
historians
as
to
the
initial
period
of
sun
worship
and
its
origin
i
could
of
necessity
have
but
little
aid
and
if
i
have
seemed
a
little
too
speculative
i
have
only
this
apology
the
prodigy
of
prehistoric
development
and
the
manufacture
of
glass
antedating
historic
research
it
needs
no
great
imaginative
tension
to
crown
some
incipient
philosopher
not
only
with
the
discovery
of
glass
but
that
in
its
proper
shape
it
could
be
made
to
concentrate
the
solar
rays
and
produce
fire
and
at
that
day
and
age
what
possible
superstitions
might
result
from
these
discoveries
after
the
of
the
mizraim
descent
and
the
consequent
expulsion
of
the
sons
of
lud
the
line
of
their
journey
is
the
natural
outgrowth
of
their
religious
fanaticism
they
know
that
india
and
the
far
east
are
inhabited
and
they
seek
the
uninhabited
track
for
their
exit
the
mound
builders
seem
to
be
historic
cousins
of
the
aztecs
certainly
the
superiors
of
the
aborigines
of
the
north
and
middle
atlantic
the
expulsion
of
the
mound
builders
will
admit
of
many
theories
and
i
have
simply
adopted
the
one
that
occurred
to
me
as
consistent
with
the
christian
inspiration
of
all
great
events
the
settlement
of
mexico
by
the
aztecs
as
a
branch
of
the
mound
builders
follows
naturally
in
the
wake
of
previous
events
and
the
chain
is
thus
made
complete
with
no
serious
hazard
to
its
consistency
as
merely
speculative
drama
leading
up
to
what
is
plainly
historical
i
have
striven
to
be
historically
consistent
following
the
letter
of
events
closely
taking
conjectural
ground
in
but
few
instances
if
i
have
seemed
to
be
censorious
even
to
rancor
at
times
i
have
only
given
vent
to
the
repressed
indignation
of
prescott
and
other
authors
on
the
subject
of
the
spanish
conquest
the
only
possible
justification
for
the
excesses
of
cortez
and
his
adherents
is
the
age
in
which
the
conquest
took
place
and
those
who
seek
to
justify
it
in
this
way
point
to
the
opening
of
the
present
century
and
to
napoleon
decoying
the
imbecile
king
and
the
weak
asturias
into
abdication
and
banishment
to
make
room
for
his
brother
joseph
this
is
a
upon
the
present
century
and
though
a
plain
case
of
retributive
justice
through
the
visiting
of
the
sins
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
still
the
fact
remains
that
the
attempt
to
bring
of
any
multiple
of
wrongs
must
always
record
a
failure
a
sufficient
answer
to
the
latitude
of
the
age
is
the
fact
that
a
corresponding
age
gave
us
plymouth
and
not
long
after
penn
colony
nor
can
the
spaniards
claim
the
same
justification
for
excesses
as
these
coincident
colonists
all
of
whom
had
felt
the
lash
of
religious
intolerance
the
spanish
conquest
antedating
the
divisions
that
followed
the
reformation
has
no
such
covert
for
their
lustful
excrescences
any
system
of
religious
ethics
that
severs
human
responsibility
from
the
domain
of
conscience
and
furnishes
a
market
for
the
indulgences
that
cover
all
the
excesses
of
the
body
politic
can
not
be
expected
to
bring
forth
the
best
of
fruit
from
a
bloom
so
blighted
by
human
lust
and
so
blackened
by
human
selfishness
if
amid
all
of
their
intolerance
and
deceit
they
had
respected
the
homely
records
and
the
grotesque
landmarks
of
the
nation
they
destroyed
the
cavaliers
might
have
shown
them
as
a
slight
palliation
and
at
once
furnished
the
historian
the
shadow
of
justification
for
their
abuses
but
the
mental
caste
that
could
adopt
any
and
every
device
of
deception
and
treachery
to
accomplish
its
ends
threw
itself
at
once
into
the
arms
of
a
priestcraft
if
possible
more
implacable
than
themselves
and
obedient
to
their
demands
tore
down
their
landmarks
and
ground
their
records
to
powder
surely
there
is
no
fanaticism
like
religious
fanaticism
and
no
licentiousness
like
that
of
the
unbridled
devotee
of
the
church
finally
as
a
whole
i
feel
confident
that
my
effort
will
not
fail
to
create
food
for
thought
and
eventually
justify
the
effort
which
called
it
forth
to
a
nature
partially
huguenot
in
its
origin
and
more
so
in
sympathy
and
inclination
i
have
tried
to
add
the
temperate
element
that
would
impart
freedom
from
undue
prejudice
and
passion
but
as
the
work
is
of
necessity
vindicatory
on
the
one
hand
and
repressive
on
the
other
i
have
been
compelled
to
use
good
plain
saxon
words
in
the
closing
pages
justified
only
by
the
verity
of
their
signification
the
body
of
the
work
is
given
in
decimeters
varying
in
only
a
few
cases
where
the
expression
seemed
to
require
a
different
form
i
would
rather
not
close
these
already
extended
remarks
without
recording
my
testimony
with
that
of
others
of
the
positive
pleasure
experienced
both
in
the
progress
and
completion
of
a
work
of
this
character
and
if
i
shall
have
been
as
fortunate
in
securing
and
retaining
an
auditory
i
shall
be
twice
blessed
for
our
highest
ambition
should
ever
be
that
of
contributing
to
the
happiness
of
others
the
reward
of
earnest
labor
conscientiously
performed
is
the
prize
only
exceeded
in
the
economy
of
things
and
that
beyond
the
ken
of
our
divulgence
yet
may
we
not
hope
that
there
is
no
actual
severance
between
the
earthly
type
and
the
heavenly
reality
that
the
crown
honestly
won
and
the
prize
worthily
gained
on

that
the

voice
should
leave
no

echo
for
the
ear
so
tokened

heaven
to
them
was
but
a
brilliant
canopy

a
sort
of
diadem
just
out

and
they
could
see
no

they
might
not

their
foolish

supposed
this
little
caprice
of

hour
through
all
the
after
age
would
witness
of

vigilantly
on

as
they
neared
the
upper
ether
silent
as

tools

closed
forevermore
their
mutual
labor

in

they

may
sing
as
his
responsive

all
echo
with
the
first
which
shows
how
deep
are
all
of
our
desires
how
earnestly
we
peer
out
in
the
dark
how
are
we
freighted
all
with
latent
fires
how
on
our
souls
and
in
our
hearts
the
master
leaves
his
mark
there
rose
from
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
one
bowed
with
lengthened
years
yet
nobly
bent
with
the
more
potent
weight
of
earnest
thought
his
massive
brain
and
princely
bearing
lent
a
more
than
common
strength
to
his
clear
eye
as
on
his
shepherd
staff
his
form
was
bent
near
to
the
king
with
faltering
step
he
came
and
spake
as
if
a
master
spake
with
all
his
soul
aflame
oh
king
and
sons
of
lud
no
pardon
asks
old
kohen
for
the
words
that
leap
his
lips
no
earthly
throne
gives
warrant
to
my
voice
but
he
the
god
of
whom
our
fathers
told
the
god
of
noah
he
at
whose
command
the
patriarch
bent
to
labor
and
till
twice
a
hundred
harvest
moons
had
waned
wrought
on
the
ark
and
saved
the
seed
of
man
to
earth
he
he
has
spoken
and
his
words
have
sunk
so
deeply
in
my
heart
i
must
be
thus
saith
the
lord
truant
sons
of
lud
why
grope
ye
in
the
dark
why
not
return
to
the
great
father
house
how
have
i
called
and
waited
for
an
answer
to
my
suit
o
sons
of
men
return
repent
believe
where
have
ye
wandered
that
ye
have
not
heard
the
voice
of
your
jehovah
in
the
wind
and
on
the
storm
and
tempest
when
in
wrath
he
thunders
in
the
ears
of
men
repent
and
on
the
desert
in
the
hot
simoom
writ
fervent
words
to
warn
you
of
your
way
am
the
god
of
whom
your
fathers
spake
out
of
all
chaos
did
i
call
the
earth
and
out
of
dust
your
great
ancestor
made
and
hardly
his
clay
swaddlings
put
on
ere
from
his
rib
i
called
his
helpmeet
forth
mother
eve
i
have
bespoken
wrath
yet
on
the
threshold
of
your
life
i
placed
the
ministry
of
love
and
with
my
lips
i
kissed
the
clay
to
life
how
have
i
longed
to
hold
the
race
as
i
their
fathers
held
encircled
in
the
everlasting
arms
but
ye
would
not
ye
are
yourselves
a
law
to
your
own
beings
in
my
image
made
and
ye
must
choose
to
live
to
love
to
learn
how
great
is
my
compassion
and
how
long
i
have
kept
watch
and
waited
for
my
lost
very
anger
is
the
throne
of
because
i
could
not
lose
the
multitudes
the
myriads
of
millions
yet
unborn
i
spoke
your
father
noah
into
work
and
set
afloat
the
remnant
of
his
loins
and
oped
the
gates
of
heaven
to
flood
the
earth
i
saw
the
race
go
down
to
watery
graves
in
sorrow
and
i
saw
a
deeper
wound
had
i
but
spared
i
struck
the
seedling
off
rather
than
smite
the
tree
i
move
in
storms
to
purify
and
in
the
tempest
smite
only
to
save
i
saw
the
impious
hands
your
fathers
raised
in
shinar
and
i
came
and
in
the
night
gave
each
another
tongue
and
scattered
their
device
and
smote
their
lips
that
they
raised
not
to
mine
how
could
i
see
their
folly
and
not
smite
i
loved
them
so
ye
who
have
children
look
within
your
hearts
and
in
them
see
the
miniatures
of
mine
more
of
the
parent
than
your
soul
can
feel
in
me
the
source
and
spring
of
love
i
followed
with
paternal
care
to
ind
i
saw
and
i
stood
guard
upon
your
steps
more
than
a
father
love
was
in
my
soul
more
than
a
mother
tenderness
inurned
the
mountains
are
the
of
my
strength
yet
am
i
weak
in
love
i
would
not
send
one
single
child
to
the
eternal
world
all
unprepared
but
ye
have
gone
astray
ye
are
my
flock
and
i
would
turn
you
back
before
the
wolves
shall
fatten
of
your
flesh
offerings
from
your
herds
the
choicest
bring
are
they
not
also
mine
and
altars
build
and
offer
them
thereon
but
further
bring
the
contrite
heart
and
the
unsullied
hand
bring
as
your
fathers
told
you
abel
brought
and
i
will
meet
you
on
the
altar
brink
with
fire
from
heaven
and
consume
it
all
ask
not
again
to
look
upon
my
face
ye
can
not
look
and
live
i
only
speak
as
i
now
speak
through
kohen
he
it
is
out
from
among
you
i
have
set
apart
be
my
sponsor
listen
to
my
words
build
up
your
altars
offer
from
your
best
am
i
not
better
than
the
best
you
have
when
ye
have
builded
pray
pour
out
your
hearts
as
ye
pour
out
the
blood
prayer
is
the
key
to
my
most
inner
soul
the
voice
of
love
is
prayer
it
is
the
angel
wing
that
fell
never
yet
short
of
paradise
the
voice
that
trembles
on
the
lips
of
infancy
when
reaching
out
to
reason
and
the
last
that
passes
with
the
shadow
of
the
sun
when
life
last
slope
is
reached
and
never
yet
has
the
repentant
spirit
left
unalmsed
ye
not
heard
how
enoch
walked
with
god
and
he
was
not
because
i
drew
him
up
he
kept
so
closely
locked
in
my
embrace
that
there
was
nothing
left
of
him
to
die
so
would
i
have
you
walk
and
learn
the
way
for
i
am
very
near
each
human
soul
and
ye
may
blend
your
being
into
mine
and
losing
self
be
only
found
of
me
ye
all
through
adam
sinned
but
there
will
come
a
time
when
in
the
second
adam
will
the
first
transgression
be
atoned
your
altars
then
may
all
be
turned
to
ashes
for
i
send
my
best
beloved
my
ever
blessed
son
the
prince
of
peace
to
save
the
earth
the
first
great
offense
and
to
prepare
the
creature
for
creation
judgment
day
himself
upon
the
altar
will
be
placed
a
final
offering
for
the
sins
of
men
is
our
justice
smothered
with
love
the
law
is
satisfied
when
love
made
king
bends
down
the
neck
to
bear
the
ills
of
earth
therefore
return
and
i
will
warm
you
back
to
perfect
life
if
you
but
follow
me
come
in
and
rest
i
am
your
husbandman
and

in
me
o
children

am
your
shepherd
and
my
arms
shall
bear
the
weak
ones
of
the
flock
do
any
thirst
i
am
your
spring
your
parched
lips
to
cool
come
and
be
one
with
me
and
i
will
be
more
than
your
souls
could
ever
frame
to
ask
come
to
my
open
arms
o
sons
of
men
they
are
not
full
without
you
in
my
heart
is
loneliness
though
from
itself
it
draw
companionship
had
i
but
called
to
life
the
pliant
clay
of
adam
and
not
breathed
my
spirit
in
his
nostrils
then
could
he
out
his
measure
with
a
lesser
life
without
the
test
of
law
but
how
much
more
to
live
as
he
could
lived
divinely
great
in
mastery
of
earth
and
only
on
the
single
test
obedience
to
our
will
yet
he
fell
short
and
i
foresaw
it
all
and
suffered
it
that
human
eyes
might
see
the
glories
of
redemption
and
behold
the
one
incarnate
son
the
soul
of
love
the
second
self
of
me
sons
of
men
fall
down
behold
his
coming
in
a
glass
behold
and
see
him
in
the
fire
i
send
from
heaven
upon
your
altars
and
repent
and
when
the
time
is
fully
ripe
behold
he
cometh
in
the
flesh
and
ye
shall
see
the
very
son
and
sanction
of
my
heart
oh
is
it
not
enough
can
even
i
do
more
your
children
shall
behold
my
words
grown
to
fulfillment
and
they
all
shall
see
the
son
of
god
become
the
son
of
man
and
ye
may
see
by
faith
if
ye
implant
the
tree
of
your
redemption
so
its
leaves
may
cover
egypt
and
the
rest
of
earth
pestilence
that
darkens
at
your
door
came
as
a
cry
from
mizraim
in
bonds
off
his
chains
and
i
will
lift
you
up
love
ye
your
neighbor
as
ye
love
yourselves
his
bruises
and
your
pestilence
shall
pass
together
from
the
land
live
ye
pure
lives
and
all
your
blackness
shall
become
as
snow
make
room
for
me
among
you
in
the
morn
let
rise
your
incense
to
the
throne
of
grace
bring
me
your
noon
oblation
in
your
thanks
let
evening
have
its
holicaust
of
love
when
spring
puts
forth
her
promise
offer
up
when
summer
comes
enladen
with
its
growth
and
when
the
harvest
moon
with
ripened
sheaves
measures
the
fullness
of
my
great
regard
yea
when
the
winter
brings
the
time
of
rest
but
pour
into
each
crevice
of
the
well
filled
year
the
overflow
of
all
your
thankfulness
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
your
lives
and
in
the
yellow
leaves
of
autumn
come
and
in
the
snow
and
winter
of
your
age
come
any
time
but
come
stay
not
away
and
i
will
give
you
rest
and
ye
shall
not
go
out
again
forever
but
shall
shine
bright
as
the
brightest
stars
and
ye
shall
sing
as
never
angels
sang
and
every
soul
be
swallowed
up
in
sunshine
evermore
he
ceased
and
there
arose
from
out
the
crowd
the
murmuring
voice
of
question
on
the
air
some
thought
him
moved
of
god
and
long
and
loud
gave
acclamation
in
his
favor
where
cried
they
can
such
authority
be
found
whence
come
those
gracious
words
if
not
from
god
power
wisdom
love
entripled
in
the
sound
a
mother
tenderness
a
father
rod
then
spake
the
unctious
king
and
through
the
king
the
man
for
he
was
but
a
tattered
rag
of
royalty
what
is
this
wondrous
thing
old
kohen
you
propose
make
haste
let
lag
your
purpose
why
is
it
we
can
not
speak
face
unto
face
with
your
great
deity
our
fathers
say
old
noah
did
what
leak
has
sprung
between
us
that
we
can
not
see
the
father
as
he
is
as
others
did
am
i
not
greater
than
all
earthly
kings
he
spake
our
fathers
wherefore
is
he
hid
that
i
can
not
behold
him
let
his
wings
be
folded
for
a
while
as
he
comes
down
that
we
may
see
him
as
he
is
we
came
to
choose
a
god
whom
we
indeed
can
see
or
if
his
face
be
burnished
with
a
flame
too
great
for
our
uncovered
eyes
then
we
are
satisfied
to
close
them
in
the
smile
of
one
so
radiant
so
we
feel
him
near
but
we
must
know
his
presence
for
the
while
speak
kohen
why
can
ye
not
bring
him
here
then
answered
kohen
urge
me
not
o
king
ye
know
not
what
ye
ask
if
ye
do
seek
to
see
him
as
he
is
a
nameless
thing
a
man
upon
whose
cheek
sheds
everyday
god
sunshine
shall
he
ask
that
a
decree
be
broken
and
presume
to
lift
unhallowed
voice
though
in
a
mask
jehovah
hides
his
presence
yet
the
bloom
of
every
flower
is
but
the
blush
he
brings
upon
the
face
of
nature
as
he
looks
abroad
upon
his
creatures
and
she
sings
from
her
ten
thousand
voices
in
his
praise
wake
to
his
chorus
of
the
days
wake
children
and
your
faith
shall
blossom
into
wings
prate
ye
to
fools
the
incensed
monarch
cries
nor
gabble
longer
of
your
hidden
lord
who
follows
in
his
wake
this
moment
dies
and
isis
and
eternal
keep
my
word
we
have
a
score
of
hidden
deities
and
yet
they
leave
us
without
aid
or
thought
and
pestilence
comes
in
and
blocks
our
ways
and
where
can
our
deliverance
be
bought
show
the
bare
hand
of
infinite
decree
show
us
a
present
help
in
each
distress
show
us
the
master
we
will
bend
the
knee
and
we
will
follow
on
in
righteousness
strike
strike
the
chords
while
we
invoke
the
gods
and
with
the
music
let
our
souls
be
blended
that
we
may
find
the
one
before
whom
nods
stripling
deities
and
thus
our
strife
be
ended
then
rose
a
blast
of
sound
upon
the
air
and
blended
with
it
was
the
voice
of
song
the
chime
of
music
with
the
moan
of
prayer
a
nation
thirst
deep
earnest
and
impassionately
strong
o
god
of
gods
be
with
us
when
we
pray
and
give
us
rest
list
our
entreaty
be
not
far
away
be
near
each
breast
the
gods
of
mizraim
we
have
sought
in
vain
they
answer
not
our
prayers
are
but
an
empty
aching
pain
we
are
forgot
though
isis
bless
our
fields
and
flocks
with
growth
and
thoth
be
heard
upon
the
tongues
of
wisemen
yet
is
wroth
some
mighty
lord
some
hidden
power
without
us
in
the
dark
we
grope
our
way
from
thine
own
glory
lend
to
us
a
spark
be
thou
our
day
o
make
thee
to
be
known
from
thy
unchanging
throne
god
of
the
trusting
heart
come
take
us
by
the
hand
and
be
our
sole
command
and
form
with
us
a
part
give
us
to
look
upon
thy
form
without
a
frown
our
doubts
and
fears
displace
god
of
the
universe

from
us
thy
curse
give
us
to

thy
face
behold
behold
his
face
a
hand
is
pointed
to
the
sun
behold
and
be
ye
not
afraid
be
life
once
more
begun
look
ye
upon
his
face
and
learn
to
live
look
ye
upon
his
face
and
learn
to
die
his
hand
alone
deliverance
can
give
his
light
alone
can
frame
the
soul
reply
me
ye
sons
of
men
all
eyes
were
turned
a
stranger
in
their
midst
whose
dark
eye
burned
with
an
unearthly
gleam
yet
black
as
night
it
had
no
heavenly
radiance
yet
was
bright
with
a
mysterious
blaze
that
pierced
the
soul
as
with
an
arrow
to
its
inmost
part
his
form
in
keeping
with
his
face
made
whole
a
man
well
fitted
to
command
a
heart
that
seemed
to
throb
with
some
great
passion
pent
and
seething
into
purpose
his
black
face
shone
like
a
of
his
design
his
words
and
his
strange
presence
in
the
place
gave
him
enraptured
audience
that
no
one
dared
decline
hear
me
ye
sons
of
men
i
am
not
come
to
woe
ye
to
destruction
but
to
save
the
color
of
my
face
betrays
my
birth
i
am
mizraim
race
but
of
mankind
a
brother
and
i
speak
in
soberness
because
our
fathers
wandered
from
the
way
and
left
the
shining
pathway
of
the
sun
because
they
fell
to
seeking
other
gods
he
suffered
them
to
fall
into
your
hands
i
will
not
speak
as
he
has
feigned
to
speak
who
claimed
before
me
sponsorship
from
god
but
i
will
make
it
plain
that
he
deceived
our
fathers
tell
of
noah
and
the
ark
and
also
tell
of
shinar
and
the
time
of
the
dispersal
it
is
not
enough
to
come
with
empty
declamation
come
with
platitudes
of
love
and
softened
terms
of
parenthood
and
then
to
dash
it
all
the
yearning
love
of
children
to
the
earth
by
words
that
are
icicled
up
from
death
not
to
look
upon
my
face
again
ye
can
not
look
and
live
shame
shame
on
the
pretender
thus
to
bring
your
expectations
to
the
pitch
of
pain
the
summit
of
your
hope
where
to
move
on
is
only
to
descent
and
sorrow
thus
to
multiply
his
attributes
of
good
and
to
describe
a
god
so
like
the
true
the
ever
shining
sun
and
then
deny
the
precious
boon
of
sight
what
mockery
when
there
he
stands
eternity
as
young
the
broad
full
shining
orb
to
look
upon
the
ever
radiant
arbiter
of
earth
the
great
am
of
love
the
very
soul
of
tenderness
rising
every
morn
to
kiss
his
sleeping
children
from
their
beds
enwrapping
them
with
all
his
piercing
warmth
wooing
the
fragrant
flowers
from
the
earth
and
warming
all
existences
to
life
how
can
the
soul
be
blind
when
such
a
pledge
stands
in
eternal
witness
of
its
love
the
very
rocks
would
break
their
raptured
trance
if
man
find
not
his
voice
in
fervent
praise
how
do
the
waters
mirror
up
his
face
and
tremble
into
waves
at
his
advance
the
universe
goes
laughing
into
life
each
morn
at
his
approach
and
all
the
world
forgets
its
wakefulness
when
the
tired
wing
of
day
is
folded
and
himself
withdraws
to
teach
us
faith
in
him
till
he
return
thus
every
night
his
promise
and
each
morn
his
gracious
fulfillment
filling
the
year
with
ripened
sheaves
of
his
remembrances
we
measure
power
by
our
necessities
let
him
forget
the
dawning
of
one
day
or
leave
us
through
the
circle
of
one
moon
which
were
the
same
to
him
but
for
his
love
by
what
conception
would
we
feel
our
loss
while
yet
the
year
is
young
we
scatter
seed
and
wait
his
fervid
rays
to
fructify
the
trees
put
forth
their
bloom
that
his
embrace
may
ripen
into
fruit
and
not
a
growth
but
climbs
his
rays
to
full
development
when
nature
points
with
her
ten
thousand
hands
to
him
the
almighty
framer
of
it
all
shall
man
forget
his
duty
and
fly
off
on
the
unnumbered
tangents
of
the
brain
rather
let
break
our
voices
in
his
praise
and
let
each
human
soul
be
safely
borne
back
to
his
paradise
down
on
his
rays
man
rode
into
the
world
and
if
we
wander
not
the
same
broad
path
is
open
for
our
exit
there
is
room
in
his
broad
campus
for
the
royal
race
our
bodies
are
of
dust
and
will
return
only
the
vital
spark
the
shining
way
ere
traversed
and
that
alone
goes
back
to
join
the
maker
in
the
increate
the
golden
chambers
of
eternal
light
look
on
these
eyes
have
they
not
more
than
earth
in
their
deep
glance
i
know
whereof
i
speak
for
i
was
led
in
trancehood
to
the
sun
and
in
his
very
chambers
have
i
walked
and
at
his
very
throne
have
i
bent
down
to
praise
him
multitudes
were
there
who
knelt
as
i
did
kneel
in
rapturehood
and
prayer
high
in
the
midst
sole
source
of
life
and
light
the
glowing
center
of
the
shining
orb
sat
the
unchanging
god
his
face
was
that
of
manhood
magnified
upon
his
cheek
was
more
than
woman
beauty
deified
o
once
to
look
and
live
is
all
the
soul
though
it
be
triply
strengthened
can
endure
till
it
do
pass
from
this
clay
tenement
into
the
morrow
of
the
upper
world
but
we
may
now
and
always
climb
the
rays
that
spring
from
his
own
countenance
and
see
the
reflex
of
his
face
but
of
his
form
but
little
can
be
printed
on
our
sight
enough
to
know
he
lives
and
is
our
life
and
every
morning
he
doth
search
us
out
and
lift
the
burden
from
our
heavy
lids
that
we
may
rise
with
him
and
to
our
tasks
shall
we
be
hushed
when
every
bird
and
flower
doth
herald
his
approach
convolvulus
waits
for
his
coming
with
its
lips
apart
and
philomela
will
not
close
his
note
till
he
do
answer
with
his
smiling
face
thus
the
whole
earth
resolvent
into
song
waits
for
his
footsteps
how
can
we
be
dumb
there
was
a
song
which
flowed
untutored
from
the
lips
of
love
the
ransomed
ones
that
knelt
before
his
throne
no
earthly
tongues
its
echo
could
repeat
so
much
there
was
of
love
so
much
of
joy
so
much
of
tenderness
and
innocence
for
they
were
without
guile
and
not
a
word
but
breathed
of
faith
dependency
and
peace
it
praised
him
for
his
sufference
of
earth
that
he
did
bear
its
sin
yet
did
not
smite
and
only
once
in
anger
hid
his
face
and
oped
the
heavens
to
wash
out
its
filth
yet
with
his
fervent
rays
drank
up
the
flood
and
set
his
bow
a
witness
that
again
never
should
earth
be
flooded
while
the
years
melt
into
centuries
till
the
whole
race
with
aching
hearts
and
scalding
eyes
shall
come
back
to
his
fatherhood
they
thanked
him
for
his
of
man
that
time
and
time
his
face
was
partly
hid
to
show
the
hazard
of
our
wandering
steps
that
in
the
early
and
the
latter
rain
he
wept
for
our
refreshment
till
his
tears
shut
out
his
fervent
glances
from
our
eyes
and
though
he
mourned
our
strangerhood
of
him
yet
would
he
teach
us
that
in
smiles
and
tears
are
we
begotten
and
our
lives
are
lost
if
we
find
not
the
blessings
that
are
hid
beneath
the
rainbow
tints
of
sorrowing
thus
much
and
more
that
i
will
not
essay
but
i
was
led
through
fields
and
garden
walks
and
ornate
grandeur
which
the
earth
affords
nor
pattern
nor
approach
and
though
the
mind
be
forced
to
utmost
tension
it
can
not
encompass
the
bewilderment
of
sight
since
my
return
i
can
not
cast
it
off
it
lingers
with
me
like
some
raptured
dream
and
in
my
eyes
and
on
my
face
is
drawn
the
print
of
its
unspeakable
surmount
and
i
would
call
it
dream
if
i
had
not
a
talisman
that
tells
me
of
its
truth
an
angel
led
me
to
the
central
throne
an
angel
led
me
back
to
consciousness
but
ere
he
passed
the
confines
of
the
sun
he
handed
me
a
clear
transparent
gem
and
called
me
thus
it
shall
be
said
the
very
god
commands
that
it
be
done
my
light
my
fire
upon
the
earth
shall
build
again
my
altars
and
restore
with
his
own
hand
the
priesthood
of
the
sun
i
will
a
hundredfold
return
the
scorn
of
mizraim
on
himself
for
his
neglect
and
from
the
sons
of
lud
i
will
raise
up
a
kingdom
that
shall
shine
in
righteousness
this
said
he
handed
me
the
talisman
which
when
our
altars
shall
have
been
prepared
and
laden
with
the
choicest
of
our
flock
shall
claim
the
pledge
of
the
eternal
one
with
fire
from
his
own
courts
to
burn
it
up
i
can
not
say
how
long
or
short
a
time
i
lingered
thus
entranced
i
only
know
i
waked
to
find
it
real
the
precious
gem
is
proof
of
disenchantment
it
is
here
i
lay
no
claim
on
priesthood
but
have
told
the
plain
uncumbered
truth
when
i
did
fall
prone
to
the
earth
in
trance
i
had
no
thought
of
what
would
come
of
it
you
have
it
all
i
have
the
stone
and
we
will
test
its
power
if
yonder
priest
with
his
enshrouded
myth
desires
to
measure
lances
with
the
sun
then
we
will
each
build
altars
to
our
gods
and
he
that
first
draws
fire
from
any
source
not
of
the
earth
shall
claim
the
forfeiture
of
all
the
other
tenantry
to
teach
i
may
have
said
too
much
i
can
not
more
than
leave
the
rest
with
god
the
changeless
one
the
bright
universe
of
love
the
unfailing
source
the
broad
unvarying
stream
the
very
oceanhood
of
deity
he
ceased
and
kohen
rising
to
his
feet
gave
back
the
challenge
eagerly
as
might
the
athlete
spring
his
ready
foe
to
meet
his
was
the
conscious
power
of
fearless
right
let
him
lift
up
his
altars
to
the
sun
and
i
will
call
upon
the
uncreate
the
hand
that
shaped
it
from
chaotic
void
the
face
whose
look
first
taught
it
how
to
smile
he
may
call
first
that
it
may
vantage
him
but
other
than
the
earth
can
no
man
bring
fire
from
the
distant
realms
except
it
be
from
god
creator
of
the
sun
the
moon
and
stars
i
am
content
that
he
do
cry
his
god
till
he
be
hoarse
with
hardihood
of
prayer
this
day
shall
judge
between
us
and
the
right
and
ye
shall
see
the
bare
arm
of
the
lord
the
crowd
impatient
of
his
words
did
shout
in
uri
acclamation
as
the
sun
and
warm
gave
back
his
witnesshood
his
ready
conquest
had
been
well
begun
how
few
there
be
who
see
beyond
their
sight
even
in
our
day
of
peculence
and
power
the
horizon
of
man
has
been
his
might
beyond
his
ready
reach
he
passes
into
night
the
world
is
bounded
by
its
present
hour
no
marvel
that
old
uri
swept
the
field
his
snare
was
baited
for
their
ready
sense
no
effort
theirs
a
pleasure
but
to
yield
theirs
but
the
open
book
to
them
unsealed
they
felt
no
weight
of
future
recompense
and
so
they
shouted
high
and
loud
his
praise
he
recalled
them
with
his
magic
voice
old
kohen
seems
in
earnest
let
us
raise
our
altars
quickly
that
we
may
rejoice
this
day
in
our
great
father
warm
embrace
that
we
may
look
unblushing
in
his
face
and
call
his
fervent
rays
to
their
full
test
ere
he
shall
draw
the
curtain
in
the
west
so
said
so
done
two
altars
were
soon
reared
both
prophets
in
full
confidence
appeared
the
offerings
have
been
brought
and
now
they
wait
only
the
word
the
king
must
give
command
against
gray
kohen
was
the
leveled
fate
of
his
unsolaced
anger
yet
his
hand
was
stayed
by
counsel
and
he
only
said
uri
calls
first
let
every
breath
be
hushed
upon
his
calling
let
the
dead
from
out
their
cerements
beneath
bear
witness
with
our
spirits
that
we
seek
a
true
solution
to
the
psalm
of
life
slay
thou
the
offering
uri
and
then
speak
speak
the
charmed
word
and
close
the
strife
uri
comes
forth
and
in
one
hand
he
brings
the
talisman
with
leathern
circlet
stayed
enclosing
surfaces
convex
to
this
he
clings
as
though
the
whole
earth
in
the
balance
laid
were
mean
in
weight
compared
to
such
a
gem
the
other
holds
a
knife
and
with
a
stroke
the
offering
is
prepared
he
looked
at
them
the
thirsting
hungry
eyes
that
watch
then
broke
the
silence
turning
full
upon
the
sun
thy
will
most
radiant
god
thy
will
be
done
o
shining
face
of
the
unchanging
one
look
in
the
pity
thou
alone
canst
feel
and
lead
us
back
to
life
we
claim
thy
pledge
a
nation
lifts
to
thee
their
centered
prayer
they
see
thy
smile
they
know
thy
heart
of
hearts
they
hush
them
here
upon
their
altar
brink
for
they
can
go
no
nearer
meet
thou
them
and
as
we
look
upon
thy
face
may
we
behold
thy
very
presence
in
our
midst
come
as
a
flame
to
lick
this
offering
up
and
all
our
hearts
shall
melt
into
thy
smile
he
raised
the
gem
before
the
flaming
sun
the
rays
concentered
and
the
flames
burst
forth
as
leaping
to
their
master
was
enough
the
multitude
in
thought
became
as
one
and
all
save
kohen
sank
upon
their
knees
and
whispers
of
relief
fell
on
the
breeze
they
were
as
pliant
clay
in
uri
hands
and
hung
upon
the
breath
of
his
commands
pour
forth
your
homage
chosen
of
the
sun
once
more
his
warmth
encloses
and
we
feel
responsive
throbbings
of
his
fatherhood
rise
and
rejoice
their
ready
voices
raise
from
lips
new
touched
in
unison
of
praise
old
kohen
was
confounded
at
the
first
he
had
not
thought
it
possible
to
bring
fire
from
the
sun
or
any
mortal
thing
no
shadow
of
its
secret
on
him
burst
but
he
had
heard
of
sorcery
and
arts
among
the
sons
of
mizraim
and
not
long
before
the
lion
of
his
nature
starts
in
cold
defiance
of
the
clamorous
throng
to
slay
his
offering
and
his
lips
poured
out
the
very
of
earnest
prayer
a
fervency
that
would
not
harbor
doubt
that
ever
is
a
stranger
to
despair
long
earnest
loud
and
fervently
he
prayed
and
his
gray
locks
ensilvering
the
breeze
gave
pathos
to
the
torrent
thus
unstayed
yet
not
for
self
did
he
the
angel
seize
but
wrestled
for
his
people
thus
misled
unscale
their
eyes
o
father
so
he
pled
unstop
their
ears
o
thou
all
powerful
one
that
they
may
hear
thy
footfall
on
the
wind
come
in
thy
flame
and
purge
them
with
thy
fire
strike
off
the
fetters
from
their
prisoned
souls
make
me
an
offering
for
their
flagrant
sins
and
i
will
bare
my
bosom
to
the
knife
and
bend
my
neck
in
cheerfulness
to
thee
so
thou
wilt
save
my
people
from
the
hand
of
this
misguided
witch
of
mizraim
his
prayer
had
hardly
ceased
ere
shot
the
flame
from
upper
zenith
down
and
in
one
glow
pierced
the
whole
altar
with
impetuous
claim
and
lapped
the
other
with
its
overflow
the
crowd
transfixed
with
wonder
at
the
scene
could
hardly
trust
the
witness
of
their
eyes
and
held
divided
counsels
till
the
king
quenching
the
current
of
their
late
surprise
poured
his
recruited
anger
on
kohen
why
longer
parley
with
a
thing
so
plain
old
kohen
had
no
warrant
for
this
deed
the
palm
was
uri
who
did
rightly
gain
fire
from
the
sun
to
him
alone
we
plead
he
drew
it
first
old
kohen
must
admit
and
he
should
paid
due
homage
to
our
god
and
from
what
source
did
his
become
enlit
we
serve
no
phantom
with
its
hidden
nod
but
look
upon
the
face
of
him
we
serve
the
sun
has
kept
his
fire
for
us
these
years
and
we
his
children
never
can
deserve
his
untold
blessings
though
our
prayers
and
tears
should
mingle
with
each
altar
that
we
raise
in
all
the
future
ages
still
our
debt
will
always
be
uncancelled
by
our
praise
and
all
our
past
be
covered
with
regret
we
want
no
juggling
on
this
sacred
day
that
gives
us
back
the
father
we
had
lost
bind
old
kohen
and
hasten
him
away
he
shall
repay
his
treachery
with
cost
shall
another
altar
grace
this
precious
grove
made
sacred
to
the
sun
and
kohen
shall
be
offered
in
this
place
to
pay
the
sacrilege
he
had
begun
in
thy
own
way
our
father
we
must
wait
so
many
times
because
we
can
not
see
yet
thou
alone
canst
bring
us
to
the
gate
how
slowly
do
we
learn
to
trust
in
thee
yet
in
withholding
are
the
blessings
hid
as
frequent
as
in
giving
all
our
prayers
if
they
result
in
doing
but
thy
bid
will
scatter
diamond
dust
above
our
cares
the
gray
old
prophet
murmured
let
god
will
be
done
and
in
abeyance
i
will
bare
my
breast
i
will
not
doubt
him
though
indeed
he
kill
his
chosen
way
must
surely
be
the
best
the
morrow
came
and
at
the
king
command
the
multitude
assembled
and
the
guard
brought
forth
the
prophet
looking
proudly
grand
as
some
great
warrior
claiming
his
reward
of
beys
and
laurels
wreathed
into
a
crown
they
rear
the
pile
and
he
awaits
his
doom
without
a
menace
and
without
a
frown
then
turning
to
the
press
i
will
assume
your
hearts
are
mine
my
sons
i
know
it
well
your
eyes
beheld
the
witness
of
our
god
and
greatly
were
ye
moved
but
is
his
will
that
i
should
join
my
fathers
in
that
land
where
canker
and
corruption
never
comes
the
why
and
wherefore
of
it
is
his
own
i
bow
my
head
in
thankfulness
to
him
that
he
has
deemed
me
worthy
to
exchange
a
life
of
sorrow
for
a
crown
of
love
ye
are
the
servants
of
an
earthly
king
and
god
has
suffered
him
to
lead
you
off
his
will
be
done
but
i
must
tell
you
now
your
future
as
i
read
it
in
the
glass
of
my
illumined
death
i
see
the
black
of
mizraim
sweep
the
brown
of
lud
from
off
the
face
of
egypt
and
i
also
see
a
wandering
race
go
northward
and
to
east
i
see
a
bitter
wintering
of
snow
i
see
the
sun
hide
back
his
face
from
them
i
see
a
boisterous
buffeting
at
sea
i
see
a
journey
southward
a
new
world
and
centuries
flow
swiftly
on
my
sight
a
people
proudly
resting
in
their
wealth
the
son
of
god
in
the
full
flight
of
years
the
conquest
of
the
nations
in
his
name
a
proud
and
prosperous
people
cross
the
sea
and
swoop
upon
this
nation
of
the
sun
their
temples
crumble
in
the
hand
of
god
and
he
takes
back
his
own
all
this
i
see
as
what
can
not
avert
it
is
god
way
and
wisdom
is
the
wastage
of
his
throne
he
can
not
order
wrongly
i
submit
my
wasting
image
to
his
waiting
hands
come
father
i
am
ready
he
raised
him
to
the
pile
with
look
divine
he
prone
himself
upon
it
at
the
sign
the
prophet
uri
raised
the
crystal
stone
the
sun
threw
down
its
rays
and
shot
the
flame
full
to
the
center
as
the
altar
shone
each
eye
was
turned
and
every
voice
was
tame
as
down
the
chancel
of
the
deep
blue
sky
a
flaming
chariot
sped
and
came
a
cry
it
is
enough
come
higher
up
thou
shalt
not
suffer
death
a
hand
not
human
caught
the
grand
old
prophet
his
recumbent
form
rose
on
their
dazzled
sight
as
rainbow
in
the
storm
thus
was
the
error
fixed
and
it
is
well
we
leave
them
to
their
blindness
for
a
while
misguided
worship
left
alone
will
tell
its
own
pathetic
story
there
is
guile
to
underlie
each
sorrow
of
the
race
fruit
comes
alone
from
seed
somewhere
is
sown
the
germ
of
every
grief
and
nature
on
its
face
bears
no
repentant
feature
as
we
plant
so
shall
the
tree
be
grown
expulsion
from
egypt
the
seasons
pass
till
on
their
hands
they
count
four
palms
and
to
the
third
a
score
and
three
in
life
meridian
how
the
circles
mount
that
measure
our
existence
if
there
be
no
canker
worm
that
clogs
the
ready
wheel
if
care
hangs
not
upon
the
skirts
of
time
and
if
like
most
mankind
we
only
feel
its
gentle
passing
by
the
hills
we
climb
in
ambling
easy
way
and
retrospect
surprises
into
thought
and
we
wake
up
to
feel
how
swift
we
journey
we
reflect
after
reflection
barrens
of
its
fruit
the
cup
which
we
have
mixed
we
drink
if
it
be
gall
we
gulp
it
down
the
same
we
can
not
change
the
current
of
our
lives
and
useless
is
the
call
on
any
but
the
hand
of
god
is
strange
the
miracle
of
life
should
ever
pass
and
print
no
letters
deep
into
the
soul
the
years
go
by
and
but
the
tuft
of
grass
more
reverent
than
we
tells
our
dust
its
rosary
in
deep
green
scroll
mizraim
and
lud
near
the
rim
of
karoun
where
the
pyramids
drink
the
dew
that
should
dampen
the
soil
and
the
nilus
pours
over
its
green
level
banks
its
annual
freightage
of
spoil
where
the
date
ripens
dark
to
the
child
of
the
sun
and
the
pomegranate
colors
for
fruit
the
ibis
is
sounding
the
damps
of
the
land
and
earth
in
its
plethory
mute
the
fat
of
the
fields
husks
the
voice
of
the
morn
while
demeter
is
weighing
her
sheaves
the
lotus
has
honied
its
lips
for
the
kiss
and
the
turtle
in
mockery
grieves
what
is
that
where
the
orient
gathers
her
gold
and
the
eye
wanders
back
to
the
sea
what
cloud
on
the
horizon
breach
can
be
seen
what
wakens
the
vulture
rude
glee
is
the
shock
of
the
battle
that
burdens
the
air
and
the
armies
that
burden
the
eye
they
have
met
could
elysian
give
landscape
more
fair
have
met
to
embrace
and
to
die
the
prophet
still
lives
and
has
led
to
the
sun
all
egypt
and
gathered
as
one
the
people
to
hallow
the
feast
ere
the
work
of
the
year
is
done
but
mizraim
outnumbers
the
children
of
lud
and
the
shepherd
kings
crafty
and
weak
have
laid
tasks
on
their
shoulders
too
heavy
to
bear
till
the
voice
of
their
burden
must
speak
in
vain
the
gray
prophet
lifts
up
to
his
god
his
winglet
of
prayer
for
peace
the
tempest
of
war
has
broke
over
the
plain
and
his
altars
can
bring
no
surcease
the
black
and
the
bronze
the
iron
and
brass
how
they
struggle
and
grip
for
the
field
the
spear
and
the
arrow
the
halbert
and
lance
and
who
shall
be
first
to
yield
not
the
iron
it
is
strong
and
resistless
in
weight
not
the
brass
it
is
beaten
and
firm
what
a
hecate
of
agony
burdens
the
plain
what
a
banquet
for
vulture
and
worm
but
the
iron
is
too
heavy
the
brass
is
too
thin
and
under
the
weight
it
gives
way
as
a
wall
that
is
breached
and
toppled
by
time
and
mizraim
gains
the
day
oppression
when
reversed
is
double
weight
the
slave
pours
lead
into
the
lash
he
bore
and
as
the
master
adds
recruited
hate
to
blows
that
he
has
learned
to
feel
before
the
soul
its
letters
of
forgiveness
learns
from
only
one
great
master
in
all
time
revenge
is
human
and
forever
burns
upon
the
trackway
of
retreating
crime
the
text
and
testwork
of
their
lives
was
lost
and
when
the
king
was
slain
and
they
his
people
paid
their
tyranny
with
cost
only
the
prophet
with
his
magic
stone
could
purchase
their
withdrawal
they
must
leave
they
were
the
early
jewels
of
the
sun
and
uri
pledged
their
fortunes
to
retrieve
if
they
would
journey
where
the
day
begun
and
seek
the
closer
presence
of
their
god
in
paths
where
human
feet
had
never
trod
they
must
divide
with
egypt
but
go
out
well
laden
for
the
journey
should
they
dare
to
turn
the
heavy
hand
of
mizraim
would
not
spare
ægyptus
thou
above
thy
gates
hath
writ
so
many
times
the
monosylbic
when
we
weary
of
conjecture
round
us
flit
the
phantoms
of
the
past
and
we
again
pass
in
review
thy
pages
black
with
mold
intemporate
within
a
crumbling
earth
against
the
char
of
empires
thou
dost
hold
the
charms
that
emulate
immortal
birth
we
write
mutation
on
the
brow
of
time
thou
art
the
changeless
one
of
all
the
world
thou
hast
no
brotherhood
in
any
clime
all
mortal
barbets
have
in
vain
been
hurled
time
conquers
all
things
thou
back
the
lie
above
its
ruins
thou
dost
stand
serene
eternity
must
thou
perforce
then
die
what
tragedy
hast
thou
indeed
not
seen
must
thou
too
look
on
death
thou
wilt
not
dim
but
in
impassive
slumber
thou
wilt
fall
as
sinks
the
sun
beneath
the
horizon
rim
and
answer
only
the
archangel
call
we
leave
thee
loathely
for
our
souls
are
wed
to
thy
enchanted
gardenhood
of
lore
the
morning
stars
sang
joy
above
thy
bed
the
nations
in
their
cerements
shall
pass
thy
door
and
earth
be
wrapped
in
ashes
ere
thy
brow
shall
bear
the
fatal
legend
nevermore
the
mourning
shepherds
the
tambour
is
silent
o
god
of
the
nile
the
harp
has
been
hung
in
acacian
shade
we
are
bowed
to
the
earth
we
are
broken
and
bent
and
the
blade
of
our
fathers
in
dust
has
been
laid
we
came
as
the
simoom
creeps
over
the
plain
we
came
as
the
tiger
its
covert
forsakes
as
the
hurricane
brushes
the
dust
from
the
brakes
as
the
lightning
leaps
out
and
the
shakes
we
are
shorn
of
our
strength
as
with
plague
we
are
smote
the
axe
has
been
wrenched
from
the
hands
that
are
brawn
and
the
arms
whose
strong
sinews
till
now
were
unbent
have
been
broken
as
brittles
our
prowess
is
gone
o
thou
bright
shining
god
with
thy
scintles
of
gold
if
thy
children
have
gathered
the
glow
of
thy
face
if
thy
kisses
ere
warmed
to
the
lips
that
are
cold
o
we
pray
let
us
feel
thy
impassioned
embrace
we
are
journeying
forth
to
the
cradle
of
morn
where
thy
lids
feel
the
weight
of
their
slumbering
still
we
would
kneel
at
thy
bed
where
the
seasons
are
born
and
learn
from
thy
lips
the
whole
law
of
thy
will
have
we
sinned
in
thy
sight
have
we
slackened
our
pace
are
we
paying
the
forfeit
in
wormwood
of
shame
we
draw
nearer
to
thee
and
our
lives
we
would
place
in
the
hands
of
the
maker
that
out
of
thy
flame
we
may
gather
that
fire
that
shall
glow
with
thy
love
and
will
never
grow
dim
through
the
future
of
years
that
shall
make
us
like
thee
and
our
fealty
prove
we
learn
to
forget
this
dark
trackhood
of
tears
as
we
turn
to
the
east
wilt
thou
smile
on
our
way
wilt
thou
lessen
the
distance
between
us
and
thee
or
our
hearts
remain
hungry
the
shadow
still
stay
with
its
wizard
arm
lifted
to
smite
as
we
flee
we
doubt
thee
no
longer
we
know
thou
wilt
aid
we
turn
to
the
path
where
thy
morning
rays
shine
we
will
seek
thy
first
footfall
and
all
unafraid
we
feel
thee
we
love
thee
we
know
we
are
thine
we
leave
the
old
life
with
the
graves
of
our
kin
we
turn
from
the
sunset
of
dampness
and
death
we
turn
where
the
light
with
its
god
doth
begin
and
the
praise
of
the
embalms
every
breath
where
the
sun
slakes
his
thirst
with
the
dew
of
the
flowers
where
the
night
flees
before
him
far
into
the
west
where
the
clings
to
the
hours
where
the
soul
sets
its
table
with
joy
as
its
guest
so
does
our
faith
stand
out
against
our
grief
so
does
our
hope
grow
up
into
belief
one
god
yes
father
thou
and
only
one
we
praise
thee
yet
our
praise
is
only
done
when
we
extol
thee
for
the
gift
of
faith
not
every
one
can
name
thee
but
each
breath
may
be
enladen
with
the
thought
of
praise
and
all
adore
thy
attributes
the
ways
that
they
adore
thee
are
not
always
thine
yet
do
they
bend
to
thy
great
thoroughfare
and
shine
with
light
from
the
eternal
throne
is
well
nor
otherwise
than
good
it
can
but
swell
the
choral
of
thy
praise
and
in
the
end
these
thousand
thoughts
of
deity
in
thee
not
fail
to
blend
the
journey
o
thou
who
charmed
the
demons
in
the
breast
of
saul
and
set
the
universal
voice
of
all
the
earth
to
thy
unflagging
song
thou
royal
shepherd
bend
for
us
across
the
bridge
of
ages
thy
leant
lips
and
pour
the
echo
of
thy
music
on
our
souls
and
thou
of
nazareth
whose
very
life
was
as
the
cadence
of
a
harp
thyself
the
instrument
upon
whose
strings
ten
thousand
symphonies
are
left
entranced
pour
in
the
empty
vial
of
our
verse
some
of
thy
soul
of
music
and
let
shine
through
every
darkened
crevice
of
the
heart
rays
of
celestial
sunshine
not
in
vain
our
humble
dalliance
if
thou
set
the
charm
of
thine
approval
let
our
song
be
praise
and
devotate
our
hands
that
there
be
left
no
tissue
but
is
animate
of
thee
the
seas
reach
out
to
clasp
each
other
hands
the
greater
and
the
less
and
leap
the
sands
that
tear
in
two
their
waters
but
not
so
she
of
the
nile
her
rights
will
not
forego
the
hand
that
rocks
the
crib
of
empire
holds
a
charm
that
locks
the
east
and
west
in
one
the
track
of
nations
is
her
beaten
path
and
undisputed
till
the
earth
be
done
man
may
disturb
it
but
the
hand
of
god
has
placed
a
thousand
tokens
on
this
sod
the
flocks
are
gathered
and
the
flight
began
old
uri
and
attendants
in
the
van
the
portents
were
of
good
as
far
as
seen
each
breast
a
shrine
of
hope
thus
early
man
gave
little
time
to
sorrow
after
years
were
left
for
its
fruition
light
of
heart
these
germlets
of
the
earth
took
their
reverses
in
the
better
part
of
hardihood
they
had
thus
early
learned
that
in
the
chafe
of
fortune
there
is
gain
that
scars
are
coronets
though
they
be
burned
deep
in
the
brow
of
care
each
gem
a
pain
our
philosophic
age
with
heavy
draught
drinks
deep
in
phantasies
but
fails
to
learn
the
wiser
lesson
of
this
early
craft
to
catch
the
wheel
of
fortune
with
each
turn
east
over
syria
they
bent
their
steps
meeting
euphrates
many
leagues
above
where
babylon
since
molded
into
form
her
mystical
proportions
and
so
strove
persistently
the
mastery
of
earth
crossing
the
tigris
but
a
span
below
where
taurus
from
his
fountains
feeds
the
stream
they
traverse
persia
with
its
of
conquest
where
ispahan
gave
touch
to
chords
that
deify
the
voice
of
song
and
mellow
through
the
ages
if
so
much
as
but
an
echo
would
inspire
the
tongue
with
that
enchantment
that
rolls
down
the
course
of
her
great
history
we
seek
in
vain
another
cyrus
or
another
force
of
scripture
fulfillment
with
lesser
pain
and
time
repleted
garner
has
no
riper
grain
still
east
they
cross
the
amoo
and
above
where
now
bokhara
languor
and
repose
invites
the
sclavic
hordes
in
summer
quest
of
forage
and
belor
giant
like
still
throws
its
shadow
the
landscape
and
the
koosh
shortens
the
noon
of
summer
from
the
south
a
thousand
sparkling
torrents
downward
rush
and
pour
their
waste
of
waters
in
the

had
spent
upon

they
could
not

than

fiercely
on

creep
so

that
our
souls
are

if

they
find
us
napping
in

wakeful
age
and
how
much
more
in
the
unrisen
sun
of
ancient
man
we
wonder
that
the
page
is
not
more
blurred
and
blotted
in
the
years
that
are
far
gone
when
knowledge
only
bubbled
up
through

a
winter
on

strokes
his
heavy

in
glee
in
surfeit
of
his
triumph
the
foe
that
dares
invade
his
borders
and
the
snow
scatters
its
fleecy
fullness
the
land
hiding
the
face
of
nature
with
its
hand
so
cold
and
clasping
o
is
very
hard
to
see
familiar
faces
pass
the
ward
of
our
immediate
contact
and
the
earth
draw
back
into
its
arms
with
tightening
girth
our
loved
ones
but
is
a
heavier
lot
to
see
our
mother
earth
whose
faithful
breast
has
never
failed
to
aid
so
chilled
in
death
that
it
can
not
respond
though
it
be
rest
recuperent
and
needful
still
the
same
when
we
are
starving
for
its
warm
caress
and
can
not
spare
its
nursing
when
our
claim
is
mortal
and
we
feel
the
strong
hand
press
our
vitals
and
we
labor
for
our
breath
and
famine
lends
its
wizard
hand
to
fill
the
tooth
of
death
old
uri
vainly
calls
the
shining
god
though
it
may
light
his
altar
still
the
flame
is
but
a
weakling
and
the
weary
host
were
wrangling
at
his
impotence
and
tame
his
efforts
to
assuage
them
he
had
taught
his
followers
of
a
near
approach
the
sun
seemed
coy
of
his
endeavors
for
the
thought
of
zone
or
solstice
had
not
then
begun
and
winter
was
their
time
of
penance
when
their
god
rode
low
and
frowned
him
out
of
sight
they
offered
for
his
anger
many
gifts
and
set
their
watchmen
to
outwake
the
night
in
question
of
his
rising
why
should
he
keep
so
much
closer
the
horizon
rim
when
they
were
in
his
quest
and
sought
the
verge
of
farthest
empire
in
their
reach
of
him
o
empty
arms
and
ever
reaching
out
fold
in
the
blessings
that
your
hands
enclose
there
is
nor
reason
nor
excuse
for
doubt
the
river
of
god
love
so
near
you
flows
your
very
feet
are
on
the
water
brink
his
very
arms
are
all
around
you
thrown
you
touch
him
in
your
timidness
and
shrink
to
his
embraces
no
human
soul
was
ever
yet
alone
they
settle
down
to
winter
and
their
flocks
must
furnish
sustenance
until
the
sun
shall
break
their
penance
and
embrown
the
locks
of
the
seasons
and
this
won
they
counsel
further
movement
uri
speaks
sons
of
the
summer
god
i
little
thought
when
we
set
out
from
egypt
that
our
feet
would
be
thus
bruised
and
bled
but
it
is
well
we
learn
the
lesson
of
our
latent
sin
this
trial
of
our
faith
will
make
us
whole
if
we
but
draw
the
diamond
out
of
it
we
have
not
vainly
trod
the
heavy
press
of
our
affliction
if
we
firmly
breast
the
waters
i
have
kept
faithful
watch
we
are
but
lords
and
forfeit
much
of
our
asserted
masterhood
the
birds
make
many
less
mistakes
we
used
to
note
the
flight
of
waterfowl
in
egypt
why
should
we
not
learn
their
wisdom
in
this
clime
before
the
sun
sank
low
and
winter
came
led
by
a
providence
that
makes
all
things
to
minister
our
wants
i
watched
the
birds
and
many
turned
to
east
across
the
sea
we
lose
our
way
sometimes
they
never
do
they
are
much
closer
children
to
the
sun
than
we
by
their
dependence
we
need
help
as
much
as
any
feathered
wingster
does
and
yet
we
push
it
back
when
we
might
reach
and
find
a
steady
hand
let
us
go
to
and
make
us
ships
that
when
the
spring
shall
beckon
back
to
life
the
dormant
earth
and
all
the
birds
turn
back
in
countermarch
we
fly
against
their
flight
and
reach
the
clime
from
whence
the
sun
has
warned
them
to
return
to
this
cold
country
of
the
nether
earth
behold
these
rugged
trees
stand
stout
for
us
and
ready
for
our
architrave
and
we
were
better
wont
to
labor
than
to
dole
our
time
in
murmurs
at
our
fate
up
up
and
do
and
though
we
suffer
overmuch
our
labor
shall
not
vainly
mock
at
us
even
old
kohen
saw
a
journey
south
when
he
did
burn
our
eyes
as
he
went
up
and
he
saw
fat
and
plenty
in
the
land
where
his
prophetic
eye
did
cast
our
lot
and
we
will
not
mistrust
what
leads
to
light
though
it
be
lifted
in
a
demon
hand
the
forests
gave
to
them
their
virgin
palms
and
they
did
rudely
shape
them
into
crafts
made
ready
for
the
flood
when
the
warm
sun
should
waken
nature
with
enlivening
draughts
but
spring
wore
into
summer
ere
the
birds
gave
the
unspoken
pledge
of
their
return
the
sun
still
coy
refused
to
climb
as
high
as
it
had
done
in
egypt
still
they
burn
with
hope
as
they
float
down
to
sea
and
moving
counter
to
their
winged
friends
cross
to
lopatka
where
they
only
wait
replenishment
which
nature
always
sends
where
faith
is
instinct
as
in
lower
life
the
birds
teach
providence
without
a
chance
and
so
they
wander
on
to
the
aleutes
passing
and
calling
as
they
still
advance
they
reach
to
where
alaska
strikes
the
sea
in
severance
to
meet
them
they
kept
on
feeding
on
eggs
of
seabirds
and
the
meats
that
everywhere
supplied
them
they
have
gone
so
far
on
nature
very
track
and
now
a
narrow
river
beckons
their
research
and
they
pass
upward
till
a
mountain
range
confronts
their
passage
like
a
royal
perch
from
which
the
gods
might
frown
their
hardihood
for
this
intrusion
of
another
world
but
they
have
battled
with
the
plague
and
flood
and
though
olympus
all
his
thunders
hurled
they
had
not
turned
they
saw
the
earnest
need
of
pushing
forward
ere
the
sun
turned
back
and
so
they
crossed
to
where
the
eastern
slope
feeds
the
mckenzie
here
an
easy
track
leads
down
and
cuts
the
stronger
range
in
two
a
little
while
among
its
shadows
grope
when
the
broad
prospect
opened
to
their
view
they
follow
the
receding
sun
in
hope
still
bearing
to
the
east
their
steady
trend
hoping
to
win
their
god
to
close
embrace
and
morn
and
eve
around
their
altars
bend
in
thankfulness
that
they
still
see
his
face
through
many
valleys
virgin
to
their
sight
and
many
lakes
whose
bosoms
never
stirred
to
man
the
weak
pretender
of
god
might
but

spreads
her
happy
hearth
with

and

thy
monuments
of
stone
to
overtop
the
pyramids
yet
wrought
in
shapely
mounds
thy
sculpturehood
and
caught
from
flying
time
the
lustre
of
his
wing

gives
the
semblance

perpetual

such

must
not

the
unfading

written
on

side
thy
brow
wast
glistered
with
the
frost
of
years
ere

first
rapture
at
the
sight
of
thee
yet
were
thy
banks
unswelled
by
falling
tears
till
he
tore
back
thy
splendid
tapestry
the
bison
and
the
deer
unfrighted
came
to
lave
upon
thy
borders
all
were
tame
in
their
untoilsome
frolics
and
the
beasts
and
birds
made
rolic
at
thy
feet
in
songs
not
marred
with
words
but
sorrow
comes
with
knowledge
is
the
tree
that
bears
the
samest
fruit
in
every
zone
the
tale
of
eden
is
no
mystery
the
tree
will
verify
wherever
grown
and
yet
in
god
own
providence
is
best
that
eden
be
repeated
east
and
west
if
knowledge
in
the
first
brought
sorrowhood
to
earth
the
power
to
laugh
and
cry
were
purchased
at
one
birth
they
stand
upon
thy
borders
mighty
stream
we
will
not
pry
thy
silent
lips
apart
to
ask
thee
when
and
how
the
prophet
dream
reached
its
fulfillment
treasured
in
thy
heart
let
it
remain
as
many
other
things
are
left
our
language
lessens
their
effect
and
makes
them
small
in
words
the
very
springs
of
our
existence
are
not
shown
correct
when
crowded
into
verbage
so
we
lay
our
beys
upon
thee
and
we
feel
is
thine
thine
every
secret
of
the
grand
emprise
with
only
one
unlicensed
hand
the
hand
of
the
divine
it
is
enough
that
after
waste
and
want
and
weariness
of
spirit
they
have
found
a
rest
upon
thy
margin
that
thy
arms
are
opened
to
enclose
them
and
the
sound
of
human
voices
mingle
with
the
notes
of
myriad
waterfowl
the
thousand
throats
of
thy
unmeasured
pasture
blend
in
praise
to
the
all
father
for
the
countless
ways
that
point
his
providence
the
raven
cry
strikes
never
vainly
thy
omniscient
ear
no
effort
but
is
answered
here
am
i
no
prayer
but
finds
the
parent
very
near
the
unconscious
hallelujahs
of
the
plain
the
untaught
praises
of
the
lofty
trees
the
waving
upward
palms
of
laden
grain
the
mellow
notes
upon
the
evening
breeze
the
reveillies
from
off
the
mountain
tops
the
nightingale
tattoo
the
many
lips
touched
only
once
by
god
the
faithful
drops
that
wear
unceasing
at
the
granite
mine
the
praise
that
never
sinks
to
prayer
the
finger
tips
that
span
the
universal
zone
of
life
all
all
incline
to
adoration
if
we
lose
our
way
as
these
poor
souls
had
done
we
need
but
turn
to
catch
the
choral
of
the
passing
day
behold
on
every
branch
and
beam
the
altars
burn
and
all
things
beckon
us
of
god
if
we
but
bend
the
enquiring
ear
and
catch
the
keynote
of
the
mighty
song
that
swells
from
all
the
universe
we
too
may
blend
in
the
vast
concord
happiest
of
the
throng
the
rhythmal
of
the
angels
is
not
far
from
the
first
prattle
of
the
infant
tongue
both
caught
the
glitter
of
the
eastern
star
the
harps
were
both
by
the
same
master
strung
the
glory
of
the
one
glows
from
the
face
the
other
lifts
to
meet
its
parent
kiss
not
very
far
the
border
land
of
bliss
from
every
infant
of
the
human
race
the
sacred
fane
of
childhood
when
first
reared
how
like
a
prophecy
it
should
be
read
a
thing
to
be
adored
and
sometimes
feared
so
many
unseen
hands
smooth
down
the
bed
of
infancy
we
can
but
jostle
with
our
utmost
care
against
angelic
presences
that
bend
and
print
their
unseen
kisses
on
the
brow
and
with
the
infant
earth
the
heavenly
essence
blend
the
wheel
that
never
tires
and
ever
turns
crushing
the
neck
of
nations
in
its
round
before
whose
tread
the
star
of
empire
burns
behind
whose
trend
the
ridged
and
furrowed
ground
gives
mute
quiescence
to
the
master
hand
this
wheel
rolls
on
and
now
upon
thy
banks
great
river
of
the
west
the
infant
cry
is
mingled
with
the
forest
din
thy
ranks
are
opened
to
admit
the
lullaby
of
earth
last
entity
thou
not
groan
when
buffalo
and
beaver
found
thy
side
nor
when
thy
trees
first
echoed
to
the
moan
of
the
despondent
turtle
to
his
bride
and
thou
smile
on
this
invading
race
and
open
thy
broad
prairies
as
the
palm
of
some
great
hearted
giant
to
embrace
the
wanderers
the
healing
balm
of
thy
great
heaving
breast
rubbed
almost
out
the
wrinkles
from
the
faces
of
these
sires
of
early
egypt
they
forgot
the
drought
and
mildew
of
their
wanderings
and
the
fires
of
their
thanksgiving
altars
gave
a
zest
they
never
yet
had
felt
an
empire
spread
around
them
in
the
flush
of
its
full
growth
a
bride
inviting
the
espousal
bed
their
ranks
had
been
depleted
yet
a
few
still
lingered
with
the
prophet
who
had
stood
at
the
first
altar
when
the
fervent
sun
first
answered
their
entreaty
and
the
blood
was
lapped
by
solar
flame
and
now
that
peace
enshrines
their
hearts
and
plenty
spreads
their
board
they
warm
towards
their
leader
and
return
to
their
loyalty
his
word
is
sacred
as
the
smiling
of
the
sun
whose
burnished
mirror
likenesses
their
forms
and
in
whose
bosom
after
life
is
done
the
weary
find
a
shelter
from
all
storms
nor
do
they
want
a
psalmist
for
his
praise
but
he
is
found
with
ready
harp
and
voice
to
turn
the
multitude
with
rapturous
gaze
upon
the
god
of
their
unshaken
choice
their
morning
song
is
mingled
with
the
mirth
that
rolics
from
the
sycamore
and
oak
the
song
that
swells
the
green
and
fruent
earth
that
needs
no
trumpet
blare
nor
kettle
stroke
the
morning
song
of
the
mound
builders
once
more
do
we
turn
on
thy
face
our
glad
eyes
great
god
of
the
summer
and
sing
with
the
lark
and
the
linnet
we
gladly
arise
to
welcome
the
smile
of
our
king
our
hearts
are
made
glad
when
we
feel
thee
advance
on
thy
mission
of
mercy
and
might
for
we
know
that
the
stroke
of
thy
conquering
lance
has
shattered
the
bulwarks
of
night
we
look
on
thy
face
and
our
doubts
are
dispelled
by
the
glance
of
thy
mellowing
eye
for
we
feel
that
the
rains
by
our
master
are
held
and
we
fear
not
to
do
or
to
die
we
felt
thy
embrace
many
long
weary
years
yet
the
scales
were
not
torn
from
our
eyes
we
sought
for
a
father
with
prayers
and
with
tears
till
we
woke
with
a
welcome
surprise
and
beheld
from
thy
face
the
fatherhood
shine
and
thy
great
glowing
heart
ablaze
with
the
love
that
had
lingered
and
grown
more
divine
in
the
yearn
of
our
wandering
days
how
we
leaped
to
thy
arms
when
we
saw
them
extend
how
we
drank
of
thy
fervent
embrace
with
its
love
like
thyself
glowing
on
without
end
in
the
gold
of
thy
deified
face
for
our
eyes
were
unscaled
and
our
hearts
were
unsealed
we
were
melted
to
tears
at
the
thought
of
the
blessings
so
near
that
had
stood
unrevealed
of
the
providence
waiting
unsought
how
could
we
have
lost
the
firm
grasp
of
thy
hand
with
its
daily
improvise
of
love
with
its
unsounded
depths
like
the
count
of
the
sand
as
an
index
to
point
us
above
and
now
hover
us
great
god
of
the
day
let
us
never
escape
from
thy
wing
for
ever
and
ever
drive
famine
away
give
wealth
to
our
summer
and
spring
give
us
harvests
of
fruit
give
us
winters
of
rest
let
thy
provident
hand
never
cease
grant
the
aged
a
home
on
thy
great
shining
breast
when
their
labors
shall
purchase
release
be
more
than
we
ask
give
us
more
than
our
prayer
all
our
wants
let
thy
wisdom
disclose
till
our
souls
shall
be
ripe
with
thy
fostering
care
and
made
white
for
our
future
repose
evening
thanksgiving
and
prayer
sinking
down
to
thy
rest
in
the
deep
crimson
west
great
god
thou
hast
taught
us
repose
with
thy
promised
return
without
doubting
we
learn
to
wait
for
thy
further
disclose
in
thy
tenement
high
blazing
over
the
sky
are
thy
sentinels
pledge
of
the
night
and
we
know
by
their
shine
that
thy
care
is
divine
and
we
rest
without
fear
till
the
light
springs
again
from
the
east
with
its
glory
increased
by
the
wakening
pulse
of
the
day
and
we
never
will
doubt
that
thy
naked
arm
stout
will
drive
all
the
shadows
away
yet
we
can
not
forebear
to
lift
up
our
prayer
for
we
know
we
are
wanton
and
weak
and
if
once
thou
shouldst
fail
or
thy
face
shouldst
grow
pale
where
else
in
the
world
should
we
seek
for
a
father
so
kind
to
a
people
so
blind
in
our
weakness
thy
strength
we
may
trace
then
fail
not
to
return
leave
us
never
to
mourn
the
wealth
of
thy
daily
embrace
o
continue
we
pray
to
bring
back
the
glad
day
give
us
always
to
look
on
thy
face
the
trembling
lisp
of
every
human
soul
of
names
more
potent
then
their
own
can
be
breathes
the
same
lesson
through
from
pole
to
pole
to
prove
the
certitude
of
deity
not
every
eye
turned
upward
can
behold
the
face
that
faith
alone
shapes
into
form
not
every
hand
can
touch
the
gates
of
gold
that
outward
swing
in
welcome
from
the
storm
yet
is
the
abba
father
pendant
from
each
tongue
and
every
soul
a
furnace
for
its
fires
and
sacred
is
each
song
in
earnest
sung
when
creature
to
creator
thus
aspires
we
blindly
grope
in
this
our
broad
of
day
the
two
eternities
to
thus
unite
the
silk
of
infancy
is
turned
to
gray
ere
we
have
learned
to
tread
the
path
aright
we
force
our
providences
out
of
reach
throw
back
the
hand
our
father
doth
extend
and
shut
our
ears
that
he
may
vainly
teach
and
all
the
wealth
of
heaven
may
expend
to
warm
us
to
reliance
shall
we
dare
to
sneer
at
those
who
grope
we
grapple
air
when
it
is
all
refulgent
with
our
god
and
we
may
touch
his
garment
hem
in
prayer
the
prophet
death
groping
in
undiscovered
realms
their
way
the
prophet
and
his
people
give
the
day
to
finding
safest
lodgement
till
they
press
well
down
the
grand
old
river
to
the
mouth
of
the
great
western
confluent
the
south
seems
to
add
summer
to
the
wilderness
they
cross
the
river
and
then
settle
down
to
love
and
labor
on
its
grassy
banks
and
fortune
seems
to
have
forgot
its
frown
years
of
repletion
fill
their
shattered
ranks
and
youth
and
vigor
take
the
place
of
age
the
story
of
their
journey
is
retold
by
only
few
in
number
and
the
sage
who
turned
their
faces
on
their
god
of
gold
was
bent
with
the
plethoric
weight
of
years
and
summoned
them
to
worship
the
tears
of
many
who
misgave
his
failing
strength
he
saw
their
apprehensions
and
at
length
called
them
together
for
a
final
word
sons
of
the
summer
god
it
is
but
wise
that
we
look
out
beyond
the
brace
of
years
and
question
of
the
future
all
the
way
the
shining
surface
of
our
god
has
led
our
toilsome
footsteps
we
must
not
forget
his
daily
nurture
nor
the
cloth
of
gold
with
which
he
covers
us
wakeful
with
the
day
how
has
he
touched
our
eyelids
with
his
hands
and
warmed
us
with
his
hovering
the
night
has
never
failed
his
promise
of
the
morn
how
has
his
parenthood
outwatched
the
stars
how
has
the
winter
melted
at
his
glance
how
has
his
armor
battled
with
the
snows
with
what
a
tenderness
he
decks
the
fields
and
wooes
the
grasses
from
the
dormant
earth
and
clothes
the
forest
with
its
robes
of
green
as
covert
for
the
bison
and
the
deer
that
we
may
find
replenishment
of
food
his
providence
has
never
failed
our
steps
our
homage
can
not
cancel
his
regard
our
father
in
this
failing
cup
of
years
help
us
to
be
to
thee
thou
hast
not
measured
to
our
helplessness
but
with
unstinted
hand
filled
up
our
lives
with
blessings
fill
thou
alike
our
hearts
that
we
may
have
no
room
to
cherish
doubt
but
answer
thy
embraces
as
the
fields
leap
up
to
kiss
thy
first
recumbent
rays
let
all
our
dross
become
thy
burnished
gold
shine
through
each
crevice
of
our
stubbornness
till
in
transparent
purity
we
reach
the
very
essence
of
thy
godliness
brethren
of
the
sun
this
altar
is
my
last
you
see
the
fire
leap
as
an
answer
to
my
late
request
and
it
shall
bear
my
spirit
to
the
sun
and
cursed
the
hand
that
stays
its
homeward
flight
fresh
nerved
he
reached
the
altar
with
a
bound
and
sank
without
a
murmur
in
the
flame
his
followers
an
instant
gather
round
but
he
had
passed
out
almost
as
he
came
they
did
not
dare
to
drag
him
from
the
pile
his
life
and
effort
had
together
ceased
he
passed
into
the
future
with
a
smile
a
smile
that
he
had
been
so
quick
released
yet
there
was
one
from
the
rest
who
said
she
saw
the
essence
of
his
form
in
brighter
effigy
more
richly
dressed
fly
out
into
the
sunset
and
the
charm
of
her
enchanted
parable
found
faith
in
many
of
the
multitude
his
death
so
like
his
life
had
challenged
all
their
thought
and
they
were
ready
to
quiesce
his
fate
and
sought
some
shadowed
miracle
to
wrap
his
shade
they
gathered
up
the
ashes
and
forbade
unsanctioned
hands
to
touch
them
and
they
reared
a
rugged
mound
above
the
garnered
dust
and
left
him
one
whom
they
loved
less
than
feared
to
that
sole
arbiter
whose
name
is
just
our
common
parent
time
whose
busy
hands
rear
many
a
sacred
fane
above
our
faults
flings
over
our
excressences
his
sands
and
leaves
no
human
stain
to
blot
the
sacred
marble
of
our
vaults
how
grand
is
the
economy
of
time
and
death
we
whet
the
knife
for
deep
incision
on
the
name
of
some
misguided
leader
but
he
fails
his
breath
and
all
our
better
angels
give
him
back
to
fame
death
carries
off
the
husk
we
keep
the
ripened
wheat
and
time
refines
the
kernel
into
choicest
flour
the
atmosphere
of
anger
is
at
last
made
sweet
our
charity
immortal
glows
our
passion
but
an
hour
god
keep
us
always
so
it
is
the
chosen
link
that
binds
us
to
the
race
and
bids
the
christ
come
in
that
holds
our
hands
to
near
the
eternal
brink
it
saves
us
from
ourselves
and
breaks
the
tooth
of
sin
the
whitened
garments
at
the
eternal
gate
must
cover
those
who
have
not
stained
another
or
there
will
come
that
awful
sentence
wait
blood
crieth
from
the
ground
where
is
thy
brother
if
thus
upon
the
living
god
doth
set
the
seal
of
condemnation
for
the
false
witnessing
how
will
he
smite
the
lips
of
those
who
steal
his
covering
from
the
dead
and
fill
the
sacred
spring
of
memory
with
the
debris
of
their
lives
mixing
what
god
has
kindly
torn
apart
and
making
null
the
severence
he
strives
between
the
naked
soul
and
sin
encumbered
heart
the
gem
was
melted
and
his
life
went
out
in
unobtrusive
secrecy
and
all
that
he
brought
with
him
passed
the
silent
way
into
eternity
beyond
recall
he
chose
no
sponsor
to
renew
his
place
but
gave
them
back
to
nature
as
he
found
yet
was
his
impress
fastened
on
the
race
and
every
morn
they
gathered
at
the
mound
for
many
after
years
till
they
had
grown
a
nation
strong
in
numbers
and
had
thrown
the
seeds
of
generation
far
and
wide
and
found
the
latent
valleys
without
guide
the
lakes
are
made
a
tribute
to
their
spoil
and
all
the
riches
of
the
virgin
soil
were
tested
by
those
hardy
argonauts
of
old
and
though
they
sought
no
fleece
of
shining
gold
they
penetrated
all
the
wilderness
that
lay
unclaimed
before
them
to
possess
god
drops
no
nobler
anchorage
on
earth
than
those
who
mold
a
nation
and
a
name
whose
travail
in
the
wilderness
gives
birth
to
some
great
epoch
without
thought
of
fame
the
pioneers
of
empire
for
all
time
are
from
the
placers
of
our
homes
the
surface
croppings
from
a
nation
prime
the
mellow
acre
of
the
richest
loams
they
overgrow
the
boundaries
of
life
and
push
the
horizon
far
out
in
space
with
lethargy
they
wage
a
ceaseless
strife
and
with
the
whirling
earth
they
keep
their
pace
all
honor
to
the
soul
who
sets
his
stake
where
human
kind
have
never
trenched
before
where
only
god
his
thunders
it
shake
and
solitude
shall
murmur
nevermore
such
men
are
sovereigns
though
they
grasp
no
crown
and
raise
no
jewelled
scepter
in
the
hand
yet
are
they
princes
in
their
bronze
and
brown
and
demonstrate
their
fitness
to
command
the
norsemen
on
the
north
atlantic
wave
columbus
passing
out
in
unknown

de
soto
gaining
but
an
unknown
grave
the
hardy
pilgrims
on
their
bended
knees
the
argonauts
upon
the
western
slope
these
are
the
souls
no
human
praise
can
reach
each
in
their
turn
gave
empire
back
to
hope
and
all
are
greater
than
the
gift
of
speech
no
pen
can
lustre
their
unfading
claim
no
cenotaph
do
honor
to
their
dust
these
are
crown
jewels
on
the
brow
of
fame
their
conquest
is
supreme
their
laurels
ever
just
yet
in
the
van
of
empire
still
is
left
the
noiseless
print
of
ancestry
more
grand
indentures
chiseled
in
the
highest
cleft
by
giants
of
a
long
forgotten
land
the
nameless
graves
of
centuries
untold
the
ashes
of
the
prehistoric
age
the
litany
of
gold
how
vast
their
monuments
how
broad
their
page
in
what
a
grand
democracy
of
death
they
lift
their
silent
fingers
to
our
years
melt
our
memorials
with
a
single
breath
in
mute
companionship
of
life
and
tears
we
are
but
pygmies
to
the
almighty
past
the
names
we
honor
but
the
beneath
must
lie
an
empire
far
more
vast
whose
fundaments
alone
deserve
the
name
of
old
not
many
years
till
they
had
found
the
bed
of
copper
ore
upon
superior
rim
and
hither
many
of
the
hardy
ones
were
led
by
orchas
quick
in
architrave
and
fleet
of
limb
and
many
the
fantastic
implements
he
shaped
for
husbandry
no
want
of
theirs
escaped
his
eager
scrutiny
the
axe
and
blade
the
pick
and
the
encumbered
spade
the
vessels
for
the
housewife
and
the
spear
and
other
weaponry
for
bison
and
for
deer
all
these
were
fashioned
in
an
uncouth
way
and
yet
they
filled
the
purpose
of
the
day
they
had
not
reached
the
iron
age
of
thought
and
what
they
made
necessity
had
taught
but
riper
years
must
ope
the
sampson
mine
and
wake
the
rugged
giant
in
the
shine
of
a
meridian
sunlight
they
little
thought
of
what
a
hercules
remained
unsought
so
near
missouri
border
yet
not
strange
is
their
indicted
ignorance
their
range
was
circumscribed
and
iron
was
left
to
rest
till
man
had
long
been
cradled
on
the
breast
of
patient
mother
earth
not
all
at
once
did
she
give
up
her
treasures
and
the
dunce
must
grow
into
philosopher
with
years
experience
with
its
battlehood
of
tears
is
nature
great
interpreter
we
learn
but
slowly
till
the
lessons
fervid
burn
their
impress
into
action
then
awakes
the
pupil
into
higher
life
invention
is
the
of
strife
necessity
the
hand
that
wields
the
sledge
upon
the
patient
anvil
of
our
needs
and
providence
makes
good
its
wakeful
pledge
with
plenteous
harvest
from
the
dormant
seeds
that
lie
unconed
beneath
our
very
feet
we
stumble
on
to
marvels
and
awake
to
find
some
giant
force
in
what
we
meet
and
in
the
insects
of
our
path
leviathans
we
greet
time
wheels
though
shaken
never
fail
to
track
the
rut
of
empire
without
turning
back
they
ceaseless
whirl
with
lubricate
of
blood
drawn
from
a
thousand
channels
on
the
way
unrusting
through
the
oxydizing
flood
to
measure
centuries
or
mark
a
day
and
thus
the
primal
pioneers
move
on
to
unaccustomed
progress
on
the
banks
of
the
confluent
streams
that
scar
the
face
of
the
great
western
basin
and
their
ranks
are
filled
with
happy
husbandry
the
land
gives
back
its
tillage
with
a
lavish
hand
the
forests
and
the
streams
were
with
fish
and
flesh
to
feed
them
and
they
pass
one
conquest
to
another
in
the
lull
of
untamed
nature
garnered
as
a
mass
to
fill
their
open
hands
the
native
corn
soon
covered
the
rich
valleys
and
the
plant
so
dalliant
to
the
race
was
early
born
tobacco
they
were
not
adamant
against
the
weaknesses
so
close
allied
to
human
nature
and
there
was
excess
and
envy
emulence
and
pride
and
all
the
ills
that
left
their
first
impress
and
yet
god
gave
them
peace
no
brother
hand
was
raised
against
a
brother
and
the
years
spread
fruit
and
plenty
over
a
fair
land
destined
to
futurehood
of
bitter
bitter
tears
departure
of
wabun
most
governed
is
most
wayward
very
true
repeating
history
doth
verify
that
law
from
malefaction
always
grew
and
with
its
ceasing
rulership
must
die
except
the
common
sway
of
deity
when
love
and
service
shall
together
blend
and
man
from
every
earthly
master
free
shall
recognize
his
father
and
his
friend
these
ancient
prairie
dwellers
had
no
need
of
stringent
government
a
few
to
lead
in
seeding
and
in
harvest
some
to
guide
in
matters
of
religion
and
of
form
the
rustic
swain
and
his
compliant
bride
to
join
in
wedlock
and
in
time
of
storm
to
smooth
the
little
intricates
of
life
with
counsel
sage
and
thus
avoiding
strife
to
guide
their
budding
nation
into
bloom
all
claiming
unction
from
the
prophet
shade
still
gave
their
worship
to
the
god
of
day
and
their
oblations
on
the
altar
laid
yet
the
responsive
accident
of
fire
could
never
be
recalled
they
little
knew
the
secret
of
its
coming
and
they
shaped
no
other
pebbles
like
the
one
so
true
to
uri
pleadings
still
they
kept
their
faith
and
reared
their
shapely
mounds
to
meet
the
sun
with
his
first
glance
and
from
the
morning
breath
retain
their
fervency
till
day
was
done
from
out
their
number
some
were
set
apart
for
game
and
chase
the
buffalo
and
deer
and
wild
fowl
all
paid
tribute
to
their
skill
and
vale
and
forest
echoed
with
their
cheer
but
one
of
these
young
wabun
shunned
the
group
and
wandered
by
the
forest
streams
alone
some
called
him
dreamer
others
tried
to
win
his
mooding
back
to
mirth
but
there
was
none
that
seemed
to
reach
the
center
of
his
soul
he
joined
not
in
the
worship
of
his
race
and
seemed
to
be
so
distant
in
his
thought
that
one
might
search
the
pleiad
in
his
face
there
shone
a
star
upon
the
eastern
rim
so
suddenly
it
shot
upon
their
view
so
brilliant
and
so
placid
never
dim
through
storm
and
starlight
always
lit
anew
they
marveled
much
and
some
were
sore
dismayed
to
seek
the
portents
of
this
stranger
star
but
not
so
wabun
he
all
unafraid
hailed
it
as
answer
from
the
dim
afar
and
showed
unwonted
pleasure
at
its
sight
his
distance
seemed
to
shorten
and
his
mind
seemed
mellowed
by
a
love
to
man
a
quickened
tenderness
to
help
his
kind
i
wander
in
the
forest
by
the
stream
they
gave
earnest
audience
as
he
spake
and
underneath
the
stars
and
they
all
tell
the
story
of
a
great
forgotten
god
i
listen
to
the
murmuring
of
the
rain
and
to
the
mighty
thunder
of
the
clouds
and
see
the
forked
lightning
in
its
gleam
strike
the
great
oak
to
shivers
in
its
path
i
see
the
maize
upon
a
thousand
fields
i
see
the
goodly
carpet
on
the
earth
and
every
grassy
thread
a
miracle
i
see
the
sun
upon
his
track
of
light
the
moon
upon
her
pathway
in
the
sky
and
all
do
tell
of
this
forgotten
god
for
god
is
of
the
living
not
the
dead
the
tree
the
sun
the
moon
the
stars
and
all
all
fill
their
places
but
are
not
alive
as
we
with
thought
and
purpose
and
design
but
each
doth
turn
upon
a
steady
crank
held
by
a
mighty
and
imperious
hand
the
bison
and
the
deer
and
all
the
birds
have
life
and
voice
and
action
such
as
we
and
yet
they
have
no
thought
except
to
live
they
build
no
houses
lay
no
harvests
up
we
are
their
masters
with
the
right
to
kill
all
things
pay
tribute
to
our
prowent
hands
all
things
we
see
are
provident
of
us
the
sun
to
ripen
and
the
moon
to
watch
the
birds
and
flocks
for
us
to
gather
flesh
the
forests
and
the
prairies
for
our
use
the
mines
for
metal
and
the
streams
for
fish
all
all
pay
tribute
to
our
wasting
hands
yet
we
are
not
a
law
unto
ourselves
though
masters
yet
not
gods
for
we
all
die
and
fall
back
into
dust
yet
are
we
great
and
greatest
of
earth
creatures
but
for
death
we
might
claim
highest
unction
but
our
power
is
limited
wherefore
if
we
are
highest
type
of
creature
earth
then
must
it
surely
be
that
god
is
man
but
of
a
higher
mold
not
subject
unto
death
but
lord
of
life
and
if
all
earthly
forces
must
conserve
our
being
highest
born
of
all
the
earth
then
back
of
us
the
great
creator
stands
unseen
as
is
eternity
unseen
but
felt
as
is
each
ripple
of
her
waves
upon
the
shores
of
our
unstable
life
the
greater
is
not
seen
we
do
not
see
the
very
thought
that
holds
us
in
control
thus
have
i
doled
and
pondered
on
it
well
until
upon
my
vision
dawned
that
star
and
as
upon
some
errand
quickly
sent
i
know
not
how
i
went
i
felt
so
light
i
sped
upon
its
rays
vale
and
hill
and
a
vaster
water
than
the
lakes
a
grand
expanse
of
green
and
surging
waves
and
on
still
on
till
just
before
my
face
a
mother
and
an
infant
at
her
breast
and
many
seeming
wise
and
stately
men
bending
in
homage
and
with
offerings
choice
of
vintage
then
i
sought
to
find
the
wherefore
of
this
sweet
emprize
and
i
was
told
this
was
the
son
of
god
the
one
that
was
to
come
the
mighty
one
redeemer
of
the
world
that
man
had
sinned
and
he
was
come
to
set
at
one
the
race
with
the
that
we
had
been
made
in
god
own
image
that
the
sun
and
moon
were
but
his
handiwork
to
him
alone
invisible
yet
always
looking
on
should
homage
be
ascribed
all
this
was
short
yet
was
it
printed
on
my
pliant
breast
and
can
not
be
erased
i
seek
no
name
and
claim
no
higher
homage
for
the
gleam
vouchsafed
my
vision
of
the
mighty
past
and
prescience
of
the
future
tis
enough
to
know
my
steps
directed
and
to
feel
that
in
my
darkness
i
have
found
out
god
no
more
the
unknown
god
but
evermore
the
ripened
type
of
the
diviner
man
and
as
we
reap
the
tokens
of
his
love
remember
him
as
father
man
of
men
the
infinite
perfection
of
our
race
much
more
he
said
which
made
a
deep
impress
upon
the
hardy
hunters
and
the
less
were
those
who
gave
no
sanction
to
his
word
the
greater
portion
followed
him
in
thought
and
soon
in
deed
the
votaries
of
the
sun
made
most
malignant
onslaught
and
they
sought
to
drive
the
thoughtful
wabun
from
his
dream
the
strife
was
vain
they
in
their
fervent
hope
turn
to
the
east
into
the
wilderness
the
grand
druidic
of
the
eastern
slope
and
hid
to
all
but
god
they
penetrate
the
deep
recesses
of
their
broad
estate
the
gentle
wabun
held
for
many
years
his
hand
upon
the
pulses
of
their
thought
sometimes
upon
their
love
sometimes
their
fears
his
fervent
purity
its
impress
wrought
he
led
them
to
the
thousand
untold
charms
that
sparkle
on
the
rugged
eastern
slope
he
bared
to
them
the
great
creator
arms
and
in
god
grandest
alphabet
he
read
their
highest
hope
niagara
was
but
a
giant
scroll
whereon
god
writ
a
token
of
his
strength
the
muttering
voice
of
its
unceasing
roll
was
but
a
cadence
of
the
mighty
length
that
measures
the
eternities
of
life
its
grandeur
but
one
glitter
of
the
gold
that
played
upon
his
vesture
that
the
strife
of
waters
was
the
stream
so
cold
down
which
humanity
as
rudely
rushed
without
a
thought
for
their
eternal
good
with
all
the
semblance
of
the
father
crushed
they
pass
down
in
the
surge
of
death
unceasing
flood
the
broad
atlantic
lashing
at
the
shore
was
human
passion
with
the
balance
gone
endeafening
the
graces
with
its
roar
and
blindly
lashing
the
eternal
throne
into
these
miniatures
god
thrust
himself
that
every
wave
might
glitter
with
his
name
that
every
rock
might
hold
upon
its
shelf
some
semblance
that
their
reverence
might
claim
the
kindlier
tokens
of
paternal
care
on
nature
face
were
beaming
everywhere
and
yet
how
few
of
us
can
truly
blend
the
creature
with
creator
in
our
sight
and
from
the
father
grasp
the
hand
of
friend
whose
stars
of
providence
outshine
the
night
our
eyes
are
fettered
with
an
earthly
bound
our
narrow
horizon
will
not
enlarge
our
gaze
star
fixed
will
drop
back
to
the
ground
and
will
not
with
the
infinite
surcharge
only
god
hand
can
push
the
barriers
back
and
give
our
vision
unimpeded
range
and
with
each
respite
on
the
weary
track
fix
the
unchangeable
where
all
is
change
return
and
strife
no
wonder
that
when
wabun
passed
away
their
torpid
natures
should
have
lost
the
charm
that
held
so
perfect
with
its
gentle
sway
yet
slacked
so
quickly
with
the
palsied
arm
infirmities
are
easy
to
impart
and
through
the
generations
they
come
down
but
god
must
place
his
hand
upon
each
heart
and
press
each
brow
where
he
would
drop
a
crown
long
brotherhood
of
forest
storm
and
flood
had
schooled
them
for
the
turbulence
of
life
the
wraith
of
nature
made
them
men
of
blood
the
war
of
elements
the
ocean
strife
the
thunder
of
niagara
now
heard
the
lashing
of
atlantic
on
the
beach
the
slogan
of
the
forest
in
a
word
the
carnival
at
rife
within
their
reach
all
served
to
spur
their
natures
into
storm
how
many
catch
the
of
their
song
from
the
surrounding
elements
and
warm
their
frozen
energies
and
make
them
strong
in
earth
unceasing
alchemy
much
more
the
untutored
savage
he
has
lost
the
key
and
must
from
nature
chalice
find
the
door
through
which
to
penetrate
life
mystery
and
many
generations
passed
away
since
these
stern
foresters
had
dwelt
apart
from
their
ancestral
brethren
till
the
day
when
in
their
higher
prowess
from
the
heart
of
the
great
forest
fastnesses
they
spring
as
panthers
on
their
unsuspecting
prey
they
have
grown
strong
in
weaponry
yet
cling
to
deity
in
their
untutored
way
the
happy
hunting
ground
to
them
is
heaven
and
the
great
spirit
still
to
them
is
god
yet
from
their
hearts
all
tender
passions
driven
they
smite
their
brethren
with
a
heavy
rod
a
long
and
ceaseless
struggle
many
years
alternately
invasion
and
defense
till
they
are
driven
southward
and
the
fears
that
kohen
prophecy
would
be
fullfilled
and
back
of
this
the
agony
intense
of
impotence
in
prayer
so
deeply
chilled
the
hearts
of
these
poor
children
of
the
sun
that
they
gave
easy
conquest
to
their
foes
and
thus
the
struggle
stubbornly
begun
so
unresisting
now
was
finished
without
blows
when
man
is
shorn
of
strength
and
there
is
left
only
omnipotence
we
kiss
the
rod
the
very
rod
that
smites
us
in
the
cleft
we
would
attempt
to
hide
from
deity
yet
in
his
anger
is
an
answered
prayer
the
consciousness
of
presence
though
we
flee
the
wrath
of
love
is
proof
of
constant
care
but
when
we
beat
against
the
empty
air
and
every
echo
sends
us
back
despair
and
even
superstition
fails
to
foil
our
souls
with
the
deceptive
glow
of
spoil
then
are
we
bittered
and
our
path
made
black
we
grope
in
mists
cimmerian
on
the
wrack
of
constant
and
interminable
doubt
a
natural
prey
and
easy
put
to
rout
to
south
and
west
they
turn
their
fateful
way
beyond
the
mississippi
and
their
day
seemed
lighted
with
a
new
influx
of
hope
the
sun
embraced
them
with
a
warmer
smile
the
mellow
fragrance
of
the
southern
slope
added
entrancement
each
succeeding
mile
not
all
at
once
the
exodus
took
place
for
they
were
many
and
had
scattered
wide
yet
to
the
southward
all
had
set
their
face
to
seek
in
other
fields
a
place
to
hide
from
cruel
persecutions
when
our
kin
lends
its
consanguined
arder
to
the
dart
how
more
intent
with
vengeful
purposes
how
heavier
is
the
load
upon
the
heart
they
scatter
into
fragmentary
clans
and
in
the
earnest
of
their
added
woe
give
birth
to
new
religious
phantasies
the
unclogged
streams
of
superstition
flow
when
down
the
mountains
and
across
the
moors
the
heavy
swollen
torrents
sweep
along
throwing
their
scattered
wrecks
upon
the
shores
and
breaking
barriers
however
strong
baal
was
great
when
baalbec
reared
her
crest
and
column
after
column
gave
her
grace
and
all
the
east
upon
her
beauty
smiled
but
when
the
owls
and
bats
usurped
her
place
the
god
had
fallen
in
the
temple
dust
where
man
with
his
immortal
had
so
strove
to
make
the
marble
animate
in
vain
like
other
myriad
phantoms
of
the
brain
time
fashions
into
ghostly
hands
that
sternly
point
above
and
so
god
reaps
involuntary
praise
from
every
fashioning
of
man
design
his
ways
indeed
can
not
be
called
our
ways
yet
his
hozannas
from
each
crumbling
shrine
teach
us
the
servitude
of
all
the
past
that
human
hands
but
fashion
heavenly
aids
that
every
sculptured
mythmark
only
fades
into
eternal
sunshine
at
the
last
some
crossed
the
mountain
ramparts
of
the
west
some
lingered
still
upon
the
eastern
slope
the
empire
yet
was
open
to
their
zest
and
all
were
buoyant
with
a
hope
but
war
like
pestilence
doth
warp
our
lives
and
like
contagion
it
infects
the
air
peace
comes
in
measure
but
it
never
thrives
directly
after
conflict
till
grows
fair
the
flesh
so
lately
scarred
intestine
war
made
ravage
of
their
ranks
they
ill
could
spare
their
bravest
yet
the
first
to
fall
in
fratricidal
jar
the
lines
by
conflict
soon
were
closely
drawn
and
from
the
night
of
struggle
nations
dawn
whose
chiefs
assume
the
king
prerogative
clans
fall
and
clansmen
perish
nations
live
that
pass
chaotic
conflict
and
ensphere
their
crude
material
as
a
world
to
individual
phalanxes
and
rear
their
rude
escutcheon
as
in
ether
whirled
the
new
born
planet
tracks
its
trial
course
so
must
this
human
query
find
its
way
and
failure
is
its
fashion
but
still
worse
are
those
who
fail
to
grapple
with
the
day
but
look
supinely
on
while
vested
rights
are
trampled
under
foot
and
raise
no
hand
in
deprecating
gesture
from
the
heights
of
grim
impartial
history
will
stand
unfading
letters
written
to
the
shame
of
those
whose
scourges
fail
to
make
a
name
prehistoric
rendezvous
of
the
aztecs
on
either
side
the
crest
of
the
madre
where
mountains
kiss
their
hands
to
either
sea
one
slope
to
blush
upon
the
opening
day
the
other
to
drop
down
its
tapestry
and
hold
the
hand
for
promise
of
return
three
nations
as
three
stars
to
being
burn
the
toltecs
purest
of
the
primal
race
the
chichamecs
devoted
to
the
chase
and
aztecs
strongest
in
the
arts
of
war
all
seeming
thrown
beneath
one
fateful
star
no
painter
limnes
upon
his
labored
scroll
be
it
fantastic
feast
or
forest
shades
as
war
upon
its
victims
from
the
soul
plastic
as
new
damped
clay
it
never
fades
till
time
has
ironed
out
the
furrowed
past
and
peace
by
laying
fevered
brows
to
rest
over
the
present
has
its
mantle
cast
then
nature
folds
its
wardling
to
its
breast
so
on
these
nations
had
been
writ
in
brief
the
liturgy
of
hardened
strife
and
through
the
furnace
of
their
pungent
grief
they
learn
to
plant
the
rootlets
of
their
life
one
thing
is
never
lacking
at
the
time
when
in
their
nascent
passions
nations
rise
the
craft
of
priests
in
every
age
and
clime
to
point
a
moral
or
portend
the
skies
and
so
from
altars
to
the
sun
new
pleadings
to
new
conjured
gods
arose
the
selfish
passions
since
the
world
begun
all
seek
supernal
outlet
on
their
foes
one
thing
not
far
from
truth
grew
into
form
the
thought
of
one
great
universal
heart
that
beat
against
the
window
pane
of
thought
and
formed
of
all
existences
a
part
how
near
the
passions
of
mankind
will
verge
sometimes
upon
the
borderland
of
bliss
and
all
the
race
is
bettered
if
they
urge
continuous
march
nor
turn
their
steps
amiss
a
little
light
would
lead
them
on
to
god
and
lacking
it
the
race
for
ages
plod
o
that
the
infant
eye
of
every
race
might
recognize
at
once
the
master
face
all
brought
their
tribute
to
tonatiuh
shrine
still
burnishing
the
sun
with
rays
divine
true
worship
strengthens
in
the
wake
of
years
its
song
grows
rhythmal
with
repeated
chant
its
beauty
lingers
though
it
disappears
rekindle
and
it
melts
the
adamant
but
worship
on
a
purely
human
base
though
it
may
work
its
legends
into
song
and
deify
the
noblest
of
its
race
can
never
be
unquestionably
strong
the
happenings
of
nature
clog
its
wheels
the
elements
brush
down
its
cobweb
foils
and
from
its
mimicry
the
heart
appeals
and
heavenly
souls
are
not
for
human
toils
it
is
impossible
to
still
the
brain
by
merely
human
fiat
at
it
thrust
man
journeys
out
and
he
returns
again
the
father
voice
alone
can
call
him
from
the
dust
and
yet
each
effort
of
the
human
soul
to
force
existence
for
its
latent
wings
is
of
an
energy
that
leaps
control
whose
germ
from
our
immortal
nature
springs
the
very
of
the
eternal
realm
though
touched
in
ignorance
commands
the
door
a
more
than
human
wisdom
guides
the
helm
as
we
approach
the
shore
the
hungry
arms
that
reach
out
after
god
are
as
the
infants
for
the
parent
breast
the
soul
is
weary
of
its
fruitless
plod
and
nature
beckons
it
to
perfect
rest
what
though
the
stream
be
poisoned
if
its
flow
seeks
only
the
great
ocean
to
be
lost
not
long
upon
its
bosom
is
it
tossed
ere
it
recovers
its
old
healthful
glow
the
sparkle
of
the
mountain
spring
gleams
in
the
that
returns
to
earth
no
poison
lurks
within
the
second
birth
it
ever
carries
healing
on
its
wing
thus
the
soul
may
find
its
way
over
the
wilderness
to
jordan
plain
it
shall
not
fail
of
its
eternal
gain
the
night
so
trackless
shall
break
into
day
the
saint
whom
angels
ushered
through
the
gate
with
pæans
of
rejoicing
once
did
grope
and
lose
his
way
and
loose
his
hold
on
hope
no
soul
that
reaches
it
is
told
to
wait
god
waits
upon
the
effort
to
reply
and
seeing
human
hands
stretch
out
for
aid
his
stronger
palm
is
soon
upon
them
laid
our
weakness
is
the
signet
he
can
not
deny
the
toltecs
journey
south
the
toltecs
were
the
first
to
break
the
way
toward
the
vertex
of
the
summer
sun
to
catch
the
fervor
of
his
ripest
ray
and
talismise
the
pilgrimage
begun
and
after
many
days
their
fasting
eyes
are
feasted
with
mexitli
a
lovely
plain
so
like
a
paradise
an
almost
eden
sprung
to
life
again
her
placid
lakes
gave
back
her
deep
blue
sky
in
rivalry
of
nature
nature
charms
do
cast
reflected
multiples
and
try
to
fold
us
in
with
her
unnumbered
arms
not
all
we
see
but
all
we
feel
invites
together
with
our
seeing
to
secure
an
unrestricted
homage
all
unite
in
this
uncovered
world
so
rich
and
pure
and
lade
with
sunshine
ripened
into
form
concentered
rays
to
leaves
and
blossoms
grown
the
larch
impendent
with
its
verdant
cone
the
oak
historic
battlement
of
storm
the
cypress
mourning
and
exultant
palms
the
provident
maguey
whose
offered
alms
found
ready
acceptation
at
their
hands
the
maize
which
they
had
known
in
northern
lands
were
native
to
her
rich
and
virgin
soil
and
gave
the
husbandman
unstinted
spoil
and
thus
with
nature
and
themselves
at
rest
fresh
inspiration
from
the
god
of
peace
expands
and
energizes
every
breast
and
fettered
manhood
labors
for
release
invention
is
emancipation
time
doth
loosen
nature
fetters
man
invents
not
one
of
those
discoveries
sublime
that
couples
his
poor
name
with
consequence
the
world
had
moved
a
million
years
or
so
ere
galileo
blundered
into
prison
for
telling
how
we
are
compelled
to
go
the
fog
of
superstition
had
not
risen
and
he
whose
brain
peered
up
above
the
cloud
to
widen
the
horizon
of
his
thought
must
be
content
to
leave
the
gnarlish
crowd
of
puppets
and
of
priestcraft
who
have
fought
the
van
of
progress
immemorial
time
in
fear
some
newly
loosened
truth
might
break
some
preconcerted
dogma
deeming
crime
the
impulsive
movement
of
the
soul
to
slake
the
thirst
that
god
implanted
there
to
burn
its
way
into
the
hidden
and
unseen
and
find
new
thoroughfares
for
its
return
and
on
creation
outer
verge
new
entities
to
glean
so
did
these
primal
pioneers
look
out
beyond
the
compass
of
their
husbandry
and
challenge
their
surroundings
manly
stout
and
earnest
did
they
seek
the
mystic
tree
of
knowledge
in
this
eden
of
the
west
not
interdicted
by
divine
decree
but
always
open
to
the
manly
quest
and
the
unflagging
purpose
to
be
free
the
zodiac
gave
up
its
lettered
scroll
to
their
inquiries
and
the
measured
year
unsealed
the
clasp
that
held
it
from
control
and
truths
that
had
seemed
very
far
revealed
themselves
quite
near
their
rudely
fashioned
lodges
soon
gave
way
to
buildings
of
a
more
pretentious
form
the
forests
and
the
quarries
and
the
clay
were
forced
to
human
vassalage
the
charm
that
held
the
forest
templary
from
spoil
was
not
entirely
broken
after
years
and
christian
conquest
must
consume
the
toil
and
travail
of
the
centuries
our
tears
are
but
a
poor
atonement
for
the
brand
our
westward
march
has
made
on
nature
back
we
mourn
our
forest
fastnesses
too
late
with
hand
unbridled
we
have
torn
their
face
and
given
legal
sanction
to
their
fate
but
what
companionship
can
take
their
place
nearest
to
nature
very
heart
of
hearts
the
verdant
monarchs
beckon
us
to
god
their
benison
with
life
alone
departs
they
testify
of
eden
from
the
sod
o
man
that
thy
perfection
should
be
lost
when
so
much
perfectness
is
left
on
earth
how
much
of
bitterness
with
what
a
cost
didst
thou
forget
the
sacred
touch
that
hallowed
thee
at
birth
the
worship
of
hurakin
heart
of
heaven
spoke
of
a
healthier
higher
growth
of
soul
the
consciousness
of
sins
to
be
forgiven
a
god
whom
weakness
could
at
once
control
a
prophecy
of
fatherhood
to
come
a
ray
that
pencils
from
the
great
white
throne
a
voice
to
energies
that
had
been
dumb
for
many
centuries
prophetic
groan
of
man
insatiate
thirst
for
betterment
not
all
in
vain
the
dove
of
peace
for
many
years
was
theirs
they
came
and
went
beyond
their
borders
without
let
or
lease
found
sunnier
climes
to
south
and
as
a
charm
was
laid
upon
their
footsteps
they
advance
to
hover
closer
to
their
ancient
god
they
still
were
pliant
to
his
fateful
glance
and
scanned
his
burnished
surface
to
inquire
his
potency
in
human
destiny
they
had
forgot
the
legend
of
his
fire
yet
from
his
searching
steadfast
eye
not
one
of
them
were
free
so
pass
they
out
from
the
historic
ken
theirs
no
aggressive
on
the
earth
we
linger
on
their
passage
and
the
pen
would
gladly
pour
regret
upon
the
dearth
of
the
indentures
they
have
left
to
mark
their
peaceful
noiseless
tread
upon
the
shore
but
it
is
vain
yet
out
of
all
this
dark
one
lesson
may
we
glean
that
evermore
the
souls
that
move
with
nature
on
her
march
are
those
who
drop
as
she
drops
down
her
leaves
they
fill
the
earth
with
fruitfulness
and
arch
the
highway
of
the
nations
with
their
sheaves
they
sleep
to
history
but
wake
to
god
theirs
is
the
through
eternal
gates
they
write
no
vengeful
sanscrit
on
the
sod
they
linger
at
no
earthly
court
but
the
recording
seraph
waits
to
write
them
blessed
of
the
lord
the
jewels
of
the
fates
the
aztecs
aztlan
the
silver
current
of
the
upper
grande
and
where
the
gila
penetrates
the
east
the
zuni
lines
its
rocky
bed
with
sand
new
ground
from
granite
that
has
been
released
from
mountain
base
the
vertebrate
madre
breaks
into
several
of
spine
which
form
the
watershed
that
feeds
the
sea
on
either
side
the
sunny
slopes
recline
where
coronado
laid
in
after
years
the
scepter
of
his
sovereign
and
bespoke
the
unbroke
silence
as
the
cycle
nears
the
bending
of
the
neck
to
hispagniola
yoke
here
was
the
fabled
aztlan
and
the
race
whose
ancestry
had
circled
half
the
globe
have
now
their
latest
destiny
to
face
o
could
they
peer
the
darkness
through
and
probe
the
deep
recesses
of
impending
time
look
for
one
moment
on
what
was
to
be
how
would
they
cling
to
this
rude
mountain
clime
and
bar
the
door
of
their
futurity
the
aztecs
were
a
proud
and
prowent
race
in
the
dispersal
at
the
far
northeast
now
many
years
they
held
the
leading
place
yet
in
their
husbandry
they
were
the
least
their
hands
were
skilled
to
turbulence
and
strife
the
bow
the
lance
and
the
rude
hunter
knife
such
were
their
ready
implements
but
peace
found
them
all
unacquainted
her
surcease
requires
a
range
of
weaponry
diverse
the
hands
that
hew
down
others
lips
that
curse
both
must
be
newly
christened
and
the
arts
that
unify
the
race
with
nature
ways
must
hard
their
hands
and
reimburse
their
hearts
and
time
their
lips
with
sunnier
kinds
of
lays
as
if
to
fill
the
interim
there
grew
from
their
own
ranks
the
fittest
kind
of
guide
a
pastoral
leader
who
by
instinct
knew
the
flowery
paths
that
lead
on
either
side
the
verdant
fields
of
husbandry
and
thrift
the
worthy
moctheuzoma
b
had
this
gift
and
led
them
to
the
conquest
of
the
soil
that
easy
conquering
that
seeks
its
spoil
only
where
god
intended
it
for
man
the
fruits
of
his
own
labor
thus
began
an
era
of
that
led
the
aztecs
on
to
greatness
and
that
shed
a
tender
halo
over
after
years
when
memory
will
mingle
with
our
tears
he
turned
their
eyes
upon
the
talcite
ledge
and
said
behold
this
is
tonatuah
pledge
of
providence
against
the
summer
heat
and
the
cold
frosts
of
winter
quarry
it
and
fashion
it
for
framework
to
your
homes
for
centuries
it
has
withstood
the
storm
to
wait
upon
your
coming
let
your
feet
be
busy
with
its
treasures
then
he
turned
to
where
the
clay
for
years
had
been
inurned
and
said
make
use
of
this
is
thaloc
c
gift
the
mighty
thunderer
hath
torn
it
down
and
ground
it
into
ashes
for
your
use
mold
it
in
shapely
fragments
and
the
sun
the
tonatuah
will
pour
out
his
warmest
rays
to
bake
it
back
to
stone
and
more
this
pliant
clay
has
aptitudes
for
vessels
of
all
kinds
and
yours
are
rude
so
in
a
hundred
ways
you
may
improve
then
pointing
to
the
forest
thus
he
spoke
there
tonatu
and
thaloc
both
did
shake
their
branches
to
the
earth
for
us
that
we
might
gather
fruit
for
any
taste
these
noble
trees
have
swelled
the
turf
for
years
and
now
will
bend
the
neck
for
our
support
we
must
be
provident
for
they
do
point
their
myriad
fingers
to
the
hands
that
gave
mute
monitors
to
beckon
us
of
heaven
the
fish
and
fowl
and
all
the
vast
menage
that
track
our
mountain
slopes
are
all
our
own
but
look
out
on
the
earth
whose
grassy
turf
lifts
up
its
thousand
homages
to
heaven
whence
must
we
gather
fruit
of
our
own
toil
the
maize
will
grow
if
planted
the
legume
will
ripen
and
our
hands
will
surely
fill
if
we
but
ask
the
earth
and
gods
to
help
and
second
our
endeavors
we
must
work
the
river
from
the
mountain
rushes
on
the
mountain
shakes
its
thousand
plumes
at
her
the
stars
do
not
keep
quiet
in
the
skies
all
nature
is
alert
and
on
the
watch
and
man
must
bear
his
burden
at
the
mill
thus
did
he
lead
them
to
their
better
selves
and
ravel
out
the
intricates
of
life
in
wisdom
stern
and
simple
litany
gave
trenchent
lessons
to
the
man
and
wife
and
scattered
homes
upon
new
harvest
fields
and
he
who
sets
a
household
altar
up
and
sanctifies
it
with
the
name
of
home
fresh
sprinkled
from
the
sacred
nuptial
cup
is
heaven
ambassador
in
human
form
the
hearthstone
is
the
herald
of
advance
the
hanging
of
each
homely
crane
like
one
of
god
unnumbered
irridescent
plants
sheds
rainbow
hues
on
all
it
shines
upon
and
blessings
bend
each
limb
upon
its
tree
thrice
happy
is
the
nation
thus
begun
for
it
has
found
the
track
of
destiny
the
mines
he
opened
and
laid
bare
the
beds
of
precious
minerals
that
underlie
the
bases
of
our
mountain
chains
for
all
our
wants
we
have
a
full
supply
thus
spake
the
seer
we
shall
not
beat
in
vain
against
the
bars
that
keep
our
souls
from
flight
our
birth
is
built
around
by
providence
our
wants
are
wickets
to
unmeasured
wealth
if
we
but
find
the
turnstile
to
the
field
we
have
but
half
the
hill
of
life
to
climb
the
other
half
fades
out
as
we
advance
when
we
have
toiled
out
distance
up
lo
we
have
found
the
summit
and
descend
thus
do
we
work
together
with
the
gods
if
we
but
do
our
best
it
is
enough
when
we
put
out
our
arms
they
reach
to
us
though
they
do
span
the
universe
to
meet
and
draw
us
up
the
shining
heights
of
life
so
in
our
daily
plodding
if
we
sow
the
gods
will
furnish
harvest
if
we
build
the
gods
have
made
the
quarry
and
the
clay
whatever
purposes
we
have
in
life
if
they
be
only
for
our
betterment
the
crude
material
is
at
our
hands
we
only
fashion
it
to
suit
our
wants
nor
is
the
measure
stinted
to
our
needs
but
all
our
vessels
fill
to
overflow
look
over
the
green
fields
great
is
our
want
but
greater
the
supply
on
every
hand
the
wild
flowers
lift
their
heads
and
what
are
these
but
kisses
thrown
from
heaven
to
win
us
back
our
appetites
are
but
our
weaker
parts
and
easy
satisfied
not
so
our
souls
they
have
external
longings
to
supply
and
all
that
beautifies
and
brightens
earth
are
forecasts
of
a
kingdom
yet
to
come
as
on
earth
surface
may
be
found
the
flowers
so
underneath
the
shining
metals
are
the
surplus
of
a
generous
providence
our
fathers
on
the
borders
of
the
lakes
did
fashion
implements
of
husbandry
from
inexhaustive
mines
but
here
we
have
in
lesser
quantities
much
brighter
ores
fit
mostly
for
adornment
and
exchange
man
is
not
satisfied
with
to
mouth
the
beasts
roam
through
the
forests
and
are
filled
and
therewith
are
content
not
so
with
man
two
worlds
break
on
his
vision
and
the
one
must
interlock
the
other
in
his
life
or
he
goes
blindly
out
into
the
night
and
it
is
well
earth
gives
no
perfect
rest
or
the
hereafter
would
fall
out
of
sight
man
is
the
one
ambitious
animal
who
seeks
for
empire
as
the
brute
seeks
food
the
tame
necessities
are
not
enough
but
all
the
precious
under
flowers
of
earth
must
fill
the
measure
of
his
discontent
all
men
are
not
alike
and
some
must
hold
the
fullest
measure
of
life
luxuries
these
pay
their
surplus
for
the
others
toil
with
them
the
shining
metals
will
be
held
as
medium
for
barter
and
for
trade
and
as
earth
decks
her
bosom
with
the
flowers
so
will
the
human
race
adorn
themselves
and
blossom
out
with
variance
of
gems
though
still
encumbered
with
their
ancient
myths
he
pointed
out
the
harmony
of
heaven
gave
why
and
wherefore
to
the
dread
eclipse
not
his
to
tell
them
how
the
earth
is
driven
upon
its
swinging
orbit
over
space
and
yet
he
measured
out
the
perfect
year
he
looked
stern
nature
bravely
in
the
face
and
seemed
to
question
her
without
a
fear
transcendent
genius
thus
to
grapple
truth
across
the
path
still
covered
from
his
sight
yet
is
she
merciful
her
name
is
ruth
she
never
perches
on
so
grand
a
height
but
she
will
answer
to
her
children
call
and
spread
her
wings
to
fly
to
their
embrace
this
link
was
never
broken
by
our
fall
and
writes
evangel
on
our
troubled
race
with
his
own
hand
he
led
them
to
the
field
with
his
own
hand
he
taught
them
how
to
build
he
showed
them
what
true
husbandry
would
yield
how
all
their
empty
measures
could
be
filled
by
wakeful
industry
well
pointed
toil
is
touchstone
to
earth
said
he
our
fathers
may
enrich
us
with
their
spoil
and
we
may
thus
evade
the
beaten
path
yet
lying
dormant
on
our
fathers
beds
our
waste
brings
want
upon
our
children
heads
far
better
that
each
hand
be
that
all
may
know
the
purchase
of
their
lives
he
loses
half
the
journey
who
goes
out
to
the
incertitudes
of
other
worlds
who
has
not
tasted
what
his
hands
have
won
on
this
his
trial
sphere
thus
in
words
and
earnest
deeds
he
planted
fruit
that
crowded
out
the
weeds
ruled
by
divinest
right
of
by
wisdom

the

they
more

the

the
corn
gave
recompense
for
their
banquets
were
provided
with
the
best
fish
from
the
ocean
fruits
from
every
clime
so
diverse
yet
within
such
easy
reach
the
tropics
and
the
temperates
enchime
with
all
their
plumaged
babblings
of
speech
and
they
interpreted
the
varied
whims
that
nature
holds
embryoed
in
her
breast
they
climbed
the
boughs
and
shook
her
heaviest
limbs
too
burdened
for
the
garner
to
be
missed
this
ancient
mother
never
yet
has
failed
her
children
in
their
earnest
search
for
food
she
may
be
panoplied
and
heavy
mailed
yet
does
her
larder
furnish
all
when
fully
understood
take
all
in
all
and
measure
by
the
test
the
stern
hard
test
of
history
and
we
find
that
aztlan
very
far
from
being
best
still
was
a
prodigy
that
she
was
blind
in
her
religious
ethics
none
deny
that
she
had
faults
no
champion
gainsays
she
lifted
bloody
hands
against
the
sky
she
filled
the
avenging
measure
of
her
days
but
god
is
god
and
man
is
always
man
and
earthly
judgment
is
at
best
a
snare
and
never
since
the
human
race
began
has
turned
to
heaven
more
piteous
despair
than
her
sad
eyes
burnt
out
with
agony
moaning
above
her
nation
and
her
name
the
bitter
monody
of
not
to
be
the
deep
humiliation
and
the
shame
that
sent
her
crouching
at
the
foot
of
spain
the
fairest
daughter
of
the
wilderness
without
a
hand
to
solace
in
her
pain
or
ray
of
hope
to
lighten
her
distress
could
she
been
gently
led
and
tenderly
to
higher
life
and
holier
resolve
had
charity
bent
forth
her
noble
sway
the
christian
graces
that
with
earth
revolve
without
the
wasting
friction
paid
their
suit
to
win
her
back
to
wakefulness
from
sin
how
would
she
compensate
the
victor
hand
and
kiss
the
rod
that
smote
with
its
regard
but
to
be
drawn
and
quartered
like
the
brute
and
made
the
sport
of
passion
to
begin
a
life
of
vassalage
with
such
a
slave
yclept
as
master
claiming
from
above
the
license
that
jehovah
never
gave
except
the
iron
hand
was
woven
with
love
it
is
too
much
god
justice
is
not
lame
hypocrisy
may
steal
and
wear
the
cloak
and
don
the
ermine
with
its
fair
false
claim
with
crucifix
and
litany
may
croak
but
time
it
and
it
falls
to
earth
like
judas
on
its
immolating
sword
and
it
must
learn
to
curse
its
hour
of
birth
it
is
the
pledge
of
destiny
the
stern
unwritten
word
the
landing
of
the
spaniards
the
courier
n
new
laden
from
the
coast
has
hastened
to
the
council
of
the
king
with
most
portentious
tidings
that
tell
of
boats
that
float
upon
the
wing
and
warriors
clad
in
shining
scales
the
monarch
hears
with
trembling
he
has
long
looked
for
the
coming
of
great
quetzalcoatl
and
though
he
felt
his
nation
to
be
strong
yet
had
he
feared
his
reign
would
be
the
last
the
oracles
had
read
him
overcast
with
some
impending
destiny
the
ruse
which
priests
have
always
found
to
compass
their
abuse
the
chiefs
of
church
and
state
are
all
convened
to
canvas
and
compare
their
theories
and
much
of
wisdom
surely
can
be
gleaned
from
these
counsellors
of
his
and
montezuma
o
is
the
first
to
speak
his
dark
sad
eyes
are
beautifully
bright
he
was
not
philosophic
like
the
greek
and
yet
his
words
made
glitter
of
the
night
we
swing
upon
the
hinges
of
our
fate
most
reverend
priests
and
worthy
counsellors
and
it
is
well
we
counsel
and
conform
our
future
to
the
fashion
of
events
the
rising
sun
has
sent
inquiring
rays
for
many
years
to
greet
our
coming
god
and
lo
he
now
turns
back
from
tlapalan
and
what
must
we
but
welcome
his
advance
ye
long
have
held
me
kindred
of
the
gods
yet
i
deny
me
what
your
partial
eyes
have
kenned
upon
my
unassuming
face
i
am
as
other
men
though
more
advanced
and
if
great
quetzalcoatl
takes
back
my
crown
i
bow
in
humble
vassalage
to
him
for
what
am
i
to
question
his
advance
a
moth
upon
the
torches
fervent
ray
an
anthill
at
the
foot
of
and
i
have
sometimes
thought
most
worthy
priests
that
we
have
drawn
the
lightning
from
the
cloud
by
a
mistaken
worship
of
the
gods
no
one
will
question
my
religious
zeal
for
i
brought
many
victims
to
the
block
but
human
blood
doth
have
a
subtile
voice
that
reaches
ears
our
eyes
have
never
seen
and
though
the
itztli
opens
to
the
heart
some
heart
may
beat
far
out
in
open
space
that
whispers
its
avengement
on
the
air
our
gods
have
brought
us
victory
is
true
and
yet
great
nezahualcoyotl
did
spurn
the
shedding
of
all
human
blood
to
gods
and
when
great
quetzalcoatl
was
on
the
earth
our
gods
were
satisfied
with
other
blood
the
angels
of
the
mighty
past
cry
out
against
the
damning
practice
why
not
now
for
once
and
all
wash
off
our
bloody
hands
these
human
cries
pierce
farther
than
we
know
these
human
souls
may
ride
into
the
sun
we
can
not
claim
his
broad
uncumbered
breast
to
the
exclusion
of
the
rest
of
earth
the
god
of
earth
and
air
may
come
to
judge
at
this
dark
moment
for
this
very
sin
then
let
us
look
him
boldly
in
the
face
and
if
we
have
offended
make
amends
if
our
mistaken
zeal
has
overdone
surely
his
heart
will
cover
up
our
faults
and
we
may
thus
propitiate
his
wrath
then
rose
the
ancient
high
priest
tlalocan
p
and
in
his
sternest
manner
thus
he
spake
great
montezuma
king
of
earthly
kings
the
heart
of
tlalocan
is
bruised
and
broke
to
hear
the
words
his
monarch
has
vouchsafed
such
sacrilege
belongeth
not
to
kings
great
huitzilopotchli
must
indeed
be
strayed
or
he
will
shake
his
thunders
on
the
earth
and
strike
the
aztecs
from
the
face
of
him
war
is
the
wastage
of
all
human
flesh
and
whether
man
be
stricken
on
the
field
or
with
the
sacred
itztli
offered
up
the
measure
must
be
met
with
human
blood
thy
empire
has
been
purchased
at
this
price
and
can
not
otherwise
perpetuate
the
earth
and
heaven
both
have
set
their
mark
upon
the
bosom
of
the
placid
lake
and
by
the
coming
of
those
fiery
stars
that
flashed
their
baleful
faces
in
the
sky
all
omenous
that
anger
brooded
the
gods
have
read
the
purpose
of
your
soul
and
thus
forwarn
you
that
you
must
retract
they
cry
for
victims
and
must
be
appeased
they
gave
you
conquest
without
stay
or
stint
when
you
did
furnish
full
to
their
desire
but
there
are
few
within
the
shambles
now
and
they
must
be
replenished
or
the
doom
that
has
forshadowed
on
the
eastern
sky
will
flash
and
fall
upon
your
naked
head
great
quetzalcoatl
will
come
and
strike
you
down
and
grind
you
into
ashes
in
his
wrath
then
spoke
the
sturdy
counselor
teuhtlile
q
tlalocan
holds
the
nearest
place
to
heaven
and
in
his
zeal
doth
sound
the
ready
key
that
rhythms
with
your
empire
we
must
suit
our
action
with
his
words
or
we
are
lost
these
warriors
must
be
met
with
alms
the
gods
must
be
appeased
with
fresh
supplies
let
me
myself
go
down
upon
the
coast
and
with
our
ready
painters
bring
you
back
a
full
account
of
what
we
look
upon
and
if
perchance
these
be
the
van
of
him
whose
coming
we
have
watched
these
many
years
then
will
we
counsel
further
the
emprise
and
in
the
watch
and
wake
of
all
events
be
not
but
forestall
the
time
your
counsel
has
the
sanction
it
desires
i
would
not
measure
lances
with
the
gods
the
monarch
answered
in
the
dust
i
bend
and
plead
the
weakness
of
a
human
heart
the
south
shall
furnish
victims
for
the
block
and
teuhtlile
shall
repair
him
to
the
coast
the
dread
monition
of
the
flaming
stars
may
be
evaded
with
our
ready
zest
our
gold
and
precious
stones
with
lavish
hand
shall
be
poured
out
to
coy
them
from
our
track
for
what
are
all
the
earth
indulgences
against
the
smiling
favor
of
the
gods
repair
thou
to
the
coast
my
good
teuhtlile
with
plenteous
retinue
and
goodly
stores
with
cotton
fabrics
of
the
latest
cast
with
shields
and
cuirasses
inlaid
with
gold
the
burnished
mirror
of
the
fervent
sun
the
silver
shining
circlet
of
the
moon
with
robes
of
made
rich
with
pearls
and
other
trophies
that
your
tact
shall
find
receive
them
kindly
as
becomes
their
state
and
let
thy
wisdom
gather
in
the
full
their
purpose
and
intent
upon
our
land
it
may
fall
out
they
are
as
other
men
unsanctioned
at
the
chambers
of
the
gods
yet
must
our
moderation
pave
the
way
till
we
have
fully
compassed
their
intent
so
said
so
done
the
embassy
went
forth
to
meet
the
wily
spaniard
on
the
coast
they
little
dreamed
of
what
a
forest
fox
they
had
to
meet
they
little
knew
the
boast
that
hung
upon
the
challenge
of
their
fate
their
superstitions
made
them
ready
prey
they
opened
wide
their
hospitable
gate
and
gave
the
jewel
of
their
life
away
it
mattered
little
how
they
forced
it
back
and
tried
to
parley
with
their
destiny
the
hungry
lion
was
upon
their
track
and
they
were
lost
forever
and
for
aye
done
in
the
name
of
christ
oh
spare
the
word
let
not
the
nazarene
be
buffeted
gold
was
the
souvenir
the
pitying
lord
was
with
this
nation
just
as
deeply
bled
their
superstitions
were
the
ready
springs
the
spaniards
played
upon
to
break
their
hearts
deceit
as
damnable
as
serpents
stings
barbed
with
its
cruel
spines
their
poisoned
darts
the
embassy
returned
and
others
went
still
could
they
not
force
back
this
coming
cloud
the
steady
purpose
and
the
black
intent
that
wove
with
cunning
fingers
at
their
shroud
had
spain
come
as
the
pilgrims
at
cape
cod
or
penn
upon
the
delaware
to
lead
the
aztec
back
to
fatherhood
and
god
and
let
their
sturdy
manhood
for
them
plead
how
ready
could
their
faces
been
upturned
and
hearts
been
melted
into
christian
mold
the
brand
of
hell
was
on
their
bare
backs
burned
and
they
were
ground
to
ashes
for
their
gold
did
christ
suffer
such
supreme
disgrace
or
on
the
cross
or
in
gethsemane
did
heavier
drops
of
blood
stand
on
his
face
than
there
were
forced
by
this
foul
treachery
oh
how
the
patient
nazarene
must
bend
and
break
beneath
fresh
crosses
every
day
fresh
judases
betraying
him
as
friend
and
scorpions
to
sting
him
in
the
way
thank
god
the
time
is
coming
when
as
judge
the
man
of
sorrows
ermined
and
supreme
no
longer
as
a
packhorse
or
a
drudge
shall
hold
the
scales
and
watch
the
balance

how
heavy
did
he
make
the
widow

how

of

how
ponderous

a
pennyweight

how

the
little
things
of

prevail
the
spanish

sometime
will
be

you
will
rue
the

a

a
mountain
to
be

how
shall
the

fly
up
at
your
disgrace
how
shall
your
curse
a
hundred
fold
be
paid
and
what
a
glory

you
came
like
tender
shepherds
to
the
fold
yet
like
a
wolf
you
tore
the
frighted
flock
you
kissed
but
to
decoy
them
from
their
gold
your
seeming
calm
was
but
the
earthquake

your
empty
babble
of
the

but
the
mask
to

deceit

thy
treachery

sorely
pressed

thy
penalty
for
being

a
thousand

bony

their
accusing
fingers
in
thy
face
their

their

psalms

chant
in
mournful
cadence
thy
disgrace

of
the
spaniards
at

as
autumn

at

as
on
the
lingering
footsteps
of

a

mighty

at
his

went
montezuma
to
receive

guests
if
gold
be

then
was
it
truly
grand
the
royal
plume
upon
his
forehead
rests
his
feet
pressed
soles
of
heavy
beaten
gold
his
cloak
and
anklets
sprinkled
with
pearls
and
only
noble
hands
are
left
to
hold
the
blazing
palanquin
like
titled
earls
they
guard
the
skirts
of
royalty
from
stain
against
the
common
people
all
the
same
as
in
our
ripened
age
is
hard
to
gain
much
on
the
sodden
march
of
royalty
where
accident
supplants
all
other
claim
the
monarch
in
the
easy
prime
of
life
but
lightly
bronzed
the
glowing
mellow
hue
that
lit
his
cheek
seemed
borrowed
from
the
sun
and
shadowing
a
heart
that
beat
as
true
to
god
and
country
as
he
knew
their
names
as
any
monarch
that
wore
a
crown
his
welcome
like
himself
was
as
the
hardy
yeoman
bare
and
brown
he
felt
that
he
was
meeting
destiny
yet
to
its
solving
he
would
bend
the
knee
with
dignity
and
grace
not
turn
away
but
face
it
with
a
ready
cheerful
glance
and
meeting
night
surcharge
it
with
the
day
and
grasping
break
if
possible
the
lance
that
he
felt
sure
was
leveled
at
his
breast
he
did
not
know
the
inquisition
stood
with
rack
and
torture
at
his
very
gate
that
it
had
traveled
half
the
world
for
blood
to
whet
its
throat
for
bartholomew
and
came
with
ravening
appetite
for
him
those
wary
messengers
he
little
knew
or
those
brown
eyes
would
suddenly
grown
dim
and
the
warm
heart
would
furnaced
up
its
heat
and
he
would
grappled
at
its
very
throat
and
man
to
man
and
blood
to
blood
would
meet
and
not
a
plume
above
one
corselet
float
to
bear
the
story
back
of
it
to
spain
they
were
not
schooled
in
all
the
arts
of
war
nor
were
they
wise
in
all
the
world
deceit
yet
would
they
fought
beneath
their
fated
star
and
challenged
every
stubborn
step
though
it
had
proven
vain
but
in
this
fleecy
covering
the
wolf
so
hid
its
teeth
that
it
was
at
the
door
before
they
dreamed
of
treachery
the
gulf
lay
many
leagues
behind
their
foes
its
shore
and
all
the
distance
had
been
gained
by
stealth
tlascala
had
been
humbled
on
the
march
and
promised
spoils
from
montezuma
wealth
but
they
had
reached
the
keystone
of
the
arch
at
superstition
beck
the
aztec
gods
had
chained
their
valor
or
their
greater
odds
would
crushed
the
viper
as
it
should
have
been
and
left
it
to
a
purer
age
to
seek
a
common
kin
the
monarch
gave
them
hostelry
and
cheer
food
of
the
rarest
and
the
sparkling
pulque
and
quarters
for
their
troopers
all
quite
near
to
his
own
palace
gates
the
very
bulk
of
his
markets
was
thrown
down
to
their
repletion
for
their
loaded
board
they
fared
as
princes
favored
of
the
crown
of
all
the
best
the
kingdom
could
afford
the
fair
malinche
was
interpreter
and
montezuma
spoke
to
them
through
her
he
told
them
of
the
mighty
quetzalcoatl
and
how
he
recognized
them
as
his
kin
he
thought
he
had
their
history
the
whole
vast
riddle
of
their
ancient
origin
i
rule
a
mighty
nation
quoth
the
king
all
anahuac
is
subject
to
my
sway
and
yet
i
recognize
that
you
have
come
from
the
strong
palace
of
a
mightier
lord
to
whom
i
bend
as
subject
and
with
you
we
now
will
sway
the
scepter
of
his
will
we
long
have
watched
his
coming
from
the
east
and
now
that
he
has
sent
his
messengers
our
hearts
are
ready
for
his
wise
commands
we
would
have
urged
your
coming
on
before
but
that
we
heard
of
tales
of
cruelty
which
haply
we
may
now
believe
as
false
we
welcome
you
with
all
our
open
hearts
and
hope
you
may
enjoy
our
humble
fare
we
are
not
wise
as
you
are
for
our
lives
have
not
caught
wisdom
from
the
fountain
head
and
hung
upon
the
lips
of
quetzalcoatl
yet
are
we
cousins
in
the
faded
past
and
welcome
you
as
brothers
and
as
friends
how
caught
the
spanish
chieftain
at
the
words
how
did
he
gloat
upon
this
artifice
how
useless
hung
their
swords
that
they
should
win
a
nation
at
this
price
with
what
a
care
he
turned
the
dusty
past
to
cover
up
the
semblance
of
disguise
and
fix
their
superstition
still
more
fast
that
he
might
clutch
and
carry
home
the
prize
there
grandeur
in
the
tented
field
the
bivouac
and
the
smoldering
the
human
soul
unconsciously
must
yield
to
its
supremest
charm
where
man
aspires
to
meet
his
at
one
great
bar
and
valor
speaks
to
valor
of
its
claim
in
all
the
panoply
of
stubborn
war
and
drops
the
gauntlet
in
a
nation
name
it
may
be
terrible
but
it
is
grand
to
see
the
banners
flaunting
in
the
breeze
to
hear
the
bugle
blare
and
stern
command
and
see
opposing
forces
strive
to
seize
from
nature
stern
arbitrament
of
force
the
laurel
that
shall
deck
the
victor
brow
and
turn
the
stream
of
nations
from
its
course
the
cutting
of
new
sod
by
such
a
plow
may
tear
up
all
the
tender
ties
of
life
and
hearts
be
turned
to
ashes
in
its
path
these
are
the
ponderous
incidents
of
strife
and
made
legitimate
when
wrath
meets
wrath
but
when
the
assassin
creeps
into
our
hearts
and
draws
around
him
all
their
sanctities
and
he
becomes
a
parcel
of
our
parts
and
all
we
have
or
claim
are
made
as
his
what
human
brush
can
paint
the
upraised
hand
that
smites
our
confidence
at
such
an
hour
what
simile
can
human
tongue
command
it
is
indeed
beyond
our
mortal
power
we
talk
of
devil
but
the
word
is
tame
it
can
not
reach
the
climax
we
have
sought
it
only
frets
us
into
hotter
flame
and
beggars
all
the
litany
of
thought
i
do
not
claim
that
cortez
was
not
brave
nor
would
i
tear
one
laurel
from
his
brow
i
only
claim
he
stole
the
devil
glaive
he
held
it
then
and
let
him
hold
it
now
the
issues
of
their
lives
are
both
with
god
the
monarch
and
the
knight
the
flowers
of
charity
should
strew
the
sod
above
them
both
yet
cosmos
was
it
right
o
world
of
human
hearts
and
human
lives
was
montezuma
worthy
of
this
fate
o
world
of
husbands
world
of
tender
wives
behold
your
aztlan
bleeding
desolate
and
say
if
all
their
multiple
of
sins
though
they
be
blacker
than
the
blackest
night
were
worthy
of
the
end
that
now
begins
to
grind
them
down
to
powder
was
it
right
for
spain
to
steal
the
scepter
from
the
hand
that
held
it
out
in
welcome
to
their
doors
and
poured
their
treasures
out
as
free
as
sand
and
oped
with
lavish
all
their
loaded
stores
to
steal
the
key
of
superstition
gate
and
break
the
lock
upon
their
gold
and
fattening
at
their
table
steal
their
plate
and
feasting
on
their
lambs
to
steal
their
fold
to
make
a
prison
of
the
room
he
gave
in
which
to
hold
the
monarch
as
a
slave
o
pitying
god
thy
thunderbolts
were
scarce
why
crushed
they
not
this
farce
and
when
the
aztecs
goaded
to
the
quick
by
the
proud
insolence
of
such
a
horde
could
bear
no
longer
parley
but
were
sick
of
such
a
visitor
at
such
a
board
and
rose
en
masse
to
crush
the
viper
fang
they
bring
the
monarch
out
to
face
the
crowd
and
plead
for
their
immunity
the
pang
that
wrung
his
breast
for
he
indeed
was
proud
was
like
an
arrow
in
his
royal
heart
and
yet
he
prayed
for
their
forgiveness
then
and
like
a
martyr
bravely
bore
their
part
search
history
and
find
out
greater
men
and
they
are
less
forgiving
there
he
stood
his
nation
thronged
before
him
in
its
wrath
yet
did
he
plead
before
this
multitude
to
spare
the
serpent
now
across
their
path
he
could
not
name
a
promise
not
unbroke
he
could
not
offer
one
excuse
for
time
he
could
not
tell
them
why
to
hold
their
stroke
he
plead
for
hands
scarred
over
with
their
crime
did
ever
charity
reach
loftier
height
can
christian
spain
outshine
this
sad
brown
face
how
many
souls
in
christiandom
as
white
would
faced
his
countrymen
from
such
a
place
great
montezuma
where
shall
we
find
room
when
spain
has
such
a
multitude
of
saints
to
save
your
enemies
you
courted
doom
yet
would
not
kiss
the
cross
with
your
complaints
therefore
anathema
it
will
not
do
to
pass
a
heretic
at
heaven
gate
you
held
no
mumbled
crucifix
to
view
the
infallible
has
said
it
you
must
wait
wait
for
a
riper
age
to
touch
the
chord
that
quivers
all
unconsciously
your
praise
when
justice
draws
the
tardy
sword
and
earth
abhorrence
covers
those
old
days
with
its
repentant
ashes
then
my
king
may
rest
his
memory
upon
stubborn
facts
nor
minstrels
falter
when
they
fain
would
sing
their
elegies
implanted
with
acts
the
holy
inquisition
from
old
spain
and
bartholomew
from
ma
belle
france
the
hissing
fagots
of
sweet
mary
reign
these
million
martyrs
with
their
melting
glance
look
at
agony
across
the
sea
blind
in
superstition
groped
his
way
harmless
victims
and
much
misery
to
where
the
rays
were
slanting
into
day
in
europe
face
the
star
of
bethlehem
with
its
benignant
splendor
shed
its
light
but
the
groping
nomads
of
old
shem
lost
in
the
meshes
of
a
rayless
night
neath
the
palm
of
earth
philosophy
on
the
torchless
desert
not
a
star
to
guide
them
through

potent
mystery
bringing
all
the
wisdom
from
afar
though
montezuma
sins
had
cried
to
heaven
in
a
far
greater
stress
yet
what
were
they
paling
his
cruelties
and
still
forgiven
to
pour
out
greater
vials
the
next
day
o
spain
you
lent
the
sanction
of
your
name
to
cover
up
the
foulest
deed
of
time
upon
your
skirt
is
fastened
this
great
shame
and
nation
never
wore
the
brand
of
a
more
causeless
crime
death
of
montezuma
one
sad
sad
task
awaits
my
faltering
pen
and
i
have
done
one
flower
upon
grave
who
in
his
dying
could
alas
not
save
his
country
from
the
vulturous
maw
of
men
they
played
upon
the
monarch
with
their
arts
till
he
became
a
captive
in
their
hands
it
was
consistent
with
their
hearts
that
their
good
host
should
follow
their
commands
they
said
their
lord
across
the
sea
must
have
his
treasure
for
their
use
all
this
was
bitter
yet
he
did
agree
and
bent
a
patient
knee
to
their
abuse
they
struck
their
temples
and
the
red
right
hand
of
aztlan
rose
upon
them
they
could
bear
to
see
their
monarch
littled
and
their
land
made
tribute
to
a
stranger
but
beware
stern
warriors
of
castile
touch
not
their
gods
the
hearts
of
aztlan
are
but
human
hearts
and
at
some
shrine
the
whole
creation
nods
invade
the
sanctum
and
the
whole
man
starts
las

would
have
won
them
with
his
love
the
potent
key
that
opens
every
gate
let
not
deceit
claim
sanction
from
above
it
may
assist
upon
the
wheels
of
fate
but
what
spain
offered
through
such
legatees
was
worse
than
powder
on
the
bated
flame
to
gather
fruit
from
such
trees
was
worse
than
stealing
nightmare
from
a
dream
in
christ
good
name
they
stole
the
monarch
gold
they
changed
the
name
of
christ
to
treachery
they
gathered
all
the
spoils
their
hands
could
hold
and
pointed
to
their
master
on
the
tree
their
master
no
since
lucifer
was
hurled
down
from
the
shining
chambers
of
the
just
to
vent
his
spleen
upon
a
world
he
never
had
a
worthier
task
in
trust
than
that
he
gave
to
spain
inglorious
knights
to
rob
this
people
of
their
vested
rights
the
people
gather
at
the
palace
gates
and
vengeance
writes
itself
upon
each
face
their
generosity
no
longer
waits
they
spit
upon
and
spurn
the
outraged
place
it
harbors
those
who
wrote
themselves
as
knaves
upon
the
pliant
tablets
of
their
lives
and
now
the
incensed
nation
only
craves
deliverance
for
their
children
and
their
wives
they
know
the
belching
cannon
of
the
knights
will
make
sad
havoc
in
their
stately
host
they
know
that
spain
and
fate
unite
they
know
if
fortune
fails
them
all
is
lost
but
they
can
bear
no
longer
to
be
torn
and
swear
by
all
the
gods
to
pluck
this
thorn
the
spaniards
see
their
perfidy
too
late
and
call
great
montezuma
to
the
gate

are
my
people
here
in

welcome
guests

against

down

they
bent
before
him
reverently
at

it
was
a
moment

their
anger
burst
base
aztec
woman
coward
sneaking
slave
the
whites
have
made
a
puppet
of
your
name
talk
not
of
fighting
our
honored
gods
we
soil
their
sacred
robes
if
we
submit
a
cloud
of
stones
and
arrows
flew
the
air
and
montezuma
fell
a
victim
of
rage
and
despair
his
heart
had
broke
when
he
beheld
the
throng
for
he
was
burning
with
his
country
wrong
and
when
the
missiles
smote
his
fevered
crest
his
very
soul
was
reaching
out
for
rest
only
helped
to
roll
the
burden
off
so
long
imprinted
on
his
saddened
face
it
was
much
to
hear
his
people
scoff
he
fell
and
they
removed
him
from
the
place
he
never
rose
again
nor
wished
to
rise
he
made
no
effort
to
outlive
his
land
he
felt
weakness
and
he
heard
cries
he
saw
sinking
with
wasting
sand
he
knew
his
enemies
had
stole
the
garb
of
gods
to
fasten
on
him
their
deceit
that
they
had
stung
the
nation
with
their
barb
and
he
would
not
survive
its
sore
defeat
he
felt
their
scoffings
were
deserved
of
him
for
he
should
gathered
wisdom
with
his
years
he
saw
his
weakness
when
his
sight
was
dim
and
poured
his
wasting
moments
out
in
tears
they
called
the
priest
to
shrive
him
for
his
death
the
worthy
monk
olmedo
u
takes
his
palms
it
is
in
vain
his
very
latest
breath
repulses
all
their
uninvited
alms
he
dies
an
aztec
honor
to
his
name
and
spurns
the
symbols
that
have
crushed
him
down
what
mockery
when
he
is
all
aflame
with
their
abuses
give
him
back
his
crown
his
country
honor
and
its
gold
but
force
no
wormwood
to
his
fevered
lips
his
hand
is
pulseless
and
will
soon
be
cold
his
life
was
shadow
and
his
death
eclipse
great
are
the
consolations
of
the
cross
the
of
calvary
and
time
their
glory
compensates
a
kingdom
loss
but
piety
must
not
be
wed
to
crime
did
all
the
roses
blossom
from
the
cross
and
all
the
thorns
grow
out
upon
the
waste
then
were
the
metal
guarded
from
the
dross
and
every
crust
be
suited
to
our
taste
but
is
all
the
book
of
life
and
thorns
and
roses
crowd
the
tangled
way
and
good
and
evil
always
are
at
strife
night
always
dogs
the
footsteps
of
the
day
yet
figs
can
not
be
gathered
from
the
thorn
nor
grapes
from
thistles
says
the
patient
lord
one
great
good
life
like
a
new
angel
born
is
the
most
potent
sermon
ever
heard
the
hands
that
smote
the
monarch
in
the
face
did
honor
to
his
ashes
cold
and
dead
their
anger
was
rubbed
out
and
not
a
trace
was
left
as
with
their
slow
and
measured
tread
they
bore
his
sacred
ashes
to
the
tomb
within
the
walls
of
old
chapultepec
where
stately
trees
and
flowers
perennial
bloom
and
all
the
pulses
of
their
lives
in
check
bow
down
to
kiss
the
shrine
of
memory
the
sacred
hush
of
death
comes
none
too
oft
to
still
the
fevered
brain
and
make
us
free
it
is
a
gentle
hand
and
moves
so
soft
that
it
compensates
all
our
misery
by
chaining
all
the
lions
of
our
life
and
placing
durance
on
the
throbbing
drum
that
marshals
us
to
earth
unpitying
strife
how
should
we
reverence
the
hand
that
strikes
our
passions
dumb
cortez
and
montezuma
aztlan
spain
the
very
mingling
of
these
words
is
pain
the
one
bold
cold
unscrupulous
and
brave
and
making
of
each
obstacle
a
slave
seeking
glory
in
the
name
of
christ
to
gain
his
ends
unfaithful
to
each
the
fault
is
with
the
ethics
of
his
race
which
justify
the
means
for
end
and
leave
the
moral
aspect
without
place
and
to
the
foulest
acts
their
ready
sanction
lend
the
thought
of
holding
man
to
his
account
and
throwing
merit
against
circumstance
of
cleansing
souls
at
one
great
common
fount
of
holding
out
to
man
an
equal
chance
these
things
were
not
considered
in
the
least
the
glory
of
himself
and
spain
were
first
all
the
excesses
pardoned
by
the
priest
weaned
the
poor
soul
from
any
moral
thirst
a
golden
apple
trembled
on
the
limb
and
he
must
pluck
it
at
whatever
cost
what
matter
whose
it
should
belong
to
him
it
was
too
tempting
and
must
not
be
lost
the
wall
that
lay
before
it
must
be
scaled
the
owner
of
the
field
must
be
destroyed
and
if
his
in
the
effort
failed
and
must
be
employed
the
unbridled
passions
of
the
human
soul
linked
with
the
crucifix
in
his
emprise
the
lion
loosened
and
in
full
control
the
semblance
of
the
lamb
to
aztlan
eyes
a
faithful
offspring
of
the
papish
loins
the
features
of
the
church
in
duplicate
though
baser
metals
pass
for
golden
coins
only
earth
charity
can
make
brave
cortez
great
but
montezuma
conquers
all
our
thought
tenochtitlan
and
old
chapultepec
no
greener
shrine
for
memory
can
be
sought
the
heart
and
conscience
both
alike
bedeck
the
unfading
spectre
of
a
soul
sincere
who
tugged
at
destiny
against
the
dark
the
hand
unconscious
drops
its
laurels
here
his
brown
hands
could
not
helm
the
fateful
bark
against
the
baleful
breakers
of
old
spain
yet
who
proof
against
the
foils
of
men
his
life
is
but
a
psalmody
of
pain
what
soul
unmoved
can
touch
it
with
the
pen
the
link
that
bound
the
old
world
with
the
new
with
pure
and
patient

upturned

cloister
egypt

upon

denies
the

fills
the

with

nation

of

with

concerned

and
also
as
covering

period
subsequent
to
and
immediately
succeeding
the
conquest
to
the
student
of
history
malinche
in
her
position
of
interpreter
during
the
entire
period
of
the
conquest
presents
at
once
so
much
that
is
unique
and
charming
and
yet
such
a
sad
commentary
on
the
criminal
practices
of
the
sixteenth
as
well
as
the
nineteenth
centuries
that
i
have
often
wondered
that
a
stronger
and
more
practiced
hand
has
not
ere
this
claimed
the
privilege
of
championship
according
to
prescott
she
was
born
in
the
town
of
painnalla
province
of
coatzacualco
in
the
southeastern
extremity
of
what
is
now
mexico
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
cacique
a
sort
of
provincial
governor
and
prospective
heiress
to
large
estates
that
after
the
death
of
her
father
her
mother
with
indecent
haste
forms
another
union
and
in
time
presents
the
stepfather
with
a
son
that
they
jointly
combine
to
be
rid
of
malinche
whom
they
sell
to
itinerant
traders
and
to
cover
their
device
they
pretend
that
she
is
sick
and
use
the
child
of
a
servant
for
their
criminal
pantomime
the
child
dies
thus
completing
the
deception
except
the
hypocritical
mourning
to
which
this
unnatural
mother
is
said
to
have
been
equal
malinche
is
sold
by
the
traders
to
the
cacique
of
tabasco
and
reaches
maturity
about
the
time
of
the
conquest
she
seems
to
have
been
a
favorite
in
the
house
of
the
cacique
which
would
indicate
that
he
had
become
acquainted
with
her
origin
and
after
the
surrender
of
the
town
to
cortez
she
is
one
of
the
twenty
female
slaves
presented
to
the
conqueror
and
his
allies
either
from
enlarged
opportunities
or
her
natural
aptness
and
probably
both
she
is
found
by
cortez
to
be
just
the
person
he
needs
for
interpreter
mutual
attraction
leads
them
into
the
closest
relations
and
it
is
but
just
to
malinche
to
state
that
there
is
no
indication
of
her
knowledge
of
the
conqueror
wife
in
cuba
until
she
arrives
at
the
capitol
there
is
also
nothing
to
indicate
more
than
a
momentary
estrangement
between
malinche
and
catalina
catalina
lived
but
about
three
months
after
her
arrival
at
mexico
and
it
seems
that
malinche
assumes
the
same
relations
as
before
when
cortez
journeys
south
where
in
time
they
reach
the
precincts
of
the
nativity
and
she
meets
her
mother
after
all
the
years
of
their
cruel
separation
here
the
beautiful
sincerity
of
the
christianity
she
had
espoused
shines
forth
as
she
quiets
her
mother
fears
and
professes
to
doubt
her
mother
original
intent
to
sell
her
she
loads
her
mother
with
jewels
and
seems
to
cherish
no
feeling
not
consistent
with
the
warmest
relations
of
daughter
and
mother
the
statement
soon
after
is
that
cortez
presents
her
to
don
xamarillo
with
all
the
sanction
of
marriage
and
he
enriches
her
with
some
of
the
largest
estates
in
her
native
province
and
there
the
historic
account
closes
incidentally
it
is
mentioned
that
a
son
was
born
during
the
period
of
this
du
i
stated
that
the
historic
account
closes
here
but
charny
and
others
enlarge
on
the
traditionary
feeling
of
south
eastern
mexico
and
if
we
may
credit
his
statements
and
many
times
tradition
carries
more
heart
and
more
of
the
essential
elements
of
truth
in
it
than
the
cold
pencil
of
history
malinche
is
so
woven
into
the
social
structure
as
to
become
almost
the
patron
saint
of
that
part
of
the
country
and
prescott
rather
inclined
to
the
fruit
than
the
blossom
of
history
speaks
of
malinche
as
being
reverently
held
by
the
aztec
descendants
as
the
guardian
angel
of
chapultepec
i
have
endeavored
thus
to
present
the
salient
features
of
this
part
of
the
historic
drama
adding
and
enlarging
only
as
it
became
necessary
to
connect
the
events
and
do
justice
to
the
fair
subject
of
the
endeavor
and
whatever
criticism
may
be
offered
i
can
without
hesitancy
claim
the
credit
of
candor
and
a
desire
to
eliminate
from
all
the
facts
of
the
case
the
plain
unvarnished
truth
i
began
at
first
to
write
the
idyl
in
measure
but
soon
found
myself
cramped
in
expression
and
in
recopying
i
have
thrown
off
restraint
and
used
the
double
terminal
with
both
nine
and
ten
syllables
having
no
desire
and
finding
no
occasion
to
use
the
eight
syllable
measure
which
longfellow
has
so
immortalized
in
the
song
of
hiawatha
the
sacred
relations
of
man
and
wife
like
those
of
any
other
entered
into
voluntarily
are
no
less
binding
in
the
than
in
the
of
the
law
and
it
is
a
gratifying
truth
that
the
statutes
of
many
of
the
states
of
the
union
are
being
so
remodeled
as
to
recognize
the
rather
than
the
of
marriage
and
the
tendency
is
certainly
toward
the
correction
of
many
abuses
as
leading
to
a
more
enlarged
knowledge
of
social
responsibilities
as
long
as
the
sad
story
of
malinche
has
a
present
application
and
may
be
said
to
be
the
perspective
of
the
grossly
distorted
foreground
of
our
social
structure
so
long
will
its
rehearsal
have
its
use
in
the
world
and
i
only
regret
that
a
stronger
hand
and
a
more
perfect
pen
might
not
have
been
loaned
to
its
portrayal

hardly

he
passes
away

thus
the
perfect

childhood
stands
to
smite
at

evil

yet
how
is
it
cruelly
wounded
by
the
cunning
hand
of
its
kindred
she
is
sold
as
a
slave
to
the
merchants
whose
itinerant
traffic
encounters
this
cruel
and
conscienceless
couple
scarcely
five
years
the
miniature
maiden
when
decoyed
from
her
favorite
pastimes
under
guise
of
a
frolicsome
journey
she
is
hurried
away
into
bondage
to
gain
the
estate
for
her
brother
and
all
this
is
done
under
shadow
to
cover
the
basest
of
actions
malinche
is
said
to
be
dying
the
mother
is
bent
at
the
bedside
where
is
laid
the
child
of
a

it
dies
to
complete
the
deception
and

bewails
as
is
fitting
in
well
painted
actions
the
daughter
the
funeral
pageant
is
greater
than
the
one
attending

and
thus
did
the
misnomered
mother
strive
to
hide
the
print
of
her
sinning
how
fares
it
with
bonnie
malinche
thus
stung
in
the
morn
of
her
childhood
the
merchants
have
gone
to
tabasco
the
slaves
are
the
bearers
of
burden
the
maid
is
thus
borne
from
her
kindred
she
too
young
to
plead
for
ransom
little
heeds
the
force
of
her
venture
and
in
time
they
have
traversed
the
river
and
have
reached
the
town
of
tabasco
the
merchants
immured
in
their
traffic
sell
the
maid
to
a
wealthy
landlord
the
worthy
cacique
of
the
province
thus
cruelly
shorn
of
her
birthright
malinche
grows
up
as
a
servant
in
the
house
of
this
wealthy
master
the
playmate
and
charm
of
his
children
she
gathers
the
boon
of
contentment
with
the
easy
faith
of
her
childhood
her
mother
is
almost
forgotten
when
a
former
nurse
of
zunaga
having
served
the
time
of
her
ransom
has
sought
the
cacique
for
employment
she
knows
the
whole
piteous
story
of
the
maid
and
her
heartless
mother
her
soul
is
drawn
back
to
the
maiden
and
she
knows
with
the
whole
of
her
nature
that
this
is
her
old
master
daughter
and
malinche
across
the
threshold
calls
back
all
the
thoughts
of
her
childhood
and
each
feels
the
grasp
of
the
other
and
the
past
is
all
plain
to
malinche
the
noble
cacique
of
tabasco
heard
all
of
the
pitiful
story
and
swore
by
the
gods
to
avenge
her
of
her
cruel
and
faithless
mother
with
her
heart
as
hard
as
the
itztli

that
all

might
be

restored
to
her
birthright

like
the

when
they
shake
the
earth
with

surely
these
were
the
legates
of
heaven
great
quetzalcoatl
surely
fought
with
them
and
in
vain
was
the

endeavor
tabasco
soon
fell
to
their
prowess
and
they
must
now
purchase
appeasement
and
the
worthy
cacique
of
tabasco
forgets
all
his
pledges
of
ransom
and
malinche
is
one
of
the
twenty
of
the
maids
that
he
gives
to
cortez
as
pure
as
the
bright
water

bright
as

fresh
as

that
banquet
the
morn
in

isles
of

even
such
was
the
maid
of
painnalla
the
beautiful
malinche
cortez
has
been
seeking
a
sponsor
to
ravel
the
intricate
language
when
he
is
informed
of
the
maiden
and
she
is
first
brought
to
his
presence
a
favorite
child
of
the
household
she
is
robed
in
the
neatest
of
vestures
the
covers
her
shoulders
her
waist
is
enclosed
with
a
girdle
holding
skirt
of
the
finest
of
cotton
her
feet
on
the
daintiest
sandals
her
face
veiled
with
gossamer
pita
lends
the
highest
charm
to
her
blushes
with
aguilar
first
she
converses
he
had
lived
some
years
with
the
natives
borne
ashore
where
his
vessel
had
stranded
she
had
learned
all
the
various
shadings
the
many
and
quaint
dialections
of
the
several
anahuac
nations
and
not
long
till
the
noble
castilian
yields
its
palm
to
her
ready
conquest
the
mighty
commander
brave
cortez
with
his
piercing
dark
eyes
was
her
teacher
for
love
is
the
aptest
of
pupils
and
the
heart
is
your
ready
translator
the
words
of
the
chief
were
no
longer
the
meaningless
voice
of
the
stranger
but
the
language
of
spain
and
of
heaven
cortez
cast
a
thought
to
the
island
to
his
early
love
catalina
to
the
prison
of
fierce
velasquez
his
reluctant
marriage
in
cuba
yet
how
faithful
had
been
the
dona
and
never
yet
had
been
broken
pledges
of
perfect
devotion
but
the
morals
of
hispagniola
are
subject
to
easiest
bending
the
priest
giving
ready
indulgence
to
sins
that
are
nearest
to
nature
and
malinche
robbed
of
her
birthright
and
denied
the
boon
of
a
mother
had
only
her
love
to
direct
her
which
led
her
unerring
to
cortez
he
opened
his
arms
to
receive
her
she
the
purest
jewel
of
aztlan
and
as
moth
falls
into
the
torchlight
she
fell
to
his
brilliant
alluring
if
purest
of
wifely
devotion
with
its
love
that
is
of
woman
if
the
absence
of
wrong
intention
in
the
innocent
glow
of
nature
uninspired
by
the
shadow
of
evil
made
her
wife
she
was
wife
of
cortez
not
a
whisper
of
catalina
his
beautiful
wife
on
the
island
had
the
chieftain
given
the
maiden
and
she
felt
as
free
as
the
water
on
the
rugged
brink
of
as
the
bee
to
gather
the
honey
from
the
nectaries
on
the
mountains
and
the
multiple
bloom
of
the
valleys
she
thought
there
was
naught
to
prevent
her
from
her
lavish
of
love
on
the
chieftain
o
the
faith
that
is
always
faultless
that
ever
grows
up
toward
heaven
to
the
center
of
love
returning
whence
it
sprang
as
seed
from
the
godhead
how
its
track
is
hounded
by
evil
how
its
purity
pants
in
the
darkness
how
it
flutters
into
the
pitfalls
and
how
its
white
wings
are
broken
and
its
plumage
stained
and
bedraggled
but
is
only
the
earth
that
despoils
it
to
teach
it
more
earnest
endeavor
to
lift
the
wing
higher
in
ether
and
fix
the
eye
firmer
on
heaven
but
alas
for
bonnie
malinche
her
faith
had
no
heavenly
fragrance
except
in
its
helpless
dependence
it
knew
not
the
way
of
the
angels
but
groped
like
the
vine
in
the
cavern
always
reaching
out
for
the
sunlight
always
tender
and
white
of
fiber
and
the
worthy
father
olmedo
taught
the
maid
the
lore
of
the
ages
taught
of
life
and
death
and
the
savior
and
the
beautiful
boon
resurrection
and
the
story
of
magdalene
of
much
loving
and
much
forgiving
yet
he
whispered
naught
of
the
chieftain
and
the
maiden
lived
on
in
blindness
though
credos
and
ave
marias
fell
as
pearls
from
the
lips
thus
laden
with
the
story
of
jesu
and
mary
and
as
christ
touched
the
lips
of
childhood
and
made
them
the
text
of
his
sermon
the
innocent
sponsors
of
heaven
malinche
enrapt
at
the
story
shined
out
through
her
every
action
translating
the
life
of
the
to
speak
in
behalf
of
her
people
she
plead
for
the
chiefs
of
tlascala
las
casas
had
no
abler
ally
when
he
struck
the
stone
heart
of
cortez
and
the
stonier
heart
of
castile
in
his
earnest
prayer
for
the
aztecs
and
the
king
moctheuzoma
her
blood
gave
its
ardent
petition
in
behalf
of
her
race
and
her
people
her
bronzed
hand
pressing
the
balance
on
the
side
of
mercy
and
manhood
when
the
light
first
shines
in
the
cavern
damp
and
dark
with
moldering
ages
it
gathers
each
gleam
of
the
crystals
that
cycles
have
hoarded
in
brilliance
so
the
heart
groping
back
to
the
sunlight
over
graves
of
its
superstitions
throws
its
shoots
through
every
crevice
that
promises
health
to
its
fibers
thus
the
virgin
soul
of
malinche
the
image
of
god
on
its
tablet
made
the
glow
of
her
first
impressions
the
heart
and
the
soul
of
the
gospel
but
how
cunningly
clasp
the
fetters
that
fate
has
unconsciously
molded
and
yet
how
they
pinion
our
passport
on
the
trend
of
further
indulgence
the
conquest
was
hardly
completed
and
the
maid
in
the
fullest
enjoyment
of
the
treasure
she
aided
to
purchase
when
the
island
divulges
its
secret
and
the
wife
of
his
early
loving
and
the
wife
of
his
after
loathing
appears
at
the
door
of
the
chieftain
o
malinche
malinche
the
finger
of
fate
is
upon
you
the
wrongs
of
your
conscienceless
mother
were
the
scar
and
bane
of
your
the
years
with
their
velveted
footfalls
have
forced
them
far
back
in
the
shadows
but
here
comes
a
heart
that
is
bleeding
for
the
touch
of
its
earliest
treasure
with
an
even
right
you
have
won
it
upon
your
warm
bosom
have
worn
it
but
another
unknown
has
possessed
it
and
puts
forth
her
hand
to
recover
will
you
strike
at
her
just
petition
love
is
love
but
hers
is
the
older
and
it
has
grown
sharp
with
its
longing
the
hunger
of
years
is
upon
it
and
pleads
all
the
patience
of
loving
they
met
the
brown
maid
of
painnalla
and
the
pale
blushing
rose
of
the
island
malinche
and
sad
catalina
the
dona
gave
voice
to
her
murmur
in
words
that
were
pungent
and
bitter
reproaching
the
maid
for
the
beauty
that
had
stolen
the
heart
of
her
husband
but
malinche
returned
no
reproaches
when
she
heard
the
whole
truth
from
the
dona
but
her
tears
as
the
dew
of
the
morning
which
like
diamonds
filled
her
dark
lashes
smote
the
tender
heart
of
the
maiden
o
maiden
most
hard
and
unconscious
cried
malinche
out
of
her
sobbing
hear
the
bitter
tale
of
my
lifetime
and
the
heavenly
melting
of
pity
will
fill
all
the
place
of
your
loathing
then
she
told
her
the
whole
sad
story
how
her
cruel
mother
betrayed
her
how
she
fell
a
slave
to
the
chieftain
and
was
called
upon
to
interpret
but
the
heart
is
easily
broken
fair
maiden
malinche
continued
and
before
i
knew
i
had
fallen
and
i
hung
on
his
matchless
features
the
wonderful
glow
of
his
prowess
and
the
liquid
flow
of
his
language
till
i
could
no
longer
resist
him
i
thought
i
was
free
to
embrace
him
and
i
gave
my
whole
life
to
his
keeping
how
i
thrilled
to
his
first
caressing
and
panted
to
gather
his
kisses
how
i
hung
on
the
lips
of
the
morning
that
shadowed
his
life
with
new
danger
could
i
die
for
the
love
i
bore
him
i
would
pity
the
weight
of
the
casket
that
gave
such
a
featherlike
measure
could
i
stand
in
the
breach
of
danger
to
shelter
his
form
from
the
missile
i
could
mourn
that
the
father
had
given
but
only
one
heart
for
the
arrow
i
loved
him
i
loved
him
i
loved
him
and
this
is
my
furtherest
pleading
and
long
ere
malinche
had
finished
the
dona
had
mingled
her
weeping
and
each
held
the
hand
of
the
other
in
truce
of
their
worthless
repining
and
malinche
as
magdalene
would
have
washed
the
feet
of
her
master
but
the
dona
rather
preferred
her
as
companion
and
friend
in
pastime
so
they
passed
their
time
in
the
solace
of
a
friendship
closely
cemented
but
the
beautiful
flower
of
the
island
fell
a
prey
to
the
varying
climate
and
the
dormant
love
of
the
chieftain
she
pointed
her
white
hands
to
heaven
and
she
gave
back
to
mary
mother
her
tired
soul
as
white
as
the
snowdrift
the
busy
brown
hands
of
malinche
had
never
once
tired
of
their
office
in
smoothing
her
feverish
pillows
her
fresh
perfect
faith
pointing
upward
helped
to
pinion
the
soul
for
its
passage
farewell
to
thee
fair
catalina
though
you
tore
my
heart
with
your
coming
you
have
torn
it
worse
with
your
going
may
the
angels
shrouding
your
sorrow
pour
their
multiple
bliss
in
your
welcome
and
paradise
pant
with
your
beauty
and
heaven
as
white
as
your
goodness
shine
out
through
the
doors
for
malinche
for
i
envy
your
early
passage
and
would
gladly
have
gone
before
you
i
have
found
earth
love
but
a
fetter
to
cripple
the
wing
of
our
exit
and
after
he
humbled
the
aztecs
the
chieftain
soon
turned
to
the
southward
still
holding
the
hand
of
malinche
as
if
the
cold
palm
of
the
dona
had
never
intruded
its
presence
his
memory
cold
as
her
pulses
gave
hardly
a
throb
at
departure
but
malinche
wept
her
ashes
and
prayed
that
the
blessing
of
heaven
might
comfort
the
soul
of
the
dona
yet
she
held
not
her
hand
from
the
chieftain
though
she
chid
with
the
love
of
the
turtle
yet
her
heart
could
not
harrow
its
fallow
though
a
lay
in
the
effort
the
chief
guatamozin
who
succeeded
the
great
moctheuzoma
and
so
stubbornly
fought
for
his
people
had
fared
the
same
fate
of
the
monarch
except
that
he
gazed
on
the
ashes
and
saw
the
cold
ghost
of
his
nation
pass
out
through
the
gates
of
the
sunset
and
all
just
a
little
before
him
he
attended
cortez
on
his
journey
with
other
great
men
of
his
people
never
man
was
more
loyal
to
master
than
the
throneless
king
to
his
chieftain
to
the
cavalcade
came
a
rumor
that
the
life
of
cortez
was
endangered
by
a
plot
of
the
aztec
attendants
cortez
was
the
stoniest
master
to
the
knights
as
well
as
the
natives
and
no
wonder
his
life
should
be
threatened
the
scar
of
a
crime
on
our
nature
with
remembrance
of
wrong
we
inflicted
puts
a
double
watch
on
our
victim
we
are
prone
to
measure
in
manner
each
soul
in
the
pitiful
bushel
that
holds
the
shrunk
grains
of
manhood
and
cortez
turned
his
eyes
for
an
answer
to
the
plot
that
was
laid
for
his
footsteps
on
the
staunch
aztec
king
guatamozin
he
had
fought
a
brave
battle
for
aztlan
and
the
spaniards
had
felt
his
prowess
in
the
hardly
wrenched
sword
of
their
triumph
but
when
the
despair
of
his
nation
settled
down
on
his
heart
as
a
mountain
no
treachery
lingered
to
poison
the
flow
of
his
deeply
drawn
sadness
yet
the
wrongs
he
had
laid
on
the
people
stalked
out
as
a
ghost
on
the
chieftain
and
the
sad
eyes
of
poor
guatamozin
were
his
guilty
conscience
accuser
and
though
not
a
stain
was
upon
him
yet
the
chief
was
condemned
by
cortez
then
malinche
warm
heart
overflowing
when
she
saw
how
unjust
was
the
sentence
gave
its
plea
with
the
beautiful
pathos
of
the
life
that
is
simple
and
loving
though
she
was
baptized
as
a
christian
and
was
charmed
with
the
life
of
the
yet
the
water
the
priest
sprinkled
on
her
purged
not
from
her
veins
the
warm
aztec
which
charged
with
a
just
indignation
poured
out
on
her
chieftain
its
measure
as
a
faithful
god
is
my
witness
not
a
throb
of
my
heart
has
wasted
its
pulse
on
the
suit
of
another
since
you
glittered
my
life
with
its
purchase
i
have
loved
you
too
well
for
my
worship
which
has
hardly
a
god
but
my
chieftain
but
i
plead
for
my
country
and
people
you
showed
me
a
christ
that
was
loving
whose
life
was
a
psalm
of
forgiveness
who
touched
the
hot
lips
of
our
anger
with
the
tender
finger
of
patience
i
was
won
by
his
great
example
it
warmed
the
cold
stone
of
the
aztec
with
the
radiant
beams
of
the
morning
it
loosened
the
chains
from
the
ankles
that
were
swift
on
errands
of
mercy
it
tore
off
the
scales
from
the
eyelids
that
were
blinded
with
superstition
gave
freedom
to
innocent
victims
from
the
fearful
death
of
the
itztli
and
winged
back
the
soul
to
its
manor
from
the
desert
and
dust
of
the
ages
but
where
is
the
christ
you
were
pleading
the
merciful
god
of
your
banner
the
nails
of
the
cross
are
your
sword
points
and
his
pleadings
the
parent
of
carnage
his
merciful
words
are
but
margods
to
hurl
on
your
host
to
the
slaughter
as
i
pleaded
for
moctheuzoma
that
you
spare
him
the
shame
of
his
prison
so
i
plead
for
the
brave
guatamozin
though
he
fought
so
hard
for
the
aztecs
i
would
balance
my
life
on
his
honor
the
traitor
is
not
of
such
metal
at
your
front
in
your
face
he
may
strike
you
but
he
takes
not
the
night
for
his
helmlet
nor
is
treachery
ever
his
weapon
then
spare
him
my
noble
hernando
but
her
prayers
were
in
vain
for
the
victim
the
heart
of
cortez
was
relentless
and
another
brave
soul
winged
its
passage
to
try
if
the
gates
of
the
city
still
turn
for
the
broken
in
spirit
in
time
they
drew
near
to
painnalla
and
the
tale
of
her
childhood
confronts
her
though
she
hardly
can
call
up
one
feature
to
gaze
on
the
face
of
another
and
each
say
to
each
we
are
brothers
yet
the
story
has
lived
with
her
living
and
been
fanned
by
the
fervor
of
gossip
and
malinche
warm
heart
has
been
shaken
the
bitterest
brink
of
a
trial
her
chieftain
grown
great
with
his
conquest
thrusts
the
knife
of
his
pride
to
her
heartstrings
in
search
of
some
noble
alliance
and
she
must
be
weaned
from
his
wooing
as
only
god
lighteth
heaven
she
has
held
the
place
in
his
household
than
which
has
the
earth
none
more
sacred
yet
the
shade
of
the
poor
catalina
has
shown
her
how
weak
is
the
chieftain
and
the
bolt
is
thus
broken
in
falling
still
her
whole
heart
presses
the
balance
and
a
sacred
thing
was
her
loving
for
love
is
the
to
heaven
but
she
tries
to
force
back
her
sorrow
at
the
sacred
shrine
of
her
birthplace
and
the
angels
are
gentle
that
hover
at
the
rustic
shade
of
the
hearthstone
all
the
sorrow
comes
out
of
the
shadow
all
the
bitterness
bathes
in
the
sunshine
the
stubbornest
pangs
of
resentment
are
cooled
to
the
calm
of
forgiveness
and
charity
cradles
the
armor
that
was
harnessed
in
bristling
anger
her
mother
is
summoned
with
others
at
the
call
of
cortez
to
assemble
and
malinche
sees
mother
and
brother
through
the
soul
of
an
earnest
hunger
she
young
in
all
things
but
her
sorrow
and
with
only
her
nature
to
prompt
her
beholds
with
the
heart
of
a
daughter
the
mother
that
cruelly
spurned
her
in
the
fading
spring
of
her
lifetime
the
mother
as
ready
responding
to
the
tie
that
her
crime
would
have
broken
sees
her
child
like
the
face
of
a
spectre
rising
out
of
the
grave
to
accuse
her
and
in
terror
would
fly
from
her
presence
but
malinche
sprang
forward
to
grasp
her
and
forgetting
all
else
but
her
mother
poured
out
her
full
heart
in
caresses
saying
surely
my
mother
you
knew
not
when
you
sold
me
away
to
the
traders
surely
not
with
your
voice
could
you
sanction
your
words
would
have
frozen
together
and
not
with
your
heart
you
consented
the
blood
would
have
whited
to
marble
some
artifice
surely
was
practiced
my
mother
was
my
mother
and
though
you
unwittingly
sold
me
malinche
is
free
to
forgive
you
take
back
to
your
bosom
your
daughter
it
is
all
for
the
best
that
we
parted
for
it
gave
me
my
sweet
mary
mother
with
her
child
the
immaculate
and
better
a
slave
and
a
christian
than
a
priest
in
the
pay
of
the
temple
and
yet
how
i
longed
for
a
mother
to
show
the
clear
trail
for
my
footsteps
and
to
hold
the
white
hand
of
my
childhood
with
no
other
mother
but
mary
sweet
mary
the
soul
of
compassion
i
have
tried
to
grow
up
towards
heaven
but
a
mother
on
earth
is
the
blessing
that
can
never
be
held
by
another
our
flesh
will
not
float
on
the
pinions
that
bear
to
elysian
our
spirits
our
hearts
are
too
warm
for
the
angels
to
hush
with
their
transparent
fingers
our
lips
are
too
ready
for
kisses
to
be
cooled
to
the
calm
of
devotion
our
hands
are
too
warm
in
to
be
folded
in
supplication
too
much
of
the
earth
is
about
us
to
be
lost
in
the
halo
of
heaven
so
we
need
the
cool
heart
of
the
mother
that
has
passed
the
hot
chaos
of
passion
to
temper
the
pulse
that
is
wayward
yet
i
can
not
have
wandered
so
greatly
when
love
was
the
only
impulsion
such
a
distance
away
from
the
master
whose
name
is
the
essence
of
loving
but
he
sees
the
bare
heart
in
its
throbbing
and
the
crystallized
faith
of
my
footsteps
that
were
only
too
quick
in
their
choosing
surely
love
the
benificent
master
springing
forth
from
the
bosom
of
mary
to
smother
the
earth
with
caresses
will
drop
a
light
hand
on
the
shoulder
that
shadows
a
heart
that
has
wandered
by
only
its
warm
overflowing
she
loaded
her
mother
with
jewels
and
left
not
the
shadow
of
malice
to
stain
the
fair
skirts
of
her
mercy
but
canceled
her
wrongs
with
caresses
and
covered
the
past
with
forgiveness
thus
she
bore
the
whole
soul
of
the
gospel
to
the
hungry
hearts
of
her
people
and
the
heart
is
not
hard
to
the
sermon
that
carries
a
life
for
its
background
as
perfectly
pure
as
the
precept
the
heathen
is
waiting
the
harvest
only
hallowed
hands
for
the
sickle
when
the
life
and
the
lip
move
together
millennium
waits
on
the
morning
the
trial
that
sometimes
had
shadowed
comes
at
last
in
its
fullness
upon
her
and
the
pride
of
cortez
seeks
another
for
the
place
that
is
only
malinche
and
he
offers
to
don
xamarillo
the
tremulous
hand
of
the
maiden
as
if
it
was
his
to
bestow
her
as
a
chattel
a
token
of
friendship
on
his
friend
and
bosom
companion
the
anger
of
love
was
upon
her
and
all
of
her
beauty
shone
brightest
as
she
flashed
on
her
recreant
lover
the
flaming
scourge
of
her
protest
i
came
as
a
slave
to
your
you
lifted
me
out
of
my
bondage
for
you
knew
i
was
free
in
my
birthright
you
wooed
me
and
won
me
as
lover
and
only
as
wife
could
have
worn
it
i
have
drawn
on
your
love
as
a
garment
you
first
sought
me
out
as
a
sponsor
but
the
language
of
spain
is
a
magnet
that
drew
me
all
out
of
malinche
and
made
me
a
part
of
her
chieftain
and
now
you
would
sunder
the
tendrils
and
force
back
the
vine
from
the
branches
where
they
lear
all
of
life
in
reclining
and
never
can
unlearn
the
lesson
o
hernando
you
know
not
malinche
if
you
think
she
can
cherish
another
in
the
heart
she
too
willingly
gave
you
were
you
priest
of
the
aztec
temple
and
should
raise
in
your
hand
the
itztli
to
open
the
breast
of
your
victim
my
heart
would
leap
out
at
your
calling
e
the
word
of
your
summons
was
spoken
ask
me
to
anticipate
heaven
and
my
life
would
be
swift
in
its
forfeit
but
to
learn
the
love
of
another
and
to
wean
me
from
your
caresses
is
beyond
the
wisdom
of
granting
the
logic
of
love
hath
a
limit
only
god
can
our
oh
hernando
my
prince
and
my
primate
my
husband
on
earth
and
in
heaven
let
me
cling
to
your
feet
as
a
and
wash
with
my
tears
as
another
did
moisten
the
feet
of
our
savior
but
drive
me
not
hence
from
your
presence
i
can
never
love
xamarillo
he
can
fetter
the
hand
of
malinche
but
her
heart
will
go
over
the
ocean
and
will
smite
at
your
breast
when
you
proffer
your
hand
to
some
delicate
dona
not
alone
is
the
voice
of
my
pleading
but
an
angel
in
heaven
confronts
you
the
white
wings
of
sweet
catalina
shall
flutter
the
breath
of
your
wooing
you
sent
her
too
early
to
heaven
to
quiet
the
shade
of
her
anguish
two
wives
one
on
earth
one
in
heaven
throw
their
and
pride
in
the
balance
and
another
whose
innocent
glances
should
burn
all
the
dross
from
your
nature
your
child
is
a
witness
against
you
god
has
sent
him
a
pledge
of
my
wifehood
to
nail
the
black
lie
of
denying
though
no
priest
gave
the
mystical
signet
surely
god
heard
the
vows
that
were
spoken
when
our
hearts
took
their
place
at
the
wedding
and
who
shall
say
nay
to
a
union
when
love
gives
our
souls
to
each
other
god
is
love
and
no
higher
can
speak
it
o
hernando
be
father
and
husband
be
angel
and
saint
to
malinche
she
kneels
as
she
would
at
god
altar
to
plead
for
the
heart
you
have
broken
o
turn
from
your
pride
and
but
touch
it
and
it
will
bloom
over
with
blessing
and
will
hallow
the
hand
that
shall
heal
it
all
in
vain
did
she
plead
with
the
chieftain
his
pride
was
the
bane
of
his
footsteps
the
angel
of
love
would
have
held
him
but
the
blood
of
old
spain
was
too
purple
and
smothered
her
tender
endeavor
the
grip
of
his
purpose
still
held
him
and
malinche
now
passive
with
anguish
was
given
to
don
xamarillo
with
all
the
sanction
of
marriage
he
was
kind
indulgent
and
loving
and
she
was
made
wealthy
by
cortez
giving
back
the
estate
of
her
mother
and
much
of
the
wealth
of
the
province
as
if
he
would
purchase
appeasement
the
chieftain
made
lavish
atonement
as
far
as
the
world
could
atone
her
but
her
heart
was
impossible
healing
though
her
charities
gave
her
some
solace
and
she
strove
with
the
earnest
of
pathos
to
lose
in
the
anguish
of
others
the
shadow
of
self
and
of
sorrow
yet
she
wended
her
way
and
as
if
like
the
spirit
of
aztlan
with
the
mark
of
perpetual
sadness
with
the
head
bending
over
and
brooding
as
groping
her
way
to
the
sunset
peering
out
for
the
light
that
was
passing
for
ever
and
aye
with
the
shadows
she
fell
asleep
with
her
people
and
an
angel
was
born
in
heaven
and
a
guardian
angel
descended
and
gathered
thy
ashes
dead
aztlan
and
spread
her
white
wings
the
casket
to
wait
for
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
that
called
thee
to
life
and
to
freedom
it
rode
on
the
wing
of
the
north
wind
and
shook
the
whole
earth
when
it
sounded
and
no
plainer
hozanna
gave
echo
than
arose
from
thy
halls
montezuma
when
the
shade
of
malinche
gave
battle
and
the
armies
of
spain
were
dismembered
as
mexitli
arose
from
her
ashes
and
a
star
was
replanted
in
heaven
and
now
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
when
lovers
await
at
the
casement
the
tokened
response
of
their
ladies
when
chapultepec
garlands
her
tablets
with
the
beautiful
plumage
of
springtime
and
a
thousand
sprays
of
the
sunlight
give
her
walls
all
the
charm
of
enchantment
malinche
is
seen
through
the
shadows
the
unsummoned
guest
at
each
wedding
the
unspoken
tryst
of
all
lovers
wherever
two
hands
are
united
the
hand
of
a
third
presses
them
the
troth
of
two
hearts
is
cemented
by
the
one
that
was
cruelly
broken
no
symbol
of
faith
can
be
stronger
than
the
love
that
is
true
as
malinche
and
she
watches
the
fate
of
the
nation
with
the
jealous
eye
of
a
mother
a
mother
whose
voice
more
than
others
taught
their
lips
the
first
lisp
of
the
gospel
and
tendered
their
steps
toward
heaven
a
saint
at
whose
shrine
they
all
gather
when
the
shadow
of
war
hovers
them
and
the
eagle
swoops
down
from
the
mountain
to
cover
the
snake
with
his
talons
and
they
pledge
anew
to
the
banner
that
arose
again
with
the
nation
when
the
three
hundred
years
of
their
bondage
forged
their
broken
links
into
missiles
to
drive
spain
into
the
ocean
thus
she
holds
the
warm
palm
of
her
people
with
a
memory
stronger
than
shadow
she
lives
and
the
spirit
of
aztlan
the
beautiful
sphinx
of
the
ages
with
its
foot
at
the
threshold
of
empire
and
its
hand
on
the
pulse
of
the
sunrise
and
its
crown
of
all
possible
setting
has
no
brighter
gem
than
malinche
blest
mary
the
mother
of
god
and
tenderest
daughter
of
heaven
thou
too
hast
passed
under
the
rod
and
with
thy
great
sorrow
hast
striven
shall
a
child
of
misfortune
wait
on
this
side
the
beautiful
city
when
thy
hand
is
the
turn
of
the
gate
and
thy
voice
hath
the
magic
of
pity
no
the
word
shall
be
spoken
ere
thought
and
the
prayer
be
granted
ere
spoken
and
the
gate
shall
swing
open
unsought
to
the
heart
that
is
bleeding
and
broken
the
devils
that
tore
magdalene
may
gnash
at
the
sorrow
of
others
since
a
pitying
christ
uttered
peace
mankind
become
sisters
and
brothers
our
faith
hangs
not
on
the
morrow
but
is
instant
and
on
the
wing
with
the
common
signet
of
sorrow
we
pass
to
the
court
of
the
king
the
harp
of
the
west
fair
clime
of
the
sunset
more
richly
endowed
than
hispan
the
knightly
or
gallia
the
proud
where
the
lakes
of
old
scotia
are
lost
in
the
maze
of
thy
thousand
that
mirror
their
heavy
fringed
banks
of
mountain
and
crag
and
the
stateliest
ranks
that
ever
stood
to
the
gaze
of
a
sky
bending
closer
and
breathing
more
near
than
the
heart
ever
throbbed
to
the
fall
of
a
tear
though
the
soul
be
as
barren
as
gobi
bleak
heath
and
the
spirit
of
song
in
the
cold
throes
of
death
can
humanity
throttle
the
play
of
the
breeze
the
harp
that
old
nature
unwittingly
strung
when
the
windows
of
heaven
wide
open
were
flung
for
a
thousand
years
to
thy
masterful
trees
can
the
ear
fail
to
hear
or
the
eye
fail
to
see
thy
rich
crown
thy
sweet
song
great
yo
semite
though
the
brow
of
olympus
be
crowded
with
thrones
and
the
cliffs
of
parnassus
resound
with
the
tones
of
the
muses
that
sang
at
the
foot
of
their
god
not
apollo
great
steeds
nor
the
flame
of
his
car
nor
mars
with
the
terrible
glitter
of

dazzle
the

thy
sun

thou

what

a

in

so
strong
that
eternity
finger
alone
can
displace
and
write
its
own
letters
to
fill
up

our

long
so
long
that
we
simply
write

leave

our

his
letters
a

no
