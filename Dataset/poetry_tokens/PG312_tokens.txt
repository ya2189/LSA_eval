note
this
etext
was
transcribed
from
the
american
original
edition
there
are
some
slight
differences
such
as
making
the
titles
in
the
contents
conform
exactly
to
the
titles
of
the
individual
sections
for
ease
of
searching
and
correction
of
mistakes
which
are
very
obviously
mistakes
and
not
merely
archaic
or
unorthodox
usage
but
great
care
has
been
taken
not
to
change
the
text
and
hopefully
this
has
been
accomplished
some
of
these
poems
were
originally
printed
in
various
periodicals
to
dedication
and
so
to
you
who
always
were
perseus
lancelot
to
me
i
give
these
weedy
rhymes
in
memory
of
earlier
times
now
all
those
careless
days
are
not
of
all
my
heroes
you
endure
words
are
such
silly
things
too
rough
too
smooth
they
boil
up
or
congeal
and
neither
of
us
likes
emotion
but
i
ca
measure
my
devotion
and
you
know
how
i
really
feel
and
we
together
there
enough
foreword
by
chauncey
brewster
tinker
in
these
days
when
the
old
civilisation
is
crumbling
beneath
our
feet
the
thought
of
poetry
crosses
the
mind
like
the
dear
memory
of
things
that
have
long
since
passed
away
in
our
passionate
desire
for
the
new
era
it
is
difficult
to
refrain
oneself
from
the
commonplace
practice
of
speculating
on
the
effects
of
warfare
and
of
prophesying
all
manner
of
novel
rebirths
but
it
may
be
well
for
us
to
remember
that
the
era
which
has
recently
closed
was
itself
marked
by
a
mad
idealisation
of
all
novelties
in
the
literary
movements
of
the
last
decade
when
indeed
any
movement
at
all
has
been
perceptible
we
have
witnessed
a
bewildering
rise
and
fall
of
methods
and
ideals
we
were
captivated
for
a
time
by
the
quest
of
the
golden
phrase
and
the
accompanying
cultivation
of
exotic
emotions
and
then
wearying
of
the
pretty
and
the
temperamental
we
plunged
into
the
bloodshot
brutalities
of
naturalism
from
the
imitations
of
tennyson
and
swinburne
we
passed
into
a
false
freedom
that
had
at
its
heart
a
repudiation
of
all
law
and
standards
for
a
parallel
to
which
one
turns
instinctively
to
certain
recent
developments
in
the
political
world
we
may
hope
that
the
eager
search
for
novelty
of
form
and
subject
may
have
its
influence
in
releasing
us
from
our
old
bondage
to
the
commonplace
and
in
broadening
the
scope
of
poetry
but
we
can
not
blind
ourselves
to
the
fact
that
it
has
at
the
same
time
completed
that
estrangement
between
the
poet
and
the
general
public
which
has
been
developing
for
half
a
century
the
great
mass
of
the
reading
world
to
whom
the
arts
should
minister
have
now
forgotten
that
poetry
is
a
consolation
in
times
of
doubt
and
peril
a
beacon
and
an
mark
in
a
crazed
and
shifting
world
our
poetry
and
i
am
speaking
in
particular
of
american
poetry
has
been
centrifugal
our
poets
have
broken
up
into
smaller
and
ever
smaller
groups
individualism
has
triumphed
to
the
general
confusion
critics
if
they
may
be
said
to
have
existed
at
all
have
added
by
their
paltry
conception
of
the
art
they
have
deemed
it
a
sufficient
denunciation
of
a
poet
to
accuse
him
of
imitating
his
masters
as
though
the
history
of
an
art
were
rather
a
series
of
violent
rebellions
than
a
growth
and
a
progressive
illumination
not
all
generations
are
privileged
to
see
the
working
of
a
great
creative
impulse
but
the
want
keen
though
it
be
furnishes
no
reason
for
the
utter
rejection
of
a
tremulous
murmur
from
great
days
long
dead
but
this
fear
of
echoing
the
past
may
work
us
a
yet
greater
misfortune
in
the
rejection
of
the
manner
of
an
earlier
epoch
may
be
implicit
also
the
rejection
of
the
very
sources
from
which
springs
the
life
of
the
fair
art
melody
and
a
love
of
the
green
earth
and
a
yearning
for
god
are
of
the
very
fabric
of
poetry
deny
it
who
will
the
muses
still
reign
on
parnassus
wax
the
heathen
never
so
furious
poets
who
love
poetry
better
than
their
own
fame
in
grub
street
will
do
well
to
remember
the
flame
the
noble
pageant
of
our
life
the
burning
seal
that
stamps
man
high
indenture
to
vain
attempt
and
most
forlorn
adventure
romance
and
purple
seas
and
toppling
towns
and
the
wind
valiance
crying
the
downs
it
is
a
poor
business
to
find
in
such
words
only
the
illusions
of
youth
and
a
new
enthusiasm
the
desire
for
novelty
the
passion
for
force
and
dirt
and
the
hankering
after
freakishness
of
mood
which
many
have
attempted
to
substitute
for
the
older
and
simpler
things
are
themselves
the
best
evidence
of
disillusion
and
jaded
nerves
there
is
a
weariness
and
a
disgust
in
our
recent
impatience
with
beauty
which
indicate
too
clearly
the
exhaustion
of
our
spiritual
resources
it
may
well
be
that
the
rebirth
of
poetry
is
to
be
manifest
in
a
reappearance
of
the
obvious
in
a
love
of
the
sea
and
of
the
beauty
of
clouds
in
the
adventure
of
death
and
the
yet
more
amazing
adventure
of
living
in
a
vital
love
of
colour
whether
of
the
orient
or
the
in
childlike
love
of
melody
and
the
cool
cleansing
of
rain
in
strange
faces
and
old
memories
this
in
the
past
has
been
poetry
and
this
will
be
poetry
again
the
singer
who
out
of
a
full
heart
can
offer
to
the
world
his
vision
of
its
beauty
and
out
of
a
noble
mind
his
conception
of
its
destiny
will
bestow
upon
his
time
the
most
precious
gift
which
we
can
now
receive
the
gift
of
his

oh

i
went
over

night
falls
the
great
jars
glow
against
the
dark
dark
green
dusk
red
and
like
a
coiling
snake
writhing
eternally
in
smoky
gyres
great
ropes
of
gorgeous
vapor
twist
and
turn
within
them
so
the
eastern
fisherman
saw
the
swart
genie
rise
when
the
lead
seal
scribbled
with
charms
was
lifted
from
the
jar
and
well
how
went
the
tale
like
this
like
this
no
herbage
broke
the
barren
flats
of
land
no
winds
dared
loiter
within
smiling
trees
nor
were
there
any
brooks
on
either
hand
only
the
dry
bright
sand
naked
and
golden
lay
before
the
seas
one
boat
toiled
noiselessly
along
the
deep
the
thirsty
ripples
dying
silently
upon
its
track
far
out
the
brown
nets
sweep
and
night
begins
to
creep
across
the
intolerable
mirror
of
the
sea
twice
the
nets
rise
with
brown
distorted
shells
and
rocks
with
slime
nought
else
the
fisher
sick
at
heart
kneels
down
prayer
may
appease
god
frown
he
thinks
then
kneeling
casts
for
the
third
time
and
lo
an
earthen
jar
bound
round
with
brass
lies
tangled
in
the
cordage
of
his
net
about
the
bright
waves
gleam
like
shattered
glass
and
where
the
sea
rim
was
the
sun
dips
flat
and
red
about
to
set
the
prow
grates
on
the
beach
the
fisherman
stoops
tearing
at
the
cords
that
bind
the
seal
shall
pearls
roll
out
lustrous
and
white
and
wan
lapis
carnelian
stones
that
make
the
sick
mind
reel
with
wonder
of
their
beauty
rubies
then
green
emeralds
glittering
like
the
eyes
of
beasts
poisonous
opals
good
to
madden
men
gold
bezants
ten
and
ten
hard
regal
diamonds
like
kingly
feasts
he
tugged
the
seal
gave
way
a
little
smoke
curled
like
a
feather
in
the
darkening
sky
a
blinding
gush
of
fire
burst
flamed
and
broke
a
voice
like
a
wind
spoke
armored
with
light
and
turbaned
terribly
a
genie
tramped
the
round
earth
underfoot
his
head
sought
out
the
stars
his
cupped
right
hand
made
half
the
sky
one
darkness
he
was
mute
the
sun
a
ripened
fruit
drooped
lower
scarlet
eddied
the
sand
the
genie
spoke
o
miserable
one
thy
prize
awaits
thee
come
and
hug
it
close
a
noble
crown
thy
draggled
nets
have
won
for
this
that
thou
hast
done
blessed
are
fools
a
gift
remains
for
those
his
hand
sought
out
his
sword
and
lightnings
flared
across
the
sky
in
one
great
bloom
of
fire
poised
like
a
toppling
mountain
it
hung
bared
suns
that
were
jewels
glared
along
its
hilt
the
air
burnt
like
a
pyre
once
more
the
genie
spoke
something
i
owe
to
thee
thou
fool
thou
fool
come
canst
thou
sing
yea
sing
then
if
thy
song
be
brave
then
go
free
and
released
or
no
find
first
some
task
some
overmastering
thing
i
can
not
do
and
find
it
speedily
for
if
thou
dost
not
thou
shalt
surely
die
the
sword
whirled
back
the
fisherman
uprose
and
if
at
first
his
voice
was
weak
with
fear
and
his
limbs
trembled
it
was
but
a
doze
and
at
the
high
song
close
he
stood
up
straight
his
voice
rang
loud
and
clear
the
song
last
night
the
quays
were
lighted
cressets
of
smoking
pine
glared
the
roaring
mariners
that
drink
the
yellow
wine
their
song
rolled
to
the
rafters
it
struck
the
high
stars
pale
such
worth
was
in
their
discourse
such
wonder
in
their
tale
blue
borage
filled
the
clinking
cups
the
murky
night
grew
wan
till
one
rose
crowned
with
that
was
an
outland
man
come
let
us
drink
to
war
said
he
the
torch
of
the
sacked
town
the
and
the
and
harald
of
renown
yea
while
the
milk
was
on
his
lips
before
the
day
was
born
he
took
the
almayne
kaiser
head
to
be
his
yea
while
the
down
was
on
his
chin
or
yet
his
beard
was
grown
he
broke
the
gates
of
micklegarth
and
stole
the
drink
to
harald
king
of
the
world
lord
of
the
tongue
and
the
troth
to
the
bellowing
horns
of
ostfriesland
and
the
trumpets
of
the
goth
their
shouts
rolled
to
the
rafters
the
crashed
and
rang
and
all
their
talk
was
a
clangor
of
war
as
swords
together
sang
dimly
through
the
deep
night
where
stars
like
flowers
shone
a
passionate
shape
came
gliding
i
saw
one
thing
alone
i
only
saw
my
young
love
shining
against
the
dark
the
whiteness
of
her
raiment
the
head
that
bent
to
hark
i
only
saw
my
young
love
like
flowers
in
the
sun
her
hands
like
waxen
petals
where
yawning
poppies
run
i
only
felt
there
chrysmal
against
my
cheek
her
breath
though
all
the
winds
were
baying
and
the
sky
bright
with
red
sparks
whirled
up
the
chimney
a
hungry
flaught
of
flame
and
a
lean
man
from
greece
arose
thrasyllos
was
his
name
i
praise
all
noble
wines
he
cried
green
robes
of
tissue
fine
peacocks
and
apes
and
ivory
and
homer
line
statues
and
rings
and
carven
gems
and
the
wise
crawling
sea
but
most
of
all
the
crowns
of
kings
the
rule
they
wield
thereby
power
fired
power
blank
and
bright
a
fit
hilt
for
the
hand
the
one
good
sword
for
a
freeman
while
yet
the
cold
stars
stand
their
shouts
rolled
to
the
rafters
the
air
was
thick
with
wine
only
knew
her
deep
eyes
and
felt
her
hand
in
mine
softly
as
quiet
water
one
finger
touched
my
cheek
her
face
like
gracious
moonlight
i
might
not
move
nor
speak
i
only
saw
that
beauty
i
only
felt
that
form
there
in
the
silken
darkness
god
wot
my
heart
was
warm
their
shouts
rolled
to
the
rafters
another
chief
began
his
slit
lips
showed
him
for
a
hun
he
was
an
evil
man
sing
to
the
joys
of
women
he
yelled
the
hot
delicious
tents
the
soft
couch
and
the
white
limbs
the
air
a
steam
of
scents
his
eyes
gleamed
and
he
wet
his
lips
the
rafters
shook
with
cheers
as
he
sang
of
woman
who
is
man
slave
for
all
unhonored
years
whether
the
wanton
laughs
amain
with
one
white
shoulder
bare
or
in
a
sacked
room
you
unbind
some
crouching
maiden
hair
this
is
the
only
good
for
man
like
spices
of
the
south
to
see
the
glimmering
body
laid
as
pasture
to
his
mouth
to
leave
no
lees
within
the
cup
to
see
and
take
and
rend
to
lap
a
girl
limbs
up
like
wine
and
laugh
knowing
the
end
like
low
still
breathing
i
heard
one
voice
one
word
and
hot
speech
poured
upon
my
lips
as
my
hands
held
a
fools
thrice
fools
of
lust
i
cried
your
eyes
are
blind
to
see
eternal
beauty
moving
far
more
glorious
than
horns
of
war
but
though
my
eyes
were
one
blind
scar
that
sight
is
shown
to
me
you
nuzzle
at
the
ivory
side
you
clasp
the
golden
head
fools
fools
who
chatter
and
sing
you
have
taken
the
sign
of
a
terrible
thing
you
have
drunk
down
god
with
your
beeswing
and
broken
the
saints
for
bread
for
god
moves
darkly
in
silence
and
in
storm
but
in
the
body
of
woman
he
shows
one
burning
form
for
god
moves
blindly
in
darkness
and
in
dread
but
in
the
body
of
woman
he
raises
up
the
dead
gracile
and
straight
as
birches
swift
as
the
questing
birds
they
fill
up
who
speak
not
having
no
words
love
is
not
delicate
toying
a
slim
and
shimmering
mesh
it
is
two
souls
wrenched
into
one
two
bodies
made
one
flesh
lust
is
a
sprightly
servant
gallant
where
wines
are
poured
love
is
a
bitter
master
love
is
an
iron
lord
satin
ease
of
the
body
fattened
sloth
of
the
hands
these
and
their
like
he
will
not
send
only
immortal
fires
to
rend
and
the
world
end
is
your
journey
end
and
your
stream
chokes
in
the
sands
pleached
calms
shall
not
await
you
peace
you
shall
never
find
nought
but
the
living
moorland
scourged
naked
by
the
wind
nought
but
the
living
moorland
and
your
love
hand
in
yours
the
strength
more
sure
than
surety
the
mercy
that
endures
then
though
they
give
you
to
be
burned
and
slay
you
like
a
stoat
you
have
found
the
world
heart
in
the
turn
of
a
cheek
heaven
in
the
lift
of
a
throat
although
they
break
you
on
the
wheel
that
stood
so
straight
in
the
sun
behind
you
the
trumpets
split
the
sky
where
the
lost
and
furious
fight
goes
by
and
god
our
god
will
have
victory
when
the
red
day
is
done
their
mirth
rolled
to
the
rafters
they
bellowed
lechery
light
as
a
drifting
feather
my
love
slipped
from
my
knee
within
the
lights
were
yellow
in
drowsy
rooms
and
warm
without
the
stabbing
lightning
shattered
across
the
storm
within
the
great
logs
crackled
the
emptied
soon
without
the
black
cloaks
of
the
clouds
strangled
the
waning
moon
my
love
crossed
the
threshold
god
but
the
night
was
murk
i
set
myself
against
the
cold
and
left
them
to
their
work
their
shouts
rolled
to
the
rafters
a
bitterer
way
was
mine
and
i
left
them
in
the
tavern
drinking
the
yellow
wine
the
last
faint
echoes
rang
along
the
plains
died
and
were
gone
the
genie
spoke
thy
song
serves
well
enough
but
yet
thy
task
remains
many
and
rending
pains
shall
torture
him
who
dares
delay
too
long
his
brown
face
hardened
to
a
leaden
mask
a
bitter
brine
crusted
the
fisher
cheek
almighty
god
one
thing
alone
i
ask
show
me
a
task
a
task
the
hard
cup
of
the
sky
shone
gemmed
and
bleak
o
love
whom
i
have
sought
by
devious
ways
o
hidden
beauty
naked
as
a
star
you
whose
bright
hair
has
burned
across
my
days
making
them
lamps
of
praise
o
breathing
of
arabia
you
have
i
served
now
fire
has
parched
the
vine
and
death
is
on
the
singers
and
the
song
no
longer
are
there
lips
to
cling
to
mine
and
the
heart
wearies
of
wine
and
i
am
sick
for
my
desire
is
long
o
love
delicate
and
tender
in
her
gold
house
the
pipe
calls
querulously
they
cloud
with
thin
green
silks
her
body
slender
they
talk
to
her
and
tend
her
come
piteous
gentle
love
and
set
me
free
he
ceased
and
slowly
rising
the
deep
a
faint
song
chimed
grew
clearer
till
at
last
a
golden
horn
of
light
began
to
creep
where
the
dumb
ripples
sweep
making
the
sea
one
splendor
where
it
passed
a
golden
boat
the
bright
oars
rested
soon
and
the
prow
met
the
sand
the
purple
veils
misting
the
cabin
fell
fair
as
the
moon
when
the
morning
comes
too
soon
and
all
the
air
is
silver
in
the
dales
a
princess
stepped
upon
the
beach
the
fisher
knelt
and
kissed
her
garment
hem
and
then
her
lips
and
strove
at
last
for
speech
the
waters
lapped
the
reach
here
thy
strength
breaks
thy
might
is
nought
to
stem
he
cried
at
last
speech
shook
him
like
a
flame
yea
though
thou
plucked
the
stars
from
out
the
sky
each
lovely
one
would
be
a
withered
shame
each
thou
couldst
find
or
name
to
this
beauty
wearily
the
genie
heard
a
slow
smile
came
like
dawn
over
his
face
thy
task
is
done
he
said
a
whirlwind
roared
smoke
shattered
he
was
gone
and
like
a
sudden
horn
the
moon
shone
clear
no
longer
smoked
and
red
they
passed
into
the
boat
the
gold
oars
beat
loudly
then
fainter
fainter
till
at
last
only
the
quiet
waters
barely
moved
along
the
whispering
sand
till
all
the
vast
expanse
of
sea
began
to
shake
with
heat
and
morning
brought
soft
airs
by
sailors
loved
and
after
well
the
clangs
who
comes
quinine
i
pour
the
little
bitter
grains
out
upon
blue
glazed
squares
of
paper
so
and
all
the
dusk
i
shall
sit
here
alone
with
many
powers
in
my
hands
ah
see
how
the
blurred
labels
run
on
the
old
jars
opium
and
a
cruel
and
sleepy
scent
the
harsh
taste
of
white
poppies
india
the
writhing
woods
with
monstrous
life
save
where
the
deodars
are
set
like
spears
and
a
calm
pool
is
mirrored
ebony
opium
brown
and
warm
and
she
rises
shaking
off
the
cool
black
water
and
twisting
up
her
hair
that
ripples
down
a
torrent
of
black
water
to
her
feet
how
the
drops
sparkle
in
the
moonlight
once
i
made
a
rhyme
about
it
singing
softly
over
damascus
every
star
keeps
his
unchanging
course
and
cold
the
dark
weighs
like
an
iron
bar
the
intense
and
pallid
night
is
old
dim
the
moon
scimitar
still
the
lamps
blaze
within
those
halls
where
poppies
heap
the
marble
vats
for
girls
to
tread
the
thick
air
palls
and
shadows
hang
like
evil
bats
about
the
scented
walls
the
girls
are
many
and
they
sing
their
white
feet
fall
like
flakes
of
snow
making
a
ceaseless
murmuring
whispers
of
love
dead
long
ago
and
dear
forgotten
spring
one
alone
sings
not
tiredly
she
sees
the
white
blooms
crushed
and
smells
the
heavy
scent
they
chatter
see
white
zira
thinks
of
nothing
else
but
the
morn
jollity
then
haroun
takes
her
but
she
dreams
unhearing
of
a
certain
field
of
poppies
cut
by
many
streams
like
lines
across
a
round
turk
shield
where
now
the
hot
sun
gleams
the
field
whereon
they
walked
that
day
and
splendor
filled
her
body
up
and
his
and
then
the
trampled
clay
and
slow
smoke
climbing
the
sky
cup
from
where
the
village
lay
and
after
much
ache
of
the
wrists
where
the
cords
irked
her
till
she
came
the
price
of
many
amethysts
hither
and
now
the
ultimate
shame
blew
trumpet
in
the
lists
and
so
she
trod
the
poppies
there
remembering
other
poppies
too
and
did
not
seem
to
see
or
care
without
the
first
gray
drops
of
dew
sweetened
the
trembling
air
she
trod
the
poppies
hours
passed
until
she
slept
at
length
and
time
dragged
his
slow
sickle
when
at
last
she
woke
the
moon
shone
bright
as
rime
and
night
tide
rolled
on
fast
she
moaned
once
knowing
everything
then
bitterer
than
death
she
found
the
soft
handmaidens
in
a
ring
come
to
anoint
her
all
around
that
she
might
please
the
king
opium
and
the
odor
dies
away
leaving
the
air
yet
heavy
cassia
myrrh
bitter
and
splendid
see
the
poisons
come
trooping
in
squat
green
vials
blazoned
red
with
grinning
skulls
strychnine
a
pallid
dust
of
tiny
grains
like
bones
ground
fine
and
next
the
muddy
green
of
arsenic
all
livid
likest
the
face
of
one
long
dead
they
creep
along
the
dusty
shelf
like
deadly
beetles
whose
fangs
are
carved
with
runnels
that
the
blood
may
run
down
easily
to
the
blind
mouth
that
snaps
and
gapes
and
high
above
them
there
my
master
pride
a
cobwebbed
yellow
pot
of
honey
from
mount
hybla
do
the
bees
still
moan
among
the
low
sweet
purple
clover
endlessly
many
still
in
woods
when
the
incredible
silver
of
the
moon
comes
like
a
living
wind
through
branches
still
steal
dark
shapes
from
the
enchanted
glens
which
yet
are
purple
with
high
dreams
and
still
fronting
that
quiet
and
eternal
shield
which
is
much
more
than
peace
does
there
still
stand
one
sharp
black
shadow
and
the
short
smooth
horns
are
clear
against
that
disk
o
great
diana
i
i
have
praised
thee
yet
i
do
not
know
what
moves
my
mind
so
strangely
save
that
once
i
lay
all
night
upon
a
thymy
hill
and
watched
the
slow
clouds
pass
like
foam
across
blue
marble
till
at
last
no
speck
blotted
the
clear
expanse
and
the
full
moon
rose
in
much
light
and
all
night
long
i
saw
her
ordered
progress
till
in
midmost
heaven
there
came
a
terrible
silence
and
the
mice
crept
to
their
holes
the
crickets
did
not
chirp
all
the
small
stopped
and
clear
pure
light
rippled
like
silk
over
the
universe
most
cold
and
bleak
and
yet
my
heart
beat
fast
waiting
until
the
stillness
broke
i
know
not
for
what
i
waited
something
very
great
i
dared
not
look
up
to
the
sky
for
fear
a
brittle
crackling
should
clash
suddenly
against
the
quiet
and
a
black
line
creep
across
the
sky
and
widen
like
a
mouth
until
the
broken
heavens
streamed
apart
like
torn
lost
banners
and
the
immortal
fires
roaring
like
lions
asked
their
meat
from
god
i
lay
there
a
black
blot
upon
a
shield
of
quivering
watery
whiteness
the
hush
held
until
i
staggered
up
and
cried
aloud
and
then
it
seemed
that
something
far
too
great
for
knowledge
and
illimitable
as
god
rent
the
dark
sky
like
lightning
and
i
fell
and
falling
heard
a
wild
and
rushing
wind
of
music
and
saw
lights
that
blinded
me
with
white
impenetrable
swords
and
felt
a
pressure
of
soft
hands
upon
my
lips
upon
my
eyelids
and
since
then
i
cough
at
times
and
have
strange
thoughts
about
the
stars
that
some
day
some
day
come
i
must
be
quick
my
master
will
be
back
soon
let
me
light
thin
blue
arabian
pastilles
and
sit
like
a
dead
god
incensed
by
chanting
priests
and
watch
the
pungent
smoke
wreathe
up
and
up
until
he
comes
though
he
may
rage
because
they
cost
good
money
then
i
shall
walk
home
over
the
moor
already
the
moon
climbs
above
the
world
edge
by
the
time
he
comes
she
will
be
fully
risen
there
his
step
ii
miscellaneous
rain
after
a
vaudeville
show
the
last
pose
flickered
failed
the
screen
dead
white
glared
in
a
sudden
flooding
of
harsh
light
stabbing
the
eyes
and
as
i
stumbled
out
the
curtain
rose
a
fat
girl
with
a
pout
and
legs
like
hams
began
to
sing
his
mother
gusts
of
bad
air
rose
in
a
choking
smother
smoke
the
wet
steam
of
clothes
the
stench
of
plush
powder
cheap
perfume
mingled
in
a
rush
i
stepped
into
the
lobby
and
stood
still
struck
dumb
by
sudden
beauty
body
and
will
cleanness
and
rapture
excellence
made
plain
the
storming
thrashing
arrows
of
the
rain
pouring
and
dripping
on
the
roofs
and
rods
smelling
of
woods
and
hills
and
sods
black
on
the
sidewalks
gray
in
the
far
sky
crashing
on
thirsty
panes
on
gutters
dry
hurrying
the
crowd
to
shelter
making
fair
the
streets
the
houses
and
the
air
merciful
holy
charging
sweeping
flashing
it
smote
the
soul
with
a
most
iron
clashing
like
dragons
eyes
the
suddenly
gleamed
yellow
and
round
and
globes
of
flame
and
the
clouds
tall
banners
streamed
out
of
the
petty
wars
the
daily
shame
beauty
strove
suddenly
and
rose
and
flowered
i
gripped
my
coat
and
plunged
where
awnings
lowered
made
one
with
hissing
blackness
caught
embraced
by
splendor
and
by
striving
and
swift
haste
spring
coming
in
with
thunderings
and
strife
i
stamped
the
ground
in
the
strong
joy
of
life
the
city
revisited
the
grey
gulls
drift
across
the
bay
softly
and
still
as
flakes
of
snow
against
the
thinning
fog
all
day
i
sat
and
watched
them
come
and
go
and
now
at
last
the
sun
was
set
filling
the
waves
with
colored
fire
till
each
seemed
like
a
jewelled
spire
thrust
up
from
some
drowned
city
soon
from
peak
and
cliff
and
minaret
the
city
lights
began
to
wink
each
like
a
friendly
word
the
moon
began
to
broaden
out
her
shield
spurting
with
silver
straight
before
the
brown
hills
lay
like
quiet
beasts
stretched
out
beside
a
door
and
filling
earth
and
sky
and
field
with
the
calm
heaving
of
their
breasts
nothing
was
gone
nothing
was
changed
the
smallest
wave
was
unestranged
by
all
the
long
ache
of
the
years
since
last
i
saw
them
blind
with
tears
their
welcome
like
the
hills
stood
fast
and
i
i
had
come
home
at
last
so
i
laughed
out
with
them
aloud
to
think
that
now
the
sun
was
broad
and
climbing
up
the
iron
sky
where
the
raw
streets
stretched
sullenly
about
another
room
i
knew
in
a
mean
house
and
soon
there
too
the
smith
would
burst
the
flimsy
door
and
find
me
lying
on
the
floor
just
where
i
fell
the
other
night
after
that
breaking
wave
of
pain
how
they
will
storm
and
rage
and
fight
servants
and
mistress
one
and
all
no
money
for
the
funeral
i
broke
my
life
there
let
it
stand
at
that
the
waters
are
a
plain
heaving
and
bright
on
either
hand
a
tremulous
and
lustral
peace
which
shall
endure
though
all
things
cease
filling
my
heart
as
water
fills
a
cup
there
stand
the
quiet
hills
so
waiting
for
my
wings
to
grow
i
watch
the
gulls
sail
to
and
fro
rising
and
falling
soft
and
swift
drifting
along
as
bubbles
drift
and
though
i
see
the
face
of
god
hereafter
this
day
have
i
trod
nearer
to
him
than
i
shall
tread
ever
again
the
night
is
dead
and
there
the
dawn
poured
out
like
wine
along
the
dim
and
from
the
city
comes
the
chimes
we
have
our
heaven
on
earth
sometimes
going
back
to
school
the
boat
ploughed
on
now
alcatraz
was
past
and
all
the
grey
waves
flamed
to
red
again
at
the
dead
sun
last
glimmer
far
and
vast
the
sausalito
lights
burned
suddenly
in
little
dots
and
clumps
as
if
a
pen
had
scrawled
vague
lines
of
gold
across
the
hills
the
sky
was
like
a
cup
some
rare
wine
fills
and
stars
came
as
he
watched
and
he
was
free
one
splendid
instant
back
in
the
great
room
curled
in
a
chair
with
all
of
them
beside
and
the
whole
world
a
rush
of
happy
voices
with
laughter
beating
in
a
clamorous
tide
saw
once
again
the
heat
of
harvest
fume
up
to
the
empty
sky
in
threads
like
glass
and
ran
and
was
a
part
of
what
rejoices
in
thunderous
nights
of
rain
lay
in
the
grass
and
tired
looking
through
a
maze
of
tiny
stems
into
a
new
green
world
once
more
knew
eves
of
perfume
days
ablaze
with
clear
dry
heat
on
the
brown
rolling
fields
shuddered
with
fearful
ecstasy
in
bed
over
a
book
of
knights
and
bloody
shields
the
ship
slowed
jarred
and
stopped
there
straight
ahead
were
dock
and
fellows
stumbling
he
was
whirled
out
and
away
to
meet
them
and
his
back
slumped
to
the
old
his
hands
fell
slack
a
big
boy
arm
went
round
him
and
a
twist
sent
shattering
pain
along
his
tortured
wrist
as
a
voice
cried
a
bloated
voice
and
fat
why
it
miss
nancy
come
along
you
rat
nos
immortales
perhaps
we
go
with
wind
and
cloud
and
sun
into
the
free
companionship
of
air
perhaps
with
sunsets
when
the
day
is
done
all
one
to
me
i
do
not
greatly
care
so
long
as
there
are
brown
hills
and
a
tree
like
a
mad
prophet
in
a
land
of
dearth
and
i
can
lie
and
hear
eternally
the
vast
monotonous
breathing
of
the
earth
i
have
known
hours
slow
and
lovely
with
laughter
and
suffused
with
light
o
lord
in
such
a
time
appoint
my
going
when
the
hands
clench
and
the
cold
face
grows
white
and
the
spark
dies
within
the
feeble
brain
spilling
its
back
to
dust
again
young
blood
but
sir
i
said
they
tell
me
the
man
is
like
to
die
the
canon
shook
his
head
indulgently
young
blood
cousin
he
boomed
young
blood
youth
will
be
served
fabliaux
he
woke
up
with
a
sick
taste
in
his
mouth
and
lay
there
heavily
while
dancing
motes
whirled
through
his
brain
in
endless
rippling
streams
and
a
grey
mist
weighed
down
upon
his
eyes
so
that
they
could
not
open
fully
yet
after
some
time
his
blurred
mind
stumbled
back
to
its
last
ragged
memory
a
room
air
foul
with
wine
a
shouting
reeling
crowd
of
friends
who
dragged
him
dazed
and
blind
with
drink
out
to
the
street
a
crazy
rout
of
cabs
the
steady
mutter
of
his
neighbor
voice
mumbling
out
dull
obscenity
by
rote
and
then
well
they
had
brought
him
home
it
seemed
since
he
awoke
in
bed
oh
damn
the
business
he
had
not
wanted
it
the
silly
jokes
one
last
great
night
of
freedom
ere
you
married
you
get
no
fun
then
do
tell
that
story
he
have
a
wife
soon
god
the
sitting
down
to
drink
till
you
were
sodden
like
great
light
she
came
into
his
thoughts
that
was
the
worst
to
wallow
in
the
mud
like
this
because
his
friends
were
fools
he
was
not
fit
to
touch
to
see
oh
far
far
off
that
silver
place
where
god
stood
manifest
to
man
in
her
fouling
himself
one
thing
he
brought
to
her
at
least
he
had
been
clean
had
taken
it
a
kind
of
point
of
honor
from
the
first
others
might
do
it
but
he
did
care
for
those
things
suddenly
his
vision
cleared
and
something
seemed
to
grow
within
his
mind
something
was
wrong
the
color
of
the
wall
the
queer
shape
of
the
bedposts
everything
was
changed
somehow
his
room
was
this
his
room
he
turned
his
head
and
saw
beside
him
there
the
sagging
body
slope
the
face
and
the
loose
open
mouth
lax
and
awry
the
breasts
the
bleached
and
brittle
hair
these
things
as
if
all
hell
were
crushed
to
one
bright
line
of
lightning
for
a
moment
then
he
sank
prone
beneath
an
intolerable
weight
and
bitter
loathing
crept
up
all
his
limbs
the
quality
of
courage
black
trees
against
an
orange
sky
trees
that
the
wind
shook
terribly
like
a
harsh
spume
along
the
road
quavering
up
like
withered
arms
writhing
like
streams
like
twisted
charms
of
hot
lead
flung
in
snow
below
the
iron
ice
stung
like
a
goad
slashing
the
torn
shoes
from
my
feet
and
all
the
air
was
bitter
sleet
and
all
the
land
was
cramped
with
snow
and
fierce
and
glimmering
wan
like
pale
plains
of
obsidian
and
yet
i
strove
and
i
was
fire
and
ice
and
fire
and
ice
were
one
in
one
vast
hunger
of
desire
a
dim
desire
of
pleasant
places
and
lush
fields
in
the
summer
sun
and
logs
aflame
and
walls
and
faces
and
wine
and
old
ambrosial
talk
a
golden
ball
in
fountains
dancing
and
unforgotten
hands
ah
god
i
trod
them
down
where
i
have
trod
and
they
remain
and
they
remain
etched
in
unutterable
pain
loved
lips
and
faces
now
apart
that
once
were
closer
than
my
heart
in
agony
in
agony
and
horribly
a
part
of
me
for
lethe
is
for
no
man
set
and
in
hell
may
no
man
forget
and
there
were
flowers
and
jugs
and
old
italian
swords
and
looks
a
moment
glance
of
fire
of
fire
spiring
leaping
flaming
higher
into
the
intense
the
cloudless
blue
until
two
souls
were
one
and
flame
and
very
flesh
and
yet
the
same
as
if
all
springs
were
crushed
anew
into
one
globed
drop
of
dew
but
for
the
most
i
thought
of
heat
desiring
greatly
hot
white
sand
the
lazy
body
lies
at
rest
in
or
scented
grass
to
nest
in
and
fires
innumerable
fires
great
fagots
hurling
golden
gyres
of
sparks
far
up
and
the
red
heart
in
crashing
as
they
part
to
tiny
flares
and
kindling
snapping
bunched
sticks
that
burst
their
string
and
wrapping
and
fall
like
jackstraws
green
and
blue
the
evil
flames
of
driftwood
too
and
heavy
sullen
lumps
of
coke
with
still
fierce
heat
and
ugly
smoke
and
then
the
vision
of
his
face
and
theirs
all
theirs
came
like
a
sword
thrice
to
the
heart
and
as
i
fell
i
thought
i
saw
a
light
before
i
woke
my
hands
were
blue
and
sore
torn
on
the
ice
i
scarcely
felt
the
frozen
sleet
begin
to
melt
upon
my
face
as
i
breathed
deeper
but
lay
there
warmly
like
a
sleeper
who
shifts
his
arm
once
and
moans
low
and
then
sinks
back
to
night
slow
slow
and
still
as
death
came
sleep
and
death
and
looked
at
me
with
quiet
breath
unbending
figures
black
and
stark
against
the
intense
deeps
of
the
dark
tall
and
like
trees
like
sweet
and
fire
rest
crept
and
crept
along
my
veins
gently
and
there
were
no
more
pains
was
it
not
better
so
to
lie
the
fight
was
done
even
gods
tire
of
fighting
my
way
was
the
wrong
now
i
should
drift
and
drift
along
to
endless
quiet
golden
peace
and
let
the
tortured
body
cease
and
then
a
light
winked
like
an
eye
and
very
many
miles
away
a
girl
stood
at
a
warm
lit
door
holding
a
lamp
ray
upon
ray
it
cloaked
the
snow
with
perfect
light
and
where
she
was
there
was
no
night
nor
could
be
ever
god
is
sure
and
in
his
hands
are
things
secure
it
is
not
given
me
to
trace
the
lovely
laughter
of
that
face
like
a
clear
brook
most
full
of
light
or
olives
swaying
on
a
height
so
silver
they
have
wings
almost
like
a
great
word
once
known
and
lost
and
meaning
all
things
nor
her
voice
a
happy
sound
where
larks
rejoice
her
body
that
great
loveliness
the
tender
fashion
of
her
dress
i
may
not
paint
them
these
i
see
blazing
through
all
eternity
a
sign
a
glorious
tree
she
stood
there
and
at
once
i
knew
the
bitter
thing
that
i
must
do
there
could
be
no
surrender
now
though
sleep
and
death
were
whispering
low
my
way
was
wrong
so
would
it
mend
if
i
shrank
back
before
the
end
and
sank
to
death
and
cowardice
no
the
last
lees
must
be
drained
up
base
wine
from
an
ignoble
cup
yet
not
so
base
as
sleek
content
when
i
had
shrunk
from
punishment
the
wretched
body
strain
anew
life
was
a
storm
to
wander
through
i
took
the
wrong
way
good
and
well
at
least
my
feet
sought
out
not
hell
though
night
were
one
consuming
flame
i
must
go
on
for
my
base
aim
and
so
perhaps
make
evil
grow
to
something
clean
by
agony
and
reach
that
light
upon
the
snow
and
touch
her
dress
at
last
so
so
i
crawled
i
could
not
speak
or
see
save
dimly
the
ice
glared
like
fire
a
long
bright
hell
of
choking
cold
and
each
vein
was
a
tautened
wire
throbbing
with
torture
and
i
crawled
my
hands
were
wounds
so
i
attained
the
second
hell
the
snow
was
stained
i
thought
and
shook
my
head
at
it
how
red
it
was
black
clutched
and
tore
and
soon
the
snow
was
smutched
anew
and
i
lurched
babbling
on
and
then
fell
down
to
rest
a
bit
and
came
upon
another
hell
loose
stones
that
ice
made
terrible
that
rolled
and
gashed
men
as
they
fell
i
stumbled
slipped
and
all
was
gone
that
i
had
gained
once
more
i
lay
before
the
long
bright
hell
of
ice
and
still
the
light
was
far
away
there
was
red
mist
before
my
eyes
or
i
could
tell
you
how
i
went
across
the
swaying
firmament
a
glittering
torture
of
cold
stars
and
how
i
fought
in
titan
wars
and
died
and
lived
again
upon
the
rack
and
how
the
horses
strain
when
their
red
task
is
nearly
done
i
only
know
that
there
was
pain
infinite
and
eternal
pain
and
that
i
fell
and
rose
again
so
she
was
walking
in
the
road
and
i
stood
upright
like
a
man
once
and
fell
blind
and
heard
her
cry
and
then
there
came
long
agony
there
was
no
pain
when
i
awoke
no
pain
at
all
rest
like
a
goad
spurred
my
eyes
open
and
light
broke
upon
them
like
a
million
swords
and
she
was
there
there
are
no
words
heaven
is
for
a
moment
span
and
ever
so
i
spoke
and
said
my
honor
stands
up
unbetrayed
and
i
have
seen
you
dear
sharp
pain
closed
like
a
cloak
i
moaned
and
died
here
even
here
these
things
remain
i
shall
draw
nearer
to
her
side
oh
dear
and
laughing
lost
to
me
hidden
in
grey
eternity
i
shall
attain
with
burning
feet
to
you
and
to
the
the
ages
crumble
down
like
dust
dark
roses
deviously
thrust
and
scattered
in
sweet
wine
but
i
i
shall
lift
up
to
you
my
cry
and
kiss
your
wet
lips
presently
beneath
the
tree
this
in
my
heart
i
keep
for
goad
somewhere
in
heaven
she
walks
that
road
somewhere
in
heaven
she
walks
that
road
campus
sonnets
before
an
examination
the
little
letters
dance
across
the
page
flaunt
and
retire
and
trick
the
tired
eyes
sick
of
the
strain
the
glaring
light
i
rise
yawning
and
stretching
full
of
empty
rage
at
the
dull
maunderings
of
a
long
dead
sage
fling
up
the
windows
fling
aside
his
lies
choosing
to
breathe
not
stifle
and
be
wise
and
let
the
air
pour
in
upon
my
cage
the
breeze
blows
cool
and
there
are
stars
and
stars
beyond
the
dark
soft
masses
of
the
elms
that
whisper
things
in
windy
tones
and
light
they
seem
to
wheel
for
dim
celestial
wars
and
i
i
hear
the
clash
of
silver
helms
ring
from
the
far
deeps
of
night
talk
tobacco
smoke
drifts
up
to
the
dim
ceiling
from
half
a
dozen
pipes
and
cigarettes
curling
in
endless
shapes
in
blue
rings
wheeling
as
formless
as
our
talk
phil
drawling
bets
cornell
will
win
the
relay
in
a
walk
while
bob
and
mac
discuss
the
giants
chances
deep
in
a
bill
scowls
at
falk
john
gives
large
views
about
the
last
few
dances
and
so
it
goes
an
idle
speech
and
aimless
a
few
chance
phrases
yet
i
see
behind
the
empty
words
the
gleam
of
a
beauty
tameless
friendship
and
peace
and
fire
to
strike
men
blind
till
the
whole
world
seems
small
and
bright
to
hold
of
all
our
youth
this
hour
is
pure
gold
may
morning
i
lie
stretched
out
upon
the
and
doze
and
read
a
page
or
two
and
doze
and
feel
the
air
like
water
on
me
close
great
waves
of
sunny
air
that
lip
and
beat
with
a
small
noise
monotonous
and
sweet
against
the
window
and
the
scent
of
cool
frail
flowers
by
some
brown
and
pool
possesses
me
from
drowsy
head
to
feet
this
is
the
time
of
laughter
at
idiotic
things
some
one
has
done
and
there
is
neither
past
nor
vague
hereafter
and
all
your
body
stretches
in
the
sun
and
drinks
the
light
in
like
a
liquid
thing
filled
with
the
divine
languor
of
late
spring
return
the
college
will
reopen
sept
i
was
just
aiming
at
the
jagged
hole
torn
in
the
yellow
sandbags
of
their
trench
when
something
threw
me
sideways
with
a
wrench
and
the
skies
seemed
to
shrivel
like
a
scroll
and
disappear
and
propped
against
the
bole
of
a
big
elm
i
lay
and
watched
the
clouds
float
through
the
blue
deep
sky
in
speckless
crowds
and
i
was
clean
again
and
young
and
whole
lord
what
a
dream
that
was
and
what
a
doze
waiting
for
bill
to
come
along
to
class
i
cut
it
now
and
he
oh
hello

the

what
gorgeous
dyes
flow
in
the
eyes
and
how
deep
lustrous
greens
are
splashed
and
spilt
along
the
back
that
like
a
crest
scatters
soft
beauty
th
emblazoned
breast
a
strange
fowl
but
most
fit
for
feasts
like
this
whereby
i
honor
one
pure
as
the
sun
yet
glowing
with
the
fiery
zeal
of
it
some
wine
your
goblet
empty

it

it
is
not
often
that
you
come
to

you
like
the

rippled
with
lines
that
float
like

of

when

when

little
rose
the
breaking
point
it
was
not
when
temptation
came
swiftly
and
blastingly
as
flame
and
seared
me
white
with
burning
scars
when
i
stood
up
for
wars
and
held
the
very
fiend
at
grips
when
all
my
mutinous
body
rose
to
range
itself
beside
my
foes
and
like
a
greyhound
in
the
slips
the
beast
that
dwells
within
me
roared
lunging
and
straining
at
his
cord
for
all
the
blusterings
of
hell
it
was
not
then
i
slipped
and
fell
for
all
the
storm
for
all
the
hate
i
kept
my
soul
inviolate
but
when
the
fight
was
fought
and
won
and
there
was
peace
as
still
as
death
on
everything
beneath
the
sun
just
as
i
started
to
draw
breath
and
yawn
and
stretch
and
pat
myself
the
grass
began
to
whisper
things
and
every
tree
became
an
elf
that
grinned
and
chuckled
counsellings
birds
beasts
one
thing
alone
they
said
beating
and
dinning
at
my
head
i
could
not
fly
i
could
not
shun
it
slimily
twisting
slow
and
blind
it
crept
and
crept
into
my
mind
whispered
and
shouted
sneered
and
laughed
screamed
out
until
my
brain
was
daft
one
snaky
word
what
if
you
done
it
and
i
began
to
think
ah
well
what
matter
how
i
slipped
and
fell
or
you
you
say
tell
where
you
found
me
yesterday
lonely
burial
there
were
not
many
at
that
lonely
place
where
two
scourged
hills
met
in
a
little
plain
the
wind
cried
loud
in
gusts
then
low
again
three
pines
strained
darkly
runners
in
a
race
unseen
by
any
toward
the
further
woods
a
dim
harsh
noise
of
voices
rose
and
ceased
we
were
most
silent
in
those
solitudes
then
sudden
as
a
flame
the
priest
the
clotted
earth
piled
roughly
up
about
the
hacked
red
oblong
of
the
thing
short
words
in
swordlike
latin
and
a
rout
of
dreams
most
impotent
unwearying
then
like
a
blind
door
shut
on
a
carouse
the
terrible
bareness
of
the
soul
last
house
dinner
in
a
quick
lunch
room
soup
should
be
heralded
with
a
mellow
horn
blowing
clear
notes
of
gold
against
the
stars
strange
entrees
with
a
jangle
of
glass
bars
fantastically
alive
with
subtle
scorn
fish
by
a
plopping
gurgling
rush
of
waters
clear
vibrant
waters
beautifully
austere
roast
with
a
thunder
of
drums
to
stun
the
ear
a
screaming
fife
a
voice
from
ancient
slaughters
over
the
salad
let
the
woodwinds
moan
then
the
green
silence
of
many
watercresses
dessert
a
balalaika
strummed
alone
coffee
a
slow
low
singing
no
passion
stresses
such
are
my
thoughts
as
clang

bang
i
brood
and
gorge
the
sticky
mess
these
fools
call

the

a
virginia
legend

scourged

the

black
is
the
gap
below
the
plank
from
the
great
north
bank
to
the
caribbees
down
by
the
marsh
the
hemp
grows
rank
his
fear
was
on
the
seaport
towns
the
weight
of
his
hand
held
hard
the
downs
and
the
merchants
cursed
him
bitter
and
black
for
a
red
flame
in
the
wrack
was
all
of
their
ships
that
might
come
back
for
all
he
had
one
word
alone
one
clod
of
dirt
in
their
faces
thrown
the
hemp
that
shall
hang
me
is
not
grown
his
name
bestrode
the
seas
like
death
the
waters
trembled
at
his
breath
this
is
the
tale
of
how
he
fell
of
the
long
sweep
and
the
heavy
swell
and
the
rope
that
dragged
him
down
to
hell
the
fight
was
done
and
the
gutted
ship
stripped
like
a
shark
the
strip
lurched
blindly
eaten
out
with
flame
back
to
the
land
from
where
she
came
a
skimming
horror
an
eyeless
shame
and
hawk
stood
upon
his
and
saw
the
sky
and
saw
the
wreck
below
a
butt
for
sailors
jeers
white
as
the
sky
when
a
white
squall
nears
huddled
the
crowd
of
the
prisoners
over
the
bridge
of
the
tottering
plank
where
the
sea
shook
and
the
gulf
yawned
blank
they
shrieked
and
struggled
and
dropped
and
sank
pinioned
arms
and
hands
bound
fast
one
girl
alone
was
left
at
last
sir
henry
gaunt
was
a
mighty
lord
he
sat
in
state
at
the
council
board
the
governors
were
as
nought
to
him
from
one
rim
to
the
other
rim
of
his
great
plantations
flung
out
wide
like
a
purple
cloak
was
a
full
month
ride
life
and
death
in
his
white
hands
lay
and
his
only
daughter
stood
at
bay
trapped
like
a
hare
in
the
toils
that
day
he
sat
at
wine
in
his
gold
and
his
lace
and
far
away
in
a
bloody
place
hawk
came
near
and
she
covered
her
face
he
rode
in
the
fields
and
the
hunt
was
brave
and
far
away
his
daughter
gave
a
shriek
that
the
seas
cried
out
to
hear
and
he
could
not
see
and
he
could
not
save
her
white
soul
withered
in
the
mire
as
paper
shrivels
up
in
fire
and
hawk
laughed
and
he
kissed
her
mouth
and
her
body
he
took
for
his
desire
the
growing
of
the
hemp
sir
henry
stood
in
the
manor
room
and
his
eyes
were
hard
gems
in
the
gloom
and
he
said
go
dig
me
furrows
five
where
the
green
marsh
creeps
like
a
thing
alive
there
at
its
edge
where
the
rushes
thrive
and
where
the
furrows
rent
the
ground
he
sowed
the
seed
of
hemp
around
and
the
blacks
shrink
back
and
are
sore
afraid
at
the
furrows
five
that
rib
the
glade
and
the
voodoo
work
of
the
master
spade
for
a
cold
wind
blows
from
the
marshland
near
and
white
things
move
and
the
night
grows
drear
and
they
chatter
and
crouch
and
are
sick
with
fear
but
down
by
the
marsh
where
the
gray
slaves
glean
the
hemp
sprouts
up
and
the
earth
is
seen
veiled
with
a
tenuous
mist
of
green
and
hawk
still
scourges
the
caribbees
and
many
men
kneel
at
his
knees
sir
henry
sits
in
his
house
alone
and
his
eyes
are
hard
and
dull
like
stone
and
the
waves
beat
and
the
winds
roar
and
all
things
are
as
they
were
before
and
the
days
pass
and
the
weeks
pass
and
nothing
changes
but
the
grass
but
down
where
the
fireflies
are
like
eyes
and
the
damps
shudder
and
the
mists
rise
the
stand
up
toward
the
skies
and
down
from
the
poop
of
the
pirate
ship
a
body
falls
and
the
great
sharks
grip
innocent
lovely
go
in
grace
at
last
there
is
peace
upon
your
face
and
hawk
laughs
loud
as
the
corpse
is
thrown
the
hemp
that
shall
hang
me
is
not
grown
sir
henry
face
is
iron
to
mark
and
he
gazes
ever
in
the
dark
and
the
days
pass
and
the
weeks
pass
and
the
world
is
as
it
always
was
but
down
by
the
marsh
the
sickles
beam
glitter
on
glitter
gleam
on
gleam
and
the
hemp
falls
down
by
the
stagnant
stream
and
hawk
beats
up
from
the
caribbees
swooping
to
pounce
in
the
northern
seas
sir
henry
sits
sunk
deep
in
his
chair
and
white
as
his
hand
is
grown
his
hair
and
the
days
pass
and
the
weeks
pass
and
the
sands
roll
from
the
but
down
by
the
marsh
in
the
blazing
sun
the
hemp
is
smoothed
and
twisted
and
spun
the
rope
made
and
the
work
done
the
using
of
the
hemp
captain
hawk
scourged
clean
the
seas
black
is
the
gap
below
the
plank
from
the
great
north
bank
to
the
caribbees
down
by
the
marsh
the
hemp
grows
rank
he
sailed
in
the
broad
atlantic
track
and
the
ships
that
saw
him
came
not
back
and
once
again
where
the
wide
tides
ran
he
stooped
to
harry
a
merchantman
he
bade
her
stop
ten
guns
spake
true
from
her
hidden
ports
and
a
hidden
crew
lacking
his
great
ship
through
and
through
dazed
and
dumb
with
the
sudden
death
he
scarce
had
time
to
draw
a
breath
before
the
bit
deep
and
the
boarders
slew
his
crew
like
sheep
hawk
stood
up
straight
his
breast
to
the
steel
his
cutlass
made
a
bloody
wheel
his
cutlass
made
a
wheel
of
flame
they
shrank
before
him
as
he
came
and
the
bodies
fell
in
a
choking
crowd
and
still
he
thundered
out
aloud
the
hemp
that
shall
hang
me
is
not
grown
they
fled
at
last
he
was
left
alone
before
his
foe
sir
henry
stood
the
hemp
is
grown
and
my
word
made
good
and
the
cutlass
clanged
with
a
hissing
whir
on
the
lashing
blade
of
the
rapier
hawk
roared
and
charged
like
a
maddened
buck
as
the
cobra
strikes
sir
henry
struck
pouring
his
life
in
a
single
thrust
and
the
cutlass
shivered
to
sparks
and
dust
sir
henry
stood
on
the
deck
and
set
his
foot
on
his
foe
neck
then
from
the
hatch
where
the
rent
decks
slope
where
the
dead
roll
and
the
wounded
grope
he
dragged
the
serpent
of
the
rope
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
sea
was
still
the
waves
lapped
softly
hill
on
hill
and
between
one
wave
and
another
wave
the
doomed
man
cries
were
little
and
shrill
the
sea
was
blue
and
the
sky
was
calm
the
air
dripped
with
a
golden
balm
like
a
fruit
between
sea
and
sun
a
black
thing
writhed
at
a
slowly
then
and
awesomely
the
ship
sank
and
the
and
there
was
nought
between
sea
and
sun
nought
but
the
sun
and
the
sky
and
the
sea
but
down
by
the
marsh
where
the
fever
breeds
only
the
water
chuckles
and
pleads
for
the
hemp
clings
fast
to
a
dead
man
throat
and
blind
fate
gathers
back
her
seeds
poor
devil
well
i
was
tired
of
life
the
silly
folk
the
tiresome
noises
all
the
common
things
i
loved
once
crushed
me
with
an
iron
yoke
i
longed
for
the
cool
quiet
and
the
dark
under
the
common
sod
where
louts
and
kings
lie
down
serene
unheeding
careless
stark
never
to
rise
or
move
or
feel
again
filled
with
the
ecstasy
of
being
dead
i
put
the
shining
pistol
to
my
head
and
pulled
the
trigger
hard
i
felt
no
pain
no
pain
at
all
the
pistol
had
missed
fire
i
thought
then
looking
at
the
floor
i
saw
my
huddled
body
lying
there
and
awe
swept
over
me
i
trembled
and
looked
up
about
me
was
not
that
my
heart
desire
that
small
and
dark
abode
of
death
and
peace
but
all
from
which
i
sought
a
vain
release
the
sky
the
people
and
the
staring
sun
glared
at
me
as
before
i
was
undone
my
last
state
ten
times
worse
than
was
my
first
helpless
i
stood
befooled
betrayed
accursed
fettered
to
life
forever
horribly
caught
in
the
meshes
of
eternity
no
further
doors
to
break
or
bars
to
burst
ghosts
of
a
lunatic
asylum
here
where
men
eyes
were
empty
and
as
bright
as
the
blank
windows
set
in
glaring
brick
when
the
wind
strengthens
from
the
sea
and
night
drops
like
a
fog
and
makes
the
breath
come
thick
by
the
deserted
paths
the
vacant
halls
one
may
see
figures
twisted
shades
and
lean
like
the
mad
shapes
that
crawl
an
indian
screen
or
paunchy
smears
you
find
on
prison
walls
turn
the
knob
gently
there
the
thumbless
man
still
weaving
glass
and
silk
into
a
dream
although
the
wall
shows
through
him
and
the
khan
journeys
cathay
beside
a
paper
stream
a
rabbit
woman
chitters
by
the
door
chilly
the
comes
from
the
turned
sod
come
lift
the
curtain
and
be
cold
before
the
silence
of
the
eight
men
who
were

the
white
peacock

ancient

i
go
away
go
away
i
will
not
confess
to
you
his
black
biretta
clings
like
a
hangman
cap
under
his
twitching
fingers
the
beads
shiver
and
click
as
he
mumbles
in
his
corner
the
shadow
deepens
upon
him
i
will
not
confess
is
he
there
or
is
it
intenser
shadow
dark
huddled
coilings
from
the
obscene
depths
black
formless
shadow
shadow
doors
creak
from
secret
parts
of
the

come
the
scuffle
and
worry
of
rats
orange
light
drips
from
the
guttering
candles
eddying
over
the
vast
embroideries
of
the
bed
stirring
the
monstrous
tapestries
retreating
before
the
sable
impending
gloom
of
the
canopy
with
a
swift
thrust
and
sparkle
of
gold
lipping
my
hands
then
rippling
back
abashed
before
the
ominous
silences
like
the
swift
turns
and
starts
of
an
overpowered
fencer
who
sees
before
him
horror
behind
him
darkness
shadow
the
clock
jars
and
strikes
a
thin
sudden
note
like
the
sob
of
a
child
clock
buhl
clock
that
ticked
out
the
tortuous
hours
of
my
birth
clock
evil
wizened
dwarf
of
a
clock
how
many
years
of
agony
have
you
relentlessly
measured
yardstick
of

you

he
is
asleep
in
the
night
cloak
over
me
too
steals
sleep
sleep
like
a
white
mist
on
the
rotting
paintings
of
cupids
and
gods
on
the
ceiling
sleep
on
the
carven
shields
and
knots
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
oozing
blurring
outlines
obliterating
colors
death
father
father
i
must
not
sleep
it
does
not
hear
that
shadow
crouched
in
the
corner
is
it
a
shadow
one
might
think
so
indeed
save
for
the
calm
face
yellow
as
wax
that
lifts
like
the
face
of
a
drowned
man
from
the
choking
darkness
ii
out
of
the
drowsy
fog
my
body
creeps
back
to
me
it
is
the
white
time
before
dawn
moonlight
watery
pellucid
lifeless
ripples
over
the
world
the
grass
beneath
it
is
gray
the
stars
pale
in
the
sky
the
night
dew
has
fallen
an
infinity
of
little
drops
crystals
from
which
all
light
has
been
taken
glint
on
the
sighing
branches
all
is
purity
without
color
without
stir
without
passion
suddenly
a
peacock
screams
my
heart
shocks
and
stops
sweat
cold
covers
my
rigid
body
my
hair
stands
on
end
i
can
not
stir
i
can
not
speak
it
is
terror
terror
that
is
walking
the
pale
sick
gardens
and
the
eyeless
face
no
man
may
see
and
live
father
father
wake
wake
and
save
me
in
his
corner
all
is
shadow
dead
things
creep
from
the
ground
it
is
so
long
ago
that
she
died
so
long
ago
dust
crushes
her
earth
holds
her
mold
grips
her
fiends
do
you
not
know
that
she
is
dead
let
us
dance
the
pavon
she
said
the
waxlights
glittered
like
swords
on
the
polished
floor
twinkling
on
jewelled
snuffboxes
beaming
savagely
from
the
crass
gold
of
candelabra
from
the
white
shoulders
of
girls
and
the
white
powdered
wigs
of
men
all
life
was
that
dance
the
mocking
resistless
current
the
beauty
the
passion
the
perilous
madness
as
she
took
my
hand
released
it
and
spread
her
dresses
like
petals
turning
swaying
in
beauty
a
lily
bowed
by
the
rain
moonlight
she
was
and
her
body
of
moonlight
and
foam
and
her
eyes
stars
oh
the
dance
has
a
pattern
but
the
clear
grace
of
her
thrilled
through
the
notes
of
the
viols
tremulous
pleading
escaping
immortal
untamed
and
as
we
ended
she
blew
me
a
kiss
from
her
hand
like
a
drifting
white
blossom
and
the
starshine
was
gone
and
she
fled
like
a
bird
up
the
stair
underneath
the
window
a
peacock
screams
and
claws
click
scrape
like
little
lacquered
boots
on
the
rough
stone
oh
the
long
fantasy
of
the
kiss
the
ceaseless
hunger
ceaselessly
divinely
appeased
the
aching
presence
of
the
beloved
beauty
the
wisdom
the
incense
the
brightness
once
more
on
the
floor
they
danced
the
pavon
but
i
turned
to
the
garden
and
her
from
the
lighted
candles
softly
i
trod
the
lush
grass
between
the
black
hedges
of
box
softly
for
i
should
take
her
unawares
and
catch
her
arms
and
embrace
her
dear
and
startled
by
the
arbor
all
the
moonlight
flowed
in
silver
and
her
head
was
on
his
breast
she
did
not
scream
or
shudder
when
my
sword
was
where
her
head
had
lain
in
the
quiet
moonlight
but
turned
to
me
with
one
pale
hand
uplifted
all
her
satins
fiery
with
the
starshine
nacreous
shimmering
weeping
iridescent
like
the
quivering
plumage
of
a
peacock
then
her
head
drooped
and
i
gripped
her
hair
oh
soft
scented
cloud
across
my
fingers
bending
her
white
neck
back
blood
writhed
on
my
hands
i
trod
in
blood
stupidly
agaze
at
that
crumpled
heap
of
silk
and
moonlight
where
like
twitching
pinions
an
arm
twisted
palely
and
was
still
as
the
face
of
chalk
the
buhl
clock
strikes
thirty
years
christ
thirty
years
agony
agony
something
stirs
in
the
window
shattering
the
moonlight
white
wings
fan
father
father
all
its
plumage
fiery
with
the
starshine
nacreous
shimmering
weeping
iridescent
it
drifts
across
the
floor
and
mounts
the
bed
to
the
tap
of
little
satin
shoes
gazing
with
infernal
eyes
its
quick
beak
thrusting
rending
devil
crimson
screams
great
tortured
screams
shake
the
dark
canopy
the
light
flickers
the
shadow
in
the
corner
stirs
the
wax
face
lifts
the
eyes
open
a
thin
trickle
of
blood
worms
darkly
against
the
vast
red
coverlet
and
spreads
to
a
pool
on
the
floor
colors
for
the
little
man
with
the
vague
beard
and
guise
pulled
at
the
wicket
come
inside
he
said
i
show
you
all
we
got
now
it
was
size
you
wanted
oh
dry
colors
well
he
led
to
a
dim
alley
lined
with
musty
bins
and
pulled
one
fiercely
violent
and
bold
a
sudden
tempest
of
mad
shrieking
sins
scarlet
screamed
out
above
the
battered
gold
of
tins
and
i
held
my
breath
he
tugged
another
hard
and
sapphire
skies
spread
in
vast
quietude
serene
as
death
waves
like
crackled
turquoise
and
my
eyes
burnt
with
the
blinding
brilliance
of
calm
sea
we
selling
that
lot
there
out
cheap
said
he
a
minor
poet
i
am
a
shell
from
me
you
shall
not
hear
the
splendid
tramplings
of
insistent
drums
the
orbed
gold
of
the
viol
voice
that
comes
heavy
with
radiance
languorous
and
clear
yet
if
you
hold
me
close
against
the
ear
a
dim
far
whisper
rises
clamorously
the
thunderous
beat
and
passion
of
the
sea
the
slow
surge
of
the
tides
that
drown
the
mere
others
with
subtle
hands
may
pluck
the
strings
making
even
love
in
music
audible
and
earth
one
glory
i
am
but
a
shell
that
moves
not
of
itself
and
moving
sings
leaving
a
fragrance
faint
as
wine
a
tremulous
murmur
from
great
days
long
dead
the
lover
in
hell
eternally
the
choking
steam
goes
up
from
the
black
pools
of
seething
oil
how
merry
those
little
devils
are
they
stolen
the
pitchfork
from
bel
there
as
he

look
oh
look
look

oh
it
is
fair
lord
how
he
squeals
stop
it
it
well
indecent
but
funny
see
bel

they
catch
it
now
eternally
that
stifling
reek
arises
blotting
the
dome
with
smoky
terrible
towers
black
strangling
trees
whispering
obscene
things
amongst
their
branches
clutching
with
maimed
hands
or
oozing
slowly
like
blind
tentacles
up
to
the
gates
higher
than
that
heaped
brick
man
piled
to
smite
the
sun
and
all
around
are
devils
one
can
laugh
but
that
hunched
shape
the
face
one
stone
like
those
assyrian
kings
one
sees
in
carvings
watching
men
flayed
red
horribly
laughable
in
leaps
and
writhes
that
face
utterly
evil
clouded
round
with
evil
like
a
smoke
it
turns
smiles
sour
and
nero
there
the
flabby
cheeks
astrain
and
sweating
agony
long
agony
imperishable
unappeasable
for
ever
well
it
droops
the
mouth
till
i
look
up
there
one
blue
patch
no
smoke
dares
touch
sky
clear
ineffable
alive
with
light
always
the
same
before
i
never
knew
rest
and
green
peace
she
stands
there
in
the
sun
it
seems
so
quaint
she
should
have
long
gold
wings
i
never
have
got
used
folded
across
her
breast
or
fluttering
with
fierce
pure
light
like
shaken
steel
her
crown
too
well
it
queer
and
then
she
never
cared
much
for
the
harp
on
earth
here
though
she
is
all
peace
all
quiet
all
passionate
desires
the
eloquent
thunder
of
new
glad
suns
shouting
aloud
for
joy
over
fresh
worlds
and
clean
trampling
the
air
like
stooping
hawks
to
the
long
wind
of
horns
flung
from
the
bastions
of
eternity
and
she
is
the
low
lake
drowsy
and
gentle
and
good
words
spoken
from
the
tongues
of
friends
and
calmness
in
the
evening
and
deep
thoughts
falling
like
dreams
from
the
stars
solemn
mouths
all
these
they
said
she
was
unfaithful
once
or
i
remembered
it
and
so
for
that
i
lie
here
i
suppose
yes
so
they
said
you
see
she
is
so
troubled
looking
down
sorrowing
deeply
for
my
torments
i
of
course
feel
nothing
while
i
see
her
save
that
sometimes
when
i
think
the
matter
out
and
what
said
of
us
of
her
it
seems
as
if
i
must
be
here
in
heaven
and
she
then
i
grow
proud
and
suddenly
there
comes
a
splatter
of
oil
against
my
skin
hurting
this
time
and
i
forget
my
pride
and
my
face
writhes
some
day
the
little
ladder
of
white
words
that
i
build
up
up
to
her
may
fetch
me
out
meanwhile
it
is
bad
but
what
a
sense
of
humor
god
must
have
winged
man
the
moon
a
sweeping
scimitar
dipped
in
the
stormy
straits
the
dawn
a
crimson
cataract
burst
through
the
eastern
gates
the
cliffs
were
robed
in
scarlet
the
sands
were
cinnabar
where
first
two
men
spread
wings
for
flight
and
dared
the
hawk
afar
there
stands
the
cunning
workman
the
crafty
past
all
praise
the
man
who
chained
the
minotaur
the
man
who
built
the
maze
his
young
son
is
beside
him
and
the
boy
face
is
a
light
a
light
of
dawn
and
wonder
and
of
valor
infinite
their
great
vans
beat
the
cloven
air
like
eagles
they
mount
up
motes
in
the
wine
of
morning
specks
in
a
crystal
cup
and
lest
his
wings
should
melt
apace
old
daedalus
flies
low
but
icarus
beats
up
beats
up
he
goes
where
lightnings
go
he
cares
no
more
for
warnings
he
rushes
through
the
sky
braving
the
crags
of
ether
daring
the
gods
on
high
black
the
crimson
sunset
golden
cloudy
snows
with
all
adventure
in
his
heart
the
first
winged
man
arose
dropping
gold
dropping
gold
where
the
mists
of
morning
rolled
on
he
kept
his
way
undaunted
though
his
breaths
were
stabs
of
cold
through
the
mystery
of
dawning
that
no
mortal
may
behold
now
he
shouts
now
he
sings
in
the
rapture
of
his
wings
and
his
great
heart
burns
intenser
with
the
strength
of
his
desire
as
he
circles
like
a
swallow
wheeling
flaming
gyre
on
gyre
gazing
straight
at
the
sun
half
his
pilgrimage
is
done
and
he
staggers
for
a
moment
hurries
on
reels
backward
swerves
in
a
rain
of
scattered
feathers
as
he
falls
in
broken
curves
icarus
icarus
though
the
end
is
piteous
yet
forever
yea
forever
we
shall
see
thee
rising
thus
see
the
first
supernal
glory
not
the
ruin
hideous
you
were
man
you
who
ran
farther
than
our
eyes
can
scan
man
absurd
gigantic
eager
for
impossible
romance
overthrowing
all
hell
legions
with
one
warped
and
broken
lance
on
the
highest
steeps
of
space
he
will
have
his
in
those
far
terrific
regions
where
the
cold
comes
down
like
death
gleams
the
red
glint
of
his
pinions
smokes
the
vapor
of
his
breath
floating
downward
very
clear
still
the
echoes
reach
the
ear
of
a
little
tune
he
whistles
and
a
little
song
he
sings
mounting
mounting
still
triumphant
on
his
torn
and
broken
wings
music
my
friend
went
to
the
piano
spun
the
stool
a
little
higher
left
his
pipe
to
cool
picked
up
a
fat
green
volume
from
the
chest
and
propped
it
open
whitely
without
rest
his
fingers
swept
the
keys
that
flashed
like
swords
and
to
the
brute
drums
of
barbarian
hordes
roaring
and
thunderous
and
an
army
stormed
the
bastions
of
the
air
dreadful
with
banners
fire
to
slay
and
parch
marching
together
as
the
lightnings
march
and
swift
as
brazen
helms
and
cars
clanged
to
a
fierce
resurgence
of
old
wars
above
the
screaming
horns
in
state
they
passed
trampling
and
splendid
on
and
sought
the
vast
rending
the
darkness
like
a
leaping
knife
the
flame
the
noble
pageant
of
our
life
the
burning
seal
that
stamps
man
high
indenture
to
vain
attempt
and
most
forlorn
adventure
romance
and
purple
seas
and
toppling
towns
and
the
wind
valiance
crying
the
downs
that
nerves
the
silly
hand
the
feeble
brain
from
the
loose
net
of
words
to
deeds
again
and
to
all
courage
perilous
and
sharp
the
last
chord
shook
me
as
wind
shakes
a
harp
and
my
friend
swung
round
on
his
stool
and
from
gods
we
were
men
how
pretty
we
said
and
went
on
with
our
talk
again
the
innovator
a
pharaoh
speaks
i
said
why
should
a
pyramid
stand
always
dully
on
its
base
i
change
it
let
the
top
be
hid
the
bottom
take
the
and
as
i
bade
they
did
the
people
flocked
in
scores
on
scores
to
see
it
balance
on
its
tip
they
praised
me
with
the
praise
that
bores
my
godlike
mind
on
every
lip
until
it
fell
of
course
and
then
they
took
my
body
out
from
my
crushed
palace
mad
with
rage
well
half
the
town
was
wrecked
no
doubt
their
crazy
anger
to
assuage
by
dragging
it
about
the
end
foul
birds
defile
my
skull
the
new
king
praises
fill
the
land
he
clings
to
precept
simple
dull
his
pyramids
on
bases
stand
but
lord
how
usual
love
in
twilight
there
is
darkness
behind
the
light
and
the
pale
light
drips
cold
on
vague
shapes
and
figures
that
loom
like
the
carven
prows
of
proud
ships
and
the
firelight
wavers
and
changes
about
the
room
as
the
three
logs
crackle
and
burn
with
a
small
still
sound
with
dark
the
deeper
dark
of
her
hair
where
she
lies
head
pillowed
on
arm
and
one
hand
curved
round
to
shield
the
white
face
and
neck
from
the
faint
thin
glare
gently
she
breathes
and
the
long
limbs
lie
at
ease
and
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
young
slim
virginal
breast
is
as
as
the
march
of
slow
wind
through
trees
or
the
great
soft
passage
of
clouds
in
a
sky
at
rest
i
kneel
and
our
arms
enlace
and
we
kiss
long
long
i
am
drowned
in
her
as
in
sleep
there
is
no
more
pain
only
the
rustle
of
flames
like
a
broken
song
that
rings
through
the
dusty
halls
of
the
brain
one
shaking
and
fragile
moment
of
ecstasy
while
the
grey
gloom
flutters
and
beats
like
an
owl
above
and
i
would
not
move
or
speak
for
the
sea
or
the
sky
or
the
wings
of
the
miraculous
dove
the
fiddling
wood
gods
what
a
black
fierce
day
the
clouds
were
iron
wrenched
to
strange
rugged
shapes
the
red
sun
winked
over
the
rough
crest
of
the
hairy
wood
in
angry
scorn
the
grey
road
twisted
kinked
like
a
sick
serpent
seeming
to
environ
the
trees
with
magic
all
the
wood
was
still
cracked
crannied
pines
bent
like
malicious
cripples
before
the
gusty
wind
they
seemed
to
nose
nudge
poke
each
other
cackling
with
ill
mirth
enchantment
days
were
over
sh
suppose
that
crouching
log
there
where
the
white
light
stipples
should
break
its
quiet
was
that
crimson
earth
it
smirched
the
ground
like
a
lewd
whisper
danger
i
hunched
my
cloak
about
me
then
appalled
turned
ice
and
fire
by
turns
for
someone
stirred
the
brown
dry
needles
sharply
terror
crawled
along
my
spine
as
forth
there
stepped
a
stranger
and
all
the
pines
crooned
like
a
drowsy
bird
his
stock
was
black
his
great
glistened
his
fur
cuffs
ended
in
a
sheen
of
rings
and
underneath
his
coat
a
case
bulged
blackly
he
swept
his
beaver
in
a
rush
of
wings
then
took
the
fiddle
out
and
as
i
listened
tightened
and
tuned
the
yellowed
strings
hung
slackly
ping
pang
the
clear
notes
swooped
and
curved
and
darted
rising
like
gulls
then
with
a
finger
skinny
he
rubbed
the
bow
with
rosin
said
your
pardon
signor
maestro
nicolo
paganini
they
used
to
call
me
tchk
the
cold
grips
hard
on
a
poor
musician
fingers
his
lips
parted
a
tortured
soul
screamed
suddenly
and
loud
from
the
brown
quivering
case
then
faster
faster
dancing
in
whorls
wild
beating
screaming
the
music
wailed
unutterable
disaster
heartbroken
murmurs
from
pale
lips
once
proud
dead
choking
moans
from
hearts
once
nobly
dreaming
till
all
resolved
in
anguish
died
away
upon
one
minor
chord
and
was
resumed
in
anguish
fell
again
to
a
low
cry
then
rose
triumphant
where
the
white
fires
fumed
terrible
marching
trampling
reeling
gay
hurling
mad
broken
legions
down
to
die
through
everlasting
hells
the
tears
were
salt
upon
my
fingers
then
i
saw
behind
the
fury
of
the
player
all
the
trees
crouched
like
violinists
boughs
crooked
jerking
blind
sweeping
mad
bows
to
music
without
fault
grey
cheeks
to
greyer
fiddles
withered
knees
gasping
i
fled
but
still
that
devilish
tune
stunned
ears
and
brain
alike
till
clouds
of
dust
blotted
the
picture
and
the
noise
grew
dim
shaking
i
reached
the
town
and
turned
in
trust
dread
against
the
rim
black
dragon
branches
whipped
below
a
moon
portrait
of
a
boy
after
the
whipping
he
crawled
into
bed
accepting
the
harsh
fact
with
no
great
weeping
how
funny
uncle
hat
had
looked
striped
red
he
chuckled
silently
the
moon
came
sweeping
a
black
frayed
rag
of
tattered
cloud
before
in
scorning
very
pure
and
pale
she
seemed
flooding
his
bed
with
radiance
on
the
floor
fat
motes
danced
he
sobbed
closed
his
eyes
and
dreamed
warm
sand
flowed
round
him
blurts
of
crimson
light
splashed
the
white
grains
like
blood
past
the
cave
mouth
shone
with
a
large
fierce
splendor
wildly
bright
the
crooked
constellations
of
the
south
here
the
cross
swung
and
there
affronting
mars
the
centaur
stormed
aside
a
froth
of
stars
within
great
casks
like
wattled
aldermen
sighed
of
enormous
feasts
and
cloth
of
gold
glowed
on
the
walls
like
hot
desire
again
beside
webbed
purples
from
some
galleon
hold
a
black
chest
bore
the
skull
and
bones
in
white
above
a
scrawled
gunpowder
by
the
flames
decked
out
in
crimson
gemmed
with
syenite
hailing
their
fellows
with
outrageous
names
the
pirates
sat
and
diced
their
eyes
were
moons
doubloons
they
said
the
words
crashed
gold
doubloons
portrait
of
a
baby
he
lay
within
a
warm
soft
world
of
motion
colors
bloomed
and
fled
maroon
and
turquoise
saffron
red
wave
upon
wave
that
broke
and
whirled
to
vanish
in
the
gloom
perspectiveless
and
shadowy
a
bulging
world
that
had
no
walls
a
flowing
world
most
like
the
sea
compassing
all
infinity
within
a
shapeless
ebbing
room
an
endless
tide
that
swells
and
falls
he
slept
and
woke
and
slept
again
as
a
veil
drops
time
dropped
away
space
grew
a
toy
for
children
play
sleep
bolted
fast
the
gates
of
sense
he
lay
in
naked
impotence
like
a
drenched
moth
that
creeps
and
crawls
heavily
up
brown
walls
to
fall
in
wreck
her
task
undone
yet
somehow
striving
toward
the
sun
so
as
he
slept
his
hands
clenched
tighter
shut
in
the
old
way
of
the
fighter
his
feet
curled
up
to
grip
the
ground
his
muscles
tautened
for
a
bound
and
though
he
felt
and
felt
alone
strange
brightness
stirred
him
to
the
bone
cravings
to
rise
till
deeper
sleep
buried
the
hope
the
call
the
leap
a
wind
puffed
out
his
mind
faint
spark
he
was
absorbed
into
the
dark
he
woke
again
and
felt
a
surge
within
him
a
mysterious
urge
that
grew
one
hungry
flame
of
passion
the
whole
world
altered
shape
and
fashion
deceived
befooled
bereft
and
torn
he
scourged
the
heavens
with
his
scorn
lifting
a
bitter
voice
to
cry
against
the
eternal
treachery
till
suddenly
he
found
the
breast
and
ceased
and
all
things
were
at
rest
the
earth
grew
one
warm
languid
sea
and
he
a
wave
joy
tingling
crept
throughout
him
he
was
quenched
and
slept
so
while
the
moon
made
broad
her
ring
he
slept
and
cried
and
was
a
king
so
worthily
he
acted
the
endless
miracle
once
more
facing
immense
adventures
daily
he
strove
still
onward
weeping
gaily
conquered
or
fled
from
them
but
grew
as
rough
do
till
one
day
crawling
seemed
suspect
he
gripped
the
air
and
stood
erect
and
splendid
with
immortal
rage
he
entered
on
man
heritage
the
general
public
ah
did
you
once
see
shelley
plain
browning
shelley
oh
yes
i
saw
him
often
then
the
old
man
said
a
dry
smile
creased
his
face
with
many
wrinkles
that
a
great
poem
now
that
one
of
browning
shelley
shelley
plain
the
time
that
i
remember
best
is
this
a
thin
mire
crept
along
the
rutted
ways
and
all
the
trees
were
harried
by
cold
rain
that
drove
a
moment
fiercely
and
then
ceased
falling
so
slow
it
hung
like
a
grey
mist
over
the
school
the
walks
were
like
blurred
glass
the
buildings
reeked
with
vapor
black
and
harsh
against
the
deepening
darkness
of
the
sky
and
each
lamp
was
a
hazy
yellow
moon
filling
the
space
about
with
golden
motes
and
making
all
things
larger
than
they
were
one
yellow
halo
hung
above
a
door
that
gave
on
a
black
passage
round
about
struggled
a
howling
crowd
of
boys
pushing
and
jostling
like
a
stormy
sea
with
shouting
faces
turned
a
pasty
white
by
the
strange
light
for
foam
they
all
had
clods
or
slimy
balls
of
mud
a
few
gripped
stones
and
there
his
back
against
the
battered
door
his
pile
of
books
scattered
about
his
feet
stood
shelley
while
two
others
held
him
fast
and
the
clods
beat
upon
him
shelley
the
high
shouts
rang
through
all
the
corridors
mad
shelley
come
along
and
help
and
all
the
crowd
dug
madly
at
the
earth
scratching
and
clawing
at
the
streaming
mud
and
fouled
each
other
and
themselves
and
still
shelley
stood
up
his
eyes
were
like
a
flame
set
in
some
white
still
room
for
all
his
face
was
white
a
whiteness
like
no
human
color
but
white
and
dreadful
as
consuming
fire
his
hands
shook
now
and
then
like
slender
cords
which
bear
too
heavy
weights
he
did
not
speak
so
i
saw
shelley
plain
and
you
i
said
i
i
threw
straighter
than
the
most
of
them
and
had
firm
clods
i
hit
him
well
at
least
thrice
in
the
face
he
made
good
sport
that
night
road
and
hills
i
shall
go
away
to
the
brown
hills
the
quiet
ones
the
vast
the
mountainous
the
rolling
and
drowsy
my
horse
snuffs
delicately
at
the
strange
wind
he
settles
to
a
swinging
trot
his
hoofs
tramp
the
dust
the
road
winds
straightens
slashes
a
marsh
shoulders
out
a
bridge
then
again
the
hills
unchanged
innumerable
bowing
huge
round
backs
holding
secret
immense
converse
in
gusty
voices
fruitful
fecund
toiling
like
yoked
black
oxen
the
clouds
pass
like
great
slow
thoughts
and
vanish
in
the
intense
blue
my
horse
lopes
the
saddle
creaks
and
sways
a
thousand
glittering
spears
of
sun
slant
from
on
high
the
immensity
the
spaces
are
like
the
spaces
between
star
and
star
the
hills
sleep
if
i
put
my
hand
on
one
i
would
feel
the
vast
heave
of
its
breath
i
would
start
away
before
it
awakened
and
shook
the
world
from
its
shoulders
a
cicada
cry
deepens
the
hot
silence
the
hills
open
to
show
a
slope
of
poppies
ardent
noble
heroic
a
flare
a
great
flame
of
orange
giving
sleepy
brittle
scent
that
stings
the
lungs
a
creeping
wind
slips
through
them
like
a
ferret
they
bow
and
dance
answering
beauty
voice
the
horse
whinnies
i
dismount
and
tie
him
to
the
grey
worn
fence
i
set
myself
against
the
javelins
of
grass
and
sun
and
climb
the
rounded
breast
that
flows
like
a
the
summit
crackles
with
heat
there
is
no
shelter
no
hollow
from
the
flagellating
glare
i
lie
down
and
look
at
the
sky
shading
my
eyes
my
body
becomes
strange
the
sun
takes
it
and
changes
it
it
does
not
feel
it
is
like
the
body
of
another
the
air
blazes
the
air
is
diamond
small
noises
move
among
the
grass
blackly
a
hawk
mounts
mounts
in
the
inane
seeking
the
seeking
the
end
but
there
is
no
end
here
in
this
light
there
is
no
end
elegy
for
an
enemy
for
say
does
that
stupid
earth
where
they
have
laid
her
bind
still
her
sullen
mirth
mirth
which
betrayed
her
do
the
lush
grasses
hold
greenly
and
glad
that
gold
she
alone
had
smugly
the
common
crew
over
their
knitting
mourn
her
as
butchers
do
they
slitting
she
was
my
enemy
one
of
the
best
of
them
would
she
come
back
to
me
god
damn
the
rest
of
them
damn
them
the
flabby
fat
sleek
little
darlings
we
gave
them
tit
for
tat
snarlings
for
snarlings
squashy
pomposities
shocked
at
our
violence
let
not
one
tactful
hiss
break

antiquity

upon

how
she

how
she

you
she
was
a
woman
and
tender
at
times
delicate

her

one

her

tastelessly
lacking

salt

naught

me
