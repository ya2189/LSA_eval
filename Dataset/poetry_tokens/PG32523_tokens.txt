introduction
the
cautionary
stories
that
follow
have
been
chosen
from
five
books
by
elizabeth
turner
written
for
the
pleasure
and
instruction
of
our
little
grandparents
and
the
books
are
and
between
the
years
and
they
were
on
the
shelves
of
most
nurseries
although
now
they
are
rarely
to
be
met
with
there
was
also
but
from
that
nothing
has
been
taken
for
these
pages
nor
are
the
original
pictures
again
offered
except
for
these
pictures
a
frequent
change
of
title
and
a
few
trifling
alterations
for
sake
the
pieces
selected
are
now
printed
exactly
as
at
first
turner
belief
as
stated
by
master
robert
in
the
verses
called
books
better
than
toys
in
was
that
the
children
of
her
day
when
they
had
money
to
spend
and
wanted
a
real
treat
could
not
choose
anything
more
suitable
than
her
cautionary
stories
the
piece
runs
dear
as
robert
is
so
good
i
give
him
what
i
said
i
would
two
shillings
for
himself
to
spend
he
knows
the
shop
of
our
good
friend
i
know
well
the
pretty
shop
where
folks
you
know
so
often
stop
to
view
the
prints
the
windows
look
are
filled
with
toys
and
many
a
book
have
a
thousand
books
and
toys
for
little
girls
and
little
boys
at
toys
indeed
i
love
to
but
i
prefer
to
a
book
two
bright
shillings
i
suppose
will
buy
and
and
when
two
more
i
get
i
think
i
buy
and
in
our
own
time
robert
opinion
is
not
very
widely
shared
most
of
us
would
not
care
to
give
up
a
cannon
or
a
doll
in
order
that
we
might
be
cautioned
but
turner
is
not
the
less
an
entertaining
author
because
her
volumes
have
fewer
attractions
for
us
than
some
of
the
things
in
a
christmas
bazaar
she
told
her
tales
with
such
spirit
her
verses
are
so
straightforward
the
rhymes
come
so
pat
at
the
end
of
the
lines
and
you
may
beat
time
with
your
foot
and
never
be
put
out
in
another
piece
kitty
favourites
turner
wrote
the
stories
kitty
likes
so
well
and
often
asks
her
aunt
to
tell
are
all
about
good
girls
and
boys
kitty
taste
like
robert
is
no
longer
general
the
common
view
is
that
stories
about
bad
children
are
more
fun
and
therefore
i
think
you
will
be
amused
by
these
pages
whether
or
not
punishment
always
did
follow
the
offences
as
surely
and
swiftly
as
turner
declares
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
if
you
are
in
any
doubt
you
had
better
ask
your
parents
lucas
bad
boys
and
good
the
little
tom
jones
would
often
throw
stones
and
often
he
had
a
good
warning
and
now
i
will
tell
what
tommy
befell
from
his
rudeness
one
fine
summer
morning
he
was
taking
the
air
upon
trinity
square
and
as
usual
large
stones
he
was
jerking
till
at
length
a
hard
cinder
went
plump
through
a
window
where
a
party
of
ladies
were
working
tom
aunt
when
in
town
had
left
half
a
crown
for
her
nephew
her
name
was
miss
frazier
which
he
thought
to
have
spent
but
now
it
all
went
and
it
served
him
quite
right
to
the
glazier
the
foregoing
story
is
stated
to
be
founded
on
fact
a
gunpowder
plot
i
have
got
a
sad
story
to
tell
said
betty
one
day
to
mamma
be
long
before
john
is
well
on
his
eye
is
so
dreadful
a
scar
master
wilful
enticed
him
away
to
join
with
some
more
little
boys
they
went
in
the
garden
to
play
and
i
soon
heard
a
terrible
noise
master
wilful
had
laid
a
long
train
of
gunpowder
on
the
wall
it
has
put
them
to
infinite
pain
for
it
blew
up
and
injured
them
all
john
eyebrow
is
totally
bare
tom
nose
is
bent
out
of
its
place
sam
bushy
has
lost
all
his
hair
and
dick
white
is
quite
black
in
the
face
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
train
of
gunpowder
does
not
make
a
terrible
noise
it
makes
hardly
any
noise
at
all
a
mere
and
though
john
sam
bushy
and
dick
white
are
shown
to
have
been
hurt
as
they
might
have
been
a
train
of
gunpowder
could
not
bend
tom
nose
it
could
only
burn
it
probably
turner
did
not
often
play
with
explosives
herself
and
therefore
did
not
know
master
wilful
seems
to
have
escaped
altogether
peter
imitates
the
clown
poor
peter
was
burnt
by
the
poker
one
day
when
he
made
it
look
pretty
and
red
for
the
beautiful
sparks
made
him
think
it
fine
play
to
lift
it
as
high
as
his
head
but
somehow
it
happen
his
finger
and
thumb
were
terribly
scorched
by
the
heat
and
he
scream
out
aloud
for
his
mother
to
come
and
stamp
on
the
floor
with
his
feet
now
if
peter
had
minded
his
mother
command
his
fingers
would
not
have
been
sore
and
he
promised
again
as
she
bound
up
his
hand
to
play
with
hot
pokers
no
more
ben
heavy
punishment
is
sad
when
boys
are
to
benefit
by
kind
advice
no
little
child
of
virtuous
mind
should
need
receive
a
caution
twice
the
baker
on
a
pony
came
oft
us
by
them
and
butchers
too
and
little
ben
was
much
to
blame
for
doing
what
he
should
not
do
they
told
him
to
mount
the
horse
alas
he
did
away
they
flew
in
vain
he
pull
with
all
his
force
the
pony
ran
a
mile
or
two
at
length
poor
little
ben
was
thrown
ah
who
will
pity
who
to
blame
alas
the
fault
is
all
his
own
poor
little
ben
for
life
is
lame
the
sweep
sweep
sweep
sweep
cries
little
jack
with
brush
and
bag
upon
his
back
and
black
from
head
to
foot
while
daily
as
he
goes
along
sweep
sweep
sweep
sweep
is
all
his
song
beneath
his
load
of
soot
but
then
he
was
not
always
black
oh
no
he
once
was
pretty
jack
and
had
a
kind
papa
but
silly
child
he
ran
to
play
too
far
from
home
a
long
long
way
and
did
not
ask
mamma
so
he
was
lost
and
now
must
creep
up
chimneys
crying
sweep
sweep
sweep
this
was
written
in
the
days
when
little
boys
like
tom
in
were
sent
actually
up
the
chimneys
to
clean
them
out
the
fighting
in
the
schoolroom
the
boys
all
heard
a
great
noise
charles
moore
had
just
finish
his
writing
so
ran
out
to
play
and
saw
a
sad
fray
tom
bell
and
john
wilson
were
fighting
he
cried
let
be
gone
oh
come
away
john
we
want
you
to
stand
at
the
wicket
and
you
master
bell
we
want
you
as
well
for
we
all
of
us
going
to
cricket
our
playmates
no
doubt
will
shortly
be
out
for
you
know
that
at
twelve
study
ceases
and
you
find
better
fun
in
play
ten
to
one
than
in
knocking
each
other
to
pieces
the
good
scholar
joseph
west
had
been
told
that
if
when
he
grew
old
he
had
not
learned
rightly
to
spell
though
his
writing
were
good
not
be
understood
and
joe
said
i
will
learn
my
task
well
and
he
made
it
a
rule
to
be
silent
at
school
and
what
do
you
think
came
to
pass
why
he
learnt
it
so
fast
that
from
being
the
last
he
soon
was
the
first
in
the
class
the
good
scholar
fights
one
afternoon
as
joseph
west
the
boy
who
learnt
his
lesson
best
was
trying
how
his
whip
would
crack
by
chance
he
hit
sam
headstrong
back
enraged
he
flew
and
gave
poor
joe
with
all
his
might
a
sudden
blow
nor
would
he
listen
to
one
word
when
joe
endeavoured
to
be
heard
joe
finding
him
resolved
to
fight
for
what
was
accidental
quite
although
he
never
fought
before
beat
headstrong
till
he
have
no
more
the
death
of
the
good
scholar
foe
my
dear
little
ned
his
grandmamma
said
i
think
i
have
caution
you
twice
i
hope
you
take
heed
i
do
love
indeed
and
i
beg
you
not
venture
on
ice
good
skaters
i
know
on
the
ice
often
go
and
also
will
others
entice
when
there
has
not
been
frost
two
days
at
the
most
and
when
very
thin
is
the
ice
he
went
to
the
brook
resolv
but
to
look
and
though
he
could
slide
very
nice
and
the
slides
were
he
knew
be
wrong
so
he
did
not
then
go
on
the
ice
he
wisely
behav
and
his
life
thus
he
sav
for
sam
headstrong
who
took
advice
went
where
it
was
thin
alas
he
fell
in
he
sank
and
went
under
the
ice
robert
thoughtless
brothers
robert
when
an
infant
heard
now
and
then
a
naughty
word
spoken
in
a
random
way
by
his
brothers
when
at
play
was
the
baby
then
to
blame
when
he
tried
to
lisp
the
same
no
he
could
not
whilst
so
young
know
what
words
were
right
or
wrong
but
for
boys
who
better
knew
punishment
was
justly
due
which
the
thoughtless
brothers
met
in
a
way
they
wo
forget
joe
light
punishment
as
joe
was
at
play
near
the
cupboard
one
day
when
he
thought
no
one
saw
but
himself
how
sorry
i
am
he
ate
raspberry
jam
and
currants
that
stood
on
the
shelf
his
mother
and
john
to
the
garden
had
gone
to
gather
ripe
pears
and
ripe
plums
what
joe
was
about
his
mother
found
out
when
she
look
at
his
fingers
and
thumbs
and
when
they
had
dined
said
to
joe
you
will
find
it
is
better
to
let
things
alone
these
plums
and
these
pears
no
naughty
boy
shares
who
meddles
with
fruit
not
his
own
falsehood
corrected
when
jacky
drown
our
poor
cat
tib
he
told
a
very
naughty
fib
and
said
he
had
not
drown
her
but
truth
is
always
soon
found
out
no
one
but
jack
had
been
about
the
place
where
thomas
found
her
and
thomas
saw
him
with
the
cat
though
jacky
did
not
know
of
that
and
told
papa
the
trick
he
saw
him
take
a
slender
string
and
round
poor
pussy
neck
then
swing
a
very
heavy
brick
his
parents
being
very
sad
to
find
they
had
a
boy
so
bad
to
say
what
was
not
true
determined
to
correct
him
then
and
never
was
he
known
again
such
naughty
things
to
do
the
superior
boys
tom
and
charles
once
took
a
walk
to
see
a
pretty
lamb
and
as
they
went
began
to
talk
of
little
naughty
sam
who
beat
his
younger
brother
bill
and
threw
him
in
the
dirt
and
when
his
poor
mamma
was
ill
he
teased
her
for
a
squirt
and
i
said
tom
wo
play
with
sam
although
he
has
a
top
but
here
the
pretty
little
lamb
to
talking
put
a
stop
george
curious
taste
on
george
birthday
was
such
a
display
he
was
dress
in
a
new
suit
of
clothes
and
look
so
genteel
with
his
buttons
of
steel
and
felt
quite
like
a
man
i
suppose
now
at
tea
with
much
care
he
partakes
of
his
share
nor
spills
it
as
careless
boys
do
he
is
always
so
clean
and
so
fit
to
be
seen
that
his
clothes
you
would
think
were
just
new
yet
george
loves
to
play
and
is
lively
and
gay
but
is
careful
of
spoiling
his
dress
so
a
pinafore
wears
which
he
likes
he
declares
and
i
think
he
is
right
i
confess
thomas
brown
disappointment
young
alfred
with
a
pack
of
cards
could
make
a
pancake
build
a
house
would
make
a
regiment
of
guards
and
sit
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
a
silly
boy
one
thomas
brown
who
came
to
dine
and
spend
the
day
took
great
delight
to
throw
it
down
then
rudely
laughing
ran
away
and
what
did
little
alfred
do
he
knew
lamenting
was
in
vain
so
patiently
and
wisely
too
he
smiling
built
it
up
again
considerate
philip
when
philip
good
mamma
was
ill
the
servant
begg
he
would
be
still
because
the
doctor
and
the
nurse
had
said
that
noise
would
make
her
worse
at
night
when
philip
went
to
bed
he
kiss
mamma
and
said
my
dear
mamma
i
never
will
make
any
noise
when
you
are
the
models
as
dick
and
bryan
were
at
play
at
trap
it
came
to
pass
dick
struck
the
ball
and
far
away
he
broke
a
pane
of
glass
though
much
alarmed
they
did
not
run
but
walk
up
to
the
spot
and
offer
for
the
damage
done
what
money
they
had
got
when
accidents
like
this
arise
dear
children
this
rely
on
all
honest
honourable
boys
will
act
like
dick
and
bryan
politeness
good
little
boys
should
never
say
i
will
and
give
me
these
oh
no
that
never
is
the
way
but
mother
if
you
please
and
if
you
please
to
sister
anne
good
boys
to
say
are
ready
and
yes
sir
to
a
gentleman
and
yes
to
a
lady
richard
reformation
miss
lucy
was
a
charming
child
she
never
said
i
wont
if
little
dick
her
playthings
she
said
pray
dicky
do
he
took
her
waxen
doll
one
day
and
bang
it
round
and
round
then
tore
its
legs
and
arms
away
and
threw
them
on
the
ground
his
good
mamma
was
angry
quite
and
lucy
tears
ran
down
but
dick
went
supperless
that
night
and
since
has
better
grown
james
sacrifice
little
james
full
of
play
went
shooting
one
day
not
thinking
his
sister
was
nigh
the
arrow
was
low
but
the
wind
raised
it
so
that
it
hit
her
just
over
the
eye
this
good
little
lad
was
exceedingly
sad
at
the
pain
he
had
given
his
sister
he
look
at
her
eye
and
said
emma
do
cry
and
then
too
he
tenderly
kiss
her
she
could
not
then
speak
and
it
cost
her
a
week
before
she
recover
her
sight
and
james
burn
his
bow
and
his
arrows
and
so
i
think
little
james
acted
right
the
excellent
lord
mayor
oh
dear
papa
cried
little
joe
how
beautiful
the
lord
mayor
show
in
that
gold
coach
the
lord
mayor
see
how
happy
he
must
be
my
dear
the
careful
parent
said
let
not
strange
notions
fill
your
head
is
not
the
gold
that
we
possess
that
constitutes
our
happiness
the
lord
mayor
when
a
little
boy
his
time
did
properly
employ
and
as
he
grew
from
youth
to
man
to
follow
goodness
was
his
plan
and
that
the
cause
they
love
him
so
and
cheer
him
all
the
way
they
go
they
love
him
for
his
smiling
face
more
than
for
all
his
gold
and
lace
clever
little
thomas
when
thomas
poole
first
went
to
school
he
was
but
scarcely
seven
yet
knew
as
well
to
read
and
spell
as
most
boys
of
eleven
he
took
his
seat
and
wrote
quite
neat
and
never
idly
acted
and
then
beside
he
multiplied
divided
and
subtracted
his
master
said
and
stroked
his
head
if
thus
you
persevere
my
little
friend
you
may
depend
upon
a
prize
next
year
william
escape
is
winter
cold
winter
and
william
has
been
to
look
at
the
place
on
the
pool
where
henry
was
drown
by
the
ice
breaking
in
about
half
a
mile
from
the
school
and
henry
was
told
on
that
very
same
day
he
must
not
go
into
that
field
but
then
as
he
thought
if
he
did
disobey
the
fault
might
for
once
be
conceal
a
lesson
for
william
who
hangs
down
his
head
without
any
spirits
for
play
his
favourite
friend
and
companion
is
dead
because
would
have
his
own
good
girls
and
bad

afterthought
yesterday
rebecca
mason
in
the
parlour
by
herself
broke
a
handsome
china
basin
plac
upon
the
quite
alarm
she
thought
of
going
very
quietly
away
not
a
single
person
knowing
of
her
being
there
that
day
but
rebecca
recollected
she
was
taught
deceit
to
shun
and
the
moment
she
reflected
told
her
mother
what
was
done
who
commended
her
behaviour
lov
her
better
and
forgave
her
a
hint
to
mary
anne
mamma
dear
mamma
cried
in
haste
mary
anne
as
into
the
parlour
she
eagerly
ran
i
hear
that
a
giant
is
just
come
to
town
so
tall
he
is
often
obliged
to
stoop
down
oh
pray
let
us
see
him
oh
do
let
us
go
indeed
dear
mamma
he
a
wonderful
show
you
are
earnest
my
love
and
shall
not
be
denied
her
truly
affectionate
mother
replied
a
lady
this
morning
has
also
arrived
who
of
arms
and
of
legs
from
her
birth
was
deprived
yet
is
in
a
number
of
ways
as
expert
as
if
she
were
able
these
limbs
to
exert
we
visit
miss
beffin
and
then
i
speak
of
the
giant
and
lady
again
you
are
not
mistaken
his
overgrown
size
we
can
not
behold
without
feeling
surprise
whilst
beffin
example
most
forcibly
stands
a
silent
rebuke
to
all
how
to
write
a
letter
maria
intended
a
letter
to
write
but
could
not
begin
as
she
thought
to
indite
so
went
to
her
mother
with
pencil
and
slate
containing
dear
sister
and
also
a
date
with
nothing
to
say
my
dear
girl
do
not
think
of
wasting
your
time
over
paper
and
ink
but
certainly
this
is
an
excellent
way
to
try
with
your
slate
to
find
something
to
say
i
will
give
you
a
rule
said
her
mother
my
dear
just
think
for
a
moment
your
sister
is
here
and
what
would
you
tell
her
consider
and
then
though
silent
your
tongue
you
can
speak
with
your
pen
news
for
papa
when
sarah
papa
was
from
home
a
great
way
she
attempted
to
write
him
a
letter
one
day
first
ruling
the
paper
an
excellent
plan
in
all
proper
order
miss
sarah
began
she
said
she
lamented
sincerely
to
tell
that
her
dearest
mamma
had
been
very
unwell
that
the
story
was
long
but
that
when
he
came
back
he
would
hear
of
the
shocking
behaviour
of
jack
though
an
error
or
two
we
by
chance
may
detect
it
was
better
than
treating
papa
with
neglect
and
sarah
when
older
we
know
will
learn
better
and
write
single
i
with
a
capital
letter
maria
charity
maria
aunt
who
lived
in
town
once
wrote
a
letter
to
her
niece
and
sent
wrapp
up
a
new

a
pretty
maria
jump
with
joy
and
ran
to
tell
her
sister
the
good
news
she
said
i
mean
to
buy
a
fan
come
come
along
with
me
to
choose
they
quickly
tied
their
hats
and
of
yellow
lilac
pink
and
green
but
far
the
sisters
had
not
walk
before
the
saddest
sight
was
seen
upon
the
ground
a
poor
lame
man
helpless
and
old
had
tumbled
down
she
thought
no
more
about
the
fan
but
gave
to
him
her
new

neglected
turk

alice
was
quietly
seated
at
work
when
susan
her
cousin

quite
in
a
hurry
exclaiming

turk

smile
of
approval
and
favour
pride
and
priggishness

some
little
girls
would
like
to
be
as
fine
said
fanny
your
papa
is
true
your
dress

well
afford
but
if
you
think
i
envy
you
i
do
upon
my
word
my
father
loves
to
see
me
dress
quite
modest
neat
and
clean
in
plain
white
muslin
i
confess
i
happy
as
a
queen
parents
after
pleasures
roam
not
like
papa
for
he
delights
to
stay
with
me
at
home
do
you
envy
me
how
to
look
when
speaking
louisa
my
love
mrs
manners
began
i
fear
you
are
learning
to
stare
to
avoid
looking
bold
i
must
give
you
a
plan
quite
easy
to
practise
with
care
it
is
not
a
lady
or
gentleman
eyes
you
should
look
at
whenever
address
whilst
hearing
them
speak
or
in
making
replies
to
look
at
the
is
the
best
this
method
is
modest
and
easy
to
learn
when
children
are
glad
to
be
taught
and
ah
what
a
pleasure
it
is
in
return
to
speak
and
to
look
as
you
ought
isabella

once
as
little
isabella
ventured
with
a
large
umbrella
out
upon
a
rainy
day
she
was
nearly
blown
away
sadly
frighten
then
was
she
for
was
very
near
the
sea
and
the
wind
was
very
high
but
alas
no
friend
was
nigh
luckily
her
good
mamma
saw
her
trouble
from
afar
running
just
in
time
she
caught
her
pretty
little
flying
daughter
this
story
recalls
the
adventures
of
robert
at
the
end
of
robert
however
was
not

maria
snubbed
maria
had
an
aunt
at
leeds
for
whom
she
made
a
purse
of
beads
was
neatly
done
by
all
allow
and
praise
soon
made
her
vain
and
proud
her
mother
willing
to
repress
this
strong
conceit
of
cleverness
said
i
will
show
you
if
you
please
a
honeycomb
the
work
of
bees
yes
look
within
their
hive
and
then
examine

and
you
will
admit

greater

matilda
extravagance
that
beautiful
cottage
not
far
from
the
road
in
holiday
time
was
matilda
abode
who
taken
one
day
by
her
aunt
to
the
town
had
put
in
her
purse
rather
more
than
a
crown
was
either
to
keep
or
to
give
or
to
spend
in
what
she
lik
best
for
herself
or
a
friend
soon
trinkets
and
ribbons
in
turn
made
her
stop
to
purchase
a
trifle
at
every
shop
before
she
remember
the
canvas
and
wool
she
intended
to
buy
when
her
purse
appear
full
then
wanted
to
borrow
a
favour
her
aunt
refus
because
very
improper
to
grant
young
ladies
extravagance
ought
to
be
met
by
teaching
them
to
run
into
papa
watchfulness
mamma
had
ordered
ann
the
maid
miss
caroline
to
wash
and
put
on
with
her
clean
white
frock
a
handsome
muslin
sash
but
caroline
began
to
cry
for
what
you
can
not
think
she
said
oh
that
an
ugly
sash
i
have
my
pretty
pink
papa
who
in
the
parlour
heard
her
make
the
noise
and
rout
that
instant
went
to
caroline
to
whip
her
there
no
doubt
isabella
defeat
mamma
i
quite
dislike
these
shoes
i
hope
you
send
them
back
they
are
so
ugly
i
should
choose
much
prettier
than
black
i
thought
you
mention
blue
or
buff
when
ordering
a
pair
or
green
i
should
like
well
enough
but
black
i
can
not
bear
young
isabella
prattle
her
mother
soon
a
wish
that
she
would
say
no
more
since
ones
suited
best
which
when
the
little
lady
heard
she
did
not
say
another
word
the
two
patients
miss
lucy
wright
though
not
so
tall
was
just
the
age
of
sophy
ball
but
i
have
always
understood
miss
sophy
was
not
half
so
good
for
as
they
both
had
faded
teeth
their
teacher
sent
for
doctor
heath
but
sophy
made
a
dreadful
rout
and
would
not
have
hers
taken
out
but
lucy
wright
endured
the
pain
nor
did
she
ever
once
complain
her
teeth
return
quite
sound
and
white
while
sophy
ached
both
day
and
night
fanny
bad
habit
fanny
fletcher
is
forgetful
never
wilful
in
her
life
neither
obstinate
nor
fretful
loving
truth
and
shunning
strife
from
a
girl
of
so
much
merit
may
we
not
in
time
expect
she
will
show
a
proper
spirit
wrong
habit
to
correct
friends
will
say
it
is
a
pity
if
her
resolution
fails
fanny

both
good
and

when
she
does
not

her
nails
sarah
danger
those
who
saw
miss
sarah
gaping
in
the
middle
of
the
day
this
remark
were
often
making
on
this
dull
and
drowsy
way
half
asleep
and
yet
she
waken
if
poor
child
she
is
not
sick
some
good
method
must
be
taken
to
correct
this
idle
trick
the
hoyden
miss
agnes
had
two
or
three
dolls
and
a
box
to
hold
all
her
bonnets
and
tippets
and
frocks
in
a
red
leather
that
snapp
when
it
shut
she
had
needles
to
sew
with
and
scissors
to
cut
but
agnes
liked
better
to
play
with
rude
boys
than
work
with
her
needle
or
play
with
her
toys
young
ladies
should
always
appear
neat
and
clean
yet
agnes
was
seldom
dress
fit
to
be
seen
i
saw
her
one
morning
attempting
to
throw
a
very
large
stone
when
it
fell
on
her
toe
the
boys
who
were
present
and
saw
what
was
done
set
up
a
loud
laugh
and
they
call
it
fine
fun
but
i
took
her
home
and
the
doctor
soon
came
and
agnes
i
fear
will
a
long
time
be
lame
as
from
morning
till
night
she
laments
very
much
that
now
when
she
walks
she
must
lean
on
a
crutch
and
she
told
her
dear
father
a
thousand
times
that
she
never
will
play
with
rude
boys
any
more
hoyden
is
not
used
now
we
say
tomboy
the
giddy
girl
miss
helen
was
always
too
giddy
to
heed
what
her
mother
had
told
her
to
shun
for
frequently
over
the
street
in
full
speed
she
would
cross
where
the
carriages
run
and
out
she
would
go
to
a
very
deep
well
to
look
at
the
water
below
how
naughty
to
run
to
a
dangerous
well
where
her
mother
forbade
her
to
go
one
morning
intending
to
take
but
one
peep
her
foot
slipp
away
from
the
ground
unhappy
misfortune
the
water
was
deep
and
giddy
miss
helen
was
drown
a
warning
to
frances
as
frances
was
playing
and
turning
around
her
head
grew
so
giddy
she
fell
to
the
ground
was
well
that
she
was
not
much
hurt
but
o
what
a
pity
her
frock
was
so
that
had
you
beheld
the
unfortunate
child
you
had
seen
her
all
cover
with
dirt
her
mother
was
sorry
and
said
do
not
cry
and
mary
shall
wash
you
and
make
you
quite
dry
if
you
promise
to
turn
round
no
more
what
not
in
the
parlour
the
little
girl
said
no
not
in
the
parlour
for
lately
i
read
of
a
girl
who
was
hurt
with
the
door
she
was
playing
and
turning
until
her
poor
head
fell
against
the
hard
door
and
it
very
much
bled
and
i
heard
camomile
tell
that
he
put
on
a
plaster
and
cover
it
up
then
he
gave
her
some
tea
that
was
bitter
to
sup
or
perhaps
it
had
never
been
well
playing
with
fire
the
friends
of
little
mary
green
are
now
in
deep
distress
the
family
will
soon
be
seen
to
wear
a
mournful
dress
it
seems
from
litter
on
the
floor
she
had
been
lighting
straws
which
caught
the
muslin
frock
she
wore
a
sad
event
to
cause
her
screams
were
loud
and
quickly
heard
and
remedies
applied
but
all
in
vain
she
scarcely
again
before
she
died
how
to
heal
a
burn
o
we
have
had
a
sad
mishap
as
clara
lay
in
nurse
lap
too
near
the
fire
the
chair
did
stand
a
coal
flew
out
and
burnt
her
hand
it
must
have
flown
above
the
guard
it
came
so
quick
and
hit
so
hard
and
would
you
think
it
raised
a
blister
o
how
she
cried
poor
little
sister
poor
thing
i
grieved
to
see
it
swell
what
will
you
put
to
make
it
well
why
said
mamma
i
really
think
some
scraped
potato
or
some
ink
a
little
vinegar
or
brandy
whichever
nurse
can
find
most
handy
all
these
are
good
my
little
daughter
but
nothing
better
than
cold
water
mary
anne
kindness
how
mischievous
it
was
when
will
push
his
young
sister
down
the
hill
then
ran
away
a
naughty
boy
although
he
heard
her
sadly
cry
their
mother
who
was
walking
out
saw
the
rude
trick
and
heard
him
shout
with
gentle
voice
but
angry
nod
she
threaten

with
the
rod
but
mary
anne
afraid
of
this
begg
they
might
now
be
friends
and
kiss
she
said
mamma
i
feel
no
pain
and
willy
wo
do
so
again
then
willy
call
his
sister
good
and
said
he
never
never

ambitious
sophy
miss
sophy
one
fine
sunny
day
left
her
work
and
ran
away
when
she
reach
the
she
found
it
lock
but
would
not
wait
so
tried
to
climb
and
scramble
a
gate
as
high
as
any
door
but
little
girls
should
never
climb
and
sophy
wo
another
time
for

upon
the
highest
rail
her
frock
was
caught
upon
a
nail
she
lost
her
hold
and
sad
to
tell

hurt
and
bruised
for
down
she
fell
dressed
or
undressed
when
children
are
naughty
and
will
not
be

pray
what
do
you
think
is
the
way
why
often
i
really
believe
it
is
best
to
keep
them
in
all
day
but
then
they
can
have
no
good
breakfast
to
eat
nor
walk
with
their
mother
or
aunt
at
dinner
they
have
neither
pudding
nor
meat
nor
anything
else
that
they
want
then
who
would
be
naughty
and
sit
all
the
day
in
unfit
to
be
seen
and
pray
who
would
lose
all
their
pudding
and

you
are
troublesome
anne

her
aunt

me
to
bring
you
abroad
and
now
you
are
cross
and
pretend
that
you
want
to
be
carried
the
rest
of
the
road
i
hope
you
know
better
than
cry
in
the
street
the
people
will
think
it
so
odd
and
if
birch
we
should
happen
to
meet
she
will
ask
if
we
want
a
new
rod
then
dry
up
your
tears
with
a
smile
on
your
face
you
will
speak
in
a
different
tune
and
now
you
have
cleverly
mended
your
pace
we
shall
both
be
at
home

soon

said
i
will

must
have
frances
whipp
for
oh
how
naughty
is
to

but
worse
much
worse
to

cruelty
the
harmless

young

delight

at

he
gently

the
result
of
cruelty
jack
parker
was
a
cruel
boy
for
mischief
was
his
sole
employ
and
much
it
grieved
his
friends
to
find
his
thoughts
so
wickedly
inclined
he
thought
it
clever
to
deceive
and
often
ramble
without
leave
and
animal
he
met
he
dearly
loved
to
plague
and
fret
but
all
such
boys
unless
they
mend
may
come
to
an
unhappy
end
like

got
a
fractured
skull

bellowing

furious
bull

i
like
you

in
a
prettier
way
than

for
me
that
and
me
this
is
not
the
best
way
to
be
heard
to
make
ann

a
little
miss
must
add
another
little
word
pray
give
me
ann
a
glass
of
beer
jane
blushing
said
her
mother
smiled
now
ann

quickly
bring
it
here

you
ask
properly
my
child
you
little
misses
masters
too
who
wish
to

a
share
of
praise
pray

jane
and
always
do
directly
what
your
mother
says
the
cook
rebuke
james
went
to
the
door
of
the
kitchen
and
said
cook
give
me
this
moment
some
honey
and
bread
then
fetch
me
a
glass
or
a
cup
of
good
beer
why
cook
you
do
stir
and
i
sure
you
must
hear
indeed
master
james
was
the
cook
right
reply
to
answer
such
language
i
feel
rather
shy
i
hear
you
quite
plainly
but
wait
till
you
choose
to
civilly
ask
when
i
shall
not
refuse
what
a
pity
young
boys
should
indulge
in
this
way
whilst
knowing
so
well
what
is
proper
to
say
as
if
civil
words
in
a
tone
were
learn
to
be
us
in
the
parlour
alone
the
lost
pudding
miss
kitty
was
rude
at
the
table
one
day
and
would
not
sit
still
on
her
seat
regardless
of
all
that
her
mother
could
say
from
her
chair
little
kitty
kept
running
away
all
the
time
they
were
eating
their
meat
as
soon
as
she
saw
that
the
beef
was
remov
she
ran
to
her
chair
in
great
haste
but
her
mother
such
giddy
behaviour
by
sending
away
the
sweet
pudding
she
lov
without
giving
kitty
one
taste
sammy
smith
sad
fate
sammy
smith
would
drink
and
eat
from
morning
until
night
he
filled
his
mouth
so
full
of
meat
it
was
a
shameful
sight
sometimes
he
gave
a
book
or
toy
for
apple
cake
or
plum
and
grudged
if
any
other
boy
should
taste
a
single
crumb
indeed
he
ate
and
drank
so
fast
and
used
to
stuff
and
cram
the
name
they
call
him
by
at
last
was
often
greedy
sam
stupid
william
william
has
a
silly
trick
on
everything
his
hand
he
lays
he
made
himself
extremely
sick
one
morning
by
his
greedy
ways
i
promised
him
i
write
it
here
although
he
owns
he
much
to
blame
that
all
may
read
it
far
and
near
lest
other
boys
should
do
the
same
no
scatter
bits
his
eye
can
pass
he
tastes
and
sips
he
comes
he
empties
everybody
glass
and
picks
up
everybody
crumbs
he
not
do
so
again
i
hope
he
has
been
warn
enough
i
think
for
once
he
ate
a
piece
of
soap
and
sipp
for
wine
a
glass
of
ink
poisonous
fruit
as
tommy
and
his
sister
jane
were
walking
down
a
shady
lane
they
saw
some
berries
bright
and
red
that
hung
around
and
overhead
and
soon
the
bough
they
bended
down
to
make
the
scarlet
fruit
their
own
and
part
they
ate
and
part
in
play
they
threw
about
and
flung
away
but
long
they
had
not
been
at
home
before
poor
jane
and
little
tom
were
taken
sick
and
ill
to
bed
and
since
i
heard
they
both
are
dead
alas
had
tommy
understood
that
fruit
in
lanes
is
seldom
good
he
might
have
walked
with
little
jane
again
along
the
shady
lane

very
delightful
stories
they
are
the
great
difficulty
with
books
for
children
is
that
they
are
often
so
large
a
difficulty
which
in
the
case
of
the
bound
annual
really
assumes
formidable
proportions
especially
to
the
uncle
or
aunt
who
is
seized
by
the
juvenile
and
coerced
into
reading
aloud
but
this
book
is
quite
perfect
from
that
point
of
view
for
it

no
