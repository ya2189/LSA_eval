flower
babies
i
know
where
some
babies
are
snug
asleep
all
in
a
long
straight
row
and
i
know
that
someone
is
singing
to
them
singing
soft
and
low
and
all
night
long
the
babies
sleep
and
dream
baby
dreams
you
know
and
the
little
stars
are
listening
too
to
the
singing
soft
and
low
shall
i
tell
you
where
these
babies
are
you
never
can
guess
i
know
and
shall
i
tell
you
just
who
it
is
that
is
singing
soft
and
low
why
the
little
flowers
are
the
babies
dear
out
in
the
garden
you
know
and
the
big
is
singing
to
them
singing
soft
and
low
the
little
i
wonder
dear
if
you
ever
heard
about
the
queer
little
men
who
come
slipping
in
when
the
light
grows
dim
and
it
again
they
the
funniest
cutest
little
elfin
men
and
they
dress
in
the
strangest
way
with
queer
little
peak√®d
caps
on
their
heads
and
tight
little
suits
of
grey
and
each
little
fellow
has
what
do
you
think
a
fat
little
bag
full
of
sand
hung
over
his
shoulder
and
he
grabs
it
tight
with
his
funny
little
elfin
hand
and
when
you
are
thinking
about
them
at
all
these
funny
little
creep
up
close
and
sprinkle
some
grains
on
your
eyes
and
then
you
go
straight
to
sleep
at
least
that
what
my
nursie
told
me
when
i
was
little
like
you
but
i
think
perhaps
was
a
fairy
tale
so
i
not
very
certain
it
true
for
she
laughed
when
i
wanted
to
see
one
and
said
there
were
some
things
she
could
get
and
i
watched
and
watched
but
i
never
seen
a
single
little
yet
star
babies
do
you
see
those
cunning
little
white
clouds
floating
right
up
there
in
the
sky
just
guess
if
you
can
what
those
little
white
clouds
are
going
to
do
by
and
by
and
you
see
the
shining
bright
stars
way
up
there
and
the
little
wee
baby
ones
too
well
the
big
bright
stars
are
the
mamas
you
know
and
what
do
you
they
do
well
all
of
those
little
wee
baby
stars
are
sleepy
as
they
can
be
so
they
must
be
put
all
snug
in
their
beds
and
covered
up
nice
you
see
and
those
little
white
clouds
floating
up
in
the
sky
are
the
dear
little
covers
that
go
on
the
wee
little
beds
of
the
baby
stars
to
keep
them
all
warm
you
know
the
fairies
ball
listen
dearie
what
do
you
suppose
i
just
heard
over
in
the
arbor
there
where
the
roses
are
nodding
and
whispering
low
all
in
the
soft
evening
air
why
the
fairies
are
coming
to
have
a
dance
right
in
our
garden
dear
for
this
is
night
you
know
the
elfin
time
of
the
year
all
the
fairies
are
coming
from
everywhere
to
dance
in
the
moonlight
here
and
they
going
to
dress
in
the
loveliest
things
you
ever
dreamed
of
dear
there
be
the
fairies
of
the
moon
of
course
all
dressed
in
misty
white
with
beautiful
silvery
gauzy
wings
and
a
wand
for
light
they
skip
along
down
the
moonbeams
dear
so
i
heard
the
roses
say
a
lovely
dancing
shimmering
band
twinkling
all
the
way
and
the
little
fairies
of
the
clouds
you
know
they
coming
too
with
the
rest
and
what
will
you
say
when
i
tell
you
dear
how
those
darling
little
fairies
be
dressed
why
they
just
going
to
bundle
themselves
all
up
in
lovely
sunset
clouds
and
come
trailing
along
down
the
sky
to
us
in
beautiful
shining
crowds
some
of
the
very
very
littlest
ones
will
dress
in
pinky
white
and
some
of
the
others
in
orange
and
red
all
fringed
with
golden
light
and
then
there
the
dear
little
too
you
ca
guess
how
sweet
they
be
in
little
dresses
of
white
all
hung
with
pearls
from
the
sea
and
the
little
queen
of
the
flowers
be
there
sitting
up
on
her
lovely
throne
just
wait
till
i
tell
you
about
it
dear
you
wish
was
your
very
own
the
darling
little
fairies
of
the
snow
made
it
dear
all
glistening
frosty
white
made
it
up
in
their
home
in
cloudland
there
and
they
bringing
it
down
it
just
like
a
beautiful
frosty
cave
all
sparkling
with
diamonds
dear
and
frosty
that
glisten
bright
out
in
the
moonlight
here
and
the
roses
have
made
the
softest
carpet
out
of
sweet
you
know
and
the
pansies
cushions
of
purple
velvet
they
all
love
their
little
queen
so
and
the
butterfly
fairies
will
be
there
too
in
their
lovely
velvet
clothes
with
their
beautiful
wings
of
orange
and
black
and
yellow
and
purple
and
rose
and
oh
there
are
ever
so
many
more
i
can
hardly
remember
them
all
who
coming
just
think
of
it
dear
to
dance
at
the
fairies
ball
so
hurry
up
quick
and
close
your
eyes
for
i
heard
the
roses
say
that
to
see
the
fairies
one
must
always
come
around
by
dreamland
way
the
little
sleepy
song
there
someone
singing
a
little
song
out
in
the
garden
a
queer
little
sleepy
sleepy
song
out
there
in
the
soft
moonlight
and
the
little
song
goes
zactly
like
this
ah
ziz
z
z
zis
and
i
wonder
who
it
is
that
singing
that
little
song
of
ziz
zis
there
a
queer
little
frog
in
the
pond
out
there
i
wonder
if
it
is
he
and
is
he
singing
himself
to
sleep
or
is
he
singing
to
me
little
sunset
ship
of
dreams
there
a
little
ship
sails
out
to
sea
at
each
day
with
a
little
crew
all
sound
asleep
and
it
bound
for
dreamland
bay
across
the
silver
waves
it
goes
softly
as
a
dream
far
out
to
sea
in
the
misty
light
of
the
evening
star
agleam
oh
little
ship
of
baby
dreams
far
out
on
the
sapphire
sea
may
the
dear
white
angels
softly
watch
thy
little
crew
and
thee
