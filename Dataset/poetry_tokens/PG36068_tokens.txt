canadian
provinces
they
lay
divided
by
river
and
by
bay
many
a
separate
division
among
them
there
was
no
cohesion
but
statesmen
saw
that
a
great
nation
could
be
formed
by
federation
and
soon
they
led
public
opinion
to
favor
forming
this
dominion
with
its
streams
and
fountains
with
sources
in
the
rocky
mountains
it
was
all
a
great
mystery
hunting
for
furs
its
history
though
is
filling
slow
yet
soon
there
will
be
mighty

few
lands
can
with
it

often
try

all
in

that
ere

will
behold
many
a

niagara
dry
it
happened
once
in
early
spring
while
there
did
float
great
thick
ice
cakes
that
then
a
gale
did
quickly
bring
them
all
down
from
the
upper
lakes
and
from
buffalo
to
lake
erie
across
the
entrance
to
river
it
was
a
scene
of
icebergs
dreary
those
who
saw
will
remember
ever
then
gale
blew
up
lake
and
river
and
left
niagara
almost
dry
this
a
lady
did
discover
as
above
the
falls
she
cast
her
eye
such
scene
it
had
been
witnessed
never
since
israelites
crossed
the
red
sea
when
they
had
resolved
forever
from
pharaoh
bondage
to
flee
lady
she
resolved
to
venture
proudly
carrying
british
flag
erecting
it
in
river
centre
in
crevice
of
a
rocky
crag
it
seems
like
a
romance
by
bulwer
how
she
captured
niagara
but
it
was
seen
by
bishop
fuller
who
did
at
sight
of
flag
hurrah
ten
thousand
years
may
die
away
before
another
dry
can
tread
in
bottom
of
niagara
for
she
doth
jealous
guard
her
bed
but
ice
her
entrance
did
blockade
and
wind
it
kept
the
waters
back
so
that
a
child
could
almost
wade
across
the
brink
of
cataract
united
by
steel
rails
when
indian
tribes
in
the
northwest
rebelled
against
the
eastern
laws
canadian
courage
it
did
test
all
were
united
in
the
cause
but
how
shall
volunteers
proceed
such
distance
several
thousand
miles
will
they
in
their
dark
hour
of
need
ask
uncle
sam
with
pleasant
smiles
for
to
allow
our
volunteers
to
pass
their
north
railroad
perhaps
subject
to
doubts
and
fears
where
british
soldiers
never
trod
but
there
went
up
a
glad
hurrah
when
it
was
found
that
in
our
land
almost
finished
was
railway
and
trains
do
wait
for
word
command
to
bear
away
our
volunteers
to
those
far
north
distant
lands
but
dispelled
were
all
their
fears
when
they
rode
over
those
steel
bands
which
bound
young
nation
all
in
one
before
detached
and
all
apart
shoulder
to
shoulder
now
each
one
feels
patriot
feelings
in

first
time
we
truly
realize
the
value
of
this
great
railway
its
benefits
each
now
doth
prize

japan
and
australia
the
policy
it
has
proved
wise
which
did

here
the

not
afraid
to

he
gets
a

but
in
its
place
doth
justly
prize
his
tea
and
cakes
and
pumpkin
pies
when
winter
comes
it
brings
no
gloom
but
makes
fresh
pleasures
spring
and
bloom
for
when
the
youth
longs
for
a
bride
he
gives
his
girl
a
grand
sleigh
ride
which
to
them
both
doth
pleasures
bring

do

he
is
happy

his
chosen

warm
love

never

young
folks
oft
they
do
take
pride
how
swift
they
down

can
glide

they
bravely
dare

they
may
enjoy
the

sir
john
the
greatest
power
doth
wield
our
canadian
beaconsfield
the
old
snake
fence
in
early
times
the
pioneer
when
a
few
acres
he
did
clear
he
found
ample
recompense
for
splitting
rails
and
making
fence
though
it
was
crooked
as
a
snake
and
zigzag
style
did
not
awake
he
thought
it
was
a
thing
of
beauty
yet
in
its
day
it
did
its
duty
and
though
the
old
snake
fence
must
fall
was
easy
made
axe
wedge
and
maul
were
all
the
tools
the
pioneer
required
the
old
rail
fence
to
rear
and
the
old
pioneer
could
boast
of
fence
that
did
not
need
a
post
to
build
it
now
is
waste
of
timber
and
fertile
lands
it
doth
cumber
and
pine

with
its
sharp
roots
will
long
endure
and
ward
off

for
the

they
ample
shield
and
do
protect
each
separate

but
old
style
fence
doth
waste
much
land
where
weeds
do
grow

doth
blow

on

skilfully

while

they
all
hoped

to
see
the
glorious

from
their
memories
they
never
forgot
the
land
of
lake
and

while
up
the

they
do
advance
they
dream
about
their
own

oft

clearing
the
first

which
i
did
spend
in
canada
was
with
a

and
when
the
snow
had
passed
away
quite
early
in
the
month
of
may
friend
started
off
for
a
barn
raising
and
told
me
to
get
stumps
ablazing
around
each
stump
i
heaped
a
pile
of
roots
and
junks
of
wood
so
vile
for
he
wished
the
field
to
clear
so
it
a
crop
of
wheat
would
rear
and
there
was
one
high
withered
pine
which
was
full
of
turpentine
as
soon
as
i
applied
the
torch
blaze
quick
did
start
and
it
did
scorch
the
fences
and
the
woods
were
nigh
for
the
old
tree
it
blazed
on
high
i
was
the
only
man
or
boy
near
there
that
day
and
found
employ
in
saving
of
the
house

thus
early
fire
fiend
did
me
warn
fire
started
and
with
it
a
breeze
carried
the
sparks
leaves
of
trees
i
did
work
hard
but
for
recompense
all
was
saved
but
a
few

social
april
our
first
canadian
job
when
boy
in
the
big
woods
we
did
enjoy
large
maple
bush
we
then
did
tap
and
to
camp
carried
maple
sap
we
stored
it
in
great
wooden
trough
then
in
big
kettles
sugared
off
though
often
it
did
try
our
mettle
to
keep
up
fire
beneath
each
kettle
for
it
was
a
serious
toil
to
cut
the
wood
to
kettles
boil
it
is
a
pleasant
joke
no
trouble
from
the
fire
and
smoke
of
old
we
thought
our
neck
was
broke
by
having
on
it
a
neckyoke
and
on
each
side
a
heavy
pail
suspended
from
the
yoke
by
bail
we
waded
through
the
snow
and
slush
and
stumbled
the
logs
in
bush
but
no
doubt
the
maple
sweeter
than
any
other
thing
in
meter
unless
it
is
the
lips
of
lass
which
maple
sugar
doth
surpass
and
may
it
be
each
young

fate
for
to
secure
a
charming

for

will
soon
begin
to
sing

an
english
youth
to

came
a
labourer
john

by
name
his
little
wealth
had
made
him
bold
twenty
sovereigns
in
gold
he
was
industrious
and
wise
and
small
sums
did
not
despise
he
added
to
his
wealth
each
year
for
independence
he
loved
dear
he
knew
a
laborer
he
would
be
forever
in
the
old
country
his
forefathers
had
tilled
the
ground
and
never
one
had
saved
a
pound
on
beds
of
down
they
did
not
lie
and
frugally
their
goods
did
buy
their
one
luxury
around
their
door
a
few
choice
flowers
their
garden
bore
but
never
hoped
to
own
the
soil
but
serve
as
hinds
to
sweat
and
toil
to
work
and
toil
for
him
had
charm
he
hoped
some
day
to
own
a
farm
so
he
hired
with
reuben
tripp
the
wealthiest
man
in
the
township

till
rich
enough
to
buy

for
to
chop
down
with
his
strong
arm
the
truest
nobleman
of
all
he
lives
not
in

but
sheltereth
family
from
harm
by
logs
rolled
up
by
his
strong
arm
in
this
young
glorious
land
so
free
where
each
may
rear
his

and
the
chief
glory
of
old
days
broad
fire
place
where
big
logs
did
blaze
as
much
as
four
strong
men
could
handle
they
served
alike
for
heat
and
candle
he
his
young
oxen
did
adorn
with
fine
gay
ribbons
on
each
horn
and
to
his
home
with
joy
and
pride
he
did
bring
sweet
blooming
bride
such
happiness
is
seldom
seen
happier
far
than
king
or
queen
she
helped
him
in
the
fields
to
reap
and
spun
the
wool
from
off
the
sheep
all
they
required

had

and
she
was
a
good
tailoress

made
was
of
the
very
finest
grade

blessed
and
though
they
did
not
have
stove
then
neither
did
they
own
an
oven
she
filled
large
pot
with
well
knead
dough
and
baked
fine
bread
embers
glow
he
each
winter
the
forest
trees
did
quickly
hew
them
down
with
ease
for
he
to
work
had
a
desire
and
the
skill
did
soon
acquire
but
round
great
giants
hewed
a
ring
then
storms
would
soon
them
prostrate
bring
for
many
a
time
the
furious
breeze
would
quick
the
girdled
trees
and
sometimes
they
would
kill
the
cows
when
they
did
feed
on
grass
or
browse
but
after
reckoning
damage
all
a
benefit
was
each
windfall
though
good
fortune
now
he
sees
might
have
been
got
from
walnut
trees
but
trees
were
foes
in
his
hurry
all
were
slain
both
oak
and
cherry
and
to
this
day
he
doth
incline
to
mourn
slaughter
of
the
pine
and
reflects
how
he
did
many
a
maple
beech
and
elm
and
each
summer
day
did
toil
with
his
steers
drawing
logs
in
pile
these
giants
of
the
forest
dead
fire
did
reduce
to
an
ash
bed
and
soon
potatoes
wheat
and
corn
they
did
the
rugged
stumps
adorn
and
jane
did
help
him
with
the
hoe
and
well
she
did
keep
her
row
no
organs
then
they
had
to
play
but
she
could
work
and
sing
all
day
in
spring
he
did
live
maples
tap
to
draw
from
them
the
luscious
sap
he
gathered
it
in
big
log
trough
then
boiled
it
down
and
sugared
off
enough
the
household
for
to
cheer
with
all
its
sweets
for
the
whole
year
and
no
such
thing
those
times
were
seen
as
the
swift
raising
stump
machine
and
where
main
road
was
low
and
damp
with
logs
he
built
a
road
through
swamp
but
a
smooth
ride
could
not
enjoy
while
it
was
naught
but
corduroy
each
year
added
earth
and
gravel
now
smoothly
they
can
travel
for
it
doth
make
an
excellent
road
for
john
and
jane
to
go
abroad
and
it
is
now
a
great
highway
where
hundreds
travel
every
day
there
were
no
roads
in
early
days
but
bridle
path
their
guide
the
blaze
and
mills
and
marts
so
far
away
they
never
could
return
same
day
log
school
house
served
as
church
for
all
of
various
creeds
and
for
town
hall
these
scenes
to
youth
do
now
seem
strange
so
wondrous
quick
hath
been
the
change
paths
where
oxen
only
trod
cows
quickly
speed
the
railroad
and
every
way
both
up
and
down
there
has
sprung
up
a
thriving
town
no
more
he
fights
with
forest
trees
but
both
enjoy
their
wealth
and
ease
long
since
the
old
folks
both
are
gone
and
left
the
whole
to
jane
and
john
the
log
house
now
has
passed
away
with
all
its
chinks
filled
in
with
clay
and
in
its
place
fine
house
of
stone
with
lawn
where
choice
shrubs
are
grown
with
sons
and
daughters
they
are
blest
the
young
men
say
they
move
northwest
this
gives
their
mother
some
alarm
she
wants
them
still
on
the
home
farm
but
father
will
not
have
them
tarry
they
can
plow
so
quick
on
prairie
and
they
find
coal
makes
a
good
fire
and
build
their
fences
of
barbed
wire
they
would
not
be
forever
gone
as
they
could
talk
by
telephone
we
have
been
congratulated
by
many
on
the
truthfulness
of
the
romance
of
canada
they
declare
it
is
not
a
romance
but
a
true
picture
of
rise
and
progress
of
worthy
people
in
canada
lament
of
the
maple
tree
a
vision
we
had
a
dream
which
was
not
all
a
byron
i
laid
me
down
one
day
in
june
it
was
late
long
afternoon
a
very
sultry
summer
eve
such
times
the
senses
oft
deceive
the
place
was
a
maple
tree
soon
from
all
cares
and
troubles
free
by
a
gentle
kindly
slumber
no
more
our
sorrows
we
could
number
but
we
heard
a
plaintive
wail
such
as
we
find
in
fairy
tale
it
was
the
genius
of
the
tree
who
in
sad
guise
appeared
to
me
and
then
she
sadly
did
give
vent
unto
this
awful
grave
lament
though
i
am
gay
in
month
of
june
all
decked
in
green
yet
very
soon
alas
my
beauty
will
be
faded
and
my
charms
be
all
degraded
for
is
my
time
of
glory
brief
so
often
flattered
is
my
leaf
in
canada
so
broad
and
free
all
poets
sing
of
the
maple
tree
high
i
stand
in
their
opinion
emblem
of
the
new
dominion
the
reason
i
do
them
upbraid
some
never
slept
beneath
my
shade
and
yet
they
take
the
liberty
to
chant
about
the
maple
tree
they
dare
to
poetise
my
leaf
this
is
the
source
of
all
my
grief
i
think
their
praises
all
so
rude
and
as
but
base
ingratitude
so
often
hackneyed
is
my
name
that
every
fall
i
burn
with
shame
like
maiden
cheek
which
blushes
red
when
vain
rash
youth
asks
her
to
wed
then
do
these
foolish
ones
descry
in
me
fresh
beauty
and
they
sigh
and
then
renew
their
songs
of
praise
but
unto
me
how
sad
their
lays
for
then
i
know
my
days
are
brief
is
hectic
flush
upon
my
leaf
true
poets
then
should
mournful
sing
when
the
destroyer
on
the
wing
for
then
i
know
my
leaves
of
gold
will
all
soon
mingle
with
the
mould
no
one
does
ever
think
to
praise
the
fell
destroyer
when
he
slays
none
rejoice
in
the
flushed
cheek
when
the
poor
girl
is
low
and
weak
perhaps
they
say
and
it
is
true
in
spring
my
glories
i
renew
but
is
poor
comfort
after
all
to
lose
my
offspring
every
fall
small
consolation
to
mother
to
tell
her
that
soon
another
will
replace
her
fond
darling
boy
who
has
been
source
of
all
her
joy
but
you
know
all
about
my
wood
you
know
that
it
is
strong
and
good
and
i
have
full
many
a
curl
and
pleasing
eye
and
charming
nurl
some
love
me
as
fond
nature
grained
and
some
prefer
my
beauty
stained
but
my
dear
friend
i
hope
that
you
my
varied
shades
love
pure
and
true
for
of
the
woods
you
know
the
staple
stoutest
and
best
is
good
maple
the
youth
my
sugar
eat
with
glee
and
old
maids
love
me
in
their
tea
in
me
do
various
uses
meet
in
summer
shade
in
winter
heat
for
i
do
make
a
glorious
blaze
all
worthy
of
the
poet
lays
but
to
their
praises
i
be
deaf
if
more
they
harp
about
my
leaf
they
call
me
gay
when
i
am
sober
to
me
is
gloomy
month
october
but
saints
on
earth
when
they
die
hope
for
true
bliss
beyond
the
sky
so
winter
does
bring
no
alarms
though
it
strip
bare
my
trunk
and
arms
for
now
i
know
that
time
will
bring
more
glorious
foliage
in
the
spring
then
all
nature
will
rejoice
triumphing
with
glorious
voice
and
birds
will
in
my
branches
sing
hosannas
to
the
lovely
spring
the
nurls
and
birds
eyes
and
curls
were
highly
prized
in
furniture
thirty
years
ago
when
we
used
the
smooth
plain
life
in
the
woods
life
of
the
early
settlers
canada
hath
wealthy
yeomen
whose
fathers
overcome
the
foemen
the
enemy
they
boldly
slew
was
mighty
forests
they
did
hew
and
where
they
burned
heaps
of
slain
their
sons
now
reap
the
golden
grain
but
in
the
region
of
northwest
with
prairie
farms
they
are
blest
though
this
to
them
it
may
seem
good
yet
many
blessings
come
from
wood
it
shelters
you
from
the
fierce
storm
and
in
the
winter
keeps
you
warm
for
one
who
hath
his
forest
trees
he
builds
his
house
and
barn
with
ease
and
how
quick
he
gets
from
thence
timber
for
bridge
and
for
his
fence
the
joys
of
prairie
farmers
we
let
ontario
farmers
sing
about
the
joys
the
woods
do
bring
but
we
in
regions
of
northwest
do
think
prairie
farms
the
best
for
those
poor
men
who
swing
the
axe
on
their
strength
is
a
heavy
tax
for
several
years
they
naught
can
grow
while
from
the
first
we
plow
and
sow
and
while
we
plow
we
do
get
thumps
by
running
it
against
the
stumps
and
where
wild
buffalo
now
doth
feed
there
very
soon
they
sow
the
seed
where
indian
wigwams
now
do
stand
will
be
the
site
of
cities
grand
and
where
the
deer
and
wolf
doth
roam
millions
will
build
each
happy
home
so
quick
as
if
by
magic
wand
they
will
arise
the
whole
land
but
this
one
fact
we
wo
deny
ontario
she
can
supply
for
so
skilfully
she
doth
invent
each
agricultural
implement
canada
our
home
the
following
response
to
canada
our
home
was
given
at
a
banquet
of
the
caledonian
society
ingersoll
in
responding
to
the
sentiment
canada
our
home
perhaps
it
would
be
appropriate
to
point
out
the
prominent
and
distinguishing
characteristics
between
the
land
of
our
nativity
and
the
land
of
our
adoption
in
this
canada
of
ours
we
have
no
bonny
blooming
heath
no
banks
and
braes
covered
with
daisies
and
gowans
no
fragrant
hedges
showering
down
white
spray
in
the
may
time
no
whin
and
broom
prodigal
in
their
gaiety
of
yellow
flowers
no
hills
nor
glens
where
fairies
gambol
in
pleasant
and
harmless
sport
no
grand
ruins
of
ancient
cathedrals
and
castles
no
feathered
songsters
like
the
mavis
and
blackbird
full
oft
we
did
enraptured
hark
to
heavenly
song
of
the
skylark
but
canada
is
a
young
giant
in
its
infancy
with
the
noblest
chain
of
lakes
in
the
world
on
its
frontier
and
the
most
magnificent
river
the
lawrence
this
land
also
possesses
the
largest
fertile
wilderness
on
the
globe
but
it
is
one
which
will
ere
many
years
have
passed
away
blossom
like
a
garden
and
where
naught
but
grass
and
flowers
now
grow
in
wild
luxuriance
soon
the
husbandman
will
plow
and
sow
and
reap
a
rich
reward
in
yellow
golden
grain
domestic
cattle
quiet
will
graze
where
now
the
buffalos
roam
and
in
spots
now
covered
with
indian
wigwams
where
white
men
never
trod
cities
will
occupy
their
sites
with
busy
trade
and
millions
flock
from
eastern
lands
to
take
possession
of
the
great
northwest
then
winnipeg
perchance
may
be
the
capital
of
the
dominion
in
the
day
foretold
when
this
indeed
shall
be
the
greater
britain
with
ontario
towns
for
workshops
for
this
vast
prairie
land
then
poets
will
arise
and
high
their
lays
will
soar
worthy
of
the
muse
of
a
burns
or
a
moore
a
shakespeare
and
a
milton
the
great
and
the
wise
will
sing
of
the
glories
of
our
northern
skies
of
its
lakes
and
rivers
and
its
mountains
grand
of
its
fertile
plains
and
great
prairie
land
a
fit
theme
for
song

empire
gigantic
whose

from

to

violets
once
while
digging
the
snow
canadian
winter
lo
to
our
joy
and
surprise
we
saw
some
violets
in
full
bloom
gazing
at
us
with
loving
eyes
thanking
us
for
opening
their
tomb
yet
still
they
seemed
so
cozy
and
nice
enshrined
in
the
crystal

while
all
else
were
drooping

is
not

for
we
have
bounteous
crops
of

and
you
behold
on

after
all
the

young
donald

among

the

rills
in
a
snug
little
cot
content
with
his
lot
he
never
knew
sorrow
with
his
wife
and
wee
flora
but
an
order
went
forth
the
land
of
the
north
to
burn
many
a
home
so
the
wild
deer
might
roam
with
grief
he
then
did
toss
every
night
donald

sad
seemed
the
morrow
for
his

it
was
a
cruel
deed
but
nobles
do
not
heed
the
sorrows
of

moor
where
he
wove
a
wreath
of
the
blooming
heath
for
to
crown
with
glory
the
brow
of
little

he
then
bade
farewell

lived
a
thousand

with

canadian
authors
moody
in
giving
a
glance
at
various
canadian
authors
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
commence
with
that
early
writer
moody
she
was
a
sister
of
the
celebrated
agnes
strickland
author
of
the
queens
of
england
when
this
country
it
was
woody
its
great
champion
moody
showed
she
had
both
pluck
and
push
in
her
work
roughing
in
the
bush
for
there
alone
she
did
dwell
at
time
mckenzie
did
rebel
outbreak
her
husband
strove
to
quell
her
own
grand
struggles
she
doth
tell
round
bush
life
she
threw
a
glory

renowned
in
story
but
her
tale
it
is
more
cheering
when
she
wrote
about
the
clearing

other

c
though
she
doth
not
fail
she
now
is

i
sent
her
a
copy
of
my

in
and
she
thanked
me
for
the
same
through
a
friend
as
she
was
in
feeble
health
at
the
time
mcgee
having
been
kindly
invited
as
a
member
of
the
mechanics
institute
some
years
ago
by
the
late
jeremiah
to
meet
that
gentleman
in
company
with
a
number
of
our
townsmen
when
mcgee
was
rising
from
the
table
the
chair
being
new
stuck
to
him
and
it
being
near
a
general
election
he
very
wittily
remarked
that
he
hoped
the
people
of
montreal
would
be
as
anxious
to
retain
him
in
his
seat
as
the
people
here
are
we
wrote
the
following
lines
at
the
time
the
last
verse
was
added

d
arcy

all
compliment
thee
the
hope
of

on
your
lecture
so
grand
though
that
is
your
forte
oh
give
us
the
sport
of
an
hour
of
your
chat
then
we
laugh
and
grow
fat
for
none
but
the
vile
could
cease
to
smile
when
near
to
thee
so
brilliant
and
free
plant
of

long
in

you
take

there
flourished
in
canada
three
scottish
editors
all
of
whom
were
poets
mcqueen
of
the
huron
signal
goderich
who
wrote
a
grand
song
on
our
broad
lake
and
mcgeorge
of
the
streetsville
review
the
following
lines
are
on
george
menzies
who
was
a
woodstock
editor
one
day
while
passing
the
road
on
a
small
book
we
almost
trod
its
leaves
were
scattered
the
ground
we
picked
them
up
and
when
we
found
the
author
name
it
did
inspire
us
with
a
very
strong
desire
to
read
the
little
volume
through
for
most
of
it
to
us
was
new
he
doth
sing
of
land
of
heather
and
canadian
scenes
together
he
did
adore
niagara
roar
where
mighty
flood
fall
doth
pour
but
poets
lives
are
often
brief
and
he
had
his
full
share
of
grief
which
to
his
life
did
gloom
impart
but
he
bore
up
with
his
brave
heart
lines
sent
to
thomas
conant
of
oshawa
a
writer
of
canadian
sketches
we
do
greet
thee
thomas
conant
you
truthful
paint
canadian
charms
and
you
are
the
great
exponent
of
beauties
of
her
woods
and
farms
you
give
fine
sketch
of
bird
and
fowl
of
the
blue
jay
and
the
plover
and
of
great
white
canadian
owl
all

of

robert
fleming
gourley
robert
gourley
was
a
graduate
of
andrew
university
scotland
he
was
the
first
to
agitate
for
popular
rights
in
canada
he
was
banished
from
the
country
and
while
crossing
the
niagara
river
he
asked
for
a
brush
to
wipe
canadian
dust
from
his
feet
he
became
a
champion
of
popular
rights
in
england
and
he
whipped
lord
brougham
in
the
lobby
of
the
house
of
commons
for
which
breach
of
privilege
he
was
sentenced
by
the
house
gourley
owned
several
farms
in
oxford
ontario
and
sought
to
represent
south
oxford
in
but
connor
an
uncle
of
hon
blake
won
the
seat
blake
was
his
uncle
secretary
through
the
contest
when
he
was
a
youth
there
came
to
oxford
robert
gourley
in
his
old
age
his
health
was
poorly
he
was
a
relic
of
the
past
in
his
dotage
sinking
fast
yet
he
was
erect
and
tall
like
noble
ruined
castle
wall
in
early
times
they
did
him
impeach
for
demanding
right
of
speech
now
oxford
he
wished
to
represent
in
canadian
parliament
but
him
the
riding
did
not
honor
but
elected
doctor
connor
lines
sent
to
alexander
mclaughlan
amaranth
station
with
a
copy
of
my
poems
we
send
to
you
these
rugged
rhymes
in
memory
of
the
olden
times
great
chief
of
our
poetic
clan
admired
by
all
mclaughlan
prologue
to
south
ontario
sketches
the
district
lying
south
of
georgian
bay
and
lake
simcoe
including
toronto
my
friends
we
sing
canadian
themes
for
in
them
we
proudly
glory
her
lakes
and
rivers
and
her
streams
worthy
of
renown
in
story
and
in
these
leaves
we
hope
is
strewn
some
wheat
among
the
chaff
and
maple
boughs
by
rude
axe
hewn
where
one
may
find
a
rustic
staff
to
help
him
the
rugged
lines
if
he
to
weariness
inclines
some
see
no
beauties
near
to
home
but
do
admire
the
distant
far
they
always
love
abroad
to
roam
view
glory
in
but
far
off
star
but
let
it
never
be
forgot
that
distant
hills
when
closer
seen
are
after
all
a
barren
spot
not
like
your
own
hills
clad
in
green
you
find
they
are
but
idle
dreams
to
seek
for
happiness
afar
at
home
there
lovely
lakes
and
streams
remain
content
now
where
you
are
at
us
we
hope
you
will
not
rage
because
we
sing
of
local
charms
in
each
varied
town
and
village
as
well
as
round
our
local
farms
but
our
address
it
must
be
brief
so
now
we
bid
you
all
adieu
but
of
our
book
pray
read
each
leaf
until
the
whole
you
have
gone
through
each
one
doth
know
it
is
not
wise
though
our
songs
may
not
be
vocal
chants
of
our
home
for
to
despise
but
prize
them
they
are
local
holland
river
and
its
tributaries
meanderings
of
a
stream
rises
twenty
miles
north
of
toronto
and
sweeps
around
the
whole
of
southern
ontario
we
love
to
sing
of
tiny
stream
through
the
lowland
meadows
running
to
us
it
is
a
pleasing
theme
tracing
it
from
first
beginning
is
strange
how
far
a
brook
will
roam
moving
onwards
in
its
motion
and
not
content
till
it
reaches
home
two
thousand
miles
to
distant
ocean
in
county
york
springs
a
small
brook
a
few
miles
north
of
ontario
but
it
doth
take
a
wondrous
crook
it
northward
many
miles
doth
flow
brook
progress
south
is
stopped
by
ridge
doth
debar
its
southern
course
so
a
long
journey
it
do
grudge
but
slowly
on
its
way
doth
force
and
it
discharges
at
its
mouth
into
the
pure
clear
lake
simcoe
it
still
flows
north
for
to
get
south
as
onward
still
its
course
doth
go
rejoicing
along
its
way
hundreds
of
miles
it
doth
flow
west
blended
in
the
georgian
bay
for
a
moment
it
doth
not
rest
mingling
with
huron
and
clair
erie
and
niagara
river
even
at
the
falls
it
do
despair
but
it
cheerful
flows
forever
one
thousand
miles
round
an
ox
bow
it
hath
flowed
back
near
its
first
start
to
waters
of
ontario
where

kept
it
apart
from
south
of
ridge
two
rivers
flow
both
the
don
and
the
humber
embracing
city
of

hath
attractions
without
number
the
fame
will
spread
far
and
wide
first
of

and
then
of

brantford
in
these
sketches
of
towns
in
southern
ontario
we
are
not
vain
enough
to
suppose
that
because
we
have
produced
some
lines
thereon
that
said
rhymes
are
poetry
if
we
furnish
an
occasional
poetic
gleam
like
a
dewdrop
sparkling
in
the
sun
it
is
all
we
dare
hope
for
brantford
as
thriving
city
famed
and
after
indian
chief
is
named
and
here
the
sparkling
grand
river
it
doth
flow
a
joy
forever
campbell
he
sang
a
dismal
tale
of
horrors
of
wyoming
vale
the
tale
one
mind
doth
ever
haunt
the
cruelties
of
monster
brant
but
the
chief
son
to
england
went
and
campbell
to
him
did
lament
and
all
the
tale
he
did
recant
about
cruel
butcheries
of
brant
now
pleasant
thoughts
it
doth
awake
when
brantford
thinks
of
her
namesake
she
evermore
with
pride
will
chant
the
bold
heroic
name
of
brant
we
sing
of
two
great
indian
names
tecumseh
on
the
banks
of
thames
and
the
grand
river
it
doth
vaunt
the
historic
name
of
brant
the
city
pride
it
doth
find
vent
in
building
him
a
monument
and
indians
will
proudly
stalk

mccready
the
great
irish
tragedian
said
that
the
view
from
thorold
was
the
finest
in
america
thorold
is
famous
for
its
mills
and
the
grand
view
from
off
its
hills
a
view
so
charming
and
extended
nature
beauties
sweetly
blended
poetic
thoughts
it
doth
awake
to
view
ontario

have
their

where
choice

do
grow
the
landscape
all
within

reach
doth
both
produce

mccready
said
in
the
new

the
finest
view
was
from
thorold
you
see
catharines
thriving

and
steamers
sailing
up

down
and
you
can
see

you
clearly
see
the
haze
where
niagara
doth
amaze
and
glance

no

have

lined
with
brick

like
your
broadway
port
stanley
in
winter
time
is
sad
and
dreary
for
to
gaze
on
stormy
erie
but
here
in
summer
time
this
port
it
is
a
fashionable
resort
for
then
it
is
always
cheery
for
to
gaze
upon
lake
erie
or
on
the
steamer
you
can
sail
all
independent
of
the

or
here
the
youth
can
ply
the
oar
and
view
the
fast
receding
shore
and
be
happy
with
his
dearie
on
the
bosom
of

no
one
here
need
ever
weary
on
the
borders
of

with

parties
at

all
so
manly
or

the
following
lines
were

at
a
concert
when
port
burwell
was
a
busy
port
and
there
had
been
a
race
on
the
ice
the
day
before
in
winter
time
who
here
resort
to
pay
a
visit
to
your
busy
port
they
must
be
clad
in
fur
well
for
it
blows
cold
at
burwell
but
when
you
wish
to
trot
your
horse
you
make

your

course
and
we
believe
at
every
heat
all

you
do

no

about
the

of

canada
was
a

importer
of

cheese
is
the
principal

export

ranney
was
doing

thriving
business
in

line
manufacturing
cheese
after

century
was
half
gone
on

plan
from

of

decade
later

introduced

both
of

have
departed

in

fed

the

has
been
removed
to
thamesford
when
father
ranney
left
the
states
in
canada
to
try
the
fates
he
settled
down
in
dereham
then
no
dairyman
lived
near
him
he
was
the
first
there
to
squeeze
his
cows
milk
into
good
cheese
and
at
each
provincial
show
his
famed
cheese
was
all
the
go
then
long
life
to
father
ranney
may
he
wealth
and
honour
gain
aye
he
always
took
the
first
prize
both
for
quality
and
size
but
many
of
his
neighbors
now
profit
by
his
labors
and
the
ladies
dress
in
silk
from
the
proceeds
of
the
milk
but
those
who
buy
their
butter
how
dear
it
is
they
mutter
then
long
life
to
father
ranney
may
he
his
health
retain
aye
the
farmers
can
not
be
beat
they
have
both
cheese
and
their
wheat
though
now
their
greatest
care
is
for
to
watch
their
dairies
they
carefully
fill
their
mows
with
provender
for
their
cows
and
they
thus
enrich
the
soil
with
much
profit
for
their
toil
we
will
sing
this
refrain
aye
long
life
to
father
ranney
the
motto
union
is
strength
is
carried
out
at
length
in
the
most
compact
array
at
every
cheese
factory
you
see
without
going
far
as
there
is
one
kept
by
harris
the
factory
of
ingersoll
just
out
at
the
first
toll
may
he
never
suffer
pain
aye
the
father
of
cheesemen
ranney
or
you
may
go
all
the
way
to
see
one
kept
by
galloway
and
out
in
the
norwiches
dairymen
are
making
riches
and
honor
has
been
won
by
harvey
farrington
the
same
path
is
trodden
by
folks
about
culloden
may
his
strength
never
wane
aye
the
great
dairyman
ranney
and
of
late
we
saw
some
very
good
cheese
from
lawson
all
around
mt
elgin
dairymen
have
well
done
and
out
in
east
nissouri
they
make
some
scores
a
day
from
jarvis
and
elliott
some
good
cheese
are
bought
and
we
will
all
remain
aye
indebted
to
father
ranney
now
we
close
this
glorious
theme
this
song
of
curds
and
rich
cream
you
can
buy
your
hoops
and
screws
and
all
supplies
for
dairy
use
milk
cans
and
vats
all
things
like
these
in
ingersoll
great
mart
for

here
buyers
all
do
congregate
and
pay
for

the
highest
rate
so
we
call
on
you
again
aye
to
honor
father
ranney
ode
on
the
mammoth
cheese
weight
over

may
you
not
receive

you
off

beware
of
these
for
some

we
could
not

suspended

ode

did

that
canada
was

of

they
imagined
it
could
flow
in
this
cold
land
of
ice
and

where
everything
did
solid
freeze
they
hoped
or
looked
for
cheese

our
oxford
farms
were
nearly
robbed
of
all
their
charms
cropped
the
weary
land
grew
poor
and
nearly
barren
as
a
moor

now
their
owners
live
at

rejoicing
in
their
crop
of

and
since
they
justly
treat
the
soil
are
well
rewarded
for
their

the
land
enriched
by
goodly
cows
yields
plenty
now
to
fill
their
mows
both
wheat
and
barley
oats
and
peas
but
still
their
greatest
boast
is
cheese
and
you
must
careful
fill
your
mows
with
good
provender
for
your
cows
and
in
the
winter
keep
them
warm
protect
them
safe
all

do
dearly
love
their

of

made
early
in

when

give

fodder
you
can
not
make

the
quality
is
often
vile
of

that
is
made
in

therefore
we
think
for
that
reason
you
should
make
later
in
the
season
cheese
making
now
you
should
delay
until
about
the
first
of
may

do
feed

that

where
dairy
farmers
do
make

cheese

can
compete
and
daily
polish
up

pans
take

with

it

the

when

they
take

this

is
true
we
pledge
our

they
baited
hook
with
a
piece
of

and
let
the
rod
hang
from
the

while

on

did
float
and
then
they
start
for

with

they
raised

it

sometimes
a

it

with

doth

you
can
not

then
at

you
should

on

market
we

our

you
do

doth
shrink

if
you

you
can

remember
too
that
of
your

the

will
fondly
eat
sell

then
invest
and
you
can
get

the

remarks
apply

it

when
invited

we

with

for
to

the

of

we
saw

culutre
fame
to
this
tale
he
lends
his

a
pair
of
eagles
built
their
nest
on
a
lofty
pine
tree
crest
and
therein
they
regular
rear
a
brood
of
young
year
after
year
one
day
he
saw
one
leave
its
nest
when
for
food
it
was
in
quest
it
did
wing
its
flight
on
high
and
then
on
water
cast
its
eye
when
it
quickly
did
discover
a
great
salmon
in
the
river
like
lightning
flash
down
it
doth
sweep
and
its
talons
it
buries
deep
in
salmon
of
enormous
size
he
trys
to
rise
in
air
with
prize
but
all
in
vain
he
quickly
found
he
could
not
carry
thirty
pound
and
had
bit
more
than
he
could
chew
for
in
the
air
no
more
he
flew
wilmot
he
did
gaze
with
wonder
at
the
spot
where
he
went
under
resolved
to
know
what
was
the
matter
he
poled
his
boat
the
water
and
he
looked
down
and
there
he
found
that
the
eagle
it
was
drowned
and
its
wings
in
part
outspread
but
alas
it
was
quite
dead
with
grappling
hook
he
drew
him
out
but
attached
to
him
was
monster
trout
eagle
could
not
extract
his
claws
and
this
the
death
of
both
did
cause
captain
adventure
three
years
ago
my
vessel
lay
in
a
port
of
hudson
bay
i
started
off
for
the
trading
post
but
on
the
way
back
i
then
got
lost
and
the
thought
soon
gave
me
the
blues
trudging
along
on
my
snow
shoes
over
the
wastes
of
drifting
snow
while
the
wind
it
did
fiercely
blow
i
feared
that
i
would
be
froze
hard
for
it
was
a
fearful
blizzard
i
was
growing
faint
and
weary
not
the
slightest
hopes
to
cheer
me
without
compass
to
bearing
my
yells
were
beyond
crews
hearing
but
at
last
to
my
loud
halloo
there
came
a
mournful
ho
ho
from
creature
white
i
thought
was
ghost
and
that
i
was
forever
lost
i
heard
horrid
creature
flutter
as
it
those
strange
sounds
did
utter
at
last
i
found
that
all
this
howl
was
from
a
noble
large
white
owl
and
a
happy
apparition
so
runs
the
indian
tradition
it
guides
the
lost
one
in
distress
and
leads
him
out
of
wilderness
this
strange
bird
i
soon
follow
and
it
still
kept
up
its
halloo
it
seem
that
it
cried
to
cheer
me
i
thought
the
ship
was
now
near
me
as
i
walked
the
banks
of
snow
i
kept
up
a
feeble
halloo
and
but
a
little
ways
beyond
from
my
own
crew
i
got
respond
with
joy
i
was
received
by
crew
so
happy
all
at
my
rescue
it
must
be
that
some
gentle
soul
did
then
inhabit
that
strange
fowl
but
o
to
me
was
wondrous
fair
for
it
thus
saved
me
from
despair
the
man
my
foe
who
now
doth
growl
at
the
strange
sounds
made
by
the
owl
the
sailors
all
they
took
delight
to
feed
this
bird
so
pure
and
white
but
soon
the
poor
bird
was
early
one
morn
we
found
it
dead
and
my
breast
it
heaved
with
sighs
and
the
tears
poured
from
mine
eyes
but
precious
relic
in
glass
case
i
oft
gaze
on
its
kindly
face
and
grateful
memories
it
brings
when
i
behold
its
glorious
wings
to
stuff
such
birds
i
knew
the
art
on
it
i
worked
with
my
whole
heart
to
preserve
each
grace
and
feature
full
of
charms

me

they
at
him
the
hatchet
threw
he
first
chased
one
and
then
the
other
for
men
on
skates
did
him
bother
but
the
bold
scottish
lad
mcbeth
alas
he
nearly
met
his
death
when
he
so
boldly
did
press
near
to
probe
with
the
sharp
fish
spear
they
knew
their
game
was
no
trifle
so
they
secured
a
trusty
rifle
returning
he
had
fled
to
wood
but
they
traced
him
with
his
blood
they
saw
the
elder
bushes
sway
while
he
did
force
through
them
his
way
they
skated
swiftly
the
ice
and
were
near
brushwood
in
a
trice
full
soon
the
savage
beast
is
slain
with
rifle
bullet
in
his
brain
and
now
these
hunters
do
take
pride
in
skin
as
large
as
buffalo
hide
origin
of
the
toboggan
i
am
a
hunter
by
profession
and
when
i
make
this
confession
of
what
i
saw
with
mine
own
eyes
it
may
cause
you
some
surprise
but
we
at
once
now
you
do
warn
that
this
is
not
a
made
up
yarn
it
happened
in
the
interior
far
north
of
lake
superior
when
up
the
hill
setting
my
traps
i
heard
on
trees
peculiar
raps
it
made
me
then
attentive
hark
and
then
i
heard
pulling
off
the
bark
it
was
a
bright
and
pleasant
day
the
distance
was
three
miles
away
and
it
caused
me
but
slight
alarm
when
they
around
bark
placed
each
arm
and
threw
the
bark
their
shoulder
i
being
a
distant
beholder
knew
not
what
end
they
had
in
view
but
i
must
own
my
wonder
grew
when
i
saw
those
men
were
warm
dressed
with
good
fur
robe
each
one
was
blessed
in
single
file
they
marched
up
hill
with
strangest
thoughts
my
mind
did
fill
when
each
man
in
his
robe
began
with
tough
bark
to
make
toboggan
and
quick
as
lightning
down
they
slide
it
seemed
to
me
a
dangerous
ride
the
spot
was
covered
with
hairs
and
it
seem
mixed
with
blood
of
bears
and
my
two
dogs
bull
and
daisy
at
sight
and
scent
of
it
went
crazy
could
none
of
these
been
a
true
man
or
was
i
gross
deceived
by
bruin
it
was
a
long
and
glassy
slide
reached
far
up
the
mountain
side
they
had
been
first
enjoying
the
fun
of
sliding
down
on
their
bare
skin
until
their
hide
was
getting
worn
and
their
flesh
was
somewhat
torn
so
bear
invented
toboggan
which
is
a
blessing
to
young
man
and
the
fair
maiden
by
his
side
for
both
enjoy
the
pleasant
ride
bear
and
falls
strange
incidents
do
happen
ever
on
the
famed
niagara
river
this
thought
to
mind
it
now
recalls
event
three
miles
above
the
falls
thrilling
ventures
there
abound
a
bear
which
weighed
eight
hundred
pounds
hunters
they
do
him
discover
as
he
was
swimming
down
the
river
they
felt
he
would
be
glorious
prize
this
grand
fat
bear
of
mighty
size
three
men
they
jump
into
canoe
a
skilful
and
determined
crew
soon
alongside
of
him
they
row
but
kindly
feelings
he
doth
show
quick
he
scrambled
the
boat
side
for
to
enjoy
a
good
boat
ride
and
as
the
side
he
straddles
they
hit
him
on
head
with
paddles
but
all
in
vain
so
two
of
crew
a
short
time
bade
the
bear
adieu
and
soon
they
swiftly
swam
to
shore
but
current
down
the
river
bore
man
bear
and
boat
the
sound
appals
of
roaring
mighty
water
falls
but
vigorous
now
he
plys
the
oar
in
hopes
to
safely
reach
the
shore
but
this
made
bear
to
grin
and
growl
and
wear
on
brow
a
horrid
scowl
so
poor
man
sore
against
his
will
finds
that
in
boat
he
must
keep
still
or
else
be
hugged
to
death
by
bear
while
sound
of
falls
becomes
more
near
but
his
two
friends
so
brave
and
true
row
quick
in
a
canoe
and
fire
in
bruin
leaden
balls
thus
saving
friend
from
bear
and
falls
broken
raft
adventure
a
man
on
nova
scotian
bay
on
broken
raft
was
borne
away
right
out
on
the
open
sea
where
the
storm
did
blow
so
free
no
shelter
from
the
wind
or
wave
he
thought
the
gulf
would
be
his
grave
he
had
no
food
life
to
sustain
he
laid
him
down
there
to
remain
what
happened
he
did
know
no
more
but
old
man
on
prince
edward
shore
saw
raft
drifting
near
his
shed
and
thought
the
poor
man
was
quite
dead
he
called
for
help
and
soon
they
bore
his
lifeless
body
to
the
shore
but
old
man
he
did
them
desire
to
place
the
body
near
the
fire
and
wrap
it
up
in
blankets
warm
which
did
act
like
to
a
charm
and
soon
the
breath
it
did
return
with
gratitude
his
heart
did
burn
to
think
he
was
again
restored
unto
his
friends
whom
he
adored
fight
of
a
buffalo
with
wolves
a
buffalo
lord
of
the
plain
with
massive
neck
and
mighty
mane
while
from
his
herd
he
slowly
strays
he
on
green
herbage
calm
doth
graze
and
when
at
last
he
lifts
his
eyes
a
savage
wolf
he
soon
espies
but
scarcely
deigns
to
turn
his
head
for
it
inspires
him
with
no
dread
he
knows
the
wolf
is
treacherous
foe
but
feels
he
soon
could
lay
him
low
a
moment
more
and
there
a
pair
whose
savage
eyes
do
on
him
glare
but
with
contempt
them
both
he
scorns
unworthy
of
his
powerful
horns
their
numbers
soon
do
multiply
but
the
whole
pack
he
doth
defy
he
could
bound
quickly
the
plain
and
his
own
herd
could
soon
regain
his
foes
they
now
are
full
a
score
with
lolling
tongues
pant
for
his
gore
he
hears
their
teeth
all
loudly
gnash
so
eager
his
big
bones
to
crash
on
every
side
they
him
infest
the
north
the
south
the
east
the
west
fierce
rage
doth
now
gleam
from
his
eye
resolved
to
conquer
or
to
die
him
they
yelp
and
howl
and
growl
he
glares
on
them
with
angry
scowl
they
circle
closer
him
around
he
roars
and
springs
with
mighty
bound
and
of
his
powers
gives
ample
proof
felling
them
with
horn
and
hoof
though
some
lay
dead
upon
the
plain
yet
their
attack
was
not
in
vain
for
they
have
tasted
of
his
blood
resolved
it
soon
shall
pour
a
flood
he
feels
that
they
have
torn
his
hide
and
streams
gush
from
each
limb
and
side
he
rushes
on
them
in
despair
and
tosses
them
full
high
in
air
but
others
rush
on
him
and
pull
down
to
the
earth
that
glorious
bull
on
the
flesh
of
this
noble
beast
their
bloody
jaws
they
soon
do
feast
full
worthy
of
a
better
fate
far
from
his
herd
and
his
dear
mate
who
now
do
look
for
him
in
vain
his
bones
do
whiten
now
the
plain
bear
hunt
two
youths
came
over
from
york
state
bill
brown
and
tom
dawes
his
mate
for
many
months
they
were
wishing
the
sport
of
hunting
and
of
fishing
they
rowed
along
the
lake
in
punt
when
tired
of
fishing
they
would
hunt
at
river
mouth
they
caught
fine
trout
in
woods
close
by
they
saw
bear
snout
in
front
of
her
play
little
chubs
fat
and
slick
her
darling
cubs
kind
thoughts
in
their
breasts
they
smother
and
cruelly
they
shoot
the
mother
and
bullet
fearful
tore
her
jaws
a
bloody
wound
but
with
her
paws
erect
in
air
an
awful
sight
she
was
prepared
for
her
young
to
fight
but
this
did
not
daunt
bold
bill
brown
with
club
he
tried
to
knock
her
down
but
she
gave
him
an
awful
hug
with
paws
she
at
him
fierce
did
tug
he
would
been
smothered
but
for
dawes
who
rescued
him
from
her
great
paws
with
club
he
knocked
her
on
the
crown
and
thus
he
saved
the
life
of
brown
she
rose
again
with
savage
frown
and
quickly
broke
two
ribs
for
brown
his
clothes
were
all
torn
with
her
claws
she
smeared
with
blood
both
brown
and
dawes
but
dawes
now
quick
doth
end
the
strife
by
stabbing
her
with
hunting
knife
and
now
around
this
hunter
bold
his
bear
skin
coat
keeps
out
the
cold
coon
hunting
canadians
oft
by
light
of
moon
love
to
go
a
hunting
coon
but
this
our
tale
it
is
no
yarn
while
chopping
down
tree
henry
karn
found
therein
a
hollow
chamber
full
of
coons
who
there
did
clamber
it
made
them
a
home
superior
warm
and
snug
in
the
interior
and
he
did
count
therein
eleven
who
long
had
found
it
a
safe
haven
but
it
is
sad
to
read
their
fate
for
out
of
them
he
slaughtered
eight
but
trouble
to
him
now
occurs
what
shall
he
do
with
those
fine
furs
shall
he
grand
overcoat
display
or
make
them
into
robe
for
sleigh
sailor
yarn
while
voyaging
on
northern
seas
for
days
we
could
not
catch
a
breeze
but
were
held
fast
as
if
in
vice
surrounded
by
the
bergs
of
ice
we
could
not
move
the
ship
or
boat
but
on
low
flat
iceberg
we
did
float
of
provisions
we
took
good
store
with
big
oars
we
rowed
the
berg
to
shore
and
pride
and
joy
each
one
feels
when
we
had
caught
ten
thousand
seals
and
our
brave
boys
each
one
they
dare
to
boldly
capture
great
white
bear
on
floating
berg
we
built
with
boards
a
storehouse
for
to
hold
our
hordes
we
had
a
stove
and
stock
of
coal
so
we
enjoyed
this
voyage
droll
in
centre
of
berg
we
dug
a
hole
and
erected
a
strong
pole
the
frost
and
ice
soon
held
it
fast
and
well
it
served
us
for
a
mast
on
which
we
stretched
out
our
sails
and
scud
along
before
the
gales
until
we
came
to
an
island
and
on
its
sides
it
seemed
highland
and
britain
being
queen
of
seas
for
her
this
island
we
did
seize
to
give
her
new
coaling
station
for
to
benefit
the
nation
so
when
we
had
sailed
landward
we
erected
british
standard
on
the
highest
mountain
top
which
graceful
down
to
sea
did
slope
we
cast
our
anchor
in
its
side
so
to
explore
it
far
and
wide
but
what
was
our
astonishment
without
the
least
admonishment
our
island
soon
away
did
float
as
if
it
was
a
mighty
boat
can
you
believe
this
wondrous
tale
it
proved
to
be
a
monster
whale
and
the
ocean
quick
it
flew
with
our
great
iceberg
and
our
crew
until
it
came
to
newfoundland
where
all
did
safe
on
the
ground
land
poor
whale
was
stranded
on
the
beach
and
his
sea
home
no
more
could
reach
our
crew
in
great
wealth
each
on
shares
by
selling
whale
and
seals
and
bears
we
hired
steam
tug
to
reach
our
ship
now
free
from
ice
we
had
quick
trip
and
she
being
loaded
down
with
seal
and
we
all
shared
in
common
weal
for
joy
each
of
us
had
reason
making
two
trips
in
one
season
hunters
and
trappers
two
hunters
near
to
hudson
bay
their
names
john
grant
and
tom
mckay
their
skill
and
courage
naught
could
daunt
the
boldest
one
perhaps
was
grant
the
winter
was
their
busy
time
when
all
was
snow
and
frost
and
rime
it
paid
best
then
to
pull
trigger
for
then
furs
were
better
thicker
while
setting
trap
grant
cut
through
boot
and
quick
the
blood
gushed
from
his
foot
the
horrid
scene
now
who
can
paint
for
loss
of
blood
soon
makes
him
faint
but
his
kind
partner
tom
mckay
the
rush
of
blood
he
tried
to
stay
and
when
its
flow
did
somewhat
slack
he
carried
him
upon
his
back
as
homeward
he
doth
slowly
go
a
track
of
blood
is
the
snow
but
long
and
weary
is
the
way
and
soon
exhausted
is
mckay
he
feels
assistance
he
doth
want
for
to
rescue
his
dear
friend
grant
he
stood
him
up
against
a
tree
while
the
blood
yet
flowed
quite
free
now
wolves
had
visited
the
trap
and
blood
from
snow
they
eager
lap
then
tracked
poor
grant
for
on
the
snow
the
blood
in
heavy
drops
did
flow
he
soon
got
help
then
john
mckay
doth
hurry
back
without
delay
and
what
a
sight
then
met
their
gaze
filled
them
with
horror
and
amaze
the
sight
their
minds
will
ever
haunt
mangled
by
wolves
was
their
friend
grant
but
round
him
several
wolves
were
slain
with
bullet
holes
right
through
their
brain
for
he
had
fought
hard
for
his
life
and
some
he
slew
with
hunting
knife
and
he
is
still
quite
surrounded
while
fierce
brutes
are
badly
wounded
now
clubs
doth
soon
dash
out
their
brains
and
then
they
gather
grant
remains
they
cut
two
saplings
both
same
size
with
twigs
they
lace
them
acrosswise
so
it
then
made
for
the
poor
dead
a
good
soft
and
pliable
bed
now
to
his
home
remains
they
bear
where
his
poor
wife
is
in
despair
wild
goose
shot
at
midnight
from
the
regions
of
the
north
where
the
waters
now
are
frozen
towards
the
south
they
issue
forth
a
flock
of
wild
geese
of
four
dozen
but
when
they
flew
the
river
thames
they
swooped
down
to
take
a
dive
but
sport
with
shot
gun
at
them
aims
and
one
at
least
did
not
survive
and
he
now
says
it
tasted
fine
and
that
it
was
both
fat
and
big
a
hungry
man
did
on
it
dine
satisfied
with
just
one
leg
he
was
sorry
fowl
to
kill
but
they
awoke
him
from
his
slumber
the
air
with
cackle
they
did
fill
and
thus
they
lost
one
of
their
number
adventures
with
bears
i
bought
of
land
two
miles
square
i
knew
not
it
contained
a
bear
i
never
thought
there
would
be
any
but
alas
i
found
many
the
bush
was
thick
and
mat
and
tangle
it
made
it
a
perfect
jungle
but
one
mile
square
of
good
dry
land
was
enough
for
me
to
take
in
hand
swamp
i
could
reach
but
when
frozen
then
i
saw
bears
by
the
dozen
thick
as
monkies
in
africa
and
many
a
strange
trick
i
saw
gamboling
with
the
greatest
ease
high
up
the
trunks
of
the
big
trees
while
some
were
swinging
from
branches
and
hanging
on
them
with
their
haunches
but
quietly
i
then
tilled
my
farm
the
bears
at
first
done
me
no
harm
till
one
night
i
was
roused
by
dogs
and
found
a
bear
was
at
my
hogs
he
threw
a
pig
across
each
shoulder
and
there
i
was
a
sad
beholder
but
to
the
house
i
quickly
run
for
to
procure
my
loaded
gun
and
as
he
could
not
run
but
slow
so
heavy
laden
through
the
snow
i
him
full
soon
did
overtake
and
his
courage
quick
i
did
shake
for
by
the
leg
my
good
bold
dog
he
bravely
caught
the
thievish
rogue
and
this
move
made
him
soon
fork
to
me
at
once
the
largest
porker
for
moment
squeeze
it
did
pig
stun
but
up
he
rose
and
quick
he
run
the
bear
now
scared
his
only
hope
to
let
at
once
the
other
pig
drop
i
shot
the
bear
right
through
the
eyes
and
secured
a
valued
prize
there
nothing
i
love
so
to
eat
in
winter
time
as
the
bear
meat
so
a
victory
i
soon
won
and
sold
for
high
price
grease
and
skin
the
bears
on
honey
love
to
thrive
one
morn
was
wrecked
my
best
beehive
that
day
i
was
to
sell
the
honey
for
to
raise
some
ready
money
but
bear
my
views
he
did
despise
and
proudly
carried
off
the
prize
that
night
i
set
a
good
spring
gun
with
rails
i
built
for
him
a
run
open
all
way
to
hive
of
bees
he
tried
again
a
hive
to
seize
but
all
his
efforts
were
in
vain
he
sprung
the
gun
and
he
was
slain
the
fact
i
felt
quite
funny
it
well
repaid
me
for
my
honey
one
bear
was
playing
on
me
joke
carrying
off
all
my
young
stock
i
set
my
trap
built
round
it
fence
resolved
he
would
get
from
thence
but
at
the
first
he
did
me
hoax
for
he
was
cunning
as
a
fox
he
dug
under
and
stole
my
bait
but
i
next
sunk
trap
and
sealed
his
fate
my
good
iron
trap
again
it
caught
a
great
bear
but
it
came
to
naught
breakfast
he
had
at
my
expense
and
he
then
showed
wondrous
sense
trap
he
picked
up
with
greatest
ease
and
dashed
it
to
pieces
on
the
trees
but
blacksmith
soon
did
it
repair
for
i
was
bound
to
have
that
bear
i
attached
to
trap
a
heavy
clog
it
was
like
lifting
a
small
log
i
drove
in
it
some
sharp
iron
spikes
which
would
cut
deep
each
time
he
strikes
he
tried
again
to
steal
my
bait
and
break
my
trap
at
the
old
rate
but
he
soon
dashed
out
his
own
brains
his
carcass
it
brought
me
great
gains
a
neighbour
man
who
would
not
work
i
thought
that
he
did
steal
my
pork
but
at
last
i
found
long
black
hairs
then
i
knew
it
was
the
bears
i
put
through
barrels
rods
of
iron
so
they
a
bear
neck
would
environ
and
rods
together
they
would
snap
i
found
him
choked
quite
dead
in
trap
since
then
my
strife
with
bears
did
cease
now
many
years
i
lived
in

the
russian

did
ages
lurk
all
ready
for
to
spring
on
turk
for
russian
statesmen
did
divine
that
they
should
conquer
constantine
but
like
a
greyhound
after
hare
the
lion
did
drive
back
the
bear
and
made
it
feel
the
british
rule
at
gates
of
strong
sebastopol
then
insolent
was
persia
till
lion
had
to
dictate
law
and
while
engaged
in
scenes
like
these
he
was
attacked
by
the
chinese
and
for
this
outrage
all
so
wanton
he
then
resolved
to
seize
on
canton
but
soon
there
came
a
dismal
cry
of
slaughter
britons
from
delhi
the
bengal
tiger
sick
with
gore
did
tremble
at
the
lion
roar
but
britain
got
a
serious
shock
by
losing
of
brave
havelock
but
campbell
a
numerous
foe
full
quick
these
armed
hosts
did
in
abyssinian
dungeons
vile
lay
captives
of
great
britain
isle
but
soon
the
tyrant
theodore
lay
sadly
weltering
in
his
gore
the
savage
tribes
of
ashantee
from
british
troops
did
quickly
flee
in
afghan
and
zulu
wars
many
did
find
their
deadly
scars
in
the
land
of
the
pharaohs
the
christians
suffered
cruel
woes
till
in
alexandria
bay
the
british
iron
clads
did
display
the
mighty
power
they
did
wield
while
their
steel
sides
from
harm
did
shield
and
british
army
on
the
land
marched
bravely
the
burning
sand
and
arabi
found
was
useless
labor
his
strong
trench
of
egyptians
did
not
wish
to
feel
in
their
breasts
cold
british
steel
their
great
power
was
soon
laid
low
and
wolseley
entered

now
no
more

britain
once

alike
on

now
may

forever
cease

ever
live
in

crimean
war
at
the
announcement
that
britain
was
to
declare
war
kossuth
the
hungarian
patriot
declared
in
an
address
in
england
that
the
british
lion
was
a
sea
dog
but
helpless
on
land
when
the
british
lion
offered
aid
to
the
turk
round
many
lips
a
sneer
of
serious
doubt
did
lurk
they
said
he
was
at
home
on
sea
but
when
on
land
he
would
be
as
a
ship
wrecked
upon
the
strand
or
like
some
huge
ungainly
crocodile
upon
the
marshy
banks
of
sluggish
nile
who
could
move
gaily
on
the
deep
but
on
dry
land
could
scarcely
creep
but
up
the
alma
heights
he
rushed
like
greyhound
after
hare
and
in
a
moment
by
the
throat
he
seized
the
russian
bear
which
begged
so
hard
for
mercy
his
life
he
did
it
spare
and
closely
now
it
is
confined
within
its
native
lair
for
its
strong
fortress
of
sebastpol
was
forced
to
submit
to
great
britain
rule
indian

british
infants
who
were
nobly
born
were
from
their
bleeding
mother
bosom
torn
and
with
the
bayonet
dashed
upon
the
street
there
left
to
lie
for
native
dogs
to
eat
but
the
british
lion
he
quick
both
the
high
and
the
low
hindoo
now
they
respect
the
christian

of

a
fable
of
the
british
and
russian
dispute
of
russians
suffer
sad
distress
for
lack
of
freedom
of
the
press
but
oft
times
they
are
full
able
to
enlighten
with
a
fable
and
they
enjoy
a
humorous
tale
of
a
bear
and
monster
whale
the
bear
he
went
to
the
sea
shore
the
mighty
ocean
to
explore
and
this
it
quick
enraged
the
whale
who
beat
the
ocean
with
his
tail
with
foaming
words
he
told
the
bear
that
he
would
strip
his
hide
and
hair
if
he
ever
found
him
more
encroaching
on
his
sea
shore
the
bear
replied
i
will
not
quail
at
frothing
words
of
any
whale
for
you
are
a
lump
of
blubber
whale
rejoined
you
are
land
lubber
thus
bandying
epithets
so
vile
of
bear
grease
and
of
whale
oil
sharks
and
fishes
of
the
ocean
were
thrown
into
great
commotion
the
hawks
and
eagles
of
the
air
lions
and
tigers
gathered
there
bear
he
wished
the
whale
to
slaughter
but
he
was
afraid
of
water
the
great
whale
feared
that
he
might
strand
if
he
ventured
on
the
dry
land
so
at
last
great
russia
bear
went
back
again
to
his
own
lair

content
to
be

monarch
of

and
burnaby
when
the
chinese
did
rebel
gordon
alone
he
could
them
quell
with
justice
they
his

revere
the
man
who
bullets
did
not
fear
it
seemed
as
if
his
life
had
charm
that
spear
or

could
never
harm
he
went
alone
this
wondrous

it
arrives

at
the
centennial
anniversary
of
burns
in
the
year
this
night
shall
never
be
forgot
for
humble
life
none
now
despise
since
burns
was
born
in
lowly
cot
whose
muses
wing
soars
to
the
skies
scotia
brow
he
wove
a
wreath
and
raised
her
name
in
classic
story
a
deathless
fame
he
did
bequeath
his
country
pride
his
country
glory
he
sang
her
hills
he
sang
her
dales
of
bonnie
doon
and
banks
of
ayr
of
death
and
hornbook
and
such
tales
as
tam
and
his
mare
he
bravely
taught
that
manly
worth
more
precious
is
than
finest
gold
he
reckoned
not
on
noble
birth
but
noble
deeds
alone
extolled
where
will
we
find
behind
the
plow
or
in
the
harvest
field
at
toil
another
youth
sweet
bard
like
thou
could
draw
the
tear
or
raise
the
smile
we
do
not
think
was
burns
fault
for
there
were
no
teetotalers
then
that
willie
brewed
a
peck
of
malt
and
robin
preed
like
other
men
is
true
he
loved
the
lasses
dear
but
who
for
this
would
loudly
blame
for
scotia
maids
his
heart
did
cheer
and
love
is
a
true
heavenly
flame
so
here
we
met
in
distant
land
poor
honest
robin
to
extol
though
oft
we
differ
let
us
stand
united
now
in

were

did

did
his

sing

his

oft
to
him
told
and
of

and
of

bold
and
he
himself
would
often
pour
for
hours
reading
wizard
lore
one
night
his
mother
to
the
town
in
a
hurry
sent
him
down
so
his
pony
he
did
stride
and
to
the
town
did
fearful
ride
he
thought
that
demons
they
would
rush
on
him
from
every
rock
and
bush
and
as
he
rode
through
the
quarry
it
did
great
increase
his
flurry
he
felt
that
fiends
with
fiercest
hate
would
surely
there
seal
fast
his
fate
but
town
he
reached
and
his
vest
he
parcel
pressed
close
to
his
breast
the
pony
now
he
mounts
once
more
for
to
pass
quarry
as
before
but
alas
at
that
fatal
spot
he
heard
a
gun
he
was
elf
shot
he
felt
that
from
his
breast
a
flood
was
pouring
down
of
his
heart
blood
but
he
clung
fast
to
pony
back
though
loss
of
blood
his
frame
did
rack
but
in
spite
of
his
alarms
he
resolved
to
die
in
mother
arms
and
when
he
reached
his
own
door
he
said
that
he
was
drenched
in
gore
from
bullet
hole
all
in
his
breast
his
father
opened
up
his

if

up

flew
one
knew
the
other
was
not

test

never
fail
blindfold

advice
to
a
little
girl
the
following
lines
were
written
at
the
request
of
a
little
girl
who
said
she
would
recite
them
at
a
sunday
school
entertainment
blackie
of
edinburgh
in
a
letter
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
my
book
said
he
considered
this
piece
worthy
of
being
committed
to
memory
in
the
public
schools
sir
daniel
wilson
of
toronto
university
also
approves
of
them
as
containing
good
sentiments
and
should
be
impressed
on
the
minds
of
the
young
dressing
in
fashion
will
be
called
vain
and
they
call
you
a
dowdy
if
you
are
plain
but
do
what
is
right
let
that
be
the
test
then
proudly
hold
up
your
head
with
the
best
for
people
will
talk
you
will
never
be
wrong
if
you
do
what
is
right
and
this
course
pursue
with
all
of
your
might
and
if
you
a
child
going
to
school
or
full
grown
up
take
this
for
your
rule
for
people
will
talk
the
best
way
to
do
is
to
let
them
rave
and
they
think
more
of
you
if
you
are
brave
for
no
one
will
ever
think
you
are
rude
if
you
are
determined
for
to
be
good
for
people
will
talk
little
girl
on
her
way
to
sunday
school
class
rude
boys
sometimes
will
not
let
her
pass
but
if
they
see
she
is
not
afraid
they
soon
will
respect
the
brave
little
maid
for
people
will
talk
little
girls
should
learn
to
knit
and
to
sew
then
if
to
womanhood
they
ever
grow
their
hose
they
can
knit
and
make
their
own
dress
and
pathway
of
life
for
others
they
bless
for
people
will
talk
and
their
homes
they
should
make
tidy
and
neat
everything
should
be
so
clean
and
so
sweet
this
line
for
ourselves
out
we
will
chalk

death
his
mother
from
celestial
bower
in
the
day
and
hour
of
her
death
or
heavenly
birth
gazed
again
upon
the
earth
and
saw
her
gentle
loving
boy
once
source
of
fond
maternal
joy
in
anguish
on
a
couch
of
pain
she
knew
that
earthly
hopes
were
vain
and
beckoned
him
to
realms
above
to
share
with
her
the
heavenly
love

mckay
mcleod
a
child
of
three
years
of
age
was
carried
under
a
covered
raceway
upwards
of
one
hundred
yards
the
whole
distance
being
either
covered
with
roadway
buildings
or
ice
a
wondrous
tale
we
now
do
trace
of
little
children
fell
in
race
the
youngest
of
these
little
dears
the
boy
age
is
but
three
years
while
coasting
the
treacherous
ice
these
precious
pearls
of
great
price
the
elder
ruby
the
daughter
was
rescued
from
the
ice
cold
water
but
horrid
death
each
one
did
feel
had
sure
befallen
little
neil
consternation
all
did
fill
and
they
cried
shut
down
the
mill
but
still
no
person
they
could
tell
what
had
the
poor
child
befel
the
covered
race
so
long
and
dark
of
hopes
there
scarcely
seemed
a
spark
was
he
held
fast
as
if
in
vice
wedged
the
timbers
and
the
ice
or
was
there
for
him
ample
room
for
to
float
down
the
narrow
flume
had
he
found
there
a
watery
grave
or
borne
along
on
crest
of
wave
think
of
the
mother
agony
wild
gazing
through
dark
tunnel
for
her
child
but
soon
as
partlo
started
mill
through
crowd
there
ran
a
joyous
thrill
when
he
was
quickly
borne
along
the
little
hero
of
our
song
alas
of
life
there
is
no
trace
and
he
is
black
all
over
face
though
he
then
seemed
as
if
in
death
yet
quickly
they
restored
his
breath
think
now
how
mother
h
she
adored
her
sweet
dear
child
to
her
restored
and
her
boundless
gratitude
unto

is
the

there

graven
in

great
variety
here
belongs
snatches
of
sermons
and
of

here
you
find
are
numerous
themes
both
mighty
thoughts
and
foolish
dreams
here
love
and
hope
so
bright
and
fair
there
hate
and
doubt
and
dark
despair
and
here
is
too
the
bower
of
bliss
where
youthful
lovers
first
did
kiss
here
are
memories
of
childhood
and
of
old
ages

well
the
whole
is
a
strange
sight

of
suffering
and

where
new
hearts
with
yours
do
blend

our
comfort
it
is
given
indented
deep
in
mind
of
wise
are
glories
of
the
heavenly
prize
survival
of
the
fittest
now
let
the
hero
of
our
song
be
he
who
gentle
treats
the
throng
and
would
not
cruel
treat
another
but
to
each
be
as
to
a
brother
and
he
must
have
both
sense
and
wit
and
be
possessed
of
strength
and
grit
then
strong
as
proof
of
holy
writ
for
to
survive
he
is
most
fit
and
according
to
our
test
the
fittest
only
is
the
best
these
have
a
right
for
to
survive
and
well
they
do
deserve
to
thrive
and
this
kind
of
evolution
it
will
bring
no
revolution
but
revolve
in

flows
from

brewed

to
the
thirsty
traveller
a
charming
spot
of
green
is
by
far
the
rarest
gem
his
eyes
have
ever
seen
and
when
he
has
quenched
his
thirst
at
the
cooling
spring
with
many
grateful
songs
he
makes
the
air
to
ring

all
in

month
after

she
passed
in
pain
she
had
no
relative
nor

who
aid
or
comfort
could
her
lend
a
surgeon
saw
her
cheerless
state
and
deplored
the
poor
child
fate
she
tried
to
make
doll
of
her
finger
and
sang
to
it
poor
little
singer
her
indeed
was
an
awful
lot
the
weary
days
she
spent
in
cot
for
the
poor
child
she
could
not
walk
and
it
soon
exhausted
her
to
talk
but
surgeon
bought
her
ribbon
gay
and
with
it
she
all
day
did
play
the
giver
often
she
did
bless
and
thought
sometimes
she
was
princess
for
in
it
she
did
take
such
pride
she
fancied
she
was
beauteous
bride
and
was
possessed
of
great
riches
or
thought
herself
a
wealthy
duchess
and
she
would
bind
it
round
her
hair
imagining
that
she
was
fair
but
poor
child
feels
that
she
must
die
she
asks
the
surgeon
to
come
nigh
and
kindly
her
he
doth
stand
she
asked
him
for
to
take
her
hand
thanked
him
for

green

as
the
sunbeams
when
they
gleam
sparkling
so
bright
upon
the

the
poetry
of
motion
is
ship
sailing
the
ocean
or
when
the
bird
doth
graceful
fly
seeming
to

for
poetry
is
the
pure
cream
and
essence
of
the
common

poetic
thoughts
the

doth
fill
when
on
broad
plain
to
view
a
hill
on
barren
heath
how
it
doth
cheer
to
see
in
distance
herd
of

and
poetry
breathes
in
each
flower
nourished
by
the
gentle
shower
in
song
of
birds
upon
the
trees
and
humming
of

bees
is
solace
for
the
ills
of

a
soothing
of

strife
for

is
a
duty
to
sing
of

his
step
as
well
his
talk
he
is
the
favorite
of
her
choice
so
his
step
familiar
as
his
voice
step
step
step
she
now
is
wed
and
it
is
now
her
husband
tread
his
homeward
step
it
cheers
her
life
for
she
is
a
kind
faithful
wife
but
he
the
husband
and
yet
lover
his
steps
at
last
do
cease
forever
and
she
doth
soon
hear
the
tread
of
men
who
do
bear
out
the
dead
her
heart
it
now
doth
throb
with
pain
though
she
knows
sorrow
is
but
vain
for
him
she
never
can
recall
and
no
more
hear
his
footsteps
fall
but
still
she
hopes
he
yet
will
come
and
visit
her
in
their
old
home
but
time
approaches
she
must
die
her
husband
footsteps
she
hears
nigh
step
step
step
we
shall
part
i
hear
the
echo
in
my
heart
now
happiness
dispels
the
gloom
radiant
with
joy
my
face
doth
bloom
pain
and
suffering
all
are
past
she
joyous
cried
he
come
at
last
and
soon
she
breathes
out
her
last
breath
he
guides
her
through
the
vale
of
death
the
useful
weed
do
not
despise
the
humble
weed
for
the
lord
he
first
sowed
the
seed
perhaps
it
bears
most
precious
fruit
and
useful
leaves
and
potent
root
though
it
seems
now
a
useless
weed
countless
millions
it
yet
may
feed
or
future
ages
it
may
prize
finding
in
it
beauteous
dyes
or
a
valued
healing
balm
will
make
the
heated
pulse
beat
calm
and
the
future
men
of
science
may
place
on
it
strong
reliance
and
it
may
play
important
part
in
advancing
skill
and
art
and
no
person
now
doth
know
how
useful
are
the
weeds
that
grow
weeds
we
now
look
on
with
loathing
they
may
yet
be
used
for
clothing
producing
silken
glossy
coat
or
paper
fine
for
the
bank
note
but
you
at
present
must
take
heed
and
do
not
grow
the
cumbrous
weed
either
in
garden
or
in
field
where
plants
with
profit
now
do
yield
golden
egg
in
ancient
times
we
have
been
told
a
goose
did
lay
an
egg
of
gold
she
did
produce
one
every
day
so
regular
this
goose
did
lay
but
her
stupid
foolish
master
wanted
her
to
lay
them
faster
and
he
at
last
the
goose
did
kill
gold
grist
no
more
came
to
his
mill
but
a
strange
tale
we
now
unfold
in
california
mines
of
gold
there
they
keep
both
hens
and
chickens
the
gravel
scratching
pickings
but
hens
do
find
the
golden
shiner
is
too
heavy
for
their
dinner
for
it
they
can
not
well
digest
as
it
lies
solid
in
their
breast
then
they
are
slain
and
you
behold
in
their
craw
the
shining
gold
made
up
of
particles
so
fine
the
purest
gold
in
all
the
mine
then
how
happy
is
the
miner
when
he
has
sweet
fowl
for
dinner
and
he
doth
find
within
its
craw
a
little
golden
bonanza
and
in
ontario
the
hen
is
worthy
of
the
poet
pen
for
she
doth
well
deserve
the
praise
bestowed
on
her
for
her
fine
lays
little
dora
i
tell
you
what
my
little
dora
you
do
cause
my
heart
to
sorrow
tell
me
now
you
little
misses
what
you
do
with
all
your
kisses
i
see
you
get
them
by
the
dozen
from
each
aunt
and
little
cousin
said
she
i
do
intend
dear
pa
to
give
them
all
to
you
and
ma
and
not
a
single
one
i
miss
but
i
will
give
you
back
each
kiss
and
both
of
you
will
feel
you
blest
when
i
pay
you
interest
you
better
in
my
bank
invest
and
put
my
principle
to
test
and
you
can
dividend
partake
for
my
bank
will
never
break
lines
on
the
death
of
a
farmer
wife
this
good
woman
when
in
this
life
she
was
kind
mother
and
good
wife
and
managed
her
household
with
care
she
and
her
husband
happy
pair
and
her
name
it
will
long
be
praised
by
the
large
family
she
has
raised
she
laid
up
treasures
in
the
skies
and
now
enjoys
the
heavenly
prize
she
rose
each
morn
with
happy
smile
and
ardent
all
the
day
did
toil
for
work
it
to
her
had
a
charm
and
busy
was
each
hand
and
arm
fighting
for
home
a
hawk
while
soaring
on
the
wing
a
tiny
sparkling
spring
beheld
a
sleek
and
beauteous
mink
was
enjoying
a
bath
and
drink
and
though
the
hawk
was
bent
on
slaughter
the
mink
was
more
at
home
on
water
and
it
is
strange
this
curious
quarrel
all
occurred
in
a
sunk
barrel
in
the
township
of
nissouri
there
the
hawk
it
came
to
sorrow
but
it
strove
often
for
to
sink
in
vain
it
strove
to
drown
the
mink
but
mink
it
did
successful
balk
all
the
attacks
were
made
by
hawk
the
bird
was
drenched
it
could
not
fly
and
again
it
soared
on
high
lines
written
in
a
mental
album
where
each
one
expressed
some
sentiment
in
this
album
you
may
trace
if
not
the
lineaments
of
face
there
at
least
you
will
find
photographs
of
the
mind
some
in
earnest
some
in
fun
some
do
lecture
some
do
pun
here
the
maiden
and
the
youth
each
proclaim
some
precious
truth
and
there
is
here
some
fine
pages
written
by
maturer
ages
where
they
show
that
time
is
brief
that
soon
comes
sere
and
yellow
leaf
every
rose
hath
its
thorn
there
was
a
maiden
all
forlorn
she
loved
a
youth
his
name
was
thorn
but
he
was
shy
for
to
disclose
how
he
loved
dear
the
sweet
may
rose
lustre
sweet
it
would
give
to
thorn
if
this
fair
flower
would
it
adorn
said
he
all
other
names
above
your
charming
name
alone
i
love
said
she
of
beauty
is
soon
shorn
unless
that
it
is
joined
to
thorn
it
very
soon
doth
droop
and
die
and
she
heaved
a
gentle
sigh
said
he
we
wed
morn
no
more
from
me
you
shall
be
torn
for
you
will
banish
all
my
woes
and
near
my
heart
i
wear
the
rose
now
little
rose
buds
they
are
born
all
clinging
to
the
parent
thorn
in
grace
and
beauty
each
one
grows
full
worthy
of
the
sweet
may
rose
some
flowers
they
only
shed
their
bloom
in
the
sweet
month
of
leafy
june
but
may
doth
bloom
each
month
in
year
a
fragrant
rose
forever
dear
danger
of
fire
arms
for
to
save
life
one
great
solver
would
be
to
prohibit
the
revolver
weapon
of
coward
and
of
bully
who
slaughter
friends
in
their
folly
let
now
no
man
or
any
boy
with
loaded
arms
ever
toy
showing
off
their
manly
vigor
pointing
to
friend
and
pulling
trigger
and
sending
bullet
through
their
brain
and
then
exclaim
in
mournful
strain
when
friends
with
grief
they
are
goaded
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
loaded
fire
arms
oft
times
do
bring

they

bird
sent
by
providence
a
poor
man
stood
beside
his
door
his
sad
fate
for
to
deplore
for
landlord
heart
would
not
relent
and
seized
his
furniture
for
rent
he
hears
song
sweet
as
from
fairy
and
soon
he
sees
a
canary
into
his
cage
it
did
alight
and
poured
forth
notes
sweet
and
bright
but
owner
of
the
bird
did
mourn
and
sadly
longed
for
its
return
without
it
she
found
no
delight
so
she
did
landlord
bill
requite
the
poor
man
thinks
the
bird
was
sent
by
the
lord
to
pay
up
his
rent
and
he
now
stout
maintains
from
thence
that
there
is
a
kind
providence

in

a
poor

it
ran

upon

not

a

his

with
kindness
it
ran
the
poorest
man
among
the
three
a

he
did

others
gave
in
empty
feeling
but
this
poor
man
he
did
bring

only
lord
doth
prize
who
helps
afflicted
for
to
rise
o
for
a
lodge
o
for
a
lodge
in
some
vast
wilderness
a
man
cried
out
in
his
distress
for
he
was
tired
and
sick
of
life
and
weary
of
this
worldly
strife
and
longed
for
to
be
far
away
from
the
continuous
daily
fray
but
the
fond
partner
of
his
life
his
own
dearest
loving
wife
those
sentiments
did
not
admire
for
fiercely
they
did
rouse
her
ire
said
she
i
never
let
you
budge
to
go
and
join
another
lodge
your
lodges
take
six
nights
each
week
and
still
another

you
seek

you
roam
and
never
enter
your

a
bird
nest
an
old
man
who
had
charge
of
field
with
pride
he
saw
two
birds
did
build
a
broad
capacious
warm
nest
so
full
of
young
with
speckled
breast
and
when
the
old
man
there
did
pass
they
soon
ran
merry
the
grass
but
of
the
youth
they
were
so
shy
they
made
strong
efforts
for
to
fly
youths
tried
with
old
man
to
prevail
to
let
them
blaze
away
at
quail
but
though
they
longed
for
a
fat
pot
at
them
they
never
got
a
shot
no
more
the
old
man
doth
them
shield
for
they
have
flown
to
broader
field
long
may
they
spread
their
wings
and
tail
and
may
no
foe
them
assail

his

was

wore

by
sending
a

of
the

it
lay
in

but
at
last
the
waters
bore

raised
him
up
near
to
the
shore
but
no
one
knew
his
rank
or
station
no
one
knew
his

his

were
genteel

a

glorying

we
replied
as
follows
you
glory
in
your
typewriter
and
its
virtues
you
rehearse
but
we
prefer
the
old
inditer
for
to
write
either
prose
or
verse
and
let
each
man
work
his
will
but
never
never
do
abuse
the
ancient
and
glorious
quill
from
the
wing
of
a
fine
old
goose
all
men
are
brothers
we
are
in
ancient
stories
told
all
were
brothers
in
days
of
old
but
these
with
facts
they
do
not
chime
for
all
mankind
do
love
the
dime
and
worship
the
mighty
dollar
and
admire
the
golden
collar
the
rich
man
washed
with
whitest
lime
the
poor
man
cover
with
slime
but
we
should
try
to
love
each
other
and
treat
each
man
as
our
brother
the
good
man
cheerful
and
happy
was
his
mood
he
to
the
poor
was
kind
and
good
and
he
oft
times
did
find
them
food
also
supplies
of
coal
and
wood
he
never
spake
a
word
was
rude
and
cheer
those
did
sorrows
brood
he
passed
away
not
understood
because
no
poet
in
his
lays
had
penned
a
sonnet
in
his
praise
is
sad
but
such
is
world
ways
humorous

let
others
sing
their
favourite
lay
from
early
morn
till
close
of
day
more
useful
themes
engage
our
pen
we
sing
the
lay
of
our
good
hen
for
she
doth
lay
each
morn
an
egg
and
it
is
full
and
large
and
big
abroad
she
doth
never
travel
happy
she
when
scratching
gravel
and
she
loud
cackles
songs
of
praise
every
morn
when
she
lays
proud
she
is
when
she
finds
pickings
for
to
feed
her
brood
of
chickens
it
greatly
puzzled
her
one
day
when
she
found
white
nest
egg
of
clay
she
knew
some
one
did
trick
play
her
for
she
was

stately

stalks
leading
his
hens
along
the
walks
proudly
each
feather
in
his

muse
now
soars
on
feathery
wing
and
cheerful
it
doth
hail
the
spring
bringing
the
sunshine

of
fish

he
full
soon
did
come
to
grief
he
was

and
brought
before
the

so
judge
he
would

judge
asked
him

the

there
you
will
find
the

the

display
great

the

the

to

we
do
appeal
how
can
you
own
the
whole

and
at
the
same
time
claim
our
cod
if
from
the
shore
a
mile
abroad
snake
and
its
young
there
is
a
peculiar
snake
you
might
almost
call
it
squatter
it
loves
to
dive
in
pond
or
lake
at
home
on
either
land
or
water
but
it
excited
my
good
dog
to
see
small
snakes
bask
in
the
sun
enjoying
themselves
on
a
big
log
near
into
where
the
water
run
but
their
mother
she
was
watching
her
numerous
brood
on
the
log
she
thought
to
them
was
danger
hatching
when
she
beheld
myself
and
dog
for
she
gave
a
hissing
sound
all
her
offspring
to
awake
she
ope
her
mouth
and
at
a
bound
down
her
throat
did
rush
each
snake
i
scarcely
my
own
eyes
could
trust
to
see
those
small
snakes
disappear
i
really
thought
that
she
would
burst
for
the
sake
of
her
offspring
dear
but
i
soon
hid
among
the
brakes
to
view
the
young
ones
leave
their
prison
will
you
believe
this
tale
of
snakes
if
i
did
count
right
just
four
dozen
whale
and
its
foes
six
hundred
miles
north
of
cape
flattery
on
sea
there
seemed
a
floating
battery
and
stream
of
blood
did
dye
the
water
sailors
wondered
what
was
the
matter
but
they
soon
saw
a
great
sword
fish
with
its
bayonet
make
a
quick
rush
into
which
proved
to
be
large
whale
and
thrasher
too
did
it
assail
the
whale
dived
deep
to
save
its
life
but
thrasher
eager
for
the
strife
knew
whale
must
rise
for
to
get
breath
then
it
would
thrash
the
whale
to
death
at
last
the
great
whale
it
arose
and
in
distress
it
spouts
and
blows
in
anger
sweeps
its
mighty
tail
defensive
weapon
of
the
whale
but
thrasher
high
in
air
did
leap
and
fell
on
monster
of
the
deep
the
sword
fish
then
it
did
advance
and
assaulted
it
with
its
lance
thus
united
foes
soon
do
prevail
and
quick
there
floated
a
dead
whale
the
thrasher
now
victorious
winner
from
off
the
whale
expected
dinner
but
ship
crew
they
secured
the
prize
whale
bone
and
blubber
monster

others
fought
but
they
only
reap
the
spoils
of
mammoth
of
the

the
tiger
and
lion
rules
by
the
niger
hunter
heard
shrill
cry
of
peacocks
in
indian
jungles
go
in
flocks
and
he
saw
tiger
crouch
and
spring
to
crush
a
bird
with
beauteous
wing
but
the
tiger
missed
his
aim
and
he
hung
his
head
with
shame
then
there
came
a
mighty
crush
of
elephants
rush
through
the
bush
the
tiger
crouched
on
ground
and
elephants
rushed
in
with
bound
in
front
was
baby
elephant
to
crush
its
bones
did
tiger
want
but
mother
saw
fierce
forest
ranger
and
she
gave
a
cry
of
danger
leader
of
herd
he
madly
rushed
resolved
the
tiger
should
be
crushed
but
tiger
strove
to
run
away
willing
to
relinquish
prey
but
when
he
found
that
he
must
fight
on
elephant
back
he
strove
to
light
but
elephant
struck
him
with
his
foot
and
then
with
tusks
he
did
him
root
so
now
once
more
must
praise
be
sung
to
beasts
who
nobly
fight
for
young
and
grateful
feelings
were
now
stirred
towards
the
leader
of
the
herd
strange
life
preserver
a
sailor
he
was
swept
from
deck
in
minute
he
seem
as
a
speck
tossing
on
each
briny
wave
they
feared
the
sea
would
be
his
grave
though
they
full
quickly
launched
the
boat
they
could
not
see
where
he
did
float
he
now
was
a
long
ways
astern
his
whereabouts
they
could
not
learn
but
while
he
on
the
waves
did
toss
he
was
seized
by
great
albatross
who
had
been
looking
round
in
quest
of
something
whereon
it
could
rest
i
it
hover
him
with
its
wings
and
its
great
webb
feet
on
him
clings
and
it
tore
him
with
its
sharp
beak
for
it
was
longing
for
some
steak
but
sailor
seized
it
by
the
throat
and
found
with
ease
he
then
could
float
so
sailor
life
was
saved
by
loss
of
the
life
of
the
albatross
the
boat
crew
found
him
none
too
soon
for
he
had
fallen
into
a
swoon
him
they
would
not
have
come
across
had
they
not
seen
the
albatross
and
thus
poor
jack
his
life
was
saved
for
fierce
rage
of
bird
he
braved
though
in
a
faint
he
still
did
cling
one
arm
round
neck
and
one
round
wing
for
as
a
friend
he
did
hug
close
that
fine
large
bird
the

loathed
with
his

he
moved

found
a
lump
of

he
turned
away
in
sad
despair
that
could
not

famed
brave

they
pronounce
him
dead
for

bathes
his

he
gazed
far
down

and
a
large
dog
he
could
define
so
eager
busy
on
the
track
in
mouth
it
seemed
to
lift
a
pack
but
it
oftentimes
did
fail
for
to
raise
it
the
rail
the
engineer
put
on
his
steam
and
he
loud
made
his
whistle
scream
so
that
the
dog
would
take
alarm
and
thus
preserve

he
would

last
great
effort
did
prevail
he
raised
it
safe
beyond
the
rail
into
a
snug
and
hollow
spot
a
place

formed
for
a

this
dog
of
noble
mastiff
breed
for
his
own
safety
took
no
heed
but
at
approaching
train
did
bark
to
make
them

the

did
sad
bewail

see
the

on

they
thought

distant
was

strife
and
left
their
little
girl
at
home
while
they
to
distant
village
roam
and
thus
saved
their
lives
from
slaughter
but
rebels
carried
off
their

their

woman
a
hindoo
they
knew
her
to
be
kind
and

it
almost
drove
her
crazy
wild
to

them
dragging
off
the
child
the
colonel
soon
he
doth
return
and
in
his
breast
fierce
rage
doth
burn
he
knows
the
child
is
doomed
to
die

he
the
rebels
will
defy
so

on

he
knew
the

soon
would
rise

quick
he
carried
off
the
prize
though
love
for
child
he
does
not
feel
he
only
wants
her
for
a
meal
he
ran
with
her
towards
the
south
carrying
her
in
his
broad
mouth
the
colonel
had
a
strong
desire
on
this
savage
beast
for
to
fire
but
from
it
he
refrained
for
fear
the
ball
might
strike
his
little
dear
he
saw
that
brute
was
now
weary
running
with
his
little
dearie
so
he
then
quickly
gave
it
chase
and
full
soon
then
he
gained
the
race
the
coward
beast
then
dropped
the
child
and
fled
away
in
terror

with
joy

he
doth
weep
when
he
finds

still
asleep

on
it
neither

face
and
now
he
takes
it
in
his
arms
with
joy

its

boat
which
tempestuous
sea
did
float
they
rescued
all
the
crew
save
one
and
were
content
with
what
they
done
but
they
had
not
their
captain
harry
who
on
the
shore
was
forced
to
tarry
and
knew
not
of
the
disaster
so
crew
had
worked
without
a
master
but
when
he
heard
of
the
shipwreck
and
that
a
man
was
left
on
deck
he
quickly
hurried
the
boat
crew
for
to
again
attempt
his
rescue
but
earnestly
his
old
mother
reminded
him
of
his
lost
brother
perhaps
drowned
in
foreign
sea
she
cried
son
stay
and
comfort
me

providence
rewards
the

who
strive

griefs
it
did
assuage
and
happy

is

shoe
black
gent
on
sidewalk
held
out
his
foot
while
boy
in
gutter
brushed
his
boot
but
at
this
time
how
sad
alas
an
unruly
horse
did
him
pass
the
child
for
friends
he
sad
did
lack
they
said
he
was
but
a
shoeblack
kind
hearted
man
the
poor
child
bore
to
a
soft
cot
in
back
of
store
and
brought
from
hospital
ward
a
skilful
nurse
the
lad
to
guard
she
often
listened
for
his
breath
as
he
was
passing
the
vale
of
death
but
poor
child
once
he
ope
his
eyes
and
he
looked
round
in
great
surprise
feebly
he
asked
heaving
a
sigh
where
in
the
world
now
am
i
the
tender
nurse
bent
his
face
and
said
dear
boy
you
in
good
place
she
asked
his
name
he
said
it
was
tom
and
that
for
long
he
had
no
home
and
since
his
mother
was
stricken
dead
he
had
not
once
reposed
in
bed
and
while
suffering
child
did
rack
he
eagerly
asked
will
mother
come
back
the
nurse
she
gently
answered
no
but
to
your
dear
mother
you
can
go
in
his
last
sleep
he
had
a
dream
shining
up
boots
it
was
his
theme
he
soon
awoke
and
called
out
mother
i
see
you
and
little
brother
christ
i
know
has
me
forgiven
for
they
are
beckoning
me
to

duck
and
oyster
once
on
a
time
there
lived
a
duck
and
by
its
fishing
it
did
thrive
so
one
day
it
longed
to
suck
an
oyster
and
for
one
did
dive
the
oyster
near
shore
lay
open
the
duck
its
gizzard
for
to
fill
resolved
that
he
would
pop
in
between
the
shells
his
sharp
bill
and
then
he
would
have
glorious
treat
but
oyster
closed
on
it
its
shell
and
duck
it
got
no
oyster
meat
but
worse
than
that
the
duck
befell
this
oyster
was
so
very
large
it
held
the
duck
head
under
water
and
towed
small
oysters
like
a
barge
each
one
clung
to
it
like
squatter
duck
it
died
of
too
much
moisture
and
it
floated
towards
the
beach
and
to
its
bill
clung
big
oyster
sticking
to
it
like
a
horse
leach
on
the
shore
there
stood
a
shyster
watching
fat
duck
floating
to
him
and
the
wondrous
big
oyster
how
fine
it
would
be
to
stew
them
alas
the
duck
lost
its
dinner
and
at
the
same
time
lost
its
life
but
on
it
dined
a
hungry
sinner
who
did
reap
all
the
spoils
of
strife
for
when
the
duck
to
land
did
float
it
towed
small
oysters
not
a
few
for
it
sailed
like
to
a
boat
with
fat
duck
pie
and
oyster
stew
none
can
the
poor
duck
fate
bewail
for
it
reckoned
without
its
host
it
strove
for
conquest
and
did
fail
fighting
for
spoil
it
battle
lost
you
see
the
wild
duck
did
not
know
when
it
attacked
the
big
oyster
it
had
to
fight
a
numerous
foe
of
these
shell
fish
a
whole
cluster
borne
feathers
on
briny
billow
they
were
full
of
springy
down
and
they
made
a
glorious
pillow
where
fellow
he
could
rest
his
crown
this
chap
he
did
not
plow
nor
sow
but
from
sea
and
land
he
did
reap
the
wealth
that
others
caused
to
grow
and
thus
he
treasures
up
did
heap
baby
darling
a
miner
in
california
mine
for
his
distant
home
he
did
repine
in
a
far
off
eastern
state
where
did
live
his
own
dear
mate
and
one
great
source
of
all
his
joy
his
little
darling
baby
boy
one
night
to
drive
his
cares
away
to
concert
hall
his
footsteps
stray
and
loud
resounding
the
hall
he
heard
a
little
boy
squall
the
sweetest
music
he
heard
sweeter
far
than
singing
bird
for
his
thoughts
it
caused
to
roam
to
his
distant
eastern
home
near
to
the
mine
there
were
no
trace
of
baby
dear
or
woman
face
when
violinist
with
his
bow
did
make
exquisite
music
flow
the
miner
he
did
loudly
bawl
stop
fiddle
and
let
baby
squall
my
sad
heart
his
cries
doth
cheer
reminding
me
of
my
own
dear
for
sooner
i
would
him
behold
than
if
i
found
a
mine
of
gold
for
what
are
all
the
joys
of
life
so
far
away
from
child
and
wife
but
few
more
months
i
will
stay
here
then
join
my
wife
and
baby
dear
riding
an
avalanche
with
our
canadian
snow
shoes
snow
you
walk
you
choose
but
on
long
shoes
norwegian
they
are
like
narrow
toboggan
and
all
your
movements
you
control
by
the
aid
of
a
stout
long
pole
with
it
you
balance
or
propel
but
we
show
now
what
once
befell
two
miners
full
of
pluck
and
game
wished
to
locate
a
mining
claim
on
a
high
steep
mountain
crest
in
colorado
of
the
west
though
snow
was
deep
they
would
attempt
their
good
mine
for
to
so
up
the
mountain
they
do
climb
covered
with
snow
and
rime
norwegian
shoes
slide
over
the
snow
high
and
higher
still
they
go
one
was
two
hundred
yards
ahead
till
snow
gives
way
where
he
doth
tread
which
quickly
starts
an
avalanche
he
seizes
on
a
stout
tree
branch
but
all
in
vain
he
rushes
fast
his
snow
shoes
in
the
avalanche
his
friend
on
shoes
norwegian
like
lightning
down
the
hill
he
ran
or
rather
the
ice
did
glide
down
the
long
steep
and
glassy
slide
and
after
him
the
avalanche
tearing
up
trees
both
root
and
branch
the
man
on
avalanche
doth
yell
to
his
friend
you
are
doing
well
with
your
shoes
norwegian
swifter
than
a
toboggan
go
on
go
on
you
win
the
race
for
we
are
in
our
pace
but
alas
poor
runner
feels
the
avalanche
doth
touch
his
heels
shall
he
be
buried
in
the
mass
or
will
the
vast
pile
him
pass
he
stops
quite
sudden
a
rock
it
passed
him
with
mighty
shock
though
it
did
cause
him
great
alarm
yet
still
he
was
all
safe
from
harm
the
avalanche
yet
downward
slides
and
his
friend
on
it
he
rides
until
it
safely
him
doth
launch
on
outer
edge
of
his
own
ranch
after
three
miles
down
the
gulch
they
both
might
have
been
crushed
to
mulch
the
one
he
seemed
to
run
a
race
while
one
on
avalanche
did
chase
but
it
was
not
for
bravado
one
rode
one
run
in
colorado
for
it
was
desperate
the
strife
each
had
for
to
secure
his
life
this
tale
of
shoes
norwegian
is
not
for
the
collegian
but
for
such
youths
as
do
take
pride
in
reading
of
a
wondrous
slide
