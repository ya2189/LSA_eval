long

yes
oh
so
long
since
when
the
world
was
young
and
fair
all
the
animals
were
friendly
the
bison
and
the
bear
aided
man
with
all
their
cunning
helped
him
with
their
counsels
grave
helped
him
as
the
gods
alone
can
made
him
wise
and
strong
and
brave
and
the
flowers
on
the
prairies
blossomed
ever
shy
and
sweet
for
the
land
of
the
dakotas
knew
not
frost
nor
killing
heat
but
there
lived
a
dread
god
north
wind
cruel
was
he
with
heart
of
stone
feared
of
all
and
loved
by
no
one
living
to
himself
alone
in
the
land
of
snow
and
blizzard
in
the
land
of
deadening
cold
plotting
ever
some
new
mischief
some
new
ravage
cruel
and
bold
and
one
day
this
mighty
north
wind
left
his
throne
of
ice
and
snow
in
the
cold
far
distant
northland
where
the
wriggling
glow
southward
came
he
and
the
flowers
bent
their
lovely
heads
in
death
for
from
out
his
icy
nostrils
came
an
at
the
mighty
stately
forests
angrily
his
teeth
he
gnashed
with
one
mighty
blow
he
felled
them
and
with
chains
the
rivers
lashed
ceased
their
laughter
and
their
murmur
ceased
their
sweet
all
the
birds
and
beasts
in
terror
fled
and
knew
not
where
to
go
food
they
found
not
and
no
shelter
dying
were
the
mortals
all
and
a
slow
relentless
snow
shroud
draped
the
earth
as
with
a
death
supreme
reigned
loud
the
north
wind
roared
defiance
to
the
gods
birds
and
beasts
and
man
in
terror
fled
and
dying
called
the
gods
to
avenge
their
death
and
suffering
to
unite
them
one
and
all
in
the
holy
cause
of
vengeance
to
secure
the
north
wind
and
the
south
wind
fairest
maiden
of
the
gods
took
up
their
cause
girded
now
herself
for
battle
and
after
a
moment
pause
called
unto
her
loyal
brothers
the
strong
east
wind
and
the
west
help
revenge
the
suffering
mortals
and
they
granted
her
request
strong
the
fight
raged
in
dakota
the
north
wind
and
his
foes
now
one
side
yields
now
the
other
fierce
and
loud
the
tempest
blows
savagely
the
monster
charges
grappling
with
his
unseen
foes
while
a
wild
chaotic
blizzard
such
as
was
seen
arose
hiding
all
within
its
fury
made
the
daylight
dark
as
night
for
the
very
gods
were
grappling
in
a
last
terrific
ages
long
the
battle
lasted
then
the
maiden
fair
and
lovely
smiled
benignant
on
her
foe
and
his
very
heart
was
melting
for
was
made
of
ice
and
snow
loosed
the
rivers
from
their
bondage
vanished
now
the
shroud
of
snow
and
north

prairies
flowers
fair
began
to
grow
with
the
advent
of
the
flowers
came
the
birds
and
beasts
and
man
built
again
their
homes
and
wigwams
and
no
more
they
anxious
scan
the
horizon
for
the
north
wind
knowing
that
he
met
his
fate
but

wends
his
way

dakotas
where
the
battle
once
took
place

my

lips
can
not
tell
nor
words
nor
actions
half
as
well
as
my
full
heart
would
wish
but
sometimes
in
another
land
when
we
have
reached
the
golden
strand
i
know
you
surely
understand
a
dream
it
was
midnight
and
those
spirits
who
men
destinies
control
were
in
solemn
court
assembled
waiting
for
the
bell
to
toll
the
final
hour
of
the
year
and
what
happened
you
will
hear
elves
and
gnomes
and
dwarfs
came
tripping
on
the
light
fantastic
toe
from
their
distant
caves
and
castles
in
the
land
of
ice
and
snow
and
the
white
and
hoary
from
his
throne
arose
and
spoke
fellow
spirits
all
i
greet
you
and
just
then
old
father
time
rang
out
the
old
year
friends
i
feel
our
power
is
waning
man
our
ward
is
now
proclaiming
among
others
a
most
curious
thing
that
in
a
chair
he
likes
to
swing
because
his
ancestor
an
ape
was
very
apt
to
use
his
tape
to
swing
himself
from
limb
to
limb
of
trees
and
vines
which
on
them
cling
moreover
he
is
now
so
learnéd
that
to
a
fossil
he
is
turnèd
instead
of
joining
our
free
band
of
spirits
in
the
fairy
land
silence
reigned
supreme
a
moment
then
an
old
dwarf
ripe
with
age
arose
and
all
those
elves
and
fairies
bowed
their
heads
a
little
space
for
that
grand
old
man
whose
wisdom
in
that
hall
rang
loud
and
clear
time
has
come
when
man
no
longer
feels
he
needs
invoke
our
aid
for
creation
now
he
tells
us
by
itself
was
surely
made
blind
he
is
to
nature
teachings
and
so
wise
in
his
conceit
that
he
would
forget
the
lessons
taught
by
wayside
flowers
sweet
by
the
river
and
the
mountain
and
the
myriad
things
that
creep
upon
the
earth
and
this
wondrous
human
being
calls
himself
but
a
machine
classed
among
the
things
he
fashions
from
the
metals
earth
doth
yield
ah
his
very
heart
is
hardening
love
no
longer
can
hold
sway
when
the
heir
of
all
creation
says
he
only
made
of
clay
i
awoke
from
my
light
slumber
at
the
new
year
earliest
beam
pondering
deeply
if
a
lesson
could
be
learned
from
a
dream
the
light
the
way
is
long
the
night
is
drear
i
stumble
on
through
doubt
and
fear
my
heart
grows
numb
all
hope
takes
flight
oh
father
let
me
see
the
light
was
it
for
me
that
he
has
died
was
it
for
me
the
crucified
bore
the
deep
anguish
in
the
night
oh
father
let
me
see
the
light
o
doubting
child
look
up
and
see
it
was
for
sinners
such
as
thee
christ
conquered
sin
and
death
and
night
look
up

night
watches
in
the
still
watches
of
night
long
ere
the
dawn
comes
over
the
eastern
skies
think
of
the
hearts
that
are
breaking
oh
hear
the
moans
and
the
sobbing
feel
how
the
pulses
are
throbbing
just
because
some
one
was
oh
was
that
someone
you
men
are
three
there
are
all
kinds
of
people
we
meet
on
the
road
as
we
travel
along
life
way
and
some
are
surly
and
some
are
grave
and
others
are
jolly
and
gay
and
some
folks
are
short
while
others
are
tall
still
others
are
skinny
and
thin
and
some
skip
along
a
song
but
others
are
simply
all
in
but
they
come
from
or
whither
they
go
we
each
of
them
so
we
group
them
and
sort
them
and
label
them
all
the
short
ones
the
skinny
and
tall
there
the
man
or
the
woman
the
boy
or
the
girl
that
always
a
share
in
somebody
fortune
or
somebody
fame
yes
they
wish
for
the
moon
up
then
there
that
group
of
persons
who
talk
talk
and
talk
you
simply
do
know
what
they
say
from
morning
till
night
they
keep
talking
away
and
the
night
is
like
unto
the
but
quietly
along
on
the
very
same
road
walk
others
with
little
to
say
and
if
they
have
wishes
what
mortals
have
not
they
put
them
discreetly
away
they
the
workers
the
lifters
of
burdens
who
dare
to
fight
for
the
right
if
need
be
alone
a
world
and
defiance
they
hurl
to
all
tyrants
wherever
they
be
you
have
met
these
three
classes
of
people
i
sure
as
you
traveled
adown
life
way
the
folks
with
their
enormously
grown
and
the
who
talk
all
the
and
i
know
you
have
shunned
them
as
others
have
done
from
the
day
that
time
began
but
you
hailed
with
delight
and
you
longed
for
the
sight
of
the
steady
quiet
man
smiles
and
tears
swift
run
the
hours
on
to
days
and
days
to
years
and
each
and
every
one
is
filled
with
smiles
or
tears
sometimes
the
skies
are
the
day
but
when
the
sun
shall
smile
again

who
can
say
columbia

shakespeare

long
for
the
peace
of
the
woods
for
the
sighing
of
winds
in
the
pine
trees
and
the
laughter
of
running
brooks
the
chatter
of
squirrel
and
chipmunk
the
call
of
the
shy
wood
oh
the
forest
the
place
to
listen
to
that
grandest
of
anthems
love
ere
the
darksome
shades
of
the
forest
have
vanished
at
early
dawn
a
million
happy
creatures
are
chanting
their
morning
psalm
they
sing
of
the
joy
of
living
in
happiness
peace
and
love
and
gratefully
raise
their
voices
to
the
great
above
and
i
in
a
gladsome
spirit
join
in
with
the
happy
throng
sustained
and
strengthened
and
soothed
by
nature
mighty
and
oft
when
i
come
to
the
city
i
long
for
that
song
of
love
that
the
forest
happy
creatures
raise
to
the
father
above
keep
the
path
clear
oh
do
not
trifle
with
friendship
i
pray
guard
it
more
closely
each
day
gifts
the
most
precious
and
gold
can
not
pay
for
friendship
once
broken
it
vanished
for
aye
keep
clear
the
path
to
your
friend
heart
i
pray
weeds
of
forgetfulness
soon
choke
the
way
pass
that
way
often
keep
polished
i
pray
the
flagstones
that
guide
you
down
friendship
own
way
