of
a
thousand
lures
and
all
the
swift
persuasion
of
the
spring
surged
from
the
stars
and
stones
and
swept
me
on
the
smell
of
honeysuckles
keen
and
clear
startled
and
shook
me
with
the
sudden
thrill
of
some
but
voice
a
slender
stream
became
a
naked
sprite
flashed
around
curious
bends
and
winked
at
me
beyond
the
turns
alert
and
mischievous
a
saffron
moon
dangling
among
the
trees
seemed
like
a
toy
balloon
caught
in
the
boughs
flung
there
in
sport
by
some
breeze
and
as
it
hung
there
vivid
and
unreal
the
whole
world
lethargy
was
brushed
away
the
night
kept
tugging
at
my
torpid
mood
and
tore
it
into
shreds
a
warm
air
blew
my
wintry
slothfulness
beyond
the
stars
and
over
all
indifference
there
streamed
a
myriad
urges
in
one
rushing
wave
touched
with
the
lavish
miracles
of
earth
i
felt
the
brave
persistence
of
the
grass
the
far
desire
of
rivulets
the
keen
unconquerable
fervor
of
the
thrush
the
endless
labors
of
the
patient
worm
the
lichen
strength
the
prowess
of
the
ant
the
constancy
of
flowers
the
blind
belief
of
ivy
climbing
slowly
toward
the
sun
the
eternal
struggles
and
eternal
deaths
and
yet
the
groping
faith
of
every
root
out
of
old
graves
arose
the
cry
of
life
out
of
the
dying
came
the
deathless
call
and
thrilling
with
a
new
sweet
restlessness
the
thing
that
was
my
boyhood
woke
in
me
dear
foolish
fragments
made
me
strong
again
valiant
adventures
dreams
of
those
to
come
and
all
the
vague
heroic
hopes
of
youth
with
fresh
abandon
like
a
fearless
laugh
leaped
up
to
face
the
heaven
unconcern
and
then
veil
upon
veil
was
torn
aside
stars
like
a
host
of
merry
girls
and
boys
danced
gaily
me
plucking
at
my
hand
the
night
scorning
its
ancient
mystery
leaned
down
and
pressed
new
courage
in
my
heart
the
hermit
thrush
throbbing
with
more
than
song
sang
with
a
happy
challenge
to
the
skies
love
and
the
faces
of
a
world
of
children
swept
like
a
conquering
army
through
my
blood
and
beauty
rising
out
of
all
its
forms
beauty
the
passion
of
the
universe
flamed
with
its
joy
a
thing
too
great
for
tears
and
like
a
wine
poured
itself
out
for
me
to
drink
of
to
be
warmed
with
and
to
go
refreshed
and
strengthened
to
the
ceaseless
fight
to
meet
with
confidence
the
cynic
years
battling
in
wars
that
never
can
be
won
seeking
the
lost
cause
and
the
brave
defeat
prayer
god
though
this
life
is
but
a
wraith
although
we
know
not
what
we
use
although
we
grope
with
little
faith
give
me
the
heart
to
fight
and
lose
ever
insurgent
let
me
be
make
me
more
daring
than
devout
from
sleek
contentment
keep
me
free
and
fill
me
with
a
buoyant
doubt
open
my
eyes
to
visions
girt
with
beauty
and
with
wonder
lit
but
let
me
always
see
the
dirt
and
all
that
spawn
and
die
in
it
open
my
ears
to
music
let
me
thrill
with
spring
first
flutes
and
drums
but
never
let
me
dare
forget
the
bitter
ballads
of
the
slums
from
compromise
and
things
keep
me
with
stern
and
stubborn
pride
and
when
at
last
the
fight
is
won
god
keep
me
still
unsatisfied
to
arms
who
can
be
dull
or
wrapped
in
unconcern
knowing
a
world
so
clamorous
and
keen
a
world
of
ardent
conflict
honest
spleen
and
healthy
hot
desires
too
swift
to
turn
vivid
and
vulgar
with
no
heart
to
learn
see
how
that
drudge
a
thing
unkempt
unclean
laughs
with
the
royal
laughter
of
a
queen
even
in
her
the
eager
fires
burn
who
can
be
listless
in
these
stirring
hours
when
with
athletic
courage
we
engage
to
storm
with
fierce
abandon
sterner
powers
and
meet
indifference
with
a
joyful
rage
thrilled
with
a
purpose
and
the
dream
that
towers
out
of
this
arrogant
and
blundering
age
on
the
birth
of
a
child
jerome
epstein
august
lo
to
the
of
life
child
you
have
come
like
a
conquering
shout
out
of
a
struggle
into
strife
out
of
a
darkness
into
doubt
girt
with
the
fragile
armor
of
youth
child
you
must
ride
into
endless
wars
with
the
sword
of
protest
the
buckler
of
truth
and
a
banner
of
love
to
sweep
the
stars
about
you
the
world
despair
will
surge
into
defeat
you
must
plunge
and
grope
be
to
the
faltering
an
urge
be
to
the
hopeless
years
a
hope
be
to
the
darkened
world
a
flame
be
to
its
unconcern
a
blow
for
out
of
its
pain
and
tumult
you
came
and
into
its
tumult
and
pain
you
go
how
much
of
godhood
how
much
of
godhood
did
it
take
what
purging
epochs
had
to
pass
ere
i
was
fit
for
leaf
and
lake
and
worthy
of
the
patient
grass
what
mighty
travails
must
have
been
what
ages
must
have
moulded
me
ere
i
was
raised
and
made
akin
to
dawn
the
daisy
and
the
sea
in
what
great
struggles
was
i
felled
in
what
old
lives
i
labored
long
ere
i
was
given
a
world
that
held
a
meadow
butterflies
and
song
but
oh
what
cleansings
and
what
fears
what
countless
raisings
from
the
dead
ere
i
could
see
her
touched
with
tears
pillow
the
little
weary
head
the
great
carousal
oh
do
not
think
me
dead
when
i
beneath
a
bit
of
earth
shall
lie
think
not
that
aught
can
ever
kill
my
arrogant
and
stubborn
will
my
buoyant
strength
my
eager
soul
my
stern
desire
shall
keep
me
whole
and
lift
me
from
the
drowsy
deep
i
shall
not
even
yield
to
sleep
for
death
can
never
take
from
me
my
warm
insatiate
energy
he
shall
not
dare
to
touch
one
part
of
the
gay
challenge
of
my
heart
and
i
shall
laugh
at
him
and
lie
happy
beneath
a
laughing
sky
for
i
have
fought
too
joyously
to
let
the
conqueror
conquer
me
i
know
that
after
strengthening
strife
death
can
not
quench
my
love
of
life
rob
me
of
my
dear
self
my
ears
of
music
or
my
eyes
of
tears
no
death
shall
come
in
friendlier
guise
the
cloths
of
darkness
from
my
eyes
he
shall
roll
back
and
lo
the
sea
of
silence
shall
not
cover
me
he
shall
make
soft
my
final
bed
stand
like
a
servant
at
my
head
and
thrilled
with
all
that
death
may
give
i
shall
lie
down
to
rest
and
live
and
i
shall
know
within
the
earth
a
softer
but
a
deeper
mirth
the
wind
shall
never
troll
a
song
but
i
shall
hear
it
borne
along
and
echoed
long
before
he
passes
by
all
the
little
unborn
grasses
i
shall
be
clasped
by
roots
and
rains
feeding
and
fed
by
living
grains
there
shall
not
be
a
single
flower
above
my
head
but
bears
my
power
and
every
butterfly
or
bee
that
tastes
the
flower
shall
drink
of
me
ah
we
shall
share
a
lip
to
lip
carousal
and
companionship
the
storm
like
some
great
blustering
lout
shall
play
his
games
with
me
and
shout
his
joy
to
all
the
autumn
and
shall
scamper
by
and
send
his
hosts
of
leaves
like
brown
and
merry
ghosts
to
frolic
over
me
and
stones
shall
feel
the
dancing
in
their
bones
and
winter
too
shall
be
a
jovial
for
me
setting
the
startled
hours
ringing
with
boisterous
tales
and
lusty
singing
and
like
a
mother
that
has
smiled
for
years
on
every
tired
child
summer
shall
hold
me
in
her
lap
and
when
the
root
stirs
and
the
sap
climbs
anxiously
beyond
the
boughs
and
all
the
friendly
worms
carouse
then
oh
how
proudly
we
shall
sing
bravuras
for
the
feet
of
spring
and
i
shall
lie
forever
there
like
some
great
king
and
watch
the
fair
young
spring
dance
on
for
me
and
know
that
love
and
rosy
valleys
glow
her
blithe
feet
touch
the
earth
and
headlong
joy
and
reckless
mirth
seeing
her
footsteps
shall
pursue
oh
i
shall
watch
her
smile
and
strew
laughter
and
life
with
either
hand
and
every
quiver
of
the
land
shall
pierce
me
while
a
joyful
wave
beats
in
upon
my
radiant
grave
aye
like
a
king
in
deathless
state
i
shall
be
throned
and
contemplate
the
dying
of
the
years
the
vast
vague
panorama
of
the
past
the
march
of
centuries
the
surge
of
ages
but
the
deathless
urge
shall
stir
me
always
and
my
will
shall
laugh
to
keep
me
living
still
thrilling
with
every
call
and
cry
too
much
in
love
with
life
to
die
content
to
touch
the
earth
to
hear
the
whisper
of
each
waiting
year
to
help
the
stars
go
proudly
by
to
speed
the
timid
grass
and
lie
sharing
with
every
movement
breath
the
rich
eternity
of
death
thanks
thank
god
for
this
bright
frailty
of
life
the
lyric
briefness
of
its
reckless
spring
thank
god
for
all
the
swift
adventuring
the
bold
uncertainty
the
rousing
strife
thank
god
the
world
is
set
to
such
a
tune
that
life
is
such
a
proud
and
crashing
wave
that
none
but
lifeless
things
shall
be
time
slave
like
the
but
never
tiring
moon
that
godlike
passion
strangely
leaps
and
runs
that
youth
can
not
grow
old
nor
beauty
stale
that
even
death
is
fragile
and
must
fail
before
the
wind
of
joy
that
speeds
the
suns
god
youth
i
often
wish
that
i
had
been
alive
ere
god
grew
old
before
his
eyes
were
tired
of
the
eternal
circlings
of
the
sun
of
the
perpetual
springs
the
weary
years
forever
marching
on
an
unknown
quest
the
yawning
seasons
pacing
to
and
fro
like
stolid
sentinels
to
guard
the
earth
i
wish
that
i
had
been
alive
when
he
was
still
delighted
with
each
casual
thing
his
mind
could
fashion
when
his
soul
first
thrilled
with
childlike
pleasure
at
the
blooming
sun
when
the
first
dawn
met
his
enraptured
eyes
and
the
first
prayers
of
men
stirred
in
his
heart
with
what
a
glow
of
pride
he
heard
the
stars
rush
by
him
singing
as
they
bravely
leaped
into
the
unexplored
and
endless
skies
bearing
his
beauty
like
a
or
watched
the
light
obedient
to
his
will
spring
out
of
nothingness
to
answer
him
hurling
strange
suns
and
planets
in
its
joy
of
fiery
freedom
from
the
lifeless
dark
but
more
than
all
the
splendid
heavens
he
made
the
elements
the
harnessed
worlds
in
spite
of
these
it
must
have
pleased
him
most
to
feel
himself
branch
out
let
go
dare
all
give
utterance
to
his
desires
and
loose
a
flood
of
fancies
wild
and
frank
oh
those
were
noble
times
those
gay
attempts
those
vast
and
droll
experiments
that
were
made
when
god
was
young
and
blithe
and
whimsical
when
from
the
infinite
humor
of
his
heart
he
made
the
elk
with
such
extravagant
horns
the
grotesque
the
that
make
the
ocean
depths
a
visual
heaven
the
animals
like
plants
the
plants
like
beasts
the
loud
inane
hyena
and
the
great
impossible
giraffe
whose
silly
head
threatens
the
stars
his
feet
embracing
earth
the
paradox
of
the
peacock
whose
bright
form
is
like
a
brilliant
trumpet
and
his
voice
a
strident
squawk
a
cackle
and
a
joke
the
ostrich
like
a
snake
tied
to
a
bird
all
out
of
sense
and
drawing
wilder
far
than
all
the
mad
fantastic
thoughts
of
men
the
camel
like
a
lump
of
clay
thumbed
at
for
hours
and
then
thrown
aside
the
elephant
with
splendid
useless
tooth
and
nose
and
arm
and
fingers
all
in
one
the
hippopotamus
absurd
and
bland
oh
how
god
must
have
laughed
when
first
he
saw
these
great
jests
breathe
and
love
and
walk
about
and
how
the
heavens
must
have
echoed
him
for
greater
than
his
beauty
or
his
wrath
was
god
vast
mirth
before
his
back
was
bent
with
time
and
all
the
troubling
universe
ere
he
grew
dull
and
weary
with
creating
oh
to
have
been
alive
and
heard
that
laugh
thrilling
the
stars
convulsing
all
the
earth
while
meteors
flashed
from
out
his
sparkling
eyes
and
even
the
eternal
placid
night
forgot
to
lift
reproving
fingers
smiled
and
joined
indulgent
in
the
merriment
and
how
they
sang
and
how
the
hours
flew
when
god
was
young
and
blithe
and
whimsical
in
the
berkshire
hills
how
can
the
village
dead
remain
so
still
surely
they
tingle
with
the
winey
air
when
the
skies
riot
and
the
sunsets
flare
and
all
the
world
becomes
a
flaming
hill
surely
the
driest
dust
must
turn
and
thrill
when
these
wild
breezes
sweep
out
all
despair
and
lakes
are
bluest
pools
are
starriest
where
the
streaming
heavens
overflow
and
spill
oh
were
it
i
that
lay
like
any
clod
though
buried
under
rock
and
gnarled
tree
i
would
arise
and
through
the
clinging
sod
go
struggling
upward
passionate
and
proud
laugh
with
the
winds
and
mountains
watching
me
and
dance
in
triumph
on
my
crumbling
shroud
voices
all
day
with
anxious
heart
and
wondering
ear
i
listened
to
the
city
heard
the
ground
echo
with
human
thunder
and
the
sound
go
reeling
down
the
streets
and
disappear
the
headlong
hours
in
their
wild
career
shouted
and
sang
until
the
world
was
drowned
with
each
one
more
profound
all
day
it
surged
but
nothing
could
i
hear
that
night
the
country
never
seemed
so
still
the
trees
and
grasses
spoke
without
a
word
to
stars
that
brushed
them
with
their
silver
wings
together
with
the
moon
i
climbed
the
hill
and
in
the
very
heart
of
silence
heard
the
speech
and
music
of
immortal
things
revelation
september
and
an
afternoon
heavy
with
languid
thoughts
and
long
the
air
breathes
faintly
half
in
swoon
like
silence
trembling
after
song
the
mighty
calmness
seems
to
draw
my
spirit
through
a
painless
birth
and
now
with
eyes
that
never
saw
i
see
the
poetry
of
earth
that
group
of
old
brooding
in
peace
by
the
river
happy
with
sunlight
and
an
oriole
singing
among
them
lo
what
a
marvel
what
rapture
for
him
who
first
sung
them
that
here
in
less
space
than
a
carpenter
workshop
the
giver
has
fashioned
a
casual
wonder
greater
than
dawn
or
the
thunder
here
in
a
dozen
of
feet
he
has
blended
music
and
motion
and
color
and
form
each
in
itself
a
creation
so
splendid
that
were
it
the
world
one
beauty
warm
and
kindle
all
life
till
it
ended
birds
and
old
only
to
think
of
these
only
to
dream
of
them
here
for
an
hour
is
to
know
all
the
secrets
of
earth
for
here
is
the
world
that
god
sang
into
flower
and
bloom
at
its
birth
here
is
its
magical
uplift
and
power
its
music
and
mirth
here
the
sun
scarcely
wakes
like
a
monarch
it
takes
rest
on
the
lordliest
branches
alone
till
a
glad
tremor
shakes
every
leaf
that
is
blown
while
a
zephyr
advancing
breathes
gently
and
breaks
the
light
into
dancing
figures
with
glancing
rhythms
and
rhymes
of
their
own
yes
here
in
this
spot
in
this
edge
of
an
acre
all
of
the
world
is
the
heart
and
the
whole
of
it
here
is
a
universe
daily
the
maker
shows
here
the
sweet
and
extravagant
soul
of
it
for
the
arms
of
the
maple
have
held
in
their
cover
the
earth
and
the
sky
and
the
stars
every
one
not
the
tenderest
twig
but
has
known
like
a
lover
the
silence
the
night
and
the
sun
not
the
airiest
bird
but
has
sung
all
unknowing
the
joy
of
each
minstrel
that
carols
unheard
and
summer
green
fields
and
a
world
of
things
growing
are
brought
to
this
spot
by
the
breath
of
a
bird
and
there
never
a
wind
but
brings
and
ranches
forests
and
tales
of
the
and
free
and
the
rush
of
the
breeze
as
it
sings
in
the
branches
echoes
and
answers
the
rush
of
the
sea
a
group
of
old
brooding
in
peace
by
the
river
that
and
a
bird
nothing
else
but
above
and
around
it
the
spell
of
the
infinite
beauty
forever
lies
like
a
secret
of
god
and
here
i
have
found
it
the
hymn
of
the
cosmic
the
anthem
that
has
for
its
choir
stars
rivers
and
flowers
still
rises
and
sweeps
me
along
while
the
cry
of
the
oriole
melts
in
a
sunset
of
fire
and
the
heavens
a
jubilant
chorus
are
flushed
with
the
fires
of
song
affirmation
as
long
as
vigorous
discontent
goads
us
from
torpid
ease
or
worse
i
thank
the
power
that
sent
struggle
the
savior
of
the
universe
as
long
as
things
are
torn
and
hurled
in
this
implacable
unrest
i
shall
embrace
the
world
with
joyful
fierceness
and
undying
zest
i
shall
grow
strong
with
every
hurt
the
scorn
the
anger
will
achieve
only
a
glad
alert
desire
to
question
boldly
and
believe
my
eager
faith
shall
keep
me
set
against
despair
or
careless
hate
knowing
this
smoke
and
sweat
is
forging
something
violent
and
great
on
a
bicycle
the
rolling
earth
stops
as
i
climb
to
the
summit
then
like
a
plummet
it
suddenly
drops
down
down
i
go
past
rippling
acres
hillsides
like
breakers
over
me
flow
wildly
alive
i
hail
the
green
shimmer
fresh
as
a
swimmer
after
the
dive
like
banners
unfurled
the
skies
dip
and
flourish
the
keen
breezes
nourish
while
the
bright
world
is
a
ribbon
unrolled
with
a
border
of
grasses
and
tansies
are
masses
and
splotches
of
gold
still
i
whirl
on
startled
a
sparrow
darts
from
the
yarrow
flash
and
is
gone
faster
the
gleams
die
as
they
dazzle
and
roadsides
of
basil
turn
to
pink
streams
sharp
as
a
knife
is
each
perfume
and
color
to
feel
nothing
duller
god
that
were
life
midnight
by
the
open
window
how
rapt
the
sleeping
stillness
of
the
night
incomparably
close
and
vast
one
might
hear
the
tense
silence
in
the
little
street
reaching
to
heaven
where
it
swells
and
breaks
into
and
that
makes
my
senses
bend
and
sway
as
waving
wheat
trembles
before
the
wind
majestic
feet
trembles
with
happy
fear
and
numb
delight
how
sharp
the
silence
like
a
sword
to
smite
brittle
security
and
iron
aches
a
soundless
and
imperative
blast
that
wakes
undreamed
of
powers
terrible
and
sweet
while
god
comes
down
roused
to
the
jubilant
fight
roused
from
the
sleepy
comfort
of
his
seat
the
wine
of
night
come
drink
the
mystic
wine
of
night
brimming
with
silence
and
the
stars
while
earth
bathed
in
this
holy
light
is
seen
without
its
scars
drink
in
the
daring
and
the
dews
the
calm
winds
and
the
restless
gleam
this
is
the
draught
that
beauty
brews
drink
it
is
the
dream
drink
oh
my
soul
and
do
not
yield
these
solitudes
this
air
shall
strengthen
thee
shall
be
thy
shield
against
a
world
despair
oh
quaff
this
of
stars
trembling
with
hope
and
high
desire
then
back
into
the
hopeless
wars
with
faith
and
fire
interludes
my
my
lute
i
would
turn
from
your
militant
measures
well
have
you
answered
the
touch
of
intransigent
fingers
wildly
your
strings
have
vibrated
but
have
you
forgotten
how
to
make
you
are
hot
to
the
hand
you
are
tense
and
exultant
cease
crying
out
let
me
rest
from
the
din
and
the
battle
life
is
not
only
a
summoning
shout
and
a
struggle
a
blow
and
a
there
not
vigorous
peace
after
vigorous
onslaught
beauty
a
challenge
as
fierce
and
as
stirring
as
conflict
look
how
she
runs
through
the
tremulous
twilight
to
meet
me
do
you
remember
it
is
night
and
she
turns
to
my
arms
of
a
sudden
soft
as
a
mother
and
wild
with
the
fires
of
april
bashful
and
bold
with
her
passionate
hair
all
about
her
lovely
and
it
was
she
who
awoke
and
impelled
us
to
singing
ah
those
first
lyrics
impulsive
and
feeble
and
earnest
she
who
aroused
us
and
soothed
us
our
passion
our
pillow
dare
you
forget
her
remember
is
she
keeps
me
rested
and
restless
only
remember
my
heart
like
a
fate
in
strong
breezes
leaps
at
the
thought
of
her
voice
and
her
slow
searching
kisses
stabbing
and
feuerzauber
i
never
knew
the
earth
had
so
much
gold
the
fields
run
over
with
it
and
this
hill
hoary
and
old
is
young
with
buoyant
blooms
that
flame
and
thrill
such
golden
fires
such
yellows
lo
how
good
this
spendthrift
world
and
what
a
lavish
god
this
fringe
of
wood
blazing
with
buttercup
and
goldenrod
you
too
beloved
are
changed
again
i
see
your
face
grow
mystical
as
on
that
night
you
turned
to
me
and
all
the
trembling
world
and
you
were
white
aye
you
are
touched
your
singing
lips
grow
dumb
the
fields
absorb
you
color
you
entire
and
you
become
a
goddess
standing
in
a
world
of
fire
sunday
night
tossing
throughout
this
tense
and
nervous
night
sleepless
i
drowse
my
soul
for
lack
of
rest
sinks
like
a
bird
that
after
flight
on
flight
misses
the
shelter
of
its
nest
so
would
i
gain
your
side
and
seek
my
love
the
comfortable
heaven
of
your
breast
once
more
to
lie
beside
the
window
seat
and
see
far
off
the
ribboned
the
yellow
in
the
dusky
street
and
pressing
close
from
proud
and
alien
heights
the
noble
skies
and
the
inviolate
stars
surround
and
bless
us
these
autumnal
nights
no
words
the
silence
and
your
breathless
name
are
all
that
in
the
world
and
faint
and
fair
the
distant
solemnly
proclaim
to
all
the
meek
and
air
i
take
you
in
my
arms
and
i
awake
groping
with
restless
anger
for
a
prayer
at
kennebunkport
we
sat
together
at
the
ocean
edge
the
night
was
mystical
and
warm
from
every
rambling
roadside
hedge
wild
roses
followed
us
with
a
swarm
of
scents
the
pines
and
every
odorous
tree
triumphed
and
rose
above
the
languid
sea
the
stars
were
dim
the
world
was
hushed
as
though
before
a
shrine
we
sat
together
at
the
ocean
rim
your
hand
in
mine
then
came
the
moon
a
calm
benignant
moon
like
some
indulgent
mother
that
has
smiled
on
every
wayward
child
the
breathing
stillness
like
a
wordless
croon
made
the
soft
heart
of
heaven
doubly
mild
and
the
salt
air
mingled
with
the
air
of
june
the
vast
and
intimate
silence
and
your
lips
faintly
we
saw
the
lanterns
of
three
ships
three
swaying
sparks
of
sudden
red
and
green
we
spoke
no
word
we
heard
unseen
a
wearily
flapping
and
nothing
murmured
in
that
world
of
wonder
only
the
hushing
waters
gentle
lapping
a
distant
trembling
as
of
ghostly
thunder
then
poignantly
and
plain
the
lonely
whistle
of
a
weary
train
and
once
again
the
silence
and
your
lips
oh
let
me
never
cease
to
thank
you
for
that
night
that
night
that
eased
and
fortified
my
heart
when
radiant
peace
dearer
than
all
delight
bathed
every
old
and
feverish
smart
wiped
out
all
memories
of
the
uncleanly
fight
cradled
in
that
great
beauty
and
your
arms
the
cries
and
mad
alarms
were
lulled
and
all
the
bitter
banners
furled
the
tumult
vanished
and
the
thought
thereof
in
you
i
knew
the
sweet
contentment
of
the
world
the
balm
of
silence
and
the
strength
of
love
in
a
strange
city
dusk
and
a
hunger
for
your
face
that
grows
with
brooding
twilight
deeper
while
in
this
hushed
and
cheerless
place
the
world
lies
like
a
careless
sleeper
oh
for
a
brave
red
wave
of
sound
to
send
life
flowing
somehow
through
me
oh
for
the
blatant
human
round
to
end
these
hours
lone
and
gloomy
at
last
the
friendly
summer
night
and
children
voices
calling
after
long
avenues
sing
out
with
light
murmurs
arise
and
bursts
of
laughter
i
hear
the
lisp
of
happy
feet
life
goes
by
like
a
rushing
river
a
boy
comes
whistling
up
the
street
and
i
am
lonelier
than
ever
back
she
came
through
the
trembling
dusk
and
her
mother
spoke
and
said
what
is
it
makes
you
late
and
why
do
you
smile
and
sing
as
gay
as
though
you
just
were
wed
mother
my
hen
that
never
had
chicks
has
hatched
out
six
back
she
came
through
the
flaming
dusk
and
her
mother
spoke
and
said
what
gives
your
eyes
that
dancing
light
what
makes
your
lips
so
strangely
bright
and
why
are
your
cheeks
so
red
mother
the
berries
i
ate
in
the
lane
have
left
a
back
she
came
through
the
faltering
dusk
and
her
mother
spoke
and
said
you
are
weeping
your
footstep
is
heavy
with
care
what
makes
you
totter
and
cling
to
the
stair
and
why
do
you
hang
your
head
mother
oh
mother
you
never
can
know
i
loved
him
so
in
the
streets
boy
my
boy
it
is
lonely
in
the
city
days
that
have
no
pity
and
the
nights
without
a
tear
follow
all
too
slowly
and
i
can
no
more
dissemble
i
am
frightened
and
i
tremble
and
i
would
that
you
were
here
oh
boy
god
keep
you
boy
my
boy
i
had
sworn
to
weep
no
longer
time
i
thought
was
stronger
than
the
evenings
long
gone
by
the
ardent
looks
the
eager
hands
the
whispers
hot
and
hurried
but
they
all
come
back
unburied
and
not
one
of
them
will
die
oh
boy
god
save
you
boy
my
boy
you
were
bold
with
youth
and
power
your
love
was
like
a
flower
that
you
wore
upon
your
sleeve
and
wherever
you
may
go
there
be
a
girl
with
eyes
that
glisten
a
girl
to
watch
and
listen
and
a
girl
for
you
to
leave
oh
boy
god
help
her
envy
the
willow
and
the
river
ripple
with
silver
speech
and
one
refrain
forever
they
murmur
each
to
each
brook
with
the
silver
gravel
would
that
your
lot
were
mine
to
wander
free
to
travel
where
greener
valleys
shine
strange
ventures
fresh
revealings
and
at
the
end
the
sea
brook
with
your
turns
and
wheelings
how
rich
your
life
must
be
tree
with
the
golden
rustling
would
that
i
were
so
blessed
to
cease
this
stumbling
jostling
this
feverish
unrest
i
join
the
ocean
riot
you
stand
and
free
tree
with
your
peace
and
quiet
how
rich
your
life
must
be
willow
and
the
river
ripple
with
silver
speech
and
one
refrain
forever
they
murmur
each
to
a
birthday
again
i
come
with
my
handful
of
song
with
my
trumpery
gift
tricked
out
and
made
showy
with
rhyme
it
is
spring
and
the
time
when
your
thoughts
are
long
when
the
blossoming
world
in
its
confident
prime
whispers
and
wakens
imperative
dreams
when
you
color
and
start
with
the
airiest
schemes
and
the
laughter
of
children
is
stirring
your
heart
with
all
of
these
voices
that
rise
to
restore
you
to
gladness
again
with
your
heart
full
of
things
that
sing
and
adore
you
i
come
with
my
strain
i
come
with
my
tinkling
that
patters
like
rain
on
a
rickety
pane
with
a
jingle
of
words
and
old
tunes
which
have
long
done
duty
in
song
spreading
my
verse
like
a
showman
before
you
and
you
turn
to
the
world
as
you
turn
to
the
bosom
that
bore
you
in
all
this
singing
at
your
heart
in
all
this
ringing
through
the
day
in
the
bravado
of
the
may
i
have
no
part
for
i
am
not
one
with
the
conquering
year
that
wakes
without
fear
the
lyrical
souls
of
the
feathery
throng
that
flames
in
the
heavens
when
evenings
are
long
that
surges
with
power
and
urges
with
cheer
the
boldness
of
love
the
laugh
of
the
strong
and
the
confident
song
i
am
no
longer
the
masterful
lover
storming
my
way
to
the
shrine
of
your
heart
reckless
with
youth
and
the
zest
to
discover
all
that
the
world
sets
apart
i
am
no
longer
wiser
and
stronger
no
longer
i
shout
in
the
face
of
the
world
no
longer
my
challenge
is
sounded
and
hurled
with
such
fury
that
even
the
heavens
must
hear
it
no
longer
i
mount
on
a
passionate
flood
something
has
changed
my
arrogant
spirit
something
has
left
my
braggart
blood
something
has
left
me
something
has
entered
in
something
i
knew
not
something
beyond
my
desire
deeper
and
gentler
i
hold
you
all
that
has
been
seems
like
a
spark
that
is
lost
in
a
forest
of
fire
minor
my
song
is
for
still
the
old
memories
burn
only
in
you
and
your
thought
do
i
find
my
release
i
have
done
with
the
blustering
airs
and
i
turn
from
the
clamorous
strife
to
the
greater
heroics
of
peace
me
again
out
of
the
cries
and
alarms
all
of
the
tumult
is
vain
here
in
your
hold
me
again
oft
have
we
wandered
apart
now
it
is
all
made
plain
here
in
your
heart
heal
me
again
cleanse
me
with
tears
that
remove
pain
and
the
ruins
of
pain
here
in
your
love
minor
my
song
was
abashed
i
must
lower
my
voice
something
has
touched
me
with
nobler
and
holier
fire
something
that
thrills
as
when
trumpets
and
children
rejoice
something
i
knew
not
something
beyond
my
desire
minor
no
longer
the
sighing
and
droning
depart
in
a
chorus
of
triumph
the
jubilant
spirits
increase
shelter
and
spur
me
forever
in
the
merciful
strength
of
your
heart
you
who
have
soothed
me
with
passion
and
roused
me
with
passionate
peace
leaving
the
harbor
at
last
the
great
red
sun
sank
low
an
evil
eye
and
cooling
airs
sprang
up
to
blow
the
sea
that
challenged
glow
for
glow
the
angry
face
of
the
sky
still
burned
the
streets
we
had
left
behind
where
tortured
and
broken
down
the
millions
scarcely
hoped
to
find
a
moment
escape
from
the
maddening
grind
in
the
terrible
furnace
of
town
and
blotting
out
cities
the
twilight
fell
with
a
single
star
at
seven
the
sea
grew
wider
beneath
the
spell
and
the
moon
like
a
broken
silver
shell
lay
on
the
shore
of
heaven
the
shell
to
the
pearl
grow
not
so
fast
glow
not
so
warm
thy
hidden
fires
burn
too
wild
too
perfect
is
thy
rounded
form
cling
close
my
child
be
yet
my
babe
rest
quiet
when
the
great
beat
and
call
too
soon
wilt
thou
be
ripe
for
men
the
world
and
all
thy
shining
skin
thy
silken
sheath
these
will
undo
thee
all
too
soon
and
men
will
fight
for
thee
beneath
some
paler
moon
aye
thou
my
own
my
undefiled
shalt
make
the
lewd
world
dream
and
start
when
they
have
seized
and
torn
thee
child
out
of
my
heart
with
velvets
shall
thy
bed
be
laid
a
royal
captive
thou
shalt
be
and
oh
what
prices
will
be
paid
to
ransom
thee
thy
path
shall
be
a
track
of
gold
of
lust
of
death
and
countless
crimes
bought
by
a
sensual
world
and
sold
a
thousand
times
and
each
shall
lose
thee
at
the
last
hating
yet
still
desiring
thee
while
i
lie
where
i
have
been
cast
back
in
the
sea
so
wait
and
lest
the
world
transform
thy
soul
and
make
thee
not
so
fast
glow
not
so
warm
cling
close
my
the
young
mystic
we
sat
together
close
and
warm
my
little
tired
boy
and
i
watching
across
the
evening
sky
the
coming
of
the
storm
no
rumblings
rose
no
thunders
crashed
the
scarcely
sang
aloud
but
from
a
huge
and
solid
cloud
the
summer
lightnings
flashed
and
then
he
whispered
father
watch
i
think
god
going
to
light
his
moon
and
when
my
boy
oh
very
soon
i
saw
him
strike
a
match
healed
the
winds
like
a
pack
of
hounds
snap
at
my
dragging
heels
with
sudden
leapings
and
playful
bounds
they
urge
me
out
to
the
greener
grounds
where
the
butterfly
sinks
and
the
swallow
reels
giddy
with
spring
with
its
smells
and
sounds
and
i
go
for
of
late
i
have
fretted
and
sulked
and
clung
to
my
books
and
the
house
lethargic
with
winter
fancies
and
dulled
with
a
torpid
mood
but
now
i
am
called
by
the
grasses
the
rumor
of
blossoming
boughs
the
hints
of
a
thousand
singers
and
the
ancient
thrill
of
the
wood
for
the
streets
run
over
with
sunlight
and
spill
a
glory
on
bricks
and
the
dustiest
sill
and
life
like
a
great
drum
pulses
and
pounds
i
follow
the
world
and
i
follow
my
will
and
i
go
to
see
what
the
park
reveals
when
the
winds
like
a
pack
of
buoyant
hounds
snap
at
my
dragging
heels
once
with
the
green
again
how
i
am
changed
lo
i
have
seen
again
friends
long
estranged
once
more
the
lyrical
and
river
once
more
the
miracle
greater
than
ever
where
is
there
dulness
now
rich
with
new
urges
life
in
its
fullness
now
surges
and
purges
all
that
is
brash
in
me
sunlight
and
song
these
things
will
fashion
me
splendid
and
strong
splendid
and
strong
i
shall
grow
once
again
joyful
and
clean
as
the
mind
of
a
child
as
tears
after
pain
or
hearts
reconciled
as
woods
washed
with
rain
as
love
in
the
wild
or
that
bird
to
whom
all
things
but
singing
is
vain
bird
there
were
songs
in
your
heart
just
as
rapturous
as
these
that
you
bring
why
when
we
longed
for
your
magic
to
capture
us
did
you
not
sing
now
with
the
world
making
music
we
heed
you
not
coward
for
all
your
fine
challenge
we
need
you
not
we
too
are
brave
with
the
spring
so
i
sang
but
a
something
was
missing
the
song
and
the
sunlight
were
stale
though
a
squirrel
had
sat
on
my
shoulder
and
sparrows
had
fed
from
my
hand
though
i
heard
the
white
laughter
of
ripples
and
the
faint
answering
hail
and
somewhere
a
bird
voice
i
knew
not
yet
hearing
could
half
understand
and
lo
at
my
doorstep
i
saw
it
it
shouted
to
me
as
i
came
it
laughed
in
its
simple
revealment
a
miracle
common
and
wild
plainly
i
heard
and
beheld
it
bright
as
a
forest
of
flame
and
its
face
was
the
face
of
a
mother
and
its
voice
was
the
voice
of
a
child
the
your
eyes
and
a
thousand
stars
leap
from
the
night
to
aid
me
i
scale
the
impossible
bars
i
laugh
at
a
world
that
dismayed
me
your
voice
and
the
thundering
skies
tremble
and
cease
to
appall
me
coward
no
longer
i
rise
spurred
for
what
battles
may
call
me
your
arms
and
my
purpose
grows
strong
your
lips
and
high
passions
complete
me
for
your
love
it
is
armor
and
song
and
where
is
the
thing
to
defeat
me
spring
on
broadway
make
way
for
spring
spring
that
a
stranger
in
the
city
spring
that
a
truant
in
the
town
make
way
for
spring
for
she
has
no
pity
and
she
will
tear
your
barriers
down
make
way
for
spring
see
from
her
hidden
valleys
with
mirth
that
never
palls
she
comes
with
songs
and
sallies
with
bells
and
magic
calls
and
dances
down
your
alleys
and
whispers
through
your
walls
you
who
never
once
have
missed
her
in
your
town
of
pomp
and
pride
now
in
vain
you
will
resist
her
you
will
feel
her
at
your
side
even
in
the
smallest
street
even
in
the
densest
throng
she
will
follow
at
your
feet
she
will
walk
with
you
along
she
will
stop
you
as
you
start
here
and
there
and
growing
bolder
she
will
touch
you
on
the
shoulder
she
will
clutch
you
at
the
heart
merchant
you
who
drink
your
mead
from
a
golden
cup
shut
your
ears
and
do
not
heed
look
not
up
beware
for
she
is
light
as
air
and
her
charm
will
work
confusion
spring
is
but
an
old
delusion
and
a
snare
merchant
you
who
drink
your
mead
while
the
thirsty
die
shut
your
eyes
and
do
not
heed
pass
her
by
maiden
with
the
eyes
do
not
pause
to
greet
her
spring
is
far
too
wild
and
wise
do
not
meet
her
do
not
listen
while
she
tells
her
persuasive
lures
and
spells
do
not
learn
her
secrets
lest
she
should
plant
them
in
your
breast
whisper
things
to
shame
and
shock
you
make
your
heart
beat
fast
and
mock
you
send
you
dreams
that
rob
your
rest
maiden
with
the
eyes
spring
is
far
too
wild
and
wise
and
you
my
friend
with
hasty
stride
think
you
to
escape
her
ah
like
fire
touching
paper
she
will
burn
into
your
side
she
will
rouse
you
once
again
she
will
sway
you
till
you
follow
like
the
smallest
singing
swallow
in
her
train
put
irons
on
your
feet
my
friend
and
chain
your
soul
with
golden
weights
lest
she
should
move
you
in
the
end
and
lead
you
past
the
city
gates
and
make
you
frolic
with
the
wind
and
play
a
thousand
godlike
parts
and
sing
until
within
you
starts
a
pity
for
the
senseless
blind
the
deaf
the
dumb
and
all
their
kind
whose
eager
aimless
footsteps
wind
forever
to
the
frantic
marts
through
every
mad
and
breathless
my
friend
put
irons
on
your
feet
so
and
that
is
right
my
friend
do
not
yield
send
her
on
her
way
and
end
all
her
follies
let
her
spend
her
reckless
days
and
nights
concealed
in
wood
and
field
the
paths
beyond
the
town
are
clear
these
skies
are
wan
bid
her
begone
what
is
she
doing
here
what
is
she
doing
here
and
why
the
city
is
no
place
for
spring
what
can
she
have
what
can
she
bring
that
you
would
care
to
buy
her
songs
alas
you
do
not
sing
her
smiles
you
have
no
time
to
try
her
wings
you
do
not
care
to
fly
spring
has
not
fashioned
anything
to
tempt
your
jaded
eye
the
city
is
no
place
for
her
it
is
too
violent
and
shrill
too
full
of
graver
things
but
still
beneath
the
throbbing
surge
and
stir
her
spirit
lives
and
moves
until
even
the
dullest
feel
the
spur
of
an
awakened
will
make
way
then
life
rejoicing
calls
with
a
lyric
rout
till
in
this
mighty
voicing
the
very
stones
sing
out
till
nowhere
is
a
single
sleeping
or
silent
thing
and
worlds
that
meet
and
mingle
fairly
tingle
with
the
spring
make
way
for
her
for
the
fervor
of
life
for
the
passions
that
stir
for
the
courage
of
strife
for
the
struggles
that
bring
a
more
vivid
day
make
way
for
spring
make
way
in
a
cab
rain
and
the
lights
of
the
city
blurred
by
the
mist
on
the
pane
a
thing
without
passion
or
pity
this
is
the
rain
it
beats
on
the
roof
with
derision
it
howls
at
the
doors
of
the
cab
phantoms
go
by
in
a
vision
distorted
and
drab
torpor
and
dreariness
greet
me
all
of
the
things
i
abhor
rise
to
confront
and
defeat
me
as
i
ride
to
your
door
at
last
you
have
come
you
have
banished
the
gloom
of
each
street
the
tawdry
surroundings
have
vanished
the
evening
is
sweet
now
the
whole
city
is
dreamlike
the
rain
plays
the
lightest
of
tunes
the
lamps
through
the
mist
make
it
seem
like
a
city
of
moons
no
longer
my
fancies
run
riot
i
hold
the
most
magic
of
charms
you
smile
at
me
warm
and
unquiet
here
in
my
arms
i
do
not
wonder
or
witness
whether
it
rains
or
is
fair
i
only
can
think
of
your
sweetness
and
the
scent
of
your
hair
i
am
deaf
to
the
clatter
and
drumming
and
life
is
a
thing
to
ignore
alas
my
beloved
we
are
coming
once
more
to
your
door
you
have
gone
it
is
listless
and
lonely
the
evening
is
empty
again
the
world
is
a
blank
there
is
only
the
desolate
rain
summer
night
broadway
night
is
the
city
disease
the
streets
and
the
people
one
sees
glow
with
a
light
that
is
strangely
inhuman
a
fever
that
never
grows
cold
heaven
completes
the
disgrace
for
now
with
her
face
night
has
the
leer
of
a
dissolute
woman
cynical
and
old
and
i
think
of
the
country
roads
of
the
quiet
sleeping
abodes
where
every
tree
is
a
silent
brother
and
the
hearth
is
a
thing
to
cling
to
and
i
sicken
and
long
for
it
now
to
feel
clean
winds
on
my
brow
where
night
bends
low
like
an
mother
looking
for
children
to
sing
to
haunted
between
the
moss
and
stone
the
lonely
lilies
rise
wasted
and
overgrown
the
tangled
garden
lies
weeds
climb
about
the
stoop
and
clutch
the
crumbling
walls
the
drowsy
grasses
droop
the
night
wind
falls
the
place
is
like
a
wood
no
sign
is
there
to
tell
where
rose
and
iris
stood
that
once
she
loved
so
well
where
phlox
and
asters
grew
a
leafless
thornbush
stands
and
shrubs
that
never
knew
her
tender
hands
over
the
broken
fence
the
moonbeams
trail
their
shrouds
their
tattered
cerements
cling
to
the
gauzy
clouds
in
ribbons
frayed
and
thin
and
startled
by
the
light
silence
shrinks
deeper
in
the
depths
of
night
useless
lie
spades
and
rakes
rust
on
the
yet
where
the
moonlight
makes
nebulous
silver
pools
a
ghostly
shape
is
cast
something
unseen
has
stirred
was
it
a
breeze
that
passed
was
it
a
bird
dead
roses
lift
their
heads
out
of
a
grassy
tomb
from
ruined
a
thousand
pansies
bloom
the
gate
is
opened
wide
the
garden
that
has
been
now
blossoms
like
a
bride
entered
in
isadora
duncan
dancing
iphigenia
in
aulis
fling
the
stones
and
let
them
all
lie
take
a
breath
and
toss
the
ball
high
and
before
it
strikes
the
floor
of
the
hoar
and
aged
shore
sweep
them
up
though
there
should
be
even
more
than
two
or
three
add
a
pebble
then
once
more
fling
the
stones
and
let
them
all
lie
take
a
breath
and
toss
the
ball
high
rises
now
the
sound
of
ancient
chants
and
the
circling
figure
moves
more
slowly
thus
the
stately
gods
themselves
must
dance
while
the
world
grows
rapturous
and
holy
thus
the
gods
might
weave
a
great
romance
singing
to
the
sighs
of
flute
and
psalter
till
the
last
of
all
the
many
chants
and
the
priestess
sinks
before
the
altar
cease
oh
cease
the
murmured
singing
hush
the
numbers
brave
or
blithe
for
she
enters
gravely
swinging
lowering
and
lithe
dark
and
vengeful
as
the
ringing
scythe
meets
scythe
while
the
flame
is
fiercely
sweeping
all
her
virgin
airs
depart
she
is
without
smiles
and
weeping
or
a
maiden
art
stern
and
savage
as
the
leaping
heart
meets
heart
now
the
tune
grows
frantic
now
the
torches
flare
wild
and
corybantic
echoes
fill
the
air
with
a
sudden
sally
all
the
voices
shout
and
the
bacchic
rally
turns
into
a
rout
here
is
life
that
surges
through
each
burning
vein
here
is
joy
that
purges
every
creeping
pain
even
sober
sadness
casts
aside
her
pall
till
with
buoyant
madness
she
must
swoon
and
fall
chopin
faint
preludings
on
a
flute
and
she
swims
before
us
shadows
follow
in
pursuit
like
a
phantom
chorus
sense
and
sound
are
intertwined
through
her
necromancy
till
our
dreaming
souls
are
blind
to
all
things
but
fancy
haunted
woods
and
perfumed
nights
swift
and
soft
desires
roses
lights
and
the
sound
of
lyres
vague
chromatics
on
a
flute
all
are
subtly
blended
till
the
instrument
grows
mute
and
the
dance
is
ended
songs
and
the
poet
sara
sing
of
the
rose
or
of
the
mire
sing
strife
or
rising
moons
the
silence
or
the
throng
poet
it
matters
not
if
life
is
in
the
song
if
life
rekindles
it
and
if
the
rhymes
bear
beauty
as
their
eloquent
refrain
though
it
were
sung
a
thousand
times
sing
it
again
thrill
us
with
song
let
others
preach
or
rage
make
us
so
thirst
for
beauty
that
we
cease
these
struggles
and
this
strident
age
grows
sweet
with
peace
the
heretic
blasphemy
i
do
not
envy
god
there
is
no
thing
in
all
the
skies
or
under
to
startle
and
awaken
him
to
wonder
no
marvel
can
appear
to
stir
his
placid
soul
with
terrible
thunder
he
was
not
born
with
awe
nor
blessed
with
fear
i
do
not
envy
god
he
is
not
burned
with
spring
and
april
madness
the
rush
of
life
its
rash
impetuous
gladness
he
can
not
hope
to
know
he
can
not
feel
the
fever
and
the
sadness
the
leaping
fire
the
insupportable
glow
i
do
not
envy
god
forever
he
must
watch
the
planets
crawling
to
flaming
goals
where
sun
and
star
are
falling
he
can
not
wander
free
for
he
must
face
through
centuries
appalling
a
vast
and
infinite
monotony
i
do
not
envy
god
he
can
not
die
he
dare
not
even
slumber
though
he
be
god
and
free
from
care
and
cumber
i
would
not
share
his
place
for
he
must
live
when
years
have
lost
their
number
and
time
sinks
crumbling
into
shattered
space
i
do
not
envy
god
nay
more
i
pity
him
his
lonely
heaven
i
pity
him
each
lonely
morn
and
even
his
splendid
lonely
throne
for
he
must
sit
and
wait
till
all
is
riven
alone
through
all
eternity
alone
ii
irony
why
are
the
things
that
have
no
death
the
ones
with
neither
sight
nor
breath
eternity
is
thrust
upon
a
bit
of
earth
a
senseless
stone
a
grain
of
dust
a
casual
clod
receives
the
greatest
gift
of
god
a
pebble
in
the
roadway
lies
it
never
dies
the
grass
our
fathers
cut
away
is
growing
on
their
graves
the
tiniest
brooks
that
scarcely
flow
eternally
will
come
and
go
there
is
no
kind
of
death
to
kill
the
sands
that
lie
so
meek
and
still
but
man
is
great
and
strong
and
wise
and
so
he
dies
iii
mockery
god
i
return
to
you
on
april
days
when
along
you
walk
with
me
and
my
faith
blossoms
like
the
earliest
tree
that
shames
the
bleak
world
with
its
yellow
sprays
my
faith
revives
when
through
a
rosy
haze
the
hills
smile
quietly
young
winds
uplift
a
bird
clean
ecstacy
for
this
oh
god
my
joyousness
and
praise
but
now
the
crowded
streets
and
choking
airs
the
huddled
thousands
bruised
and
tossed
about
these
or
the
thoroughfares
the
laughter
and
the
empty
shout
the
city
tragic
with
its
cares
for
this
oh
god
my
silence
and
my
doubt
iv
humility
oh
god
if
i
have
ever
been
so
filled
with
ignorance
and
sin
that
i
have
dared
to
use
thy
name
in
blasphemy
in
jest
in
shame
if
ever
i
have
dared
to
flout
thy
works
and
mock
thy
deeds
with
doubt
thou
must
forgive
me
as
thou
art
divine
for
god
the
fault
was
thine
as
well
as
mine
oh
i
have
used
thee
time
on
time
to
fill
a
phrase
to
round
a
rhyme
but
was
this
wrong
nay
in
thy
heart
thou
knowest
the
noble
theme
thou
art
was
it
my
fault
that
as
i
sung
the
daring
speech
was
on
my
tongue
nay
if
my
singing
god
gave
thee
offense
thou
wouldst
have
robbed
me
of
the
lyric
sense
but
dignity
hath
made
thee
dumb
and
so
thou
biddest
me
to
come
and
be
a
sonant
part
of
thee
to
sing
thy
praise
in
blasphemy
to
be
the
life
within
the
clod
that
points
the
paradox
of
god
to
chant
beneath
a
loud
and
lyric
grief
a
faith
that
flaunts
its
very
disbelief
fifth
avenue
spring
afternoon
the
world
running
over
with
color
with
whispers
strange
fervors
and
april
there
a
smell
in
the
air
as
if
meadows
were
under
our
feet
spring
smiles
at
the
commonest
waysides
but
she
pours
out
her
heart
to
the
city
as
one
woman
might
to
another
who
meet
after
years
restless
with
color
and
perfume
the
streets
are
a
riot
of
blossoms
what
garden
could
boast
of
such
flowers
not
eden
itself
primroses
pinks
and
gardenias
shame
the
gray
town
and
its
squalor
windows
are
flaming
with
jonquils
fires
of
gold
out
of
a
florist
some
pansies
peer
at
the
crowd
like
the
faces
of
solemnly
mischievous
children
going
to
bed
and
women
spring
favorite
children
frail
and
phantastically
fashioned
pass
like
a
race
of
immortals
too
radiant
for
earth
the
pale
and
the
drab
are
transfigured
they
sing
themselves
into
the
sunshine
every
girl
is
a
lyric
an
urge
and
a
lure
and
like
a
challenge
of
trumpets
the
spring
and
its
impulse
goes
through
me
breezes
and
flowers
and
people
sing
in
my
blood
breezes
and
flowers
and
people
and
under
it
all
oh
beloved
out
of
the
song
and
the
sunshine
rises
your
face
tribute
never
will
you
let
me
tire
of
leaping
passion
never
can
i
grow
weary
of
undesired
joys
the
delicate
strength
of
your
bosom
your
hands
incredible
softness
the
fluent
curve
of
your
body
the
fierceness
of
your
lips
ceaselessly
do
they
call
me
you
and
your
eloquent
beauty
are
challenge
and
invitation
too
ravishing
to
resist
always
the
burning
summons
the
sweet
imperative
madness
rides
over
me
like
a
conqueror
careless
and
confident
even
so
goes
love
trampling
and
invincible
with
rapt
and
pitiless
beauty
over
the
world
songs
of
protest
james
challenge
quiet
and
courageous
night
the
keen
vibration
of
the
stars
call
me
from
morbid
peace
to
fight
the
world
forlorn
and
desperate
air
throbs
like
a
rolling
drum
the
brave
hills
and
the
singing
sea
unrest
and
people
faces
come
like
rousing
while
life
lusty
banner
flies
i
shall
assail
with
raging
mirth
the
scornful
and
untroubled
skies
the
cold
complacency
of
caliban
in
the
coal
mines
god
we
do
like
to
complain
we
know
that
the
mine
is
no
lark
but
there
the
pools
from
the
rain
but
there
the
cold
and
the
dark
god
you
do
know
what
it
is
you
in
your
sky
watching
the
meteors
whizz
warm
with
the
sun
always
by
god
if
you
had
but
the
moon
stuck
in
your
cap
for
a
lamp
even
you
tire
of
it
soon
down
in
the
dark
and
the
damp
nothing
but
blackness
above
and
nothing
that
moves
but
the
cars
god
if
you
wish
for
our
love
fling
us
a
handful
of
stars
any
city
into
the
staring
street
she
goes
on
her
nightly
round
with
weary
and
tireless
feet
over
the
wretched
ground
a
thing
that
man
never
spurns
a
thing
that
all
men
despise
into
her
soul
there
burns
the
street
with
its
pitiless
eyes
she
needs
no
charm
or
wile
she
carries
no
beauty
or
power
but
a
tawdry
and
casual
smile
for
a
tawdry
and
casual
hour
the
street
with
its
pitiless
eyes
follows
wherever
she
lurks
but
she
is
hardened
and
wise
she
rattles
her
bracelets
and
smirks
she
goes
with
her
sordid
array
luring
without
a
lure
she
is
man
hunger
and
prey
his
lust
and
its
hideous
cure
all
that
she
knows
are
the
lies
the
evil
the
squalor
the
scars
the
street
with
its
pitiless
eyes
the
night
with
its
pitiless
stars
landscapes
clement
the
rain
was
over
and
the
brilliant
air
made
every
little
blade
of
grass
appear
vivid
and
startling
everything
was
there
with
sharpened
outlines
eloquently
clear
as
though
one
saw
it
in
a
crystal
sphere
the
rusty
sumac
with
its
struggling
spires
the
with
all
its
million
fires
a
million
torches
swinging
in
the
wind
a
single
poplar
marvellously
thinned
half
like
a
naked
boy
half
like
a
sword
clouds
like
the
haughty
banners
of
the
lord
a
group
of
pansies
with
their
shrewish
faces
little
old
ladies
cackling
over
laces
the
quaint
unhurried
road
that
curved
so
well
the
prim
petunias
with
their
rich
rank
smell
the
the
creepers
in
the
field
how
bountifully
were
they
all
revealed
how
arrogantly
each
one
seemed
to
thrive
so
frank
and
strong
so
radiantly
alive
and
over
all
the
earth
there
seemed
to
spread
a
sharp
and
kindling
mirth
piercing
the
stubborn
stones
until
i
saw
the
toad
face
heaven
without
shame
or
awe
the
ant
confront
the
stars
and
every
weed
grow
proud
as
though
it
bore
a
royal
seed
while
all
the
things
that
die
and
decompose
sent
forth
their
bloom
as
richly
as
the
rose
oh
what
a
liberal
power
that
made
them
thrive
and
keep
the
very
dirt
that
died
alive
and
now
i
saw
the
slender
no
longer
calm
or
drooping
listlessly
letting
its
languid
branches
sway
and
fall
as
though
it
danced
in
some
sad
ritual
but
rather
like
a
young
athletic
girl
fearless
and
gay
her
hair
all
out
of
curl
and
flying
in
the
wind
her
head
thrown
back
her
arms
flung
up
her
garments
flowing
slack
and
all
her
rushing
spirits
running
over
what
made
a
sober
tree
seem
such
a
rover
or
made
the
staid
and
stalwart
that
stood
for
years
in
velvet
peace
turn
all
their
fruit
to
little
worlds
of
flame
and
burn
the
trembling
orchard
there
below
what
lit
the
heart
of
every
oh
why
was
nothing
weary
dull
or
tame
beauty
it
was
and
keen
compassionate
mirth
that
drives
the
vast
and
energetic
earth
and
with
abrupt
and
visionary
eyes
i
saw
the
huddled
tenements
arise
here
where
the
merry
clover
danced
and
shone
sprang
agonies
of
iron
and
of
stone
there
where
green
silence
laughed
or
stood
enthralled
cheap
music
blared
and
evil
alleys
sprawled
the
roaring
avenues
the
shrieking
mills
brothels
and
prisons
on
those
kindly
hills
the
menace
of
these
things
swept
over
me
a
threatening
unconquerable
sea
a
stirring
landscape
and
a
generous
earth
freshening
courage
and
benevolent
mirth
and
then
the
city
like
a
hideous
sore
god
and
what
is
all
this
beauty
for
two
funerals
i
upon
a
field
of
shrieking
red
a
mighty
general
stormed
and
fell
they
raised
him
from
the
common
dead
and
all
the
people
mourned
him
well
swiftly
they
cried
let
honors
come
and
glory
with
her
deathless
bays
for
him
let
every
muffled
drum
and
grieving
bugle
thrill
with
praise
has
he
not
made
the
whole
world
fear
the
very
lifting
of
his
sword
has
he
not
slain
his
thousands
here
to
glorify
the
law
and
lord
then
make
his
bed
of
sacred
sod
to
greater
deeds
no
man
can
win
each
amused
and
ancient
god
began
to
ii
facing
a
cold
and
sneering
sky
cold
as
the
sneering
hearts
of
men
a
man
began
to
prophesy
to
speak
of
love
and
faith
again
boldly
he
spoke
and
bravely
dared
the
savage
jest
the
kindlier
stone
the
armies
mocked
at
him
he
fared
to
battle
gaily
and
alone
alone
he
fought
alone
to
move
a
world
whose
wars
would
never
cease
and
all
his
blows
were
struck
for
love
and
all
his
fighting
was
for
peace
they
tortured
him
with
thorns
and
rods
they
hanged
him
on
a
frowning
hill
all
the
old
and
heartless
gods
are
laughing
sunday
it
was
sunday
eleven
in
the
morning
people
were
at
church
prayers
were
in
the
making
god
was
near
at
hand
down
the
cramped
and
narrow
streets
of
quiet
lawrence
came
the
tramp
of
workers
marching
in
their
hundreds
marching
in
the
morning
marching
to
the
where
no
longer
fiery
underneath
the
grasses
callous
and
uncaring
lay
their
friend
and
sister
in
their
hands
they
carried
wreaths
and
drooping
flowers
overhead
their
banners
dipped
and
soared
like
eagles
aye
but
eagles
bleeding
stained
with
their
own
red
but
not
for
glory
red
with
wounds
and
travail
red
the
buoyant
symbol
of
the
blood
of
all
the
world
so
they
bore
their
banners
singing
toward
the
so
they
marched
and
chanted
mingling
tears
and
tributes
so
with
flowers
the
dying
went
to
deck
the
dead
within
the
churches
people
heard
the
sound
and
much
concern
was
theirs
god
might
not
hear
the
sacred
word
god
might
not
hear
their
prayers
such
things
be
allowed
these
slaves
to
vex
the
sabbath
peace
with
song
to
come
with
chants
like
marching
waves
that
proudly
swept
along
god
turned
to
these
and
heard
suppose
he
listened
unawares
god
might
forget
the
sacred
word
god
might
forget
their
prayers
and
so
oh
tragic
irony
the
guardians
of
the
peace
were
sent
to
sweep
them
back
to
see
the
ribald
song
should
cease
to
scatter
those
who
came
and
vexed
god
with
their
troubled
cries
and
cares
quiet
so
god
might
hear
the
text
the
sleek
and
unctuous
prayers
up
the
rapt
and
singing
streets
of
little
lawrence
came
the
stolid
soldiers
and
behind
the
grinning
and
invisible
bearing
unseen
torches
rode
red
hordes
of
anger
sweeping
all
before
them
lust
and
evil
joined
them
terror
rode
among
them
fury
fired
its
pistols
madness
stabbed
and
yelled
through
the
wild
and
bleeding
streets
of
shuddering
lawrence
raged
the
heedless
panic
and
bitter
passion
tore
and
trampled
men
once
mild
and
peaceful
fought
with
savage
hatred
in
the
name
of
law
and
order
and
below
the
outcry
like
the
sea
beneath
the
breakers
mingling
with
the
anguish
rolled
the
solemn
organ
eleven
in
the
morning
people
were
at
church
prayers
were
in
the
making
god
was
near
at
hand
it
was
sunday
strikers
in
the
mud
and
scum
of
things
underneath
the
whole
world
blot
something
they
tell
us
always
sings
do
we
hear
it
not
in
the
heart
of
things
unclean
somewhere
in
the
furious
fight
the
face
of
god
is
plainly
seen
has
destroyed
our
sight
yet
have
we
heard
enough
to
feel
yet
have
we
seen
enough
to
know
who
bound
us
to
the
awful
wheel
whose
hands
have
brought
us
low
and
we
shall
cry
out
till
the
wind
roars
in
their
ears
the
thing
to
come
though
they
made
us
deaf
and
blind
nothing
shall
keep
us
dumb
in
the
subway
chaos
is
tamed
and
ordered
as
we
ride
the
rock
is
rent
the
darkness
flung
aside
and
all
the
horrors
of
the
deep
defied
a
coil
of
wires
a
throb
a
sudden
spark
and
on
a
screaming
meteor
we
embark
that
hurls
us
past
the
cold
and
breathless
dark
the
centuries
disclose
their
secret
graves
riding
in
splendor
through
a
world
of
waves
the
ancient
elements
become
our
slaves
uncanny
fancies
whisper
to
and
fro
terror
and
night
surround
us
here
below
and
through
the
house
of
death
we
come
and
go
and
here
oh

praise
him
all
creatures
here
below
every
morning
mercies
new
fall
as
fresh
as
morning
yet
we
are
choked
with
sin
with
bestial
lusts
and
guile
god
so
it
runs
made
this
world
clean
and
man
has
made
it
vile
aye
here
man
lives
on
man
and
breaks
him
day
by
day
but
in
the
trampled
jungle
the
tiger
claws
his
prey
god
curse
is
on
the
thief
the
murderer
fares
ill
who
gave
the
beasts
their
taste
for
blood
who
taught
them
how
to
kill
praise
to
him
who
built
the
hills
all
praise
to
him
who
each
stream
fills
all
praise
to
him
who
lights
each
star
that
sparkles
in
the
sky
all
praise
to
him
who
made
the
earthquake
and
the
flood
all
praise
to
him
who
made
the
pest
that
sucks
away
the
blood
all
praise
to
him
whose
mind
had
the
desire
to
make
the
shark
the
scorpion
the
gnat
and
the
envenomed
snake
beauty
itself
he
turns
to
slay
and
to
be
slain
a
thousand
evil
poisons
his
peaceful
woods
contain
up
your
heart
lift
up
your
voice
rejoice
again
i
say
rejoice
for
his
mercies
they
are
sure
his
compassion
will
endure
rejoice
because
each
man
has
but
a
man
desire
to
sin
the
little
human
sins
as
a
child
that
plays
with
fire
rejoice
because
god
plans
are
far
too
deep
for
talk
he
lets
the
swallow
feed
on
flies
then
gives
it
to
the
hawk
rejoice
because
he
made
a
world
in
some
wild
mood
a
world
that
feeds
upon
itself
god
saw
it
was
good
yet
who
are
we
to
rail
vainly
we
strive

storm

moves
in
a
mysterious
way
his
wonders
to
perform
unbelief
is
sure
to
err

been
at
peace
its
wars
are
there
is
naught
in
all
its
battles
like
these
overwrought
and
storming
hours
with
their
dark
increase
the
cities
roar
in
every
street
one
sees
women
and
children
no
slaves
no
shattered
hosts
have
ever
fought
so
bitterly
so
hopeless
of
release
well
if
it
must
be
war
take
up
the
sword
facing
the
world
with
grim
and
savage
glee
and
with
the
courage
of
a
faith
restored
strike
till
the
darkness
falters
and
we
see
that
liberty
is
no
mere
gaudy
word
and
peace
no
slothful
placid
mockery
the
dying
decadent
when
the
evening
came
he
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
a
dream
of
pallid
loveliness
he
wandered
in
a
forest
dark
and
deep
where
phantoms
passed
him
with
a
soft
caress
where
shadows
moved
and
ghostly
spirits
stood
sphinxes
of
silence
wraiths
of
mystery
a
magic
wood
a
strange
and
scented
wood
where
roses
sprang
from
every
withered
tree
a
wood
that
woke
his
wonder
and
his
fear
a
wood
of
whispered
spells
and
shameful
lore
beyond
whose
furthest
rim
he
seemed
to
hear
a
lonely
sea
upon
a
lonelier
shore
visions
swept
by
him
with
a
chanted
spell
crouched
at
his
feet
and
murmured
at
his
side
and
like
a
dim
refrain
there
rose
and
fell
the
restless
minor
of
an
ebbing
tide
then
amidst
broken
sighs
and
wafts
of
song
borne
on
the
breezes
blowing
from
the
west
he
saw
one
figure
dancing
in
the
throng
more
wan
and
wonderful
than
all
the
rest
the
singing
grew
and
nearer
still
she
came
a
being
made
of
rose
and
fire
and
mist
her
deep
eyes
burning
like
the
purple
flame
hid
in
the
heart
of
every
amethyst
and
with
the
crooning
of
the
distant
sea
she
sang
to
charm
his
soul
and
still
his
fear
oh
come
my
love
that
wanders
wearily
oh
come
for
you
have
called
and
i
am
here
oh
i
have
waited
long
to
bring
you
there
beyond
the
border
of
the
things
that
are
where
all
is
terrible
and
strange
and
fair
as
were
your
dreams
that
reached
my
favorite
star
for
you
shall
live
and
set
the
suns
to
rhyme
you
shall
escape
a
mortal
petty
fate
you
shall
behold
the
birth
and
death
of
time
oh
come
my
love
for
you
these
wonders
wait
moonlight
and
music
and
the
sound
of
waves
incanted
by
a
and
women
voices
breathing
staves
these
shall
you
have
whenever
you
may
choose
and
you
shall
know
the
maidens
of
the
moon
lying
on
lilies
shall
you
see
them
dance
and
you
shall
fling
red
roses
to
the
tune
great
roses
while
the
magic
scene
enchants
wantons
and
queens
shall
take
your
heart
to
play
and
lose
it
in
a
mesh
of
tangled
hair
and
you
shall
always
give
your
heart
away
and
find
a
new
one
every
hour
there
here
are
the
notes
of
every
nightingale
like
rare
pearls
dropping
in
a
golden
pan
and
you
shall
hear
white
music
in
each
dale
sweet
silver
sounds
that
are
not
heard
by
man
and
i
shall
show
you
all
the
world
delight
the
unknown
passion
of
each
flaming
star
your
eyes
shall
be
endowed
with
keener
sight
beyond
the
border
of
the
things
that
are
oh
come
they
wait
you
on
the
further
strand
your
drab
and
mournful
mood
they
will
exchange
for
joy
resplendent
purple
in
the
land
where
all
is
rhythmical
and
fair
and
strange
oh
come
and
learn
the
songs
unborn
unsung
and
i
shall
give
you
all
your
longing
craves
that
you
may
live
in
ecstasy
among
moonlight
and
music
and
the
sound
of
waves
entranced
he
stood
so
exquisite
the
art
that
charmed
him
he
could
scarcely
whisper
low
and
who
are
you
that
comes
to
stir
my
heart
with
fragments
of
the
songs
i
used
to
know
you
speak
of
wild
and
yet
familiar
things
exotic
passions
and
uncanny
bliss
a
thousand
dreams
your
voice
recalls
and
brings
and
who
are
you
that
shows
me
all
of
this
i
am
the
soul
and
spirit
of
your
songs
i
am
your
ballad
grief
your
lyric
fire
i
am
the
light
for
which
your
yearning
longs
your
curious
rapture
and
your
sick
desire
i
am
the
burden
that
your
lays
beseech
the
one
refrain
that
flows
through
all
your
themes
i
am
the
eerie
glamor
of
your
speech
i
am
the
mystic
radiance
of
your
dreams
come
then
with
me
where
all
men
dreams
are
born
where
winds
shall
lift
your
perfumed
thoughts
aloft
where
there
is
never
night
or
noon
or
morn
only
a
twilight
sensuous
and
soft
and
you
shall
know
the
wonder
of
each
year
the
fiery
secrets
of
a
myriad
springs
lying
on
lilies
shall
you
see
them
here
and
you
shall
live
and
touch
immortal
things
she
paused
and
sighed
slowly
he
shook
his
head
as
one
who
sees
a
guarded
flame
go
out
never
to
die
nay
that
alone
he
said
were
worse
than
all
this
wandering
in
doubt
nor
would
i
go
if
death
himself
should
come
to
crown
life
blessing
with
a
greater
gift
in
such
a
perfect
world
i
would
be
dumb
what
could
i
long
for
when
my
fancies
drift
and
more
than
this
i
do
not
choose
to
go
for
i
am
sick
of
strange
and
subtle
sounds
of
fevered
phrases
tinted
words
that
glow
and
all
the
twisting
art
that
but
astounds
i
do
not
long
for
tortured
harmonies
no
more
my
languid
soul
is
racked
and
tossed
with
yearning
for
strange
shores
and
stranger
seas
i
seek
the
visions
i
have
long
since
lost
i
seek
the
ways
of
simple
love
and
hate
once
more
i
long
to
join
the
virile
race
for
i
was
blind
till
now
and
now
too
late
i
see
the
wonder
of
the
commonplace
i
long
to
hear
men
voices
coarse
and
wild
that
never
knew
a
poet
wan
desire
i
long
to
hear
them
as
a
little
child
listens
to
elders
grouped
about
the
fire
to
hear
them
as
they
mingle
grave
and
gay
the
prudent
planning
for
the
week
and
then
amid
the
tritest
gossip
of
the
day
quaint
petty
talk
of
merchandise
and
men
i
crave
the
usual
and
homely
themes
the
everyday
of
which
no
mermaid
sings
these
are
the
fairest
fragments
of
my
dreams
these
are
the
conquering
and
deathless
things
he
ceased
a
sudden
radiance
round
him
shone
and
all
things
melted
like
a
phantom
wrack
and
as
he
swept
his
hands
and
stood
alone
he
heard
hoarse
thunders
and
the
dusk
grew
black
vast
tremors
shook
the
world
from
side
to
side
the
earth
and
sky
became
a
monstrous
blot
then
it
seems
he
woke
and
waking
died
calling
on
things
that
he
had
long
funeral
hymn
when
life
gay
courage
fails
at
last
and
i
grow
worse
than
old
though
death
puts
out
my
fiery
heart
i
never
shall
grow
cold
for
warm
is
earth
green
covering
and
warmly
i
shall
lie
wrapped
in
the
of
air
and
the
great
blue
folds
of
sky
protests
a
painting
by
hugo
something
impelled
her
from
the
hearth
whispers
and
winds
drew
her
along
but
still
unconscious
of
the
earth
she
read
her
book
of
golden
song
old
legends
stirred
her
as
she
read
of
life
victoriously
unfurled
of
glories
gone
but
never
dead
and
beauty
that
redeemed
the
world
oh
songs
she
sighed
your
world
was
fair
my
own
holds
no
such
lovely
things
no
glow
no
magic
anywhere
and
then
a
start
a
flash
of
wings
and
with
the
rush
of
surging
seas
over
her
swept
the
world
replies
the
lyric
hills
the
buoyant
breeze
and
all
the
sudden
singing
skies
