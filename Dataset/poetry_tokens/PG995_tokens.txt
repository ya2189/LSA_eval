a
song
of
spring
a
song
of
merry
mansard
days
the
cheery
among
of
rolics
and
of
roundelays
when
we
were
young
when
we
were
young
a
song
of
love
and
lilac
nights
of
wit
of
wisdom
and
of
wine
of
folly
whirling
on
the
heights
of
hunger
and
of

divine
of
blanche
suzette
and
celestine
and
all
that
gay
and
tender
band
who
shared
with
us
the
fat
the
lean
the
hazard
of
when
scores
of
philistines
we
slew
as
mightily
with
brush
and
pen
we
sought
to
make
the
world
anew
and
scorned
the
gods
of
other
men
when
we
were
fools
divinely
wise
who
held
it
rapturous
to
strive
when
art
was
sacred
in
our
eyes
and
it
was
to
be
o
days
of
glamor
glory
truth
to
you
i
raise

glass
o
freehold
of
immortal
youth
bohemia
the
lost
alas
o
laughing
lads
who
led
the
romp
respectable
you
grown
i
told
your
heads
you
bow
to
power
and
pomp
you
learned
to
know
the
worth
of
gold
o
merry
maids
who
shared
our
cheer
your
eyes
are
dim
your
locks
are
gray
and
as
you
scrub
i
sadly
fear
your
daughters
speed

dance

and

o
columbine
and

you

old
guitar

so
come
good
men
who
toil
and
tire
who
smoke
and
sip
the
kindly
cup
ring
round
about
the
tavern
fire
ere
yet
you
drink
your
liquor
up
and
hear
my
simple
songs
of
earth
of
youth
and
truth
and
living
things
of
poverty
and
proper
mirth
of
rags
and
rich
imaginings
of
days
of
hearts
elate
and
eager
breath
of
wonder
worship
pity
praise
of
sorrow
sacrifice
and
death
of
lusting
laughter

you

all
the
same
book
one
spring
i
montparnasse
april
all
day
the
sun
has
shone
into
my
little
attic
a
bitter
sunshine
that
brightened
yet
did
not
warm
and
so
as
i
toiled
and
toiled
doggedly
enough
many
were
the
looks
i
cast
at
the
three
faggots
i
had
saved
to
cook
my
evening
meal
now
however
my
supper
is
over
my
pipe
alight
and
as
i
stretch
my
legs
before
the
embers
i
have
at
last
a
glow
of
comfort
a
glimpse
of
peace
my
garret
here
is
my
garret
up
five
flights
of
stairs
here
where
i
deal
in
dreams
and
ply
in
fancies
here
is
the
of
all
my
wares
my
sounding
sonnets
and
my
red
romances
here
where
i
challenge
fate
and
ring
my
rhymes
and
grope
at
glory
aye
and
starve
at
times
here
is
my
stronghold
stout
of
heart
am
i
greeting
each
dawn
as
songful
as
a
linnet
and
when
at
night
on
yon
poor
bed
i
lie
blessing
the
world
and
every
soul
that
in
it
here
where
i
thank
the
lord
no
shadow
bars
my
skylight
vision
of
the
valiant
stars
here
is
my
palace
tapestried
with
dreams
ah
though
ten
are
all
my
treasure
while
in
my
gaze
immortal
beauty
gleams
am
i
not
dowered
with
wealth
beyond
all
measure
though
in
my
ragged
coat
my
songs
i
sing
king
of
my
soul
i
envy
not
the
king
here
is
my
haven
it
so
quiet
here
only
the
scratch
of
pen
the
candle
flutter
shabby
and
bare
and
small
but
o
how
dear
mark
you
my
table
with
my
work
my
shelf
of
tattered
books
along
the
wall
my
bed
my
broken
chair
that
nearly
all
only
four
faded
walls
yet
mine
all
mine
oh
you
fine
folks
a
pauper
scorns
your
pity
look
where
above
me
stars
of
rapture
shine
see
where
below
me
gleams
the
siren
city
am
i
not
rich
a
millionaire
no
less
if
wealth
be
told
in
terms
of
happiness
ten
i
think
one
can
sing
best
of
poverty
when
one
is
holding
it
at
arm
length
i
sure
that
when
i
wrote
these
lines
fortune
had
for
a
moment
tweaked
me
by
the
nose
however
i
am
truly
down
to
ten
it
is
for
that
i
have
stayed
in
my
room
all
day
rolled
in
my
blankets
and
clutching
my
pen
with
clammy
fingers
i
must
work
work
work
i
must
finish
my
book
before
poverty
crushes
me
i
am
not
only
writing
for
my
living
but
for
my
life
even
my
muse
was
mutinous
for
hours
and
hours
anxiously
i
stared
at
a
paper
that
was
blank
nervously
i
paced
up
and
down
my
garret
bitterly
i
flung
myself
on
my
bed
then
suddenly
it
all
came
line
after
line
i
wrote
with
hardly
a
halt
so
i
made
another
of
my
ballads
of
the
boulevards
here
it
is
julot
the
you
heard
of
julot
the
and
gigolette
his
montmartre
was
their
but
belville
was
their
home
a
little
chap
just
like
a
boy
with
smudgy
black
mustache
yet
there
was
nothing
juvenile
in
julot
the
from
head
to
heel
as
tough
as
steel
as
nimble
as
a
cat
with
every
trick
of
twist
and
kick
a
master
of
and
gigolette
was
tall
and
fair
as
stupid
as
a
cow
with
three
combs
in
the
greasy
hair
she
banged
upon
her
brow
you
see
her
on
the
place
pigalle
on
any
afternoon
a
primitive
and
strapping
wench
as
brazen
as
the
moon
and
yet
there
is
a
tale
that
told
of
clichy
after
dark
and
two
who
swung
their
arms
with
julot
for
a
mark
and
oh
but
they
have
got
him
too
they
banged
and
blazed
away
when
like
a
flash
a
woman
leapt
between
them
and
their
prey
she
took
the
medicine
meant
for
him
she
came
down
with
a
crash
quick
now
and
make
your
o
julot
the
but
no
he
turned
ran
swiftly
back
his
arms
around
her
met
they
nabbed
him
sobbing
like
a
kid
and
kissing
gigolette
now
i
a
reckless
painter
chap
who
loves
a
jamboree
and
one
night
in
cyrano
bar
i
got
upon
a
spree
and
there
were
trollops
all
about
and
crooks
of
every
kind
but
though
the
place
was
reeling
round
i
did
seem
to
mind
till
down
i
sank
and
all
was
blank
when
in
the
bleary
dawn
i
woke
up
in
my
studio
to
find
my
money
gone
three
hundred
francs
i
scraped
and
squeezed
to
pay
my
quarter
rent
some
one
has
pinched
my
wad
i
wailed
it
never
has
been
spent
and
as
i
racked
my
brains
to
seek
how
i
could
raise
some
more
before
my
cruel
landlord
kicked
me
cowering
from
the
door
a
knock
come
in
i
gruffly
groaned
i
did
not
raise
my
head
then
lo
i
heard
a
husky
voice
a
swift
and
silky
tread
you
got
so
blind
last
night
i
collared
all
your
cash
three
hundred
there
de
said
julot
the
and
that
was
how
i
came
to
know
julot
and
gigolette
and
we
would
talk
and
drink
a
and
smoke
a
cigarette
and
i
would
meditate
upon
the
artistry
of
crime
and
he
would
tell
of
cracking
cribs
and
cops
and
doing
time
or
else
when
he
was
flush
of
funds
he
carelessly
explain
he
biffed
some
bloated
on
the
border
of
the
seine
so
gentle
and
polite
he
was
just
like
a
man
of
peace
and
not
a
desperado
and
the
terror
of
the
police
now
one
day
in
a
that
behind
the
place
vendôme
i
came
on
julot
the
and
gigolette
his
and
as
they
looked
so
very
grave
says
i
to
them
says
i
come
on
and
have
a
little
glass
it
good
to
rinse
the
eye
you
both
look
mighty
serious
you
something
on
the
heart
ah
yes
said
julot
the
we
something
to
impart
when
such
things
come
to
folks
like
us
it
is
very
gay
it
gigolette
she
tells
me
that
a
is
on
the
way
then
gigolette
she
looked
at
me
with
eyes
like
stones
of
gall
if
we
were
honest
folks
said
she
i
would
mind
at
all
but
then
you
know
the
life
we
lead
well
anyway
i
mean
that
is
providing
it
a
girl
to
call
her
angeline
cheer
up
said
i
it
all
in
life
there
gold
within
the
dross
come
on
we
drink
another
to
angeline
the
and
so
the
weary
winter
passed
and
then
one
april
morn
the
worthy
julot
came
at
last
to
say
the
babe
was
born
i
like
to
chuck
it
in
the
seine
he
sourly
snarled
and
yet
i
guess
i
have
to
let
it
live
because
of
gigolette
i
only
laughed
for
sure
i
saw
his
spite
was
all
a
bluff
and
he
was
prouder
than
a
prince
behind
his
manner
gruff
yet
every
day
he
blast
the
brat
with
curses
deep
and
grim
and
swear
to
me
that
gigolette
no
longer
thought
of
and
then
one
night
he
dropped
the
mask
his
eyes
were
sick
with
dread
and
when
i
offered
him
a
smoke
he
groaned
and
shook
his
head
i
all
upset
it
angeline
she
covered
with
a
rash
she
maybe
die
my
little
cried
julot
the
but
angeline
i
joy
to
say
came
through
the
test
all
right
though
julot
so
they
tell
me
watched
beside
her
day
and
night
and
when
i
saw
him
next
says
he
come
up
and
dine
with
me
we
buy
a
beefsteak
on
the
way
a
bottle
and
some
and
so
i
had
a
merry
night
within
his
humble
home
and
laughed
with
angeline
the
and
gigolette
the
and
every
time
that
julot
used
a
word
the
least
obscene
how
gigolette
would
frown
at
him
and
point
to
angeline
oh
such
a
little
innocent
with
hair
of
silken
floss
i
do
not
wonder
they
were
proud
of
angeline
the
and
when
her
arms
were
round
his
neck
then
julot
says
to
me
i
must
work
harder
now
since
i
to
work
for
three
he
worked
so
very
hard
indeed
the
police
dropped
in
one
day
and
for
a
year
behind
the
bars
they
put
him
safe
away
so
dark
and
silent
now
their
home
they
gone
i
wondered
where
till
in
a
laundry
near
i
saw
a
child
with
shining
hair
and
the
tub
a
strapping
wench
her
arms
in
soapy
foam
lo
it
was
angeline
the
and
gigolette
the
and
so
i
kept
an
eye
on
them
and
saw
that
all
went
right
until
at
last
came
julot
home
half
crazy
with
delight
and
when
he
kissed
them
both
says
he
i
had
my
fill
this
time
i
on
the
honest
now
i
am
i
all
fed
up
with
crime
you
mark
my
words
the
page
i
turn
is
going
to
be
clean
i
swear
it
on
the
head
of
her
my
little
angeline
and
so
to
finish
up
my
tale
this
morning
as
i
strolled
along
the
boulevard
i
heard
a
voice
i
knew
of
old
i
saw
a
rosy
little
man
with
mustache
i
stopped
i
by
all
the
gods
was
julot
the
i
in
the
garden
way
he
said
and
doing
mighty
well
i
half
an
acre
under
glass
and
heaps
of
truck
to
sell
come
out
and
see
oh
come
my
friend
on
sunday
wet
or
shine
say
the
first
communion
of
that
little
girl
of
ii
montparnasse
same
is
an
anniversary
a
year
ago
i
kicked
over
an
office
stool
and
came
to
paris
thinking
to
make
a
living
by
my
pen
i
was
twenty
then
and
in
my
pocket
i
had
twenty
pounds
of
that
my
ten
are
all
that
remain
and
so
i
am
going
to
spend
them
not
prudently
on
bread
but
prodigally
on
beer
as
i
stroll
down
the
boul
mich
the
lingering
light
has
all
the
exquisite
tenderness
of
violet
the
trees
are
in
their
first
translucent
green
beneath
them
the
lamps
are
lit
with
purest
gold
and
from
the
little
luxembourg
comes
a
silver
jangle
of
tiny
voices
taking
the
gay
side
of
the
street
i
enter
a
cafe
although
it
is
its
true
name
i
choose
to
call
my
cafe
o
tavern
of
the
golden
snail
ten
have
i
so
i
regale
ten
your
amber
brew
to
sip
eight
for
the
and
two
the
tip
and
so
i
sit
the
evening
long
and
smoke
my
pipe
and
watch
the
throng
the
giddy
crowd
that
drains
and
drinks
i
watch
it
quiet
as
a
sphinx
and
who
among
them
all
shall
buy
for
ten
poor
such
joy
as
i
as
i
who
snugly
tucked
away
look
on
it
all
as
on
a
play
a
frolic
scene
of
love
and
fun
to
please
an
audience
of
one
o
tavern
of
the
golden
snail
you
stuff
indeed
for
many
a
tale
all
eyes
all
ears
i
nothing
miss
two
lovers
lean
to
clasp
and
kiss
the
merry
students
sing
and
shout
the
nimble
dart
about
lo
here
come
mimi
and
musette
with
vous
plait
une
cigarette
marcel
and
rudolf
shaunard
too
behold
the
old
rapscallion
crew
with
flowing
tie
and
shaggy
head
who
says
bohemia
is
dead
oh
shades
of
murger
prank
and
clown
and
i
will
watch
and
write
it
down
o
tavern
of
the
golden
snail
what
crackling
throats
have
gulped
your
ale
what
sons
of
fame
from
far
and
near
have
glowed
and
mellowed
in
your
cheer
within
this
corner
where
i
sit
banville
and
coppée
clashed
their
wit
and
hither
too
to
dream
and
drain
and
drown
despair
came
poor
verlaine
here
wilde
would
talk
and
synge
would
muse
maybe
like
me
with
just
ten
ah
one
is
lucky
is
one
not
with
ghosts
so
rare
to
drain
a
pot
so
may
your
custom
never
fail
o
tavern
of
the
golden
snail
there
my
pipe
is
out
let
me
light
it
again
and
consider
i
have
no
illusions
about
myself
i
am
not
fool
enough
to
think
i
am
a
poet
but
i
have
a
knack
of
rhyme
and
i
love
to
make
verses
mine
is
a
tootling
music
humbly
and
afar
i
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
praed
and
lampson
of
field
and
riley
hoping
that
in
time
my
muse
may
bring
me
bread
and
butter
so
far
however
it
has
been
all
kicks
and
no
coppers
and
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
tether
i
wish
i
knew
where
breakfast
was
coming
from
well
since
rhyming
been
my
ruin
let
me
rhyme
to
the
bitter
end
it
is
later
than
you
think
lone
amid
the
cafe
cheer
sad
of
heart
am
i
dolefully
i
drink
my
beer
but
no
single
line
i
write
there
the
wretched
rent
to
pay
yet
i
glower
at
pen
and
ink
oh
inspire
me
muse
i
pray
is
later
than
you
think
hello
there
a
pregnant
phrase
bravo
let
me
write
it
down
hold
it
with
a
hopeful
gaze
gauge
it
with
a
fretful
frown
tune
it
to
my
lyric
lyre
ah
upon
starvation
brink
how
the
words
are
dark
and
dire
it
is
later
than
you
think
weigh
them
behold
yon
band
students
drinking
by
the
door
madly
merry
in
hand
saucers
stacked
to
mark
their
score
get
you
gone
you
jolly
scamps
let
your
parting
glasses
clink
seek
your
long
neglected
lamps
it
is
later
than
you
think
look
again
yon
dainty
blonde
all
allure
and
golden
grace
oh
so
willing
to
respond
should
you
turn
a
smiling
face
play
your
part
poor
pretty
doll
feast
and
frolic
pose
and
prink
there
the
morgue
to
end
it
all
and
it
later
than
you
think
yon
a
playwright
mark
his
face
puffed
and
purple
tense
and
tired
he
holds
his
place
hated
envied
and
admired
how
you
gobble
life
my
friend
wine
and
woman
soft
and
pink
well
each
tether
has
its
end
sir
it
later
than
you
think
see
yon
living
scarecrow
pass
with
a
wild
and
wolfish
stare
at
each
empty
absinthe
glass
as
if
he
saw
heaven
there
poor
damned
wretch
to
end
your
pain
there
is
still
the
greater
drink
yonder
waits
the
sanguine
seine
it
is
later
than
you
think
lastly
you
who
read
aye
you
who
this
very
line
may
scan
think
of
all
you
planned
to
do
have
you
done
the
best
you
can
see
the
tavern
lights
are
low
black
the
night
and
how
you
shrink
god
and
is
it
time
to
go
ah
the
clock
is
always
slow
it
is
later
than
you
think
sadly
later
than
you
think
far
far
later
than
you
think
scarcely
do
i
scribble
that
last
line
on
the
back
of
an
old
envelope
when
a
voice
hails
me
it
is
a
fellow
a
man
called
macbean
he
is
having
a
feast
of
and
he
asks
me
to
join
him
macbean
is
a
scotsman
with
the
soul
of
an
irishman
he
has
a
keen
lean
spectacled
face
and
if
it
were
not
for
his
gray
hair
he
might
be
taken
for
a
student
of
theology
however
there
is
nothing
of
the
puritan
in
macbean
he
loves
wine
and
women
and
money
melts
in
his
fingers
he
has
lived
so
long
in
the
quarter
he
looks
at
life
from
the
parisian
angle
his
knowledge
of
literature
is
such
that
he
might
be
a
professor
but
he
would
rather
be
a
vagabond
of
letters
we
talk
shop
we
discuss
the
american
short
story
but
macbean
vows
they
do
these
things
better
in
france
he
says
that
some
of
the
printed
every
day
in
the
are
worthy
of
maupassant
after
that
he
buys
more
beer
and
we
roam
airily
over
the
fields
of
literature
plucking
here
and
there
a
blossom
of
quotation
a
fine
talk
vivid
and
eager
it
puts
me
into
a
kind
of
glow
macbean
pays
the
bill
from
a
handful
of
big
notes
and
the
thought
of
my
own
empty
pockets
for
a
moment
damps
me
however
when
we
rise
to
go
it
is
well
after
midnight
and
i
am
in
a
pleasant
daze
the
rest
of
the
evening
may
be
summed
up
in
the
following
jingle
noctambule
zut
it
two
see
the
lights
are
jumping
finish
up
your
time
we
all
were
humping

the
chairs
pile
them
on
the
tables
let
us
to
our
lairs
underneath
the
gables
up
the
old
boul
climb
with
steps
erratic
steady
how
i
wish
i
was
in
my
attic
full
am
i
with
cheer
in
my
heart
the
joy
stirs
could
be
the
beer
must
have
been
the
oysters
in
obscene
array
garbage
cans
spill
over
how
i
wish
that
they
smelled
as
sweet
as
clover
charing
women
wait
cafes
drop
their
shutters
rats
perambulate
up
and
down
the
gutters
down
the

insomnia
heigh
ho
to

i
vainly
try
since
twelve
i
have
closed
an
eye
and
now
it
three
and
as
i
lie
from
notre
dame
to
denis
the
bells
of
paris
chime
to
me
you
young
they
say
and
strong
and
free
i
do
not
turn
with
sighs
and
groans
to
ease
my
limbs
to
rest
my
bones
as
if
my
bed
were
stuffed
with
stones
no
peevish
murmur
tips
my
tongue
ah
no
for
every
sound
upflung
says
lad
you
free
and
strong
and
young
and
so
beneath
the
sheet
caress
my
body
purrs
with
happiness
joy
bubbles
in
my
ah
yes
my
very
blood
that
leaps
along
is
chiming
in
a
joyous
song
because
i
young
and
free
and
strong
maybe
it
is
the
springtide
i
am
so
happy
i
am
afraid
the
sense
of
living
fills
me
with
exultation
i
want
to
sing
to
dance
i
am
dithyrambic
with
delight
i
think
the
moon
must
be
to
blame
it
fills
the
room
with
fairy
flame
it
paints
the
wall
it
seems
to
pour
a
dappled
flood
upon
the
floor
i
rise
and
through
the
window
stare
ye
gods
how
marvelously
fair
from
montrouge
to
the
martyr
hill
a
silver
city
rapt
and
still
dim
drowsy
deeps
of
opal
haze
and
spire
and
dome
in
diamond
blaze
the
little
lisping
leaves
of
spring
like
sequins
softly
glimmering
each
roof
a
plaque
of
argent
sheen
a
gauzy
gulf
the
space
between
each
a
thing
of
grace
where
merry
moonbeams
prank
and
chase
and
all
that
sordid
was
and
mean
just
beauty
deathless
and
serene
o
magic
city
of
a
dream
from
glory
unto
glory
gleam
and
i
will
gaze
and
pity
those
who
on
their
pillows
drowse
and
doze
and
as
i
nothing
else
to
do
of
tea
i
make
a
rousing
brew
and
coax
my
pipes
until
they
croon
and
chant
a
ditty
to
the
moon
there
my
tea
is
black
and
strong
inspiration
comes
with
every
sip
now
for
the
moon
the
moon
peeped
out
behind
the
hill
as
yellow
as
an
apricot
then
up
and
up
it
climbed
until
into
the
sky
it
fairly
got
the
sky
was
vast
and
violet
the
poor
moon
seemed
to
faint
in
fright
and
pale
it
grew
and
paler
yet
like
fine
old
silver
rinsed
and
bright
and
yet
it
climbed
so
bravely
on
until
it
mounted
then
earthward
it
serenely
shone
a
silver
sovereign
of
the
sky
a
bland
sultana
of
the
night
surveying
realms
of
lily
light
moon
song
a
child
saw
in
the
morning
skies
the
moon
and
opened
wide
her
big
blue
eyes
and
cried
look
look
my
lost
balloon
and
clapped
her
rosy
hands
with
glee
quick
mother
bring
it
back
to
me
a
poet
in
a
lilied
pond
espied
the
moon
reflected
charms
and
ravished
by
that
beauty
blonde
leapt
out
to
clasp
her
in
his
arms
and
as
he
never
learnt
to
swim
poor
fool
that
was
the
end
of
him
a
rustic
glimpsed
amid
the
trees
the
bluff
moon
caught
as
in
a
snare
they
say
it
do
be
made
of
cheese
said
giles
and
that
a
chap
bides
that
blue
boar
ale
be
strong
i
vow
the
lad
at
me
now
two
lovers
watched
the
new
moon
hold
the
old
moon
in
her
bright
embrace
said
she
there
mother
pale
and
old
and
drawing
near
her
resting
place
said
he
be
mine
and
with
me
wed
she
stared
she
shook
her
head
a
soldier
saw
with
dying
eyes
the
bleared
moon
like
a
ball
of
blood
and
thought
of
how
in
other
skies
so
pearly
bright
on
leaf
and
bud
like
peace
its
soft
white
beams
had
lain
peace
he
closed
his
eyes
again
child
lover
poet
soldier
clown
ah
yes
old
moon
what
things
you
seen
i
marvel
now
as
you
look
down
how
can
your
face
be
so
serene
and
tranquil
still
you
make
your
round
old
moon
when
we
are
underground
and
now
blow
out
your
candle
lad
and
get
to
bed
see
the
dawn
is
in
the
sky
open
your
window
and
let
its
freshness
rouge
your
cheek
you
earned
your
rest
sleep
aye
but
before
i
do
so
let
me
read
again
the
last
of
my
the
the
humble
garret
where
i
dwell
is
in
that
quarter
called
the
latin
it
is
spacious
truth
to
tell
there
hardly
room
to
swing
a
cat
in
but
what
of
that
it
there
i
fight
for
food
and
fame
my
muse
inviting
and
all
the
day
and
half
the
night
you
find
me
writing
writing
writing
now
it
was
in
the
month
of
may
as
wrestling
with
a
rhyme
rheumatic
i
chanced
to
look
across
the
way
and
lo
within
a
neighbor
attic
a
hand
drew
back
the
window
shade
and
there
a
picture
glad
and
glowing
i
saw
a
sweet
and
slender
maid
and
she
was
sewing
sewing
sewing
so
poor
the
room
so
small
so
scant
yet
somehow
oh
so
bright
and
airy
there
was
a
pink
geranium
plant
likewise
a
very
pert
canary
and
in
the
maiden
heart
it
seemed
some
fount
of
gladness
must
be
springing
for
as
alone
i
sadly
dreamed
i
heard
her
singing
singing
singing
god
love
her
how
it
cheered
me
then
to
see
her
there
so
brave
and
pretty
so
she
with
needle
i
with
pen
we
slaved
and
sang
above
the
city
and
as
across
my
streams
of
ink
i
watched
her
from
a
poet
distance
she
stitched
and
sang
i
scarcely
think
she
was
aware
of
my
existence
and
then
one
day
she
sang
no
more
that
put
me
out
there
no
denying
i
looked
she
labored
as
before
but
bless
me
she
was
crying
crying
her
poor
canary
chirped
in
vain
her
pink
geranium
drooped
in
sorrow
of
course
said
i
she
sing
again
maybe
i
sighed
she
will
poor
child
was
finished
with
her
song
day
after
day
her
tears
were
flowing
and
as
i
wondered
what
was
wrong
she
pined
and
peaked
above
her
sewing
and
then
one
day
the
blind
she
drew
ah
though
i
sought
with
vain
endeavor
to
pierce
the
darkness
well
i
knew
my
had
gone
for
ever
and
as
i
sit
alone
my
eyes
unto
her
room
are
turning
i
give
the
sum
of
all
i
write
once
more
to
see
her
candle
burning
once
more
to
glimpse
her
happy
face
and
while
my
rhymes
of
cheer
i
ringing
across
the
sunny
sweep
of
space
to
hear
her
singing
singing
singing
heigh
ho
i
realize
i
am
very
weary
it
nice
to
be
so
tired
and
to
know
one
can
sleep
as
long
as
one
wants
the
morning
sunlight
floods
in
at
my
window
so
i
draw
the
blind
and
throw
myself
on
my
iv
my
garret
montparnasse
april
hurrah
as
i
opened
my
eyes
this
morning
to
a
hard
unfeeling
world
little
did
i
think
what
a
surprise
awaited
me
a
big
blue
envelope
had
been
pushed
under
my
door
another
rejection
i
thought
and
i
took
it
up
distastefully
the
next
moment
i
was
staring
at
my
first
cheque
it
was
an
express
order
for
two
hundred
francs
in
payment
of
a
bit
of
so
i
will
celebrate
i
will
lunch
at
the
i
will
dine
on
the
grand
boulevard
i
will
go
to
the
theater
well
here
the
thing
that
has
turned
the
tide
for
me
it
is
somewhat
in
the
vein
of
sourdough
service
the
yukon
bard
i
do
think
much
of
his
stuff
but
they
say
he
makes
heaps
of
money
i
can
well
believe
it
for
he
drives
a
in
the
bois
every
afternoon
the
other
night
he
was
with
a
crowd
at
the
dome
cafe
a
chubby
chap
who
sits
in
a
corner
and
seldom
speaks
i
was
disappointed
i
thought
he
was
a
big
hairy
man
who
swore
like
a
trooper
and
mixed
brandy
with
his
beer
he
only
drank
vichy
poor
fellow
lucille
of
course
you
heard
of
the
and
how
she
sailed
away
on
her
famous
quest
of
the
arctic
flea
to
the
wilds
of
hudson
bay
for
it
was
a
foreign
prince
whim
to
collect
this
tiny
cuss
and
a
golden
quid
was
no
more
to
him
than
a
copper
to
coves
like
us
so
we
sailed
away
and
our
hearts
were
gay
as
we
gazed
on
the
gorgeous
scene
and
we
laughed
with
glee
as
we
caught
the
flea
of
the
wolf
and
the
wolverine
yea
our
hearts
were
light
as
the
parasite
of
the
ermine
rat
we
slew
and
the
great
musk
ox
and
the
silver
fox
and
the
moose
and
the
caribou
and
we
laughed
with
zest
as
the
insect
pest
of
the
marmot
crowned
our
zeal
and
the
wary
mink
and
the
wily
link
and
the
walrus
and
the
seal
and
with
eyes
aglow
on
the
scornful
snow
we
danced
a
rigadoon
round
the
lonesome
lair
of
the
arctic
hare
by
the
light
of
the
silver
moon
but
the
time
was
nigh
to
homeward
hie
when
imagine
our
despair
for
the
best
of
the
lot
we
had
got
the
flea
of
the
polar
bear
oh
his
face
was
long
and
his
breath
was
strong
as
the
skipper
he
says
to
me
i
wants
you
to
linger
my
lad
by
the
shores
of
the
hartic
sea
i
wants
you
to
the
polar
bear
the
perishin
winter
through
and
if
flea
ye
find
of
its
breed
and
kind
there
a
quid
for
you
but
i
shook
my
head
no
cap
i
said
it
yourself
i
like
to
please
but
i
tells
ye
flat
i
would
do
that
if
ye
went
on
yer
bended
knees
then
the
captain
spat
in
the
seething
brine
and
he
says
good
luck
to
you
if
it
ca
be
did
for
a
quid
supposin
we
call
it
two
so
that
was
why
they
said
and
they
sailed
and
left
me
there
alone
alone
in
the
arctic
zone
to
hunt
for
the
polar
bear
oh
the
days
were
slow
and
packed
with
woe
till
i
thought
they
would
never
end
and
i
used
to
sit
when
the
fire
was
lit
with
my
pipe
for
my
only
friend
and
i
tried
to
sing
some
rollicky
thing
but
my
song
broke
off
in
a
prayer
and
i
drowse
and
dream
by
the
driftwood
gleam
i
dream
of
a
polar
bear
i
dream
of
a
cloudlike
polar
bear
that
blotted
the
stars
on
high
with
ravenous
jaws
and
flenzing
claws
and
the
flames
of
hell
in
his
eye
and
i
trap
around
on
the
frozen
ground
as
a
proper
hunter
ought
and
beasts
i
find
of
every
kind
but
never
the
one
i
sought
never
a
track
in
the
white
that
humped
and
heaved
and
flawed
till
i
came
to
think
why
strike
me
pink
if
the
creature
ai
a
fraud
and
then
one
night
in
the
waning
light
as
i
hurried
home
to
sup
i
hears
a
roar
by
the
cabin
door
and
a
great
white
hulk
heaves
up
so
my
rifle
flashed
and
a
bullet
crashed
dead
dead
as
a
stone
fell
he
and
i
gave
a
cheer
for
there
in
his
ear
gosh
ding
me
a
tiny
flea
at
last
at
last
oh
i
clutched
it
fast
and
i
gazed
on
it
with
pride
and
i
thrust
it
into
a
and
i
shut
it
safe
inside
with
a
lid
of
glass
for
the
light
to
pass
and
space
to
leap
and
play
oh
it
kept
alive
yea
seemed
to
thrive
as
i
watched
it
night
and
day
and
i
used
to
sit
and
sing
to
it
and
i
shielded
it
from
harm
and
many
a
hearty
feed
it
had
on
the
heft
of
my
hairy
arm
for
you
never
know
in
that
land
of
snow
how
lonesome
a
man
can
feel
so
i
made
a
fuss
of
the
little
cuss
and
i
christened
it
lucille
but
the
longest
winter
has
its
end
and
the
ice
went
out
to
sea
and
i
saw
one
day
a
ship
in
the
bay
and
there
was
the
so
a
boat
was
lowered
and
i
went
aboard
and
they
opened
wide
their
eyes
yes
they
gave
a
cheer
when
the
truth
was
clear
and
they
saw
my
precious
prize
and
then
it
was
all
like
a
giddy
dream
but
to
cut
my
story
short
we
sailed
away
on
the
fifth
of
may
to
the
foreign
prince
court
to
a
palmy
land
and
a
palace
grand
and
the
little
prince
was
there
and
a
fat
princess
in
a
satin
dress
with
a
crown
of
gold
on
her
hair
and
they
showed
me
into
a
shiny
room
just
him
and
her
and
me
and
the
prince
he
was
pleased
and
and
he
calls
for
drinks
for
three
and
i
shows
them
my
battered
and
i
makes
my
modest
spiel
and
they
laughed
they
did
when
i
opened
the
lid
and
out
there
popped
lucille
oh
the
prince
was
glad
i
could
soon
see
that
and
the
princess
she
was
too
and
lucille
waltzed
round
on
the
tablecloth
as
she
often
used
to
do
and
the
prince
pulled
out
a
purse
of
gold
and
he
put
it
in
my
hand
and
he
says
it
was
worth
all
that
i
told
to
stay
in
that
nasty
land
and
then
he
turned
with
a
sudden
cry
and
he
clutched
at
his
royal
beard
and
the
princess
screamed
and
well
she
might
for
lucille
had
disappeared
she
must
be
here
said
his
noble
nibbs
so
we
hunted
all
around
oh
we
searched
that
place
but
never
a
trace
of
the
little
beast
we
found
so
i
shook
my
head
and
i
glumly
said
gol
darn
the
saucy
cuss
it
mighty
queer
but
she
is
here
so
she
must
be
on
one
of
us
you
pardon
me
if
i
make
so
free
but
there
just
one
thing
to
do
if
you
kindly
go
for
a
half
a
mo
i
search
me
garments
through
then
all
alone
on
the
shiny
throne
i
stripped
from
head
to
heel
in
vain
in
vain
it
was
very
plain
that
i
had
got
lucille
so
i
garbed
again
and
i
told
the
prince
and
he
scratched
his
august
head
i
suppose
if
she
has
selected
you
it
must
be
me
he
said
so
retired
but
he
soon
came
back
and
his
features
showed
distress
oh
it
is
you
and
it
is
then
we
looked
at
the
princess
so
retired
and
we
heard
a
scream
and
she
opened
wide
the
door
and
her
fingers
twain
were
pinched
to
pain
but
a
radiant
smile
she
wore
it
here
she
cries
our
precious
prize
oh
i
found
it
right
then
i
ran
to
her
with
a
shout
of
joy
but
i
choked
with
a
wild
dismay
i
clutched
the
back
of
the
golden
throne
and
the
room
began
to
reel
what
she
held
to
me
was
ah
yes
a
flea
but
was
my
after
all
i
did
not
celebrate
i
sat
on
the
terrace
of
the
cafe
napolitain
on
the
grand
boulevard
half
hypnotized
by
the
passing
crowd
and
as
i
sat
i
fell
into
conversation
with
a
stranger
who
sipped
some
golden
ambrosia
he
told
me
he
was
an
actor
and
introduced
me
to
his
beverage
which
he
called
a
he
soon
left
me
but
the
effect
of
the
golden
liquid
remained
and
there
came
over
me
a
desire
to
write
plus
fort
que
so
instead
of
going
to
the
folies
bergère
i
spent
all
evening
in
the
omnium
bar
near
the
bourse
and
wrote
the
following
on
the
boulevard
oh
it
pleasant
sitting
here
seeing
all
the
people
pass
you
beside
your
of
beer
i
behind
my
chatting
of
no
matter
what
you
the
mummer
i
the
bard
oh
it
jolly
is
it
not
sitting
on
the
boulevard
more
amusing
than
a
book
if
a
chap
has
eyes
to
see
for
no
matter
where
i
look
stories
stories
jump
at
me
moving
tales
my
pen
might
write
poems
plain
on
every
face
monologues
you
could
recite
with
inimitable
grace
ah
imagination
power
see
yon
there
idly
toying
with
a
flower
smiling
with
a
pensive
air
well
her
smile
is
but
a
mask
for
i
saw
within
her
muff
such
a
wicked
little
flask
vitriol
ugh
the
beastly
stuff
now
look
back
beside
the
bar
see
yon
curled
and
scented
puffing
at
a
fine
cigar
espèce
de
well
of
course
it
all
surmise
it
for
him
she
holds
her
place
when
he
passes
she
will
rise
dash
the
vitriol
in
his
face
quick
they
carry
him
away
pack
him
in
a
red
cross
car
her
they
hurry
so
they
say
to
the
cells
of
lazare
what
will
happen
then
you
ask
what
will
all
the
sequel
be
ah
imagination
task
is
easy
let
me
see
she
will
go
to
jail
no
doubt
for
a
year
or
maybe
two
then
as
soon
as
she
gets
out
start
her
bawdy
life
anew
he
will
lie
within
a
ward
harmless
as
a
man
can
be
with
his
face
grotesquely
scarred
and
his
eyes
that
can
not
see
then
amid
the
city
din
he
will
stand
against
a
wall
with
around
his
neck
a
tin
into
which
the
pennies
fall
she
will
pass
i
see
it
plain
like
a
cinematograph
she
will
halt
and
turn
again
look
and
look
and
maybe
laugh
well
i
not
so
sure
of
that
whether
she
will
laugh
or
cry
he
will
hold
a
battered
hat
to
the
lady
passing
by
he
will
smile
a
cringing
smile
and
into
his
grimy
hold
with
a
laugh
or
sob
the
while
she
will
drop
a
piece
of
gold
bless
you
lady
he
will
say
and
get
grandly
drunk
that
night
she
will
come
and
come
each
day
fascinated
by
the
sight
then
somehow
he
get
to
know
maybe
by
some
kindly
friend
who
she
is
and
so
and
so
bring
my
story
to
an
end
how
his
heart
will
burst
with
hate
he
will
curse
and
he
will
cry
he
will
wait
and
wait
and
wait
till
again
she
passes
by
then
like
tiger
from
its
lair
he
will
leap
from
out
his
place
down
her
clutch
her
by
the
hair
smear
the
vitriol
on
her
face
ah
imagination
rare
see
he
takes
his
hat
to
go
now
he
level
with
her
chair
now
she
rises
up
to
and
she
has
done
it
oh
those
screams
those
hideous
screams
i
imagined
and
it
true
how
his
face
will
haunt
my
dreams
what
a
sight
it
makes
me
sick
seems
i
am
to
blame
somehow
fetch
a
brandy
quick
there
i
feeling
better
now
let
collaborate
we
two
you
the
mummer
i
the
bard
oh
what
ripping
stuff
we
do
sitting
on
the
boulevard
it
is
strange
how
one
works
easily
at
times
i
wrote
this
so
quickly
that
i
might
almost
say
i
had
reached
the
end
before
i
had
come
to
the
beginning
in
such
a
mood
i
wonder
why
everybody
does
not
write
poetry
get
a
roget
a
rhyming
dictionary
sit
before
your
typewriter
with
a
strong
glass
of
coffee
at
your
elbow
and
just
click
the
stuff
off
facility
so
easy
is
to
make
a
rhyme
that
did
the
world
but
know
it
your
coachman
might
parnassus
climb
your
butler
be
a
poet
then
oh
how
charming
it
would
be
if
when
in
haste
hysteric
you
called
the
page
you
learned
that
he
was
grappling
with
a
lyric
or
else
what
rapture
it
would
yield
when
cook
sent
up
the
salad
to
find
within
its
depths
concealed
a
touching
little
ballad
or
if
for
tea
and
toast
you
yearned
what
joy
to
find
upon
it
the
chambermaid
had
coyly
laid
a
palpitating
sonnet
your
baker
could
the
fashion
set
your
butcher
might
respond
well
with
every
tart
a
triolet
with
every
chop
a
rondel
your
tailor
bill
well
i
be
blowed
dear
chap
i
never
knowed
him
he
gone
and
written
me
an
ode
instead
of
what
i
him
so
easy
is
to
rhyme
yet
stay
oh
terrible
misgiving
please
do
not
give
the
game
away
i
got
to
make
my
living
v
my
garret
may
golden
days
another
day
of
toil
and
strife
another
page
so
white
within
that
fateful
log
of
life
that
i
and
all
must
write
another
page
without
a
stain
to
make
of
as
i
may
that
done
i
shall
not
see
again
until
the
judgment
day
ah
could
i
could
i
backward
turn
the
pages
of
that
book
how
often
would
i
blench
and
burn
how
often
loathe
to
look
what
pages
would
be
meanly
scrolled
what
smeared
as
if
with
mud
a
few
maybe
might
gleam
like
gold
some
scarlet
seem
as
blood
o
record
grave
god
guide
my
hand
and
make
me
worthy
be
since
what
i
write
shall
stand
to
all
eternity
aye
teach
me
lord
of
life
i
pray
as
i
salute
the
sun
to
bear
myself
that
every
day
may
be
a
golden
one
i
awoke
this
morning
to
see
the
bright
sunshine
flooding
my
garret
no
chamber
in
the
palace
of
a
king
could
have
been
more
fair
how
i
sang
as
i
dressed
how
i
lingered
over
my
coffee
savoring
every
drop
how
carefully
i
packed
my
pipe
gazing
serenely
over
the
roofs
of
paris
never
is
the
city
so
lovely
as
in
this
month
of
may
when
all
the
trees
are
in
the
fullness
of
their
foliage
as
i
look
i
feel
a
freshness
of
vision
in
my
eyes
wonder
wakes
in
me
the
simplest
things
move
me
to
delight
the
joy
of
little
things
it
good
the
great
green
earth
to
roam
where
sights
of
awe
the
soul
inspire
but
oh
it
best
the
coming
home
the
crackle
of
one
own
you
with
the
solemn
past
you
seen
the
pageantry
of
kings
yet
oh
how
sweet
to
gain
at
last
the
peace
and
rest
of
little
things
perhaps
you
counted
with
the
great
you
strain
and
strive
with
mighty
men
your
hand
is
on
the
helm
of
state
you
stride
and
then
there
comes
a
pause
a
shining
hour
a
dog
that
leaps
a
hand
that
clings
o
titan
turn
from
pomp
and
power
give
all
your
heart
to
little
things
go
couch
you
childwise
in
the
grass
believing
it
some
jungle
strange
where
mighty
monsters
peer
and
pass
where
beetles
roam
and
spiders
range
gloom
and
gleam
of
leaf
and
blade
what
dragons
rasp
their
painted
wings
o
magic
world
of
shine
and
shade
o
beauty
land
of
little
things
i
sometimes
wonder
after
all
amid
this
tangled
web
of
fate
if
what
is
great
may
not
be
small
and
what
is
small
may
not
be
great
so
wondering
i
go
my
way
yet
in
my
heart
contentment
sings
o
may
i
ever
see
i
pray
god
grace
and
love
in
little
things
so
give
to
me
i
only
beg
a
little
roof
to
call
my
own
a
little
cider
in
the
keg
a
little
meat
upon
the
bone
a
little
garden
by
the
sea
a
little
boat
that
dips
and
swings
take
wealth
take
fame
but
leave
to
me
o
lord
of
life
just
little
things
yesterday
i
finished
my
tenth
ballad
when
i
have
done
about
a
score
i
will
seek
a
publisher
if
i
can
not
find
one
i
will
earn
beg
or
steal
the
money
to
get
them
printed
then
if
they
do
not
sell
i
will
hawk
them
from
door
to
door
oh
i
succeed
i
know
i
succeed
and
yet
i
do
want
an
easy
success
give
me
the
joy
of
the
fight
the
thrill
of
the
adventure
here
my
last
ballad
the
absinthe
drinkers
he
yonder
on
the
terrace
of
the
cafe
de
la
paix
the
little
wizened
spanish
man
i
see
him
every
day
he
sitting
with
his
pernod
on
his
customary
chair
he
staring
at
the
passers
with
his
customary
stare
he
never
takes
his
piercing
eyes
from
off
that
moving
throng
that
current
cosmopolitan
meandering
along
dark
diplomats
from
martinique
pale
rastas
from
peru
an
englishman
from
bloomsbury
a
yank
from
kalamazoo
a
poet
from
montmartre
heights
a
dapper
little
jap
exotic
citizens
of
all
the
countries
on
the
map
a
tourist
horde
from
every
land
that
underneath
the
sun
that
little
wizened
spanish
man
he
misses
never
one
oh
foul
or
fair
he
always
there
and
many
a
drink
he
buys
and
there
a
fire
of
red
desire
within
his
hollow
eyes
and
sipping
of
my
pernod
and
what
i
know
sometimes
i
want
to
shriek
aloud
and
give
away
the
show
i
lost
my
nerve
he
haunting
me
he
like
a
beast
of
prey
that
spanish
man
that
watching
at
the
cafe
de
la
paix
say
listen
and
i
tell
you
all
the
day
was
growing
dim
and
i
was
with
my
pernod
at
the
table
next
to
him
and
he
was
sitting
soberly
as
if
he
were
asleep
when
suddenly
he
seemed
to
tense
like
tiger
for
a
leap
and
then
he
swung
around
to
me
his
hand
went
to
his
hip
my
heart
was
beating
like
a
gong
my
arm
was
in
his
grip
his
eyes
were
glaring
into
mine
aye
though
i
shrank
with
fear
his
fetid
breath
was
on
my
face
his
voice
was
in
my
ear
excuse
my
he
hissed
but
sir
do
you
suppose
that
portly
man
who
passed
us
had
a
upon
his
nose
and
then
at
last
it
dawned
on
me
the
fellow
must
be
mad
and
when
i
soothingly
replied
i
do
not
think
he
had
the
little
wizened
spanish
man
subsided
in
his
chair
and
shrouded
in
his
raven
cloak
resumed
his
owlish
stare
but
when
i
tried
to
slip
away
he
turned
and
glared
at
me
and
oh
that
fishlike
face
of
his
was
sinister
to
see
forgive
me
if
i
startled
you
of
course
you
think
i
queer
no
doubt
you
wonder
who
i
am
so
solitary
here
you
question
why
the
i
piercingly
review
well
listen
my
bibacious
friend
i
tell
my
tale
to
you
it
happened
twenty
years
ago
and
in
another
land
a
maiden
young
and
beautiful
two
suitors
for
her
hand
my
rival
was
the
lucky
one
i
vowed
i
would
repay
revenge
has
mellowed
in
my
heart
it
rotten
ripe
my
happy
rival
skipped
away
vamoosed
he
left
no
trace
and
so
i
waiting
waiting
here
to
meet
him
face
to
face
for
has
it
not
been
ever
said
that
all
the
world
one
day
will
pass
in
pilgrimage
before
the
cafe
de
la
paix
but
sir
i
made
remonstrance
if
it
twenty
years
ago
you
scarcely
recognize
him
now
he
must
have
altered
so
the
little
wizened
spanish
man
he
laughed
a
hideous
laugh
and
from
his
cloak
he
quickly
drew
a
faded
photograph
you
right
said
he
but
there
are
traits
oh
this
you
must
allow
that
never
change
lopez
was
fat
he
must
be
fatter
now
his
paunch
is
senatorial
he
can
not
see
his
toes
i
sure
of
it
and
then
behold
that
wen
upon
his
nose
i
looking
for
a
man
like
that
i
wait
and
wait
until
what
will
you
do
i
sharply
cried
he
answered
me
why
kill
he
robbed
me
of
my
happiness
nay
stranger
do
not
start
i
firmly
and
politely
put
a
bullet
in
his
heart
and
then
that
little
spanish
man
with
big
cigar
alight
uprose
and
shook
my
trembling
hand
and
vanished
in
the
night
and
i
went
home
and
thought
of
him
and
had
a
dreadful
dream
of
portly
men
with
each
a
wen
and
woke
up
with
a
scream
and
sure
enough
next
morning
as
i
prowled
the
boulevard
a
portly
man
with
wenny
nose
roamed
into
my
regard
then
like
a
flash
i
ran
to
him
and
clutched
him
by
the
arm
oh
sir
said
i
i
do
not
wish
to
see
you
come
to
harm
but
if
your
life
you
value
aught
i
beg
entreat
and
pray
do
pass
before
the
terrace
of
the
cafe
de
la
paix
that
portly
man
he
looked
at
me
with
such
a
startled
air
then
bolted
like
a
rabbit
down
the
rue
michaudière
ha
ha
i
saved
a
life
i
thought
and
laughed
in
my
relief
and
straightway
joined
the
spanish
man
his
and
thus
each
day
i
dodged
about
and
kept
the
strictest
guard
for
portly
men
with
each
a
wen
upon
the
boulevard
and
then
i
hailed
my
spanish
pal
and
sitting
in
the
sun
we
ordered
many
pernods
and
we
drank
them
every
one
and
sternly
he
would
stare
and
stare
until
my
hand
would
shake
and
grimly
he
would
glare
and
glare
until
my
heart
would
quake
and
i
would
say
alphonso
lad
i
must
expostulate
why
keep
alive
for
twenty
years
the
furnace
of
your
hate
perhaps
his
wedded
life
was
hell
and
you
at
least
are
free
that
where
you
got
it
wrong
he
snarled
the
fool
she
took
was
my
rival
sneaked
threw
up
the
sponge
betrayed
himself
a
churl
was
he
who
got
the
happiness
i
only
got
the
girl
with
that
he
looked
so
he
made
me
creep
and
shrink
and
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
but
buy
another
drink
now
yonder
like
a
blot
of
ink
he
sits
across
the
way
upon
the
smiling
terrace
of
the
cafe
de
la
paix
that
little
wizened
spanish
man
his
face
is
ghastly
white
his
eyes
are
staring
staring
like
a
tiger
in
the
night
i
know
within
his
evil
heart
the
fires
of
hate
are
fanned
i
know
his
automatic
ready
waiting
to
his
hand
i
know
a
tragedy
is
near
i
dread
i
have
no
peace
oh
do
you
think
i
ought
to
go
and
call
upon
the
police
look
there
he
rising
up
my
god
he
leaps
from
out
his
place
yon
millionaire
from
argentine
the
two
are
face
to
face
a
shot
a
shriek
a
heavy
fall
a
huddled
heap
oh
see
the
little
wizened
spanish
man
is
dancing
in
his
i
sick
i
faint
i
going
oh
please
take
me
away
there
blood
upon
the
terrace
of
the
cafe
de
la
and
now
i
leave
my
work
and
sally
forth
the
city
is
join
the
crowd
and
laugh
and
sing
with
the
best
the
sunshine
seeks
my
little
room
to
tell
me
paris
streets
are
gay
that
children
cry
the
lily
bloom
all
up
and
down
the
leafy
way
that
half
the
town
is
mad
with
may
with
flame
of
flag
and
boom
of
bell
for
carnival
is
king
so
pen
and
page
awhile
farewell
book
two
early
summer
i
parc
montsouris
june
the
release
within
a
near
i
saw
a
newly
captured
linnet
who
beat
against
his
cage
in
fear
and
fell
exhausted
every
minute
and
when
i
asked
the
fellow
there
if
he
to
sell
the
bird
were
willing
he
told
me
with
a
careless
air
that
i
could
have
it
for
a
shilling
and
so
i
bought
it
cage
and
all
although
i
went
without
my
dinner
and
where
some
trees
were
fairly
tall
and
houses
shrank
and
smoke
was
thinner
the
tiny
door
i
open
threw
as
down
upon
the
grass
i
sank
me
poor
little
chap
how
quick
he
flew
he
did
even
wait
to
thank
me
life
like
a
cage
we
beat
the
bars
we
bruise
our
breasts
we
struggle
vainly
up
to
the
glory
of
the
stars
we
strain
with
flutterings
ungainly
and
then
god
opens
wide
the
door
our
wondrous
wings
are
arched
for
flying
we
poise
we
part
we
sing
we
soar
light
freedom
fools
call
it
dying
yes
that
wretched
little
bird
haunted
me
i
had
to
let
it
go
since
i
have
seized
my
own
liberty
i
am
a
fanatic
for
freedom
it
is
now
a
year
ago
i
launched
on
my
great
adventure
i
have
had
hard
times
been
hungry
cold
weary
i
have
worked
harder
than
ever
i
did
and
discouragement
has
slapped
me
on
the
face
yet
the
year
has
been
the
happiest
of
my
life
and
all
because
i
am
free
by
reason
of
filthy
money
no
one
can
say
to
me
do
this
or
do
that
master
does
exist
in
my
vocabulary
i
can
look
any
man
in
the
face
and
tell
him
to
go
to
the
devil
i
belong
to
myself
i
am
not
for
sale
it
glorious
to
feel
like
that
it
sweetens
the
dry
crust
and
warms
the
heart
in
the
icy
wind
for
that
i
will
hunger
and
go
threadbare
for
that
i
will
live
austerely
and
deny
myself
all
pleasure
after
health
the
best
thing
in
life
is
freedom
here
is
the
last
of
my
ballads
it
is
by
way
of
being
an
experiment
its
theme
is
commonplace
its
language
that
of
everyday
it
is
a
bit
of
realism
in
rhyme
the
wee
shop
she
risked
her
all
they
told
me
bravely
sinking
the
pinched
economies
of
thirty
years
and
there
the
little
shop
was
meek
and
shrinking
the
sum
of
all
her
dreams
and
hopes
and
fears
ere
it
was
opened
i
would
see
them
in
it
the
dame
the
daughter
with
her
crutch
so
fond
so
happy
hoarding
every
minute
like
artists
for
the
final
tender
touch
the
opening
day
i
sure
that
to
their
seeming
was
never
shop
so
wonderful
as
theirs
with
pyramids
of
rubbed
to
gleaming
such
vivid
cans
of
peaches
prunes
and
pears
and
chocolate
and
biscuits
in
glass
cases
and
bottles
and
bright
yet
nothing
half
so
radiant
as
their
faces
their
eyes
of
hope
excitement
and
delight
i
entered
how
they
waited
all
how
awkwardly
they
weighed
my
and
then
with
all
the
thanks
a
tongue
could
utter
they
bowed
me
from
the
kindliest
of
shops
i
sure
that
night
their
customers
they
numbered
discussed
them
all
in
happy
breathless
speech
and
though
quite
worn
and
weary
ere
they
slumbered
sent
heavenward
a
little
prayer
for
each
and
so
i
watched
with
interest
redoubled
that
little
shop
spent
in
it
all
i
had
and
when
i
saw
it
empty
i
was
troubled
and
when
i
saw
them
busy
i
was
glad
and
when
i
dared
to
ask
how
things
were
going
they
told
me
with
a
fine
and
gallant
smile
not
badly
slow
at
first
there
never
knowing
surely
pick
up
in
a
little
while
i
often
see
them
through
the
winter
weather
behind
the
shutters
by
a
light
faint
speck
poring
books
their
faces
close
together
the
lame
girl
arm
around
her
mother
neck
they
dressed
their
windows
not
one
time
but
twenty
each
change
more
pinched
more
desperately
neat
alas
i
wondered
if
behind
that
plenty
the
two
who
owned
it
had
enough
to
eat
ah
who
would
dare
to
sing
of
tea
and
coffee
the
sadness
of
a
stock
unsold
and
dead
the
petty
tragedy
of
melting
toffee
the
sordid
pathos
of
stale
gingerbread
ignoble
themes
and
yet
those
haggard
faces
within
that
little
oh
here
i
say
one
does
not
need
to
look
in
lofty
places
for
tragic
themes
they
round
us
every
day
and
so
i
saw
their
agony
their
fighting
their
eyes
of
fear
their
heartbreak
their
despair
and
there
the
little
shop
is
black
and
blighting
and
all
the
world
goes
by
and
does
not
care
they
say
she
sought
her
old
employer
pity
content
to
take
the
pittance
he
would
give
the
lame
girl
yes
she
working
in
the
city
she
coughs
a
lot
she
has
long
to
live
last
night
macbean
introduced
me
to
saxon
dane
the
poet
truly
he
is
more
like
a
blacksmith
than
a
bard
a
big
bearded
man
whose
black
eyes
brood
somberly
or
flash
with
sudden
fire
we
talked
of
walt
whitman
and
then
of
others
the
trouble
with
poetry
he
said
is
that
it
is
too
exalted
it
has
a
phraseology
of
its
own
it
selects
themes
that
are
quite
outside
of
ordinary
experience
as
a
medium
of
expression
it
fails
to
reach
the
great
mass
of
the
people
then
he
added
to
hell
with
the
great
mass
of
the
people
what
have
they
got
to
do
with
it
write
to
please
yourself
as
if
not
a
single
reader
existed
the
moment
a
man
begins
to
be
conscious
of
an
audience
he
is
artistically
damned
you
not
a
poet
i
hope
i
meekly
assured
him
i
was
a
mere
maker
of
verse
well
said
he
better
good
verse
than
middling
poetry
and
maybe
even
the
humblest
of
rhymes
has
its
uses
happiness
is
happiness
whether
it
be
inspired
by
a
rossetti
sonnet
or
a
ballad
by
sims
let
each
one
who
has
something
to
say
say
it
in
the
best
way
he
can
and
abide
the
after
all
he
went
on
what
does
it
matter
we
are
living
in
a
pygmy
day
with
tennyson
and
browning
the
line
of
great
poets
passed
away
perhaps
for
ever
the
world
is
full
of
little
minstrels
who
echo
one
another
and
who
pipe
away
tunefully
enough
but
with
one
exception
they
do
not
matter
i
dared
to
ask
who
was
his
one
exception
he
answered
myself
of
course
here
a
bit
of
light
verse
which
it
amused
me
to
write
as
i
sat
in
the
sun
on
the
terrace
of
the
closerie
de
lilas
the
philistine
and
the
bohemian
she
was
a
philistine
spick
and
span
he
was
a
bold
bohemian
she
had
the
and
the
last
at
that
he
had
a
cape
and
a
brigand
hat
she
was
so
and
and
trim
he
was
so
shaggy
unkempt
and
grim
on
the
rue
de
la
paix
she
was
wont
to
shine
the
rue
de
la
gaîté
was
more
his
line
she
doted
on
barclay
and
dell
and
caine
he
quoted
mallarmé
and
paul
verlaine
she
was
a
triumph
at
tango
teas
at
vorticist
suppers
he
sought
to
please
she
thought
that
franz
lehar
was
utterly
great
of
strauss
and
stravinsky
he
piously
prate
she
loved
elegance
he
loved
art
they
were
as
wide
as
the
poles
apart
yet
cupid
and
caprice
are
hand
and
glove
they
met
at
a
dinner
they
fell
in
love
home
he
went
to
his
garret
bare
thrilling
with
rapture
hope
despair
swift
he
gazed
in
his
made
a
grimace
and
murmured
ass
seized
his
scissors
and
fiercely
sheared
severed
his
buccaneering
beard
grabbed
his
hair
and
clip
clip
clip
off
came
a
bunch
with
every
snip
ran
to
a
tailor
in
startled
state
suits
a
dozen
commanded
straight
coats
and
overcoats
pants
in
pairs
everything
that
a
dandy
wears
socks
and
collars
and
shoes
and
ties
everything
that
a
dandy
buys
chums
looked
at
him
with
wondering
stare
fancied
they
seen
him
before
somewhere
a
brummell
a
a
so
fine
a
shining
immaculate
philistine
home
she
went
in
a
raptured
daze
looked
in
a
mirror
with
startled
gaze
did
seem
to
be
pleased
at
all
savagely
muttered
insipid
doll
clutched
her
hair
and
a
pair
of
shears
cropped
and
bobbed
it
behind
the
ears
aimed
at
a
wan
and
sort
of
a
holman
hunt
effect
robed
in
subtile
and
tones
like
the
dames
of
rossetti
and
girdled
her
garments
billowing
wide
moved
with
an
undulating
glide
all
her
frivolous
friends
forsook
cultivated
a
soulful
look
gushed
in
a
voice
with
a
creamy
throb
over
some
weirdly
futurist
daub
did
all
in
short
that
a
woman
can
to
be
a
consummate
bohemian
a
year
went
past
with
its
hopes
and
fears
a
year
that
seemed
like
a
dozen
years
they
met
once
oh
at
last
at
last
they
rushed
together
they
stopped
aghast
they
looked
at
each
other
with
blank
dismay
they
simply
had
a
word
to
say
he
thought
with
a
shiver
can
this
be
she
she
thought
with
a
shudder
this
ca
be
he
this
simpering
dandy
so
sleek
and
spruce
this
languorous
lily
in
garments
loose
they
sought
to
brace
from
the
awful
shock
taking
a
seat
they
tried
to
talk
she
spoke
of
bergson
and
pater
prose
he
prattled
of
dances
and
ragtime
shows
she
purred
of
pictures
matisse
cezanne
his
tastes
to
the
girls
of
kirchner
ran
she
raved
of
tchaikovsky
and
caesar
franck
he
owned
that
he
was
a
crank
they
made
no
headway
alas
alas
he
thought
her
a
bore
she
thought
him
an
ass
and
so
they
arose
and
hurriedly
fled
perish
illusion
romance
you
dead
he
loved
elegance
she
loved
art
better
at
once
to
part
to
part
and
what
is
the
moral
of
all
this
rot
do
try
to
be
what
you
know
you
not
and
if
you
made
on
a
muttonish
plan
do
seek
to
seem
a
bohemian
and
if
to
the
goats
your
feet
incline
do
try
to
pass
for
a
philistine
ii
a
small
cafe
in
a
side
street
june
the
bohemian
dreams
because
my
overcoat
in
pawn
i
choose
to
take
my
glass
within
a
little
on
the
rue
du
montparnasse
the
dusty
bins
with
bottles
shine
the
counter
lined
with
zinc
and
there
i
sit
and
drink
my
wine
and
think
and
think
and
think
i
think
of
hoary
old
stamboul
of
moslem
and
of
greek
of
persian
in
coat
of
wool
of
kurd
and
arab
sheikh
of
all
the
types
of
weal
and
woe
and
as
i
raise
my
glass
across
galata
bridge
i
know
they
pass
and
pass
and
pass
i
think
of
aglow
of
shading
down
of
sailors
dancing
heel
and
toe
with
wenches
black
and
brown
and
though
it
all
an
ocean
far
from
yucatan
to
france
i
bet
beside
the
old
bazaar
they
dance
and
dance
and
dance
i
think
of
monte
carlo
where
the
pallid
croupiers
call
and
in
the
gorgeous
guilty
air
the
gamblers
watch
the
ball
and
as
i
flick
away
the
foam
with
which
my
beer
is
crowned
the
wheels
beneath
the
gilded
dome
go
round
and
round
and
round
i
think
of
vast
niagara
those
gulfs
of
foam
whose
mighty
roar
would
stagger
a
more
prosy
bean
than
mine
and
as
the
hours
i
idly
spend
against
a
greasy
wall
i
know
that
green
the
waters
bend
and
fall
and
fall
and
fall
i
think
of
nijni
novgorod
and
jews
who
never
rest
and
womenfolk
with
spade
and
hod
who
slave
in
of
squat
and
sturdy
japanese
who
pound
the
paddy
soil
and
as
i
loaf
and
smoke
at
ease
they
toil
and
toil
and
toil
i
think
of
shrines
in
hindustan
of
cloistral
glooms
in
spain
of
minarets
in
ispahan
of
sophia
fane
of
convent
towers
in
palestine
of
temples
in
cathay
and
as
i
stretch
and
sip
my
wine
they
pray
and
pray
and
pray
and
so
my
dreams
i
dwell
within
and
visions
come
and
go
and
life
is
passing
like
a
ematographic
show
till
just
as
surely
as
my
pipe
is
underneath
my
nose
amid
my
visions
rich
and
ripe
i
doze
and
doze
and
doze
alas
it
is
too
true
once
more
i
am
counting
the
coppers
living
on
the
ragged
edge
my
manuscripts
come
back
to
me
like
boomerangs
and
i
have
not
the
postage
far
less
the
heart
to
send
them
out
again
macbean
seems
to
take
an
interest
in
my
struggles
i
often
sit
in
his
room
in
the
rue
smoking
and
sipping
whisky
into
the
small
hours
he
is
an
old
hand
who
knows
the
market
and
frankly
manufactures
for
it
give
me
short
pieces
he
says
things
of
three
verses
that
will
fill
a
blank
of
a
magazine
let
them
be
sprightly
and
if
possible
have
a
snapper
at
the
end
give
me
that
sort
of
article
i
think
i
can
place
it
for
you
then
he
looked
through
a
lot
of
my
verse
this
is
the
kind
of
stuff
i
might
be
able
to
sell
he
said
a
domestic
tragedy
clorinda
met
me
on
the
way
as
i
came
from
the
train
her
face
was
anything
but
gay
in
fact
suggested
pain
oh
hubby
hubby
dear
she
cried
i
awful
news
to
what
is
it
darling
i
replied
your
mother
is
she
well
oh
no
oh
no
it
is
not
that
it
something
else
she
wailed
my
heart
was
beating
my
ruddy
visage
paled
like
lightning
flash
in
heaven
dome
the
fear
within
me
woke
do
say
i
cried
our
little
home
has
all
gone
up
in
smoke
she
shook
her
head
oh
swift
i
clasped
and
held
her
to
my
breast
the
children
tell
me
quick
i
gasped
believe
me
it
is
best
then
then
she
spoke
sobs
i
caught
these
words
of
woe
divine
it
has
gone
and
bought
new
hat
just
like
at
present
i
am
living
on
bread
and
milk
by
doing
this
i
can
rub
along
for
another
ten
days
the
thought
pleases
me
as
long
as
i
have
a
crust
i
am
master
of
my
destiny
some
day
when
i
am
rich
and
famous
i
shall
look
back
on
all
this
with
regret
yet
i
think
i
shall
always
remain
a
bohemian
i
hate
regularity
the
clock
was
never
made
for
me
i
want
to
eat
when
i
am
hungry
sleep
when
i
am
weary
drink
well
any
old
time
i
prefer
to
be
alone
company
is
a
constraint
on
my
spirit
i
never
make
an
engagement
if
i
can
avoid
it
to
do
so
is
to
put
a
mortgage
on
my
future
i
like
to
be
able
to
rise
in
the
morning
with
the
thought
that
the
hours
before
me
are
all
mine
to
spend
in
my
own
way
to
work
to
dream
to
watch
the
unfolding
drama
of
life
here
is
another
of
my
ballads
it
is
longer
than
most
and
gave
me
more
trouble
though
none
the
better
for
that
the
pencil
seller
a
pencil
sir
a
penny
wo
you
buy
i
cold
and
wet
and
tired
a
sorry
plight
do
turn
your
back
sir
take
one
just
to
try
i
have
made
a
single
sale
oh
thank
you
sir
but
take
the
pencil
too
i
not
a
beggar
i
a
business
man
pencils
i
deal
in
red
and
black
and
blue
it
hard
but
still
i
do
the
best
i
can
most
days
i
make
enough
to
pay
for
bread
a
cup
o
coffee
stretching
room
at
night
one
needs
so
little
to
be
warm
and
fed
a
hole
to
kennel
in
oh
one
all
right
excuse
me
you
a
painter
are
you
not
i
saw
you
looking
at
that
dealer
show
the
he
has
for
sale
a
shabby
lot
what
do
i
know
of
art
what
do
i
know
well
look
that
david
strong
so
well
displayed
white
sorcery
it
called
all
gossamer
and
pale
and
a
dancing
maid
you
like
the
little
elfin
face
of
her
that
good
but
still
the
picture
as
a
whole
the
values
pah
he
never
painted
worse
perhaps
because
his
fire
was
lacking
coal
his
cupboard
bare
no
money
in
his
purse
perhaps
they
say
he
labored
hard
and
long
and
see
now
in
the
harvest
of
his
fame
when
round
his
pictures
people
gape
and
throng
a
scurvy
dealer
sells
this
on
his
name
a
wretched
rag
wrung
out
of
want
and
woe
a
soulless
daub
not
david
strong
a
bit
unworthy
of
his
how
should
i
know
how
should
i
know
i
i
painted
it
there
now
i
did
mean
to
let
that
out
it
came
in
spite
of
me
aye
stare
and
stare
you
think
i
lying
crazy
drunk
no
doubt
think
what
you
like
it
neither
here
nor
there
it
hard
to
tell
so
terrible
a
truth
to
gain
to
glory
yet
be
such
as
i
it
true
that
picture
mine
done
in
my
youth
up
in
a
garret
near
the
paris
sky
the
child
my
daughter
aye
she
posed
for
me
that
why
i
come
and
sit
here
every
night
the
painting
bad
but
still
oh
still
i
see
her
little
face
all
laughing
in
the
light
so
now
you
i
live
in
fear
lest
one
like
you
should
carry
it
away
a
poor
thing
but
oh
how
dear
do
let
them
buy
it
pitying
god
i
pray
and
hark
ye
sir
sometimes
my
brain
awhirl
some
night
i
crash
into
that
window
pane
and
snatch
my
picture
back
my
little
girl
and
run
and
i
talking
wild
again
a
crab
ca
run
i
crippled
withered
lame
palsied
as
good
as
dead
all
down
one
side
no
warning
had
i
when
the
evil
came
it
struck
me
down
in
all
my
strength
and
pride
triumph
was
mine
i
thrilled
with
perfect
power
honor
was
mine
fame
laurel
touched
my
brow
glory
was
mine
within
a
little
hour
i
was
a
god
and
what
you
find
me
now
my
child
that
little
laughing
girl
you
see
she
was
my
nurse
for
all
ten
weary
years
her
joy
her
hope
her
youth
she
gave
for
me
her
very
smiles
were
masks
to
hide
her
tears
and
i
my
precious
art
so
rich
so
rare
lost
lost
to
me
what
could
my
heart
but
break
oh
as
i
lay
and
wrestled
with
despair
i
would
have
killed
myself
but
for
her
by
luck
i
had
some
pictures
i
could
sell
and
so
we
fought
the
wolf
back
from
the
door
she
painted
too
aye
wonderfully
well
we
often
dreamed
of
brighter
days
in
store
and
then
quite
suddenly
she
seemed
to
fail
i
saw
the
shadows
darken
round
her
eyes
so
tired
she
was
so
sorrowful
so
pale
and
oh
there
came
a
day
she
could
not
rise
the
doctor
looked
at
her
he
shook
his
head
and
spoke
of
wine
and
grapes
and
southern
air
if
you
can
get
her
out
of
this
he
said
she
have
a
fighting
chance
with
proper
care
with
proper
care
when
he
had
gone
away
i
sat
there
trembling
twitching
dazed
with
grief
under
my
old
and
ragged
coat
she
lay
our
room
was
bare
and
cold
beyond
belief
maybe
i
thought
i
still
can
paint
a
bit
some
lilies
landscape
anything
at
all
alas
my
brush
i
could
not
steady
it
down
from
my
fumbling
hand
i
let
it
fall
with
proper
care
how
could
i
give
her
that
half
of
me
dead
i
crawled
down
to
the
street
cowering
beside
the
wall
i
held
my
hat
and
begged
of
every
one
i
chanced
to
meet
i
got
some
pennies
bought
her
milk
and
bread
and
so
i
fought
to
keep
the
doom
away
and
yet
i
saw
with
agony
of
dread
my
dear
one
sinking
sinking
day
by
day
and
then
i
was
awakened
in
the
night
please
take
my
hands
i
cold
i
heard
her
sigh
and
soft
she
whispered
as
she
held
me
tight
oh
daddy
we
been
happy
you
and
i
i
do
not
think
she
suffered
any
pain
she
breathed
so
quietly
but
though
i
tried
i
could
not
warm
her
little
hands
again
and
so
there
in
the
icy
dark
she
the
dawn
came
groping
in
with
fingers
gray
and
touched
me
sitting
silent
as
a
stone
i
kissed
those
piteous
lips
as
cold
as
clay
i
did
not
cry
i
did
not
even
moan
at
last
i
rose
groped
down
the
narrow
stair
an
evil
fog
was
oozing
from
the
sky
i
stumbled
on
i
knew
not
where
like
phantoms
were
the
folks
that
passed
me
by
how
long
i
wandered
thus
i
do
not
know
but
suddenly
i
halted
stood
beside
a
door
that
spilled
a
golden
glow
i
saw
a
name
upon
a
bill
a
sale
of
famous
pictures
so
it
read
a
notable
collection
each
a
gem
distinguished
works
of
art
by
painters
dead
the
folks
were
going
in
i
followed
them
i
stood
upon
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
i
only
hoped
that
none
might
notice
me
soon
soon
i
heard
them
call
my
name
aloud
a
strong
his
in
a
brave
big
picture
that
the
best
i
done
it
glowed
and
kindled
half
the
hall
away
with
all
its
memories
of
sea
and
sun
of
pipe
and
bowl
of
joyous
work
and
play
i
saw
the
sardine
nets
blue
as
the
sky
i
saw
the
put
out
five
hundred
pounds
rapped
out
a
voice
near
by
six
hundred
seven
eight
and
then
a
shout
a
thousand
pounds
oh
how
i
thrilled
to
hear
oh
how
the
bids
went
up
by
leaps
by
bounds
and
then
a
silence
then
the
auctioneer
it
going
going
gone
thousand
pounds
three
thousand
pounds
a
frenzy
leapt
in
me
that
picture
mine
i
cried
i
david
strong
i
painted
it
this
famished
wretch
you
see
i
did
it
i
and
sold
it
for
a
song
and
in
a
garret
three
small
hours
ago
my
daughter
died
for
want
of
christian
care
look
look
at
me
is
it
to
mock
my
woe
you
pay
three
thousand
for
my
picture
there
o
god
i
stumbled
blindly
from
the
hall
the
city
crashed
on
me
the
fiendish
sounds
of
cruelty
and
strife
but
over
all
three
thousand
pounds
i
heard
three
thousand
pounds
there
that
my
story
sir
it
is
gay
tales
of
the
poor
are
never
very
bright
you
look
for
me
next
time
you
pass
this
way
i
hope
you
find
me
sir
iii
the
luxembourg
june
on
a
late
afternoon
when
the
sunlight
is
mellow
on
the
leaves
i
often
sit
near
the
fontaine
de
medicis
and
watch
the
children
at
their
play
sometimes
i
make
bits
of
verse
about
them
such
as
in
bed
up
into
the
sky
i
stare
all
the
little
stars
i
see
and
i
know
that
god
is
there
o
how
lonely
he
must
be
me
i
laugh
and
leap
all
day
till
my
head
begins
to
nod
he
so
great
he
can
not
play
i
am
glad
i
am
not
god
poor
kind
god
upon
his
throne
up
there
in
the
sky
so
blue
always
always
all
alone
dear
god
i
pity
or
else
sitting
on
the
terrace
of
a
cafe
on
the
boul
mich
i
sip
slowly
a
dubonnet
or
a
byrrh
and
the
charm
of
the
quarter
possesses
me
i
think
of
men
who
have
lived
and
loved
there
who
have
groveled
and
gloried
who
have
drunk
deep
and
died
and
then
i
scribble
things
like
this
gods
in
the
gutter
i
dreamed
i
saw
three
who
in
a
cafe
sat
and
one
was
small
and
crapulous
and
one
was
large
and
fat
and
one
was
eaten
up
with
vice
and
verminous
at
that
the
first
he
spoke
of
secret
sins
and
gems
and
perfumes
rare
and
velvet
cats
and
courtesans
voluptuously
fair
who
is
the
sybarite
i
asked
they
answered
baudelaire
the
second
talked
in
tapestries
by
fantasy
beguiled
as
frail
as
bubbles
hard
as
gems
his
pageantries
he
piled
this
lord
of
language
who
is
he
they
whispered
oscar
wilde
the
third
was
staring
at
his
glass
from
out
abysmal
pain
with
tears
his
eyes
were
bitten
in
beneath
his
bulbous
brain
who
is
the
sodden
wretch
i
said
they
told
me
paul
verlaine
oh
wilde
verlaine
and
baudelaire
their
lips
were
wet
with
wine
oh
poseur
pimp
and
libertine
oh
cynic
sot
and
swine
oh
votaries
of
velvet
vice
oh
gods
of
light
divine
oh
baudelaire
verlaine
and
wilde
they
knew
the
sinks
of
shame
their
wings
they
scorched
at
passion
altar
flame
yet
lo
enthroned
enskied
they
stand
immortal
sons
of
fame
i
dreamed
i
saw
three
who
walked
with
feet
of
clay
with
cruel
crosses
on
their
backs
along
a
miry
way
who
climbed
and
climbed
the
bitter
steep
to
which
men
turn
and
pray
and
while
i
am
on
the
subject
of
the
quarter
let
me
repeat
this
which
is
included
in
my
ballads
of
the
boulevards
the
death
of
marie
toro
we
taking
marie
toro
to
her
home
in
we
taking
marie
toro
to
her
last
behold
her
hearse
is
hung
with
wreaths
till
everything
is
hid
except
the
blossoms
heaping
high
upon
her
coffin
lid
a
week
ago
she
roamed
the
street
a
draggle
and
a
slut
a
of
the
boulevard
and
everybody
butt
a
week
ago
she
haunted
us
we
heard
her
whining
cry
we
brushed
aside
the
broken
blooms
she
pestered
us
to
buy
a
week
ago
she
had
not
where
to
rest
her
weary
head
but
now
oh
follow
follow
on
for
marie
toro
dead
oh
marie
she
was
once
a
queen
ah
yes
a
queen
of
queens
above
the
carnival
she
held
her
splendid
sway
for
crashing
hours
she
knew
what
glory
means
the
cheers
of
half
a
million
throats
the
of
a
day
yet
she
was
only
one
of
us
a
little
though
far
the
loveliest
and
best
of
all
our
laughing
band
then
fortune
beckoned
off
she
danced
amid
the
dizzy
whirl
and
we
who
once
might
kiss
her
cheek
were
proud
to
kiss
her
hand
for
swiftly
as
a
star
she
soared
she
had
her
every
wish
we
saw
her
roped
with
pearls
of
price
with
princes
at
her
call
and
yet
and
yet
i
think
her
dreams
were
of
the
old
boul
mich
and
yet
i
sure
within
her
heart
she
loved
us
best
of
all
for
one
night
in
the
purple
pig
upon
the
rue
we
laughed
and
quaffed
a
limousine
came
swishing
to
the
door
then
raymond
jolicoeur
cried
out
it
queen
marie
come
back
in
satin
clad
to
make
us
glad
and
witch
our
hearts
once
more
but
no
her
face
was
strangely
sad
and
at
the
evening
end
dear
lads
she
said
i
love
you
all
and
when
i
far
away
remember
oh
remember
little
marie
is
your
friend
and
though
the
world
may
lie
between
i
coming
back
some
day
and
so
she
went
and
many
a
boy
who
fought
his
way
to
fame
can
look
back
on
the
struggle
of
his
garret
days
and
bless
the
loyal
heart
the
tender
hand
the
providence
that
came
to
him
and
all
in
hour
of
need
in
sickness
and
distress
time
passed
away
she
won
their
hearts
in
london
moscow
rome
they
worshiped
her
in
argentine
adored
her
in
brazil
we
smoked
our
pipes
and
wondered
when
she
might
be
coming
home
and
then
we
learned
the
luck
had
turned
the
things
were
going
ill
her
health
had
failed
her
beauty
paled
her
lovers
fled
away
and
some
one
saw
her
in
peru
a
common
drab
at
last
so
years
went
by
and
faces
changed
our
beards
were
sadly
gray
and
marie
toro
name
became
an
echo
of
the
past
you
know
that
old
and
withered
man
that
derelict
of
art
who
for
a
paltry
franc
will
make
a
crayon
sketch
of
you
in
slouching
hat
and
shabby
cloak
he
looks
and
is
the
part
a
sodden
old
bohemian
without
a
single
a
boon
companion
of
the
days
of
rimbaud
and
verlaine
he
broods
and
broods
and
chews
the
cud
of
bitter
souvenirs
beneath
his
mop
of
grizzled
hair
his
cheeks
are
gouged
with
pain
the
saffron
sockets
of
his
eyes
are
hollowed
out
with
tears
well
one
night
in
the
din
i
saw
him
in
his
place
when
suddenly
the
door
was
swung
a
woman
halted
there
a
woman
cowering
like
a
dog
with
white
and
haggard
face
a
broken
creature
bent
of
spine
a
daughter
of
despair
she
looked
and
looked
as
to
her
breast
she
held
some
withered
bloom
too
late
too
late
they
all
are
dead
and
gone
i
heard
her
say
and
once
again
her
weary
eyes
went
round
and
round
the
room
not
one
of
all
i
used
to
know
she
turned
to
go
away
but
quick
i
saw
the
old
man
start
ah
no
he
cried
not
all
oh
marie
toro
queen
of
queens
do
you
remember
paul
oh
marie
marie
toro
in
my
garret
next
the
sky
where
many
a
day
and
night
i
crouched
with
not
a
crust
to
eat
a
picture
hangs
upon
the
wall
a
fortune
could
buy
a
portrait
of
a
girl
whose
face
is
pure
and
sadly
the
woman
looked
at
him
alas
it
true
she
said
that
little
maid
i
knew
her
once
it
long
ago
she
dead
he
went
to
her
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
wasted
arm
oh
marie
toro
come
with
me
though
poor
and
sick
am
i
for
old
times
sake
i
can
not
bear
to
see
you
come
to
harm
ah
there
are
memories
god
knows
that
never
never
too
late
she
sighed
i
lived
my
life
of
splendor
and
of
shame
i
been
adored
by
men
of
power
i
touched
the
highest
height
i
squandered
gold
like
heaps
of
dirt
oh
i
have
played
the
game
i
had
my
place
within
the
sun
and
now
i
face
the
night
look
look
you
see
i
lost
to
hope
i
live
no
matter
how
to
drink
and
drink
and
so
forget
that
all
i
care
for
now
and
so
she
went
her
heedless
way
and
all
our
help
was
vain
she
trailed
along
with
tattered
shawl
and
skirt
she
gnawed
a
crust
and
slept
beneath
the
bridges
of
the
seine
a
garbage
thing
a
composite
of
alcohol
and
dirt
the
students
learned
her
story
and
the
cafes
knew
her
well
the
pascal
and
the
panthéon
the
sufflot
and
vachette
she
shuffled
round
the
tables
with
the
flowers
she
tried
to
sell
a
living
mask
of
misery
that
no
one
will
forget
and
then
last
week
i
missed
her
and
they
found
her
in
the
street
one
morning
early
huddled
down
for
it
was
freezing
cold
but
when
they
raised
her
ragged
shawl
her
face
was
still
and
sweet
some
bits
of
broken
bloom
were
clutched
within
her
icy
hold
that
ah
yes
they
say
that
saw
her
blue
eyes
were
beautiful
with
joy
again
with
radiant
a
week
ago
she
begged
for
bread
we
bought
for
her
a
stone
and
a
peaceful
place
in
where
she
be
well
alone
she
cost
a
king
his
crown
they
say
oh
would
she
be
proud
if
she
could
see
the
wreaths
the
coaches
and
the
crowd
so
follow
follow
follow
on
with
slow
and
sober
tread
for
marie
toro
gutter
waif
and
queen
of
queens
is
dead
iv
the
cafe
de
deux
magots
june
the
bohemian
up
in
my
garret
bleak
and
bare
i
tilted
back
on
my
broken
chair
and
my
three
old
pals
were
with
me
there
hunger
and
thirst
and
cold
hunger
scowled
at
his
scurvy
mate
cold
cowered
down
by
the
hollow
grate
and
i
hated
them
with
a
deadly
hate
as
old
as
life
is
old
so
up
in
my
garret
that
near
the
sky
i
smiled
a
smile
that
was
thin
and
dry
you
roomed
with
me
twenty
year
said
i
hunger
and
thirst
and
cold
but
now
begone
down
the
broken
stair
i
suffered
enough
of
your
spite
so
there
bang
bang
i
slapped
on
the
table
bare
a
glittering
heap
of
gold
red
flames
will
jewel
my
wine
i
loose
my
belt
that
you
lugged
so
tight
ha
ha
dame
fortune
is
smiling
bright
the
stuff
of
my
brain
i
sold
of
the
gutter
up
away
you
battened
on
me
for
a
day
but
i
driving
you
forth
and
forever
and
aye
hunger
and
thirst
and
cold
so
i
kicked
them
out
with
a
scornful
roar
yet
oh
they
turned
at
the
garret
door
quietly
there
they
spoke
once
more
the
tale
is
not
all
told
it
but
it
not
we
yours
old
chap
till
the
day
you
die
laugh
on
you
fool
oh
you
never
defy
hunger
and
thirst
and
cold
hurrah
the
crisis
in
my
financial
career
is
over
once
more
i
have
weathered
the
storm
and
never
did
money
jingle
so
sweetly
in
my
pocket
it
was
macbean
who
delivered
me
he
arrived
at
the
door
of
my
garret
this
morning
with
a
broad
grin
of
pleasure
on
his
face
here
said
he
i
sold
some
of
your
rubbish
they
take
more
too
of
the
same
sort
with
that
he
handed
me
three
crisp
notes
for
a
moment
i
thought
that
he
was
paying
the
money
out
of
his
own
pocket
as
he
knew
i
was
desperately
hard
up
but
he
showed
me
the
letter
enclosing
the
cheque
he
had
cashed
for
me
so
we
sought
the
grand
boulevard
and
i
had
a
pernod
which
rose
to
my
head
in
delicious
waves
of
joy
i
talked
ecstatic
nonsense
and
seemed
to
walk
like
a
god
in
clouds
of
gold
we
dined
on
frogs
legs
and
vouvray
and
then
went
to
see
the
revue
at
the
marigny
a
very
merry
evening
such
is
the
life
of
bohemia
up
and
down
fast
and
feast
its
very
uncertainty
its
charm
here
is
my
latest
ballad
another
attempt
to
express
the
sentiment
of
actuality
the
auction
sale
her
little
head
just
topped
the
she
even
mounted
on
a
stool
maybe
she
pressed
against
the
pane
as
children
will
and
watched
us
playing
oh
so
wistfully
and
then
i
missed
her
for
a
month
or
more
and
idly
thought
she
gone
away
no
doubt
until
a
hearse
drew
up
beside
the
door
i
saw
a
tiny
coffin
carried
out
and
after
that
towards
dusk
i
often
see
behind
the
blind
another
face
that
looked
eyes
of
a
young
wife
watching
anxiously
then
rushing
back
to
where
her
dinner
cooked
she
often
gulped
it
down
alone
i
fear
within
her
heart
the
sadness
of
despair
for
near
to
midnight
i
would
vaguely
hear
a
lurching
step
a
stumbling
on
the
stair
these
little
dramas
of
the
common
day
a
man
and
to
fail
the
window
empty
now
they
gone
away
and
yonder
see
their
furniture
for
sale
to
all
the
world
their
door
is
open
wide
and
round
and
round
the
roam
and
peer
and
gloat
like
vultures
above
the
corpse
of
what
was
once
a
home
so
reverent
i
go
from
room
to
room
and
see
the
patient
care
the
tender
touch
the
love
that
sought
to
brighten
up
the
gloom
the
tested
overmuch
amid
those
things
so
intimate
and
dear
where
now
the
mob
invades
with
brutal
tread
i
think
what
happiness
is
buried
here
what
dreams
are
withered
and
what
hopes
are
dead
oh
woman
dear
and
were
you
sweet
and
glad
over
the
lining
of
your
little
nest
what
ponderings
and
proud
ideas
you
had
what
visions
of
a
shrine
of
peace
and
rest
for
there
his
upon
the
rug
his
his
on
the
wall
all
that
you
could
devise
to
make
him
snug
and
yet
you
could
not
hold
him
with
it
all
ah
patient
heart
what
homelike
joys
you
planned
to
stay
him
by
the
dull
domestic
flame
those
silken
cushions
that
you
worked
by
hand
when
you
had
time
before
the
baby
came
oh
how
you
wove
around
him
cozy
spells
and
schemed
so
hard
to
keep
him
home
of
nights
aye
every
touch
and
turn
some
story
tells
of
sweet
conspiracies
and
dead
delights
and
here
upon
the
scratched
piano
stool
tied
in
a
bundle
are
the
songs
you
sung
that
cozy
that
you
worked
in
colored
wool
the
spanish
lace
you
made
when
you
were
young
and
lots
of
modern
novels
cheap
reprints
and
little
dainty
everywhere
and
silken
bows
and
curtains
of
gay
chintz
oh
her
tiny
crib
her
folding
chair
sweet
woman
dear
and
did
your
heart
not
break
to
leave
this
precious
home
you
made
in
vain
poor
shabby
things
so
prized
for
old
times
sake
with
all
their
memories
of
love
and
pain
alas
while
shouts
the
raucous
auctioneer
and
dames
are
prying
everywhere
the
echo
of
old
joy
is
all
i
hear
all
all
i
see
just
heartbreak
and
despair
imagination
is
the
great
gift
of
the
gods
given
it
one
does
not
need
to
look
afar
for
subjects
there
is
romance
in
every
face
those
who
have
imagination
live
in
a
land
of
enchantment
which
the
eyes
of
others
can
not
see
yet
if
it
brings
marvelous
joy
it
also
brings
exquisite
pain
who
lives
a
hundred
lives
must
die
a
hundred
deaths
i
do
not
know
any
of
the
people
who
live
around
me
sometimes
i
pass
them
on
the
stairs
however
i
am
going
to
give
my
imagination
rein
and
string
some
rhymes
about
them
before
doing
so
having
money
in
my
pocket
and
seeing
the
prospect
of
making
more
let
me
blithely
chant
about
the
joy
of
being
poor
i
let
others
sing
of
gold
and
gear
the
joy
of
being
rich
but
oh
the
days
when
i
was
poor
a
vagrant
in
a
ditch
when
every
dawn
was
like
a
gem
so
radiant
and
rare
and
i
had
but
a
single
coat
and
not
a
single
care
when
i
would
feast
right
royally
on
bacon
bread
and
beer
and
dig
into
a
stack
of
hay
and
doze
like
any
peer
when
i
would
wash
beside
a
brook
my
solitary
shirt
and
though
it
dried
upon
my
back
i
never
took
a
hurt
when
i
went
romping
down
the
road
contemptuous
of
care
and
slapped
adventure
on
the
back
by
gad
we
were
a
pair
when
though
my
pockets
lacked
a
coin
and
though
my
coat
was
old
the
largess
of
the
stars
was
mine
and
all
the
sunset
gold
when
time
was
only
made
for
fools
and
free
as
air
was
i
and
hard
i
hit
and
hard
i
lived
beneath
the
open
sky
when
all
the
roads
were
one
to
me
and
each
had
its
allure
ye
gods
these
were
the
happy
days
the
days
when
i
was
poor
ii
or
else
again
old
pal
of
mine
do
you
recall
the
times
you
struggled
with
your
storyettes
i
wrestled
with
my
rhymes
oh
we
were
happy
were
we
not
we
used
to
live
so
high
a
little
bit
of
broken
roof
between
us
and
the
sky
upon
the
forge
of
art
we
toiled
with
hammer
and
with
tongs
you
told
me
all
your
rippling
yarns
i
sang
to
you
my
songs
our
hats
were
frayed
our
jackets
patched
our
boots
were
down
at
heel
but
oh
the
happy
men
were
we
although
we
lacked
a
meal
and
if
i
sold
a
bit
of
rhyme
or
if
you
placed
a
tale
what
feasts
we
had
of
tenderloins
and
and
ale
and
yet
how
often
we
would
dine
as
cheerful
as
you
please
beside
our
little
friendly
fire
on
coffee
bread
and
cheese
we
lived
upon
the
ragged
edge
and
grub
was
never
sure
but
oh
these
were
the
happy
days
the
days
when
we
were
poor
iii
alas
old
man
we
wealthy
now
it
sad
beyond
a
doubt
we
can
not
dodge
prosperity
success
has
found
us
out
your
eye
is
very
dull
and
drear
my
brow
is
creased
with
care
we
realize
how
hard
it
is
to
be
a
millionaire
the
burden
heavy
on
our
backs
you
thinking
of
your
rents
i
worrying
if
i
invest
in
five
or
six
per
cents
we
limousines
and
marble
halls
and
flunkeys
by
the
score
we
play
the
part
but
say
old
chap
oh
is
it
a
bore
we
work
like
slaves
we
eat
too
much
we
put
on
evening
dress
we
everything
a
man
can
want
i
think
but
happiness
come
let
us
sneak
away
old
chum
forget
that
we
are
rich
and
earn
an
honest
appetite
and
scratch
an
honest
itch
let
be
two
jolly
garreteers
up
seven
flights
of
stairs
and
wear
old
clothes
and
just
pretend
we
are
millionaires
and
wonder
how
we
pay
the
rent
and
scribble
ream
on
ream
and
sup
on
sausages
and
tea
and
laugh
and
loaf
and
dream
and
when
we
tired
of
that
my
friend
oh
you
will
come
with
me
and
we
will
seek
the
sunlit
roads
that
lie
beside
the
sea
we
know
the
joy
the
gipsy
knows
the
freedom
nothing
mars
the
golden
of
dawn
the
mintage
of
the
stars
we
smoke
our
pipes
and
watch
the
pot
and
feed
the
crackling
fire
and
sing
like
two
old
jolly
boys
and
dance
to
heart
desire
we
climb
the
hill
and
ford
the
brook
and
camp
upon
the
moor
old
chap
let
haste
i
mad
to
taste
the
joy
of
being
poor
v
my
garret
montparnasse
june
my
neighbors
rest
my
fagged
brain
now
and
then
when
wearied
of
my
proper
labors
i
lay
aside
my
lagging
pen
and
get
to
thinking
on
my
neighbors
for
oh
around
my
garret
den
there
woe
and
poverty
and
life
so
interesting
when
a
lad
is
only
now
there
that
artist
gaunt
and
wan
a
little
card
his
door
adorning
it
reads
je
ne
suis
pour
personne
a
very
frank
and
fitting
warning
i
fear
he
in
a
sorry
plight
he
starves
i
think
too
proud
to
borrow
i
hear
him
moaning
every
night
maybe
they
find
him
dead
room
the
painter
chap
he
gives
me
such
a
bold
and
curious
look
that
young
american
across
the
way
as
if
he
like
to
put
me
in
a
book
fancies
himself
a
poet
so
they
say
ah
well
he
make
no
document
of
me
i
lock
my
door
ha
ha
now
none
shall
pictures
just
pictures
piled
from
roof
to
floor
each
one
a
bit
of
me
a
dream
fulfilled
a
vision
of
the
beauty
i
adore
my
own
poor
glimpse
of
glory
but
now
my
money
gone
i
paint
no
more
for
three
days
past
i
have
not
tasted
food
the
jeweled
colors
run
i
reel
i
faint
they
tell
me
that
my
pictures
are
no
good
just
crude
and
childish
daubs
a
waste
of
paint
i
burned
to
throw
on
canvas
all
i
saw
twilight
on
water
tenderness
of
trees
wet
sands
at
sunset
and
the
smoking
seas
the
peace
of
valleys
and
the
mountain
awe
emotion
swayed
me
at
the
thought
of
these
i
sought
to
paint
ere
i
had
learned
to
draw
and
that
the
ah
well
here
am
i
facing
my
failure
after
struggle
long
and
there
they
are
my
that
none
will
buy
and
doubtless
they
are
right
and
i
am
wrong
well
when
one
lost
one
faith
it
time
to
this
knife
will
do
and
now
to
slash
and
slash
rip
them
to
ribands
rend
them
every
one
my
dreams
and
visions
tear
and
stab
and
gash
so
that
their
crudeness
may
be
known
to
none
poor
miserable
daubs
ah
there
it
and
now
to
close
my
little
window
tight
lo
in
the
dusking
sky
serenely
set
the
evening
star
is
like
a
beacon
bright
and
see
to
keep
her
tender
tryst
with
night
how
paris
veils
herself
in
oh
why
does
god
create
such
men
as
i
all
pride
and
passion
and
divine
desire
raw
quivering
and
devouring
fire
foredoomed
to
failure
though
they
try
and
try
abortive
blindly
to
destruction
hurled
unfound
unfit
to
grapple
with
the
and
now
to
light
my
wheezy
jet
of
gas
chink
up
the
and
the
door
so
that
no
single
breath
of
air
may
pass
so
that
i
sealed
from
roof
to
floor
there
there
that
done
and
now
there
nothing
look
at
the
city
myriad
lamps
see
the
calm
moon
is
launching
into
space
there
will
be
darkness
in
these
eyes
of
mine
ere
it
can
climb
to
shine
upon
my
face
oh
it
will
find
such
peace
upon
my
face
city
of
beauty
i
have
loved
you
well
a
laugh
or
two
i
had
but
many
a
sigh
i
run
with
you
the
scale
from
to
hell
paris
i
love
you
still
thus
it
all
ends
unhappily
alas
it
time
to
sleep
and
now
out
the
there
that
little
who
goes
to
work
each
morning
daily
i
choose
to
call
her
blithe
babette
because
she
always
humming
gaily
and
though
the
goddess
may
look
on
her
with
prim
expression
it
pagan
paris
where
you
know
the
queen
of
virtues
is
room
the
little
workgirl
three
gentlemen
live
close
beside
me
a
painter
of
pictures
bizarre
a
poet
whose
virtues
might
guide
me
a
singer
who
plays
the
guitar
and
there
on
my
lintel
is
cupid
i
leave
my
door
open
and
yet
these
gentlemen
are
they
stupid
they
never
make
love
to
babette
i
go
to
the
shop
every
morning
i
work
with
my
needle
and
thread
silk
satin
and
velvet
adorning
then
luncheon
on
coffee
and
bread
then
sewing
and
sewing
till
seven
or
else
if
the
order
i
get
i
toil
and
i
toil
till
eleven
and
such
is
the
day
of
babette
it
does
seem
cheerful
i
fancy
the
wage
is
unthinkably
small
and
yet
there
is
one
thing
i
can
say
i
keep
a
bright
face
through
it
all
i
chaff
though
my
head
may
be
aching
i
sing
a
gay
song
to
forget
i
laugh
though
my
heart
may
be
breaking
it
all
in
the
life
of
babette
that
gown
o
my
lady
of
leisure
you
begged
to
be
finished
in
haste
it
gives
you
an
exquisite
pleasure
your
lovers
remark
on
its
taste
yet
oh
the
poor
little
white
faces
the
tense
midnight
toil
and
the
fret
i
fear
that
the
foam
of
its
laces
is
salt
with
the
tears
of
babette
it
takes
a
brave
heart
to
be
cheery
with
no
gleam
of
hope
in
the
sky
the
future
so
utterly
dreary
i
laughing
in
case
i
should
cry
and
if
where
the
gay
lights
are
glowing
i
dine
with
a
man
i
have
met
and
snatch
a
bright
moment
who
going
to
blame
a
poor
little
babette
and
you
friend
beyond
all
the
telling
although
you
an
ocean
away
your
pictures
they
tell
me
are
selling
you
married
and
settled
they
say
such
happiness
one
would
barter
yet
oh
do
you
never
regret
the
springtide
the
roses
montmartre
youth
poverty
love
and
babette
chap
across
the
way
with
sunny
smile
and
voice
so
mellow
he
sings
in
some
cheap
cabaret
yet
what
a
gay
and
charming
fellow
his
breath
with
garlic
may
be
strong
what
matters
it
his
laugh
is
jolly
his
day
he
gives
to
sleep
and
song
his
night
made
up
of
song
and
room
the
concert
singer
i
one
of
these
haphazard
chaps
who
sit
in
cafes
drinking
a
most
improper
taste
perhaps
yet
pleasant
to
my
thinking
for
oh
i
hate
discord
and
strife
i
sadly
weakly
human
and
i
do
think
the
best
of
life
is
wine
and
song
and
woman
now
there
that
youngster
on
my
right
who
thinks
himself
a
poet
and
so
he
toils
from
morn
to
night
and
vainly
hopes
to
show
it
and
there
that
dauber
on
my
left
within
his
chamber
shrinking
he
looks
like
one
of
hope
bereft
he
lives
on
air
i
thinking
but
me
i
love
the
things
that
are
my
heart
is
always
merry
i
laugh
and
tune
my
old
guitar
ho
and
oh
let
them
toil
their
lives
away
to
gild
a
tawdry
era
but
i
be
gay
while
yet
i
may
i
sure
you
know
that
picture
well
a
monk
all
else
unheeding
within
a
bare
and
gloomy
cell
a
musty
volume
reading
while
through
the
window
you
can
see
in
sunny
glade
entrancing
with
cap
and
bells
beneath
a
tree
a
jester
dancing
dancing
which
is
the
fool
and
which
the
sage
i
can
not
quite
discover
but
you
may
look
in
learning
page
and
i
be
laughter
lover
for
this
our
life
is
none
too
long
and
hearts
were
made
for
gladness
let
virtue
lie
in
joy
and
song
the
only
sin
be
sadness
so
let
me
troll
a
jolly
air
come
what
come
will
i
be
no
of
care
no
of
sorrow
let
those
who
will
indulge
in
strife
to
my
most
merry
thinking
the
true
philosophy
of
life
is
laughing
loving
drinking
there
that
weird
and
ghastly
hag
who
walks
head
bent
with
lips
with
twitching
hands
and
feet
that
drag
and
tattered
skirts
that
sweep
the
gutter
an
outworn
harlot
lost
to
hope
with
staring
eyes
and
hair
that
hoary
i
hear
her
gibber
dazed
with
dope
i
often
wonder
what
her
room
the
i
look
at
no
one
me
i
pass
them
on
the
stair
shadows
i
do
see
shadows
everywhere
haunting
taunting
staring
glaring
shadows
i
do
care
once
my
room
i
gain
then
my
life
begins
shut
the
door
on
pain
how
the
devil
grins
grin
with
might
and
main
grin
and
grin
in
vain
here
where
begins

my
fling

of
a
king
in
my
day

blessed

how
the
wretched
room
rushes
from
my
sight
misery
and
gloom
melt
into
delight
fear
and
death
and
doom
vanish
in
the
night
no
more
cold
and
pain

am
young
again
beautiful

oh
i
was
made
to

and
a
life
that
sweet
fireside
blessings
and
motherhood
little
ones
playing
around
my
feet
how
it
all
unfolds
like
a
magic
screen

and
glowing
and
clear
and
glad
the
wonderful
mother
i
might
have
been
the
beautiful
children
i
might
have
had
romping
and
laughing
and
shrill
with
glee
oh
i
see
them
now
and
i
see
them
plain
darlings
come
nestle
up
close
to
me

ca
do
what
we

robes
us
with
her
shame
she
crowns
us
with
her
ill
i
do
not
care
because
i
see
with
bitter
calm
life
made
me
what
i
was
life
makes
me
what
i
am
could
i
throw
back
the
years

all
would
be
the
same
hunger
and
cold
and
tears
misery
fear
and
shame
and
then
the
old
refrain
cocaine
cocaine
a
i
so
here
my
mother
came
where
she
might
live
in
peace
with
none
to
blame
and
how
she
toiled
harder
than
any
slave
what
courage
patient
hopeful
tender
brave
we
had
a
little
room
at
lavilette
so
small
so
neat
so
clean
i
see
it
yet
poor
mother
sewing
sewing
late
at
night
her
wasted
face
beside
the
candlelight
this
paris
crushed
her
how
she
used
to
sigh
and
as
i
watched
her
from
my
bed
i
knew
she
saw
red
roofs
against
a
primrose
sky
and
glistening
fields
and
apples
dimmed
with
dew
hard
times
we
had
we
counted
every
we
sewed
sacks
for
a
living
i
was
quick
four
busy
hands
to
work
instead
of
two
oh
we
were
happy
there
till
she
fell
my
mother
lay
her
face
turned
to
the
wall
and
i
a
girl
of
sixteen
fair
and
tall
sat
by
her
side
all
stricken
with
despair
knelt
by
her
bed
and
faltered
out
a
prayer
a
doctor
order
on
the
table
lay
medicine
for
which
alas
i
could
not
pay
medicine
to
save
her
life
to
soothe
her
pain
i
sought
for
something
i
could
sell
in
vain
all
all
was
gone
the
room
was
cold
and
bare
gone
blankets
and
the
cloak
i
used
to
wear
bare
floor
and
wall
and
cupboard
every
shelf
nothing
that
i
could
sell
except
myself
i
sought
the
street
i
could
not
bear
to
hear
my
mother
moaning
there
i
clutched
the
paper
in
my
hand
was
hard
you
can
not
understand
i
walked
as
martyr
to
the
flame
almost
exalted
in
my
shame
they
turned
who
heard
my
voiceless
cry
for
sale
a
virgin
who
will
buy
and
so
myself
i
fiercely
sold
and
clutched
the
price
a
piece
of
gold
into
a
pharmacy
i
pressed
i
took
the
paper
from
my
breast
i
gave
my
money
how
it
gleamed
how
precious
to
my
eyes
it
seemed
and
then
i
saw
the
chemist
frown
quick
on
the
counter
throw
it
down
shake
with
an
angry
look
his
head
your
is
bad
he
said
dazed
crushed
i
went
into
the
night
i
clutched
my
gleaming
coin
so
tight
no
no
i
could
not
well
believe
that
any
one
could
so
deceive
i
tried
again
and
yet
again
contempt
suspicion
and
disdain
always
the
same
reply
i
had
get
out
of
this
your
money
bad
heart
broken
to
the
room
i
crept
to
mother
side
all
still
she
slept
i
bent
i
sought
to
raise
her
head
oh
god
have
pity
she
was
dead
that
how
it
all
began
said
i
revenge
is
sweet
so
in
my
guilty
span
i
ruined
many
a
man
they
groveled
at
my
feet
i
pity
had
for
none
i
bled
them
every
one
oh
i
had
interest
for
that
worthless
but
now
it
over
see
i
care
for
no
one
me
only
at
night
sometimes
in
dreams
i
hear
the
chimes
of
and
see
a
woman
without
stain
with
children
at
her
knee
ah
how
you
comfort
me
cocaine
book
three
late
summer
i
the
omnium
bar
near
the
bourse
late
july
macbean
before
he
settled
down
to
the
manufacture
of
mercantile
fiction
had
ideas
of
a
nobler
sort
which
bore
their
fruit
in
a
slender
book
of
poems
in
subject
they
are
either
erotic
mythologic
or
descriptive
of
nature
so
polished
are
they
that
the
mind
seems
to
slide
over
them
so
faultless
in
form
that
the
critics
hailed
them
with
highest
praise
and
as
many
as
a
hundred
copies
were
sold
saxon
dane
too
has
published
a
book
of
poems
but
he
on
the
other
hand
defies
tradition
to
an
eccentric
degree
originality
is
his
sin
he
strains
after
it
in
every
line
i
must
confess
i
think
much
of
the
free
verse
he
writes
is
really
prose
and
a
good
deal
of
it
blank
verse
chopped
up
into
odd
lengths
he
talks
of
assonance
and
color
of
stress
and
pause
and
accent
and
bewilders
me
with
his
theories
he
and
macbean
represent
two
extremes
and
at
night
as
we
sit
in
the
cafe
du
dôme
they
have
the
hottest
of
arguments
as
for
me
i
listen
with
awe
content
that
my
medium
is
verse
and
that
the
fashions
of
hood
thackeray
and
bret
harte
are
the
fashions
of
of
late
i
have
been
doing
light
stuff
fillers
for
macbean
here
are
three
of
my
specimens
the
philanderer
oh
have
you
forgotten
those
afternoons
with
riot
of
roses
and
amber
skies
when
we
thrilled
to
the
joy
of
a
million
junes
and
i
sought
for
your
soul
in
the
deeps
of
your
eyes
i
would
love
you
i
promised
forever
and
aye
and
i
meant
it
too
yet
oh
is
it
odd
when
we
met
in
the
underground
i
addressed
you
as
mary
instead
of
as
maude
oh
do
you
remember
that
moonlit
sea
with
us
on
a
silver
trail
afloat
when
i
gracefully
sank
on
my
bended
knee
at
the
risk
of
upsetting
our
little
boat
oh
i
vowed
that
my
life
was
blighted
then
as
friendship
you
proffered
with
mournful
mien
but
now
as
i
think
of
your
children
ten
i
glad
you
refused
me
evangeline
oh
is
that
moment
eternal
still
when
i
breathed
my
love
in
your
ear
and
you
plucked
at
your
fan
as
a
maiden
will
and
you
blushed
so
charmingly
guenivere
like
a
worshiper
at
your
feet
i
sat
for
a
year
and
a
day
you
made
me
mad
but
now
alas
you
are
forty
fat
and
i
think
what
a
lucky
escape
i
had
oh
maidens
i
set
in
a
sacred
shrine
oh
rosamond
molly
and
mignonette
i
deemed
you
in
turn
the
most
divine
in
turn
you
broken
my
heart
and
yet
it
easily
mended
what
past
is
past
on
lucy
i
going
to
call
for
i
sure
that
i
know
true
love
at
last
and
is
the
fairest
girl
of
all
the
sow
your
wild
oats
in
your
youth
so
we
always
told
but
i
say
with
deeper
sooth
sow
them
when
you
old
i
be
wise
till
i
about
seventy
or
so
then
by
gad
i
blossom
out
as
an
ancient
i
assume
a
dashing
air
laugh
with
loud
ha
ha
how
my
grandchildren
will
stare
at
their
grandpapa
their
perfection
aureoled
i
will
scandalize
wo
i
be
a
hoary
old
sinner
in
their
eyes
watch
me
how
i
learn
to
chaff
barmaids
in
a
bar
scotches
daily
gayly
quaff
puff
a
fierce
cigar
i
will
haunt
the
tango
teas
at
the
stand
wait
for
dolly
dimpleknees
bouquet
in
my
hand
then
at
seventy
i
take
flutters
at
roulette
while
at
eighty
hope
i
make
good
at
poker
yet
and
in
fashionable
togs
to
the
races
go
gayest
of
the
gay
old
dogs
ninety
years
or
so
sow
your
wild
oats
while
you
young
that
what
you
are
told
do
believe
the
foolish
tongue
sow
when
you
old
till
you
threescore
years
and
ten
take
my
humble
tip
sow
your
nice
tame
oats
and
then
hi
boys
let
rip
my
masterpiece
it
slim
and
trim
and
bound
in
blue
its
leaves
are
crisp
and
edged
with
gold
its
words
are
simple
stalwart
too
its
thoughts
are
tender
wise
and
bold
its
pages
scintillate
with
wit
its
pathos
clutches
at
my
throat
oh
how
i
love
each
line
of
it
that
little
book
i
never
wrote
in
dreams
i
see
it
praised
and
prized
by
all
from
plowman
unto
peer
it
and
memorized
it
loaned
and
not
returned
i
fear
it
worn
and
torn
and
and
even
dusky
natives
quote
that
classic
that
the
world
has
lost
the
little
book
i
never
wrote
poor
ghost
for
homes
you
failed
to
cheer
for
grieving
hearts
uncomforted
do
haunt
me
alas
i
fear
the
fire
of
inspiration
dead
a
humdrum
way
i
go
from
all
i
hoped
and
dreamed
remote
too
late
a
better
man
must
write
that
little
book
i
never
wrote
talking
about
writing
books
there
is
a
queer
character
who
shuffles
up
and
down
the
little
streets
that
neighbor
the
place
maubert
and
who
they
say
has
been
engaged
on
one
for
years
sometimes
i
see
him
cowering
in
some
cheap
and
his
wild
eyes
gleam
at
me
through
the
tangle
of
his
hair
but
i
do
not
think
he
ever
sees
me
he
mumbles
to
himself
and
moves
like
a
man
in
a
dream
his
pockets
are
full
of
filthy
paper
on
which
he
writes
from
time
to
time
the
students
laugh
at
him
and
make
him
tipsy
the
street
boys
pelt
him
with
ordure
the
better
cafes
turn
him
from
their
doors
but
who
knows
at
least
this
is
how
i
see
him
my
book
before
i
drink
myself
to
death
god
let
me
finish
up
my
book
at
night
i
fear
i
fight
for
breath
and
wake
up
whiter
than
a
spook
and
crawl
off
to
a
near
and
drink
until
my
brain
is
clear
rare
absinthe
oh
it
gives
me
strength
to
write
and
write
and
so
i
spend
day
after
day
until
at
length
with
joy
and
pain
i
write
the
end
then
let
this
carcase
rot
i
give
the
world
my
book
my
book
will
live
for
every
line
is
tense
with
truth
there
hope
and
joy
on
every
page
a
cheer
a
clarion
call
to
youth
a
hymn
a
comforter
to
age
all
there
that
i
was
meant
to
be
my
part
divine
the
god
in
me
it
of
my
life
the
golden
sum
ah
who
that
reads
this
book
of
mine
in
stormy
centuries
to
come
will
dream
i
rooted
with
the
swine
behold
i
give
mankind
my
best
what
does
it
matter
all
the
rest
it
this
that
makes
sublime
my
day
it
this
that
makes
me
struggle
on
oh
let
them
mock
my
mortal
clay
my
spirit
deathless
as
the
dawn
oh
let
them
shudder
as
they
look
i
be
immortal
in
my
book
and
so
beside
the
sullen
seine
i
fight
with
dogs
for
filthy
food
yet
know
that
from
my
sin
and
pain
will
soar
serene
a
something
good
exultantly
from
shame
and
wrong
a
right
a
glory
and
a
song
how
charming
it
is
this
paris
of
the
summer
skies
each
morning
i
leap
up
with
joy
in
my
heart
all
eager
to
begin
the
day
of
work
as
i
eat
my
breakfast
and
smoke
my
pipe
i
ponder
over
my
task
then
in
the
golden
sunshine
that
floods
my
little
attic
i
pace
up
and
down
absorbed
and
forgetful
of
the
world
as
i
compose
i
speak
the
words
aloud
there
are
difficulties
to
overcome
thoughts
that
will
not
fit
their
mold
rebellious
rhymes
ah
those
moments
of
despair
and
defeat
then
suddenly
the
mind
grows
lucid
imagination
glows
the
snarl
unravels
in
the
end
is
always
triumph
and
success
o
delectable
who
would
not
be
a
rhymesmith
in
paris
in
bohemia
in
the
heart
of
youth
i
have
now
finished
my
twentieth
ballad
five
more
and
they
will
be
done
in
quiet
corners
of
cafes
on
benches
of
the
luxembourg
on
the
sunny
quays
i
read
them
over
one
by
one
here
is
my
latest
my
hour
day
after
day
behold
me
plying
my
pen
within
an
office
drear
the
dullest
dog
till
homeward
hieing
then
lo
i
reign
a
king
of
cheer
a
throne
have
i
of
padded
leather
a
little
court
of
kiddies
three
a
wife
who
smiles
the
weather
a
feast
of
muffins
jam
and
tea
the
table
cleared
a
romping
battle
a
fairy
tale
a
children
bed
a
kiss
a
hug
a
hush
of
prattle
god
save
each
little
drowsy
head
a
cozy
chat
with
wife
a
silver
lining
clouds
that
then
she
too
goes
and
with
her
going
i
come
again
into
my
hour
i
poke
the
fire
i
snugly
settle
my
pipe
i
prime
with
proper
care
the
water
purring
in
the
kettle
rum
lemon
sugar
all
are
there
and
now
the
honest
grog
is
steaming
and
now
the
trusty
briar
aglow
alas
in
smoking
drinking
dreaming
how
sadly
swift
the
moments
go
oh
golden
hour
love
and
duty
all
others
i
to
others
give
but
you
are
mine
to
yield
to
beauty
to
glean
romance
to
greatly
live
for
in
my
reclining
feel
the
sting
of
ocean
spray
and
yonder
wondrously
are
shining
the
magic
isles
of
far
away
beyond
the
comber
crashing
thunder
strange
beaches
flash
into
my
ken
on
jetties
heaped
with
plunder
i
dance
and
dice
with
strange
stars
swarm
down
to
burn
above
me
strange
shadows
haunt
strange
voices
greet
strange
women
lure
and
laugh
and
love
me
and
fling
their
bastards
at
my
feet
oh
i
would
wish
the
wide
world
over
in
ports
of
passion
and
unrest
to
drink
and
drain
a
tarry
rover
with
dragons
tattooed
on
my
chest
with
haunted
eyes
that
hold
red
glories
of
foaming
seas
and
crashing
shores
with
lips
that
tell
the
strangest
stories
of
sunken
ships
and
gold
moidores
till
sick
of
storm
and
strife
and
slaughter
some
ghostly
night
when
hides
the
moon
i
slip
into
the
water
and
softly
swim
the
stale
lagoon
then
through
some
jungle
or
plumed
morass
or
woodland
wild
i
win
my
way
with
heart
undaunted
and
all
the
wonder
of
a
child
the
pathless
plains
shall
swoon
around
me
the
forests
frown
the
floods
appall
the
mountains
tiptoe
to
confound
me
the
rivers
roar
to
speed
my
fall
wild
dooms
shall
daunt
and
dawns
be
gory
and
death
shall
sit
beside
my
knee
till
after
terror
torment
glory
i
win
again
the
sea
the
sea
oh
anguish
sweet
oh
triumph
splendid
oh
dreams
adieu
my
pipe
is
dead
my
glass
is
dry
my
hour
is
ended
it
time
indeed
i
stole
to
bed
how
peacefully
the
house
is
sleeping
ah
why
should
i
strange
fortunes
plan
to
guard
the
dear
ones
in
my
keeping
that
task
enough
for
any
man
so
through
dim
seas
i
go
spoiling
the
red
tortugas
never
roam
please
god
i
keep
the
pot
and
make
at
least
a
happy
home
my
children
path
shall
gleam
with
roses
their
grace
abound
their
joy
increase
and
so
my
hour
divinely
closes
with
tender
thoughts
of
praise
and
peace
ii
the
garden
of
the
luxembourg
late
july
when
on
some
scintillating
summer
morning
i
leap
lightly
up
to
the
seclusion
of
my
garret
i
often
think
of
those
lines
in
the
brave
days
when
i
was
true
i
have
no
loving
kind
lisette
to
pin
her
petticoat
across
the
pane
yet
i
do
live
in
hope
am
i
not
in
bohemia
the
magical
bohemia
of
murger
of
de
musset
of
verlaine
shades
of
mimi
pinson
of
trilby
of
all
that
immortal
line
of
laughterful
grisettes
do
not
tell
me
that
the
days
of
love
and
fun
are
forever
at
an
end
yes
youth
is
golden
but
what
of
age
shall
it
too
not
testify
to
the
rhapsody
of
existence
let
the
years
between
be
those
of
struggle
of
sufferance
of
disillusion
if
you
will
but
let
youth
and
age
affirm
the
ecstasy
of
being
let
us
look
forward
all
to
a
serene
sunset
and
in
the
still
skies
a
late
lark
singing
this
thought
comes
to
me
as
sitting
on
a
bench
near
the
i
see
an
old
savant
who
talks
to
all
the
children
his
face
is
alive
with
kindliness
under
his
tall
silk
hat
his
white
hair
falls
to
his
shoulders
he
wears
a
long
black
cape
over
a
black
very
neat
linen
and
a
flowing
tie
of
black
silk
i
call
him
silvester
bonnard
as
i
look
at
him
i
truly
think
the
best
of
life
are
the
years
between
sixty
and
seventy
a
song
of
brave
thackeray
has
trolled
of
days
when
he
was
and
bounded
up
five
flights
of
stairs
a
gallant
garreteer
and
yet
again
in
mellow
vein
when
youth
was
gaily
run
has
dipped
his
nose
in
gascon
wine
and
told
of
forty
year
but
if
i
worthy
were
to
sing
a
richer
rarer
time
i
tune
my
pipes
before
the
fire
and
merrily
i
strive
to
praise
that
age
when
prose
again
has
given
way
to
rhyme
the
indian
summer
days
of
life
when
i
be
for
then
my
work
will
all
be
done
my
voyaging
be
past
and
i
have
earned
the
right
to
rest
where
folding
hills
are
green
so
in
some
glassy
anchorage
i
make
my
cable
fast
oh
let
the
seas
show
all
their
teeth
i
sit
and
smile
serene
the
storm
may
bellow
round
the
roof
i
bide
beside
the
fire
and
many
a
scene
of
sail
and
trail
within
the
flame
i
see
for
i
have
worn
away
the
spur
of
passion
and
oh
yes
when
i
am
what
peace
will
come
to
me
i
take
my
breakfast
in
my
bed
i
rise
at
ten
when
all
the
world
is
nicely
groomed
and
full
of
golden
song
i
smoke
a
bit
and
joke
a
bit
and
read
the
news
and
then
i
potter
round
my
till
i
hear
the
luncheon
gong
and
after
that
i
think
i
doze
an
hour
well
maybe
two
and
then
i
show
some
kindred
soul
how
well
my
roses
thrive
i
do
the
things
i
never
yet
have
found
the
time
to
oh
wo
i
be
the
busy
man
when
i
am
i
revel
in
my
library
i
read
de
morgan
books
i
grow
so
garrulous
i
fear
you
write
me
down
a
bore
i
watch
the
ways
of
ants
and
bees
in
quiet
sunny
nooks
i
understand
creation
as
i
never
did
before
when
gossips
round
the
talk
i
listen
to
it
all
on
smiling
days
some
kindly
friend
will
take
me
for
a
drive
i
own
a
shaggy
collie
dog
that
dashes
to
my
call
i
celebrate
my
second
youth
when
i
am
ah
though
i
twenty
years
to
go
i
see
myself
quite
plain
a
wrinkling
twinkling
benevolent
old
chap
i
think
i
wear
a
tartan
shawl
and
lean
upon
a
cane
i
hope
that
i
have
silver
hair
beneath
a
velvet
cap
i
see
my
little
grandchildren
round
my
knee
so
gay
the
scene
i
almost
wish
hasten
to
arrive
let
others
sing
of
youth
and
spring
still
will
it
seem
to
me
the
golden
time
the
olden
time
some
time
round
from
old
men
to
children
is
but
a
step
and
there
too
in
the
shadow
of
the
fontaine
de
medicis
i
spend
much
of
my
time
watching
the
little
ones
childhood
so
innocent
so
helpless
so
trusting
is
somehow
pathetic
to
me
there
was
one
jolly
little
chap
who
used
to
play
with
a
large
white
teddy
bear
he
was
always
with
his
mother
a
woman
who
followed
his
every
movement
with
delight
i
used
to
watch
them
both
and
often
spoke
a
few
words
then
one
day
i
missed
them
and
it
struck
me
i
had
not
seen
them
for
a
week
even
a
month
maybe
after
that
i
looked
for
them
a
time
or
two
and
soon
forgot
then
this
morning
i
saw
the
mother
in
the
rue
she
was
alone
and
in
deep
black
i
wanted
to
ask
after
the
boy
but
there
was
a
look
in
her
face
that
stopped
me
i
do
not
think
she
will
ever
enter
the
garden
of
the
luxembourg
again
teddy
bear
o
teddy
bear
with
your
head
awry
and
your
comical
twisted
smile
you
rub
your
eyes
do
you
wonder
why
you
slept
such
a
long
long
while
as
you
lay
so
still
in
the
cupboard
dim
and
you
heard
on
the
roof
the
rain
were
you
thinking
what
has
become
of
and
when
will
he
play
again
do
you
sometimes
long
for
a
chubby
hand
and
a
voice
so
sweetly
shrill
o
teddy
bear
do
you
understand
why
the
house
is
still
you
sit
with
your
muzzle
propped
on
your
paws
and
your
whimsical
face
askew
do
wait
do
wait
for
your
friend
because
he
sleeping
and
dreaming
too
aye
sleeping
you
remember
how
he
stabbed
our
hearts
with
his
cries
and
oh
the
dew
of
pain
on
his
brow
and
the
deeps
of
pain
in
his
eyes
and
teddy
bear
you
remember
too
as
he
sighed
and
sank
to
his
rest
how
all
of
a
sudden
he
smiled
to
you
and
he
clutched
you
close
to
his
breast
i
put
you
away
little
teddy
bear
in
the
cupboard
far
from
my
sight
maybe
he
come
and
he
kiss
you
there
a
wee
white
ghost
in
the
night
but
me
i
live
with
my
love
and
pain
a
weariful
lifetime
through
and
my
hope
will
i
see
him
again
again
ah
god
if
i
only
knew
after
old
men
and
children
i
am
greatly
interested
in
dogs
i
will
go
out
of
my
way
to
caress
one
who
shows
any
desire
to
be
friendly
there
is
a
very
filthy
fellow
who
collects
cigarette
stubs
on
the
boul
mich
and
who
is
always
followed
by
a
starved
yellow
cur
the
other
day
i
came
across
them
in
a
little
side
street
the
man
was
stretched
on
the
pavement
brutishly
drunk
and
dead
to
the
world
the
dog
lying
by
his
side
seemed
to
look
at
me
with
sad
imploring
eyes
though
all
the
world
despise
that
man
i
thought
this
poor
brute
loves
him
and
will
be
faithful
unto
death
from
this
incident
i
wrote
the
verses
that
follow
the
outlaw
a
wild
and
woeful
race
he
ran
of
lust
and
sin
by
land
and
sea
until
abhorred
of
god
and
man
they
swung
him
from
the
and
then
he
climbed
the
starry
stair
and
dumb
and
naked
and
alone
with
head
unbowed
and
brazen
glare
he
stood
before
the
judgment
throne
the
keeper
of
the
records
spoke
this
man
o
lord
has
mocked
thy
name
the
weak
have
wept
beneath
his
yoke
the
strong
have
fled
before
his
flame
the
blood
of
babes
is
on
his
sword
his
life
is
evil
to
the
brim
look
down
decree
his
doom
o
lord
lo
there
is
none
will
speak
for
him
the
golden
trumpets
blew
a
blast
that
echoed
in
the
crypts
of
hell
for
there
was
judgment
to
be
passed
and
lips
were
hushed
and
silence
fell
the
man
was
mute
he
made
no
stir
erect
before
the
judgment
seat
when
all
at
once
a
mongrel
cur
crept
out
and
cowered
and
licked
his
feet
it
licked
his
feet
with
whining
cry
come
come
hell
what
did
it
care
it
leapt
it
tried
to
catch
his
eye
its
master
yea
its
god
was
there
then
as
a
thrill
of
wonder
sped
through
throngs
of
shining
seraphim
the
judge
of
all
looked
down
and
said
lo
here
is
one
who
pleads
for
him
and
who
shall
love
of
these
the
least
and
who
by
word
or
look
or
deed
shall
pity
show
to
bird
or
beast
by
me
shall
have
a
friend
in
need
aye
though
his
sin
be
black
as
night
and
though
he
stand
men
alone
he
shall
be
softened
in
my
sight
and
find
a
pleader
by
my
throne
so
let
this
man
to
glory
win
from
life
to
life
salvation
glean
by
pain
and
sacrifice
and
sin
until
he
stand
before
me
for
he
who
loves
the
least
of
these
and
here
i
say
and
here
repeat
shall
win
himself
an
angel
pleas
for
mercy
at
my
judgment
seat
i
take
my
exercise
in
the
form
of
walking
it
keeps
me
fit
and
leaves
me
free
to
think
in
this
way
i
have
come
to
know
paris
like
my
pocket
i
have
explored
its
large
and
little
streets
its
stateliness
and
its
slums
but
most
of
all
i
love
the
quays
between
the
leafage
and
the
sunlit
seine
like
shuttles
the
little
steamers
dart
up
and
down
weaving
the
water
into
patterns
of
foam
barges
stream
under
the
lacework
of
the
many
bridges
and
make
me
think
of
tranquil
days
and
horizons
but
what
i
love
most
is
the
stealing
in
of
night
when
the
sky
takes
on
that
strange
elusive
purple
when
eyes
turn
to
the
evening
star
and
marvel
at
its
brightness
when
the
eiffel
tower
becomes
a
strange
shadowy
stairway
yearning
in
impotent
effort
to
the
careless
moon
here
is
my
latest
ballad
short
if
not
very
sweet
the
walkers
walking
walking
oh
the
joy
of
walking
swinging
down
the
tawny
lanes
with
head
held
high
striding
up
the
green
hills
through
the
heather
stalking
swishing
through
the
woodlands
where
the
brown
leaves
lie
marveling
at
all
things
windmills
gaily
turning
apples
for
the
and
gold
tails
of
rabbits

the
cafe
de
la
source
late
in
july
the
other
evening
macbean
was
in
a
pessimistic
mood
why
do
you
write
he
asked
me
gloomily
obviously
i
said
to
avoid
starving
to
produce
something
that
will
buy
me
food
shelter
raiment
if
you
were
a
millionaire
would
you
still
write
yes
i
said
after
a
moment
thought
you
get
an
idea
it
haunts
you
it
seems
to
clamor
for
expression
it
begins
to
obsess
you
at
last
in
desperation
you
embody
it
in
a
poem
an
essay
a
story
there
it
is
disposed
of
you
are
at
rest
it
troubles
you
no
more
yes
if
i
were
a
millionaire
i
should
write
if
it
were
only
to
escape
from
my
ideas
you
have
given
two
reasons
why
men
write
said
macbean
for
gain
for
then
again
some
men
write
to
amuse
themselves
some
because
they
conceive
they
have
a
mission
in
the
world
some
because
they
have
real
genius
and
are
conscious
they
can
enrich
the
literature
of
all
time
i
must
say
i
do
know
of
any
belonging
to
the
latter
class
we
are
living
in
an
age
of
mediocrity
there
is
no
writer
of
who
will
be
read
twenty
years
after
he
is
dead
that
a
truth
that
must
come
home
to
the
best
of
them
i
guess
they
not
losing
much
sleep
over
it
i
said
take
novelists
continued
macbean
the
line
of
novelists
ended
with
dickens
and
thackeray
then
followed
some
of
the
second
class
stevenson
meredith
hardy
and
we
have
three
novelists
of
the
third
class
good
capable
craftsmen
we
can
trust
ourselves
comfortably
in
their
hands
we
read
and
enjoy
them
but
do
you
think
our
children
will
yours
wo
anyway
i
said
do
be
too
sure
i
may
surprise
you
yet
i
may
get
married
and
turn
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
to
macbean
would
be
that
it
might
change
his
point
of
view
he
is
so
painfully
discouraging
i
have
never
mentioned
my
ballads
to
him
he
would
be
sure
to
throw
cold
water
on
them
and
as
it
draws
near
to
its
end
the
thought
of
my
book
grows
more
and
more
dear
to
me
how
i
will
get
it
published
i
know
not
but
i
will
then
even
if
it
does
sell
even
if
nobody
reads
it
i
will
be
content
out
of
this
brief
perishable
me
i
will
have
made
something
concrete
something
that
will
preserve
my
thought
within
its
dusty
covers
long
after
i
am
dead
and
dust
here
is
one
of
my
latest
poor
peter
blind
peter
piper
used
to
play
all
up
and
down
the
city
i
often
meet
him
on
my
way
and
throw
a
coin
for
pity
but
all
amid
his
sparkling
tones
his
ear
was
quick
as
any
to
catch
upon
the
the
jingle
of
my
penny
and
as
upon
a
day
that
shone
he
piped
a
merry
measure
how
well
you
play
i
chanced
to
say
poor
peter
glowed
with
pleasure
you
think
the
words
of
praise
i
spoke
were
all
the
pay
he
needed
the
artist
in
the
player
woke
the
penny
lay
unheeded
now
winter
here
the
wind
is
shrill
his
coat
is
thin
and
tattered
yet
hark
he
playing
trill
on
trill
as
if
his
music
mattered
and
somehow
though
the
city
looks
soaked
through
and
through
with
shadows
he
makes
you
think
of
singing
brooks
and
larks
and
sunny
meadows
poor
chap
he
often
starves
they
say
well
well
i
can
believe
it
for
when
you
chuck
a
coin
his
way
he
let
some
thieve
it
i
fear
he
freezes
in
the
night
my
praise
i
long
repented
yet
look
his
face
is
all
alight
blind
peter
seems
contented
day
on
the
terrace
of
the
closerie
de
lilas
i
came
on
saxon
dane
he
was
smoking
his
big
briar
and
drinking
a
huge
glass
of
brown
beer
the
tree
gave
a
pleasant
shade
and
he
had
thrown
his
sombrero
on
a
chair
i
noted
how
his
high
brow
was
bronzed
by
the
sun
and
there
were
golden
lights
in
his
broad
beard
there
was
something
massive
and
imposing
in
the
man
as
he
sat
there
in
brooding
thought
macbean
he
told
me
was
sick
and
unable
to
leave
his
room
rheumatism
so
i
bought
a
cooked
chicken
and
a
bottle
of
barsac
and
mounting
to
the
apartment
of
the
invalid
i
made
him
eat
and
drink
macbean
was
very
despondent
but
cheered
up
greatly
i
think
he
rather
dreads
the
future
he
can
not
save
money
and
all
he
makes
he
spends
he
has
always
been
a
rover
often
tried
to
settle
down
but
could
not
now
i
think
he
wishes
for
security
i
fear
however
it
is
too
late
the
wistful
one
i
sought
the
trails
of
south
and
north
i
wandered
east
and
west
but
pride
and
passion
drove
me
forth
and
would
not
let
me
rest
and
still
i
seek
as
still
i
roam
a
snug
roof
overhead
four
walls
my
own
a
quiet
you
have
it
you
macbean
is
one
of
bohemia
victims
it
is
a
country
of
the
young
the
old
have
no
place
in
it
he
will
gradually
lose
his
grip
go
down
and
down
i
am
sorry
he
is
my
nearest
approach
to
a
friend
i
do
not
make
them
easily
i
have
deep
reserves
i
like
solitude
i
am
never
so
surrounded
by
boon
companions
as
when
i
am
all
alone
but
though
i
am
a
solitary
i
realize
the
beauty
of
friendship
and
on
looking
through
my
i
find
the
following
if
you
had
a
friend
if
you
had
a
friend
strong
simple
true
who
knew
your
faults
and
who
understood
who
believed
in
the
very
best
of
you
and
who
cared
for
you
as
a
father
would
who
would
stick
by
you
to
the
very
end
who
would
smile
however
the
world
might
frown
i
sure
you
would
try
to
please
your
friend
you
never
would
think
to
throw
him
down
and
supposing
your
friend
was
high
and
great
and
he
lived
in
a
palace
rich
and
tall
and
sat
like
a
king
in
shining
state
and
his
praise
was
loud
on
the
lips
of
all
well
then
when
he
turned
to
you
alone
and
he
singled
you
out
from
all
the
crowd
and
he
called
you
up
to
his
golden
throne
oh
would
you
just
be
jolly
proud
if
you
had
a
friend
like
this
i
say
so
sweet
and
tender
so
strong
and
true
you
try
to
please
him
in
every
way
you
live
at
your
bravest
now
would
you
his
worth
would
shine
in
the
words
you
penned
you
shout
his
praises
yet
now
it
odd
you
tell
me
you
have
got
such
a
friend
you
have
i
wonder
of
god
to
how
few
is
granted
the
privilege
of
doing
the
work
which
lies
closest
to
the
heart
the
work
for
which
one
is
best
fitted
the
happy
man
is
he
who
knows
his
limitations
yet
bows
to
no
false
gods
macbean
is
not
happy
he
is
overridden
by
his
appetites
and
to
satisfy
them
he
writes
stuff
that
in
his
heart
he
despises
saxon
dane
is
not
happy
his
dream
exceeds
his
grasp
his
twisted
tortured
phrases
mock
the
vague
grandiosity
of
his
visions
i
am
happy
my
talent
is
proportioned
to
my
ambition
the
things
i
like
to
write
are
the
things
i
like
to
read
i
prefer
the
lesser
poets
to
the
greater
the
cackle
of
the
barnyard
fowl
to
the
scream
of
the
eagle
i
lack
the
divinity
of
discontent
true
contentment
comes
from
within
it
dominates
circumstance
it
is
resignation
wedded
to
philosophy
a
christian
quality
seldom
attained
except
by
the
old
there
is
such
an
one
i
sometimes
see
being
wheeled
about
in
the
luxembourg
his
face
is
beautiful
in
its
thankfulness
the
contented
man
how
good
god
is
to
me
he
said
for
have
i
not
a
mansion
tall
with
trees
and
lawns
of
velvet
tread
and
happy
helpers
at
my
call
with
beauty
is
my
life
abrim
with
tranquil
hours
and
dreams
apart
you
wonder
that
i
yield
to
him
that
best
of
prayers
a
grateful
heart
how
good
god
is
to
me
he
said
for
look
though
gone
is
all
my
wealth
how
sweet
it
is
to
earn
one
bread
with
brawny
arms
and
brimming
health
oh
now
i
know
the
joy
of
strife
to
sleep
so
sound
to
wake
so
fit
ah
yes
how
glorious
is
life
i
thank
him
for
each
day
of
it
how
good
god
is
to
me
he
said
though
health
and
wealth
are
gone
it
true
things
might
be
worse
i
might
be
dead
and
here
i
living
laughing
too
serene
beneath
the
evening
sky
i
wait
and
every
man
my
friend
god
most
contented
man
am
i
he
keeps
me
smiling
to
the
end
the
basin
of
the
luxembourg
is
bright
with
little
boats
hundreds
of
happy
children
romp
around
it
little
ones
everywhere
yet
there
is
no
other
city
with
so
many
childless
homes
the
spirit
of
the
unborn
babe
the
spirit
of
the
unborn
babe
peered
through
the
peered
through
the
that
glowed
like
beacon
in
the
night
for
oh
the
sky
was
desolate
and
wild
with
wind
and
rain
and
how
the
little
room
was
crammed
with
coziness
and
light
except
the
flirting
of
the
fire
there
was
no
sound
at
all
the
woman
sat
beside
the
hearth
her
knitting
on
her
knee
the
shadow
of
her
husband
head
was
dancing
on
the
wall
she
looked
with
staring
eyes
at
it
she
looked
yet
did
not
see
she
only
saw
a
childish
face
that
topped
the
table
rim
a
little
wistful
ghost
that
smiled
and
vanished
quick
away
and
then
because
her
tender
eyes
were
flooding
to
the
brim
she
lowered
her
do
sorrow
dear
she
heard
him
softly
say
it
over
now
we
try
to
be
as
happy
as
before
ah
they
who
little
children
have
grant
hostages
to
pain
we
gave
life
chance
to
wound
us
once
but
never
never
the
spirit
of
the
unborn
babe
fled
through
the
night
again
the
spirit
of
the
unborn
babe
went
wildered
in
the
dark
like
termagants
the
winds
tore
down
and
whirled
it
with
the
snow
and
then
amid
the
writhing
storm
it
saw
a
tiny
spark
a
window
broad
a
spacious
room
all
goldenly
aglow
a
woman
slim
and
and
exquisitely
fair
who
smiled
with
rapture
as
she
watched
her
jewels
catch
the
blaze
a
man
in
faultless
evening
dress
young
handsome
debonnaire
who
smoked
his
cigarette
and
looked
with
frank
admiring
gaze
oh
we
are
happy
sweet
said
he
youth
health
and
wealth
are
ours
what
if
a
thousand
toil
and
sweat
that
we
may
live
at
ease
what
if
the
hands
are
worn
and
torn
that
strew
our
path
with
flowers
ah
well
we
did
not
make
the
world
let
us
not
think
of
these
let
seek
the
of
earth
dear
heart
just
you
and
i
let
other
women
bring
forth
life
with
sorrow
and
with
pain
above
our
door
we
hang
the
sign
children
need
the
spirit
of
the
unborn
babe
sped
through
the
night
again
the
spirit
of
the
unborn
babe
went
whirling
on
and
on
it
soared
above
a
city
vast
it
swept
down
to
a
slum
it
saw
within
a
grimy
house
a
light
that
dimly
shone
it
peered
in
through
a
and
lo
a
voice
said
come
and
so
a
little
girl
was
born
amid
the
dirt
and
din
and
lived
in
spite
of
everything
for
life
is
ordered
so
a
child
whose
eyes
first
opened
wide
to
swinishness
and
sin
a
child
whose
love
and
innocence
met
only
curse
and
blow
and
so
in
due
and
proper
course
she
took
the
path
of
shame
and
gladly
died
in
hospital
quite
old
at
twenty
years
and
when
god
comes
to
weigh
it
all
ah
whose
shall
be
the
blame
for
all
her
maimed
and
poisoned
life
her
torture
and
her
tears
for
oh
it
is
not
what
we
do
but
what
we
have
not
done
and
on
that
day
of
reckoning
when
all
is
plain
and
clear
what
if
we
stand
before
the
throne
every
one
maybe
the
blackest
sins
of
all
are
selfishness
and
fear
iv
the
cafe
de
la
paix
august
paris
and
i
are
out
of
tune
as
i
sit
at
this
famous
corner
the
faint
breeze
is
stale
and
weary
stale
and
weary
too
the
faces
that
swirl
around
me
while
overhead
the
electric
sign
of
somebody
chocolate
appears
and
vanishes
with
irritating
insistency
the
very
trees
seem
artificial
gleaming
under
the
with
a
raw
virility
that
rasps
my
nerves
poor
little
trees
i
mutter
growing
in
all
this
grime
and
glare
your
only
dryads
the
loitering
ladies
with
the
complexions
of
such
brilliant
certainty
your
only
pipes
of
pan
orchestral
echoes
from
the
clamorous
cafes
exiles
of
the
forest
what
know
you
of
winds
of
sunsets
of
the
gentle
admonition
of
spring
rain
life
that
would
fain
be
a
melody
seems
here
almost
a
malady
i
crave
for
the
balm
of
nature
the
anodyne
of
solitude
the
breath
of
mother
earth
tell
me
o
wistful
trees
what
shall
i
do
then
that
stale
and
weary
wind
rustles
the
leaves
of
the
nearest
sycamore
and
i
am
sure
it
whispers
brittany
so
i
am
off
off
to
the
land
of
little
fields
finistère
hurrah
i
off
to
finistère
to
finistère
to
finistère
my
satchel
swinging
on
my
back
my
staff
is
in
my
hand
i
twenty
in
my
purse
i
know
the
sun
and
sea
are
there
and
so
i
starting
out
to
tramp
the
golden
land
i
go
alone
and
glorying
with
on
my
lips
a
song
of
joy
i
leave
behind
the
city
with
its
canker
and
its
care
i
swing
along
so
sturdily
oh
wo
i
be
the
happy
boy
on
the
rocky
roads
the
roads
of
finistère
oh
have
you
been
to
finistère
and
do
you
know
a
town
that
echoes
to
the
clatter
of
a
thousand
wooden
shoes
and
have
you
seen
the
go
gallivantin
up
and
down
and
watched
the
tawny
boats
go
out
and
heard
the
roaring
crews
oh
would
you
sit
with
pipe
and
bowl
and
dream
upon
some
sunny
quay
or
would
you
walk
the
windy
heath
and
drink
the
cooler
air
oh
would
you
seek
a
cradled
cove
and
tussle
with
the
topaz
sea
pack
up
your
kit
lad
and
haste
to
finistère
oh
i
will
go
to
finistère
there
nothing
that
can
hold
me
back
i
laugh
with
yves
and
léon
and
i
chaff
with
rose
and
jeanne
i
seek
the
little
quaint
that
kept
by
mother
merdrinaç
who
wears
a
cap
of
many
frills
and
swears
just
like
a
man
i
yarn
with
hearty
hairy
chaps
who
dance
and
leap
and
crack
their
heels
who
swallow
cupfuls
of
cognac
and
never
turn
a
hair
i
watch
the
boats
come
in
with
mullet
plaice
and
conger
eels
the
jeweled
harvest
of
the
sea
they
reap
in
finistère
yes
i
come
back
from
finistère
with
memories
of
shining
days
of
scaly
nets
and
salty
men
in
overalls
of
brown
of
ancient
women
knitting
as
they
watch
the
tethered
cattle
graze
by
little
nestling
beaches
where
the
gorse
goes
blazing
down
of
headlands
silvering
the
sea
of
calvarys
against
the
sky
of
scorn
of
angry
sunsets
and
of
carnac
grim
and
bare
oh
wo
i
have
the
leaping
veins
and
tawny
cheek
and
sparkling
eye
when
i
come
back
to
montparnasse
and
dream
of
finistère
days
behold
me
with
staff
and
scrip
footing
it
merrily
in
the
land
of
pardons
i
have
no
goal
when
i
am
weary
i
stop
at
some
when
i
am
rested
i
go
on
again
neither
do
i
put
any
constraint
on
my
spirit
no
subduing
of
the
mind
to
the
task
of
the
moment
i
dream
to
heart
content
my
dreams
stretch
into
the
future
i
see
myself
a
singer
of
simple
songs
a
laureate
of
the
i
will
write
books
a
score
of
them
i
will
voyage
far
and
wide
i
will
but
there
dreams
are
dangerous
they
waste
the
time
one
should
spend
in
making
them
come
true
yet
when
we
do
make
them
come
true
we
find
the
vision
sweeter
than
the
reality
how
much
of
our
happiness
do
we
owe
to
dreams
i
have
in
mind
one
old
chap
who
used
to
herd
the
sheep
on
my
uncle
farm
old
david
smail
he
dreamed
away
his
hours
in
school
he
sat
with
such
an
absent
air
the
master
reckoned
him
a
fool
and
gave
him
up
in
dull
despair
when
other
lads
were
making
hay
you
find
him
loafing
by
the
stream
he
take
a
book
and
slip
away
and
just
pretend
to
fish
and
dream
his
brothers
passed
him
in
the
race
they
climbed
the
hill
and
clutched
the
prize
he
did
not
seem
to
heed
his
face
was
tranquil
as
the
evening
skies
he
lived
apart
he
spoke
with
few
abstractedly
through
life
he
went
oh
what
he
dreamed
of
no
one
knew
and
yet
he
seemed
to
be
content
i
see
him
now
so
old
and
gray
his
eyes
with
inward
vision
dim
and
though
he
faltered
on
the
way
somehow
i
almost
envied
him
at
last
beside
his
bed
i
stood
and
is
life
done
so
soon
he
sighed
it
been
so
rich
so
full
so
good
i
loved
it
all
and
so
he
died
framed
in
hedgerows
of
emerald
the
wheat
glows
with
a
caloric
fervor
as
if
gorged
with
summer
heat
in
the
vivid
green
of
pastures
old
women
are
herding
cows
calm
and
patient
are
their
faces
as
with
gentle
industry
they
bend
over
their
knitting
one
feels
that
they
are
necessary
to
the
landscape
to
gaze
at
me
the
suspend
the
magnificent
lethargy
of
their
labors
the
men
with
the
reaping
hooks
improve
the
occasion
by
another
pull
at
the
cider
bottle
under
the
stook
the
women
raise
apathetic
brown
faces
from
the
sheaf
they
are
tying
every
one
is
a
study
in
deliberation
though
the
crop
is
russet
ripe
and
crying
to
be
cut
then
on
i
go
again
amid
high
banks
overgrown
with
fern
and
honeysuckle
sometimes
i
come
on
an
old
mill
that
seems
to
have
been
constructed
by
constable
so
charmingly
does
nature
imitate
art
by
the
deserted
house
half
drowned
in
greenery
the
velvety
wheel
dipping
in
the
crystal
water
seems
to
protest
against
this
prolongation
of
its
toil
then
again
i
come
on
its
brother
the
mill
of
the
wind
whirling
its
arms
so
cheerily
as
it
turns
its
great
white
stones
for
its
master
the
floury
miller
by
the
door
these
things
delight
me
i
am
in
a
land
where
time
has
lagged
where
simple
people
timorously
hug
the
past
how
far
away
now
seems
the
welter
and
swelter
of
the
city
the
hectic
sophistication
of
the
streets
the
sense
of
wonder
is
strong
in
me
again
the
joy
of
looking
at
familiar
things
as
if
one
were
seeing
them
for
the
first
time
the
wonderer
i
wish
that
i
could
understand
the
moving
marvel
of
my
hand
i
watch
my
fingers
turn
and
twist
the
supple
bending
of
my
wrist
the
dainty
touch
of
the
steel
intensity
of
grip
a
tool
of
exquisite
design
with
pride
i
think
it
mine
it
mine
then
there
the
wonder
of
my
eyes
where
hills
and
houses
seas
and
skies
in
waves
of
light
converge
and
pass
and
print
themselves
as
on
a
glass
line
form
and
color
live
in
me
i
am
the
beauty
that
i
see
ah
i
could
write
a
book
of
size
about
the
wonder
of
my
eyes
what
of
the
wonder
of
my
heart
that
plays
so
faithfully
its
part
i
hear
it
running
sound
and
sweet
it
does
not
seem
to
miss
a
beat
between
the
cradle
and
the
grave
it
never
falters
stanch
and
brave
alas
i
wish
i
had
the
art
to
tell
the
wonder
of
my
heart
then
oh
but
how
can
i
explain
the
wondrous
wonder
of
my
brain
that
marvelous
machine
that
brings
all
consciousness
of
wonderings
that
lets
me
from
myself
leap
out
and
watch
my
body
walk
about
it
hopeless
all
my
words
are
vain
to
tell
the
wonder
of
my
brain
but
do
not
think
o
patient
friend
who
reads
these
stanzas
to
the
end
that
i
myself
would
you
just
as
wonderful
as
i
and
all
creation
in
our
view
is
quite
as
marvelous
as
you
come
let
us
on
the
stand
and
wonder
at
a
grain
of
sand
and
then
into
the
meadow
pass
and
marvel
at
a
blade
of
grass
or
cast
our
vision
high
and
far
and
thrill
with
wonder
at
a
star
a
host
of
stars
night
holy
tent
with
wonderment
if
wonder
is
in
great
and
small
then
what
of
him
who
made
it
all
in
eyes
and
brain
and
heart
and
limb
let
see
the
wondrous
work
of
him
in
house
and
hill
and
sward
and
sea
in
bird
and
beast
and
flower
and
tree
in
everything
from
sun
to
sod
the
wonder
and
the
awe
of
god
august
for
some
time
the
way
has
been
growing
wilder
thickset
hedges
have
yielded
to
dykes
of
stone
and
there
is
every
sign
that
i
am
approaching
the
rugged
region
of
the
coast
at
each
point
of
vantage
i
can
see
a
cross
often
a
relic
of
the
early
christians
stumpy
and
corroded
then
i
come
on
a
slab
of
gray
stone
upstanding
about
fifteen
feet
like
a
sentinel
on
that
solitary
plain
it
overwhelms
me
with
a
sense
of
mystery
but
as
i
go
on
through
this
desolate
land
these
stones
become
more
and
more
familiar
like
soldiers
they
stand
in
rank
extending
over
the
moor
the
sky
is
cowled
with
cloud
save
where
a
sullen
sunset
shoots
rays
across
the
plain
bathed
in
that
sinister
light
stands
my
army
of
stone
and
a
wind
swooping
down
seems
to
wail
amid
its
ranks
as
in
a
glass
darkly
i
can
see
the
men
the
women
with
their
tangled
hair
the
feast
the
cowering
terror
of
the
night
then
the
sunset
is
cut
off
suddenly
and
a
clammy
mist
shrouds
that
silent
army
so
it
is
almost
with
a
shudder
i
take
my
last
look
at
the
stones
of
carnac
but
now
my
pilgrimage
is
drawing
to
an
end
a
painter
friend
who
lives
by
the
sea
has
asked
me
to
stay
with
him
awhile
well
i
have
walked
a
hundred
miles
singing
on
the
way
i
have
dreamed
and
dawdled
planned
exulted
i
have
drunk
buckets
of
cider
and
eaten
many
an
omelette
that
seemed
like
a
golden
glorification
of
its
egg
it
has
all
been
very
sweet
but
it
will
also
be
sweet
to
loaf
awhile
oh
it
is
good
oh
it
is
good
to
drink
and
sup
and
then
beside
the
kindly
fire
to
smoke
and
heap
the
faggots
up
and
rest
and
dream
to
heart
desire
oh
it
is
good
to
ride
and
run
to
roam
the
greenwood
wild
and
free
to
hunt
to
idle
in
the
sun
to
leap
into
the
laughing
sea
oh
it
is
good
with
hand
and
brain
to
gladly
till
the
chosen
soil
and
after
honest
sweat
and
strain
to
see
the
harvest
of
one
toil
oh
it
is
good
afar
to
roam
and
seek
adventure
in
strange
lands
yet
oh
so
good
the
coming
home
the
velvet
love
of
little
hands
so
much
is
we
thank
thee
god
for
all
the
tokens
thou
hast
given
that
here
on
earth
our
feet
have
trod
thy
little
shining
trails
of
heaven
v
august
i
am
living
in
a
little
house
so
near
the
sea
that
at
high
tide
i
can
see
on
my
bedroom
wall
the
reflected
ripple
of
the
water
at
night
i
waken
to
the
melodious
welter
of
waves
or
maybe
there
is
a
great
stillness
and
then
i
know
that
the
sand
and
are
lying
naked
to
the
moon
but
soon
the
tide
returns
and
once
more
i
hear
the
roistering
of
the
waves
calvert
my
friend
is
a
lover
as
well
as
a
painter
of
nature
he
rises
with
the
dawn
to
see
the
morning
mist
kindle
to
coral
and
the
sun
edge
clear
the
as
he
munches
his
coarse
bread
and
sips
his
white
wine
what
dreams
are
his
beneath
the
magic
changes
of
the
sky
he
will
paint
the
same
scene
under
a
dozen
conditions
of
light
he
has
looked
so
long
for
beauty
that
he
has
come
to
see
it
everywhere
i
love
this
friendly
home
of
his
a
peace
steals
over
my
spirit
and
i
feel
as
if
i
could
stay
here
always
some
day
i
hope
that
i
too
may
have
such
an
one
and
that
i
may
write
like
this
i
have
some
friends
i
have
some
friends
some
worthy
friends
and
worthy
friends
are
rare
these
carpet
slippers
on
my
feet
that
padded
leather
chair
this
old
and
shabby
so
well
the
worse
of
wear
i
have
some
friends
some
honest
friends
and
honest
friends
are
few
my
pipe
of
briar
my
open
fire
a
book
that
not
too
new
my
bed
so
warm
the
nights
of
storm
i
love
to
listen
to
i
have
some
friends
some
good
good
friends
who
faithful
are
to
me
my
wrestling
partner
when
i
rise
the
big
and
burly
sea
my
little
boat
that
riding
there
so
saucy
and
so
free
i
have
some
friends
some
golden
friends
whose
worth
will
not
decline
a
tawny
irish
terrier
a
purple
shading
pine
a
little
cottage
that
so
proudly
i
call
mine
all
other
friends
may
come
and
go
all
other
friendships
fail
but
these
the
friends
i
worked
to
win
oh
they
will
never
stale
and
comfort
me
till
time
shall
write
the
finish
to
my
tale
calvert
tries
to
paint
more
than
the
thing
he
sees
he
tries
to
paint
behind
it
to
express
its
spirit
he
believes
that
beauty
is
god
made
manifest
and
that
when
we
discover
him
in
nature
we
discover
him
in
ourselves
but
calvert
did
not
always
see
thus
at
one
time
he
was
a
pagan
content
to
paint
the
outward
aspect
of
things
it
was
after
his
little
child
died
he
gained
in
vision
maybe
the
thought
that
the
dead
are
lost
to
us
was
too
unbearable
he
had
to
believe
in
a
coming
together
again
the
quest
i
sought
him
on
the
purple
seas
i
sought
him
on
the
peaks
aflame
amid
the
gloom
of
giant
trees
and
canyons
lone
i
called
his
name
the
wasted
ways
of
earth
i
trod
in
vain
in
vain
i
found
not
god
i
sought
him
in
the
hives
of
men
the
cities
grand
the
hamlets
gray
the
temples
old
beyond
my
ken
the
tabernacles
of
all
life
that
is
from
cloud
to
clod
i
alas
i
found
not
god
then
after
roamings
far
and
wide
in
streets
and
seas
and
deserts
wild
i
came
to
stand
at
last
beside
the
of
my
little
child
lo
as
i
bent
beneath
the
rod
i
raised
my
eyes
and
there
was
god
a
golden
mile
of
sand
swings
between
two
tusks
of
rock
the
sea
is
sleeping
sapphire
that
wakes
to
cream
and
crash
upon
the
beach
there
is
a
majesty
in
the
detachment
of
its
lazy
waves
and
it
is
good
in
the
night
to
hear
its
friendly
roar
good
too
to
leap
forth
with
the
first
sunshine
and
fall
into
its
arms
to
let
it
pummel
the
body
to
living
ecstasy
and
send
one
to
breakfast
and
glowing
behind
the
house
the
greensward
slopes
to
a
that
is
like
a
wall
of
gold
here
i
lie
and
laze
away
the
time
or
dip
into
a
favorite
book
stevenson
or
belloc
to
bees
drone
in
the
wild
thyme
a
cuckoo
keeps
calling
a
lark
spills
jeweled
melody
then
there
is
a
seeming
silence
but
it
is
the
silence
of
a
deeper
sound
after
all
silence
is
only
man
confession
of
his
deafness
like
death
like
eternity
it
is
a
word
that
means
nothing
so
lying
there
i
hear
the
breathing
of
the
trees
the
crepitation
of
the
growing
grass
the
seething
of
the
sap
and
the
movements
of
innumerable
insects
strange
how
i
think
with
distaste
of
the
spurious
glitter
of
paris
of
my
garret
even
of
my
poor
little
book
i
watch
the
wife
of
my
friend
gathering
poppies
in
the
wheat
there
is
a
sadness
in
her
face
for
it
is
only
a
year
ago
they
lost
their
little
one
often
i
see
her
steal
away
to
the
village
graveyard
sitting
silent
for
long
and
long
the
comforter
as
i
sat
by
my
baby
bed
that
open
to
the
sky
there
fluttered
round
and
round
my
head
a
radiant
butterfly
and
as
i
wept
of
hearts
that
ache
the
saddest
in
the
land
it
left
a
lily
for
my
sake
and
lighted
on
my
hand
i
watched
it
oh
so
quietly
and
though
it
rose
and
flew
as
if
it
fain
would
comfort
me
it
came
and
came
anew
now
where
my
darling
lies
at
rest
i
do
not
dare
to
sigh
for
look
there
gleams
upon
my
breast
a
butterfly
my
friends
will
have
other
children
and
if
some
day
they
should
read
this
piece
of
verse
perhaps
they
will
think
of
the
city
lad
who
used
to
sit
under
the
old
in
the
garden
and
watch
the
lizards
sun
themselves
on
the
wall
the
other
one
gather
around
me
children
dear
the
wind
is
high
and
the
night
is
cold
closer
little
ones
snuggle
near
let
seek
a
story
of
ages
old
a
magic
tale
of
a
bygone
day
of
lovely
ladies
and
dragons
dread
come
for
you
all
so
tired
of
play
we
read
till
it
time
to
go
to
bed
so
they
all
are
glad
and
they
nestle
in
and
squat
on
the
rough
old
nursery
rug
and
they
nudge
and
hush
as
i
begin
and
the
fire
leaps
up
and
all
so
snug
and
there
i
sit
in
the
big
and
how
they
are
eager
and
sweet
and
wise
and
they
cup
their
chins
in
their
hands
and
stare
at
the
heart
of
the
flame
with
thoughtful
eyes
and
then
as
i
read
by
the
ruddy
glow
and
the
little
ones
sit
entranced
and
still
drawing
near
ah
i
know
i
know
he
listening
too
as
he
always
will
he
there
he
standing
beside
my
knee
i
see
him
so
well
my
wee
wee
oh
children
dear
do
look
at
me
i
reading
now
for
the
other
one
for
the
firelight
glints
in
his
golden
hair
and
his
wondering
eyes
are
fixed
on
my
face
and
he
rests
on
the
arm
of
my
and
the
book
a
blur
and
i
lose
my
place
and
i
touch
my
lips
to
his
shining
head
and
my
voice
breaks
down
and
the
story
oh
children
kiss
me
and
go
to
bed
leave
me
to
think
of
the
other
one
of
the
one
who
will
never
grow
up
at
all
who
will
always
be
just
a
child
at
play
tender
and
trusting
and
sweet
and
small
who
will
never
leave
me
and
go
away
who
will
never
hurt
me
and
give
me
pain
who
will
comfort
me
when
i
all
alone
a
heart
of
love
that
without
a
stain
always
and
always
my
own
my
own
yet
a
thought
shines
out
from
the
dark
of
pain
and
it
gives
me
hope
to
be
reconciled
each
of
us
must
be
born
again
and
live
and
die
as
a
little
child
so
that
with
souls
all
shining
white
white
as
snow
and
without
one
sin
we
may
come
to
the
gates
of
eternal
light
where
only
children
may
enter
so
gentle
mothers
do
ever
grieve
because
you
have
lost
but
kiss
the
rod
from
the
depths
of
your
woe
be
glad
believe
you
given
an
angel
unto
god
rejoice
you
a
child
whose
youth
endures
who
comes
to
you
when
the
day
is
done
wistful
for
love
oh
yours
just
yours
dearest
of
all
the
other
one
catastrophe
brittany
august
and
now
i
fear
i
must
write
in
another
strain
up
to
this
time
i
have
been
too
happy
i
have
existed
in
a
magic
bohemia
largely
of
my
own
making
hope
faith
enthusiasm
have
been
mine
each
day
has
had
its
struggle
its
failure
its
triumph
however
that
is
all
ended
during
the
past
week
we
have
lived
breathlessly
for
in
spite
of
the
exultant
sunshine
our
spirits
have
been
under
a
cloud
a
deepening
shadow
of
horror
and
war
even
as
i
write
in
our
little
village
steeple
the
bells
are
ringing
madly
and
in
every
little
village
steeple
all
over
the
land
as
he
hears
it
the
harvester
checks
his
scythe
on
the
swing
the
clerk
throws
down
his
pen
the
shopkeeper
puts
up
his
shutters
only
in
the
cafes
there
is
a
clamor
of
voices
and
a
drowning
of
care
for
here
every
man
must
fight
every
home
give
tribute
there
is
no
question
no
appeal
by
heredity
and
discipline
all
minds
are
shaped
to
this
great
hour
so
each
man
will
seek
his
barracks
and
become
a
soldier
as
completely
as
if
he
had
never
been
anything
else
with
the
same
docility
as
he
dons
his
baggy
red
trousers
will
he
let
some
general
hurl
him
to
destruction
for
some
dubious
gain
a
father
a
fodder
for
cannon
so
they
all
go
without
hesitation
without
bitterness
and
the
great
military
machine
that
knows
not
humanity
swings
them
to
their
fate
i
marvel
at
the
sense
of
duty
the
resignation
the
sacrifice
it
is
magnificent
it
is
france
and
the
women
those
who
wait
and
weep
ah
i
have
not
seen
one
who
did
not
weep
yes
one
she
was
very
old
and
she
stood
by
her
garden
gate
with
her
hand
on
the
uplifted
latch
as
i
passed
she
looked
at
me
with
eyes
that
did
not
see
she
had
no
doubt
sons
and
grandsons
who
must
fight
and
she
had
good
reason
perhaps
to
remember
the
war
of
when
i
passed
an
hour
later
she
was
still
there
her
hand
on
the
uplifted
latch
august
the
men
have
gone
only
remain
graybeards
women
and
children
calvert
and
i
have
been
helping
our
neighbors
to
get
in
the
harvest
no
doubt
we
aid
but
there
with
the
old
men
and
children
a
sense
of
uneasiness
and
even
shame
comes
over
me
i
would
like
to
return
to
paris
but
the
railway
is
mobilized
each
day
i
grow
more
discontented
up
there
in
the
red
north
great
things
are
doing
and
i
am
out
of
it
i
am
thoroughly
unhappy
then
calvert
comes
to
me
with
a
plan
he
has
a
ford
car
we
will
all
three
go
to
paris
he
intends
to
offer
himself
and
his
car
to
the
red
cross
his
wife
will
nurse
so
we
are
very
happy
at
the
solution
and
we
are
off
paris
back
again
closed
shutters
deserted
streets
how
glum
everything
is
those
who
are
not
mobilized
seem
uncertain
how
to
turn
every
one
buys
the
papers
and
reads
grimly
of
disaster
no
news
is
bad
news
i
go
to
my
garret
as
to
a
beloved
friend
everything
is
just
as
i
left
it
so
that
it
seems
i
have
never
been
away
i
sigh
with
relief
and
joy
i
will
take
up
my
work
again
serene
above
the
storm
i
will
watch
and
wait
although
i
have
been
brought
up
in
england
i
am
american
born
my
country
is
not
concerned
so
going
to
the
dôme
cafe
i
seek
some
of
my
comrades
strange
they
have
gone
macbean
i
am
told
is
in
england
by
dyeing
his
hair
and
lying
about
his
age
he
has
managed
to
enlist
in
the
seaforth
highlanders
saxon
dane
too
he
has
joined
the
foreign
legion
and
even
now
may
be
fighting
well
let
them
go
i
will
keep
out
of
the
mess
but
why
did
they
go
i
wish
i
knew
war
is
murder
criminal
folly
against
humanity
imperialism
is
at
the
root
of
it
we
are
fools
and
dupes
yes
i
will
think
and
write
of
other
has
i
hate
violence
i
would
not
willingly
cause
pain
to
anything
breathing
i
would
rather
be
killed
than
kill
i
will
stand
above
the
battle
and
watch
it
from
afar
is
in
the
foreign
how
disturbing
it
all
is
one
can
not
settle
down
to
anything
every
day
i
meet
men
who
tell
the
most
wonderful
stories
in
the
most
casual
way
i
envy
them
i
too
want
to
have
experiences
to
live
where
life
beat
is
most
intense
but
that
a
poor
reason
for
going
to
war
and
yet
though
i
shrink
from
the
idea
of
fighting
i
might
in
some
way
help
those
who
are
macbean
and
dane
for
example
sitting
lonely
in
the
dôme
i
seem
to
see
their
ghosts
in
the
corner
macbean
listening
with
his
keen
sarcastic
smile
saxon
dane
banging
his
great
hairy
fist
on
the
table
till
the
glasses
jump
where
are
they
now
living
a
life
that
i
will
never
know
when
they
come
back
if
they
ever
do
shall
i
not
feel
shamed
in
their
presence
oh
this
filthy
war
things
were
going
on
so
beautifully
we
were
all
so
happy
so
full
of
ambition
of
hope
laughing
and
talking
over
pipe
and
bowl
and
in
our
garrets
seeking
to
realize
our
dreams
ah
these
days
will
never
come
again
then
as
i
sit
there
calvert
seeks
me
out
he
has
joined
an
ambulance
corps
that
is
going
to
the
front
will
i
come
in
yes
i
say
i
do
anything
so
it
is
all
settled
i
give
up
my
freedom
book
four
winter
i
the
somme
front
january
there
is
an
avenue
of
noble
beeches
leading
to
the
chateau
and
in
the
shadow
of
each
glimmers
the
pale
oblong
of
an
ambulance
we
have
to
keep
them
thus
concealed
for
only
yesterday
morning
a
taube
flew
over
the
beggars
are
rather
partial
to
red
cross
cars
one
of
our
chaps
taking
in
a
load
of
wounded
was
chased
and
pelted
the
other
day
the
chateau
seems
all
spires
and
towers
the
glorified
dream
of
a
parisian
pastrycook
on
its
terrace
figures
in
khaki
are
lounging
they
are
the
volunteers
the
of
the
corps
many
of
them
men
of
wealth
and
title
curious
to
see
one
who
owns
all
the
coal
in
two
counties
proudly
signing
for
his
a
day
or
another
who
lives
in
a
fifth
avenue
palace
contentedly
sleeping
on
the
floor
of
a
hovel
here
is
a
rhyme
i
have
made
of
such
an
one
priscilla
jerry
macmullen
the
millionaire
driving
a
bus
out
there
how
did
he
win
his
de
bless
you
that
all
old
stuff
beast
of
a
night
on
the
verdun
road
jerry
stuck
with
a
woeful
load
stalled
in
the
mud
where
the
red
lights
glowed
prospect
devilish
tough
little
priscilla
he
called
his
car
best
of
our
battered
bunch
by
far
branded
with
many
a
bullet
scar
yet
running
so
sweet
and
true
jerry
he
loved
her
knew
her
tricks
swore
she
the
beat
of
the
best
big
six
and
if
ever
i
get
in
a
deuce
of
a
fix
priscilla
will
pull
me
through
looks
pretty
rotten
right
now
says
he
hanged
if
the
devil
himself
could
see
priscilla
it
up
to
you
and
me
to
show
what
we
can
do
seemed
that
priscilla
just
took
the
word
up
with
a
leap
like
a
horse
that
spurred
on
with
the
joy
of
a
homing
bird
swift
as
the
wind
she
flew
shoot
at
them
out
of
the
night
a
lurch
to
the
left
a
wrench
to
the
right
hands
and
teeth
clenched
tight
eyes
that
glare
through
the
dark
priscilla
you
doing
me
proud
this
day
hospital
only
a
league
away
and
honey
i
longing
to
hit
the
hay
so
hurry
old
but
hark
howl
of
a
shell
harsh
sudden
dread
another
strike
me
dead
if
the
huns
ai
strafing
the
road
ahead
so
the
convoy
ca
get
through
a
barrage
of
shrap
and
us
alone
four
you
hear
moan
fierce
old
messes
of
blood
and
priscilla
what
shall
we
do
again
it
seems
that
priscilla
hears
with
a
rush
and
a
roar
her
way
she
clears
straight
at
the
hell
of
flame
she
steers
full
at
its
heart
of
wrath
fury
of
death
and
dust
and
din
havoc
and
horror
she
in
she
in
she
almost
over
she
win
she
win
crump
right
in
the
path
little
priscilla
skids
and
stops
jerry
macmullen
sways
and
flops
bang
in
his
map
the
crash
he
cops
shriek
from
the
car
mon
dieu
one
of
the
hears
him
say
just
at
the
moment
he
faints
away
reckon
this
is
my
lucky
day
priscilla
it
up
to
you
sergeant
raps
on
the
doctor
door
car
in
the
court
with
four
driver
dead
on
the
dashboard
floor
strange
how
the
bunch
got
here
no
says
the
doc
this
chap
alive
but
tell
me
how
could
a
man
contrive
with
both
arms
broken
a
car
to
drive
thunder
of
god
it
queer
same
little
makes
a
spiel
says
he
when
i
saw
our
driver
reel
a
strange
shape
leapt
to
the
driving
wheel
and
sped
us
safe
through
the
night
but
jerry
he
says
in
his
drawling
tone
rats
why
priscilla
came
in
on
her
own
bless
her
she
did
it
alone
if
i
know
who
as
i
am
sitting
down
to
my
midday
meal
an
orderly
gives
me
a
telegram
two
couchés
send
car
at
the
uptilted
is
a
of
green
and
gray
and
except
where
groves
of
trees
rise
like
islands
cultivated
to
the
last
acre
but
as
we
near
the
all
efforts
to
till
the
land
cease
and
the
ungathered
beets
of
last
year
have
grown
to
seed
amid
rank
unkempt
fields
i
race
over
a
road
that
is
pitted
with
i
pass
a
line
of
guns
painted
like
snakes
and
drawn
by
horses
dyed
color
then
soldiers
coming
from
the
trenches
and
ineffably
weary
then
a
race
over
a
bit
of
road
that
is
exposed
then
buried
in
the
the
dressing
station
the
two
wounded
are
put
into
my
car
from
hip
to
heel
one
is
swathed
in
bandages
the
other
has
a
great
white
turban
on
his
head
with
a
red
patch
on
it
that
spreads
and
spreads
they
stare
dully
but
make
no
sound
as
i
crank
the
car
there
is
a
shrill
screaming
about
thirty
yards
away
i
hear
an
explosion
like
a
followed
by
a
sudden
belch
of
smoke
i
stare
at
it
in
a
dazed
way
then
the
doctor
says
do
trouble
to
analyze
your
sensations
better
get
off
you
only
drawing
their
fire
here
is
one
of
my
experiences
a
casualty
that
boy
i
took
in
the
car
last
night
with
the
body
that
awfully
sagged
away
and
the
lips
and
the
eyes
and
the
poor
hands
folded
and
cold
as
clay
oh
i
thought
and
i
thought
of
him
all
the
day
for
the
weary
old
doctor
says
to
me
he
only
last
for
an
hour
or
so
both
of
his
legs
below
the
knee
blown
off
by
a
so
lad
go
slow
and
please
remember
he
does
know
so
i
tried
to
drive
with
never
a
jar
and
there
was
i
cursing
the
road
like
mad
when
i
hears
a
ghost
of
a
voice
from
the
car
tell
me
old
chap
have
i
it
bad
so
i
answers
no
and
he
says
i
glad
glad
says
he
for
at
life
so
splendid
i
hate
to
go
there
so
much
good
that
a
chap
might
do
and
i
fought
from
the
start
and
i
suffered
so
be
hard
to
get
knocked
out
now
you
know
forget
it
says
i
then
i
drove
awhile
and
i
passed
him
a
cheery
word
or
two
but
he
did
answer
for
many
a
mile
so
just
as
the
hospital
hove
in
view
says
i
is
there
nothing
that
i
can
do
then
he
opens
his
eyes
and
he
smiles
at
me
and
he
takes
my
hand
in
his
trembling
hold
thank
you
you
far
too
kind
says
he
i
awfully
comfy
stay
let
see
i
fancy
my
blanket
come
unrolled
my
please
wrap
they
cold
they
cold
there
is
a
city
that
glitters
on
the
plain
afar
off
we
can
see
its
tall
cathedral
spire
and
there
we
often
take
our
wounded
from
the
little
village
hospitals
to
the
tragic
little
buildings
these
emergency
hospitals
churches
schools
their
cots
are
never
empty
their
surgeons
never
still
so
every
day
we
get
our
list
of
cases
and
off
we
go
a
long
line
of
cars
swishing
through
the
mud
then
one
by
one
we
branch
off
to
our
village
hospital
puzzling
out
the
road
on
our
maps
arrived
there
we
load
up
quickly
the
wounded
make
no
moan
they
lie
limp
heavily
bandaged
with
bare
legs
and
arms
protruding
from
their
blankets
they
do
not
know
where
they
are
going
they
do
not
care
like
live
stock
they
are
labeled
and
numbered
an
orderly
brings
along
their
equipment
throwing
open
their
rifles
to
see
that
no
charge
remains
sometimes
they
shake
our
hands
and
thank
us
for
the
drive
in
the
streets
of
the
city
i
see
french
soldiers
wearing
the
it
is
a
cord
of
green
yellow
or
red
and
corresponds
to
the
de
the
and
the
legion
of
honor
the
red
is
the
highest
of
all
and
has
been
granted
only
to
one
or
two
regiments
this
incident
was
told
to
me
by
a
man
who
saw
it
the
what
was
the
blackest
sight
to
me
of
all
that
campaign
naked
woman
tied
to
a
tree
with
jagged
holes
where
her
breasts
should
be
rotting
there
in
the
on
we
pressed
to
the
battle
fray
dogged
and
dour
and
spent
sudden
i
heard
my
captain
say
kultur
has
passed
this
way
and
left
us
a
monument
so
i
looked
and
i
saw
our
colonel
there
and
his
grand
head
snowed
with
the
years
unto
the
beat
of
the
rain
was
bare
and
oh
there
was
grief
in
his
frozen
stare
and
his
cheeks
were
stung
with
tears
then
at
last
he
turned
from
the
woeful
tree
and
his
face
like
stone
was
set
go
march
the
regiment
past
said
he
that
every
father
and
son
may
see
and
none
may
ever
forget
oh
the
crimson
strands
of
her
hair
downpoured
over
her
breasts
of
woe
and
our
grim
old
colonel
leaned
on
his
sword
and
the
men
filed
past
with
their
rifles
lowered
solemn
and
sad
and
slow
but
i
never
forget
till
the
day
i
die
as
i
stood
in
the
driving
rain
and
the
jaded
columns
of
men
slouched
by
how
amazement
leapt
into
every
eye
then
fury
and
grief
and
pain
and
some
would
like
madmen
stand
aghast
with
their
hands
upclenched
to
the
sky
and
some
would
cross
themselves
as
they
passed
and
some
would
curse
in
a
scalding
blast
and
some
like
children
cry
yea
some
would
be
sobbing
and
some
would
pray
and
some
hurl
hateful
names
but
the
best
had
never
a
word
to
say
they
turned
their
twitching
faces
away
and
their
eyes
were
like
hot
flames
they
passed
then
down
on
his
bended
knee
the
colonel
dropped
to
the
dead
poor
martyred
daughter
of
france
said
he
o
dearly
dearly
avenged
you
be
or
ever
a
day
be
sped
now
they
hold
that
we
are
the
best
of
the
best
and
each
of
our
men
may
wear
like
a
gash
of
crimson
across
his
chest
as
one
in
the
the
for
each
as
he
leaps
to
the
top
can
see
like
an
etching
of
blood
on
his
brain
a
wife
or
a
mother
lashed
to
a
tree
with
two
black
holes
where
her
breasts
should
be
left
to
rot
in
the
rain
so
we
fight
like
fiends
and
of
us
they
say
that
we
neither
yield
nor
spare
oh
we
have
the
bitterest
debt
to
have
we
paid
it
look
how
we
wear
like
a
trophy
gallant
and
proud
and
gay
our
it
is
often
weary
waiting
at
the
little
de
some
of
us
play
solitaire
some
read
a
sixpenny
some
doze
or
try
to
talk
in
bad
french
to
the
around
us
is
discomfort
dirt
and
drama
for
my
part
i
pass
the
time
only
too
quickly
trying
to
put
into
verse
the
incidents
and
ideas
that
come
my
way
in
this
way
i
hope
to
collect
quite
a
lot
of
stuff
which
may
some
day
see
itself
in
print
here
is
one
of
my
efforts
jim
never
knew
jim
did
you
our
boy
jim
bless
you
there
was
the
likely
lad
supple
and
straight
and
long
of
limb
clean
as
a
whistle
and
just
as
glad
always
laughing
was
he
dad
joy

joy
to
the
heart
of
him
and
oh
but
the
soothering
ways

best
as
a
tiny
tot
a
bonny
babe

laughing
there
in
his
little
cot
with
his
sunny
hair
and
his
apple
cheeks
and
my
but
the
blue
blue
eyes
he
got
and
just
where
his
wee
mouth
dimpled

such
a
fairy
mark
like
a
beauty
spot
that
was
jim
oh
the
war
the
war
how
my
eyes
were
wet
but
he
says

sorrowing

me
to
fail
you
yet
and
i
be
back

a
year
a
year

at
mons
he
fell
in
the
first
attack

their
eyes
were
dim
but
i
laughed
in
their
faces
he
come
back
will
my
jim
now

been
wedded
for
twenty
year
and
jim

the
only

new
little
see

going
to
call

laughing
there
in
the
same
old
way
in
his
tiny
cot
with
his
rosy
cheeks
and
his
sunny
hair
and
look
just
look
his
beauty
spot
in
the
selfsame
oh
i
ca

and
of

a
mother

but
i
know
i
know
it
my
boy
again
same
wee
jim
just

back
as
he
said
he
would
come
with
his
love
and
his
heart
of
glee
oh
i

and
i
cried
but
the
lord
was
good
from
the
shadow
of
death
he
set
jim
free
so
i
have
him
all
over
again
you
see
can
you
wonder
my
oh
how
happy
we
going
to
be
are
we
jim
ii
in
picardy
january
the
road
lies
amid
a
malevolent
heath
it
seems
to
lead
us
right
into
the
clutch
of
the
enemy
for
the
that
at
first
were
bursting
overhead
gradually
encircle
us
the
fields
are
strangely
sinister
the
splintered
trees
are
like
giant
toothpicks
there
is
a
lisping
and
a
twanging
overhead
as
we
wait
at
the
door
of
the
dugout
that
serves
as
a
dressing
station
i
gaze
up
into
that
mysterious
dark
so
alive
with
musical
vibrations
then
a
small
shadow
detaches
itself
from
the
greater
shadow
and
a
sentry
says
to
me
you
better
come
in
out
of
the
bullets
so
i
keep
under
cover
and
presently
they
bring
my
load
two
men
drip
with
sweat
as
they
carry
their
comrade
i
can
see
that
they
all
three
belong
to
the
foreign
legion
i
think
for
a
moment
of
saxon
dane
how
strange
if
some
day
i
should
carry
him
half
fearfully
i
look
at
my
passenger
but
he
is
a
black
man
such
things
only
happen
in
fiction
this
is
what
i
have
written
of
the
finest
troops
in
the
army
of
france
kelly
of
the
legion
now
kelly
was
no
fighter
he
loved
his
pipe
and
glass
an
easygoing
blighter
who
lived
in
montparnasse
but
the
tavern
tattle
he
heard
some
guinney
say
when
france
goes
forth
to
battle
the
legion
leads
the
way
the
scourings
of
creation
of
every
sin
and
station
the
men
who
known
damnation
are
picked
to
lead
the
way
well
kelly
joined
the
legion
they
marched
him
day
and
night
they
rushed
him
to
the
region
where
largest
loomed
the
fight
behold
your
mighty
mission
your
destiny
said
they
by
glorious
tradition
the
legion
leads
the
way
with
tattered
banners
flying
with
trail
of
dead
and
dying
on
on
all
hell
defying
the
legion
sweeps
the
way
with
grim
faces
with
jests
of
savage
mirth
they
swept
into
their
places
the
men
of
iron
worth
their
blooded
steel
was
flashing
they
swung
to
face
the
fray
then
rushing
roaring
crashing
the
legion
cleared
the
way
trail
they
blazed
was
gory
few
lived
to
tell
the
story
through
death
they
plunged
to
glory
but
oh
they
cleared
the
way
now
kelly
lay
and
dimly
saw
advance
with
split
new
banners
flying
the
of
france
then
up
amid
the
he
rose
from
where
he
lay
come
on
me
boys
says
kelly
the
layjun
lades
the
way
while
they
faltered
doubting
such
flames
of
doom
were
spouting
he
caught
them
thrilled
them
shouting
the
layjun
lades
the
way
they
saw
him
slip
and
stumble
then
stagger
on
once
more
they
marked
him
trip
and
tumble
a
mass
of
grime
and
gore
they
watched
him
blindly
crawling
amid
hell
own
affray
and
calling
calling
calling
the
layjun
lades
the
way
even
while
they
wondered
the
was
sundered
to
victory
they
thundered
but
kelly
led
the
still
kelly
kept
agoing
he
ran
his
eyes
with
fury
glowing
a
lion
of
a
man
his
rifle
madly
swinging
his
soul
athirst
to
slay
his
slogan
ringing
ringing
the
layjun
lades
the
way
in
a
pit
where
huns
with
maxims
waited
he
plunged
and
there
to
death
he
stabbed
his
now
kelly
was
a
fellow
who
simply
loathed
a
fight
he
loved
a
tavern
mellow
grog
hot
and
pipe
alight
i
sure
the
show
appalled
him
and
yet
without
dismay
when
death
and
duty
called
him
he
up
and
led
the
way
in
valhalla
drinking
if
heroes
meek
and
shrinking
are
suffered
there
i
thinking
is
kelly
leads
the
we
have
just
had
one
of
our
men
killed
a
young
sculptor
of
immense
promise
when
one
thinks
of
all
the
fine
work
he
might
have
accomplished
it
seems
a
shame
but
after
all
it
may
be
the
turn
of
any
of
us
if
it
should
be
mine
my
chief
regret
will
be
for
work
undone
ah
i
often
think
of
how
i
will
go
back
to
the
quarter
and
take
up
the
old
life
again
how
sweet
it
will
all
seem
but
first
i
must
earn
the
right
and
if
ever
i
do
go
back
how
i
will
find
bohemia
changed
missing
how
many
a
face
it
was
in
thinking
of
our
lost
comrade
i
wrote
the
following
the
three
tommies
that
barret
the
painter
of
pictures
what
feeling
for
color
he
had
and
fanning
the
maker
of
music
such
melodies
mirthful
and
mad
and
harley
the
writer
of
stories
so
whimsical
tender
and
glad
to
hark
to
their
talk
in
the
trenches
high
heart
unfolding
to
heart
of
the
day
when
the
war
would
be
over
and
each
would
be
true
to
his
part
upbuilding
a
palace
of
beauty
to
the
wonder
and
glory
of
art
yon
barret
the
painter
of
pictures
yon
carcass
that
rots
on
the
wire
his
hand
with
its
sensitive
cunning
is
crisped
to
a
cinder
with
fire
his
eyes
with
their
magical
vision
are
bubbles
of
glutinous
mire
poor
fanning
he
sought
to
discover
the
symphonic
note
of
a
shell
there
are
bits
of
him
broken
and
bloody
to
show
you
the
place
where
he
fell
i
reason
to
fear
on
his
exquisite
ear
the
rats
have
been
banqueting
well
and
speaking
of
harley
the
writer
i
fancy
i
looked
on
him
last
sprawling
and
staring
and
writhing
in
the
roar
of
the
battle
blast
then
a
mad
crashed
over
and
scattered
his
brains
as
it
passed
oh
harley
and
fanning
and
barret
they
were
bloody
good
mates
o
mine
their
bodies
are
empty
bottles
death
has
guzzled
the
wine
what
left
of
them
filth
and
where
is
the
fire
divine
i
tell
at
night
in
the
trenches
as
i
watch
and
i
do
my
part
three
radiant
spirits
i
seeing
high
heart
revealing
to
heart
and
they
building
a
peerless
palace
to
the
splendor
and
triumph
of
art
yet
alas
for
the
fame
of
barret
the
glory
he
might
have
trailed
and
alas
for
the
name
of
fanning
a
star
that
beaconed
and
paled
poor
harley
obscure
and
well
who
shall
say
that
they
failed
no
each
did
a
something
grander
than
ever
he
dreamed
to
do
and
as
for
the
work
unfinished
all
will
be
paid
their
due
the
broken
ends
will
be
fitted
the
balance
struck
will
be
true
so
painters
and
players
and
penmen
i
tell
you
do
as
you
please
let
your
fame
outleap
on
the
trumpets
you
never
rise
up
to
these
to
three
grim
and
gory
tommies
down
down
on
your
bended
knees
daventry
the
sculptor
is
buried
in
a
little
graveyard
near
one
of
our
posts
just
now
our
section
of
the
line
is
quiet
so
i
often
go
and
sit
there
stretching
myself
on
a
flat
stone
i
dream
for
hours
silence
and
solitude
how
good
the
peace
of
it
all
seems
around
me
the
grasses
weave
a
pattern
and
half
hide
the
hundreds
of
little
wooden
crosses
here
is
one
with
a
single
name
aubrey
who
was
aubrey
i
wonder
then
another
our
beloved
then
one
which
has
attached
to
it
in
the
cheapest
of
little
frames
the
crude
daub
of
a
child
three
purple
flowers
standing
in
a
yellow
vase
below
it
painfully
printed
i
read
my
darling
papa
thy
little
and
beyond
the
crosses
many
fresh
graves
have
been
dug
with
hungry
open
mouths
they
wait
even
now
i
can
hear
the
guns
that
are
going
to
feed
them
soon
there
will
be
more
crosses
and
more
and
more
then
they
will
cease
and
wives
and
mothers
will
come
here
to
weep
ah
peace
so
precious
must
be
bought
with
blood
and
tears
let
us
honor
and
bless
the
men
who
pay
and
envy
them
the
manner
of
their
dying
for
not
all

jeweled
orders

near
albert
february
over
the
spine
of
the
ridge
a
horned
moon
of
reddish
hue
peers
through
the
splintered
trees
where
the
trenches
are
rockets
are
rising
green
and
red
i
hear
the
coughing
of
the
maxims
the
peevish
nagging
of
the
rifles
the
boom
of
a
heavy
and
the
hollow
sound
of
its
exploding
shell
running
the
car
into
the
shadow
of
a
ruined
house
i
try
to
sleep
but
a
battery
starts
to
blaze
away
close
by
and
the
flame
lights
up
my
shelter
near
me
some
soldiers
are
in
deep
slumber
one
stirs
in
his
sleep
as
a
big
rat
runs
over
him
and
i
know
by
experience
that
when
one
is
sleeping
a
rat
feels
as
heavy
as
a
sheep
but
how
one
possibly
sleep
out
there
in
the
dark
there
is
the
wild
tattoo
of
a
thousand
rifles
and
hark
that
dull
roar
is
the
explosion
of
a
mine
there
the
purring
of
the
rapid
firers
desperate
things
are
doing
there
will
be
lots
of
work
for
me
before
this
night
is
over
what
a
cursed
place
as
i
can
not
sleep
i
think
of
a
story
i
heard
it
is
of
a
canadian
colonel
and
in
my
mind
i
shape
it
like
this
his
boys
i
going
billy
old
fellow
hist
lad
do
make
any
noise
there
boches
to
beat
all
creation
the
pitch
of
a

fixed
the
note
to
your
collar
you
got
to
get
back
to
my
boys
you
got
to
get
back
to
warn
before
it
the
break
of
day
the
order
came
to
go
forward
to
a
traced
on
the
map
i
knew
the
had
blundered
i
knew
and
i
told
so
i
knew
if
i
did
as
they
ordered
i
would
tumble
into
a
trap
and
i
tried
to
explain
but
the
answer
came
like
a
pistol
go
then
i
thought
of
the
boys
i
commanded
i
always
called
them
my
boys
the
men
of
my
own
recruiting
the
lads
of
my
countryside
tested
in
many
a
battle
i
knew
their
sorrows
and
joys
and
i
loved
them
all
like
a
father
with
more
than
a
father
pride
to
march
my
boys
to
a
shambles
as
soon
as
the
dawn
of
day
to
see
them
helplessly
slaughtered
if
all
that
i
guessed
was
true
my
boys
that
trusted
me
blindly
i
thought
and
i
tried
to
pray
and
then
i
arose
and
i
muttered
it
either
them
or
it
you
i
rose
and
i
donned
my
i
buckled
my
helmet
tight
i
remember
you
watched
me
billy
as
i
took
my
cane
in
my
hand
i
vaulted
over
the
sandbags
into
the
pitchy
night
into
the
pitted
valley
that
served
us
as
no
man
land
i
strode
out
over
the
hollow
of
hate
and
havoc
and
death
from
the
heights
the
guns
were
angry
with
a
vengeful
snarling
of
steel
and
once
in
a
moment
of
stillness
i
heard
hard
panting
breath
and
i
turned
it
was
you
old
rascal
following
hard
on
my
heel
i
fancy
i
cursed
you
billy
but
not
so
much
as
i
ought
and
so
we
went
forward
together
till
we
came
to
the
valley
rim
and
then
a
sputtered
it
was
even
worse
than
i
thought
for
the
trench
they
told
me
to
move
in
was
packed
with
boche
to
the
brim
they
saw
me
too
and
they
got
me
they
peppered
me
till
i
fell
and
there
i
scribbled
my
message
with
my
ebbing
away
now
billy
you
fat
old
duffer
you
got
to
get
back
like
hell
and
get
them
to
cancel
that
order
before
it
the
dawn
of
day
billy
old
boy
i
love
you
i
kiss
your
shiny
black
nose
now
home
hurry
you
devil
or
i
cut
you
to
see
poor
brute
he
off
and
i
i
go
as
a
soldier
goes
i
happy
my
boys
god
bless
it
had
to
be
them
or
me
ah
i
never
was
intended
for
a
job
like
this
i
realize
it
more
and
more
every
day
but
i
will
stick
it
out
till
i
break
down
to
be
nervous
terribly
sensitive
to
suffering
is
a
poor
equipment
for
the
man
who
starts
out
to
drive
wounded
on
the
battlefield
i
am
haunted
by
the
thought
that
my
car
may
break
down
when
i
have
a
load
of
wounded
once
indeed
it
did
and
a
man
died
while
i
waited
for
help
now
i
never
look
at
what
is
given
me
it
might
unnerve
me
i
have
been
at
it
for
over
six
months
without
a
rest
when
an
attack
has
been
going
on
i
have
worked
day
and
night
until
as
i
drove
i
wanted
to
fall
asleep
at
the
wheel
the
winter
has
been
trying
there
is
rain
one
day
frost
the
next
mud
up
to
the
axles
one
sleeps
in
lousy
barns
or
dripping
dugouts
cold
hunger
dirt
i
know
them
all
singly
and
together
my
only
consolation
is
that
the
war
must
soon
be
over
and
that
i
will
have
helped
when
i
have
time
and
am
not
too
tired
i
comfort
myself
with
scribbling
the
i
crawlin
out
in
the
mangolds
to
bury
wot
left
o
joe
joe

pal

ah
joe
we
be
pushin
up
dysies
together
old
chummie
i
heard
that
macbean
had
been
killed
in
belgium
i
believe
he
turned
out
a
wonderful
soldier
saxon
dane
too
has
been
missing
for
two
months
we
know
what
that
means
it
is
odd
how
one
gets
callous
to
death
a
mediaeval
callousness
when
we
hear
that
the
best
of
our
friends
have
gone
west
we
have
a
moment
of
the
keenest
regret
but
how
soon
again
we
find
the
heart
to
laugh
the
saddest
part
of
loss
i
think
is
that
one
so
soon
gets
over
it
is
it
that
we
fail
to
realize
it
all
is
it
that
it
seems
a
strange
and
hideous
dream
from
which
we
will
awake
and
rub
our
eyes
oh
how
bitter
i
feel
as
the
days
go
by
it
is
creeping
more
and
more
into
my
verse
read
this
bonehead
bill
i
wonder
and
wot
was
that
i
got
so
slick
i
could
see
face
because
the
night
was
thick
i
just
made
out
among
the
black
a
blinkin
wedge
o
white
then
i
guess
i
got
the
man
i
killed
last
night
i
wonder
if
account
o
me
some
wench
will
go
unwed
and
o
lives
will
never
be
because
stark
and
dead
or
if
missis
damns
the
war
and
by
some
candle
light
kids
are
prayin
for
the
fritz
i
copped
last
night
i
wonder
i
wonder
why
i
that
dream
i
saw
up
in
the
giddy
sky
the
gates
o
god
agleam
i
saw
the
gates
o
shine
wiv
everlastin
light
and
then
i
knew
that
i
got
mine
as
got
last
night
aye
bang
beyond
the
broodin
mists
where
spawn
the
mother
stars
i
wiv
me
bloody
fists
upon
them
golden
bars
i
till
a
devil
doubt
fair
froze
me
wiv
affright
to
fink
wot
god
would
say
about
the
bloke
i
corpsed
last
night
i
i
wilted
wiv
despair
when
like
a
rosy
flame
i
sees
a
angel
standin
there
calls
me
by
me
name
such
soft
such
shiny
eyes
and
smiled
and
through
the
gates
o
paradise
led
me
like
a
child
led
me
by
them
golden
palms
wot
that
jeweled
street
and
seraphs
was
psalms
you
no
ideer
sweet
wiv
cheroobs
crowdin
closer
round
than
peas
is
in
a
pod
led
me
to
a
shiny
mound
where
beams
the
throne
o
god
and
then
i
god
werry
voice
bill
no
fear
stand
up
and
glory
and
rejoice
for
led
you
and
in
a
nip
i
seemed
to
see
aye
like
a
flash
o
light
angel
pal
i
knew
to
be
the
chap
i
plugged
last
now
i
do
claim
to
understand
they
calls
me
bonehead
bill
they
shoves
a
rifle
in
me
and
show
me
to
kill
me
job
to
risk
me
life
and
limb
but
be
it
wrong
or
right
this
cross
i
makin
it
for
the
cove
i
croaked
last
night
iv
a
lapse
of
time
and
a
word
of
explanation
the
american
hospital
neuilly
january
four
years
have
passed
and
it
is
winter
again
much
has
happened
when
i
last
wrote
on
the
somme
in
i
was
sickening
with
typhoid
fever
all
that
spring
i
was
in
hospital
nevertheless
i
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
take
part
in
the
champagne
battle
in
the
fall
of
that
year
and
to
carry
on
during
the
following
winter
it
was
at
verdun
i
got
my
first
wound
in
the
spring
of
i
again
served
with
my
corps
but
on
the
entry
of
the
united
states
into
the
war
i
joined
the
army
of
my
country
in
the
argonne
i
had
my
left
arm
shot
away
as
far
as
time
and
health
permitted
i
kept
a
record
of
these
years
and
also
wrote
much
verse
all
this
however
has
disappeared
under
circumstances
into
which
there
is
no
need
to
enter
here
the
loss
was
a
cruel
one
almost
more
so
than
that
of
my
arm
for
i
have
neither
the
heart
nor
the
power
to
rewrite
this
material
and
now
in
default
of
something
better
i
have
bundled
together
this
manuscript
and
have
added
to
it
a
few
more
verses
written
in
hospitals
let
it
represent
me
if
i
can
find
a
publisher
for
it
if
not
i
will
print
it
at
my
own
cost
and
any
one
who
cares
for
a
copy
can
write
to
me

in
your

that
was
there
when

killed
mother
a
mother
son
like
me
it
seems
he
always
hauntin
me
he

maybe
he
was
bad

it
was
right
to
kill
the
inimy
you
hate
in
fair
and
honest
i
did
not
hate
at
all
mother
he
never
did
me
harm
i
think
he
was
a
lad
like
me
who
worked
upon

and
what
it
all
about
michael

say
of

if
whoever
wins
it
us
that
got
to
pay
oh
it
will
be
the
end
mother
when

the
ones
above
decide
that
we
be
and
when
will
that
day

folks
may
till
their
soil
and
live
and
love
in
peace
it
coming
soon
and
soon
mother
it
nearer
every
day
when
only
men
who
work
and
sweat
will
have
a
word
to
say
when
all
who
earn
their
honest
bread
in
every
land
and
soil
will
claim
the
brotherhood
of
man
the
comradeship
of
toil
when
we
the
workers
all
demand
are
we
fighting
for
then
then
we

stupid
crime
that
devil

what
he
wrote
and
hark
the
chime
of
christmas
bells
and
where
is
he
and
how
the
house
is
dark
and
sad
and
annie
sobbing
on
my
knee
the
page
beside
the
with
cruel
type
was
overfilled
i
read
and
read
until
a
name
leapt
at
me
and
my
heart
was
stilled
my
eye
crept
up
the
column
up
unto
its
hateful
heading
and
there
was
annie
on
the
stair
and
will
he
not
be
long
she
said
her
eyes
were
bright
and
in
her
hair
she
twined
a
bit
of
riband
red
and
every
step
was
daddy
sure
till
tired
out
she
went
to
bed
and
there
alone
i
sat
so
still
with
staring
eyes
that
did
not
see
the
room
was
desolate
and
chill
and
desolate
the
heart
of
me
outside
i
heard
the
shrill
another
glorious
victory
a
ah
what
care
i
a
thousand
victories
are
vain
here
in
my
ruined
home
i
cry
from
out
my
black
despair
and
pain
i
rather
rather
damned
defeat
and
have
my
man
with
me
again
they
talk
to
us
of
pride
and
power
of
empire
vast
beyond
the
sea
as
here
beside
my
hearth
i
cower
what
mean
such
words
as
these
to
me
oh
will
they
lift
the
clouds
that
or
light
my
load
in
years
to
be
what
matters
it
to
us
poor
folk
who
win
or
lose
it
we
who
pay
oh
i
would
laugh
beneath
the
yoke
if
i
had
at
home

home

one
country

so
a
million
women
say
hush

tiny
star
of
purest
glow

name

beside
our
gleaming
just

our
rage
and
pain

it
again
i
scared
that

their
flags
and
their
fuss

surely
be
hatin
to
spoil
their
joy
with
the
sight
of
such
wrecks
as
us
let
slip
away
quietly
you
and
me
and
we
talk
of
our
chums
out
there
with
your
eyes
that

see
me
that
wheeled
in
a
was
it
you
hullo
young
jones
with
your
tie
so
gay
and
your
pen
behind
your
ear
will
you
mark
my
cheque
in
the
usual
way
for
i
overdrawn
i
fear
then
you
look
at
me
in
a
manner
bland
as
you
turn
your
ledger
leaves
and
you
hand
it
back
with
a
soft
white
hand
and
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
it
you
young
jones
was
it
you
i
saw
and
i
think
i
see
you
yet
with
a
live
bomb
gripped
in
your
grimy
paw
and
your
face
to
the
parapet
with
your
lips
asnarl
and
your
eyes
gone
mad
with
a
fury
that
thrilled
you
oh
i
look
at
you
now
and
i
think
my
lad
was
it
you
young
jones
was
it
you
hullo
young
smith
with
your
look
and
your
coat
of
dapper
fit
will
you
recommend
me
a
decent
book
with
nothing
of
war
in
it
then
you
smile
as
you
polish
a
and
your
eyes
serenely
roam
and
you
suavely
hand
me
a
thrilling
tale
by
a
man
who
stayed
at
home
was
it
you
young
smith
was
it
you
i
saw
in
the
battle
storm
and
stench
with
a
roar
of
rage
and
a
wound
leap
into
the
reeking
trench
as
you
stood
like
a
fiend
on
the
and
you
stabbed
and
hacked
and
oh
i
look
at
you
and
i
ask
myself
was
it
you
young
smith
was
it
you
hullo
old
brown
with
your
ruddy
cheek
and
your
tummy
rounded
swell
your
garden
looking
jolly
and
your
kiddies
well
then
you
beam
at
me
in
your
cheery
way
as
you
swing
your
and
you
mop
your
brow
and
you
blithely
say
about
golf
old
man
was
it
you
old
brown
was
it
you
i
saw
like
a
stick
to
your
gun
a
cursing
devil
of
fang
and
claw
when
the
rest
were
on
the
run
your
eyes
aflame
with
the
as
you
sit
in
the
family
pew
and
i
see
you
rising
to
pass
the
plate
i
ask
old
brown
was
it
you
was
it
me
and
you
was
it
you
and
me
is
that
grammar
or
is
it
not
who
groveled
in
filth
and
misery
who
gloried
and
groused
and
fought
which
is
the
wrong
and
which
is
the
right
which
is
the
false
and
the
true
the
man
of
peace
or
the
man
of
fight
which
is
the
me
and
the
you
v
les
grands
mutiles
saw
three
wounded
of
the
war
and
the
first
had
lost
his
eyes
and
the
second
went
on
wheels
and
had
no
legs
below
the
thighs
and
the
face
of
the
third
was
featureless
and
his
mouth
ran
cornerwise
so
i
made
a
rhyme
about
each
one
and
this
is
how
my
fancies
the
sightless
man
out
of
the
night
a
crash
a
roar
a
rampart
of
light
a
flame
that
leaped
like
a
lash
searing
forever
my
sight
out
of
the
night
a
flash
then
oh
forever
the
night
here
in
the
dark
i
sit
i
who
so
loved
the
sun
supple
and
strong
and
fit
in
the
dark
till
my
days
be
done
aye
that
the
hell
of
it
stalwart
and
marie
is
stanch
and
true
willing
to
be
my
wife
swears
she
has
eyes
for
two
aye
but
it
long
is
life
what
is
a
lad
to
do
with
his
heart
and
his
brain
at
strife
there
now
my
pipe
is
out
no
one
to
give
me
a
light
i
grope
and
i
grope
about
well
it
is
nearly
night
sleep
may
resolve
my
doubt
help
me
to
reason
sleeps
and
i
heard
them
whispering
there
by
the
bed
oh
but
the
ears
of
the
blind
are
quick
every
treacherous
word
they
said
was
a
stab
of
pain
and
my
heart
turned
sick
then
lip
met
lip
and
they
looked
at
me
sitting
bent
by
the
fallen
fire
and
they
laughed
to
think
that
i
could
see
but
i
felt
the
flame
of
their
hot
desire
he
helping
marie
to
work
the
farm
a
dashing
upstanding
chap
they
say
and
look
at
me
with
my
flabby
arm
and
the
fat
of
sloth
and
my
face
of
clay
look
at
me
as
i
sit
and
sit
by
the
side
of
a
fire
that
seldom
lit
sagging
and
weary
the
livelong
day
when
every
one
else
is
out
on
the
field
sowing
the
seed
for
a
golden
yield
or
tossing
around
the
oh
the
shimmering
wheat
that
frets
the
sky
gold
of
plenty
and
blue
of
hope
i
seeing
it
all
with
an
inner
eye
as
out
of
the
door
i
grope
and
grope
and
i
hear
my
wife
and
her
lover
there
whispering
whispering
round
the
rick
mocking
me
and
my
sightless
stare
as
i
fumble
and
stumble
everywhere
slapping
and
tapping
with
my
stick
old
and
weary
at
heartsick
wishing
it
all
was
done
oh
i
tap
my
way
around
to
the
byre
and
i
hear
the
cows
as
they
chew
their
hay
there
at
least
there
is
none
to
tire
there
at
least
i
am
not
in
the
way
and
they
look
at
me
with
their
velvet
eyes
and
i
stroke
their
flanks
with
my
woman
hand
and
they
answer
to
me
with
soft
replies
and
somehow
i
fancy
they
understand
and
the
horses
too
they
know
me
well
i
sure
that
they
pity
my
wretched
lot
and
the
big
fat
ram
with
the
jingling
bell
oh
the
beasts
are
the
only
friends
i
got
and
my
old
dog
too
he
loves
me
more
i
think
than
ever
he
did
before
thank
god
for
the
beasts
that
are
all
so
kind
that
know
and
pity
the
helpless
blind
ha
they
coming
the
loving
pair
my
hand
as
my
pipe
i
fill
what
if
i
steal
on
them
unaware
with
a
to
kill
to
kill
i
do
it
they
there
in
the
mow
of
hay
i
hear
them
saying
he
out
of
the
way
hark
how
they
kissing
and
closer
i
creep
i
crouch
i
ugh
what
a
horrible
dream
i
had
and
it
is
real
i
glad
i
glad
marie
is
good
and
marie
is
true
but
now
i
know
what
it
best
to
do
i
sell
the
farm
and
i
seek
my
kind
i
live
apart
with
my
and
we
eat
and
drink
and
we
laugh
and
joke
and
we
talk
of
our
battles
and
smoke
and
smoke
and
brushes
of
bristle
we
make
for
sale
while
one
of
us
reads
a
book
of
braille
and
there
will
be
music
and
dancing
too
and
we
seek
to
fashion
our
life
anew
and
we
walk
the
highways
hand
in
hand
the
brotherhood
of
the
sightless
band
till
the
years
at
last
shall
bring
respite
and
our
night
is
lost
in
the
greater
night
the
legless
man
dark
mind
goes
back
to
fumin
wood
and
how
we
stuck
it
out
eight
days
of
hunger
thirst
and
cold
mowed
down
by
steel
and
flame
in
mud
and
mad
with
woe
with
dead
men
all
about
we
fought
like
fiends
and
waited
for
relief
that
never
came
eight
days
and
nights
they
rolled
on
us
in
mass
debout
les
morts
we
hurled
them
back
by
god
they
did
not
they
pinned
two
medals
on
my
chest
a
yellow
and
a
brown
and
lovely
ladies
made
me
blush
such
pretty
words
they
said
i
felt
a
cheerful
man
almost
until
my
eyes
went
down
and
there
i
saw
the
blankets
how
they
sagged
upon
my
bed
and
then
again
i
drank
the
cup
of
sorrow
to
the
dregs
oh
they
can
keep
their
medals
if
they
give
me
back
my
legs
i
think
of
how
i
used
to
run
and
leap
and
kick
the
ball
and
ride
and
dance
and
climb
the
hills
and
frolic
in
the
sea
and
all
the
thousand
things
that
now
i
never
do
at
dieu
there
nothing
left
in
life
it
often
seems
to
me
and
as
the
nurses
lift
me
up
and
strap
me
in
my
chair
if
they
would
chloroform
me
off
i
feel
i
would
care
ah
yes
we
heroes
all
they
point
to
us
with
pride
their
hearts
go
out
to
us
the
tears
are
in
their
eyes
but
wait
a
bit
they
will
blindly
look
aside
no
more
they
talk
of
what
they
owe
the
dues
of
sacrifice
one
hates
to
be
reminded
of
an
everlasting
debt
it
all
in
human
nature
ah
the
world
will
soon
forget
mind
goes
back
to
where
i
lay
on
the
plain
and
ate
the
muddy
mangold
roots
and
drank
the
drops
of
dew
and
dragged
myself
for
miles
and
miles
when
every
move
was
pain
and
over
me
the
were
retching
as
they
flew
oh
ere
i
closed
my
eyes
and
stuck
my
rifle
in
the
air
i
wish
that
those
who
picked
me
up
had
passed
and
left
me
bright
oh
one
gets
used
to
everything
i
hum
a
merry
song
and
up
the
street
and
round
the
square
i
wheel
my
chair
along
for
look
you
how
my
chest
is
sound
and
how
my
arms
are
strong
oh
one
gets
used
to
anything
it
awkward
at
the
first
and
jolting
the
cobbles
gives
a
man
a
grievous
thirst
but
of
all
ills
that
one
must
bear
that
surely
not
the
worst
for
there
the
cafe
open
wide
and
there
they
set
me
up
and
there
i
smoke
my
above
my
cider
cup
and
play
a
while
before
i
hurry
home
to
sup
at
home
the
wife
is
waiting
me
with
smiles
and
and
little
claps
her
hands
with
laughter
loud
and
high
and
if
there
cause
to
growl
i
fail
to
see
the
reason
why
and
all
the
evening
by
the
lamp
i
read
some
tale
of
crime
or
play
my
old
accordion
with
marie
keeping
time
until
we
hear
the
hour
of
ten
from
out
the
steeple
chime
then
in
the
morning
bright
and
soon
no
moment
do
i
lose
within
my
little
cobbler
shop
to
gain
the
silver
good
luck
one
has
no
need
of
legs
to
make
a
pair
of
shoes
and
every
sunday
oh
it
then
i
am
the
happy
man
they
wheel
me
to
the
and
there
with
rod
and
can
i
sit
and
fish
and
catch
a
dish
of
for
the
pan
aye
one
gets
used
to
everything
and
does
seem
to
mind
maybe
i
happier
than
most
of
my
kind
for
look
you
at
the
darkest
cloud
lo
how
it
the
faceless
man
officially
i
dead
their
hope
is
past
how
long
i
stood
as
missing
now
at
last
i
dead
look
in
my
face
no
likeness
can
you
see
no
tiny
trace
of
him
they
knew
as
me
how
terrible
the
change
even
my
eyes
are
strange
so
keyed
are
they
to
pain
that
if
i
chanced
to
meet
my
mother
in
the
street
she
look
at
me
in
vain
when
she
got
home
i
think
she
say
i
saw
the
saddest
sight
a
with
no
face
at
all
far
better
in
the
fight
to
fall
than
go
through
life
like
that
i
think
poor
fellow
how
he
made
me
shrink
no
face
just
eyes
that
seemed
to
stare
at
me
with
anguish
and
despair
this
ghastly
war
i
almost
cheered
to
think
my
son
who
disappeared
my
boy
so
handsome
and
so
gay
might
have
come
home
like
him
i
dead
i
think
it
better
to
be
dead
when
little
children
look
at
you
with
dread
and
when
you
know
your
coming
home
again
will
only
give
the
ones
who
love
you
pain
ah
who
can
help
but
shrink
one
can
not
blame
they
see
the
hideous
husk
not
not
the
flame
of
sacrifice
and
love
that
burns
within
while
souls
of
satyrs
riddled
through
with
sin
have
bodies
fair
and
excellent
to
see
dieu
how
different
we
all
would
be
if
this
our
flesh
was
ordained
to
express
our
spirit
beauty
or
its
ugliness
oh
you
who
look
at
me
with
fear
and
shrink
despite
yourselves
and
turn
away
it
was
for
you
i
suffered
woe
accurst
for
you
i
braved
red
battle
at
its
worst
for
you
i
fought
and
bled
and
maimed
and
slew
for
you
for
you
for
you
i
faced
and
despair
the
reeking
horror
of
it
all
i
knew
i
flung
myself
into
the
furnace
there
i
faced
the
flame
that
scorched
me
with
its
glare
i
drank
unto
the
dregs
the
devil
brew
look
at
me
now
for
and
and
i
thinking
of
the
time
we
said
we
took
our
dinner
in
duval
that
night
just
little
jacqueline
lucette
and
i
we
tried
our
very
utmost
to
be
bright
we
laughed
and
yet
our
eyes
they
were
gay
i
sought
all
kinds
of
cheering
things
to
say
do
grieve
i
told
them
soon
the
time
will
pass
my
next
permission
will
come
quickly
round
we
all
meet
at
the
gare
du
montparnasse
three
times
i
come
already
safe
and
sound
but
oh
i
thought
it
harder
every
time
after
a
home
that
seems
like
paradise
to
go
back
to
the
vermin
and
the
slime
the
weariness
the
want
the
sacrifice
pray
god
i
said
the
war
may
soon
be
done
but
no
oh
never
never
till
we
won
then
to
the
station
quietly
we
walked
i
had
my
rifle
and
my
haversack
my
heavy
boots
my
blankets
on
my
back
and
though
it
hurt
us
cheerfully
we
talked
we
chatted
bravely
at
the
platform
gate
i
watched
the
clock
my
train
must
go
at
eight
one
minute
to
the
hour
we
kissed
then
oh
they
both
broke
down
with
piteous
cry
i
their
way
was
barred
they
could
not
pass
i
looked
back
as
the
train
began
to
start
once
more
i
ran
with
anguish
at
my
heart
and
through
the
bars
i
kissed
my
little
three
years
have
gone
they
waited
day
by
day
i
never
came
i
did
not
even
write
for
when
i
saw
my
face
was
such
a
sight
i
thought
that
i
had
better
stay
away
and
so
i
took
the
name
of
one
who
died
a
friendless
friend
who
perished
by
my
side
in
prussian
prison
camps
three
years
of
hell
i
kept
my
secret
oh
i
kept
it
well
and
now
i
free
but
none
shall
ever
know
they
think
i
died
out
there
it
better
so
i
passed
my
wife
in
widow
weeds
i
brushed
her
arm
she
did
not
even
look
so
white
so
pinched
her
face
my
heart
still
bleeds
and
at
the
touch
of
her
oh
how
i
shook
and
then
last
night
i
passed
the
window
where
they
sat
together
i
could
see
them
clear
the
lamplight
softly
gleaming
on
their
hair
and
all
the
room
so
full
of
cozy
cheer
my
wife
was
sewing
while
my
daughter
read
i
even
saw
my
portrait
on
the
wall
i
wanted
to
rush
in
to
tell
them
all
and
then
i
cursed
myself
you
dead
you
dead
god
how
i
watched
them
from
the
darkness
there
clutching
the
dripping
branches
of
a
tree
peering
as
close
as
ever
i
might
dare
and
sobbing
sobbing
oh
so
bitterly
but
no
it
folly
and
i
must
stay
i
am
going
far
away
i
find
a
ship
and
sail
before
the
mast
in
some
wild
land
i
bury
all
the
past
i
live
on
lonely
shores
and
there
forget
or
tell
myself
that
there
has
never
been
the
gay
and
tender
courage
of
lucette
the
little
loving
arms
of
jacqueline
a
man
lonely
upon
a
lonely
isle
sometimes
i
look
towards
the
north
and
smile
to
think
they
happy
and
they
both
believe
i
died
for
france
and
that
i
lie
at
rest
and
for
my
glory
sake
they
ceased
to
grieve
and
hold
my
memory
sacred
ah
that
best
and
in
that
thought
i
find
my
joy
and
peace
as
there
alone
i
wait
the
last
release
finished
up
the
filthy
war
we
won
what
we
were
fighting
for
or
have
we
i
do
know
but
anyway
i
have
my
wish
i
back
upon
the
old
boul
mich
and
how
my
heart
aglow
though
in
my
coat
an
empty
sleeve
ah
do
not
think
i
ever
grieve
the
pension
for
it
i
believe
will
keep
me
on
the
go
so
i
be
free
to
write
and
write
and
give
my
soul
to
sheer
delight
till
joy
is
almost
pain
to
stand
aloof
and
watch
the
throng
and
worship
youth
and
sing
my
song
of
faith
and
hope
again
to
seek
for
beauty
everywhere
to
make
each
day
a
living
prayer
that
life
may
not
be
vain
to
sing
of
things
that
comfort
me
the
joy
in
the
glee
of
little
ones
at
play
the
blessed
gentleness
of
trees
of
old
men
dreaming
at
their
ease
soft
afternoons
away
of
violets
and
swallows
wings
of
wondrous
ordinary
things
in
words
of
every
day
to
rhyme
of
rich
and
rainy
nights
when
like
a
legion
leap
the
lights
and
take
the
town
with
gold
of
taverns
quaint
where
poets
dream
of
cafes
gaudily
agleam
and
vice
that
overbold
of
crystal
shimmer
silver
sheen
of
soft
and
soothing
nicotine
of
wine
that
rich
and
old
of
gutters
and
stars
of
and
the
sordid
and
sublime
of
wealth
and
misery
that
meet
in
every
great
and
little
street
of
glory
and
of
grime
of
all
the
living
tide
that
flows
from
princes
down
to
puppet
shows
i
make
my
humble
rhyme
so
if
you
like
the
sort
of
thing
of
which
i
also
like
to
sing
just
give
my
stuff
a
look
and
if
you
do
no
harm
is
done
in
writing
it
i
had
my
fun
good
luck
to
you
and
every
one
and
so
here
ends
my
notes
while
poore
is
a
fictional
character
he
is
real
enough
in
some
ways
robert
service
was
himself
in
the
ambulance
corps
and
his
descriptions
of
of
this
day
and
the
emergence
of
war
bear
striking
similarities
to
the
case
of
alan
seeger
and
no
doubt
a
great
many
other
poets
of
the
great
war
it
has
been
said
that
every
section
of
the
trench
had
its
own
poet
and
many
of
them
such
as
wilfred
owen
siegfried
sassoon
and
robert
graves
became
famous
for
their
poetry
of
the
war
this
book
in
its
way
presents
a
striking
picture
of
the
effect
of
the
war
on
europe
though
it
stops
short
of
showing
just
how
great
the
effect
was
i
hope
you
enjoyed
service
references
to
himself
in
the
text
as
sourdough
service
but
they
should
not
be
taken
too
seriously
the
names
of
two
great
russian
composers
tchaikovsky
and
stravinsky
were
originally
spelled
tschaikowsky
and
stravinski
in
the
philistine
and
the
bohemian
these
composers
were
contemporaries
of
the
author
and
due
to
the
difficulty
of
transliterating
from
the
russian
cyrillic
alphabet
to
the
roman
alphabet
hampered
by
different
uses
of
roman
letters
in
various
european
languages
it
is
not
until
fairly
recently
that
the
current
spellings
have
taken
hold
and
their
grip
is
not
yet
firm
a
couple
of
other
names
were
given
incorrectly
in
the
same
poem
mallarmé
was
spelled
with
one
l
and
a
painter
and
associate
of
rossetti
was
given
as
jones
these
names
are
corrected
in
this
text
as
is
synge
given
as
singe
in
the
original
the
introduction
to
alan
seeger
poems
written
by
william
archer
is
included
in
the
project
gutenberg
edition
of
seeger
poems
if
you
feel
inclined
to
compare
and
contrast
the
cases
if
you
enjoy
service
style
of
poetry
i
would
like
to
recommend
to
you
the
works
of
a
b
paterson
an
australian
poet
author
of
man

snowy

and

his

similar
