proem
winds
that
sigh
and
sing
led
me
wrapped
in
many
moods
thro
the
green
sonorous
woods
of
belated
spring
till
i
came
where
glad
with
heat
waste
and
wild
the
fields
were
strewn
olden
as
the
olden
moon
at
my
weary
feet
wild
and
white
with
starry
bloom
one
far
that
dashed
when
some
mad
wind
it
flashed
into
billowy
foam
i
bewildered
gazed
around
as
one
on
whose
heavy
dreams
comes
a
sudden
burst
of
beams
like
a
mighty
sound
if
the
grander
flowers
i
sought
but
these
to
you
evanescent
as
their
dew
only
these
i
brought
july
by
wold
and
wood
the
hollow
i
fleet
swallows
soared
and
darted
empty
vaults
of
blue
thick
leaves
close
clung
or
parted
to
let
the
sunlight
through
each
wild
rose
bowed
full
of
living
dew
ii
down
deep
fair
fields
of
heaven
beat
wafts
of
air
and
balm
from
southmost
islands
driven
and
continents
of
calm
bland
winds
by
which
were
given
hid
hints
of
rustling
palm
iii
high
birds
soared
high
to
hover
thick
leaves
close
clung
to
slip
wild
rose
and
snowy
clover
were
warm
for
winds
to
dip
and
one
ungentle
lover
a
bee
with
robber
lip
iv
dart
on
o
buoyant
swallow
kiss
leaves
and
willing
rose
whose
musk
the
sly
winds
follow
and
bee
that
booming
goes
but
in
this
quiet
hollow
i
walk
which
no
one
knows
none
save
the
moon
that
shineth
at
night
through
rifted
trees
the
lonely
flower
that
twineth
frail
blooms
that
no
one
sees
the
whippoorwill
that
pineth
the
sad
breeze
vi
the
lone
white
stars
that
glitter
the
stream
complaining
wave
gray
bats
that
dodge
and
flitter
black
crickets
hid
that
rave
and
me
whose
life
is
bitter
and
one
white
head
stone
grave
by
wold
and
wood
i
green
watery
jets
of
light
let
through
the
rippling
foliage
drenched
with
dew
bland
glamours
warm
and
dim
above
the
mystic
vistas
swim
where
the
fountain
oozy
urn
the
limp
loose
fronds
of
limber
fern
wave
dusky
tresses
thin
and
wet
with
violet
roots
that
writhe
in
snaky
knots
the
moss
in
amber
cushions
clots
from
wattled
walls
of
brier
and
brush
the
elder
misty
attars
gush
and
by
knoll
and
bank
the
affluent
wild
rose
flowers
rank
and
in
shadowy
retreats
in
black
rich
soil
your
vision
greets
the
colder
undergrowths
of
woods
damp
whose
gloomier
moods
turn
all
the
life
beneath
to
death
and
rottenness
for
their
own
breath
and
large
with
their
breadths
of
targe
wake
robins
leaved
their
stems
tipped
with
green
oval
clumps
of
gems
as
if
some
woodland
bacchus
there
of
his
yellow
hair
with
had
idly
tost
his
thyrsus
there
and
so
had
lost
low
blood
root
with
its
pallid
bloom
the
red
life
of
its
mother
womb
through
all
its
ardent
pulses
fine
beating
in
scarlet
veins
of
wine
and
where
the
knotty
eyes
of
trees
stare
wide
like
fauns
at
dryades
that
lave
smooth
limbs
in
founts
of
spar
shines
many
a
tender
star
ii
the
scummy
pond
sleeps
lazily
clad
thick
with
lilies
and
the
bee
reels
boisterous
as
a
bassarid
above
the
bloated
green
frog
hid
in
lush
wan
calamus
and
grass
beside
the
water
stagnant
glass
the
piebald
like
one
of
the
world
and
sun
comes
blindly
blundering
along
a
pedagogue
gaunt
lean
and
long
naturalist
with
wise
great
glaring
goggles
on
his
eyes
and
dry
and
hot
the
fragrant
mint
pours
grateful
odors
without
stint
from
cool
clay
banks
of
cressy
streams
rare
as
the
musks
of
rich
hareems
and
hot
as
some
sultana
breath
with
turbulent
passions
or
with
death
a
haze
of
floating
saffron
sound
of
shy
crisp
creepings
the
ground
the
dip
and
stir
of
twig
and
leaf
tempestuous
gusts
of
spices
brief
from
elder
bosks
and
sassafras
that
dodge
the
laughing
grass
sharp
sudden
songs
and
whisperings
that
hint
at
untold
hidden
things
pan
and
sylvanus
that
of
old
kept
sacred
each
wild
wood
and
wold
a
wily
light
beneath
the
trees
quivers
and
dusks
with
breeze
mayhap
some
hamadryad
who
culling
her
morning
meal
of
dew
from
frail
accustomed
cups
of
flowers
some
satyr
watching
through
the
bowers
had
when
his
goat
hoof
snapped
and
pressed
a
brittle
branch
shrunk
back
distressed
startled
her
wild
tumultuous
hair
bathing
her
limbs
one
instant
there
anticipation
windy
the
sky
and
mad
surly
the
gray
march
day
bleak
the
forests
and
sad
sad
for
the
beautiful
may
on
maples
tasseled
with
red
no
blithe
bird
swinging
sung
the
brook
in
its
lonely
bed
complained
in
an
unknown
tongue
we
walked
in
the
wasted
wood
her
face
as
the
spring
was
fair
her
blood
was
the
spring
own
blood
the
spring
her
radiant
hair
and
we
found
in
the
windy
wild
one
cowering
violet
like
a
frail
and
tremulous
child
in
the
caked
leaves
bowed
and
wet
and
i
sighed
at
the
sight
with
pain
for
the
may
warm
face
in
the
wood
may
passions
of
sun
and
rain
may
raiment
of
bloom
and
of
bud
but
she
said
when
she
saw
me
sad
tho
the
world
be
gloomy
as
fate
and
we
yearn
for
the
days
to
be
glad
dear
heart
we
can
afford
to
wait
for
know
one
beautiful
thing
on
the
dark
day
bosom
curled
makes
the
wild
day
glad
to
sing
content
to
smile
at
the
world
for
the
sinless
world
is
fair
and
man
is
the
sin
and
gloom
and
dead
are
the
days
that
were
but
what
are
the
days
to
come
be
happy
dear
heart
and
wait
for
the
past
is
a
memory
tho
seem
somber
as
fate
who
knows
what
will
be
and
the
may
came
on
in
her
charms
with
a
twinkle
of
rustling
feet
blooms
stormed
from
her
luminous
arms
and
honey
of
smiles
that
were
sweet
now
i
think
of
her
words
that
day
this
day
that
i
longed
so
to
see
that
finds
her
dead
with
the
may
and
the
march
but
a
memory
a
lament
i
white
moons
may
come
white
moons
may
go
she
sleeps
where
wild
wood
blossoms
blow
nor
knows
she
of
the
rosy
june
flowers
her
strewn
the
pearly
paleness
of
the
moon
alas
how
should
she
know
ii
the
downy
moth
at
evening
comes
to
suck
thin
honey
from
wet
blooms
long
lazy
clouds
that
swimming
high
brood
white
about
the
western
sky
grow
red
as
molten
iron
and
lie
above
the
fragrant
glooms
iii
rare
odors
of
the
weed
and
fern
dry
of
dim
leaves
that
turn
a
sound
of
hidden
waters
lone
frothed
bubbling
down
the
streaming
stone
and
now
a
plaintive
moan
drift
from
the
bushy
burne
iv
her
garden
where
deep
lilacs
blew
where
on
old
walls
old
roses
grew
with
their
mellow
musk
where
when
the
beetle
drone
was
husk
she
lingered
in
the
dying
dusk
no
more
shall
know
that
knew
when
orchards
courting
the
wan
spring
starred
robes
of
buds
around
them
fling
their
beauty
now
to
her
is
naught
once
a
sweet
passion
when
she
fraught
dark
curls
with
blooms
that
nodding
caught
impulse
from
the
bee
wing
vi
white
moons
may
come
white
moons
may
go
she
sleeps
where
wildwood
blossoms
blow
cares
naught
for
fairy
fern
or
weed
white
of
the
plumy
seed
of
hart
or
hind
she
takes
no
heed
alas
her
head
lies
low
distance
i
dreamed
last
night
once
more
i
stood
in
purple
clover
leas
your
old
home
glimmered
thro
its
wood
of
dark
and
melancholy
trees
where
sudden
summer
breeze
that
wantoned
the
solitude
the
water
melody
pursued
and
sleepy
hummings
of
the
bees
ii
and
in
violet
blooms
methought
i
saw
you
standing
there
a
lawny
light
among
the
glooms
a
crown
of
sunlight
on
your
hair
wild
songsters
singing
every
where
made
lightning
with
their
glossy
plumes
about
you
clung
the
wild
perfumes
and
swooned
along
the
shining
air
iii
and
then
you
called
me
and
my
ears
grew
flattered
with
the
music
led
in
fancy
back
to
sweeter
years
far
sweeter
years
that
now
are
dead
and
at
your
summons
fast
i
sped
buoyant
as
one
a
goal
who
nears
ah
lost
dead
love
i
woke
in
tears
for
as
i
neared
you
farther
fled
aspiration
god
knows
i
strive
against
low
lust
and
vice
wound
in
the
net
of
their
voluptuous
hair
god
knows
that
all
their
kisses
are
as
ice
to
me
who
do
not
care
god
knows
against
the
front
of
fate
i
set
eyes
still
and
stern
and
lips
as
bitter
prest
raised
clenched
and
ineffectual
palms
to
let
her
pressing
breast
god
knows
what
motive
such
large
zeal
inspires
god
knows
the
star
for
which
i
climb
and
crave
god
knows
and
only
god
the
eating
fires
that
in
my
bosom
rave
i
will
not
fall
i
will
not
thou
dost
lie
deep
hell
that
seethest
in
thy
simmering
pit
thy
thousand
throned
horrors
shall
not
vie
or
ever
compass
it
but
as
thou
sinkest
from
my
soul
away
so
shall
i
rise
rolled
in
the
morning
rose
beyond
this
world
this
life
this
little
day
god
knows
god
knows
god
knows
spring
twilight
the
sun
set
late
and
left
along
the
west
one
furious
ruby
rare
whose
rosy
rays
poured
in
a
cloud
breast
blossomed
to
peachy
sprays
the
sun
set
late
and
wafts
of
wind
arose
and
cuffed
the
blossom
from
the
blossoming
quince
shatter
red
attar
vials
of
the
rose
and
made
the
clover
wince
by
dusking
forests
thro
whose
fretful
boughs
in
flying
fragments
shot
the
evening
flame
adown
the
tangled
lane
the
quiet
cows
with
dreary
tinklings
came
the
sun
set
late
but
hardly
had
he
gone
when
the
moon
crescent
there
clean
phosphor
polished
as
a
precious
stone
pulsed
in
fair
deeps
of
air
as
from
faint
stars
the
glory
waned
and
waned
the
fussy
insects
made
the
garden
shrill
beyond
the
luminous
pasture
lands
complained
one
lonely
whippoorwill
fragments
i
stars
the
fields
of
space
gleam
bright
as
if
some
ancient
giant
old
as
the
moon
and
her
extinguished
mountains
had
dipped
his
fingers
huge
into
the
twilight
sea
of
gold
and
sprinkled
all
the
heavens
from
these
fountains
ii
ghosts
in
soft
sad
nights
when
all
the
still
lagoon
lolls
in
a
wealth
of
golden
radiance
i
sit
like
one
enchanted
in
a
trance
and
see
them
the
haunted
mist
and
moon
lascivious
eyes
sensual
brows
flashing
hot
killing
lust
and
tresses
light
lose
satin
streaming
purple
as
the
night
night
when
the
storm
sings
and
the
forest
bows
and
then
meseems
along
the
wild
fierce
hills
a
whisper
and
a
rustle
of
fleet
feet
as
if
tempestuous
troops
of
m√¶nads
meet
to
drain
deep
bowls
and
shout
and
have
their
wills
and
once
i
see
large
lustrous
limbs
revealed
and
lawny
sonorous
trees
and
then
a
song
faint
as
of
fairy
seas
lulls
all
my
senses
till
my
eyes
are
sealed
iii
moonrise
at
sea
with
lips
that
were
hoarse
with
a
fury
of
foam
and
of
winds
that
are
strewn
of
storm
and
of
turbulent
hurry
the
ocean
roared
heralding
soon
a
birth
of
miraculous
glory
of
madness
affection
the
moon
and
soon
from
her
waist
with
a
slipping
and
shudder
and
clinging
of
light
with
a
and
pushing
and
ripping
of
the
bodice
of
night
with
a
silence
of
feet
and
a
dripping
the
goddess
came
virginal
white
and
the
air
was
alive
with
the
twinkle
and
tumult
of
feet
the
hurling
of
stars
and
the
sprinkle
of
loose
lawny
limbs
and
a
sweet
murmur
and
whisper
and
tinkle
of
moon
spirits
fleet
the
rain
we
stood
where
the
fields
were
tawny
where
the
redolent
woodland
was
warm
and
the
summer
above
us
now
lawny
was
alive
with
the
pulse
winds
of
storm
and
we
watched
weak
wheat
waves
lighten
and
wince
and
hiss
at
each
gust
and
the
turbulent
maples
whiten
and
the
lane
grow
gray
with
dust
white
flakes
from
the
blossoming
cherry
pink
snows
of
the
peaches
were
blown
and
blooms
of
the
berry
and
the
dogwood
flowers
were
strewn
and
the
luminous
hillocks
grew
sullied
and
shadowed
and
thrilled
with
alarm
when
the
body
of
the
blackness
was
gullied
with
the
rapid
keen
flame
of
the
storm
and
the
birds
to
dry
coverts
had
hurried
and
the
musical
rillet
ran
slow
and
the
buccaneer
bee
was
worried
and
the
red
lilies
swung
to
and
fro
till
the
of
the
showers
came
bright
with
slant
lances
of
rain
and
charged
the
bare
heads
of
the
flowers
and
trampled
the
grass
of
the
plain
and
the
armies
of
the
leaves
were
shattered
their
standards
drenched
heavy
and
lank
and
the
iron
weed
purple
was
spattered
and
the
lily
lay
broke
on
the
bank
but
high
in
the
storm
was
the
swallow
and
the
voice
of
the
fall
in
the
dingle
sang
hollow
to
the
flags
on
its
wall
but
the
storm
and
its
clouds
passed
over
and
left
but
one
cloud
in
the
west
wet
wafts
that
were
fragrant
with
clover
and
the
sun
low
sunken
to
rest
soft
spices
of
poppies
of
honey
unfilched
of
a
bee
and
balm
of
the
mead
and
the
coppice
and
musk
of
the
tree
then
the
cloud
in
the
west
was
riven
and
bubbled
and
bursten
with
gold
blown
out
through
deep
gorges
of
heaven
and
spilled
on
the
wood
and
the
wold
to
mck
shall
we
forget
how
in
our
day
the
sabine
fields
about
us
lay
in
amaranth
and
asphodel
and
bubbling
cold
bandusian
well
fair
pyrrhas
haunting
every
way
in
dells
of
forest
faun
and
fay
within
the
fountain
spray
how
drained
we
wines
too
rare
to
tell
shall
we
forget
the
fine
falernian
or
the
ray
of
fiery
c√¶cuban
while
gay
we
heard
bacchantes
shout
and
yell
filled
full
of
bacchus
and
so
fell
to
dreaming
of
some
lydia
shall
we
forget
ii
if
we
forget
in
after
years
my
comrade
all
the
hopes
and
fears
that
hovered
all
our
walks
around
when
on
that
mystic
ground
of
ghostly
legends
where
one
hears
by
bandit
towers
the
chase
that
nears
thro
cracking
woods
the
oaths
and
cheers
of
demon
huntsman
horn
and
hound
if
we
forget
lenora
lover
and
her
tears
fierce
wallenstein
satanic
sneers
of
the
red
devil
goethe
bound
why
then
forsooth
they
soon
are
found
in
burly
stoops
of
german
beers
if
we
forget
morning
and
night
from
the
triumph
of
music
fresh
from
bathing
in
orient
fountains
in
wells
of
rock
water
and
snow
comes
the
dawn
with
her
fingers
the
thyme
and
the
pines
of
yon
mountain
where
she
steps
young
blossoms
fresh
blow
and
sweet
as
the
in
fountains
and
soft
as
the
fall
of
the
dew
wet
as
the
hues
of
the
to
me
was
the
dawn
when
on
mountains
the
hyaline
blue
and
pure
thro
the
blue
her
spirit
in
dimples
comes
dancing
in
dimples
of
light
and
of
fire
planting
her
footprints
in
roses
on
the
floss
of
the
while
glancing
large
on
her
brow
is
her
tire
gemmed
with
the
fire
but
sweet
as
the
incense
from
altars
and
warm
as
the
light
on
a
cloud
sad
as
the
wail
of
bleak
woodlands
to
me
was
the
night
when
she
falters
in
the
sorrowful
folds
of
her
shroud
in
the
black
of
her
shroud
the
bier
of
her
lover
the
day
lying
faded
and
fair
in
the
chambers
of
air
when
disheveled
i
seen
her
uncover
her
raven
of
hair
all
hooped
with
the
gold
of
the
even
and
for
this
sad
burial
prepare
the
spirit
of
night
in
the
heaven
to
me
was
most
wondrously
fair
so
fair
that
i
wished
it
were
given
to
die
in
the
rays

die
wrapped
in

the

once
more
the

with
her
great
moon
poured
harvest
the
golden
fields
once
more
her
days
in
hot
bright
shields
she
bore
from
morn
to
drooping
noon
a
rhymer
sick
of
work
and
rhyme
disheartened
by
a
poor
success
i
sought
the
woods
to
loll
the
time
in
one
long
month
of
quietness
it
was
the
time
when
one
will
thrill
for
indolent
fields
serener
skies
for
nature
softening
subtleties
of
higher
cloud
and
gullied
rill
when
crumpled
poppies
strew
the
halls
of
all
the
east
where
mounts
the
dawn
and
in
the
eve
the
skyey
lawn
gold

heap
night
gray

the
silver
peace
of
distant
wolds
of

a
glimmering
dance
fresh
green
of

hills
old
woodlands
silent
with
romance
intenser
stars
a
lazier
moon
the
moonlit
torrent
on
the
peak
and
at

side
a
maiden
meek
and
lovely
as
the
balmy

the
stood
beside
the
road
the
highway
from
the
city
smoke
its
long
well
broke
the
clean

the

showed
the
where
his
rest
should
be
the
locusts
tall
with
shade
on
shade
the
trough
of
water
cool
beneath
from
heat
and
toil
a
sabbath
made
beyond
were
pastures
where
the
kine
would
browse
and
where
a
young
bull
roared
and
here
would
pass
a
peeping
hoard
of
duck
and
brood
in
waddling
line
a
week
flew
by
on
wings
of
ease
i
walked
along
a
rutty
lane
i
stopped
to
list
some
picker
strain
sung
in
a
patch
of
raspberries
upon
the
fence
lanky
rails
i
leaned
to
stare
into
great
eyes
glooming
beneath
a
bonnet
white
bowed
a
chin
of
dimpled
prize
phoebe
the
daughter
she
i
knew
her
by
a
slow
calm
smile
whose
source
seemed
distant
many
a
mile
brimming
her
eyes
profundity
elastic
as
a
filly
tread
her
modest
step
and
full
and
warm
the
graceful
contour
of
her
form
harmonious
swelled
from
foot
to
head
and
such
a
head
you
thought
that
there
the
languid
night
in
frowsy
bliss
had
curled
brown
rays
for
her
deep
hair
and
stained
them
with
the
starlight
kiss
a
face
as
beautiful
and
bright
as
crystal
fair
as
twilight
skies
lit
with
the
stars
of
hazel
eyes
and
lashed
with
black
of
dusky
night
she
stood
amid
the
briers
above
in
twisted
lengths

rolled
the
sunset
tangled
whorls
of
gold
blown
from
the
west
fires
a
shuddering
twilight
dashed
with
gold
down
smouldering

fierce

fell
and
bubbling
over

the

cisterns
to
well
with
the
dusk
crescent
of
his

a
huge
crane
cleaves
the
wealthy
west

up
the
east
a
silver
breast
of
chastity
the
full
moon
brings
for
her
i

a

glass
to
flash
her
beauty
from
the

that
wild
flowers
bloomed
along
the
sod

when
she
smiled
the
hushed
to
hark
her
song

all
enamored
from
his
wild
before
her
feet
flew
long
the
brook
droned
mystic
melodies
eddied
in
laughter
when
she
kissed
with
naked

its

of

the

the

had
its
imperial
oberon
who
seeking
his

hid
in

him

lowly
whistling

upon

in

a

with

he
crushed
rare

hills
waking
the
crocus
and
the
daffodils
the
cold
earth
she
breathed
a
tender
sigh
the
maples
sang
and
flung
their
banners
high
their
pennons
and
the
elm
bound
his
dark
brows
with
a
helm
beneath
the
musky
rot
of
autumn
leaves
under
the
forest
myriad
naked
eaves
life
woke
and
rose
in
gold
and
green
and
blue
robed
in
the
of
the
twinkling
dew
with
timid
tread
adown
the
barren
wood
spring
held
her
way
when
lo
before
her
stood
winter
wagging
his
white
head
stormy
his
brow
and
stormily
he
said
sole
lord
of
terror
and
the
fiend
of
storm
crowned
king
of
despots
my
envermeiled
arm
slew
these
vast
woodlands
crimsoning
all
their
bowers
thou
spirit
of
beauty
with
thy
bursting
flowers
swollen
with
pride
wouldst
thou
usurp
my
throne
long
planted
here
deep
in
the
waste
wild
moan
sworn
foe
of
beauty
with
a
band
of
ice
i
strangle
thee
tho
thou
be
welcomer
thrice
so
round
her
throat
a
band
of
blasting
frost
her
sainted
throat
of
snow
he
coiled
and
crossed
and
cast
her
on
the
dark
unfeeling
mold
her
tender
blossoms
blighted
in
the
fold
of
her
warm
bosoms
trembling
bowed
their
brows
in
holy
meekness
or
in
scattered
rows
huddled
about
her
white
and
silent
feet
or
on
pale
lips
laid
fond

kisses
sweet
and
died
lilacs
all
musky
for
the

violets

silent

divinely
fair
like

gems
in

lovely

the

so
innocent
sweet
and
pure
why
must
thou
perish
and
the
evil
still
endure
too
soon
must
pass
the

away
too
long
doth
terror
hold
anarchal
sway
alas

not

such
a

what
bud

ripest
in

silently
plucks
it
at
the
fittest
hour
a
november
sketch
the
hisses
the
feet
and
the
straggling
length
smote
by
the
morning
slanted
strength
sparkles
one
rib
of
virgin
sleet
to
withered
fields
the
crisp
breeze
talks
and
silently
and
sadly
lifts
the

leaves
from
the
beech
and
drifts
them
wadded
down
the
woodland
walks
reluctantly
and
one
by
one
the
worthless
leaves
sift
slowly
down
and
thro
the
mournful
vistas
blown
drop
rustling
and
their
rest
is
won
where
stands
the
brook
beneath
its
fall
with
ice
the
pool
is
bound
and
on
the
pebbles
scattered
the
ooze
is
frozen
one
and
all
white
as
rare
crystals
shining
fair
there
stirs
no
life
the
faded
wood
mourns
sighing
and
the
solitude
seems
shaken
with
a
mighty
care
decay
and
silence
sadly
drape
the
vigorous
limbs
of
oldest
trees
the
rotting
leaves
and
rocks
whose
knees
are
shagged
with
moss
with
misty
crape
to
sullenness
the
surly
crow
all
his
derisive
feeling
yields
and
the
barren
flaps
cawless
wrapped
in
hungry
woe
the
eve
comes
on
the
teasel
stoops
its
head
before
the
blast
the
tattered

drive
whirling
past
like
skeletons
in
whistling
troops
the
pithy
elder
copses
sigh
their
broad
blue
combs
with

weighed
like
heavy

swayed
with
gust
that
hurries
by
thro

as
she
passed
she
bent
and
kissed
each
modest
orb
that
selfless
hung
as
low

groped
her
train
of
jet
which
billowing
by
did
merely
waft
the
sound
of
a
brief
gust
to
each
wild
violet
to
kiss
each
eye

laugh

shed
a

all

the

turned
to
the
rose
beside
with
a
heavy
glance

but
sadly
sighed
and
the
orient
grew
to
a
wealth
of
bars
which
churned
and
the
princess
proud
saw
her
lord
of
stars
in
a
torrid
furnace
burned
and
the
giant
of
life
with
his
breath

glared
down

this

the

it

the

a
human
skull
in
a
lay
for
the

was
a
wreck
and
the
tombstones
old
on
the
graves
of
their
dead
were
rotting
away
to
the
like
of
their
mould
and
an
heremite
toad
in
this
desolate
seat
had
made
him
an
hermitage
long
agone
where
the
ivy
frail
with
its
delicate
feet
could
creep
his
cell
of
bone
and
the
ground
was
dark
and
the
springing
dawn
when
it
struck
from
the
tottering
stones
of
each
grave
a
glimmering
silver
the

drops
wan
this
skull
and
its
ivy
would
lave

her
crescent
had
thinly
hung
from
a
single
star
the
shattered
wall
and
its
feeble
light
on
the
stone
was
flung
where
i
sat
to
hear
him
call
and
i
heard
this
heremite
toad
as
he
sate
in
the
gloom
of
his
ghastly
hermitage
to
himself
and
the
gloom
all
hollowly
prate
like
a
misanthropic
sage
o
beauty
is
well
and
is
wealth
to
all
but
wealth
without
beauty
fair
and
beauty
with
wealth
brings
wooers
tall
whom
she
snares
in
her
golden
hair
tho
beauty
be
well
and
be
wealth
to
all
and
wealth
without
beauty
draw
men
beauty
must
come
to
the
vaulted
wall
and
what
is
wealth
to
her
then
this
skeleton
face
was
beautiful
erst
these
sockets
could
mammonites
sway
so
she
barter
her
beauty
for
gold
accurs
but
both
have
vanished
away
but
beauty
is
well
when
the
mind
it
reveals
more
beautiful
is
than
the
head
for
beauty
and
wealth
the
tomb
congeals
but
the
mind
grows
lovelier
dead
and
he
blinked
at
the
moon
from
his
grinning
cell
and
the
darnels
and
burdocks
around
bowed
down

of

the

by
the

five
rotten
gables
look
upon
wan
rotting
roses
and
rank
weeds
old
iron
gates
on
posts
of
stone
dim
dingles
where
the
vermin
breeds
five
rotten
gables
black
appear
above
bleak
yews
and
cedars
sad
and
thence
they
see
the
sleepy
mere
in
lazy
lilies
clad
at
morn
the
slender
a
burnished
ray
of
light
darts
past
the
knightly
bee
comes
charging
by
winding
a
surly
blast
at
noon
amid
the
fervid
leaves
the
quarreling
insects
gossip
hot
and
thro
the
grass
the
spider
weaves
a
weft
with
silver
shot
at
eve
the
hermit
cricket
rears
his
vesper
song
in
shrillful
shrieks
the
bat
a
voyage
steers
beneath
the
sunset
streaks
the
slimy
worm
gnaws
at
the
bud
the
katydid
talks
dreamily
the
sullen
owl
in
monkish
hood
chants
in
the
old
beech
tree
at
night
the
dew
comes
down
and
lies
as
white
as
autumn
frost
upon
the
green
upon
the
brown
you
deem
each
bush
a
ghost
the
crescent
moon
with
golden
prow
plows
thro
the
frothy
cloud
and
gone
a
large
blue
star
comes
out
to
glow
above
the
house
alone
the
oozy
lilies
lie
asleep
on
beds
of
leaves
the
starlight
through
the
trees
doth
peep
and
fairy
garments
weaves
and
in
the
mere
all
lily
fair
a
maiden
corpse
floats
evermore
naked
and
in
her
raven
hair
wrapped
and
and
when
the
clock
of
yon
old
town
peals
midnight
the
fenny
heath
in
haunted
chambers
up
and
down
marches
the
pomp
of
death
and
stiff
stiff
silks
make
rustlings
sweep
sable
satins
murmuringly
and
then
a
voice
so
sweetly
sings
an
olden
melody
and
creatures
flit
and
dance
along
the
dusty
galleries
with
long
loose
locks
that
strangely
glance
and
eyes
but
in
one
chamber
when
the
moon
casts
her
cold
silver
wreath
on
wreath
holds
there
proud
state
on
ghastly
throne
the
skeleton
death
substratum
hear
you
r
o
music
in
the
creaks
made
by
the
sallow
grasshopper
who
in
the
hot
weeds
sharply
breaks
the
mellow
dryness
with
his
cheer
or
did
you
by
the
hearthstones
hear
the
cricket
kind
shrill
strain
when
frost
worked
mysteries
of
silver
near
upon
the
casement
panes
and
lost
without
the
seemed
a
sheeted
ghost
or
through
the
dank
dim
springtide
night
green
minstrels
of
the
marshlands
tune
their
hoarse
lyres
in
the
pale
twilight
hailing
the
sickle
of
the
moon
from
pools
that
glassed
her
lune
or
in
the
summer
dry
and
loud
the
hard
cicada
whirr
aboon
his
long
lay
in
a
poplar
cloud
when
the
thin
heat
rose
in
a
shroud
the
cloud
that
lids
the
naked
moon
and
smites
the
myriad
leaves
with
night
of
stormy
lashes
livid
strewn
with
veins
of
branched
and
splintered
light
the
fruitful
glebe
with
blossoms
white
the
thistle
purple
plume
the
tears
pearling
the
matin
buds
delight
contain
a
something
it
appears
their
real
selves
a
poetry
that
cheers
nor
scoff
at
those
who
on
the
wold
see
fairies
whirling
in
the
shine
of
prodigal
moons
whose
lavish
gold
paves
forests
wild
with
vine
when
all
the
wilderness
with
wine
of
tipsy
dew
is
dazed
nor
say
our
god
restricted
to
confine
his
wonders
solely
to
the
day
that
yields
the
abstract
tangible
to
clay
ponder
the
entrance
of
the
morn
when
from
her
rubric
forehead
far
shines
one
clean
star
and
the
dead
tarn
the
wooded
river
red
as
war
where
arid
splinters
of
the
scar
lock
horns
above
a
blue
abyss
how
roses
prank
each
icy
bar
while
piled
aloft
the
mountains
press
fling
dawn
below
from
many
a
hoary
tress
the
jutting
crags
all
with
iron
life
where
eaglets
scream
in
dizzy
flocks
and
cleave
the
stained
of
the
mountain
stream
thus
you
will
drink
the
thickest
cream
of
nature
if
you
do
not
scan
the
bald
external
and
must
deem
a
plan
existent
in
a
plan
as
life
in
thrifty
trees
or
soul
in
man
along
the
ohio
athwart
a
sky
of
brass
rich
ribs
of
gold
a
bullion
bulk
the
wide
ohio
lies
beneath
the
sunset
billowing
manifold
the
purple
rise
and
lo
the
crescent
of
a
crystal
moon
and
great
flushed
with
crimson
light
drifting
above
the
pureness
of
her
lune
rent
from
the
wings
of
night
a
crescent
boat
slips
the
burnished
stream
a
silver
wake
that
broadens
far
behind
follows
in
ripples
and
the
paddles
gleam
against
the
evening
wind
so
in
this
solitude
and
evening
hush
again
to
me
the
old
kentucky
glooms
behold
the
red
man
lurking
in
yon
bush
in
paint
and
eagle
plumes
and
now
the
breaking
of
the
brittle
brush
an
altered
forehead
hirsute
swells
in
view
and
now
comes
stealing
down
the
river
gush
the
dip
of
the
canoe
the
wigwams
glimmer
in
night
settling
waves
and
wildly
clad
around
the
glow
sit
chieftains
their
wily
braves
each
grasping
his
but
now
yon
boat
on
fading
waters
fades
the
clouds
have
lost
their
light
and
from
the
west
like
somber
sachem
shades
gallop
the
shades
of
night
the
broad
ohio
wavers
the
stars
and
many
murmurs
whisper
the
woods
tumultuous
mournings
of
dead
warriors
for
their
lost
solitudes
and
like
a
silver
curl
th
ohio
lies
among
the
earth
luxuriance
of
hair
majestic
as
she
met
the
red
man
eyes
as
beautiful
and
fair
no
marvel
that
the
warrior
love
waxed
flame
fighting
for
thee
kentucky
till
he
wound
inseparably
thee
that
old
name
of
dark
and
bloody
ground
but
peace
to
those
wild
braves
whose
bones
are
thine
and
peace
to
those
rude
pioneers
whose
moon
of
glory
rose
stars
of
lesser
shine
in
name
of
daniel
boone
peace
peace
the
lips
of
all
thy
forests
roar
the
rivers
mutter
peace
unto
thy
strand
thy
past
is
dead
and
let
us
name
thee
the
hospitable
land
the
ohio
falls
here
on
this
jutting
headland
where
the
trees
spread
a
dusk
carpet
for
the
sun
to
cast
and
count
his
golden
guineas
on
we
stay
for
hence
is
the
best
prospect
of
the
falls
whose
roar
no
more
astounds
the
startled
ear
as
when
we
bent
and
marked
it
from
the
bridge
seething
beneath
and
bounding
like
a
steed
a
tameless
steed
with
mane
of
flying
spray
between
the
pillars
rising
sheer
above
but
mark
how
soft
its
clamor
now
is
grown
incessant
rush
like
that
of
vernal
groves
when
like
some
sweet
surprise
a
wind
precursor
of
the
coming
rain
rides
down
from
a
gray
cloud
and
sets
their
leafy
tongues
of
the
fresh
impending
shower
there
runs
the
dam
and
where
its
dark
line
cuts
the
river
sheen
already
you
may
see
the
ripples
glancing
to
the
fervid
sun
as
if
the
waves
had
couched
a
hundred
spears
and
tossed
a
hundred
plumes
of
fleecy
foam
in
answer
to
the
challenge
of
the
falls
blown
on
his
bugle
from
the
battlements
of
his
subaqueous
city
rocky
walls
and
now
you
see
their
maddened
coursers
charge
hear
wavy
on
the
jagged
stones
that
pave
the
pathway
of
the
current
beat
while
billowing
they
ride
to
ringing
lists
with
shout
and
yell
and
toss
their
hundred
plumes
and
shock
their
riply
spears
in
tournament
upon
the
opposing
billows
shining
shields
now
sinks
a
pennon
but
is
raised
again
there
falls
or
breaks
a
spear
or
sparkling
sword
a
shattered
helmet
flies
in
flakes
of
foam
and
on
the
frightened
wind
hisses
away
and
it
all
you
hear
the
sound
the
roar
of
waves
that
fall
in
onset
or
that
strive
on
on
they
come
a
beautiful
mad
troop
on
on
along
the
sandy
banks
that
fling
red
arms
far
out
to
stay
the
riotous
waves
that
ride
and
hurl
along
in
casque
and
shield
and
wind
their
horns
and
there
where
thousand
oily
eddies
whirl
and
turn
and
turn
like
busy
wheels
of
steel
is
the
big
eddy
whose
deep
bottom
none
as
yet
have
felt
with
sounding
like
a
huge
giant
wily
in
its
strength
the
eddy
lies
and
bending
from
the
shore
the
spotted
sycamores
have
looked
and
looked
watching
his
motions
as
a
school
boy
might
a
sleeping
serpent
coiled
upon
his
path
so
long
they
watched
that
their
old
backs
have
grown
hump
gnarl
and
crooked
nor
seem
they
this
to
heed
but
gaze
and
gaze
and
from
the
glossy
waves
their
images
stare
back
their
wonderment
mayhap
they
seen
the
guardian
genius
lie
at
its
dark
bottom
in
an
oozy
cave
of
shattered
rock
recumbent
on
his
mace
of
mineral
his
locks
of
dripping
green
circling
a
crown
of
ore
his
fishy
eyes
dull
with
the
monotony
of
his
aqueous
realms
but
when
the
storm
abroad
and
smites
the
waves
with
stinging
lashes
of
the
myriad
rain
or
scars
with
thunder
some
ancestral
oak
sire
of
a
forest
then
he
wakes
in
wrath
and
on
the
dark
foundations
of
the
stream
stands
monarch
of
the
flood
in
iron
crown
and
murmurs
till
the
tempest
fiends
above
stand
stark
with
awe
and
all
the
eddy
breaks
to
waves
like
those
whose
round
and
murky
bulks
ribbed
white
with
foam
wallow
like
battened
swine
along
yon
ridge
of
ragged
rock
with
petrifactions
of
time
earliest
dawn
mollusks
and
trilobites
and
of
coral
white
and
here
and
there
a
mass
of
what
seems
writhing
reptiles
there
convolved
and
in
one
moment
when
the
change
did
come
which
made
and
unmade
continents
and
seas
that
teemed
and
groaned
with
dire
monstrosities
had
froze
their
glossy
spines
to
sable
stones
there
where
uprises
a
dun
knoll
with
black
and
rotten
stumps
in
the
mid
river
erst
rose
an
island
green
and
beautiful
with
willows
beeches
dappled
sycamores
corn
island
on
whose
rich
and
fertile
soil
the
early
pioneers
a
colony
attempted
once
to
found
ere
ever
this
fair
city
of
the
falls
now
echoing
to
the
tingling
bustle
of
its
busy
trade
was
dreamed
of
here
the
woodman
built
his
rude
log
cabin
here
he
sowed
his
maize
here
saw
it
tassel
the
summer
smile
and
glance
like
ranks
of
feathered
indians
the
misty
vistas
of
the
broken
woods
here
reaped
and
sheaved
its
wealth
of
ivory
ears
when
autumn
came
like
a
brown
indian
maid
tripping
from
the
pink
sunset
the
hills
that
blushed
for
love
and
cast
beneath
her
feet
untold
of
gold
in
leaves
and
yellow
fruit
here
lived
the
pioneer
and
here
he
died
and
mingled
his
rough
dust
with
the
raw
earth
of
that
long
isle
which
now
disparted
stands
and
nothing
save
a
bed
of
limestone
rock
where
in
the
quarry
you
may
see
the
blast
spout
heavenward
the
dust
and
dirt
and
stone
and
flap
and
pound
its
echoes
the
hills
like
giant
strokes
of
some
huge
airy
hammer
and
that
lone
mound
of
stumpy
earth
to
show
that
there
once
stood
an
isle
as
rich
and
fair
as
any
isle
that
rises
up
to
kiss
the
sun
and
dream
in
tropic
seas
of
balm
there
lies
the
other
half
of
what
was
once
corn
island
a
broad
channel
flows
between
and
this
low
half
mantled
with
a
dwarf
growth
of
what
was
once
high
brakes
and
forest
land
goose
island
now
is
named
in
the
dim
morn
ere
yet
the
east
assumes
her
faintest
blush
here
may
you
hear
the
melancholy
snipe
piping
or
see
her
paddling
in
the
pools
that
splash
the
low
bed
of
the
rocky
isle
once
here
the
indian
stole
in
natural
craft
from
brush
to
brush
his
head
plumes
like
a
bird
and
nodding
the
undergrowth
in
his
brown
hand
the
pliant
polished
bow
and
at
his
back
his
gaudy
quiver
filled
with
tufted
arrows
headed
with
blue
flint
and
while
the
deep
flamingo
colored
west
flamed
on
his
ruddy
cheek
its
airy
fire
strung
his
quick
bow
and
thro
the
gray
wild
goose
that
rose
with
clamor
from
the
rushy
pool
launched
a
fleet
barb
crested
with
quills
perchance
plucked
from
its
dead
mate
gray
wing
to
decorate
the
painted
shaft
that
should
dabble
their
white
in
its
mate
blood
it
falling
gasping
at
its
moccasined
feet
its
wild
life
breathed
away
while
the
glad
brave
whooped
to
the
sunset
and
yon
faint
blue
hills
answered
his
exultation
with
a
whoop
the
ruined
mill
there
is
the
ruined
with
its
rotten
wheel
that
stands
as
still
as
its
image
that
sleeps
in
the
glassy
pool
where
the
water
snake
coils
dim
and
cool
in
the
flaky
light
of
the
setting
sun
showering
his
gold
in
bullion
and
the
languid
daisies
nod
and
shine
by
the
trickling
fall
in
a
starry
line
the
drowsy
daisies
with
eyes
of
gold
large
as
the
eyes
of
a
queen
of
old
dreaming
of
revels
by
day
and
night
coyly
with
lashes
white
the
hawk
sails
high
in
the
sleepy
air
the
buzzard
on
wings
as
strong
and
fair
circles
and
stoops
the
lazy
cloud
and
crows
in
the
wood
are
cawing
aloud
will
ye
enter
with
me
this
ruined
mill
when
the
shades
of
night
its
chambers
fill
stand
and
lurk
in
the
heavy
dark
like
scowling
fiends
each
eye
a
spark
a
spark
of
moonlight
shot
thro
gloom
while
a
moist
rank
stifling
dead
perfume
of
rotting
timbers
and
rotting
grain
and
roofs
all
warped
with
the
sun
and
rain
makes
of
the
stagnant
air
a
cell
in
the
haunted
chambers
broods
like
a
spell
a
spell
that
makes
the
awed
mind
run
to
the
thoughts
of
a
hidden
skeleton
a
skeleton
ghastly
and
livid
and
lank
the
mossy
floors
in
a
cellar
dank
grinning
and
moisture
wet
in
its
hollow
eyes
a
mad
regret
or
with
me
enter
when
the
evening
star
in
the
saffron
heaven
is
sparkling
afar
in
all
its
glory
of
light
divine
like
a
diamond
bathed
in
kingly
wine
or
when
the
heavens
hang
wild
and
gray
and
the
chilly
clouds
are
hurrying
away
like
the
driven
leaves
of
an
autumn
day
when
the
sounds
on
the
sodden
roof
and
the
spider
lulls
in
his
dusty
woof
when
the
wet
wind
whines
like
a
hound
that
lashed
the
crazy
angles
strongly
dashed
or
wails
in
a
cranny
is
she
who
plays
on
her
airy
harp
sad
olden
lays
and
sings
and
moans
in
a
room
above
of
a
vague
despair
and
a
blighted
love
you
will
see
her
sit
on
the
shattered
sill
her
sable
tresses
dropped
loose
at
will
and
down
in
the
west
the
storm
black
bank
a
belt
of
wild
green
cold
livid
and
lank
and
a
crescent
moon
like
a
demon
barque
into
the
green
dips
a
horn
from
the
dark
while
a
lurid
light
of
ghoulish
gold
on
the
eldrich
creature
falls
strangely
cold
her
insane
eyes
bulge
mad
with
desire
and
her
face
beauty
is
darkly
dire
for
she
sees
in
the
pool
that
solidly
lies
the
mill
great
wheel
and
the
stormy
skies
her
murdered
lover
lie
faint
and
white
a
haunting
horror
a
loadstone
might
drawing
and
dragging
her
soul
from
its
seat
to
the
glimmering
ice
of
his
ghastly
feet
frost
white
artist
he
who
breezeless
nights
from
tingling
stars
jocosely
whirls
a
harlequin
in
spangled
tights
his
wand
a
pot
of
pounded
pearls
the
field
a
hasty
pallet
for
in
thin
or
thick
with
daub
and
streak
it
stretches
from
the
bar
to
the
bleached
ribbon
of
the
creek
a
great
geometer
is
he
for
on
the
creek
diaphanous
silk
sphere
cone
and
star
exquisitely
he
drawn
in
crystal
lines
of
milk

delicate
his

roofs

at

lies
by

where
the
low
lily
dies
with

eyes
they
gather
sweet
singing
in
voices
that
seem
faint
ringing

clinging
in
dreams
that
we
dream
in
visions
that
gleam
sweet
lisping
of

dry
rustle
of
hair
a
footfall
that
hisses
like
a

when

that
scatters
from

the
music
that
flatters
in

come
hither
in

night
ere
the
wither
and
the
harvester
white
morning
reaps
them
with

come
hither
where
singing
is
pleasant
as

dead
kisses
clinging
to
the
murdering
years
in

ears
come
hither
where

for

beams
ere
the
golden

wither
of
the
that

in

the

had
fallen
a

shower
the

yet
each

and

around
were
gleaming
wet
on
bosky
bower
a
million
gems
were
set
the

sifted
cool
with

mixed
with

from

its

along

scattered
warm
odors
from

curl
where
the

flattered
hung
molten

completer
with

aromas
sweet

sweeter
sweet

fair
more
fair
fleet

fleeter
thro
that
fair
sorceress
there
an
antique
mildewed
and
gray
the

rise
from
their
balustraded
urns
to
where
a
chiseled
satyr
glares
from
a
luxuriant
bed
of
ferns
a
pebbled
walk
that

parallels
of
verdant
box
to
where
on
grotesque
plinths
cushions
of

rises
a

of
shattered

broken

where
reveling
in
thick
carouse
the
buoyant
ivy
makes
its
home
and

from

there
from

down
the

jubilant

the
lavish
violet
odors
shed
in

of
a

and
where
in
lichened
hoariness
the
broken
marble
basks
in
the
summer
sultriness
rich
houri
roses
palpitate
voluptuous
languid
with
perfumes
as
were
the
beauties
that
of
old
in
damask
satins
jeweled
plumes
with
powdered
gallants
here
that
strolled
when
slender
rapiers
proud
with
gems
sneered
at
the
sun
their
haughty
hues
and
touchstone
wit
and
apothegms
laughed
down
the
long
cool
avenues
two
pleated
bowers
of
woodbine
pave
all
their
heaviness
of
musk
two
fountains
of
pellucid
wave
with
dusk
beholding
these
i
seem
to
feel
an
exodus
of
earthly
sight
an
influx
of
ecstatic
weal
poured
thro
my
eyes
in
jets
of
light
and
so
i
see
the
fountains
twain
of
hate
and
love
in
arden
there
the
time
of
regal
charlemagne
of
roland
and
of
oliver
rinaldo
of
montalban
towers
sleeps
by
the
spring
of
hate
above
bows
spilling
all
his
face
with
flowers
angelica
who
quaffed
of
love
a
guinevere
sullen
gold
down
all
the
sky
in
the
roses
sultry
musk
nightingales
hid
in
the
dusk
yonder
sob
and
sigh
you
are
here
and
i
could
weep
weep
for
joy
and
suffering
where
is
he
he
have
me
sing
there
he
sits
asleep
think
not
of
him
he
is
dead
for
the
moment
to
us
twain
he
were
dead
but
for
this
pain
drumming
in
my
head
am
i
happy
ask
the
fire
when
it
bursts
its
bounds
and
thrills
some
mad
hours
as
it
wills
if
those
hours
tire
he
had
gold
as
for
the
rest
well
you
know
how
they
were
set
saying
that
i
must
forget
and
was
for
the
best
i
forget
but
let
it
go
kiss
me
as
you
did
of
old
there
your
kisses
are
not
cold
can
you
love
me
so
knowing
what
i
am
to
him
sitting
in
his
gouty
chair
on
the
breezy
terrace
where
amber
swim
yes
your
cheek
a
wets
but
your
kisses
on
my
lip
fall
as
warm
as
bees
that
sip
sweets
from
violets
see
the
moon
has
risen
white
as
this
bursten
lily
here
rocking
on
the
dusky
mere
like
a
silent
light
let
us
walk
we
soon
must
part
all
too
soon
but
he
may
miss
give
me
but
another
kiss
it
will
heat
my
heart
and
the
bitter
winter
there
so
we
part
my
launcelot
my
true
knight
and
am
i
not
your
true
guinevere
oft
they
parted
thus
they
tell
in
that
mystical
romance
were
they
placed
think
you
perchance
for
such
love
in
hell
no
it
can
not
can
not
be
love
is
god
and
god
is
love
and
they
live
and
love
above
guinevere
and
he
i
must
go
now
see
there
fell
molten
into
purple
light
one
wild
star
kiss
me
and
once
more
farewell
clouds
all
through
the
tepid
summer
night
the
starless
sky
had
poured
a
cool
monotony
of
pleasant
rain
in
music
beautiful
and
for
an
hour
i
sat
to
watch
clouds
moving
on
majestic
feet
had
heard
down
avenues
of
night
their
hearts
of
thunder
beat
saw
ponderous
limbs
with
gold
pulse
fiery
life
wood
and
plain
while
scattered
fell
from
monstrous
palms
the
largess
of
the
rain
beholding
at
each
lightning
flash
the
generous
silver
on
the
sod
in
meek
devotion
bowed
i
thanked
these
almoners
of
god
no
more
i
the
slanted
storm
tossed
at
their
feet
the
autumn
leaves
the
park
high
pines
were
caked
with
sleet
and
armed
the
eaves
they
strolled
adown
the
pillared
pines
to
part
where
wet
and
twisted
vines
about
the
flapped
and
beat
she
watched
him
dimming
in
the
rain
along
the
river
misty
shore
and
laughed
with
lips
that
sneered
disdain
to
meet
no
more
ii
heavy
roses
weighed
with
dew
the
chirping
crickets
hid
down
the
honeysuckle
avenue
creaked
the
green
katydid
the
scattered
stars
smiled
thro
the
pines
thro
stately
windows
draped
with
vines
the
rising
moonlight
silver
blew
he
stared
at
lips
proud
white
and
dead
a
chiseled
calm
that
wore
despair
moaned
on
the
lips
that
said
to
meet
no
more
deserted
a
broken
rainbow
on
the
skies
of
may
touching
the
sodden
roses
and
low
clouds
and
in
wet
clouds
like
scattered
jewels
lost
upon
the
heaven
of
a
soul
the
ghost
of
a
great
love
perfect
in
its
pure
ray
touching
the
roses
moist
of
memory
to
die
within
the
present
grief
of
clouds
a
broken
rainbow
on
the
skies
of
may
a
flashing
amid
strange
flowers
or
red
or
white
its
darting
length
of
tongue
sucking
and
drinking
all
the
sweet
and
now
the
surfeit
and
the
hurried
fleet
a
love
that
put
into
expanding
bowers
of
one
large
heart
a
tongue
persuasive
powers
to
cream
with
joy
and
riffled
so
was
gone
a
flashing
amid
strange
flowers
a
foamy
moon
which
thro
a
night
of
fleece
moves
amber
girt
into
a
bulk
of
dark
and
lost
to
eye
rims
all
the
black
with
froth
a
love
of
smiles
that
tinctured
like
a
moth
moved
thro
a
soul
and
made
a
peace
more
bland
than
melancholy
white
to
cease
in
blanks
of
time
zoned
with
pale
memory
spark
a
foamy
moon
that
brinks
a
storm
with
fleece
a
blaze
of
living
thunder
not
a
leap
momental
spouting
balds
the
pil√©d
storm
the
ghastly
mountains
and
the
livid
ocean
the
crag
then
blots
the
sight
commotion
a
love
that
swiftly
pouring
bared
the
deep
which
cleaves
white
life
from
death
death
from
white
sleep
and
ceasing
gave
a
brain
one
blur
of
storm
blank
blast
of
midnight
love
for
death
and
sleep
the
dream
of
christ
i
saw
her
twins
of
eyelids
listless
swoon
mesmeric
eyes
like
the
mild
lapsing
of
a
lulling
tune
on
wide
surprise
while
slow
the
graceful
presence
of
a
moon
mellowed
the
purple
skies
and
had
she
dreamed
or
had
in
fancy
gone
as
one
who
sought
to
hail
the
influx
of
a
godly
dawn
of
heavenly
thought
trod
trembling
old
sainted
hill
and
lawn
with
intense
angels
fraught
sailed
thro
majestic
domes
of
the
deep
night
by
isles
of
stars
like
some
pure
blessing
warm
with
light
from
worldly
jars
to
the
high
halls
of
morning
pearly
white
and
heaped
with
golden
bars
past
temples
vast
deluged
with
sandy
seas
whose
ruins
stand
like
bleaching
bones
of
dead
monstrosities
crashed
to
the
land
stupendous
homes
of
cursed
idolatries
fallen
to
dust
and
sand
ugly
and
bestial
gods
caked
thick
with
gold
their
hideousness
blaspheming
christ
shattered
altars
rolled
to
rottenness
their
slaves
abolished
and
their
priests
of
old
trodden
to
nothingness
thro
syrian
plains
curtained
with
curling
mist
the
grass
she
trailed
where
the
shy
floweret
by
the
kissed
sweet
blushing
quailed
and
drowned
in
purple
vales
of
amethyst
the
bulbuls
wailed
on
glimmering
wolds
had
seemed
to
hear
the
bleat
of
folded
flocks
seen
sages
pass
with
sandaled
feet
and
hoary
locks
while
swimming
in
a
bath
of
molten
heat
a
great
star
glorious
rocks
in
fancy
a
beaming
baby
bent
cradled
amiss
in
a
rude
manger
on
its
brow
to
print
one
holy
kiss
while
down
the
slant
winds
faint
aromas
went
and
anthems
deep
of
bliss
and
then
she
woke
the
winter
moon
above
burst
on
her
sight
and
with
strange
sweetness
all
her
dream
was
wove
in
its
far
flight
for
jubilant
bells
rocked
booming
peace
and
love
down
all
the
aisles
of
night
to
autumn
i
oft
have
net
thee
autumn
wandering
beside
a
misty
stream
thy
locks
flung
wild
thy
cheeks
a
hectic
flush
more
fair
than
spring
as
if
on
thee
the
scarlet
copse
had
smiled
or
thee
i
seen
a
twisted
oak
beneath
thy
gentle
eyes
with
foolish
weeping
dim
beneath
a
faded
oak
from
whose
tinged
leaves
thou
woundedst
drowsy
wreaths
while
the
soft
breath
of
morn
did
kiss
thy
locks
and
make
them
swim
far
out
behind
brown
as
the
rustling
sheaves
oft
have
i
thee
upon
a
hillock
seen
all
agaze
at
glimpses
faint
of
glimmering
woods
that
glanced
the
hills
between
with
indian
faces
from
thy
airy
paint
or
i
have
met
thee
two
dappled
hills
within
a
dingled
valley
nigh
a
fall
clasped
in
thy
tinted
hand
a
ruddy
flower
and
lowly
stooping
where
the
rills
went
babbling
low
thro
wildwood
arrased
hall
where
burned
the
beech
and
maples
glared
their
power
oft
have
i
seen
thee
in
a
ruined
mill
where
basked
the
crimson
creeper
serpentine
where
fallen
leaves
did
stir
and
rustle
chill
and
saw
thee
rest
beneath
a
wild
while
echo
sad
amid
his
mountains
more
sad
than
erst
did
raise
a
dreamy
speech
and
call
thee
to
his
youthful
amorous
arms
where
splashed
the
murmuring
forest
limpid
fountains
and
tho
his
words
thy
ears
did
reach
thou
wouldst
not
heed
or
guile
him
with
thy
charms
once
saw
thee
in
a
hollow
girt
with
trees
amid
the
harvest
tawny
grain
thy
plushy
cheek
faint
flushing
in
the
breeze
in
thy
deep
eyes
a
drowsy
sky
blue
stain
and
where
within
the
woodland
twilight
path
the
skies
did
peep
all
speechless
down
and
stirred
the
gaudy
leaves
with
fragrant
breath
i
seen
thee
walk
nor
fear
the
winter
wrath
there
drop
asleep
clad
in
thy
gipsy
gown
while
echo
bending
dropp
tears
upon
thy
wreath
an
address
to
night
like
some
sad
spirit
from
an
unknown
shore
thou
comest
with
two
children
in
thine
arms
flushed
poppied
sleep
whom
mortals
aye
adore
her
flowing
raiment
sculptured
to
her
charms
soft
on
thy
bosom
in
pure
baby
rest
clasped
as
a
fair
white
rose
in
musky
nest
but
on
thy
other
like
a
thought
of
woe
her
brother
lean
cold
death
doth
thin
recline
to
thee
as
dear
as
she
thy
maid
divine
whose
frowsy
hair
his
hectic
breathings
blow
in
poppied
ringlets
billowing
all
her
marble
brow
oft
have
i
taken
sleep
from
thy
vague
arms
and
fondled
her
faint
head
with
poppies
wreath
within
my
bosom
depths
until
its
storms
with
her
were
hushed
and
i
but
mildly
breath
and
then
this
child
o
night
with
frolic
art
arose
from
rest
and
on
my
panting
heart
blew
bubbles
of
dreams
where
elfin
worlds
were
lost
until
my
airy
soul
smiled
light
on
me
from
some
far

a
corpse
unclad
in

i
could
laugh
at

this

were

i
write

as

their

in

in

saffron

between
dim

a
happy
two
we
sailed
and
from
the
shore
all
mystic
in
its
mist
the
soft
gale
bore
the
siren
song
while
on
the
ghostly
steeps
strange
foliage
grew
deeps
folding
upon
deeps
that
hung
and
beamed
with
blossom
and
with
bud
pallid
or
like
urns
of
blood
dripping
and
blowing
from
wide
mouths
of
blooms
on
our
bare
brows
cool
gales
of
sweet
perfumes
while
from
the
yellow
stars
that
splashed
the
skies
our
light
shallop
dropped
soft
mysteries
of
calm
and
sleep
until
the
yellower
moon
rose
full
of
fire
above
a
dark
lagoon
and
as
she
rose
the
nightingales
on
sprays
of
heavy
shadowy
roses
burst
in
praise
of
her
wild
loveliness
with
boisterous
pain
wailing
far
off
around
a
ruined
fane
and
our
lazy
keel
that
dipped
to
swing
the
spirits
of
the
foam
came
whispering
and
from
dank
neptune
caves
heard
the
oceanids
rise
thro
the
waves
saw
their
smooth
limbs
in
the
spray
tumultuous
bosoms
panting
with
their
play
their
oozy
tresses
tossed
unto
the
breeze
flash
brightness
the
tumbled
seas
columned
isles
glance
vaguely
thro
the
trees
we
watched
the
satyrs
chase
the
dryades
heard
pan
fierce
trebles
and
the
triton
horn
sound
from
the
foam
when
rose
the
morn
with
chilly
fingers
dewing
all
the
skies
that
blushed
for
love
and
closed
their
starry
eyes
the
naiad
saw
sweet
smiling
in
white
mist
half
hidden
in
a
bay
of
amethyst
her
polished
limbs
and
at
her
hollow
ear
a
shell
pink
labyrinth
held
up
to
hear
dim
echoes
of
the
siren
haunting
strains
emprisoned
in
its
chords
of
crimson
veins
and
stealing
wily
from
a
grove
of
pines
the
oread
in
cincture
of
green
vines
one
twinkling
foot
half
buried
in
the
red
of
a
deep
dimpled
crumpled
poppy
bed
like
to
the
star
of
eve
when
lapsing
low
faint
clouds
that
with
the
sunset
colors
glow
slip
down
in
scarlet
its
crystal
white
it
shining
partly
veils
its
light
her
lips
in
surprise
and
expectation
in
her
bright
blue
eyes
while
slyly
from
a
young
oak
coppice
peers
the
wanton
faun
with
furry
pointed
ears
he
leaps
she
flies
as
flies
the
startled
nymph
when
pan
pursues
her
from
her
wonted
lymph
diana
sees
and
on
her
wooded
hills
stays
her
fair
band
the
stag
hounds
clamor
stills
already
nearer
glow
the
oread
charms
to
seize
them
faunus
strains
his
hairy
arms
a
senseless
statue
of
white
weeping
stone
fills
his
embrace
the
oread
is
gone
the
bay
dian
resumes
the
chase
while
the
astonished
faun
bewildered
face
paints
all
his
wonderment
and
wondering
he
bends
above
the
sculpture
of
the
spring
we
sailed
and
many
a
morn
of
breathing
balm
purpureal
graced
us
in
that
season
calm
and
it
was
life
to
thee
and
me
and
love
with
the
fair
myths
below
our
god
above
to
sail
in
golden
sunsets
and
emerge
in
golden
morns
upon
a
fretless
surge
but
ah
alas
the
stars
that
dot
the
blue
shine
not
alway
the
clouds
must
gather
too
i
knew
not
how
it
came
but
in
a
while
myself
i
found
cast
on
an
arid
isle
alone
and
barkless
soaked
and
wan
with
dread
the
seas
in
wrath
and
thunder
overhead
deep
down
in
coral
caverns
my
pale
love
no
myths
below
no
god
it
seemed
above
the
dead
oread
her
heart
is
still
and
leaps
no
more
with
holy
passion
when
the
breeze
her
whilom
playmate
as
before
comes
with
the
language
of
the
bees
sad
songs
her
mountain
ashes
sing
and
hidden
fountains
whispering
her
calm
white
feet
erst
fleet
and
fast
as
daphne
when
a
faun
pursued
no
more
will
dance
like
sunlight
past
the
vistas
of
the
wood
where
quailing
floweret
smiled
into
life
where
they
were
set
hers
were
the
limbs
of
living
light
most
beautiful
and
virginal
and
as
godly
white
and
wild
as
beautiful
withal
and
hyacinthine
curls
that
broke
in
color
when
a
wind
awoke
the
wild
aromas
weird
that
haunt
moist
bloomy
dells
and
solitudes
about
her
presence
seemed
to
pant
the
happy
life
of
all
her
moods
ambrosial
smiles
and
amorous
eyes
whose
luster
would
a
god
surprise
her
grave
be
by
a
dripping
rock
a
mossy
dingle
of
the
hill
remote
from
bacchanals
that
mock
the
long
mad
nights
and
still
where
no
unhallowed
pan
with
lust
may
mar
her
melancholy
dust
aphrodite
apollo
never
smote
a
lovelier
strain
when
hebe
paused
her
thirsty
bowl
with
its
wealth
of
to
lend
a
ear
and
smile
on
him
as
that
the
tritons
blew
on
wreathed
horns
when
aphrodite
the
cold
bursting
its
bubbles
from
the
hissing
snow
whirled
her
nude
form
on
hyperion
gaze
naked
and
fresh
as
indian
ocean
shell
dashed
landward
from
its
bed
of
sucking
sponge
and
branching
corals
by
the
changed
monsoon
she
swung
her
white
feet
on
the
sea
and
music
raved
down
the
slant
western
winds
with
swollen
jowls
the
tritons
puffed
the
conch
where
breasting
with
cold
bosoms
the
green
waves
that
laughed
in
ripples
at
love
misty
feet
oceanids
with
palms
smote
sidewise
the
pale
bubbles
of
the
foam
which
wove
a
silver
iris
her
form
where
dolphins
tumbling
stained
the
garish
arch
ner√´ides
sang
braiding
their
wet
locks
or
flung
them
streaming
on
the
broken
foam
till
evetide
showed
her
loveliest
of
stars
lost
of
the
sinking
sun
in
the
cool
sheen
of
shadowy
waters
deep
that
moaned
wild
at
the
sirens
caves
then
in
a
hollow
pearl
waves
the
creatures
of
the
ocean
danced
their
queen
till
cytherea
like
a
rosy
mist
beneath
the
star
rose
blushing
from
the
deep
on
the
pearled
sands
of
a
sea
beneath
the
moon
they
met
she
naked
as
a
star
and
crowned
with
stars
child
of
the
airy
foam
and
queen
of
love
persephone
o
hades
o
false
gods
false
to
yourselves
o
hades
was
thy
brother
gave
her
thee
without
a
mother
sanction
or
her
knowledge
he
bare
her
to
the
horrid
gulfs
below
and
made
her
queen
a
shadowy
queen
of
shades
queen
of
the
fiery
flood
and
mournful
realms
of
grating
iron
and
the
clank
of
chains
on
blossomed
plains
in
far
trinacria
a
maiden
the
dark
cascade
of
whose
hair
seemed
gleaming
rays
of
midnight
the
stars
rays
slowly
a
mellow
moon
she
the
flowers
with
the
oceanids
sought
echo
passion
loved
narcissus
pale
staring
in
the
mirror
of
a
lake
whose
smoothness
brake
his
image
flickering
seen
with
the
fast
tears
of
his
dewy
eyes
a
shape
there
rose
with
iron
wain
and
steeds
sallow
fume
of
sulphur
and
pale
fires
its
countenance
meager
and
its
eyes
such
as
the
wild
ghastly
sulphur
in
its
arms
its
sooty
arms
where
like
to
supple
steel
the
muscles
rigid
lay
unto
its
breast
such
as
its
arms
it
rushed
her
fragile
form
as
bosomed
bulks
of
tempest
in
their
joy
with
arms
of
winds
drag
to
their
black
embrace
a
fairy
mist
of
white
that
flecks
the
summer
with
shadeless
wings
of
gauze
and
is
no
more
heaved
on
the
rapture
of
its
thundering
heart
the
snowy
flowers
shuddered
and
grew
still
with
withered
faces
bowed
and
on
the
stream
where
all
the
day
it
was
their
wont
to
stand
in
silent
sisterhood
at
their
charms
withered
and
limp
and
dead
laid
their
fair
brows
flames
hissed
aloft
like
fiery
whips
of
snakes
blasting
and
killing
all
the
fragrant
sprites
that
make
the
dewy
zephyrs
their
dim
haunts
o
daughters
of
oceanus
in
vain
you
seek
your
mate
and
chide
the
flowers
for
hiding
her
their
broad
snowy
palms
nor
is
she
hidden
in
that
pearly
shell
which
like
a
pinky
babe
cast
from
the
sea
moans
at
your
pallid
feet
washed
with
white
spray
but
sitting
by
the
tumbling
blue
of
waves
mourn
to
your
billows
on
the
foamy
sands
the
falseness
of
the
god
who
grasps
the
storm
demeter
demeter
sad
the
wells
of
sorrow
lay
eternal
gushing
in
thy
lonely
path
methinks
i
see
her
now
an
awful
shape
tall
a
dragon
team
in
frenzied
search
from
argive
plains
unto
the
jeweled
shores
of
the
remotest
ind
where
usha
hand
tinged
her
brow
with
kindly
touch
and
savitar
wheeled
genial
thro
the
skies
palmy
regions
of
the
faneless
brahm
in
melancholy
search
i
see
her
roam
the
steep
peaks
of
himalayas
keen
with
the
unmellowed
frosts
of
boreal
storms
then
back
again
with
that
wild
mother
woe
writ
in
the
anguished
fire
of
her
eyes
back
where
old
atlas
groans
weight
of
worlds
and
the
cimmerian
twilight
glooms
the
soul
deep
was
her
sleep
in
persia
haunted
vales
where
many
a
languid
philomela
moaned
the
bursting
sorrow
of
a
bursting
soul
i
see
her
nigh
ionia
swelling
seas
cull
from
the
sands
a
labyrinthine
shell
and
hark
the
mystery
of
its
eery
voice
float
from
the
hollow
windings
of
its
curl
then
cast
it
far
into
the
weedy
sea
to
view
the
flash
like
one
soft
plume
dropped
from
the
wings
of
eros
the
flame
of
helios
car
toward
his
bath
i
see
her
beg
a
coral
flute
of
red
from
a
tailed
triton
and
on
ithakan
rocks
high
seated
at
the
starry
death
of
day
when
selene
rose
from
off
her
salty
couch
to
smile
a
glory
on
her
face
of
sorrow
pipe
forth
sad
airs
that
made
the
sirens
weep
in
their
green
caves
beneath
the
sodden
sands
and
hoar

his

and
still
his

i

her
the
lonely

of

the

fright
from
the
green
of
thickest
boscage
tangling
their
close
covert
with
horror
of
her
torches
and
her
wail
persephone
persephone
till
the
pines
of
rugged
dicte
shuddered
thro
their
cones
and
echo
shrieked
down
in
her
deepest
chasms
a
wild
reply
unto
her
wild
complaint
as
wild
as
when
she
voiced
those

from

saw
the

dancing
on
the

where
nereus
slept
upon

the

of
his

the

wildly
cried

there
tarries
in

that

naught

her

down

beneath

with

of

a

with

as

fierce
fearful

like

waken
though

but
one
mortal
will
waken
the
mermaid
the
moon
in
the
east
is
glowing
i
sit
by
the
moaning
sea
the
mists
down
the
sea
are
blowing
down
the
sea
all
dewily
the
sands
at
my
feet
are
shaking
the
stars
in
the
sky
are
wan
the
mists
for
the
shore
are
making
with
a
glimmer
drifting
on
from
the
mist
comes
a
song
sweet
wailing
in
the
voice
of
a
maid
and
i
hear
her
gown
soft
trailing
as
she
doth
lightly
wade
the
night
hangs
pale
above
me
upon
her
starry
throne
and
i
know
the
maid
doth
love
me
who
maketh
such
sweet
moan
from
out
the
mist
comes
tripping
a
mermaiden
full
fair
across
the
white
sea
skipping
with
locks
of
tawny
hair
her
locks
with
dripping
she
wrings
with
a
snowy
hand
her
dress
is
thinly
clipping
two
breasts
which
perfect
stand
oh
she
was
fair
as
the
heaven
on
an
autumnal
eve
and
my
love
to
her
was
given
when
i
saw
how
she
did
grieve
amort
the
sea
came
speeding
this
sea
sprite
and
my
heart
for
love
was
bleeding
but
its
beating
i
forbade
on
the
strand
where
the
sand
was
rocking
she
stood
and
sang
an
air
and
the
winds
in
her
hair
kept
locking
their
fingers
cool
and
bare
soft
in
her
arms
did
she
fold
me
while
sweet
and
low
she
moaned
her
love
and
her
grief
she
told
me
and
the
ocean
sighed
and
groaned
but
i
stilled
my
heart
wild
beating
for
i
knew
her
love
was
dim
full
coldly
received
her
greeting
tho
my
life
burnt
in
each
limb
in
my
ear
right
sweet
she
was
sighing
with
the
voice
of
the
shells
her
arms
my
neck
kept
tying
and
gazed
in
mine
eyes
deep
wells
with
her
kisses
cold
did
she
woo
me
but
i
dimmed
my
heart
wild
beat
with
the
stars
of
her
eyes
did
she
sue
me
but
their
passion
did
mine
defeat
with
the
cloud
of
her
tresses
she
veiled
her
beautiful
face
and
oh
how
i
longed
for
her
kisses
and
sighed
for
her
soft
embrace
but
out
in
the
mist
she
went
wailing
when
the
dawn
besilvered
the
night
with
her
robes
of
samite
trailing
in
the
sad
and
white
like
a
spirit
grieved
went
moaning
in
a
twilight
over
the
sea
and
it
seemed
the
night
was
groaning
and
my
heart
beat
wild
in
me
but
i
hushed
my
heart
fierce
beating
for
a
mermaid
false
was
she
yet
i
sighed
at
her
faintly
fleeting
across
the
dim
dark
sea
the
moon
all
withered
is
glowing
the
mist
and
she
are
gone
my
heart
to
ice
is
growing
and
i
sob
at
the
coming
dawn
the
punishment
of
loke
the
gods
of
asaheim
incensed
with
loke
a
whirlwind
yoked
with
steeds
and
carried
thus
boomed
the
booming
seas
far
as
the
teeming
wastes
of
jotunheim
to
punish
loke
for
all
his
wily
crimes
they
found
him
sitting
nigh
a
which
flashing
roared
from
crags
of
ribbed
snow
lamenting
strange
and
weird
in
rushing
notes
of
the
old
str√∂mkarl
who
therein
smote
a
harp
and
sang
in
mystic
syllables
of
runes
for
is
the
wild
man
harp
and
voice
you
hear
he
sits
behind
the
crackling
cataract
within
a
grotto
dim
of
mist
and
foam
his
long
thin
beard
white
as
the
flying
spray
flung
to
the
midnight
in
a
sounding
cave
by
the
blind
fish
that
leap
against
the
winds
gemmed
with
the
large
dews
of
the
cataract
swings
in
the
sucking
breeze
and
swinging
beats
time
to
his
harp
strains
soft
and
sad
beneath
the
talons
of
his
pale
lean
hand
and
all
the
waters
leaping
tingling
shake
like
shivering
stars
within
the
frozen
skies
when
as
the
giants
of
frost
rule
the
deep
and
nip
their
buds
with
fingers
hoar
of
ice
here
banished
found
they
loke
beneath
the
faint
arch
of
young
bifrost
sate
his
foxy
face
between
large
naked
knees
deep
wily
eyes
fixed
on
the
darting
fish
in
seeming
thought
but
aye
one
corner
wan
flashed
at
the
asas
where
they
clustered
fair
soft
on
a
mountain
aged
locks
of
snow
their
tawny
tresses
ruddy
in
the
wind
then
thor
sprang
forth
red
was
his
beard
forked
with
the
livid
light
that
clings
among
the
tempest
locks
of
bale
or
fillets
her
tumultuous
temples
black
and
drops
with
wild
confusion
on
the
hills
and
thro
his
beard
like
to
the
storm
strong
voice
his
sullen
words
were
strained
and
when
he
spake
the
oldest
forests
bowed
their
crowns
of
leaves
and
barmy
skulls
of
mead
were
stayed
within
valhalla
and
heroes
great
were
dumb
as
when
the
horror
of
the
and
all
the
plains
and
skies
of
thule
are
gorged
with
gore
and
screams
of
those
that
fight
or
die
the
valkyries
in
their
helms
flash
from
the
windy
sunset
mists
of
red
unto
the
dead
whose
beaten
casques
and
shields
with
sapless
limbs
wave
the
billows
that
roar
along
the
baltic
wintry
coast
and
wail
amid
the
coves
to
cull
dead
heroes
for
the
hall
of
shields
where
yells
the
toast
and
rings
the
tournament
a
dumbness
falls
upon
the
shattered
field
the
clinging
billows
the
restless
dead
moan
their
eyes
and
glassy
sleep
and
all
the
banners
gustless
dark
hard
ashen
faces
waiting
for
the
choice
the
thunderer
did
loke
shrewd
ensnare
incensed
for
pristine
evil
wrought
on
him
when
erst
dark
loke
deflowered
his
spouse
fair
sif
the
blue
eyed
of
her
golden
baby
locks
him
the
asas
dragged
beneath
a
burning
mount
into
a
cavern
black
by
earthquakes
rent
when
earth
was
young
to
heave
her
spawn
of
trolls
the
vermin
which
engendered
in
the
corpse
of
ymer
huge
whose
flesh
did
make
the
world
here
where
the
stars
shone
nor
nature
strains
of
legendary
woodlands
peaks
and
streams
ere
came
they
pinned
him
supine
to
the
rocks
whose
frigid
touch
filed
at
his
brittle
bones
and
tore
a
groan
from
lips
of
froth
that
made
the
warty
reptiles
cold
and
huge
hiss
from
their
midnight
lairs
and
blaze
great
eyes
lone
in
the
night
he
heard
the
white
bear
roar
from
some
berge
that
stemmed
dark
seas
with
all
its
moan
of
torrents
foaming
down
the
of
its
crystal
mountain
crests
and
the
firry
steep
a
wild
swine
shrieked
and
fought
the
snarling
wolf
his
midriff
ripped
with
ivories
where
the
moss
was
far
down
within
the
horror
of
a
gorge
and
once
he
saw
souls
of
dead
mortals
whirl
with
hair
within
the
arctic
skies
and
all
his
stolid
face
was
eddied
by
one
faint
smile
which
grimly
flash
and
pass
and
he
knew
not
its
stonyness
had
changed
and
all
was
rock
above
him
rock
beneath
and
all
the
clammy
crawling
things
that
spat
black
venom
at
him
from
deep
dens
of
rock
and
that
swart
boundless
flood
of
flowing
death
which
with
its
sooty
spray
clung
to
a
cliff
and
slid
beside
his
marble
gaze
to
him
were
as
the
rock
that
curled
above
and
hung
were
as
the
rock
that
spread
beneath
and
pierced
for
as
to
the
blind
to
him
were
lidless
eyes
and
pity
was
not
darker
than
it
was
and
crammed
with
terrors
populous
as
or
that
cursed
dome
of
corpses
naastrand
dire
whose
roofs
and
walls
of
yawning
serpents
slick
hang
writhing
down
flat
heads
of
snakes
from
whose
red
hissing
fangs
flow
slimy
streams
of
venom
to
a
flood
wherein
the
basest
shades
eternal
wade
and
feel
the
anguish
crawling
down
the
neck
or
glue
the
hair
or
glut
the
dull
dead
ear
or
choke
the
blasted
eye
until
it
swims
in
lurid
pain
and
blazes
the
source
the
roar
of
waters
and
the
wail
of
pines
when
whirlwinds
roll
the
granite
bowlders
down
from
flinty
crags
of
storm
to
bellowing
seas
on
noisome
winds

the

to
writhe
and
swift
pour
down
a
tempest
steep
of
woe
huge
skade
of
winter
daughter
giantess
one
twisting
serpent
hung
above
loke
head
so
that
the
blistering
slaver
might
splash
down
upon
his
chalky
face
and
torture
him
for
so
the

willed
for
his

crimes

loke
wife

endured
not
this
and
brooked
not

behold
her

she
sate
herself
beside
his
writhen
limbs
and
held
a
cup
to
cull
the
venomed
dew
which
flamed
the
scowling
blackness
as
it
fell
to
him
she
spake
who
swelled
his
breast
and
groaned
as
some
mighty
sea
when
its
waves
the
huge
leviathan
by
whalers
chased
cleaving
thick
waters
in
his

fall
in
the
soft

thy
face
which
glimmers
thro
the
night
so
pale
and
knew
i
death
as
mortals
know
i
say
that
he
mysterious
had
on
thee
laid
hands
of
talons
and
so
slain
thy
soul
so
still
and
all
the
night
bears
down
my
heart
so
pale
and
sleep
is
lost
to
thee
and
me
sleep
that
were
welcome
in
this
heavy
gloom
it
clings
to
me
like
pestilential
fogs
i
seem
but
clodded
filth
and
float
in
filth
it
chokes
my
words
and
claws
them
from
my
tongue
to
sound
as
dull
confus√®d
as
the
boom
heard
thro
the
stagnant
earth
when
armies
meet
with
ring
of
on
the
brazen
helms
and
all
the
mountains
clash
unto
the
sound
of
shocking
spears
that
splinter
on
gray
ore
for
by
dead
banks
of
stone
my
words
are
yelled
while
yet
they
touch
the
tongue
to
grasp
the
thought
and
all
the
creatures
huddled
in
their
holes
creep
forth
to
glare
and
hiss
them
back
again
yet
for
thy
love
o
loke
could
i
brave
all
trebled
horrors
that
wise
odin
may
heap
on
and
love
thee
all
the
more
for
thou
dost
love
me
and
this
life
is
naught
without
thy
majesty
of
form
and
mind
for
dark
to
all
alone
art
fair
to
me
and
to
thy
level
and
thy
passions
all
i
raise
the
puny
hillock
of
my
soul
tho
oft
it
droops
below
thy
lofty
height
far
the
crimson
clouds
of
windless
dawns
reaching
the
ruby
of
a
glorious
crest
and
then
aspire
i
not
but
cower
in
awe
down
low
printless
winds
that
take
no
at
least
my
countenance
may
win
from
thee
a
reflex
of
that
alabaster
cold
that
stones
thy
brow
and
pale
in
kindred
woe
and
when
this
stony
brow
of
thine
is
cleft
by
myriad
furrows
tortures
of
slow
time
and
all
the
beauties
of
thy
locks
are
past
now
glossy
as
the
brown
seal
velvet
fur
their
drifts
of
winter
strown
around
this
cave
to
gray
the
glutton
gloom
that
hangs
like
lead
for
idunn
fruit
is
now
debarred
thy
lips
and
thou
shalt
age
as
i
age
with
thee
then
will
the
thought
of
that
dread
twilight
cheer
the
burthen
of
thy
anguish
for
wilt
thou
not
in
the
great
annihilation
aid
of
gods
and
worlds
that
roll
thro
misty
grooves
of
cycled
ages
to
wild
ragnaroke
then
shalt
thou
joy
for
all
those
stars
which
glue
their
blinking
scales
unto
old
ymer
skull
in
clots
shall
fall
and
as
this
brooding
night
sticks
to
and
gluts
us
till
we
strangling
clutch
with
purple
lips
for
air
and
feel
but
frost
drag
laboring
down
the
throat
to
swell
the
freight
that
cuddles
to
the
heart
and
clogs
its
life
so
shall
those
falling
flakes
spread
far
in
lakes
of
flame
and
foggy
pestilence
the
hot
earth
and
drown
all
men
and
gods
but
oh
thy
face
pale
pale
its
marble
gleams
thro
the
thick
night
and
low
the
serpent
wreathes
and
twists
his
scaly
coils
that
livid
hang
above
thee
alabaster
as
a
shrine
oh
could
i
kiss
the
lips
toward
which
he
writhes
and
yield
them
the
last
spark
of
living
flame
that
burns
in
my
wan
blood
and
yielding
die
oh
could
i
gaze
once
more
into
large
eyes
whose
liquid
depths
glassed
domes
of
molten
stars
and
see
them
as
they
glowed
when
morning
danced
scattered
flowers
from
the
rosy
hills
that
lined
the
orient
skies
beneath
one
star
when
first
we
met
and
loved
among
the
pines
the
melancholy
pines
that
plumed
the
cliffs
and
rocked
and
sang
unto
the
smooth
fiords
like
old
wild
women
to
their
sleeping
babes
then
could
i
die
as
the
mortals
die
and
smile
in
dying
but
the
reptile
baulks
all
effort
to
behold
or
on
white
lips
to
feast
the
ardor
of
my
vain
desire
thy
face
alone
shines
on
my
straining
sight
like
some
dim
moon
beneath
a
night
of
mist
and
now
the
creatures
come
to
feel
at
me
the
serpent
swings
above
and
darts
his
fang
and
i
can
naught
but
hold
the
cup
and
breathe
then
thro
the
blackness
of
the
dripping
cave
tumultuous
spake
he
rage
his
utterance
large
as
the
thunder
when
it
lunging
rolls
heavy
with
earthquake
and
portending
ruin
tempestuous
words
everlasting
seas
dumb
with
the
silence
of
eternal
ice
his
eyes
in
horrid
spasms
and
his
throat
corded
and
gnarled
with
veins
of
boisterous
blood
swollen
with
fury
and
stern
wintery
lips
flaked
with
rebellious
foam
and
agony
for
thwarted
rage
and
baulkment
of
designs
rash
vaunter
of
loud
wrath
one
brawny
fist
convulsed
with
clenchment
in
its
gyve
of
ore
clutched
mad
defiance
and
bold
blasphemy
headlong
for
at
all
gods
that
bow
meek
necks
before
high
odin
throne
yet
all
unhurled
and
vain
as
mists
of
morn
or
foam
on
the
sterile
sands
of
rainy
seas
where
ran
from
whistling
caves
watching
the
tempest
ravened
dragon
wreck
feels
lean
miser
fingers
slippery
already
oily
gold
of
vikings
drowned
reverberated
the
rock
all
his
unburdened
blasphemies
again
flung
back
a
million
fold
from
riotous
throats
in
which
demoniac
laughter
howled
and
roared
bellowing
tremendous
tumult
till
his
ears
flooded
and
gorged
with
maniac
curses
grew
stunned
deaf
and
senseless
and
the
rebel
words
erst
rolled
and
thundered
in
his
godly
speech
recoiled
in
oaths
that
shrunk
in
serpent
loops
coiled
mad
anathemas
of
violence
about
his
heart
of
ice
that
now
in
wasted
wrath
of
bitter
foam
which
burst
and
bare
big
ineffectual
groans
wretched
and
huge
with
infinite
weariness
spent
all
its
storm
of
ponderous
misery
her
sorrow
found
some
vent
in
rain
of
tears
and
all
the
cave
was
dumb
and
dead
with
night
unbroken
save
of
sigin
heaving
sobs
or
the
baulked
god
deep
groans
where
chain
he
lay
to
see
the
spotted
serpent
crisp
above
and
aye
gape
poison
at
his
lidless
eyes
and
when
her
bowl
was
brimmed
till
one
more
drop
had
cast
the
fifth
white
the
scorching
edge
into
the
black
deep
flood
beside
she
poured
its
stagnant
torture
one
second
tithe
the
time
the
reptile
bale
blurs
all
his
milky
cheek
burns
to
his
bones
he
starting
fell
stiff
twists
the
sinewy
steel
that
hugs
his
massive
limbs
and
shrieks
so
loud
within
those
solitudes
the
caverns
yawn
unto
the
stormy
skies
the
orey
mountains
rock
and
groan
for
fear
high
spew
their
fiery
thunders
smoke
and
stones
and
this
all
in
a
dim
and
numb
where
giants
reign
rude
kings
in
holds
of
ice
based
on
high
vivid
frozen
cliffs
the
bandit
castles
of
the
northern
wastes
beneath
the
shimmering
dance
of
arctic
lights
which

swathed
in
their
stubborn
mail
of
sleet

the

snarl

their

tall
casement
toward
the
lawn
a
prospect
of
a
wide
extent
glassed
in
her
eyes
and
hateful
shown
along
the
white
lake
windy
crags
blue
with
coarse
brakes
and
ragged
pines
a
bandit
keep
with
trembling
flags
and
barren
scars
and
waste
marsh
lines
and
now
a
palfried
dame
and
knight
deep
forests
old
whose
sinewy
boughs
dark
blocked
the
cave
of
earth
a
blasted
hold
livid
fields
a
torrent
wave
and
the
bridge
whose
marble
arched
the
torrent
foam
dim
in
the
dew
of
morning
one
all
glimmering
marched
in
glittering
steel
from
helm
to
shoe
with
lance
whose
fang
smote
back
the
dawn
iv
selled
on
a
barb
whose
trappings
shone
red
brass
a
morning
star
of
jousts
upon
the
dawning
beaming
lone
burst
from
the
hills
empurpled
crusts
a
lying
star
whose
double
tongue
was
slave
to
gold
i
saw
him
die
is
ruth
for
he
was
brave
and
young
i
saw
him
in
the
close
clay
lie
then
passed
he
rattling
from
the
court
so
grief
in
furrows
ploughed
her
smooth
surface
wan
and
toward
the
eve
the
bloodshot
eve
upon
the
mounts
who
day
bier
did
grieve
and
bow
her
melancholy
star
teenful
eyes
she
bent
the
light
of
her
gem
and
far
she
lingered
till
the
night
showered
the
gray
mere
and
i
like
her
who
trims
a
flame
of
sickly
color
bowing
low
to
balk
the
wind
in
wanton
game
one
stoops
in
secret
toward
her
brow
with
cheeks
a
quick
breath
sends
and
then
the
world
is
blind
with
gloom
and
filled
with
phantoms
and
with
fiends
that
strain
huge
eyes
and
jibe
her
doom
thus
thought
isoud
in
her
despair
of
launcelot
then
thoughts
grew
on
and
arthur
lovely
queen
away
in
castled
courts
of
caerleon
and
all
their
joy
and
dalliance
gay
until
she
could
have
thawed
the
spars
of
her
eyes
to
tears
and
gush
wild
grief
by
wars
of
passionate
anguish
and
great
fears
oh
tristram
gone
oh
death
in
life
soft
down
below
in
the
thick
dark
a
fountain
throbbed
monotonous
foam
unseen
within
the
starlit
park
deep
in
the
tower
shadowed
dome
and
thus
my
heart
drums
frigid
life
in
hateful
gloom
of
fear
and
woe
one
flood
of
sorrow
my
heart
streams
come
and
go
since
tristram
gone
and
i
alone
vi
then
sunk
the
moon
and
far
away
beside
the
bickering
lake
the
towers
of
bandit
braves
shone
tall
and
gray
like
specters
in
her
lonely
hours
and
the
nodding
grove
and
lake
a
glimmering
fawn
stalked
thro
the
night
and
with
full
brow
the
musks
did
take
then
bowed
to
drink
she
veiled
her
sight
and
moaning
said
death
is
but
life
the
fawn
lilies
from
the
mere
sucks
genial
draughts
to
dull
its
thirsts
o
fondest
spirit
art
thou

to
thy
soul
this
soul
that
bursts
the
vivid
lilies
to
the
stars
clasp
their
white
eyes
and
sink
to
sleep
o
anguish
to
thy
burning
wars
lock
my
sad
heart
and
drag
it
deep
albeit
she
slept
she
dreamed
in
grief
beltenebros
at
miraflores
i
the

east
climbs
to
yon
star
that
cradled

herself
in

the
liquid

far

drencheth

holt
down
and
tarn
the
trembling
splendors
gild
the

breath
from
her
tawny

the
clear
green

above

lie
their
lustre
the
dark

tips
of
oriana
sitting
by
the
crested
cock
his
stout
dames
crows
from
the
hill
his
glossy
coat
the
morn
enflames
and
all
his
leaping
heart
doth
thrill
his
curving
tail
sickles
the
plume
that
rosy
nods
against
his
eye
laughs
from
deep
beds
of
twinkling
bloom
the
lilied
east
when
nigh
my
oriana
in
the
gloom
the
rooks
swarm
the
the
falcon
jingles
in
the
air
the
bursting
dawn
around
him
a
clinging
glory
of
wan
glare
from
the
green
knoll
the
shouting
hunt
with
swollen
cheeks
clangs
his
alarms
mayhap
i
hear
the
bristler
grunt
but
where
my
oriana
charms
the
wood
hushed
is
its
haunt
the
willowed
lake
is
cool
with
cloud
breaking
and
dimming
into
shreds
which
gauze
the
azure
thinly
crowd
the
west
with
hazy
threads
a
wild
swan
ruffles
the
mere
soft
as
the
drifting
of
a
soul
a
double
swan
she
doth
appear
in

fixed
pole
and
pole
when
oriana
singeth
near
ii
spring
high
into
the
shuddering
stars
o
florid
sunset
burning

flash
on

lurid
bars
to

them
with
cold
the
blowing
dingles
soak
with

the
purple
coppice
hang
with
blaze
but
where
we
stand
a
meeker
white
bloom
on
us
thro
the
hill
soft
haze
for
oriana
stars
the
night
float
from
the
east
o
silver
world
unto
the
ocean
of
the

and
the
upward
hurled
that
fringe
the

snatch
up
and
gather
thy
brow
in
lustrous
twine
of
rosy
heat
and
rain
on
us
its
starry
glow
o
fragment
of
the
evetide
sheet
and
oriana
eyes
o
courting
cricket
with
thy
pipe
now
shrill
true
love
thro
the
warm
grain
o
feathered

sigh
love
again
thou
glimmering
bird
that
aye
doth
wail
from
some
branch
of
snow
sweep
down
the
moonlit
dale
thy
bubbled
anguish
swooning
low
for
oriana
walks
the
vale
the
moon
comes
sowing
all
the
eve
with
myriad
of
her

the
torrent
on
the

doth
grieve
the
glittering
lake
is
smooth
with

o
mellow

o

the
steep
o
bearded

that
billowing
glide
with
laughing
happy
weep
for
oriana
be
my
bride
the
ideal
thee
have
i
seen
in
some
waste
arden
old
a
maiden
by
a
foaming
stream
with
eyes
profound
and
looks
like
threaded
gold
and
features
like
a
dream
upon
thy
wrist
the
jessied
falcon
fleet
a
silver
poniard
chased
with
imageries
hung
at
a
buckled
belt
while
at
thy
feet
the
gasping
heron
dies
have
fancied
thee
in
some
quaint
ruined
keep
a
maiden
in
chaste
samite
and
her
mien
like
that
of
loved
ones
visiting
our
sleep
or
of
a
fairy
queen
she
where
the
cushioned
ivy
dangling
hoar
disturbs
the
quiet
of
her
sable
hair
pores
a
volume
of
romantic
lore
or
hums
an
olden
air
or
a
fair
bradamant
both
brave
and
just
intense
with
steel
her
proud
face
lit
with
scorn
at
heathen
castles
demons
dens
of
lust
winding
her
bugle
horn
just
as
stern
artegal
in
chastity
a
second
britomart
in
hardihood
like
him
who
king
charles
chivalry
a
pillared
sunbeam
stood
or
one
in
avalon
bowers
on
which
old
yellow
stars
and
waneless
moons
look
softly
while
white
flowers
lisp
faint
and
fragrant
tunes
where
creatures
with
smooth
houri
forms
stoop
thro
the
curling
clouds
and
float
and
smile
while
calm
as
hope
in
all
her
dreamy
charms
sleeps
the
enchanted
isle
and
where
cool
heavy
unstirred
entwine
upon
a
headland
breasting
purple
seas
a
crystal
castle
like
a
thought
divine
rises
in
mysteries
and
there
a
sorceress
full
beautiful
looks
down
the
surgeless
reaches
of
the
deep
and
bubbling
from
her
lily
throat
songs
lull
the
languid
air
to
sleep
about
her
brow
a
diadem
of
spars
at
her
fair
casement
seated
fleecy
white
wild
sirens
choiring
to
the
stars
thro
all
the
raven
night
and
when
she
bends
above
the
waves
she
sees
the
templed
city
old
wrought
from
huge
shells
and
labyrinthine
caves
ribbed
red
with
rusty
gold
but
nor
the
sirens
nor
the
ocean
love
will
she
heed
but
still
sits
yearning
there
to
have
the
secret
bird
that
vaguely
sings
her
aching
heart
to
share
treachery
i
came
a
spicy
smell
of
showers
on
the
purple
wings
of
night
and
a
crescent
on
the
lake
looked
still
and
white
while
a
sound
of
distant
singing
from
the
vales
rose
sad
and
light
ii
dripped
the
musk
of
sodden
roses
from
their
million
heavy
sprays
and
the
nightingales
were
sobbing
of
the
roses
amorous
praise
where
the
raven
down
of
even
caught
the
moonlight
bleaching
rays
iii
and
the
turrets
of
the
palace
from
its
belt
of
ancient
trees
on
the
mountain
rose
romantic
white
as
foam
from
troubled
seas
and
the
murmur
of
an
ocean
smote
the
chords
of
breeze
iv
where
the
moon
shone
on
the
terrace
and
its
fountain
lisping
foam
where
the
bronzen
urns
of
flowers
breathed
faint
perfume
thro
the
gloam
by
the
alabaster
venus
the
quiet
stars
we
roam
and
we
stopped
beside
the
statue
of
the
marble
venus
there
deeply
pedestaled
roses
who
their
crimson
hearts
laid
bare
breathing
out
their
lives
in
fragrance
at
her
naked
feet
and
fair
vi
and
we
marked
the
purple
dingles
where
the
lazy
vapors
lolled
like
thin
fleecy
ribs
of
moonlight
touched
with
amethyst
and
gold
and
we
marked
the
wild
deer
glimmer
like
dim
specters
where
they
strolled
vii
but
from
out
those
roses
crept
a
serpent
and
it
stung
poisoned
him
who
tuned
my
till
for
him
alone
they
sung
froze
the
nerves
of
hands
that
only
from
its
chords
a
note
had
wrung
viii
now
the
nightingales
in
anguish
to
cold
ashen
roses
moan
now
a
sound
of
desolate
wailing
in

rounds
each

the

down

like

and
to
each
stem
that

with

glued
with

it

each

rosebud

its

ghost
the
stiff
elizabethan
pile
chatters
with
cold
thro

and
rumbling
down

the
mad
wind
shakes
his
reins
lone
in

dim
with
immemorial
dust
it
lay
where
each
gaunt

stony

stared
lidless
to
the
day

with

lies
by
a
dingy
cabinet
a

a

set
grotesquely
by
the

a
carven
testered
bedstead
stands
with
rusty
silks
draped
all
about

like
a
moon
in
murky
lands
a
mirror
glitters
out
dark
in
the
northern
angle
where
in
musty
arras
eats
and
clings
the
drowsy
moth
and
frightened
there
the
wild
wind
sighs
and
sings
adown
the
roomy
flue
and
takes
and
swings
the
ghostly
mirror
till
it
shrieks
and
creaks
then
pulls
and
shakes
the
curtains
with
a
will
a
starving
mouse
forever
gnaws
behind
a
polished
panel
dark
and
the
floor
its
shadow
draws
a
poplar
in

there
when

stabbed

dull
stained

dusty
pane
i
have
been
there
at
dead
of
night
but
never

again
she
grew
upon
my
vision
as
heat
sucked
from
the
dry
summer
sod
in
taffetas
as
green
as
grass
silent
and
faint
she
trod
and
angry
jewels
winked
and
frowned
in
serpent
coils
on
neck
and
wrist
and
her
dainty
waist
was
wound
a
zone
of
silver
mist
and
icy
fair
as
some
bleak
land
her
pale
still
face
stormed
with
night
of
raven
tresses
and
her
hand
was
beautiful
and
white
before
the
ebon
mirror
old
full
tearfully
she
made
her
moan
and
then
a
cock
crew
far
and
cold
i
looked
and
she
was
gone
as
if
had
come
a
sullying
breath
and
from
the
limpid
mirror
passed
her
presence
past
like
some
near
death
leaving
my
blood
aghast
tho

there

where

melt
round
her
in
a

haze
the
mirror
an
antique
mirror
this
i
like
it
not
at
all
in
this
lonely
room
where
the
goblin
gloom
scowls
from
the
arrased
wall
a
mystic
mirror
framed
in
ebon
wildly
carved
and
the
prisoned
air
in
the
crevice
there
moans
like
a
man
that
starved
a
truthful
mirror
where
in
the
broad
chaste
light
of
day
from
the
window
arches
like
fairy
torches
red
roses
swing
and
sway
they
blush
and
bow
and
gaze
proud
beauties
desolate
in
their
tresses
cold
the
sunlight
gold
in
their
hearts
a
jealous
hate
a
small
green
worm
that
gnaws
for
the
nightingale
that
low
each
eve
doth
rave
the
passionate
slave
of
the
wild
white
rose
below
the
wails
below
the
stars
creep
out
above
and
the
roses
soon
in
the
sultry
moon
shall
palpitate
with
love
the
sobs
below
the
roses
blow
and
bloom
thro
the
diamond
panes
the
moonlight
rains
in
the
dim
unholy
room
ancestors
grim
that
stare
stiff
starched
and
haughty
down
from
the
oaken
wall
of
the
noble
hall
put
on
a
sterner
frown
the
old
bleak
castle
clock
booms
midnight
overhead
and
the
rose
is
wan
and
the
bird
is
gone
when
walk
the
shrouded
dead
and
grim
ancestors
gaunt
in
smiles
and
tears
faint
flit
by
the
mirror
there
they
stand
and
stare
and

and

it

cast
a
light

rippling

night

i
would
have
thrown
me
her
feet

told
her
all
my
dole

alas
a
black
and
thwarting
cock
crew
from
the
thatch
with
cry
the
elfin
queen
and
her
wee
flock
in
the
night
did
die
in
an
old
garden
the
autumn
pines
and
fades
upon
the
withered
trees
and
over
there
a
choked
despair
you
hear
the
moaning
breeze
the
violets
are
dead
dead
the
tall
hollyhocks
that
hang
like
rags
on
the
flags
and
the
lilies
livid
stocks
the
wild
gourd
clambers
free
where
the
clematis
was
wont
where
nenuphars
waxed
thick
as
stars
rank
weeds
stagnate
the
font
yet
in
my
dreams
i
hear
a
tinkling
mandolin
in
the
dark
blue
light
of
a
fragrant
night
float
in
and
out
and
in
and
the
dewy
vine
that
climbs
to
my
lady
lattice
sways
and
behind
the
vine
there
come
to
shine
two
pleasant
eyes
and
gaze
and
now
a
perfume
comes
a
swift
favonian
gust
and
the
shrinking
grass
where
it
doth
pass
bows
to
the
dust
in
dreams
i
see
her
drift
a
mist
of
drapery
in
her
jeweled
shawl
divinely
tall
a
dian
deity
the
moon
broods
high
and
full
the
broken
psyche
cold
and
there
she
stands
her
dainty
hands
and
thin
wrists
warm
with
gold
but
lovers
now
are
dead
the
air
is
stung
with
frosts
and
naught
may
you
find
save
the
homeless
wind
dead
violets
ghosts
and
ghosts
