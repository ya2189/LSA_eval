day
i
black
riders
came
from
the
sea
there
was
clang
and
clang
of
spear
and
shield
and
clash
and
clash
of
hoof
and
heel
wild
shouts
and
the
wave
of
hair
in
the
rush
upon
the
wind
thus
the
ride
of
sin
ii
three
little
birds
in
a
row
sat
musing
a
man
passed
near
that
place
then
did
the
little
birds
nudge
each
other
they
said
he
thinks
he
can
sing
they
threw
back
their
heads
to
laugh
with
quaint
countenances
they
regarded
him
they
were
very
curious
those
three
little
birds
in
a
row
iii
in
the
desert
i
saw
a
creature
naked
bestial
who
squatting
upon
the
ground
held
his
heart
in
his
hands
and
ate
of
it
i
said
is
it
good
friend
it
is
bitter
bitter
he
answered
but
i
like
it
because
it
is
bitter
and
because
it
is
my
heart
iv
yes
i
have
a
thousand
tongues
and
nine
and
lie
though
i
strive
to
use
the
one
it
will
make
no
melody
at
my
will
but
is
dead
in
my
mouth
v
once
there
came
a
man
who
said
range
me
all
men
of
the
world
in
rows
and
instantly
there
was
terrific
clamor
among
the
people
against
being
ranged
in
rows
there
was
a
loud
quarrel
it
endured
for
ages
and
blood
was
shed
by
those
who
would
not
stand
in
rows
and
by
those
who
pined
to
stand
in
rows
eventually
the
man
went
to
death
weeping
and
those
who
staid
in
bloody
scuffle
knew
not
the
great
simplicity
vi
god
fashioned
the
ship
of
the
world
carefully
with
the
infinite
skill
of
an
made
he
the
hull
and
the
sails
held
he
the
rudder
ready
for
adjustment
erect
stood
he
scanning
his
work
proudly
then
at
fateful
time
a
wrong
called
and
god
turned
heeding
lo
the
ship
at
this
opportunity
slipped
slyly
making
cunning
noiseless
travel
down
the
ways
so
that
forever
rudderless
it
went
upon
the
seas
going
ridiculous
voyages
making
quaint
progress
turning
as
with
serious
purpose
before
stupid
winds
and
there
were
many
in
the
sky
who
laughed
at
this
thing
vii
mystic
shadow
bending
near
me
who
art
thou
whence
come
ye
and
tell
me
is
it
fair
or
is
the
truth
bitter
as
eaten
fire
tell
me
fear
not
that
i
should
quaver
for
i
dare
i
dare
then
tell
me
viii
i
looked
here
i
looked
there
nowhere
could
i
see
my
love
and
this
time
she
was
in
my
heart
truly
then
i
have
no
complaint
for
though
she
be
fair
and
fairer
she
is
none
so
fair
as
she
in
my
heart
ix
i
stood
upon
a
high
place
and
saw
below
many
devils
running
leaping
and
carousing
in
sin
one
looked
up
grinning
and
said
comrade
brother
x
should
the
wide
world
roll
away
leaving
black
terror
limitless
night
nor
god
nor
man
nor
place
to
stand
would
be
to
me
essential
if
thou
and
thy
white
arms
were
there
and
the
fall
to
doom
a
long
way
xi
in
a
lonely
place
i
encountered
a
sage
who
sat
all
still
regarding
a
newspaper
he
accosted
me
sir
what
is
this
then
i
saw
that
i
was
greater
aye
greater
than
this
sage
i
answered
him
at
once
old
old
man
it
is
the
wisdom
of
the
age
the
sage
looked
upon
me
with
admiration
xii
and
the
sins
of
the
fathers
shall
be
visited
upon
the
heads
of
the
children
even
unto
the
third
and
fourth
generation
of
them
that
hate
me
well
then
i
hate
thee
unrighteous
picture
wicked
image
i
hate
thee
so
strike
with
thy
vengeance
the
heads
of
those
little
men
who
come
blindly
it
will
be
a
brave
thing
xiii
if
there
is
a
witness
to
my
little
life
to
my
tiny
throes
and
struggles
he
sees
a
fool
and
it
is
not
fine
for
gods
to
menace
fools
xiv
there
was
crimson
clash
of
war
lands
turned
black
and
bare
women
wept
babes
ran
wondering
there
came
one
who
understood
not
these
things
he
said
why
is
this
whereupon
a
million
strove
to
answer
him
there
was
such
intricate
clamor
of
tongues
that
still
the
reason
was
not
xv
tell
brave
deeds
of
war
then
they
recounted
tales
there
were
stern
stands
and
bitter
runs
for
glory
ah
i
think
there
were
braver
deeds
xvi
charity
thou
art
a
lie
a
toy
of
women
a
pleasure
of
certain
men
in
the
presence
of
justice
lo
the
walls
of
the
temple
are
visible
through
thy
form
of
sudden
shadows
xvii
there
were
many
who
went
in
huddled
procession
they
knew
not
whither
but
at
any
rate
success
or
calamity
would
attend
all
in
equality
there
was
one
who
sought
a
new
road
he
went
into
direful
thickets
and
ultimately
he
died
thus
alone
but
they
said
he
had
courage
xviii
in
heaven
some
little
blades
of
grass
stood
before
god
what
did
you
do
then
all
save
one
of
the
little
blades
began
eagerly
to
relate
the
merits
of
their
lives
this
one
stayed
a
small
way
behind
ashamed
presently
god
said
and
what
did
you
do
the
little
blade
answered
oh
my
lord
memory
is
bitter
to
me
for
if
i
did
good
deeds
i
know
not
of
them
then
god
in
all
his
splendor
arose
from
his
throne
oh
best
little
blade
of
grass
he
said
xix
a
god
in
wrath
was
beating
a
man
he
cuffed
him
loudly
with
thunderous
blows
that
rang
and
rolled
over
the
earth
all
people
came
running
the
man
screamed
and
struggled
and
bit
madly
at
the
feet
of
the
god
the
people
cried
ah
what
a
wicked
man
and
ah
what
a
redoubtable
god
xx
a
learned
man
came
to
me
once
he
said
i
know
the
way
come
and
i
was
overjoyed
at
this
together
we
hastened
soon
too
soon
were
we
where
my
eyes
were
useless
and
i
knew
not
the
ways
of
my
feet
i
clung
to
the
hand
of
my
friend
but
at
last
he
cried
i
am
lost
xxi
there
was
before
me
mile
upon
mile
of
snow
ice
burning
sand
and
yet
i
could
look
beyond
all
this
to
a
place
of
infinite
beauty
and
i
could
see
the
loveliness
of
her
who
walked
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
when
i
gazed
all
was
lost
but
this
place
of
beauty
and
her
when
i
gazed
and
in
my
gazing
desired
then
came
again
mile
upon
mile
of
snow
ice
burning
sand
xxii
once
i
saw
mountains
angry
and
ranged
in
against
them
stood
a
little
man
aye
he
was
no
bigger
than
my
finger
i
laughed
and
spoke
to
one
near
me
will
he
prevail
surely
replied
this
other
his
grandfathers
beat
them
many
times
then
did
i
see
much
virtue
in
grandfathers
at
least
for
the
little
man
who
stood
against
the
mountains
xxiii
places
among
the
stars
soft
gardens
near
the
sun
keep
your
distant
beauty
shed
no
beams
upon
my
weak
heart
since
she
is
here
in
a
place
of
blackness
not
your
golden
days
nor
your
silver
nights
can
call
me
to
you
since
she
is
here
in
a
place
of
blackness
here
i
stay
and
wait
xxiv
i
saw
a
man
pursuing
the
horizon
round
and
round
they
sped
i
was
disturbed
at
this
i
accosted
the
man
it
is
futile
i
said
you
can
never
you
lie
he
cried
and
ran
on
xxv
behold
the
grave
of
a
wicked
man
and
near
it
a
stern
spirit
there
came
a
drooping
maid
with
violets
but
the
spirit
grasped
her
arm
no
flowers
for
him
he
said
the
maid
wept
ah
i
loved
him
but
the
spirit
grim
and
frowning
no
flowers
for
him
now
this
is
it
if
the
spirit
was
just
why
did
the
maid
weep
xxvi
there
was
set
before
me
a
mighty
hill
and
long
days
i
climbed
through
regions
of
snow
when
i
had
before
me
the
it
seemed
that
my
labor
had
been
to
see
gardens
lying
at
impossible
distances
xxvii
a
youth
in
apparel
that
glittered
went
to
walk
in
a
grim
forest
there
he
met
an
assassin
attired
all
in
garb
of
old
days
he
scowling
through
the
thickets
and
dagger
poised
quivering
rushed
upon
the
youth
sir
said
this
latter
i
am
enchanted
believe
me
to
die
thus
in
this
medieval
fashion
according
to
the
best
legends
ah
what
joy
then
took
he
the
wound
smiling
and
died
content
xxviii
truth
said
a
traveller
is
a
rock
a
mighty
fortress
often
have
i
been
to
it
even
to
its
highest
tower
from
whence
the
world
looks
black
truth
said
a
traveller
is
a
breath
a
wind
a
shadow
a
phantom
long
have
i
pursued
it
but
never
have
i
touched
the
hem
of
its
garment
and
i
believed
the
second
traveller
for
truth
was
to
me
a
breath
a
wind
a
shadow
a
phantom
and
never
had
i
touched
the
hem
of
its
garment
xxix
behold
from
the
land
of
the
farther
suns
i
returned
and
i
was
in
a
place
peopled
otherwise
with
grimaces
shrouded
above
in
black
impenetrableness
i
shrank
loathing
sick
with
it
and
i
said
to
him
what
is
this
he
made
answer
slowly
spirit
this
is
a
world
this
was
your
home
xxx
supposing
that
i
should
have
the
courage
to
let
a
red
sword
of
virtue
plunge
into
my
heart
letting
to
the
weeds
of
the
ground
my
sinful
blood
what
can
you
offer
me
a
gardened
castle
a
flowery
kingdom
what
a
hope
then
hence
with
your
red
sword
of
virtue
xxxi
many
workmen
built
a
huge
ball
of
masonry
upon
a
then
they
went
to
the
valley
below
and
turned
to
behold
their
work
it
is
grand
they
said
they
loved
the
thing
of
a
sudden
it
moved
it
came
upon
them
swiftly
it
crushed
them
all
to
blood
but
some
had
opportunity
to
squeal
xxxii
two
or
three
angels
came
near
to
the
earth
they
saw
a
fat
church
little
black
streams
of
people
came
and
went
in
continually
and
the
angels
were
puzzled
to
know
why
the
people
went
thus
and
why
they
stayed
so
long
within
xxxiii
there
was
one
i
met
upon
the
road
who
looked
at
me
with
kind
eyes
he
said
show
me
of
your
wares
and
this
i
did
holding
forth
one
he
said
it
is
a
sin
then
held
i
forth
another
he
said
it
is
a
sin
then
held
i
forth
another
he
said
it
is
a
sin
and
so
to
the
end
always
he
said
it
is
a
sin
and
finally
i
cried
out
but
i
have
none
other
then
did
he
look
at
me
with
kinder
eyes
poor
soul
he
said
xxxiv
i
stood
upon
a
highway
and
behold
there
came
many
strange
pedlers
to
me
each
one
made
gestures
holding
forth
little
images
saying
this
is
my
pattern
of
god
now
this
is
the
god
i
prefer
but
i
said
hence
leave
me
with
mine
own
and
take
you
yours
away
i
buy
of
your
patterns
of
god
the
little
gods
you
may
rightly
prefer
xxxv
a
man
saw
a
ball
of
gold
in
the
sky
he
climbed
for
it
and
eventually
he
achieved
it
it
was
clay
now
this
is
the
strange
part
when
the
man
went
to
the
earth
and
looked
again
lo
there
was
the
ball
of
gold
now
this
is
the
strange
part
it
was
a
ball
of
gold
aye
by
the
heavens
it
was
a
ball
of
gold
xxxvi
i
met
a
seer
he
held
in
his
hands
the
book
of
wisdom
sir
i
addressed
him
let
me
read
child
he
began
sir
i
said
think
not
that
i
am
a
child
for
already
i
know
much
of
that
which
you
hold
aye
much
he
smiled
then
he
opened
the
book
and
held
it
before
strange
that
i
should
have
grown
so
suddenly
blind
xxxvii
on
the
horizon
the
peaks
assembled
and
as
i
looked
the
march
of
the
mountains
began
as
they
marched
they
sang
aye
we
come
we
come
xxxviii
the
ocean
said
to
me
once
look
yonder
on
the
shore
is
a
woman
weeping
i
have
watched
her
go
you
and
tell
her
this
her
lover
i
have
laid
in
cool
green
hall
there
is
wealth
of
golden
sand
and
pillars
two
white
fish
stand
guard
at
his
bier
tell
her
this
and
more
that
the
king
of
the
seas
weeps
too
old
helpless
man
the
bustling
fates
heap
his
hands
with
corpses
until
he
stands
like
a
child
with
surplus
of
toys
xxxix
the
livid
lightnings
flashed
in
the
clouds
the
leaden
thunders
crashed
a
worshipper
raised
his
arm
hearken
hearken
the
voice
of
god
not
so
said
a
man
the
voice
of
god
whispers
in
the
heart
so
softly
that
the
soul
pauses
making
no
noise
and
strives
for
these
melodies
distant
sighing
like
faintest
breath
and
all
the
being
is
still
to
hear
xl
and
you
love
me
i
love
you
you
are
then
cold
coward
aye
but
beloved
when
i
strive
to
come
to
you
opinions
a
thousand
thickets
my
interwoven
existence
my
life
caught
in
the
stubble
of
the
world
like
a
tender
veil
this
stays
me
no
strange
move
can
i
make
without
noise
of
tearing
i
dare
not
if
love
loves
there
is
no
world
nor
word
all
is
lost
save
thought
of
love
and
place
to
dream
you
love
me
i
love
you
you
are
then
cold
coward
aye
but
beloved
xli
love
walked
alone
the
rocks
cut
her
tender
feet
and
the
brambles
tore
her
fair
limbs
there
came
a
companion
to
her
but
alas
he
was
no
help
for
his
name
was
pain
xlii
i
walked
in
a
desert
and
i
cried
ah
god
take
me
from
this
place
a
voice
said
it
is
no
desert
i
cried
well
but
the
sand
the
heat
the
vacant
horizon
a
voice
said
it
is
no
desert
xliii
there
came
whisperings
in
the
winds
good
bye
good
bye
little
voices
called
in
the
darkness
good
bye
good
bye
then
i
stretched
forth
my
arms
no
no
there
came
whisperings
in
the
wind
good
bye
good
bye
little
voices
called
in
the
darkness
good
bye
good
bye
xliv
i
was
in
the
darkness
i
could
not
see
my
words
nor
the
wishes
of
my
heart
then
suddenly
there
was
a
great
light
let
me
into
the
darkness
again
xlv
tradition
thou
art
for
suckling
children
thou
art
the
enlivening
milk
for
babes
but
no
meat
for
men
is
in
thee
then
but
alas
we
all
are
babes
xlvi
many
red
devils
ran
from
my
heart
and
out
upon
the
page
they
were
so
tiny
the
pen
could
mash
them
and
many
struggled
in
the
ink
it
was
strange
to
write
in
this
red
muck
of
things
from
my
heart
xlvii
think
as
i
think
said
a
man
or
you
are
abominably
wicked
you
are
a
toad
and
after
i
had
thought
of
it
i
said
i
will
then
be
a
toad
xlviii
once
there
was
a
man
oh
so
wise
in
all
drink
he
detected
the
bitter
and
in
all
touch
he
found
the
sting
at
last
he
cried
thus
there
is
nothing
no
life
no
joy
no
pain
there
is
nothing
save
opinion
and
opinion
be
damned
xlix
i
stood
musing
in
a
black
world
not
knowing
where
to
direct
my
feet
and
i
saw
the
quick
stream
of
men
pouring
ceaselessly
filled
with
eager
faces
a
torrent
of
desire
i
called
to
them
where
do
you
go
what
do
you
see
a
thousand
voices
called
to
me
a
thousand
fingers
pointed
look
look
there
i
know
not
of
it
but
lo
in
the
far
sky
shone
a
radiance
ineffable
divine
a
vision
painted
upon
a
pall
and
sometimes
it
was
and
sometimes
it
was
not
i
hesitated
then
from
the
stream
came
roaring
voices
impatient
look
look
there
so
again
i
saw
and
leaped
unhesitant
and
struggled
and
fumed
with
outspread
clutching
fingers
the
hard
hills
tore
my
flesh
the
ways
bit
my
feet
at
last
i
looked
again
no
radiance
in
the
far
sky
ineffable
divine
no
vision
painted
upon
a
pall
and
always
my
eyes
ached
for
the
light
then
i
cried
in
despair
i
see
nothing
oh
where
do
i
go
the
torrent
turned
again
its
faces
look
look
there
and
at
the
blindness
of
my
spirit
they
screamed
fool
fool
fool
l
you
say
you
are
holy
and
that
because
i
have
not
seen
you
sin
aye
but
there
are
those
who
see
you
sin
my
friend
li
a
man
went
before
a
strange
god
the
god
of
many
men
sadly
wise
and
the
deity
thundered
loudly
fat
with
rage
and
puffing
kneel
mortal
and
cringe
and
grovel
and
do
homage
to
my
particularly
sublime
majesty
the
man
fled
then
the
man
went
to
another
god
the
god
of
his
inner
thoughts
and
this
one
looked
at
him
with
soft
eyes
lit
with
infinite
comprehension
and
said
my
poor
child
lii
why
do
you
strive
for
greatness
fool
go
pluck
a
bough
and
wear
it
it
is
as
sufficing
my
lord
there
are
certain
barbarians
who
tilt
their
noses
as
if
the
stars
were
flowers
and
thy
servant
is
lost
among
their
fain
would
i
have
mine
eyes
even
with
their
eyes
fool
go
pluck
a
bough
and
wear
it
liii
i
blustering
god
stamping
across
the
sky
with
loud
swagger
i
fear
you
not
no
though
from
your
highest
heaven
you
plunge
your
spear
at
my
heart
i
fear
you
not
no
not
if
the
blow
is
as
the
lightning
blasting
a
tree
i
fear
you
not
puffing
braggart
ii
if
thou
can
see
into
my
heart
that
i
fear
thee
not
thou
wilt
see
why
i
fear
thee
not
and
why
it
is
right
so
threaten
not
thou
with
thy
bloody
spears
else
thy
sublime
ears
shall
hear
curses
iii
withal
there
is
one
whom
i
fear
i
fear
to
see
grief
upon
that
face
perchance
friend
he
is
not
your
god
if
so
spit
upon
him
by
it
you
will
do
no
profanity
but
i
ah
sooner
would
i
die
than
see
tears
in
those
eyes
of
my
soul
liv
it
was
wrong
to
do
this
said
the
angel
you
should
live
like
a
flower
holding
malice
like
a
puppy
waging
war
like
a
lambkin
not
so
quoth
the
man
who
had
no
fear
of
spirits
it
is
only
wrong
for
angels
who
can
live
like
the
flowers
holding
malice
like
the
puppies
waging
war
like
the
lambkins
lv
a
man
toiled
on
a
burning
road
never
resting
once
he
saw
a
fat
stupid
ass
grinning
at
him
from
a
green
place
the
man
cried
out
in
rage
ah
do
not
deride
me
fool
i
know
you
all
day
stuffing
your
belly
burying
your
heart
in
grass
and
tender
sprouts
it
will
not
suffice
you
but
the
ass
only
grinned
at
him
from
the
green
place
lvi
a
man
feared
that
he
might
find
an
assassin
another
that
he
might
find
a
victim
one
was
more
wise
than
the
other
lvii
with
eye
and
with
gesture
you
say
you
are
holy
i
say
you
lie
for
i
did
see
you
draw
away
your
coats
from
the
sin
upon
the
hands
of
a
little
child
liar
lviii
the
sage
lectured
brilliantly
before
him
two
images
now
this
one
is
a
devil
and
this
one
is
me
he
turned
away
then
a
cunning
pupil
changed
the
positions
turned
the
sage
again
now
this
one
is
a
devil
and
this
one
is
me
the
pupils
sat
all
grinning
and
rejoiced
in
the
game
but
the
sage
was
a
sage
lix
walking
in
the
sky
a
man
in
strange
black
garb
encountered
a
radiant
form
then
his
steps
were
eager
bowed
he
devoutly
my
lord
said
he
but
the
spirit
knew
him
not
lx
upon
the
road
of
my
life
passed
me
many
fair
creatures
clothed
all
in
white
and
radiant
to
one
finally
i
made
speech
who
art
thou
but
she
like
the
others
kept
cowled
her
face
and
answered
in
haste
anxiously
i
am
good
deed
forsooth
you
have
often
seen
me
not
uncowled
i
made
reply
and
with
rash
and
strong
hand
though
she
resisted
i
drew
away
the
veil
and
gazed
at
the
features
of
vanity
she
shamefaced
went
on
and
after
i
had
mused
a
time
i
said
of
myself
fool
lxi
i
there
was
a
man
and
a
woman
who
sinned
then
did
the
man
heap
the
punishment
all
upon
the
head
of
her
and
went
away
gayly
ii
there
was
a
man
and
a
woman
who
sinned
and
the
man
stood
with
her
as
upon
her
head
so
upon
his
fell
blow
and
blow
and
all
people
screaming
fool
he
was
a
brave
heart
iii
he
was
a
brave
heart
would
you
speak
with
him
friend
well
he
is
dead
and
there
went
your
opportunity
let
it
be
your
grief
that
he
is
dead
and
your
opportunity
gone
for
in
that
you
were
a
coward
lxii
there
was
a
man
who
lived
a
life
of
fire
even
upon
the
fabric
of
time
where
purple
becomes
orange
and
orange
purple
this
life
glowed
a
dire
red
stain
indelible
yet
when
he
was
dead
he
saw
that
he
had
not
lived
lxiii
there
was
a
great
cathedral
to
solemn
songs
a
white
procession
moved
toward
the
altar
the
chief
man
there
was
erect
and
bore
himself
proudly
yet
some
could
see
him
cringe
as
in
a
place
of
danger
throwing
frightened
glances
into
the
air
at
threatening
faces
of
the
past
lxiv
friend
your
white
beard
sweeps
the
ground
why
do
you
stand
expectant
do
you
hope
to
see
it
in
one
of
your
withered
days
with
your
old
eyes
do
you
hope
to
see
the
triumphal
march
of
justice
do
not
wait
friend
take
your
white
beard
and
your
old
eyes
to
more
tender
lands
lxv
once
i
knew
a
fine
song
it
is
true
believe
me
it
was
all
of
birds
and
i
held
them
in
a
basket
when
i
opened
the
wicket
heavens
they
all
flew
away
i
cried
come
back
little
thoughts
but
they
only
laughed
they
flew
on
until
they
were
as
sand
thrown
between
me
and
the
sky
lxvi
if
i
should
cast
off
this
tattered
coat
and
go
free
into
the
mighty
sky
if
i
should
find
nothing
there
but
a
vast
blue
echoless
ignorant
what
then
lxvii
god
lay
dead
in
heaven
angels
sang
the
hymn
of
the
end
purple
winds
went
moaning
their
wings
with
blood
that
fell
upon
the
earth
it
groaning
thing
turned
black
and
sank
then
from
the
far
caverns
of
dead
sins
came
monsters
livid
with
desire
they
fought
wrangled
over
the
world
a
morsel
but
of
all
sadness
this
was
sad
a
arms
tried
to
shield
the
head
of
a
sleeping
man
from
the
jaws
of
the
final
beast
lxviii
a
spirit
sped
through
spaces
of
night
and
as
he
sped
he
called
god
god
he
went
through
valleys
of
black
ever
calling
god
god
their
echoes
from
crevice
and
cavern
mocked
him
god
god
god
fleetly
into
the
plains
of
space
he
went
ever
calling
god
god
eventually
then
he
screamed
mad
in
denial
ah
there
is
no
god
a
swift
hand
a
sword
from
the
sky
smote
him
and
he
was
dead
