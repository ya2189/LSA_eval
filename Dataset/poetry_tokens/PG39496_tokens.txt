poems
on
travel
travels
by
the
fireside
the
ceaseless
rain
is
falling
fast
and
yonder
gilded
vane
immovable
for
three
days
past
points
to
the
misty
main
it
drives
me
in
upon
myself
and
to
the
fireside
gleams
to
pleasant
books
that
crowd
my
shelf
and
still
more
pleasant
dreams
i
read
whatever
bards
have
sung
of
lands
beyond
the
sea
and
the
bright
days
when
i
was
young
come
thronging
back
to
me
in
fancy
i
can
hear
again
the
alpine
torrent
roar
the
on
the
hills
of
spain
the
sea
at
elsinore
i
see
the
convent
gleaming
wall
rise
from
its
groves
of
pine
and
towers
of
old
cathedrals
tall
and
castles
by
the
rhine
i
journey
on
by
park
and
spire
beneath
centennial
trees
through
fields
with
poppies
all
on
fire
and
gleams
of
distant
seas
i
fear
no
more
the
dust
and
heat
no
more
i
fear
fatigue
while
journeying
with
another
feet
many
a
lengthening
league
let
others
traverse
sea
and
land
and
toil
through
various
climes
i
turn
the
world
round
with
my
hand
reading
these
poets
rhymes
from
them
i
learn
whatever
lies
beneath
each
changing
zone
and
see
when
looking
with
their
eyes
better
than
with
mine
own
longfellow
fancies
for
memories
over
the
great
windy
waters
and
over
the
summits
unto
the
sun
and
the
sky
and
unto
the
perfecter
earth
come
let
us
go
to
a
land
wherein
gods
of
the
old
time
wandered
where
every
breath
even
now
changes
to
ether
divine
come
let
us
go
though
withal
a
voice
whisper
world
that
we
live
in
whithersoever
we
turn
still
is
the
same
narrow
crib
is
but
to
prove
limitation
and
measure
a
cord
that
we
travel
let
who
would
and
be
free
go
to
his
chamber
and
think
is
but
to
change
idle
fancies
for
memories
wilfully
falser
is
but
to
go
and
have
been
come
little
bark
let
us
go
clough
the
cry
of
ulysses
i
can
not
rest
from
travel
i
will
drink
life
to
the
lees
all
times
i
have
enjoyed
greatly
have
suffered
greatly
both
with
those
that
loved
me
and
alone
on
shore
and
when
through
scudding
drifts
the
rainy
hyades
vexed
the
dim
sea
i
am
become
a
name
for
always
roaming
with
a
hungry
heart
much
have
i
seen
and
known
cities
of
men
and
manners
climates
councils
governments
myself
not
least
but
honoured
of
them
all
and
drunk
delight
of
battle
with
my
peers
far
on
the
ringing
plains
of
windy
troy
i
am
a
part
of
all
that
i
have
met
yet
all
experience
is
an
arch
wherethrough
gleams
that
untravelled
world
whose
margin
fades
for
ever
and
for
ever
when
i
move
lord
tennyson
the
traveller
remote
unfriended
melancholy
slow
or
by
the
lazy
scheldt
or
wandering
po
or
onward
where
the
rude
carinthian
boor
against
the
houseless
stranger
shuts
the
door
or
where
campania
plain
forsaken
lies
a
weary
waste
expanding
to
the
skies
i
roam
whatever
realms
to
see
my
heart
untravelled
fondly
turns
to
thee
still
to
my
brother
turns
with
ceaseless
pain
and
drags
at
each
remove
a
lengthening
chain
in
all
my
wanderings
round
this
world
of
care
in
all
my
griefs
and
god
has
given
my
share
still
had
hopes
my
latest
hours
to
crown
amidst
these
humble
bowers
to
lay
me
down
to
husband
out
life
taper
at
the
close
and
keep
the
flame
from
wasting
by
repose
i
still
had
hopes
for
pride
attends
us
still
amidst
the
swains
to
show
my
skill
around
my
fire
an
evening
group
to
draw
and
tell
of
all
i
felt
and
all
i
saw
and
as
a
hare
whom
hounds
and
horns
pursue
pants
to
the
place
from
whence
at
first
she
flew
i
still
had
hopes
my
long
vexations
passed
here
to
return
and
die
at
home
at
last
goldsmith
i
travelled
among
unknown
men
i
travelled
among
unknown
men
in
lands
beyond
the
sea
nor
england
did
i
know
till
then
what
love
i
bore
to
thee
is
past
that
melancholy
dream
nor
will
i
quit
thy
shore
a
second
time
for
still
i
seem
to
love
thee
more
and
more
among
thy
mountains
did
i
feel
the
joy
of
my
desire
and
she
i
cherished
turned
her
wheel
beside
an
english
fire
thy
mornings
showed
thy
nights
concealed
the
bowers
where
lucy
played
and
thine
too
is
the
last
green
field
that
lucy
eyes
surveyed
wordsworth
where
lies
the
land
where
lies
the
land
to
which
yon
ship
must
go
fresh
as
a
lark
mounting
at
break
of
day
festively
she
puts
forth
in
trim
array
is
she
for
tropic
suns
or
polar
snow
what
boots
the
inquiry
neither
friend
nor
foe
she
cares
for
let
her
travel
where
she
may
she
finds
familiar
names
a
beaten
way
ever
before
her
and
a
wind
to
blow
yet
still
i
ask
what
haven
is
her
mark
and
almost
as
it
was
when
ships
were
rare
from
time
to
time
like
pilgrims
here
and
there
crossing
the
waters
doubt
and
something
dark
of
the
old
sea
some
reverential
fear
is
with
me
at
thy
farewell
joyous
bark
wordsworth
a
whither
o
splendid
ship
thy
white
sails
crowding
leaning
across
the
bosom
of
the
urgent
west
that
fearest
nor
sea
rising
nor
sky
clouding
whither
away
fair
rover
and
what
thy
quest
ah
soon
when
winter
has
all
our
vales
opprest
when
skies
are
cold
and
misty
and
hail
is
hurling
wilt
thou
glide
on
the
blue
pacific
or
rest
in
a
summer
haven
asleep
thy
white
sails
furling
i
there
before
thee
in
the
country
that
well
thou
knowest
already
arrived
am
inhaling
the
odorous
air
i
watch
thee
enter
unerringly
where
thou
goest
and
anchor
queen
of
the
strange
shipping
there
thy
sails
for
awnings
spread
thy
masts
bare
nor
is
aught
from
the
foaming
reef
to
the
grandest
peak
that
is
over
the
feathery
palms
more
fair
than
thou
so
upright
so
stately
and
still
thou
standest
and
yet
o
splendid
ship
unhailed
and
nameless
i
know
not
if
aiming
a
fancy
i
rightly
divine
that
thou
hast
a
purpose
joyful
a
courage
blameless
thy
port
assured
in
a
happier
land
than
mine
but
for
all
i
have
given
thee
beauty
enough
is
thine
as
thou
aslant
with
trim
tackle
and
shrouding
from
the
proud
nostril
curve
of
a
prow

pause
on
thy

awful
head
o

at

ceaselessly
but
thou
most
awful
form
risest
from
forth
thy
silent
sea
of
pines
how
silently
around
thee
and
above
deep
is
the
air
and
dark
substantial
black
an
ebon
mass
methinks
thou
piercest
it
as
with
a
wedge
but
when
i
look
again
it
is
thine
own
calm
home
thy
crystal
shrine
thy
habitation
from
eternity
o
dread
and
silent
mount
i
gazed
upon
thee
till
thou
still
present
to
the
bodily
sense
didst
vanish
from
my
thought
entranced
in
prayer
i
worshipped
the
invisible
alone
yet
like
some
sweet
beguiling
melody
so
sweet
we
know
not
we
are
listening
to
it
thou
the
meanwhile
wast
blending
with
my
thought
yea
with
my
life
and
life
own
secret
joy
till
the
dilating
soul
enrapt
transfused
into
the
mighty
vision
passing
there
as
in
her
natural
form
swelled
vast
to
heaven
awake
my
soul
not
only
passive
praise
thou
owest
not
alone
these
swelling
tears
mute
thanks
and
secret
ecstasy

voice
of
sweet
song
awake
my
heart
awake
green
vales
and
icy
cliffs

join
my
hymn
thou
first
and
chief
sole
sovereign
of
the
vale
o
struggling
with
the
darkness
all
the
night
and
visited
all
night
by
troops
of
stars
or
when
they
climb
the
sky
or
when
they
sink
companion
of
the
at
dawn
thyself
earth
rosy
star
and
of
the
dawn
wake
o
wake
and
utter
praise
who
sank
thy
sunless
pillars
deep
in
earth
who
filled
thy
countenance
with
rosy
light
who
made
thee
parent
of
perpetual
streams
and
you
ye
five
wild
torrents
fiercely
glad
who
called
you
forth
from
night
and
utter
death
from
dark
and
icy
caverns
called
you
forth
down
those
precipitous
black
jaggèd
rocks
for
ever
shattered
and
the
same
for
ever
who
gave
you
your
invulnerable
life
your
strength
your
speed
your
fury
and
your
joy
unceasing
thunder
and
eternal
foam
and
who
commanded

ye
ye
that
from

mountain
brow

enormous
ravines

amain
torrents
methinks
that
heard
a
mighty
voice
and
stopped
at
once
amid
their
maddest
plunge
motionless
torrents
silent
cataracts
who
made
you
glorious
as
the
gates
of
heaven
beneath
the
keen
full
moon
who
bade
the
sun
clothe
you
with
rainbows
who
with
living
flowers
of
loveliest
blue
spread
garlands
at
your
feet
god
let
the
torrents
like
a
shout
of
nations
answer
and
let
the
echo

god
sing
ye
with
gladsome
voice
ye
with
your
soft
and
sounds
and
they
too
have
a
voice
yon
piles
of
snow
and
in
their
perilous
fall
shall
thunder
god
ye
living
flowers
that
skirt
the
eternal
frost
ye
wild
goats
sporting
round
the
eagle
nest
ye
eagles
of
the
ye
lightnings
the
dread
arrows
of
the
clouds
ye
signs
and
wonders
of
the
element
utter
forth
god
and
fill
the
hills
with
praise
thou
too
hoar
mount
with
thy
peaks
oft
from
whose
feet
the
avalanche
unheard
shoots
downward
glittering
through
the
pure
serene
into
the
depth
of
clouds
that
veil
thy
breast
thou
too

stupendous
mountain
thou
that
as

my
head
awhile
bowed
low
in
adoration
upward
from
thy
base
slow
travelling
with
dim
eyes
suffused
with
tears
solemnly
seemest
like
a
vapoury
cloud

rise

a
cloud

closing
of

and

and
impetuous
recruits
are
renewing
with
the
season
their
continual
disputes
those
inveterate
disputes
on
the
newest
alpine
routes
and
inspecting
the
condition
of
their
mountaineering
boots
you
may
stifle
your
reflections
you
may
banish
them
afar
you
may
try
to
draw
a
solace
from
the
thought

but
your
heart
is
with
those
climbers
and
you

be
crossing

with
your

labelled
leaving

far
astern
with
a
ticket
through

beside
the

just
as
you
were
wont
to
do
with
the
woodland
green
around
them
and
a
shining
through
they
will
tread
the
higher
pastures
where
celestial
breezes
blow
while
the

lies
in
shadow
and
the
peaks
are
all
aglow
where
the
airs
of
heaven
blow
the
pine
woods
and
the
snow
and
the
shades
of
evening
deepen
in
the

far
below
they
will
scale
the

strongholds
that
in

you
won
they
will
plod
behind
a

ere
the
rising
of
the

on
a

in
a
chimney
on
the
steep
and
dizzy
slope
for
a
foothold

a
handhold
they
will
diligently
grope
on
the
rocky
icy
slope
where
we
charitably
hope
is
assistance
only
moral
that
they
getting
from
a
rope
they
will
dine
on
mule
and
marmot
and
on
mutton
made
of
goats
they
will
face
the
various
horrors
of

the

that
lead
them
and
the

whereon
they
fare
they
will
taste

journey
several

at

the

height
of

decaying
never

from

the
summer
day
grow
late
and
darkness
steal
the
wet
grass
with
the
pale
crocus
starred
and
reach
that
glimmering
sheet
of
glass
beneath
the
piny
sward
lake
leman
waters
far
below
and
watched
the
rosy
light
fade
from
the
distant
peaks
of
snow
and
on
the
air
of
night
heard
accents
of
the
eternal
tongue
through
the
pine
branches
play
listened
and
felt
thyself
grow
young
listened
and
wept
away
away
the
dreams
that
but
deceive
and
thou
sad
guide
adieu
i
go
fate
drives
me
but
i
leave
half
of
my
life
with
you
ii
glion
ah
twenty
years
it
cuts
all
meaning
from
a
name
white
houses
prank
where
once
were
huts
glion
but
not
the
same
and
yet
i
know
not
all
unchanged
the
turf
the
pines
the
sky
the
hills
in
their
old
order
ranged
the
lake
with
chillon
by
and
those
where
stiff
and
stony
mounts
the
way
their
crackling
burn
as
if
i
left
them
yesterday
across
the
valley
on
that
slope
the
huts
of
avant
shine
its
pines
under
their
branches
ope
ways
for
the
tinkling
kine
alpine
fare
sweet
heaps
of
grass
invite
to
rest
the
traveller
there
before
he
climb
the
pass
the
pass
its
crown
with
yellow
spires
aflame
whence
drops
the
path
to
allière
down
and
walls
where
byron
came
still
in
my
soul
the
voice
i
heard
of
obermann
away
i
turned
by
some
vague
impulse
stirred
along
the
rocks
of
naye
and
sonchaud
piny
flanks
i
gaze
and
the
blanched
summit
bare
of
malatrait
to
where
in
haze
the
valais
opens
fair
and
the
domed
velan
with
his
snows
behind
the
upcrowding
hills
doth
all
the
heavenly
opening
close
which
the
rhone
murmur
fills
and
glorious
there
without
a
sound
across
the
glimmering
lake
high
in
the
valais
depth
profound
i
saw
the
morning
break
arnold
the
terrace
at
berne
ten
years
and
to
my
waking
eye
once
more
the
roofs
of
berne
appear
the
rocky
banks
the
terrace
high
the
stream
and
do
i
linger
here
the
clouds
are
on
the
oberland
the
jungfrau
snows
look
faint
and
far
but
bright
are
those
green
fields
at
hand
and
through
those
fields
comes
down
the
aar
and
from
the
blue
twin
lakes
it
comes
flows
by
the
town
the
fair
and
the
it
hums
the
house
and
is
my
marguerite
there
arnold
never
oh
never
more
never
oh
never
more
shall
i
behold
a
sunrise
on
the
glacier
stars
of
morn
paling
in
primrose
round
the
crystal
horn
soft
curves
of
crimson
mellowing
into
gold
sapphire
chasm
and
silvery
cold
fire
that
the
horizon
beacons
borne
from
peak
to
peak
forlorn
clear
hallelujahs
through
heaven
arches
rolled
never
oh
never
more
these
feet
shall
feel
the
firm
elastic
tissue
of
upland
turf
or
the
crisp
edge
of
the
high
rocks
or
cling
where
the
embattled
cliffs
beneath
them
reel
through
eddying
like
the
atlantic
surf
far
far
above
the
wheeling
eagle
wing
j
symonds
happy
is
england
happy
is
england
i
could
be
content
to
see
no
other
verdure
than
its
own
to
feel
no
other
breezes
than
are
blown
through
its
tall
woods
with
high
romances
blent
yet
do
i
sometimes
feel
a
languishment
for
skies
italian
and
an
inward
groan
to
sit
upon
an
alp
as
on
a
throne
and
half
forget
what
world
or
worldling
meant
happy
is
england
sweet
her
artless
daughters
enough
their
simple
loveliness
for
me
enough
their
whitest
arms
in
silence
clinging
yet
do
i
often
warmly
burn
to
see
beauties
of
deeper
glance
and
hear
their
singing
and
float
with
them
about
the
summer
waters
keats
the
daisy
written
at
edinburgh
o
love
what
hours
were
thine
and
mine
in
lands
of
palm
and
southern
pine
in
lands
of
palm
of
of
olive
aloe
and
maize
and
vine
what
roman
strength
turbia
showed
in
ruin
by
the
mountain
road
how
like
a
gem
beneath
the
city
of
little
monaco
basking
glowed
how
richly
down
the
rocky
dell
the
torrent
vineyard
streaming
fell
to
meet
the
sun
and
sunny
waters
that
only
heaved
with
a
summer
swell
what
slender
campanili
grew
by
bays
the
peacock
neck
in
hue
where
here
and
there
on
sandy
beaches
a
amaryllis
blew
how
young
columbus
seemed
to
rove
yet
present
in
his
natal
grove
now
watching
high
on
mountain
cornice
and
steering
now
from
a
purple
cove
now
pacing
mute
by
ocean
rim
till
in
a
narrow
street
and
dim
i
stayed
the
wheels
at
cogoletto
and
drank
and
loyally
drank
to
him
nor
knew
we
well
what
pleased
us
most
not
the
clipt
palm
of
which
they
boast
but
distant
colour
happy
hamlet
a
mouldered
citadel
on
the
coast
or
tower
or
high
seen
a
light
amid
its
olives
green
or
cape
in
ocean
or
rosy
blossom
in
hot
ravine
where
oleanders
flushed
the
bed
of
silent
torrents
and
crossing
oft
we
saw
the
glisten
of
ice
far
up
on
a
mountain
head
we
loved
that
hall
tho
white
and
cold
those
nichèd
shapes
of
noble
mould
a
princely
people
awful
princes
the
grave
severe
genovese
of
old
at
florence
too
what
golden
hours
in
those
long
galleries
were
ours
what
drives
about
the
fresh
cascinè
or
walks
in
boboli
ducal
bowers
in
bright
vignettes
and
each
complete
of
tower
or
duomo
or
palace
how
the
city
glittered
thro
cypress
avenues
at
our
feet
but
when
we
crost
the
lombard
plain
remember
what
a
plague
of
rain
of
rain
at
reggio
rain
at
parma
at
lodi
rain
piacenza
rain
and
stern
and
sad
so
rare
the
smiles
of
sunlight
looked
the
lombard
piles
on
the
lion
resting
and
sombre
old
colonnaded
aisles
o
milan
o
the
chanting
quires
the
giant
windows
blazoned
fires
the
height
the
space
the
gloom
the
glory
a
mount
of
marble
a
hundred
spires
i
climbed
the
roofs
at
break
of
day
alps
before
me
lay
i
stood
among
the
silent
statues
and
statued
pinnacles
mute
as
they
how
how
was
monte
rosa
hanging
there
a
thousand
valleys
and
snowy
dells
in
a
golden
air
remember
how
we
came
at
last
to
como
shower
and
storm
and
blast
had
blown
the
lake
beyond
his
limit
and
all
was
flooded
and
how
we
past
from
como
when
the
light
was
grey
and
in
my
head
for
half
the
day
the
rich
virgilian
rustic
measure
of
lari
maxume
all
the
way
like
music
kept
as
on
the
lariano
crept
to
that
fair
port
below
the
castle
of
queen
theodolind
where
we
slept
or
hardly
slept
but
watched
awake
a
cypress
in
the
moonlight
shake
the
moonlight
touching
a
terrace
one
tall
agavè
above
the
lake
what
more
we
took
our
last
adieu
and
up
the
snowy
splugen
drew
but
ere
we
reached
the
highest
summit
i
plucked
a
daisy
i
gave
it
you
it
told
of
england
then
to
me
and
now
it
tells
of
italy
o
love
we
two
shall
go
no
longer
to
lands
of
summer
across
the
sea
so
dear
a
life
your
arms
enfold
whose
crying
is
a
cry
for
gold
yet
here
in
this
dark
city
when
ill
and
weary
alone
and
cold
i
found
though
crushed
to
hard
and
dry
this
nurseling
of
another
sky
still
in
the
little
book
you
lent
me
and
where
you
tenderly
laid
it
by
and
i
forgot
the
clouded
forth
the
gloom
that
saddens
heaven
and
earth
the
bitter
east
the
misty
summer
and
grey
metropolis
of
the
north
perchance
to
lull
the
throbs
of
pain
perchance
to
charm
a
vacant
brain
perchance
to
dream
you
still
beside
me
my
fancy
fled
to
the
south
again
lord
tennyson
cadenabbia
lake
of
como
no
sound
of
wheels
or
breaks
the
silence
of
the
summer
day
as
by
the
loveliest
of
all
lakes
i
while
the
idle
hours
away
i
pace
the
leafy
colonnade
where
level
branches
of
the
plane
above
me
weave
a
roof
of
shade
impervious
to
the
sun
and
rain
at
times
a
sudden
rush
of
air
flutters
the
lazy
leaves
and
gleams
of
sunshine
toss
and
flare
like
torches
down
the
path
i
tread
by
somariva
garden
gate
i
make
the
marble
stairs
my
seat
and
hear
the
water
as
i
wait
lapping
the
steps
beneath
my
feet
the
undulation
sinks
and
swells
along
the
stony
parapets
and
far
away
the
floating
bells
tinkle
upon
the
fisher
nets
silent
and
slow
by
tower
and
town
the
freighted
barges
come
and
go
their
pendent
shadows
gliding
down
by
town
and
tower
submerged
below
the
hills
sweep
upward
from
the
shore
with
villas
scattered
one
by
one
upon
their
wooded
spurs
and
lower
bellagio
blazing
in
the
sun
and
dimly
seen
a
tangled
mass
of
walls
and
woods
of
light
and
shade
stands
beckoning
up
the
stelvio
pass
varenna
with
its
white
cascade
i
ask
myself
is
this
a
dream
will
it
all
vanish
into
air
is
there
a
land
of
such
supreme
and
perfect
beauty
anywhere
sweet
vision
do
not
fade
away
linger
until
my
heart
shall
take
into
itself
the
summer
day
and
all
the
beauty
of
the
lake
linger
until
upon
my
brain
is
stamped
an
image
of
the
scene
then
fade
into
the
air
again
and
be
as
if
thou
hadst
not
been
longfellow
to
verona
verona
thy
tall
gardens
stand
erect
beckoning
me
upward
let
me
rest
awhile
where
the
birds
whistle
hidden
in
the
boughs
or
fly
away
when
idlers
take
their
place
mated
as
well
concealed
as
willingly
idlers
whose
nest
must
not
swing
there
but
rise
beneath
a
gleaming
canopy
of
gold
amid
the
flight
of
cupids
and
the
smiles
of
venus
ever
radiant
their
couch
here
would
i
stay
here
wander
slumber
here
nor
pass
into
that
theatre
below
crowded
with
their
faint
memories
shades
of
joy
but
ancient
song
arouses
me
i
hear
coelius
and
aufilena
i
behold
lesbia
and
lesbia
linnet
at
her
lip
pecking
the
fruit
that
ripens
and
swells
out
for
him
whose
song
the
graces
loved
the
most
whatever
land
east
west
they
visited
even
he
must
not
detain
me
one
there
is
greater
than
he
of
broader
wing
of
swoop
sublimer
open
now
that
humid
arch
where
juliet
sleeps
the
quiet
sleep
of
death
and
romeo
sinks
aside
her
fare
ye
well
lovers
ye
have
not
loved
in
vain
the
hearts
of
millions
throb
around
ye
this
lone
tomb
one
greater
than
yon
walls
have
ever
seen
greater
than
manto
foresaw
in
her
own
child
or
rome
hath
hallowèd
and
the
last
sod
or
stone
a
pilgrim
knee
shall
press
love
swears
it
and
swears
true
is
here
landor
the
apennine
once
more
upon
the
woody
apennine
the
infant
alps
which
had
i
not
before
gazed
on
their
mightier
parents
where
the
pine
sits
on
more
shaggy
summits
and
where
roar
the
thundering
lauwine
might
be
worshipped
more
but
i
have
seen
the
soaring
jungfrau
rear
her
snow
and
seen
the
hoar
glaciers
of
bleak
mont
blanc
both
far
and
near
and
in
chimari
heard
the
of
fear
th
acroceraunian
mountains
of
old
name
and
on
parnassus
seen
the
eagles
fly
like
spirits
of
the
spot
as
for
fame
for
still
they
soared
unutterably
high
i
looked
on
ida
with
a
trojan
eye
athos
olympus
aetna
atlas
made
these
hills
seem
things
of
lesser
dignity
all
save
the
lone
soracte
height
displayed
not
in
snow
which
asks
the
lyric
roman
aid
for
our
remembrance
and
from
out
the
plain
heaves
like
a
wave
about
to
break
and
on
the
curl
hangs
pausing
lord

where
upon

slope
where
upon

slope
with
the
chestnut
the
immingle
where
amid
odorous
copse
wander
and

where
under
the
diligent
rivulet
sparkles

their

over

in

on

from

o
my

with
thee
clough

i
your
ghost
will
walk
you

if
our

remain
in

draw
yourself
up
from

june
ii
what
i
love
best
in
all
the
world
is
a
castle
in
a
gash
of
the
apennine
or
look
for
me
old
fellow
of
mine
if
i
get
my
head
from
out
the
mouth
o
the
grave
and
loose
my
spirit
bands
and
come
again
to
the
land
of
lands
in
a
house
to
the
farther
south
where
the
baked
cicalas
die
of
drouth
and
one
sharp
tree
is
a
cypress
stands
by
the
many
hundred
years
rough
ripe
my
sentinel
to
guard
the
sands
to
the
water
edge
for
what
expands
before
the
house
but
the
great
opaque
blue
breadth
of
sea
without
a
break
while
in
the
house
for
ever
crumbles
some
fragment
of
the
frescoed
walls
from
blisters
where
a
scorpion
sprawls
a
girl
brings
and
tumbles
down
on
the
pavement

and
says

for
me
when

lost
her

open
my
heart
and
you
will
see
graved

of
it
such
lovers
old
are
i
and
she
so
it
always
was
so
shall
ever
be
browning
venice
there
is
a
glorious
city
in
the
sea
the
sea
is
in
the
broad
the
narrow
streets
ebbing
and
flowing
and
the
salt
clings
to
the
marble
of
her
palaces
no
track
of
men
no
footsteps
to
and
fro
lead
to
her
gates
the
path
lies
the
sea
invisible
and
from
the
land
we
went
as
to
a
floating
city
steering
in
and
gliding
up
her
streets
as
in
a
dream
so
smoothly
silently
by
many
a
dome
and
many
a
stately
portico
the
statues
ranged
along
an
azure
sky
by
many
a
pile
in
more
than
eastern
pride
of
old
the
residence
of
the
fronts
of
some
though
time
had
shattered
them
still
glowing
with
the
richest
hues
of
art
as
though
the
wealth
within
them
had
run
rogers
ocean
nursling
underneath

azure

nursling
venice
lies
a
peopled
labyrinth
of
walls
amphitrite
destined
halls
which
her
hoary
sire
now
paves
with
his
blue
and
beaming
waves
lo
the
sun
upsprings
behind
broad
red
radiant
on
the
level
quivering
line
of
the
waters
crystalline
and
before
that
chasm
of
light
as
within
a
furnace
bright
column
tower
and
dome
and
spire
shine
like
obelisks
of
fire
pointing
with
inconstant
motion
from
the
altar
of
dark
ocean
to
the
skies
as
the
flames
of
sacrifice
from
the
marble
shrines
did
rise
as
to
pierce
the
dome
of
gold
where
apollo
spoke
of
old
city
thou
hast
been
ocean
child
and
then
his
queen
now
is
come
a
darker
day
and
thou
soon
must
be
his
prey
if
the
power
that
raised
thee
here
hallow
so
thy
watery
bier
shelley
venice
i
stood
in
venice
on
the
bridge
of
sighs
a
palace
and
a
prison
on
each
hand
i
saw
from
out
the
wave
her
structures
rise
as
from
the
stroke
of
the
enchanter
wand
a
thousand
years
their
cloudy
wings
expand
around
me
and
a
dying
glory
smiles
the
far
times
when
many
a
subject
land
looked
to
the
wingèd
lion
marble
piles
where
venice
sate
in
state
throned
on
her
hundred
isles
she
looks
a
sea
cybele
fresh
from
ocean
rising
with
her
tiara
of
proud

half
undrawn
within
the

stand

in

behold
what

can
make
when
nature
self
would
fail
and
to
the
fond
idolaters
of
old
envy
the
innate
flash
which
such
a
soul
could
mould
lord
byron
an
invitation
to
rome
oh
come
to
rome
it
is
a
pleasant
place
your
london
sun
is
here
seen
shining
brightly
the
briton
too
puts
on
a
cheery
face
and
bull
is
suave
and
even
sprightly
the
romans
are
a
kind
and
cordial
race
the
women
charming
if
one
takes
them
rightly
i
see
them
at
their
doors
as
day
is
closing
more
proud
than
duchesses
and
more
imposing
a
life
promotes
the
graces
they
pass
from
dreamy
bliss
to
wakeful
glee
and
in
their
bearing
and
their
speech
one
traces
a
breadth
of
grace
and
depth
of
courtesy
that
are
not
found
in
more
inclement
places
their
clime
and
tongue
seem
much
in
harmony
the
cockney
met
in
middlesex
or
surrey
is
often
cold
and
always
in
a
hurry
though
is
their
passion
they
seem
here
most
eloquent
in
things
most
slight
no
matter
what
it
is
they
have
to
say
the
manner
always
sets
the
matter
right
and
when
they
plagued
or
pleased
you
all
the
day
they
sweetly
wish
you
most
happy
night
then
if
they
fib
and
if
their
stories
tease
you
is
always
something
that
they
wished
to
please
you
oh
come
to
rome
nor
be
content
to
read
alone
of
stately
palaces
and
streets
whose
fountains
ever
run
with
joyful
speed
and
murmur
here
one
meets
great
memnon
monoliths
or
gay
with
weed
rich
capitals
as
or
seats
the
sites
of
vanished
temples
where
now
moulder
old
ruins
hiding
ruin
even
older
ay
come
and
see
the
pictures
statues
churches
although
the
last
are
commonplace
or
some
say
is
here
that
superstition
perches
myself
i
glad
the
marbles
have
been
quarried
the
sombre
streets
are
worthy
your
researches
the
ways
are
foul
the
lava
pavement
horrid
but
pleasant
sights
that
squeamishness
disparages
are
missed
by
all
who
roll
about

about

a

splendid

if
i
breathe
the

of

gentlemen
it
is
that
love
casts
out
my
fear
and
so
i
claim
with
him
a
kindredship
ah
when
we
love
the
name
is
on
our

engraven
as
is
thy

decline
thus

affront
the

with
their
flaring
some
day
in

our

we
combine
just
you

i
and
try
a

i

this

upon

a

plucked
where
beauty
lingers
round

the

buried

so
dead
that

which
the

the
gaze
again
to
fade
away
they
wait
and
pine
for
what
is
long
denied

thus
i
wait
till
thou
art
by
my
side
far
away
yet
while
i
write
i
still
seem
gently
sweet
to
press
thy
hand
in

can
not
bring
myself
to
drop
the

i
can
not
yet
thy
little
hand
resign
the
plain

fading
into
darkness
chill
the
sabine
peaks
are
flushed
with
light
divine
i
watch
alone
my
fond
thought
wings
to
thee
oh
come
to
rome
oh
come
oh
come
to
me
the
coliseum
i
do
remember
me
that
in
my
youth
when
i
was
wandering
upon
such
a
night
i
stood
within
the
coliseum
wall
the
chief
relics
of
almighty
rome
the
trees
which
grew
along
the
broken
arches
waved
dark
in
the
blue
midnight
and
the
stars
shone
through
the
rents
of
ruin
from
afar
the
bayed
beyond
the
tiber
and
more
near
from
out
the
caesar
palace
came
the
owl
long
cry
and
interruptedly
of
distant
sentinels
the
fitful
song
begun
and
died
upon
the
gentle
wind
some
cypresses
beyond
the
breach
appeared
to
skirt
the
horizon
yet
they
stood
within
a
bowshot
where
the
caesars
dwelt
and
dwell
the
tuneless
birds
of
night
amidst
a
grove
which
springs
through
levelled
battlements
and
twines
its
roots
with
the
imperial
hearths
ivy
usurps
the
laurel
place
of
growth
but
the
gladiators
bloody
circus
stands
a
noble
wreck
in
ruinous
perfection
while
caesar
chambers
and
the
augustan
halls
grovel
on
earth
in
indistinct
decay
and
thou
didst
shine
thou
rolling
moon
upon
all
this
and
cast
a
wide
and
tender
light
which
softened
down
the
hoar
austerity
of
rugged
desolation
and
filled
up
as
were
anew
the
gaps
of
centuries
leaving
that
beautiful
which
still
was
so
and
making
that
which
was
not
till
the
place
became
religion
and
the
heart
ran
with
silent
worship
of
the
great
of
old
the
dead
but
sceptred
sovereigns
who
still
rule
our
spirits
from
their
urns

the

it

had
no
power
to
unbind

ye

go

that

with

from

i
longed
to
tread
this
classic

am
i
here
at

wandering
at

through
the
long
porticoes
and
catching
as
through
some
majestic
grove
now
the
blue
ocean
and
now
mountains
and
and
up
towns
like
the
living
rock
from
which
they
grew
a
cloudy
region
black
and
desolate
where
once
a
slave
withstood
a
world
in
arms
the
air
is
sweet
with
violets
running
wild
broken
friezes
and
fallen
capitals
sweet
as
when
tully
writing
down
his
thoughts
those
thoughts
so
precious
and
so
lately
lost
turning
to
thee
divine
philosophy
ever
at
hand
to
calm
his
troubled
soul
sailed
slowly
by
two
thousand
years
ago
for
athens
when
a
ship
if
winds
blew
from
the
paestan
gardens
slacked
her
course
on
as
he
moved
along
the
level
shore
these
temples
in
their
splendour
eminent
arcs
and
obelisks
and
domes
and
towers
reflecting
back
the
radiance
of
the
west
well
might
he
dream
of
glory
now
coiled
up
the
serpent
sleeps
within
them
the
suckles
her
young
and
as
alone
i
stand
in
this
the
nobler
pile
the
elements
of
earth
and
air
its
only
floor
and
covering
how
solemn
is
the
stillness
nothing
stirs
save
the
cicala
flitting
round
on
the
rough

the

lizard
rushing
through

up
the
fluted
shaft

short

spring

vanish
in
the
chinks
that
time
has
made
in
such
an
hour
as
this
the
sun
broad
disk
seen
at
his
setting
and
a
flood
of
light
filling
the
courts
of
these
old
sanctuaries
gigantic
shadows
broken
and
confused
athwart
the
innumerable
columns
flung
in
such
an
hour
he
came

the
mighty
genius

in

these
three
in
more
than
their
original
grandeur
and
round
about
no

upon
another
as
if
the
spoiler
had
fallen
back
in

and
turning
left
them
to
the
elements

as
seen
from
capri
a
wreath
of
light
blue
vapour
pure
and
rare
mounts
scarcely
seen
against
the
bluer
sky
in
quiet
adoration
silently
till
the
faint
currents
of
the
upper
air
dislimn
it
and
it
forms
dissolving
there
the
dome
as
of
a
palace
hung
on
high
over
the
mountain
underneath
it
lie
vineyards
and
bays
and
cities

sweet
the
memory
is
to
me
of
a
land
beyond
the
sea
where
the
waves
and
mountains
meet
where
amid
her
sits
amalfi
in
the
heat
bathing
ever
her
white
feet
in
the
tideless
summer
seas
in
the
middle
of
the
town
from
its
fountains
in
the
hills
tumbling
through

narrow
gorge

not
a

ascends
the

between
rocky

almost
meet
toiling
up
from

peasant

their

stately

tall
and
straight
what

them
to
this
life
of

lord
of
vineyards
and
of
lands
far
above
the
convent
stands
on
its
terraced
walk
aloof
leans
a
monk
with
folded
hands
placid
satisfied
serene
looking
down
upon
the
scene
over
wall
and
roof
wondering
unto
what
good
end
all
this
toil
and
traffic
tend
and
why
all
men
can
not
be
free
from
care
and
free
from
pain
and
the
sordid
love
of
gain
and
as
indolent
as
he
where
are
now
the
freighted
barks
from
the
marts
of
east
and
west
where
the
knights
in
iron
sarks
journeying
to
the
holy
land
glove
of
steel
upon
the
hand
cross
of
crimson
on
the
breast
where
the
pomp
of
camp
and
court
where
the
pilgrims
with
their
prayers
where
the
merchants
with
their
wares
and
their
gallant
brigantines
sailing
safely
into
port
chased
by
corsair
algerines
vanished
like
a
fleet
of
cloud
like
a
passing
are
those
splendours
of
the
past
and
the
commerce
and
the
crowd
fathoms
deep
beneath
the
seas
lie
the
ancient
wharves
and
quays
swallowed
by
the
engulfing
waves
silent
streets
and
vacant
halls
ruined
roofs
and
towers
and
walls
hidden
from
all
mortal
eyes
deep
the
sunken
city
lies
even
cities
have
their
graves
this
is
an
enchanted
land
round
the
headlands
far
away
sweeps
the
blue
salernian
bay
with
its
sickle
of
white
sand
further
still
and
furthermost
on
the
coast
paestum
with
its
ruins
lies
and
its
roses
all
in
bloom
seem
to
tinge
the
fatal
skies
of
that
lonely
land
of
doom
on
his
terrace
high
in
air
nothing
doth
the
good
monk
care
for
such
worldly
themes
as
these
from
the
garden
just
below
little
puffs
of
perfume
blow
and
a
sound
is
in
his
ears
of
the
murmur
of
the
bees
in
the
shining
nothing
else
he
heeds
or
hears
all
the
landscape
seems
to
swoon
in
the
happy
afternoon
slowly
his
senses
creep
the
encroaching
waves
of
sleep
and
he
sinks
as
sank
the
town
unresisting
fathoms
down
into
caverns
cool
and
deep
walled
about
with
drifts
of
snow
hearing
the
fierce
north
wind
blow
seeing
all
the
landscape
white
and
the
river
cased
in
ice
comes
this
memory
of
delight
comes
this
vision
unto
me
of
a
paradise
in
the
land
beyond
the
sea

i
thence

a

italian

cried
in
the

round
the

where
glib

the

in
a

at
the

how

from

the

of

the

the

how
that

before
the

the

multitudinous

there
a

a

of
kind

the
quick
boïte
laughs
to
and
departs
burying
his
snowy
leaps
in
pools
of
green
my
tower
that
climbs
to
see
what
can
be
seen
towards
three
crosses
or
the
high
giaù
daisies
or
where
the
great
white
highway
southward
blazes
my
sloping
barley
plots
my
hayfield
lawn
breathing
heavy
and
sweet
before
the
dawn
shows
up
her
pillared
bulwarks
one

to
the

oft
as
the
pilgrim
spirit
most
erect
dares
the
poor
dole
of

reject
the
lust
of

invades
and
fills
the

homesickness
for

phillimore
farewell
to

i
leave
thee
beauteous
italy
no
more
from
the
high

at
to
look
supine
into
thy
depths
of

thy
golden

thy
dark
spires
of
fretted
cypresses
bordering
the

of

must
be
dreams
hereafter
and
my

to
me
but
in
the

song
i
did
believe
what
have
i
not
believed
weary
with
age
but
unopprest
by
pain
to
close
in
thy
soft
clime
my
quiet
day
and
rest
my
bones
in
the
mimosa
shade
hope
hope
few
ever
cherisht
thee
so
little
few
are
the
heads
thou
hast
so
rarely
raised
but
thou
didst
promise
this
and
all
was
well
for
we
are
fond
of
thinking
where
to
lie
when
every
pulse
hath
ceast
when
the
lone
heart
can
lift
no
aspiration
reasoning
as
if
the
sight
were
unimpaired
by
death
were
unobstructed
by
the

over

still

my

towards
these
scenes
of
ancient
heathen
fame
yet
legend
hoar
and
voice
of
bard
that
came
fixing
my
restless
youth
with
its
sweet
art
and
shades
of
power
and
those
who
bore
a
part
in
the
mad
deeds
that
set
the
world
in

so
fret
my

here
ah
is
it
blame
that
from
my

the
tear
is
fain

start
nay
from
no
fount
impure
these

arise
is
but
that
sympathy
with
adam

in

reads
its

i
heard

thy

saw
thy

which
like

watch
the

dance
to

that
thou
thy

advance
forward

it

the

there

whom
i
now
survey
not
in

not
in
the
fabled
landscape
of

but
soaring
through
thy
native
sky
in
the
wild
pomp
of
mountain
majesty
what
marvel
if
i
thus
essay
to
sing
the
humblest
of
thy
pilgrims
passing
by
would
gladly
woo
thine
echoes
with
his
string
though
from
thy
heights
no
more
one
muse
will
wave
her
wing
oft
have
i
dreamed
of
thee
whose
glorious
name
who
knows
not
knows

divinest

and
now
i
view
thee
is
alas
with
shame
that
i
in
feeblest
accents
must
adore
when
i
recount
thy
worshippers
of
yore
i
tremble
and
can
only
bend
the
knee
nor
raise
my
voice
nor
vainly
dare
to
soar
but
gaze
beneath
thy
cloudy
canopy
in
silent
joy
to
think
at
last
i
look
on
thee
lord
byron
corinth
many
a
vanished
year
and
age
and
tempest
breath
and
battle
rage
have
swept
corinth
yet
she
stands
a
fortress
formed
to
freedom
hands
the
whirlwind
wrath
the
earthquake
shock
have
left
untouched
her
hoary
rock
the
keystone
of
a
land
which
still
though
fallen
looks
proudly
on
that
hill
the
landmark
to
the
double
tide
that
purpling
rolls
on
either
side
as
if
their
waters
chafed
to
meet
yet
pause
and
crouch
beneath
her
feet
but
could
the
blood
before
her
shed
since
first
timoleon
brother
bled
or
baffled
persia
despot
fled
arise
from
out
the
earth
which
drank
the
stream
of
slaughter
as
it
sank
that
sanguine
ocean
would
her
isthmus
idly
spread
below
or
could
the
bones
of
all
the
slain
who
perished
there
be
piled
again
that
rival
pyramid
would
rise
more
through
those
clear

greets
the
blithe

whose
sunny
bosom
swells
with
joy
when
we
accept
his
matted
rushes
upheaved
with
sylvan

and
blushes
a
gift
i
promise
one
i

which
thou
with

wilt
receive
the
only
proper

for
thee
of
which
no
mortal
shall
bereave
in

thy
mouldering

the
last

a

no

may
be
cities
who
refuse
to
their

the
honours
due
and
look
ungently
on
the

but
ever
shall
those
cities
rue
the
dry
unyielding
niggard
breast
offering
no
nourishment
no
rest
to
that
young
head
which
soon
shall
rise
disdainfully
in
might
and
glory
to
the

sweetly
where
caverned
dirce

do
maidens
chant
my

flapping

with
the

away
and
sweetly
sweetly

slid

from

i

saw

how
all
turned
to
him
who
spoke
you
saw
waring
truth
or
joke
in
or
were
sailing
by
triest
where
a
day
or
two
we
harboured
a
sunset
was
in
the
west
when
looking
over
the
vessel
side
one
of
our
company
espied
a
sudden
speck
to
larboard
and
as
a
flies
and
swims
at
once
so
came
the
light
craft
up
with
its
sole
lateen
sail
that
trims
and
turns
the
water
round
its
rims
dancing
as
round
a
sinking
cup
and
by
us
like
a
fish
it
curled
and
drew
itself
up
close
beside
its
great
sail
on
the
instant
furled
and
its
planks
a
shrill
voice
cried
a
neck
as
bronzed
as
a
lascar
buy
wine
of
us
you
english
brig
or
fruit
tobacco
and
cigars
a
pilot
for
you
to
triest
without
one
look
you
so
big
they
never
let
you
up
the
bay
we
natives
should
know
best
i
turned
and
just
those
fellows
way
our
captain
said
the
thieves
are
laughing
at
us
in
their
sleeves
truth
the
boy
leaned
laughing
back
and
one
by
his
side
under
the
furled
sail
soon
i
spied
with
great
grass
hat
and
kerchief
black
who
looked
up
with
his
kingly
throat
said
somewhat
while
the
other
shook
his
hair
back
from
his
eyes
to
look
their
longest
at
us
then
the
boat
i
know
not
how
turned
sharply
round
laying
her
whole
side
on
the
sea
as
a
leaping
fish
does
from
the
lee
into
the
weather
cut
somehow
her
sparkling
path
beneath
our
bow
and
so
went
off
as
with
a
bound
into
the
rosy
and
golden
half
of
the
sky
to
overtake
the
sun
and
reach
the
shore
like
the
its
singing
cave
yet
i
caught
one
glance
ere
away
the
boat
quite
passed
and
neither
time
nor
toil
could
mar
those
features
so
i
saw
the
last
of
waring
you
oh
never
star
was
lost
here
but
it
rose
afar
look
east
where
whole
new
thousands
are
in
what
avatar
browning
on
the
rhine
vain
is
the
effort
to
forget
some
day
i
shall
be
cold
i
know
as
is
the
eternal
snow
of
the
high
alps
to
which
i
go
but
ah
not
yet
not
yet
vain
is
the
agony
of
grief
is
true
indeed
an
iron
knot
ties
straitly
up
from
mine
thy
lot
and
were
it
snapt
thou
me
not
but
is
despair
relief
awhile
let
me
with
thought
have
done
and
as
this
brimmed
unwrinkled
rhine
and
that
far
purple
mountain
line
lie
sweetly
in
the
look
divine
of
the
sun
so
let
me
lie
and
calm
as
they
let
beam
upon
my
inward
view
those
eyes
of
deep
soft
lucent
hue
eyes
too
expressive
to
be
blue
too
lovely
to
be
grey
ah
quiet
all
things
feel
thy
balm
those
blue
hills
too
this
river

were
restless
once
but
long

tamed
is
their
turbulent
youthful
glow
their
joy
is

the

broadly
swells
between
the

bear
the

rich
with
blossomed

crowning

along

know
that
they
must
withered
be

yet
reject
them
not
as
such
for
i
have
cherished
them
as
dear
because
they
yet
may
meet
thine
eye
and
guide
thy
soul
to
mine
even
here
when
thou
them
drooping
nigh
and
them
gathered
by

from

to
thine
the

on

the

threw
off
the

like
the

thick
with

studded

there
wreaths

ascending
vanished
into

not
a

rose
from

at

but
i
heard
a
heart
of
iron
beating
in
the
ancient

from
their
nests
beneath
the

sang
the
swallows
wild
and
high

the

seemed
more

than

then
most
musical
and
solemn
bringing
back
the

times
with
their
strange
unearthly
changes
rang
the
melancholy
chimes
like
the
psalms
from
some
old
cloister
when
the

sing
in

once

had
passed
away

before
i
was

lo
the
shadow
of
the

crossed
the

longfellow
the
carillon
antwerp
and
bruges
at
antwerp
there
is
a
low
wall
binding
the
city
and
a
moat
beneath
that
the
wind
keeps
afloat
you
pass
the
gates
in
a
slow
drawl
of
wheels
if
it
is
warm
at
all
the

will
give
you
thought
i
climbed
the

in

church
what
time
the
urgent
weight
of
sound
at
sunset
seems
to
heave
it
round
far
up
the
carillon
did
search
the
wind
and
the
birds
came
to
perch
far
under
where
the
gables
wound
in
antwerp
harbour
on
the
scheldt
i
stood
along
a
certain
space
of
night
the
mist
was
near
my
face
deep
on
the
flow
was
heard
and
felt
the
carillon
kept
pause
and
dwelt
in
music
through
the
silent
place
at
bruges
when
you
leave
the
train
a
singing
numbness
in
your
ears
the
carillon
first
sound
appears
only
the
inner
moil
again
a
little
minute
though
your
brain
takes
quiet
and
the
whole
sense
hears
john
memmeling
and
john
van
eyck
hold
state
at
bruges
in
sore
shame
i
scanned
the
works
that
keep
their
name
the
carillon
which
then
did
strike
mine
ears
was
heard
of
theirs
alike
it
set
me
closer
unto
them
i
climbed
at
bruges
all
the
flight
the
belfry

of
ancient
stone
for
leagues
i
saw
the
east
wind
blown
the
earth
was
grey
the
sky
was
white
i
stood
so
near
upon
the
height
that
my

left
the

rossetti
holland
holland
that
scarce
deserves
the
name
of

as

the
of
the

so
much

was

what
by

the
this

of

fell
to
the
dutch
by
just
propriety
glad
then
as
miners
who
have
found
the
ore
they
with
mad
labour
fished
the
land
to
shore
and
dived
as
desperately
for
each
piece
of

as
if

been

anxiously
small

their

they
rivet

gigantic

thorough
the

their
