a
dismal
scene
late
past
and
let
that
guilty
amour
be
your

of
my
friend

gay
by

vile
arts
and
away
from
every

that
animates
this

and
the
happy

a
frowns
a
burning
tears
for
folly
much
increase
their
cares
a
brother
mourns
in
solitude
forlorn
to
hear
his
stella
meet
reproof
and
scorn
in
tears
he
cries
my
late
disgrace
will
plant
a
stigma
on
the

from
latent
vices
will
abstain
with
pious
thoughts
pass
the
day
away
till
stern
reproof
is
far
away
too
well
i
know
that
censure
will
appear
in

with
innocence
and
love
my
prayers
offer
to
the
throne
on
high
and
live
as
ordered
by
the
deity
lately
i
met
my
upper
maid
to
ask
her
questions
i
was
much
afraid
yet
ere
i
bade
the
honest
girl
adieu
nature
me
to
inquire
of
you
she
said
my
mother
fell
a
prey
to
grief
and
that
no
medicine
could
give
relief
in
stating
this
a
tear
escaped
her
eye

she
cried
then
heaved
a
tender
sigh
i
will
return
and
ere
her
spirits
fled
press
my
mother
on
her
couch
or
bed
for
sake
write
me
a
line
to
say
if
i
to
you
may
speedy
bend
my
way

boon
is
all
i
ask

late

consigned
to
the

if
penury
hung
round

door
he
would
forget
to
remember
the
poor
so
cheerful
in

you
always
would
find
neither
spleen

could
harass

him
they
would
call

i
can
say
with
truth
he
was
liked
by
us
all
good

his

would
him
much
pleasure
bring
for
no
subject

more
his
king
his
conduct
and
actions
would
plainly
foretell
as
a
husband
or
parent
but
few
did
excel
he
was
always
a
friend
to
the
labouring
poor
to
serve
them
at
all
times
no
one
could
strive
more
in
all
parish

he
was
found
to

call
them
from
earthly
troubles
may
he
pardon
them
all
the
valiant
captain
this
night
i
am
trying
a
picture
to
draw
whom
you
know
very
well
is
a
son
of
the
law
a
wonder
of
wonders
he
will
not
drive
the
quill
to
injure
another
or
make
a
bad
will
to
increase
a
dispute
he
begs
leave
to
decline
and
will
settle
such
things
a
glass
of
good
wine
when
said
we
soon
should
be
invaded
by
france
oh
dear
how
he
made
his
gay
pony
quick
dance
i
fear
be
found
he
would
be
in
the
rear
if
the
time
was
to
come
that
their
armies
were
near
and
was
they
on
shore
to
arrive
the
shock
would
be
such
that
he
could
not
survive
as
hudibras
says
he
this
notion
retain
he
that
quick
runs
away
may
perhaps
fight
again
on
sundays
he
brought
his
brave
men
to
our
view
but
some
people
say
they
no
fighting
knew
had
such
been
the
case
i
will
answer
to
say
but
those
very
brave
valiants
would
soon
run
away
give
them
plumb
pudding
and
plenty
of
beef
and
alone
on
the
ground
would
be
found
the
grand
chief
show
him
but
a
bottle
of
excellent
wine
and
warrant
to
say
the
contest
decline
if
talking
would
do
he
would
frighten
them
all
but
i
think
like
to
see
powder
or
ball
come
whistling
near
to
his
or
heart
from
such
trying
scenes
he
would
gladly
depart
as
a
neighbour
worthy
the
village

may
he
want
a

his

are
shedding
those

then
furl
up
his
sails
for
a
respite
to
mind
when
the
mishaps
of
life
to
his
bosom
gave
pain
he
would
boldly
embark
on

hereafter
more

was
a
hope
for
to
see
them
once
more

no

joys
can
impart
