used

but
now
that
i
grow
older
is
well
seen
what
tricks
ye
put
upon
me
how
many
a
summer
evening
have
ye
been
sitting
about
my
fain
to
sing
and
tell
old
tales
while
through
the
fragrant
dark
burned
the
large
planets
throbbed
the
brooding
sound
of
crickets
and
the
ceaseless
ring
and
in
the
meads
the
lit
her
spark
where
from
my
threshold
sank
the
vale
profound
blue
roses
of
academus
so
late
and
long
the
shadows
lie
under
the
quadrangle
wall
from
such
a
narrow
strip
of
sky
so
scant
an
hour
the
sunbeams
fall
they
hardly
come
to
touch
at
all
this
cool
sequestered
corner
where
beside
the
chapel
belfry
tall
i
cultivate
my
small
parterre
poor
sickly
blooms
of
academe
recluses
of
the
college
close
whose
pallor
would
beseem
the
violet
better
than
the
rose
there
not
a
bud
among
you
blows
with
scent
or
hue
to
lure
the
bee
only
the
thorn
that
on
you
grows
only
the
thorn
grows
hardily
pale
cloisterers
have
you
lost
so
soon
the
way
to
blush
do
you
forget
how
once
beneath
the
enamored
moon
you
climbed
against
the
parapet
to
touch
the
breast
of
juliet
warm
with
a
kiss
wet
with
a
tear
in
gardens
of
the
capulet
far
south
my
flowers
not
here
not
here
the
winds
of
dawn
whither
do
ye
blow
for
now
the
moon
is
low
whence
is
it
that
ye
come
and
where
is
it
ye
go
all
night
the
air
was
still
the
crickets
song
was
shrill
but
now
there
runs
a
hum
and
rustling
through
the
trees
a
breath
of
coolness
wakes
as
on
canadian
lakes
and
on
atlantic
seas
and
each
high
alpine
lawn
begin
the
winds
of
dawn
anacreontic
i
would
not
be
a
voyager
on
the
windy
seas
more
sweet
to
me
this
bank
where
crickets
chirp
and
bees
buzz
drowsy
sunshine
minstrelsies
i
would
not
bide
on
lonely
heights
where
shepherds
dwell
at
twilight
tide
the
sounds
that
from
the
valley
swell
soft
breathing
lute
and
herdsman
bell
are
sweeter
far
than
music
of
cold
mountain
rills
the
evening
star
wakes
love
and
song
below
but
chills
with
mist
and
breeze
the
gloomy
hills
i
would
not
woo
some
juno
queenly
fair
soft
eyes
of
blue
and
sudden
blushes
unaware
do
net
my
heart
in
silken
snare
i
do
not
love
the
eyrie
but
low
woodland
nest
of
cushat
dove
not
wind
but
calm
not
toil
but
rest
and
sleep
in
grassy
meadow
breast
bumble
bee
as
i
lay
yonder
in
tall
grass
a
drunken
went
past
delirious
with
honey
toddy
the
golden
sash
about
his
body
could
scarce
keep
in
his
swollen
belly
distent
with
jelly
rose
liquor
and
the
sweet
pea
wine
had
filled
his
soul
with
song
divine
deep
had
he
drunk
the
warm
night
through
his
hairy
thighs
were
wet
with
dew
full
many
an
antic
he
had
played
while
the
world
went
round
through
sleep
and
shade
oft
had
he
lit
with
thirsty
lip
some
nectared
sweets
to
sip
when
on
smooth
petals
he
would
slip
or
over
tangled
stamens
trip
and
headlong
in
the
pollen
rolled
crawl
out
quite
dusted
with
gold
or
else
his
heavy
feet
would
stumble
against
some
bud
and
down
he
tumble
amongst
the
grass
there
lie
and
grumble
in
low
soft
bass
poor
maudlin
bumble
with
tipsy
hum
on
sleepy
wing
he
buzzed
a
glee
a
bacchic
thing
which
wandering
strangely
in
the
moon
he
learned
from
grigs
that
sing
in
june
unknown
to
sober
bees
who
dwell
through
the
dark
hours
in
waxen
cell
when
south
wind
floated
him
away
the
music
of
the
summer
day
lost
something
sure
it
was
a
pain
to
miss
that
dainty
strain
water
lilies
at
sunset
mine
eyes
have
seen
when
once
at
sunset
hour
white
lily
flocks
that
edged
a
lonely
lake
all
rose
and
sank
upon
the
lifting
swell
that
swayed
their
long
stems
lazily
and
lapped
their
floating
pads
and
stirred
among
the
leaves
and
when
the
sun
from
western
gates
of
day
poured
colored
flames
they
kissed
to
ruddy
shame
so
blushed
through
snowy
petals
that
they
glowed
like
roses
in
dewy
bowers
when
lie
dark
with
early
shade
that
so
their
perfumed
chalices
were
brimmed
with
liquid
glory
till
they
overflowed
and
spilled
rich
lights
and
purple
shadows
out
that
splashed
the
pool
with
gold
and
stained
its
waves
in
tints
of
violet
and
ruby
blooms
but
when
the
flashing
gem
that
lit
the
day
dropped
in
its
far
blue
casket
of
the
hills
the
rainbow
paintings
faded
from
the
mere
the
shades
grew
black
the
gilding
dimmed
while
paling
slow
through
tender
amber
hues
the
crimsoned
lilies
blanched
to
coldest
white
and
wanly
shivered
in
the
evening
breeze
when
twilight
closed
when
earliest
fell
all
deep
down
their
golden
hearts
they
shrank
at
that
still
touch
as
maidens
shrink
when
love
first
footstep
frights
with
sweet
alarms
the
untrod
wildness
of
their
virgin
breasts
then
shut
their
ivory
cups
and
dipping
low
their
folded
beauties
in
the
gloomy
wave
they
nodded
drowsily
and
heaved
in
sleep
but
sweeter
far
than
summer
dreams
at
dawn
their
mingled
breaths
from
out
the
darkness
stole
across
the
silent
lake
the
winding
shores
the
shadowy
hills
that
rose
in
lawny
slopes
the
marsh
among
whose
reeds
the
wild
fowl
screamed
and
dusky
woodlands
where
the
night
came
down
between
the
flowers
an
open
door
and
wide
with
pillared
vines
on
either
side
and
terraced
flowers
stair
over
stair
standing
in
pots
of
earthenware
where
stiff
processions
filed
around
black
on
the
smooth
sienna
ground
tubers
and
bulbs
now
blossomed
there
which
in
the
moisty
air
lay
winter
long
in
patient
rows
glassed
snugly
in
from
christmas
snows
tuberoses
with
white
waxy
gems
in
bunches
on
their
stems
their
fragrance
forced
by
art
too
soon
to
mingle
with
the
sweets
of
june
so
breathes
the
thin
blue
smoke
that
steals
from
ashes
of
the
gilt
pastilles
burnt
slowly
as
the
brazier
swings
in
dim
saloons
of
eastern
kings
i
saw
the
calla
arching
cup
with
yellow
spadix
standing
up
its
liquid
scents
to
stir
and
mix
the
goldenest
of
roses
and
purple
fuchsia
drops
camellias
which
the
gardener
crops
to
make
the
sickening
wreaths
that
lie
on
coffins
when
our
loved
ones
die
these
all
and
many
more
were
there
monsters
and
grandifloras
rare
with
tropical
broad
leaves
grown
rank
drinking
the
waters
of
the
tank
wherein
the
bathe
all
curious
forms
of
spur
and
spathe
pitcher
and
sac
and
there
in
the
fresh
new
england
morn
but
where
the
sun
came
colored
through
translucent
petals
wet
with
dew
the
interspace
was
carpeted
with
oriel
lights
and
nodes
of
red
orange
and
blue
and
violet
that
wove
strange
figures
as
they
met
of
airier
tissue
brighter
blooms
than
tumble
from
the
persian
looms
so
at
the
pontiff
feasts
they
tell
from
the
board
edge
the
goblet
fell
spilled
from
its
throat
the
purple
tide
and
stained
the
pavement
far
and
wide
such
steps
wise
sheba
trod
upon
up
to
the
throne
of
solomon
so
bright
the
steep
which
israel
vision
scaled
in
sleep
what
one
is
she
whose
feet
shall
dare
tread
that
illuminated
stair
like
sheba
queen
like
angels
fair
oh
listen
in
the
morning
air
the
blossoms
all
are
hanging
still
the
queen
is
standing
on
the
sill
no
sheba
she
her
virgin
zone
proclaims
her
royalty
alone
such
royalty
the
lions
own
yet
all
too
cheap
the
patterned
stone
that
paves
kings
palaces
to
feel
the
pressure
of
her
gaiter
heel
the
girlish
grace
that
lit
her
face
made
sunshine
in
a
dusky
place
the
old
silk
hood
demure
and
quaint
wherein
she
seemed
an
though
in
setting
old
of
dingy
carving
and
tarnished
gold
her
eyes
the
candles
in
that
shrine
making
madonna
face
to
shine
lingering
i
passed
but
evermore
abide
with
me
the
open
door
the
doorsteps
wide
the
flowers
that
stand
in
brilliant
ranks
on
either
hand
the
two
white
pillars
and
the
vine
of
and
lush
woodbine
and
from
my
weary
paths
as
far
as
sheba
or
the
angels
are
between
upon
the
wooden
sill
thou
queen
of
hearts
art
standing
still
as
you
like
it
here
while
i
read
the
light
forsakes
the
pane
metempsychosis
of
the
twilight
gray
into
green
aisles
of
epping
or
ardenne
the
level
lines
of
print
stretch
far
away
the
whisper
like
the
a
smell
of
ancient
woods
a
breeze
of
morn
a
breath
of
violets
from
the
mossy
paths
and
hark
the
voice
of
hounds
the
royal
horn
which
muffled
in
the
ferny
coverts
deep
utters
the
three
sweet
notes
that
sound
recall
as
riding
two
by
two
between
the
oaks
come
on
the
paladins
and
ladies
all
the
court
will
rest
from
chase
in
this
smooth
glade
that
slopes
to
meet
yon
little
rushy
stream
where
in
the
shallows
nod
the
and
the
blue
banners
gleam
the
gamekeepers
are
coupling
of
the
hounds
the
pages
hang
bright
scarfs
upon
the
boughs
the
quarry
lies
upon
the
turf
whereon
but
now
he
with
the
herd
did
browse
the
silk
pavilion
shines
among
the
trees
the
mighty
pasties
and
the
flagons
strong
give
cheer
to
the
dear
heart
of
many
a
knight
and
many
a
dame
whose
beauty
lives
in
song
meanwhile
a
staging
improvised
and
rude
rises
whereon
the
masquers
and
the
mimes
play
for
their
sport
a
pleasant
interlude
fantastic
gallant
pointing
at
the
times
their
is
the
wide
midsummer
wood
down
some
gallery
the
deer
the
dappled
of
that
sylvan
show
starts
as
the
distant
ranting
strikes
his
ear
they
use
no
traverses
nor
painted
screen
to
help
along
their
naked
wit
only
the
forest
lends
its
leafy
scene
yet
wonderfully
well
they
please
the
pit
the
plaudits
echo
through
the
wide
parquet
where
the
fair
audience
upon
the
grass
each
knight
beside
his
is
set
while
overhead
the
merry
winds
do
pass
the
little
river
murmurs
in
its
reeds
and
somewhere
in
the
verdurous
solitude
the
drops
a
cool
contralto
note
an
orchestra
unto
their
mood
as
runs
the
play
so
runs
the
afternoon
the
curtain
and
the
sun
fall
side
by
side
the
epilogue
is
spoke
the
twilight
come
then
homeward
through
the
darkening
glades
they
ride
the
old
city
ancient
city
down
thy
street
minstrels
make
their
music
sweet
sound
of
bells
is
on
the
air
fountains
sing
in
every
square
where
from
dawn
to
shut
of
day
maidens
walk
and
children
play
and
at
night
when
all
are
gone
the
waters
in
the
dark
sing
on
till
the
moonrise
and
the
breeze
whiten
the
trees
cool
thou
liest
leisured
slow
on
the
plains
of
long
ago
all
unvexed
of
fretful
trades
through
thy
rich
and
dim
arcades
overlooking
lands
below
terraced
to
thy
green
plateau
dear
old
city
it
is
long
since
i
heard
thy
minstrels
song
since
i
heard
thy
deep
since
i
watched
thy
fountains
leap
yet
whichever
way
i
turn
still
i
see
the
sunset
burn
at
the
ending
of
the
street
where
the
chestnut
branches
meet
where
between
the
gay
bazaars
maidens
walk
with
eyes
like
stars
and
the
slippered
merchants
go
on
the
pavements
to
and
fro
upland
winds
blow
through
my
sleep
moonrise
glimmers
waters
leap
till
awaking
thou
dost
seem
like
a
city
of
a
dream
like
a
city
of
the
air
builded
high
aloof
and
fair
such
as
childhood
used
to
know
on
the
plains
of
long
ago
amethysts
not
the
green
eaves
of
our
young
woods
alone
shelter
new
violets
by
the
spring
rains
kissed
in
the
hard
quartz
by
some
old
april
sown
blossoms
time
flower
the
steadfast
amethyst
here
pansies
they
for
thoughts
weak
thoughts
though
fair
june
sees
their
opening
june
their
swift
decay
but
those
stone
bourgeons
stand
for
thoughts
more
rare
whose
patient
crystals
colored
day
by
day
might
i
so
cut
my
flowers
within
the
rock
and
prison
there
their
sweet
escaping
breath
their
petals
then
the
winter
frost
should
mock
and
only
time
slow
chisel
work
their
death
if
out
of
those
embedded
purple
blooms
were
quarried
cups
to
hold
the
purple
wine
greek
drinkers
thought
the
glorious
maddening
fumes
were
cooled
with
radiance
of
that
gem
divine
might
i
so
wed
the
crystal
and
the
grape
passion
red
heart
and
plastic
art
endeavor
delirium
should
take
on
immortal
shape
dancing
and
blushing
in
strong
rock
forever
katy
did
in
a
windy
sitting
singing
at
the
fall
of
dew
katy
watched
the
bats
while
the
twilight
curtains
drew
closer
round
her
till
she
only
saw
the
branches
and
the
sky
rocking
late
and
rocking
lonely
anchored
on
the
darkness
high
and
the
song
that
she
was
singing
in
the
windy
swinging
was
the
tree
under
the
fox
is
digging
a
pit
for
when
the
early
stars
were
sparkling
overhead
and
down
below
fireflies
twinkled
through
the
darkling
thickets
she
heard
footsteps
go
voice
of
her
false
lover
speaking
laughing
to
his
sweetheart
new
half
my
heart
for
thee
i
breaking
did
not
katy
love
me
true
then
no
longer
she
was
singing
but
through
all
the
wood
kept
ringing
did
katy
did
katy
did
love
the
fox
is
digging
a
grave
for
narcissus
where
the
black
hemlock
slants
athwart
the
stream
he
came
to
bathe
the
sun
pursuing
beam
laid
a
warm
hand
upon
him
as
he
stood
naked
while
noonday
silence
filled
the
wood
holding
the
boughs
with
cautious
foot
he
felt
his
way
along
the
mossy
root
that
edged
the
brimming
pool
then
paused
and
dreamed
half
like
a
dryad
of
the
tree
he
seemed
half
like
the
naiad
of
the
stream
below
suspended
there
between
the
water
flow
and
the
green
world
the
air
coaxing
with
softest
touch
his
body
fair
a
little
longer
yet
to
be
content
outside
of
its
own
crystal
element
and
he
still
lingering
at
the
brink
looked
down
and
marked
the
sunshine
fleck
with
gold
the
brown
and
sandy
floor
which
paved
that
woodland
pool
but
then
within
the
shadows
deep
and
cool
which
the
close
hemlocks
on
the
surface
made
two
eyes
met
his
yet
darker
than
that
shade
and
shining
through
the
watery
foliage
dim
two
white
and
slender
arms
reached
up
to
him
comest
thou
again
now
all
the

calls
her
narcissus
would
her
voice
were
thine
dear
speechless
image
and
could
answer
mine
her
i
but
hear
and
thee
i
may
but
see
yet
echo
thou
art
happy
unto
me
for
though
thyself
art
but
a
voice
sad
maid
thy
love
the
substance
is
and
my
love
shade
alas
for
never
may
i
kiss
those
dumb
sweet
lips
nor
ever
hope
to
come
into
that
that
lies
somewhere
somewhere
between
the
water
and
the
air
alas
for
never
shall
i
clasp
that
form
that
mocks
me
yonder
seeming
firm
and
warm
but
if
i
leap
to
its
embrace
the
cold
and
yielding
flood
is
all
my
arms
enfold
all
creatures
else
save
only
me
can
share
my
beauties
be
it
but
to
stroke
my
hair
or
hold
my
hand
in
theirs
or
hear
me
speak
the
village
wives
will
laugh
and
clap
my
cheek
the
forest
nymphs
will
beg
me
for
a
kiss
to
make
me
blush
or
hide
themselves
by
this
clear
brook
to
see
me
bathe
but
i
must
pine
loving
not
me
but
this
dear
ghost
of
mine
then
bending
down
the
boughs
until
they
dipped
their
broad
green
fronds
into
the
wave
he
slipped
and
floating
from
the
branches
hung
his
body
with
the
current
idly
swung
and
ever
and
anon
he
caught
the
gleam
of
a
white
shoulder
swimming
in
the
stream
pressed
close
to
his
and
two
young
eyes
of
black
under
the
dimpling
surface
answered
back
his
own
just
out
of
kissing
distance
then
the
vain
and
passionate
longing
came
again
still
baffled
still
renewed
he
loosed
his
hold
upon
the
boughs
and
strove
once
more
to
fold
to
his
embrace
that
fine
unbodied
shape
but
the
quick
apparition
made
escape
and
once
again
his
empty
arms
took
in
only
the
water
and
the
shadows
thin
thus
every
day
when
noon
lay
bright
and
hot
on
all
the
plains
there
came
to
this
cool
spot
under
the
hemlocks
by
the
deepening
brook
narcissus
phoebus
darling
there
to
look
and
pore
upon
his
picture
in
the
flood
till
once
a
peeping
dryad
of
the
wood
tracking
his
steps
along
the
slender
path
which
he
between
the
tree
trunks
trodden
hath
misses
the
boy
on
whom
her
amorous
eyes
where
wont
to
feed
but
where
he
stood
she
spies
a
yellow
flower
that
still
doth
seem
to
woo
his
own
pale
reflex
in
the
stream
whom
phoebus
kisses
when
the
woods
are
still
and
only
ceaseless
echo
from
the
hill
unprompted
cries
nunc
dimittis

of

by
the
blue
ocean

let
your
gray
bases
drink

thou
my

where
the

wades
through

decays
thou
my

where
leagues
of

black

of

crawls
in

be
a
lonely
land
where
stilted
men
stalking
across
the

waters
go
casting
long
shadows
and
the
creaking
slow
laden
with
its
marshy
hay
disturbs
the
stagnant
ditches
twice
a
day
thou
hast
thy
crocodiles
on
rotten
logs
afloat
the
turtles
swarm
and
bask
the
frogs
when
come
the
pale
cold
twilights
of
the

distant
through

to
take
the

its

or
kill
the
snake
or

at
night
the

with

white
i
find
upon
the

through
the

trodden
by
tramps
along

not
thine
the

of
the
salt
marsh
below
where
when
the

is
out
the
mowers
go
shearing
the
oozy
plain
that
reeks
with
brine
more
tonic
than
the
incense
of
the
pine
thou
art
the
sink
of
all
uncleanliness
a
drain
for
a
wilderness
of
trenches
pockets
quagmires
bogs
where
rank
the
poison
sumach
grows
and
in

the

five

among

found
in
yonder
pond
the

lay
drowned
and
throttled
on
the
bottom
of
this
moat
near
where
the
negro
hermit
keeps
his
boat
whose
wigwam
stands
beside
the
swamp
whose

it
furnishes
fat
pouts
and
eels
even
so
thou
hast
a
kind
of
beauty
wild
unwholesome
thou
the

child
behind
whose
grimy
skin
and
matted

warm
nature
works
and
makes

has
wrought
a

and

border
of

and

in
triple
order
of
the

and
the

in
the

tangled
the
dodder
threads
in

the

bright

like
orange
helmets
on

still
thou
hast
i

the
ways
that
to
thy

where
in
black
bogs
the
sundew
sticky
bead
ensnares
young
insects
and
that
rosy
lass
sweet
arethusa
blushes
in
the
grass
once
on
a
sunday
when
the
bells
were
still
following
the
path
under
the
sandy
hill
through
the
old
orchard
and
across
the
plank
that
bridges
the
dead
stream
past
many
a
rank
of
midway
in
the
swamp
i
found
a
small
green
mead
of
dry
but
spongy
ground
entrenched
about
on
every
side
with
sluices
full
to
the
brim
of
thick
lethean
juices
the
filterings
of
the
marsh
with
line
and
hook
two
little
french
boys
from
the
trenches
took
frogs
for
their
sunday
meal
and
gathered
messes
of
pungent
salad
from
the
a
little
isle
of
foreign
soil
it
seemed
and
listening
to
their
outland
talk
i
dreamed
that
yonder
spire
above
the
calm
rose
from
the
village
chestnuts
of
la
balme
yes
many
a
pretty
secret
hast
thou
shown
to
me
o
beaver
pond
walking
alone
on
summer
afternoons
while
yet
the
swallow
skimmed
each
flaggy
plash
and
gravelly
shallow
or
when
september
turned
the
swamps
to
gold
and
purple
but
the
year
is
growing
old
the
is
rusted
and
the
red
that
streaked
october
frosty
cheek
is
dead
only
the
sumach
garnet
pompons
make
procession
through
the
melancholy
brake
lo
even
now
the
autumnal
wind
blows
cool
over
the
rippled
waters
of
thy
pool
and
red
autumnal
sunset
colors
brood
where
i
alone
and
all
too
late
intrude
high
island
pleasant
it
was
at
shut
of
day
when
wind
and
wave
had
sunk
away
to
hear
as
on
the
rocks
we
lay
the
fog
bell
toll
and
grimly
through
the
gathering
night
the
horn
dull
blare
from
faulkner
light
snuffed
out
by
ghostly
fingers
white
that
round
it
stole
somewhere
behind
its
curtain
soon
the
mist
grew
conscious
of
a
moon
no
more
we
heard
the
diving
loon
scream
from
the
spray
but
seated
round
our
fire
watched
the
red
sparks
rise
high
and
higher
then
wandering
into
night
expire
and
pass
away
down
the
dark
wood
the
pines
among
a
lurid
glare
the
firelight
flung
so
for
a
while
we
talked
and
sung
and
then
to
sleep
and
heard
in
dreams
the
bell
as
all
night
long
in
solemn
swell
the
tidal
waters
rose
and
fell
with
soundings
deep
lotus
eating
come
up
once
more
before
mine

sweet
halcyon
days
warm
summer
sea
faint
orange
of
the
morning
skies
and
shores
upon
the
lee
touched
with
the
sunrise
sea
and
sky
all
still
on
memory
canvas
lie
the
scattered
isles
with
india
ink
dot
the
wide
gold
and
pink
unstirring
in
the
sunday
calm
their
profile
cedars
sharply
drawn
bold
black
against
the
flushing
dawn
take
shape
like
clumps
of
tropic
palm
night
shadows
still
the
distance
dim
where
ocean
brim
upholdeth
the
once
more
in
thought
we
seem
to
creep
by
lonely
reefs
where
scream
along
the
deep
borne
onward
in
the
the
spreadeth
glassy
still
no
breath
the
idle
sail
doth
fill
our
smite
the
heavy
seas
under
the
world
the
morning
breeze
treads
with
the
sun
the
unknown
ways
thus
steer
we
the
solemn
main
eating
the

dreaming
that
time
forever
stays
singing
where
absence
is
thy
sting
listening
to
hear
our
echoes
ring
through
the
far
rocks
where
sirens
sing
the
mermaid
glass
was
down
among
the
thimble
isles
that
strew
for
many
liquid
miles
the
waters
of
long
island
sound
our
yacht
lay
in
a
cove
around
the
rocky
isles
with
cedars
green
and
channels
winding
in
between
and
here
a
low
black
reef
was
spread
and
there
a
sunken
dimpled
the
surface
of
the
tide
from
one
tall
island
cliffy
side
we
heard
the
shaggy
goats
that
fed
the
gulls
wheeled
screaming
overhead
or
settled
in
a
snowy
flock
far
out
upon
the
lonely
rock
which
like
a
pillar
seemed
to
show
some
drowned
acropolis
below
meanwhile
in
the
warm
sea
about
with
many
a
plunge
and
jolly
shout
our
crew
enjoyed
their
morning
bath
the
hairy
skipper
in
his
wrath
lay
cursing
on
the
gunwale
rim
he
loved
a
dip
but
could
not
swim
so
now
and
then
with
plank
afloat
he
struggle
feebly
round
the
boat
and
the
side
climb
puffing
in
scraping
wide
areas
off
his
skin
then
lie
and
sun
each
hirsute
limb
once
more
upon
the
gunwale
rim
and
shout
with
curses
unavailing
come
out
there
wind
let
do
some
sailing
a
hat
that
here
and
there
bobbed
on
the
water
showed
him
where
some
venturous
swimmer
outward
bound
escaped
beyond
his
voice
sound
all
heedless
of
their
skipper
call
one
group
fought
for
the
upset
yawl
the
conqueror
sat
astride
the
keel
and
deftly
pounded
with
his
heel
the
hands
that
clutched
his
citadel
which
showed
at
distance
like
the
shell
round
which
unseen
the
naiad
train
sport
naked
on
the
middle
main
myself
had
drifted
far
away
meanwhile
from
where
the
lay
till
all
unbroken
i
could
hear
the
wave
low
whisper
in
my
ear
and
at
the
level
of
mine
eye
the
blue
vibration
met
the
sky
sometimes
upon
my
back
i
lay
and
watched
the
clouds
while
i
and
they
were
wafted
effortless
sudden
i
seemed
to
hear
a
song
yet
not
a
song
but
some
weird
strain
as
though
the
inarticulate
main
had
found
a
voice
whose
human
tone
interpreted
its
own
dull
moan
its
foamy
hiss
its
surfy
roar
its
gentle
lapping
on
the
shore
its
noise
of
subterranean
waves
that
grumble
in
the
caves
its
whish
among
the
drifting
miles
of
from
the
indian
isles
all
all
the
harmonies
were
there
which
ocean
makes
with
earth
or
air
turning
i
saw
a
sunken
ledge
bared
by
the
ebb
along
whose
edge
the
matted
dripped
thereon
betwixt
the
dazzle
of
the
sun
and
the
blue
shimmer
of
the
sea
i
saw
or
else
i
seemed
to
see
a
mermaid
crooning
a
wild
song
combing
with
arm
uplifted
long
the
hair
that
shed
its
meshes
black
down
the
slope
whiteness
of
her
back
she
held
a
mirror
in
her
hand
wherein
she
viewed
sky
sea
and
land
her
beauty
background
and
its
frame
but
now
as
toward
the
rock
i
came
all
suddenly
across
the
glass
some
startling
image
seemed
to
pass
for
her
song
rose
into
a
scream
over
her
shoulders
one
swift
gleam
of
eyes
unearthly
fell
on
me
and
the
flashing
of
the
sea
and
the
blind
dazzle
of
the
sun
i
saw
the
rock
but
thereupon
she
sat
no
longer
the
blue
only
across
the
reef
there
flew
one
tern
and
vanished
too
but
coasting
that
lone
island
round
among
the
slippery
kelp
i
found
a
little
oval
glass
that
lay
upturned
and
flashing
in
the
ray
of
the
sun
thereto
with
scarce
believing
eyes
i
drew
and
took
it
captive
a
while
there
i
rested
in
the
mermaid
lair
and
felt
the
merry
breeze
that
blew
and
watched
the
sharpies
as
they
flew
and
snuffed
the
sea
breath
thick
with
brine
and
basked
me
in
the
sun
warm
shine
then
with
my
prize
i
made
my
way
once
more
to
where
the
lay
i
kept
the
secret
and
the
glass
by
day
across
its
surface
pass
the
transient
shapes
of
common
things
which
chance
within
its
oval
brings
but
when
at
night
i
strive
to
sound
the
darkness
of
its
face
profound
again
i
seem
to
hear
the
breeze
that
curls
the
waves
on
summer
seas
i
see
the
isles
with
cedars
green
the
channels
winding
in
between
the
coves
with
beaches
of
white
sand
the
reefs
where
warning
spindles
stand
and
through
the
multitudinous
shimmer
of
waves
and
sun
again
the
glimmer
of
eyes
unearthly
falls
on
me
deep
with
the
mystery
of
the
sea
a
holiday

frozen
dumb
the
dreary
flats
were
overspread
with
snow
the
college
bell
began
to
ring
and
as
the
north
wind
blew
its
distant
janglings
out
to
sea
i
thought
dear
friend
of
you
and
how
one
warm
september
day
while
yet
the
woods
were
green
we
strayed
across
the
happy
hills
and
this
wide
marsh
between
the
dotted
here
and
there
the
wide
the
even
lines
of
sluices
black
were
filling
with
the
tide
then
this
salt
stream
now
winter
bound
fled
softly
through
the
sedge
retreating
from
the
sparkling
sound
and
there
along
its
edge
we
strolled
and
marked
the
sloops
and
watched
the
cattle
graze
the
swallows
rushed
in
troops
while
bright
with
purple
haze
west
rock
looked
down
the
winding
plain
ah
this
was
long
ago
the
summer
gone
and
you
are
gone
as
everything
must
go
amours
passagères
light
loves
and
soon
forgotten
hates
of
the
brooding
summer
sky
ye
too
bred
of
the
summer
heat
ye
too
like
summer
fleet
ye
have
gone
by
walks
in
the
woods
and
whispers
over
gates
gay
rivalries
of
tennis
and
croquet
gone
with
the
summer
sweet
gone
with
the
swallow
fleet
southward
away
breath
of
the
rose
laughter
of
maids
kissed
into
silence
by
the
setting
moon
wind
of
the
morn
that
wakes
and
blows
and
hastening
night
that
goes
too
soon
too
soon
meetings
and
partings

idle
tears
and
coy
denials

the
summer

will
your
leaves
unclose
ever
again
on
a
miniature
thine
eyes

one
a

as
the
baby
rose
that
is
thy
mouth

our
eyes
not
met
in
childhood
in
a
garden
of
the
south
thy
lips
are
trembling
with
a
song
of
france
my
cousin
and
thine
eyes
are
dimly
sweet
with
reading
in
an
old
romance
all
afternoon
upon
the
garden
seat
the
summer
wind
read
with
thee
and
the
bees
that
on
the
sunny
pages
loved
to
crawl
a
skipping
reader
was
the
impatient
breeze
and
turned
the
leaves
but
the
slow
bees
read
all
and
now
thy
foot
descends
the
terrace
stair
i
hear
the
rustle
of
thy
silk
attire
i
breathe
the
musky
odors
of
thy
hair
and
airs
that
from
thy
painted
fan
respire
idly
thou
pausest
in
the
shady
walk

attentive
to
the
fountain

her
stalk
the
speckled
vergalieus

on
the

thou
hast
the
feature
of
my
mother
race
the
gilded
comb
she
wore
her
smile
her
eye
the
blood
that
flushes
softly
in
thy
face
crawls
through
my
veins
beneath
this
northern
sky
as
one
disherited
though
next
of
kin
who
lingers
at
the
barred
ancestral
gate
and
sadly
sees
the
happy
heir
within

careless
through
his
forfeited
estate

so

watch
thy

the

his

up

that

it
shone
from
very
far
away
through

he
journeyed
on

his

so
they
called
him
the

had
filled
his
careless
eye
a

ere
he
turned

passed
nor

was
his
destiny

ever
in
his
dreams
it
came

and
passionless
and
strong

smile
upon
the
imperial
lips
no
lover
kiss
had
dared
to
wrong
he
took
his
armor
from
the

ah
gone
since
then
was
many
a
day
he
led
his
steed
from
out
the

sought

through

blooms
upon

another

spring
than
that
wherein
the
gaudy
rose
of

the

hold
such
royal

through

in

he
found

only
i
know
that
in
the
south
long
to
the
harp
his
tale
was
told
sweet
as
new
wine
within
the
mouth
the
small
choice
words
and
music
old
to
scorn
the
promise
of
the
real

one
lost
chamber
of
the
wood
where
those
shy
mysteries
hide
one
yet
unfound
receding
depth
from
which
the
sings
still
luring
in
to
darker
shades
in
in
to
colder
springs
there
is
no
wind
abroad
but
hark
the
roar
that
sleep
and
in
their
dreams
repeat
the
music
of
the
shore
what
wisdom
in
their
needles
stirs
what
song
is
that
they
sing
those
airs
that
search
the

what
rumor

they
bring
a
hushed
excitement
fills
the
gloom

in
the

the

is
near

in

toward

subtler
than

yet
all
opaque
the
screen
which
shuts
us
from
that
world
outspread
between
the
shows
of
sense
like
as
an
ether
thin
fills
the
vast
microscopic
space
wherein
the
molecules
of
matter
lie
enisled
a
world
whose
sound
our
silence
is
too
wild
its
elfin
music
beats
too
shrill
too
rare
to
stir
the
slow
pulse
of
our
thicker
air
a
world
whose
light
our
darkness
is
that
lies
with
its
sharp
edges
turned
toward
mortal
eyes
like
figures
painted
on
a
folded
fan
the
broken
colors
of
some
hidden
plan
the
few
who
but
an
instant
look
have
had
at
the
spread
pattern
broadwise
have
gone
mad
as
in
a
oriental
street
a
sudden
door
flies
open
and
a
fleet
departing
dream
the
thirsty
traveler
sees
of
fountains
leaping
in
the
shade
of
trees
so
they
who
once
have
caught
the
glimpse
divine
they
have
but
wet
their
lips
with
goblins
wine
and
plagued
with
thirst
immortal
must
endure
the
visions
of
the
heavenly
calenture
of
springs
and
dewy
evening
meadows
rave
while
hotly
round
them
shines
the
tropic
wave
and
the
false
islands
of
mirage
appear
uplifted
from
some
transcendental
sphere
far
down
below
the
blue
horizon
line
and
thirst
like
theirs
is
nursed
by
songs
like
thine
for
thou
in
some
crepscular
dim
hour
when
the
weak
umber
moon
had
hardly
power
to
cast
a
shadow
and
a
wind
creeping
among
the
bushes
went
hast
seen
a
cobweb
spun
across
the
moon
a
faint
eclipse
penumbral
gone
full
soon
yet
marking
on
the
planet
smoky
ring
a
silhouette
as
of
a
living
thing
or
on
the
beach
making
thy
lonely
range
close
upon
sunset
when
the
light
was
strange
and
the
low
wind
had
meanings
thou
hast
known
a
presence
nigh
betrayed
by
shadows
thrown
on
the
red
sand
from
bodies
out
of
sight
even
as
by
the
shell
of
curving
light
pared
from
the
dark
moon
edge
the
eye
can
tell
where
her
full
circle
rounds
invisible
teach
me
the
path
into
that
silent
land
take
once
again
the
haunted
wires
in
hand
and
pour
the
strain
which
waking
thou
hast
heard
whistled
when
night
was
deep
by
some
lone
bird
hid
in
the
dark
and
dewy
sycamore
when
thou
hast
risen
and
unbarred
the
door
and
walked
the
garden
paths
till
night
was
flown
listening
the
message
sent
to
thee
alone
ah
once
again
thy
harp
thy
voice
once
more
fling
back
the
refluent
tide
upon
the
shore
all
nature
grows
unearthly
all
things
seem
to
break
and
waver
off
in
shapes
of
dream
and
through
the
chinks
of
matter
steals
the
dawn
of
skies
beyond
the
solar
road
withdrawn
oh
flood
my
soul
with
that
pure
it
is
the
sense
that
shut
the
heart
that
dead
all
open
still
the
world
of
spirits
lies
would
we
but
bathe
us
in
its
red
sunrise
the
ideas
of
the
pure
reason
i
saw
in
dreams
a
constellation
strange
thwarting
the
night
its
big
stars
seemed
to
range
northward
across
the
zenith
and
to
keep
calm
footing
along
heaven
high
while
round
the
pole
the
sullen
bear
did
creep
and
dizzily
the
wheeling
spheres
went
by
they
from
their
in
the
topmost
sky
looked
down
upon
the
rest
nor
eastward
swerved
nor
west
though
procyon
candle
dipped
below
the
verge
and
the
great
twins
of
leda
decline
toward
the
horizon
line
and
prone
orion
sprawling
headlong
urge
his
flight
into
the
far
pacific
surge
i
heard
a
voice
which
said
those
wonders
bright
are
hung
not
on
the
hinges
of
the
night
but
set
to
vaster
harmonies
they
run
straight
on
and
turn
not
with
the
turning
sphere
nor
make
an
orbit
about
any
sun
no
glass
can
track
the
courses
that
they
steer
by
what
dark
paths
they
vanish
and
appear
the
starry
flocks
that
still
are
climbing
heaven
hill
will
pasture
westward
down
its
sloping
lawn
but
yon
wild
herd
of
planets
who
can
say
through
what
far
fields
they
stray
around
what
focus
their
ellipse
is
drawn
whose
shining
makes
their
transcendental
dawn
i
told
my
vision
to
a
learned
man
who
said
on
no
celestial
globe
or
plan
can
those
unset
unrisen
stars
be
found
how
might
such
uncomputed
motions
be
among
the
ordered
spheres
heaven
clock
is
wound
to
keep
one
time
idle
our
dreams
and
we
blown
by
the
wind
as
the
light
family
of
leaves
but
still
i
dream
and
still
those
planets
seem
through
heaven
their
high
unbending
course
to
take
and
a
voice
cries
freedom
and
truth
are
we
and
immortality
god
is
our
sun
and
though
the
morning
break
across
my
soul
still
plays
their
shimmering
wake
on
guard
churl
drunk
all
and
left
no
friendly
help
me
romeo
and
he
has
chosen
the
death
that
is
easy
and
left
me
the
life
that
is
hard
he
has
emptied
the
cup
to
the
lees
he
has
left
me
alone
to
keep
guard
remains
not
a
drop
in
the
beaker
of
the
cordial
he
quaffed
the
strong
has
forsaken
his
weaker
and
stolen
his
anodyne
draught
the
cause
that
he
taught
me
to
cherish
the
weapons
he
trained
me
to
wield
he
has
given
it
over
to
perish
and
thrown
down
the
sword
and
the
shield
o
how
shall
the
coward
persever
when
the
hero
slinks
out
of
the
fight
or
weakness
keep
up
the
endeavor
abandoned
by
desperate
might
the
hour
of
stern
trial
has
found
me
the
sentinel
fires
are
burnt
low
and
i
hear
in
the
shadows
around
me
the
stealthy
approach
of
the
foe
be
it
so
then
my
master
my
leader
these
helpless
ones
dear
to
you
these
will
i
fend
while
i
may
though
i
bleed
or
am
beaten
with
blows
to
my
knees
lo
here
where
your
body
lies
fallen
i
draw
from
its
scabbard
the
sword
and
raise
it
how
feebly
and
call
on
your
spirit
my
captain
my
lord
the
is
sunken
to
embers
with
signals
the
darkness
is
starred
let
them
come
there
is
one
who
remembers
there
is
one
who
will
stand
upon
guard
sursum
corda
take
courage
heart
why
dost
thou
faint
and
falter
why
is
thy
light
turned
darkness
ere
the
noon
the
wind
blows
west
no
clouds
the
heaven
alter
night
comes
not
yet
with
night
too
comes
the
moon
alas
alas
the
dewy
morwing
weather
the
tender
light
that
on
the
meadows
lay
when
youth
and
hope
and
i
set
out
together
light
youth
false
hope
that
left
me
on
the
way
take
courage
yet
thou
are
not
unattended
see
love
and
peace
keep
step
on
either
hand
how
green
the
vales
the
sky
how
blue
how
splendid
the
strong
white
sunshine
sleeps
across
the
land
alas
the
thrushes
song
hath
long
had
ending
i
heard
at
dawn
among
the
pine
woods
cool
the
brook
is
still
whose
rocky
stair
descending
i
drank
at
sunrise
from
each
rosy
pool
the
noon
is
still
the
songs
of
dawn
are
over
yet
turn
not
back
to
prove
thy
memories
vain
the
mist
upon
the
hills
canst
thou
recover
or
bring
to
eastern
skies
the
bloom
again
but
courage
still
without
return
or
swerving
across
the
globe
huge
shadow
keep
the
track
till
unperceived
the
slow
meridian
curving
that
leads
thee
onward
yet
shall
lead
thee
back
to
stand
again
with
daybreak
on
the
mountains
and
where
the
paths
of
night
and
morning
meet
to
drink
once
more
of
youth
forgotten
fountains
when
thou
hast
put
the
world
between
thy
feet
love
death
and
life
the
warm
wind
comes
in
rushes
the
night
is
thick
and
sweet
i
can
not
see
the
bushes
the
tall
syringa
bushes
above
the
gate
that
meet
whose
fallen
blooms
she
crushes
under
her
heedless
feet
but
their
heavy
rich
perfume
is
round
us
in
the
gloom
which
lends
its
friendly
cover
to
bashful
maid
and
lover
which
cheats
me
of
her
blushes
but
makes
her
kiss
complete
down
the
village
street
a
lantern
swings
and
dances
in
front
of
the
old
church
porch
and
throws
its
telltale
glances
on
the
puddles
and
the
plashes
and
flares
in
the
wind
like
a
torch
and
scatters
sudden
flashes
on
the
elm
leaves
overhead
but
you
need
have
no
dread
of
that
harmless
spark
for
the
night
is
thick
and
dark
o
the
dark
is
thick
and
sweet
so
closer
let
the
beat
of
your
heart
encounter
mine
how
you
tremble
like
a
leaf
o
you
do
not
need
to
fear
any
shame
or
any
grief
while
my
arms
around
you
twine
and
the
night
wind
pours
its
wine
come
nearer
still
more
near
press
closer
closer
yet
your
cheeks
are
warm
and
wet
like
this
wind
from
out
the
south
and
warm
and
wet
your
mouth
and
yon
lantern
wo
discover
the
maiden
and
her
lover
is
only
the
sexton
nothing
more
there
was
a
funeral
the
sexton
locking
the
church
door
locking
it
up
and
going
away
why
should
it
fall
on
a
day
like
this
what
has
death
to
do
in
a
world
of
bliss
o
passionate
black
night
o
rush
of
the
southern
breeze
laden
with
blossoms
and
rain
asserter
of
life
and
its
right
cherisher
breeder
of
things
swelling
the
sap
in
the
trees
swelling
the
blood
in
the
vein
filling
the
rivers
and
springs
whisper
the
girl
at
my
side
quicken
her
pulse
with
thy
breath
teach
her
the
way
of
a
bride
teach
her
to
take
and
to
give
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
us
death
by
god
we
live
the
dying
pantheist
to
the
priest
take
your
ivory
christ
away
no
dying
god
shall
have
my
knee
while
live
gods
breathe
in
this
wild
wind
and
shout
from
yonder
dashing
sea
when
march
brings
back
the
adonis
flower
no
more
the
white
processions
meet
with
incense
to
the
risen
lord
about
the
pillared
temple
feet
from
tusk
of
boar
from
thrust
of
spear
the
dead
rise
not
at
eastertide
the
same
sun
dances
on
their
graves
love
darling
and
the
crucified
yet
still
the
year
returning
tide
flows
greenly
round
each
ruined
plinth
breaking
on
fallen
shafts
in
foam
of
crocus
and
of
hyacinth
tossing
a
spray
of
swallows
high
to
flutter
lightly
on
the
breeze
and
fleck
with
tiny
spots
of
shade
the
sunshine
on
the
broken
frieze
i
know
the
asphodels
still
sheet
the
dim
elysian
mead
and
ever
by
dark
lethe
wells
the
poppy
sheds
her
ghostly
seed
and
once
o
once
when
sunset
lay
blood
red
across
the
winter
sea
where
on
the
sands
we
drained
our
flasks
and
danced
and
cried
our
among
the
tossing
cakes
of
ice
and
spouting
of
the
frozen
spray
we
saw
their
white
limbs
twist
and
whirl
the
ancient
at
their
play
the
liquor
burned
my
heart
the
icy
tempest
stung
my
brow
the
twanging
of
apollo
lyre
i
heard
it
as
i
hear
it
now
o
no
the
old
gods
are
not
dead
i
think
that
they
will
never
die
but
i
who
lie
upon
this
bed
in
mortal
anguish
what
am
i
a
wave
that
rises
with
a
breath
above
the
infinite
watery
plain
to
foam
and
sparkle
in
the
sun
a
moment
ere
it
sink
again
the
eternal
undulation
runs
a
man
i
die
perchance
to
be
next
life
a
on
the
wind
a
daffodil
on
tempe
lea
they
lied
who
said
that
pan
was
dead
life
was
life
is
and
life
shall
be
so
take
away
your
crucifix
the
everliving
gods
for
me
the
upland
we
often
go
across
the
pleasant
land
in
summer
through
the
pine
woods
dark
or
by
the
ocean
strand
but
when
the
orchards
blossom
and
when
the
apples
fall
we
seek
the
high
hill
country
that
props
the
mountain
wall
old
farms
with
mossed
stone
fences
old
grassy
roads
that
wind
forever
on
and
upward
to
higher
fields
behind
by
ancient
pastures
bestrewn
with
boulders
gray
and
lonely
meadow
slopes
that
bear
thin
crops
of
upland
hay
as
terrace
over
terrace
we
climb
the
mountain
stair
more
solitary
grow
the
ways
more
wild
the
farms
and
rare
and
slenderer
in
their
rocky
beds
the
singing
brooks
that
go
to
the
valley
stream
a
thousand
feet
below
above
us
and
above
us
still
the
grim
escarpments
rise
till
homeward
we
must
turn
at
last
or
ere
the
daylight
dies
and
leave
unscaled
the
summit
height
the
even
ridge
where
smolder
through
the
cedar
screen
the
sunset
embers
red
what
should
we
see
if
once
we
won
on
that
top
step
to
stand
a
wondrous
valley
world
beyond
a
tableland
almost
it
seems
as
though
there
lay
the
threshold
of
the
sky
and
that
the
foot
which
crossed
that
sill
would
enter
heaven
thereby
and
when
dear
heart
the
years
have
left
us
once
again
alone
and
from
our
empty
nest
the
broods
have
scattered
forth
and
flown
shall
we
not
have
the
old
horse
round
and
take
the
track
into
the
high
hill
country
and
never
more
come
back
the
remainder
now
faith
is
dead
and
hope
is
deadly
sick
and
joy
dear
joy
she
died
so
long
ago
i
have
forgot
her
face
but
these
are
quick
black
care
and
stinging
shame
and
bitter
woe
then
what
is
left
in
my
pandora
chest
courage
is
left
but
mated
with
despair
who
should
have
wed
with
hope
yet
be
ye
blest
rise
up
and
take
your
blessing
happy
pair
i
lay
in
thine
sad
bride
this
princely
hand
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
nobler
name
and
thou
brave
groom
though
is
not
what
we
planned
take
her
she
will
be
true
be
thou
the
same
courage
and
sorrow
might
these
two
give
birth
o
thought
too
bold
o
dream
too
sweet
too
wild
though
joy
dear
joy
be
dead
and
cold
in
earth
her
ghost
is
peace
and
love
is
sorrow
child
the
pasture
bars
the
hunted
stag
now
nearly
spent
turns
homeward
to
his
lair
the
wounded
bedouin
seeks
his
tent
and
finds
safe
shelter
there
so
life
returns
upon
its
track
we
toil
we
fight
we
roam
till
the
long
shadows
point
us
back
and
evening
brings
us
home
beside
the
pasture
bars
i
heard
the
whippoorwill
while
one
by
one
the
early
stars
came
out
above
the
hill
i
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
spring
i
heard
the
cattle
pass
slow
through
the
dusk
and
lingering
to
crop
the
wayside
grass
o
weary
world
of
fret
and
strife
o
noisy
years
and
vain
what
have
you
paid
me
for
my
life
since
last
along
this
lane
a
barefoot
boy
i
drove
the
cows
in
summer
twilights
still
and
paused
beneath
the
orchard
boughs
to
list
the
whippoorwill
come
peace
of
god
that
passeth
all
our
understanding
sight
fall
on
me
with
the
dews
that
fall
and
with
the
falling
night
among
these
native
hills
and
plains
by
these
baptismal
streams
wash
off
the
city
fever
stains
bring
back
my
boyhood
dreams
beside
the
doors
where
life
began
here
let
it
find
its
close
and
be
its
brief
remaining
span
all
given
to
repose
the
rising
of
the
curtain
we
sit
before
the
curtain
and
we
heed
the
pleasant
bustle
the
ushers
hastening
up
the
aisles
the
fans
and
programmes
rustle
the
boy
that
cries
librettos
and
the
soft
incessant
sound
of
talking
and
low
laughter
that
buzzes
all
around
how
very
old
the
looks
a
thousand
times
before
i
seen
that
blue
paint
dashing
on
that
red
distemper
shore
the
castle
and
the
guazzo
sky
the
very
they
have
been
there
a
thousand
years
a
thousand
more
shall
be
all
our
lives
we
have
been
waiting
for
that
weary
daub
to
rise
we
have
peeped
behind
its
edges
as
if
we
were
god
spies
we
have
listened
for
the
signal
yet
still
as
in
our
youth
the
colored
screen
of
matter
hangs
between
us
and
the
truth
when
in
my
careless
childhood
i
dwelt
beside
a
wood
i
tired
of
the
clearing
where
my
father
cabin
stood
and
of
the
wild
young
forest
paths
that
coaxed
me
to
explore
then
dwindled
down
or
led
me
back
to
where
i
stood
before
but
through
the
woods
before
our
door
a
wagon
track
went
by
above
whose
utmost
western
edge
there
hung
an
open
sky
and
there
it
seemed
to
make
a
plunge
or
break
off
suddenly
as
though
beneath
that
open
sky
it
met
the
open
sea
oh
often
have
i
fancied
in
the
sunset
dreamy
glow
that
mine
eyes
had
caught
the
welter
of
the
ocean
waves
below
and
the
wind
among
the
with
its
low
and
ceaseless
roar
was
but
an
echo
from
the
surf
on
that
imagined
shore
alas
as
i
grew
older
i
found
that
road
led
down
to
no
more
fair
horizon
than
the
squalid
factory
town
so
all
life
purple
distances
when
nearer
them
i
came
have
played
me
still
the
same
old
cheat
the
same
the
same
the
same
and
when
o
king
the
heaven
departeth
as
a
scroll
wilt
thou
once
more
the
promise
break
thou
madest
to
my
soul
shall
i
see
thy
feasting
presence
thronged
with
baron
knight
and
page
or
will
the
curtain
rise
upon
a
dark
and
empty
stage
for
lo
quick
undulations
across
the
canvas
run
the
brighten
suddenly
the
orchestra
has
done
and
through
the
expectant
silence
rings
loud
the
prompter
bell
the
curtain
shakes
it
rises
farewell
dull
world
farewell
