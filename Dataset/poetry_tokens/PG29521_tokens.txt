preface
when
empires
lay
riven
apart
fared
goethe
at
battle
time
thunder
to
fragrant
oases
of
art
to
weave
his
into
wonder
leaving
shakespeare
he
pondered
the
note
of
nisami
and
heard
in
his
leisure
the
hoopoe
weird
monody
float
and
set
it
to
soft
orient
measure
as
goethe
at
weimar
delayed
and
dreamed
in
the
fair
garden
closes
and
questing
in
sun
or
in
shade
with
hafiz
plucked
redolent
roses
i
closed
from
the
tempest
that
shook
my
window
with
fury
impassioned
sat
dreaming
and
safe
in
my
nook
enamels
and
cameos
fashioned
affinity
a
pantheistic
madrigal
on
an
ancient
temple
gleaming
two
great
blocks
of
marble
high
thrice
a
thousand
years
lay
dreaming
dreams
against
an
attic
sky
set
within
one
silver
whiteness
two
for
venus
shed
two
fair
pearls
of
orient
brightness
through
the
waste
of
water
sped
in
the
generalife
fresh
closes
by
a
moorish
light
illumed
two
delicious
tender
roses
by
a
fountain
met
and
bloomed
in
the
balm
of
may
bright
weather
where
the
domes
of
venice
rise
lighted
on
love
nest
together
two
pale
doves
from
azure
skies
all
things
vanish
into
wonder

shall
fade
and

flee
not
a
smallest
part
but
lowly
through
the
crucible
must
pass
where
all
shapes
are
molten
slowly
in
the
universal
mass
then
as
gradual
time
discloses
marbles
melt
to
whitest
skin
roses
red
to
lips
of
roses
and
anew
the
lives
begin
and
again
the
doves
are
plighted
in
the
hearts
of
lovers
while
ocean
pearls
are
reunited
set
within
a
coral
smile
thus
affinity
comes
welling
by
its
beauty
everywhere
soul
a
foretelling
all
awakened
and
aware
quickened
by
a
zephyr
sunny
or
a
perfume
subtlewise
as
the
bee
unto
the
honey
atom
unto

flies
and
remembered
are
the
hours
in
the
temple
down
the
blue
and
the
talks
amid
the
flowers
near
the
fount
of
crystal
dew
kisses
warm
and
on
the
royal
golden
domes
the
wings
that
beat
for
the
atoms
all
are
loyal
and
again
must
love
and
greet
love
forgotten
wakes
imperious
for
the
past
is
never
dead
and
the
rose
with
joy
delirious
breathes
again
from
lips
of
red
marble
on
the
flesh
of
maiden
feels
its
own
white
bloom
and
faint
knows
the
dove
a
murmur
laden
with
the
echo
of
its
plaint
till
resistance
giveth
over
and
the
barriers
fall
undone
and
the
stranger
is
the
lover

the
poem
of
woman
marble
of
paros
unto
the
dreamer
once
whose
heart
she
had
as
she
was
showing
forth
her
treasures
rare
minded
she
was
to
read
a
poem
fair
the
poem
of
her
form
with
beauty
glad
first
stately
and
superb
she
swept
before
his
gazing
eyes
with
high
infanta
mien
trailing
behind
her
all
the
splendid
sheen
of
nacarat
floods
of
velvet
that
she
wore
thus
at
the
opera
had
he
watched
her
bend
from
out
her
box
her
body
one
bright
flame
when
all
the
air
was
ringing
with
her
name
and
every
song
made
her
fair
praise
ascend
then
had
her
art
another
way
for
look
the
weighty
velvet
dropped
and
in
its
place
a
pale
and
cloudy
fabric
proved
the
grace
of
every
line
her
glowing
body
took
till
softly
from
her
shoulder
the
veil
diaphanous
fell
the
folds
whereof
came
fluttering
downward
like
a
snowy
dove
to
nestle
in
the
wonder
of
her
feet
she
posed
as
for
apelles
pridefully
a
lovely
flesh
and
marble
womanhood
anadyomene
she
upright
stood
naked
upon
the
margent
of
the
sea
fairer
than
any
crystalline
great
pearls
of
venice
lay
upon
her
breast
jewels
of
milky
wonder
lightly
pressed
upon
the
cool
fresh
satin
of
her
skin
exhaustless
as
the
waves
that
kiss
the
brim
under
the
gleaming
moon
of
many
moods
were
all
the
strophes
of
her
attitudes
what
fascination
sang
her
beauty
hymn
but
soon
grown
weary
of
an
art
antique
of
phidias
and
of
venus
lo
again
within
another
new
and
plastic
strain
she
grouped
her
charms
unveiled
and
unique
upon
a
cashmere
opulently
spread
sultana
of
seraglio
then
she
lay
laughing
unto
her
little
mirror
gay
that
laughed
again
with
lips
of
coral
red
the
indolent
soft
georgian
posturing
with
her
long
supple
narghile
at
lip
showing
the
glorious
fashion
of
her
hip
one
foot
upon
the
other
languishing
and
like
to
ingres
odalisque
supine
defying
prurient
modesty
turned
she
displaying
in
her
beauty
candidly
wonder
of
curve
and
purity
of
line
but
hence
thou
idle
odalisque
for
life
hath
now
its
own
fair
picture
to
display
the
diamond
in
its
rare
effulgent
ray
beauty
in
love
hath
reached
its
blossom
rife
she
sways
her
body
bendeth
back
her
head
her
breathing
comes
more
subtle
and
more
fast
rocked
in
her
dream
alluring
arms
at
last
down
hath
she
fallen
upon
her
costly
bed
her
eyelids
beat
like
fluttering
pinions
lit
upon
the
darkened
silver
of
her
eyes
her
bright
voluptuous
glances
upward
rise
into
the
vague
and
nacreous
infinite
deck
her
with
sweet
lush
violets
instead
of
with
their
every
pearl
a
tear
scatter
their
purple
clusters
on
her
bier
who
of
her
being
ecstasy
lies
dead
and
bear
her
very
gently
to
her
tomb
her
bed
of
white
there
let
the
poet
stay
long
hours
upon
his
bended
knees
to
pray
when
night
shall
close
around
the
funeral
room
a
study
of
hands
i
imperia
a
sculptor
showed
to
me
one
day
a
hand
a
cleopatra
lure
or
an
aspasia
cast
in
clay
of
masterwork
a
fragment
pure
seized
in
a
snowy
kiss
and
fair
as
lily
in
the
argent
rise
of
dawn
like
whitest
poem
there
its
beauty
lay
before
mine
eyes
bright
in
its
pallor
lustreless
reposing
on
a
velvet
bed
its
fingers
weighted
with
their
dress
of
jewels
delicately
spread
a
little
parted
lay
the
thumb
showing
the
undulating
line
beautiful
graceful
subtlesome
of
its
proud
contour
florentine
strange
hand
i
wonder
if
it
toyed
in
silken
locks
of
don
juan
or
on
a
caftan
joyed
to
stroke
the
beard
of
some
soldan
whether
as
courtesan
or
queen
within
its
fingers
fair
and
slight
was
pleasure
gilded
sceptre
seen
or
sceptre
of
a
royal
might
but
sweet
and
firm
it
must
have
lain
full
oft
its
touch
of
power
rare
upon
the
curling
of
some
chimera
caught
in
air
imperial
idle
fantasy
and
love
of
soft
luxurious
things
frenzies
of
passion
wondrous
free
impossible
romances
wild
and
poesy
of
hasheech
and
of
wine
vain
speeds
beneath
bohemia
brilliant
sky
on
unrestrained
and
maddened
steeds
all
these
were
in
the
lines
of
it
of
that
white
book
with
magic
scrolled
where
ciphers
stood

behold

soaked
in
a
powerful
essence

near

a

a
morbid
fancy
win
i
touched
despite
my
loathing

the
cold
slimy
skin
not

washed
clean
of
deathly
stain
yellow
uncanny
mummified

to

it
lay

stretched
its
fingers
wide
crisp
with
temptation
awful
play
as
though
an
itch
for
flesh
and
gold
lured
them
to
horrors
yet
to
be
twisting
them
roughly
as
of
old
teasing
their
immobility
there
every
vice
and
passion
whim
had
seamed
the
flesh
abundantly
with
hideous
hieroglyphs

grim
that
headsmen
read
with
fluency

writ

the

fretted
with

some
dower

brutal
fascination

my

sweet
with

soft
and
white
my
favourite
frock
i
wore
it
well
who
wore
it
at
love
flowering
and
since
his
look
upon
it
fell
i
kept
it
as
a
sacred
thing
for
me
no
funeral
coronet
no
cushion
place
but
o
my
fair
lace
pillow
let
my
hair
droop
free
about
my

dear
pillow
often
did
it
mark
in
mad
sweet
nights
our
brows
unlit
and
all
within
the
gondola
dark
did
count
our
kisses
infinite
about
my
waxen
hands
supine
folded
in
prayer
at
life
deep
gloam
my
rosary
of
opals
twine
blessed
by
his
holiness
at

i
finger
it
when
bedded
cold
where
never
one
shall
rise
how
oft
his
lips
upon
my
lips
have
told
a
and
an
soft
heart
diamond
every
lover
deep
hath
set
in
a
sacred
nook
apart
some
dear
token
for
the
heart
in
its
hope
or
its
regret
one
hath
nested
safe
away
blackest
ringlet
ever
seen
over
which
an
azure
sheen
lieth
as
on
wing
of
jay
one
from

pale
as

that
softly
shine
in

reliquary
sweet

gloves
with

another

a

of

here
a

pearl
dissolved

a

of

standing
from

of
a

that
fell

wondrous

i
walked
along

a

great
review
of
ballad
writs
wherein
the
emperor
dimly
seen
numbered
the
shades
of
austerlitz
but
phantoms
near
the
and
wet
and
miry
phantoms
too
and
close
to
the
and
not
a
shroud
to
trick
the
view
with
yellow
teeth
and
stained

and
mossy

behold
it
press
death
in
the
very
light
of
noon
ah
is
a
picture
to
be
seen
three
veteran
ghosts
in
uniform
of
the
old
guard
and
spare
and
lean
two
in
daylight
storm
the
lithograph
you
would
surmise
wherein
one
ray
shines
down
upon
the
dead
that
raffet
deifies
that
pass

shout
napoleon
no
dead
are
these
whom
nightly
drum
may
rouse
to
battle
fires
that
burn
but
stragglers
of
the
old
guard
come
to
celebrate
the
grand
return
since
fighting
in
the
fight
supreme
one
has
grown
thin
another
stout
the
coats
that
fitted
once
now
seem
too
small
too
loose
or
draggled
out
o
epic
rags
o
tatters
light
starred
with
a
cross
heroic
things
of
ridicule
ye
gleam
more
bright
more
beautiful
than

the
tawny
colbacks
worn
and
grim
the
bullet
and
the
moth
have
torn
and
riddled
well
the

their
leathern
breeches
loosely
hang
in

on
their
lank
their
rusty
sabres

and
clang
as
heavily
they
scrape
the
stones
or
some
round
belly
firm
and
fat
squeezed
tight
in

mirth

to
chuckle
at

that

these

with

signs
that
twenty
skies
have
painted

their
scars
that
lengthen
out
the
lines
of
wrinkles
age
has
written
down
their
skin
whose
colour
deep
and
dun
bared
to
the
fronts
of
many

us
of

their

that
tell
of

if

if
they
limp
the

was

from

they
but
a

that
a

tore
an

mock
not
these
veteran
shapes
bizarre
at
whom
the
urchin
laughs
and
gapes
they
were
the
day
of
which
we
are
the
evening
and
the
night
perhaps
remembering
if
we
forget
red
lancer
grenadier
in
blue
with
faces
to
the
column
set
as
to
their
only
altar
true
there
proud
of
pain
each
scar
denotes
and
of
long
miseries
gone
by
they
feel
beneath
their
shabby
coats
the
heart
of
france
beat
mightily
and
so
our
smiles
are
steeped
in
tears
seeing
this
holy
carnival
this
picture
wan
that
reappears
like
morning
after
midnight
ball
and
cleaving
heaven
its
own
to
claim
wide
the
grand
army
eagle
spreads
its
golden
wings
like
glory
flame
above
their
dear
and
hallowed
heads
the
restless
gleam
and
glance
the
mad
white
coursers
cleave
the
length
of
ocean
as
they
rear
and
prance
and
toss
their
manes
in
stormy
strength
the
day
is
ending
raindrops
choke
the
sunset
furnaces
the
gloom
brings
the
great
steamboat
spitting
smoke
and
beating
down
its
long
black
plume
and
i
more
wan

wide
for
land
of
soot
and
fog
am
bound
for
land
of
smoke
and
suicide
and

have
i
found
how
eagerly
i
now
would
pierce
the
gulf
that
groweth
wild
and
hoar
the

rocks
the
waves
are
fierce
the
salt
wind
freshens
more
and
more
ah
bitter
is
my
soul
unrest
the
very
ocean
sighing
heaves
in
pity
its
unhopeful
breast
like
some
good
friend
that
knows
and
grieves
let
be
lost
love
despair
supreme
let
be
illusions
fair
that
rose

fell
from
pedestals
of

one
leap
the
dark
wet
ridges
close
away
ye
sufferings
gone
by
that
evermore
returning
brood
and
press
the
wounds
that
sleeping
lie
to
make
them
weep
afresh
their
blood
away
regret
whose
crimson
heart
hath
seven
swords
yea
one
maybe
doth
know
the
anguish
and
the
smart
mother
of
seven
sorrows
she
each
ghostly
grief
sinks
down
the
vast
and
struggles
with
the
waves
that
throb
to
close
about
it
and
at
last
drown
it
forever
with

she
will
not
come
stopped
forever
is
the
train
and
the
is
dumb
some
one
touched
it
soft
apart
where
the
silence
is
her
name
and
what
sinking
of
the
heart
at
the
plaintive
note
that
came
ah
the
anguish
when
the
tomb
robs
the
cradle
when
bereft
we
discover
in
the
gloom
child
toys
that
an
angel
left
after
writing
my
dramatic
review
my
columns
are
ranged
and
steady
upbearing
though
sad
forespent
the
newspaper
pediment
and
my
review
is
ready
now
for
a
week
poetaster
my
door
is
bolted
away
thou
masterpiece
aye
till
monday
i
am
my
master
no
melodrama
shall
whiten
my
labour
with
threadbare
leaves
the
warp
that
my
fancy
weaves
with
silken
flowers
shall
brighten
brief
moment
my
spirit
warder
ye
voices
of
soul
that
float
i
hearken
your
sorrow
note
nor
verses
evoke
to
order
then
deep
in
my
glass
regaining
the
health
of
a
day
gone
by
old
visions
for
company
the
bloom
of
my
vintage
draining
the
wine
of
my
thought
i
measure
wine
virgin
of
alien
glow
grapes
trodden
by
life
that
flow
from
my
heart
at
my
heart
own
pleasure
the
castle
of
remembrance
before
my
hearth
with
head
i
dream
and
strive
to
reach
again
across
the
misty
past
gray
cloud
unto
remembrance
domain
where
tree
and
house
and
upland
way
are
blurred
and
blue
like
passing
ghosts
and
the
eye
ponder
though
it
may
consults
in
vain
the
now
gropingly
to
gain
a
sight
of
all
the
buried
world
i
press
through
mystic
marge
of
shade
and
light
and
limbo
of
forgetfulness
but
white
diaphanous
memory
stands
where
many
roadways
meet
and
spread
like
ariadne
in
my
hands
thrusting
her
little
ball
of
thread
henceforth
the
way
is
all
secure
the
shrouded
sun
hath
reappeared
and
the
trees
with
vision
sure
i
see
the
castle
tower
upreared
beneath
the
boughs
where
day
grows
dark
with
shower
on
shower
of
leaves
the
dear
old
path
through
moss
and
bark
still
lengthens
far
its
narrow
cord
but
and
have
wrought
a
net
to
daunt
me
now
the
stubborn
branch
i
force
away
swings
fiercely
back
to
lash
my
brow
i
come
upon
the
house
at
last
no
window
lit
with
lamp
or
face
no
breath
of
smoke
from
gables
vast
to
touch
with
life
the
mouldering
place
bridges
are
crumbling
moats
are
still
and
slimed
with
rank
green
and
tortuous
waves
of
ivy
fill
the
crevices
and
choke
the
towers
the
portico
in
moonlight
wanes
time
sculptures
it
to
suit
his
whim
and
with
the
wash
of
many
rains
my
coloured
coat
of
arms
is
dim
the
door
i
open
eagerly
the
ancient
hinges
creak
and
halt
a
breath
of
dampness
wafts
to
me
the
musty
odour
of
the
vault
the
hairy
nettle
sharp
of
sting
the
coarse
and
burdock
weed
in
nooks
are
prospering
by
spreading
hemlocks
canopied
upon
two
marble
monsters
near
that
guard
the
mossy
steps
of
stone
the
shadow
of
a
tree
falls
clear
that
in
my
absence
has
upgrown
sudden
the
lion
sentinels
raise
their
paws
aggressive
and
malign
and
challenge
me
with
their
white
gaze
but
soft
i
breathe
the
countersign
i
pass
the
old
dog
menaceth
but
falls
back
hushed
the
shades
amid
my
resonant
footstep
wakeneth
crouched
echoes
in
their
corners
hid
through
yellow
panes
of
glass
a
ray
of
dubious
light
creeps
down
the
hall
where
ancient
tapestries
display
apollo
fortunes
from
the
wall
fair
daphne
still
with
grace
stretches
her
tufted
fingers
green
but
in
the
amorous
god
embrace
she
fades
a
formless
phantom
seen
i
watch
divine
apollo
stand
herdsman
to

the
muses
nine
a
haggard
band
upon
a
faded
pindus
weep
while
solitude
in
scanty
gown
traces
desertion
in
the
dust
that
through
the
air
she
sifteth
down
upon
a
marble
stand
august
and
now
among
forgotten
things
i
find
like
sleepers
manifold
pastels
bedimmed
dark
picturings
young
beauties
and
the
friends
of
old
my
faltering
fingers
lift
a
crape

my
love
with
look
and
lure
with
puffing
skirts
and
prisoned
shape
cidalise
pompadour
a
tender
blossoming
rose
she
feels
against
her
ribboned
bodice
pressed
whose
lace
half
hides
and

reveals
a
snowy
breast
within
her
eyes
gleam
sparkles
lush
as
on
the

upon
her
cheek
a
purple
flush
death

deceives
she
startles
as
i
come
before
and
fixeth
soft
on
me
her
eyes
reproachfully
forevermore

with
a
charm
and
witching
wise
life

me
from
thee
at

the
flaring

down
amid

unreaped
shunning
the
curious
in
repose
and
silence
all
the
long
day
steeped
a
little
woodland
daisy
blows
a
butterfly
upon
the

to
point
the

a

and
you
surprise
the
sweet
shy
thing
within
its

sequestered
nook
beneath
the
blue
it
openeth
rising
on
slender
vernal
rod
spreading
its

in
fragrant

for
solitude
and
for
its
god
and
proud
camellias
tall
and
white
red
tulips
in
a
flaming
mass

all
at

forgotten
quite
for
the

imperial
idleness
your

verily
this

this
garment

to
us
intriguing
with
its
mystery
the
every
oedipus
isis
bequeathed
her
veil
of
old
to
modern
daughters
of
the
nile
but
through
this
band
austere
behold
two
stars
of
radiance
beam
and
smile
two
stars
two
eyes
two
poems
that
spring
the
soft
voluptuous
fires
whereof
resolve
the
riddle
murmuring
lo
i
am
beauty
be
thou
love
the
garret
from

where
casual
cats
sit
low
in

i

the
worn
and
riven
slats
of
a
poor
humble
garret
rise
now
could
i
as
an
author
lie
to
give
you
comfort
as
you
think
its
window
i
would
falsify
and
frame
with
flowers
refined
and
pink
and
place
within
it
rigolette
with
her
cheap
somehow
whose
broken
glazing
mirrors
yet
a
portion
of
her
pretty
brow
or
margery
her
dress
undone
her
hair
blown
free
her
tie
forgot
watering
in
the
pleasant
sun
her
or
whom
fame
awaits
who
scans
his
verse
and
eyes
the

or
in
a
reverie
contemplates
montmartre
with
its
distant
mills
alas
my
garret
is
no
feint
there
climbeth
no
convolvulus
the
window
with
its
nibbled
paint
leers
filmy
and
unluminous
alike
for

and
grisette
alike
for
widower
and
lad
a
garret
save
to

is
never
otherwise
than
sad
of
old
beneath
an
angle
pent
that
forced
the
forehead
to
a
kiss
love
with
a
content
to
chat
with
susan
deemed
it
bliss
but
we
must
wad
our
bliss
about
with
cushioned
walls
and
laces
wide
and
silks
that
flutter
in
and
out
beds
by
monbro
canopied
this
evening
to

breda
fled
is
rigolette
to
linger
there
and
margery
well
clothed
and
fed
no

tends
her
garden
fair
the
poet
tired
of
catching
rimes
upon
the
wing
has
turned
to
cull
reporter
bays
and
left
betimes
a
heaven
for
an
entresol
and
in
the
window
this
is
all
an
ancient
goody
chattering
and
railing
at
a
kitten
small
that
toys
forever
with
a
string
the
cloud
lightly
in
the
azure
air
soars
a
cloud
emerging
free
like
a
virgin
from
the
fair
blue
sea
or
an
aphrodite
sweet
floating
upright
and
empearled
in
the
shell
about
its
feet
undulating
overhead
how
its
changing
body
glows
on
its
shoulder
dawn
hath
spread
a
rose

amorously
in

form
by

kissed
slumbering
antiope
of
mist
sailing
unto
distant
goal
over
alps
and
apennines
sister
of
the
it
shines
till
my
heart
flies
forth
at
last
on
the
wings
of
passion
warm
and
i
yearn
to
gather
fast
its
form
reason
saith
mere
vapour
thing
bursting
bubble
yet
we
deem
holds
this
ring
our
dream
faith
declareth
beauty
seen
like
a
cloud
is
but
a
thought
or
a
breath
that
having
been
is
naught
have
thy
vision
build
it
proud
let
thy
soul
be
full
thereof
love
a
woman
love
a
cloud
but
love
the
blackbird
a
bird
from
yonder
branch
at
dawn
is
trilling
forth
a
joyful
note
or
hopping
the
frozen
lawn
in
yellow
boots
and
ebon
coat
it
is
the
blackbird
credulous
little
of
calendar
knows
he
whose
soul
with
sunbeams
luminous
sings
april
to
the
snows
that
be
rain
sweeps
in
torrents
unrepressed
the
arve
makes
dull
the
rhone
with
mire
the
pleasant
hall
retains
its
guest
in
goodly
cheer
before
the
fire
the
mountains
have
their
ermine
on
each
one
a
mighty
magistrate
and
hold
grave
conference
upon
a
case
of
winter
lasting
late
the
bird
dries
well
his
wing
and
long
despite
the
rains
the
mists
that
roll
insists
upon
his
little
song
believes
in
spring
with
all
his
soul
he
softly
chides
the
slumberous
morn
for
dallying
so
long
abed
and
bids
the
shivering
flower
forlorn
be
bold
and
raise
aloft
its
head
behind
the
dark
sees
day
that
smiles
even
as
behind
the
holy
rod
when
bare
the
altar
dim
the
aisles
the
child
of
faith
beholds
his
god
he
trusts
to
nature
purpose
high
sure
of
her
laws
for
here
and
now
who
laughs
at
thy
philosophy
dear
blackbird
is
less
wise
than
thou
the
flower
that
makes
the
springtime
the
chestnut
trees
are
soon
to
flower
at
fair
jean
the
villa
dipped
in
sun
before
whose
viny
tower
stretch
purple
mountains
the
little
leaves
that
yesterday
pressed
in
their
bodices
were
seen
have
put
their
sober
garb
away
and
touched
the
tender
twigs
with
green
but
vainly
do
the
sunbeams
fill
the
branches
with
a
flood
of
light
the
shy
bud
hesitateth
still
to
show
the
secret
thyrse
of
white
and
yet
the
rosy
blooms
like
some
faint
blush
of
first
desire
the
apple
waves
a
wealth
of
plumes
and
laughs
in
all
its
fresh
attire
to
bask
amid
the
buttercups
the
timid
speedwell
ventures
out
nature
calls
every
earthling
up
and
reassures
each
tiny
sprout
yet
i
must
off
to
other
sphere
then
please
your
poet
chestnuts
tall
yea
spread
ye
forth
without
a
fear
your
firework
bloom
fantastical
i
know
your
summer
splendour
pride
i
seen
you
standing
sumptuous
in
autumn
tunics
with
golden
circlets
luminous
in
winter
white
and
your
delicate
boughs
i
saw
again
like
lovely
traceries
the
frost
limns
lightly
on
the
your
every
garment
i
have
known
ye
chestnuts
grand
that
loom
aloft
save
one
to
me
you
never
shown
of
young
green
fabric
first
and
soft
ah
well
for
i
must
go
keep
then
your
flowers
they
be
there
is
another
flower
i
know
that
makes
the
springtime
fair
for
me
let
may
with
all
her
blooms
arise
let
may
with
all
her
blooms
depart
that
flower
sufficeth
for
mine
eyes
and
hath
pure
honey
in
its
heart
let
be
the
season
where
it
waits
and
blue
or
dull
be
heaven
dome
it
smiles
and
charms
and
captivates
the
precious
violet
of
my
home
a
last
wish
how
long
my
soul
has
loved
thee
love
it
is
full
many
a
year
agone
thy
spring
what
charm
of
flowers
thereof
my
winter
what
wild
snows
thereon
white
lilacs
from
the
land
of
graves
blow
near
my
temples
soon
enow
mark
the
pallid
mass
that
waves
enshadowing
my
withered
brow
my
westering
sun
must
speedy
drop
and
disappear
behind
the
road
already
on
the
dim
there
gleams
and
waits
my
last
abode
then
from
thy
rosy
lips
let
fall
upon
my
lips
a
tardy
kiss
that
in
my
tomb
when
comes
the
call
my
heart
may
rest
remembering
this
the
dove
o
tender
beauteous
dove
calling
such
plaintive
things
wilt
serve
unto
my
love
and
be
my
love
own
wings
o
but
we
like
poor
heart
thy
dear
one
too
is
far
remembering
apart
each
weeps
beneath
the
star
let
not
thy
rosy
feet
stay
once
on
any
tower
i
am
so
fain
my
sweet
so
weary
turns
the
hour
forswear
the
palm
repose
that
spreadeth
over
all
and
gables
where
the
snows
of
other
pinions
fall
now
fail
me
not
nor
fear
he
dwelleth
near
the
king
give
him
this
letter
dear
these
kisses
on
thy
wing
then
seek
again
my
breast
this
flaming
throbbing
goal
then
come
my
dove
and
rest
but
bring
me
back
his
soul
a
pleasant
evening
what
flurrying
of
rains
and
snows
now
every
coachman
blue
of
nose
in
fur
and
ire
sits
petrified
oh
it
were
right
to
spend
this
wild
december
night
before
one
fire
the
cosy
chair
assumes
its
most
persuasive
air
i
seem
to
see
its
arms
held
out
its
voice
to
hear
beseeching
like
a
mistress
dear
ah
stay
with
me
a
gauze
reveals
the
orbèd
lamp
like
a
fair
breast
beneath
a
guimpe
and
drowsily
the
shimmer
of
its
light
ascends
flushing
with
gold
and
crimson
blends
the
ceiling
high
the
silence
frames
no
sound
of
things
save
for
the
pendulum
that
swings
its
golden
disk
and
many
winds
that
roam
and
weep
or
stealthy
to
the
sweep
to
dance
and
frisk
it
at
the
embassy
my
coat
limp
sleeves
are
signalling
me
to
dress
anon
my
waistcoat
yawns
my
shirt
obtuse
seems
raising
high
its
wristbands
loose
to
be
put
on
a
narrow
boot
abundant
glaze
reflects
the
ruddy
firelight
blaze
have
i
forgot
a
glove
flat
fingers
span
the
shelf
a
thin
cravat
protrudes
itself
and
begs
a
knot
then
must
i
forth
but
what
a
bore
to
seek
the
door
to
fall
in
line
of
coaches
bearing
coats
of
arms
and
haughty
beauties
with
their
charms
superb
and
fine
to
stand
against
a
portal
wide
and
see
the
surging
mass
inside
bear
form
on
form
old
faces
faces
fresh
and
young
black
coats
low
bodices
among
a
motley
swarm
and
puffy
backs
that
hide
their
red
with
laces
fine
of
costly
thread
aerial
dandies
diplomatists
that
press
with
features
dull
expressionless
at
fashion
call
what
brave
to
win
a
glance
of
hers
the
rows
of
dowagers
try
undeterred
to
speak
the
dear
name
of
my
dear
and
whisper
softly
in
her
ear
love
little
word
nay
but
i
not
her
eye
shall
heed
a
letter
in
the
flowers
i
speed
no
now
let
parma
violets
make
good
whatever
be
her
passing
mood
they
hold
my
vow
ensconced
with
heine
or
with
taine
or
if
i
like
the
goncourts
twain
the
time
will
go
i
dream
until
the
hour
shall
stir
reality
and
wait
for
her
she
