what
was

down
in
the
reeds
by
the
river
spreading
ruin
and
scattering
ban
splashing
and
paddling
with
hoofs
of
a
goat
and
breaking
the
golden
lilies
afloat
with
the
on
the
river
he
tore
out
a
reed
the
great
god
pan
from
the
deep
cool
bed
of
the
river
the
limpid
water
turbidly
ran
and
the
broken
lilies
lay
and
the
had
fled
away
ere
he
brought
it
out
of
the
river
high
on
the
shore
sat
the
great
god
pan
while
turbidly
flowed
the
river
and
hacked
and
hewed
as
a
great
god
can
with
his
hard
bleak
steel
at
the
patient
reed
till
there
was
not
a
sign
of
a
leaf
indeed
to
prove
it
fresh
from
the
river
he
cut
it
short
did
the
great
god
pan
how
tall
it
stood
in
the
river
then
drew
the
pith
like
the
heart
of
a
man
steadily
from
the
outside
ring
and
notched
the
poor
dry
empty
thing
in
holes
as
he
sat
by
the
river
this
is
the
way
laughed
the
great
god
pan
laughed
while
he
sat
by
the
river
the
only
way
since
gods
began
to
make
sweet
music
they
could
succeed
then
dropping
his
mouth
to
a
hole
in
the
reed
he
blew
in
power
by
the
river
sweet
sweet
sweet
o
pan
piercing
sweet
by
the
river
blinding
sweet
o
great
god
pan
the
sun
on
the
hill
forgot
to
die
and
the
lilies
revived
and
the
came
back
to
dream
on
the
river
yet
half
a
beast
is
the
great
god
pan
to
laugh
as
he
sits
by
the
river
making
a
poet
out
of
a
man
the
true
gods
sigh
for
the
cost
and
pain
for
the
reed
which
grows
nevermore
again
as
a
reed
with
the
reeds
in
the
river
barrett
the
voyage
we
left
behind
the
painted
buoy
that
tosses
at
the
and
madly
danced
our
hearts
with
joy
as
fast
we
fleeted
to
the
south
how
fresh
was
every
sight
and
sound
on
open
main
or
winding
shore
we
knew
the
merry
world
was
round
and
we
might
sail
forevermore
warm
broke
the
breeze
against
the
brow
dry
sang
the
tackle
sang
the
sail
the
upon
the
prow
caught
the
shrill
salt
and
sheered
the
gale
the
broad
seas
swelled
to
meet
the
keel
and
swept
behind
so
quick
the
run
we
felt
the
good
ship
shake
and
reel
we
seemed
to
sail
into
the
sun
how
oft
we
saw
the
sun
retire
and
burn
the
threshold
of
the
night
fall
from
his
of
fire
and
sleep
beneath
his
pillared
light
how
oft
the
robe
of
twilight
slowly
downward
drawn
as
through
the
slumber
of
the
globe
again
we
dashed
into
the
dawn
new
stars
all
night
above
the
brim
of
waters
lightened
into
view
they
climbed
as
quickly
for
the
rim
changed
every
moment
as
we
flew
far
ran
the
naked
moon
across
the
houseless
ocean
heaving
field
or
flying
shone
the
silver
boss
of
her
own
halo
dusky
shield
the
peaky
islet
shifted
shapes
high
towns
on
hills
were
dimly
seen
we
passed
long
lines
of
northern
capes
and
dewy
northern
meadows
green
we
came
to
warmer
waves
and
deep
across
the
boundless
east
we
drove
where
those
long
swells
of
breaker
sweep
the
nutmeg
rocks
and
isles
of
clove
by
peaks
that
flamed
or
all
in
shade
gloomed
the
low
coast
and
quivering
brine
with
ashy
rains
that
spreading
made
fantastic
plume
or
sable
pine
by
sands
and
steaming
flats
and
floods
of
mighty
mouth
we
scudded
fast
and
hills
and
woods
glowed
for
a
moment
as
we
passed
o
hundred
shores
of
happy
climes
how
swiftly
streamed
ye
by
the
bark
at
times
the
whole
sea
burned
at
times
with
wakes
of
fire
we
tore
the
dark
at
times
a
carven
craft
would
shoot
from
havens
hid
in
fairy
bowers
with
naked
limbs
and
flowers
and
fruit
but
we
nor
paused
for
fruits
nor
flowers
for
one
fair
vision
ever
fled
down
the
waste
waters
day
and
night
and
still
we
followed
where
she
led
in
hope
to
gain
upon
her
flight
her
face
was
evermore
unseen
and
fixed
upon
the
far
but
each
man
murmured
o
my
queen
i
follow
till
i
make
thee
mine
and
now
we
lost
her
now
she
gleamed
like
fancy
made
of
golden
air
now
nearer
to
the
prow
she
seemed
like
virtue
firm
like
knowledge
fair
now
high
on
waves
that
idly
burst
like
heavenly
hope
she
crowned
the
sea
and
now
the
bloodless
point
reversed
she
bore
the
blade
of
liberty
and
only
one
among
us
him
we
pleased
not
he
was
seldom
pleased
he
saw
not
far
his
eyes
were
dim
but
ours
he
swore
were
all
diseased
a
ship
of
fools
he
shrieked
in
spite
a
ship
of
fools
he
sneered
and
wept
and
overboard
one
stormy
night
he
cast
his
body
and
on
we
swept
and
never
sail
of
ours
was
furled
nor
anchor
dropped
at
eve
or
morn
we
loved
the
glories
of
the
world
but
laws
of
nature
were
our
scorn
for
blasts
would
rise
and
rave
and
cease
but
whence
were
those
that
drove
the
sail
across
the
whirlwind
heart
of
peace
and
to
and
through
the
again
to
colder
climes
we
came
for
still
we
followed
where
she
led
now
mate
is
blind
and
captain
lame
and
half
the
crew
are
sick
or
dead
but
blind
or
lame
or
sick
or
sound
we
follow
that
which
flies
before
we
know
the
merry
world
is
round
and
we
may
sail
forevermore
kubla
khan
in
xanadu
did
kubla
khan
a
stately
decree
where
alph
the
sacred
river
ran
through
caverns
measureless
to
man
down
to
a
sunless
sea
so
twice
five
miles
of
fertile
ground
with
walls
and
towers
were
girdled
round
and
there
were
gardens
bright
with
sinuous
rills
where
blossomed
many
an
tree
and
here
were
forests
ancient
as
the
hills
enfolding
sunny
spots
of
greenery
but
oh
that
deep
romantic
chasm
which
slanted
down
the
green
hill
athwart
a
cedarn
cover
a
savage
place
as
holy
and
enchanted
as
beneath
a
waning
moon
was
haunted
by
woman
wailing
for
her
and
from
this
chasm
with
ceaseless
turmoil
seething
as
if
this
earth
in
fast
thick
pants
were
breathing
a
mighty
fountain
momently
was
forced
amid
whose
swift
burst
huge
fragments
vaulted
like
rebounding
hail
or
chaffy
grain
beneath
the
thresher
flail
and
these
dancing
rocks
at
once
and
ever
it
flung
up
momently
the
sacred
river
five
miles
meandering
with
a
mazy
motion
through
wood
and
dale
the
sacred
river
ran
then
reached
the
caverns
measureless
to
man
and
sank
in
tumult
to
a
lifeless
ocean
and
this
tumult
kubla
heard
from
far
ancestral
voices
prophesying
war
the
shadow
of
the
dome
of
pleasure
floated
midway
on
the
waves
where
was
heard
the
mingled
measure
from
the
fountain
and
the
caves
it
was
a
miracle
of
rare
device
a
sunny
with
caves
of
ice
a
damsel
with
a
dulcimer
in
a
vision
once
i
saw
it
was
an
abyssinian
maid
and
on
her
dulcimer
she
played
singing
of
mount
abora
could
i
revive
within
me
her
symphony
and
song
to
such
a
deep
delight
win
me
that
with
music
loud
and
long
i
would
build
that
dome
in
air
that
sunny
dome
those
caves
of
ice
and
all
who
heard
should
see
them
there
and
all
should
cry
beware
beware
his
flashing
eyes
his
floating
hair
weave
a
circle
round
him
thrice
and
close
your
eyes
with
holy
dread
for
he
on
hath
fed
and
drunk
the
milk
of
paradise
taylor
she
was
a
phantom
of
delight
she
was
a
phantom
of
delight
when
first
she
gleamed
upon
my
sight
a
lovely
apparition
sent
to
be
a
moment
ornament
her
eyes
as
stars
of
twilight
fair
like
twilight
too
her
dusky
hair
but
all
things
else
about
her
drawn
from
and
the
cheerful
dawn
a
dancing
shape
an
image
gay
to
haunt
to
startle
and
waylay
i
saw
her
upon
nearer
view
a
spirit
yet
a
woman
too
her
household
motions
light
and
free
and
steps
of
a
countenance
in
which
did
meet
sweet
records
promises
as
sweet
a
creature
not
too
bright
or
good
for
human
nature
daily
food
for
transient
sorrows
simple
wiles
praise
blame
love
kisses
tears
and
smiles
and
now
i
see
with
eye
serene
the
very
pulse
of
the
machine
a
being
breathing
thoughtful
breath
a
traveller
between
life
and
death
the
reason
firm
the
temperate
will
endurance
foresight
strength
and
skill
a
perfect
woman
nobly
planned
to
warn
to
comfort
and
command
and
yet
a
spirit
still
and
bright
with
something

i
fill
this

to
one
made
up
of
loveliness
alone
a
woman
of
her
gentle
sex
the
seeming
paragon
to
whom
the
better
elements
and
kindly
stars
have
given
a
form
so
fair
that
like
the
air
is
less
of
earth
than
heaven
her
every
tone
is
music
own
like
those
of
morning
birds
and
something
more
than
melody
dwells
ever
in
her
words
the
coinage
of
her
heart
are
they
and
from
her
lips
each
flows
as
one
may
see
the
burdened
bee
forth
issue
from
the
rose
affections
are
as
thoughts
to
her
the
measures
of
her
hours
her
feelings
have
the
fragrancy
the
freshness
of
young
flowers
and
lovely
passions
changing
oft
so
fill
her
she
appears
the
image
of
themselves
by
turns
the
idol
of
past
years
of
her
bright
face
one
glance
will
trace
a
picture
on
the
brain
and
of
her
voice
in
echoing
hearts
a
sound
must
long
remain
but
memory
such
as
mine
of
her
so
very
much
endears
when
death
is
nigh
my
latest
sigh
will
not
be
life
but
hers
i
fill
this
cup
to
one
made
up
of
loveliness
alone
a
woman
of
her
gentle
sex
the
seeming
paragon
her
health
and
would
on
earth
there
stood
some
more
of
such
a
frame
that
life
might
be
all
poetry
and
weariness
a
name
coate
on
a
girdle
that
which
her
slender
waist
confined
shall
now
my
joyful
temples
bind
no
monarch
but
would
give
his
crown
his
arms
might
do
what
this
hath
done
it
was
my
heaven
extremest
sphere
the
pale
which
held
that
lovely
deer
my
joy
my
grief
my
hope
my
love
did
all
within
this
circle
move
a
narrow
compass
and
yet
there
dwelt
all
that
good
and
all
that
fair
give
me
but
what
this
ribbon
bound
take
all
the
rest
the
sun
goes
round
a
nice
correspondent
the
glow
and
the
glory

wish
you
were
here
i
am
wearing
my
lazuli
necklace
the
necklace
you
fastened
askew
was
there
ever
so
rude
or
so
reckless
a
darling
as
you
i
want
you
to
come
and
pass
sentence
on
two
or
three
books
with
a
plot
of
course
you
know
janet
repentance
i
reading
sir
waverley
scott
the
story
of
edgar
and
lucy
how
thrilling
romantic
and
true
the
master
his
bride
was
a
goosey
reminds
me
of
you
in
my
ride
i
been
crowning
the
beacon
its
magic
still
lures
for
up
there
you
discoursed
about
browning
that
stupid
old
browning
of
yours
his
vogue
and
his
verve
are
alarming
i
anxious
to
give
him
his
due
but
fred
he
not
nearly
so
charming
a
poet
as
you
i
heard
how
you
shot
at
the
beeches
i
saw
how
you
rode
chanticleer
i
have
read
the
report
of
your
speeches
and
echoed
the
echoing
cheer
there
a
whisper
of
hearts
you
are
breaking
i
envy
their
owners
i
do
small
marvel
that
fortune
is
making
her
idol
of
you
alas
for
the
world
and
its
dearly
bought
triumph
and
fugitive
bliss
sometimes
i
half
wish
i
were
merely
a
plain
or
a
penniless
miss
but
perhaps
one
is
best
with
a
measure
of
pelf
and
i
not
sorry
too
that
i
pretty
because
it
a
pleasure
my
dearest
to
you
your
whim
is
for
frolic
and
fashion
your
taste
is
for
letters
and
art
this
rhyme
is
the
commonplace
passion
that
glows
in
a
fond
woman
heart
lay
it
by
in
a
dainty
deposit

mother

of
the
summer
wind
dying
merrily
cheerily
noisily
whirring
swings
the
wheel
spins
the
reel
while
the
foot
stirring
sprightly
and
lightly
and
airily
ringing
thrills
the
sweet
voice
of
the
young
maiden
singing
what
that
noise
that
i
hear
at
the
window
i
wonder
is
the
little
birds
chirping
the
under
what
makes
you
be
shoving
and
moving
your
stool
on
and
singing
all
wrong
that
old
song
of
coolun
there
a
form
at

casement
the
form
of
her
and

get
up
on
the
stool
through
the
lattice
step
lightly
we
rove
in
the
grove
while
the
moon
shining
brightly
merrily
cheerily
noisily
whirring
swings
the
wheel
spins
the
reel
while
the
foot
stirring
sprightly

the

of

maiden
singing
the
maid
shakes
her
head
on

lip
lays
her
fingers

up
from
her
seat
longs
to
go
and
yet
lingers
a
frightened
glance
turns
to
her
drowsy
grandmother
puts
one
foot
on
the
stool
spins
the
wheel
with
the
other
lazily
easily
swings
now
the
wheel
round
slowly
and
lowly
is
heard
now
the
reel
sound
noiseless
and
light
to
the
lattice
above
her
the
maid
steps
then
leaps
to
the
arms
of
her
lover
slower
and
slower
and
slower
the
wheel
swings
lower
and
lower
and
lower
the
reel
rings
ere
the
reel
and
the
wheel
stop
their
ringing
and
moving
through
the
grove
the
young
lovers
by
moonlight
are
roving
francis
she
walks
in
beauty
she
walks
in
beauty
like
the
night
of
cloudless
climes
and
starry
skies
and
all
that
best
of
dark
and
bright
meets
in
her
aspect
and
her
eyes
thus
mellowed
to
that
tender
light
which
heaven
to
gaudy
day
denies
one
shade
the
more
one
ray
the
less
had
half
impaired
the
nameless
grace
which
waves
in
every
raven
tress
or
softly
lightens
her
face
where
thoughts
serenely
sweet
express
how
pure
how
dear
their
and
on
that
cheek
and
that
brow
so
soft
so
calm
yet
eloquent
the
smiles
that
win
the
tints
that
glow
but
tell
of
days
in
goodness
spent
a
mind
at
peace
with
all
below
a
heart
whose
love
is
innocent
the
welcome
come
in
the
evening
or
come
in
the
morning
come
when
you
looked
for
or
come
without
warning
kisses
and
welcome
you
find
here
before
you
and
the
oftener
you
come
here
the
more
i
adore
you
light
is
my
heart
since
the
day
we
were
plighted
red
is
my
cheek
that
they
told
me
was
blighted
the
green
of
the
trees
looks
far
greener
than
ever
and
the
linnets
are
singing
true
lovers
do
sever
i
pull
you
sweet
flowers
to
wear
if
you
choose
them
or
after
you
kissed
them
they
lie
on
my
bosom
i
fetch
from
the
mountain
its
breeze
to
inspire
you
i
fetch
from
my
fancy
a
tale
that
wo
tire
you
o
your
step
like
the
rain
to
the
farmer
or
sabre
and
shield
to
a
knight
without
armor
i
sing
you
sweet
songs
till
the
stars
rise
above
me
then
wandering
i
wish
you
in
silence
to
love
me
we
look
through
the
trees
at
the
cliff
and
the
eyry
we
tread
round
the
rath
on
the
track
of
the
fairy
we
look
on
the
stars
and
we
list
to
the
river
till
you
ask
of
your
darling
what
gift
you
can
give
her
o
she
whisper
you
love
as
unchangeably
beaming
and
trust
when
in
secret
most
tunefully
streaming
till
the
starlight
of
heaven
above
us
shall
quiver
as
our
souls
flow
in
one
down
eternity
river
so
come
in
the
evening
or
come
in
the
morning
come
when
you
looked
for
or
come
without
warning
kisses
and
welcome
you
find
here
before
you
and
the
oftener
you
come
here
the

true

do
sever
the
brookside
i
wandered
by
the
brookside
i
wandered
by
the
mill
i
could
not
hear
the
brook
flow
the
noisy
wheel
was
still
there
was
no
burr
of
grasshopper
no
chirp
of
any
bird
but
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
was
all
the
sound
i
heard
i
sat
beneath
the
i
watched
the
long
long
shade
and
as
it
grew
still
longer
i
did
not
feel
afraid
for
i
listened
for
a
footfall
i
listened
for
a
word
but
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
was
all
the
sound
i
heard
he
came
not
no
he
came
not
the
night
came
on
alone
the
little
stars
sat
one
by
one
each
on
his
golden
throne
the
evening
wind
passed
by
my
cheek
the
leaves
above
were
stirred
but
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
was
all
the
sound
i
heard
fast
silent
tears
were
flowing
when
something
stood
behind
a
hand
was
on
my
shoulder
i
knew
its
touch
was
kind
it
drew
me
nearer
nearer
we
did
not
speak
one
word
for
the
beating
of
our
own
hearts
was
all
the
sound
we
heard
monckton
mariana
mariana
in
the
moated
grange
for
with
blackest
moss
the
were
thickly
crusted
one
and
all
the
rusted
nails
fell
from
the
knots
that
held
the
peach
to
the
the
broken
sheds
looked
sad
and
strange
unlifted
was
the
clinking
latch
weeded
and
worn
the
ancient
thatch
upon
the
lonely
moated
grange
she
only
said
my
life
is
dreary
he
cometh
not
she
said
she
said
i
am
aweary
aweary
i
would
that
i
were
dead
her
tears
fell
with
the
dews
at
even
her
tears
fell
ere
the
dews
were
dried
she
could
not
look
on
the
sweet
heaven
either
at
morn
or
eventide
after
the
flitting
of
the
bats
when
thickest
dark
did
trance
the
sky
she
drew
her
by
and
glanced
athwart
the
glooming
flats
she
only
said
the
night
is
dreary
he
cometh
not
she
said
she
said
i
am
aweary
aweary
i
would
that
i
were
dead
upon
the
middle
of
the
night
waking
she
heard
the
crow
the
cock
sung
out
an
hour
ere
light
from
the
dark
fen
the
oxen
low
came
to
her
without
hope
of
change
in
sleep
she
seemed
to
walk
forlorn
till
cold
winds
woke
the
morn
about
the
lonely
moated
grange
she
only
said
the
day
is
dreary
he
cometh
not
she
said
she
said
i
am
aweary
aweary
i
would
that
i
were
dead
about
a
from
the
wall
a
sluice
with
blackened
waters
slept
and
it
many
round
and
small
the
clustered
crept
hard
by
a
poplar
shook
alway
all
with
gnarléd
bark
for
leagues
no
other
tree
did
mark
the
level
waste
the
rounding
gray
she
only
said
my
life
is
dreary
he
cometh
not
she
said
she
said
i
am
aweary
aweary
i
would
that
i
were
dead
and
ever
when
the
moon
was
low
and
the
shrill
winds
were
up
and
away
in
the
white
curtain
to
and
fro
she
saw
the
gusty
shadow
sway
but
when
the
moon
was
very
low
and
wild
winds
bound
within
their
cell
the
shadow
of
the
poplar
fell
upon
her
bed
across
her
brow
she
only
said
the
night
is
dreary
he
cometh
not
she
said
she
said
i
am
aweary
aweary
i
would
that
i
were
dead
all
day
within
the
dreamy
house
the
doors
upon
their
hinges
creaked
the
sung
i
the
pane
the
mouse
behind
the
mouldering
wainscot
shrieked
or
from
the
crevice
peered
about
old
faces
glimmered
through
the
doors
old
footsteps
trod
the
upper
floors
old
voices
called
her
from
without
she
only
said
my
life
is
dreary
he
cometh
not
she
said
she
said
i
am
aweary
aweary
i
would
that
i
were
dead
the
sparrow
chirrup
on
the
roof
the
slow
clock
ticking
and
the
sound
which
to
the
wooing
wind
aloof
the
poplar
made
did
all
confound
her
sense
but
most
she
loathed
the
hour
when
the
sunbeam
lay
athwart
the
chambers
and
the
day
was
sloping
toward
his
western
bower
then
said
she
i
am
very
dreary
he
will
not
come
she
said
she
wept
i
am
aweary
aweary
o
god
that
i
were
dead
the
splendor
falls
on
castle
walls
and
snowy
summits
old
in
story
the

not

were

and

were
running

and

all
below
the

on
the
down
the
while
my
mare
with
dipping
head
pulled
on
my

above
the

i
saw
come
on
beside
the
ridge
a
maiden
white
in
skin
and
thread
and
walking
with
an
the

i
drove
along
my
road
as
there
with
comely
steps
up
hill
she
rose
by
all
in
ranks
from
shade
to
shade
by
flowery
banks
where
flew
the

with

kindly
said

you

cried

up

that
which

so
at

o

before
all

look
deeper

that
thou

kept
a

back
while
i

the
whole

no
false
pity
spare
the

but
in
true
mercy
tell
me
so
is
there
within
thy

a

that
mine
can
not
fulfil
one
chord
that
any

could
better
wake

at

my

hid
the

shedding
a
passing

still
on
all
things
new
and
strange
it
may
not
be
thy
fault
alone
but
shield
my
heart
against
thine
own
couldst
thou
withdraw
thy
hand
one
day
and
answer
to
my
claim
that
fate
and
that
mistake
not
thou
had
been
to
blame
some
soothe
their
conscience
thus
but
thou
wilt
surely
warn
and
save
me
now
nay
answer
i
dare
not
hear
the
words
would
come
too
late
yet
i
would
spare
thee
all
remorse
so
comfort
thee
my
fate
whatever
on
my
heart
may
fall
remember
i
risk
it
all
anne
sonnets
when
forty
winters
shall
besiege
thy
brow
and
dig
deep
trenches
in
thy
beauty
field
thy
youth
proud
livery
so
gazed
on
now
will
be
a
tattered
weed
of
small
worth
held
then
being
asked
where
all
thy
beauty
lies
where
all
the
treasure
of
thy
lusty
days
to
say
within
thine
own
eyes
were
an
shame
and
thriftless
praise
how
much
more
praise
deserved
thy
beauty
use
if
thou
couldst
answer
this
fair
child
of
mine
shall
sum
my
count
and
make
my
old
excuse
proving
his
beauty
by
succession
thine
this
were
to
be
when
thou
art
old
and
see
thy
blood
warm
when
thou
it
cold
when
i
do
count
the
clock
that
tells
the
time
and
see
the
brave
day
sunk
in
hideous
night
when
i
behold
the
violet
past
prime
and
sable
curls
all
silvered
with
white
when
lofty
trees
i
see
barren
of
leaves
which
erst
from
heat
did
canopy
the
herd
and
summer
green
all
girded
up
in
sheaves
borne
on
the
bier
with
white
and
bristly
beard
then
of
thy
beauty
do
i
question
make
that
thou
among
the
wastes
of
time
must
go
since
sweets
and
beauties
do
themselves
forsake
and
die
as
fast
as
they
see
others
grow
and
nothing
time
scythe
can
make
defence
save
breed
to
brave
him
when
he
takes
thee
hence
my
glass
shall
not
persuade
me
i
am
old
so
long
as
youth
and
thou
are
of
one
date
but
when
in
thee
time
furrows
i
behold
then
look
i
death
my
days
should
expiate
for
all
that
beauty
that
doth
cover
thee
is
but
the
seemly
raiment
of
my
heart
which
in
thy
breast
doth
live
as
thine
in
me
how
can
i
then
be
elder
than
thou
art
o
therefore
love
be
of
thyself
so
wary
as
i
not
for
myself
but
for
thee
will
bearing
thy
heart
which
i
will
keep
so
chary
as
tender
nurse
her
babe
from
faring
presume
not
on
thy
heart
when
mine
is
slain
thou
me
thine
not
to
give
back
again
as
an
unperfect
actor
on
the
stage
who
with
his
fear
is
put
beside
his
part
or
some
fierce
thing
replete
with
too
much
rage
whose
strength
abundance
weakens
his
own
heart
so
i
for
fear
of
trust
forget
to
say
the
perfect
ceremony
of
love
rite
and
in
mine
own
love
strength
seem
to
decay
with
burthen
of
mine
own
love
might
o
let
my
books
be
then
the
eloquence
and
dumb
presagers
of
my
speaking
breast
who
plead
for
love
and
look
for
recompense
more
than
that
tongue
that
more
hath
more
expressed
o

to
read
what
silent
love
hath
writ
to
hear

shall
i
compare
thee
to
a
summer
day
thou
art
more
lovely
and
more
temperate
rough
winds
do
shake
the
darling
buds
of
may
and
summer

hath
all
too
short
a
date
sometime
too
hot
the
eye
of

often
is
his
gold
complexion
dimmed
and
every
fair
from
fair
sometime
declines
by
chance
or

untrimmed
but
thy
eternal
summer
shall
not
fade
nor
lose
possession
of
that
fair
thou
owest
nor
shall
death
brag
thou
in
his
shade
when
in
eternal
lines
to

thou
growest
so
long
as

can
breathe
or

break
break
break
break
break
break
on
thy
cold
gray
stones
o
sea
and
i
would
that
my
tongue
could
utter
the
thoughts
that
arise
in
me
o
well
for
the
fisherman
boy
that
he
shouts
with
his
sister
at
play
o
well
for
the
sailor
lad
that
he
sings
in
his
boat
on
the
bay
and
the
stately
ships
go
on
to
the
haven
under
the
hill
but
o
for
the
touch
of
a
vanished
hand
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
that
is
still
break
break
break
at
the
foot
of
thy
crags
o
sea
but
the
tender
grace
of
a
day
that
is
dead
will
never
come
back
to
me
astarte
when
the
latest
strife
is
lost
and
all
is
done
with
ere
we
slumber
in
the
spirit
and
the
brain
we
drowse
back
in
dreams
to
days
that
life
begun
with
and
their
tender
light
returns
to
us
again
i
have
cast
away
the
tangle
and
the
torment
of
the
cords
that
bound
my
life
up
in
a
mesh
and
the
pulse
begins
to
throb
that
long
lay
dormant
their
pressure
and
the
old
wounds
bleed
afresh
i
am
touched
again
with
shades
of
early
sadness
like
the
light
shadow
in
my
hair
i
am
thrilled
again
with
breaths
of
boyish
gladness
like
the
scent
of
some
last
primrose
on
the
air
and
again
she
comes
with
all
her
silent
graces
the
lost
woman
of
my
youth
yet
unpossessed
and
her
cold
face
so
unlike
the
other
faces
of
the
women
whose
dead
lips
i
since
have
pressed
the
motion
and
the
fragrance
of
her
garments
seem
about
me
all
the
day
long
in
the
room
and
her
face
with
its
bewildering
old
endearments
comes
at
night
between
the
curtains
in
the
gloom
when
vain
dreams
are
stirred
with
sighing
near
the
morning
to
my
own
her
phantom
lips
i
feel
approach
and
her
smile
at
eve
breaks
me
without
warning
from
its
speechless
pale
perpetual
reproach
when
life
dawning
glimmer
yet
had
all
the
tint
there
of
the
orient
in
the
freshness
of
the
grass
ah
what
feet
since
then
have
trodden
out
the
print
there
did
her
soft
her
silent
footsteps
fall
and
pass
they
fell
lightly
as
the
dew
falls
ungathered
and
lightly
lingered
with
the
dew
but
the
dew
is
gone
the
grass
is
dried
and
withered
and
the
traces
of
those
steps
have
faded
too
other
footsteps
fall
about
me
faint
uncertain
in
the
shadow
of
the
world
as
it
recedes
other
forms
peer
through
the
curtain
of
that
mystery
which
hangs
behind
the
creeds
what
is
gone
is
gone
forever
and
new
fashions
may
replace
old
forms
which
nothing
can
restore
but
i
turn
from
sighing
back
departed
passions
with
that
pining
at
the
bosom
as
of
yore
i
remember
to
have
murmured
morn
and
even
though
the
earth
dispart
these
earthlies
face
from
face
yet
the
heavenlies
shall
surely
join
in
heaven
for
the
spirit
hath
no
bonds
in
time
or
space
where
it
listeth
there
it
bloweth
all
existence
is
its
region
and
it
houseth
where
it
will
i
shall
feel
her
through
immeasurable
distance
and
grow
nearer
and
be
gathered
to
her
still
if
i
fail
to
find
her
out
by
her
gold
tresses
brows
and
breast
and
lips
and
language
of
sweet
strains
i
shall
know
her
by
the
traces
of
dead
kisses
and
that
portion
of
myself
which
she
retains
but
my
being
is
confused
with
new
experience
and
changed
to
something
other
than
it
was
and
the
future
with
the
past
is
set
at
variance
and
life
falters
with
the
burthens
which
it
has
earth
old
sins
press
fast
behind
me
weakly
wailing
faint
before
me
fleets
the
good
i
have
not
done
and
my
search
for
her
may
still
be
unavailing
the
spirits
that
have
passed
beyond
the
sun
bulwer
my
heid
is
like
to

my

the
mango
tree
he
wiled
me
through
the
furzy
croft
he
wiled
me
down
the
sandy
lane
he
told
his
boy
love
soft
and
oft
until
i
told
him
mine
again
we
married
and
we
sailed
the
main
a
soldier
and
a
soldier
wife
we
marched
through
many
a
burning
plain
we
sighed
for
many
a
gallant
life
but
his
god
keep
it
safe
from
harm
he
toiled
and
dared
and
earned
command
and
those
three
stripes
upon
his
arm
were
more
to
me
than
gold
or
land
sure
he
would
win
some
great
renown
our
lives
were
strong
our
hearts
were
high
one
night
the
fever
struck
him
down
i
sat
and
stared
and
saw
him
die
i
had
his
children
one
two
three
one
week
i
had
them
blithe
and
sound
the
next
beneath
this
mango
tree
by
him
in
barrack
i
sit
beneath
the
mango
shade
i
live
my
five
years
life
all
round
yonder
stems
his
children
played
he
mounted
guard
at
yonder
door
is
i
not
they
am
gone
and
dead
they
live
they
know
they
feel
they
see
their
spirits
light
the
golden
shade
beneath
the
giant
mango
tree
all
things
save
i
are
full
of
life
the
minas
pluming
velvet
breasts
the
monkeys
in
their
foolish
strife
the
swooping
hawks
the
swinging
nests
the
lizards
basking
on
the
soil
the
butterflies
who
sun
their
wings
the
bees
about
their
household
toil
they
live
they
love
the
blissful
things
each
tender
purple
mango
shoot
that
folds
and
droops
so
bashful
down
it
lives
it
sucks
some
hidden
root
it
rears
at
last
a
broad
green
crown
it
blossoms
and
the
children
cry
watch
when
the
mango
apples
fall
it
lives
but
rootless
fruitless
i
i
breathe
and
dream
and
that
is
all
thus
am
i
dead
yet
can
not
die
but
still
within
my
foolish
brain
there
hangs
a
pale
blue
evening
sky
a
furzy
croft
a
sandy
lane
to
mary
in
heaven
thou
lingering
star
with
lessening
ray
that
to
greet
the
early
morn
again
thou
usherest
in
the
day
my
mary
from
my
soul
was
torn
o
mary
dear
departed
shade
where
is
thy
place
of
blissful
rest
thou
thy
lover
lowly
laid
thou
the
groans
that
rend
his
breast
that
sacred
hour
can
i
forget
can
i
forget
the
hallowed
grove
where
by
the
winding
ayr
we
met
to
live
one
day
of
parting
love
eternity
will
not
efface
those
records
dear
of
transports
past
thy
image
at
our
last
embrace
ah
little
thought
we
was
our
last
ayr
gurgling
kissed
his
pebbled
shore
with
wild
woods
thickening
green
the
fragrant
birch
and
hawthorn
hoar
twined
amorous
round
the
raptured
scene
the
flowers
sprang
wanton
to
be
pressed
the
birds
sang
love
on
every
spray
till
too
too
soon
the
glowing
west
proclaimed
the
speed
of
wingéd
day
still
these
scenes
my
memory
wakes
and
fondly
broods
with
miser
care
time
but
the
impression
deeper
makes
as
streams
their
channels
deeper
wear
my
mary
dear
departed
shade
where
is
thy
place
of
blissful
rest
thou
thy
lover
lowly
laid
thou
the
groans
that
rend
his
breast
a
song
for
september
september
strews
the
woodland
with
many
a
brilliant
color
the
world
is
brighter
than
before
why
should
our
hearts
be
duller
sorrow
and
the
scarlet
leaf
sad
thoughts
and
sunny
weather
ah
me
this
glory
and
this
grief
agree
not
well
together
this
is
the
parting
season
this
the
time
when
friends
are
flying
and
lovers
now
with
many
a
kiss
their
long
farewells
are
sighing
why
is
earth
so
gayly
dressed
this
pomp
that
autumn
beareth
a
funeral
seems
where
every
guest
a
bridal
garment
weareth
each
one
of
us
perchance
may
here
on
some
blue
morn
hereafter
return
to
view
the
gaudy
year
but
not
with
boyish
laughter
we
shall
then
be
wrinkled
men
our
brows
with
silver
laden
and
thou
this
glen
seek
again
but
nevermore
a
maiden
nature
perhaps
foresees
that
spring
will
touch
her
teeming
bosom
and
that
a
few
brief
months
will
bring
the
bird
the
bee
the
blossom
ah
these
forests
do
not
know
or
would
less
brightly
wither
the
virgin
that
adorns
them
so
will
nevermore
come
hither
william
oft
in
the
stilly
night
oft
in
the
stilly
night
ere
slumber
chain
has
bound
me
fond
memory
brings
the
light
of
other
days
around
me
the
smiles
the
tears
of
boyhood
years
the
words
of
love
then
spoken
the
eyes
that
shone
now
dimmed
and
gone
the
cheerful
hearts
now
broken
thus
in
the
stilly
night
ere
slumber
chain
has
bound
me
sad
memory
brings
the
light
of
other
days
around
me
when
i
remember
all
the
friends
so
linked
together
i
seen
around
me
fall
like
leaves
in
wintry
weather
i
feel
like
one
who
treads
alone
some
deserted
whose
lights
are
fled
whose
garlands
dead
and
all
but
he
departed
thus
in
the
stilly
night
ere
slumber
chain
has
bound
me
sad
memory
brings
the
light
of
other
days
around
me
the
days
that
are
no
more
tears
idle
tears
i
know
not
what
they
mean
tears
from
the
depth
of
some
divine
despair
rise
in
the
heart
and
gather
to
the
eyes
in
looking
on
the
happy
autumn
fields
and
thinking
of
the
days
that
are
no
more
fresh
as
the
first
beam
glittering
on
a
sail
that
brings
our
friends
up
from
the
under
world
sad
as
the
last
which
reddens
over
one
that
sinks
with
all
we
love
below
the
verge
so
sad
so
fresh
the
days
that
are
no
more
ah
sad
and
strange
as
in
dark
summer
dawns
the
earliest
pipe
of
birds
to
dying
ears
when
unto
dying
eyes
the
casement
slowly
grows
a
glimmering
square
so
sad
so
strange
the
days
that
are
no
more
dear
as
remembered
kisses
after
death
and
sweet
as
those
by
hopeless
fancy
feigned
on
lips
that
are
for
others
deep
as
love
deep
as
first
love
and
wild
with
all
regret
o
death
in
life
the
days
that
are
no
more
the
old
familiar
faces
i
have
had
playmates
i
have
had
companions
in
my
days
of
childhood
in
my
joyful
all
all
are
gone
the
old
familiar
faces
i
have
been
laughing
i
have
been
carousing
drinking
late
sitting
late
with
my
bosom
cronies
all
all
are
gone
the
old
familiar
faces
i
loved
a
love
once
fairest
among
women
closed
are
her
doors
on
me
i
must
not
see
her
all
all
are
gone
the
old
familiar
faces
i
have
a
friend
a
kinder
friend
has
no
man
like
an
ingrate
i
left
my
friend
abruptly
left
him
to
muse
on
the
old
familiar
faces
i
paced
round
the
haunts
of
my
childhood
earth
seemed
a
desert
i
was
bound
to
traverse
seeking
to
find
the
old
familiar
faces
friend
of
my
bosom
thou
more
than
a
brother
why
wert
thou
not
born
in
my
father
dwelling
so
might
we
talk
of
the
old
familiar
faces
how
some
they
have
died
and
some
they
have
left
me
and
some
are
taken
from
me
all
are
departed
all
all
are
gone
the
old
familiar
faces
time
changes
i
saw
her
once
so
freshly
fair
that
like
a
blossom
just
unfolding
she
opened
to
life
cloudless
air
and
nature
joyed
to
view
its
moulding
her
smile
it
haunts
my
memory
yet
her
cheek
fine
hue
divinely
glowing
her
rosebud
mouth
her
eyes
of
jet
around
on
all
their
light
bestowing
o
who
could
look
on
such
a
form
so
nobly
free
so
softly
tender
and
darkly
dream
that
earthly
storm
should
dim
such
sweet
delicious
splendor
for
in
her
mien
and
in
her
face
and
in
her
young
step
fairy
lightness
naught
could
the
raptured
gazer
trace
but
beauty
glow
and
pleasure
brightness
i
saw
her
twice
an
altered
charm
but
still
of
magic
richest
rarest
than
girlhood
talisman
less
warm
though
yet
of
earthly
sights
the
fairest
upon
her
breast
she
held
a
child
the
very
image
of
its
mother
which
ever
to
her
smiling
smiled
they
seemed
to
live
but
in
each
other
but
matron
cares
or
lurking
woe
her
thoughtless
sinless
look
had
banished
and
from
her
cheeks
the
roseate
glow
of
girlhood
balmy
morn
had
vanished
within
her
eyes
upon
her
brow
lay
something
softer
fonder
deeper
as
if
in
dreams
some
visioned
woe
had
broke
the
elysium
of
the
sleeper
i
saw
her
thrice
fate
dark
decree
in
widow
garments
had
arrayed
her
yet
beautiful
she
seemed
to
be
as
even
my
reveries
portrayed
her
the
glow
the
glance
had
passed
away
the
sunshine
and
the
sparkling
glitter
still
though
i
noted
pale
decay
the
retrospect
was
scarcely
bitter
for
in
their
place
a
calmness
dwelt
serene
subduing
soothing
holy
in
feeling
which
the
bosom
felt
that
every
louder
mirth
is
folly
a
pensiveness
which
is
not
grief
a
stillness
as
of
sunset
streaming
a
fairy
glow
on
flower
and
leaf
till
earth
looks
like
a
landscape
dreaming
a
last
time
and
unmoved
she
lay
beyond
life
dim
uncertain
river
a
glorious
mould
of
fading
clay
from
whence
the
spark
had
fled
forever
i
gazed
my
heart
was
like
to
burst
and
as
i
thought
of
years
departed
the
years
wherein
i
saw
her
first
when
she
a
girl
was
and
as
i
mused
on
later
days
when
moved
she
in
her
matron
duty
a
happy
mother
in
the
blaze
of
ripened
hope
and
sunny
beauty
i
felt
the
chill
i
turned
aside
bleak
desolation
cloud
came
me
and
being
seemed
a
troubled
tide
whose
wrecks
in
darkness
swam
before
me
macbeth
qua
cursum
ventus
as
ships
becalmed
at
eve
that
lay
with
canvas
drooping
side
by
side
two
towers
of
sail
at
dawn
of
day
are
scarce
long
leagues
apart
descried
when
fell
the
night
upsprung
the
breeze
and
all
the
darkling
hours
they
plied
nor
dreamt
but
each
the
selfsame
seas
by
each
was
cleaving
side
by
side
so
but
why
the
tale
reveal
of
those
whom
year
by
year
unchanged
brief
absence
joined
anew
to
feel
astounded
soul
from
soul
estranged
at
dead
of
night
their
sails
were
filled
and
onward
each
rejoicing
steered
ah
neither
blame
for
neither
willed
or
wist
what
first
with
dawn
appeared
to
veer
how
vain
on
onward
strain
brave
barks
in
light
in
darkness
too
through
winds
and
tides
one
compass
guides
to
that
and
your
own
selves
be
true
but
o
blithe
breeze
and
o
great
seas
though
that
earliest
parting
past
on
your
wide
plain
they
join
again
together
lead
them
home
at
last
one
port
methought
alike
they
sought
one
purpose
hold
they
fare
o
bounding
breeze
o
rushing
seas
at
last
at
last
unite
them
there
hugh
changes
whom
first
we
love
you
know
we
seldom
time
rules
us
all
and
life
indeed
is
not
the
thing
we
planned
it
out
ere
hope
was
dead
and
then
we
women
can
not
choose
our
lot
much
must
be
borne
which
it
is
hard
to
bear
much
given
away
which
it
were
sweet
to
keep
god
help
us
all
who
need
indeed
his
care
and
yet
i
know
the
shepherd
loves
his
sheep
my
little
boy
begins
to
babble
now
upon
my
knee
his
earliest
infant
prayer
he
has
his
father
eager
eyes
i
know
and
they
say
too
his
mother
sunny
hair
but
when
he
sleeps
and
smiles
upon
my
knee
and
i
can
feel
his
light
breath
come
and
go
i
think
of
one
heaven
help
and
pity
me
who
loved
me
and
whom
i
loved
long
ago
who
might
have
been
ah
what
i
dare
not
think
we
are
all
changed
god
judges
for
us
best
god
help
us
do
our
duty
and
not
shrink
and
trust
in
heaven
humbly
for
the
rest
but
blame
us
women
not
if
some
appear
too
cold
at
times
and
some
too
gay
and
light
some
griefs
gnaw
deep
some
woes
are
hard
to
bear
who
knows
the
past
and
who
can
judge
us
right
ah
were
we
judged
by
what
we
might
have
been
and
not
by
what
we
are
too
apt
to
fall
my
little
child
he
sleeps
and
smiles
between
these
thoughts
and
me
in
heaven
we
shall
know
all
bulwer
i
remember
i
remember
i
remember
i
remember
the
house
where
i
was
born
the
little
window
where
the
sun
came
peeping
in
at
morn
he
never
came
a
wink
too
soon
nor
brought
too
long
a
day
but
now
i
often
wish
the
night
had
borne
my
breath
away
i
remember
i
remember
the
roses
red
and
white
the
violets
and
the
those
flowers
made
of
light
the
lilacs
where
the
robin
built
and
where
my
brother
set
the
laburnum
on
his
birthday
the
tree
is
living
yet
i
remember
i
remember
where
i
was
used
to
swing
and
thought
the
air
must
rush
as
fresh
to
swallows
on
the
wing
my
spirit
flew
in
feathers
then
that
is
so
heavy
now
and
summer
pool
could
hardly
cool
the
fever
on
my
brow
i
remember
i
remember
the
dark
and
high
i
used
to
think
their
slender
tops
were
close
against
the
sky
it
was
a
childish
ignorance
but
now
is
little
joy
to
know
i
farther
off
from
heaven
than
when
i
was
a
boy
haunted
houses
all
houses
wherein
men
have
lived
and
died
are
haunted
houses
through
the
open
doors
the
harmless
phantoms
on
their
errands
glide
with
feet
that
make
no
sound
upon
the
floors
we
meet
them
at
the
doorway
on
the
stair
along
the
passages
they
come
and
go
impalpable
impressions
on
the
air
a
sense
of
something
moving
to
and
fro
there
are
more
guests
at
table
than
the
hosts
invited
the
illuminated
hall
is
thronged
with
quiet
inoffensive
ghosts
as
silent
as
the
pictures
on
the
wall
the
stranger
at
my
fireside
can
not
see
the
forms
i
see
nor
hear
the
sounds
i
hear
he
but
perceives
what
is
while
unto
me
all
that
has
been
is
visible
and
clear
we
have
no
to
house
or
lands
owners
and
occupants
of
earlier
dates
from
graves
forgotten
stretch
their
dusty
hands
and
hold
in
mortmain
still
their
old
estates
the
around
this
world
of
sense
floats
like
an
atmosphere
and
everywhere
wafts
through
these
earthly
mists
and
vapors
dense
a
vital
breath
of
more
ethereal
air
our
little
lives
are
kept
in
equipoise
by
opposite
attractions
and
desires
the
struggle
of
the
instinct
that
enjoys
and
the
more
noble
instinct
that
aspires
these
perturbations
this
perpetual
jar
of
earthly
wants
and
aspirations
high
come
from
the
influence
of
an
unseen
star
an
undiscovered
planet
in
our
sky
and
as
the
moon
from
some
dark
gate
of
cloud
throws
the
sea
a
floating
bridge
of
light
across
whose
trembling
planks
our
fancies
crowd
into
the
realm
of
mystery
and
night
so
from
the
world
of
spirits
there
descends
a
bridge
of
light
connecting
it
with
this
whose
unsteady
floor
that
sways
and
bends
wander
our
thoughts
above
the
dark
abyss
wadsworth
thanatopsis
to
him
who
in
the
love
of
nature
holds
communion
with
her
visible
forms
she
speaks
a
various
language
for
his
gayer
hours
she
has
a
voice
of
gladness
and
a
smile
and
eloquence
of
beauty
and
she
glides
into
his
darker
musings
with
a
mild
and
healing
sympathy
that
steals
away
their
sharpness
ere
he
is
aware
when
thoughts
of
the
last
bitter
hour
come
like
a
blight
over
thy
spirit
and
sad
images
of
the
stern
agony
and
shroud
and
pall
and
breathless
darkness
and
the
narrow
house
make
thee
to
shudder
and
grow
sick
at
heart
go
forth
under
the
open
sky
and
list
to
nature
teachings
while
from
all
around
earth
and
her
waters
and
the
depths
of
air
comes
a
still
voice
yet
a
few
days
and
thee
the
sun
shall
see
no
more
in
all
his
course
nor
yet
in
the
cold
ground
where
thy
pale
form
was
laid
with
many
tears
nor
in
the
embrace
of
ocean
shall
exist
thy
image
earth
that
nourished
thee
shall
claim
thy
growth
to
be
resolved
to
earth
again
and
lost
each
human
trace
surrendering
up
thine
individual
being
shalt
thou
go
to
mix
forever
with
the
elements
to
be
a
brother
to
the
insensible
rock
and
to
the
sluggish
clod
which
the
rude
swain
turns
with
his
share
and
treads
upon
the
oak
shall
send
his
roots
abroad
and
pierce
thy
mould
yet
not
to
thine
eternal
shalt
thou
retire
alone
nor
couldst
thou
wish
couch
more
magnificent
thou
shalt
lie
down
with
patriarchs
of
the
infant
world
with
kings
the
powerful
of
the
earth
the
wise
the
good
fair
forms
and
hoary
seers
of
ages
past
all
in
one
mighty
sepulchre
the
hills
and
ancient
as
the
sun
the
vales
stretching
in
pensive
quietness
between
the
venerable
woods
rivers
that
move
in
majesty
and
the
complaining
brooks
that
make
the
meadows
green
and
poured
round
all
old
ocean
gray
and
melancholy
waste
are
but
the
solemn
decorations
all
of
the
great
tomb
of
man
the
golden
sun
the
planets
all
the
infinite
host
of
heaven
are
shining
on
the
sad
abodes
of
death
through
the
still
lapse
of
ages
all
that
tread
the
globe
are
but
a
handful
to
the
tribes
that
slumber
in
its
bosom
take
the
wings
of
morning
traverse
barca
desert
sands
or
lose
thyself
in
the
continuous
woods
where
rolls
the
oregon
and
hears
no
sound
save
his
own
dashings
yet
the
dead
are
there
and
millions
in
those
solitudes
since
first
the
flight
of
years
began
have
laid
them
down
in
their
last
sleep
the
dead
reign
there
alone
so
shalt
thou
rest
and
what
if
thou
withdraw
in
silence
from
the
living
and
no
friend
take
note
of
thy
departure
all
that
breathe
will
share
thy
destiny
the
gay
will
laugh
when
thou
art
gone
the
solemn
brood
of
care
plod
on
and
each
one
as
before
will
chase
his
favorite
phantom
yet
all
these
shall
leave
their
mirth
and
their
employments
and
shall
come
and
make
their
bed
with
thee
as
the
long
train
of
ages
glide
away
the
sons
of
men
the
youth
in
life
green
spring
and
he
who
goes
in
the
full
strength
of
years
matron
and
maid
and
the
sweet
babe
and
the
man
shall
one
by
one
be
gathered
to
thy
side
by
those
who
in
their
turn
shall
follow
them
so
live
that
when
thy
summons
comes
to
join
the
innumerable
caravan
which
moves
to
that
mysterious
realm
where
each
shall
take
his
chamber
in
the
silent
halls
of
death
thou
go
not
like
the
at
night
scourged
to
his
dungeon
but
sustained
and
soothed
by
an
unfaltering
trust
approach
thy
grave
like
one
who
wraps
the
drapery
of
his
couch
about
him
and
lies
down
to
pleasant
dreams
cullen
over
the
river
over
the
river
they
beckon
to
me
loved
ones
who
crossed
to
the
farther
side
the
gleam
of
their
snowy
robes
i
see
but
their
voices
are
lost
in
the
dashing
tide
there
one
with
ringlets
of
sunny
gold
and
eyes
the
reflection
of
heaven
own
blue
he
crossed
in
the
twilight
gray
and
cold
and
the
pale
mist
hid
him
from
mortal
view
we
saw
not
the
angels
who
met
him
there
the
gates
of
the
city
we
could
not
see
over
the
river
over
the
river
my
brother
stands
waiting
to
welcome
me
over
the
river
the
boatman
pale
carried
another
the
household
pet
her
brown
curls
waved
in
the
gentle
gale
darling
minnie
i
see
her
yet
she
crossed
on
her
bosom
her
dimpled
hands
and
fearlessly
entered
the
phantom
bark
we
felt
it
glide
from
the
silver
sands
and
all
our
sunshine
grew
strangely
dark
we
know
she
is
safe
on
the
farther
side
where
all
the
ransomed
and
angels
be
over
the
river
the
mystic
river
my
childhood
idol
is
waiting
for
me
for
none
return
from
those
quiet
shores
who
cross
with
the
boatman
cold
and
pale
we
hear
the
dip
of
the
golden
oars
and
catch
a
gleam
of
the
snowy
sail
and
lo
they
have
passed
from
our
yearning
heart
they
cross
the
stream
and
are
gone
for
aye
we
may
not
sunder
the
veil
apart
that
hides
from
our
vision
the
gates
of
day
we
only
know
that
their
barks
no
more
may
sail
with
us
life
stormy
sea
yet
somewhere
i
know
on
the
unseen
shore
they
watch
and
beckon
and
wait
for
me
and
i
sit
and
think
when
the
sunset
gold
is
flushing
river
and
hill
and
shore
i
shall
one
day
stand
by
the
water
cold
and
list
for
the
sound
of
the
boatman
oar
i
shall
watch
for
a
gleam
of
the
flapping
sail
i
shall
hear
the
boat
as
it
gains
the
strand
i
shall
pass
from
sight
with
the
boatman
pale
to
the
better
shore
of
the
i
shall
know
the
loved
who
have
gone
before
and
joyfully
sweet
will
the
meeting
be
when
over
the
river
the
peaceful
river
the
angel
of
death
shall
carry
me
priest
they
are
all
gone
they
are
all
gone
into
the
world
of
light
and
i
alone
sit
lingering
here
their
very
memory
is
fair
and
bright
and
my
sad
thoughts
doth
clear
it
glows
and
glitters
in
my
cloudy
breast
like
stars
upon
some
gloomy
grove
or
those
faint
beams
in
which
this
hill
is
dressed
after
the
sun
remove
i
see
them
walking
in
an
air
of
glory
whose
light
doth
trample
on
my
days
my
days
which
are
at
best
but
dull
and
hoary
mere
glimmerings
and
decays
o
holy
hope
and
high
humility
high
as
the
heavens
above
these
are
your
walks
and
you
have
showed
them
me
to
kindle
my
cold
love
dear
beauteous
death
the
jewel
of
the
just
shining
nowhere
but
in
the
dark
what
mysteries
do
lie
beyond
thy
dust
could
man
outlook
that
mark
he
that
hath
found
some
fledged
bird
nest
may
know
at
first
sight
if
the
bird
be
flown
but
what
fair
dell
or
grove
he
sings
in
now
that
is
to
him
unknown
and
yet
as
angels
in
some
brighter
dreams
call
to
the
soul
when
man
doth
sleep
so
some
strange
thoughts
transcend
our
wonted
themes
and
into
glory
peep
if
a
star
were
confined
into
a
tomb
her
captive
flames
must
needs
burn
there
but
when
the
hand
that
locked
her
up
gives
room
she
shine
through
all
the
sphere
o
father
of
eternal
life
and
all
created
glories
under
thee
resume
thy
spirit
from
this
world
of
thrall
into
true
liberty
either
disperse
these
mists
which
blot
and
fill
my
perspective
still
as
they
pass
or
else
remove
me
hence
unto
that
hill
where
i
shall
need
no
glass
the
river
path
no
floated
down
the
hill
the
tangled
bank
below
was
still
no
rustle
from
the
birchen
stem
no
ripple
from
the
water
hem
the
dusk
of
twilight
round
us
grew
we
felt
the
falling
of
the
dew
for
from
us
ere
the
day
was
done
the
wooded
hills
shut
out
the
sun
but
on
the
river
farther
side
we
saw
the
glorified
a
tender
glow
exceeding
fair
a
dream
of
day
without
its
glare
with
us
the
damp
the
chill
the
gloom
with
them
the
sunset
rosy
bloom
while
dark
through
willowy
vistas
seen
the
river
rolled
in
shade
between
from
out
the
darkness
where
we
trod
we
gazed
upon
those
hills
of
god
whose
light
seemed
not
of
morn
or
sun
we
spake
not
but
our
thought
was
one
we
paused
as
if
from
that
bright
shore
beckoned
our
dear
ones
gone
before
and
stilled
our
beating
hearts
to
hear
the
voices
lost
to
mortal
ear
sudden
our
pathway
turned
from
night
the
hills
swung
open
to
the
light
through
their
green
gates
the
sunshine
showed
a
long
slant
splendor
downward
flowed
down
glade
and
glen
and
bank
it
rolled
it
bridged
the
shaded
stream
with
gold
and
borne
on
piers
of
mist
allied
the
shadowy
with
the
sunlit
side
so
prayed
we
when
our
feet
draw
near
the
river
dark
with
mortal
fear
and
the
night
cometh
chill
with
dew
o
father
let
thy
light
break
through
so
let
the
hills
of
doubt
divide
to
bridge
with
faith
the
sunless
tide
so
let
the
eyes
that
fail
on
earth
on
thy
eternal
hills
look
forth
and
in
thy
beckoning
angels
know
the
dear
ones
whom
we
loved
below
greenleaf
an
old
man
idyl
by
the
waters
of
life
we
sat
together
hand
in
hand
in
the
golden
days
of
the
beautiful
early
summer
weather
when
hours
were
anthems
and
speech
was
praise
when
the
heart
kept
time
to
the
carol
of
birds
and
the
birds
kept
tune
to
the
songs
that
ran
through
shimmer
of
flowers
on
grassy
swards
and
trees
with
voices
æolian
by
the
rivers
of
life
we
walked
together
i
and
my
darling
unafraid
and
lighter
than
any
linnet
feather
the
burdens
of
being
on
us
weighed
and
love
sweet
miracles
us
threw
mantles
of
joy
outlasting
time
and
up
from
the
rosy
morrows
grew
a
sound
that
seemed
like
a
in
the
gardens
of
life
we
roamed
together
and
the
luscious
apples
were
ripe
and
red
and
the
languid
lilac
and
honeyed
heather
swooned
with
the
fragrance
which
they
shed
and
under
the
trees
the
angels
walked
and
up
in
the
air
a
sense
of
wings
awed
us
sacredly
while
we
talked
softly
in
tender
communings
in
the
meadows
of
life
we
strayed
together
watching
the
waving
harvests
grow
and
under
the
benison
of
the
father
our
hearts
like
the
lambs
skipped
to
and
fro
and
the
cowslips
hearing
our
low
replies
broidered
fairer
the
emerald
banks
and
glad
tears
shone
in
the
daisies
eyes
and
the
timid
violet
glistened
thanks
who
was
with
us
and
what
was
round
us
neither
myself
nor
darling
guessed
only
we
knew
that
something
crowned
us
out
from
the
heavens
with
crowns
of
rest
only
we
knew
that
something
bright
lingered
lovingly
where
we
stood
clothed
with
the
incandescent
light
of
something
higher
than
humanhood
o
the
riches
love
doth
inherit
ah
the
alchemy
which
doth
change
dross
of
body
and
dregs
of
spirit
into
sanctities
rare
and
strange
my
flesh
is
feeble
and
dry
and
old
my
darling
beautiful
hair
is
gray
but
our
elixir
and
precious
gold
laugh
at
the
footsteps
of
decay
harms
of
the
world
have
come
upon
us
cups
of
sorrow
we
yet
shall
drain
but
we
have
a
secret
which
doth
show
us
wonderful
rainbows
through
the
rain
and
we
hear
the
tread
of
the
years
go
by
and
the
sun
is
setting
behind
the
hills
but
my
darling
does
not
fear
to
die
and
i
am
happy
in
what
god
wills
so
we
sit
by
our
household
fires
together
dreaming
the
dreams
of
long
ago
then
it
was
balmy
summer
weather
and
now
the
valleys
are
laid
in
snow
icicles
hang
from
the
slippery
eaves
the
wind
grows
cold
it
is
growing
late
well
well
we
have
garnered
all
our
sheaves
i
and
my
darling
and
we
wait
betrothed
anew
the
sunlight
fills
the
trembling
air
and
balmy
days
their
guerdons
bring
the
earth
again
is
young
and
fair
and
amorous
with
musky
spring
the
golden
nurslings
of
the
may
in
splendor
strew
the
spangled
green
and
hues
of
tender
beauty
play
entangled
where
the
willows
lean
mark
how
the
rippled
currents
flow
what
lustres
on
the
meadows
lie
and
hark
the
songsters
come
and
go
and
trill
between
the
earth
and
sky
who
told
us
that
the
years
had
fled
or
borne
afar
our
blissful
youth
such
joys
are
all
about
us
spread
we
know
the
whisper
was
not
truth
the
birds
that
break
from
grass
and
grove
sing
every
carol
that
they
sung
when
first
our
veins
were
rich
with
love
and
may
her
mantle
round
us
flung
o
dawn
immortal
life
o
earth
betrothal
sweet
and
true
with
whose
delights
our
souls
are
rife
and
aye
their
vernal
vows
renew
then
darling
walk
with
me
this
morn
let
your
brown
tresses
drink
its
sheen
these
violets
within
them
worn
of
floral
fays
shall
make
you
queen
what
though
there
comes
a
time
of
pain
when
autumn
winds
forebode
decay
the
days
of
love
are
born
again
that
fabled
time
is
far
away
and
never
seemed
the
land
so
fair
as
now
nor
birds
such
notes
to
sing
since
first
within
your
shining
hair
i
wove
the
blossoms
of
the
spring
clarence
the
eyes
which
can
but
ill
define
shapes
that
rise
about
and
near
through
the
far
horizon
line
stretch
a
vision
free
and
clear
memories
feeble
to
retrace
yesterday
immediate
flow
find
a
dear
familiar
face
in
each
hour
of
follow
yon
majestic
train
down
the
slopes
of
old
renown
knightly
forms
without
disdain
sainted
heads
without
a
frown
emperors
of
thought
and
hand
congregate
a
glorious
show
met
from
every
age
and
land
in
the
plains
of
as
the
heart
of
childhood
brings
something
of
eternal
joy
from
its
own
unsounded
springs
such
as
life
can
scarce
destroy
so
remindful
of
the
prime
spirits
wandering
to
and
fro
rest
upon
the
in
the
peace
of
youthful
hope
religious
fire
when
it
burns
no
longer
leaves
ashes
of
impure
desire
on
the
altars
it
bereaves
but
the
light
that
fills
the
past
sheds
a
still
diviner
glow
ever
farther
it
is
cast
the
scenes
of
many
a
growth
of
pain
and
care
cumbering
all
the
present
hour
yields
when
once
transplanted
there
healthy
fruit
or
pleasant
flower
thoughts
that
hardly
flourish
here
feelings
long
have
ceased
to
blow
breathe
a
native
atmosphere
in
the
world
of
on
that
shore
frequent
pearls
of
beauty
lie
where
the
of
yore
fiercely
beat
and
mounted
high
sorrows

is
a
fearful
night
in
the
winter
time
as
cold
as
it
ever
can
be
the
roar
of
the
blast
is
heard
like
the
chime
of
the
waves
on
an
angry
sea
the
moon
is
full
but
her
silver
light
the
storm
dashes
out
with
its
wings
and
over
the
sky
from
south
to
north
not
a
star
is
seen
as
the
wind
comes
forth
in
the
strength
of
a
mighty
glee
ii
all
day
had
the
snow
come
down
all
day
as
it
never
came
down
before
and
over
the
hills
at
sunset
lay
some
two
or
three
feet
or
more
the
fence
was
lost
and
the
wall
of
stone
the
windows
blocked
and
the
gone
the
haystack
had
grown
to
a
mountain
lift
and
the
looked
like
a
monster
drift
as
it
lay
by
the
farmer
door
the
night
sets
in
on
a
world
of
snow
while
the
air
grows
sharp
and
chill
and
the
warning
roar
of
a
fearful
blow
is
heard
on
the
distant
hill
and
the
norther
see
on
the
mountain
peak
in
his
breath
how
the
old
trees
writhe
and
shriek
he
shouts
on
the
plain
he
drives
from
his
nostrils
the
blinding
snow
and
growls
with
a
savage
will
iii
such
a
night
as
this
to
be
found
abroad
in
the
drifts
and
the
freezing
air
sits
a
shivering
dog
in
the
field
by
the
road
with
the
snow
in
his
shaggy
hair
he
shuts
his
eyes
to
the
wind
and
growls
he
lifts
his
head
and
moans
and
howls
then
crouching
low
from
the
cutting
sleet
his
nose
is
pressed
on
his
quivering
feet
pray
what
does
the
dog
do
there
a
farmer
came
from
the
village
plain
but
he
lost
the
travelled
way
and
for
hours
he
trod
with
might
and
main
a
path
for
his
horse
and
sleigh
but
colder
still
the
cold
winds
blew
and
deeper
still
the
deep
drifts
grew
and
his
mare
a
beautiful
morgan
brown
at
last
in
her
struggles
floundered
down
where
a
log
in
a
hollow
lay
in
vain
with
a
neigh
and
a
frenzied
snort
she
plunged
in
the
drifting
snow
while
her
master
urged
till
his
breath
grew
short
with
a
word
and
a
gentle
blow
but
the
snow
was
deep
and
the
tugs
were
tight
his
hands
were
numb
and
had
lost
their
might
so
he
wallowed
back
to
his
sleigh
and
strove
to
shelter
himself
till
day
with
his
coat
and
the
buffalo
iv
he
has
given
the
last
faint
jerk
of
the
rein
to
rouse
up
his
dying
steed
and
the
poor
dog
howls
to
the
blast
in
vain
for
help
in
his
master
need
for
a
while
he
strives
with
a
wistful
cry
to
catch
a
glance
from
his
drowsy
eye
and
wags
his
tail
if
the
rude
winds
flap
the
skirt
of
the
buffalo
over
his
lap
and
whines
when
he
takes
no
heed
the
wind
goes
down
and
the
storm
is
is
the
hour
of
midnight
past
the
old
trees
writhe
and
bend
no
more
in
the
whirl
of
the
rushing
blast
the
silent
moon
with
her
peaceful
light
looks
down
on
the
hills
with
snow
all
white
and
the
giant
shadow
of
camel
hump
the
blasted
pine
and
the
ghostly
stump
afar
on
the
plain
are
cast
but
cold
and
dead
by
the
hidden
log
are
they
who
came
from
the
town
the
man
in
his
sleigh
and
his
faithful
dog
and
his
beautiful
morgan
brown
in
the
wide
far
and
grand
with
his
cap
on
his
head
and
the
reins
in
his
hand
the
dog
with
his
nose
on
his
master
feet
and
the
mare
half
seen
through
the
crusted
sleet
where
she
lay
when
she
floundered
down
gamage
the
death
of
the
flowers
the
melancholy
days
are
come
the
saddest
of
the
year
of
wailing
winds
and
naked
woods
and
meadows
brown
and
sear
heaped
in
the
hollows
of
the
grove
the
autumn
leaves
lie
dead
they
rustle
to
the
eddying
gust
and
to
the
rabbit
tread
the
robin
and
the
wren
are
flown
and
from
the
shrubs
the
jay
and
from
the
calls
the
crow
through
all
the
gloomy
day
where
are
the
flowers
the
fair
young
flowers
that
lately
sprang
and
stood
in
brighter
light
and
softer
airs
a
beauteous
sisterhood
alas
they
all
are
in
their
graves
the
gentle
race
of
flowers
are
lying
in
their
lowly
beds
with
the
fair
and
good
of
ours
the
rain
is
falling
where
they
lie
but
the
cold
november
rain
calls
not
from
out
the
gloomy
earth
the
lovely
ones
again
the
and
the
violet
they
perished
long
ago
and
the
and
the
orchis
died
amid
the
summer
glow
but
on
the
hill
the
and
the
aster
in
the
wood
and
the
yellow
sunflower
by
the
brook
in
autumn
beauty
stood
till
fell
the
frost
from
the
clear
cold
heaven
as
falls
the
plague
on
men
and
the
brightness
of
their
smile
was
gone
from
upland
glade
and
glen
and
now
when
comes
the
calm
mild
day
as
still
such
days
will
come
to
call
the
squirrel
and
the
bee
from
out
their
winter
home
when
the
sound
of
dropping
nuts
is
heard
though
all
the
trees
are
still
and
twinkle
in
the
smoky
light
the
waters
of
the
rill
the
searches
for
the
flowers
whose
fragrance
late
he
bore
and
sighs
to
find
them
in
the
wood
and
by
the
stream
no
more
and
then
i
think
of
one
who
in
her
youthful
beauty
died
the
fair
meek
blossom
that
grew
up
and
faded
by
my
side
in
the
cold
moist
earth
we
laid
her
when
the
forests
cast
the
leaf
and
we
wept
that
one
so
lovely
should
have
a
life
so
brief
yet
not
unmeet
it
was
that
one
like
that
young
friend
of
ours
so
gentle
and
so
beautiful
should
perish
with
the
flowers
cullen
the
sands
of
dee
o
mary
go
and
call
the
cattle
home
and
call
the
cattle
home
and
call
the
cattle
home
across
the
sands
of
dee
the
western
wind
was
wild
and
dank
with
foam
and
all
alone
went
she
the
western
tide
crept
up
along
the
sand
and
and
the
sand
and
round
and
round
the
sand
as
far
as
eye
could
see
the
rolling
mist
came
down
and
hid
the
land
and
never
home
came
she
oh
is
it
weed
or
fish
or
floating
hair
a
tress
of
golden
hair
a
drownéd
maiden
hair
above
the
nets
at
sea
was
never
salmon
yet
that
shone
so
fair
among
the
stakes
on
dee
they
rowed
her
in
across
the
rolling
foam
the
cruel
crawling
foam
the
cruel
hungry
foam
to
her
grave
beside
the
sea
but
still
the
boatmen
hear
her
call
the
cattle
home
across
the
sands
of
dee
hymn
to
the
night
i
heard
the
trailing
garments
of
the
night
sweep
through
her
marble
halls
i
saw
her
sable
skirts
all
fringed
with
light
from
the
celestial
walls
i
felt
her
presence
by
its
spell
of
might
stoop
me
from
above
the
calm
majestic
presence
of
the
night
as
of
the
one
i
love
i
heard
the
sounds
of
sorrow
and
delight
the
manifold
soft
chimes
that
fill
the
haunted
chambers
of
the
night
like
some
old
poet
rhymes
from
the
cool
cisterns
of
the
midnight
air
my
spirit
drank
repose
the
fountain
of
perpetual
peace
flows
there
from
those
deep
cisterns
flows
o
holy
night
from
thee
i
learn
to
bear
what
man
has
borne
before
thou
layest
thy
finger
on
the
lips
of
care
and
they
complain
no
more
peace
peace
i
breathe
this
prayer

with
flight
the
welcome

the
most
fair

wadsworth
night
and
death
mysterious
night
when
our
first
parent
knew
thee
from
report
divine
and
heard
thy
name
did
he
not
tremble
for
this
lovely
frame
this
glorious

of
light

concealed
within
thy
beams

who
could

stood
revealed
that
to
such
countless
orbs

like
an
embodied
joy
whose
race
is
just
begun
the
pale
purple
even
melts
around
thy
flight
like
a
star
of
heaven
in
the
broad
daylight
thou
art
unseen
but
yet
i
hear
thy
shrill
delight
keen
as
are
the
arrows
of
that
silver
sphere
whose
intense
lamp
narrows
in
the
white
dawn
clear
until
we
hardly
see
we
feel
that
it
is
there
all
the
earth
and
air
with
thy
voice
is
loud
as
when
night
is
bare
from
one
lonely
cloud
the
moon
rains
out
her
beams
and
heaven
is
overflowed
what
thou
art
we
know
not
what
is
most
like
thee
from
rainbow
clouds
there
flow
not
drops
so
bright
to
see
as
from
thy
presence
showers
a
rain
of
melody
like
a
poet
hidden
in
the
light
of
thought
singing
hymns
unbidden
till
the
world
is
wrought
to
sympathy
with
hopes
and
fears
it
heeded
not
like
a
maiden
in
a
palace
tower
soothing
her
soul
in
secret
hour
with
music
sweet
as
love
which
overflows
her
bower
like
a
golden
in
a
dell
of
dew
scattering
unbeholden
its
aerial
hue
among
the
flowers
and
grass
which
screen
it
from
the
view
like
a
rose
embowered
in
its
own
green
leaves
by
warm
winds
deflowered
till
the
scent
it
gives
makes
faint
with
too
much
sweet
these
thieves
sound
of
vernal
showers
on
the
twinkling
grass
flowers
all
that
ever
was
joyous
and
fresh
and
clear
thy
music
doth
surpass
teach
us
sprite
or
bird
what
sweet
thoughts
are
thine
i
have
never
heard
praise
of
love
or
wine
that
panted
forth
a
flood
of
rapture
so
divine
chorus
hymeneal
or
triumphant
chant
matched
with
thine
would
be
all
but
an
empty
vaunt
a
thing
wherein
we
feel
there
is
some
hidden
want
what
objects
are
the
fountains
of
thy
happy
strain
what
fields
or
waves
or
mountains
what
shapes
of
sky
or
plain
what
love
of
thine
own
kind
what
ignorance
of
pain
with
thy
clear
keen
joyance
languor
can
not
be
shadow
of
annoyance
never
came
near
thee
thou
lovest
but
knew
love
sad
satiety
waking
or
asleep
thou
of
death
must
deem
things
more
true
and
deep
than
we
mortals
dream
or
how
could
thy
notes
flow
in
such
a
crystal
stream
we
look
before
and
after
and
pine
for
what
is
not
our
sincerest
laughter
with
some
pain
is
fraught
our
sweetest
songs
are
those
that
tell
of
saddest
thought
yet
if
we
could
scorn
hate
and
pride
and
fear
if
we
were
things
born
not
to
shed
a
tear
i
know
not
how
thy
joy
we
ever
could
come
near
better
than
all
measures
of
delight
and
sound
better
than
all
treasures
that
in
books
are
found
thy
skill
to
poet
were
thou
scorner
of
the
ground
teach
me
half
the
gladness
that
thy
brain
must
know
such
harmonious
madness
from
my
lips
would
flow
the
world
should
listen
then
as
i
am
listening
now
bysshe
to

my
boat
is
on
the
shore
and
my
bark
is
on
the
sea
but
before
i
go
tom

here
a
double
health
to
thee
here
a
sigh
for
those
that
love
me
and
a
smile
for
those
who
hate
and
whatever
sky
above
me
here
a
heart
for
every
fate
though
the
ocean
roar
around
me
yet
it
still
shall
bear
me
on
though
a
desert
should
surround
me
it
hath
springs
that
may
be
won
were
the
last
drop
in
the
well
as
i
gasped
upon
the
brink
ere
my
fainting
spirit
fell
is
to
thee
that
i
would
drink
with
that
water
as
this
wine
the
libation
i
would
pour
should
be
peace
with
thine
and

the
last
rose
of
summer
is
the
last
rose
of
summer
left
blooming
alone
all
her
lovely
companions
are
faded
and
gone
no
flower
of
her
kindred
no
rosebud
is
nigh
to
reflect
back
her
blushes
or
give
sigh
for
sigh
i
not
leave
thee
thou
lone
one
to
pine
on
the
stem
since
the
lovely
are
sleeping
go
sleep
thou
with
them
thus
kindly
i
scatter
thy
leaves
the
bed
where
thy
mates
of
the
garden
lie
scentless
and
dead
so
soon
may
i
follow
when
friendships
decay
and
from
love
shining
circle
the
gems
drop
away
when
true
hearts
lie
withered
and
fond
ones
are
flown
o
who
would
inhabit
this
bleak
world
alone
a
farewell
flow
down
cold
rivulet
to
the
sea
thy
tribute
wave
deliver
no
more
by
thee
my
steps
shall
be
forever
and
forever
flow
softly
flow
by
lawn
and
lea
a
rivulet
then
a
river
nowhere
by
thee
my
steps
shall
be
forever
and
forever
but
here
will
sigh
thine
and
here
thine
aspen
shiver
and
here
by
thee
will
hum
the
bee
forever
and
forever
a
thousand
suns
will
stream
on
thee
a
thousand
moons
will
quiver
but
not
by
thee
my
steps
shall
be

my
life
is
like
the
summer
rose
that
opens
to
the
morning
sky
but
ere
the
shades
of
evening
close
is
scattered
on
the
ground
to
die
yet
on
the
rose
humble
bed
the
sweetest
dews
of
night
are
shed
as
if
she
wept
the
waste
to
see
but
none
shall
weep
a
tear
for
me
my
life
is
like
the
autumn
leaf
that
trembles
in
the
moon
pale
ray
its
hold
is
frail
its
date
is
brief
restless
and
soon
to
pass
away
yet
ere
that
leaf
shall
fall
and
fade
the
parent
tree
will
mourn
its
shade
the
winds
bewail
the
leafless
tree
but
none
shall
breathe
a
sigh
for
me
my
life
is
like
the
prints
which
feet
have
left
on
tampa
desert
strand
soon
as
the
rising
tide
shall
beat
all
trace
will
vanish
from
the
sand
yet
as
if
grieving
to
efface
all
vestige
of
the
human
race
on
that
lone
shore
loud
moans
the
sea
but
none
alas
shall
mourn
for
me
henry
the
little
years
these
years
these
years
these
naughty
years
once
they
were
pretty
things
their
fairy
footfalls
met
our
ears
our
eyes
their
glancing
wings
they
flitted
by
our
way
we
chased
the
little
imps
at
play
we
knew
them
soon
for
tricksy
elves
they
brought
the
college
gown
with
thoughtful
books
filled
up
our
shelves
darkened
our
lips
with
down
played
with
our
throat
and
lo
the
tone
of
manhood
had
become
our
own
they
smiling
stretched
our
childish
size
their
soft
hands
trimmed
our
hair
cast
the
deep
thought
within
our
eyes
and
left
it
glowing
there
sang
songs
of
hope
in
college
halls
bright
fancies
drew
upon
the
walls
they
flashed
upon
us
love
bright
gem
they
showed
us
gleams
of
fame
work
we
learned
from
them
and
honor
more
than
name
and
so
they
came
and
went
away
we
said
not
go
we
said
not
stay
but
one
sweet
day
when
quiet
skies
and
still
leaves
brought
me
thought
when
hazy
hills
drew
forth
my
eyes
and
woods
with
deep
shade
fraught
that
day
i
carelessly
found
out
what
work
these
elves
had
been
about
alas
those
little
rogues
the
years
had
fooled
me
many
a
day
plucked
half
the
locks
above
my
ears
and
tinged
the
rest
all
gray
they
left
me
wrinkles
great
and
small
i
fear
that
they
have
tricked
us
all
well
give
the
little
years
their
way
think
speak
and
act
the
while
lift
up
the
bare
front
to
the
day
and
make
their
wrinkles
smile
they
mould
the
noblest
living
head
they
carve
the
best
tomb
for
the
dead

age
of
wisdom

at

once
before

he
passed
by

say
that
in

the
of

cut
him
down
not
a
better
man
was
found
by
the
crier
on
his
round
through
the
town
but
now
he
walks
the
streets
and
he
looks
at
all
he
meets
sad
and
wan
and
he
shakes
his
feeble
head
that
it
seems
as
if
he
said
they
are
gone
the
mossy
marbles
rest
on
the
lips
that
he
has
pressed
in
their
bloom
and
the
names
he
loved
to
hear
have
been
carved
for
many
a
year
on
the
tomb
my
grandmamma
has
said
poor
old
lady
she
is
dead
long
ago
that
he
had
a
roman
nose
and
his
cheek
was
like
a
rose
in
the
snow
but
now
his
nose
is
thin
and
it
rests
upon
his
chin
like
a
staff
and
a
crook
is
in
his
back
and
a
melancholy
crack
in
his
laugh
i
know
it
is
a
sin
for
me
to
sit
and
grin
at
him
here
but
the
old
hat
and
the
breeches
and
all
that
are
so
queer
and
if
i
should
live
to
be
the
last
leaf
upon
the
tree
in
the
spring
let
them
smile
as
i
do
now
at
the
old
forsaken
bough

may
not
dare

fancy
now
the
grief
that
clouds
thy
lovely
brow
i
dare
not
think
upon
thy
vow
and
all
it
promised
me
mary
no
fond
regret
must
norman
know
when
bursts
on
the
foe
his
heart
must
be
like
bended
bow
his
foot
like
arrow
free
mary
a
time
will
come
with
feeling
fraught
for
if
i
fall
in
battle
fought
thy
hapless
lover
dying
thought
shall
be
a
thought
on
thee
mary
and
if
returned
from
conquered
foes
how
blithely
will
the
evening
close
how
sweet
the
linnet
sing
repose
to
my
young
bride
and
me
mary
walter
to
lucasta
on
going
to
the
wars
tell
me
not
sweet
i
am
unkinde
that
from
the
nunnerie
of
thy
chaste
breast
and
quiet
minde
to
warre
and
armes
i
flee
true
a
new
mistresse
now
i
chase
the
first
foe
in
the
field
and
with
a
stronger
faith
imbrace
a
sword
a
horse
a
shield
yet
this
inconstancy
is
such
as
you
too
should
adore
i
could
not
love
thee
deare
so
much
loved
i
not
honor
more
the
land
of
lands
you
ask
me
why
though
ill
at
ease
within
this
region
i
subsist
whose
spirits
falter
in
the
mist
and
languish
for
the
purple
seas
it
is
the
land
that
freemen
till
that
freedom
chose
the
land
where
girt
with
friends
or
foes
a
man
may
speak
the
thing
he
will
a
land
of
settled
government
a
land
of
just
and
old
renown
where
freedom
broadens
slowly
down
from
precedent
to
precedent
where
faction
seldom
gathers
head
but
by
degrees
to
fulness
wrought
the
strength
of
some
diffusive
thought
hath
time
and
space
to
work
and
spread
should
banded
unions
persecute
opinion
and
induce
a
time
when
single
thought
is
civil
crime
and
individual
freedom
mute
though
power
should
make
from
land
to
land
the
name
of
britain
trebly
great
though
every
channel
of
the
state
should
almost
choke
with
golden
sand
yet
waft
me
from
the
wild
wind
i
seek
a
warmer
sky
and
i
will
see
before
i
die
the
palms
and
temples
of
the
south
the
soldier
dream
our
bugles
sang
truce
for
the
had
lowered
and
the
sentinel
stars
set
their
watch
in
the
sky
and
thousands
had
sunk
on
the
ground
overpowered
the
weary
to
sleep
and
the
wounded
to
die
when
reposing
that
night
on
my
pallet
of
straw
by
the
fagot
that
guarded
the
slain
at
the
dead
of
the
night
a
sweet
vision
i
saw
and
thrice
ere
the
morning
i
dreamt
it
again
methought
from
the
dreadful
array
far
far
i
had
roamed
on
a
desolate
track
was
autumn
and
sunshine
arose
on
the
way
to
the
home
of
my
fathers
that
welcomed
me
back
i
flew
to
the
pleasant
fields
traversed
so
oft
in
life
morning
march
when
my
bosom
was
young
i
heard
my
own
bleating
aloft
and
knew
the
sweet
strain
that
the
sung
then
pledged
we
the
and
fondly
i
swore
from
my
home
and
my
weeping
friends
never
to
part
my
little
ones
kissed
me
a
thousand
times
and
my
wife
sobbed
aloud
in
her
fulness
of
heart
stay
stay
with
us
rest
thou
art
weary
and
worn
and
fain
was
their
soldier
to
stay
but
sorrow
returned
with
the
dawning
of
morn
and
the
voice
in
my
dreaming
ear
melted
away
monterey
we
were
not
many
we
who
stood
before
the
iron
sleet
that
day
yet
many
a
gallant
spirit
would
give
half
his
years
if
but
he
could
have
been
with
us
at
monterey
now
here
now
there
the
shot
it
hailed
in
deadly
drifts
of
fiery
spray
yet
not
a
single
soldier
quailed
when
wounded
comrades
round
them
wailed
their
dying
shout
at
monterey
and
on
still
on
our
column
kept
through
walls
of
flame
its
withering
way
where
fell
the
dead
the
living
stept
still
charging
on
the
guns
which
swept
the
slippery
streets
of
monterey
the
foe
himself
recoiled
aghast
when
striking
where
he
strongest
lay
we
swooped
his
flanking
batteries
past
and
braving
full
their
murderous
blast
stormed
home
the
towers
of
monterey
our
banners
on
those
turrets
wave
and
there
our
evening
bugles
play
where
above
their
grave
keep
green
the
memory
of
the
brave
who
fought
and
fell
at
monterey
we
are
not
many
we
who
pressed
beside
the
brave
who
fell
that
day
but
who
of
us
has
not
confessed
he
rather
share
their
warrior
rest
than
not
have
been
at
monterey
fenno
a
song
of
the
camp
give
us
a
song
the
soldiers
cried
the
outer
trenches
guarding
when
the
heated
guns
of
the
camp
allied
grew
weary
of
bombarding
the
dark
redan
in
silent
scoff
lay
grim
and
threatening
under
and
the
tawny
mound
of
the
malakoff
no
longer
belched
its
thunder
there
was
a
pause
a
guardsman
said
we
storm
the
forts
sing
while
we
may
another
day
will
bring
enough
of
sorrow
they
lay
along
the
battery
side
below
the
smoking
cannon
brave
hearts
from
severn
and
from
clyde
and
from
the
banks
of
shannon
they
sang
of
love
and
not
of
fame
forgot
was
britain
glory
each
heart
recalled
a
different
name
but
all
sang
annie
laurie
voice
after
voice
caught
up
the
song
until
its
tender
passion
rose
like
an
anthem
rich
and
strong
their
confession
dear
girl
her
name
he
dared
not
speak
but
as
the
song
grew
louder
something
upon
the
soldier
cheek
washed
off
the
stains
of
powder
beyond
the
darkening
ocean
burned
the
bloody
sunset
embers
while
the
crimean
valleys
learned
how
english
love
remembers
and
once
again
a
fire
of
hell
rained
on
the
russian
quarters
with
scream
of
shot
and
burst
of
shell
and
bellowing
of
the
mortars
and
irish
nora
eyes
are
dim
for
a
singer
dumb
and
gory

the

of
the
federal
dead
may
they
sleep
so
calm
and
stately
each
in
his
graveyard
bed
it
scarcely
seems
that
lately
they
trod
the
fields
with
fearless
tread
they
marched
and
never
halted
they
scaled
the
parapet
the
triple
lines
assaulted
and
paid
without
regret
the
final
debt
the
debt
of
slow
accruing
a
guilty
nation
made
the
debt
of
evil
doing
of
justice
long
delayed
was
this
they
paid
on
fields
where
strife
held
riot
and
slaughter
fed
his
hounds
where
came
no
sense
of
quiet
nor
any
gentle
sounds
they
made
their
rounds
they
wrought
without
repining
till
weary
watches
they
passed
the
bounds
confining
our
green
familiar
shore
forevermore
and
now
they
sleep
so
stately
each
in
his
graveyard
bed
so
calmly
and
sedately
they
rest
that
once
i
said
these
men
are
dead
they
know
not
what
sweet
duty
we
come
each
year
to
pay
nor
heed

blooms
of
beauty

garland
gifts
of

strewn
here
the
and
the
the
rise

of

the
winter
and
the
to
them
whose
work
is
done
are
all
as
one

mine
eyes
there
floated
a
vision
of
the
land
where
their
brave
souls
promoted
to
heaven
own
armies
stand
at
god
right
hand
from
out
the
mighty
distance
i
seemed
to
see
them
gaze
back
on
their
old
existence
back
on
the
of
war
dread
days
the
flowers
shall
fade
and
perish
in
larger
faith
spake
i
but
these
dear
names
we
cherish
are
written
in
the
sky
and
can
not
die

how
sleep
the
brave
who
sink
to
rest
by
all
their
country
wishes
blessed
when
spring
with
dewy
fingers
cold
returns
to
deck
their
hallowed
mould
she
there
shall
dress
a
sweeter
sod
than
fancy
feet
have
ever
trod
by
fairy
hands
their
knell
is
rung
by
forms
unseen
their
dirge
is
sung
there
honor
comes
a
pilgrim
gray
to
bless
the
turf
that
wraps
their
clay
and
freedom
shall
awhile
repair
to
dwell
a
weeping
hermit
there
driving
home
the
cows
out
of
the
clover
and
grass
he
turned
them
into
the
one
after
another
he
let
them
pass
then
fastened
the
meadow
bars
again
under
the
willows
and
over
the
hill
he
patiently
followed
their
sober
pace
the
merry
whistle
for
once
was
still
and
something
shadowed
the
sunny
face
only
a
boy
and
his
father
had
said
he
never
could
let
his
youngest
go
two
already
were
lying
dead
under
the
feet
of
the
trampling
foe
but
after
the
evening
work
was
done
and
the
frogs
were
loud
in
the
over
his
shoulder
he
slung
his
gun
and
stealthily
followed
the
damp
across
the
clover
and
through
the
wheat
with
resolute
heart
and
purpose
grim
though
cold
was
the
dew
on
his
hurrying
feet
and
the
blind
bat
flitting
startled
him
thrice
since
then
had
the
lanes
been
white
and
the
orchards
sweet
with
and
now
when
the
cows
came
back
at
night
the
feeble
father
drove
them
home
for
news
had
come
to
the
lonely
farm
that
three
were
lying
where
two
had
lain
and
the
old
man
tremulous
palsied
arm
could
never
lean
on
a
son
again
the
summer
day
grew
cool
and
late
he
went
for
the
cows
when
the
work
was
done
but
down
the
lane
as
he
opened
the
gate
he
saw
them
coming
one
by
one
brindle
ebony
speckle
and
bess
shaking
their
horns
in
the
evening
wind
cropping
the
buttercups
out
of
the
grass
but
who
was
it
following
close
behind
loosely
swung
in
the
idle
air
the
empty
sleeve
of
army
blue
and
worn
and
pale
from
the
crisping
hair
looked
out
a
face
that
the
father
knew
for
southern
prisons
will
sometimes
yawn
and
yield
their
dead
unto
life
again
and
the
day
that
comes
with
a
cloudy
dawn
in
golden
glory
at
last
may
wane
the
great
tears
sprang
to
their
meeting
eyes
for
the
heart
must
speak
when
the
lips
are
dumb
and
under
the
silent
evening
skies
together
they
followed
the
cattle
home
putnam
the
brave
at
home
the
maid
who
binds
her
warrior
sash
with
smile
that
well
her
pain
dissembles
the
while
beneath
her
drooping
lash
one
starry
hangs
and
trembles
though
heaven
alone
records
the
tear
and
fame
shall
never
know
her
story
her
heart
has
shed
a
drop
as
dear
as
bedewed
the
field
of
glory
the
wife
who
girds
her
husband
sword
little
ones
who
weep
or
wonder
and
bravely
speaks
the
cheering
word
what
though
her
heart
be
rent
asunder
doomed
nightly
in
her
dreams
to
hear
the
bolts
of
death
around
him
rattle
hath
shed
as
sacred
blood
as
was
poured
upon
the
field
of
battle
the
mother
who
conceals
her
grief
while
to
her
breast
her
son
she
presses
then
breathes
a
few
brave
words
and
brief
kissing
the
patriot
brow
she
blesses
with
no
one
but
her
secret
god

know
the
pain
that
weighs
upon
her

each
thought
on
the
woman
who
loved
him
the
best
and
the
children
stood
watching
them
out
of
the
town
for
men
must
work
and
women
must
weep
and
there
little
to
earn
and
many
to
keep
though
the
be
moaning
three
wives
sat
up
in
the
lighthouse
tower
and
they
trimmed
the
lamps
as
the
sun
went
down
they
looked
at
the
squall
and
they
looked
at
the
shower
and
the
came
rolling
up
ragged
and
brown
but
men
must
work
and
women
must
weep
though
storms
be
sudden
and
waters
deep
and
the
be
moaning
three
corpses
lie
out
on
the
shining
sands
in
the
morning
gleam
as
the
tide
goes
down
and
the
women
are
weeping
and
wringing
their
hands
for
those
who
will
never
come
home
to
the
town
for
men
must
work
and
women
must
weep
and
the
sooner
it
over
the
sooner
to
sleep
and
good
by
to
the
bar
and
its
moaning
heroes
the
winds
that
once
the
argo
bore
have
died
by
neptune
ruined
shrines
and
her
hull
is
the
drift
of
the
floor
though
shaped
of
pelion
tallest
pines
you
may
seek
her
crew
on
every
isle
fair
in
the
foam
of
ægean
seas
but
out
of
their
rest
no
charm
can
wile
jason
and
orpheus
and
hercules
and
priam
wail
is
heard
no
more
by
windy
ilion

nor
great
achilles
stained
with
gore
cries
o
ye

snow
but
jove
has
gone
from
its

away
and
red
on
the
plain
the
poppies
grow
where
the
greek
and
the
trojan
fought
that
day
mother
earth
are
the
heroes
dead
do
they
thrill
the
soul
of
the
years
no
more
are
the
gleaming
snows
and
the
poppies
red
all
that
is
left
of
the
brave
of
yore
are
there
none
to
fight
as
theseus
fought
far
in
the
young
world
misty
dawn
or
to
teach
as
the
nestor
taught
mother
earth
are
the
heroes
gone
gone
in
a
grander
form
they
rise
dead
we
may
clasp
their
hands
in
ours
and
catch
the
light
of
their
clearer
eyes
and
wreathe
their
brows
with
immortal
flowers
wherever
a
noble
deed
is
done
is
the
pulse
of
a
hero
heart
is
stirred
wherever
the
right
has
a
triumph
won
there
are
the
heroes
voices
heard
their
armor
rings
on
a
fairer
field
than
the
greek
or
the
trojan
ever
trod
for
freedom
sword
is
the
blade
they
wield
and
the
light
above
is
the
smile
of
god
so
in
his
isle
of
calm
delight
jason
may
sleep
the
years
away
for
the
heroes
live
and
the
skies
are
bright
and
the
world
is
a
braver
world
dean
the
arsenal
at

this
is
the
arsenal
from
floor
to
ceiling
like
a
huge
organ
rise
the
burnished
arms
but
from
their
silent
pipes
no
anthem
pealing
startles
the
villages
with
strange
alarms
ah
what
a
sound
will
rise
how
wild
and
dreary
when
the
touches
those
swift
keys
what
loud
lament
and
dismal
miserere
will
mingle
with
their
awful
symphonies
i
hear
even
now
the
infinite
fierce
chorus
the
cries
of
agony
the
endless
groan
which
through
the
ages
that
have
gone
before
us
in
long
reverberations
reach
our
own
on
helm
and
harness
rings
the
saxon
hammer
through
cimbric
forest
roars
the
norseman
song
and
loud
amid
the
universal
clamor
distant
deserts
sounds
the
tartar
gong
i
hear
the
florentine
who
from
his
palace
wheels
out
his
with
dreadful
din
and
aztec
priests
upon
their
teocallis
beat
the
wild
made
of
serpent
skin
the
tumult
of
each
sacked
and
burning
village
the
shout
that
every
prayer
for
mercy
drowns
the
soldiers
revels
in
the
midst
of
pillage
the
wail
of
famine
in
beleaguered
towns
the
bursting
shell
the
gateway
wrenched
asunder
the
rattling
musketry
the
clashing
blade
and
ever
and
anon
in
tones
of
thunder
the
diapason
of
the
cannonade
is
it
o
man
with
such
discordant
noises
with
such
accursed
instruments
as
these
thou
drownest
nature
sweet

voices

the
celestial
harmonies

half
the
power
that

the
world
with
terror
were
half
the
wealth
bestowed
on
camps

courts
given
to
redeem
the
human
mind
from
error
there
were
no

the

abhorréd

every

would
wear
forevermore
the
curse
of
cain
down

through

the

fainter

the

hour
between

dark
and
the
daylight
when
the
night
is
beginning
to
lower
comes
a
pause
in
the
day
occupations
that
is
known
as
the
children
hour
i
hear
in
the
chamber
above
me
the
patter
of
little
feet
the
sound
of
a
door
that
is
opened
and
voices
soft
and
sweet
from
my
study
i
see
in
the
lamplight
descending
the
broad
grave
alice
and
laughing
allegra
and
edith
with
golden
hair
a
whisper
and
then
a
silence
yet
i
know
by
their
merry
eyes
they
are
plotting
and
planning
together
to
take
me
by
surprise
a
sudden
rush
from
the
stairway
a
sudden
raid
from
the
hall
by
three
doors
left
unguarded
they
enter
my
castle
wall
they
climb
up
into
my
turret
the
arms
and
back
of
my
chair
if
i
try
to
escape
they
surround
me
they
seem
to
be
everywhere
they
almost
devour
me
with
kisses
their
arms
about
me
entwine
till
i
think
of
the
bishop
of
bingen
in
his
on
the
rhine
do
you
think
o
banditti
because
you
have
scaled
the
wall
such
an
old
mustache
as
i
am
is
not
a
match
for
you
all
i
have
you
fast
in
my
fortress
and
will
not
let
you
depart
but
put
you
down
into
the
dungeon
in
the
round
tower
of
my
heart
and
there
will
i
keep
you
forever
yes
forever
and
a
day
till
the
walls
shall
crumble
to
ruin
and
moulder
in
dust
away
wadsworth
my
child
i
can
not
make
him
dead
his
fair
sunshiny
head
is
ever
bounding
round
my
study
chair
yet
when
my
eyes
now
dim
with
tears
i
turn
to
him
the
vision
vanishes
he
is
not
there
i
walk
my
parlor
floor
and
through
the
open
door
i
hear
a
footfall
on
the
chamber
stair
i
stepping
toward
the
hall
to
give
the
boy
a
call
and
then
bethink
me
that
he
is
not
there
i
thread
the
crowded
street
a
satchelled
lad
i
meet
with
the
same
beaming
eyes
and
colored
hair
and
as
he
running
by
follow
him
with
my
eye
scarcely
believing
that
he
is
not
there
i
know
his
face
is
hid
under
the
coffin
lid
closed
are
his
eyes
cold
is
his
forehead
fair
my
hand
that
marble
felt
it
in
prayer
i
knelt
yet
my
heart
whispers
that
he
is
not
there
i
can
not
make
him
dead
when
passing
by
the
bed
so
long
watched
over
with
parental
care
my
spirit
and
my
eye
seek
him
inquiringly
before
the
thought
comes
that
he
is
not
there
when
at
the
cool
gray
break
of
day
from
sleep
i
wake
with
my
first
breathing
of
the
morning
air
my
soul
goes
up
with
joy
to
him
who
gave
my
boy
then
comes
the
sad
thought
that
he
is
not
there
when
at
the
day
calm
close
before
we
seek
repose
i
with
his
mother
offering
up
our
prayer
i
may
be
saying
i
am
in
spirit
praying
for
our
boy
spirit
though
he
is
not
there
not
there
where
then
is
he
the
form
i
used
to
see
was
but
the
raiment
that
he
used
to
wear
the
grave
that
now
doth
press
upon
that
dress
is
but
his
wardrobe
locked
he
is
not
there
he
lives
in
all
the
past
he
lives
nor
to
the
last
of
seeing
him
again
will
i
despair
in
dreams
i
see
him
now
and
on
his
angel
brow
i
see
it
written
thou
shalt
see
me
yes
we
all
live
to
god
father
thy
chastening
rod
so
help
us
thine
afflicted
ones
to
bear

in

o
the
leal
lament
of
the
irish
emigrant
i
sittin
on
the
stile
mary
where
we
sat
side
by
side
on
a
bright
may
mornin
long
ago
when
first
you
were
my
bride
the
corn
was
springin
fresh
and
green
and
the
lark
sang
loud
and
high
and
the
red
was
on
your
lip
mary
and
the
in
your
eye
the
place
is
little
changed
mary
the
day
is
bright
as
then
the
lark
loud
song
is
in
my
ear
and
the
corn
is
green
again
but
i
miss
the
soft
clasp
of
your
hand
and
your
breath
warm
on
my
cheek
and
i
still
keep
for
the
words
you
never
more
will
speak
is
but
a
step
down
yonder
lane
and
the
little
church
stands
near
the
church
where
we
were
wed
mary
i
see
the
spire
from
here
but
the
graveyard
lies
between
mary
and
my
step
might
break
your
rest
for
i
laid
you
darling
down
to
sleep
with
your
baby
on
your
breast
i
very
lonely
now
mary
for
the
poor
make
no
new
friends
but
oh
they
love
the
better
still
the
few
our
father
sends
and
you
were
all
i
had
mary
my
blessin
and
my
pride
there
nothing
left
to
care
for
now
since
my
poor
mary
died
yours
was
the
good
brave
heart
mary
that
still
kept
hoping
on
when
the
trust
in
god
had
left
my
soul
and
my
arm
young
strength
was
gone
there
was
comfort
ever
on
your
lip
and
the
kind
look
on
your
brow
i
bless
you
mary
for
that
same
though
you
can
not
hear
me
now
i
thank
you
for
the
patient
smile
when
your
heart
was
fit
to
break
when
the
was
gnawin
there
and
you
hid
it
for
my
sake
i
bless
you
for
the
pleasant
word
when
your
heart
was
sad
and
sore
oh
i
thankful
you
are
gone
mary
where
grief
ca
reach
you
more
i
biddin
you
a
long
farewell
my
mary
kind
and
true
but
i
not
forget
you
darling
in
the
land
i
goin
to
they
say
there
bread
and
work
for
all
and
the
sun
shines
always
there
but
i
not
forget
old
ireland
were
it
fifty
times
as
fair
and
often
in
those
grand
old
woods
i
sit
and
shut
my
eyes
and
my
heart
will
travel
back
again
to
the
place
where
mary
lies
and
i
think
i
see
the
little
stile
where
we
sat
side
by
side
and
the
springin
corn
and
the
bright
may
morn
when
first
you
were
my
bride
the
we
watched
her
breathing
through
the
night
her
breathing
soft
and
low
as
in
her
breast
the
wave
of
life
kept
heaving
to
and
fro
so
silently
we
seemed
to
speak
so
slowly
moved
about
as
we
had
lent
her
half
our
powers
to
eke
her
living
out
our
very
hopes
belied
our
fears
our
fears
our
hopes
belied
we
thought
her
dying
when
she
slept
and
sleeping
when
she
died
for
when
the
morn
came
dim
and
sad
and
chill
with
early
showers
her
quiet
eyelids
closed
she
had
another
morn
than
ours
evelyn
hope
beautiful
evelyn
hope
is
dead
sit
and
watch
by
her
side
an
hour
that
is
her
this
her
bed
she
plucked
that
piece
of
geranium
flower
beginning
to
die
too
in
the
glass
little
has
yet
been
changed
i
think
the
shutters
are
shut
no
light
may
pass
save
two
long
rays
through
the
hinge
chink
sixteen
years
old
when
she
died
perhaps
she
had
scarcely
heard
my
name
it
was
not
her
time
to
love
beside
her
life
had
many
a
hope
and
aim
duties
enough
and
little
cares
and
now
was
quiet
now
astir
till
god
hand
beckoned
unawares
and
the
sweet
white
brow
is
all
of
her
is
it
too
late
then
evelyn
hope
what
your
soul
was
pure
and
true
the
good
stars
met
in
your
horoscope
made
you
of
spirit
fire
and
dew
and
just
because
i
was
thrice
as
old
and
our
paths
in
the
world
diverged
so
wide
each
was
naught
to
each
must
i
be
told
we
were
naught
beside
no
indeed
for
god
above
is
great
to
grant
as
mighty
to
make
and
creates
the
love
to
reward
the
love
i
claim
you
still
for
my
own
love
sake
delayed
it
may
be
for
more
lives
yet
through
worlds
i
shall
traverse
not
a
few
much
is
to
learn
and
much
to
forget
ere
the
time
be
come
for
taking
you
but
the
time
will
come
at
last
it
will
when
evelyn
hope
what
meant
i
shall
say
in
the
lower
earth
in
the
years
long
still
that
body
and
soul
so
pure
and
gay
why
your
hair
was
amber
i
shall
divine
and
your
mouth
of
your
own
geranium
red
and
what
you
would
do
with
me
in
fine
in
the
new
life
come
in
the
old
one
stead
i
have
lived
i
shall
say
so
much
since
then
given
up
myself
so
many
times
gained
me
the
gains
of
various
men
ransacked
the
ages
spoiled
the
climes
yet
one
thing
one
in
my
soul
full
scope
either
i
missed
or
itself
missed
me
and
i
want
and
find
you
evelyn
hope
what
is
the
issue
let
us
see
i
loved
you
evelyn
all
the
while
my
heart
seemed
full
as
it
could
hold
there
was
space
and
to
spare
for
the
frank
young
smile
and
the
red
young
mouth
and
the
hair
young
gold
so
hush
i
will
give
you
this
leaf
to
keep
see
i
shut
it
inside
the
sweet
cold
hand
there
that
is
our
secret
go
to
sleep
you
will
wake
and
remember
and
understand
a
bridal
dirge
weave
no
more
the
all
unmated
is
the
lover
death
has
the
place
of
pain
love
doth
call
on
love
in
vain
life
and
years
of
hope
are
over
no
more
want
of
no
more
need
of
bridal
favor
where
is
she
to
wear
them
well
you
beside
the
lover
tell
gone
with
all
the
love
he
gave
her
paler
than
the
stone
she
lies
colder
than
the
winter
morning
wherefore
did
she
thus
despise
she
with
pity
in
her
eyes
mother
care
and
lover
warning
youth
and
beauty
shall
they
not
last
beyond
a
brief
no
a
prayer
and
then
forgot
this
the
truest
lover
lot
this
the
sum
of
human
sorrow
waller
she
died
in
beauty
she
died
in
beauty
like
a
rose
blown
from
its
parent
stem
she
died
in
beauty
like
a
pearl
dropped
from
some
diadem
she
died
in
beauty
like
a
lay
along
a
moonlit
lake
she
died
in
beauty
like
the
song
of
birds
amid
the
brake
she
died
in
beauty
like
the
snow
on
flowers
dissolved
away
she
died
in
beauty
like
a
star
lost
on
the
brow
of
day
she
lives
in
glory
like
night
gems
set
round
the
silver
moon
she
lives
in
glory
like
the
sun
amid
the
blue
of
june
doyne
she
was
not
fair
nor
full
of
grace
she
was
not
fair
nor
full
of
grace
nor
crowned
with
thought
or
aught
beside
nor
wealth
had
she
of
mind
or
face
to
win
our
love
or
raise
our
pride
no
lover
thought
her
cheek
did
touch
no
poet
dream
was
round
her
thrown
and
yet
we
miss
her
ah
too
much
now
she
hath
flown
we
miss
her
when
the
morning
calls
as
one
that
mingled
in
our
mirth
we
miss
her
when
the
evening
falls
a
trifle
wanted
on
the
earth
some
fancy
small
or
subtile
thought
is
checked
ere
to
its
blossom
grown
some
chain
is
broken
that
we
wrought
now
she
hath
flown
no
solid
good
nor
hope
defined
is
marred
now
she
has
sunk
in
night
and
yet
the
strong
immortal
mind
is
stopped
in
its
triumphant
flight
perhaps
some
grain
lost
to
its
sphere
might
cast
the
great
sun
from
his
throne
for
all
we
know
is
she
was
here
and
she
hath
flown

thee
friend
of
my
better
days
none
knew
thee
but
to
love
thee
nor
named
thee
but
to
praise
tears
fell
when
thou
wert
dying
from
eyes
unused
to
weep
and
long
where
thou
art
lying
will
tears
the
cold
turf
steep
when
hearts
whose
truth
was
proven
like
thine
are
laid
in
earth
there
should
a
wreath
be
woven
to
tell
the
world
their
worth
and
i
who
woke
each
morrow
to
clasp
thy
hand
in
mine
who
shared
thy
joy
and
sorrow
whose
weal
and
woe
were
thine
it
should
be
mine
to
braid
it
around
thy
faded
brow
but
i
in
vain
essayed
it
and
feel
i
can
not
now
while
memory
bids
me
weep
thee
nor
thoughts
nor
words
are
free
the
grief
is
fixed
too
deeply
that
mourns
a
man
like
thee
she
is
far
from
the
land
she
is
far
from
the
land
where
her
young
hero
sleeps
and
lovers
are
round
her
sighing
but
coldly
she
turns
from
their
gaze
and
weeps
for
her
heart
in
his
grave
is
lying
she
sings
the
wild
songs
of
her
dear
native
plains
every
note
which
he
loved
awaking
ah
little
they
think
who
delight
in
her
strains
how
the
heart
of
the
minstrel
is
breaking
he
had
lived
for
his
love
for
his
country
he
died
they
were
all
that
to
life
had
entwined
him
nor
soon
shall
the
tears
of
his
country
be
dried
nor
long
will
his
love
stay
behind
him
oh
make
her
a
grave
where
the
sunbeams
rest
when
they
promise
a
glorious
morrow
they
shine
her
sleep
like
a
smile
from
the
west
from
her

my

thus
the
damsel
spake
and
died
in
memoriam
farewell
since
nevermore
for
thee
the
sun
comes
up
our
earthly
skies
less
bright
henceforth
shall
sunshine
be
to
some
fond
hearts
and
saddened
eyes
there
are
who
for
thy
last
long
sleep
shall
sleep
as
sweetly
nevermore
shall
weep
because
thou
canst
not
weep
and
grieve
that
all
thy
griefs
are
sad
thrift
of
love
the
loving
breast
on
which
the
aching
head
was
thrown
gave
up
the
weary
head
to
rest
but
kept
the
aching
for
its
own
the
graves
of
a
household
they
grew
in
beauty
side
by
side
they
filled
one
home
with
glee
their
graves
are
severed
far
and
wide
by
mount
and
stream
and
sea
the
same
fond
mother
bent
at
night
each
fair
sleeping
brow
she
had
each
folded
flower
in
sight
where
are
those
dreamers
now
one
the
forests
of
the
west
by
a
dark
stream
is
laid
the
indian
knows
his
place
of
rest
far
in
the
cedar
shade
the
sea
the
blue
lone
sea
hath
one
he
lies
where
pearls
lie
deep
he
was
the
loved
of
all
yet
none
his
low
bed
may
weep
one
sleeps
where
southern
vines
are
dressed
above
the
noble
slain
he
wrapped
his
colors
round
his
breast
on
a
field
of
spain
and
one
her
the
myrtle
showers
its
leaves
by
soft
winds
fanned
she
faded
italian
flowers
the
last
of
that
bright
band
and
parted
thus
they
rest
who
played
beneath
the
same
green
tree
whose
voices
mingled
as
they
prayed
around
one
parent
knee
they
that
with
smiles
lit
up
the
hall
and
cheered
with
song
the
hearth
alas
for
love
if
wert
all
and
naught
beyond
o
earth
the
hermit
at
the
close
of
the
day
when
the
hamlet
is
still
and
mortals
the
sweets
of
forgetfulness
prove
when
naught
but
the
torrent
is
heard
on
the
hill
and
naught
but
the
nightingale
song
in
the
grove
was
thus
by
the
cave
of
the
mountain
afar
while
his
harp
rang
symphonious
a
hermit
began
no
more
with
himself
or
with
nature
at
war
he
thought
as
a
sage
though
he
felt
as
a
man
ah
why
all
abandoned
to
darkness
and
woe
why
lone
philomela
that
languishing
fall
for
spring
shall
return
and
a
lover
bestow
and
sorrow
no
longer
thy
bosom
enthrall
but
if
pity
inspire
thee
renew
the
sad
lay
mourn
sweetest
complainer
man
calls
thee
to
mourn
o
soothe
him
whose
pleasures
like
thine
pass
away
full
quickly
they
pass
but
they
never
return
now
gliding
remote
on
the
verge
of
the
sky
the
moon
half
extinguished
her
crescent
displays
but
lately
i
marked
when
majestic
on
high
she
shone
and
the
planets
were
lost
in
her
blaze
roll
on
thou
fair
orb
and
with
gladness
pursue
the
path
that
conducts
thee
to
splendor
again
but
man
faded
glory
what
change
shall
renew
ah
fool
to
exult
in
a
glory
so
vain
is
night
and
the
landscape
is
lovely
no
more
i
mourn
but
ye
woodlands
i
mourn
not
for
you
for
morn
is
approaching
your
charms
to
restore
perfumed
with
fresh
fragrance
and
glittering
with
dew
nor
yet
for
the
ravage
of
winter
i
mourn
kind
nature
the
embryo
blossom
will
save
but
when
shall
spring
visit
the
mouldering
urn
o
when
shall
day
dawn
on
the
night
of
the
grave
was
thus
by
the
glare
of
false
science
betrayed
that
leads
to
bewilder
and
dazzles
to
blind
my
thoughts
wont
to
roam
from
shade
onward
to
shade
destruction
before
me
and
sorrow
behind
pity
great
father
of
light
then
i
cried
creature
who
fain
would
not
wander
from
thee
lo
humbled
in
dust
i
relinquish
my
pride
from
doubt
and
from
darkness
thou
only
canst
free
and
darkness
and
doubt
are
now
flying
away
no
longer
i
roam
in
conjecture
forlorn
so
breaks
on
the
traveller
faint
and
astray
the
bright
and
the
balmy
effulgence
of
morn
see
truth
love

immortal

from

o

the

from

shall
moulder

pleasure
her
triumphs
are
by
and
the
memory
of
those
who
have
loved

are
alike
from
the
minds
of
the
living
erased
the
hand
of
the
king
that
the

hath
borne

hath

hidden
and
lost
in
the
depth
of
the
grave
the
peasant
whose
lot
was
to
sow
and
to
reap
the
herdsman
who
climbed
with
his
goats
up
the
steep
the
beggar
who
wandered
in
search
of
his
bread
have
faded
away
like
the
grass
that
we
tread
the
saint
who
enjoyed
the
communion
of
heaven
the
sinner
who
dared
to
remain
unforgiven
the
wise
and
the
foolish
the
guilty
and
just
have
quietly
mingled
their
bones
in
the
dust
so
the
multitude
goes
like
the
flower
or
the
weed
that
withers
away
to
let
others
succeed
so
the
multitude
comes
even
those
we
behold
to
repeat
every
tale
that
has
often
been
told
for
we
are
the
same
that
our
fathers
have
been
we
see
the
same
sights
that
our
fathers
have
seen
we
drink
the
same
stream
and
we
view
the
same
sun
and
run
the
same
course
that
our
fathers
have
run
the
thoughts
we
are
thinking
our
fathers
would
think
from
the
death
that
we
shrink
from
our
fathers
would
shrink
to
the
life
that
we
cling
to
they
also
would
cling
but
it
speeds
for
us
all
like
a
bird
on
the
wing
they
loved
but
the
story
we
can
not
unfold
they
scorned
but
the
heart
of
the
haughty
is
cold
they
grieved
but
no
wail
from
their
slumbers
will
come
they
joyed
but
the
tongue
of
their
gladness
is
dumb
they
died
ay
they
died
and
we
things
that
are
now
who
walk
on
the
turf
that
lies
over
their
brow
who
make
in
their
dwelling
a
transient
abode
meet
the
things
that
they
met
on
their
pilgrimage
road
yea
hope
and
despondency
pleasure
and
pain
we
mingle
together
in
sunshine
and
rain
and
the
smiles
and
the
tears
the
song
and
the
dirge
still
follow
each
other
like
surge
upon
surge
is
the
wink
of
an
eye
is
the
draught
of
a
breath
from
the
blossom
of
health
to
the
paleness
of
death
from
the
gilded
saloon
to
the
bier
and
the
shroud
o
why
should
the
spirit
of
mortal
be
proud
progress
when
liberty
lives
loud
on
every
lip
but
freedom
moans
trampled
by
nations
whose
faint
footfalls
slip
round
bloody
thrones
when
here
and
there
in
dungeon
and
in
thrall
or
exile
pale
like
torches
dying
at
a
funeral
brave
natures
fail
when
truth
the
armed
archangel
stretches
wide
god
tromp
in
vain
and
the
world
drowsing
turns
upon
its
side
to
drowse
again
o
man
whose
course
hath
called
itself
sublime
since
it
began
what
art
thou
in
such
dying
age
of
time
as
man
to
man
when
love
last
wrong
hath
been
forgotten
coldly
as
first
love
face
and
like
a
rat
that
comes
to
wanton
boldly
in
some
lone
place
once
festal
in
the
realm
of
light
and
laughter
grim
doubt
appears
whilst
weird
suggestions
from
death
vague
hereafter
ruined
years
creep
dark
and
darker
with
new
dread
to
mutter
through
life
long
shade
yet
make
no
more
in
the
chill
breast
the
flutter
which
once
they
made
whether
it
be
that
all
doth
at
the
grave
round
to
its
term
that
nothing
lives
in
that
last
darkness
save
the
little
worm
or
whether
the
tired
spirit
prolong
its
course
through
realms
unseen
secure
that
unknown
world
can
not
be
worse
than
this
hath
been
then
when
thro
thought
gold
chain
so
frail
and
slender
no
link
will
meet
when
all
the
broken
harps
of
language
render
no
sound
that
sweet
when
like
torn
books
sad
days
weigh
down
each
other
i
the
dusty
shelf
o
man
what
art
thou
o
my
friend
my
brother
even
to
thyself
bulwer
the
little
black
boy
my
mother
bore
me
in
the
southern
wild
and
i
am
black
but
o
my
soul
is
white
white
as
an
angel
is
the
english
child
but
i
am
black
as
if
bereaved
of
light
my
mother
taught
me
underneath
a
tree
and
sitting
down
before
the
heat
of
day
she
took
me
on
her
lap
and
kisséd
me
and
pointing
to
the
east
began
to
say
look
on
the
rising
sun
there
god
does
live
and
gives
his
light
and
gives
his
heat
away
and
flowers
and
trees
and
beasts
and
men
receive
comfort
in
morning
joy
in
the
noonday
and
we
are
put
on
earth
a
little
space
that
we
may
learn
to
bear
the
beams
of
love
and
these
black
bodies
and
this
sunburnt
face
are
but
a
cloud
and
like
a
shady
grove
for
when
our
souls
have
learned
the
heat
to
bear
the
clouds
will
vanish
we
shall
hear
his
voice
saving
from
the
grove
my
love
and
care
and
round
my
golden
tent
like
lambs
rejoice
thus
did
my
mother
say
and
kisséd
me
and
thus
i
say
to
little
english
boy
when
i
from
black
and
he
from
white
cloud
free
and
round
the
tent
of
god
like
lambs
we
joy
i
shade
him
from
the
heat
till
he
can
bear
to
lean
in
joy
upon
our
father
knee
and
then
i
stand
and
stroke
his
silver
hair
and
be
like
him
and
he
will
then
love
me
deaths
final
conquest
the
glories
of
our
birth
and
state
are
shadows
not
substantial
things
there
is
no
armor
against
fate
death
lays
his
icy
hands
on
kings
sceptre
and
crown
must
tumble
down
and
in
the
dust
be
equal
made
with
the
poor
crooked
scythe
and
spade
some
men
with
swords
may
reap
the
field
and
plant
fresh
laurels
where
they
kill
but
their
strong
nerves
at
last
must
yield
they
tame
but
one
another
still
early
or
late
they
stoop
to
fate
and
must
give
up
their
murmuring
breath
when
they
pale
captives
creep
to
death
the
garlands
wither
on
your
brow
then
boast
no
more
your
mighty
deeds
upon
death
purple
altar
now
see
where
the
victor
victim
bleeds
all
heads
must
come
to
the
cold
tomb
only
the
actions
of
the
just
smell
sweet
and
blossom
in
the
dust
to
an
indian
gold
coin
slave
of
the
dark
and
dirty
mine
what
vanity
has
brought
thee
here
how
can
i
love
to
see
thee
shine
so
bright
whom
i
have
bought
so
dear
the
flapping
lone
i
hear
for
twilight
converse
arm
in
arm
the
jackal
shriek
bursts
on
mine
ear
when
mirth
and
music
wont
to
charm
by
cherical
dark
wandering
streams
where
shadow
all
the
wild
sweet
visions
haunt
my
waking
dreams
of
teviot
loved
while
still
a
child
of
castled
rocks
stupendous
piled
by
esk
or
eden
classic
wave
where
loves
of
youth
and
friendship
smiled
uncursed
by
thee
vile
yellow
slave
fade
sweet
from
memory
fade
the
perished
bliss
of
youth
first
prime
that
once
so
bright
on
fancy
played
revives
no
more
in
far
from
my
sacred
natal
clime
i
haste
to
an
untimely
grave
the
daring
thoughts
that
soared
sublime
are
sunk
in
ocean
southern
wave
slave
of
the
mine
thy
yellow
light
gleams
baleful
as
the
drear
a
gentle
vision
comes
by
night
my
lonely
widowed
heart
to
cheer
her
eyes
are
dim
with
many
a
tear
that
once
were
guiding
stars
to
mine
her
fond
heart
throbs
with
many
a
fear
i
can
not
bear
to
see
thee
shine
for
thee
for
thee
vile
yellow
slave
i
left
a
heart
that
loved
me
true
i
crossed
the
tedious
to
roam
in
climes
unkind
and
new
the
cold
wind
of
the
stranger
blew
chill
on
my
withered
heart
the
grave
dark
and
untimely
met
my
view
and
all
for
thee
vile
yellow
slave
ha
thou
now
so
late
to
mock
a
wanderer
banished
heart
forlorn
now
that
his
frame
the
lightning
shock
of
tipped
with
death
has
borne
from
love
from
friendship
country
torn
to
memory
fond
regrets
the
prey
vile
slave
thy
yellow
dross
i
scorn
go
mix
thee
with
thy
kindred
clay
going
home
drawn
by
horses
with
decorous
feet
a
carriage
for
one
went
through
the
street
polished
as
anthracite
out
of
the
mine
tossing
its
plumes
so
stately
and
fine
as
nods
to
the
night
a
norway
pine
the
passenger
lay
in
parian
rest
as
if
by
the
sculptor
hand
caressed
a
mortal
life
through
the
marble
stole
and
then
till
an
angel
calls
the
roll
it
waits
awhile
for
a
human
soul
he
rode
in
state
but
his
was
left
unpaid
to
his
only
heir
hardly
a
man
from
hovel
to
throne
takes
to
this
route
in
coach
of
his
own
but
borrows
at
last
and
travels
alone
the
driver
sat
in
his
silent
seat
the
world
as
still
as
a
field
of
wheat
gave
all
the
road
to
the
speechless
twain
and
thought
the
passenger
never
again
should
travel
that
way
with
living
men
not
a
robin
held
its
little
breath
but
sang
right
on
in
the
face
of
death
you
never
would
dream
to
see
the
sky
give
glance
for
glance
to
the
violet
eye
that
aught
between
them
could
ever
die
a
wain
bound
east
met
the
hearse
bound
west
halted
a
moment
and
passed
abreast
and
i
verily
think
a
stranger
pair
have
never
met
on
a
thoroughfare
or
a
dim
or
anywhere
the
hearse
as
slim
and
glossy
and
still
as
silken
thread
at
a
woman
will
who
watches
her
work
with
tears
unshed
broiders
a
grief
with
needle
and
thread
mourns
in
pansies
and
cypress
the
dead
spotless
the
steeds
in
a
satin
dress
that
run
for
two
worlds
the
lord
express
long
as
the
route
of
arcturus
ray
brief
as
the
publican
trying
to
pray
no
other
steeds
by
no
other
way
could
go
so
far
in
a
single
day
from
wagon
broad
and
heavy
and
rude
a
group
looking
out
from
a
single
hood
striped
with
the
flirt
of
a
heedless
lash
dappled
and
dimmed
with
many
a
splash
gathered
behind
like
an
old
calash
it
made
you
think
of
a
schooner
sail
mildewed
with
weather
tattered
by
gale
down
by
the
run
from
mizzen
and
main
that
canvas
mapped
with
stipple
and
stain
of
western
earth
and
the
prairie
rain
the
walked
in
his
ribs
between
the
hinder
wheels
with
sleepy
mien
a
dangling
pail
to
the
axle
slung
astern
of
the
wain
a
manger
hung
a
schooner
boat
by
the
davits
swung
the
boys
sat
three
in
a
row
with
eyes
of
wonder
and
heads
of
tow
father
looked
sadly
over
his
brood
mother
just
lifted
a
flap
of
the
hood
all
saw
the
hearse
and
two
understood
they
thought
of
the
cabin
small
hid
like
a
nest
in
the
grasses
tall
where
plains
swept
boldly
off
in
the
air
grooved
into
heaven
everywhere
so
near
the
stars
invisible
stair
that
planets
and
prairie
almost
met
just
cleared
its
edges
as
they
set
they
thought
of
the
level
world
divide
and
their
hearts
flowed
down
its
other
side
to
the
grave
of
the
little
girl
that
died
they
thought
of
childhood
neighborly
hills
with
sunshine
aprons
and
ribbons
of
rills
that
drew
so
near
when
the
day
went
down
put
on
a
crimson
and
golden
crown
and
sat
together
in
mantles
brown
the
dawn
red
plume
in
their
winter
caps
and
night
asleep
in
their
drowsy
laps
lightening
the
load
of
the
shouldered
wood
by
shedding
the
shadows
as
they
could
that
gathered
round
where
the
homestead
stood
they
thought
that
pair
in
the
rugged
wain
thinking
with
bosom
rather
than
brain
they
never
know
till
their
dying
day
that
what
they
thought
and
never
could
say
their
hearts
throbbed
out
in
an
alpine
lay
the
old
waldensian
song
again
thank
god
for
the
mountains
and
amen
the
wain
gave
a
lurch
the
hearse
moved
on
a
moment
or
two
and
both
were
gone
the
wain
bound
east
the
hearse
bound
west
both
going
home
both
looking
for
rest
the
lord
save
all
and
his
name
be
blest

is
short
the
journey
so
the
pear
doth
rot
the
plum
doth
fall
the
snow
dissolves
and
so
must
all
life
like
to
the
falling
of
a
star
or
as
the
flights
of
eagles
are
or
like
the
fresh
spring
gaudy
hue
or
silver
drops
of
morning
dew
or
like
a
wind
that
chafes
the
flood
or
bubbles
which
on
water
stood
even
such
is
man
whose
borrowed
light
is
straight
called
in
and
paid
the
wind
blows
out
the
bubble
dies
the
spring
entombed
in
autumn
lies
the
dew
dries
up
the
star
is
shot
the
flight
is
past
and
man
forgot
a
lament
o
world
o
life
o
time
on
whose
last
steps
i
climb
trembling
at
that
where
i
had
stood
before
when
will
return
the
glory
of
your
prime
no
more
o
nevermore
out
of
the
day
and
night
a
joy
has
taken
flight
fresh
spring
and
summer
and
winter
hoar
move
my
faint
heart
with
grief
but
with
delight
no
more
o
nevermore
bysshe

life
i
know
not
what
thou
art
but
know
that
thou
and
i
must
part
and
when
or
how
or
where
we
met
i
own
to
me
a
secret
yet
life
we
been
long
together
through
pleasant
and
through
cloudy
weather
is
hard
to
part
when
friends
are
dear
perhaps
cost
a
sigh
a
tear
then
steal
away
give
little
warning
choose
thine
own
time
say
not
good
night
but
in
some
brighter
clime
bid
me
good
morning
lætitia
tithonus
the
woods
decay
the
woods
decay
and
fall
the
vapors
weep
their
burden
to
the
ground
man
comes
and
tills
the
field
and
lies
beneath
and
after
many
a
summer
dies
the
swan
me
only
cruel
immortality
consumes
i
wither
slowly
in
thine
arms
here
at
the
quiet
limit
of
the
world
a
shadow
roaming
like
a
dream
the
spaces
of
the
east
mists
and
gleaming
halls
of
morn
alas
for
this
gray
shadow
once
a
man
so
glorious
in
his
beauty
and
thy
choice
who
madest
him
thy
chosen
that
he
seemed
to
his
great
heart
none
other
than
a
god
i
asked
thee
give
me
immortality
then
didst
thou
grant
mine
asking
with
a
smile
like
wealthy
men
who
care
not
how
they
give
but
thy
strong
hours
indignant
worked
their
wills
and
beat
me
down
and
marred
and
wasted
me
and
though
they
could
not
end
me
left
me
maimed
to
dwell
in
presence
of
immortal
youth
immortal
age
beside
immortal
youth
and
all
i
was
in
ashes
can
thy
love
thy
beauty
make
amends
though
even
now
close
over
us
the
silver
star
thy
guide
shines
in
those
tremulous
eyes
that
fill
with
tears
to
hear
me
let
me
go
take
back
thy
gift
why
should
a
man
desire
in
any
way
to
vary
from
the
kindly
race
of
men
or
pass
beyond
the
goal
of
ordinance
where
all
should
pause
as
is
most
meet
for
all
a
soft
air
fans
the
cloud
apart
there
comes
a
glimpse
of
that
dark
world
where
i
was
born
once
more
the
old
mysterious
glimmer
steals
from
thy
pure
brows
and
from
thy
shoulders
pure
and
bosom
beating
with
a
heart
renewed
thy
cheek
begins
to
redden
through
the
gloom
thy
sweet
eyes
brighten
slowly
close
to
mine
ere
yet
they
blind
the
stars
and
the
wild
team
which
love
thee
yearning
for
thy
yoke
arise
and
shake
the
darkness
from
their
loosened
manes
and
beat
the
twilight
into
flakes
of
fire
lo
ever
thus
thou
growest
beautiful
in
silence
then
before
thine
answer
given
departest
and
thy
tears
are
on
my
cheek
why
wilt
thou
ever
scare
me
with
thy
tears
and
make
me
tremble
lest
a
saying
learnt
in
days
on
that
dark
earth
be
true
the
gods
themselves
can
not
recall
their
gifts
ay
me
ay
me
with
what
another
heart
in
days
and
with
what
other
eyes
i
used
to
watch
if
i
be
he
that
watched
the
lucid
outline
forming
round
thee
saw
the
dim
curls
kindle
into
sunny
rings
changed
with
thy
mystic
change
and
felt
my
blood
glow
with
the
glow
that
slowly
crimsoned
all
thy
presence
and
thy
portals
while
i
lay
mouth
forehead
eyelids
growing
with
kisses
balmier
than
buds
of
april
and
could
hear
the
lips
that
kissed
whispering
i
knew
not
what
of
wild
and
sweet
like
that
strange
song
i
heard
apollo
sing
while
ilion
like
a
mist
rose
into
towers
yet
hold
me
not
forever
in
thine
east
how
can
my
nature
longer
mix
with
thine
coldly
thy
rosy
shadows
bathe
me
cold
are
all
thy
lights
and
cold
my
wrinkled
feet
upon
thy
glimmering
thresholds
when
the
steam
floats
up
from
those
dim
fields
about
the
homes
of
happy
men
that
have
the
power
to
die
and
grassy
barrows
of
the
happier
dead
release
me
and
restore
me
to
the
ground
thou
seest
all
things
thou
wilt
see
my
grave
thou
wilt
renew
thy
beauty
morn
by
morn
i
earth
in
earth
forget
these
empty
courts
and
thee
returning
on
thy
silver
wheels
the
woman
of
three
cows
from
the
irish
o
woman
of
three
cows
agragh
do
let
yourtongue
thus
rattle
o
do
be
saucy
do
be
stiff
because
you
may
have
cattle
i
seen
and
here
my
hand
to
you
i
only
say
what
true
a
many
a
one
with
twice
your
stock
not
half
so
proud
as
you
good
luck
to
you
do
scorn
the
poor
and
do
be
their
despiser
for
worldly
wealth
soon
melts
away
and
cheats
the
very
miser
and
death
soon
strips
the
proudest
wreath
from
haughty
human
brows
then
do
be
stiff
and
do
be
proud
good
woman
of
three
cows
see
where
mononia
heroes
lie
proud
owen
more
descendants
is
they
that
won
the
glorious
name
and
had
the
grand
attendants
if
they
were
forced
to
bow
to
fate
as
every
mortal
bows
can
you
be
proud
can
you
be
stiff
my
woman
of
three
cows
the
brave
sons
of
the
lord
of
clare
they
left
the
land
to
mourning
movrone
for
they
were
banished
with
no
hope
of
their
returning
who
knows
in
what
abodes
of
want
those
youths
were
driven
to
house
yet
you
can
give
yourself
these
airs
o
woman
of
three
cows
o
think
of
donnell
of
the
ships
the
chief
whom
nothing
daunted
see
how
he
fell
in
distant
spain
unchronicled
unchanted
he
sleeps
the
great
where
thunder
can
not
rouse
then
ask
yourself
should
you
be
proud
good
woman
of
three
cows
maguire
those
souls
of
fire
whose
names
are
shrined
in
story
think
how
their
high
achievements
once
made
erin
greatest
glory
yet
now
their
bones
lie
mouldering
under
weeds
and
cypress
boughs
and
so
for
all
your
pride
will
yours
o
woman
of
three
cows
the
also
famed
when
fame
was
only
for
the
boldest
rest
in
forgotten
sepulchres
with
erin
best
and
oldest
yet
who
so
great
as
they
of
yore
in
battle
or
carouse
just
think
of
that
and
hide
your
head
good
woman
of
three
cows
your
neighbor
poor
and
you
it
seems
are
big
with
vain
ideas
because
forsooth
you
got
three
cows
one
more
i
see
than
she
has
that
tongue
of
yours
wags
more
at
times
than
charity
allows
but
if
you
strong
be
merciful
great
woman
of
three
cows
now
there
you
go
you
still
of
course
keep
up
your
scornful
bearing
and
i
too
poor
to
hinder
you
but
by
the
cloak
i
wearing
if
i
had
but
four
cows
myself
even
though
you
were
my
spouse
i
thwack
you
well
to
cure
your
pride
my
woman
of
three
cows
clarence
a
farewell
my
fairest
child
i
have
no
song
to
give
you
no
lark
could
pipe
to
skies
so
dull
and
gray
yet
ere
we
part
one
lesson
i
can
leave
you
for
every
day
be
good
sweet
maid
and
let
who
will
be
clever
do
noble
things
not
dream
them
all
day
long
and
so
make
life
death
and
that
vast
forever
one
grand
sweet
song
ode
on
a
grecian
urn
thou
still
unravished
bride
of
quietness
thou
of
silence
and
slow
time
sylvan
historian
who
canst
thus
express
a
flowery
tale
more
sweetly
than
our
rhyme
what
legend
haunts
about
thy
shape
of
deities
or
mortals
or
of
both
in
tempe
or
the
dales
of
arcady
what
men
or
gods
are
these
what
maidens
loath
what
mad
pursuit
what
struggle
to
escape
what
pipes
and
timbrels
what
wild
ecstasy
heard
melodies
are
sweet
but
those
unheard
are
sweeter
therefore
ye
soft
pipes
play
on
not
to
the
sensual
ear
but
more
endeared
pipe
to
the
spirit
ditties
of
no
tone
fair
youth
beneath
the
trees
thou
canst
not
leave
thy
song
nor
ever
can
those
trees
be
bare
bold
lover
never
never
canst
thou
kiss
though
winning
near
the
goal
yet
do
not
grieve
she
can
not
fade
though
thou
hast
not
thy
bliss
forever
wilt
thou
love
and
she
be
fair
ah
happy
happy
boughs
that
can
not
shed
your
leaves
nor
ever
bid
the
spring
adieu
and
happy
melodist
unweariéd
forever
piping
songs
forever
new
more
happy
love
more
happy
happy
love
forever
warm
and
still
to
be
enjoyed
forever
panting
and
forever
young
all
breathing
human
passion
far
above
that
leaves
a
heart
high
sorrowful
and
cloyed
a
burning
forehead
and
a
parching
tongue
who
are
these
coming
to
the
sacrifice
to
what
green
altar
o
mysterious
priest
thou
that
heifer
lowing
at
the
skies
and
all
her
silken
flanks
with
garlands
dressed
what
little
town
by
river
or
or
with
peaceful
citadel
is
emptied
of
its
folk
this
pious
morn
ah
little
town
thy
streets
forevermore
will
silent
be
and
not
a
soul
to
tell
why
thou
art
desolate
can
return
o
attic
shape
fair
attitude
with
brede
of
marble
men
and
maidens
overwrought
with
forest
branches
and
the
trodden
weed
thou
silent
form
dost
tease
us
out
of
thought
as
doth
eternity
cold
pastoral
when
old
age
shall
this
generation
waste
thou
shalt
remain
in
midst
of
other
woe
than
ours
a
friend
to
man
to
whom
thou
beauty
is
truth
truth
beauty
that
is
all
ye
know
on
earth
and
all
ye
need
to
know
lines
on
a
skeleton
behold
this
ruin
was
a
skull
once
of
ethereal
spirit
full
this
narrow
cell
was
life
retreat
this
space
was
thought
mysterious
seat
what
beauteous
visions
filled
this
spot
what
dreams
of
pleasure
long
forgot
nor
hope
nor
joy
nor
love
nor
fear
have
left
one
trace
of
record
here
beneath
this
mouldering
canopy
once
shone
the
bright
and
busy
eye
but
start
not
at
the
dismal
void
if
social
love
that
eye
employed
if
with
no
lawless
fire
it
gleamed
but
through
the
dews
of
kindness
beamed
that
eye
shall
be
forever
bright
when
stars
and
sun
are
sunk
in
night
within
this
hollow
cavern
hung
the
ready
swift
and
tuneful
tongue
if
falsehood
honey
it
disdained
and
when
it
could
not
praise
was
chained
if
bold
in
virtue
cause
it
spoke
yet
gentle
concord
never
broke
this
silent
tongue
shall
plead
for
thee
when

unveils
eternity

did
these
fingers
delve
the
mine
or
with
the
envied
rubies
shine
to
hew
the
rock
or

little
now

them
but
if
the

they

to
the

these

a

devotion
tell
love
it

but
lust
tell

in
fickle
points
of

tell

boldness
tell
skill
it

pretension
tell

shed
one
by
that
paltry
bed
greater
than
thou
beneath
that
beggar
roof
lo
death
doth
keep
his
state
enter
no
crowds
attend
enter
no
guards
defend
palace
gate
that
pavement
damp
and
cold
no
smiling
courtiers
tread
one
silent
woman
stands
lifting
with
meagre
hands
a
dying
head
no
mingling
voices
sound
an
infant
wail
alone
a
sob
suppressed
again
that
short
deep
gasp
and
then
the
parting
groan
o
change
o
wondrous
change
burst
are
the
prison
bars
this
moment
so
low
so
agonized
and
now
beyond
the
stars
o
change
stupendous
change
there
lies
the
soulless
clod
the
sun
eternal
breaks
the
new
immortal
wakes
wakes
with
his
god
bowles
on
a
picture
of
peel
castle
in
a
storm
i
was
thy
neighbor
once
thou
rugged
pile
four
summer
weeks
i
dwelt
in
sight
of
thee
i
saw
thee
every
day
and
all
the
while
thy
form
was
sleeping
on
a
glassy
sea
so
pure
the
sky
so
quiet
was
the
air
so
like
so
very
like
was
day
to
day
i
looked
thy
image
still
was
there
it
trembled
but
it
never
passed
away
how
perfect
was
the
calm
it
seemed
no
sleep
no
mood
which
season
takes
away
or
brings
i
could
have
fancied
that
the
mighty
deep
was
even
the
gentlest
of
all
gentle
things
ah
then
if
mine
had
been
the
painter
hand
to
express
what
then
i
saw
and
add
the
gleam
the
light
that
never
was
on
sea
or
land
the
consecration
and
the
poet
dream
i
would
have
planted
thee
thou
hoary
pile
amid
a
world
how
different
from
this
beside
a
sea
that
could
not
cease
to
smile
on
tranquil
land
beneath
a
sky
of
bliss
a
picture
had
it
been
of
lasting
ease
elysian
quiet
without
toil
or
strife
no
motion
but
the
moving
tide
a
breeze
or
merely
silent
nature
breathing
life
such
in
the
fond
illusion
of
my
heart
such
picture
would
i
at
that
time
have
made
and
seen
the
soul
of
truth
in
every
part
a
steadfast
peace
that
might
not
be
betrayed
so
once
it
would
have
been
is
so
no
more
i
have
submitted
to
a
new
control
a
power
has
gone
which
nothing
can
restore
a
deep
distress
hath
humanized
my
soul
not
for
a
moment
could
i
now
behold
a
smiling
sea
and
be
what
i
have
been
the
feeling
of
my
loss
will
be
old
this
which
i
know
i
speak
with
mind
serene
then
beaumont
friend
who
would
have
been
the
friend
if
he
had
lived
of
him
whom
i
deplore
this
work
of
thine
i
blame
not
but
commend
this
sea
in
anger
and
that
dismal
shore
o
is
a
passionate
work
yet
wise
and
well
well
chosen
is
the
spirit
that
is
here
that
hulk
which
labors
in
the
deadly
swell
this
rueful
sky
this
pageantry
of
fear
and
this
huge
castle
standing
here
sublime
i
love
to
see
the
look
with
which
it
braves
cased
in
the
unfeeling
armor
of
old
time
the
lightning
the
fierce
wind
and
trampling
waves
farewell
farewell
the
heart
that
lives
alone
housed
in
a
dream
at
distance
from
the
kind
such
happiness
wherever
it
be
known
is
to
be
pitied
for
is
surely
blind
but
welcome
fortitude
and
patient
cheer
and
frequent
sights
of
what
is
to
be
borne
such
sights
or
worse
as
are
before
me
here
not
without
hope
we
suffer
and
we
mourn
the
treasures
of
the
deep
what
thou
in
thy
and
cells
thou
and
mysterious
main
pale
glistening
pearls
and
shells
bright
things
which
gleam
unrecked
of
and
in
vain
keep
keep
thy
riches
melancholy
sea
we
ask
not
such
from
thee
yet
more
the
depths
have
more
what
wealth
untold
far
down
and
shining
through
their
stillness
lies
thou
hast
the
starry
gems
the
burning
gold
won
from
ten
thousand
royal
argosies
sweep
thy
spoils
thou
wild
and
wrathful
main
earth
claims
not
these
again
yet
more
the
depths
have
more
thy
waves
have
rolled
above
the
cities
of
a
world
gone
by
sand
hath
filled
up
the
palaces
of
old
the
halls
of
dash
them
ocean
in
thy
scornful
play
man
yields
them
to
decay
yet
more
the
billows
and
the
depths
have
more
high
hearts
and
brave
are
gathered
to
thy
breast
they
hear
not
now
the
booming
waters
roar
the
will
not
break
their
keep
thy
red
gold
and
gems
thou
stormy
grave
give
back
the
true
and
brave
give
back
the
lost
and
lovely
those
for
whom
the
place
was
kept
at
board
and
hearth
so
long
the
prayer
went
up
through
midnight
breathless
gloom
and
the
vain
yearning
woke
midst
festal
song
hold
fast
thy
buried
isles
thy
towers
but
all
is
not
thine
own
to
thee
the
love
of
woman
hath
gone
down
dark
flow
thy
tides
manhood
noble
head
youth
bright
locks
and
beauty
flowery
crown
yet
must
thou
hear
a
voice
restore
the
dead
earth
shall
reclaim
her
precious
things
from
thee
restore
the
dead
thou
sea
the
cloud
a
cloud
lay
cradled
near
the
setting
sun
a
gleam
of
crimson
tinged
its
braided
snow
long
had
i
watched
the
glory
moving
on
the
still
radiance
of
the
lake
below
tranquil
its
spirit
seemed
and
floated
slow
in
its
very
motion
there
was
rest
while
every
breath
of
eve
that
chanced
to
blow
wafted
the
traveller
to
the
beauteous
west
emblem
methought
of
the
departed
soul
to
whose
white
robe
the
gleam
of
bliss
is
given
and
by
the
breath
of
mercy
made
to
roll
right
onward
to
the
golden
gates
of
heaven
while
to
the
eye
of
faith
it
peaceful
lies
and
tells
to
man
his
glorious
destinies
the
chambered
nautilus
this
is
the
ship
of
pearl
which
poets
feign
sails
the
unshadowed
main
the
venturous
bark
that
flings
on
the
sweet
summer
wind
its
purple
wings
in
gulfs
enchanted
where
the
siren
sings
and
coral
reefs
lie
bare
where
the
cold
rise
to
sun
their
streaming
hair
its
webs
of
living
gauze
no
more
unfurl
wrecked
is
the
ship
of
pearl
and
every
chambered
cell
where
its
life
was
wont
to
dwell
as
the
frail
tenant
shaped
his
growing
shell
before
thee
lies
revealed
its
irised
ceiling
rent
its
sunless
crypt
unsealed
year
after
year
beheld
the
silent
toil
that
spread
his
lustrous
coil
still
as
the
spiral
grew
he
left
the
past
year
dwelling
for
the
new
stole
with
soft
step
its
shining
archway
through
built
up
its
idle
door
stretched
in
his
home
and
knew
the
old
no
more
thanks
for
the
heavenly
message
brought
by
thee
child
of
the
wandering
sea
cast
from
her
lap
forlorn
from
thy
dead
lips
a
clearer
note
is
born
than
ever
triton
blew
from
wreathéd
horn
while
on
mine
ear
it
rings
through
the
deep
caves
of
thought
i
hear
a
voice
that
sings
build
thee
more
stately
mansions
o
my
soul
as
the
swift
seasons
roll
leave
thy
past
let
each
new
temple
nobler
than
the
last
shut
thee
from
heaven
with
a
dome
more
vast
till
thou
at
length
art
free
leaving
thine
outgrown
shell
by
life
unresting
sea
wendell
agnes
deep
on
the
the
snows
are
sparkling
to
the
moon
my
breath
to
heaven
like
vapor
goes
may
my
soul
follow
soon
the
shadows
of
the
slant
down
the
snowy
sward
still
creeping
with
the
creeping
hours
that
lead
me
to
my
lord
make
thou
my
spirit
pure
and
clear
as
are
the
frosty
skies
or
this
first
snowdrop
of
the
year
that
in
my
bosom
lies
as
these
white
robes
are
soiled
and
dark
to
yonder
shining
ground
as
this
pale
taper
earthly
spark
to
yonder
argent
round
so
shows
my
soul
before
the
lamb
my
spirit
before
thee
so
in
mine
earthly

hope
to
be

o
lord
and
far
through
all
yon

me
thy
bride

glittering
star

me
to
the
golden
doors
the
flashes

all
heaven
bursts
her
starry
floors
and
strews
her
lights
below
and
deepens
on
and
up
the
gates
roll
back
and
far
within
for
me
the
heavenly
bridegroom
waits
to
make
me
pure
of

the
sabbaths
of

one
sabbath
deep
and
wide
a

upon
the
shining

the
bridegroom
with
his
bride
a

hymn
it
was
the
calm
and
silent
night
seven
hundred
years
and
had
rome
been
growing
up
to
might
and
now
was
queen
of
land
and
sea
no
sound
was
heard
of
clashing
wars
peace
brooded
the
hushed
domain
apollo
pallas
jove
and
mars
held
undisturbed
their
ancient
reign
in
the
solemn
midnight
centuries
ago
was
in
the
calm
and
silent
night
the
senator
of
haughty
rome
impatient
urged
his
chariot
flight
from
lordly
revel
rolling
home
triumphal
arches
gleaming
swell
his
breast
with
thoughts
of
boundless
sway
what
recked
the
roman
what
befell
a
paltry
province
far
away
in
the
solemn
midnight
centuries
ago
within
that
province
far
away
went
plodding
home
a
weary
boor
a
streak
of
light
before
him
lay
fallen
through
a
across
his
path
he
passed
for
naught
told
what
was
going
on
within
how
keen
the
stars
his
only
thought
the
air
how
calm
and
cold
and
thin
in
the
solemn
midnight
centuries
ago
o
strange
indifference
low
and
high
drowsed
over
common
joys
and
cares
the
earth
was
still
but
knew
not
why
the
world
was
listening
unawares
how
calm
a
moment
may
precede
one
that
shall
thrill
the
world
forever
to
that
still
moment
none
would
heed
man
doom
was
linked
no
more
to
sever
in
the
solemn
midnight
centuries
ago
it
is
the
calm
and
solemn
night
a
thousand
bells
ring
out
and
throw
their
joyous
peals
abroad
and
smite
the
darkness
charmed
and
holy
now
the
night
that
erst
no
name
had
worn
to
it
a
happy
name
is
given
for
in
that
stable
lay
the
peaceful
prince
of
earth
and
heaven
in
the
solemn
midnight
centuries
ago
my
slain
this
sweet
child
which
hath
climbed
upon
my
knee
this
little
maid
with
her
unconscious
beauty
troubleth
me
with
her
low
prattle
maketh
me
afraid
ah
darling
when
you
cling
and
nestle
so
you
hurt
me
though
you
do
not
see
me
cry
nor
hear
the
weariness
with
which
i
sigh
for
the
dear
babe
i
killed
so
long
ago
i
tremble
at
the
touch
of
your
caress
i
am
not
worthy
of
your
innocent
faith
i
who
with
whetted
knives
of
worldliness
did
put
my
own
to
death
beside
whose
grave
i
pace
forevermore
like
desolation
on
a
shipwrecked
shore
there
is
no
little
child
within
me
now
to
sing
back
to
the
thrushes
to
leap
up
when
june
winds
kiss
me
when
an
apple
bough
laughs
into
blossoms
or
a
buttercup
plays
with
the
sunshine
or
a
violet
dances
in
the
glad
dew
alas
alas
the
meaning
of
the
daisies
in
the
grass
i
have
forgotten
and
if
my
cheeks
are
wet
it
is
not
with
the
blitheness
of
the
child
but
with
the
bitter
sorrow
of
sad
years
o
moaning
life
with
life
irreconciled
o
thought
o
pain
o
tears
for
us
there
is
not
any
silver
sound
of
rhythmic
wonders
springing
from
the
ground
woe
worth
the
knowledge
and
the
bookish
lore
which
makes
men
mummies
weighs
out
every
grain
of
that
which
was
miraculous
before
and
sneers
the
heart
down
with
the
scoffing
brain
woe
worth
the
peering
analytic
days
that
dry
the
tender
juices
in
the
breast
and
put
the
thunders
of
the
lord
to
test
so
that
no
marvel
must
be
and
no
praise
nor
any
god
except
necessity
what
can
ye
give
my
poor
starved
life
in
lieu
of
this
dead
cherub
which
i
slew
for
ye
take
back
your
doubtful
wisdom
and
renew
my
early
foolish
freshness
of
the
dunce
whose
simple
instincts
guessed
the
heavens
at
once
the
undiscovered
country
could
we
but
know
the
land
that
ends
our
dark
uncertain
travel
where
lie
those
happier
hills
and
meadows
low
ah
if
beyond
the
spirit
inmost
cavil
aught
of
that
country
could
we
surely
know
who
would
not
go
might
we
but
hear
the
hovering
angels
high
imagined
chorus
or
catch
betimes
with
wakeful
eyes
and
clear
one
radiant
vista
of
the
realm
before
us
with
one
rapt
moment
given
to
see
and
hear
ah
who
would
fear
were
we
quite
sure
to
find
the
peerless
friend
who
left
us
lonely
or
there
by
some
celestial
stream
as
pure
to
gaze
in
eyes
that
here
were
lovelit
only
this
weary
mortal
coil
were
we
quite
sure
who
would
endure
clarence
my
psalm
i
mourn
no
more
my
vanished
years
beneath
a
tender
rain
an
april
rain
of
smiles
and
tears
my
heart
is
young
again
the
blow
and
singing
low
i
hear
the
glad
streams
run
the
windows
of
my
soul
i
throw
wide
open
to
the
sun
no
longer
forward
nor
behind
i
look
in
hope
and
fear
but
grateful
take
the
good
i
find
the
best
of
now
and
here
i
plough
no
more
a
desert
land
to
harvest
weed
and
tare
the
manna
dropping
from
god
hand
rebukes
my
painful
care
i
break
my
i
lay
aside
the
toiling
oar
the
angel
sought
so
far
away
i
welcome
at
my
door
the
airs
of
spring
may
never
play
among
the
ripening
corn
nor
freshness
of
the
flowers
of
may
blow
through
the
autumn
morn
yet
shall
the
gentian
look
through
fringéd
lids
to
heaven
and
the
pale
aster
in
the
brook
shall
see
its
image
given
the
woods
shall
wear
their
robes
of
praise
the
softly
sigh
and
sweet
calm
days
in
golden
haze
melt
down
the
amber
sky
not
less
shall
manly
deed
and
word
rebuke
an
age
of
wrong
the
graven
flowers
that
wreathe
the
sword
make
not
the
blade
less
strong
but
smiting
hands
shall
learn
to
heal
to
build
as
to
destroy
nor
less
my
heart
for
others
feel
that
i
the
more
enjoy
all
as
god
wills
who
wisely
heeds
to
give
or
to
withhold
and
knoweth
more
of
all
my
needs
than
all
my
prayers
have
told
enough
that
blessings
undeserved
have
marked
my
erring
track
that
my
feet
have
swerved
his
chastening
turned
me
back
that
more
and
more
a
providence
of
love
is
understood
making
the
springs
of
time
and
sense
sweet
with
eternal
good
that
death
seems
but
a
covered
way
which
opens
into
light
wherein
no
blinded
child
can
stray
beyond
the
father
sight
that
care
and
trial
seem
at
last
through
memory
sunset
air
like
mountain
ranges
overpast
in
purple
distance
fair
that
all
the
jarring
notes
of
life
seem
blending
in
a
psalm
and
all
the
angles
of
its
strife
slow
rounding
into
calm
and
so
the
shadows
fell
apart
and
so
the
play
and
all
the
windows
of
my
heart
i
open
to
the
day
greenleaf
enticed
i
with
what
clear
guile
of
gracious
love
enticed
i
follow
forward
as
from
room
to
room
through
doors
that
open
into
light
from
gloom
to
find
and
lose
and
find
again
the
christ
he
stands
and
knocks
and
bids
me
ope
the
door
without
he
stands
and
asks
to
enter
in
why
should
he
seek
a
shelter
sad
with
sin
will
he
but
knock
and
ask
and
nothing
more
he
knows
what
ways
i
take
to
shut
my
heart
and
if
he
will
he
can
himself
undo
my
foolish
fastenings
or
by
force
break
through
nor
wait
till
i
fulfil
my
needless
part
but
nay
he
will
not
choose
to
enter
so
he
will
not
be
my
guest
without
consent
nor
though
i
say
come
in
is
he
content
i
must
arise
and
ope
or
he
will
go
he
shall
not
go
i
do
arise
and
ope
come
in
dear
lord
come
in
and
sup
with
me
o
blesséd
guest
and
let
me
sup
with
thee
where
is
the
door
for
in
this
dark
i
grope
and
can
not
find
it
soon
enough
my
hand
shut
hard
holds
fast
the
one
sure
key
i
need
and
trembles
shaken
with
its
eager
heed
no
other
key
will
answer
my
demand
the
door
between
is
some
command
undone
obedience
is
the
key
that
slides
the
bar
and
lets
him
in
who
stands
so
near
so
far
the
doors
are
many
but
the
key
is
one
which
door
dear
lord
knock
speak
that
i
may
know
hark
heart
he
answers
with
his
hand
and
voice
o
still
small
sign
i
tremble
and
rejoice
nor
longer
doubt
which
way
my
feet
must
go
full
lief
and
soon
this
door
would
open
too
if
once
my
key
might
find
the
narrow
slit
which
being
so
narrow
is
so
hard
to
hit
but
lo
one
little
ray
that
glimmers
through
not
spreading
light
but
lighting
to
the
light
now
steady
hand
for
good
speed
sake
be
slow
one
straight
right
aim
a
pulse
of
pressure
so
how
small
how
great
the
change
from
dark
to
bright
ii
now
he
is
here
i
seem
no
longer
here
this
place
of
light
is
not
my
chamber
dim
it
is
not
he
with
me
but
i
with
him
and
host
not
guest
he
breaks
the
bread
of
cheer
i
was
borne
onward
at
his
greeting
he
earthward
had
come
but
heavenward
i
had
gone
drawing
him
hither
i
was
thither
drawn
scarce
welcoming
him
to
hear
him
welcome
me
i
lie
upon
the
bosom
of
my
lord
and
feel
his
heart
and
time
my
heart
thereby
the
tune
so
sweet
i
have
no
need
to
try
but
rest
and
trust
and
beat
the
perfect
chord
a
little
while
i
lie
upon
his
heart
feasting
on
love
and
loving
there
to
feast
and
then
once
more
the
shadows
are
increased
around
me
and
i
feel
my
lord
depart
again
alone
but
in
a
farther
place
i
sit
with
darkness
waiting
for
a
sign
again
i
hear
the
same
sweet
plea
divine
and
suit
outside
of
hospitable
grace
this
is
his
guile
he
makes
me
act
the
host
to
shelter
him
and
lo
he
shelters
me
asking
for
alms
he
summons
me
to
be
a
guest
at
banquets
of
the
holy
ghost
so
on
and
on
through
many
an
opening
door
that
gladly
opens
to
the
key
i
bring
from
brightening
court
to
court
of
christ
my
king
i
journey
evermore
at
last
i
trust
these
changing
scenes
will
cease
there
is
a
court
i
hear
where
he
abides
no
door
beyond
that
further
glory
my
host
at
home
all
change
is
changed
to
peace
weariness
o
little
feet
that
such
long
years
must
wander
on
through
hopes
and
fears
must
ache
and
bleed
beneath
your
load
i
nearer
to
the
wayside
inn
where
toil
shall
cease
and
rest
begin
am
weary
thinking
of
your
road
o
little
hands
that
weak
or
strong
have
still
to
serve
or
rule
so
long
have
still
so
long
to
give
or
ask
i
who
so
much
with
book
and
pen
have
toiled
among
my
am
weary
thinking
of
your
task
o
little
hearts
that
throb
and
beat
with
such
impatient
feverish
heat
such
limitless
and
strong
desires
mine
that
so
long
has
glowed
and
burned
with
passions
into
ashes
turned
now
covers
and
conceals
its
fires
o
little
souls
as
pure
and
white
and
crystalline
as
rays
of
light
direct
from
heaven
their
source
divine
refracted
through
the
mist
of
years
how
red
my
setting
sun
appears
how
lurid
looks

soul

tell
me
at
what
age

your
blue
eyes
have
scarcely
seen
summers
three
my
fairy
queen
but
a
miracle
of
sweets
soft
approaches
sly
retreats
show
the
little
archer
there
hidden
in
your
pretty
hair
when
didst
learn
a
heart
to
win

do
your

hoary
love
expire
when
do
frosts

the
voiceless

count
the
broken
lyres

rest
where
the

wailing
singers
slumber

their
silent

who
will
stoop
to

noisy
fame
is
proud
to

alas
for
those
who
never
sing
but
die
with
all
their
music
in
them
nay
grieve
not
for
the
dead
alone
whose
song
has
told
their
hearts
sad
story
weep
for
the
voiceless
who
have
known
the
cross
without
the
crown
of
glory
not
where
leucadian
breezes
sweep
sappho

where
the
glistening

nameless

o
hearts
that
break
and
give
no
sign

whitening
lip
and
fading
tresses

death
pours
out
his
cordial
wine
from
misery
crushing
presses
if
singing
