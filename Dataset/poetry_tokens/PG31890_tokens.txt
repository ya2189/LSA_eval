with

we

i
answered
then
have
i
no
heart
for

must
we
not
cross
the

unto

upon

failing
fall
into

and
die
so
for

glories
of

sigh
some
and
some
for
the
prophet
paradise
to
come
but
you
friend
take
the
cash
the
credit
leave
nor
heed
the
rumble
of
a
distant
drum
what
take
the
cash
and
let
the
credit
go
spend
all
upon
the
wine
the
while
i
know
a
possible
may
bring
thirst
for
drink
but
credit
then
shall
cause
to
flow
make
the
most
of
what
you
yet
may
spend
before
we
too
into
the
dust
descend
dust
into
dust
and
under
dust
to
lie
sans
wine
sans
song
sans
singer
and
sans
end
into
the
dust
we
shall
descend
we
must
but
can
the
soul
not
break
the
crumbling
crust
in
which
he
is
encaged
to
hope
or
to
despair
he
will
which
is
more
wise
or
just
worldly
hope
men
set
their
hearts
upon
turns
ashes
or
it
prospers
and
anon
like
snow
upon
the
desert
dusty
face
lighting
a
little
hour
or
two
is
like
snow
it
comes
to
cool
one
burning
day
and
like
it
goes
for
all
our
plea
or
sway
but
flooding
tears
nor
wine
can
ever
purge
the
vision
it
has
brought
to
us
away
to
this
world
we
come
and
why
not
knowing
nor
whence
like
water
flowing
and
out
of
it
as
wind
along
the
waste
we
know
not
whither
true
little
do
we
know
of
or
but
is
forsooth
our
darkness
evidence
there
is
no
light
the
worm
may
see
no
star
tho
heaven
with
myriad
multitudes
be
dense
all
unasked
we
hither
hurried
whence
and
all
unasked
we
whither
hurried
hence
o
many
a
cup
of
this
forbidden
wine
must
drown
the
memory
of
that
yet
can
not
ever
for
it
is
forbid
still
by
that
quenchless
soul
within
us
hid
which
cries
feed
me
not
on
wine
alone
for
to
immortal
banquets
i
am
bid
oft
i
think
that
never
blows
so
red
the
rose
as
where
some
buried
cæsar
bled
that
every
hyacinth
the
garden
wears
dropt
in
her
lap
from
some
once
lovely
then
if
from
the
dull
clay
thro
with
life
throes
more
beautiful
spring
hyacinth
and
rose
will
the
great
gardener
for
the
uprooted
soul
find
use
no
sweeter
than
useless
repose
can
not
know
so
fill
the
cup
that
clears
of
past
regret
and
future
fears
why
we
may
be
ourselves
with
yesterday
thousand
no
cup
there
is
to
bring
oblivion
more
during
than
regret
and
fear
no
none
for
wine
that
wine
may
change
and
be
marah
before
sands
have
run
when
young
did
eagerly
frequent
doctor
and
saint
and
heard
great
argument
about
it
and
about
but
evermore
came
out
by
the
same
door
where
in
i
the
doors
of
argument
may
lead
nowhither
reason
become
a
prison
where
may
wither
from
sunless
eyes
the
infinite
from
hearts
all
hope
when
their
sojourn
too
long
is
thither
from
earth
centre
thro
the
seventh
gate
i
rose
and
on
the
throne
of
saturn
sate
and
many
a
knot
unravelled
by
the
road
but
not
the
of
human
the
knows
but
the
that
scattered
saturn
and
his
countless
band
like
seeds
upon
the
unplanted
heaven
air
the
truth
we
reap
from
them
is
chaff
thrice
fanned
if
the
soul
can
fling
the
dust
aside
and
naked
on
the
air
of
heaven
ride
not
a
shame
not
a
shame
for
him
in
this
clay
carcase
crippled
to
abide
no
for
a
day
bound
in
this
dust
may
teach
more
of
the
sáki
mind
than
we
can
reach
through
æons
mounting
still
from
sky
to
sky
may
open
through
all
mystery
a
breach
speak
as
if
existence
closing
your
account
and
mine
should
know
the
like
no
more
the
eternal
sáki
from
that
bowl
has
poured
millions
of
bubbles
like
us
and
will
bubbles
we
are
pricked
by
the
point
of
death
but
in
each
bubble
may
there
be
no
breath
that
lifts
it
and
at
last
to
freedom
flies
and
all
heights
of
heaven
wandereth
moment
halt
a
momentary
taste
of
being
from
the
well
amid
the
waste
and
lo
the
phantom
caravan
has
reached
the
nothing
it
set
out
from
oh
make
haste
and
yet
it
should
be
it
should
be
that
we
who
drink
shall
drink
of
immortality
the
master
of
the
well
has
much
to
spare
will
he
say
then
shall
we
no
more
be
moving
finger
writes
and
having
writ
moves
on
nor
all
your
piety
nor
wit
shall
lure
it
back
to
cancel
half
a
line
nor
all
your
tears
wash
out
a
word
of
and
were
it
other
might
we
not
erase
the
letter
of
some
sorrow
in
whose
place
no
truer
sounding
we
should
fail
to
spell
the
heart
which
yearns
behind
the
face
this
i
know
whether
the
one
true
light
kindle
to
love
or
me
quite
one
flash
of
it
within
the
tavern
caught
better
than
in
the
temple
lost
in
temple
or
in
tavern
may
be
lost
and
everywhere
that
love
hath
any
cost
it
may
be
found
the
wrath
it
seems
is
but
a
cloud
whose
dew
should
make
its
power
most
see
his
presence
thro
creation
veins
running
eludes
your
pains
taking
all
shapes
from
máh
to
máhi
and
they
change
and
perish
all
but
he
all
it
may
be
yet
lie
to
sleep
and
lo
the
soul
seems
quenched
in
darkness
is
it
so
rather
believe
what
seemeth
not
than
seems
of
death
until
we
know
we
wastes
the
hour
gone
in
the
vain
pursuit
of
this
and
that
we
strive
and
dispute
better
be
jocund
with
the
fruitful
grape
than
sadden
after
none
or
bitter
better
unless
we
hope
that
grief
is
thrown
across
our
path
by
urgence
of
the
unknown
lest
we
may
think
we
have
no
more
to
live
and
bide
content
with
earth
alone
strange
not
that
of
the
myriads
who
before
us
passed
the
door
of
darkness
through
not
one
returns
to
tell
us
of
the
road
which
to
discover
we
must
travel
too
such
is
the
ban
but
even
though
we
heard
love
in
life
all
we
still
should
crave
the
word
of
one
returned
yet
none
is
we
know
though
they
lie
deep
they
are
by
death
deterred
then
thy
soul
through
the
invisible
some
letter
of
the
to
spell
and
by
and
by
thy
soul
returned
to
thee
but
answers
myself
am
heaven
and
hell
from
the
invisible
he
does
but
sent
thro
earth
where
living
goodness
tho
is
blent
with
evil
dures
may
he
not
read
the
voice
make
thee
but
for
death
were
toil
ill
spent
when
the
angel
of
the
darker
drink
at
last
shall
find
us
by
the
and
offering
his
cup
invite
our
souls
forth
to
our
lips
to
quaff
we
shall
not
no
but
if
in
the
sable
cup
we
knew
death
without
waking
were
the
wilful
brew
nobler
it
were
to
curse
as
coward
him
who
roused
us
into
light
then
light
withdrew
thou
who
didst
with
pitfall
and
with
gin
beset
the
road
i
was
to
wander
in
thou
wilt
not
with
predestined
evil
round
enmesh
and
then
impute
my
fall
to
he
will
not
if
one
evil
we
endure
to
ultimate
debasing
oh
be
sure
is
not
of
him
predestined
and
the
sin
not
his
nor
ours
but
fate
he
could
not
cure
ah
that
spring
should
vanish
with
the
rose
that
youth
manuscript
should
close
the
nightingale
that
on
the
branches
sang
ah
whence
and
whither
flown
again
who
knows
so
does
it
seem
no
other
joys
like
these
yet
summer
comes
and
autumn
honoured
ease
and
wintry
age
ever
whisperless
of
that
last
spring
whose
verdure
may
not
cease
would
some
winged
angel
ere
too
late
arrest
the
yet
unfolded
roll
of
fate
and
make
the
stern
recorder
otherwise
enregister
or
quite
obliterate
to
otherwise
enregister
believe
he
toils
eternally
nor
asks
reprieve
and
could
creation
perfect
from
his
hands
have
come
at
dawn
none
overmuch
should
grieve
so
till
the
wan
and
early
scent
of
day
we
strove
and
silent
turned
at
last
away
thinking
how
men
in
ages
yet
unborn
would
ask
and
answer
trust
and
doubt
and
pray
jael
jehovah
jehovah
art
thou
not
stronger
than
gods
of
the
heathen
i
slew
him
that
sisera
prince
of
the
host
thou
dost
hate
but
fear
of
his
blood
is
upon
me
about
me
is
breathen
his
spirit
by
night
and
by
day
come
voices
that
wait
athirst
and
affrightened
he
fled
from
the
waters
of
kishon
his
face
was
as
wool
when
he
swooned
at
the
door
of
my
tent
the
lord
hath
given
him
into
the
hand
of
perdition
i
smiled
but
he
saw
not
the
face
of
my
cunning
intent
he
thirsted
for
water
i
fed
him
the
curdless
milk
of
the
cattle
he
lay
in
the
tent
under
purple
and
crimson
of
tyre
he
slept
and
he
dreamt
of
the
surge
and
storming
of
battle
ah
ha
but
he
woke
not
to
waken
jehovah
ire
he
slept
as
he
were
a
chosen
of
israel
god
almighty
a
dog
out
of
canaan
thought
he
i
was
woman
alone
i
slipt
like
an
asp
to
his
ear
and
laughed
for
the
sight
he
would
give
when
the
carrion
kites
should
tear
to
his
bone
i
smote
thro
his
temple
the
nail
to
the
dust
a
worm
did
i
bind
him
my
heart
was
with
rage
and
with
scorn
and
i
danced
with
a
holy
delight
before
and
behind
him
i
that
am
called
blessèd
all
unto
judah
born
aye
come
i
will
show
thee
o
barak
a
woman
is
more
than
a
warrior
i
cried
as
i
lifted
the
door
wherein
sisera
lay
to
me
did
he
fly
and
i
shall
be
called
his
destroyer
i
jael
who
am
subtle
to
find
for
the
lord
a
way
above
all
the
daughters
of
men
be
blest
of
gilead
or
asshur
sang
deborah
prophetess
then
from
her
waving
palm
behold
her
ye
people
behold
her
the
heathen
abasher
behold
her
the
lord
hath
uplifted
behold
and
be
calm
the
mother
of
him
at
the
window
looks
out
thro
the
lattice
to
listen
why
roll
not
the
wheels
of
his
chariot
why
does
he
stay
shall
he
not
return
with
the
booty
of
battle
and
glisten
in
songs
of
his
triumph
ye
women
why
do
ye
not
say
and
i
was
as
she
who
danced
when
the
seas
were
rended
asunder
and
stood
until
egypt
pressed
in
to
be
drowned
unto
death
my
breasts
were
as
fire
with
the
glory
the
rocks
that
were
under
my
feet
grew
quick
with
the
gloating
that
beat
in
my
breath
at
night
i
stole
out
where
they
cast
him
a
sop
to
the
jackal
and
raven
but
his
bones
stood
up
in
the
moon
and
i
shook
with
affright
the
strength
shrank
out
of
my
limbs
and
i
fell
a
craven
before
him
the
nail
in
his
temple
gleamed
bloodily
bright
jehovah
jehovah
art
thou
not
stronger
than
gods
of
the
heathen
i
slew
him
that
sisera
prince
of
the
host
thou
dost
hate
but
fear
of
his
blood
is
upon
me
about
me
is
breathen
his
spirit
by
day
and
by
night
come
voices
that
wait
i
fly
to
the
desert
i
fly
to
the
mountain
but
they
will
not
hide
me
his
gods
haunt
the
winds
and
the
caves
with
vengeance
that
cries
for
judgment
upon
me
the
stars
in
their
courses
deride
me
the
stars
thou
hast
hung
with
a
breath
in
the
wandering
skies
jehovah
jehovah
i
slew
him
the
scourge
and
sting
of
thy
nation
take
from
me
his
spirit
take
from
me
the
voice
of
his
blood
with
madness
i
rave
by
day
and
by
night
defamation
jehovah
release
me
jehovah
if
still
thou
art
god
to
the
sea
art
thou
enraged
o
sea
with
the
blue
peace
of
heaven
so
to
uplift
thine
armèd
waves
thy
billowing
rebellion
its
ease
and
with
tartarean
mutter
from
cold
caves
from
shuddering
profundities
where
shapes
of
awe
glide
thro
entangled
leagues
of
ooze
to
hoot
thy
watery
omens
evermore
and
evermore
thy
moanings
interfuse
with
seething
necromancy
and
mad
lore
or
dost
thou
labour
with
the
drifting
bones
of
countless
dead
thou
mighty
alchemist
within
whose
stormy
crucible
the
stones
of
sunk
primordial
shores
granite
and
schist
are
crumbled
by
thine
beat
with
immemorial
chanting
to
the
moon
and
cosmic
incantation
dost
thou
crave
rest
to
be
found
not
till
thy
wild
be
strewn
frigid
and
desert
over
earth
last
grave
thou
seemest
with
immensity
mad
blind
with
raving
deaf
with
wandering
forlorn
parent
of
demogorgon
whose
dire
mind
is
night
and
earthquake
shapeless
shame
and
scorn
of
the
birth
of
harmony
bound
in
thy
briny
bed
and
gnawing
earth
with
foamy
writhing
and
tides
thou
art
as
fate
in
torment
of
a
dearth
of
black
disaster
and
destruction
strides
and
how
thou
dost
drive
silence
from
the
world
incarnate
motion
of
all
mystery
whose
waves
are
whose
winds
are
hurled
whither
thy
ghost
tempestuous
can
see
a
desolate
apocalypse
of
death
oh
how
thou
dost
drive
silence
from
the
world
with
emerald
overflowing
waste
on
waste
of
flashing
susurration
dashed
and
swirled
isles
and
continents
that
shrink
abased
nay
frustrate
hope
art
thou
of
the
unknown
gathered
from
primal
mist
and
firmament
a
surging
shape
of
life
unfathomed
moan
whelming
humanity
with
fears
unmeant
yet
do
i
love
thee
o
above
all
fear
and
loving
thee
unconquerably
trust
the
runes
that
from
thy
ageless
surfing
start
would
read
were
they
revealed
gust
upon
gust
that
immortality
is
might
of
heart
the
so
wan
so
unavailing
across
the
vacant
dimly
trailing
last
night
sphered
in
thy
shining
a
circe
mystic
destinies
divining
but
as
a
feather
torn
from
a
seraph
wing
in
sinful
weather
from
the
portals
of
paradise
unto
the
land
of
mortals
yet
do
i
feel
thee
awing
my
heart
with
mystery
as
thy
updrawing
moves
thro
the
tides
of
ocean
and
leaves
lorn
beaches
barren
of
its
motion
or
strands
upon
near
shallows
the
wreck
whose
weirded
form
at
night
unhallows
the
fisher
maiden
prayers
for
that
storms
may
take
not
unawares
so
wan
so
unavailing
across
the
vacant
dimly
trailing
but
night
shall
come
atoning
thy
phantom
life
thro
day
and
high
enthroning
thee
in
her
chambers
arrased
with
leave
thee
unharassed
to
glide
with
silvery
passion
till
in
earth
shadow
swept
thy
glowings
ashen
a
oh
go
in
from
the
sea
and
furl
your
wings
the
bay
is
gray
with
the
twilit
spray
and
the
loud
surf
springs
the
chill
is
rung
by
the
hands
of
all
the
drowned
who
know
the
woe
of
the
wind
and
tow
of
the
tides
around
go
in
go
in
oh
haste
from
the
sea
and
let
them
rest
a
son
and
one
who
was
wed
and
one
who
went
down
unblest
aye
even
as
i
whose
hands
at
the
bell
now
labour
most
the
tomb
has
gloom
but
oh
the
doom
of
the
drear
he
evermore
must
wander
the
ooze
beneath
the
wave
forlorn
to
warn
of
the
tempest
born
and
to
save
to
save
then
go
go
in
and
leave
us
the
sea
for
only
so
can
peace
release
us
and
give
us
ease
of
our
salty
woe
on
the
moor
i
met
a
child
upon
the
moor
down
the
heather
she
put
her
hand
into
my
own
we
crossed
the
fields
together
i
led
her
to
her
father
door
a
cottage
mid
the
clover
i
left
her
and
the
world
grew
poor
to
me
a
childless
rover
i
met
a
maid
upon
the
moor
the
morrow
was
her
wedding
love
lit
her
eyes
with
lovelier
hues
than
the
was
shedding
she
looked
a
sweet
to
me
and
the
stile
went
singing
down
all
the
lonely
night
i
heard
but
bridal
bells
i
met
a
mother
on
the
moor
by
a
new
grave
the
happy
swallows
in
the
blue
upon
the
winds
were
playing
would
i
were
in
his
grave
i
said
and
he
beside
her
standing
there
was
no
heart
to
break
if
death
for
me
had
made
demanding
the
cry
of
eve
down
the
from
eden
in
the
lay
dreaming
eve
by
her
outdriven
mate
pillowed
on
lilies
that
still
told
the
sweet
of
birth
within
the
garden
ecstasy
pitiful
round
her
face
that
could
not
lose
its
memory
of
god
perfecting
was
strewn
her
troubled
hair
and
sigh
grieved
after
sigh
along
her
loveliness
in
the
white
moon
then
sudden
her
dream
too
cruelly
impent
with
pain
broke
and
a
cry
fled
shuddering
into
the
wounded
stillness
from
her
lips
as
cold
she
fearfully
felt
for
his
hand
and
tears
that
had
before
visited
her
lids
with
anguish
drew
from
her
the
moan
oh
adam
what
have
i
dreamed
now
do
i
understand
his
words
so
dim
to
creatures
that
had
quivered
but
with
bliss
since
at
the
dusk
thy
kiss
to
me
and
i
wept
at
caresses
that
were
once
all
joy
i
have
slept
seeing
through
futurity
the
uncreated
ages
visibly
foresuffering
phantoms
crowded
in
the
womb
of
time
and
all
with
lamentable
mien
accusing
without
mercy
thee
and
me
and
without
pity
for
tho
some
were
far
from
birth
and
without
name
others
were
near
sodom
and
dark
gomorrah
from
whose
flames
fleeing
one
turned
how
like
her
look
to
mine
when
the
tree
horror
trembled
on
my
taste
and
babylon
upbuilded
on
our
sin
and
nineveh
a
city
sinking
slow
under
a
shroud
of
sandy
centuries
that
hid
me
not
from
the
buried
cursing
eyes
of
women
who
gave
birth
ah
to
be
mother
of
all
misery
to
be
out
of
the
earth
and
fail
for
a
whole
world
to
shame
maternity
for
women
evermore
women
whose
tears
flooding
the
night
no
hope
can
wipe
away
to
see
the
wings
of
death
as
adam
thou
hast
not
endlessly
beating
and
to
hear
the
swooning
ages
suffer
up
to
god
and
oh
that
of
a
guiltless
child
in
it
are
sounding
of
our
sin
and
woe
with
prophesy
of
ill
beyond
all
years
yearning
for
beauty
never
to
be
seen
beatitude
redeemless
evermore
and
i
whose
dream
mourned
with
all
motherhood
must
hear
it
soon
already
do
soft
skill
assuasive
lulls
enticings
and
quick
tones
of
tenderness
that
will
like
light
awake
the
folded
memory
children
shall
bring
out
of
the
dark
move
in
me
longingly
yet
thou
adam
dear
fallen
thought
of
god
thou
when
thou
too
shall
hear
humanity
cry
in
thy
child
wilt
groaning
wish
the
world
back
in
unsummoned
void
and
woe
wilt
fill
god
ear
with
troubled
wonder
and
unrest
softly
he
soothed
her
straying
hair
and
kissed
the
fever
from
her
lips
over
the
palms
the
sad
moon
poured
her
peace
into
their
eyes
till
sleep
the
angel
of
forgetfulness
folded
again
dark
wings
above
their
rest
mary
at
nazareth
i
know
lord
thou
hast
sent
him
thou
art
so
good
to
me
but
thou
hast
only
lent
him
his
heart
for
thee
i
dared
thy
poor
not
ask
a
only
a
laden
for
earth
and
mild
but
this
one
thou
hast
given
seems
not
for
earth
or
me
his
lips
flame
truth
from
heaven
and
vanity
seem
all
my
thoughts
and
prayers
when
he
but
speaks
thy
law
out
of
my
heart
the
tares
are
torn
by
awe
i
can
not
look
upon
him
so
strangely
burn
his
eyes
hath
not
some
grieving
drawn
him
from
paradise
for
thee
for
thee
i
live
lord
yet
oft
i
almost
fall
before
him
oh
forgive
lord
my
sinful
thrall
but
when
he
was
nursing
a
baby
at
my
breast
it
seemed
he
was
dispersing
the
world
unrest
thou
me
call
him
jesus
and
from
our
heavy
sin
i
know
he
shall
release
us
from
sheol
win
but
lord
forgive
the
yearning
that
he
may
sometimes
be
like
other
children
learning
beside
my
knee
or
playing
prattling
seeking
for
help
comes
to
my
heart
ah
sinful
lord
i
speaking
how
good
thou
art
adelil
proud
adelil
proud
adelil
why
does
she
lie
so
cold
i
made
her
shrink
i
made
her
reel
i
made
her
white
lids
fold
we
sat
at
banquet
many
maids
she
like
a
valkyr
free
i
hated
the
glitter
of
her
braids
i
hated
her
blue
eye
glee
in
emerald
cups
was
poured
the
mead
icily
blew
the
night
but
tears
unshed
and
woes
that
bleed
brew
bitterness
and
spite
a
goblet
to
my
love
she
cried
prince
where
the
fly
her
love
it
was
for
that
he
died
and
for
it
she
should
die
she
lifted
the
cup
and
drank
she
saw
a
heart
within
its
lees
i
laughed
like
the
dead
who
feel
the
thaw
of
summer
in
the
breeze
they
looked
upon
her
stricken
still
and
sudden
they
grew
appalled
it
is
thy
lover
heart
i
shrill
as
the
to
her
called
palely
she
took
it
did
it
give
ease
there
against
her
breast
dead
dead
she
swooned
but
i
can
not
live
and
dead
i
shall
not
rest
intimation
all
night
i
smiled
as
i
slept
for
i
heard
the
feel
blindly
about
in
the
trees
without
for
buds
to
heal
all
night
in
dreams
for
i
smelt
in
the
woods
and
fields
the
coming
flowers
and
the
glad
green
hours
that
summer
yields
all
night
and
when
at
dawn
i
woke
with
the
cheep
winter
with
all
its
chill
and
pall
seemed
but
a
sleep
in
july
this
path
will
tell
me
where
dark
daisies
dance
to
the
white
sycamores
that
dell
them
in
where
crow
and
flicker
cry
melodious
din
and
blackberries
in
ebon
ripeness
glance
luscious
enticings
under
briery
green
it
will
slip
under
coppice
limbs
that
lean
brushingly
as
the
heifer
pants
toward
weedy
that
shade
the
creek
reluctant
trance
i
shall
find
spires
beside
the
gap
and
lady
phlox
within
the
hollow
cool
cedar
with
sudden
memories
of
yule
above
the
tangle
tipped
with
blue
skullcap
the
high
hot
mullein
fond
of
the
full
sun
will
watch
and
tell
the
low
mint
when
i
won
the
hither
wheat
where
idle
breezes
nap
and
fluffy
quails
entrap
me
from
their
brood
that
crouch
to
escape
mishap
then
i
shall
reach
the
mossy
that
gullies
the
dense
hill
up
to
its
peak
there
dally
listening
to
the
eerie
eke
of
drops
into
cool
chalices
of
clay
then
on
for
elders
odorously
will
steal
my
senses
till
i
climb
up
where
they
heal
the
livid
heat
of
its
malingering
ray
and
wooingly
betray
to
memory
many
a
day
there
i
shall
rest
within
the
woody
peace
of
afternoon
the
bending
azure
frothed
with
silveryness
the
sunny
pastures
swathed
fragrant
with
clover
and
the
hills
where
hung
mists
muse
and
silence
calls
to
solitude
thro
aged
forest
halls
will
waft
into
me
their
mysterious
ease
and
in
the
wind
soft
cease
i
shall
hear
hintings
of
eternities
from
above
what
do
i
care
if
the
trees
are
bare
and
the
hills
are
dark
and
the
skies
are
gray
what
do
i
care
for
chill
in
the
air
for
crows
that
cark
at
the
rough
wind
way
what
do
i
care
for
the
dead
leaves
there

the
sullen
road
by
the
sullen
wood

my

bear
my

with
loneliness
that
will

under

it
came
with

stealing
aimlessly
about

came

set
sails
vanishing
and
slow
in
the
blue
west
the
mountains
hide
as
visions
that
too
soon
will
go
across
the
flooded
deep
the
peasant
peacefully
wades
on
as
in
unfurrowed
vales
of
sleep
a
phantom
out
of
voidness
drawn
over
the
temple
cawing
flies
the
crow
with
carrion
in
his
beak
buddha
within
lifts
not
his
eyes
in
pity
or
reproval
meek
nor
in
the
bamboos
where
they
bow
a
respite
from
the
blinding
sun
the
old
priest
dreaming
painless
how
nirvana
calm
will
come
when
won
all
is
illusion
all
the
world
of
will
the
spent
east
seems
whispering
in
me
and
the
call
of
life
is
but
a
call
of
dreams
a
japanese
mother
in
time
of
war
the
young
stork
sleeps
in
the
tops
down
on
the
brink
of
the
river
my
baby
sleeps
by
the
bamboo
copse
the
bamboo
copse
where
the
rice
field
stops
the
bamboos
sigh
and
shiver
the
white
fox
creeps
from
his
hole
in
the
hill
i
must
pray
to
inari
i
hear
her
calling
me
low
and
chill
low
and
chill
when
the
wind
is
still
at
night
and
the
skies
hang
starry
and
ever
she
says
he
dead
he
dead
your
lord
who
went
to
battle
how
shall
your
baby
now
be
fed
ukibo
fed
with
rice
and
bread
what
if
i
hush
his
prattle
the
red
moon
rises
as
i
slip
back
and
the
bamboo
stems
are
swaying
inari
was
deaf
and
yet
the
lack
the
fear
and
lack
are
gone
and
the
rack
i
know
not
why
with
praying
for
though
inari
cared
not
at
all
some
other
god
was
kinder
i
wonder
why
he
has
heard
my
call
my
giftless
call
and
what
shall
befall
hope
has
but
left
me
blinder
the
dead
gods
i
thought
i
plunged
into
that
dire
abyss
which
is
oblivion
the
house
of
death
i
thought
there
blew
upon
my
soul
the
breath
of
time
that
was
but
never
more
can
be
ten
thousand
years
within
its
void
i
thought
i
lay
blind
deaf
and
motionless
until
though
with
no
eye
nor
ear
i
felt
the
thrill
of
seeing
heard
its
phantoms
move
and
sigh
first
one
beside
me
spoke
in
tones
that
told
he
once
had
been
a
god
persephone
tear
from
thy
brow
its
withered
crown
for
we
are
king
and
queen
of
tartarus
no
more
and
that
wan
shrivelled
sceptre
in
thy
hand
why
dost
thou
clasp
it
still
cast
it
away
for
now
it
hath
no
virtue
that
can
sway
dull
shades
or
drive
the
furies
to
their
spoil
cast
it
away
and
give
thy
palm
to
mine
perchance
some
unobliterated
spark
of
memory
shall
warm
this
dismal
dark
perchance
vain
vain
love
could
not
light
such
gloom
he
sank
then
in
great
ruin
by
him
moved
another
as
in
travail
of
some
thought
near
unto
birth
and
soon
from
lips
distraught
by
aged
silence
fell
with
hollow
woe
ah
pluto
dost
thou
one
time
lord
of
styx
and
acheron
make
moan
of
night
and
cold
were
we
upon
olympus
as
of
old
laughter
of
thee
would
rock
its
festal
height
but
think
think
thee
of
me
to
whom
or
gloom
or
cold
were
more
unknown
than
impotence
see
the
unhurlèd
thunderbolt
brought
hence
to
mock
me
when
i
dream
i
still
am
jove
too
much
it
was
i
withered
in
the
breath
and
lay
again
ten
thousand
lifeless
years
and
then
my
soul
shook
woke
and
saw
three
biers
chiselled
of
solid
night
majestically
the
forms
outlaid
upon
them
were
enwound
as
with
the
silence
of
eternity
numbing
repose
dwelt
them
like
a
sea
that
long
hath
lost
tide
wave
and
roar
in
death
ptah
ammon
and
osiris
are
their
names
a
spirit
hieroglyphed
unto
my
soul
ptah
ammon
and
osiris
they
who
stole
the
heart
of
egypt
from
the
god
of
gods
aye
they
and
these
pointing
to
many
wraiths
that
stood
around
baal
ormuzd
indra
all
whom
frightened
ignorance
and
sin
appall
had
given
birth
in
despair
their
eyes
were
fixed
upon
a
cloven
slope
down
whose
descent
still
other
forms
from
earth
were
drawn
by
the
unceasing
mesh
of
time
to
their
irrevocable
end
they
are
the
gods
one
said
the
gods
whom
men
still
taunt
with
wails
for
help
then
a
deep
light
upbore
me
from
the
gulf
and
thro
its
might
i
heard
the
worlds
cry
god
alone
is
god
call
to
your
mate
o
call
to
your
mate
and
i
will
call
to
mine
call
to
her
by
the
and
i
will
call
by
the
pine
tell
her
the
sun
is
hid
the
windy
wheat
sways
west
whistle
again
call
clear
and
run
to
lure
her
out
of
her
nest
for
when
to
the
copse
she
comes
shy
bird
with
mary
down
the
lane
i
walk
in
the
dusk
of
the
locust
tops
and
be
her
lover
again
ay
we
will
forget
our
hearts
are
old
and
that
our
hair
is
gray
we
kiss
as
we
kissed
at
pale
sunset
that
summer
halcyon
day
that
day
can
it
fade
ah
bob
still
calling
calling
still
we
coming
bent
and
weighed
but
glad
with
the
old
love
thrill
the
dying
poet
swing
in
thy
splendour
o
silent
sun
drawing
my
heart
with
thee
over
the
west
done
is
its
day
as
thy
day
is
done
fallen
its
quest
swoon
into
purple
and
rose
then
die
tho
to
arise
again
out
of
the
dawn
die
as
i
praise
thee
ere
thro
the
dark
lie
of
death
i
am
drawn
sunk
art
thou
sunken
how
great
was
life
i
like
a
child
could
cry
for
it
again
cry
for
its
beauty
pang
fleeting
and
strife
its
women
its
men
for
how
i
drained
it
with
love
and
delight
opened
its
heart
with
the
magic
of
grief
reaped
every
season
its
day
and
its
night
loved
every
sheaf
aye
not
a
meadow
my
step
has
trod
never
a
flower
swung
sweet
to
my
face
never
a
heart
that
was
touched
of
god
but
taught
me
its
grace
off
from
my
lids
then
a
moment
yet
fingering
death
for
again
i
must
see
lifted
by
memory
all
that
i
met
under
time
lee
there
i
a
child
again
fair
so
fair
under
the
eyes
does
a
marvel
not
burn
speak
they
not
vision
and
frenzy
to
dare
that
still
in
me
yearn
youth
my
wild
youth
o
blood
of
my
heart
still
you
can
answer
with
swirling
the
thought
still
like
the
rapid
can
dart
joyous
distraught
love
and
her
face
again
there
by
the
wood
come
thou
invisible
dark
with
thy
mask
shall
i
not
learn
if
she
lives
and
could
i
more
of
thee
ask
turn
me
away
from
the
ashen
west
where
love
sad
planet
unveils
to
the
dusk
something
is
stealing
like
light
from
my
breast
soul
from
its
husk
soft
where
the
dead
feel
the
buried
dead
where
the
high
hourly
tolls
bury
me
near
to
the
haunting
tread
of
life
that
the
outcast
i
did
not
fear
but
crept
close
up
to
christ
and
said
is
he
not
here
they
drew
me
back
the
seraphs
who
had
never
bled
of
weary
lack
but
still
i
cried
with
torn
robe
clutching
at
his
feet
dear
christ
he
died
so
long
ago
is
he
not
here
three
days
unfleet
as
mortal
flow
of
time
i
sought
till
heaven
amaranthine
ways
seem
as
sere
nought
a
grieving
stole
up
from
his
heart
and
waned
the
gaze
of
his
clear
soul
into
my
eyes
he
is
not
here
troubled
he
sighed
for
none
who
dies
beliefless
may
bend
lips
to
this
tide
and
live
alway
then
darkness
rose
within
me
and
drear
bitterness
out
of
its
throes
i
moaned
at
last
let
me
go
hence
take
off
the
dress
the
charms
thou
hast
around
me
strown
beliefless
too
am
i
without
his
love
and
lone
unto
the
gate
they
led
me
tho
with
pitying
doubt
i
did
not
wait
but
stepped
across
its
portal
turned
not
once
to
heed
or
know
my
loss
then
my
dream
broke
and
with
it
every
loveless
creed
beneath
love
stroke
april
a
laughter
of
wind
and
a
leaping
of
cloud
and
april
oh
out
under
the
blue
the
brook
is
awake
and
the
blackbird
loud
in
the
dew
but
how
does
the
robin
high
in
the
beech
beside
the
wood
with
its
shake
and
toss
know
it
the
frenzy
of
bluets
to
reach
thro
the
moss
and
where
did
the
lark
ever
learn
his
speech
up
wildly
sweet
he
over
the
mead
is
more
than
the
rapture
of
earth
can
teach
in
its
creed
i
never
shall
know
i
never
shall
care
is
oh
enough
to
live
and
to
love
to
laugh
and
warble
and
dream
and
dare
are
to
prove
august
guests
the
wind
slipt
over
the
hill
and
down
the
valley
he
dimpled
the
cheek
of
the
rill
with
a
cooling
kiss
then
hid
on
the
bank
and
began
to
rally
the
rushes
oh
i
love
the
wind
for
this
a
cloud
blew
out
of
the
west
and
spilt
his
shower
upon
the
crest
and
the
clematis
then
over
the
virgin
corn
besprinkled
a
dower
of
and
i
love
the
cloud
for
this
to
a
dove
thy
mellow
passioning
amid
the
leaves
that
tremble
dimly
in
the
summer
dusk
falls
sad
along
the
oatland
sallow
sheaves
and
haunts
above
the
runnel
voice
with
plashy
willow
and
reed
the
solitude
dim
spell
it
breaketh
not
but
softer
mourns
unto
me
from
the
mead
than
airs
that
in
the
wood
intoning
start
or
breath
of
silences
in
dells
begot
to
soothe
some
soul
with
sin
a
votaress
art
thou
of
simplicity
who
hath
one
fane
the
heaven
above
thy
nest
one
incense
love
one
stealing
litany
of
peace
from
rivered
vale
and
upland
crest
yea
thou
art
hers
who
makes
prayer
of
the
breeze
hope
of
the
cool
upwelling
from
sweet
soils
faith
of
the
darkening
distance
charities
of
vesper
scents
and
of
the
throb
joy
whose
first
leaping
rends
the
coils
that
would
earth
of
its
heavenliness
rob
but
few
how
few
her
worshippers
for
we
cast
at
a
myriad
shrines
our
souls
to
rise
beliefless
unanointed
bound
not
free
to
sacrificing
a
vain
sacrifice
let
thy
lone
innocence
then
quickly
null
within
our
veins
and
wrong
desire
or
drugging
knowledge
that
but
fills
of
feverous
mystery
the
days
we
drain
be
thy
warm
notes
like
an
orphean
lyre
to
lead
us
to
life
arcady
again
at
tintern
abbey
june
o
tintern
tintern
evermore
my
dreams
troubled
by
thy
grave
beauty
shall
be
born
thy
crumbling
loveliness
and
ivy
streams
shall
speak
to
me
for
ever
from
this
morn
the
daws
about
thy
arches
drifting
clouds
sweeping
thy
ruin
to
the
sea
gray
tintern
all
the
hills
about
thee
lifting
their
misty
waving
woodland
verdancy
the
centuries
that
draw
thee
to
the
earth
in
envy
of
thy
desolated
charm
the
summers
and
the
winters
the
sky
girth
of
sunny
blue
or
bleakness
seek
thy
harm
but
would
that
i
were
time
then
only
tender
touch
upon
thee
should
fall
as
on
i
sped
of
every
pillar
would
i
be
defender
of
every
mossy
window
of
thy
dead
thy
dead
beneath
obliterated
stones
upon
the
sod
that
is
at
last
thy
floor
who
list
the
wye
not
as
it
lonely
moans
nor
heed
thy
gothic
shadows
grieving
o
tintern
tintern
where
never
are
wanting
mysteries
that
move
the
breast
i
hear
thy
beauty
calling
ah
for
ever
till
sinks
within
me
the
last
voice
to
rest
oh
go
not
out
oh
go
not
out
upon
the
storm
go
not
my
sweet
to
swalchie
pool
a
witch
tho
she
be
dead
may
charm
thee
and
befool
a
wild
night
is
her
lover
moan
down
under
ooze
and
salty
weed
she
make
thee
hear
and
then
her
own
till
thou
shalt
heed
and
it
will
suck
upon
thy
heart
the
sorcery
within
her
cry
till
madness
out
of
thee
upstart
and
rage
to
die
for
him
she
loved
she
laughed
to
death
and
as
afloat
his
chill
hand
lay
ha
ha
to
hell
i
sent
his
wraith
did
she
not
say
and
from
his
finger
strive
to
draw
the
ring
that
bound
him
to
her
spell
till
on
her
closed
his
hand
whose
awe
no
curse
could
quell
oh
yea
and
tho
she
struggled
pale
did
it
not
hold
her
cold
and
fast
till
crawled
the
tide
rock
and
swale
to
her
at
last
down
in
the
pool
where
she
was
swept
he
holds
her
oh
go
not
for
none
has
heard
her
cry
but
wept
and
died
that
year
human
love
we
spoke
of
god
and
fate
and
of
that
life
which
some
await
beyond
the
grave
it
will
be
fair
she
said
but
love
is
here
i
only
crave
thy
breast
not
god
when
i
am
dead
for
he
nor
wants
nor
needs
my
little
love
but
it
may
be
if
i
love
thee
and
those
whose
sorrow
daily
bleeds
he
knows
and
somehow
heeds
ashore
what
are
the
heaths
and
hills
to
me
i
for
the
sea
what
are
the
flowers
that
dapple
the
dell
and
the
ripple
of
over
the
dusk
what
are
the
church
and
the
folk
who
tell
their
hearts
to
god
my
heart
is
a
husk
i
for
the
sea
aye
for
there
is
no
peace
to
me
but
on
the
peaceless
sea
never
a
child
was
glad
at
my
knee
and
the
soul
of
a
woman
has
never
been
mine
what
can
a
woman
kisses
be
i
fear
to
think
how
her
arms
would
twine
i
for
the
sea
so
not
a
home
and
ease
for
me
but
still
the
homeless
sea
where
i
may
swing
my
sorrow
to
sleep
in
a
hammock
hung
the
voice
of
the
waves
where
i
may
wake
when
the
tempests
heap
and
hurl
their
hate
and
a
brave
ship
saves
i
for
the
sea
then
when
i
die
a
grave
for
me
but
in
the
graveless
sea
where
is
no
stone
for
an
eye
to
spell
thro
the
lichen
a
name
a
date
and
a
verse
let
me
be
laid
in
the
deeps
that
swell
and
sigh
and
wander
an
ocean
hearse
i
for
the
sea
the
victory
see
see
the
blows
at
his
breast
the
abyss
at
his
back
the
perils
and
pains
that
pressed
the
doubts
in
a
pack
that
hunted
to
drag
him
down
have
triumphed
and
now
he
sinks
who
climbed
for
the
crown
to
the
summit
brow
no
though
at
the
foot
he
lies
fallen
and
vain
with
gaze
to
the
peak
whose
skies
he
could
not
attain
the
victory
is
with
strength
no
matter
the
past
he
dare
it
again
the
dark
length
and
the
fall
at
last
at
winter
end
the
weedy
fallows
where
cattle
shiver
under
sodden
hay
the
long
and
lorn
the
fading
day
the
sullen
shudder
of
the
brook
and
winds
that
wring
the
writhen
trees
in
vain
for
drearier
sound
or
look
the
lonely
rain
the
crows
that
train
desert
skies
in
endless
caravans
that
have
no
goal
but
flight
where
darkness
flies
from
pole
to
pole
the
sombre
zone
of
hills
around
that
shrink
in
misty
mournfulness
from
sight
with
sunset
aureoles
crowned
before
the
night
the
seraphs
would
sing
to
her
and
from
the
river
dip
her
cool
grails
of
radiant
life
the
angels
would
bring
to
her
sadly
laurels
she
never
had
won
in
and
often
they
fly
with
her
the
silent
by
worlds
where
mortals
are
pent
yea
even
would
sigh
with
her
sigh
with
wan
faces
when
she
sat
weeping
of
strange
discontent
but
one
said
why
weepest
thou
here
in
god
heaven
is
it
not
fairer
than
soul
can
see
is
fair
ah
but
keepest
thou
not
me
depriven
of
some
one
somewhere
who
needeth
most
me
for
tho
the
day
never
fades
over
these
meadows
tho

of

dark
may
shroud
thee

beat
about
thee

come
to

window
you
who
are
mine
waken
the
night
is
calling
sit
by
me
here
with
the
moon
fair
shine
into
your
deep
eyes
falling
the
sea
afar
is
a
fearful
gloom
lean
from
the
casement
listen
anear
it
breaks
with
a
faery
spume
spraying
the
rocks
that
glisten
the
little
white
town
below
lies
deep
as
eternity
in
slumber
o
you
who
are
mine
how
a
glance
can
reap
beauties
beyond
all
number
and
how
as
sails
that
at
anchor
ride
our
spirits
rock
together
on
a
sea
of
love
lit
as
this
tide
with
tenderest
till
the
gray
dawn
is
up
over
the
moon
come
come
away
we
have
drunk
the
cup
ours
is
the
dream
undying
vii
on
the
pacific
a
storm
broods
far
on
the
foam
of
the
deep
the
gleams
before
a
day
and
a
night
a
night
and
a
day
and
the
way
love
will
be
six
thousand
wandering
miles
we
have
come
and
never
a
sail
have
seen
the
sky
above
and
the
sea
below
and
the
drifting
clouds
between
yet
in
our
hearts
unheaving
hope
and
light
and
joy
have
slept
nor
ever
lonely
has
seemed
the
wave
tho
heaving
wild
it
leapt
for
there
is
talismanic
might
within
our
vows
of
love
to
breathe
us
over
all
seas
of
life
on
to
that
port
above
where
the
great
captain
of
all
ships
shall
anchor
them
or
send
them
forth
on
a
vaster
voyage
yea
on
one
that
shall
not
end
and
upon
we
two
i
think
together
still
shall
sail
oh
may
it
be
my
own
or
may
we
perish
in
death
gale
the
atoner
winter
has
come
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
penance
for
summer
enverdured
sheaves
bitterly
cruelly
bleakly
he
lashes
his
limbs
that
are
naked
of
grass
and
leaves
he
moans
in
the
forest
for
sins
unforgiven
sins
of
the
revelous
days
of
june
moans
while
the
sun
drifts
dull
from
the
heaven
giftless
of
heat
beshriving
boon
long
must
he
mourn
and
long
be
his
scourging
long
will
the
aloof
frown
cold
long
will
earth
listen
the
rue
of
his
dirging
till
the
dark
beads
of
his
days
are
told
to
the
spring
wind
ah
what
a
changeling
yester
you
dashed
from
the
west
altho
it
is
spring
and
scattered
the
hail
with
maniac
zest
thro
the
shivering
corn
in
scorn
for
the
labour
of
god
and
man
and
now
from
the
plentiful
south
you
haste
with
lovingest
fingers
to
ruefully
lift
and
wooingly
fan
the
lily
that
lingers
on
the
stalk
as
if
the
chill
waste
of
the
earth
the
flowers
so
full
of
her
joy
were
not
as
it
seems
a
wanton
attempt
to
destroy
the
ramble
down
the
road
which
asters
tangle
thro
the
gap
where
twines
by
the
path
where
dry
leaves
dangle
sere
from
the
ivy
vines
we
go
by
sedgy
fallows
and
along
the
stifled
brook
till
it
stops
in
lushy
mallows
just
at
the
bridge
crook
then
again
fence
thro
thicket
to
the
mouth
of
the
rough
ravine
where
the
weird
cricket
chirrs
thro
the
weirder
green
there
a
way
rocks
but
quicker
is
the
beat
of
heart
and
foot
as
the
beams
above
us
flicker
sun
upon
moss
and
root
and
we
leap
as
wildness
tingles
from
the
air
into
our
blood
with
a
cry
thro
golden
dingles
hid
in
the
heart
of
the
wood
oh
the
wood
with
winds
with
the
nut
and
acorn
strown
oh
the
wood
where
creepers
trestle
tree
unto
tree
with
a
climb
the
ledging
summit
of
the
hill
is
reached
in
glee
for
an
hour
we
gaze
off
from
it
into
the
sky
blue
sea
but
a
bell
and
sunset
crimson
soon
recall
the
homeward
path
and
we
turn
as
the
glory
dims
on
the
mounded
math
thro
the
soft
and
silent
twilight
we
come
to
the
stile
at
last
as
the
clear
undying
eyelight
of
the
stars
tells
day
is
past
return
ah
it
was
here
september
and
silence
filled
the
air
i
came
last
year
to
remember
and
muse
hid
away
from
care
it
was
here
i
came
the
thistle
was
trusting
her
seed
to
the
wind
the
quail
in
the
croft
gave
whistle
as
now
and
the
fields
lay
thinned
i
know
how
the
hay
was
steeping
brown
mows
under
mellow
haze
how
a
frail
was
creeping
as
now
over
lone
just
there
where
the
catbird
calling
her
note
by
the
shed
the
wain
was
stalling
in
the
weedy
brook
dry
bed
and
the
cricket
lone
little
chimer
of
dreams
in
the
vines
chirred
on
like
a
doting
rhymer
of
his
firstling
lines
he
near
me
now
by
the
aster
beneath
whose
shadowy
spray
a
sultry
bee
seeps
faster
as
the
sun
slips
down
the
day
and
there
are
the
tall
primroses
like
maidens
waiting
to
dance
they
stood
in
the
same
shy
poses
last
year
as
if
to
entrance
the
stately
mulleins
to
waken
from
death
and
lead
them
around
and
still
they
will
stand
untaken
till
drops
their
gold
to
the
ground
yes
it
was
here
september
and
silence
round
me
yearned
again
i
come
to
remember
again
for
musing
returned
to
the
searing
fields
assuaging
and
the
falling
leaves
sad
balm
away
from
the
world
keen
waging
to
harvest
and
hills
and
calm
lisette
oh
there
was
love
in
her
heart
no
doubt
of
it
under
the
anger
but
see
what
came
out
of
it
not
a
knave
he
a
smitten
cloaking
in
languor
and
heartache
to
flatter
her
and
just
as
a
woman
will
even
the
best
of
them
she
yielded
brittle
god
spare
me
the
rest
of
them
for
though
but
kisses
she
swore
he
had
of
her
was
it
so
little
she
thought
was
not
bad
of
her
said
i
would
lavish
a
burning
on
any
grisette
and
silenced
me
powerful
but
she
was
mine
and
blood
is
inflammable
for
a
lisette
my
rage
was
undammable
could
a
stiletto
one
prick
be
prettier
look
at
the
gaping
no
then
you
her
pitier
pah
she
the
better
and
i
i
your
prisoner
loose
me
the
strapping
i
lay
one
more
kiss
on
her
from
one
blind
i
can
not
say
thy
cheek
is
like
the
rose
thy
hair
like
rippled
sunbeams
and
thine
eyes
like
violets
and
sprung
of
god
my
barren
gaze
can
never
know
what
throes
such
boons
of
beauty
waken
tho
i
rise
each
day
with
the
ruthless
hope
that
light
will
pierce
my
useless
lids
then
grope
till
night
blind
as
the
worm
within
his
clod
yet
unto
me
thou
art
not
less
divine
i
touch
thy
cheek
and
know
the
mystery
hid
within
the
twilight
breeze
i
smooth
thy
hair
and
understand
how
slipping
hours
may
twine
themselves
into
eternity
yea
rid
of
all
but
love
i
kiss
thine
eyes
and
seem
to
see
all
beauty
god
himself
may
dream
why
then
should
i
for
care
in
a
cemetery
when
autumn
melancholy
robes
the
land
with
silence
and
sad
fadings
mystical
of
other
years
move
thro
the
mellow
fields
i
turn
unto
this
meadow
of
the
dead
strewn
with
the
leaves
stormed
from
october
trees
and
wonder
if
my
resting
shall
be
dug
here
by
this
cedar
moan
or
under
the
sway
of
yonder
cypress
lair
of
winds
that
rove
as
valkyries
sent
from
valhalla
court
in
search
of
worthy
slain
and
sundry
times
with
questioning
i
tease
the
entombed
of
their
estate
seeking
to
know
whether
is
sweeter
in
the
grave
to
feel
the
oblivion
of
nature
silent
flow
or
here
to
wander
wistful
her
face
whether
the
harvesting
of
pain
and
joy
which
men
call
life
ends
so
or
whether
death
pours
the
warm
chrism
of
immortality
into
each
human
heart
whose
glow
is
spent
and
oft
the
silence
hears
me
for
a
voice
of
sighing
wind
may
answer
or
a
gaze
though
wordless
from
a
marble
seraph
face
or
sometimes
from
unspeakable
deeps
of
gold
that
ebb
along
the
west
revealings
wing
and
tremble
like
ethereal
swift
tongues
unskilled
of
human
speech
about
my
heart
till
youth
age
death
even
earth
all
it
seems
are
but
brave
moments
wakened
in
that
soul
to
whom
infinities
are
as
a
span
eternities
as
the
sun
and
worlds
as
sands
blown
from
sahara
wilds
into
the
ceaseless
surging
of
the
sea
then
twilight
hours
lead
back
my
wandered
spirit
from
out
the
wilderness
of
mystery
whence
none
may
find
a
path
to
the
unknown
and
chastened
to
content
i
turn
me
home
waking
oh
the
long
dawn
the
weary
endless
dawn
when
sleep
oblivion
is
torn
away
from
love
that
died
with
dying
yesterday
but
still
unburied
in
the
heart
lies
on
oh
the
sick
gray
the
twitter
in
the
trees
the
sense
of
human
waking
the
earth
the
quivering
memories
of
love
fair
birth
now
strown
as
deathless
flowers
its
decease
oh
the
regret
and
oh
regretlessness
striving
for
sovranty
within
the
soul
oh
fear
that
life
shall
never
more
be
whole
and
immortality
but
make
it
less
dusking
amber
dimly
creeps
over
the
vale
lit
by
the
kildee
silver
sweeps
sad
with
his
wail
eastward
swing
the
silent
clouds
into
the
night
burdens
of
day
they
seem
in
crowds
hurled
from
earth
sight
tilting
gulls
whip
whitely
far
over
the
lake
tirelessly
on
buoy
and
spar
till
they
shadow
and
mingled
mist
and
then
vanish
to
wing
still
the
bewildering
where
the
waves
ring
dusking
amber
dimly
dies
out
of
the
vale
dead
from
the
dunes
the
winds
arise
ghosts
of
the
gale
lingering
i
lingered
still
when
you
were
gone
when
tryst
and
trust
were
while
memory
like
a
wounded
swan
in
sorrow
sung
love
lore
i
lingered
till
the
whippoorwill
had
cried
delicious
pain
over
the
in
its
thrill
i
heard
your
voice
again
i
lingered
and
the
mellow
breeze
blew
to
me
sweetly
dewed
its
touch
awoke
the
sorceries
your
last
caresses
brewed
but
when
the
night
with
silent
start
had
sown
her
starry
seed
the
harvest
which
sprang
in
my
heart
was
loneliness
and
need
oh
who
is
he
will
follow
me
with
a
singing
down
sunny
roads
where
windy
odes
of
the
woods
are
ringing
where
leaves
are
tossed
from
branches
lost
in
a
tangle
of
vines
that
vie
to
clamber
high
but
to
vault
and
dangle
oh
who
is
he
his
eye
must
be
as
a
to
leap
and
woo
the
chicory
hue
in
the
his
hope
must
dance
like
radiance
that
hurries
to
scatter
shades
from
the
silent
glades
where
the
quick
hare
scurries
and
he
must
see
that
autumn
glee
and
her
laughter
from
his
lips
and
heart
will
quell
all
smart
of
before
and
after
the
lighthouseman
when
at
evening
smothered
lightnings
burn
the
clouds
with
fretted
fires
when
the
stars
forget
to
glisten
and
the
winds
refuse
to
listen
to
the
song
of
my
desires
oh
my
love
unto
thee
when
the
livid
breakers
angered
churn
against
my
stormy
tower
when
the
petrel
flying
faster
brings
an
omen
to
the
master
of
his
vessel
fated
hour
oh
the
reefs
ah
the
sea
then
i
climb
the
climbing
stairway
turn
the
light
across
the
storm
you
are
watching
for
the
laden
with
a
love
death
could
not
harm
lo
they
come
swift
and
free
that
means
i
think
of
thee
i
swear
me
thine
ah
hear
me
tho
you
sleep
is
that
i
know
thee
mine
thro
the
darkness
one
two
three
all
the
night
they
sweep
thro
raging
darkness
the
deep
one
and
two
and
three
serenity
and
could
i
love
it
more
this
simple
scene
of
hills
and
fields
that
lie
as
if
forgotten
were
all
green
so
bare
so
dead
or
could
my
gaze
more
tenderly
entwine
each
pallid
beech
and
silvery
sycamore
outreaching
arms
in
patience
to
divine
if
winter
ah
no
the
wind
has
blown
into
my
veins
the
blue
infinity
of
sky
the
sense
of
meadows
free
from
icy
pains
from
wintry
vents
and
sunny
peace
more
virgin
than
the
glow
falling
from
eve
first
star
into
the
night
brings
hope
believing
what
it
can
know
with
mortal
sight
wanton
june
i
knew
she
would
come
sarcastic
november
laughed
cold
and
glum
on
the
last
red
ember
of
forest
leaves
he
was
laughing
the
scorner
at
me
forlorner
than
any
that
grieves
because
i
asked
him
if
june
would
come
but
i
knew
she
would
come
when
winter
gripped
river
and
loam
and
the
wind
sped
flinter
on
icy
heel
i
was
chafing
my
sorrow
and
yearning
to
borrow
a
hope
that
would
steal
across
the
hours
till
june
should
come
and
now
she
is
here
the
wanton
i
follow
her
steps
ever
near
to
the
shade
of
the
hollow
where
violets
blow
and
chide
her
for
leaving
tho
half
believing
she
taunted
me
so
to
make
her
abided
return
more
dear
spirit
of
rain
miyanoshita
japan
spirit
of
rain
with
all
thy
mountain
mists
that
wander
lonely
as
a
gray
train
of
souls
newly
discarnate
seeking
new
life
only
spirit
of
rain
leading
them
thro
dim
torii
up
onward
till
not
in
vain
they
tremble
upon
the
peaks
and
plunge
rejoicing
dawnward
spirit
of
rain
so
would
i
lead
my
dead
thoughts
high
and
higher
till
they
regain
birth
and
the
beauty
of
a
new
life
fire
autumn
at
the
bridge
brown
dropping
of
leaves
soft
rush
of
the
wind
slow
searing
of
sheaves
on
the
hill
green
plunging
of
frogs
cool
lisp
of
the
brook
far
barking
of
dogs
at
the
mill
hot
hanging
of
clouds
high
poise
of
the
hawk
flush
laughter
of
crowds
from
the
ridge
oh
sadness
gladness
madness
of
an
autumn
day
at
the
bridge
tearless
do
women
weep
when
men
have
died
it
can
not
be
for
i
have
sat
here
by
his
side
breathing
dear
names
against
his
face
that
he
must
list
to
were
his
place
over
god
throne
yet
have
i
wept
no
tear
and
made
no
moan
do
women
weep
not
gaze
grief
seems
in
vain
do
women
weep
i
was
his
bride
they
brought
him
to
me
cold
and
pale
upon
his
lids
i
saw
the
trail
of
deathly
pain
they
said
her
tears
will
fall
like
autumn
rain
i
can
not
weep
not
if
hot
tears
dropped
on
his
lids
might
burn
him
back
to
life
and
years
of
yearning
love
would
any
rise
to
flood
the
anguish
from
my
eyes
and
i
his
bride
ah
me
do
women
weep
when
men
have
died
upon
how
many
a
hill
across
how
many
a
field
beside
how
many
a
river
restful
flowing
they
stand
with
eyes
and
hearts
of
healed
gazing
o
wistful
sun
upon
thy
going
they
have
forgotten
life
forgotten
sunless
death
desire
is
gone
is
it
not
gone
for
ever
no
memory
of
strife
have
they
or
breath
no
hopes
to
fear
or
fears
hope
can
not
sever
silent
the
gold
steals
down
the
west
and
mystery
moves
deeper
in
their
hearts
and
settles
darker
is
faded
the
day
crown
but
strange
and
shadowy
they
see
the
unseen
as
night
falls
stark
and
starker
like
priests
whose
altar
fires
are
spent
immovable
they
stand
in
awful
ecstasy
uplifted
zephyrs
awake
the
starry
deeps
are
full
earth
with
a
mystic
majesty
is
gifted
ah
though
time
were
but
pulsing
pain
and
death
no
more
than
its
eternal
ceasing
would
you
not
choose
the
throe
hold
the
oblivion
vain
to
have
beheld
so
many
a
day
releasing
the
empty
cross
the
eve
of
golgotha
had
come
and
christ
lay
shrouded
in
the
garden
tomb
among
the
olives
oh
how
dumb
how
sad
the
sun
incarnadined
the
gloom
the
hill
grew
dim
the
pleading
cross
reached
empty
arms
toward
the
closing
gate
jerusalem
oh
count
thy
loss
oh
hear
ye
hear
ye
ere
it
be
too
late
reached
bleeding
arms
but
how
in
vain
the
murmurous
multitude
within
the
wall
already
had
forgot
his
pain
would
forget
the
cross
and
all
they
knew
not
rome
before
its
sign
bending
her
brow
bound
with
the
nations
threne
would
sweep
all
lands
from
nile
to
rhine
in
servitude
unto
the
nazarene
nor
knew
that
millions
would
forsake
ancestral
shrines
great
with
the
glow
of
time
and
lifting
up
its
token
shake
aeons
with
thrill
of
love
or
battle
crime
with
empty
arms
aloft
it
stood
ah
scribe
and
pharisee
ye
builded
well
the
cross
emblotted
with
his
blood
mounts
highest
hope
of
men
against
earth
hell
unburthened
not
grief
nor
the
sunny
wine
of
gladness
steeps
my
spirit
as
i
gaze
over
these
meads
that
lie
engarmented
in
stubble
robes
of
brown
for
as
those
solitary
trees
afar
have
reached
unbudding
boughs
to
the
dim
day
and
melted
on
the
infinite
calm
of
space
so
have
i
reached
and
am
no
more
distraught
with
the
quivering
pangs
of
memory
yesterday
but
the
boon
of
blue
skies
deeper
than
despair
of
rest
that
rises
as
a
tide
of
sleep
of
care
borne
on
the
plumes
of
clouds
away
to
the
sullen
shades
of
the
low
west
have
lulled
my
soul
with
soft
infinitude
and
lent
it
faith
illimitable
peace
song
her
voice
is
vibrant
beauty
dipt
in
dreams
of
infinite
sorrow
and
delight
thro
an
awaiting
soul
is
slipt
and
lo
words
spring
that
breathe
immortal
to
her
who
shall
come
out
of
the
night
of
lovelessness
i
call
thee
as
in
a
chill
chamber
where
no
rays
of
unbelievable
light
and
freedom
fall
might
cry
one
manacled
and
tho
the
ways
come
i
can
not
see
tho
my
heart
sore
with
emptiness
when
morning
silent
grays
wake
me
to
long
aloneness
yet
i
know
thou
hast
been
with
me
who
like
dawn
wilt
go
beside
me
when
i
have
found
thee
evermore
so
in
the
garden
of
my
heart
each
day
i
plant
thee
a
flower
now
the
pansy
peace
and
now
the
lily
faith
or
now
a
spray
of
the
climbing
ivy
hope
and
they
cease
around
the
still
unblossoming
rose
of
love
to
bend
in
fragrant
tribute
to
her
sway
then
for
thy
shelter
from
life
sultrier
suns
the
oak
of
strength
i
set
joy
that
runs
with
brooklet
glee
from
winds
that
grieve
above
but
where
now
art
thou
watching
with
love
eye
the
wander
listening
through
dim
trees
some
thrilled
muezzin
of
the
forest
cry
from
his
leafy
minaret
or
by
the
blue
brim
while
the
spectral
moon
half
it
hangs
like
the
faery
isle
of
avalon
do
these
my
yearnings
speak
to
thee
of
days
thy
feet
have
never
trod
sweet
sweet
oh
more
than
sweet
my
own
must
be
our
meeting
mystic
pangs
and
will
be
soon
for
last
night
near
dreaming
god
called
me
thro
the
sphere
of
heaven
and
said
come
waiting
one
and
lay
thine
ear
unto
my
heart
there
thou
shalt
hear
the
secrets
of
this
world
where
evils
war
such
things
i
heard
as
must
rend
mortal
clay
to
tell
and
trembled
till
god
pitying
said
listen
oh
my
love
i
heard
thee
sing
out
of
thy
window
to
the
morning
star
tossing
swirling
swept
by
the
wind
beaten
abaft
by
the
rain
the
swallows
high
in
the
sodden
sky
circle
oft
and
again
they
rise
and
sink
and
drift
and
swing
twitterless
in
the
chill
for
stark
is
the
coming
dark
over
the
wet
of
the
hill
wildly
swiftly
at
last
they
stream
into
their
chimney
home
a
livid
gash
in
the
west
a
crash
then
silence
sadness
gloam
slaves
a
host
of
bloody
centuries
lie
prone
upon
the
fields
of
time
but
still
the
wake
of
progress
loud
is
haunted
with
the
groan
of
myriads
from
whose
peaceful
veins
to
slake
his
scarlet
thirst
has
war
fierce
polypheme
of
fate
insatiately
drunk
life
stream
we
bid
the
courier
lightning
leap
along
its
instant
path
with
spirit
speed
command
stars
lost
in
to
throng
before
the
magnet
eye
of
science
stand
on
glory
peak
and
triumphingly
cry
out
mastery
of
earth
and
sea
and
air
but
unto
war
necessity
we
bare
our
piteous
breasts
and
impotently
die
avowal
to
the
nightingale
tho
thou
hast
unpent
thy
pain
delight
upon
these
airs
bird
of
the
poet
love
yet
must
i
sing
thy
singing
for
the
night
has
poured
her
jewels
the
lap
of
heaven
as
they
who
hear
thee
say
thou
dost
above
the
wood
such
ecstasies
as
were
not
given
by
nestling
breasts
of
venus
to
the
dove
oft
have
i
watched
the
moon
with
her
fair
gold
still
clung
to
by
the
tattered
mists
of
day
arise
and
look
for
thee
then
hope
grew
bold
and
almost
i
could
see
how
the
near
laurels
would
tremble
with
thy
trembling
but
the
sway
of
bards
who
wreathed
thee
with
unfading
chorals
has
held
my
longing
lips
from
this
poor
lay
but
take
it
now
and
if
the
lark
who
is
too
high
for
earth
may
vie
for
praise
with
thee
in
aery
rhapsody
yet
it
is
his
to
sing
of
day
and
joy
while
thou
of
sorrow
and
night
singest
so
be
more
dear
than
he
till
hearts
shall
cease
to
borrow
from
grief
the
healing
for
life
mystery
wildness
to
drift
with
the
drifting
clouds
and
blow
with
the
blow
of
breezes
to
ripple
with
waves
and
murmur
with
caves
to
soar
as
the
pleases
to
dip
with
the
dipping
sails
and
burn
with
the
burning
heaven
my
life
my
soul
for
the
infinite
roll
of
a
day
to
wildness
given
before
autumn
summer
last
moon
has
waned
waned
as
amber
fires
of
an
aztec
shrine
the
invisible
breath
of
coming
death
has
stained
the
withering
leaves
with
its
nepenthean
wine
autumn
near
winds
in
the
woodland
moan
moan
as
memories
of
a
chilling
yore
magnolia
seeds
like
indian
beads
are
strown
from
crimson
pods
along
the
earth
sere
floor
autumn
near
solitude
slowly
steals
steals
her
silent
way
by
the
songless
brook
at
the
gnarly
yoke
of
a
solemn
oak
she
kneels
the
musing
joy
of
sadness
in
her
look
autumn
near
yes
with
her
golden
days
days
when
hope
and
toil
are
at
peace
and
rest
autumn
is
near
and
the
tired
year
praise
lies
down
with
leaf
and
blossom
on
his
breast
autumn
near
fulfilment
in
the
mellow
beauty
of
the
ripening
sun
sad
with
the
lingering
sense
of
summer
purpose
done
the
shorn
and
searing
fields
stretch
from
me
one
by
one
along
the
creek
the
drop
their
shadows
down
the
fallow
hill
wearing
autumnal
warmth
the
farm
sleeps
by
the
mill
around
each
heavy
eave
low
smoke
hangs
blue
and
still
life
flow
is
weak
along
the
weedy
roads
and
lanes
i
walk
or
pause
ponder
a
fallen
nut
or
quirking
crow
whose
caws
seem
with
prehuman
hintings
fraught
or
ancient
awes
of
forest
deeps
of
forest
deeps
the
hunter
never
trod
nor
indian
with
the
silent
stealth
of
nature
shod
deeps
tense
with
the
timelessness
and
solitude
of
god
who
never
sleeps
and
many
times
has
autumn
on
her
harvest
way
gathered
again
into
the
earth
leaf
fruit
and
spray
here
many
times
dwelt
rueful
as
she
dwells
the
while
she
reaps
last
sight
of
land
the
clouds
in
woe
hang
far
and
dim
i
look
again
and
lo
only
a
faint
and
shadow
line
of
shore
i
watch
it
go
the
gulls
have
left
the
ship
and
wheel
back
to
the
cliff
gray
wraith
will
it
be
so
of
all
our
thoughts
when
we
set
sail
on
death
and
what
will
the
last
sight
be
of
life
as
lone
we
fare
and
fast
grief
and
the
face
we
love
in
mist
then
night
and
awe
too
vast
or
the
dear
light
of
hope
like
that
oh
see
from
the
lost
shore
kindling
and
calling
onward
you
shall
reach
the
evermore
silence
silence
is
song
unheard
is
beauty
never
born
is
light
forgotten
left
unstirred
upon
creation
morn
the
end
