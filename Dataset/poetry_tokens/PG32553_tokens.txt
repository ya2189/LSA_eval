they
hang
upon
we
can
not
ever

on
christmas
eve
the
angels
stand
about
it
after
tea
and
if
an
angel
very
good
he
gets
a
present
as
he
should
as
you
would
be
done
by
of
course
i
believe
in
fairies
of
course
i
know
they
true
just
think
if
you
were
a
fairy
and
no
one
believed
in
you
drawing
upon
my
slate
i
draw
strange
things
i
never
saw
nor
you
nor
any
one
but
oh
it
is
such
fun
the
a
a
curious
thing
it
made
of
just
a
stick
and
string
a
boy
at

end
and
a
wish
and
on
the
other
end
a
fish

you
ever

were
a

maybe
soon

the

a
white
cherry

oh
cherry
that
lies
on
the
shelf
when
i
have
a
penny
i
buy
you
myself
the
independent
kite
a
kite
is
very
nice
to
own
it
never
never
grieves
you
when
it
wants
to
play
alone
and
just
goes
off
and
leaves
you
practicing
the
black
notes
are
the
bridegrooms
the
white
notes
are
the
brides
and
i
why
i
the
minister
and
all
the
guests
besides
fairyland
secret
service
a
snowflake
is
a
letter
a
fairy
in
the
sky
is
sending
to
the
fairies
here
and
when
they
read
its
message
clear
lest
any
one
should
spy
they
purse
their
little
lips
and
blow
to
melt
that
note
of
snow
oh
let
us
see
if
we
can
snatch
and
read
a
fairyland
dispatch
a
book
a
book
a
magic
sort
of
thing
that
makes
you
sailor
chief
or
king
when
i
am
old
and
own
a
shelf
i
think
i
have
a
book
myself
the
lonesome
sea
the
sea
is
so
lonely
now
winter
is
here
i
wish
we
could
only
go
down
to
the
pier
and
say
to
him
kindly
do
think
sea
we
forgotten
you
quite
for
we
have
not
we
last
summer
we
scurried
all
sudden
i
know
from
the
beach
do
be
worried
we
hated
to
go
i
should
like
to
go
clear
to
the
end
of
the
pier
for
he
lonesome
and
tell
him
we
coming
next
year
the
mountains
the
mountains
do
not
stir
or
show
emotion
when
spring
comes
i
know
but
though
they
are
restrained
by
pride
i
think
that
they
are
glad
inside
when
dolly
is
afraid
when
lights
are
standing
in
the
street
and
on
the
sidewalk
all
the
feet
are
quiet
and
it
growing
late
and
our
brown
clock
is
striking
eight
i
pack
the
animals
and
ark
and
push
them
deep
into
the
dark
and
in
a
quiet
row
i
lay
my
cups
and
saucers
the
day
but
who
could
ever
say
and
leave
her
doll
in
such
a
plight
i
could
let
her
stay
without
a
friend
and
hear
the
dark
about
so
she
and
i
go
straight
upstairs
she
shuts
her
eyes
while
we
say
prayers
and
then
we
lie
and
count
up
sheep
until
we
both
are
fast
asleep
it
not
because
i
dread
at
all
the
darkness
that
i
keep
my
doll
but
just
because
i
think
that
she
would
be
frightened
without
the
little
trees
that
to
the
breeze
make
quaint
and
timorous
courtesies
i
like
to
come
and
play
with
these
each
pine
that
stands
in
line
is
but
a
stranger
great
and
fine
the
trees
are
friends
of
mine
the
cockatoo
green
and
yellow
cockatoo
wo
you
let
me
talk
to
you
or
if
you
would
kinder
be
wo
you
come
and
talk
to
me
tell
me
all
about
the
places
where
the
children
have
black
faces
armlets
anklets
copper
rings
where
the
cannibals
are
kings
has
a
hungry
crocodile
ever
met
you
with
a
smile
have
you
taken
many
a
trip
in
a
rakish
pirate
ship
cockatoo
cockatoo
how
i
like
to
talk
to
you
but
as
you
can
guess
i
be
gladder
if
you
talk
to
me
high
cost
of
living
among
the
angels
it
a
shame
to
tell
it
prices
are
so
dear
they
use
the
to
mend
the
ragged
stars
this
year
need
i
like
the
kitten
of
my
friends
i
like
its
claws
caught
in
my
lace
i
like
the
way
each
small
ear
ends
i
like
the
black
upon
its
face
i
feel
its
heart
beat
in
my
hand
and
then
i
somehow
understand
so
many
things
i
did
know
i
kinder
and
my
voice
is
low
and
i
close
doors
more
softly
too
and
do
the
things
i
told
to
do
instead
of
wishing
they
were
done
but
mother
says
we
may
have
one
i
want
a
kitten
all
my
own
to
play
with
when
i
left
alone
and
when
the
family
gone
away
to
shop
and
work
and
call
and
play
tennis
and
other
things
it
all
so
queer
and
lonely
in
the
hall
and
in
the
parlor
too
and
in
the
where
words
have
been
but
are
not
now
the
chairs
and
i
wait
through
the
hours
till
our
only
playmates
little
fears
there
room
in
all
our
lives
i
think
for
one
small
kitten
black
as
ink
with
two
white
spots
behind
its
ears
illustration
i
like
the
kitten
of
my
friends
blue
skies
are
very
apt
to
fade
dark
colors
wear
the
best
it
true
but
who
would
choose
a
useful
shade
i
want
mine
blue
left
out
if
shoemakers
children
are
left
with
feet
bare
i
wondered
and
wondered
i
do
think
it
fair
if
maybe
at
christmas
there
are
any
toys
left
over
for
santa
claus
own
girls
and
boys
the
white
birch
a
white
birch
grows
in
the
deepest
wood
if
you
are
good
and
the
stars
are
right
who
knows
you
may
see
some
night
the
nymphs
stand
under
the
heave
of
its
boughs
in
a
row
but
if
you
wonder
they
will
fade
and
go
you
must
just
believe
the
playmate
last
year
i
played
with
the
country
this
year
with
the
sea
now
the
queer
old
city
stops
and
plays
with
stops
in
its
counting
of
pennies
it
never
never
fails
to
know
the
time
i
going
to
bed
and
tells
me
fairy
tales
thanksgiving
the
turkey
is
a
mournful
bird
from
all
that
i
have
ever
heard
if
he
could
live
this
day
to
see
how
very
thankful
he
would
be
the
nest
that
tree
has
a
nest
and
if
i
lie
quite
still
and
if
i
have
luck
i
may
see
two
heads
or
three
stretched
out
hark
hark
wings
sound
and
a
dark
shadow
comes
flying
through
boughs
they
are
trying
to
reach
the
food
that
the
large
bird
brings
unfinished
wings
are
such
curious
things
they
are
almost
old
enough
to
fly
the
three
if
they
knew
as
i
do
and
you
that
nests
are
cozier
than
the
sky
illustration
unfinished
wings
are
such
curious
things
the
orange
the
sky
is
a
greedy
child
who
holds
one
yellow
orange
in
her
hand
it
is
the
sun
she
holds
it
primly
then
hid
from
sight
all
in
the
darkness
eats
it
at
night
i
almost
got
to
fairyland
one
day
i
almost
got
to
fairyland
one
day
i
walked
out
straight
along
the
so
and
there
were
little
hummings
in
the
world
and
moving
things
went
through
the
grass
and
all
the
air
was
just
as
glad
as
if
there
were
a
party
somewhere
at
a
fairy
house
i
knew
they
had
a
party
and
i
knew
that
they
had
kept
a
seat
for
me
if
i
could
only
find
the
right
turn
in
the
road
i
was
so
near
to
fairyland
so
near
that
i
could
almost
hear
the
fairy
gates
swing
open
for
me
waiting
just
for
me
i
was
so
near
to
fairyland
and
then
just
then
i
heard
my
mother
calling
me
come
in
to
supper
dear
i
heard
her
call
and
so
i
never
got
to
fairyland
i
know
that
there
are
fairies
though
because
i
almost
got
to
fairyland
one
day
untrained
trains
a
train
should
never
jump
the
track
such
rude
behavior
shows
a
lack
of
poise
it
really
a
disgrace
a
train
should
know
its
proper
place
handicapped
i
run
as
fast
as
i
can
go
when
trains
run
past
our
place
they
bigger
far
than
i
and
so
they
always
win
the
race
a
sunset
life
seems
so
sweet
i
do
know
why
perhaps
is
just
because
the
sky
put
on
to
make
me
glad
a
dress
i
did
know
she
had
to
ships
tall
ships
tall
ships
sailing
out
to
sea
have
you
in
your
dreaming
hearts
any
room
for
me
for
a
little
singing
maid
who
would
sail
with
you
out
to
where
the
ocean
miles
are
blue
blue
blue
tall
ships
tall
ships
loosening
from
shore
steering
all
by
and
sailing
evermore
take
a
little
wishful
maid
with
you
as
you
go
i
would
feel
the
ocean
tempests
blow
blow
blow
tall
ships
tall
ships
see
i
stretch
my
hands
pray
you
take
me
with
you
to
far
and
foreign
lands
ships
an
eager
little
maid
prays
that
she
may
be
sailing
as
you
sail
forever
free
free
free
the
sea
is
like
a
garden
green
the
spray
like
daisies
white
and
one
full
rose
alone
is
seen
the
great
red
sun
at
night
in
their
loveliness
the
ships
against
the
skies
are
just
as
any
one
can
guess
the
garden
butterflies
buds
the
buds
have
come
to
town
demure
and
brown
their
coats
and
under
see
how
can
such
fragile
fairy
colors
be
the
buds
have
come
to
us
all
tremulous
we
quite
as
glad
as
they
take
off
your
cloaks
dear
little
buds
and
stay
the
flower
cart
the
flower
cart
coming
down
the
street
with
tulips
red
and
tulips
sweet
and
from
the
wagon
color
spills
of
hyacinths
and
daffodils
and
purple
rhododendrons
grow
beside
the
roses
in
a
row
oh
let
us
hasten
down
to
spend
before
the
flower
cart
rounds
the
bend
oh
let
us
bring
our
pennies
and
hold
all
of
spring
within
our
hand
eavesdroppers
the
stars
lean
down
and
listen
at
time
they
twinkle
and
they
glisten
to
hear
each
happy
rhyme
to
all
our
cheerful
singing
the
little
stars
beat
time
the
stars
lean
down
and
hear
us
they
know
it
not
polite
but
then
they
cease
to
fear
us
about
this
time
of
night
they
creep
and
edge
up
near
us
although
it
is
right
eavesdroppers
but
we
love
them
we
leave
a
little
space
and
never
crowd
or
shove
them
because
in
any
case
that
stretch
of
blue
above
them
is
such
a
lonely
place
singing
secrets
bird
up
in
the
tossing
down
to
me
broken
songs
to
where
i
sit
underneath
the
tree
bird
up
in
the
what
is
it
you
hear
that
you
try
to
say
again
in
your
singing
clear
what
is
it
you
see
up
there
in
the
green
and
blue
does
the
world
look
very
strange
strange
and
fair
to
you
do
you
see
some
happy
thing
that
you
try
to
show
in
the
eager
chirps
you
toss
gayly
down
below
you
are
singing
secrets
bird
i
am
very
sure
i
can
understand
no
word
but
oh
try
once
more
bird
up
in
the
sing
again
to
me
maybe
i
can
hear
it
now
maybe
i
can
see
the
day
before
april
no
little
brown
bird
go
away
i
have
no
time
to
dream
i
must
do
certain
things
you
see
i
know
not
why
but
it
must
be
here
i
must
study
foolish
books
and
not
guess
how
the
lilac
looks
hush
little
bird
and
do
not
sing
i
have
no
time
to
play
with
spring
the
corn
the
corn
like
soldiers
in
a
row
we
stop
and
cheer
them
let
the
tassels
are
their
waving
flags
the
leaves
their
bayonets
they
march
to
meet
king
frost
their
foe
the
fight
will
soon
begin
king
frost
will
conquer
them
i
know
but
oh
if
they
win
if
a
star
if
a
star
were
to
say
i
will
stay
and

would
have
you
cry
princes
cinderella
sitting
in
her
dingy
chimney
corner
delving
in
the
ashes
with
the
smoke
upon
her
eyes
with
pots
and
kettles
waiting
all
her
kinfolk
by
to
scorn
her
longed
perhaps
to
meet
a
prince
handsome
young
and
wise
maybe
sleeping
beauty
on
her
couch
within
the
castle
while
her
golden
hair
crept
down
to
touch
her
silent
feet
dreamed
about
a
rider
with
a
scarlet
cap
and
tassel
who
would
hack
away
the
hedge
and
cry
awaken
sweet
while
i
washing
dishes
or
scraping
out
the
skillet
or
when
i
am
sprinkling
or
folding
up
the
clothes
sometimes
i
too
dream
it
seems
to
tell
it
but
their
princes
came
at
last
and
ah
who
knows
illustration
while
i
washing
dishes
or
scraping
out
the
skillet
our
share
babies
of
alaska
babies
of
japan
babies
born
to
beads
or
silk
or
fez
or
fur
or
fan
none
of
all
the
babies
that
are
toddling
anywhere
is
half
so
sweet
a
baby
as
the
baby
that
our
share
if
i
were
santa
little
boy
if
i
were
santa
little
boy
if
there
a
family
of
santa
clauses
in
the
sky
or
where
their
home
may
be
if
i
were
santa
oldest
son
i
only
hope
that
he
one
and
my
papa
should
say
to
me
what
christmas
present
son
would
be
the
very
thing
you
like
to
see
within
your
stocking
christmas
day
i
would
stop
to
think
would
you
but
say
i
want
to
drive
the
sleigh
and
then
when
christmas
week
had
come
at
nearly
dawn
on
christmas
day
i
load
the
sleigh
with
doll
and
drum
and
find
where
the
reindeer
were
tied
and
hitch
them
quickly
up
and
shout
very
loudly
clear
the
way
and
crack
the
whip
and
drive
the
sleigh
down
from
the
pole
and
past
the
clang
of
loud
icicles
in
a
row
blown
by
the
wind
to
where
the
gang
lives
in
our
street
and
then
i
shout
while
frightened
heads
of
boys
stuck
out
from
opened
windows
in
surprise
with
tousled
hair
and
sleepy
eyes
i
shout
out
loudly
so
that
they
could
hear
each
single
word
i
say
hey
dasher
dancer
faster
prancer
run
as
hard
now
as
you
can
sir
stop
your
balking
when
i
talking
we
must
fill
each
christmas
stocking
in
a
hundred
million
places
dasher
dancer
mind
your
paces
do
you
dare
to
break
the
traces
then
i
shake
the
reins
and
shout
to
milkmen
that
might
be
about
clear
the
way
for
santa
sleigh
because
i
driving
it
the
party
dress
all
year
long
the
timid
maple
has
been
dressed
in
prim
and
sober
little
plain
utilitarian
gowns
of
quiet
tints
of
green
but
spring
is
gone
and
summer
past
and
now
that
it
october
the
modest
little
maple
tree
is
costumed
like
a
queen
just
look
now
through
our
window
and
i
sure
that
you
agree
that
her
party
dress
is
pretty
as
a
party
dress
can
be
the
clock
that
autumn
winds
school
is
like
a
clock
that
stops
in
vacation
time
tick
tock
tick
tock
a
rhyme
every
school
day
is
a
minute
this
clock
has
long
minutes
in
it
in
vacation
time
it
stops
not
a
sound
at
all
not
a
tick
not
a
tock
hanging
on
the
wall
waits
the
clock
until
fall
finds
it
stands
upon
a
chair
and
winds
it
conversation
in
proper
sentences
of
purr
and
monosyllables
of
mews
when
i
have
told
my
news
to
her
my
kitten
tells
me
kitten
news
the
homesick
star
the
candle
stood
beside
my
bed
and
dropped
a
little
tear
i
sat
up
shivering
and
said
i
know
you
lonesome
here
you
rather
have
the
sky
than
me
you
been
too
kind
by
far
to
say
so
now
i
guessed
you
see
that
you
a
homesick
star
i
send
you
home
again
for
i
was
homesick
once
and
know
and
when
you
safely
in
the
sky
and
i
am
here
below
then
do
forget
me
candle
please
but
twinkle
very
plain
on
dark
dark
nights
about
like
these
above
my
window
pane
then
though
i
am
afraid
at
night
that
thieves
might
be
about
i
screwed
my
eyes
up
very
tight
and
blew
the
candle
out
the
lonesomest
fairy
there
a
dewdrop
shining
bright
on
the
grass
by
the
sun
undried
it
a
tear
that
fell
in
the
night
when
the
lonesomest
fairy
cried
the
present
the
sky
is
like
a
christmas
tree
the
burning
stars
its
candles
be
the
moon
a
bulky
gift
and
odd
marked
to
the
world
with
love
from
god
grief
forget
it
soon
it
i
know
that
i
forget
i
crying
so
the
saturdays
party
in
fairyland
all
the
saturdays
met
one
day
each
was
very
polite
they
say
they
shook
each
other
by
the
hand
and
had
a
party
in
fairyland
they
would
let
any
monday
in
and
not
one
tuesday
at
all
could
win
her
way
past
the
supercilious
crowd
and
wednesdays
why
they
were
allowed
thursdays
could
only
stand
in
the
street
and
look
through
the
door
at
the
things
to
eat
and
the
fridays
and
sundays
pretended
they
did
like
parties
anyway
but
the
saturdays
had
the
greatest
fun
they
played
and
and
and
and
everything
else
they
wanted
to
play
they
used
the
throne
for
musical
chairs
as
if
the
fairy
queen
house
were
theirs
in
rooms
enchanted
they
ran
and
hid
and
whatever
they
wished
they
could
do
they
did
and
after
they
played
and
played
and
played
they
had
pink
straws
in
their
lemonade
and
the
cookies
and
tarts
were
like
a
dream
and
all
the
saturdays
had
i
my
doubts
when
i
heard
and
you
have
yours
but
strange
things
happen
on
foreign
shores
and
they
say
that
the
best
fête
ever
planned
was
the
saturdays
party
in
fairyland
the
sorrows
of
a
seamstress
i
learning
to
sew
i
basting
and
hemming
and
all
that
but
i
wish
that
the
eye
were
bigger
or
the
thread
not
quite
so
fat
my
mother
garden
is
the
sea
my
mother
garden
is
the
sea
if
it
is
viewed
aright
the
sweet
alyssum
borders
are
the
ocean
breakers
white
the
butterflies
and
are
flying
and
in
our
gravel
garden
path
i
pace
a
foreign
shore
the
gymnastic
clock
the
little
clock
is
friends
with
me
it
talks
as
plain
as
plain
can
be
and
says
each
morning
as
it
rises
now
do
forget
your
exercises
both
hands
above
your
head
you
know
then
lower
them
very
slowly
so
ho
do
get
tired
and
stop
that
way
exercise
like
this
all
day
right
in
its
face
then
i
say
pooh
i
would
boast
of
it
like
you
but
i
can
swing
my
arms
too
and
so
the
clock
then
looks
at
me
and
i
look
back
and
i
and
he
each
single
morning
when
we
rise
just
exercise
and
exercise

our
playhouse
is
so
near
to
fairyland
our
playhouse
is
so
near
to
fairyland
i
think
the
fairies
come
and
peep
to
see
how
children
play
so
sometimes
when
there
something
in
the
grass
that
sounds
like
fairies
footsteps
very
faint
not
far
away
we
sit
quite
still
all
on
the
playhouse
wall
but
though
we
wait
and
wait
for
them
to
speak
they
never
do
our
playhouse
is
so
near
to
fairyland
they
come
some
day
and
start
to
play
with
us
i
think
do
you
new

does
do
you
any
good
to
hide
trees
everybody
knows
you
there
inside
besides
although
you
think
you
hid
complete
we
see
your
feet
beach
birds

birds
flying
in
to
me
from
the
wide
blue
palaces
of
your
home

what
have
you
to
tell
about
islands
green
and
fair
stories
of
the
ships
that
tramp
the
trail
to
everywhere
have
you
seen
a
sailor
lad
dreaming
at
the
wheel
have
you
seen
the
great
sharks
flash
white
beneath
a
keel
have
you
seen
the
savages
dancing
in
a
ring
have
you
on
a

me
in
some
far
blue
of
your

you
tell
the
listening
birds
how
in
a
curious
land
once
you
saw
a
little
maid
playing
in
the
sand
the
sky
song
the
sky
stands
up
to
sing
before
us
each
star
a
word
the
moon
the
chorus
a
spring
thought
the
new
birds
tweet
and
buds
come
sweet
and
puffy
clouds
are
in
the
sky
the
world
is
full
of
little
girls
but
very
few
as
nice
as
i
the
zoo
we
were
walking
in
the
zoo
and
all
the
animals
looked
at
us
the
bear
and
the
hippopotamus
and
quite
a
few
lions
and
wolves
and
a
yak
and
a
gnu
and
we
were
glad
some
one
had
made
cages
around
them
so
that
we
could
walk
there
and
not
be
afraid
but
could
just
pretend
that
they
were
free
and
could
eat
us
both
if
they
wanted
to
six
in
june
the
leaves
are
born
the

in

cloud
magic
beneath
the
comfortable
sky
all
afternoon
i
love
to
lie
and
think
about
the
books
i
read
and
all
the
things
i
dream
in
bed
when
i
am
not
quite
sleeping
yet
the
things
that
day
makes
me
forget
the
white
clouds
looked
like
ships
one
day
and
then
like
lambkins
strayed
away
and
as
i
look
i
understand
just
where
it
is
that
fairyland
it
only
lying
down
you
know
the
clouds
make
pictures
for
me
so
when
i
stand
up
to
see
them
why
there
nothing
there
but
clouds
and
sky
ambition
a
lonely
little
desert
isle
that
was
not
comforted
by
all
the
oceans
mile
on
mile
sighed
wistfully
and
said
it
hard
sometimes
to
be
content
i
wish
i
were
a
continent
tree
birthdays
look
look
at
me
my
birthday
tree

let
me
stand
up
so
beside
you
how
you

i
tall
but
oh
i
never
be
as
tall
as
you
i
know
tree
when
your
birthday

why
do
you

seem
so
small
and
you
so
tall

a
birthday
every
week
in
autumn
i
sorry

leaves

gone
and
left
you
but

and
cool
i
have
to
go
to
school

should
mind
i
wish
that
i
were

why
you

aristocracy
and
i
a

the
day
from

moons
are
large
and
white
mountain
moons
are
round
i
have
seen
the
moons
at
night
growing
from
the
ground
and
i
like
the
seaside
moons
in
the
sky
but
in
town
the
moons
are
all
so
far
and
high
the
discovery
it
often
rains
in
our
town
and
you
know
it
always
happens
when
we
planned
to
go
on
walks
or
hikes
or
somewhere
out
to
play
it
curious
how
it
seems
arranged
that
way
we
used
to
use
those
rainy
days
to
pout
and
stand
there
at
the
window
looking
out
and
wishing
things
about
the
weather
oh
i
never
knew
a
wish
to
change
it
though
but
now
the
gladdest
secret
we
do
need
our
dad
to
tell
us
stories
we
can
read
we
found
that
fairyland
is
everywhere
you
open
up
a
book
and
why
you
there
gardening
is
heaps
of
fun
gardening
is
heaps
of
fun
we
are
partners
with
the
sun
for
we
help
him
make
things
grow
with
our
spade
and
rake
and
hoe
first
we
spade
the
ground
then
rake
it
ready
for
the
seeds
we
make
it
then
in
furrows
carefully
plant
them
as
they
ought
to
be
soon
above
the
ground
we
spy
tiny
green
things
push
and
pry
little
plants
that
from
their
night
wake
and
climb
to
find
the
light
they
are
thirsty
so
we
give
water
first
that
they
may
live
then
the
weeds
we
vanquish
so
each
wee
shoot
may
thrive
and
grow
busy
raindrops
light
and
air
haste
to
come
our
work
to
share
for
to
them
too
every
one
gardening
is
heaps
of
fun
illustration
they
are
thirsty
so
we
give
water
first
that
they
may
live
fairy
town
a
lullaby
in
fairy
town
in
fairy
town
where
fairy
folk
go
up
and
down
where
fairy
children
wee
and
gay
frisk
and
romp
in
fairy
play
every
day
a
holiday
and
every
night
is
sweeter
still
for
when
behind
the
fairy
hill
the
tiny
fairy
sun
goes
down
it
sleepy
time
in
fairy
town
sleepy

town
sleep

while
the
stars
of
fairy
town
safe
watch
keep
all
the
fairy
babies
so
off
to
dreamland
softly
go
sleep
sleep
sleep
in
fairy
town
in
fairy
town
each
baby
in
a
moonlight
gown
lies
and
dreams
the
livelong
night
fairy
babies
are
so
white
white
and
pink
and
wee
and
bright
petals
of
a
rose
make
a
fairy
baby
girl
autumn
leaves
all
dear
and
brown
make
the
boys
of
fairy
town
sleepy
time
in
fairy
town
sleep
sleep

while
the
stars
of
fairy
town
safe
watch
keep
like
the
fairy
babies
go
off
to
dreamland
softly
so
sleep

that
way
no

how
i

and

a
star
that
it
would
