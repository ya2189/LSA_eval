thanks

article
in

most
anatomy
skeletons
come
from

the
indian
government
has
placed
a

on

skeletons
at

students
share

four

of
which
have
to
be
replaced

of

department
says
the

take
good

say

boca
might
well
have
studied
such
eventualities
boca
was
a
writer
more
accurately
a
with
the
written
phrase
deftly
painting
the
catchy
with
effortless
ease
and
grace
boca
knew
his
craft
be
it
the
arena
of
story
poem
drama
it
did
matter
the
genre
unfortunately
his
oeuvre
remained
fixed
and
static
boca
never
progressed
beyond
titles
a
right
jolly
good
thing
too
said
boca
in
his
own
defense
the
short
burst
counted
most
whether
in
thought
sport
or
field
of
battle
the
utterance
of
a
single
breath
that
was
it
it
all
lay
in
the
aside
the
pun
a
retort
the
récit
if
this
were
all
to
the
story
there
would
be
no
doubt
whatsoever
boca
excelled
in
the
briefest
expression
perhaps
said
the
critics
but
as
they
were
quick
to
point
out
it
did
lead
anywhere
where
is
the
larger
more
important
fruit
his
finished
verbal
passion
intoned
one
still
this
chance
fortune
led
to
the
inspiration
and
success
of
unusually
vivid
titles
but
titles
just
titles
said
others
nervously
yes
proclaimed
boca
titles
not
epithets
or
rejoinders
even
repartee
not
even
wit
in
the
normal
understanding
of
the
term
just
mere
titles
of
them
worried
looks
crept
onto
the
onlookers
faces
encyclopaedic
came
the
flowering
ad
factories
should
have
tapped
such
a
larder
any
creative
department
could
have
done
worse
than
with
boca
dripping
imagery
and
gift
for
the
keynote
phrase
there
is
majesty
here
said
one
and
more
than
a
little
blake
i
am
reminded
of
the
great
symbolists
one
has
to
be
practical
cautioned
still
another
here
is
hardly
epigrammatic
or
even
purely
an
aphorism
in
any
truer
sense
of
the
word
i
simply
perplexed
said
the
man
finally
to
his
colleague
and
both
left
without
further
ado
or
thought
to
boca
work
indeed
boca
loved
his
words
tinkering
with
the
very
essence
of
language
a
great
beginning
cheered
a
rare
voice
let
hope
one
without
premature
end
boca
continued
to
conceive
titles
by
the
hundreds
he
did
merely
dream
up
a
few
in
snatches
he
proliferated
them
in
vaster
and
vaster
quantities
it
was
if
a
salmon
left
to
spawn
could
endanger
a
sea
shelf
or
river
bed
under
the
sheer
quantity
of
her
seed
a
explosion
at
the
typewriter
chortled
an
onlooker
happening
to
see
the
quantity
of
boca
largesse
that
was
before
he
stopped
to
inquire
of
the
nature
of
boca
work
then
perturbed
this
same
man
hurried
away
to
the
utter
indifference
of
boca
who
kept
a
steady
pounding
in
spite
of
the
interruption
on
they
came
more
and
more
titles
by
the
hundreds
for
scripts
larger
dramas
treatises
epistles
monologues
all
and
all
without
a
scarce
concern
for
their
ultimate
use
are
we
to
believe
each
one
came
to
naught
as
the
sceptics
predicted
after
all
in
this
practical
world
who
has
use
for
dreamers
we
already
know
boca
was
stymied
at
the
title
level
nothing
ever
graced
his
newborn
creation
beyond
that
first
utterance
it
was
like
sending
a
baby
into
the
world
without
proper
bedding
or
clothes
one
nastier
commentator
even
alluded
to
boca
work
as
the
equivalent
of
premature
ejaculation
all
buildup
with
no
satisfaction
the
promise
he
chuckled
without
the
delivery
and
that
is
what
came
to
pass
each
of
boca
titles
true
to
prediction
came
to
naught
or
rather
nothing
much
blank
a
zero
with
each
title
one
ran
aground
on
the
larger
abyss
of
its
central
problem
that
being
as
boca
had
been
warned
by
his
legion
of
critics
one
of
size
what
good
are
titles
without
textual
description
chapters
scenes
the
overview
said
one
literary
agent
gruffly
boca
taking
a
respite
from
his
typewriter
had
had
the
temerity
to
approach
one
such
man
in
the
comfort
of
his
office
with
reams
of
suggestions
indeed
people
shook
their
heads
at
boca
always
scribbling
furiously
always
working
but
apparently
accomplishing
precious
next
to
nothing
something
was
evidently
being
done
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
but
what
what
could
his
well
problem
be
explained
one
vocal
opponent
of
boca
urged
what
the
hell
is
he
up
to
strangely
enough
for
the
seemingly
longest
time
this
did
not
deter
boca
he
was
his
own
universe
his
feet
were
on
solid
ground
the
air
about
him
teemed
with
ideas
he
was
too
busy
fishing
for
the
mot
juste
he
explained
in
a
moment
of
clarification
one
man
in
the
right
is
a
majority
proclaimed
boca
remembering
a
snippet
of
john
stuart
mill
too
busy
was
boca
replanning
the
structure
of
the
colosseum
so
it
might
better
accommodate
his
label
his
notion
his
version
of
the
ideal
verbal
escort
to
accompany
that
ancient
edifice
and
write
boca
did
titles
fell
increasingly
from
his
pen
the
barking
tree
the
leaking
river
these
were
but
two
boca
thought
he
would
improve
on
tolkein
efforts
at
least
in
the
direction
of
title
after
all
to
send
a
work
into
the
reader
lap
without
proper
introduction
was
like
trying
to
get
acquainted
without
the
proper
introduction
maybe
boca
had
a
point
assembly
without
hope
and
nirvana
without
end
touched
on
his
mystical
stage
he
dropped
this
and
proceeded
into
the
area
of
historiography
and
afterwards
dry
epistemology
would
see
him
concentrate
his
efforts
these
forums
were
indeed
worthy
of
his
attention
too
long
had
they
been
neglected
all
were
in
need
of
good
metaphoric
dusting
by
title
at
last
word
boca
was
inching
toward
kant
critique
of
pure
reason
that
one
in
particular
has
a
poor
ring
he
was
heard
to
say
on
they
came
precise
or
so
he
thought
they
made
the
mind
eye
swell
with
the
promise
of
more
and
more
indeed
that
eye
could
get
bloodshot
reading
all
of
boca
interception
but
the
more
in
the
sense
of
the
the
delivery
or
accompaniment
of
pages
never
came
nowhere
was
there
to
be
found
the
hemingway
to
follow
the
moveable
feast
or
the
edible
woman
even
the
promise
of
thrillers
for
a
scary
submarine
epic
like
three
eggs
on
my
plate
never
materialized
nothing
just
titles
more
then
more
and
increasingly
more
of
them
annoyingly
so
scraps
of
paper
decorating
a
table
without
an
intended
victim
ever
coming
close
it
was
as
if
so
many
salesgirls
had
left
price
tags
off
matching
merchandise
that
all
that
remained
just
the
stickers
forlornly
white
and
detached
staring
up
from
their
adhesiveness
more
than
just
a
little
tacky
a
woman
given
to
comparison
confronted
boca
imagine
a
zoo
where
the
curators
had
all
the
animal
names
but
they
were
not
paired
with
their
owners
your
stuff
everything
in
a
weird
isolation
boca
could
not
be
borca
and
not
even
carl
sagan
could
rescue
him
no
large
bottles
floating
in
formaldehyde
with
the
decapitated
heads
from
belle
epoque
sailors
were
possible
here
boca
was
more
obscure
than
gaspirilla
island
more
so
and
a
final
verdict
if
there
is
need
for
one
can
be
seen
in
boca
last
will
and
testimony
he
let
it
be
known
of
his
intention
to
chisel
the
ultimate
one
to
grace
his
own
tombstone
on
this
he
set
to
work
with
a
last
burst
of
frenzy
to
mirror
my
fate
as
he
would
have
said
perhaps
boca
is
still
at
work
either
on
the
snappy
final
wording
the
right
elasticity
or
in
the
mechanics
of
the
engraving
itself
only
a
could
estimate
the
probable
expenditure
in
time
for
the
latter
novelists
in
dire
need
of
fresh
insights
should
enlist
boca
he
definitely
available
if
difficult
to
reach
boca
might
have
rescued
many
a
masterpiece
from
the
dustbin
if
not
the
box
office
had
his
specialty
been
known
i
look
at
boca
and
hear
fire
bells
his
plight
remains
the
very
stuff
of
tragedy
by
epic
standards
how
many
bocas
are
there
worthy
of
a
balladeer
and
myth
maker
credible
boca
may
be
but
understandable
boca
the
metaphoric
equivalent
of
a
sisyphus
chained
to
his
rock
of
obsession
this
horrible
rock
or
pebble
depending
on
your
viewpoint
wailed
boca
i
become
my
own
obstacle
my
work
is
the
personification
of
my
own
limitation
worse
imprisoned
in
an
inescapable
logic
and
the
narrow
confines
of
a
blink
of
talent
work
in
progress
two
chinese
fellows
approached
me
in
a
london
suburb
they
were
eager
for
talk
karl
marx
tomb
they
implored
directions
to
the
tomb
please
they
were
pronouncing
tomb
as
if
it
rhymed
with
home
suited
up
in
their
mao
jackets
and
identically
dressed
without
hint
to
rank
or
station
they
struck
me
as
strangely
odd
even
on
the
thoroughfares
of
a
metropolitan
city
i
had
noticed
they
wore
no
green
armband
common
to
other
communist
dignitaries
the
smaller
of
the
two
became
insistent
i
nodded
and
smiled
at
the
mention
of
marx
name
for
it
was
highgate
and
yes
he
was
interred
in
the
rambling
cemetery
near
by
yes
i
had
visited
the
grave
but
was
no
means
clear
it
was
a
grave
they
had
come
all
this
way
to
visit
they
were
shy
but
puzzled
at
my
redirection
of
their
query
i
pointed
out
there
was
no
home
as
they
were
pronouncing
it
but
only
a
grave
it
was
then
that
their
enunciation
and
the
silent
murder
of
the
letter
t
came
back
to
me
like
the
cockney
unable
to
say
h
in
elocution
class
their
confusion
was
furthered
by
knowing
only
one
word
for
final
resting
place
my
own
use
of
grave
was
causing
them
grave
concern
they
were
looking
curiously
at
one
another
i
doubt
if
they
had
ever
heard
north
american
accented
english
i
might
have
been
their
first
authentic
american
short
of
a
simulated
war
games
exercise
certainly
though
all
cities
are
polyglots
i
had
never
seen
two
so
authentically
attired
citizens
of
the
people
republic
it
was
an
amusing
moment
life
with
the
of
the
unspoken
i
gave
them
their
dues
they
had
their
directions
they
pranced
off
smartly
and
melted
into
the
morning
traffic
and
i
thought
of
trying
to
explain
that
marx
at
least
in
unofficial
circles
here
is
not
considered
with
their
same
deference
i
sorry
if
this
jars
with
what
you
been
told
wu
and
no
this
is
not
lies
the
truth
is
han
marx
was
a
chiseler
he
died
owing
nearly
every
wage
earner
in
the
village
talk
of
irony
and
final
verdicts
how
one
who
numbers
among
the
age
savants
could
so
brazenly
ignore
such
hard
economic
fact
seemed
incredible
to
me
skulduggery
aside
such
a
thing
even
if
only
partially
true
would
be
scant
tribute
to
the
fabled
man
i
thought
of
the
british
museum
collection
of
his
writings
then
remembered
it
mentioned
nothing
of
this
fact
glowing
tributes
of
course
but
no
unofficial
flack
and
i
thought
of
the
possibility
of
a
third
world
war
being
in
part
based
on
this
development
marx
embitterment
that
is
his
inability
to
pay
even
the
most
modest
debt
through
his
writing
and
should
there
ever
come
another
global
catastrophe
i
imagined
how
marx
would
extend
his
wrath
at
the
doctrine
of
dialectic
materialism
doorstep
between
the
incompatibility
of
work
and
her
governing
classes
exportable
revolution
the
decadent
bourgeoisie
struggling
to
maintain
their
stranglehold
on
comfort
the
gospel
completely
according
to
karl
that
would
be
without
considering
the
question
of
alleged
incest
with
his
daughter
but
then
most
everything
in
the
marx
story
is
alleged
the
alleged
politics
of
confrontation
the
alleged
incompatibility
of
those
who
toil
with
their
rulers
the
alleged
inertia
of
labourers
even
to
the
degree
of
their
exploitation
and
yes
the
alleged
superiority
of
any
one
system
over
another
of
course
reference
would
be
made
to
the
irony
of
marx
being
buried
and
remaining
interred
throughout
the
years
in
one
of
the
most
class
conscious
nations
on
earth
where
every
accent
and
syllable
decrees
one
station
in
life
where
every
utterance
labels
the
speaker
according
to
rank
and
social
standing
by
rigid
calling
i
thought
of
myself
discussing
such
things
with
the
perturbed
yet
unmovable
ideologues
of
the
democratic
republic
of
china
did
they
know
marx
friend
and
colleague
engels
kept
a
mistress
did
they
care
that
marx
disapproved
imagine
using
the
word
grave
in
the
same
breath
as
grave
offence
to
discuss
incest
glib
moralizing
the
trumpet
of
the
bourgeoisie
i
seem
to
remember
disdainful
no
omelettes
with
first
cracking
the
eggs
perhaps
all
communication
is
claptrap
all
these
fellows
wanted
were
directions
their
minds
were
made
up
they
were
attending
a
secular
church
walking
in
the
footsteps
of
an
earthbound
saint
no
amount
of
revisionist
thinking
could
deflect
in
their
eyes
marxian
achievement
and
you
had
to
give
marx
certain
dues
that
before
people
are
capable
of
aspiring
to
work
they
must
first
be
fed
and
all
contacts
within
life
must
inevitably
come
through
and
be
restricted
by
how
one
has
chosen
