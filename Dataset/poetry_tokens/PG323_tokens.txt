gentleness

honour
and
clean
mirth
so
cup

in
fellowship

o
mine
but
the
service

are
an
from
such
we

debarred
for
the

with

morals
does
not
suit
toot
toot
they

a

marchin
clobber

loo
loo
lulu
lulu

yea
a
trooper
of
the
forces
who
has
run
his
own
six
horses
and
faith
he
went
the
pace
and
went
it
blind
and
the
world
was
more
than
kin
while
he
held
the
ready
tin
but
the
sergeant
something
less
than
kind
we
poor
little
lambs
who
lost
our
way
baa
baa
baa
we
little
black
sheep
who
gone
astray
baa
aa
aa
out
on
the
spree
damned
from
here
to
eternity
god
ha
mercy
on
such
as
we
baa
yah
bah
oh
it
sweet
to
sweat
through
stables
sweet
to
empty
kitchen
slops
and
it
sweet
to
hear
the
tales
the
troopers
tell
to
dance
with
blowzy
housemaids
at
the
regimental
hops
and
thrash
the
cad
who
says
you
waltz
too
well
yes
it
makes
you
to
be
to
your
troop
and
branded
with
a
blasted
worsted
spur
when
you
envy
o
how
keenly
one
poor
tommy
being
cleanly
who
blacks
your
boots
and
sometimes
calls
you
if
the
home
we
never
write
to
and
the
oaths
we
never
keep
and
all
we
know
most
distant
and
most
dear
across
the
snoring
return
to
break
our
sleep
can
you
blame
us
if
we
soak
ourselves
in
beer
when
the
drunken
comrade
mutters
and
the
great
gutters
and
the
horror
of
our
fall
is
written
plain
every
secret
on
the
aching
ceiling
do
you
wonder
that
we
drug
ourselves
from
pain
we
have
done
with
hope
and
honour
we
are
lost
to
love
and
truth
we
are
dropping
down
the
ladder
rung
by
rung
and
the
measure
of
our
torment
is
the
measure
of
our
youth
god
help
us
for
we
knew
the
worst
too
young
our
shame
is
clean
repentance
for
the
crime
that
brought
the
sentence
our
pride
it
is
to
know
no
spur
of
pride
and
the
curse
of
reuben
holds
us
till
an
alien
turf
enfolds
us
and
we
die
and
none
can
tell
them
where
we
died
we
poor
little
lambs
who
lost
our
way
baa
baa
baa
we
little
black
sheep
who
gone
astray

never

stand
presently
at

great

but
there
is
neither
east
nor

border
nor

nor
birth
when
two
strong
men
stand
face
to
face
tho
they
come
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
kamal
is
out
with
twenty
men
to
raise
the
and
he
has
lifted
the
colonel
mare
that
is
the
colonel
pride
he
has
lifted
her
out
of
the
between
the
dawn
and
the
day
and
turned
the
calkins
upon
her
feet
and
ridden
her
far
away
then
up
and
spoke
the
colonel
son
that
led
a
troop
of
the
guides
there
never
a
man
of
all
my
men
can
say
where
kamal
hides
then
up
and
spoke
mahommed
khan
the
son
of
the
ressaldar
ye
know
the
track
of
the
ye
know
where
his
pickets
are
at
dusk
he
harries
the
abazai
at
dawn
he
is
into
bonair
but
he
must
go
by
fort
bukloh
to
his
own
place
to
fare
so
if
ye
gallop
to
fort
bukloh
as
fast
as
a
bird
can
fly
by
the
favour
of
god
ye
may
cut
him
off
ere
he
win
to
the
tongue
of
jagai
but
if
he
be
past
the
tongue
of
jagai
right
swiftly
turn
ye
then
for
the
length
and
the
breadth
of
that
grisly
plain
is
sown
with
kamal
men
there
is
rock
to
the
left
and
rock
to
the
right
and
low
lean
thorn
between
and
ye
may
hear
a
snick
where
never
a
man
is
the
colonel
son
has
taken
a
horse
and
a
raw
rough
dun
was
he
with
the
mouth
of
a
bell
and
the
heart
of
hell
and
the
head
of
the
the
colonel
son
to
the
fort
has
won
they
bid
him
stay
to
eat
who
rides
at
the
tail
of
a
border
thief
he
sits
not
long
at
his
meat
he
up
and
away
from
fort
bukloh
as
fast
as
he
can
fly
till
he
was
aware
of
his
father
mare
in
the
gut
of
the
tongue
of
jagai
till
he
was
aware
of
his
father
mare
with
kamal
upon
her
back
and
when
he
could
spy
the
white
of
her
eye
he
made
the
pistol
crack
he
has
fired
once
he
has
fired
twice
but
the
whistling
ball
went
wide
shoot
like
a
soldier
kamal
said
now
if
ye
can
it
up
and
over
the
tongue
of
jagai
as
blown
dustdevils
go
the
dun
he
fled
like
a
stag
of
ten
but
the
mare
like
a
barren
doe
the
dun
he
leaned
against
the
bit
and
slugged
his
head
above
but
the
red
mare
played
with
the
as
a
maiden
plays
with
a
glove
there
was
rock
to
the
left
and
rock
to
the
right
and
low
lean
thorn
between
and
thrice
he
heard
a
snick
tho
never
a
man
was
seen
they
have
ridden
the
low
moon
out
of
the
sky
their
hoofs
drum
up
the
dawn
the
dun
he
went
like
a
wounded
bull
but
the
mare
like
a
fawn
the
dun
he
fell
at
a
in
a
woful
heap
fell
he
and
kamal
has
turned
the
red
mare
back
and
pulled
the
rider
free
he
has
knocked
the
pistol
out
of
his
hand
small
room
was
there
to
strive
only
by
favour
of
mine
quoth
he
rode
so
long
alive
there
was
not
a
rock
for
twenty
mile
there
was
not
a
clump
of
tree
but
covered
a
man
of
my
own
men
with
his
rifle
cocked
on
his
knee
if
i
had
raised
my
as
i
have
held
it
low
the
little
jackals
that
flee
so
fast
were
feasting
all
in
a
row
if
i
had
bowed
my
head
on
my
breast
as
i
have
held
it
high
the
kite
that
whistles
above
us
now
were
gorged
till
she
could
not
lightly
answered
the
colonel
son
good
to
bird
and
beast
but
count
who
come
for
the
broken
meats
before
thou
makest
a
feast
if
there
should
follow
a
thousand
swords
to
carry
my
bones
away
belike
the
price
of
a
jackal
meal
were
more
than
a
thief
could
pay
they
will
feed
their
horse
on
the
standing
crop
their
men
on
the
garnered
grain
the
thatch
of
the
byres
will
serve
their
fires
when
all
the
cattle
are
slain
but
if
thou
thinkest
the
price
be
fair
thy
brethren
wait
to
sup
the
hound
is
kin
to
the
howl
dog
and
call
them
up
and
if
thou
thinkest
the
price
be
high
in
steer
and
gear
and
stack
give
me
my
father
mare
again
and
i
fight
my
own
way
back
kamal
has
gripped
him
by
the
hand
and
set
him
upon
his
feet
talk
shall
be
of
dogs
said
he
wolf
and
gray
wolf
meet
may
i
eat
dirt
if
thou
hast
hurt
of
me
in
deed
or
breath
what
dam
of
lances
brought
thee
forth
to
jest
at
the
dawn
with
death
lightly
answered
the
colonel
son
hold
by
the
blood
of
my
clan
take
up
the
mare
for
my
father
gift
by
god
she
has
carried
a
man
the
red
mare
ran
to
the
colonel
son
and
nuzzled
against
his
breast
be
two
strong
men
said
kamal
then
she
loveth
the
younger
best
so
she
shall
go
with
a
lifter
dower

rein

broidered
saddle
and
and
silver
stirrups
the
colonel

a
pistol
drew
and
held

taken
the
one
from
a
foe
said

take
the
mate
from
a

for
the
risk
of
a

thy
father
has
sent
his
son
to
me
i
send
my
son
to
him
with
that
he
whistled
his
only
son
that
dropped
from
a
he
trod
the
ling
like
a
buck
in
spring
and
he
looked
like
a
lance
in
rest
here
is
thy
master
kamal
said
leads
a
troop
of
the
guides
and
thou
must
ride
at
his
left
side
as
shield
on
shoulder
rides
till
death
or
i
cut
loose
the
tie
at
camp
and
board
and
bed
thy
life
is
his
thy
fate
it
is
to
guard
him
with
thy
head
so
thou
must
eat
the
white
queen
meat
and
all
her
foes
are
thine
and
thou
must
harry
thy
father
hold
for
the
peace
of
the
and
thou
must
make
a
trooper
tough
and
hack
thy
way
to
power
belike
they
will
raise
thee
to
ressaldar
when
i
am
hanged
in
they
have
looked
each
other
between
the
eyes
and
there
they
found
no
fault
they
have
taken
the
oath
of
the
on
leavened
bread
and
salt
they
have
taken
the
oath
of
the
on
fire
and
sod
on
the

and
the

of
the
khyber
knife
and
the
wondrous
names
of

the

he
rides

and
kamal
boy
the
dun
and
two
have
come
back
to
fort
bukloh
where
there
went
forth
but
one
and
when
they
drew
to
the
full
twenty
swords
flew
clear
there
was
not
a
man
but
carried
his
feud
with
the
blood
of
the
mountaineer
done
ha

said
the
colonel
son
up
the
steel
at
your
sides
last
night
ye
had
struck
at
a

thief
is
a

of

oh

there

when
two

stand

tho
they
come
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
the
last
suttee
not
many
years
ago
a
king
died
in
one
of
the
rajpoot
states
his
wives
disregarding
the
orders
of
the
english
against
suttee
would
have
broken
out
of
the
palace
had
not
the
gates
been
barred
but
one
of
them
disguised
as
the
king
favourite
passed
through
the
line
of
guards
and
reached
the
pyre
there
her
courage
failing
she
prayed
her
cousin
a
baron
of
the
court
to
kill
her
this
he
did
not
knowing
who
she
was
udai
chand
lay
sick
to
death
in
his
hold
by
gungra
hill
all
night
we
heard
the
ring
for
the
soul
of
the
dying
rajpoot
king
all
night
beat
up
from
the
women
wing
a
cry
that
we
could
not
still
all
night
the
barons
came
and
went
the
lords
of
the
outer
guard
all
night
the
cressets
glimmered
pale
on
ulwar
sabre
and
tonk
jezail
mewar
headstall
and
marwar
mail
that
clinked
in
the
palace
yard
in
the
golden
room
on
the
palace
roof
all
night
he
fought
for
air
and
there
was
sobbing
behind
the
screen
rustle
and
whisper
of
women
unseen
and
the
hungry
eyes
of
the
boondi
queen
on
the
death
she
might
not
share
he
passed
at
dawn
the
leaped
from
ridge
to
from
the
malwa
plains
to
the
abu
scars
and
wail
upon
wail
went
up
to
the
stars
behind
the
grim
when
they
knew
that
the
king
was
dead
the
dumb
priest
knelt
to
tie
his
mouth
and
robe
him
for
the
pyre
the
boondi
queen
beneath
us
cried
now
that
we
die
as
our
mothers
died
in
the
by
our
master
side
out
women
to
the
fire
we
drove
the
great
gates
home
apace
white
hands
were
on
the
sill
but
ere
the
rush
of
the
unseen
feet
had
reached
the
turn
to
the
open
street
the
bars
shot
down
the
beat
we
held
the
dovecot
still
a
face
looked
down
in
the
gathering
day
and
laughing
spoke
from
the
wall
they
mourn
here
let
me
by
azizun
the
lucknow
i
when
the
house
is
rotten
the
rats
must
fly
and
i
seek
another
thrall
i
ruled
the
king
as
did
queen
the
queens
rule
me
guard
them
safely
but
let
me
go
or
ever
they
pay
the
debt
they
owe
in
scourge
and
torture
she
leaped
below
and
the
grim
guard
watched
her
flee
they
knew
that
the
king
had
spent
his
soul
on
a
that
he
prayed
to
a
lucknow
god
and
kissed
the
ground
where
her
feet
had
trod
and
doomed
to
death
at
her
drunken
nod
and
swore
by
her
lightest
curl
we
bore
the
king
to
his
fathers
place
where
the
tombs
of
the
stand
where
the
gray
apes
swing
and
the
peacocks

rahman
the

fills

hills
his
grace
is
manifold
he
has
taken
toll
of
the
north
and
the
south
his
glory
reacheth
far
and
they
tell
the
tale
of
his
charity
from
balkh
to
before
the
old
peshawur
gate
where
kurd
and
kaffir
meet
the
governor
of
kabul
dealt
the
justice
of
the
street
and
that
was
strait
as
running
noose

as

knife

he
who
held
the
longer
purse
might
hold
the
longer
life
there
was
a
hound
of
hindustan
had
struck
a
euzufzai
wherefore
they
spat
upon
his
face
and
led
him
out
to
die
it
chanced
the
king
went
forth
that
hour
when
throat
was
bared
to
knife
the
kaffir
grovelled
and
clamoured
for
his
life
then
said
the
king
hope
o
friend
yea
death
disgraced
is
hard
much
honour
shall
be
and
called
the
captain
of
the
guard
yar
khan
a
bastard
of
the
blood
so
saith
and
he
was
honoured
of
the
king
the
which
is
salt
to
death
and
he
was
son
of
daoud
shah
the
reiver
of
the
plains
and
blood
of
old
durani
lords
ran
fire
in
his
veins
and
was
to
tame
an
afghan
pride
nor
hell
nor
heaven
could
bind
the
king
would
make
him
butcher
to
a
yelping
cur
of
hind
said
the
king
blood
art
thou
his
death
shall
be
his
pride
then
louder
that
the
crowd
might
catch
not
his
arms
are
tied
yar
khan
drew
clear
the
khyber
knife
and
struck
and
sheathed
again

thy
will
is
done
quoth

this
dog
hath
rahman
the

chief
to

to
a
ghilzai
flag
unrolled
when
the
big
guns
speak
to
the
khyber
peak
and
his
fly
ye
have
heard
the
song
how
long
how
long
wolves
of
the
abazai
that
night
before
the
watch
was
set
when
all
the
streets
were
clear
the
governor
of
kabul
spoke
king
hast
thou
no
fear
thou
knowest
thou
hast
heard
his
speech
died
at
his
master
face
and
grimly
said
the
afghan
king

the
afghan
race
my
path
is
mine
see
thou
to
thine
upon
thy
bed
think
who
there

now
that
clamour
for
thy
that
night
when
all
the
gates
were
shut
to
city
and
to
throne
within
a
little
the
king
lay
down
alone
before
the
sinking
of
the
moon
which
is
the
night
of
night
yar
khan
came
softly
to
the
king
to
make
his
honour
white
the
children
of
the
town
had
mocked
beneath
his
horse
hoofs
the
harlots
of
the
town
had
hailed
him
from
their
roofs
but
as
he
groped
against
the
wall
two
hands
upon
him
fell
the
king
behind
his
shoulder
spake
man
thou
dost
not
well
is
ill
to
jest
with
kings
by
day
and
seek
a
boon
by
night
and
that
thou
bearest
in
thy
hand
is
all
too
sharp
to
write
but
three
days
hence
if
god
be
good
and
if
thy
strength
remain
thou
shalt
demand
one
boon
of
me
and
bless
me
in
thy
pain
for
i
am
merciful
to
all
and
most
of
all
to
thee
my
butcher
of
the
shambles
rest
no
knife
hast
thou
for
me
rahman
the
durani
chief
holds
hard
by
the
south
and
the
north
but
the
ghilzai
knows
ere
the
melting
snows
when
the
swollen
banks
break
forth
when
the
crawl
to
the
sungar
wall
and
his
usbeg
lances
fail
ye
have
heard
the
song
how
long
how
long
wolves
of
the
zuka
kheyl
they
stoned
him
in
the
when
dawn
was
in
the
sky
according
to
the
written
word
that
he
do
not
they
stoned
him
till
the
stones
were
piled
above
him
on
the
plain
and
those
the
labouring
limbs
displaced
they
tumbled
back
again
one
watched
beside
the
dreary
mound
that
veiled
the
battered
thing
and
him
the
king
with
laughter
called
the
herald
of
the
king
it
was
upon
the
second
night
the
night
of
ramazan
the
watcher
leaning
earthward
heard
the
message
of
yar
khan
from
shattered
breast
through
shrivelled
lips
broke
forth
the
rattling
breath
of
god
deliver
me
from
agony
of
they
sought
the
king
among
his
girls
and
risked
their
lives
thereby
of
the
pitiful
give
orders
that
he
die
him
endure
until
the
day
a
lagging
answer
came
night
is
short
and
he
can
pray
and
learn
to
bless
my
before
the
dawn
three
times
he
spoke
and
on
the
day
once
more
of
god
deliver
me
and
bless
the
king
therefor
they
shot
him
at
the
morning
prayer
to
ease
him
of
his
pain
and
when
he
heard
the
matchlocks
clink
he
blessed
the
king
again
which
thing
the
singers
made
a
song
for
all
the
world
to
sing
so
that
the
outer
seas
may
know
the
mercy
of
the
king
rahman
the
durani
chief
of
him
is
the
story
told
he
has
opened
his
mouth
to
the
north
and
the
south
they
have
stuffed
his
mouth
with
gold
ye
know
the
truth
of
his
tender
ruth
and
sweet
his
favours
are
ye
have
heard
the
song
how
long
how
long
from
balkh
to
the
ballad
of
the
king
jest
when
flushes
the
desert
grass
our
kafilas
wind
through
the
khyber
pass
lean
are
the
camels
but
fat
the
frails
light
are
the
purses
but
heavy
the
bales
as
the
snowbound
trade
of
the
north
comes
down
to
the
of
peshawur
town
in
a
turquoise
twilight
crisp
and
chill
a
kafila
camped
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
then
blue
of
the
cooking
rose
and
answered
to
and
the
picketed
ponies
shag
and
wild
strained
at
their
ropes
as
the
feed
was
piled
and
the
bubbling
camels
beside
the
load
sprawled
for
a
furlong
adown
the
road
and
the
persian
brought
for
sale
spat
at
the
dogs
from
the
and
the
tribesmen
bellowed
to
hasten
the
food
and
the
twinkled
by
fort
jumrood
and
there
fled
on
the
wings
of
the
gathering
dusk
a
savour
of
camels
and
carpets
and
musk
a
murmur
of
voices
a
reek
of
smoke
to
tell
us
the
trade
of
the
khyber
woke
the
lid
of
the
chattered
high
the
knives
were
whetted
and
then
came
i
to
mahbub
ali
the
muleteer
patching
his
bridles
and
counting
his
gear
crammed
with
the
gossip
of
half
a
year
but
mahbub
ali
the
kindly
said
is
speech
when
the
belly
is
so
we
plunged
the
hand
to
the
deep
in
a
cinnamon
stew
of
the
sheep
and
he
who
never
hath
tasted
the
food
by
allah
he
knoweth
not
bad
from
good
we
cleansed
our
beards
of
the
we
lay
on
the
mats
and
were
filled
with
peace
and
the
talk
slid
north
and
the
talk
slid
south
with
the
sliding
puffs
from
the
four
things
greater
than
all
things
are
women
and
horses
and
power
and
war
we
spake
of
them
all
but
the
last
the
most
for
i
sought
a
word
of
a
russian
post
of
a
shifty
promise
an
unsheathed
sword
and
a
guard
on
the
helmund
ford
then
mahbub
ali
lowered
his
eyes
in
the
fashion
of
one
who
is
weaving
lies
quoth
he
the
russians
who
can
say
when
the
night
is
gathering
all
is
gray
but
we
look
that
the
gloom
of
the
night
shall
die
in
the
morning
flush
of
a

his

was
a
clucking
khuttuck

and
the
colt
bred
close
to
the
vice
of
each
for
he
carried
the
curse
of
an
unstanched
speech
therewith
madness
so
that
he
sought
the
favour
of
kings
at
the
kabul
court
and
travelled
in
hope
of
honour
far
to
the
line
where
the
squadrons

too
but
i
saw

snatched
at
a
breath
of

that
ran
from

to

what
he
had
heard
of

spoke
gholam
hyder
the
red
chief
smiled
as
a
mother
might
on
a
babbling
child
but
those
who
would
laugh
restrained
their
breath
when
the
face
of
the
king
showed
dark
as
death
evil
it
is
in
full
durbar
to
cry
to
a
ruler
of
gathering
war
slowly
he
led
to
a
small
that
grew
by
a
cleft
of
the
city
wall
and

said
to
the

let
us
talk
of
love
with
scindia
to
delhi
than
a
hundred
years
ago
in
a
great
battle
fought
near
delhi
an
indian
prince
rode
fifty
miles
after

was
lost
with
a
who
had
loved
him
and
followed
him
in
all
his
camps
on

lost
the
girl
when
almost
within

of
safety
a
maratta
trooper
tells
the
story
the
wreath
of
banquet
overnight
lay
withered
on
the
neck
our
hands
and
scarfs
were
for
signal
of
despair
when
we
went
forth
to
paniput
to
battle
with

we
called
upon

we
gripped
them
by
the
beard
we
rolled
upon
them
like
a
flood
and
washed
their
ranks
away
the
children
of
the
hills
of
khost
before
our
lances
ran
we
drove
the
black
rohillas
back
as

what
we
began

brought
down
the
horse

and
we
trampled
them
and
passed

dyed
the
froth
of
battle
bossed
the
shield
and
roped
the
what
time
beneath
our
horses
feet
a
maiden
rose
and
cried
and
clung
to
scindia
and
i
turned
a
from
the
twain
he
set
a
spell
upon
the
maid
in
woodlands
long
ago
a
hunter
by
the
tapti
banks
she
gave
him
water
there
he
turned
her
heart
to
water
and
she
followed
to
her
woe
what
need
had
he
of
lalun
who
had
twenty
maids
as
fair
now
in
that
hour
strength
left
my
lord
he
wrenched
his
mare
aside
he
bound
the
girl
behind
him
and
we
slashed
and
struggled
free
across
the
reeling
wreck
of
strife
we
rode
as
shadows
ride
from
paniput
to
delhi
town
but
not
alone
were
we
was
populzai
laid
horse
upon
our
track
a
reiver
of
the
north
that
lusted
for
the
maid
i
might
have
barred
his
path
awhile
but
scindia
called
me
back
and
i
o
woe
for
scindia
i
listened
and
obeyed
league
after
league
the
formless
scrub
took
shape
and
glided
by
league
after
league
the
white
road
swirled
behind
the
white
mare
feet
league
after
league
when
leagues
were
done
we
heard
the
populzai
where
sure
as
time
and
swift
as
death
the
tireless
footfall
beat
noon
eye
beheld
that
shame
of
flight
the
shadows
fell
we
fled
where
steadfast
as
the
wheeling
kite
he
followed
in
our
train
the
black
wolf
warred
where
we
had
warred
the
jackal
mocked
our
dead
and
terror
born
of
made
mad
the
labouring
brain
i
gasped
kingdom
waits
my
lord
her
love
is
but
her
own
a
day
shall
mar
a
day
shall
cure
for
her
but
what
for
thee
cut
loose
the
girl
he
follows
fast
cut
loose
and
ride
alone
then
scindia
his
blistered
lips
queens
queen
shall
she
be
all
who
ate
my
bread
last
night
was
she
alone
that
came
to
seek
her
love
between
the
spears
and
find
her
crown
therein
one
shame
is
mine
what
need
the
weight
of
double
shame
if
once
we
reach
the
delhi
gate
though
all
be
lost
i
win
we
rode
the
white
mare
failed
her
trot
a
staggering
stumble
grew
the
of
even
rose
and
weltered
and
hung
low
and
still
we
heard
the
populzai
and
still
we
strained
anew
and
delhi
town
was
very
near
but
nearer
was
the
foe
yea
delhi
town
was
very
near
when
lalun
whispered
lord
of
my
life
the
mare
sinks
fast
stab
deep
and
let
me
die
but
scindia
would
not
and
the
maid
tore
free
and
flung
away
and
turning
as
she
fell
we
heard
the
clattering
populzai
then
scindia
checked
the
gasping
mare
that
rocked
and
groaned
for
breath
and
wheeled
to
charge
and
plunged
the
knife
a
in
her
side
the
hunter
and
the
hunted
know
how
that
last
pause
is
death
the
blood
had
chilled
about
her
heart
she
reared
and
fell
and
died
our
gods
were
kind
before
he
heard
the
maiden
piteous
scream
a
log
upon
the
delhi
road
beneath
the
mare
he
lay
lost
mistress
and
lost
battle
passed
before
him
like
a
dream
the
darkness
closed
about
his
eyes
i
bore
my

bossed
with

the

stiffer
with

were
lads
from

who
went

their
death
with

sooth
if

the

and

were
best
of

the
word
of
a
scout
a
march
by
night
a
rush
through
the

a
scattering

a

from

a

in

the

they
cursed
their
luck
as
the
irish
will
they
gave
him
credit
for
cunning
and
skill
they
buried
their
dead
they
bolted
their
beef
and
started
anew
on
the
track
of
the
thief
till
in
place
of
the
of
men
said
crook
and
his
darlings
come
back
with
the
they
had
hunted
the
boh
from
the
hills
to
the
plain
he
doubled
and
broke
for
the
hills
again
they
had
crippled
his
power
for
rapine
and
raid
they
had
routed
him
out
of
his
pet
stockade
and
at
last
they
came
when
the
day
star
tired
to
a
camp
deserted
a
village
fired
a
black
cross
blistered
the
and
the
body
upon
it
was
stark
and
cold
the
wind
of
the
dawn
went
merrily
past
the
high
grass
bowed
her
plumes
to
the
blast
and
out
of
the
grass
on
a
sudden
broke
a
spirtle
of
fire
a
whorl
of
smoke
and
captain
of
the
black
tyrone
was
blessed
with
a
slug
in
the
the
gift
of
his
enemy
boh
da
thone
now
a
slug
that
is
hammered
from
is
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
and
a
rankling
the
festered
as
may
in
a
steaming
barrack
at
mandalay
the
left
arm
throbbed
and
the
captain
swore
like
to
be
after
the
boh
once
more
the
fever
held
him
the
captain
said
give
a
hundred
to
look
at
his
head
the
hospital
punkahs
creaked
and
whirred
but
babu
harendra
gomashta
heard
he
thought
of
the
green
and
dank
that
girdled
his
home
by
the
dacca
tank
he
thought
of
his
wife
and
his
high
school
son
he
thought
but
abandoned
the
thought
of
a
gun
his
sleep
was
broken
by
visions
dread
of
a
shining
boh
with
a
silver
head
he
kept
his
counsel
and
went
his
way
and
swindled
the
cartmen
of
half
their
and
the
months
went
on
as
the
worst
must
do
and
the
boh
returned
to
the
raid
anew
but
the
captain
had
quitted
the
strife
and
in
far
simoorie
had
taken
a
wife
and
she
was
a
damsel
of
delicate
mould
with
hair
like
the
sunshine
and
heart
of
gold
and
little
she
knew
the
arms
that
embraced
had
cloven
a
man
from
the
brow
to
the
waist
and
little
she
knew
that
the
loving
lips
had
ordered
a
quivering
life
eclipse
and
the
eye
that
lit
at
her
lightest
breath
had
glared
unawed
in
the
gates
of
death
for
these
be
matters
a
man
would
hide
as
a
general
rule
from
an
innocent
bride
and
little
the
captain
thought
of
the
past
and
of
all
men
babu
harendra
but
slow
in
the
sludge
of
the
kathun
road
the
government
bullock
train
toted
its
load
speckless
and
spotless
and
shining
with
in
the
rearmost
cart
sat
the
and
ever
a
phantom
before
him
fled
of
a
scowling
boh
with
a
silver
head
then
the
stuck
though
the
coolies
slaved
and
the
cartmen
flogged
and
the
escort
raved
and
out
of
the
jungle
with
yells
and
squeals
pranced
boh
da
thone
and
his
gang
at
his
heels
then
belching
blunderbuss
answered
back
the
snider
snarl
and
the
carbine
crack
and
the
blithe
revolver
began
to
sing
to
the
blade
that
twanged
on
the
and
the
brown
flesh
blued
where
the
kissed
as
the
steel
shot
back
with
a
wrench
and
a
twist
and
the
great
white
bullocks
with
onyx
eyes
watched
the
souls
of
the
dead
arise
and
over
the
smoke
of
the
fusillade
the
peacock
banner
staggered
and
swayed
oh
gayest
of
scrimmages
man
may
see
is
a
rush
on
the
the
babu
shook
at
the
horrible
sight
and
girded
his
ponderous
loins
for
flight
but
fate
had
ordained
that
the
boh
should
start
on
a
raid
of
the
rearmost
cart
and
out
of
that
cart
with
a
bellow
of
woe
the
babu
fell
flat
on
the
top
of
the
boh
for
years
had
harendra
served
the
state
to
the
growth
of
his
purse
and
the
girth
of
his
there
were
twenty
stone
as
the
knows
on
the
broad
of
the
chest
of
this
best
of
bohs
and
twenty
stone
from
a
height
discharged
are
bad
for
a
boh
with
a
spleen
enlarged
oh
short
was
the
struggle
severe
was
the
shock
he
dropped
like
a
bullock
he
lay
like
a
block
and
the
babu
above
him
convulsed
with
fear
heard
the
labouring
hissed
out
in
his
ear
and
thus
in
a
fashion
undignified
the
princely
pest
of
the
chindwin
turn
now
to
simoorie
where
lapped
in
his
ease
the
captain
is
petting
the
bride
on
his
knees
where
the
of
the
bullet
the
wounded
man
scream
are
mixed
as
the
mist
of
some
devilish
dream
forgotten
forgotten
the
sweat
of
the
shambles
where
the
blooms
and
the
gray
monkey
gambols
from
the
set
free
and
released
from
the
steel
the
peace
of
the
lord
is
with

up
the
hill
to

patient
of

the

one

their

was
stopped
while
the

tore

chipped
out
the

on
the

with
a
crash

to

above
as
the
waiting
ear
yearns
for
the
whisper
of
love
from
the
arms
of
the
bride
and
slow
the
captain
bent
down
to
the
head
of
the
boh
and
as
he
looked
on
the
thing
where
it
lay
the
winking
new
spoons
and
the
napkins
array
the
freed
mind
fled
back
to
the
days
the
scuffle
the
smoke
and
the
blaze
the
forced
march
at
night
and
the
quick
rush
at
dawn
the
banjo
at
twilight
the
burial
ere
morn
the
stench
of
the
marshes
the
raw
piercing
smell
when
the
overhand
silenced
the
yell
the
oaths
of
his
irish
that
surged
when
they
stood
where
the
black
crosses
hung
the
kuttamow
flood
as
a
derelict
ship
drifts
away
with
the
tide
the
captain
went
out
on
the
past
from
his
bride
back
back
through
the
springs
to
the
chill
of
the
year
when
he
hunted
the
boh
from
maloon
to
tsaleer
as
the
shape
of
a
corpse
dimmers
up
through
deep
water
in
his
eye
lit
the
passionless
passion
of
slaughter
and
men
who
had
fought
with
for
the
life
had
gazed
on
his
face
with
less
dread
than
his
wife
for
she
who
had
held
him
so
long
could
not
hold
him
though
a
eternity
should
have
controlled
him
but
watched
the
twin
terror
the
head
turned
to
head
the
scowling
scarred
black
and
the
flushed
savage
red
the
spirit
that
changed
from
her
knowing
and
flew
to
some
grim
hidden
past
she
had
never
a
clue
to
but
it
knew
as
it
grinned
for
he
touched
it
unfearing
and
muttered
aloud
you
kept
that
jade
earring
then
nodded
and
kindly
as
friend
nods
to
friend
man
you
fought
well
but
you
lost
in
the
the
visions
departed
and
shame
followed
passion
took
what
i
said
in
this
horrible
fashion
write
to
harendra
with
language
unsainted
the
captain
came
back
to
the
had
and
this
is
a
fiction
no
go
to
simoorie
and
look
at
their
baby
a
old
houri
a
pert
little
kathleen
mavournin
she
always
about
on
the
mall
of
a
mornin

you
see
if

this
upon

the

of

o
woe

me

the
rhyme
of
the
three
captains
ballad
appears
to
refer
to
one
of
the
exploits
of
the
notorious
paul
jones
the
american
pirate
it
is
founded
on
at
the
close
of
a
winter
day
their
anchors
down
by
london
town
the
three
great
captains
lay
and
one
was
admiral
of
the
north
from
solway
firth
to
skye
and
one
was
lord
of
the
wessex
coast
and
all
the
lands
thereby
and
one
was
master
of
the
thames
from
limehouse
to
blackwall
and
he
was
captain
of
the
fleet
the
bravest
of
them
all
their
good
guns
guarded
their
great
gray
sides
that
were
thirty
foot
in
the
sheer
when
there
came
a
certain
with
news
of
a
privateer
her
rigging
was
rough
with
the
clotted
drift
that
drives
in
a
northern
breeze
her
sides
were
clogged
with
the
lazy
weed
that
spawns
in
the
eastern
seas
light
she
rode
in
the
rude
to
left
and
right
she
rolled
and
the
skipper
sat
on
the
and
stared
at
an
empty
hold
ha
paid
port
dues
for
your
law
quoth
he
where
is
the
law
ye
boast
if
i
sail
unscathed
from
a
heathen
port
to
be
robbed
on
a
christian
coast
ye
have
smoked
the
hives
of
the
laccadives
as
we
burn
the
lice
in
a
bunk
we
tack
not
now
to
a
gallang
prow
or
a
plunging
junk
i
had
no
fear
but
the
seas
were
clear
as
far
as
a
sail
might
fare
till
i
met
with
a
yankee
brig
that
rode
off
finisterre
there
were
canvas
blinds
to
his
ports
to
screen
the
weight
he
bore
and
the
signals
ran
for
a
merchantman
from
sandy
hook
to
the
nore
he
would
not
fly
the
rovers
flag
the
bloody
or
the
black
but
now
he
floated
the
gridiron
and
now
he
flaunted
the
jack
he
spoke
of
the
law
as
he
crimped
my
crew
he
swore
it
was
only
a
loan
but
when
i
would
ask
for
my
own
again
he
swore
it
was
none
of
my
own
he
has
taken
my
little
parrakeets
that
nest
beneath
the
line
he
has
stripped
my
rails
of
the
and
the
green
unripened
pine
he
has
taken
my
bale
of
dammer
and
spice
i
won
beyond
the
seas
he
has
taken
my
grinning
heathen
gods
and
what
should
he
want
o
these
my
foremast
would
not
mend
his
boom
my
deckhouse
patch
his
boats
he
has
whittled
the
two
this
yank
yahoo
to
peddle
for
oats
i
could
not
fight
for
the
failing
light
and
a
rough
beside
but
i
hulled
him
once
for
a
clumsy
crimp
and
twice
because
he
lied
had
i
had
guns
as
i
had
goods
to
work
my
christian
harm
i
had
run
him
up
from
his
to
trade
with
his
own
i
had
nailed
his
ears
to
my
and
ripped
them
off
with
a
saw
and
soused
them
in
the
bilgewater
and
served
them
to
him
raw
i
had
flung
him
blind
in
a
rudderless
boat
to
rot
in
the
rocking
dark
i
had
towed
him
aft
of
his
own
craft
a
bait
for
his
brother
shark
i
had
lapped
him
round
with
cocoa
husk
and
drenched
him
with
the
oil
and
lashed
him
fast
to
his
own
mast
to
blaze
above
my
spoil
i
had
stripped
his
hide
for
my
and
tasselled
his
beard
i
the
mesh
and
spitted
his
crew
on
the
live
bamboo
that
grows
through
the
gangrened
flesh
i
had
hove
him
down
by
the
mangroves
brown
where
the
sucks
and
draws
moored
by
the
heel
to
his
own
keel
to
wait
for
the
claws
he
is
lazar
within
and
lime
without
ye
can
nose
him
far
enow
for
he
carries
the
taint
of
a
musky
ship
the
reek
of
the
slaver
dhow
the
skipper
looked
at
the
tiering
guns
and
the
bulwarks
tall
and
cold
and
the
captains
three
full
courteously
peered
down
at
the
gutted
hold
and
the
captains
three
called
courteously
from
deck
to
sir
we
ha
dealt
with
that
merchantman
or
ever
your
teeth
were
cut
your
words
be
words
of
a
lawless
race
and
the
law
it
standeth
thus
he
comes
of
a
race
that
have
never
a
law
and
he
never
has
boarded
us
we
ha
sold
him
canvas
and
rope
and
spar
we
know
that
his
price
is
fair
and
we
know
that
he
weeps
for
the
lack
of
a
law
as
he
rides
off
finisterre
and
since
he
is
damned
for
a
by
you
and
better
than
you
we
hold
it
meet
that
the
english
fleet
should
know
that
we
hold
him
the
skipper
called
to
the
tall
taffrail
what
is
that
to
me
did
ever
you
hear
of
a
yankee
brig
that
rifled
a
do
i
loom
so
large
from
your
that
i
lift
like
a
ship
o
the
line
he
has
learned
to
run
from
a
shotted
gun
and
harry
such
craft
as
mine
there
is
never
a
law
on
the
cocos
keys
to
hold
a
white
man
in
but
we
do
not
steal
the
niggers
meal
for
that
is
a
nigger
sin
must
he
have
his
law
as
a
quid
to
chaw
or
laid
in
brass
on
his
wheel
does
he
steal
with
tears
when
he
buccaneers
gad
then
why
does
he
steal
the
skipper
bit
on
a
word
and
the
word
it
was
not
sweet
for
he
could
see
the
captains
three
had
signalled
to
the
fleet
but
three
and
two
in
white
and
blue
the
whimpering
flags
began
have
heard
a
tale
of
a
foreign

beneath
his

the
halliards
twanged
against

within

won
from
an
ancient
foe
as
it

ago
and
as
it
still

be
the
ballad
of

again
rolling
down

met
the

gales
seven
days
and
seven
nights
to

we
drifted
racketing
her

loose
white
as
snow
all
the

adrift
adeck
half
the
rails
below
leaking
like
a
steering
like

out
we
took
the
out
across
the
bay
one
by
one
the
lights
came
up
winked
and
let
us
by
mile
by
mile
we
waddled
on
coal
and
short
met
a
blow
that
laid
us
down
heard
a
bulkhead
fly
left
the
behind
us
with
a
list
to
port
trailing
like
a
wounded
duck
working
out
her
soul
clanging
like
a
after
every
roll
just
a
funnel
and
a
mast
lurching
through
the
spray
so
we
threshed
the
out
across
the
bay
her
hog
and
felt
her
sag
betted
when
she
break
wondered
every
time
she
raced
if
she
stand
the
shock
heard
the
seas
like
drunken
men
pounding
at
her
strake
hoped
the
lord
keep
his
thumb
on
the
banged
against
the
iron
decks
bilges
choked
with
coal
flayed
and
frozen
foot
and
hand
sick
of
heart
and
soul
last
we
prayed
she
buck
herself
into
judgment
day
hi
we
cursed
the
knocking
round
the
bay
o
her
nose
flung
up
to
sky
groaning
to
be
still
up
and
down
and
back
we
went
never
time
for
breath
then
the
money
paid
at
lloyd
caught
her
by
the
heel
and
the
stars
ran
round
and
round
dancin
at
our
death
aching
for
an
hour
sleep
dozing
off
between
the
rotten
rivets
draw
when
she
took
it
green
the
compass
chase
its
tail
like
a
cat
at
play
that
was
on
the
south
across
the
bay
once
we
saw
between
the
squalls
lyin

to
swell
mad
with
work
and
weariness
wishin
they
was
we
some
damned
liner
lights

by
like

hotel
cheered
her
from

swampin
in

then
a

cleared
us
out
then
the
skipper
laughed
the
wheel
has
gone
to
hell
rig
the
winches
aft
yoke
the
kicking
get
her
under

so
we
steered
her
out
across

puttied
up
with

the

the

to

give
him
ewes
and
cheat
his

or
leave
his

unlighted
as

unlighted

forgot
taman
when
all
the
valley
followed
after
kysh
and
yabosh
little
gods
but
very
wise
and
from
the
sky
taman
beheld
their
sin
he
sent
the
sickness
out
upon
the
hills
the
red
horse
sickness
with
the
iron
hooves
to
turn
the
valley
to
taman
again
and
the
red
horse
snuffed
thrice
into
the
wind
the
naked
wind
that
had
no
fear
of
him
and
the
red
horse
stamped
thrice
upon
the
snow
the
naked
snow
that
had
no
fear
of
him
and
the
red
horse
went
out
across
the
rocks
the
ringing
rocks
that
had
no
fear
of
him
and
downward
where
the
lean
birch
meets
the
snow
and
downward
where
the
gray
pine
meets
the
birch
and
downward
where
the
dwarf
oak
meets
the
pine
till
at
his
feet
our
pastures
lay
that
night
the
slow
mists
of
the
evening
dropped
dropped
as
a
cloth
upon
a
dead
man
face
and
weltered
in
the
valley
like
water
very
silent
spread
abroad
like
water
very
silent
from
the
shrine
unlighted
of
taman
to
where
the
stream
is
dammed
to
fill
our
sent
up
white
waves
that
rocked
and
heaved
and
then
were
still
till
all
the
valley
glittered
like
a
marsh
beneath
the
moonlight
filled
with
sluggish
mist
so
that
men
waded
as
they
walked
that
night
the
red
horse
grazed
above
the
dam
beyond
the
men
heard
him
feed
and
those
that
heard
him
sickened
where
they
lay
thus
came
the
sickness
to
and
slew
ten
men
strong
men
and
of
the
women
four
and
the
red
horse
went
hillward
with
the
dawn
but
near
the
his
lay
that
night
the
slow
mists
of
the
evening
dropped
dropped
as
a
cloth
upon
the
dead
but
rose
a
little
higher
to
a
young
girl
height
till
all
the
valley
glittered
like
a
lake
beneath
the
moonlight
filled
with
sluggish
mist
that
night
the
red
horse
grazed
beyond
the
dam
a
from
the
troughs
men
heard
him
feed
and
those
that
heard
him
sickened
where
they
lay
thus
came
the
sickness
to
and
slew
of
men
a
score
and
of
the
women
eight
and
of
the
children
two
because
the
road
to
gorukh
was
a
road
of
enemies
and
was
blocked
with
early
snow
we
could
not
flee
from
out
the
valley
death
smote
at
us
in
a
and
kysh
was
mute
as
yabosh
though
the
goats
were
slain
and
the
red
horse
grazed
nightly
by
the
stream
and
later
outward
towards
the
unlighted
shrine
and
those
that
heard
him
sickened
where
they
lay
then
said
bisesa
to
the
priests
at
dusk
when
the
white
mist
rose
up
and
choked
the
voices
in
the
houses
of
the
dead
and
kysh
avail
not
if
the
horse
reach
the
unlighted
shrine
we
surely
die
ye
have
forgotten
of
all
gods
the
chief
taman
here
rolled
the
thunder
through
the
hills
and
yabosh
shook
upon
his
pedestal
have
forgotten
of
all
gods
the
chief
too
and
all
were
dumb
save
one
who
cried
on
yabosh
with
the
sapphire
his
knees
but
found
no
answer
in
the
smoky
roof
and
being
smitten
of
the
sickness
died
before
the
altar
of
the
sapphire
shrine
then
said
bisesa
am
near
to
death
and
have
the
wisdom
of
the
grave
for
gift
to
bear
me
on
the
path
my
feet
must
tread
if
there
be
wealth
on
earth
then
i
am
rich
for
armod
is
the
first
of
all
if
there
be
beauty
on
the
earth
her
eyes
dropped
for
a
moment
to
the
temple
floor
know
that
i
am
fair
if
there
be
love
ye
know
that
love
is
the
chief
in
war
the
man
of
sixty
spears
broke
from
the
press
and
would
have
clasped
her
but
the
priests
withstood
saying
has
a
message
from
then
said
bisesa
my
wealth
and
love
and
beauty
i
am
chosen
of
the
god
here
rolled
the
thunder
through
the
hills
and
kysh
fell
forward
on
the
mound
of
skulls
in
darkness
and
before
our
priests
the
maid
between
the
altars
cast
her
bracelets
down
therewith
the
heavy
earrings
armod
made
when
he
was
young
out
of
the
of
gorukh
threw
the
thick
with
jade
upon
the
turquoise
anklets
put
aside
the
bands
of
silver
on
her
brow
and
neck
and
as
the
trinkets
tinkled
on
the
stones
the
thunder
of
taman
lowed
like
a
bull
then
said
bisesa
stretching
out
her
hands
as
one
in
darkness
fearing
devils
o
priests
i
am
a
woman
very
weak
and
who
am
i
to
know
the
will
of
gods
taman
hath
called
me
whither
shall
i
go
the
chief
in
war
the
man
of
sixty
spears
howled
in
his
torment
fettered
by
the
priests
but
dared
not
come
to
her
to
drag
her
forth
and
dared
not
lift
his
spear
against
the
priests
then
all
men
wept
there
was
a
priest
of
kysh
bent
with
a
hundred
winters
hairless
blind
and
taloned
as
the
great
is
his
seat
was
nearest
to
the
and
he
was
counted
dumb
among
the
priests
but
whether
kysh
decreed
or
from
taman
the
impotent
tongue
found
utterance
we
know
as
little
as
the
bats
beneath
the
eaves
he
cried
so
that
they
heard
who
stood
without
the
unlighted
shrine
and
crept
aside
into
the
shadow
of
his
fallen
god
and
whimpered
and
bisesa
went
her
way
that
night
the
slow
mists
of
the
evening
dropped
dropped
as
a
cloth
upon
the
dead
and
rose
above
the
roofs
and
by
the
unlighted
shrine
lay
as
the
slimy
water
of
the
troughs
when
murrain
thins
the
cattle
of
and
through
the
mist
men
heard
the
red
horse
feed
in
armod
house
they
burned
bisesa
dower
and
killed
her
black
bull
tor
and
broke
her
wheel
and
loosed
her
hair
as
for
the
with
cries
more
loud
than
mourning
for
the
dead
across
the
fields
from
armod
we
heard
bisesa
weeping
where
she
passed
to
seek
the
unlighted
shrine
the
red
horse
neighed
and
followed
her
and
on
the
his
hooves
struck
dead
and
heavy
in
our
ears
out
of
the
mists
of
evening
as
the
star
of
climbs
through
the
black
to
show
the
pass
is
clear
bisesa
stepped
upon
the
great
gray
slope
of
mortised
stone
the
causeway
of
taman
the
red
horse
neighed
behind
her
to
the
unlighted
shrine
then
fled
north
to
the
mountain
where
his
stable
lies
they
know
who
dared
the
anger
of
taman
and
watched
that
night
above
the
clinging
mists
far
up
the
hill
bisesa
passing
in
she
set
her
hand
upon
the
carven
door
fouled
by
a
myriad
bats
and
black
with
time
whereon
is
graved
the
glory
of
taman
in
letters
older
than
the
and
twice
she
turned
aside
and
twice
she
wept
cast
down
upon
the
threshold
clamouring
for
him
she
loved
the
man
of
sixty
spears
and
for
her
father
and
the
black
bull
tor
hers
and
her
pride
yea
twice
she
turned
away
before
the
awful
darkness
of
the
door
and
the
great
horror
of
the
wall
of
man
where
man
is
made
the
plaything
of
taman
an
eyeless
face
that
waits
above
and
laughs
but
the
third
time
she
cried
and
put
her
palms
against
the
hewn
stone
leaves
and
prayed
taman
to
spare
and
take
her
life
for
price
they
know
who
watched
the
doors
were
rent
apart
and
closed
upon
bisesa
and
the
rain
broke
like
a
flood
across
the
valley
washed
the
mist
away
but
louder
than
the
rain
the
thunder
of
taman
filled
men
with
fear
some
say
that
from
the
unlighted
shrine
she
cried
for
succour
very
pitifully
thrice
and
others
that
she
sang
and
had
no
fear
and
some
that
there
was
neither
song
nor
cry
but
only
thunder
and
the
lashing
rain
howbeit
in
the
morning
men
rose
up
perplexed
with
horror
crowding
to
the
shrine
and
when
was
gathered
at
the
doors
the
priests
made
lamentation
and
passed
in
to
a
strange
temple
and
a
god
they
feared
but
knew
not
from
the
crevices
the
grass
had
thrust
the
apart
the
walls
were
gray
with
stains
unclean
the
swelled
with
growth
of
rottenness
and
lichen
veiled
the
image
of
taman
in
leprosy
the
basin
of
the
blood
above
the
altar
held
the
morning
sun
a
winking
ruby
on
its
heart
below
face
hid
in
hands
the
maid
bisesa
lay
beyond
the
hills
of
bears
witness
to
the
truth
and
hath
told
the
men
of
gorukh
thence
the
tale
comes
westward
the
peaks
to
india
the
explanation
love
and
death
once
ceased
their
strife
at
the
tavern
of
man
life
called
for
wine
and
threw
alas
each
his
quiver
on
the
grass
when
the
bout
was
they
found
mingled
arrows
strewed
the
ground
hastily
they
gathered
then
each
the
loves
and
lives
of
men
ah
the
fateful
dawn
deceived
mingled
arrows
each
one
sheaved
death
dread
armoury
was
stored
with
the
shafts
he
most
abhorred

groaned
beneath
darts
of
death
thus
it
was
they
wrought
our
woe
at
the
tavern
long
ago
tell
me
do
our
masters
know
loosing
blindly
as
they
fly
old
men
love
while
young
men
die
the
gift
of
the
sea
the
dead
child
lay
in
the
shroud
and
the
widow
watched
beside
and
her
mother
slept
and
the
channel
swept
the
gale
in
the
teeth
of
the
tide
but
the
mother
laughed
at
all
have
lost
my
man
in
the
sea
and
the
child
is
dead
be
still
she
said
more
can
ye
do
to
me
the
widow
watched
the
dead
and
the
candle
guttered
low
and
she
tried
to
sing
the
passing
song
that
bids
the
poor
soul
go
and
take
you
now
she
sang
lay
against
my
and
smooth
your
crib
but
she
could
not
say
then
came
a
cry
from
the
sea
but
the
blinded
the
glass
and
ye
nothing
mother
she
said
the
child
that
waits
to
and
the
nodding
mother
sighed
a
lambing
ewe
in
the
whin
for
why
should
the
christened
soul
cry
out
that
never
knew
of
sin
feet
i
have
held
in
my
hand
o
hands
at
my
heart
to
catch
how
should
they
know
the
road
to
go
and
how
should
they
lift
the
latch
they
laid
a
sheet
to
the
door
with
the
little
quilt
atop
that
it
might
not
hurt
from
the
cold
or
the
dirt
but
the
crying
would
not
stop
the
widow
lifted
the
latch
and
strained
her
eyes
to
see
and
opened
the
door
on
the
bitter
shore
to
let
the
soul
go
free
there
was
neither
glimmer
nor
ghost
there
was
neither
spirit
nor
spark
and
ye
nothing
mother
she
said
crying
for
me
in
the
and
the
nodding
mother
sighed
sorrow
makes
ye
dull
have
ye
yet
to
learn
the
cry
of
the
tern
or
the
wail
of
the
gull
terns
are
blown
inland
the
gray
gull
follows
the
plough
was
never
a
bird
the
voice
i
heard
o
mother
i
hear
it
now
still
dear
lamb
lie
still
the
child
is
passed
from
harm
is
the
ache
in
your
breast
that
broke
your
rest
and
the
feel
of
an
empty
she
put
her
mother
aside
mary
name
let
be
for
the
peace
of
my
soul
i
must
go
she
said
and
she
went
to
the
calling
sea
in
the
heel
of
the
pier
where
the
twisted
weed
was
piled
she
came
to
the
life
she
had
missed
by
an
hour
for
she
came
to
a
little
child
she
laid
it
into
her
breast
and
back
to
her
mother
she
came
but
it
would
not
feed
and
it
would
not
heed
though
she
gave
it
her
own
child
name
and
the
dead
child
dripped
on
her
breast
and
her
own
in
the
shroud
lay
stark
and
forgive
us
mother
she
said
let
it
die
in
the
dark
evarra
and
his
gods
here
this
is
the
story
of
evarra
man
maker
of
gods
in
lands
beyond
the
because
the
city
gave
him
of
her
gold
because
the
caravans
brought
turquoises
because
his
life
was
sheltered
by
the
king
so
that
no
man
should
maim
him
none
should
steal
or
break
his
rest
with
babble
in
the
streets
when
he
was
weary
after
toil
he
made
an
image
of
his
god
in
gold
and
pearl
with
turquoise
diadem
and
human
eyes
a
wonder
in
the
sunshine
known
afar
and
worshipped
by
the
king
but
drunk
with
pride
because
the
city
bowed
to
him
for
god
he
wrote
above
the
shrine
gods
are
made
and
whoso
makes
them
otherwise
shall
and
all
the
city
praised
then
he
died
here
the
story
of
evarra
man
maker
of
gods
in
lands
beyond
the
because
the
city
had
no
wealth
to
give
because
the
caravans
were
spoiled
afar
because
his
life
was
threatened
by
the
king
so
that
all
men
despised
him
in
the
streets
he
hewed
the
living
rock
with
sweat
and
tears
and
reared
a
god
against
the
a
terror
in
the
sunshine
seen
afar
and
worshipped
by
the
king
but
drunk
with
pride
because
the
city
fawned
to
bring
him
back
he
carved
upon
the
plinth
gods
are
made
and
whoso
makes
them
otherwise
shall
and
all
the
people
praised
then
he
died
here
the
story
of
evarra
man
maker
of
gods
in
lands
beyond
the
because
he
lived
among
a
simple
folk
because
his
village
was
between
the
hills
because
he
smeared
his
cheeks
with
blood
of
ewes
he
cut
an
idol
from
a
fallen
pine
smeared
blood
upon
its
cheeks
and
wedged
a
shell
above
its
brows
for
eyes
and
gave
it
hair
of
trailing
moss
and
plaited
straw
for
crown
and
all
the
village
praised
him
for
this
craft
and
brought
him
butter
honey
milk
and
curds
wherefore
because
the
shoutings
drove
him
mad
he
scratched
upon
that
log
gods
are
made
and
whoso
makes
them
otherwise
shall
and
all
the
people
praised
then
he
died
here
the
story
of
evarra
man
maker
of
gods
in
lands
beyond
the
because
his
god
decreed
one
clot
of
blood
should
swerve
one
from
the
pulse
path
and
chafe
his
brain
evarra
mowed
alone
among
the
cattle
in
the
fields
counting
his
fingers
jesting
with
the
trees
and
mocking
at
the
mist
until
his
god
drove
him
to
labour
out
of
dung
and
horns
dropped
in
the
mire
he
made
a
monstrous
god
abhorrent
shapeless
crowned
with
plantain
tufts
and
when
the
cattle
lowed
at
he
dreamed
it
was
the
clamour
of
lost
crowds
and
howled
among
the
beasts
gods
are
made
and
whoso
makes
them
otherwise
shall
thereat
the
cattle
then
he
died
yet
at
the
last
he
came
to
paradise
and
found
his
own
four
gods
and
that
he
wrote
and
marvelled
being
very
near
to
god
what
oaf
on
earth
had
made
his
toil
god
law
till
god
said
mocking
not
these
be
then
cried
evarra
have
sinned
so
if
thou
hadst
written
otherwise
thy
gods
had
rested
in
the
mountain
and
the
mine
and
i
were
poorer
by
four
wondrous
gods
and
thy
more
wondrous
law
evarra
thine
servant
of
shouting
crowds
and
lowing
thereat
with
laughing
mouth
but
eyes
evarra
cast
his
gods
from
paradise
is
the
story
of
evarra
man
maker
of
gods
in
lands
beyond
the
the
conundrum
of
the
workshops
when
the
flush
of
a
sun
fell
first
on
eden
green
and
gold
our
father
adam
sat
under
the
tree
and
scratched
with
a
stick
in
the
mould
and
the
first
rude
sketch
that
the
world
had
seen
was
joy
to
his
mighty
heart
till
the
devil
whispered
behind
the
leaves
pretty
but
is
it
art
wherefore
he
called
to
his
wife
and
fled
to
fashion
his
work
anew
the
first
of
his
race
who
cared
a
fig
for
the
first
most
dread
review
and
he
left
his
lore
to
the
use
of
his
sons
and
that
was
a
glorious
gain
when
the
devil
chuckled
it
art
in
the
ear
of
the
branded
cain
they
fought
and
they
talked
in
the
north
and
the
south
they
talked
and
they
fought
in
the
west
till
the
waters
rose
on
the
pitiful
land
and
the
poor
red
clay
had
rest
had
rest
till
that
dank
dawn
when
the
dove
was
preened
to
start
and
the
devil
bubbled
below
the
keel
human
but
is
it
art
they
builded
a
tower
to
shiver
the
sky
and
wrench
the
stars
apart
till
the
devil
grunted
behind
the
bricks
striking
but
is
it
art
the
stone
was
dropped
at
the
and
the
idle
derrick
swung
while
each
man
talked
of
the
aims
of
art
and
each
in
an
alien
tongue
the
tale
is
as
old
as
the
eden
tree
and
new
as
the
tooth
for
each
man
knows
ere
his
grows
he
is
master
of
art
and
truth
and
each
man
hears
as
the
twilight
nears
to
the
beat
of
his
dying
heart
the
devil
drum
on
the
darkened
pane
did
it
but
was
it
art
we
have
learned
to
whittle
the
eden
tree
to
the
shape
of
a
we
have
learned
to
bottle
our
parents
twain
in
the
yelk
of
an
addled
egg
we
know
that
the
tail
must
wag
the
dog
for
the
horse
is
drawn
by
the
cart
but
the
devil
whoops
as
he
whooped
of
old
clever
but
is
it
art
when
the
flicker
of
london
sun
falls
faint
on
the
green
and
gold
the
sons
of
adam
sit
them
down
and
scratch
with
their
pens
in
the
mould
they
scratch
with
their
pens
in
the
mould
of
their
graves
and
the
ink
and
the
anguish
start
for
the
devil
mutters
behind
the
leaves
pretty
but
is
it
art
now
if
we
could
win
to
the
eden
tree
where
the
four
great
rivers
flow
and
the
wreath
of
eve
is
red
on
the
turf
as
she
left
it
long
ago
and
if
we
could
come
when
the
sentry
slept
and
softly
scurry
through
by
the
favour
of
god
we
might
know
as
much
as
our
father
adam
knew
the
legend
of
evil
i
this
is
the
sorrowful
story
told
when
the
twilight
fails
and
the
monkeys
walk
together
holding
their
neighbours
tails
fathers
lived
in
the
forest
foolish
people
were
they
they
went
down
to
the
cornland
to
teach
the
farmers
to
play
fathers
frisked
in
the
millet
our
fathers
skipped
in
the
wheat
our
fathers
hung
from
the
branches
our
fathers
danced
in
the
street
came
the
terrible
farmers
nothing
of
play
they
knew
caught
our
fathers
and
set
them
to
labour
too
them
to
work
in
the
cornland
with
ploughs
and
sickles
and
flails
put
them
in
prisons
and
cut
off
their
beautiful
tails
we
can
watch
our
fathers
sullen
and
bowed
and
old
stooping
over
the
millet
sharing
the
silly
mould
a
foolish
furrow
mending
a
muddy
yoke
sleeping
in
prisons
steeping
their
food
in
smoke
may
not
speak
to
our
fathers
for
if
the
farmers
knew
they
would
come
up
to
the
forest
and
set
us
to
labour
this
is
the
horrible
story
told

never

so
little
never

so

over

wrenched
it

sore
trampled
in
the
dirt
from

o
listen
to
my
song
the
honourable
gentlemen
have
suffered
grievous
wrong
their
noble
names
were
mentioned
o
the
burning
black
disgrace
by
a
brutal
saxon
paper
in
an
irish
they
sat
upon
it
for
a
year
then
steeled
their
heart
to
brave
it
and
the
learned
judges
gave
it
bear
witness
heaven
of
that
grim
crime
beneath
the
surgeon
knife
the
honourable
gentlemen
deplored
the
loss
of
life
bear
witness
of
those
chanting
choirs
that
burk
and
shirk
and
snigger
no

laid

upon
the

erin
now
her
honourable
gentlemen
are
cleared
and
this
is
how
they
only
paid
the
moonlighter
his
price
they
only
helped
the
murderer
with
counsel
best
advice
but
sure
it
keeps
their
honour
white
the
learned
court
believes
they
never
gave
a
piece
of
plate
to
murderers
and
thieves
they
never
told
the
ramping
crowd
to
card
a
woman
hide
they
never
marked
a
man
for
death
what
fault
of
theirs
he
died
they
only
said
and
talked
and
went
away
by
god
the
boys
that
did
the
work
were
braver
men
than
they
their
sin
it
was
that
fed
the
fire
small
blame
to
them
that
heard
the
get
drunk
on
rhetoric
and
madden
at
a

they
knew
whom
they
were
talking
at
if
they
were
irish
too
the
gentlemen
that
lied
in
court
they
knew
and
well
they
knew
they
only
took
the
from
fenians
out
of

they
only
fawned
for
dollars
on
the
if
black

they
only
traitors

shame
on
you
from

the
hand
of
every
honest
man
across
your
mouth
black
than
we
were
faith
no
word
of

was
said
the
lightest

was
human
blood
and
that
you

runs
red
it
sticking

for
all
your
sneer
and
scoff
and
by
the
judge
word
you
can
not
wipe
it
off
hold
up
those

of

go
scare
your

together
the
blundering
tripping
tups
that

if
they
snuff
the

tell
them
it

that
glistens

as
old
as

as
fresh
as

ye

they
if
their

is
shut
they
swear
the
whole

warm
what
do
they
know
of
dread
of
death
or
hanging
fear
of

the
secret
half
a

the
shriek
that
tells
the
shot

the
broken

the
dry
blood
crisping
in

the

decreed
to

of

to

in

he
sent
a

to

that
the

might
be
counted
fairly
and
the

and
some
were
black
from

and
some
were
brown
from

soil
and
some
were
blue
from
the
but
all
were
wearied
of
toil
and
the
young
king
said
have
found
it
the
road
to
the
rest
ye
seek
the
strong
shall
wait
for
the
weary
the

shall
halt
for

ye
shall
march

plenty
in

lay
on

the
strong
heads
bowed
thereby
and
a
wail
went
up
from
the
peoples
sign
give
rest
for
we
die
a
hand
was
stretched
to
the
a
fist
was
cramped
to
scrawl
when
the
laugh
of
a
maiden
ran
clear
through
the
and
each
one
heard
her
laughing
as
each
one
saw
her
plain
saidie
mimi
or
olga
gretchen
or
mary
jane
and
the
spirit
of
man
that
is
in
him
to
the
light
of
the
vision
woke
and
the
men
drew
back
from

we

now
this
is
the
tale
of
the
council
the
german
kaiser
held
the
day
that
they
razored
the
grindstone
the
day
that
the
cat
was
belled
the
day
of
the
figs
from
thistles
the
day
of
the
twisted
sands
the
day
that
the
laugh
of
a
maiden
made
light
of
the
lords
of
their
hands
tomlinson
now
tomlinson
gave
up
the
ghost
in
his
house
in
berkeley
square
and
a
spirit
came
to
his
bedside
and
gripped
him
by
the
hair
a
spirit
gripped
him
by
the
hair
and
carried
him
far
away
till
he
heard
as
the
roar
of
a
ford
the
roar
of
the
milky
way
till
he
heard
the
roar
of
the
milky
way
die
down
and
drone
and
cease
and
they
came
to
the
gate
within
the
wall
where
peter
holds
the
keys
up
stand
up
now
tomlinson
and
answer
loud
and
high
the
good
that
ye
did
for
the
sake
of
men
or
ever
ye
came
to
die
the
good
that
ye
did
for
the
sake
of
men
in
little
earth
so
lone
and
the
naked
soul
of
tomlinson
grew
white
as
a
bone
i
have
a
friend
on
earth
he
said
was
my
priest
and
guide
and
well
would
he
answer
all
for
me
if
he
were
by
my
that
ye
strove
in
it
shall
be
written
fair
but
now
ye
wait
at
heaven
gate
and
not
in
berkeley
square
though
we
called
your
friend
from
his
bed
this
night
he
could
not
speak
for
you
for
the
race
is
run
by
one
and
one
and
never
by
two
and
then
tomlinson
looked
up
and
down
and
little
gain
was
there
for
the
naked
stars
grinned
overhead
and
he
saw
that
his
soul
was
bare
the
wind
that
blows
between
the
worlds
it
cut
him
like
a
knife
and
tomlinson
took
up
his
tale
and
spoke
of
his
good
in
life
i
have
read
in
a
book
he
said
that
was
told
to
me
and
this
i
have
thought
that
another
man
thought
of
a
prince
in
the
good
souls
flocked
like
homing
doves
and
bade
him
clear
the
path
and
peter
twirled
the
jangling
keys
in
weariness
and
wrath
have
read
ye
have
heard
ye
have
thought
he
said
the
tale
is
yet
to
run
by
the
worth
of
the
body
that
once
ye
had
give
answer
what
ha
ye
done
then
tomlinson
looked
back
and
forth
and
little
good
it
bore
for
the
darkness
stayed
at
his
and
heaven
gate
before
this
i
have
felt
and
this
i
have
guessed
and
this
i
have
heard
men
say
and
this
they
wrote
that
another
man
wrote
of
a
carl
in
have
read
ye
have
felt
ye
have
guessed
good
lack
ye
have
hampered
heaven
gate
there
little
room
between
the
stars
in
idleness
to
prate
o
none
may
reach
by
hired
speech
of
neighbour
priest
and
kin
through
borrowed
deed
to
god
good
meed
that
lies
so
fair
within
get
hence
get
hence
to
the
lord
of
wrong
for
doom
has
yet
to
run
faith
that
ye
share
with
berkeley
square
uphold
you
tomlinson
the
spirit
gripped
him
by
the
hair
and
sun
by
sun
they
fell
till
they
came
to
the
belt
of
naughty
stars
that
rim
the
mouth
of
hell
the
first
are
red
with
pride
and
wrath
the
next
are
white
with
pain
but
the
third
are
black
with
clinkered
sin
that
can
not
burn
again
they
may
hold
their
path
they
may
leave
their
path
with
never
a
soul
to
mark
they
may
burn
or
freeze
but
they
must
not
cease
in
the
scorn
of
the
outer
dark
the
wind
that
blows
between
the
worlds
it
nipped
him
to
the
bone
and
he
yearned
to
the
flare
of
there
as
the
light
of
his
own
the
devil
he
sat
behind
the
bars
where
the
desperate
legions
drew
but
he
caught
the
hasting
tomlinson
and
would
not
let
him
through
ye
the
price
of
good
that
i
must
pay
said
he
ye
rank
yoursel
so
fit
for
hell
and
ask
no
leave
of
me
i
am
all
to
adam
breed
that
ye
should
give
me
scorn
for
i
strove
with
god
for
your
first
father
the
day
that
he
was
born
sit
down
sit
down
upon
the
slag
and
answer
loud
and
high
the
harm
that
ye
did
to
the
sons
of
men
or
ever
you
came
to
and
tomlinson
looked
up
and
up
and
saw
against
the
night
the
belly
of
a
tortured
star
in
light
and
tomlinson
looked
down
and
down
and
saw
beneath
his
feet
the
frontlet
of
a
tortured
star
in
heat
i
had
a
love
on
earth
said
he
kissed
me
to
my
fall
and
if
ye
would
call
my
love
to
me
i
know
she
would
answer
that
ye
did
in
love
forbid
it
shall
be
written
fair
but
now
ye
wait
at
gate
and
not
in
berkeley
square
though
we
whistled
your
love
from
her
bed
i
trow
she
would
not
run
for
the
sin
ye
do
by
two
and
two
ye
must
pay
for
one
by
one
the
wind
that
blows
between
the
worlds
it
cut
him
like
a
knife
and
tomlinson
took
up
the
tale
and
spoke
of
his
sin
in
life
i
ha
laughed
at
the
power
of
love
and
twice
at
the
grip
of
the
grave
and
thrice
i
ha
patted
my
god
on
the
head
that
men
might
call
me
the
devil
he
blew
on
a
brandered
soul
and
set
it
aside
to
cool
ye
think
i
would
waste
my
good
on
the
hide
of
a
fool
i
see
no
worth
in
the
hobnailed
mirth
or
the
jolthead
jest
ye
did
that
i
should
waken
my
gentlemen
that
are
sleeping
three
on
a
then
tomlinson
looked
back
and
forth
and
there
was
little
grace
for
filled
the
houseless
soul
with
the
fear
of
naked
space
this
i
ha
heard
quo
tomlinson
this
was
noised
abroad
and
this
i
ha
got
from
a
belgian
book
on
the
word
of
a
dead
french
ha
heard
ye
ha
read
ye
ha
got
good
lack
and
the
tale
begins
afresh
have
ye
sinned
one
sin
for
the
pride
o
the
eye
or
the
sinful
lust
of
the
flesh
then
tomlinson
he
gripped
the
bars
and
yammered
me
in
for
i
mind
that
i
borrowed
my
neighbour
wife
to
sin
the
deadly
the
devil
he
grinned
behind
the
bars
and
banked
the
fires
high
ye
read
of
that
sin
in
a
book
said
he
and
tomlinson
said
the
devil
he
blew
upon
his
nails
and
the
little
devils
ran
and
he
said
husk
this
whimpering
thief
that
comes
in
the
guise
of
a
man
winnow
him
out
star
and
star
and
sieve
his
proper
worth
there
sore
decline
in
adam
line
if
this
be
spawn
of
empusa
crew
so
they
may
not
face
the
fire
but
weep
that
they
bin
too
small
to
sin
to
the
height
of
their
desire
over
the
coal
they
chased
the
soul
and
racked
it
all
abroad
as
children
rifle
a
or
the
raven
foolish
hoard
and
back
they
came
with
the
tattered
thing
as
children
after
play
and
they
said
soul
that
he
got
from
god
he
has
bartered
clean
away
we
have
threshed
a
stook
of
print
and
book
and
winnowed
a
chattering
wind
and
many
a
soul
wherefrom
he
stole
but
his
we
can
not
find
we
have
handled
him
we
have
dandled
him
we
have
seared
him
to
the
bone
and
sure
if
tooth
and
nail
show
truth
he
has
no
soul
of
his
the
devil
he
bowed
his
head
on
his
breast
and
rumbled
deep
and
low
all
to
adam
breed
that
i
should
bid
him
go
yet
close
we
lie
and
deep
we
lie
and
if
i
gave
him
place
my
gentlemen
that
are
so
proud
would
flout
me
to
my
face
they
call
my
house
a
common
stews
and
me
a
careless
host
and
i
would
not
anger
my
gentlemen
for
the
sake
of
a
shiftless
the
devil
he
looked
at
the
mangled
soul
that
prayed
to
feel
the
flame
and
he
thought
of
holy
charity
but
he
thought
of
his
own
good
name
ye
could
haste
my
coal
to
waste
and
sit
ye
down
to
fry
did
ye
think
of
that
theft
for
yourself
said
he
and
tomlinson
said
the
devil
he
blew
an
outward
breath
for
his
heart
was
free
from
care
have
scarce
the
soul
of
a
louse
he
said
the
roots
of
sin
are
there
and
for
that
sin
should
ye
come
in
were
i
the
lord
alone
but
sinful
pride
has
rule
inside
and
mightier
than
my
own
honour
and
wit
they
sit
to
each
his
priest
and
whore
nay
scarce
i
dare
myself
go
there
and
you
they
torture
sore
ye
are
neither
spirit
nor
spirk
he
said
are
neither
book
nor
brute
go
get
ye
back
to
the
flesh
again
for
the
sake
of
man
repute
i
all
to
adam
breed
that
i
should
mock
your
pain
but
look
that
ye
win
to
worthier
sin
ere
ye
come
back
again
get
hence
the
hearse
is
at
your
door
the
grim
black
stallions
wait
they
bear
your
clay
to
place
speed
lest
ye
come
too
late
go
back
to
earth
with
a
lip
unsealed
go
back
with
an
open
eye
and
carry
my
word
to
the
sons
of
men
or
ever
ye
come
to
die
that
the
sin
they
do
by
two
and
two
they
must
pay
for
one
by
one
god

the
song

pull
out

ha
done
with
the
tents
of
shem
dear
lass

all

or
west
to

the
wildest
tales
are
true

the
days
are
sick
and
cold
and
the
skies
are
gray
and
old
and
the
airs
blow
damp
and
i
sell
my
tired
soul
for
the
bucking
roll
of
a
black
bilbao
tramp
with
her
over
her
hatch
dear
lass
and
a
drunken
dago
crew
and
her
nose
held
down

the
trail
that

there
be
triple
ways
to
take
of
the
eagle
or
the
snake
or
the
way
of
a
man
with
a
maid
but
the
fairest
way
to
me
is
a
ship
upon
the
sea
in
the
heel
of
the
trade
can
you
hear
the
crash
on
her
bows
dear
lass
and
the
drum
of
the
racing
screw
as
she
ships
it
green
on
the

trail
our
own

the
out
trail
as
she
lifts

on
the
long
trail
the

the

funnels
roar
with
the
peter
at
the
fore
and
the

heave
and
the
derricks
clack

hooks
the

the

the
mutter
overside
when
the
holds
us
tied
and
the
sirens
hoot
their
dread
when
foot
by
foot
we
creep
the
hueless
viewless
deep
to
the
sob
of
the
questing
lead
it
down
by
the

tropic
night
when
the

a
welt
of
light
that
holds
the
hot
sky
tame

the
steady
snores
through
the
floors
where
the

flukes

her
plates

sagging
south
on

home
get
her
home
where
the
drunken
rollers
comb
and
the

seas
drive
by
and

forward
o
my
heart
from
the
foreland
to
the
start
we
steaming
slow
and
it
twenty
thousand
mile
to
our
little
lazy
isle
where
the
blow
you
have
heard
the
call
of
the
wind
and
the
voice
of
the
rain
you
have
heard
the
song
how
long
how
long
pull
out
on
the
trail
again
the
lord
knows
what
we
may
find
dear
lass
and
the
deuce
knows
what
we
may
do
but
we
back
once
more
on
the
old
trail
our
own
trail
the
out
trail
we
down
hull
down
on
the
long
trail
the
trail
that
is
always
new
the
seven
seas
dedication
to
the
city
of
bombay
the
cities
are
full
of
pride
challenging
each
to
each
this
from
her
that
from
her
burthened
beach
they
count
their
ships
full
tale
their
corn
and
oil
and
wine
derrick
and
loom
and
bale
and
rampart
line
city
by
city
they
hail
aught
to
match
with
mine
and
the
men
that
breed
from
them
they
traffic
up
and
down
but
cling
to
their
cities
hem
as
a
child
to
their
mother
gown
when
they
talk
with
the
stranger
bands
dazed
and
newly
alone
when
they
walk
in
the
stranger
lands
by
roaring
streets
unknown
blessing
her
where
she
stands
for
strength
above
their
own
on
high
to
hold
her
fame
that
stands
all
fame
beyond
by
oath
to
back
the

her

so
thank
i
god
my
birth
fell
not
in
isles
aside
waste
headlands
of
the
earth
or
warring
tribes
untried
but
that
she
lent
me
worth
and
gave
me
right
to
pride
surely
in
toil
or
fray
under
an
alien
sky
comfort
it
is
to
say
no
mean
city
am
i
neither
by
service
nor
fee
come
i
to
mine
estate
mother
of
cities
to
me
for
i
was
born
in
her
gate
between
the
palms
and
the
sea
where
the
steamers
wait
now
for
this
debt
i
owe
and
for
her
cheer
must
i
make
haste
and
go
with
tribute
to
her
pier
and
she
shall
touch
and
remit
after
the
use
of
kings
orderly
ancient
fit
my
plunderings
and
purchase
in
all
lands
and
this
we
do
for
a
sign
her
power
is
over
mine
and
mine
i
hold
at
her
hands
the
seven
seas
a
song
of
the
english
fair
is
our
lot
o
goodly
is
our
heritage
humble
ye
my
people
and
be
fearful
in
your
mirth
for
the
lord
our
god
most
high
he
hath
made
the
deep
as
dry
he
hath
smote
for
us
a
pathway
to
the
ends
of
all
the
earth
yea
though
we
sinned
and
our
rulers
went
from
righteousness
deep
in
all
dishonour
though
we
stained
our
garments
hem
oh
be
ye
not
dismayed
though
we
stumbled
and
we
strayed
we
were
led
by
evil
counsellors
the
lord
shall
deal
with
them
hold
ye
the
faith
the
faith
our
fathers
seal
us
whoring
not
with
visions
overwise
and
overstale
except
ye
pay
the
lord
single
heart
and
single
sword
of
your
children
in
their
bondage
shall
he
ask
them
keep
ye

a

failed

dried
in

we
lay
down

draw
now
the

knot
firm

the

that

ye
speak

they
must

you
after

men
in

of

the
first
chantey
mine
was
the
woman
to
me
darkling
i
found
her
haling
her
dumb
from
the
camp
took
her
and
bound
her
hot
rose
her
tribe
on
our
track
ere
i
had
proved
her
hearing
her
laugh
in
the
gloom
greatly
i
loved
her
swift
through
the
forest
we
ran
none
stood
to
guard
us
few
were
my
people
and
far
then
the
flood
barred
us
him
we
call
son
of
the
sea
sullen
and
swollen
panting
we
waited
the
death
stealer
and
stolen
yet
ere
they
came
to
my
lance
laid
for
the
slaughter
lightly
she
leaped
to
a
log
lapped
in
the
water
holding
on
high
and
apart
skins
that
arrayed
her
called
she
the
god
of
the
wind
that
he
should
aid
her
life
had
the
tree
at
that
word
praise
we
the
giver
left
he
the
bank
for
the
full
river
far
fell
their
axes
behind
flashing
and
ringing
wonder
was
on
me
and
fear
yet
she
was
singing
low
lay
the
land
we
had
left
now
the
blue
bound
us
even
the
floor
of
the
gods
level
around
us
whisper
there
was
not
nor
word
shadow
nor
showing
till
the
light
stirred
on
the
deep
glowing
and
growing
then
did
he
leap
to
his
place
flaring
from
under
he
the
compeller
the
sun
bared
to
our
wonder
nay
not
a
league
from
our
eyes
blinded
with
gazing
cleared
he
the
gate
of
the
world
huge
and
amazing
this
we
beheld
and
we
live
the
pit
of
the
burning
then
the
god
spoke
to
the
tree
for
our
returning
back
to
the
beach
of
our
flight
fearless
and
slowly
back
to
our
slayers
went
he
but
we
were
holy
men
that
were
hot
in
that
hunt
women
that
followed
babes
that
were
promised
our
bones
trembled
and
wallowed
over
the
necks
of
the
tribe
crouching
and
fawning
prophet
and
priestess
we
came
back
from
the
dawning
the
last
chantey
there
was
no
more
thus
said
the
lord
in
the
vault
above
the
cherubim
calling
to
the
angels
and
the
souls
in
their
degree
earth
has
passed
away
on
the
smoke
of
judgment
day
that
our
word
may
be
established
shall
we
gather
up
the
sea
loud
sang
the
souls
of
the
jolly
jolly
mariners
upon
the
hurricane
that
made
us
furl
and
flee
but
the
war
is
done
between
us
in
the
deep
the
lord
hath
seen
us
our
bones
we
leave
the
barracout
and
god
may
sink
the
sea
then
said
the
soul
of
judas
that
betray
him
hast
thou
forgotten
thy
covenant
with
me
how
once
a
year
i
go
to
cool
me
on
the
floe
and
ye
take
my
day
of
mercy
if
ye
take
away
the
sea
then
said
the
soul
of
the
angel
of
the
wind
he
that
bits
the
thunder
when
the
breakers
flee
have
watch
and
ward
to
keep
thy
wonders
on
the
deep
and
ye
take
mine
honour
from
me
if
ye
take
away
the
sea
loud
sang
the
souls
of
the
jolly
jolly
mariners
but
we
were
angry
and
a
hasty
folk
are
we
if
we
worked
the
ship
together
till
she
foundered
in
foul
weather
are
we
babes
that
we
should
clamour
for
a
vengeance
on
the
sea
then
said
the
souls
of
the
slaves
that
men
threw
overboard
in
the
picaroon
a
weary
band
were
we
but
thy
arm
was
strong
to
save
and
it
touched
us
on
the
wave
and
we
drowsed
the
long
tides
idle
till
thy
trumpets
tore
the
then
cried
the
soul
of
the
stout
apostle
paul
to
god
we
frapped
a
ship
and
she
laboured
woundily
there
were
fourteen
score
of
these
and
they
blessed
thee
on
their
knees
when
they
learned
thy
grace
and
glory
under
malta
by
the
sea
loud
sang
the
souls
of
the
jolly
jolly
mariners
plucking
at
their
harps
and
they
plucked
unhandily
thumbs
are
rough
and
tarred
and
the
tune
is
something
hard
may
we
lift
a
chantey
such
as
seamen
use
at
sea
then
said
the
souls
of
the
fettered
wrist
to
bar
all
for
red
iniquity
we
revel
in
our
chains
the
sorrow
that

that

of

the

ye

loud
sang
the

jolly

crying

must
we
sing
for

on

glassy
floor
take
back
your

fiddles
and
we
beat
to

then
stooped
the

and
he
called
the

up

and
his

unto

that
such
as

shall

of

heard

gave

back
their

drew

back

that
the

we
bring
no

of
ingots
of

that
we

we
gathered
with

and
aching
bones
in
flame
beneath
the
tropics
in
frost
upon
the
floe
and
jeopardy
of
every
wind
that
does
between

go
and
some
we
got
by
purchase
and
some
we
had
by
trade
and
some
we
found
by
courtesy
of
pike
and
carronade
at
midnight
meetings
for
charity
to
keep
and
light
the
rolling
that
rode
a
foot
too
deep
by

of
bitter
weather
we
walty
strained
and
scarred
from
the

on

kelson
to

slings
upon

six
oceans
had
their
will
of
us
to
carry
all
away
our
galley
in
the
baltic
and
our
boom
in
mossel
bay
we
floundered
off
the
texel
awash
with
sodden
deals
we
slipped
from
valparaiso
with
the
norther
at
our
heels
we
ratched
beyond
the
crossets
that
tusk
the
southern
pole
and
dipped
our
gunnels
under
to
the
dread
agulhas
roll
beyond

we
sailed
where
none
have
sailed
and
saw
the
burning
on

none

stood
up
for

but
when
the
night
was
done
there
danced
the
deep
to
windward
the
sun
strange
consorts
rode
beside
us
and
brought
us
evil
luck
the
climbed
our
channels
and
flared
on
vane
and
truck
till
through
the
red
tornado
that
lashed
us
nigh
to
blind
we
saw
the
dutchman
plunging
full
canvas
head
to
wind
we
heard
the
midnight
leadsman
that
calls
the
black
deep
down
ay
thrice
we
heard
the
swimmer
the
thing
that
may
not
drown
on
frozen
bunt
and
gasket
the
drave
her
hosts
when
manned
by
more
than
signed
with
us
we
passed
the
isle
o
ghosts
and
north
amid
the
hummocks
a
below
we
met
the
silent
shallop
that
frighted
whalers
know
for
down
a
cruel
that
opened
as
he
sped
we
saw
dead
henry
hudson
steer
north
by

his

so
dealt
god
waters
with
us
beneath
the
roaring
skies
so
walked
his
signs
and
marvels
all
naked
to
our
eyes
but
we
were
heading
homeward
with
trade
to
lose
or
make

they
slipped
behind
us
in

of

now
shamed
at

fools
were
we
and
blind
the

we
stored
with

the

we
left
behind
round

i

the

at

the

ere
my

reached
its

had
flashed
my

the

earth
sold
her
chosen
men
of

they
lived

strove
and
died
for

my

toss

i
snatched
their

their

flew

i
tired
twenty

bade
them

i
sent
the

forth
to

where
hour
by

she
waited
me
among
ten
million
one
was
she
and
surely
all
men
hated
me
dawn
ran
to
meet
me
at
my

ah
day
no

tell

and
little

chattering
through

tell

tale
anew
of
a
hidden
sea
and
a
hidden
fight
when
the
ran
from

and
the
fought
the
two
now
this
is
the
law
of
the
muscovite
that
he
proves
with
shot
and
steel
when
ye
come
by
his
isles
in
the
smoky
sea
ye
must
not
take
the
seal
where
the
gray
sea
goes
nakedly
between
the
shelves
and
the
little
blue
fox
he
is
bred
for
his
skin
and
the
seal
they
breed
for
themselves
for
when
the
seek
the
shore
to
drop
their
pups
aland
the
great
haul
out
of
the
sea
band
by
band
and
when
the
first
september
gales
have
slaked
their
the
great
haul
back
to
the
sea
and
no
man
knows
their
path
then
dark
they
lie
and
stark
they
lie
rookery
dune
and
floe
and
the
northern
lights
come
down
o
nights
to
dance
with
the
houseless
snow
and
god
who
clears
the
grounding
berg
and
steers
the
grinding
floe
he
hears
the
cry
of
the
little
and
the
wind
along
the
snow
but
since
our
women
must
walk
gay
and
money
buys
their

the
they
filch

way

english
they

and
some

but
the
worst
of
the
lot
and
the
boldest
thieves
be
yank
it
was
the
sealer
to
the
smoky
seas
she
bore
with
a
stovepipe
stuck
from
a
starboard
port
and
the
russian
flag
at
her
fore
and
oh
they
were
birds
of
a
feather
slipping
away
to
the
smoky
seas
three
together
and
at
last
she
came
to
a
sandy
cove
and
the
baltic
lay
therein
but
her
men
were
up
with
the
herding
seal
to
drive
and
club
and
skin
there
were
fifteen
hundred
skins
abeach
cool
pelt
and
proper
fur
when
the
drove
into
the
bight
and
the
drove
with
her
the
called
her
men
and
weighed
she
could
not
choose
but
run
for
a
stovepipe
seen
through
the
closing
mist
it
shows
like
a
gun
and
loss
it
is
that
is
sad
as
death
to
lose
both
trip
and
ship
and
lie
for
a
rotting
contraband
on
vladivostock
slip
she
turned
and
dived
in
the
as
a
rabbit
dives
in
the
whins
and
the
sent
up
her
boats
to
steal
the
stolen
skins
they
had
not
brought
a
load
to
side
or
slid
their
hatches
clear
when
they
were
aware
of
a
and
very
near
her
flag
she
showed
and
her
guns
she
showed
three
of
them
black
abeam
and
a
funnel
white
with
the
crusted
salt
but
never
a
show
of
steam
there
was
no
time
to
man
the
brakes
they
knocked
the
shackle
free
and
the
stood
out
again
to
open
sea
for
life
it
is
that
is
worse
than
death
by
force
of
russian
law
to
work
in
the
mines
of
mercury
that
loose
the
teeth
in
your
jaw
they
had
not
run
a
mile
from
shore
they
heard
no
shots
behind
when
the
skipper
smote
his
hand
on
his
thigh
and
threw
her
up
in
the
wind
raised
out
on
a
bluff
said
he
if
my
name
tom
hall
you
must
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
and
a
thief
has
caught
us
all
by
every
butt
in
oregon
and
every
spar
in
maine
the
hand
that
spilled
the
wind
from
her
sail
was
the
hand
of
reuben
paine
he
has
rigged
and
trigged
her
with
paint
and
spar
and
faith
he
has
faked
her
well
but
i
know
the
deckhouse
yet
from
here
to
the
booms
o
hell
oh
once
we
ha
met
at
baltimore
and
twice
on
boston
pier
but
the
sickest
day
for
you
reuben
paine
was
the
day
that
you
came
here
the
day
that
you
came
here
my
lad
to
scare
us
from
our
seal
with
your
funnel
made
o
your
painted
cloth
and
your
guns
o
rotten
deal
ring
and
blow
for
the
now
and
head
her
back
to
the
bay
and
we
come
into
the
game
again
with
a
double
deck
to
play
they
rang
and
blew
the
sealers
call
the
poaching
cry
of
the
sea
and
they
raised
the
out
of
the
mist
and
an
angry
ship
was
she
and
blind
they
groped
through
the
whirling
white
and
blind
to
the
bay
again
till
they
heard
the
creak
of
the
boom
and
the
clank
of
her
mooring
chain
they
laid
them
down
by
bitt
and
boat
their
pistols
in
their
belts
and
you
fight
for
it
reuben
paine
or
will
you
share
the
pelts
a
laugh
laughed
reuben
paine
and
bared
his
skin
for
skin
and
all
that
he
hath
a
man
will
give
for
his
life
but
i
six
thousand
skins
below
and
yeddo
port
to
see
and
there
never
a
law
of
god
or
man
runs
north
of
so
go
in
peace
to
the
naked
seas
with
empty
holds
to
fill
and
i
be
good
to
your
seal
this
catch
as
many
as
i
shall
kill
answered
the
snap
of
a
closing
lock
and
the
jar
of
a
slid
but
the
tender
fog
shut
fold
on
fold
to
hide
the
wrong
they
did
the
weeping
fog
rolled
fold
on
fold
the
wrath
of
man
to
cloak
and
the
pale
ran
down
the
rail
as
the
spoke
the
bullets
bit
on
bend
and
butt
the
splinter
slivered
free
little
they
trust
to
that
stop
the
seal
in
his
sea
the
thick
smoke
hung
and
would
not
shift
leaden
it
lay
and
blue
but
three
were
down
on
the
deck
and
two
of
the
crew
an
out
and
overside
the
banked
fog
held
them
bound
but
as
they
heard
or
groan
or
word
they
fired
at
the
sound
for
one
cried
out
on
the
name
of
god
and
one
to
have
him
cease
and
the
questing
volley
found
them
both
and
bade
them
hold
their
peace
and
one
called
out
on
a
heathen
joss
and
one
on
the
virgin
name
and
the
schooling
bullet
leaped
across
and
showed
them
whence
they
came
and
in
the
waiting
silences
the
rudder
whined
beneath
and
each
man
drew
his
watchful
breath
slow
taken
the
teeth
trigger
and
ear
and
eye
acock
knit
brow
and
lips
bracing
his
feet
by
chock
and
cleat
for
the
rolling
of
the
ships
till
they
heard
the
cough
of
a
wounded
man
that
fought
in
the
fog
for
breath
till
they
heard
the
torment
of
reuben
paine
that
wailed
upon
his
death
tides
they
go
through
fundy
race
but
i
go
nevermore
and
see
the
hogs
from
mark
turn
scampering
back
to
shore
no
more
i
see
the
trawlers
drift
below
the
bass
rock
ground
or
watch
the
tall
fall
steamer
lights
tear
blazing
up
the
sound
sorrow
is
me
in
a
lonely
sea
and
a
sinful
fight
i
fall
but
if

tom

and
he
hit
tom

with
a
bursting
ball
a
over

by

and
sat
him
down
with

the
devil

up
to
the
wrath
of

as
the
holluschickie

put
back
your

and
lay
your

but
thick
and
quick
and
loud
the
drummed
on
the
dripping
decks
with
the
from
the
shroud
the
drew
them
side
by
side
gunnel
to
gunnel
laid
and
they
felt
the
sheerstrakes
pound
and
clear
but
never
a
word
was
said
then
reuben
paine
cried
out
again
before
his
spirit
passed
i
followed
the
sea
for
thirty
years
to
die
in
the
dark
at
last
curse
on
her
work
that
has
nipped
me
here
with
a
shifty
trick
unkind
i
have
gotten
my
death
where
i
got
my
bread
but
i
dare
not
face
it
blind
curse
on
the
fog
is
there
never
a
wind
of
all
the
winds
i
knew
to
clear
the
smother
from
off
my
chest
and
let
me
look
at
the
blue
the
good
fog
heard
like
a
splitten
sail
to
left
and
right
she
tore
and
they
saw
the
in
the
haze
and
the
seal
upon
the
shore
silver
and
gray
ran
spit
and
bay
to
meet
the
tide
and
pinched
and
white
in
the
clearing
light
the
crews
stared
overside
o
the
red
pools
lay
that
swilled
and
spilled
and
spread
and
gold
raw
gold
the
spent
shell
rolled
between
the
careless
dead
the
dead
that
rocked
so
drunkenwise
to
weather
and
to
lee
and
they
saw
the
work
their
hands
had
done
as
god
had
bade
them
see
and
a
little
breeze
blew
over
the
rail
that
made
the
headsails
lift
but
no
man
stood
by
wheel
or
sheet
and
they
let
the
schooners
drift
and
the
rattle
rose
in
reuben
throat
and
he
cast
his
soul
with
a
cry
and
already
tom
hall
he
said
it
time
for
me
to
his
eyes
were
heavy
with
great
sleep
and
yearning
for
the
land
and
he
spoke
as
a
man
that
talks
in
dreams
his
wound
beneath
his
hand
there
comes
no
good
o
the
westering
wind
that
backs
against
the
sun
wash
down
the
decks
they
all
too
red
and
share
the
skins
and
run
and
clean
share
and
share
for
all
you
find
the
fleets
off
tolstoi
mees
but
you
will
not
find
tom
hall
evil
he
did
in
and
blacker
sin
on
the
deep
but
now
he
sick
of
watch
and
trick
and
now
he
turn
and
sleep
he
have
no
more
of
the
crawling
sea
that
made
him
suffer
so
but
he
lie
down
on
the
where
the
holluschickie
go
and
west
you
sail
and
south
again
beyond
the
rim
and
tell
the
yoshiwara
girls
to
burn
a
stick
for
him
and
you
not
weight
him
by
the
heels
and
dump
him
overside
but
carry
him
up
to
the
to
die
as
bering
died
and
make
a
place
for
reuben
paine
that
knows
the
fight
was
fair
and
leave
the
two
that
did
the
wrong
to
talk
it
over
there
ahead
by
guess
and
lead
for
the
sun
is
mostly
veiled
through
fog
to
fog
by
luck
and
log
sail
ye
as
bering
sailed
and
if
the
light
shall
lift
aright
to
give
your
landfall
plain
north
and
by
west
from
zapne
crest
ye
raise
the
crosses
twain
fair
marks
are
they
to
the
inner
bay
the
reckless
poacher
knows
what
time
the
scarred
lead
their
sleek
seraglios
ever
they
hear
the
clear
and
the
blast
of
the
old
and
the
deep
that
beats
above
the
loudest
gale
ever
they
wait
the
winter
hate
as
the
thundering
calls
where
northward
look
they
to
george
and
westward
to
paul
ever
they
greet
the
hunted
fleet
lone
keels
off
headlands
drear
when
the
flit
that
way
at
hazard
year
by
year
ever
in
yokohama
port
men
tell
the
tale
anew
of
a
hidden
sea
and
a
hidden
fight
when
the
ran
from
the
and
the
fought
the
two
the
derelict
reports
the
derelict
still
at
shipping
news
i
was
the
staunchest
of
our
fleet
till
the
sea
rose
beneath
our
feet
unheralded
in
hatred
past
all
measure
into
his
pits
he
stamped
my
crew
buffeted
blinded
bound
and
threw
bidding
me
eyeless
wait
upon
his
pleasure
man
made
me
and
my
will
is
to
my
maker
still
whom
now
the
currents
con
the
rollers
steer
lifting
forlorn
to
spy
trailed
smoke
along
the
sky
falling
afraid
lest
any
keel
come
near
wrenched
as
the
lips
of
thirst
wried
dried
and
split
and
burst
my
decks
to
the
graining
and
jarred
at
every
roll
the
gear
that
was
my
soul
answers
the
anguish
of
my
beams
complaining
for
life
that
crammed
me
full
gangs
of
the
prying
gull
that
shriek
and
scrabble
on
the
riven
hatches
for
roar
that
dumbed
the
gale
my
guttering
wail
sobbing
my
heart
out
through
the
uncounted
watches
blind
in
the
hot
blue
ring
through
all
my
points
i
swing
swing
and
return
to
shift
the
sun
anew
blind
in
my
sky
i
hear
the
stars
go
by
mocking
the
prow
that
can
not
hold
one
true
white
on
my
wasted
path
wave
after
wave
in
wrath
frets
his
fellow
warring
where
to
send
me
flung
forward
heaved
aside
witless
and
dazed
i
bide
the
mercy
of
the
comber
that
shall
end
me
north
where
the
bergs
careen
the
spray
of
seas
unseen
smokes
round
my
head
and
freezes
in
the
falling
south
where
the
corals
breed
the
footless
floating
weed
folds
me
and
fouls
me
strake
on
strake
upcrawling
i
that
was
clean
to
run
my
race
against
the
sun
strength
on
the
deep
am
bawd
to
all
disaster
whipped
forth
by
night
to
meet
my
sister
careless
feet
and
with
a
kiss
betray
her
to
my
master
man
made
me
and
my
will
is
to
my
maker
still
to
him
and
his
our
peoples
at
their
pier
lifting
in
hope
to
spy
trailed
smoke
along
the
sky
falling
afraid
lest
any
keel
come
near
the
answer
a
rose
in
tatters
on
the
garden
path
cried
out
to
god
and
murmured
his
wrath
because
a
sudden
wind
at
twilight
hush
had
snapped
her
stem
alone
of
all
the
bush
and
god
who
hears
both
dust
and
sun
had
pity
whispering
to
that
luckless
one
in
that
thou
sayest
we
did
not
well
what
voices
heardst
thou
when
thy
petals
fell
and
the
rose
answered
that
evil
hour
a
voice
said
wherefore
falls
the
flower
for
lo
the
very
gossamers
are
still
and
a
voice
answered
by
allah
will
then
softly
as
a
on
the
sward
came
to
the
rose
the
answer
of
the
lord
before
we
smote
the
dark
in
twain
ere
yet
the
stars
saw
one
another
plain
time
tide
and
space
we
bound
unto
the
task
that
thou
shouldst
fall
and
such
an
one
should
whereat
the
withered
flower
all
content
died
as
they
die
whose
days
are
innocent
while
he
who
questioned
why
the
flower
fell
caught
hold
of
god
and
saved
his
soul
from
hell
the
song
of
the
banjo
you
could
pack
a
broadwood
half
a
mile
you
must
leave
a
fiddle
in
the
damp
you
could
raft
an
organ
up
the
nile
and
play
it
in
an
equatorial
swamp
travel
with
the
and
pails
sandwiched
the
coffee
and
the
pork
and
when
the
dusty
column
checks
and
tails
you
should
hear
me
spur
the
to
a
walk
with
my
popp
oh
it
any
tune
that
comes
into
my
head
so
i
keep
moving
forward
till
they
drop
so
i
play
up
to
water
and
to
bed
in
the
silence
of
the
camp
before
the
fight
when
it
good
to
make
your
will
and
say
your
prayer
you
can
hear
my
overnight
explaining
ten
to
one
was
always
fair
i
the
prophet
of
the
utterly
absurd
of
the
patently
impossible
and
vain
and
when
the
thing
that
could
has
occurred
give
me
time
to
change
my
leg
and
go
again
with
my
tump
in
the
desert
where
the
curled
there
was
never
voice
before
us
till
i
led
our
lonely
chorus
i
the
of
the
white
man
round
the
world
by
the
bitter
road
the
younger
son
must
tread
ere
he
win
to
hearth
and
saddle
of
his
own
the
riot
of
the
shearers
at
the
shed
in
the
silence
of
the
herder
hut
alone
in
the
twilight
on
a
bucket
upside
down
hear
me
babble
what
the
weakest
wo
confess
i
am
memory
and
torment
i
am
town
i
am
all
that
ever
went
with
evening
dress
with
my
so
the
lights
the
london
lights
grow
near
and
plain
so
i
rowel
afresh
towards
the
devil
and
the
flesh
till
i
bring
my
broken
rankers
home
again
in
desire
of
many
marvels
over
sea
where
the
tropic
city
sweats
and
roars
i
have
sailed
with
young
ulysses
from
the
quay
till
the
anchor
rumbled
down
on
stranger
shores
he
is
blooded
to
the
open
and
the
sky
he
is
taken
in
a
snare
that
shall
not
fail
he
shall
hear
me
singing
strongly
till
he
die
like
the
shouting
of
a
backstay
in
a
gale
with
my
heeya
heeya
hullah
haul
o
the
green
that
thunders
aft
along
the
deck
are
you
sick
o
towns
and
men
you
must
sign
and
sail
again
for
it
bowlegs
pack
your
kit
and
trek
through
the
gorge
that
gives
the
stars
at
clear
up
the
pass
that
packs
the
scud
beneath
our
wheel
round
the
bluff
that
sinks
her
thousand
fathom
sheer
down
the
valley
with
our
guttering
brakes
asqueal
where
the
trestle
groans
and
quivers
in
the
snow
where
the
levels
loop
and
twine
so
i
lead
my
reckless
children
from
below
till
we
sing
the
song
of
roland
to
the
pine
with
my
and
the
axe
has
cleared
the
mountain
croup
and
crest
so
we
ride
the
iron
stallions
down
to
drink
through
the
canyons
to
the
waters
of
the
west
and
the
tunes
that
mean
so
much
to
you
alone
common
tunes
that
make
you
choke
and
blow
your
nose
vulgar
tunes
that
bring
the
laugh
that
brings
the
groan
i
can
rip
your
very
heartstrings
out
with
those
with
the
feasting
and
the
folly
and
the
fun
and
the
lying
and
the
lusting
and
the
drink
and
the
merry
play
that
drops
you
when
you
done
to
the
thoughts
that
burn
like
irons
if
you
think
with
my
here
a
trifle
on
account
of
pleasure
past
ere
the
wit
that
made
you
win
gives
you
eyes
to
see
your
sin
and
the
heavier
repentance
at
the
last
let
the
organ
moan
her
sorrow
to
the
roof
i
have
told
the
naked
stars
the
grief
of
man
let
the
trumpets
snare
the
foeman
to
the
proof
i
have
known
defeat
and
mocked
it
as
we
ran
my
bray
ye
may
not
alter
nor
mistake
when
i
stand
to
jeer
the
fatted
soul
of
things
but
the
song
of
lost
endeavour
that
i
make
is
it
hidden
in
the
twanging
of
the
strings
with
my
is
it
naught
to
you
that
hear
and
pass
me
by
but
the
word
the
word
is
mine
when
the
order
moves
the
line
and
the
lean
locked
ranks
go
roaring
down
to
die
of
the
driven
dust
of
speech
i
make
a
flame
and
a
scourge
of
broken
withes
that
men
let
fall
for
the
words
that
had
no
honour
till
i
came
lo
i
raise
them
into
honour
over
all
by
the
wisdom
of
the
centuries
i
speak
to
the
tune
of
yestermorn
i
set
the
truth
i
the
joy
of
life
unquestioned
i
the
greek
i
the
everlasting
wonder
song
of
youth
with
my
what

lack

noble
masters

on
the
sea
an
the
pens
broke
up
on
the
lower
deck
an
let
the
creatures
free
an
the
lights
went
out
on
the
lower
deck
an
no
one
near
but
me
i
had
been
singin
to
them
to
keep
quiet
there
for
the
lower
deck
is
the
dangerousest
requirin
constant
care
an
give
to
me
as
the
strongest
man
though
used
to
drink
and
swear
i
see
my
chance
was
certain
of
bein
horned
or
trod
for
the
lower
deck
was
packed
with
steers
peas
in
a
pod
an
more
pens
broke
at
every
roll
so
i
made
a
contract
with
god
an
by
the
terms
of
the
contract
as
i
have
read
the
same
if
he
got
me
to
port
alive
i
would
exalt
his
name
an
praise
his
holy
majesty
till
further
orders
came
he
saved
me
from
the
cattle
an
he
saved
me
from
the
sea
for
they
found
me
two
drownded
ones
where
the
roll
had
landed
me
an
a
crack
on
top
of
my
head
as
crazy
as
could
be
but
that
were
done
by
a
stanchion
an
not
by
a
bullock
at
all
an
i
lay
still
for
seven
weeks
convalessing
of
the
fall
an
readin
the
shiny
scripture
texts
in
the
seaman
hospital
an
i
spoke
to
god
of
our
contract
an
he
says
to
my
prayer
never
puts
on
my
ministers
no
more
than
they
can
bear
so
back
you
go
to
the
an
preach
my
gospel
there
human
life
is
chancy
at
any
kind
of
trade
but
most
of
all
as
well
you
know
when
the
steers
are
so
you
go
back
to
the
an
preach
as
i
said
must
quit
drinkin
an
swearin
they
must
knife
on
a
blow
they
must
quit
gamblin
their
wages
and
you
must
preach
it
so
for
now
those
boats
are
more
like
hell
than
anything
else

i
did
want
to
do
it
for
i
knew
what
i
should
get
an
i
wanted
to
preach

an
out
of
the

smit
an
bruis
as
warned
would
be
the
case
an

my
cheek
to
the
smiter

following
that
i
knocked
him
down
an
led
him
up
to
grace
an
we
have
preaching
on
sundays
whenever
the
sea
is
calm
an
i
use
no
knife
or
pistol
an
i
never
take
no
harm
for
the
lord
abideth
back
of
me
to
guide
my
fighting
arm
an
i
sign
for
a
month
and

the
money

in
charge
of
the
lower
deck
an
i

at

the
lost
legion
there
a
legion
that
never
was
that
carries
no
colours
or
crest
but
split
in
a
thousand
detachments
is
breaking
the
road
for
the
rest
our
fathers
they
left
us
their
blessing
they
taught
us
and
groomed
us
and
crammed
but
we
shaken
the
clubs
and
the
messes
to
go
and
find
out
and
be
damned
dear
boys
to
go
and
get
shot
and
be
damned
so
some
of
us
chivy
the
slaver
and
some
of
us
cherish
the
black
and
some
of
us
hunt
on
the
oil
coast
and
some
on
the
wallaby
track
and
some
of
us
drift
to
sarawak
and
some
of
us
drift
up
the
fly
and
some
share
our
tucker
with
tigers
and
some
with
the
gentle
masai
dear
boys
take
tea
with
the
giddy
masai
we
painted
the
islands
vermilion
we
pearled
on
in
the
bay
we
shouted
on
nuggets
we
starved
on
a
seedeeboy
pay
we
laughed
at
the
world
as
we
found
it
its
women
and
cities
and
men
from
sayyid
burgash
in
a
tantrum
to
the
eyes
of
loben
dear
boys
we
a
little
account
with
loben
the
ends
o
the
earth
were
our
portion
the
ocean
at
large
was
our
share
there
was
never
a
skirmish
to
windward
but
the
leaderless
legion
was
there
yes
somehow
and
somewhere
and
always
we
were
first
when
the
trouble
began
from
a
in
manila
to
an
race
on
the
pan
dear
boys
with
the
mounted
police
on
the
pan
we
preach
in
advance
of
the
army
we
skirmish
ahead
of
the
church
with
never
a
gunboat
to
help
us
when
we
scuppered
and
left
in
the
lurch
but
we
know
as
the
cartridges
finish
and
we
filed
on
our
last
little
shelves
that
the
legion
that
never
was
will
send
us
as
good
as
ourselves
good
men
five
hundred
as
good
as
ourselves
then
a
health
we
must
drink
it
in
whispers
to
our
wholly
unauthorised
horde
to
the
line
of
our
dusty
foreloopers
the
gentlemen
rovers
abroad
yes
a
health
to
ourselves
ere
we
scatter
for
the
steamer
wo
wait
for
the
train
and
the
legion
that
never
was
goes
back
into
quarters
again
goes
back
under
canvas
again
hurrah
the
swag
and
the
billy
again
here
how
the
trail
and
the
packhorse
again
salue
the
trek
and
the
laager
again
the
there
dwells
a
wife
by
the
northern
gate
and
a
wealthy
wife
is
she
she
breeds
a
breed
o
rovin
men
and
casts
them
over
sea
and
some
are
drowned
in
deep
water
and
some
in
sight
o
shore
and
word
goes
back
to
the
weary
wife
and
ever
she
sends
more
for
since
that
wife
had
gate
or
gear
or
hearth
or
garth
or
bield
she
willed
her
sons
to
the
white
harvest
and
that
is
a
bitter
yield
she
wills
her
sons
to
the
wet
ploughing
to
ride
the
horse
of
tree
and
syne
her
sons
come
back
again
from
out
the
sea
the
good
wife
sons
come
home
again
with
little
into
their
hands
but
the
lore
of
men
that
ha
dealt
with
men
in
the
new
and
naked
lands
but
the
faith
of
men
that
ha
brothered
men
by
more
than
easy
breath
and
the
eyes
o
men
that
ha
read
wi
men
in
the
open
books
of
death
rich
are
they
rich
in
wonders
seen
but
poor
in
the
goods
o
men
so
what
they
ha
got
by
the
skin
o
their
teeth
they
sell
for
their
teeth
again
for
whether
they
lose
to
the
naked
life
or
win
to
their
hearts
desire
they
tell
it
all
to
the
weary
wife
that
nods
beside
the
fire
her
hearth
is
wide
to
every
wind
that
makes
the
white
ash
spin
and
tide
and
tide
and
the
tides
her
sons
go
out
and
in
out
with
great
mirth
that
do
desire
hazard
of
trackless
ways
in
with
content
to
wait
their
watch
and
warm
before
the
blaze
and
some
return
by
failing
light
and
some
in
waking
dream
for
she
hears
the
heels
of
the
dripping
ghosts
that
ride
the
rough
home
they
come
home
from
all
the
ports
the
living
and
the
dead
the
good
wife
sons
come
home
again
for
her
blessing
on
their
head

the
earth
is
full
of

song

i
ha
harpit

down
to
the
hinges
o
hell
and
ye
would
make
a
knight
o
me
in
the
neolithic
age
in
the
neolithic
age
savage
warfare
did
i
wage
for
food
and
fame
and
woolly
horses
pelt
i
was
singer
to
my
clan
in
that
dim
red
dawn
of
man
and
i
sang
of
all
we
fought
and
feared
and
felt
yea
i
sang
as
now
i
sing
when
the
prehistoric
spring
made
the
piled
biscayan
split
and
shove
and
the
troll
and
gnome
and
dwerg
and
the
gods
of
cliff
and
berg
were
about
me
and
beneath
me
and
above
but
a
rival
of
solutr
told
the
tribe
my
style
was
a
tomahawk
of
diorite
he
fell
and
i
left
my
views
on
art
barbed
and
tanged
below
the
heart
of
a
mammothistic
etcher
at
grenelle
then
i
stripped
them
scalp
from
skull
and
my
hunting
dogs
fed
full
and
their
teeth
i
threaded
neatly
on
a
thong
and
i
wiped
my
mouth
and
said
is
well
that
they
are
dead
for
i
know
my
work
is
right
and
theirs
was
but
my
totem
saw
the
shame
from
his
ridgepole
shrine
he
came
and
he
told
me
in
a
vision
of
the
night
are
nine
and
sixty
ways
of
constructing
tribal
lays
and
every
single
one
of
them
is
right
then
the
silence
closed
upon
me
till
they
put
new
clothing
on
me
of
whiter
weaker
flesh
and
bone
more
frail
and
i
stepped
beneath
time
finger
once
again
a
tribal
singer
and
a
minor
poet
certified
by
tr
ll
still
they
skirmish
to
and
fro
men
my
messmates
on
the
snow
when
we
headed
off
the
aurochs
turn
for
turn
when
the
rich
allobrogenses
never
kept
amanuenses
and
our
only
plots
were
piled
in
lakes
at
berne
still
a
cultured
christian
age
sees
us
scuffle
squeak
and
rage
still
we
pinch
and
slap
and
jabber
scratch
and
dirk
still
we
let
our
business
slide
as
we
dropped
the
hide
to
show
a
how
to
work
still
the
world
is
wondrous
large
seven
seas
from
marge
to
marge
and
it
holds
a
vast
of
various
kinds
of
man
and
the
wildest
dreams
of
kew
are
the
facts
of
khatmandhu
and
the
crimes
of
clapham
chaste
in
martaban
here
my
wisdom
for
your
use
as
i
learned
it
when
the
moose
and
the
reindeer
roared
where
paris
roars
there
are
nine
and
sixty
ways
of
constructing
tribal
lays
and
every
single
one
of
them
is
right
the
story
of
ung
once
on
a
glittering
ages
and
ages
ago
ung
a
maker
of
pictures
fashioned
an
image
of
snow
fashioned
the
form
of
a
tribesman
gaily
he
whistled
and
sung
working
the
snow
with
his
fingers
ye
the
story
of
ung
pleased
was
his
tribe
with
that
image
came
in
their
hundreds
to
scan
handled
it
smelt
it
and
grunted
this
is
a
man
thus
do
we
carry
our
lances
thus
is
a
slung
lo
it
is
even
as
we
are
glory
and
honour
to
ung
later
he
pictured
an
aurochs
later
he
pictured
a
bear
pictured
the
tiger
dragging
a
man
to
his
lair
pictured
the
mountainous
mammoth
hairy
abhorrent
alone
out
of
the
love
that
he
bore
them
scribing
them
clearly
on
bone
swift
came
the
tribe
to
behold
them
peering
and
pushing
and
still
men
of
the
beaches
men
of
the
hill
hunters
and
fishers
and
trappers
presently
whispering
low
they
are
like
and
it
may
be
but
how
does
the
know
hath
he
slept
with
the
aurochs
watched
where
the
mastodon
roam
spoke
on
the
ice
with
the
followed
the
home
nay
these
are
toys
of
his
fancy
if
he
have
cheated
us
so
how
is
there
truth
in
his
image
the
man
that
he
fashioned
of
snow
wroth
was
that
maker
of
pictures
hotly
he
answered
the
call
and
fishers
and
trappers
children
and
fools
are
ye
all
look
at
the
beasts
when
ye
hunt
them
swift
from
the
tumult
he
broke
ran
to
the
cave
of
his
father
and
told
him
the
shame
that
they
spoke
and
the
father
of
ung
gave
answer
that
was
old
and
wise
in
the
craft
maker
of
pictures
aforetime
he
leaned
on
his
lance
and
laughed
they
could
see
as
thou
seest
they
would
do
what
thou
hast
done
and
each
man
would
make
him
a
picture
and
what
would
become
of
my
son
would
be
no
pelts
of
the
reindeer
flung
down
at
thy
cave
for
a
gift
nor
dole
of
the
oily
timber
that
comes
on
the
baltic
drift
no
store
of
needles
nor
ouches
of
amber
pale
no
tongues
of
the
bison
nor
meat
of
the
stranded
whale
hast
not
toiled
at
the
fishing
when
the
sodden
trammels
freeze
nor
worked
the
outward
through
the
rush
of
the
seas
yet
they
bring
thee
fish
and
plunder
full
meal
and
an
easy
bed
and
all
for
the
sake
of
thy
and
ung
held
down
his
head
hast
not
stood
to
the
aurochs
when
the
red
snow
reeks
of
the
fight
men
have
no
time
at
the
houghing
to
count
his
curls
aright
and
the
heart
of
the
hairy
mammoth
thou
sayest
they
do
not
see
yet
they
save
it
whole
from
the
beaches
and
broil
the
best
for
thee
now
do
they
press
to
thy
pictures
with
opened
mouth
and
eye
and
a
little
gift
in
the
doorway
and
the
praise
no
gift
can
buy
but
sure
they
have
doubted
thy
pictures
and
that
is
a
grievous
stain
son
that
can
see
so
clearly
return
them
their
gifts
again
and
ung
looked
down
at
his
deerskins
their
broad
bands
and
ung
drew
downward
his
mitten
and
looked
at
his
naked
hands
and
he
gloved
himself
and
departed
and
he
heard
his
father
behind
that
can
see
so
clearly
rejoice
that
thy
tribe
is
blind
straight
on
the
glittering
by
the
caves
of
the
lost
dordogne
ung
a
maker
of
pictures
fell
to
his
scribing
on
bone
even
to
mammoth
editions
gaily
he
whistled
and
sung
blessing
his
tribe
for
their
blindness
ye
the
story
of
ung
the
novel
is
full
thirty
foot
she
towered
from
waterline
to
rail
it
cost
a
watch
to
steer
her
and
a
week
to
shorten
sail
but
spite
all
modern
notions
i
found
her
first
and
best
the
only
certain
packet
for
the
islands
of
the

fair

the
breeze
behind
us
was
warm
with
lovers

we
stolen
wills
for
ballast
and
a
crew
of
missing
heirs
they
shipped
as
able
bastards
till
the
wicked
nurse
confessed
and
they
worked
the
old
to
the
islands
of
the
blest
by
ways
no
gaze
could
follow
a
course
unspoiled
of
cook
per
fancy
fleetest

titled
berths
we
took
with
maids
of
matchless
beauty
and
parentage
unguessed
and
a

for
the
islands
of

we
asked
no
social
questions
we
pumped
no

shame
we
never

when
the
little
stranger

we
left

us

when

i
went
ashore
at

i
left
all
in

on
the
decks
i
left
the
lovers
loving
and
the
parents
signing
cheques
in
endless
english
comfort
by
caressed
i
left
the
old
at
the
islands
of
the
blest
that
route
is
barred
to
steamers
you
never
lift
again
our
headlands
or
the
lordly
keeps
of
spain
they
just

so
far
you
cruise
in
a
liner
with
a
brace
of
bucking
screws
swing
round
your
aching

no

peace
ay
blow
your
shrieking
sirens
to
the
deaf
seas
boom
out
the
dripping
to

the
deep
unrest
and
you
are
one
knot
the
nearer
to
the
islands
of

when
you
threshing
crippled
with
broken
bridge
and
rail
at
a
drogue
of
dead
convictions
to
hold
you
head
to

calm
as
the
flying
dutchman
from

dressed
you
see
the
old
for
the
islands
of

you
see
her
tiering
canvas
in
sheeted
silver
spread
you
hear
the
thunder
her
leaping
while
far
so
far
above
you
her
tall
shine
unvexed
by
wind
or
weather
like
the
candles
round
a
shrine
hull
down
hull
down
and
under
she
dwindles
to
a
speck
with
noise
of
pleasant
music
and
dancing
on
her
deck
all
well
all
well
aboard
her
she
left
you
far
behind
with
a
scent
of
roses
through
the
fog
that
ties
you

her

her

is
all
to

by
truth
and

and
you

for
steaming
sake
well
tinker
up
your
engines
you
know
your
business
best
taking
tired
people
to
the
islands
of
the

an
american
the
american
spirit
speaks
the
led
striker
call
it
a
strike
or
the
papers
call
it
a
war
they
know
not
much
what
i
am
like
nor
what
he
is
my
through
many
roads
by
me
possessed
he
shambles
forth
in
cosmic
guise
he
is
the
jester
and
the
jest
and
he
the
text
himself
applies
the
celt
is
in
his
heart
and
hand
the
gaul
is
in
his
brain
and
nerve
where
cosmopolitanly
planned
he
guards
the
redskin
dry
reserve
his
easy
unswept
hearth
he
lends
from
labrador
to
guadeloupe
till
elbowed
out
by
sloven
friends
he
camps
at
sufferance
on
the
stoop
he
scoffs
at
sword
and
crown
or
stabs
and
slays
blatant
he
bids
the
world
bow
down
or
cringing
begs
a
crust
of
praise
or
at
mine
and
mart
he
dubs
his
dreary
brethren
kings
his
hands
are
black
with
blood
his
heart
leaps
as
a
babe
at
little
things
but
through
the
shift
of
mood
and
mood
mine
ancient
humour
saves
him
whole
the
cynic
devil
in
his
blood
that
bids
him
mock
his
hurrying
soul
that
bids
him
flout
the
law
he
makes
that
bids
him
make
the
law
he
flouts
till
dazed
by
many
doubts
he
wakes
the
drumming
guns
that
have
no
doubts
that
checks
him
foolish
hot
and
fond
that
chuckles
through
his
deepest
ire
that
gilds
the
slough
of
his
despond
but
dims
the
goal
of
his
desire
inopportune
the
acrid
asiatic
mirth
that
leaves
him
careless
his
dead
the
scandal
of
the
elder
earth
how
shall
he
clear
himself
how
reach
your
bar
or
weighed
defence
prefer
a
brother
hedged
with
alien
speech
and
lacking
all
interpreter
which
knowledge
vexes
him
a
space
but
while
reproof
around
him
rings
he
turns
a
keen
untroubled
face
home
to
the
instant
need
of
things
enslaved
illogical
elate

the
chances

calling
it
luck

what
boats
i
handled
rotten
and
leaky
and
old
ran
or
opened
the
precisely
as
i
was
told
grub
that
bind
you
crazy
and
crews
that
turn
you
grey
and
a
big
fat
lump
of
insurance
to
cover
the
risk
on
the
way
the
others
they
durs
do
it
they
said
they
valued
their
life
they
served
me
since
as
skippers
went
and
i
took
my
wife
over
the
world
i
drove
married
at
and
your
mother
saving
the
money
and
making
a
man
of
me
was
content
to
be
master
but
she
said
there
was
better
behind
she
took
the
chances
i
would
and
i
followed
your
mother
blind
she
egged
me
to
borrow
the
money
an
she
helped
me
to
clear
the
loan
when
we
bought
half
shares
in
a
cheap
and
hoisted
a
flag
of
our
own
patching
and
coaling
on
credit
and
living
the
lord
knew
how
we
started
the
red
ox
freighters
we
now
and
those
were
the
days
of
clippers
and
the
freights
were
and
we
knew
we
were
making
our
fortune
but
she
died
in
macassar
straits
by
the
little
paternosters
as
you
come
to
the
union
bank
and
we
dropped
her
in
fourteen
fathom
i
pricked
it
off
where
she
sank
owners
we
were
full
owners
and
the
boat
was
christened
for
her
and
she
died
in
the
my
heart
how
young
we
were
so
i
went
on
a
spree
round
java
and
ran
her
ashore
but
your
mother
came
and
warned
me
and
i
would
liquor
no
more
strict
i
stuck
to
my
business
afraid
to
stop
or
i
think
saving
the
money
she
warned
me
and
letting
the
other
men
drink
and
i
met
in
london
i
turned
five
then
and
us
we
started
the
foundry
three
forges
and
twenty
men
cheap
repairs
for
the
cheap
it
paid
and
the
business
grew
for
i
bought
me
a
patent
and
that
was
a
gold
mine
too
to
build
than
buy
said
but
he
shied
and
we
wasted
a
year
in
talking
before
we
moved
to
the
clyde
and
the
lines
were
all
beginning
and
we
all
of
us
started
fair
building
our
engines
like
houses
and
staying
the
boilers
square
but
wanted
cabins
with
marble
and
maple
and
all
and
brussels
an
utrecht
velvet
and
baths
and
a
social
hall
and
pipes
for
closets
all
over
and
cutting
the
frames
too
light
but
he
died
in
the
sixties
and
well
i
dying
i
knew
knew
what
was
coming
when
we
bid
on
the
keel
they
piddled
and
piffled
with
iron
i
given
my
orders
for
steel
steel
and
the
first
expansions
it
paid
i
tell
you
it
paid
when
we
came
with
our
freighters
and
collared
the
trade
and
they
asked
me
how
i
did
it
and
i
gave
the
scripture
text
keep
your
light
so
shining
a
little
in
front
o
the
next
they
copied
all
they
could
follow
but
they
could
copy
my
mind
and
i
left
sweating
and
stealing
a
year
and
a
half
behind
then
came
the
but
that
was
side
he
was
always
best
in
the
foundry
but
better
perhaps
he
died
i
went
through
his
private
papers
the
notes
was
plainer
than
print
and
i
no
fool
to
finish
if
a
man
give
me
a
hint
i
remember
his
widow
was
angry
so
i
saw
what
the
drawings
meant
and
i
started
the
rollers
and
it
paid
me
sixty
per
cent
sixty
per
cent
failures
and
more
than
twice
we
could
do
and
a
to
credit
and
i
saved
it
all
for
you
i
thought
it
does
matter
you
seemed
to
favour
your
ma
but
you
nearer
forty
than
thirty
and
i
know
the
kind
you
are
harrer
an
trinity
college
i
ought
to
ha
sent
you
to
sea
but
i
stood
you
an
education
an
what
have
you
done
for
me
the
things
i
knew
was
proper
you
would
thank
me
to
give
and
the
things
i
knew
was
rotten
you
said
was
the
way
to
live
for
you
muddled
with
books
and
pictures
an
china
an
etchin
an
fans
and
your
rooms
at
college
was
beastly
more
like
a
whore
than
a
man
till
you
married
that
woman
as
white
and
as
stale
as
a
bone
an
she
gave
you
your
social
nonsense
but
where

kid
o
your
own
i
seen
your
carriages
blocking
the
half
o
the
cromwell
road

made
it
in

with
a
fuse
an
a
mine
to
blow
up
the
gates
that
are
rushed
by
the

etc
they
send
us
behind

i
thought
i
knew

an
it
was
me
we
was
under
bedsteads
more
than
a
march
away
we
was
lyin
up
like
rabbits
all
about
the
countryside
an
the
major
cursed
maker
lived
to
see
that
day
an
the
colonel
broke
sword
acrost
an
cried
we
was
rotten
we
started
we
was
never
we
made
it
out
a
favour
if
an
order
was
obeyed
yes
every
little
drummer
rights
an
wrongs
to
mind
so
we
had
to
pay
for
teachin
an
we
paid
the
papers
it
but
you
know
the
army
knows
we
was
put
to
groomin
camels
till
the
regiments
withdrew
an
they
gave
us
each
a
medal
for
subduin
england
foes
an
i
you
like
my
song
because
it
true
an
there
ai
no
chorus
to
give
nor
there
ai
no
band
to
play
but
i
wish
i
was
dead
i
done
what
i
did
or
seen
what
i
seed
that
day
men
that
fought
at
a
song
of
instruction
the
men
that
fought
at
minden
they
was
rookies
in
their
time
so
was
them
that
fought
at
waterloo
all
the
command
yuss
from
minden
to
maiwand
they
was
once
dam
sweeps
like
you
then
do
not
be
discouraged
is
your
we
learn
you
not
to
forget
an
you
must
swear
an
curse
or
you
only
catch
it
worse
for
we
make
you
soldiers
yet
the
men
that
fought
at
minden
they
stocks
beneath
their
chins
six
inch
an
more
but
fatigue
it
was
their
pride
and
they
not
be
denied
to
clean
the
floor
the
men
that
fought
at
minden
they
had
anarchistic
bombs
served
to
by
name
of
but
they
got
it
in
the
eye
same
as
you
will
when
they
clubbed
their
the
men
that
fought
at
minden
they
buttons
up
an
down
dozen
of
told
but
they
did
grouse
an
shirk
at
an
hour
extry
work
they
kept
bright
as
gold
the
men
that
fought
at
minden
they
was
armed
with
musketoons
also
they
was
drilled
by
i
do
know
what
they
were
but
the
sergeants
took
good
care
they
washed
their
ears
the
men
that
fought
at
minden
they
ever
cash
in
which
they
did
not
bank
nor
save
but
spent
it
gay
an
free
on
their
betters
such
as
me
for
the
good
advice
i
gave
the
men
that
fought
at
minden
they
was
civil
yuss
they
was
never
did
talk
o
rights
an
wrongs
but
they
got
it
with
the
toe
same
as
you
will
get
it
so
for
interrupting
songs
the
men
that
fought
at
minden
they
was
several
other
things
which
i
do
remember
clear
but
the
reason
why
now
the
men
are
dry
the
rooks
will
stand
the
beer
then
do
not
be
discouraged
is
your
we
learn
you
not
to
forget
an
you
must
swear
an
curse
or
you
only
catch
it
worse
for
we

my
girl

an
found
an
known
an
met
along

can
not
say
the
things

feel
and
so
i
sing
my
evenin
song
for
to
admire
an
for
to
see
for
to
this
world
so
wide
it
never
done
no
good
to
me
but
i
ca
drop
it
if
i
tried
when
earth
last
picture
is
painted
and
the
tubes
are
twisted
and
dried
when
the
oldest
colours
have
faded
and
the
youngest
critic
has
died
we
shall
rest
and
faith
we
shall
need
it
lie
down
for
an
aeon
or
two
till
the
master
of
all
good
workmen
shall
put
us
to
work
anew
and
those
that
were
good
shall
be
happy
they
shall
sit
in
a
golden
chair
they
shall
splash
at
a
canvas
with
brushes
of
comets
hair
they
shall
find
real
saints
to
draw
from
magdalene
peter
and
paul
they
shall
work
for
an
age
at
a
sitting
and
never
be
tired
at
all
and
only
the
master
shall
praise
us
and
only
the
master
shall
blame
and
no
one
shall
work
for
money
and
no
one
shall
work
for
fame
but
each
for
the
joy
of
the
working
and
each
in
his
separate
star
shall
draw
the
thing
as
he
sees
it
for
the
god
of
things
as
they
are
