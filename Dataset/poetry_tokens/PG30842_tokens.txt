poems
for
no
eyes
shall
see
the
poems
that
i
write
for
you
not
even
yours
but
after
long
forgetful
years
have
passed
on
our
delight
some
hand
may
chance
upon
a
dusty
song
of
those
fond
days
when
every
spoken
word
was
sweet
and
all
the
fleeting
things
unspoken
yet
sweeter
and
the
music
half
unheard
murmured
through
forests
as
a
charm
unbroken
it
is
the
plain
and
ordinary
page
of
two
who
loved
and
clear
will
you
o
stranger
of
another
age
not
grant
a
human
and
compassionate
tear
to
us
who
each
the
other
held
so
dear
a
single
tear
fraternal
sadly
shed
since
that
which
was
so
living
is
so
dead
song
let
us
go
back
let
us
go
back
together
to
the
hills
weary
am
i
of
palaces
and
courts
weary
of
words
disloyal
to
my
thoughts
come
my
beloved
let
us
to
the
hills
let
us
go
back
together
to
the
land
and
wander
hand
in
hand
upon
the
heights
kings
have
we
seen
and
manifold
delights
oh
my
beloved
let
us
to
the
land
lone
and
unshackled
let
us
to
the
road
which
holds
enchantment
round
each
hidden
bend
our
course
uncompassed
and
our
whim
its
end
our
feet
once
more
beloved
to
the
road
song
my
spirit
like
a
shepherd
boy
convalescente
di
squisiti
mali
my
spirit
like
a
shepherd
boy
goes
dancing
down
the
lane
when
all
the
world
is
young
with
joy
must
i
lie
here
in
pain
with
shepherd
pipe
my
spirit
fled
and
cloven
foot
of
pan
the
mortal
bondage
he
has
shed
and
shackling
yoke
of
man
and
though
he
leave
me
cold
and
mute
a
traitor
to
his
care
i
smile
to
hear
his
honeyed
flute
hang
on
the
scented
air
convalescence
when
i
am
in
the
orient
once
again
and
turn
into
the
gay
and
squalid
street
one
side
in
the
shadow
one
in
vivid
heat
the
thought
of
england
fresh
beneath
the
rain
will
rise
unbidden
as
a
gently
pain
the
lonely
hours
of
illness
as
they
beat
crawling
through
days
with
slow
laborious
feet
and
i
lay
gazing
through
the
leaded
pane
idle
and
listened
to
the
swallows
cry
after
the
flitting
insect
swiftly
caught
those
hours
as
they
went
by
stamped
as
their
heritage
upon
my
thought
the
memory
of
a
square
of
summer
sky
jagged
by
the
gables
of
a
gothic
court
to
knole
october
i
i
left
thee
in
the
crowds
and
in
the
light
and
if
i
laughed
or
sorrowed
none
could
tell
they
could
not
know
our
true
and
deep
farewell
was
spoken
in
the
long
preceding
night
thy
mighty
shadow
in
the
garden
dip
to
others
dormant
but
to
me
awake
i
saw
a
window
in
the
moonlight
shake
and
traced
the
angle
of
the
gable
lip
and
knew
thy
soul
benign
and
grave
and
mild
towards
me
morsel
of
morality
and
grieving
at
the
parting
soon
to
be
a
patriarch
about
to
lose
a
child
for
many
come
and
soon
their
tale
is
told
and
thou
remainest
dimly
feeling
pain
aware
the
time
draws
near
to
don
again
the
sober
mourning
of
the
very
old
ii
pictures
and
galleries
and
empty
rooms
small
wonder
that
my
games
were
played
alone
half
of
the
rambling
house
to
call
my
own
and
wooded
gardens
with
mysterious
glooms
my
fingers
ran
among
the
tassels
faded
my
playmates
moved
in
arrases
brocaded
i
slept
beside
the
canopied
and
shaded
beds
of
forgotten
kings
i
wandered
shoeless
in
the
galleries
i
contemplated
long
the
tapestries
and
loved
the
ladies
for
their
histories
and
hands
with
many
rings
beneath
an
oriel
window
facing
south
through
which
the
unniggard
sun
poured
morning
streams
i
daily
stood
and
laughing
drank
the
beams
and
catching
fistfuls
pressed
them
in
my
mouth
this
i
remember
and
the
carven
oak
the
long
and
polished
floors
the
many
stairs
th
heraldic
windows
and
the
velvet
chairs
and
portraits
that
i
knew
so
well
they
almost
spoke
iii
so
i
have
loved
thee
as
a
lonely
child
might
love
the
kind
and
venerable
sire
with
whom
he
lived
and
whom
at
youthful
fire
had
ever
sagely
tolerantly
smiled
in
whose
old
weathered
brain
a
boundless
store
lay
hid
of
riches
never
to
be
spent
who
often
to
the
coaxing
child
unbent
in
hours
enchantment
of
delightful
lore
so
in
the
night
we
parted
friend
of
years
i
rose
a
stranger
to
thee
on
the
morrow
thy
stateliness
knows
neither
joy
nor
sorrow
i
will
not
wound
such
dignity
by
tears
disillusion
i
wrote
the
burning
words
to
you
that
meant
so
much
to
me
i
sent
them
speeding
straight
to
you
to
you
across
the
sea
i
waited
with
sure
reckoning
for
your
reply
to
me
i
waited
and
the
counted
day
fruitlessly
came
and
went
i
made
excuse
for
the
delay
pitiable
confident
i
knew
light
must
bring
the
words
you
must
have
sent
and
still
i
stand
on
that
dim
verge
and
look
across
the
sea
the
waves
have
changed
into
a
dirge
their
volubility
and
in
my
disillusioned
heart
is
a
little
grave
for
me
but
still
with
shaded
eyes
i
gaze
as
mournfully
i
sing
and
one
by
one
the
trailing
days
as
they
no
message
bring
fall
with
their
slow
monotony
as
beads
fall
from
a
string
the
banquet
wine
ran
rich
yellow
wine
upon
the
marble
floor
recklessly
spilled
the
nubians
ran
to
pour
a
fresh
libation
and
to
scatter
showers
of
red
rose
petals
candles
overturned
smouldered
among
the
ruins
of
the
flowers
and
overhead
swung
heavy
shadowy
bowers
of
blue
and
purple
grapes
and
strange
fantastic
shapes
of
varied
birds
where
lanterns
hung
and
dimly
burned
the
melon
and
the
orange
turned
to
use
as
golden
balls
with
laughter
lightly
tossed
lay
burst
and
drained
of
their
sweet
juice
uselessly
ripened
and
for
ever
lost
all
glowing
as
they
lay
upon
the
ground
as
envious
of
their
fellows
who
piled
in
luscious
reds
and
yellows
enriched
the
tables
all
around
the
tables
low
sheltering
the
reclining
grace
here
through
the
curling
smoke
a
swarthy
face
and
jewelled
turban
bound
about
the
head
and
here
the
glow
of
red
carnation
pressed
to
lips
as
warmly
red
and
as
they
lay
in
their
luxurious
ease
playing
with
grapes
and
slim
and
willowy
in
the
hope
to
please
twisted
and
danced
before
them
to
the
dim
uncertain
music
in
the
shadows
played
some
came
with
supple
limb
with
mystery
aid
and
creep
others
with
riotous
leap
and
made
festivity
to
bacchus
wed
others
with
stiff
egyptian
tread
and
straight
black
hair
hanging
in
glossy
braid
they
danced
unnoted
and
exhausted
fled

so
prodigal
was
i
of
youth
forgetting
i
was
young
i
worshipped
dead
men
for
their
strength
forgetting
i
was
strong
i
cherished
old
jejune
advice
i
thought
i
groped
for
truth
those
dead
old
languages
i
learned
when
i
was
prodigal
of
youth
then
in
the
sunlight
stood
a
boy
outstretching
either
hand
palm
upwards
and
between
the
fingers
trickled
sand
oh
why
so
grave
he
cried
to
me
laugh
stern
lips
laugh
at
last
let
wisdom
come
when
wisdom
may
the
sand
is
running
fast
i
followed
him
into
the
sun
and
laughed
as
he
desired
and
every
day
upon
the
grass
we
play
till
we
are
tired
a
creed
that
i
should
live
and
look
with
open
eyes
i
count
as
half
my
claim
to
paradise
i
have
not
crept
beneath
cathedral
arches
but
bathed
in
streams
beneath
the
silver
larches
and
have
not
grovelled
to
the
sunday
priest
but
found
an
unconfined
and
daily
feast
was
called
ungodly
and
to
those
who
blamed
laughed
back
defiance
and
was
not
ashamed
some
hold
their
duty
to
be
mournful
why
i
can
not
love
your
weeping
poets
i
am
sad
in
winter
but
in
summer
gay
and
vary
with
each
variable
day
and
though
the
pious
cavilled
at
my
mirth
at
least
i
rendered
thanks
for
god
fair
earth
grateful
that
i
among
the
murmuring
rest
was
not
an
unappreciative
guest
to
a
poet
whose
verses
i
had
read
i
would
not
venture
to
dispraise
or
praise
too
well
i
know
the
indifference
which
bounds
a
poet
in
the
narrow
where
he
is
blind
and
deaf
in
all
his
ways
he
must
work
out
alone
his
path
to
glory
a
thousand
breaths
are
fanning
him
along
a
thousand
tears
end
in
one
little
song
a
thousand
conflicts
in
one
little
story
a
thousand
notes
swell
to
a
single
chord
he
can
not
tell
where
his
direction
tends
he
strives
unguided
towards
indefinite
ends
he
is

ignorant
though
absolute

on

have
tasted

falling
as
we
went
now
with
narrow
bonds
and
limits
never
could
we
be
content
for
we
have
abolished
boundaries
straitened
borders
have
we
rent
and
a
house
no
more
confines
us
than
the
roving
nomad
tent
the
garden
we
owned
a
garden
on
a
hill
we
planted
rose
and
daffodil
flowers
that
english
poets
sing
and
hoped
for
glory
in
the
spring
we
planted
yellow
hollyhocks
and
humble
stocks
and
columbine
for
carnival
and
dreamt
of
summer
festival
and
autumn
not
to
be
outdone
as
heiress
of
the
summer
sun
should
doubly
wreathe
her
tawny
head
with
poppies
and
with
creepers
red
we
waited
then
for
all
to
grow
we
planted
wallflowers
in
a
row
and
lavendar
and
borage
blue
alas
we
waited
i
and
you
but
love
was
all
that
ever
grew
long
barn
summer
the
dancing
i
woke
to
daylight
and
to
find
a
wreath
of
fading
rough
entwined
lying
as
dropped
in
hasty
flight
upon
my
floor
dropped
from
thy
head
sweet
spirit
of
the
night
who
with
footstep
light
blown
in
by
the
soft
breeze
as
thistledown
in
through
my
open
door
whence
from
the
woodland
from
the
fields
of
corn
from
flirting
airily
with
the
bright
moon
playing
throughout
the
hours
that
go
too
soon
ready
to
fly
at
the
approach
of
morn
thou
bent
on
the
curious
quest
to
see
what
mortal
guest
dwelt
in
the
cottage
built
to
face
the
dawn
thou
didst
pause
shy
timid
on
the
threshold
though
there
laughed
the
mischief
in
thy
roguish
eyes
then
soft
thou
crosst
the
room
on
tiptoe
to
my
bed
one
finger
on
thy
lip
cautious
to
make
no
slip
i
saw
the
wreath
of
on
thy
head
then
with
a
twirl
thinking
i
slept
and
a
joyous
whirl
into
a
dance
leapt
the
careless
spirit
too
long
restrained
the
purest
dancing
feet
sometimes
chancing
to
touch
the
ground
then
starting
up
with
a
fresh
high
bound
to
hang
for
a
moment
poised
in
the
air
and
a
glimpse
of
white
teeth
glancing
and
a
laughing
face
beneath
tossing
hair
an
orgy
a
revel
a
living
joy
embodied
in
one
slim
woodland
boy
dancing
forward
backward
now
here
now
there
swaying
to
every
impulse
unconstrained
thou
wert
too
pure
for
bacchus
and
too
young
for
pan
what
wert
thou
in
the
daytime
dost
thou
sleep
in
a
cave
like
a
grave
till
the
moon
calls
thee
in
the
sleep
of
man
to
thy
light
revels
through
the
sombre
deep
wood
shadows
to
a
space
among
the
trees
where
the
breeze
makes
music
through
the
branches
for
thy
dance
and
the
and
silent
deer
stand
round
peeping
through
and
each
forest
sound
the
trickling
murmur
in
its
dreams
the
shepherd
pipe
by
chance
melt
all
for
thee
to
one
soft
harmony
while
for
the
lighting
of
thy
mossy
slope
the
moon
thy
lover
sheds
an
opal
glow
pale
the
colour
of
the
leaves
of
the
limelight
on
the
stage
for
youth
and
joy
and
hope
and
at
the
first
rose
menace
of
the
dawn
must
thou
go
fly
to
thy
cave
thou
little
pagan
faun
the
fount
of
joy
was
bubbling
in
thine
eyes
dancing
was
in
thy
feet
and
on
thy
lips
a
laugh
that
never
dies
unutterably
sweet
dance
on
for
ever
young
for
ever
fair
lightfooted
as
a
frightened
bounding
deer
thy
wreath
of
twisted
in
thy
hair
through
all
the
changing
seasons
of
the
year
and
tread
to
autumn
gorgeous
hymn
of
praise
and
to
the
happy
spring
light
lilt
of
pleasure
and
to
the
dirgeful
chant
of
winter
days
and
ever
varying
ever
suited
measure
and
in
the
summer
when
the
reeking
earth
swings
a
vast
censer
as
it
is
most
meet
praise
thou
for
lavish
gifts
new
hopes
new
birth
praise
with
the
dancing
of
thy
tireless
feet
i
woke
to
daylight
and
to
find
a
wreath
of
fading

entwined
lying
as
dropped
in
hasty
flight

my
floor
reprinted
by
kind
permission
of
the
editor
of
the
english
review
where
it
first
appeared
in
august
constantinople
for
for
years
it
had
been
neglected
this
wilderness
garden
of
ours
and
its
ruin
had
shone
reflected
in
its
pools
through
abandoned
hours
for
none
had
cared
for
its
beauty
till
we
came
the
strangers
the
giaours
and
none
had
thought
of
a
duty
towards
its
squandering
flowers
of
broken
wells
and
fountains
there
were
half
a
dozen
or
more
and
beyond
the
sea
the
mountains
of
that
far
bithynian
shore
were
blue
in
the
purple
distance
and
white
was
the
cap
they
wore
and
never
in
our
existence
had
life
seemed
brighter
before
and
the
grew
in
profusion
quince
and
pomegranate
and
wine
and
the
roses
in
rich
confusion
with
the
lilac
intertwine
and
the
banksia
rose
the
creeper
which
is
golden
like
yellow
wine
is
surely
more
gorgeous
and
deeper
in
this
garden
of
mine
and
thine
and
the
little
bright
flowers
in
the
grasses
cyclamen
daffodil
are
crushed
by
the
foot
that
passes
but
seem
to
grow
thicker
still
in
the
cool
grey
shadows
they
grow
at
their
own
free
will
in
the
grass
as
in
english
meadows
on
the
slope
of
an
english
hill
is
it
best
when
the
lone
wanders
by
with
his
strange
little
tune
and
the
muezzin
sings
out
for
prayer
thrice
daily
his
arabic
rune
once
when
the
sunset
has
faded
once
in
the
brilliant
noon
or
once
in
the
daybreak
a
farewell
to
the
dying
moon
i
know
so
well
the
busy
cries
that
echo
through
the
quarter
till
daylight
into
evening
dies
and
stars
shine
in
the
water
so
dear
they
have
become
to
me

country
nights
their
rapid
gay
succession
and
all
the
lights
will
pass
from
my
possession
but
never
from
my
memory
leblebidji
leblebidji
past
english
evening
scents
and
sounds
past
english
ringing
the
turkish
watchman
on
his
rounds
the
turkish
pedlar
singing
through
narrow
streets
above
the
sea
leblebidji
leblebidji
will
surely
pierce
a
ghostly
way
the
music
underlying
and
in
the
shades
of
falling
day
as
in
the
distance
dying
a
little
call
will
come
to
me
leblebidji
little
white

the
muezzin
above
the
city
at
his
feet
above
the
dome
above
the
sea
he
rises
unconfined
and
free
to
break
upon
the
noonday
heat
he
turns
around
the
parapet
against
the
marble
tower
his
singing
gains
or
loses
power
in
pacing
round
the
minaret
a
brother
to
the
singing
birds
he
never
knew
restraining
walls
but
freely
rises
freely
falls
the
rhythm
of
the
sacred
words
i
would
that
it
to
me
were
given
to
climb
each
day
the
muezzin
stair
and
in
the
warm
and
silent
air
to
sing
my
heart
out
into
heaven
the

a
sunny
court
with
wooden
balconies
and
wool
hung
out
to
dry
in
gaudy
skeins
a
fountain
and
some
pigeons
murmuringly
picking
up
yellow
grains
pass
through
a
little
green
door
into
the
dark
and
crowded
shop
the
turk
crouching
above
the
brasier
smiles
and
nods

all
his
daily
work
here
marble
heads
and
alabaster
jars
fragments
of
porphyry
and
persian
tiles
lie
heaped
in
ruin
and
at
our
dismay
the
old
turk
shrugs
and
smiles
and
sips
his
coffee
reaching
out
a
hand
to
throw
upon
the
brasier
at
his
feet
a
handful
of
dried
herbs
whose
sudden
smoke
rises
up
yanghin
as
the
baying
of
wolves
from
afar
borne
on
the
wind
from
the
golden
horn
a
cry
in
the
distance
yanghin

suddenly
waking
the
silent
night
suddenly
breaking
the
sleeping

the
long
far
wailing
alarm

the
startles
a
warning
light
as
a
torch
passed
from
hand
to
hand
as
a
beacon
springing
from
hill
to
hill
the
cry
draws
nearer
though
distant
still
and
the
watch
throws
it
on
from
stand
to
stand
and
the
voices
rise
as
a
tempest
far
as
the
swell
of
waves
on
a
rocky
shore
each
rumbles
louder
than
before
yanghin

as
the

bearing
the
wrath

the
angel

the
flaming
sword
the
voice
passes
onward
below
in
the
street
faintly
it
travels
again
from
afar
and
as
an
echo
of
terror
past
the
wind
from
the
bosphorus

morning

an
early
morning
of

a
blending
of
the
mist
and
sea
and
sun
into
an
undistinguishable
one
and
saint
sophia
from
her
lordly
throne
rises
above
the
opalescent
cloud
a
shadowy
dome
and
soaring
minaret
visable
though
the
base
be
hidden
yet
beneath
the
veiling
wreaths
of
milky
shroud
as
some
dark
turkish
beauty
haughtily
glances
above
the
yashmak
snowy
fold
beyond

long
stretch
a
bar
of
gold
falls
from

distant

retour
en
songe
after
a
voyage
we
came
with
sails
all
set
towards
the
city
of
the
sea
and
it
was
wonderful
to
me
to
find
her
reigning
yet
oh
beauty
that
my
eyes
and
heart
had
feasted
on
before
the
evening
mosques
were
brushed
with
gold
the
water
lapped
a
lazy
fold
upon
that
lovely
shore
the
gardens
of
her
terraced
hills
rose
up
above
the
port
and
little
houses
half
concealed
the
presence
of
a
light
revealed
and
here
my
journey
end
was
sealed
and
i
reached
the
home
i
sought
those
windows
i
had
opened
wide
to
welcome
in
the
sun
those
stairs
that
only
happy
feet
had
measured
with
their
running
beat
that
winding
street
twelve
months
that
were
as
one
should
others
with
their
sordid
cares
and
troubles
enter
here
love
hung
about
the
rooms
like
smoke
and
peace
descended
as
a
cloak
should
i
allow
the
vulgar
folk
to
desecrate
that
year
i
laid
the
fuse
with
steady
hand
we
sailed
into
the
night
from
deck
i
watched
the
flames
arise
remorseless
as
my
tearless
eyes
that
with
the
waves
and
reddened
skies
flung
back
the
angry
light
constantinople
march
mcmxv
i
queen
of
a
double
empire
still
she
stands
and
watches
with
superb
indifferent
eyes
the
eager
wooing
of
imperial
hands
towards
so
fair
and
coveted
a
prize
royal
and
imperial
suitors
has
she
known
pass
one
by
one
across
her
dreaming
years
and
some
a
while
have
climbed
the
golden
throne
and
some
have
passed
away
in
blood
and
tears
for
many
emperors
have
sought
her
grace
since
the
first
constantine
in
sweeping
cloak
her
seven
hills
with
broad
unhurrying
pace
measured
and
rested
not
till
heaven
spoke
a
haughty
fatalist
byzantium
waits
what
chance
the
storing
centuries
bring
forth
another
lover
almost
at
the
gates
heralded
by
the
cannon
of
the
north
a
northern

the
footstep

of

and
interrupted
in
the
sacred
feast
hearing
the
advent
of
the
conqueror
surge
into
the
wall
miraculous
the
priest
entered
and
waits
the
summons
to
emerge
so
on
that
high
and
ceremonial
day
when
russian
czar
and
prince
and
christian
lord
throng
saint
sophia
in
their
packed
array
to
see
the
church
heritage
restored
when
from

saints
look
down
once
more
upon
a
christian
crowd
and
echo
startles
into
life
and
faints
with
rapture
at
gregorian
chanting
loud
and
mass
magnificently
moving
on
towards
its
climax
brings
the
moment
near
after
the
lapse
of
many
centuries
gone
for
christ
in
priestly
hands
to
reappear
when
the
exultant
organ
chord
has
ceased
and
every
head
is
bowed
expectantly
then
at
the
altar
the
byzantine
priest
shall
hold
aloft
the
host
triumphantly
resolution
i
see
the
work
of
others
and
my
heart
sinks
as
my
own
achievement
i
compare
i
will
not
be
irresolute
nor
despair
but
battle
strongly
for
my
struggling
art
convinced
against
conviction
that
my
part
equally
with
my
masters
i
can
bear
although
their
monuments
are
very
fair
enriched
with
statues
and
i
stand
apart
and
gaze
upon
my
little
heap
of
stones
which
i
was
given
to
build
with
very
few
as
yet
laid
into
place
but
i
will
lay
blind
to
these
marble
monuments
and
thrones
building
as
though
i
confidently
knew
my
ultimate
end
a
stone
in
place
each
day
end
