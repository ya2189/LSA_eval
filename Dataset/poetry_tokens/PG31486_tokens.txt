our
tale
is
a
true
one
from
which
may
be
taught
a
maxim
for
youth
with
utility
fraught
terrors
assail
you
examine
the
cause
and
all
will
be
for
by

kind
laws
nor
goblins

these

are

a
that
comical
tricks
would
be
at
his
frolics
one
morning
began
with
the
he
chatter
as
much
as
to
say
d
ye
do
and
look
her
thanks
and
politely
cried
then
shook
her
paw
and
they
sat
down
together
washing
her
face
indicating
wet
weather
illustration
but
mischief
the
inclining
to
harbour
his
skill
he
resolved
now
to
try
as
a
a
conveniently
lay
in
the
room
miss
he
exclaim
you
be
shaved
i
presume
then
scraping
and
bowing
with
grin
and
grimace
despite
of
resistance
he
lather
her
face
illustration
now
could
not
find
either
razor
or
knife
so
ran
no
hazard
of
losing
her
life
yet
razor
or
knife
though
they
could
not
be
had
found
what
the
terrified
thought
as
bad
a
knife
made
of
ivory
in
use
to
cut
paper
with
which
barber
now
proceeded
to
scrape
her
illustration
but
on
a
sudden
deserted
her
station
disliking
no
wonder
the
strange
operation
and
ran
round
the
room
without
means
of
escaping
while
still
determined
to
give
her
a
scraping
pursued
and
regardless
of
struggle
or
prayer
fast
bound
her
at
last
to
the
back
of
a
chair
illustration
when
tucking
a
napkin
close
under
her
chin
each
mew
of
dismay
he
return
with
a
grin
and
yelling
and
chattering
they
raised
such
a
clatter
that
rush
in
to
learn
what
was
the
matter
when
overturning
the
chair
midst
the
clack
ran
off
leaving
stretched
out
on
her
back
illustration
the
sight
was
to
so
curious
that
faster
she
ran
than
to
tell
and
but
when
they
came
up
neither
nor
the
was
there
to
account
for
improper
behaviour
for
had
contrived
amid
alarms
to
reach
the
with
miss
in
his
arms
illustration
now
fearing
that
or
miss
might
be
maim
go
fetch
a
long
ladder
the
exclaim
and
bring
them
down
quickly
both
and
oh
oh
thought
the
i
suffer
the
ladder
was
climb
by
a
servant
so
valiant
but
with
loose
tiles
soon
repulsed
the
assailant
illustration
against
all
manoeuvre
apparently
proof
chatter
and
paced
to
and
fro
on
the
roof
and
fondled
the
and
next
pitying
her
case
he
wiped
with
the
napkin
the
suds
from
her
face
as
nurse
would
a
child
then
he
held
her
out
while
all
the
spectators
kept
laughing
below
illustration
now
seeing
him
thus
to
good
humour
inclined
they
thought
he
might
prove
more
pacific
of
mind
so
mounted
the
ladder
another
assailer
when
of
loose
tiles
now
perceiving
a
failure
eluded
the
grasp
of
pursuit
with
a
hop

gained
an
adjacent

it
chanced
that
the
vent
of
this

chimney
led
direct
to
a
chamber
confined
to
his
bed

lay
an
old
gentleman
ill
with
the
gout
wishing

bad
fate
might

they
kick
up
such
a
rout

caper
the
sick
man
apartment
about
and
chatter
and
squall
in
a
manner
so
hideous
like
young
imps
of
darkness
that
not
to
be
tedious
the
sufferer
forgot
both
his
gout
and
his
prayers
and
scamper
pursued
by
these
phantoms
down
stairs
illustration
there
sat
in
the
parlour
a
medical
man
and
thither
and
now
ran
and
and
the
grown
fiercer
and
bolder
physician
and
patient
seized
each
by
his
shoulder

raised
such
a
yell
