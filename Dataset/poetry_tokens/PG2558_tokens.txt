beranger
morris
has
hung
the
most
beautiful
thoughts
in
the
world
upon
hinges
of
illegible
and
his
songs
are
destined
to
roll
over
bright
lips
enough
to
form
a
sonnet
illegible
his
sentiments
are
simple
honest
truthful
and
familiar
his
language
is
pure
and
eminently
musical
and
he
is
prodigally
full
of
the
poetry
of
living
willis
the
distinction
with
which
the
name
of
general
morris
is
now
associated
in
a
permanent
connection
with
what
is
least
factitious
or
fugitive
in
american
art
is
admitted
and
known
but
the
class
of
young
men
of
letters
in
this
country
at
present
can
hardly
appreciate
the
extent
to
which
they
and
the
profession
to
which
they
belong
are
indebted
to
his
animated
exertions
his
varied
talents
his
admirable
resources
of
temper
during
a
period
of
twenty
years
and
at
a
time
when
the
character
of
american
literature
both
at
home
and
abroad
was
yet
to
be
formed
the
first
great
service
which
the
literary
taste
of
this
country
received
was
rendered
by
dennie
a
remarkable
man
qualified
by
nature
and
attainments
to
be
a
leader
in
new
circumstances
fit
to
take
part
in
the
formation
of
a
national
literature
as
a
vindicator
of
independence
in
thought
able
to
establish
freedom
without
disturbing
the
obligations
of
law
as
a
conservative
in
taste
skilful
to
keep
the
tone
of
the
great
models
with
which
his
studies
were
familiar
without
copying
their
style
by
both
capacities
successful
in
developing
the
one
unchangeable
spirit
of
art
under
a
new
form
and
with
new
effects
in
this
office
of
of
our
native
forces
general
morris
succeeded
him
under
increased
advantages
in
some
respect
with
higher
powers
in
a
different
and
certainly
a
vastly
more
extended
sphere
of
influence
the
manifold
and
lasting
benefits
which
as
editor
of
the
mirror
general
morris
conferred
on
art
and
artists
of
every
kind
by
his
tact
his
liberality
the
superiority
of
his
judgement
and
the
vigor
of
his
abilities
by
the
perseverance
and
address
with
which
he
disciplined
a
corps
of
youthful
writers
in
the
presence
of
a
constant
and
heavy
fire
from
the
batteries
of
foreign
criticism
by
the
rare
combination
so
valuable
in
dealing
with
the
numerous
aspirants
in
authorship
with
whom
his
position
brought
him
in
contact
of
a
quick
true
eye
to
discern
in
the
modesty
of
some
nameless
manuscript
the
future
promises
of
a
power
hardly
yet
conscious
of
itself
a
discretion
to
guide
by
sound
advice
and
a
generosity
to
aid
with
the
most
important
kind
of
assistance
the
firm
and
open
temper
which
his
example
tended
to
inspire
into
the
relations
of
literary
men
with
one
another
throughout
the
land
and
more
than
all
perhaps
by
the
harmony
and
union
of
such
inappreciable
value
especially
in
the
beginning
of
national
effort
between
the
several
sister
arts
of
writing
music
painting
and
dramatic
exhibition
which
the
singular
variety
and
discursiveness
of
his
intellectual
sympathies
led
him
constantly
to
maintain
and
vindicate
these
in
the
multiplicity
of
their
operation
and
the
full
power
of
their
joint
effect
can
be
perfectly
understood
only
by
those
who
possessed
a
contemporaneous
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
and
who
remembering
the
state
of
things
at
the
commencement
of
the
period
alluded
to
and
observing
what
existed
at
the
end
of
it
are
able
to
look
back
over
the
whole
interval
and
see
to
what
influences
and
what
persons
the
extraordinary
change
which
has
taken
place
is
to
be
referred
if
at
this
moment
the
literary
genius
of
america
renewed
in
youth
and
quivering
lie
the
eagle
wings
with
excess
of
vigor
seems
about
to
make
a
new
flight
from
a
higher
into
loftier
depths
of
airy
distance
the
capacity
to
take
that
flight
must
to
a
great
degree
be
ascribed
to
those
two
persons
whom
we
have
named
without
whose
services
the
brighter
era
which
appears
now
to
be
dawning
might
yet
be
distant
and
doubtful
besides
these
particulars
of
past
effort
which
ought
to
make
his
countrymen
love
the
reputation
of
the
subject
of
this
notice
we
regret
that
our
limits
forbid
us
to
speak
at
large
of
those
more
intimate
qualities
of
personal
value
which
in
our
judgment
form
the
genuine
lustre
of
one
who
admirable
for
other
attainments
is
to
be
imitated
in
these
to
us
it
is
an
instinctive
feeling
that
a
wrong
is
done
to
the
proper
grandeur
of
our
complex
nature
that
a
violence
is
offered
to
the
higher
consciousness
of
our
immortal
being
whenever
an
intellectual
quality
is
extolled
tot
he
neglect
of
a
moral
one
moral
excellence
is
the
most
real
genius
and
a
temper
to
cope
and
calmly
baffle
the
multitudinous
assaults
of
the
spiritual
enmity
of
active
life
is
a
talent
which
outshines
all
praise
of
mental
endowments
unhappily
the
biographer
of
literary
creators
affords
few
occasions
in
which
a
feeling
of
this
kind
can
be
indulged
and
gratified
that
sensibility
of
mental
apprehensions
which
is
the
fame
of
the
author
is
usually
attended
by
a
susceptibility
of
passionate
impression
which
is
the
fate
of
the
man
and
earth
and
sense
delight
to
wreak
their
destructive
vengences
upon
the
spiritual
nature
of
him
of
whose
intellectual
being
they
are
the
slaves
and
the
sport
in
the
present
instance
we
are
concerned
with
the
character
teres
atque
rotundus
which
may
be
looked
upon
from
every
side
with
an
equal
satisfaction
search
the
wide
world
over
and
you
shall
not
find
among
the
literary
men
of
any
nation
one
on
whom
the
dignity
of
a
free
and
manly
spirit
sits
with
a
grace
more
native
and
familiar
whose
spontaneous
sentiments
have
a
truer
tone
of
nobleness
the
course
of
whose
usual
feelings
is
more
expanded
and
honorable
whose
acts
whether
common
and
daily
or
deliberate
and
are
wont
at
all
times
to
be
more
beautifully
impressed
with
those
marks
of
sincerity
of
modesty
and
of
justice
which
form
the
very
seal
of
worth
in
conduct
those
jealousies
and
littlenesses
and
envyings
which
prey
upon
the
spirits
of
many
men
as
the
vulture
on
the
heart
that
chained
prometheus
and
whose
fierce
besetment
they
who
will
be
magnanimous
have
to
fight
off
as
one
drives
away
the
eagles
from
their
prey
with
voice
and
gestures
seem
never
to
assail
him
it
is
the
happiness
of
his
nature
to
have
that
only
absolute
deliverance
from
evil
which
is
implied
in
being
rendered
insensible
to
temptation
while
the
duty
which
is
laid
upon
us
in
this
paper
mainly
is
to
open
and
set
forth
his
poetic
praises
and
claim
the
laurel
for
his
literary
merits
when
the
crown
of
song
is
to
be
conferred
upon
him
we
shall
interpose
to
beg
that
the
chaplet
may
be
accompanied
by
some
mark
or
some
inscription
which
shall
declare
this
is
the
reward
of
moral
excellence
for
the
success
of
our
special
purpose
in
this
notice
which
is
to
consider
and
make
apparent
the
specific
character
which
belongs
to
general
morris
as
a
literary
artist
and
a
poetic
creator
to
explain
his
claims
to
that
title
which
the
common
voice
of
the
country
has
given
to
him
of
the
of
america
it
would
have
probably
been
more
judicious
had
we
kept
out
of
view
the
matters
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
it
is
recorded
of
a
grecian
painter
that
having
completed
the
picture
of
a
sleeping
nymph
he
added
on
the
foreground
the
figure
of
a
satyr
gazing
in
amazement
upon
her
beauty
but
finding
that
the
secondary
form
attracted
universal
praise
he
erased
it
as
diverting
applause
from
that
which
he
desired
to
have
regarded
as
the
principal
monument
of
his
skill
there
is
in
this
anecdote
a
double
wisdom
the
world
is
as
little
willing
to
yield
to
a
twofold
superiority
as
it
is
able
to
appreciate
two
distinct
objects
at
once
in
a
review
of
literary
reputations
perhaps
nothing
is
fitted
to
raise
more
surprise
than
the
obvious
inequality
in
the
extend
and
greatness
of
the
labors
to
which
an
equal
reward
of
fame
has
been
allotted
the
abounding
energy
and
picturesque
variety
of
homer
are
illustrated
in
books
the
remains
of
sappho
might
be
written
on
the
surface
of
a
leaf
of
the
laurus
nobilis
yet
if
the
one
expands
before
us
with
the
magnificent
extent
the
diversified
surface
the
endless
decorations
of
the
earth
itself
the
other
hangs
on
high
like
a
lone
clear
star
small
but
intense
flashing
upon
us
through
the
night
of
ages
invested
with
circumstances
of
divinity
not
less
unquestionable
than
those
which
attend
the
venerable
majesty
of
the
ancient
of
song
the
rich
and
roseate
light
that
shines
around
the
name
of
mimnermus
is
shed
from
some
dozen
or
twenty
lines
the
immortality
of
tyrtaeus
rests
upon
a
stanza
or
two
which
have
floated
to
us
with
their
precious
freight
over
the
sea
of
centuries
and
will
float
on
unsubmergible
by
all
the
waves
of
time
the
soul
of
simonides
lives
to
us
in
a
single
couplet
but
that
is
the
very
stuff
of
eternity
which
neither
fire
will
assoil
nor
tempest
peril
nor
the
wrath
of
years
impair
the
infinite
has
no
degrees
wherever
the
world
sees
in
any
human
being
the
fire
of
the
everlasting
it
bows
with
equal
awe
whether
that
fire
is
displayed
by
only
an
occasional
flash
or
by
a
prolonged
and
diffusive
blaze
there
is
a
certain
tone
which
hear
it
when
we
may
and
where
we
may
we
know
to
be
the
accents
of
the
gods
and
whether
its
quality
be
shown
in
a
single
utterance
or
its
volume
displayed
in
a
thousand
bursts
of
music
we
surround
the
band
of
spirits
whom
we
there
detect
in
their
mortal
disguise
with
equal
ceremonies
of
respect
and
worship
hailing
them
alike
as
seraphs
of
a
brighter
sphere
sons
of
the
morning
this
is
natural
and
it
is
reasonable
genius
is
not
a
degree
of
other
qualities
nor
is
it
a
particular
way
or
extent
of
displaying
such
qualities
it
is
a
faculty
by
itself
it
is
a
manner
of
which
we
may
judge
with
the
same
certainty
from
one
exhibition
as
from
many
the
praise
of
a
poet
therefore
is
to
be
determined
not
by
the
nature
of
the
work
which
he
undertakes
but
by
the
kind
of
mastery
which
he
shows
not
by
the
breadth
of
surface
over
which
he
toils
but
by
the
perfectness
of
the
result
which
he
attains
wordsworth
has
vindicated
the
capacity
of
the
sonnet
to
be
a
casket
of
the
richest
gems
of
fame
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
song
may
give
evidence
of
a
genius
which
shall
deserve
to
be
ranked
with
the
constructor
of
an
epic
scorn
not
the
song
we
would
go
so
far
indeed
as
to
say
that
success
in
the
song
imports
necessarily
a
more
inborn
and
genuine
gift
of
poetic
conception
than
the
same
proportion
of
success
in
other
less
simple
modes
of
art
there
are
some
sorts
of
composition
which
may
be
wrought
out
of
eager
feeling
and
the
foam
of
excited
passions
and
which
are
therefore
to
a
large
extent
within
the
reach
of
earnest
sensibilities
and
an
ambitious
will
others
are
the
spontaneous
outflow
of
the
heart
to
whose
perfection
turbulence
and
effort
are
fatal
of
the
latter
kind
is
the
song
while
the
ode
allows
of
exertion
and
strain
what
is
done
in
it
must
be
accomplished
by
native
and
inherent
strength
speaking
with
that
confidence
which
may
not
improperly
be
assumed
by
one
who
having
looked
with
some
care
at
the
foundations
of
the
opinion
which
he
expresses
supposes
himself
able
if
called
upon
by
denial
to
furnish
such
demonstration
of
its
truth
as
the
nature
of
the
matter
allows
of
we
say
that
in
our
judgment
there
is
no
professed
writer
of
songs
in
this
day
who
has
conceived
the
true
character
of
this
delicate
and
peculiar
creation
of
art
with
greater
precision
and
justness
than
morris
or
been
more
felicitous
than
he
in
dealing
with
the
subtle
and
multiform
difficulties
that
beset
its
execution
it
is
well
understood
by
those
whose
thoughts
are
used
to
be
conversant
with
the
suggestions
of
a
deeper
analysis
than
belongs
to
popular
criticism
that
the
forms
of
literary
art
are
not
indefinite
in
number
variable
in
their
characteristics
or
determined
by
the
casual
taste
or
arbitrary
will
of
authors
they
exist
in
nature
they
are
dependent
upon
those
fixed
laws
of
intellectual
being
of
spiritual
affection
and
moral
choice
which
constitute
the
rationality
of
man
and
the
actual
positive
merit
of
a
poetical
production
that
real
merit
which
consists
in
native
vitality
in
inherent
capacity
to
live
does
not
lie
in
the
glitter
or
costliness
of
the
decorations
with
which
it
is
invested
nor
in
the
force
with
which
it
is
made
to
spring
from
the
mind
of
its
creator
into
the
minds
of
others
nor
yet
in
the
scale
of
magnitude
upon
which
the
ideas
belonging
to
the
subject
are
illustrated
in
the
work
but
rather
as
we
suppose
obviously
and
in
all
cases
upon
the
integrity
and
truth
with
which
the
particular
form
that
has
been
contemplated
by
the
artist
is
brought
out
and
the
distinctness
with
which
that
one
specific
impression
which
is
appropriate
to
it
is
attained
this
is
the
kind
of
excellence
which
we
ascribe
to
morris
an
excellence
of
a
lofty
order
genuine
sincere
and
incapable
of
question
more
valuable
in
this
class
of
composition
than
in
any
other
because
both
more
important
and
more
difficult
for
the
song
appears
to
us
to
possess
a
definiteness
peculiarly
jealous
and
exclusive
to
be
less
flexible
in
character
and
to
permit
less
variety
of
tone
than
most
other
classes
of
composition
if
a
man
shall
say
i
will
put
more
force
into
my
song
than
your
model
allows
i
will
charge
it
with
a
greater
variety
of
impressions
it
is
well
if
he
is
skilful
he
may
make
something
that
is
very
valuable
but
in
so
far
as
his
work
is
more
than
a
song
it
is
not
a
song
in
all
works
of
art
wherever
form
is
concerned
excess
is
error
the
just
notion
and
office
of
the
modern
song
as
we
think
of
it
is
to
be
the
embodiment
and
expression
in
beauty
of
some
one
of
those
sentiments
or
thoughts
gay
moral
pensive
joyous
or
melancholy
which
are
as
natural
and
appropriate
in
particular
circumstances
or
to
certain
occasions
as
the
odor
to
the
flower
rising
at
such
seasons
into
the
minds
of
all
classes
of
persons
instinctive
and
unbidden
yet
in
obedience
to
some
law
of
association
which
it
is
the
gift
of
the
poet
to
apprehend
its
graceful
purpose
is
to
exhibit
an
incident
in
the
substance
of
an
emotion
to
communicate
wisdom
in
the
form
of
sentiment
it
is
the
refracted
gleam
of
some
wandering
ray
from
the
fair
orb
of
moral
truth
which
glancing
against
some
occurrence
in
common
life
is
surprised
into
a
smile
of
many
colored
beauty
it
is
the
airy
ripple
that
is
thrown
up
when
the
current
of
feeling
in
human
hearts
accidentally
encounters
the
current
of
thought
and
bubbles
forth
with
a
gentle
fret
of
sparkling
foam
almost
and
obedient
in
its
development
and
shaping
to
some
inward
spark
of
beauty
which
appears
to
possess
and
control
its
course
it
might
almost
seem
that
in
the
loveliness
of
such
productions
sentiment
made
substantial
in
language
floated
abroad
in
natural
as
that
heat
which
is
not
yet
flame
gives
forth
in
blue
wreaths
of
vaporous
grace
which
unfold
their
delicateness
for
a
moment
upon
the
tranquil
air
and
then
vanish
away
it
is
not
an
artificial
structure
built
up
by
intellect
after
a
model
foreshaped
by
fancy
or
foreshadowed
by
the
instincts
of
the
passions
it
is
a
simple
emotion
crystalled
into
beauty
by
passing
for
a
moment
through
the
cooler
air
of
the
mind
it
is
merely
an
effluence
of
creative
vigor
a
graceful
feeling
thickened
into
words
its
proper
dwelling
is
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
sentiments
no
the
passions
it
will
not
indeed
repel
the
sympathy
of
deeper
feelings
but
knows
them
rather
under
the
form
of
the
flower
that
floats
upon
the
surface
of
meditation
than
of
the
deeper
root
that
lies
beneath
its
stream
and
this
is
the
grievous
fault
of
nearly
all
lord
byron
melodies
that
he
pierces
them
too
profoundly
and
passes
below
the
region
of
grace
charging
his
lyre
with
far
more
vehemence
of
passion
than
its
slight
strings
are
meant
to
bear
the
beauty
which
belongs
to
this
production
should
be
in
the
form
of
the
thought
rather
than
the
fashion
of
the
setting
that
genuineness
and
simplicity
of
character
which
constitute
almost
its
essence
are
destroyed
by
any
appearance
of
the
cold
artifices
of
construction
palpable
springs
set
for
our
admiration
whereby
the
beginning
is
obviously
arranged
in
reference
to
a
particular
ending
this
is
the
power
of
moore
guilty
by
design
of
that
departure
from
simplicity
by
which
he
fascinated
one
generation
at
the
expense
of
being
forgotten
by
another
the
song
while
it
is
general
in
its
impression
should
be
particular
in
its
occasion
not
an
abstraction
of
the
mind
but
a
definite
feeling
special
to
some
certain
set
of
circumstances
rising
from
out
the
surface
of
daily
experience
like
the
watery
issuings
of
a
fountain
it
throws
itself
upward
for
a
moment
then
descends
in
a
soft
glittering
shower
to
the
level
whence
it
rose
herein
resides
the
chief
defect
of
bayly
songs
that
they
are
too
general
and
vague
a
species
of
pattern
songs
being
embodiments
of
some
general
feeling
or
reflection
but
lacking
that
sufficient
reference
to
some
season
or
occurrence
which
would
justify
their
appearing
and
take
away
from
them
the
aspect
of
pretension
and
display
the
only
satisfactory
method
of
criticism
is
by
means
of
clinical
lectures
and
we
feel
regret
that
our
limits
do
not
suffer
us
to
any
great
degree
to
illustrate
what
we
deem
the
vigorous
simplicity
and
genuine
grace
of
morris
by
that
mode
of
exposition
we
must
refer
to
a
few
cases
however
to
show
what
we
have
been
meaning
in
the
remarks
which
we
made
above
upon
the
proper
character
of
the
song
the
ballad
of
woodman
spare
that
tree
one
of
those
accidents
of
genius
which
however
never
happen
but
to
consummate
artists
is
so
familiar
to
every
mind
and
heart
as
to
resent
citation
take
then
my
mother
bible
we
know
of
no
similar
production
in
a
truer
taste
in
a
purer
style
or
more
distinctly
marked
with
the
character
of
a
good
school
of
composition
or
take
we
were
boys
together
in
manly
pathos
in
tenderness
and
truth
where
shall
it
be
excelled
the
miniature
posses
the
captivating
elegance
of
voiture
where
hudson
wave
is
a
glorious
burst
of
poetry
modulated
into
refinement
by
the
hand
of
a
master
where
will
you
find
a
nautical
song
seemingly
more
spontaneous
in
its
genial
outbreak
really
more
careful
in
its
construction
than
how
full
of
the
joyous
madness
of
absolute
independence
yet
made
harmonious
by
instinctive
grace
is
life
in
the
west
that
the
same
heart
whose
wild
pulse
is
thrilled
by
the
adventurous
interests
of
the
huntsman
and
the
wanderer
can
beat
in
unison
with
the
gentlest
truth
of
deep
devotion
is
shown
in
when
other
friends
are
round
thee
i
love
the
night
has
the
voluptuous
elegance
of
the
spanish
models
were
we
to
meet
the
lines
oh
think
of
me
in
an
anthology
we
should
suppose
they
were
suckling
so
admirably
is
the
tone
of
feeling
kept
down
to
the
limit
of
probable
sincerity
which
is
a
characteristic
that
the
cavalier
style
of
courting
never
loses
the
star
of
love
might
stand
as
a
selected
specimen
of
all
that
is
most
exquisite
in
the
songs
of
the
trouveurs
the
seasons
of
love
is
a
charming
effusion
of
gay
yet
thoughtful
sentiment
the
song
i
never
have
been
false
to
thee
is
of
itself
sufficient
to
establish
general
fame
as
a
great
poet
as
a
potens
magister
affectuum
and
as
a
literary
creator
of
a
high
order
it
is
a
thoroughly
fresh
and
effective
poem
on
a
subject
as
hackneyed
as
the
highway
it
is
as
deep
as
truth
itself
yet
light
as
the
movement
of
a
dance
we
had
almost
forgotten
what
the
world
will
never
forget
the
matchless
softness
and
transparent
delicacy
of
near
the
lake
those
lines
of
themselves
unconsciously
court
the
soft
promoter
of
the
strain
and
almost
seem
about
to
break
into
music
it
is
agreeable
to
find
that
instead
of
being
seduced
into
a
false
style
by
the
excessive
popularity
which
many
of
his
songs
have
acquired
general
morris
later
efforts
are
in
a
vein
even
more
truly
classic
than
his
earlier
ones
and
show
a
decided
advance
both
in
power
and
ease
the
rock
of
the
pilgrims
and
the
indian
songs
are
a
very
clear
evidence
of
this
we
would
willingly
go
on
with
our
references
as
there
are
several
which
have
equal
claims
with
these
upon
our
notice
but
claudite
jam
rivos
such
are
some
of
the
compositions
original
in
style
natural
in
spirit
beautiful
with
the
charm
of
almost
faultless
execution
which
may
challenge
for
their
author
the
title
of
the
lauraete
of
america
a
writer
in
howitt
and
the
people
journal
furnishes
the
following
sketch
of
general
morris
and
his
songs
which
was
copied
and
endorsed
by
the
late
rufus
griswold
in
his
international
magazine
before
us
lies
a
heap
of
songs
and
ballads
the
production
of
the
rich
fancy
and
warm
heart
of
george
morris
not
many
weeks
since
at
a
public
meeting
in
london
a
gentleman
claimed
to
be
heard
speak
on
the
ground
of
his
connection
with
the
public
press
from
the
time
when
he
was
seven
years
of
age
we
will
not
undertake
to
say
that
general
morris
ran
his
juvenile
fingers
over
the
chords
of
the
lyre
at
so
very
early
a
period
but
it
is
certain
he
tried
his
hand
at
writing
for
the
newspapers
when
he
was
yet
but
a
mere
boy
while
in
his
teens
he
was
a
constant
contributor
to
various
periodicals
many
of
his
articles
attracted
notice
he
began
to
acquire
a
literary
reputation
and
at
length
in
being
then
in
his
twentieth
year
he
became
editor
of
the
york
mirror
this
responsible
post
he
continued
to
hold
until
the
termination
of
the
paper
existence
in
morris
accomplished
an
infinity
of
good
in
the
twenty
years
during
which
he
wielded
the
editorial
pen
perhaps
no
other
man
in
the
united
states
was
so
well
qualified
for
the
noble
task
he
set
himself
at
the
outset
of
his
career
as
editor
american
literature
was
in
its
infancy
and
subject
to
all
the
weaknesses
of
that
period
morris
resolved
to
do
his
utmost
toward
forming
a
character
for
it
and
looked
abroad
anxiously
for
such
as
could
aid
him
in
his
endeavor
the
will
ever
be
fondly
remembered
by
the
american
literary
man
for
it
has
been
the
cradle
of
american
genius
to
him
a
writer
in
magazine
attributes
the
present
flourishing
condition
and
bright
prospects
of
transatlantic
literature
he
evidently
possesses
a
personal
knowledge
of
general
morris
and
discourses
right
eloquently
in
his
praise
nor
do
we
think
that
he
overrates
his
merits
in
the
least
from
other
sources
we
have
ourselves
learned
much
of
the
genial
nature
of
george
morris
and
his
gigantic
labors
as
a
literary
pioneer
considering
its
juvenility
as
a
nation
republican
america
indeed
has
been
amazingly
prolific
of
good
writers
the
large
share
morris
has
had
in
awakening
the
latent
talent
of
his
countrymen
must
ever
be
to
him
a
high
source
of
gratulation
and
then
as
an
original
writer
he
has
won
for
himself
a
high
place
among
literary
americans
he
is
in
fact
known
throughout
the
states
as
songwriter
of
america
and
we
have
the
authority
of
willis
for
stating
that
people
out
of
a
hundred
take
them
as
they
come
in
the
census
would
find
more
to
admire
in
morris
songs
than
in
the
writings
of
any
other
american
poet
willis
also
tells
us
as
proof
of
the
popularity
with
those
shrewd
men
the
publishers
that
can
at
any
time
obtain
fifty
dollars
for
a
song
unread
when
the
whole
remainder
of
the
american
parnassus
could
not
sell
one
to
the
same
buyer
for
a
single
shilling
he
is
the
poet
of
the
country
by
acclamation
not
by
criticism
morris
seems
to
have
had
juster
notions
of
what
was
required
in
a
song
than
many
who
have
achieved
celebrity
as
in
england
just
office
and
notion
of
the
modern
song
has
been
defined
to
be
the
embodiment
and
expression
in
beauty
of
some
thought
or
sentiment
gay
pensive
moral
or
sentimental
which
is
as
natural
and
appropriate
in
certain
circumstances
as
the
odor
to
the
flower
its
graceful
purpose
is
to
exhibit
an
incident
in
the
substance
of
an
emotion
to
communicate
wisdom
in
the
form
of
sentiment
a
song
should
be
the
embodiment
of
some
general
feeling
and
have
reference
to
some
season
or
occurrence
it
is
not
a
difficult
thing
to
make
words
rhyme
some
of
the
most
unimaginative
intellects
we
ever
knew
could
do
so
with
surprising
facility
it
is
rare
to
find
a
sentimental
miss
or
a
lackadaisical
master
who
can
not
accomplish
this
intellectual
feat
with
the
help
of
walker
rhyming
dictionary
as
for
love
why
every
one
writes
about
it
there
is
such
an
abhorrence
of
the
simple
saxon
such
an
outrageous
running
after
outlandish
phraseology
that
we
wonder
folks
are
satisfied
with
this
plain
term
we
wonder
they
do
not
seek
for
an
equivalent
in
high
dutch
or
in
low
dutch
in
hungarian
or
in
hindostanee
we
wish
they
would
with
all
our
heart
and
soul
we
have
no
objection
provided
the
heart
be
touched
that
a
head
should
produce
a
little
of
the
stuff
called
verses
that
this
article
should
be
committed
to
scented
and
carefully
sealed
up
with
skewered
hearts
of
amazing
corpulence
god
forbid
that
we
should
be
thought
guilty
of
a
sneer
at
real
affection
far
from
it
such
ever
commands
our
reverence
but
we
do
not
find
it
in
the
noisy
tribe
of
goslings
green
who
would
fain
be
thought
of
the
nightingale
species
did
the
reader
ever
contemplate
a
child
engaged
in
the
interesting
operation
of
sucking
a
lollipop
we
assure
him
that
that
act
was
dictated
by
quite
as
much
of
true
sentiment
as
puts
in
action
the
fingers
and
wits
of
the
generality
of
our
young
amatory
poetasters
we
know
of
none
who
have
written
more
charmingly
of
love
than
george
morris
would
to
apollo
that
our
rhymsters
would
condescend
to
read
carefully
his
poetical
effusions
but
they
contain
no
straining
after
effect
no
extravagant
metaphors
no
driveling
conceits
and
so
there
is
little
fear
of
their
being
taken
as
models
by
those
gentlemen
let
the
reader
mark
the
surprising
excellence
of
the
love
songs
their
perfect
naturalness
the
quiet
beauty
of
the
similes
the
fine
blending
of
graceful
thought
and
tender
feeling
which
characterize
them
morris
is
indeed
the
poet
of
home
joys
none
have
described
more
eloquently
the
beauty
and
dignity
of
true
affection
of
passion
based
upon
esteem
and
his
fame
is
certain
to
endure
while
the
woman
has
a
hearthstone
over
which
to
repeat
her
most
cherished
household
words
seldom
have
the
benign
effects
of
the
passion
been
more
felicitously
painted
than
in
the
of
love
and
what
simple
tenderness
is
contained
in
the
ballad
of
were
boys
together
every
word
in
that
beautiful
melody
comes
home
to
the
heart
of
him
whose
early
days
have
been
happy
god
help
those
in
whom
this
poem
awakens
no
fond
remembrances
those
whose
memories
it
does
not
get
wandering
up
the
stream
of
life
toward
its
source
beholding
at
every
step
the
sun
smiling
more
brightly
the
heavens
assuming
a
deeper
hue
the
grass
a
fresher
green
and
the
flowers
a
sweeter
perfume
how
wondrous
are
not
its
effects
upon
ourselves
the
wrinkles
have
disappeared
from
our
brow
and
the
years
from
our
shoulder
and
the
marks
of
the
of
experience
from
our
heart
and
again
we
are
a
careless
child
gathering
primroses
and
chasing
butterflies
and
drinking
from
out
the
hollow
of
our
hands
around
us
are
the
hedges
golden
gorse
bright
blossoming
as
none
blossom
we
have
heard
of
death
but
we
know
not
what
it
is
and
the
word
change
has
no
meaning
for
us
and
summer
and
winter
and
and
harvest
has
each
its
unutterable
joys
alas
we
can
never
remain
long
in
this
happy
nevertheless
we
have
profited
greatly
by
the
journey
the
cowslips
and
violets
gathered
by
us
in
childhood
shall
be
potent
in
the
hour
of
temptation
and
the
cap
of
rushes
woven
for
us
by
kind
hands
in
days
gone
by
shall
be
a
surer
defence
than
a
helmet
of
steel
in
the
hour
of
battle
no
no
we
will
never
disgrace
our
antecedents
there
is
one
quality
in
his
songs
to
which
we
can
not
but
direct
attention
and
this
is
their
almost
feminine
purity
the
propensities
have
had
their
laureates
and
genius
alas
has
often
defiled
its
angel
wings
by
contact
with
the
sensual
and
the
impure
but
morris
has
never
attempted
to
robe
vice
in
beauty
and
as
has
been
well
remarked
his
lays
can
bring
to
the
cheek
of
purity
no
blush
save
that
of
pleasure
the
following
letter
from
the
pen
of
grace
greenwood
is
a
tribute
to
the
genius
of
the
poet
i
have
read
of
late
with
renewed
pleasure
and
higher
appreciation
the
songs
and
ballads
of
our
countryman
morris
i
had
previously
worried
myself
by
a
course
of
rather
dry
reading
and
his
poetry
tender
musical
fresh
and
natural
came
to
me
like
spring
first
sunshine
the
song
of
her
first
birds
the
breath
of
her
first
violets
what
a
contrast
is
this
pleasant
volume
to
the
festus
which
has
been
one
of
my
recent
passions
that
remarkable
work
has
passages
of
great
beauty
and
power
linked
in
unnatural
marriage
with
much
that
is
poor
and
weak
it
is
like
a
stately
ruined
palace
its
marble
with
the
dust
of
rome
or
it
is
like
its
own
fabled
first
temple
built
to
god
in
the
new
earth
a
multitude
of
gems
swallowed
by
an
earthquake
and
scattered
through
a
world
of
baser
matter
the
soul
of
the
reader
now
faints
with
excess
of
beauty
now
shudders
at
the
terrible
and
the
revolting
the
young
poet
muse
at
times
goes
like
proserpine
to
gather
flowers
but
straightway
is
seized
by
the
lord
of
the
infernal
regions
and
disappears
in
flame
and
darkness
the
entire
volume
is
a
poetical
archipelago
isles
of
loveliness
sprinkling
a
dead
sea
of
unprofitable
matter
it
were
absurd
to
compare
the
light
and
graceful
poems
of
morris
with
the
work
festus
a
simple
grecian
arch
with
a
stupendous
turkish
mosque
an
etruscan
vase
with
a
gothic
tower
yet
there
are
doubtless
many
who
will
prefer
the
perfect
realization
of
modest
aspirations
to
grand
but
ineffectual
graspings
after
glory
highest
and
most
divine
guerdons
a
quiet
walk
with
truth
and
nature
to
an
icarus
flight
of
magnificent
absurdities
it
has
been
said
that
the
author
of
time
ago
has
rung
too
many
changes
on
the
sentiment
and
passion
of
love
love
the
inspiration
of
the
glorious
bards
of
old
play
upon
the
heart
as
on
a
harp
and
make
our
eyes
bright
as
we
speak
of
them
everlasting
fresh
and
beautiful
now
as
when
the
silence
of
young
eden
was
thrilled
but
scarce
broken
by
the
voice
of
the
first
lover
a
joy
and
a
source
of
joy
for
ever
i
know
it
is
much
the
fashion
to
hold
in
lordly
contempt
many
of
those
sweet
and
holy
influences
which
are
angel
hands
enclosing
ours
leading
us
back
to
paradisean
bowers
love
and
liberty
are
fast
becoming
mere
abstractions
to
the
enlightened
apprehension
of
some
modern
wise
men
it
is
sad
to
see
how
soon
those
visitors
soil
their
plumage
and
change
their
very
nature
by
a
mere
descent
into
the
philosophic
atmosphere
of
such
mind
one
is
reminded
of
the
words
of
swedenborg
saw
a
great
truth
let
down
from
heaven
into
hell
and
it
there
became
a
lie
this
cynical
objection
to
the
lays
of
our
minstrel
surely
never
could
have
emanated
from
the
heart
of
woman
she
is
ever
loyal
to
love
that
tender
and
yearning
principle
in
the
bosom
of
the
father
from
which
and
by
which
the
feminine
nature
was
created
the
poems
of
morris
are
indeed
like
those
flowers
of
old
born
of
the
which
oozed
from
the
wounded
foot
of
the
queen
of
love
blushing
crimson
to
the
very
heart
yet
there
is
not
to
my
knowledge
in
the
whole
range
of
english
literature
so
large
a
collection
of
amatory
songs
in
which
sensualism
and
voluptuousness
find
no
voice
these
lays
can
bring
to
the
cheek
of
purity
no
blush
save
that
of
pleasure
the
mother
may
sing
them
to
her
child
the
bride
to
her
young
husband
has
an
eloquent
reply
to
such
as
hold
love
a
theme
unworthy
the
true
bard
are
all
who
love
who
feel
great
truths
and
tell
them
and
the
truth
of
truths
is
love
the
muse
of
morris
was
poesy
own
child
hope
love
and
happiness
fancies
and
imaginings
have
nested
in
his
heart
like
birds
his
verse
does
not
cause
one
to
tremble
and
turn
pale
it
charms
and
refreshes
it
does
not
us
like
a
passion
it
steals
upon
us
like
a
spell
it
does
not
storm
the
heart
like
an
armed
host
it
is
like
the
visitation
of
gentle
spirits
and
going
with
a
musical
lightness
it
is
not
a
turbulent
hurling
itself
down
rocky
places
it
is
a
silver
stream
gliding
through
quiet
valleys
in
whose
waves
the
sweet
stars
are
mirrored
on
whose
bosom
the
sleep
now
and
then
there
steals
in
a
strain
of
sadness
like
the
plaint
of
a
bereaved
bird
in
a
garden
of
roses
but
it
is
a
tender
not
an
oppresive
sadness
and
we
know
that
the
rainbow
beauty
of
the
verse
could
only
be
born
in
the
wedlock
of
smiles
and
tears
in
a
word
his
lays
are
not
and
storm
and
darkness
they
are
morning
and
music
and
sunshine
it
were
idle
at
this
time
to
quote
or
comment
upon
all
those
songs
of
morris
best
known
and
oftenest
sung
it
would
be
introducing
to
my
readers
old
friends
who
took
lodgings
in
their
memories
time
ago
in
reference
to
them
i
would
only
remark
their
peculiar
adaptedness
to
popular
taste
the
keen
discrimination
the
nice
tact
or
to
use
one
of
sir
james
mackintosh
happy
expressions
the
with
which
the
poet
has
interlaced
them
with
the
of
a
nation
rock
in
the
wilderness
is
an
ode
that
any
poet
might
be
proud
to
own
it
is
much
in
the
style
of
campbell
chaste
devotional
exceedingly
i
know
nothing
of
the
kind
more
musically
sweet
than
the
serenade
tis
now
the
promised
hour
the
first
line
in
especial
fountains
serenade
the
flowers
upon
their
silver
lute
and
nestled
in
their
leafy
bowers
the
forest
birds
are
mute
many
an
absent
lover
must
have
blessed
our
lyrist
for
giving
voice
to
his
own
yearning
affection
half
sad
with
that
delicate
jealousy
which
is
no
wrong
to
the
loved
one
in
the
song
other
friends
are
round
thee
bacchanal
if
our
language
boasts
a
lovelier
ballad
than
this
it
has
never
met
my
eye
the
story
of
the
winning
the
betraying
and
the
breaking
of
a
woman
heart
was
never
told
more
touchingly
dismissed
is
in
a
peculiar
vein
of
rich
and
quiet
humor
i
would
commend
it
to
the
entire
class
of
rejected
lovers
as
containing
the
truest
philosophy
after
the
manner
of
the
olden
time
remind
one
of
sir
john
suckling
they
are
with
love
their
subject
by
the
way
never
have
been
false
to
thee
was
an
emanation
from
the
feminine
nature
of
the
minstrel
alone
who
does
not
believe
the
poet
gifted
with
duality
of
soul
of
me
my
own
beloved
and
are
the
throbbings
of
a
lover
breast
set
to
music
and
balmy
summer
night
mary
heart
that
owns
thy
tyrant
sway
and
i
was
in
my
teens
the
distillation
of
the
subtlest
sweets
lodged
in
the
innermost
cells
of
all
flowers
dedicated
to
love
i
come
now
to
my
favorite
hudson
wave
a
poem
which
i
never
read
but
that
it
glows
upon
my
lip
and
heart
and
leaves
the
air
of
my
thoughts
tremulous
with
musical
vibrations
what
a
delicious
gush
of
parental
feeling
how
daintily
and
delicately
move
the
chose
words
tripping
along
like
silver
sandaled
fairies
and
the
refrain
thrill
one
gloriously
cottager
welcome
would
of
itself
carry
the
poet
name
to
the
next
age
and
the
ode
keep
his
bays
green
with
a
perpetual
baptism
the
is
fresh
and
sparkling
as
its
subject
and
displays
much
of
the
imaginative
faculty
a
merry
life
does
the
hunter
lead
rolled
up
the
tenth
wave
of
popularity
at
the
west
it
stirs
the
hunter
heart
like
a
bugle
blast
it
rings
out
clear
as
a
on
a
hunting
morning
general
morris
has
recently
published
some
songs
which
have
all
the
grace
melody
and
touching
sweetness
of
his
earlier
lays
but
as
these
have
been
artistically
set
to
music
and
are
yet
in
the
first
season
of
popularity
are
lying
on
the
pianos
and
over
the
bright
lip
of
all
they
call
for
no
further
mention
here
i
think
i
can
not
better
close
this
somewhat
broken
and
imperfect
notice
than
by
referring
to
one
of
the
earlier
songs
of
morris
which
more
than
all
others
perhaps
has
endeared
him
to
his
native
land
from
travel
is
a
simple
hearty
manly
embodiment
of
the
true
spirit
of
patriotism
a
sentiment
which
throbs
like
a
strong
pulse
beneath
our
poet
light
and
graceful
verse
and
needs
but
the
inspiration
of
times
to
prompt
to
deeds
of
heroic
valor
like
the
lays
of
the
ancient
bards
or
the
of
beranger
the
biography
of
morris
would
not
be
complete
without
a
word
from
willis
we
have
a
dash
of
his
pencil
in
the
following
letter
to
the
editor
of
graham
magazine
my
dear
sir
to
ask
me
for
my
idea
of
general
morris
is
like
asking
the
left
hand
opinion
of
the
dexterity
of
the
right
i
have
lived
so
long
with
the
know
him
so
intimately
worked
so
constantly
at
the
same
rope
and
thought
so
little
of
ever
separating
from
him
except
by
precedence
of
ferriage
over
the
styx
that
it
is
hard
to
shove
him
from
me
to
the
perspective
distance
hard
to
shut
my
own
partial
eyes
and
look
at
him
through
other
people
i
will
try
however
and
as
it
is
done
with
but
one
foot
off
from
the
treadmill
of
my
ceaseless
vocation
you
will
excuse
both
abruptness
and
brevity
morris
is
the
poet
of
the
country
by
acclamation
not
by
criticism
he
is
just
what
poets
would
be
if
they
sang
like
birds
without
criticism
and
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
his
fame
that
it
seems
as
regardless
of
criticism
as
a
bird
in
the
air
nothing
can
stop
a
song
of
his
it
is
very
easy
to
say
that
they
are
easy
to
do
they
have
a
momentum
somehow
that
it
is
difficult
for
others
to
give
and
that
speeds
them
to
the
far
goal
of
popularity
the
best
proof
consisting
in
the
fact
that
he
can
at
any
moment
get
fifty
dollars
for
a
song
unread
when
the
whole
remainder
of
the
american
parnassus
could
not
sell
one
to
the
same
buyer
for
a
shilling
it
may
or
may
not
be
one
secret
of
his
popularity
but
it
is
the
truth
that
morris
heart
is
at
the
level
of
most
other
people
and
his
poetry
flows
out
by
that
door
he
stands
in
the
common
stream
of
sympathy
and
the
fine
oil
of
his
poetic
feeling
goes
from
him
upon
an
element
it
is
its
nature
to
float
upon
and
which
carries
it
safe
to
other
bosoms
with
little
need
of
deep
diving
or
high
flying
his
sentiments
are
simple
honest
truthful
and
familiar
his
language
is
pure
and
eminently
musical
and
he
is
prodigally
full
of
the
poetry
of
feeling
these
are
days
when
poets
try
experiments
and
while
others
succeed
by
taking
the
world
breath
away
with
flights
and
plunges
morris
uses
his
feet
to
walk
quietly
with
nature
people
in
a
hundred
taken
as
they
come
in
the
census
would
find
more
to
admire
in
morris
songs
than
in
the
writings
of
any
other
american
poet
and
that
is
a
parish
in
the
poetical
episcopate
well
worthy
a
wise
man
nurture
and
prizing
as
for
the
man
morris
my
friend
i
can
hardly
venture
to
incense
on
his
moustache
as
the
french
say
write
his
praises
under
his
very
nose
but
as
far
off
as
philadelphia
you
may
pay
the
proper
tribute
to
his
loyal
nature
and
manly
excellencies
his
personal
qualities
have
made
him
universally
popular
but
this
overflow
upon
the
world
does
not
impoverish
him
for
his
friends
i
have
outlined
a
true
poet

a
fine
fellow

up

your
liking

in

joined

general
morris
is
still
in
the
prime
and
vigor
of
life
and
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
public
will
yet
have
much
to
admire
from
his
pen
and
which
will
without
doubt
place
him
still
higher
in
the
niche
of
fame
his
residence
is
chiefly
at
undercliff
his
country
seat
on
the
banks
of
the
hudson
near
cold
spring
surrounded
by
the
most
lovely
and
beautiful
scenery
in
nature
which
can
not
fail
to
keep
the
muse
alive
within
him
and
tune
the
minstrel
to
further
and
still
higher
efforts
although
he
possesses
abilities
which
eminently
qualify
him
for
public
station
his
literary
taste
and
habits
have
in
spite
of
the
strenuous
solicitations
of
his
friends
led
him
to
prefer
the
retirement
of
private
life
this
however
does
not
prevent
his
taking
an
active
interest
in
all
questions
of
public
good
and
the
city
of
new
york
is
greatly
indebted
to
his
vigorous
aid
for
many
of
her
most
beautiful
and
permanent
improvements

can
not
close
this
sketch
without
adverting
to
the
following
incident
which
occurred
in
the
british
house
of
commons
cagley
a
member
from
yorkshire
says
the
london

concluded
a
long
speech
in
favor
of

by
quoting
the
ballad
of

was
received
with
applause
of
the
whole

according
to
cagley
being

a
nautical
ballad
founded
upon
a
tale
from
the
pen
of
the
late
william
leggett
esq
old
ironsides
at
anchor
lay
in
the
harbor
of
mahon
a
dead
calm
rested
on
the
bay
the

to
sleep
had
gone
when
little
jack
the
captain
son
with
gallant
hardihood
climbed
shroud
and
spar
and
then
upon
the
rose
and
stood
a
shudder
ran
through
every
vein
all
eyes
were
turned
on
high
there
stood
the
boy
with
dizzy
brain
between
the
sea
and
sky
no
hold
had
he
above
below
alone
he
stood
in
air
at
that
far
height
none
dared
to
go
no
aid
could
reach
him
there
we
gazed
but
not
a
man
could
speak
with
horror
all
aghast
in
groups
with
pallid
brow
and
cheek
we
watched
the
quivering
mast
the
atmosphere
grew
thick
and
hot
and
of
a
lurid
hue
as
riveted
unto
the
spot
stood
officers
and
crew
the
father
came
on
deck
he
gasped
o
god
thy
will
be
done
then
suddenly
a
rifle
grasped
and
aimed
it
at
his
son
jump
far
out
boy
into
the
wave

or
i
fire
he
said
that
only
chance

jump
boy
he
obeyed
he
sank
he
rose
he
lived
he
moved
he
for
the
ship
struck
out
on
board
we
hailed
the
lad
beloved
with
many
a
manly
shout
his
father
drew
in
silent
joy
those
wet
arms
round
his
neck
then
folded
to
his
heart
the

and
fainted

read
it

running
brook
that
sings
its
way
toward
the
sea
it
whispers
in
the
leaves
of

the
swelling
grain
the
waving
grass

that
crisps
the

as
they
pass
the
flowers

to
the
where
sport
beneath
the
waves
love
vibrates
in
the
tune
with
fays
and
oreads
lingers
he
gleams
in
th
ring
of
the
watery
moon
or
treads
the
pebbles
of
the
sea
love
rules
the
court
the
camp
the
grove
oh
everywhere
we
meet
thee
love
and
everywhere
he
welcome
finds
from
to
love
enters
free
as
spicy
winds
with
purple
wings
and
lighted
torch
with
tripping
feet
and
silvery
tongue
and
bow
and
darts
behind
him
slung
he
tinkles
in
the
shepherd
bell
the
village
maiden
leans
to
hear
by
lattice
high
he
weaves
his
spell
for
lady
fair
and
cavalier
like
on
the
mountain
snow
love
genial
warmth
melts
high
and
low
then
why
ye
nymphs
arcadian
why
since
love
is
general
as
the
air
why
does
he
not
to
lelia
fly
and
soften
the
obdurate
fair
scorn
nerves
her
proud
disdainful
heart
she
scoffs
at
love
and
all
his
art
oh
love
an
archer
thou
thy
utmost
skill
i
fain
would
test
one
arrow
aim
at
lelia
now
and
let
thy
target
be
her
breast
her
heart
bind
in
thy
captive
train
or
give
me
back
my
own
again
the
dream
of
love
i
had
the
many
times
at
the
mere
mention
of
a
name
i
never
woven
in
my
rhymes
though
from
it
inspiration
came
it
is
in
truth
a
holy
thing
from
the
world
apart
a
dove
that
never
tries
its
wing
but
broods
and
nestles
in
the
heart
that
name
of
melody
recalls
her
gentle
look
and
winning
ways
whose
portrait
hangs
on
memory
walls
in
the
fond
light
of
other
days
in
the
of
poetry
reclining
in
its
leafy
bowers
her
bright
eyes
in
the
stars
i
see
and
her
sweet
semblance
in
the
flowers
her
artless
dalliance
and
grace
the
joy
that
lighted
up
her
brow
the
sweet
expression
of
her
face
her
form
it
stands
before
me
now
and
i
can
fancy
that
i
hear
the
woodland
songs
she
used
to
sing
which
stole
to
my
attending
ear
like
the
first
harbingers
of
spring
the
beauty
of
the
earth
was
hers
and
hers
the
purity
of
heaven
alone
of
all
her
worshippers
to
me
her
maiden
vows
were
given
they
little
know
the
human
heart
who
think
such
love
with
time
expires
once
kindled
it
will
depart
but
burn
through
life
with
all
its
fires
we
parted
doomed
no
more
to
meet
the
blow
fell
with
a
stunning
power
and
yet
my
pulse
will
strangely
beat
at
the
remembrance
of
that
hour
but
time
and
change
their
healing
brought
and
years
have
passed
in
seeming
glee
but
still
alone
of
her
i
thought
who
now
a
memory
to
me
there
may
be
many
who
will
deem
this
strain
a
wayward
youthful
folly
to
be
derided
as
a
dream
born
of
the
poet
melancholy
the
wealth
of
worlds
if
it
were
mine
with
all
that
follows
in
its
train
i
would
with
gratitude
resign
to
dream
that
dream
of
love
again
i
with
you
once
again
i
with
you
once
again
my
friends
no
more
my
footsteps
roam
where
it
began
my
journey
ends
amid
the
scenes
of
home
no
other
clime
has
skies
so
blue
or
streams
so
broad
and
clear
and
where
are
hearts
so
warm
and
true
as
those
that
meet
me
here
since
last
with
spirits
wild
and
free
i
pressed
my
native
strand
i
wandered
many
miles
at
sea
and
many
miles
on
land
i
seen
fair
realms
of
the
earth
by
rude
commotion
torn
which
taught
me
how
to
prize
the
worth
of
that
where
i
was
born
in
other
countries
when
i
heard
the
language
of
my
own
how
fondly
each
familiar
word
awoke
an
answering
tone
but
when
our
woodland
songs
were
sung
upon
a
foreign
mart
the
vows
that
faltered
on
the
tongue
with
rapture
thrilled
the
heart
my
native
land
i
turn
to
you
with
blessing
and
with
prayer
where
man
is
brave
and
woman
true
and
free
as
mountain
air
long
may
our
flag
in
triumph
wave
against
the
world
combined
and
friends
a
welcome

a
grave
within
our
borders

oh
would
that
she
were
here
oh
would
that
she
were
here
these
hills
and
dales
among
where
vocal
groves
are
gayly
mocked
by
echo
airy
tongue
where
jocund
nature
smiles
in
all
her
boon
attire
and
roams
the
wilds
of
hawthorn

oh
would
that
she
were
here
the
gentle
maid
i
sing
whose
voice
is
cheerful
as
the
songs
of
in
spring
oh
would
that
she
were
here
where
the
free
waters
leap
shouting
in
sportive
joyousness
adown
the
rocky
steep
where
zephyrs
crisp
and
cool
the
fountains
as

play
with
health

the
morning
sky
when
home
the
belle
again
returned
with
throbbing
pulse
and
brain
flushed
cheek
and
tearful
eye
the
plume
that
danced
above
her
brow
the
gem
that
sparkled
in
her
zone
the
scarf
of
spangled
leaf
and
bough
were
laid
aside
they
mocked
her
now
when
desolate
and
lone
that
night
how
many
hearts
she
won
the
reigning
belle
she
could
not
stir
but
like
the
planets
round
the
sun
her
suitors
followed
all
but
one
one
all
the
world
to
her
and
she
had
lost
him
marvel
not
that
lady
eyes
with
tears
were
wet

love
by
man
is
soon
forgot
it
never
yet
was

lot
to
love

we
were
boys
together
and
never
can
forget
the
near
the
heather
in
childhood
where
we
met
the
humble
home
to
memory
dear
its
sorrows
and
its
joys
where
woke
the
transient
smile
or
tear
when
you
and
i
were
boys
we
were
youths
together
and
castles
built
in
air
your
heart
was
like
a
feather
and
mine
weighed
down
with
care
to
you

the

we
loved
of

with

of
autumn

are
gone
for

how
blest
to

the
impulse
given
the
hope
time
destroys
which
led
our
thoughts
from
earth
to

i

answer
and
say
the
spirit
of
man
never
dies
his
body
which
came
from

earth
must
mingle
again
with
the
sod
but
his
soul
which
in

had
birth
returns
to
the

of

no
terror
has
death
or
the
grave
to
those
who
believe
in

we

the

be
burnt
as

the
earth
wrapped
in
flames
will
expire

freed

all
shackles
the

will
rise
in

brothers
mourn
not

the

to

we

i
miss
thee
from

and
all
its
fleeting
joys
to
me
are
worse
than
vain
until

and
the
we
used
to
thread
of
yore
with
bird
and
bee
have
flown
with
thee
and
gone
for
ever
more
there
is
no
music
in
the
grove
no
echo
on
the
hill
but
melancholy
boughs
are
there
and
hushed
the
i
miss
thee
in
the
town
beloved
i
miss
thee
in
the
town
from
morn
i
grieve
till
dewy
eve
spreads
wide
its
mantle
brown
my
spirit
wings
that
once
could
soar
in
fancy
world
of

are
crushed
and
beaten
to
the
ground
by
care
no
more
i
hear
thy
thrilling
voice
nor
see
thy
winning
face
that
once
would
gleam
like
morning
beam
in
mental
pride
and
grace
thy
form
of
matchless
symmetry
in
sweet
perfection
cast
is
now
the
star
of
memory
that
fades
not
with
the

i
miss
thee
everywhere
beloved
i
miss
thee
everywhere
both
night
and

wear
dull
away
and
leave
me
in
despair
the
the
play
the
ball
and
childhood
sportive
glee

lost
their

for
me
beloved
my

is
full
of

forgotten
me
and

i
now
in
vain
if
that
be
so
my
heart
can
know
no
rest
on
earth
again
a
sad
and
weary
lot
is
mine
to
love
and
be
forgot

lot
beloved
a
sad
and
weary
lot
the

the
heart
that
owns
thy
tyrant

a
bark
that
drifts
away
upon
a
shoreless
sea
no
compass
left
to
guide
her
on
upon
the
surge
she
and
such
is
life
to
me
and
what
is
life
when
love
is
fled
the
world
unshared
by
thee
i
rather
slumber
with
the
dead
than
such
a
waif
to
be
the
bark
that
by
no

steers
is
lost
which
way
she
veers
and
such
is
life
to
me
a

let
not

be
shed
of

not

in
the
tomb
where
files
of
veterans
come
with
martial
tramp
and
muffled

give
to
the

his

to
moulder
and
decay
but
not
his
deathless

rhyme
and
reason
an
apologue
two
children
of
the
olden
time
in
flora
primrose
season
were
born
the
name
of
one
was
rhyme
that
of
the
other
reason
and
both
were
beautiful
and
fair
and
pure
as
mountain
stream
and
air
as
the
boys
together
grew
happy
fled
their
hours
grief
or
care
they
never
knew
in
the
paphian
bowers
see
them
roaming
hand
in
hand
the
pride
of
all
the
choral
band
music
with
harp
of
golden
strings
love
with
bow
and
quiver
airy
sprites
on
radiant
wings
nymphs
of
wood
and
river
joined
the
muses
constant
song
as
rhyme
and
reason
passed
along
but
the
scene
was
changed
the
boys
left
their
native
soil
rhyme
pursuit
was
idle
joys
reason
manly
toil
soon
rhyme
was
starving
in
a
ditch
while
reason
grew
exceeding
rich
since
the
dark
and
fatal
hour
when
the
brothers
parted
reason
has
had
wealth
and
power
rhyme
poor
and
and
now
or
bright
or
stormy
weather
they
twain
are
seldom
seen
together
starlight
recollections
was
night
near
the
murmuring
saone
we
met
with
no
witnesses
by
but
such
as
resplendently
shone
in
the
vault
of
the
sky
your
head
on
my
bosom
was
laid
as
you
said
you
would
ever
be
mine
and
i
promised
to
love
dearest
maid
and
worship
alone
at
your
shrine
your
love
on
my
heart
gently
fell
as
the
dew
on
the
flowers
at
eve
whose
blossoms
with
gratitude
swell
a
blessing
to
give
and
receive
and
i
knew
by
the
glow
on
your
cheek
and
the
rapture
you
could
not
control
no
power
had
language
to
speak
the
faith
or
content
of
your
soul
i
love
you
as
none
ever
loved
as
the
steel
to
the
star
i
am
true
and
i
dearest
maiden
have
proved
that
none
ever
loved
me
but
you
till
memory
loses
her
power
or
the
sands
of
existence
have
run
i
remember
the
hour
that
mingled
two
hearts
into
one
wearies
my
love
wearies
my
love
of
my
letters
does
she
my
silence
command
sunders
she
love
rosy
fetters
as
though
they
were
woven
of
sand
tires
she
too
of
each
token
indited
with
many
a
sigh
are
all
her
promises
broken
and
must
i
love
on
till
i
die
thinks
my
dear
love
that
i
blame
her
with
what
was
a
burden
to
part
ah
no
with
affection
i
name
her
while
lingers
a
pulse
in
my
heart
although
she
has
clouded
with
sadness
and
blighted
the
bloom
of
my
years
i
lover
still
even
to
madness
and
bless
her
through
showers
of
tears
my
pen
i
have
laid
down
in
sorrow
the
songs
of
my
lute
i
forego
from
neither
assistance
i
borrow
to
utter
my
wo
but
peace
to
her
bosom
wherever
her
thoughts
or
her
footsteps
may
stray
memento
of
mine
again
never
will
shadow
the
light
of
her
way
fare
the
well
love
fare
thee
well
love
we
must
sever
nor
for
years
love
but
for
ever
we
must
meet
no
more
or
only
meet
as
strangers
sad
and
lonely
fare
thee
well
fare
thee
well
love
how
i
languish
for
the
cause
of
all
my
anguish
none
have
ever
met
and
parted
so
forlorn
and
fare
thee
well
fare
thee
well
love
till
i
perish
all
my
truth
for
thee
i
cherish
and
when
thou
my
requiem
hearest
know
till
death
i
loved
thee
dearest
fare
thee
well
thou
hast
woven
the
spell
thou
hast
woven
the
spell
that
hath
bound
me
through
all
the
sad
changes
of
years
and
the
smiles
that
i
wore
when
i
found
thee
have
faded
and
melted
in
tears
like
the
poor
wounded
fawn
from
the
mountain
that
seeks
out
the
clear
silver
tide
i
have
lingered
in
vain
at
the
fountain
of
hope
with
a
shaft
in
my
side
thou
hast
taught
me
that
love
rosy
fetters
a
pang
from
the
thorns
may
impart
that
the
coinage
of
vows
and
of
letters
comes
not
from
the
mint
of
the
heart
like
the
lone
bird
that
flutters
her
pinion
and
warbles
in
bondage
her
strain
i
have
struggled
to
fly
thy
domain
but
find
that
the
struggle
is
vain
bessy
bell
when
life
looks
drear
and
lonely
love
and
pleasant
fancies
flee
then
will
the
muses
only
love
bestow
a
thought
on
me
mine
is
a
harp
which
pleasure
love
to
waken
strives
in

to

and
other
hearts
are
thine
when
other
bays

crowned
thee
more
fresh
and
green
than
mine
then

how
sad
and
lonely
this
doating
heart
will
be
which
while

the
start
that
guides
me
along
life
troubled
sea
and
whatever
fate
betides
me
this
heart
still
turns
to
thee
silent
grief
where
is
now
my
peace
of
mind
gone
alas
for
evermore
turn
i
may
i
find
thorns
where
roses
bloomed
before
the
of
my
soul
where
the
springs
of
joy
were
found
now
the
clouds
of
sorrow
roll
shading
all
the
prospect
round
do
i
merit
pangs
like
these
that
have
cleft
my
heart
in
twain
must
i
to
the
very
lees
drain
thy
bitter
chalice
pain
silent
grief
all
grief
excels
life
and
it
together
part
like
a
restless
worm
it
dwells
deep
within
the
human
heart
love
thee
dearest
love
thee
dearest
hear

will
my
fond
vows
be

from
me

to
do
with
tears
dry
them

ah
believe
me
love
bright
flame
is
burning
still
though
the
hollow
world
deceive
thee
here
a
heart
that

will
dost
thou
smile
a
cloud
of
sorrow
breaks
before
joy
rising
sun
wilt
thou
give
thy
hand
hymen

make
us
one
i
love
the
night
i
love
the
night
when
the
moon
streams
bright
on
flowers
that
drink
the
dew
when
cascades
shout
as
the
stars
peep
out
from
boundless
fields
of
blue
but
dearer
far
than
moon
or
star
or
flowers
of
gaudy
hue

murmuring
trills
of

you
i
love
to
stray
at
the
close
of
the
day
through
groves
of
when
gushing
notes
from
throats
are
vocal
in

i
love
the
night
the
glorious
night

hearts
beat

the
miniature
william
was
holding
in
his
hand
the
likeness
of
his
wife
fresh
as
if
touched
by
fairy
wand
with
beauty
grace
and
life
he
almost
thought
it
spoke
he
gazed
upon
the
bauble
still
absorbed
delighted
and
amazed
to
view
the
artist
skill
this
picture
is
yourself
dear
jane
is
drawn
to
nature
true
i
kissed
it
and
again
it
is
much
like
you
and
has
it
kissed
you
back
my
dear
why
no
my
love
said
he
then
william
it
is
very
clear
is
not
at
all
like
me
the
retort
old
nick
who
taught
the
wedded
a
maid
of
homespun
habit
he
was
as
stubborn
as
a
mule
she
was
as
playful
as
a
rabbit
poor
jane
had
scarce
become
a
wife
before
her
husband
sought
to
make
her
the
pink
of
life
and
prim
and
formal
as
a
quaker
one
day
the
tutor
went
abroad
and
simple
jenny
sadly
missed
him
when
he
returned
behind
her
lord
she
slyly
stole
and
fondly
kissed
him
the
husband
anger
rose
and
red
and
white
his
face
alternate
grew
less
freedom
jane
sighed
and
said
oh
dear
i
did
know
was
you
lines
on
a
poet
how
sweet
the
cadence
of
his
lyre
what
melody
of
words
they
strike
a
pulse
within
the
heart
like
songs
of
or
tinkling
of
the
shepherd
bell
among
the
his
mind
a
cultured
garden
where
nature
hand
has
sown
the
of
poesy
and
they
have
freshly
grown
imbued
with
beauty
and
perfume
to
other
plants
unknown
a
bright
career
before
him
all
tongues
pronounce
his
praise
all
hearts
his
inspiration
feel
and
will
in
for
genius
breathes
in
every
line
of
his
lays
a
nameless
grace
is
round
him
a
something
too
refined
to
be
described
yet
must
be
felt
by
all
of
human
kind
an
emanation
of
the
soul
that
can
not
be
defined
then
blessings
on
the
minstrel
his
faults
let
others
scan
there
may
be
spots
upon
the
sun
which
those
may
view
who
can
i
see
them
not
yet
know
him
well
a
poet
and
a
man
the
bacchanal
beside
a
sang
ella
at
her
wheel
ruthven
rode
the
moor
down
at
her
feet
to
kneel
a
spotted
palfrey
gay
came
ambling
at
his

to
bear
the

away
as
his
affianced
bride
a
noble

of
stately
halls
secure
a
peasant
she
of
parentage
obscure
how
soft
the
honeyed
words
he
breathes
into
her
ears
the
melody
of
birds
the
music
of
the
spheres
with
love
her
bosom
swells
which
she
would
fain
conceal
her
eyes
like
crystal
wells
its
hidden
depths
reveal
while
liquid
diamonds
drip
from
feeling
fountain
warm
flutters
her
scarlet
lip
a
in
a
storm
as
from
an

sky
the
flit
away
so
from
the
maiden
eye
vanished
the
falling
spray
which
lingered
but
awhile
her
dimpled
cheek
upon
then
melted
in
her
smile
like
vapor
in
the
sun
the
maid
is
all
his
own
she
trusts
his
plighted
word
and
lightly
on
the
roan
she
springs
beside
her
lord
she
leaves
her

she
turns
her
from
the
door
that
green
and
holy
spot

she
will

their
hands
for

was
betrayed
torn
from
her
native
bower
that
modest
rose
of
may
drooped
in
his
stately
tower
and
passed
from
earth
away
they
laid
her
in
the
ground
and
ella
was
forgot
dead
was
her
father
found
in
his
deserted
cot
but
ruthven
what
of
him
he
ran
the
story
and
filling
to
the
brim
he
thought
of
it
no
more
twenty
years
ago
in
the
flush
of
some
twenty
years
or
more
when
ernest
lost
his
way
and
crossed
the
threshold
of
our

his
locks
of

his
brow
of
alpine
snow
his
manly
grace
of
form
and

some
twenty
years
ago
the

a
happy
lot
in

never

was
ours
when
love
dispelled
the
clouds
of
care
and
time
went
by
with
birds
and
flowers
while
song
and
incense
filled
the

love
look
from
thy
lattice
love
listen
to
me
the
cool
balmy
breeze
is
abroad
on
the
sea
the
moon
like
a
queen
roams
her
realms
above
and
naught
is
awake
but
the
spirit
of
love
ere
morn
golden
light
tips
the
hills
with
its
ray
away
the
waters
away
and
away
then
look
from
thy
lattice

listen
to
me
while
the

lights
the

and
the

curls
the

at

by
the
he

above
his

cut
the

she
loved
him
she
loved
him
but
she
heeded
not
her
heart
had
only
room
for
pride
all
other
feelings
were
forgot
when
she
became
another
bride
as
from
a
dream
she
then
awoke
to
realize
her
lonely
state
and
own
it
was
the
vow
she
broke
that
made
her
drear
and
desolate
she
loved
him
but
the
came
with
words
of
hate
that
all
believed
a
stain
thus
rested
on
his
name
but
he
was
wronged
and
she
deceived
ah
rash
the
act
that
gave
her
hand
that
drove
her
lover
from
her
side
who
hied
him
to
a
distant
land
where
battling
for
a
name
he
died
she
loved
him
and
his
memory
now
was
treasured
from
the
world
apart
the
calm
of
thought
was
on
her
brow
the
seeds
of
death
were
in
her
heart
for
all
the
world
that
thing
forlorn
i
would
not
could
not
be
and
live
that
casket
with
its
jewel
gone
a
bride
who
has
no
heart
to
give
the
suitors
wealth
sought
the
bower
of
beauty
dressed
like
a
modern
beau
just
then
love
health
and
duty
took
up
their
hats
to
go
wealth
such
a
cordial
welcome
met
as
made
the
others
grieve
so
duty
shunned
the
gay
coquette
love
pouting
took
french
leave
he
did
love
pouting
took
french
leave
old
time
the
friend
of
duty
next
called
to
see
the
fair
he
laid
his
hand
on
beauty
and
left
her
in
despair
wealth
vanished
last
went
rosy
health
and
she
was
doomed
to
prove
that
those
who
duty
slight
for
wealth
can
never
hope
for

ah
no
can
never

agnes

before

a
true
knight
from

came
a
gentle
round
his

a
silken
string

words
the
warrior
writ
at

he
stooped
his
wing
and
upon
her

she
like

enchanted
pored
the
contents
of

for
that
lady
loved
her

with

pure
devoted
soul

the
prairie
on
fire
see
notes
the
shades
of
evening
closed
around
the
boundless
prairies
of
the
west
as
grouped
in
sadness
on
the
ground
a
band
of
pilgrims
leaned
to
rest
upon
the
tangled
weeds
were
laid
the
mother
and
her
youngest
born
who
slept
while
others
watched
and
prayed
and
thus
the
weary
night
went
on
thick
darkness
shrouded
earth
and
sky
when
on
the
whispering
winds
there
came
the
teton
shrill
and
thrilling
cry
and
heaven
was
pierced
with
shafts
of
flame
the
sun
seemed
rising
through
the
haze
but
with
an
aspect
dread
and
dire
the
very
air
appeared
to
blaze
o
god
the
prairie
was
on
fire
around
the
centre
of
the
plain
a
belt
of
flame
retreated
denied
and
like
a
furnace
glowed
the
train
that
walled
them
in
on
every
side
and
onward
rolled
the
torrent
wild
wreathes
of
dense
smoke
obscured
the
sky
the
mother
knelt
beside
her
child
and
all
save
one
shrieked
out
we
die
not
so
he
help
clear
the
sedge
strip
bare
a
circle
to
the
land
that
done
he
hastened
to
its
edge
and
grasped
a
rifle
in
his
hand
dried
weeds
he
held
beside
the
pan
which
kindled
at
a
flash
the
mass
now
fire
fight
fire
he
said
as
ran
the
forked
flames
among
the
grass
on
three
sides
then
the
torrent
flew
but
on
the
fourth
no
more
it
raved
then
large
and
broad
the
circle
grew
and
thus
the
pilgrim
band
was
saved
the
flames
receded
far
and
wide
the
mother
had
not
prayed
in
vain
god
had
the
teton
arts
defied
his
scythe
of
fire
had
swept
the
plain
the
evergreen
love
can
not
be
the
whose
bloom
but
once
is
seen
go
search
the
grove
the
tree
of
love
is
sure
the
evergreen
for
that
the
same
in
leaf
or
frame
cold
or
sunny
skies
you
take
the
ground
its
roots
have
bound
or
it
transplanted
dies
that
love
thus
shoots
and
firmly
roots
in
woman
heart
we
see
through
smiles
and
tears
in
it
grows
a
fadeless
tree
the
tree
of
love
all
trees
above
for
ever
may
be
seen
in
summer
bloom
or
winter
gloom
a
hardy
evergreen
the
like
flights
of
went
by
the
cheerful
hours
of
girlhood
day
when
in
my
native
bowers
of
simple
buds
and
flowers
they
wove
a
crown
and
hailed
me
queen
of
may
like
airy
sprites
the
lasses
came
spring
offerings
at
my
feet
to
lay
the
crystal
from
the
fountain
the
green
bough
from
the
mountain
they
brought
to
cheer
and
shade
the
queen
of
may
around
the
on
the
green
a
fairy
ring
they
tripped
away
all
merriment
and
pleasure
to
chords
of
tuneful
measure
they
bounded
by
the
happy
queen
of
may
though
years
have
passed
and
time
has
strown
my
raven
locks
with
flakes
of
gray
fond
memory
brings
the
hours
of
buds
and
when
in
girlhood
i
was
crowned
the
queen
of
may
venetian
serenade
come
come
to
me
love
come
love
arise
and
shame
the
bright
stars
with
the
light
of
thine
eyes
look
out
from
thy
lattice
oh
hear
a
swan
on
the
water
my
gondola
near
come
come
to
me
love
come
love
my
bride
crystal
in
moonbeams
we
tranquilly
glide
in
the
dip
of
the
oar
a
melody
flows
sweet
as
the
nightingale
sings
to
the
rose
come
come
to
me
love
come
love
the
day
brings
warder
and
cloister
away
then
away
oh
haste
to
thy
lover
not
yon
star
above
is
more
true
to
heaven
then
he
to
his
love
the
the
plaint
of
the
wailing
who
mourns
unseen
and
ceaseless
sings
ever
a
note
of
wail
and
wo
till
morning
spreads
her
rosy
wings
and
earth
and

in
her
glances

of
me
to
whip

poor

the
deadliest
sin
on

as
he
deserves
who
shall
whipping
none
farewell
poor
will
not
valueless
this
lesson
by
thee
given
keep
thine
own
counsel
and
confess
thyself
alone
to
heaven
the
exile
to
his
sister
as
streams
at
morn
from
seas
that
glide
rejoicing
on
their
sparkling
way
will
turn
again
at
eventide
to
mingle
with
their
kindred
spray
even
so
the
currents
of
the
soul
dear
sister
we
rove
will
backward
to
our
country
roll
the
boundless
ocean
of
our
love
you
northern
star
now
burning
bright
the
guide
by
which
the
steer
beams
not
with
a
more
constant
light
than
does
thy
love
my
sister
dear
from
stars
above
the
streams
below
receive
the
glory
they
impart
so
sister
do
thy
virtues
glow
within
the
mirror
of
my
heart
near
the
lake
near
the
lake
where
drooped
the
willow
long
time
ago
where
the
rock
threw
back
the
billow
brighter
than
snow
dwelt
a
maid
beloved
and
cherished
by
high
and
low
but
with
autumn
leaf
she
perished
long
time
ago
rock
and
tree
and
flowing
water
long
time
ago
bee
and
bird
and
blossom
taught
her
love
spell
to
know
while
to
my
fond
words
she
listened
murmuring
low
tenderly
her
glistened
long
time
ago
mingled
were
our
hearts
for
ever
long
time
ago
can
i
now
forget
her
never
no
lost
one
no
to
her
grave
these
tears
are
given
ever
to
flow
she
the
star
i
missed
from
heaven
long
time
ago
the
pastor
daughter
an
cottage
smiled
near
a
streamlet
side
where
dwelt
the
child
in
all
her
maiden
bloom
and
pride
proud
suitors
paid
their
court
and
duty
to
this
romantic
sylvan
beauty
yet
none
of
all
the
swains
who
sought
her
was
worthy
of
the
pastor
daughter
the
crossed
hill
and
plain
to
seek
the
groves
of
her
retreat
and
many
followed
in
her
train
to
lay
their
riches
at
her
feet
but
still
for
all
their
arts
so
wary
from
home
they
could
not
lure
the
fairy
a
maid
without
a
heart
they
thought
her
and
so
they
left
the
pastor
daughter
one
balmy
eve
in
dewy
spring
a
bard
became
her
father
guest
he
struck
his
harp
and
every
string
to
love
vibrated
in
her
breast
with
that
true
faith
which
can
not
falter
her
hand
was
given
at
the
alter
and
faithful
was
the
heart
he
brought
her
to
wedlock
and
the
pastor
daughter
how
seldom
learn
the
worldly
gay
with
all
their
sophistry
and
art
the
sweet
and
gentle
to
woman
fond
devoted
heart
they
seek
but
never
find
the
treasure
revealed
in
eyes
of
jet
and
azure
to
them
like
truth
in
wells
of
water
a
fable
is
the
pastor
daughter
margaretta
when
i
was
in
my
teens
i
loved
dear
margaretta
i
know
not
what
it
means
i
can
not
now
forget
her
that
vision
of
the
past
my
head
is
ever
crazing
yet
when
i
saw
her
last
i
could
not
speak
for
gazing
oh
lingering
bud
of
may
dear
as
when
first
i
met
her
worn
in
my
heart
always
margaretta
we
parted
near
the
stile
as
morn
was
faintly
breaking
for
many
a
weary
mile
oh
how
my
heart
was
aching
but
distance
time
and
change
have
lost
me
margaretta
and
yet
is
sadly
strange
that
i
can
not
forget
her
o
queen
of
rural
maids
my
magaretta
the
heart
the
mind
upbraids
that
struggles
to
forget
her
my
love
i
know
will
seem
a
wayward
boyish
folly
but
ah
it
was
a
dream
most
sweet
most
melancholy
were
mine
the
world
domain
to
me
fortune
better
to
be
a
boy
again
and
dream
of
margaretta
oh
memory
of
the
past
why
linger
to
regret
her
my
first
love
was
my
last
and
that
is
margaretta
the
colonel
the
colonel
such
a
creature
i
met
him
at
the
ball
so
fair
in
form
and
feature
and
so
divinely
tall
he
praised
my
dimpled
cheeks
and
curls
while
whirling
through
the
dance
and
matched
me
with
the
girls
of
italy
and
france
he
said
in
accents
thrilling
love
boundless
as
the
sea
and
i
dear
maid
am
willing
to
give
up
all
for
thee
i
heard
him
blushed
would
ask
mamma
and
then
my
eyes
grew
dim
he
looked
i
said
mamma
papa
i
give
up
all
for
him
my
governor
is
rich
and
old
this
well
the
colonel
knew
love
wings
he
said
when
fringed
with
gold
are
beautiful
to
view
i
thought
his
quite
the
ton
until
i
saw
him
stare
when
merely
told
that
brother
john
papa
would
make
his
heir
next
day
and
the
day
after
i
dressed
for
him
in
vain
was
moved
to
tears
and
laughter
he
never
came
again
but
i
have
heard
for
widow
dash
he
bought
the
bridal
ring
and
he
will
we
her
for
her
cash
the
ugly
hateful
thing
the
sweep
carol
see
notes
through
the
streets
of
new
york
city
blithely
every
morn
i
carolled
my
artless
ditty
cheerly
though
forlorn
before
the
rosy
light
my
lay
was
to
the
maids
begun
ere
winters
snows
had
passed
away
or
smiled
the
summer
sun
carol
o
a
y
e
o
in
summer
months
i
fondly
woo
those
merry
girls
with
faces
of
ebon
hue
and
teeth
like
eastern
pearls
one
vowed
my
love
she
would
repay
her
heart
my
song
had
won
when
winter
snows
had
passed
away
and
smiled
the
summer
sun
carol
o
a
y
e
o
a
year
alas
had
scarcely
flown
hope
beamed
but
to
deceive
ere
i
was
left
to
weep
alone
from
morn
till
dewy
eve
she
died
one
dreary
break
of
day
grief
weighs
my
heart
upon
in
vain
the
snows
may
pass
away
or
smile
the
summer
sun
carol
o
a
y
e
o
the
seasons
of
love
the
of
love
is
both
happy
and
gay
for
joy
sprinkles
blossoms
and
balm
in
our
way
the
sky
earth
and
ocean
in
beauty
repose
and
all
the
bright
future
is
coleur
de
rose
the
summer
of
love
is
the
bloom
of
the
heart
when
hill
grove
and
valley
their
music
impart
and
the
pure
glow
of
heaven
is
seen
in
fond
eyes
as
lakes
show
the
rainbow
that
hung
in
the
skies
the
autumn
of
love
is
the
season
of
cheer
life
mild
indian
summer
the
smile
of
the
year
which
comes
when
the
golden
ripe
harvest
is
stored
and
yields
its
own
blessings
repose
and
reward
the
winter
of
love
is
the
beam
that
we
win
while
the
storm
scowls
without
from
the
sunshine
within
love
reign
is
eternal
the
heart
is
his
throne
and
he
has
all
seasons
of
life
for
his
own
my
woodland
bride
here
upon
the
till
now
we
met
together
here
i
won
my
woodland
bride
in
flush
of
summer
weather
green
was
then
the
this
dear
retreat
that
shaded
autumn
winds
are
round
me
now
and
the
leaves
have
faded
she
whose
heart
was
all
my
own
in
this
with
all
pleasant
things
has
flown
sunbeam
bird
and
flower
but
her
memory
will
stay
with
me
though
we
parted
from
the
scene
i
turn
away
lone
and
oh
think
of
me
oh
think
of
me
my
own
beloved
whatever
cares
beset
thee
and
when
thou
hast
the
falsehood
proved
of
those
with
smiles
who
met
thee
while
the
sea
think
love
of
me
who
never
can
forget
thee
let
memory
trace
the
where
i
with
tears
regret
thee
bright
as
you
star
within
my
mind
a
hand
unseen
hath
set
thee
there
hath
thine
image
been
enshrined
since
first
dear
love
i
met
thee
so
in
thy
breast
i
fain
would
rest
if
haply
fate
would
let
me
and
live
or
die
so
thou
wert
nigh
to
love
or
to
regret
me
my
bark
is
out
upon
the
sea
my
bark
is
out
upon
the
sea
the
moon
above
her
light
a
presence
seems
to
me
like
woman
love
my
native
land
i
left
behind
afar
i
roam
in
other
climes
no
hearts
i
find
like
those
at
home
of
all
yon
sisterhood
of
stars
but
one
is
true
she
paves
my
path
with
silver
bars
and
beams
like
you
whose
purity
the
waves
recall
in
music
flow
as
round
my
bark
they
rise
and
fall
in
liquid
snow
the
breeze
now
swells
our
sails
a
storm
is
on
the
weary
moon
dim
lustre
fails
the
stars
are
gone
not
so
fades
love
eternal
light
when
weep
i
know
one
heart
with
me
upon
the
deep
will
nobody
marry
me
for
a
husband
there
danger
in
longer
delay
shall
i
never
again
have
a
beau
will
nobody
marry
me
pray
i
begin
to
feel
strange
i
declare
with
beauty
my
prospects
will
fade
i
give
myself
up
to
despair
if
i
thought
i
should
die
an
old
maid
i
once
cut
the
beaux
in
a
huff
i
thought
it
a
sin
and
a
shame
that
no
one
had
spirit
enough
to
ask
me
to
alter
my
name
so
i
turned
up
my
nose
at
the
short
and
cast
down
my
eyes
at
the
tall
but
then
i
just
did
it
in
sport
and
now
i
no
lover
at
all
these
men
are
the
plague
of
my
life
is
hard
from
so
many
to
choose
should
any
one
wish
for
a
wife
could
i
have
the
heart
to
refuse
i
do
know
for
none
have
proposed
oh
dear
me
i
frightened
i
vow
good
gracious
who
ever
supposed
that
i
should
be
single
till
now
the
star
of
love
the
star
of
love
now
shines
above
cool
zephyrs
crisp
the
sea
among
the
leaves
the
weaves
its
serenade
for
thee
the
star
the
breeze
the
wave
the
trees
their
minstrelsy
unite
but
all
are
drear
till
thou
appear
to
decorate
the
night
the
light
of
noon
streams
from
the
moon
though
with
a
milder
ray
hill
and
grove
like
woman
love
it
cheers
us
on
our
way
thus
all
that
bright
the
moon
the
night
the
heavens
the
earth
the
sea
exert
their
powers
to
bless
the
hours
we
dedicate
to
thee
love
comes
and
goes
like
a
spell
how
no
one
knows
nor
can
tell
now
here
now
there
then
away
none
dreameth
where
love
should
be
true
as
the
star
seen
in
the
blue
sky
afar
not
here
now
there
like
the
lay
of
lutes
in
th
air
should
love
depart
not
a
tie
binds
up
the
heart
till
we
die
now
here
now
there
sad
we
stray
life
is
all
care
not
married
yet
i
single
yet
i
single
yet
and
years
have
flown
since
i
came
out
in
vain
i
sigh
in
vain
i
fret
ye
gods
what
are
the
men
about
i
vow
i
twenty
o
ye
powers
a
spinster
lot
is
hard
to
bear
on
earth
alone
to
pass
her
hours
and
afterward
lead
apes
down
there
no
offer
yet
no
offer
yet
i
puzzled
quite
to
make
it
out
for
every
beau
my
cap
i
set
what
what
what
are
the
men
about
they
do
propose
they
wo
propose
for
fear
perhaps
i
not
say
yes
just
let
them
try
for
heaven

i
tired
of
not
married
yet
not
married
yet
the
deuce
is
in
the
men
i
fear
i
like
a
something
to
be
let
and
to
be
let
alone
that
clear
they
say
she
pretty
but
no
chink
and
love
without
it
runs
in
debt
it
agitates
my
nerves
to
think
that
i
have
had
no
offer
yet
lady
of
england
lady
of
england
the
seas
thy
name
was
borne
on
every
breeze
till
all
this
sunset
clime
became
familiar
with
victoria
name
though
seas
divide
us
many
miles
yet
for
the
queen
of
those
fair
isles
which
gave
our
fathers
birth
there
roves
a
blessing
from
this
land
of
groves
our
fatherland
fit
theme
for
song
when
thou
art
named
what
memories
throng
shall
england
cease
our
love
to
claim
not
while
our
language
is
the
same
scion
of
kings
so
live
and
reign
that
when
thy
nation
swelling
strain
is
breathed
amid
our
forests
green
we
too
may
sing
god
save
the
queen
oh
this
love
music
jess
macfarlane
oh
this
love
this
love
i
ainse
the
passion
slighted
but
hearts
that
truly
love
must
break
or
be
united
oh
this
love
when
first
he
cam
to
woo
i
little
cared
aboot
him
but
seene
i
felt
as
though
i
could
na
live
without
him
oh
this
love
he
brought
to
me
the
ring
my
hand
asked
o
my
mither
i
could
na
bear
the
thought
that
he
should
we
anither
oh
this
love
and
now
i
a
his

in
a
his
joys
i
mingle
nae
for
the
wealth
of
warlds
wad
i
again
be
single
oh
this
love
mary
one
balmy
summer
night
mary
just
as
the
risen
moon
had
thrown
aside
her
fleecy
veil
we
left
the
gay
saloon
and
in
a
green
sequestered
spot
beneath
a
drooping
tree
fond
words
were
breathed
by
you
forgot
that
still
are
dear
to
me
mary
that
still
are
dear
to
me
oh
we
were
happy
then
mary
time
lingered
on
his
way
to
crowd
a
lifetime
in
a
night
whole
ages
in
a
day
if
star
and
sun
would
set
and
rise
thus
in
our
after
years
the
world
would
be
a
paradise
and
not
a
vale
of
tears
mary
and
not
a
vale
of
tears
i
live
but
in
the
past
mary
the
glorious
day
of
old
when
love
was
hoarded
in
the
heart
as
misers
hoard
their
gold
and
often
like
a
bridal
train
to
music
soft
and
low
the
moments
cross
my
brain
in
all
their
summer
glow
mary
in
all
their
summer
glow
these
visions
form
and
fade
mary
as
age
comes
stealing
on
to
bring
the
light
and
leave
the
shade
of
days
for
ever
gone
the
poet
brow
may
wear
at
last
the
bays
that
round
it
fall
but
love
has
of
the
past
far
dearer
than
them
all
mary
far
dearer
than
them
all
the
beam
of
devotion
i
never
could
find
a
good
reason
why
sorrow
unbidden
should
stay
and
all
the
bright
joys
of
life
season
be
driven
unheeded
away
our
cares
would
wake
no
more
emotion
were
we
to
our
lot
but
resigned
than
pebbles
flung
into
the
ocean
that
leave
scarce
a
ripple
behind
the
world
has
a
spirit
of
beauty
which
looks
upon
all
for
the
best
and
while
it
discharges
its
duty
to
providence
leaves
all
the
rest
that
spirit
the
beam
of
devotion
which
lights
us
through
life
to
its
close
and
sets
like
the
sun
in
the
ocean
more
beautiful
far
than
it
rose
the
welcome
and
farewell
to
meet
and
part
as
we
have
met
and
parted
one
moment
cherished
and
the
next
forgot
to
wear
a
smile
when
almost
i
know
full
well
is
hapless
woman
lot
yet
let
me
to
thy
tenderness
appealing
avert
this
brief
but
melancholy
doom
content
that
close
beside
the
thorn
of
feeling
grows
memory
like
a
rose
in
guarded
bloom
love
history
dearest
is
a
sad
one
ever
yet
often
with
a
smile
i
heard
it
told
oh
there
are
records
of
the
heart
which
never
are
to
the
scrutinizing
gaze
unrolled
my
eyes
to
thine
may
scarce
again
aspire
still
in
thy
memory
dearest
let
me
dwell
and
hush
with
this
hope
the
magnetic
wire
wild
with
our
mingled
welcome
and
farewell
is
now
the
promised
hour
a
serenade
the
fountains
serenade
the
flowers
upon
their
silver
lute
and
nestled
in
their
leafy
bowers
the
are
mute
the
bright
and
glittering
hosts
above
unbar
their
golden
gates
while
nature
holds
her
court
of
love
and
for
her
client
waits
then
lady
wake
in
beauty
rise
is
now
the
promised
hour
when
torches
kindle
in
the
skies
to
light
thee
to
thy
bower
the
day
we
dedicate
to
care
to
love
the
witching
night
for
all
that
beautiful
and
fair
in
hours
like
these
unite
thus
the
sweets
to
flowerets
given
the
moonlight
on
the
tree
and
all
the
bliss
of
earth
and
heaven
are
mingled
love
in
thee
then
lady
wake
in
beauty
rise
is
now
the
promised
hour
when
torches
kindle
in
the
skies
to
light
thee
to
thy
bower
the
songs
of
home
oh
sing
once
more
those
dear
familiar
lays
whose
gliding
measure
every
bosom
thrills
and
takes
my
heart
back
to
the
happy
days
when
first
i
sang
them
on
my
native
hills
with
the
fresh
feelings
of
the
olden
times
i
hear
them
now
upon
a
foreign
shore
the
simple
music
and
the
artless
rhymes
oh
sing
those
dear
familiar
lays
once
more
those
cheerful
lays
of
other
days
oh
sing
those
cheerful
lays
once
more
oh
sing
once
more
those
strains
which
half
forgotten
in
my
memory
dwell
they
send
the
bounding
thro
my
veins
and
linger
round
me
like
a
fairy
spell
the
songs
of
home
are
to
the
human
heart
far
dearer
than
the
notes
that
pour
and
of
our
very
nature
form
a
part
then
sing
those
dear
familiar
lays
once
more
those
cheerful
lays
of
other
days
oh
sing
those
cheerful
lays
once
more
masonic
hymn
our
order
like
the
ark
of
yore
upon
the
raging
sea
was
tossed
secure
amid
the
billow
roar
it
moved
and
nothing
has
been
lost
when
elements
discordant
seek
to
wreck
what
god
in
mercy
saves
the
struggle
is
as
vain
and
weak
as
that
of
the
retiring
waves
the
power
who
bade
the
waters
cease
the
pilot
of
the
pilgrim
band
he
gave
the
gentle
dove
of
peace
the
branch
she
bore
them
from
the
land
in
him
alone
we
put
our
trust
with
heart
and
hand
and
one
accord
ascribing
with
the
true
and
just
all
holiness
unto
the
lord
the
dismissed
i
suppose
she
was
right
in
rejecting
my
suit
but
why
did
she
kick
me
down
stairs
halleck
discarded
the
wing
of
my
spirit
is
broken
my
of
hope
has
declined
for
a
month
not
a
word
have
i
spoken
that
either
polite
or
refined
my
mind
like
the
sky
in
bad
weather
when
around
us
are
curled
and
viewing
myself
altogether
i
the
veriest
wretch
in
the
world
i
wander
about
like
a
vagrant
i
spend
half
my
time
in
the
street
my
conduct
improper
and
flagrant
for
i
quarrel
with
all
that
i
meet
my
dress
too
is
wholly
neglected
my
hat
i
pull
over
my
brow
and
i
look
like
a
fellow
suspected
of
wishing
to
kick
up
a
row
in
vain
i
endeavored
to
borrow
from
friends
some
material
aid
for
my
landlady
views
me
with
sorrow
when
she
thinks
of
the
bill
that
unpaid
abroad
my
acquaintances
flout
me
the
ladies
cry
bless
us
look
there
and
the
little
boys
cluster
about
me
and
sensible
citizens
stare
one
says
he
a
victim
to
cupid
another
his
conduct
too
bad
a
third
he
is
awfully
stupid
a
fourth
he
is
perfectly
mad
and
then
i
am
watched
like
a
bandit
mankind
with
me
all
are
at
strife
by
heaven
no
longer
i
stand
it
but
quick
put
an
end
to
my
life
i
thought
of
the
means
yet
i
shudder
at
dagger
or
ratsbane
or
rope
at
drawing
with
lancet
my
blood
or
at
razor
without
any
soap
suppose
i
should
fall
in
a
duel
and
thus
leave
the
stage
with
eclat
but
to
die
with
a
bullet
is
cruel
besides
be
breaking
the
law
yet
one
way
remains
to
the
river
i
fly
from
the
goadings
of
care
but
drown
oh
the
thought
makes
me
shiver
a
terrible
death
i
declare
ah
no
i
once
more
see
my
kitty
and
parry
her
cruel
disdain
beseech
her
to
take
me
in
pity
and
never
dismiss
me
again

in

the

deck
the

brows
of
those
who
for
their

died
in
sorrow
that
the
sable
pall
enfolds
the
valiant
and
the

in
pride
that
those
who
nobly

win
garlands
that
adorn

imitation
of
the
lays
of
the
olden
time
come
list
to
the
lay
of
the
olden
time
a
troubadour
sang
on
a
moonlit
stream
the
scene
is
laid
in
a
foreign
clime
a
century
back
and
love
is
the
theme
love
was
the
theme
of
the
troubadour
rhyme
of
lady
and
lord
of
the
olden
time
at
an
turret
a
lady
fair
knelt
at
the
close
of
the
her
beads
she
numbered
in
silent
prayer
for
one
far
away
whom
to
love
was
her
crime
love
sang
the
troubadour
love
was
a
crime
when
fathers
were
stern
in
the
olden
time
the
warder
had
spurned
from
the
castle
gate
the
minstrel
who
wooed
her
in
flowing
rhyme
he
came
back
from
battle
in
regal
estate
the
bard
was
a
prince
of
the
olden
time
love
sand
the
troubadour
listened
to
rhyme
and
welcomed
the
bard
of
the
olden
time
the
prince
in
disguise
had
the
lady
sought
to
chapel
they
hied
in
their
rosy
prime
thus
worth
won
a
jewel
that
wealth
never
bought
a
fair
lady
heart
of
the
olden
time
the
moral
the
troubadour
sang
of
my
rhyme
was
well
understood
in
the
olden
time

to
the
nation
for
economy
and
worth
while
unpaid
the
female
labor
in
the
lone
where
the
smile
of
friend
or
neighbor
never
for
a
moment
shone
my
creation
is
a
blessing
to
the
indigent
secured
banishing
the
cares
distressing
which
so
many
have
endured
mine
are
sinews
superhuman
ribs
of
oak
and
nerves
of
steel
i
the
iron
born
to
toil
and
not
to
feel
my
lady
waits
for
me
suggested
by
a
popular
german
melody
my
lady
waits
is
now
the
hour
when
morn
unbars
her
gates
my
vessel
glides
beneath
the
tower
where
now
my
lady
waits
her
signal
flutters
from
the
wall
above
the
friendly
sea
i
life
but
to
obey
her
call
my
lady
waits
for
me
my
lady
waits
for
me
she
waits
while
morning
opes
her
golden
gates
my
lady
waits
no
fairer
flower
deck
the
floral
grove
than
she
the
pride
of
hall
and
bower
the
lady
of
my
love
the
eastern
hills
are
flecked
with
light
the
curls
the
sea
by
love
and
truth
sustained
for
flight
my
lady

my

music
the
has
music
it
moans
to
the
tree
and
so
has
the
shell
that
complains
to
the
sea
the
lark
that
sings
merrily
over
the
lea
the
reed
of
the
rude
shepherd
boy
we
revel
in
music
when
day
has
begun
when
gush
into
glee
as
they
run
and
stars
of
the
morn
sing
their
hymns
to
the
sun
who
brightens
the
with
joy
the
spirit
of
melody
floats
in
the
air
her
instruments
tuning
to
harmony
there
our
senses
beguiling
from
sorrow
and
care
in
blessings
sent
down
from
above
but
nature
has
music
far
more
to
my
choice
and
all
in
her
exquisite
changes
rejoice
no
tones
thrill
my
heart
like
the
dear
human
voice
when
breathed
by
the
being
i
love
the
millionaire
in
the
upper
circles
moves
a
famous
man
who
has
had
no
equal
since
the
world
began
he
was
once
a
broker
down
by
the
exchange
he
is
now
a
nabob
do
you
think
it
strange
in
his
low
back
office
near
the
bowling
green
with
his
brother
brokers
he
was
often
seen
shaving
and
discounting
dabbling
in
the
stocks
he
achieved
a
fortune
of
a
million
rocks
next
he
formed
a
marriage
with
a
lady
fair
and
his
splendid
carriage
bowled
about
the
square
where
his
spacious
mansion
like
a
palace
stood
envied
and
admired
by
the
multitude
then
he
took
the
tour
of
the
continent
bearer
of
dispatches
from
the
president
a
legation
button
by
permission
wore
and
became
that
worthy
an
official
bore
charmed
with
foreign
countries
lots
of
coin
to
spend
he
a
house
in
london
took
a
the
west
end
where
he
dwelt
a
season
and
in
grandeur
shone
but
to
all
the
beau
monde
utterly
unknown
england
then
was
foggy
and
society
too
aristocratic
for
his
pedigree
so
he
crossed
the
channel
to
escape
the
blues
and
became
the
idol
of
the
parvenues
dear
delightful
paris
he
would
often
say
every
earthly
pleasure
one
can
have
for
pay
wealth
gives
high
position
but
when
money
tight
man
is
at
a
discount
and
it
serves
him
right
after
years
of
study
how
to
cut
a
dash
he
came
home
embellished
with
a
huge
moustache
now
he
is
a
lion
all
the
rage
up
town
and
gives
gorgeous
parties
supervised
by
brown
the
almighty
dollar
is
no
doubt
divine
and
he
worships
daily
at
that
noble
shrine
fashion
is
his
idol
money
is
his
god
and
they
both
together
rule
him
like
a
rod
books
and
busts
and
pictures
are
with
him
a
card
while
abroad
he
bought
them
cheaply
by
the
yard
but
his
sumptuous
dinners
to
a
turn
quite
right
with
his
boon
companions
are
his
chief
delight
thee
his
wit
and
wassail
like
flow
in
his
newest
stories
published
long
ago
his
enchanted
hearers
giggle
till
they
weep
as
it
is
their
duty
till
they
fall
asleep
on
his
carriage
panel
is
a
blazoned
crest
with
a
latin
motto
given
him
in
jest
his
black
coach
and
footman
dressed
in
livery
every
day
at
many
crowd
to
see
well
in
let
him
rest
in
peace
and
may
his
investments
cent
per
cent
increase
though
on
earth
for
no
one
cares
the
millionaire
so
does
not
exactly
his
devoted
heir
there
a
useful
moral
woven
with
my
rhyme
which
may
be
considered
at
some
other
time
crockery
is
not
porcelain
it
is
merely
delf
and
the
kind
most
common
is
the
man
himself
in
memory
of
charles
sandford
he
died
as
he
had
lived
beloved
without
an
enemy
on
earth
in
word
and
deed
he
breathed
and
moved
the
soul
of
honor
and
of
worth
his
hand
was
open
as
the
day
his
bearing
high
his
nature
brave
and
when
from
life
he
passed
away
our
hearts
went
with
him
to
the
grave
what
desolation
filled
our
home
when
death
from
us
our
treasure
bore
oh
for
the
better
world
to
come
where
we
shall
meet
to
part
no
more
the
hope
of
that
sustains
us
now
in
that
we
trust
on
bended
knee
while
thus
around
his
faded
brow
we
twine
the
wreath
of
memory
before
the
battle
the
clarion
call
of
liberty
rings
on
the
startled
gales
the
rising
hills
reverberate
the
rising
of
the
vales
through
all
the
land
the
thrilling
shout
swift
as
an
arrow
goes
columbia
champions
arm
and
out
to
battle
with
her
foes
after
the
battle
the
of
victory
is
vocal
in
the
air
the
strains
by
breathed
are
echoed
by
the
fair
the
eagle
with
the
wreath
soars
proudly
to
the
sun
proclaiming
the
good
fight
is
fought
and
the
great
victory
won
a
parody
on
old
long
island
shore
we
caught
a
cod
the
other
day
he
never
had
been
there
before
and
wished
that
he
had
stayed
away
we
laid
him
on
the
beach
to
dry
then
served
him
frizzled
on
a
dish
a
warning
to
the
smaller
fry
as
well
as
all
the
larger
fish
o
o
o
o
o
on
old
long
island
shore
we
caught
a
cod
the
other
day

never

before
and
wished
that

oh
was
a
scaly
thing
to
haul
this
from
his
native
spray
and
thus
to
frighten
one
and
all
the
finny
tribe
from
rockaway
they
shun
the
fisher
hook
and
line
and
never
venture
near
his
net
so
when
at
rockaway
you
dine
now
not
a
thing
but
clams
you
get

should
critics
at
my
ballad
carp
to
them
this
simple
truth
i
say
the
grammar
quite
as
good
as
sharp
wrote
on
the
beach
of
rockaway

tune
the
same
that
russell
cribbed

so
when

still
cut

be
a

strange

in

my

hath
as
soft
a
hand
as
any
queen
in

in

tiny

as

and
as

no

so
fair
a

so
sweet
a

her

her
gentle
form
and

my
lady
hath
a
golden
heart
free
from
the
dross
of
worldly
art
which
in
the
sight
of
heaven
above
is
mine
with
all
its
hoarded
love
her
love
her
boundless
wealth
of
love
love
in
exile
adapted
to
a
hungarian
melody
my
heart
i
gave
you
with
my
hand
in
brighter
days
than
these
in
that
beyond
the
distant
seas
where
you
were
all
the
world
to
me
devoted
fond
and
true
and
i
in
our
prosperity
was
all
the
world
to
you
robbed
by
a
tyrant
iron
sway
we
banished
from
that
land
away
sad
wanderers
from
our
native
home
a
ruler
in
a
foe
an
exiled
caravan
we
roam
but
hand
in
hand
we
go
and
thus
whatever
fate
betide
we
bless
our
lot
in
life
since
no
misfortunes
may
divide
the
husband
and
the
wife
here
we
defy
the
tyrant
will
we
happy
in
each
other
still
to
the
evening
star
the
woods
waved
welcome
in
the
breeze
when
many
years
ago
lured
by
the
songs
of
birds
and
bees
i
sought
the
dell
below
and
there
in
that
secluded
spot
where
silver
streamlets
roved
twined
the
green
ivy
round
the
cot
of
her
i
fondly
loved
in
dreams
still
near
that
porch
i
stand
to
listen
to
her
vow
still
feel
the
pressure
of
her
hand
upon
my
burning
brow
and
here
as
in
the
days
gone
by
with
joy
i
meet
her
yet
and
mark
the
of
her
eyes
fringed
with
its
lash
of
jet
o
fleeting
vision
of
the
past
from
memory
glide
away
ye
were
too
beautiful
to
last
too
good
to
longer
stay
but
why
attesting
evening
star
this
sermon
sad
recall
than
love
and
lose
is
better
far
to
never
love
at
all
welcome
home
my
mary
voice
it
is
the
hour
she
promised
to
be
here
taught
by
love
mysterious
power
i
know
that
she
is
near
i
hear
the
melody
she
sings
beneath
our
happy
dome
and
now
the
woodland
cheerly
rings
with
mary
welcome
home
my
mary
voice
i
hear
it
thrill
in
rapture
on
the
gale
as
she
comes
gliding
down
the
hill
to
meet
me
in
the
vale
in
all
the

on

i
chance
to

so
sweet

i
knew
a
sweet
girl
with
a
bonny
blue
eye
who
was
born
in
the
shade
the
wild
sycamore
made
where
the
brook
sang
its
song
all
the

and
the
moments
went
merrily
by
like

the
moments
flew
by

knew
a

who
replied
to
my
vow

like
the
brook
to
the
sea

i
yearn

for
thee

a

who
is
ever
my

epigrams
on
reading
grim
attack
upon
clinton
is
the
opinion
of
the
town
that
grim
a
silly
elf
in
trying
to
write
clinton
down
he
went
right
down
himself
on
hearing
that
morse
did
not
invent
the
telegraph
first
they
said
it
would
not
do
but
when
he
got
through
it
then
they
vowed
they
always
knew
that
he
did
do
it
lies
are
rolling
stones
of
course
but
they
ca
adhere
to
morse
address
for
the
benefit
of
william
dunlap
spoken
by
sharpe
what
gay
assemblage
greets
my
wondering
sight
what
scene
of
splendor
conjured
here
what
voices
murmur
and
what
glances
gleam
sure
is
some
flattering
unsubstantial
dream
the
house
is
crowded
everybody
here
for
beauty
famous
or
to
science
dear
doctors
and
lawyers
judges
belles
and
beaux
poets
and
painters
and
heaven
only
knows
whom
else
beside
and
see
gay
ladies
sit
lighting
with
smiles
that
fearful
place
the
pit
a
fairy
change
ah
pray
continue
it
gray
heads
are
here
too
listening
to
my
rhymes
full
of
the
spirit
of
departed
times
grave
men
and
studious
strangers
to
my
sight
all
gather
round
me
on
this
brilliant
night
and
welcome
are
ye
all
not
now
ye
come
to
speak
some
trembling
poet
awful
doom
with
frowning
eyes
a
want
of
mind
to
trace
in
some
new
actor
inexperienced
face
or
us
old
ones
oh
for
shame
to
rate
with
study
good
in
time
but
never
great
not
like
you
travelled
native
just
to
say
folks
in
this
country
can
act
a
play
the
ca
honor
how
the
creature
starts
his
wit
and
whiskers
came
from
foreign
parts
nay
madam
spare
your
blushes
you
i
mean
there
close
beside
him
oh
you
full
nineteen
you
need
not
shake
your
flowing
locks
at
me
the
man
your
sweetheart
then
i
dumb
you
see
i
let
him
off
you
punish
him
in
time
or
i
no
skill
in
prophecy
or
rhyme
a
nobler
motive
fills
your
bosoms
now
to
wreathe
the
laurel
round
the
silvered
brow
of
one
who
merits
it
if
any
can
the
artist
author
and
the
honest
man
with
equal
charms
his
pen
and
pencil
drew
bright
scenes
to
nature
and
to
virtue
true
full
oft
upon
these
boards
hath
youth
appeared
and
oft
your
smiles
his
faltering
footsteps
cheered
but
not
alone
on
budding
genius
smile
leaving
the
ripened
sheaf
unowned
the
while
to
boyish
hope
not
every
bounty
give
and
only
youth
and
beauty
bid
to
live
will
you
forget
the
services
long
past
turn
the
old
out
to
die
at
last
when
his
proud
strength
and
noble
fleetness
his
faithful
bosom
dares
the
charge
no
more
ah
no
the
sun
that
loves
his
beams
to
shed
round
every
opening
floweret
tender
head
with
smiles
as
kind
his
genial
radiance
throws
to
cheer
the
sadness
of
the
fading
rose
thus
he
whose
merit
claims
this
dazzling
crowd
points
to
the
past
and
has
his
claims
allowed
looks
brightly
forth
his
faithful
journey
done
and
rests
in
triumph
like
the
setting
sun

for
the

grave
politicians
who
have
weighed

the
next

the

with

seated
like
true

down

all
wear
a
glow
of

in
their

might
well
become
apollo
and
the
graces
except
one
yonder
with
a
look
infernal
like
a
blurred
page
from
fanny
kemble
journal
but
to
my
task
the
muse
when
i
began
spoke
of
the
writer
welcome
ye
the
man
genius
at
best
acts
but
an
humble
part
unless
obedient
to
an
honest
heart
and
such
a
one
is
his
for
whom
these
walls
are
crowded
with
this
cheering
sight
ye
love
the
poet
oft
have
conned
him
knew
ye
the
man
ye
love
him
ten
times
more
ye
critics
spare
him
from
your
tongue
and
quill
ye
gods
applaud
him
and
ye
fops
be
still
address
for
the
benefit
of
henry
placide
spoken
by
mrs
hilson
the
music
done
be
quiet
durie
your
bell
and
whistle
put
me
in
a
fury
do
ring
up
yet
sir
i
a
word
to
say
before
the
curtain
rises
for
the
play
your
pardon
gentlefolks
nor
think
me
bold
because
i
thus
our
worthy
promoter
scold
all
feigned
anger
this
enlightened
age
requires
a
ruse
to
bring
one
on
the
stage
well
here
i
am
quite
dazzled
with
the
sight
presented
on
this
brilliant
festal
night
i
turn
whole
rows
of
patrons
sit
the
house
is
full
box
gallery
and
pit
who
says
the
public
are
unkind
i
know
them
well
and
plainly
speak
my
mind
it
is
our
right
the
ancient
poet
sung
he
knew
the
value
of
a
woman
tongue
with
this
i
will
defend
ye
and
rehearse
five
glorious
acts
of
yours
in
modern
verse
each
one
concluding
with
a
generous
deed
for
dunlap
cooper
woodworth
knowles
placide
was
nobly
done
ye
patriots
and
scholars
besides
they
netted
twenty
thousand
dollars
a
good
round
sum
in
these
degenerate
times
this
world
so
called
in
halleck
rhymes
and
proof
conclusive
you
will
frankly
own
in
liberal
actions
stands
alone
though
roams
he
oft
green
poetic
bowers
the
actor
path
is
seldom
strewn
with
flowers
his
is
a
silent
secret
patient
toil
while
others
sleep
he
burns
the
midnight
oil
pores
his
books
thence
inspiration
draws
and
waste
his
life
to
merit
your
applause
o
ye
who
come
the
laggard
hours
to
while
and
with
the
muse
to
smile
remember
this
the
mirth
that
cheers
you
so
shows
but
the
surface
not
the
depths
below
then
judge
not
lightly
of
the
actor
art
who
smiles
to
please
you
with
a
breaking
heart
neglect
him
not
in
his
course
nor
treat
him
with
less
kindness
than
your
horse
up
hill
indulge
him
down
the
steep
descent
spare
and
do
urge
him
when
his
strength
is
spent
impel
him
briskly
the
level
earth
but
in
the
stable
do
forget
his
worth
so
with
the
actor
while
you
work
him
hard
be
mindful
of
his
claims
to
your
regard
but
hold
methinks
some
carping
cynic
here
will
greet
my
homely
image
with
a
sneer
well
let
us
see
i
would
the
monster
view
man
with
umbrageous
whiskers
is
it
you
ah
no
i
was
mistaken
every
brow
beams
with
benevolence
and
kindness
now
beauty
and
fashion
all
the
circles
grace
and
scowling
envy
here
were
out
of
place
on
every
side
the
wise
and
good
appear
the
very
pillars
of
the
state
are
here
there
sit
the
doctors
of
the
legal
clan
there
all
the
city
rulers
to
a

critics
and
editors
and

buzzing

like
a
hive
of
bees
and
there
as
if
to
keep
us
all
in
order
our
worthy
friends
the
mayor
and
the
recorder
well
peace
be
with
you
friends
of
native
worth
yours
is
the
power
to
call
it
into
birth
yours
is
the
genial
influence
that
smiles
upon
the
budding
flowerets
opening
to

now

you
commenced
in

if
it
is
convenient
albert
right
willingly
frederick
after
his
conquest
of
saxony
transported
by
force
several
manufacturers
from
dresden
to
berlin
where
he
established
a
porcelain
factory
wedgewood
separated
from
their
friends
home
and
country
these
unfortunate
people
are
compelled
to
continue
their
labors
for
the
profit
and
glory
of
their
conqueror
i
know
it
go
on
albert
among
those
in
bondage
is
sophia
mansfield
wedgewood
i
have
heard
of
her
a
young
beautiful
and
girl
albert
several
pieces
of
her
design
and
modelling
were
shown
to
the
king
when
he
was
at
meissen
in
saxony
and
he
was
so
struck
with
their
beauty
that
he
determined
to
convey
the
artist
with
other
prisoners
to
his
capital
wedgewood
where
he
issued
his
royal
edict
compelling
the
girls
of
the
factory
to
marry
prussian
soldiers
unfeelingly
odd
albert
sophia
has
yet
escaped
this
tyranny
the
overseer
however
has
demanded
her
hand
but
i
shall
be
in
time
to
thwart
his
purposes
wedgewood
but
to
effect
that
you
must
also
thwart
the
purposes
of
frederick
himself
who
i
understand
is
as
stubborn
as
he
is
bold
albert
count
laniska
has
won
sophia
affections
and
love
is
a
power
that
can
not
be
controlled
wedgewood
veritably
odd
albert
you
are
on
your
way
to
the
factory
have
you
free
admission
for
yourself
and
friends
wedgewood
indubitably
albert

we
will
with

at

we
are

a
muster

corporal
yes
the
king
is
never
so
happy
as
when
he
has
all
his
children
as
he
calls
us
about
him
harold
and
plaguy
good
he
takes
of
his
children
he
looks
after
our
domestic
as
well
as
our
public
interests
it
was
a
strange
whim
in
old
fritz
to
offer
each
of
his
soldiers
one
of
the
factory
girls
for
a
wife
corporal
i
wonder
the
old
hero
does
not
marry
some
of
them
himself
harold
he
would
rather
look
after
his
soldiers
than
meddle
with
the
fancies
of
the
women
and
at
his
age
too
corporal
nonsense
the
king
is
a
boy
a
mere
boy
of
seventy
but
he
does
meddle
with
the
women
sometimes
harold
say
you
so
corporal
ay
and
old
ones
too
it
was
but
the
other
day
that
he
pensioned
a
poor
widow
whose
only
son
fell
in
a
skirmish
at
his
side
heaven
bless
his
old
cocked
hat
harold
yes
is
it
not
singular
that
one
so
mindful
of
the
rights
of
old
women
should
compel
the
young
ones
to
toil
as
they
do
in
the
factory
corporal
tush
tush
man
that
none
of
your
concern
nor
mine
what
have
we
to
do
with
state
affairs
harold
right
corporal
and
it
not
worth
while
for
us
to
trouble
our
heads
about
other
people
business
corporal
you
a
sensible
fellow
harold
right
again
and
i
would
return
the
compliment
if
you
did
not
wear
such
a
flashy
looks
at
it
corporal
that
personal
harold
i
mean
it
to
be
so
what
the
devil
do
you
wear
it
for
corporal
to
gratify
a
whim
i
like
this
riband
it
was
a
present
from
an
old
sweetheart
of
mine
look
what
a
jaunty
air
it
gives
one
and
where
the
harm
of
keeping
up
appearances
harold
what
silly
vanity
but
let
me
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
beware
of
the
scrutiny
of
the
king
he
has
an
eye
like
a
hawk
old
as
he
is
and
if
he
should
happen
to
spy
your
corporal
pooh
pooh
he
would
not
notice
such
a
but
who
comes
yonder
that
hungarian
karl
let
make

for
he
a

i
do
fancy
what
a
man
to
woo

win
sophia
mansfield
harold
he
never
win
her
woo
her
as
he
may
count
laniska

harold
corporal

karl
repair
to

sun
yourself
in

bright
eyes
of

mansfield
that
will
warm
you
especially
if

laniska
happens
to
be

to
stir
up

fire
of

eh
karl
you
have
a
sharp

i
lack

i
another

which
you
lack

my

karl
does
he
suspect
no

waking
i
have
concealed
this
his

damning
evidence
of
my
guilt
the
mark
of
cain
i
bear
about
me
is
known
to
none
and
the
secret
dies
with
for
that
young
pole
sophia
scorns
me
but
let
him
beware
my
revenge
though
slow
is
sure
karl
turns
to
go
but
perceiving
count
laniska
advancing
he
retires
to
a
tent
enter
laniska
who
notices
karl
in
the
distance
song
laniska
when
i
behold
that
lowering
brow
which
indicates
the
mind
within
i
marvel
much
that
woman
vow
a
man
like
that
could
ever
win
yet
it
is
said
in
rustic
bower
the
fable
i
have
often
heard
a
serpent
has
mysterious
power
to
captivate
a
timid
bird
this
precept
then
i
sadly
trace
that
love
a
fluttering
thing
of
air
and
yonder
lurks
the
viper
base
who
would
my
gentle
bird
ensnare
was
in
the
shades
of
eden
bower
this
fascination
had
its
birth
and
even
there
possessed
the
power
to
lure
the
paragon
of
earth
at
the
conclusion
of
the
song
karl
is
about
to
retire
laniska
addresses
him
count
come
hither
karl
karl
i
await
upon
your
leisure
count
count
i
would
have
some
words
with
you
karl
you
may
not
relish
the
frankness
of
my
manner
count
indeed
karl
look
you
count
laniska
i
am
a
plain
blunt
fellow
and
a
soldier
like
yourself
i
know
my
rights
and
knowing
will
maintain
them
it
was
by
the
king
permission
and
authority
that
i
chose
sophia
mansfield
for
my
bride
count
she
has
rejected
you
karl
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
matter
women
are
often
perverse
and
not
always
the
best
judges
of
their
own
welfare
and
you
know
she
must
be
mine
count
must
karl
yes
must
i
have
the
king
promise
and
frederick
was
never
known
to
break
his
word
count
you
surely
will
not
marry
her
against
her
will
karl
why
not
sophia
is
the
only
woman
i
ever
loved
and
now
that
i
have
her
sure
think
you
i
will
resign
her
count
and
think
you
the
king
will
force
an
angel
into
the
arms
of
a
monster
he
can
not
be
so
great
a
tyrant
karl
tyrant
count
yes
man
was
created
to
cherish
woman
not
to
oppress
her
and
he
is
the
worst
of
tyrants
who
would
injure
that
sex
whom
heave
ordains
it
his
duty
to
protect
karl
apply
you
this
to
the
king
count
to
the
king
or
to
any
he
in

who
would
use
his
power
to
oppress
the
unfortunate
but
come
sir
we
will
not
dispute
about
a
hasty
word
we
have
higher
duties
to
perform
karl
true
count
we
oppose
our
weapons
to
the
enemies
of

i
say
our
country
for
although
you
were
born
in

and
i
in
hungary
frederick
has
made
prussia
almost
as
dear
to
us
as
our
native
land
tyrant
though
he
may
but
we
will
not
quarrel
about

a
racing
pace

unmanageable
and
i
lost
my
presence
of
mind
i

a
gentleman
rushed
to
my
assistance
countess
who
was
he
frederica
i

an
elderly
person

seemed
to
be
a
foreigner
countess
but
he
was
young
of
course
frederica

handsome
as

adonis
countess

first
season

all
seasons
for
his

dear
mother

song
frederica
this
song
was
not
written
for
the
opera
but
was
introduced
by
the
composer
the
of
love
is
both
happy
and
gay
for
joy
sprinkles
blossoms
and
balm
in
our
way
the
sky
earth
and
ocean
in
beauty
repose
and
all
the
bright
future
is
couleur
de
rose
the
summer
of
love
is
the
bloom
of
the
heart
when
hill
grove
and
valley
their
music
impart
and
the
pure
glow
of
heaven
is
seen
in
fond
eyes
as
lakes
show
the
rainbow
that
hung
in
the
skies
the
autumn
of
love
is
the
season
of
cheer
life
mild
indian
summer
the
smile
of
the
year
which
comes
when
the
harvest
is
stored
and
yields
its
own
blessing
repose
and
reward
the
winter
of
love
is
the
beam
that
we
win
while
the
storm
howls
without
from
the
sunshine
within
love
reign
is
eternal
the
heart
is
his
throne
and
he
has
all
season
of
life
for
his
own
countess
silly
thoughtless
girl
what
strangers
are
these
coming
up
the
avenue
frederica
looking
out
as
i
live
the
elderly
person
i
told
you
of
and
the
young
gentleman
who
risked
his
life
to
save
mine
enter
wedgewood
and
albert
wedgewood
have
i
the
honor
of
addressing
the
countess
laniska
aside
flounces
frills
filagrees
and
furbelows
but
she
superlatively
odd
countess
i
am
the
countess
sir
wedgewood
presenting
letters
will
your
ladyship
be
pleased
to
receive
these
letters
of
introduction
if
quite
convenient
countess
receiving
letters
and
looking
at
them
wedgewood
from
esturia
and
london
and
wedgewood
introducing
albert
albert
worrendorf
countess
introducing
frederica
my
daughter
frederica
albert
aside
the
angel
we
met
by
accident
this
morning
wedgewood
aside
seraphically
odd
frederica
to
albert
we
have
seen
each
other
before
worrendorf
albert
to
my
great
happiness
madam
albert
and
frederica
converse
apart
countess
to
wedgewood
it
was
very
kind
in
my
correspondent
wedgewood
to
introduce
a
gentleman
of
your
celebrity
to
my
chateau
wedgewood
you
do
me
honor
madam
we
englishmen
are
people
we
are
not
unlike
our
earthenware
delf
and
common
clay
mixed
together
if
our
outsides
are
sometimes
rough
all
within
is
smooth
and
polished
as
the
best
of
work
it
is
the
purest
spirit
which
like
the
finest
china
lets
the
light
shine
through
it
aside
not
a
bad
compliment
to
myself
and
metaphorically
odd
countess
your
reply
reminds
me
of
the
object
of
your
visit
the
prussians
are
very
proud
of
the
manufactory
which
has
claimed
the
attention
of
the
king
wedgewood
oh
how
i
long
to
see
the
great
frederick
countess
you
will
like
him
i
am
confident
wedgewood
i
do
know
that
i
do
at
all
fancy
his
what
marry
a
parcel
of
handsome
innocent
industrious
girls
to
his
great
whiskered
whether
they
will
or
no
it
a
piece
of
moral
turpitude
an
insult
to
common
sense
and
infamously
odd
frederica
advancing
have
a
care
wedgewood
have
a
care
how
you
talk
about
the
king
he
possesses
a
sort
of
magical
ubiquity
and
is
here
there
and
every
where
at
the
same
moment
wedgewood
how
does
he
manage
that
frederica
he
wanders
about
in
secrecy
and
disguise
enters
all
kinds
of
mansions
and
often
conversations
that
were
never
intended
for
the
court
by
this
means
it
is
said
he
gathers
information
from
every
nook
and
corner
of
his
kingdom
wedgewood
strange
kind
of
work
for
a
monarch
peripatetically
odd
albert
i
have
been
told
that
he
knows
more
of
the
character
and
condition
of
his
subjects
and
soldiers
than
they
do
themselves
countess
and
he
never
knows
of
a
wrong
done
among
his
people
that
he
does
not
instantly
redress
though
it
often
puzzles
them
to
learn
how
he
arrives
at
his
knowledge
of
the
facts
many
think
him
a
wizard
wedgewood
and
not
without
reason
madam
never
before
have
i
heard
of
such
a
compound
of
sagacity
courage
and
eccentricity
oh
i
am
all
in
a
glow
to
see
and
converse
with
the
jolly
old
boy
enter
count
laniska
countess
introducing
him
my
son
the
count
laniska
will
present
you
to
his
majesty
wedgewood
bowing
to
count
if
it
is
convenient
aside
most
martially
and
uniformly
odd
to
laniska
but
first
i
should
like
to
have
a
glimpse
at
the
factory
count
i
shall
be
happy
to
show
it
to
you
there
is
one
extraordinary
subject
connected
with
it
that
will
surprise
you
both
a
young
girl
of
singular
talent
and
beauty
frederica
ah
brother
upon
your
favorite
theme
again
that
young
girl
occupies
more
of
your
thoughts
than
all
he
porcelain
in
these
dominions
albert
aside
poor
sophia
frederica
observing
the
count
looks
thoughtful
why
what
the
matter
with
you
brother
wedgewood
he
is
no
doubt
studying
the
mixture
of
different
kinds
of
clay
and
contriving
a
furnace
that
will
not
destroy
it
by
too
much
heat
ingeniously
odd
count
you
are
mistaken
sir
i
was
thinking
at
what
time
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
waiting
upon
you
wedgewood
i
will
be
at
your
service
as
soon
as
i
have
had
time
to
adjust
my
outward
and
refresh
my
inward
necessarily
odd
seeing
the
countess
about
to
retire
madam
allow
me
takes
her
hand
if
it
is
convenient
exit
wedgewood
and
countess
frederica
to
count
now
brother
that
the
countess
has
retired
pray
favor
us
with
your
confidence
you
need
not
mind
worrendorf
i
have
told
him
all
about
sophia
mansfield
i
love
that
poor
girl
myself
not
less
for
her
misfortunes
than
her
genius
albert
i
love
her
too
frederica
aside
oh
dear
what
the
matter
with
me
my
head
turns
round
i
am
ready
to
drop
count
with
emotion
you
love
her
wherefore
albert
she
is
my
countrywoman
and
for
that
i
love
her
frederica
recovering
well
gentlemen
i
must
say
this
is
very
gallant
of
you
both
to
be
praising
one
lady
so
highly
when
there
is
another
in
the
room
aside
oh
dear
me
how
near
i
came
to
betraying
myself
albert
your
pardon
my
dear
madam
when
i
look
at
you
i
almost
forget
there
is
another
woman
in
the
world
kisses
frederica
hand
who
turns
away
with
evident
confusion
but
for
the
present
i
must
leave
you
to
join
wedgewood
exit
count
noticing
them
aside
so
so
frederica
fairly
caught
i
perceive
to
frederica
ah
sister
sister
as
in
all
things
else
there
is
a
destiny
in
love
duet
lansika
and
frederica
from
my
fate
there
no
retreating
love
commands
and
i
obey
how
with
joy
my
heart
is
beating
at
the
fortunes
of
life
is
filled
with
strange
romances
love
is
blind
the
poets
say
when
he
comes
unsought
the
chance
is
of
his
own
accord
he
stay
love
can
be
forced
to
tarry
chain
him
he
the
bonds

not
matched
too
many

wed
alone
for
love
let
him
on

shall
fade

glory
in
which
we

time
i
require
of
you
that
you
look
upon
it
as
your
most
sacred
duty
to
show
kindness

to
all

melancholy
pointing

who
during

has
been
leaning
dejectedly
on
her
karl
standing
by
her
side
how
reluctantly
she
pursues
her
task
our
english
manufacturers
work
in
quite
another
manner
for
they
are
free
karl
and
are
free
men

free
women
never
indisposed
or
do
you
englishmen
blame
your
king
whenever
any
of
his
subjects
turn
pale
the
woman
at
whom
you
are
looking
is
evidently
wedgewodd
the
fie
upon
your
inhumanity
for
making
a
poor
sick
girl
work
when
she
seems
scarcely
able
to
hold
up
her
head
aside
i
do
half
like
that
fellow
villainously
odd
albert
to
sophia
my
poor
girl
what
is
the
matter
with
you
the
overseer
says
that
since
you
came
here
you
have
done
nothing
worthy
of
your
pencil
yet
this
charming
piece
pointing
to
an
ornament
on
her
painting
which
was
brought
from
saxony
is
of
your
design
is
it
not
sophia
yes
sir
it
was
my
misfortune
to
paint
it
if
the
king
had
never
seen
or
liked
it
i
should
now
be
albert
in
saxony
but
forget
that
country
and
you
may
be
happy
in
this
sophia
i
can
not
forget
it
i
can
not
forget
everybody
that
i
ever
loved
ask
not
a
saxon
woman
to
forget
her
country
albert
whom
do
you
love
in
saxony
now
sophia
whom
do
i
not
love
in

i
have
a

there
whom
i
have
not
seen
since
childhood
he
was
at
college
when
i
was
carried
off
from
the
cottage
in
which
we
both
were
born
he
is
ignorant
of
my
fate
she
regards
albert
with
great
attention
and
examines
his
features
minutely
albert
why
do
you
gaze
upon
me
so
intently
sophia
i
know
not
why
sir
but
you
seemed
even
now
a
dear
one
whom
i
have
wished
for
long
and
anxiously
albert
think
me
that
one
and
trust
me
sophia
i
will
for
there
a
cherub
nestling
in
my
heart
which
whispers
you
are
here
to
save
me
albert

that
poor
girl
often
thus
karl
she
sits
as
you
see
her
like
one
stupefied
half
the
day
wedgewood
the
cause
of
this
if
it
is
convenient
karl
she
has
fallen
to
the
lot
of
a
soldier
glancing
at
sophia
who
swears
if
she
delays
another
day
to
marry
him
that
he
will
complain
to
the
king
count
turning
furiously
upon
karl
wretch

cost
you

you
are
a
mere
instrument
in

are
a
powerful

this
detested
marriage

are
you
mad
count
raising
sophia
who
clings
to
him
and
shrinks
from
karl
i
will
do
so
or
perish
in
the
attempt

ah
say
you
so
then
the

shall
know
his
enemy

karl
following

those
who
have
the
command
of
motives

know
their
power
have
also
the
command
of
all
that
the
arts
or
what
is
called
a
genius
for
the
arts
can
produce
the
human
mind
and
human
ingenuity
are
much
the
same
in
italy
england
and
prussia
then
why
should
not
we
have
a
prussian
as
well
as
a
wedgewood

vase
we
shall

i

if
i

denounced
me
for
a

he
karl
karl
he
did
your
majesty
king
he
a
mere
stripling
and
i
permit
boys
and
fools
to
speak
of
me
as
they
list
but
i
am
no
tyrant
karl
he
might
have
spared
me
that
musingly
tyrant
karl
aside
it
rankles
deeply
king
recovering
from
his
meditation
youth
and
inexperience
to
say
nothing
of
love
pshaw
which
is
the
root
of
all
folly
shall
be
his
apology
this
time
but
let
him
beware
how
he
offends
again
karl
aside
it
moves
him
as
i
intended
king
no
i
am
no
tyrant
i
should
not
be
branded
with
such
a
title
karl
startled
branded
your

king
what
has
happened
karl
you
are
as
pale
as
ashes
what
mystery
is
here
i
am
to
be
trusted
karl
your
majesty
was
ever
kind
and
if
i
might
king
might
you
may
speak
freely
to
your
sovereign
your
friend
and
tell
me
what
it
is
that
weighs
upon
your
mind
song
karl
dared
these
lips
my
sad
story
impart
what
relief
it
would
give
to
my
heart
though
the
scenes
of
past
years
as
they
rise
bring
the
dews
of
remorse
to
my
eyes
yet
oh
hear
me
and
ever
conceal
what
in
agony
now
i
reveal
king
speak
freely
karl
karl
and
behold
while
i
throw
off
the
mask
ah
no
no
no
no
no
i
shrink
in
despair
from
the
task
in
the
page
of
my
life
there
appears
a
sad
passage
that
written
in
tears
could
but
that
be
erased
i
would
give
all
the
remnant
of
days
i
may
live
yet
the
cause
of
the
cloud
on
my
brow
i
have
never
disclosed
until
now
king
say
on
karl
karl
here
behold
it
is
branded
in
flame
ah
no
no
no
no
no
i
shrink
in
despair
from
my
shame
karl
rushes
out
king
there
a
mystery
about
that
fellow
that
i
can
not
whom
have
we
here
oh
the
english
traveller
who
is
in
such
a
good
humor
with
my
manufactory
and
who
has
such
strange
notions
respecting
me
good
good
draws
his
cloak
about
him
and
retires
enter
wedgewood
wedgewood
i
begin
to
perceive
that
i
shall
get
into
some
confounded
scrape
if
i
stay
here
much
longer
and
so
will
my
young
friend
worrendorf
who
has
made
me
his
confidant
but
mum
the
word
seeing
the
king
who
is
in
the
act
of
taking
snuff
ah
use
snuff
my
old
boy
odd
thank
you
for
a
pinch
takes
a
pinch
sans
ceremonie
and
without
the
king
consent
frederick
shuts
the
box
angrily
wedgewood
starts
back
in
aside
wonder
who
the
brown
jug
can
be
i
take
him
by
the
handle
and
pour
him
out
and
see
what
in
him
king
like
the
snuff
wedgewood
yes
snuffs
it
decent
blackguard
snuffs
quite
decent
king
taste
it
again
wedgewood
do
care
if
i
do
helps
himself
king
perhaps
you
will
also
do
me
the
favor
to
accept
the
box
wedgewood
taking
the
box
if
it
is
convenient
what
am
i
to
infer
from
this
king
that
you
and
i
can
not
take
snuff
out
of
the
same
box
my
box
is
not
large
enough
for
two
wedgewood
astonished
you
do
say
so
not
large
enough
for
two
looks
at
the
box
damn
me
if
i
do
think
it
large
enough
for
a
dozen
unless
they
took
snuff
with
a
shovel
aside
who
in
the
name
of
all
that
magnanimous
can
this
old
cockolorum
be
king
you
were
overheard
to
say
but
now
that
you
would
like
to
see
the
king
wedgewood
overheard
aside
ah
that
the
way
they
do
everything
here
a
man
ca
sneeze
without
some
one
of
the
four
winds
of
heaven
reporting
it
to
his
majesty
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
secret
in
the
whole
kingdom
how
do
the
women
get
along
i
wonder
to
frederick
like
to
see
the
king
certainly
i
should
king
that
box
will

odd
sort
of
character
from
habit
without
knowing
anything
more
about
it
than
the
man
in
the
moon
you
have
condemned
the
policy
of
the

this

the

should
dwell

dejected
bids
the
heart
farewell
count
what
sounds
are
these
no
human

is
some
gentle
spirit

the
midnight
bell
that
bids
a
sad
and
long
farewell
to
the
departed
hour
how
like
a
dirge
its
music
falls
within
these
cold
and
dreary
walls
where
stern
misfortunes
lower
ah
vainly
through
these
glide
the
pale
beams

riding
out

a
few
days
since
in
company
with
a
friend
who
was
once
the
expectant
heir
of
the
largest
estate
in
america
but
over
whose
worldly
prospects
a
blight
has
recently
come
he
invited
me
to
turn
down
a
little
romantic
woodland
pass
not
far
from
bloomingdale
your
object
inquired
i
merely
to
look
once
more
at
an
old
tree
planted
by
my
grandfather
near
a
cottage
that
was
once
my
father
the
place
is
yours
then
said
i
no
my
poor
mother
sold
it
and
i
observed
a
slight
quiver
of
the
lip
at
the
recollection
of
that
circumstance
dear
mother
resumed
my
companion
we
passed
many
happy
happy
days
in
that
old
cottage
but
it
is
nothing
to
me
now
father
mother
sisters
cottage
all
are
gone
and
a
paleness
his
fine
countenance
and
a
moisture
came
to
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
after
a
moment
pause
he
added
do
think
me
foolish
i
do
know
how
it
is
i
never
ride
out
but
i
turn
down
this
lane
to
look
at
that
old
tree
i
have
a
thousand
recollections
about
it
and
i
always
greet
it
as
a
familiar
and
friend
in
the
it
was
a
friend
indeed
under
its
branches
i
often
listened
to
the
good
counsel
of
my
parents
and
had
such
gambols
with
my
sisters
its
leaves
are
all
off
now
so
you
wo
see
it
to
advantage
for
it
is
a
glorious
old
fellow
in
summer
but
i
like
it
full
as
well
in
these
words
were
scarcely
uttered
when
my
companion
cried
out
there
it
is
near
the
tree
stood
an
old
man
with
his
coat
off
sharpening
an
ax
he
was
the
occupant
of
the
cottage
what
do
you
intend
doing
asked
my
friend
with
great
anxiety
what
is
that
to
you
was
the
blunt
reply
you
are
not
going
to
cut
that
tree
down
surely
yes
but
i
am
though
said
the
woodman
what
for
inquired
my
companion
almost
choked
with
emotion
what
for
why
because
i
think
proper
to
do
so
what
for
i
like
that
well
i
tell
you
what
for
this
tree
makes
my
dwelling
unhealthy
it
stands
too
near
the
house
prevents
the
moisture
from
exhaling
and
renders
us
liable
to
who
told
you
that
dr
s
have
you
any
other
reason
for
wishing
to
cut
it
down
yes
i
am
getting
old
the
woods
are
a
great
way
off
and
this
tree
is
of
some
value
to
me
to
burn
he
was
soon
convinced
however
that
the
story
about
the
was
a
mere
fiction
for
there
never
had
been
a
case
of
that
disease
in
the
neighborhood
and
then
was
asked
what
the
tree
was
worth
for
firewood
why
when
it
is
down
about
ten
dollars
suppose
i
make
you
a
present
of
that
amount
will
you
let
it
stand
yes
you
are
sure
of
that
positive
then
give
me
a
bond
to
that
effect
i
drew
it
up
it
was
witnessed
by
his
daughter
the
money
was
paid
and
we
left
the
place
with
an
assurance
from
the
young
girl
who
looked
as
smiling
and
beautiful
as
hebe
that
the
tree
should
stand
as
long
as
she
lived
we
returned
to
the
road
and
pursued
our
ride
these
circumstances
made
a
strong
impression
upon
my
mind
and
furnished
me
with
materials
for
the
song

herewith
send

a
letter

dated

february
the
chieftain
daughter
page
every
part
of
the
brief
but
glorious
life
of
pocahontas
is
calculated
to
produce
a
thrill
of
admiration
and
to
reflect
the
highest
honor
on
her
name
the
most
memorable
event
of
her
life
is
this
recorded
after
a
long
consultation
among
the
indians
the
fate
of
captain
smith
who
was
the
leader
of
the
first
colony
in
virginia
was
decided
the
conclave
resumed
their
silent
gravity
two
huge
stones
were
placed
near
the
water
edge
smith
was
lashed
to
them
and
his
head
was
laid
down
as
a
preparation
for
beating
out
his
brains
with
powhattan
raised
the
fatal
instrument
and
the
savage
multitude
with
their
weapons
stood
near
their
king
silently
waiting
the
prisoner
last
moment
but
smith
was
not
destined
to
thus
perish
pocahontas
the
beloved
daughter
of
the
king
rushed
forward
fell
upon
her
knees
and
with
tears
and
entreaties
prayed
that
the
victim
might
be
spared
the
royal
savage
rejected
her
suit
and
commanded
her
to
leave
smith
to
his
fate
grown
frantic
at
the
failure
of
her
supplications
pocahontas
threw
her
arms
about
smith
and
laid
her
head
on
his
her
raven
hair
falling
around
his
neck
and
shoulders
declaring
she
would
perish
with
or
save
him
the
indians
gasped
for
breath
fearing
that
powhatan
would
slay
his
child
for
taking
such
a
deep
interest
in
the
fate
of
one
he
considered
his
deadliest
foe
but
human
nature
is
the
same
everywhere
the
dropped
from
the
monarch
hand
his
brow
relaxed
his
heart
softened
and
as
he
raised
his
brave
daughter
to
his
bosom
and
kissed
her
forehead
he
reversed
his
decree
and
directed
smith
to
be
set
at
liberty
whether
the
regard
of
this
glorious
girl
for
smith
ever
reached
the
feeling
of
love
is
not
known
no
favor
was
ever
expected
in
return
ask
nothing
of
captain
smith
said
she
in
an
interview
she
afterward
had
with
him
in
england
recompense
for
what
i
have
done
but
the
boon
of
living
in
his
memory
john

wont
to
pride

on

occasion
had
the
good
fortune
to
save
her
life
the
prospect

their
separation
almost
maddened
her
to
sever
her
long
jetty
ringlets
from
her
exquisite
head

dress
in

attire
to
enroll
herself
in
the
corps
to
which
he
belonged
and
follow
his
fortunes
in
the
wars
unknown
to
him
was
a
resolution
no
sooner
conceived
than
taken
in
the
camp
she
attracted
no
particular
attention
except
on
the
night
before
battle
when
she
was
noticed
bending
over
his
couch
like
a
good
and
gentle
spirit
as
if
listening
to
his
dreams
the
camp
was
surprised
and
a
fierce
conflict
ensued
the
lovers
were
side
by
side
in
the
thickest
of
the
fight
but
endeavoring
to
turn
away
a
lance
aimed
at
the
heart
of
jasper
the
poor
girl
received
it
in
her
own
and
fell
bleeding
at
his
feet
after
the
victory
her
name
and
sex
were
discovered
and
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in

laid
in

we
seated
ourselves
in
the
shade
of
a
large
and
drank
of
a
spring
that
gurgled
beneath
it
the
indians
gave
a
groan
and
turned
their
faces
from
the
water
they
would
not
drink
of
the
spring
nor
eat
in
the
shade
of
the
tree
but
retired
to
a
ledge
of
rocks
at
no
great
distance
i
ventured
to
approach
them
and
inquire
the
cause
of
their
strange
conduct
one
of
the
indians
said
in
a
deep
and
solemn
tone
place
is
bad
for
the
the
blood
of
an
innocent
woman
not
of
our
enemies
rests
upon
that
spot
she
was
there
murdered
the
word
had
been
pledged
for
her
safety
but
the
evil
spirit
made
him
forget
it
she
lies
buried
there
no
one
avenged
her
murder
and
the
great
spirit
was
angry
that
water
will
make
us
more
thirsty
and
that
shade
will
scorch
us
the
stain
of
blood
is
on
our
hands

we
know
not
how
to
wipe
it
out
it
still
rests
upon
us
do
what
we
will

could

no
more
from
them
they
were
silent
even
for
indians
it
was
the
death
of
miss
mcrea
they
alluded
to
she
was
betrothed
to
a
young
american
by
the
name
of
jones
who
had
taken
sides
with
the
british
and
become
a
captain
of
their
service
the
lovers
however
had
managed
to
keep
up
a
correspondence
and
he
was
informed
after
a
battle
in
which
he
distinguished
himself
for
his
bravery
that
his
inamorata
was
concealed
in
a
house
a
few
miles
from
as
it
was
dangerous
for
him
to
take
his
horse
to
her
residence
and
bring
her
to
his
tent
in
safety
he
urged
her
in
his
letter
not
to
hesitate
a
moment
in
putting
herself
under
their
protection
and
the
voice
of
a
lover
is
law
to
a
confiding
woman
they
proceeded
on
their
journey
and
stopped
to
rest
under
a
large
near
a
spring
the
one
at
which
we
drank
here
they
were
met
by
another
party
of
indians
also
sent
by
the
impatient
lover
when
a
quarrel
arouse
about
her
which
terminated
in
her
assassination
one
of
the
indians
pulled
the
poor
girl
from
her
horse
and
another
struck
his
tomahawk
in
her
forehead
tore
off
her
scalp
and
gashed
her
breast
they
then
covered
her
body
with
leaves
and
left
her
under
the
huge
one
of
the
indians
made
her
lover
acquainted
with
the
facts
and
another
brought
him
her
scalp
he
knew
the
long
brown
tresses
of
miss
mcrea
and
in
defiance
of
all
danger
flew
to
the
spot
to
realize
the
horrid
scene
he
tore
away
the
leaves
clasped
the
body
in
his
arms
and
wrapping
it
in
his
cloak
was
about
bearing
it
away
when
he
was
prevented
by
his
superior
officers
who
ordered
the
poor
girl
to
be
buried
on
the
spot
where
she
had
been
immolated
after
this
event
a
curse
seemed
to
rest
upon
the
in
every
battle
their
forces
were
sadly
cut
up
the
americans
attacking
them
most
furiously
whenever
they
could
get
an
opportunity
the
prophets
of
the
indians
had
strange
auguries
they
saw
constantly
in
the
clouds
the
form
of
the
murdered
white
woman
invoking
the
blasts
to
overwhelm
them
and
direction
all
the
power
and
fury
of
the
americans
to
exterminate
every
of
the
forest
who
had
committed
the
hateful
deed
of
breaking
his
faith
and
staining
the
tomahawk
with
the
blood
of
a
woman
whose
spirit
still
called
for
revenge
it
was
agreed
among
the
indians
in
a
body
to
move
silently
away
and
by
morning
light
not
a
was
to
be
found
near
the
british
troops
captain
jones
too
was
no
more
in
the
battle
he
led
on
his
men
with
that
fearlessness
and
fury
that
distressed
minds
often
do
but
his
men
grew
tired
of
following
him
in
such
perilous
attacks
and
began
to
fly
as
he
returned
to
rally
them
he
received
a
ball
in
the
back
burning
with
shame
love
and
frenzy
he
tuned
and
threw
himself
on
the
bayonets
of
the
enemy
and
at
once
closed
his
agonies
and
expiated
his
political
offence
he
was
laid
by
the
side
of
her

so
ardently
loved
