when
the
evening
came
my
love
said
to
me
let
us
go
into
the
garden
now
that
the
sky
is
cool
the
garden
of
black
hellebore
and
rosemary
where
wild
woodruff
spills
in
a
milky
pool
low
we
passed
in
the
twilight
for
the
wavering
heat
of
day
had
waned
and
round
that
shaded
plot
of
secret
beauty
the
thickets
clustered
sweet
here
is
heaven
our
hearts
whispered
but
our
lips
spake
not
between
that
old
garden
and
seas
of
lazy
foam
gloomy
and
beautiful
alleys
of
trees
arise
with
spire
of
cypress
and
dreamy
beechen
dome
so
dark
that
our
enchanted
sight
knew
nothing
but
the
skies
veiled
with
soft
air
in
the
musk
or
the
dusky
dark
breath
of
clove
no
stars
burned
in
their
deeps
but
through
the
dusk
i
saw
my
eyes
and
they
were
brimmed
with
love
no
star
their
secret
ravished
no
wasting
moon
mocked
the
sad
transience
of
those
eternal
hours
only
the
soft
unseeing
heaven
of
june
the
ghosts
of
great
trees
and
the
sleeping
flowers
for
doves
that
crooned
in
the
leafy
noonday
now
were
silent
the
sought
his
secret
covers
nor
even
a
mild
moved
a
creaking
bough
was
ever
a
silence
deeper
made
for
lovers
was
ever
a
moment
meeter
made
for
love
beautiful
are
your
closed
lips
beneath
my
kiss
and
all
your
yielding
sweetness
beautiful
oh
never
in
all
the
world
was
such
a
night
as
this
testament
if
i
had
died
and
never
seen
the
dawn
for
which
i
hardly
hoped
lighting
this
lawn
of
silvery
grasses
if
there
had
been
no
light
and
last
night
merged
into
perpetual
night
i
doubt
if
i
should
ever
have
been
content
to
have
closed
my
eyes
without
some
testament
to
the
great
benefits
that
marked
my
faring
through
the
sweet
world
for
all
my
joy
was
sharing
and
lonely
pleasures
were
few
unto
which
end
three
legacies
send
three
legacies
already
half
one
to
a
friend
of
all
good
friends
the
best
better
than
which
is
nothing
yet
another
unto
thy
twin
dissimilar
spirit
brother
the
third
to
you
most
beautiful
most
true
most
perfect
one
to
whom
they
all
are
due
quick
quick
while
there
is
time
o
best
of
friends
i
leave
you
one
sublime
summer
one
fadeless
summer
begun
ere
cotswold
hawthorn
tarnished
in
the
sun
when
hedges
were
fledged
with
green
and
early
swallows
on
curved
wings
pillaged
the
fallows
when
all
our
vale
was
dappled
blossom
and
light
and
oh
the
scent
of
beanfields
in
the
night
you
shall
remember
that
rich
dust
at
even
which
made
old
evesham
like
a
street
in
heaven
and
washed
within
a
wave
of
golden
air
all
her
dreamy
towers
and
gables
olden
you
shall
remember
how
arms
hot
palms
with
rowing
clove
the
cool
water
of
avon
sweetly
flowing
and
how
our
bodies
beautifully
white
to
a
long
stroke
lengthened
in
green
light
and
we
emerging
laughed
in
childish
wise
and
pressed
the
kissing
water
from
our
eyes
ah
was
our
laughter
childish
or
were
we
wise
and
then
crown
of
the
day
a
tired
returning
with
happy
sunsets
over
bredon
burning
with
music
and
with
moonlight
and
good
ale
and
no
thought
for
the
morrow
heavy
phlox
our
garden
pathways
bordered
and
evening
stocks
those
humble
weeds
in
sunlight
withered
and
pale
with
a
night
scent
to
match
the
nightingale
gladdened
with
spicèd
sweetness
sweet
shadows
meeting
the
breath
of
hay
from
mowing
meadows
as
humble
was
our
joy
and
as
intense
our
rapture
so
before
i
hurry
hence
yours
be
the
memory
one
night
again
when
we
were
men
and
had
striven
and
known
pain
by
a
dark
canal
debating
unresigned
on
the
blind
fate
that
shadows
humankind
on
the
blind
sword
that
severs
human
love
then
did
the
hidden
belfry
from
above
on
troubled
minds
in
benediction
shed
the
patience
of
the
great
anonymous
dead
who
reared
those
towers
those
high
cathedrals
builded
in
solemn
stone
and
with
clear
fancy
gilded
a
beauty
beyond
ours
trusting
in
god
then
dared
we
follow
the
dark
way
they
trod
and
bowing
to
the
universal
plan
trust
in
the
true
and
fiery
spirit
of
man
and
you
my
brother
you
know
as
knows
one
other
how
my
spirit
revisiteth
a
room
in
a
high
wing
beneath
where
gloom
dwelleth
dispelled
by
resinous
wood
embers
where
in
how
the
heart
remembers
we
talked
of
beauty
and
those
fiery
things
to
which
the
divine
desirous
spirit
clings
in
a
rapture
to
that
heaven
flinging
where
beauty
is
an
easy
thing
and
singing
the
natural
speech
of
man
like
kissing
swords
our
wits
clashed
there
the
brittle
beauty
of
words
breaking
seemed
to
discover
its
secret
heart
and
all
the
rapt
elusiveness
of
art
now
i
have
known
sorrow
and
now
i
sing
that
a
lovely
word
is
not
an
idle
thing
for
as
with
stars
the
cloth
of
night
is
spangled
with
words
most
lovelily
entangled
the
woof
of
sombre
thought
is
deckt
ah
bright
and
cold
they
glitter
in
the
night
but
neither
distant
nor
dispassionate
for
beauty
is
an
armour
against
fate
i
tell
you
who
have
stood
in
the
dark
alone
seeing
the
face
that
turneth
all
to
stone
medusa
blind
with
hate
while
i
was
dying
beauty
sate
with
me
nor
tortured
any
longer
gracious
was
she
to
her
soft
words
i
listened
and
was
content
to
die
nor
sorry
that
my
light
was
spent
so
brother
if
i
come
not
home
go
to
that
little
room
that
my
spirit
revisiteth
and
there
somewhere
in
the
blue
air
you
shall
discover
if
that
you
be
a
lover
nor
haughtily
minded
all
that
once
then
fled
us
and
escaped
all
that
i
found
that
day
far
so
far
away
and
you
my
lovely
one
what
can
i
leave
to
you
who
you
having
left
am
utterly
bereft
what
in
my
store
of
visionary
dowers
is
not
already
yours
what
silences
what
hours
of
peace
passing
all
understanding
days
made
lyric
by
your
beauty
and
its
praise
years
neither
time
can
tarnish
nor
death
mar
wherein
you
shined
as
steadfast
as
a
star
in
my
bleak
night
heedless
of
the
scudding
in
torn
fleeces
black
of
my
dark
moods
as
those
who
rule
the
far
pleasaunces
of
heaven
are
so
think
but
lightly
of
that
afternoon
with
white
clouds
climbing
a
blue
sky
in
june
when
a
boy
worshipped
under
dreaming
trees
who
touched
your
hand
and
sought
your
eyes
ah
cease
not
these
not
these
nor
yet
those
nights
when
icy
brathay
thundered
under
his
bridges
and
ghostly
mountains
wondered
at
the
white
blossoming
of
a
christmas
rose
more
stainless
than
their
snows
nor
even
of
those
placid
days
together
mellow
as
early
amber
weather
when
beech
is
ankleted
with
fire
and
old
elms
wear
their
livery
of
yellow
gold
when
orchards
all
are
laden
with
increase
and
the
quiet
earth
hath
fruited
and
knows
peace
oh
think
not
overmuch
on
those
sweet
years
lest
their
last
fruit
be
tears
your
tears
beloved
that
were
my
utmost
pain
but
rather
dream
again
how
that
a
lover
half
poet
and
half
child
an
eager
spirit
of
fragile
fancies
wild
compact
adored
the
beauty
and
truth
in
you
to
your
own
truth
be
true
and
when
not
mournfully
you
turn
this
page
consider
still
your
starry
heritage
continue
in
your
loveliness
a
star
to
gladden
me
from
afar
even
where
there
is
no
light
in
my
last
night
lochanilaun
this
is
the
image
of
my
last
content
my
soul
shall
be
a
little
lonely
lake
so
hidden
that
no
shadow
of
man
may
break
the
folding
of
its
mountain
battlement
only
the
beautiful
and
innocent
whiteness
of
cloud
drooping
to
shake
cool
rain
upon
the
or
the
wake
of
cloud
in
a
howling
descent
for
there
shall
be
no
terror
in
the
night
when
stars
that
i
have
loved
are
born
in
me
and
cloudy
darkness
i
will
hold
most
fair
but
this
shall
be
the
end
of
my
delight
that
you
my
lovely
one
may
stoop
and
see
your
image
in
the
mirrored
beauty
there
lettermore
these
winter
days
on
lettermore
the
brown
west
wind
it
sweeps
the
bay
and
icy
rain
beats
on
the
bare
unhomely
fields
that
perish
there
the
stony
fields
of
lettermore
that
drink
the
white
atlantic
spray
and
men
who
starve
on
lettermore
cursing
the
haggard
hungry
surf
will
souse
the
bruisèd
grains
to
light
dark
fires
within
their
brains
and
fight
with
stones
on
lettermore
or
sprawl
beside
the
smoky
turf
when
spring
blows
over
lettermore
to
bloom
the
ragged
furze
with
gold
the
lovely
south
living
breath
is
laden
with
the
smell
of
death
for
fever
breeds
on
lettermore
to
waste
the
eyes
of
young
and
old
a
black
van
comes
to
lettermore
the
horses
stumble
on
the
stones
the
drivers
curse
for
it
is
hard
to
cross
the
hills
from
oughterard
and
cart
the
sick
from
lettermore
a
stinking
load
of
rags
and
bones
but
you
will
go
to
lettermore
when
white
are
on
the
run
when
purple
glows
between
the
rocks
about
lord
adown
the
road
to
lettermore
and
wide
seas
tarnish
in
the
sun
and
so
think
of
lettermore
as
a
lost
island
of
the
blest
with
peasant
lovers
in
a
blue
dim
dusk
with
heather
in
dew
and
the
sweet
peace
of
lettermore
remote
and
dreaming
in
the
west
lament
once
i
think
a
finer
fire
touched
my
lips
and
then
i
sang
half
the
songs
of
my
desire
with
their
splendour
the
world
rang
and
their
sweetness
made
me
free
of
those
starry
ways
whereby
planets
make
their
minstrelsy
in
echoing
unending
sky
so
before
that
spell
was
broken
song
of
the
wind
surge
of
the
sea
beautiful
passionate
things
unspoken
rose
like
a
breaking
wave
in
me
rose
like
a
wave
with
curled
crest
that
green
sunlight
splinters
through
but
the
wave
broke
within
my
breast
and
now
i
am
a
man
like
you
the
last
night
last
night
a
vision
of
you
sweetly
troubled
my
waking
dream
beneath
the
clear
algerian
blue
you
stood
with
lifted
eyes
the
beam
of
a
winter
sun
beat
on
the
crown
of
a
whose
delicate
fruit
like
pale
lamps
hung
airily
down
and
in
your
gazing
eyes
a
mute
and
lovely
wonder
have
i
sung
of
slender
things
and
naught
beside
you
were
so
beautifully
young
i
must
have
kissed
you
or
have
died
phthonos
if
in
high
jealousy
god
made
me
blind
and
laughed
to
see
me
stumble
in
the
night
driving
his
arrows
of
light
into
that
lost
dominion
of
my
mind
then
knowing
me
still
unvext
and
unresigned
stole
from
my
ears
all
homely
sounds
that
might
temper
the
darkness
saying
in
despite
i
had
not
wholly
left
the
world
behind
so
sunless
soundless
if
to
make
an
end
he
smote
the
nerves
that
move
the
nerves
that
feel
even
then
o
jealous
one
i
would
not
complain
if
i
were
spared
the
wealth
i
can
not
spend
if
i
were
left
the
treasure
none
can
steal
the
lovely
words
that
wander
through
my
brain
easter
adown
our
lane
at
eastertide
hosts
of
dancing
bluebells
lay
in
pools
of
light
and
you
cried
look
at
them
i
think
that
they
are
bluer
than
the
laughing
sea
and
you
cried
piece
of
the
sky
has
fallen
down
for
you
and
me
to
gaze
upon
and
and
i
seeing
in
your
eyes
the
dancing
blue
and
in
your
heart
the
innocent
birth
of
a
pure
delight
i
knew
i
knew
that
heaven
had
fallen
upon
earth
the
leaning
elm
before
my
window
in
days
of
winter
hoar
huddled
a
mournful
wood
smooth
pillars
of
beech
domed
chestnut
sycamore
in
stony
sleep
they
stood
but
you
unhappy
elm
the
angry
west
had
chosen
from
the
rest
flung
broken
on
your
branches
bare
and
left
you
leaning
there
so
dead
that
when
the
breath
of
winter
cast
wild
snow
upon
the
blast
the
other
living
branches
downward
bowed
shook
free
their
crystal
shroud
and
shed
upon
your
blackened
trunk
beneath
their
livery
of
death
on
windless
nights
between
the
beechen
bars
i
watched
cold
stars
throb
whitely
in
the
sky
and
dreamily
wondered
if
any
life
lay
locked
in
thee
if
still
the
hidden
sap
secretly
moved
as
water
in
the
icy
winterbourne
floweth
unheard
and
half
i
pitied
you
your
trance
forlorn
you
could
not
hear
i
thought
the
voice
of
any
bird
the
shadowy
cries
of
bats
in
dim
twilight
or
cool
voices
of
owls
crying
by
night
hunting
by
night
under
the
hornèd
moon
yet
half
i
envied
you
your
wintry
swoon
till
on
this
morning
mild
the
sun
steals
from
his
misty
prison
the
frozen
fallows
glow
the
black
trees
shaken
in
a
clear
flood
of
sunlight
vibrating
awaken
and
lo
your
ravaged
bole
beyond
belief
slenderly
fledged
anew
with
tender
leaf
as
pale
as
those
twin
vanes
that
break
at
last
in
a
tiny
fan
above
the
black
where
no
blade
springeth
green
but
pallid
bells
of
the
shy
helleborine
what
is
this
ecstasy
that
overwhelms
the
dreaming
earth
see
the
embrownèd
elms
crowding
purple
distances
warm
the
depths
of
the
wood
a
wind
tosses
their
tassels
brown
his
white
clouds
dapple
the
down
into
a
green
flame
bursting
the
hedgerows
stand
soon
with
banners
flying
spring
will
walk
the
land
there
is
no
day
for
thee
my
soul
like
this
no
spring
of
lovely
words
nay
even
the
kiss
of
mortal
love
that
maketh
man
divine
this
light
can
not
outshine
nay
even
poets
they
whose
frail
hands
catch
the
shadow
of
vanishing
beauty
may
not
match
this
leafy
ecstasy
sweet
words
may
cull
such
magical
beauty
as
time
may
not
destroy
but
we
alas
are
not
more
beautiful
we
can
not
flower
in
beauty
as
in
joy
we
sing
our
musèd
words
are
sped
and
then
poets
are
only
men
who
age
and
toil
and
sicken
this
tree
may
stand
in
leaf
when
i
have
ceased
to
be
the
joyous
lover
o
now
that
i
am
free
as
the
air
and
fleet
as
clouds
above
i
will
wander
everywhere
over
the
ways
i
love
lightly
lightly
will
i
pass
nor
scatter
as
i
go
a
shadow
on
the
blowing
grass
or
a
footprint
in
the
snow
all
the
wild
things
of
the
wood
that
once
were
timid
and
shy
they
shall
not
flee
their
solitude
for
fear
when
i
pass
by
and
beauty
beauty
the
wide
world
over
shall
blush
when
i
draw
near
she
knows
her
lover
the
joyous
lover
and
greets
him
without
fear
but
if
i
come
to
the
dark
room
from
which
our
love
hath
fled
and
bend
above
you
in
the
gloom
or
kneel
beside
your
bed
smile
soft
in
your
sleep
my
beautiful
one
for
if
you
should
say
to
the
dream
which
visiteth
you
alone
my
joy
would
wither
away
dead
poets
ode
written
at
wilton
house
last
night
amazed
i
trod
on
holy
ground
breathing
an
air
that
ancient
poets
knew
where
in
a
valley
compassed
with
sweet
sound
beneath
a
shades
of
yew
with
eager
feet
passèd
that
singer
sweet
who
stella
loved
whom
bloody
zutphen
slew
in
the
starred
zenith
of
his
knightly
fame
there
too
a
figure
i
did
meet
herbert
whose
faith
burned
true
and
steadfast
as
the
altar
flame
under
the
wilton
cedars
pondering
upon
the
pains
of
beauty
and
the
wrong
that
sealeth
lovely
lips
fated
to
sing
before
they
reach
the
cadence
of
their
song
i
mused
upon
dead
poets
mighty
ones
who
sang
and
suffered
briefly
heard
were
they
as
libyan
nightingales
weary
of
wing
fleeing
the
temper
of
saharan
suns
to
gladden
our
may
and
with
the
broken
blossom
vanishing
so
to
my
eyes
a
sorrowful
vision
came
of
one
whose
name
was
writ
in
water
bright
his
cheeks
and
eyes
burned
with
a
hectic
flame
and
one
alas
i
saw
whose
passionate
might
was
spent
upon
a
fevered
fen
in
greece
one
shade
there
was
who
starving
choked
with
bread
one
a
corpse
through
stormy
water
slips
one
in
the
numbing
found
peace
and
one
a
youth
lay
dead
with
powdered
arsenic
upon
his
lips
o
bitter
were
the
sorrow
that
could
dull
the
sombre
music
of
slow
evening
here
where
the
old
world
is
so
beautiful
that
even
lesser
lips
are
moved
to
sing
how
the
wide
heron
sails
into
the
light
black
as
the
cedarn
shadows
on
the
lawns
or
stricken
woodlands
patient
in
decay
and
river
water
murmurs
through
the
night
until
autumnal
dawns
burn
in
the
glass
of
watery
way
nay
these
were
they
by
whom
the
world
was
lost
to
whom
the
world
most
richly
gave
forlorn
beauty
they
counting
not
the
cost
if
of
their
torment
beauty
might
be
born
and
life
the
splendid
flower
of
their
delight
loving
too
eagerly
they
broke
and
the
perfume
that
the
folded
petals
close
before
its
prime
yet
their
frail
fingers
white
from
that
bruised
bloom
uttermost
attar
of
the
living
rose
wherefore
o
shining
ones
i
will
not
mourn
you
who
have
secret
ways
beneath
impotent
shadow
suffering
scorn
hatred
and
desolation
in
her
praise
thus
as
i
spoke
their
phantom
faces
smiled
as
brooding
night
with
heavy
downward
wing
fell
upon
elegiac
stone
on
the
dark
woodlands
and
the
waters
wild
and
every
living
thing
leaving
me
there
amazèd
and
alone
porton
water
through
porton
village
under
the
bridge
a
clear
bourne
floweth
with
grasses
trailing
wherein
are
shadows
of
white
clouds
sailing
and
elms
that
shelter
under
the
ridge
through
porton
village
we
passed
one
day
marching
the
plain
for
mile
on
mile
and
crossed
the
bridge
in
single
file
happily
singing
and
marched
away
over
the
bridge
where
the
shallow
races
under
a
clear
and
frosty
sky
and
the
winterbourne
as
we
marched
by
mirrored
a
thousand
laughing
faces
o
do
we
trouble
you
porton
river
we
who
laughing
passed
and
after
found
a
for
laughter
over
here
where
the
poplars
shiver
by
stagnant
waters
we
lie
rotten
on
windless
nights
in
the
lonely
places
there
where
the
winter
water
races
o
porton
river
are
we
forgotten
through
porton
village
under
the
bridge
the
clear
bourne
floweth
with
grasses
trailing
wherein
are
shadows
of
light
cloud
sailing
and
elms
that
shelter
under
the
ridge
the
pale
moon
she
comes
and
looks
over
the
lonely
spire
she
climbs
for
there
she
is
lovelier
many
times
than
in
the
little
broken
brooks
an
old
house
no
one
lives
in
the
old
house
long
ago
the
voices
of
men
and
women
left
it
lonely
they
shuttered
the
sightless
windows
in
a
row
imprisoning
empty
darkness
darkness
only
beyond
the
with
sudden
thunder
the
lumbering
passing
clanks
and
jangles
and
i
a
stranger
peer
with
careless
wonder
into
the
thickets
of
the
garden
tangles
yet
as
i
pass
a
transient
vision
dawns
ghostly
upon
my
pondering
gloom
of
grey
lavender
bushes
and
weedy
lawns
and
a
solitary
in
bloom
no
one
lives
in
the
old
house
year
by
year
the
plaster
crumbles
on
the
lonely
walls
the
apple
falls
in
the
lush
grass
the
pear
pulpy
with
ripeness
on
the
pathway
falls
yet
this
the
garden
was
where
on
spring
nights
under
the
lovers
plighted
have
wondered
at
the
moony
billows
white
dreaming
uncountable
springs
by
love
delighted
whose
ears
have
heard
the
jolly
whistle
the
shadowy
cries
of
bats
in
twilight
flitting
zigzag
beneath
the
eaves
or
on
the
thistle
the
twitter
of
autumn
birds
swinging
and
sitting
whose
eyes
on
winter
evenings
slow
returning
saw
on
the
frosted
paths
pale
lamplight
fall
streaming
or
on
the
hearth
red
embers
burning
and
shadows
of
children
playing
in
the
hall
where
have
they
gone
lovers
of
another
day
no
one
lives
in
the
old
house
long
ago
they
shuttered
the
sightless
windows
where
are
they
whose
eyes
delighted
in
this
moony
snow
i
can
not
tell
and
little
enough
they
care
though
april
spray
the
with
light
and
autumn
pile
her
harvest
unaware
under
the
walls
that
echoed
their
delight
i
can
not
tell
yet
i
am
as
those
lovers
for
me
who
pass
on
my
predestinate
way
the
prodigal
blossom
billows
and
recovers
in
ghostly
gardens
a
hundred
miles
away
yet
in
my
heart
a
melancholy
rapture
tells
me
that
eyes
which
now
an
iron
haste
hurries
to
iron
days
may
here
recapture
a
vision
of
ancient
loveliness
gone
to
waste
the
dhows
south
of
guardafui
with
a
dark
tide
flowing
we
hailed
two
ships
with
tattered
canvas
bent
to
the
monsoon
hung
betwixt
the
outer
sea
and
pale
surf
showing
where
dead
cities
of
libya
lay
bleaching
in
the
moon
whither
be
ye
sailing
with
torn
sails
broken
sail
we
sail
for
sheba
at
behest
with
carven
silver
phalli
for
the
ebony
maids
of
ophir
from
baharias
of
arabia
the
whither
be
ye
sailing
with
your
dark
flag
flying
sail
with
creaking
cedar
towards
the
northern
star
the
helmsman
singeth
wearily
and
in
our
hold
are
lying
a
hundred
slaves
in
shackles
from
the
marts
of
whither
be
ye
sailing
we
sail
no
longer
our
hulls
are
wrack
our
sails
are
dust
as
any
man
might
know
and
why
should
you
torment
us
your
iron
keels
are
stronger
than
ghostly
ships
that
sailed
from
tyre
a
thousand
years
the
gift
marching
on
tanga
marching
the
plain
of
wavering
past
pangani
river
england
came
to
me
me
who
had
always
but
never
given
before
england
the
giver
in
a
vision
of
three
that
shiver
on
still
evenings
of
summer
after
rain
by
slapton
ley
where
start
and
quiver
when
scarce
a
ripple
moves
the
upland
grain
then
i
thanked
god
that
now
i
had
suffered
pain
and
as
the
plain
thirst
and
lain
awake
shivering
all
night
through
till
cold
daybreak
in
that
i
count
these
sufferings
my
gain
and
her
acknowledgment
nay
more
would
fain
suffer
as
many
more
for
her
sweet
sake
five
degrees
south
i
love
all
waves
and
lovely
water
in
motion
that
wavering
iris
in
comb
of
the
blown
spray
iris
of
tumbled
nautilus
in
the
commotion
their
spread
sails
dipped
in
a
marmoreal
way
unquarried
wherein
are
greeny
bubbles
blowing
plumes
of
faint
spray
cool
in
the
deep
and
lucent
seas
that
pause
not
in
their
flowing
to
lap
the
southern
starlight
while
they
sleep
these
i
have
seen
these
i
have
loved
and
known
i
have
seen
jupiter
that
great
star
swinging
like
a
lantern
silent
and
alone
within
his
sea
of
sky
and
heard
the
singing
of
the
south
trade
that
siren
of
the
air
who
shivers
the
taut
shrouds
and
singeth
there
fahrenheit
i
lay
with
fever
in
my
veins
consumed
tormented
creature
of
fire
and
ice
and
weaving
the
device
dreamed
that
for
evermore
i
must
walk
these
plains
where
sunlight
slayeth
life
and
where
no
rains
abated
the
fierce
air
nor
slaked
its
fire
so
that
death
seemed
the
end
of
all
desire
to
ease
the
distracted
body
of
its
pains
and
so
i
died
and
from
my
eyes
the
glare
faded
nor
had
i
further
need
of
breath
but
when
i
reached
my
hand
to
find
you
there
beside
me
i
found
nothing
lonely
was
death
and
with
a
cry
i
wakened
but
to
hear
thin
wings
of
fever
singing
in
my
ear
the
beautiful
acacia
she
sighs
in
desert
lands
over
the
burning
waterways
of
africa
she
sways
and
sways
even
where
no
air
glideth
in
cooling
green
she
stands
the
beautiful
acacia
she
hath
a
yellow
dress
a
slender
trunk
of
lemon
sheen
gleameth
through
the
tender
green
where
the
thorn
hideth
shielding
her
loveliness
the
beautiful
acacia
dwelleth
in
deadly
lands
over
the
brooding
waterways
where
death
breedeth
she
sways
and
sways
and
no
man
long
abideth
in
valleys
where
she
stands
the
high
on
the
tufted
a
sang
to
me
a
simple
song
of
three
notes
only
that
made
the
wilderness
more
lonely
for
in
my
brain
it
echoed
nearly
old
village
church
bells
chiming
clearly
the
sweet
cracked
bells
just
out
of
tune
over
the
mowing
grass
in
june
over
the
mowing
grass
and
meadows
where
the
low
sun
casts
long
shadows
and
cuckoos
call
in
the
twilight
from
elm
to
elm
in
level
flight
now
through
the
evening
meadows
move
slow
couples
of
young
folk
in
love
who
pause
at
every
crooked
stile
and
kiss
in
the
shade
the
while
like
pale
moths
the
summer
frocks
hover
between
the
beds
of
phlox
and
old
men
feeling
it
is
late
cease
their
gossip
at
the
gate
till
deeper
still
the
twilight
grows
and
night
blossometh
like
a
rose
full
of
love
and
sweet
perfume
whose
heart
most
tender
stars
illume
here
the
red
sun
sank
like
lead
and
the
sky
blackened
overhead
only
the
locust
chirped
at
me
from
the
shadowy
moths
when
i
lay
wakeful
yesternight
my
flame
was
a
clear
light
a
taper
flaring
in
the
wind
whither
fluttering
out
of
the
dim
night
many
dreams
glimmered
by
like
moths
out
of
the
darkness
blind
hurling
at
that
flame
from
drinking
honey
of
the
flowers
into
my
circled
light
they
came
so
near
i
could
see
their
soft
colours
grey
of
the
dove
most
soothely
grey
but
my
heat
singed
their
wings
and
away
darting
into
the
dark
again
they
escaped
me
others
floated
down
like
those
vaned
seeds
that
fall
in
autumn
from
the
crown
when
no
leaf
trembleth
nor
branch
is
stirred
more
silent
in
flight
than
any
bird
or
wings
flitting
in
darkness
soft
as
lizards
moving
on
a
white
wall
they
came
quietly
from
aloft
down
through
my
circle
of
light
and
so
into
unlighted
gloom
below
but
one
dream
daring
flew
beating
at
the
heart
of
the
flame
till
i
feared
it
would
have
put
out
my
light
my
thin
taper
fitfully
flaring
and
that
i
should
be
left
alone
in
the
night
with
no
more
dreams
for
my
delight
can
it
be
that
from
the
dead
even
their
dreams
their
dreams
are
fled
bête
humaine
riding
through
ruwu
swamp
about
sunrise
i
saw
the
world
awake
and
as
the
ray
touched
the
tall
grasses
where
they
dream
till
day
lo
the
bright
air
alive
with
dragonflies
with
brittle
wings
aquiver
and
great
eyes
piloting
crimson
bodies
slender
and
gay
i
aimed
at
one
and
struck
it
and
it
lay
broken
and
lifeless
with
dyes
then
my
soul
sickened
with
a
sudden
pain
and
horror
at
my
own
careless
cruelty
that
where
all
things
are
cruel
i
had
slain
a
creature
whose
sweet
life
it
is
to
fly
like
beasts
that
prey
with
bloody
claw
nay
they
must
slay
to
live
but
what
excuse
had
i
doves
on
the
edge
of
the
grey
doves
fluttering
grey
doves
of
astarte
to
the
woods
at
daybreak
lazily
uttering
their
murmured
enchantment
old
as
childhood
while
she
pale
divinity
of
hidden
evil
silvers
the
regions
chaste
of
cold
sky
and
broodeth
over
forests
primeval
and
all
that
thorny
wooded
infinity
goddess
of
groves
cried
i
enchanted
sinister
recesses
of
these
lone
shades
may
still
be
haunted
by
thy
demon
caresses
thy
unholy
loves
but
clear
day
quelleth
her
dominion
lonely
and
the
soft
murmuring
telleth
that
dark
sin
only
from
lust
springeth
in
heart
dwelleth
song
i
made
a
song
in
my
likeness
from
colours
of
my
quietude
from
trees
whose
blossoms
shine
no
less
than
butterflies
in
the
i
laid
claim
on
all
beauty
under
the
sun
to
praise
her
wonder
till
the
noise
of
war
swept
over
me
my
singing
mouth
with
thunder
the
angel
of
death
hath
swift
wings
i
heard
him
strip
the
huddled
trees
overhead
as
a
hornet
sings
and
whip
the
grass
about
my
knees
down
we
crouched
in
the
parchèd
dust
down
beneath
that
deadly
rain
dead
still
i
lay
as
lie
one
must
who
hath
a
bullet
in
his
brain
dead
they
left
me
but
my
soul
waking
quietly
laughed
at
their
distress
who
guessed
not
that
i
still
was
making
that
new
song
in
my
likeness
before
action
now
the
wind
of
the
dawn
sighs
now
red
embers
have
burned
white
under
the
darkness
faints
and
dies
the
heart
of
night
into
the
darkness
my
eyes
peer
seeing
only
faces
and
level
eyes
that
know
not
fear
yet
each
heart
is
a
battlefield
where
phantom
armies
foin
and
feint
and
bloody
victories
are
won
from
the
time
when
stars
are
faint
to
the
rising
of
the
sun
with
banners
broken
and
the
roll
of
drums
at
dawn
the
phantoms
fly
a
man
must
commune
with
his
soul
when
he
marches
out
to
die
o
day
of
wrath
and
of
desire
for
each
may
know
upon
this
day
whether
he
be
a
thing
of
fire
or
fettered
to
the
traitor
clay
such
is
the
hazard
that
is
thrown
we
know
not
how
the
dice
may
fall
all
the
secrets
shall
be
known
or
else
we
shall
not
know
at
all
on
a
subaltern
killed
in
action
into
that
dry
and
most
desolate
place
with
heavy
gait
they
dragged
the
stretcher
in
and
laid
him
on
the
bloody
ground
the
din
of
maxim
fire
ceased
not
i
raised
his
head
and
looked
into
his
face
and
saw
that
he
was
dead
saw
beneath
matted
curls
the
broken
skin
that
let
the
bullet
in
and
saw
the
limp
lithe
limbs
the
smiling
mouth
ah
may
we
smile
at
death
as
bravely
the
lips
that
no
more
drouth
should
blacken
and
no
sweetly
stirring
breath
mildly
displace
so
i
covered
the
calm
face
and
stripped
the
shirt
from
his
firm
breast
and
there
a
zinc
identity
disc
a
bracelet
of
elephant
hair
i
found
ah
god
how
deep
it
stings
this
unendurable
pity
of
small
things
but
more
than
this
i
saw
that
dead
stranger
welcoming
more
than
the
raw
and
brutal
havoc
of
war
england
i
saw
the
mother
from
whose
side
he
came
hither
and
died
she
at
whose
hems
he
had
in
whose
quiet
womb
his
body
and
soul
were
made
that
pale
estrangèd
flesh
that
we
bowed
over
had
breathed
the
scent
in
summer
of
white
clover
dreamed
her
cool
fading
nights
her
twilights
long
and
days
as
careless
as
a
song
heard
in
the
hush
of
eve
when
wings
make
a
thin
music
and
the
spins
for
it
is
summer
i
thought
in
england
now
and
once
those
forward
gazing
eyes
had
seen
her
lovely
living
green
that
blackened
brow
cool
airs
from
those
blue
hills
moving
had
breath
of
that
holy
land
whither
my
soul
aspireth
without
despair
in
the
broken
brain
had
many
a
lovely
word
awakened
magical
echoes
of
things
heard
telling
of
love
and
laughter
and
low
voices
and
tales
in
which
the
english
heart
rejoices
in
vanishing
visions
of
childhood
and
its
glories
nursery
rhymes
and
fairy
stories
words
that
only
an
english
tongue
could
tell
and
the
firing
died
away
and
the
night
fell
on
our
battle
only
in
the
sullen
sky
a
prairie
fire
with
huge
fantastic
flame
leapt
lighting
dark
clouds
charged
with
thunder
and
my
heart
was
sick
with
shame
that
there
in
death
he
should
lie
crying
why
am
i
alive
i
wonder
in
a
dream
i
saw
war
riding
the
land
stark
rode
she
with
bowed
eyes
against
the
glare
of
cities
smouldering
in
the
dark
a
tired
horse
lean
with
outreaching
head
and
hid
her
face
of
dread
yet
in
my
passion
would
i
look
on
her
crying
o
hark
thou
pale
one
whom
now
men
say
bearest
the
scythe
of
god
that
iron
scythe
forged
by
his
thunder
for
reaping
of
nations
overripened
fashioned
upon
the
clanging
anvil
whose
sparks
flying
in
a
starry
night
dying
fall
hereunder
but
she
she
heeded
not
my
cry
impassioned
nor
turned
her
face
of
dread
urging
the
tired
horse
with
outreaching
head
o
thou
cried
i
who
choosest
for
thy
going
these
bloomy
meadows
of
youth
these
flowery
ways
whereby
no
influence
strays
ruder
than
a
cold
wind
blowing
or
beating
needles
of
rain
why
must
thou
ride
again
ruthless
among
the
pastures
yet
unripened
crushing
their
beauty
in
thine
iron
track
downtrodden
in
thy
following
flame
parched
and
black
but
she
she
stayed
not
in
her
weary
haste
nor
turned
her
face
but
fled
and
where
she
passed
the
lands
lay
waste
and
now
i
can
not
tell
whither
she
rideth
but
tired
tired
rides
she
yet
know
i
well
why
her
dread
face
she
hideth
she
is
pale
and
faint
to
death
yea
her
day
faileth
nor
all
her
blood
nor
all
her
frenzy
burning
nor
all
her
hate
availeth
for
she
passeth
out
of
sight
into
that
night
from
which
none
none
returneth
to
waste
the
meadows
of
youth
nor
vex
thine
eyelids
routhe
o
sorrowful
sister
soother
of
our
sorrow
and
a
hope
within
me
springs
that
fair
will
be
the
morrow
and
that
charred
plain
those
flowery
meadows
shall
rejoice
at
last
in
a
sweet
clean
freshness
as
when
the
green
grass
springeth
where
the
prairie
fire
hath
passed
after
action
all
through
that
day
of
battle
the
broken
sound
of
shattering
maxim
fire
made
mad
the
wood
so
that
the
low
trees
shuddered
where
they
stood
and
echoes
bellowed
in
the
bush
around
but
when
at
last
the
light
of
day
was
drowned
that
madness
ceased
ah
god
but
it
was
good
there
in
the
reek
of
iodine
and
blood
i
flung
me
down
upon
the
thorny
ground
so
quiet
was
it
i
might
well
have
been
lying
in
a
room
i
love
where
the
ivy
cluster
shakes
its
dew
upon
the
lattice
panes
at
even
where
rusty
ivory
scatters
from
the
dying
jessamine
blossom
and
the
breaks
her
dusky
bloom
beneath
a
summer
heaven

not
only
for
remembered
loveliness

my
mother
my
own
we
hold
thee
rare
who
toil
and
fight
and
sicken
beneath
the
glare
of
brazen
skies
that
smile
on
our
duress
making
us
crave
thy
cloudy
state
no
less
than
the
sweet
clarity
of
thy
air
meadows
in
moonlight
cool
and
every
fair
flower
of
thy
summer
dress
not
for
thy
flowers
but
for
the
unfading
crown
of
sacrifice
our
happy
brothers
wove
thee
the
joyous
ones
who
laid
thy
beauty
down
nor
stayed
to
see
it
shamed
for
these
we
love
thee
for
this
o
love
o
dread
we
hold
thee
more
divinely
fair
than
heretofore
a
farewell
to

now
once
again
upon
the
bearing
we
plough
these
furrowed
fields
where
no
blade
springeth
again
the
busy
trade
in
the
halyards
singeth
spindrift
from
the
blown
wave
shearing
the
uncomplaining
sea
suffers
our
faring
in
a
brazen
glitter
our
little
wake
is
lost
and
the
starry
south
rolls
over
until
no
ghost
remaineth
of
us
and
all
our
pitiful
daring
for
the
sea
beareth
no
trace
of
endeavour
his
might
enarmoured
his
prosperous
argosies
soundless
within
her
unsounded
caves
forever
she
broodeth
knowing
neither
war
nor
peace
and
our
grey
cruisers
holds
in
mind
no
more
than
the
cedarn
fleets
that
treasure
bore
song
what
is
the
worth
of
war
in
a
world
that
turneth
turneth
about
a
tired
star
whose
flaming
centre
burneth
no
longer
than
the
space
of
the
spent
race
where
conquered
lands
soon
soon
lie
waste
as
the
pale
moon
what
is
the
worth
of
art
in
a
world
that
fast
forgetteth
those
who
have
wrung
its
heart
with
beauty
that
love
begetteth
whose
faint
flames
vanish
quite
in
that
night
where
even
the
mighty
ones
shine
only
as
far
suns
and
what
is
beauty
worth
sweet
beauty
that
persuadeth
of
her
immortal
birth
then
as
a
flower
fadeth
or
love
whose
tender
years
end
with
the
tears
die
when
the
breath
is
quiet
at
last
in
death
beauty
and
love
are
one
even
when
fierce
war
clashes
even
when
our
fiery
sun
hath
burnt
itself
to
ashes
and
the
dead
planets
race
unlighted
through
blind
space
beauty
will
still
shine
there
wherefore
i
worship
her
the
hawthorn
spray
i
saw
a
thrush
light
on
a
hawthorn
spray
one
moment
only
spilling
creamy
blossom
while
the
bough
bent
beneath
her
speckled
bosom
bent
and
recovered
and
she
fluttered
away
the
branch
was
still
but
in
my
heart
a
pain
than
the
spray
more
cruel
stabbed
me
only
remembering
days
in
a
far
land
and
lonely
when
i
had
never
hoped
for
summer
again
the
pavement
in
bitter
heart
of
stone
under
the
shielded
glare
i
saw
a
body
thrown
unto
the
drabs
that
traffic
there
pacing
the
pavements
with
slow
feet
those
old
pavements
whose
blown
dust
throttles
the
hot
air
of
the
street
and
the
darkness
smells
of
lust
the
chaste
moon
with
equal
glance
looked
down
on
the
mad
world
astare
at
those
who
conquered
in
sad
france
and
those
who
perished
in
leicester
square
and
in
her
light
his
lips
were
pale
lips
that
love
had
moulded
well
out
of
the
jaws
of
passchendaele
they
had
sent
him
to
this
nether
hell
i
had
no
stone
of
scorn
to
fling
for
i
know
not
how
the
wrong
began
but
i
had
seen
a
hateful
thing
masked
in
the
dignity
of
man
and
hate
and
sorrow
and
hopeless
anger
swept
my
heart
as
the
winds
that
sweep
angrily
through
the
leafless
hanger
when
winter
rises
from
the
deep
i
would
that
war
were
what
men
dream
a
crackling
fire
a
cleansing
flame
that
it
might
leap
the
space
between
and
lap
up
london
and
its
shame
to
lydia
lopokova
her
garland
o
thou
who
comest
to
our
wintry
shade
gay
and
as
the
virgin
spring
before
whose
shining
feet
the
cherries
fling
their
moony
tribute
when
the
sloe
is
sprayed
with
light
and
all
things
musical
are
made
o
thou
who
art
daughter
who
can
bring
blossom
or
song
of
bird
or
anything
to
match
the
youth
in
which
you
stand
arrayed
not
that
rich
garland
meleager
twined
in
his
glade
above
the
blue
that
flashes
from
the
burning
tyrian
seas
no
you
are
cooler
sweeter
than
the
wind
that
wakes
our
woodlands
so
i
bring
to
you
these
blossoms
of
anemones
her
variety
soft
as
a
pale
moth
flitting
in
moonshine
i
saw
thee
flutter
to
the
shadowy
call
that
beckons
from
the
strings
of
carneval
o
frail
and
fragrant
image
of
columbine
so
when
the
spectre
of
the
rose
was
thine
a
flower
wert
thou
and
last
i
saw
thee
fall
in
stormy
bacchanal
flown
with
the
red
insurgence
of
the
vine
o
moth
o
flower
o
mænad
which
art
thou
shadowy
beautiful
or
leaping
wild
as
stormlight
over
savage
tartar
skies
such
were
my
ancient
questionings
but
now
i
know
that
you
are
nothing
but
a
child
with
a
red
mouth
and
hazel
eyes
her
swiftness
you
are
too
swift
for
poetry
too
fleet
for
any
musèd
numbers
to
ensnare
swifter
than
music
dying
on
the
air
or
bloom
upon
fades
the
sweet
vanishing
magic
of
your
flying
feet
your
poisèd
finger
and
your
shining
hair
words
can
not
tell
how
wonderful
you
were
or
how
one
gesture
made
a
joy
complete
and
since
you
know
my
pen
may
never
capture
the
transient
swift
loveliness
of
you
come
let
us
salve
our
sense
of
the
loss
remembering
with
a
melancholy
rapture
how
many
and
poets
too
dream
in
the
dust
of
hecatompylos
ghostly
loves
why
my
darling
prayeth
me
you
sing
for
ever
of
ghostly
loves
phantasmal
passion
seeing
that
you
never
loved
me
after
that
fashion
and
the
love
i
gave
was
not
a
phantom
thing
but
delight
of
eager
lips
and
strong
arms
folding
the
beauty
of
yielding
arms
and
of
smooth
shoulder
all
fluent
grace
of
which
you
were
the
moulder
and
i
oh
i
was
happy
for
your
do
you
not
know
my
dearest
have
you
not
seen
the
shadow
that
broodeth
over
things
that
perish
how
age
may
mock
sweet
moments
that
have
been
and
death
defile
the
beauty
that
we
cherish
wherefore
sweet
spirit
i
thank
thee
for
thy
giving
my
spirit
that
embraceth
thee
dead
or
february
the
robin
on
my
lawn
he
was
the
first
to
tell
how
in
the
frozen
dawn
this
miracle
befell
waking
the
meadows
white
with
hoar
the
iron
road
agleam
with
splintered
light
and
ice
where
water
flowed
till
when
the
low
sun
drank
those
milky
mists
that
cloak
hanger
and
hollied
bank
the
winter
world
awoke
to
hear
the
feeble
bleat
of
lambs
on
downland
farms
a
blackbird
whistled
sweet
old
beeches
moved
their
arms
into
a
mellow
haze
aerial
and
i
alone
agaze
stood
waiting
for
the
thorn
to
break
in
blossom
white
or
burst
in
a
green
flame
so
in
a
single
night
fair
february
came
bidding
my
lips
to
sing
or
whisper
their
surprise
with
all
the
joy
of
spring
and
morning
in
her
eyes
song
of
the
dark
ages
we
digged
our
trenches
on
the
down
beside
old
barrows
and
the
wet
white
chalk
we
shovelled
from
below
it
lay
like
drifts
of
thawing
snow
on
parados
and
parapet
until
a
pick
neither
struck
flint
nor
split
the
yielding
chalky
soil
but
only
calcined
human
bone
poor
relic
of
that
age
of
stone
whose
ossuary
was
our
spoil
home
we
marched
singing
in
the
rain
and
all
the
while
beneath
our
song
i
mused
how
many
springs
should
wane
and
still
our
trenches
scar
the
plain
the
monument
of
an
old
wrong
but
then
i
thought
the
fair
green
sod
will
wholly
cover
that
white
stain
and
soften
as
it
clothes
the
face
of
those
old
barrows
every
trace
of
violence
to
the
patient
plain
and
careless
people
passing
by
will
speak
of
both
in
casual
tone
saying
see
the
toil
they
made
the
age
of
iron
pick
and
spade
here
jostles
with
the
age
of
yet
either
from
that
happier
race
will
merit
but
a
passing
glance
and
they
will
leave
us
both
alone
poor
savages
who
wrought
in
stone
poor
savages
who
fought
in
france
winter
sunset
athwart
the
blackening
bars
of
pines
benighted
the
sun
descending
to
the
zones
of
denser
cloud
that
the
long
horizon
lighted
upon
the
crown
of
earth
a
flaming
censer
from
which
white
clouds
of
incense
overflowing
filled
the
chill
clarity
from
whence
the
swallows
had
lately
fled
with
wreathèd
vapours
showing
like
a
fine
bloom
over
the
lonely
fallows
where
with
the
pungent
breath
of
mist
was
blended
a
faint
aroma
of
sodden
by
autumn
rains
and
fainter
still
ascended
beneath
high
woods
the
scent
of
leaves
downtrodden
it
was
a
moment
when
the
earth
that
sickened
for
spring
as
lover
when
the
beloved
lingers
lay
breathless
while
the
distant
goddess
quickened
some
southern
with
her
glowing
fingers
and
so
it
seemed
the
drowsy
lands
were
shaken
stirred
in
their
sleep
and
sighed
as
though
the
pain
of
a
strange
dream
had
bidden
them
awaken
to
frozen
days
and
bitter
nights
again
song
why
have
you
stolen
my
delight
in
all
the
golden
shows
of
spring
when
every
is
white
and
in
the
limes
the
thrushes
sing
o
fickler
than
the
april
day
o
brighter
than
the
golden
broom
o
blyther
than
the
lay
o
whiter
than
the
o
sweeter
than
all
things
that
blow
why
have
you
only
left
for
me
the
broom
the
crown
of
snow
and
thrushes
in
the
england
april
last
night
the
north
flew
at
the
throat
of
spring
with
spite
to
tear
her
greening
banners
down
tossing
the
tender
tassels
brown
the
virgin
blossom
of
sloe
burdening
with
colder
snow
beneath
his
frosty
sting
patient
the
woods
were
bowed
by
drownèd
fields
where
stormy
waters
flowed
yet
on
the
thorn
i
heard
a
blackbird
sing
late
too
late
he
sang
wintry
spite
for
molten
snow
will
feed
the
springing
grass
the
tide
of
life
it
floweth
with
the
o
england
england
thou
that
standest
upright
against
the
tide
of
death
the
bad
days
pass
know
by
this
miracle
that
summer
is
near
slender
themes
when
by
a
happier
race
these
leaves
are
turned
wonder
that
such
quiet
themes
engaged
a
mind
when
noisy
wars
were
waged
and
half
the
world
in
one
red
bonfire
burned
that
fierce
age
say
up
in
flame
he
lived
or
died
seeing
those
bright
deeds
done
whereby
our
sweet
and
settled
peace
was
won
yet
offereth
slender
dreams
not
deeds
to
then
say
of
the
heart
the
mouth
speaketh
and
mine
was
as
the
hearts
of
other
men
whom
those
dark
days
impassioned
yet
it
seeketh
to
paint
the
sombre
woes
that
held
us
then
no
more
than
the
light
seeks
to
illumine
the
sad
skies
of
invocation
whither
o
my
sweet
mistress
must
i
follow
thee
for
when
i
hear
thy
distant
footfall
nearing
and
wait
on
thy
appearing
lo
my
lips
are
silent
no
words
come
to
me
once
i
waylaid
thee
in
green
forest
covers
hoping
that
spring
might
free
my
lips
with
gentle
fingers
alas
her
presence
lingers
no
longer
than
on
the
plain
the
shadow
of
brown
kestrel
hovers
through
windless
ways
of
the
night
my
spirit
followed
after
cold
and
remote
were
they
and
there
possessed
by
a
strange
unworldly
rest
awaiting
thy
still
voice
heard
only
starry
laughter
the
pillared
halls
of
sleep
echoed
my
ghostly
tread
yet
when
their
secret
chambers
i
essayed
my
spirit
sank
dismayed
waking
in
fear
to
find
the
vision
fled
once
indeed
but
then
my
spirit
bloomed
in
leafy
rapture
i
loved
and
once
i
looked
death
in
the
eyes
so
suddenly
made
wise
spoke
of
such
beauty
as
i
may
never
recapture
whither
o
divine
mistress
must
i
then
follow
thee
is
it
only
in
love
say
is
it
only
in
death
that
the
spirit
blossometh
and
words
that
may
match
my
vision
shall
come
to
me
thamar
thamar
once
in
the
sombre
light
of
the
courts
of
night
in
a
land
only
inhabited
by
the
unhappy
dead
came
one
who
anxious
eyed
clung
to
my
idle
hand
with
clenched
fingers
weak
and
gazed
into
my
eyes
as
he
had
wrongs
to
speak
silent
he
stood
and
wan
more
pallid
than
the
leaves
of
an
aspen
blown
under
a
wind
that
grieves
then
i
haggard
one
say
from
what
ghostly
zone
of
thwarted
destinies
or
torment
hast
thou
come
tell
me
thy
race
and
name
and
he
with
veiled
face
have
neither
name
nor
race
but
i
have
travelled
far
a
timeless
avatar
of
dooms
out
of
those
tyrannous
glooms
where
like
a
tired
star
in
stormy
darkness
looms
the
castle
of
thamar
once
in
a
lonely
dawn
my
eager
spirit
fared
by
ways
that
no
men
dared
unto
a
desert
land
where
on
a
sullen
strand
a
mouldering
city
vast
as
towered
babylon
stood
in
the
dreamy
sand
older
a
million
years
babel
was
builded
on
that
broken
tears
dust
of
her
crumbled
past
rose
from
the
rapid
wheels
of
charioteers
in
whorled
clouds
above
those
shining
thoroughfares
where
millions
tread
on
her
unheeding
dead
forth
from
an
eastern
gate
where
the
lips
of
asia
wait
with
an
ancient
thirst
that
no
æons
can
abate
passed
i
predestinate
to
a
drought
where
the
rivers
of
the
south
flowing
in
a
cloudy
spate
spend
at
last
their
splendid
strength
in
a
sea
of
molten
glass
seething
with
the
brazen
might
of
a
white
sun
dipped
at
length
like
a
baked
stone
burning
hot
plunged
in
a
hissing
pot
out
of
that
solemn
portal
over
the
tawny
waste
without
stay
without
haste
nor
the
joy
of
any
mortal
glance
of
eye
or
clasp
of
hand
desolate
in
a
burning
land
lonely
days
and
nights
i
travelled
and
the
changing
seasons
squandered
friendless
endlessly
i
wandered
nor
my
woven
fate
unravelled
drawn
to
a
hidden
goal
sore
forlorn
with
waiting
seeking
i
knew
not
what
yet
unhesitating
struggled
my
hapless
soul
there
in
a
thousand
springs
slow
beneath
frozen
snow
where
the
blind
earth
lay
cringing
have
i
seen
the
steppe
unfold
uncounted
blossomings
where
salty
pools
shone
fair
in
a
quivering
blue
air
that
shivered
every
fringing
with
cool
delight
and
fanned
the
mazy
flight
of
egrets
white
beating
and
wheeling
bright
against
the
sun
astare
but
i
could
not
hear
their
wings
for
they
were
ghostly
things
sent
by
the
powers
of
night
to
mock
my
sufferings
and
rain
upon
the
bitter
waterpools
their
drops
aglitter
yet
when
these
lakes
accursed
tortured
my
aching
thirst
the
green
reeds
fell
to
dust
the
cool
pools
to
a
crust
of
frozen
salt
crystallised
to
taunt
my
broken
lips
to
cheat
my
staring
eyes
as
a
vision
of
great
ships
with
moving
towers
of
sail
poops
with
grinning
crowds
and
a
wind
in
their
shrouds
bears
down
upon
the
pale
wasted
castaway
afloat
with
the
salt
in
his
throat
and
a
feeble
wild
desire
to
be
quenched
of
his
fire
in
the
green
gloom
beneath
so
again
and
again
hath
a
phantom
city
thrust
to
the
visionary
vault
of
inviolate
cobalt
dome
and
dreaming
minaret
mosque
and
gleaming
hazy
in
a
jet
or
a
rising
dust
and
my
lips
have
cried
aloud
to
see
them
tremble
there
though
i
knew
within
my
heart
they
were
chiselled
out
of
cloud
or
carven
of
thin
air
and
my
fingers
clenched
my
hand
for
i
wondered
if
this
land
of
my
stony
pilgrimage
were
a
glimmering
mirage
and
i
myself
no
more
than
a
phantom
of
the
sand
beyond
these
fading
slender
cities
many
leagues
away
strange
brooding
mountains
lay
heaped
crowding
range
on
range
in
a
changing
cloudy
splendour
and
beyond
in
lakes
of
light
as
eastward
still
i
staggered
there
swam
into
my
sight
more
vast
and
hoar
and
haggard
shoulders
of
ice
and
snow
bounding
the
heavens
low
of
burnished
brass
whereunder
the
hot
plains
of
cathay
perpetually
slumber
where
tawny
millions
breed
in
cities
without
number
whither
a
thunder
rolling
on
tartary
with
torrents
and
lightning
swelleth
the
yellow
river
to
a
tumult
of
whitening
foam
and
confusèd
might
that
drowns
in
a
single
night
many
a
city
and
cities
of
boats
and
frail
cities
of
lath
and
reed
are
whirled
away
without
pity
or
set
afloat
in
a
pale
swirling
shallow
sea
and
their
names
seem
lost
for
ever
till
a
stranger
nomad
race
drive
their
herds
to
the
sad
place
where
old
sorrows
lie
forgotten
and
raise
upon
the
rotten
level
waste
another
brood
to
await
another
flood
i
never
might
attain
to
this
melancholy
plain
for
the
mountains
rose
between
stark
in
my
path
they
lay
between
me
and
cathay
through
moving
mist
and
i
knew
that
they
were
real
for
their
drooping
folds
of
cloud
enwrapped
me
in
a
shroud
and
the
air
that
fell
at
night
from
their
frozen
summits
white
slid
like
an
steel
into
my
living
breast
and
stilled
the
heart
within
as
the
chill
of
an
old
sin
that
robs
a
man
of
rest
killing
all
delight
in
the
silence
of
the
night
and
brooding
black
above
till
the
heart
dare
not
move
but
lieth
cold
and
numb
and
the
dawn
will
not
come
to
me
a
dawn
came
in
cold
flame
flinging
the
imminence
of
those
inviolate
snows
on
the
forest
lawns
below
in
a
shadow
more
immense
than
their
eternal
vastness
and
a
new
hope
beyond
reason
flamed
in
my
dark
season
dazzled
my
pallid
eyes
till
when
the
hot
sun
soared
above
the
uttermost
height
a
draught
of
keen
delight
into
my
body
was
poured
for
all
that
frozen
fastness
lay
flowered
with
the
spring
her
starry
blossoms
broke
beneath
my
bruisèd
feet
and
their
beauty
was
so
sweet
to
me
i
kissed
them
where
they
lay
yea
i
bent
my
weary
hips
and
kissed
them
with
dry
lips
tenderly
only
dreading
lest
their
petals
delicate
should
be
broken
by
my
treading
for
i
lived
i
lived
again
and
my
heart
would
have
been
broken
by
a
living
pain
so
i
kissed
them
for
a
token
of
my
joy
in
their
new
birth
and
i
kissed
the
gentle
earth
slowly
the
shadows
crept
to
the
bases
of
the
crags
and
i
slept
in
another
life
had
i
remembered
sleep
when
tired
children
creep
on
to
their
knees
and
there
a
dreamless
peace
more
quietly
descendeth
than
gentle
evening
endeth
or
fold
their
wings
before
the
nightjar
spins
or
the
nightingale
begins
when
the
brooding
hedgerow
trees
where
they
nest
lie
awake
and
breathe
so
soft
they
shake
not
a
single
shuddering
leaf
lest
the
silence
should
break
sleep
have
i
known
deeper
beyond
belief
when
straining
limbs
relax
after
hot
human
toil
in
yellow
harvest
fields
where
the
panting
earth
yields
a
smell
of
baked
soil
and
the
dust
of
dry
stubbles
blows
over
the
whitening
shocks
of
lank
grain
and
bundles
of
flax
and
men
fling
themselves
down
forgetting
their
troubles
unheedful
of
the
song
that
the
landrail
weaves
along
misty
woodlands
or
lightning
that
the
pale
sky
laves
like
phosphorescent
waves
washing
summer
seas
and
more
beautiful
than
these
that
sleep
of
dazèd
wonder
when
love
has
torn
asunder
the
veils
of
the
sky
and
raptured
lovers
lie
faint
in
each
arms
beneath
a
heaven
strewn
with
myriad
starry
swarms
where
planets
float
like
lonely
nenuphars
in
pools
of
the
sky
yet
when
they
wake
they
turn
from
those
burning
galaxies
seeking
heaven
only
in
each
eyes
and
sigh
and
sleep
again
for
while
they
sleep
they
seem
to
forget
the
pain
and
when
they
wake
they
dream
other
sleep
was
mine
as
i
had
drunk
of
wine
with
bitter
hemlock
or
sousèd
with
the
heapèd
milky
poppyheads
a
drowsy
tartar
treads
where
slow
waters
sweep
over
red
river
beds
and
the
air
is
heavy
with
sleep
so
when
i
woke
at
last
the
labouring
earth
had
rolled
eastward
under
the
vast
dominion
of
night
funereal
forlorn
as
that
unlighted
chamber
wherein
she
first
was
born
bereft
of
all
starlight
pale
silver
of
the
moon
or
the
low
amber
to
my
queen
i
prayed
grave
ashtoreth
whose
shade
hallows
the
dim
abyss
of
heliopolis
where
many
an
olive
maid
clashed
kissing
syrian
cymbals
and
timbrels
shivered
through
the
vale
o
lovely
and
o
white
under
the
holy
night
is
their
gleaming
wonder
and
their
brows
are
pale
as
the
new
risen
moon
dancing
till
they
swoon
in
far
forests
under
desolate
lebanon
while
the
flame
of
pyre
reddens
the
cloud
that
overshadows
tyre
so
when
i
cried
aloud
behold
a
torch
of
fire
leapt
on
the
bright
o
beautiful
for
never
kindlier
light
fell
on
the
darkened
sight
of
mortal
eyes
and
dull
since
that
devoted
one
whom
gloomy
caucasus
in
icy
silence
lonely
bound
to
his
cruel
shoulders
brought
to
benighted
men
in
a
hollow
sparks
of
the
torrid
vapour
that
burned
behind
the
bars
of
evening
broke
rose
or
smouldered
in
the
stars
or
lit
the
taper
or
wavered
over
the
fen
or
tipped
the
javelin
of
the
levin
lash
of
the
lord
of
heaven
and
bitter
scourge
of
sin
o
beautiful
o
bright
my
tired
sinews
strained
to
this
torch
that
flared
and
waned
as
a
watery
planet
gloweth
and
waneth
in
the
night
when
a
calm
sea
floweth
under
a
misty
sky
spread
with
the
tattered
veils
of
rapid
cloud
driven
over
the
deeps
of
heaven
by
winds
that
range
too
high
to
sweep
the
languid
sails
on
through
the
frozen
night
like
a
blind
moth
flying
with
battered
wing
and
bruisèd
bloom
into
a
light
i
dragged
my
ragged
limbs
cared
not
if
i
were
dying
knew
not
if
i
were
dead
where
cavernous
crevasses
and
stony
desperate
passes
snared
waylaid
my
tread
in
the
roar
of
broken
boulders
split
from
rocky
shoulders
in
the
thunder
of
snow
sliding
or
under
the
appalling
rending
of
glacier
ice
or
hoarse
cataracts
falling
and
i
knew
not
what
could
save
me
but
the
unholy
guiding
that
some
demon
gave
me
thrice
i
fell
and
thrice
in
torrents
of
blue
and
was
like
a
dead
leaf
or
a
ghost
harried
by
thin
bufferings
of
wind
downward
to
tartarus
at
daybreak
downward
to
the
regions
of
the
lost
but
the
rushing
waters
ceased
and
the
bitter
wind
fell
how
i
can
not
tell
unless
that
i
had
come
to
the
hollow
heart
of
the
storm
where
the
wind
is
dumb
and
there
my
gelid
blood
thawed
glowed
and
grew
warm
while
a
form
caught
at
my
arm
and
stayed
and
held
me
as
i
swayed
until
at
last
i
saw
in
a
strange
unworldly
awe
at
the
gate
of
light
i
stood
and
i
entered
alone
a
cavern
of
stone
carven
and
in
the
midst
a
brazier
that
hissed
with
tongued
flames
leaping
over
whitened
embers
of
gummy
frankincense
into
a
fume
of
dense
and
fragrant
vapour
creeping
over
the
roof
to
spread
a
milky
coverlet
softer
than
the
woof
of
webby
net
but
never
spider
yet
spun
a
more
delicate
wonder
than
that
which
hung
thereunder
drooping
fold
on
fold
silks
that
glowed
with
fire
of
tawny
oxus
gold
richer
than
ever
flowed
from
the
eager
fancy
of
man
in
his
vain
desire
for
beauty
that
endures
and
on
the
floor
were
spread
by
many
a
heaped
daiwan
carpets
of
kurdistan
cured
skins
and
encrusted
with
such
gems
as
emperors
of
hind
swart
conquerors
long
dead
sought
for
their
diadems
no
other
light
was
there
but
one
torch
flaring
against
a
square
of
sky
by
the
wind
and
never
another
sound
but
the
tongued
flames
creeping
last
my
eyes
staring
into
the
clouded
gloom
saw
that
the
caverned
room
with
shadowy
forms
was
strewn
in
heavy
sleep
or
swoon
fallen
who
did
not
move
but
lay
as
mortals
lie
in
the
sweet
release
of
love
and
stark
between
them
stood
huge
eunuchs
of
ebony
mute
motionless
as
they
had
been
carven
of
black
wood
but
these
i
scarcely
saw
for
through
the
flame
was
seen
another
a
queen
with
heavy
closèd
eyes
white
against
the
skies
of
that
empurpled
night
in
her
loveliness
she
lay
and
leaned
upon
her
hand
and
my
blood
leapt
at
the
sight
so
that
i
could
not
stand
but
fell
upon
my
knees
pleading
and
cried
aloud
for
her
white
loveliness
as
ixion
for
his
cloud
and
my
cry
the
silence
broke
and
the
sleepers
awoke
from
their
slumber
stirred
and
rose
every
one
save
those
mute
eunuchs
of
ebony
those
frowning
caryatides
slowly
she
looked
at
me
and
when
i
cried
again
in
yearning
and
in
pain
she
beckoned
with
her
hand
then
from
my
knees
rose
i
and
greatly
daring
through
the
hazy
air
past
the
brazier
flaring
and
the
hissing
flame
crept
until
i
came
unto
the
carven
seat
and
kissed
her
white
feet
and
she
smiled
but
spake
not
when
she
smiled
the
sleepers
wavered
as
the
grass
of
a
cornfield
wavers
when
the
ears
are
swept
by
the
breath
of
brown
reapers
singing
as
they
pass
or
grass
of
woody
glades
when
a
wind
that
has
slept
wakens
and
invades
their
moonlit
solitude
when
the
hazels
shiver
and
the
birch
is
blown
to
a
billow
of
silver
but
oaks
in
the
wood
stand
firm
nor
quiver
stand
firm
as
stone
so
amid
the
sleepers
the
black
eunuchs
stood
when
the
sleepers
stirred
faintly
in
the
heat
of
that
painted
room
a
silken
sound
i
heard
and
a
thin
music
sweet
as
the
brown
nightingale
sings
in
the
jealous
shade
of
a
lonely
spinney
stranger
far
than
any
music
mortal
made
fell
softer
than
the
dew
falleth
when
stars
are
pale
sweet
it
was
and
clear
as
light
or
as
the
tears
that
sad
narcissus
wears
in
the
spring
of
the
year
on
barren
mountain
ranges
where
rain
falls
cool
and
every
lonely
pool
is
sprayed
with
broken
light
so
cool
so
beautiful
and
so
divinely
strange
i
doubted
if
it
came
from
any
marshy
reed
or
hollow
fluting
stem
by
the
hands
of
men
unless
it
were
indeed
that
airy
fugitive
syrinx
who
cried
and
ran
before
the
laughing
eyes
of
pan
and
must
for
ever
live
a
shadowy
green
reed
by
an
arcadian
river
but
never
music
made
of
reedy
daughter
or
singing
more
sweet
than
that
which
stole
slow
as
amber
honey
wells
from
the
honeycomb
into
my
weary
soul
with
solace
and
strange
peace
so
trembling
as
i
lay
in
a
dream
more
desolate
than
is
the
darkened
day
of
the
north
i
heard
the
voice
of
one
who
sang
in
a
strange
tongue
and
i
know
not
what
he
sang
save
that
he
sang
of
love
the
while
they
led
me
forth
unheeding
till
we
came
unto
a
chamber
lit
with
one
flame
that
yellow
horn
bedims
and
laid
me
down
and
there
they
soothed
my
bruised
limbs
and
combed
my
tangled
hair
and
salved
my
limbs
with
unguents
pressed
by
hands
of
holy
ones
who
dream
beneath
the
suns
of
araby
the
blest
and
so
when
they
had
bathed
my
burning
eyes
with
milk
of
dreamy
anodyne
and
my
throat
with
wine
in
robings
of
cool
silk
my
broken
body
they
swathed
sandals
of
gold
they
placed
upon
my
feet
and
round
my
sad
brows
a
silver
fillet
bound
decking
me
with
the
pride
of
a
bridegroom
that
goes
to
the
joy
of
his
bride
and
is
lovely
in
her
eyes
and
led
me
to
her
side
then
as
a
conquering
prince
i
who
long
since
had
been
battered
and
tost
like
a
dead
leaf
or
ghost
buffeted
by
wild
storms
came
to
her
white
arms
conquering
and
was
lost
yet
dared
not
gaze
upon
the
beauty
that
i
dreamed
so
in
my
trance
it
seemed
that
a
shadowy
soft
dance
coiled
slowly
and
unwound
swayed
beckoned
and
recovered
as
hooded
cobra
bound
by
hollow
spells
of
sound
unto
the
piper
sways
so
silently
they
hovered
i
only
heard
the
beat
of
their
naked
feet
and
then
another
sound
a
dull
throb
thrumming
a
noise
of
faint
drumming
threatening
coming
nearer
piercing
deeper
than
a
dream
lost
in
the
heart
of
a
sleeper
into
those
deeps
where
the
dark
fire
gloweth
the
secret
flame
that
every
man
knoweth
embers
that
smoulder
fires
that
none
can
fan
terrible
older
than
the
mind
of
man
before
he
crawled
from
his
swamp
and
spurned
the
life
of
the
beast
that
dark
fire
burned
in
the
hidden
deeps
where
no
dream
can
come
only
the
throbbing
of
a
drum
can
wake
it
from
its
smouldering
sightless
soundless
senseless
dumb
dumb
as
those
blind
seeds
that
lie
in
mud
and
shuddering
i
knew
that
i
was
man
no
more
but
a
throbbing
core
of
flesh
that
knew
nor
beauty
nor
truth
nor
anything
but
the
black
sky
and
the
slimy
earth
roots
of
trees
and
fear
and
pain
the
blank
of
death
the
pangs
of
birth
an
inhuman
thing
by
the
throbbing
of
a
drum
and
my
lips
were
strange
and
numb
but
they
kissed
her
white
breast
then
being
drunk
with
pride
and
splendour
of
love
i
cried
o
spring
of
all
delight
o
moonèd
mystery
o
living
marvel
white
as
the
dead
queen
of
night
o
flower
and
o
flame
tell
me
at
least
thy
name
that
from
this
desolate
height
i
may
proclaim
its
wonder
to
the
lost
lands
hereunder
before
thy
beauty
dies
as
fades
the
fire
of
dawn
upon
a
peak
of
snow
then
look
she
sighed
into
my
eyes
and
thou
shalt
know
so
with
her
fingers
frail
she
pressed
my
brows
and
so
slowly
at
last
she
raised
my
drooping
eyelids
pale
and
in
her
eyes
i
gazed
fear
than
love
more
blind
caught
at
my
heart
and
fast
in
chains
of
horror
bound
as
one
who
in
profound
and
midnight
forest
ways
sees
in
the
dark
the
burning
eyes
of
a
tiger
barred
or
stealthy
footed
pard
blaze
in
a
solemn
hate
and
lust
of
human
blood
yet
can
not
cry
nor
turning
flee
from
the
huddled
wood
but
stands
and
sees
his
fate
or
one
who
in
a
black
night
groping
for
his
track
clings
to
the
dizzy
verge
of
a
cragged
precipice
shrinks
from
the
dim
abyss
yet
dare
not
venture
back
and
no
sound
hears
but
the
hiss
of
empty
air
swirling
past
his
ears
so
in
a
hideous
abandonment
of
hope
i
waited
for
her
kiss
then
the
restless
beat
of
the
muttering
drum
rose
to
a
frenzied
heat
the
naked
dancers
leapt
insolent
through
the
flame
laughing
as
they
came
with
parted
lips
their
cries
deadened
my
ears
my
eyes
throbbed
with
the
pattering
of
their
rapid
feet
and
the
whirling
dust
of
their
dancing
swept
into
my
throat
unslaked
with
drought
until
my
mouth
was
pressed
upon
her
burning
mouth
in
a
kiss
most
terrible
oh
was
it
pride
or
shame
unending
without
name
or
ecstasy
or
pain
or
desperate
desire
alas
i
can
not
tell
save
that
it
pierced
my
trembling
soul
and
body
with
fire
for
while
her
soft
lips
clove
to
mine
in
love
she
drove
a
flaming
blade
of
steel
into
my
breast
and
i
rent
with
a
bitter
cry
slid
from
her
side
and
fell
clutching
in
dumb
despair
the
dark
unbraided
hair
my
passion
had
despoiled
while
she
like
serpent
coiled
poised
for
another
stroke
terribly
slowly
smiled
saying
o
stranger
red
red
are
my
lips
and
sweet
unto
those
lips
so
red
are
the
kisses
of
the
dead
far
hast
thou
wandered
far
for
the
kisses
of
thamar
then
a
deep
silence
fell
on
the
frenzy
and
the
laughter
the
leaping
dancers
crept
to
the
shadows
where
they
had
slept
and
the
mute
eunuchs
stood
forth
and
hugely
bent
above
my
body
spent
in
its
pool
of
blood
and
hove
me
with
black
arms
while
the
queen
followed
after
with
stealthy
steps
and
eyes
that
burned
into
the
night
of
my
dying
brain
till
with
her
hand
she
bade
them
falter
and
they
stayed
while
eagerly
she
propped
my
listless
head
that
dropped
downward
from
my
shoulders
and
slowly
raised
it
up
raised
it
like
a
cup
unto
her
lips
again
then
shuddered
trembled
shrunk
as
though
her
mouth
had
drunk
a
potion
where
the
fell
fire
of
poison
smoulders
and
a
darkness
came
and
i
could
see
no
more
but
in
my
ears
the
roar
of
lonely
torrents
swelled
and
stilled
my
breath
for
ever
as
though
a
wave
appalling
had
broken
in
my
brain
and
deep
to
deep
were
calling
and
i
felt
my
body
falling
down
and
down
and
down
into
a
blank
of
death
where
dumb
waters
roll
endlessly
only
knowing
that
her
dagger
had
stabbed
my
breast
but
her
kiss
had
killed
my
soul
and
now
i
know
no
rest
until
again
i
stand
where
that
lost
towers
rise
from
the
dreamy
sand
until
i
reach
the
gate
where
the
lips
of
asia
wait
till
i
cross
the
drought
and
the
rivers
of
the
south
and
shiver
through
the
night
under
those
summits
white
that
soar
above
cathay
until
i
see
the
light
flame
from
those
tyrannous
glooms
where
like
a
tired
star
in
stormy
darkness
looms
the
castle
of
envoi
now
that
the
hour
has
come
and
under
the
lonely
darkness
i
stumble
at
the
doors
of
death
it
is
not
hope
nor
faith
that
here
my
spirit
sustaineth
but
love
only
in
visions
in
love
only
there
have
i
clutched
at
divinity
but
the
vision
fadeth
yet
love
fades
not
and
for
this
i
would
have
you
know
that
your
kiss
was
more
to
me
than
all
my
hopes
of
infinity
therein
you
made
me
divine
you
who
were
moon
and
sun
for
me
you
for
whose
beauty
i
would
have
forsaken
the
splendour
of
the
stars
and
my
shadowy
avatars
renounced
for
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
you
have
not
done
for
me
so
that
when
at
length
all
sentient
skill
hath
forsaken
me
and
the
bright
world
beats
vainly
on
my
consciousness
your
beauty
shineth
no
less
and
even
if
i
were
dead
i
think
your
shadow
would
awaken
me
