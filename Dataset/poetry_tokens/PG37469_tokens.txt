third
impression
preface
in
bringing
the
second
volume
of
imagist
before
the
public
the
authors
wish
to
express
their
gratitude
for
the
interest
which
the
volume
aroused
the
discussion
of
it
was
widespread
and
even
those
critics
out
of
sympathy
with
imagist
tenets
accorded
it
much
space
in
the
preface
to
that
book
we
endeavoured
to
present
those
tenets
in
a
succinct
form
but
the
very
brevity
we
employed
has
lead
to
a
great
deal
of
misunderstanding
we
have
decided
therefore
to
explain
the
laws
which
govern
us
a
little
more
fully
a
few
people
may
understand
and
the
rest
can
merely
misunderstand
again
a
result
to
which
we
are
quite
accustomed
in
the
first
place
does
not
mean
merely
the
presentation
of
pictures
refers
to
the
manner
of
presentation
not
to
the
subject
it
means
a
clear
presentation
of
whatever
the
author
wishes
to
convey
now
he
may
wish
to
convey
a
mood
of
indecision
in
which
case
the
poem
should
be
indecisive
he
may
wish
to
bring
before
his
reader
the
constantly
shifting
and
changing
lights
over
a
landscape
or
the
varying
attitudes
of
mind
of
a
person
under
strong
emotion
then
his
poem
must
shift
and
change
to
present
this
clearly
the
word
does
not
mean
the
word
which
exactly
describes
the
object
in
itself
it
means
the
word
which
brings
the
effect
of
that
object
before
the
reader
as
it
presented
itself
to
the
mind
at
the
time
of
writing
the
poem
imagists
deal
but
little
with
similes
although
much
of
their
poetry
is
metaphorical
the
reason
for
this
is
that
while
acknowledging
the
figure
to
be
an
integral
part
of
all
poetry
they
feel
that
the
constant
imposing
of
one
figure
upon
another
in
the
same
poem
blurs
the
central
effect
the
great
french
critic
remy
de
gourmont
wrote
last
summer
in
that
the
imagists
were
the
descendants
of
the
french
in
the
preface
to
his
des
de
gourmont
has
thus
described
in
literature
liberty
of
art
abandonment
of
existing
forms
the
sole
excuse
which
a
man
can
have
for
writing
is
to
write
down
himself
to
unveil
for
others
the
sort
of
world
which
mirrors
itself
in
his
individual
glass
he
should
create
his
own
aesthetics
and
we
should
admit
as
many
aesthetics
as
there
are
original
minds
and
judge
them
for
what
they
are
and
not
what
they
are
in
this
sense
the
imagists
are
descendants
of
the
they
are
individualists
the
only
reason
that
imagism
has
seemed
so
anarchaic
and
strange
to
english
and
american
reviewers
is
that
their
minds
do
not
easily
and
quickly
suggest
the
steps
by
which
modern
art
has
arrived
at
its
present
position
its
immediate
prototype
can
not
be
found
in
english
or
american
literature
we
must
turn
to
europe
for
it
with
debussy
and
stravinsky
in
music
and
gauguin
and
matisse
in
painting
it
should
have
been
evident
to
every
one
that
art
was
entering
upon
an
era
of
change
but
music
and
painting
are
universal
languages
so
we
have
become
accustomed
to
new
idioms
in
them
while
we
still
find
it
hard
to
recognize
a
changed
idiom
in
literature
the
crux
of
the
situation
is
just
here
it
is
in
the
idiom
employed
imagism
asks
to
be
judged
by
different
standards
from
those
employed
in
art
it
is
small
wonder
that
imagist
poetry
should
be
incomprehensible
to
men
whose
sole
touchstone
for
art
is
the
literature
of
one
country
for
a
period
of
four
centuries
and
it
is
an
illuminating
fact
that
among
poets
and
men
conversant
with
many
poetic
idioms
imagism
is
rarely
misconceived
they
may
not
agree
with
us
but
they
do
not
misunderstand
us
this
must
not
be
misconstrued
into
the
desire
to
belittle
our
forerunners
on
the
contrary
the
imagists
have
the
greatest
admiration
for
the
past
and
humility
towards
it
but
they
have
been
caught
in
the
throes
of
a
new
birth
the
exterior
world
is
changing
and
with
it
men
feelings
and
every
age
must
express
its
feelings
in
its
own
individual
way
no
art
is
any
more
than
another
all
art
is
an
attempt
to
express
the
feelings
of
the
artist
whether
it
be
couched
in
narrative
form
or
employ
a
more
personal
expression
it
is
not
what
imagists
write
about
which
makes
them
hard
of
comprehension
it
is
the
way
they
write
it
all
nations
have
laws
of
prosody
which
undergo
changes
from
time
to
time
the
laws
of
english
metrical
prosody
are
well
known
to
every
one
concerned
with
the
subject
but
that
is
only
one
form
of
prosody
other
nations
have
had
different
ones
poetry
was
founded
upon
alliteration
greek
and
roman
was
built
upon
quantity
the
oriental
was
formed
out
of
repetition
and
the
japanese
hokku
got
its
effects
by
an
exact
and
series
of
single
syllables
so
it
is
evident
that
poetry
can
be
written
in
many
modes
that
the
imagists
base
much
of
their
poetry
upon
cadence
and
not
upon
metre
makes
them
neither
good
nor
bad
and
no
one
realizes
more
than
they
that
no
theories
nor
rules
make
poetry
they
claim
for
their
work
only
that
it
is
sincere
it
is
this
very
fact
of
which
has
misled
so
many
reviewers
until
some
have
been
betrayed
into
saying
that
the
imagists
discard
rhythm
when
rhythm
is
the
most
important
quality
in
their
technique
the
definition
of
is
a
based
upon
cadence
now
cadence
in
music
is
one
thing
cadence
in
poetry
quite
another
since
we
are
not
dealing
with
tone
but
with
rhythm
it
is
the
sense
of
perfect
balance
of
flow
and
rhythm
not
only
must
the
syllables
so
fall
as
to
increase
and
continue
the
movement
but
the
whole
poem
must
be
as
rounded
and
recurring
as
the
circular
swing
of
a
balanced
pendulum
it
can
be
fast
or
slow
it
may
even
jerk
but
this
perfect
swing
it
must
have
even
its
jerks
must
follow
the
central
movement
to
illustrate
suppose
a
person
were
given
the
task
of
walking
or
running
round
a
large
circle
with
two
minutes
given
to
do
it
in
two
minutes
which
he
would
just
consume
if
he
walked
round
the
circle
quietly
but
in
order
to
make
the
task
easier
for
him
or
harder
as
the
case
might
be
he
was
required
to
complete
each
half
of
the
circle
in
exactly
a
minute
no
other
restrictions
were
placed
upon
him
he
might
dawdle
in
the
beginning
and
run
madly
to
reach
the
mark
on
time
and
then
complete
his
task
by
walking
steadily
round
the
second
half
to
goal
or
he
might
leap
and
run
and
skip
and
linger
in
all
sorts
of
ways
making
up
for
slow
going
by
fast
and
for
extra
haste
by
pauses
and
varying
these
movements
on
either
lap
of
the
circle
as
the
humour
seized
him
only
so
that
he
were
just
one
minute
in
traversing
the
first
and
just
one
minute
in
traversing
the
second
another
illustration
which
may
be
employed
is
that
of
a
japanese
where
a
toad
in
one
corner
is
balanced
by
a
spray
of
blown
flowers
in
the
opposite
upper
one
the
flowers
are
not
the
same
shape
as
the
toad
neither
are
they
the
same
size
but
the
balance
is
preserved
the
unit
in
is
not
the
foot
the
number
of
the
syllables
the
quantity
or
the
line
the
unit
is
the
strophe
which
may
be
the
whole
poem
or
may
be
only
a
part
each
strophe
is
a
complete
circle
in
fact
the
meaning
of
the
greek
word
is
simply
that
part
of
the
poem
which
was
recited
while
the
chorus
were
making
a
turn
round
the
altar
set
up
in
the
centre
of
the
theatre
the
simile
of
the
circle
is
more
than
a
simile
therefore
it
is
a
fact
of
course
the
circle
need
not
always
be
the
same
size
nor
need
the
times
allowed
to
negotiate
it
be
always
the
same
there
is
room
here
for
an
infinite
number
of
variations
also
circles
can
be
added
to
circles
movement
upon
movement
to
the
poem
provided
each
movement
completes
itself
and
ramifies
naturally
into
the
next
but
one
thing
must
be
borne
in
mind
a
cadenced
poem
is
written
to
be
read
aloud
in
this
way
only
will
its
rhythm
be
felt
poetry
is
a
spoken
and
not
a
written
art
the
are
often
accused
of
declaring
that
they
have
discovered
a
new
thing
where
such
an
idea
started
it
is
impossible
to
say
certainly
none
of
the
better
was
ever
guilty
of
so
ridiculous
a
statement
the
name
is
new
the
thing
most
emphatically
is
not
not
new
in
english
poetry
at
any
rate
you
will
find
something
very
much
like
it
in
a
great
deal
of
milton
is
written
in
it
and
matthew
arnold
is
a
shining
example
of
it
practically
all
of
henley
are
written
in
it
and
so
potent
are
names
until
it
was
christened
no
one
thought
of
objecting
to
it
but
the
oldest
reference
to
is
to
be
found
in
chaucer
of
where
the
eagle
addresses
the
poet
in
these
words
and
nevertheless
hast
set
thy
wyt
although
that
in
thy
heed
full
lyte
is
to
make
bookes
songes
or
dytees
in
rhyme
or
elles
in
cadence
commentators
have
wasted
reams
of
paper
in
an
endeavour
to
determine
what
chaucer
meant
by
this
but
is
it
not
possible
that
he
meant
a
verse
based
upon
rhythm
but
which
did
not
follow
the
strict
metrical
prosody
of
his
usual
practice
one
of
the
charges
frequently
brought
against
the
imagists
is
that
they
write
not
poetry
but
this
misconception
springs
from
the
almost
complete
ignorance
of
the
public
in
regard
to
the
laws
of
cadenced
verse
but
in
fact
what
is
prose
and
what
is
poetry
is
it
merely
a
matter
of
typographical
arrangement
must
everything
which
is
printed
in
equal
lines
with
rhymes
at
the
ends
be
called
poetry
and
everything
which
is
printed
in
a
block
be
called
prose
aristotle
who
certainly
knew
more
about
this
subject
than
any
one
else
declares
in
his
that
prose
is
rhythmical
without
being
metrical
that
is
to
say
without
insistence
on
any
single
rhythm
and
then
goes
on
to
state
the
feet
that
are
employed
in
prose
making
incidentally
the
remark
that
the
iambic
prevailed
in
ordinary
conversation
the
fact
is
that
there
is
no
hard
and
fast
dividing
line
between
prose
and
poetry
as
a
french
poet
of
distinction
paul
fort
has
said
and
poetry
are
but
one
instrument
it
is
not
a
question
of
typography
it
is
not
even
a
question
of
rules
and
forms
poetry
is
the
vision
in
a
man
soul
which
he
translates
as
best
he
can
with
the
means
at
his
disposal
we
are
young
we
are
experimentalists
but
we
ask
to
be
judged
by
our
own
standards
not
by
those
which
have
governed
other
men

other

it

and
puffing
steam
and
smoke

to
the

sooty

there
stands
an
old

a
statue
of

a
little
nearer
camden
town
in
a
square
of
ugly
sordid
shops
is
another
statue
facing
the

staring
with
a
heavy
purposeless
glare
at
the
red
and
white
shining
tiles
a
tall
stone
statue
of
cobden
and
though
no
one
ever
pauses
to
see
what
hero
it
is
that
faces
the

i
can
understand
very
well
indeed
that
england
must
honour
its
national
heroes
must
honour
the
hero
of
free
trade
or
was
it
the
corn
laws
that
i
can
understand
but
what
i
shall
never
understand
is
the
little
group
in
the
dingy
yard
under
the
dingier
sky
the
eros
and
psyche
surrounded
with
pots
and
busts
and
urns
and
broken
pillars
eros
naked
with
his
wings
stretched
out
just
lighting
down
to
kiss
her
on
the
lips
what
are
they
doing
here
in
camden
town
in
the
midst
of
all
this
clamour
and
filth
they
who
should
stand
in
a
room
hung
with
deep
purple
painted
with
gods
paved
with
white
porphyry
stand
for
ever
embraced
by
the
side
of
a
rustling
fountain
over
a
marble
basin
carved
with
leopards
and
grapes
and
young
men
dancing
or
in
a
garden
leaning
above
corinth
under
the
ilices
and
the
cypresses
very
white
against
a
very
blue
sky
or
growing
hoary
if
they
must
grow
old
with
lichens
and
softly
creeping
moss
what
are
they
doing
here
in
camden
town
and
who
has
brought
their
naked
beauty
and
their
young
fresh
lust
to
camden
town
which
settled
long
ago
to
toil
and
sweat
and
filth
forgetting
to
the
greater
glory
of
free
trade
young
beauty
and
young
love
and
youthful
flesh
slowly
the
rain
settles
down
on
them
slowly
the
soot
eats
into
them
slowly
the
stone
grows
greyer
and
dirtier
till
in
spite
of
his
spreading
wings
her
eyes
have
a
rim
of
soot
half
an
inch
deep
and
his
wings
the
tall
god
wings
that
should
be
red
and
silver
are
ocherous
brown
and
i
peer
from
a
as
we
splash
through
the
grease
and
puddles
and
i
glimpse
them
huddled
against
the
wall
under
a
smoke
and
i
see
the
limbs
that
a
greek
slave
cut
in
some
old
italian
town
i
see
them
growing
older
and
sadder
and
greyer
after
two
years
she
is
all
so
slight
and
tender
and
white
as
a
may
morning
she
walks
without
hood
at
dusk
it
is
good
to
hear
her
sing
it
is
god
will
that
i
shall
love
her
still
as
he
loves
mary
and
night
and
day
i
will
go
forth
to
pray
that
she
love
me
she
is
as
gold
lovely
and
far
more
cold
do
thou
pray
with
me
for
if
i
win
grace
to
kiss

by

of

the

this

is
not

omnibuses
with
red
taxicabs
with
shiny

rumble
shunning
its
ugliness
it
is
corrugated
with
it
is
dented
and
pockmarked
with
traffic
it
has
no
time
for
sleep
it
heaves
its
old
scarred
countenance
skyward
between
the
buildings
and
never
says
a
word
on
rainy
nights
it
dully
gleams
like
the
cold
tarnished
scales
of
a
snake
and
over
it
hang
on
black
stems
in
the
theatre
darkness
in
the
theatre
darkness
and
a
multitude
assembled
in
the
darkness
these
who
every
day
perform
the
unique
of
birth
and
death
now
press
upon
each
other
directing
the
irresistible
weight
of
their
thoughts
to
the
stage
a
great
broad
shaft
of
calcium
light
cleaves
like
a
stroke
of
a
sword
the
darkness
and
at
the
end
of
it
a
tiny
spot
which
is
the
red
nose
of
a
comedian
marks
the
goal
of
the
and
the
eyes
which
people
the

ships
in

like
a

of

blue
cranes
resting
upon

the

assemble
at

when
the
grey
light
wakes
in
the
east
weary
no
longer
flying
over
the
hissing
spindrift
through
the
ravelled
clutching
sea
no
longer
over
the
tops
of
the
waves
spinning
along
in
a
great
irregular
wedge
before
the
far
from
land
but
drowsy
mournful
silent
yet
under
their
bulged
projecting
bows
runs
the
silver
foam
of
the
sunlight
and
rebelliously
they
shake
out
their
plumage
of
sails
wet
and
heavy
with
the
rain
the
empty
house
out
from
my
i
lean
and
see
a
straight
row
of
houses
once
long
ago
these
had
their
glory
they
were
built
in
the
fair
palmy
days
before
the
civil
war
when
all
the
seas
saw
the
white
sails
of
yankee
ships
scurrying
home
with
spice
and
gold
and
many
of
these
houses
hung
proud
wisps
of
crêpe
upon
their
doors
on
hearing
that
some
son
had
died
at
chancellorsville
or
fredericksburg
their
offering
to
the
union
side
but
man
forever
drifting
will
again
took
hold
of
him
again
the
fashionable
quarter
shifted
soon
before
some
plastering
had
dried
society
packed
up
went
away
now
could
you
see
these
houses
you
would
not
think
they
ever
had
a
prime
a
grim
serried
row
of
rooms
to
let
at
any
time
tenants
are
moving
in
or
out
families
drifting
down
or
struggling
still
to
keep
their
heads
up
and
not
drown
a
tragic
busy
pettiness
has
settled
on
them
all
but
one
and
in
that
one
when
i
came
here
a
family
lived
but
with
its
trunks
packed
up
and
now
that
family
gone
its
shutterless
blindless
windows
let
you
look
inside
and
see
the
sunlight
chequering
the
bare
floor
with
patterns
from
the
all
day
its
backyard
neatly
swept
contains
no
crammed
and
no
lines
for
clothes
to
flap
about
on
it
does
not
look
by
day
as
if
it
had
ever
a
living
soul
beneath
its
roof
it
seems
to
mark
a
gap
in
the
grim
line
no
house
at
all
but
an
unfinished
shell
but
when
the
windows
up
and
down
those
faces
with
yellow
glimmer
of
gas
blaze
forth
i
know
it
is
the
only
house
that
lives
in
all
that
grim
row
the
others
are
mere
shelves
overcrowded
layers
of
warring
separate
personalities
a
jangle
and
a
tangle
of
emotions
without
a
single
meaning
running
through
them
but
it
the
empty
house
has
mastered
all
its
secrets
behind
its
silent
swarthy
face
eyelessly
proud
it
watches
it
is
master
it
sees
the
other
houses
still
incessantly
learning
the
lesson
it
remembers
and
which
it
can
repeat
the
last
dim
syllable
of
the
skaters
black
swallows
swooping
or
gliding
in
a
flurry
of
entangled
loops
and
curves
the
skaters
skim
over
the
frozen
river
and
the
grinding
click
of
their
skates
as
they
impinge
upon
the
surface
is
like
the
brushing
together
of
thin
of
silver
flint
easter
friend
we
will
take
the
path
that
leads
down
from
the
flagstaff
by
the
pond
through
the
gorse
thickets
see
the
golden
spikes
have
thrust
their
points
through
and
last
year
bracken
lies
and
trampled
the
sapling
have
shown
no
leaf
and
the
wistarias
on
the
desolate
pergola
are
shorn
and
ashen
we
lurch
on
and
stumbling
touch
each
other
you
do
not
shrink
friend
there
you
and
i
here
side
by
side
we
go
jesting
we
do
not
seek
we
do
not
avoid
contact
here
is
the
road
with
the
budding
lining
it
and
there
the
low
gate
in
the
wall
on
the
other
side
the
people
are
they
not
aliens
you
and
i
for
a
moment
see
them
shabby
of
limb
and
soul
patched
up
to
make
shift
we
laugh
and
strengthen
each
other
but
the
evil
is
done
is
not
the
whole
park
made
for
them
and
the
bushes
and
plants
and
trees
and
grasses
have
they
not
grown
to
their
standard
the
paths
are
worn
to
the
gravel
with
their
feet
the
green
moss
will
not
carpet
them
the
flags
of
the
stone
steps
are
hollowed
and
you
and
i
must
strive
to
remain
two
and
not
to
merge
in
the
multitude
it
impinges
on
us
it
separates
us
we
shrink
from
it
we
brave
through
it
we
laugh
we
jest
we
jeer
and
we
save
the
fragments
of
our
souls
between
two
clipped
privet
hedges
now
we
will
close
our
eyes
for
life
sake
to
life
patches
here
maybe
there
is
quiet
pass
first
under
the
bare
branches
beyond
is
a
pool
flanked
with
sedge
and
a
swan
among
but
here
too
is
a
group
of
men
and
women
and
children
and
the
swan
has
forgotten
its
pride
it
thrusts
its
white
neck
among
them
and
gobbles
at
nothing
then
tires
of
the
cheat
and
sails
off
but
its
breast
urges
before
it
a
sheet
of
sodden
newspaper
that
drifting
away
reveals
beneath
the
immaculate
white
splendour
of
its
neck
and
wings
a
breast
black
with
scum
friend
we
are
beaten
ogre
through
the
open
window
can
be
seen
the
poplars
at
the
end
of
the
garden
shaking
in
the
wind
a
wall
of
green
leaves
so
high
that
the
sky
is
shut
off
on
the
white
a
rose
in
a
vase
centre
of
a
sphere
of
odour
contemplates
the
crumbs
and
crusts
left
from
a
meal
cups
saucers
plates
lie
here
and
there
and
a
sparrow
flies
by
the
open
window
stops
for
a
moment
flutters
his
wings
rapidly
and
climbs
an
aerial
ladder
with
his
claws
that
work
close
in
to
his
soft
belly
but
behind
the
table
is
the
face
of
a
man
the
bird
flies
off
cones
the
blue
mist
of
fills
all
the
trees
the
sunlight
gilds
the
tops
of
the
poplar
spires
far
off
behind
the
houses
here
a
branch
sways
and
there
a
sparrow
twitters
the
curtain
hem
flutters
and
half
reveals
a
chimney
pot
the
quiet
in
the
room
bears
patiently
a
footfall
on
the
street
gloom
i
sat
there
in
the
dark
of
the
room
and
of
my
mind
thinking
of
men
treasons
and
bad
faith
sinking
into
the
pit
of
my
own
weakness
before
their
strength
of
cunning
out
over
the
gardens
came
the
sound
of
some
one
playing
exercises
on
the
piano
then
i
gathered
up
within
me
all
my
powers
until
outside
of
me
was
nothing
i
was
all
all
stubborn
fighting
sadness
and
revulsion
and
one
came
from
the
garden
quietly
and
stood
beside
me
she
laid
her
hand
on
my
hair
she
laid
her
cheek
on
my
forehead
and
caressed
me
with
it
but
all
my
being
rose
to
my
forehead
to
fight
against
this
outside
thing
something
in
me
became
angry
withstood
like
a
wall
and
would
allow
no
entrance
i
hated
her
is
the
matter
with
you
dear
she
said
i
answered
am
she
stroked
my
hair
and
went
away
and
i
was
still
gloomy
angry
stubborn
then
i
thought
she
has
gone
away
she
is
hurt
she
does
not
know
what
poison
has
been
working
in
me
then
i
thought
upstairs
her
child
is
sleeping
and
i
felt
the
presence
of
the
fields
we
had
walked
over
the
roads
we
had
followed
the
flowers
we
had
watched
together
before
it
came
she
had
touched
my
hair
and
only
then
did
i
feel
it
and
i
loved
her
once
again
and
i
came
away
full
of
the
sweet
and
bitter
juices
of
life
and
i
lit
the
lamp
in
my
room
and
made
this
poem
terror
eyes
are
tired
the
lamp
burns
and
in
its
circle
of
light
papers
and
books
lie
where
chance
and
life
have
placed
them
silence
sings
all
around
me
my
head
is
bound
with
a
band
outside
in
the
street
a
few
footsteps
a
clock
strikes
the
hour
i
gaze
and
my
eyes
close
slowly
i
doze
but
the
moment
before
sleep
a
voice
calls
my
name
in
my
ear
and
the
shock
jolts
my
heart
but
when
i
open
my
eyes
and
look
first
left
and
then
right
no
one
is
there
chalfont
saint
giles
the
low
graves
are
all
grown
over
with
and
a
grass
links
each
with
each
old
family
vaults
some
within
railings
stand
here
and
there
crumbling
with
the
ivy
growing
up
them
and
diagonally
across
the
top
projecting
slab
and
over
the
vaults
lean
the
great
lilac
bushes
with
their
leaves
and
their
purple
and
white
blossom
a
wall
of
ivy
shuts
off
the
darkness
of
the
and
the
larches
walk
quietly
along
the
mossy
paths
the
stones
of
the
humble
dead
are
hidden
behind
the
blue
mantle
of
their
and
before
one
grave
so
hidden
a
widow
kneels
with
head
bowed
and
the
crape
falling
over
her
shoulders
the
bells
for
evening
church
are
ringing
and
the
people
come
gravely
and
with
red
faces
through
the
gates
in
the
wall
pass
on
this
is
the
and
within
the
men
of
the
village
in
their
sunday
clothes
pull
their
on
the
red
and
white
grip
of
the
that
fly
up
and
then
fall
snakily
they
stand
there
given
wholly
to
the
rhythm
and
swing
of
their
traditional
movements
and
the
people
pass
between
them
into
the
church
but
we
are
too
sad
and
too
reverent
to
enter
if
i
go
out
of
the
door
it
will
not
be
to
take
the
road
to
the
left
that
leads
past
the
bovine
quiet
of
houses
brooding
over
the
cud
of
their
daily
content
even
though
the
tranquillity
of
their
gardens
is
a
lure
that
once
was
stronger
even
though
from
privet
hedge
and
mottled
laurel
the
young
green
peeps
and
the
daffodils
and
the
yellow
and
white
and
purple
crocuses
laugh
from
the
smooth
mould
of
the
garden
beds
to
the
upright
golden
buds
of
the
chestnut
trees
i
shall
not
see
the
almond
blossom
shaming
the
boughs
but
to
the
right
the
road
will
lead
me
to
greater
and
greater
disquiet
into
the
swift
rattling
noise
of
the
and
the
dust
the
tattered
paper
the
detritus
of
a
city
that
swirls
in
the
air
behind
them
i
will
pass
the
shops
where
the
prices
are
judged
day
by
day
by
the
people
and
come
to
the
place
where
five
roads
meet
with
five
and
where
amid
the
din
of
the
vans
the
lorries
the
the
clangorous
the
news
is
shouted
and
soldiers
gather
here
i
can
feel
the
heat
of
europe
fever
and
i
can
make
as
each
man
makes
the
beauty
of
the
woman
he
loves
no
spring
and
no
woman
beauty
while
that
is
burning
lawrence
erinnyes
there
has
been
so
much
noise
bleeding
and
shouting
and
dying
clamour
of
death
there
are
so
many
dead
many
have
died
unconsenting
their
ghosts
are
angry
unappeased
so
many
ghosts
among
us
invisible
yet
strong
between
me
and
thee
so
many
ghosts
of
the
slain
they
come
back
over
the
white
sea
in
the
mist
invisible
trooping
home
the
unassuaged
ghosts
endlessly
returning
on
the
uneasy
sea
they
set
foot
on
this
land
to
which
they
have
the
right
they
return
relentlessly
in
the
silence
one
knows
their
tread
multitudinous
endless
the
ghosts
coming
home
again
they
watch
us
they
press
on
us
they
press
their
claim
upon
us
they
are
angry
with
us
what
do
they
want
we
are
driven
mad
madly
we
rush
hither
and
thither
shouting
revenge
crying
out
the
blood
of
the
foe
seeking
to
appease
with
blood
the
insistent
ghosts
out
of
blood
rise
up
new
ghosts
grey
stern
angry
unsatisfied
the
more
we
slay
and
are
slain
the
more
we
raise
up
new
ghosts
against
us
till
we
are
mad
with
terror
seeing
the
slain
victorious
grey
grisly
ghosts
in
our
streets
grey
unappeased
ghosts
seated
in
the
the
dead
triumphant
and
the
quick
cast
down
the
dead
unassuaged
and
angry
silencing
us
making
us
pale
and
bloodless
without
resistance
what
do
they
want
the
ghosts
what
is
it
they
demand
as
they
stand
in
menace
over
against
us
how
shall
we
now
appease
whom
we
have
raised
up
since
from
blood
poured
out
rise
only
ghosts
again
what
shall
we
do
what
shall
we
give
to
them
what
do
they
want
forever
there
on
our
threshold
must
we
open
the
doors
and
admit
them
receive
them
home
and
in
the
silence
reverently
welcome
them
and
give
them
place
and
honour
and
service
meet
for
one
year
space
attend
on
our
angry
dead
soothe
them
with
service
and
honour
and
silence
meet
strengthen
prepare
them
for
the
journey
hence
then
lead
them
to
the
gates
of
the
unknown
and
bid
farewell
oh
stately
travellers
and
wait
till
they
are
lost
upon
our
sight
then
we
shall
turn
us
home
again
to
life
knowing
our
dead
are
fitly
housed
in
death
not
roaming
here
disconsolate
angrily
and
we
shall
have
new
peace
in
this
our
life
new
joy
to
give
more
life
new
bliss
to
live
sure
of
our
dead
in
the
proud
halls
of
death
perfidy
hollow
rang
the
house
when
i
knocked
at
the
door
and
i
lingered
on
the
threshold
with
my
hand
upraised
to
knock
and
knock
once
more
listening
for
the
sound
of
her
feet
across
the
floor
hollow
my
heart
the
lamps
stretched
down
the
road
with
shadows
drifting
underneath
with
a
music
of
soft
melodious
feet
quickening
my
hope
as
i
hastened
to
meet
the
light
of
her
eyes
the
golden
lamps
down
the
street
went
out
the
last
car
trailed
the
night
behind
and
i
in
the
darkness
wandered
about
with
a
flutter
of
hope
and
of
doubt
in
the
dying
lamp
of
my
love
two
brown
ponies
trotting
slowly
stopped
at
the
trough
to
drink
the
dark
van
drummed
down
the
distance
slowly
and
city
stars
so
high
and
holy
drew
nearer
to
look
in
the
streets
a
hasting
car
swept
shameful
past
i
saw
her
hid
in
the
shadow
i
saw
her
step
to
the
curb
and
fast
run
to
the
silent
door
where
last
i
had
stood
with
my
hand
uplifted
she
clung
to
the
door
in
her
haste
to
enter
entered
and
quickly
cast
it
shut
behind
her
leaving
the
street
aghast
at
the
window
the
pine
trees
bend
to
listen
to
the
autumn
wind
as
it
mutters
something
which
sets
the
black
poplars
ashake
with
hysterical
laughter
while
slowly
the
house
of
day
is
closing
its
eastern
shutters
further
down
the
valley
the
clustered
tombstones
recede
winding
about
their
dimness
the
mists
grey
cerements
after
the
in
the
twilight
have
suddenly
started
to
bleed
the
leaves
fly
over
the
window
and
whisper
a
word
as
they
pass
to
the
face
that
leans
from
the
darkness
intent
with
two
eyes
of
darkness
that
watch
forever
earnestly
from
behind
the
window
glass
in
trouble
and
shame
i
look
at
the
swaling
sunset
and
wish
i
could
go
also
through
the
red
doors
beyond
the
bar
i
wish
that
i
could
go
through
the
red
doors
where
i
could
put
off
my
shame
like
shoes
in
the
porch
my
pain
like
garments
and
leave
my
flesh
discarded
lying
like
luggage
of
some
departed
traveller
gone
one
knows
not
where
then
i
would
turn
round
and
seeing
my
body
lying
like
lumber
i
would
laugh
with
joy
brooding
grief
a
yellow
leaf
from
the
darkness
hops
like
a
frog
before
me
why
should
i
start
and
stand
still
i
was
watching
the
woman
that
bore
me
stretched
in
the
brindled
darkness
of
the
rigid
with
will
to
die
and
the
quick
leaf
tore
me
back
to
this
rainy
swill
of
leaves
and
lamps
and
traffic
mingled
before
me
amy
lowell
patterns
i
walk
down
the
garden
paths
and
all
the
daffodils
are
blowing
and
the
bright
blue
squills
i
walk
down
the
patterned
garden
paths
in
my
stiff
brocaded
gown
with
my
powdered
hair
and
jewelled
fan
i
too
am
a
rare
pattern
as
i
wander
down
the
garden
paths
my
dress
is
richly
figured
and
the
train
makes
a
pink
and
silver
stain
on
the
gravel
and
the
thrift
of
the
borders
just
a
plate
of
current
fashion
tripping
by
in
ribboned
shoes
not
a
softness
anywhere
about
me
only
and
brocade
and
i
sink
on
a
seat
in
the
shade
of
a
lime
tree
for
my
passion
wars
against
the
stiff
brocade
the
daffodils
and
squills
flutter
in
the
breeze
as
they
please
and
i
weep
for
the
lime
tree
is
in
blossom
and
one
small
flower
has
dropped
upon
my
bosom
and
the
plashing
of
waterdrops
in
the
marble
fountain
comes
down
the
garden
paths
the
dripping
never
stops
underneath
my
stiffened
gown
is
the
softness
of
a
woman
bathing
in
a
marble
basin
a
basin
in
the
midst
of
hedges
grown
so
thick
she
can
not
see
her
lover
hiding
but
she
guesses
he
is
near
and
the
sliding
of
the
water
seems
the
stroking
of
a
dear
hand
upon
her
what
is
summer
in
a
fine
brocaded
gown
i
should
like
to
see
it
lying
in
a
heap
upon
the
ground
all
the
pink
and
silver
crumpled
up
on
the
ground
i
would
be
the
pink
and
silver
as
i
ran
along
the
paths
and
he
would
stumble
after
bewildered
by
my
laughter
i
should
see
the
sun
flashing
from
his
sword
hilt
and
the
buckles
on
his
shoes
i
would
choose
to
lead
him
in
a
maze
along
the
patterned
paths
a
bright
and
laughing
maze
for
my
lover
till
he
caught
me
in
the
shade
and
the
buttons
of
his
waistcoat
bruised
my
body
as
he
clasped
me
aching
melting
unafraid
with
the
shadows
of
the
leaves
and
the
sundrops
and
the
plopping
of
the
waterdrops
all
about
us
in
the
open
afternoon
i
am
very
like
to
swoon
with
the
weight
of
this
brocade
for
the
sun
sifts
through
the
shade
underneath
the
fallen
blossom
in
my
bosom
is
a
letter
i
have
hid

was
brought
to
me
this
morning
by
a
rider
from
the
duke
we
regret
to
inform
you
that

in
action
thursday
as
i
read

white
morning

letters
squirmed
like
snakes
answer

said
my
footman
i
told
him
that
the
messenger
takes
some
refreshment

and
i
walked
into
the
garden
up
and
down
the
patterned
paths
in
my
stiff
correct
brocade
the
blue
and
yellow
flowers
stood
up
proudly
in
the
sun
each
one
i
stood
upright
too
held
rigid
to
the
pattern
by
the
stiffness
of
my
gown
up
and
down
i
walked
up
and
down
in
a
month
he
would
have
been
my
husband
in
a
month
here
underneath
this
lime
we
would
have
broke
the
pattern
he
for
me
and
i
for
him
he
as
colonel
i
as
lady
on
this
shady
seat

had
a
whim

sunlight
carried
blessing
and
i
answered

as
you
have
now

is
dead
in
summer
and

shall
walk
up
and
down
the
patterned
garden
paths
in
my
stiff
brocaded
gown

squills
and
daffodils
will
give
place
to
pillared
roses
and
to
asters
and
to
snow
i
shall
go
up
and
down
in
my
gown
gorgeously
arrayed
boned
and
stayed
and
the
softness
of
my
body
will
be
guarded
from
embrace
by
each
button
hook
and
lace
for
the
man
who
should
loose

dead
fighting
with
the
duke
in
flanders
in
a
pattern
called
a

patterns
for
spring
day
bath
the
day
is
and
fair
and
there
is
a
smell
of
tulips
and
narcissus
in
the
air
the
sunshine
pours
in
at
the
window
and
bores
through
the
water
in
the
in
lathes
and
planes
of
greenish
white
it
cleaves
the
water
into
flaws
like
a
jewel
and
cracks
it
to
bright
light
little
spots
of
sunshine
lie
on
the
surface
of
the
water
and
dance
dance
and
their
reflections
wobble
deliciously
over
the
ceiling
a
stir
of
my
finger
sets
them
whirring
reeling
i
move
a
foot
and
the
planes
of
light
in
the
water
jar
i
lie
back
and
laugh
and
let
the
water
the
beryl
water
flow
over
me
the
day
is
almost
too
bright
to
bear
the
green
water
covers
me
from
the
too
bright
day
i
will
lie
here
awhile
and
play
with
the
water
and
the
sun
spots
the
sky
is
blue
and
high
a
crow
flaps
by
the
window
and
there
is
a
whirl
of
tulips
and
narcissus
in
the
air
breakfast
table
in
the
sunlight
the
breakfast
table
is
decked
and
white
it
offers
itself
in
flat
surrender
tendering
tastes
and
smells
and
colours
and
metals
and
grains
and
the
white
cloth
falls
over
its
side
draped
and
wide
wheels
of
white
glitter
in
the
silver
coffee
pot
hot
and
spinning
like
they
whirl
and
twirl
and
my
eyes
begin
to
smart
the
little
white
dazzling
wheels
prick
them
like
darts
placid
and
peaceful
the
rolls
of
bread
spread
themselves
in
the
sun
to
bask
a
stack
of
pyramidal
shout

through
the
white
scream

yellow
coffee

rises
in
a
stream

the

with

and
twists
up
into
the
sunlight
revolved
involuted
suspiring
higher
and
higher
fluting
in
a
thin
spiral
up
the
high
blue
sky
a
crow
flies
by
and
croaks
at
the
coffee
steam
the
day
is
new
and
fair
with
good
smells
in
the
air
walk
over
the
street
the
white
clouds
meet
and
sheer
away
without
touching
on
the
sidewalk
boys
are
playing
marbles
glass
marbles
with
amber
and
blue
hearts
roll
together
and
part
with
a
sweet
clashing
noise
the
boys
strike
them
with
black
and
red
striped
agates
the
glass
marbles
spit
crimson
when
they
are
hit
and
slip
into
the
gutters
under
rushing
brown
water
i
smell
tulips
and
narcissus
in
the
air
but
there
are
no
flowers
anywhere
only
white
dust
whipping
up
the
street
and
a
girl
with
a
gay
spring
hat
and
blowing
skirts
the
dust
and
the
wind
flirt
at
her
ankles
and
her
neat
patent
leather
shoes
tap
tap
the
little
heels
pat
the
pavement
and
the
wind
rustles
among
the
flowers
on
her
hat
a
crawls
slowly
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
it
is
green
and
gay
with
new
paint
and
rumbles
contentedly
sprinkling
clear
water
over
the
white
dust
clear
water
which
smells
of
tulips
and
narcissus
the
thickening
branches
make
a
pink
against
the
blue
sky
whoop
the
clouds
go
dashing
at
each
other
and
sheer
away
just
in
time
whoop
and
a
man
hat
careers
down
the
street
in
front
of
the
white
dust
leaps
into
the
branches
of
a
tree
veers
away
and
trundles
ahead
of
the
wind
jarring
the
sunlight
into
spokes
of
and
green
a
motor
car
cuts
a
swath
through
the
bright
air
irresistible
shouting
to
the
wind
to
make
way
a
glare
of
dust
and
sunshine
tosses
together
behind
it
and
settles
down
the
sky
is
quiet
and
high
and
the
morning
is
fair
with
air
midday
and
afternoon
swirl
of
crowded
streets
shock
and
recoil
of
traffic
the
brick
façade
of
an
old
church
against
which
the
waves
of
people
lurch
and
withdraw
flare
of
sunshine
down
eddies
of
light
in
the
windows
of
chemists
shops
with
their
blue
gold
purple
jars
darting
colours
far
into
the
crowd
loud
bangs
and
tremors
murmurings
out
of
high
windows
whirling
of
machine
belts
blurring
of
horses
and
motors
a
quick
spin
and
shudder
of
brakes
on
an
electric
car
and
the
jar
of
a
church
bell
knocking
against
the
metal
blue
of
the
sky
i
am
a
piece
of
the
town
a
bit
of
blown
dust
thrust
along
with
the
crowd
proud
to
feel
the
pavement
under
me
reeling
with
feet
feet
tripping
skipping
lagging
dragging
plodding
doggedly
or
springing
up
and
advancing
on
firm
elastic
insteps
a
boy
is
selling
papers
i
smell
them
clean
and
new
from
the
press
they
are
fresh
like
the
air
and
pungent
as
tulips
and
narcissus
the
blue
sky
pales
to
lemon
and
great
tongues
of
gold
blind
the
putting
out
their
contents
in
a
flood
of
flame
night
and
sleep
the
day
takes
her
ease
in
slippered
yellow
electric
signs
gleam
out
along
the
shop
fronts
following
each
other
they
grow
and
grow
and
blow
into
patterns
of
as
the
sky
fades
trades
scream
in
spots
of
light
at
the
unruffled
night
twinkle
jab
snap
that
means
a
new
play
and
over
the
way
plop
drop
quiver
is
the
sidelong
sliver
of
a
sign
with
its
length
on
another
street
a
gigantic
mug
of
beer
effervesces
to
the
atmosphere
over
a
tall
building
but
the
sky
is
high
and
has
her
own
stars
why
should
she
heed
ours
i
leave
the
city
with
speed
wheels
whirl
to
take
me
back
to
my
trees
and
my
quietness
the
breeze
which
blows
with
me
is
and
clean
it
has
come
but
recently
from
the
high
sky
there
are
no
flowers
in
bloom
yet
but
the
earth
of
my
garden
smells
of
tulips
and
narcissus
my
room
is
tranquil
and
friendly
out
of
the
window
i
can
see
the
distant
city
a
band
of
twinkling
gems
little
flower
heads
with
no
stems
i
can
not
see
the
beer
glass
nor
the
letters
of
the
restaurants
and
shops
i
passed
now
the
signs
blur
and
all
together
make
the
city
glowing
on
a
night
of
fine
weather
like
a
garden
stirring
and
blowing
for
the
spring
the
night
is
and
fair
and
there
is
a
whiff
of
flowers
in
the
air
wrap
me
close
sheets
of
lavender
pour
your
blue
and
purple
dreams
into
my
ears
the
breeze
whispers
at
the
shutters
and
mutters
queer
tales
of
old
days
and
cobbled
streets
and
youths
leaping
their
horses
down
marble
stairways
pale
blue
lavender
you
are
the
colour
of
the
sky
when
it
is
and
fair
i
smell
the
stars
they
are
like
tulips
and
narcissus
i
smell
them
in
the

stravinsky
three
pieces
for
string
quartet
this
quartet
was
played
from
the
manuscript
by
the
flonzaley
quartet
during
their
season
of
and
the
poem
is
based
upon
the
programme
which
stravinsky
appended
to
his
piece
and
is
an
attempt
to
reproduce
the
sound
and
movement
of
the
music
as
far
as
is
possible
in
another
medium
first

drums

banging

wooden

beating
the

of
the

slapping
the

stones
and
a
shaking
and
cracking
of

bones
clumsy
and
hard
they
are
and
uneven
losing
half
a

because
the

are

the

with

movement
an
organ
growls
in
the
heavy
of
a
church
it
wheezes
and
coughs
the
nave
is
blue
with
incense
writhing
twisting
snaking
over
the
heads
of

the

walk
endlessly
round
and
round
droning
their
latin
off

the
organ
crashes
out
in
a
flaring
chord
and
the
priests
hitch
their
chant
up
half
a

there
is
a

stillness
in

upon
