this
is
the

pyre
and
troy
is
dead
that
sparkled
so
the
day
i
saw
it
first
and
darkened
slowly
after
i
am
she
who
loves
all
beauty
yet
i
wither
it
why
have
the
high
gods
made
me
wreak
their
wrath
forever
since
my
maidenhood
to
sow
sorrow
and
blood
about
me
lo
they
keep
their
bitter
care
above
me
even
now
it
was
the
gods
who
led
me
to
this
lair
that
tho
the
burning
winds
should
make
me
weak
they
should
not
snatch
the
life
from
out
my
lips
olympus
let
the
other
women
die
they
shall
be
quiet
when
the
day
is
done
and
have
no
care
yet
for
me
there
is
no
rest
the
gods
are
not
so
kind
to
her
made
half
immortal
like
themselves
it
is
to
you
i
owe
the
cruel
gift
leda
my
mother
and
the
swan
my
sire
to
you
the
beauty
and
to
you
the
bale
for
never
woman
born
of
man
and
maid
had
wrought
such
havoc
on
the
earth
as
i
or
troubled
heaven
with
a
sea
of
flame
that
climbed
to
touch
the
silent
whirling
stars
and
blotted
out
their
brightness
ere
the
dawn
have
i
not
made
the
world
to
weep
enough
give
death
to
me
yet
life
is
more
than
death
how
could
i
leave
the
sound
of
singing
winds
the
strong
sweet
scent
that
breathes
from
off
the
sea
or
shut
my
eyes
forever
to
the
spring
i
will
not
give
the
grave
my
hands
to
hold
my
shining
hair
to
light
oblivion
have
those
who
wander
through
the
ways
of
death
the
still
wan
fields
elysian
any
love
to
lift
their
breasts
with
longing
any
lips
to
thirst
against
the
quiver
of
a
kiss
lo
i
shall
live
to
conquer
greece
again
to
make
the
people
love
who
hate
me
now
my
dreams
are
over
i
have
ceased
to
cry
against
the
fate
that
made
men
love
my
mouth
and
left
their
spirits
all
too
deaf
to
hear
the
little
songs
that
echoed
through
my
soul
i
have
no
anger
now
the
dreams
are
done
yet
since
the
greeks
and
trojans
would
not
see
aught
but
my
body
fairness
till
the
end
in
all
the
islands
set
in
all
the
seas
and
all
the
lands
that
lie
beneath
the
sun
till
light
turn
darkness
and
till
time
shall
sleep
men
lives
shall
waste
with
longing
after
me
for
i
shall
be
the
sum
of
their
desire
the
whole
of
beauty
never
seen
again
and
they
shall
stretch
their
arms
and
starting
wake
with
helen
on
their
lips
and
in
their
eyes
the
vision
of
me
always
i
shall
be
limned
on
the
darkness
like
a
shaft
of
light
that
glimmers
and
is
gone
they
shall
behold
each
one
his
dream
that
fashions
me
anew
with
hair
like
lakes
that
glint
beneath
the
stars
dark
as
sweet
midnight
or
with
hair
aglow
like
burnished
gold
that
still
retains
the
fire
yea
i
shall
haunt
until
the
dusk
of
time
the
heavy
eyelids
filled
with
fleeting
dreams
i
wait
for
one
who
comes
with
sword
to
slay
the
king
i
wronged
who
searches
for
me
now
and
yet
he
shall
not
slay
me
i
shall
stand
with
lifted
head
and
look
within
his
eyes
baring
my
breast
to
him
and
to
the
sun
he
shall
not
have
the
power
to
stain
with
blood
that
whiteness
for
the
thirsty
sword
shall
fall
and
he
shall
cry
and
catch
me
in
his
arms
bearing
me
back
to
sparta
on
his
breast
lo
i
shall
live
to
conquer
greece
again
beatrice
send
out
the
singers
let
the
room
be
still
they
have
not
eased
my
pain
nor
brought
me
sleep
close
out
the
sun
for
i
would
have
it
dark
that
i
may
feel
how
black
the
grave
will
be
the
sun
is
setting
for
the
light
is
red
and
you
are
outlined
in
a
golden
fire
like
ursula
upon
an
come
leave
the
light
and
sit
beside
my
bed
for
i
have
had
enough
of
saints
and
prayers
strange
broken
thoughts
are
beating
in
my
brain
they
come
and
vanish
and
again
they
come
it
is
the
fever
driving
out
my
soul
and
death
stands
waiting
by
the
arras
there
ornella
i
will
speak
for
soon
my
lips
shall
keep
a
silence
till
the
end
of
time
you
have
a
mouth
for
loving
listen
then
keep
tryst
with
love
before
death
comes
to
tryst
for
i
who
die
could
wish
that
i
had
lived
a
little
closer
to
the
world
of
men
not
watching
always
thro
the
blazoned
panes
that
show
the
world
in
chilly
greens
and
blues
and
grudge
the
sunshine
that
would
enter
in
i
was
no
part
of
all
the
troubled
crowd
that
moved
beneath
the
palace
windows
here
and
yet
sometimes
a
knight
in
shining
steel
would
pass
and
catch
the
gleaming
of
my
hair
and
wave
a
mailed
hand
and
smile
at
me
whereat
i
made
no
sign
and
turned
away
affrighted
and
yet
glad
and
full
of
dreams
ah
dreams
and
dreams
that
asked
no
answering
i
should
have
wrought
to
make
my
dreams
come
true
but
all
my
life
was
like
an
autumn
day
full
of
gray
quiet
and
a
hazy
peace
what
was
i
saying
all
is
gone
again
it
seemed
but
now
i
was
the
little
child
who
played
within
a
garden
long
ago
beyond
the
walls
the
festal
trumpets
blared
perhaps
they
carried
some
madonna
by
with
tossing
ensigns
in
a
sea
of
flowers
a
painted
virgin
with
a
painted
child
who
saw
for
once
the
sweetness
of
the
sun
before
they
shut
her
in
an
where
tapers
smoke
against
the
windy
gloom
i
gathered
roses
redder
than
my
gown
and
played
that
i
was
saint
elizabeth
whose
wine
had
turned
to
roses
in
her
hands
and
as
i
played
a
child
came
thro
the
gate
a
boy
who
looked
at
me
without
a
word
as
tho
he
saw
stretch
far
behind
my
head
long
lines
of
radiant
angels
row
on
row
that
day
we
spoke
a
little
timidly
and
after
that
i
never
heard
the
voice
that
sang
so
many
songs
for
love
of
me
he
was
content
to
stand
and
watch
me
pass
to
seek
for
me
at
matins
every
day
where
i
could
feel
his
eyes
the
while
i
prayed
i
think
if
he
had
stretched
his
hands
to
me
or
moved
his
lips
to
say
a
single
word
i
might
have
loved
him
he
had
wondrous
eyes
ornella
are
you
there
i
can
not
see
is
every
one
so
lonely
when
he
dies
the
room
is
filled
with
lights
with
waving
lights
who
are
the
men
and
women
the
bed
what
have
i
said
ornella
have
they
heard
there
was
no
evil
hidden
in
my
life
and
yet
and
yet
i
would
not
have
them
know
am
i
not
floating
in
a
mist
of
light
o
lift
me
up
and
i
shall
reach
the
sun
sappho
the
twilight
inner
flame
grows
blue
and
deep
and
in
my
lesbos
over
leagues
of
sea
the
temples
glimmer
moonwise
in
the
trees
twilight
has
veiled
the
little
flower
face
here
on
my
heart
but
still
the
night
is
kind
and
leaves
her
warm
sweet
weight
against
my
breast
am
i
that
sappho
who
would
run
at
dusk
along
the
surges
creeping
up
the
shore
when
tides
came
in
to
ease
the
hungry
beach
and
running
running
till
the
night
was
black
would
fall
forespent
upon
the
chilly
sand
and
quiver
with
the
winds
from
off
the
sea
ah
quietly
the
shingle
waits
the
tides
whose
waves
are
stinging
kisses
but
to
me
love
brought
no
peace
nor
darkness
any
rest
i
crept
and
touched
the
foam
with
fevered
hands
and
cried
to
love
from
whom
the
sea
is
sweet
from
whom
the
sea
is
bitterer
than
death
ah
aphrodite
if
i
sing
no
more
to
thee
god
daughter
powerful
as
god
it
is
that
thou
hast
made
my
life
too
sweet
to
hold
the
added
sweetness
of
a
song
there
is
a
quiet
at
the
heart
of
love
and
i
have
pierced
the
pain
and
come
to
peace
i
hold
my
peace
my
cleis
on
my
heart
and
softer
than
a
little
wild
bird
wing
are
kisses
that
she
pours
upon
my
mouth
ah
never
any
more
when
spring
like
fire
will
flicker
in
the
newly
opened
leaves
shall
i
steal
forth
to
seek
for
solitude
beyond
the
lure
of
light
alcaeus
lyre
beyond
the
sob
that
stilled
erinna
voice
ah
never
with
a
throat
that
aches
with
song
beneath
the
white
uncaring
sky
of
spring
shall
i
go
forth
to
hide
awhile
from
love
the
quiver
and
the
crying
of
my
heart
still
i
remember
how
i
strove
to
flee
the
of
the
birds
and
bowed
my
head
to
hurry
faster
but
upon
the
ground
i
saw
two
winged
shadows
side
by
side
and
all
the
world
spring
passion
stifled
me
ah
love
there
is
no
fleeing
from
thy
might
no
lonely
place
where
thou
hast
never
trod
no
desert
thou
hast
left
uncarpeted
with
flowers
that
spring
beneath
thy
perfect
feet
in
many
guises
didst
thou
come
to
me
i
saw
thee
by
the
maidens
while
they
danced
phaon
allured
me
with
a
look
of
thine
in
anactoria
i
knew
thy
grace
i
looked
at
cercolas
and
saw
thine
eyes
but
never
wholly
soul
and
body
mine
didst
thou
bid
any
love
me
as
i
loved
now
i
have
found
the
peace
that
fled
from
me
close
close
against
my
heart
i
hold
my
world
ah
love
that
made
my
life
a
lyric
cry
ah
love
that
tuned
my
lips
to
lyres
of
thine
i
taught
the
world
thy
music
now
alone
i
sing
for
one
who
falls
asleep
to
hear
marianna
alcoforando
the
portuguese
nun
the
sparrows
wake
beneath
the
convent
eaves
i
think
i
have
not
slept
the
whole
night
through
but
i
am
old
the
aged
scarcely
know
the
times
they
wake
and
sleep
for
life
burns
down
they
breathe
the
calm
of
death
before
they
die
the
long
night
ends
the
day
comes
creeping
in
showing
the
sorrows
that
the
darkness
hid
the
bended
head
of
christ
the
blood
the
thorns
the
wall
gray
stains
of
damp
the
pallet
bed
where
little
sister
marta
dreams
of
saints
waking
with
arms
outstretched
imploringly
that
seek
to
stay
a
vision
vanishing
i
never
had
a
vision
yet
for
me
our
lady
smiled
while
all
the
convent
slept
one
winter
midnight
hushed
around
with
snow
i
thought
she
might
be
kinder
than
the
rest
and
so
i
came
to
kneel
before
her
feet
sick
with
love
sorrow
and
love
bitterness
but
when
i
would
have
made
the
blessed
sign
i
found
the
water
frozen
in
the
font
and
touched
but
ice
within
the
carved
stone
the
saints
had
hid
themselves
away
from
me
leaving
the
windows
black
against
the
night
and
when
i
sank
upon
the
altar
steps
before
the
virgin
mother
and
her
child
the
last
pale
taper
flickered
out
but
in
the
darkness
smooth
and
fathomless
still
twinkled
like
a
star
the
holy
lamp
that
cast
a
dusky
glow
upon
her
face
then
through
the
numbing
cold
peace
fell
on
me
submission
and
the
gracious
gift
of
tears
for
when
i
looked
oh
blessed
miracle
her
lips
had
parted
and
our
lady
smiled
and
then
i
knew
that
love
is
worth
its
pain
and
that
my
heart
was
richer
for
his
sake
since
lack
of
love
is
bitterest
of
all
the
day
is
broad
awake
the
first
long
beam
of
level
sun
finds
sister
marta
face
and
trembling
there
it
lights
a
timid
smile
upon
the
lips
that
say
so
many
prayers
and
have
no
words
for
hate
and
none
for
love
but
when
she
passes
where
her
prayers
have
gone
will
god
not
smile
a
little
sadly
then
and
send
her
back
with
gentle
words
to
earth
that
she
may
hold
a
child
against
her
breast
and
feel
its
little
hands
upon
her
hair
we
weep
before
the
blessed
mother
shrine
to
think
upon
her
sorrows
but
her
joys
what
nun
could
ever
know
a
tithing
of
the
precious
hours
she
watched
above
his
sleep
were
worth
the
fearful
anguish
of
the
end
yea
lack
of
love
is
bitterest
of
all
yet
i
have
felt
what
thing
it
is
to
know
one
thought
forever
sleeping
or
awake
to
say
one
name
whose
sweetness
grows
so
strange
that
it
might
work
a
spell
on
those
who
weep
to
feel
the
weight
of
love
upon
my
heart
so
heavy
that
the
blood
can
scarcely
flow
love
comes
to
some
quietly
as
when
at
twilight
with
a
soft
surprise
we
see
the
crescent
in
the
blue
and
unto
others
love
is
a
cold
and
placid
gleam
that
wavers
not
and
there
are
those
who
wait
the
call
of
love
expectant
of
his
coming
as
we
watch
to
see
the
east
grow
pallid
ere
the
moon
lifts
up
her
head
against
the
night
love
came
to
me
as
comes
a
cruel
sun
that
on
some
morning
when
the
leaves
are
bowed
beneath
their
clinging
weight
of
drops
tears
through
the
mist
and
burns
with
fervent
heat
the
tender
grasses
and
the
meadow
flowers
then
suddenly
the
heavy
clouds
close
in
and
through
the
dark
the
thunder
muttering
is
drowned
amid
the
dashing
of
the
rain
but
i
have
seen
my
day
grow
calm
again
the
sun
sets
slowly
on
a
peaceful
world
and
sheds
a
quiet
light
across
the
fields
guenevere
i
was
a
queen
and
i
have
lost
my
crown
a
wife
and
i
have
broken
all
my
vows
a
lover
and
i
ruined
him
i
loved
there
is
no
other
havoc
left
to
do
a
little
month
ago
i
was
a
queen
and
mothers
held
their
babies
up
to
see
when
i
came
riding
out
of
camelot
the
women
smiled
and
all
the
world
smiled
too
and
now
what
woman
eyes
would
smile
on
me
i
still
am
beautiful
and
yet
what
child
would
think
of
me
as
some
high
thing
an
angel
clad
in
gold
and
miniver
the
world
would
run
from
me
and
yet
am
i
no
different
from
the
queen
they
used
to
love
if
water
flowing
silver
over
stones
is
forded
and
beneath
the
horses
feet
grows
turbid
suddenly
it
clears
again
and
men
will
drink
it
with
no
thought
of
harm
yet
i
am
branded
for
a
single
fault
i
was
the
flower
amid
a
toiling
world
where
people
smiled
to
see
one
happy
thing
and
they
were
proud
and
glad
to
raise
me
high
they
only
asked
that
i
should
be
right
fair
a
little
kind
and
gowned
wondrously
and
surely
it
were
little
praise
to
me
if
i
had
pleased
them
well
throughout
my
life
i
was
a
queen
the
daughter
of
a
king
the
crown
was
never
heavy
on
my
head
it
was
my
right
and
was
a
part
of
me
the
women
thought
me
proud
the
men
were
kind
and
bowed
right
gallantly
to
kiss
my
hand
and
watched
me
as
i
passed
them
calmly
by
along
the
halls
i
shall
not
tread
again
what
if
i
should
revisit
them
the
warders
at
the
gates
the
the
very
beggars
would
stand
off
from
me
and
i
their
queen
would
climb
the
stairs
alone
pass
through
the
a
loathed
thing
and
seek
my
chambers
for
a
and
i
should
find
them
but
a
sepulchre
the
very
rushes
rotted
on
the
floors
the
fire
in
ashes
on
the
freezing
hearth
i
was
a
queen
and
he
who
loved
me
best
made
me
a
woman
for
a
night
and
day
and
now
i
go
unqueened
forevermore
a
queen
should
never
dream
on
summer
eves
when
hovering
spells
are
heavy
in
the
dusk
i
think
no
night
was
ever
quite
so
still
so
smoothly
lit
with
red
along
the
west
so
deeply
hushed
with
quiet
through
and
through
and
strangely
clear
and
deeply
dyed
with
light
the
trees
stood
straight
against
a
paling
sky
with
venus
burning
in
the
west
i
walked
alone
amid
a
thousand
flowers
that
drooped
their
heads
and
drowsed
beneath
the
dew
and
all
my
thoughts
were
quieted
to
sleep
behind
me
on
the
walk
i
heard
a
step
i
did
not
know
my
heart
could
tell
his
tread
i
did
not
know
i
loved
him
till
that
hour
within
my
breast
i
felt
a
wild
sick
pain
the
garden
reeled
a
little
i
was
weak
and
quick
he
came
behind
me
caught
my
arms
that
ached
beneath
his
touch
and
then
i
swayed
my
head
fell
backward
and
i
saw
his
face
all
this
grows
bitter
that
was
once
so
sweet
and
many
mouths
must
drain
the
dregs
of
it
but
none
will
pity
me
nor
pity
him
whom
love
so
lashed
and
with
such
cruel
thongs
erinna
they
sent
you
in
to
say
farewell
to
me
no
do
not
shake
your
head
i
see
your
eyes
that
shine
with
tears
sappho
you
saw
the
sun
just
now
when
you
came
hither
and
again
when
you
have
left
me
all
the
shimmering
great
meadows
will
laugh
lightly
and
the
sun
put
round
about
you
warm
invisible
arms
as
might
a
lover
decking
you
with
light
i
go
toward
darkness
tho
i
lie
so
still
if
i
could
see
the
sun
i
should
look
up
and
drink
the
light
until
my
eyes
were
blind
i
should
kneel
down
and
kiss
the
blades
of
grass
and
i
should
call
the
birds
with
such
a
voice
with
such
a
longing
tremulous
and
keen
that
they
would
fly
to
me
and
on
the
breast
bear
evermore
to
and
to
fields
the
kiss
i
gave
them
sappho
tell
me
this
was
i
not
sometimes
fair
my
eyes
my
mouth
my
hair
that
loved
the
wind
were
they
not
worth
the
breath
of
love
upon
them
yet
he
passed
and
he
will
pass
when
all
the
air
is
blue
with
twilight
but
i
shall
not
see
i
shall
have
gone
forever
hold
my
hands
hold
fast
that
death
may
never
come
between
swear
by
the
gods
you
will
not
let
me
go
make
songs
for
death
as
you
would
sing
to
love
but
you
will
not
assuage
him
he
alone
of
all
the
gods
will
take
no
gifts
from
men
i
am
afraid
afraid
sappho
lean
down
last
night
the
fever
gave
a
dream
to
me
it
takes
my
life
and
gives
a
little
dream
i
thought
i
saw
him
stand
the
man
i
love
here
in
my
quiet
chamber
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
me
as
i
entered
while
he
drew
silently
toward
me
he
who
night
by
night
goes
by
my
door
without
a
thought
of
me
neared
me
and
put
his
hand
behind
my
head
and
leaning
toward
me
kissed
me
on
the
mouth
that
was
a
little
dream
for
death
to
give
too
short
to
take
the
whole
of
life
for
yet
i
woke
with
lips
made
quiet
by
a
kiss
the
dream
is
worth
the
dying
do
not
smile
so
sadly
on
me
with
your
shining
eyes
you
who
can
set
your
sorrow
to
a
song
and
ease
your
hurt
by
singing
but
to
me
my
songs
are
less
than
that
the
wind
drives
stinging
over
me
and
bears
away
i
have
no
care
what
place
the
grains
may
fall
nor
of
my
songs
if
time
shall
blow
them
back
as
breaks
the
lines
of
dying
foam
along
the
bright
wet
beaches
scattering
the
flakes
once
more
against
the
laboring
sea
into
oblivion
what
care
have
i
to
please
apollo
since
love
hearkens
not
your
words
will
live
forever
men
will
say
she
was
the
perfect
lover
i
shall
die
i
loved
too
much
to
live
go
sappho
go
i
hate
your
hands
that
beat
so
full
of
life
go
lest
my
hatred
hurt
you
i
shall
die
but
you
will
live
to
love
and
love
again
he
might
have
loved
some
other
spring
than
this
i
should
have
kept
my
life
i
let
it
go
he
would
not
love
me
now
tho
cypris
bound
her
girdle
round
me
i
am
death
not
love
go
from
me
sappho
back
to
find
the
sun
i
am
alone
alone
o
cyprian
love
songs
song
you
bound
strong
sandals
on
my
feet
you
gave
me
bread
and
wine
and
bade
me
out
sun
and
stars
for
all
the
world
was
mine
oh
take
the
sandals
off
my
feet
you
know
not
what
you
do
for
all
my
world
is
in
your
arms
my
sun
and
stars
are
you
the
rose
and
the
bee
if
i
were
a
bee
and
you
were
a
rose
would
you
let
me
in
when
the
gray
wind
blows
would
you
hold
your
petals
wide
apart
would
you
let
me
in
to
find
your
heart
if
you
were
a
rose
if
i
were
a
rose
and
you
were
a
bee
you
should
never
go
when
you
came
to
me
i
should
hold
my
love
on
my
heart
at
last
i
should
close
my
leaves
and
keep
you
fast
if
you
were
a
bee
the
song
maker
i
made
a
hundred
little
songs
that
told
the
joy
and
pain
of
love
and
sang
them
blithely
tho
i
knew
no
whit
thereof
i
was
a
weaver
deaf
and
blind
a
miracle
was
wrought
for
me
but
i
have
lost
my
skill
to
weave
since
i
can
see
for
while
i
sang
ah
swift
and
strange
love
passed
and
touched
me
on
the
brow
and
i
who
made
so
many
songs
am
silent
now
wild
asters
in
the
spring
i
asked
the
daisies
if
his
words
were
true
and
the
clever
little
daisies
always
knew
now
the
fields
are
brown
and
barren
bitter
autumn
blows
and
of
all
the
stupid
asters
not
one
knows
when
love
goes
i
o
mother
i
am
sick
of
love
i
can
not
laugh
nor
lift
my
head
my
bitter
dreams
have
broken
me
i
would
my
love
were
dead
drink
of
the
draught
i
brew
for
thee
thou
shalt
have
quiet
in
its
stead
ii
where
is
the
silver
in
the
rain
where
is
the
music
in
the
sea
where
is
the
bird
that
sang
all
day
to
break
my
heart
with
melody
the
night
thou
badst
love
fly
away
he
hid
them
all
from
thee
the
wayfarer
love
entered
in
my
heart
one
day
a
sad
unwelcome
guest
but
when
he
begged
that
he
might
stay
i
let
him
wait
and
rest
he
broke
my
sleep
with
sorrowing
and
shook
my
dreams
with
tears
and
when
my
heart
was
fain
to
sing
he
stilled
its
joy
with
fears
but
now
that
he
has
gone
his
way
i
miss
the
old
sweet
pain
and
sometimes
in
the
night
i
pray
that
he
may
come
again
the
princess
in
the
tower
i
the
princess
sings
i
am
the
princess
up
in
the
tower
and
i
dream
the
whole
day
of
a
knight
who
shall
come
with
a
silver
spear
and
a
waving
plume
of
blue
i
am
the
princess
up
in
the
tower
and
i
dream
my
dreams
by
day
but
sometimes
i
wake
and
my
eyes
are
wet
when
the
dusk
is
deep
and
gray
for
the
peasant
lovers
go
by
beneath
i
hear
them
laugh
and
kiss
and
i
forget
my
knight
and
long
for
a
love
like
this
ii
the
minstrel
sings
i
lie
beside
the
princess
tower
so
close
she
can
not
see
my
face
and
watch
her
dreaming
all
day
long
and
bending
with
a
lily
grace
her
cheeks
are
paler
than
the
moon
that
sails
along
a
sunny
sky
and
yet
her
silent
mouth
is
red
where
tender
words
and
kisses
lie
i
am
a
minstrel
with
a
harp
for
love
of
her
my
songs
are
sweet
and
yet
i
dare
not
lift
the
voice
that
lies
so
far
beneath
her
feet
iii
the
knight
sings
o
princess
cease
your
dreams
awhile
and
look
adown
your
tower
gray
side
the
princess
gazes
far
away
nor
hears
nor
heeds
the
words
i
cried
perchance
my
heart
was
overbold
god
made
her
dreams
too
pure
to
break
she
sees
the
angels
in
the
air
fly
to
and
fro
for
mary
sake
farewell
i
mount
and
go
my
way
but
oh
her
hair
the
sun
sifts
thro
the
tilts
and
tourneys
wait
my
spear
i
am
the
knight
of
the
plume
of
blue
when
love
was
born
when
love
was
born
i
think
he
lay
right
warm
on
venus
breast
and
whiles
he
smiled
and
whiles
would
play
and
whiles
would
take
his
rest
but
always
folded
out
of
sight
the
wings
were
growing
strong
that
were
to
bear
him
off
in
flight
erelong
erelong
the
shrine
there
is
no
lord
within
my
heart
left
silent
as
an
empty
shrine
where
rose
and
myrtle
intertwine
within
a
place
apart
no
god
is
there
of
carven
stone
to
watch
with
still
approving
eyes
my
thoughts
like
steady
incense
rise
i
dream
and
weep
alone
but
if
i
keep
my
altar
fair
some
morning
i
shall
lift
my
head
from
roses
deftly
garlanded
to
find
the
god
is
there
the
blind
the
birds
are
all
they
say
the
world
and
still
i
linger
lonely
within
a
barren
bower
i
weave
a
web
of
fancies
of
tears
and
darkness
spun
how
shall
i
sing
of
sunlight
who
never
saw
the
sun
i
hear
the
pipes
but
yet
i
may
not
dance
i
know
that
love
is
passing
i
can
not
catch
his
glance
and
if
his
voice
should
call
me
and
i
with
groping
dim
should
reach
his
place
of
calling
and
stretch
my
arms
to
him
the
wind
would
blow
between
my
hands
for
joy
that
i
shall
miss
the
rain
would
fall
upon
my
mouth
that
his
will
never
kiss
love
me
singing
all
day
long
in
the
leaves
above
me
take
my
love
this
little
song
love
me
love
me
love
me
when
he
harkens
what
you
say
bid
him
lest
he
miss
me
leave
his
work
or
leave
his
play
and
kiss
me
kiss
me
kiss
me
the
song
for
colin
i
sang
a
song
at
dusking
time
beneath
the
evening
star
and
terence
left
his
latest
rhyme
to
answer
from
afar
pierrot
laid
down
his
lute
to
weep
and
sighed
she
sings
for
me
but
colin
slept
a
careless
sleep
beneath
an
apple
tree
four
winds
four
winds
blowing
thro
the
sky
you
have
seen
poor
maidens
die
tell
me
then
what
i
shall
do
that
my
lover
may
be
true
said
the
wind
from
out
the
south
lay
no
kiss
upon
his
mouth
and
the
wind
from
out
the
west
wound
the
heart
within
his
breast
and
the
wind
from
out
the
east
send
him
empty
from
the
feast
and
the
wind
from
out
the
north
in
the
tempest
thrust
him
forth
when
thou
art
more
cruel
than
he
then
will
love
be
kind
to
thee
roundel
if
he
could
know
my
songs
are
all
for
him
at
silver
dawn
or
in
the
evening
glow
would
he
not
smile
and
think
it
but
a
whim
if
he
could
know
or
would
his
heart
rejoice
and
overflow
as
happy
brooks
that
break
their
icy
rim
when
april
horns
along
the
hillsides
blow
i
may
not
speak
till
eros
torch
is
dim
the
god
is
bitter
and
will
have
it
so
and
yet
our
fate
would
seem
less
grim
if
he
could
know
dew
i
dream
that
he
is
mine
i
dream
that
he
is
true
and
all
his
words
i
keep
as
hold
the
dew
o
little
thirsty
rose
o
little
heart
beware
lest
you
should
hope
to
hold
a
hundred
roses
share
a
maiden
oh
if
i
were
the
velvet
rose
upon
the
red
rose
vine
i
climb
to
touch
his
window
and
make
his
casement
fine
and
if
i
were
the
little
bird
that
twitters
on
the
tree
all
day
i
sing
my
love
for
him
till
he
should
harken
me
but
since
i
am
a
maiden
i
go
with
downcast
eyes
and
he
will
never
hear
the
songs
that
he
has
turned
to
sighs
and
since
i
am
a
maiden
my
love
will
never
know
that
i
could
kiss
him
with
a
mouth
more
red
than
roses
blow
i
love
you
when
april
bends
above
me
and
finds
me
fast
asleep
dust
need
not
keep
the
secret
a
live
heart
died
to
keep
when
april
tells
the
thrushes
the
will
know
and
pipe
the
three
words
lightly
to
all
the
winds
that
blow
above
his
roof
the
swallows
in
notes
like
rain
will
tell
the
little
sparrow
beside
his
o
sparrow
little
sparrow
when
i
am
fast
asleep
then
tell
my
love
the
secret
that
i
have
died
to
keep
but
not
to
me
the
april
night
is
still
and
sweet
with
flowers
on
every
tree
peace
comes
to
them
on
quiet
feet
but
not
to
me
my
peace
is
hidden
in
his
breast
where
i
shall
never
be
love
comes
to
all
the
rest
but
not
to
me
hidden
love
i
hid
the
love
within
my
heart
and
lit
the
laughter
in
my
eyes
that
when
we
meet
he
may
not
know
my
love
that
never
dies
but
sometimes
when
he
dreams
at
night
of
fragrant
forests
green
and
dim
it
may
be
that
my
love
crept
out
and
brought
the
dream
to
him
and
sometimes
when
his
heart
is
sick
and
suddenly
grows
well
again
it
may
be
that
my
love
was
there
to
free
his
life
of
pain
snow
song
fairy
snow
fairy
snow
blowing
blowing
everywhere
would
that
i
too
could
fly
lightly
lightly
through
the
air
like
a
wee
crystal
star
i
should
drift
i
should
blow
near
more
near
to
my
dear
where
he
comes
through
the
snow
i
should
fly
to
my
love
like
a
flake
in
the
storm
i
should
die
i
should
die
on
his
lips
that
are
warm
youth
and
the
pilgrim
gray
pilgrim
you
have
journeyed
far
i
pray
you
tell
to
me
is
there
a
land
where
love
is
not
by
shore
of
any
sea
for
i
am
weary
of
the
god
and
i
would
flee
from
him
tho
i
must
take
a
ship
and
go
beyond
the
ocean
rim
i
know
a
port
where
love
is
not
the
ship
is
in
your
hand
then
plunge
your
sword
within
your
breast
and
you
will
reach
the
land
the
wanderer
i
saw
the
sands
the
nile
like
flowing
fire
between
where
rameses
stares
forth
serene
and
ammon
heavy
temple
stands
i
saw
the
rocks
where
long
ago
above
the
sea
that
cries
and
breaks
bright
perseus
with
medusa
snakes
set
free
the
maiden
white
like
snow
and
many
skies
have
covered
me
and
many
winds
have
blown
me
forth
and
i
have
loved
the
green
bright
north
and
i
have
loved
the
cold
sweet
sea
but
what
to
me
are
north
and
south
and
what
the
lure
of
many
lands
since
you
have
leaned
to
catch
my
hands
and
lay
a
kiss
upon
my
mouth
i
would
live
in
your
love
i
would
live
in
your
love
as
the
live
in
the
sea
borne
up
by
each
wave
as
it
passes
drawn
down
by
each
wave
that
recedes
i
would
empty
my
soul
of
the
dreams
that
have
gathered
in
me
i
would
beat
with
your
heart
as
it
beats
i
would
follow
your
soul
as
it
leads
may
the
wind
is
tossing
the
lilacs
the
new
leaves
laugh
in
the
sun
and
the
petals
fall
on
the
orchard
wall
but
for
me
the
spring
is
done
beneath
the
apple
blossoms
i
go
a
wintry
way
for
love
that
smiled
in
april
is
false
to
me
in
may
rispetto
was
that
his
step
that
sounded
on
the
stair
was
that
his
knock
i
heard
upon
the
door
i
grow
so
tired
i
almost
cease
to
care
and
yet
i
would
that
he
might
come
once
more
it
was
the
wind
i
heard
that
mocks
at
me
the
bitter
wind
that
is
more
cruel
than
he
it
was
the
wind
that
knocked
upon
the
door
but
he
will
never
knock
nor
enter
more
less
than
the
cloud
to
the
wind
less
than
the
cloud
to
the
wind
less
than
the
foam
to
the
sea
less
than
the
rose
to
the
storm
am
i
to
thee
more
than
the
star
to
the
night
more
than
the
rain
to
the
lea
more
than
heaven
to
earth
art
thou
to
me
buried
love
i
shall
bury
my
weary
love
beneath
a
tree
in
the
forest
tall
and
black
where
none
can
see
i
shall
put
no
flowers
at
his
head
nor
stone
at
his
feet
for
the
mouth
i
loved
so
much
was
bittersweet
i
shall
go
no
more
to
his
grave
for
the
woods
are
cold
i
shall
gather
as
much
of
joy
as
my
hands
can
hold
i
shall
stay
all
day
in
the
sun
where
the
wide
winds
blow
but
oh
i
shall
weep
at
night
when
none
will
know
song
o
woe
is
me
my
heart
is
sad
for
i
should
never
know
if
love
came
by
like
any
lad
without
his
silver
bow
or
if
he
left
his
arrows
sharp
and
came
a
minstrel
weary
i
never
tell
him
by
his
harp
nor
know
him
for
my
dearie
o
go
your
ways
and
have
no
fear
for
tho
love
passes
by
he
come
a
hundred
times
my
dear
before
your
turn
to
die
pierrot
pierrot
stands
in
the
garden
beneath
a
waning
moon
and
on
his
lute
he
fashions
a
little
silver
tune
pierrot
plays
in
the
garden
he
thinks
he
plays
for
me
but
i
am
quite
forgotten
under
the
cherry
tree
pierrot
plays
in
the
garden
and
all
the
roses
know
that
pierrot
loves
his
music
but
i
love
pierrot
at
night
love
said
wake
still
and
think
of
me
sleep
close
your
eyes
till
break
of
day
but
dreams
came
by
and
smilingly
gave
both
to
love
and
sleep
their
way
song
when
love
comes
singing
to
his
heart
that
would
not
wake
for
me
i
think
that
i
shall
know
his
joy
by
my
own
ecstasy
and
tho
the
sea
were
all
between
the
time
their
hands
shall
meet
my
heart
will
know
his
happiness
so
wildly
it
will
beat
and
when
he
bends
above
her
mouth
rejoicing
for
his
sake
my
soul
will
sing
a
little
song
but
oh
my
heart
will
break
love
in
autumn
i
sought
among
the
drifting
leaves
the
golden
leaves
that
once
were
green
to
see
if
love
were
hiding
there
and
peeping
out
between
for
thro
the
silver
showers
of
may
and
thro
the
summer
heavy
heat
in
vain
i
sought
his
golden
head
and
light
feet
perhaps
when
all
the
world
is
bare
and
cruel
winter
holds
the
land
the
love
that
finds
no
place
to
hide
will
run
and
catch
my
hand
i
shall
not
care
to
have
him
then
i
shall
be
bitter
and
it
grows
too
late
for
frolicking
when
all
the
world
is
old
then
little
hiding
love
come
forth
come
forth
before
the
autumn
goes
and
let
us
seek
thro
ruined
paths
the
garden
last
red
rose
the
kiss
i
hoped
that
he
would
love
me
and
he
has
kissed
my
mouth
but
i
am
like
a
stricken
bird
that
can
not
reach
the
south
for
tho
i
know
he
loves
me
my
heart
is
sad
his
kiss
was
not
so
wonderful
as
all
the
dreams
i
had
november
the
world
is
tired
the
year
is
old
the
little
leaves
are
glad
to
die
the
wind
goes
shivering
with
cold
among
the
rushes
dry
our
love
is
dying
like
the
grass
and
we
who
kissed
grow
coldly
kind
half
glad
to
see
our
poor
love
pass
like
leaves
along
the
wind
a
song
of
the
princess
the
princess
has
her
lovers
a
score
of
knights
has
she
and
each
can
sing
a
madrigal
and
praise
her
gracefully
but
love
that
is
so
bitter
hath
put
within
her
heart
a
longing
for
the
scornful
knight
who
silent
stands
apart
and
tho
the
others
praise
and
plead
she
maketh
no
reply
yet
for
a
single
word
from
him
i
ween
that
she
would
die
the
wind
a
wind
is
blowing
over
my
soul
i
hear
it
cry
the
whole
night
thro
is
there
no
peace
for
me
on
earth
except
with
you
alas
the
wind
has
made
me
wise
over
my
naked
soul
it
blew
there
is
no
peace
for
me
on
earth
even
with
you
a
winter
night
my
is
starred
with
frost
the
world
is
bitter
cold
the
moon
is
cruel
and
the
wind
is
like
a
sword
to
smite
god
pity
all
the
homeless
ones
the
beggars
pacing
to
and
fro
god
pity
all
the
poor
who
walk
the
streets
of
snow
my
room
is
like
a
bit
of
june
warm
and
fold
on
fold
but
somewhere
like
a
homeless
child
my
heart
is
crying
in
the
cold
the
metropolitan
tower
we
walked
together
in
the
dusk
to
watch
the
tower
grow
dimly
white
and
saw
it
lift
against
the
sky
its
flower
of
amber
light
you
talked
of
half
a
hundred
things
i
kept
each
little
word
you
said
and
when
at
last
the
hour
was
full
i
saw
the
light
turn
red
you
did
not
know
the
time
had
come
you
did
not
see
the
sudden
flower
nor
know
that
in
my
heart
love
birth
was
reckoned
from
that
hour
gramercy
park
for
the
little
park
was
filled
with
peace
the
walks
were
carpeted
with
snow
but
every
iron
gate
was
locked
lest
if
we
entered
peace
would
go
we
circled
it
a
dozen
times
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
sea
i
only
felt
your
restless
eyes
whose
love
was
like
a
cloak
for
me
oh
heavy
gates
that
fate
has
locked
to
bar
the
joy
we
may
not
win
peace
would
go
out
forevermore
if
we
should
dare
to
enter
in
in
the
metropolitan
museum
within
the
tiny
pantheon
we
stood
together
silently
leaving
the
restless
crowd
awhile
as
ships
find
shelter
from
the
sea
the
ancient
centuries
came
back
to
cover
us
a
moment
space
and
thro
the
dome
the
light
was
glad
because
it
shone
upon
your
face
ah
not
from
rome
but
farther
still
beyond
salamis
the
moment
took
us
till
you
stooped
to
find
the
present
with
a
kiss
coney
island
why
did
you
bring
me
here
the
sand
is
white
with
snow
over
the
wooden
domes
the
winter
blow
there
is
no
shelter
near
come
let
us
go
with
foam
of
icy
lace
the
sea
creeps
up
the
sand
the
wind
is
like
a
hand
that
strikes
us
in
the
face
doors
that
june
set
are
bolted
long
ago
we
try
them
uselessly
alas
there
can
not
be
for
us
a
second
spring
come
let
us
go
union
square
with
the
man
i
love
who
loves
me
not
i
walked
in
the
flare
we
watched
the
world
go
home
that
night
in
a
flood
through
union
square
i
leaned
to
catch
the
words
he
said
that
were
light
as
a
snowflake
falling
ah
well
that
he
never
leaned
to
hear
the
words
my
heart
was
calling
and
on
we
walked
and
on
we
walked
past
the
fiery
lights
of
the
picture
shows
where
the
girls
with
thirsty
eyes
go
by
on
the
errand
each
man
knows
and
on
we
walked
and
on
we
walked
at
the
door
at
last
we
said
i
knew
by
his
smile
he
had
not
heard
my
heart
unuttered
cry
with
the
man
i
love
who
loves
me
not
i
walked
in
the
flare
but
oh
the
girls
who
can
ask
for
love
in
the
lights
of
union
square
central
park
at
dusk
buildings
above
the
leafless
trees
loom
high
as
castles
in
a
dream
while
one
by
one
the
lamps
come
out
to
thread
the
twilight
with
a
gleam
there
is
no
sign
of
leaf
or
bud
a
hush
is
over
everything
silent
as
women
wait
for
love
the
world
is
waiting
for
the
spring
young
love
i
i
can
not
heed
the
words
they
say
the
lights
grow
far
away
and
dim
amid
the
laughing
men
and
maids
my
eyes
unbidden
seek
for
him
i
hope
that
when
he
smiles
at
me
he
does
not
guess
my
joy
and
pain
for
if
he
did
he
is
too
kind
to
ever
look
my
way
again
ii
i
have
a
secret
in
my
heart
no
ears
have
ever
heard
and
still
it
sings
there
day
by
day
most
like
a
caged
bird
and
when
it
beats
against
the
bars
i
do
not
set
it
free
for
i
am
happier
to
know
it
only
sings
for
me
iii
i
wrote
his
name
along
the
beach
i
love
the
letters
so
far
up
it
seemed
and
out
of
reach
for
still
the
tide
was
low
but
oh
the
sea
came
creeping
up
and
washed
the
name
away
and
on
the
sand
where
it
had
been
a
bit
of
lay
a
bit
of
on
the
sand
dropped
from
a
mermaid
hair
ah
had
she
come
to
kiss
his
name
and
leave
a
token
there
iv
what
am
i
that
he
should
love
me
he
who
stands
so
far
above
me
what
am
i
i
am
like
a
cowslip
turning
toward
the
sky
where
a
planet
golden
burning
breaks
the
cowslip
heart
with
yearning
what
am
i
that
he
should
love
me
what
am
i
v
o
dreams
that
flock
about
my
sleep
i
pray
you
bring
my
love
to
me
and
let
me
think
i
hear
his
voice
again
ring
free
and
if
you
care
to
please
me
well
and
live
in
my
mind
let
him
who
was
so
cold
before
seem
kind
vi
i
plucked
a
daisy
in
the
fields
and
there
beneath
the
sun
i
let
its
silver
petals
fall
one
after
one
i
said
he
loves
me
loves
me
not
and
oh
my
heart
beat
fast
the
flower
was
kind
it
let
me
say
he
loves
me
last
i
kissed
the
little
leafless
stem
but
oh
my
poor
heart
knew
the
words
the
flower
had
said
to
me
they
were
not
true
vii
i
sent
my
love
a
letter
and
if
he
loves
me
not
he
shall
not
find
my
love
for
him
in
any
line
or
dot
but
if
he
loves
me
truly
he
find
it
hidden
deep
as
dawn
gleams
red
thro
chilly
clouds
to
eyes
awaked
from
sleep
viii
the
world
is
cold
and
gray
and
wet
and
i
am
yet
when
i
am
home
and
look
to
see
the
place
my
letters
wait
for
me
if
i
should
find
one
letter
there
i
think
i
should
not
greatly
care
if
it
were
rainy
or
were
fair
for
all
the
world
would
suddenly
seem
like
a
festival
to
me
ix
i
hid
three
words
within
my
heart
that
longed
to
fly
to
him
at
dawn
they
woke
me
with
a
start
they
sang
till
day
was
dim
and
now
at
last
i
let
them
fly
as
little
birds
should
do
and
he
will
know
the
first
is
i
the
others
love
and
you
x
across
the
twilight
violet
his
curtained
window
glimmers
gold
oh
happy
light
that
round
my
love
can
fold
oh
happy
book
within
his
hand
oh
happy
page
he
glorifies
oh
happy
little
word
beneath
his
eyes
but
oh
thrice
happy
happy
i
who
love
him
more
than
songs
can
tell
for
in
the
heaven
of
his
heart
i
dwell
sonnets
and
lyrics
primavera
mia
as
kings
who
see
their
little
pass
take
off
the
heavy
ermine
and
the
crown
so
had
the
trees
that
laid
down
their
golden
garments
on
the
faded
grass
when
i
who
watched
the
seasons
in
the
glass
of
mine
own
thoughts
saw
all
the
autumn
brown
leap
into
life
and
don
a
sunny
gown
of
leafage
such
as
happy
april
has
great
spring
came
singing
upward
from
the
south
for
in
my
heart
far
carried
on
the
wind
your
words
like
winged
seeds
took
root
and
grew
and
all
the
world
caught
music
from
your
mouth
i
saw
the
light
as
one
who
had
been
blind
and
knew
my
sun
and
song
and
spring
were
you
soul
birth
when
you
were
born
beloved
was
your
soul
new
made
by
god
to
match
your
body
flower
and
were
they
both
at
one
same
precious
hour
sent
forth
from
heaven
as
a
perfect
whole
or
had
your
soul
since
dim
creation
burned
a
star
in
some
still
region
of
the
sky
that
leaping
earthward
left
its
place
on
high
and
to
your
little
body
yearned
no
words
can
tell
in
what
celestial
hour
god
made
your
soul
and
gave
it
mortal
birth
nor
in
the
disarray
of
all
the
stars
is
any
place
so
sweet
that
such
a
flower
might
linger
there
until
thro
heaven
bars
it
heard
god
voice
that
bade
it
down
to
earth
love
and
death
shall
we
too
rise
forgetful
from
our
sleep
and
shall
my
soul
that
lies
within
your
hand
remember
nothing
as
the
blowing
sand
forgets
the
palm
where
long
blue
shadows
creep
when
winds
along
the
darkened
desert
sweep
or
would
it
still
remember
tho
it
spanned
a
thousand
heavens
while
the
planets
fanned
the
vacant
ether
with
their
voices
deep
soul
of
my
soul
no
word
shall
be
forgot
nor
yet
alone
beloved
shall
we
see
the
desolation
of
extinguished
suns
nor
fear
the
void
wherethro
our
planet
runs
for
still
together
shall
we
go
and
not
fare
forth
alone
to
front
eternity
for
the
anniversary
of
john
keats
death
february
at
midnight
when
the
moonlit
cypress
trees
have
woven
round
his
grave
a
magic
shade
still
weeping
the
unfinished
hymn
he
made
there
moves
fresh
maia
like
a
morning
breeze
blown
over
jonquil
beds
when
warm
rains
cease
and
stooping
where
her
poet
head
is
laid
selene
weeps
while
all
the
tides
are
stayed
and
swaying
seas
are
darkened
into
peace
but
they
who
wake
the
meadows
and
the
tides
have
hearts
too
kind
to
bid
him
wake
from
sleep
who
murmurs
sometimes
when
his
dreams
are
deep
startling
the
quiet
land
where
he
abides
and
charming
still
persephone
with
visions
of
the
sunny
earth
and
sea
silence
to
eleonora
duse
we
are
anhungered
after
solitude
deep
stillness
pure
of
any
speech
or
sound
soft
quiet
hovering
over
pools
profound
the
silences
that
on
the
desert
brood
above
a
windless
hush
of
empty
seas
the
broad
unfurling
banners
of
the
dawn
a
faery
forest
where
there
sleeps
a
faun
our
souls
are
fain
of
solitudes
like
these
o
woman
who
divined
our
weariness
and
set
the
crown
of
silence
on
your
art
from
what
depth
within
your
heart
have
you
sent
forth
the
hush
that
makes
us
free
to
hear
an
instant
high
above
earth
stress
the
silent
music
of
infinity
the
return
i
turned
the
key
and
opened
wide
the
door
to
enter
my
deserted
room
again
where
thro
the
long
hot
months
the
dust
had
lain
was
it
not
lonely
when
across
the
floor
no
step
was
heard
no
sudden
song
that
bore
my
whole
heart
upward
with
a
joyous
pain
were
not
the
pictures
and
the
volumes
fain
to
have
me
with
them
always
as
before
but
giorgione
venus
did
not
deign
to
lift
her
lids
nor
did
the
subtle
smile
of
mona
lisa
deepen
madeleine
still
wept
against
the
glory
of
her
hair
nor
did
the
lovers
part
their
lips
the
while
but
kissed
unheeding
that
i
watched
them
there
fear
i
am
afraid
oh
i
am
so
afraid
the
cold
black
fear
is
clutching
me
as
long
ago
when
they
would
take
the
light
and
leave
the
little
child
who
would
have
prayed
frozen
and
sleepless
at
the
thought
of
death
my
heart
that
beats
too
fast
will
rest
too
soon
i
shall
not
know
if
it
be
night
or
noon
yet
shall
i
struggle
in
the
dark
for
breath
will
no
one
fight
the
terror
for
my
sake
the
heavy
darkness
that
no
dawn
will
break
how
can
they
leave
me
in
that
dark
alone
who
loved
the
joy
of
light
and
warmth
so
much
and
thrilled
so
with
the
sense
of
sound
and
touch
how
can
they
shut
me
underneath
a
stone
anadyomene
the
wide
bright
temple
of
the
world
i
found
and
entered
from
the
dizzy
infinite
that
i
might
kneel
and
worship
thee
in
it
leaving
the
singing
stars
their
ceaseless
round
of
silver
music
sound
on
orbed
sound
for
measured
spaces
where
the
shrines
are
lit
and
men
with
wisdom
or
with
little
wit
implore
the
gods
that
mercy
may
abound
ah
aphrodite
was
it
not
from
thee
my
summons
came
across
the
endless
spaces
mother
of
love
turn
not
thy
face
from
me
now
that
i
seek
for
thee
in
human
faces
answer
my
prayer
or
set
my
spirit
free
again
to
drift
along
the
starry
places
galahad
in
the
castle
of
the
maidens
to
the
maiden
with
the
hidden
face
in
abbey
painting
the
other
maidens
raised
their
eyes
to
him
who
stumbled
in
before
them
when
the
fight
had
left
him
victor
with
a
victor
right
i
think
his
eyes
with
quick
hot
tears
grew
dim
he
scarcely
saw
her
swaying
white
and
slim
and
trembling
slightly
dreaming
of
his
might
nor
knew
he
touched
her
hand
as
strangely
light
as
a
wan
wraith
beside
a
river
rim
the
other
maidens
raised
their
eyes
to
see
and
only
she
has
hid
her
face
away
and
yet
i
ween
she
loved
him
more
than
they
and
very
fairly
fashioned
was
her
face
yet
for
love
shame
and
sweet
humility
she
dared
not
meet
him
with
their
queenlike
grace
to
an
aeolian
harp
the
winds
have
grown
articulate
in
thee
and
voiced
again
the
wail
of
ancient
woe
that
smote
upon
the
winds
of
long
ago
the
cries
of
trojan
women
as
they
flee
the
quivering
moan
of
pale
andromache
now
lifted
loud
with
pain
and
now
brought
low
it
is
the
soul
of
sorrow
that
we
know
as
in
a
shell
the
soul
of
all
the
sea
so
sometimes
in
the
compass
of
a
song
unknown
to
him
who
sings
thro
lips
that
live
the
voiceless
dead
of
lands
proclaim
to
us
their
heaviness
and
wrong
in
sweeping
sadness
of
the
winds
that
give
thy
strings
no
rest
from
weariless
wild
hands
to
erinna
was
time
not
harsh
to
you
or
was
he
kind
o
pale
erinna
of
the
perfect
lyre
that
he
has
left
no
word
of
singing
fire
whereby
you
waked
the
dreaming
lesbian
wind
and
kindled
night
along
the
lyric
shore
o
girl
whose
lips
erato
stooped
to
kiss
do
you
go
sorrowing
because
of
this
in
fields
where
poets
sing
forevermore
or
are
you
glad
and
is
it
best
to
be
a
silent
music
men
have
never
heard
a
dream
in
all
our
souls
that
we
may
say
her
voice
had
all
the
rapture
of
the
sea
and
all
the
clear
cool
quiver
of
a
bird
deep
in
a
forest
at
the
break
of
day
to
cleis
i
have
a
fair
daughter
with
a
form
like
a
golden
flower
cleis
the
beloved
sapphic
fragment
when
the
dusk
was
wet
with
dew
cleis
did
the
muses
nine
listen
in
a
silent
line
while
your
mother
sang
to
you
did
they
weep
or
did
they
smile
when
she
crooned
to
still
your
cries
she
a
muse
in
human
guise
who
forsook
her
lyre
awhile
did
you
feel
her
wild
heart
beat
did
the
warmth
of
all
the
sun
thro
your
little
body
run
when
she
kissed
your
hands
and
feet
did
your
fingers
babywise
touch
her
face
and
touch
her
hair
did
you
think
your
mother
fair
could
you
bear
her
burning
eyes
are
the
songs
that
soothed
your
fears
vanished
like
a
vanished
flame
save
the
line
where
shines
your
name
starlike
down
the
graying
years
cleis
speaks
no
word
to
me
for
the
land
where
she
has
gone
lieth
mute
at
dusk
and
dawn
like
a
windless
tideless
sea
paris
in
spring
the
city
all
beneath
a
fickle
sun
a
gay
young
wind
the
little
shower
is
done
but
the
still
are
clinging
and
falling
one
by
one
oh
it
paris
it
paris
and

begun
i
know
the
bois
is
twinkling
in
a
sort
of
hazy
sheen
and
down
the
champs
the
gray
old
arch
stands
cold
and
still
between
but
the
walk
is
flecked
with
sunlight
where
the
great
acacias
lean
oh
it
paris
it
paris
and
the
leaves
are
growing
green
the
sun
gone
in
the
sparkle
dead
there
falls
a
dash
of
rain
but
who
would
care
when
such
an
air
comes
blowing
up
the
seine
and
still
ninette
sits
sewing
beside
her
when

paris

again
madeira
from

out
of
the
delicate
dream
of
the
distance
an
emerald
emerges
veiled
in
the
violet
folds
of
the
air
of
the
sea
softly
the
dream
grows
awakening
shimmering
white
of
a
city

of
crimson
the
gay
bougainvillea
the
palms
high
in
the
infinite
blue
of
its
heaven
a
quiet
cloud
lingers
lost
and

upon
their

the
jangle

alone

roaring

walled
in
by
granite

whose

at

the

line
down
the
splashy
gleaming

the
rain

loud
now
blurred
by
the
tread
of
homing
feet
by
the
sea

an
ebbing
northern
sea

stars
awaken
one
by
one
we
walk
together
i
and
he
he
woos
me
with
an
easy
grace
that
proves
him
only
half
sincere
a
light
smile
flickers
on
his
face
to
him
is
an
art
and
as
a
flutist
plays
a
flute
so
does
he
play
upon
his
heart
a
music
varied
to
his
whim
he
has
no
use
for
love
of
mine
he
would
not
have
me
answer
him
to
hide
my
eyes
within
the
night
i
watch
the
changeful
lighthouse
gleam
alternately
with
red
and
white
my
laughter
smites
upon
my
ears
so
one
who
cries
and
wakes
from
sleep
knows
not
it
is
himself
he
hears
what
if
my
voice
should
let
him
know
the
mocking
words
were
all
a
sham
and
lips
that
laugh
could
tremble
so
what
if
i
lost
the
power
to
lie
and
he
should
only
hear
his
name
in
one
low
broken
cry
on
the
death
of
swinburne
he
trod
the
earth
but
yesterday
and
now
he
treads
the
stars
he
left
us
in
the
april
time
he
praised
so
often
in
his
rhyme
he
left
the
singing
and
the
lyre
and
went
his
way
he
drew
new
music
from
our
tongue
a
music
subtly
wrought
and
moulded
words
to
his
desire
as
wind
doth
mould
a
wave
of
fire
from
strangely
fashioned
harps
slow
golden
tones

wrung
i
think
the
singing
understands
that
he
who
sang
is
still
and
iseult
cries
that
he
is
dead

not

her
head
and
fragoletta
weep
and
wring
her
little
hands

of

two
knights
rode
forth
at
early
dawn
maids
to
wed
said
one
my
lady
must
be
fair
with
gold
hair
on
her
head
then
spake
the
other
i
care
not
for
her
face
but
she
i
love
must
be
a
dove
for
purity
and
grace
and
each
knight
blew
upon
his
horn
and
went
his
separate
way
and
each
knight
found
a
before
the
fall
of
day
but
she
was
brown
who
should
have
had
the
shining
yellow
hair
i
ween
the
knights
forgot
their
words
or
else
they
ceased
to
care
for
he
who
wanted
purity
brought
home
a
wanton
wild
and
when
each
saw
the
other
knight
i
ween
that
each
knight
smiled
christmas
carol
the
kings
they
came
from
out
the
south
all
dressed
in
ermine
fine
they
bore
him
gold
and
chrysoprase
and
gifts
of
precious
wine
the
shepherds
came
from
out
the
north
their
coats
were
brown
and
old
they
brought
him
little
lambs
they
had
not
any
gold
the
came
from
out
the
east
and
they
were
wrapped
in
white
the
star
that
led
them
all
the
way
did
glorify
the
night
the
angels
came
from
heaven
high
and
they
were
clad
with
wings
and
lo
they
brought
a
joyful
song
the
host
of
heaven
sings
the
kings
they
knocked
upon
the
door
the
entered
in
the
shepherds
followed
after
them
to
hear
the
song
begin
and
mary
held
the
little
child
and
sat
upon
the
ground
she
looked
up
she
looked
down
she
looked
all
around
the
angels
sang
thro
all
the
night
until
the
rising
sun
but
little
jesus
fell
asleep
before
the
song
was
done
the
faery
forest
the
faery
forest
glimmered
beneath
an
ivory
moon
the
silver
grasses
shimmered
against
a
faery
tune
beneath
the
silken
silence
the
crystal
branches
slept
and
dreaming
thro
the
the
cold
white
blossoms
wept
a
fantasy
her
voice
is
like
clear
water
that
drips
upon
a
stone
in
forests
far
and
silent
where
quiet
plays
alone
her
thoughts
are
like
the
lotus
abloom
by
sacred
streams
beneath
the
temple
arches
where
quiet
sits
and
dreams
her
kisses
are
the
roses
that
glow
while
dusk
is
deep
in
persian
garden
closes
where
quiet
falls
asleep
a
minuet
of
across
the
dimly
lighted
room
the
violin
drew
wefts
of
sound
airily
they
wove
and
wound
and
glimmered
gold
against
the
gloom
i
watched
the
music
turn
to
light
but
at
the
pausing
of
the
bow
the
web
was
broken
and
the
glow
was
drowned
within
the
wave
of
night
twilight
dreamily
over
the
roofs
the
cold
spring
rain
is
falling
out
in
the
lonely
tree
a
bird
is
calling
calling
slowly
over
the
earth
the
wings
of
night
are
falling
my
heart
like
the
bird
in
the
tree
is
calling
calling
calling
the
prayer
my
answered
prayer
came
up
to
me
and
in
the
silence
thus
spake
he
o
you
who
prayed
for
me
to
come
your
greeting
is
but
cold
and
dumb
my
heart
made
answer
you
are
fair
but
i
have
prayed
too
long
to
care
why
came
you
not
when
all
was
new
and
i
had
died
for
joy
of
you
two
songs
for
a
child
i
grandfather
love
they
said
he
sent
his
love
to
me
they
would
put
it
in
my
hand
and
when
i
asked
them
where
it
was
they
said
i
could
understand
i
thought
they
must
have
hidden
it
i
hunted
for
it
all
the
day
and
when
i
told
them
so
at
night
they
smiled
and
turned
their
heads
away
they
say
that
love
is
something
kind
that
i
can
never
see
or
touch
i
wish
he
sent
me
something
else
i
like
his
twice
as
much
ii
the
kind
moon
i
think
the
moon
is
very
kind
to
take
such
trouble
just
for
me
he
came
along
with
me
from
home
to
keep
me
company
he
went
as
fast
as
i
could
run
i
wonder
how
he
crossed
the
sky
i
sure
he
has
legs
and
feet
or
any
wings
to
fly
yet
here
he
is
above
their
roof
perhaps
he
thinks
it
is
right
for
me
to
go
so
far
alone
tho
mother
said
i
might
on
the
tower

in
the
sun
i
fear
to
fall
the
knight
unseen
lean
on
me
love
my
love
and
look
not
down
call
me
not
love
call
me
your
conquered
foe
that
now
since
you
have
battered
down
her
gates
gives
you
the
keys
that
lock
the
highest
tower
and
mounts
with
you
to
prove
her
homage
true
oh
bid
me
go
no
farther
lest
i
fall
my
foot
has
slipped
upon
the
stones
why
are
the
stairs
so
narrow
and
so
steep
let
us
go
back
my
lord
are
you
afraid
who
were
so
dauntless
till
the
walls
gave
way
courage
my
sweet
i
would
that
i
could
climb
a
thousand
times
by
stairs
like
these
that
lead
so
near
to
heaven
sir
you
may
you
are
a
knight
and
very
valorous
i
am
a
woman
i
shall
never
come
this
way
but
once
the
knight
and
the
lady
appear
on
the
top
of
the
tower
kiss
me
at
last
my
love
oh
my
sweet
lord
i
am
too
tired
to
kiss
look
how
the
earth
is
like
an
emerald
with
rivers
veined
and
flawed
with
fallow
fields
lifting
her
veil
then
i
kiss
you
a
thousand
thousand
kisses
for
all
the
days
ere
i
had
won
to
you
beyond
the
walls
and
gates
you
barred
so
close
call
me
at
last
your
love
your
castle
lord
after
a
pause
i
love
you
she
kisses
him
her
veil
blows
away
like
a
white
butterfly
over
the
parapet
faint
cries
and
laughter
from
men
and
women
under
the
tower
men
and
women
the
veil
the
lady
veil
the
knight
takes
the
lady
in
his
arms
my
lord
i
pray
you
loose
me
from
your
arms
lest
that
my
people
see
how
much
we
love
may
they
not
see
us
all
of
them
have
loved
but
you
have
been
an
enemy
my
lord
with
walls
between
us
and
with
moats
now
on
a
sudden
must
i
kiss
your
mouth
i
who
was
taught
before
i
learned
to
speak
that
all
my
house
was
hostile
unto
yours
now
can
i
put
my
head
against
your
breast
here
in
the
sight
of
all
who
choose
to
come
are
we
not
past
the
caring
for
their
eyes
and
nearer
to
the
heaven
than
to
earth
look
up
and
see
i
only
see
your
face
she
touches
his
hair
with
her
hands
murmuring
under
the
tower
why
came
we
here
in
all
the
light
with
only
darting
swallows
over
us
to
make
a
speck
of
darkness
on
the
sun
let
us
go
down
where
walls
will
shut
us
round
your
castle
has
a
hundred
quiet
halls
a
hundred
chambers
where
the
shadows
lie
on
things
put
by
forgotten
long
ago
forgotten
lutes
with
strings
that
time
has
slackened
we
two
shall
draw
them
close
and
bid
them
sing
forgotten
games
forgotten
books
still
open
where
you
had
laid
them
by
at
and
your
embroidery
whereon
weeps
amor
wounded
by
a
rose
thorn
shall
i
not
see
the
room
in
which
you
slept
palpitant
still
and
breathing
of
your
thoughts
where
maiden
dreams
adown
the
ways
of
sleep
swept
noiselessly
with
damosels
and
knights
to
tourneys
where
the
trumpet
made
no
sound
blow
as
he
might
the
scarlet
trumpeter
and
were
the
dreams
not
sometimes
brimmed
with
tears
that
waked
you
when
the
night
was
loneliest
will
you
not
bring
me
to
your
oratory
where
prayers
arose
like
little
birds
set
free
still
upward
upward
without
sound
of
flight
shall
i
not
find
your
turrets
toward
the
north
where
you
defied
white
winter
armed
for
war
your
southern
casements
where
the
sun
blows
in
between
the
boughs
the
wind
has
lifted
shall
we
not
see
the
sunrise
toward
the
east
watch
dawn
by
dawn
the
rose
of
day
unfolding
its
beauty
sovereignly
and
toward
the
west
look
quietly
at
evening
shall
i
not
see
all
these
and
all
your
treasures
in
carven
coffers
hidden
in
the
dark
have
you
not
laid
a
sapphire
lit
with
flame
and
amethysts
set
round
with
gold
perhaps
a
ruby
all
my
gems
are
yours
and
all
my
chambers
curtained
from
the
sun
my
lord
shall
see
them
all
in
time
in
time
the
sun
begins
to
sink
shall
i
not
see
them
now
how
could
i
show
you
in
one
day
my
lord
my
castle
and
my
treasures
and
my
tower
let
all
the
days
to
come
suffice
for
this
since
all
the
past
days
made
them
what
they
are
you
will
not
be
impatient
my
sweet
lord
some
of
the
halls
have
long
been
locked
and
barred
and
some
have
secret
doors
and
hard
to
find
till
suddenly
you
touch
them
unawares
and
down
a
sable
way
runs
silver
light
we
two
will
search
together
for
the
keys
but
not
let
us
sit
here
since
all
is
yours
and
always
will
be
yours
the
stars
appear
faintly
one
by
one
after
a
pause
i
grow
a
little
drowsy
with
the
dusk
l
singing
there
was
a
man
that
loved
a
maid
sleep
and
take
your
rest
over
her
lips
his
kiss
was
laid
over
her
heart
his
breast
the
knight
sleeps
all
of
his
vows
were
sweet
to
hear
sweet
was
his
kiss
to
take
why
was
her
breast
so
quick
to
fear
why
was
her
heart
to
break
why
was
the
man
so
glad
to
woo
sleep
and
take
your
rest
why
were
the
maiden
words
so
few
she
sees
that
he
is
asleep
and
slipping
off
her
long
outer
garment
she
pillows
his
head
upon
it
against
the
parapet
and
half
kneeling
at
his
feet
she
sings
very
softly
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
am
the
flower
at
your
feet
the
birds
and
the
stars
are
above
you
my
place
is
more
sweet
the
birds
and
the
stars
are
above
you
they
envy
the
flower
in
the
grass
for
i
only
i
while
i
love
you
can
die
as
you
pass
light
clouds
veil
the
stars
growing
denser
constantly
the
castle
bell
rings
for
vespers
and
rising
the
lady
moves
to
a
corner
of
the
parapet
and
kneels
there

a
tourney
toward
your
enemy
has
challenged
you
my
lord
make
haste
to
come
the
knight
rises
and
gropes
his
way
toward
the
stairs
i
will
make
haste
await
me
where
you
are
to
himself
there
was
a
lady
on
this
tower
with
me
he
glances
around
hurriedly
but
does
not
see
her
in
the
darkness

my
lord
has
far
to
ride
before
the
dawn
to
himself
why
should
i
tarry
to
the
page
bring
my
horse
and
shield
he
descends
as
the
noise
of
his
footfall
on
the
stairs
dies
away
the
lady
gropes
toward
the
stairway

turns
suddenly

sara
teasdale
was
born
in
louis
missouri
where
she
attended
a
school
that
was
founded
by
the
grandfather
of
another
great
poet
from
louis
eliot
she
later
associated
herself
more
with
new
york
city
her
first
book
of
poems
was
sonnets
to
duse
but
helen
of
troy
was
the
true
launch
of
her
career
followed
by
rivers
to
the
sea
love
songs
flame
and
shadow
and
more
her
final
volume
strange
victory
is
considered
by
many
to
be
predictive
of
her
suicide
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
teasdale
collected
works
about
half
of
the
poems
in
this
volume
some
more
justly
than
others
have
been
excluded
and
most
of
the
rest
have
been
slightly
changed
most
of
the
poems
from
this
volume
which
were
selected
to
be
included
in
love
songs
also
had
some
minor
changes
this
edition
preserves
the
original
readings
but
they
are
not
to
be
considered
authoritative
