little
bit
of
a
woman
came
athwart
my
path
one
day
so
tiny
was
she
that
she
seemed
to
be
a
pixy
strayed
from
the
misty
sea
or
a
wandering
greenwood
oho
you
little
elf
i
cried
and
what
are
you
doing
here
so
tiny
as
you
will
never
do
for
the
brutal
rush
and
hullaballoo
of
this
practical
world
i
fear
voice
have
i
good
sir
said
is
soft
as
an
angel
sigh
but
to
fancy
a
word
of
yours
were
heard
in
all
the
din
of
this
world
absurd
smiling
i
made
hands
have
i
good
sir
she
marry
and
that
have
you
but
amid
the
strife
and
the
tumult
rife
in
all
the
struggle
and
battle
for
life
what
can
those
wee
hands
do
eyes
have
i
good
sir
she
sooth
you
have
quoth
i
and
tears
shall
flow
therefrom
i
trow
and
they
betimes
shall
dim
with
woe
as
the
hard
hard
years
go
by
little
bit
of
a
woman
cast
her
two
eyes
full
on
me
and
they
smote
me
sore
to
my
inmost
core
and
they
hold
me
slaved
forevermore
yet
would
i
not
be
free
little
bit
of
a
woman
hands
reached
up
into
my
breast
and
rent
apart
my
scoffing
heart
and
they
buffet
it
still
with
such
sweet
art
as
can
not
be
little
bit
of
a
woman
voice
hath
grown
most
wondrous
dear
above
the
blare
of
all
elsewhere
an
inspiration
that
mocks
at
care
it
riseth
full
and
one
i
bless
the
subtle
power
that
makes
me
wholly
thine
and
i
proud
to
say
that
i

father
way
my
father
was
no
pessimist
he
loved
the
things
of
earth
its
cheerfulness
and
sunshine
its
music
and
its
mirth
he
never
sighed
or
moped
around
whenever
things
went
wrong
i
warrant
me
he
mocked
at
fate
with
some
defiant
song
but
being
he
war
much
on
tune
when
times
looked
sort
o
blue
he
whistle
softly
to
himself
this
only
tune
he
knew
illustration
music
now
mother
when
she
heard
that
tune
which
father
whistled
so
would
say
there
something
wrong
with
ephraim
i
know
he
never
tries
to
make
believe
he
happy
that
way
but
that
i
certain
as
can
be
there
somethin
wrong
to
pay
and
so
betimes
quite
to
us
observant
youth
there
seemed
suggestion
in
that
tune
of
deep
pathetic
truth
when
brother
william
joined
the
war
a
lot
of
us
went
down
to
see
the
gallant
soldier
boys
right
gayly
out
of
town
home
poor
mother
cried
as
if
her
heart
would
break
and
all
us
children
too
for
and
for
sake
but
father
trudgin
on
ahead
his
hands
behind
him
so
kept
whistlin
to
himself
so
sort
of
and
low
and
when
my
oldest
sister
sue
was
married
and
went
west
seemed
like
it
took
the
tuck
right
out
of
mother
and
the
rest
she
was
the
sunlight
in
our
home
why
father
used
to
say
it
would
seem
like
home
at
all
if
sue
should
go
away
but
when
she
went
us
all
sorrer
and
all
tears
poor
father
whistled
and
went
to
feed
the
steers
when
crops
were
bad
and
other
ills
befell
our
homely
lot
he
set
of
nights
and
try
to
act
as
if
he
minded
not
and
when
came
death
and
bore
away
the
one
he
worshipped
so
how
vainly
did
his
lips
belie
the
heart
benumbed
with
woe
you
see
the
telltale
whistle
told
a
mood
he
not
admit
he
always
stopped
his
whistlin
when
he
thought
we
noticed
it
i
like
to
see
that
stooping
form
and
hoary
head
again
to
see
the
honest
hearty
smile
that
cheered
his
oh
could
i
kiss
the
kindly
lips
that
spake
no
creature
wrong
and
share
the
rapture
of
the
heart
that
overflowed
with
song
oh
could
i
hear
the
little
tune
he
whistled
long
ago
when
he
did
battle
with
the
griefs
he
would
not
have
know
to
my
mother
how
fair
you
are
my
mother
ah
though
is
many
a
year
since
you
were
here
still
do
i
see
your
beauteous
face
and
with
the
glow
of
your
dark
eyes
cometh
a
grace
of
long
ago
so
gentle
too
my
mother
just
as
of
old
upon
my
brow
like
benedictions
now
falleth
your
dear
hand
touch
and
still
as
then
a
voice
that
glads
me
cometh
again
my
fair
and
gentle
mother
how
you
have
loved
me
mother
i
have
not
power
to
tell
knowing
full
well
that
even
in
the
rest
above
it
is
your
will
to
watch
and
guard
me
with
your
love
loving
me
still
and
as
of
old
my
mother
i
am
content
to
be
a
child
by
mother
love
beguiled
from
all
these
other
charms
so
to
the
last
within
thy
dear
protecting

thou
me

gosling
stew
in
oberhausen
on
a
time
i
fared
as
might
a
king
and
now
i
feel
the
muse
sublime
inspire
me
to
embalm
in
rhyme
that
succulent
and
sapid
thing
behight
of
gentile
and
of
jew
a
gosling
stew
the
good
herr
schmitz
brought
out
his
best
soup
cutlet
salad
roast
and
i
partook
with
hearty
zest
and
fervently
anon
i
blessed
that
generous
and
benignant
host
when
suddenly
dawned
on
my
view
a
gosling
stew
i
sniffed
it
coming
on
apace
and
as
its
odors
filled
the
curious
little
i
felt
a
glow
suffuse
my
face
i
felt
my
very
marrow
thrilled
with
rapture
altogether
new
was
gosling
stew
these
callow
birds
had
never
played
in
yonder
village
pond
had
never
through
the
gateway
strayed
and
plaintive
spissant
music
made
upon
the
grassy
green
beyond
cooped
up
they
simply
ate
and
grew
for
gosling
stew
my
doctor
said
i
must
eat
high
food
and
seasoned
game
but
surely
gosling
is
a
meat
with
tender
nourishment
replete
leastwise
i
gayly
ate
this
same
i
braved
dyspepsy
would
you
for
gosling
stew
i
feasted
where
the
possums
grow
roast
turkey
have
i
tried
the
joys
of
canvasbacks
i
know
and
frequently
i
eaten
crow
in
bleak
and
chill
novembertide
i
barter
all
that
native
crew
for
gosling
stew
and
when
from
rhineland
i
adjourn
to
seek
my
yankee
shore
back
shall
my
memory
often
turn
and
fiercely
shall
my
palate
burn
for
sweets
i
taste
alas
no
more
oh
that
mein
kleine
frau
could
brew
a
gosling
stew
vain
are
these
keen
regrets
of
mine
and
vain
the
song
i
sing
yet
would
i
quaff
a
stoup
of
wine
to
oberhausen
auf
der
rhine
where
fared
i
like
a
very
king
and
here
a
last
and
fond
adieu
to
gosling
stew
catullus
to
lesbia
come
my
lesbia
no
repining
let
us
love
while
yet
we
may
suns
go
on
forever
shining
but
when
we
have
had
our
day
sleep
perpetual
shall
us
and
no
morrow
dawn
awake
us
come
in
yonder
nook
reclining
where
the
honeysuckle
climbs
let
us
mock
at
fate
designing
let
us
kiss
a
thousand
times
and
if
they
shall
prove
too
few
dear
when
they
kissed
we
start
anew
dear
and
should
any
chance
to
see
us
goodness
how
they
agonize
how
they
wish
that
they
could
be
us
kissing
in
such
liberal
wise
never
mind
their
envious
whining
come
my
lesbia
no
repining
john
smith
i
strayed
in
charing
cross
as
wretched
as
could
be
with
thinking
of
my
home
and
friends
across
the
tumbling
sea
there
was
no
water
in
my
eyes
but
my
spirits
were
depressed
and
my
heart
lay
like
a
sodden
soggy
doughnut
in
my
breast
this
way
and
that
streamed
multitudes
that
gayly
passed
me
by
not
one
in
all
the
crowd
knew
me
and
not
a
one
knew
i
oh
for
a
touch
of
home
i
sighed
oh
for
a
friendly
face
oh
for
a
hearty
in
this
teeming
desert
place
and
so
soliloquizing
as
a
homesick
creature
will
incontinent
i
wandered
down
the
noisy
bustling
hill
and
drifted
and
vaguely
into
lowe
where
fortune
had
in
store
a
panacea
for
my
woes
the
register
was
open
and
there
dawned
upon
my
sight
a
name
that
filled
and
thrilled
me
with
a
cyclone
of
delight
the
name
that
i
shall
venerate
unto
my
dying
day
the
proud
immortal
signature
john
smith
s
a
wildly
i
clutched
the
register
and
brooded
on
that
name
i
knew
john
smith
yet
could
not
well
identify
the
same
i
knew
him
north
i
knew
him
south
i
knew
him
east
and
west
i
knew
him
all
so
well
i
knew
not
which
i
knew
the
best
his
eyes
i
recollect
were
gray
and
black
and
brown
and
blue
and
when
he
was
not
bald
his
hair
was
of
chameleon
hue
lean
fat
tall
short
rich
poor
grave
gay
a
blonde
and
a
brunette
aha
amid
this
london
fog
john
smith
i
see
you
yet
i
see
you
yet
and
yet
the
sight
is
all
so
blurred
i
seem
to
see
you
in
composite
or
as
in
a
waking
dream
which
are
you
john
i
like
to
know
that
i
might
weave
a
rhyme
appropriate
to
your
character
your
politics
and
clime
so
tell
me
were
you
raised
or
reared
your
pedigree
confess
in
some
such
treacherous
ism
as
i
reckon
or
i
guess
let
fall
your
telltale
dialect
that
instantly
i
may
identify
my
countryman
john
smith
s
a
it
like
as
not
you
air
the
john
that
lived
aspell
ago
deown
east
where
codfish
beans
grow
where
the
dear
old
homestead
nestles
like
among
the
hampshire
hills
and
where
the
robin
hops
about
the
trills
where
hubbard
squash
huckleberries
grow
to
powerful
size
and
everything
is
orthodox
from
preachers
down
to
pies
where
the
blackbirds
swing
call
beside
the
pickril
pond
and
the
crows
air
cawin
in
the
pines
uv
the
pasture
lot
beyond
where
folks
complain
uv
bein
poor
because
their
money
lent
out
west
on
farms
railroads
at
the
rate
uv
ten
per
cent
where
we
ust
to
spark
the
baker
girls
home
from
choir
or
namin
apples
round
the
roarin
kitchen
fire
where
we
had
to
go
to
meetin
at
least
three
times
a
week
and
our
mothers
learnt
us
good
religious
watts
to
speak
and
where
our
grandmas
sleep
their
sleep
god
rest
their
souls
i

whar

blue
whar
a
niggah
with

the
signal
fo

fight
whar
the
yaller
dawg
pursues

coon
throughout
the

blooms
the
furtive
possum
pride
an
glory
of

a
sah
that

the
ashes
of

clay
lookin
at
yo
john

s
a
or
wuz
you
that
john
smith
i
knew
out
yonder
in
the
west
that
part
of
our
republic
i
shall
always
love
the
best
wuz
you
him
that
went
prospectin
in
the
spring
of
in
the
red
hoss
mountain
country
for
the
mine
oh
how
i
liked
to
clasped
your
hand
an
set
down
by
your
side
and
talked
about
the
good
old
days
beyond
the
big
divide
of
the
rackaboar
the
snaix
the
bear
the
rocky
mountain
goat
of
the
conversazzhyony
of
casey
and
a
word
of
them
old
pardners
that
stood
by
us
long
ago
hoover
sorry
tom
and
parson
jim
you
know
old
times
old
friends
john
smith
would
make
our
hearts
beat
high
again
and
we
see
the
mountains
like
we
used
to
see
then
the
magpies
would
go
flutterin
like
strange
sperrits
to
fro
and
we
hear
the
pines
in
the
ragged
gulch
below
and
the
mountain
brook
would
loiter
like
upon
its
windin
way
ez
if
it
waited
for
a
child
to
jine
it
in
its
play
you
see
john
smith
just
which
you
are
i
can
not
well
recall
and
really
i
am
pleased
to
think
you
somehow
must
be
all
for
when
a
man
sojourns
abroad
awhile
as
i
have
done
he
likes
to
think
of
all
the
folks
he
left
at
home
as
one
and
so
they
are
for
well
you
know
there
nothing
in
a

martin
lane
winds
up
the
hill
and
trends
a
devious
way
i
walk
therein
amid
the
din
of
busy
london
day
i
walk
where
wealth
and
squalor
meet
and
think
upon
a
time
when
others
trod
this
saintly
sod
and
heard
martin
chime
but
when
those
solemn
bells
invoke
the
midnight
slumbrous
grace
the
ghosts
of
men
come
back
again
to
haunt
that
curious
place
the
ghosts
of
sages
poets
wits
come
back
in
goodly
train
and
all
night
long
with
mirth
and
song
they
walk
martin

with

here
and
there
and
everywhere
fraserians
by

score
and
one
wee
ghost
that
climbs
the
hill
is
welcomed
with
a
shout
no
king
could
be
revered
as
he
the
father
prout
they
banter
up
and
down
the
street
and
clamor
at
the
door
of
yonder
inn
which
once
has
been
the
scene
of
mirth
galore
is
now
a
lonely
musty
shell
deserted
like
to
fall
and
echo
mocks
their
ghostly
knocks
and
iterates
their
call
come
back
thou
ghost
of
ruddy
host
from
pluto
misty
shore
renew
the
keen
delight
of
years
once
more
brew
for
this
merry
motley
horde
and
serve
the
steaming
cheer
and
grant
that
i
may
lurk
hard
by
to
see
the
mirth
and
hear
ah
me
i
dream
what
things
may
seem
to
others
childish
vain
and
yet
at
night
is
my
delight
to
walk
martin
lane
for
in
the
light
of
other
days
i
walk
with
those
i
love
and
all
the
time
martin
chime
makes
piteous
moan
above
the
singing
in
god
acre
out
yonder
in
the
moonlight
wherein
god
acre
lies
go
angels
walking
to
and
fro
singing
their
lullabies
their
radiant
wings
are
folded
and
their
eyes
are
bended
low
as
they
sing
among
the
beds
whereon
the
flowers
delight
to
grow
sleep
oh
sleep
the
shepherd
guardeth
his
sheep
fast
speedeth
the
night
away
soon
cometh
the
glorious
day
sleep
weary
ones
while
ye
may
sleep
oh
sleep
the
flowers
within
god
acre
see
that
fair
and
wondrous
sight
and
hear
the
angels
singing
to
the
sleepers
through
the
night
and
lo
throughout
the
hours
of
day
those
gentle
flowers
prolong
the
music
of
the
angels
in
that
tender
sleep
oh
sleep
the
shepherd
loveth
his
sheep
he
that
guardeth
his
flock
the
best
hath
folded
them
to
his
loving
breast
so
sleep
ye
now
and
take
your
rest
sleep
oh
sleep
from
angel
and
from
flower
the
years
have
learned
that
soothing
song
and
with
its
heavenly
music
speed
the
days
and
nights
along
so
through
all
time
whose
flight
the
shepherd
vigils
glorify
god
acre
slumbereth
in

grace
of
that
sweet
lullaby

dear
old
london
when
i
was
broke
in
london
in
the
fall
of
i
chanced
to
spy
in
oxford
street
this
tantalizing
sign
a
splendid
horace
cheap
for
cash
of
course
i
had
to
look
upon
the
vaunted
bargain
and
it
was
a
noble
book
a
finer
one
i
never
seen
nor
can
i
hope
to
see
the
first
edition
richly
bound
and
clean
as
clean
can
be
and
just
to
think
for
i
might
have
had
that
pine
when
i
was
broke
in
london
in
the
fall
of
down
at
noseda
in
the
strand
i
found
one
fateful
day
a
portrait
that
i
pined
for
as
only
maniac
may
a
print
of
madame
vestris
she
flourished
years
ago
was
bartolozzi
daughter
and
a
thoroughbred
you
know
a
clean
and
handsome
print
it
was
and
cheap
at
thirty
bob
that
what
i
told
the
salesman
as
i
choked
a
rising
sob
but
i
hung
around
noseda
as
it
were
a
holy
shrine
when
i
was
broke
in
london
in
the
fall
of
at
davey
in
great
russell
street
were
autographs
galore
and
davey
used
to
let
me
con
that
precious
store
sometimes
i
read
what
warriors
wrote
sometimes
a
king
command
but
oftener
still
a
poet
verse
writ
in
a
meagre
hand
lamb
byron
addison
and
burns
pope
johnson
swift
and
scott
it
needed
but
a
paltry
sum
to
comprehend
the
lot
yet
though
friend
davey
marked
down
what
could
i
but
decline
for
i
was
broke
in
london
in
the
fall
of
of
antique
swords
and
spears
i
saw
a
vast
and
dazzling
heap
that
curio
fenton
offered
me
at
prices
passing
cheap
and
oh
the
quaint
old
bureaus
and
the
of
brass
and
the
lovely
hideous
freaks
i
found
in
pewter
and
in
glass
and
oh
the
sideboards
candlesticks
the
cracked
old
china
plates
the
clocks
and
spoons
from
amsterdam
that
antedate
all
dates
of
such
superb
monstrosities
i
found
an
endless
mine
when
i
was
broke
in
london
in
the
fall
of
o
ye
that
hanker
after
boons
that
others
idle
by
the
battered
things
that
please
the
soul
though
they
may
vex
the
eye
the
silver
plate
and
crockery
all
sanctified
with
grime
the
oaken
stuff
that
has
defied
the
tooth
of
envious
time
the
musty
tomes
the
speckled
prints
the
mildewed
bills
of
play
and
other
costly
relics
of
malodorous
decay
ye
only
can
appreciate
what
agony
was
mine
when
i
was
broke
in
london
in
the
fall
of

in
the
course

natural

my
reward

in
hebrew
latin

nor
any
classic
tongue
let
my
ten
thousand
triumphs
over
human
griefs
be
sung
but
in
plain

may
know
who
seeks
what
agonizing
pangs
i

on

dote
on

tone
than
ever
the
harp
has
uttered
or
ever
the
lute
has
known
when
i
wake
at
five
in
the
morning
with
a
feeling
in
my
head
suggestive
of
mild
excesses
before
i
retired
to
bed
when
a
small
but
fierce
volcano
vexes
me
sore
inside
and
my
throat
and
mouth
are
furred
with
a
fur
that
seemeth
a
buffalo
hide
how
gracious
those
dews
of
solace
that
over
my
senses
fall
at
the
clink
of
the
ice
in
the
pitcher
the
boy
brings
up
the
hall
oh
is
it
the
gaudy
ballet
with
features
i
can
not
name
that
kindles
in
virile
bosoms
that
slow
but
devouring
flame
or
is
it
the
midnight
supper
eaten
before
we
retire
that
presently
by
combustion
setteth
us
all
afire
or
is
it
the
cheery
magnum
nay
i
not
chide
the
cup
that
makes
the
meekest
mortal
anxious
to
whoop
things
up
yet
what
the
cause
soever
relief
comes
when
we
call
relief
with
that
rapturous
that
clinketh
alike
for
all
i
dreamt
of
the
fiery
furnace
that
was
one
vast
bulk
of
flame
and
that
i
was
abednego
in
that
same
and
i
dreamt
i
was
a
crater
possessed
of
a
mad
desire
to
vomit
molten
lava
and
to
snort
big
gobs
of
fire
i
dreamt
i
was
roman
candles
and
rockets
that
fizzed
and
screamed
in
short
i
have
dreamt
the
cussedest
dreams
that
ever
a
human
dreamed
but
all
the
fancies
were
scattered
quick
as
a
wink
when
the
spirit
within
that
pitcher
went
clinking
its
boy
why
so
slow
in
coming
with
that
gracious
saving
cup
oh
haste
thee
to
the
succor
of
the
man
who
is
burning
up
see
how
the
ice
bobs
up
and
down
as
if
it
wildly
strove
to
reach
its
grace
to
the
wretch
who
feels
like
a
kitchen
stove
the
piteous
clinks
it
clinks
methinks
should
thrill
you
through
and
through
an
erring
soul
is
wanting
drink
and
he
wants
it
and
lo
the
honest
pitcher
too
falls
in
so
dire
a
fret
that
its
pallid
form
is
presently
bedewed
with
a
chilly
sweat
may
blessings
be
showered
upon
the
man
who
first
devised
this
drink
that
happens
along
at
five
with
its
rapturous
i
never
have
felt
the
cooling
flood
go
sizzling
down
my
throat
but
what
i
vowed
to
hymn
a
hymn
to
that
devote
so
now
in
the
prime
of
my
manhood
i
polish
this
lyric
gem
for
the
uses
of
all
good
fellows
who
are
thirsty
at
five
but
specially
for
those
fellows
who
have
known
the
pleasing
thrall
of
the
clink
of
the
ice
in
the
pitcher
the
boy
brings
up
the
hall
the
bells
of
notre
dame
what
though
the
radiant
thoroughfare
teems
with
a
noisy
throng
what
though
men
bandy
everywhere
the
ribald
jest
and
song
over
the
din
of
oaths
and
cries
broodeth
a
wondrous
calm
and
mid
that
solemn
stillness
rise
the
bells
of
notre
dame
heed
not
dear
lord
they
seem
to
say
thy
weak
and
erring
child
and
thou
o
gentle
mother
pray
that
god
be
reconciled
and
on
mankind
o
christ
our
king
pour
out
thy
gracious
balm
is
thus
they
plead
and
thus
they
sing
those
bells
of
notre
dame
and
so
methinks
god
bending
down
to
ken
the
things
of
earth
heeds
not
the
mockery
of
the
town
or
cries
of
ribald
mirth
for
ever
soundeth
in
his
ears
a
penitential
psalm
is
thy
angelic
voice
he
hears
o
bells
of
notre
dame
plead
on
o
bells
that
thy
sweet
voice
may
still
forever
be
an
intercession
to
rejoice
benign
divinity
and
that
thy
tuneful
grace
may
fall
like
dew
a
quickening

us
sit
awhile
beloved

dream
of
the
good
old
days
of
the
kindly

made
round
the
stanch
but
squeaky
chaise
with
your

crumpets
and
tea
there
are
happenings
in
life
that
are
destined
to
rise
like
dear
hallowed
visions
before
a
man
eyes
and
the
passage
of
years
shall
not
dim
in
the
least
the
glory
and
joy
of
our
feast
the
luncheon
that
spread
for
us
three
my
worthy
companions
teresa
and
leigh
and
me
all
so
hungry
for
crumpets
and
tea
there
are
cynics
who
say
with
invidious
zest
that
a
crumpet
a
thing
that
will
never
digest
but
i
happen
to
that
a
crumpet
is
prime
for
digestion
if
only
you
give
it
its
time
or
if
by
a
chance
it
should
quite
agree
why
who
would
begrudge
a
physician
his
fee
for
plying
his
trade
upon
crumpets
and
tea
to
toast
crumpets
quite
la
i
require
a
proper
long
fork
and
a
proper
quick
fire
and
when
they
are
browned
without
further
ado
i
put
on
the
butter
that
soaks
through
and
through
and
meantime
teresa
directed
by
leigh
compounds
and
pours
out
a
rich
brew
for
us
three
and
so
we
sit
down
to
our
crumpets
and
tea
a
grinds
in
the
street
a
weird
bit
confound
those
italians
i
wish
they
would
quit
interrupting
our
feast
with
their
dolorous
airs
suggestive
of
climbing
the
heavenly
stairs
it
thoughts
of
the
future
as
all
will
agree
that
we
fain
would
dismiss
from
our
bosoms
when
we
sit
down
to
discussion
of
crumpets
and
tea
the
luncheon
whereof
i
now
speak
quite
answers
its
purpose
the
rest
of
the
week
yet
with
the
next
sabbath
i
wait
for
the
bell
announcing
the
man
who
has
crumpets
to
sell
then
i
scuttle
downstairs
in
a
frenzy
of
glee
and
purchase
for
sixpence
enough
for
us
three
who
hunger
and
hanker
for
crumpets
and
tea
but
soon
ah
too
soon
i
must
bid
a
farewell
to
joys
that
succeed
to
the
sound
of
that
bell
must
hie
me
away
from
the
dank
foggy
shore
that
filled
me
with
colic
and
yearnings
for
more
then
the
cruel
the
heartless
the
conscienceless
sea
shall
bear
me
afar
from
teresa
and
leigh
and
the
other
twin
friendships
of
crumpets
and
tea
yet
often
ay
ever
before
my
wan
eyes
that
luncheon
of
old
shall
arise
my
stomach
perhaps
shall
improve
by
the
change
since
crumpets
it
seems
to
prefer
at
long
range
but
oh
how
my
palate
will
hanker
to
be
in
london
again
with
teresa
and
leigh
enjoying
the
rapture
of
crumpets
and
tea
an
imitation
of
watts
through
all
my
life
the
poor
shall
find
in
me
a
constant
friend
and
on
the
meek
of
every
kind
my
mercy
shall
attend
the
dumb
shall
never
call
on
me
in
vain
for
kindly
aid
and
in
my
hands
the
blind
shall
see
a
bounteous
alms
displayed
in
all
their
walks
the
lame
shall
know
and
feel
my
goodness
near
and
on
the
deaf
will
i
bestow
my
gentlest
words
of
cheer
is
by
such
pious
works
as
these
which
i
delight
to
do
that
men
their
please
and
please
their
maker
too
willie
and
bess
georgie
and
may
once
as
these
children
were
hard
at
play
an
old
man
hoary
and
tottering
came
and
watched
them
playing
their
pretty
game
he
seemed
to
wonder
while
standing
there
what
the
meaning
thereof
could
be
aha
but
the
old
man
yearned
to
share
of
the
little
children
innocent
glee
as
they
circled
around
with
laugh
and
shout
and
told
this
rhyme
at
counting
out
and
wire
brier
limber
lock
twelve
geese
in
a
flock
some
flew
east
some
flew
west
some
flew
over
the
cuckoo
nest
willie
and
bess
georgie
and
may
ah
the
mirth
of
that
summer
day
was
father
time
who
had
come
to
share
the
innocent
joy
of
those
children
there
he
learned
betimes
the
game
they
played
and
into
their
sport
with
them
went
he
how
the
children
have
been
afraid
since
little
they
recked
who
he
might
be
they
laughed
to
hear
old
father
time
mumbling
that
curious
nonsense
rhyme
of
and
wire
brier
limber
lock
twelve
geese
in
a
flock
some
flew
east
some
flew
west
some
flew
over
the
cuckoo
nest
willie
and
bess
georgie
and
may
and
joy
of
summer
where
are
they
the
grim
old
man
still
standeth
near
crooning
the
song
of
a
year
and
into
the
winter
i
come
alone
cheered
by
that
mournful
requiem
soothed
by
the
dolorous
monotone
that
shall
count
me
off
as
it
counted
them
the
solemn
voice
of
old
father
time
chanting
the
homely
nursery
rhyme
he
learned
of
the
children
a
summer
morn
when
with
and
life
was
full
of
the
dulcet
cheer
that
bringeth
the
grace
of
heaven
anear
the
sound
of
the
little
ones
hard
at
play
willie
and
bess
georgie

perhaps
but
good
ez

and
true
ez

and
you
never

squeal
good
to

helpless
and
the
weak
a
brave
an

heart
a
cyclone
could
phase
but
any
child
could
rend

so
like
the
mountain
pine
that
dares
the
storm
wich
sweeps
along
but
rocks
the
winds
uv
an
sings
a
soothin
song
telling
the
bees
out
of
the
house
where
the
slumberer
lay
grandfather
came
one
summer
day
and
under
the
pleasant
orchard
trees
he
spake
this
wise
to
the
murmuring
bees
the
that
kissed
her
feet
and
the
where
she
used
to
play
have
honey
store
but
none
so
sweet
as
ere
our
little
one
went
away
o
bees
sing
soft
and
bees
sing
low
for
she
is
gone
who
loved
you
so
a
wonder
fell
on
the
listening
bees
under
those
pleasant
orchard
trees
and
in
their
toil
that
summer
day
ever
their
murmuring
seemed
to
say
child
o
child
the
grass
is
cool
and
the
posies
are
waking
to
hear
the
song
of
the
bird
that
swings
by
the
shaded
pool
waiting
for
one
that
tarrieth
long
was
so
they
called
to
the
little
one
then
as
if
to
call
her
back
again
o
gentle
bees
i
have
come
to
say
that
grandfather
fell
asleep
and
we
know
by
the
smile
on
grandfather
face
he
has
found
his
dear
one
so
bees
sing
soft
and
bees
sing
low
as
over
the
you
sweep
to
the
trees
abloom
and
the
flowers
ablow
sing
of
grandfather
fast
asleep
and
ever
beneath
these
orchard
trees
find
cheer
and
shelter
gentle
bees
the
my
lady
has
a
that
is
wondrous
fair
to
see
it
is
flounced
and
ruffed
and
plaited
and
puffed
as
a
ought
to
be
and
i
thought
she
must
be
jesting
last
night
at
supper
when
she
remarked
by
chance
that
it
came
from
france
and
had
cost
but
two
pounds
ten
had
she
told
me
fifty
shillings
i
might
and
would
you
have
referred
to
that
dress
in
a
way
folks
express
by
an
eloquent
dash
or
two
but
the
guileful
little
creature
knew
well
her
tactics
when
she
casually
said
that
that
dream
in
red
had
cost
but
two
pounds
ten
yet
our
home
is
all
the
brighter
for
that
dainty
sensient
thing
that
floats
away
where
it
properly
may
and
clings
where
it
ought
to
cling
and
i
count
myself
the
luckiest
of
all
us
married
men
that
i
have
a
wife
whose
joy
in
life
is
a
gown
at
two
pounds
ten
it
is
the
gown
compels
me
condone
this
venial
sin
it
the
pretty
face
above
the
lace
and
the
gentle
heart
within
and
with
her
arms
about
me
i
say
and
say
again
was
wondrous
cheap
and
i
think
a
heap
of
that
gown
at
two
pounds
ten
doctors
is
quite
the
thing
to
say
and
sing
gross
libels
on
the
doctor
to
picture
him
an
ogre
grim
or
concocter
yet
it
in
quite
another
light
my
friendly
pen
would
show
him
glad
that
it
may
with
verse
repay
some
part
of
what
i
owe
him
when
one
all
right
he
prone
to
spite
the
doctor
peaceful
mission
but
when
he
sick
it
loud
and
quick
he
bawls
for
a
physician
with
other
things
the
doctor
brings
sweet
babes
our
hearts
to
soften
though
i
have
four
i
pine
for
more
good
doctor
pray
come
often
what
though
he
sees
death
and
disease
run
riot
all
around
him
patient
and
true
and
valorous
too
such
have
i
always
found
him
he
goes
he
soothes
our
woes
and
when
skill
unavailing
and
death
is
near
his
words
of
cheer
support
our
courage
failing
in
ancient
days
they
used
to
praise
the
godlike
art
of
healing
an
art
that
then
engaged
all
men
possessed
of
sense
and
feeling
why
raleigh
he
was
glad
to
be
famed
for
a
quack

we
are
told

lovesick
sir
napoleon
knew
a
thing
or
two
and
clearly
was
partial
to
doctors
for
in

he
chose
one
for
a
marshal
in
our
great
cause
a
doctor
was
the
first
to
pass
death
portal
and
warren
name
at
once
became
a
beacon
and
immortal
a
heap
indeed
of
what
we

provided
for
to
those

old
friend
well
then
here
goes
my
blessing
barbara
blithe
was
the
youth
that
summer
day
as
he
smote
at
the
ribs
of
earth
and
he
plied
his
pick
with
a
merry
click
and
he
whistled
anon
in
mirth
and
the
constant
thought
of
his
dear
one
face
seemed
to
illumine
that
ghostly
place
the
gaunt
earth
envied
the
lover
joy
and
she
moved
and
closed
on
his
head
with
no
one
nigh
and
with
never
a
cry
the
beautiful
boy
lay
dead
and
the
treasure
he
sought
for
his
sweetheart
fair
crumbled
and
clung
to
his
glorious
hair
fifty
years
is
a
mighty
space
in
the
human
toil
for
bread
but
to
love
and
to
death
is
merely
a
breath
a
dream
that
is
quickly
sped
fifty
years
and
the
fair
lad
lay
just
as
he
fell
that
summer
day
at
last
came
others
in
quest
of
gold
and
hewed
in
that
mountain
place
and
deep
in
the
ground
one
time
they
found
the
boy
with
the
smiling
face
all
uncorrupt
by
the
pitiless
air
he
lay
with
his
crown
of
golden
hair
they
bore
him
up
to
the
sun
again
and
laid
him
beside
the
brook
and
the
folk
came
down
from
the
busy
town
to
wonder

the
boy
came
back
to
the
spot
old
barbara
hobbled
among
the
rest
wrinkled
and
bowed
was
she
and
she
gave
a
cry
as
she
fared
anigh
at
last
he
is
come
to
me
and
she
kneeled
by
the
side
of
the
dead
boy
there
and
she
kissed
his
lips
and
she
stroked
his
hair

eyes

sealed

barbara
bowed
her
aged
face
and
fell
on
the
breast
of
her
dead
and
the
golden
hair
of
her
dear
one
there
caressed
her
head
oh
life
is
sweet
with
its
touch
of
pain
but
sweeter
the
death
that
joined
those
twain
the
café
molineau
the
café
molineau
is
where
a
dainty
little
minx
serves
god
and
man
as
best
she
can
by
serving
meats
and
drinks
oh
such
an
air
the
creature
has
and
such
a
pretty
face
i
took
delight
that
autumn
night
in
hanging
round
the
place
i
know
but
very
little
french
i
have
not
long
been
here
but
when
she
spoke
her
meaning
broke
full
sweetly
on
my
ear
then
too
she
seemed
to
understand
whatever
i
to
say
though
most
i
knew
was
oony
poo
bong
zhoor
and
see
voo
play
the
female
wit
is
always
quick
and
of
all
womankind
is
here
in
france
that
you
perchance
the
keenest
wits
shall
find
and
here
you
find
that
subtle
gift
that
rare
distinctive
touch
combined
with
grace
of
form
and
face
that
glads
men
overmuch
our
girls
at
home
i
mused
aloud
lack
either
that
or
this
they
do
combine
the
arts
divine
as
does
the
gallic
miss
far
be
it
from
me
to
malign
our
belles
across
the
sea
and
yet
i
swear
none
can
compare
with
this
ideal
she
and
then
i
praised
her
dainty
foot
in
very
awful
french
and
parleyvood
in
guileful
mood
until
the
saucy
wench
tossed
back
her
haughty
auburn
head
and
froze
me
with
disdain
there
are
on
me
no
flies
said
she
for

of

that
outpoureth
from
above
the
boltons
when
winter
nights
are
grewsome
and
the
heavy
yellow
fog
gives
to
piccadilly
semblance
of
a
dank
malarious
bog
when
a
demon
with
companion
in
similitude
of
bell
goes
round
informing
people
he
has
crumpets
for
to
sell
when
a
weird
asthmatic
minstrel
haunts
your
door
for
hours
along
until
you
paid
him
for
the
thing
he
calls
a
song
when
in
short
the
world
against
you
and
you
give
that
world
and
more
to
lay
your
weary
heart
at
rest
upon
your
native
shore
there
happily
one
saving
thing
for
you
and
yours
to
do
go
call
on
isaac
henderson
the
boltons
the
place
is
all
so
cheery
and
so
warm
i
love
to
spend
my
evenings
in
communion
with
the
genial
host
my
friend
one
sees
of
masters
in
profusion
on
the
walls
and
a
monster
canine
swaggers
up
and
down
the
spacious
halls
there
are
divers
things
of
beauty
to
astound
instruct
and
please
and
everywhere
assurance
of
contentment
and
of
ease
but
best
of
all
the
gentle
hearts
i
meet
with
in
the
place
the
host
his
wife
sincere
and
modest
grace
why
if
there
be
cordiality
that
warms
you
through
and
through
it
found
at
isaac
henderson
the
boltons
my
favorite
room
the
study
that
is
on
the
second
floor
and
there
we
sit
in
judgment
on
men
and
things
galore
the
fire
burns
briskly
in
the
grate
and
sheds
a
genial
glare
on
me
who
most
discreetly
have
isaac
chair
a
big
low
chair
with
grateful
springs
and
curious
device
to
keep
a
fellow
cerebellum
and
nice
a
shade
obscures
the
functions
of
the
stately
lamp
in
spite
of
henderson
demands
for
somewhat
more
of
light
but
he
and
i
demur
and
say
a
mystic
gloom
will
do
for
communion
at
the
boltons
sometimes
he
reads
me
browning
or
from
bryant
culls
a
bit
and
sometimes
plucks
a
gem
from
hood
philosophy
and
wit
and
oftentimes
i
tell
him
yarns
and
what
i
fear
is
worse
recite
him
sundry
specimens
of
woolly
western
verse
and
while
his
muse
and
mine
transcend
the
bright
horatian
stars
he
smokes
his
modest
pipe
and
i
i
smoke
his
choice
cigars
for
best
of
mild
havanas
this
considerate
host
supplies
the
proper
brand
the
proper
shade
and
quite
the
proper
size
and
so
i
buckle
down
and
smoke
and
smoke
and
so
will
you
if
ever
you
invited
to
the
boltons
but
oh
the
best
of
worldly
joys
is
as
a
dream
is
twelve
and
robinson
reports
our
cab
arrived
a
last
libation
ere
we
part
and
hands
all
round
and
then
a
cordial
invitation
to
us
both
to
come
again
so
home
through
piccadilly
and
through
oxford
street
we
jog
on
slippery
noisy
pavements
and
in
blinding
choking
fog
the
same
old
route
through
circus
square
and
quadrant
we
retrace
till
we
reach
the
princely
mansion
known
as
alfred
place
and
then
we
seek
our
feathery
beds
of
cotton
to
renew
in
dreams
the
sweet
distractions
of
the
boltons
god
bless
you
good
friend
isaac
and
your
lovely
gracious
wife
may
health
and
wealth
attend
you
and
happiness
through
life
and
as
you
sit
of
evenings
that
quiet
room
within
know
that
in
spirit
i
shall
be
your
guest
as
i
have
been
so
fill
and
place
beside
that
chair
that
dainty
methinks
that
ghostly
hands
shall
take
the
tempting
offering
up
that
ghostly
lips
shall
touch
the
bowl
and
quaff
the
ruby
wine
pledging
in
true
affection
this
toast
to
thee
and
thine
may
god
best
blessings
fall
as
falls
the
gentle
gracious
dew
upon
the
kindly
household
at
the
boltons
dibdin
ghost
dear
wife
last
midnight
whilst
i
read
the
tomes
you
so
despise
a
spectre
rose
beside
the
bed
and
spake
in
this
true
wise
from
canaan
beatific
coast
i
come
to
visit
thee
for
i
am
frognall
dibdin
ghost
says
dibdin
ghost
to
me
i
bade
him
welcome
and
we
twain
discussed
with
buoyant
hearts
the
various
things
that
appertain
to
bibliomaniac
arts
since
you
are
fresh
from
t
other
side
pray
tell
me
of
that
host
that
treasured
books
before
they
died
says
i
to
dibdin
ghost
they
entered
into
perfect
rest
for
in
the
life
they
won
there
are
no
auctions
to
molest
no
creditors
to
dun
their
heavenly
rapture
has
no
bounds
beside
that
jasper
sea
it
is
a
joy
unknown
to
lowndes
says
dibdin
ghost
to
me
much
i
rejoiced
to
hear
him
speak
of
above
for
i
am
one
of
those
who
seek
what
bibliomaniacs
love
but
tell
me
for
i
long
to
hear
what
doth
concern
me
most
are
wives
admitted
to
that
sphere
says
i
to
dibdin
ghost
the
women
folk
are
few
up
there
for
not
fair
you
know
that
they
our
heavenly
joy
should
share
who
vex
us
here
below
the
few
are
those
who
have
been
kind
to
husbands
such
as
we
they
knew
our
fads
and
did
mind
says
dibdin
ghost
to
me
but
what
of
those
who
scold
at
us
when
we
would
read
in
bed
or
wanting
victuals
make
a
fuss
if
we
buy
books
instead
and
what
of
those
who
dusted
not
our
motley
pride
and
boast
shall
they
profane
that
sacred
spot
says
i
to
dibdin
ghost
oh
no
they
tread
that
other
path
which
leads
where
torments
roll
and
worms
yes
bookworms
vent
their
wrath
upon
the
guilty
soul
untouched
of
bibliomaniac
grace
that
saveth
such
as
we
they
wallow
in
that
dreadful
place
says
dibdin
ghost
to
me
to
my
dear
wife
will
i
recite
what
things
i
heard
you
say
she
let
me
read
the
books
by
night
she
let
me
buy
by
day
for
we
together
by
and
by
would
join
that
heavenly
host
she
earned
a
rest
as
well
as
i
says
i
to
dibdin
ghost
the
hawthorne
children
the
hawthorne
children
seven
in
all
are
famous
friends
of
mine
and
with
what
pleasure
i
recall
how
years
ago
one
gloomy
fall
i
took
a
tedious
railway
line
and
journeyed
by
slow
stages
down
unto
that
soporiferous
town
albeit
one
worth
seeing
where
hildegarde
john
henry
fred
and
beatrix
and
gwendolen
and
she
that
was
the
baby
then
these
famous
seven
as
aforesaid
lived
moved
and
had
their
being
the
hawthorne
children
gave
me
such
a
welcome
by
the
sea
that
the
eight
of
us
were
soon
in
touch
and
though
their
mother
marvelled
much
happy
as
larks
were
we
egad
i
was
a
boy
again
with
henry
john
and
gwendolen
and
oh
the
funny
capers
i
cut
with
hildegarde
and
fred
and
oh
the
pranks
we
children
played
and
oh
the
deafening
noise
we
made
shock
my
family
if
they
read
about
it
in
the
papers
the
hawthorne
children
all
were
smart
the
girls
as
i
recall
had
comprehended
every
art
appealing
to
the
head
and
heart
the
boys
were
gifted
all
was
hildegarde
who
showed
me
how
to
hitch
a
horse
and
milk
a
cow
and
cook
the
best
of
suppers
with
beatrix
upon
the
sands
i
sprinted
daily
and
was
beat
was
henry
trained
me
to
the
feat
of
walking
round
upon
my
hands
instead
of
on
my
uppers
the
hawthorne
children
liked
me
best
of
evenings
after
tea
for
then
by
general
request
i
spun
them
yarns
about
the
west
yarns
all
involving
me
i
represented
how
i
slain
the
bison
on
his
native
plain
and
divers
tales
of
wonder
i
told
of
how
i
fought
and
bled
in
indian
scrimmages
galore
till
hawthorne
quoth
no
more
and
packed
her
darlings
off
to
bed
to
dream
of
blood
and
thunder
they
must
have
changed
a
deal
since
then
the
misses
tall
and
fair
and
those
three
handsome
lusty
men
would
they
be
girls
and
boys
again
were
i
to
happen
there
down
in
that
spot
beside
the
sea
where
we
made
such
tumultuous
glee
that
dull
autumnal
weather
ah
me
the
years
go
swiftly
by
and
yet
how
fondly
i
recall
the
week
when
we
were
children
all
dear
hawthorne
children
you
and
i
just
eight
of
us
together
the
bottle
and
the
bird
once
on
a
time
a
friend
of
mine
prevailed
on
me
to
go
to
see
the
dazzling
splendors
of
a
sinful
ballet
show
and
after
we
had
revelled
in
the
saltatory
sights
we
sought
a
neighboring
for
more
tangible
delights
when
i
demanded
of
my
friend
what
viands
he
preferred
he
quoth
a
large
cold
bottle
and
a
small
hot
bird
fool
that
i
was
i
did
not
know
what
anguish
hidden
lies
within
the
morceau
that
allures
the
nostrils
and
the
eyes
there
is
a
glorious
candor
in
an
honest
quart
of
wine
a
certain
inspiration
which
i
can
not
well
define
how
it
bubbles
how
it
sparkles
how
its
gurgling
seems
to
say
come
on
a
tide
of
rapture
let
me
float
your
soul
away
but
the
crispy
steaming
mouthful
that
is
spread
upon
your
plate
how
it
discounts
human
sapience
and
satirizes
fate
you
would
think
a
thing
so
small
could
cause
the
pains
and
aches
that
certainly
accrue
to
him
that
of
that
thing
partakes
to
me
at
least
a
guileless
wight
it
never
once
occurred
what
horror
was
encompassed
in
that
small
hot
bird
oh
what
a
head
i
had
on
me
when
i
awoke
next
day
and
what
a
firm
conviction
of
intestinal
decay
what
seas
of
mineral
water
and
of
bromide
i
applied
to
quench
those
fierce
volcanic
fires
that
rioted
inside
and
oh
the
thousand
solemn
awful
vows
i
plighted
then
never
to
tax
my
system
with
a
small
hot
bird
again
the
doctor
seemed
to
doubt
that
birds
could
worry
people
so
but
bless
him
since
i
ate
the
bird
i
guess
i
ought
to
know
the
acidous
condition
of
my
stomach
so
he
said
bespoke
a
vinous
irritant
that
amplified
my
head
and
ergo
the
causation
of
the
thing
as
he
inferred
was
the
large
cold
bottle
the
small
hot
bird
of
course
i
know
it
was
and
i
sure
you
say
i
right
if
ever
it
has
been
your
wont
to
train
around
at
night
how
sweet
is
retrospection
when
one
heart
is
bathed
in
wine
and
before
its
balmy
breath
how
do
the
ills
of
life
decline
how
the
gracious
juices
drown
what
griefs
would
vex
a
mortal
breast
and
float
the
flattered
soul
into
the
port
of
dreamless
rest
but
you
o
noxious
pygmy
bird
whether
it
be
you
fly
or
paddle
in
the
stagnant
pools
that
sweltering
festering
lie
i
curse
you
and
your
evil
kind
for
that
you
do
me
wrong
engendering
poisons
that
corrupt
my
petted
muse
of
song
go
get
thee
hence
and
never
more
discomfit
me
and
mine
i
fain
would
barter
all
thy
brood
for
one
sweet
draught
of
wine
so
hither
come
o
sportive
youth
when
fades
the
telltale
day
come
hither
with
your
fillets
and
your
wreaths
of
posies
gay
we
shall
unloose
the
fragrant
seas
of
seething
frothing
wine
which
now
the
cobwebbed
glass
and
envious
wire
and
corks
confine
and
midst
the
pleasing
revelry
the
praises
shall
be
heard
of
the
large
cold
bottle
the
small
hot
bird
an
eclogue
from
virgil
the
exile
melibœus
finds
tityrus
in
possession
of
his
own
farm
restored
to
him
by
the
emperor
augustus
and
a
conversation
ensues
the
poem
is
in
praise
of
augustus
peace
and
pastoral
life
melibœus
tityrus
all
in
the
shade
of
the
reclining
sweet
is
that
music
you
made
on
your
pipe
that
is
oaten
and
slender
exiles
from
home
you
beguile
our
hearts
from
their
hopeless
repining
as
you
sing
amaryllis
the
while
in
pastorals
tuneful
and
tender
tityrus
a
god
yes
a
god
i
declare
vouchsafes
me
these
pleasant
conditions
and
often
i
gayly
repair
with
a
tender
white
lamb
to
his
altar
he
gives
me
the
leisure
to
play
my
greatly
admired
compositions
while
my
heifers
go
browsing
all
day
unhampered
of
bell
and
of
halter
melibœus
i
do
not
begrudge
you
repose
i
simply
admit
i
confounded
to
find
you
unscathed
of
the
woes
of
pillage
and
tumult
and
battle
to
exile
and
hardship
devote
and
by
merciless
enemies
hounded
i
drag
at
this
wretched
old
goat
and
coax
on
my
famishing
cattle
oh
often
the
omens
presaged
the
horrors
which
now
overwhelm
me
but
come
if
not
elsewise
engaged
who
this
good
deity
tell
me
tityrus
reminiscently
the
city
the
city
called
rome
with
my
head
full
of
herding
and
tillage
i
used
to
compare
with
my
home
these
pastures
wherein
you
now
wander
but
i
did
take
long
to
find
out
that
the
city
surpasses
the
village
as
the
cypress
surpasses
the
sprout
that
thrives
in
the
thicket
out
yonder
melibœus
tell
me
good
gossip
i
pray
what
led
you
to
visit
the
city
tityrus
liberty
which
on
a
day
regarded
my
lot
with
compassion
my
age
and
distresses
forsooth
compelled
that
proud
mistress
to
pity
that
had
snubbed
the
attentions
of
youth
in
most
reprehensible
fashion
oh
happy
thrice
happy
the
day
when
the
cold
galatea
forsook
me
and
equally
happy
i
say
the
hour
when
that
other
girl
took
me
melibœus
slyly
as
if
addressing
the
damsel
so
now
amaryllis
the
truth
of
your
grief
i
discover
you
pined
for
a
favorite
youth
with
cityfied
damsels
hobnobbing
and
soon
your
surroundings
partook
of
your
grief
for
your
recusant
lover
the
the
copse
and
the
brook
for
tityrus
ever
went
sobbing
tityrus
melibœus
what
else
could
i
do
fate
doled
me
no
morsel
of
pity
my
toil
was
all
vain
the
year
through
no
matter
how
earnest
or
clever
till
at
last
came
that
god
among
men
that
king
from
that
wonderful
city
and
quoth
take
your
homesteads
again
they
are
yours
and
your
assigns
forever
melibœus
happy
oh
happy
old
man
rich
in
what
better
than
money
rich
in
contentment
you
can
gather
sweet
peace
by
mere
listening
bees
with
soft
murmurings
go
hither
and
thither
for
honey
cattle
all
gratefully
low
in
pastures
where
fountains
are
glistening
hark
in
the
shade
of
that
rock
the
pruner
with
singing
rejoices
the
dove
in
the
elm
and
the
flock
of
hoarsely
repining
the
plash
of
the
sacred
cascade
ah
restful
indeed
are
these
voices
tityrus
all
in
the
shade
of
your
reclining
tityrus
and
he
who
insures
this
to
me
oh
craven
i
were
not
to
love
him
nay
rather
the
fish
of
the
sea
shall
vacate
the
water
they
swim
in
the
stag
quit
his
bountiful
grove
to
graze
in
the
ether
above
him
while
folk
antipodean
rove
along
with
their
children
and
women
melibœus
suddenly
recalling
his
own
misery
but
we
who
are
exiled
must
go
and
whither
ah
whither
god
knoweth
some
into
those
regions
of
snow
or
of
desert
where
death
reigneth
only
some
off
to
the
country
of
crete
where
rapid
oaxes
down
floweth
and
desperate
others
retreat
to
britain
the
bleak
isle
and
lonely
dear
land
of
my
birth
shall
i
see
the
horde
of
invaders
oppress
thee
shall
the
wealth
that
outspringeth
from
thee
by
the
hand
of
the
alien
be
squandered
dear
cottage
wherein
i
was
born
shall
another
in
conquest
possess
thee
another
demolish
in
scorn
the
fields
and
the
groves
where
wandered
my
flock
nevermore
shall
you
graze
on
that
hillside
above
me
gone
gone
are
the
halcyon
days
when
my
reed
piped
defiance
to
sorrow
nevermore
in
the
grot
shall
i
sing
of
the
loved
ones
that
love
me
let
yesterday
peace
be
forgot
in
dread
of
the
stormy
tityrus
but
rest
you
this
night
with
me
here
my
bed
we
will
share
it
together
as
soon
as
you
tasted
my
cheer
my
apples
and
chestnuts
and
cheeses
the
evening
already
is
nigh
the
shadows
creep
over
the
heather
and
the
smoke
is
rocked
up
to
the
sky
to
the
lullaby
song
of
the
breezes
pittypat
and
tippytoe
all
day
long
they
come
and
go
pittypat
and
tippytoe
footprints
up
and
down
the
hall
playthings
scattered
on
the
floor
along
the
wall
streaks
upon
the
door
by
these
presents
you
shall
know
pittypat
and
tippytoe
how
they
riot
at
their
play
and
a
dozen
times
a
day
in
they
troop
demanding
bread
only
buttered
bread
will
do
and
that
butter
must
be
spread
inches
thick
with
sugar
too
never
yet
have
i
said
no
pittypat
and
tippytoe
sometimes
there
are
griefs
to
soothe
sometimes
ruffled
brows
to
smooth
for
i
much
regret
to
say
tippytoe
and
pittypat
sometimes
interrupt
their
play
with
an
internecine
spat
fie
oh
fie
to
quarrel
so
pittypat
and
tippytoe
oh
the
thousand
worrying
things
every
day
recurrent
brings
hands
to
scrub
and
hair
to
brush
search
for
playthings
gone
amiss
many
a
murmuring
to
hush
many
a
little
bump
to
kiss
life
indeed
a
fleeting
show
pittypat
and
tippytoe
and
when
day
is
at
an
end
there
are
little
duds
to
mend
little
frocks
are
strangely
torn
little
shoes
great
holes
reveal
little
hose
but
one
day
worn
rudely
yawn
at
toe
or
heel
who
but
you
could
work
such
woe
pittypat
and
tippytoe
but
when
comes
this
thought
to
me
some
there
are
that
childless
be
stealing
to
their
little
beds
with
a
love
i
can
not
speak
tenderly
i
stroke
their
heads
fondly
kiss
each
velvet
cheek
god
help
those
who
do
not
know
a
pittypat
or
tippytoe
on
the
floor
along
the
hall
rudely
traced
upon
the
wall
there
are
proofs
in
every
kind
of
the
havoc
they
have
wrought
and
upon
my
heart
you
find
just
such
trademarks
if
you
sought
oh
how
glad
i
am
is
so
pittypat
and
tippytoe
ashes
on
the
slide
when
jim
and
bill
and
i
were
boys
a
many
years
ago
how
gayly
did
we
use
to
hail
the
coming
of
the
snow
our
sleds
fresh
painted
red
and
with
their
runners
round
and
bright
seemed
to
respond
right
briskly
to
our
clamor
of
delight
as
we
dragged
them
up
the
slippery
road
that
climbed
the
rugged
hill
where
perched
the
old
frame
so
and
still
ah
coasting
in
those
days
those
good
old
days
was
fun
indeed
sleds
at
that
time
i
have
you
know
were
paragons
of
speed
and
if
the
hill
got
bare
in
spots
as
hills
will
do
why
then
we
haul
on
ice
and
snow
to
patch
those
bald
spots
up
again
but
oh
with
what
sad
certainty
our
spirits
would
subside
when
deacon
frisbee
sprinkled
ashes
where
we
used
to
slide
the
deacon
he
would
roll
his
eyes
and
gnash
his
toothless
gums
and
clear
his
skinny
throat
and
twirl
his
saintly
bony
thumbs
and
tell
you
when
i
wuz
a
boy
they
taught
me
to
eschew
the
godless
ribald
vanities
which
modern
youth
pursue
the
pathway
that
leads
down
to
hell
is
slippery
straight
and
wide
and
satan
lurks
for
prey
where
little
boys
are
wont
to
slide
now
he
who
ever
in
his
life
has
been
a
little
boy
will
not
reprove
me
when
he
hears
the
language
i
employ
to
stigmatize
as
wickedness
the
deacon
zealous
spite
in
interfering
with
the
play
wherein
we
found
delight
and
so
i
say
with
confidence
not
unalloyed
of
pride
gol
durn
the
man
who
sprinkles
ashes
where
the
youngsters
slide
but
deacon
frisbee
long
ago
went
to
his
lasting
rest
his
money
well
invested
in
farm
mortgages
out
west
bill
jim
and
i
no
longer
boys
have
learned
through
years
of
strife
that
the
troubles
of
the
little
boy
pursue
the
man
through
life
that
here
and
there
along
the
course
wherein
we
hoped
to
glide
some
envious
hand
has
sprinkled
ashes
just
to
spoil
our
slide
and
that
malicious
envious
hand
is
not
the
deacon
now
grim
ruthless
fate
that
evil
sprite
none
other
is
than
thou
riches
and
honors
peace
and
care
come
at
thy
beck
and
go
the
soul
elate
with
joy
writhes
in
woe
and
till
a
man
has
turned
his
face
unto
the
wall
and
died
he
must
expect
to
get
his
share
of
ashes
on
his
slide

oh
they
are
a
cruel
twain
thinking
of
them
makes
me

oft
with
all
his
might
and
main
cupid
sends
those
darts
profane
whizzing
through
my
heart

straightway
back

and
bind

but
watch
out
christmas
eve
oh
hush
thee
little
the
evening
shades
are
falling
hush
thee
my
dear
dost
thou
not
hear
the
voice
of
the
master
calling
deep
lies
the
snow
upon
the
earth
but
all
the
sky
is
ringing
with
joyous
song
and
all
night
long
the
stars
shall
dance
with
singing
oh
hush
thee
little
and
close
thine
eyes
in
dreaming
and
angels
fair
shall
lead
thee
where
the
singing
stars
are
beaming
a
shepherd
calls
his
little
lambs
and
he
longeth
to
caress
them
he
bids
them
rest
upon
his
breast
that
his
tender
love
may
bless
them
so
hush
thee
little
whilst
evening
shades
are
falling
and
above
the
song
of
the
heavenly
throng
thou
shalt
hear
the
master
calling
carlsbad
dear
palmer
just
a
year
ago
we
did
the
carlsbad
cure
which
though
it
be
exceeding
slow
is
as
exceeding
sure
to
corpulency
you
were
prone
dyspepsia
bothered
me
you
tipped
the
beam
at
twenty
stone
and
i
at
ten
stone
three
the
cure
they
told
us
works
both
ways
it
makes
the
fat
man
lean
the
thin
man
after
many
days
achieves
a
portly
mien
and
though
it
true
you
still
are
fat
while
i
am
like
a
crow
all
skin
and
feathers
what
of
that
the
cure
takes
time
you
know
the
carlsbad
scenery
is
sublime
that
what
the
say
we
did
not
think
so
at
that
time
nor
think
so
the
bluffs
that
squeeze
the
panting
town
permit
no
pleasing
views
but
weigh
the
mortal
spirits
down
and
give
a
chap
the
blues
with
nothing
to
amuse
us
then
or
mitigate
our
spleen
we
rose
and
went
to
bed
again
with
three
bad
meals
between
and
constantly
we
made
our
moan
ah
none
so
drear
as
we
when
you
were
weighing
twenty
stone
and
i
but
ten
stone
three
we
never
scaled
the
for
walking
was
my
bane
and
you
were
much
too
big
to
ride
the
mules
that
there
obtain
and
so
we
loitered
in
the
shade
with
israel
out
in
force
or
through
the
allee
strayed
and
heard
the
band
discourse
sometimes
it
pleased
us
to
recline
upon
the
tepl
brink
or
watch
the
bilious
human
line
file
round
to
get
a
drink
anon
the
portier
piping
tone
embittered
you
and
me
when
you
were
weighing
twenty
stone
and
i
but
ten
stone
three
and
oh
those
awful
things
to
eat
no
pudding
cake
or
pie
but
just
a
little
dab
of
meat
and
crusts
absurdly
dry
then
too
that
water
twice
a
day
one
swallow
was
enough
to
take
one
appetite
away
the
tepid
awful
stuff
tortured
by
hunger
cruel
stings
i
little
else
to
do
than
feast
my
eyes
upon
the
things
prescribed
and
cooked
for
you
the
goodies
went
to
you
alone
the
husks
all
fell
to
me
when
you
were
weighing
twenty
stone
and
i
weighed
ten
stone
three
yet
happy
days
and
rapturous
ills
and
sweetly
dismal
date
when
sandwiched
in
between
those
hills
we
twain
bemoaned
our
fate
the
little
woes
we
suffered
then
like
mists
have
sped
away
and
i
were
glad
to
share
again
those
ills
with
you
to
flounder
in
those
rains
of
june
that
flood
that
austrian
vale
to
quaff
that
tepid
kaiserbrunn
and
starve
on
victuals
stale
and
often
leagues
and
leagues
away
from
where
we
suffered
then
with
envious
yearnings
i
survey
what
can
not
be
again
and
often
in
my
quiet
home
through
dim
and
misty
eyes
i
seem
to
see
that
curhaus
dome
blink
at
the
radiant
skies
i
seem
to
hear
that
wiener
band
above
the
tepl
roar
to
feel
the
pressure
of
your
hand
and
hear
your
voice
once
more
and
better
yet
my
heart
is
warm
with
thoughts
of
you
and
yours
for
friendship
hath
a
sweeter
charm
than
thrice
ten
thousand
cures
so
i
am
happy
to
have
known
that
time
across
the
sea
when
you
were
weighing
twenty
stone
and
i
weighed
ten
stone
three
the
tree
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
tree
is
a
marvel
of
great
renown
it
blooms
on
the
shore
of
the
lollipop
sea
in
the
garden
of
town
the
fruit
that
it
bears
is
so
wondrously
sweet
as
those
who
have
tasted
it
say
that
good
little
children
have
only
to
eat
of
that
fruit
to
be
happy
next
day
when
you
got
to
the
tree
you
would
have
a
hard
time
to
capture
the
fruit
which
i
sing
the
tree
is
so
tall
that
no
person
could
climb
to
the
boughs
where
the
swing
but
up
in
that
tree
sits
a
chocolate
cat
and
a
gingerbread
dog
prowls
below
and
this
is
the
way
you
contrive
to
get
at
those
tempting
you
so
you
say
but
the
word
to
that
gingerbread
dog
and
he
barks
with
such
terrible
zest
that
the
chocolate
cat
is
at
once
all
agog
as
her
swelling
proportions
attest
and
the
chocolate
cat
goes
cavorting
around
from
leafy
limb
unto
and
the
tumble
of
course
to
the
ground
hurrah
for
that
chocolate
cat
there
are
marshmallows
and
peppermint
canes
with
stripings
of
scarlet
or
gold
and
you
carry
away
of
the
treasure
that
rains
as
much
as
your
apron
can
hold
so
come
little
child
cuddle
closer
to
me
in
your
dainty
white
nightcap
and
gown
and
i
rock
you
away
to
that
tree
in
the
garden
of
town
red
any
color
so
long
as
it
red
is
the
color
that
suits
me
best
though
i
will
allow
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
yellow
and
green
and
the
rest
but
the
feeble
tints
which
some
affect
in
the
things
they
make
or
buy
have
never
i
say
it
with
all
respect
appealed
to
my
critical
eye
there
that
in
red
that
warmeth
the
blood
and
quickeneth
a
man
within
and
bringeth
to
speedy
and
perfect
bud
the
germs
of
original
sin
so
though
i
properly
born
and
bred
i
own
with
a
certain
zest
that
any
color
so
long
as
it
red
is
the
color
that
suits
me
best
for
where
is
a
color
that
can
compare
with
the
blush
of
a
buxom
lass
or
where
such
warmth
as
of
the
hair
of
the
genuine
white
horse
class
and
lo
reflected
within
this
cup
of
cheery
bordeaux
i
see
what
inspiration
girdeth
me
up
yes
red
is
the
color
for
me
through
acres
and
acres
of
art
i
strayed
in
italy
germany
france
on

young

could
nowhere

his
no

were
chock
full

his

was

he
nourished
a

the

watching
a

turn
up

the
young
lochinvar
her
pulchritude
gave
him
a
pectoral
glow
and
he
reined
up
his
hoss
with
stentorian
whoa
then
turned
on
the
maiden
a
rapturous
grin
and
modestly
asked
if
he
might
step
in
with

that
was
marvellous
quite
the

replied
that
he
might

that

how

the
noisy
men
with
whiskers
on
their
faces
the
pneumogastric
nerve
upon
an
average
twice
a
week
when
anguish
clouds
my
brow
my
good
physician
friend
i
seek
to
know
what
ails
me
now
he
taps
me
on
the
back
and
chest
and
scans
my
tongue
for
bile
and
lays
an
ear
against
my
breast
and
listens
there
awhile
then
is
he
ready
to
admit
that
all
he
can
observe
is
something
wrong
inside
to
wit
my
pneumogastric
nerve
now
when
these
latin
names
within
dyspeptic
hulks
like
mine
go
wrong
a
fellow
should
begin
to
draw
what
called
the
line
it
seems
however
that
this
same
which
in
my
hulk
abounds
is
not
despite
its
awful
name
so
fatal
as
it
sounds
yet
of
all
torments
known
to
me
i
say
without
reserve
there
is
no
torment
like
to
thee
thou
pneumogastric
nerve
this
subtle
envious
nerve
appears
to
be
a
patient
foe
it
waited
nearly
forty
years
its
chance
to
lay
me
low
then
like
some
blithering
blast
of
hell
it
struck
this
guileless
bard
and
in
that
evil
hour
i
fell
prodigious
far
and
hard
alas
what
things
i
dearly
love
pies
puddings
and
preserves
are
sure
to
rouse
the
vengeance
of
all
pneumogastric
nerves
oh
that
i
could
remodel
man
i
end
these
cruel
pains
by
hitting
on
a
different
plan
from
that
which
now
obtains
the
stomach
greatly
amplified
anon
should
occupy
the
all
of
that
domain
inside
where
heart
and
lungs
now
lie
but
first
of
all
i
should
depose
that
diabolic
curve
and
author
of
my
thousand
woes
the
pneumogastric
nerve
every
evening
after
tea
comes
to
me
and
astride
my
willing
knee
plies
his
lash
and
rides
away
though
that
palfrey
all
too
spare
finds
his
burden
hard
to
bear
does
care
he
commands
and
i
obey
first
it
trot
and
gallop
then
now
it
back
to
trot
again
likes
it
when
he
is
riding
fierce
and
fast
then
his
dark
eyes
brighter
grow
and
his
cheeks
are
all
aglow
more
he
cries
and
never
whoa
till
the
horse
breaks
down
at
last
oh
the
strange
and
lovely
sights
sees
of
nights
as
he
makes
those
famous
flights
on
that
wondrous
horse
of
his
oftentimes
before
he
knows
wearylike
his
eyelids
close
and
still
smiling
off
he
goes
where
the
land
of
is
there
he
sees
the
folk
of
fay
hard
at
play
and
he
hears
those
fairies
say
come
let
chase
him
to
and
fro
but
with
a
defiant
shout
teeny
puts
that
host
to
rout
of
this
tale
i
make
no
doubt
every
night
he
tells
it
so
so
i
feel
a
tender
pride
in
my
boy
who
dares
to
ride
that
fierce
horse
of
his
astride
off
into
those
misty
lands
and
as
on
my
breast
he
lies
dreaming
in
that
wondrous
wise
i
caress
his
folded
eyes
pat
his
little
dimpled
hands
on
a
time
he
went
away
just
a
little
while
to
stay
and
i
not
ashamed
to
say
i
was
very
lonely
then
life
without
him
was
so
sad
you
can
fancy
i
was
glad
and
made
merry
when
i
had
back
again
so
of
evenings
after
tea
when
he
toddles
up
to
me
and
goes
tugging
at
my
knee
you
should
hear
his
palfrey
neigh
you
should
see
him
prance
and
shy
when
with
an
exulting
cry
vaulting
high
plies
his
lash
and
rides
away
telka
through
those
golden
summer
days
our
twin
flocks
were
wont
to
graze
on
the
hillside
which
the
sun
rested
lovingly
upon
telka
flock
and
mine
and
we
sung
our
songs
in
rapturous
glee
idling
in
the
pleasant
shade
which
the
solemn
made
while
the
brook
anear
us
played
and
a
white
rose
grew
in
the
shadow
of
the
yew
telka
loved
me
passing
well
how
i
loved
her
none
can
tell
how
i
love
her
none
may
know
oh
that
man
love
woman
so
when
she
was
not
at
my
side
loud
my
heart
in
anguish
cried
and
my
lips
till
she
replied
yet
they
think
to
silence
me
as
if
love
could
silenced
be
fool
were
i
and
fools
were
they
still
i
wend
my
lonely
way
telka
evermore
i
cry
answer
me
the
woods
and
sky
and
the
weary
years
go
by
telka
she
was
passing
fair
and
the
glory
of
her
hair
was
such
glory
as
the
sun
with
his
blessing
casts
upon
yonder
lonely
mountain
height
lifting
up
to
bid
to
her
sovereign
in
the
west
sinking
wearily
to
rest
drowsing
in
that
golden
sea
where
the
realms
of
dreamland
be
so
our
love
to
fulness
grew
whilst
beneath
the
solemn
yew
paled
the
rose
of
white
as
it
were
some
fancied
sight
blanched
it
with
a
dread
affright
telka
she
was
passing
fair
and
our
peace
was
perfect
there
till
enchanted
by
her
smile
lurked
the
south
wind
there
awhile
underneath
that
hillside
tree
where
with
singing
idled
we
and
i
heard
the
south
wind
say
flattering
words
to
her
that
day
of
a
city
far
away
but
the
crouched
as
though
it
were
like
to
whisper
no
to
the
words
the
south
wind
said
as
he
smoothed
my
telka
head
and
the
brook
all
pleading
cried
to
the
dear
one
at
my
side
linger
always
where
i
am
stray
not
thence
o
cosset
lamb
wander
not
where
shadows
deep
on
the
treacherous
quicksands
sleep
and
the
haunted
waters
leap
be
thou
ware
the
waves
that
flow
toward
the
prison
pool
below
where
beguiled
from
yonder
sky
captive
moonbeams
shivering
lie
and
at
dawn
of
morrow
die
so
the
brook
to
telka
cried
but
my
telka
naught
replied
and
as
in
a
strange
affright
paled
the
rose
a
ghostlier
white
when
anon
the
north
wind
came
rudely
blustering
telka
name
and
he
kissed
the
leaves
that
grew
round
about
the
trembling
yew
kissed
and
romped
till
blushing
red
all
one
day
in
terror
fled
and
the
white
rose
hung
her
head
coming
to
our
trysting
spot
long
i
called
she
answered
not
telka
pleadingly
i
cried
up
and
down
the
where
we
twain
were
wont
to
bide
there
were
those
who
thought
that
i
could
be
silenced
with
a
lie
and
they
told
me
telka
name
should
be
spoken
now
with
shame
she
is
lost
to
us
and
thee
that
is
what
they
said
to
me
is
my
telka
lost
quoth
i
on
this
hilltop
shall
i
cry
so
that
she
may
hear
and
then
find
her
way
to
me
again
the
south
wind
spoke
a
lie
that
day
all
deceived
she
lost
her
way
yonder
where
the
shadows
sleep
the
haunted
waves
that
leap
over
treacherous
quicksands
deep
and
where
captive
moonbeams
lie
doomed
at
morrow
dawn
to
die
she
is
lost
and
that
is
all
i
will
search
for
her
and
call
summer
comes
and
winter
goes
buds
the
yew
and
blooms
the
rose
all
the
others
are
anear
only
telka
is
not
here
gone
the
peace
and
love
i
knew
sometime
the
hillside
yew
and
the
rose
that
mocks
me
so
i
had
crushed
it
long
ago
but
that
telka
loved
it
then
and
shall
soothe
its
terror
when
she
comes
back
to
me
again
call
i
seek
i
everywhere
for
my
telka
passing
fair
it
is
oh
so
many
a
year
i
have
called
she
does
not
hear
yet
nor
feared
nor
worn
am
i
for
i
know
that
if
i
cry
she
shall
sometime
hear
my
call
she
is
lost
and
that
is
all
she
is
lost
in
some
far
spot
i
have
searched
and
found
it
not
could
she
hear
me
calling
then
would
she
come
to
me
again
for
she
loved
me
passing
well
how
i
love
her
none
can
tell
that
is
why
these
years
i
cried
telka
on
this
telka
still
i
pleading
cry
answer
me
the
woods
and
sky
and
the
lonely
years
go
by
on
an
evening
dark
and
chill
came
a
shadow
up
the
hill
came
a
spectre
grim
and
white
as
a
ghost
that
walks
the
night
grim
and
bowed
and
with
the
cry
of
a
wretch
about
to
die
came
and
fell
and
cried
to
me
it
is
telka
come
said
she
so
she
fell
and
so
she
cried
on
that
lonely
where
was
telka
wont
to
bide
who
hath
bribed
those
lips
to
lie
telka
face
was
fair
quoth
i
thine
is
furrowed
with
despair
there
is
winter
in
thy
hair
but
upon
her
beauteous
head
was
there
summer
glory
shed
such
a
glory
as
the
sun
when
his
daily
course
is
run
smiles
upon
this
mountain
height
as
he
kisses
it
there
was
music
in
her
tone
misery
in
thy
voice
alone
they
have
bid
thee
lie
to
me
let
me
pass
thou
art
not
she
let
my
sorrow
sacred
be
underneath
this
trysting
tree
so
in
wrath
i
went
my
way
and
they
came
another
day
came
another
day
and
said
hush
thy
cry
for
she
is
dead
yonder
on
the
she
is
buried
where
she
died
where
you
twain
were
wont
to
bide
where
she
came
and
fell
and
cried
pardon
that
thy
wrath
denied
and
above
her
bosom
grows
as
in
mockery
the
rose
it
was
white
but
now
is
red
and
in
shame
it
bows
its
head
over
sinful
telka
dead
so
they
thought
to
silence
me
as
if
love
could
silenced
be
fool
were
i
and
fools
were
they
scornfully
i
went
my
way
and
upon
the
telka
evermore
i
cried
telka
evermore
i
cry
answer
me
the
woods
and
sky
so
the
lonely
years
go
by
she
is
lost
and
that
is
all
sometime
she
shall
hear
my
call
hear
my
pleading
call
and
then
find
her
way
to
me
again
plaint
of
the
missouri
in
the
berlin
zoölogical
gardens
friend
by
the
way
you
hump
yourself
you
from
the
states
i
know
and
born
in
old
mizzoorah
where
the
in
plenty
grow
i
too
am
native
of
that
clime
but
harsh
relentless
fate
has
doomed
me
to
an
exile
far
from
that
noble
state
and
i
who
used
to
climb
around
and
swing
from
tree
to
tree
now
lead
a
life
of
ignominious
ease
as
you
can
see
have
pity
o
compatriot
mine
and
bide
a
season
near
while
i
unfurl
a
dismal
tale
to
catch
your
friendly
ear
my
pedigree
is
noble
they
used
my
grandsire
skin
to
piece
a
coat
for
patterson
to
warm
himself
within
tom
patterson
of
denver
no
ermine
can
compare
with
the
grizzled
robe
that
democratic
statesman
loves
to
wear
of
such
a
grandsire
i
am
come
and
in
the
county
cole
all
up
an
ancient
cottonwood
our
family
had
its
hole
we
envied
not
the
liveried
pomp
nor
proud
estate
of
kings
as
we
hustled
round
from
day
to
day
in
search
of
bugs
and
things
and
when
the
darkness
fell
around
a
was
nigh
inviting
pleasant
soothing
dreams
with
his
sweet
lullaby
and
sometimes
came
the
yellow
dog
to
brag
around
all
night
that
nary
could
wallop
him
in
a
barrel
fight
we
simply
smiled
and
let
him
howl
for
all
mizzoorians
know
that
ary
can
best
a
dog
if
the
coon
gets
half
a
show
but
we
nestle
close
and
shiver
when
the
mellow
moon
had
and
the
hungry
nigger
sought
our
lair
in
hopes
to
make
us
raised
as
i
was
it
hardly
strange
i
pine
for
those
old
days
i
can
not
get
acclimated
or
used
to
german
ways
the
victuals
that
they
give
me
here
may
all
be
very
fine
for
vulgar
common
palates
but
they
will
not
do
for
mine
the
that
been
accustomed
to
stanch
democratic
cheer
will
not
put
up
with
onion
tarts
and
sausage
steeped
in
beer
no
let
the
rest
for
meat
and
drink
accede
to
slavish
terms
but
send
back
from
whence
i
came
and
let
me
grub
for
worms
they
come
these
gaping
teutons
do
on
sunday
afternoons
and
wonder
what
i
am
alas
there
are
no
german
for
if
there
were
i
still
might
swing
at
home
from
tree
to
tree
the
symbol
of
democracy
that
woolly
blithe
and
free
and
yet
for
what
my
captors
are
i
would
not
change
my
lot
for
have
tasted
liberty
these
others
have
not
so
even
caged

corinthian
hall
corinthian
hall
is
a
place
which
some
finical
folks
have
pronounced
a
disgrace
but
once
was
a
time
when
corinthian
hall
excited
the
rapture
and
plaudits
of
all
with
its
carpeted
stairs
and
its
new
yellow
chairs
and
its
stunning
of
citified
airs
why
the
atchison
champion
said
was
the
best
of
thespian
temples
extant
in
the
west
it
was
new
and
was
ours
that
was
ages
ago
before
opry
had
spoiled
the
legitimate
show
it
was
new
and
was
ours
we
could
toss
back
the
jeers
our
rivals
had
launched
at
our
city
for
years
corinthian
hall
why
it
discounted
all
other
halls
in
the
valley
and
well
i
recall
the
night
of
the
opening
from
near
and
afar
came
the
crowd
to
see
toodles
performed
by
de
bar
oh
those
days
they
were
palmy
and
never
again
shall
earth
see
such
genius
as
gladdened
us
then
for
actors
were
actors
and
each
one
knew
how
to
whoop
up
his
art
in
the
sweat
of
his
brow
he
a
tragedy
air
and
wore
copious
hair
and
when
he
ate
victuals
he
ordered
rare
dame
fortune
feazed
him
in
fact
never
could
when
liquor
was
handy
and
walking
was
good
and
the
shows
in
those
days
ah
how
well
i
recall
the
shows
that
i
saw
in
corinthian
hall
maggie
mitchell
and
lotty
were
then
in
their
prime
and
as
for
jane
coombs
she
was
simply
sublime
and
i
ready
to
swear
there
is
none
could
compare
with
breslau
in
borgia
supported
by
fair
while
in
passionate
rôles
it
was
patent
to
us
that
the
great
john
stevens
was
ultra
and
was
there
demand
for
the
tribute
of
tears
we
had
sweet
charlotte
thompson
those
halcyon
years
and
wee
katie
putnam
the
savants
allow
that
the
like
of
kate
fisher
ai
visible
now
what
artist
have
we
equal
to
rae
or
to
sturdy
jack
langrishe
god
rest
i
say
and
when
died
buchanan
the
joe
gazette
opined
that
the
sun
of
our
drama
had
set
corinthian
hall
was
devoted
to
song
when
the
barnabee
concert
troupe
happened
along
or
ossian
dodge
or
the
comical
brown
or
the
holmans
with
william
crane
struck
our
town
but
the
one
special
card
that
hit
us
all
hard
was
caroline
richings
and
peter
bernard
and
the
bells
of
the
bergers
still
ring
in
my
ears
and
oh
how
i
laughed
at
sol
russell
those
years
the
haverly
minstrels
were
boss
in
those
days
and
our
critics
accorded
them
columns
of
praise
they
handsome
mustaches
and
big
cluster
rings
and
their
shirt
fronts
were
blazing
with
diamonds
and
things
they
gave
a
parade
and
sweet
music
they
made
every
evening
in
front
of
the
house
where
they
played
posters
and
the
town
was
agog
for
primrose
and
west
in
their
great
statue
clog
many
years
intervene
yet
i
free
to
maintain
that
i
doted
on
chanfrau
mcwade
and
frank
frayne
tom
stivers
the
local
declared
for
a
truth
that
mayo
as
hamlet
was
better
than
booth
while
in
rôles
that
were
thrillin
involving
much
killin
jim
wallick
loomed
up
our
ideal
of
a
villain
bowers
alvin
joslin
frank
aiken
they
all
earned
their
titles
to
fame
in
corinthian
hall
but
time
as
begrudging
the
glory
that
fell
on
the
spot
i
revere
and
remember
so
well
spent
his
spite
on
the
timbers
the
plaster
and
paint
and
breathed
on
them
all
his
morbiferous
taint
so
the
trappings
of
gold
and
the
gear
manifold
got
gangrened
with
rust
and
rheumatic
with
mould
and
we
saw
dank
decay
and
oblivion
fall
like
vapors
of
night
on
corinthian
hall
when
the
gas
is
ablaze
in
the
opry
at
night
and
the
music
goes
floating
on
billows
of
light
why
i
often
regret
that
i
grown
to
a
man
and
i
pine
to
be
back
where
my
mission
began
and
i
fain
to
recall
reminiscences
all
that
come
with
the
thought
of
corinthian
hall
to
hear
and
to
see
what
delighted
me
then
and
to
revel
in
raptures
of
boyhood
again
though
corinthian
hall
is
a
place
which
some
finical
folks
have
pronounced
a
disgrace
there
is
one
young
old
boy
quite
as
worthy
as
they
who
aweary
of
art
as
expounded
would
surrender
what
gold
he
amassed
to
behold
a
tithe
of
the
wonderful
doings
of
old
a
glimpse
of
the
glories
that
used
to
enthrall
our
de
la
in
corinthian
hall
the
red
red
west
i
travelled
in
heaps
of
countries
and
studied
all
kinds
of
art
till
there
is
a
critic
or
connoisseur
who
properly
deemed
so
smart
and
i
free
to
say
that
the
grand
results
of
my
explorations
show
that
somehow
paint
gets
redder
the
farther
out
west
i
go
i
sipped
the
voluptuous
sherbet
that
the
orientals
serve
and
i
felt
the
glow
of
red
bordeaux
tingling
each
separate
nerve
i
sampled
your
classic
massic
under
an
arbor
green
and
i
reeked
with
song
a
whole
night
long
over
a
brown
poteen
the
stalwart
brew
of
the
land
o
cakes
the
schnapps
of
the
frugal
dutch
the
wine
of
the
distant
rhine
and
the
beer
praised
overmuch
the
ale
of
dear
old
london
and
the
port
of
southern
climes
all
have
i
taken
in
a
hundred
thousand
times
yet
as
i
these
other
charms
are
naught
compared
with
the
paramount
gorgeousness
with
which
the
west
is
fraught
for
art
and
nature
are
just
the
same
in
the
land
where
the
porker
grows
and
the
paint
keeps
getting
redder
the
farther
out
west
one
goes
our
savants
have
never
discovered
the
reason
why
this
is
so
and
ninety
per
cent
of
the
laymen
care
less
than
the
savants
know
it
answers
every
purpose
that
this
is
manifest
the
paint
keeps
getting
redder
the
farther
you
go
out
west
give
me
no
home
the
pale
pink
dome
of
european
skies
no
cot
for
me
by
the
salmon
sea
that
far
to
the
southward
lies
but
away
out
west
i
would
build
my
nest
on
top
of
a
carmine
hill
where
i
can
paint
without
restraint
creation
redder
still
the
three
kings
of
cologne
from
out
cologne
there
came
three
kings
to
worship
jesus
christ
their
king
to
him
they
sought
fine
herbs
they
brought
and
many
a
beauteous
golden
thing
they
brought
their
gifts
to
bethlehem
town
and
in
that
manger
set
them
down
then
spake
the
first
king
and
he
said
o
child
most
heavenly
bright
and
fair
i
bring
this
crown
to
bethlehem
town
for
thee
and
only
thee
to
wear
so
give
a
heavenly
crown
to
me
when
i
shall
come
at
last
to
thee
the
second
then
i
bring
thee
here
this
royal
robe
o
child
he
cried
of
silk
is
spun
and
such
an
one
there
is
not
in
the
world
beside
so
in
the
day
of
doom
requite
me
with
a
heavenly
robe
of
white
the
third
king
gave
his
gift
and
quoth
spikenard
and
myrrh
to
thee
i
bring
and
with
these
twain
would
i
most
fain
anoint
the
body
of
my
king
so
may
their
incense
sometime
rise
to
plead
for
me
in
yonder
skies
thus
spake
the
three
kings
of
cologne
that
gave
their
gifts
and
went
their
way
and
now
kneel
i
in
prayer
hard
by
the
cradle
of
the
child
nor
crown
nor
robe
nor
spice
i
bring
as
offering
unto
christ
my
king
yet
have
i
brought
a
gift
the
child
may
not
despise
however
small
for
here
i
lay
my
heart
and
it
is
full
of
love
to
all
take
thou
the
poor
but
loyal
thing
my
only
tribute
christ
my
king
ipswich
in
ipswich
nights
are
cool
and
fair
and
the
voice
that
comes
from
the
yonder
sea
sings
to
the
quaint
old
mansions
there
of
the
time
the
time
that
used
to
be
and
the
quaint
old
mansions
rock
and
groan
and
they
seem
to
say
in
an
undertone
with
half
a
sigh
and
with
half
a
moan
it
was
but
it
never
again
will
be
in
ipswich
witches
weave
at
night
their
magic
spells
with
impish
glee
they
shriek
and
laugh
in
their
demon
flight
from
the
old
main
house
to
the
frightened
sea
and
ghosts
of
eld
come
out
to
weep
over
the
town
that
is
fast
asleep
and
they
sob
and
they
wail
as
on
they
creep
it
was
but
it
never
again
will
be
in
ipswich
riseth
hill
over
against
the
calling
sea
and
through
the
nights
so
deep
and
chill
watcheth
a
maiden
constantly
watcheth
alone
nor
seems
to
hear
over
the
roar
of
the
waves
anear
the
pitiful
cry
of
a
year
it
was
but
it
never
again
will
be
in
ipswich
once
a
witch
i
knew
an
artless
saxon
witch
was
she
by
that
flaxen
hair
and
those
eyes
of
blue
sweet
was
the
spell
she
cast
on
me
alas
but
the
years
have
wrought
me
ill
and
the
heart
that
is
old
and
battered
and
chill
seeketh
again
on
hill
what
was
but
never
again
can
be
dear
anna
i
would
not
conjure
down
the
ghost
that
cometh
to
solace
me
i
love
to
think
of
old
ipswich
town
where
somewhat
better
than
friends
were
we
for
with
every
thought
of
the
dear
old
place
cometh
again
the
tender
grace
of
a
saxon
witch
pretty
face
as
it
was
and
is
and
ever
shall
be
bill
tenor
and
my
bass
bill
was
short
and
dapper
while
i
was
thin
and
tall
i
had
flowin
whiskers
but
bill
had
none
at
all
clothes
would
never
seem
to
set
so
nice
on
as
folks
used
to
laugh
and
say
i
was
too
powerful
slim
but
bill
clothes
fit
him
like
the
paper
on
the
wall
and
we
were
the
beaus
in
all
the
place
when
bill
sung
tenor
and
i
sung
bass
cyrus
baker
oldest
girl
was
member
of
the
choir
eyes
as
black
as
kelsey
cat
and
cheeks
as
red
as
fire
she
had
the
best
sopranner
voice
i
think
i
ever
heard
sung
coronation
burlington
and
chiny
like
a
bird
never
done
better
than
with
bill
nigh
of
her
so
she
would
lose
the
place
when
bill
sung
tenor
and
i
sung
bass
then
there
was
prudence
hubbard
so
and
fat
sung
alto
and
wore
a
hat
beaued
her
around
one
winter
and
first
thing
i
knew
one
evenin
on
the
portico
i
up
and
called
her
prue
but
sakes
alive
she
did
mind
a
little
thing
like
that
on
all
the
works
of
providence
she
set
a
cheerful
face
when
bill
was
singin
tenor
and
i
was
singin
bass
bill
nevermore
we
two
shall
share
the
fun
we
used
to
then
nor
know
the
comfort
and
the
peace
we
had
together
when
we
lived
in
massachusetts
in
the
good
old
courtin
days
and
lifted
up
our
voices
in
psalms
and
hymns
of
praise
oh
how
i
wisht
that
i
could
live
them
happy
times
again
for
life
as
we
boys
knew
it
had
a
sweet
peculiar
grace
when
you
was
singin
tenor
and
i
was
singin
bass
the
music
folks
have
nowadays
ai
what
it
used
to
be
because
there
ai
no
singers
now
on
earth
like
bill
and
me
why
lemuel
bangs
who
used
to
go
to
springfield
twice
a
year
admitted
that
for
singin
bill
and
me
had
not
a
peer
when
bill
went
soarin
up
to
a
and
i
dropped
down
to
d
the
old
beza
dimmitt
played
war
in
the
race
of
bill
high
tenor
and
my
sonorious
bass
bill
moved
to
californy
in
the
spring
of
and
we
folks
that
used
to
know
him
never
knew
him
any
more
then
cyrus
baker
oldest
girl
she
kind
o
pined
a
spell
and
hankerin
after
sympathy
it
naterally
befell
that
she
married
deacon
pitkin
boy
who
kep
the
general
store
and
so
the
years
the
changeful
years
have
rattled
on
apace
since
bill
sung
tenor
and
i
sung
bass
as
i
was
settin
by
the
stove
this
evenin
after
tea
i
noticed
wife
kep
hitchin
close
and
closer
up
to
me
and
as
she
patched
the
gingham
frock
our
wore
i
heerd
her
gin
a
sigh
that
seemed
to
come
from
fur
away
could
help
inquirin
what
the
trouble
might
be
was
thinkin
of
the
time
says
prue
at
her
face
when
bill
sung
tenor
and
you
sung
bass
fiducit
three
comrades
on
the
german
rhine
defying
care
and
weather
together
quaffed
the
mellow
wine
and
sung
their
songs
together
what
recked
they
of
the
griefs
of
life
with
wine
and
song
to
cheer
them
though
elsewhere
trouble
might
be
rife
it
would
not
come
anear
them
anon
one
comrade
passed
away
and
presently
another
and
yet
unto
the
tryst
each
day
repaired
the
lonely
brother
and
still
as
gayly
as
of
old
that
third
one
filled
to
the
brim
each
cup
of
gold
and
called
to
the
departed
o
comrades
mine
i
see
ye
not
nor
hear
your
kindly
greeting
yet
in
this
old
familiar
spot
be
still
our
loving
meeting
here
have
i
filled
each
with
juices
red
and
cheery
i
pray
ye
drink
the
portion
up
and
as
of
old
make
merry
and
once
before
his
eyes
all
in
the
haunted
gloaming
he
saw
two
ghostly
figures
rise
and
quaff
the
beakers
foaming
he
heard
two
spirit
voices
call
fiducit
jovial
brother
and
so
forever
from
that
hall
went
they
with
one
another
the
jo
gazette
when
i
helped
run
the
local
on
the
jo
gazette
i
was
upon
familiar
terms
with
every
one
i
met
for
items
were
my
stock
in
trade
in
that
my
callow
time
before
the
muses
tempted
me
to
try
my
hand
at
rhyme
before
i
found
in
verses
those
soothing
gracious
mercies
less
practical
but
much
more
glorious
than
a
purse
is
a
votary
of
mammon
i
hustled
round
and
sweat
and
helped
run
the
local
on
the
jo
gazette
the
labors
of
the
day
began
at
eight
for
the
farmers
came
in
early
and
i
had
to
tackle
them
and
many
a
noble
bit
of
news
i
managed
to
acquire
by
those
discreet
attentions
which
all
admire
with
my
daily
commentary
on
affairs
of
farm
and
dairy
the
tone
of
which
anon
with
subtle
pufferies
i
vary
oh
many
a
peck
of
apples
and
of
peaches
did
i
get
when
i
helped
run
the
local
on
the
jo
gazette
dramatic
news
was
scarce
but
when
a
minstrel
show
was
due
why
milton
tootle
opera
house
was
then
my
rendezvous
judge
grubb
would
give
me
points
about
the
latest
legal
case
and
runcie
let
me
print
his
sermons
when
i
space
of
fevers
fractures
humors
contusions
fits
and
tumors
would
hall
or
baines
confirm
or
nail
the
rumors
from
colonel
dawes
what
railroad
news
there
was
i
used
to
get
when
i
helped
run
the
local
on
the
jo
gazette
for
personals
the
old
pacific
house
was
just
the
place
pap
abell
knew
the
pedigrees
of
all
the
human
race
and
when
he
gin
up
all
he
had
he
drop
a
subtle
wink
and
lead
the
way
where
one
might
wet
one
whistle
with
a
drink
those
drinks
at
the
pacific
when
days
were
sudorific
were
what
parisians
pray
excuse
my
french
would
call
magnifique
and
frequently
an
invitation
to
a
meal
i
get
when
i
helped
run
the
local
on
the
jo
gazette
and
when
in
rainy
weather
news
was
scarce
as
well
as
slow
to
saxton
bank
or
hopkins
store
for
items
would
i
go
the
jokes
which
colonel
saxton
told
were
old
but
good
enough
for
local
application
in
lieu
of
better
stuff
and
when
the
ducks
were
flying
or
the
fishing
well
worth
trying
gosh
but
those
sports
at
hopkins
store
could
beat
the
world
at
lying
and
i
i
printed
all
their
yarns
though
not
without
regret
when
i
helped
run
the
local
on
the
jo
gazette
for
squibs
political
i
go
to
waller
young
or
james
burnes
the
statesman
with
the
silver
tongue
should
some
old
pioneer
take
sick
and
die
why
then
i
call
on
frank
posegate
for
the
life
and
posegate
knew
all
lon
tullar
used
to
pony
up
descriptions
that
were
tony
of
toilets
worn
at
party
ball
or
conversazione
for
the
ladies
were
addicted
to
the
style
called
deckolett
when
i
helped
run
the
local
on
the
jo
gazette
so
was
i
wont
my
daily
round
of
labor
to
pursue
and
when
came
night
i
found
that
there
was
still
more
work
to
do
the
telegraph
to
edit
yards
and
yards
of
proof
to
read
and
reprint
to
be
gathered
to
supply
the
printers
greed
oh
but
it
takes
agility
combined
with
versatility
to
run
a
country
daily
with
appropriate
ability
there
never
were
a
smarter
lot
of
editors
i
bet
than
we
who
whooped
up
local
on
the
jo
gazette
yes
maybe
it
was
irksome
maybe
a
discontent
rebellious
rose
amid
the
toil
i
daily
underwent
if
so
i
do
remember
this
only
do
i
know
my
thoughts
turn
ever
fondly
to
that
time
in
old
jo
the
years
that
speed
so
fleetly
have
blotted
out
completely
all
else
than
that
which
still
remains
to
solace
me
so
sweetly
the
friendships
of
that
time
ah
me
they
are
as
precious
yet
as
when
i
was
a
local
on
the
jo
gazette
in
amsterdam
meynheer
hans
von
der
bloom
has
got
a
majazin
in
kalverstraat
where
one
may
buy
for
sordid
gold
wares
quaint
and
curious
new
and
old
here
are
antiquities
galore
the
jewels
which
dutch
monarchs
wore
swords
teacups
helmets
platters
clocks
bright
dresden
jars
dull
holland
crocks
and
all
those
joys
i
might
rehearse
that
please
the
eye
but
wreck
the
purse
i
most
admired
an
ancient
bed
with
ornate
carvings
at
its
head
a
massive
frame
of
dingy
oak
whose
curious
size
and
mould
bespoke
prodigious
age
how
much
i
cried
ein
tousand
gildens
hans
replied
and
then
the
honest
dutchman
said
a
king
once
owned
that
glorious
bed
king
fritz
der
foorst
of
blessed
fame
had
owned
and
slept
within
the
same
then
long
i
stood
and
mutely
gazed
by
reminiscent
splendors
dazed
and
i
had
bought
it
right
away
had
i
the
wherewithal
to
pay
but
lacking
of
the
needed
pelf
i
thus
discoursed
within
myself
o
happy
holland
where
the
bliss
that
can
approximate
to
this
possession
of
the
rare
antique
which
maniacs
hanker
for
and
seek
native
land
is
full
of
stuff
that
good
but
is
not
old
enough
alas
it
has
no
oaken
beds
wherein
have
slumbered
royal
heads
no
relic
on
whose
face
we
see
the
proof
of
grand
antiquity
thus
reasoned
i
a
goodly
spell
until
perchance
my
vision
fell
upon
a
trademark
at
the
head
of
fritz
der
foorst
old
oaken
bed
a
rampant
wolverine
and
round
this
strange
device
these
words
i
found
patent
antique
birkey
gay
grand
rapids
michigan
s
a
at
present
i
not
saying
much
about
the
simple
guileless
dutch
and
as
it
were
a
loathsome
spot
i
keep
away
from
kalverstraat
determined
when
i
want
a
bed
in
which
hath
slept
a
royal
head
i
patronize
no
middleman
but
deal
direct
with
michigan
to
the
passing
saint
as
you
came
your
way
bearing
earthward
heavenly
joy
tell
me
o
dear
saint
i
pray
did
you
see
my
little
boy
by
some
fairer
voice
beguiled
once
he
wandered
from
my
sight
he
is
such
a
little
child
he
should
have
my
love
this
night
it
has
been
so
many
a
year
oh
so
many
a
year
since
then
yet
he
was
so
very
dear
surely
he
will
come
again
if
upon
your
way
you
see
one
whose
beauty
is
divine
will
you
send
him
back
to
me
he
is
lost
and
he
is
mine
tell
him
that
his
little
chair
nestles
where
the
sunbeams
meet
that
the
shoes
he
used
to
wear
yearn
to
kiss
his
dimpled
feet
tell
him
of
each
pretty
toy
that
was
wont
to
share
his
glee
maybe
that
will
bring
my
boy
back
to
them
and
back
to
me
o
dear
saint
as
on
you
go
through
the
glad
and
sparkling
frost
bid
those
bells
ring
high
and
low
for
a
little
child
that
lost
o
dear
saint
that
blessest
men
with
the
grace
of
christmas
joy
soothe
this
heart
with
love
again
give
me
back
my
little
boy
the
fisherman
feast
of
all
the
gracious
gifts
of
spring
is
there
another
can
surpass
this
delicate
voluptuous
thing
this
bass
upon
a
damask
napkin
laid
what
exhalations
superfine
our
gustatory
nerves
pervade
provoking
quenchless
thirsts
for
wine
the
ancients
loved
this
noble
fish
and
coming
from
the
kitchen
fire
all
piping
hot
upon
a
dish
what
raptures
did
he
not
inspire
fish
should
swim
twice
they
used
to
say
once
in
their
native
vapid
brine
and
then
again
a
better
way
you
understand
fetch
on
the
wine
ah
dainty
monarch
of
the
flood
how
often
have
i
cast
for
you
how
often
sadly
seen
you
scud
where
weeds
and
grew
how
often
have
you
filched
my
bait
how
often
snapped
my
treacherous
line
yet
here
i
have
you
on
this
plate
you
swim
twice
and
in
and
harkee
garçon
let
the
blood
of
cobwebbed
years
be
spilled
for
him
ay
in
a
rich
burgundian
flood
this
piscatorial
pride
should
swim
so
were
he
living
he
would
say
he
gladly
died
for
me
and
mine
and
as
it
were
his
native
spray
he
lash
the
sauce
what
ho
the
wine
i
would
it
were
ordained
for
me
to
share
your
fate
o
finny
friend
i
surely
were
not
loath
to
be
reserved
for
such
a
noble
end
for
when
old
chronos
gaunt
and
grim
at
last
reels
in
his
ruthless
line
what
were
my
ecstasy
to
swim
in
wine
in
wine
in
glorious
wine
well
here
a
health
to
you
sweet
spring
and
prithee
whilst
i
stick
to
earth
come
hither
every
year
and
bring
the
boons
provocative
of
mirth
and
should
your
stock
of
bass
run
low
however
much
i
might
repine
i
think
i
might
survive
the
blow
if
plied
with
wine
and
still
more
wine
nightfall
in
dordrecht
the
mill
goes
toiling
slowly
around
with
steady
and
solemn
creak
and
my
little
one
hears
in
the
kindly
sound
the
voice
of
the
old
mill
speak
while
round
and
round
those
big
white
wings
grimly
and
ghostlike
creep
my
little
one
hears
that
the
old
mill
sings
sleep
little
tulip
sleep
the
sails
are
reefed
and
the
nets
are
drawn
and
over
his
pot
of
beer
the
fisher
against
the
morrow
dawn
lustily
maketh
cheer
he
mocks
at
the
winds
that
caper
along
from
the
clamorous
deep
but
we
we
love
their
of
sleep
little
tulip
sleep
old
dog
fritz
in
slumber
sound
groans
of
the
stony
mart
how
proudly
he
trot
you
around
hitched
to
our
new
and
you
shall
help
me
blanket
the
kine
and
fold
the
gentle
sheep
and
set
the
herring
in
brine
but
now
little
tulip
sleep
a
comes
to
button
the
eyes
that
wearily
droop
and
blink
while
the
old
mill
buffets
the
frowning
skies
and
scolds
at
the
stars
that
wink
over
your
face
the
misty
wings
of
that
beautiful
sweep
and
rocking
your
cradle
she
softly
sings

the

of

there
be
a
thousand
kinds
so
versatile
the

and
as
we
all
have
different
minds
each
has
his
favorite
tart
but
those
which
most
delight
the

methinks
should
suit
me
not

grandma
bombazine
it
everywhere
that
women
fair
invite
and
please
my
eye
and
that
on
dress
i
lay
much
stress
i
ca
and
deny
the
english
dame
who
all
aflame
with
divers
colors
bright
the
teuton
belle
the
all
give
me
keen
delight
and
yet
i
say
go
where
i
may
i
never
yet
have
seen
a
dress
that
quite
as
grand
a
sight
as
was
that
bombazine
now
you
must
know
was
years
ago
this
quaint
but
noble
gown
flashed
in
one
day
the
usual
way
upon
our
solemn
town
was
fisk
who
sold
for
sordid
gold
that
gravely
scrumptious
thing
jim
fisk
the
man
who
drove
a
span
that
would
have
joyed
a
king
and
grandma
eye
fell
with
a
sigh
upon
that
sombre
sheen
and
grandpa
purse
looked
much
the
worse
for
grandma
bombazine
though
ten
years
old
i
never
told
the
neighbors
of
the
gown
for
grandma
said
this
secret
ned
must
not
be
breathed
in
town
the
for
days
of
gloom
was
in
a
dreadful
mess
when
that
quaint
dame
miss
kelsey
came
to
make
the
wondrous
dress
to
fit
and
baste
and
stitch
a
waist
with
in
between
is
precious
slow
as
all
folks
know
who
made
a
bombazine
with
fortitude
dear
grandma
stood
the
trial
to
the
end
the
nerve
we
find
in
womankind
i
can
not
comprehend
and
when
was
done
resolved
that
none
should
guess
at
the
surprise
within
the
press
she
hid
that
dress
secure
from
prying
eyes
for
grandma
knew
a
thing
or
two
by
which
remark
i
mean
that
sundays
were
the
days
for
her
to
wear
that
bombazine
i
need
not
state
she
got
there
late
and
sailing
up
the
aisle
with
regal
grace
on
grandma
face
reposed
a
conscious
smile
it
fitted
so
above
below
and
hung
so
well
all
round
that
there
was
not
one
faulty
spot
a
critic
could
have
found
how
proud
i
was
of
her
because
she
looked
so
like
a
queen
and
that
was
why
perhaps
that
i
admired
the
bombazine
but
there
those
as
you
suppose
who
scorned
that
perfect
gown
for
old
cats
obtained
in
that
new
england
town
the
widow
white
spat
out
her
spite
in
one
it
does
fit
the
packard
girls
they
wore
false
curls
all
giggled
like
to
split
sophronia
wade
the
sour
old
maid
turned
a
bilious
green
when
she
descried
that
joy
and
pride
my
grandma
bombazine
but
grandma
knew
and
i
did
too
that
gown
was
wondrous
fine
the
envious
sneers
and
jaundiced
jeers
were
a
conclusive
sign
why
grandpa
said
it
went
ahead
of
all
the
girls
in
town
and
saying
this
he
snatched
a
kiss
that
like
to
burst
that
gown
but
blushing
red
my
grandma
said
oh
is
grandpa
mean
yet
evermore
my
grandma
wore
favorite
bombazine
and
when
she
died
that
sombre
pride
passed
down
to
heedless
heirs
alas
the
day
was
hung
away
beneath
the
kitchen
stairs
thence
in
due
time
with
dust
and
grime
came
foes
on
foot
and
wing
and
made
their
nests
and
sped
their
guests
in
that
once
beauteous
thing
is
so
forsooth
time
envious
tooth
corrodes
each
human
scene
and
so
at
last
to
ruin
passed
my
grandma
bombazine
yet
to
this
day
i
proud
to
say
it
plays
a
grateful
part
the
thoughts
it
brings
are
of
such
things
as
touch
and
warm
my
heart
this
gown
my
dear
you
show
me
here
i
own
is
passing
fair
though
i
confess
it
no
such
dress
as
grandma
used
to
wear
yet
wear
it
perchance
when
you
and
i
are
off
the
scene
our
boy
shall
sing
comely
thing
as
the
bombazine
rare
roast
beef
when
the
numerous
distempers
to
which
all
flesh
is
heir
torment
us
till
our
very
souls
are
reeking
with
despair
when
that
monster
fiend
dyspepsy
rears
its
spectral
hydra
head
filling
and
epicures
with
certain
nameless
dread
when
ill
of
body
or
of
intellect
abounds
be
it
sickness
known
to
galen
or
disease
unknown
to
lowndes
in
such
a
dire
emergency
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
there
is
no
diet
quite
so
good
as
rare
roast
beef
and
even
when
the
body
in
the
very
prime
of
health
when
sweet
contentment
spreads
upon
the
cheeks
her
rosy
wealth
and
when
a
man
devours
three
meals
per
day
and
pines
for
more
and
growls
because
instead
of
three
square
meals
there
are
not
four
well
even
then
though
cake
and
pie
do
service
on
the
side
and
coffee
is
a
luxury
that
may
not
be
denied
still
of
the
many
viands
there
is
one
that
hailed
as
chief
and
that
as
you
are
well
aware
is
rare
roast
beef
some
like
the
sirloin
but
i
think
the
porterhouse
is
best
is
juicier
and
tenderer
and
meatier
than
the
rest
put
on
this
roast
a
dash
of
salt
and
then
of
water
pour
into
the
sizzling
a
cupful
and
no
more
the
oven
being
hot
the
roast
will
cook
in
half
an
hour
then
to
the
juices
in
the
pan
you
add
a
little
flour
and
so
you
get
a
gravy
that
is
called
the
cap
sheaf
of
that
glorious
rare
roast
beef
served
on
a
platter
that
is
hot
and
carved
with
thin
keen
knife
how
does
this
savory
viand
enhance
the
worth
of
life
give
me
no
thin
and
shadowy
slice
but
a
thick
and
steaming
slab
who
would
not
choose
a
generous
hunk
to
a
bloodless
little
dab
upon
a
nice
hot
plate
how
does
the
juicy
morceau
steam
a
symphony
in
scarlet
or
a
red
incarnate
dream
take
from
me
eyes
and
ears
and
all
o
time
thou
ruthless
thief
except
these
teeth
wherewith
to
deal
with
rare
roast
beef
most
every
kind
and
rôle
of
modern
victuals
have
i
tried
including
roasted
fricasseed
broiled
toasted
stewed
and
fried
your
canvasbacks
and
and
muttonchops
subese
your
patties
turkey
and
your
doughnuts
grease
i
whirled
away
dyspeptic
hours
with
crabs
in
marble
halls
and
in
the
lowly
cottage
i
experienced
codfish
balls
but
i
never
found
a
viand
that
could
so
allay
all
grief
and
soothe
the
cockles
of
the
heart
as
rare
roast
beef
i
honor
that
sagacious
king
who
in
a
grateful
mood
knighted
the
savory
loin
that
on
the
royal
table
stood
and
as
for
me
i
ask
no
better
friend
than
this
good
roast
which
is
my
squeamish
stomach
fortress
and
host
for
with
this
ally
with
me
i
can
mock
dyspepsy
wrath
can
i
pursue
the
joy
of
wisdom
pleasant
peaceful
path
so
i
do
off
my
vest
and
let
my
waistband
out
a
reef
when
i
soever
set
me
down
to
rare
roast
beef
ganderfeather
gift
i
was
just
a
little
thing
when
a
fairy
came
and
kissed
me
floating
in
upon
the
light
of
a
haunted
summer
night
lo
the
fairies
came
to
sing
pretty
slumber
songs
and
bring
certain
boons
that
else
had
missed
me
from
a
dream
i
turned
to
see
what
those
strangers
brought
for
me
when
that
fairy
up
and
kissed
me
here
upon
this
cheek
he
kissed
me
simmerdew
was
there
but
she
did
not
like
me
altogether
daisybright
and
turtledove
pilfercurds
and
honeylove
thistleblow
and
amberglee
on
that
gleaming
ghostly
sea
floated
from
the
misty
heather
and
around
my
frisked
and
looked
and
whispering
said
and
all
together
shall
kiss
him
ganderfeather
ganderfeather
kissed
me
then
ganderfeather
quaint
and
merry
no
attenuate
sprite
was
he
but
as
buxom
as
could
be
kissed
me
twice
and
once
again
and
the
others
shouted
when
on
my
cheek
uprose
a
berry
somewhat
like
a
mole
mayhap
but
the
of
that
chap
ganderfeather
passing
merry
humorsome
but
kindly
very
i
was
just
a
tiny
thing
when
the
prankish
ganderfeather
brought
this
curious
gift
to
me
with
his
fairy
kisses
three
yet
with
honest
pride
i
sing
that
same
gift
he
chose
to
bring
out
of
yonder
haunted
heather
other
charms
and
friendships
fly
constant
friends
this
mole
and
i
who
have
been
so
long
together
thank
you
little
ganderfeather
old
times
old
friends
old
love
there
are
no
days
like
the
good
old
days
the
days
when
we
were
youthful
when
humankind
were
pure
of
mind
and
speech
and
deeds
were
truthful
before
a
love
for
sordid
gold
became
man
ruling
passion
and
before
each
dame
and
maid
became
slave
to
the
tyrant
fashion
there
are
no
girls
like
the
good
old
girls
against
the
world
i
stake
as
buxom
and
smart
and
clean
of
heart
as
the
lord
knew
how
to
make
they
were
rich
in
spirit
and
and
piety
all
supportin
they
could
bake
and
brew
and
had
taught
school
too
and
they
made
such
likely
courtin
there
are
no
boys
like
the
good
old
boys
when
were
boys
together
when
the
grass
was
sweet
to
the
brown
bare
feet
that
dimpled
the
laughing
heather
when
the
pewee
sung
to
the
summer
dawn
of
the
bee
in
the
billowy
clover
or
down
by
the
mill
the
echoed
his
night
song
over
there
is
no
love
like
the
good
old
love
the
love
that
mother
gave
us
we
are
old
old
men
yet
we
pine
again
for
that
precious
grace
god
save
us
so
we
dream
and
dream
of
the
good
old
times
and
our
hearts
grow
tenderer
fonder
as
those
dear
old
dreams
bring
soothing
gleams
of
heaven
away
off
yonder
our
whippings
come
harvey
let
us
sit
awhile
and
talk
about
the
times
before
you
went
to
selling
clothes
and
i
to
peddling
rhymes
the
days
when
we
were
little
boys
as
naughty
little
boys
as
ever
worried
home
folks
with
their
everlasting
noise
egad
and
were
we
so
disposed
i
venture
we
could
show
the
scars
of
wallopings
we
got
some
forty
years
ago
what
wallopings
i
mean
i
think
i
need
not
specify
mother
whippings
did
hurt
but
father
oh
my
the
way
that
we
played
hookey
those
many
years
ago
we
rather
give
anything
than
have
our
children
know
the
thousand
naughty
things
we
did
the
thousand
fibs
we
told
why
thinking
of
them
makes
my
presbyterian
blood
run
cold
how
often
deacon
sabine
morse
remarked
if
we
were
his
he
tan
our
pesky
little
hides
until
the
blisters
riz
it
many
a
hearty
thrashing
to
that
deacon
morse
we
owe
mother
whippings
did
count
father
did
though
we
used
to
sneak
off
swimmin
in
those
careless
boyish
days
and
come
back
home
of
evenings
with
our
necks
and
backs
ablaze
how
mother
used
to
wonder
why
our
clothes
were
full
of
sand
but
father
having
been
a
boy
appeared
to
understand
and
after
tea
he
beckon
us
to
join
him
in
the
shed
where
he
proceed
to
tinge
our
backs
a
deeper
darker
red
say
what
we
will
of
mother
there
is
none
will
controvert
the
proposition
that
our
father
lickings
always
hurt
for
mother
was
by
nature
so
forgiving
and
so
mild
that
she
inclined
to
spare
the
rod
although
she
spoiled
the
child
and
when
at
last
in
she
had
to
whip
us
she
appeared
to
feel
those
whippings
a
great
deal
more
than
we
but
how
we
bellowed
and
took
on
as
if
we
like
to
die
poor
mother
really
thought
she
hurt
and
that
what
made
cry
then
how
we
youngsters
snickered
as
out
the
door
we
slid
for
mother
whippings
never
hurt
though
father
always
did
in
after
years
poor
father
simmered
down
to
five
feet
four
but
in
our
youth
he
seemed
to
us
in
height
eight
feet
or
more
oh
how
we
shivered
when
he
quoth
in
cold
suggestive
tone
i
see
you
in
the
woodshed
after
supper
all
alone
oh
how
the
legs
and
arms
and
dust
and
flew
what
florid
vocalisms
marked
that
vesper
interview
yes
after
all
this
lapse
of
years
i
feelingly
assert
with
all
respect
to
mother
it
was
father
whippings
hurt
the
little
boy
experiencing
that
tingling
his
vest
is
often
loath
to
realize
that
all
is
for
the
best
yet
when
the
boy
gets
older
he
pictures
with
delight
the
bufferings
of
childhood
as
we
do
here
the
years
the
gracious
years
have
smoothed
and
beautified
the
ways
that
to
our
little
feet
seemed
all
too
rugged
in
the
days
before
you
went
to
selling
clothes
and
i
to
peddling
rhymes
so
harvey
let
us
sit
awhile
and
think
upon
those
times
bion
song
of
eros
eros
is
the
god
of
love
he
and
i
are
all
the
gentle
gracious
muses
follow
eros
where
he
leads
and
they
bless
the
bard
who
chooses
to
proclaim
love
famous
deeds
him
they
serve
in
rapturous
glee
that
is
why
they
good
to
me
sometimes
i
have
gone
astray
from
love
sunny
flowery
way
how
i
floundered
how
i
stuttered
and
deprived
of
ways
and
means
what
egregious
rot
i
uttered
such
as
suits
the
magazines
i
was
rescued
only
when
eros
called
me
back
again
gods
forefend
that
i
should
shun
that
benignant
mother
son
why
the
poet
who
refuses
to
emblazon
love
delights
gets
the
mitten
from
the
muses
then
what
balderdash
he
writes
i
love
love
which
being
so
see
how
smooth
my
verses
flow
gentle
eros
lead
the
way
i
will
follow
while
i
may
be
thy
path
by
hill
or
hollow
i
will
follow
fast
and
free
and
when
i
too
old
to
follow
i
will
sit
and
sing
of
thee
potent
still
in
intellect
sit
and
sing
and
retrospect
billings
of
louisville
there
are
times
in
one
life
which
one
can
not
forget
and
the
time
i
remember
the
evening
i
met
a
haughty
young
scion
of
bluegrass
renown
who
made
my
acquaintance
while
painting
the
town
a
handshake
a
cocktail
a
smoker
and
then
billings
of
louisville
touched
me
for
ten
there
flowed
in
his
veins
the
blue
blood
of
the
south
and
a
cynical
smile
curled
his
sensuous
mouth
he
quoted
from
lanier
and
poe
by
the
yard
but
his
purse
had
been
hit
by
the
war
and
hit
hard
i
felt
that
he
honored
and
flattered
me
when
billings
of
louisville
touched
me
for
ten
i
wonder
that
never
again
since
that
night
a
vision
of
billings
has
hallowed
my
sight
i
pine
for
the
sound
of
his
voice
and
the
thrill
that
comes
with
the
touch
of
a
bill
i
wonder
and
pine
for
i
say
it
again
billings
of
louisville
touched
me
for
ten
i
heard
what
old
whittier
sung
of
miss
maud
but
all
such
philosophy
nothing
but
fraud
to
one
who
a
bear
in
chicago
with
wheat
going
up
and
the
devil
to
pay
these
words
are
the
saddest
of
tongue
or
of
pen
billings
of
louisville
touched
me
for
ten
poet
and
king
though
i
am
king
i
have
no
throne
save
this
rough
wooden
siege
alone
i
have
no
empire
yet
my
sway
extends
a
myriad
leagues
away
no
servile
vassal
bends
his
knee
in
grovelling
reverence
to
me
yet
at
my
word
all
hearts
beat
high
and
there
is
fire
in
every
eye
and
love
and
gratitude
they
bring
as
tribute
unto
me
a
king
the
folk
that
throng
the
busy
street
know
not
it
is
a
king
they
meet
and
i
am
glad
there
is
not
seen
the
monarch
in
my
face
and
mien
i
should
not
choose
to
be
the
cause
of
fawning
or
of
coarse
applause
i
am
content
to
know
the
arts
wherewith
to
lord
it
their
hearts
for
when
unto
their
hearts
i
sing
i
am
a
king
i
am
a
king
my
sceptre
see
it
is
a
pen
wherewith
i
rule
these
hearts
of
men
sometime
it
pleaseth
to
beguile
its
monarch
fancy
with
a
smile
sometime
it
is
athirst
for
tears
and
so
adown
the
laurelled
years
i
walk
the
noblest
lord
on
earth
dispensing
sympathy
and
mirth
aha
it
is
a
magic
thing
that
makes
me
what
i
am
a
king
let
empires
crumble
as
they
may
proudly
i
hold
imperial
sway
the
sunshine
and
the
rain
of
years
are
human
smiles
and
human
tears
that
come
or
vanish
at
my
call
i
am
the
monarch
of
them
all
mindful
alone
of
this
am
i
the
songs
i
sing
shall
never
die
not
even
envious
death
can
wring
his
glory
from
so
great
a
king
come
brother
be
a
king
with
me
and
rule
mankind
eternally
lift
up
the
weak
and
cheer
the
strong
defend
the
truth
combat
the
wrong
you
find
no
sceptre
like
the
pen
to
hold
and
sway
the
hearts
of
men
its
edicts
flow
in
blood
and
tears
that
will
outwash
the
flood
of
years
so
brother
sing
your
songs
oh
sing
and
be
with
me
a
king
a
king
lydia
dick
when
i
was
a
boy
at
college
filling
up
with
classic
knowledge
frequently
i
wondered
why
old
professor
demas
bentley
used
to
praise
so
eloquently
opera
horatii
toiling
on
a
season
longer
till
my
reasoning
powers
got
stronger
as
my
observation
grew
i
became
convinced
that
mellow
poet
fellow
horace
knew
a
thing
or
two
yes
we
sophomores
figured
duly
that
if
we
appraised
him
truly
horace
must
have
been
a
brick
and
no
wonder
that
with
ranting
rhymes
he
went
round
with
sprightly
lydia
dick
for
that
pink
of
female
gender
tall
and
shapely
was
and
slender
plump
of
neck
and
bust
and
arms
while
the
raiment
that
invested
her
so
jealously
suggested
certain
more
potential
charms
those
dark
eyes
of
hers
that
fired
him
those
sweet
accents
that
inspired
him
and
her
crown
of
glorious
hair
these
things
baffle
my
description
i
should
have
a
fit
conniption
if
i
tried
so
i
forbear
maybe
lydia
had
her
betters
anyway
this
man
of
letters
took
that
charmer
as
his
pick
glad
yes
glad
i
am
to
know
it
i
a
de
poet
sympathize
with
lydia
dick
often
in
my
arbor
shady
i
fall
thinking
of
that
lady
and
the
pranks
she
used
to
play
and
i
cheered
for
all
we
sages
joy
when
from
those
distant
ages
lydia
dances
down
our
way
otherwise
some
folks
might
wonder
with
good
reason
why
in
thunder
learned
professors
dry
and
prim
find
such
solace
in
the
giddy
pranks
that
horace
played
with
liddy
or
that
liddy
played
on
him
still
this
world
of
ours
rejoices
in
those
ancient
singing
voices
and
our
hearts
beat
high
and
quick
to
the
cadence
of
old
tiber
murmuring
praise
of
roistering
liber
and
of
charming
lydia
dick
still
digentia
downward
flowing
prattleth
to
the
roses
blowing
by
the
dark
deserted
grot
still
soracte
looming
lonely
watcheth
for
the
coming
only
of
a
ghost
that
cometh
not
lizzie
i
wonder
ef
all
wimmin
air
like
lizzie
is
when
we
go
out
to
theaters
an
concerts
where
is
things
the
papers
talk
about
do
other
wimmin
fret
an
stew
like
they
wuz
bein
crucified
frettin
a
show
or
concert
through
with
wonderin
ef
the
baby
cried
now
lizzie
knows
that
there
to
see
that
everything
is
right
yet
lizzie
thinks
that
care
ai
good
enuff
baby
quite
yet
what
am
i
to
answer
when
she
kind
uv
fidgets
at
my
side
an
asks
me
every
now
an
then
i
wonder
ef
the
baby
cried
seems
like
she
seen
two
little
eyes
their
mother
smile
seems
like
she
heern
the
pleadin
cries
uv
one
she
thinks
uv
all
the
while
an
so
she
sorry
that
she
come
an
though
she
allus
tries
to
hide
the
truth
she
ruther
stay
to
hum
than
wonder
ef
the
baby
cried
yes
wimmin
folks
is
all
alike
by
lizzie
you
kin
jedge
the
rest
there
never
wuz
a
little
tyke
but
that
his
mother
loved
him
best
and
nex
to
bein
what
i
be
the
husband
uv
my
gentle
bride
i
wisht
i
wuz
that
croodlin
wee
with
lizzie
wonderin
ef
i
cried
little
homer
slate
after
dear
old
grandma
died
hunting
through
an
oaken
chest
in
the
attic
we
espied
what
repaid
our
childish
quest
was
a
homely
little
slate
seemingly
of
ancient
date
on
its
quaint
and
battered
face
was
the
picture
of
a
cart
drawn
with
all
that
awkward
grace
which
betokens
childish
art
but
what
meant
this
legend
pray
homer
drew
this
yesterday
mother
recollected
then
what
the
years
were
fain
to
hide
she
was
but
a
baby
when
little
homer
lived
and
died
forty
years
so
mother
said
little
homer
had
been
dead
this
one
secret
through
those
years
grandma
kept
from
all
apart
hallowed
by
her
lonely
tears
and
the
breaking
of
her
heart
while
each
year
that
sped
away
seemed
to
her
but
yesterday
so
the
homely
little
slate
grandma
baby
fingers
pressed
to
a
memory
consecrate
lieth
in
the
oaken
chest
where
unwilling
we
should
know
grandma
put
it
years
ago
always
right
do
take
on
so
hiram
but
do
what
you
told
to
do
it
fair
to
suppose
that
yer
mother
knows
a
heap
sight
more
than
you
i
allow
that
sometimes
way
do
seem
the
wisest
quite
but
the
way
when
she
had
her
say
is
to
reckon
yer
mother
is
right
courted
her
ten
long
winters
saw
her
to
when
she
went
down
one
spell
to
town
i
cried
like
a
durned
ol
fool
got
mad
at
the
boys
for
when
i
sparked
her
sunday
night
but
she
said
she
knew
a
thing
or
two
an
i
reckoned
yer
mother
wuz
right
i
courted
till
i
wuz
aging
and
she
wuz
past
her
prime
i
have
died
i
guess
if
she
had
said
yes
when
i
popped
the
hundredth
time
said
she
never
have
took
me
if
i
had
stuck
so
tight
opined
that
we
could
never
agree
and
i
reckon
yer
mother
wuz
right
trot
my
good
steed
trot
where
my
true
love
abideth
i
make
my
way
lo
waiting
she
espieth
me
and
calleth
in
delight
i
see
his
steed
anear
come
trotting
with
my
dear
oh
idle
not
good
steed
but
trot
trot
thou
my
lover
here
aloose
i
cast
the
bridle
and
ply
the
whip
and
spur
and
gayly
i
speed
this
reply
while
faring
on
to
her
oh
true
love
fear
thou
not
i
seek
our
trysting
spot
and
double
feed
be
yours
my
steed
if
you
more
swiftly
trot
i
vault
from
out
the
saddle
and
make
my
good
steed
fast
then
to
my
breast
my
love
is
pressed
at
last
true
heart
at
last
the
garden
drowsing
lies
the
stars
fold
down
their
eyes
in
this
dear
spot
my
steed
neigh
not
nor
stamp
in
restless
wise
o
passing
sweet
communion
of
young
hearts
warm
and
true
to
thee
belongs
the
old
old
songs
love
finds
forever
new
we
sing
those
songs
and
then
cometh
the
moment
when
it
good
steed
trot
from
this
dear
spot
trot
trot
me
home
again
providence
and
the
dog
when
i
was
young
and
callow
which
was
many
years
ago
within
me
the
afflatus
went
surging
to
and
fro
and
so
i
wrote
a
tragedy
that
fairly
reeked
with
gore
with
every
act
concluding
with
the
dead
piled
on
the
floor
a
mighty
effort
by
the
gods
and
after
i
had
read
the
manuscript
to
daly
that
dramatic
censor
said
the
plot
is
most
exciting
and
i
like
the
dialogue
you
should
take
the
thing
to
providence
and
try
it
on
a
dog
mccambridge
organized
a
troupe
including
many
a
name
unknown
alike
to
guileless
me
to
riches
and
to
fame
a
pompous
man
whose
name
was
rae
was
nestor
of
this
troupe
amphibious
he
was
quite
at
home
outside
or
in
the
soup
the
way
mccambridge
billed
him
why
such
dreams
in
red
and
green
had
before
upon
the
boards
of
yankeedom
been
seen
and
my
proud
name
was
heralded
oh
that
i
gone
incog
when
we
took
that
play
to
providence
to
try
it
on
a
dog
shall
i
forget
the
awful
day
we
struck
that
wretched
town
yet
in
what
melting
irony
the
treacherous
sun
beamed
down
the
sale
of
seats
had
not
been
large
but
then
mccambridge
said
the
factory
people
seldom
bought
their
seats
so
far
ahead
and
rae
indorsed
mccambridge
so
they
partly
set
at
rest
the
natural
misgivings
that
perturbed
my
youthful
breast
for
i
wondered
and
lamented
that
the
town
was
not
agog
when
i
took
my
play
to
providence
to
try
it
on
a
dog
they
never
came
at
all
aha
i
knew
it
all
the
time
they
never
came
to
see
and
hear
my
tragedy
sublime
oh
fateful
moment
when
the
curtain
rose
on
act
the
first
oh
moment
fateful
to
the
soul
for
wealth
and
fame
athirst
but
lucky
factory
girls
and
boys
to
stay
away
that
night
when
the
author
fervid
soul
was
touched
by
blight
when
desolation
settled
down
on
me
like
some
dense
fog
for
having
tempted
providence
and
tried
it
on
a
dog
those
actors
did
know
their
parts
they
maundered
to
and
fro
ejaculating
platitudes
that
were
quite
à
and
when
i
sought
to
reprimand
the
graceless
scamps
the
lot
turned
fiercely
on
me
and
denounced
my
charming
play
as
rot
i
might
have
stood
their
bitter
taunts
without
a
passing
grunt
if
i
had
a
word
of
solace
from
the
people
out
in
front
but
that
chilly
corporal
guard
sat
round
like
bumps
upon
a
log
when
i
played
that
play
at
providence
with
designs
upon
the
dog
we
went
with
lots
of
baggage
but
we
did
bring
it
back
for
who
would
be
so
hampered
as
he
walks
a
railway
track
oh
ruthless
muse
of
tragedy
what
prodigies
of
shame
what
marvels
of
injustice
are
committed
in
thy
name
thus
groaned
i
in
the
spirit
as
i
strode
what
stretch
of
ties
providence
rhode
island
and
my
native
gotham
lies
but
rae
mccambridge
and
the
rest
kept
up
a
steady
jog
was
not
the
first
time
they
had
plied
their
arts
upon
the
dog
so
much
for
my
first
battle
with
the
fickle
goddess
fame
and
i
hear
that
some
folks
nowadays
are
faring
just
the
same
oh
hapless
he
that
on
the
graceless
yankee
dog
relies
the
dog
fares
stout
and
hearty
and
the
play
it
is
that
dies
so
ye
with
tragedies
to
try
i
beg
of
you
beware
put
not
your
trust
in
providence
that
most
delusive
snare
cast
if
you
will
your
pearls
of
thought
before
the
western
hog
but
never
go
to
providence
to
try
it
on
a
dog
gettin
on
when
i
wuz
somewhat
younger
i
wuz
reckoned
purty
gay
i
had
my
fling
at
everything
in
a
rollickin
coltish
way
but
times
have
strangely
altered
since
sixty
years
ago
this
age
of
steam
an
things
do
seem
like
the
age
i
used
to
know
your
modern
innovations
do
suit
me
i
confess
as
did
the
ways
of
the
good
ol
days
but
i
gettin
on
i
guess
i
set
on
the
piazza
an
hitch
round
with
the
sun
sometimes
mayhap
i
take
a
nap
waitin
till
school
is
done
an
then
i
tell
the
children
the
things
i
done
in
youth
an
near
as
i
can
as
a
man
i
stick
to
the
honest
truth
but
the
looks
of
them
listen
seem
sometimes
to
express
the
remote
idee
that
i
gone
you
see
an
i
gettin
on
i
guess
i
get
up
in
the
mornin
an
nothin
else
to
do
before
the
rest
are
up
an
dressed
i
read
the
papers
through
i
hang
round
with
the
women
all
day
an
hear
talk
an
while
they
sew
or
knit
i
show
the
baby
how
to
walk
an
somehow
i
feel
sorry
when
they
put
away
his
dress
an
cut
his
curls
they
like
a
girl
i
gettin
on
i
guess
sometimes
with
twilight
round
me
i
see
or
seem
to
see
a
distant
shore
where
friends
of
yore
linger
an
watch
for
me
sometimes
i
heered
so
low
that
it
almost
seemed
like
a
dream
i
dreamed
or
an
echo
of
long
ago
an
sometimes
on
my
forehead
there
falls
a
soft
caress
or
the
touch
of
a
hand
you
understand
i
gettin
on
i
guess
the
schnellest
zug
from
hanover
to
leipzig
is
but
a
little
way
yet
the
journey
by
the
schnellest
zug
consumes
a
day
you
start
at
ten
or
so
and
not
till
nearly
night
do
the
double
towers
of
magdeburg
loom
up
before
your
sight
from
thence
to
leipzig
quick
enough
of
that
i
not
complain
but
from
hanover
to
magdeburg
confound
that
schnellest
train
the
germans
say
that
schnell
means
fast
and
schnellest
faster
yet
in
all
my
life
no
grimmer
bit
of
humor
have
i
met
why
thirteen
miles
an
hour
the
greatest
speed
they
ever
go
while
on
the
engine
do
moss
and
lichens
grow
and
yet
the
average
teuton
will
presumptuously
maintain
that
one
know
what
swiftness
is
till
he
tried
das
schnellest
train
fool
that
i
was
i
should
have
walked
i
had
no
time
to
waste
the
little
journey
i
had
planned
i
had
to
do
in
haste
the
quaint
old
town
of
leipzig
with
its
literary
mart
and
dresden
with
its
and
wondrous
wealth
of
art
the
saxon
alps
the
carlsbad
cure
for
all
dyspeptic
pain
these
were
the
ends
i
had
in
view
when
i
took
that
schnellest
train
the
natives
dozed
around
me
yet
none
too
deep
to
hear
the
guard
sporadic
shout
of
funf
minuten
meaning
beer
i
counted
forty
times
at
least
that
voice
announce
the
stops
required
of
those
fat
natives
to
glut
their
greed
for
hops
whilst
crouched
in
a
corner
a
monument
to
woe
and
thought
unholy
awful
things
and
felt
my
whiskers
grow
and
then
the
wretched
sights
one
sees
while
travelling
by
that
train
the
women
doing
work
at
harvesting
the
grain
or
sometimes
grubbing
in
the
soil
or
hitched
to
heavy
carts
beside
the
family
cow
or
dog
doing
their
slavish
parts
the
husbands
strut
in
soldier
garb
indeed
were
too
vain
to
let
creation
see
work
from
that
creeping
schnellest
train
i
found
the
german
language
all
too
feeble
to
convey
the
sentiments
that
surged
through
my
dyspeptic
hulk
that
day
i
had
recourse
to
english
and
exploded
without
stint
such
virile
as
would
never
do
in
print
but
which
assuaged
my
rising
gorge
and
cooled
my
seething
brain
while
snailing
on
to
magdeburg
upon
that
schnellest
train
the
typical
new
england
freight
that
maunders
to
and
fro
the
upper
mississippi
boats
the
bumptious
b
the
creeping
southern
railroads
with
their
other
creeping
things
the
philadelphy
cable
that
is
run
out
west
for
rings
the
piccadilly
with
their
constant
roll
and
shake
all
have
i
tried
and
yet
i
give
the
schnellest
zug
the
cake
my
countrymen
if
ever
you
should
seek
the
german
clime
put
not
your
trust
in
baedeker
if
you
are
pressed
for
time
from
hanover
to
magdeburg
is
many
a
weary
mile
by
schnellest
zug
but
done
afoot
it
seems
a
tiny
while
walk
swim
or
skate
and
then
the
task
will
not
appear
in
vain
but
you
break
the
third
commandment
if
you
take
the
schnellest
train
as
i
was
going
to
upon
the
earth
i
cast
me
down
all
underneath
a
little
tree
that
whispered
in
this
wise
to
me
oh
i
shall
stand
on
calvary
and
bear
what
burthen
saveth
thee
as
up
i
fared
to
i
met
a
shepherd
coming
down
and
thus
he
quoth
a
wondrous
sight
hath
spread
before
mine
eyes
this
night
an
angel
host
most
fair
to
see
that
sung
full
sweetly
of
a
tree
that
shall
uplift
on
calvary
what
burthen
saveth
you
and
me
and
as
i
gat
to
lo
wise
men
came
that
bore
a
crown
is
there
cried
i
in
bethlehem
a
king
shall
wear
this
diadem
good
sooth
they
quoth
and
it
is
he
that
shall
be
lifted
on
the
tree
and
freely
shed
on
calvary
what
blood
redeemeth
us
and
thee
unto
a
child
in
the
wise
men
came
and
brought
the
crown
and
while
the
infant
smiling
slept
upon
their
knees
they
fell
and
wept
but
with
her
babe
upon
her
knee
naught
recked
that
mother
of
the
tree
that
should
uplift
on
calvary
what
burthen
saveth
all
and
me
again
i
walk
in
and
think
on
him
that
wears
the
crown
i
may
not
kiss
his
feet
again
nor
worship
him
as
did
i
then
my
king
hath
died
upon
the
tree
and
hath
outpoured
on
calvary
what
blood
redeemeth
you
and
me
the
peace
of
dearest
how
hard
it
is
to
say
that
all
is
for
the
best
since
sometimes
in
a
grievous
way
god
will
is
manifest
see
with
what
hearty
noisy
glee
our
little
ones
dance
round
and
round
our
with
pretty
toys
bedight
dearest
one
voice
they
may
not
hear
one
face
they
may
not
see
ah
what
of
all
this
christmas
cheer
cometh
to
you
and
me
cometh
before
our
misty
eyes
that
other
little
face
and
we
clasp
in
tender
reverent
wise
that
love
in
the
old
embrace
dearest
the
walks
bringing
his
peace
to
men
and
he
bringeth
to
you
and
to
me
the
light
of
the
old
old
years
again
bringeth
the
peace
of
long
ago
when
a
wee
one
clasped
your
knee
and
lisped
of
the
morrow
dear
one
you
know
and
here
come
back
is
he
dearest
is
sometimes
hard
to
say
that
all
is
for
the
best
for
often
in
a
grievous
way
god
will
is
manifest
but
in
the
grace
of
this
holy
night
that
bringeth
us
back
our
child
let
us
see
that
the
ways
of
god
are
right
and
so
be
reconciled
the
doings
of
delsarte
in
former
times
my
numerous
rhymes
excited
general
mirth
and
i
was
then
of
all
good
men
the
merriest
man
on
earth
and
my
career
from
year
to
year
was
full
of
cheer
and
things
despite
a
few
regrets
perdieu
which
grim
dyspepsia
brings
but
now
how
strange
and
harsh
a
change
has
come
upon
the
scene
horrors
appall
the
life
where
all
was
formerly
so
serene
yes
wasting
care
hath
cast
its
snare
about
my
honest
heart
because
alas
it
hath
come
to
pass
my
daughter
learned
delsarte
in
flesh
and
joint
and
every
point
the
counterpart
of
me
she
grew
so
fast
she
grew
at
last
a
marvellous
thing
to
see
long
gaunt
and
slim
each
gangling
limb
played
to
the
which
excess
of
awkwardness
quite
mortified
her
mother
now
as
for
me
i
like
to
see
the
carriages
uncouth
which
certify
to
all
the
shy
unconscious
age
of
youth
if
maidenkind
be
pure
of
mind
industrious
tidy
smart
what
need
that
they
should
fool
away
their
youth
upon
delsarte
in
good
old
times
my
numerous
rhymes
occasioned
general
mirth
but
now
you
see
revealed
in
me
the
gloomiest
bard
on
earth
i
sing
no
more
of
the
joys
of
yore
that
marked
my
happy
life
but
rather
those
depressing
woes
with
which
the
present
rife
unreconciled
to
that
gaunt
child
who
now
a
one
song
i
raise
in
art
dispraise
and
so
do
i
fight
with
fate
this
gangling
bard
has
found
it
hard
to
see
his
counterpart
long
loose
and
slim
divorced
from
him
by
that
hectic
dude
delsarte
she
goes
she
loves
to
pose
in
classic
attitudes
and
droop
her
eyes
in
languid
wise
and
feign
abstracted
moods
and
she
my
child
who
all
so
wild
so
helpless
and
so
sweet
that
once
she
knew
not
what
to
do
with
those
great
big
hands
and
feet
now
comes
and
goes
with
such
repose
so
calmly
sits
or
stands
is
so
discreet
with
both
her
feet
so
deft
with
both
her
hands
why
when
i
see
that
satire
on
me
i
give
an
angry
start
and
i
utter
one
word
it
is
commonly
heard
derogatory
to
delsarte
in
years
gone
by
was
said
that
i
was
quite
a
scrumptious
man
conceit
galore
had
i
before
this
delsarte
craze
began
but
now
these
wise
folks
criticise
my
figure
and
my
face
and
i
opine
they
even
incline
to
sneer
at
my
musical
bass
why
sometimes
they
presume
to
say
this
wart
upon
my
cheek
is
not
refined
and
remarks
unkind
they
pass
on
that
antique
with
lusty
bass
and
charms
of
face
and
figure
will
i
part
ere
they
extort
this
grand
old
wart
to
placat
their
delsarte
oh
wretched
day
as
all
shall
say
who
known
my
muse
before
when
by
this
rhyme
you
see
that
i
not
in
it
any
more
the
mirth
that
over
earth
diffused
such
keen
delight
the
bard
of
pork
and
lard
is
plainly
out
of
sight
all
withered
now
about
his
brow
the
laurel
fillets
droop
while
lachesis
brews
for
the
poor
old
muse

portion
of
scalding

buttercup
poppy
these
three
bloomed
in
a
garden
spot
and
once
all
merry
with
song
and
play
a
little
one
heard
three
voices
say
shine
or
shadow
summer
or
spring
o
thou
child
with
the
tangled
hair
and
laughing
eyes
we
three
shall
bring
each
an
offering
passing
fair
the
little
one
did
not
understand
but
they
bent
and
kissed
the
dimpled
hand
buttercup
gambolled
all
day
long
sharing
the
little
one
mirth
and
song
then
stealing
along
on
misty
gleams
poppy
came
bringing
the
sweetest
dreams
playing
and
dreaming
that
was
all
till
once
the
sleeper
would
not
awake
kissing
the
little
face
under
the
pall
we
thought
of
the
words
the
third
flower
spake
and
we
found
betimes
in
a
hallowed
spot
the
solace
and
peace
of
buttercup
shareth
the
joy
of
day
glinting
with
gold
the
hours
of
play
bringeth
the
poppy
sweet
repose
when
the
hands
would
fold
and
the
eyes
would
close
and
after
it
all
the
play
and
the
sleep
of
a
little
life
what
cometh
then
to
the
hearts
that
ache
and
the
eyes
that
weep
a
wee
flower
bringeth
god
peace
again
each
one
serveth
its
tender
lot
