i
have
heard
the
pigeons
of
the
seven
woods
make
their
faint
thunder
and
the
garden
bees
hum
in
the
lime
tree
flowers
and
put
away
the
unavailing
outcries
and
the
old
bitterness
that
empty
the
heart
i
have
forgot
awhile
tara
uprooted
and
new
commonness
upon
the
throne
and
crying
about
the
streets
and
hanging
its
paper
flowers
from
post
to
post
because
it
is
alone
of
all
things
happy
i
am
contented
for
i
know
that
quiet
wanders
laughing
and
eating
her
wild
heart
among
pigeons
and
bees
while
that
great
archer
who
but
awaits
his
hour
to
shoot
still
hangs
a
cloudy
quiver
over
august
the
old
age
of
queen
maeve
maeve
the
great
queen
was
pacing
to
and
fro
between
the
walls
covered
with
beaten
bronze
in
her
high
house
at
cruachan
the
long
hearth
flickering
with
ash
and
hazel
but
half
showed
where
the
tired
lay
upon
the
rushes
or
on
the
benches
underneath
the
walls
in
comfortable
sleep
all
living
slept
but
that
great
queen
who
more
than
half
the
night
had
paced
from
door
to
fire
and
fire
to
door
though
now
in
her
old
age
in
her
young
age
she
had
been
beautiful
in
that
old
way
that
all
but
gone
for
the
proud
heart
is
gone
and
the
fool
heart
of
the
fears
all
but
soft
beauty
and
indolent
desire
she
could
have
called
over
the
rim
of
the
world
whatever
woman
lover
had
hit
her
fancy
and
yet
had
been
great
bodied
and
great
limbed
fashioned
to
be
the
mother
of
strong
children
and
she
had
lucky
eyes
and
a
high
heart
and
wisdom
that
caught
fire
like
the
dried
flax
at
need
and
made
her
beautiful
and
fierce
sudden
and
laughing
o
unquiet
heart
why
do
you
praise
another
praising
her
as
if
there
were
no
tale
but
your
own
tale
worth
knitting
to
a
measure
of
sweet
sound
have
i
not
bid
you
tell
of
that
great
queen
who
has
been
buried
some
two
thousand
years
when
night
was
at
its
deepest
a
wild
goose
cried
from
the
porter
lodge
and
with
long
clamour
shook
the
ale
horns
and
shields
upon
their
hooks
but
the
slept
on
as
though
some
power
had
filled
the
house
with
druid
heaviness
and
wondering
who
of
the
many
changing
sidhe
had
come
as
in
the
old
times
to
counsel
her
maeve
walked
yet
with
slow
footfall
being
old
to
that
small
chamber
by
the
outer
gate
the
porter
slept
although
he
sat
upright
with
still
and
stony
limbs
and
open
eyes
maeve
waited
and
when
that
noise
broke
from
his
parted
lips
and
broke
again
she
laid
a
hand
on
either
of
his
shoulders
and
shook
him
wide
awake
and
bid
him
say
who
of
the
wandering
ones
had
troubled
his
sleep
but
all
he
had
to
say
was
that
the
air
being
heavy
and
the
dogs
more
still
than
they
had
been
for
a
good
month
he
had
fallen
asleep
and
though
he
had
dreamed
nothing
he
could
remember
when
he
had
had
fine
dreams
it
was
before
the
time
of
the
great
war
over
the
bull
and
the
brown
bull
she
turned
away
he
turned
again
to
sleep
that
no
god
troubled
now
and
wondering
what
matters
were
afoot
among
the
sidhe
maeve
walked
through
that
great
hall
and
with
a
sigh
lifted
the
curtain
of
her
sleeping
room
remembering
that
she
too
had
seemed
divine
to
many
thousand
eyes
and
to
her
own
one
that
the
generations
had
long
waited
that
work
too
difficult
for
mortal
hands
might
be
accomplished
bunching
the
curtain
up
she
saw
her
husband
ailell
sleeping
there
and
thought
of
days
when
he
had
a
straight
body
and
of
that
famous
fergus
nessa
husband
who
had
been
the
lover
of
her
middle
life
suddenly
ailell
spoke
out
of
his
sleep
and
not
with
his
own
voice
or
a
man
voice
but
with
the
burning
live
unshaken
voice
of
those
that
it
may
be
can
never
age
he
said
queen
of
cruachan
and
mag
ai
a
king
of
the
great
plain
would
speak
with
you
and
with
glad
voice
maeve
answered
him
king
of
the
far
wandering
shadows
has
come
to
me
as
in
the
old
days
when
they
would
come
and
go
about
my
threshold
to
counsel
and
to
help
the
parted
lips
replied
seek
your
help
for
i
am
aengus
and
i
am
crossed
in
love
may
a
mortal
whose
life
gutters
out
help
them
that
wander
with
hand
clasping
hand
by
rivers
where
nor
rain
nor
hail
has
dimmed
their
haughty
images
that
can
not
fade
although
their
beauty
like
a
hollow
dream
come
from
the
undimmed
rivers
to
bid
you
call
the
children
of
the
maines
out
of
sleep
and
set
them
digging
into
anbual
hill
we
shadows
while
they
uproot
his
earthy
house
will
overthrow
his
shadows
and
carry
off
caer
his
blue
eyed
daughter
that
i
love
i
helped
your
fathers
when
they
built
these
walls
and
i
would
have
your
help
in
my
great
need
queen
of
high
cruachan
obey
your
will
with
speedy
feet
and
a
most
thankful
heart
for
you
have
been
o
aengus
of
the
birds
our
giver
of
good
counsel
and
good
luck
and
with
a
groan
as
if
the
mortal
breath
could
but
awaken
sadly
upon
lips
that
happier
breath
had
moved
her
husband
turned
face
downward
tossing
in
a
troubled
sleep
but
maeve
and
not
with
a
slow
feeble
foot
came
to
the
threshold
of
the
painted
house
where
her
grandchildren
slept
and
cried
aloud
until
the
pillared
dark
began
to
stir
with
shouting
and
the
clang
of
unhooked
arms
she
told
them
of
the
ones
and
all
that
night
and
all
through
the
next
day
to
middle
night
they
dug
into
the
hill
at
middle
night
great
cats
with
silver
claws
bodies
of
shadow
and
blind
eyes
like
pearls
came
up
out
of
the
hole
and
hounds
with
long
white
bodies
came
out
of
the
air
suddenly
and
ran
at
them
and
harried
them
the
maines
children
dropped
their
spades
and
stood
with
quaking
joints
and
terror
strucken
faces
till
maeve
called
out
are
but
common
men
the
maines
children
have
not
dropped
their
spades
because
earth
crazy
for
its
broken
power
casts
up
a
show
and
the
winds
answer
it
with
holy
shadows
her
high
heart
was
glad
and
when
the
uproar
ran
along
the
grass
she
followed
with
light
footfall
in
the
midst
till
it
died
out
where
an
old
thorn
tree
stood
friend
of
these
many
years
you
too
had
stood
with
equal
courage
in
that
whirling
rout
for
you
although
you
not
her
wandering
heart
have
all
that
greatness
and
not
hers
alone
for
there
is
no
high
story
about
queens
in
any
ancient
book
but
tells
of
you
and
when
i
heard
how
they
grew
old
and
died
or
fell
into
unhappiness
i
said
will
grow
old
and
die
and
she
has
wept
and
when
i
write
it
out
anew
the
words
half
crazy
with
the
thought
she
too
has
wept
outrun
the
measure
i
tell
of
that
great
queen
who
stood
amid
a
silence
by
the
thorn
until
two
lovers
came
out
of
the
air
with
bodies
made
out
of
soft
fire
the
one
about
whose
face
birds
wagged
their
fiery
wings
said
and
his
sweetheart
give
their
thanks
to
maeve
and
to
maeve
household
owing
all
in
owing
them
the
that
gives
peace
then
maeve
aengus
master
of
all
lovers
a
thousand
years
ago
you
held
high
talk
with
the
first
kings
of
many
pillared
cruachan
o
when
will
you
grow
weary
they
had
vanished
but
out
of
the
dark
air
over
her
head
there
came
a
murmur
of
soft
words
and
meeting
lips
baile
and
aillinn
argument
baile
and
aillinn
were
lovers
but
aengus
the
master
of
love
wishing
them
to
be
happy
in
his
own
land
among
the
dead
told
to
each
a
story
of
the
other
death
so
that
their
hearts
were
broken
and
they
died
i
hardly
hear
the
curlew
cry
nor
the
grey
rush
when
wind
is
high
before
my
thoughts
begin
to
run
on
the
heir
of
ulad
buan
son
baile
who
had
the
honey
mouth
and
that
mild
woman
of
the
south
aillinn
who
was
king
lugaid
heir
their
love
was
never
drowned
in
care
of
this
or
that
thing
nor
grew
cold
because
their
bodies
had
grown
old
being
forbid
to
marry
on
earth
they
blossomed
to
immortal
mirth
about
the
time
when
christ
was
born
when
the
long
wars
for
the
white
horn
and
the
brown
bull
had
not
yet
come
young
baile
whom
some
called
rather
baile
rode
out
of
emain
with
a
band
of
harpers
and
young
men
and
they
imagined
as
they
struck
the
way
to
many
pastured
muirthemne
that
all
things
fell
out
happily
and
there
for
all
that
fools
had
said
baile
and
aillinn
would
be
wed
they
found
an
old
man
running
there
he
had
ragged
long
hair
he
had
knees
that
stuck
out
of
his
hose
he
had
puddle
water
in
his
shoes
he
had
half
a
cloak
to
keep
him
dry
although
he
had
a
squirrel
eye
o
wandering
birds
and
rushy
beds
you
put
such
folly
in
our
heads
with
all
this
crying
in
the
wind
no
common
love
is
to
our
mind
and
our
poor
kate
or
nan
is
less
than
any
whose
unhappiness
awoke
the
harp
strings
long
ago
yet
they
that
know
all
things
but
know
that
all
life
had
to
give
us
is
a
child
laughter
a
woman
kiss
who
was
it
put
so
great
a
scorn
in
the
grey
reeds
that
night
and
morn
are
trodden
and
broken
by
the
herds
and
in
the
light
bodies
of
birds
that
north
wind
tumbles
to
and
fro
and
pinches
among
hail
and
snow
that
runner
said
am
from
the
south
i
run
to
baile
to
tell
him
how
the
girl
aillinn
rode
from
the
country
of
her
kin
and
old
and
young
men
rode
with
her
for
all
that
country
had
been
astir
if
anybody
half
as
fair
had
chosen
a
husband
anywhere
but
where
it
could
see
her
every
day
when
they
had
ridden
a
little
way
an
old
man
caught
the
horse
head
with
you
must
home
again
and
wed
with
somebody
in
your
own
land
a
young
man
cried
and
kissed
her
hand
o
lady
wed
with
one
of
us
and
when
no
face
grew
piteous
for
any
gentle
thing
she
spake
she
fell
and
died
of
the
because
a
lover
heart
worn
out
being
tumbled
and
blown
about
by
its
own
blind
imagining
and
will
believe
that
anything
that
is
bad
enough
to
be
true
is
true
baile
heart
was
broken
in
two
and
he
being
laid
upon
green
boughs
was
carried
to
the
goodly
house
where
the
hound
of
ulad
sat
before
the
brazen
pillars
of
his
door
his
face
bowed
low
to
weep
the
end
of
the
harper
daughter
and
her
friend
for
although
years
had
passed
away
he
always
wept
them
on
that
day
for
on
that
day
they
had
been
betrayed
and
now
that
is
laid
under
a
cairn
of
sleepy
stone
before
his
eyes
he
has
tears
for
none
although
he
is
carrying
stone
but
two
for
whom
the
cairn
but
heaped
anew
we
hold
because
our
memory
is
so
full
of
that
thing
and
of
this
that
out
of
sight
is
out
of
mind
but
the
grey
rush
under
the
wind
and
the
grey
bird
with
crooked
bill
have
such
long
memories
that
they
still
remember
deirdre
and
her
man
and
when
we
walk
with
kate
or
nan
about
the
windy
water
side
our
heart
can
hear
the
voices
chide
how
could
we
be
so
soon
content
who
know
the
way
that
naoise
went
and
they
have
news
of
deirdre
eyes
who
being
lovely
was
so
wise
ah
wise
my
heart
knows
well
how
wise
now
had
that
old
gaunt
crafty
one
gathering
his
cloak
about
him
run
where
aillinn
rode
with
waiting
maids
who
amid
leafy
lights
and
shades
dreamed
of
the
hands
that
would
unlace
their
bodices
in
some
dim
place
when
they
had
come
to
the
marriage
bed
and
harpers
pondering
with
bowed
head
a
music
that
had
thought
enough
of
the
ebb
of
all
things
to
make
love
grow
gentle
without
sorrowings
and
men
with
slings
who
peered
about
on
every
side
and
amid
leafy
light
he
cried
is
well
out
of
wind
and
wave
they
have
heaped
the
stones
above
his
grave
in
muirthemne
and
over
it
in
changeless
ogham
letters
writ
baile
that
was
of
rury
seed
but
the
gods
long
ago
decreed
no
waiting
maid
should
ever
spread
baile
and
aillinn
marriage
bed
for
they
should
clip
and
clip
again
where
wild
bees
hive
on
the
great
plain
therefore
it
is
but
little
news
that
put
this
hurry
in
my
shoes
and
hurrying
to
the
south
he
came
to
that
high
hill
the
herdsmen
name
the
hill
seat
of
leighin
because
some
god
or
king
had
made
the
laws
that
held
the
land
together
there
in
old
times
among
the
clouds
of
the
air
that
old
man
climbed
the
day
grew
dim
two
swans
came
flying
up
to
him
linked
by
a
gold
chain
each
to
each
and
with
low
murmuring
laughing
speech
alighted
on
the
windy
grass
they
knew
him
his
changed
body
was
tall
proud
and
ruddy
and
light
wings
were
hovering
over
the
harp
strings
that
etain
midhir
wife
had
wove
in
the
hid
place
being
crazed
by
love
what
shall
i
call
them
fish
that
swim
scale
rubbing
scale
where
light
is
dim
by
a
broad
leaf
or
mice
in
the
one
wheaten
sheaf
forgotten
at
the
threshing
place
or
birds
lost
in
the
one
clear
space
of
morning
light
in
a
dim
sky
or
it
may
be
the
eyelids
of
one
eye
or
the
door
pillars
of
one
house
or
two
sweet
blossoming
apple
boughs
that
have
one
shadow
on
the
ground
or
the
two
strings
that
made
one
sound
where
that
wise
harper
finger
ran
for
this
young
girl
and
this
young
man
have
happiness
without
an
end
because
they
have
made
so
good
a
friend
they
know
all
wonders
for
they
pass
the
towery
gates
of
gorias
and
findrias
and
falias
and
murias
among
the
giant
kings
whose
hoard
cauldron
and
spear
and
stone
and
sword
was
robbed
before
earth
gave
the
wheat
wandering
from
broken
street
to
street
they
come
where
some
huge
watcher
is
and
tremble
with
their
love
and
kiss
they
know
undying
things
for
they
wander
where
earth
withers
away
though
nothing
troubles
the
great
streams
but
light
from
the
pale
stars
and
gleams
from
the
holy
orchards
where
there
is
none
but
fruit
that
is
of
precious
stone
or
apples
of
the
sun
and
moon
what
were
our
praise
to
them
they
eat
quiet
wild
heart
like
daily
meat
who
when
night
thickens
are
afloat
on
dappled
skins
in
a
glass
boat
far
out
under
a
windless
sky
while
over
them
birds
of
aengus
fly
and
over
the
tiller
and
the
prow
and
waving
white
wings
to
and
fro
awaken
wanderings
of
light
air
to
stir
their
coverlet
and
their
hair
and
poets
found
old
writers
say
a
yew
tree
where
his
body
lay
but
a
wild
apple
hid
the
grass
with
its
sweet
blossom
where
hers
was
and
being
in
good
heart
because
a
better
time
had
come
again
after
the
deaths
of
many
men
and
that
long
fighting
at
the
ford
they
wrote
on
tablets
of
thin
board
made
of
the
apple
and
the
yew
all
the
love
stories
that
they
knew
let
rush
and
bird
cry
out
their
fill
of
the
harper
daughter
if
they
will
beloved
i
am
not
afraid
of
her
she
is
not
wiser
nor
lovelier
and
you
are
more
high
of
heart
than
she
for
all
her
wanderings
but
i
have
bird
and
rush
forget
those
other
two
for
never
yet
has
lover
lived
but
longed
to
wive
like
them
that
are
no
more
alive
the
arrow
i
thought
of
your
beauty
and
this
arrow
made
out
of
a
wild
thought
is
in
my
marrow
there
no
man
may
look
upon
her
no
man
as
when
newly
grown
to
be
a
woman
blossom
pale
she
pulled
down
the
pale
blossom
at
the
moth
hour
and
hid
it
in
her
bosom
this
beauty
kinder
yet
for
a
reason
i
could
weep
that
the
old
is
out
of
season
the
folly
of
being
comforted
one
that
is
ever
kind
said
yesterday
well
beloved
hair
has
threads
of
grey
and
little
shadows
come
about
her
eyes
time
can
but
make
it
easier
to
be
wise
though
now
it
hard
till
trouble
is
at
an
end
and
so
be
patient
be
wise
and
patient
friend
but
heart
there
is
no
comfort
not
a
grain
time
can
but
make
her
beauty
over
again
because
of
that
great
nobleness
of
hers
the
fire
that
stirs
about
her
when
she
stirs
burns
but
more
clearly
o
she
had
not
these
ways
when
all
the
wild
summer
was
in
her
gaze
o
heart
o
heart
if
she
but
turn
her
head
you
know
the
folly
of
being
comforted
the
withering
of
the
boughs
i
cried
when
the
moon
was
murmuring
to
the
birds
peewit
call
and
curlew
cry
where
they
will
i
long
for
your
merry
and
tender
and
pitiful
words
for
the
roads
are
unending
and
there
is
no
place
to
my
mind
the
moon
lay
low
on
the
sleepy
hill
and
i
fell
asleep
upon
lonely
echtge
of
streams
no
boughs
have
withered
because
of
the
wintry
wind
the
boughs
have
withered
because
i
have
told
them
my
dreams
i
know
of
the
leafy
paths
that
the
witches
take
who
come
with
their
crowns
of
pearl
and
their
spindles
of
wool
and
their
secret
smile
out
of
the
depths
of
the
lake
and
of
apple
islands
where
the
danaan
kind
wind
and
unwind
their
dances
when
the
light
grows
cool
on
the
island
lawns
their
feet
where
the
pale
foam
gleams
no
boughs
have
withered
because
of
the
wintry
wind
the
boughs
have
withered
because
i
have
told
them
my
dreams
i
know
of
the
sleepy
country
where
swans
fly
round
coupled
with
golden
chains
and
sing
as
they
fly
a
king
and
a
queen
are
wandering
there
and
the
sound
has
made
them
so
happy
and
hopeless
so
deaf
and
so
blind
with
wisdom
they
wander
till
all
the
years
have
gone
by
i
know
and
the
curlew
and
peewit
on
echtge
of
streams
no
boughs
have
withered
because
of
the
wintry
wind
the
boughs
have
withered
because
i
have
told
them
my
dreams
adam
curse
we
sat
together
at
one
summer
end
that
beautiful
mild
woman
your
close
friend
and
you
and
i
and
talked
of
poetry
i
said
line
will
take
us
hours
maybe
yet
if
it
does
not
seem
a
moment
thought
our
stitching
and
unstitching
has
been
naught
better
go
down
upon
your
marrow
bones
and
scrub
a
kitchen
pavement
or
break
stones
like
an
old
pauper
in
all
kinds
of
weather
for
to
articulate
sweet
sounds
together
is
to
work
harder
than
all
these
and
yet
be
thought
an
idler
by
the
noisy
set
of
bankers
schoolmasters
and
clergymen
the
martyrs
call
the
world
that
woman
then
murmured
with
her
young
voice
for
whose
mild
sake
there
many
a
one
shall
find
out
all
heartache
in
finding
that
it
young
and
mild
and
low
is
one
thing
that
all
we
women
know
although
we
never
heard
of
it
at
school
that
we
must
labour
to
be
beautiful
i
said
certain
there
is
no
fine
thing
since
adam
fall
but
needs
much
labouring
there
have
been
lovers
who
thought
love
should
be
so
much
compounded
of
high
courtesy
that
they
would
sigh
and
quote
with
learned
looks
precedents
out
of
beautiful
old
books
yet
now
it
seems
an
idle
trade
enough
we
sat
grown
quiet
at
the
name
of
love
we
saw
the
last
embers
of
daylight
die
and
in
the
trembling
of
the
sky
a
moon
worn
as
if
it
had
been
a
shell
washed
by
time
waters
as
they
rose
and
fell
about
the
stars
and
broke
in
days
and
years
i
had
a
thought
for
no
one
but
your
ears
that
you
were
beautiful
and
that
i
strove
to
love
you
in
the
old
high
way
of
love
that
it
had
all
seemed
happy
and
yet
we
grown
as
weary
hearted
as
that
hollow
moon
the
song
of
red
hanrahan
the
old
brown
thorn
trees
break
in
two
high
over
cummen
strand
under
a
bitter
black
wind
that
blows
from
the
left
hand
our
courage
breaks
like
an
old
tree
in
a
black
wind
and
dies
but
we
have
hidden
in
our
hearts
the
flame
out
of
the
eyes
of
cathleen
the
daughter
of
houlihan
the
wind
has
bundled
up
the
clouds
high
over
knocknarea
and
thrown
the
thunder
on
the
stones
for
all
that
maeve
can
say
angers
that
are
like
noisy
clouds
have
set
our
hearts
abeat
but
we
have
all
bent
low
and
low
and
kissed
the
quiet
feet
of
cathleen
the
daughter
of
houlihan
the
yellow
pool
has
overflowed
high
up
on
for
the
wet
winds
are
blowing
out
of
the
clinging
air
like
heavy
flooded
waters
our
bodies
and
our
blood
but
purer
than
a
tall
candle
before
the
holy
rood
is
cathleen
the
daughter
of
houlihan
the
old
men
admiring
themselves
in
the
water
i
heard
the
old
old
men
say
alters
and
one
by
one
we
drop
away
they
had
hands
like
claws
and
their
knees
were
twisted
like
the
old
thorn
trees
by
the
waters
i
heard
the
old
old
men
say
that
beautiful
drifts
away
like
the
waters
under
the
moon
i
have
no
happiness
in
dreaming
of
brycelinde
nor
avalon
the
grass
green
hollow
nor
joyous
isle
where
one
found
lancelot
crazed
and
hid
him
for
a
while
nor
ulad
when
naoise
had
thrown
a
sail
upon
the
wind
nor
lands
that
seem
too
dim
to
be
burdens
on
the
heart
where
out
of
the
moon
light
and
the
seven
old
sisters
wind
the
threads
of
the
long
lived
ones
where
aengus
has
thrown
the
gates
apart
and
where
one
kills
an
ox
at
dawn
to
find
it
when
night
falls
laid
on
a
golden
bier
therein
are
many
queens
like
branwen
and
guinivere
and
niam
and
laban
and
fand
who
could
change
to
an
otter
or
fawn
and
the
whose
lover
was
changed
to
a
hawk
and
whether
i
go
in
my
dreams
by
woodland
or
dun
or
shore
or
on
the
unpeopled
waves
with
kings
to
pull
at
the
oar
i
hear
the
harp
string
praise
them
or
hear
their
mournful
talk
because
of
a
story
i
heard
under
the
thin
horn
of
the
third
moon
that
hung
between
the
night
and
the
day
to
dream
of
women
whose
beauty
was
folded
in
dismay
even
in
an
old
story
is
a
burden
not
to
be
borne
the
players
ask
for
a
blessing
on
the
psalteries
and
themselves
three
voices
together
hurry
to
bless
the
hands
that
play
the
mouths
that
speak
the
notes
and
strings
o
masters
of
the
glittering
town
o
lay
the
shrilly
trumpet
down
though
drunken
with
the
flags
that
sway
over
the
ramparts
and
the
towers
and
with
the
waving
of
your
wings
first
voice
maybe
they
linger
by
the
way
one
gathers
up
his
purple
gown
one
leans
and
mutters
by
the
wall
he
dreads
the
weight
of
mortal
hours
second
voice
o
no
o
no
they
hurry
down
like
plovers
that
have
heard
the
call
third
voice
o
kinsmen
of
the
three
in
one
o
kinsmen
bless
the
hands
that
play
the
notes
they
waken
shall
live
on
when
all
this
heavy
history
done
our
hands
our
hands
must
ebb
away
three
voices
together
the
proud
and
careless
notes
live
on
but
bless
our
hands
that
ebb

many

unhook
their
heavy
swords
from
golden
and
silver
boughs
but
all
that
are
killed
in
battle
awaken
to
life
again
it
is
lucky
that
their
story
is
not
known
among
men
for
o
the
strong
farmers
that
would
let
the

lie
for

will
unhook
his

from

blow
a

noise
when

gabriel
will
come
from

with
a

i
made
some
of
these
poems
walking
about
among
the
seven
woods
before
the
big
wind
of
nineteen
hundred
and
three
blew
down
so
many
trees
troubled
the
wild
creatures
changed
the
look
of
things
and
i
thought
out
there
a
good
part
of
the
play
which
follows
the
first
shape
of
it
came
to
me
in
a
dream
but
it
changed
much
in
the
making
foreshadowing
it
may
be
a
change
that
may
bring
a
less
will
into
my
verses
i
never
anything
so
many
times
for
at
first
i
could
not
make
these
wills
that
stream
into
mere
life
poetical
but
now
i
hope
to
do
easily
much
more
of
the
kind
and
that
our
new
irish
players
will
find
the
buskin
and
the
sock
on

to
tell
it
then
words
came
between
them
and
they
fought
the
young
man
killed
half
of
them
and
the
others
ran
away
fintain
it
matters
nothing
to
us
but
he
has
come
at
last
barach
who
has
come
fintain
i
know
who
that
young
man
is
there
is
not
another
like
him
in
the
world
i
saw
him
when
i
had
my
eyesight
barach
you
saw
him
fintain
i
used
to
be
in
aoife
country
when
i
had
my
eyesight
barach
that
was
before
you
went
on
shipboard
and
were
blinded
for
putting
a
curse
on
the
wind
fintain
queen
aoife
had
a
son
that
was
red
haired
and
pale
faced
like
herself
and
everyone
said
that
he
would
kill
cuchullain
some
day
but
i
would
not
have
that
spoken
of
barach
nobody
could
do
that
who
was
his
father
fintain
nobody
but
aoife
knew
that
not
even
he
himself
barach
not
even
he
himself
was
aoife
a
goddess
lecherous
fintain
i
overheard
her
telling
that
she
never
had
but
one
lover
and
that
he
was
the
only
man
who
overcame
her
in
battle
there
were
some
who
thought
him
one
of
the
riders
of
the
sidhe
because
the
child
was
great
of
limb
and
strong
beyond
others
the
child
was
begotten
over
the
mountains
but
come
nearer
and
i
will
tell
you
something
barach
you
have
thought
something
fintain
when
i
hear
the
young
girls
talking
about
the
colour
of
eyes
how
they
have
seven
colours
i
have
thought
about
it
that
young
man
has
aoife
face
and
hair
but
he
has
cuchullain
eyes
barach
how
can
he
have
cuchullain
eyes
fintain
he
is
cuchullain
son
barach
and
his
mother
has
sent
him
hither
to
fight
his
father
fintain
it
is
all
quite
plain
cuchullain
went
into
aoife
country
when
he
was
a
young
man
that
he
might
learn
skill
in
arms
and
there
he
became
aoife
lover
barach
and
now
she
hates
him
because
he
went
away
and
has
sent
the
son
to
kill
the
father
i
knew
she
was
a
goddess
fintain
and
she
never
told
him
who
his
father
was
that
he
might
do
it
i
have
thought
it
all
out
fool
i
know
a
great
many
things
because
i
listen
when
nobody
is
noticing
and
i
keep
my
wits
awake
what
ails
you
now
barach
i
have
remembered
that
i
am
hungry
fintain
well
forget
it
again
and
i
will
tell
you
about
aoife
country
it
is
full
of
wonders
there
are
a
great
many
queens
there
who
can
change
themselves
into
wolves
and
into
swine
and
into
white
hares
and
when
they
are
in
their
own
shapes
they
are
stronger
than
almost
any
man
and
there
are
young
men
there
who
have
cat
eyes
and
if
a
bird
chirrup
or
a
mouse
squeak
they
can
not
keep
them
shut
even
though
it
is
bedtime
and
they
sleepy
and
listen
for
this
is
a
great
wonder
a
very
great
wonder
there
is
a
long
narrow
bridge
and
when
anybody
goes
to
cross
it
that
the
queens
do
not
like
it
flies
up
as
this
bench
would
if
you
were
to
sit
on
the
end
of
it
everybody
who
goes
there
to
learn
skill
in
arms
has
to
cross
it
it
was
in
that
country
too
that
cuchullain
got
his
spear
made
out
of
dragon
bones
there
were
two
dragons
fighting
in
the
foam
of
the
sea
their
grandam
was
the
moon
and
six
queens
came
along
the
shore
barach
i
wo
listen
to
your
story
fintain
it
is
a
very
wonderful
story
wait
till
you
hear
what
the
six
queens
did
their
right
hands
were
all
made
of
silver
barach
no
i
will
have
my
dinner
first

have
eaten
the
fowl
i
left
in
front
of
the
fire
the
last
time
you
sent
me
to
steal
something
you
made
me
forget
all
about
it
till
you
had
eaten
it
up
fintain
no
there
is
plenty
for
us
both
barach
come
with
me
where
it
is
fintain
who
is
being
led
towards
the
door
at
the
back
by
barach
o
it
is
all
right
it
is
in
a
safe
place
barach
it
is
a
fine
fowl
it
was
the
biggest
in
the
yard
fintain
it
had
a
good
smell
but
i
hope
that
the
wild
dogs
have
not
smelt
it
voices
are
heard
outside
the
door
at
the
side
here
is
our
master
let
us
stay
and
talk
with
him
perhaps
cuchullain
will
give
you
a
new
cap
with
a
feather
he
told
me
that
he
would
give
you
a
new
cap
with
a
feather
a
feather
with
an
eye
that
looks
at
you
a
peacock
feather
barach
no
no
he
begins
pulling
fintain
towards
the
door
fintain
if
you
do
not
get
it
now
you
may
never
get
it
for
the
young
man
may
kill
him
barach
no
no
i
am
hungry
what
a
head
you
have
blind
man
who
but
you
would
have
remembered
that
the
slept
for
a
little
at
noon
every
day
fintain
who
is
being
led
along
very
slowly
and
unwillingly
yes
i
have
a
good
head
the
fowl
should
be
done
just
right
but
one
never
knows
when
a
wild
dog
may
come
out
of
the
woods
they
go
out
through
the
big
door
at
the
back
as
they
go
out
cuchullain
certain
young
kings
come
in
at
the
side
door
cuchullain
though
still
young
is
a
good
deal
older
than
the
others
they
are
all
very
gaily
dressed
and
have
their
hair
fastened
with
balls
of
gold
the
young
men
crowd
about
cuchullain
with
wondering
attention
first
young
king
you
have
hurled
that
stone
beyond
our
utmost
mark
time
after
time
but
yet
you
are
not
weary
second
young
king
he
has
slept
on
the
bare
ground
of
fuad
hill
this
week
past
waiting
for
the
bulls
and
the
deer
cuchullain
well
why
should
i
be
weary
first
young
king
it
is
certain
his
father
was
the
god
who
wheels
the
sun
and
not
king
sualtam
third
young
king
to
a
young
king
who
is
beside
him
he
came
in
the
dawn
and
folded
dectara
in
a
sudden
fire
fourth
young
king
and
yet
the
mother
half
might
well
grow
weary
and
it
new
come
from
labours
over
sea
third
young
king
he
has
been
on
islands
walled
about
with
silver
and
fought
with
giants
they
gather
about
the
ale
vat
and
begin
to
drink
cuchullain
who
was
it
that
went
out
third
young
king
as
we
came
in
cuchullain
yes
third
young
king
barach
and
blind
fintain
cuchullain
they
always
flock
together
the
blind
man
has
need
of
the
fool
eyesight
and
strong
body
while
the
poor
fool
has
need
of
the
other
wit
and
night
and
day
is
up
to
his
ears
in
mischief
that
the
blind
man
imagines
there
no
but
clucks
and
cackles
when
he
passes
by
as
if
he
been
a
fox
if
i
that
ball
that
in
your
hair
and
the
big
stone
again
i
keep
them
tossing
though
the
one
is
heavy
and
the
other
light
in
the
hand
a
trick
i
learnt
when
i
was
learning
arms
in
aoife
country
first
young
king
what
kind
of
woman
was
that
aoife
cuchullain
comely
first
young
king
but
i
have
heard
that
she
was
never
married
and
yet
that
natural
for
i
have
never
known
a
fighting
woman
but
made
her
favours
cheap
or
mocked
at
love
till
she
grew
sandy
dry
cuchullain
what
manner
of
woman
do
you
like
the
best
a
gentle
or
a
fierce
first
young
king
a
gentle
surely
cuchullain
i
think
that
a
fierce
woman
better
a
woman
that
breaks
away
when
you
have
thought
her
won
for
i
be
fed
and
hungry
at
one
time
i
think
that
all
deep
passion
is
but
a
kiss
in
the
mid
battle
and
a
difficult
peace
oil
and
water
candles
and
dark
night
and
hollow
the
sun
and
the
cold
sliding
moon
a
brief
forgiveness
between
opposites
that
have
been
hatreds
for
three
times
the
age
of
his
long
ground
here
concobar
so
i
be
done
but
keep
beside
me
still
for
while
he
talks
of
hammered
bronze
and
asks
what
wood
is
best
for
building
we
can
talk
of
a
fierce
woman
concobar
a
man
much
older
than
cuchullain
has
come
in
through
the
great
door
at
the
back
he
has
many
kings
about
him
one
of
these
kings
daire
a
stout
old
man
is
somewhat
drunk
concobar
to
one
of
those
about
him
has
the
ship
gone
yet
we
have
need
of
more
bronze
workers
and
that
ship
i
sent
to
africa
for
gold
is
late
cuchullain
i
knew
their
talk
concobar
seeing
cuchullain
you
are
before
us
king
cuchullain
so
much
the
better
for
i
welcome
you
into
my
muirthemne
concobar
but
who
are
these
the
odour
from
their
garments
when
they
stir
is
like
a
wind
out
of
an
apple
garden
cuchullain
my
swordsmen
and
harp
players
and
fine
dancers
my
bosom
friends
concobar
i
should
have
thought
cuchullain
my
graver
company
would
better
match
your
greatness
and
your
years
but
i
waste
breath
in
harping
on
that
tale
cuchullain
you
do
great
king
because
their
youth
is
the
kind
wandering
wave
that
carries
me
about
the
world
and
if
it
sank
my
sword
would
lose
its
lightness
concobar
yet
cuchullain
emain
should
be
the
foremost
town
of
the
world
cuchullain
it
is
the
foremost
town
concobar
no
no
it
not
nothing
but
men
can
make
towns
great
and
he
the
one
man
that
in
the
world
keeps
far
away
daire
he
will
not
hear
you
king
and
we
old
men
had
best
keep
company
with
one
another
i
fill
the
horn
for
you
concobar
i
will
not
drink
old
fool
you
have
drunk
a
horn
at
every
door
we
came
to
daire
you
better
drink
for
old
men
light
upon
their
youth
again
in
the
brown
ale
when
i
have
drunk
enough
i
am
like
cuchullain
as
one
pea
another
and
live
like
a
bird
flight
from
tree
to
tree
concobar
we
to
our
chairs
for
we
have
much
to
talk
of
and
we
have
ullad
and
muirthemne
and
here
is
conall
muirthemne
in
the
nick
of
time
he
goes
to
the
back
of
stage
to
welcome
a
company
of
kings
who
come
in
through
the
great
door
the
other
kings
gradually
get
into
their
places
cuchullain
sits
in
his
great
chair
with
certain
of
the
young
men
standing
around
him
others
of
the
young
men
however
remain
with
daire
at
the
ale
vat
daire
holds
out
the
horn
of
ale
to
one
or
two
of
the
older
kings
as
they
pass
him
going
to
their
places
they
pass
him
by
most
of
them
silently
refusing
daire
will
you
not
drink
an
old
king
not
till
the
council
over
a
young
king
but
i
drink
daire
another
young
king
fill
me
a
horn
too
daire
another
young
king
if
i
drunk
half
that
you
have
drunk
i
be
upon
all
fours
daire
that
would
be
natural
when
mother
earth
had
given
you
this
good
milk
from
her
great
breasts
cuchullain
to
one
of
the
young
kings
beside
him
one
is
content
awhile
with
a
soft
warm
woman
who
folds
up
our
lives
in
silky
network
then
one
knows
not
why
but
one
away
after
a
flinty
heart
the
young
king
how
long
can
the
net
keep
us
cuchullain
all
our
lives
if
there
are
children
and
a
dozen
moons
if
there
are
none
because
a
growing
child
has
so
much
need
of
watching
it
can
make
a
passion
that
as
changeable
as
the
sea
change
till
it
holds
the
wide
earth
to
its
heart
at
least
i
have
heard
a
father
say
it
but
i
being
childless
do
not
know
it
come
nearer
yet
though
he
is
ringing
that
old
silver
rod
we
have
our
own
talk
out
they
can
not
hear
us
concobar
who
is
now
seated
in
his
great
chair
opposite
cuchullain
beats
upon
the
pillar
of
the
house
that
is
nearest
to
him
with
a
rod
of
silver
till
the
kings
have
become
silent
cuchullain
alone
continues
to
talk
in
a
low
voice
to
those
about
him
but
not
so
loud
as
to
disturb
the
silence
concobar
rises
and
speaks
standing
concobar
i
have
called
you
hither
kings
of
ullad
and
kings
of
muirthemne
and
connall
muirthemne
and
tributary
kings
for
now
there
is
peace
it
time
to
build
up
emain
that
was
burned
at
the
outsetting
of
these
wars
for
we
being
the
foremost
men
should
have
high
chairs
and
be
much
stared
at
and
wondered
at
and
speak
out
of
more
laughing
overflowing
hearts
than
common
men
it
is
the
art
of
kings
to
make
what
noble
nobler
in
men
eyes
by
wide
uplifted
roofs
where
beaten
gold
that
ruddy
with
desire
marries
pale
silver
among
the
shadowing
beams
and
many
a
time
i
would
have
called
you
hither
to
this
work
but
always
when
i
all
but
summoned
you
some
war
or
some
rebellion
would
break
out
daire
where
maine
morgor
and
old
usnach
children
and
that
queen
and
many
near
as
great
that
got
their
death
because
you
hated
peace
i
can
remember
the
people
crying
out
when
deirdre
passed
and
maine
morgor
had
a
cold
grey
eye
well
well
i
throw
this
on
the
ground
for
it
may
be
they
are
thirsty
a
king
be
silent
fool
another
king
be
silent
daire
concobar
let
him
speak
his
mind
i
have
no
need
to
be
afraid
of
ghosts
for
i
have
made
but
necessary
wars
i
warred
to
strengthen
emain
or
because
when
wars
are
out
they
marry
and
beget
and
have
their
generations
like
mankind
and
there
no
help
for
it
but
i
well
content
that
they
have
ended
and
left
the
town
so
great
that
its
mere
name
shall
be
in
times
to
come
like
a
great
ale
vat
where
the
men
of
the
world
shall
drink
no
common
ale
but
the
hard
will
the
unquenchable
hope
the
friendliness
of
the
sword
he
takes
thin
boards
on
which
plans
have
been
carved
by
those
about
him
give
me
the
building
plans
and
have
you
written
that
we
cuchullain
is
looking
in
his
shield
it
may
be
the
pale
riders
of
the
wind
throw
pictures
on
it
or
that
mananan
his
father
friend
and
sometime
fosterer
foreknower
of
all
things
has
cast
a
vision
out
of
the
cold
dark
of
the
rich
sea
foretelling
emain
greatness
cuchullain
no
great
king
i
looked
on
this
out
of
mere
idleness
imagining
a
woman
that
i
loved
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
without
concobar
open
the
door
for
that
is
a
herald
trumpet
the
great
door
at

man

his
sword
i
will
give

other
proof
than
the
hawk

is
silent
a
moment
then
speaks
to
all
yet
look
upon
me

i
too
am
of
that
ancient
seed
and
carry
the
signs
about
this

have
shown
the
hawk
grey
feather
is
enough
and

too
cuchullain
comes
down
from
his
great
chair
he
remains
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
chair
the
young
kings
gather
about
him
and
begin
to
arm
him
give
me
that
helmet

grown
weary
sending

those
great
kings
came
into
the
that
had
been
baited
with
maeve
pretty
daughter

the
tale
is
worthy
of
a
winter
night

be
tighter

me
your
shield
there
is
good
level
ground
at
baile
some
dozen
yards
from

it
but
truth
that
i
am
sad
and
this
fight
welcome
he
looks
hard
at
the
young
man
and
then
steps
down
on
to
the
floor
of
the
assembly
house
he
grasps
the
young
man
by
the
shoulder
hither
into
the
light
turning
to
one
of
the
young
kings
that
the
very
tint
of
her
that
i
was
speaking
of
but
now
not
a
pin
difference
to
the
young
man

from
the
north

are
many
that

that
tint
of
hair

i
am
their
plough
their
harrow
their
very
strength
for
he
that
in
the
sun
begot
this
body
upon
a
mortal
woman
and
i
have
heard
tell
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
outrun
the
moon
that
he
must
always
follow
through
waste
heaven
he
loved
so
happily
he
be
but
slow
to
break
a
tree
that
was
so
sweetly
planted
let
see
that
arm
i
see
it
if
i
like
that
arm
had
a
good
father
and
a
good
mother
but
it
is
not
like
this
young
man
you
are
mocking
me
you
think
i
am
not
worthy
to
be
fought
but
i
not
wrangle
but
with
this
talkative
knife
cuchullain
put
up
your
sword
i
am
not
mocking
you
i
have
you
for
my
friend
but
if
it
not
because
you
have
a
hot
heart
and
a
cold
eye
i
can
not
tell
the
reason
you
got
her
fierceness
and
nobody
is
as
fierce
as
those
pale
women
to
the
young
kings
we
keep
him
here
in
muirthemne
awhile
a
young

cry
what
you
will
cuchullain
you
stop
with
us
and
we
will
hunt
the
deer
and
the
wild
bulls
and
when
we
have
grown
weary
light
our
fires
in
sandy
places
where
the
foam
is
murmuring
and
breaking
and
it
may
be
that
women
will
come
out
of
the
dunes
to
dance
in
the
yellow
you
hang
your
head
young
man
as
if
it
was
not
a
good
life
and
yet
what
better
than
to
hurl
the
spear
and
hear
the
harp
and
dance
friendship
grows
quicker
in
the
murmuring
dark
but

can
see

no
more
need
for
words
and
that
you
be
my
friend
