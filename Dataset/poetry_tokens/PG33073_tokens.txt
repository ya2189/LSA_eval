memorandum
the
history
of
these
rhymes
is
briefly
an
arm
chair
made
many
years
ago
by
john
letchworth
for
leonard
and
jane
snowdon
was
presented
to
the
author
with
some
information
of
the
worthies
who
were
wont
to
visit
the
estimable
owners
accompanied
with
an
intimation
that
it
would
be
a
suitable
theme
for
some
verses
the
result
follows
the
arm
chair
the
poet
of
the
christian
muse
sung
of
the
sofa
could
i
but
infuse
some
of
his
talent
in
my
laggard
quill
some
of
his
genius
on
my
verse
distil
then
would
i
sing
my
theme
too
from
the
fair
of
thy
coevals
chair
he
who
with
artist
skill
scooped
out
thy
seat
trim
made
thy
elbows
uprights
and
thy
feet
now
fourscore
years
and
four
has
measured
and
waits
his
summons
to
the
heavenly
shore
honest
as
sunshine
he
who
runs
may
read
that
is
an
israelite
indeed
no
guile
within
him
ever
finds
a
place
love
of
the
father
spreads
to
all
the
race
his
gospel
ministry
is
void
of
show
for
few
and
savory
are
the
words
that
flow
condensed
and
pithy
are
his
periods
found
rich
in
their
matter
nothing
for
mere
sound
so
preaches
he
ah
what
a
sad
mistake
when
empty
sounds
upon
the
people
break
when
a
stentorian
voice
in
efforts
vain
roars
to
the
people
thunder
without
rain
its
booming
echoes
may
the
soul
appal
but
no
reviving
showers
on
nature
fall
would
that
my
age
if
age
to
me
be
given
might
prove
like
his
who
calmly
looks
to
heaven
waiting
with
patience
for
the
mandate
blessed
thy
labour
finished
enter
into
rest
here
said
the
patriarch
no
more
doomed
to

i
lie
waiting
my
final
change

when
thou
wilt
thy
faithful
life
will
prove
a
rich
example

of
love

my

the

how
many
a
worthy
hast
thou

me
to
portray
some
of
the
faithful
who

spoke
of
what
she
saw
in
visions
deep
when
filled
with
holy
awe
the
curtain
of
the
future
half
withdrew
while
coming
objects
glided
into
view
or
as
the
past
on

her
gospel
joys
her
gospel
woes
told
how
king
george
as
gushed

at
her

from
the
king
of
kings
of
deep
probations
for
her
lord
she
past
of
her
fond
hope
of
joining
him
at
last
told
how
her
soul
in
sympathy
had
long
borne
a
deep
burthen
for
the

of

she
shot
no
fiery

from
afar
kindling
those
feelings
that
engender
war
but

in
secret

thy

while
trembling
forth
she
sent
the
gospel
sound
a
very
quaker
as
she
gave
the
law
her
outward
motion
spoke
her
inward
awe
here
when
evening
came
at
length
from
the
day
toil
reposed
his
weary
strength
from
christian
sympathy
that
solace
drew
which
those
can
grant
who
heavenly
joys
pursue
mournful
of
spirit
he
was
ever
found
in
sympathy
with
souls
by
sorrow
bound
as
fell
his
plaintive
voice
upon
the
ear
the
poor
in
spirit
felt
a
friend
was
near
prompt
in
his
duty
at
the
house
of
prayer
to
plead
with
fervour
for
his
master
there
while
crowds
hung
trembling
on
that
zealous
tongue
which
only
woke
as
living
waters
sprung
he
never
preached
himself
his
every
word
directed
to
a
slain
and
risen
lord
he
to
the
weary
consolation
brought
he
for
the
burthened
sweet
deliverance
wrought
though
bound
himself
the
fettered
oft
set
free
the
jeremiah
of
his
age
was
he
has
here
oft
passed
a
friendly
hour
feeling
of
sympathy
the
magic
power
as
heart
to
heart
the
secret
influence
sent
as
prayer
ascended
where
no
knee
was
bent
as
for
each
other
welfare
sighs
were
given
unclothed
with
words
their
wishes
entering
heaven
the
indians
friend
he
sought
their
native
wood
an
anxious
labourer
for
the
redman
good
beside
the
lake
beneath
the
spreading
tree
his
gospel
message
flowed
as
truth
set
free
here
too
has
sat
like
him
of
stature
small
great
too
of
heart
a
minister
like
paul
one
who
obedient
to
his
master
will
was
studious
found
his
duty
to
fulfil
six
times
went
the
atlantic
wave
on
gospel
errands
sinful
man
to
save
and
still
returning
from
his
work
of
love
came
with
his
and
peaceful
dove
though
years
rolled
on
and
outward
sight
grew
dim
the
lamp
of
truth
still
brightly
burned
with
him
showing
distinctly
in
its
searching
light
deeds
that
the
actors
deemed
were
hid
in
night
his
urim
and
his
thummim
was
with
god
and
he
obedient
to
his
master
nod
as
secret
feeling
told
him
of
distress
the
sufferer
soon
his
foot
would
press
thus
mercy
led
and
pleasantly
he
said
that
he
by
jobbing
earned
his
daily
bread
ah
these
were
luscious
morsels
ate
with
joy
a
heavenly
relish
free
from
all
alloy
some
of
that
bread
of
which
the
righteous
eat
that
others
know
not
of
sustaining
meat
here
too
sweet
converse
sought
with
friends
in
unison
of
faith
and
thought
with
both
of
whom
in
gospel
yoke
she
knew
to
labour
as
her
lord
and
master
drew
honest
of
purpose
ardent
in
reproof
to
those
who
stood
from
duty
path
aloof
in
public
gatherings
or
in
private
hall
to
warn
the
giddy
of
impending
fall
rebuke
the
forward
lead
the
fearful
where
a
mighty
rock
did
israel
lord
prepare
instant
in
duty
though
severe
yet
kind
she
showed
the
vigour
of
a
mind
of
ardent
temper
quick
and
flashing
zeal
keen
as
high
polished
but
too
brittle
steel
in
earlier
life
had
been
found
like
a
high
steed
when
first
in
harness
bound
but
grace
had
tempered
and
obedience
wrought
a
change
of
character
in
word
and
thought
his
ardent
feelings
felt
love
holy
calm
fitting
a
follower
of
the
lowly
lamb
a
pointing
finger
to
none
other
shown
a
secret
whisper
to
none
other
known
bade
hasten
on
his
way
where
a
secluded
country
lay
a
few
sad
mourners
stood
beside
a
grave
where
dust
to
dust
a
solemn
language
gave
soon
from
his
lips
burst
forth
the
ardent
strain
i
know
not
who
this
coffin
may
contain
but
my
good
master
in
whose
power
i
came
now
bids
me
clear
from
wrong
an
injured
name
she
who
now
rests
within
this
narrow
bed
by
slander
wounded
bowed
her
sorrowing
head
accused
of
that
in
which
she
had
no
part
she
died
in
innocence
a
broken
heart
as
from
a
stranger
came
these
words
a
thrill
of
secret
wondering
joy
the
mourners
fill
for
she
who
died
told
as
approached
her
end
that
god
a
witness
to
her
grave
would
send
who
to
her
innocence
should
boldly
bear
a
clear
convincing
testimony
there
and
he
whose
ways
are
wrapt
in
mystery
still
blindfold
his
servant
led
to
do
his
will
oft
to
the
grave
this
servant
of
the
lord
was
sent
to
preach
the
everlasting
word
to
rouse
the
thoughtless
from
delusion
dream
memento
mori
was
his
frequent
theme
when
pestilence
her
raven
wing
outspread
when
terror
swept
the
living
from
the
dead
when
love
own
ties
were
severed
in
affright
and
duty
call
had
lost
its
wonted
might
and
others
a
devoted
band
before
the
march
of
terror
took
their
stand
they
nobly
dared
in
that
dark
hour
to
make
themselves
an
offering
for
the
people
sake
he
was
accepted

the
church
loss

store
of
all
that

could
give
of
classic
lore
sarcastic

opposing
views

purpose

his
subtle
will
a
learned
lawyer
could
sway

in
his
youthful
day
but
soon
like
paul
when
the
unseen
one
spoke
humble
he
bowed
and
bore
the
christian
yoke
gamaliel
lessons
ceasing
to
repeat
he
lay
a
learner
at
the
saviour
feet
simple
of
heart
and
of
a
feeble
frame

unworthy
even

to

by
him
of

to

no

who
the
ark
once
bore

these
were
gone
their
bodies
to

their

taken
to
their

a
cloud
around
our
israel
camp
arose
while
from
our
firesides
started
up
our
foes
when
a
bold
infidel
his
poison
spread
and
with
his
scorpions
hungry
children
fed
another
race
part
of
the
age
yet
of
the
present
then
employed
the
stage
when
boding
mists
had
gathering
force
and
form
was
taken
from
the
storm
true
to
her
master
she
was
free
to
die
yet
nature
shrank
from
the
last
agony
gladly
would
she
have
left
this
scene
of
pain
the
promised
kingdom
of
her
lord
to
gain
but
awful
feelings
shadowed
forth
the
strife
the
dread
concomitant
of
parting
life
gently
her
spirit
from
its
house
of
clay
was
sent
on
wings
of
mercy
on
its
way
when
came
the
messenger
to
free
her
eyes
were
holden
that
she
did
not
see
no
pain
no
sorrow
her
evening
prayer
joined
with
her
morning
hymn
of
glory
there
she
felt
no
agony
of
parting
breath
taken
in
kindness
without
tasting
death
melodious
singer
of
songs
of
zion
injuries
and
israel
wrongs
whose
lonely
harp
still
on
the
willow
hung
till
mercies
every
chord
restrung
then
touched
to
praise
its
tones
in
sweetness
broke
that
in
each
heart
responsive
feelings
woke
oh
i
behold
thee
as
i
last
beheld
when
gospel
love
thy
grateful
bosom
swelled
when
weeping
listeners
heard
the
tale
of
woe
of
mental
conflicts
it
was
thine
to
know
when
as
a
flood
the
enemy
came
in
sweeping
away
the
barriers
against
sin
when
from
a
pit
of
horror
burst
thy
moan
illumined
by
no
brightness
from
the
throne
when
sombre
shadows
compassed
thee
around
when
satan
legions
pierced
with
many
a
wound
when
the
rank
weeds
were
wrapp
about
thy
head
when
boisterous
billows
over
thee
were
spread
then
he
who
died
and
triumphed
the
grave
arose
in
might
thy
struggling
soul
to
save
bade
the
waves
sunder
and
temptations
fly
the
scattering
clouds
haste
from
the
brightening
sky
the
sun
of
righteousness
with
cheering
ray
shed
the
full
radiance
of
perfected
day
then
from
thy
lips
poured
forth
a
joyful
song
to
thy
redeemer
yea
it
poured
along
in
most
melodious
energy
of
praise
to
god
the
saviour
he
of
ancient
days
the
heart
and
language
rising
with
the
theme
till
praise
gushed
forth
one
living
glowing
stream
then
from
thy
lips
the
thrilling
language
fell
glory
to
him
who
raised
my
soul
from
hell
baptized
in
tears
was
many
a
cheek
that
day
as
told
her
checquered
way
was
her
last
gospel
labour
here
of
love
mercy
soon
gathered
her
to
praise
above
of
polished
manners
and
of
graceful
mien
lovely
in
life
was
seen
each
native
talent
sanctified
by
grace
was
kept
obedient
in
its
proper
place
not
quick
to
offer
cautious
still
to
try
as
gideon
did
his
fleece
both
wet
and
dry
like
leaven
working
where
no
eye
could
view
her
spirit
wrestled
for
the
heavenly
dew
she
dug
for
water
in
a
weary
soil
till
bubbling
recompensed
her
toil
as
gently
passed
the
fleeting
breath
away
retortive
memory
brought
her
youthful
day
and
one
fond
look
back
on
the
past
she
flung
while
oh
my
mother
trembled
on
her
tongue
then
the
freed
spirit
passed
and
beauteous
lay
the
rifled
casket
lovely
in
decay
widows
and
orphans
ye
may
mourn
indeed
who
now
shall
clothe
you
who
the
hungry
feed
yes
show
your
garments
tattered
ones
and
say
these
gave
us
in
a
wintry
day
from
the
bleak
storm
she
clothed
the
shivering
frame
when
sickness
pressed
with
healing
cordials
came
when
age
went
tottering
with
no
hand
to
save
she
gave
the
crutch
supporting
to
the
grave
no
cold
philosophy
was
her
to
dream
of
benthem
theory
or
malthus
scheme
as
the
heart
prompted
the
concurring
hand
obeyed
instinctively
each
kind
command
when
streams
of
suffering
ran
beside
her
door
the
bitter
waters
lost
their
nauseous
power
the
prophet
salt
she
in
the
current
threw
and
soft
and
sweet
the
changing
waters
grew
careful
her
master
bounty
to
bestow
a
faithful
stewardship
of
gifts
to
show
that
she
might
hear
that
language
at
the
close
to
me
ye
did
it
as
ye
did
to
those
a
pillar
of
the
church
erect
and
strong
swayed
by
no
friendship
to
the
church
wrong
unwarped
unmoved
sound
to
the
very
core
and
rendered
firmer
by
the
weight
he
bore
an
honest
watchman
the
alarm
to
sound
when
foes
were
sowing
tares
within
our
ground
or
rootless
plants
luxuriously
would
shoot
in
spreading
branches
and
produce
no
fruit
was
oft
the
archers
bows
were
bent
to
turn
the
veteran
from
his
firm
intent
their
malice
moved
not
and
their
threats
were
vain
fixed
at
his
post
determined
to
remain
and
when
at
last
the
final
goal
was
won
death
message
found
him
with
his
armour
on
no
oilless
lamp
to
trim
no
loins
to
gird
ready
to
enter
at
the
bridegroom
word
where
his
loved
earlier
called
away
was
his
forerunner
to
the
realms
of
day
so
too
our
when
she
heard
the
cry
her
wings
expanding
sought
her
home
on
high
one
thought
upon
a
faithful
sufferer
cast
told
her
own
hopes
then
to
her
audit
past
amid
the
terrors
of
that
evil
hour
when
infidelity
put
forth
its
power
though
meek
of
manners
and
of
gentle
heart
played
a
christian
soldier
part
though
courteous
firm
unwavering
though
kind
pupil
of
christ
he
disciplined
her
mind
secluded
long
from
active
service
here
yet
bearing
burdens
in
her
proper
sphere
in
humble
waiting
she
was
faithful
found
until
her
fetters
were
in
love
unbound
her
youthful
bud
of
promise
rare
was
early
called
to
bloom
in
regions
fair
another
cord
strong
though
unseen
to
move
the
heart
to
seek
a
resting
place
above
when
all
around
was
clothed
in
night
passed
from
earth
darkness
to
eternal
light

flown
to

round
the

death
drew

the
vale

devoid
of
fear
he
whom
he
loved

hour

no
terrors

grave
no
power

mother
rose
a

path
for
thee
thy
saviour
had
no
looks
of
wrath
oh

had
owned
him
long

oh
no
the

that
made
them
what
they
were
a

remnant

to
see
a
brighter
day
when
all
these

shall
pass
away

the
convulsion
which
has

begun
shall
pause
in
silence
all
its
purpose
done
when
the
oppressors
of
the
seed
shall
wear
the
mask
no

all
their
acts
laid
bare
when
chaff
and
cheat
shall
to
the
wind
be
doomed
and
dross
and
stubble
be
by
fire
consumed
when
to
the
world
the
worldly
part
is
given
when
the
redeemed
shall
closer
walk
with
heaven
when
to
our
zion
shall
the
weary
come
like
doves
to
windows
pressing
to
their
home
oh
haste
the
day
when
through
his
power
divine
the
father
light
around
his
church
shall
shine
many
there
are
whose
prayers
arise
for
this
whose
greatest
joy
would
be
in
zion
bliss
whose
morning
breathing
and
whose
evening
prayer
is
that
the
lord
would
place
his
glory
there
what
though
a
worldly
spirit
has
crept
in
that
fain
the
kingdom
through
new
ways
would
win
scorning
the
narrow
path
our
fathers
trod
and
circling
round
would
pass
the
cross
and
rod
yet
they
who
look
from
pisgah
height
can
see
such
lead
away
from

while
they
who
seek
in
empty
forms
for
bliss
will
grasp
at
shadows
and
the
substance
miss
no
no
as
ancient
clearly

still
with
this
people
shall
abide
the
law
still

the
testimony
here
be

to
the
altar
bound
the
lord
himself
his
attributes
shall
take
again
shall
order
out
of
chaos
break
then
shall
the
church
in
rapturous
numbers
sing
and
shout
victorious
as
she
owns
her
king

draw
