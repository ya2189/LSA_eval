second

spring
to
what
purpose
april
do
you
return
again
beauty
is
not
enough
you
can
no
longer
quiet
me
with
the
redness
of
little
leaves
opening
stickily
i
know
what
i
know
the
sun
is
hot
on
my
neck
as
i
observe
the
spikes
of
the
crocus
the
smell
of
the
earth
is
good
it
is
apparent
that
there
is
no
death
but
what
does
that
signify
not
only
under
ground
are
the
brains
of
men
eaten
by
maggots
life
in
itself
is
nothing
an
empty
cup
a
flight
of
uncarpeted
stairs
it
is
not
enough
that
yearly
down
this
hill
april
comes
like
an
idiot
babbling
and
strewing
flowers
city
trees
the
trees
along
this
city
street
save
for
the
traffic
and
the
trains
would
make
a
sound
as
thin
and
sweet
as
trees
in
country
lanes
and
people
standing
in
their
shade
out
of
a
shower
undoubtedly
would
hear
such
music
as
is
made
upon
a
country
tree
oh
little
leaves
that
are
so
dumb
against
the
shrieking
city
air
i
watch
you
when
the
wind
has
come
i
know
what
sound
is
there
the
in
the
bog
god
had
called
us
and
we
came
our
loved
earth
to
ashes
left
heaven
was
a
neighbor
house
open
to
us
bereft
gay
the
lights
of
heaven
showed
and
was
god
who
walked
ahead
yet
i
wept
along
the
road
wanting
my
own
house
instead
wept
unseen
unheeded
cried
all
you
things
my
eyes
have
kissed
fare
you
well
we
meet
no
more
lovely
lovely
tattered
mist
weary
wings
that
rise
and
fall
all
day
long
above
the
fire
red
with
heat
was
every
wall
rough
with
heat
was
every
wire
fare
you
well
you
little
winds
that
the
flying
embers
chase
fare
you
well
you
shuddering
day
with
your
hands
before
your
face
and
ah
blackened
by
strange
blight
or
to
a
false
sun
unfurled
now
forevermore
goodbye
all
the
gardens
in
the
world
on
the
windless
hills
of
heaven
that
i
have
no
wish
to
see
white
eternal
lilies
stand
by
a
lake
of
ebony
but
the
earth
forevermore
is
a
place
where
nothing
grows
dawn
will
come
and
no
bud
break
evening
and
no
blossom
close
spring
will
come
and
wander
slow
over
an
indifferent
land
stand
beside
an
empty
creek
hold
a
dead
seed
in
her
hand
god
had
called
us
and
we
came
but
the
blessed
road
i
trod
was
a
bitter
road
to
me
and
at
heart
i
questioned
god
though
in
heaven
i
said
be
all
that
the
heart
would
most
desire
held
earth
naught
save
souls
of
sinners
worth
the
saving
from
a
fire
withered
grass
the
wasted
growing
aimless
ache
of
laden
boughs
little
things
god
had
forgotten
called
me
from
my
burning
house
though
in
heaven
i
said
be
all
that
the
eye
could
ask
to
see
all
the
things
i
ever
knew
are
this
blaze
in
back
of
me
though
in
heaven
i
said
be
all
that
the
ear
could
think
to
lack
all
the
things
i
ever
knew
are
this
roaring
at
my
back
it
was
god
who
walked
ahead
like
a
shepherd
to
the
fold
in
his
footsteps
fared
the
weak
and
the
weary
and
the
old
glad
enough
of
gladness
over
ready
for
the
peace
to
be
but
a
thing
god
had
forgotten
was
the
growing
bones
of
me
and
i
drew
a
bit
apart
and
i
lagged
a
bit
behind
and
i
thought
on
peace
eternal
lest
he
look
into
my
mind
and
i
gazed
upon
the
sky
and
i
thought
of
heavenly
rest
and
i
slipped
away
like
water
through
the
fingers
of
the
blest
all
their
eyes
were
fixed
on
glory
not
a
glance
brushed
over
me
alleluia
alleluia
up
the
road
and
i
was
free
and
my
heart
rose
like
a
freshet
and
it
swept
me
on
before
giddy
as
a
whirling
stick
till
i
felt
the
earth
once
more
all
the
earth
was
charred
and
black
fire
had
swept
from
pole
to
pole
and
the
bottom
of
the
sea
was
as
brittle
as
a
bowl
and
the
timbered
was
as
naked
as
a
skull
nothing
left
nothing
left
of
the
earth
so
beautiful
earth
i
said
how
can
i
leave
you
you
are
all
i
have
i
said
what
is
left
to
take
my
mind
up
living
always
and
you
dead
speak
i
said
oh
tell
me
something
make
a
sign
that
i
can
see
for
a
keepsake
to
keep
always
quick
before
god
misses
me
and
i
listened
for
a
voice
but
my
heart
was
all
i
heard
not
a
not
a
loon
not
a
said
a
word
and
i
waited
for
a
sign
coals
and
cinders
nothing
more
and
a
little
cloud
of
smoke
floating
on
a
valley
floor
and
i
peered
into
the
smoke
till
it
rotted
like
a
fog
there
encompassed
round
by
fire
stood
a
in
a
bog
little
flames
came
wading
out
straining
straining
towards
its
stem
but
it
was
so
blue
and
tall
that
it
scorned
to
think
of
them
red
and
thirsty
were
their
tongues
as
the
tongues
of
wolves
must
be
but
it
was
so
blue
and
tall
oh
i
laughed
i
cried
to
see
all
my
heart
became
a
tear
all
my
soul
became
a
tower
never
loved
i
anything
as
i
loved
that
tall
blue
flower
it
was
all
the
little
boats
that
had
ever
sailed
the
sea
it
was
all
the
little
books
that
had
gone
to
school
with
me
on
its
roots
like
iron
claws
rearing
up
so
blue
and
tall
it
was
all
the
gallant
earth
with
its
back
against
a
wall
in
a
breath
ere
i
had
breathed
oh
i
laughed
i
cried
to
see
i
was
kneeling
at
its
side
and
it
leaned
its
head
on
me
crumbling
stones
and
sliding
sand
is
the
road
to
heaven
now
icy
at
my
straining
knees
drags
the
awful
soon
but
of
dust
will
the
road
to
heaven
be
father
son
and
holy
ghost
reach
a
hand
and
rescue
me
there
there
my
flower
hush
hush
go
to
sleep
that
is
only
god
you
hear
counting
up
his
folded
sheep
lullabye
lullabye
that
is
only
god
that
calls
missing
me
seeking
me
ere
the
road
to
nothing
falls
he
will
set
his
mighty
feet
firmly
on
the
sliding
sand
like
a
little
frightened
bird
i
will
creep
into
his
hand
i
will
tell
him
all
my
grief
i
will
tell
him
all
my
sin
he
will
give
me
half
his
robe
for
a
cloak
to
wrap
you
in
lullabye
lullabye
rocks
the
planet
free
father
son
and
holy
ghost
reach
a
hand
and
rescue
me
ah
the
voice
of
love
at
last
lo
at
last
the
face
of
light
and
the
whole
of
his
white
robe
for
a
cloak
against
the
night
and
upon
my
heart
asleep
all
the
things
i
ever
knew
holds
heaven
not
some
cranny
lord
for
a
flower
so
tall
and
blue
all
well
and
all
well
gay
the
lights
of
heaven
show
in
some
moist
and
heavenly
place
we
will
set
it
out
to
grow
journey
ah
could
i
lay
me
down
in
this
long
grass
and
close
my
eyes
and
let
the
quiet
wind
blow
over
me
i
am
so
tired
so
tired
of
passing
pleasant
places
all
my
life
following
care
along
the
dusty
road
have
i
looked
back
at
loveliness
and
sighed
yet
at
my
hand
an
unrelenting
hand
tugged
ever
and
i
passed
all
my
life
long
over
my
shoulder
have
i
looked
at
peace
and
now
i
fain
would
lie
in
this
long
grass
and
close
my
eyes
yet
onward
cat
birds
call
through
the
long
afternoon
and
creeks
at
dusk
are
guttural
wake
and
cry
drawing
the
twilight
close
about
their
throats
only
my
heart
makes
answer
eager
vines
go
up
the
rocks
and
wait
flushed
pause
in
their
dance
and
break
the
ring
for
me
dim
shady
redolent
of
fern
and
bayberry
that
through
sweet
bevies
thread
of
roses
pink
and
petulant
look
back
and
beckon
ere
they
disappear
only
my
heart
only
my
heart
responds
yet
ah
my
path
is
sweet
on
either
side
all
through
the
dragging
day
sharp
underfoot
and
hot
and
like
dead
mist
the
dry
dust
hangs
but
far
oh
far
as
passionate
eye
can
reach
and
long
ah
long
as
rapturous
eye
can
cling
the
world
is
mine
blue
hill
still
silver
lake
broad
field
bright
flower
and
the
long
white
road
a
gateless
garden
and
an
open
path
my
feet
to
follow
and
my
heart
to
hold
no
matter
what
i
say
all
that
i
really
love
is
the
rain
that
flattens
on
the
bay
and
the
in
the
cove
the
that
lie
and
bleach
at
the
and
the
trace
of
higher
tides
along
the
beach
nothing
in
this
place
elegy
before
death
there
will
be
rose
and
rhododendron
when
you
are
dead
and
under
ground
still
will
be
heard
from
white
syringas
heavy
with
bees
a
sunny
sound
still
will
the
tamaracks
be
raining
after
the
rain
has
ceased
and
still
will
there
be
robins
in
the
stubble
brown
sheep
upon
the
warm
green
hill
spring
will
not
ail
nor
autumn
falter
nothing
will
know
that
you
are
gone
saving
alone
some
sullen
none
but
yourself
sets
foot
upon
saving
the
and
the
nothing
will
know
that
you
are
dead
these
and
perhaps
a
useless
wagon
standing
beside
some
tumbled
shed
oh
there
will
pass
with
your
great
passing
little
of
beauty
not
your
own
only
the
light
from
common
water
only
the
grace
from
simple
stone
the
ho
giant
this
is
i
i
have
built
me
a
into
your
sky
la
but
it
lovely
up
so
high
this
is
how
i
came
i
put
here
my
knee
there
my
foot
up
and
up
from
shoot
to
shoot
and
the
blessed
thinning
like
the
mischief
all
the
time
till
it
took
me
rocking
spinning
in
a
dizzy
sunny
circle
making
angles
with
the
root
far
and
out
above
the
cackle
of
the
city
i
was
born
in
till
the
little
dirty
city
in
the
light
so
sheer
and
sunny
shone
as
dazzling
bright
and
pretty
as
the
money
that
you
find
in
a
dream
of
finding
money
what
a
wind
what
a
morning
till
the
tiny
shiny
city
when
i
shot
a
glance
below
shaken
with
a
giddy
laughter
sick
and
blissfully
afraid
was
a
on
a
blade
and
a
pair
of
moments
after
was
the
whirling
guess
i
made
and
the
wind
was
like
a
whip
cracking
past
my
icy
ears
and
my
hair
stood
out
behind
and
my
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
cold
more
tears
than
they
could
hold
the
wind
was
blowing
so
and
my
teeth
were
in
a
row
dry
and
grinning
and
i
felt
my
foot
slip
and
i
scratched
the
wind
and
whined
and
i
clutched
the
stalk
and
jabbered
with
my
eyes
shut
blind
what
a
wind
what
a
wind
your
broad
sky
giant
is
the
shelf
of
a
cupboard
i
make
a
builder
like
yourself
but
is
my
trade
i
could
make
a
shelf
do
know
how
they
made
now
a
is
more
pliant
la
what
a
climb
weeds
white
with
daisies
and
red
with
sorrel
and
empty
empty
under
the
sky
life
is
a
quest
and
love
a
quarrel
here
is
a
place
for
me
to
lie
daisies
spring
from
damned
seeds
and
this
red
fire
that
here
i
see
is
a
worthless
crop
of
crimson
weeds
cursed
by
farmers
thriftily
but
here
unhated
for
an
hour
the
sorrel
runs
in
ragged
flame
the
daisy
stands
a
bastard
flower
like
flowers
that
bear
an
honest
name
and
here
a
while
where
no
wind
brings
the
baying
of
a
pack
athirst
may
sleep
the
sleep
of
blessed
things
the
blood
too
bright
the
brow
accurst
passer
mortuus
est
death
devours
all
lovely
things
lesbia
with
her
sparrow
shares
the
darkness
presently
every
bed
is
narrow
unremembered
as
old
rain
dries
the
sheer
libation
and
the
little
petulant
hand
is
an
annotation
after
all
my
erstwhile
dear
my
no
longer
cherished
need
we
say
it
was
not
love
now
that
love
is
perished
pastoral
if
it
were
only
still
with
far
away
the
shrill
crying
of
a
cock
or
the
shaken
bell
from
a
cow
throat
moving
through
the
bushes
or
the
soft
shock
of
wizened
apples
falling
from
an
old
tree
in
a
forgotten
orchard
upon
the
hilly
rock
oh
grey
hill
where
the
grazing
herd
licks
the
purple
blossom
crops
the
spiky
weed
oh
stony
pasture
where
the
tall
mullein
stands
up
so
sturdy
on
its
little
seed
assault
i
i
had
forgotten
how
the
frogs
must
sound
after
a
year
of
silence
else
i
think
i
should
not
so
have
ventured
forth
alone
at
dusk
upon
this
unfrequented
road
ii
i
am
waylaid
by
beauty
who
will
walk
between
me
and
the
crying
of
the
frogs
oh
savage
beauty
suffer
me
to
pass
that
am
a
timid
woman
on
her
way
from
one
house
to
another
travel
the
railroad
track
is
miles
away
and
the
day
is
loud
with
voices
speaking
yet
there
is
a
train
goes
by
all
day
but
i
hear
its
whistle
shrieking
all
night
there
is
a
train
goes
by
though
the
night
is
still
for
sleep
and
dreaming
but
i
see
its
cinders
red
on
the
sky
and
hear
its
engine
steaming
my
heart
is
warm
with
the
friends
i
make
and
better
friends
i
not
be
knowing
yet
there
is
a
train
i
would
take
no
matter
where
it
going
these
wet
rocks
where
the
tide
has
been
barnacled
white
and
weeded
brown
and
slimed
beneath
to
a
beautiful
green
these
wet
rocks
where
the
tide
went
down
will
show
again
when
the
tide
is
high
faint
and
perilous
far
from
shore
no
place
to
dream
but
a
place
to
die
the
bottom
of
the
sea
once
more
there
was
a
child
that
wandered
through
a
giant
empty
house
all
day
house
full
of
wonderful
things
and
new
but
no
fit
place
for
a
child
to
play
song
of
a
second
april
april
this
year
not
otherwise
than
april
of
a
year
ago
is
full
of
whispers
full
of
sighs
of
dazzling
mud
and
dingy
snow
hepaticas
that
pleased
you
so
are
here
again
and
butterflies
there
rings
a
hammering
all
day
and
shingles
lie
about
the
doors
in
orchards
near
and
far
away
the
grey
taps
and
bores
the
men
are
merry
at
their
chores
and
children
earnest
at
their
play
the
larger
streams
run
still
and
deep
noisy
and
swift
the
small
brooks
run
among
the
mullein
stalks
the
sheep
go
up
the
hillside
in
the
sun
pensively
only
you
are
gone
you
that
alone
i
cared
to
keep
rosemary
for
the
sake
of
some
things
that
be
now
no
more
i
will
strew
rushes
on
my
i
will
plant
bergamot
at
my
for
the
sake
of
dim
things
that
were
once
so
plain
i
will
set
a
barrel
out
to
catch
the
rain
i
will
hang
an
iron
pot
on
an
iron
crane
many
things
be
dead
and
gone
that
were
brave
and
gay
for
the
sake
of
these
things
i
will
learn
to
say
an
it
please
you
gentle
sirs
alack
and
the
poet
and
his
book
down
you
mongrel
death
back
into
your
kennel
i
have
stolen
breath
in
a
stalk
of
fennel
you
shall
scratch
and
you
shall
whine
many
a
night
and
you
shall
worry
many
a
bone
before
you
bury
one
sweet
bone
of
mine
when
shall
i
be
dead
when
my
flesh
is
withered
and
above
my
head
yellow
pollen
gathered
all
the
empty
afternoon
when
sweet
lovers
pause
and
wonder
who
am
i
that
lie
thereunder
hidden
from
the
moon
this
my
personal
death
that
lungs
be
failing
to
inhale
the
breath

are
exhaling

my
subtle
spirit

the
thawed
winter
splashes
over

chance
dust
and
ashes
weep
not
me
my
friend
me
by
no

dead
in

hour

surely
when
this
book
unread
rots
to
earth
obscurely
and
no
more
to
any
breast
close
against
the
clamorous
swelling
of
the
thing
there
is
no
telling
are
these
pages
pressed
when
this
book
is
mould
and
a
book
of
many
waiting
to
be
sold
for
a
casual
penny
in
a
little
open
case
in
a
street
unclean
and

a
heavy

steadfast
in

that
once
was

veins
are
weeds
when
these
hollowed
sockets

the
rooty
seeds
bursting
down
like
rockets
and
surmise
the
spring
again

remote
in
that
black
cupboard

the
pink

writhing
upward
at

are

the

i
watched
your

a

brought
my
plants
into
the

i
water
them
and
turn
them
south
i
snap
the
dead
brown
from
the
stem
but
it
is
winter
with
your
love
i
only
tend
and
water
them
there
was
a
time
i
stood
and
watched
the
small
sparrows
fray
i
loved
the
beggar
that
i
fed
i
cared
for
what
he
had
to

i
stood

watched
him

far

sat

sat

gossipped
with

thalia
knows
how
rare
a
thing
is
it
to
grow
old
and
sing
when

brown
and
tepid
tide
closes
in
on

side
who
shall

had

whom

you
haunting
that
you
haunt
my
door
surely
it
is
not
i
she
wanting
someone
living
here
before
nobody
in
the
house
but
me
you
may
come
in
if
you
like
and
see
thin
as
thread
with
exquisite
fingers
have
you
seen
her
any
of
you
grey
shawl
and
leaning
on
the
wind
and
the
garden
showing
through
glimmering
eyes
and
silent
mostly
sort
of
a
whisper
sort
of
a
purr
asking
something
asking
it
over
if
you
get
a
sound
from
ever
see
her
any
of
you
strangest
thing
i
ever
known
every
night

i
moved
in

i
came

hush
with
your
knocking
you
may
not
come
in
this

i
that
you
hear
rocking
nobody
with
me
nor
has
been
curious
how
she
tried
the
window
odd
the
way
she
tries
the
door
wonder
just
what
sort
of
people
could
have
had
this
house
before
ebb
i
know
what
my
heart
is
like
since
your
love
died
it
is
like
a
hollow
ledge
holding
a
little
pool
left
there
by
the
tide
a
little
tepid
pool
drying
inward
from
the
edge
elaine
oh
come
again
to
astolat
i
will
not
ask
you
to
be
kind
and
you
may
go
when
you
will
go
and
i
will
stay
behind
i
will
not
say
how
dear
you
are
or
ask
you
if
you
hold
me
dear
or
trouble
you
with
things
for
you
the
way
i
did
last
year
so
still
the

very
still
the

not

though
you
should
guess
what

me
so
wide
shall
be
the
the
so
very
wide
you
needs
must
think
if
you
should
think
the
lily
maid
had
died
save
that
a
little
way
away
i
watch
you
for
a
little
while
to
see
you
speak
the
way
you
speak
and
smile

mine

many
hundred
years
remember
greece
remember
rome
remember
mary
tears
and
far
away
in

sadder
than

band
over
the
indulgent
land
ah
for
in
this
dourest
sorest
age
man

has
looked
upon
death
to

and
death
to

still
the

to
raise

with

and

ivory
bowls
that

children
your

is
dead
from

though
good
men
die
anne
eat
your
breakfast
dan
take
your
medicine
life
must
go
on
i
forget
just
why
exiled
searching
my
heart
for
its
true
sorrow
this
is
the
thing
i
find
to
be
that
i
am
weary
of
words
and
people
sick
of
the
city
wanting
the
sea
wanting
the
sticky
salty
sweetness
of
the
strong
wind
and
shattered
spray
wanting
the
loud
sound
and
the
soft
sound
of
the
big
surf
that
breaks
all
day
always
before
about
my
dooryard
marking
the
reach
of
the
winter
sea
rooted
in
sand
and
dragging
straggled
the
purple
wild
always
i
climbed
the
wave
at
morning
shook
the
sand
from
my
shoes
at
night
that
now
am
caught
beneath
great
buildings
stricken
with
noise
confused
with
light
if
i
could
hear
the
green
piles
groaning
under
the
windy
wooden
piers
see
once
again
the
bobbing
barrels
and
the
black
sticks
that
fence
the
weirs
if
i
could
see
the
weedy
mussels
crusting
the
wrecked
and
rotting
hulls
hear
once
again
the
hungry
crying
overhead
of
the
wheeling
gulls
feel
once
again
the
shanty
straining
under
the
turning
of
the
tide
fear
once
again
the
rising
freshet
dread
the
bell
in
the
fog
outside
i
should
be
happy
that
was
happy
all
day
long
on
the
coast
of
maine
i
have
a
need
to
hold
and
handle
shells
and
anchors
and
ships
again
i
should
be
happy
that
am
happy
never
at
all
since
i
came
here
i
am
too
long
away
from
water
i
have
a
need
of
water
near
the
death
of
autumn
when
reeds
are
dead
and
a
straw
to
thatch
the
marshes
and
feathered
rides
into
the
wind
like
aged
warriors
westward
tragic
thinned
of
half
their
tribe
and
over
the
flattened
rushes
stripped
of
its
secret
open
stark
and
bleak
blackens
afar
the
creek
then
leans
on
me
the
weight
of
the
year
and
crushes
my
heart
i
know
that
beauty
must
ail
and
die
and
will
be
born
again
but
ah
to
see
beauty
stiffened
staring
up
at
the
sky
oh
autumn
autumn
what
is
the
spring
to
me
ode
to
silence
aye
but
she
your
other
sister
and
my
other
soul
grave
silence
lovelier
than
the
three
loveliest
maidens
what
of
her
clio
not
you
not
you
calliope
nor
all
your
wanton
line
not
beauty
perfect
self
shall
comfort
me
for
silence
once
departed
for
her
the
her
the
whom
evermore
i
follow
wistfully
wandering
heaven
and
earth
and
hell
and
the
four
seasons
through
thalia
not
you
not
you
melpomene
not
your
incomparable
feet
o
thin
terpsichore
i
seek
in
this
great
hall
but
one
more
pale
more
pensive
most
beloved
of
you
all
i
seek
her
from
afar
i
come
from
temples
where
her
altars
are
from
groves
that
bear
her
name
noisy
with
stricken
victims
now
and
sacrificial
flame
and
cymbals
struck
on
high
and
strident
faces
obstreperous
in
her
praise
they
neither
love
nor
know
a
goddess
of
gone
days
departed
long
ago
abandoning
the
invaded
shrines
and
fanes
of
her
old
sanctuary
a
deity
obscure
and
legendary
of
whom
there
now
remains
for
sages
to
decipher
and
priests
to
garble
only
and
for
a
little
while
her
letters
wedged
in
marble
which
even
now
behold
the
friendly
mumbling
rain
erases
and
the
inarticulate
snow
leaving
at
last
of
her
least
signs
and
traces
none
whatsoever
nor
whither
she
is
vanished
from
these
places
she
will
love
well
i
said
if
love
be
of
that
heart
inhabiter
the
flowers
of
the
dead
the
red
anemone
that
with
no
sound
moves
in
the
wind
and
from
another
wound
that
sprang
the
blue
hyacinth
that
blossoms
underground
and
sallow
poppies
will
be
dear
to
her
and
will
not
silence
know
in
the
black
shade
of
what
obsidian
steep
stiffens
the
white
narcissus
numb
with
sleep
seed
which
demeter
daughter
bore
from
home
uptorn
by
desperate
fingers
long
ago
reluctant
even
as
she
undone
persephone
and
even
as
she
set
out
again
to
grow
in
twilight
in
perdition
lean
and
inauspicious
loam
she
will
love
well
i
said
the
flowers
of
the
dead
where
dark
persephone
the
winter
round
uncomforted
for
home
uncomforted
lacking
a
sunny
southern
slope
in
northern
sicily
with
sullen
pupils
focussed
on
a
dream
stares
on
the
stagnant
stream
that
moats
the
unequivocable
battlements
of
hell
there
there
will
she
be
found
she
that
is
beauty
veiled
from
men
and
music
in
a
swound
i
long
for
silence
as
they
long
for
breath
whose
helpless
nostrils
drink
the
bitter
sea
what
thing
can
be
so
stout
what
so
redoubtable
in
death
what
fury
what
considerable
rage
if
only
she
upon
whose
icy
breast
unquestioned
uncaressed
one
time
i
lay
and
whom
always
i
lack
even
to
this
day
being
by
no
means
from
that
frigid
bosom
weaned
away
if
only
she
therewith
be
given
me
back
i
sought
her
down
that
dolorous
labyrinth
wherein
no
shaft
of
sunlight
ever
fell
and
in
among
the
bloodless
everywhere
i
sought
her
but
the
air
breathed
many
times
and
spent
was
fretful
with
a
whispering
discontent
and
questioning
me
importuning
me
to
tell
some
slightest
tidings
of
the
light
of
day
they
know
no
more
plucking
my
sleeve
the
eager
shades
were
with
me
where
i
went
i
paused
at
every
grievous
door
and
harked
a
moment
holding
up
my
hand
and
for
a
space
a
hush
was
on
them
while
they
watched
my
face
and
then
they
fell
as
before
so
that
i
smiled
at
them
and
left
them
seeing
she
was
not
there
i
sought
her
too
among
the
upper
gods
although
i
knew
she
was
not
like
to
be
where
feasting
is
nor
near
to
heaven
lord
being
a
thing
abhorred
and
shunned
of
him
although
a
child
of
his
not
yours
not
yours
to
you
she
owes
not
breath
mother
of
song
being
sown
of
zeus
upon
a
dream
of
death
fearing
to
pass
unvisited
some
place
and
later
learn
too
late
how
all
the
while
with
her
still
face
she
had
been
standing
there
and
seen
me
pass
without
a
smile
i
sought
her
even
to
the
sagging
board
whereat
the
stout
immortals
sat
but
such
a
laughter
shook
the
mighty
hall
no
one
could
hear
me
say
had
she
been
seen
upon
the
hill
that
day
and
no
one
knew
at
all
how
long
i
stood
or
when
at
last
i
sighed
and
went
away
there
is
a
garden
lying
in
a
lull
between
the
mountains
and
the
mountainous
sea
i
know
not
where
but
which
a
dream
diurnal
paints
on
my
lids
a
moment
till
the
hull
be
lifted
from
the
kernel
and
slumber
fed
to
me
your
is
not
there
mnemosene
though
it
would
seem
a
ruined
place
and
after
your
lichenous
heart
being
full
of
broken
columns
caryatides
thrown
to
the
earth
and
fallen
forward
on
their
jointless
knees
and
urns
funereal
altered
into
dust
minuter
than
the
ashes
of
the
dead
and
psyche
lamp
out
of
the
earth
dripping
itself
in
marble
wax
on
what
was
once
the
bed
of
love
and
his
young
body
asleep
but
now
is
dust
instead
there
twists
the
the
white
wisteria
fastens
its
fingers
in
the
strangling
wall
and
the
wide
crannies
quicken
with
bright
weeds
there
dumbly
like
a
worm
all
day
the
still
white
orchid
feeds
but
never
an
echo
of
your
daughters
laughter
is
there
nor
any
sign
of
you
at
all
swells
fungous
from
the
rotten
bough
grey
mother
of
pieria
only
her
shadow
once
upon
a
stone
i
saw
and
lo
the
shadow
and
the
garden
too
were
gone
i
tell
you
you
have
done
her
body
an
ill
you
chatterers
you
noisy
crew
she
is
not
anywhere
i
sought
her
in
deep
hell
and
through
the
world
as
well
i
thought
of
heaven
and
i
sought
her
there
above
nor
under
ground
is
silence
to
be
found
that
was
the
very
warp
and
woof
of
you
lovely
before
your
songs
began
and
after
they
were
through
oh
say
if
on
this
hill
somewhere
your
sister
body
lies
in
death
so
i
may
follow
there
and
make
a
wreath
of
my
locked
hands
that
on
her
quiet
breast
shall
lie
till
age
has
withered
them
ah
sweetly
from
the
rest
i
see
turn
and
consider
me
compassionate
euterpe
there
is
a
gate
beyond
the
gate
of
death
beyond
the
gate
of
everlasting
life
beyond
the
gates
of
heaven
and
hell
she
saith
whereon
but
to
believe
is
horror
whereon
to
meditate
engendereth
even
in
deathless
spirits
such
as
i
a
tumult
in
the
breath
a
chilling
of
the
inexhaustible
blood
even
in
my
veins
that
never
will
be
dry
and
in
the
austere
divine
monotony
that
is
my
being
the
madness
of
an
unaccustomed
mood
this
is
her
province
whom
you
lack
and
seek
and
seek
her
not
elsewhere
hell
is
a
thoroughfare
for
pilgrims
herakles
and
he
that
loved
euridice
too
well
have
walked
therein
and
many
more
than
these
and
witnessed
the
desire
and
the
despair
of
souls
that
passed
reluctantly
and
sicken
for
the
air
you
too
have
entered
hell
and
issued
thence
but
thence
whereof
i
speak
none
has
returned
for
thither
fury
brings
only
the
driven
ghosts
of
them
that
flee
before
all
things
oblivion
is
the
name
of
this
abode
and
she
is
there
oh
radiant
song
oh
gracious
memory
be
long
upon
this
height
i
shall
not
climb
again
i
know
the
way
you
mean
the
little
night
and
the
long
empty
day
never
to
see
again
the
angry
light
or
hear
the
hungry
noises
cry
my
brain
ah
but
she
your
other
sister
and
my
other
soul
she
shall
again
be
mine
and
i
shall
drink
her
from
a
silver
bowl
a
chilly
thin
green
wine
not
bitter
to
the
taste
not
sweet
not
of
your
press
oh
restless
clamorous
nine
to
foam
beneath
the
frantic
hoofs
of
mirth
but
savoring
faintly
of
the
acid
earth
and
trod
by
pensive
feet
from
perfect
clusters
ripened
without
haste
out
of
the
urgent
heat
in
some
clear
glimmering
vaulted
twilight
under
the
odorous
vine
lift
up
your
lyres
sing
on
but
as
for
me
i
seek
your
sister
whither
she
is
gone
memorial
to
vassar
college
oh
loveliest
throat
of
all
sweet
throats
where
now
no
more
the
music
is
with
hands
that
wrote
you
little
notes
i
write
you
little
elegies
epitaph
heap
not
on
this
mound
roses
that
she
loved
so
well
why
bewilder
her
with
roses
that
she
can
not
see
or
smell
she
is
happy
where
she
lies
with
the
dust
upon
her
eyes

persephone

to
her
persephone
all
the
things
i
might
not

her

upon
your
knee
she
that
was
so
proud
and
wild
flippant
arrogant
and
free
she
that
had
no
need
of
me
is
a
little
lonely
child
lost
in
hell
persephone

her

upon
your
knee

to
her
my
dear
my
dear
it
is
not
so
dreadful
here

away

no

her
fragrant
gowns
take
them
all
down

dance
no

her
narrow
shoes
from
the

let
them
bury
your
big
eyes
in
the
secret
earth
securely
your
thin
fingers
and
your
fair
soft
hair
all
of
these
in
some
way
surely
from
the
secret
earth
shall
rise
not
for
these
i
sit
and
stare
broken
and
bereft
completely
your
young
flesh
that
sat
so
neatly
on
your
little
bones
will
sweetly
blossom
in
the
air
but
your
voice
never
the
rushing
of
a
river
underground
not
the
rising
of
the
wind
in
the
trees
before
the
rain
not
the
woodcock
watery
call
not
the
note
the
utters
not
the
feet
of
children
pushing
yellow
leaves
along
the
gutters
in
the
blue
and
bitter
fall
shall
content
my
musing
mind
for
the
beauty
of
that
sound
that
in
no
new
way
at
all
ever
will
be
heard
again
sweetly
through
the
sappy
stalk
of
the
vigorous
weed
holding
all
it
held
before
cherished
by
the
faithful
sun
on
and
on
eternally
shall
your
altered
fluid
run
bud
and
bloom
and
go
to
seed
but
your
singing
days
are
done
but
the
music
of
your
talk
never
shall
the
chemistry
of
the
secret
earth
restore
all
your
lovely
words
are
spoken
once
the
ivory
box
is
broken

the
golden
bird
no

your
weeping
now
all
you
loved
of

to

the
arrogant
brow
and
the
withering
tongue
chastened

your
weeping

whatever
songs

whatever

we

thick
about
us

how
rankly
grow
those
subtle
weeds
no
man
has
need
to
tend
that
flourish
through
neglect
and
soon
must
send
perfume
too
sweet
upon
us

overthrow
our
steady
senses
how
such
matters
go
we
are
aware
and
how
such
matters
end

shall
be
told
no

us

let

with

churning
blood

long
shuddering
quiet
the
desperate
hot
palms

escaping

still
on
nettles
in
the
open
sigh
the
minstrel
that
in
slumber
is
as
mute
as
any
man

far
and
high

forsakes
the
topmost
branch
a
fruit
found
on
the
ground
by
every
iii
not
with
libations
but
with
shouts
and
laughter
we
drenched
the
altars
of
love
sacred
grove
shaking
to
earth
green
fruits
impatient
after
the
launching
of
the
colored
moths
of
love
love
proper
myrtle
and
his
mother
zone
we
bound
about
our
irreligious
brows
and
fettered
him
with
garlands
of
our
own
and
spread
a
banquet
in
his
frugal
house
not
yet
the
god
has
spoken
but
i
fear
though
we
should
break
our
bodies
in
his
flame
and
pour
our
blood
upon
his
altar
here
henceforward
is
a
grove
without
a
name
a
pasture
to
the
shaggy
goats
of
pan
whence
flee
forever
a
woman
and
a
man
iv
only
until
this
cigarette
is
ended
a
little
moment
at
the
end
of
all
while
on
the
floor
the
quiet
ashes
fall
and
in
the
firelight
to
a
lance
extended
bizarrely
with
the
jazzing
music
blended
the
broken
shadow
dances
on
the
wall
i
will
permit
my
memory
to
recall
the
vision
of
you
by
all
my
dreams
attended
and
then
adieu
farewell
the
dream
is
done
yours
is
a
face
of
which
i
can
forget
the
color
and
the
features
every
one
the
words
not
ever
and
the
smiles
not
yet
but
in
your
day
this
moment
is
the
sun
upon
a
hill
after
the
sun
has
set
v
once
more
into
my
arid
days
like
dew
like
wind
from
an
oasis
or
the
sound
of
cold
sweet
water
bubbling
underground
a
treacherous
messenger
the
thought
of
you
comes
to
destroy
me
once
more
i
renew
firm
faith
in
your
abundance
whom
i
found
long
since
to
be
but
just
one
other
mound
of
sand
whereon
no
green
thing
ever
grew
and
once
again
and
wiser
in
no
wise
i
chase
your
colored
phantom
on
the
air
and
sob
and
curse
and
fall
and
weep
and
rise
and
stumble
pitifully
on
to
where
miserable
and
lost
with
stinging
eyes
once
more
i
clasp
and
there
is
nothing
there
vi
no
rose
that
in
a
garden
ever
grew
in
homer
or
in
omar
or
in
mine
though
buried
under
centuries
of
fine
dead
dust
of
roses
shut
from
sun
and
dew
forever
and
forever
lost
from
view
but
must
again
in
fragrance
rich
as
wine
the
grey
aisles
of
the
air
incarnadine
when
the
old
summers
surge
into
a
new
thus
when
i
swear
i
love
with
all
my
heart
is
with
the
heart
of
lilith
that
i
swear
is
with
the
love
of
lesbia
and
lucrece
and
thus
as
well
my
love
must
lose
some
part
of
what
it
is
had
helen
been
less
fair
or
perished
young
or
stayed
at
home
in
greece
vii
when
i
too
long
have
looked
upon
your
face
wherein
for
me
a
brightness
unobscured
save
by
the
mists
of
brightness
has
its
place
and
terrible
beauty
not
to
be
endured
i
turn
away
reluctant
from
your
light
and
stand
irresolute
a
mind
undone
a
silly
dazzled
thing
deprived
of
sight
from
having
looked
too
long
upon
the
sun
then
is
my
daily
life
a
narrow
room
in
which
a
little
while
uncertainly
surrounded
by
impenetrable
gloom
among
familiar
things
grown
strange
to
me
making
my
way
i
pause
and
feel
and
hark
till
i
become
accustomed
to
the
dark
viii
and
you
as
well
must
die
beloved
dust
and
all
your
beauty
stand
you
in
no
stead
this
flawless
vital
hand
this
perfect
head
this
body
of
flame
and
steel
before
the
gust
of
death
or
under
his
autumnal
frost
shall
be
as
any
leaf
be
no
less
dead
than
the
first
leaf
that
fell
this
wonder
fled
altered
estranged
disintegrated
lost
nor
shall
my
love
avail
you
in
your
hour
in
spite
of
all
my
love
you
will
arise
upon
that
day
and
wander
down
the
air
obscurely
as
the
unattended
flower
it
mattering
not
how
beautiful
you
were
or
how
beloved
above
all
else
that
dies
ix
let
you
not
say
of
me
when
i
am
old
in
pretty
worship
of
my
withered
hands
forgetting
who
i
am
and
how
the
sands
of
such
a
life
as
mine
run
red
and
gold
even
to
the
ultimate
sifting
dust
behold
here
walketh
passionless
age
for
there
expands
a
curious
superstition
in
these
lands
and
by
its
leave
some
weightless
tales
are
told
in
me
no
lenten
wicks
watch
out
the
night
i
am
the
booth
where
folly
holds
her
fair
impious
no
less
in
ruin
than
in
strength
when
i
lie
crumbled
to
the
earth
at
length
let
you
not
say
upon
this
reverend
site
the
righteous
groaned
and
beat
their
breasts
in
prayer
x
oh
my
beloved
have
you
thought
of
this
how
in
the
years
to
come
unscrupulous
time
more
cruel
than
death
will
tear
you
from
my
kiss
and
make
you
old
and
leave
me
in
my
prime
how
you
and
i
who
scale
together
yet
a
little
while
the
sweet
immortal
height
no
pilgrim
may
remember
or
forget
as
sure
as
the
world
turns
some
granite
night
shall
lie
awake
and
know
the
gracious
flame
gone
out
forever
on
the
mutual
stone
and
call
to
mind
that
on
the
day
you
came
i
was
a
child
and
you
a
hero
grown
and
the
night
pass
and
the
strange
morning
break
upon
our
anguish
for
each
other
sake
xi
as
to
some
lovely
temple
tenantless
long
since
that
once
was
sweet
with
shivering
brass
knowing
well
its
altars
ruined
and
the
grass
grown
up
between
the
stones
yet
from
excess
of
grief
hard
driven
or
great
loneliness
the
worshiper
returns
and
those
who
pass
marvel
him
crying
on
a
name
that
was
so
is
it
now
with
me
in
my
distress
your
body
was
a
temple
to
delight
cold
are
its
ashes
whence
the
breath
is
fled
yet
here
one
time
your
spirit
was
wont
to
move
here
might
i
hope
to
find
you
day
or
night
and
here
i
come
to
look
for
you
my
love
even
now
foolishly
knowing
you
are
dead
xii
cherish
you
then
the
hope
i
shall
forget
at
length
my
lord
pieria
put
away
for
your
so
passing
sake
this
mouth
of
clay
these
mortal
bones
against
my
body
set
for
all
the
puny
fever
and
frail
sweat
of
human
love
renounce
for
these
i
say
the
singing
mountain
memory
and
betray
the
silent
lyre
that
hangs
upon
me
yet
ah
but
indeed
some
day
shall
you
awake
rather
from
dreams
of
me
that
at
your
side
so
many
nights
a
lover
and
a
bride
but
stern
in
my
soul
chastity
have
lain
to
walk
the
world
forever
for
my
sake
and
in
each
chamber
find
me
gone
again
wild
swans
i
looked
in
my
heart
while
the
wild
swans
went
over
and
what
did
i
see
i
had
not
seen
before
only
a
question
less
or
a
question
more
nothing
to
match
the
flight
of
wild
birds
flying
tiresome
heart
forever
living
and
dying
house
without
air
i
leave
you
and
lock
your
door
wild
swans
come
over
the
town
come
over
the
town
again
trailing
your
legs
and
crying
