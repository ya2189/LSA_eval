i
have
seen
at
harvest
festival
in
a
white
church
how
the
poor
folk
lacking
fine
decorations
offer
the
of
their
various
toils
not
only
fruit
and
blossom
of
the
fields
ripe
corn
and
poppies
scabious
marguerites
melons
and
marrows
carrots
and
potatoes
and
pale
round
turnips
and
sweet
cottage
flowers
but
gifts
of
other
produce
heaped
brown
nets
fine
pollack
silver
fish
with
umber
backs
and
handsome
mackerel
and
uglier
hornier
creatures
from
the
sea
lobsters
and
eyed
and
smooth
flat
crabs
ranged
with
the
flowers
upon
the
to
lie
in
that
symbolic
contiguity
while
lusty
hymns
of
gratitude
i
here
offer
all
i
have
found
a
few
bright
stainless
flowers
and
richer
earthlier
blooms
and
homely
grain
and
roots
that
grew
distorted
in
the
dark
and
shapes
of
livid
hue
and
sprawling
form
dragged
from
the
deepest
maters
i
have
searched
most
diverse
gifts
yet
all
alike
in
this
they
are
all
the
natural
products
of
my
mind
and
heart
and
senses
and
all
with
labour
grown
or
plucked
or
preface
the
title
of
this
book
was
chosen
for
this
reason
had
the
volume
been
called
other
it
might
have
given
a
false
impression
that
its
contents
were
entirely
new
had
it
been
called
the
equally
false
impression
might
have
been
given
that
there
was
something
of
finality
about
it
the
title
selected
seemed
best
to
convey
both
the
fact
that
it
was
a
collection
and
that
under
providence
other
and
let
us
hope
superior
collections
will
follow
it
the
book
contains
all
that
i
do
not
wish
to
destroy
of
the
contents
of
four
volumes
of
verse
a
number
of
small
corrections
have
been
made
there
are
added
also
a
few
recent
poems
not
previously
published
the
earliest
of
the
poems
now
reprinted
is
dated
in
which
year
i
was
some
of
the
subsequent
years
such
as
and
contributed
nothing
to
this
book
the
greater
number
of
the
poems
were
written
in
and
some
of
the
poems
were
not
written
as
i
should
now
write
them
and
many
of
them
reflect
transient
though
mostly
recurrent
moods
which
i
do
not
necessarily
think
worthy
of
esteem

the

and

within

is
neither

nor

nor

nor

for
the
brain
strives
not
to
the
goal
of
thought
and
the
limbs
lie
wearied
and
all
desire
sleeps
for
a
while
and
i
am
naught
but
a
pair
of
eyes
that
gaze
at
a
fire
a
day
i
morning
the
village
fades
away
where
i
last
night
came
where
they
housed
me
and
fed
me
and
never
asked
my
name
the
sun
shines
bright
my
step
is
light
i
who
have
no
abode
jeer
at
the
stuck
monotonous
black
posts
along
the
road
ii
midday
the
wood
is
still
as
here
i
sit
my
heart
drinks
in
the
peace
of
it
a
something
stirs
i
know
not
where
some
quiet
spirit
in
the
air
o
tall
straight
stems
o
cool
deep
green
o
hand
unfelt
o
face
unseen
iii
evening
the
evening
closes
in
as
down
this
last
long
lane
i
plod
there
patter
round
first
heavy
drops
of
rain
feet
ache
legs
ache
but
now
step
quickens
as
i
think
of
mounds
of
bread
and
cheese
and
something
hot
to
drink
iv
night
ah
sleep
is
sweet
but
yet
i
will
not
sleep
awhile
nor
for
a
space
forget
the
toil
of
that
last
mile
but
lie
awake
and
feel
the
cool
sheets
tremulous
kisses
all
my
body
steal
is
sleep
as
sweet
as
this
is
the
roof
i
when
the
clouds
hide
the
sun
away
the
tall
slate
roof
is
dull
and
grey
and
when
the
rain
adown
it
streams
is
polished
lead
with
gleams
when
the
clouds
vanish
and
the
rain
stops
and
the
sun
comes
out
again
it
shimmers
golden
in
the
sun
almost
too
bright
to
look
upon
but
soon
beneath
the
steady
rays
the
roof
is
dried
and
reft
of
blaze
is
dusty
yellow
traversed
through
by
long
thin
lines
of
deepest
blue
then
at
the
last
as
night
draws
near
the
lines
grow
faint
and
disappear
the
roof
becomes
a
purple
mist
a
great
square
darkening
amethyst
which
sinks
into
the
gathering
shade
till
separate
form
and
colour
fade
and
it
is
but
a
patch
which
mars
the
beauty
of
a
field
of
stars
ii
it
stands
so
lonely
in
the
sky
the
sparrows
never
come
thereby
the
glossy
starlings
seldom
stop
to
preen
and
chatter
on
the
top
for
a
whole
week
sometimes
up
there
no
stirs
the
quiet
air
the
roof
lies
silent
and
serene
as
though
no
life
had
ever
been
till
some
bright
afternoon
athwart
the
edge
two
sudden
shadows
dart
and
two
white
pigeons
with
pink
feet
flutter
above
and
pitch
on
it
jerking
their
necks
out
as
they
walk
they
talk
awhile
their
a
low
continuous
murmur
blent
of
mock
reproaches
and
content
then
cease
and
sit
there
warm
and
white
an
hour
till
in
the
fading
light
they
wake
and
know
the
close
of
day
flutter
above
and
fly
away
leaving
the
roof
whereon
they
sat
as
was
before
a
peaceful
flat
expanse
as
silent
and
serene
as
though
no
life
had
ever
been
town
mostly
in
a
dull
rotation
we
bear
our
loads
and
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
feeling
no
tears
knowing
no
meditation
too
tired
to
think
too
clogged
with
earth
to
weep
dimly
convinced
poor
groping
wretches
like
eyeless
insects
in
a
murky
pond
that
out
and
out
this
city
stretches
away
away
and
there
is
no
beyond
no
larger
earth
no
loftier
heaven
no
cleaner
gentler
airs
to
breathe
and
yet
even
to
us
sometimes
is
given
visions
of
things
we
other
times
forget
some
day
is
done
its
labour
ended
and
as
we
sit
and
brood
at
windows
high
a
steady
wind
from
far
descended
blows
off
the
filth
that
hid
the
deeper
sky
there
are
the
empty
waiting
spaces
we
watch
we
watch
unwinking
pale
and
dumb
till
gliding
up
with
noiseless
paces
night
covers
all
the
wide
arch
night
has
come
not
that
sick
false
night
of
the
city
lurid
and
low
and
yellow
and
obscene
but
mother
night
pure
full
of
pity
the
night
blue
potent
and
serene
o
as
we
gaze
the
clamour
ceases
the
turbid
world
around
grows
dim
and
small
the
influence
releases
our
shrouded
spirits
from
their
dusty
pall
no
more
we
hear
the
turbulent
traffic
not
scorned
but
unremembered
is
the
day
the
night
all
luminous
and
seraphic
has
brushed
its
heavy
memories
away
the
great
blue
night
so
clear
and
kindly
the
little
stars
so
and
so
still
open
a
door
for
souls
that
blindly
had
wandered
tunnelling
the
endless
hill
they
draw
the
portal
our
souls
slip
out
and
tremble
and
expand
the
immortal
feels
for
the
immortal
the
eternal
holds
the
eternal
by
the
hand
impalpably
we
are
led
and
lifted
softly
we
shake
into
the
gulf
of
blue
the
last
environing
veil
is
rifted
and
lost
horizons
float
into
our
view
lost
lands
lone
seas
lands
that
afar
gleam
with
a
miraculous
beauty
faint
yet
clear
forgotten
lands
of
night
and
seas
that
are
somewhere
but
that
are
not
here
borne
without
effort
or
endeavour
swifter
and
more
ethereal
than
the
wind
in
level
track
we
stream
whilst
ever
the
fair
pale
panorama
rolls
behind
now
fleets
below
a
tranc√®d
moorland
a
sweep
of
glimmering
immobility
now
craggy
cliff
and
dented
foreland
pass
back
and
there
beyond
unfolds
the
sea
now
wastes
of
water
heaving
drawing
great
darkling
tracts
of
patterned
restlessness
with
whitened
waves
round
rough
rocks
mawing
and
licking
islands
in
their
fierce
caress
now
coasts
with
capes
and
ribboned
beaches
set
silent
the
canopy
sapphirine
and
estuaries
and
river
reaches
phantasmal
silver
in
the
night
soft
shine
ah
these
fair
woods
the
spirit
crosses
these
quiet
lakes
these
stretched
dreaming
fields
these
undulate
downs
with
piny
bosses
pointing
the
ridges
of
their
sloping
shields
these
valleys
and
these
heights
that
screen
them
these
tawnier
sands
where
grass
and
tree
are
not
ah
we
have
known
them
we
have
seen
them
we
saw
them
long
ago
and
we
forgot
we
know
them
all
these
placid
countries
and
what
the
pathway
is
and
what
the
goal
these
are
the
gates
and
these
the
sentries
that
guard
that
ancient
fortress
of
the
soul
and
we
speed
onward
flying
flying
over
the
sundering
waves
of
hill
and
plain
to
where
they
rear
their
heads
undying
the
unnamed
mountains
of
old
days
again
the
snows
upon
their
calm
still
summits
the
chasms
the
files
of
trees
that
foot
the
snow
curving
like
inky
frozen
comets
into
the
spread
below
the
glisten
where
the
peaks
are
hoarest
the
soundless
darkness
of
the
sunken
vales
the
folding
leagues
of
shadowy
forest
edge
beyond
edge
till
all
distinctness
fails
so
invulnerable
it
is
so
deathless
so
floods
the
air
the
loveliness
of
it
that
we
stay
dazzled
rapt
and
breathless
our
beings
ebbing
to
the
infinite
there
as
we
pause
there
as
we
hover
in
ecstasy
a
sudden
light
breaks
in
our
eyes
and
we
discover
we
sit
at
windows
gazing
to
the
night
wistful
and
tired
with
eyes
where
still
the
sting
of
beauty
faintly
smarts
but
with
our
mute
regrets
there
mingle
thanks
for
the
resurrection
of
our
hearts
o
night
so
great
that
will
not
mock
us
o
stars
so
wise
that
understand
the
weak
o
vast
consoling
hands
that
rock
us
o
strong
and
perfect
tongues
that
speak
o
night
enrobed
in
azure
splendour
o
whispering
stars
whose
radiance
falls
like
dew
o
mighty
presences
and
tender
you
have
given
us
back
the
dreams
our
childhood
knew
lulled
by
your
visions
without
number
we
seek
our
beds
content
and
void
of
pain
and
dreaming
drowse
and
dreaming
slumber
and
dreaming
wake
to
see
the
day
again
friendship
garland
i
when
i
was
a
boy
there
was
a
friend
of
mine
we
thought
ourselves
warriors
and
grown
folk
swine
stupid
old
animals
who
never
understood
and
never
had
an
impulse
and
said
you
must
be
good
we
slank
like
stoats
and
fled
like
foxes
we
put
cigarettes
in
the
lighted
cigarettes
and
letters
all
aflame
o
the
surprise
when
the
postman
came
we
stole
eggs
and
apples
and
made
fine
hay
in
people
houses
when
people
were
away
we
broke
street
lamps
and
away
we
ran
then
i
was
a
boy
but
now
i
am
a
man
now
i
am
a
man
and
do
have
any
fun
i
hardly
ever
shout
and
i
never
never
run
and
i
do
care
if
he
dead
that
friend
of
mine
for
then
i
was
a
boy
and
now
i
am
a
swine
ii
we
met
again
the
other
night
with
people
you
were
quite
polite
shook
my
hand
and
spoke
a
while
of
common
things
with
cautious
smile
paid
the
usual
debt
men
owe
to
fellows
whom
they
used
to
know
but
when
our
eyes
met
full
yours
dropped
and
sudden
resolute
you
stopped
moving
with
hurried
syllables
to
make
remarks
to
someone
else
i
caught
them
not
to
me
they
said
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
things
were
very
different
then
boys
are
fools
and
men
are
men
several
times
the
other
night
you
did
your
best
to
be
polite
when
in
the
conversation
round
you
heard
my
tongue
familiar
sound
you
bent
in
eager
pose
my
way
to
hear
what
i
had
got
to
say
trying
you
thought
with
some
success
to
hide
the
chasm
nakedness
but
on
your
eyes
hard
films
there
lay
no
no
pretence
could
veil
your
blank
indifference
and
if
thoughts
came
recalling
things
from
those
old
springs
when
underneath
the
moon
and
sun
our
separate
pulses
beat
as
one
vagrant
tender
thoughts
that
asked
admittance
found
the
portal
masked
you
spurned
them
when
i
said
my
say
with
laugh
and
nod
you
turned
away
to
toss
your
friends
some
easy
jest
that
smote
my
brow
and
stabbed
my
breast
foolish
though
it
be
and
vain
i
am
not
master
of
my
pain
and
when
i
said
to
you
i
hoped
we
should
not
meet
again
and
wondered
how
the
soul
i
knew
could
change
so
much
have
i
changed
too
iii
there
was
a
man
whom
i
knew
well
whose
choice
it
was
to
live
in
hell
reason
there
was
why
that
was
so
but
what
it
was
i
do
not
know
he
had
a
room
high
in
a
tower
and
sat
there
drinking
hour
by
hour
drinking
drinking
all
alone
with
candles
and
a
wall
of
stone
now
and
then
he
sobered
down
and
stayed
a
night
with
me
in
town
if
he
found
me
with
a
crowd
he
shrank
and
did
not
speak
aloud
he
sat
in
a
corner
silently
and
others
of
the
company
would
note
his
curious
face
and
eye
his
twitching
face
and
timid
eye
when
they
saw
the
eye
he
had
they
thought
perhaps
that
he
was
mad
i
knew
he
was
clear
and
sane
but
had
a
horror
in
his
brain
he
had
much
money
and
one
friend
and
drank
quite
grimly
to
the
end
why
he
chose
to
die
in
hell
i
did
not
ask
he
did
not
tell
a
chant
gently
the
petals
fall
as
the
tree
gently
sways
that
has
known
many
springs
and
many
petals
fall
year
after
year
to
strew
the
green
deserted
ways
and
the
statue
and
the
pond
and
the
low
broken
wall
faded
is
the
memory
of
old
things
done
peace
floats
on
the
ruins
of
ancient
festival
they
lie
and
forget
in
the
warmth
of
the
sun
and
a
sky
arches
over
all
o
softly
o
tenderly
the
heart
now
stirs
with
desires
faint
and
formless
and
seeking
not
i
find
quiet
thoughts
that
flash
like
azure
kingfishers
across
the
luminous
tranquil
mirror
of
the
mind
the
three
hills
there
were
three
hills
that
stood
alone
with
woods
about
their
feet
they
dreamed
quiet
when
the
sun
shone
and
whispered
when
the
rain
beat
they
wore
all
three
their
coronals
till
men
with
houses
came
and
scored
their
heads
with
pits
and
walls
and
thought
the
hills
were
tame
red
and
white
when
day
shines
bright
they
hide
the
green
for
miles
where
are
the
old
hills
gone
at
night
the
moon
looks
down
and
smiles
she
sees
the
captors
small
and
weak
she
knows
the
prisoners
strong
she
hears
the
patient
hills
that
speak
brothers
it
is
not
long
brothers
we
stood
when
they
were
not
ten
thousand
summers
past
brothers
when
they
are
clean
forgot
we
shall
outlive
the
last
one
shall
die
and
one
shall
flee
with
terror
in
his
train
and
earth
shall
eat
the
stones
and
we
shall
be
alone
again
at
night
dark
foot
the
moony
sky
blue
moonlight
bars
the
drive
here
at
the
open
window
i
sit
smoking
and
alive
wind
in
the
branches
swells
and
breaks
like
ocean
on
a
beach
deep
in
the
sky
and
my
heart
there
wakes
a
thought
i
can
not
reach
lines
when
london
was
a
little
town
lean
by
the
river
marge
the
poet
paced
it
with
a
frown
he
thought
it
very
large
he
loved
bright
ship
and
pointing
steeple
and
bridge
with
houses
loaded
and
priests
and
people
but
ah
they
were
not
woaded
not
all
the
walls
could
shed
the
spell
of
meres
and
marshes
green
nor
any
chaffering
merchant
tell
the
beauty
that
had
been
the
crying
birds
at
fall
of
night
the
fisher
in
his
coracle
and
grim
on
ludgate
windy
height
an
and
an
oracle
sick
for
the
past
his
hair
he
rent
and
dropt
a
tear
in
season
if
he
had
cause
for
his
lament
we
have
much
better
reason
for
now
the
fields
and
paths
he
knew
are
coffined
all
with
bricks
the
lucid
silver
stream
he
knew
runs
slimy
as
the
styx
north
and
south
and
east
and
west
far
as
the
eye
can
travel
earth
with
a
sombre
web
is
drest
that
nothing
can
unravel
and
we
must
wear
as
black
a
frown
wail
with
as
keen
a
woe
that
london
was
a
little
town
five
hundred
years
ago
yet
even
this
place
of
steamy
stir
this
pit
of
belch
and
swallow
with
chrism
of
gold
and
gossamer
the
elements
can
hallow
i
have
a
room
in
chancery
lane
high
in
a
world
of
wires
whence
fall
the
roofs
a
ragged
plain
wooded
with
many
spires
there
in
the
dawns
of
summer
days
i
stand
and
there
behold
a
city
veiled
in
rainbow
haze
and
spangled
all
with
gold
the
breezes
waft
abroad
the
rays
shot
by
the
waking
sun
a
myriad
chimneys
softly
blaze
a
myriad
shadows
run
round
the
wide
rim
in
radiant
mist
the
gentle
suburbs
quiver
and
nearer
lies
the
shining
twist
of
thames
a
holy
river
left
and
right
my
vision
drifts
by
yonder
towers
i
linger
where
westminster
cathedral
lifts
its
belled
byzantine
finger
and
here
against
my
perch√®d
home
where
hold
wise
converse
daily
the
loftier
and
the
lesser
dome
st
paul
and
the
old
bailey
florian
song
my
soul
it
shall
not
take
us
o
we
will
escape
this
world
that
strives
to
break
us
and
cast
us
to
its
shape
its
chisel
shall
not
enter
its
fire
shall
not
touch
hard
from
rim
to
centre
we
will
not
crack
or
smutch
words
sweet
and
flowered
we
have
an
amulet
we
will
not
play
the
coward
for
any
black
threat
if
we
but
give
endurance
to
what
is
now
within
the
single
assurance
that
it
is
good
to
win
slaves
think
it
better
to
be
weak
than
strong
whose
hate
is
a
fetter
and
their
love
a
thong
but
we
will
view
those
others
with
eyes
like
stone
and
if
we
have
no
brothers
we
will
walk
alone
antinomies
on
a
railway
station
as
i
stand
waiting
in
the
rain
for
the
foggy
hoot
of
the
london
train
gazing
at
silent
wall
and
lamp
and
post
and
rail
and
platform
damp
what
is
this
power
that
comes
to
my
sight
that
i
see
a
night
without
the
night
that
i
see
them
clear
yet
look
them
through
the
silvery
things
and
the
darkly
blue
that
the
solid
wall
seems
soft
as
death
a
wavering
and
unanchored
wraith
and
rails
that
shine
and
stones
that
stream
unsubstantial
as
a
dream
what
sudden
door
has
opened
so
what
hand
has
passed
that
i
should
know
this
moving
vision
not
a
trance
that
melts
the
globe
of
circumstance
this
sight
that
marks
not
least
or
most
and
makes
a
stone
a
passing
ghost
is
it
that
a
year
ago
i
stood
upon
this
spot
is
it
that
since
a
year
ago
the
place
and
i
have
altered
not
is
it
that
i
half
forgot
a
year
ago
and
all
despised
for
a
space
the
things
that
i
had
prized
the
race
of
life
the
glittering
show
is
it
that
now
a
year
has
passed
in
vain
pursuit
of
glittering
things
in
fruitless
searching
shouting
running
and
greedy
lies
and
candour
cunning
here
as
i
stand
the
year
above
sudden
the
heats
and
the
strivings
fail
and
fall
away
a
fluctuant
veil
and
the
fixed
familiar
stones
restore
the
old
core
the
unmoving
and
essential
me
the
eternal
personality
alone
enduring
first
and
last
no
this
i
have
known
in
other
ways
in
other
places
other
days
not
only
here
on
this
one
peak
do
fixity
and
beauty
speak
of
the
delusiveness
of
change
of
the
transparency
of
form
the
bootless
stress
of
minds
that
range
the
awful
calm
behind
the
storm
in
many
places
many
days
the
invaded
soul
receives
the
rays
of
countries
she
was
nurtured
in
speaks
in
her
silent
language
strange
to
that
beyond
which
is
her
kin
even
in
peopled
streets
at
times
a
metaphysic
arm
is
thrust
through
the
partitioning
fabric
thin
and
tears
away
the
darkening
pall
cast
by
the
bright
phenomenal
and
clears
the
obscur√®d
spirit
mirror
from
shadows
of
deceptive
error
and
shows
the
bells
and
all
their
ringing
and
all
the
crowds
and
all
their
singing
carillons
that
are
nothing
chimes
and
dust
that
is
not
even
dust
but
rarely
hold
i
converse
thus
where
shapes
are
bright
and
clamorous
more
often
comes
the
word
divine
in
places
motionless
and
far
beneath
the
white
peculiar
shine
of
sunless
summer
afternoons
at
eventide
on
pale
lagoons
where
hangs
reflected
one
pale
star
or
deep
in
the
green
solitudes
of
still
erect
entranc√®d
woods
o
in
the
woods
alone
lying
scarce
a
bough
in
the
wind
sighing
gaze
i
long
with
fervid
power
at
leaf
and
branch
and
grass
and
flower
breathe
i
breaths
of
trembling
sight
shed
from
great
urns
of
green
delight
take
i
draughts
and
drink
them
up
poured
from
many
a
stalk
and
cup
now
do
i
burn
for
nothing
more
than
thus
to
gaze
thus
to
adore
this
exquisiteness
of
nature
ever
in
silence
but
with
instant
light
rends
the
film
with
joy
i
quiver
to
see
with
new
celestial
sight
flower
and
leaf
and
grass
and
tree
doomed
barks
on
an
eternal
sea
flit
as
transient
smoke
beauty
herself
her
spell
has
broke
beauty
the
herald
and
the
lure
her
message
told
may
not
endure
her
portal
opened
she
has
died
supreme
immortal
suicide
yes
sleepless
nature
soundless
flings
invisible
grapples
round
the
soul
drawing
her
through
the
web
of
things
to
the
primal
end
of
her
journeyings
her
ultimate
and
constant
pole
for
beauty
with
her
hands
that
beckon
is
but
the
prophet
of
a
higher
a
flaming
and
ephemeral
beacon
a
phoenix
perishing
by
fire
herself
from
us
herself
estranges
herself
her
mighty
tale
doth
kill
that
all
things
change
yet
nothing
changes
that
all
things
move
yet
all
are
still
i
can
not
sink
i
can
not
climb
now
that
i
see
my
ancient
dwelling
the
central
orb
untouched
of
time
and
taste
a
peace
all
bliss
excelling
now
i
have
broken
beauty
wall
now
that
my
kindred

i
hold
i
care
not
though
the
cities
fall
and
the
green
earth
go
cold
there
beyond
my
window
ledge
heaped
against
the
sky
a
hedge
of
huge
and
waving
stands
with
multitudes
of
fluttering
hands

they
beat

to
and
fro
never
stillness
may
they

plunged
by
the
wind
and
hurled
and
torn
anguished
purposeless
forlorn
o
ferocious
o

in
huddled
isolation
faring
through
a
scattered
universe
lost
coins
from
the
almighty
purse
no

you
do
not

the
firm
foundations
of
the

to
a

laugh
in
the
hammering

you
harry
the

who
could

should

be
trodden
down

swift
swift
you
fly
with
burning

to
place
your
beauty
shield
reversed
above
the
vile
defenceless
weak
epilogue
than
farthest

more
distant
a

more
a

more
a

cries
on
insistent
you
may
smile
more
if
you
will
you
may
sing
too
and
spring
too
but
numb
at
last
and
dumb
at
last
whatever
port
you
cling
to
you
must
come
at
last
to
a
hill
and
never
a
man
you
find
there
to
take
your
hand
and
shake
your
hand
but
when
you
go
behind
there
you
must
make
your
hand
a
sword
to
fence
with
a
foeman
swarthy
and
swink
there
nor
shrink
there
though
cowardly
and
worthy
must
drink
there
one
reward
dialogue
the
one
the
dead
man
gone
the
live
man
sad
the
dying
leaf
shakes
on
the
tree
the
wind
constrains
the
and
moans
like
moaning
of
the
sea
and
sour
the
taste
now
culled
in
haste
of
lovely
things
i
won
too
late
and
loud
and
loud
above
the
crowd
the
voice
of
one
more
strong
than
we
the
other
this
voice
you
hear
this
call
you
fear
is
it
unprophesied
or
new
were
you
so
insolent
to
think
its
rope
would
never
circle
you
did
you
then
beastlike
live
and
walk
with
ears
and
eyes
that
would
not
turn
who
bade
you
hope
your
service
in
that
eternal
retinue
the
one
no
for
i
swear
now
bare
the
tree
and
loud
the
moaning
of
the
wind
i
walked
no
rut
with
eyelids
shut
my
ears
and
eyes
were
never
blind
only
my
eager
thoughts
i
bent
on
many
things
that
i
desired
to
make
my
greedy
heart
content
ere
flesh
and
blood
i
left
behind
the
other
ignorance
then
was
all
your
fault
and
film√®d
eyes
that
could
not
know
that
half
discerned
and
never
learned
the
temporal
way
that
men
must
go
you
set
the
image
of
the
world
high
for
your
heart
idolatry
though
with
your
lips
you
called
the
world
a
toy
a
ghost
a
passing
show
the
one
no
no
this
is
not
true
my
lips
spoke
only
what
my
heart
believed
called
i
the
world
a
toy
i
spoke
not
or
but
that
i
thought
the
toy
was
mine
to
play
with
and
the
passing
show
would
sate
at
least
my
passing
lusts
and
did
not
therefore
am
i
grieved
what
did
i
do
that
i
must
bear
this
lifelong
tyranny
of
my
fate
that
i
must
writhe
in
bonds
unsought
of
accidental
love
and
hate
had
chance
but
joined
different
dice
but
once
or
twice
but
once
or
twice
all
lovely
things
that
i
desired
i
should
have
held
before
too
late
surely
i
knew
that
flesh
was
grass
nor
valued
overmuch
the
prize
but
all
the
powers
of
chance
conspired
to
cheat
a
man
both
just
and
wise
happy
i
been
had
i
but
had
my
due
reward
and
not
a
sword
flaming
in
diabolic
hand
between
me
and
my
paradise
the
other
no
hooded
band
of
fates
did
stand
your
heart
ambitions
to
gainsay
no
flaming
brand
in
evil
hand
was
ever
thrust
across
your
way
only
the
things
all
men
must
meet
the
common
attributes
of
men
that
men
may
flinch
to
see
or
seeing
deny
but
avoid
them
no
man
may
fall
the
dice
not
once
or
twice
but
always
to
make
the
sum
chance
what
may
a
life
a
life
and
to
a
single
goal
must
come
though
a
man
search
far
and
wide
never
is
hunger
satisfied
nature
brings
her
natural
fetters
man
is
meshed
and
the
wise
are
dumb
o
vain
all
art
to
assuage
a
heart
with
accents
of
a
mortal
tongue
all
earthly
words
are
incomplete
and
only
sweet
are
the
songs
unsung
never
yet
was
cause
for
regret
yet
regret
must
afflict
us
all
better
it
were
to
grasp
the
world
which
this
world
is
a
curtain
flung
starlight
last
night
i
lay
in
an
open
field
and
looked
at
the
stars
with
lips
sealed
no
noise
moved
the
windless
air
and
i
looked
at
the
stars
with
steady
stare
there
were
some
that
glittered
and
some
that
shone
with
a
soft
and
equal
glow
and
one
that
queened
it
over
the
sprinkled
round
swaying
the
host
with
silent
sound
calm
things
i
thought
in
your
cavern
blue
i
will
learn
and
hold
and
master
you
i
will
yoke
and
scorn
you
as
i
can
for
the
pride
of
my
heart
is
the
pride
of
a
man
grass
to
my
cheek
in
the
dewy
field
i
lay
quite
still
with
lips
sealed
and
the
pride
of
a
man
and
his
rigid
gaze
stalked
like
swords
on
heaven
ways
but
through
a
sudden
gate
there
stole
the
universe
and
spread
in
my
soul
quick
went
my
breath
and
quick
my
heart
and
i
looked
at
the
stars
with
lips
apart
song
there
is
a
wood
where
the
fairies
dance
all
night
long
in
a
ring
of
mushrooms
daintily
by
each
tree
bole
sits
a
squirrel
or
a
mole
and
the
moon
through
the
branches
darts
light
on
the
grass
their
slim
limbs
glance
their
shadows
in
the
moonlight
swing
in
quiet
unison
and
the
moon
discovers
that
they
all
have
lovers
but
they
never
break
their
hearts
they
never
grieve
at
all
for
sands
that
run
they
never
know
regret
for
a
deed
that
done
and
they
never
think
of
going
to
a
shed
with
a
gun
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
crepuscular
no
creature
stirs
in
the
wide
fields
the
rifted
western
heaven
yields
the
dying
sun
illumination
this
is
the
hour
of
tribulation
when
with
clear
sight
of
eve
engendered
day
homage
to
delusion
rendered
mute
at
her
window
sits
the
soul
clouds
and
skies
and
lakes
and
seas
valleys
and
hills
and
grass
and
trees
sun
moon
and
stars
all
stand
to
her
limbs
of
one
lordless
challenger
who
without
deigning
taunt
or
frown
throws
a
perennial
gauntlet
down
come
conquer
me
and
take
thy
toll
no
cowardice
or
fear
she
knows
but
as
once
more
she
girds
there
grows
an
unresign√®d
hopelessness
from
memory
of
former
stress
head
bent
she
muses
whilst
he
waits
how
with
such
weapons
dint
his
plates
how
quell
this
vast
and
sleepless
giant
calmly
immortally
defiant
how
fell
him
bind
him
and
control
with
a
silver
cord
and
a
golden
bowl
for
music
death
in
the
cold
grey
morning
came
to
the
man
where
he
lay
and
the
wind
shivered
and
the
tree
shuddered
and
the
dawn
was
grey
and
the
face
of
the
man
was
grey
in
the
dawn
and
the
watchers
by
the
bed
knew
as
they
heard
the
shaking
of
the
leaves
that
the
man
was
dead
the
fugitive
flying
his
hair
and
his
eyes
averse
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
how
could
our
song
his
charms
rehearse
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
high
on
a
down
we
found
him
last
shy
as
a
hare
he
fled
as
fast
how
could
we
clasp
him
or
ever
he
passed
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
how
could
we
cling
to
his
limbs
that
shone
ravish
his
cheeks
red
gonfalon
or
the
cloak
that
he
had
on
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
for
the
wind
of
his
feet
still
straightly
shaping
he
loosed
at
our
breasts
from
his
eyes
escaping
one
crooked
swift
glance
like
a
javelin
leaping
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
and
his
feet
passed
over
the
sunset
land
from
the
place
forlorn
where
a
forlorn
band
watching
him
flying
we
still
did
stand
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
vanishing
now
who
would
not
stay
to
the
blue
hills
on
the
verge
of
day
o
soft
soft
music
play
fading
away
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
fading
away
echoes
there
is
a
far
unfading
city
where
bright
immortal
people
are
remote
from
hollow
shame
and
pity
their
portals
frame
no
guiding
star
but
blightless
pleasure
moteless
rays
that
follow
their
footsteps
as
they
dance
long
lutanied
measures
through
a
maze
of
song
and
dalliance
there
always
glows
the
vernal
sun
there
happy
birds
for
ever
sing
there
faint
perfumed
breezes
run
through
branches
of
eternal
spring
there
faces
browned
and
fruit
and
milk
and
words
and
kisses
in
galleys
gowned
with
gold
and
silk
shake
on
a
lake
of
dainty
blisses
coyness
is
not
nor
bear
they
thought
save
of
a
shining
gracious
flow
all
natural
joys
are
temperate
sought
for
calm
desire
there
they
know
a
fire
promiscuous
languorous
kind
they
scorn
all
fiercer
lusts
and
quarrels
nor
blow
about
on
anger
wind
nor
burn
with
love
nor
rust
with
morals
folk
in
the
far
unfading
city
burning
with
lusts
my
senses
are
i
am
torn
with
love
and
shame
and
pity
be
to
my
heart
a
guiding
star
wise
youths
and
maidens
in
the
sun
with
eyes
that
charm
and
lips
that
sing
and
gentle
arms
that
rippling
run
shed
on
my
heart
your
endless
spring
the
mind
of
man
i
beneath
my
and
my
hair
covered
like
a
poisonous
well
there
is
a
land
if
you
looked
there
what
you
saw
you
quail
to
tell
you
that
sit
there
smiling
you
know
that
what
i
say
is
true
my
head
is
very
small
to
touch
i
feel
it
all
from
front
to
back
an
ear√®d
round
that
weighs
not
much
eyes
and
a
pulpy
crack
oh
how
small
how
small
it
is
how
could
countries
be
in
this
yet
when
i
watch
with
eyelids
shut
it
glimmers
forth
now
dark
now
clear
the
city
of
the
marshes
and
the
writhing
mere
the
land
that
every
man
i
see
knows
in
himself
but
not
in
me
ii
upon
the
borders
of
the
weald
i
walk
there
first
when
i
step
in
set
in
green
wood
and
smiling
field
the
city
stands
unstained
of
sin
white
thoughts
and
wishes
pure
walk
the
streets
with
steps
demure
in
its
clean
groves
and
spacious
halls
the
inhabitants
hold
innocent
sunny
festivals
and
mingle
in
decorous
dance
things
that
destroy
distort
deface
come
never
to
that
lovely
place
never
could
evil
enter
thither
it
could
not
live
in
that
sweet
air
the
shadow
of
an
ill
deed
must
wither
and
fall
away
to
nothing
there
you
would
say
as
there
you
stand
that
all
was
beauty
in
the
land
but
go
you
out
beyond
the
gateway
cleave
you
the
woods
and
pass
the
plain
cross
you
the
frontier
down
and
straightway
the
trees
will
end
the
grass
will
wane
and
you
will
come
to
a
wilderness
of
sticks
and
parch√®d
barrenness
the
middle
of
the
land
is
this
a
tawny
desert
midmost
set
barren
of
living
things
it
is
saving
at
night
some
vampires
flit
that
nest
them
in
the
farther
marish
where
all
save
vilest
things
must
perish
here
in
this
reedy
marsh
of
green
and
oily
pools
swarm
insects
fat
and
birds
of
prey
and
beasts
obscene
things
that
the
traveller
shudders
at
all
cunning
things
that
creep
and
fly
to
suck
men
blood
until
they
die
rarely
from
hence
does
aught
escape
into
the
world
of
outer
light
but
now
and
then
some
sable
shape
outward
will
dash
in
sudden
flight
and
men
stand
stonied
or
distraught
to
know
the
loathly
deed
or
thought
but
ah
beyond
the
marsh
you
reach
a
purulent
place
more
vile
than
all
a
festering
lake
too
foul
for
speech
rotten
and
black
with
coils
acrawl
where
writhe
with
lecherous
squeakings
shrill
horrors
that
make
the
heart
stand
still
there
a
heaven
diseased
it
lies
the
mere
alive
with
slimy
worms
with
perverse
terrible
infamies
and
murders
and
repulsive
forms
that
have
no
name
but
slide
here
deep
whilst
i
their
holder
silence
keep
a
reasonable
protestation
who
complained
of
his
vagueness
and
lack
of
dogmatic
not
i
suppose
since
i
deny
appearance
is
reality
and
doubt
the
substance
of
the
earth
does
your
remonstrance
come
to
birth
not
that
at
once
i
both
affirm
is
not
the
skin
that
makes
the
worm
and
every
tactile
thing
with
mass
must
find
its
symbol
in
the
grass
and
with
a
cool
conviction
say
even
a
critic
more
than
clay
and
every
dog
outlives
his
day
this
kind
of
vagueness
suits
your
view
you
would
not
carp
at
it
for
you
did
never
stand
with
those
who
take
their
pleasures
in
a
world
opaque
for
you
a
tree
would
never
be
lovely
were
it
but
a
tree
and
earthly
splendours
never
splendid
if
by
transience
unattended
your
eyes
are
on
a
farther
shore
than
any
of
earth
nor
do
adore
as
godhead
god
dead
hieroglyph
nor
would
you
be
perturbed
if
some
prophet
with
a
voice
of
thunder
and
avalanche
arm
should
blast
and
founder
the
logical
pillars
that
maintain
this
visible
world
which
loads
the
brain
loads
the
brain
and
withers
the
heart
and
holds
man
from
his
god
apart
but
still
with
you
remains
the
craving
for
some
more
solid
substance
having
surface
to
touch
colour
to
see
and
form
compact
in
symmetry
you
are
not
satisfied
with
these
vague
throbbings
nameless
ecstasies
nor
can
your
spirit
find
delight
in
an
amorphic
great
white
light
not
with
such
sickles
can
you
reap
if
a
dense
earth
you
can
not
keep
you
want
a
dense
heaven
as
substitute
with
trees
of
plump
celestial
fruit
red
apples
golden
pomegranates
and
a
river
flowing
by
tall
gates
of
topaz
and
of
chrysolite
and
walls
of
twenty
cubits
height
frank
you
cry
out
against
the
age
nor
you
nor
i
can
disengage
ourselves
from
that
in
which
we
live
nor
seize
on
things
god
does
not
give
thirsty
as
you
perhaps
i
long
for
courtyards
of
eternal
song
even
as
yours
my
feet
would
stray
in
a
city
where
is
always
day
and
a
green
spontaneous
leafy
garden
with
god
in
the
middle
for
a
warden
but
though
i
hope
with
strengthening
faith
to
taste
when
i
have
traversed
death
the
unimaginable
sweetness
of
certitude
of
such
concreteness
how
should
i
draw
the
hue
and
scope
of
substances
i
only
hope
or
blaze
upon
a
paper
screen
the
evidence
of
things
not
seen
this
art
of
ours
but
grows
and
stirs
experience
when
it
registers
and
you
know
well
as
i
know
well
this
autumn
of
time
in
which
we
dwell
is
not
an
age
of
revelations
solid
as
once
but
intimations
that
touch
us
with
warm
misty
fingers
leaving
a
nameless
sense
that
lingers
that
sight
is
blind
and
time
a
snare
and
earth
less
solid
than
the
air
and
deep
below
all
seeming
things
there
sits
a
steady
king
of
kings
a
radiant
ageless
permanence
a
quenchless
fount
of
virtue
whence
we
draw
our
life
a
sense
that
makes
a
staunch
conviction
nothing
shakes
of
our
own
immortality
and
though
being
man
with
certain
glee
i
eat
and
drink
though
i
suffer
pain
and
love
and
hate
and
love
again
well
or
in
mode
contemptible
thus
shackled
by
the
body
spell
i
see
through
pupils
of
the
beast
though
it
be
faint
and
blurred
with
mist
a
star
that
travels
in
the
east
i
see
what
i
can
not
what
i
will
in
things
that
move
things
that
are
still
thin
motion
even
cloudier
rest
i
see
the
symbols
god
hath
drest
the
moveless
trees
the
trees
that
wave
the
clouds
that
heavenly
highways
have
horses
that
run
rocks
that
are
fixt
streams
that
have
rest
and
motion
mixt
the
main
with
its
abiding
flux
the
wind
that
up
my
chimney
sucks
a
mounting
waterfall
of
flame
sticks
straws
dust
beetles
and
that
same
old
blazing
sun
the
psalmist
saw
a
testifier
to
the
law
divinely
to
the
heart
they
speak
saying
how
they
are
but
weak
wan
on
the
crystal
sea
but
stays
that
sea
still
dark
to
me
did
i
now
glibly
insolent
chart
the
ulterior
firmament
would
you
not
know
my
words
were
lies
where
not
my
testimonial
eyes
mortal
or
spiritual
lodge
mere
uncorroborated
fudge
praise
me
though
praise
i
do
not
want
rather
that
i
have
cast
much
cant
that
what
i
see
and
feel
i
write
read
what
i
can
in
this
dim
light
granted
to
me
in
nether
night
and
though
i
am
vague
and
shrink
to
guess
god
everlasting
purposes
and
never
save
in
perplext
dream
have
caught
the
least
gleam
of
the
great
kingdom
and
the
throne
in
the
world
that
lies
behind
our
own
i
have
not
lacked
my
certainties
i
have
not
haggard
moaned
the
skies
nor
waged
unnecessary
strife
nor
scorned
nor
overvalued
life
and
though
you
say
my
attitude
is
questioning
concede
my
mood
does
never
bring
to
tongue
or
pen
accents
of
gloomy
modern
men
who
wail
or
hail
the
death
of
god
and
weigh
and
measure
man
the
clod
or
say
they
draw
reluctant
breath
and
musically
mourn
that
death
is
a
queen
omnipotent
of
woe
and
life
her
lean
cicisbeo
abject
and
pale
whom
she
playeth
with
ere
she
shall
strike
and
pose
sad
riddles
to
the
sphinx
with
raven
quills
in
purple
inks
then
send
the
boy
to
fetch
more
drinks
in
the
park
this
dense
hard
ground
i
tread
these
iron
bars
that
ripple
past
will
they
unshaken
stand
when
i
am
dead
and
my
deep
thoughts
outlast
is
it
my
spirit
slips
falls
like
this
leaf
i
kick
aside
this
firmness
that
i
feel
about
my
lips
is
it
but
empty
pride
mute
knowledge
conquers
me
i
contemplate
them
as
they
are
faint
earth
and
shadowy
bars
that
shake
and
flee
less
hard
more
transient
far
than
those
unbodied
hues
the
sunset
flings
on
the
calm
river
and
as
i
look
a
swiftness
thrills
my
shoes
and
my
hands
with
empire
quiver
now
light
the
ground
i
tread
i
walk
not
now
but
rather
float
clear
but
unreal
is
the
scene
outspread
pitiful
thin
remote
poor
vapour
is
the
grass
so
frail
the
trees
and
railings
seem
that
did
i
sweep
my
hand
around
pass
through
them
as
in
a
dream
godlike
i
fear
no
changes
shatter
the
world
with
thunders
loud
still
would
i
flit
about
the
ranges
of
dark
and
ruddy
cloud
in
an
orchard
airy
and
quick
and
wise
in
the
shed
light
of
the
sun
you
clasp
with
friendly
eyes
the
thoughts
from
mine
that
run
but
something
breaks
the
link
i
solitary
stand
by
a
giant
gully
brink
in
some
vast
gloomy
land
sole
central
watcher
i
with
steadfast
sadness
now
in
that
waste
place
descry
the
awful
heavens
how
your
life
doth
dizzy
drop
a
little
foam
of
flame
from
a
peak
without
a
top
to
a
pit
without
a
name
the
ship
there
was
no
song
nor
shout
of
joy
nor
beam
of
moon
or
sun
when
she
came
back
from
the
voyage
long
ago
begun
but
twilight
on
the
waters
was
quiet
and
grey
and
she
glided
steady
steady
and
pensive
over
the
open
bay
her
sails
were
brown
and
ragged
and
her
crew
but
their
silent
lips
spoke
content
and
their
shoulders
pride
though
she
had
no
captives
on
her
deck
and
in
her
hold
there
were
no
heaps
of
corn
or
timber
or
silks
or
gold
ode
in
a
restaurant
in
this
dense
hall
of
green
and
gold
mirrors
and
lights
and
steam
there
sit
two
hundred
munching
men
while
several
score
of
others
flit
like
scurrying
beetles
over
a
fen
with
plates
in
fanlike
spread
or
fold
napkins
or
jerk
the
corks
from
bottles
ministers
to
greedy
throttles
some
make
noises
while
they
eat
pick
their
teeth
or
shuffle
their
feet
wipe
their
noses
eyes
that
range
or
frown
whilst
waiting
for
their
change
gobble
gobble
toil
and
trouble
soul
this
life
is
very
strange
and
circumstances
very
foul
attend
the
belly
stormy
howl
how
horrible
this
noise
this
air
how
thick
it
is
disgusting
i
feel
sick
loosely
i
prod
the
table
with
a
fork
my
mind
gapes
dizzies
ceases
to
work
the
weak
unsatisfied
strain
of
a
band
in
another
room
through
this
dull
complex
din
comes
winding
thin
and
sharp
the
mourning
of
the
violin
the
faint
stings
of
the
harp
the
sounds
pierce
in
and
die
again
like
threads
of
ink
dropped
into
a
glass
of
water
which
curl
and
relax
and
soften
and
pass
briefly
the
music
hovers
in
unstable
poise
then
melts
away
drowned
in
the
heavy
sea
of
noise
and
i
i
am
now
emasculate
all
my
forces
dissipate
conquered
by
matter
utterly
moving
not
willing
not
i
lie
like
a
man
whom
timbers
pin
when
the
roof
of
a
mine
falls
in
halt
as
a
cloud
condenses
i
press
my
mind
recover
dominion
of
my
senses
with
newly
flowing
blood
i
lift
and
now
float
over
the
restaurant
expanses
like
a
draggled
over
dreary
flats
of
mud
an
effort
ah
i
urge
and
push
and
now
with
greater
strength
i
flush
the
hall
is
full
of
my
pinions
rush
no
drooping
now
the
place
is
mine
beating
the
walls
with
shattering
wings
over
the
herd
my
spirit
swings
in
triumph
shouts
aha
you
swine
grovel
before
your
lord
divine
i
only
i
am
real
here
through
the
uncertain
firmament
still
bestial
in
their
dull
content
the
despicable
phantoms
leer
hogs
even
now
in
my
right
hand
i
hold
at
my
will
the
thunderbolts
measured
not
in
mortal
volts
would
crash
you
to
annihilation
lit
with
a
new
illumination
what
need
i
of
ears
and
eyes
of
flesh
imperious
i
will
rise
dominate
you
as
a
god
who
only
does
not
trouble
to
wield
the
rod
of
death
or
kick
your
weak
spheroid
like
a
football
through
the
void
ha
was
it
but
a
dream
and
did
it
merely
seem
ha
not
yet
free
of
your
cage
soul
spite
of
all
your
rage
come
now
this
foe
engage
with
explosion
of
your
might
oh
heave
oh
leap
and
flash
up
soul
like
a
stabbing
scream
in
the
night
hurl
aside
this
useless
bowl
of
a
body
but
there
comes
a
shock
a
soft
tremendous
shock
of
contact
with
the
body
i
lose
all
power
and
fall
back
back
like
a
solitary
rower
whose
prow
that
debonair
the
waves
did
ride
is
suddenly
hurled
back
by
an
iron
tide
o
sadness
sadness
feel
the
returning
pain
of
touch
with
unescapable
mortal
things
again
the
cloth
is
linen
the
floor
is
wood
my
plate
holds
cheese
my
tumbler
toddy
i
can
not
get
free
of
the
body
and
no
man
ever
could
self
do
not
lose
your
hold
on
life
nor
coward
seek
to
shrink
the
strife
of
body
and
spirit
even
now
not
for
the
first
time
even
now
clear
in
your
ears
has
rung
the
message
that
tense
abstraction
is
the
passage
to
nervelessness
and
living
death
never
forget
while
you
draw
breath
that
all
the
hammers
of
will
can
never
your
chain√®d
soul
from
matter
sever
and
though
it
be
confused
and
mixed
this
is
the
world
in
which
you
fixed
never
despise
the
things
that
are
set
your
teeth
upon
the
grit
though
your
heart
like
a
motor
beat
hold
fast
this
earthly
star
the
whole
of
it
the
whole
of
it
look
on
this
crowd
now
calm
now
look
remember
now
that
each
one
drew
woman
milk
which
you
partook
and
year
by
year
in
wonder
grew
scorn
not
them
nor
scorn
not
their
feasts
which
you
partake
nor
call
them
beasts
these
be
children
of
one
power
with
you
nor
higher
you
nor
lower
they
also
hear
the
harp
and
fiddle
and
sometimes
quail
before
the
riddle
they
also
have
hot
blood
quick
thought
and
try
to
do
the
things
they
ought
they
also
have
hearts
that
ache
when
stung
and
sigh
for
days
when
they
were
young
and
curse
their
wills
because
they
falter
and
know
that
they
will
never
alter
see
these
men
in
a
world
of
men
material
bodies
yes
what
then
these
coarse
trunks
that
here
you
see
judge
them
not
lest
judged
you
be
bow
not
to
the
moment
curse
nor
make
four
walls
a
universe
think
of
these
bodies
here
assembled
whence
they
have
come
where
they
have
trembled
with
the
strange
force
that
fills
us
all
men
and
beasts
both
great
and
small
here
within
this
fleeting
home
two
hundred
men
have
this
day
come
here
collected
for
one
day
each
shall
go
his
separate
way
self
you
can
imagine
nought
of
all
the
battles
they
have
fought
all
the
labours
they
have
done
all
the
journeys
they
have
run
o
they
have
come
from
all
the
world
borne
by
invisible
currents
swirled
like
leaves
into
this
vortex
here
flying
or
like
the
spirits
drear
windborne
and
frail
whom
dante
saw
who
yet
obeyed
some
hidden
law
is
it
not
miraculous
that
they
should
here
be
gathered
thus
all
to
be
spread
before
your
view
who
are
strange
to
them
as
they
to
you
soul
how
can
you
sustain
without
a
sob
the
lightest
thought
of
this
titanic
throb
of
earthly
life
that
swells
and
breaks
into
leaping
scattering
waves
of
fire
into
tameless
tempests
of
effort
and
storms
of
desire
that
eternally
makes
the
confused
glittering
armies
of
humankind
to
their
own
heroism
blind
swarm
over
the
earth
to
build
to
dig
and
to
till
to
mould
and
compel
land
and
sea
to
their
will
whence
we
are
here
eating
standing
here
as
on
a
high
hill
strain
my
imagination
strain
forth
to
embrace
the
energies
that
labour
for
this
place
this
place
this
instant
beyond
your
island
verge
listen
and
hear
the
roaring
impulsive
surge
the
clamour
of
voices
the
blasting
of
powder
the
clanging
of
steel
the
thunder
of
hammers
the
rattle
of
oars
for
this
one
meal
ten
thousand
indian
hamlets
stored
their
yields
manchurian
peasants
sweltered
in
their
fields
and
greeks
drove
carts
to
patras
and
lone
men
saw
burning
summer
come
and
go
again
and
huddled
from
the
winds
of
winter
on
the
fertile
deserts
of
saskatchewan
to
fabricate
these
things
have
been
marchings
and
slaughters
the
sun
has
toiled
and
the
moon
has
moved
the
waters
cities
have
laboured
and
crowded
plains
and
deep
in
the
earth
men
have
plunged
unafraid
with
ardour
to
wrench
the
worth
of
sweating
caverns
and
paths
have
been
hewn
through
forests
where
for
uncounted
years
nor
sun
nor
moon
have
penetrated
men
have
driven
straight
shining
rails
through
the
dense
bowels
of
mountains
and
climbed
their
frozen
tops
and
wrinkled
sailors
have
shouted
at
shouting
gales
in
the
huge
pacific
and
battled
around
the
horn
and
gasping
coasted
to
rio
and
turning
towards
the
morn
fought
over
the
wastes
to
spain
and
battered
and
worn
sailed
up
the
channel
and
on
into
the
nore
to
the
city
of
masts
and
the
smoky
familiar
shore
so
so
of
every
substance
you
see
around
might
a
tale
be
unwound
of
perils
passed
of
adventurous
journeys
made
in
man
undying
and
stupendous
crusade
this
flower
of
man
energies
trade
brought
hither
to
hand
and
lip
by
waggon
train
or
ship
each
atom
that
we
eat
stare
at
the
wine
stare
at
the
meat
the
mutton
which
these
platters
fills
grazed
upon
a
thousand
hills
this
bread
so
square
and
white
and
dry
once
was
corn
that
sang
to
the
sky
and
all
these
spruce
obedient
wines
flowed
from
the
vatted
fruit
of
vines
that
trailed
a
bright
maternal
host
the
warm
mediterranean
coast
or
spread
their
bacchic
mantle
on
that
iberian
helicon
where
the
slopes
of
portugal
crown
the
atlantic
eastern
wall
o
mighty
energy
flame
o
patient
toils
and
journeys
in
the
name
of
trade
no
journey
ever
was
the
same
as
another
nor
ever
came
again
one
task
and
each
man
face
is
an
mask
from
the
minutest
cell
to
the
lordliest
star
all
things
are
unique
though
all
of
their
kindred
are
and
though
all
things
exist
for
ever
all
life
is
change
and
the
oldest
passions
come
to
each
heart
in
a
garment
strange
though
life
be
as
brief
as
a
flower
and
the
body
but
dust
man
walks
the
earth
holding
both
body
and
spirit
in
trust
and
the
various
glories
of
sense
are
spread
for
his
delight
new
pageants
glow
in
the
sunset
new
stars
are
born
in
the
night
and
clouds
come
every
day
and
never
a
shape
recurs
and
the
grass
grows
every
year
yet
never
the
same
blade
stirs
another
spring
and
no
delving
man
breaks
again
the
clod
as
he
did
last
year
though
he
stand
once
more
where
last
year
he
trod
o
wonderful
procession
by
god
wonderful
in
unity
wonderful
in
diversity
contemplate
it
soul
and
see
how
the
material
universe
moves
and
strives
with
anguish
and
glee
i
was
born
for
that
reason
with
muscles
heart
and
eyes
to
watch
each
following
season
to
work
and
to
be
wise
not
body
and
mind
to
tether
to
unseen
things
alone
but
to
traverse
together
the
known
and
the
unknown
my
muscles
were
not
welded
to
waste
away
in
sleep
my
bones
were
never
builded
to
throw
upon
a
heap
man
worships
god
in
action
senses
and
reason
call
and
thought
is
putrefaction
if
thought
is
all
in
all
most
of
the
guests
are
gone
look
over
there
against
a
pillar
leans
with
absent
air
a
tall
dark
pallid
waiter
there
he
stands
limply
with
vacant
eyes
and
listless
hands
he
dreams
of
some
small
tyrolean
town
a
church
a
bridge
a
stream
that
rushes
down
a
frustrate
hankering
man
this
one
short
time
unconscious
he
into
my
gaze
did
climb
he
sinks
again
again
he
is
but
one
of
many
myriads
underneath
the
sun
now
faint
now
vivid
how
puzzling
is
it
all
for
now
again
in
spite
of
all
the
lights
the
chairs
the
diners
and
the
hall
lose
their
opacity
fool
exert
your
will
finish
your
whisky
up
and
pay
your
bill
faith
when
i
see
truth
do
i
seek
truth
only
that
i
may
things
denote
and
rich
by
striving
deck
my
youth
as
with
a
vain
unusual
coat
or
seek
i
truth
for
other
ends
that
she
in
other
hearts
may
stir
that
even
my
most
familiar
friends
may
turn
from
me
to
look
on
her
so
i
this
day
myself
was
asking
out
of
the
window
skies
were
blue
and
thames
was
in
the
sunlight
basking
my
thoughts
coiled
inwards
like
a
screw
i
watched
them
anxious
for
a
while
then
quietly
as
i
did
watch
spread
in
my
soul
a
sudden
smile
i
knew
that
no
firm
thing
they
catch
and
i
remembered
if
i
leapt
upon
the
bosom
of
the
wind
it
would
sustain
me
question
slept
i
felt
that
i
had
almost
sinned
a
fresh
morning
now
am
i
a
tin
whistle
through
which
god
blows
and
i
wish
to
god
i
were
a
trumpet
but
why
god
only
knows
interior
i
and
myself
swore
enmity
alack
myself
has
tied
my
hands
behind
my
back
yielding
i
know
there
no
excuse
in
them
i
was
accomplice
to
the
stratagem
on
a
friend
recently
dead
i
the
stream
goes
fast
when
this
that
is
the
present
is
the
past
be
as
all
the
other
pasts
have
been
a
failing
hill
a
daily
dimming
scene
a
far
strange
port
with
foreign
life
astir
the
ship
has
left
behind
the
voyager
will
never
return
to
no
nor
see
again
though
with
a
heart
full
of
longing
he
may
strain
back
to
project
himself
and
once
more
count
the
boats
the
whitened
walls
that
climbed
the
mount
mark
the
cathedral
roof
the
gathered
spires
the
vanes
the
windows
red
with
sunset
fires
the
gap
of
the
and
watch
again
the
coloured
groups
of
women
and
the
men
lounging
at
ease
along
the
low
stone
wall
that
fringed
the
harbour
and
there
beyond
it
all
high
pastures
morning
and
evening
scattered
with
small
specks
that
were
grazing
sheep
it
is
all
gone
it
is
all
blurred
that
once
so
brightly
shone
he
can
not
now
with
the
old
clearness
see
the
rust
upon
one
ringbolt
of
the
quay
ii
and
yesterday
is
dead
and
you
are
dead
your
duplicate
that
hovered
in
my
head
thins
like
blown
wreathing
smoke
your
features
grow
to
interrupted
outlines
and
all
will
go
unless
i
fight
dispersal
with
my
will
so
i
shall
do
it
but
too
conscious
still
that
when
we
walked
together
had
i
known
how
soon
your
journey
was
to
end
alone
i
should
not
now
that
you
have
gone
from
view
be
gathering
derelict
odds
and
ends
of
you
but
in
the
intense
lucidity
of
pain
your
likeness
would
have
burnt
into
my
brain
i
did
not
know
lovable
and
unique
as
volatile
as
a
bubble
and
as
weak
you
sat
with
me
and
my
eyes
registered
this
thing
and
that
and
sluggishly
i
heard
your
voice
remembering
here
and
there
a
word
iii
so
in
my
mind
there
not
much
left
of
you
and
that
disintegrates
but
while
a
few
patches
of
memory
mirror
still
are
bright
nor
your
reflected
image
there
has
quite
faded
and
slipped
away
it
will
be
well
to
search
for
each
surviving
syllable
of
voice
and
body
and
soul
and
some
i
find
right
to
my
hand
and
some
tangled
and
blind
among
the
obscure
weeds
that
fill
the
mind
a
pause
i
plunge
my
thought
hooked
resolute
claws
deep
in
the
turbid
past
like
drowned
things
in
the
jaws
of
your
features
to
the
verge
of
conscious
knowledge
one
by
one
emerge
can
i
not
make
these
scattered
things
unite
i
knit
my
brows
and
clench
my
eyelids
tight
and
focus
to
a
point
streams
of
dark
pinkish
light
convolve
and
now
spasmodically
there
flit
clear
pictures
of
you
as
you
used
to
sit
the
way
you
crossed
your
legs
stretched
in
your
chair
elbow
at
rest
and
tumbler
in
the
air
jesting
on
books
and
politics
and
worse
and
still
good
company
when
most
perverse
capricious
friend
here
in
this
room
not
long
before
the
end
here
in
this
very
room
six
months
ago
you
poised
your
foot
and
joked
and
chuckled
so
beyond
the
window
shook
the
bough
you
saw
books
pictures
as
i
see
them
now
the
sofa
then
was
blue
the
telephone
listened
upon
the
desk
and
softly
shone
even
as
now
the
in
the
grate
and
the
little
brass
pendulum
swung
a
seal
of
fate
stamping
the
minutes
and
the
curtains
on
window
and
door
just
moved
in
the
air
and
on
the
dark
boards
of
the
floor
these
same
rugs
were
lying
and
then
you
never
had
a
thought
of
dying
iv
you
are
not
here
and
all
the
things
in
the
room
watch
me
alone
in
the
gradual
growing
gloom
the
you
that
thought
and
felt
are
i
know
not
where
the
you
that
sat
and
drank
in
that
will
never
sit
there
again
for
months
you
have
lain
under
a
graveyard
green
in
some
place
abroad
where
i
never
been
perhaps
there
is
a
stone
over
you
or
only
the
wood
and
the
earth
and
the
grass
cover
you
but
it
does
much
matter
for
dead
and
decayed
you
lie
like
a
million
million
others
who
felt
they
would
never
die
like
alexander
and
helen
the
beautiful
and
the
last
collier
hanged
for
murdering
his
trull
all
done
with
and
buried
in
an
equal
bed
v
yes
you
are
dead
like
all
the
other
dead
you
are
not
here
but
i
am
here
alone
and
evening
falls
fusing
tree
water
and
stone
into
a
violet
cloth
and
the
frail
hisses
with
a
soft
sharpness
like
a
fall
of
mounded
grain
and
a
steamer
softly
puffing
along
the
river
passes
drawing
a
file
of
barges
and
silence
falls
again
and
a
bell
tones
and
the
evening
darkens
and
in
sparse
rank
the
greenish
lights
well
out
along
the
other
bank
i
have
no
force
left
now
the
sights
and
sounds
impinge
upon
me
unresisted
like
raindrops
on
the
mould
and
striving
not
against
my
melancholy
mood
limp
as
a
door
that
hangs
upon
one
failing
hinge
limp
with
slack
marrowless
arms
and
thighs
i
sit
and
brood
on
death
and
death
and
death
and
quiet
thin
and
cold
following
of
this
one
friend
the
hopeless
helpless
ghost
the
weak
appealing
wraiths
of
notable
men
of
old
who
died
pass
through
the
air
and
then
host
after
host
innumerable
overwhelming
without
form
rolling
across
the
sky
in
awful
silent
storm
the
myriads
of
the
undifferentiated
dead
whom
none
recorded
or
of
whom
the
record
faded
o
spectacle
appallingly
sublime
i
see
the
universe
one
long
disastrous
strife
and
in
the
staggering
abysses
of
backward
and
forward
time
death
chasing
hard
upon
the
heels
of
creating
life
and
i
i
see
myself
as
one
of
a
heap
of
stones
wetted
a
moment
to
life
as
the
flying
wave
goes
over
onward
and
never
returning
leaving
no
mark
behind
there
nothing
to
hope
for
blank
cessation
numbs
my
mind
and
i
feel
my
heart
thumping
gloomy
against
its
cover
my
heavy
belly
hanging
from
my
bones
vi
below
in
the
dark
street
there
is
a
tap
of
feet
i
rise
and
angrily
meditate
how
often
i
have
let
of
late
this
thought
of
death
come
over
me
how
often
i
will
sit
and
backward
trace
the
deathly
history
of
the
human
race
the
ripples
of
men
who
chattered
and
were
still
known
and
unknown
older
and
older
until
before
man
birth
i
fall
shivering
and
aghast
through
a
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
remotest
past
till
painfully
my
spirit
throws
her
giddiness
off
and
then
as
soon
as
i
recover
and
try
to
think
again
life
seems
like
death
and
all
my
body
grows
icily
cold
and
all
my
brain
cold
as
the
jagged
craters
of
the
moon
and
i
wonder
is
it
not
strange
that
i
who
thus
have
heard
eternity
black
laugh
and
felt
its
freezing
breath
should
sometimes
shut
it
out
from
memory
so
as
to
play
quite
prettily
with
death
and
turn
an
easy
epitaph
i
can
hear
a
voice
whispering
in
my
brain
why
this
is
the
old
futility
again
criminal
day
by
day
your
own
life
is
ebbing
swiftly
away
and
what
have
you
done
with
it
except
to
become
a
maudlin
hypocrite
yes
i
know
i
know
one
should
not
think
of
death
or
the
dead
overmuch
but
mind
made
so
that
at
certain
times
the
roads
of
thought
all
lead
to
death
and
false
reasoning
clouds
one
soul
as
a
window
with
breath
is
clouded
in
winter
air
and
all
the
faith
one
may
have
lies
useless
and
dead
as
a
body
in
the
grave
the
march
i
heard
a
voice
that
cried
make
way
for
those
who
died
and
all
the
coloured
crowd
like
ghosts
at
morning
fled
and
down
the
waiting
road
rank
after
rank
there
strode
in
mute
and
measured
march
a
hundred
thousand
dead
a
hundred
thousand
dead
with
firm
and
noiseless
tread
all
yet
solid
with
faces
grey
and
ghast
and
by
the
house
they
went
and
all
their
brows
were
bent
straight
forward
and
they
passed
and
passed
and
passed
and
passed
but
o
there
came
a
place
and
o
there
came
a
face
that
clenched
my
heart
to
see
it
and
sudden
turned
my
way
and
in
the
face
that
turned
i
saw
two
eyes
that
burned
eyes
and
they
had
things
to
say
like
desolate
stars
they
shone
one
moment
and
were
gone
and
i
sank
down
and
put
my
arms
across
my
head
and
felt
them
moving
past
nor
looked
to
see
the
last
in
steady
silent
march
our
hundred
thousand
dead
prologue
in
darkness
with
my
sleeping
beloved
huddled
tranquil
beside
me
why
do
i
lie
awake
listening
to
the
loud
clock
hurry
in
the
darkness
and
feeling
my
heart
fierce
ache
that
beats
one
response
to
the
brain
many
questionings
and
in
solitude
bears
the
weight
of
all
the
world
evil
and
misery
and
frustration
and
the
senseless
pressure
of
fate
is
it
season
of
ploughing
and
sowing
this
long
vigil
that
so
certainly
it
recurs
in
this
unsought
return
of
a
pain
that
was
ended
is
it
here
that
a
song
first
stirs
can
it
be
that
from
this
when
gone
from
memory
there
will
spring
of
a
sudden
some
time
like
a
silver
lily
breaking
from
black
deadly
waters
the
shape
of
a
rhyme
the
lily
of
malud
the
lily
of
malud
is
born
in
secret
mud
it
is
breathed
like
a
word
in
a
little
dark
ravine
where
no
bird
was
ever
heard
and
no
beast
was
ever
seen
and
the
leaves
are
never
stirred
by
the
panther
velvet
sheen
it
blooms
once
a
year
in
summer
moonlight
in
a
valley
of
dark
fear
full
of
pale
moonlight
it
blooms
once
a
year
and
dies
in
a
night
and
its
petals
disappear
with
the
dawn
first
light
and
when
that
night
has
come
black
maids
with
ecstatic
terror
dumb
steal
through
the
shades
to
watch
hour
by
hour
the
unfolding
of
the
flower
when
the
world
is
full
of
night
and
the
moon
reigns
alone
and
drowns
in
silver
light
the
known
and
the
unknown
when
each
hut
is
a
mound
half
blue
silver
and
half
black
and
casts
upon
the
ground
the
hard
shadow
of
its
back
when
the
winds
are
out
of
hearing
and
the
never
shake
when
the
grass
in
the
clearing
is
silent
but
awake
a
sky
all
the
village
is
asleep
and
the
babes
that
nightly
cry
dream
deep
from
the
doors
the
maidens
creep
tiptoe
over
dreaming
curs
soft
so
soft
that
not
one
stirs
and
stand
curved
and
like
bathers
by
a
river
looking
at
the
forest
wall
groups
of
slender
naked
girls
whose
black
bodies
shine
like
pearls
where
the
moonbeams
fall
they
have
waked
they
knew
not
why
at
a
summons
from
the
night
they
have
stolen
fearfully
from
the
dark
to
the
light
stepping
over
sleeping
men
who
have
moved
and
slept
again
and
they
know
not
why
they
go
to
the
forest
but
they
know
as
their
pass
to
the
shore
of
the
grass
and
the
forest
dreadful
brink
that
their
tender
spirits
shrink
they
would
flee
but
can
not
turn
for
their
eyelids
burn
with
frenzy
and
each
maid
ere
she
leaves
the
moonlit
space
if
she
sees
another
face
is
thrilled
and
afraid
now
like
little
phantom
fawns
they
thread
the
outer
lawns
where
the
boles
of
giant
trees
stand
about
in
twos
and
threes
till
the
forest
grows
more
dense
and
the
darkness
more
intense
and
they
only
sometimes
see
in
a
lone
a
dead
and
spongy
trunk
in
the
earth
or
the
roots
of
a
tree
with
fungus
grey
or
a
drift
of
muddy
leaves
or
a
banded
snake
that
heaves
and
the
towering
unseen
roof
grows
more
intricate
and
soon
it
is
featureless
and
proof
to
the
lost
forgotten
moon
but
they
could
not
look
above
as
with
feet
they
move
onwards
on
the
path
with
quick
and
desperate
breath
for
their
circling
fingers
dread
to
caress
some
slimy
head
or
to
touch
the
icy
shape
of
a
hunched
and
hairy
ape
and
at
every
step
they
fear
in
their
very
midst
to
hear
a
lion
rending
roar
or
a
tiger
snore
and
when
things
swish
or
fall
they
shiver
but
dare
not
call
o
what
is
it
leads
the
way
that
they
do
not
stray
what
unimagined
arm
keeps
their
bodies
from
harm
what
presence
concealed
lifts
their
little
feet
that
yield
over
dry
ground
and
wet
till
their
straining
eyes
are
met
with
a
thinning
of
the
darkness
and
the
foremost
faintly
cries
in
awed
surprise
and
they
one
by
one
emerge
from
the
gloom
to
the
verge
of
a
small
sunken
vale
full
of
moonlight
pale
and
they
hang
along
the
bank
clinging
to
the
branches
dank
a
shadowy
festoon
out
of
sight
of
the
moon
and
they
see
in
front
of
them
rising
from
the
mud
a
single
straight
stem
and
a
single
pallid
bud
in
that
little
lake
of
light
from
the
moon
calm
height
a
stem
a
ghostly
bud
on
the
mud
that
shimmers
like
a
pond
and
over
there
beyond
the
guardian
forest
high
menacing
and
strange
invades
the
empty
sky
with
its
wild
black
range
and
they
watch
hour
by
hour
that
small
lonely
flower
in
that
deep
forest
place
that
hunter
never
found
it
shines
without
sound
as
a
star
in
space
and
the
silence
all
around
that
solitary
place
is
like
silence
in
a
dream
till
a
sudden
flashing
gleam
down
their
dark
faces
flies
and
their
lips
fall
apart
and
their
glimmering
great
eyes
with
excitement
dart
and
their
fingers
clutching
the
branches
they
were
touching
shake
and
arouse
hissing
leaves
on
the
boughs
and
they
whisper
aswoon
did
it
move
in
the
moon
o
it
moved
as
it
grew
it
is
moving
opening
with
calm
and
gradual
will
and
their
bodies
where
they
cling
are
shadowed
and
still
and
with
marvel
they
mark
that
the
mud
now
is
dark
for
the
unfolding
flower
like
a
goddess
in
her
power
challenges
the
moon
with
a
light
of
her
own
that
lovelily
grows
as
the
petals
unclose
wider
more
wide
with
an
awful
inward
pride
till
the
heart
of
it
breaks
and
stilled
is
their
breath
for
the
radiance
it
makes
is
as
wonderful
as
death
the
morning
crimson
stain
tinges
their
ashen
brows
as
they
part
the
last
boughs
and
slowly
step
again
on
to
the
village
grass
and
chill
and
languid
pass
into
the
huts
to
sleep
brief
slumber
yet
so
deep
that
when
they
wake
to
day
darkness
and
splendour
seem
broken
and
far
away
a
faint
miraculous
dream
and
when
those
maidens
rise
they
are
as
they
ever
were
save
only
for
a
rare
shade
of
trouble
in
their
eyes
and
the
surly
men
as
they
sit
about
their
huts
making
drums
out
of
guts
grunting
gruffly
now
and
then
carving
sticks
of
ivory
stretching
shields
of
wrinkled
skin
smoothing
sinister
and
thin
squatting
gods
of
ebony
chip
and
grunt
and
do
not
see
but
each
mother
silently
longer
than
her
wont
stays
shut
in
the
dimness
of
her
hut
for
she
feels
a
brooding
cloud
of
memory
in
the
air
a
lingering
thing
there
that
makes
her
sit
bowed
with
hollow
shining
eyes
as
the
dies
and
stare
softly
at
the
ember
and
try
to
remember
something
sorrowful
and
far
something
sweet
and
vaguely
seen
like
an
early
evening
star
when
the
sky
is
pale
green
a
quiet
silver
tower
that
climbed
in
an
hour
or
a
ghost
like
a
flower
or
a
flower
like
a
queen
something
holy
in
the
past
that
came
and
did
not
last
but
she
knows
not
what
it
was
a
house
now
very
quietly
and
rather
mournfully
in
clouds
of
hyacinth
the
sun
retires
and
all
the
that
were
so
warm
to
him
keep
but
in
memory
their
borrowed
fires
and
i
the
traveller
break
still
unsatisfied
from
that
faint
exquisite
celestial
strand
and
turn
and
see
again
the
only
in
this
wide
wilderness
of
darkening
land
the
house
that
house
o
now
what
change
has
come
to
it
its
crude
fa√ßade
its
roof
of
slate
what
imperceptible
swift
hand
has
given
it
a
new
a
wonderful
a
queenly
state
no
hand
has
altered
it
that
parallelogram
so
inharmonious
so
ill
arranged
that
hard
blue
roof
in
shape
and
colour
what
it
was
no
it
is
not
that
any
line
has
changed
only
that
loneliness
is
now
accentuate
and
as
the
dusk
unveils
the
heaven
deep
cave
this
small
world
feebleness
fills
me
with
awe
again
and
all
man
energies
seem
very
brave
and
this
mean
edifice
which
some
dull
architect
built
for
an
ignorant
hind
takes
on
the
quality
of
that
magnificent
unshakable
dauntlessness
of
human
kind
darkness
and
stars
will
come
and
long
the
night
will
be
yet
imperturbable
that
house
will
rest
avoiding
gallantly
the
stars
chill
scrutiny
ignoring
secrets
in
the
midnight
breast
thunders
may
shudder
it
and
winds
demoniac
may
howl
their
menaces
and
hail
descend
yet
it
will
bear
with
them
serenely
steadfastly
not
even
scornfully
and
wait
the
end
and
all
a
universe
of
nameless
messengers
from
unknown
distances
may
whisper
fear
and
it
will
imitate
immortal
permanence
and
stare
and
stare
ahead
and
scarcely
hear
it
stood
there
yesterday
it
will
too
when
there
is
none
to
watch
no
alien
eyes
to
watch
its
ugliness
assume
a
majesty
from
this
great
solitude
of
evening
skies
so
lone
so
very
small
with
worlds
and
worlds
around
while
life
remains
to
it
prepared
to
outface
whatever
awful
unconjectured
mysteries
may
hide
and
wait
for
it
in
time
and
space
behind
the
lines
the
wind
of
evening
cried
along
the
darkening
trees
along
the
darkening
trees
heavy
with
ancient
pain
heavy
with
ancient
pain
from
faded
centuries
from
faded
centuries
o
foolish
thought
and
vain
o
foolish
thought
and
vain
to
think
the
wind
could
know
to
think
the
wind
could
know
the
griefs
of
men
who
died
the
griefs
of
men
who
died
and
mouldered
long
ago
and
mouldered
long
ago
the
wind
of
evening
cried
arab
song
when
her
eyes
sudden
challenge
first
halted
my
feet
on
the
path
i
stood
like
a
shivering
caught
fugitive
and
strained
at
my
breath
and
the
truth
in
her
eyes
was
the
portent
of
love
and
of
death
for
i
am
of
the
tribe
of
ben
asra
who
die
when
they
love
o
you
who
have
faded
because
girls
were
contemptuous
and
cold
i
pitied
you
but
mine
i
have
won
and
her
breast
i
enfold
despairing
and
in
agony
long
for
the
thing
that
i
hold
for
i
am
of
the
tribe
of
ben
asra
who
die
when
they
love
she
is
fair
and
her
eyes
in
her
hair
are
like
stars
in
a
stream
she
is
kind
never
vaporous
maid
in
a
dream
leaning
over
my
pillow
more
tender
did
seem
but
her
beauty
and
sweetness
are
as
blasts
from
the
sands
of
the
south
drink
me
palsy
me
flay
me
bleed
my
veins
chain
my
limbs
choke
my
mouth
and
make
salt
to
my
lips
the
wine
that
should
temper
my
drouth
for
i
am
of
the
tribe
of
ben
asra
who
die
when
they
love
death
must
come
it
were
best
by
a
knife
in
her
hand
or
my
own
she
not
strike
and
i
dare
not
but
here
as
i
wander
alone
should
the
wood
topple
over
at
a
beast
flying
out
like
a
stone
i
shall
smile
in
its
face
at
her
image
bending
down
from
the
sky
and
its
teeth
in
my
neck
will
be
hers
and
its
snarls
as
i
die
will
be
gentle
and
sweet
to
my
ears
as
the
voice
of
the
dove
for
i
am
of
the
tribe
of
ben
asra
who
die
when
they
love
the
stronghold
quieter
than
any
twilight
shed
over
earth
last
deserts
quiet
and
vast
and
shadowless
is
that
unfounded
keep
higher
than
the
roof
of
the
night
high
chamber
deep
as
the
shaft
of
sleep
and
solitude
will
not
cry
there
melancholy
will
not
brood
there
hatred
with
its
sharp
corroding
pain
and
fear
will
not
come
there
at
all
never
will
a
tear
or
a
enter
over
that
enchanted
wall
but
o
if
you
find
that
castle
draw
back
your
foot
from
the
gateway
let
not
its
peace
invite
you
let
not
its
offerings
tempt
you
for
faded
and
decayed
like
a
garment
love
to
a
dust
will
have
fallen
and
song
and
laughter
will
have
gone
with
sorrow
and
hope
will
have
gone
with
pain
and
of
all
the
throbbing
heart
high
courage
nothing
will
remain
to
a
capt
acting
major
killed
we
see
willy
any
more
mamie
he
wo
be
coming
any
more
he
came
back
once
and
again
and
again
but
he
wo
get
leave
any
more
we
looked
from
the
window
and
there
was
his
cab
and
we
ran
downstairs
like
a
streak
and
he
said
hullo
you
bad
dog
and
you
crouched
to
the
floor
paralysed
to
hear
him
speak
and
then
let
fly
at
his
face
and
his
chest
till
i
had
to
hold
you
down
while
he
took
off
his
cap
and
his
gloves
and
his
coat
and
his
bag
and
his
thonged
sam
browne
we
went
upstairs
to
the
studio
the
three
of
us
just
as
of
old
and
you
lay
down
and
i
sat
and
talked
to
him
as
round
the
room
he
strolled
here
in
the
room
where
years
ago
before
the
old
life
stopped
he
worked
all
day
with
his
slippers
and
his
pipe
he
would
pick
up
the
threads
he
dropped
fondling
all
the
drawings
he
had
left
behind
glad
to
find
them
all
still
the
same
and
opening
the
cupboards
to
look
at
his
belongings
every
time
he
came
but
now
i
know
what
a
dog
does
know
though
you
thrust
your
head
on
my
knee
and
try
to
draw
me
from
the
that
you
find
so
dull
in
me
and
all
your
life
you
will
never
know
what
i
would
tell
you
even
if
i
could
that
the
last
time
we
waved
him
away
willy
went
for
good
but
sometimes
as
you
lie
on
the
hearthrug
sleeping
in
the
warmth
of
the
stove
even
through
your
muddled
old
canine
brain
shapes
from
the
past
may
rove
you
scarcely
remember
even
in
a
dream
how
we
brought
home
a
silly
little
pup
with
a
big
square
head
and
little
crooked
legs
that
could
scarcely
bear
him
up
but
your
tail
will
tap
at
the
memory
of
a
man
whose
friend
you
were
who
was
always
kind
though
he
called
you
a
naughty
dog
when
he
found
you
on
his
chair
who
make
you
face
a
reproving
finger
and
solemnly
lecture
you
till
your
head
hung
downwards
and
you
looked
very
sheepish
and
you
dream
of
your
triumphs
too
of
summer
evening
chases
in
the
garden
when
you
dodged
us
all
about
with
a
bone
we
were
three
boys
and
you
were
the
cleverest
but
now
we
two
alone
when
summer
comes
again
and
the
long
sunsets
fade
we
shall
have
to
go
on
playing
the
feeble
game
for
two
that
since
the
war
we
played
and
though
you
run
expectant
as
you
always
do
to
the
uniforms
we
meet
you
never
find
willy
among
all
the
soldiers
in
even
the
longest
street
nor
in
any
crowd
yet
strange
and
bitter
thought
even
now
were
the
old
words
said
if
i
tried
the
old
trick
and
said
where
willy
you
would
quiver
and
lift
your
head
and
your
brown
eyes
would
look
to
ask
if
i
were
serious
and
wait
for
the
word
to
spring
sleep
undisturbed
i
say
that
again
you
innocent
old
thing
i
must
sit
not
speaking
on
the
sofa
while
you
lie
asleep
on
the
floor
for
he
suffered
a
thing
that
dogs
could
dream
of
and
he
wo
be
coming
here
any
more
the
lake
i
am
a
lake
altered
by
every
wind
the
mild
south
breathes
upon
me
and
i
spread
a
dance
of
merry
ripples
in
the
sun
the
west
comes
stormily
and
i
am
troubled
my
waves
conflict
and
black
depths
show
between
them
under
the
east
wind
bitter
i
grow
and
chill
desolate
hopeless
but
when
blows
a
steady
wind
from
the
north
my
motion
ceases
i
am
frozen
smooth
and
hard
my
conquered
surface
returns
the
skies
cold
light
without
a
comment
i
make
no
sound
nor
can
i
nor
can
i
show
what
depth
i
have
if
any
depth
below
paradise
lost
what
hues
the
sunlight
had
how
rich
the
shadows
were
the
blue
and
tangled
shadows
dropped
from
the
crusted
branches
of
the
warped
upon
the
orchard
grass
how
heavenly
pure
the
blue
of
two
smooth
eggs
that
lay
light
on
the
rounded
mud
that
lined
the
thrush
nest
and
what
a
deep
delight
the
spots
that
speckled
them
and
that
small
tinkling
stream
that
ran
from
hedge
to
hedge
shadowed
over
by
the
trees
and
glinting
in
the
sunbeams
how
clear
the
water
was
how
flat
the
beds
of
sand
with
travelling
bubbles
mirrored
each
one
a
golden
world
to
my
enchanted
eyes
then
earth
was
new
to
me
but
now
i
walk
this
earth
as
it
were
a
lumber
room
and
sometimes
live
a
week
seeing
nothing
but
mere
herbs
mere
stones
mere
passing
birds
nor
look
at
anything
long
enough
to
feel
its
conscious
calm
assault
the
strength
of
it
the
word
the
royal
heart
of
it
childhood
will
not
return
but
have
i
not
the
will
to
strain
my
turbid
mind
that
soils
all
outer
things
and
open
again
to
all
the
miracles
of
light
to
see
the
world
with
the
eyes
of
a
blind
man
gaining
sight
acacia
tree
all
the
trees
and
bushes
of
the
garden
display
their
bright
new
green
but
above
them
all
still
bare
the
great
old
acacia
stands
his
solitary
bent
black
branches
stark
against
the
garden
and
the
sky
it
is
as
though
those
other
thoughtless
shrubs
the
winter
over
hastened
to
rejoice
and
clothe
themselves
in
spring
new
finery
heedless
of
all
the
iron
time
behind
them
but
he
older
and
wiser
stronger
and
sadder
of
heart
remembers
still
the
cruel
winter
and
knows
that
in
some
months
that
death
will
come
again
and
for
a
season
lonelily
meditates
above
his
lighter
companions
frivolity
till
some
late
sunny
day
when
breaking
thought
he
suddenly
yield
to
the
fickle
persuasive
sun
and
over
all
his
rough
and
writhing
boughs
and
tiniest
twigs
will
spread
a
pale
green
mist
of
feathery
leaf
more
delicate
more
touching
than
all
the
verdure
of
the
younger
slenderer
gracefuller
plants
around
and
then
when
the
leaves
have
grown
till
the
boughs
can
scarcely
be
seen
through
their
crowded
plumes
there
will
softly
glimmer
scattered
upon
him
blooms
in
the
green
weightlessly
hanging
august
moon
in
the
smooth
grey
heaven
is
poised
the
pale
half
moon
and
sheds
on
the
wide
grey
river
a
broken
reflection
out
from
the
low
the
boats
are
moored
after
the
heat
of
the
day
and
await
the
dark
and
here
where
the
side
of
the
road
shelves
into
the
river
at
the
gap
where
barges
load
and
horses
drink
there
are
no
horses
and
the
river
is
full
and
the
water
stands
by
the
shore
and
does
not
lap
and
a
barge
lies
up
for
the
night
this
side
of
the
island
the
bargeman
sits
in
the
bows
and
smokes
his
pipe
and
his
wife
by
the
cabin
stirs
behind
me
voices
pass
calm
sky
calm
river
and
a
few
calm
things
reflected
and
all
as
yet
keep
their
colours
the
island
osiers
the
spots
of
umbelliferous
flowers
and
the
yellow
clay
of
its
bank
the
barge
brown
sails
that
are
furled
up
the
mast
and
then
make
a
lean
triangle
to
the
end
of
the
hoisted
boom
and
the
high
dark
slips
where
they
used
to
build
vessels
and
now
build
them
no
more
all
in
the
river
reflected
in
quiet
colours
beyond
the
river
sweeps
round
in
a
bend
and
is
vast
a
wide
grey
level
under
the
motionless
sky
and
the
waxing
moon
clean
cut
in
the
sky
silence
time
is
suspended
that
the
light
fails
one
would
not
know
were
it
not
for
the
moon
in
the
sky
and
the
broken
moon
in
the
water
whose
fractures
tell
of
slow
broad
ripples
that
otherwise
do
not
show
maturing
imperceptibly
from
a
pale
to
a
deeper
gold
a
golden
half
moon
in
the
sky
and
broken
gold
in
the
water
in
the
water
tranquilly
severing
joining
gold
three
or
four
little
plates
of
gold
on
the
river
a
little
motion
of
gold
between
the
dark
images
of
two
tall
posts
that
stand
in
the
grey
water
there
are
voices
passing
a
murmur
of
quiet
voices
a
woman
laugh
and
children
going
home
a
whispering
couple
leaning
over
the
railings
and
somewhere
a
little
splash
as
a
dog
goes
in
i
have
always
known
all
this
it
has
always
been
there
is
no
change
anywhere
nothing
will
ever
change
i
heard
a
story
a
crazy
and
tiresome
myth
listen
behind
the
twilight
a
deep
low
sound
like
the
constant
shutting
of
very
distant
doors
doors
that
are
letting
people
over
there
out
to
some
other
place
beyond
the
end
of
the
sky
sonnet
there
was
an
indian
who
had
known
no
change
who
strayed
content
along
a
sunlit
beach
gathering
shells
he
heard
a
sudden
strange
commingled
noise
looked
up
and
gasped
for
speech
for
in
the
bay
where
nothing
was
before
moved
on
the
sea
by
magic
huge
canoes
with
bellying
cloths
on
poles
and
not
one
oar
and
fluttering
coloured
signs
and
clambering
crews
and
he
in
fear
this
naked
man
alone
his
fallen
hands
forgetting
all
their
shells
his
lips
gone
pale
knelt
low
behind
a
stone
and
stared
and
saw
and
did
not
understand
columbus
caravels
slant
to
the
shore
and
all
their
seamen
land
song
eyes
like
flowers
and
falling
hair
seldom
seen
nor
ever
long
then
i
did
not
know
you
were
destined
subject
for
a
song
sharing
your
unconsciousness
of
your
double
loveliness
unaware
how
fair
you
were
peaceful
eyes
and
shadowy
hair
only
now
your
beauty
falls
sweetly
on
some
other
place
lonely
reverie
recalls
more
than
anything
your
face
any
idle
hour
may
find
stealing
on
my
captured
mind
faintly
merging
from
the
air
eyes
like
flowers
and
falling
hair
a
generation
there
was
a
time
that
gone
and
will
not
come
again
we
knew
it
was
a
pleasant
time
how
good
we
never
dreamed
when
for
a
whimsy
sake
we
even
play
with
pain
for
everything
awaited
us
and
life
immortal
seemed
it
seemed
unending
then
to
eyes
no
thought
of
what
postponement
meant
hung
dark
across
our
mirth
we
had
years
and
strength
enough
for
any
enterprise
our
numerous
companionship
were
heirs
to
all
the
earth
but
now
all
memory
is
one
ironic
truth
we
look
like
strangers
at
the
boys
we
were
so
long
ago
for
half
of
us
are
dead
and
half
have
lost
their
youth
and
our
hearts
are
scarred
by
many
griefs
that
only
age
should
know
under
in
this
house
she
said
in
this
high
second
storey
in
this
room
where
we
sit
above
the
midnight
street
there
runs
a
rivulet
narrow
but
very
rapid
under
the
still
floor
and
your
unconscious
feet
the
lamp
on
the
table
made
a
cone
of
light
that
spread
to
the
base
of
the
walls
above
was
in
gloom
i
heard
her
words
with
surprise
had
i
worked
here
so
long
and
never
divined
that
secret
of
the
room
but
how
i
asked
does
the
water
climb
so
high
i
do
not
know
she
said
but
the
thing
is
there
pull
up
the
boards
while
i
go
and
fetch
you
a
rod
she
passed
and
i
heard
her
creaking
descend
the
stair
and
i
rose
and
rolled
the
turkey
carpet
back
from
the
two
broad
boards
by
the
north
wall
she
had
named
and
hearing
already
the
crumple
of
water
i
knelt
and
lifted
the
first
of
them
up
and
the
water
gleamed
bordered
with
little
frosted
heaps
of
ice
and
as
she
came
back
with
a
rod
and
line
that
swung
i
moved
the
other
board
in
the
yellow
light
the
water
trickled
frostily
slackly
along
i
took
the
tackle
a
stiff
black
rubber
worm
that
stuck
out
its
pointed
tail
from
a
cumbrous
hook
but
there
ca
be
fishing
in
water
like
this
i
said
and
she
with
weariness
there
is
no
ice
there
look
and
i
stood
there
gazing
down
at
a
stream
in
spate
holding
the
rod
in
my
undecided
hand
till
it
all
in
a
moment
grew
smooth
and
still
and
clear
and
along
its
deep
bottom
of
slaty
grey
sand
three
scattered
little
trout
as
black
as
tadpoles
came
waggling
slowly
along
the
lake
and
i
swung
my
arm
to
drop
my
pointing
worm
in
and
then
i
stopped
again
with
a
little
shake
for
i
heard
the
thin
voices
of
the
trout
my
body
felt
woolly
and
sick
and
astray
and
cold
crying
with
mockery
in
them
you
are
not
allowed
to
take
us
you
know
under
ten
years
old
and
the
room
swam
the
calm
woman
and
the
yellow
lamp
the
table
and
the
walls
and
the
floor
and
the
stream
sank
away
and
all
whirled
dizzily
and
i
moaned
and
the
pain
at
my
heart
grew
more
and
more
and
i
fainted
away
utterly
miserable
falling
in
a
place
where
there
was
nothing
to
pass
knowing
all
sorrows
and
the
mothers
and
sisters
of
sorrows
and
the
pain
of
the
darkness
before
anything
ever
was
rivers
rivers
i
have
seen
which
were
beautiful
slow
rivers
winding
in
the
flat
fens
with
bands
of
reeds
like
thronged
green
swords
guarding
the
mirrored
sky
and
streams
from
the
chalk
hills
to
valleys
of
meadows
and
and
bridges
whereunder
dark
shadows
trout
flit
or
lie
i
know
those
rivers
that
peacefully
glide
past
old
towers
and
shaven
gardens
where
mottled
walls
rise
from
the
water
and
mills
all
streaked
with
flour
and
rivers
with
wharves
and
rusty
shipping
that
flow
with
a
stately
tidal
motion
towards
their
destined
estuaries
full
of
the
pride
of
power
noble
great
rivers
thames
and
severn
tweed
with
his
gateway
of
many
grey
arches
clyde
dying
at
sunset
westward
in
a
sea
as
red
as
blood
rhine
and
his
hills
in
close
procession
placid
elbe
seine
slaty
and
swirling
and
isar
son
of
the
alpine
snows
a
furious
turquoise
flood
all
these
i
have
known
and
with
slow
eyes
i
have
walked
on
their
shores
and
watched
them
and
softened
to
their
beauty
and
loved
them
wherever
my
feet
have
been
and
a
hundred
others
also
whose
names
long
since
grew
into
me
that
dreaming
in
light
or
darkness
i
have
seen
though
i
have
not
seen
those
rivers
of
thought
cold
ebro
and
blue
racing
guadiana
passing
white
houses
that
ache
in
a
land
congo
and
nile
and
colorado
niger
indus
zambesi
and
the
yellow
river
and
the
oxus
and
the
river
that
dies
in
sand
what
splendours
are
theirs
what
continents
what
tribes
of
men
what
basking
plains
forests
and
deserts
marshes
ravines
and
falls
all
hues
and
shapes
and
tempers
wandering
they
take
as
they
wander
from
those
far
springs
that
endlessly
the
far
sea
calls
o
in
reverie
i
know
the
volga
that
turns
his
back
upon
europe
and
the
two
great
cities
on
his
banks
novgorod
and
astrakhan
where
the
world
is
a
few
soft
colours
and
under
the
evening
the
boatmen
chant
ancient
songs
the
tenderest
known
to
man
and
the
holy
river
ganges
his
fretted
cities
veiled
in
moonlight
arches
and
buttresses
in
the
high
moon
and
palms
grouped
in
the
moonlight
and
fanes
girdled
with
cypresses
their
domes
of
marble
softly
shining
to
the
high
silver
moon
and
that
aged
brahmapootra
who
beyond
the
white
himalayas
passes
many
a
lamassery
on
rocks
forlorn
and
frore
a
block
of
gaunt
grey
stone
walls
with
rows
of
little
barred
windows
where
shrivelled
young
monks
in
yellow
silk
are
hidden
for
evermore
but
o
that
great
river
the
amazon
i
have
sailed
up
its
gulf
with
eyelids
closed
and
the
yellow
waters
tumbled
round
and
all
was
rimmed
with
sky
till
the
banks
drew
in
and
the
trees
heads
and
the
lines
of
green
grew
higher
and
i
breathed
deep
and
there
above
me
the
forest
wall
stood
high
those
forest
walls
of
the
amazon
are
level
under
the
blazing
blue
and
yield
no
sound
save
the
whistles
and
shrieks
of
the
swarming
bright
macaws
and
under
their
lowest
drooping
boughs
torpidly
bubble
and
the
water
drifts
and
logs
in
the
water
drift
and
twist
and
pause
and
everywhere
tacitly
joining
float
noiseless
tributaries
tall
avenues
paved
with
water
and
as
i
silent
fly
the
vegetation
like
a
painted
scene
spars
and
spikes
and
monstrous
fans
and
ferns
from
hairy
sheaths
evenly
passes
by
and
stealthier
stagnant
channels
under
low
niches
of
drooping
leaves
coil
into
deep
recesses
and
there
have
i
entered
there
to
heavy
hot
dense
dim
places
where
creepers
climb
and
sweat
and
climb
and
the
drip
and
splash
of
oozing
water
loads
the
stifling
air
rotting
scrofulous
steaming
trunks
great
horned
emerald
beetles
crawling
ants
and
huge
slow
butterflies
that
had
strayed
and
lost
the
sun
ah
sick
i
have
swooned
as
the
air
thickened
to
a
pallid
brown
ecliptic
glow
and
on
the
forest
fallen
with
languor
thunder
has
begun
thunder
in
the
dun
dusk
thunder
rolling
and
battering
and
cracking
the
caverns
shudder
with
a
terrible
glare
again
and
again
and
again
till
the
land
bows
in
the
darkness
utterly
lost
and
defenceless
smitten
and
blinded
and
overwhelmed
by
the
crashing
rods
of
rain
and
then
in
the
forests
of
the
amazon
when
the
rain
has
ended
and
silence
come
what
dark
luxuriance
unfolds
from
behind
the
night
drawn
bars
the
wreathing
odours
of
a
thousand
trees
and
the
flowers
faint
gleaming
presences
and
over
the
clearings
and
the
still
waters
soft
indigo
and
hanging
stars
o
many
and
many
are
rivers
and
beautiful
are
all
rivers
and
lovely
is
water
everywhere
that
leaps
or
glides
or
stays
yet
by
starlight
moonlight
or
sunlight
long
long
though
they
look
these
wandering
eyes
even
on
the
fairest
waters
of
dream
never
untroubled
gaze
for
whatever
stream
i
stand
by
and
whatever
river
i
dream
of
there
is
something
still
in
the
back
of
my
mind
from
very
far
away
there
is
something
i
saw
and
see
not
a
country
full
of
rivers
that
stirs
in
my
heart
and
speaks
to
me
more
sure
more
dear
than
they
and
always
i
ask
and
wonder
though
often
i
do
not
know
it
why
does
this
water
not
smell
like
water
where
is
the
moss
that
grew
wet
and
dry
on
the
slabs
of
granite
and
the
round
stones
in
clear
brown
water
and
a
pale
film
rises
before
them
of
the
rivers
that
first
i
knew
though
famous
are
the
rivers
of
the
great
world
though
my
heart
from
those
alien
waters
drinks
delight
however
pure
from
their
loveliness
and
awe
however
deep
would
i
wish
for
a
moment
the
miracle
that
those
waters
should
come
to
chagford
or
gather
and
swell
in
tavy
cleave
where
the
stones
cling
to
the
steep
no
even
were
they
ganges
and
amazon
in
all
their
great
might
and
majesty
league
upon
league
of
wonders
i
would
lose
them
all
and
more
for
a
light
chiming
of
small
bells
a
twisting
flash
in
the
granite
the
tiny
thread
of
a
pixie
waterfall
that
lives
by
vixen
tor
those
rivers
in
that
lost
country
they
were
brown
as
a
clear
brown
bead
is
or
red
with
the
earth
that
rain
washed
down
or
white
with
and
some
tossed
foaming
over
boulders
and
some
curved
mild
and
tranquil
in
wooded
vales
securely
set
under
the
fond
warm
day
okement
and
erme
and
avon
exe
and
his
ruffled
shallows
i
could
cry
as
i
think
of
those
rivers
that
knew
my
morning
dreams
the
weir
by
tavistock
at
evening
when
the
circling
woods
were
purple
and
the
lowman
in
spring
with
the
and
the
little
moorland
streams
for
many
a
hillside
streamlet
there
falls
with
a
broken
tinkle
falling
and
dying
falling
and
dying
in
little
cascades
and
pools
where
the
world
is
furze
and
heather
and
flashing
plovers
and
fixed
larks
and
an
empty
sky
whitish
blue
that
small
world
rules
there
there
where
the
high
waste
and
the
drooping
slopes
and
the
spreading
valleys
the
orchards
and
the
pastures
those
travelling
musics
fill
there
is
my
lost
abana
and
there
is
my
nameless
pharphar
that
mixed
with
my
heart
when
i
was
a
boy
and
time
stood
still
and
i
say
i
will
go
there
and
die
there
but
i
do
not
go
there
and
sometimes
i
think
that
the
train
could
not
carry
me
there
and
it
possible
maybe
that
it
farther
than
asia
or
africa
or
any
voyager
harbour
farther
farther
beyond
recall
o
even
in
memory
i
shall
make
beauty
i
shall
make
beauty
out
of
many
things
lights
colours
motions
sky
and
earth
and
sea
the
soft
unbosoming
of
all
the
springs
which
that
inscrutable
hand
allows
to
me
odours
of
flowers
sounds
of
smitten
strings
the
voice
of
many
a
wind
in
many
a
tree
fields
rivers
moors
swift
feet
and
floating
wings
rocks
caves
and
hills
that
stand
and
clouds
that
flee
men
also
and
women
beautiful
and
dear
shall
come
and
pass
and
leave
a
fragrant
breath
and
my
own
heart
laughter
and
pain
and
fear
the
majesties
of
evil
and
of
death
but
never
never
shall
my
verses
trace
the
loveliness
of
your
most
lovely
face
envoi
beloved
when
my
heart
awake
to
god
and
all
the
world
becomes
his
testimony
in
you
i
most
do
see
in
your
brave
spirit
erect
and
certain
flashing
deeds
of
light
a
pure
jet
from
the
fountain
of
all
being
a
scripture
clearer
than
all
else
to
read
and
when
belief
was
dead
and
god
a
myth
and
the
world
seemed
a
wandering
mote
of
evil
endurable
only
by
its
impermanence
and
all
the
planets
perishable
urns
of
perished
ashes
to
you
alone

unspeakable
loneliness
