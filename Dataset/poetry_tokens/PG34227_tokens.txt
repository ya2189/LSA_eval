note
first
two
of
the
poems
here
printed
have
long
been
popular
favorites
but
the
third
was
not
written
till
near
the
end
of
harte
life
it
rounds
out
the
romance
with
such
completeness
and
charm
that
it
is
peculiarly
fitting
that
the
poems
should
be
grouped
and
issued
in
a
form
worthy
of
their
own
excellence
the
coöperation
of
keller
was
secured
for
making
the
illustrations
not
only
on
account
of
his
recognized
ability
as
an
artist
but
also
because
of
his
admiration
for
harte
writings
and
his
previous
success
in
illustrating
