this
talented
giraffe
can
play
in
such
a
skillful
pleasing
way
that
every
one
who
hears
agrees
that
he
is
master
of
the
keys
so
is
not
strange
at
all
that
he
should
hold
his
head
high
as
you

dogs
went
out
for

all
on
a
summer
day
there
was
dog
and
dog
and
little
doggie
tray
and
as
they
walked
down
the
crowded
street
they
were
proud
as
proud
could
be
for
they
were
dressed
in
their
very
best
as
every
one
could
see
but
a
mischievous
cat
on
the
sidewalk
stood
no
coat
no
hat
had
she
so
she
laughed
at
the
dress
and
the
pompousness
of
the
dog
and
his
family
dog
growled
deep
and
sprang
at
the
cat
and
chased
her
up
and
down
with
an
angry
cry
and
a
flashing
eye
throughout
the
wondering
town

he
tripped
in
his
haste
against
a
stone
and
fell
in

slippery
street
and
when
he
arose
lo
his
stylish
clothes
were

to

she
saw

her
silken
gown

a
heap

wee
baby
dog
was
in
sad
distress
he
sought
for
his
cap
in
vain
his
kilt
was
torn
he
was
all
forlorn
and
his
tears
fell
down
like
rain
but
the
roguish
cat
at
her
fireside
sat
and
thought
of
her
fun
that
day
and
she
jumped
and
danced
and
purred
and
pranced
at
the
doggies

they
say
knew
well
it
was
not
right
to
go
so
far
he
could
not
be
found
though
his
master
searched
the
woods
around
and
so
he
was
out
all
night
but
when
that
pig
came
back
oh
then
he
wished
that
he
had
not
left
the
pen

sorry
he
did
feel
