foreword
poetry
has
been
defined
as
thought
touched
by
emotion
and
i
know
no
better
working
definition
although
no
doubt
more
scientific
and
accurate
ones
could
be
found
the
best
poets
of
all
ages
seem
to
have
had
this
ideal
plainly
before
them
whether
consciously
or
unconsciously
and
i
can
not
see
how
modern
poets
can
dispense
with
either
thought
or
emotion
if
they
are
to
write
real
poetry
for
one
is
not
enough
without
the
other
take
for
example
the
first
lines
of
master
spoon
river
anthology
where
are
elmer
herman
bert
tom
and
charley
the
weak
of
will
the
strong
of
arm
the
clown
the
boozer
the
fighter
all
all
are
sleeping
on
the
hill
one
passed
in
a
fever
one
was
buried
in
a
mine
one
was
killed
in
a
brawl
one
died
in
a
jail
one
fell
from
a
bridge
toiling
for
children
and
wife
all
all
are
sleeping
on
the
hill
this
sounds
tragic
indeed
but
seems
to
have
aroused
no
emotion
on
the
part
of
the
poet
and
excites
none
in
his
readers
in
fact
through
the
whole
poem
emotion
is
held
in
check
with
a
strong
hand
and
only
allowed
to
show
itself
in
some
distorted
cynicism
let
us
take
an
example
of
the
opposite
extreme
where
emotion
whether
real
or
fancied
has
stifled
thought
o
world
o
men
o
sun
to
you
i
cry
i
raise
my
song
defiant
proud
victorious
and
send
this
clarion
ringing
down
the
sky
i
love
i
love
i
love
and
love
is
glorious
the
definition
chosen
need
not
hamper
the
most
modern
poet
nor
restrict
his
choice
of
subject
for
there
are
few
things
that
can
not
awaken
both
thought
and
emotion
if
looked
at
in
the
right
way
an
iron
foundry
and
a
venetian
palace
have
immense
possibilities
of
arousing
both
elements
and
perhaps
the
foundry
has
the
greater
power
the
modern
poet
has
joined
the
great
army
of
seekers
after
freedom
that
is
he
refuses
to
observe
the
old
conventions
in
regard
to
his
subjects
and
his
method
of
treating
them
he
refuses
to
be
bound
by
the
old
restrictions
of
rhyme
and
metre
and
goes
far
afield
in
search
of
material
on
which
to
work
the
boldest
of
the
new
school
would
throw
overboard
all
the
old
forms
and
write
only
in
free
verse
rythmic
prose
or
whatever
he
may
wish
to
call
it
the
conservative
on
the
other
hand
clings
stubbornly
to
the
old
conventions
and
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
vers
libre
or
anything
that
savours
of
it
but
vers
libre
like
the
and
aeroplane
has
come
to
stay
whether
we
like
it
or
no
it
is
not
really
a
new
thing
although
put
to
a
new
use
for
some
of
the
greatest
poetry
of
the
hebrews
and
other
oriental
nations
was
written
in
a
form
of
free
verse
at
the
present
time
the
number
of
those
using
it
as
medium
of
expression
is
steadily
increasing
in
france
italy
the
united
states
and
even
in
conservative
england
the
increase
in
the
number
of
poems
recently
published
in
this
form
has
been
remarkable
the
modernists
hail
this
tendency
as
the
dawn
of
a
new
era
of
freedom
while
the
conservatives
see
poetry
falling
into
decadence
and
ruin
the
right
view
of
the
case
probably
lies
as
it
generally
does
between
the
extremes
there
is
much
beauty
to
be
found
in
walking
in
beaten
paths
or
rambling
in
fields
and
woods
but
perhaps
one
who
sails
the
skies
in
an
aeroplane
may
see
visions
and
feel
emotions
that
never
come
to
those
who
wander
on
foot
along
the
old
paths
of
the
woods
and
fields
below
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
matters
little
in
what
form
a
poem
is
cast
so
long
as
the
form
suits
the
subject
and
does
not
hinder
the
freedom
of
the
poet
thought
and
emotion
and
i
am
enough
to
expect
that
beauty
will
be
revealed
as
well
out
of
this
union
of
thought
emotion
and
beauty
we
could
scarcely
fail
to
get
strength
also
which
term
many
modern
poets
use
to
cover
an
ugliness
that
is
often
nothing
but
disguised
weakness
but
form
alone
will
not
make
even
a
semblance
of
poetry
as
the
following
lines
unimpeachable
in
form
from
sir
walter
scott
plainly
show
then
filled
with
pity
and
remorse
he
sorrowed
the
expiring
horse
nor
can
i
conceive
of
more
beautiful
poetry
than
the
following
by
richard
aldington
although
rhyme
and
regular
metre
are
absent
and
we
turn
from
the
music
of
old
and
the
hills
that
we
loved
and
the
meads
and
we
turn
from
the
fiery
day
and
the
lips
that
were
for
silently
brushing
the
fields
with
feet
with
purple
robe
searing
the
grass
as
with
a
sudden
flame
death
thou
hast
come
upon
us
and
this
brings
me
to
the
real
purpose
of
this
foreword
the
explanation
of
the
title
of
this
book
on
the
hills
and
plains
of
southern
europe
there
grows
a
plant
with
beautiful
indented
leaves
the
acanthus
the
greek
artist
saw
the
beauty
of
these
leaves
and
having
arranged
and
conventionalized
them
carved
them
upon
the
capitals
of
the
columns
which
supported
the
roofs
and
pediments
of
his
temples
and
public
buildings
since
that
time
wherever
pillars
are
used
in
architecture
one
does
not
have
far
to
look
to
find
acanthus
leaves
carved
upon
them
in
the
roman
forum
in
byzantine
churches
like
saint
sophia
or
saint
mark
in
the
mediæval
cathedrals
of
france
england
and
spain
in
the
renaissance
buildings
scattered
throughout
the
world
and
even
in
the
most
modern
of
our
great
cities
this
decoration
of
acanthus
is
to
be
found
and
the
reason
is
not
far
to
seek
a
thing
of
beauty
will
never
pass
into
nothingness
i
recently
saw
a
picture
of
a
corinthian
column
of
a
ruined
greek
temple
standing
against
the
sky
and
broken
fragments
of
its
fellows
lying
at
its
foot
with
wild
vines
climbing
over
them
and
who
could
say
that
one
was
more
beautiful
than
the
other
the
carved
acanthus
leaves
upon
the
column
were
beautiful
because
of
their
symmetry
harmony
of
light
and
shade
and
outline
but
the
wild
grape
was
perhaps
more
beautiful
still
in
its
natural
freedom
so
in
this
little
book
will
be
found
some
poems
in
the
old
conventional
forms
and
some
others
in
free
rhythms
in
which
the
author
has
tried
in
a
humble
way
to
mingle
elements
of
thought
emotion
and
beauty

with

borne
by

wings
across
the
sunlit
blue
they
go
dark
flecks
of
shadow
drifting
by
sometimes
they
bring
a
song
a
joyful
cry
as
morn
and

your
coming
used
to
do
but
sometimes
plaintive
notes
of
sorrow
too
amid
the
joyful
echoes
wail
and
die
then
as
i
watch
the
beating
of
the
wings
that
seek
a
haven
by
far
northern
lakes
and
catch
the
note
of
some
that
sings
or
hear
the
plaintive
cry
of
one
that
breaks
i
turn
once
more
to
things
and
the
old
longing
in
my
heart
awakes
after
tea
see
how
the
agèd
trembling
hands
of
day
spill
over
the
white
cloth
and
blue
red
wine
from
his
last
goblet
poured
away
so
let
me
by
the
window
sit
with
you
and
watch
the
sun
drop
down
behind
the
trees
or
gleam
across
the
snow
a
crimson
bar
for
in
still
mystic
moments
such
as
these
down
unknown
we
may
wander
far
the
crimson
turns
to
purple
on
the
snow
the
orange
sky
grown
gray
and
glimmering
lights
of
scattered
through
the
darkness
glow
but
neither
night
nor
death
my
soul
affrights
for
clear
there
gleams
all
earthly
dark
above
the
of
your
love
through
a
long
cloister
through
a
long
cloister
where
the
gloom
of
night
lingers
in
sombre
silence
all
the
day
across
worn
pavements
crumbling
to
decay
we
wandered
blindly
groping
for
the
light
a
door
swung
wide
and
splendour
infinite
streamed
through
the
painted
glass
and
drove
away
the
lingering
gloom
from
choir
nave
and
bay
and
a
great
minster
glory
met
our
sight
blindly
along
life
cloister
do
we
grope
we
seek
a
gate
that
leads
to
life
immortal
we
see
it
loom
before
us
dim
and
vast
and
doubt
dark
shadow
veil
the
light
of
hope
when
lo
death
hand
flings
wide
the
sombre
portal
and
light
unfading
meets
our
gaze
at
last
cathedral
vespers
the
gloom
of
night
creeps
down
the
shadowy
choir
but
through
the
great
gorgeous
bloom
red
shafts
of
sunset
fall
upon
a
tomb
and
makes
the
gray
stone
burn
a
crimson
pyre
the
creeping
tide
of
darkness
rises
higher
tall
ghostly
pillars
through
the
shadows
loom
and
from
dim
altars
through
the
minster
gloom
pale
yellow
gleams
the
guttering
candles
fire
sudden
from
out
the
shadow
streams
a
song
a
sword
of
sound
that
cleaves
the
dark
in
twain
and
rings
and
glows
triumphant
swift
and
strong
victorious
over
sorrow
death
and
pain
and
golden
visions
pass
before
my
soul
as
through
dim
arches
the
last
echoes
roll
the
with
silent
feet
in
trailing
robes
of
white
they
crept
from
shadowy
temples
far
beyond
tall
bamboo
groves
to
seek
the
that
gleamed
like
some
dark
jewel
through
the
night
upon
great
buddha
breast
the
crimson
height
echoed
their
chanting
as
the
morning
dawned
and
each
bud
breaking
from
its
silver
bond
lifted
its
cup
to
catch
the
golden
light
and
here
beside
this
northern
lake
encircled
by
tall
spires
of
gothic
firs
the
ancient
wakes
and
stirs
within
me
as
i
watch
the
morning
break
upon
white
whose
lips
agleam
whisper
the
secret
of
the
dream
the
broken
mast
it
lies
alone
upon
a
shore
above
a
crescent
beach
of
silver
sand
flung
high
upon
the
rocks
by
some
great
hand
stretched
from
the
dark
whose
fingers
clutched
and
tore
the
from
the
ship
above
it
soar
white
gulls
and
near
in
tangle
stand
old
twisted
pines
where
of
the
land
mingle
soft
singing
with
the
ocean
roar
and
through
long
summer
days
it
dreams
old
dreams
of
southern
forests
and
the
sighing
of
boughs
above
streams
but
when
the
storm
sets
the
white
spindrift
flying
it
thrills
and
trembles
with
the
old
unrest
and
shakes
the
petals
from
its
breast
the
of
bruges
her
hands
upon
her
apron
lie
idle
and
still
against
the
sunset
glow
tall
poplars
stand
and
silent
barges
go
along
the
green
canal
that
wanders
by
a
lean
red
finger
pointing
to
the
sky
the
spire
of
notre
dame
above
a
row
of
dim
gray
arches
where
the
sunbeams
die
the
ancient
belfry
guards
the
square
below
one
august
eve
she
stood
in
that
same
square
and
gazed
and
listened
proud
beneath
her
tears
to
see
her
soldier
passing
down
the
street
the
beat
of
drums
and
trumpets
blare
with
bursts
of
fiendish
music
smite
her
ears
and
mingle
with
the
tread
of
trampling
feet
august

in

mystic

flight

rich
gleamed
the
painted
windows
wondrous
fair

chimes
and
chanting
mingled
in
the

clouds

the
vaulted
height

on

like
a
beacon
light
the
gold

glittered
in

candles

no
bells
no
choirs
no
incense

for
thou
o

art
prey
of
evil
powers
but
with
a
voice
a
thousand
times
more
loud
than
echoing
round

mute

to
all

and
burns
upon
the
western
sky
leaving
behind
the
darkness
of
the
night
the
long
day
over
and
the
battle
won
they
seek
for
rest
beyond
the
setting
sun
peace
now
peace
at
last
is
hovering
the
world
on
silver
wings
and
golden
trumpets
blow
home
from
the
long
crusade
the
warriors
go
victorious
knights
with
banners
wide
unfurled
bow
down
your
head
for
these
have
passed
where
swirled
great
tides
of
darkness
ebbing
too
and
fro
their
eyes
have
seen
fiery
tempests
glow
how
youth
at
death
its
dauntless
challenge
hurled
and
these
are
they
who
saw
the
holy
grail
brimming
with
youthful
blood
like
ruddy
wine
poured
out
in
sacrifice
the
light
divine
before
whose
awful
glow
they
did
not
quail
now
beckons
us
and
shall
our
footsteps
fail
to
follow
where
they
set
the
sign
november
hidden
treasure
o
boy
with
the
wondering
eyes
do
you
see
the
blue
of
the
summer
skies
do
you
hear
the
song
of
the
drowsy
stream
as
it
winds
by
the
shore
where
the
birches
gleam
then
come
come
away
from
the
shadowy
bay
and
we
drift
with
the
stream
where
the
rapids
play
for
we
are
two
pirates
fierce
and
bold
and
we
capture
the
hoard
of
the
morning
gold
a
roving
craft
is
our
red
canoe
o
pirate
chief
with
the
eyes
of
blue
so
hoist
your
flag
with
the
skull
on
high
and
out
we
sail
where
the
treasures
lie
for
in
days
of
old
came
pirates
bold
with
a
spanish
galleon
captured
gold
and
their
boat
was
wrecked
on
the
river
strand
and
its
treasures
strewn
on
the
silver
sand
now
steady
all
as
we
dash
along
the
rapids
are
swift
but
our
paddles
are
strong
and
soon
we
drift
with
the
water
flow
where
the
treasure
lies
hid
in
the
shallows
below
o
cool
and
dim
its
brim
is
the
pool
where
the
swallows
dip
and
skim
so
we
plunge
by
the
prow
of
our
red
canoe
for
the
treasure
that
lies
in
the
quivering
blue
now
home
once
more
to
the
shadowy
bay
for
we
captured
the
gold
of
the
summer
day
and
emeralds
green
from
the
banks
along
and
silver
bars
from
the
song
no
pirates
bore
such
a
glittering
store
from
the
treasure
ships
of
the
days
of
yore
as
the
spoils
we
have
won
on
the
shining
stream
while
we
drifted
along
in
a
golden
dream
a
river
sunset
red
sunlight
fades
from
wood
and
town
the
western
sky
is
gaunt
drift
silent
down
upon
the
river
gleaming
tide
the
hills
clear
outlines
melt
away
or
veil
themselves
in
purple
light
and
burning
thoughts
that
vexed
the
day
become
fair
visions
of
the
night
the
madonna
she
shivered
and
crouched
in
the
immigrant
shed
in
the
midst
of
the
surging
crowd
her
hands
were
warped
with
the
years
of
toil
and
her
young
form
bent
and
bowed
her
eyes
looked
forth
with
a
frightened
glance
at
the
throng
that
round
her
pressed
but
her
face
was
the
face
of
the
mother
of
god
as
she
looked
at
the
babe
on
her
breast
an
idol
in
a
shop
window
old
lohan
peers
through
the
dusty
glass
from
a
jumble
of
curios
quaint
and
rare
and
he
watches
the
hurrying
crowds
that
pass
the
whole
day
long
through
the
ancient
square
wrapped
in
his
robe
of
gold
and
jade
here
by
the
window
he
patiently
waits
for
the
sound
that
the
gongs
and
the
conches
made
in
the
days
of
old
at
the
temple
gates
he
heaves
no
sighs
and
he
sheds
no
tears
for
his
heart
is
bronze
and
he
does
not
know
that
his
temple
has
been
for
a
thousand
years
but
a
mound
of
dust
where
the
bamboos
grow
so
here
he
sits
through
the
nights
and
the
days
and
the
sun
goes
up
and
down
the
sky
but
he
often
looks
with
a
wistful
gaze
at
the
crowds
that
always
pass
him
by
and
his
eyes
half
closed
in
a
mystic
dream
of
his
of
long
ago
turn
back
to
the
shores
of
the
sacred
stream
and
the
kneeling
throng
he
used
to
know
but
he
sometimes
smiles
as
he
sees
the
crowd
of
human
folks
that
pass
him
by
then
he
wraps
himself
in
his
mystic
shroud
and
the
sun
once
more
goes
down
the
sky
in
a
forest
silver
birch
and
dusky
pine
reaching
up
to
find
the
light
from
the
forest
gloomy
night
from
the
thicket
where
entwine
stunted
shrub
and
creeping
vine
from
the
damp
where
glows
and
the
poison
fungus
grows
high
you
lift
your
heads
o
trees
to
the
kisses
of
the
breeze
to
the
vaulted
sky
to
the
clouds
that
pass
you
by
to
the
sun
that
shines
on
high
from
the
dusk
of
earthly
night
strive
o
soul
to
reach
the
light
the
golden
bowl
seeing
a
picture
of
a
boy
gazing
at
a
golden
bowl
which
among
eastern
nations
was
a
symbol
of
in
a
dream
he
seems
to
lie
gazing
at
the
golden
bowl
where
dim
visions
passing
by
whisper
vaguely
to
his
soul
restless
phantoms
come
and
go
crowned
with
cypress
or
with
bay
sad
or
merry
swift
or
slow
tread
they
down
the
winding
way
still
the
pageant
winds
along
youth
and
age
and
love
and
lust
till
at
last
the
motley
throng
fades
and
crumbles
into
dust
all
in
vain
upon
the
bowl
gaze
the
wondering
boyish
eyes
he
shall
read
its
hidden
scroll
only
when
it
shattered
lies
for
a
wondrous
light
shall
gleam
from
the
scattered
fragments
born
boy
dream
on
for
life
a
dream
followed
by
a
golden
morn
on
a
swiss
mountain
lad
the
mighty
hills
are
calling
hills
of
promise
gleaming
bright
and
the
floods
of
sunshine
falling
fill
their
deepest
vales
with
light
there
the
young
dawn
golden
fire
beckons
to
a
brighter
day
untrod
paths
of
youth
desire
heights
unconquered
far
away
steep
and
dark
and
winds
the
pathway
to
the
height
sturdy
youth
with
heart
undaunted
deems
the
toiling
short
and
light
short
or
long
an
easy
master
gives
each
tired
toiler
rest
counts
not
failure
or
disaster
if
the
striving
be
the
best
go
lad
go
is
life
that
calls
you
mates
of
old
must
soothe
their
pain
mindless
of
befalls
you
if
but
honour
still
remain
the
nun
garden
they
have
made
me
a
lovely
garden
with
walls
that
are
rugged
and
gray
they
have
filled
it
with
pinks
and
roses
and
lilies
that
bloom
but
a
day
but
the
walls
are
so
high
and
frowning
and
the
paths
are
so
smooth
and
straight
and
even
their
smallest
winding
leads
straight
to
the
chapel
gate
i
have
planted
a
bed
of
pansies
along
by
the
chapel
wall
but
though
i
have
watered
and
weeded
they
never
have
blossomed
at
all
the
sunshine
of
god
can
not
fall
there
for
the
chapel
tower
is
too
high
so
under
its
cold
gray
shadow
my
poor
little
blossoms
die
the
mother
of
god
in
marble
gleams
white
where
the
willows
toss
and
at
the
far
end
of
the
pathway
the
dear
christ
hangs
on
the
cross
and
when
the
vespers
are
over
if
i
have
not
sinned
all
day
i
may
walk
to
the
end
of
the
garden
and
kneel
by
the
cross
and
pray
but
oh
for
the
wild
wild
garden
that
i
knew
in
the
days
gone
by
where
the
birches
and
elms
and
maples
stretched
up
to
the
sky
where
murmuring
silver
music
the
brook
through
the
ferny
dell
ran
down
to
the
fields
of
clover
but
hush
there
the
vesper
bell
you
went
away
in
summertime
you
went
away
in
summertime
when
leaves
and
flowers
were
young
and
birds
still
lingered
in
the
fields
with
many
songs
unsung
i
glad
it
was
in
summertime
when
skies
were
clear
and
blue
i
could
not
say
to
you
and
bear
the
winter
too
to
a
modern
poet
why
must
you
sing
of
sorrow
when
the
world
is
so
full
of
woe
why
must
you
sing
of
the
ugly
for
the
ugly
and
sad
i
know
why
will
you
sing
of
railways
of
iron
and
steel
and
coal
and
the
din
of
the
smoky
cities
for
these
will
not
feed
my
soul
but
sing
to
me
songs
of
beauty
to
gladden
my
tired
eyes
the
beauty
of
waving
forest
of
meadows
and
sunlit
skies
sing
me
of
childish
laughter
of
cradles
and
painted
toys
of
the
sea
and
the
brooks
and
the
rivers
and
the
shouting
of
bathing
boys
for
the
earth
has
a
store
of
beauty
deep
hid
from
our
blinded
eyes
and
only
the
poet
knows
just
where
the
treasure
lies
so
lead
me
from
paths
that
are
ugly
from
the
dust
of
the
city
street
to
paths
that
are
fringed
with
flowers
where
the
sky
and
the
meadows
meet
and
though
sorrow
may
walk
beside
me
to
the
far
far
end
of
the
road
if
beauty
but
beckon
me
onward
less
heavy
will
seem
my
load
and
led
in
the
paths
of
beauty
the
world
from
its
strife
will
cease
for
i
know
that
the
paths
of
beauty
lead
on
to
the
paths
of
peace
the
mystic
the
mystic
sits
by
the
sacred
stream
watching
the
sun
as
it
mounts
the
sky
and
life
to
him
is
a
haunting
dream
or
a
motley
pageant
passing
by
sorrow
and
joy
go
on
their
way
passion
and
lust
and
love
and
hate
only
a
band
of
mummers
they
blindly
led
by
the
hand
of
fate
though
the
pageant
is
real
and
himself
the
dream
though
men
are
born
and
strive
and
die
yet
the
mystic
sits
by
the
sacred
stream
watching
the
sun
go
down
the
sky
ad
episcopi
collegium
here
in
the
beautiful
valley
here
where
the
fair
rivers
meeting
mingle
their
waters
in
silence
and
wander
afar
to
the
sea
now
does
thy
son
returning
offer
thee
homage
and
greeting
now
do
my
wandering
footsteps
turn
o
mother
to
thee
gleam
in
the
light
of
the
sunset
cross
and
turret
and
tower
mirrored
majestic
and
silent
down
by
the
shore
far
through
the
valley
resounding
telling
the
evensong
hour
echoes
the
old
bell
tolling
calling
me
back
once
more
here
in
the
halls
where
i
lingered
there
in
the
woods
where
i
wandered
on
campus
and
river
and
hillside
other
young
lives
are
aglow
dreaming
the
dreams
that
i
dreamed
thinking
the
thoughts
that
i
pondered
deeming
the
pathway
long
and
the
hours
slow
rejoice
young
hearts
in
your
youth
morn
is
the
time
for
gladness
time
to
sow
for
a
harvest
which
all
too
soon
you
must
reap
bright
be
the
hour
of
your
noontide
with
never
a
shadow
of
sadness
golden
the
gleam
of
your
evening
with
silence
and
rest
and
sleep
glows
the
west
crimson
and
gold
far
down
the
glorious
river
cross
and
tower
and
turret
fade
in
the
gloom
of
the
night
yet
will
my
heart
remember
both
mother
and
sons
forever
far
though
the
pathway
may
lead
me
swift
though
the
years
in
their
flight
a
song
of
the
homeland
i
sing
you
a
song
of
the
homeland
though
the
strains
be
of
little
worth
a
song
of
our
own
loved
homeland
of
the
noblest
land
upon
earth
where
the
tide
of
the
sea
from
oceans
three
beats
high
in
its
triple
might
where
the
winds
are
born
in
a
southern
morn
and
die
in
a
polar
night
i
sing
you
a
song
of
the
eastland
of
the
land
where
our
fathers
died
where
saxon
and
frank
their
feuds
long
dead
are
sleeping
side
by
side
where
their
sons
still
toil
on
the
soil
of
the
mighty
river
plain
where
the
censer
swings
and
the
angelus
rings
and
the
old
faith
lives
again
i
sing
you
a
song
of
the
westland
where
the
magic
cities
rise
and
the
prairies
clothed
with
their
golden
grain
stretch
under
the
azure
skies
where
the
mountains
grim
in
the
clouds
grow
dim
far
north
in
the
arctic
land
and
the
northern
light
in
its
mystic
flight
flares
over
the
golden
strand
and
i
sing
of
the
men
of
the
homeland
from
the
north
and
east
and
west
the
men
who
went
to
the
homeland
call
ah
god
we
have
given
our
best
but
not
in
vain
are
our
heroes
slain
if
under
the
darkened
skies
all
hand
in
hand
from
strand
to
strand
a
nation
rise
the
mirror
your
mirror
love
reflects
your
smile
as
skies
the
coming
dawn
but
oh
how
blank
the
weary
while
when
you
are
gone
my
life
a
mirror
with
you
near
is
filled
with
joy
the
day
but
oh
how
meaningless
and
drear
with
you
away
i
made
a
little
song
i
made
a
little
song
and
then
i
wandered
down
broadway
and
saw
the
strange
mad
people
run
and
dance
about
me
in
the
sun
or
dive
into
the
underground
like
rabbits
frightened
by
the
sound
of
their
own
scampering
through
the
grass
i
watched
a
thousand
people
pass
but
not
a
one
did
i
hear
say
i
made
a
little
song
i
made
a
little
song
it
sang
beside
me
all
the
way
until
i
reached
the
lower
town
where
crowds
went
surging
up
and
down
their
eyes
were
hard
and
faces
white
but
some
of
them
looked
glad
and
bright
because
the
bulls
or
was
it
bears
had
brought
them
gold
for
worthless
shares
but
i
was
happier
than
they
i
made
a
little
song
birds
i
lie
beneath
a
dark
green
pine
where
sunbeams
scarcely
ever
shine
and
if
i
still
as
still
can
be
shy
forest
birds
come
down
to
me
brown
thrushes
run
along
the
ground
goldfinches
flit
without
a
sound
and
with
ruby
throats
alight
to
smooth
their
emerald
coats
and
when
some
day
alone
i
lie
beneath
the
sky
i
glad
to
know
the
birds
will
come
to
welcome
me
to
my
new
home
for
i
will
lie
so
still
that
they
will
linger
by
me
all
the
day
and
lulled
at
evening
by
their
song
i
shall
not
find
the
darkness
long
the
bluebird
wing
one
day
i
saw
the
bluebird
wing
agleam
upon
a
waving
sea
of
timothy
we
walked
together
you
and
i
we
saw
the
bluebird
gliding
by
he
came
so
near
the
mad
wild
thing
we
almost
touched
his
sapphire
wing
but
ere
across
our
path
he
flew
he
rose
and
vanished
in
the
blue
i
saw
the
bluebird
wing
i
heard
round
me
sing
across
the
april
sky
great
swelling
drifted
by
and
on
the
silver
sheen
white
birches
danced
in
frills
of
green
and
all
the
world
was
mad
with
spring
but
you
were
miles
and
miles
away
the
bluebird
wing
was
dull
and
gray
the
answer
why
do
i
lie
upon
the
ground
and
listen
to
the
silver
sound
of
water
flowing
from
a
spring
it
sings
a
song
i
can
not
sing
why
am
i
gazing
at
the
sky
to
watch
the
clouds
go
trailing
by
pearl
ships
upon
a
sapphire
sea
they
seek
a
land
unknown
to
me
why
do
i
listen
to
the
song
of
singing
all
day
long
the
secret
that
their
songs
unfold
ten
thousand
bards
have
left
untold
wild
grape
wild
grape
beneath
the
crawling
shadow
of
a
crumbling
temple
to
gods
the
wild
grape
twines
amid
the
fragments
of
shattered
pillars
prone
upon
the
ground
and
its
dark
leaves
hide
from
sight
the
broken
sculptures
of
faun
and
youth
and
maiden
that
once
stood
in
the
temple
pediment
young
naked
beautiful
in
wild
freedom
it
climbs
over
the
carved
acanthus
leaves
of
the
crumbling
columns
and
weaves
a
funeral
wreath
over
their
dead
beauty
the
wild
bees
hum
and
buzz
among
the
heavy
with
honeyed
perfume
under
the
drowsy
noonday
sun
that
spills
its
amber
wine
from
a
full
goblet
over
the
thirsting
hillside
wanton
and
wild
like
an
unhappy
lover
clinging
to
the
breast
of
his
dead
mistress
the
vine
clings
in
voluptuous
embrace
about
the
naked
pallid
forms
and
mingles
there
with
the
eternal
beauty
of
youth
and

gleaming
against

that
surround

a
dream
of
beauty
that
lingers
forever
a
dream
of
the
amethyst

a
dream
of

jacinth
blue

still
waters
reflecting
white

your
white
arms

my

goes
forth
with
your
dream
to
wander
you
lead
me
into
a
moonlit
garden
beside
the

white
in
the
moonlight
gleams
the
temple
cutting
the
purple
sky
with
its
pediment
diamonds
and
sapphires
fall
from
the
fountain
black
are
the
cypress
trees
the
gods
are
asleep
in
the
silent
temple
only
the
lapping
of
waves
on
the
mingles
its
drowsy
rhythmical
beating
with
the
bells
of
the
fountain
soft
lie
the
on
the
cool
grasses
not
in
vain
are
your
white
arms
lifted
and
my
dream
of
beauty
and
your
dream
eternal
embrace
in
the
moonlight
omnipresence
what
are
the
great
pine
boughs
that
stretch
over
me
so
lovingly
shielding
me
from
the
heat
they
are
the
sheltering
arms
of
god
visible
against
white
drifting
clouds
and
the
trailing
white
clouds
what
are
they
they
are
the
tattered
clothes
bordered
with
broken
pearls
cast
off
by
the
angels
and

by
god
himself
my
cathedral
all
my
life
long
i
have
loved
cathedrals
their
gray
mysterious
vaults
and
arches
are
the
home
of
peace
and
beauty
and
sometimes
too
of
hope
their
roofs
of
stone
and
walls
of
painted
glass
shut
out
the
noisy
world
and
protect
tired
eyes
from
the
glare
of
day
their
and
organs
thrill
lonely
hearts
their
blue
welling
clouds
of
incense
bring
a
pungent
smell
as
of
burning
flowers
and
their
gleaming
candles
beckon
like
lights
of
home
across
the
twilight
and
now
i
have
a
cathedral
all
my
own
it
has
great
pine
trunks
for
pillars
for
painted
windows
red
and
golden
leaves
white
slender
birches
are
the
and
the
great
organ
the
winds
of
god
playing
among
the
the
prim
little
spruces
are
virgin
nuns
telling
their
beads
in
drops
of
dew
and
the
bare
broken
are
hooded
monks
shattered
by
worldly
storms
but
now
in
a
safe
refuge
beneath
my
cathedral
dome
the
sparrows
chant
prime
for
me
the
rings
the
vesper
bell
from
beds
of
fern
roll
perfumed
clouds

incense

from

great

god
himself
looks
forth
in
the
red
glory
of
the
dawn
the
foundry
two
monsters
iron
and
coal
sleep
in
the
darkness
a
poisonous
scarlet
breath
blows
over
them
and
they
awake
hissing
and
writhing
and
spew
forth
vomit
in
streams
like
fiery
serpents
then
from
the
reeking
pools
a
monstrous
brood
is
born
black
strong
beautiful

we
turn
away
our
tired
eyes
and
try
to
find
the

a
mighty
string
of
pearls
which
day
has
laid
aside
flaunt
their
alluring

them

i
saw
a
vision
of
beauty
my
eyes
looked
through
the
mists
of
ages
back
to
the
glorious
years
when
beauty
itself
was
god
and
i
saw
the
waves
of
the
blue
ægean
turquoise
sapphire
jacinth
and
amethyst
mingled
and
i
heard
the
singing
of
the
water
as
of
playing
of
distant
pipes
by
slender
shepherd
lads
among
the
hills
then
i
turned
away
from
the
shore
and
i
saw
the
pediment
of
a
great
temple
standing
white
against
the
sky
and
beneath
the
pediment
rows
of
marble
columns
like
giant
trees
in
a
forest
of
frozen
beauty
statues
gleamed
amid
the
dark
foliage
of
cypress
and
olive
trees
statues
of
gods
and
goddesses
youths
and
maidens
horses
of
ruddy
bronze
and
chariots
of
beaten
brass
my
feet
trod
the
steps
of
the
marble
stairway
and
i
went
a
worshipper
to
the
great
temple
whose
burnished
doors
stood
wide
ajar
gleaming
like
the
portal
of
a
dream
city
i
lifted
my
arms
in
adoration
and
my
soul
drank
its
fill
from
the
pure
greek
of
beauty
ii
i
saw
a
vision
of
faith
my
eyes
were
turned
to
a
mediæval
city
of
crowded
houses
from
which
there
rose
a
great
cathedral
with
walls
of
chiselled
stone
and
spires
that
pierced
into
the
blue
here
men
had
wrought
with
hands
and
heart
and
brain
long
years
in
wood
and
stone
until
they
reared
a
gorgeous
temple
to
do
honour
to
their
god
i
entered
in
and
saw
the
walls
agleam
with
painted
glass
more
brilliant
than
the
jewels
of
eastern
kings
i
heard
the
organ
like
winds
sweeping
across
the
sea
and
the
voices
of
the
like
soft
ripples
on
the
velvet
sand
with
golden
cross
and
smoking
censers
and
priests
in
robes
of
scarlet
and
purple
the
procession
passed
along
then
the
great
sweating
throng
bowed
low
upon
the
stony
floor
before
the
host
and
when
the
echoing
music
had
vanished
in
the
soaring
vault
above
the
crowd
went
forth
from
the
gorgeous
gloom
comforted
into
the
golden
my
soul
too
was
comforted
for
it
had
drunk
deep
from
the
pure
mediæval
well
of
faith
iii
i
saw
a
vision
of
love
upon
the
field
of
battle
amid
dust
and
smoke
and
shrouds
of
poisonous
vapour
red
streams
of
youthful
blood
were
poured
upon
the
ground
generously
joyfully
that
the
world
might
not
die
from
its
festering
wounds
but
might
drink
health
and
life
from
these
pure
youthful
streams
then
i
stood
awed
and
dumb
for
here
was
love
supreme
iv
i
saw
a
vision
of
death
silence
held
my
feet
with
clinging
hands
and
darkness
put
heavy
fingers
across
my
eyes
then
darkness
raised
her
hands
and
i
saw
in
the
gray
shadows
a
great
with
sable
folded
wings
it
seemed
asleep
upon
a
purple
flower
but
as
i
watched
slowly
it
spread
its
wings
and
from
them
shone
a
gleam
of
crimson
dawn
and
all
the
world
was
drenched
in
showers
of
light
then
with
his
flaming
wings
outspread
the
great
moth
sailed
away
like
a
scarlet
boat
upon
a
sea
leaving
behind
a
wake
of
golden
light
and
i
know
that
my
vision
of
death
was
only
a
vision
