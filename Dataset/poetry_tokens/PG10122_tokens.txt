but
what
the
use
of
setting
down
that
glorious
blaze
behind
the
town
you
only
skip
the
page
you
look
for
newer
pictures
in
this
book
you
read
of
sunsets
rich
as
mine
fresh
wind
fills
the
evening
air
with
horrid
crying
of
night
birds
but
what
reads
new
or
curious
there
when
cold
winds
fly
across
the
air
you
only
frown
you
turn
the
page
but
find
no
glimpse
of
your
new
age
of
poetry
in
my
words
must
winds
that
cut
like
blades
of
steel
and
sunsets
swimming
in
volnay
the
holiest
cruellest
pains
i
feel
die
stillborn
because
old
men
squeal
for
something
new
write
something
new
we
read
this
poem
that
one
too
and
twelve
more
like
yesterday
no
no
my
chicken
i
shall
scrawl
just
what
i
fancy
as
i
strike
it
fairies
and
fusiliers
and
all
old
broken
thought
will
crawl
across
my
verse
in
the
classic
way
and
sir
be
careful
what
you
say
there
are
folk
still
like
it
an
old
man
is
that
the
strabo
mine
marching
below
and
we
still
gulping
wine
from
the
sad
magic
of
his
fragrant
cup
the
old
centurion
started
up
cursed
battered
on
the
table
no
he
said
not
that
the
dead
dead
in
the
first
year
of
this
damned
campaign
the
legion
dead
dead
and
wo
rise
again
pity
rome
pities
her
brave
lads
that
die
but
we
need
pity
also
you
and
i
whom
gallic
spear
and
belgian
arrow
miss
who
live
to
see
the
legion
come
to
this
unsoldierlike
slovenly
bent
on
loot
grumblers
diseased
unskilled
to
thrust
or
shoot
o
brown
cheek
muscled
shoulder
sturdy
thigh
where
are
they
now
god
watch
it
struggle
by
the
sullen
pack
of
ragged
ugly
swine
is
that
the
legion
gracchus
quick
the
wine
strabo
said
gracchus
you
are
strange
tonight
the
legion
is
the
legion
it
all
right
if
these
new
men
are
slovenly
in
your
thinking
god
damn
it
you
not
better
them
by
drinking
they
all
try
strabo
trust
their
hearts
and
hands
the
legion
is
the
legion
while
rome
stands
and
these
same
men
before
the
autumn
fall
shall
bang
old
vercingetorix
out
of
gaul
to
lucasta
on
going
to
the
war
for
the
fourth
time
it
does
matter
what
the
cause
what
wrong
they
say
we
righting
a
curse
for
treaties
bonds
and
laws
when
we
to
do
the
fighting
and
since
we
lads
are
proud
and
true
what
else
remains
to
do
lucasta
when
to
france
your
man
returns
his
fourth
time
hating
war
yet
laughs
as
calmly
as
he
can
and
flings
an
oath
but
says
no
more
that
is
not
courage
that
not
fear
lucasta
he
a
fusilier
and
his
pride
sends
him
here
let
statesmen
bluster
bark
and
bray
and
so
decide
who
started
this
bloody
war
and
who
to
pay
but
he
must
be
must
sit
and
stake
with
quiet
breath
playing
at
cards
with
death
do
plume
yourself
he
fights
for
you
it
is
no
courage
love
or
hate
but
let
us
do
the
things
we
do
it
pride
that
makes
the
heart
be
great
it
is
not
anger
no
nor
fear
lucasta
he
a
fusilier
and
his
pride
keeps
him
here
two
fusiliers
and
have
we
done
with
war
at
last
well
we
been
lucky
devils
both
and
there
no
need
of
pledge
or
oath
to
bind
our
lovely
friendship
fast
by
firmer
stuff
close
bound
enough
by
wire
and
wood
and
stake
we
bound
by
fricourt
and
by
festubert
by
whipping
rain
by
the
sun
glare
by
all
the
misery
and
loud
sound
by
a
spring
day
by
picard
clay
show
me
the
two
so
closely
bound
as
we
by
the
red
bond
of
blood
by
friendship
blossoming
from
mud
by
death
we
faced
him
and
we
found
beauty
in
death

dead

robert
nichols
from
frise
on
the
somme
in
february
in
answer
to
a
letter
saying
i
am
just
finishing
my
holiday
i
wish
you
were
here
to
feed
him
with
cherries
here
by
a
snowbound
river
in
scrapen
holes
we
shiver
and
like
old
bitterns
we
boom
to
you
plaintively
robert
how
can
i
rhyme
verses
for
your
desire
sleek
fauns
and
vague
music
and
green
trees
hot
sun
and
gentle
breeze
england
in
june
attire
and
life
born
young
again
for
your
gay
goatish
brute
drunk
with
warm
melody
singing
on
beds
of
thyme
with
red
and
rolling
eye
all
the
devonian
plain
lips
dark
with
juicy
stain
ears
hung
with
bobbing
fruit
why
should
i
keep
him
time
why
in
this
cold
and
rime
where
even
to
dream
is
pain
no
robert
there
no
reason
cherries
are
out
of
season
ice
grips
at
branch
and
root
and
singing
birds
are
mute
dead
cow
farm
an
ancient
saga
tells
us
how
in
the
beginning
the
first
cow
for
nothing
living
yet
had
birth
but
elemental
cow
on
earth
began
to
lick
cold
stones
and
mud
under
her
warm
tongue
flesh
and
blood
blossomed
a
miracle
to
believe
and
so
was
adam
born
and
eve
here
now
is
chaos
once
again
primeval
mud
cold
stones
and
rain
here
flesh
decays
and
blood
drips
red
and
the
cow
dead
the
old
cow
dead
goliath
and
david
for
killed
at
fricourt
march
yet
once
an
earlier
david
took
smooth
pebbles
from
the
brook
out
between
the
lines
he
went
to
that
tournament
a
shepherd
boy
who
stood
out
fine
and
young
to
fight
a
philistine
clad
all
in
brazen
mail
he
swears
that
he
killed
lions
he
killed
bears
and
those
that
scorn
the
god
of
zion
shall
perish
so
like
bear
or
lion
but
the
historian
of
that
fight
had
not
the
heart
to
tell
it
right
striding
within
javelin
range
goliath
marvels
at
this
strange
boy
so
proud
of
strength
david
clear
eye
measures
the
length
with
hand
thrust
back
he
cramps
one
knee
poises
a
moment
thoughtfully
and
hurls
with
a
long
vengeful
swing
the
pebble
humming
from
the
sling
like
a
wild
bee
flies
a
sure
line
for
the
forehead
of
the
philistine
then
but
there
comes
a
brazen
clink
and
quicker
than
a
man
can
think
goliath
shield
parries
each
cast
clang
clang
and
clang
was
david
last
scorn
blazes
in
the
giant
eye
towering
unhurt
six
cubits
high
says
foolish
david
damn
your
shield
and
damn
my
sling
but
i
not
yield
he
takes
his
staff
of
mamre
oak
a
knotted
that
broke
the
skull
of
many
a
wolf
and
fox
come
filching
lambs
from
jesse
flocks
loud
laughs
goliath
and
that
laugh
can
scatter
chariots
like
blown
chaff
to
rout
but
david
calm
and
brave
holds
his
ground
for
god
will
save
steel
crosses
wood
a
flash
and
oh
shame
for
beauty
overthrow
god
eyes
are
dim
his
ears
are
shut

a

his
truth

but
dim
and
all
poetry
with
him
rhyme
and

flow
in
plenty
for
the
lad
of

spring
for
him
is
no
more
now
than
daisies
to
a
munching
cow
just
a
cheery
pleasant
season

to
live
at
ease

man
with

now
there
no

all
that
matters
now
is
getting
the
fun
come
along
ben
and
claire
plenty
to
be
done
then
old
philosopher
wisest
man
alive
plays
at
lions
and
tigers
down
along
the
drive
gambolling
fiercely
through
bushes
and
grass
making
monstrous
mouths
braying
like
an
ass
twisting
buttercups
in
his
orange
hair
hopping
like
a
kangaroo
growling
like
a
bear
right
up

they
frolic
there
my
legs
wingle
says
ben
to
claire
the
cruel
moon
the
cruel
moon
hangs
out
of
reach
up
above
the
shadowy
beech
her
face
is
stupid
but
her
eye
is
small
and
sharp
and
very
sly
nurse
says
the
moon
can
drive
you
mad
no
that
a
silly
story
lad
though
she
be
angry
though
she
would
destroy
all
england
if
she
could
yet
think
what
damage
can
she
do
hanging
there
so
far
from
you
do
heed
what
frightened
nurses
say
moons
hang
much
too
far
away
finland
feet
and
faces
tingle
in
that
frore
land
legs
wobble
and
go
wingle
you
scarce
can
stand
the
skies
are
jewelled
all
around
the
ploughshare
snaps
in
the
iron
ground
the
finn
with
face
like
paper
and
eyes
like
a
lighted
taper
hurls
his
rough
rune
at
the
wintry
moon
and
stamps
to
mark
the
tune
a
pinch
of
salt
when
a
dream
is
born
in
you
with
a
sudden
clamorous
pain
when
you
know
the
dream
is
true
and
lovely
with
no
flaw
nor
stain
o
then
be
careful
or
with
sudden
clutch
you
hurt
the
delicate
thing
you
prize
so
much
dreams
are
like
a
bird
that
mocks
flirting
the
feathers
of
his
tail
when
you
seize
at
the
over
the
hedge
you
see
him
sail
old
birds
are
neither
caught
with
salt
nor
chaff
they
watch
you
from
the
apple
bough
and
laugh
poet
never
chase
the
dream
laugh
yourself
and
turn
away
mask
your
hunger
let
it
seem
small
matter
if
he
come
or
stay
but
when
he
nestles
in
your
hand
at
last
close
up
your
fingers
tight
and
hold
him
fast
the
caterpillar
under
this
loop
of
honeysuckle
a
creeping
coloured
caterpillar
i
gnaw
the
fresh
green
hawthorn
spray
i
nibble
it
leaf
by
leaf
away
down
beneath
grow
dandelions
daisies
rooks
flap
croaking
across
the
lane
i
eat
and
swallow
and
eat
again
here
come
raindrops
i
munch
and
nibble
unregarding
hawthorn
leaves
are
juicy
and
firm
i
mind
my
business
i
a
good
worm
when
i
old
tired
melancholy
i
build
a
mausoleum
close
by
here
on
this
lovely
spray
and
die
and
dream
the
ages
away
some
say
worms
win
resurrection
with
white
wings
beating
but
wings
or
a
sound
sleep
why
should
i
care
either
way
i
miss
my
share
under
this
loop
of
honeysuckle
a
hungry
hairy
caterpillar
i
crawl
on
my
high
and
swinging
seat
and
eat
eat
eat
as
one
ought
to
eat
sorley
weather
when
outside
the
icy
rain
comes
leaping
shall
i
tie
my
restive
brain
snugly
under
shelter
shall
i
make
a
gentle
song
here
in
my
firelit
study
when
outside
the
winds
blow
strong
and
the
lanes
are
muddy
with
old
wine
and
drowsy
meats
am
i
to
fill
my
belly
shall
i
glutton
here
with
keats
shall
i
drink
with
shelley
tobacco
pleasant
firelight
good
poetry
makes
both
better
clay
is
wet
and
so
is
mud
winter
rains
are
wetter
yet
rest
there
shelley
on
the
sill
for
though
the
winds
come
frorely
i
away
to
the
hill
and
the
ghost
of
sorley
the
cottage
here
in
turn
succeed
and
rule
carter
smith
and
village
fool
then
again
the
place
is
known
as
tavern
shop
and
now
somehow
it
come
to
me
to
light
the
fire
and
hold
the
key
here
in
heaven
to
reign
alone
all
the
walls
are
white
with
lime
big
blue
periwinkles
climb
and
kiss
the
crumbling
snug
inside
i
sit
and
rhyme
planning
poem
book
or
fable
at
my
darling
table
fresh
with
bluebells
from
the
hill
through
the
window
i
can
see
rooks
above
the
sparrows
in
the
violet
bed
and
and
old
red
bracken
smoulders
still
among
boulders
on
the
hill
far
too
bright
to
seem
quite
dead
but
old
death
who
ca
forget
waits
his
time
and
watches
yet
waits
and
watches
by
the
door
look
he
got
a
great
new
net
and
when
my
fighting
starts
afresh
stouter
cord
and
smaller
mesh
wo
be
cheated
as
before
nor
can
kindliness
of
spring
flowers
that
smile
nor
birds
that
sing
nor
butterfly
nor
grassy
hill
nor
anything
of
magic
keep
me
safe
to
rhyme
in
this
heaven
beyond
my
time
no
for
death
is
waiting
by
the
last
post
the
bugler
sent
a
call
of
high
romance
lights
out
lights
out
to
the
deserted
square
on
the
thin
brazen
notes
he
threw
a
prayer
god
if
it
for
me
next
time
in
france
o
spare
the
phantom
bugle
as
i
lie
dead
in
the
gas
and
smoke
and
roar
of
guns
dead
in
a
row
with
the
other
broken
ones
lying
so
stiff
and
still
under
the
sky
jolly
young
fusiliers
too
good
to
die
when
i
killed
when
i
killed
do
think
of
me
buried
there
in
cambrin
wood
nor
as
in
zion
think
of
me
with
the
intolerable
good
and
there
one
thing
that
i
know
well
i
damned
if
i
be
damned
to
hell
so
when
i
killed
do
wait
for
me
walking
the
dim
corridor
in
heaven
or
hell
do
wait
for
me
or
you
must
wait
for
evermore
you
find
me
buried
in
these
verses
that
you
read
so
when
i
killed
do
mourn
for
me
shot
poor
lad
so
bold
and
young
killed
and
gone
do
mourn
for
me
on
your
lips
my
life
is
hung
o
friends
and
lovers
you
can
save
your
playfellow
from
the
grave
letter
to
from
mametz
wood
i
never
dreamed
we
meet
that
day
in
our
old
haunts
down
fricourt
way
plotting
such
marvellous
journeys
there
for
jolly
old
well
when
it
over
first
we
meet
at
gweithdy
bach
my
country
seat
in
wales
a
curious
little
shop
with
two
rooms
and
a
roof
on
top
a
sort
of
billet
that
never
needs
a
crowd
to
fill
it
but
oh
the
country
round
about
the
sort
of
view
that
makes
you
shout
for
want
of
any
better
way
of
praising
god
there
a
blue
bay
shining
in
front
and
on
the
right
snowden
and
hebog
capped
with
white
and
lots
of
other
jolly
peaks
that
you
could
wonder
at
for
weeks
with
jag
and
spur
and
hump
and
cleft
there
a
grey
castle
on
the
left
and
back
in
the
high
hinterland
you
see
the
grave
of
shawn
knarlbrand
who
slew
the
savage
buffaloon
by
the
one
night
in
june
and
won
his
surname
from
the
horn
of
this
prodigious
unicorn
beyond
where
the
two
rhinogs
tower
rhinog
fach
and
rhinog
fawr
close
there
after
a
four
years
chase
from
thessaly
and
the
woods
of
thrace
the
beaten
stood
at
bay
and
growled
and
fought
and
passed
away
you
see
where
mountain
conies
grapple
with
prayer
and
creed
in
their
rock
chapel
which
ben
and
claire
once
built
for
them
they
call
it
söar
bethlehem
you
see
where
in
old
roman
days
before
revivals
changed
our
ways
the
virgin
the
devil
grab
printing
her
foot
on
a
stone
slab
with
five
clear
and
you
find
the
fiendish
thumbprint
close
behind
you
see
where
math
mathonwy
son
spoke
with
the
wizard
gwydion
and
bad
him
from
south
wales
set
out
to
steal
that
creature
with
the
snout
that
grunting
beast
divinely
flavoured
for
the
feast
no
traveller
yet
has
hit
upon
a
wilder
land
than
meirion
for
desolate
hills
and
tumbling
stones
bogland
and
melody
and
old
bones
fairies
and
ghosts
are
here
galore
and
poetry
most
splendid
more
than
can
be
written
with
the
pen
or
understood
by
common
men
in
gweithdy
bach
we
rest
awhile
we
dress
our
wounds
and
learn
to
smile
with
easier
lips
we
stretch
our
legs
and
live
on
bilberry
tart
and
eggs
and
store
up
solar
energy
basking
in
sunshine
by
the
sea
until
we
feel
a
match
once
more
for
but
another
war
so
then
we
kiss
our
families
and
sail
across
the
seas
the
god
of
song
protecting
us
to
the
great
hills
of
caucasus
robert
will
learn
the
local
for
billeting
and
things
like
that
if
siegfried
learns
the
piccolo
to
charm
the
people
as
we
go
the
jolly
peasants
clad
in
furs
will
greet
the
officers
with
open
arms
and
ere
we
pass
will
make
us
vocal
with
kavasse
in
old
bagdad
we
call
a
halt
at
the
sâshuns
ancestral
vault
we
catch
the
persian
scent
and
understand
what
omar
meant
bitlis
and
mush
will
know
our
faces
tiflis
and
tomsk
and
all
such
places
perhaps
eventually
we
get
among
the
tartars
of
thibet
hobnobbing
with
the
chungs
and
mings
and
doing
wild
tremendous
things
in
free
adventure
quest
and
fight
and
god
what
poetry
we
write
a
dead
boche
to
you
who
read
my
songs
of
war
and
only
hear
of
blood
and
fame
i
say
you
heard
it
said
before
war
hell
and
if
you
doubt
the
same
today
i
found
in
mametz
wood
a
certain
cure
for
lust
of
blood
where
propped
against
a
shattered
trunk
in
a
great
mess
of
things
unclean
sat
a
dead
boche
he
scowled
and
stunk
with
clothes
and
face
a
sodden
green
spectacled
dribbling
black
blood
from
nose
and
beard
faun
here
down
this
very
way
here
only
yesterday
king
faun
went
leaping
he
sang
with
careless
shout
hurling
his
name
about
he
sang
with
oaken
stock
his
steps
from
rock
to
rock
in
safety
keeping
here
faun
is
free
here
faun
is
free
today
against
yon
pine
forlorn
yet
still
divine
king
faun
leant
weeping
they
drank
my
holy
brook
my
strawberries
they
took
my
private
path
they
trod
loud
wept
the
desolate
god
scorn
on
scorn
heaping
faun
what
is
he
faun
what
is
he
the
spoilsport
my
familiar
ghost
again
comes
to
see
what
he
can
see
critic
son
of
conscious
brain
spying
on
our
privacy
slam
the
window
bolt
the
door
yet
he
enter
in
and
stay
in
tomorrow
book
he
score
indiscretions
of
today
whispered
love
and
muttered
fears
how
their
echoes
fly
about
none
escape
his
watchful
ears
every
sigh
might
be
a
shout
no
kind
words
nor
angry
cries
turn
away
this
grim
spoilsport
no
fine
lady
pleading
eyes
neither
love
nor
hate
nor
port
critics
wears
no
smile
of
fun
speaks
no
word
of
blame
nor
praise
counts
our
kisses
one
by
one
notes
each
gesture
every
phrase
my
familiar
ghost
again
stands
or
squats
where
suits
him
best
critic
son
of
conscious

listens

takes
no
rest
the
shivering
beggar
near
clapham
village
where
fields
began
saint
edward
met
a
beggar
man
it
was
christmas
morning
the
church
bells
tolled
the
old
man
trembled
for
the
fierce
cold
saint
edward
cried
it
is
monstrous
sin
a
beggar
to
lie
in
rags
so
thin
an
old
and
the
frost
so
keen
i
shall
give
him
my
gaberdine
he
stripped
off
his
gaberdine
of
scarlet
and
wrapped
it
round
the
aged
varlet
who
clutched
at
the
folds
with
a
muttered
curse
quaking
and
chattering
seven
times
worse
said
edward
sir
it
would
seem
you
freeze
most
bitter
at
your
extremities
here
are
gloves
and
shoes
and
stockings
also
that
warm
upon
your
way
you
may
go
the
man
took
stocking
and
shoe
and
glove
blaspheming
christ
our
saviour
love
yet
seemed
to
find
but
little
relief
shaking
and
shivering
like
a
leaf
said
the
saint
again
i
have
no
great
riches
yet
take
this
tunic
take
these
breeches
my
shirt
and
my
vest
take
everything
and
give
due
thanks
to
jesus
the
king
the
saint
stood
naked
upon
the
snow
long
miles
from
where
he
was
lodged
at
bowe
praying
o
god
my
faith
it
grows
faint
this
would
try
the
temper
of
any
saint
make
clean
my
heart
almighty
i
pray
and
drive
these
sinful
thoughts
away
make
clean
my
heart
if
it
be
thy
will
this
damned
old
rascal
shivering
still
he
stooped
he
touched
the
beggar
man
shoulder
he
asked
him
did
the
frost
nip
colder
frost
said
the
beggar
no
stupid
lad
is
the
palsy
makes
me
shiver

forty

down
down

the

our

the

us

john

what
could
be
dafter
than
john
skelton
laughter
what
sound
more
tenderly
than
his
pretty
poetry
so
where
to
rank
old
skelton
he
was
no
monstrous
milton
nor
wrote
no
paradise
lost
so
wondered
at
by
most
phrased
so
disdainfully
composed
so
painfully
he
struck
what
milton
missed
milling
an
english
grist
with
homely
turn
and
twist
he
was
english
through
and
through
not
greek
nor
french
nor
jew
though
well
their
tongues
he
knew
the
living
and
the
dead
learned
erasmus
said
britannicarum
lumen
et
decus
but
oh
colin
clout
how
his
pen
flies
about
twiddling
and
turning
scorching
and
burning
thrusting
and
thrumming
how
it
hurries
with
humming
leaping
and
running
at
the
tunning
of
mistress
eleanor
rumming
how
for
poor
philip
sparrow
was
murdered
at
carow
how
our
hearts
he
does
harrow
jest
and
grief
mingle
in
this
for
he
will
not
stop
to
sweep
nor
mop
to
prune
nor
prop
to
cut
each
phrase
up
like
beef
when
we
sup

foreign

i
have
but
to
wish
and
that
is
enough
the
charms
are
vain
one
wish
is
enough
my
master
pledged
my
hand
to
a
wizard
transformed
would
i
be
to
toad
or
lizard
if
he
guessed
but
fiddlededee
for
a

hey
and
hither
my
lad
boy
most
venerable
and
learned
sir
tall
and
true
philosopher
these
rings
of
smoke
you
blow
all
day
with
such
deep
thought
what
sense
have
they
philosopher
small
friend
with
prayer
and
meditation
i
make
an
image
of
creation
and
if
your
mind
is
working
nimble
straightway
you
recognize
a
symbol
of
the
endless
and
eternal
ring
of
god
who
girdles
everything
god
who
in
his
own
form
and
plan
moulds
the
fugitive
life
of
man
these
vaporous
toys
you
watch
me
make
that
shoot
ahead
pause
turn
and
break
some
glide
far
out
like
sailing
ships
some
weak
ones
fail
me
at
my
lips
he
who
ringed
his
awe
in
smoke
when
he
led
forth
his
captive
folk
in
like
manner
east
west
north
and
south
blows
us
from
his
mouth
a
child
nightmare
through
long
nursery
nights
he
stood
by
my
bed
unwearying
loomed
gigantic
formless
queer
purring
in
my
haunted
ear
that
same
hideous
nightmare
thing
talking
as
he
lapped
my
blood
in
a
voice
cruel
and
flat
saying
for
ever
cat
cat
cat
that
one
word
was
all
he
said
that
one
word
through
all
my
sleep
in
monotonous
mock
despair
nonsense
may
be
light
as
air
but
there
nonsense
that
can
keep
horror
bristling
round
the
head
when
a
voice
cruel
and
flat
says
for
ever
cat
cat
cat
he
had
faded
he
was
gone
years
ago
with
nursery
land
when
he
leapt
on
me
again
from
the
clank
of
a
night
train
overpowered
me
foot
and
head
lapped
my
blood
while
on
and
on
the
old
voice
cruel
and
flat
says
for
ever
cat
cat
cat
morphia
drowsed
again
i
lay
in
a
crater
by
high
wood
he
was
there
with
straddling
legs
staring
eyes
as
big
as
eggs
purring
as
he
lapped
my
blood
his
black
bulk
darkening
the
day
with
a
voice
cruel
and
flat
cat
cat
cat
he
said
cat

when
i
shot
through
heart
and
head
and
there
no
choice
but
to
die
the
last
word
i
hear
no
doubt
wo
be
charge
or

nor
the

i
dead
an
hour
or
more
i
woke
when
i
already
passed
the
door
that
cerberus
guards
and
down
the
road
to
lethe
as
an
old
greek
signpost
showed
above
me
on
my
stretcher
swinging
by
i
saw
new
stars
in
the
subterrene
sky
a
cross
a
rose
in
bloom
a
cage
with
bars
and
a
barbed
arrow
feathered
in
fine
stars
i
felt
the
vapours
of
forgetfulness
float
in
my
nostrils
oh
may
heaven
bless
dear
lady
proserpine
who
saw
me
wake
and
stooping
over
me
for
henna
sake
cleared
my
poor
buzzing
head
and
sent
me
back
breathless
with
leaping
heart
along
the
track
after
me
roared
and
clattered
angry
hosts
of
demons
heroes
and
life
life
i
ca
be
dead
i
wo
be
dead
damned
if
i
die
for
any

i
said
cerberus
stands
and
grins
above
me
now
wearing
three
heads
lion
and
lynx
and
sow
quick
a
revolver
but
my
webley
gone
stolen
no
bombs
no
knife
the
crowd
swarms
on
bellows
hurls
stones
not
even
a
honeyed
sop
nothing
good
cerberus
good
dog
but
stop
stay
a
great
luminous
thought
i
do
believe
there
still
some
morphia
that
i
bought
on
leave
then
swiftly
cerberus
wide
mouths
i
cram
with
army
biscuit
smeared
with
ration
jam
and
sleep
lurks
in
the
luscious
plum
and
apple
he
crunches
swallows
stiffens
seems
to
grapple
with
the
poppy
then
a
snore
a
crash
the
beast
blocks
up
the
corridor
with
monstrous
hairy
carcase
red
and
dun
too
late
for
i
sped
through
o
life
o
sun
the
bough
of
nonsense
an
idyll
back
from
the
somme
two
fusiliers
limped
painfully
home
the
elder
said
robert
i
lived
three
thousand
years
this
summer
and
i
nine
parts
dead
but
if
that
truly
so
i
cried
quick
now
through
these
great
oaks
and
see
the
famous
bough
where
once
a
nonsense
built
her
nest
with
skulls
and
flowers
and
all
things
queer
in
an
old
boot
with
patient
breast
hatching
three
eggs
and
the
next
year
foaled
thirteen
squamous
young
beneath
and
rid
wales
of
drink
melancholy
and
psalms
she
did
said
he
before
this
quaint
mood
fails
we
sit
and
weave
a
nonsense
hymn
hanging
it
up
with
monkey
tails
in
a
deep
grove
all
hushed
and
dim
to
glorious
planted
in
dreams
by
pious
portuguese
which
men
are
wise
beyond
their
time
and
worship
nonsense
no
one
more
hard
by
among
old
quince
and
lime
they
built
a
temple
with
no
floor
and
whosoever
worships
in
that
place
he
disappears
from
sight
and
leaves
no
trace
once
the
galatians
built
a
fane
to
sense
what
duller
god
than
that
but
the
first
day
of
autumn
rain
the
roof
fell
in
and
crushed
them
flat
ay
for
a
roof
of
subtlest
logic
falls
when
nonsense
is
foundation
for
the
walls
i
tell
him
old
galatian
tales
he
caps
them
in
quick
portuguese
while
phantom
creatures
with
green
scales
scramble
and
roll
among
the
trees
the
hymn
swells
on
a
bough
above
us
sings
a
row
of
bright
pink
birds
flapping
their
wings
not
dead
walking
through
trees
to
cool
my
heat
and
pain
i
know
that
david
with
me
here
again
all
that
is
simple
happy
strong
he
is
caressingly
i
stroke
rough
hark
of
the
friendly
oak
a
brook
goes
bubbling
by
the
voice
is
his
turf
burns
with
pleasant
smoke
i
laugh
at
chaffinch
and
at
primroses
all
that
is
simple
happy
strong
he
is
over
the
whole
wood
in
a
little
while
breaks
his
slow
smile
a
boy
in
church
brethren
my
window
frames
forest
and
heather
i
hardly
hear
the
tuneful
babble
not
knowing
nor
much
caring
whether
the
text
is
praise
or
exhortation
prayer
or
thanksgiving
or
damnation
outside
it
blows
wetter
and
wetter
the
tossing
trees
never
stay
still
i
shift
my
elbows
to
catch
better
the
full
round
sweep
of
heathered
hill
the
tortured
copse
bends
to
and
fro
in
silence
like
a
the
parson
voice
runs
like
a
river
over
smooth
rocks
i
like
this
church
the
pews
are
staid
they
never
shiver
they
never
bend
or
sway
or
lurch
prayer
says
the
kind
voice
is
a
chain
that
draws
down
grace
from
heaven
again
i
add
the
hymns
up
over
and
over
until
there
not
the
least
mistake
look
there
a
plover
it
gone
who
that
saint
by
the
lake
the
red
light
from
his
mantle
passes
across
the
broad
memorial
brasses
it
pleasant
here
for
dreams
and
thinking
lolling
and
letting
reason
nod
with
ugly
serious
people
linking
sad
prayers
to
a
forgiving
god
but
a
dumb
blast
sets
the
trees
swaying
with
furious
zeal
like
madmen
praying
corporal
stare
back
from
the
line
one
night
in
june
i
gave
a
dinner
at
bethune
seven
courses
the
most
gorgeous
meal
money
could
buy
or
batman
steal
five
hungry
lads
welcomed
the
fish
with
shouts
that
nearly
cracked
the
dish
asparagus
came
with
tender
tops
strawberries
in
cream
and
mutton
chops
said
jenkins
as
my
hand
he
shook
they
put
this
in
the
history
book
we
bawled
church
anthems
of
bethlehem
and
hermon
snow
with
drinking
songs
a
jolly
sound
to
help
the
good
red
pommard
round
stories
and
laughter
interspersed
we
drowned
a
long
la
bassée
thirst
trenches
in
june
make
throats
damned
dry
then
through
the
window
suddenly
badge
stripes
and
medals
all
complete
we
saw
him
swagger
up
the
street
just
like
a
live
man
corporal
stare
stare
killed
last
may
at
festubert
caught
on
patrol
near
the
boche
wire
tom
horribly
by
fire
he
paused
saluted
smartly
grinned
then
passed
away
like
a
puff
of
wind
leaving
us
blank
astonishment
the
song
broke
up
we
started
leant
out
of
the
window
nothing
there
not
the
least
shadow
of
corporal
stare
only
a
quiver
of
smoke
that
showed
a
dropped
on
the
silent
road
the
assault
heroic
down
in
the
mud
i
lay
tired
out
by
my
long
day
of
five
damned
days
and
nights
five
sleepless
days
and
nights
and
set
me
where
the
dungeon
of
despair
looms
over
desolate
sea
frowning
and
threatening
me
with
aspect
high
and
steep
a
most
malignant
keep
my
foes
that
lay
within
shouted
and
made
a
din
hooted
and
grinned
and
cried
today
we
killed
your
pride
today
your
ardour
ends
we
murdered
all
your
friends
we
undermined
by
stealth
your
happiness
and
your
health
we
taken
away
your
hope
now
you
may
droop
and
mope
to
misery
and
to
death
but
with
my
spear
of
faith
stout
as
an
oaken
rafter
with
my
round
shield
of
laughter
with
my
sharp
sword
that
speaks
a
bitter
word
i
stood
beneath
the
wall
and
there
defied
them
all
the
stones
they
cast
i
caught
and
alchemized
with
thought
into
such
lumps
of
gold
as
dreaming
misers
hold
the
boiling
oil
they
threw
fell
in
a
shower
of
dew
refreshing
me
the
spears
flew
harmless
by
my
ears
struck
quivering
in
the
sod
there
like
the
prophet
rod
put
leaves
out
took
firm
root
and
bore
me
instant
fruit
my
foes
were
all
astounded
dumbstricken
and
confounded
gaping
in
a
long
row
they
dared
not
thrust
nor
throw
thus
then
i
climbed
a
steep
buttress
and
won
the
keep
and
laughed
and
proudly
blew
my
horn
stand
to
stand
to
wake
up
sir
here
a
new
attack
stand
to
stand
to
the
poet
in
the
nursery
the
youngest
poet
down
the
shelves
was
fumbling
in
a
dim
library
just
behind
the
chair
from
which
the
ancient
poet
was
a
song
about
some
lovers
at
a
fair
pulling
his
long
white
beard
and
gently
grumbling
that
rhymes
were
beastly
things
and
never
there
and
as
i
groped
the
whole
time
i
was
thinking
about
the
tragic
poem
i
been
writing
an
old
man
life
of
beer
and
whisky
drinking
his
years
of
kidnapping
and
wicked
fighting
and
how
at
last
into
a
fever
sinking
remorsefully
he
died
his
bedclothes
biting
but
suddenly
i
saw
the
bright
green
cover
of
a
thin
pretty
book
right
down
below
i
snatched
it
up
and
turned
the
pages
over
to
find
it
full
of
poetry
and
so
put
it
down
my
neck
with
quick
hands
like
a
lover
and
turned
to
watch
if
the
old
man
saw
it
go
the
book
was
full
of
funny
muddling
mazes
each
rounded
off
into
a
lovely
song
and
most
extraordinary
and
monstrous
phrases
knotted
with
rhymes
like
a
thong
and
metre
twisting
like
a
chain
of
daisies
with
great
big
splendid
words
a
sentence
long
i
took
the
book
to
bed
with
me
and
gloated
learning
the
lines
that
seemed
to
sound
most
grand
so
soon
the
pretty
emerald
green
was
coated
with
jam
and
greasy
marks
from
my
hot
hand
while
round
the
nursery
for
long
months
there
floated
wonderful
words
no
one
could
understand
in
the
wilderness
christ
of
his
gentleness
thirsting
and
hungering
walked
in
the
wilderness
soft
words
of
grace
he
spoke
unto
lost
that
listened
wondering
he
heard
the
bitterns
call
from
ruined
answered
them
brotherly
he
held
communion
with
the
of
lonely
piety
basilisk
cockatrice
flocked
to
his
homilies
with
mail
of
dread
device
with
monstrous
barbéd
slings
with
eager
great
rats
on
leather
wings
and
poor
blind
broken
things
foul
in
their
miseries
and
ever
with
him
went
of
all
his
wanderings
comrade
with
ragged
coat
gaunt
ribs
poor
innocent
bleeding
foot
burning
throat
the
guileless
old
scapegoat
for
forty
nights
and
days
followed
in
jesus
ways
sure
guard
behind
him
kept
tears
like
a
lover
wept
cherries
of
the
night
are
riper
than
the
cherries
pluckt
at
noon
gather
to
your
fairy
piper
when
he
pipes
his
magic
tune
merry
merry
take
a
cherry
mine
are
sounder
mine
are
rounder
mine
are
sweeter
for
the
eater
under
the
moon
and
you
be
fairies
soon
in
the
cherry
pluckt
at
night
with
the
dew
of
summer
swelling
there
a
juice
of
pure
delight
cool
dark
sweet
divinely
smelling
merry
merry
take
a
cherry
mine
are
sounder
mine
are
rounder
mine
are
sweeter
for
the
eater
in
the
moonlight
and
you
be
fairies
quite
when
i
sound
the
fairy
call
gather
here
in
silent
meeting
chin
to
knee
on
the
orchard
wall
cooled
with
dew
and
cherries
eating
merry
merry
take
a
cherry
mine
are
sounder
mine
are
rounder
mine
are
sweeter
for
the
eater
when
the
dews
fall
and
you
be
fairies
all
i
watched
the
seasons
passing
slow
so
slow
in
the
fields
between
la
bassée
and
bethune
primroses
and
the
first
warm
day
of
spring
red
poppy
floods
of
june
august
and
yellowing
autumn
so
to
winter
nights
in
mud
or
snow
and
you
been
everything
dear
you
been
everything
that
i
most
lack
in
these
trenches
pictures
books
music
the
quiet
of
an
english
wood
beautiful
the
narrow
bouldered
the
broad
ocean
green
and
black
and
peace
and
all
that
good
free
verse
i
now
delight
in
spite
of
the
might
and
the
right
of
classic
tradition
in
writing
and
reciting
straight
ahead
without
let
or
omission
just
any
little
rhyme
in
any
little
time
that
runs
in
my
head
because
i
said
my
rhymes
no
longer
shall
stand
arrayed
like
prussian
soldiers
on
parade
that
march
stiff
as
starch
foot
to
foot
boot
to
boot
blade
to
blade
button
to
button
cheeks
and
chops
and
chins
like
mutton
no
no
my
rhymes
must
go
turn
twist
twinkling
frosty
misty
rhymes
i
will
make
like
keats
and
blake
and
christina
rossetti
with
run
and
ripple
and
shake
how
pretty
to
take
a
merry
little
rhyme
in
a
jolly
little
time
and
poke
it
and
choke
it
change
it
arrange
it
it
deface
it
pleat
it
with
pleats
sheet
it
with
sheets
of
empty
conceits
and
chop
and
chew
and
hack
and
hew
and
weld
it
into
a
uniform
stanza
and
evolve
a
neat
complacent
complete
academic
extravaganza
