one

his
lady
of

i
my
soul
awoke
from
slumber
the
long
ease
of
years
that
passed
away
in
dull
content
not
caring
what
the
world
deep
voices
meant
sunk
in
my
dreams
i
heard
their
harmonies
like
clamour
of
seas
that
told
of
ithaca
to
sailors
spent
with
trouble
and
forgetful
at
the
scent
and
taste
of
fruit
plucked
from
the
lotus
trees
for
as
i
slept
your
footsteps
on
the
grass
your
voice
wrought
once
again
the
miracle
of
eden
and
i
saw
appear
and
pass
eve
in
her
beauty
binding
still
the
spell
that
adam
felt
when
from
his
opened
side
stepped
woman
forth
in
loveliness
and
pride
ii
i
meet
you
in
the
mystery
of
the
night
a
dear
on
a
crescent
moon
an
opalescent
splendour
like
a
noon
of
lilies
and
i
wonder
that
the
height
should
darken
for
the
depth
to
give
me
light
light
of
your
face
so
lovely
that
i
swoon
with
gazing
and
then
wake
to
find
how
soon
joy
of
the
world
fades
when
you
fade
from
sight
beholding
you
i
am
endymion
lost
and
immortal
in
latmian
dreams
with
dian
bending
down
to
look
upon
her
shepherd
whose
æonian
slumber
seems
a
moment
twinkling
like
a
starry
gem
among
the
jewels
of
her
diadem
iii
if
i
could
tell
why
when
you
look
at
me
dreams
that
have
visited
half
wakeful
nights
and
shape
themselves
and
fill
one
far
valley
to
a
purple
sea
and
cities
rise
with
porphyry
jacinth
and
sapphire
gates
beneath
the
heights
within
the
dawn
where
ph
oe
bus
smites
earth
with
his
heel
claiming
its
lord
to
be
then
would
you
know
what
my
heart
seeks
to
say
and
falters
ere
sufficient
words
be
found
how
all
the
voiceless
night
and
vocal
day
love
looks
on
you
and
trembles
into
sound
love
longs
and
pleads
for
his
one
moment
bliss
you
and
him
mingled
in
a
silent
kiss
iv
my
love
is
like
a
spring
among
the
hills
whose
brimming
waters
may
not
be
confined
but
pour
one
torrent
through
the
ways
that
wind
down
to
a
garden
there
the
rose
distills
its
nectar
there
a
tall
white
lily
fills
night
with
anointing
of
two
lovers
blind
dumb
deaf
of
body
spirit
and
of
mind
from
breathless
blending
of
wills
long
ere
my
love
had
reached
you
hard
i
strove
to
send
its
torrent
through
the
barren
fields
i
wanted
you
the
lilied
of
innocence
whose
dear
possession
yields
immortal
gladness
to
my
heart
that
knows
how
you
surpass
the
lily
and
the
rose
v
like
one
great
opal
on
the
breast
of
night
soft
and
translucent
hangs
the
orb
of
june
i
hear
wild
pipings
of
a
joyous
tune
played
on
a
golden
reed
for
the
delight
of
you
my
hidden
lovely
eremite
you
by
the
fountain
from
the
marble
hewn
you
silent
as
in
dream
with
flowers
strewn
about
your
feet
you
goddess
robed
in
white
mute
and
amazed
i
at
the
broken
wall
lean
fearful
lest
the
sudden
dreadful
dawn
for
me
diana
awful
doom
let
fall
and
i
be
cursed
with
curious
action
save
that
you
find
in
me
this
strong
defence
my
adoration
of
your
innocence
vi
when
from
the
of
creation
grew
god
patient
waiting
in
your
eyes
the
morning
stars
and
all
the
host
that
flies
on
wings
of
love
paused
at
the
wondrous
blue
with
which
the
master
mindful
of
the
hue
stained
first
the
crystal
dome
of
summer
skies
and
afterward
the
violet
that
vies
with
amethyst
before
he
fashioned
you
and
i
have
trembled
with
those
ancient
stars
my
heart
has
known
the
seraphs
song
for
no
indifferent
dreamy
eyelid
bars
me
from
the
blue
nor
veils
with
lashes
long
your
love
that
to
my
tender
gazing
grows
bold
to
confess
it
i
am
glad
he
knows
vii
there
came
three
wise
men
riding
from
the
east
one
was
a
king
and
brought
a
gift
of
gold
and
one
bore
frankincense
that
fate
foretold
while
myrrh
was
offered
by
a
mitred
priest
nor
ever
hath
love
brave
adventure
ceased
since
that
fair
night
ashine
with
stars
and
cold
when
even
angels
paused
their
wings
to
fold
love
to
adore
made
one
with
man
and
beast
accept
three
gifts
i
to
thee
gladly
bring
each
hath
its
own
divine
significance
gold
is
the
body
thou
hast
crowned
a
king
my
spirit
is
the
prophet
frankincense
myrrh
is
the
mind
which
strives
to
tell
thee
all
love
mystic
and
melodious
ritual
viii
sometimes
i
think
that
we
have
lived
before
and
found
sweet
interest
down
the
centuries
in
all
life
little
things
that
charm
and
please
that
we
have
toiled
together
at
the
oar
in
one
of
cæsar
galleys
that
we
bore
one
burden
on
our
backs
and
bowed
the
knees
of
servitude
to
charlemagne
and
these
have
taught
us
how
to
love
for
evermore
dear
comrade
we
have
often
changed
our
state
we
have
been
slaves
and
masters
serfs
and
kings
you
have
been
man
i
woman
wont
to
wait
upon
my
lover
word
rememberings
are
in
the
mystic
rapture
that
we
feel
whenever
at
your
feet
a
while
i
kneel
ix
two
faces
haunt
the
stillnesses
of
sleep
the
first
is
of
a
woman
i
have
known
past
years
in
many
lives
as
on
a
throne
within
my
heart
for
whom
i
daily
keep
fast
and
high
vigil
while
deep
calls
to
deep
you
also
stir
me
like
blown
through
woodland
hollows
where
i
walk
alone
when
twilight
and
its
shadows
slowly
creep
and
i
am
torn
love
of
you
and
her
my
dear
of
some
long
ago
till
past
and
present
pausing
to
confer
determine
what
i
hardly
dare
to
know
the
faces
i
have
loved
and
love
are
one
how
you
have
followed
me
from
sun
to
sun
x
last
night
i
crossed
the
spaces
to
your
side
as
you
lay
sleeping
in
the
sacred
room
of
our
great
moment
like
a
lily
bloom
fragile
and
white
were
you
my
for
pain
and
loneliness
with
you
abide
and
death
had
thought
to
touch
you
with
his
doom
until
love
stood
angelic
at
the
tomb
drew
sword
smote
him
and
life
door
opened
wide
i
looked
on
you
and
breathed
upon
your
hair
your
hair
of
such
soft
brown
translucent
gold
nor
did
you
know
that
i
knelt
down
in
prayer
clasped
hands
and
worshipped
you
for
the
untold
magnificence
of
womanhood
divine
god
miracle
of
water
turned
to
wine
xi
paola
and
francesca
dead
these
years
and
lost
forever
unto
rimini
lanciotto
garden
blooms
no
more
where
ye
found
love
is
laughter
love
is
also
tears
is
peace
and
pain
high
hopes
and
sudden
fears
that
love
is
gain
and
loss
an
ecstasy
of
heaven
and
then
hell
hot
eternity
a
balm
that
soothes
the
soul
a
flame
that
sears
i
too
know
of
a
secret
garden
where
pale
asphodels
are
rivals
of
the
rose
and
all
life
opposites
are
gathered
there
before
the
spirit
agony
that
knows
gladness
ineffable
through
loving
one
who
hath
no
equal
underneath
the
sun
xii
what
has
become
of
our
great
moment
when
the
love
we
veiled
was
daringly
revealed
you
in
my
arms
o
heart
and
one
kiss
sealed
the
covenant
i
who
among
all
men
was
weakest
gained
forthwith
the
strength
of
ten
and
you
for
my
sake
instantly
repealed
your
prayer
for
death
that
you
might
live
and
yield
me
title
to
possess
your
spirit
ken
we
may
not
ever
that
dear
bliss
renew
but
what
we
found
has
entered
into
me
a
change
of
motive
and
a
fairer
view
as
though
god
whispered
henceforth
thou
shalt
be
strong
to
fulfil
thy
soul
rise
up
and
make
paths
and
a
song
in
deserts
for
her
sake
xiii
what
barriers
are
these
that
bid
me
stand
baffled
amazed
and
wrathful
at
the
sign
that
threatens
me
for
claiming
what
is
mine
have
we
not
walked
together
hand
in
hand
down
lanes
of
devon
mused
upon
the
sand
beside
the
bay
of
naples
drunk
the
wine
of
famed
fiesole
where
shelley
line
thundered
of
freedom
for
italia
land
tradition
built
this
guarded
and
shelley
song
hath
strength
to
sing
it
down
come
brave
the
craven
face
funereal
of
pharisees
who
weave
of
thorns
a
crown
for
him
who
has
not
faltered
at
the
cross
but
counts
that
gain
which
others
reckon
loss
xiv
there
needs
must
be
misunderstandings
dear
for
love
is
more
than
the
word
transcends
it
as
the
of
a
bird
is
distanced
by
the
sun
let
fall
the
fear
let
joy
and
constant
certainty
appear
armed
with
angelic
swords
of
flame
that
gird
their
thighs
for
though
the
day
with
rain
is
blurred
hark
to
the
singing
legions
of
the
year
always
i
find
gain
in
lamented
loss
some
treasure
in
the
beaten
path
i
tread
and
that
alone
survives
which
bears
a
cross
branded
by
some
hot
trial
that
is
dead
last
night
as
i
was
weeping
someone
cried
love
can
not
live
save
love
be
crucified
xv
who
is
to
blame
that
suddenly
there
fell
suspicion
like
a
shadow
on
our
souls
love
who
was
once
supreme
no
more
controls
the
harmonies
hark
can
you
hear
the
bell
across
the
valley
of
our
tears
that
swell
the
brook
called
cedron
is
a
flood
that
rolls
between
us
while
doubt
in
his
tower
tolls
love
loss
in
our
dear
shattered
miracle
was
it
a
word
that
somehow
clouded
thought
was
it
a
flaw
in
substance
of
myself
that
proved
two
tendencies
within
me
wrought
plantagenet
commingled
with
the
guelph
ah
love
if
so
have
patience
and
behold
how
god
blends
his
base
metals
with
the
gold
xvi
all
night
my
soul
groped
blindly
in
a
dream
through
mazes
of
a
mighty
corridor
pillared
between
the
stars
and
my
heart
bore
its
youthful
sorrow
calling
for
the
gleam
shed
from
your
golden
body
like
a
beam
sent
from
the
sun
a
beauty
nevermore
mine
to
behold
to
have
to
cherish
for
faith
rule
was
ended
and
doubt
stood
supreme
all
night
my
soul
groped
blindly
till
the
dawn
woke
on
the
world
with
matin
song
of
birds
and
choral
thunder
of
the
wind
upon
the
mountains
while
the
trees
chanted
the
words
of
an
old
litany
that
cried
the
grief
of
lovers
sundered
through
their
lost
belief
xvii
dear
love
is
fallen
fallen
by
my
hand
lost
is
my
eden
closed
its
golden
gate
winged
seraphim
guarding
the
ways
await
with
swords
of
sudden
flame
me
to
withstand
i
am
that
uncrowned
king
at
whose
command
earth
and
the
sky
obeyed
things
small
and
great
bowed
down
to
serve
oh
terrible
the
fate
of
adam
lonely
in
an
alien
land
henceforth
in
bitterness
i
shall
eat
bread
cursed
for
my
sake
the
fields
which
day
adorns
no
more
with
fruitage
of
the
autumn
spread
shall
bear
me
briars
and
abundant
thorns
my
glory
too
shall
know
the
moth
and
rust
come
quickly
death
and
be
it
dust
to
dust
xviii
and
i
have
lost
you
so
the
voices
say
voices
that
taunt
deride
my
silent
pain
voices
that
fall
incessant
like
the
rain
throughout
this
dim
and
day
dear
love
come
back
resume
your
ancient
sway
for
my
strong
pleading
or
is
it
in
vain
that
i
beneath
the
stars
all
night
have
lain
prone
upon
earth
clay
crying
unto
clay
no
answer
o
thou
sky
thunder
upon
my
head
the
riving
flame
there
is
no
more
for
me
to
do
but
die
or
else
for
one
whom
now
i
dare
not
name
at
crossroads
of
the
world
a
watch
to
keep
with
those
who
thither
come
a
while
to
weep
xix
last
night
or
was
it
in
the
golden
morn
once
more
i
dreamed
that
i
alone
did
fare
forth
into
and
there
i
found
you
not
my
star
was
set
forlorn
i
sought
the
kindred
company
of
worn
and
stricken
souls
lost
sundered
souls
who
bear
old
and
avoided
crosses
with
each
care
woven
together
in
their
crowns
of
thorn
gods
of
the
patient
vain
endeavour
these
claimed
me
and
called
me
fellow
comrade
friend
and
bade
me
join
in
their
brave
litanies
because
though
i
had
failed
you
i
dared
bend
before
you
without
hope
of
one
reward
save
that
in
loving
you
my
soul
still
soared
xx
when
singing
first
my
smitten
heart
lament
my
thought
was
only
turned
upon
my
pain
and
i
was
also
querulous
with
cain
crying
this
thing
that
thou
on
me
hast
sent
is
more
than
i
can
bear
but
now
content
peace
and
a
quiet
joy
close
the
refrain
of
passionate
protesting
with
a
strain
of
dulcimers
and
silver
trumpets
blent
for
though
my
shame
be
branded
on
my
brow
and
you
in
tears
have
driven
me
afar
because
i
faltered
and
forgot
my
vow
the
night
has
still
for
me
a
single
star
that
will
not
let
me
quite
forget
your
eyes
you
and
the
dear
of
paradise
xxi
since
we
have
sundered

by
broken
vow

fault

through
what
dark
centuries
have
all
your
kind
upon
the
cross
of
sex
been
crucified
betrayed
with
kisses
smitten
then
denied
mocked
in
the
place
of
judgment
and
made
blind
to
please
the
ruling
of
some
priestly
mind
along
the
cobbled
highroad
straight
and
wide
they
have
gone
bleeding
stumbling
forth
and
died

man

now
thy

leaps
and

upon

thy
freedom
for
thy
sorrow

all
that
thou

i

tragic
figure
of

from

the
wild
high
hills
of
sorrow
where
the
piled
in
drift
of
tears
lo
with
what
tender
grace
joy
holds
the
world
again
in
her
embrace
since
you
came
forth
and
looked
on
me
and
smiled
down
in
the
valley
shines
a
scimiter
a
stream
with
deep
damascened
and
of
the
bards
of
day
one
loiterer
still
lingers
at
his
song
securely
screened
by
foliage
dear
what
miracle
is
this
transforming
void
and
chaos
with
a
kiss
xxv
there
are
so
many
things
to
say
and
do
after
that
moment
of
our
breathless
bliss
when
separation
ends
upon
a
kiss
and
i
have
passed
the
dreary
spaces
through
words
as
of
one
long
leashed
by
silence
who
finds
tongue
at
last
and
eager
would
not
miss
fulfilment
of
ten
thousand
fancies
this
must
follow
my
first
swift
embrace
of
you
secure
within
the
palaces
of
thought
and
guarded
by
my
soul
as
with
a
sword
these
fancies
are
no
curious
eyes
have
caught
their
gleam
and
glory
you
alone
adored
may
enter
the
uplifted
gates
of
gold
to
hear
and
see
what
never
has
been
told
xxvi
there
is
a
little
path
among
the
trees
that
leads
me
to
a
quiet
thither
i
go
for
the
content
of
thought
dreams
and
the
quiet
joy
of
reveries
and
in
this
place
my
simple
melodies
are
sung
with
you
beside
me
fancies
caught
from
the
swift
moment
as
if
one
forgot
the
truth
that
cries
imaginings
are
these
so
have
i
with
the
magic
of
the
mind
called
and
compelled
you
to
my
lonely
heart
and
never
have
you
failed
me
now
i
find
no
more
the
anguish
of
dead
days
apart
from
you
i
faltered
at
your
side
i
gain
gladness
from
sorrow
and
peace
out
of
pain
xxvii
come
down
the
woodland
way
a
while
with
me
be
still
and
know
the
spirit
of
this
place
that
is
my
garden
how
each
flower
face
turns
to
us
the
serried
rosemary
which
guard
my
lilies
from
captivity
what
slow
unfolding
of
the
harebell
grace
what
quiet
moving
of
majestic
pace
in
the
persistence
of
the
shrub
and
tree
made
one
with
nature
you
my
love

i
are
reconciled
for

us

heard
a
presence
in
the
garden
cry
delve
earth
smite
rock
plunge
pool
and
cleave
the
wood
there
thou
shalt
find
me

have
found
peace

days
when
in

no

had
found
a
place
and
i
was
saul
named
for
the

a

how
swiftly
age
turns
back
the
gate
of
time
and
with
what
eager
pace
pursues
the
path
trod
by
the
feet
of
childhood
i
can
see
the
phenician
ships
triremes
down
from

fruitage
of
the

and

tall
bacchic
amphora

bales
of

stand
along

hear
the

their

the
strange
brown
mariners
of
many
seas
with
arms
like
in
their
strength
oh
then
was
i
a
wanderer
of
earth
and
dreamed
of
brave
adventure
in
far
lands
they
say
the
hebrew
burning
in
my
blood
closed
all
life
doors
save
one
upon

that
i
the

of

contemned

delivered
oft
in

me
back
to

who
on

flee
from
this
wicked

ordained
to

the
wrath

how
all

gone
from

in

song
behold
the

thereof
goes
forth
unto
the
ends

neither

not

in

boyhood
days

my
young
athenian
whose

for

breathes

on

not

learned

is
the
progression
of
a

him
hard
strove
i
through
the
barriers
of

and
one
by
one
dissolved
the
old
ideas
that
misted
the

i
found

all

beautiful
like

it

the

to

in

hast
plunged
me
an
infinite
pain
harries
me
on
to
its
lowest
abyss
beats
on
my
head
in
a
torment
of
rain
shapes
that
are
dreadful
with
uttermost
hate
follow
me
down
and
a
voice
follows
after
stay
thou
dost
flee
from
the
furies
of
fate
hell
trembles
with
their
demoniac
laughter
why
didst
thou
form
me
so
helpless
and
frail
out
of
the
clod
and
allied
to
the
star
lured
by
the
vision
and
fashioned
to
fail
is
it
my
fault
i
have
fallen
so
far
why
in
my
breast
didst
thou
kindle
desire
love
for
the
lips
of
a
woman
divine
why
did
i
swoon
at
the
sound
of
the
lyre
dance
and
grow
wild
in
the
wonder
of
wine
god
how
i
hate
thee
enthroned
in
the
sky
cruel
omnipotence
torturing
me
clenched
are
these
manacled
hands
that
defy
hosts
of
the
seraphim
singing
to
thee
paused
one
a
moment
and
played
on
a
harp
joyous
and
free
in
the
quest
of
his
star
passed
and
was
gone
in
despair
of
the
sharp
pain
that
smote
me
like
a
swift
scimetar
pain
that
was
memory
stirred
by
his
song
breath
of
the
lily
and
breath
of
the
rose
myrrh
on
the
fingers
of
maidens
that
throng
home
from
the
pools
when
the
day
is
at
close
hark
how
they
sing
as
they
carry
the
jars
high
on
the
shoulder
home
home
from
the
well
gold
on
the
dates
is
the
kiss
of
the
stars
soft
as
the
kiss
of
betrothal
that
fell
sweet
on
the
lips
when
my
lover
claimed
me
caught
in
the
vineyard
delayed
by
the
moon
orbed
in
the
west
which
i
tarried
to
see
night
hath
a
charm
that
is
not
in
the
noon
flight
of
the
seraph
thou
bringest
me
this
love
and
the
laughter
of
maidens
who
tell
life
is
revealed
in
the
breath
of
a
kiss
softly
they
sing
it
home
home
from
the
well
flight
of
the
seraph
delay
oh
delay
spread
wide
those
pinions
of
purple
and
gold
strike
on
the
strings
o
my
harpist
and
play
sing
me
that
song
that
they
anthemed
of
old
when
from
the
dust
all
my
members
were
made
when
the
cradle
a
mother
looked
down
saw
me
her
and
clasped
me
and
prayed
god
to
bequeath
me
a
sceptre
and
crown
sing
till
jehovah
is
shamed
by
that
prayer
false
to
the
covenant
sealed
by
her
pain
he
who
hath
damned
what
she
suckled
with
care
sing
back
the
years
and
her
love
is
again
gone
is
the
seraph
o
god
and
o
god
thou
only
art
left
thou
only
and
i
wouldst
have
my
pity
i
who
am
a
clod
give
that
much
torturer
throned
in
the
sky
man
is
unconquered
jehovah
hath
failed
love
and
not
hate
is
the
end
of
the
law
lonely
is
he
and
his
heart
is
assailed
by
the
swift
arrow
he
ventured
to
draw
head
to
the
bow
and
the
haft
to
the
cord
arrow
called
judgment
and
rod
of
his
might
barbed
with
the
vengeance
and
wrath
of
the
lord
winged
with
the
flame
of
an
infinite
right
yea
thou
hast
pity
and
man
will
forgive
man
will
forgive
and
thine
anger
forget
man
who
hath
learned
in
the
dying
to
live
open
the
books
for
the
judgment
is
set
was
i
to
blame
that
lazarus
lurked
loathsome
with
sores
at
the
banqueting
hall
vile
in
return
for
the
labour
he
shirked
begging
for
crumbs
when
the
world
was
his
all
the
race
to
the
swift
the
proverb
hath
said
i
strove
and
won
to
the
goal
got
me
a
palace
anointed
my
head
unctioned
my
body
and
pleasured
my
soul
pleasured
my
soul
that
is
tortured
in
hell
unctioned
my
body
that
crumbles
to
dust
got
me
a
palace
whose
pinnacles
fell
gone
are
the
garments
to
moth
and
to
rust
dim
are
the
depths
of
the
gulf
of
my
pain
memory
burns
the
fine
linen
the
feast
beautiful
faces
of
souls
i
have
slain
blood
of
the
threatening
prophet
and
priest
lazarus
thou
like
a
dream
in
the
night
ere
one
awaketh
to
find
that
the
day
leaps
on
the
hills
in
the
joy
of
his
might
sings
till
the
shadows
are
driven
away
lazarus
thou
like
a
god
in
his
star
speeding
through
space
and
whose
chariot
wheels
thunder
on
pavements
of
crystal
and
jar
hell
deep
foundations
my
spirit
appeals
clamours
and
cries
in
protest
of
its
pain
rages
and
rails
at
the
wreck
and
the
wrong
done
by
jehovah
revenge
is
in
vain
hate
hurls
at
hate
with
a
hate
that
is
strong
lazarus
why
art
thou
come
unto
me
stand
like
a
star
on
a
mountain
of
morn
spirit
redeemed
by
jehovah
decree
and
drink
to
the
dregs
of
my
chalice
of
scorn
bitter
the
chalice
of
dives
disgrace
shudderest
thou
at
the
purple
stained
brim
drink
or
i
dash
the
cup
full
in
thy
face
drink
and
then
back
to
hosannah
and
hymn
fade
from
my
sight
and
thy
glory
withdraw
over
the
gulf
to
dim
islands
of
palm
where
the
redeemed
by
the
blood
of
the
law
sing
to
the
lord
on
their
harps
with
a
psalm
taunt
me
not
lazarus
thou
and
thy
smile
pity
or
scorn
i
regard
not
away
is
paradise
lonely
that
thou
must
beguile
hell
with
thy
holiness
what
does
thou
say
nay
thou
are
silent
why
wilt
thou
not
speak
this
is
the
torment
that
never
a
word
touch
of
a
hand
or
of
lips
on
my
cheek
cloud
of
gehenna
hath
stirred
think
of
it
lazarus
thou
wast
alone
down
by
the
gate
of
my
palace
didst
call
give
of
thy
bread
and
i
gave
thee
a
stone
lazarus
lazarus
i
would
give
all
i
would
give
all
for
i
know
thou
didst
crave
love
only
love
who
had
no
one
to
love
even
as
i
who
have
learned
in
the
grave
what
i
had
missed
in
the
above
life
is
in
loving
and
lonely
is
he
who
hath
not
found
in
the
flower
and
fern
song
of
the
bird
and
the
hum
of
the
bee
voice
and
a
prayer
as
of
spirits
that
yearn
upward
forever
to
fellowship
strive
bravely
for
place
in
the
legions
of
light
dauntless
of
death
in
the
tempest
they
thrive
laugh
and
are
glad
of
the
foe
and
the
fight
this
was
my
failure
who
thought
that
the
feast
rivalled
the
rapture
of
bird
on
the
wing
rivalled
the
lily
all
robed
like
a
priest
smoke
of
the
pollen
when
swing
this
was
my
folly
who
gave
for
a
gown
purple
and
gold
and
a
bracelet
and
rings
shouts
in
the
streets
as
i
rode
through
the
town
life
in
the
love
of
the
kinship
of
things
lazarus
lazarus
this
is
my
thirst
fever
from
flame
of
the
love
i
have
missed
ache
of
the
heart
for
the
friends
i
have
cursed
longing
for
lips
that
i
never
have
kissed
hell
is
for
him
who
hath
never
found
god
hid
in
the
bramble
that
burns
by
the
way
findeth
him
not
in
the
stone
and
the
clod
heareth
him
not
at
the
cool
of
the
day
hell
is
for
him
who
hath
never
found
man
god
and
my
brother
i
failing
to
find
failed
to
find
me
so
my
days
were
a
span
void
of
the
triumph
of
spirit
and
mind
once
i
recall
at
the
table
i
leaned
back
on
the
breast
of
pomona
my
slave
saw
through
the
window
with
screened
thee
in
thy
rags
and
i
laughed
then
grew
grave
up
the
white
street
came
a
man
with
a
face
sad
with
the
woe
and
the
pain
of
the
world
moving
with
kingliness
ease
and
a
grace
crowned
with
hair
wavy
and
curled
over
broad
shoulders
so
broad
that
i
vowed
here
was
messias
the
samson
the
king
leaped
from
the
table
and
joined
with
the
crowd
offered
my
purple
my
bracelet
my
ring
then
through
the
clamour
and
dust
of
the
street
words
of
rebuke
were
directed
to
me
lift
thou
up
lazarus
give
him
a
seat
high
among
all
who
are
feasting
with
thee
lift
up
the
beggar
i
laughed
at
him
there
thou
and
thy
tattered
ones
take
to
the
street
i
to
the
palace
begone
and
beware
caiaphas
comes
and
the
sanhedrin
meet
go
or
i
hale
thee
to
judgment
of
them
go
or
thy
god
shall
avail
thee
in
vain
thou
art
of
japheth
and
i
am
of
shem
lazarus
outcast
and
cursed
with
cain
needs
must
there
be
a
division
of
men
hewer
of
wood
is
the
gibeonite
cutter
of
stone
in
the
quarries
and
then
slave
to
the
nay
all
are
equal
and
loved
of
the
lord
whispered
the
stranger
the
listening
street
filled
with
the
murmur
of
those
who
adored
hushed
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
that
was
sweet
stirring
my
heart
as
a
harp
in
the
hall
silent
for
ages
is
stirred
by
the
wind
breathed
through
the
arras
and
memories
call
over
the
summits
of
spirit
and
mind
yea
for
a
moment
i
struggled
with
love
yearned
to
embrace
thee
and
pour
on
thy
hair
oil
of
anointing
and
place
thee
above
all
of
the
guests
who
were
gathering
there
there
in
my
palace
of
pleasure
and
ease
builded
by
herod
and
bought
with
my
gold
portaled
and
curtained
with
soft
tapestries
woven
at
looms
of
the
orient
sold
down
in
damascus
a
palm
in
the
sands
that
was
my
palace
a
palm
with
a
soul
breathing
of
beauty
when
each
leaf
expands
out
to
the
desert
which
brims
like
a
bowl
brims
like
a
bowl
of
falernian
wine
turned
to
the
sun
o
my
palace
and
hall
o
sound
of
the
psaltery
under
the
vine
grown
in
the
garden
o
footsteps
that
fall
soft
as
the
leaves
in
a
pomegranate
grove
soft
on
the
pavement
of
beryl
and
pearl
under
the
moon
when
my
miriam
strove
laughing
to
dance
down
the
syrian
girl
these
thrust
between
my
compassion
and
thee
beauty
that
mocked
like
a
maid
from
her
bower
beauty
that
looked
through
the
lattice
at
me
sighed
i
have
tarried
my
love
for
this
hour
then
to
the
palace
all
flaming
i
went
flaming
with
love
for
pomona
my
pride
back
like
a
bow
her
dear
body
i
bent
kissed
her
and
placed
her
in
joy
at
my
side
crowned
her
with
myrtle
proclaimed
her
a
queen
drank
to
her
eyes
and
her
lips
and
her
hair
clasped
on
her
throat
of
an
ivory
sheen
gems
of
an
order
kings
only
might
wear
oh
how
she
sparkled
and
gleamed
like
a
sword
oh
how
the
cymbals
and
tabours
did
sound
oh
my
pomona
my
loved
and
adored
dust
of
the
body
is
dust
of
the
ground
for
i
forgot
him
and
bought
with
my
gold
houses
and
lands
yea
i
sought
far
and
wide
pleasure
and
ease
then
one
day
i
was
old
darkness
came
over
the
noon
and
i
died
dead
and
companioned
in
pomp
to
the
grave
dead
and
forgotten
in
less
than
a
day
save
by
pomona
my
mistress
and
slave
sold
unto
herod
oh
she
had
a
way
turn
of
the
head
and
glance
of
the
eye
touch
of
the
hand
and
a
fall
of
the
feet
voice
that
was
coo
of
the
dove
and
a
cry
heard
in
the
night
when
the
seraphim
meet
sometimes
i
fancy
gehenna
abyss
gleams
with
a
light
that
is
love
and
i
feel
lips
on
my
lips
in
the
tenderest
kiss
making
hell
heaven
as
though
the
appeal
sent
from
my
soul
to
pomona
had
gained
heart
and
the
whole
of
her
throned
on
a
star
where
for
an
son
of
bliss
she
hath
reigned
lonely
for
dives
so
lost
and
afar
lazarus
nearer
the
light
on
thy
face
shines
through
the
dark
oh
what
glory
is
thine
nay
not
too
near
lest
thou
see
my
disgrace
naked
behold
bruised
the
image
divine
lazarus
pity
pursue
not
my
soul
down
the
last
gulf
i
am
fearful
of
thee
not
of
jehovah
whose
thunders
may
roll
over
my
head
have
thou
pity
on
me
this
have
i
learned
in
the
torment
of
hell
man
is
the
judge
of
the
soul
that
hath
sin
man
must
raise
man
from
the
depths
where
he
fell

by
the
hand
of
his
passion

of
the
light
and
the
dark
stand
on
the
cloud
that
hath
bridged
the
abyss
judging
my
cause
for
my
spirit
is
stark
under
thy
glance
in
abandon
of
bliss
yea
there
is
joy
in
the
judgment
a
peace
i
have
not
known
in
an
æon
of
pain
joy
in
the
thought
that
thy
love
will
not
cease
till
it
hath
cleansed
all
my
spirit
from
stain
therefore
i
hail
thee
o
lazarus

to
the
love
that
restoreth
the
years

thought
of
my
heart
and
the
tale
of
my
tears

i
am
undone
conquered
by
love
of
a
love
that

begging
for
crumbs

to
her
babe
from
gehenna

rise
cleansed
by
a
love
that
is
mighty
to
save
light
and
the
sound
of
a
song
that
is
love

and
the
freedom
of

to
soar
light
and
messias
enthroned
above
high
where
the
seraphim
bow
and
adore
sonnets
and
songs
fellow
craftsmen
as
in
some
workshop
where
the
hammers
ring
and
artizans

crude
imperfect
member

to
the
completed
plan

full
confidence
and
know
thou
and
thy
god
can
perfect
everything
throughout
the
busy
day
he
works
with
us
and
knows
that
we
are
tired
he
hears
and
feels
the
grind
of
every
cog
the
plaint
the
fuss
the
purr
of
pinions
in
the
thousand
wheels
that
whir
forever
down
the
endless
walls
where
as
we
toil
his
light
perpetual
falls
posca
the
light
within
the
sky
was
growing
dim
a
face
looked
from
a
cross
and
watched
with
dying
eyes
the
soldiers
toss
dice
for
the
seamless
robe
they
stripped
from
him
and
of
that
number
there
was
one
who
first
was
touched
with
pity
for
him
hanging
there
and
ran
a
sponge
of
vinegar
to
bear
when
in
his
anguish
jesus
said
i
thirst
o
nameless
soldier
of
the
long
ago
yours
was
the
doing
of
a
deathless
deed
who
braved
the
people
passing
to
and
fro
and
gave
to
christ
the
sponge
upon
a
reed
the
while
his
own
disciples
standing
near
dismayed
moved
not
to
help
him
in
their
fear
reincarnation
i
saw
three
souls
before
a
jasper
throne
that
stood
beyond
the
world
where
angels
knelt
before
a
presence
furled
white
wings
and
waited
in
vast
undertone
a
voice
said
choose
and
instantly
were
shown
three
chalices
one
like
a
lily
curled
about
a
stem
of
gold
one
was
empearled
in
silver
one
was
carved
from
common
stone
i
saw
three
souls
sink
swiftly
back
to
earth
i
heard
three
children
wailing
in
the
night
i
met
three
men
of
diverse
rank
and
birth
a
king
a
priest
a
slave
whose
wretched
plight
moved
me
to
pity
till
mine
ancient
dream
recalled
the
proverb
things
are
not
what
they
seem
jacob
dream
lonely
and
worn
by
day
dull
toil
and
heat
life
lay
before
me
stark
and
dead
and
drear
night
had
engulfed
the
desert
and
a
fear
was
on
me
as
of
slow
resistless
feet
of
foes
invisible
from
whom
retreat
denied
me
respite
i
knew
the
moment
near
jehovah
hand
uplifted
and
his
spear
through
the
dark
my
heart
to
meet
and
as
i
crouched
to
take
the
stroke
that
fell
swift
from
the
sky
a
cloud
of
cherubim
burst
on
my
vision
with
a
mighty
song
that
filled
the
wilderness
as
though
a
bell
chimed
from
afar
then
someone
said
be
strong
son
of
the
highest
find
thyself
in
him
keats
to
sing
as
thou
didst
in
full
throated
ease
sweeter
than
thine
nightingale
and
with
thy
singing
waken
hill
and
dale
until
the
many
harpstrings
of
the
trees
murmured
in
strange
and
old
antiphonies
to
wander
at
thy
will
into
the
vale
where
sleeps
endymion
and
tell
the
tale
of
dian
nymphs
or
pan
dear
dryades
was
it
in
sooth
too
great
a
price
to
pay
the
and
the
passion
and
the
tears
with
which
god
mixed
for
thee
life
cup
of
gold
against
the
sadness
of
thy
lot
i
hold
the
joy
of
him
who
sees
and
feels
and
hears
earth
splendour
fulness
music
night
and
day
a
poet
prayer
give
me
pause
and
time
for
dreaming
send
me
to
some
quiet
place
where
the
winding
water
gleaming
holds
a
glass
before
my
face
here
within
the
grind
and
clamour
i
forget
what
i
have
known
life
and
love
have
lost
their
glamour
and
my
heart
is
turned
to
stone
shrub
and
bird
and
beast
are
mingled
with
a
clumsy
dream
of
man
lost
the
ancient
art
that
singled
hoof
and
brow
of
brooding
pan
strike
the
rock
release
the
river
bid
it
through
the
desert
go
let
its
shallows
dance
and
quiver
and
its
flood
majestic
flow
till
again
the
rushing
rapture
of
the
poet
soul
is
mine
with
its
swift
pursuit
to
capture
visions
that
are
all
divine
what
is
religion
what
is
religion
word
of
many
creeds
blared
forth
in
streets
by
solemn
pharisee
and
piped
in
doleful
tones
on
scrannel
reeds
untouched
by
love
or
tender
sympathy
that
moves
the
soldier
where
the
master
bleeds
what
is
religion
lofty
and
rich
mosaics
on
the
chancel
wall
deep
and
choirs
whose
golden
glorias
night
and
morning
fall
with
and
flares
of
what
is
religion
note
of
bird
on
bough
the
sunlight
falling
the
waving
grass
a
child
clear
gaze
and
unashamed
brow
the
little
deeds
that
living
come
and
pass
and
are
forgot
religion
is
i
trow
what
is
religion
why
who
anywhere
stoops
down
to
touch
the
dusty
and
then
as
tenderly
the
face
of
care
who
thus
in
love
lives
on
from
hour
to
hour
has
caught
the
secret
and
has
mastered
prayer
a
song
of
spring
little
laughter
of
the
grass
clapping
of
soft
tiny
hands
fleeting
forms
that
come
and
pass
in
relays
of
fairy
bands
and
the
birds
upon
the
wing
tell
the
secret
it
is
spring
in
the
woods
the
dryades
hear
the
sounding
pipes
of
pan
leave
their
temples
of
the
trees
and
return
to
haunts
of
man
this
the
song
they
sweetly
sing
ave
ave
it
is
spring
domed
with
sapphire
is
the
sky
haze
of
opal
hath
the
hills
brown
the
brooks
that
rushing
by
call
to
their
companion
rills
these
their
joyous
welcome
bring
hail
all
hail
for
it
is
spring
a
fallen

of

for
what
we
on
ourselves
have
wrought
wild
havoc
with
the
weird
grotesque
abortive
images
of
thought
making
of
beauty
the
burlesque
for
much
pretence
in
praying
and
little
heart
at
playing
for
smothered
smiles
and
countless
guiles
cry
we
mercy
god
for
casting
dice
where
jesus
bleeds
upon
his
cross
naked
alone
unheedful
in
the
noise
of
creeds
of
him
and
his
last
dying
moan
for
rahab
robed
in
scarlet
cursed
with
the
title
harlot
by
the
decrees
of
pharisees
cry
we
mercy
god
for
the
delight
of
missed
in
our
minsters
made
of
stone
unmindful
that
pure
incense
pours
to
thee
from
wild
blown
down
that
altar
fires
burn
in
the
sunset
on
the
hills
and
from
the
ancient
spires
the
varied
chime
of
evening
fills
all
hearts
with
rapture
for
the
light
lost
on
white
lilies
and
the
blue
of
heaven
wasted
the
dear
night
with
her
gold
stars
and
silver
dew
neglected
oh
for
what
we
fail
to
find
from
life
so
rich
and
fair
the
rain
the
snow
the
sleet
the
hail
summer
and
air
for
every
useless
sorrow
and
fears
for
the
not
knowing
thee
great
deity
cry
we
mercy
god
the
great
comrade
i
hear
thy
voice
within
the
world
thy
thunder
from
the
heaven
hurled
i
lean
and
listen
to
the
trees
chanting
thine
litanies
over
white
leagues
of
ice
and
snow
through
drift
and
storm
i
watch
thee
go
upon
the
sea
sad
surge
behold
marks
of
thy
journeyings
manifold
where
lilies
lowly
bow
the
head
some
marvel
of
thyself
is
shed
earth
joyous
wild
and
wandering
things
are
hints
of
thy
rememberings
from
mist
of
stars
upward
to
man
lord
all
thy
ways
i
dimly
scan
to
what
divine
and
unguessed
goals
comrade
invitest
thou
all
souls
a
revery
the
green
sea
surges
up
to
land
i
feel
its
salt
breath
on
my
cheek
in
tones
it
seems
to
speak
as
it
falls
thundering
seething
on
the
sand
the
wild
gulls
circling
sweep
and
cry
a
thin
mist
veils
the
crimson
west
the
great
red
sun
sinks
swiftly
down
to
rest
a
dying
flame
crawls
flickering
up
the
sky
deep
darkness
and
the
sullen
boom
of
sea
receding
into
dark
i
hear
a

lights
that
pierce
the
gloom
night
and
remoteness
of
the
stars
vast
unrevealed
infinitude
of
ocean
and
the
interlude
of
sobbing
from
the
sandy
bars
dear
and
dark
and
tall
lady
of
my
heart
summer
roses
fall
now
that
we
must
part
what
has
happened
dear
all
the
flowers
are
dead
since
you
are
not
near
laughter
too
is
fled
all
the
tender
blue
turned
to
tearful
gray
when
i
said
to
you
and
went
away

to
michal
from
the

o

heart
of
the

mine
in
the
garden
of
saul
david
before
saul
from
the
witch
of
endor
down
by
the
stream
of
the
waters
came
the
king
and
his
face
was
sad
sad
with
a
grief
beyond
belief
for
a
bitter
grief
he
had
to
be
a
king
means
sorrowing
a
king
may
not
be
glad
down
by
the
stream
of
the
waters
came
the
king
and
alone
at
night
his
robe
was
torn
a
crown
of
thorn
was
on
his
brow
so
white
they
placed
it
there
who
did
not
care
his
eyes
with
tears
were
bright
down
by
the
stream
of
the
waters
where
it
flows
through
the
valley
of
death
he
came
the
king
all
sorrowing
a
sob
was
in
his
breath
they
broke
his
heart
who
stood
apart
the
crowd
that
wondereth
a
villanelle
of
fate
when
the
day
of
life
is
done
and
the
tools
are
laid
aside
we
shall
slumber
one
by
one
norns
their
threads
of
fate
have
spun
lust
and
virtue
grace
and
pride
when
the
day
of
life
is
done
all
that
we
have
here
begun
must
be
scattered
far
and
wide
we
shall
slumber
one
by
one
gone
the
folly
and
the
fun
spilled
the
wine
and
spent
the
tide
when
the
day
of
life
is
done
by
the
marge
of
acheron
shall
dear
dreams
be
then
denied
when
we
slumber
one
by
one
build
your
tower
to
the
sun
surely
death
may
be
defied
when
the
day
of
life
is
done
shall
we
slumber
one
by
one
one
woman
o
light
that
overflows
o
wind
that
wildly
blows
o
sweet
and
tender
grace
all
in
one
woman
face
o
love
that
is
like
fire
o
pain
that
is
desire
o
melodies
that
start
all
in
one
woman
heart
