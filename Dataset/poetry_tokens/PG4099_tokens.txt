this
poem
is
inscribed
to
the
memory
of
her
by
whom
and
for
whom
i
became
a
poet
introduction
there
could
be
but
one
answer
to
the
suggestion
of
coventry
patmore
that
his
in
the
might
usefully
have
a
place
in
this
the
suggestion
was
made
with
the
belief
that
wide
and
cheap
diffusion
would
not
take
from
the
value
of
a
copyright
library
edition
while
the
best
use
of
writing
is
fulfilled
by
the
spreading
of
verse
dedicated
to
the
sacred
love
of
home
the
two
parts
of
the
poem
appeared

vaughan
his

who
more
than
he
desired
his
fame
but
in
his
heart
his
thoughts
were
rife
how
for
her
sake
to
earn
a
name
with
bays
poetic
three
times
and

with
her

fields
they
their
children
shouting
by
the
way
careless
of
the
gift
of
song
nor
out
of
love
with
noble
fame
i
meditating
much
and
long
what
i
should
sing
how
win
a
name
considering
well
what
theme
unsung
what
reason
worth
the
cost
of
rhyme
remains
to
loose
the
tongue
in
these
last
days
the
dregs
of
time
learn
that
to
me
though
born
so
late
there
does
beyond
desert
befall
may
my
great
fortune
make
me
great
the
first
of
themes
sung
last
of
all
in
green
and
ground
yet
near
where
many
others
sing
i
have
the
very
found
whence
gushes
the
pierian
then
she
is
it
dear
the
life
of
arthur
or
fall
your
gentle
self
my
wife
and
love
that
grows
from
one
to
all
and
if
i
faithfully
proclaim
of
these
the
exceeding
worthiness
surely
the
sweetest
wreath
of
fame
shall
to
your
hope
my
brows
caress
and
if
by
virtue
of
my
choice
of
this
the
most
theme
that
ever
tuned
a
voice
i
live
as
i
am
bold
to
dream
to
be
delight
to
many
days
and
into
silence
only
cease
when
those
are
still
who
shared
their
bays
with
laura
and
with
beatrice
imagine
love
how
learned
men
will
devices
find
beyond
my
purpose
and
my
ken
an
ancient
bard
of
simple
mind
you
sweet
his
mistress
wife
and
muse
were
you
for
mortal
woman
meant
your
praises
give
a
hundred
clues
to
mythological
intent
and
severing
thus
the
truth
from
trope
in
you
the
commentators
see
outlines
occult
of
abstract
scope
a
future
for
philosophy
your
on
mine
these
are
the
meads
in
which
we
pass
our
living
days
there
avon
runs
now
hid
with
reeds
now
brightly
brimming
pebbly
bays
those
are
our
songs
that
come
with
bells
and
bleatings
of
the
sheep
and
there
in
yonder
english
home
we
thrive
on
mortal
food
and
sleep
she
how
proud
she
always
was
to
feel
how
proud
he
was
of
her
but
he
had
grown
distraught
because
the
mood
began
to
stir
his
purpose
with
performance
he
to
his
wife
when
next
their
came
round
his
labour
the
canto
i
the
cathedral
close
preludes
i
lo
by
all
right
that
all
should
know
what
they
obey
lest
erring
conscience
damp
delight
and
folly
laugh
our
joys
away
thou
primal
love
who
grantest
wings
and
voices
to
the
woodland
birds
grant
me
the
power
of
saying
things
too
simple
and
too
sweet
for
words
ii
i
walk
i
trust
with
open
eyes
half
my
worldly
course
and
in
the
way
behind
me
lies
much
vanity
and
some
remorse
lived
to
feel
how
pride
may
part
spirits
like
hand
and
glove
for
abode
the
heart
but
have
not
disbelieved
in
love
nor
unto
love
sole
mortal
thing
of
worth
immortal
done
the
wrong
to
count
it
with
the
rest
that
sing
unworthy
of
a
serious
song
and
love
is
my
reward
for
now
when
most
of
time
complain
the
myrtle
blooms
upon
my
brow
its
odour
quickens
all
my
brain
iii
the
richest
realm
of
all
the
earth
is
counted
still
a
heathen
land
lo
i
like
joshua
now
go
forth
to
give
it
into
hand
i
will
not
hearken
blame
or
praise
for
so
should
i
dishonour
do
to
that
sweet
power
by
which
these
lays
alone
are
lovely
good
and
true
nor
credence
to
the
cries
give
which
ever
preach
and
still
prevent
pure
high
prerogative
to
make
not
follow
precedent
from
abysmal
ether
rare
if
i
to
men
have
here
made
known
new
truths
they
like
new
stars
were
there
before
though
not
yet
written
down
moving
but
as
the
feelings
move
i
run
or
loiter
with
delight
or
pause
to
mark
where
gentle
love
persuades
the
soul
from
height
to
height
yet
know
ye
though
my
words
are
gay
as
dance
which
michal
if
kindly
you
receive
the
lay
you
shall
be
sweetly
and
the
cathedral
close
once
more
i
came
to
sarum
close
with
joy
half
memory
half
desire
and
breathed
the
sunny
wind
that
rose
and
blew
the
shadows
the
spire
and
the
scented
plumes
and
the
thousand
cones
and
my
nostrils
with
perfumes
and
shaped
the
clouds
in
waifs
and
zones
and
wafted
down
the
serious
strain
of
sarum
bells
when
true
to
time
i
the
with
heart
and
brain
that
trembled
to
the
trembling
chime
half
my
home
six
years
ago
the
six
years
had
not
it
and
ashlar
long
and
low
with
dormers
and
with
oriels
lit
geranium
lychnis
rose
the
windows
all
wide
open
thrown
and
some
one
in
the
study
the
of
mendelssohn
and
there
it
was
i
last
took
leave
christmas
i
now
the
cruel
girls
who
to
grieve
took
down
the
evergreens
and
how
the
holly
into
blazes
woke
the
fire
lighting
the
large
low
room
a
dim
rich
lustre
of
old
oak
and
crimson
glowing
gloom
no
change
had
dean
churchill
kind
by
widowhood
more
than
winters
bent
and
settled
in
a
cheerful
mind
as
still
forecasting
content
well
might
his
thoughts
be
on
high
now
she
was
there
within
her
face
humility
and
dignity
were
met
in
a
most
sweet
embrace
she
expressly
sent
below
to
teach
our
erring
minds
to
see
the
rhythmic
change
of
swift
flow
as
part
of
still
eternity
her
life
all
honour
observed
with
awe
which
cross
experience
could
not
mar
the
fiction
of
the
christian
law
that
all
men
honourable
are
and
so
her
smile
at
once
high
flattery
and
benign
reproof
and
i
a
rude
boy
strangely
grew
courtly
in
my
own
behoof
the
years
so
far
from
doing
her
wrong
anointed
her
with
gracious
balm
and
made
her
brows
more
and
more
young
with
wreaths
of
amaranth
and
palm
was
this
her
eldest
honor
prude
who
would
not
let
me
pull
the
swing
who
at
christmas
me
rude
and
sobbing
low
refused
to
sing
how
changed
in
shape
no
slender
grace
but
venus
milder
than
the
dove
her
air
her
norman
face
her
large
sweet
eyes
clear
lakes
of
love
mary
i
knew
in
former
time
ailing
and
pale
she
thought
that
bliss
was
only
for
a
better
clime
and
heavenly
overmuch
this
i
rash
with
theories
of
the
right
which
the
tether
of
my
creed
but
did
not
break
it
held
delight
half
discipline
we
disagreed
she
told
the
dean
i
wanted
grace
now
she
was
kindest
of
the
three
and
soft
wild
roses
her
face
and
what
was
this
my
mildred
she
to
herself
and
all
a
sweet
surprise
my
pet
who
and
a
hoop
i
where
those
daisy
eyes
had
found
their
touching
curve
and
droop
unmannerly
times
but
now
we
sat
stranger
than
strangers
till
i
caught
and
smile
and
that
spread
to
the
rest
and
freedom
brought
the
dean
little
looking
on
of
three
such
daughters
justly
vain
what
letters
they
had
had
from
bonn
said
mildred
and
what
plums
from
spain
by
honor
i
was
kindly
to
excuse
my
never
coming
down
from
cambridge
mary
smiled
and
were
kant
and
goethe
yet
outgrown
and
pleased
we
the
old
days
and
parting
i
for
pleasure
to
be
there
as
a
friend
since
more
then
seems
still
excuse
for
pride
for
something
that
abode
endued
with
repose
an
air
of
kind
purposes
pursued
with
freedom
sweet
and
fair
a
tent
in
a
world
not
right
it
whose
inmates
every
one
on
tranquil
faces
bore
the
light
of
duties
beautifully
done
and
humbly
though
they
had
few
peers
kept
their
own
laws
which
to
be
the
fair
sum
of
six
thousand
traditions
of
civility
canto
ii
mary
and
mildred
preludes
i
when
i
behold
the
skies
aloft
passing
the
pageantry
of
dreams
the
cloud
whose
bosom
a
couch
for
nuptial
juno
seems
the
ocean
broad
the
mountains
bright
the
shadowy
vales
with
feeding
herds
i
from
my
lyre
the
music
smite
nor
want
for
justly
matching
words
all
forces
of
the
sea
and
air
all
interests
of
hill
and
plain
i
so
can
sing
in
seasons
fair
that
who
hath
felt
may
feel
again
elated
oft
by
such
free
songs
i
think
with
utterance
free
to
raise
that
hymn
for
which
the
whole
world
longs
a
worthy
hymn
in
praise
a
hymn
like
a
arousing
these
times
with
rhapsodies
of
perfect
words
ruled
by
returning
kiss
of
rhymes
but
when
i
look
on
her
and
hope
to
tell
with
joy
what
i
admire
my
thoughts
lie
in
narrow
scope
or
in
the
feeble
birth
expire
no
mystery
of
speech
no
simplest
phrase
of
tenderest
fall
no
excellence
can
reach
her
thee
most
excellent
of
all
the
best
half
of
best
its
heart
to
feel
its
eye
to
see
the
crown
and
complex
of
the
rest
its
aim
and
its
epitome
nay
might
i
utter
my
conceit
after
all
a
vulgar
song
for
so
simply
subtly
sweet
my
deepest
rapture
does
her
wrong
yet
is
it
now
my
chosen
task
to
sing
her
worth
as
maid
and
wife
nor
happier
post
than
this
i
ask
to
live
her
laureate
all
my
life
on
wings
of
love
uplifted
free
and
by
her
gentleness
made
great
teach
how
noble
man
should
be
to
match
with
such
a
lovely
mate
and
then
in
her
may
move
the
more
the
wish
to
be
desired
by
praise
increased
till
both
shall
soar
with
blissful
emulations
fired
and
as
geranium
pink
or
rose
is
thrice
itself
through
power
of
art
so
may
my
happy
skill
disclose
new
fairness
even
in
her
fair
heart
until
that
churl
shall
nowhere
be
who
bends
not
awed
before
the
throne
of
her
affecting
majesty
so
meek
so
far
unlike
our
own
until
for
who
may
hope
too
much
from
her
who
wields
the
powers
of
love
our
lifted
lives
at
last
shall
touch
that
happy
goal
to
which
they
move
until
we
find
as
darkness
rolls
away
and
evil
mists
dissolve
that
nuptial
contrasts
are
the
poles
on
which
the
heavenly
spheres
revolve
ii
at
i
come
where
ladies
are
how
sad
soever
i
was
before
though
like
a
ship
and
far
withheld
in
ice
from
the
roar
in
that
dreadful
dock
with
cordage
sails
and
crew
that
care
for
calm
and
shock
alike
too
dull
to
be
yet
if
i
come
where
ladies
are
how
sad
soever
i
was
before
then
is
my
sadness
far
and
i
am
like
that
ship
no
more
or
like
that
ship
if
the
splits
burst
by
the
sudden
polar
spring
and
all
thank
god
with
their
warming
wits
and
kiss
each
other
and
dance
and
sing
and
hoist
fresh
sails
that
make
the
breeze
blow
them
along
the
liquid
sea
out
of
the
north
where
life
did
freeze
into
the
haven
where
they
would
be
iii
and
anne
lived
so
truly
from
above
she
was
so
gentle
and
so
good
that
duty
bade
me
fall
in
love
and
for
that
thought
i
should
i
kate
with
all
my
will
in
idle
moods
you
seem
to
see
a
noble
spirit
in
a
hill
a
human
touch
about
a
tree
iv
the
lack
of
lovely
pride
in
her
who
strives
to
please
my
pleasure
numbs
and
still
the
maid
i
most
prefer
whose
care
to
please
with
pleasing
comes
mary
and
mildred
one
morning
after
church
i
alone
with
mary
on
the
lawn
and
felt
myself
we
to
grave
themes
delicately
drawn
when
she
delighted
found
i
knew
more
of
her
peace
than
she
supposed
our
confidences
heavenwards
grew
like
buds
in
pairs
disclosed
our
former
faults
did
we
confess
our
ancient
feud
was
more
than
and
with
the
eagerness
for
amity
and
she
offering
up
for
sacrifice
her
reserve
brought
out
to
show
some
verses
made
when
she
was
ice
to
all
but
heaven
six
years
ago
since
happier
grown
i
took
and
read
the
lines
she
void
of
guile
too
late
repenting
and
said
i
must
not
think
about
the
style
after
day
until
imaged
the
others
gone
before
the
same
dull
task
the
weary
way
the
weakness
and
thwarted
thirst
too
faintly
felt
for
forgotten
life
the
restless
heart
which
when
i
knelt
made
of
my
worship
barren
strife
whence
so
sweet
release
this
clearance
light
of
all
my
care
this
conscience
free
this
fertile
peace
these
softly
folded

is
never

either
in

grown
weary
with
a
exile
from
those
fair
friends
i
rode
to
see
the
lounged
awhile
and
met
the
dean
was
to
tea
and
found
their
cousin
frederick
graham
at
side
was
i
if
when
she
sang
his
colour
came
that
mine
as
with
a
buffet
a
man
to
please
a
girl
thought
i
retorting
his
forced
smiles
the
shrouds
of
wrath
so
hid
as
she
was
by
sweet
moon
between
her
lighted
clouds
whether
this
cousin
was
the
cause
i
know
not
but
i
to
see
the
first
time
then
how
fair
she
was
how
much
the
fairest
of
the
three
each
to
let
the
other
go
but
he
arose
the
first
he
in
sarum
long
if
so
i
hoped
to
see
him
at
the
hurst
no
he
had
here
on
his
way
to
portsmouth
where
the
arrogant
his
ship
was
he
should
leave
next
day
for
two
cruise
in
the
levant
had
love
in
her
yet
struck
its
germs
i
her
farewell
me
plain
she
loved
on
the
majestic
terms
that
she
should
not
be
loved
again
and
so
her
cousin
parting
felt
hope
in
his
voice
and
eye
was
dead
compassion
did
my
malice
melt
then
went
i
home
to
a
restless
bed
i
who
admired
her
too
could
see
his
infinite
remorse
at
this
great
mystery
that
she
should
be
so
beautiful
yet
not
be
his
and
pitying
to
plead
his
part
but
scarce
could
tell
so
strange
my
whim
whether
the
weight
upon
my
heart
was
sorrow
for
myself
or
him
she
was
all
mildness
yet
writ
in
all
her
grace
most
legibly
for
heaven
itself
unfit
let
him
not
hope
to
merit
and
such
a
challenge
quite
apart
from
thoughts
of
love
humbled
and
thus
to
sweet
repentance
moved
my
heart
and
made
me
more
magnanimous
and
led
me
to
review
my
life
inquiring
where
in
aught
the
least
if
question
were
of
her
for
wife
ill
might
be
mended
hope
not
that
i
so
far
above
myself
as
this
great
hope
to
dare
and
yet
i
well
foresaw
that
love
might
hope
where
reason
must
despair
and
the
sweet
pride
which
would
not
ask
me
to
admire
to
my
secret
heart
i
i
were
worthy
to
desire
as
drowsiness
my
brain
a
shrill
defiance
of
all
to
arms

the
an
angry
answer
from
three
farms
and
then
i
that
i
her
knight

haughty
pathos
heard
and
rode
securely
to
the
fight
cased
in
the
scarf
she
had
and
there
the
bristling
lists
behind
saw
many

all

perverted
all

to
complaint
how
vain

had

how
ignorant

strange

birds
how
dull

continual
change
how
foolishly
content

unaccountable

law
which
bade
me
sit
in
blindness
here

reckon
and
define

modes
of
martyrdom
in

how
far
each
one
might
be
mine

thought
how
love
whose
vast
estate
is
earth
and
air
and
sun
and
sea
encounters
oft
the
fate
despised
on

of
poverty
how
heaven
inscrutable
in
this
lets
the
gross
general
make
or
mar
the
destiny
of
love
which
is
so
tender
and
particular
how
nature
as
unnatural
and
contradicting
source
which
is
but
love
seems
most
of
all
to
harry
true
course
how
many
times
it
comes
to
pass
that
trifling
shades
of
temperament
affecting
only
one
alas
not
love
but
success

rose
i
held
the

and
as
her

assured
me
that
she
always
wore
a

as
happy
as
her

and
jealous
of

blew

either

paints

with

with
calm
as

the

with

like
the
wind
and
none
knows
whence
or
why
they
rise

before
felt

mind
so
much
affected
through
mine
eyes
how
cognate
with
the
air
how
for
familiar
zone
she
moved
how
feeling
and
how
fair
for
pleasure
and
her
own
and
ah
the
heaven
of
her
face
how
when
she
i
to
see
the
gladness
of
the
primal
grace
and
how
when
grave
its
dignity
of
all
she
was
the
least
not
less
delighted
the
devoted
eye
no
fold
or
fashion
of
her
dress
her
fairness
did
not
sanctify
i
could
not
else
than
grieve
what
cause
was
i
not
blest
was
she
not
there
likely
my
own
ah
that
it
was
how
like
to
despair
and
yet
to
see
her
so
benign
so
honourable
and
womanly
in
every
maiden
kindness
mine
and
full
of
gayest
courtesy
was
pleasure
so
without
alloy
such
unreproved
sufficient
bliss
i
almost
the
while
that
joy
might
never
further
go
than
this
so
much
it
was
as
now
to
walk
and
humbly
by
her
gentle
side
observe
her
smile
and
hear
her
talk
could
it
be
more
to
call
her
bride

her
won
the
mind

and
by
stress

strain
to
comprehend
the
whole
delight
made
bliss
more
hard
to
bear
than
pain

good
save
heart
to
hold
so
and
the
thought
smote
like
a
knife
how
mortality
had
the
feelings
to
the
feast
of
life
how
passing
good
breathes
sweetest
breath
and
love
itself
at
highest
reveals
more
black
than
bright
commending
death
by
teaching
how
much
life
conceals
but
happier
passions
these
subdued
when
from
the
close
and
sultry
lane
with
eyes
made
bright
by
what
they
we
emerged
upon
the
mounded
plain
as
to
the
breeze
a
flag
unfurls
my
spirit
expanded
sweetly
embraced
by
those
same
gusts
that
shook
her
curls
and
the
ribbon
at
her
waist
to
the
future
cast
i
future
cares
breathed
with
a
heart
unfreighted
free
and
at
the
presumptuous
airs
that
with
her
muslins
folded
me
till
one
vague
rack
along
my
sky
the
thought
that
she
might
be
mine
lay
half
forgotten
by
the
eye
so
feasted
with
the
warm
shine
by
the
great
stones
we
chose
our
ground
for
shade
and
there
in
converse
sweet
took
luncheon
on
a
little
mound
sat
the
three
ladies
at
their
feet
i
sat
and
smelt
the
heathy
smell
harebells
the
telescope
to
the
country
round
my
life
went
well
for
once
without
the
wheels
of
hope
and
i
despised
the
druid
rocks
that
their
chill
gloom
from
above
like
churls
whose
stolid
wisdom
mocks
the
lightness
of
immortal
love
and
as

the

the
candid

at
our
untruthful
strangeness

with
mine
her
smiling
eyes
and
sweet
familiarness
and
awe
that
hour
on
either
part
and
in
the
eternal
light
i
saw
that
she
was
mine
though
yet
my
heart
could
not
conceive
nor
would
confess
such
contentation
and
there
grew
more
form
and
more
fair
stateliness
than
heretofore
between

man
must
be
pleased
but
him
to
please
is
pleasure
down
the
gulf
of
his
condoled
necessities
she
casts
her
best
she
flings
herself
how
often
flings
for
nought
and
yokes
her
heart
to
an
icicle
or
whim
whose
each
impatient
word
provokes
another
not
from
her
but
him
while
she
too
gentle
even
to
force
his
penitence
by
kind
replies
waits
by
expecting
his
remorse
with
pardon
in
her
pitying
eyes
and
if
he
once
by
shame
a
comfortable
word
confers
she
leans
and
weeps
against
his
breast
and
seems
to
think
the
sin
was
hers
and
whilst
his
love
has
any
life
or
any
eye
to
see
her
charms
at
any
time
still
his
wife
dearly
devoted
to
his

she
loves
with

that
can
not
tire
and
when
ah
woe
she
loves
alone

passionate

springs
higher
as

is
nature
in
thee
too
spiritless
ignoble
impotent
and
dead
to
prize
her
love
and
loveliness

more
for
being
thy

art
thou
one

vile
crew
which
see
no

in

praising
alone
the
good
new
or
over
or
not

has
it
on
thy

that
love
warms

as
soft

though
swathed
round
with
benefits
thou
art
not
singularly
blest
and

thy

for

because
they
are
not

thine

lest
in
the

thou
art
cast
for
thy

forth
from

good

to

a

is

because
the
so

i
stood
by
honor
and
the

they
seated
in
the
london
train
a
month
from

yet

had
been
ere
now
without

bitter
pain
but
neighbourhood
makes

and

remedy
has
none

i
felt
as
might
a
blind
man
sitting
in
the
sun
she
near
all
for
the
time
was
well
self
when
we
were
far
apart
with
lonely
feeling
like
the
smell
of
heath
on
mountains
my
heart
to
see
her
full
scope
and
her
kind
smile
so
clear
of
care
then
though
darkening
all
my
hope
gilded
the
cloud
of
my
despair
she
had
forgot
to
bring
a
book
i
lent
one
blamed
the
print
for
old
and
did
not
tell
her
that
she
took
a
petrarch
worth
its
weight
in
gold
i
hoped
lose
it
for
my
love
was
grown
so
dainty
high
and
nice
it
prized
no
luxury
above
the
sense
of
fruitless
sacrifice
the
bell
rang
and
with
shrieks
like
death
link
catching
link
the
long
array
with
ponderous
pulse
and
fiery
breath
proud
of
its
burthen
swept
away
and
through
the
lingering
crowd
i
broke
sought
the
and
thence
beheld
far
off
the
little
smoke
along
the
landscape
kindling
quick
what
should
i
do
where
should
i
go
now
she
was
gone
my
love
for
mine
she
was
whatever
here
below
or
my
right
divine
life
without
her
was
vain
and
gross
the
glory
from
the
world
was
gone
and
on
the
gardens
of
the
close
as
on
sahara
shone
the
sun
with
her
departed
grace
my
thoughts
on
ill
surmises
fed
the
harmful
influence
of
the
place
she
went
to
my
soul
with
dread
she
mixing
with
the
people
there
might
come
back
having
caught
the
foolish
fashionable
air
of
knowing
all
and
feeling
nought
or
giddy
with
her
praise
scorn
our
simple
country
life
its
wholesome
nights
and
tranquil
days
and
would
not
deign
to
be
my
wife
wife
wife
ah
tenderest
word
how
oft
as
fearful
she
might
hear
whispering
that
name
of
i
heard
the
chiming
of
the
inmost
sphere
i
the
home
of
my
regret
the
clock
was
striking
in
the
hall
and
one
sad
window
open
yet
although
the
dews
began
to
fall
ah
distance
her
scope
how
light
of
heart
and
innocent
that
loveliness
which
hope
and
wore
the
world
for
ornament
how
perfectly
her
life
was
framed
and
thought
of
in
that
passionate
mood
how
her
affecting
graces
shamed
the
vulgar
life
that
was
but
good
i
would
her
bird
be
fed
her
she
not
by
loading
my
breast
with
angry
dread
of
light
unlikely
injury
so
with
love
and
fond
remorse
i
paced
the
close
its
every
part
with
reliquary
force
to
heal
and
raise
from
death
my
heart
how
tranquil
and
unsecular
the
precinct
once
through
yonder
gate
i
saw
her
go
and
knew
from
far
her
form
and
gentle
state
her
dress
had
this
wicket
here
she
her
face
and
with
light
like
moonbeams
on
a
wavering
mere
weary
beforehand
of
the
night
i
went
the
blackbird
in
the
wood
by
himself
and
eastward
grew
in
heaven
the
symbol
of
my
mood
where
one
bright
star
the
blue
canto

i
joyful
would
wisdom
for
herself
be
and
wake
the
foolish
from
his
dream
she
must
be
glad
as
well
as
good
and
must
not
only
be
but
seem
beauty
and
joy
are
hers
by
right
and
knowing
this
i
wonder
less
that
so
when
falsely
dight
in
misery
and
ugliness
that
which
heaven
to
man
endears
and
that
which
eyes
no
sooner
see
than
the
heart
says
with
floods
of
tears
the
thing
which
i
would
be
not
childhood
full
of
frown
and
fret
not
youth
impatient
to
disown
those
visions
high

to

were

at

should
move

of

so
much
they
live
by

they
taste
in

nothing

spiritual
joy
they
shine
like
moses
in

and
teach
our
hearts
without

let
dove
and
snake
and
snake
and
dove
this
be
that
device
going
to
church
i
woke
at
three
for
i
was
bid
to
breakfast
with
the
dean
at
nine
and
thence
to
church
my
curtain
slid
i
found
the
dawning
sunday
fine
and
could
not
rest
so
rose
the
air
was
dark
and
sharp
the
roosted
birds
am
i
sweet
are
you
there
on
misty
flats
the
herds
expected
comfortless
the
day
which
slowly
fired
the
clouds
above
the
cock
somewhere
far
away
in
sleep
the
matrimonial
dove
was
crooning
no
wind
waked
the
wood
nor
moved
the
midnight
nor
the
poplar
quiet
stood
the
chestnut
with
its
thousand
lamps
the
moon
shone
yet
but
weak
and
drear
and
to
watch
with
bated
breath
the
landscape
all
made
sharp
and
clear
by
stillness
as
a
face
by
death
my
for
her
being
done
i
took
occasion
by
the
quiet
hour
to
find
and
know
by
rule
and
book
the
rights
of
beloved
power
fronting
the
question
without
ruth
nor
ignorant
that
evermore
if
men
will
stoop
to
kiss
the
truth
she
lifts
them
higher
than
before
i
from
above
such
light
required
as
now
should
once
for
all
destroy
the
folly
which
at
times
desired
a
sanction
for
so
great
a
joy
thenceforth
and
through
that
i
trod
a
path
with
no
suspicions
dim
i
loved
her
in
the
name
of
god
and
for
the
ray
she
was
of
him
i
ought
to
admire
much
more
not
less
her
beauty
was
a
godly
grace
the
mystery
of
loveliness
which
made
an
altar
of
her
face
was
not
of
the
flesh
though
that
was
fair
but
a
most
pure
and
living
light
without
a
name
by
which
the
rare
and
virtuous
spirit
flamed
to
sight
if
oft
in
love
effect
cause
and
cause
effect
vain
to
soar
reasons
to
seek
for
that
which
was
reason
itself
or
something
more
my
joy
was
no
idolatry
upon
the
ends
of
the
vile
earth
bent
for
when
i
loved
her
most
then
i
most
for
more
divine
content
that
other
doubt
which
like
a
ghost
in
the
darkness
haunted
me
was
thus
resolved
him
loved
i
most
but
her
i
loved
most
sensibly
lastly
my
giddiest
hope
no
selfish
thought
or
earthly
smirch
and
forth
i
went
in
peace
and
proud
to
take
my
passion
into
church
grateful
and
glad
to
think
that
all
such
doubts
would
seem
entirely
vain
to
her
whose
lighter
fall
made
no
divorce
of
heart
from
brain
i
found
them
with
exactest
grace
and
fresh
as
spring
for
spring
attired
and
by
the
radiance
in
her
face
i
saw
she
felt
she
was
admired
and
through
the
common
luck
of
love
a
fortunate
delay
to
fit
the
little
lilac
glove
gave
me
her
arm
and
i
and
they
they
true
to
this
and
every
hour
as
if
attended
on
by
time
the
church
while
yet
the
tower
was
noisy
with
the
chime
her
soft
voice
singularly
heard
beside
me
in
her
chant
withstood
the
roar
of
voices
like
a
bird
sole
warbling
in
a
windy
wood
and
when
we
knelt
she
to
be
an
angel
teaching
me
to
pray
and
all
through
the
high
liturgy
my
spirit
rejoiced
without
allay
being
for
once
borne
clearly
above
all
banks
and
bars
of
ignorance
by
this
bright
of
pure
love
and
floated
in
a
free
expanse
whence
it
could
see
from
side
to
side
the
obscurity
from
every
part
away
and
purified
by
the
vibrations
of
my
heart

xi

i
daughter
of
the
gentle
mood

my
love
that
lightly
scans
the
rest
and
does
in
her
accept
all
her
own
faults
but
none
of
as
man
i
can
not
judge
her
ill
or
honour
her
fair
station
less
who
with

errors
still

i

one
i

who
disappoints
my

she
but
know
how
i
admire
or
fail
she
though
from

clear
to

i
call
it
my

so
my

with
reverent
fear
to
err
by

imputes
great

if

like
life
the
sense
which
tells
him
that
the
embrace
of
love
is
a
gulf
of
difference
love
can
not
sound
nor
death
this
i
watching
where
she
danced
native
to
melody
and
light
and
now
and
then
toward
me
glanced
pleased
as
i
hoped
to
please
my
sight
ah
love
to
speak
was
impotent
till
music
did
a
tongue
confer
and
i
knew
what
music
meant
until
i
danced
to
it
with
her
too
proud
of
the
sustaining
power
of
my
till
then
joy
my
passion
for
reproof
that
hour
tasted
alloy
and
bore
me
down
an
eddying
gulf
i
the
world
might
run
to
wreck
so
i
but
once
might
fling
myself
obliviously
about
her
neck
i
her
hand
by
will
or
chance
i
know
not
but
i
saw
the
rays
withdrawn
which
did
till
then
enhance
her
fairness
with
its
thanks
for
praise
i
knew
my
vague
offence
was
patent
to
the
dreaming
eye
and
heavenly
tact
of
innocence
and
did
for
fear
my
fear
defy
and
her
for
the
next
dance
had
not
with
half
the
force
she
was
with
gentleness
and
i
with
measureless
remorse
and
ere
i
slept
on
bended
knee
i
myself
with
many
a
tear
unseasonable
disorderly
and
a
deranger
of
sphere
gave
thanks
that
when
we
stumble
and
fall
we
hurt
ourselves
and
not
the
truth
and
rising
found
its
brightness
all
the
brighter
through
the
tears
of
ruth
nor
was
my
hope
that
night
made
less
though
humbled
and
reproved
her
farewell
did
her
heart
express
as
much
but
not
with
anger
moved
my
trouble
had
my
soul
and
in
the
night
of
my
despair
my
love
a
flower
of
noon
afraid
divulged
its
fulness
unaware
i
saw
she
saw
and
o
sweet
heaven
could
my
glad
mind
have
credited
that
influence
had
to
me
been
given
to
affect
her
so
i
should
have
said
that
though
she
from
herself
felt
delight
and
fancied
harm
they
made
her
face
the
jousting
field
of
joy
and
beautiful
alarm
canto
xii
the
abdication
preludes
i
she
wearies
with
an
ill
unknown
in
sleep
she
sobs
and
seems
to
float
a
all
alone
within
a
lonely
and
as
the
spectral
lies
within
the
gleaming
arms
the
present
shows
her
heedless
eyes
a
future
dim
with
vague
alarms
she
sees
and
yet
she
scarcely
sees
for
not
yet
begun
too
many
are
its
mysteries
for
thought
to
fix
on
any
one
told
that
maidens
are
by
youths
extremely
and
desired
and
sighs
those
sweet
tales
be
truths
what
bliss
to
be
so
much
admired
the
suitors
come
she
sees
them
grieve
her
coldness
fills
them
with
despair
pity
if
she
could
believe
sorry
that
she
can
not
care
but
who
now
meets
her
on
her
way
comes
he
as
enemy
or
friend
or
both
her
bosom
seems
to
say
he
can
not
pass
and
there
an
end
whom
does
he
love
does
he
confer
his
heart
on
worth
that
answers
his
or
is
he
come
to
worship
her
she
fears
she
hopes
she
thinks
he
is
advancing
stepless
quick
and
still
as
in
the
grass
a
serpent
glides
he
fascinates
her
fluttering
will
then
terrifies
with
dreadful
strides
at
first
nothing
to
resist
he
fights
with
all
the
forms
of
peace
he
comes
about
her
like
a
mist
with
subtle
swift
unseen
increase
and
then
for
strikes
amain
some
stroke
that
frightens
her
to
death
and
grows
all
harmlessness
again
ere
she
can
cry
or
get
her
breath
at
times
she
stops
and
stands
at
bay
but
he
in
all
more
strong
than
she
subdues
her
with
his
pale
dismay
or
more
admired
audacity
she
plans
some
final
fatal
blow
but
when
she
means
with
frowns
to
kill
he
looks
as
if
he
loved
her
so
she
smiles
to
him
against
her
will
how
sweetly
he
implies
her
praise
his
tender
talk
his
gentle
tone
the
manly
worship
in
his
gaze
they
nearly
make
her
heart
his
own
with
what
an
air
he
speaks
her
name
his
manner
always
recollects
her
sex
and
still
the
claim
is
taught
its
scope
by
his
respects
her
charms
perceived
to
prosper
first
in
his
beloved
advertencies
when
in
her
glass
they
are
rehearsed
prove
his
most
powerful
allies
ah
whither
shall
a
maiden
flee
when
a
bold
youth
so
swift
pursues
and
siege
of
tenderest
courtesy
with
hope
perseverant
still
renews
why
fly
so
fast
her
breast
thanks
him
who
finds
her
fair
and
good
she
loves
her
fears
joys
arrest
the
foolish
terrors
of
her
blood
by
secret
sweet
degrees
her
heart
takes
warmth
from
his
desire
she
makes
it
more
with
hidden
art
and
fuels
late
dreaded
fire
the
generous
credit
he
accords
to
all
the
signs
of
good
in
her
redeems
itself
his
praiseful
words
the
virtues
they
impute
confer
her
heart
is
thrice
as
rich
in
bliss
three
times
gentler
than
before
he
gains
a
right
to
call
her
his
now
she
through
him
is
so
much
more
heaven
she
turns
her
head
music
when
she
talks
air
on
which
elate
she
seems
to
tread
the
convert
of
a
gladder
sphere
ah
might
he
when
by
doubts
aggrieved
behold
his
tokens
next
her
breast
at
all
his
words
and
sighs
perceived
against
its
blythe
upheaval
but
still
she
flies
should
she
be
won
it
must
not
be
believed
or
thought
she
yields
chased
to
death
undone
surprised
and
violently
caught
ii
the
whose
portentous
shade
fumes
from
a
core
of
fire
his
livery
is
whose
maid
denies
herself
to
his
desire
ah
grief
that
almost
crushes
life
to
lie
upon
his
lonely
bed
and
fancy
her
wife
his
brain
is
flame
his
heart
is
lead
sinking
at
last
by
course
round
with
sleep
from
his
despair
he
does
but
sleep
to
gather
force
that
goes
to
his
exhausted
care
he
wakes
for
all
the
smart
his
only
love
and
she
is
wed
his
fondness
comes
about
his
heart
as
milk
comes
when
the
babe
is
dead
the
wretch
whom
she
found
fit
for
scorn
his
own
allegiant
thoughts
despise
and
far
into
the
shining
morn
lazy
with
misery
he
lies
iii
this
marks
the
churl
when
spousals
crown
his
selfish
hope
he
finds
the
grace
which
sweet
love
has
for
the
clown
was
not
in
the
woman
but
the
chace
the
abdication
from
little
signs
like
little
stars
whose
faint
impression
on
the
sense
the
very
looking
straight
at
mars
or
only
seen
by
confluence
from
instinct
of
a
mutual
thought
whence
sanctity
of
manners
from
chance
unconscious
and
from
what
concealment
overconscious
her
less
weight
upon
my
arm
her
lowlier
mien
that
with
this
i
found
and
felt
with
strange
alarm
i
stood
committed
to
my
bliss
i
grew
assured
before
i
that
be
mine
without
reserve
and
in
her
graces
at
leisure
till
the
time
should
serve
with
just
enough
of
dread
to
thrill
the
hope
and
make
it
trebly
dear
thus
loth
to
speak
the
word
to
kill
either
the
hope
or
happy
fear
till
once
through
lanes
returning
late
her
laughing
sisters
behind
and
ere
we
her
gate
we
paused
with
one
presentient
mind
and
in
the
dim
and
perfumed
mist
their
coming
who
friends
to
me
and
very
women
loved
to
assist
timid
opportunity
twice
rose
twice
died
my
trembling
word
the
faint
and
frail
cathedral
chimes
spake
time
in
music
and
we
heard
the
chafers
rustling
in
the
limes
her
dress
that
me
where
i
stood
the
warmth
of
her
confided
arm
her
gentle
neighbourhood
her
pleasure
in
her
power
to
charm
her
look
her
love
her
form
her
touch
the
least
most
by
blissful
turn
blissful
but
that
it
pleased
too
much
and
taught
the
wayward
soul
to
yearn
it
was
as
if
a
harp
with
wires
was
traversed
by
the
breath
i
drew
and
oh
sweet
meeting
of
desires
she
answering
that
she
loved
too
honoria
was
to
be
my
bride
the
hopeless
heights
of
hope
were
scaled
the
summit
won
i
paused
and
as
if
success
itself
had
it
as
if
my
lips
to
touch
at
reward
and
rashly
on
eden
life
by
the
flaming
sword
the
whole
wealthiest
and
its
best
so
fiercely
sought
when
found
poor
in
its
need
to
be
poor
from
its
very
want
of
bound
my
queen
was
crouching
at
my
side
by
love
unsceptred
and
brought
low
her
awful
garb
of
maiden
pride
all
melted
into
tears
like
snow
the
mistress
of
my
reverent
thought
whose
praise
was
all
i
of
fame
in
my
approval
sought
protection
as
from
danger
and
blame
her
soul
which
late
i
loved
to
invest
with
pity
for
my
poor
desert
buried
its
face
within
my
breast
like
a
pet
fawn
by
hunters
hurt
book
ii
the
prologue
her
sons
pursue
the
butterflies
her
baby
daughter
mocks
the
doves
with
throbbing
coo
in
his
fond
eyes
venus
with
her
little
loves
her
footfall
dignifies
the
earth
her
the
of
grace
and
lo
his
coming
lights
with
mirth
its
court
and
capital
her
face
full
proud
her
favour
makes
her
lord
and
that
her
bosom
knows
she
takes
his
arm
without
a
word
in
lanes
of
laurel
and
of
rose
ten
years
has
she
been
his
he
but
begins
to
understand
he
says
the
dignity
and
bliss
she
gave
him
when
she
gave
her
hand
she
answering
says
he
disenchants
the
past
though
that
was
perfect
he
rejoins
the
present
nothing
wants
but
briefness
to
be
ecstasy
he
lands
her
charms
her
glow
wins
from
the
spoiler
time
new
rays
bright
looks
reply
approving
so
elixir
vitæ
praise
upon
a
beech
he
bids
her
mark
where
ten
years
since
he
carved
her
name
it
grows
there
with
the
growing
bark
and
in
his
heart
it
grows
the
same
for
that
her
soft
arm
presses
his
close
to
her
fond
maternal
breast
he
tells
her
each
new
kindness
is
the
effectual
sum
of
all
the
rest
and
whilst
the
cushat
mocking
they
blest
the
days
they
had
been
wed
at
cost
of
those
in
which
he
till
everything
was

times
said

were
growing
vain
when

here
brought
the
post
down
sole

but
for
once
scarce
at
for

till
this
tenth
festival
kept
close
was
thus
commenced
while

shook
the

married
with
the

of

with
a
roar
in
the
loves
the

a
hedgehog
from
his
pinafore
which
saved
his

and
stared

for

unglobed

and
fell
the

amain
with
shriek
with
laughter
and
with
shout
and
peace
at
last
restored
again
the
bard
who
this
untimely
hitch
bore
with
a
calm
magnanimous
the
hedgehog
rolled
into
a
ditch
and

proceeded

our

the
courage
corporate
that
drags
the
coward
to
heroic
death
too
late
for
song
who
henceforth
sings
must
fledge
his
heavenly
flight
with
more
and
heroic
things
than
hasty
war
while
might
and
right
are
not
agreed
and
battle
thus
is
yet
to
wage
so
long
let
laurels
be
the
meed
of
soldier
as
of
poet
sage
but
men
expect
the
tale
of
love
and
weary
of
the
tale
of
hate
lift
me
o
muse
myself
above
and
let
the
world
no
longer
wait
ii
i
saw
three
cupids
so
i
who
made
three
kites
on
which
were
drawn
in
letters
that
like
roses
and
the
boy
who
held
by
plato
tried
his
airy
venture
first
all
sail
it
till
scarce
descried
then
and
for
want
of
tail
love
with
shouts
of
mirth
that
pride
of
spirit
thus
should
fall
to
his
kite
a
lump
of
earth
and
lo
it
would
not
soar
at
all
last
my
disciple
freighted
his
with
a
long
streamer
made
of
flowers
the
children
of
the
sod
and
this
rose
in
the
sun
and
flew
for
hours
iii
the
music
of
the
sirens
found
ulysses
weak
though
cords
were
strong
but
happier
orpheus
stood
unbound
and
shamed

with
a
sweeter
song

mine
of

ask
may
i
with

pursue
the
sacred
task
of
superseding
faith
by

till
the
witless
gadarene
preferring
christ
to
swine
shall
know
that
life
is
sweetest
when
clean
to
prouder
folly
let
me
show
earth
by
divine
light
made
divine

let
the
saints

hear
my

what
fortune
did
my
heart
foretell
what
shook
my
spirit
as
i
woke
like
the
vibration
of
a
bell
of
which
i
had
not
heard
the
stroke
was
it
some
happy
vision
shut
from
memory
by
the
fresh
ray
was
it
that
song
or
but
a
natural
gratitude
for
day

mere
joy

wayward
ecstasy

i
won

me
along

struck
my

paced

on
her
brows
and
with
a
faint
indignant
flush
and
fainter
smile
she
gave
her
hand

not

sate
apart
as
if
to

drew
humbly

and
for
all
put
it
away
the
faint
flush

thereupon
her
loveliness
which
rather
lay
in
light
than
colour
smiled
and
shone
till
sick
was
all
my
soul
with
bliss

and
now
withdraws
and
flits
about
and
now
looks
forth
again
until
grown
bold
he
hops
on
stool
and
chair
and
now
attains
the
and
now
confides
himself
to
air
the
maiden
so
from
free
sky
in
chaste
and
prudent
counsels
caged
but
longing
to
be
by
her
faith
declared
and
gaged
when
blest
with
that
release
desired
first
doubts
if
truly
she
is
free
then
pauses
restlessly
retired
at
too
much
liberty
but
soon
remembering
all
her
debt
to
plighted
passion
gets
by
rote
her
duty
says
love
him
yet
the
thought
half
chokes
her
in
her
throat
and
like
that
fatal
am
thine
comes
with
alternate
gush
and
check
and
joltings
of
the
heart
as
wine
from
a
flask
of
narrow
neck
is
he
indeed
her
choice
she
fears
her
yes
was
rashly
said
and
shame
remorse
and
ineffectual
tears
revolt
from
has
conceded
claim
oh
treason
so
with
desperate
nerve
she
cries
am
in
love
am
his
lets
run
the
cables
of
reserve
and
floats
into
a
sea
of
bliss
and
laughs
to
think
of
her
alarm
avows
she
was
in
love
before
though
has
avowal
was
the
charm
which
to
her
own
the
door
she
loves
him
for
his
mastering
air
whence
she
slaying
flies
his
flattering
look
which
seems
to
wear
her
loveliness
in
manly
eyes
his
smile
which
by
reverse
portends
an
awful
wrath
should
reason
stir
how
fortunate
it
is
friends
and
he
will
be
wroth
with
her
his
power
to
do
or
guard
from
harm
if
he
but
chose
to
use
it
half
and
catch
her
up
in
one
strong
arm
what
could
she
do
but
weep
or
laugh
his
words
which
still
instruct
but
so
that
this
applause
seems
still
implied
wise
in
all
she
ought
to
know
how
ignorant
of
all
beside
his
skilful
suit
which
leaves
her
free
gives
nothing
for
the
world
to
name
and
keeps
her
conscience
safe
while
he
with
half
the
bliss
takes
all
the
blame
his
clear
repute
with
great
and
small
the
jealousy
his
choice
will
stir
but
ten
times
more
than
ten
times
all
she
loves
him
for
his
love
of
her
how
happy
he
seems
to
see
in
her
that
utter
loveliness
which
she
for
his
sake
longs
to
be
at
times
she
can
not
but
confess
her
other
friends
are
somewhat
blind
her
years
excuse
neglect
but
all
the
rest
are
scarcely
kind
and
brothers
grossly
want
respect
and
oft
she
views
what
he
admires
within
her
glass
and
sight
of
this
makes
all
the
sum
of
her
desires
to
be
devotion
unto
his
but
still
at
first
done
a
touch
her
hand
lightly
she
stands
dizzied
and
like
one
set
sudden
in
the
sea
and
though
her
bond
for
endless
time
to
his
good
pleasure
gives
her
the
slightest
favour
seems
a
crime
because
it
makes
her
love
him
more
but
that
she
will
let
him
know
for
what
were
love
should
reverence
cease
a
thought
which
makes
her
reason
so
inscrutable
it
seems
caprice
with
her
as
with
a
desperate
town
too
weak
to
stand
too
proud
to
treat
the
conqueror
though
the
walls
are
down
has
still
to
capture
street
by
street

after
that
habitual
faith
divorced
from

walks
nobly
in
its
novel
path

changed
allegiance

near

held
the

heard

of

sang
my
verses

word
by
music
taught
its
latent
life
with
interludes
of
notes
that
surprising
and
serene
as
meteor

was
a
passion

of

beautiful
than

her
sometime

mist

form

warmth

motion

the
chosen
eye

who

she
could
divine
the
halo

the
happy
trance

her
bright
arm
reposed
on
mine
in

pauses

could

took
my

worn

tacks

tries
short
cuts
gets
praise
and
a

here
i
in
sheer
despair

what
was

loosed

as

make
pause

swoon
through

sick
the
soul
its
wingless

the

now
the

sharp
jealousies

grow
and
grow
till
silence
and
the
darkness
ache
he
sees
her
step
so
proud
and
gay
which
ere
he
spake
foretold
despair
thus
did
she
look
on
such
a
day
and
such
the
fashion
of
her
hair
and
thus
she
stood
when
kneeling
low
he
took
the
bramble
from
her
dress
and
thus
she
and
whose
was
sweeter
than
he
feeds
on
thoughts
that
most
deject
he
impudently
feigns
her
charms
so
reverenced
in
his
own
respect
dreadfully
by
other
arms
and
turns
and
puts
his
brows
that
ache
against
the
pillow
where
cold
if
only
now
his
heart
would
break
but
oh
how
much
a
heart
can
hold
ii
you
loved
her
and
would
lie
all
night
thinking
how
beautiful
she
was
and
what
to
do
for
her
delight
now
both
are
bound
with
alien
laws
be
patient
put
your
heart
to
school
weep
if
you
will
but
not
despair
the
trust
that
nought
goes
wrong
by

should
ease

load

many

love

shall
meet
his
dues

the

so
sweetly
dancing
on
the
grass
to
music
with
its
ups
and
downs
such
work

just
the
busy
times
of

quite
like

she
went
up
made
bold
to
peep
into
the
rose

and
cried
charming
all
quite
new
and
who
it
could
be
for
all
but
miss
honor
in
too
but
too
proud
to
peep
and
pry
like
that
sweet
miss
honor
sir
excuse
my
humbleness
but
i
pray
get
a

thought
that
dreary
room
had
old
vaughan
with
fright
she
would
not
sleep
in
such
a
tomb
for
all
her
host
was
worth
a

sir
they
the

but
though
they
smiled
and
to

no

could
see
how
miss

nurse
this
is
not
my
affair
the
ladies
in

with
cause
and
thank
you
for
your
i
through
the
vacant
house
soon
to
be
in
one
room
of
old
my
here
my
vows
of
endless
thanks
were
oftenest
paid
this
room
its
first
condition
kept
for
on
her
road
to
sarum
town
therein
an
english
queen
had
slept
before
the
hurst
was
half
down
the
pictured
walls
the
place
became
here
ran
the
brook
anaurus
where
stout
jason
bore
the
wrinkled
dame
whom
serving
changed
to
juno
there
selfish
hope
instead
of
the
nuptial
goddess
a
cloud
and
here
translated
psyche
fed
her
gaze
on
love
not
and
in
this
chamber
had
she
been
and
into
that
she
would
not
look
my
joy
my
vanity
my
queen
at
whose
dear
name
my
pulses
shook
to
others
how
express
at
all
my
worship
in
that
joyful
shrine
i
scarcely
can
myself
recall
what
peace
and
ardour
then
were
mine
and
how
more
sweet
than
aught
below
the
daylight
and
its
duties
done
it
felt
to
fold
the
hands
and
so
relinquish
all
regards
but
one
to
see
her
features
in
the
dark
to
lie
and
meditate
once
more
the
grace
i
did
not
fully
mark
the
tone
i
had
not
heard
before
and
from
my
pillow
then
to
take
her
notes
her
picture
and
her
glove
put
there
for
joy
when
i
should
wake
and
press
them
to
the
heart
of
love
and
then
to
whisper
and
pray
to
live
so
long
as
not
to
miss
that
unimaginable
day
which
farther
seems
the
nearer
and
still
from
well
to
drink
in
dreams
while
on
her
brows
of
innocence
ineffable
the
laughing
bridal
rose
canto
vi
the
preludes
i
how
strange
a
thing
a
lover
seems
to
animals
that
do
not
love
lo
where
he
walks
and
talks
in
dreams
and
flouts
us
with
his
glove
how
foreign
is
the
garb
he
wears
and
how
his
great
devotion
mocks
our
poor
propriety
and
scares
the
undevout
with
paradox
his
soul
through
scorn
of
worldly
care
and
great
extremes
of
sweet
and
gall
and
musing
much
on
all
fair
grows
witty
and
fantastical
he
sobs
his
joy
and
sings
his
grief
and
evermore
finds
such
delight
in
simply
picturing
his
relief
that
seems
to
cure
his
plight
he
makes
his
sorrow
when
none
his
fancy
blows
both
cold
and
hot
next
to
the
wish
that
be
won
his
first
hope
is
that
she
may
not
he
sues
yet
deprecates
consent
would
she
be
captured
she
must
fly
she
looks
too
happy
and
content
for
whose
least
pleasure
he
would
die
oh
cruelty
she
can
not
care
for
one
to
whom
always
kind
he
says
nought
but
oh
despair
if
not
jove
to
her
fond
mind
jealous
if
she
pets
a
dove
she
must
be
his
with
all
her
soul
yet
a
postulate
in
love
that
part
is
greater
than
the
whole
and
all
his
stress
when
with
her
regards
her
hair
her
hand
a
ribbon
of
her
dress
as
if
his
life
were
only
there
because
constant
he
will
change
and
kindest
glances
coldly
meet
and
all
the
time
he
seems
so
strange
his
soul
is
fawning
at
her
feet
of
smiles
and
simple
heaven
grown
tired
he
wickedly
provokes
her
tears
and
when
she
weeps
as
he
desired
falls
slain
with
ecstasies
of
fears
he
blames
her
though
she
has
no
fault
except
the
folly
to
be
his
he
worships
her
the
more
to
exalt
the
profanation
of
a
kiss
his
disease
never
well
but
when
his
paleness
shames
her
rose
his
a
citadel
its
sign
a
flag
that
each
way
blows
his
fancy
frets
and
fumes
and
love
in
him
is
fierce
like
hate
and
ruffles
his
ambrosial
plumes
against
the
bars
of
time
and
fate
ii
power
of
samson
the
mighty
solomon
the
wise
and
holy
david
all
must
doff
their
crowns
to
love
for
none
but
fell
as
love
would
scorn
to
fall
and
what
may
fallen
spirits
win
when
stripes
and
precepts
can
not
move
only
the
sadness
of
all
sin
when
at
in
the
light
of
love
the
ask
will
admiration
halt
should
spots
appear
within
my
sun
oh
how
i
wish
i
knew
your
fault
for
tired
gaze
to
rest
upon
your
graces
which
have
made
me
great
will
i
so
loftily
admire
yourself
yourself
shall
emulate
and
be
yourself
your
own
desire
nobly
mirror
you
too
fair
and
when
false
to
me
your
glass
wanting
by
that
repair
so
bring
yourself
through
me
to
pass
o
dearest
tell
me
how
to
prove
goodwill
which
can
not
be
the
beneficial
heart
of
love
is
labour
in
an
idle
breast
name
in
the
world
your
chosen
part
and
here
i
vow
with
all
the
bent
and
application
of
my
heart
to
give
myself
to
your
content
would
you
live
on
thus
not
proudly
high
nor
poorly
low
indeed
the
lines
are
to
us
in
pleasant
places
be
it
so
but
would
you
others
move
by
sight
not
faith
while
you
they
admire
help
with
zeal
as
i
approve
that
just
and
merciful
desire
high
as
the
lonely
moon
to
view
lift
your
light
do
you
decree
your
place
win
it
for
from
you
command
inspires
capacity
or
unseen
would
you
sway
the
world
more
surely
then
in
gracious
rhyme
raise
your
emblem
fair
with
blessing
in
the
breeze
of
time
faith
removes
mountains
much
more
love
let
your
contempt
abolish
me
if
ought
of
your
devisal
prove
too
hard
or
high
to
do
or
i
ended
your
sir
said
nurse
man
brings
it
i
could
have
both
him
and
her
give
him
that
with
how
beat
my
heart
how
paused
my
breath
when
with
perversely
fond
delay
i
broke
the
seal
that
bore
a
wreath
of
roses
with
one
of
bay
found
your
note
how
very
kind
to
leave
it
there
i
can
not
tell
how
pleased
i
was
or
how
you
find
words
to
express
your
thoughts
so
well
the
girls
are
going
to
the
ball
at
wilton
if
you
can
come
and
any
day
this
week
you
call
papa
and
i
shall
be
at
home
you
said
to
mary
hope
in
women
be
vain
on
saturday
your
friend
her
pope
the
bishop
dined
with
us
again
she
put
the
question
if
they
ought
he
it
cleverly
away
for
giddy
mildred
cried
she
thought
we
with
we
must
we
papa
and
said
sad
to
think
how
vain
his
girls
would
be
above
all
mary
now
she
had
episcopal
authority
but
i
was
very
dull
dear
friend
and
went
upstairs
at
last
and
cried
be
sure
to
come
or
send
a
on
either
side
adieu
i
am
not
well
last
night
my
dreams
were
wild
i
often
woke
the
was
so
bright
and
when
it
i
thought
you
canto
vii
the
revulsion
preludes
i
and
can
ought
compared
with
wedlock
be
for
use
but
he
who
made
the
heart
to
use
proportions
joy
what
he
has
let
no
man
put
apart
sweet
order
has
its
draught
of
bliss
graced
with
the
pearl
of
consent
ten
times
delightful
in
that
considerate
and
innocent
in
vain
disorder
grasps
the
cup
the
not
but
spilt
and
if
he
stoops
to
lick
it
up
it
only
tastes
of
earth
and
guilt
his
sorry
raptures
rest
destroys
to
live
like
comets
they
must
roam
on
settled
poles
turn
solid
joys
and
sunlike
pleasures
shine
at
home
ii
was
tears
thy
loss
thy
wife
in
what
was
she
particular
others
of
comely
face
and
life
others
as
chaste
and
warm
there
are
and
when
they
speak
they
seem
to
sing
beyond
her
sex
she
was
not
wise
and
there
is
no
more
common
thing
than
kindness
in
a
eyes
then
wherefore
weep
so
long
and
fast
why
so
exceedingly
repine
say
how
has
thy
beloved
so
much
all
others
was
the
revulsion
when
the
spousal
time
of
may
hangs
all
the
hedge
with
bridal
wreaths
and
so
sweet
the
bosom
gay
give
thanks
for
every
breath
it
breathes
when
like
to
like
is
gladly
moved
and
each
thing
joins
in
refrain
those
love
now
who
never
loved
let
those
who
have
loved
love
again
that
i
in
whom
the
sweet
time
wrought
lay
within
a
lonely
glade
to
delicious
thought
beneath
the
softly
twinkling
shade
the
leaves
all
stirring
well
a
neighbouring
rush
of
rivers
cold
and
as
the
sun
or
shadow
fell
so
these
were
green
and
those
were
gold
in
dim
recesses
hyacinths
and
breadths
of
primrose
lit
the
air
which
wandering
through
the
woodland
and
perfumes
here
and
there
upon
the
spray
the
squirrel
swung
and
careless
songsters
six
or
seven
sang
lofty
songs
the
leaves
among
fit
for
their
only
listener
heaven
i
bliss
gains
nothing
by
becoming
more
millions
have
meaning
after
this
cyphers
forget
the
and
so
i
mused
till
musing
brought
a
dream
that
shook
my
house
of
clay
and
in
my
humbled
heart
i
thought
to
me
there
yet
may
come
a
day
with
this
the
single
vestige
seen
of
comfort
earthly
or
divine
my
sorrow
some
time
must
have
been
her
portion
had
it
not
been
mine
then
i
who
knew
from
watching
life
that
blows
foreseen
are
slow
to
fall
rehearsed
the
losing
of
a
wife
and
faced
its
terrors
each
and
all
the
fancy
the
coffin
with
its
ghastly
breath
the
innocent
sweet
face
that
owed
none
of
its
innocence
to
death
the
lips
that
used
to
laugh
the
knell
that
bade
the
world
beware
of
mirth
the
heartless
and
intolerable
indignity
of
to
earth
at
morn
remembering
by
degrees
that
she
i
about
was
dead
still
recurrent
jubilees
the
days
that
she
was
born
won
wed
the
duties
of
my
life
the
same
their
meaning
for
the
feelings
gone
friendship
impertinent
and
fame
disgusting
and
more
harrowing
none
small
household
troubles
to
me
as
time
would
i
dine
and
oh
how
could
i
bear
to
see
the
noisy
children
at
their
play
besides
where
all
things
limp
and
halt
could
i
go
straight
should
i
alone
have
kept
my
love
without
default
at
the
true
and
heavenly
tone
the
might
come
to
mind
that
the
gift
which
more
endears
the
hour
which
might
have
been
more
kind
and
now
less
fertile
in
vain
tears
the
good
of
common
intercourse
for
daintier
pleasures
then
despised
now
with
what
passionate
remorse
what
poignancy
of
hunger
prized
the
little
wrong
now
greatly
rued
which
no
repentance
now
could
right
and
love
in
disbelieving
mood
deserting
his
celestial
height
withal
to
know
love
sent
grief
to
make
me
less
the
and
more
ah
the
sick
relief
why
i
not
my
heart
before
i
exclaimed
with
chill
alarm
this
fantastic
horror
shows
the
feature
of
an
actual
harm
and
coming
straight
to
sarum
close
as
one
who
dreams
his
wife
is
dead
and
can
not
in
his
slumber
weep
and
moans
upon
his
wretched
bed
and
wakes
and
finds
her
there
asleep
and
laughs
and
sighs
so
i
not
less
relieved
beheld
with
blissful
start
the
light
and
happy
loveliness
which
lay
so
heavy
on
my
heart
canto
viii
the
preludes
i
if
capricious
be
so
but
if
his
duties
constant
are
she
lets
her
loving
favour
glow
as
steady
as
a
tropic
star
appears
there
nought
for
which
to
weep
weep
for
nought
for
his
dear
sake
she
clasps
her
sister
in
her
sleep
her
love
in
dreams
is
most
awake
her
soul
that
once
with
pleasure
shook
did
any
eyes
her
beauty
own
now
wonders
how
they
dare
to
look
on
what
belongs
to
him
alone
the
indignity
of
taking
gifts
exhilarates
her
loving
breast
a
rapture
of
submission
lifts
her
life
into
celestial
rest
nothing
left
of
what
she
was
back
to
the
babe
the
woman
dies
and
all
the
wisdom
that
she
has
is
to
love
him
for
being
wise
confident
because
she
fears
and
though
discreet
when
away
if
none
but
her
dear
despot
hears
she
prattles
like
a
child
at
play
perchance
when
all
her
praise
is
said
he
tells
the
news
a
battle
won
on
either
side
ten
thousand
dead
she
says
but
if
known
she
thinks
looking
on
my
face
i
am
his
joy
i
do
he
sees
such
grace
in
that
have
me
always
so
and
evermore
for
sake
to
the
sweet

joins

cunning
of

deceit
and
what
she
thinks
from
what

although
never

lies
far
as
scotland
from

without
his

he
was
won
against
his

kept
devout
never

him
how
done
and
he
will
never

it
out

sudden
he
suspects
her

hears
her
forging
chain
and
trap
and
looks
she
sits
in
simple
smiles
her
two

lying

her

what
lifts
her
in

beyond
all
else
let
love
not
err
that
which
all
right
women
are
but
which
know
in
none
but
her
she
is
to
me
the
only
ark
of
that
high
mystery
which
locks
the
lips
of
joy
or
speaks
in
dark
enigmas
and
in
paradox
that
potent
charm
which
none
can
fly
nor

which
makes
me

juno

i

a

i
see
a
bright
circumference
of

but
darkness
where
the
sun
should
be
fills
admiration
with
amaze
and
when
for
relief
i
think
to
fathom
with
the
line
of

the
well
from
which
i
blissful
drink
the
so
deep
i
come
to

iii
saw
you
take
his

strictly
kept
he
thought
me
asleep
at

i
knew
he
thought
i
thought
he
thought
i
the
hard
virtues
highly
wrought
but
let
my
gentle
mistress
be
in
every
look
word
deed
and
thought
nothing
but
sweet
and
womanly
her
virtues
please
my
virtuous
mood
but
what
at
all
times
i
admire
is
not
that
she
is
wise
or
good
but
just
the
thing
which
i
desire
with
versatility
to
sing
the
theme
of
love
to
any
strain
if
she
is
anything
be
it
careless
talkative
and
vain
that
seems
in
her
supremest
grace
which
virtue
or
not
apprises
me
that
my
familiar
thoughts
embrace
unfathomable
i
thus
for
she
desired
to
know
what
mind
i
most
approved
partly
to
learn
what
she
inquired
partly
to
get
the
praise
she
loved
i
praised
her
but
no
praise
could
fill
the
depths
of
her
desire
to
please
though
dull
to
others
as
a
will
to
them
that
have
no
legacies
the
more
i
praised
the
more
she
shone
her
eyes
incredulously
bright
and
all
her
happy
beauty
blown
beneath
the
beams
of
my
delight
sweet
rivalry
was
thus
begot
by
turns
my
speech
in

with
flatteries
the

and
she
them
with
her
smile
have
my
heart
so
sweetly
and
i
confess
nay
my
pride
that
with
you
so
solely

how
should
i

how

i
felt
the

he
once

was
when
either
in
his

his
own
deserts
with
joy
admired
we
took
one
side
in
like
hopes
pursued
with
equal
thirst
were
by
fate
seventh
from

and
either
loved
a
laugh
more
than
all

he
and
i
were
perfect
in
the
pleasant
half
of
universal
charity
from
pride
of

thus
i
loved
him
and
he
me
till
love
begot
the
lowliness
which
now
approved
nothing
but
that
which
i
was
not
blest
was
the
pride
of
feeling
so
subjected
to
a
soft
reign
she
was
my
vanity
and
oh
all
other
vanities
how
vain
frank
in
his
track
and
set
my
guilty
heart
at
ease
by
echoing
my
excuses
back
with
just
the
same
apologies
so
he
had
slighted
me
as
well
nor
was
my
mind
less
when
what
i
sought
excuse
to
tell
he
of
himself
did
first
confess
each
rapturous
praised
his
worth
he
eloquently
thus

the
sweetness
of
the
earth
her
soul
the

grace
to
which
she
leads
me

briefly
all

say
to
you
who
briefly
understand
she
is
both
heaven
and
the
way
displeasures
and
resentments
pass
athwart
her
charitable
eyes
more
fleetingly
than
breath
from
glass
or
truth
from
foolish
memories
her
so
with
woes
she
has
no
need
of
chastisement
her
gentle
conditions
close
like
commandments
with
content
and
make
an
aspect
calm
and
gay
where
sweet

come

stood
for

how
a
man
must
love
his

no

than
christ
did
love
his

if
need
be
giving
her
his

then
the
mutual
vow

slept
well
for
us
heaven
asks
not
how
we
take
this
oath
but
how
kept
o
bold
seal
of
a
bashful
bound
which
makes
the

this

is
all
i

yours

i

more
than

you
can

wakes
when

above
the
prejudice

microscopic
for

fear
comes
at

soon
rejoiced

your

shakes
but
none
removes
her
strength
is
your
esteem
beware
of
finding
fault
her
by
blame
from
you
be
despair
but
praise
that
is
not
quite
will
all
her
noble
nature
move
to
make
your
utmost
wishes
tree
yet
think
while
mending
thus
your
love
of
snatching
her
ideal
too
the
death
of

keep
your

in
your

keep
to
the
very
height
your
oath
and
honour
her
with
arduous
life

no

flurried
now
ready
off
at

for

sought
to
keep
shy
love
in
countenance
but
whilst
i
vainly
my
thought
her
voice
mime
from

is
not
this
a
pretty
shawl

husband
and
wife
preludes
i
married
why
having
won
her
do
i
woo
because
her
vestal
grace
provokes
me
always
to
pursue
but
eludes
embrace
because
her
womanhood
is
such
that
as
on
subjects
kiss
the
hand
yet
so
near
a
touch
affirms
no
mean
familiarness
nay
rather
marks
more
fair
the
height
which
can
with
safety
so
neglect
to
dread
as
lower
ladies
might
that
grace
could
meet
with
disrespect
thus
she
with
happy
favour
feeds
allegiance
from
a
love
so
high
that
thence
no
false
conceit
proceeds
of
difference
bridged
or
state
put
by
because
although
in
act
and
word
as
lowly
as
a
wife
can
be
her
manners
when
they
call
me
lord
remind
me
by
courtesy
not
with
her
least
consent
of
will
which
would
my
proud
affection
hurt
but
by
the
noble
style
that
still
imputes
an
desert
because
her
gay
and
lofty
brows
when
all
is
won
which
hope
can
ask
reflect
a
light
of
hopeless
snows
that
bright
in
virgin
ether
bask
because
though
free
of
the
outer
court
i
am
this
temple
keeps
its
shrine
sacred
to
heaven
because
in
short
not
and
never
can
be
mine

friendship

well
but
misses
reach
and
wearies
in
its
best
delight
with
the
vanities
of
speech
too
long
regarded
roses
even
afflict
the
mind
with
fond
unrest
and
to
converse
direct
within
heaven
is
oft
a
labour
in
the
breast
the
soul

the
banquet

fatigues
at
last
with
vain
desires
or
sickens
by
satiety

the
music
from
the

of

her
feet
by
of

in

left
shapely

with

she
loaded

the

then
at
her

i
a

to
take
her
to
the
at

each
a

black
in
the

miles
from

the

the

lifting

and

my

with
light
fear
smiling
at
itself
and
dashing
past

asleep
upon

after

cruise
in

for

my
bride
was
placed
within
the
chair
the
red
flag
about
her
feet
and
so
swung
laughing
through
the
air
love
she
said
frederick
graham
my
cousin
whom
you
met
you
know
and
seeing
us
the
brave
man
came
and
made
his
frank
and
courteous
bow
and
gave
my
hand
a
shake
and
said
me
to
the
hurst
i
never
thought
my
luck
would
make
your
wife
and
you
my
guests
the
and
honor
cruel
did
we
have
you
not
lately
changed
your
ship
commander
now
said
he
with
a
slight
quiver
of
the
lip
we
saw
the
vessel
shown
with
pride
took
luncheon
i
must
eat
his
salt
parting
he
said
i
fear
my
bride
found
him
unselfish
to
a
fault
his
wish
he
saw
had
come
to
pass
and
so
indeed
her
face
that
that
should
be
whatever
which
made
his
cousin
happiest
we
left
him
looking
from
above
rich
bankrupt
for
he
could
afford
to
say
most
proudly
that
his
love
was
virtue
and
its
own
reward
but
others
loved
as
well
as
he
thought
i
and
if
fate
unfair
had
only
me
as
hapless
i
had
been
as
great
as
souls
ambitious
but
if
raised
past
hope
by
luck
or
wit
all
pride
of
place
will
proudly
scorn
and
live
as
been
used
to
it
so
we
two
wore
our
strange
estate
familiar
unaffected
free
we
until
the
dusk
grew
late
of
this
and
that
but
after
tea
as
doubtful
if
a
lot
so
sweet
as
ours
was
ours
in
very
sooth
like
children
to
promote
conceit
we
that
it
was
not
the
truth
and
she
assumed
the
maiden
coy
and
i
adored
remorseless
charms
and
then
we
our
hands
for
joy
and
ran
into
each
others
arms
the
epilogue
i
dearest
wife
a
fire
sends
forth
to
heaven
great
shows
of
fume
and
watchers
far
away
admire
but
when
the
flames
their
power
assume
the
more
they
burn
the
less
they
show
the
clouds
no
longer
smirch
the
sky
and
then
the
flames
intensest
glow
when
watchers
think
they
die
the
fumes
of
early
love
my
verse
has
must
paint
the
flame
merit
the
promethean
curse
but
now
sweet
for
your
praise
and
speak
too
boldly
veils
are
due
to
not
this
women
will
vow
i
say
not
true
and
men
believe
thine
lips
they
i
did
not
call
you
or
think
till
after
frank
was
fault
i
can
not
well
remove
the
frank
now
blew
his
horn
and
walter
on
hands
and
knees
at
baby
in
the
mignonette
and
all
made
for
the
trees
where
felix
and
his
wife
were
set
again
crickets
have
cares
true
to
their
annual
use
they
rose
to
offer
thanks
at
evening
prayers
in
three
times
sacred
sarum
close
passing
they
left
a
gift
of
wine
at
widow
her
daughter
said
sinking
for
a
sign
she
cried
just
now
of
him
dead
somewhere
close
above
weeping
and
wailing
his
dead
wife
with
forceful
prayers
and
fatal
love
conjuring
me
to
come
to
life
a
spirit
is
terrible
though
dear
it
comes
by
night
and
sucks
my
breath
and
draws
me
with
desire
and
ah
soon
be
his
in
death
vaughan
when
his
kind
eyes
were
dry
said
thought
crosses
me
my
dove
if
heaven
should
proffer
when
we
die
some
superior
love
how
take
the
exchange
without
despair
without
worse
folly
how
refuse
but
she
who
wise
as
she
was
fair
for
subtle
doubts
had
simple
clues
said
sanctifies
and
faith
is
more
than
joy
ah
how
desire
in
any
heaven
a
different
path
though
found
at
first
it
had
been
higher
yet
love
makes
death
a
dreadful
thought
felix
at
what
a
price
we
live
but
present
pleasures
soon
forgot
the
dread
alternative
for
as
became
the
festal
time
he
her
heart
with
tender
praise
and
speeches
wanting
only
rhyme
to
make
them
like
his
winged
lays
he
discommended
girlhood
for
sweetness
like
the
wife
whose
customary
love
is
not
her
passion
or
her
play
but
life
with
beauties
so
maturely
fair
affecting
mild
and
manifold
may
girlish
charms
mo
more
compare
than
apples
green
with
apples
gold
ah
still
unpraised
honoria
heaven
when
you
into
my
arms
it
gave
left
nought
hereafter
to
be
given
but
grace
to
feel
the
good
i
her
own
and
modesty
made
dumb
her
love
but
on
their
road
his
hand
in
hers
felt
soft
reply
and
like
rejoinder
found
and
when
the
carriage
set
them
down
strange
said
he
seem
to
meet
when
pacing
as
we
now
this
town
a
florence
or
a
lisbon
street
that
laura
or
that
catherine
who
in
the
remote
romantic
years
from
petrarch
or
camoens
drew
their
songs
and
their
immortal
tears
but
here
their
converse
had
its
end
for
crossing
the
cathedral
lawn
there
came
an
ancient
who
introduced
to
vaughan
lifted
his
hat
and
and
smiled
and
her
kind
large
eyes
with
joy
by
patting
on
the
cheek
her
child
with
he
yours
