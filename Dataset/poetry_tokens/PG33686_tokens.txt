i

i
knew
not
who
most
beautiful
and
good
and
true
yet
sad
through
suffering
with
brow
soft
eyes
and
voice
so
white
she
haunts
me
now
and
when
and
where
at
night
in
dreamland
she
led
me
athwart
a
lea
where
trammeled
puckered
pansy
and
the
pea
spread
stains
of
poppies
rinced
of
rain
so
gorged
with
sun
their
hurt
hearts
ached
with
pain
heaped
honeysuckles
roses
lavishing
beams
wherein
i
knew
were
huddled
little
dreams
which
laughed
coy
hidden
merriment
and
there
blew
quick
gay
kisses
fragrancing
the
air
and
where
a
river
bubbled
through
the
sward
a
mist
lay
sleepily
and
it
was
hard
to
see
whence
sprung
it
to
what
seas
it
led
how
broadly
spread
and
what
it
was
it
fled
so
ceasless
in
its
sighs
and
bickering
on
into
romance
or
some
bewildering
dawn
of
wisest
legend
from
the
storied
wells
of
lost
baranton
where
old
merlin
dwells
nodding
a
white
poll
and
a
grand
gray
beard
as
if
some
lake
ladyé
he
listening
heard
who
spake
like
water
danced
like
careful
showers
with
blown
gold
curls
thro
drifts
of
flowers
loose
lazy
arms
in
graceful
movement
tossed
float
down
a
woodland
vista
lost
in
some
peculiar
note
that
wrings
a
tear
slow
down
his
withered
cheek
and
then
steals
near
her
sweet
lascivious
brow
white
wonderment
and
gray
rude
eyes
and
hair
which
hath
the
scent
of
the
wildwood
brécéliand
perfumes
in
brittany
and
in
it
one
red
thrust
deep
and
so
sweet
viviane
all
the
glad
leaves
lisp
like
a
young
soft
rain
from
top
to
top
until
a
running
surge
the
dark
solitude
will
urge
that
shakes
and
sounds
and
stammers
as
from
sleep
some
giant
were
aroused
and
with
a
leap
a
creature
glossy
white
showers
mocking
kisses
fast
and
like
a
light
beat
by
a
gust
to
flutter
and
then
done
from
brécéliande
and
merlin
she
is
gone
but
still
he
sits
there
drowsing
with
his
dreams
a
wondrous
cohort
hath
he
many
as
gleams
that
stab
the
moted
mazes
of
a
beech
and
each
grave
dream
hath
its
own
magic
speech
to
sting
to
tears
his
old
eyes
heavy
two
hang
tangled
brilliants
in
his
beard
like
dew
and
still
faint
murmurs
of
courts
brave
and
fair
and
forms
of
arthur
and
proud
guenevere
grave
tristram
and
rare
isoud
and
stout

dark
of

weak

strong
glares
up
with
then
the
instant
fostered
blossoms
die
again
a
roar
of
tournament
a
rippling
stir
of
silken
lists
that
ramble
into
her
that
white
beauty
viviane
the
vast
brécéliande
and
dreams
again
then
dagonet
king
arthur
fool
trips
there
a
waggish
cunning
glittering
on
his
hair
a
tinsel
crown
and
then
will
slightly
sway
thick
leaves
and
part
and
there
morgane
the
fay
with
haughty
wicked
eyes
and
lovely
face
studies
him
steady
for
a
little
space
i
thou
askest
with
thy
studious
eyes
again
here
where
the
restless
forest
hears
the
main
toss
in
a
troubled
sleep
and
moan
ah
sweet
with
joy
and
passion
the
kind
hour
replete
and
what
wild
beauty
here
where
roughly
run
huge
forest
shadows
from
the
westering
sun
the
wood
a
subdued
power
gentle
as
yon
tame
that
in
the
moss
and
grass
gaze
with
their
human
eyes
here
grow
the
lines
of
green
and
where
yon
fountain
shines
urned
in
its
tremulous
ferns
rest
we
upon
this
of
god
thunder
overthrown
years
years
agone
not
where
is
rotted
brown
but
where
the
thick
bark
firm
and
overgrown
of
clambering
ivy
blackly
berried
where
wild
musk
of
wood
decay
just
tincts
the
air
as
if
some
strange
shrub
on
some
whispering
way
in
some
dewed
dell
while
dreaming
of
one
may
in
longing
languor
weakly
tried
to
wake
one
sometime
blossom
and
could
only
make
ghosts
of
such
dead
aromas
as
it
knew
and
shape
a
specter
budding
thin
as
dew
to
haunt
these
sounding
miles
of
solitude
troubled
thou
askest
morgane
and
the
mood
unfathomed
in
thine
eyes
glows
rash
and
deep
as
that
in
some
found
on
sleep
by
some
lost
knight
upon
a
precipice
whom
he
hath
wakened
with
a
laughing
kiss
as
that
of
some
frail
elfin
lady
white
as
if
of
watery
moonbeams
filmy
dight
who
waves
diaphanous
beauty
on
some
cliff
that
drowsing
purrs
with
pines
but
if
the
lone
knight
follow
foul
fiends
rise
and
drag
him
crashing
down
while
she
tall
on
the
crag
triumphant
mocks
him
with
glad
sorcery
till
all
the
wildwood
echoes
shout
with
glee
as
that
bewildering
mystery
of
a
tarn
some
mountain
water
which
the
mornings
scorn
to
anadem
with
fire
and
leave
gray
to
which
some
champion
cometh
when
the
day
hath
tired
of
breding
on
his
proud
young
head
blooms
and
golden
chapletéd
sits
rosy
trembling
with
full
love
for
night
who
cometh
sandaled
dark
in
crape
the
light
of
her
good
eyes
a
marvel
her
vast
hair
tortuous
with
stars
as
in
some
shadowy
lair
the
eyes
of
hunted
wild
things
burn
with
rage
and
on
large
bosoms
doth
his
love
assuage
he
coming
thither
in
that
haunted
place
stoops
low
to
quaff
cool
waters
when
his
face
meets
gurgling
fairy
faces
in
a
ring
that
jostle
upward
babbling
beckoning
him
deep
to
wonders
secret
built
of
old
by
some
dim
witch
city
walled
with
gold
with
beryl
battlements
and
paved
with
pearls
slim
lambent
towers
wrought
of
foamy
swirls
of
alabaster
and
that
witch
to
love
more
beautiful
to
love
than
queens
above
he
pauses
troubled
but
a
wizard
power
in
all
his
bronzen
harness
that
mad
hour
plunges
him
whither
what
if
he
should
miss
those
cloudy
beauties
and
that
creature
kiss
ah
morgane
that
same
power
accolon
saw
potent
in
thine
eyes
and
it
hath
drawn
him
deep
to
plunge
and
to
what
breathless
fate
bliss
which
too
true
he
hath
well
quaffed
of
late
but
there
may
come
what
death
with
bony
claws
to
clutch
away
his
breath
and
make
him
loveless
to
those
eyes
alas
fain
must
i
speak
that
vision
thus
it
was
in
sleep
one
plucked
me
some
warm
larger
than
those
of
earth
and
i
might
see
their
woolly
gold
loose
webby
woven
thro
like
fluffy
flames
spun
gauzy
with
fine
dew
and
i
murmured
then
sure
the
eden
amaranths
so
angel
pure
that
these
alone
may
pluck
them
aye
and
aye
but
with
that
giving
lo
she
passed
away
beyond
me
on
some
misty
yearning
brook
with
some
sweet
song
which
all
the
wild
air
took
with
torn
farewells
and
pensive
melody
touching
to
tears
strange
hopeless
utterly
so
merciless
sweet
that
i
yearned
high
to
tear
those
and
lilies
fair
yet
over
me
a
horror
which
restrained
with
melancholy
presence
of
two
pained
and
awful
mighty
eyes
that
cowed
and
held
me
weeping
while
that
sad
dirge
died
or
swelled
far
far
on
endless
waters
borne
away
a
wild
bird
musick
smitten
when
the
ray
of
dawn
it
burned
for
graced
its
drooping
head
and
the
pale
glory
strengthened
round
it
dead
daggered
of
thorns
it
plunged
on
blind
in
night
the
slow
blood
ruby
on
its
plumage
white
then
then
i
knew
these
blooms
which
she
had
given
were
strays
of
parting
grief
and
waifs
of
heaven
for
tears
and
memories
too
delicate
for
eyes
of
earth
such
souls
immaculate
but
then
my
god
my
god
thus
these
were
left
i
knew
then
still
but
of
that
song
bereft
that
rapturous
wonder
grasping
after
grief
beyond
all
thought
weak
thought
that
would
be
thief
and
bowed
and
wept
into
his
hands
and
she
sorrowful
beheld
and
resting
at
her
knee
raised
slow
her
oblong
lute
and
smote
its
chords
but
ere
the
impulse
saddened
into
words
said
and
didst
love
me
as
thy
lips
have
spake
no
visions
wrought
of
sleep
might
such
love
shake
fast
is
all
love
in
fastness
of
his
power
with
flame
reverberant
moated
stands
his
tower
not
so
built
as
to
chink
from
fact
a
beam
of
doubt
and
much
less
of
a
doubt
from
dream
the
alchemic
fires
of
love
desires
which
hug
this
like
a
snake
melt
to
gold
wires
to
chord
the
old
lyre
new
whereon
he
lyres
so
ceased
and
then
sad
softness
in
her
eye
sang
to
his
dream
a
questioning
reply
will
love
grow
less
when
dead
the
roguish
spring
who
from
gay
eyes
sowed
violets
whispering
peach
petals
in
wild
cheeks
of
withering
grief
laid
lovely
the
dew
will
love
grow
less
will
love
grow
less
when
comes
queen
summer
tall
her
throat
a
lily
long
and
spiritual
rich
as
the
poppied
swaths
droned
haunts
of
bees
her
cheeks
a
brown
maid
gleaning
on
the
leas
will
love
grow
less
will
love
grow
less
when
autumn
sighing
there
broods
with
long
frost
streaks
in
her
dark
dark
hair
tears
in
grave
eyes
as
in
grave
heavens
above
deep
lost
in
memories
melancholy
love
will
love
grow
less
will
love
grow
less
when
winter
at
the
door
begs
on
her
scant
locks
icicles
as
hoar
while
death
eyes
hollow
her
shoulder
dart
a
look
to
wring
to
tears
then
freeze
the
heart
will
love
grow
less
and
in
her
hair
wept
softly
and
her
breast
rose
and
was
wet
with
tears
like
as
distressed
night
steals
on
day
rain
sobbing
thro
her
curls
tho
tears
become
thee
even
as
priceless
pearls
weep
not
for
love
sake
mine
no
gloom
of
doubt
but
woe
for
sweet
love
death
such
dreams
brought
out
nay
nay
crowned
throned
and
he
kings
our
hearts
eternally
love
high
in
heaven
beginning
and
to
cease
no
majesty
when
hearts
are
laid
at
peace
but
reign
supreme
if
souls
have
wrought
as
well
a
god
in
heaven
or
a
god
in
hell
yea
morgane
for
the
favor
of
his
face
all
our
rich
world
of
love
i
will
retrace
hurt
in
that
battle
where
thy
brother
strove
with
those
five
kings
thou
of
dearest
love
wherein
the
five
were
worsted
i
was
brought
to
some
king
castle
on
my
shield
methought
out
of
the
grind
of
spears
and
roar
of
swords
from
the
loud
shields
of
lords
culled
from
the
mountained
slain
where
havoc
sprawled
gorged
to
her
eyes
with
carnage
growling
crawled
by
some
tall
damsels
tiremaids
of
some
queen
stately
and
dark
who
moved
as
if
a
sheen
of
starlight
spread
her
presence
and
she
came
with
healing
herbs
and
searched
my
wounds
a
dame
so
marvelous
in
raiment
silvery
i
feared
lest
some
attendant
chaste
were
she
to
that
high
holy
grael
which
arthur
hath
sought
ever
widely
by
hoar
wood
and
path
thus
not
for
me
a
worldly
one
to
love
who
loved
her
even
to
wonder
skied
above
his
worship
as
our
moon
above
the
main
that
passions
upward
yearning
in
great
pain
and
suffers
wearily
from
year
to
year
she
peaceful
pitiless
with
virgin
ah
ideal
love
as
merciless
as
fate
and
oh
that
savage
aching
which
must
wait
for
its
fulfillment
tortured
love
in
tears
until
that
beauty
dreamed
of
many
years
bends
over
one
from
luminous
skies
so
grand
one
weakness
fears
to
touch
its
mastering
hand
and
hesitates
and
stammers
nothings
weak
and
loves
and
loves
with
love
that
can
not
speak
ah
there
the
tyranny
that
breeds
despair
breaks
hearts
whose
strong
youth
by
one
golden
hair
coiled
the
throat
is
sooner
strangled
dumb
than
by
a
glancing
dagger
thrust
from
gloom
of
an
old
arras
at
the
very
hour
one
thought
one
safest
in
one
guarded
thus
morgane
worshiping
that
lady
i
was
speechless
longing
now
to
live
now
die
as
her
fine
face
suggested
secrets
of
some
passion
kin
to
mine
or
scorn
of
love
that
dragged
heroic
humbleness
to
her
feet
for
one
long
look
that
spake
and
made
such
sweet
ah
never
dreamed
i
of
what
was
to
be
nay
nay
how
could
i
while
that
agony
of
doubtful
love
denied
my
heart
too
much
too
much
to
dream
of
that
perfection
such
as
was
to
grant
me
boisterous
hours
of
life
and
sever
all
the
past
as
with
a
knife
one
night
a
tempest
scourged
and
beat
and
lashed
the
writhing
forest
and
vast
thunders
crashed
clamorous
with
clubs
of
leven
and
anon
between
the
thunder
pauses
seas
would
groan
like
some
enormous
curse
a
knight
hath
lured
from
where
it
soared
to
maim
it
with
his
sword
i
with
eyes
partly
lidded
seemed
to
see
that
cloudy
night
eternity
yawn
hells
of
golden
ghastliness
and
sweep
distending
foams
tempestuous
up
each
steep
of
furious
iron
where
pale
mermaids
sit
with
tangled
hair
who
bit
by
bit
chant
glimmering
beckoning
on
to
strangling
arms
some
hurt
bark
hurrying
in
the
ravenous
resistless
exultation
till
there
came
one
breaker
mounting
inward
all
aflame
with
green
to
boom
against
the
cliff
its
thunderous
bulk
and
there
sucked
pale
and
stiff
tumbled
in
eddies
up
the
howling
rocks
my
dead
drawn
face
eyes
lidless
matted
locks
oozed
close
with
brine
tossed
upward
merrily
by
streaming
madly
seemed
to
see
the
vampire
echoes
of
the
hoarse
wood
who
collected
sought
me
down
the
casement
drew
wet
shuddering
fingers
sharply
thronging
fast
up
hooting
turrets
fell
thick
screaming
cast
down
bastioned
battlements
trooped
whistling
off
from
the
wild
woodland
growled
a
backward
then
far
away
hoofs
of
a
thousand
gales
as
wave
rams
wave
up
windy
bluffs
of
wales
loosed
from
the
groaning
hills
the
cohorts
loud
spirits
of
thunder
charioteered
of
cloud
roared
down
the
rocking
night
cored
with
the
glare
of
fiery
eyeballs
swimming
their
drenched
hair
blown
black
as
rain
unkempt
back
from
black
brows
wide
mouths
of
storm
that
voiced
a
hell
carouse
and
bulged
tight
cheeks
with
wind
rolled
riotous
by
ruining
to
ruinous
cliffs
to
headlong
die
once
when
the
lightning
made
the
casement
glare
squares
touched
to
gold
between
it
rose
her
hair
as
if
a
raven
wing
had
cut
the
storm
seaward
and
a
vague
alarm
stung
me
with
terrors
of
surmise
where
hope
as
yet
pruned
weak
wings
crippled
by
their
scope
and
lo
she
kneeled
low
radiant
wonderful
and
white
kneeled
low
lull
these
thoughts
of
night
such
storms
might
shape
in
thee
all
such
to
peace
and
sleep
ah
god
to
see
her
like
a
benediction
fleshed
with
her
hearing
her
voice
her
cool
hand
wandering
bare
wistful
on
feverish
brow
thro
long
deep
curls
to
see
her
rich
throat
carcaneted
pearls
rise
as
her
pulses
eyes
large
influence
poured
toward
me
straight
as
stars
whose
sole
defense
against
all
storm
is
their
bold
beauty
then
to
feel
her
breathe
and
hear
her
speak
again

dreamed
i
moaned
in
dreams
wails
the
tumult
and
the
thunder
gleams
as
if
of
arthur
knights
had
charged
two
fields
bright
as
of
dawn
swords
spears
and
shields
flashed
lordly
shocked
had
to
a
man
gone
down
in
burst
of
battle
hurled
lain
silent
sown
love
one
eternal
tempest
thus
with
thee
were
calm
dead
calm
but
no
for
thee
in
me
such
calm
proves
tempest
speak
i
feel
thy
voice
throb
soft
caressing
silence
healing
noise
is
radiance
loved
of
radiance
day
of
day
lithe
beam
of
beam
and
laughing
ray
of
ray
hope
loved
of
hope
and
happiness
of
joy
or
love
of
love
who
hath
the
world
for
toy
and
thou
thou
my
voice
fond
accolon
why
not
yea
why
not
nay
i
prithee
groan
not
for
that
thou
hast
had
long
since
thine
all
she
smiled
and
dashed
down
storm
wall
baptizing
moonlight
bathed
her
foot
and
face
deluging
as
my
soul
brake
toward
her
grace
with
worship
from
despair
and
secret
grief
that
felt
hot
tears
of
heartsease
sweet
and
brief
and
one
immortal
night
to
me
she
said
words
lay
i
white
in
death
had
raised
me
red
now
they
were
love
thee
with
love
speak
of
secret
love
but
god
above
hath
knowledge
and
passionate
low
lie
by
thee
my
mind
is
so
she
laughed
well
for
me
why
thy
fast
word
of
knighthood
look
thou
and
this
naked
sword
laid
in
betwixt
us
let
it
be
a
wall
strong
between
love
and
lust
and
me
all
in
all
undid
the
goodly
gold
from
her
clasped
waist
unbound
deep
locks
and
like
a
blossom
faced
stood
sweet
an
unswayed
stem
that
ran
to
bud
in
breasts
and
face
a
graceful
womanhood
and
fragrance
was
to
her
as
natural
as
odor
to
the
rose
and
she
a
tall
white
ardor
and
white
fervor
in
the
room
moved
some
pale
presence
that
with
light
doth
bloom
then
all
mine
eyes
and
lips
and
limbs
were
fire
my
tongue
delirious
throbbed
a
lawless
lyre
that
harped
loud
words
of
laud
for
loveliness
inspired
of
such
but
these
i
can
not
guess
then
she
as
pure
as
snows
of
peaks
that
keep
crowns
of
virgin
vanquishing
steep
frowned
on
me
and
the
thoughts
that
in
my
brain
had
risen
a
glare
of
gems
set
dull
like
rain
and
fair
i
spake
her
and
with
civil
pain
sweet
a
devil
kindness
which
is
given
for
earthly
pleasure
but
bars
out
from
heaven
temptation
harbored
like
a
bloody
rust
on
a
bright
blade
leaves
ugly
stains
and
lust
is
love
undoing
when
love
limbs
are
cast
a
commonness
to
desire
that
makes
unchaste
and
this
warm
nearness
of
what
should
be
hid
makes
love
a
lawless
love
but
thou
hast
bid
rest
thou
i
love
thee
how
i
only
know
but
all
that
love
shall
shout
out
at
love
foe
and
turning
sighed
into
my
hair
and
she
stretched
the
broad
blade
division
suddenly
and
so
we
lay
its
fire
between
us
twain
unsleeping
i
for
oh
that
devil
pain
of
passion
in
me
that
strove
up
and
stood
a
rebel
wrangling
with
the
brain
and
blood
an
hour
stole
by
she
slept
or
seemed
to
sleep
the
winds
of
night
came
vigorous
from
the
deep
with
storm
gusts
of
field
and
wold
that
breathed
of
ocean
meadows
bluely
rolled
i
drowsed
and
time
passed
stealing
as
for
one
whose
drowsy
life
dreams
in
avilion
vast
bulks
of
black
rack
went
down
high
casement
squares
of
heaven
a
crystal
crown
of
bubbled
moonlight
on
each
monstrous
head
like
as
great
ghosts
of
giant
kings
long
dead
and
then
meseemed
she
lightly
laughed
and
sighed
so
soft
a
taper
had
not
bent
aside
and
leaned
a
soft
face
seen
thro
loosened
hair
above
me
as
if
sweet
in
prayer
the
sword
i
take
the
sword
away
it
curved
and
clashed
where
the
strewn
rushes
lay
shone
glassy
glittering
like
a
watery
beam
of
moonlight
in
the
moonlight
i
did
deem
she
moved
in
sleep
and
dreamed
perverse
nor
wist
that
which
she
did
until
two
fierce
lips
kissed
my
wondering
eyes
to
wakement
of
her
thought
then
spake
i
my
word
is
it
then
naught
nay
nay
my
word
albeit
the
sword
be
gone
and
wouldst
thou
try
me
rest
thou
safe
till
dawn
i
will
not
thus
forswear
my
word
stands
fast
but
now
i
felt
hot
desperate
kisses
cast
on
hair
eyes
throat
and
lips
and
over
and
over
low
laughter
of
wretch
and
thou
a
lover
what
is
that
word
if
she
thou
gavest
it
unbind
thee
of
it
lo
and
she
sees
fit
ah
morgane
morgane
then
i
knew
was
thou
thou
thou
who
only
could
such
joy
allow
and
oh
unburied
passion
of
that
night
the
sleepy
birds
too
early
piped
of
light
too
soon
came
light
girt
with
a
rosy
breeze
strong
from
his
bath
to
wrestle
with
the
trees
a
thewy
hero
and
alas
too
soon
our
scutcheoned
oriel
stained
was
overstrewn
of
dawn
then
i
sang
a
strain
of
sleep
that
in
my
memory
strives
again
ethereal
limbed
the
lovely
sleep
should
sit
her
starbeam
locks
with
some
vague
splendor
lit
like
that
the
emerald
radiance
sheds
thro
twilight
globed
on
her
face
as
fair
as
if
of
graven
stone
yet
dim
and
airy
us
a
cloud
alone
in
the
bare
blue
of
heaven
smiling
sweet
for
languorous
thoughts
of
love
that
flit
and
fleet
about
her
crumpled
hair
yet
on
her
brow
a
pensiveness
more
fair
ungraspable
and
sad
and
lost
i
wist
than
thoughts
of
maiden
whom
her
love
hath
kissed
who
knows
thro
deepening
eyes
and
drowsy
breath
him
weeping
bent
whiles
she
drifts
on
to
death
full
sweet
and
sorrowful
and
blithe
withal
should
be
her
brow
not
wholly
spiritual
but
tinged
with
mortal
for
the
mortal
mind
and
smote
with
flushings
from
some
eden
wind
hinting
at
heart
ease
and
a
god
desire
of
pleasure
hastening
in
a
garb
of
fire
from
some
dim
country
over
storied
seas
glassed
of
content
and
foamed
of
mysteries
her
ears
two
pink
and
strung
to
harkening
as
if
on
a
brink
night
with
profundity
of
death
and
doubt
yet
touched
with
awfulness
of
light
poured
out
ears
strung
to
palpitations
of
heart
throbs
as
waver
with
dim
ocean
sobs
one
hand
curved
like
a
mist
on
dusking
skies
hollowing
smooth
brows
to
shade
dark
velvet
eyes
and
dewed
of
beautiful
to
sound
the
cowering
conscience
of
the
dull
features
in
their
human
rest
ere
she
dare
trust
her
pureness
to
that
breast
large
limbs
diaphanous
and
fleeced
with
veil
of
wimpled
heat
wove
of
the
pulsing
pale
of
rosy
midnight
and
stained
thro
with
stars
in
golden
cores
clusters
of
quivering
bars
of
nebulous
gold
twined
round
her
fleecily
a
lucid
shape
vague
in
vague
mystery
untrammeled
bosoms
swelling
free
and
white
and
prodigal
of
balm
cupped
lilies
bright
that
to
the
famished
mind
yield
their
pure
best
voluptuous
sleep
like
honey
sucked
in
rest
thus
they
communed
and
there
her
castle
stood
with
slender
towers
ivied
the
wood
an
ancient
chapel
near
a
forest
vista
where
faint
herds
of
deer
stalked
like
soft
shadows
where
the
hares
did
run
mavis
and
throstle
caroled
in
the
sun
for
it
was
morgane
realm
embowered
gore
that
rooky
pile
her
palace
whence
she
bore
with
urience
sway
but
he
at
camelot
knew
naught
of
intrigues
here
at
chariot
ii
noon
and
the
wistful
autumn
sat
among
the
lurid
woodlands
chiefs
who
now
were
wrung
by
crafty
ministers
sun
wind
and
frost
to
don
imperial
pomp
at
any
cost
on
each
wild
hill
they
stood
as
if
for
war
flaunting
barbaric
raiment
wide
and
far
and
lusts
in
aged
faces
raged
their
tottering
state
by
flattering
zephyrs
paged
who
in
a
little
fretful
while
how
soon
would
work
rebellion
under
some
wan
moon
pluck
their
old
beards
deriding
shriek
and
tear
rich
royalty
sow
tattered
through
the
air
their
purple
majesty
and
from
each
head
dash
down
its
golden
crown
and
in
its
stead
set
there
a
mockery
of
snow
leave
them
bemoaning
beggars
bowed
with
woe
blow
blow
now
that
all
fresh
and
fine
as
earth
and
wood
can
make
it
fresh
as
brine
and
rare
with
sodden
scents
of
underbrush
ring
and
one
hears
a
cavalcade
bold
blare
of
horns
shrill
music
of
steel
bows
a
horn
a
horn
the
hunt
is
up
and
goes
beneath
the
oaks
in
green
dark
woodland
green
a
held
between
his
selle
and
hunter
head
and
at
his
thigh
a
good
broad
hanger
and
one
fist
on
high
to
wind
the
rapid
echoes
from
his
horn
that
start
the
field
birds
from
the
sheavéd
corn
uphurled
in
vollies
of
audacious
wings
that
cease
again
when
it
no
longer
sings
away
away
they
flash
a
belted
band
from
camelot
thro
that
land
hounds
leashed
and
leamers
and
a
flash
of
steel
a
tramp
of
horse
and
the
peal
of
stag
hounds
and
behold
the
hart
a
lordly
height
doth
from
the
covert
dart
and
the
big
strain
unto
the
chase
the
seems
but
a
pace
on
ere
is
wound
but
now
where
interlace
the
underwoods
the
hounds
have
lost
the
slot
there
where
a
forest
brook
hath
crossed
with
intercepting
waters
full
of
leaves
beyond
the
hart
a
tangled
labyrinth
weaves
thro
dimmer
boscage
and
the
wizard
sun
shapes
many
shadowy
stags
that
seem
to
run
wild
herds
before
the
baffled
foresters
and
treed
aloft
a
reckless
laugh
one
hears
as
if
some
helping
goblin
from
the
trees
mocked
them
the
unbayed
hart
and
made
a
breeze
his
pursuivant
of
mocking
hastening
thence
pursued
king
arthur
and
king
urience
with
one
small
brachet
till
scarce
hear
could
they
their
fellowship
course
away
on
fresher
trace
of
hind
or
rugged
boar
with
haggard
hairy
flanks
curled
tusks
and
hoar
with
fierce
and
of
these
bereft
the
kings
continued
in
the
slot
they
left
and
there
the
hart
plunged
gallant
thro
the
brake
leaving
a
torn
path
shaking
in
his
wake
down
which
they
followed
on
thro
many
a
copse
above
whose
brush
close
on
before
the
tops
of
the
large
antlers
swelled
anon
and
so
were
gone
where
beat
the
brambles
to
and
fro
and
still
they
drave
him
hard
and
ever
near
seemed
that
great
hart
unwearied
and
such
cheer
still
stung
them
to
the
chase
when
arthur
horse
gasped
mightily
and
lunging
in
his
course
lay
dead
a
lordly
bay
and
urience
left
his
gray
hunter
dying
near
and
thence
they
held
the
hunt
afoot
when
suddenly
were
they
aware
of
a
wide
roughened
sea
and
near
the
wood
the
hart
upon
the
sward
bayed
panting
unto
death
and
winded
hard
right
so
the
king
dispatched
him
and
the
wound
on
his
hunting
bugle
clearly
thrice
as
if
each
echo
which
that
wild
horn
blast
waked
from
its
sleep
the
quietude
had
cast
tender
as
mercy
on
it
in
a
band
rose
moving
sounds
of
gladness
hand
in
hand
came
twelve
fair
damsels
sunny
in
sovereign
white
from
that
red
woodland
gliding
these
each
knight
graced
with
obeisance
and
our
lord
said
one
tenders
ye
courtesy
until
the
dawn
the
earl
sir
damas
well
in
his
wide
keep
seen
thither
with
due
worship
ye
shall
sleep
and
then
they
came
to
a
hall
an
pile
whose
weedy
wall
towered
based
on
crags
rough
windy
turrets
high
an
old
gaunt
a
sky
wherein
the
moon
hung
large
and
full
down
on
dank
broke
the
dull
weird
monotone
of
ocean
and
wide
rolled
the
watery
wilderness
that
was
as
old
as
loud
defying
headlands
stretching
out
beneath
still
stars
with
a
voluminous
shout
of
wreck
and
wrath
forever
here
the
two
were
feasted
fairly
and
with
worship
due
all
errant
knights
and
then
a
damsel
led
each
knight
with
flaring
lamp
unto
his
bed
down
separate
corridores
of
that
great
keep
and
soon
they
rested
in
a
heavy
sleep
and
then
king
arthur
woke
and
woke
mid
groans
of
dolorous
knights
and
him
lay
the
bones
of
many
woful
champions
mouldering
and
he
could
hear
the
open
ocean
ring
wild
wasted
waves
above
and
so
he
thought
it
is
some
nightmare
weighing
me
distraught
by
that
long
hunt
and
then
he
sought
to
shake
the
horror
off
and
to
himself
awake
but
still
he
heard
sad
groans
and
whispering
sighs
and
deep
in
cells
the
eyes
of
pale
cadaverous
knights
shone
fixed
on
him
unhappy
and
he
felt
his
senses
swim
with
foulness
of
that
cell
and
what
are
ye
ghosts
of
chained
champions
or
a
company
of
phantoms
bodiless
fiends
if
speak
ye
can
speak
in
god
name
for
i
am
here
a
man
then
groaned
the
shaggy
throat
of
one
who
lay
a
dusky
nightmare
dying
day
by
day
yet
once
of
comely
mien
and
strong
withal
and
greatly
gracious
but
now
with
scrawny
beard
and
faded
hands
and
cheeks
sir
knight
said
he
know
that
the
wretch
who
speaks
is
but
an
one
of
twenty
knights
here
shamed
of
him
who
lords
this
castle
damas
named
who
mews
us
here
for
slow
starvation
keen
around
you
fade
the
bones
of
some
eighteen
tried
knights
of
britain
and
god
grant
that
soon
my
ghost
will
see
the
moon
beyond
the
vileness
of
this
prisonment
with
that
he
sighed
and
round
the
dungeon
went
a
rustling
sigh
like
saddened
sin
and
so
another
dim
thin
voice
complained
their
woe
he
doth
enchain
us
with
this
common
end
that
he
find
one
who
will
his
prowess
bend
to
the
attainment
of
his
livelihood
a
younger
brother
ontzlake
hath
he
good
and
courteous
withal
most
noble
whom
this
damas
hates
yea
ever
seeks
his
doom
denying
him
to
their
estate
all
right
save
that
he
holds
by
main
of
arms
and
might
and
thro
puissance
hath
he
some
fat
fields
and
one
rich
manor
sumptuous
where
he
yields
belated
knights
host
hospitality
then
bold
is
ontzlake
damas
cowardly
for
ontzlake
would
decide
by
sword
and
lance
body
for
body
this
inheritance
but
damas
dotes
on
life
so
courageless
thus
on
all
knights
perforce
lays
coward
stress
to
fight
for
him
or
starve
for
ye
must
know
that
in
his
country
he
is
hated
so
that
no
helm
here
is
who
will
take
the
fight
thus
fortunes
it
our
plight
is
such
a
plight
quoth
he
and
ceased
and
wondering
at
the
tale
the
king
was
thoughtful
and
each
faded
pale
poor
countenance
still
conned
him
when
he
spake
and
what
reward
if
one
this
battle
take
deliverance
for
all
if
of
us
one
consent
to
be
his
party
champion
but
treachery
and
he
are
so
close
kin
we
loathe
the
part
as
some
misshapen
sin
and
here
would
rather
dally
on
to
death
than
serving
falseness
save
and
slave
our
breath
may
god
deliver
you
for
mercy
sirs
and
right
anon
an
iron
noise
he
hears
of
chains
clanked
loose
and
bars
jarred
rusty
back
the
heavy
gate
croak
open
and
the
black
of
that
rank
cell
astonished
was
with
light
that
danced
fantastic
with
the
frantic
night
one
high
torch
sidewise
worried
by
the
gust
sunned
that
lorn
den
of
hunger
death
and
rust
and
one
tall
damsel
vaguely
vestured
fair
with
shadowy
hair
poised
on
the
rocky
stair
and
laughing
on
the
king
what
cheer
said
she
god
life
the
keep
stinks
vilely
and
to
see
so
noble
knights
endungeoned
hollowing
here
doth
pain
me
sore
with
pity
but
what
cheer
thou
mockest
us
for
me
the
sorriest
since
i
was
suckled
and
of
any
quest
to
me
the
most
imperiling
and
but
what
wouldst
thou
said
arthur
she
a
change
i
offer
thee
through
thee
to
these
with
thee
and
thou
but
grant
me
in
love
courtesy
to
fight
for
damas
and
his
livelihood
and
if
thou
wilt
not
look
thou
seest
this
brood
of
lean
and
dwindled
bellies
keen
knights
erst
who
refused
me
so
decide
then
thought
the
king
of
the
sweet
sky
the
breeze
that
blew
delirious
over
waves
and
trees
thick
fields
of
grasses
and
the
sunny
earth
whose
beating
heat
filled
the
red
heart
with
mirth
and
made
the
world
one
sovereign
pleasure
house
where
king
and
serf
might
revel
and
carouse
then
of
the
hunt
on
hills
lone
forest
chapels
by
their
radiant
rills
his
palace
rich
at
caerlleon
upon
usk
and
camelot
loud
halls
that
thro
the
dusk
blazed
far
and
bloomed
a
rose
of
revelry
or
in
the
misty
morning
shadowy
loomed
grave
for
audience
and
then
he
thought
of
his
round
table
and
that
grael
wide
sought
in
haunted
holds
on
shore
then
marveled
of
what
wars
would
rise
and
roar
with
dragon
heads
unconquered
and
devour
this
realm
of
britain
and
pluck
up
that
flower
of
chivalry
whence
ripened
his
renown
and
then
the
reign
of
some
besotted
crown
a
bandit
king
of
lust
idolatry
and
with
that
thought
for
tears
he
could
not
see
then
of
his
greatest
champions
king
ban
son
and
galahad
and
tristram
accolon
and
then
ah
god
of
his
dear
guenevere
and
with
that
thought
to
starve
and
moulder
here
for
being
unfriend
to
arthur
and
his
court
well
wist
he
this
grim
earl
would
bless
that
sport
of
fortune
which
had
fortuned
him
so
well
to
have
to
starve
his
sovereign
in
a
in
the
entombing
rock
where
ground
the
deep
and
all
the
life
shut
in
his
limbs
did
leap
thro
eager
veins
and
sinews
fierce
and
red
stung
on
to
action
and
he
rose
and
said
that
which
thou
askest
is
right
hard
but
lo
to
rot
here
harder
i
will
fight
his
foe
but
mark
i
have
no
weapons
and
no
mail
no
steed
against
that
other
to
avail
fear
not
for
that
and
thou
shalt
lack
none
sire
and
so
she
led
the
path
her
torch
fire
scaring
wild
spidery
shadows
at
each
stride
from
coignes
of
scowling
passes
wide
that
labyrinthed
the
rock
foundation
strong
of
that
ungainly
fortress
bleak
of
wrong
at
length
they
came
to
a
door
which
she
unlocked
with
one
harsh
key
she
bore
mid
many
keys
bunched
at
her
girdle
thence
they
issued
on
a
terraced
eminence
beneath
the
sea
broke
sounding
and
the
king
breathed
open
air
that
had
the
smell
and
sting
of
brine
and
foam
for
in
the
east
the
second
dawning
gloam
since
that
unlucky
chase
was
freaked
with
streaks
red
as
the
ripe
stripes
of
an
apple
cheeks
and
so
within
that
larger
light
of
dawn
it
seemed
to
arthur
now
that
he
had
known
this
maiden
at
his
court
and
so
he
asked
but
she
her
real
person
masked
and
answered
falsely
nay
deceive
thee
not
thou
me
at
arthur
court
i
wot
for
here
it
likes
me
best
to
sing
and
spin
and
work
the
hangings
my
sire
halls
within
no
courts
or
tournaments
or
gallants
brave
to
flatter
me
and
love
for
me
the
wave
the
forest
field
and
sky
the
calm
the
storm
my
garth
wherein
i
walk
to
think
the
charm
of
uplands
redolent
at
bounteous
noon
and
full
of
sunlight
night
free
stars
and
moon
white
ships
that
pass
some
several
every
year
these
lonesome
towers
and
those
wild
mews
to
hear
an
owlet
maid
the
king
laughed
but
untrue
was
she
and
of
false
morgane
treasonous
crew
who
worked
vile
wiles
to
the
slaying
of
the
king
whom
she
did
not
love
and
presently
she
brought
him
where
in
state
this
swarthy
damas
with
mailed
cowards
sate
king
urience
that
dawning
woke
and
found
himself
safe
couched
at
camelot
and
wound
in
morgane
arms
nor
weened
he
how
it
was
that
this
thing
secretly
had
come
to
pass
but
accolon
at
chariot
sojourned
still
content
with
his
own
dreams
for
was
the
will
of
morgane
thus
to
keep
him
hidden
here
for
her
desire
excess
where
everywhere
in
gore
by
wood
and
river
pleasure
houses
pavilions
rose
of
rock
for
love
carouses
and
there
in
one
where
was
her
dearest
wont
to
list
a
tinkling
falling
water
fount
which
thro
sweet
talks
of
idle
paramours
at
sensuous
ease
on
tumbled
beds
of
flowers
had
caught
a
laughing
language
light
thereof
and
rambled
ever
gently
whispering
love
on
cool
white
walls
her
hands
had
deftly
draped
a
dark
rich
hanging
where
were
worked
and
shaped
her
fullest
hours
of
pleasure
flesh
and
mind
imperishable
passions
which
could
wind
the
past
and
present
quickly
and
could
mate
dead
loves
to
kisses
and
intoxicate
with
words
of
past
delight
and
song
the
heavy
heart
that
wronged
forgot
the
wrong
and
there
beside
it
pooled
the
urnéd
well
and
slipping
thence
thro
dripping
shadows
fell
from
rippling
rock
to
rock
here
accolon
with
morgane
hollow
lute
one
studious
dawn
came
solely
with
not
her
brindled
hound
to
leap
beside
him
the
gleaming
ground
no
handmaid
lovely
of
his
loveliest
fair
or
paging
dwarf
in
purple
with
him
there
but
this
her
lute
about
which
her
perfume
clung
odorous
of
memories
that
made
bloom
her
flowing
features
rosy
to
his
eyes
that
saw
the
words
his
sense
could
but
surmise
shaped
on
dim
breathing
lips
the
laugh
that
drunk
her
deep
from
eyes
wherein
it
sunk
and
slowly
waned
away
to
smouldering
dreams
fathomless
with
thought
far
in
their
gleams
and
so
for
those
most
serious
eyes
and
lips
faint
filmy
features
all
the
music
slips
of
buoyant
being
bubbling
to
his
voice
to
chant
her
praises
and
with
nervous
poise
his
fleet
trained
fingers
call
from
her
long
lute
such
riotous
notes
as
must
make
madly
mute
the
nightingale
that
listens
quivering
and
well
he
knows
that
winging
hence
it
sing
these
aching
notes
whose
beauties
burn
and
pain
its
anguished
heart
now
sobless
not
in
vain
wild
her
casement
in
that
garden
old
dingled
with
heavy
roses
in
the
gold
of
camelot
stars
and
moon
and
if
it
dies
the
heartache
of
the
tune
shall
clamor
stormy
passion
at
her
ear
of
death
more
dear
than
life
if
love
be
there
melt
her
quick
eyes
to
tears
her
throat
to
sobs
tumultuous
heaved
while
separation
throbs
hard
at
her
heart
and
longing
rears
to
death
two
prayerful
eyes
of
pleading
for
one
breath
an
ardor
of
fierce
life
crushed
in
his
arms
close
close
and
oh
for
such
all
these
smooth
charms
full
sentient
charms
voluptuous
evermore
and
sweet
to
know
these
sensitive
vows
shall
soar
to
the
dull
ear
of
her
drowsy
lord
beside
her
with
each
word
harped
in
the
bird
voice
rhythmically
clear
and
thus
he
sang
to
her
who
was
not
there
she
comes
her
presence
like
a
moving
song
breathed
soft
of
loveliest
lips
and
tongue
sways
all
the
gurgling
forests
from
their
rest
i
fancy
where
her
rustling
foot
is
pressed
so
faltering
love
seems
timid
but
how
strong
that
darling
love
that
flutters
in
her
breast
she
comes
and
the
green
vistas
are
stormed
thro
as
if
wild
wings
with
dripped
dew
had
dashed
a
sudden
sunbeam
tempest
past
with
her
eyes
inspiration
clearly
chaste
a
rhythmic
lavishment
of
bright
gray
blue
long
arrows
of
her
eyes
perfection
cast
ah
god
she
comes
and
love
i
feel
thy
breath
like
the
soft
south
who
idly
wandereth
thro
musical
leaves
of
laughing
laziness
page
on
before
her
how
sweet
none
can
guess
to
say
my
soul
harmony
dear
as
death
to
sigh
wild
vows
or
utterless
to
bless
she
comes
ah
god
and
all
my
brain
is
brave
to
war
for
words
to
laud
her
and
to
lave
her
queenly
beauty
in
such
vows
whereof
may
hush
melodious
cooings
of
a
dove
for
her
light
feet
the
favored
path
to
pave
with
oaths
like
roses
raving
mad
with
love
she
comes
in
me
a
passion
as
the
moon
works
madness
in
strong
men
my
blood
doth
swoon
towards
her
glory
and
i
feel
her
soul
cling
lip
to
lip
with
mine
and
now
the
whole
mix
with
me
aching
like
a
tender
tune
exhausted
lavished
in
a
god
control
she
comes
ah
christ
ye
eager
stars
that
grace
the
fragmentary
skies
that
dimple
space
clink
and
i
hear
her
footfalls
come
ah
perfume
art
of
her
presence
of
her
face
that
like
some
gracious
blossom
stains
the
gloom
oh
living
exultation
of
the
blood
that
now
as
sunbursts
the
almighty
mood
of
some
moved
god
scatter
the
storm
that
roars
and
hush
her
love
like
some
spent
splendor
pours
into
it
all
immaculate
maidenhood
and
all
the
heart
that
hesitates
adores
vanquished
so
vanquished
ah
triumphant
sweet
the
height
of
heaven
supine
at
thy
feet
where
love
feasts
crowned
and
basks
in
such
a
glare
as
hearts
of
suns
burn
in
thine
eyes
and
hair
unutterable
with
raveled
fires
that
cheat
the
ardent
clay
of
me
and
make
me
air
and
so
rare
witch
thy
blood
like
some
lewd
wine
shall
subtly
make
me
like
thee
half
divine
and
sweet
rebellion
clasp
thee
till
thou
urge
to
combat
close
of
savage
kisses
surge
a
war
that
rubies
all
thy
proud
cheeks
shine
slain
struggling
blushes
till
white
truce
emerge
my
life
for
thine
thus
bartered
lip
to
lip
a
striving
being
pulsant
that
shall
slip
like
song
and
flame
in
sense
from
thee
to
me
nor
held
but
quick
rebartered
thence
to
thee
so
our
two
loves
be
as
a
singleship
ten
thousand
loves
as
one
eternally
babbled
the
woodland
like
a
rocky
brook
and
as
the
ecstacy
of
foliage
shook
hot
pieces
of
bright
sunny
heavens
glanced
like
polished
silver
thro
pale
leaves
that
danced
as
one
hath
seen
some
huntress
fair
morn
in
her
cheeks
and
midnight
in
her
hair
eyes
clear
as
hollow
dews
clean
limbs
as
lithe
as
limbs
swift
morning
moves
a
voice
as
blithe
as
high
hawk
ringing
thro
the
falling
dews
pant
thro
the
avenues
where
brier
and
thorn
have
gashed
her
gown
pinched
green
about
bright
breasts
and
arms
the
milky
sheen
of
white
skin
healthy
pouting
out
her
face
ardent
and
flushed
fixed
on
the
lordly
chase
iii
the
eve
now
came
and
shadows
cowled
the
way
like
somber
palmers
who
have
kneeled
to
pray
beside
a
wayside
shrine
and
rosy
rolled
up
the
capacious
west
a
grainy
gold
luxuriant
fluid
burned
thro
strong
keen
skies
which
seemed
as
towering
gates
of
paradise
surged
dim
far
glories
on
the
hungry
gaze
and
from
that
sunset
down
the
roseate
ways
to
accolon
who
with
his
idle
lute
reclined
in
revery
against
a
root
of
a
great
oak
a
fragment
of
that
west
a
dwarf
in
crimson
satin
tightly
dressed
skipped
like
a
leaf
the
rather
frosts
have
burned
and
cozened
to
a
fever
red
that
turned
and
withered
all
its
sap
and
this
one
came
from
camelot
from
his
beloved
dame
morgane
the
fay
he
on
his
shoulder
bore
a
burning
blade
wrought
strange
with
wizard
lore
runed
mystically
and
a
scabbard
which
glared
venomous
with
angry
jewels
rich
he
louting
to
the
knight
sir
knight
said
he
your
lady
with
all
sweetest
courtesy
assures
you
ah
unworthy
messenger
i
of
such
brightness
of
that
love
of
her
then
doffing
that
great
baldric
with
the
sword
to
him
he
gave
and
this
from
him
my
lord
king
arthur
even
his
excalibur
the
sovereign
blade
which
merlin
gat
of
her
the
ladye
of
the
lake
who
launcelot
fostered
from
infanthood
as
well
you
wot
in
some
wierd
mere
in
briogn
tangled
lands
of
charms
and
mist
where
filmy
fairy
bands
by
lazy
moons
of
autumn
spin
their
fill
of
giddy
morrice
on
the
frosty
hill
by
goodness
of
her
favor
this
is
sent
who
craved
king
arthur
boon
with
this
intent
that
soon
for
her
a
desperate
combat
one
with
one
of
mightier
prowess
were
begun
and
with
the
sword
excalibur
right
sure
were
she
against
that
champion
to
endure
the
blade
but
more
prize
the
sheath
which
stauncheth
blood
and
guardeth
from
all
death
he
said
and
accolon
looked
on
the
sword
a
mystic
falchion
and
it
shall
wend
hard
with
him
thro
thee
unconquerable
blade
he
be
who
on
my
queen
hath
laid
stress
of
unworship
and
the
hours
as
slow
as
palsied
hours
in
purgatory
go
for
those
unmassed
till
i
have
slain
this
foe
my
purse
sweet
page
and
now
to
her
who
gave
dispatch
and
this
to
all
commands
her
slave
to
death
obedient
in
love
or
war
her
love
to
make
me
all
the
warrior
plead
her
grace
mercy
for
so
long
delay
from
love
that
dies
an
hourly
death
each
day
till
her
white
hands
kissed
he
shall
kiss
her
face
by
which
his
life
breathes
in
continual
grace
thus
he
commanded
and
incontinent
the
dwarf
departed
like
a
red
ray
sent
from
rich
clouds
of
suffused
light
winged
long
purple
glooms
and
with
the
night
whose
votaress
cypress
stoled
the
dying
strife
softly
of
day
and
for
whose
perished
life
gave
heaven
her
golden
stars
in
dreamy
thought
wends
accolon
to
hazy
chariot
and
it
befell
him
wandering
one
dawn
as
was
his
wont
across
a
lawn
glad
with
night
freshness
and
elastic
health
in
sky
and
earth
that
lavished
worlds
of
wealth
from
heady
breeze
and
racy
smells
a
knight
and
lofty
lady
met
he
gay
bedight
with
following
of
six
esquires
and
they
held
on
straight
wrists
the
jess
gerfalcon
gray
and
rode
the
leas
of
gore
from
ontzlake
manor
where
he
languished
sore
hurt
in
the
lists
a
spear
thrust
in
his
thigh
who
had
besought
for
much
he
feared
to
die
this
knight
and
his
fair
lady
as
they
rode
to
hawk
near
chariot
the
queen
abode
that
they
would
pray
her
in
all
charity
fare
post
to
him
for
in
chirurgery
of
all
that
land
she
was
the
greatest
leach
and
her
to
his
recovery
beseech
so
accolon
saluted
they
drew
rein
and
spake
their
message
for
right
over
fain
were
they
toward
their
sport
that
he
might
bare
petition
to
that
lady
but
not
there
was
arthur
sister
as
they
well
must
wot
but
now
a
lay
at
camelot
of
guenevere
the
guest
and
there
with
her
four
other
queens
of
farther
britain
were
isoud
of
ireland
she
of
cornwall
queen
king
mark
wife
who
right
rarely
then
was
seen
at
court
for
jealousy
of
mark
who
knew
her
to
that
lance
of
lyonesse
how
true
since
mutual
quaffing
of
a
philter
while
how
guilty
guenevere
on
such
could
smile
she
of
northgales
and
she
of
eastland
and
she
of
the
out
isles
queen
a
fairer
band
for
sovereignty
and
love
and
loveliness
was
not
in
any
realm
to
grace
and
bless
then
quoth
the
knight
ay
see
how
fortune
turns
and
varies
like
an
april
day
that
burns
now
welkins
blue
with
calm
now
scowls
them
down
revengeful
with
a
black
storm
wrinkled
frown
for
look
this
damas
who
so
long
hath
lain
a
hiding
vermin
fearful
of
all
pain
dark
in
his
bandit
towers
by
the
deep
wakes
from
a
five
years
torpor
and
a
sleep
so
sends
dispatch
a
courier
to
my
lord
with
behold
with
the
sword
earl
damas
by
his
knight
at
point
of
lance
decides
the
issue
of
inheritance
body
to
body
or
by
champion
right
hard
to
find
such
ere
dawn
though
sore
bestead
lies
ontzlake
and
he
could
right
fain
were
he
to
save
his
livelihood
then
mused
sir
accolon
the
adventure
goes
as
my
lady
fashioneth
who
knows
but
what
her
arts
develop
this
and
make
and
thus
to
those
his
battle
i
will
take
and
he
be
so
conditioned

thence
departed

with

rumbled
moatward

into

crashing
on

at

the

where
the
fierce
eyes
made
a
cavernous
smouldering
fury
shield
at

unflinchingly
remained
and
scorned
to
yield
so
arthur
drew
aside
to
rest
upon
his
falchion
for
a
pause
but
accolon
as
yet
thro
virtue
of
that
magic
sheath
fresh
and
almighty
being
no
nearer
death
thro
loss
of
blood
than
when
the
trial
begun
chafed
with

but
arthur
with
the
sun
its
thirsty
heat
the
loss
from

leaned
fainting
weary
and
so
resting
stood
cried
accolon
here
is
no
time
for
rest
defend
thee
and
straight
on
the
monarch
pressed
defend
or
yield
thee
as
one
recreant
full
on
his
helm
a
hewing
blow
did
plant
which
beat
a
flying
fire
from
the
steel
smote
like
one
drunk
with
wine
the
king
did
reel
breath
brain
bewildered
then
infuriate
with
vigor
by
that
blow
in
hate
gnarled
all
his
strength
into
one
stroke
of
might
and
in
both
fists
the
huge
blade
knotted
tight
swung
red
terrific
to
a
sundering
as
some
bright
wind
that
hurls
th
uprooted
oak
boomed
full
the
beaten
burgonet
he
wore
hacked
thro
and
thro
the
crest
and
cleanly
shore
the
golden
boasting
of
its
griffin
fierce
with
hollow
clamor
down
astounded
ears
no
further
thence
but
shattered
to
the
grass
that
brittle
blade
crushed
as
if
made
of
glass
into
hot
pieces
like
a
broken
ray
burst
sunward
and
in
feverish
fragments
lay
then
groaned
the
king
unarmed
and
so
he
knew
this
no
excalibur
that
tried
and
true
most
perfect
tempered
runed
and
mystical
sobbed
betray
me
then
withal
him
seemed
this
foe
who
fought
with
so
much
stress
so
long
untiring
and
with
no
distress
of
wounds
or
heat
through
treachery
bare
his
brand
and
then
he
knew
it
by
its
hilt
that
hand
clutched
to
an
avenging
stroke
for
accolon
in
madness
urged
the
belted
battle
on
his
king
defenseless
who
the
hilted
cross
of
that
false
weapon
grasped
beneath
the
boss
of
his
shield
crouched
and
around
crawled
the
unequal
conflict
the
ground
sharded
with
shattered
spears
and
bits
of
shivered
steel
and
gold
that
burnt
in
fits
so
hunted
yet
defiant
cowering
beneath
his
bossy
shield
defense
the
king
persisted
stoutly
and
devising
still
how
to
secure
his
sword
and
by
what
skill
him
so
it
fortuned
when
most
desperate
in
that
hot
chase
they
came
where
shattered
late
lay
tossed
the
truncheon
of
a
bursten
lance
which
deftly
seized
to
accolon
advance
he
wielded
valorous
against
the
fist
smote
where
the
gauntlet
husked
the
nervous
wrist
which
strained
the
weapon
to
a
wrathful
blow
palsied
the
tightened
sinews
of
his
foe
loosened
from
effort
and
the
falchion
seized
easy
was
yielded
then
the
wroth
king
squeezed
hurling
the
of
his
shield
afar
him
in
both
knotted
arms
of
wiry
war
rocked
sidewise
twice
or
thrice
as
one
hath
seen
some
stern
storm
take
an
ash
tree
roaring
green
nodding
its
sappy
bulk
of
trunk
and
boughs
to
dizziness
from
tough
coiled
roots
carouse
its
long
height
thundering
so
king
arthur
shook
sir
accolon
and
headlong
flung
then
took
tearing
away
that
scabbard
from
his
side
tossed
thro
the
breathless
lists
that
far
and
wide
gulped
in
the
battle
voiceless
then
right
wroth
secured
excalibur
and
grasped
of
both
wild
hands
swung
glittering
and
brought
bitter
down
on
rising
accolon
steel
bone
and
brawn
hewed
thro
that
blow
unsettled
every
sense
bathed
in
a
world
of
blood
his
limbs
grew
tense
and
writhen
then
ungathered
limp
with
death
bent
to
him
arthur
from
the
brow
beneath
unlaced
the
helm
and
doffed
it
and
so
asked
when
the
fair
forehead

curled
dark
uncasqued
say
ere
i
slay
thee
whence
and
what
thou
art
what
king
what

thine
and
from
what

or
thou
diest
yet
that

methinks
i
have
beheld
it
where
say
ere
death
drinks
the
from

cups

he
answered
slow
and
short
with
tortured
breathing
i
one
accolon
of
gaul
a
knight
of
arthur

at

god
wot
what

then
seemed
the
victor
spasmed
with
keen
pain
covered
with
mailéd
hands
his
visored
face
thou
accolon
art
accolon
a
space
exclaimed
and
conned
him
then
asked
softly
say
whence
gatest
thou
this
sword
or
in
what
way
thou
hadst
it
speak
but
wandering
that
knight
heard
dully
senses
clodded
thick
with
night
then
rallying
earthward
woe

from

laughed
on

with

for

i
gave

how

thereafter
for

anger
in

gloomy

burnt
as

oft
may
see
a

leak
out
of

and
cease
to
be
slow
from
his

he
his

raised
and
on
the
dying
one
mute

gazed
then
low
bespake

grimly
accolon
i

with
an

strained
to

and
haggard
drew
up
full
his
armored
tallness
hoarsely
cried
the
king
and
at
his
mailed
feet
clashed
and
died
then
rose
a
world
of
anxious
faces
pressed
about
king
arthur
who
though
bespake
that
multitude
whiles
breath
and
power
remain
judge
we
these
brethren
this
harsh
hour
hath
yielded
damas
all
this
rich
estate
so
it
is
his
allotted
his
of
fate
thro
might
of
arms
so
let
it
be
to
him
for
stood
our
oath
on
knighthood
not
so
slim
but
that
it
hath
this
strong
conclusion
this
much
by
us
as
errant
knight
is
done
now
our
decree
as
king
of
britain
hear
we
do
adjudge
this
damas
banned
outlawed
and
exiled
from
all
shores
and
isles
of
farthest
britain
in
its
many
miles
one
month
be
his
no
more
then
will
we
come
even
with
an
iron
host
to
seal
his
doom
if
he
be
not
departed
over
seas
hang
naked
from
his
battlements
to
please
of
carrion
ravens
and
wild
hawks
the
craws
thus
much
for
damas
but
our
pleasure
draws
toward
sir
ontzlake
whom
it
likes
the
king
to
take
into
his
knightly
following
of
that
round
table
stand
our
word
but
i
am
overweary
take
my
sword
unharness
me
for
battle
worn
i
tire
with

wounds
mad
with

and
monasteryward
would

right
fain

and
with
me

so
bare
they
then
the
wounded
king
away
the
dead
behind
so
closed
the
autumn
day
but
when
within

down

no

as

for

no

with

men

not
but
closely
keep
such
secrets
in
their
graves
to
rot
and
rot
to
dust
and
maggots
of
these
which
his
lot
thus
she
conspired
with
her
that
rainy
night
lone
in
her
chamber
when
no
haggard
white
wan
watery
moon
dreamed
on
the
streaming
pane
but
on
the
leads
beat
an
incessant
rain
and
sighed
and
moaned
a
weary
wind
along
the
turrets
and
torn
poplars
stirred
to
song
so
grew
her
face
severe
as
skies
that
take
dark
forces
of
full
storm
that
shake
with
murmurous
feet
black
hills
and
stab
with
fire
a
pine
some
moaning
forest
mourns
as
sire
so
touched
her
countenance
that
dark
intent
and
to
still
eyes
stern
thoughts
a
passion
sent
as
midnight
waters
luminous
glass
deep
suggestive
worlds
of
austere
stars
in
sleep
vague
ghostly
gray
locked
in
their
hollow
gloom
then
as
if
some
vast
wind
had
swept
the
room
silent
intense
had
raised
her
from
her
seat
of
dim
great
arms
had
made
her
a
retreat
secret
as
love
to
move
in
like
some
ghost
noiseless
as
death
and
subtle
as
sharp
frost
poised
like
a
light
and
borne
as
carefully
trod
she
the
gusty
hall
where
shadowy
the
stirring
hangings
rolled
a
pagan
war
and
there
the
mail
of
urience
shone
a
star
glimmering
above
a
dying
cresset
dropped
from
the
stone
vault
and
flared
and
here
she
stopped
and
took
the
sword
bright
burnished
by
his
page
and
ruddy
as
a
flame
with
restless
rage
grasping
this
death
unto
the
chamber
where
slept
innocent
her
spouse
she
moved
an
air
twined
in
soft
glossy
sendal
or
a
fit
of
faery
song
a
wicked
charm
in
it
a
spell
that
sings
seductive
on
to
death
then
paused
she
at
one
chamber
for
a
breath
listened
and
here
her
son
sir
ewain
slept
he
who
of
ravens
a
black
army
kept
in
war
than
fiercest
men
more
terrible
that
tore
forth
eyes
of
kings
who
blinded
fell
sure
that
he
slept
to
urience
stole
and
stood
dim
by
his
couch
about
her
heart
hot
blood
caught
strangling
then
throbbed
thudding
fever
up
to
her
broad
eyes
like
wine
whirled
in
a
cup
then
came
rare
recollection
with
a
mouth
sweet
as
the
honeyed
sunbeams
of
the
south
trickling
thro
perplexed
ripples
of
low
leaves
to
whose
faint
form
a
veil
of
starshine
cleaves
intricate
gauze
from
memoried
eyes
to
feet
feet
sandaled
with
crushed
sifted
snows
and
fleet
to
come
and
go
and
airy
anxiously
she
trembling
to
her
like
a
flower
a
bee
nests
in
and
makes
an
audible
mouth
of
musk
dripping
a
downy
language
in
the
dusk
laid
lips
to
ears
and
luted
memories
of
now
hateful
urience
her
maiden
love
that
willing
went
from
caerlleon
to
gore
one
dazzling
day
of
autumn
how
a
boar
wild
as
the
wonder
of
the
blazing
wood
raged
at
her
from
a
cavernous
solitude
which
yawned
the
bristling
curse
murderous
upon
her
how
her
steed
waxed
worse
and
snorting
terror
fled
unmanageable
pursued
with
fear
and
flung
her
from
the
selle
soft
slipping
on
a
bank
of
springy
moss
that
couched
her
swooning
in
an
utter
loss
of
mind
and
limbs
she
only
knew
twas
thus
as
one
who
pants
beneath
an
incubus
the
boar
thrust
toward
her
a
tusked
snout
and
fanged
of
hideous
bristles
and
the
whole
wood
clanged
and
buzzed
and
boomed
a
thousand
sounds
and
lights
lawless
about
her
brain
like
leaves
fierce
nights
of
hurricane
harvest
shouting
then
she
knew
a
fury
thunder
twixt
it
and
fleet
flew
moss
and
sandy
loam
that
held
shadows
of
the
wild
and
swelled
continual
echoes
with
the
thud
of
strife
and
breath
of
man
and
brute
that
warred
for
life
and
all
the
air
made
mad
with
foam
and
forms
spun
froth
and
wrestled
twixt
her
hair
and
arms
while
trampled
caked
the
stricken
leaves
or
shred
hummed
whirling
and
snapped
brittle
branches
dead
and
when
she
rose
and
leaned
her
throbbing
head
which
burst
its
uncoifed
rays
of
raven
hair
down
swelling
shoulders
pure
and
faultless
fair
on
one
milk
marvelous
arm
of
fluid
grace
beheld
the
brute
thing
throttled
and
the
face
of
angry
urience
over
browed
like
might
one
red
swoln
arm
that
pinned
the
hairy
fright
strong
as
a
god
iron
at
the
gullet
brawn
dug
in
his
midriff
the
close
knees
updrawn
wedged
deep
the
glutton
sides
that
quaked
and
strove
a
shaggy
bulk
whose
sharp
hoofs
horny
drove
thus
man
and
brute
burned
bent
when
urience
slipped
one
arm
the
horror
tearing
tusks
had
ripped
and
ribboned
redly
to
the
dagger
hilt
which
at
his
hip
hung
long
a
haft
its
rapid
splinter
drew
beamed
twice
and
thrice
high
in
the
sun
its
ghastliness
of
ice
plunged
and
the
great
boar
stretched
in
sullen
death
weakened
thro
wild
veins
groaned
laborious
breath
and
how
he
brought
her
water
from
a
well
that
rustled
freshness
near
them
as
it
fell
from
its
urn
in
his
deep
casque
and
prayed
her
quaff
then
bathed
her
brow
a
task
that
had
accompaning
tears
of
joy
and
vows
of
love
sweet
intercourse
of
eyes
and
brows
and
many
clinging
kisses
eloquent
and
how
when
dressed
his
arm
behind
him
bent
she
clasped
him
on
the
same
steed
and
they
went
on
thro
the
gold
wood
toward
the
golden
west
till
on
one
low
hill
crest
up
in
the
gold
his
castle
battlements
pressed
and
then
she
felt
she
loved
him
till
had
come
fame
of
the
love
of
isoud
whom
from
home
brought
knightly
tristram
the
irish
foam
and
guenevere
for
launcelot
of
the
lake
and
then
how
passion
from
these
seemed
to
wake
longing
for
some
great
gallant
who
would
slake
and
such
found
accolon
and
then
she
thought
how
far
she
fallen
and
how
darkly
fraught
with
consequence
was
this
then
what
distress
were
hers
and
his
her
lover
and
success
how
doubly
difficult
if
arthur
slain
king
urience
lived
to
assert
his
right
to
reign
so
paused
she
pondering
on
the
blade
her
lips
breathless
and
close
as
close
cold
finger
tips
hugged
the
huge
weapon
hilt
and
so
she
sighed
nay
long
too
long
hast
lived
who
shouldst
have
died
even
in
the
womb
abortive
who
these
years
hast
leashed
sweet
life
to
care
with
stinging
tears
a
knot
thus
harshly
severed
as
thou
art
into
the
elements
naked
his
heart
the
long
sword
hesitated
lean
as
crime
descended
redly
once
and
like
a
rhyme
of
nice
words
fairly
fitted
forming
on
a
sudden
ceasing
and
the
harmony
gone
so
ran
to
death
the
life
of
urience
a
strong
song
incomplete
of
broken
sense
there
glowered
the
crimeful
queen
the
glistening
sword
unfleshed
flung
by
her
wronged
and
murdered
lord
and
the
dark
blood
spread
broader
thro
the
sheet
to
drip
a
horror
at
impassive
feet
and
blur
the
polished
oak
but
lofty
she
stood
proud
relentless
in
her
ecstacy
a
lovely
devil
a
crowned
lust
that
cried
on
accolon
that
harlot
which
defied
heaven
with
a
voice
of
pulses
clamorous
as
steep
storm
that
down
a
cavernous
mountain
pass
blasphemes
an
hundred
echoes
with
like
power
the
inner
harlot
called
its
paramour
him
whom
king
arthur
had
commanded
when
borne
from
the
lists
be
granted
her
again
as
his
blithe
gift
and
welcome
from
that
joust
for
treacherous
love
and
her
adulterous
lust
and
while
she
stood
revolving
how
her
concealment
were
secured
a
grind
of
steeds
arms
jingling
stirrups
voices
loud
that
cursed
fierce
in
the
northern
court
to
her
athirst
for
him
her
lover
war
and
power
it
spoke
him
victor
and
so
king
and
then
awoke
a
yearning
to
behold
to
quit
the
dead
so
a
wild
specter
down
wide
stairs
she
fled
burst
on
a
glare
of
links
and
glittering
mail
that
shrunk
her
eyes
and
made
her
senses
quail
to
her
a
bulk
of
iron
bearded
fierce
down
from
a
steaming
steed
into
her
ears
this
from
the
king
a
boon
laughed
harsh
and
hoarse
two
henchmen
beckoned
who
pitched
sheer
with
force
loud
clanging
at
her
feet
hacked
hewn
and
red
crusted
with
blood
a
knight
in
armor
dead
even
accolon
tossed
with
the
mocking
scoff
this
from
the
king
phantoms
in
fog
rode
off
and
what
remains
from
camelot
to
gore
that
right
she
weeping
fled
then
to
the
shore
as
that
romancer
tells
avilion
where
she
hath
majesty
yet
wan
in
darkest
cypress
a
frail
pitious
face
queenly
and
lovely
sad
eyes
the
trace
of
immemorial
tears
as
for
some
crime
they
future
fixed
expectant
of
the
time
when
the
forgiving
arthur
cometh
and
shall
have
to
rule
all
that
lost
golden
land
that
drifts
vague
amber
in
forgotten
seas
of
surgeless
turquoise
dim
with
mysteries
and
so
was
seen
morgana
nevermore
save
once
when
from
the
cornwall
coast
she
bore
the
wounded
arthur
from
that
last
fought
fight
of
camlan
in
a
black
barge
into
night
but
oft
some
see
her
with
a
palfried
band
of
maidens
thro
the
drowsy
land
of
autumn
glimmer
when
are
sharply
strewn
the
red
leaves
while
broad
in
the
east
a
moon
swings
full
of
frost
a
lustrous
globe
of
gleams
faint
on
the
mooning
hills
as
shapes
in

of
rare
royal
rhenish
such
they
say
as
necromance
hides
guarded
in
vast
casks
of
antique
make
far
in
the
kyffhäuser
the
cellar
of
the
knights
near
sittendorf
so
mellowed
by
that
wine
to
friendship
frank
he
spake
me
his
intent
in
coming
here
but
not
one
word
of
what
his
parentage
but
this
his
name
was
rudolf
and
his
home
franconia
but
nor
why
he
left
nor
when
his
mind
to
live
a
forester
and
be
enfellowed
in
the
duke
of
brunswick
train
of
buff
and
green
and
so
to
his
estate
even
now
was
bound
a
youth
of
and
when
he
ceased
the
fire
in
his
eyes
worked
restless
as
a
troubled
animal
which
can
burn
a
steady
flame
brute
merciless
and
thus
i
mused
with
me
when
he
had
ceased
to
fulminate
at
state
another
count
von
hackelnburg
the
fiend
hath
tricked
unto
the
chase
for
hounds
from
hell
but
answered
nothing
save
light
words
of
cheer
as
best
become
fleet
friends
warm
wine
doth
make
then
as
it
chanced
old
kurt
had
come
that
morn
with
some
six
of
his
jerkined
foresters
from
the
thuringian
forest
damp
with
dew
as
morn
with
early
travel
bound
for
brunswick
dummburg
and
the
hakel
passed
chief
huntsman
he
then
to
the
goodly
duke
and
father
of
the
sunniest
maiden
here
in
ammendorf
the
blameless
ilsabe
who
motherless
the
father
prized
a
jewel
priceless
as
huge
barons
ghosts
guard
big
accumulated
hoards
of
wealth
in
caverned
cellars
robber
wells
beneath
the
dungeoned
dummburg
so
he
watched
her
all
his
world
in
her
who
was
his
wealth
a
second
lora
of
thuringia
she
faultless
for
love
instilled
all
souls
with
love
who
in
the
favor
of
her
maiden
smile
felt
friendship
grow
up
like
a
golden
thought
a
life
of
love
from
words
and
light
that
fell
and
wrought
calm
influence
from
her
pure
blue
eyes
hair
sedate
and
austerely
dressed
brows
white
as
a
harz
dove
wing
hair
with
the
hue
of
twilight
mists
the
sun
hath
soaked
with
gold
a
tyrolean
melody
that
brought
dim
dreams
of
alpine
heights
of
shepherds
brown
with
healthy
cheeks
and
wrinkled
lips
that
fill
wild
oaten
pipes
on
ways
embowered
deep
with
mountain
melodies
simple
with
love
and
plaintive
even
to
tears
her
presence
her
sweet
presence
like
a
song
and
when
she
left
it
was
as
when
one
hath
beheld
a
moonlit
undine
ere
the
mind
adjusts
one
thought
cleave
thro
the
glassy
rhine
a
glittering
beauty
wet
and
gone
again
a
flash
the
soul
drifts
wondering
on
in
dreams
some
thirty
years
agone
is
that
and
i
commissioner
of
the
duke
no
sinecure
i
can
assure
you
had
scarce
reached
the
age
of
thirty
then
some
three
years
of
that
house
thro
me
the
bold
franconian
whom
at
first
by
bitter
principles
and
scorn
of
state
developed
into
argument
thro
wine
the
foresthood
like
was
to
be
denied
was
then
enfellowed
yes
i
said
he
young
true
rashly
young
yet
see
a
wiry
frame
a
chamois
footing
and
a
face
for
right
an
eye
which
likes
me
not
but
quick
with
pride
and
aimed
at
thought
a
butt
it
may
not
miss
a
soul
with
virgin
virtues
which
crude
flesh
makes
seem
but
vices
these
but
god
may
see
develop
these
but
if
there
aught
of
worth

or

in
him
kurt
thou
wilt
know
and
to
the
surface
wear
as
divers
win
from
hideous
ooze
and

rich
jewels
lost
of
polished
pureness
worthless
left
to
night
thou
or
thy
daughter
and
inspire
for
good
a
year
thereafter
was
it
that
i
heard
of
rudolf
passion
for
kurt
ilsabe
then
their
betrothal
and
it
was
from
this
for
ah
that
ilsabe
that
ilsabe
good
mary
mother
how
she
haunts
me
yet
she
that
true
touchstone
which
philosophers
feign
contacts
and
golds
all
base
a
woman
who
could
touch
all
evil
into
good
in
surmised
i
of
the
excellency
which
refinement
of
her
gentle
company
warm
presence
of
chaste
beauty
had
resolved
his
fiery
nature
to
conditioning
slave
and
so
i
came
from
brunswick
as
you
know
is
custom
of
the
duke
or
by
his
seal
commissioned
proxy
his
commissioner
to
test
the
marksmanship
of
rudolf
who
succeeded
kurt
with
marriage
of
his
child
an
heir
of
he
great
grandfather
of
kurt
and
one
this
forestkeepership
was
first
possesor
of
established
thus
or
such
the
tale
they
told
me
the
hearths
kuno
once
in
the
knight
of
wippach
train
rode
on
a
grand
hunt
with
the
duke
who
came
with
vast
magnificence
of
knights
and
hounds
and
nobles
curled
and
plumed
to
hunt
thuringian
deer
then
morn
too
slow
on
her
blithe
feet
was
quick
with
laughing
eyes
to
morrow
mortal
eyes
and
lazy
limbs
rather
on
hills
recumbent
yawned
aroused
an
hour
too
soon
ashamed
disrobed
rubbed
the
stiff
sleep
from
eyes
that
still
would
close
while
brayed
the
hollow
horns
and
bayed
lean
hounds
and
cheered
gallants
until
the
dingles
dinned
where
searched
the
climbing
mists
or
compact
light
fled
breathless
white
clung
scared
a
moted
gray
low
unsunned
cloudlands
of
the
castled
hills
and
then
near
from
a
swarthy
brake
the
roused
a
red
gigantic
stag
lashed
to
whose
back
with
grinding
knotted
cords
borne
with
whom
like
a
nightmare
incubus
a
man
shrieked
and
his
hair
kinked
with
dry
tangled
burrs
and
he
himself
emaciated
and
half
naked
from
the
wear
of
wildest
passage
thro
the
wild
rent
red
by
briars
torn
and
bruised
by
rocks
for
such
the
law
then
when
the
peasant
chased
or
slew
the
dun
deer
of
his
tyrant
lords
as
punishment
the
torturing
withes
and
spine
of
some
big
stag
a
gift
of
game
and
wild
enough
till
death
death
in
the
antlered
herd
or
crawling
famine
in
bleak
haggard
haunts
then
was
the
dark
duke
glad
and
forthwith
cried
to
all
his
dewy
train
a
rich
reward
for
him
who
slew
the
stag
and
saved
the
man
but
death
to
him
who
slew
the
man
and
stag
the
careless
error
of
a
loose
attempt
so
crashed
the
hunt
along
wild
glimmering
ways
thro
creepers
and
vast
brush
beneath
gnarled
trees
up
a
scorched
torrent
bed
yet
still
refused
each
that
sure
shot
the
risk
too
desperate
the
poor
life
and
the
golden
gift
beside
so
this
young
kuno
with
two
eyes
wherein
hunt
with
excitement
kindled
reckless
fire
clamored
and
are
ye
cowards
good
your
grace
you
shall
not
chafe
the
fiend
direct
my
ball
and
fired
into
a
covert
deeply
packed
an
intertangled
wall
of
matted
night
wherein
the
eye
might
vainly
strive
and
strive
to
pierce
one
foot
or
earn
one
point
beyond
but
ha
the
huge
stag
staggered
from
the
brake
and
perished
that
wan
wretch
unhurt
soon
bondless
lay
condoled
but
the
great
duke
charmed
with
the
eagle
shot
admired
the
youth
there
to
him
and
his
heirs
forever
gave
the
forest
keepership
but
envious
tongues
were
soon
at
wag
and
whispered
went
the
tale
of
how
the
shot
was
free
and
that
the
balls
used
by
young
kuno
were
free
bullets
which
molded
were
cast
in
influence
of
the
fiend
by
magic
and
directed
by
the
fiend
of
some
effect
these
tales
were
and
some
force
had
with
the
duke
who
lent
an
ear
so
far
as
to
ordain
kuno
descendants
all
to
proof
of
skill
ere
their
succession
to
the
father
office
kurt
himself
hath
shot
the
silver
ring
from
out
the
popinjay
beak
a
good
shot
he
you
see
who
would
succeed
the
devil
guards
his
mysteries
close
as
god
for
who
can
say
what
elementaries
demoniac
lurk
in
desolate
dells
and
woods
shadowy
malicious
vassals
of
that
power
who
signs
himself
thro
these
a
slave
to
those
those
mortals
who
act
open
with
his
hell
those

who

secretly

hackelnburg
wild

of

rides
hoarse
in

dashing
the
dead
leaves
with
dark
dogs
of
hell
direful
thro
whirling
thickets
and
his

croaks
doleful
as
an
owl

while
he
hurls
straight
skies
of
echoes
sheer
plunging
the
magic
circle
horse
and
hounds
and
then
will
come
plutonian
clad
and
slim
upon
a
stallion
vast
intensely
black
semial
satan
lurid
minister
to
hail
you
and
inform
you
and
enough
these
heard
to
what
i
seen
to
ammendorf
i
came
and
rudolf
there
with
kurt
and
all
his
picturesque
foresters
met
me
and
then
the
rounding
year
was
ripe
throbbing
the
red
heart
of
full
autumn
when
each
morning
gleams
crisp
frost
on
shriveled
fields
each
noon
sits
veiled
in
mysteries
of
mist
each
night
unrolls
a
miracle
woof
of
stars
where
moon
goddess
of
the
hunt
wades
calm
crushed
clouds
or
treads
the
vaster
blue
then
i
proposed
the
season
hunt
till
eve
the
test
of
rudolf
skill
postponed
with
which
annoyed
he
seemed
and
so
it
was
i
heard
how
he
an
execrable
marksman
was
and
whispered
tales
of
near
incredible
shots
that
wryed
their
mark
while
in
his
pan
flashed
often
harmless
powder
while
wild
game
stared
fearless
on
him
and
indulgent
stood
an
open
butt
to
such
wide
marksmanship
howbeit
he
that
day
acquitted
him
of
these
maligners
cavils
in
the
hunt
missing
no
shot
however
rash
he
made
or
distant
thro
thick
intercepting
trees
and
the
piled
curious
game
brought
down
of
all
good
marksmen
of
that
train
had
not
sufficed
doubled
nay
trebled
to
have
matched
his
heap
and
wonderstruck
the
saw
nor
knew
how
to
excuse
them
my
indulgence
still
swore
that
only
yesterday
old
kurt
had
touched
his
daughter
tears
and
rudolf
wrath
by
vowing
end
to
their
betrothéd
love
unless
that
love
developed
better
aim
against
the
morrow
test
his
high
fame
should
not
be
damaged
so
he
stormed
but
bowed
his
gray
head
and
wept
silently
then
looking
up
forgave
when
big
he
saw
tears
in
his
daughter
eyes
and
rudolf
gone
forth
in
the
night
that
wailed
with
coming
storm
before
this
inn
the
owl
assembled
came
the
villagers
to
view
the
trial
fair
and
blonde
comely
healthy
stout
burgers
and
among
them
i
did
mark
kurt
and
his
daughter
he
a
florid
face
of
pride
and
joy
for
rudolf
strange
success
she
radiant
and
flounced
in
flowing
garb
of
bridal
white
and
crowned
with
flowers
for
kurt
insisted
this
their
marriage
eve
should
rudolf
come
successful
from
the
chase
so
pleased
was
i
with
what
i
seen
him
do
the
test
of
skill
superfluous
seemed
and
so
was
on
the
bare
brink
of
announcement
when
out
of
the
evening
heaven
hardening
red
like
a
white
warning
loosed
for
augury
a
word
of
god
some
fallen
angel
prized
as
his
last
all
of
heaven
penitent
sent
minister
to
save
a
soul
a
wild
dove
clove
the
luminous
winds
and
there
a
wafted
waif
pruned
settled
on
a
bough
then
i
thy
weapon
rudolph
pierce
its
head
cried
pointing
and
art
thou
pale
as
a
mist
and
wavering
he
turned
i
had
a
dream
then
faltered
as
he
aimed
a
woman
whim
but
starting
from
the
press
screamed
ilsabe
my
dove
to
plead
its
life
came
cracked
the
rifle
and
untouched
the
dove
rose
beating
lustrous
wings
but
ilsabe
god
wrath
the
sight
fell
smitten
and
the
blood
sprang
red
from
shattered
brow
and
silent
hair
that
bullet
strangely
thro
her
brow
and
brain
and
what
of
rudolf
ah
of
him
you
ask
that
proud
franconian
who
would
scoff
at
fate
and
scorn
all
state
who
cried
black
satan
friend
sooner
than
our
white
christ
why
he
went
mad
o
the
moment
and
into
the
haunted
harz
fled
an
unholy
thing
and
perished
there
the
prey
of
demons
of
the
dummburg
but
i
one
of
few
less
superstitious
who
say
as
the
finale
of
a
madman
deed
he
in
the
bodé
from
that
ragged
rock
the
devil
dancing
place
did
leap
and
die
to
revery
what
ogive
gates
from
gold
of
ophir
wrought
what
walls
of
bastioned
parian
lucid
rose
what
marts
of
crystal
for
the
eyes
of
thought
hast
builded
on
what
islands
of
repose
vague
onyx
columns
ranked
corinthian
or
piled
ionic
colonnading
heights
that
loom
above
long
burst
of
mythic
seas
vast
gynaeceums
of
carnelian
micaceous
temples
far
marmorean
flights
where
winds
the
arabesque

where
bulbous
domes
of
coruscating
ore
cloud
like
convulsive
sunsets
lands
that
dream
over

and
hoar
dashed
with
stiff
breezy
foam
of
ocean
stream
tempestuous
built
melodies
of
marble

effulgent
sculptures
chiseled
out
of

full
the
pleasure

like

o

for

gloom
glummer
being
shaggy
with

i
was
his
page
a
favorite
then
and
he
of
that
age
when
a
man
will
love
and
be
loved
again
or
die
in
the
wars
or
a
monastery
or
toil
till
he
stifle
his
heart
hard
pain
or
drink
drug
his
hopes
and
his
lost
love
bury
i
was
his
page
and
often
we
fared
thro
the
clare
desmene
in
autumn
hawking
if
the
baron
had
known
how
he
would
have
glared
from
their
bushy
brows
eyes
dark
with
mocking
that
of
the
strongbows
richard
i
mean
had
growled
to
his
yeomen
a
score
mount
keene
forth
and
spit
me
this
clifford
or
hang
with
his
page
to
the
closest
oak
for
he
and
the
cliffords
had
ever
a
fang
in
the
other
side
but
i
see
him
choke
and
strangle
with
wrath
when
his
hawker
told
if
he
told
how
we
met
on
that
flowery
wold
his
daughter
sweet
hortense
of
clare
the
day
her
hooded
tiercel
its
brails
did
burst
to
trail
with
its
galling
jesses
away
an
untrained
haggard
the
falconer
cursed
vain
whistled
to
lure
when
the
eyas
sped
slant
low
and
heavily
overhead
by
us
and
sir
hugh
who
had
just
then
cast
his
peregrine
fierce
at
a
in
his
stirrups
rising
thus
as
it
passed
by
the
jesses
caught
and
to
her
did
carry
lingering
slender
and
tall
by
a
rose
whence
she
pulled
the
berries
but
no
two
foes
her
eyes
and
sir
hugh
and
i
swear
each
felt
a
song
in
their
hearts
for
i
heard
him
quaver
somewhat
and
then
by
mary
he
knelt
and
the
lady
herself
in
her
words
did
waver
and
wonder
with
smiles
then
daintily
took
the
hawk
on
her
fist
where
it
pruned
and
shook
its
callowness
ragged
as
hugh
did
seize
softly
the
other
hand
long
and
white
reached
forth
to
him
craving
him
rise
from
his
knees
and
mouthed
with
moist
kisses
an
hundred
quite
tho
she
blushed
up
burning
no
frowned
beware
but
seemed
so
happy
when
crushing
thro
her
sturdy
retainer
with
swarthy
stare
the
underwoods
burst
and
her
maiden
crew
drew
near
them
naming
her
name
and
came
with
leaves
and
dim
autumn
blossoms
their
words
i
know
not
for
how
should
i
i
paged
my
master
but
was
no
spy
nothings
i
think
as
all
lovers
you
know
yet
how
should
i
hear
such
whispered
low
quick
by
the
wasted
woodland
yellow
when
up
thro
the
brush
thrashed
that
burly
fellow
with
his
face
and
so
made
a
pause
in
the
pulse
of
their
words
there
my
lord
sir
hugh
stood
with
the
soil
on
his
knee
no
cause
had
he
but
his
hanger
he
halfway
drew
then
paused
thrust
it
in
its
sheath
again
and
bowed
to
the
lady
and
strode
away
up
vault
on
his
steed
and
we
rode
amain
gay
to
his
towers
that
merry
day
he
loved
and
was
loved
why
i
knew
for
look
all
other
sports
for
the
chase
he
forsook
to
ride
in
the
raglan
marches
and
hawk
and
to
hunt
and
to
wander
and
found
a
lair
in
the
strongbow
forest
of
bush
and
of
rock
of
moss
and
thick
ferns
where
hortense
of
clare
how
often
i
wis
not
met
him
by
chance
perhaps
sweet
sorceress
out
of
romance
those
tomes
of
geoffrey
for
she
was
fair
her
large
warm
eyes
and
hair
ah
hair
how
may
one
picture
or
liken
it
with
the
golden
gloss
of
its
full
brown
fit
for
the
viviane
face
of
lovable
white
beneath
like
a
star
that
a
cloud
of
night
stops
over
to
threaten
but
never
will
drench
its
tremulous
beauty
with
mists
that
heigho
but
they
ceased
those
meetings
i
wot
watched
of
the
baron
his
menial
crew
for
she
loved
too
well
to
have
once
forgot
the
place
and
the
time
of
their
trysting
true
but
she
came
not
ah
and
again
came
not
and
when
would
question
sir
hugh
in
his
labored
scrawls
a
crevice
of
rock
the
lovers
post
in
its
coigne
would
lock
until
near
yule
love
gat
them
again
a
twilight
tryst
by
frowardness
they
met
and
that
day
was
gray
with
rain
or
snow
and
the
wind
did
ever
endure
a
long
bleak
moaning
thorough
the
wood
smarted
the
cheek
and
chapped
i
the
blood
and
a
burne
in
the
forest
cried
sob
and
sob
and
whimpered
forever
a
chopping
throb
thro
the
boughs
like
a
thing
pursued
and
there
it
was
that
he
learned
how
she
my
faith
how
it
makes
me
burn
and
quiver
to
think
what
a
miserable
despot
he
lord
richard
strongbow
aye
and
ever
to
his
daughter
was
forsooth
must
wed
with
an
eastern
earl
some
lovell
one
whom
that
god
in
his
mercy
had
smote
him
dead
hortense
of
clare
but
in
baby
bloom
never
had
mirrored
with
maiden
eyes
sealed
over
a
baby
to
strengthen
some
ties
of
power
or
wealth
had
been
bartered
then
and
sold
and
purchased
and
now
but
when
to
her
lover
the
clifford
she
told
this
there
he
had
faced
with
his
love
the
talons
of
death
only
for
her
who
did
stay
with
a
stare
of
reproach
all
his
heat
and
say
in
a
breath
is
love
that
thou
sware
to
me
aye
and
so
often
to
live
too
feeble
or
how
doth
it
soften
and
weaken
away
and
to
die
why
die
live
and
be
strong
and
this
is
why
her
words
are
glued
here
so
i
remember
all
as
well
as
that
sullen
december
that
blustered
and
bullied
about
them
and
spat
stiff
its
spiteful
and
snow
where
they
talked
there
dreamily
hand
in
hand
while
the
rubbing
boughs
clashed
rattling
low
her
last
words
these
by
curfew
sure
on
christmas
eve
at
the
postern
door
and
we
were
there
and
a
void
horse
too
armed
for
a
journey
i
hardly
knew
whither
but
why
you
well
can
guess
i
could
have
uttered
a
certain
name
our
comrade
sure
of
what
loveliness
waited
with
love
impatience
aflame
while
raglan
bulged
its
baronial
girth
to
roar
to
its
battlements
yule
and
song
retainers
loud
rollicked
in
wassail
and
mirth
where
the
mistletoe
the
vast
hearths
hung
and
holly
beberried
the
elden
wall
of
curious
oak
in
the
banqueting
hall
and
the
spits
i
trow
by
the
scullions
turned
the
snoring
logs
rich
steamed
and
burned
with
flesh
where
the
whole
was
roasted
and
the
flanks
and
the
roebuck
haunches
fat
tuns
of
ale
that
the
cellars
boasted
old
casks
of
wine
were
broached
for
paunches
of
the
vassals
that
reveled
in
bower
and
stall
pale
pages
who
diced
and
bluff
henchmen
who
or
swore
in
their
cups
while
lean
mastiffs
all
bones
of
the
feast
in
their
kennels
snarled
for
hortense
drink
drink
by
the
virgin
leave
were
wed
to
this
lovell
this
christmas
eve
was
she
long
did
she
come
by
that
postern
we
like
shadows
lurked
said
my
lord
sir
hugh
yon
tower
remember
that
casement
see
when
a
stealthy
light
in
its
slit
burns
blue
and
signals
thrice
slowly
thus
is
she
and
about
his
person
his
gaberdine
drew
for
the
wind
it
hugged
and
the
snow
beat
thro
did
she
come
we
had
watched
for
an
hour
or
twain
ere
that
light
burned
there
in
the
central
pane
and
was
flourished
thrice
and
departed
so
then
closer
we
packed
to
the
postern
portal
horses
and
all
in
the
stinging
snow
stiff
with
the
cold
was
immortal
minutes
we
waited
and
listened
shuddering
there
in
the
gusty
gale
whizzing
parapets
sifted
and
glistened
wild
drift
thro
battlements
hissed
in
a
veil
quoth
my
lord
sir
hugh
for
his
love
was
she
feels
for
the
spring
in
the
hidden
panel
the
tapestry
ah
thou
hast
pressed
it
sweet
how
black
gulps
open
the
secret
channel
now
cautiously
step
and
thy
bridal
garb
swirled
warm
with
a
mantle
o
fur
she
plants
one
foot
then
a
pause
on
the
stair
so
barb
so
if
the
tempest
that
barks
and
pants
would
throttle
itself
with
its
yelps
then
i
might
hear
but
one
footstep
echo
and
sing
down
the
ugly
there
is
her
fingers
try
the
massy
bolts
which
the
rust
makes
cling
but
ever
some
whim
of
the
wind
that
shook
the
clanging
ring
of
a
creaking
hook
in
the
buttress
or
wall
and
we
waited
so
till
the
east
grew
gray
did
she
come
ah
no
i
must
tell
you
why
and
enough
is
said
on
the
eve
of
the
marriage
she
fled
the
side
of
the
baron
the
bridegroom
too
she
fled
with
a
mischievous
laugh
hide
i
hide
seek
and
be
sure
to
seek
well
and
led
a
wild
chase
after
her
but
defied
all
search
for
a
score
and
ten
more
years
and
the
laughter
of
yule
was
changed
to
tears
but
they
searched
and
the
snow
was
bleared
with
the
glare
of
torches
that
hurried
thro
chamber
and
stair
and
tower
and
court
her
name
but
she
laughed
no
answer
and
never
came
so
over
the
channel
to
france
with
his
king
and
the
black
prince
sailed
to
the
wars
to
deaden
the
ache
of
the
mystery
hugh
that
spring
and
fell
at
poitiers
for
his
loss
lay
leaden
on
hope
and
his
life
was
a
weary
sadness
so
he
flung
it
away
with
a
very
gladness
and
the
baron
died
and
the
bridegroom
well
unlucky
that
bridegroom
sooth
to
tell
of
him
there
is
nothing
the
baron
died
the
last
of
the
strongbows
he
gramercy
and
the
clare
estate
with
its
wealth
and
its
pride
devolved
to
the
bloets
walter
or
percy
ten
years
and
a
score
thereafter
and
they
ransacked
the
old
castle
and
mark
one
day
in
a
lonesome
tower
uprummaged
a
chest
from
flanders
of
sinister
ebon
carved
sardonic
with
masks
an
olden
crest
gargoyle
faces
distorted
and
starved
fast
fixed
with
a
spring
which
they
forced
and
lo
when
they
opened
it
ha
hortense
or
no
fantastic
a
skeleton
jeweled
and
wreathed
with
flowers
of
dust
and
a
minever
about
it
hugged
which
quaint
richness
sheathed
of
a
bridal
raiment
and
lace
with
fur
i
have
given
such
years
of
my
life
yes
well
as
were
left
me
then
so
her
lover
hugh
for
such
time
breathed
as
it
took
one
to
tell
how
she
forever
deemed
false
was
true
he
have
known
how
it
was
for
you
see
in
groping
for
the
puny
spring
of
that
panel
hoping
and
fearing
as
nearer
and
nearer
grew
the
boisterous
scramble
why
out
she
blew
her
windy
taper
and
quick
in
this
chest
wary
would
lie
for
a
minute
mayhap
till
the
hurry
all
passed
but
the
pressed
ere
her
heart
was
aware
with
a
hungry
snap
on
the
to
my
friend
john
fox
you
remember
the
deep
mist
climbing
to
the
devil
den
blue
beneath
us
in
the
glen
and
above
us
amethyst
throbbed
and
circled
and
away
thro
the
opposite
torn
and
shattered
scurried
up
a
dewy
gray
vague
as
in
romance
we
saw
from
the
fog
one
riven
trunk
its
huge
horny
talons
shrunk
thrust
a
hungry
dragon
claw
and
we
climbed
two
hours
the
jellicoes
to
that
wooded
rock
that
shows
undulating
peaks
of
blue
the
vast
cumberlands
that
sleep
weighed
with
soaring
forests
far
to
the
concave
welkin
bar
leagues
on
leagues
of
purple
sweep
range
exalted
over
range
billowed
their
enormous
spines
and
we
heard
the
priestly
pines
hum
the
wisdom
of
their
change
we
were
sons
of
nature
then
she
had
taken
us
to
her
closer
drawn
by
brier
and
burr
there
on
lonely
devil
den
we
were
pupils
of
her
moods
taught
the
beauties
of
her
loins
in
those
coignes
love
in
her
eternal
woods
how
she
bore
or
flower
or
bud
pithed
the
wiry
in
the
long
vine
zeal
awoke
aye
to
climb
a
leafy
flood
her
waste
fantasies
of
birth
exudations
fair
dainty
fungi
everywhere
bulging
from
the
loamy
earth
things
crystals
clamily
exhaled
bulbous
and
scaled
colored
then
close
rings
of
the
indian
pipe
that
cleft
pink
and
white
the
woodland
lax
blossoms
of
a
natural
wax
the
brown
left
we
on
that
parched
precipice
stretched
beneath
the
chestnuts
burrs
breathed
the
balsam
of
the
firs
felt
the
blue
sky
like
a
kiss
soft
that
heaven
stainless
as
the
grand
woodlands
lunging
on
wound
majestic
in
the
sun
or
as
our
devotion
was
freedom
sat
there
cragged
we
saw
freedom
whom
hoarse
forests
sang
her
eyes
whence
sprang
audience
august
with
law
wildernesses
from
her
hips
sprung
the
giant
forests
there
tossed
the
cataracts
from
her
hair
thunders
lightened
from
her
lips
oft
some
scavenger
with
vane
motionless
above
we
knew
wheeled
thro
altitudes
of
blue
by
his
rapid
shadow
stain
or
some
cloud
of
sunny
white
puffed
a
lazy
drift
of
pearl
balmy
breezes
would
whirl
shot
with
coruscating
light
so
we
dreamed
an
hour
upon
those
warm
rocks
dry
lounged
beneath
long
leaves
that
dabbed
at
us
coins
of
shade
and
sun
then
arose
and
down
some
gorge
made
a
bowldered
torrent
broad
the
hurled
pathway
of
our
road
tumbled
down
the
mountain
large
at
that
which
you
know
where
flowers
spun
gay
in
the
sun
by
green
built
low
rested
from
our
hot
descent
one
deep
draught
of
cider
cool
unctuous
our
fierce
veins
to
dull
at
old
hix
eloquent
on
wolf
mountain
died
the
light
a
colossal
blossom
rayed
with
rent
petaled
clouds
that
played
a
calyxed
fury
bright
down
the
moist
vale
to
the
mining
camp
we
turned
thro
the
twilight
faint
discerned
with
its
crowded
cabins
pale
ah
those
nights
we
wandered
forth
on
some
path
when
the
moon
was
late
and
rathe
the
large
stars
sowed
south
and
north
clustered
bursting
heavens
down
and
the
milky
zodiac
rolled
athwart
the
belted
black
shone
and
in
dreams
we
sauntered
till
in
the
valley
pale
beneath
from
a
vapored
breath
to
faint
ghosts
there
gathered
still
grave
creations
weird
of
mist
then
we
knew
the
moonrise
near
as
with
necromance
the
air
pulsed
to
pearl
and
amethyst
shrilled
the
insects
of
the
dusk
grated
buzzed
and
strident
sung
till
each
leaf
seemed
tuned
and
strung
for
high
pixy
music
brusque
stealing
steps
and
stealthy
sighs
as
of
near
unhallowed
things
rustled
hair
or
fluttered
wings
seemed
about
us
then
the
eyes
of
plumed
phantom
warriors
burned
mesmeric
from
some
bush
mournful
in
the
goblin
hush
then
materialized
to
stars
mantled
mists
like
ambushed
braves
chiefed
by
some
swart
blackfoot
tall
stole
along
each
forest
wall
phosphorescent
moony
waves
then
the
moon
rose
from
some
cup
each
hill
bowl
magnetic
shine
mist
and
silence
poured
like
wine
brimmed
a
monster
goblet
up
ingot
from
lost
orient
mines
delved
by
humpbacked
gnomes
of
night
full
her
orb
loomed
nacreous
white
pine
mountain
druid
pines
as
thro
fragmentary
fleece
her
circumference
polished
broke
about
us
woke
myths
of
italy
and
greece
then
a
chanson
serenade
you
to
your
guitar
to
our
goddess
in
that
star
sang
from
the
glade
señorita
an
agate
black
thy
roguish
eyes
claim
no
proud
lineage
of
skies
no
velvet
blue
but
of
sweet
earth
rude
reckless
witchery
and
mirth
looped
in
thy
raven
hair
repose
a
hot
aroma
one
tame
rose
dies
envious
of
that
beauty
where
by
being
near
which
it
is
fair
thy
ears
two
dainty
bits
of
song
of
unpretending
charm
which
wrong
would
jewels
rich
whose
restless
fire
courts
coarse
attention
such
inspire
slim
hands
that
crumple
listless
lace
about
thy
white
breasts
swelling
grace
and
falter
at
thy
samite
throat
to
such
harmonious
efforts
float
seven
stars
stop
thy
balcony
cored
in
taunt
heaven
canopy
no
moon
flows
up
the
satin
night
in
raiment
spun
of
light
from
orange
orchards
dark
in
dew
vague
odorous
lips
the
west
wind
blew
or
thou
a
new
angelica
from
ariosto
cathay
oh
stoop
to
me
and
speaking
reach
my
soul
like
song
that
learned
low
speech
from
some
sad
instrument
who
knows
or
bloom
a
dulcimer
or
rose
leander
to
hero
brows
wan
thro
tresses
wet
with
sharp
rain
and
kisses
locks
loose
the
scatters
like
torn
wings
fierce
for
flight
cold
brows
whose
sadness
flatters
one
kiss
and
then
ii
can
this
thy
love
undo
me
when
in
the
heavy
waves
nay
it
must
make
unto
me
their
groaning
backs
but
slaves
for
its
magic
doth
indue
me
with
strength
all
their
graves
iii
weep
not
as
before
i
go
for
thou
wilt
follow
as
we
parted
a
something
dark
eyes
whence
cold
tears
started
gray
ghostly
arms
to
take
me
even
as
now
to
drag
me
their
weak
lover
to
caves
where
sirens
hover
deep
caves
the
dark
waves
cover
down
throat
and
hair
and
brow
iv
but
in
thy
sleep
shalt
follow
thy
bosom
fierce
to
mine
long
arms
wound
warm
and
hollow
in
sleep
in
sleep
shalt
follow
to
save
me
from
the
brine
dim
eyes
on
mine
divine
deep
breath
at
mine
like
wine
sweet
thou
with
kisses
to
dream
me
onward
home
white
in
white
foam
that
hisses
love
creature
safe
in
foam
what
hero
else
for
weeping
than
long
lost
hours
of
sleeping
and
dreams
where
thy
leander
stooping
sighs
no
dead
eyelids
drooping
no
harsh
hard
looks
accusing
no
curls
with
ocean
oozing
but
then
as
now
he
seems
as
can
make
him
thy
smile
which
is
a
might
a
hope
a
god
to
take
him
thro
all
this
hell
of
night
vi
then
where
thy
breasts
are
hollow
one
kiss
one
kiss
i
go
sweet
soul
a
kiss
to
follow
up
whence
thy
breasts
bud
hollow
cheeks
than
whiter
eyes
than
dark
waters
brighter
wherein
the
far
stars
glow
look
lovely
when
i
leave
thee
i
go
my
love
i
go
look
lovely
love
nor
grieve
thee
that
i
must
leave
thee
so
musagetes
for
the
mountains
hoarse
greetings
came
hollow
from
stormy
and
caves
and
i
heard
their
wild
cataracts
wallow
huge
bulks
in
long
spasms
of
waves
and
that
demon
said
lo
you
must
follow
and
our
path
is
myriads
of
graves
then
i
felt
that
the
black
earth
was
porous
and
rotten
with
worms
and
with
bones
and
i
knew
that
the
ground
that
now
bore
us
was
cadaverous
with
death
skeletons
and
i
saw
horrid
eyes
heard
sonorous
and
dolorous
gnashings
and
groans
but
the
night
of
the
tempest
and
thunder
the
might
of
the
terrible
skies
and
the
fire
of
hell
that
coiled
under
the
hollow
earth
smoulders
and
sighs
and
the
laughter
of
stars
and
their
wonder
mingled
and
mixed
in
its
eyes
and
we
clomb
and
the
moon
old
and
sterile
clomb
with
us
torrent
and
scar
and
i
yearned
towards
her
oceans
of
beryl
wan
mountains
and
cities
of
spar
is
not
well
that
one
said
you
in
peril
of
falling
and
failing
your
star
and
we
clomb
through
a
murmur
of
pinions
thin
rattle
of
talons
and
plumes
and
a
sense
as
of
boreal
dominions
clove
down
to
the
abysms
and
tombs
and
the
night
naked
ethiope
minions
swarmed
on
us
in
legions
of
glooms
and
we
clomb
till
we
stood
at
the
portal
of
the
uttermost
point
of
the
peak
and
it
led
with
a
step
more
than
mortal
far
upward
some
presence
to
seek
and
i
felt
that
this
love
was
immortal
this
love
which
had
made
me
so
weak
we
had
clomb
till
the
limbo
of
spirits
of
darkness
and
crime
deep
below
swung
nebular
nor
could
we
hear
its
lost
wailings
and
moanings
of
woe
for
we
stood
in
a
realm
that
inherits
a
vanquishing
virgin
of
snow
the
quarrel
could
i
divine
how
her
gray
eyes
gat
such
cold
haughtiness
of
skies
how
some
shadow
brown
dimmed
her
fair
forehead
wrath
a
frown
how
rippled
sunshine
blown
thro
air
tossed
scorn
her
eloquence
of
hair
how
to
a
folded
bud
again
she
drew
her
blossomed
lips
disdain
naught
deigning
save
eyes
utterance
which
quicker
reach
the
sense
then
afterwards
how
melted
there
the
austere
woman
to
one
tear
then
were
i
wise
to
know
how
grew
this
miracle
of
blue
how
god
makes
wild
flowers
out
of
dew
the
mood
o
the
earth
my
heart
is
high
is
high
my
dear
and
the
warm
wind
sunnily
blows
my
heart
is
high
with
a
mood
that
cheer
and
burns
like
a
rose
my
heart
is
high
is
high
my
dear
and
the
heaven
deep
skies
are
blue
my
heart
is
high
as
the
passionate
year
and
smiles
like
a
bud
in
dew
my
heart
my
heart
is
high
my
sweet
for
wild
is
the
smell
o
the
wood
that
gusts
in
the
breeze
with
a
pulse
o
heat
mad
heat
that
beats
like
a
blood
my
heart
my
heart
is
high
my
sweet
and
the
sense
of
summer
is
full
a
sense
of
summer
full
fields
of
wheat
full
forests
and
waters
cool
my
heart
is
high
is
high
my
heart
as
the
bee
that
groans
and
swinks
in
the
dabbled
flowers
that
dart
and
part
to
his
woolly
bulk
when
he
drinks
my
heart
is
high
is
high
my
heart
oh
sing
again
o
good
gray
bird
that
i
may
get
that
lilt
by
heart
and
fit
each
note
with
a
word
god
saints
i
tread
the
air
my
dear
flow
one
with
the
running
wind
and
the
stars
that
stare
i
swear
my
dear
right
soon
in
my
hair
i
find
to
live
high
up
a
life
of
mist
with
the
white
things
in
white
skies
with
their
limbs
of
pearl
and
of
amethyst
who
laugh
blue
humorous
eyes
or
to
creep
and
to
suck
like
an
elfin
thing
to
the
aching
heart
of
a
rose
in
the
harebell
ear
to
cling
and
swing
and
whisper
what
no
one
knows
to
live
on
wild
honey
as
fresh
as
thin
as
the
rain
that
left
in
a
flower
and
roll
forth
golden
from
feet
to
chin
in
the
danaë
shower
or
free
curve
back
the
throat
with
a
vigorous
look
at
the
blue
and
sing
right
staunch
with
a
lusty
note
like
the
hawk
hurled
where
he
flew
god
life
the
blood
of
the
earth
is
mine
and
the
mood
of
the
earth
i
take
and
brim
my
soul
with
her
wonderful
wine
and
sing
till
my
heart
doth
break
a
gray
day
i
long
vollies
of
wind
and
of
rain
and
the
rain
on
the
drizzled
pane
and
the
eve
falls
chill
and
murk
but
on
yesterday
eve
i
know
how
a
horned
moon
bow
stabbed
rosy
thro
gold
and
thro
glow
like
a
rich
barbaric
dirk
ii
now
thick
throats
of
the
snapdragons
who
hold
in
their
hues
cool
dawns
which
a
healthy
yellow
paints
are
filled
with
a
sweet
rain
fine
of
a
jaunty
jubilant
shine
a
faery
vat
of
rare
wine
which
the
honey
thinly
taints
iii
now
dabble
the
poppies
shrink
and
the
coxcomb
and
the
pink
while
the
candytuft
damp
crown
droops
dribbled
low
bowed
i
the
wet
and
long
spikes
o
the
mignonette
little
open
set
which
the
dripping
o
dew
drags
down
iv
stretched
taunt
on
the
blades
of
grass
like
a
glass
which
the
spun
the
web
where
the
round
rain
clings
in
its
middle
sagging
swings
a
hammock
for
elfin
things
when
the
stars
succeed
the
sun
and
mark
where
the
pale
gourd
grows
up
high
as
the
clambering
rose
how
that
is
pressed
to
the
wide
leaf
and
i
know
where
the
red
wasps
hide
and
the
wild
bees
who
defied
the
first
strong
gusts
distressed
vi
yet
i
feel
that
the
gray
will
blow
aside
for
an
afterglow
and
a
breeze
on
a
sudden
toss
drenched
boughs
to
a
pattering
athwart
the
red
dusk
in
a
big
drops
heard
hard
on
each
on
the
grass
and
the
flowering
moss
vii
and
then
for
a
minute
may
be
a
pearl
hollow
worn
of
the
sea
a
glimmer
of
moon
will
smile
cool
stars
rinsed
clean
on
the
dusk
a
freshness
of
gathering
musk
the
showery
lawns
as
brusk
as
spice
from
an
indian
isle
carmen
la
tall
dragoons
in
andalusian
afternoons
with
ogling
eye
and
compliment
smiled
on
you
as
along
you
went
some
sleepy
street
of
old
seville
twirled
with
a
military
skill
moustaches
buttoned
uniforms
of
spanish
yellow
bowed
your
charms
proud
wicked
head
and
hair
whence
your
mantilla
half
thrown
back
discovered
shoulders
and
bold
breast
bohemian
brown
and
you
were
dressed
in
some
short
skirt
of
gipsy
red
of
smuggled
stuff
thence
stockings
dead
white
silk
exposed
with
many
a
hole
thro
which
your
plump
legs
roguish
stole
a
fleshly
look
and
tiny
toes
in
red
morocco
shoes
with
bows
of
scarlet
ribbons
daintily
you
walked
by
me
and
i
did
see
your
oblique
eyes
your
sensuous
lip
that
gnawed
the
rose
you
once
did
flip
at
bashful
jose
nose
while
loud
laughed
the
guant
guards
among
the
crowd
and
in
your
brazen
chemise
thrust
heaved
with
the
swelling
of
your
bust
that
bunch
of
white
acacia
blooms
whiffed
past
my
nostrils
hot
perfumes
as
in
a
cool
i
ate
an
ice
with
mérimée
dark
carmencita
you
passed
gay
all
holiday
bedizenéd
a
new
mantilla
on
your
head
a
crimson
dress
bespangled
fierce
and
crescent
gold
hung
in
your
ears
shone
wrought
morisco
and
each
shoe
cordovan
leather
spangled
blue
glanced
merriment
and
from
large
arms
to
ancles
all
your
charms
blew
flutterings
and
glitterings
of
satin
bands
and
beaded
strings
and
each
arm
fair
thigh
one
fold
and
graceful
wrists
a
twisted
gold
coiled
serpents
tails
fixed
in
the
head
glossy
red
in
flowers
and
trimmings
to
the
jar
of
mandolin
and
low
guitar
you
in
the
grated
danced
the
curled
coxcombs
flirting
row
rang
pleased
applause
i
saw
you
dance
with
wily
motion
and
glad
glance
voluptuous
the
wild
where
every
movement
was
a
kiss
of
elegance
delicious
wound
in
your
basque
tambourine
dull
sound
or
as
the
ebon
castanets
clucked
out
dry
time
in
unctuous
jets
saw
angry
jose
thro
the
grate
glare
on
us
a
pale
face
of
hate
when
some
indecent
colonel
there
presumed
too
lewdly
for
his
ear
some
still
night
in
seville
the
street
two
shadows
meet
flash
sabres
crossed
within
the
moon
clash
rapidly
a
dead
dragoon
disenchantment
of
death
hush
she
is
dead
tread
gently
as
the
light
foots
dim
the
weary
room
thou
shalt
behold
look
in
death
ermine
pomp
of
awful
white
pale
passion
of
pulseless
slumber
virgin
cold
bold
beautiful
youth
proud
as
heroic
might
death
and
how
death
hath
made
it
vastly
old
old
earth
she
is
now
energy
of
birth
glad
wings
hath
fledged
and
tried
them
suddenly
the
eyes
that
held
have
freed
their
narrow
mirth
their
sparks
of
spirit
which
made
this
to
be
shine
fixed
in
rarer
jewels
not
of
earth
far
fairylands
beyond
some
silent
sea
a
sod
is
this
whence
what
were
once
those
eyes
will
grow
blue
in
what
happy
air
some
weed
with
flossy
blossoms
will
surprise
haply
what
summer
with
her
affluent
hair
blush
roses
bask
those
cheeks
and
the
wise
skies
will
know
her
dryad
to
what
young
oak
fair
the
chastity
of
death
hath
touched
her
so
no
dreams
of
life
can
reach
her
in
such
rest
no
dreams
the
mind
exhausted
here
below
sleep
built
within
the
romance
of
her
breast
how
she
will
sleep
like
musick
quickening
slow
dark
the
dead
germs
to
golden
life
caressed
low
musick
thin
as
winds
that
lyre
the
grass
smiting
thro
red
roots
harpings
and
the
sound
of
elfin
revels
when
the
wild
dews
glass
globes
of
concentric
beauty
on
the
ground
for
showery
clouds
tepid
nights
that
pass
the
prayer
in
harebells
and
faint
foxgloves
crowned
so
if
she
dead
thou
she
is
not
dead
disturb
her
not
she
lies
so
lost
in
sleep
the
soul
its
shell
hath
fled
her
presence
drifts
about
us
and
the
deep
is
yet
unvoyaged
and
she
smiles
weep
not
nor
sigh
thou
wouldst
not
have
weep
to
principles
of
passion
and
of
pride
to
trophied
circumstance
and
specious
law
stale
saws
of
life
with
scorn
now
flung
aside
from
mercy
throne
and
justice
thou
draw
her
hope
in
hope
and
chastity
pale
bride
in
holiest
love
of
holy
without

the
anguish
of
the
living
merciless
mad
bitter
cruelty
unto
the
grave
wrings
the
dear
dead
with
tenfold
heart
distress
earth
chaining
love
bound
by
the
lips
that
rave
if
thou
hast
sorrow
let
thy
sorrow
bless
that
power
of
death
of
death
our
selfless
slave
unjust
he
is
not

thou
not
all
all
that
thou
ever

when
this
dull

so
heartless
blasted
now
flushed
spiritual
a
restless
vassal
of

this

disenchanted
that

won
with

what
bootless

that

it
not
with

the
three
urgandas
cast
on
sleep
there
came
to
me
three
urgandas
and
the
sea
in
lost
lands
of
briogne
sounded
moaning
moaning
cloudy
clad
in
awful
white
and
each
face
a
lucid
light
rayed
and
blossomed
out
of
night
and
a
wind
was
groaning
in
my
sleep
i
saw
them
rest
each
a
long
hand
at
her
breast
a
soft
flame
that
lulls
the
west
and
the
sea
was
moaning
moaning
hair
like
hoarded
ingots
rolled
down
white
shoulders
glossy
gold
streaks
of
molten
moonlight
cold
and
a
wind
was
groaning
rosy
each
high
brow
bent
starry
gold
that
sent
barbs
of
fire
redolent
and
the
sea
was
moaning
moaning
their
burning
crowns
their
eyes
burned
like
southern
stars
the
skies
rock
in
shattered
storm
that
flies
and
a
wind
was
groaning
wisdom
eyes
of
lurid
dark
and
each
red
mouth
like
a
spark
flashed
and
laughed
off
care
and
cark
and
the
sea
was
moaning
moaning
mouths
for
song
and
lips
to
kiss
lips
for
hate
and
mouths
to
hiss
lips
that
fashioned
hell
or
bliss
and
the
wind
was
groaning
tall
as
stately
virgins
dead
tapers
lit
at
feet
and
head
whom
latin
prayers
are
said
and
the
sea
was
moaning
moaning
or
as
vampire
women
who
buried
beauties
rise
and
woo
youths
whose
blood
they
suck
like
dew
and
a
wind
was
groaning
then
the
west
one
said
to
me
thou
hast
slept
thus
holily
while
seven
sands
ran
secretly
and
the
sea
was
moaning
moaning
earth
hath
served
thee
like
a
slave
serving
us
who
found
thee
brave
fearless
of
or
life
or
grave
and
a
wind
was
groaning
know
she
smote
my
brow
a
pain
riddling
arrows
rent
my
brain
ceased
and
earth
fell
some
vast
strain
and
the
sea
was
moaning
moaning
then
i
understood
all
thought
what
was
life
the
spirit
fraught
love
and
hate
how
worlds
were
wrought
and
a
wind
was
groaning
then
the
east
one
said
to
me
thou
hast
wandered
wearily
by
what
sea
and
the
sea
was
moaning
moaning
know
the
things
thou
hast
not
seen
life
and
law
and
love
and
teen
things
that
be
and
have
not
been
and
the
wind
was
groaning
see
her
voice
sung
like
a
lyre
throbs
of
thunderous
desire
then
the
iron
sight
like
fire
and
the
sea
was
moaning
moaning
burst
the
inner
eyelids
which
husked
clairvoyance
with
a
twitch
rose
and
i
with
light
was
rich
and
a
wind
was
groaning
then
i
saw
the
eyes
of
sleep
nerves
of
life
and
veins
that
leap
laws
of
entity
the
deep
and
the
sea
was
moaning
moaning
orbs
and
eons
springs
of
power
circumstance
blown
like
a
flower
time
the
second
of
an
hour
and
the
wind
was
groaning
to
the
central
third
one
full
balanced
being
beautiful
heart
to
hearken
made
a
lull
and
the
sea
was
moaning
moaning
as
she
sternly
stooped
to
me
thou
dost
know
and
thou
canst
see
what
thou
art
arise
and
be
and
the
wind
was
groaning
to
my
mouth
hot
lips
she
pressed
and
my
famished
soul
thrice
blessed
quaffed
her
radiance
and
caressed
and
vague
seas
were
moaning
moaning
mounted
fled
soared
to
love
with
her
who
said
thou
dost
live
and
thou
art
dead
far
off
winds
were
groaning
the
brush
sparrow
ere
wild
haws
looming
in
the
glooms
build
bolted
drifts
of
breezy
blooms
and
in
the
whistling
hollow
there
the
bends
as
brown
and
bare
as
buxom
roxy
arm
from
some
slick
hickory
or
larch
sighed
the
sodden
meads
of
march
the
sad
heart
thrills
and
reddens
warm
to
hear
thee
braving
the
rough
storm
frail
courier
of
powers
rebelling
sap
in
trunks
and
flowers
love

come
heralding
o
sweet
among
bleak
bowers
thou
pursuivant
of
spring
ii
sob
the
woodland
cascades
still
down
bloomless
ledges
of
the
hill
and
gray
gaunt
clouds
like
harpies
hang
in
harpy
heavens
and
swoop
and
clang
sharp
beaks
and
talons
of
the
wind
black
scowl
the
forests
and
unkind
the
far
fields
as
the
near
while
song
seems
murdered
and
all
passion
wrong
one
wild
frog
only
in
the
thaw
of
spawny
pools
wakes
cold
and
raw
expires
a
melancholy
bass
and
stops
as
if
bewildered
then
along
the
frowning
wood
again
flung
in
the
thin
wind
fangy

in
red
woolly

of
bannered

her

fragrant

weary

how
sad
the
journey
once
so
sweet
dreams
crowned
with
thorns
have
passed
thee
on
the
way
and
beauties
with
bare
limbs
and
torn
tall
holy
hours
their

dull
wan
and
worn
slaves
manacled
whom
lashed
the
brutal
day

sorrow
sat
beside
a
sea
so
wide
that
shoreless
heaven
unto
one
little
star
upon
the
brink
of
night
seems
not
so
far
and
on
her
feet
the
frail
foams
tossing
sighed
she
her
rent
hair
dressed
like
a
siren
full
of
weedy
waifs
and
strays
of
moaning
shells
streaked
with
the
glimmering

and
foamy
bells
loomed
a
pale
utterance
most
beautiful
and
thou
shall
love
me
sorrow
i
but
she
turned
her
vast
eyes
upon
me
and
no
more
their
melancholy
language
clove
the
core
of
my
fast
heart
and
in
mine
ears
the
sea
along
gaunt
crags
yearned
grief
groaned
the
hard
headlands
with
the
wings
of
storm
huge
thunder
shook
the
and
alarm
gnashed
her
thin
fangs
from
hissing
reef
to
reef
so
to
the
hills
aweary
i
did
beyond
a
reach
of
sunlight
and
slim
flowers
where
hope
an
amaranth
and
tearless
hours
long
lilies
lived
whose
hearts
stiff
gold
did
burn
and
there
curled
joy
clinked
their
chaste
chalices
distilled
at
dusk
poured
bubbling
dewy
wine
divine
elixir
off
his
lips
divine
tossed
the
fleet
rapture
to
the
golden
lees
and
so
lolled
dazed
with
pleasure
and
i
said
yield
me
the
lily
thou
hast
drained
that
i
this
hollow
thirst
may
kill
and
so
not
die
to
me
he
laughed
i
yield
it
but
was
dead
and
each
blown
reach
and
eminence
of
blooms
flushed
long
low
gurgling
murmurs
like
a
sea
and
laughed
bright
lips
that
flashed
white
teeth
of
glee
in
pearly
flower
on
flower
pure
perfumes
gasped
the
rolled
fields
and
the
eminence
i
journeyed
joyless
thro
a
that
budding
kisses
curled
with
blown
desire
clasped
me
and
claimed
me
tho
i
spurned
it
hence
then
came
unto
a
land
of
thorns
and
weeds
and
dust
and
thirst
which
a
songless
sky
hoarse
with
lean
vultures
scowled
a
scoffing
lie
where
cold
snakes
hissed
among
dead
rattling
reeds
and
there
i
saw
the
bony
brow
of
hate
vile
vicious
sneers
the
eyes
of
shriveled
scorn
among
the
writhing
briers
each
a
thorn
of
cavernous
hunger
barbed
with
burning
fate
they
thro
her
locks
of
raveled
dark
stung
a
stark
horror
and
i
felt
my
heart
freeze
wedged
with
ice
to
dullness
part
by
part
and
knew
hate
coiled
toward
me
yet
stood
stark
fell
seeing
on
the
happy
happy
hills
above
that
den
of
dust
and
thorny
thirst
the
bastioned
walls
of
love
in
glory
burst
built
by
sweet
glades
of
poesy
and
rills
o
life
i
had
not
life
enough
to
strive
o
hope
i
had
not
hope
enough
to
dream
death
drew
me
to
him
and
to
sigh
did
seem
love
love
thou
canst
not
reach
her
and
yet
live
for
sorrow
joy
and
hate
and
scorn
are
bound
about
thee
girdling
so
thy
lips
are
dumb
and
fame
ah
fame
her
towers
are
but
a
tomb
on
dwindling
heights
of
starry
ground
and
thou
art
done
and
being
done
must
die
endeavor
being
dead
and
energy
slain
a
wild
bird
that
beat
bars
to
be
free
despairing
perished

life
a

consanguined

seek
no
sighing
shadows
with
dead
no
sleepy
sorrows
whose
wan
eyes
are
weak
with
vanished
vigils
melancholy
made
forlorn
in
lands
of
sin
and
saddening
shade

stab
their
