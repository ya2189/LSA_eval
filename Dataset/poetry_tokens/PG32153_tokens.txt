preface
a
few
words
of
preface
seem
necessary
in
sending
out
this
little
book
it
is
to
be
looked
on
as
the
product
of
the
life
of
a
social
worker
in
england
in
his
travels
and
in
australia
the
of
the
first
desperation
or
if
any
hope
then
a
friend
once
reported
to
me
a
saying
of
matthew
that
he
did
not
believe
in
any
man
of
intelligence
taking
a
desperate
view
of
the
social
problem
in
england
i
am
afraid
that
saying
relegates
me
to
the
ranks
of
the
fools
but
i
am
content
to
remain
there
i
believe
that
never
since
which
is
the
date
of
the
revolt
has
england
presented
such
a
spectacle
of
the
happiness
of
the
tens
of
the
misery
of
the
millions
it
is
not
by
any
means
the
artisan
or
the
general
or
the
agricultural
labourer
who
is
the
only
sufferer
all
society
groans
under
the
slavery
of
stupendous
toil
and
a
pittance
wage
the
negro
slavery
of
the
southern
states
of
america
was
better
than
the
white
slavery
of
all
over
the
earth
but
more
particularly
in
europe
and
in
america
capitalism
is
built
on
the
dreadful
wrong
of
recompensing
labour
not
according
to
the
worth
of
its
work
but
according
to
the
worth
of
its
members
in
the
market
of
unlimited
competition
and
that
soon
comes
to
mean
the
payment
of
what
will
hold
body
and
soul
together
when
in
the
enjoyment
of
health
and
strength
landlordism
is
built
on
the
dreadful
wrong
of
sharing
with
capitalism
the
plunder
of
labour
why
are
rents
high
in
australia
because
here
labour
is
scarcer
its
wages
correspondingly
higher
and
therefore
landlordism
steps
in
to
filch
from
labour
its
comforts
and
once
more
reduce
it
to
the
necessities
of
existence
the
american
slavers
had
to
spend
more
in
housing
and
keeping
any
fixed
number
of
their
slaves
in
serviceable
condition
than
capitalism
spends
in
wages
capitalism
and
landlordism
like
good
christian
institutions
leave
the
living
to
keep
alive
their
living
and
the
dead
to
bury
their
dead
this
can
not
continue
for
ever
at
least
all
the
intelligent
portion
of
the
community
will
grow
to
see
the
injustice
and
attempt
to
abolish
it
but
when
will
the
great
mass
of
unintelligent
people
who
have
won
a
large
enough
share
of
the
plunder
of
their
fellows
to
minister
to
their
own
will
these
also
awake
and
see
england
will
realize
the
desperation
of
her
social
problem
when
its
desperation
is
shown
her
by
fire
and
and
not
till
then
what
shall
teach
her
her
sins
to
herself
is
what
is
even
now
teaching
her
her
sins
to
ireland
i
make
no
apology
for
several
poems
in
the
first
part
which
are
fierce
which
are
even
as
i
felt
i
wrote
and
i
will
not
lessen
the
truth
of
what
inspired
those
feelings
by
eliminating
or
suppressing
the
record
of
them
rather
let
me
ask
you
whoever
you
be
to
imagine
what
the
cause
was
from
the
effect
in
one
who
was
unhappily
born
and
bred
into
the
dominant
class
and
whose
chief
care
and
joy
in
life
was
in
the
pursuit
of
a
culture
which
draws
back
instinctively
from
the
violent
and
the
terrible
i
will
go
further
i
will
arraign
my
country
and
my
day
because
their
iniquity
would
not
let
me
follow
out
the
laws
of
my
nature
which
were
for
luminosity
and
quiet
for
the
wide
and
genial
view
but
made
me
arms
against
a
sea
of
troubles
hoping
only
too
often
opposing
to
end
no
we
make
no
apology
for
bloody
sweat
and
for
tears
of
fire
wrung
out
of
us
in
the
gethsemane
and
on
the
calvary
of
our
country
we
make
no
apology
to
those
whom
we
have
the
right
to
curse
in
the
second
and
there
the
record
of
a
short
trip
in
the
sight
of
the
sin
which
england
has
committed
not
only
against
herself
against
ireland
against
scotland
but
against
india
against
china
against
the
sweetest
and
gentlest
people
in
the
earth
the
sight
of
this
and
of
the
signs
of
doom
the
punishment
for
the
abuse
of
the
greatest
trust
any
modern
nation
has
had
given
to
her
inspires
a
hatred
which
only
that
punishment
can
appease
in
the
third
is
neither
ferocity
nor
its
is
hope
hope
that
dreads
but
does
not
despair
i
may
add
that
in
this
edition
i
have
sacrificed
all
merely
personal
aspects
of
the
poems
to
attempt
to
give
the
book
a
more
complete
totality
we
know
well
enough
that
allowance
will
rarely
be
made
for
any
of
these
things
that
our
plea
for
comprehension
will
too
often
be
an
idle
one
none
the
less
we
make
it
for
the
sake
of
those
who
are
willing
to
attempt
to
realize
the
social
problem
and
to
seek
within
themselves
what
they
can
do
for
its
solution
we
have
no
care
whatever
as
to
what
view
they
take
of
it
let
them
be
with
us
or
against
us
it
matters
not
if
only
they
will
make
this
effort
if
only
they
will
ponder
it
in
their
hearts
out
of
a
hundred
of
us
are
concerned
in
this
problem
we
are
all
of
us
true
sons
of
labour
who
have
suffered
the
robbery
of
the
wages
of
competition
one
word
more
the
australian
is
apt
to
deprecate
the
socialism
of
the
european
or
the
american
the
darker
aspects
of
the
european
or
american
civilization
are
not
striking
here
they
are
here
they
are
more
than
incipient
very
much
more
but
they
are
not
striking
let
such
an
one
pause
speak
of
that
which
we
do
know
and
for
the
rest
not
only
do
we
bid
that
has
ears
to
hear
but
that
has
eyes
to
brothers
all
over
the
earth
brothers
and
sisters
you
of
that
silent
company
whose
speech
is
only
in
the
unknown
deeds
of
love
the
unknown
devotions
the
unknown
heroisms
it
is
to
you
we
speak
our
heart
is
against
your
heart
you
can
feel
it
beat
soul
speaks
to
soul
through
lips
whose
utterance
is
a
need
in
your
room
alone
in
your
lonely
walks
in
the
still
hours
of
day
and
night
we
will
be
with
you
we
will
speak
with
you
we
will
plead
with
you
for
these
piteous
ones
in
the
evening
trees
you
shall
hear
the
sound
of
our
weeping
our
sobs
shall
shake
in
the
wind
of
wintry
nights
we
are
the
spirit
of
those
piteous
ones
the
wronged
the
oppressed
the
robbed
the
murdered
and
we
bid
you
open
your
warm
heart
your
soul
to
us
we
will
thrill
you
with
the
clarion
of
hate
and
defiance
and
despair
in
the
tempest
of
land
and
sea
you
shall
listen
to
us
there
also
we
will
touch
your
eyes
and
lips
with
fire
no
we
will
never
let
you
go
till
you
are
ours
and
theirs
and
you
too
o
sufferers
you
too
shall
stay
with
us
and
shall
have
comfort
look
we
have
suffered
we
have
agonized
we
have
longed
to
hasten
the
hour
of
rest
but
beyond
the
darkness
there
is
light
beyond
the
turbulence
peace
and
be
true
to
one
bid
you
this
book
give
this
to
you
or
or
you
may
wages
are
not
the
worth
of
your
a
fraction
of
wages
are
the
minimum
which
you
and
those
like
by
the
desire
for
life
in
the
dreadful
struggle
consent
to
take
from
your
employers
to
able
thus
to
rob
give
it
you
the
hope
that
you
may
see
how
you
are
being
capital
that
is
won
by
paying
you
your
competition
wages
is
rent
that
is
won
by
the
increased
value
of
land
that
is
owing
to
the
industry
of
us
the
capitalist
and
landowner
who
the
master
or
mistress
who
work
you
from
morning
to
domineer
over
you
as
servants
and
despise
what
is
the
men
and
women
whose
sole
title
to
this
they
have
the
audacity
and
skill
to
plunder
you
the
simplicity
and
folly
not
to
see
it
and
to
submit
to
give
this
book
you
the
hope
that
you
may
at
last
realize
in
your
own
fashion
never
cease
the
effort
to
make
your
realize
give
it
you
the
hope
that
you
may
formally
enrol
yourself
in
the
ranks
of
the
army
of
the
that
you
will
offer
up
the
best
that
has
been
granted
you
of
heart
and
soul
and
mind
towards
the
working
out
of
that
better
time
victorious
silence
our
drums
and
our
our
cannons
to
their
place
of
solemnly
disarming
citizens
once
more
soldiers
of
the
army
of
the
songs
of
the
army
of
the
night
are
the
poor
in
spirit
blessed
are
the
mourners
are
the
salt
of
the
good
tidings
as
by
matthew
proem
in
the
black
night
along
the
roads
amid
the
threatening
boughs
and
ghastly
streams
hark
sounds
that
gird
the
darknesses
like
goads
murmurs
and
rumours
and
reverberant
dreams
tramplings
breaths
movements
and
a
little
marching
of
the
army
of
the
the
stricken
men
the
mad
are
keeping
no
more
their
places
in
the
ditches
or
holes
but
rise
and
join
us
and
the
women
weeping
beside
the
roadways
rise
like
fill
up
the
ranks
what
shimmers
there
so
bright
bayonets
of
the
army
of
the
fill
up
the
ranks
we
march
in
steadfast
column
in
wavering
lines
yet
forming
more
and
more
men
women
children
sombre
silent
solemn
rank
follows
rank
like
billows
to
the
shore
dawnwards
we
tramp
towards
the
day
and
light
and
army
of
the
i
in
the
camp
this
is
a
tent
gathers
here
enter
and
see
and
listen
on
the
ground
men
sit
or
stand
enter
or
disappear
dark
faces
and
deep
voices
all
around
one
answers
you
ask
who
gathers
here
companions
generals
we
have
none
nor
chief
what
need
is
there
the
plan
is
all
so
the
hope
the
grim
relief
for
us
all
and
clothes
and
roofs
come
first
the
means
to
gain
them
this
our
leaguered
band
the
hatred
of
the
robber
rich
accursed
keeps
foes
together
makes
fools
understand
the
faith
the
hope
points
to
the
dawning
hour
when
all
shall
be
but
one
the
man
condemned
shall
fit
the
rope
around
the
neck
and
both
be
free
sun
then
rises
on
a
happier
land
where
wealth
and
labour
sound
but
as
one
word
we
drill
we
train
we
arm
our
leaguered
band
what
is
there
more
to
tell
you
have
not
heard
this
is
a
tent
they
gather
here
resolute
stern
menacing
on
the
ground
they
sit
or
stand
enter
or
disappear
dark
faces
and
deep
voices
all
around
let
him
who
toils
enjoy
fruit
of
his
toiling
let
him
whom
sweats
annoy
no
more
be
spoiling
for
we
would
have
it
be
that
weak
or
stronger
not
he
who
works
but
he
who
works
hunger
drill
when
hard
done
scant
meal
partaken
out
we
steal
each
one
weariless
unshaken
in
small
reeking
squares
garbaged
plots
we
gather
little
knots
and
pairs
brother
sister
father
then
the
word
is
given
in
their
silent
places
under
lowering
heaven
range
our
faces
now
we
march
and
wheel
in
our
clumsy
line
shouldering
sticks
for
steel
thoughts
like
bitter
brine
drill
drill
drill
and
drill
it
is
only
thus
conquer
yet
we
will
those
conquered
us
patience
sisters
mothers
we
must
not
forget
dear
dead
fathers
brothers
they
must
teach
us
yet
in
that
hour
we
see
the
hour
of
our
desire
what
shall
their
slayers
be
the
stubble
to
the
evening
hymn
in
the
hovels
sow
the
fertile
seed
and
then
we
reap
it
we
thresh
the
golden
grain
we
knead
the
bread
others
that
eat
are
glad
in
store
they
keep
it
while
we
hunger
outside
with
hearts
like
lead
hew
the
stone
and
saw
it
rear
the
city
others
inhabit
there
in
pleasant
ease
we
have
no
thing
to
ask
of
them
save
pity
no
answer
they
to
give
but
what
they
please
it
for
ever
fathers
say
and
mothers
that
we
must
toil
and
never
know
the
light
is
it
for
ever
sisters
say
and
brothers
that
they
must
grind
us
dead
here
in
the
night
we
who
sow
reap
knead
shall
we
not
also
have
strength
and
pleasure
of
the
food
we
make
o
we
who
hew
build
deck
shall
we
not
also
the
happiness
that
we
have
given
partake
in
the
street
lord
you
have
done
well
we
say
it
you
are
dead
and
of
the
man
that
with
the
right
hand
takes
less
than
the
left
hand
gives
let
it
be
said
he
has
done
something
for
our
wretched
sakes
for
those
to
whom
you
gave
their
daily
bread
rancid
with
their
drink
putrid
with
we
bow
our
head
grateful
as
the
great
hearse
goes
by
and
think
yes
you
have
fed
the
flesh
and
starved
the
soul
of
thousands
of
us
you
have
taught
too
well
the
rich
are
little
gods
beyond
control
save
of
your
big
god
of
the
heaven
and
hell
we
thank
you
this
was
pretty
once
and
right
now
it
wears
rather
thin
my
lord
good
night
is
that
the
cry
then
we
have
heard
it
oft
of
yore
once
it
had
we
think
a
meaning
let
us
hear
it
now
no
more
we
have
read
what
history
tells
us
of
its
heroes
martyrs
too
doubtless
they
were
very
splendid
but
not
for
me
and
you
there
were
greeks
who
fought
and
perished
won
from
persians
deathless
graves
had
lived
then
aware
that
have
been
those
same
slaves
then
a
roman
came
who
loved
us
cæsar
gave
men
tongues
and
swords
crying
they
fought
him
cato
and
his
lords
when
give
a
broader
franchise
lift
the
mangled
nations
bowed
crying
they
killed
him
brutus
and
his
pandar
crowd
we
have
read
what
history
tells
us
o
the
truthful
memory
clings
tacitus
the
chartered
liar
gloating
over
poisoned
kings
the
stale
cry
echoes
past
snug
homesteads
tinsel
thrones
over
smoking
fields
and
hovels
murdered
bleaching
bones
the
cry
that
mocked
us
madly
toiling
in
our
living
graves
when
sent
up
the
chorus
never
shall
be
we
care
not
for
it
what
we
care
food
clothes
homes
for
our
dear
ones
toiling
waiting
for
the

that
never
comes

asks
you
my
lord
you
who
know
the
points
desirable
in
such
she
does
not
say
that
she
is
perfect
true
not
too
pleasant
to
the
sight
or
touch
but
are
you
her
cheeks
are
rather
fallen
in
a
mist
glazes
her
eyes
for
all
their
hungry
glare
her
lips
do
not
breathe
balmy
when
kissed
and
yet
not
more
loathsome
than
i
swear
your
grandmother
at
whist
my
lord
she
will
admit
and
need
not
frame
excuses
for
herself
that
not
chaste
first
a
young
lover
had
her
then
she
came
from
one
to
arms
with
haste
your
mother
did
the
same
moreover
since
married
once
or
twice
sold
herself
for
certain
things
at
night
to
sell
body
for
the
highest
price
of
social
ease
and
power
all
girls
think
right
your
sister
did
it
thrice
what
not

curse
at
her
instead
her
children
are
alone
at
home
quite
near
these
winter
streets
so
gay
at
nights

the
wanton
out
could
not
children
cry
for

the
girls
of

girls
we
love
you
and
love
asks
you
to
give
again
that
which
draws
it
above
beautiful
without
stain
give
us
weariless
faith
in
our
cause
pure
passionate
dearer
than
life
and
death
dear
as
the
love
it
give
to
the
man
who
turns
traitrous
hands
or
forlorn
back
from
the
plough
that
burns
give
him
pitiless
scorn
let
him
know
that
no

would
bear
him
a
fearless
child
to
hate
and
loathe
the
life
of
a
leprous
father
defiled
love
you

she
went
along
the
road
her
baby
in
her
arms
the
night
and
its
alarms
made
deadlier
her
load
her
shrunken
breasts
were
dry
she
felt
the
hunger
bite
she
lay
down
in
the
night
she
and
the
child
to
die
but
it
would
wail
and
wail
and
wail
she
crept
away
she
had
no
word
to
say
yet
still
she
heard
the
wail
she
took
a
jaggèd
stone
she
wished
it
to
be
dead
she
beat
it
on
the
head
it
only
gave
one
moan
she
has
no
word
to
say
she
sits
there
in
the
night
the
east
sky
glints
with
light
and
it
is
christmas
day
is
it
we
toil
go
all
the
do
we
produce
for
our
pangs
and
why
it
is
we
toil
so
is
it
because
like
sheep
since
our
fathers
sought
the
shears
we
the
same
course
keep
where
go
all
the
gains
well
it
must
be
confessed
first
the
landlords
take
the
rent
and
the
masters
take
the
rest
what
do
we
produce
for
it
gentlemen
then
imitation
snobs
be
like
the
gentlemen
it
for
such
as
we
suffer
and
vicious
that
why
on
the

royal
prince
of
pheasants
and
and
yes
why
my
christian
friends
they
slave

lives
no
i
am
not

here
and
i
have
brought
my
lute

in
my
hand
to
see
you
and
to
sing
of
all
you
suffer
to
the
great
world
and
make
it
understand
one
of
those
robbed
you
you
a
sixpence
in

and
you
call
her
all
her
charming
smile
and

no
i

oh
no
come
here
with

indignant
pity
like

to
try
and

you
little
will
be

you
go
back
whence
you
have
such
little
time
our
rude
camp
we
drill
the
whole

we
return
from
out
the
serried
listen
to
your
pretty
my
lord
at

you
have
it
now
we
know
not
a
phrase
justice
an
idle
show
your
life
ran
red
with
murder
green
with
lust
blood
has
washed
blood
clean
and
in
the
final
dust
your
carrion
will
be
purified
yet
see
though
your
body
perish
for
your
soul
shall
be
an
immortality
of
infamy
not
when
i
am
here
in
these
homeless
homes
where
sin
and
shame
and
disease
and
foul
death
comes
not
when
heart
and
brain
would
be
still
and
forget
men
and
women
and
children
dragged
down
to
the
pit
but
when
i
hear
them
declaiming
of
and
the
gentleman
and
the
bourgeois
that
a
sombre
hateful
desire
burns
up
slow
in
my
breast
to
wreck
the
great
guilty
temple
and
give
us
rest
belgravia
by
night
on
foxes
have
holes
and
the
birds
of
the
air
have
nests
but
where
shall
the
heads
of
the
sons
of
men
be
laid
be
laid
the
cold
corpse
the
sightless
and
yet
can
not
make
it
but
can
not
wake
it
shall
the
heads
of
the
sons
of
jesus
where
is
poor
jesus
gone
he
sits
with
dives
now
and
not
even
the
crumbs
are
flung
to
lazarus
below
where

gone
is
he
with
magdalen
he
doles
her
one
by
one
her
wages
of
shame
where
is
poor
jesus
gone
the
good
samaritan
what
does
he
there
alone
he
stabs
the
wounded
man
where
is
poor
jesus
gone
the
lamb
they
sacrificed
made
god
of
his
carrion
and
labelled
it
parallels

a
pistol
to
my
head
swearing
that
he
will
shoot
me
dead
if
he

not
my

instead
the

the
lash
of
wealth
and
out
my
heart
and
flings
the

pittance
of
his
shakes
his
serpent
tongue
that
lies
wins
trust
for
poisoned
sophistries

me
in
the
dark

you

stood
unflinching
pure

true
to
annihilate
that
hateful

green

beat
out
of

had
you
lived
when
a

scoundrels
of

outdone
trod
down
the
toilers
birth
derides
with
cromwell
and
his

the

had
discovered
you
where
naseby
saw
the

run
and
yet
you
same
knight
in
list
for
freedom
in
her
narrow
dawn
against
that
one
against
those
few
vile
king
vile
yet
you
stand
by
the
bloody
capitalist
fight
with
the
pandar
gentleman
in
trafalgar
square
the
stars
shone
faint
through
the
smoky
blue
the
were
ringing
three
girls
arms
laced
were
passing
through
tramping
and
singing
their
heads
were
bare
their
short
skirts
swung
as
they
went
along
their
breasts
heaved
up
as
they
sung
their
defiant
song
it
was
not
too
clean
their
feminine
lay
but
it
thrilled
me
quite
with
its
challenge
to
villainous
day
and
infamous
night
with
its
threat
to
the
robber
rich
the
proud
the
respectable
free
and
i
laughed
and
shouted
to
them
aloud
and
they
shouted
to
me
the
shout
we
shall
with
rifles
and
the
old
red
flag
the
a
street
fight
to
mr
f
sir
we
approve
your
curling
lip
and
nose
at
this
vile
sight
these
men
these
women
are
brute
beasts
knows
sir
but
that
you
are
right
panders
and
harlots
rogues
and
thieves
and
worse
we
are
a
crew
whose
pitiful
honoured
in
the
purse
of
gentlemen
like
you
whom
holy
taught
like
us
thine
is
mine
we
must
love
you
who
have
made
us
may
perhaps
in
an
east
end
hovel
to
a
workman
a
suicide
man
of
despair
and
death
bought
and
slaved
in
the
gangs
starved
and
stripped
and
left
to
the
pitiful
pitiless
night
away
with
your
selfish
thoughts
touch
not
your
ignorant
life
are
there
no
masters
of
slaves
jeering
cynical
are
there
no
brigands
say
with
the
words
of
christ
on
their
lips
and
the
daggers
under
their
is
there
not
one
of
these
that
you
can
steal
on
and
kill
o
as
the
swiss
mountaineer
dogged
on
the
perilous
heights
his
disciplined
conqueror
foes
caught
up
one
in
his
arms
and
laughing
exultantly
plunged
with
him
to
the
abyss
so
let
it
be
with
you
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
and
a
life
for
a
life
tell
it
this
hateful
strong
contemptuous
hypocrite
world
tell
it
that
if
we
must
live
as
dogs
and
as
worse
than
dogs
at
least
we
can
die
like
men
tell
it
there
is
a
woe
not
for
the
conquered
alone
eye
for
an
a
a
a
life
for
a
dublin
at
dawn
in
the
chill
grey
summer
we
pass
through
the
empty
streets
the
rattling
wheels
are
all
silent
no

at
the
corners
a
man
in

a
bayonet
hangs
by
his
side
and
a
rifle
is
in
his

this
is
a
conquered
city
it
speaks
of
war
not
peace
and
one
of
the
english
soldiers
the
english
call
you
see
at
the
present
moment
that
noble
country
of
mine
is
boiling
with
indignation
at
the
memory
of
a
in
a
path
in
the
phœnix
park
where
the
children
romped
and
ran
an
irish
ruffian
met
his
doom
and
an
english
gentleman
for
a
hundred
and
over
a
hundred
years
on
the
country
side
men
and
women
and
children
have
slaved
and
starved
and
died
that
those
who
slaved
and
starved
them
might
spend
their
earnings
then
and
the
irish
ruffians
have
a
time
and
the
english
gentlemen
and
why
at
the
present
moment
that
noble
country
of
mine
is
boiling
with
indignation
at
the
memory
of
a
for
the
irish
ruffians
they
tell
me
and
it
looks
as
if
true
and
the
english
gentlemen
are
so
scarce
we
could
not
spare
those
two
in
the
chill
grey
summer
we
pass
through
the
empty
streets
the
rattling
wheels
are
all
silent
no

one
of
the
english
soldiers
the
english
call
the
caged
i
went
the
other
day
to
see
the
birds
and
beasts
they
keep
enmewed
in
the
london
zoo
one
of
the
first
i
one
of
the
first
i
noticed
was
an
eagle
ragged
befouled
within
his
iron
bars
he
sat
without
a
movement
or
a
sound
and
when
i
stood
and
pitying
looked
at
him
i
saw
his
great
sad
eyes
that
winkless
gazed
out
to
the
horizon
sky
i
passed
from
there
and
walked
about
the
gardens
hither
and
thither
till
all
the
afternoon
was
spent
returning
then
to
seek
my
home
again
by
chance
i
passed
the
cage
and
stood
again
and
looked
and
saw
his
great
sad
eyes
that
winkless
gazed
out
to
the
horizon
sky
so
i
went
home

have
loved
you
through

and
rain
and
pitiless

at

and
his

sat
in
the
car
revolvers
in
their
laps
from
either
side
the
wintry
road
there
flashed
thin
in
the
rainy
dusk
the
father
swayed
and
fell
shot
through
the
chest
the
son
was
up
but
one
more
leaped
close
from
the
of
a
bush
not
five
yards
from
him
and
lit
all
the
face
of
him
whose
sweetheart
walked
the
dublin
streets
for
lust
of
him
who
gave
one
yell
and
fell
flat
on
the
stony
road
a
sweltering
corse
then
they
came
out
the
men
who
did
this
thing
and
looked
upon
their
retribution
while
heedlessly
the
rattling
car
fled
on
old
wolf

letch
for

for

with

laughed
aloud
the
great
sob
in
my
throat
o

no

in

hopeless
wanderer
that

not

must
believe
in
you

o
sister
who
made
holy
with
your
kiss
your
kiss
in
that
wet
dark
mild
night
of
march
there
in
the
hideous
infamous
london
streets
my
cheek

my
soul
a

o

o
my

lost
sheep
the
new
locksley
hall
years
comrade
yet
a
little
further
i
would
go
before
the
night
closes
round
and
chills
in
darkness
all
the
glorious
sunset
yet
a
little
by
the
cliff
there
till
the
stately
home
i
see
of
the
man
who
once
was
with
us
comrade
once
with
you
and
me
nay
but
leave
me
pass
alone
there
stay
awhile
and
gaze
again
on
the
waters
and
the
dreamy
southern
main
for
the
evening
breeze
is
sighing
in
the
quiet
of
the
hills
moving
down
in
cliff
and
terrace
to
the
singing
sweet
while
the
river
the
copse
and
the
lea
winds
her
waveless
way
eternal
to
the
welcome
of
the
sea
yes
within
that
homestead
gardened
grounds
and
velvet
ease
of
a
home
where
culture
reigneth
and
the
chambers
whisper
peace
is
the
man
the
seer
and
singer
who
ah
years
and
years
away
lifted
up
a
face
of
gladness
at
the
breaking
of
the
day
for
the
desperate
ardours
that
had
seen
the
roman
town
wrap
the
boy
keats
the
hungry
generations
trodden
down
in
his
with
the
ashes
of
the
fairy
child
of
storm
fluttering
skylark
in
the
breakers
caught
and
smothered
by
the
foam
and
had
closed
those
eyes
heroic
weary
for
the
final
peace
byron
maimed
and
maddened
strangled
in
the
anguish
that
was
for
this
noontide
passed
to
darkness
brooding
doubt
and
wild
dismay
where
the
silly
sparrows
chirruped
and
the
eagles
swooped
away
till
once
more
the
trampled
peoples
and
the
murdered
soul
of
man
raised
a
haggard
face
where
the
day
began
where
the
sign
of
renewal
and
and
outgrew
in
the
golden
sun
arising
and
we
hailed
it
we
and
you
o
you
hailed
it
and
your
heart
beat
and
your
pretty
lays
in
the
fathomless
vibration
of
our
rapturous
amaze
died
for
ever
on
your
harpstrings
and
you
rose
and
struck
a
chord
high
full
clear
heroic
godlike
the
glory
of
the
lord
noble
words
you
spoke
we
listened
and
we
dreamed
the
day
had
come
when
the
faith
of
god
and
christ
should
sound
one
cry
with
when
the
men
who
stood
beside
us
eager
with
troops
to
cope
radiant
thrilled
exultant
proud
with
the
magnificence
of
hope
forward
ran
our
forward
by
our
side
you
gave
back
the
glorious
summons
would
that
day
that
you
had
died
better
lying
fallen
breathless
bleeding
on
your
face
with
your
bright
sword
pointing
onward
dying
happy
in
your
place
better
to
have
passed
in
spirit
from
the
eclipse
with
the
great
cause
in
your
heart
and
with
the
on
your
lips
better
to
have
fallen
charging
having
known
the
nobler
time
in
the
fiery
cheer
and
impulse
of
our
serried
than
to
stand
and
watch
your
comrades
in
the
hail
of
fire
and
lead
up
the
slopes
and
the
the
dying
and
the
dead
till
the
sun
strikes
through
a
moment
to
our
one
victorious
shout
on
our
bayonets
bristling
brightly
as
we
carry
the
redoubt
o
pusillanimous
faltering
heart
and
fuddled
brain
that
remembered
and
turned
back
and
dreamed
left
the
plain
of
blood
and
battle
for
the
quiet
of
the
hills
and
the
sunny
soft
contentment
that
the
woody
homestead
fills
there
you
sat
and
sang
of
egypt
of
its
sober
solid
graves
pyramids
you
call
them
sphinxes
mortared
with
the
blood
of
slaves
houses
streets
and
stately
palaces
the
mart
the
regal
stew
where
freedom
so
slow
it
stops
with
lords
and
you
o
you
mocked
at
our
confusion
o
you
told
us
of
our
crimes
us
ungentle
not
like
warriors
of
the
sweet
idyllic
times
flowers
of
kings
and
courts
where
pretty
poet
knights
tilted
gaily
or
slew
peasants
hundreds
in
the
fights
o
you
drew
the
hideous
picture
of
our
bravest
and
our
best
patient
martyrs
desperate
swordsmen
for
the
cause
that
gives
not
men
of
science
the
of
writers
essayists
and
poets
prophets
priests
coward
you
have
made
the
great
refusal
you
have
won
the
gilded
praise
of
the
wringers
of
his
from
the
sunless
days
of
the
lord
and
the
of
the
rich
man
who
has
bound
labour
on
the
wheel
to
break
him
strew
his
rent
limbs
on
the
ground
with
a
vulture
eye
aglare
on
brothers
sisters
that
he
had
crying
and
guns
to
shoot
them
if
the
hunger
drive
them
mad
coward
faithless
unbelieving
that
had
courage
but
to
take
what
of
pleasure
and
of
beauty
men
have
won
for
sake
blustering
long
and
loudest
at
the
hideousness
and
pain
these
you
praise
have
brought
upon
us
blustering
long
and
loud
again
at
our
agony
and
anguish
in
this
desperate
fight
of
ours
grappling
with
anarch
custom
and
the
darkness
and
the
powers
o
begone
then
from
among
us
echo
not
however
faint
our
great
our
great
sweet
and
sickly
sit
there
dreaming
in
your
gardens
looking
out
upon
the
sea
till
the
closes
round
you
and
the
wind
is
on
the
lea
enter
then
within
your
chambers
in
the
rich
and
quiet
light
never
think
of
us
who
struggle
in
the
tempest
and
the
night
soothe
your
fancy
with
your
visions
bend
a
gracious
senile
ear
to
the
praise
your
guests
are
murmuring
in
the
tone
you
love
to
hear
honoured
of
your
queen
and
honoured
of
the
gentlest
and
the
best
lord
and
commoner
and
smirking
tenant
shopman
priest
all
distinguished
and
respectable
the
shiny
sons
of
light
o
what
o
what
are
these
who
call
you
coward
in
the
night
ay
what
are
we
who
struggled
for
the
cause
of
science
say
darwin
huxley
spencer
häckel
marshalling
our
stern
array
we
who
raised
the
cry
for
culture
spirit
leading
on
marching
gladly
with
our
captains
renan
arnold
emerson
we
we
are
not
tinkers
tinkers
of
the
kettle
cracked
and
broke
tailors
squatted
patching
at
the
greasy
cloak
we
are
those
that
faced
mad
fortune
cried
truth
and
only
she
onward
upward
if
we
perish
we
at
least
will
perish
free
we
have
lost
our
souls
to
win
them
in
the
house
and
in
the
street
falling
stabbed
and
poisoned
making
a
victory
of
defeat
we
have
lost
the
happy
present
we
have
paid
heavy
debt
we
have
won
have
won
the
future
and
its
sons
shall
not
forget
enter
then
within
your
chamber
in
the
rich
and
quiet
light
never
think
of
us
who
struggle
in
the
tempest
and
the
night
spread
your
nostrils
to
the
incense
hearken
to
the
murmured
hymn
of
the
praising
people
rising
from
the
temple
fair
and
dim
ah
but
we
here
in
the
tempest
we
here
struggling
in
the
night
see
the
worshippers
see
the
temple
emptying
quite
see
the
godhead
turning
ghostlike
see
the
pride
of
name
and
fame
paling
slowly
sad
and
sickly
with
forgetfulness
and
shame
darker
darker
grows
the
night
now
louder
louder
cries
the
wind
i
can
hear
the
dash
of
breakers
and
the
deep
sea
moves
behind
i
can
see
the
ghostlike
phalanx
rushing
on
the
crumbling
shore
slowly
but
surely
shattering
its
rampart
evermore
and
my
voice
is
calling
and
his
solitary
cry
on
the
great
dark
swift
like
summons
sweepeth
by
farewell
then
whom
once
i
loved
so
whom
a
boy
i
thrilled
to
hear
urging
courage
and
reliance
loathing
acquiescent
fear
i
must
leave
you
i
must
wander
to
a
strange
and
distant
land
facing
all
that
fate
shall
give
me
with
her
hard
unequal
i
once
more
anew
must
face
them
toil
and
trouble
and
disease
but
these
a
man
may
face
and
conquer
for
there
waits
him
death
and
peace
and
the
freedom
from
dishonour
and
denial
confessed
of
what
he
knows
is
truest
what
most
beautiful
and
best
o
farewell
then
i
must
leave
you
you
have
chosen
you
are
right
you
have
made
the
great
refusal
you
have
shunned
the
wind
and
night
you
have
won
your
soul
and
won
not
lost
it
as
they
happy
blest
of
gods
and
monarchs
o
a
long
a
long
farewell
of
farewell
to
the
market
and
two
little
darlings
alone
clinging
hand
in
hand
two
little
girls
come
out
to
see
the
wonderful
land
here
round
the
flaring
stalls
they
stand
in
the
throng
while
the
great
the
eloquent
huckster
perorates
loud
and
long
they
watch
those
mortals
the
dirty
guzzling
boys
who
partake
of
dates
periwinkles
ices
and
other
joys
and
their
little
mouths
go
wide
open
at
some
of
the
brilliant
sights
that
little
darlings
may
see
in
the
road
of
edgware
on
saturday
nights
the
name
is
susannah
she
was
four
years
old
last
may
and
the
youngest
is
just
three
years
old
and
i
know
all
about
their
cat
and
their
father
and
mother
too
and
their
only
brother
who
got
his
head
jammed
in
the
flue
and
know
several
particulars
of
a
similar
sort
of
me
for
we
went
up
and
down
together
for
over
an
hour
we
three
and
susannah
walked
beside
me
as
became
the
wiser
and
older
fast
to
one
finger
but
sat
solemnly
up
on
my
shoulder
and
we
bought
some
sweets
and
a
monkey
that
climbed
up
a
stick
and
then
last
we
adjourned
for
refreshments
and
the
ladies
had
each
an
ice
and
ice
was
a
pink
one
and
she
sucked
it
up
so
quick
but
silently
proffered
her
ice
to
me
for
a
lick
and
then
we
went
home
to
mother
and
we
found
her
upon
the
floor
and
father
was
trying
to
balance
his
shoulders
against
the
door
and
susannah
said
and
sir
go
in
ourselves
sir
and
we
kissed
one
another
and
parted
and
they
stole
in
hand
in
hand
and
o
for
my
two
little
darlings
i
never
shall
see
again
though
i
stand
for
the
whole
night
watching
and
crying
here
in
the
rain
ii
and
in
the
pit
of
the
is
the
pit
the
ovens
like
dragons
of
fire
glare
their
eyes
with
restless
hungry
desire
from
the
tropic
night
rushes
the
funnelled
air
our
heads
expand
and
fall
in
our
hearts
thump
huge
as
despair
we
make
the
bright
hot
blood
of
this
throbbing
inanimate
thing
and
our
life
is
no
less
the
fuel
than
the
coal
we
shovel
and
fling
lest
of
this
we
be
proud
or
anything
but
meek
we
are
well
cursed
and
ten
shillings
a
week
in
its
shaft
turns
pitiless
lost
souls

hell

poor
men

at
the
sunset
hour

comes
washed
from

kneels
his
face
to
the
hallowed
west
he
prays
and
bows
and
prays
does
he
pray
for
death
and
rest
to
india
o
india
india
o
my
lovely
at
whose
sweet
throat
the
greedy
english
snake
with
fangs
and
lips
that
suck
and
never
slake
clings
while
around
thee
band
by
stifling
band
the
loathsome
shape
twists
chaining

o
from
this
must
thou
never
wake
from
limbs
enfranchised
these
foul
fetters
to
shake
and
proud
among
the
nations
to
rise
and
stand
nay
but
thine
eyes
thine
eyes
wherein
there
stays

patience
of
that
august
faith
that
scorns

echoed
back
aloud

bore
apart

torn

cruel
deeds

sown
alternative
we
hate
you
we
your
sons
who
yet
believe
that
truth
and
justice
are
not
empty
creeds
no
but
because
of
greed
and
golden

love
is
my
lyrics
i
at
anchor
in
that
harbour
of
the
island
the
chinese
gate
we
lay
where
terraced
under
highland
the
sate
ships
steamers
sailors
many
a
flag
and
nation
a
motley
crew
junks
sampans
all
swarming
jubilation

watched
and
knew
then
as
i
stood
sweet
sudden
sounds
on
the
boon
breeze
the
chiming
echoes
rang
out
telling
of
inland
peace
o
english
chimes
your
music
rising
and
falling
i
can
not
praise
although
to
me
it
come
recalling
dear
childish
days
yet
english
chimes
links
of
chains
that
sever
worn
out
and
done
that
land
and
creed
that
i
have
left
for
ever
ring
on
ring
on
ii
there
is
much
in
this
city
i
have
not
met
with
before
but
one
or
two
things
i
notice
that
i
seem
to
have
known
of
yore
in
the
lovely
tropical
verdure
in
the
streets
behold
i
can
the
hideous
english
buildings
and
the
brutal
english
man
iii
i
stand
and
watch
the
soldiers
marching
up
and
down
above
the
fresh
green
just
outside
the
town
i
stand
and
watch
and
wonder
when
in
the
english
land
this
poor
fool
tommy
atkins
will
learn
and
understand
zulus
and
boers
and
arabs
all
fighting
to
be
free
men
and
women
and
children
murdered
and
maimed
has
he
in
india
and
in
ireland
held
the
people
down
while
the
robber
english
gentleman
took
pound
and
penny
and
crown
to
make
him
false
to
his
order
what
was
it
that
they
to
make
him
his
oppressor
the
clothes
and
pay
of
a
slave
o
thou
poor
fool
tommy
atkins
thou
wilt
be
wise
that
day
when
with
eager
eyes
and
clenched
teeth
thou
risest
up
to
say
is
our
free
i
every
rotten
iv
there
is
a
valley
green
that
lies
hills
the
bower
the
many
coloured
butterflies
flutter
from
flower
to
flower
and
round
one
lush
green
side
of
it
in
gardened
homes
are
laid
with
grief
and
care
compassionate
the
people
of
the
dead
there
all
the
voicing
summer
day
they
sing
the
happy
rills
no
noisy
sound
awakes
away
the
echo
of
the
hills
a
glimpse
of
china
i
in
a
sampan
up
in
the
misty
morning
up
past
the
gardened
hills
with
the
rhythmic
stroke
of
the
rowers
while
the
blue
deep
pales
and
thrills
past
the
green
where
the
winging
down
from
the
fleets
of
junks
and
sampans
and
the
ancient
chinese
town
ii
in
a
chair
from
the
bright
and
blinding
sunshine
from
the
whirling
song
into
the
dark
and
narrow
fissures
of
the
streets
i
am
borne
along
here
and
there
a
broadens
and
drops
on
the
brown
bare
crowd
the
crowd
of
the
open
shops
we
move
on
over
the
bridges
with
their
blocks
of
stone
and
their
quaint
grey
animal
figures
and
the
booths
the
hucksters
own
behind
a
linen
awning
sits
an
ancient
wight
and
a
little
dear
of
a
girl
is
head
on
a
bended
bamboo
shouldered
bearing
a
block
of
stone
two
coolies
utter
their
grunting
groan
children
beauties
impossibly
mangy
curs
take
part
in
the
motley
stream
of
insouciant
passengers
this
is
the
dream
the
vision
that
comes
to
me
and
vision
of
the
labyrinthine
iii
these
chinese
toil
and
yet
they
do
not
starve
and
they
obey
and
yet
they
are
not
slaves
it
is
the
fuddled
englishmen
that
grovel
rotting
in
their
living
graves
these
chinese
do
not
fawn
with
servile
lips
they
lift
up
equal
eyes
that
ask
and
scan
their
degradation
has
escaped
at
least
that
choicest
curse
of
gentleman
iv
over
the
samovar
i
used
always
to
think
that
you
russians
knew
how
to
make
the
good
drink
as
none
others
do
i
thought
moreover
not
with
the
epicures
you
might
search
the
world
over
for
such
women
as
yours
both
these
matters
now
i
perceive
i
was
right
and
i
really
tell
you
how
much
i
delight
my
third
thanks
another
cup
idea
of
the
fun
when
your
country
gets
up
and
follows
the
sun
just
as
in
europe
see
a
conqueror
nation
so
why
not
in
asia
be
a
like
jubilation
as
well
as
organized
the
eternal
coolie
from
being
robbed
and
despised
takes
to
cutting
throats
duly
be
flurried
for
i
daresay
by
then
be
comfortably
buried
ladies
and
gentlemen
more
thanks
i
must
be
going
so
glad
to
have
made
this
opportunity
of
knowing
some
more
russian
ladies
to
japan
simple
you
were
and
good
no
kindlier
heart
beat
than
the
heart
within
your
gentle
breast
labour
you
had
and
happiness
and
rest
and
were
the
maid
of
nations
now
you
start
to
feverish
life
feeling
the
poisonous
smart
upon
your
lips
of
harlot
lips
the
lips
of
her
who
stands
among
the
rest
with
greasy
righteous
soul
and
rotten
heart
o
sunrise
land
o
land
of
gentleness
what
madness
drives
you
to
dreadful
bed
o
thrice
accursèd
england
wretchedness
for
ever
be
on
you
of
whom
said
prostitute
that
you
catch
and
kiss
innocent
lives
to
make
them
foully
dead
dai
butsu
he
sits
upon
the
kingly
head
doth
rest
the
wimple
and
the
heavy
rings
touch
on
the
shoulders
where
the
shadow
clings
the
downward
garment
shows
the
ambiguous
breast
the
face
one
scarce
can
look
on
lest
one
learn
the
secret
of
unspeakable
things
but
the
dread
gaze
descends
with
shudderings
to
the
veiled
couched
knees
the
hands
and
thumbs
o
lidded
downcast
eyes
that
bear
the
weight
of
all
our
woes
and
terrible
increase
proud
nostrils
lips
than
these
with
what
a
soul
within
you
do
you
wait
disdain
and
pity
love
of
hate
passion
eternal
patience
pain
and
peace
i
go
in
this
dense
east
in
sunshine
or
shade
i
retch
at
the
villainous
feast
that
england
has
made
and
my
shame
can
not
understand
as
scorn
springs
elate
how
i
ever
loved
that
land
that
now
i
hate
the
fisherman
in
the
dark
waveless
sea
deep
blue
under
deep
blue
the
fisher
drifts
by
on
the
tide
in
his
small
canoe
above
him
the
hills
crown
the
dense
jungly
sweeps
the
groves
hedge
round
the
hut
where
the
sleeps
is
it
not
better
so
to
be
as
this
savage
is
than
to
live
the
life
of
hopeless
agonies
a
islander
aloll
in
the
warm
clear
water
on
her
back
with
languorous
limbs
she
lies
the
baby
upon
her
breasts
paddles
and
falls
and
swims
with
eyes
she
smiles
guarding
it
with
her
hands
and
the
sob
swells
up
in
my
in
my
heart
that
understands
the
english
hatefullest
land
on
mothers
are
starved
and
the
children
death
is
better
than
new
guinea
i
saw
them
as
they
were
born
erect
and
fearless
and
free
facing
the
sun
and
the
wind
of
the
hills
and
the
sea
i
saw
them
naked
superb
like
the
greeks
long
ago
with
shield
and
spear
and
arrow
ready
to
strike
and
throw
i
saw
them
as
they
were
made
by
the
christianizing
crows
blinking
stupid
clumsy
in
their
greasy
clothes
i
heard
their
gibbering
cant
and
they
sung
those
hymns
that
smell
of
poor
souls
besotted
degraded
with
the
fear
of
and
and
i
thought
if
jesus
could
see
them
he
who
loved
the
freedom
the
light
and
loathed
those
who
compassed
heaven
and
earth
for
one
proselyte
to
make
him
etcetera
etcetera
then
this
sight
as
on
me
or
you
would
act
on
him
like
an
emetic
and
have
to
go
off
and
spue
o
jesus
o
man
of
the
people
who
died
to
abolish
all
the
pharisee
rank
and
respectable
the
scribe
and
the
greedy
o
jesus
o
sacred
socialist
you
would
die
again
of
shame
if
you
were
alive
and
could
see
what
things
are
done
in
your
name
a
death
at
sea
i
dead
in
the
he
lies
wrapped
in
an
old
brown
sail
the
smiling
blue
sea
and
the
skies
know
not
sorrow
nor
wail
dragged
up
out
of
the
hold
dead
on
his
last
way
home
wizened
a
chinee
old
o
he
is
home
brother
i
stand
not
as
these
staring
upon
you
here
one
of
patient
toilers
at
peace
i
see
i
revere
ii
in
the
warm
cloudy
night
we
go
from
the
motionless
ship
our
lanterns
feebly
glow
our
oars
drop
and
drip
we
land
on
the
thin
pale
beach
the
coral
round
us
a
glade
of
driven
sand
we
reach
our
burial
found
us
there
we
dig
him
a
grave
jesting
we
know
not
his
name
what
heeds
he
who
is
resting
resting
would
i
were
the
same
come
away
it
is
over
and
done
peace
and
he
shall
not
sever
by
moonlight
nor
light
of
the
sun
for
ever
and
ever
iii
in
the
pure
driven
sand
no
one
will
know
in
the
coral
isle
by
the
land
where
the
blue
tides
come
and
go
thou
wert
poor
despised
dead
thou
canst
have
what
mightiest
monarchs
have
prized
an
eternal
grave
with
the
lovely
isles
with
the
lovely
deep
where
the
sing
and
the
sunlight
smiles
thou
liest
asleep
iii
south
the
outcasts
here
to
the
parks
they
come
the
scourings
of
the
town
like
weary
wounded
animals
seeking
where
to
lie
them
down
brothers
let
us
take
together
an
easeful
period
there
is
worse
than
to
be
as
we
cast
out
not
of
men
but
of
god
victoria
to
james
moorhouse
of
left
melbourne
for
the
bishopric
of
he
came
a
stranger
and
we
gave
him
welcome
more
as
loved
friend
than
honoured
guest
he
spoke
were
we
then
all
so
slack
to
listen
to
hail
him
as
our
wisest
noblest
best
did
he
leave
he
toiled
and
we
we
under
such
a
leader
forgot
all
other
creeds
but
that
he
taught
and
proud
of
our
clear
answer
to
his
summons
forgot
all
other
fights
but
that
he
fought
did
he
leave
he
wearied
too
great
he
said
the
burden
we
saw
it
and
we
cried
with
anxious
love
does
he
let
him
back
down
in
the
battle
is
not
the
place
at
rest
above
did
he
leave
he
left
us
for
a
sphere
of
labour
a
tinsel
seat
within
a
house
that
shakes
to
herd
with
priests
with
lords
and
liars
that
still
would
bind
a
chain
that
breaks
did
he
leave
farewell
then
are
there
any
to
reproach
you
in
all
this
facile
crowd
that
weeps
and
cheers
not
one
but
ah
you
yet
shall
listen
sadly
to
an
echo
falling
faint
through
the
dead
years
did
he
leave
in
the
man
of
the
yonder
the
band
is
playing
and
the
fine
young
people
walk
they
are
envying
each
other
and
talking
their
pretty
empty
talk
there
in
the
shade
on
the
outskirts
stretched
on
the
grass
i
see
a
man
with
a
slouch
hat
smoking
that
is
the
man
for
me
that
is
the
man
of
the
nation
he
works
and
much
endures
when
all
the
rest
is
rotten
he
rises
and
cuts
and
cures
the
soldier
of
the
crimea
fighting
to
honour
fools
the
grappler
and
strangler
of
lee
lord
of
the
terrible
tools
in
all
the
conquered
nations
that
have
won
their
own
at
last
and
in
all
that
yet
shall
win
it
and
the
world
by
him
goes
past
o
strong
sly
world
this
nameless
still
man
is
the
hand
of
god
that
shall
clutch
you
for
all
you
have
done
or
can
what
do
you
say
that
we
the
why
strain
at
the
gnat
name
who
swallow
the
camel
thing
your
pocket
craves
that
we
are
the
same
nay
worse
when
power
is
ours
and
we
are
harder
masters
still
more
keen
to
ring
her
last
from
misery
more
greedy
of
our
will
true
and
when
you
see
men
sneer
at
us
call
us
swine
we
must
love
you
who
have
made
us
may
perhaps
in
that
rich
archipelago
of
sea
with
fiery
hills
thick
woods
wherein
the
mias
browses
along
the
trees
and
men
leave
monuments
of
speech
too
large
for
us
there
are
strange
far
up
their
roots
spread
from
the
central
trunk
and
settle
down
deep
in
the
earth
seventy
feet
below
in
the
past
days
here
grew
another
tree
on
whose
high
fork
the
parasitic
seed
fell
and
sprang
up
and
finding
life
and
strength
in
the
disease
decrepitude
and
death
of
that
it
fed
on
utterly
consumed
it
and
stands
the
monument
of
crime
so
labour
with
his
parasites
the
two
great
swollen
robbers
land
and
capital
stands
to
the
gaze
of
men
but
as
a
heap
of
rotted
dust
whose
only
use
must
be
to
rich
the
roots
of
the
proud
stem
that
killed
it
australia
i
see
a
land
of
desperate
droughts
and
floods
i
see
a
land
where
need
keeps
spreading
round
and
all
but
giants
perish
in
the
stress
i
see
a
land
where
more
and
more
and
more
the
demons
earth
and
wealth
grow
bloat
and
strong
i
see
a
land
that
lies
a
helpless
prey
to
wealthy
cliques
and
gamblers
and
their
slaves
the
huckster
politicians
a
poor
land
that
less
and
less
can
make
her
law
yea
but
i
see
a
land
where
some
few
brave
raise
clear
eyes
to
the
struggle
that
must
come
reaching
firm
hands
to
draw
the
doubters
in
preaching
the
gospel
and
drill
and
drill
yea
but
i
see
a
land
where
best
of
all
the
hope
of
victory
burns
strong
and
bright
art
let
art
go
if
it
must
be
that
with
it
men
must
if
music
painting
poetry
spring
from
the
wasted
hearth
yes
let
art
go
till
once
again
through
fearless
heads
and
hands
the
toil
of
millions
and
the
pain
be
passed
from
out
the
lands
till
from
the
few
their
plunder
falls
to
those
toiled
and
earned
but
hopeless
intervals
from
those
robbed
and
spurned
yes
let
art
go
without
a
fear
like
autumn
flowers
we
burn
for
with
her
reawakening
year
be
sure
she
will
return
return
but
greater
nobler
yet
because
her
laurel
crown
with
dew
and
not
with
blood
is
wet
and
as
our
queen
sit
down
i
came
to
buy
a
book
it
was
a
shop
down
in
a
narrow
quiet
street
and
here
they
kept
i
knew
these
socialistic
books
i
entered
all
was
bare
but
clean
and
neat
the
shelves
were
ranged
with
unsold
wares
the
counter
held
a
few
sheets
and
papers
here
and
there
hung
prints
and
calendars
i
rapped
and
straight
a
young
girl
came
out
through
the
inner
door
she
had
a
clear
and
simple
face
i
saw
she
had
no
beauty
loveliness
nor
charm
but
as
your
eyes
met
those
grey
eyes
like
to
a
mountain
spring
so
pure
you
thought
be
a
clever
man
who
looked
and
lied
i
asked
her
for
the
we
spoke
a
her
words
were
as
her
face
was
as
her
eyes
yes
read
many
books
like
this
of
mine
also
some
poets
shelley
byron
too
and
tennyson
but
only
dreamed
thus
then
we
talked
until
by
chance
i
spoke
a
phrase
and
then
a
name
her
face
lit
up
o
it
was
beautiful
or
never
face
was
george
she
said
and
then
a
look
a
flush
a
smile
such
as
sprung
up
in
cheek
when
some
voice
uttered
jesus
made
her
angel
she
turned
and
pointed
up
the
counter
i
loosing
mine
eyes
from
that
ensainted
face
looked
also
a
print
a
common
print
the
head
and
shoulders
of
some
man
she
said
quite
in
a
whisper
darling
that
in
this
life
of
wrong
and
woe
the
lovely
within
you
brooded
and
wept
and
loved
and
hated
and
pitied
and
knew
not
what
its
helplessness
could
do
its
helplessness
its
sheer
that
then
those
eyes
should
fall
those
angel
eyes
on
one
brooded
wept
loved
hated
pitied
even
as
you
had
but
therefrom
had
sprung
a
hope
a
plan
a
scheme
to
right
this
wrong
and
make
this
woe
less
hateful
to
the
and
that
pure
soul
had
found
its
master
thus
to
listen
to
remember
watch
and
love
and
trust
the
dawn
that
rose
up
through
the
dark
o
this
was
good
for
me
to
see
as
for
some
weary
hopeless
longer
and
toiler
for
kingdom
of
to
stand
some
lifeless
twilight
hour
and
hear
there
in
the
house
of
lazarus
mary
who
said
thus
he
looked
he
spake
the
master
to
hear
her
rapturous
words
and
gaze
upon
her
heavenly
face
william
wallace
the
ballarat
statue
of
this
is
scotch
william
wallace
it
was
he
who
in
dark
hours
first
raised
his
face
to
see
who
watched
the
english
tyrant
nobles
spurn
with
iron
hoofs
the
scottish
free
who
armed
and
drilled
the
simple
footman
kern
yea
bade
in
blood
and
rout
the
proud
knight
learn
his
feudalism
was
dead
and
scotland
stand
dauntless
to
wait
the
day
of
bannockburn
o
wallace
peerless
lover
of
thy
land
we
need
thee
still
thy
moulding
brain
and
hand
for
us
thy
poor
again
proud
tyrants
spurn
the

a
yet
more
hateful

pure
blue
flag
of
heaven
with
your
silver
stars
not
beside
those
not
beside
the
token
the
foul
gave
pure
blue
flag
of
heaven
must
you
ever
wave
no
but
young
exultant
free
from
care
and
crime
the
soulless
selfish
england
of
this
later
time
no
but
faithful
noble
rising
from
her
grave
flag
of
light
and
liberty
for
ever
must
you
wave
to
an
old
friend
in
england
was
it
for
nothing
in
the
years
gone
by
o
my
love
o
my
friend
you
thrilled
me
with
your
noble
words
of
faith
hope
beyond
life
and
love
love
beyond
death
yet
now
i
shudder
and
yet
you
did
not
die
o
my
friend
o
my
love
was
it
for
nothing
in
the
dear
dead
years
o
my
love
o
my
friend
i
kissed
you
when
you
wrung
my
heart
from
me
and
gave
my
stubborn
hand
where
trust
might
be
yet
then
i
smiled
and
see
these
bitter
tears
o
my
friend
o
my
love
no
bitter
words
to
say
to
you
have
i
o
my
love
o
my
friend
that
faith
that
hope
that
love
was
mine
not
yours
and
yet
that
kiss
that
clasp
endures
endures
i
have
no
bitter
words
to
say
o
my
friend
o
my
love
at
the
union
seamen
and
the
one
rises
now
and
speaks
cause
is
all
the
we
then
share
with
these
whose
very
flesh
and
our
own
all
that
we
can
of
what
we
have
and
are
is
it
that
their
work
is
in
the
earth
down
in
its
depths
and
ours
is
on
the
sea
the
fight
they
fight
is
ours
their
worth
our
worth
their
loss
our
loss
we
help
them
they
are
we
help
them
and
when
our
hour
too
breaks
and
on
to
every
ship
that
ploughs
the
wave
we
put
our
hand
at
last
our
hand
that
takes
its
own
will
they
forget
the
help
we
gave
if
our
robber
lords
would
rob
us
still
with
the
foul
hoard
of
beasts
without
a
soul
they
may
find
leprous
hands
to
work
their
will
but
for
their
ships
where
will
they
find
the
coal
them
the
voices
cry
they
help
them
here
resolute
stern
menacing
hark
the
sound
look
the
simple
fearlessness
of
dark
faces
and
deep
voices
all
around
to
his
love
me
love
to
be
true
teach
me
love
to
love
teach
me
to
be
pure
like
you
it
will
be
more
than
enough
and
in
days
to
come
give
me
my
seraph
too
a
son
nobler
than
i
a
daughter
true
like
you
son
to
battle
the
wrong
to
seek
and
strive
for
the
right
a
beautiful
daughter

point
us
on
to
the
light
her
poem
baby
girl
that
was
born
and
died
on
the
same
with
torn
heart
i
see
them
still
wee
unused
clothes
and
empty
cot
though
glad
my
love
has
missed
the
ill
that
falls
to
lot
tangled
paths
for
her
to
tread
throughout
the
coming
changeful
years
no
desperate
weird
to
dree
and
dread
no
bitter
lonely
tears
piercing
crown
of
thorns
will
press
my
aching
brow
no
starless
nights
no
sunless
morns
will
ever
greet
her
now
clothes
that
i
had
wrought
with
care
through
weary
hours
for
sweet
sake
are
laid
aside
and
with
them
there
a
heart
that
seemed
to
to
henry
george
in
america
not
for
the
thought
that
burns
on
keen
and
clear
heat
that
the
heat
has
turned
from
red
to
white
the
passion
of
the
lone
remembering
night
one
with
the
patience
day
must
see
and
not
for
the
shafts
the
lying
foemen
fear
shot
from
the
intense
but
for
the
heart
of
love
divine

praise
you

you
on

your
perfect

wherefore

for

fruit
what
writhes
and
dies
not
in
its
rotten
root
two
things
made
flesh
the
visible
desire
to
match
in
filth
the
skunk
the
ape
in
ire
mouthing
before
the
mirrors
with
wild
foot
beyond
all
feebler
footprint
of
pursuit
the
perfect
twanger
of
the
chinese
lyre
a
heart
with
generous
virtues
run
to
seed
in
vices
making
all
a
jumbled
creed
a
soul
that
knows
not
love
nor
trust
nor
shame
but
cuts
itself
with
knives
to
bawl
and
if
thou
known
of
late
art
still
the
same
what
need
o
soul
to
sign
thee
with
thy
name
once
on
thy
lips
the
bees
settling
made
sweet
the
heart
that
was
not
strong
and
sky
and
earth
and
sea
burst
into
song
once
on
thine
eyes
the
light
of
agonies
flashed
through
the
soul
and
robbed
the
days
of
ease
but
tunes
turn
stale
when
love
turns
babe
and
long
the
exiled
gentlemen
grow
fat
with
wrong
and
peasants
workmen
beggars
what
are
these
o
you
who
sang
the
italian
smoke
above
of
freedom
pipe
of
that
vile
band
whose
envy
slays
the
tyrant
not
the
love
of
these
poor
souls
none
have
the
keeping
it
is
your
is
your
pandar
hand
smites
the
bruised
mouth
of
pilloried
ireland
to
an
unionist
you
only
knew
how
gladly
given
it
all
these
the
light
of
mine
eyes
the
heat
of
my
lips
mine
agonies
my
yearning
tears
my
blood
that
drips
my
brain
that
sears
if
you

it
all
these
my
hope
and
my
youth
my
manhood
my
art
my
passion
my
truth
my

my
brother
you
would
not

what
have
you
to
do
with
me
you
would
not
would
not
turn
away
doubtingly
and
bitterly
you
only
knew
how
little
i
cared
for
these
other
the
delicate
speech
the
high
demand
of
each
from
each
the
imaginings
of
holy
land
if
you
only
knew
how
little
i
cared
for
these
other
the
wide
clear
view
over
peoples
and
times
the
search
in
the
new
entrancing
climes
wings
and
sweet
chimes
my
brother
if
you
only
knew
what
to
me
in
these
things
is
understood
as
it
seems
to
me
it
would
seem
to
you
what
was
good
for
the
cause
was
surely
good
my
brother
you
would
not
say
what
have
you
to
do
with
me
you
would
not
would
not
turn
away
doubtingly
and
bitterly
you
would
take
my
hand
with
your
hand
o
my
brother
if
you
only
knew
you
would
smile
at
me
you
would
understand
you
would
call
me
brother
as
i
call
you
to
my
friend
sydney
jephcott
with
a
copy
of
my
with
all
my
heart
friend
this
the
labour
of
my
past
though
the
heart
here
hidden
is
and
the
eternities
hold
the
present
fast
it
still
with
soul
and
heart
pledge
of
that
dear
day
when
the
shadows
stir
and
start
by
the
bright
sun
burst
to
zox
we
thank
you
for
a
noble
work
well
done
there
is
a
the
truer
one
the
better
part
the
simpler
heart
doth
know
the
care
to
give
the
day
a
brighter
sun
to
these
the
nameless
crowd
that
drags
on
slow
the
common
toil
the
common
weary
woe
the
world
cares
nought
for
but
work
secures
union
strength
and
that
grow
there
is
a
courage
that
unflawed
endures
the
sneer
the
slander
of
epicures
and
here
are
grateful
hearts
to
show
this
kindness
and
this
courage
both
are
yours
of
the
american
sons
of
the
song
we
knew
so
well
dear
father
when
we
answered
to
your
call
and
the
southern
moloch
stricken
shook
and
tottered
to
his
we
knew
so
well
you
loved
us
and
our
hearts
beat
back
to
yours
with
the
rapturous
adoration
that
through
all
the
years
endures
sisters

us
hasten
sweethearts

with
babe
at
breast
for
the
union
faith
and
freedom
for
our
hero
of
the
west
we
wrung
forth
victory
from
the
desperate
hands
of
crime
and
our
cause
blazed
out
beacon
through
the
endless
future
time
forgiven
forever
we
bade
it
cease
that
envy
hatred
strife
as
he
willed
our
murdered
father
that
had
sealed
his
love
with
life
dear

was
it
thus
then
did
we
this
but
in
a
dream

it
real
hideous
present

our
suffering
only
seem
and
listen
look
and
tell
us
are
these
joyless
toilers

more
wretched
patient
piteous
than
the

fought
to

weak
worn

yet
can
tell
how
they
kissed

clasped

victorious

peerless
pure
serene
and
glorious
wield
the
sceptre
of
the
world
a
fool
he
asked
me
of
my
clever
various
pen
that
might
some
day
have
sent
our
greatest
all
this
all
this
i
yet
he
will
not
stay
printer
all
his
i
said
that
a
workman
all
his
but
as
my
questioner
was
a
business
man
one
of
the
sons
of
capital
a
sage
whose
practicality
saw
i
can
suppose
quite
to
his
even
his
i
vouchsafed
explanation
young
man
my
friend
was
born
and
bred
a
workman
all
his
heart
and
soul
and
men
have
hearts
and
souls
other
than
those
the
doctor
proses
of
the
parson
prates
of
and
both
make
their
trade
were
centred
in
his
comradeship
and
love
his
friends
his
were
workmen
and
the
girl
he
wooed
and
made
a
happy
wife
and
mother
had
heart
and
soul
like
him
in
whence
she
sprung
observe
now
when
he
came
to
think
and
read
he
saw
it
seemed
to
him
he
saw
in
what
capitalists
employers
men
like
you
think
and
call
in
your
some
slight
mistakes
i
fancy
say
whereby
his
order
suffered
so
he
wonders
we
change
and
he
tries
and
tries
knowing
his
fellows
and
adapting
all
his
effort
in
the
channels
that
they
know
you
understand
an
unionist
now
for
the
second
point
this
man
believes
that
these
wrongs
pass
the
word
spring
from
a
certain
thing
called
which
you
and
i
know
is
a
thing
whereby
the
fittest
get
up
to
the
top
you
and
tread
down
all
the
others
well
this
man
sees
how
by
this
thing
he
has
the
chance
to
use
his
extra
wits
and
clamber
up
he
sees
how
others
like
me
my
father
was
a
and
i
trust
a
good
one
he
sees
moreover
how
perpetually
each
of
his
fellows
who
has
extra
wits
has
used
them
as
the
fox
fallen
in
the
well
used
the
confiding
goat
and
how
the
goats
more
and
more
wallow
there
and
stupefy
robbed
of
the
little
wit
the
hapless
crowd
had
in
their
general
haplessness
well
then
this
man
of
mine
this
is
against
all
law
human
divine
and
natural
i
admit
prefers
to
wallow
there
and
not
get
out
except
they
all
can
made
quite
a
tale
about
what
is
quite
simple
yet
curious
as
i
see
you
hold
now
frankly
tell
me
will
you
what
do
you
think
of
him
is
a
is
a
fool
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
but
i
am
told
that
it
was
some
such
fool
came
once
from
galilee
and
ended
on
a
cross
outside
jerusalem
and
that
this
fool
he
and
his
cross
broke
up
an
empire
that
seemed
adamant
and
made
a
new
world
which
renewed
again
is
europe
still
he
is
a
fool
and
it
was
some
such
fool
drudged
up
and
down
the
earth
these
later
years
and
wrote
a
book
the
other
fools
bought
up
in
tens
of
thousands
calling
it
a
gospel
and
this
fool
too
and
the
fools
that
follow
him
or
hold
with
him
why
he
and
they
shall
all
end
in
the
or
the
gutter
where
chew
the
husk
of
their
mad
dreams
and
die
for
what
are
their
follies
but
dreams
they
have
nothing
and
never
will
one
moment
i
have
just
a
word
to
say
how
comes
it
tell
me
friend
six
weeks
ago
a
was
sent
for
a
cause
his
fellows
thought
unjust
and
that
same
night
or
rather
the
next
morning
in
comes
one
to
tell
you
quite
politely
that
unless
that
was
setting
at
his
frame
they
feared
one
of
our
greatest
newspapers
would
not
go
that
day
a
harbinger
of
light
and
leading
to
gladden
and
instruct
its
thousands
and
if
i
remember
right
it
so
did
he
that
wretched
set
at
his
frame
and
does
how
came
it
also
that
three
months
ago
your
brother
the
shipowner
a
man
out
of
his
ship
and
bade
him
go
to
hell
and
in
the
evening
up
came
two
or
three
discreetly
asking
him
to
state
the
cause
and
when
he
said
see
them
with
the
other
videlicet
in
hell
they
said
they
feared
unless
the
other
came
thence
if
he
was
there
and
was
upon
his
ship
morning
it
would
not
sail
it
did
not
sail
till
noon
and
he
sailed
with
it
but
this
is
all
beside
the
point
our
who
sweats
there
and
who
will
not
write
you
except
to
help
a
friend
fallen
ill
why
he
beyond
a
doubt
he
is
a
fool
i
australian
press
them
yes
hang
them
all
they
are
fiends
just
that
and
all
agreed
fiends
should
be
sent
to
a
place
hot
were
fiends
too
of
themselves
they
delighted
in
it
all
their
fault
their
own
fault
listen
a
minute
let
anyone
talk
about
that
sort
of
talk
excuse
us
is
just
damned
rot
and
i
are
what
made
if
dying
of
phthisis
because
my
father
passed
on
to
me
what
the
price
is
his
excesses
and
i
overworked
come
off
worse
just
so
but
with
these
young
fiends
quite
the
reverse
homes
were
happy
and
bright
all
in
australia
their
parents
were
good
kind
wise
no
breath
of
failure
be
breathed
on
their
education
their
surroundings
the
healthy
training
that
gives
youth
groundings
people
who
say
that
the
larrikins
come
from
that
the
australian
narrow
harsh
rule
of
base
mean
parents
whose
ideas
drive
all
of
good
and
of
fair
thence
our
prostitute
girls
come
from
just
the
same
why
these
idiots
know
nothing
of
facts
social
laws
them
then
hang
them
all
we
like
god
must
be
just
it
was
all
their
own
faults
not
dust
to
dust
ii
lads
and
you
for
wrongs
and
sins
whose
dead
past
greed
and
lust
did
never
wince
to
make
your
fathers
mothers
and
now
you
miserable
fiends
in
hell
must
expiate
since
the
more
guilty
we
the
strong
the
few
whose
triumph
thrusts
you
down
into
the
stew
fear
lest
our
victims
rise
and
rend
us
fear
this
problem
mad
we
will
not
listen
to
with
her
your
here
blind
deaf
dumb
beasts
the
hour
shall
yet
appear
when
men
when
justicers
you
shall
speak
and
all
men
tremble
as
they
hear
delegates
yes
it
we
are
not
afraid
to
face
the
word
fit
for
what
said
the
tyranny
of
the
many
that
will
not
allow
the
right
to
any
to
seek
wealth
and
power
now
the
expense
of
the
many
say
that
one
or
this
works
then
he
drives
us
all
to
the
abyss
struggling
together
one
rises
again
while
the
rest
all
together
are
stifled
and
slain
this
of
brothers
comes
the
tyranny
of
one
sort
but
we
others
prefer
our
from
a
verandah
o
city
lapped
in
sun
and
sabbath
rest
with
happy
face
of
plenteous
ease
possessed
have
you
no
doubts
that
whisper
dreams
that
moan
disquietude
to
stir
your
slumbering
breast
think
you
the
sins
of
other
climes
are
gone
the
curse
rings
in
your
groan
of
men
the
stabbed
and
plundered
slaves
of
greed
these
are
your
own
you
shall
sweep
the
fiery
hell
that
craves
for
quenchment
the
bright
blood
of
human
waves
for
you
if
you
repent
not
shall
atone
for
dark
with
swarming
graves
a
memory
little
elfin
maid
old
though
scarce
two
years
with
your
big
dark
hazel
eyes
tenderer
than
tears
and
your
rosebud
mouth
lisping
jocund
things
breaking
brooding
silence
with
wistful
questionings
like
a
flower
you
grew
while
bright
sun
shone
does
the
greedy
spendthrift
earth
heed
a
flower
is
gone
no
but
fond
ken
that
gropes
through
strange
ways
almost
seems
to
hear
your
voice
seems
to
see
your
face
and
the
queensland
elections
cry
australia
listened
through
the
brawling
game
of
rascals
gambling
for
her
gold
the
traitors
who
had
sold
for
flimsy
english
gauds
her
righteous
through
the
foul
hubbub
it
did
seem
there
came
the
still
small
voice
of
nobler
things
untold
but
now
but
now
with
wonder
manifold
she
hears
a
voice
that
calls
her
by
her
name
australia
listens
as
the
mother
wilt
to
hear
her
cry
is
it
death
or
life
and
all
hope
made
audible
that
thrills
my
heart
and
gives
my
spirit
faith
from
out
the
gathering
leaps
forth
shrill
the
double
cry
the
dawn

breaking
northward

o

us
light

brutish
brainlessness
to
know
those
who
pulled
down
a
lion
can
shoot
a
dog
a
story
the
irish
delegates
in
do
you
want
to
hear
a
story
with
a
nobler
praise
than
of
a
man
who
loved
the
right
like
heaven
and
loathed
the
wrong
like
hell
then
that
story
let
me
tell
you
once
again
though
it
as
well
you
know
as
splendid
story
of
the
man
they
call
parnell
by
the
wayside
of
the
nations
lashed
with
whips
and
execrations
helpless
hopeless
bleeding
dying
she
the
maiden
nation
lay
and
the
burthen
of
dishonour
weighed
so
grievously
upon
her
that
her
very
children
hid
their
eyes
and
crept
in
shame
away
and
there
as
she
was
lying
helpless
hopeless
bleeding
dying
all
her
foes
came
round
her
fleering
jeering
as
they
said
is
freedom
fought
and
won
for
she
is
dead
down
and
done
for
and
her
weeping
children
shuddered
as
they
crouched
and
whispered
then
suddenly
all
that
throng
before
him
parting
see
a
man
with
firm
step
breaking
through
that
central
knot
that
gives
and
as
by
some
dear
lost
sister
he
knelt
down
and
softly
kissed
her
and
he
raised
his
pale
proud
face
and
cried
is
not
dead
she
lives
she
lives
i
say
and
i
here
i
am
come
to
fight
and
die
here
for
the
love
my
heart
has
for
her
like
a
slow
consuming
fire
for
the
love
of
her
low
lying
for
the
hatred
deep
undying
of
the
robber
lords
who
struck
and
stabbed
and
trod
her
in
the
mire
then
upon
that
cry
bewildering
some
of
them
her
hapless
in
their
hearts
there
leaped
up
hope
like
light
when
night
gives
birth
to
day
and
as
mocks
and
threats
defied
him
one
by
one
they
came
beside
him
till
they
stood
a
band
of
heroes
sombre
desperate
at
bay
and
the
battle
that
they
fought
there
and
the
bitter
truth
they
taught
there
to
the
blinded
suffering
grievously
alway
all
the
wrong
and
rapine
past
hers
of
her
lords
and
her
task
masters
is
not
this
the
larger
hope
of
all
as
night
gives
birth
to
day
for
the
lords
and
liars
are
quaking
at
the
stern
awaking
from
their
slumber
of
the
ages
and
the
peoples
slowly
rise
and
with
hands
locked
tight
together
one
in
heart
and
soul
for
ever
watch
the
sun
of
light
and
liberty
leap
up
into
the
skies
the
story
the
story
with
a
nobler
praise
than
of
the
man
who
loved
the
right
like
heaven
and
loathed
the
wrong
like
hell
and
with
calm
proud
exultation
bade
her
stand
at
last
a
nation
ireland
ireland
that
is
one
name
with
the
name
of
charles
parnell
at
the
india
docks
a
memory
of
august
the
spectacle
of
the
life
of
the
london
dock
labourers
is
one
of
the
most
terrible
examples
of
the
logical
outcome
of
the
present
social
system
in
the
six
great
metropolitan
docks
over
men
are
employed
the
great
bulk
of
whom
are
married
and
have
families
by
the
elaborate
system
of
their
wages
have
been
driven
down
to
and
even
for
the
few
hours
they
are
employed
making
the
average
weekly
earnings
of
a
man
amount
to
and
even
shillings
a
week
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
lives
are
lost
or
ruined
every
year
by
the
perilous
nature
of
the
work
and
absolutely
without
compensation
yet
so
fierce
is
the
competition
that
men
are
not
unfrequently
maimed
or
even
killed
in
the
desperate
struggles
at
the
gates
for
the
tickets
of
employment
guaranteeing
a
which
often
does
not
amount
to
more
than
a
few
pence
the
streets
and
houses
inhabited
by
this
unfortunate
class
are
of
the
lowest
of
vice
disease
and
death
and
the
monopolistic
companies
are
thus
directly
able
to
profit
by
their
wholesale
demoralization
by
ruthlessly
crushing
out
through
the
contractors
all
efforts
at
organisation
on
the
part
of
the
men
to
see
these
immense
docks
the
home
of
that
more
immense
machine
british
commerce
crowded
with
huge
and
stately
ships
steamers
and
sailors
the
first
in
the
world
and
to
watch
with
intelligent
eyes
by
what
means
the
colossal
work
of
loading
and
unloading
them
is
carried
out
this
is
to
face
a
sacrificial
orgy
of
human
youth
manhood
womanhood
and
age
with
everything
that
makes
them
beautiful
and
ennobling
and
not
merely
a
misery
and
a
more
appalling
than
any
juggernaut
progress
or
the
human
holocausts
that
were
offered
up
to
moloch
i
stood
in
the
ghastly
gleaming
night
by
the
swollen
sullen
flow
of
the
dreadful
river
that
rolls
her
tides
through
the
city
of
wealth
and
woe
and
mine
eyes
were
heavy
with
sleepless
hours
and
dry
with
desperate
grief
and
my
brain
was
throbbing
and
aching
and
mine
anguish
had
no
relief
for
never
a
not
all
the
dreary
day
and
all
the
weary
night
forlorn
would
the
pitiless
pulses
stay
of
the
thundering
great
machinery
that
such
insistence
had
as
it
crushed
out
human
hearts
and
souls
that
it
slowly
drove
me
mad
and
there
in
the
dank
and
foetid
mist
as
i
silent
and
tearless
stood
and
the
exhalations
sweating
forth
their
muddy
blood
breathed
full
on
my
face
and
poisoned
me
like
the
slow
putrescent
drain
that
carries
away
from
the
shambles
the
refuse
of
flesh
and
there
rose
up
slowly
before
me
in
the
dome
of
the
light
a
vast
and
shadowy
substance
with
shafts
and
wheels
of
might
tremendous
ruthless
fatal
and
i
knew
the
visible
shape
of
that
thundering
great
machinery
from
which
there
was
no
escape
it
stood
there
high
in
the
heavens
fronting
the
face
of
god
and
the
spray
it
sprinkled
had
blasted
the
green
and
flowery
sod
all
round
where
through
stony
precincts
its
cyclopean
pillars
fell
to
its
adamantine
foundations
that
were
fixed
in
the
womb
of
hell
and
the
birds
that
wild
and
whirling
and
flew
to
its
glare
were
struck
by
the
flying
and
maimed
and
murdered
there
and
the
dust
that
swept
about
its
black
panoply
overhead
and
the
din
of
it
seemed
to
shatter
and
scatter
the
sheeted
dead
but
mine
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
people
that
sought
this
horrible
den
and
they
mounted
in
thronged
battalions
children
and
women
and
men
right
out
from
the
low
horizons
more
far
than
the
eye
could
see
from
the
north
and
the
south
and
the
east
and
the
west
they
came
some
silent
some
raving
some
sobbing
some
laughing
some
cursing
some
crying
some
alone
some
with
others
some
struggling
some
dragging
the
dead
and
the
dying
up
to
the
central
wheel
enormous
with
its
wild
devouring
breath
that
winnowed
the
livid
and
the
sickening
fume
of
death
then
suddenly
as
i
watched
it
all
a
keen
wind
blew
amain
and
the
air
grew
clearer
and
purer
and
i
could
see
it
how
under
the
central
wheel
a
black
stone
altar
stood
and
a
great
gold
idol
upon
it
was
gleaming
like
fiery
blood
and
there
in
front
of
the
altar
was
a
huge
round
lurid
pit
and
the
thronged
battalions
were
marching
to
the
yawning
mouth
of
it
in
the
clangour
of
the
machinery
and
the
devouring
breath
that
winnowed
the
livid
and
the
sickening
fume
of
death
and
once
again
as
i
gazed
there
and
the
keen
wind
still
blew
on
i
saw
the
shape
of
the
idol
like
a
king
turned
carrion
yet
crowned
and
more
terrific
thus
for
his
human
fleshly
loss
and
with
one
clenched
hand
he
brandished
a
lash
and
the
other
held
up
a
cross
and
all
around
the
altar
were
seated
joyous
and
free
in
garments
and
choice
a
goodly
company
eating
and
drinking
and
wantoning
like
gods
that
scorned
to
know
of
the
thundering
great
machinery
and
the
crowds
and
the
pit
below
ah
christ
the
sights
and
the
sounds
there
that
every
hour
befell
would
wring
the
heart
of
the
devils
spinning
ropes
of
sand
in
hell
but
not
the
insolent
revellers
in
their
old
lascivious
children
starving
consumed
alive
with
disease
boys
and
men
tortured
to
fiends
and
branded
with
shuddering
fire
girls
and
women
shrieking
caught
and
whored
and
trampled
to
death
in
the
mire
babyhood
youth
and
manhood
and
womanhood
that
might
have
been
kneaded
a
bloody
pulp
to
feed
the
murderous
machine
and
still
with
aching
eyeballs
i
stared
at
that
hateful
sight
at
the
long
dense
lines
of
the
people
and
the
shafts
and
wheels
of
might
when
slowly
slowly
emerging
i
saw
a
great
globe
rise
on
the
dim
horizon
and
it
swam
up
into
the
skies
but
whether
indeed
it
were
the
sun
or
the
moon
i
could
not
say
for
i
knew
not
now
in
my
watching
if
it
were
night
or
day
but
when
that
great
globe
steadied
above
the
central
wheel
the
thronged
battalions
wavered
and
paused
and
an
awful
silence
fell
then
i
know
not
how
but
so
it
was
in
a
moment
the
flash
of
an
a
murmur
ran
and
rose
to
a
voice
and
the
voice
to
a
terrible
cry
enough
it
has
had
enough
we
will
march
no
more
till
we
drop
in
the
furnace
pit
give
us
food
give
us
rest
though
the
accursed
machinery
stop
and
then
with
a
shout
of
angry
fear
the
revellers
sprang
to
their
feet
and
the
call
was
for
cannon
and
cavalry
for
rifle
and
bayonet
and
one
rose
up
a
leader
of
them
lifting
a
threatening
rod
and
the
machinery
he
yelled
might
as
well
stop
god
but
the
terrible
replied
this
indeed
must
be
it
is
you
should
be
cast
to
the
furnace
pit
to
feed
the
we
and
the
central
wheel
enormous
slowed
down
in
groaning
plight
and
all
the
ærial
movement
ceased
of
the
shafts
and
wheels
of
might
and
a
superhuman
clamour
leaped
madly
to
where
overhead
the
great
globe
swung
in
the
gathering
gloom
portentous
huge
but
my
brain
whirled
round
and
my
blinded
eyes
no
more
could
see
or
know
till
i
struggling
seemed
to
awake
at
last
by
the
swollen
sullen
flow
of
the
dreadful
river
that
rolls
her
tides
through
the
city
of
wealth

madam
you
have

with

unholy

addressed
to
a
woman
who
never
breathed
upon

daub
you

with
folly
i
will
praise
you
alone
for
your
actual
imminent
worth
madam
you
have
done
well
fifty
years
unforgotten
pass
since
we
saw
you
first
a
maiden
simple
and
pure
now
when
every
robber

we
are
quite
sure
never
once
as
a
foe
open
foe
to
the
popular
power
as
nobler
kings
and
queens
have
you
faced
us
fearless
and
bold
no
but
in
backstairs
fashion
in
the
stealthy
twilight
hour
you
have
struggled
and
struck
and
stabbed
you
have
bartered
and
bought
and
sold
melbourne
the
listless
liar
the
gentleman
disraeli
the
faithless
priest
of
a
cynical
faith
these
were
dear
to
your
heart
these
were
the
men
you
favoured
those
whom
the
people
loved
were
fooled
and
flouted
and
torn
never
in
one
true
cause
for
your
sake
and
the
sake
did
you
strike
one
honest
blow
did
you
speak
one
noble
word
no
but
you
took
your
place
for
the
sake
of
wrong
and
the
sake
ever
with
wealth
with
the
greasy
respectable
herd
not
as
some

you
swagger
with
force
against
us
to
satisfy
your
greed

you
hoarded
and
hid
what
your
loyal
people
gave
to
you
golden
sweat
of
their
toil
to
keep
you
a
queen
indeed
pure
at

such

as
this

little
lad
with
a
bright
brave
face

and
a
wistful
yearning
wonder
comes
stealing
over
me
for
once
i

a
darling

dreamed
what
he
should
do
and
surely

had
i
thought
just
such
a
face
as
you
and
i
i
dreamed
to
see
him

and
brave
and
strong

the
light

the
dark

wrong

the
poor

of

beyond
the
lampless
sleep

both
real
and
both
as
modern
as
yet
seems
permitted
to
the
old
caste
and
religion
he
achieved
an
influence
over
men
of
all
denominations
and
of
none
that
was
quite
phenomenal
and
might
have
been
used
for
a
national
object
as
great
as
good

work
of
his
diocese
however
proving
too
much
for
his
strength
he
announced
the
fact
and
declared
that
unless
his
bishopric
were
divided
he
would
be
compelled
to
resign
it
shortly
afterwards
he
accepted
the
bishopric
of
manchester
on
the
ground
that
larger
sphere
of
labour
had
been
offered
to
him

departure
