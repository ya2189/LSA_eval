not
so
much
i
evaded
capture
today
with
only
a
handful
of
dust
to
escape
that
old
sandman
death
certainly
those
maroon
berries
so
large
luscious
crowded
on
their
fat
stems
had
something
to
do
with
it
as
did
the
ground
fog
leaving
its
burrow
as
so
many
their
crowded
nests
and
there
might
be
something
to
the
fact
the
moonlight
sat
fat
confidant
in
the
night
sky
as
surely
as
my
head
rests
on
this
pillow
and
the
poem
invites
itself
into
my
lair
of
thoughts
much
as
nestlings
charge
the
entrance
to
the
runway
of
a
tree
i
walked
flat
out
in
an
instance
as
standing
urine
held
its
own
stench
and
the
grim
splash
within
the
pond
dead
center
in
the
wilderness
underscores
the
tone
of
this
warning
one
thought
encapsulates
wonder
though
suggestive
evil
hides
leaden
leaves
buried
in
lake
mud
down
the
corner
eaves
of
fire
hydrant
mind
when
you
pray
for
someone
an
angel
sits
on
their
shoulder
when
that
same
someone
hates
you
does
that
angel
die
of
grief
serendipity
is
a
flower
and
those
clouds
the
breeze
harbingers
of
forbidden
things
not
so
much
like
these
boulders
use
scissors
to
open
twilight
and
watch
this
fading
light
ebb
forth
like
a
bird
squeezed
thru
an
opening

these

such

interested
in
the

of
such

their

the

then
intuition
is
in
the
eaves

the
seeping
into

cupolas
of
all
other
nether
spaces
these
big
wide
entrances
are
ourselves
in
all
their

notwithstanding
the
winchester
mansions
or
vanderbilt

where
our
very
personalities
are
laid
bare
see
antics
give
rise
to

feed

where
the

of

resplendent
in
rich
pride
of
self
longing
to
manifest
in
lavish
architecture
so
redolent
of
wealth
yet
in
squabbling
their
servant
quarters
where
murderous
passions
bare
dingy
walls
and
where
stained
yellowing

is
harbinger
to
further

a
no

gets

decided
to
forgo

enveloped
the

let
out
long

and
the

rounded
out

this
ennobled
them
and
they
were
famously
resilient
and
in
turn
redolent
with
firmness
the
gladness
of
life
there
was
a

a

the
largeness
