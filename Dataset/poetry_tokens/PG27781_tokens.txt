preface
the
author
respectfully
submits
to
the
general
public
of
his
native
town
and
district
this
volume
of
poems
containing
some
of
the
chief
results
of
his
musings
for
the
past
thirty
years
he
hopes
that
the
volume
which
is
in
reality
the
production
of
a
will
in
many
ways
be
deemed
worthy
of
the
kind
and
courteous
approbation
of
his
numerous
patrons
and
friends
as
well
as
the
indulgence
of
literary
critics
in
launching
forth
the
work
the
author
begs
to
tender
to
his
patrons
and
the
public
generally
his
most
sincere
and
hearty
thanks
for
the
assistance
they
have
ever
rendered
him
so
as
to
enable
him
to
acquire
the
necessary
leisure
for
the
cultivation
of
his
muse
the
result
now
achieved
is
not
the
comprehensive
collection
of
the
efforts
of
the
author
but
it
may
he
taken
as
a
selection
and
a
representation
of
his
more
generally
interesting
productions
from
time
to
time
various
reasons
have
operated
in
the
time
of
the
publication
and
the
curtailment
of
this
volume
but
it
is
now
submitted
with
every
respect
to
the
public
for
their
perusal
many
of
his
poems
which
are
not
found
in
the
present
volume
the
author
trusts
will
be
deemed
worthy
of
being
treasured
in
the
scrap
books
of
his
friends
of
the
literary
merits
of
the
composition
it
would
ill
become
the
author
in
any
way
to
descant
upon
but
in
regard
to
these
he
leaves
himself
entirely
and
absolutely
in
the
hands
of
a
critical
and
he
hopes
an
indulgent
public
feeling
assured
that
he
may
trust
himself
in
the
hands
of
his
readers
no
formal
dedication
is
here
made
to
any
particular
patron
but
the
book
is
submitted
without
the
powerful
influence
of
any
conspicuous
name
or
the
commendation
of
any
literary
friend
and
like
johnson
of
old
failing
patrons
he
trusts
that
his
work
will
in
the
midst
of
his
numerous
competitors
locally
and
generally
be
thought
worthy
of
the
attention
of
the
various
classes
of
the
public

no

but
tinkle
up

harp
again
a
moment

beguile

bard

rude
and
rough
yet
he
is
ever
proud
to
do
the
mite
that
he
can
do
and
thus
proclaim
the
grand
old
man
of
oakworth
of
whom
we
all
are
proud
for
base
indeed

bard
that
ever

did
he
not
wish
his
neighbour
well
and
praise
his
sterling
worth
leave
state
affairs
and
office
to
those
of
younger
blood
but
i
am
with
the
patriot
the
noble
wise
and
the
grand
old
man
of
oakworth
the
wise
the
great
the
good
this
worthy
old
philanthropist
whom
all
his
neighbours
greet
who
has
a
smile
for
every
one
whom
he
may
chance
to
go
to
yon
pleasant
village
on
the
margin
of
the
moor
and
you
will
hear
his
praises
sung
by
all
the
aged
the
grand
old
man
of
oakworth
a
friend
unto
the
poor
long
may
he
live
and
happy
be
the
patriot
and
the
sire
and
may
some
other
harp
give
praise
whose
notes
will
sound
much
higher
his
thirst
for
knowledge
worth
and
his
heart
was
ever
this
worthy
old
philanthropist
beyond
his
eightieth
year
the
grand
old
man
of
oakworth
beyond
his
eightieth
year
thoughts
suggested
on
hearing
lecture
on
burns
though
murky
are
the
days
and
short
and
man
he
finds
but
little
sport
these
gloomy
days
to
cheer
him
yet
if
a
dobie
should
perchance
come
out
before
an
audience
worth
our
while
to
hear
him
right
pleased
was
i
dear
sir
to
hear
your
lecture
on
that
subject
dear
so
grand
and
superhuman
for
all
the
world
doth
pay
regard
to
bobbie
burns
the
scottish
bard
the
patriot
and
the
ploughman
your
words
indeed
were
passing
good
on
him
who
kenned
and
understood
the
kirk
and
all
its
ranting
who
the
up
indeed
to
show
the
their
canting
you
painted
him
sometimes
in
glee
while
other
times
in
to
gold
without
alliance
yet
after
all
he
kept
his
pace
and
looked
grim
fortune
in
the
face
and
set
him
at
defiance
but
alas
the
picture
was
it
true
of
parents
poor
and
so
furrowed
and
so
it
makes
our
very
hearts
to
burn
to
think
that
was
made
to
mourn
and
tell
the
sad
sad
story
you
brought
me
back
to
days
bygone
when
glad
its
banks
i
strolled
upon
the
river
doon
so
bonnie
the
roofless
kirk
and
yard
so
green
where
many
a
tombstone
may
be
seen
with
tam
and
souter
johnnie
and
when
ye
spake
of
yond
bright
star
that
lingers
in
the
lift
afar
where
burns
was
never
weary
of
gazing
on
the
sphere
where
dwells
his
angel
lassie
his
ain
sweet
highland
mary
but
here
my
muse
its
wings
may
lower
such
flights
are
far
beyond
its
power
so
i
will
stop
the
jingle
sir
i
am
much

gordon
was
honoured
and
worshipped
by
all
the
acknowledged
master
of

lass
newsholme
dean
having
spent
the
whole
of
the
afternoon
in
this
romantic
little
glen
indulging
in
pleasant
meditations
i
began
to
wend
my
way
down
the
craggy
pass
that
leads
to
the
bonny
little
hamlet
of
goose
eye
and
turning
round
to
take
a
last
glance
at
this
enchanting
its
running
whimpering
beheld
the
newsholme
she
was
engaged
in
driving
home
a
cochin
china
hen
and
her
chickens
instantaneously
i
was
seized
with
a
poetic
fit
and
gazing
upon
her
as
did
robert
tannyhill
upon
his
imaginary
beauty
flower
of
dumblane
i
struck
my
lyre
and
although
the
theme
of
my
song
turned
out
afterwards
to
be
a
respectable
old
woman
of
winters
yet
there
is
still
a
charm
in
my
newsholme
thy
kiss
is
sweet
thy
words
are
kind
thy
love
is
all
to
me
aw
in
a

if
all

they
be
as

then
as

when
yellow
lustre
shines
hangs
her
golden

voice
fra
every
bush
is
singing
sweet
and
clear
some

yet
no
happier
i
ween
than
this
old
wife
hens
aw
saw
newsholme
dean
the
broken
pitcher
the
happiest
moments
of
a
soldier
in
times
of
peace
are
when
sat
round
the
hearth
of
his
neat
little
barrack
room
along
with
his
comrades
spinning
yarns
and
telling
tales
sometimes
giving
the
history
of
some
famous
battle
or
engagement
in
which
he
took
a
prominent
part
other
times
he
will
relate
his
own
love
adventures
then
the
favourite
of
the
room
will
oblige
them
with
his
song
of
or
generally
being
the
favourites
with
them
there
is
the
fancy
tale
teller
who
amuses
all
but
in
all
cases
the
teller
of
a
tale
yarn
or
story
makes
himself
the
hero
of
it
and
especially
when
he
speaks
of
the
lass
he
left
behind
him
hence
this
adventure
with
the
by
the
there
was
a
bonny
lassie
once
sitting
by
a
but
what
this
bonny
lassie
thought
i
can
not
can
not
when
by
there
went
a
cavalier
well
known
as
willie
wright
just
in
full
marching
order
his
armour
shining
bright
maiden
lovely
maiden
why
sits
thou
by
the
spring
dost
thou
seek
a
lover
with
a
golden
wedding
ring
or
wherefore
dost
thou
gaze
on
me
with
eyes
so
bright
and
wide
or
wherefore
does
that
pitcher
lay
broken
by
thy
side
pitcher
it
is
broken
sir
and
this
the
reason
is
a
villian
came
behind
me
he
tried
to
steal
a
kiss
i
could
na
take
his
nonsense
so
a
word
i
spoke
but
hit
him
with
my
pitcher
and
thus
you
see
uncle
jock
mcneil
ye
ken
now
waits
for
me
to
come
he
canna
mak
his
crowdy
till
it
goes
home
i
canna
tak
him
watter
and
that
i
ken
full
weel
and
so
sure
to
catch
it
for
play
the
varry
maiden
lovely
maiden
i
pray
be
ruled
by
me
smile
with
thine
eyes
and
ruby
lips
and
give
me
kisses
three
and
suppose
my
helmet
is
a
pitcher
made
steel
and
carry
home
some
watter
to
thy
uncle
jock
she
silently
consented
for
she
her
bonny
ee
i
threw
mi
arms
around
her
and
gave
her
kisses
three
to
wrong
the
bonny
lassie
i
sware
be
a
sin
so
knelt
dahn
by
the
watter
to
dip
mi
helmet
in
out
spake
this
bonny
lassie
soldier
lad
forbear
i
wadna
spoil
thi
bonny
plume
that
decks
thi
raven
hair
come
buckle
up
thy
sword
again
put
on
thi
cap
steel
i
carena
for
my
pitcher
nor
my
uncle
jock
i
often
think
my
comrades
about
this
northern
queen
and
fancy
that
i
see
her
smile
though
mountains
lay
between
but
should
you
meet
her
uncle
jock
i
hope
never
tell
how
i
squared
the
broken
pitcher
with
the
lassie
at
the
well
ode
to
sir
titus
salt
go
string
once
more
old
harp
and
bring
it
here
to
me
for
i
must
sing
another
song
the
theme
of
which
shall
be
a
worthy
old
philanthropist
whose
soul
in
goodness
soars
and
one
whose
name
will
stand
as
firm
as
rocks
that
gird
our
shores
the
fine
old
bradford
gentleman
the
good
sir
titus
salt
heedless
of
others
some
there
are
who
all
their
days
employ
to
raise
themselves
no
matter
how
and
better
men
destroy
how
different
is
the
mind
of
him
whose
deeds
themselves
are
told
who
values
worth
more
nobly
far
than
all
the
heaps
of
gold
his
feast
and
revels
are
not
such
as
those
we
hear
and
see
no
princely
show
does
he
indulge
nor
feats
of
revelry
but
in
the
orphan
schools
they
are
or
in
the
cot
with
her
the
widow
and
the
orphan
of
the
shipwrecked
mariner
when
stricken
down
with
age
and
care
his
good
old
neighbours
grieved
or
loss
of
family
or
mate
or
all
on
earth
bereaved
go
see
them
in
their
houses
where
peace
their
days
may
end
and
learn
from
them
the
name
of
him
who
is
their
aged
friend
with
good
and
great
his
worth
shall
live
with
high
or
lowly
born
his
name
is
on
the
scroll
of
fame
sweet
as
the
songs
of
morn
while
tyranny
and
villany
is
surely
stamped
with
shame
a
nation
gives
her
patriot
a
fame
no
empty
titles
ever
could
his
principles
subdue
his
queen
and
country
too
he
loved
was
loyal
and
was
true
he
craved
no
boon
from
royalty
nor
wished
their
pomp
to
share
far
nobler
is
the
soul
of
him
the
founder
of
saltaire
thus
lives
this
sage
philanthropist
from
courtly
pomp
removed
but
not
secluded
from
his
friends
for
bond
he
loved
a
noble
reputation
too
crowns
all
his
latter
days
the
young
men
they
admire
him
and
the
aged
they
him
praise
long
life
to
thee
sir
titus
the
darling
of
our
town
around
thy
head
while
living
weave
a
laurel
crown
thy
monument
in
marble
may
suit
the
passer
by
but
a
monument
in
all
our
hearts
will
never
never
die
and
when
thy
days
are
over
and
we
miss
thee
on
our
isle
around
thy
tomb
for
ever
may
unfading
laurels
smile
then
may
the
sweetest
flowers
usher
in
the
spring
and
roses
in
the
gentle
gales
their
balmy
odours
fling
may
beams
shine
sweetly
upon
thy
hallowed
clay
and
yellow
autumn
thy
head
yield
many
a
placid
ray

to

that
did
befall
how
can
my
trembling
pen
find
power
to
tell
the
grief
i
experienced
in
bidding
farewell
can
i
forget
the
days
joyously
spent
that
flew
on
so
rapidly
sweet
with
content
can
i
then
quit
thee
whose
so
dear
home
of
my
boyish
days
without
one
tear
can
i
look
back
on
happy
days
gone
by
without
one
pleasant
thought
without
one
sigh
ah
no
though
never
more
these
eyes
may
dwell
on
thee
old
cottage
home
i
love
so
well
home
of
my
childhood
wherever
i
be
thou
art
the
nearest
and
dearest
to
me
can
i
forget
the
songs
sung
by
my
sire
like
some
prophetic
bard
tuning
the
lyre
sweet
were
the
notes
that
he
taught
to
the
young
psalms
for
the
sabbath
on
sabbath
were
sung
and
the
young
minstrels
enraptured
would
come
to
the
little
lone
cottage
i
once
called
my
home
can
i
forget
the
dear
landscape
around
where
in
my
boyish
days
i
could
be
found
stringing
my
roaming
the
wood
fancying
myself
to
be
bold
robin

would
my
mother

gone
waiting
for
shuttles
that

should
have
she
in
that
cottage
there
knitting
her
healds
and
i
her
young
forester
roaming
the
fields
but
the
shades
of
the
evening
gather
slowly
around
the
twilight
it
thickens
and
darkens
the
ground
sombre
mantle
is
spreading
the
plain
and
as
i
turn
round
to
look
on
thee
again
to
take
one
fond
look
one
last
fond
adieu
by
envious
hand
thou
art
snatched
from
my
view

where
doon
in

ripples
sweetly
through
the
wood
and
on
its
banks
not
long
ago
a
little
cottage
stood
there
in
all
her
splendour
on
a
january
morn
appeared
old
robert

born
her
mantle
large
of
greenish
hue
and
robe
of
tartan
shone
and
round
its
mystic
border
seen
was
luger
ayr
and
doon
a
holly
bough
was
twined
so
graceful
round
her
brow
she
was
the
darling
native
muse
of
scotia
then
as
now
so
grand
old
genius
on
this
january
morn
appeared
in
all
her
splendour
when
robert
burns
was
born
she
vowed
she
would
leave
him
till
he
sung
old
the
daisy
and
the
thorn
he
tuned
in
lovely
strains
and
sung
of
yellow
autumn
or
some
lovely
banks
and
braes
and
make
each
cottage
home
resound
with
his
sweet
tuneful
lays
and
sing
how
genius
on
a
january
morn
appeared
in
all
her
splendour
when
robert
burns
was
born
she
could
not
teach
him
painting
like
her
cunningham
at
home
nor
could
she
teach
him
sculpturing
like
angelo
of
rome
but
she
taught
him
how
to
wander
her
lovely
hills
among
and
sing
her
bonny
burns
and
glens
in
simple
rustic
song
this
old
genius
did
that
january
morn
vow
in
all
her
splendour
when
robert
burns
was
born
and
in
the
nights
of
winter
when
stormy
winds
do
roar
and
the
fierce
dashing
waves
are
heard
on
old
craggy
shore
the
young
and
old
encircled
around
the
cheerful
fire
will
talk
of
rob
the
ploughman
and
tune
the
scottish
lyre

sing

a

of

the
grandest
old
statesman
there
is
upon
earth
when
his
axe
is
well
sharpened
we
all
must
agree
he
can
level
a
nation
as
well
as
a
tree
he
can
trundle
such
words
from
his
tongue
as
fairly
bewilder
both
old
men
and
young
he
can
make
some
believe
black
which
is
white
and
others
believe
it
is
morn
when
night
he
has
tampered
with
kings
and
connived
with
the
czar
his
bulgarian
twaddle
once
caused
a
great
war
where
thousands
were
slain
but
what
did
he
heed
he
still
went
to
church
the
lessons
to
read
a
bumbailey
army
to
egypt
he
sent
in
search
of
some
money
which
long
had
been
spent
he
blew
up
the
forts
then
commended
his
men
and
ordered
them
back
to
old
england
again
in
the
far
distant
soudan
the
mahdi
arose
no
doubt
he
intended
to
crush
all
his
foes
but
gladstone
sent
gordon
who
was
afraid
then
left
him
to
perish
without
any
aid
i
said
poor
gordon
out
of
this
place
that
traitor
called
gladstone
shall
see
my
to
the
congo
go
if
i
am
not
slain
and
never
put
foot
in
old
england
when
the
sad
news
arrived
of
the
fall
of
khartoum
and
of
how
our
brave
gordon
had
met
his
sad
doom
gladstone
went
to
the
theatre
and
grinned
in
a
box
he
knew
that
old
england
was
then
on
the
rocks
he
allowed
the
dutch
boers
on
majuba
hill
our
brave
little
army
to
torture
and
kill
and
while
our
poor
fellows
did
welter
in
gore
he
gave
up
the
sword
to
the
treacherous
boer
brave
though
black
cetewayo
the
great
zulu
king
to
civilised
england
they
captive
did
bring
he
sent
back
the
zulu
where
first
he
drew
breath
unguarded
and
helpless
to
meet
his
own
death
i
done
says
bismark
much
in
my
life
as
gladstone
has
done
in
fomenting
sad
strife
i
could
not
at
this
day
have
looked
in
the
face
of
king
prince
or
peasant
of
my
noble
he
has
tampered
and
tarnished
his
national
fame
he
has
injured
great
britain
in
interest
and
caused
strife
war
and
bloodshed
too
reckless
i
ween
not
caring
for
honour
of
england
or
queen
he
invokes
the
great
gods
their
rich
blessing
to
shower
as
he
stumps
our
great
nation
to
get
into
power
now
from
old
ireland
he
cravenly
begs
that

will

so
great
and

like
an
oak
in

fair
and
foul
weather
till

father
time
hath
forgotten
thy
date
a
pleasure
to
view
thee
from
or
level
from
moorland
from
meadow
or
mountain
afar
where
roman
more
safely
could
travel
in
days
when
the
briton
and
boman
waged
war
in
those
days
of
yore
from
hawkcliffe
to
rivoc
the
wolf
and
the
wild
boar
sought
after
their
prey
but
brave
sons
amongst
them
made
havoc
and
thus
for
cliffe
castle
they
opened
the
way
where
erst
were
wild
woods
crags
moorlands
and
marshes
in
days
long
gone
by
and
whose
dates
are
unknown
is
now
the
highway
where
stand
thy
proud
arches
oh
bonnie
cliffe
castle
thou
pride
of
the
town
true
that
thy
walls
were
not
built
for
defence
nor
that
thy
equipments
befit
thee
for
war
a
castle
of
love
is
thy
only
pretence
a
name
that
is
higher
and
nobler
by
far
thou
me
of
five
as
brothers
as
ever
set
sail
on
the
deep
breast
whose
lives
have
been
spent
in
love
toward
others
and
while
blessing
others
themselves
have
been
blest
like
heroes
of
old
on
horse
or
on
vessel
on
land
or
on
water
they
fought
and
they
won

oh
well

we
for
the

it
was
so
when
his
grace
the
duke
of
devonshire
made
our
famous
town
a
present
of
a
pretty
little
an
arcadia
in
its
and
how
the
bells
rang
merrily
on
that
eventful
day
oh
this
lovely
little
garden
be
to
us
a
pleasure
it
will
delight
the
great
to
them
be
a
treasure
and
who
are
they
who
dare
to
say
the
town
it
did
not
need
a
pretty
little
lovely
spot
and
a
happy
little
eden
in
this
pretty
little
paradise
of
beauty
and
of
search
our
land
from
end
to
end
you
could
not
find
a
grander
the
turtledove
can
make
its
love
not
caring
for
the
pigeon
if
he
belongs
his
politics
and
follows
his
religion
in
this
pretty
little
garden
when
the
bloom
is
on
the
heather
two
minds
with
but
one
single
thought
can
tell
their
tales
together
the
maiden
from
the
mansion
and
the
lady
from
the
villa
can
wander
there
and
shed
a
tear
beneath
the
weeping
willow
this
bonny
little
garden
is
fine
for
perambulators
where
our
handsome
can
wheel
our
lovely
creatures
and
oh
how
happy
they
will
be
as
time
they
are
beguiling
when
the
mammy
and
the
daddy
are
upon
the
babies
smiling
oh
this
pretty
little
garden
which
every
one
admires
which
pleased
his
grace
the
noble
duke
to
give
our
little
squires
the
news
was
something
wonderful
like
the
shooting
of
a
rocket
when
they
heard
that
they
had
got
a
park
and
were
out
in
this
pretty
little
garden
with
all
its
blossom
blooming
we
can
sit
and
sing
the
whole
day
long
from
the
morning
till
the
gloaming
and
tell
dame
blunders
when
her
sons
were
naught
but
asses
and
could
not
even
raise
a
park
to
please
the
upper
classes
then
let
us
give
the
noble
duke
the
praises
of
the
for
if
we
did
not
thank
his
grace
we
should
commit
an
and
not
forgetting
leach
for
he
deserves

this

the
tartan
plaid
in
auld
lang
syne
heard
say
my
granny
then
she
wore
a
bonnie
scottish
tartan
plaid
in
them
good
days
yore
weel
i
ken
when
i
was
young
some
happy
days
we
had
when
ladies
they
were
so
gay
in
scottish
tartan
plaid
me
thinks
i
see
my
father
now
sat
working
at
his
i
see
my
mother
at
the
in
our
dear
village
home
the
i
hear
again
its
makes
me
sad
to
think
those
happy
days
are
gone
when
weaving
tartan
plaid
it
is
not
in
a
clannish
view
for
clans
are
naught
to
me
but
our
ancient
tartan
plaid
i
dearly
love
to
see
something
grand
ye
will
agree
to
see
a
highland
lad
in
his
celtic
native
garb
the
grand
old
tartan
plaid
our
soldier
lads
in
tartan
kilts
outshine
our
warriors
bold
who
dress
in
scarlet
green
and
blue
decked
off
with
shining
gold
just
see
our
kilted
lads
so
brave
it
makes
my
heart
feel
glad
and
me
of
my
boyish
days
when
in
tartan
plaid
wad
some
the
hint
we
give
our
sovereign
lady
queen
to
dress
herself
and
lady
maids
in
bonnie
tartan
sheen
then
treadles
shuttles
warp
and
for
trade
would
not
be
bad
would
rattle
as
in
days
of
yore
when
weaving
tartan
plaid
the
box
thou
odious
box
as
i
look
on
thee
i
wonder
wilt
thou
be
unlocked
for
me
no
no
forbear
then
yet
then
thy
grim
lid
do
lie
the
men
whom
blasted
arrows
hit
and
send
them
to
the
pit
o
dig
a
grave
somewhere
for
me
deep
underneath
some
tree
or
bury
me
on
the
wildest
heath
where
boreas
blows
his
wildest
breath
or
some
wild
romantic
rocks
but
oh
forbear
the
box
throw
me
into
the
ocean
deep
where
many
poor
forgotten
sleep
or
fling
my
corpse
in
the
battle
mound
with
coffinless
thousands
the
ground
i
envy
not
the
mightiest
dome
but
save
me
from
a
tomb
i
care
not
if
the
wild
glen
or
the
prison
yard
with
wicked
men
or
into
some
filthy
anywhere
anywhere
out
of
the
world
in
fire
or
smoke
on
land
or
sea
than
thy
grim
lid
be
closed
on
me
but
let
me
pause
ere
i
say
more
about
thee
unoffending
door
when
i
bethink
me
now
i
pause
it
is
not
thee
who
makes
the
laws
but
villians
who
if
all
were
just
in
thy
grim
cell
would
lay
their
dust
but
yet
grand
beneath
yond
wall
to
lie
with
friends
all
if
sculptured
tombstones
were
not
there
but
simple
grass
with
daisies
fair
and
were
it
not
grim
box
for
thee
paradise
o
cemetery
the
vale
of
aire
it
was
early
in
the
morning
that
i
took
my
ramble
i
had
noticed
but
little
until
i
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
quaint
old
hamlet
of
marley
my
spirits
began
to
be
cheered
for
lively
gratitude
glowed
in
my
heart
at
the
wild
romantic
scenery
before
me
passing
the
old
mansion
i
wended
my
way
towards
the
huge
crag
called
the
wild
and
rugged
as
the
scenery
was
it
furnished
an
agreeable
entertainment
to
my
mind
and
with
pleasure
i
pushed
my
way
to
the
top
of
the
gigantic
rock
where
i
viewed
the
grandeur
of
the
vale
below
the
blossom
on
the
branches
the
crooked
aire
gliding
along
like
sheets
of
polished
crystal
made
me
poetic
i
thought
of
nicholson
the
poet
of
this
beautiful
vale
and
reclining
on
a
green
bank
i
framed
these
words
poet
nicholson
old
darling
bard
accept
from
me
at
least
one
tributary
line
yet
how
much
more
should
be
thy
just
reward
than
any
wild
unpolished
song
of
mine
no
monument
in
marble
can
i
raise
or
sculptured
bust
in
honour
of
thy
name
but
humbly
try
to
celebrate
thy
praise
and
give
applause
that
thou
shouldst
duly
claim
all
hail
the
songsters
that
awake
the
morn
and
soothe
the
soul
with
wild
melodious
strains
all
hail
the
rocks
that
bingley
hills
adorn
beneath
whose
shades
wild
grandeur
reigns
from
off
yon
rock
that
rears
its
head
so
high
and
overlooks
the
crooked
river
aire
while
musing
works
full
meet
the
eye
the
envied
game
the
lark
and
timid

queen
of

people
throughout

one
of
your
loyal
and
faithful
subjects
desires
most
respectfully
to
approach
your
majesty
to
congratulate
you
upon
the
completion
of
the
fiftieth
year
of
your
reign
in
the
same
year
of
your
coronation
in
a
wild
part
of
old
yorkshire
where
it
is
said
the
wind
never
blew
nor
the
cock
ever
crew
was
your
most
gracious
humble
servant
born
and
at
the
very
hour
that
your
majest
ascended
the
throne
a
kind
good
yorkshire
mother
was
rocking
her
baby
in
an
old
oak
cradle
while
the
father
was
treading
the
treadles
and
picking
the
shuttle
of
his
old
to
the
tune
of
never
shall
be
and
i
am
proud
to
convey
to
your
majesty
that
the
child
in
the
old
oak
cradle
was
no
less
a
person
than
your
humble
and
obedient
servant
bill
hoylus
end
poet
and
philosopher
to
the
plebians
of
keighley
and
who
now
rejoices
in
the
fiftieth
year
of
your
reign
that
he
has
been
blessed
with
good
health
during
that
long
period
having
had
at
no
time
occasion
to
call
in
a
physician
john
barleycorn
has
been
my
medical
adviser
and
when
i
begin
to
review
the
fifty
years
of
your
most
illustrious
reign
from
my
birth
i
feel
grateful
indeed
for
great
and
mighty
men
and
nations
have
risen
and
fallen
but
i
am
proud
to
think
that
your
most
gracious
majesty
and
your
humble
servant
have
weathered
the
storm
and
i
also
can
assure
your
majesty
that
the
lukewarm
loyalty
of
the
upper
ten
is
not
a
sample
of
people
here
for
during
the
latter
half
of
your
reign
up
to
now
prosperity
has
shone
upon
the
once
crooked
old
town
for
wealth
has
been
accumulated
to
the
tune
of
millions
which
i
am
sorry
to
inform
your
majesty
is
in
the
hands
of
those
who
mean
to
keep
it
one
portion
of
your
lukewarm
loyal
subjects
have
the
advancement
of
art
and
science
so
much
on
the
brain
that
it
is
feared
they
will
go
stark
mad
i
have
also
much
pleasure
in
informing
your
gracious
majesty
that
his
grace
the
duke
of
devonshire
has
presented
the
people
of
keighley
with
a
plot
of
ground
to
be
called
the
devonshire
park
which
will
be
opened
on
the
occasion
of
your
jubilee
also
that
henry
isaac
butterfield
esquire
of
bonny
cliffe
castle
has
erected
a
structure
to
be
called
the
jubilee
tower
which
will
be
opened
on
the
day
of
your
grand
jubilee
to
commemorate
your
glorious
reign
this
gentleman
is
a
native
of
keighley
and
fairly
entitled
to
be
knighted
by
your
gracious
majesty
seeing
that
he
has
done
more
to
beautify
the
town
than
all
the
rest
it
has
also
been
given
out
that
the
town
has
to
be
honoured
by
a
royal
visit
from
your
grandson
prince
george
but
pray
take
a
advice
your
majesty
and
let
him
come
unless
he
is
able
to
pay
his
own
expenses
for
i
can
assure
his
royal
highness
that
this
is
the
city
of
number
oneism
yet
with
the
exception
of
parting
with
the
bawbees
i
dare
be
sworn
that
your
subjects
in
keighley
are
the
grand
and
genuine
men
of
the
shire
take
them
in
art
and
science
flood
or
field
i
sincerely
hope
that
your
most
gracious
majesty
will
excuse
the
blunt
and
bard
who
will
ever
remain
your
most
humble
and
obedient
servant
hoylus
end

your
most
humble
pardon
for
since
i
addressed
your
most
gracious
majesty

note

come
to
me

subscribed
and

splendid
ox

weak
bard
but
thou
dost
try
in
vain
to
tune
that
mighty
harp
again
to
try
thy
muse
in
far
behind
and
yet
to
praise
him
thou
it
is
thy
mind
he
who
sang
of
command
at
bannockburn
with
sword
in
hand
and
bid
his
warriors
firmly
stand
upon
the
spot
and
bid
the
foemen
leave
the
land
or
face
the
scot
he
who
freed
the
human
mind
of
superstitious
weak
and
blind
he
who
peered
the
scenes
behind
their
holy
how
orthodox
its
pockets
lined
with
canting
prayers
yes
he
whose
short
span
appears
mixed
up
with
joyous
smiles
and
tears
so
interwove
with
doubts
and
fears
his
harp
did
ring
and
made
the
world
to
its
ears
and
hear
him
sing
his
to
walk
the
lonely
glen
betimes
to
shun
the
haunts
of
men
searching
for
his
magic
poetic
fire
and
far
beyond
the
human
ken
he
strung
the
lyre
and
well
old
scotland
may
be
proud
to
hear
her
burns
proclaimed
aloud
for
to
her
sons

charm
for

in

how
sweet
and
remote
from
all
turmoil
and

in

my

the
miser
that
wanders
besides

his
eyes
ever
led
to
the
spot
in

how
different
to
him
is
my
rapture
and
pleasure
near
the
dear
little
cot
on

but
sooin
may

mary
me
but
sweeter
fairer
betide
thee
in
ahr
sweet
little
cot
on
the
benks
the
aire
in
memory
of
peckover
july
he
was
a
man
an
upright
man
as
ever
trod
this
mortal
earth
and
now
upon
him
back
we
scan
whose
greatest
fault
was
honest
mirth
but
never
more
his
friends
will
see
the
smiling
face
and
laughing
eye
nor
hear
his
jokes
with
heartfelt
glee
which
made
dull
care
before
them
fly
nor
ever
more
the
friend
shall
find
when
labour
lacks
the
shake
of
hand
that
oft
was
wont
to
leave
behind
what
proved
a
brother
and
a
friend
in
bitter
biting
frost
or
hail
or
snow
or
rain
or
sleet
the
wretch
upon
tempest
in
him
found
shelter
from
the
street
the
unemployed
the
aged
poor
the
orphan
child
the
lame
and
blind
the
stranger
never
crossed
his
floor
but
what
a
friend
in
him
did
find
but
now
the
hand
and
heart
are
gone
which
were
so
noble
kind
and
true
and
now
his
friends
every
one
are
loth
to
bid
a
last
adieu

of
bird
dame
a
burlesque
on
the
war
dame
europe
kept
a
and
she
was
fond
of
brass
she
took
in
public
lodgers
of
every
rank
and
class
french
and
german
dutch
and
swiss
and
other
nations
too
so
poor
old
europe
had
lots
of
work
to
do
i
can
not
just
now
name
her
beds
her
number
being
so
large
but
five
she
kept
for
deputies
which
she
had
in
her
charge
so
in
this
famous
john
bull
he
stood
on
him
she
always
kept
an
eye
to
see
things
rightly
done
and
master
louis
was
her
next
and
second
no
doubt
for
when
a
little
row
took
place
he
always
backed
john
out
and
in
her
house
was
alex
russ
oft
him
they
eyed
with
fear
for
alex
was
a
lazy
hound
and
kept
a
russian
bear
her
fourth
was
a
man
of
grace
who
was
for
heaven
bent
his
name
was
pious
william
he
read
his
testament
her
fifth
too
was
a
pious
knave
and
our
firm
belief
he
once
did
rob
the
hungary
lads
of
bread
and
beef
these
were
dame
deputies
in
whom
she
put
her
trust
to
keep
her
at
peace
in
case
eruption
burst
for
many
a
time
a
row
took
place
while
sharing
out
the
scran
but
john
and
louis
soon
in
and
cleared
the
once
alex
father
nick
a
bit
before
he
died
did
roughly
seize
a
little
turk
and
thought
to
warm
his
hide
but
john
and
louis
interfered
declaring
it
foul
play
and
made
old
nick
remember
it
until
his
dying
day
now
all
dame
deputies
they
made
themselves
at
home
and
every
lodger
knew
his
bed
likewise
his
sitting
room
they
took
great
interest
in
their
beds
and
kept
them
very
clean
unlike
some
other
so
dirty
and
so
mean
the
best
and
choicest
bed
of
all
was
occupied
by
johnny
because
the
dame
did
favour
him
he
did
collect
her
money
and
in
a
little
bunk
he
lived
up
with
oak
and
he
would
not
let
a
single
one
come
near
within
a
yard
a
too
was
john
and
aught
do
for
brass
and
what
he
ever
took
in
hand
no
one
could
him
surpass
when
tired
of
being
shut
in
the
bunk
sometimes
he
went
across
to
spend
an
hour
with
master
loo
and
they
the
wine
would
toss
so
many
a
happy
day
they
spent
these
lads
with
one
another
while
every
lodger
in
the
house
thought
john
was
brother
the
dame
allowed
john
something
nice
to
get
well
in
her
rent
which
every
now
and
then
he
put
it
on
per
cent
and
working
very
hard
himself
amongst
his
tar
and
pitch
he
soon
accumulated
wealth
that
made
him
very
rich
now
louis
had
a
pleasant
crib
which
was
admired
by
lots
and
being
close
by
a
window
he
had
some
flower
pots
the
next
to
bed
was
will
the
biggest
monitor
and
though
he
did
pretend
a
saint
he
was
as
big
a
cur
he
loved
to
make
them
all
believe
he
was
opposed
to
strife
and
said
he
never
caused
a
row
no
never
in
his
life
he
was
so
fond
of
singing
psalms
and
he
read
his
testament
that
everybody
was
deceived
when
he
was
mischief
bent
he
seldom
passed
a
bed
but
what
he
took
a
glance
which
made
them
every
one
suspect
rob
if
a
chance
now
louis
had
two
flower
pots
he
nourished
with
much
care
but
little
knew
that
eyes
were
set
upon
the
pair
in
one
there
grew
an
alsace
rose
the
other
a
lorraine
and
willie
vowed
they
once
were
his
and
must
be
his
again
he
said
his
father
once
lodged
there
and
that
the
dame
did
know
that
predecessors
once
had
sneaked
them
in
a
row
in
council
was
a
lad
well
up
to
every
quirk
to
keep
him
out
of
mischief
long
dame
europe
had
her
work
to
this
smart
youth
saint
willie
did
whisper
his
desire
one
night
as
they
sat
smoking
besides
the
kitchen
get
them
flowers
back
again
said
bissy
very
low
louis
somewhere
on
the
quiet
and
try
to
cause
a
row
mind
the
other
deputies
catch
you
on
the
hop
for
john
and
joseph
you
must
know
your
little
game
would
stop
joseph
he
has
not
forgot
the
day
you
warmed
his
rig
and
christian
denmark
still
thinks
on
about
his
nice
your
advice
my
own
dear
mark
i
have
been
guided
on
but
what
about
that
man
pointing
to
john
very
plucky
too
is
john
but
yet
very
slow
and
perhaps
he
never
may
perceive
our
scheme
about
the
row
not
another
word
of
this
to
ears
the
dame
she
plays
the
i
have
my
doubts
and
fears
let
us
go
upstairs
at
once
i
think
it
will
be
best
and
let
us
pray
to
him
above
before
we
go
to
so
with
a
pious
countenance
his
prayers
as
usual
said
but
squinting
round
the
room
the
while
he
spied
an
empty
bed
a
pity
that
these
empty
stocks
should
be
unoccupied
do
you
think
my
little
cousin
mark
to
them
could
be
denied
just
the
very
thing
said
mark
cousin
sir
and
you
would
carry
out
my
scheme
one
at
each
side
of
the
dame
being
asked
did
not
object
if
he
could
pay
the
rent
and
had
a
decent
character
and
louis
would
consent
i
do
object
to
this
says
loo
on
this
very
ground
willie
and
his
cousins
they
soon
would
me
surround
nothing
in
my
line
at
all
they
are
so
near
and
so
if
i
consent
to
this
at
once
hem
me
you
think
it
master
loo
that
i
should
do
you
harm
for
i
read
my
testament
and
i
sing
my
all
my
eye
said
louis
your
testament
and
psalms
you
use
the
dumbbells
regular
to
strengthen
up
your
arms
take
your
poor
relation
off
you
prig
and
open
out
kit
box
and
give
him
back
come
says
europe
have
no
bother
here
trying
now
to
breed
a
row
at
least
it
does
now
johnny
hearing
from
the
bunk
what
both
of
them
did
say
he
shouted
out
stop
it
will
or
else
rue
the
right
friend
john
much
obliged
you
are
my
friend
i
know
and
so
my
little
cousin
sir
willing
to
but
louis
frothed
at
mouth
with
rage
like
one
that
was
insane
and
said
make
bill
promise
him
not
offend
again
promise
no
such
thing
says
mark
that
would
hurt
your
pride
sing
on
and
read
your
testament
dame
on
your
to
promise
aught
like
that
be
against
my
mind
so
take
it
right
or
take
it
wrong
promise
naught
i
shall
take
and
wallop
thee
unless
thou
cuts
thy
stick
and
drive
thee
to
thy
fatherland
before
another
on
cried
sanctimonius
and
sending
out
his
arm
he
caught
poor
louis
on
the
nose
then
sung
another
psalm
but
louis
soon
was
on
his
pins
and
used
his
fists
a
bit
but
he
was
fairly
out
of
breath
and
seldom
ever
hit
and
at
the
end
of
round
the
first
he
got
it
fearful
hot
this
was
his
baptism
of
fire
if
we
mistake
it
not
so
willie
sent
a
letter
home
to
mother
old
augusta
telling
her
thrashed
poor
loo
and
given
him
such
a
duster
wonderful
events
says
he
heaven
brought
about
fight
the
greatest
pugilist
that
ever
was
brought
out
and
if
by
divine
providence
i
get
safe
through
this
row
then
i
will
sing
god
the
spring
from
whom
all
blessings
meanwhile
the
other
monitors
were
standing
looking
on
but
none
of
them
dare
speak
a
word
but
all
stared
straight
at
john
not
i
to
interfere
says
johnny
to
the
rest
but
he
was
told
by
every
one
neutrality
was
best
john
hate
the
word
poison
to
my
ear
another
word
for
cowardice
and
makes
me
fit
to
swear
any
rate
i
can
do
this
my
mind
i
will
not
mask
give
poor
loo
a
little
drop
out
of
my
brandy
flask
give
it
up
poor
loo
my
lad
you
might
as
well
give
in
you
know
that
i
have
got
no
power
besides
you
did
then
louis
rose
and
looked
at
john
and
spoke
of
days
gone
by
when
he
would
not
have
seen
his
friend
have
blackened
eye
as
for
giving
in
friend
john
do
nothing
of
the
sort
do
you
think
be
a
for
this
conversation
that
took
place
made
pious
willie
grin
and
tell
john
bull
to
hold
his
noise
nought
to
do
with
him
these
words
to
john
did
make

and
finding
to
his
shame
that
those
were
worse
who
did
look
on
than
those
who
played
the
game
now
europe
knew
the
facts
which
had
been
going

with
her
usual
dignity
these
words
addressed
to
john
bull
pray
answer
me
why
are
you
gaping
here
you
are
my
famous
deputy
then
why
not
interfere
answered
john
and
made
a
bow
but
yet
was
very
shy
was
told
to
be
a
neutral
and
the
reason
just
what
you
should
not
have
done
being
in
authority
did
i
not
place
you
in
that
bunk
to
think
and
act
for
me
any
baby
in
the
house
could
not
have
done
much
worse
but
i
fancy
been
holding
back
to
save
your
private
purse
is
as
fine
a
word
as
ever
a
coward
used
the
honour
that
i
gave
to
you
you
have
the
minor
lodgers
in
the
house
on
hearing
this
to
john
began
to
whisper
and
to
laugh
and
it
famous
fun
at
last
a
little
urchin
said
take
my
oath
master
john
was
neutral
and
stuck
up
for
them
up
for
both
offended
both
yes
that
is
what
you
mean
continued
madame
europe
then
spoke
to
john
again
tell
you
what
it
is
john
long
your
career
you
take
your
advice
to
save
your
paltry
sums
a
year
bob
and
bill
besides
some
more
that
i
call
naught
but
scums
got
you
fairly
in
between
their
fingers
and
their
thumbs
such
like
men
as
ben
and
hugh
this
day
your
fags
had
been
they
would
have
saved
both
you
and
me
this
disgraceful
scene
of
and
shod
as
everybody
knows
you
would
have
dared
these
rivals
now
to
come
to
such
like
blows
was
a
time
in
this
house
john
if
you
put
up
your
thumb
the
greatest
blackguard
tongue
would
stop
as
if
they
had
been
dumb
not
a
one
in
this

this

all
you

all
you

your

then
you

john

let
poor
louis
sup
on
both
i

my
ointment

their
wounds

up

said
the

was
affected
sore

you
have
some
small
excuse
that
you
have
done
it
for
have
some
little
hopes
left
yet
that
you
may
yet
have
sense
to
know
your
high
position
john
instead
of
saving
pence
yet
will
learn
that
duty
sir
can
not
be
ignored
however
disagreeable
when
placed
before
the
board
let
me
tell
you
he
who
shirks
the
responsibility
of
seeing
right
is
doing
wrong
and
earns
humility
an
dream
to
boast
of
skill
and
power
but
dare
not
even
interfere
at
this
important
hour
far
confess
at
once
not
fit
for
your
place
than
have
a
name
sir
branded
with
disgrace
not
say
another
word

deputies
to
you

hope
you
will
a
warning

the

that

there

oh

to

if
i
tell
it
in

for
when
i
look
back
on
the
sights
that
were
there
i
could
almost
like

dance
high
in

for
when
i
reflect
my
heart
leaps
with
what
i
saw
in
my
dream
in
old
be
i
for
thousands
were
shouting
on
that
pleasant
day
we
are
all
be
hip
hip
hip
hurrah
and
i
took
the
first
chance
to
ask
what
it
meant
of
the
people
who
shouted
what
was
their
intent
when
an
elderly
lady
soon
gave
me
the
cue
of
what
was
the
matter
and
what
was
to
do
six
great
millocrats
call
them
whigs
if
you
will
the
gods
of
our
labour
in
workshop
and
mill
have
all
turned
their
colours
from
yellow
to
blue
which
has
caused
this
commotion
the
city
all
through
led
on
by
the
nose
like
a
bull
in
a
band
see
how
all
the
be
follow
so
grand
the
fag
and
the
artist
the
plebian
also
have
now
their
colour
from
yellow
to

thousand
true
be
here
and
not
a

amongst
them
swear
for
the
millocrats
chieftains
proclaimed
it
they
say
that
all
must
turn
tories
on
this
very
day
so
upon
the
procession
i
did
my
eyes
fix
reviewing
and
skewing
this
wonderful
six
they
wore
blue
ribands
so
grand
in
their
coats
singing
be
joskins

us
your

the
be
exerted
each
nerve
and
limb
to
follow
their
leaders
and
join
in
the

and
i
plainly
could
see
so
i
thought
in
my
dream
that
the
way
through
the
world
is
to
follow
the
stream
for
the
faces
of
parsons
were
lit
up
so
bright
and
the
doctors
they
smiled
with
the
greatest
delight
and
a
lawyer
he
vowed
that
have
a
blue
gown
for
been
long
enough
a
black
liberal
clown
methought
the
ranters
and
methodies
too
independents
and
quakers
and
baptists
were
blue
and
as
i
looked
round
me
lo
what
did
i
see
a
batch
of
teetotallers
had
got
on
the
spree
but
what
i
considered
the
best
of
the
sport
took
place
in
front
of
the
old
county
court
the
mayor
and
were
dancing
a
jig
with
the
county
court
judge
in
his
gown
and
his
wig
methought
that
the
draper
and
hatter
filed
in
along
with
the
grocer
his
nearest
of
kin
and
i
caught
the
just
in
the
neck
in
his
hand
were
his
divi
and
new
silver
check
methought
as
i
walked
i
sprang
up
so
high
that
i
really
found
out
i
was
able
to
fly
so
backwards
and
forwards
methought
that
i
flew
to
the
clubs
of
the
town
which
i
found
were
all
blue
till
somehow
or
other
i
got
quite
astray

over

i
wingéd
my
way

i
some

geese

old
england
would
be
soon
or
late
how
nations
would
rise
and
would
fall
and
tyrants
would
tremble
and
go
to
the
wall
he
was
very
well
read
though
papers
were
dear
but
he
got
newspaper
year
after
year
it
was
bound
to
his
bosom
and
he
read
it
so
keen
while
at
times
he
fair
hated
a
king
or
a
queen
he
was
fairly
dramatic
the
stage
he
loved
well
the
names
of
great
actors
and
plays
he
would
tell
and
if
that
his
notion
it
took
the
other
way
he
could
quote
the
bible
a
night
and
a
day
full
of
wit
full
of
mirth
he
could
give
you
a
sting
he
could
preach
he
could
pray
he
could
dance
he
could
sing
he
could
play
pitch
and
toss
he
could
jump
he
could
run
he
could
shuffle
the
cards
he
could
handle
a
gun
the
old
constable
knew
him
but
let
him
alone
because
he
knew
better
than
bother
with
for
the
lads
of
the
barracks
and
the
pinfold
as
well
would
all
have
been
there
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
old
keighley
was
then
but
a
very
small
town
yet
twelve
hundred
combers
that
were
very
well
known
hundreds
have
gone
over
the
dark
flowing
burn
whence
no
traveller
was
ever
yet
known
to
return
it
reminds
me
again
of
the
donkey
and
pack
which
came
from
the
hills
bringing
wool
on
its
back
and
if
the
poor
beast
perchance
had
to
bray
a
true
sign
a
comber
would
die
on
that
day
the
third
day
of
the
week
sometimes
further
on
the
old
woman
would
seek
the
arms
for
her
son
and
if
she
were
told
he
had
not
been
at
all
would
bounce
over
the
green
to
the
hi
those
were
fine
times
especially
the
fairs
when
the
inns
were
kept
open
for
dancing
upstairs
the
commercial
lord
rodney
as
well
as
the
crown
to
the
ancient
were
fairly
well
known
but
now
get
back
to
the
pot
and
the
pad
the
fair
it
is
over
the
women
are
glad
for
now
the
his
follies
he
sees
and
makes
resolutions
as
staunch
as
you
please
for
now
he
commences
to
work
hard
and
late
he
is
building
a
castle
on
a
phantom
estate
and
he
toils
for
a
time
but
long
hoggs
make
him
sick
then
he
duffs
and
his
castle
falls
down
every
brick
when
winter
comes
in
with
its
keen
bitter
blast
and
the
poor
rustic
hind
has
to
cope
with
the
frost
yet
the
comber
was
happy
in
village
and
town
though
he
knew
that
his
calling
was
fast
going
down
oh
yes
it
was
vanquished
the
once
noble
art
for
science
had
bid
it
for
ever
depart
yet
for
thee
old
comber
fresh
fields
have
arose
that
have
found
thee
in
victuals
in
fuel
and
clothes
so
many
brave
thanks
to
the
mayor
of
the
town
who
has
made
the
once
more
to
be
known
let
us
drink
to
the
health
of
our
worthy
host
the
friend
of
the
comber
the
knight
of
the
post
village
in
a
little
cot
so
dreary
with
eyes
and
forehead
hot
and
bleary
sat
a
mother
sad
and
weary
with
her
darling
on
her
knee
their
humble
fare
at
best
was
sparing
for
the
father
he
was
shearing
with
his
three
brave
sons
of
erin
all
down
in
the
fen
countree
all
her
saxon
neighbours
leave
her
with
her
boy
and
demon
fever
the
midnight
to
relieve
her
save
a
little
busy
bee
he
was
called
the
noisy
as
a
larum
yet
his
treasures
he
would
share
with
his
friend
right
merrily
every
night
and
every
morning
with
the
day
sometimes
at
while
lay
mother
sick
and
to
his
dying
mate
went
he
robbing
his
good
saxon
mother
giving
to
his
celtic
brother
who
asked
for
him
and
no
other
until
his
spirit
it
was
free
saw
the
shroud
and
saw
the
coffin
brought
the
pipes
and
brought
the
snuff
in
this
little
ruffian
to
the
wake
each
night
went
he
sabbath
morning
he
was
ready
the
bearers
to
be
steady
taking
peter
to
his
beddy
and
a
tear
stood
in
his
onward
as
the
corpse
was
passing
ere
the
priest
gave
his
last
blessing
through
the
dingy
crowd
came
pressing
the
father
and
the
brothers
three
our
will
greet
her
how
is
this
that
here

meet
her

mystery

interfered

corpse
will
be
interred

with
us
and
see
it
buried
out
in
yonder
soon
they
knew
the
worst
and
pondered
and
and
returning
home
they
wondered
who
their
little
friend
could
be
turning
round
to
him
they
bowed
much
they
thanked
him
much
they
owed
while
the
tears
each
cheek
bedewed
him
all
prosperity

said

innocent
dreams
no

this
life
then
troubled
my
breast
i
wor
like
a
young
bird
new
fligged
fra
its
nest
my
dear
little
mates
did
i
frolic
and
play
wal
sweetest
moments
wor
flying
away
as
the
dew
kissed
the
daisies
their
portals
to
close
at
neet
my
bed
i
did
sweetly
repose
rose
in
the
morning
at
command
till
fra
boyhood
to
manhood
my
frame
did
expand
the
faces
that
once
were
familiar
to
me
those
that
did
laugh
at
my
innocent
glee
i
fancy
i
see
them
now
far
away
or
bingley
they
may
lay
for
since
embarked
on
stormy
seas
my
like
the
billows
nivver
at
ease
yet
i
still
hev
a
hope
my
last
moments
to
in
thee
dearest
village
to
lay
myself
down
the
heroic
watchman
of
calversyke
hill
this
extraordinary
either
bore
false
witness
against
his
neighbour
a
poor
artisan
or
taking
his
own
word
for
it
saved
the
nation
from
great
disaster
and
ruin
by
putting
out
a
fire
that
no
one
saw
but
himself
heard
of
great
fires
in
city
and
town
and
many
disasters
by
fire
are
known
but
surely
this
fire
which
going
to
tell
was
worse
than
mount
etna
vesuvius
or
hell
for
the
great
prophecy
it
no
doubt
would
fulfil
but
for
watchman
at
calversyke
hill
this
fire
broke
out
in
the
night
it
was
said
while
peaceful
each
villager
slept
in
his
bed
and
so
greatly
the
flames
did
light
up
the
skies
that
it
took
the
big
watchman
all
in
surprise
yet
great
was
the
courage
and
undaunted
the
skill
of
the
watchman
of
calversyke
hill
he
swore
by
his
maker
the
flames
rose
so
high
that
within
a
few
yards
they
reached
to
the
sky
and
so
greatly
they
lighted
up
mountains
and
dales
he
could
see
into
ireland
scotland
and
wales
and
so
easily
the
beaks
did
swallow
his
pill
they
fined
the
poor
artist
of
calversyke
hill
now
some
foolish
people
are
led
to
suppose
it
was
by
some
shavings
this
fire
first
arose
but
yet
says
our
hero
greatly
suspect
this
fire
was
caused
by
the
grossest
neglect
but
glad
its
put
out
let
it
be
as
it
will
says
the
watchman
of
calversyke
hill
he
needed
no
witness
to
swear
what
done
yet
if
he
had
wanted
he
could
have
had
one
for
one
tommy
twister
that
never
was
there
saw
the
sparks
from
the
chimney
as
they
flew
in
the
air
the
greatest
sized
no
doubt
they
would
fill
like
the
head
of
the
of
calversyke
hill
so
many
brave
thanks
to
this
knave
for
thousands
of
lives
no
doubt
he
did
save
and
but
for
this
hero
disaster
had
spread
and
smothered
the
nation
while
sleeping
in
bed
but
to
save
all
his
people
it
was
the
will
through
the
watchman
at
calversyke
hill
so
mind
and
be
careful
and
put
out
your
lights
all
ye
with
red
noses
in
case
they
ignite
or
perhaps
from
your
bed
you
may
have
to
leap
in
case
this
great
watchman
chances
to
sleep
for
as
rumours
are
spread
he
is
fond
of
his
gill
is
the
watchman
of
calversyke
hill
the
english
lines
written
on
the
keighley
cricket
club

most
respectfully
dedicated
to
the
late
william
luke
brown
esq
i
sing
not
of
war
nor
diplomatic
rage
but
i
shall
string
my
harp
in
praise
of
the
worthies
of
our
age
they
are
a
class
of
noble
men
whom
england
holds
most
dear
whose
feats
so
grand
adorn
our
land
like
the
famous
cricketeer
the
ancient
greek
his
chariot
ran
it
was
his
royal
sport
the
roman
gladiator
fought
to
please
the
royal
court
the
spaniard
with
his
javelin
knife
the
wild
flesh
he
tears
but
alack
what
sports
are
they
with
our
grand
cricketeers
and
well
old
keighley
can
be
proud
of
her
famed
sons
some
of
them
are
with
us
yet
while
others
are
away
brave
brown
brave
foulds
and
waring
with
good
men
in
the
rear
and
not
forgetting
emmett
the
brave
old
cricketeer
then
while
they
have
their
grand
bazaar
pray
let
us
rally
round
and
give
a
hand
to
renovate
their
cricket
ground
for
well
i
wot
both
young
and
old
will
find
from
year
to
year
more
interest
in
the
noble
sport
of
the
grand
old
cricketeer
the
mexican
may
throw
his
lance
the
scotchman
put
his
stone
with
all
the
scientific
skill
of
muscle
and
of
bone
give
switzerland
her
place
with
rifles
and
with
spears
but
give
to
me
our
grand
old
sport
our
famous
cricketeers
picture
rural
scene
christmas

sweet
lady
no
troubadour
that
sings
so
sweetly
at
your
door
to
tell
you
of
the
joys
in
store
so
grand
and
gay
but
one
that
sings
poor
christmas
within
some
gloomy
walls
just
cheer
the
locks
of
hoary
gray
and
try
to
smooth
their
rugged
way
with
cheerful
glow
and
cheer
the
heart
i
pray
crushed
down

make
the
weary
glad
and
cheer
the
orphan
lass
and
lad
make
heart
so
long
long
sad
your
kindness
feel
and
make
old
crazy
bones
stark
mad
to
dance
a
reel
then
peace
and
plenty
be
your
lot
and
may
your
deed
be
forgot
that
helps
the
widow
in
her
cot
from
out
your

nor

should
matter
not
the
poor
are

him
i
call
my
own
the
branches
the
woodbine
hide
my
little
cottage
wall
though
but
a
humble
thatch
i
envy
not
the
hall
the
wooded
hills
before
my
eyes
are
spread
both
far
and
wide
grandeur
seems
to
dress
in
all
her
lovely
pride
it
is
indeed
a
lovely
spot
singing
birds
flowers
grandeur
it
is
true
i
pass
away
my
hours
yet
think
not
this
lovely
glen
so
dear
in
all
its
charms
its
blossomed
banks
and
rippled
reels
freed
from
the
alarms
for
should
magic
change
the
scene
to
trackless
lands
unknown
eden
in
the
desert
wild
him
i
call
my
own
picture
decorative
picture
of
fern
it
so
me
bright
seem
the
days
when
i
wor
young
fra
thought
and
care
and
sorrow
free
as
wild
waves
rippled
the
sun
rolled
gaily
on
so
me
more
bright
the
flowers
when
i
wor
young
more
sweet
the
birds
sang
on
the
tree
while
pleasure
and
contentment
flung
her
smiles
on
them
and
so
me
the
naked
truth
i
told
when
young
though
tempted
hypocrisy
though
some
embraced
from
it
i
sprang
said
it
so
me
i
saw
the
canting
jibs
when
young
of
saintly
sulky
misery
yet
poked
i
ribs
and
said
it
so
me
though
monny
a
stone
when
i
wor
young
is
strong
upon
my
i
threw
when
young
hed
flung
if
they
forgive
so
me
could
money
buy
mart
again
our
brightest
days
to
see
monny
a
wun
wod
pawn
the
shirt
or
else
so
me
yet
after
all
i
oft
look
back
without
a
pang
days
gone
past
hope
all
i
did
when
young
may
be
to
me

last

new
