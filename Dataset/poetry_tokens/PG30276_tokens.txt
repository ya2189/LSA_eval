april
preface
in
march
a
volume
appeared
entitled
des
imagistes
it
was
a
collection
of
the
work
of
various
young
poets
presented
together
as
a
school
this
school
has
been
widely
discussed
by
those
interested
in
new
movements
in
the
arts
and
has
already
become
a
household
word
differences
of
taste
and
judgment
however
have
arisen
among
the
contributors
to
that
book
growing
tendencies
are
forcing
them
along
different
paths
those
of
us
whose
work
appears
in
this
volume
have
therefore
decided
to
publish
our
collection
under
a
new
title
and
we
have
been
joined
by
two
or
three
poets
who
did
not
contribute
to
the
first
volume
our
wider
scope
making
this
possible
in
this
new
book
we
have
followed
a
slightly
different
arrangement
to
that
of
the
former
anthology
instead
of
an
arbitrary
selection
by
an
editor
each
poet
has
been
permitted
to
represent
himself
by
the
work
he
considers
his
best
the
only
stipulation
being
that
it
should
not
yet
have
appeared
in
book
form
a
sort
of
informal
committee
consisting
of
more
than
half
the
authors
here
represented
have
arranged
the
book
and
decided
what
should
be
printed
and
what
omitted
but
as
a
general
rule
the
poets
have
been
allowed
absolute
freedom
in
this
direction
limitations
of
space
only
being
imposed
upon
them
also
to
avoid
any
appearance
of
precedence
they
have
been
put
in
alphabetical
order
as
it
has
been
suggested
that
much
of
the
misunderstanding
of
the
former
volume
was
due
to
the
fact
that
we
did
not
explain
ourselves
in
a
preface
we
have
thought
it
wise
to
tell
the
public
what
our
aims
are
and
why
we
are
banded
together
between
one
set
of
covers
the
poets
in
this
volume
do
not
represent
a
clique
several
of
them
are
personally
unknown
to
the
others
but
they
are
united
by
certain
common
principles
arrived
at
independently
these
principles
are
not
new
they
have
fallen
into
desuetude
they
are
the
essentials
of
all
great
poetry
indeed
of
all
great
literature
and
they
are
simply
these
to
use
the
language
of
common
speech
but
to
employ
always
the
word
not
the
nor
the
merely
decorative
word
to
create
new
rhythms
as
the
expression
of
new
moods
and
not
to
copy
old
rhythms
which
merely
echo
old
moods
we
do
not
insist
upon
as
the
only
method
of
writing
poetry
we
fight
for
it
as
for
a
principle
of
liberty
we
believe
that
the
individuality
of
a
poet
may
often
be
better
expressed
in
than
in
conventional
forms
in
poetry
a
new
cadence
means
a
new
idea
to
allow
absolute
freedom
in
the
choice
of
subject
it
is
not
good
art
to
write
badly
about
aeroplanes
and
automobiles
nor
is
it
necessarily
bad
art
to
write
well
about
the
past
we
believe
passionately
in
the
artistic
value
of
modern
life
but
we
wish
to
point
out
that
there
is
nothing
so
uninspiring
nor
so
as
an
aeroplane
of
the
year
to
present
an
image
hence
the
name
imagist
we
are
not
a
school
of
painters
but
we
believe
that
poetry
should
render
particulars
exactly
and
not
deal
in
vague
generalities
however
magnificent
and
sonorous
it
is
for
this
reason
that
we
oppose
the
cosmic
poet
who
seems
to
us
to
shirk
the
real
difficulties
of
his
art
to
produce
poetry
that
is
hard
and
clear
never
blurred
nor
indefinite
finally
most
of
us
believe
that
concentration
is
of
the
very
essence
of
poetry
the
subject
of
is
too
complicated
to
be
discussed
here
we
may
say
briefly
that
we
attach
the
term
to
all
that
increasing
amount
of
writing
whose
cadence
is
more
marked
more
definite
and
closer
knit
than
that
of
prose
but
which
is
not
so
violently
nor
so
obviously
accented
as
the
regular
verse
we
refer
those
interested
in
the
question
to
the
greek
melic
poets
and
to
the
many
excellent
french
studies
on
the
subject
by
such
distinguished
and
authors
as
remy
de
gourmont
gustave
kahn
georges
duhamel
charles
vildrac
henri
ghéon
robert
de
souza
andré
spire
etc
we
wish
it
to
be
clearly
understood
that
we
do
not
represent
an
exclusive
artistic
sect
we
publish
our
work
together
because
of
mutual
artistic
sympathy
and
we
propose
to
bring
out
our
coöperative
volume
each
year
for
a
short
term
of
years
until
we
have
made
a
place
for
ourselves
and
our
principles
such
as
we
desire

richard
aldington
childhood
i
the
bitterness
the
misery
the
wretchedness
of
childhood
put
me
out
of
love
with
god
i
ca
believe
in
god
goodness
i
can
believe
in
many
avenging
gods
most
of
all
i
believe
in
gods
of
bitter
dullness
cruel
local
gods
who
seared
my
childhood
ii
i
seen
people
put
a
chrysalis
in
a
to
see
they
told
me
what
sort
of
moth
would
come
but
when
it
broke
its
shell
it
slipped
and
stumbled
and
fell
about
its
prison
and
tried
to
climb
to
the
light
for
space
to
dry
its
wings
that
how
i
was
somebody
found
my
chrysalis
and
shut
it
in
a
my
shrivelled
wings
were
beaten
shed
their
colours
in
dusty
scales
before
the
box
was
opened
for
the
moth
to
fly
and
then
it
was
too
late
because
the
beauty
a
child
has
and
the
beautiful
things
it
learns
before
its
birth
were
shed
like
from
me
iii
i
hate
that
town
i
hate
the
town
i
lived
in
when
i
was
little
i
hate
to
think
of
it
there
were
always
clouds
smoke
rain
in
that
dingy
little
valley
it
rained
it
always
rained
i
think
i
never
saw
the
sun
until
i
was
nine
and
then
it
was
too
late
everything
too
late
after
the
first
seven
years
that
long
street
we
lived
in
was
duller
than
a
drain
and
nearly
as
dingy
there
were
the
big
college
and
the
there
were
the
sordid
provincial
shops
the
grocer
and
the
shops
for
women
the
shop
where
i
bought
transfers
and
the
piano
and
gramaphone
shop
where
i
used
to
stand
staring
at
the
huge
shiny
pianos
and
at
the
pictures
of
a
white
dog
looking
into
a
gramaphone
how
dull
and
greasy
and
grey
and
sordid
it
was
on
wet
days
it
was
always
wet
i
used
to
kneel
on
a
chair
and
look
at
it
from
the
window
the
dirty
yellow
trams
dragged
noisily
along
with
a
clatter
of
wheels
and
bells
and
a
humming
of
wires
overhead
they
threw
up
the
filthy
from
the
hollow
lines
and
then
the
water
ran
back
full
of
brownish
foam
bubbles
there
was
nothing
else
to
see
it
was
all
so
dull
except
a
few
grey
legs
under
shiny
black
umbrellas
running
along
the
grey
shiny
pavements
sometimes
there
was
a
waggon
whose
horses
made
a
strange
loud
hollow
sound
with
their
hoofs
through
the
silent
rain
and
there
was
a
grey
museum
full
of
dead
birds
and
dead
insects
and
dead
animals
and
a
few
relics
of
the
romans
dead
also
there
was
the
a
long
asphalt
walk
with
a
bleak
road
beside
it
three
piers
a
row
of
houses
and
a
salt
dirty
smell
from
the
little
harbour
i
was
like
a
moth
like
one
of
those
grey
emperor
moths
which
flutter
through
the
vines
at
capri
and
that
damned
little
town
was
my
against
whose
sides
i
beat
and
beat
until
my
wings
were
torn
and
faded
and
dingy
as
that
damned
little
town
iv
at
school
it
was
just
dull
as
that
dull
high
street
they
taught
me
pothooks
i
wanted
to
be
alone
although
i
was
so
little
alone
away
from
the
rain
the
dingyness
the
dullness
away
somewhere
else
the
town
was
dull
the
front
was
dull
the
high
street
and
the
other
street
were
dull
and
there
was
a
public
park
i
remember
and
that
was
damned
dull
too
with
its
beds
of
geraniums
no
one
was
allowed
to
pick
and
its
clipped
lawns
you
were
allowed
to
walk
on
and
the
pond
you
must
paddle
in
and
the
gate
made
out
of
a
whale
and
the
swings
which
were
for
children
and
its
gravel
paths
and
on
sundays
they
rang
the
bells
from
baptist
and
evangelical
and
catholic
churches
they
had
the
salvation
army
i
was
taken
to
a
high
church
the
parson
name
was
mowbray
which
is
a
good
name
but
he
thinks
too
much
of
it
that
what
i
heard
people
say
i
took
a
little
black
book
to
that
cold
grey
damp
smelling
church
and
i
had
to
sit
on
a
hard
bench
wriggle
off
it
to
kneel
down
when
they
sang
psalms
and
wriggle
off
it
to
kneel
down
when
they
prayed
and
then
there
was
nothing
to
do
except
to
play
trains
with
the
there
was
nothing
to
see
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
play
with
except
that
in
an
empty
room
upstairs
there
was
a
large
tin
box
containing
reproductions
of
the
magna
charta
of
the
declaration
of
independence
and
of
a
letter
from
raleigh
after
the
armada
there
were
also
several
packets
of
stamps
yellow
and
blue
guatemala
parrots
blue
stags
and
red
baboons
and
birds
from
sarawak
indians
and
from
the
united
states
and
the
green
and
red
portraits
of
king
francobollo
of
italy
v
i
do
believe
in
god
i
do
believe
in
avenging
gods
who
plague
us
for
sins
we
never
sinned
but
who
avenge
us
that
why
i
never
have
a
child
never
shut
up
a
chrysalis
in
a
for
the
moth
to
spoil
and
crush
its
bright
colours
beating
its
wings
against
the
dingy
the
poplar
why
do
you
always
stand
there
shivering
between
the
white
stream
and
the
road
the
people
pass
through
the
dust
on
bicycles
in
carts
in
the
waggoners
go
by
at
dawn
the
lovers
walk
on
the
grass
path
at
night
stir
from
your
roots
walk
poplar
you
are
more
beautiful
than
they
are
i
know
that
the
white
wind
loves
you
is
always
kissing
you
and
turning
up
the
white
lining
of
your
green
petticoat
the
sky
darts
through
you
like
blue
rain
and
the
grey
rain
drips
on
your
flanks
and
loves
you
and
i
have
seen
the
moon
slip
his
silver
penny
into
your
pocket
as
you
straightened
your
hair
and
the
white
mist
curling
and
hesitating
like
a
bashful
lover
about
your
knees
i
know
you
poplar
i
have
watched
you
since
i
was
ten
but
if
you
had
a
little
real
love
a
little
strength
you
would
leave
your
nonchalant
idle
lovers
and
go
walking
down
the
white
road
behind
the
waggoners
there
are
beautiful
beeches
down
beyond
the
hill
will
you
always
stand
there
shivering
water
ruffled
and
speckled
by
galloping
wind
which
puffs
and
spurts
it
into
tiny
pashing
breakers
dashed
with
afternoon
sunlight
the
shining
of
the
sun
upon
the
water
is
like
a
scattering
of
gold
in
a
long
wavering
irregular
flight
the
water
is
cold
to
the
eye
as
the
wind
to
the
cheek
in
the
budding
chestnuts
whose
sticky
buds
glimmer
and
are
open
the
starlings
make
their
and
the
blackbirds
in
the
grass
are
getting
as
fat
as
the
pigeons
this
is
brave
even
the
cold
wind
is
seeking
a
new
mistress

you
were
my
playmate
by
the
sea
we
swam
together
your
girl
body
had
no
breasts
we
found
prawns
among
the
rocks
we
liked
to
feel
the
sun
and
to
do
nothing
in
the
evening
we
played
games
with
the
others
it
made
me
glad
to
be
by
you
sometimes
i
kissed
you
and
you
were
always
glad
to
kiss
me
but
i
was
afraid
i
was
only
fourteen
and
i
had
quite
forgotten
you
you
and
your
name
i
pass
through
the
streets
she
who
touches
my
arm
and
talks
with
me
is
who
knows
helen

and
there
are
you
a
whore
in
oxford
street
epigrams
a
girl
you
were
that
clear
sicilian
fluting
that
pains
our
thought
even
now
you
were
the
notes
of
cold
fantastic
grief
some
few
found
beautiful
new
love
she
has
new
leaves
after
her
dead
flowers
like
the
little
which
the
frost
hurt
october
the
are
silver
for
lack
of
the
tree
blood
at
your
kiss
my
lips
become
like
the
autumn
the
faun
sees
snow
for
the
first
time
zeus
send
vengeance
on
these
oreads
who
strew
white
frozen
flecks
of
mist
and
cloud
over
the
brown
trees
and
the
tufted
grass
of
the
meadows
where
the
stream
runs
black
through
shining
banks
of
bluish
white
zeus
are
the
halls
of
heaven
broken
up
that
you
flake
down
upon
me
of
marble
dis
and
styx
when
i
stamp
my
hoof
the
jam
into
the
cleft
so
that
i
reel
upon
two
slippery
points
fool
to
stand
here
cursing
when
i
might
be
running
lemures
in
nineveh
and
beyond
nineveh
in
the
dusk

were
afraid
in

of
egypt
in
the
dusk
they
chanted
of
them
to
the
dead
in
my
lesbos
and
achaia
where
the
god
dwelt
we
knew
them
now
men
say
they
are
not
but
in
the
dusk
ere
the
white
sun
comes
a
gay
child
that
bears
a
white
candle
i
am
afraid
of
their
rustling
of
their
terrible
silence
the
menace
of
their
secrecy

touch
you

hard
as

like

the

i
the
darkness
rolls
upward
the
thick
darkness
carries
with
it
rain
and
a
ravel
of
cloud
the
sun
comes
forth
upon
earth
palely
the
dawn
leaves
me
facing
timidly
old
gardens
sunken
and
in
the
gardens
is
water
sombre
wreck
autumnal
leaves
shadowy
roofs
in
the
blue
mist
and
a
that
is
broken
o
old
pagodas
of
my
soul
how
you
glittered
across
green
trees
blue
and
cool
blue
tremulously
blow
faint
puffs
of
smoke
across
sombre
pools
the
damp
green
smell
of
rotted
wood
and
a
heron
that
cries
from
out

through
the
upland
meadows
i
go
alone
for
i
dreamed
of
someone
last
night
who
is
waiting
for
me
flower
and
blossom
tell
me
do
you
know
of
her
have
the
rocks
hidden
her
voice
they
are
very
blue
and
still
long
upward
road
that
is
leading
me
light
hearted
i
quit
you
for
the
long
loose
ripples
of
the
invite
me
to
dance
upon
them
quivering
grass
daintily
poised
for
her
foot
tripping
o
blown
clouds
could
i
only
race
up
like
you
oh
the
last
slopes
that
are
and
steep
look
the
sky
across
black
valleys
rise
aloft
jagged
unwrinkled
mountains
ranges
of
death
solitude
silence
iii
one
chuckles
by
the
brook
for
me
one
rages
under
the
stone
one
makes
a
spout
of
his
mouth
one
whispers
one
is
gone
one
over
there
on
the
water
spreads
cold
ripples
for
me
enticingly
the
vast
dark
trees
flow
like
blue
veils
of
tears
into
the
water
sour
sprites
moaning
and
chuckling
what
have
you
hidden
from
me
in
the
palace
of
the
blue
stone
she
lies
forever
bound
hand
and
foot
was
it
the
wind
that
rattled
the
reeds
together
dry
reeds
a
faint
shiver
in
the
grasses
iv
on
the
left
hand
there
is
a
temple
and
a
palace
on
the
side
in
scarlet
pass
over
the
glittering
tide
under
the
bridge
the
old
river
flows
low
and
monotonous
day
after
day
i
have
heard
and
have
seen
all
the
news
that
has
been
autumn
gold
and
spring
green
now
in
my
palace
i
see
crossing
the
river
pilgrims
of
autumn
in
the
afternoons
lotus
pools
petals
in
the
water
such
are
my
dreams
for
me
silks
are
outspread
i
take
my
ease
unthinking
v
and
now
the
lowest
is
drawn
across
the
disk
of
the
sun
old
friends
who
will
forget
me
soon
i
must
go
on
towards
those
blue
i
have
forgot
so
long
in
the
marsh
grasses
there
lies
forever
my
last
treasure
with
the
hope
of
my
heart
the
ice
is
glazing
over
torn
lanterns
flutter
on
the
leaves
is
snow
in
the
frosty
evening
toll
the
old
bell
for
me
once
in
the
sleepy
temple
perhaps
my
soul
will
hear
afterglow
before
the
stars
peep
i
shall
creep
out
into
darkness
london
excursion
great
walls
of
green
city
that
is
afar
we
gallop
along
alert
and
penetrating
roads
open
about
us
housetops
keep
at
a
distance
tendrils
swim
backwards
from
our
image
we
are
a
red
bulk
projecting
the
angular
city
in
shadows
at
our
feet
black
shapes
hump
and
growl
and
assemble
it
is
the
city
that
takes
us
to
itself
vast
thunder
riding
down
strange
skies
an
arch
under
which
we
slide
divides
our
lives
for
us
after
we
have
passed
it
we
know
we
have
left
something
behind
we
shall
not
see
again
passivity
gravity
are
changed
into
hesitating
clanking
pistons
and
wheels
the
trams
come
whooping
up
one
by
one
yellow
spreading
through
darkness
posters
squall
out
the
passengers
shrink
together
i
enter
indelicately
into
all
their
souls
it
is
a
glossy
skating
rink
on
which
winged
spirals
clasp
and
bend
each
other
and
suddenly
slide
backwards
towards
the
centre
after
a
release
a
second
arch
is
a
wall
to
separate
our
souls
from
rotted
cables
of
stale
greenness
a
shadow
cutting
off
the
country
from
us
out
of
it
rise
red
walls
yet
i
revolt
i
bend
i
twist
myself
i
curl
into
a
million
convolutions
pink
shapes
without
angle
anything
to
be
soft
and
woolly
anything
to
escape
sudden
lurch
of
clamours
two
more
viaducts
stretch
out
red
yokes
of
steel
crushing
my
rebellion
my
soul
shrieking
is
jolted
forwards
by
a
long
hot
bar
into
direct
distances
it
pierces
the
small
of
my
back
approach
only
this
morning
i
sang
of
roses
now
i
see
with
a
swift
stare
the
city
forcing
up
through
the
air
black
cubes
close
piled
and
some
over
my
roses
are
battered
into
pulp
and
there
swells
up
in
me
sudden
desire
for
something
changeless
thrusts
of
sunless
rock
unmelted
by
hissing
wheels
arrival
here
is
too
swift
a
movement
the
rest
is
too
still
it
is
a
red
sea
licking
the
housefronts
they
quiver
gently
from
base
to
summit
ripples
of
impulse
run
through
them
flattering
resistance
soon
they
will
fall
already
smoke
yearns
upward
clouds
of
dust
crash
of
collapsing
cubes
i
prefer
deeper
patience
monotony
of
stalled
beasts
o
vainly
have
you
prolonged
your
effort
for
i
descend
amid
you
past
rungs
and
slopes
of
curving
slippery
steel
walk
sudden
struggle
for
foothold
on
the
pavement
familiar
ascension
i
do
not
heed
the
city
any
more
it
has
given
me
a
duty
to
perform
i
pass
along
nonchalantly
insinuating
myself
into
movements
impalpable
charm
of
back
streets
in
which
i
find
myself
cool
spaces
filled
with
shadow
white
hammocks
in
the
sunlight
bulging
outcrush
into
old
tumult
attainment
as
of
a
narrow
harbour
of
some
shop
forgotten
by
traffic
with
walls
black
shapes
bending
taxicabs
crush
in
the
crowd
the
tops
are
each
a
shining
square
shuttles
that
steadily
press
through
woolly
fabric
drooping
blossom
over
spray
out
jingling
tumult
of
rays
monotonous
domes
of
vibrate
in
the
heat
silently
easily
we
sway
through
braying
traffic
down
the
crowded
street
the
tumult
crouches
over
us
or
suddenly
drifts
to
one
side
transposition
i
am
blown
like
a
leaf
hither
and
thither
the
city
about
me
resolves
itself
into
sound
of
many
voices
rustling
and
fluttering
leaves
shaken
by
the
breeze
a
million
forces
ignore
me
i
know
not
why
i
am
drunken
with
it
all
suddenly
i
feel
an
immense
will
stored
up
hitherto
and
unconscious
till
this
instant
projecting
my
body
across
a
street
in
the
face
of
all
its
traffic
i
dart
and
dash
i
do
not
know
why
i
go
these
people
watch
me
i
yield
them
my
adventure
lazily
i
lounge
through
labyrinthine
corridors
and
with
eyes
suddenly
altered
i
peer
into
an
office
i
do
not
know
and
wonder
at
a
startled
face
that
penetrates
my
own
roses
pavement
i
will
take
all
this
city
away
with
me
people
uproar
the
pavement
jostling
and
flickering
women
with
incredible
eyelids
dandies
in
spats
throng
discussing
me
i
know
them
all
i
will
take
them
away
with
me
i
insistently
rob
them
of
their
essence
i
must
have
it
all
before
night
to
sing
amid
my
green
i
glide
out
unobservant
in
the
midst
of
the
traffic
blown
like
a
leaf
hither
and
thither
till
the
city
resolves
itself
into
a
clamour
of
voices
crying
hollowly
like
the
wind
rustling
through
the
forest
against
the
frozen
housefronts
lost
in
the
glitter
of
a
million
movements
peripeteia
i
can
no
longer
find
a
place
for
myself
i
go
there
are
too
many
things
to
detain
me
but
the
force
behind
is
reckless
noise
uproar
movement
slide
me
outwards
black
sleet
shivering
down
red
walls
in
thick
jungles
of
green
this
gyration
my
centrifugal
folly
through
roaring
dust
and
futility
spattered
will
find
its
own
repose
golden
lights
will
gleam
out
sullenly
into
silence
before
i
return
we
rush
a
black
throng
straight
upon
darkness
motes
scattered
by
the
arc
rays
over
the
bridge
fluttering
it
is
no
one
heeds
lost
amid
greenness
we
will
sleep
all
night
and
in
the
morning
coming
forth
we
will
shake
wet
wings
over
the
settled
dust
of
the
city
hurls
its
cobbled
streets
after
us
to
drive
us
faster
we
must
attain
the
night
before
endless
processions
of
lamps
push
us
back
a
clock
with
quivering
hands
leaps
to
the
of
our
departure
we
leave
behind
pale
traces
of
achievement
fires
that
we
kindled
but
were
too
tired
to
put
out
broad
gold
fans
brushing
softly
over
dark
walls
stifled
uproar
of
night
we
are
already
cast
forth
the
signal
of
our
departure
jerks
down
before
we
have
learned
we
are
to
go
station
we
descend
into
a
wall
of
green
straggling
shapes
afterwards
none
are
seen
i
find
myself
alone
i
look
back
the
city
has
grown
one
grey
wall
windowed
unlit
heavily
night
crushes
the
face
of
it
i
go
on
my
memories
freeze
like
birds
cry
in
hollow
trees
i
go
on
up
and
outright
to
the
hostility
of
night
flint
flint
trees
elm
trees
and
the
leaf
the
boy
in
me
hated
long
ago
rough
and
sandy
poplars
and
their
leaves
tender
smooth
to
the
fingers
and
a
secret
in
their
smell
i
have
forgotten
oaks
and
forest
glades
heart
aching
with
wonder
fear
their
bitter
mast
willows
and
the
scented
beetle
we
put
in
our
handkerchiefs
and
the
roots
of
one
that
spread
into
a
river
nakedness
water
and
joy
hawthorn
white
and
odorous
with
blossom
framing
the
quiet
fields
and
swaying
flowers
and
grasses
and
the
hum
of
bees
oh
these
are
the
things
that
are
with
me
now
in
the
town
and
i
am
grateful
for
this
minute
of
my
manhood
lunch
frail
beauty
green
gold
and
incandescent
whiteness
narcissi
daffodils
you
have
brought
me
spring
and
longing
wistfulness
in
your
irradiance
therefore
i
sit
here
among
the
people
dreaming
and
my
heart
aches
with
all
the
hawthorn
blossom
the
bees
humming
the
light
wind
upon
the
poplars
and
your
warmth
and
your
love
and
your
eyes
they
smile
and
know
me
malady
i
move
perhaps
i
have
wakened
this
is
a
bed
this
is
a
room
and
there
is
light
darkness
have
i
performed
the
dozen
acts
or
so
that
make
me
the
man
men
see
the
door
opens
and
on
the
landing
quiet
i
can
see
nothing
the
pain
the
weariness
stairs
banisters
a
handrail
all
indistinguishable
one
step
farther
down
or
up
and
why
but
up
is
harder
down
down
to
this
white
blur
it
gives
before
me
me
i
extend
all
ways
i
fit
into
the
walls
and
they
pull
me
light
light
i
know
it
is
light
stillness
and
then
something
moves
green
oh
green
dazzling
lightning
and
joy
this
is
my
room
there
are
my
books
there
the
piano
there
the
last
bar
i
wrote
there
the
last
line
and
oh
the
sunlight
a
parrot
screeches
accident
dear
one
you
sit
there
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
and
you
do
not
know
me
and
your
eyes
forbid
is
it
the
dirt
the
squalor
the
wear
of
human
bodies
and
the
dead
faces
of
our
neighbours
these
are
but
symbols
you
are
proud
i
praise
you
your
mouth
is
set
you
see
beyond
us
and
you
see
nothing
i
have
the
vision
of
your
calm
cold
face
and
of
the
black
hair
that
waves
above
it
i
watch
you
i
love
you
i
desire
you
there
is
a
quiet
here
within
the
of
the
wheels
upon
the
railway
there
is
a
quiet
here
within
my
heart
but
tense
and
tender
this
is
my
station
fragment
that
night
i
loved
you
in
the
candlelight
your
golden
hair
strewed
the
sweet
whiteness
of
the
pillows
and
the
counterpane
o
the
darkness
of
the
corners
the
warm
air
and
the
stars
framed
in
the
casement
of
the
ships
lights
the
waves
lapped
into
the
harbour
the
boats
creaked
a
man
voice
sang
out
on
the
quay
and
you
loved
me
in
your
love
were
the
tall
tree
fuchsias
the
blue
of
the
hortensias
the
scarlet
nasturtiums
the
trees
on
the
hills
the
roads
we
had
covered
and
the
sea
that
had
borne
your
body
before
the
rocks
of
hartland
you
loved
me
with
these
and
with
the
kindness
of
people
country
folk
sailors
and
fishermen
and
the
old
lady
who
had
lodged
us
and
supped
us
you
loved
me
with
yourself
that
was
these
and
more
changed
as
the
earth
is
changed
into
the
bloom
of
flowers
houses
evening
and
quiet
a
bird
trills
in
the
poplar
trees
behind
the
house
with
the
dark
green
door
across
the
road
into
the
sky
the
red
earthenware
and
the
galvanised
iron
chimneys
thrust
their
cowls
the
hoot
of
the
steamers
on
the
thames
is
plain
no
wind
the
trees
merge
green
with
green
a
car
whirs
by
footsteps
and
voices
take
their
pitch
in
the
key
of
dusk
and
near
subdued
solid
and
square
to
the
world
the
houses
stand
their
windows
blocked
with
venetian
blinds
nothing
will
move
them
on
black
bare
trees
a
stale
cream
moon
hangs
dead
and
sours
the
unborn
buds
two
gaunt
old
hacks
knees
bent
heads
low
tug
tired
and
spent
an
old
horse
tram
damp
smoke
rank
mist
fill
the
dark
square
and
round
the
bend
six
bullocks
come
a
hobbling
drover
guides
their
clattering
feet
to
death
and
shame
lawrence
lawrence
ballad
of
another
ophelia
oh
the
green
glimmer
of
apples
in
the
orchard
lamps
in
a
wash
of
rain
oh
the
wet
walk
of
my
brown
hen
through
the
stackyard
oh
tears
on
the
window
pane
nothing
now
will
ripen
the
bright
green
apples
full
of
disappointment
and
of
rain
brackish
they
will
taste
of
tears
when
the
yellow
dapples
of
autumn
tell
the
withered
tale
again
all
round
the
yard
it
is
cluck
my
brown
hen
cluck
and
the
wings
cluck
my
marigold
bird
and
again
cluck
for
your
yellow
darlings
for
the
grey
rat
found
the
gold
thirteen
huddled
away
in
the
dark
flutter
for
a
moment
oh
the
beast
is
quick
and
keen
extinct
one
spark
once
i
had
a
lover
bright
like
running
water
once
his
face
was
laughing
like
the
sky
open
like
the
sky
looking
down
in
all
its
laughter
on
the
buttercups
and
buttercups
was
i
what
then
is
there
hidden
in
the
skirts
of
all
the
blossom
what
is
peeping
from
your
wings
oh
mother
hen
is
the
sun
who
asks
the
question
in
a
lovely
haste
for
wisdom
what
a
lovely
haste
for
wisdom
is
in
men
yea
but
it
is
cruel
when
undressed
is
all
the
blossom
and
her
shift
is
lying
white
upon
the
floor
that
a
grey
one
like
a
shadow
like
a
rat
a
thief
a
creeps
upon
her
then
and
gathers
in
his
store
oh
the
grey
garner
that
is
full
of
apples
oh
the
golden
sparkles
laid
extinct
and
oh
behind
the
cloud
sheaves
like
yellow
autumn
dapples
did
you
see
the
wicked
sun
that
winked
illicit
in
front
of
the
sombre
mountains
a
faint
lost
ribbon
of
rainbow
and
between
us
and
it
the
thunder
and
down
below
in
the
green
wheat
the
labourers
stand
like
dark
stumps
still
in
the
green
wheat
you
are
near
to
me
and
your
naked
feet
in
their
sandals
and
through
the
scent
of
the
balcony
naked
timber
i
distinguish
the
scent
of
your
hair
so
now
the
limber
lightning
falls
from
heaven
adown
the
floats
a
dark
boat
through
the
gloom
and
whither
the
thunder
roars
but
still
we
have
each
other
the
naked
lightnings
in
the
heaven
dither
and
disappear
what
have
we
but
each
other
the
boat
has
gone
fireflies
in
the
corn
woman
taunts
her
look
at
the
little
darlings
in
the
corn
the
rye
is
taller
than
you
who
think
yourself
so
high
and
mighty
look
how
its
heads
are
borne
dark
and
proud
in
the
sky
like
a
number
of
knights
passing
with
spears
and
pennants
and
manly
scorn
and
always
likely
oh
if
i
could
ride
with
my
head
held
against
the
sky
do
you
think
i
have
a
creature
like
you
at
my
side
with
your
gloom
and
your
doubt
that
you
love
me
o
darling
rye
how
i
adore
you
for
your
simple
pride
and
those
bright
fireflies
wafting
in
between
and
over
the
swaying
cornstalks
just
above
all
their
helmets
like
little
green
stars
come
low
and
wandering
here
for
love
of
this
dark
earth
and
wandering
all
serene
how
i
adore
you
you
happy
things
you
dears
riding
the
air
and
carrying
all
the
time
your
little
lanterns
behind
you
it
cheers
my
heart
to
see
you
settling
and
trying
to
climb
the
cornstalks
tipping
with
fire
their
spears
all
over
the
corn
dim
motion
against
the
blue
dark
sky
of
night
the
wandering
glitter
the
swarm
of
questing
brilliant
things
you
joy
you
true
spirit
of
careless
joy
ah
how
i
warm
my
poor
and
perished
soul
at
the
joy
of
you
man
answers
and
she
you
a
fool
woman
i
love
you
and
you
know
i
do
lord
take
his
love
away
it
makes
him
whine
and
i
give
you
everything
that
you
want
me
to
lord
dear
lord
do
you
think
he
ever
shine
a
woman
and
her
dead
husband
ah
stern
cold
man
how
can
you
lie
so
relentless
hard
while
i
wash
you
with
weeping
water
ah
face
carved
hard
and
cold
you
have
been
like
this
on
your
guard
against
me
since
death
began
you
masquerader
how
can
you
shame
to
act
this
part
of
unswerving
indifference
to
me
it
is
not
you
why
disguise
yourself
against
me
to
break
my
heart
you
evader
you
a
warm
mouth
a
good
warm
mouth
always
sooner
to
soften
even
than
your
sudden
eyes
ah
cruel
to
keep
your
mouth
relentless
however
often
i
kiss
it
in
drouth
you
are
not
he
who
are
you
lying
in
his
place
on
the
bed
and
rigid
and
indifferent
to
me
his
mouth
though
he
laughed
or
sulked
was
always
warm
and
red
and
good
to
me
and
his
eyes
could
see
the
white
moon
hang
like
a
breast
revealed
by
the
slipping
shawl
of
stars
could
see
the
small
stars
tremble
as
the
heart
beneath
did
wield
systole
diastole
and
he
showed
it
me
so
when
he
made
his
love
to
me
and
his
brows
like
rocks
on
the
sea
jut
out
and
his
eyes
were
deep
like
the
sea
with
shadow
and
he
looked
at
me
till
i
sank
in
him
like
the
sea
awfully
oh
he
was
multiform
which
then
was
he
among
the
manifold
the
gay
the
sorrowful
the
seer
i
have
loved
a
rich
race
of
men
in
one
but
not
this
this
ah
masquerader
with
your
steel
face
were
you
he
after
all
and
i
never
saw
you
or
felt
you
in
kissing
yet
sometimes
my
heart
was
trammelled
with
fear
evader
you
will
not
stir
nor
hear
me
not
a
sound
then
it
was
you
and
all
this
time
you
were
like
this
when
i
lived
with
you
it
is
not
true
i
am
frightened
i
am
frightened
of
you
and
of
everything
o
god
god
too
has
deceived
me
in
everything
in
everything
the
mowers
there
four
men
mowing
down
by
the
river
i
can
hear
the
sound
of
the
scythe
strokes
four
sharp
breaths
swishing
yea
but
i
am
sorry
for
what

scent
of
irises
a
faint
sickening
scent
of
irises
persists
all
morning
here
in
a
jar
on
the
table
a
fine
proud
spike
of
purple
irises
rising
above
the
litter
makes
me
unable
to
see
the
class
lifted
and
bended
faces
save
in
a
broken
pattern
amid
purple
and
gold
and
sable
i
can
smell
the
gorgeous
in
its
breathless
dazzle
of
when
the
marigold
glare
overcast
you
with
fire
on
your
brow
and
your
cheeks
and
your
chin
as
you
dipped
your
face
in
your
marigold
bunch
to
touch
and
contrast
your
own
dark
mouth
with
the
bridal
faint
dissolved
in
the
golden
sorcery
you
should
not
outlast
you
amid
the
yellow
incantation
you
sitting
in
the
cowslips
of
the
meadows
above
me
your
shadow
on
the
flowery
me
full
length
in
the
cowslips
muttering
you
love
you
your
soul
like
a
lost
evanescent
you
with
your
face
all
rich
like
the
sheen
on
a
dove
you
are
always
asking
do
i
remember
remember
the
buttercup
where
the
flowers
rose
up
and
kindled
you
over
deep
with
a
coat
of
gold
you
ask
again
do
the
healing
days
close
up
the
open
darkness
which
then
drew
us
in
the
dark
that
swallows
all
and
nought
throws
up
you
upon
the
dry
dead
in
the
fire
of
night
burnt
like
a
sacrifice
you
invisible
only
the
fire
of
darkness
and
the
scent
of
you
and
yes
thank
god
it
still
is
possible
the
healing
days
shall
close
the
darkness
up
wherein
i
breathed
you
like
a
smoke
or
dew
like
vapour
dew
or
poison
now
thank
god
the
golden
fire
has
gone
and
your
face
is
ash
indistinguishable
in
the
grey
chill
day
the
night
has
burnt
you
out
at
last
the
good
dark
fire
burns
on
untroubled
without
clash
of
you
upon
the
dead
leaves
saying
me
yea
green
the
sky
was
the
sky
was
green
wine
held
up
in
the
sun
the
moon
was
a
golden
petal
between
she
opened
her
eyes
and
green
they
shone
clear
like
flowers
undone
for
the
first
time
now
for
the
first
time
seen
amy
lowell
amy
lowell
venus
transiens
tell
me
was
venus
more
beautiful
than
you
are
when
she
topped
the
crinkled
waves
drifting
shoreward
on
her
plaited
shell
was
botticelli
vision
fairer
than
mine
and
were
the
painted
rosebuds
he
tossed
his
lady
of
better
worth
than
the
words
i
blow
about
you
to
cover
your
too
great
loveliness
as
with
a
gauze
of
misted
silver
for
me
you
stand
poised
in
the
blue
and
buoyant
air
cinctured
by
bright
winds
treading
the
sunlight
and
the
waves
which
precede
you
ripple
and
stir
the
sands
at
my
feet
the
travelling
bear
push
up
between
the
cobblestones
and
catch
the
sun
on
their
flat
sides
shooting
it
back
gold
and
emerald
into
the
eyes
of
and
over
the
cobblestones
and
heavy
dances
the
trained
bear
tho
cobbles
cut
his
feet
and
he
has
a
ring
in
his
nose
which
hurts
him
but
still
he
dances
for
the
keeper
pricks
him
with
a
sharp
stick
under
his
fur
now
the
crowd
gapes
and
chuckles
and
boys
and
young
women
shuffle
their
feet
in
time
to
the
dancing
bear
they
see
him
wobbling
against
a
dust
of
emerald
and
gold
and
they
are
greatly
delighted
the
legs
of
the
bear
shake
with
fatigue
and
his
back
aches
and
the
shining
dazzle
and
confuse
him
but
still
he
dances
because
of
the
little
pointed
stick
the
letter
little
cramped
words
scrawling
all
over
the
paper
like
draggled
fly
legs
what
can
you
tell
of
the
flaring
moon
through
the
oak
leaves
or
of
my
uncurtained
window
and
the
bare
floor
spattered
with
moonlight
your
silly
quirks
and
twists
have
nothing
in
them
of
blossoming
hawthorns
and
this
paper
is
dull
crisp
smooth
virgin
of
loveliness
beneath
my
hand
i
am
tired
beloved
of
chafing
my
heart
against
the
want
of
you
of
squeezing
it
into
little
inkdrops
and
posting
it
and
i
scald
alone
here
under
the
fire
of
the
great
moon
grotesque
why
do
the
lilies
goggle
their
tongues
at
me
when
i
pluck
them
and
writhe
and
twist
and
strangle
themselves
against
my
fingers
so
that
i
can
hardly
weave
the
garland
for
your
hair
why
do
they
shriek
your
name
and
spit
at
me
when
i
would
cluster
them
must
i
kill
them
to
make
them
lie
still
and
send
you
a
wreath
of
lolling
corpses
to
turn
putrid
and
soft
on
your
forehead
while
you
dance
bullion
my
thoughts
chink
against
my
ribs
and
roll
about
like
silver
i
should
like
to
spill
them
out
and
pour
them
all
shining
over
you
but
my
heart
is
shut
upon
them
and
holds
them
straitly
come
you
and
open
my
heart
that
my
thoughts
torment
me
no
longer
but
glitter
in
your
hair
solitaire
when
night
drifts
along
the
streets
of
the
city
and
sifts
down
between
the
uneven
roofs
my
mind
begins
to
peek
and
peer
it
plays
at
ball
in
old
blue
chinese
gardens
and
shakes
wrought
in
pagan
temples
amid
the
broken
flutings
of
white
pillars
it
dances
with
purple
and
yellow
crocuses
in
its
hair
and
its
feet
shine
as
they
flutter
over
drenched
grasses
how
light
and
laughing
my
mind
is
when
all
the
good
folk
have
put
out
their
candles
and
the
city
is
still
the
bombardment
slowly
without
force
the
rain
drops
into
the
city
it
stops
a
moment
on
the
carved
head
of
saint
john
then
slides
on
again
slipping
and
trickling
over
his
stone
cloak
it
splashes
from
the
lead
conduit
of
a
gargoyle
and
falls
from
it
in
turmoil
on
the
stones
in
the
cathedral
square
where
are
the
people

why
does
the
fretted
steeple

about

the

rubies
leap
in

torture
this

the

breaks

it
rustles
at

itself
up
