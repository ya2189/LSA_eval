was
a
phantom
in
lone
thickets
lies
couched
the
lordly
stag
the
dreaming
tail
forgets
its
customary
wag
and
plodding
weary
steps
insensibly
grow
quicker
as
broadening
casements
light
them
on
towards
home
or
liquor
it
is
in
fact
the
pure
and
pleasant
time
when
stars
break
into
splendour
and
poets
into
rhyme
when
in
the
glass
of
memory
the
forms
of
loved
ones
and
when
of
course
miss
is
prominent
in
mine
miss
goodchild
goodchild
graciously
you
smiled
upon
my
childish
passion
once
yourself
a
child
when
i
was
no
doubt
profiting
by
instruction
and
sent
those
streaky
lollipops
home
for
your
fairy
suction
her
natural
the
night
when
first
we
her
golden
hair
was
gleaming
the
coercive
net
brow
was
like
the
snawdrift
her
step
was
like
queen
and
gone
was
instantly
the
heart
of
every
boy
at
the
chasséed
her
on
graceful
limb
the
onyx
decked
his
her
smiles
were
not
for
him
with
she
drowsily
her
eyes
to
blink
and
brought
raisin
wine
and
said
pretty
creature
drink
and
evermore
when
winter
comes
in
his
garb
of
snows
and
the
returning
schoolboy
is
told
how
fast
he
grows
shall
that
soft
hand
in
ideal
lancers
and
dream
i
hear
demure
remarks
and
make
impassioned
answers
i
know
that
never
never
may
her
love
for
me
at
night
i
muse
upon
the
fact
with
undisguised
but
ever
shall
i
bless
that
day
i
bless
as
a
rule
the
days
i
spent
at
preparatory
and
two
meet
be
still
my
throbbing
heart
now
rolling
years
have
weaned
us
from
jam
and
raspberry
tart
one
night
i
saw
a
when
bloom
i
a
rug
in
a
sumptuous
one
hand
clasped
easily
reposed
upon
my
and
ye
burst
abruptly
from
lip
i
raised
my
brimming
eye
and
saw
in
hers
an
answering
my
heart
beat
i
woke
and
lo
it
was
a
dream
gemini
and
virgo
some
vast
amount
of
years
ago
ere
all
my
youth
had
vanished
from
me
a
boy
it
was
my
lot
to
know
whom
his
familiar
friends
called
tommy
i
love
to
gaze
upon
a
child
a
young
bud
bursting
into
blossom
artless
as
eve
yet
unbeguiled
and
agile
as
a
young
opossum
and
such
was
he
a
lad
yet
mad
at
moments
as
a
hatter
why
hatters
as
a
race
are
mad
i
never
knew
nor
does
it
matter
he
was
what
nurses
call
a
one
of
those
small
misguided
creatures
who
though
their
intellects
are
dim
are
one
too
many
for
their
teachers
and
if
you
asked
of
him
to
say
what
twice
was
or
times
glance
in
quite
a
placid
way
from
heaven
to
earth
from
earth
to
heaven
and
smile
and
look
politely
round
to
catch
a
casual
suggestion
but
make
no
effort
to
propound
any
solution
of
the
question
and
so
not
much
esteemed
was
he
of
the
authorities
and
therefore
he
fraternized
by
chance
with
me
needing
a
somebody
to
care
for
and
three
fair
summers
did
we
twain
live
as
they
say
and
love
together
and
bore
by
turns
the
wholesome
cane
till
our
young
skins
became
as
leather
and
carved
our
names
on
every
desk
and
tore
our
clothes
and
inked
our
collars
and
looked
unique
and
picturesque
but
not
it
may
be
model
scholars
we
did
much
as
we
chose
to
do
never
heard
of
grundy
all
the
theology
we
knew
was
that
we
play
on
sunday
and
all
the
general
truths
that
cakes
were
to
be
bought
at
four
and
that
excruciating
aches
resulted
if
we
ate
too
many
and
seeing
ignorance
is
bliss
and
wisdom
consequently
folly
the
obvious
result
is
that
our
two
lives
were
very
jolly
at
last
the
separation
came
real
love
at
that
time
was
the
fashion
and
by
a
horrid
chance
the
same
young
thing
was
to
us
both
a
passion
old
poser
snorted
like
a
horse
his
feet
were
large
his
hands
were
pimply
his
manner
when
excited
coarse
but
miss
was
an
angel
simply
she
was
a
blushing
gushing
thing
than
fancy
painted
she
helped
me
to
a
wing
of
thought
i
should
have
fainted
the
people
said
that
she
was
blue
but
i
was
green
and
loved
her
dearly
she
was
approaching
and
i
was
then
eleven
nearly
i
did
not
love
as
others
do
none
ever
did
that
heard
tell
of
my
passion
was
a
byword
through
the
town
she
was
of
course
the
belle
of
oh
to
the
toilworn
man
the
sound
of
rippling
river
as
to
cadets
in
hindostan
the
fleeting
remnant
of
their
to
me
was
anna
dear
as
gold
that
fills
the
sunless
coffers
as
to
the
spinster
growing
old
the
she
had
offers
sent
her
little
gifts
of
fruit
written
lines
to
her
as
venus
sworn
unflinchingly
to
shoot
the
man
who
dared
to
come
between
us
and
it
was
you
my
thomas
you
the
friend
in
whom
my
soul
confided
who
dared
to
gaze
on
do
i
may
say
much
the
same
as
i
did
one
night
i
him
squeeze
her
hand
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
matter
i
said
he
must
resign
or
stand
my
he
chose
the
latter
we
met
we
blows
on
blows
we
fought
as
long
as
we
were
able
my
rival
had
a
and
both
my
speaking
eyes
were
sable
when
the
cut
short
our
strife
miss
gave
both
of
us
a
plaster
and
in
a
week
became
the
wife
of
horace
nibbs
the
i
loved
her
love
her
still
only
one
must
not
love
but
thou
and
i
my
tommy
will
when
we
again
meet
meet
as
brothers
it
may
be
that
in
age
one
seeks
peace
only
that
the
blood
is
brisker
in
veins
than
in
theirs
whose
cheeks
are
partially
obscured
by
whisker
or
that
the
growing
ages
steal
the
memories
of
past
wrongs
from
us
but
this
is
i
feel
most
friendly
unto
thee
oh
thomas
and
we
meet
again
on
this
or
that
side
the
equator
if
not
turned
teetotaller
then
and
have
wherewith
to
pay
the
waiter
to
thee
drain
the
modest
cup
ignite
with
thee
the
mild
havannah
and
we
will
waft
while
liquoring
up
forgiveness
to
the
heartless
anna
stands
a
ingoldsby
year
by
year
do
daughters
in
the
sweetest
gloves
and
shawls

to

waters

balls
non

could
not

more
favoured
spot

no

may
shiver
all

on

side

looks
on

vale
and
plain
and
on
fair
hills
faint
and
fainter
outlined
as
they
near
the
main
there
i
met
with
him
my
chosen
but
not
swell
faultless
in
his
hats
and
hosen
whom
the
johnian
lawns
know
well
oh
my
comrade
ever
valued
still
i
see
your
festive
face
hear
you
humming
of
gal
left
in
massive
bass
see
you
sit
with
that
composure
on
the
eeliest
of
hacks
that
the
novice
would
suppose
your
manly
limbs
encased
in
wax

i
say
to
you
that
cheerless

my
days
be
till

my
side
she
mashed
the
fragrant
strawberry
lashes
soft
as

drooped
saddened
eyes
when
vagrant
gnats
sought
watery
graves
in

then
we
danced

as

on
the
roses
the
owl
hath
spread
her
wing
and
vocal
are
the
noses
of
peasant
and
of
king
in
short
but
i
do
no
such
thing
pent
in
my
lonesome
study
here
i
must
sit
and
muse
sit
till
the
morn
grows
ruddy
till
rising
with
the
dews
remove
the
muddy
spots
from
their
shoes
yet
are
sweet
faces
flinging
their
witchery
me
here
i
hear
sweet
voices
singing
a
song
as
soft
as
clear
as
previously
to
stinging
a
gnat
sings
round
ear
does
grace
draw
young
apollos
in

mustachios
still
does
emma
tell
the
swallows
how
she
will
pipe
and
trill

some
fine
day
she
follows
those
birds
to
the
and

albert
faded
from

yet
albert
whose
was
shaded
by
locks
of
glossiest
jet
whom
almost
any
have
given
her
eyes
to
get
does
not
her
conscience
smite
her
for
one
who
hourly
pines
thinking
her
bright
eyes
brighter
than
any
star
that

mean
of
course

these
pathetic
lines

knows

his
ceaseless
course

resource
invest

a
halter

perish

lines
suggested
by
the
fourteenth
of
february
ere
the
morn
the
east
has
crimsoned
when
the
stars
are
twinkling
there
as
they
did
in
hymns
and
made
him
wonder
what
they
were
when
the
are
beading
fern

flower
with
silvery
my
infallible
proceeding
is
to
wake
and
think
of
you
when
the
ringing
bugle
sounds
farewell
to

frugal
meal

gray
remarks

doth
to

complain

than
are
dreamed
of
in

doubt
the

of

not
generally
could
tell

lurking
fear
is
that
the
great
gammer
ken

yet
feel
i
owe
apology
for
passing
in
this
way
to
scottish
phraseology
alas
dear
madam
i
must
ask
your
pardon
for
making
this
unwarranted
digression
starting
i
think
from
mistress
garden
and
beg
to
send
with
every
expression
of
personal
esteem
a
book
of
rhymes
for
master
to
read
at
miscellaneous
times
there
is

youth
who
keeps
a
horn
living
next
me
upon
the
selfsame

the
midnight

morn

laurie
the
tune
is
good
the
habit
romantic
but
tending
if
pursued
to
drive
neighbours
frantic
and
now
this
unprecedented
hour
when
the
young
dawn
is
out
the
stars
i
hear
that
more
than
usual
power
and
with
the
first
few
bars
and
i
do
think
the
amateur
cornopean
should
be
put
down
by
perhaps
utopian
who
knows
what
i
might
have
forth
if
not
checked
by
that
absurd
but
i
know
that
when
my
friend
has
plodded
through
the
first
verse
the
second
will
ensue
considering
which
dear
madam
i
will
merely
send
the
aforesaid
am
yours
most
sincerely
a
distant
of
making
a
fortune
now
the
morn
floods
with
light
the
dazzled
heaven
and
the
schoolboy
groans
on
hearing
that
eternal
clock
strike
seven
now
the
waggoner
is
driving
towards
the
fields
his
clattering
wain
now
the
bluebottle
reviving
buzzes
down
his
native
pane
but
to
me
the
morn
is
hateful
wearily
i
stretch
my
legs
dress
and
settle
to
my
plateful
of
perhaps
inferior
eggs
yesterday
miss
crump
by
message
mentioned
which
pay
and
i
have
a
dismal
presage
that
call
herself
once
i
breakfasted
off
rosewood
smoked
through
then
how
my
patrician
nose
would
turn
up
at
the
thought
of
ale
claret
graced
my
luncheon
then
now
i
drink
porter
in
a
garret
to
be
paid
for
heaven
knows
how
when
the
evening
shades
are
deepened
and
i
doff
my
hat
and
gloves
no
sweet
bird
is
there
to
and
twitter
twenty
million
loves
no
canaries
sing
to
me
of
foam
no
imaginary
call
fictitious
araminta
sweetest
fairest
solace
once
of
every
ill
how
i
wonder
if
thou
bearest
mivins
in
remembrance
still
if
that
friday
night
is
banished
yet
from
that
retentive
mind
when
the
others
somehow
vanished
and
we
two
were
left
behind
when
in
accents
low
yet
thrilling
i
did
all
my
love
declare
mentioned
that
not
a
hinted
that
we
need
not
care
and
complacently
you
listened
to
my
somewhat
long
listening
at
the
same
time
quite
the
same
as
saying
yes
once
a
happy
child
i
carolled
green
lawns
the
whole
day
through
not
unpleasingly
apparelled
in
a
tightish
suit
of
blue
what
a
change
has
now
passed
me
now
with
what
dismay
i
see
every
rising
morn
before
me
goodness
gracious
patience
me
and
prowl
a
moodier
lara
through
the
world
as
prowls
the
bat
and
habitually
wear
a
cypress
wreath
around
my
hat
and
when
death
snuffs
out
the
taper
of
my
life
as
soon
he
must
send
up
to
every
paper
mivins
of
isabel
now
the
landscape
crowd
the
deepening
shades
and
the
shut
lily
cradles
not
the
bee
the
red
deer
couches
in
the
forest
glades
and
faint
the
echoes
of
the
slumberous
sea
and
ere
i
rest
one
prayer
breathe
for
thee
the
sweet
egeria
of
my
lonely
dreams
lady
forgive
that
ever
upon
me
thoughts
of
thee
linger
as
the
soft
starbeams
linger
on
rock
or
dark
streams
on
gray
pilatus
once
we
loved
to
stray
and
watch
far
off
the
glimmering
roselight
break
the
dim
ere
yet
one
ray
pierced
the
deep
bosom
of
the
lake
oh
who
felt
not
new
life
within
him
wake
and
his
pulse
quicken
and
his
spirit
save
one
we
wot
of
whom
the
cold
make
feel
pains
in
every
joint
in
turn
when
first
he
saw
the
sun
gild
thy
green
shores
lucerne
and
years
have
past
and
i
have
gazed
once
more
on
blue
lakes
glistening
beneath
mountains

and
all
seemed
sadder
lovelier
than
for
all
awakened
memories
of
you
oh
had
i
had
you
by
my
side
in
lieu
of
that
red
matron
whom
the
flies
would
worry
flies
in
those
parts
unfortunately
do
who
walked
so
slowly

in
such
a

with
such
wild
contempt
for

the

an

in

a

each
perambulating
infant

a
magic
in
its
squall
for
my
eager

detected
senior
wranglers
in

degrees

grew
and
i
became
as
others
learned
to
court
delirium
tremens
by
the
aid
of
bacon
brothers
bought
me
tiny
boots
of

or
more

that

down
upon

i

on

indifferent
to
blisters

the
buttress
of
the
period

wherefore
bless
ye
o

unto
mine

must
i
your
moralist
betake
me
in
my
beer
in
those
old
days
which
poets
say
were
perhaps
they
laid
the
gilding
on
themselves
and
if
they
did
all
the
more
beholden
to
those
brown
dwellers
in
my
dusty
shelves
who
talk
to
me
language
quaint
and
of
gods
and
demigods
and
fauns
and
elves
pans
with
his
pipes
and
bacchus
with
his
leopards
and
staid
young
goddesses
who
flirt
with
shepherds
in
those
old
days
the
nymph
called
etiquette
appalling
thought
to
dwell
on
was
not
born
they
had
their
may
but
no
mayfair
as
yet
no
fashions
varying
as
the
hues
of
morn
just
as
they
pleased
they
dressed
and
drank
and
ate
sang
hymns
to
ceres
their
john
barleycorn
and
danced
unchaperoned
and
laughed
unchecked
and
were
no
doubt
extremely
incorrect
yet
do
i
think
their
theory
was
pleasant
and
oft
i
own
my
fancy
back
to
those
times
so
different
from
the
present
when
no
one
smoked
cigars
nor
gave
nor
smote
a
nor
winged
a
pheasant
nor
their
hair
by
means
of
combs
nor
migrated

brighton
once
astonishing
of
beer
no
they
did
not
drink
beer
brings
me
as
gilpin
said
middle
of
my
not
that
is
precisely
true
or
else
i
should
not
tax
your
patience
long
if
i
had
said
it
might
do
but
i
have
a
dislike
to
quoting
wrong
i
was
against
not
when
cowper
wrote
down
for
so
to
proceed
that
abstinence
from
malt
has
always
struck
me
as
extremely
curious
the
greek
mind
must
have
had
some
vital
fault
that
they
should
stick
to
liquors
so
wine
water
tempered
with
attic
salt
and
not
at
once
invent
that
mild
luxurious
and
artful
beverage
beer
how
the
digestion
got
on
without
it
is
a
startling
question
had
they
digestions
and
an
actual
body
such
as
dyspepsia
might
make
attacks
on
were
they
abstract
like
tom
noddy
and
briggs
men
like
jones
and
jackson
then
that
beer
or
some
say
the
gaelic
mixture
the
saxon
i
think
a
strict
adherence
to
the
latter
might
make
some
scots
less
pigheaded
and
fatter
besides
bon
gaultier
definitely
shews
that
the
real
beverage
for
feasting
gods
on
is
a
soft
compound
grateful
to
the
nose
and
also
to
the
palate
known
as
i
know
a
rose
to
be
a
peer
and
this
i
would
lay
odds
on
though
in
his
memoirs
it
may
not
appear
that
that
man
owed
his
rise
to
copious
beer
o
beer
o
hodgson
guinness
allsop
bass
names
that
should
be
on
every
tongue
shall
days

months
and
years
and
centuries
pass
and
still
your
merits
be
unrecked
unsung
oh
i
have
gazed
into
my
foaming
glass
and
wished
that
lyre
could
yet
again
be
strung
which
once
rang
through
greece
and
taught
her
misguided
sons
that
best
drink
was
how
would

now
recant
that
wild
opinion
and
would
that
i
could

alas
the

he
we
know

strives
with

is
that
entertains
the
view
of
emulating
pindar
and
will
be

to
some
now
nameless

when
the
green
slopes
of
arcadia
burned
with
all
the
lustre
of
the
dying
day
and
on
brow
the

turned
humming
of

in
his
delightful
way
how
lycidas
was
dead
and
how
concerned
the
nymphs
were
when
they
saw
his
lifeless
clay

how
rock
told

rock
the
dreadful
story
that
poor
young
lycidas
was
gone
to
glory
what
would
that
lone
and
labouring
soul
have
given
at
that
soft
moment
for
a
pewter
pot
how
had
the
mists
that
dimmed
his
eye
been
riven
and
lycidas
and
sorrow
all
forgot

upon
a

the
bench
is
short
but
i
am
shorter
place
my
head
the
which
i
have
stowed
my
little
all
in
and
sleep
though
moist
about
the
back
serenely
in
an
old
tarpaulin
bed
at
ostend
at
breakfast
at
and
train
tickets
to
königswinter
mem
the
seats
objectionably
dirty
and
onward
through
those
dreary
flats
we
move
with
scanty
space
to
sit
on
flanked
by
stout
girls
with
steeple
hats
and
waists
that
paralyse
a
briton
by
many
a
tidy
little
town
where
tidy
little
fraus
sit
knitting
the
pursuits
are
lying
down
smoking
perennial
pipes
and
spitting
and
doze
and
execrate
the
heat
and
wonder
how
far
off
cologne
is
and
if
we
shall
get
aught
to
eat
till
we
get
there
save
raw
polonies
until
at
last
the
old
is
seen
is
past
and
three
hours
later
ordering
steaks
and
talking
vile
to
an
austrian
waiter
königswinter
hateful
königswinter
of
all
i
loved
so
well
never
did
the
most
extensive
printer
print
a
tale
so
dark
as
thou
tell
in
the
sapphire
west
the
eve
yet
lingered
bathed
in
kindly
light
those
cold
fringed
each
cloud
and
stooping
changed
waters
into
molten
gold
while
still
nearer
did
his
light
waves
splinter
into
silvery
shafts
the
streaming
light
and
i
said
i
loved
thee
königswinter
for
the
glory
that
was
thine
that
night
and
we
gazed
till
slowly
disappearing
like
a
passed
the
pageant
by
and
i
saw
but
those
lone
hills
uprearing
dull
dark
shapes
against
a
hueless
sky
then
i
turned
and
on
those
bright
hopes
pondered
whereof
yon
gay
fancies
were
the
type
and
my
hand
mechanically
wandered
towards
my
pocket
for
a
pipe
ah
why
starts
each
eyeball
from
its
socket
as
in
hamlet
start
the
guilty
there
in
its
accustomed
pocket
lay
my
sole
pipe
smashed
to
smithereens
on
on
the
vessel
steals
round
go
the
and
now
the
tourist
feels
as
he
should
for
rolls
the
rhine
and
the
divine
and
the
victuals
and
the
wine
rather
good
from
every
crag
we
rise
up
some
hoar
old
castle
the
hanging
tassel
every
slope
and
the
vine
her
lithe
arms
stretches
peasants
singing
and
make
no
end
of
sketches
i
should
hope
a
nun
here
called
therèse
two
couriers
out
of
place
one
yankee
with
a
face
like
a
and
three
youths
in
scarlet
caps
drinking
chocolate
and
a
diet
which
perhaps
has
its
merits
and
day
again
declines
in
shadow
sleep
the
vines
and
the
last
ray
through
the
pines
feebly
glows
then
sinks
behind
yon
ridge
and
the
usual
evening
midge
is
settling
on
the
bridge
of
my
nose
and
the
air
and
cold
and
the
sheep
are
in
the
fold
and
night
walks
through
the
trees
and
on
the
silent
river
the
floating
starbeams
quiver
and
now
the
saints
deliver
us
from
fleas
avenues
of
broad
white
houses
basking
in
the
noontide
glare
streets
which
foot
of
traveller
shrinks
from
as
on
hot
plates
shrinks
the
bear
elsewhere
lawns
and
gardens
statues
white
and
cool
arcades
where
at

the
german
warrior
winks
upon
the
german
maids
such
is
munich
and
stately
rich
of
hue
and
fair
of

towards
the
end
of

unequivocally
there
the
long
dim
galleries
threading
may
the
eye
behold
breathing
from
the
records
of
the
years
of
old
pallas
there
and
jove
and
juno
once
more
walks
abroad
under
fiery
woodlands
and
the
saffron
skies
of
claude
there
the
amazons
of
rubens
lift
the
failing
arm
to
strike
and
the
pale
light
falls
in
masses
on
the
horsemen
of
vandyke
and
in
pools
reflected
hang
the
graceful
shapes
and
soft
laugh
amid
the
seville
grapes
and
all
purest
loveliest
fancies
that
in
souls
may
dwell
started
into
shape
and
substance
at
the
touch
of
lo
her
wan
arms
folded
meekly
and
the
glory
of
her
hair
falling
as
a
robe
around
her
kneels
the
magdalene
in
prayer
and
the
smiles
as
centuries
back
she
smiled
half
in
gladness
half
in
wonder
on
the
calm
face
of
her
child
and
that
mighty
tells
how
man
essayed
to
climb
up
the
ladder
of
the
ages
past
the
of
time
heard
the
rolling
through
the
sky
and
the
still
voice
bid
this
mortal
put
on
immortality
thence
we
turned
what
time
the
blackbird
pipes
to
vespers
from
his
perch
and
from
out
the
clattering
city
into
the
silent
church
marked
the
shower
of
sunlight
breaking
the
crimson
panes
and
on
pictured
wall
and
window
read
the
histories
of
the
dead
till
the
kneelers
round
us
rising
their
foreheads
and
were
gone

the
night
came
on
charades
i
she
stood
at
greenwich
motionless
amid
the
crowd
of
passengers
i
marked
a
big
tear
quivering
on
the
lid
of
her
eye
and
knew
that
hers
were
days
of
bitterness
but
what
i
said
storm
within
so
fair
a
breast
even
as
i
spoke
two
apoplectic
curs
came
feebly
up
with
one
wild
cry
she
prest
each
singly
to
her
heart
and
faltered
be
blest
yet
once
again
i
saw
her
from
the
deck
of
a
black
ship
that
steamed
towards
blackwall
she
walked
upon
her
stately
neck
bent
an
object
shrouded
in
her
shawl

there
in
accents

young

is

where
it
is
i
have
read
in
some
not
marvellous
tale
or
if
i
have
not
dreamed
of
one
who
filled
up
the
convivial
cup
till
the
company
round
him
seemed
to
be
vanished
and
gone
the
lamps
upon
their
face
as
aforetime
gleamed
and
his
head
sunk
down
and
a
lethe
crept
his
powerful
brain
and
the
young
man
slept
then
they
laid
him
with
care
in
his
moonlit
bed
but
thoughtfully
fetched
some
adorned
him
with
feathers
aware
that
the
uncertainty
brings
on
at
nights
catarrh

staid
in
his
room

the
sun
was
high

still
did
the
feathered
one
give
no

opening

woke
and
with
profound
bewilderment
he
gazed
around
dropped
one

both
feet
to
the

never
spake
a

to

made
his

and
a
lord
shall
pluck
it
at
the
last
of
propriety
study
first
propriety
for
she
is
indeed
the
polestar
which
shall
guide
the
artless
maiden
through
the
mazes
of
vanity
fair
nay
she
is
the
golden
chain
which
holdeth
together
society
the
lamp
by
whose
light
young
psyche
shall
approach
unblamed
her
eros
verily
truth
is
as
eve
which
was
ashamed
being
naked
wherefore
doth
propriety
dress
her
with
the
fair
foliage
of
artifice
and
when
she
is
drest
behold
she
knoweth
not
herself
i
walked
in
the
forest
and
above
me
stood
the
yew
stood
like
a
slumbering
giant
shrouded
in
impenetrable
shade
then
i
into
the
garden
and
marked
a
tree
clipt
into
shape
the
locks
had
been
shorn
by
the
dalilahshears
of
decorum
and
i
said
nature
is
goodly
but
how
much
goodlier
is
art
i
heard
the
wild
notes
of
the
lark
floating
far
over
the
blue
sky
and
my
foolish
heart
went
after
him
and
lo
i
blessed
him
as
he
rose
foolish
for
far
better
is
the
trained
boudoir
bulfinch
which
pipeth
the
semblance
of
a
tune
and
mechanically
draweth
up
water
and
the
reinless
steed
of
the
desert
though
his
neck
be
clothed
with
thunder
must
yield
to
him
that
danceth
and
in
the
at
for
verily
o
my
daughter
the
world
is
a
masquerade
and
god
made
thee
one
thing
that
thou
mightest
make
thyself
another
a
heart
is
as
champagne
ever
aspiring
and
struggling
upwards
and
it
needeth
that
its
motions
be
checked
by
the
silvered
cork
of
propriety
he
that
can
afford
the
price
his
be
the
precious
treasure
let
him
drink
deeply
of
its
sweetness
nor
grumble
if
it
tasteth
of
the
cork
of
friendship
choose
judiciously
thy
friends
for
to
discard
them
is
undesirable
yet
it
is
better
to
drop
thy
friends
o
my
daughter
than
to
drop
thy
dost
thou
know
a
wise
woman
yea
wiser
than
the
children
of
light
hath
she
a
position
and
a
title
and
are
her
parties
in
the
morning
post
if
thou
dost
cleave
unto
her
and
give
up
unto
her
thy
body
and
mind
think
with
her
ideas
and
distribute
thy
smiles
at
her
bidding
so
shalt
thou
become
like
unto
her
and
thy
manners
shall
be
and
thy
name
shall
be
a
sesame
at
which
the
doors
of
the
great
shall
fly
open
thou
shalt
know
every
peer
his
arms
and
the
date
of
his
creation
his
pedigree
and
their
intermarriages
and
cousins
to
the
sixth
remove
thou
shalt
kiss
the
hand
of
royalty
and
lo
in
next
papers
side
by
side
with
rumours
of
wars
and
stories
of
shipwrecks
and
sieges
shall
appear
thy
name
and
the
minutiæ
of
thy
and
petticoat
for
an
enraptured
public
to
muse
upon
over
their
matutinal
muffin
of
reading
read
not
milton
for
he
is
dry
nor
shakespeare
for
he
wrote
of
common
life
nor
scott
for
his
romances
though
fascinating
are
yet
intelligible
nor
thackeray
for
he
is
a
hogarth
a
photographer
who
flattereth
not
nor
kingsley
for
he
shall
teach
thee
that
thou
shouldest
not
dream
but
do
read
incessantly
thy
burke
that
burke
who
nobler
than
he
of
old

of
the

and

truly
sublime
and
beautiful
likewise

sigh
over
leonard
the

and

on
pelham
the

learn
how
is
the
of
existence
and
how
we
in
the
gadara
of
our
still
closets
the
beautiful
ghost
of
the
ideal
with
the
simple
wand
of
the
listen
how
maltravers
and
the
orphan
all
but
love
and
how
family
chaplain
and
unmade
kings
how
eugene
aram
though
a
thief
a
liar
and
a
murderer
yet
being
intellectual
was
amongst
the
noblest
of
mankind
so
shalt
thou
live
in
a
world
peopled
with
heroes
and
and
if
thou
canst
not
realise
the
ideal
thou
shalt
at
least
idealise
the
real
translations
lycidas
yet
once
more
o
ye
laurels
and
once
more
ye
myrtles
brown
with
ivy
never
sere
i
come
to
pluck
your
berries
harsh
and
crude
and
with
forced
fingers
rude
shatter
your
leaves
before
the
mellowing
year
bitter
constraint
and
sad
occasion
dear
compels
me
to
disturb
your
season
due
for
lycidas
is
dead
dead
ere
his
prime
young
lycidas
and
hath
not
left
his
peer
who
would
not
sing
for
lycidas
he
knew
himself
to
sing
and
build
the
lofty
rhyme
he
must
not
float
upon
his
watery
bier
unwept
and
welter
to
the
parching
wind
without
the
meed
of
some
melodious
tear
begin
then
sisters
of
the
sacred
well
that
from
beneath
the
seat
of
jove
doth
spring
begin
and
somewhat
loudly
sweep
the
string
hence
with
denial
vain
and
coy
excuse
so
may
some
gentle
muse
with
lucky
words
favour
my
destined
urn
and
as
he
passes
turn
and
bid
fair
peace
be
to
my
sable
shroud
for
we
were
nursed
upon
the
hill
fed
the
same
flock
by
fountain
shade
and
rill
together
both
ere
the
high
lawns
appeared
under
the
opening
eyelids
of
the
morn
we
drove
afield
and
both
together
heard
what
time
the
gray
fly
winds
her
sultry
horn
battening
our
flocks
with
the
fresh
dews
of
night
oft
till
the
star
that
rose
at
evening
bright
toward
descent
had
sloped
his
westering
wheel
meanwhile
the
rural
ditties
were
not
mute
tempered
to
the
oaten
flute
rough
satyrs
danced
and
fauns
with
cloven
heel
from
the
glad
sound
would
not
be
absent
long
and
old
damætas
loved
to
hear
our
song
but
oh
the
heavy
change
now
thou
art
gone
now
thou
art
gone
and
never
must
return
thee
shepherd
thee
the
woods
and
desert
caves
with
wild
thyme
and
the
gadding
vine
and
all
their
echoes
mourn
the
willows
and
the
hazel
copses
green
shall
now
no
more
be
seen
fanning
their
joyous
leaves
to
thy
soft
lays
as
killing
as
the
canker
to
the
rose
or
to
the
weanling
herds
that
graze
or
frost
to
flowers
that
their
gay
wardrobe
wear
when
first
the
blows
such
lycidas
thy
loss
to
ear
where
were
ye
nymphs
when
the
remorseless
deep
closed
the
head
of
your
loved
lycidas
for
neither
were
ye
playing
on
the
steep
where
your
old
bards
the
famous
druids
lie
nor
on
the
shaggy
top
of
mona
high
nor
yet
where
deva
spreads
her
wizard
stream
ay
me
i
fondly
dream
had
ye
been
there
for
what
could
that
have
done
what
could
the
muse
herself
that
orpheus
bore
the
muse
herself
for
her
enchanting
son
whom
universal
nature
did
lament
when
by
the
rout
that
made
the
hideous
roar
his
gory
visage
down
the
stream
was
sent
down
the
swift
hebrus
to
the
lesbian
shore
alas
what
boots
it
with
incessant
care
to
tend
the
homely
slighted
trade
and
strictly
meditate
the
thankless
muse
were
it
not
better
done
as
others
use
to
sport
with
amaryllis
in
the
shade
or
with
the
tangles
of
hair
fame
is
the
spur
that
the
clear
spirit
doth
raise
that
last
infirmity
of
noble
mind
to
scorn
delights
and
live
laborious
days
but
the
fair
guerdon
when
we
hope
to
find
and
think
to
burst
out
into
sudden
blaze
comes
the
blind
fury
with
the
abhorred
shears
and
slits
the
life
not
the
praise
phoebus
replied
and
touched
my
trembling
ears
is
no
plant
that
grows
on
mortal
soil
nor
in
the
glistering
foil
set
off
to
the
world
nor
in
broad
rumour
lies
but
lives
and
spreads
aloft
by
those
pure
eyes
and
perfect
witness
of
jove
as
he
pronounces

on
each
deed
of
so
much
fame

thy

fountain
arethuse
and
thou
honoured
flood
mincius
crowned
with
vocal
reeds
that
strain
i
heard
was
of
a
higher
mood
but
now
my
oat
proceeds
and
listens
to
the
herald
of
the
sea
that
came
in
plea
he
asked
the
waves
and
asked
the
felon
winds
what
hard
mishap
had
doomed
this
gentle
swain
and
questioned
every
gust
of
rugged
wings
that
blows
from
off
each
beaked
promontory
they
knew
not
of
his
story
and
sage
hippotades
their
answer
brings
that
not
a
blast
was
from
his
dungeon
strayed
the
air
was
calm
and
on
the
level
brine
sleek
panope
with
all
her
sisters
played
it
was
that
fatal
and
perfidious
bark
built
in
the
eclipse
and
rigged
with
curses
dark
that
sunk
so
low
that
sacred
head
of
thine
next
camus
reverend
sire
went
footing
slow
his
mantle
hairy
and
his
bonnet

inwrought
with

flower

with
woe
who

as

into
the

how
to

at

of

the

swollen
with

and
the

besides

the

wolf
with

devours
apace

return

low
where
the
mild
whispers
use
of

wanton
winds
and
gushing
brooks
on
whose
fresh

the
swart
star
sparely
looks
throw
hither
all
your
quaint
enamelled

that
on
the

purple

with
vernal

amaranthus
all
his

shed

thee
the

beyond

perhaps
under

bottom
of

monstrous

whether
thou
to

with

and
o

the
hapless

weep
no

woeful
shepherds
weep
no

for
lycidas
your
sorrow
is
not
dead
sunk
though
he
be
beneath
the
watery
floor
so
sinks
the
in
the
and
yet
anon
repairs
his
drooping
head
and
tricks
his
beams
and
with
ore
flames
in
the
forehead
of
the
morning
sky
so
lycidas
sunk
low
but
mounted
high
through
the
dear
might
of
him
that
walked
the
waves
where
other
groves
and
other
streams
along
with
nectar
pure
his
oozy
locks
he
laves
and
hears
the
unexpressive
nuptial
song
in
the
blest
kingdoms
meek
of
joy
and
love
there
entertain
him
all
the
saints
above
in
solemn
troops
and
sweet
societies
that
sing
and
singing
in
their
glory
move
and
wipe
the
tears
for
ever
from
his
eyes
now
lycidas
the
shepherds
weep
no

henceforth
thou
art
the
genius
of
the
shore
in
thy
large
recompense
and
shalt
be
good
to
all
that
wander
in
that
perilous
flood
thus
sang
the
uncouth
swain
to
the
oaks
and
rills
while
the
still
morn
went
out
with
sandals
gray
he
touched
the
tender
stops
of
various
quills
with
eager
thought
warbling
his
doric
lay
and
now
the
sun
had
stretched
out
all
the
hills
and
now
was
dropped
into
the

year
flings
with
a
bounteous
hand
over
each
green
meadow
the
not
more
quickly
depart
from
his
bosom
fiery
fevers
who
beneath
crimson
hangings
and
pictures
cunningly
broidered
tosses
about
than
from
him
who
must
lie
in
beggarly
raiment
therefore
since
to
the
body
avail
not
riches
avails
not
utmost
boast
nor
the
pomp
and
the
pride
of
an
empire
next
shall
you
own
that
the
mind
needs
likewise
nothing
of
these
things
peradventure
your
armies
over
the
champaign
spread
with
a
stir
and
a
ferment
and
bid
image
awaken
or
when
with
stir
and
with
ferment
a
fleet
sails
forth
upon
cowed
before
these
brave
sights
pale
superstition
abandon
straightway
your
mind
as
you
gaze
death
seem
no
longer
alarming
trouble
vacate
your
bosom
and
peace
hold
holiday
in
you
but
if
again
all
this
be
a
vain
impossible
fiction
if
of
a
truth
fears
and
the
cares
which
hourly
beset
them
heed
not
the
fury
regard
not
clashing
of
broadswords
but
amongst
crowned
heads
and
the
rulers
of
empires
stalk
not
shrinking
abashed
from
the
dazzling
glare
of
the
red
gold
not
from
the
pomp
of
the
monarch
who
walks
forth
these
things
shew
that
at
times
we
are
bankrupt
surely
of
reason
when
too
all
life
through
a
great
dark
laboureth
onward
for
as
a
young
boy
trembles
and
in
that
mystery
darkness
sees
all
terrible
things
so
do
we
too
in
the
daylight
ofttimes
shudder
at
that
which
is
not
more
really
alarming
than
fears
when
they
waken
and
say
some
danger
is
them
so
this
panic
of
mind
these
clouds
which
gather
around
us
fly
not
the
bright
sunbeam
nor
the
ivory
shafts
of
the
nature
rightly
revealed
and
the
reason
only
dispel
them
now
how
moving
about
do
the
prime
material
atoms
shape
forth
this
thing
and
that
thing
and
once
shaped
how
they
resolve
them
what
power
says
unto
each
this
must
be
how
an
inherent
elasticity
drives
them
about
space
vagrantly
onward
i
shall
unfold
thou
simply
give
all
thyself
to
my
teaching
matter
mingled
and
massed
into
indissoluble
union
does
not
exist
for
we
see
how
wastes
each
separate
substance
so
flow
piecemeal
away
with
the
centuries
all
things
till
from
our
eye
by
degrees
that
old
self
passes
and
is
not
still
universal
nature
abides
unchanged
as
aforetime
whereof
this
is
the
cause
when
the
atoms
part
from
a
substance
that
suffers
loss
but
another
is
elsewhere
gaining
an
increase
so
that
as
one
thing
wanes
still
a
second
bursts
into
blossom
soon
in
its
turn
to
be
left
thus
draws
this
universe
always
gain
out
of
loss
thus
live
we
mortals
one
on
another
bourgeons
one
generation
and
one
fades
let
but
a
few
years
pass
and
a
race
has
arisen
which
was
not
as
in
a
racecourse
one
hands
on
to
another
the
burning
torch
of
existence
from
homer
i
sing
o
daughter
of
heaven
of
son
of
achilles
him
whose
terrible
wrath
brought
thousand
woes
on
achaia
many
a
stalwart
soul
did
it
hurl
untimely
to
hades
souls
of
the
heroes
of
old
and
their
bones
lay
strown
on
the
prey
to
the
vulture
and
dog
yet
was
zeus
fulfilling
a
purpose
since
that
day
when
in
hot
strife
parted
asunder
sceptred
son
and
the
of
heaven
achilles
say
then
which
of
the
gods
bid
arise
up
battle
between
them
and
son
with
the
king
was
kindled
his
anger
then
went
sickness
abroad
and
the
people
died
of
the
sickness
for
that
of
son
had
his
priest
been
lightly
entreated
chryses
priest
for
he
came
to
the
ships
of
achaia
bearing
a
ransom
a
sum
not
easy
to
number
and
in
his
hand
was
the
emblem
of
him
apollo
high
on
a
sceptre
of
gold
and
he
made
his
prayer
to
the
grecians
chiefly
to
sons
twin
chieftains
ordering
armies
sprung
of
loins
and
ye
achaians
so
may
the
gods
this
day
the
grant
you
city
to
raze
and
return
unscathed
to
your
homesteads
only
my
own
dear
daughter
i
ask
take
ransom
and
yield
her
his
great
name
son
of
zeus
then
from
the
host
of
achaians
arose
tumultuous
answer
to
the
priest
is
his
honour
accept
rich
ransom
and
yield
but
there
was
war
in
the
spirit
of
son
agamemnon
disdainful
he
dismissed
him
a
right
stern
fiat
appending
be
to
thee
old
man
if
i
find
thee
lingering
longer
yea
or
returning
again
by
the
hollow
ships
of
achaians
scarce
much
then
will
avail
thee
the
great
sceptre
and
emblem
her
will
i
never
release
old
age
must
first
come
upon
her
in
my
own
home
yea
in
argos
afar
from
the
land
of
her
fathers
following
the
loom
and
attending
upon
my
bed
but
avaunt
thee
go
and
provoke
not
me
that
thy
way
may
be
haply
these
were
the
words
of
the
king
and
the
old
man
feared
and
obeyed
him
voiceless
he
went
by
the
shore
of
the
great
ocean
thither
he
got
him
apart
that
ancient
man
and
a
long
prayer
prayed
to
apollo
his
lord
son
of
leto
of
the
silver
bow
whose
arm
girds
chryse
and
cilla
cilla
loved
of
the
gods
in
might
sways
tenedos
hearken
oh
if
in
days
gone
by
i
have
built
from
floor
unto
cornice
smintheus
a
fair
shrine
for
thee
or
burned
in
the
flames
of
the
altar
fat
flesh
of
bulls
and
of
goats
then
do
this
thing
that
i
ask
thee
hurl
on
the
greeks
thy
shafts
that
thy
tears
be
avengèd
so
did
he
pray
and
his
prayer
reached
the
ears
of
phoebus
apollo
dark
was
the
soul
of
the
god
as
he
moved
from
the
heights
of
olympus
shouldering
a
bow
and
a
quiver
on
this
side
fast
and
on
that
side
onward
in
anger
he
moved
and
the
arrows
stirred
by
the
motion
rattled
and
rang
on
his
shoulder
he
came
as
cometh
the
midnight
hard
by
the
ships
he
stayed
him
and
loosed
one
shaft
from
the
harshly
the
stretched
string
twanged
of
the
bow
all
first
fell
his
wrath
on
the
mules
and
the
hound
of
the
herdsman
afterward
smote
he
the
host
with
a
rankling
arrow
he
smote
them
aye
and
the
morn
and
the
even
were
red
with
the
glare
of
the
nine
days
over
the
host
sped
the
shafts
of
the
god
and
the
tenth
day
dawned
and
achilles
said
a
council
called
of
the
such
thought
came
to
his
mind
from
the
goddess
hera
the
hera
who
loved
those
greeks
and
who
saw
them
dying
around
her
so
when
all
were
collected
and
ranged
in
a
solemn
assembly
straightway
rose
up
amidst
them
and
spake
achilles
son
it
were
better
i
think
this
day
that
we
wandered
back
our
homes
if
a
warfare
be
avoided
now
when
the
sword
and
the
plague
these
two
things
fight
with
achaians
come
let
us
seek
out
now
some
priest
some
seer
amongst
us
yea
or
a
dreamer
of
a
dream
too
cometh
of
whence
we
may
learn
what
hath
angered
in
this
wise
phoebus
apollo
whether
mayhap
he
reprove
us
of
prayer
or
of
oxen
unoffered
whether
accepting
the
incense
of
lambs
and
of
blemishless
yet
it
be
his
high
will
to
remove
this
misery
from
down
sat
the
prince
he
had
spoken
and
uprose
to
them
in
answer
kalchas
son
high
chief
of
the
host
of
the
augurs
well
he
knew
what
is
present
what
will
be
and
what
was
aforetime
he
into
harbour
had
led
those
ships
of
achaia
all
by
the
power
of
the
art
which
he
gained
from
phoebus
apollo
thus
then
arising
spake
he
before
them
son
thou
demandest
a
man
an
answer
touching
the
great
wrath
the
apollo
therefore
i
lift
up
my
voice
swear
thou
to
me
duly
digesting
all
with
right
good
will
by
word
and
by
deed
thou
wilt
aid
me
surely
the
ire
will
awaken
of
one
who
mightily
ruleth
over
the
argives
all
and
upon
him
wait
the
achaians
aye
is
the
battle
the
when
a
poor
man
kindleth
his
anger
for
if
but
this
one
day
he
devour
his
indignation
still
on
the
morrow
abideth
a
rage
that
its
end
be
accomplished
deep
in
the
soul
of
the
king
so
bethink
thee
wilt
thou
then
unto
him
making
answer
arose
achilles
nought
up
and
open
the
will
all
that
is
told
thee
for
by
self
favourite
whom
thou
kalchas
serving
aright
to
the
armies
aloud
as
yet
i
breathe
upon
earth
yet
walk
in
the
shall
at
the
hollow
ships
lift
hand
of
oppression
against
thee
none
out
of
all
yon
and
if
thou
agamemnon
who
now
sits
in
his
glory
the
topmost
flower
of
the
then
did
the
blameless
prophet
at
last
wax
valiant
and
answer
he
doth
not
reprove
us
of
prayer
or
of
oxen
unoffered
but
for
his
sake
the
disdained
of
king
agamemnon
in
that
he
loosed
not
his
daughter
inclined
not
his
ear
to
a
ransom
therefore
the
sendeth
and
yet
shall
send
on
us
evil
nor
shall
he
stay
from
the
slaughter
the
hand
that
is
heavy
upon
you
till
to
her
own
dear
father
the
maiden
is
yielded
no
price
asked
no
ransom
and
ships
bear
hallowèd
oxen
it
may
be
will
he
shew
mercy
and
hear
these
words
said
sat
he
down
then
rose
in
his
place
and
addressed
them
warrior
son
agamemnon
king
of
the
nations
sore
grieved
fury
was
working
in
each
dark
cell
of
his
bosom
and
in
his
eye
was
a
glare
as
a
burning
fiery
furnace
first
to
the
priest
he
addressed
him
his
whole
mien
boding
a
mischief
of
ill
luck
never
heard
i
of
aught
good
from
thee
but
evil
still
doth
the
evil
thing
unto
thee
seem
sweeter
of
leaving
the
thing
which
is
good
all
unspoke
all
unaccomplished
lo
this
day
to
the
people
thou
opening
what
but
that
am
the
cause
why
the
hand
worketh
against
them
for
that
in
sooth
i
rejected
a
ransom
aye
and
a
rich
one
brought
for
the
girl
briseis
i
did
for
i
chose
to
possess
her
rather
at
home
less
favour
hath
clytemnestra
before
me
clytemnestra
my
wife
unto
her
briseis
is
equal
equal
in
form
and
in
stature
in
mind
and
in
womanly
wisdom
still
even
thus
am
i
ready
to
yield
her
so
it
be
better
better
is
saving
alive
i
hold
than
slaying
a
nation
meanwhile
deck
me
a
guerdon
in
her
stead
lest
of
achaians
i
should
alone
lack
honour
an
unmeet
thing
and
a
shameful
see
all
men
that
my
guerdon
i
wot
not
whither
it
then
unto
him
made
answer
the
chieftain
achilles
most
vaunting
of
men
most
of
atreus
how
shall
the
lords
of
achaia
bestow
fresh
guerdon
upon
thee
surely
we
know
not
yet
of
a
treasure
piled
in
abundance
that
which
the
sacking
of
cities
hath
brought
to
us
all
hath
an

it
were

unfit

yield
thou
the
maid
to
the
