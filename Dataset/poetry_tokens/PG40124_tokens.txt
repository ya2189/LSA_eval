preface
the
favourable
reception
of
literary
frivolities
by
the
press
has
led
to
the
preparation
of
this
work
as
a
sequel
in
which
the
only
sin
so
far
charged
against
the
frivolities
that
of
omission
will
be
found
fully
atoned
for
those
curious
in
regard
to
the
historical
and
literary
accounts
of
several
of
the
various
phases
of
composition
exemplified
in
this
work
will
find
these
fully
enough
noticed
in
literary
frivolities
in
which
none
of
the
examples
were
strictly
original
and
had
been
gathered
from
many
outlying
corners
of
the
world
of
literature
in
the
present
work
however
will
be
found
a
number
of
pieces
which
have
not
hitherto
been
glorified
in
type
and
these
have
been
furnished
by
various
literary
gentlemen
among
whom
may
be
named
professor
palmer
and
appleton
morgan
of
new
york

both

carroll
for
a
kindly
and
courteous
permission
to
quote
from
his
works
with
regard
to
a
few
of
the
extracts
the
difficulty
of
finding
their
authors
has
been
a
bar
to
requesting
permission
to
use
them
but
in
every
case
endeavour
has
been
made
to

they

parody
is
the
name
generally
given
to
a
humorous
or
burlesque
imitation
of
a
serious
poem
or
song
of
which
it
so
far
preserves
the
style
and
words
of
the
original
as
that
the
latter
may
be
easily
recognised
it
also
may
be
said
to
consist
in
the
application
of
poetry
to
familiar
objects
should
be
confined
within
narrow
limits
and
only
adapted
to
light
and
momentary
occasions
though
by
no
means
the
highest
kind
of
literary
composition
and
generally
used
to
ridicule
the
poets
still
many
might
think
their
reputation
increased
rather
than
diminished
by
the
involuntary
applause
of
imitators
and
parodists
and
have
no
objection
that
their
works
afford
the
public
double
amusement
first
in
the
original
and
afterwards
in
the
travesty
though
the
parodist
may
not
always
be
intellectually
up
to
the
level
of
his
prototype
parodies
are
best
however
when
short
and
striking
when
they
produce
mirth
by
the
happy
imitation
of
some
popular
passage
or
when
they
mix
instruction
with
amusement
by
showing
up
some
latent
absurdity
or
developing
the
disguises
of
bad
taste
the
invention
of
this
humoristic
style
of
composition
has
been
attributed
to
the
greeks
from
whose
language
the
name
itself
is
derived
beside
a
song
the
first
to
use
it
being
supposed
to
be
hegemon
of
thasos
who
flourished
during
the
peloponnesian
war
by
others
the
credit
of
the
invention
is
given
to
hipponax
who
in
his
picture
of
a
glutton
parodies
homer
description
of
the
feats
of
achilles
in
fighting
with
his
hero
in
eating
this
work
begins
as
follows
sing
o
celestial
goddess
eurymedon
foremost
of
gluttons
whose
stomach
devours
like
charybdis
eater
unmatched
among
mortals
the
battle
of
the
frogs
and
mice
the
batrachomyomachia
also
a
happy
specimen
of
the
parody
is
said
to
be
a
travesty
of
homer
iliad
and
numerous
examples
will
be
found
in
the
comedies
of
aristophanes
among
the
romans
this
form
of
literary
composition
made
its
appearance
at
the
period
of
the
decline
and
all
the
power
of
nero
could
not
prevent
persius
from
parodying
his
verses
the
french
among
modern
nations
have
been
much
given
to
it
whilst
in
the
english
language
there
are
many
examples
one
of
the
earliest
being
the
parodying
of
milton
by
john
philips
one
of
the
most
artificial
poets
of
his
age
he
was
an
avowed
imitator
of
milton
and
certainly
evinced
considerable
talent
in
his
peculiar
line
philips
wrote
in
blank
verse
a
poem
on
the
victory
of
blenheim
and
another
on
cider
the
latter
in
imitation
of
the
georgics
his
best
work
however
is
that
from
which
there
follows
a
quotation
a
parody
on
paradise
lost
considered
by
steele
to
be
the
best
burlesque
poem
extant

man
who
void
of

and

in

in

retains
a
splendid
shilling
he
nor
hears
with
pain
new
oysters
cried
nor
sighs
for
cheerful
ale
but
with
his
friends
when
nightly
mists
arise

eye
transfixed

soul

triumphant
perhaps
the
best
english
examples
of
the
true
parody
the
above
being
more
of
an
imitation
are
to
be
found
in
the
rejected
addresses
of
the
brothers
james
and
horace
smith
this
work
owed
its
origin
to
the
reopening
of
drury
lane
theatre
in
after
its
destruction
by
fire
the
managers
in
the
true
spirit
of
tradesmen
issued
an
advertisement
calling
for
addresses
one
of
which
should
be
spoken
on
the
opening
night
were
sent
in
for
competition
overwhelmed
by
the
amount
of
talent
thus
placed
at
their
disposal
the
managers
summarily
rejected
the
whole
and
placed
themselves
under
the
care
of
lord
byron
whose
composition
after
all
was
thought
by
some
to
be
if
not
unworthy
at
least
for
the
occasion
ward
the
secretary
of
the
theatre
having
casually
started
the
idea
of
publishing
a
series
of
rejected
addresses
composed
by
the
most
popular
authors
of
the
day
the
brothers
smith
eagerly
adopted
the
suggestion
and
in
six
weeks
the
volume
was
published
and
received
by
the
public
with
enthusiastic
delight
they
were
principally
humorous
imitations
of
eminent
authors
and
lord
jeffrey
said
of
them
in
the
i
take
them
indeed
to
be
the
very
best
imitations
and
often
of
difficult
originals
that
ever
were
made
and
considering
their
great
extent
and
variety
to
indicate
a
talent
to
which
i
do
not
know
where
to
look
for
a
parallel
some
few
of
them
descend
to
the
level
of
parodies
but
by
far
the
greater
part
are
of
a
much
higher
description
the
one
which
follows
is
in
imitation
of
crabbe
and
was
written
by
james
smith
and
jeffrey
thought
it
the
best
piece
in
the
collection
it
is
an
exquisite
and
masterly
imitation
not
only
of
the
peculiar
style
but
of
the
taste
temper
and
manner
of
description
of
that
most
original
author
crabbe
himself
said
regarding
it
that
it
was
admirably
done
the
theatre
is

the

verses
regarding
henry

the

apparent

the
following
felicitous
parody
on
wolfe
lines
on
the
burial
of
sir
john
moore
is
taken
from
thomas
hood
not
a
laugh
was
heard
nor
a
joyous
note
as
our
friend
to
the
bridal
we
hurried
not
a
wit
discharged
his
farewell
joke
as
the
bachelor
went
to
be
married
we
married
him
quickly
to
save
his
fright
our
heads
from
the
sad
sight
turning
and
we
sighed
as
we
stood
by
the
lamp
dim
light
to
think
him
not
more
discerning
to
think
that
a
bachelor
free
and
bright
and
shy
of
the
sex
as
we
found
him
should
there
at
the
altar
at
dead
of
night
be
caught
in
the
snares
that
bound
him
few
and
short
were
the
words
we
said
though
of
cake
and
wine
partaking
we
escorted
him
home
from
the
scene
of
dread
while
his
knees
were
awfully
shaking
slowly
and
sadly
we
marched
adown
from
the
top
to
the
lowermost
story
and
we
have
never
heard
from
nor
seen
the
poor
man
whom
we
left
alone
in
his
glory
barham
has
also
left
us
a
parody
on
the
same
lines
not
a
sou
had
he
got
not
a
guinea
or
note
and
he
looked
most
confoundedly
flurried
as
he
bolted
away
without
paying
his
shot
and
the
landlady
after
him
hurried
we
saw
him
again
at
dead
of
night
when
home
from
the
club
returning
we
twigged
the
doctor
beneath
the
light
of
the
gas
lamp
brilliantly
burning
all
bare
and
exposed
to
the
midnight
dews
reclined
in
the
gutter
we
found
him
and
he
looked
like
a
gentleman
taking
a
snooze
with
his
marshall
cloak
around
him
doctor
is
as
drunk
as
the
d
l
we
said
and
we
managed
a
shutter
to
borrow
we
raised
him
and
sighed
at
the
thought
that
his
head
would
confoundedly
ache
on
the
morrow
we
bore
him
home
and
we
put
him
to
bed
and
we
told
his
wife
and
daughter
to
give
him
next
morning
a
couple
of
red
herrings
with
loudly
they
talked
of
his
money
that
gone
and
his
lady
began
to
upbraid
him
but
little
he
reck
so
they
let
him
snore
on
the
counterpane
just
as
we
laid
him
we
tuck
him
in
and
had
hardly
done
when
beneath
the
window
calling
we
heard
the
rough
voice
of
a
son
of
a
gun
of
a
watchman
bawling
slowly
and
sadly
we
all
walk
down
from
his
room
on
the
uppermost
story
a
rushlight
we
placed
on
the
cold
and
we
left
him
alone
in
his
glory
in
the
examples
which
follow
the
selection
has
been
made
on
the
principle
of
giving
only
those
of
which
the
prototypes
are
well
known
and
will
be
easily
recognised
and
here
is
another
of
hood
written
on
a
popular
ballad
we
met
was
in
a
mob
and
i
thought
he
had
done
me
i
felt
i
could
not
feel
for
no
watch
was
upon
me
he
ran
the
night
was
cold
and
his
pace
was
unaltered
i
too
longed
much
to
pelt
but
my
legs
faltered
i
wore
my
brand
new
boots
and
unrivalled
their
brightness
they
fit
me
to
a
hair
how
i
hated
their
tightness
i
called
but
no
one
came
and
my
stride
had
a
tether
oh
hast
been
the
cause
of
this
anguish
my
leather
and
once
again
we
met
and
an
old
pal
was
near
him
he
swore
a
something
low
but
was
no
use
to
fear
him
i
seized
upon
his
arm
he
was
mine
and
mine
only
and
stept
as
he
deserved
to
cells
wretched
and
lonely
and
there
he
will
be
tried
but
i
shall
receive
her
the
watch
that
went
too
sure
for
an
artful
deceiver
the
world
may
think
me
gay
heart
and
feet
ache
together
oh
hast
been
the
cause
of
this
anguish
my
leather
here
is
another
upon
an
old
favourite
song
the
bandit
fate
he
wore
a
brace
of
pistols
the
night
when
first
we
met
his
brow
was
frowning
beneath
his
wig
of
jet
his
footsteps
had
the
moodiness
his
voice
the
hollow
tone
of
a
bandit
chief
who
feels
remorse
and
tears
his
hair
alone
i
saw
him
but
at
but
methinks
i
see
him
now
in
the
tableau
of
the
last
act
with
the
blood
upon
his
brow
a
private
bandit
belt
and
boots
when
next
we
met
he
wore
his
salary
he
told
me
was
lower
than
before
and
standing
at
the
wing
he
strove
and
not
in
vain
to
borrow
half
a
sovereign
which
he
never
paid
again
i
saw
it
but
a
moment
and
i
wish
i
saw
it
now
as
he
buttoned
up
his
pocket
with
a
condescending
bow
and
once
again
we
met
but
no
bandit
chief
was
there
his
rouge
was
off
and
gone
that
head
of
once
luxuriant
hair
he
lodges
in
a
back
and
at
the
public
near
he
can
not
liquidate
his
or
wipe
away
his
beer
i
saw
him
sad
and
seedy
yet
methinks
i
see
him
now
in
the
tableau
of
the
last
act
with
the
blood
upon
his
brow
goldsmith
when
lovely
woman
stoops
to
folly
has
been
thus
parodied
by
shirley
brooks
when
lovely
woman
lump
of
folly
would
show
the
world
her
vainest
trait
would
treat
herself
as
child
her
dolly
and
warn
each
man
of
sense
away
the
surest
method
she
discover
to
prompt
a
wink
in
every
eye
degrade
a
spouse
disgust
a
lover
and
spoil
a
is
to
dye
examples
like
these
are
numerous
and
may
be
found
in
the
bon
gaultier
ballads
of
theodore
martin
and
professor
aytoun
the
ingoldsby
legends
of
barham
and
the
works
of
lewis
carroll
one
of
the
bon
gaultier
travesties
was
on
macaulay
and
was
called
the
laureate
journey
of
which
these
two
verses
are
part
dead
he
dead
the
laureate
dead
thus
thus
the
cry
began
and
straightway
every
garret
roof
gave
up
its
minstrel
man
from
grub
street
and
from
houndsditch
and
from
farringdon
within
the
poets
all
towards
whitehall
poured
in
with
eldritch
din
loud
yelled
they
for
sir
james
the
graham
but
sore
afraid
was
he
a
hardy
knight
were
he
that
might
face
such
a
minstrelsie
by
giles
of
netherby
my
patron
saint
i
swear
i
rather
by
a
thousand
crowns
lord
palmerston
were
here
it
is
necessary
however
to
confine
our
quotations
within
reasonable
limits
and
a
few
from
the
modern
writers
must
suffice
the
next
is
by
henry
leigh
one
of
the
best
living
writers
of
burlesque
verse
only
seven
a
pastoral
story
after
wordsworth
i
marvelled
why
a
simple
child
that
lightly
draws
its
breath
should
utter
groans
so
very
wild
and
look
as
pale
as
death
adopting
a
parental
tone
i
asked
her
why
she
cried
the
damsel
answered
with
a
groan
got
a
pain
inside
i
thought
it
would
have
sent
me
mad
last
night
about
eleven
said
i
is
it
makes
you
bad
how
many
apples
have
you
had
she
answered
seven
are
you
sure
you
took
no
more
my
little
maid
quoth
i
please
sir
mother
gave
me
four
but
they
were
in
a
pie
that
the
case
i
stammered
out
course
you
had
eleven
the
maiden
answered
with
a
pout
ai
had
more
nor
seven
i
wondered
hugely
what
she
meant
and
said
bad
at
riddles
but
i
know
where
little
girls
are
sent
for
telling
tarradiddles
now
if
you
do
reform
said
i
never
go
to
heaven
but
all
in
vain
each
time
i
try
the
little
idiot
makes
reply
ai
had
more
nor
seven
postscript
to
borrow
wordsworth
name
was
wrong
or
slightly
misapplied
and
so
i
better
call
my
song
from
swinburne
alliterative
style
lays
him
particularly
open
to
the
skilful
parodist
and
he
has
been
well
imitated
by
mortimer
collins
who
perhaps
is
as
well
known
as
novelist
as
poet
the
following
example
is
entitled
if
if
life
were
never
bitter
and
love
were
always
sweet
then
who
would
care
to
borrow
a
moral
from
if
thames
would
always
glitter
and
joy
would
retreat
if
life
were
never
bitter
and
love
were
always
sweet
if
care
were
not
the
waiter
behind
a
fellow
chair
when
sinners
sit
down
to
richmond
dinners
and
life
swift
stream
goes
straighter
by
jove
it
would
be
rare
if
care
were
not
the
waiter
behind
a

when

given
a
good
imitation
of

i

her
into

and
conquered
her
scruples
and
gloom
and
we
passed
to
the
end
of

were
stopped
by
the
warning
of

by

words
that
were

calverley
is
perhaps
one
of
the
best
of
the
later
parodists
and
he
hits
off
tennyson
browning
coventry
patmore
and
others
most
inimitably
we
give
a
couple
of
verses
from
one
a
parody
of
his
upon
a
lyric
of
tennyson
and
few
we
think
after
perusing
it
would
be
able
to
read
the
brook
without
its
murmur
being
associated
with
the
wandering
tinker
i
loiter
down
by
thorp
and
town
for
any
job
i
willing
take
here
and
there
a
dusty
brown
and
here
and
there
a
shilling
thus
on
he
prattled
like
a
babbling
brook
then
i

has
slept
behind

my

at

so
in

we
parted
i
to

to
the

it
was
noised
next
noon
that
chickens
had
been
missed
at
syllabub
farm
tennyson
home
they
brought
her
warrior
dead
has
likewise
been
differently
travestied
by
various
writers
one
of
these
by
sawyer
is
given
here
the
recognition
home
they
brought
her
sailor
son
grown
a
man
across
the
sea
tall
and
broad
and
black
of
beard
and
hoarse
of
voice
as
man
may
be
hand
to
shake
and
mouth
to
kiss
both
he
offered
ere
he
spoke
but
she
said
man
is
this
comes
to
play
a
sorry
joke
then
they
praised
him
call
him
lad
that
ever
stept
but
her
son
she
did
not
know
and
she
neither
smiled
nor
wept
rose
a
nurse
of
ninety
years
set
a
in

she
saw
him
eat
tis
he
is
he
she
knew
him
by
his

the
has
also

in
some
verses

which
these
are
the

four
lines
you
may
lay
me
in

mother
my

desponding
child
draw
me
a
pot
of

mother

mild
calverley
has
imitated
well
also
the
old
ballad
style
as
in
this
one
of
which
we
give
the
opening
verses
it
was
a
railway
passenger
and
he
leapt
out
jauntilie
up
and
bear
thou
proud
portèr
my
two

me
fetch
me

a

william
the
young
man
said
your
hair
has
become
very
white
and
yet
you
incessantly
stand
on
your

do
you
think
at
your
age
it
is
right
my
youth
father
william
replied
to
his
son
feared
it
might
injure
the
brain
but
now
i
am
perfectly
sure
i
have
none
why
i
do
it
again
and
again
are
old
said
the
youth
your
jaws
are
too
weak
for
anything
tougher
than

yet
you
finished
the
goose
with
the
bones
and
the
beak
pray
how
do
you
manage
to
do
it
my
youth
said
his
father
took
to
the
law
and
argued
each
case
with
my
wife
and
the
muscular
strength
which
it
gave
to
my

lasted
the

of
my

some
good
examples
such
as
that
on
the
hiawatha
of

of

also
that
on
southey
how
the

come
down

just
how

the

also
been
travestied
by

by
freak
of
my
most
exciting
hopes
are
dashed
i
never
wore
my
spotless
ducks
but
madly
wildly
they
were
splashed
i
never
roved
by
cynthia
beam
to
gaze
upon
the
starry

but
some
old
beetle
came
and
charged
into
my
pensive
eye
and
oh
i
never
did
the
swell
in
regent
street
amongst
the
beaus
but
smuts
the
most
prodigious
fell

always
settled

moore

been

you

i
never

the

shakespeare
soliloquy
in
hamlet
has
been
frequently
selected
as
a
subject
for
parody
the
first
we
give
being
the
work
of
burnand
in
happy
thoughts
to
sniggle
or
to
dibble
that
the
question
whether
to
bait
a
hook
with
worm
or
bumble
or
to
take
up
arms
of
any
sea
some
trouble
to
fish
and
then
home
send
to
fly
to
whip
to
moor
and
tie
my
boat
up
by
the
end
to
any
wooden
post
or
natural
rock
we
may
be
near
to
on
a
preservation
devoutly
to
be
fished
to
fly
to
whip
to
whip
perchance
two
bream
and
there
the
chub
cremation
to
urn
or
not
to
urn
that
is
the
question
whether
is
better
in
our
frames
to
suffer
the
shows
and
follies
of
outrageous
custom
or
to
take
fire
against
a
sea
of
zealots
and
by
consuming
end
them
to
urn
to
keep
no
more
and
while
we
keep
to
say
we
end
contagion
and
the
thousand
graveyard
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
is
a
devoutly
to
be
wished
to
burn
to
keep
to
keep
perchance
to
lose
ay
there
the
rub
for
in
the
course
of
things
what
duns
may
come
or
who
may
shuffle
off
our
dresden
urn
must
give
us
pause
there
the
respect
that
makes
of
so
long
use
for
who
would
have
the
pall
and
plumes
of
hire
the
tradesman
prize
a
proud
man
obsequies
the
chaffering
for
graves
the
legal
fee
the
cemetery
beadle
and
the
rest
when
he
himself
might
his
few
ashes
make
with
a
mere
furnace
who
would
tombstones
bear
and
lie
beneath
a
lying
epitaph
but
that
the
dread
of
simmering
after
death
that
uncongenial
furnace
from
whose
burn
no
incremate
returns
weakens
the
will
and
makes
us
rather
bear
the
graves
we
have
than
fly
to
ovens
that
we
know
not
of
the
next
on
the
same
subject
is
from
an
american
source
where
it
is
introduced
by
the
remark
i
suppose
they
be
wanting
us
to
change
our
language
as
well
as
our
habits
our
years
will
have
to
be
dated
in
the
year
of
cremation
and
creation
to
cremation
will
serve
instead
of
the
cradle
to
the
grave
we
may
expect
also
some
lovely
elegies
in
the
future
something
in
the
following
style
perhaps
for
of
course
when
gravediggers
are
succeeded
by
the
grave
laments
of
yore
will
be
replaced
by
lighter
melodies
above
your
mantel
in
the
new
screen
shade
where
smokes
the
coal
in
one
dull
smouldering
heap
each
in
his
patent
urn
for
ever
laid
the
baked
residue
of
our
fathers
sleep
the
wheezy
call
of
muffins
in
the
morn
the
milkman
tottering
from
his
rushy
sled
the
help
shrill
clarion
or
the
fishman
horn
no
more
shall
rouse
them
from
their
lofty

for
them
no
more
the
blazing
burns
or
busy
housewife

her
savoury
soles
though
children
run
to
clasp
their
sires
red
urns
and
roll
them
in
a
family
game
of
bowls
perhaps
in
this
deserted
pot
is
laid
some
heart

pregnant
with
celestial
fire

have
swayed

the

amusing
verses

and
we
can
only
refer
to
the
prose
parodies
of
thackeray
novels
by
eminent
hands
and
bret
harte
condensed
novels
renderings
of
popular
ballads
in
this
way
are
common
enough
in
our
comic
periodicals
as
indeed
one
appeared
in
a
number
of
years
ago
called
ozokerit
a
travesty
of
tennyson
in
memoriam
which
has
been
considered
one
of
the
finest
ever
written
they
are
to
be
found
too
in
many
of
those
burlesques
and
extravaganzas
which
are
put
upon
the
stage
now
and
these
the
late
planchè
had
a
delightful
faculty
of
writing
the
happiness
and
ring
of
which
have
rarely
been
equalled
take
for
instance
one
verse
of
a
parody
in
jason
on
a
air
in
the
waterman
now
farewell
my
argo
greece
and
fleece
and
all
farewell
never
more
as
supercargo
shall
poor
jason
cut
a
swell
and
here
is
the
opening
verse
of
another
song
by
the
same
author
when
other
lips
and
other
eyes
their
tales
of
love
shall
tell
which
means
the
usual
sort
of
lies
you
heard
from
many
a
swell
when
bored
with
what
you
feel
is
bosh
you
give
the
world
to
see
a
friend
whose
love
you
know
will
wash
oh
then
remember
me
another
very
popular
song
has
been
parodied
in
this
way
by
carroll
beautiful

rich

for
such
dainties

not
stoop

american
papers
put
in
circulation
many
little
verses
such
as
this
the
melancholy
days
have
come
the
saddest
of
the
year
too
warm
alas
for
whiskey
punch
too

for

and
this
in
reference
to
the

breathes
there
a

so

a
number
of
periodicals
nowadays
make
parody
and
other
styles
of
literary
composition
a
feature
in
their
issues
by
way
of
competition
for
prizes
and
one
of
these
is
given
here
the
author
signs
himself
hermon
and
the
poem
was
selected
by
the
editor
of
truth
november
for
a
prize
in
a
competition
of
parodies
upon
excelsior
it
is
called
that
having
reference
it
is
perhaps
hardly
necessary
to
state
to
the
american
puzzle
of
that
name
which
has
proved
so
perplexing
an
affair
to
some
people
that
chill
august
storms
were
piping
loud
when
through
a
gaping
london
crowd
there
passed
a
youth
who
still
was
heard
to
mutter
the
perplexing
word
his
eyes
were
wild
his
brow
above
was
crumpled
like
an
old
and
like
some
hoarse
crow
grating
note
that
word
still
quivered
in
his
throat
give
it
up
his
comrades
said
only
muddles
your
poor
head
it
is
not
worth
your
finding
out
he
answered
with
a
wailing
shout
not
content
the
maiden
said
solve
the
fifteen
instead
he
paused
his
tearful
eyes
he
dried
gulped
down
a
sob
then
sadly
sighed
at
midnight
on
their
high
resort
the
cats
were
startled
at
their
sport
to
hear
beneath
one
roof
a
tone
gasp
out
betwixt
a
snore
and
groan
this
ingenious
style
of
versification
where
the
last
word
or
phrase
in
each
line
is
taken
for
the
beginning
of
the
next
is
sometimes
also
called
concatenation
verse
the
invention
of
this
mode
of
composition
is
claimed
by
lasphrise
a
french
poet
who
wrote
the
following
que

poem

is

an
american
gentleman

states
that
he

never

print
and
knows
not
the

rhythm
somewhat
resembles

above
as
he
was
commonly
called
byrom
seems
to
have
been
an
amiable
and
excellent
man
and
his
friends
after
his
death
in
september
collected
and
published
all
the
verses
of
his
they
could
lay
hands
on
in
vols
at
manchester
in
a
more
complete
edition
was
issued
in
many
of
byrom
poems
evince
talent
but
a
great
part
are
only
calculated
for
private
perusal
his
diary
and
remains
were
published
by
the
chetham
society
byrom
was
the
inventor
of
a
successful
system
of
shorthand
he
was
a
decided
jacobite
and
his
mode
of
defending
his
sentiments
on
this
point
are
still
remembered
and
quoted
god

the
king
i
mean
the

defender
god
bless
no
harm
in
blessing
the
pretender
but
who
pretender
is
or
who
the

god
bless
us
all
that
quite
another
thing
macaronic
verse
is
properly
a
system
of
latin
inflections
joined
to
words
of
a
modern
vernacular
such
as
english
french
german
some
writers
however
choose
to
disregard
the
strictness
of
this
definition
and
consider
everything
macaronic
which
is
written
with
the
aid
of
more
than
one
language
or
dialect
geddes
born
died
considered
one
of
the
greatest
of
english
macaronic
writers
says
it
is
the
characteristic
of
a
macaronic
poem
to
be
written
in
latin
hexameters
but
so
as
to
admit
occasionally
vernacular
words
either
in
their
native
form
or
with
a
latin
inflection
other
licenses
too
are
allowed
in
the
measure
of
the
lines
contrary
to
the
strict
rules
of
prosody
broad
enough
reservations
these
of
which
geddes
in
his
own
works
was
not
slow
in
availing
himself
and
as
will
be
seen
in
the
specimens
given
his
example
has
been
well
followed
for
the
strict
rule
that
an
english
macaronic
should
consist
of
the
vernacular
made
classical
with
latin
terminations
has
been
as
much
honoured
in
the
breach
as
in
the
observance
another
characteristic
in
macaronics
is
that
these
poems
recognise
no
law
in
orthography
etymology
syntax
or
prosody
the
examples
which
here
follow
are
confined
exclusively
to
those
which
have
their
basis
so
to
speak
in
the
english
language
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
of
the
earlier
ones
the
majority
of
the
selections
in
this
volume
have
their
origin
in
our
own
times

to

the

from

when
two

were
expelled
from

a

the

epitaph

a

at

helped
his

to
a

saying

was
the
reply
it
could
not
be
another
gentleman
while
driving
one
day
was
asked
by
a
lady
if
some
fowls
they
passed
were
ducks
or
geese
one
of
the
latter
at
the
moment
lifting
up
its
voice
the
gentleman
said
that
your
well
tom
are
you
sick
again
asked
a
student
of
his
friend
and
was
answered
in
english
and
in
latin
victor
hugo
was
once
asked
if
he
could
write
english
poetry
certainement
was
the
reply
and
he
sat
down
and
wrote

verse

he
gives

was
as
follows

you

remonstrated

mr

against
the
sending

it
was
so
mixed
up
that
the
landlord
would
never
be
able
to
make

of
it

blucher
said
he
guessed
the

of
it

average

rest

one
of
the
most
curious
efforts
in
the
way
of

was
that
attempted

a
work
published

in

writes
us
that
fonseca
manufactured
this
work
by
procuring
a
book
of
french
dialogues
which
he
put
word
by
word
into
english
by
the
aid
of
a
dictionary
of
which
he
knew
not
a
word
and
what
is
strangest
did
not
learn
a
word
even
while
writing
his
that
he
really
humbugged
his
bookseller
appears
from
this
that
he
induced
the
poor
victim
to
publish
a
large
english
dictionary
this
book
has
been
reprinted
as
a
literary
curiosity
and
may
be
had
at
quaritch
piccadilly
london
under
the
title
of
a
new
guide
to
the
english
by
pedro
carolina
fonseca
having
taken
his
name
out
and
dating
the
book
from
pekin
this
being
a
mere
joke
however
the
original
was
a
serious
work
and
by
way
of
introduction
to
a
poem
in
the

kindly
given
us
by
professor
palmer
we
give
a
few
particulars
of
and
extracts
from
the
work
itself
and
here
is
the
preface
a
choice
of
familiar
dialogues
clean
of
gallicisms
and
despoiled
phrases
it
was
missing
yet
to
studious
portuguese
and
brazilian
youth
and
also
to
persons
of
other
nations
that
wish
to
know
the
portuguese
language
we
sought
all
we
may
do
to
correct
that
want
composing
and
divising
the
present
little
work
in
two
parts
the
first
includes
a
greatest
vocabulary
proper
names
by
alphabetical
order
and
the
second
dialogues
adapted
to
the
usual
precisions
of
the
life
for
that
reason
we
did
put
with
a
scrupulous
exactness
a
great
variety
own
expressions
to
english
and
portugues
idioms
without
to
attach
us
selves
as
make
some
others
almost
at
a
literal
translation
translation
what
only
will
be
for
to
accustom
the
portuguese
pupils
or
foreign
to
speak
very
bad
any
of
the
mentioned
idioms
we
were
increasing
this
second
edition
with
a
phraseology
in
the
first
part
and
some
familiar
letters
anecdotes
idiotisms
proverbs
and
to
second
a
coin
index
the
which
we
were
confering
for
this
labour
find
use
us
for
nothing
but
those
what
were
publishing
to
portugal
or
out
they
were
almost
all
composed
for
some
foreign
or
for
some
national
little
acquainted
in
the
spirit
of
both
languages
it
was
resulting
from
that
corelessness
to
rest
these
fill
of
imperfections
and
anomalies
of
style
in
spite
of
the
infinite
typographical
faults
which
sometimes
invert
the
sense
of
the
periods
it
increase
not
to
contain
any
of
those
the
figured
pronunciation
of
the
english
words
nor
the
prosodical
accent
in
the
portugese
indispensable
object
whom
wish
to
speak
the
english
and
portuguese
languages
correctly
we
expect
then
who
the
little
book
for
the
care
what
we
wrote
him
and
for
her
typographical
correction
that
may
be
worth
the
acceptance
of
the
studious
persons
and
especially
of
the
youth
at
which
we
dedicate
him
particularly
the
greatest
vocabulary
proper
names
is
in
three
columns
the
first
giving
the
portuguese
the
second
the
english
words
and
the
third
the
english
pronunciation
dô
múndo
of
the
world
ove

the
stars
thi
esters
môça
young
girl
guerle
o

the
flash
of
lightning
thi
flax
ove

the
vocabulary
fills
about
fifty
pages
and
is
followed
by
a
series
of
familiar
phrases
of
which
a
few
are
here
given

the
dialogues

but
these
conversations

dialogues
however
amusing
are
as
nothing

compared
with
the
anecdotes

are
given
by

pidgin
english
is
the
name
given
to
the
dialect
extensively
used
in
the
seaport
towns
of
china
as
a
means
of
communication
between
the
natives
and
english
and
americans
and
is
a
very
rude
jargon
in
which
english
words
are
very
strangely
distorted
it
is
very
limited
the
chinese
learning
pidgin
with
only
the
acquirement
of
a
few
hundred
words
the
pronunciation
and
grammar
of
which
have
been
modified
to
suit
those
of
their
own
language
the
word
pidgin
itself
is
derived
through
a
series
of
changes
in
the
word
early
traders
made
constant
use
of
this
word
and
the
chinaman
contracted
it
first
to
and
then
through
the
change
to
it
at
length
assumed
the
form
of
still
retaining
its
original
meaning
this
at
once
shows
the
difficulty
which
a
chinaman
has
in
mastering
the
pronunciation
of
english
words
and
as
business
or
commerce
is
the
great
bond
of
union
between
the
chinese
and
the
foreign
residents
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
this
word
should
give
name
to
the
jargon
formed
in
its
service
the
chinese
have
great
difficulty
in
using
the
letter
pronouncing
it
almost
always
like
as
for
for
and
for
the
sake
of
euphony
often
add
or
to
the
end
of
words
or
is
a
word
of
no
meaning
being
used
as
a
kind
of
interjection
means
quick
quick

in
connection
with
these
linguistic
curiosities
we
take
the
following
from
an
old
number
of
a
practical
parent
objects
to
the
silliness
of
our
nursery
rhymes
for
the
reason
that
the
doggerel
is
rendered
pernicious
by
the
absence
of
a
practical
moral
purpose
and
as
introducing
infants
to
the
realities
of
life
through
an
utterly
erroneous
medium
they
are
taught
to
believe
in
a
world
peopled
by
little
and
goosey
goosey
ganders
instead
of
a
world
of
new
york
central
erie
preferred
it
is
proposed
therefore
to
accommodate
the
teaching
of
the
nursery
to
the
requirements
of
the
age
to
invest
children
rhymes
with
a
moral
purpose
instead
for
example
of
the
blind
wonderment
as
to
the
nature
of
astronomical
bodies
inculcated
in
that
feeble
poem
commencing

the
child
be
indoctrinated
into

then
again
there
is
the

career
of

which
inculcates

it
is
practicable
that
this
fictitious
hero
should
familiarise
the
child
with
the
principles
of
the
john

latin

valueless

unmeaning

be
invested
with
some

an
idyl
on
joachim

at
a
classical
soiree
in
june
while
jolly
dogs
laughed
at
themes
from

longed
for
a

the

be
impressed
upon
the
female
mind
at
an
early
age
in
the
following
moral
miss
muffit
sat
at
a
buffet
eating
a
a
younger
son
spied
her
and
edged
up
beside
her
but
she
properly
frowned
him
away
the
preceding
is
all
very
well
but
there
are
others
which
have
been
travestied
and
changed
also
mary
little
lamb
for
instance
will
never
be
allowed
to
rest
in
its
true
saxon
garb
but
is
being
constantly
dressed
in
every
tongue
and
dialect
but
recently
one
has
arisen
bold
enough
to
doubt
the
story
altogether
and
throw
discredit
on
the
song
baring
gould
and
iconoclasts
like
him
strive
to
show
that
william
tell
and
other
ancient
heroes
never
did
live
but
we
never
expected
to
doubt
the
existence
of
mary
little
lamb
yet
a
correspondent
to
a
magazine
sent
not
long
ago
what
he
says
is
the
true
story
of
mary
and
her
lamb
hoping
it
will
take
the
place
of
the
garbled
version
hitherto
received
as
authentic
mary
had
a
little
lamb
whose
fleece
was
white
as
snow
and
every
place
that
mary
went
the
lamb
it
would
go
so
mary
took
that
little
lamb
and
beat
it
for
a
spell
the
family
had
it
fried
next
day
and
it
went
very
well
we
have
still
another
way
of
it
in
what
may
be
termed
an
exaggerated
synonymic
adherence
to
the
central
idea
of
the
ballad
mary
possessed
a
diminutive
sheep
whose
external
covering
was
as
devoid
of
colour
as
the
aqueous
fluid
which
sometimes
presents
unsurmountable
barriers
on
the
sierras
and
everywhere
mary
peregrinated
this
juvenile
southdown
would
be
sure
to
get
up
and
go
right
after
her
it
followed
her
to
the
alphabet
dispensary
one
day
which
was
contrary
to
the
subdivision
of
the
article
of
the
constitution
of
that
academy
of
erudition
it
caused
the
adolescent
disciples
there
assembled
to
titillate
their
risibles
and
indulge
in
interludes
of
sportive
hilarity
linguistic
renderings
of
many
of
these
ancient
songs
may
be
found
in
the
works
of
the
rev
francis

the
system
of
nomenclature
they
have
pursued
in

far
as
introducing
such
names
as
deptford
codrington
greenwich
and
so
on
conceding
that
there
may
be
some
confusion
by
the
duplication
in
this
way
of
names
from
the
old
country
they
are
surely
better
than
the
native
names
which
are
strung
together
in
the

lines

the
following
in

many
of
the
absurd
and
unpronounceable
names
of
american
towns
and
villages
are
happily
hit
off
is
from
the
by
newell
a
work
containing
many
of
those
humorous
effusions
which
were
so
common
in
the
united
states
during
the
civil
war
the
american
traveller
to
lake
aghmoogenegamook
all
in
the
state
of
maine
a
man
from
wittequergaugaum
came
one
evening
in
the
rain
am
a
traveller
said
he
started
on
a
tour
and
go
to
nomjamskillicook
morn
at
four
he
took
a
that
night
and
with
the
morrow
sun
by
way
of
sekledobskus
went
with
and
gun
a
week
passed
on
and
next
we
find
our
native
tourist
come
to
that
sequester
village
called
genasagarnagum
from
thence
he
went
to
absequoit
and
there
quite
tired
of
maine
he
sought
the
mountains
of
vermont
upon
a
railroad
train
dog
hollow
in
the
green
mount
state
was
his
first
and
then
skunk
misery
displayed
its
sweetness
and
its
grace
by
easy
stages
then
he
went
to
visit
devil
den
and
scrabble
hollow
by
the
way
did
come
within
his
ken
then
nine
holes
and
goose
green
he
travelled
through
the
state
and
to
virginia
finally
was
guided
by
his
fate
within
the
old
dominion
bounds
he
wandered
up
and
down
at
buzzard
roost
ensconced
at
hell
town
at
pole
cat
too
he
spent
a
week
till
friends
from
bull
ring
came
and
made
him
spend
the
day
with
them
in
hunting
forest
game
then
with
his
in
hand
to
dog
town
next
he
went
though
stopping
at
free
negro
town
where
half
a
day
he
spent
from
thence
into
negationburg
his
route
of
travel
lay
which
having
gained
he
left
the
state
and
took
a
southward
way
north
carolina
friendly
soil
he
trod
at
fall
of
night
and
on
a
bed
of
softest
down
he
slept
at
hell
delight
morn
found
him
on
the
road
again
to
lousy
level
bound
at
bull
tail
and
lick
lizard
too
good
provender
he
found
the
country
all
about
pinch
gut
so
beautiful
did
seem
that
the
beholder
thought
it
like
a
picture
in
a
dream
but
the
plantations
near
burnt
coat
were
even
finer
still
and
made
the
tourist
feel
a
soft
delicious
thrill
at
tear
shirt
too
the
scenery
most
charming
did
appear
with
snatch
it
in
the
distance
far
and
purgatory
near
but
spite
of
all
these
pleasant
scenes
the
tourist
stoutly
swore
that
home
is
brightest
after
all
and
travel
is
a
bore
so
back
he
went
to
maine
straightway
a
little
wife
he
took
and
now

great
professor
inter
that
in
peace
may
rest
his
bones
if
we
hew
him
a
rocky
sepulchre
he
rise
up
and
break
the
stones
and
examine
each
stratum
that
lies
around
for
he
quite
in
his
element
underground
if
with
mattock
and
spade
his
body
we
lay
in
the
common
alluvial
soil
he
start
up
and
snatch
those
tools
away
of
his
own
geological
toil
in
a
stratum
so
young
the
professor
disdains
that
embedded
should
be
his
organic
remains
then
exposed
to
the
drip
of
some
spring
his
carcase
let
stalactite
cover
and
to
oxford
the
petrified
sage
let
us
bring
when
he
is
encrusted
all
over
there
mid
mammoths
and
crocodiles
high
on
a
shelf
let
him
stand
as
a
monument
raised
to
himself
when
professor
buckland
grave
was
being
dug
in
islip
churchyard
in
august
the
men
came
unexpectedly
upon
the
solid
limestone
rock
which
they
were
obliged
to
blast
with
gunpowder
the
coincidence
of
this
fact
with
some
of
the
verses
in
the
above
anticipatory
dirge
is
somewhat
remarkable
the
following
is
by
jacob
henrici
and
appeared
originally
in
s
for
november
a
microscopic
serenade
oh
come
my
love
and
seek
with
me
a
realm
by
grosser
eye
unseen
where
fairy
forms
will
welcome
thee
and
dainty
creatures
hail
thee
queen
in
silent
pools
the
tube
i
ply
where
green
lie
curled
and
proudly
bring
to
thy
bright
eye
the
trophies
of
the
protist
world
we
rouse
the
stentor
from
his
lair
and
gaze
into
the
cyclops
eye
in
chara
and
nitella
hair
the
protoplasmic
stream
descry
for
ever
weaving
to
and
fro
with
faint
molecular
melody
and
curious
rotifers
i
show
and
graceful
vorticellidæ
where
melicertæ
ply
their
craft
we
watch
the
playful
and
no
envenomed
hydra
shaft
shall
mar
our
peaceful
pleasure
there
but
while
we
whisper
love
sweet
tale
we
trace
with
sympathetic
art
within
the
embryonic
snail
the
growing
rudimental
heart
where
rolls
the
volvox
sphere
of
green
and
plastids
move
in
brownian
dance
if
wandering
that
gentle
scene
two
fond
amoebæ
shall
perchance
be
changed
to
one
beneath
our
sight
by
process
of
biocrasis
we
recognise
with
rare
delight
a
type
of
our
prospective
bliss
oh
dearer
thou
by
far
to
me
in
thy
sweet
maidenly
estate
than
any
could
be
of
aperture
however
great
come
go
with
me
and
we
will
stray
through

grosser
eye
unseen
where
protophytes

homage
pay

ye

attend
how
the
hero
i
sing
was
foiled
by
a
girl
though
at
arms
he
was
king
and
knew
he
and
deeply
was
studied
in
old
pedigree
he
would
sit
a
whole
evening
and
not
without
rapture
tell
who
begat
who
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
in
forming
his
nought
grieved
him
so
sorely
that
the
man
died
or
else
at
last
having
traced
other
families
down
he
began
to
have
thoughts
of
increasing
his
own
a
damsel
he
chose
not
too
slow
of
belief
and
fain
would
be
deemed
her
admirer
he
his
suit
and
the
sum
of
his
tale
was
his
and
her
joined
per
in
different
style
to
tie
faster
the
noose
he
next
would
attack
her
in
soft
his
and
were
laid
aside
quite
plain
he
wrote
and
in
plain
black
and
white
against
such
what
beauty
could
fence
or
who
would
have
thought
it
was
all
but
his
pain
to
relieve
and
fulfil
his
desire
the
lady
agreed
to
join
hands
with
the
squire
the
squire
in
a
fret
that
the
jest
went
so
far
considered
with

how
to
put
in
a
his
words
bound
not
him
since
hers
did
not
confine
her
and
that
is
plain
law
because
miss
is
a
miss
briskly
replied
that
the
law
was
too
hard
if
she
who
a
may
not
be
a
in
law
then
confiding
she
took
it
upon
her
by
justice
to
mend
those
foul
breaches
of
honour
she
handled
him
so
that
few
would
i
warrant
have
been
in

so
an
errant
she
made
him
give

a
or
if
without

the
case

touch
on
let
this
be
set
down
as
a
in
his
lament
of
an
unfortunate
druggist
a
member
of
the
pharmaceutical
society
whose
matrimonial
speculations
have
been
disappointed
you
that
have

of

take
heed
to
keep
the
vessel
which
contains
it
so
that
no
oxygen
may
enter
there
lest
like
as
in
a
keg
of
elder
wine
the
which
when
made
thy
careless
hand
forgot
to
bung
securely
down
full
soon
alas
acetous
fermentation
supervene
and
winter
find
thee
wineless
and
instead
of
wine
afford
thee
nought
but
vinegar
thus
hath
it
been
with
me
there
was
a
time
when
neither
rosemary
nor
jessamine
cloves
or
verbena
maréchale
resedé
or
great
otto
self
were
more
delicious
unto
my
nose
than
betsy
to
mine
eyes
and
in
our
days
of
courtship
i
have
thought
that
my
career
through
life
with
her
would
be
bright
as
my
own
but
ah
me
it
was
a
vision
scene
from
what
she
to
what
she
is
as
the
pearliness
of
creta
præp
compared
with
antim
nig
there
was
a
time
she
was
all
a
bland
emulsion
i
can
recommend
it
to
him
who
hath
a
cold
but
now
woe
woe
she
is
a
fierce
and
foaming
combination
of
turpentine
with
vitriolic
oil
oh
name
not
sulphur
when
you
speak
of
her
for
she
is
brimstone
very
incarnation
she
is
the
of
my
life
the
scillæ
oxymel
of
my
existence
that
knows
no
sweets
with
her
what
shall
i
do
where
fly
what
hellebore
can
ease
the
madness
that
distracts
my
brain
what
aromatic
vinegar
restore
the
drooping
memory
of
brighter
days
they
bid
me
seek
relief
in
prussic
acid
they
tell
me
arsenic
holds
a
mighty
power
to
put
to
flight
each
ill
and
care
of
life
they
mention
opium
too
they
say
its
essence
called
battley
sedative
can
steep
the
soul
in
blest
imaginings
till
grief
changed
by
its
chemic
agency
becomes
one
lump
of
blessed
saccharum
these
things
they
tell
to
who
for
twelve
long
years
have
triturated
drugs
for
a
subsistence
from
seven
i
th
morn
until
the
midnight
hour
i
have
no
faith
in
physic
agency
when
most
for
i
have
seen
and
analysed
its
nature
and
i
know
that
humbug

its
active
principle
its
ultimate
and
elemental
basis
what
then
is
left
no

gazette
july
a

madrigal
i
have
found
out
a
gift
for
my
fair
i
know
where
the
fossils
abound
where
the
footprints
of
declare
the
birds
that
once
walked
on
the
ground
oh
come
and
in
technical
speech
we
walk
this
devonian
shore
or
on
some
silurian
beach
we
wander
my
love
evermore
i
will
show
thee
the
sinuous
track
by
the
annelid
made
or
the
trilobite
that
farther
back
in
the
old
potsdam
sandstone
was
laid
thou
shalt
see
in
his
jurassic
tomb
the
plesiosaurus
embalmed
in
his
oolitic
prime
and
his
bloom
iguanodon
safe
and
unharmed
you
wished
i
remember
it
well
and
i
loved
you
the
more
for
that
wish
for
a
perfect
cystedian
shell
and
a
holocephalic
fish
and
oh
if
earth
strata
contains
in
its
lowest
silurian
drift
or
palæozoic
remains
the
same
is
your
lover
free
gift
then
come
love
and
never
say
nay
but
calm
all
your
maidenly
fears
we
note
love
in
one
summer
day
the
record
of
millions
of
years
and
though
the
darwinian
plan
your
sensitive
feelings
may
shock
we
find
the

of

our
fossil

in

thy

utterly
sick
of
this
hateful
alliance
which
the
ladies
have
formed
with
impractical
science
they
put
out
their
washing
to
learn
hydrostatics
and
give
themselves
airs
for
the
sake
of
pneumatics
they
are

and
chlorine
while
the

gather
fast
on
the

the

the

pickles
fall
woefully
short
with
their
chemical
use
of
the
still

retort
our
expenses
increase
without
drinking
french
wines
for
they
keep
no
accounts
with
their
tangents
and
sines
and
to
make
both
ends
meet
they
give
little
assistance
with
their
accurate
sense
of
the
squares
of
the
distance
they
can
name
every
spot
from
peru
to
el
arish
except
just
the
bounds
of
their
own
native
parish
and
they
study
the
orbits
of
venus
and
saturn
while
their
home
is
resigned
to
the
thief
and
the
slattern
chronology
keeps
back
the

they
learn
motive
powers
flies
and
shells
swallow
up
all
our
everyday
gains

they
cease

with
their

they
drive
us
from

by
electric

and
i

since
they
bothered
their

with
affinity
i
repulsed
every

from
my

when
the
poor
stupid
husband
is
weary
and
starving
anatomy
leads
them
to
give
up

an

cumulative

and
other

that
which

very
common
in
american
newspapers
which
however
profound
or
dense
invariably
have
a
corner
for
this
kind
of
thing
it
has
been
said
that
the
reason
why
no

comic
paper
like

succeeds
in

is
because
all
their
papers
have
a

the
arab

an
arab
came
to
the
river
side
with
a
donkey
bearing
an
obelisk
but
he
would
not
try
to
ford
the
tide
for
he
had
too
good
an
so
he
camped
all
night
by
the
river
side
and
remained
till
the
tide
had
ceased
to
swell
for
he
knew
should
the
donkey
from
life
subside
he
never
would
find
its
when
the
morning
dawned
and
the
tide
was
out
the
pair
crossed
over
allah
protection
and
the
arab
was
happy
we
have
no
doubt
for
he
had
the
best
donkey
in
all
that
you
are
wrong
they
were
drowned
in
crossing
over
though
the
donkey
was
bravest
of
all
his
race
he
luxuriates
now
in
clover
and
his
master

gone

these

its

ever

our

all
their

guess
their

failing

sheridan
had
a
sort

fancy

to
that
sort
which
consists
in
rhyming
to
the

word
through
a
long
string
of
couplets
till
every
rhyme
that
the

supplies
for

john
skelton
a
poet
of
the
fifteenth
century
in
great
repute
as
a
wit
and
satirist
was
inordinately
fond
of
writing
in
lines
of
three
or
four
syllables
and
also
of
iteration
of
rhyme
this
perhaps
was
the
cause
of
his
writing
much
that
was
mere
doggerel
as
this
style
scarcely
admits
of
the
conveyance
of
serious
sentiment
occasionally
however
his
miniature
lines
are
interesting
as
in
this
address
to
margaret
hussey
merry
margaret
as
midsummer
flower
gentle
as
falcon
or

of

with

and

all
good
and
no
badness
so
joyously
so
maidenly
so
womanly
her
demeaning
in
everything
far
far
passing
that
i
can
indite
or
suffice
to
write
of
merry
margaret
as
midsummer

gentle
as

of

the

national
pasquinade

egerton
brydges
censura

written
in
commemoration
of
the
failure
of
spain
by
her
invincible
armada
to

britain
the
iteration
of
metre
is
all
that
approaches
in
it
to
the
style
of
skelton
of
whose
verse
it
is
an
imitation
a
skeltonical
salutation
or
condign
gratulation
at
the
just
vexation
of
the
spanish
nation

ninety

though
my

were

as

i

when

even
the

he

scarce
write
ninety

well
you

my
love
is
such
you
could
never
ask

much
yet
even
love
itself
declines
such

as
ninety

though
you
frowned
with
ninety
frowns
bribed
me
with
twice
ninety
towns
offered
me
the
starry
signs
i
could
not
write
ninety
lines
many
a
deed
i
boldly
done
since
my
race
of
life
begun
but
my
spirit
peaks
and
pines
when
it
thinks
of
ninety
lines
long
i
hope
for
thee
and
me
will
our
lease
of
this
world
be
but
though
hope
our
fate
entwines
death
will
come
ere
ninety

ninety

you

at

i
shall
pray
for
ninety

ninety
times
a
long
farewell
all
my
love
i
could
not
tell
though
was
multiplied
by
nines
ninety
times
these
ninety
lines
we
give
the
following
curious
old
ballad
a
place
here
not
only
on
account
of
the
iteration
of
rhyme
but
also
as
the
original
of
the
macaronic
verses
on
the
wig
and
the
hat
the
elderly
gentleman
here
with
his
cane
his
wig
and
his
hat
a
man
all
declare
but
then
he
with
fat
by
the
side
of
a
murmuring
stream
this
elderly
gentleman
sat
on
the
top
of
his
head
was
his
wig
and
of
his
wig
was
his
hat
the
wind
it
blew
high
and
blew
strong
as
this
elderly
gentleman
sat
and
bore
front
his
head
in
a
trice
and
plunged
in
the
river
his
hat
the
gentleman
then
took
his
cane
which
lay
on
his
lap
as
he
sat
and
dropped
in
the
river
his
wig
in
attempting
to
get
out
his
hat
cool
reflection
at
length
came
across
while
this
elderly
gentleman
sat
so
he
thought
he
would
follow
the
stream
and
look
for
his
fine
wig
and
hat
his
breast
it
grew
cold
with
despair
and
full
in
his
eye
madness
sat
so
he
flung
in
the
river
his
cane
to
swim
with
his
wig
and
his
hat
his
head
being
thicker
than
common
the
rest
of
his
fat
and
in
plunged
this
son
of
a
woman
to
follow
his
wig
cane
and
hat
a
newfoundland
dog
was
at
hand
no
circumstance
could
be
more
pat
the
old
man
he
brought
safe
to
land
then
fetched
out
his
wig
cane
and
hat
the
gentleman
dripping
and
cold
seem
much
like
a
rat
but
praised
his
deliverer
so
bold
then
adjusted
his
cane
wig
and
hat
now
homeward
the
gentleman
hied
but
neither
could
wear
wig
or
hat
the
dog
followed
close
at
his
side
fawn
waggled
his
tail
and
all
that
the
gentleman
filled
with
delight
the
dog
master
hastily
sought
two
guineas
set
all
things
to
right
for
that
sum
his
true
friend
he
bought
from
him
the
dog
never
would
part
but
lived
much
caressed
for
some
years
till
levelled
by
death
fatal
dart
when
the
gentleman
shed
many
tears
then
buried
poor
tray
in
the
green
and
placed
the
grave
a
small
stone
whereon
a
few
lines
may
be
seen
expressive
of
what
he
had
done
anagrams
are
curious
and
frequently
clever
examples
of
formal
literary
trifling
camden
in
his
remains
gave
to
the
world
a
treatise
showing
that
in
his
day
anagrams
were
endowed
with
an
undue
and
superstitious
importance
being
regarded
as
nothing
less
than
the
occult
and
mysterious
finger
of
fate
revealed
in
the
names
of
men
the
only
quintessence
says
this
old
writer
that
hitherto
the
alchemy
of
wit
could
draw
out
of
names
is
or
which
is
the
dissolution
of
a
name
truly
written
into
the
letters
as
its
elements
and
a
new
connection
of
it
by
artificial
transposition
without
addition
subtraction
or
change
of
any
letter
into
different
words
making
some
perfect
sense
applicable
to
the
person
named
precise
anagrammatists
adhere
strictly
to
these
rules
with
the
exception
of
omitting
or
retaining
the
letter
according
to
their
convenience
alleging
that
can
not
claim
the
rights
of
a
letter
others
again
think
it
no
injury
sometimes
to
use
for
for
for
for
and
contrariwise
and
several
of
the
instances
which
follow
will
be
found
variously
imperfect
camden
calls
the
charming
difficulty
of
making
an
anagram
the
whetstone
of
patience
to
them
that
shall
practise
it
for
some
have
been
seen
to
bite
their
pen
scratch
their
head
bend
their
brows
bite
their
lips
beat
the
board
tear
their
paper
when
the
names
were
fair
for
somewhat
and
caught
nothing
therein
yet
notwithstanding
the
sour
sort
of
critics
good
anagrams
yield
a
delightful
comfort
and
pleasant
motion
to
honest
minds
camden
places
the
origin
of
the
anagram
as
far
back
as
the
time
of
moses
and
conjectures
that
it
may
have
had
some
share
in
the
mystical
traditions
afterwards
called
the
cabala
communicated
by
the
jewish
lawgiver
one
part
of
the
art
of
the
cabalists
lay
in
what
they
called
that
is
changing
or
finding
the
hidden
and
mystical
meaning
in
names
which
they
did
by
transposing
and
fantastically
combining
the
letters
in
those
names
thus
of
the
letters
of
noah
name
in
hebrew
they
made
and
of
the
messiah
shall
whether
the
above
origin
be
theoretical
or
not
the
anagram
can
be
traced
to
the
age
of
lycophron
a
greek
writer
who
flourished
about
among
the
moderns
the
french
have
most
cultivated
the
anagram
camden
says
they
exceedingly
admire
the
anagram
for
the
deep
and
antiquity
and
mystical
meaning
therein
in
the
reign
of
francis
the
first
when
learning
began
to
revive
they
began
to
distil
their
wits
therein
there
is
a
curious
anecdote
of
an
anagrammatist
who
presented
a
king
of
france
with
the
two
following
upon
his
name
of
bourbon
borbonius
borbonius
or
that
is
bourbon
good
to
the
world
or
bourbon
destitute
of
good
while
on
another
celebrated
frenchman
we
have
voltaire
alte
southey
in
his
doctor
says
that
anagrams
are
not
likely
ever
again
to
hold
so
high
a
place
among
the
prevalent
pursuits
of
literature
as
they
did
in
the
seventeenth
century
but
no
person
he
continues
will
ever
hit
upon
an
apt
one
without
feeling
that
degree
of
pleasure
with
which
any
odd
coincidence
is
remarked
in
that
century
indeed
the
artifice
appears
to
have
become
the
fashionable
literary
passion
of
the
day
the
amusement
of
the
learned
and
the
wise
who
sought
to
purchase
fame
in
keen
iambics
and
mild
anagram
while
andreas
rudiger
was
yet
a
student
at
college
and
intending
to
become
a
physician
he
one
day
pulled
the
latinised
form
of
his
name
to
pieces
andreas
rudigeras
and
borrowing
an
transposed
it
into
rus
dei
worthy
to
cultivate
the
land
of
god
he
fancied
from
this
that
he
had
a
divine
call
to
become
an
ecclesiastic
and
thereupon
gave
up
the
study
of
medicine
for
theology
soon
after
rudiger
became
tutor
in
the
family
of
the
philosopher
thomasius
who
one
day
told
him
that
he
would
greatly
benefit
the
journey
of
his
life
by
turning
it
towards
physic
rudiger
confessed
that
his
tastes
lay
rather
in
that
direction
than
to
theology
but
having
looked
upon
the
anagram
of
his
name
as
an
indication
of
a
divine
call
he
had
not
dared
to
turn
away
from
theology
how
simple
you
have
been
replied
thomasius
it
is
just
that
very
anagram
which
calls
you
towards
medicine
the
land
of
god
god
acre
what
is
that
but
the
cemetery
and
who
labours
so
bravely
for
the
cemetery
as
a
physician
does
rudiger
could
not
resist
this
returned
to
medicine
and
became
famous
as
a
physician

in
this
anagram
the
takes
the
place
of
the
the
old
puritan
biographer
cotton
mather
claims
for
john
wilson
the
subject
of
one
of
his
lives
the
kingship
of
anagrammatising
of
all
the
anagrammatisers
he
says
in
the
third
book
of
his
magnalia
christi
americana
that
have
been
trying
their
fancies
for
the
years
that
have
run
out
since
the
days
of
lycophron
or
the
more
than
since
the
days
of
our
first
father
i
believe
there
never
was
a
man
that
made
so
many
or
so
nimbly
as
our
wilson
who
together
with
his
quick
turns
upon
the
names
of
his
friends
would
ordinarily
and
rather
than
would
even
devout
instructions
out
of
his
anagrams
as
one
upon
hearing
my
father
increase
mather
preach
wilson
immediately
gave
him
that
anagram
upon
his
name
matherus
christus
merces
lo
christ
is
thy
reward
there
would
scarcely
occur
the
name
of
any
remarkable
person
without
an
anagram
raised
thereupon
this
said
john
wilson
forced
instruction
out
of
his
own
name
first
rendering
it
into
latin
johannes
wilsonus
he
found
this
anagram
in
it
uno
jesu
nos
we
are
saved
in
one
jesus
this
mode
of
latinising
names
was
common
enough
among
those
who
liked
this
literary
folly
thus
we
have
sir
robert
viner
or
robertus
vinerus
rendered
bonus
et
a
good
and
rare
man
the
disciples
of
descartes
made
a
perfect
anagram
upon
the
latinised
name
of
their
master
renatus
cartesius
one
which
not
only
takes
up
every
letter
but
which
also
expresses
their
opinion
of
that
master
speciality
scis

pierre
de
louis
became
a
carmelite
monk
on
discovering
that
his
name
yielded
a
direction
to
that
effect
ludovicus
bartelemi
se
and
in
the
seventeenth
century
andré
pujom
finding
that
his
name
spelled
à
fulfilled
his
destiny
by
cutting
somebody
throat
in
auvergne
and
was
actually
hung
at
riom
the
seat
of
justice
in
that
province
occasionally
when
the
anagram
of
a
name
did
not
make
sense
there
was
added
a
rhyme
to
bring
out
a
meaning
thus
in
a
sermon
preached
by
edward
reynolds
upon
peter
whalley
and
entitled
death
advantage
every
letter
of
the
name
is
to
be
found
in
the
first
line
of
this
verse
reap
that
heaven
obtain
who
sow
like
thee
sow
in
vain
in
this
sermon
peter
whalley
is
also
anagrammatised
into
whyte
this
would
not
be
a
bad
one
if
orthography
were
of
as
little
consequence
as
many
of
the
old
triflers
in
this
way
used
to
account
it
we
read
that
when
alexander
the
great
was
baffled
before
the
walls
of
tyre
and
was
about
to
raise
the
siege
he
had
a
dream
wherein
he
saw
a
satyr
leaping
about
and
trying
to
seize
him
he
consulted
his
sages
who
read
in
the
word
satyrus
the
greek
for
satyr
tyre
is
thine
encouraged
by
this
interpretation
alexander
made
another
assault
and
carried
the
city
in
a
new
help
to
discourse
london
there
is
one
with
a
very
quaint
exposition
toast
a
sott
a

like
or
what
is
most
comparative
is
like
a
for
when
their
substances
in
liquor
sink
both
properly
are
said
to
be
in
drink
it
will
be
seen
however
that
anagrams
have
chiefly
been
made
upon
proper
names
and
a
reversing
of
their
letters
may
sometimes
pay
the
owner
a
compliment
as
of
the
poet
waller
his
brows
with
laurel
need
not
to
be
bound
since
in
his
with
he
is
crowned
george
thompson
the
advocate
was
at
one
time
solicited
to
go
into
parliament
for
the
more
efficient
serving
of
the
cause
he
had
so
much
at
heart
the
question
whether
he
would
comply
with
this
request
or
not
was
submitted
to
his
friends
and
one
of
them
gave
the
following
for
answer
george
thompson
go
the
negro
this
clever
instance
was
given
in
notes
and
queries
a
short
time
ago

the
following
are
additional
instances

at
the

of
prussia
absorbed
a
portion
of

the
king
issued
a
new
coinage
of
rix
dollars
with
their
german
name
impressed
on
them
the

by

the

remaining

and
this
may
be
regarded
as
an
extraordinary
coincidence
if
nothing
more
many
anagrams
were
made
upon
the
name
of
napoleon
by
superstitious
persons
as

you

what
bad
folks
are
again
if
you
transpose
the
same
you
see
an
ancient
hebrew

change

again
and
it
will
show
what
all
on

desire
to
do

acrostic
is
the
greek
name
given
to
a
poem
the
first
letters
of
the
lines
in
which
taken
together
form
a
complete
word
or
sentence
but
most
frequently
a
name
the
invention
of
this
kind
of
composition
can
not
be
traced
to
any
particular
individual
but
it
is
believed
to
have
originated
on
the
decline
of
pure
classic
literature
the
early
french
poets
from
the
time
of
francis
to
that
of
louis
practised
it
but
it
was
carried
to
its
greatest
perfection
by
the
elizabethan
poets
sir
john
davies
has
no
fewer
than
poems
entitled
hymns
to
astræa
every
one
of
which
is
an
acrostic
on
the
words
elizabetha
regina
traces
of
something
akin
are
to
be
found
in
the
poetry
of
the
jews
for
example
the
psalm
and
also
in
the
greek
anthology
here
it
may
be
noted
that
in
greek
the
word
is
compounded
of
the
initial
letters
of
the
four
cardinal
points
arktos
north
dusis
west
anatolê
east
mesembria
south
and
that
the
hebrew
word
adm
forms
the
acrostic
of
a
dam
d
avid
m
essiah
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
give
many
specimens
of
this
kind
of
literary
composition
in
these
days
since
there
are
so
many
periodicals
continually
giving
acrostics
and
relative
verses
and
a
very
few
instances
may
suffice
the
following
old
verses
were
originally
written
in
a
copy
of

by

swinburne
of
whose
style
there
has
been

an
imitation
is
not
the
only
poet
who
is
prone
to
alliteration
in
fact
all
poets
are
given
more
or
less
to
it
though
not
to
the
same
extent
when
used
excessively
it
is
as
disagreeable
as
any
other
excess
yet
its
occasional
use
unquestionably
adds
to
grace
and
style
pope
says
on
this
point
in
the
following
lines
which
are
also
alliterative
is
not
enough
no
harshness
gives
offence
the
sound
must
seem
an
echo
to
the
sense
soft
is
the
strain
when
zephyr

blows
and
the
smooth
stream
in
smoother
numbers
flows
but
when
loud
surges
lash
the

the

should
like
the

roar

find
this
example
in

there
behold
the

the

that
faintly

slowly
run
the

also

teach
me
half

gladness
that
my

flow
the

should
listen

thou

for

there
appeared
a

the

with
the
remark
that

the
finest
and
daintiest
nonsense
he
ever
read
thy

like
some
icy
lake
on

cold
brink
i
stand
oh
buckle
on
my
spirit
skate
and
lead
thou
living
saint
the
way
to
where
the
ice
is
thin
that
it
may
break
beneath
my
feet
and
let
a
lover
in
a
short
time
ago
in
the
new
series
of
a
prize
was
offered
for
the
writing
of
nonsense
verses
of
eight
lines
of
the
lines
sent
in
by
the
competitors
we
give
three
specimens
how
many
strive
to
force
a
way
where
none
can
go
save
those
who
pay
to
verdant
plains
of
soft
delight
the
homage
of
the
silent
night
when
countless
stars
from
pole
to
pole
around
the
earth
unceasing
roll
in
roseate
shadow
silvery
hue
shine
forth
and
gild
the
morning
dew
and
must
we
really
part
for
good
but
meet
again
here
where
we
stood
no
more
delightful
we
watched
sweet
nature
smiling
face
no
more
the
landscape

our
mutual
breathing
vow
then
should
the
twilight
draw
around
no
loving
interchange
of
sound
less
for
renown
than
innate
love
these
to
my
wish
must
recreant
prove
nor
whilst
an
impulse
here
remain
can
ever
hope
the
soul
to
gain
for
memory
scanning
all
the
past

her
firm
bonds
at
last
and
gives
to
candour
all
the
grace
the
heart
can
in
its
temple
trace
spiro
the
curious
style
of
some
versifiers
has
been
well
imitated
in
the
following
ballad
of
the
period
an
auld
wife
sat
at
her
ivied
door
and
eggs
and
a
pound
of
a
thing
she
had
frequently
done
before
and
her
knitting
reposed
on
her
aproned
knees
the
piper
he
piped
on
the
high
and
eggs
and
a
pound
of
till
the
cow
said
die
and
the
goose
said
and
the
dog
said
nothing
but
searched
for
fleas
the
farmer
daughter
hath
soft
brown
hair
and
eggs
and
a
pound
of
and
i
met
a
ballad
i
ca
tell
where
which
mainly
consisted
of
lines
like
these
gilbert
has
some
verses
which
are
true
nonsense
of
which
this
is
one
sing
for
the
garish
eye
when
moonless
brandlings
cling
let
the
froddering
crooner
cry
and
the
braddled
sapster
sing
for
never
and
never
again

lewis
carroll
hunting
of
the
snark
is
a
very
curious
little
book
full
of
the
most
delicate
fun
and
queer
nonsense
with
delightful
illustrations
it
gives
an
account
of
how
a
bellman
boots
barrister
broker
banker
beaver
baker
and
butcher
go
after
a
mythical
beast
called
a
snark
it
is
difficult
to
detach
a
passage
for
quotation
but
the
following
few
lines
will
show
how
the
quest
of
the
snark
was
purposed
to
be
carried
on
to
seek
it
with
thimbles
to
seek
it
with
care
to
pursue
it
with
forks
and
hope
to
threaten
its
life
with
a
railway
share
to
charm
it
with
smiles
and
soap
for
the
snark
a
peculiar
creature
that
be
caught
in
a
commonplace
way
do
all
that
you
know
and
try
all
that
you
do
not
a
chance
must
be
wasted
the
verses
which
follow
are
from
the
comic
latin
grammar
and
if
they
are
not
nonsense
they
show
at
least
how
thin
the
partition
line
is
between
true
nonsense
verse
and
many
of
those
pieces
which
were
wont
to
be
known
by
the
name
of
album
verses
lines
by
a
fond
lover
lovely
maid
with
rapture
swelling
should
these
pages
meet
thine
eye
clouds
of
absence
soft
dispelling
vacant
memory
heaves
a
sigh
as
the
rose
with
fragrance
weeping
trembles
to
the
tuneful
wave
so
my
heart
shall
twine
unsleeping
till
it
canopies
the
grave
though
another
smile
requited
envious
fate
my
doom
should
be
joy
for
ever
disunited
think
ah
think
at
times
on
me
oft
amid
the
spicy
gloaming
where
the
brakes
their
songs
instil
fond
affection
silent
roaming
loves
to
linger
by
the
rill
there
when
echo

the

no

a
lamb
has
managèd
his
rhymes
to
fit
and
haply
fancies
he
has
writ
another
memoriam
how
his
intended
gathered
flowers
and
took
her
tea
and
after
sung
is
told
in
style
somewhat
like
ours
for
delectation
of
the
young
but
reader
lest
you
say
we
quiz
the
poet
record
of
his
she
some
little
pictures
you
shall
see
not
in
our
language
but
in
his
thus
i
grieved
and
kissed
her
glove
my
man
brought
in
her
note
to
say
papa
had
bid
her
send
his
love
and
hoped
i
dine
with
them
next
day
they
had
learned
and
practised
purcell
glee
to
sing
it
by
night
the
postscript
was
her
sisters
and
she
inclosed
some
violets
blue
and
white
and
sick
of
long
exile
from
those
sweet
friends
i
rode
to
see
the
church
repairs
and
after
a
while
waylaying
the
dean
was
asked
to
tea
they
introduced
the
cousin
fred
i
heard
of
honor
favourite
grave
dark
handsome
bluff
but
gently
bred
and
with
an
air
of
the
salt
wave
fear
not
this
saline
cousin
fred
he
gives
no
tragic
mischief
birth
there
are
no
tears
for
you
to
shed
unless
they
may
be
tears
of
mirth
from
ball
to
bed
from
field
to
farm
the
tale
flows
nicely
purling
on
with
much
conceit
there
is
no
harm
in
the
here
begun
the
rest
will
come
another
day
if
public
sympathy
allows
and
this
is
all
we
have
to
say
about
the
in
the
house
the
printer
the
had
just
set
up
a
of
brevier
filled
with
italic
fractions
signs
and
other
things
most
queer
the
type
he
lifted
from
the
stick
nor
dreamt
of
coming
woes
when
lo
a
wretched
wasp
thought
fit
to
sting
him
on
the
nose
the
the
type
let
fall
as
quick
as
quick
could
be
and
gently
murmured
a
naughty
word
beginning
with
a
my
love
i
seen
her
out
in
her
habit
de
la
rue
and
it
ai
no
use
but
she
pumpkins
and
a
few
she
glides
along
in
glory
like
a
duck
upon
a
lake
and
i
be
all
love
and
duty
if
i
only
were
her
drake
the
solo
he
drew
his
breath
with
a
gasping
sob
with
a
quivering
voice
he
sang
but
his
voice
leaked
out
and
could
not
drown
the
clamorous
bang
he
lost
his
pitch
on
the
middle
a
he
faltered
on
the
lower
d
and
foundered
at
length
like
a
battered
wreck
adrift
on
the
wild
high
pony
lost
this
devil
bade
me
lost
stolen
or
astray
not
the
least
doubt
but
run
away
a
mare
pony
that
is
all
bay
if
i
judge
pretty
nigh
it
is
about
eleven
hands
high
full
tail
and
mane
a
pretty
head
and
frame
cut
on
both
shoulders
by
the
collar
not
being
soft
nor
hollow
it
is
about
five
years
old
which
may
be
easily
told
for
spirit
and
for
speed
the
devil
can
not
her
exceed
an
excellent
specimen
of
this
kind
of
literary
work
is
to
be
found
in
russell
lowell
fable
for
critics
of
which
the
and
preface
are
written
in
this
fashion
and
there
is
here
given
an
extract
from
the
latter
having
scrawled
at
full
gallop
as
far
as
that
goes
in
a
style
that
is
neither
good
verse
nor
bad
prose
and
being
a
person
whom
nobody
knows
some
people
will
say
i
am
rather
more
free
with
my
readers
than
it
is
becoming
to
be
that
i
seem
to
expect
them
to
wait
on
my
leisure
in
following
wherever
i
wander
at
pleasure
that
in
short
i
take
more
than
a
young
author
lawful
ease
and
laugh
in
a
queer
way
so
like
mephistopheles
that
the
public
will
doubt
as
they
grope
through
my
rhythm
if
in
truth
i
am
making
fun
them
or
them
so
the
excellent
public
is
hereby
assured
that
the
sale
of
my
book
is
already
secured
for
there
is
not
a
poet
throughout
the
whole
land
but
will
purchase
a
copy
or
two
out
of
hand
in
the
fond
expectation
of
being
amused
in
it
by
seeing
his
betters
cut
up
and
abused
in
it
now
i
find
by
a
pretty
exact
calculation
there
are
something
like
ten
thousand
bards
in
the
nation
of
that
special
variety
whom
the
review
and
magazine
critics
call
and
and
about
thirty
thousand
tribe
is
increasing
of
the
kinds
who
are
termed
of
and
the
public
will
see
by
a
glance
at
this
schedule
that
they
can
not
expect
me
to
be
about
courting
since
it
seems
i
have
got
enough
fuel
made
sure
of
for
boiling
my
pot
as
for
such
of
our
poets
as
find
not
their
names
mentioned
once
in
my
pages
with
praises
or
blames
let
them
send
in
their
cards
without
further
delay
to
my
friend
putnam
esquire
in
broadway
where
a
list
will
be
kept
with
the
strictest
regard
to
the
day
and
the
hour
of
receiving
the
card
then
taking
them
up
as
i
chance
to
have
time
that
is
if
their
names
can
be
twisted
in
rhyme
i
will
honestly
give
each
his
proper
position
at
the
rate
of
one
author
to
each
new
edition
thus
a
premium
is
offered
sufficiently
high
as
the
magazines
say
when
they
tell
their
best
lie
to
induce
bards
to
club
their
resources
and
buy
the
balance
of
every
edition
until
they
have
all
of
them
fairly
been
run
through
the
mill
that
which
is
considered
however
one
of
the
best
of
prose
poems
is
the
following
which
appeared
originally
in
and
will
also
be
found
in
maclise
and
maginn
gallery
of
illustrious
literary
characters
being
part
of
the
introductory
portion
of
a
notice
of
the
late
earl
of
beaconsfield
then
disraeli
and
known
at
the
time
as
an
aspirant
to
literary
and
political
fame
o
reader
dear
do
pray
look
here
and
you
will
spy
the
curly
hair
and
forehead
fair
and
nose
so
high
and
gleaming
eye
of
benjamin
the
wondrous
boy
who
wrote
in
rhyme
and
prose
only
to
show
how
long
ago
victorious
judah
rose
in
an
earlier
day
he
wrote
a
smart
enough
story
we
must
say
until
he
took
his
hero
abroad
and
trundled
him
over
the
german
road
and
taught
him
there
not
to
drink
beer
and
swallow
schnapps
and
pull
mädschen
caps
and
smoke
the
cigar
and
the
meersham
true
in
alehouse
and
lusthaus
all
fatherland
through
until
all
was
blue
but
talk
secondhand
that
which
at
the
first
was
never
many
degrees
from
the
worst
namely
german
cant
and
high
dutch
sentimentality
maudlin
metaphysics
and
rubbishing
reality
but
those
who
would
find
how
vivian
wined
with
the
marchioness
of
puddledock
and
other
great
grandees
of
the
kind
and
how
he
talked
æsthetic
and
waxed
eloquent
and
pathetic
and
kissed
his
italian
puppies
of
the
greyhound
breed
they
have
only
to
read
if
the
work
be
still
alive
vivian
grey
in
volumes
five
as
for
his
tentative
upon
the
which
he
and
john
murray
got
up
in
a
very
great
hurry
we
shall
say
nothing
at
all
either
great
or
small
and
all
the
wars
that
thence
ensued
and
the
moravian
deadly
feud
nor
much
of
that
fine
book
which
is
called
young
duke
with
his
slippers
of
velvet
blue
with
clasps
of
hue
made
out
of
the
pearl
mother
or
some
equally
fine
thing
or
other
and
which
will
cost
ye
but
a
guinea
and
get
through
it
can
you
in
which
he
made
war
on
assisted
by
a
whiskered
baron
his
name
was
von
haber
whose
germanical
jabber
master
ben
with
ready
pen
put
into
english
smart
and
jinglish
king
philippe
and
his
court
and
many
other
great
works
of
the
same
sort
why
we
leave
them
to
the
reader
to
peruse
that
is
to
say
if
he
should
choose
he
lately
stood
for
wycombe
but
there
colonel
grey
did
lick
him
he
being
parcel
tory
and
parcel
radical
which
is
what
in
general
mad
we
call
and
the
latest
affair
of
his
we
chanced
to
see
is
is
he
a
question
which
by
this
time
we
have
somewhat
answered
in
this
our
pedestrian
rhyme
as
for
the
rest
but
writing
rhyme
is
after
all
a
pest
and
therefore
odds
and
some
years
ago
gave
revised
versions
of
a
few
of
the
old
popular
songs
and
referring
to
the
one
we
have
chosen
as
a
specimen
says
that
its
simplicity
its
truthfulness
and
above
all
its
high
moral
have
recommended
it
to
him
for
selection
it
is
well
known
to
the
million
of
whose
singing
indeed
it
forms
a
part
perhaps
it
will
be
recognised
perhaps
not
a
polished
poem
if
i
had
a
donkey
vot
vould
go
do
you
think
i
wallop
had
i
an
ass
averse
to
speed
thou
i
strike
him
no
indeed
mark
me
i
try
persuasion
art
for
cruelty
offends
my
heart
had
all
resembled
me
i
ween
martin
thy
law
had
needless
been
of
speechless
brutes
from
blows
to
screen
the
poor
head
for
had
i
an
ass
averse
to
speed
i
would
strike
him
no
indeed
i
give
him
hay
and
cry
and
on
edward
why
speak
i
thus
this
very
morn
i
saw
that
cruel
william
burn
whilst
crying
upon
his
course
assail
his
ass
with
all
his
force
he
smote
him
the
head
and
thighs
till
tears
bedimmed
the
creature
eyes
oh
was
too
much
my
blood
rise
and
i
exclaimed
i
an
burn
turn
and
cried
with
scornful
eye
one
of
martin
fry
and
occasion
base
to
take
the
vile
informer
gain
to
make
word
of
denial
though
i
spoke
full
on
my
brow
his
fury
broke
and
thus
while
i
return
the
stroke
i
exclaimed
i
an
to
us
infringing
thus
the
peace
approach
his
guardians
the
police
and
like
inevitable
fate
bore
us
to
where
stern
justice
sate
her
minister
the
tale
i
told
and
to
support
my
word
made
bold
to
crave
he
would
the
ass
behold
i
declared
i
an
they
called
the
creature
into
court
where
sooth
to
say
he
made
some
sport
with
ears
erect
and
parted
jaws
as
though
he
strove
to
plead
his
cause
i
gained
the
palm
of
feelings
kind
the
ass
was
righted
william
fined
for
justice
one
with
me
in
mind
exclaimed
by
her
minister
i
an
cried
william
to
his
judge
tis
hard
think
not
the
fine
that
i
regard
but
things
have
reached
a
goodly
pass
one
may
not
beat
a
stubborn
ass
nought
spoke
the
judge
but
closed
his
book
so
william
thence
the
creature
took
eyeing
me
ah
with
what
a
look
as
gently
whispering
in
his
ear
i
said
had
i
an
cumulative
parodying
there
was
a
young
damsel
oh
bless
her
it
cost
very
little
to
dress
her
she
was
sweet
as
a
rose
in
her
everyday
clothes
but
had
no
young
man
to
caress
her
there
was
a
young
turkey
oh
bless
her
it
cost
very
little
to
dress
her
some
dry
bread
and
thyme
about
thanksgiving
time
and
they
ate
the
last
bit
from
the
dresser
a
newspaper
poet
oh
dang
him
and
pelt
him
and
club
him
and
bang
him
he
kept
writing
away
till
the
people
one
day
rose
up
and
proceeded
to
hang
him

to

in
a
certain
fair
island
for

renown
whose
fleets
sailed
in
every
sea
a
set
of
fanatics
men
say
there
was
found
who
set
up
an
island
and
worship
around
and
called
it
by
name
elessdé
many
heads
had
the
monster
and
tails
not
a
few
of
divers
rare
metals
was
he
and
temples
they
built
him
right
goodly
to
view
where
oft
they
would
meet
and
like
idolists
true
pay
their
vows
to
the
great
elessdé
moreover
at
times
would
their
frenzy
attain
was
nought
less
to
so
high
a
degree
that
his
votaries
did
not
complain

laid
down
their
lives
his
false
favour
to

so
great
was
thy
power
elessdé
as
for

this
somewhat
unscrupulous
race

professional
grace

of

fell
deed

fiend
elessdé
then
forgery
flourished

rampant
and
rife
was
each
form
of
diablerie
while
the
midnight
assassin
with
mallet
and
knife
would
steal
on
his
victim
and
rob
him
of
life

all
for
thy
love
elessdé
there
were
giants
of
crime
on
the
earth

day

this
is
a
new
volume
of
the
popular
mayfair
library
and
it
well
deserves
its
place
in
such
a
book
selection
and
arrangement
are
everything
dobson
really
knows
what
to
choose
and
what
to
reject
he
has
also
a
feeling
for
good
arrangement
and
has
made
a
most
attractive
volume
for
an
odd
or
for
a
long
journey
we
could
hardly
imagine
anything
better
and
we
trust
the
book
may
find
the
encouragement
it
so
well
deserves
quarterly
frivolities
is
an
absolutely
delightful
companion
for
an
unoccupied
it
is
a
book
which
may
with
equal
pleasure
be
read
all
through
or
dipped
into
at
any
point
and
the
collection
of
literary
triflings
it
supplies
is
admirably
ample
this
is
a
pleasant
and
amusing
little
volume
it
contains
a
great
deal
of
curious
information
and
shows
a
very
creditable
amount
of
research
we
may
end
as
we
began
by
commending
frivolities
as
a
capital
book
of
its
sort
this
latest
volume
of
the
bright
little
library
is
an
entertaining
contribution
to
the
literature
of
hours
and
will
sufficiently
initiate
its
readers
into
all
the
mysteries
of
palindromes
lipograms
centones
and
figurate
poems
and
a
more
delightful
little
work
it
has
seldom
been
our
lot
to
take
in
hand
dobson
has
made
a
study
of
all
the
eccentricities
and
frivolities
which
have
from
time
to
time
been
perpetrated
by
writers
in
prose
and
verse
dobson
had
gone
into
his
work
in
a
catholic
spirit
and
has
done
it
with
great
neatness
and
ability
it
would
be
difficult
to
commend
the
book
too
highly
it
is
a
volume
alike
for
holiday
purposes
and
for
other
purposes
more
serious
in
connection
with
literature
dobson
has
done
his
work
well
the
book
is
very
interesting
and
entertaining
and
has
a
still
higher
claim
to
our
regard
as
a
curious
chapter
in
the
history
of
literature
not
a
few
of
the
pages
will
raise
a
hearty
laugh
and
this
fact
alone
disposes
us
to
regard
the
book
with
marked
favour
a
good
index
has
not
been
forgotten
and
the
volume
in
all
ways
reflects
high
credit
on
its
author
this
is
a
queer
collection
of
interesting
nothings
a
record
of
some
of
the
literary
playthings
wherewith
men
have
sought
at
one
time
and
another
to
beguile
the
road
towards
the
darkness
here
are
quips
and
cranks
strange
forms
of
prose
and
verse
monstrosities
of
rhythms
it
is
all
very
interesting
and
shows
a
heavy
amount
of
research
on
the
part
of
the
compiler
great
fun
is
shown
in
almost
every
page
of
the
library
will
do
well
if
it
gives
us
many
books
like
mr
dobson
it
is
quite
certain
that
there
have
been
thousands
of
not
only
intelligent
but
grave
and
learned
persons
who
have
taken
pride
as
well
as
pleasure
in
the
accomplishment
of
such
exploits
and
that
there
are
tens
of
thousands
who
will
be
greatly
entertained
if
not
roused
to
emulation
by
the
pretty
little
volume
consecrated
to
the
commemoration
and
to
illustrative
samples
of
those
exploits
it
is
provided
with
an
index
a
very
useful
addition
and
it
is
undoubtedly
a
bright
amusing
and
not
altogether
uninstructive
publication
london
dobson
deserves
credit
for
the
pains
he
has
taken
a
miscellaneous
and
highly
amusing
collection
of
literary
curiosities
an
amusing
volume
an
account
of
a
great
many
of
those
curious
puzzles
and
tasks
in
which
the
literary
mind
delights
a
collection
a
most
exhaustive
one
of
the
vagaries
indulged
in
from
remote
ages
down
to
the
present
day
by
literary
triflers
a
very
entertaining
little
book
exceedingly
interesting
and
may
be
heartily
recommended
a
capital
little
book
a
cheap
and
neat
volume
which
no
editor
or
printer
should
be
without
times
and
one
of
the
most
quaintly
amusing
books
we
have
seen
for
a
long
time
evening
for
a
man
or
woman
endowed
with
literary
tastes
and
who
for
want
of
regular
work
to
do
sometimes
longs
for
new
methods
of
time
this
collection
of
frivolities
and
oddities
might
prove
a
fruitful
source
of
amusement
its
author
is
a
scholarly
and
man
and
in
preparing
this
book
he
must
have
put
himself
to
an
infinitude
of
pains
daily
the
little
volume
is
pleasantly
and
