the
come
let
us
go
and
be
glad
again
together
where
of
old
our
eyes
were
opened
and
we
knew
that
we
were
free
come
for
it
is
april
and
her
hands
have
loosed
the
tether
that
has
bound
for
long
her
her
children
more
than
we
hark
hear
you
not
how
the
strong
waters
thunder
down
through
the
alders
with
the
word
they
have
to
bring
even
now
they
win
the
meadow
and
the
withered
turf
is
under
and
above
the
willows
quiver
with
foreknowledge
of
the
spring
yea
they
come
and
joy
in
coming
for
the
giant
hills
have
sent
the
hills
that
guard
the
portal
where
the
south
has
built
her
throne
unloitering
their
course
is
wayside
pools
content
them
who
were
born
where
old
pine
forests
for
the
sea
forever
moan
and
they
behind
the
hills
where
forever
bloom
the
flowers
so
they
ever
know
the
worship
of
the
earth
do
their
hands
ever
clasp
such
a
happiness
as
ours
now
the
waters
foam
about
us
and
the
grasses
have
their
birth
fair
is
their
land
fair
beyond
all
dreaming
with
its
sun
upon
the
roses
and
its
long
summer
day
yet
surely
they
must
envy
us
our
vision
of
the
gleaming
of
our
white
throat
as
she
comes
her
ancient
way
for
their
year
is
never
what
were
time
without
her
yea
the
drifted
snows
may
cover
us
yet
shall
we
not
complain
knowing
well
our
lady
her
raiment
blown
about
will
return
with
many
kisses
for
our
unremembered
pain
ii
road
song
in
o
come
is
it
not
surely
may
the
year
is
at
its
poise
today
northward
i
hear
the
distant
beat
of
irrevocable
feet
tomorrow
june
will
have
her
way
o
tawny
waters
flecked
with
sun
come
for
your
labours
all
are
done
the
grey
snow
fadeth
from
the
hills
and
toward
the
sound
of
waking
mills
swing
the
brown
rafts
in
one
by
one
o
bees
among
the
forget
your
empty
waxen
rooms
awhile
and
share
our
golden
hours
will
they
not
come
the
later
flowers
with
their
old
colours
and
perfumes
o
wind
that
bloweth
from
the
west
is
not
this
morning
road
the
best
us
go
hand
in
hand
as
free
and
glad
as
little
children
be
that
follow
some
quest
iii
it
well
may
be
just
as
you
say
will
carver
that
your
tales
are
true
yet
think
what
i
must
put
away
will
carver
if
sail
with
you
if
you
should
sail
with
me
the
wind
is
west
the
at
full
my
men
the
things
that
you
have
left
behind
will
be
as
nothing
to
you
then
inland
june
and
birds
sing
among
the
wooded
hills
i
know
between
green
fields
unhastening
the
shadowed
waters
flow
what
know
you
of
such
things
as
these
who
have
the
grey
sea
at
your
door
whose
path
is
as
the
strong
winds
please
beyond
this
narrow
strip
of
shore
fields
and
woods
now
answer
me
up
what
green
path
have
your
feet
run
so
wide
as
mine
when
the
deep
sea
lies
to
the
sun
and
down
the
hollows
of
what
hills
have
you
so
glad
of
heart
as
you
shall
be
when
our
sail
fills
and
the
great
waves
ride
far
apart
o
half
your
life
is
good
to
live
will
carver
yet
if
i
should
go
what
are
the
things
that
you
can
give
lest
i
regret
the
things
i
know
lest
i
desire
the
old
way
the
noises
of
the
crowded
town
the
busy
streets
where
night
and
day
the
traffickers
go
up
and
down
what
can
i
give
for
these
alas
that
all
unchanged
your
path
must
be
strange
lights
shall
open
as
we
pass
and
alien
wakes
traverse
the
sea
your
ears
shall
hear
across
your
sleep
new
hails
remote
disquieted
for
not
a
of
the
deep
but
has
to
soothe
some
restless
dead
these
things
shall
be
and
other
things
i
think
not
quite
so
sad
as
these
you
the
song
the
rigging
sings
when
up
the
seas
the
slow
comes
amorously
the
sudden
gleam
of
some
far
sail
going
the
same
glad
way
as
we
hastily
lest
the
good
wind
fail
the
dreams
that
come
so
strange
so
fair
when
all
your
world
lies
well
within
the
moving
magic
circle
where
the
sea
ends
and
the
skies
begin
what
port
is
that
so
far
astern
will
carver
and
how
many
miles
shall
we
have
run
ere
the
tide
turn
is
it
far
to
the
farthest
isles
iv
just
where
the
field
becomes
the
wood
i
thought
i
saw
again
her
old
remembered
grey
as
it
had
known
the
rain
the
trees
grow
thickly
there
no
place
has
half
so
many
trees
and
hunted
things
elude
one
there
like
ancient
memories
the
path
itself
is
hard
to
find
and
slopes
up
suddenly
the
old
days
it
was
a
path
none
knew
so
well
as
we
the
path
slopes
upward
till
it
leaves
the
great
trees
far
behind
met
her
once
where
the
slender
birch
grow
up
to
meet
the
wind
where
the
poplars
quiver
endlessly
and
the
falling
leaves
are
grey
i
saw
her
come
and
i
was
glad
that
she
had
learned
the
way
she
paused
a
moment
where
the
path
grew
sunlighted
and
broad
within
her
hair
slept
all
the
gold
of
all
the
and
then
the
wood
closed
in
on
her
and
my
hand
found
her
hand
she
had
no
words
to
say
yet
i
was
quick
to
understand
i
dared
to
look
in
her
two
eyes
they
too
i
thought
were
grey
but
no
sun
shone
and
all
around
great
quiet
shadows
lay
yet
as
i
looked
i
surely
knew
that
they
knew
nought
of
tears
but
this
was
very
long
ago
year
perhaps
ten
years
all
this
was
long
ago
today
her
hand
met
not
with
mine
and
where
the
pathway
widened
out
i
saw
no
gold
hair
shine
i
had
a
weary
fruitless
search
think
that
her
wan
face
was
but
the
face
of
one
asleep
who
dreams
she
knew
this
place
song
in
o
gold
is
the
west
and
gold
the
washing
past
the
sides
of
my
yellow
birch
canoe
gold
are
the
great
drops
that
fall
from
my
paddle
the
hills
cry
a
golden
word
of
you
i
can
almost
see
you
where
its
own
shadow
creeps
down
the
side
gradual
and
slow
there
you
stand
waiting
the
goldenrod
and
thistle
glad
of
you
beside
fairest
thing
they
know
down
the
worn
the
tufted
pines
behind
you
grey
sheep
between
as
you
pass
swift
through
the
i
to
my
loved
one
come
striving
hard
against
the
long
trailing
grass
soon
shall
i
ground
on
the
shining
through
the
thick
alders
you
will
break
your
way
then
your
hand
in
mine
and
our
path
is
on
the
waters
for
us
the
long
shadows
and
the
end
of
day
whither
shall
we
go
see
over
to
the
westward
an
hour
of
precious
gold
standeth
still
for
you
and
me
still
gleams
the
grain
all
yellow
on
the
uplands
west
is
it
or
east
o
love
that
you
would
be
west
now
or
east
for
underneath
the
moonrise
also
it
is
fair
and
where
the
reeds
are
tall
and
the
only
little
noise
is
the
sound
of
quiet
waters
heavy
like
the
rain
we
shall
hear
the
fall
and
perhaps
we
shall
see
rising
slowly
from
the
driftwood
a
lone
crane
go
over
to
its
inland
nest
or
a
dark
line
of
ducks
will
come
in
across
the
islands
and
sail
overhead
to
the
marshes
of
the
west
now
a
little
wind
rises
up
for
our
returning
silver
grows
the
east
as
the
west
grows
grey
shadows
on
the
waters
shaded
are
the
meadows
the
firs
on
the
so
dark
as
they
yet
we
have
known
the
light
ever
such
an
august
your
hand
leave
mine
and
the
new
stars
gleam
as
we
separately
go
to
our
dreams
of
opened
heaven
the
golden
dawn
shall
tell
you
that
you
did
not
dream
vi
how
shall
i
greet
thee
autumn
with
loud
praise
and
joyous
song
and
wild
tumultuous
laughter
or
unrestrained
tears
shall
i
behold
only
the
scarlet
haze
of
these
thy
days
that
come
to
crown
this
best
of
all
the
years
or
shall
i
hear
even
now
those
sad
hours
those
unborn
hours
that
surely
follow
after
the
shedding
of
thy
till
i
too
learn
the
strength
and
change
of
time
who
am
made
one
with
grief
for
now
thou
comest
not
as
thou
of
old
wast
wont
to
come
and
now
mine
old
desire
is
sated
not
at
all
with
of
thy
splendid
gold
or
fold
on
fold
of
the
stained
clouds
thou
hast
for
coronal
still
all
these
ways
and
things
are
thine
and
still
before
thine
altar
burneth
the
ancient
fire
the
blackness
of
the
pines
is
still
the
same
and
the
same
peace
broodeth
behind
the
hill
where
the
old
maples
flame
i
counting
these
behold
no
change
and
yet
i
deem
they
know
not
me
for
lover
nor
live
because
of
me
and
yesterday
was
it
not
thou
i
met
thy
warm
lips
wet
and
purpled
with
wild
grapes
crushed
wantonly
and
yellow
wheat
bound
round
thy
hair
thy
brawn
breast
half
set
free
and
half
draped
over
with
long
green
leaves
of
corn
was
it
not
thou
thy
feet
unsandaled
and
thy
shoulders
bare
as
the
gleaned
fields
are
now
yea
autumn
it
was
thou
and
glad
was
i
to
meet
thee
and
caress
thee
for
an
hour
and
fancy
i
was
thine
for
then
i
had
not
learned
all
things
must
die
under
the
sky
that
everywhere
a
flaw
in
the
design
decay
crept
in
unquickening
the
mass
creed
empire
or
stone
or
flower
in
my
unwisdom
then
i
had
not
read
the
message
writ
across
face
alas
but
scanned
the
sun
instead
for
all
men
sow
and
then
it
when
harvest
time
is
come
and
thou
are
each
goeth
forth
to
reap
this
cometh
unto
him
perchance
one
saith
who
laboreth
this
is
my
wage
i
will
lie
down
and
sleep
he
maketh
no
oblation
unto
earth
another
in
his
heart
divine
unreason
seeing
his
fields
lie
barren
in
the
sun
crieth
o
fool
behold
the
little
worth
of
that
thy
toil
hath
won
and
so
one
sleepeth
dreaming
of
no
prayer
and
so
one
lieth
sleepless
till
thou
comest
to
bid
his
cursing
cease
then
in
his
dreams
envieth
the
share
whilst
otherwhere
thou
showest
still
thy
perfect
face
of
peace
o
autumn
unto
men
of
alien
lands
along
their
paths
a
little
while
thou
roamest
a
little
while
they
deem
thee
queenliest
and
good
the
of
thy
warm
hands
and
then
they
too
would
rest
they
too
would
only
rest
forgetting
thee
but
i
who
am
grown
the
wiser
for
thy
loving
never
may
thee
deny
and
when
the
last
child
hath
forsaken
me
and
quietly
men
go
about
the
house
wherein
i
lie
i
shall
lie
glad
feeling
across
my
face
thy
damp
and
clinging
hair
and
thy
hands
moving
to
find
my
wasted
hands
that
wait
for
thine
beneath
white
cloths
and
for
one
space
autumn
thy
lips
on
mine
vii
grey
if
she
would
come
now
and
say
will
you
lover
she
who
has
the
fairest
gifts
of
all
the
earth
to
think
you
i
should
ask
some
tremendous
thing
to
prove
her
her
life
say
and
all
her
love
so
long
as
she
might
live
should
i
touch
her
hair
her
hands
her
garments
even
nay
for
such
rewards
the
gods
their
own
good
time
have
set
once
these
were
mine
the
least
poor
one
was
heaven
now
lest
she
remember
i
pray
that
she
forget
merely
should
i
she
would
not
refuse
them
who
still
seems
very
kind
when
i
meet
with
her
in
only
three
of
our
old
days
she
help
to
choose
them
would
the
first
not
be
in
april
beside
the
sudden
streams
once
upon
a
morning
up
the
path
that
we
had
taken
we
saw
spring
come
where
the
are
grey
heard
the
high
hills
as
with
tread
of
armies
shaken
felt
the
strong
the
glory
of
that
day
and
one
afternoon
of
quiet
summer
weather
o
woodlands
and
along
the
blue
john
my
birch
finds
a
your
rafts
lie
close
then
o
what
starry
miles
before
the
grey
the
dawn
i
have
met
the
new
day
among
the
misty
islands
come
with
whine
of
and
whirr
of
hidden
wings
gleam
of
dewy
cobwebs
smell
of
grassy
ah
the
blood
grows
young
again
thinking
of
these
things
then
last
and
best
of
all
though
all
else
were
found
hollow
would
time
not
send
a
little
space
before
the
close
and
lead
us
up
the
old
road
we
used
to
follow
among
the
sunset
hills
till
the
moon
arise
then
home
through
the
damp
across
our
faces
the
grey
leaves
that
fall
the
moths
that
flutter
by
yea
this
for
me
now
of
all
old
hours
and
places
to
keep
when
i
am
dead
time
until
she
come
to
die
viii
are
those
her
feet
at
last
upon
the
stair
her
trailing
garments
echoing
there
the
falling
of
her
hair
about
a
year
ago
i
heard
her
come
thus
as
a
child
recalling
some
vague
memories
of
home
o
how
the
firelight
blinded
her
dear
eyes
i
saw
them
open
and
grow
wise
no
questions
no
replies
and
now
tonight
comes
the
same
sound
of
rain
the
wet
boughs
reach
against
the
pane
in
the
same
way
again
in
the
old
way
i
hear
the
moaning
wind
hunt
the
dead
leaves
it
can
not
find
blind
as
the
stars
are
blind
may
come
in
at
midnight
tired
and
wan
yet
if
once
again
at
dawn
i
wake
to
find
her
gone
ix
is
it
very
long
ago
things
were
as
they
are
now
or
was
it
ever
or
is
it
to
be
was
it
up
this
road
we
came
glad
the
end
was
far
taking
comfort
each
of
each
singing
cheerily
o
the
way
was
good
to
tread
up
hill
and
down
past
the
quiet
forestlands
by
the
grassy
plains
here
a
stony
wilderness
there
an
ancient
town
now
the
high
sun
over
us
now
the
driving
rains
strange
and
evil
things
we
what
cared
we
strong
men
and
unafraid
ripe
for
any
chance
battles
by
the
countless
score
red
blood
running
soon
we
learned
that
all
of
these
were
our
inheritance
some
of
us
there
were
that
fell
what
was
that
to
us
they
were
were
we
held
to
yet
pleasant
graves
we
digged
them
we
the
valorous
then
to
the
road
again
striving
to
forget
once
again
upon
the
road
the
seasons
passed
us
and
mayflowers
grasses
straight
and
tall
scarlet
banners
on
the
hills
snowdrifts
white
and
high
one
by
one
we
lived
them
through
giving
thanks
for
all
o
the
countries
that
we
found
in
our
wandering
wide
seas
without
a
sail
islands
fringed
with
foam
undiscovered
till
we
came
waiting
for
their
king
we
might
tarry
but
a
while
far
away
from
home
far
away
the
home
we
sought
we
must
be
gone
the
old
road
the
old
days
still
we
clung
to
those
the
dawn
came
the
noon
came
the
dusk
came
the
still
we
kept
upon
this
path
long
ago
we
chose
was
it
up
this
road
we
came
glad
the
end
was
far
yesterday
million
years
ago
surely
it
was
morning
then
now
the
twilight
star
hangs
above
the
hidden
and
very
low
quietly
the
earth
takes
on
the
hush
of
things
asleep
all
the
silence
of
the
birds
stills
the
moveless
air
we
must
not
falter
now
though
the
way
be
steep
just
beyond
the
turn
the
road
peace
is
thee
x
at
last
we
reached
the
pointed
firs
and
rested
for
a
little
while
the
light
of
home
was
in
her
smile
and
my
cold
hand
grew
warm
as
behind
across
the
level
snow
we
saw
the
touch
the
hill
where
we
had
felt
the
sunset
still
our
feet
had
many
miles
to
go
and
now
new
little
stars
were
born
in
the
dark
hollows
of
the
sky
perhaps
she
said
lest
we
should
die
of
weariness
before
the
morn
once
when
the
year
stood
still
at
june
at
even
we
had
tarried
there
till
dusk
came
noiseless
hair
trailing
along
a
pathway
strewn
with
broken
cones
and
things
but
now
tonight
it
seemed
that
she
therein
abode
continually
with
weighted
feet
and
folded
wings
and
so
we
lingered
not
for
dawn
to
mark
the
edges
of
out
path
but
with
such
home
a
blind
man
hath
at
midnight
we
went
groping
on
do
not
know
how
many
firs
we
stumbled
past
in
that
still
wood
only
i
know
that
once
we
stood
together
lips
on
between
the
midnight
and
the
dawn
we
came
out
on
the
farther
side
if
the
wood
dark
and
wide
its
shadows
now
here
far
withdrawn
and
o
the
white
stars
in
the
sky
and
o
the
glitter
of
the
snow
henceforth
we
know
our
feet
should
know
fair
ways
to
and
for
shadow
is
the
unwound
them
where
the
great
bear
swung
and
wide
across
the
darkness
flung
the
ribbons
of
the
northern
light
xi
what
and
do
you
find
it
good
sitting
here
alone
with
me
hark
the
wind
goes
through
the
wood
and
the
snow
drifts
heavily
when
the
morning
brings
the
light
how
know
i
you
will
not
say
what
a
storm
there
fell
last
night
is
the
next
inn
far
away
how
know
i
you
do
not
dream
of
some
country
where
the
grass
grows
up
tall
around
the
gleam
of
the
milestones
you
must
pass
even
now
perhaps
you
tell
while
your
hands
play
through
my
hair
every
hill
each
hidden
well
all
the
pleasant
valleys
there
that
before
a
clear
moon
shines
you
will
be
with
them
again
the
booming
of
the
pines
and
the
sleet
against
the
pane
wake
and
look
upon
the
sun
i
awoke
an
hour
ago
when
the
night
was
hardly
done
and
still
fell
a
little
snow
since
the
touched
the
light
many
things
have
my
hands
made
just
that
you
should
think
them
right
and
be
glad
that
you
have
stayed
i
worked
the
while
you
slept
scarcely
did
i
dare
to
sing
all
my
soul
a
silence
fearing
your
awakening
now
indeed
i
do
not
care
if
you
wake
for
now
the
sun
makes
the
least
of
all
things
fair
that
my
poor
two
hands
have
done
no
it
is
not
hard
to
find
you
will
know
it
by
the
up
behind
by
the
soft
perfume
that
fills
o
the
red
red
roses
there
full
the
narrow
path
thereto
by
the
dark
where
such
a
little
wind
breathes
through
by
the
way
the
bend
the
stream
takes
the
peace
that
twilight
brings
by
the
sunset
and
the
gleam
of
uncounted
wings
indeed
i
have
not
been
there
but
such
dreams
i
have
had
and
when
i
grow
old
the
green
leaves
will
hide
me
too
made
glad
yes
you
must
go
now
i
know
you
are
sure
you
understand
i
wish
that
i
could
go
now
and
lead
you
by
the
hand
xii
high
above
the
trees
swinging
in
across
the
hills
a
wide
cloud
ominous
and
slow
and
the
wind
that
rushes
over
sends
the
little
stars
to
cover
and
the
wavering
shadows
fade
along
the
snow
surely
on
my
window
hark
the
tumult
of
the
night
a
first
fitful
drop
of
scanty
rain
and
the
hillside
wakes
and
quivers
with
the
strength
of
newborn
rivers
come
to
make
our
northland
glad
and
free
again
o
remember
how
the
snow
fell
the
long
winter
through
was
it
yesterday
i
tied
your
snowshoes
on
all
my
soul
grew
wild
with
yearning
for
the
sight
of
you
returning
but
i
waited
all
those
hours
that
you
were
gone
for
i
watched
you
from
our
window
through
the
blurring
flakes
that
fell
till
you
gained
the
quiet
wood
and
then
i
knew
when
our
pathways
lay
together
how
we
revelled
in
such
weather
that
the
ancient
things
i
loved
would
comfort
you
now
i
knew
that
you
would
tarry
in
the
shadow
of
the
firs
and
remember
many
winters
overpast
all
the
hidden
signs
i
found
you
of
the
hiding
life
around
you
sleeping
patient
till
the
year
should
wake
at
last
here
a
tuft
of
fern
underneath
the
rounded
drift
a
rock
there
behind
a
covered
spring
and
here
nowhither
tending
tracks
beginning
not
nor
ending
was
it
bird
or
shy
furry
thing
and
remember
how
we
followed
down
the
winding
trail
by
the
ringing
louder
one
by
one
well
we
knew
that
we
were
nearing
now
the
edges
of
the
clearing
o
the
gleam
of
chips
all
yellow
in
the
sun
but
the
twilight
fell
about
us
as
we
watched
him
at
his
work
and
in
the
south
a
sudden
moon
hung
low
beckoned
us
beyond
the
the
the
meadows
where
our
little
house
loomed
dark
against
the
snow
and
that
night
our
quiet
house
just
before
the
dawn
we
heard
the
moaning
wind
only
then
its
wings
were
weighted
with
the
storm
itself
created
and
it
hid
the
very
things
it
came
to
find
in
the
morn
when
we
arose
and
looked
out
across
the
fields
hark
the
branches
how
they
shatter
overhead
seemed
it
not
that
time
was
sleeping
and
the
whole
wide
world
was
keeping
all
the
silence
of
the
houses
of
the
dead
ah
but
that
was
long
ago
and
tonight
the
wind
foretells
hark
above
the
wind
the
little
laughing
rills
forgetfulness
of
sorrow
when
the
dawn
shall
break
tomorrow
and
lead
me
to
the
bases
of
the
hills
to
the
low
southern
hills
where
of
old
we
used
to
hark
the
rumour
of
ten
thousand
ancient
springs
o
my
love
to
thy
dark
beyond
our
mad
do
thy
new
gods
bring
remembrance
of
such
things
