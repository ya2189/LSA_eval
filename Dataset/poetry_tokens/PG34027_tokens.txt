yesteryear

strolled
together
the
greening

and
heard
the
robin
tune
its
flute
note
clear
and
watched
above
the
white
cloud
squadrons
veer
and
saw
their
shifting
shadows
drift
away
adown
the
hudson
as
ships
seek

scene
is
still
the
same
the
violet
unlids
its
virgin
eye
its
amber
ore

dandelion
shows
and
yet
and
yet
he
comes
no
more
no
more
he
of
the
open
and
the
generous
heart
the
soul
that
sensed
all
flowerful
loveliness
the
nature
as
the
nature
of
a
child
who
found
some
rapture
in
the
wind
caress
beauty
in
humble
weed
and
mint
and
cress
and
sang
with
his
incomparable
art
the
magic
wonder
of
the
wood
and
wild
the
little
people
of
the
reeds
and
grass
murmur
their
blithe
companionable
lore
the
rills
renew
their
minstrelsy
alas
he
comes
no
more
no
more
and
yet
it
seems
as
though
he
needs
must
come
albeit
he
has
cast
off
mortality
such
was
his
passion
for
the
bourgeoning
time
such
to
his
spirit
was
the
ecstasy
the
hills
and
valleys
chorus

instinct
dumb

keyed

utterance

immortal
rhyme
ah
haply
in

fairer
spring
he
sees
bright
tides
sweep
over

here
how
vain
is

you
wandering

converse

the
exalted
few
who
sought

found

the
elusive
clue
to
beauty

in
that
diviner
air
bowing
in

still
to
its
sweet

why
sorrow

though

unkindly
lays
upon

clinton

foreword
it
is
with
a
sense
of
sadness
and
regret
that
this
book
written
by
one
who
universally
has
endeared
himself
to
lovers
of
nature
through
his
revelation
of
her
mysteries
must
be
prefaced
as
containing
the
last
songs
of
this
exquisite
singer
of
the
south
when
the
final
word
is
spoken
it
is
fitting
that
it
be
by
one
of
authority
william
dean
howells
in
the
pages
of
north
american
offers
this
tribute
i
had
read
his
poetry
and
loved
it
from
the
beginning
and
in
each
successive
expression
of
it
i
had
delighted
in
its
expanding
and
maturing
beauty
between
the
earliest
and
the
latest
thing
there
may
have
been
a
hundred
different
things
in
the
life
of
a
singer
but
we
take
the
latest
as
if
it
summed
him
up
in
motive
and
range
and
tendency
not
one
of
his
lovely
landscapes
but
thrilled
with
a
human
presence
penetrating
to
it
from
his
most
sensitive
and
subtle
spirit
until
it
was
all
but
painfully
alive
with
memories
with
regrets
with
longings
with
hopes
with
all
that
from
time
to
time
mutably
constitutes
us
men
and
women
and
yet
keeps
us
children
he
has
the
gift
in
a
measure
that
i
do
not
think
surpassed
in
any
poet
of
touching
some
commonest
thing
in
nature
and
making
it
live
from
the
manifold
associations
in
which
we
have
our
being
and
glow
thereafter
with
an
indistinguishable
beauty
no
other
poet
can
outword
this
poet
when
it
comes
to
choosing
some
epithet
fresh
from
the
earth
and
air
and
with
the
morning
sun
and
light
upon
it
for
an
emotion
or
an
experience
in
which
the
race
renews
its
youth
from
generation
to
generation
his
touch
leaves
everything
that
was
dull
to
the
sense
before
glowing
in
the
light
of
joyful
recognition
with
a
tone
of
conviction
edwin
markham
says
no
other
poet
of
the
later
american
choir
offers
so
large
a
collection
of
verse
as
cawein
does
and
no
other
american
minstrel
has
so
unvarying
a
devotion
to
nature
and
none
other
perhaps
has
so
keen
an
eye
so
sure
a
word
for
nature
magic
of
mood
her
trick
of
color
her
change
of
form
he
is
not
so
wild
and
as
bliss
carmen
nor
so
large
and
elemental
as
joaquin
miller
but
he
is
often
as
delicate
and
eerie
as
aldrich
and
sometimes
as
warm
and
rich
as
keats
in
the
april
affluence
of
cawein
landscape
is
not
the
sea
nor
the
desert
nor
the
mountain
but
the
lovely
inland
levels
of
his
kentucky
his
work
is
almost
wholly
objective
a
dash
more
of
human
import
mixed
into
the
beauty
and
melody
of
his
poetry
would
rank
him
with
lowell
and
the
other
great
lyrists
of
our
elder
choir
some
of
the
new
poems
portray
a
high
moral
passion
potent
with
the
belief
of
life
beyond
where
his
delicacy
of
vision
penetrates
the
shadow
and
seems
to
have
sighted
the
shore
that
has
given
his
soul
greeting
somewhere
yonder
in
a
world
uncharted
clear
sure
and
strong
is
the
vocal
loveliness
and
inevitable
word
with
which
this
poet
endears
the
little
forms
of
life
in
the
field
of
faery
the
song
of
songs
could
be
characterized
as
prophecy
by
one
in
whom
seemed
inherent
the
fatal
instinct
of
the
predestined
he
sought
for
song
to
lead
her
way
above
the
crags
of
wrong
and
he
gave
such
music
as
a
bird
gives
of
its
soul
when
dying
unconscious
if
it
heard
and
so
he
went
singing
to
his
islands

infinity

all
are
silent
for
his
sake
he
loved
thy
pipe
o
wreathed
and
piping
pan
so
thou
sadly
lone
within
thine
hollow
he
was
thy
blood
if
ever
mortal
man
therefore
thou
weepest
even
thou
apollo
but
o
the
grieving
of
the
little
things
above
the
pipe
and
lyre
throughout
the
woods
the
beating
of
a
thousand
airy
wings
the
cry

fragile
multitudes

desolate

telling
the
sorrow

up

quite
forgot

risen
on

paths
anew
the
wilding
blossoms
make
a
tender
sound
the
purple
weed
the
blue
and
all
the
timid
darlings
of
the
ground
here
here
the
pain
is
sharpest
for
he
walked
as
one
of
these
and
they
knew
naught
of
fear
but
told
him
daily
happenings
and
talked
their
lovely
secrets
in
his
ear
yet
we
do
bid
them
grieve
and
tell
their
grief
else
were
they
thankless
else
were
all
untrue

o

streams
in
which
the
heart
of
momus
that
glooms
and
gleams
is
drowned
with
all
its
dreams
there
is
a
smell
of
roses
in
the
room
dead
of
bloom
an
invalid
she
sits
there
in
the
gloom
and
contemplates
her
doom
the
pattern
of
the
paper
and
the
grain
of
carpet
with
its
stain
have
stamped
themselves
like
fever
on
her
brain
and
grown
a
part
of
pain
it
has
been
long
so
long
since
that
one
died
or
sat
there
by
her
side
she
felt
so
lonely
lost
she
would
have
cried
but
all
her
tears
were
dried
a
knock
came
on
the
door
she
hardly
heard
and
then
a
whispered
word
and
someone
entered
at
which
like
a
bird
her
caged
heart
cried
and
stirred
and
then
she
heard
a
voice
she
was
not
wrong
voice
alive
and
strong
she
listened
while
the
silence
filled
with
song
oh
she
had
waited
long
she
dared
not
turn
to
see
she
dared
not
look
but
slowly
closed
her
book
and
waited
for
his
kiss
could
scarcely
brook
the
weary
time
he
took
there
was
no
one
remembered
her
no
one
but
him
beneath
the
sun
then
had
entered
entered
but
to
shun
her
whose
long
work
was
done
she
raised
her
eyes
and
no
one
yet
she
felt
a
presence
near
that
smelt
like
faded
roses
and
that
seemed
to
melt
into
her
soul
that
knelt
she
could
not
see
but
that
he
was
there
smoothing
her
hands
and
hair
filling
with
scents
of
roses
all
the
air
standing
beside
her
chair
and
so
they
found
her
sitting
quietly
her
book
upon
her
knee
staring
before
her
as
if
she
could
see
what
was
it
death
or
he
ghost
of
there
is
a
house
beside
a
way
where
dwells
a
ghost
of
yesterday
the
old
face
of
a
beauty
faded
looks
from
its
garden
and
the
shaded
long
walks
of
that
seem
forevermore
to
sigh
and
dream
keep
whispering
low
a
word
that
true
of
shapes
that
haunt
its
avenue
clad
as
in
days
of
belle
and
beau
who
come
and
go
around
its
ancient
portico
at
first
in
stock
and
with
flitting
of
the
moth
and
bat
an
old
man
leaning
on
a
cane
comes
slowly
down
the
locust
lane
looks
at
the
house
then
groping
goes
into
the
garden
where
the
rose
still
keeps
sweet
tryst
with
moth
and
moon
and
humming
to
himself
a
tune
lorena
or
ben
bolt
we
say
waits
bent
and
gray
for
some
fair
ghost
of
yesterday
the
yesterday
that
holds
his
all
more
real
to
him
than
is
the
wall
of
mossy
stone
near
which
he
stands
still
reaching
out
for
her
his
hands
for
her
the
girl
who
waits
him
there
a
phantom
dark
of
hair
whose
loveliness
still
keeps
those
walks
and
with
whose
memory
he
talks
upon
his
heart
her
happy
head
so
it
is
said
the
girl
now
half
a
century
dead
of
the
visionary
i
came
upon
a
pool
that
shone
clear
among
the
hills
that
seemed
old
wizards
round
a
stone
of
magic
that
a
vision
thrills
and
as
i
leaned
and
looked
it
seemed
vague
shadows
gathered
there
and
here
a
dream
perhaps
the
water
dreamed
of
some
wild
past
some
year
a
temple
of
a
race
unblessed
rose
huge
within
a
hollow
land
where
on
an
altar
bare
of
breast
one
lay
a
man
bound
foot
and
hand
a
priest
who
served
some
hideous
god
stood
near
him
on
the
altar
stair
clothed
on
with
gold
and
at
his
nod
a
multitude
seemed
gathered
there
i
saw
a
sword
descend
and
then
the
priest
before
the
altar
turned
he
was
not
formed
like
mortal
man
but
like
a
beast
whose
eyeballs
burned
amorphous
strangely
old
he
glared
above
the
victim
he
had
slain
who
lay
with
bleeding
bosom
bared
from
which
dripped
slow
a
crimson
rain
then
turned
to
me
a
face
of
stone
and
mocked
above
the
murdered
dead
that
fixed
its
cold
eyes
on
his
own
and
cursed
him
with
a
look
of
dread
and
then
it
seemed
i
knew
the
place
and
how
this
sacrifice
befell
i
knew
the
god
the
priest
wild
face
i
knew
the
dead
man
knew
him
well
and
as
i
stooped
again
to
look
i
heard
the
dark
hills
sigh
and
laugh
and
in
the
pool
the
water
shook
as
if
one
stirred
it
with
a
staff
and
all
was
still
again
and
clear
the
pool
lay
crystal
as
before
temple
and
priest
were
gone
the
mere
had
closed
again
its
magic
door
a
face
was
there
it
seemed
to
shine
as
round
it
died
the
sunset
flame
the
victim
face
or
was
it
mine
they
were
to
me
the
very
same
and
yet
and
yet
could
this
thing
be
and
in
my
soul
i
seemed
to
know
at
once
this
was
a
memory
of
some
past
life
lived
long
ago
recorded
by
some
secret
sense
in
forms
that
we
as
dreams
retain
some
moment
as
experience
projects
in
pictures
on
the
brain
creaking
come
in
old
ghost
of
all
that
used
to
be
you
find
me
old
and
love
grown
cold
and
fortune
fled
to
younger
company
departed
as
the
glory
of
the
day
with
friends
and
you
it
seems
have
come
to
is
time
to
pray
come
sit
with
me
here
at
life
creaking
door
all
think
nay
then
guess
what
was
the
one
thing
eh
that
made
me
poor
the
love
of
beauty
that
i
could
not
bind
my
dream
of
truth
or
faith
in
humankind
but
never
mind
all
are
departed
now
with
love
and
youth
whose
stay
was
brief
and
left
but
grief
and
gray
regret
two
jades
who
tell
the
truth
whose
children
memories
of
things
to
be
and
things
that
failed
within
my
heart
ah
me
cry
constantly
none
can
turn
time
back
and
no
man
delay
death
when
he
knocks
what
good
are
clocks
or
human
hearts
to
stay
for
us
that
day
when
at
life
creaking
door
we
see
his
smile
death
at
the
door
of
this
old
house
of
trial
old
ghost
let
wait
awhile
the
end
of
the
this
is
the
truth
as
i
see
it
my
dear
out
in
the
wind
and
the
rain
they
who
have
nothing
have
little
to
fear
nothing
to
lose
or
to
gain
here
by
the
road
at
the
end
o
the
year
let
us
sit
down
and
drink
o
our
beer
and
her
cavalier
out
in
the
wind
and
the
rain
now
we
are
old
oh
is
it
fine
out
in
the
wind
and
the
rain
now
we
have
nothing
why
snivel
and
whine
what
would
it
bring
us
again
when
i
was
young
i
took
you
like
wine
held
you
and
kissed
you
and
thought
you
divine
the
habit
still
mine
out
in
the
wind
and
the
rain
oh
my
old
heart
what
a
life
we
have
led
out
in
the
wind
and
the
rain
how
we
have
drunken
and
how
we
have
fed
nothing
to
lose
or
to
gain
cover
the
fire
now
get
we
to
bed
long
was
the
journey
and
far
has
it
led
come
let
us
sleep
lass
sleep
like
the
dead
out
in
the
wind
and
the
rain
troubadour
of
night
they
say
is
no
man
friend
and
at
night
he
met
his
end
in
the
woods
of
trebizend
hate
crouched
near
him
as
he
strode
through
the
blackness
of
the
road
where
my
lord
seemed
some
huge
toad
eyes
of
murder
glared
and
burned
at
each
bend
of
road
he
turned
and
where
wild
the
torrent
churned
and
with
death
stood
and
stared
from
the
bush
as
by
he
fared
but
he
never
looked
or
cared
he
went
singing
and
a
rose
lay
upon
his
heart
repose
with
what
thought
of
her
who
knows
he
had
done
no
other
wrong
save
to
sing
a
simple
song
have
loved
you
loved
you
and
my
lady
smiled
and
sighed
gave
a
rose
and
looked
moist
eyed
and
forgot
she
was
a
bride
my
sweet
lady
jehan
de
grace
with
the
pale
madonna
face
he
had
brought
to
his
embrace
and
my
lord
saw
gave
commands
i
was
of
his
bandit
love
should
perish
at
our
hands
young
the
knight
was
he
should
sing
nevermore
of
love
or
spring
or
of
any
gentle
thing
when
he
stole
at
midnight
hour
to
my
lady
forest
bower
we
were
hidden
near
the
tower
in
the
woods
of
trebizend
there
he
met
an
evil
night
you
know
is
no
man
friend
he
has
fought
in
fort
and
field
borne
for
years
a
stainless
shield
and
in
strength
to
none
would
yield
but
we
seized
him
unaware
bound
and
hung
him
stripped
him
bare
left
him
to
the
wild
boars
there
never
has
my
lady
but
she
often
sits
alone
weeping
when
my
lord
is
gone
night
they
say
is
no
man
in
the
woods
of
trebizend
there
he
met
an
evil
end
now
my
old
lord
sleeps
in
peace
while
my
lady
each
one
sees
waits
and
keeps
her
memories
low
cliffs
which
at
noon
the
swoon
pines
through
which
the
crow
goes
winging
slow
dim
fields
the
sower
never
sows
or
reaps
or
mows
and
near
the
sea
a
ghostly
house
of
stone
where
all
is
old
and
lone
a
garden
falling
in
decay
where
statues
gray
peer
broken
out
of
tangled
weed
and
thorny
seed
satyr
and
nymph
that
once
made
love
by
walk
and
grove
and
near
a
fountain
shattered
green
with
mold
a
sundial
like
some
sad
life
bereft
to
musing
left
the
house
stands
love
and
youth
both
gone
in
sooth
but
still
it
sits
and
dreams
and
round
it
seems
some
memory
of
the
past
still
young
and
fair
haunting
each
crumbling
stair
and
suddenly
one
dimly
sees
come
through
the
trees
a
woman
like
a
wild
a
man
who
goes
softly
and
by
the
dial
they
kiss
a
while
then
drowsily
the
mists
blow
round
them
wan
and
they
like
ghosts
are
gone
lonely
a
river
binds
the
lonely
land
a
river
like
a
silver
band
to
crags
and
shores
of
yellow
sand
it
is
a
place
where
kildees
cry
and
endless
marches
eastward
lie
whereon
looks
down
a
ghostly
sky
a
house
stands
gray
and
all
alone
upon
a
hill
as
dim
of
tone
and
lonely
as
a
lonely
stone
there
are
no
signs
of
life
about
no
barnyard
bustle
cry
and
shout
of
children
who
run
laughing
out
no
crow
of
cocks
no
low
of
cows
no
tinkling
under
boughs
of
beech
or
song
in
garth
or
house
only
the
curlew
mournful
call
circling
the
sky
at
evenfall
and
loon
lamenting
over
all
a
garden
where
the
sunflower
dies
and
lily
on
the
pathway
lies
looks
blindly
at
the
blinder
skies
and
round
the
place
a
lone
wind
blows
as
when
the
autumn
grieving
goes
tattered
and
dripping
to
its
close
and
on
decaying
shrubs
and
vines
the
moon
thin
crescent
dwindling
shines
caught
in
the
claws
of
sombre
pines
and
then
a
pale
girl
like
a
flower
enters
the
garden
for
an
hour
she
waits
beside
a
bower
there
is
no
other
one
around
no
sound
except
the
cricket
sound
and
baying
of
a
hound
there
is
no
fire
or
to
flash
its
message
through
the
night
of
welcome
from
some
casement
bright
only
the
moon
that
thinly
throws
a
shadow
on
the
girl
and
rose
as
to
its
setting
slow
it
goes
and
when
is
gone
from
shore
and
stream
there
steals
a
mist
that
turns
to
dream
that
place
where
all
things
merely
seem
and
through
the
mist
there
goes
a
cry
not
of
the
earth
nor
of
the
sky
but
of
the
years
that
have
passed
by
and
with
the
cry
there
comes
the
rain
whispering
of
all
that
was
in
vain
at
every
door
and
and
she
who
waits
beside
the
rose
hears
with
her
heart
a
hoof
that
goes
galloping
afar
to
where
none
knows
and
then
she
bows
her
head
and
weeps
and
suddenly
a
shadow
sweeps
around
and
in
its
darkening
deeps
the
house
the
girl
the
cliffs
and
stream
are
and
they
and
all
things
seem
but
phantoms
merely
in
a
dream
wind
the
wind
that
met
her
in
the
park
came
hurrying
to
my
side
it
ran
to
me
it
leapt
to
me
and
nowhere
would
abide
it
whispered
in
my
ear
a
word
so
sweet
a
word
i
swear
it
smelt
of
honey
and
the
kiss
it
stolen
from
her
hair
then
shouted
me
the
flowery
way
whereon
she
walked
with
dreams
and
bade
me
wait
and
watch
her
pass
among
the
glooms
and
gleams
it
ran
to
meet
her
as
she
came
and
clasped
her
to
its
breast
it
kissed
her
throat
her
chin
her
mouth
and
laughed
its
merriest
then
to
my
side
it
leapt
again
and
took
me
by
surprise
the
kiss
it
stolen
from
her
lips
it
blew
into
my
eyes
since
then
it
seems
i
have
grown
blind
to
every
face
but
hers
it
haunts
me
sleeping
or
awake
and
is
become
my
curse
the
spell
that
kiss
has
laid
on
me
shall
hold
my
eyes
the
same
until
i
give
it
back
again
to
lips
from
which
it
came
pinks
and
phlox
that
fill
the
sense
with
drowsy
indolence
and
in
the
evening
skies
interior
splendor
pregnant
with
surprise
as
if
in
some
new
wise
the
full
moon
soon
would
rise
hung
with
the
crimson
aigrets
of
its
seeds
the
purple
monkshood
bleeds
the
dewy
crickets
chirr
and
everywhere
are
lights
of
lavender
and
scents
of
musk
and
myrrh
to
guide
the
foot
of
her
she
passes
like
a
misty
glimmer
on
to
where
the
rose
blooms
wan
a
twilight
moth
in
flight
as
in
the
west
its
streak
of
chrysolite
the
dusk
erases
quite
and
ushers
in
the
night
and
now
another
shadow
passes
slow
with
firefly
light
the
scent
of
a
cigar
and
two
who
kiss
beneath
the
where
in
a
moonbeam
bar
a
whippoorwill
cries
afar
again
the
tale
is
told
that
has
been
told
so
often
here
of
old
ghosts
of
dead
lovers
they
or
memories
only
of
some
perished
day
old
ghosts
no
time
shall
lay
that
haunt
the
place
alway
name
on
the
i
saw
a
name
carved
on
a
tree
julia
a
simpler
name
there
could
not
be
julia
but
seeing
it
i
seemed
to
see
a
devon
garden
pleasantly
about
a
parsonage
the
bee
made
where
rosemary
and
pink
and
phlox
and
peony
bowed
down
to
one
whom
herrick
made
to
bloom
in
poetry
a
moment
there
i
saw
her
stand
julia
a
gillyflower
in
her
hand
julia
and
then
and
big
and
bland
as
raised
by
some
magician
wand
herrick
himself
passed
by
and
smiling
and
the
quiet
land
seemed
to
take
on
and
understand
a
dream
long
dreamed
and
for
the
lives
of
two
some
gladness
planned
and
then
i
seemed
to
hear
a
sigh
julia
and
someone
softly
walking
nigh
julia
the
leaves
shook
and
a
butterfly
trailed
past
and
through
the
sleepy
sky
a
bird
flew
crying
strange
its
cry
then
suddenly
before
my
eye
two
lovers
strolled
they
knew
not
why
i
looked
amazed
but
i
had
seen
old
ghosts
of
long
dead
loves
go
by
haunted
there
a
tattered
marigold
and
dead
asters
manifold
showed
him
where
the
garden
old
of
time
bloomed
briar
and
thistle
overgrew
corners
where
the
rose
once
blew
where
the
phlox
of
every
hue
lay
entombed
here
a
coreopsis
flower
pushed
its
disc
above
a
bower
where
once
poured
a
starry
shower
bronze
and
gold
and
a
twisted
hollyhock
and
the
remnant
of
a
stock
struggled
up
burr
and
dock
through
the
mold
with
mossy
cloak
strewed
a
place
beneath
an
oak
where
the
lay
broke
by
the
tree
and
he
thought
of
who
here
sat
with
him
but
yesteryear
her
whose
presence
now
seemed
near
stealthily
and
the
garden
seemed
to
look
for
her
coming
petals
shook
on
the
spot
where
with
her
book
oft
she
suddenly
there
blew
a
wind
and
across
the
garden
blind
like
a
black
thought
in
a
mind
stole
a
cat
lean
as
hunger
like
the
shade
of
a
dream
a
ghost
unlaid
through
the
weeds
its
way
it
made
gaunt
and
old
once
was
he
looked
to
see
if
followed
to
the
then
recalled
how
long
since
she
had
been
mold
closed
shut
it
out
of
the
heart
this
grief
o
love
with
the
years
grown
old
and
hoary
and
let
in
joy
that
life
is
brief
and
give
god
thanks
for
the
end
of
the
story
the
bond
of
the
flesh
is
transitory
and
beauty
goes
with
the
lapse
of
years
the
brow
white
rose
and
the
hair
dark

god
be
thanked
for
the
severing
shears
over
the
past
heart
waste
no
tears
over
the
past
and
all
its
madness
its
wine
and
wormwood
hopes
and
fears
that
never
were
worth
a
moment
sadness
here
she
lies
who
was
part
o
its
gladness
wife
and
mistress
and
shared
its
woe
the
good
of
life
as
well
as
its
badness
look
on
her
face
and
see
if
you
know
is
this
the
face
yea
ask
it
slow
the
hair
the
form
that
we
used
to
cherish
where
is
the
glory
of
the
beauty
we
said
would
never
like
a
dream
we
dream
or
a
thought
we
nourish
nothing
of
earth
immortal
is
this
is
the
end
however
we
flourish
all
that
is
fair
must
come
to
this
long
he
found
the
long
room
as
it
was
of
old
glimmering
with
sunset
gold
that
made
the
tapestries
seem
full
of
eyes
strange
with
a
wild
surmise
glaring
upon
a
psyche
where
she
shone
carven
of
stainless
stone
holding
a
crystal
heart
where
many
a
sun
seemed
starrily
bound
in
one
and
near
her
grim
in
rigid
metal
stood
an
old
knight
in
a
wood
groping
his
way
the
bony
wreck
that
was
his
steed
at
weary
pause
and
over
these
a
canvas
one
mad
mesh
of
chrysoprase
tints
of
flesh
and
breasts
bohemian
cups
whose
glory
gleamed
for
one
who
brutish
seemed
a
hideous
troll
unto
whose
lustful
arms
she
yielded
glad
her
charms
then
he
remembered
all
shame
and
knew
the
thing
that
he
must
do
these
were
but
records
of
life
the
whole
portrayed
to
him
his
so
drawing
forth
the
slim
bithynian
phial
he
drained
it
with
a
smile
and
the
knight
and
psyche
fell
and
died
the
arras
glared
grimly
at
him
where
all
night
he
lay
and
where
a
stealthy
ray
pointed
her
to
her
that
nymph
above
who
gave
the
troll
her
love
pearl
and
when
pearl
and
gold
deeps
of
musk
the
moon
curves
silvering
the
dusk
as
in
a
garden
dreaming
a
lily
slips
its
dewy
husk
a
firefly
in
its
gleaming
i
of
my
garden
am
a
guest
my
garden
that
in
beauty
dressed
of
simple
shrubs
and
oldtime
flowers
chats
with
me
of
the
perished
hours
when
companioned
me
in
life
living
remote
from
care
and
strife
it
says
to
me
how
sad
and
slow
the
hours
of
daylight
come
and
go
until
the
night
walks
here
again
with
moon
and
starlight
in
her
train
and
she
and
i
with
perfumed
words
of
winds
and
waters
dreaming
birds
and
flowers
and
crickets
and
the
moon
for
hour
on
hour
in
soul
and
you
and
you
sit
here
and
listen
in
the
dew
for
her
the
love
you
used
to
know
who
often
walked
here
long
ago
long
ago
the
young
sweet
love
you
used
to
know
long
ago
whom
oft
i
watched
with
violet
eye
or
eye
of
dew
as
she
passed
by
as
she
passed
by
and
i
reply
with
half
a
sigh
you
knew
her
too
as
well
as
i
that
young
sweet
love
of
that
young
sweet
love
who
walked
here
oh
speak
no
more
of
the
days
gone
by
dear
days
gone
by
lest
i
lay
me
down
on
your
heart
and
die
the
moon
a
circle
of
gold
the
crowded
housetops
rolled
and
peeped
in
an
attic
where
sordid
things
and
bare
a
sick
child
lay
and
gazed
at
a
road
to
the
a
road
he
followed
mazed
that
grew
from
a
a
road
of
light
that
led
from
the
foot
of
his
out
of
that
room
of
hate
where
poverty
slept
by
his
mate
sickness
out
of
the
street
into
a
wonderland
where
a
voice
called
far
and
sweet
come
follow
our
fairy
band
a
purple
shadow
sprinkled
with
golden
twinkled
suddenly
into
the
room
out
of
the
winter
gloom
and
it
wore
a
face
to
him
of
a
dream
he
dreamed
a
form
of
joy
whose
face
was
dim
yet
bright
with
a
magic
charm
and
the
shadow
seemed
to
trail
sounds
that
were
green
and
frail
notes
that
fell
like
drops
in
a
ferny
dell
a
whispered
lisp
and
stir
like
winds
among
the
leaves
blent
with
a
and
coo
of
a
dove
that
grieves
and
the
elfin
bore
on
its
back
a
little
faery
pack
of
forest
scents
of
loam
and
mossy
sounds
of
foam
and
of
its
contents
breathed
as
might
a
clod
of
ground
feeling
a
bud
unsheathed
there
in
its
womb
profound
and
the
shadow
smiled
and
gazed
at
the
child
then
softly
raised
its
arms
and
seemed
to
grow
to
a
tree
in
the
attic
low
and
from
its
glimmering
hands
shook
emerald
seeds
of
dreams
from
which
grew
fairy
bands
like
firefly
motes
and
gleams
the
child
had
seen
them
before
in
his
dreams
of
fairy
lore
the
elves
each
with
a
light
to
guide
his
feet
out
of
this
world
to
a
world
where
magic
built
him
towers
and
fable
old
unfurled
flags
like
wonderful
flowers
and
the
child
who
knew
this
smiled
and
rose
a
different
child
no
more
he
knew
of
pain
or
fear
of
heart
and
at
poverty
there
that
slept
he
never
even
glanced
but
into
the
stept
and
out
of
the
garret
danced
out
of
the
earthly
gloom
out
of
the
sordid
room
out
on
a
moonbeam
ray
now
at
last
to
play
there
with
comrades
found
children
of
the
moon
there
on
faery
ground
where
none
would
find
him
soon
olim
febrile
perfumes
as
of
faded
roses
in
the
old
house
speak
of
love
love
long
past
and
where
the
soft
day
closes
down
the
west
gleams
a
ray
pointing
where
departed
splendor
perished
and
the
path
that
night
shall
walk
and
hang
on
blue
boughs
of
heaven
gold
long
cherished
fruit
hesperian
that
the
ancients
sang
and
to
him
who
sits
there
dreaming
musing
at
the
window
in
the
twilight
wan
like
old
scent
of
roses
interfusing
comes
a
vision
of
a
day
that
gone
and
he
sees
youth
walking
brave
but
dimly
the
roses
in
the
afterglow
and
beside
him
like
a
star
seen
slimly
love
who
used
to
meet
him
and
again
he
seems
to
hear
the
flowers
whispering
faintly
of
what
no
one
knows
of
the
dreams
they
dreamed
there
for
long
hours
youth
and
love
between
their
hearts
a
rose
youth
is
dead
and
love
oh
where
departed
like
the
last
streak
of
the
dying
day
somewhere
yonder
in
a
world
uncharted
calling
him
with
memories
away
magic
what
is
the
gold
of
to
that
men
find
deep
in
the
poet
mind
that
magic
purse
of
dreams
from
which
god
builds
his
universe
that
makes
life
rich
with
many
a
vision
taking
the
soul
from
out
its
prison
of
facts
with
the
precision
a
wildflower
dons
when
spring
comes
knocking
at
the
door
of
earth
across
the
windy
lawns
calling
to
joy
to
rise
and
dance
before
her
happy
feet
or
with
the
beat
and
bright
exactness
of
a
star
hanging
its
punctual
point
afar
when
night
comes
tripping
over
heaven
floor
leaving
a
gate
ajar
that
leads
the
heart
from
all
its
aching
far
above
where
day
is
breaking
out
of
the
doubts
the
agonies
the
strife
and
sin
to
join
with
these
hope
and
beauty
and
joy
that
build
their
golden
walls
of
sunset
where
with
spirits
filled
a
presence
calls
and
points
a
land
where
love
walks
silent
hand
in
hand
with
the
spirit
of
god
and
leads
man
right
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
light
child
at
the
the
sunset
was
a
sleepy
gold
and
stars
were
in
the
skies
when
down
a
weedy
lane
he
strolled
in
vague
and
thoughtless
wise
and
then
he
saw
it
near
a
wood
an
old
house
gabled
brown
like
some
old
woman
in
a
hood
looking
toward
the
town
a
child
stood
at
its
broken
gate
singing
a
childish
song
and
weeping
softly
as
if
fate
had
done
her
child
heart
wrong
he
spoke
to
her
now
tell
me
dear
why
do
you
sing
and
weep
but
she
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
but
stared
as
if
asleep
then
suddenly
she
turned
and
fled
as
if
with
soul
of
fear
he
followed
but
the
house
looked
dead
and
empty
many
a
year
the
light
was
wan
the
dying
day
grew
ghostly
suddenly
and
from
the
house
he
turned
away
wrapped
in
its
mystery
they
told
him
no
one
dwelt
there
now
it
was
a
haunted
and
then
it
came
to
him
somehow
the
memory
of
a
face
that
child
like
hers
whose
name
was
joy
for
whom
his
heart
was
fain
the
face
of
her
whom
when
a
boy
he
played
with
in
that
lane
lost
the
black
night
showed
its
hungry
teeth
and
gnawed
with
sleet
at
roof
and
pane
beneath
the
door
i
heard
it
breathe
a
beast
that
growled
in
vain
the
hunter
wind
stalked
up
and
down
and
crashed
his
through
each
tree
before
his
rage
in
tattered
gown
i
saw
the
maid
moon
flee
there
stole
a
footstep
to
my
door
a
voice
cried
in
my
room
and
there
a
shadow
cowled
and
gaunt
and
hoar
death
leaned
above
my
chair
he
beckoned
me
he
bade
me
rise
and
follow
through
the
madman
night
into
my
heart
core
pierced
his
eyes
and
lifted
me
with
might
i
rose
i
made
no
more
delay
and
followed
where
his
eyes
compelled
and
through
the
darkness
far
away
they
lit
me
and
enspelled
until
we
reached
an
ancient
wood
that
flung
its
twisted
arms
around
as
if
in
anguish
that
it
stood
on
dark
unhallowed
ground
and
then
i
saw
it
cold
and
blind
the
dream
that
had
my
heart
to
share
that
fell
before
its
feet
could
find
its
home
and
perished
there
this
world
is
made
a
witchcraft
place
with
gazing
on
a
woman
face
now
is
her
smile
whose
sorcery
turns
all
my
thoughts
to
melody
now
is
her
frown
that
comes
and
goes
that
makes
my
day
a
page
of
prose
and
now
her
laugh
or
but
a
word
that
in
my
heart
frees
wild
a
bird
some
day
perhaps
a
kiss
of
hers
will
lift
from
my
dumb
life
the
curse
of
longing
inarticulate
that
keeps
me
sad
and
celibate
the
gentian
and
the
bluebell
so
can
change
my
calendar
i
know
not
how
the
year
may
go
or
what
the
seasons
are
the
months
in
some
mysterious
wise
take
their
expression
from
her
eyes
the
gentian
speaks
to
memory
of
autumns
long
since
gone
when
blue
eyes
smiled
up
at
me
and
heaven
was
flushed
with
dawn
was
autumn
then
and
leaves
were
sere
but
in
my
heart
was
spring
o
the
year
the
bluebell
says
a
message
too
of
springs
long
passed
away
when
in
my
eyes
her
eyes
of
blue
gazed
and
was
close
of
day
spring
spread
around
her
fragrant
chart
but
it
was
autumn
in
my
heart
old
come
let
climb
into
our
attic
in
our
house
that
old
and
gray
life
you
old
and
i
rheumatic
and
it
close
of
day
lay
aside
your
rags
and
tatters
shirt
and
shoes
so
soiled
with
clay
they
no
use
now
nothing
matters
it
is
close
of
day
let
to
bed
it
cold
no
fire
and
no
lamp
to
make
a
where
our
servant
young
desire
gone
at
close
of
day
oft
she
served
us
with
fine
glances
helped
us
out
at
work
and
play
she
is
gone
now
better
chances
and
it
close
of
day
where
is
hope
who
flaunted
scarlet
hope
who
led
us
oft
astray
has
she
proved
herself
a
harlot
at
the
close
of
day
what
become
of
dream
and
vision
friends
we
thought
were
here
to
stay
has
life
clapped
the
two
in
prison
at
the
close
of
day
they
are
gone
and
how
we
miss
them
they
who
made
our
garret
gay
how
we
used
to
hug
and
kiss
them
but
is
close
of
day
where
friend
love
now
who
supposes
has
he
flung
himself
away
left
us
for
a
wreath
of
roses
at
the
close
of
day
and
where
song
the
soul
elected
has
he
quit
us
too
for
aye
was
it
poverty
he
suspected
near
the
close
of
day
how
our
attic
rang
their
laughter
how
it
echoed
laugh
and
lay
none
may
take
their
place
hereafter
it
is
close
of
day
we
have
done
the
best
we
could
do
let
us
kneel
awhile
and
pray
now
no
matter
what
we
would
do
it
is
close
of
day
let
to
bed
then
it
december
long
enough
since
it
was
may
let
forget
it
and
remember
now
is
close
of
day
last
oh
for
some
cup
of
consummating
might
filled
with
life
kind
conclusion
lost
in
night
a
wine
of
darkness
that
with
death
shall
cure
this
sickness
called
existence
oh
to
find
surcease
of
sorrow
quiet
for
the
mind
an
end
of
thought
in
something
dark
and
sure
mandrake
and
hellebore
or
poison
pure
some
drug
of
death
wherein
there
are
no
dreams
no
more
no
more
with
patience
to
endure
the
wrongs
of
life
the
hate
of
men
it
seems
or
wealth
authority
tyranny
of
time
and
lamentations
and
the
boasts
of
man
to
hear
no
more
the
wild
complaints
of
toil
and
struggling
merit
that
unknown
must
starve
to
see
no
more
life
disregard
for
art
oh
god
to
know
no
longer
anything
nor
good
nor
evil
or
what
either
means
nor
hear
the
changing
tides
of
customs
roll
on
the
dark
shores
of
time
no
more
to
hear
the
stream
of
life
that
furies
on
the
shoals
of
hard
necessity
no
more
to
see
the
unavailing
battle
waged
of
need
against
adversity
merely
to
lie
at
last
pulseless
and
still
at
peace
beneath
the
sod
to
think
and
dream
no
more
no
more
to
hope
at
rest
at
last
at
last
at
peace
and
rest
clasped
by
some
kind
tree
gnarled
arm
of
root
bearing
me
upward
in
its
large
embrace
to
gentler
things
and
fairer
clouds
and
winds
and
stars
and
sun
and
moon
to
undergo
the
change
the
great
trees
know
when
spring
comes
in
with
shoutings
and
rejoicings
of
the
rain
to
swiftly
rise
an
atom
in
a
host
the
myriad
army
of
the
leaves
and
stand
a
handsbreadth
nearer
heaven
and
what
is
god
to
pulse
in
sap
that
beats
unfevered
in
the
life
we
call
inanimate
the
heart
of
some
great
tree
and
so
unconsciously
as
sleeps
a
child
clasped
in
its
mother
arm
be
taken
back
in
amplitudes
of
grace
to
nature
heart
and
so
be
lost
in
her
a
shadow
glided
down
the
way
where
sunset
groped
among
the
trees
and
all
the
woodland
bower
asway
with
trouble
of
the
evening
breeze
a
shape
it
moved
with
head
held
down
i
knew
it
not
yet
seemed
to
know
its
form
its
carriage
of
a
clown
its
raiment
of
the
it
never
turned
or
spoke
a
word
but
fixed
its
gaze
on
something
far
as
if
within
its
heart
it
heard
the
summons
of
the
evening
star
i
turned
to
it
and
tried
to
speak
to
ask
it
of
the
thing
it
saw
or
heard
beyond
earth
outmost
peak
the
dream
the
splendor
and
the
awe
what
beauty
or
what
terror
there
still
bade
its
purpose
to
ascend
above
the
sunset
sombre
glare
the
twilight
and
the
long
day
end
it
looked
at
me
but
said
no
word
then
suddenly
i
saw
the
truth
was
the
call
that
once
i
heard
and
failed
to
follow
in
my
youth
now
well
i
saw
that
this
was
i
my
own
dead
self
who
walked
with
me
who
died
in
that
dark
hour
gone
by
with
all
the
dreams
that
used
to
be
the
let
us
bid
the
world
now
while
sun
and
cloud
above
us
while
we
nothing
to
deny
nothing
but
our
selves
to
love
us
let
us
fancy
i
and
you
all
the
dreams
we
dreamed
came
true
we
have
gone
but
half
the
road
rugged
road
of
root
and
bowlder
made
the
best
of
life
dark
load
cares
that
helped
us
to
grow
older
we
my
dear
have
done
our
best
let
us
stop
awhile
and
rest
let
us
by
this
halfway
stile
put
away
the
world
desire
and
sit
down
a
little
while
with
our
hearts
and
light
a
fire
sing
the
songs
that
once
we
sung
in
the
days
when
we
were
young
haply
they
will
bring
again
from
the
lands
of
song
and
story
to
our
sides
the
elfin
train
of
the
dreams
we
dreamed
of
glory
that
are
one
now
with
the
crew
of
the
deeds
we
did
not
do
here
upon
the
road
of
life
let
us
rest
us
take
our
pleasure
free
from
care
and
safe
from
strife
count
again
our
only
treasure
love
that
helped
us
on
our
way
our
companion
night
and
day
listen
dearest
you
must
love
me
more
more
than
you
did
before
hark
what
a
beating
here
of
wings
never
at
rest
dear
in
your
breast
is
it
your
heart
with
its
flutterings
making
a
music
love
for
us
both
or
merely
a
moth
a
moth
which
out
of
the
garden
fragrance
swings
weaving
a
spell
that
holds
the
rose
and
the
moon
in
thrall
i
love
you
more
than
i
can
tell
and
no
recall
how
long
ago
our
quarrel
and
all
you
say
you
know
a
perfect
pearl
grows
out
of
well
a
little
friction
tiny
grain
of
sand
or
shell
so
love
grew
out
of
that
moment
pain
the
heart
disdain
since
then
i
have
thought
of
no
one
but
you
and
how
your
heart
would
beat
on
mine
like
light
on
dew
and
i
thought
how
foolish
to
fret
and
pine
better
to
claim
the
fault
all
mine
to
go
to
you
and
tell
you
that
and
how
stale
and
flat
all
life
without
you
was
and
vain
and
when
i
came
you
turned
and
smiled
like
a
darling
child
and
i
knew
from
your
look
that
in
your
heart
you
had
followed
the
train
of
thought
that
made
me
yours
dearest
no
more
we
shall
never
part
so
turn
your
face
as
you
did
i
smooth
your
brow
and
kiss
now
tell
me
true
did
you
miss
me
dear
as
i
missed
you
above
the
world
a
glare
of
sunset
guns
and
spears
an
army
no
one
hears
of
mist
and
air
long
lines
of
bronze
and
gold
huge
helmets
each
a
cloud
and
then
a
fortress
old
there
in
the
night
that
phantoms
seem
to
crowd
a
face
of
flame
a
hand
of
crimson
alchemy
is
waved
and
solemnly
at
its
command
opens
a
fiery
well
a
burning
hole
from
which
a
stream
of
hell
a
river
of
blood
in
frenzy
seems
to
roll
and
there
upon
a
throne
like
some
vast
precipice
above
that
river
of
dis
behold
a
king
alone
around
whom
shapes
of
blood
take
form
each
one
the
peer
of
those
who
in
the
wood
of
dante
hell
froze
up
the
heart
with
fear
then
shapes
that
breast
to
breast
gallop
to
face
a
foe
and
through
the
crimson
glow
th
imperial
crest
of
him
whose
banner
flies
above
a
world
that
burns
a
raven
in
the
skies
and
as
it
flies
into
a
turns
the
wild
trees
writhe
and
twist
their
gaunt
limbs
wrung
with
fear
and
now
into
my
ear
a
word
seems
hissed
a
message
filled
with
dread
a
dark
foreboding
word
behold
we
are
the
dead
who
here
on
earth
lived
only
by
the
sword
iron
upon
the
iron
crags
of
war
i
heard
his
terrible
daughters
in
battle
speak
while
at
their
feet
in
gulfs
of
human
waters
a
voice
intoning
where
is
god
in
ceaseless
sorrow
beat
and
to
my
heart
in
doubt
i
said
god
god
above
the
storm
o
heart
be
brave
be
comforted
and
keep
your
warm
for
her
who
breasts
the
storm
god
peace
the
fair
of
form
i
heard
the
battle
angels
cry
above
the
slain
red
mountains
while
from
their
wings
the
lightnings
hurled
of
death
destroying
fountains
and
thunder
of
their
revels
rolled
around
the
ruined
world
still
to
my
heart
in
fear
i
cried
god
god
is
watching
there
my
heart
oh
keep
the
doorway
wide
here
in
your
house
of
care
for
her
who
wanders
there
god
peace
with
happy
hair
the
darkness
and
the
battle
passed
and
rushing
on
wild
pinions
the
hosts
of
havoc
shrieked
their
hate
and
fled
to
hell
dominions
and
lo
i
heard
out
in
the
night
a
knocking
at
the
gate
and
one
who
cried
aloud
to
me
the
night
and
storm
are
gone
oh
open
wide
the
door
and
see
who
waits
here
in
the
dawn
peace
with
god
splendor
on
back
to
the
sad
world
drawn
iron
they
pass
with
heavy
eyes
and
hair
before
the
christ
upon
the
cross
the
nations
stricken
with
their
loss
and
lifting
faces
of
despair
what
is
the
prayer
they
pray
to
him
christ
jesus
on
the
iron
cross
the
christ
neglected
dark
with
moss
whose
hands
are
pierced
whose
face
is
grim
is
it
forgiveness
for
great
sin
they
plead
before
the
iron
cross
or
for
some
gift
of
gold
or
dross
or
battle
lost
that
they
would
win
with
eyes
where
hate
and
horror
meet
they
pass
before
the
iron
cross
the
cross
that
ancient
words
emboss
where
hangs
the
christ
with
feet
his
hair
is
fallen
on
his
face
his
head
hangs
sidewise
from
the
cross
the
crucified
who
knows
all
loss
and
had
on
earth
no
resting
place
o
world
of
men
he
seems
to
say
behold
me
on
your
iron
cross
to
me
why
kneel
and
tell
your
loss
why
kneel
to
me
and
weep
and
pray
have
i
not
taught
you
to
forgive
and
bade
you
from
my
iron
cross
believe
and
bear
your
grief
and
loss
that
after
death
you
too
may
live
you
have
not
followed
at
my
call
you
keep
me
on
this
iron
cross
and
pray
me
keep
you
from
all
loss
and
save
and
comfort
you
you
ask
for
love
and
hate
the
more
you
keep
me
on
this
iron
cross
restore
to
me
my
greater
loss
the
brotherhood
of
rich
and
poor
they
pass
with
weary
eyes
and
hair
before
the
christ
upon
the
cross
the
nations
wailing
of
their
loss
and
lifting
faces
of
despair
between
the
death
of
day
and
birth
of
night
by
war
red
light
i
met
with
one
in
trailing
sorrows
clad
whose
features
had
the
look
of
him
who
died
to
set
men
right
around
him
many
horrors
like
great
worms
terrific
forms
crawled
helmed
like
hippogriff
and
rosmarine
gaunt
and
obscene
urged
on
to
battle
with
a
thousand
arms
columns
of
steel
and
iron
belching
flame
before
them
came
and
cities
crumbled
and
amid
them
trod
havoc
their
god
with
desolation
that
no
tongue
may
name
and
out
of
heaven
came
a
burning
breath
and
on
it
death
riding
before
him
huge
and
bellowing
herds
of
beasts
like
birds
and
demon
nothing
conquereth
went
by
and
fear
that
shrieks
and
dies
and
mouths
with
cries
of
famine
and
the
madness
of
despair
and
everywhere
curses
like
kings
with
eyes
and
lo
the
shadow
shook
and
cried
a
name
that
grew
a
flame
above
the
world
and
said
give
heed
give
heed
see
how
they
bleed
my
wounds
my
wounds
was
it
for
this
i
came
where
is
the
love
for
which
i
shed
my
blood
and
where
the
good
i
preached
and
died
for
lo
ye
have
denied
and
crucified
me
here
again
who
swore
me
brotherhood
then
overhead
the
vault
of
night
was
rent
the
firmament
winged
thunder
over
of
aerial
craft
and
battle
laughed
titanic
laughter
as
its
way
it
went
end
of
the
rose
that
wrote
its
message
on
the
bright
manuscript
has
turned
her
perfumed
face
towards
fall
and
waits
for
the
pale
flower
to
take
her
place
with
eyes
distraught
and
dark
disheveled
hair
the
season
dons
a
tattered
cloak
of
storm
and
waits
with
night
that
darkly
seems
to
share
her
trouble
and
alarm
it
is
the
close
of
summer
in
the
sky
the
sunset
lit
a
fire
of
drift
and
sat
watching
the
last
day
robed
in
empire
die
upon
the
burning
ghat
the
first
leaf
crimsons
and
the
last
rose
falls
and
night
goes
stalking
on
her
cloak
of
rain
dripping
and
followed
through
her
haunted
halls
by
ail
death
phantom
train
the
sorrow
of
the
earth
and
all
that
dies
and
all
that
suffers
in
her
breast
she
bears
outside
the
house
of
life
she
stops
and
cries
the
burden
of
her
cares
then
on
the
window
knocks
with
crooked
hands
her
arms
to
heaven
love
hears
her
crying
who
then
understands
has
god
forgot
the
world
lust
of
the
since
man
first
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
hers
and
saw
her
vampire
beauty
which
is
lust
all
else
is
dust
within
the
compass
of
the
universe
with
heart
of
jael
and
with
face
of
ruth
she
sits
upon
the
tomb
of
time
and
quaffs
heart
blood
and
laughs
at
all
life
calls
most
noble
and
the
truth
the
fire
of
conquest
and
the
wine
of
dreams
are
in
her
veins
and
in
her
eyes
the
lure
of
things
unsure
urging
the
world
forever
to
extremes
without
her
life
would
stagnate
in
a
her
touch
it
is
puts
pleasure
even
in
so
life
attain
her
end
she
cares
not
if
the
means
be
vile
she
knows
no
pity
mercy
or
hers
is
to
build
and
then
exterminate
to
slay
create
and
twixt
the
two
maintain
an
equal
course
before
ever
since
man
was
man
a
fiend
has
stood
outside
his
house
of
good
war
with
his
terrible
toys
that
win
men
hearts
to
follow
murderous
arts
his
spurs
are
but
of
little
use
except
as
old
refuse
of
life
to
hang
and
testify
with
rust
of
deeds
long
one
with

a

on
a

a

to

the

that
of

thy

a

amen
the
season
of
the
rose
and
peace
is
past
it
could
not
last
there
heartbreak
in
the
hills
and
stormy
sighs
of
sorrow
in
the
plains
and
skies
while
earth
regards
aghast
the
last
red
leaf
that
flies
the
world
is
cringing
in
the
darkness
where
war
left
his
lair
and
everything
takes
on
a
lupine
look
baring
gaunt
teeth
at
every
peaceful
nook
and
shaking
torrent
hair
at
every
little
brook
cancers
of
ulcerous
flame
his
eyes
and
hark
there
in
the
dark
the
ponderous
stir
of
metal
iron
feet
and
with
it
heard
around
the
world
the
beat
of
battle
sounds
that
mark
his
heart
advance
retreat
with
shrapnel
pipes
he
goes
his
monstrous
ways
and
screeching
plays
the
music
havoc
dances
to
and
following
with
his
crew
of
ravening
nights
and
days
horror
invades
the
blue
against
the
heaven
he
lifts
a
mailed
fist
and
writes
a
list
of
beautiful
cities
on
the
ghastly
sky
and
underneath
them
with
no
reason
why
in
blood
and
tears
and
mist
the
postscript
these
must
die
change
is
the
portion
and
chief
heritage
of
every
age
the
spirit
of
god
still
waits
its
and
war
may
blur
his
message
for
a
while
and
mar
the
writing
on
his
page
to
this
our
sorrowful
star
but
there
above
the
conflict
orbed
in
rays
is
drawn
the
face
of
peace
at
last
who
comes
into
her
own
peace
from
whose
tomb
the
world
shall
roll
the
stone
and
give
her
highest
place
in
the
human
heart
alone
belgian
happy
year
of
an
hour
from
dawn
the
snow
sweeps
on
as
it
swept
with
sleet
last
night
the
earth
around
breathes
never
a
sound
wrapped
in
its
shroud
of
white
a
waked
cock
crows
under
the
snows
then
after
while
the
sky
grows
blue
and
a
star
looks
through
with
a
kind
o
bitter
smile
a
whining
dog
an
axe
on
a
log
and
a
muffled
voice
that
calls
a
cow
long
low
then
footsteps
slow
stamping
into
the
stalls
a
bed
of
straw
where
the
wind
blows
raw
through
cracks
of
the
stable
door
a
child
small
cry
a
voice
nearby
that
says
one
mouth
the
more
a
different
note
in
a
man
rough
throat
as
he
turns
at
an
entering
tread
satyrs
see
my
woman
she
was
brought
last
night
to
bed
a
cry
of
halt
ach

a
spy
no
that
is
clear
there
a
good
i
the
jail
in
town
for
her
and
then
my
orders
here
a
shot
as
the
clouds
unfold
a
scream
and
a
cry
forlorn
clothed
red
with
fire
like
the
heart
desire
look
down
the
christmas
morn
the
babe
with
light
is
haloed
bright
and
it
is
christmas
day
a
cry
of
woe
then
footsteps
slow
and
the
wild
guns
far
away
festival
of
the
imperial
madness
will
of
hand
builds
vast
an
altar
here
and
rears
before
the
world
on
godly
land
a
moloch
form
of
blood
and
tears
and
far
as
eye
can
see
behold
priests
plunge
into
its
brazen
arms
men
that
its
iron
maw
of
mold
mangles
returning
horrible
forms
its
priests
are
armies
moving
slow
and
crowned
like
kings
in
and
theirs
it
is
to
make
it
flow
the
crimson
stream
of
sacrifice
cry
of
the
season
speaks
this
year
of
life
confusing
words
of
strife
suggesting
weeds
instead
of
fruits
and
flowers
in
all
earth
bowers
with
heart
of
jael
face
of
ruth
she
goes
her
way
uncouth
through
hills
and
fields
where
fog
and
sunset
seem
wild
smoke
and
steam
around
her
spotted
as
a
leopard
skin
she
draws
her
cloak
of
whin
and
through
the
dark
hills
sweeps
dusk
last
red
glare
wild
on
her
hair
her
hands
drip
leaves
like
blood
and
burn
with
frost
her
moony
urn
she
lifts
where
death
driving
stress
and
storm
rears
his
gaunt
form
and
all
night
long
she
seems
to
say
come
forth
my
winds
and
slay
and
everywhere
is
heard
the
wailing
cry
of
dreams
that
die
and
a
little
child
one
night
awoke
and
cried
oh
help
me
father
there
is
something
wild
before
me
help
me
hurrying
to
his
side
i
answered
i
am
here
you
dreamed
my
child
a
dream
he
questioned
oh
i
could
not
see
it
was
so
dark
take
me
into
your
bed
and
i
who
loved
him
held
him
soothingly
and
smiling
on
his
terror
comforted
he
nestled
in
my
arms
i
held
him
fast
and
spoke
to
him
and
calmed
his
childish
fears
until
he
smiled
again
asleep
at
last
upon
his
lashes
still
a
trace
of
tears
how
like
a
child
the
world
who
in
this
night
of
strife
beholds
strange
monsters
threatening
and
with
black
fear
having
so
little
light
cries
to
its
father
god
for
comforting
and
well
for
it
if
answering
the
call
the
father
hear
and
soothe
its
dread
asleep
how
many
though
whom
thoughts
and
dreams
appall
must
lie
awake
and
in
the
darkness
weep
rising
of
the
the
day
brims
high
its
ewer
of
blue
with
starry
light
and
crowns
as
king
that
hewer
of
clouds
which
take
their
flight
across
the
sky
old
night
and
tempest
there
who
houses
within
them
like
a
cave
lies
down
and
dreams
and
drowses
upon
the
earth
huge
grave
with
wandering
wind
and
wave
the
storm
moves
on
and
winging
from
out
the
east
a
bird
the
moon
drifts
calmly
bringing
a
message
and
a
word
of
peace
in
heaven
it
heard
of
peace
and
times
called
golden
whose
beauty
makes
it
glow
with
love
like
that
of
olden
which
mortals
used
to
know
there
in
the
the
battle
one
blossoming
like
a
beautiful
thought
nursed
in
a
broken
mind
that
waits
and
schemes
survives
though
shattered
and
about
it
caught
the
strangling
dodder
streams
gaunt
weeds
and
here
a
bayonet
or
pouch
rusty
and
rotting
where
men
fought
and
slew
bald
trampled
paths
that
seem
with
fear
to
crouch
feeling
a
bloody
dew
here
nothing
that
was
beauty
once
remains
war
left
the
garden
to
its
dead
alone
and
life
and
love
who
toiled
here
for
their
pains
have
nothing
once
their
own
death
leans
upon
the
battered
door
at
gaze
the
house
is
silent
where
there
once
was
stir
of
husbandry
that
led
laborious
days
with
love
for
comforter
now
in
love
place
death
old
and
halt
and
blind
gropes
searching
everywhere
for
what
may
war
left
it
empty
as
his
vacant
mind
it
has
no
more
to
give
iron
and
these
are
christians
god
the
horror
of
it
how
long
o
lord
how
long
o
lord
how
long
wilt
thou
endure
this
crime
and
there
above
it
look
down
on
earth
nor
sweep
away
the
wrong
are
these
thy
teachings
where
is
then
that
pity
which
bade
the
weary
suffering
come
to
thee
war
takes
its
toll
of
life
in
field
and
city
and
thou
must
see
o
christianity
and
then
the
children
oh
thou
art
another
not
god
but
fiend
whom
god
has
given
release
will
prayer
avail
naught
tears
of
father
mother
to
give
at
last
the
weary
world
surcease
from
butchery
that
back
again
hath
brought
her
into
that
age
barbarian
that
priced
hate
above
love
and
shod
with
steel
and
slaughter
stamped
on
the
cross
and
on
the
face
of
christ
black
clouds
hung
low
and
heavy
above
the
sunset
glare
and
in
the
garden
dimly
we
wandered
here
and
there
so
full
of
strife
of
trouble
the
night
was
dark
afraid
like
our
own
love
so
merely
for
tears
and
sighings
made
that
when
it
came
to
parting
and
i
must
mount
and
go
with
all
my
soul
i
wished
it
that
god
would
lay
me
low
certain
german
they
hold
their
own
they
have
no
peers
in
gloom
and
glow
in
hopes
and
fears
in
love
and
terror
hovering
round
the
lore
of
that
enchanted
ground
that
mystic
region
where
one
hears
by
bandit
towers
the
hunt
that
nears
wild
through
the
hartz
the
demon
cheers
of
hackelnberg
his
horn
and
hound
they
hold
their
own
dark
wallenstein
and
down
the
years
the
lorelei
and
creased
with
sneers
faust
margaret
the
sabboth
sound
of
the
brocken
drowned
in
storm
through
which
mephisto
leers
they
hold
their
own
opening
an
old
school
volume
of
i
had
forgot
how
in
my
day
the
sabine
fields
around
me
lay
in
amaranth
and
asphodel
with
many
a
cold
bandusian
well
by
the
in
forest
dells
of
faun
and
fay
how
lounging
in
the
fountain
spray
i
talked
with
horace
felt
his
spell
i
had
forgot
with
pyrrha
and
with
lydia
how
oft
i
sat
while
lalaga
sang
and
the
fine
falerian
fell
sparkling
and
heard
the
poet
tell
of
loves
whose
beauty
lasts
for
aye
i
had
forgot
in
her
vast
church
of
glimmering
blue
from
feet
to
chin
her
dark
locks
beaded
with
the
dew
the
dawn
comes
in
at
once
the
hills
put
on
their
spencers
of

never

beneath

i
worshiped
praying

striven
for

through
which
she
might
be
won

she
had
no
soul
a

as
fair

cruel
as
a

played
with
hearts
as
nothing
human
and
tossed
them
by
and
on
them
trod
she
killed
a
soul
she
did
it
nightly
luring
it
forth
from
peace
and
prayer
to
strangle
it
and
laughing
lightly
cast
it
into
the
gutter
there

before

at

i
heard
a
spirit
singing
as
beyond
the
morning
winging
its
radiant
form
went
swinging
like
a
star
in
its
song
prophetic
voices
mixed
their
sounds
with
as
when
loud
the
world
rejoices
after
war
and
it
said
i
hear
me
above
the
roar
of
cities
the
clamor
and
conflict
of
trade
the
frenzy
and
fury
of
commercialism
is
heard
my
voice
chanting
down
the
long
corridors
of
time
it
comes
bearing
my
message
bidding
the
soul
of
man
arise
to
the
realization
of
his
dream
now
and
then
discords
seem
to
intrude
and
tones
that
are
false
and
feeble
beginnings
of
the
perfect
chord
from
which
is
evolved
the
ideal
the
unattainable
hear
me
ever
and
ever
above
the
tumult
of
the
years
the
blatant
cacophonies
of
war
the
wrangling
of
politics
demons
and
spirits
of
unrest
my
song
persists
addressing
the
soul
with
the
urge
of
an
astral
something
supernal
elemental
promethean
instinct
with
an
everlasting
fire
ii
hear
me

am
the
expression
of
the
subconscious
the
utterance

the
intellect
the
voice

stands
for
civilization

my
singing
sprang
and
fearless
liberty
subduer
of
tyrants
who
feed
on
the
strength
of
nations
out
of
my
chanting
arose
as
aphrodite
arose
from
the
foam
of
the
ocean
the
dream
of
spiritual
desire
mother
of
knowledge
victor
hate
and
oppression
ancient
and
elemental
dæmons

with
ignorance

my

out

hoary
past

swiftly
surely

gather
the
evils
of

the
hydras
and

forgotten
and
buried
in
darkness
amorphous
of

tyrannies
and
superstitions
torturing
body

with

gargoyls

groaned
in
the
middle

death

hollow
eidolons
cruel
inhuman

the
faces

all
the
wrongs

shapes
make
hideous
the
cycles

error

darkness
devouring
the
manhood
of

demogorgons
of
war
and
misrule
blackening
the
world
with
blood
and
the
lust
of
destruction
hear
me
out
of
my
song
have
grown
beauty
and
joy
and
with
them
the
triumph
of
reason
the
confirmation
of
hope
of
faith
and
endeavor
the
dream
that
immortal
to
whose
creation
thought
gives
concrete

assumes

setting

her

on
what
is
blind
and
brute
still
holding

shall
be

no

for
what

means
to
man
for

for

all
that
can
make

superior
to
the
things
that
weight
the

down
things

hate
instead
of
love
for
which
the

may
she
demand
faith
and
inspire
it
song
to
lead
her
way
above
the
crags
of
wrong
into
the
broader

may
she
stand
for
poets
still
poets
that
now
the

needs
as
it
never
needed
such
an
one
as
he
large

with
firm

held
up

directing
deep
in

none
has
ever
heard
such
music
as
a
bird
gives
of
its

when
dying

so
let
her
rise
mother
of

still
above
all

self

through
deeds

thereby
bind
its

so
shall
she
win
a

with

to
a
