of
one
who
nearly
died
of
a
broken
heart
but
bronson

nearly
died
of
a
broken
dream
helen
bell
there
is
a
room
upstairs
in
the
old
house
at
fruitlands
in
harvard
massachusetts
where
the
visitors
pause
and
look
about
them
with
a
softening
glance
and
often
with
visible
emotion
as
though
they
felt
a
sudden
nearness
to
something
infinitely
intimate
and
personal
they
have
come
to
see
the
place
where
bronson
alcott
and
the
group
of
transcendentalists
cut
themselves
off
from
the
world
in
the
spring
of
and
tried
to
found
a
new
eden
where
evil
could
find
no
entrance
and
where
all
might
share
in
common
the
peace
of
an
industrious
simple
life
intermixed
with
study
and
close
to
the
heart
of
nature
a
spiritual
and
intellectual
center
where
mind
and
soul
could
grow
in
quiet
seclusion
yet
with
sympathetic
companionship
this
was
dream
the
comedy
and
tragedy
of
the
experiment
have
been
the
theme
of
many
a
magazine
article
and
years
have
come
and
gone
yet
hundreds
of
people
cross
the
pastures
to
the
lonely
spot
each
year
and
wander
through
the
house
and
listen
to
the
story
of
the
joy
of
the
first
glad
hopeful
days
and
the
pitiful
ending
of
this
philosopher
plan
for
an
earthly
paradise
there
is
so
much
that
is
quaint
to
see
and
seemingly
impossible
to
hear
for
there
were
some
strange
theories
worked
out
by
this
group
of
learned
men
that
a
sudden
outburst
of
surprise
and
amusement
will
break
into
the
recital
of
the
tale
but
in
the
room
upstairs
they
are
wont
to
grow
quiet
and
speak
in
lowered
voices
for
they
seem
to
feel
the
pathos
there
of
the
final
disillusionment
it
is
the
room
where
at
the
end
of
a
laborious
day
alcott
with
tired
eyes
sewed
and
sewed
night
after
night
by
the
light
of
her
one
flickering
lamp
and
where
bronson
alcott
deserted
by
his
followers
lay
in
his
bed
with
his
face
turned
to
the
wall
and
in
his
despair
over
the
bitter
failure
of
his
most
cherished
dream
called
upon
death
to
release
him
the
visitors
stand
and
look
at
alcott
lace
cap
on
the
table
by
the
window
and
the
little
cuffs
that
fell
over
her
busy
useful
hands
at
the
sewing
basket
left
where
she
might
have
laid
it
when
she
was
too
wearied
to
thread
another
needle
at
all
the
many
personal
things
belonging
to
them
both
that
speak
so
clearly
of
them
and
seem
to
bring
them
very
near
and
then
they
turn
to
read
the
manuscripts
and
letters
that
hang
upon
the
walls
for
on
the
walls
at
fruitlands
hang
various
original
manuscripts
that
as
yet
have
never
been
published
and
among
them
are
three
poems
by
louisa
alcott
bronson
alcott
noted
daughter
these
are
now
put
before
the
public
for
the
first
time
and
surely
they
must
stir
a
warm
response
in
the
most
indifferent
heart
indelibly
impressed
upon
louisa
alcott
memory
were
those
days
at
fruitlands
when
her
childish
feet
ran
swiftly
over
the
pastures
and
through
the
pine
grove
and
where
in
the
early
mornings
she
sat
upon
a
granite
boulder
far
up
on
the
hill
and
thought
thoughts
so
her
diary
tells
us
she
afterwards
was
frequently
heard
to
say
that
it
was
in
those
days
at
fruitlands
that
the
seeds
of
her
literary
talents
were
sown
which
were
to
meet
with
such
heartfelt
appreciation
from
the
reading
public
and
were
to
give
such
solace
and
comfort
to
the
old
age
of
her
gifted
father
and
devoted
mother
her
love
and
reverence
for
her
father
and
her
pride
in
his
attainments
were
very
beautiful
and
in
order
to
appreciate
what
it
was
in
him
that
inspired
this
great
sentiment
not
only
in
his
daughter
but
in
so
many
leading
men
of
that
time
the
eccentricities
of
the
man
whom
the
world
called
unpractical
and
visionary
must
be
forgotten
so
as
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
alcott
who
was
the
intimate
friend
of
emerson
a
genius
a
philosopher
an
optimist
in
spite
of
failure
and
in
spite
of
opposition
therefore
it
seems
best
to
give
some
extracts
from
his
own
writings
first
that
will
reveal
the
tenor
of
his
mind
and
the
largeness
of
his
heart
and
intellect
in
order
that
the
poems
of
the
daughter
may
be
more
fully
understood
the
following
extracts
are
from
his
book
entitled
tablets
if
one
life
is
not
worshipful
he
writes
no
one
cares
for
his
professions
we
recognize
goodness
wherever
we
find
it
is
the
same
helpful
influence
beautifying
the
meanest
as
the
greatest
service
by
its
manners
as
if
it
did
it
not
enthusiasm
is
existence
earnestness
life
exceeding
great
reward
our
dispositions
are
the
atmosphere
we
breathe
and
we
carry
our
climate
and
world
in
ourselves
good
humor
gay
spirits
are
the
liberators
the
sure
cure
for
spleen
and
melancholy
and
he
who
smiles
is
never
beyond
redemption
the
liberal
mind
is
of
no
sect
it
shows
to
sects
their
departure
from
the
ideal
standard
and
thus
maintains
pure
religion
in
the
world
but
there
are
those
whose
minds
like
the
pupil
of
the
eye
contract
as
the
light
increases
is
a
poor
egotism
that
sees
only
its
own
image
reflected
in
its
vision
as
thou
beest
it
thou
seest
it
one
can
not
be
well
read
unless
well
seasoned
in
thought
and
experience
life
makes
the
man
and
he
must
have
lived
in
all
his
gifts
and
become
acclimated
herein
to
profit
by
his
readings
living
at
the
breadth
of
shakespeare
the
depth
of
plato
the
height
of
christ
gives
the
mastery
or
if
not
that
a
worthy
discipleship
and
here
is
a
quotation
that
reveals
his
great
and
beautiful
love
of
nature
nature
is
the
good
baptist
plunging
us
in
her
jordan
streams
to
be
purified
of
our
stains
and
fulfil
all
righteousness
and
wheresoever
our
lodge
there
is
but
the
thin
casement
between
us
and
immensity
nature
without
mind
within
inviting
us
forth
into
the
solacing
air
the
blue
ether
if
we
will
but
shake
our
sloth
and
cares
aside
and
step
forth
into
her
great
contentments
these
are
enough
to
show
the
rarified
atmosphere
of
his
thought
world
he
lived
upon
the
hilltops
so
to
speak
and
it
is
curious
to
note
that
in
spite
of
its
derision
the
world
has
come
to
value
many
of
his
ideas
which
at
first
were
deemed
but
foolishness
the
importance
of
taste
and
beauty
in
the
schoolroom
for
instance
is
now
accepted
throughout
the
world
yet
when
he
first
preached
this
what
was
then
a
new
idea
and
had
the
walls
of
his
temple
school
in
boston
tinted
in
restful
colors
and
placed
the
busts
of
socrates
and
plato
and
other
learned
philosophers
where
they
could
be
looked
upon
with
reverence
by
his
pupils
it
was
thought
to
be
absurd
and
even
dangerous
for
the
old
regime
of
schoolrooms
with
bare
forbidding
walls
was
at
its
height
so
also
with
one
of
his
theories
of
farming
he
advocated
growing
buckwheat
and
turning
the
crop
back
into
the
soil
in
order
to
enrich
the
land
and
all
the
farmers
threw
their
hands
up
as
though
he
had
lost
his
reason
yet
only
a
year
ago
when
the
nations
were
at
war
the
agricultural
department
in
washington
sent
out
bulletins
urging
farmers
to
do
this
very
thing
as
an
admirable
and
inexpensive
method
to
pursue
illustration
of
bronson
alcott
famous
temple
school
boston
where
he
taught
his
philosophy
to
young
boys
and
girls
it
was
the
first
school
to
be
decorated
and
furnished
with
artistic
taste
and
he
believed
it
developed
a
sense
of
beauty
and
refinement
the
school
was
in
the
masonic
the
fundamental
principle
of
his
dietary
system
was
the
exclusive
use
of
fruits
vegetables
and
all
kinds
of
grain
eliminating
all
animal
food
while
this
was
carried
to
excess
the
idea
of
it
does
not
sound
so
very
strange
to
modern
ears
there
being
plenty
of
vegetarians
now
to
commend
the
theory
these
things
are
mentioned
in
order
to
show
that
in
spite
of
much
that
was
wholly
unpractical
he
advocated
many
theories
that
have
not
died
but
have
taken
root
it
was
the
intuitive
consciousness
of
the
sincerity
of
his
appeal
to
the
world
that
drew
his
daughter
louisa
so
closely
to
him
and
led
her
to
express
herself
so
touchingly
in
the
following
poems
a

a
written
by
louisa
alcott
to
her
like
bunyan
pilgrim
with
his
pack
forth
went
the
dreaming
youth
to
seek
to
find
and
make
his
own
wisdom
virtue
and
truth
life
was
his
book
and
patiently
he
studied
each
hard
page
by
turns
reformer
outcast
priest
philosopher
and
sage
christ
was
his
master
and
he
made
his
life
a
gospel
sweet
plato
and
pythagoras
in
him
found
a
disciple
meet
the
noblest
and
best
his
friends
faithful
and
fond
though
few
eager
to
listen
learn
and
pay
the
love
and
honor
due
power
and
place
silver
and
gold
he
neither
asked
nor
sought
only
to
serve
his
fellowmen
with
heart
and
word
and
thought
a
pilgrim
still
but
in
his
pack
no
sins
to
frighten
or
oppress
but
wisdom
morals
piety
to
teach
to
warn
and
bless
the
world
passed
by
nor
cared
to
take
the
treasure
he
could
give
apart
he
sat
content
to
wait
and
beautifully
live
unsaddened
by
long
lonely
years
of
want
neglect
and
wrong
his
soul
to
him
a
kingdom
was
steadfast
serene
and
strong
magnanimous
and
pure
his
life
tranquil
its
happy
end
patience
and
peace
his
handmaids
were
death
an
immortal
friend
for
him
no
monuments
need
rise
no
laurels
make
his
pall
the
of
the
good
and
wise
outshines
outlives
them
all
the
explanation
of
the
following
poem
seems
to
give
added
color
to
it
alcott
had
a
habit
of
cutting
his
own
hair
a
feat
that
can
certainly
be
called
unusual
and
it
was
after
one
of
these
occasions
that
miss
alcott
picked
up
the
curl
and
pasted
it
on
the
corner
of
the
paper
upon
which
the
poem
is
written
written
by
louisa
a
little
grey
curl
a
little
grey
curl
from
my
father
head
i
find
unburned
on
the
hearth
and
give
it
a
place
in
my
diary
here
with
a
feeling
half
sadness
half
mirth
for
the
long
white
locks
are
our
special
pride
though
he
smiles
at
his
daughter
praise
but
oh
they
have
grown
each
year
more
thin
till
they
are
now
but
a
silvery
haze
that
wise
old
head
though
it
does
grow
bald
with
the
knocks
hard
fortune
may
give
has
a
store
of
faith
and
hope
and
trust
which
have
taught
him
how
to
live
though
the
hat
be
old
there
a
face
below
which
telleth
to
those
who
look
the
history
of
a
good
man
life
and
it
cheers
like
a
blessed
book
a
a
peddler
of
jewels
of
clocks
and
of
books
many
a
year
of
his
wandering
youth
a
peddler
still
with
a
far
richer
pack
his
wares
are
wisdom
and
love
and
truth
but
now
as
then
few
purchase
or
pause
for
he
can
not
learn
the
tricks
of
trade
little
silver
he
wins
but
that
which
time
is
sprinkling
thick
on
his
meek
old
head
but
there
come
a
day
when
the
busy
world
grown
sick
with
its
folly
and
pride
will
remember
the
peddler
then
whom
it
rudely
had
set
aside
will
remember
the
wares
he
offered
it
once
and
will
seek
to
find
him
again
eager
to
purchase
truth
wisdom
and
love
but
oh
it
will
seek
him
in
vain
it
will
find
but
his
footsteps
left
behind
along
the
byways
of
life
where
he
patiently
walked
striving
the
while
to
quiet
its
tumult
and
strife
but
the
peddling
pilgrim
has
laid
down
his
pack
and
gone
with
his
earnings
away
how
small
will
they
seem
remembering
the
debt
which
the
world
too
late
would
repay
god
bless
the
dear
head
and
crown
it
with
years
untroubled
and
calmly
serene
that
the
autumn
of
life
more
golden
may
be
for
the
heats
and
the
storms
that
have
been
my
heritage
none
can
ever
dispute
my
fortune

strife
