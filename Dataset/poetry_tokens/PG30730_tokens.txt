printed
in
the
introduction
the
rev
mark
mcneal
who
was
one
of
the
successors
of
lafcadio
hearn
in
the
chair
of
english
literature
at
the
tokyo
imperial
university
in
an
interesting
article
recounts
the
following
incident
of
his
experience
in
that
institution
i
was
seated
on
the
examining
board
with
professor
ichikawa
the
dean
of
the
english
department
there
entered
the
room
a
student
whom
i
recognized
as
among
the
best
in
the
class
a
sharp
young
chap
with
big
mongolian
eyes
and
one
who
had
never
to
my
knowledge
given
any
hint
of
even
a
leaning
toward
christianity
i
remembered
however
that
his
thesis
submitted
for
a
degree
had
been
a
study
of
francis
thompson
following
the
usual
custom
i
began
to
question
him
about
his
thesis
did
you
choose
thompson
he
is
quite
a
famous
poet
kind
of
poet
is
he
might
call
him
a
mystic
he
a
mystic
of
the
orthodox
sort
like
cynewulf
or
crashaw
or
an
unorthodox
mystic
like
blake
or
shelley
he
orthodox
now
what
do
you
consider
his
greatest
production
i
should
say
the
hound
of
heaven
what
on
earth
does
thompson
mean
by
that
hound
means
god
is
not
that
a
rather
irreverent
way
for
thompson
to
be
talking
about
god
calling
him
a
hound
what
does
he
mean
by
comparing
god
to
a
hound
he
means
the
pursuit
of
god
i
see
thompson
is
pursuing
god
is
he
no
he
is
rather
running
away
from
god
then
god
is
pursuing
thompson
is
that
it
that
it
illustration
titanic
glooms
of
chasmèd
fears
but
see
here
according
to
thompson
belief
god
is
everywhere
is
he
then
how
can
god
be
going
after
thompson
is
it
a
physical
pursuit
it
is
a
moral
pursuit
moral
pursuit
what
that
what
is
god
after
is
after
thompson
love
and
then
we
the
jesuit
and
the
buddhist
began
to
follow
the
windings
and
turnings
of
that
wondrous
poem
the
most
mystic
and
spiritual
thing
that
has
been
written
since
teresa
laid
down
her
pen
what
the
other
member
of
the
examining
board
thought
of
it
all
i
never
heard
but
i
think
i
acquired
a
satisfactory
answer
to
that
question
so
often
put
to
me
can
the
japanese
really
grasp
a
spiritual
truth
do
they
really
get
at
the
meaning
of
christianity
this
of
a
race
that
has
produced
more
martyrs
than
any
other
nation
since
the
fall
of
rome
and
that
kept
the
faith
for
two
centuries
without
a
visible
symbol
or
document
the
incident
supplies
matter
for
other
conclusions
more
germane
to
the
subject
of
this
essay
the
late
bert
leston
taylor
a
journalist
whose
journalism
had
a
literary
facet
of
critical
brilliance
once
declared
that
he
could
not
perceive
the
excellence
of
francis
thompson
poetry
when
someone
suggested
that
it
might
be
that
he
was
not
spiritual
enough
the
retort
was
laconic
and
crushing
or
perhaps
not
ecclesiastical
enough
like
most
good
retorts
taylor
had
more
wit
than
truth
he
was
obsessed
by
the
notion
prevalent
among
a
certain
class
of
literary
critics
that
francis
thompson
fame
was
the
artificially
stimulated
applause
of
a
catholic
coterie
whose
enthusiasm
could
hardly
be
shared
by
readers
with
no
particular
curiosity
about
catholic
ideas
or
modes
of
religion
it
was
probably
this
obsession
which
prompted
that
able
critic
traill
to
write
to
wilfrid
meynell
when
the
hound
of
heaven
first
appeared
i
quite
agree
with
you
in
thinking
him
a
remarkable
poet
but
if
he
is
ever
to
become
other
than
a
poet
or
poet
if
indeed
it
is
worth
anyone
ambition
to
be
other
than
that
it
will
only
be
by
working
in
a
different
manner
a
to
appreciate
the
of
heaven
is
to
me
inconceivable
william
archer
an
experienced
judge
of
popular
likes
was
of
the
same
opinion
yet
francis
thompson
biographer
tells
us
in
the
three
years
after
thompson
death
the
separate
edition
of
the
of
heaven
sold
fifty
thousand
copies
and
apart
from
anthologies
many
more
thousands
were
sold
of
the
books
containing
it
when
the
hound
of
heaven
is
selected
for
study
and
explained
in
words
of
one
syllable
by
a
young
japanese
student
in
the
tokyo
imperial
university
almost
thirty
years
after
the
poem
was
published
one
can
hardly
maintain
that
it
calls
for
certain
ecclesiastical
affiliations
before
it
can
be
understood
and
felt
or
that
its
public
is
necessarily
circumscribed
it
must
be
owned
indeed
that
francis
thompson
was
a
puzzle
to
his
contemporaries
of
the
nineties
he
paid
the
usual
penalty
of
vaulting
originality
the
decade
is
famous
for
its
bold
experiments
and
shining
successes
in
the
art
of
poetry
one
might
expect
that
a
public
grown
accustomed
to
exquisitely
wrought
novelties
and
eager
to
extend
them
a
welcome
would
have
been
preordained
to
recognize
and
hail
the
genius
of
thompson
but
it
was
not
so
the
estheticism
of
the
nineties
for
all
its
sweet
and
fragile
flowers
was
rooted
in
the
dark
passions
of
the
flesh
its
language
was
the
language
of
death
and
despair
and
annihilation
and
the
epicurean
need
of
exhausting
the
hedonistic
possibilities
of
life
ere
the
final
engulfing
in
darkness
and
silence
when
the
speech
of
thompson
laden
with
religion
and
spirituality
and
christian
mystery
broke
with
golden
turbulence
upon
the
world
of
the
nineties
the
critics
were
abashed
and
knew
not
what
to
think
of
it
the
effect
was
somewhat
like
that
produced
by
attwater
in
the
when
he
began
suddenly
to
discourse
on
divine
grace
to
the
amazement
of
herrick
and
his
crew
of
scoundrels
from
the
stolen
oh
exclaimed
the
unspeakable
huish
when
they
had
recovered
breath
oh
look
turn
down
the
lights
at
once
and
the
band
of
will
oblige
this
ai
a
spiritual
séance
it
had
something
akin
to
the
madness
of
poor
christopher
smart
when
he
fell
into
the
habit
of
dropping
on
his
knees
and
praying
in
the
crowded
london
streets
there
was
incongruity
verging
on
the
indecent
in
this
intrusion
of
religion
into
art
as
if
an
archangel
were
to
attend
an
afternoon
tea
in
mayfair
or
an
absinthe
session
in
a
bohemian
cafe
it
was
in
johnson
phrase
an
unnecessary
deviation
from
the
usual
modes
of
the
world
which
struck
the
world
dumb
the
poetry
of
francis
thompson
appeared
in
three
small
volumes
poems
published
in
sister
songs
in
and
new
poems
in
the
first
of
these
volumes
contained
the
hound
of
heaven
though
it
staggered
reviewers
at
large
they
yielded
dubious
and
carefully
measured
praise
and
waited
for
developments
the
pack
was
unleashed
and
the
raised
on
the
coming
of
sister
songs
and
new
poems
andrew
lang
and
arthur
symons
led
the
chorus
of
disapproval
it
is
amusing
to
read
now
that
francis
thompson
faults
are
fundamental
though
he
uses
the
treasure
of
the
temple
he
is
not
a
religious
poet
the
note
of
a
true
spiritual
passion
never
once
sounds
in
his
book
another
critic
of
the
poet
declares
that
nothing
could
be
stronger
than
his
language
nothing
weaker
than
the
impression
it
leaves
on
the
mind
it
is
like
a
dictionary
of
obsolete
english
suffering
from
a
severe
fit
of
delirium
tremens
a
prominent
literary
periodical
saw
in
the
attempt
to
foist
thompson
on
the
public
as
a
genuine
poet
a
sectarian
effort
to
undermine
the
literary
press
of
england
in
the
course
of
a
year
the
sale
of
sister
songs
amounted
to
copies
the
new
poems
fared
worse
its
sale
never
large
practically
ceased
a
few
years
after
its
appearance
three
copies
being
sold
during
the
first
six
months
of
illustration
across
the
margent
of
the
world
i
fled
and
all
this
despite
strong
recommendations
from
fastidious
quarters
george
meredith
recognition
was
instantaneous
and
unreserved
henley
was
accompanied
by
reproofs
richard
legallienne
was
enthusiastic
william
archer
said
to
a
friend
this
is
not
work
which
can
possibly
be
in
the
wide
sense
but
it
is
work
that
will
be
read
and
treasured
centuries
hence
by
those
who
really
care
for
poetry
and
he
wrote
to
thompson
i
assure
you
no
conceivable
reaction
can
wipe
out
or
overlay
such
work
as
yours
it
is
on
the
rock
of
absolute
beauty
and
this
i
say
all
the
more
confidently
because
it
does
not
happen
to
appeal
to
my
own
speculative
or
even
my
own
literary
prejudices
the
most
extravagant
admirer
of
all
and
the
one
who
will
probably
turn
out
to
have
come
nearer
the
mark
than
any
of
francis
thompson
contemporaries
was
garvin
the
well
known
english
in
politics
and
literature
after
the
publication
of
his
second
volume
he
wrote
in
the
english
march
when
it
became
clear
that
the
of
and
songs
should
be
read
together
as
a
strict
lyrical
sequence
there
was
no
longer
any
comparison
possible
except
the
highest
the
inevitable
comparison
with
even
shakespeare
sonnets
the
sonnets
are
the
greatest
soliloquy
in
literature
the
of
heaven
and
songs
are
the
second
greatest
and
there
is
no
third
in
each
case
it
is
rather
consciousness
imaged
in
the
magic
mirror
of
poetry
than
explicit
autobiography
even
with
the
greatest
pages
of
songs
sounding
in
one
ears
one
is
sometimes
tempted
to
think
the
of
heaven
mark
for
unimaginable
beauty
and
tremendous
import
if
we
do
damnably
iterate
thompson
tremendousness
we
can
not
help
it
he
thrusts
the
word
upon
us
we
do
not
think
we
forget
any
of
the
splendid
things
of
an
english
anthology
when
we
say
that
the
of
heaven
seems
to
us
on
the
whole
the
most
wonderful
lyric
if
we
consider
songs
as
a
sequence
of
lyrics
in
the
language
it
fingers
all
the
stops
of
the
spirit
and
we
hear
now
a
thrilling
and
dolorous
note
of
doom
and
now
the
quiring
of
the
spheres
and
now
the
very
pipes
of
pan
but
under
all
the
still
sad
music
of
humanity
it
is
the
return
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
thomas
à
kempis
the
regal
air
the
prophetic
ardors
the
apocalyptic
vision
thompson
has
them
all
a
rarer
more
intense
more
strictly
predestinate
genius
has
never
been
known
to
poetry
to
many
this
will
seem
the
simple
delirium
of
the
writer
signs
for
those
others
nowise
ashamed
who
range
after
shakespeare
very
sonnets
the
poetry
of
a
living
poet
francis
thompson
we
do
not
associate
arnold
bennett
with
any
of
the
ideas
in
religion
or
literature
which
supplied
impulse
to
francis
thompson
it
is
a
surprise
of
the
first
magnitude
to
find
him
carried
away
into
the
rapture
of
prophecy
by
the
sister
songs
i
declare
he
says
in
an
article
appearing
in
july
that
for
three
days
after
this
book
appeared
i
read
nothing
else
i
went
about
repeating
snatches
of
it
snatches
such
as
innocent
moon
that
nothing
does
but
shine
moves
all
the
labouring
surges
of
the
world
my
belief
is
that
francis
thompson
has
a
richer
natural
genius
a
finer
poetical
equipment
than
any
poet
save
shakespeare
show
me
the
divinest
glories
of
shelley
and
keats
even
of
tennyson
who
wrote
the
eaters
and
the
songs
in
the
and
i
think
i
can
match
them
all
out
of
this
one
book
this
little
book
that
can
be
bought
at
an
ordinary
bookseller
shop
for
an
ordinary
prosaic
crown
i
fear
that
in
thus
extolling
francis
thompson
work
i
am
grossly
outraging
the
canons
of
criticism
for
the
man
is
alive
he
gets
up
of
a
morning
like
common
mortals
not
improbably
he
eats
bacon
for
breakfast
and
every
critic
with
an
atom
of
discretion
knows
that
a
poet
must
not
be
called
great
until
he
is
dead
or
very
old
well
please
yourself
what
you
think
but
in
time
to
come
do
say
i
did
tell
you
a
whole
generation
of
men
has
passed
away
since
these
words
appeared
but
they
do
not
seem
to
be
so
fantastic
and
whimsical
now
as
they
seemed
to
be
then
illustration
i
said
to
dawn
be
sudden
it
can
scarcely
be
claimed
that
the
prophecies
of
meredith
garvin
and
arnold
bennett
were
of
the
kind
which
ultimately
assures
the
event
the
dipped
curiously
into
the
pages
about
which
there
was
so
much
conflict
of
opinion
it
was
startled
and
bewildered
by
a
novel
and
difficult
form
of
verse
and
finally
it
agreed
with
the
majority
of
critics
that
it
was
mostly
nonsense
too
catholic
to
be
catholic
the
poems
sold
badly
the
of
heaven
faring
best
it
is
a
common
mark
of
genius
to
be
ahead
of
its
time
even
coreligionists
were
cold
indeed
it
may
be
said
they
were
the
coldest
if
the
general
of
the
nineties
suspected
thompson
of
being
a
victorian
reactionary
of
mould
the
catholic
public
feared
him
for
his
art
it
was
a
wild
unfettered
thing
which
took
strange
liberties
with
catholic
pieties
and
could
not
be
trusted
to
run
in
divine
grooves
one
can
afford
to
extenuate
the
attitude
of
reserve
it
was
a
period
when
brilliant
heterodoxies
and
flaunting
decadence
were
in
the
air
the
fact
is
that
critics
and
public
delivered
thompson
over
to
the
catholics
and
the
catholics
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
canon
sheehan
could
write
of
thompson
in
only
two
catholics
literary
catholics
have
noticed
this
surprising
genius
coventry
patmore
and
wilfrid
meynell
the
vast
bulk
of
our
coreligionists
have
not
even
heard
his
name
although
it
is
already
bruited
amongst
the
immortals
and
the
great
catholic
poet
for
whose
advent
we
have
been
straining
our
vision
has
passed
beneath
our
eyes
sung
his
immortal
songs
and
vanished
this
was
written
almost
ten
years
before
thompson
died
but
after
his
resolve
to
write
no
more
poetry
it
is
easily
within
the
probabilities
that
small
as
was
audience
during
his
lifetime
it
would
have
been
still
smaller
but
for
the
extraneous
interest
excited
by
the
strange
story
of
his
life
he
was
born
on
december
in
preston
lancashire
whence
he
went
at
the
age
of
eleven
to
ushaw
college
a
catholic
boarding
school
for
boys
this
is
the
college
where
lafcadio
hearn
received
his
education
he
had
left
the
school
a
year
or
two
before
young
thompson
arrival
both
boys
were
designed
for
the
priesthood
hearn
lost
his
faith
then
or
shortly
afterwards
thompson
irregular
habits
of
dreamy
abstraction
rendered
him
unfit
for
a
sacerdotal
career
when
he
had
completed
his
course
at
college
where
he
had
distinguished
himself
in
english
composition
and
attained
respectable
standing
in
the
classics
his
father
a
physician
entered
the
lad
now
eighteen
as
a
student
of
medicine
in
owen
college
manchester
the
thompson
family
had
moved
from
preston
to
where
proximity
to
manchester
made
it
possible
for
the
young
medical
student
to
spend
his
nights
at
home
francis
was
of
the
silent
and
secretive
sort
where
he
could
not
hope
to
find
intelligent
sympathy
this
and
some
cloudy
compromise
with
his
sense
of
filial
dutifulness
will
perhaps
explain
why
he
passed
six
years
as
a
student
of
medicine
without
any
serious
purpose
of
becoming
a
physician
and
without
informing
his
father
of
his
disinclination
three
examinations
and
three
failures
at
intervals
of
a
year
were
necessary
to
convince
the
father
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
stern
measures
were
adopted
and
although
the
consequences
were
pitifully
tragical
it
is
hard
to
blame
the
father
of
francis
how
are
we
to
discover
the
extraordinary
seal
in
a
case
that
requires
special
and
extraordinary
treatment
francis
was
years
old
with
no
more
idea
than
a
child
of
how
life
is
planned
on
practical
lines
of
prosperity
the
senior
thompson
thought
it
time
for
him
to
learn
and
issued
orders
to
find
employment
of
some
remunerative
kind
accordingly
during
the
next
two
years
francis
served
indifferently
for
brief
periods
as
a
clerk
in
the
shop
of
a
maker
of
surgical
instruments
and
as
a
canvasser
of
an
encyclopedia
both
experiments
in
the
art
of
making
a
living
were
failures
increasing
paternal
dissatisfaction
the
desperate
young
man
then
enlisted
in
the
army
and
after
a
few
weeks
of
drilling
was
rejected
on
the
score
of
physical
weakness
illustration
i
knew
how
the
clouds
arise
spumèd
of
the
wild
during
these
shiftless
and
unhappy
years
as
a
listless
medical
student
and
laggard
apprentice
the
poet
chief
solace
was
the
public
library
of
manchester
in
his
daily
absences
from
home
his
misery
suggested
another
solace
of
a
sinister
kind
after
a
severe
illness
during
his
second
year
of
medicine
his
mother
says
his
biographer
presented
him
with
a
copy
of
de
quincey
confessions
of
an
opium
eater
it
is
incredible
that
a
like
thompson
should
have
reached
the
age
of
twenty
without
ever
having
read
a
book
which
is
one
of
the
first
to
attract
every
bright
this
would
be
particularly
true
of
a
who
lived
near
manchester
de
quincey
own
town
but
the
evidence
seems
to
be
against
probabilities
thompson
succumbed
completely
to
the
influence
of
the
great
genius
whose
temper
and
circumstances
of
life
were
singularly
like
his
own
experiments
in
laudanum
were
made
and
habits
contracted
which
accentuated
a
natural
unfitness
to
wrestle
with
the
practical
problems
of
getting
on
and
rendered
family
intercourse
drearier
than
ever
in
when
he
was
years
old
francis
decided
to
leave
home
after
a
week
in
manchester
he
requested
and
received
from
his
father
the
price
of
a
railway
ticket
for
london
the
trip
to
the
vast
and
strange
city
must
have
been
made
with
only
the
vaguest
of
plans
for
the
future
the
despairing
youth
seemed
to
have
no
other
purpose
than
to
rid
his
father
of
his
vexatious
presence
there
were
friends
in
london
on
one
of
whom
francis
was
directed
to
call
for
a
weekly
allowance
from
home
but
a
temperamental
reluctance
kept
the
young
man
away
from
those
who
could
help
him
and
even
the
weekly
allowance
after
a
while
came
to
be
unclaimed
the
rough
cyclonic
forces
of
the
huge
city
caught
this
helpless
child
of
a
man
years
in
the
full
swing
of
their
blind
sweep
and
played
sad
tricks
with
him
in
a
period
extending
over
nearly
three
years
francis
thompson
led
the
life
of
a
vagrant
in
the
streets
and
alleys
he
made
one
or
two
brave
essays
at
regular
work
of
the
most
commonplace
character
but
without
success
the
worn
copies
of
aeschylus
and
blake
in
the
pockets
of
this
ragged
and
gaunt
roustabout
contained
no
useful
hints
for
the
difficulties
of
the
peculiar
situation
its
harshness
could
be
transmuted
into
temporary
and
blessed
oblivion
by
a
drug
whenever
the
means
for
purchase
could
be
acquired
the
guildhall
library
was
much
frequented
until
shabbiness
was
excluded
by
the
policeman
this
outcast
poet
approaching
thirty
years
of
age
was
at
various
times
a
bootblack
a
newsboy
a
vendor
of
matches
a
nocturnal
denizen
of
wharves
and
lounger
on
the
benches
of
his
frame
was
the
exposed
target
of
cold
and
rain
and
winds
he
became
used
to
hunger
at
one
time
a
for
holding
a
horse
was
his
only
earnings
for
a
week
it
was
while
he
was
aimlessly
roaming
the
streets
one
night
almost
delirious
from
starvation
that
a
prosperous
benevolently
engaged
in
religious
came
across
thompson
and
struck
by
the
incongruity
of
his
gentle
speech
induced
him
to
accept
employment
in
his
shop
but
one
can
not
allow
business
to
suffer
on
account
of
an
inveterate
blunderer
even
though
the
blunderer
wear
wings
and
has
endeared
himself
to
the
family
mcmaster
kindly
anglican
who
deserves
grateful
remembrance
for
recognizing
and
temporarily
helping
merit
under
the
most
deceptive
disguise
was
obliged
much
against
his
inclination
to
dismiss
francis
and
to
allow
him
to
fall
back
into
the
pit
of
squalor
and
vagabondage
but
the
few
months
of
reprieve
had
supplied
thompson
with
the
impulse
to
write
shortly
after
he
was
dropped
from
the
mcmaster
establishment
wilfrid
meynell
the
editor
of
a
catholic
magazine
received
the
following
letter
dear
sir
in
enclosing
the
accompanying
article
for
your
inspection
i
must
ask
pardon
for
the
soiled
state
of
the
manuscript
it
is
due
not
to
slovenliness
but
to
the
strange
places
and
circumstances
under
which
it
has
been
written
for
me
no
less
than
parolles
the
dirty
nurse
experience
has
something
fouled
i
enclose
stamped
envelope
for
a
reply
since
i
do
not
desire
the
return
of
the
manuscript
regarding
your
judgment
of
its
worthlessness
as
quite
final
i
can
hardly
expect
that
where
my
prose
fails
my
verse
will
succeed
nevertheless
on
the
principle
of
will
i
try
the
last
i
have
added
a
few
specimens
of
it
with
the
off
chance
that
one
may
be
less
poor
than
the
rest
apologizing
very
sincerely
for
any
intrusion
on
your
valuable
time
i
remain
yours
with
little
hope
francis
thompson
kindly
address
your
rejection
to
the
charing
cross
post
office
illustration
naked
i
wait
thy
love
uplifted
stroke
smitten
me
to
my
knee
i
am
defenceless
utterly
the
unpromising
aspect
of
the
manuscript
thus
introduced
was
the
occasion
of
editorial
neglect
for
some
months
when
at
last
meynell
gave
it
his
attention
he
was
electrified
into
action
he
wrote
to
the
address
given
by
thompson
the
letter
was
returned
from
the
office
after
many
days
then
he
published
one
of
the
poems
mentioned
in
the
letter
the
passion
of
mary
in
the
hope
that
the
author
would
disclose
his
whereabouts
the
plan
succeeded
and
brought
a
letter
from
thompson
with
a
new
address
meynell
tried
to
waylay
him
at
the
new
address
a
chemist
shop
in
drury
lane
but
with
characteristic
shiftlessness
the
poet
forgot
to
call
there
for
possible
letters
but
the
seller
of
drugs
finally
established
communications
between
the
editor
and
the
poet
and
one
day
more
than
a
year
after
thompson
first
literary
venture
had
been
sent
he
visited
the
office
of
everard
meynell
the
poet
biographer
thus
describes
the
entrance
of
the
poet
into
his
father
sanctum
my
father
was
told
that
thompson
wished
to
see
him
him
up
he
said
and
was
left
alone
then
the
door
opened
and
a
strange
hand
was
thrust
in
the
door
closed
but
thompson
had
not
entered
again
it
opened
again
it
shut
at
the
third
attempt
a
waif
of
a
man
came
in
no
such
figure
had
been
looked
for
more
ragged
and
unkempt
than
the
average
beggar
with
no
shirt
beneath
his
coat
and
bare
feet
in
broken
shoes
he
found
my
father
at
a
loss
for
words
must
have
had
access
to
many
books
when
you
wrote
that
essay
was
what
he
said
said
thompson
his
shyness
at
once
replaced
by
an
acerbity
that
afterwards
became
one
of
the
most
familiar
of
his
mannerisms
is
precisely
where
the
essay
fails
i
had
no
books
by
me
at
the
time
save
aeschylus
and
blake
there
was
little
to
be
done
for
him
at
that
interview
save
the
extraction
of
a
promise
to
call
again
he
made
none
of
the
confidences
characteristic
of
a
man
seeking
sympathy
and
alms
he
was
secretive
and
with
no
eagerness
for
plans
for
his
benefit
and
refused
the
offer
of
a
small
weekly
sum
that
would
enable
him
to
sleep
in
a
bed
and
sit
at
a
table
by
patience
and
delicately
offered
kindnesses
and
meynell
at
length
won
the
difficult
privilege
of
helping
the
shy
nervous
spirit
wandering
in
pain
hunger
and
exile
amid
the
indecencies
of
extreme
penury
in
a
great
city
they
were
helped
by
the
friendly
sympathy
and
care
of
premonstratensian
and
franciscan
monks
thompson
had
sounded
and
become
familiar
with
the
depths
of
social
degradation
in
all
its
external
aspects
of
sordidness
the
most
extraordinary
part
of
his
singular
experience
is
that
he
affords
a
striking
instance
of
the
triumph
of
soul
and
mind
over
beleaguering
circumstance
the
nightmare
of
his
environment
failed
to
subdue
him
he
preserved
his
spiritual
sensitiveness
and
literary
ideals
of
a
most
exalted
kind
through
the
most
depressing
and
demoralizing
experiences
the
following
passage
in
that
first
essay
offered
to
meynell
entitled
paganism
old
and
new
a
vindication
of
christian
over
pagan
ideals
in
art
shows
the
rich
colorful
tone
of
mind
of
one
who
could
walk
unstained
among
the
world
impurities
bring
back
then
i
say
in
conclusion
even
the
best
age
of
paganism
and
you
smite
beauty
on
the
cheek
but
you
bring
back
the
best
age
of
paganism
the
age
when
paganism
was
a
faith
none
will
again
behold
apollo
in
the
forefront
of
the
morning
or
see
aphrodite
in
the
upper
air
loose
the
long
lustre
of
her
golden
locks
but
you
bring
back
avertant
the
paganism
of
the
days
of
pliny
and
statius
and
juvenal
of
much
philosophy
and
little
belief
of
superb
villas
and
superb
taste
of
banquets
for
the
palate
in
the
shape
of
cookery
and
banquets
for
the
eye
in
the
shape
of
art
of
poetry
singing
dead
songs
on
dead
themes
with
the
most
polished
and
artistic
vocalisation
of
everything
most
polished
from
the
manners
to
the
marble
floors
of
vice
carefully
drained
out
of
sight
and
large
fountains
of
virtue
springing
in
the
open
air
in
one
word
a
most
shining
paganism
indeed
as
putrescence
also
shines
unlike
george
gissing
and
so
many
others
who
had
to
wade
to
celebrity
through
sloughs
of
bitter
destitution
francis
thompson
felt
no
inclination
to
capitalize
his
expert
knowledge
of
back
streets
and
alleys
for
profit
and
the
morbid
entertainment
of
the
curious
his
single
failing
in
yielding
to
the
attraction
of
an
insidious
drug
seemed
to
be
impotent
to
affect
his
high
admirations
and
his
clear
perceptions
in
the
regions
of
honor
and
religion
illustration
yea
faileth
now
even
dream
the
dreamer
it
is
surely
one
of
the
literary
glories
of
a
distinguished
family
that
and
meynell
succeeded
in
helping
thompson
to
emancipate
himself
from
the
enslavement
of
a
tyrannic
habit
his
poetic
genius
began
to
flower
in
the
new
liberty
for
the
next
ten
years
interest
in
his
poetry
and
literary
friends
and
connections
few
and
select
made
his
life
comparatively
happy
but
he
maintained
a
large
measure
of
independence
to
the
last
that
he
was
never
ungrateful
to
those
who
befriended
him
his
poems
are
ample
proof
but
in
london
he
always
had
his
own
lodgings
in
a
cheap
but
respectable
quarter
of
the
city
his
unpunctual
and
preoccupied
manner
sometimes
created
small
distresses
for
his
devoted
friends
to
relieve
during
the
last
ten
years
of
his
life
he
wrote
little
poetry
his
vitality
never
vigorous
was
ebbing
and
unequal
to
the
demands
of
inspired
verse
but
during
these
years
of
decline
he
wrote
much
golden
prose
he
was
a
regular
and
highly
valued
contributor
to
the
the
the
and
the
one
can
hardly
fail
to
be
impressed
by
the
mere
industry
of
a
writer
of
reputed
slack
habits
of
work
the
published
volume
of
his
selected
essays
is
literary
criticism
as
learned
and
allusive
as
matthew
arnold
and
as
nicely
poised
with
the
advantage
of
being
poised
in
more
rarified
heights
than
arnold
wings
could
hope
to
scale
in
this
book
is
his
classic
and
most
wonderful
essay
on
shelley
written
before
his
strength
began
to
flag
in
which
prose
seems
to
be
carried
off
its
feet
as
it
were
in
a
very
storm
of
poetic
impulse
the
published
essays
are
not
a
tithe
of
thompson
writings
for
the
press
moreover
we
have
a
study
of
blessed
john
de
la
salle
a
little
volume
on
health
and
holiness
and
a
large
life
of
ignatius
loyola
none
of
them
suggesting
even
remotely
the
plantigrade
writing
of
the
mechanical
hack
during
the
last
year
of
his
life
when
consumption
had
almost
completely
undermined
resistance
his
old
habit
reasserted
its
empire
but
it
was
not
for
long
and
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
hastened
the
end
which
came
on
november
in
the
hospital
of
john
and
elizabeth
he
was
buried
in
mary
cemetery
kensal
green
and
on
his
coffin
were
roses
from
george
meredith
garden
with
the
message
a
true
poet
one
of
the
small
band
the
hound
of
heaven
has
been
called
the
greatest
ode
in
the
english
language
such
was
the
contemporary
verdict
of
some
of
the
most
respected
critics
of
the
time
and
the
conviction
of
its
justness
deepens
with
the
passing
of
years
recall
the
writers
of
great
odes
milton
dryden
pope
gray
collins
wordsworth
keats
shelley
coleridge
the
best
they
have
done
will
not
outstare
the
hound
of
heaven
where
shall
we
find
its
equal
for
exaltation
of
mood
that
knows
no
fatigue
from
the
first
word
to
the
last
the
motion
of
angelic
hosts
must
be
like
the
movement
of
this
ode
combining
in
some
marvellous
and
mysterious
way
the
swiftness
of
lightning
with
the
stately
progress
of
a
pageant
white
with
the
blinding
white
light
of
an
awful
presence
the
note
of
modernness
is
the
quality
which
is
most
likely
to
mislead
us
in
forecasting
favorably
the
durability
of
contemporary
poetry
appealing
as
it
does
to
so
many
personal
issues
irrelevant
to
the
standards
of
immortal
art
this
is
precisely
the
note
which
is
least
conspicuous
in
the
hound
of
heaven
the
poem
might
have
been
written
in
the
days
of
shakespeare
or
in
a
different
speech
by
dante
or
calderon
the
rev
francis
lebuffe
has
written
an
interesting
book
on
the
hound
of
heaven
pointing
out
the
analogy
between
the
poem
and
the
psalms
of
david
and
another
jesuit
the
late
rev
in
a
published
study
of
the
poem
says
that
in
it
francis
thompson
seems
to
sing
in
verse
the
thought
of
ignatius
in
the
spiritual
exercises
the
thought
of
paul
in
the
tender
insistent
love
of
christ
for
the
soul
and
the
yearning
of
christ
for
that
soul
which
ever
runs
after
creatures
till
the
love
of
christ
wakens
in
it
a
love
of
its
god
which
dims
and
deadens
all
love
of
creatures
except
through
love
for
him
this
was
the
love
of
paul
of
ignatius
of
stanislaus
of
francis
of
assist
of
clare
of
st
teresa
illustration
the
hid
battlements
of
eternity
those
shaken
mists
a
space
unsettle
then
round
the
turrets
slowly
wash
again
the
neologisms
and
archaic
words
employed
in
the
poem
seem
to
be
a
legitimate
and
instinctive
effort
of
the
poet
inspiration
to
soar
above
the
limitations
of
time
and
to
liberate
itself
from
the
transient
accretions
of
a
living
and
therefore
constantly
changing
mode
of
speech
he
strove
after
an
enfranchisement
of
utterance
devoid
of
stratifying
peculiarities
assignable
to
no
age
or
epoch
and
understood
of
all
a
thought
prevalent
throughout
christendom
was
felt
imaginatively
by
a
highly
endowed
poet
and
like
impetuous
volcanic
fires
that
fling
heavenward
mighty
fragments
and
boulders
of
mountain
in
their
red
release
found
magnificent
expression
in
elemental
grandeurs
of
language
shot
through
with
the
wild
lights
of
hidden
flames
and
transcending
all
pettiness
of
calculated
artifice
and
fugitive
fashion
the
dominating
idea
in
the
hound
of
heaven
is
so
familiar
so
one
might
say
innate
that
it
is
almost
impudent
to
undertake
to
explain
it
even
in
the
cases
of
persons
to
whom
the
reading
of
poetry
is
an
uncultivated
and
difficult
art
there
is
an
instantaneous
leap
of
recognition
as
the
thought
emerges
from
the
cloudy
glories
of
the
poem
still
modern
popular
systems
of
philosophy
are
so
dehumanizing
in
their
tendencies
and
so
productive
of
what
may
be
called
secondary
and
artificially
planted
instincts
that
it
is
perhaps
not
entirely
useless
to
attempt
to
elucidate
the
obvious
the
heavens
says
hazlitt
have
gone
farther
off
and
become
astronomical
the
conception
of
the
universe
in
mediaeval
times
when
dying
was
like
going
out
of
one
room
into
another
and
man
entertained
a
neighborly
feeling
for
the
angels
has
a
tendency
to
disappear
as
science
unfolds
more
and
more
new
infinities
of
time
and
space
new
infinities
of
worlds
and
forms
of
life
the
curious
notion
has
crept
in
that
man
must
sink
lower
into
insignificance
with
every
new
discovery
of
the
vastness
and
huge
design
of
creation
god
would
seem
to
have
himself
in
disclosing
his
power
and
majesty
stunning
and
overwhelming
the
intellect
and
heart
with
the
crushing
weight
of
the
evidences
of
his
infinity
we
have
modern
thinkers
regarding
christian
notions
of
the
godhead
as
impossible
to
a
mind
acquainted
with
the
paralyzing
revelations
of
scientific
knowledge
the
late
john
fiske
used
to
deride
what
he
called
the
anthromorphism
of
the
christian
idea
of
god
as
of
a
venerable
man
and
these
philosophers
deem
it
more
reverent
to
deny
any
personal
relationship
between
god
and
man
for
the
reason
that
god
is
too
great
to
be
interested
in
man
and
man
too
little
to
be
an
object
of
interest
before
indicating
the
essential
error
of
this
attitude
it
is
necessary
to
state
merely
for
the
sake
of
historical
accuracy
that
the
christian
conception
of
the
godhead
as
expressed
by
thomas
aquinas
dante
lessius
and
a
host
of
christian
writers
has
never
been
approached
in
its
sublime
suggestions
of
infinite
and
eternal
power
and
glory
by
any
modern
philosopher
in
the
second
and
third
lectures
of
cardinal
newman
scope
and
nature
of
university
education
there
is
an
outline
of
the
christian
teaching
of
the
nature
of
god
which
in
painstaking
accuracy
of
thought
and
sheer
grandeur
of
conception
has
no
counterpart
in
modern
literature
let
us
always
remember
that
telescope
and
microscope
in
all
the
range
of
their
discoveries
have
not
uncovered
the
existence
of
anything
greater
than
man
himself
the
most
massive
star
of
the
milky
way
is
not
so
wonderful
as
the
smallest
human
child
moreover
man
present
entourage
of
illimitable
space
and
countless
circling
suns
and
planets
can
not
be
said
to
have
cost
an
omnipotent
god
more
trouble
so
to
speak
than
a
universe
a
million
times
smaller
the
prodigality
of
the
creator
reveals
his
endless
resources
if
the
vision
of
sidereal
abysses
and
flaming
globes
intimidates
me
and
makes
me
cynical
about
my
unimportance
is
it
not
because
i
have
lost
the
high
consciousness
of
a
spiritual
being
and
forgotten
the
unplumbed
chasms
which
separate
matter
from
mind
illustration
whether
man
heart
or
life
it
be
which
yields
thee
harvest
must
thy
harvest
fields
be
dunged
with
rotten
death
in
francis
thompson
catholic
philosophy
which
must
be
partially
understood
if
the
reader
is
to
get
at
the
heart
of
the
hound
of
heaven
the
tremendous
manifestations
of
god
attributes
of
power
prepare
us
to
expect
equally
tremendous
manifestations
of
his
attributes
of
love
the
more
prodigal
god
is
discovered
to
be
in
lavish
expenditures
of
omnipotence
in
the
material
universe
the
more
alert
the
soul
becomes
to
look
for
and
to
detect
overwhelming
surprises
of
divine
love
hence
to
thompson
there
was
nothing
irrational
in
the
special
revelation
of
god
to
man
in
his
incarnation
his
death
on
the
cross
and
his
sacramental
life
in
the
church
the
divine
energy
of
god
love
as
displayed
in
the
supernatural
revelation
of
himself
seems
to
be
even
vaster
and
more
intense
than
the
divine
energy
of
creation
displayed
in
the
revelation
of
nature
every
new
revelation
of
god
power
and
wisdom
which
science
unfolds
serves
only
to
restore
a
balance
in
our
mind
between
god
power
and
god
love
the
more
astronomical
the
heavens
become
the
closer
they
bring
god
to
us
another
conception
of
god
to
be
kept
in
mind
if
we
are
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
hound
of
heaven
is
the
omniscient
character
the
infinite
perfection
of
god
knowledge
god
sees
each
of
us
as
fully
and
completely
as
if
there
were
no
one
else
and
nothing
else
to
see
except
us
practically
speaking
god
gives
each
one
of
us
his
undivided
attention
and
through
this
spacious
channel
of
his
divine
and
exclusive
attention
pour
the
of
his
love
the
weak
soul
is
afraid
of
the
terrible
excess
of
divine
love
it
tries
to
elude
it
but
love
meets
it
at
every
and
down
which
it
would
run
and
hide
itself
and
gently
turns
it
back
francis
thompson
in
an
interpretation
of
a
narrow
vessel
has
left
us
in
prose
a
description
of
human
weakness
and
wilfulness
reluctant
of
its
true
bliss
the
following
passage
is
an
excellent
commentary
on
the
hound
of
heaven
though
god
he
says
asks
of
the
soul
but
to
love
him
what
it
may
and
is
ready
to
give
an
increased
love
for
a
poor
little
the
soul
feels
that
this
infinite
love
demands
naturally
its
whole
self
that
if
it
begin
to
love
god
it
may
not
stop
short
of
all
it
has
to
yield
it
is
troubled
even
if
it
did
go
a
brief
way
on
the
upward
path
it
fears
and
recoils
from
the
whole
great
surrender
the
constant
effort
beyond
itself
which
is
sensibly
laid
on
it
it
falls
back
with
relieved
contentment
on
some
human
love
a
love
on
its
own
plane
where
somewhat
short
of
total
surrender
may
go
to
requital
where
no
upward
effort
is
needful
and
it
ends
by
giving
for
the
meanest
the
most
unsufficing
and
return
that
utter
and
which
it
denied
to
god
even
how
rarely
if
the
return
be
such
as
mortal
may
render
how
empty
and
unsatiated
it
leaves
the
soul
one
always
is
less
generous
to
love
than
the
other
god
walks
morning
noon
and
eve
in
the
garden
of
the
soul
calling
it
to
a
happiness
which
affrights
it
and
the
timid
and
soul
strives
to
hide
itself
under
the
stars
under
the
clouds
of
heaven
under
human
love
under
the
distractions
of
work
and
pleasure
and
study
offers
itself
as
a
wistful
servitor
to
child
and
man
and
nature
if
they
will
but
afford
it
a
refuge
from
the
persistent
and
gentle
accents
of
pursuivant
love
but
all
things
are
in
league
with
god
who
made
and
rules
them
they
can
not
conspire
against
him
they
betray
the
refugee
he
turns
in
abject
surrender
and
is
astonished
to
find
the
rest
and
happiness
that
he
quested
for
so
wildly
the
divine
thwartings
which
had
harassed
the
soul
become
a
tender
mystery
of
infinite
love
forcing
itself
upon
an
unworthy
and
unwilling
creature
someone
has
said
that
every
life
is
a
romance
of
divine
love
the
hound
of
heaven
is
a
version
of
that
romance
which
smites
the
soul
into
an
humble
mood
of
acknowledgment
and
penitence

francis

born
in

in
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
mature
life
in
london
where
he
died

was
educated
at
ushaw
college
near
durham
and
afterwards
went
to
owens
college
manchester
to
qualify
as
a
doctor

his
gift
as
prescriber
and
healer
lay
elsewhere
than
in
the
he
walked
to
london
in
search
of
a
living
finding
indeed
a
prolonged
near
approach
to
death
in
its
streets
until
at
length
his
literary
powers
were
discovered
by
himself
and
by
others
and
he
began
in
his
later
twenties
an
outpouring
of
verse
which
endured
for
a
of
years
his
poems
his
sister
songs
and
his
new
poems
the
hound
of

marked
the
return
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
thomas

kempis
the
great
poetry
of
it
transcended
in
itself
and
in
its
influence
all
conventions

that
it
won

love
of

included
by
