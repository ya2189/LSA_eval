lived

yesterday
asia
had
no
name
till
man
was
old
and
long
had
learned
the
use
of
iron
and
gold
and
æons
had
passed
when
the
first
corn
was
planted
since
first
the
use
of
syllables
was
granted
men
were
on
earth
while
climates
slowly
swung
fanning
wide
zones
to
heat
and
cold
and
long
subsidence
turned
great
continents
to
sea
and
seas
dried
up
dried
up
interminably
age
after
age
enormous
seas
were
dried
amid
wastes
of
land
and
the
last
monsters
died
earth
wore
another
face
o
since
that
prime
man
with
how
many
works
has
sprinkled
time
hammering
hewing
digging
tunnels
roads
building
ships
temples
multiform
abodes
how
for
his
body
appetites
his
toils
have
conquered
all
earth
products
all
her
soils
and
in
what
thousand
thousand
shapes
of
art
he
has
tried
to
find
a
language
for
his
heart
never
at
rest
never
content
or
tired
insatiate
wanderer
marvellously
fired
most
grandly
piling
and
piling
into
the
air
stones
that
will
topple
or
arch
he
knows
not
where
and
yet
did
i
this
spring
think
it
more
strange
more
grand
more
full
of
awe
than
all
that
change
and
lovely
and
sweet
and
touching
unto
tears
that
through
man
chronicled
and
unchronicled
years
and
even
into
that
unguessable
beyond
the
has
nested
by
a
pond
weaving
dry
flags
into
a
beaten
floor
the
one
sure
product
of
her
only
lore
low
on
a
ledge
above
the
shadowed
water
then
when
she
heard
no
men
as
nature
taught
her
flashing
around
with
busy
scarlet
bill
she
built
that
nest
her
nest
and
builds
it
still
o
let
your
strong
imagination
turn
the
great
wheel
backward
until
troy
unburn
and
then
unbuild
and
seven
troys
below
rise
out
of
death
and
dwindle
and
outflow
till
all
have
passed
and
none
has
yet
been
there
back
ever
back
our
birds
still
crossed
the
air
beyond
our
myriad
changing
generations
still
built
unchanged
their
known
inhabitations
a
million
years
before
atlantis
was
our
lark
sprang
from
some
hollow
in
the
grass
some
old
soft
in
a
tussock
shade
and
the
smooth
eggs
were
laid
high
amid
green
pines
shafts
and
rooks
their
villages
of
twiggy
rafts
set
on
the
tops
of
elms
where
elms
grew
then
and
still
the
thumbling
tit
and
perky
wren
popped
through
the
tiny
doors
of
cosy
balls
and
the
blackbird
lined
with
moss
his
walls
a
round
mud
cottage
held
the
thrush
young
and
straws
from
the
untidy
sparrow
hung
and
skimming
forktailed
in
the
evening
air
when
man
first
was
were
not
the
martins
there
did
not
those
birds
some
human
shelter
crave
and
stow
beneath
the
cornice
of
his
cave
their
dry
tight
cups
of
clay
and
from
each
door
peeped
on
a
morning
wiseheads
three
or
four
yes
daw
and
owl
curlew
and
crested
hern
kingfisher
mallard
and
tern
chaffinch
and
greenfinch
wagtail
stonechat
ruff
whitethroat
and
robin
and
chough
magpie
and
jay
built
those
far
ages
gone
in
this
year
way
and
the
first
man
who
walked
the
cliffs
of
rame
as
i
this
year
looked
down
and
saw
the
same
blotches
of
rusty
red
on
ledge
and
cleft
with
spots
on
them
while
right
and
left
a
dizzying
tangle
of
gulls
were
floating
and
flying
wheeling
and
crossing
and
darting
crying
and
crying
circling
and
crying
over
and
over
and
over
crying
with
swoop
and
hover
and
fall
and
recover
and
below
on
a
rock
against
the
grey
sea
fretted
and
stationary
and
silhouetted
cormorants
stood
in
a
wise
black
equal
row
above
the
nests
and
long
blue
eggs
we
know
o
delicate
chain
over
all
the
ages
stretched
o
dumb
tradition
from
what
far
darkness
fetched
each
little
architect
with
its
one
design
perpetual
fixed
and
right
in
stuff
and
line
each
little
ministrant
who
knows
one
thing
one
learnèd
rite
to
celebrate
the
spring
whatever
alters
else
on
sea
or
shore
these
are
unchanging
man
must
still
explore
a
dog
death
the
loose
earth
falls
in
the
grave
like
a
peaceful
regular
breathing
too
like
for
i
was
deceived
a
moment
by
the
sound
it
has
covered
the
heap
of
bracken
that
the
gardener
laid
above
him
quiet
the
spade
swings
there
we
have
now
his
mound
a
patch
of
fresh
earth
on
the
floor
of
the
wood
renewing
chamber
all
around
is
grass
and
moss
and
the
hyacinth
dark
green
sprouts
and
oaks
are
above
that
were
old
when
his
fiftieth
sire
was
a
puppy
and
far
away
in
the
garden
i
hear
the
children
shouts
their
joy
is
remote
as
a
dream
it
is
strange
how
we
buy
our
sorrow
for
the
touch
of
perishing
things
idly
with
open
eyes
how
we
give
our
hearts
to
brutes
that
will
die
in
a
few
seasons
nor
trouble
what
we
do
when
we
do
it
nor
would
have
it
otherwise
a
poet
to
his
muse
muse
you
have
opened
like
a
flower
long
ago
i
knew
that
brown
integument
like
a
dead
husk
had
dormant
life
within
it
and
waited
till
a
first
white
point
appeared
which
shot
into
a
naked
stiff
pale
spike
that
grew
i
knew
this
was
not
all
nothing
i
said
as
greener
you
grew
and
taller
but
dreamed
alone
of
the
day
when
your
bud
would
unsheathe
and
silently
swell
and
at
last
your
crown
would
break
filling
the
air
with
clouds
of
colour
and
fragrance
radiant
waves
odours
of
immortality
in
a
pot
of
earth
i
watered
and
tended
you
breaking
the
clods
and
soaking
the
earth
with
water
that
fed
your
roots
and
eased
your
way
to
the
light
i
gave
you
the
sun
and
the
rain
but
saved
you
from
scorching
and
drowning
you
are
mine
and
only
i
know
you
and
the
ways
of
your
growth
and
the
days
but
you
are
not
from
me
i
am
but
a
pen
for
a
hand
a
bed
for
a
river
a
window
for
light
and
i
bow
in
awe
to
that
power
that
made
you
a
flower
processes
of
thought
i
i
find
my
mind
as
it
were
a
deep
water
sometimes
i
play
with
a
thought
and
hammer
and
bend
it
till
tired
and
displeased
with
that
i
toss
it
away
or
absently
let
it
slip
to
the
yawning
water
and
down
it
sinks
forgotten
for
many
a
day
but
a
time
comes
when
tide
or
tempest
washes
it
high
on
the
beach
and
i
find
that
shape
of
mine
or
i
haul
it
out
from
the
depths
on
some
casual
rope
or
passing
over
that
spot
in
quiet
shine
i
see
where
my
boat
shadow
makes
deep
the
water
a
patch
of
colour
far
down
from
the
bottom
apart
a
wavering
sign
like
the
gleam
from
an
ancient
anchor
brown
fixing
and
fleeting
flakes
and
i
feel
my
heart
wake
to
a
strange
excitement
so
that
i
stop
put
up
my
paddles
and
dredge
with
a
careful
net
and
i
catch
it
and
see
it
stir
and
feel
its
weight
and
pull
till
it
nears
and
breaks
from
the
water
wet
and
my
eyes
dwell
on
that
old
abandoned
thing
recovered
by
chance
for
the
shape
i
had
found
so
dull
has
crusted
and
changed
in
secrecy
and
silence
and
its
surface
shines
like
a
pearl
most
beautiful
ii
in
bed
i
lie
and
my
thoughts
come
filing
by
all
forms
and
faces
cheerful
serene
and
sad
some
clear
some
mistily
showing
and
fragmentary
some
altered
in
size
or
shape
since
last
they
were
seen
but
o
last
you
group
of
merry
ones
lord
knows
when
i
saw
you
before
but
i
met
you
once
the
whole
collection
of
you
and
now
rosy
and
grinning
with
linked
arms
you
go
swingingly
by
turning
your
faces
to
mine
i
laugh
aloud
you
bad
lots
you
are
a
secret
that
nobody
else
knows
and
you
it
was
that
made
me
break
the
procession
while
memory
gave
me
still
the
power
of
summons
and
call
up
all
i
could
of
a
thoughts
to
parade
them
across
this
proscenium
of
my
skull
in
the
order
they
came
in
more
carefully
recognising
the
old
and
remarking
which
have
developed
or
changed
and
as
for
you
you
rogues
i
am
almost
certain
there
are
one
or
two
more
of
you
now
than
once
there
were
dance
through
the
dark
door
in
to
the
life
that
somewhere
else
you
lead
and
one
day
i
shall
all
unwittingly
call
some
word
you
know
as
a
signal
or
you
see
someone
else
coming
my
way
you
suddenly
follow
and
you
appear
again
quite
possibly
bringing
new
friends
who
are
sure
to
be
just
as
bad
iii
into
the
pits
of
my
heart
and
brain
my
eyes
ears
nose
tongue
fingers
like
five
gardeners
are
shovelling
sights
sounds
odours
savours
contacts
while
i
their
master
casually
nod
and
most
times
stand
idly
by
looking
at
something
else
forgetting
that
the
work
is
going
on
and
only
fully
conscious
of
my
servants
when
something
they
move
is
consonant
with
my
mood
and
draws
my
notice
or
some
other
thing
more
strange
than
usual
or
stronger
in
its
impact
makes
them
exclaim
and
call
to
bid
me
watch
and
then
in
a
ground
of
more
than
our
dimensions
those
quietly
flowing
cascades
of
things
are
hid
they
are
buried
in
those
illimitable
fields
and
ever
as
they
are
swallowed
by
the
earth
the
steady
hours
passing
in
procession
walk
over
them
and
trample
them
well
down
out
of
sight
levelling
all
the
soil
then
some
time
my
returning
feet
uncover
them
my
slaves
are
all
agog
with
recognition
or
else
perhaps
i
come
and
idly
dig
to
see
what
thing
i
can
find
and
out
there
comes
some
old
form
buried
twenty
years
ago
now
called
a
memory
or
marking
well
the
place
where
one
was
put
find
it
and
more
drawn
thither
under
the
ground
tangled
with
others
as
with
roots
into
a
new
festoon
or
one
old
image
wearing
others
like
gems
and
that
creation
airship
over
suburb
a
smooth
blue
sky
with
puffed
motionless
clouds
standing
over
the
plain
of
red
roofs
and
bushy
trees
the
bright
coloured
shell
of
the
large
enamelled
sky
out
of
the
distance
pointing
a
cut
dark
shape
that
moves
this
way
at
leisure
then
hesitates
and
turns
and
its
darkness
suddenly
dies
as
it
turns
and
shows
a
gleaming
silver
white
against
even
the
whitest
cloud
across
the
blue
and
the
low
small
clouds
it
moves
level
with
a
floating
motion
of
its
own
peaceful
sunny
and
slow
a
thing
of
summer
itself
above
the
basking
earth
travelling
the
clouds
and
the
sky
the
invocation
of
lucretius
book
i
mother
of
rome
delight
of
gods
and
men
beloved
venus
who
under
the
fleeting
stars
fillest
the
freighted
sea
and
earth
ripe
fields
o
since
through
thee
alone
all
forms
of
life
are
born
and
climb
into
the
sun
sweet
light
goddess
before
whose
lovely
advancing
feet
the
winds
and
towering
clouds
scatter
and
flee
and
the
labouring
earth
discloses
odorous
flowers
and
the
sea
falls
into
a
shining
calm
and
the
assuaged
heavens
mellow
with
light
for
when
the
face
of
day
awakes
and
the
west
wind
unloosed
flies
procreant
forth
then
first
the
coursing
birds
smitten
at
heart
betray
lady
thy
entrance
and
thy
power
and
then
the
beasts
caper
in
happy
pastures
and
swim
swift
floods
so
all
created
things
captive
to
thee
drawn
by
their
own
desire
stray
through
the
world
thy
presence
leads
through
all
the
seas
and
hills
and
swelling
streams
woods
and
green
luxuriant
plains
thou
harryest
them
with
lust
that
none
shall
fail
to
carry
their
eternal
races
on
since
then
thou
art
sole
queen
of
all
that
is
and
without
thee
to
help
can
nothing
rise
to
cross
the
glorious
frontiers
of
the
light
and
nothing
grow
in
gentleness
or
grace
thee
do
i
pray
to
aid
my
labouring
verse
now
that
of
all
that
is
i
strive
to
sing
lady
for
my
dear
memmian
heir
whom
thou
hast
blest
with
every
constant
excellence
for
his
sake
chiefly
fill
my
words
with
life
an
epilogue
i
the
fluke
for
two
years
you
went
through
all
the
worst
of
it
men
fell
around
you
but
you
did
not
fall
on
the
somme
when
the
air
was
a
sea
of
contesting
flashes
and
clouds
of
smoke
your
gunners
fell
fast
but
you
got
never
a
scratch
and
once
when
you
watched
from
a
village
tower
at
longueval
was
it
between
our
guns
and
theirs
as
men
fought
in
the
houses
below
a
shell
from
an
english
battery
came
and
tore
a
hole
in
the
tower
below
you
but
you
were
not
hurt
and
remained
observing
and
now
a
casual
shell
has
come
and
pierced
your
head
and
the
men
who
were
with
you
uninjured
carried
you
back
and
you
died
on
the
way
ii
the
conversation
when
we
greeted
each
other
again
and
you
filled
your
pipe
and
sat
down
and
stretched
your
legs
you
will
look
in
the
fire
for
a
minute
and
then
you
will
say
with
a
yawn
well
when
do
you
think
this
damned
war
will
be
over
and
i
shall
say
nothing
or
something
as
empty
as
nothing
but
i
am
forgetting
we
shall
not
greet
each
other
again
you
will
not
ask
that
question
again
iii
the
deaf
adder
well
it
no
good
brooding
the
past
can
not
return
they
have
killed
him
and
buried
him
many
men
as
good
as
he
have
gone
they
were
good
men
even
if
one
never
knew
them
it
is
a
just
and
honourable
war
he
went
in
readily
at
the
start
though
he
hated
it
and
one
would
not
have
had
him
do
otherwise
and
thank
god
he
did
the
job
well
that
had
to
be
done
he
has
suffered
with
millions
of
others
for
the
sake
of
the
future
peace
and
ungrudgingly
laid
down
his
life
in
the
cleanest
of
england
wars
there
is
no
room
for
regret
here
only
for
pride
you
fool
lie
down
can
not
you
hear
my
excellent
reasoning
iv
the
landscape
you
said
that
first
winter
that
the
landscape
around
ypres
reminded
you
of
chinese
paintings
the
green
plain
striped
with
trenches
the
few
trees
on
the
plain
and
the
puffs
of
smoke
sprinkled
over
the
plain
you
said
when
the
war
was
over
that
you
would
record
that
green
desolation
in
flat
colours
and
lines
as
a
chinese
artist
would
that
is
what
you
were
going
to
do
the
plain
is
still
there
another
hour
how
many
days
we
spent
together
thousands
and
now
i
would
give
anything
anything
for
another
or
even
for
one
hour
an
hour
were
it
only
of
aimless
lounging
or
a
game
of
billiards
in
a
pub
an
impression
received
from
a
symphony
there
was
a
day
when
i
if
that
was
i
surrendered
lay
beneath
a
burning
sky
where
overhead
the
azure
ached
with
heat
and
many
red
fierce
poppies
splashed
the
wheat
motion
was
dead
and
silence
was
complete
and
stains
of
red
fierce
poppies
splashed
the
wheat
and
as
i
lay
upon
a
bank
i
fell
away
slipped
back
from
earth
and
sank
i
lost
the
place
of
sky
and
field
and
tree
one
covering
face
obscured
the
world
for
me
and
for
an
hour
i
knew
eternity
for
one
fixed
face
suspended
time
for
me
o
had
those
eyes
in
that
extreme
of
bliss
shed
one
more
wise
and
culminating
kiss
my
end
had
come
nor
had
i
lived
to
quail
frightened
and
dumb
as
things
must
do
that
fail
and
in
this
last
black
gale
battered
and
dumb
to
fight
the
dark
and
fail
fen
landscape
wind

the

by
the

grey

the
leaden
water
ducks
fly
low
across
the

three
flying
one
quacks
sadly
grey
are
the
sky
and
the
water
green
the
lost
ribbons
of
small
in
the
silence
a
black
boat
floats
upon
wide
pale
mirrors
meditation
in
lamplight
what
deaths
men
have
died
not
fighting
but
impotent
hung
on
the
wire
between
trenches
burning
and
freezing
groaning
for
water
with
armies
of
men
so
near
the
fall
over
cliff
the
clutch
at
the
rootless

the

rushing
up
the
whirling

stiff
writhings
of

crushing

to
the

the
stink
of

breath
swimming
a
white
belly
a
crescent
of

agony
and
a
spirting
shredded
limb
and
crimson
blood
staining
the
green
water
and
horror
of
horrors
the
slow
grind
on
the
rack
the
breaking
bones
the
stretching
and
bursting
skin
perpetual
fainting
and
waking
to
see
above
the
mocking
faces
of
cruel
men
with
the
power
of
mercy
who
gloat
upon
shrieks
for
mercy
o
pity
me
god
o

make
tolerable
make
tolerable
the
end
that
awaits
for
me
and
give
me
courage
to
die
when
the
time
comes
when
the
time
comes
as
it
must
however
it
comes
that
i
shrink
not
nor
scream
gripped
by
the
jaws
of
the
vice
for
the
thought
of
it
turns
me
sick
and
my
heart
stands
still
knocks
and
stands
still
o
fearful
fearful
shadow
kill
me
let
me
die
to
escape
the
terror
of
thee

no

am
perfectly
well

harlequin
moonlit
woodland
veils
of
green
caves
of
empty
dark
between
veils
of
green
from
rounded
arms
drooping
that
the
moonlight
charms
tranced
the
trees
grass
beneath
silent
like
a
stealthy
breath
mask
and
wand
and
silver

sudden
enters

watch
him

slender

that

flow
curving
wand
above
below
flying
gliding
changing

onset
fading
in
retreat
not
a
shadow
of
sound
there
is
but
his
motion
gentle
hiss
till
one
fluent
arm
and
hand
suddenly
circles
and
the
wand
taps
a
bough
far
overhead
crack
and
then
all
noise
is
dead
for
he
halts
and
a
space
stands
erect
with
upward
face
taut
and
tense
to
the
white
message
of
the
moon
light
what
is
he
thinking
of
you
ask
caught
you
the

behind
the
mask
whence
did
he

but
the
resuming
flow
of
that
swift
continuous
glide
whispering
from
side
to
side
silvered
boughs
branches
dim
all
the
world
a
frame
for
him
all
the
trees
standing
around
on
the
fascinated
ground
see
him
swifter
swifter
sweep
dazzling
till
one
wildest
leap
whisht
he
kneels
and
he
listens
how
his
steady
silver
glistens
he
was
listening
he
was
there
flash
he
went
to
the
air
he
a
waiting
ear
had
bent
silent
but
before
he
went
something
somewhere
else
to
seek
he
moved
his
lips
as
though
to
speak
and
we
wait
and
in
vain
for
he
will
not
come
again
earth
grass
wood
and
air
as
we
stare
and
we
stare
which
that
fierce
life
did
hold
tired
dim
void
cold
winter
nightfall
the
old
yellow
stucco
of
the
time
of
the
regent
is
flaking
and
peeling
the
rows
of
square
windows
in
the
straight
yellow
building
are
empty
and
still
and
the
dusty
dark
evergreens
guarding
the
wicket
are
draped
with
wet
cobwebs
and
above
this
poor
wilderness
toneless
and
sombre
is
the
flat
of
the
hill
they
said
that
a
colonel
who
long
ago
died
here
was
the
last
one
to
live
here
an
old
retired
colonel
some
fraser
or
murray
i
do
know
his
name
death
came
here
and
summoned
him
and
the
shells
of
him
vanished
beyond
all
speculation
and
silence
resumed
here
silence
and
emptiness
and
nobody
came
was
it
wet
when
he
lived
here
were
the
skies
dun
and
hurrying
was
the
rain
so
irresolute
did
he
watch
the
night
coming
did
he
shiver
at
nightfall
before
he
was
dead
did
the
wind
go
so
creepily
chilly
and
puffing
with
drops
of
cold
rain
in
it
was
the
hill
lifted
shoulder
so
lowering
and
menacing
so
dark
and
so
dread
did
he
turn
through
his
doorway
and
go
to
his
study
and
light
many
candles
and
fold
in
the
shutters
and
heap
up
the
fireplace
to
fight
off
the
damps
and
muse
on
his
boyhood
and
wonder
if
india
ever
was
real
and
shut
out
the
loneliness
with
memoirs
and
collections
of
stamps
perhaps
but
he
gone
now
he
and
his
furniture
dispersed
now
for
ever
and
the
last
of
his
trophies
antlers
and
photographs
heaven
knows
where
and
there
grass
in
his
gateway
grass
on
his
footpath
grass
on
his
the
garden
grown
over
the
is
broken
the
windows
are
bare
and
i
leave
him
behind
me
for
the
straggling
discoloured
rags
of
the
daylight
and
hills
and
stone
walls
and
a
rick
long
forgotten
of
blackening
hay
the
road
pale
and
sticky
and
and
nail
marks
and
puddles
and
the
slop
of
my
footsteps
in
this
desolate
cadaverous
clay
a
far
place
sheltered
when
the
rain
blew
over
the
hills
it
was
sunny
all
day
when
the
days
of
summer
were
long
beyond
all
rumour
of
labouring
towns
it
was
but
at
dawn
and
evening
its
trees
were
noisy
with
song
there
were
four
elms
on
the
southward
lawn
standing
their
great
trunks
evenly
set
in
a
square
of
shadowed
grass
in
spring
pierced
with
crocuses
and
their
tops
met
high
in
the
empty
air
where
the
morning
rose
the
grey
church
was
below
us
if
we
stood
by
the
porch
we
saw
on
either
hand
the
ground
falling
the
trees
falling
and
meadows
a
river
hamlets
and
spires
a
chequered
land
a
wide
country
where
cloud
shadows
went
chasing
mile
after
mile
diminishing
fast
until
they
met
the
far
blue
downs
but
round
the
corner
the
western
garden
lay
lonely
under
the
hill
and
closed
in
the
western
garden
under
the
hillside
where
silence
was
and
the
rest
of
the
world
was
gone
we
saw
and
took
the
curving
year
munificence
changing
from
flower
to
flower
the
garden
shone
early
its
walks
were
fringed
with
little
sprays
and
tufts
of
blossom
white
yellow
and
blue
and
all
about
were
sprinkled
stars
of
narcissus
and
swathes
of
tulips
all
over
the
garden
grew
white
groups
and
pink
red
crimson
and
and
the
tulips
once
loved
by
a
boy
red
and
yellow
their
stiff
and
varnished
petals
and
the
scent
of
them
stings
me
still
with
a
youthful
joy
and
in
the
season
of
perfect
and
frailest
beauty
broke
and
the
lilacs
waxen
cones
and
a
tranced
laburnum
trailing
its
veils
of
yellow
tenderly
drooped
over
the
ivied
stones
the
lilacs
browned
a
breath
dried
the
laburnum
the
swollen
peonies
scattered
the
earth
with
blood
and
the
rhododendrons
shed
their
sumptuous
mantles
and
the
marshalled
irises
unsceptred
stood
and
the
borders
filled
with
daisies
and
pied
and
busy
pansies
and
there
as
we
gazed
and
dreamed
and
breathed
the
swooning
smell
of
the
packed
carnations
the
present
was
always
the
crown
of
all
it
seemed
each
month
more
beautiful
sprang
from
a
robe
discarded
the
year
all
effortless
dropt
the
best
away
and
struck
the
heart
with
loveliness
new
more
lavish
when
the
clambering
rose
had
blown
and
died
by
day
the
tapering
hollyhocks
stood
like
pillars
and
shone
to
the
august
sun
the
glimmering
cups
of
waking
evening
primroses
filled
the
dusk
now
the
scent
of
the
rose
was
done
a
wall
there
was
and
a
door
to
the
and
out
of
that
a
gate
to
the
orchard
led
and
there
was
the
last
hedge
and
the
turf
sloped
upward
till
the
sky
was
cut
by
the
hill
line
overhead
and
thither
at
times
we
climbed
and
far
below
us
that
world
that
had
made
the
world
remote
was
seen
small
a
huddle
of
russet
roofs
and
chimneys
and
its
guard
of
elms
like
bushes
against
the
green
one
spot
in
the
country
little
and
mild
and
homely
the
nearest
house
of
a
wide
populous
plain
but
down
at
evening
under
the
stars
and
the
branches
in
the
whispering
garden
we
lost
the
world
again
whispering
faint
the
garden
under
the
hillside
under
the
stars
is
it
true
that
we
lived
there
long
was
it
certainly
so
did
ever
we
know
that
dwelling
breathe
that
night
and
hear
in
the
night
that
song
late
snow
the
heavy
train
through
the
dim
country
went
rolling
rolling
interminably
passing
misty
ridges
that
merged
in
the
snowy
sky
came
turning
meadows
fences
came
gullies
and
passed
and
streams
under
frozen
bridges
across
the
travelling
landscape
evenly
drooped
and
lifted
the
telegraph
wires
thick
ropes
of
snow
in
the
windless
air
they
drooped
and
paused
and
lifted
again
to
unseen
summits
drawing
the
eyes
and
soothing
them
often
to
a
drowsy
stare
singly
in
the
snow
the
ghosts
of
trees
were
softly
pencilled
fainter
and
fainter
in
distance
fading
into
nothingness
gliding
but
sometimes
a
crowd
of
the
intricate
silver
trees
of
fairyland
passed
close
and
intensely
clear
the
phantom
world
hiding
o
untroubled
these
moving
mantled
miles
of
shadowless
shadows
and
lovely
the
film
of
falling
flakes
so
wayward
and
slack
but
i
thought
of
many
a
screening
her
nestlings
sitting
silent
with
wide
bright
eyes
snow
on
her
back
song
you
are
my
sky
beneath
your
circling
kindness
my
meadows
all
take
in
the
light
and
grow
laugh
with
the
joy
you
given
the
joy
you
given
and
open
in
a
thousand
buds
and
blow
but
when
you
are
sombre
sad
averse
forgetful
heavily
veiled
by
clouds
that
brood
with
rain
dumbly
i
lie
all
shadowed
i
lie
all
shadowed
and
dumbly
wait
for
you
to
shine
again
song
the
heaven
is
full
of
the
moon
light
the
earth
fades
below
in
this
vast
empty
world
of
night
i
only
know
trees
and
moonlit
fields
the
bird
tune
and
my
heart
that
yields
her
fragrance
to
the
moon
old
song
my
window
is
darkness
the
sighs
of
the
night
die
in
silence
the
lamp
on
my
table
burns
gravely
the
walls
are
withdrawn
and
beneath
in
your
darkness
you
are
sleeping
and
dreaming
forgetful
but
i
think
of
you
smiling
for
i
wakeful
and
now
it
is
only
an
hour
to
the
dawn
when
the
first
throb
of
light
comes
i
shall
rise
and
go
out
to
the
garden
and
walk
the
lawn
verdure
before
the
wet
gossamer
goes
and
when
you
come
down
sweet
all
singing
and
light
in
the
morning
delight
will
break
ambush
with
your
garden
most
fragrant
and
softest
and
reddest
red
rose
epitaph
in
old
mode
the
leaves
fall
gently
on
the
grass
and
all
the
willow
trees
and
poplar
trees
and
elder
trees
that
bend
above
her
where
she
sleeps
o
all
the
willow
trees
the
willow
trees
breathe
sighs
upon
her
tomb
o
pause
and
pity
as
you
pass
she
loved
so
tenderly
so
quietly
so
hopelessly
and
sometimes
comes
one
here
and
weeps
she
loved
so
tenderly
so
tenderly
and
never
told
them
whom
the
moon
maurice
i
waited
for
a
miracle
dim
was
the
earth
beneath
a
sky
her
boughs
were
vague
in
that
phantasmal
light
her
current
rippled
past
invisibly
no
stir
was
in
the
dark
and
windless
meadows
only
the
water
whispering
in
the
shadows
that
darkened
nature
lived
did
still
proclaim
an
hour
i
stood
in
that
defeat
of
sight
waiting
and
then
a
sudden
silver
flame
burned
in
the
eastern
heaven
and
she
came
the
moon
the
summer
moon
surveys
the
vale
the
boughs
against
the
dawning
sky
grow
black
the
shades
that
hid
those
whispering
waters
fail
and
now
there
falls
a
gleaming
lengthening
track
that
lies
across
the
wide
and
tranquil
river
burnished
and
flat
not
shaken
by
a
quiver
she
rises
still
the
liquid
light
she
spills
makes
everywhere
quick
sparkles
patches
pale
and
as
she
goes
i
know
her
glory
fills
the
air
of
all
our
english
lakes
and
hills
high
over
all
this
england
will
she
ride
she
silvers
all
the
roofs
of
folded
towns
her
brilliance
tips
the
edge
of
every
tide
her
shadows
make
soft
caverns
in
the
downs
even
now
beyond
my
tree
serenely
sailing
she
clothes
far
forests
with
a
gauzy
veiling
and
even
as
here
where
now
i
stare
and
dream
standing
my
own
transfigured
banks
beside
on
many
a
quiet
wandering
english
stream
there
lies
the
unshifting
image
of
her
beam
yes
calm
she
mounts
and
watching
her
i
know
by
many
a
river
other
eyes
than
mine
turn
up
to
her
and
as
of
old
they
show
their
inward
hearts
all
naked
to
her
shine
maids
solitaries
sick
and
happy
lovers
to
whom
her
dear
returning
orb
discovers
for
each
the
gift
he
waits
for
soft
release
the
unsealing
of
imagination
flow
her
own
sweet
pain
or
other
pain
surcease
the
friendly
benediction
of
her
peace
i
too
am
held
as
kind
she
is
as
fair
as
when
long
since
a
younger
heart
drank
deep
from
that
sweet
solace
while
through
summer
air
her
lucid
fingers
hushed
the
world
to
sleep
o
as
i
stand
this
latest
moon
beholding
her
forms
unresting
memory
is
moulding
beneath
my
enchanted
eyelids
there
arise
visions
again
of
many
moons
that
were
fair
fleeting
moons
gathered
from
faded
skies
greeted
and
lost
by
these
corporeal
eyes
unnumbered
are
those
moons
of
memory
stored
in
the
backward
chambers
of
my
brain
the
moons
that
make
bright
pathways
on
the
sea
the
golden
harvest
moon
above
the
grain
the
moon
that
all
a
sleeping
village
blanches
the
woodland
moon
that
roves
beyond
the
branches
filtering
through
the
meshes
of
the
green
to
breast
of
bird
and
mossy
trunk
of
tree
moons
dimly
through
a
cloudy
screen
the
bronze
diffusion
shed
by
moons
unseen
moons
that
a
thin
prismatic
halo
rings
looking
a
hurrying
fleecy
heaven
through
the
fairy
moons
of
luminous
evenings
phantoms
of
palest
pink
in
palest
blue
large
orange
moons
on
earth
grey
verge
suspended
when
trees
still
slumber
from
the
heat
that
ended
erect
and
heavy
and
all
waters
lie
oily
and
there
is
not
a
bird
that
sings
all
these
i
know
i
have
seen
them
born
and
die
and
many
another
moon
in
many
a
sky
there
was
a
moon
that
shone
above
the
ground
where
on
a
grassy
forest
height
i
stood
bright
was
that
open
place
and
all
around
the
dense
discovered
of
the
wood
line
after
line
in
misty
radiance
glistened
failing
away
i
watched
the
scene
and
listened
then
awed
and
hushed
i
turned
and
saw
alone
protruding
from
the
middle
of
the
mound
fringed
with
close
grass
a
moonlit
mottled
stone
of
antiquity
unknown
a
night
there
was
a
crowd
a
narrow
street
torches
that
reddened
faces
drunk
with
dreams
an
orator
exultant
in
defeat
banners
fierce
songs
rough
cheering
women
screams
my
heart
was
one
with
those
rebellious
people
until
along
a
chapel
pointing
steeple
my
eyes
unwitting
wandered
to
a
thin
crescent
and
clouds
a
swift
and
ragged
sheet
and
in
my
spirit
life
all
human
din
died
and
eternal
silence
stood
within
and
once
on
a
far
evening
warm
and
still
i
leant
upon
a
cool
stone
parapet
the
quays
and
houses
underneath
the
hill
twinkled
with
lights
i
heard
the
sea
faint
fret
and
then
above
the
eastern
cape
long
billow
silent
there
welled
a
trembling
line
of
yellow
a
shred
that
quickened
then
a
half
that
grew
to
a
full
moon
that
moved
with
even
will
the
night
was
long
before
her
well
she
knew
and
as
she
slowly
rose
into
the
blue
she
slowly
paled
and
glittering
far
away
flung
on
the
silken
waters
like
a
spear
her
crispèd
silver
shaft
of
moonlight
lay
the
lighthouse
lamp
upon
the
little
pier
burned
wanly
by
that
radiance
clear
and
certain
waiting
i
knew
not
what
uplifted
curtain
i
watched
the
unmoving
world
beneath
my
feet
till
without
warning
miles
across
the
bay
into
that
silver
out
of
shadows
beat
dead
black
the
whole
mysterious
these
moons
i
have
seen
but
these
and
every
one
came
each
so
new
it
seemed
to
be
the
first
new
as
the
buds
that
open
to
the
sun
new
as
the
songs
that
to
the
morning
burst
the
roses
die
each
day
fresh
flowers
are
springing
last
year
it
was
another
blackbird
singing
thou
only
marvellous
blossom
whose
pale
flower
beyond
mankind
conjecture
hath
begun
for
ever
an
unwithering
power
that
stales
the
loveliest
stranger
of
an
hour
but
o
had
all
my
infant
nights
been
dark
or
almost
dark
lit
by
the
stars
alone
had
never
a
teller
of
stories
bid
me
hark
the
promised
splendours
of
that
moon
unknown
how
perfect
then
had
been
the
revelation
when
first
her
gradual
gold
illumination
broke
on
a
night
upon
the
conscious
child
my
heart
had
stopped
with
beauty
seeing
her
arc
climbing
the
heavens
so
far
and
undefiled
so
large
with
light
so
even
and
so
mild
most
wondrous
light
who
this
lovelier
earth
this
world
of
shadows
cool
with
silver
fires
drawing
us
higher
than
our
human
birth
to
whom
our
strange
kind
suspires
its
saddest
thoughts
and
tenderest
and
most
fragrant
tears
and
desires
unnameable
and
vagrant
watcher
who
leanest
quietly
from
above
saying
all
mortal
wars
are
nothing
worth
friend
of
the
sorrowful
tranquil
as
the
dove
muse
of
all
poets
lamp
of
all
who
love
alone
and
sad
alone
and
kind
and
sweet
but
always
peaceful
and
removed
and
proud
whether
with
loveliness
revealed
complete
or
veiling
from
our
vision
in
a
cloud
our
souls
eternal
listener
could
we
wonder
that
men
who
made
of
sun
and
storm
and
thunder
the
awful
forms
of
strong
divinity
heard
in
each
storm
the
noise
of
travelling
feet
should
gazing
at
thy
face
with
hearts
made
free
have
felt
a
pure
immortal
power
in
thee
selene
cynthia
and
artemis
the
swift
proud
goddess
with
the
silver
bow
diana
she
whose
kiss
one
only
knew
though
all
men
yearned
to
know
the
shepherd
on
a
hill
his
flock
was
keeping
the
night
pale
huntress
came
and
found
him
sleeping
she
stooped
he
woke
and
saw
her
hair
that
shone
and
lay
drawn
up
to
cool
and
timeless
bliss
lapt
in
her
radiant
arms
endymion
all
the
still
night
until
the
night
was
gone
by
many
names
they
knew
thee
but
thy
shape
was
woman
always
transient
and
white
a
flashing
huntress
leaving
hinds
agape
a
sweet
descent
of
beauty
in
the
night
yet
some
more
fierce
and
more
distraught
their
dreaming
brooded
until
they
fashioned
from
thy
seeming
a
lithe
and
luring
queen
with
fatal
breath
a
witch
the
man
who
saw
might
not
escape
a
snare
that
gleamed
in
shadowy
groves
of
death
the
tall
tiaraed
syrian
ashtoreth
and
even
in
african
forests
some
there
are
possessed
by
such
a
blasphemy
through
branching
beams
thy
fevered
votaries
come
to
appease
their
brains
distorted
mask
of
thee
there
in
the
glades
the
drums
pulsate
and
languish
men
leap
and
wail
to
dim
the
victim
anguish
in
the
sad
frenzy
of
the
sacrifice
they
are
slaves
to
thee
made
mad
because
thou
art
dumb
and
dumb
thou
lookest
on
them
from
the
skies
above
their
fires
and
dances
blood
and
cries
so
these
but
otherwhere
at
such
an
hour
in
all
the
continents
by
all
the
seas
men
naming
not
the
goddess
feel
thy
power
adoring
her
with
gentler
rites
than
these
the
thoughts
of
myriad
hearts
to
thee
uplifted
rise
like
a
smoke
above
thine
altars
drifted
perpetual
incense
poured
before
thy
throne
by
those
whom
thou
hast
given
thy
secret
dower
those
in
whose
kindred
eyes
thy
light
is
known
whom
thou
hast
signed
and
sealed
for
thine
own
for
thee
they
watch
by
asian
peaks
remote
where
thy
snows
gleam
above
the
pointing
pines
entranced
on
templed
lakes
is
many
a
boat
for
thee
where
clear
thy
dropt
reflection
shines
on
the
great
seas
where
nothing
else
is
tender
rising
and
setting
unto
thee
surrender
all
lonely
hearts
in
lonely
wandering
ships
and
where
their
warm
islands
float
through
forests
many
a
maiden
slips
to
gaze
on
thee
with
parted
burning
lips
o
thus
they
do
and
thus
they
did
of
old
our
hearts
were
never
secret
in
thy
sight
ere
our
first
records
were
thy
shrine
was
cold
that
speechless
eyes
went
seeking
in
the
night
beyond
the
compass
of
our
dim
traditions
thou
knewest
of
men
the
pitiful
ambitions
their
loves
and
their
despair
within
thy
ken
all
our
poor
history
has
been
unrolled
thou
hast
seen
all
races
born
and
die
again
the
climbing
and
the
crumbling
towers
of
men
black
were
the
hollows
of
that
emperor
eyes
who
paced
with
backward
arms
beyond
his
tents
lone
in
the
night
and
felt
above
him
rise
the
ancient
conqueror
sloping
smooth
immense
pyramid
enduring
courses
heard
not
his
sentries
nor
his
stamping
horses
but
thought
of
egypt
dead
upon
that
air
fighting
with
his
memories
of
vanished
kings
who
builded
and
the
bare
sands
in
the
moon
before
those
builders
were
restless
he
knew
that
moon
who
watched
him
muse
had
seen
a
restless
cæsar
brood
on
fame
amid
the
pharaohs
broken
avenues
and
circling
round
that
fixed
monition
came
woven
by
moonlight
random
transitory
fragments
of
all
the
dim
receding
story
the
moonlit
water
dripping
from
the
oars
of
triremes
in
the
bay
of
syracuse
the
opposing
bivouacs
upon
the
shores
that
knew
dead
hector
and
achilles
wars
he
saw
carthage
alexander
grave
the
tomb
of
moses
in
the
wilderness
the
moonlight
on
the
atlantean
wave
that
covered
all
a
multitude
distress
cities
and
hosts
and
emperors
departed
under
the
steady
moon
and
he
turned
away
and
in
a
little
died
even
as
he
who
hunted
from
his
cave
and
struck
his
foe
and
stripped
the
shaggy
hide
under
the
moon
and
was
not
satisfied
for
in
the
prime
thy
influence
was
felt
when
eyes
first
saw
thy
beauty
was
as
this
thy
quiet
look
bade
hope
fear
passion
melt
before
men
dreamed
of
empire
the
abyss
of
thought
yawned
through
their
jungle
then
as
ever
dark
past
dark
future
menaced
their
endeavour
yet
on
thy
nights
stood
some
by
hill
and
sea
naked
and
blind
impulsive
spirits
knelt
not
questioning
why
they
knelt
feeling
in
thee
thought
strangest
sweetest
saddest
mystery
still
moon
bright
moon
compassionate
moon
above
thou
shinedst
there
ere
any
life
began
when
of
his
pain
or
of
his
powerless
love
thou
heardest
not
from
heart
of
any
man
though
long
the
earth
had
shaken
off
the
vapour
left
by
the
vanished
gleams
of
fire
the
shaper
old
old
her
stony
wrinkled
face
did
grow
whilst
only
her
blind
elements
did
move
dumb
bare
and
prayerless
thou
her
go
and
afterwards
again
shalt
see
her
so
a
time
there
was
when
life
had
never
been
a
time
will
be
it
will
have
passed
away
still
wilt
thou
shine
still
tender
and
serene
when
life
which
in
thy
sister
yesterday
had
never
flowered
will
have
drooped
and
faded
passed
with
the
clouds
that
once
her
bosom
shaded
she
will
be
barren
then
as
not
before
bared
of
her
snows
and
all
her
garments
green
no
darkling
sea
by
any
earthly
shore
will
take
thy
rays
thy
kin
will
be
no
more
pale
satellite
old
mistress
of
our
fires
who
hast
seen
so
much
and
been
so
much
to
men
symbol
and
goal
of
all
our
wild
desires
not
any
voice
will
cry
upon
thee
then
dreamer
and
dream
they
will
have
all
gone
over
the
sick
of
heart
the
singer
and
the
lover
an
end
there
will
have
been
to
all
their
lust
their
sorrow
and
the
sighing
of
their
lyres
o
all
this
life
that
stained
earth
patient
crust
time
dying
breath
will
have
blown
away
like
dust
gone
from
thine
eye
that
brief
confusèd
stir
the
rumours
and
the
marching
and
the
strife
earth
will
be
still
and
all
the
face
of
her
swept
of
the
last
remains
of
moving
life
the
last
of
all
men
monuments
that
defied
them
like
those
his
valiant
gestures
that
denied
them
into
the
waiting
elements
will
fade
and
thou
wilt
see
thy
fellow
traveller
a
forlorn
round
of
rocky
contours
made
a
glimmering
disk
of
empty
light
and
shade
ah
depth
too
deep
for
thought
therein
to
cast
the
old
the
cold
companions
you
will
go
obeying
still
some
past
and
all
our
pitiful
history
none
will
know
still
shining
moon
still
peaceful
wilt
thou
wander
but
on
that
greater
ball
no
heart
will
ponder
the
thought
that
rose
and
nightingale
are
gone
and
all
sweet
things
but
thou
and
only
vast
ridges
of
rock
remain
and
stars
and
sun
o
moon
thou
wilt
be
lovely
alone
for
none
and
so
pale
wanderer
so
thou
leavest
me
passing
beyond
imagination
range
away
into
the
void
where
waits
for
thee
thy
inconceivable
destiny
of
change
and
after
all
the
memories
i
have
striven
to
paint
this
picture
that
thyself
hast
given
lives
and
i
watch
to
all
those
others
blind
thy
form
gliding
into
eternity
fading
an
unconjectured
fate
to
find
the
last
most
wonderful
image
of
the
mind
the
happy
night
i
have
loved
from
love
last
bordering
steep
i
have
fallen
at
last
with
joy
and
forgotten
the
shore
i
have
known
my
love
as
never
before
i
have
flung
myself
in
the
deep
and
drawn
from
the
deep
and
kissed
her
lightly
and
left
my
beloved
to
sleep
and
now
i
sit
in
the
night
and
my
heart
is
still
strong
and
secure
there
is
nothing
that
left
to
will
there
is
nothing
to
win
but
only
a
thing
to
keep
and
i
look
completed
and
not
afraid
into
the
windy
dark
where
shines
no
light
and
care
not
at
all
though
the
darkness
never
should
fade
nor
fear
that
death
should
suddenly
come
knowing
my
last
would
be
surely
my
bravest
breath
i
am
happy
i
have
laughed
at
death
constantinople
suddenly
realise
that
the
ambition
of
my
life

your

but
the
dark
men
who
walk
therein
know
not

they
fell
long
since
upon
your
stones
and
made
your
colours
dim
their
priests
who
pray
on
christmas
day
they
sing
no
christmas
hymn
but
a
voice
at
evening
goes
from
every
climbing
tower
crying
a
word
you
never
heard
a
name
of
desert
power
constantine

for
seven
hundred
years
we
gripped
a
weakening
blade
keeping
the
gateway

with
none
to

us
aid
till
at
the
last
they
broke
what
constantine
had
built
and
by
the
shattered
wall
the
blood
of
constantine
was
spilt
do
men
remember
still
the
manner
of
my
death
how
after

at

last
kept

on

bloody
brood
till
those
must
turn
to
save
themselves
who
had
known
not
gratitude
one
fought
them
on
the
middle

one
at
vienna

and
then
the
kings

watched
the
red

abate
till
in

end
byzantium
heard
a
returning

but
still
a
mehmet
holds
your
tomb
keep
silence
ask
no
more
elegy
i
vaguely
wondered
what
you
were
about
but
never
wrote
when
you
had
gone
away
assumed
you
better
quenched
the
uneasy
doubt
you
might
need
faces
or
have
things
to
say
did
i
think
of
you
last
evening
dead
you
lay
o
bitter
words
of
conscience
i
hold
the
simple
message
and
fierce
with
grief
the
awakened
heart
cries
out
it
shall
not
be
it
is
still
yesterday
there
is
time
yet
sorrow
would
strive
backward
to
wrench
the
sun
but
the
sun
moves
our
onward
course
is
set
the
wake
streams
out
the
engine
pulses
run
droning
a
lonelier
voyage
is
begun
it
is
all
too
late
for
turning
you
are
past
all
mortal
signal
there
will
be
time
for
nothing
but
regret
and
the
memory
of
things
done
the
quiet
voice
that
always
counselled
best
the
mind
that
so
ironically
played
yet
for
mere
gentleness
forbore
the
jest
the
proud
and
tender
heart
that
sat
in
shade
nor
once
solicited
another
aid
yet
was
so
grateful
always
for
trifles
lightly
given
the
silences
the
melancholy
guessed
sometimes
when
your
eyes
strayed
but
always
when
you
turned
you
talked
the
more
through
all
our
literature
your
way
you
took
with
modest
ease
yet
would
you
soonest
pore
smiling
with
most
affection
in
your
look
on
the
ripe
ancient
and
the
curious
nook
sage
travellers
learned
printers
divines
and
buried
poets
you
knew
them
all
but
never
half
your
lore
was
drawn
from
any
book
stories
and
jests
from
field
and
town
and
port
and
odd
neglected
scraps
of
history
from
everywhere
for
you
were
of
the
sort
cool
and
refined
who
like
rough
company
carter
and
barmaid
hawker
and
bargee
wise
pensioners
and
boxers
with
whom
you
drank
and
listened
to
legends
of
old
revelry
and
sport
and
customs
of
the
sea
i
hear
you
yet
more
clear
than
all
one
note
one
sudden
hail
i
still
remember
best
that
came
on
sunny
days
from
one
afloat
and
drew
me
to
the
pane
in
certain
quest
of
a
long
brown
face
bare
arms
and
flimsy
vest
in
fragments
through
the
branches
above
the
green
reflections
paused
by
the
willows
in
your
varnished
boat
you
with
your
oars
at
rest
did
that
come
back
to
you
when
you
were
dying
i
think
it
did
you
had
much
leisure
there
and
with
the
things
we
knew
came
quietly
flying
memories
of
things
you
had
seen
we
knew
not
where
you
watched
again
with
meditative
stare
places
where
you
had
wandered
golden
and
calm
in
distance
voices
from
all
your
altering
past
came
sighing
on
the
soft
hampshire
air
for
there
you
sat
a
hundred
miles
away
a
rug
upon
your
knees
your
hands
gone
frail
and
daily
bade
your
farewell
to
the
day
a
music
blent
of
trees
and
clouds
asail
and
figures
in
some
old
neglected
tale
and
watched
the
sunset
gathering
and
heard
the
birdsong
fading
and
went
within
when
the
last
sleepy
lay
passed
to
a
farther
vale
never
complaining
and
stepped
up
to
bed
more
and
more
slow
a
tall
and
sunburnt
man
grown
bony
and
bearded
knowing
you
would
be
dead
before
the
summer
glad
your
life
began
even
thus
to
end
after
so
short
a
span
and
mused
a
space
serenely
then
fell
to
easy
slumber
at
peace
content
for
never
again
your
head
need
make
another
plan
most
generous
most
gentle
most
discreet
who
left
us
ignorant
to
spare
us
pain
we
went
our
ways
with
too
forgetful
feet
and
missed
the
chance
that
would
not
come
again
leaving
with
thoughts
on
pleasure
bent
or
gain
fidelity
unattested
and
services
unrendered
the
ears
are
closed
the
heart
has
ceased
to
beat
and
now
all
proof
is
vain
too
late
for
other
gifts
i
give
you
this
who
took
from
you
so
much
so
carelessly
on
your
far
brows
a
first
and
phantom
kiss
on
your
far
grave
a
careful
elegy
for
one
who
loved
all
life
and
poetry
sorrow
in
music
bleeding
and
friendship
last
confession
but
even
as
i
speak
that
inner
kiss
softly
accuses
me
saying
those
brows
are
senseless
deaf
that
tomb
this
is
the
callous
cold
resort
of
art
i
give
you
this
what
do
i
give
to
whom
words
to
the
air
and
balm
to
my
own
heart
to
its
old
luxurious
and
commanded
smart
an
end
to
all
this
tuning
this
cynical
masquerading
what
comfort
now
in
that
far
final
gloom
can
any
song
impart
o
yet
i
see
you
dawning
from
some
heaven
who
would
not
suffer
to
live
in
one
to
whom
your
friendship
once
was
given
i
catch
a
vision
faint
and
fugitive
of
a
dark
face
with
eyes
contemplative
deep
eyes
that
smile
in
silence
and
parted
lips
that
whisper
say
nothing
more
old
friend
of
being
forgiven
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
wars
and
rumours
blood
hatred
appetite
and
apathy
the
sodden
many
and
the
struggling
strong
who
care
not
now
though
for
another
wrong
another
myriad
innocents
should
die
at
candid
savagery
or
oily
lie
we
laugh
or
turning
join
the
noisy
throng
which
buries
the
dead
with
gluttony
and
song
suppose
this
very
evening
from
on
high
broke
on
the
world
that
unexampled
flame
the
sky
and
thou
descending
lord
what
agony
of
horror
fear
and
shame
for
those
who
knew
and
wearied
of
thy
word
i
dare
not
even
think
who
am
confest
idle
malignant
lustful
as
the
rest
to
a
musician
musician
with
the
bent
and
brooding
face
white
brow
and
thunderous
eyes
you
are
not
playing
merely
the
music
that
dead
hand
did
trace
musician
with
the
lifted
resolute
face
and
scornful
smile
about
your
closed
mouth
straying
and
hand
that
moves
with
swift
or
fluttering
grace
it
is
not
that
man
music
you
are
playing
the
grave
and
merry
tunes
he
made
you
are
playing
each
march
and
dirge
and
dance
he
made
endures
but
changed
and
mastered
and
these
things
you
saying
these
joys
and
sorrows
are
not
his
but
yours
you
take
those
notes
of
his
you
seize
and
fling
his
music
as
a
dancer
flings
her
veil
toss
it
and
twist
it
mould
it
make
it
sing
whisper
shout
savagely
lament
and
wail
rush
like
a
hurricane
pause
and
faint
and
fail
and
as
i
watch
my
body
and
soul
are
bound
helpless
immovable
in
thongs
of
sound
lonely
and
strange
musician
standing
there
your
bent
ear
listening
to
your
own
soul
speaking
i
hear
vibrating
on
the
smitten
air
the
crying
of
your
suffering
and
your
seeking
agonised
raptured
frustrate
you
are
haunted
pursued
beset
beleaguered
filled
possessed
by
all
you
are
all
things
you
have
lost
and
wanted
things
clear
too
clear
things
only
to
be
guessed
i
do
not
know
what
earlier
scenes
you
knew
what
sweet
reproachful
memories
you
hold
of
broken
dreams
you
had
before
you
grew
so
conscious
and
so
lonely
and
so
old
i
do
not
know
what
women
words
have
taught
your
heart
and
only
dimly
know
by
name
the
many
wandering
cities
where
you
have
sought
splendour
and
found
the
hollowness
of
fame
or
where
your
sad
and
gentle
reveries
pass
to
family
and
home
who
have
for
signs
of
all
your
childhood
only
the
imagined
grass
of
a
bright
steppe
the
wind
running
in
lines
and
only
some
old
of
sleighing
dark
forests
endless
turning
pines
bells
tinkling
and
wolves
howling
and
hounds
baying
vague
is
your
past
yet
as
your
violin
sings
its
wildness
held
in
desperate
control
i
know
them
all
that
world
of
bygone
things
that
have
left
their
wounds
and
wonders
in
your
soul
out
in
all
weathers
you
have
been
my
friend
climbed
into
dawn
stood
solitary
and
stark
against
the
ashen
quiet
of
twilight
end
brooded
beneath
the
night
unanswering
dark
through
battering
tempests
you
have
blindly
won
and
lived
and
found
a
medicine
for
your
scars
in
resolution
taken
from
the
sun
and
consolation
from
the
unsleeping
stars
and
here
in
this
crowded
place
an
hour
staying
your
dim
orchestra
measuring
off
your
bars
so
pale
and
proud
you
stand
your
secrets
flaying
resolving
the
tangle
pouring
through
your
song
all
your
deep
ache
for
beauty
calm
above
your
bitter
silent
anger
and
the
strong
ferocity
and
tenderness
of
your
love
loud
challenges
and
sweet
and
cynic
laughter
movements
of
joy
spontaneous
and
pure
remorse
and
the
dull
grief
that
glimmers
after
the
obstinate
sins
you
know
you
will
not
cure
i
see
you
subtly
lying
soberly
weighing
gross
questions
jesting
at
the
things
you
hate
in
apathy
and
wild
despair
and
praying
bowed
down
before
the
shadowy
knees
of
fate
and
fearfully
behind
the
visible
groping
and
standing
by
the
heart
bottomless
pit
and
shrinking
who
have
known
the
lure
and
mockery
of
hoping
the
comic
terrible
uselessness
of
thinking
o
gay
and
passionate
gloomy
and
serene
your
quivering
fingers
laugh
and
weep
and
curse
for
all
the
phantoms
you
have
ever
been
yet
would
you
wish
another
universe
let
peace
come
if
it
will
your
last
long
note
dies
on
the
quiet
breast
of
space
and
now
they
clap
i
see
again
your
square
frock
coat
dark
foreign
fiddler
you
have
stopped
you
bow
the
rugger
match
oxford
and
cambridge
queen
december
hugh
i
the
walls
make
a
funnel
packed
full
the
distant
gate
bars
us
from
inaccessible
light
and
peace
far
over
necks
and
ears
and
hats
i
see
policemen
helmets
and
cards
hung
on
the
ironwork
one
shilling
no
change
given
only
oh
lord
what
an
awful
crush
there
are
faces
pale
and
strained
and
faces
with
animal
grins
advancing
stuck
fast
around
mine
we
move
we
pause
again
for
an
age
then
a
forward
wave
and
another
stop
the
pressure
might
squeeze
one
flat
dig
heels
into
ground
for
this
white
and
terrified
woman
whose
male
insists
upon
room
to
get
back
why
did
i
come
here
at
one
why
come
here
at
all
what
strange
little
creatures
we
are
wedged
and
shoving
under
the
contemptuous
sky
all
things
have
stopped
the
time
will
never
go
by
we
shall
never
get
in
yet
through
the
standing
glass
the
sand
imperceptible
drops
the
inexorable
laws
of
number
work
also
here
they
are
passing
and
passing
i
can
hear
the
tick
of
the
turnstiles
tick
tick
tick
a
man
a
woman
a
man
shreds
of
the
crowd
a
man
a
man
till
the
vortex
sucks
me
in
and
squeezed
between
strangers
hurting
the
flat
of
my
arms
i
am
jetted
forth
and
pay
my
shilling
and
pass
to
freedom
and
space
and
a
cool
for
the
matted
brows
but
we
can
not
rest
yet
fast
from
the
gates
we
issue
spread
conelike
out
a
crowd
of
loosening
tissue
all
jigging
on
and
making
as
we
travel
pod
pod
of
feet
on
earth
chix
chix
on
gravel
heads
forward
striding
eagerly
we
keep
round
to
the
left
in
sweep
by
the
back
of
a
stand
excluded
noting
the
row
of
heads
that
speck
the
top
and
caverned
below
the
raw
rough
timber
back
of
the
mound
quicker
the
place
is
swarming
around
around
till
the
edge
is
reached
and
we
see
a
patch
of
green
two
masts
with
a
crossbar
tapering
white
and
clean
and
confluent
rows
of
people
that
merge
and
die
in
a
flutter
of
faces
where
the
blocks
the
sky
we
hurry
along
past
ragged
files
of
faces
flushing
and
quick
peering
for
empty
places
i
see
one
above
me
i
step
and
prise
and
climb
and
stand
and
turn
and
breathe
and
look
at
the
time
survey
the
field
and
note
with
superior
glance
the
anxious
bobbing
fools
who
still
advance
ii
ah
they
are
coming
still
it
is
filling
up
it
is
full
they
come
there
is
almost
an
hour
to
go
yet
all
find
room
the
dribbles
of
black
disappear
in
the
solid
piles
around
that
empty
green
we
are
packed
and
ready
now
they
might
as
well
start
but
was
their
time
and
it
only
ten
past
and
it
got
to
be
lived
through
i
have
a
newspaper
i
wish
i
could
steal
that
little
parson
book
i
count
three
minutes
slowly
they
seem
like
an
hour
and
then
i
change
feet
and
loosen
the
brim
of
my
hat
and
curse
the
crawling
of
time
oh
body
body
why
did
i
order
you
here
to
stand
and
feel
tired
to
ache
and
ache
when
the
time
will
never
pass
in
this
buzzing
crowd
before
all
those
laden
housetops
around
this
turf
under
the
lid
of
the
sky
i
fumble
my
watch
again
it
is
minutes
to
wait
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
what
is
the
good
of
counting
it
wo
be
here
any
quicker
aching
hips
bored
brain
unquiet
heart
you
are
doomed
to
wait
why
did
i
make
you
come
we
have
been
before
struggling
with
time
fatigued
and
dull
and
alone
in
all
this
tumultuous
chattering
happy
crowd
that
never
knew
pain
and
never
questions
its
acts
never
questions
do
not
deceive
yourself
look
at
the
faces
around
you
active
and
gay
they
are
lined
there
are
brains
behind
them
breasts
beneath
them
they
have
only
escaped
for
an
hour
and
even
now
many
like
you
have
not
escaped
and
away
across
the
field
those
faces
ascending
in
tiers
each
face
is
a
story
a
tragedy
and
a
doubt
and
the
teams
where
they
wait
in
the
sacred
place
to
the
right
are
bewildered
souls
who
have
heard
of
and
brooded
on
death
and
thought
about
god
but
this
is
a
football
match
and
anyhow
i
do
feel
equal
to
thinking
and
i
certain
the
teams
do
they
something
better
to
do
it
is
two
and
thank
heaven
a
minute
over
we
are
all
here
now
the
laggards
have
all
booked
seats
and
stroll
in
lordly
leisure
along
the
front
what
a
man
six
foot
silk
hat
brown
face
moustache
what
a
fat
complacent
parson
snuggling
down
in
the
chair
there
among
all
his
cackling
ladies
i
have
seen
that
youth
before
my
neighbour
now
on
my
left
shouts
out
to
a
college
friend
below
us
tommy
hallo
do
you
think
we
are
going
to
beat
my
watch
that
lot
went
quickly
five
minutes
more
is
nothing
i
lively
now
and
fit
for
a
run
one
two
three
four
it
is
worth
bothering
now
it
all
but
here
here
here
a
rustle
a
murmur
a
ready
silence
a
billowing
cheer
why
here
they
come
running
and
passing
the
challenging
team
by
god
what
magnificent
fellows
they
have
dropped
the
ball
they
pause
they
sweep
onward
again
and
so
to
the
end
here
are
the
rest
of
them
swingingly
up
the
field
and
back
as
they
came
with
the
cheers
swelling
and
swelling
they
disappear
and
out
like
wind
upon
water
come
their
rivals
with
cheers
swelling
and
swelling
to
run
and
turn
and
vanish
and
now
they
are
all
come
out
together
two
teams
walking
and
referee
and
they
all
line
up
dotted
about
like
chessmen
and
the
multitude
holds
its
breath
and
awaits
the
start
iii
whistle
a
kick
a
rush
a
scramble
a
scrum
the
forwards
are
busy
already
the
halves
hover
round
the
stand
in
backwards
diverging
lines
eagerly
bent
atoe
with
elbows
back
and
hands
that
would
grasp
at
a
ball
trembling
to
start
while
the
solid
backs
vigilant
stray
about
and
the
crowd
gives
out
a
steady
resolute
roar
like
the
roar
of
a
sea
a
scrum
a
whistle
a
scrum
a
burst
a
whistle
a
scrum
a
kick
into
touch
all
in
the
middle
of
the
field
he
is
tossing
it
in
they
have
got
it
and
downed
it
and
whurry
oh
here
they
come
streaming
like
a
waterfall
oh
he
has
knocked
it
on
right
at
our
feet
and
the
scrum
is
formed
again
and
everything
seems
to
stop
while
they
pack
and
go
crooked
the
beats
them
straight
with
a
rough
smack
while
he
holds
the
ball
debonair
how
it
all
comes
back
as
the
steam
goes
up
of
their
breath
and
their
sweating
trunks
the
head
low
down
the
eyes
that
swim
to
the
ground
the
mesh
of
ownerless
knees
the
patch
of
dark
earth
the
ball
that
comes
in
and
wedges
and
jerks
and
is
caught
and
sticks
the
dense
intoxicant
smell
of
sweat
the
grip
on
the
moisture
of
jerseys
the
sickening
urge
that
seems
powerless
to
help
the
desperate
final
shove
that
somehow
is
timed
with
a
general
effort
the
sweep
onward
while
enemies
reel
and
the
whole
scrum
turns
and
we
torrent
away
with
the
ball
oh
i
know
it
all
i
know
it
where
are
they
far
on
the
opposite
line
aimlessly
kicking
while
the
forwards
stand
gaping
about
deprived
of
their
work
convergence
they
are
coming
again
they
are
scrumming
again
below
red
hair
black
cap
and
a
horde
of
dark
colourless
heads
and
straining
backs
a
voice
rasps
up
through
the
howl
of
the
crowd
around
triumphant
now
in
possession
over
all
the
rest
of
crowds
who
have
lost
the
moving
treasure
to
us
push
you
devils
they
push
and
push
and
push
the
opponents
yield
the
fortress
wall
goes
down
the
ram
goes
through
an
irresistible
rush
crosses
the
last
white
line
and
tumbles
down
and
the
ball
is
there
a
try
a
try
a
try
the
shout
from
the
host
we
are
assaults
the
sky
deep
silence
line
up
by
the
a
man
lying
down
poising
the
pointed
ball
slanted
away
and
another
who
stands
and
hesitates
and
runs
and
lunges
out
with
his
foot
and
the
ball
soars
up
while
the
opposite
forwards
rush
below
it
in
vain
and
curves
to
the
posts
and
passes
them
just
outside
the
flag
hangs
still
it
was
only
a
try
three
points
to
us
the
roar
is
continuous
now
the
game
swings
to
and
fro
like
a
pendulum
struck
by
a
violent
hand
but
the
impetus
wanes
the
forwards
are
getting
tired
and
all
the
outsides
run
weakly
pass
loosely
there
are
one
or
two
penalty
kicks
and
a
feeble
attempt
from
a
mark
the
ball
goes
out
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
comes
wearily
back
and
lingering
about
in
the
tedious
game
seems
for
a
while
a
thing
interminable
and
nothing
happens
till
all
of
a
sudden
a
shrill
blast
from
the
whistle
flies
out
and
arrests
the
game
unlocking
the
players
are
all
erect
easy
and
friendly
standing
about
in
groups
figures
in
sculpture
better
for
clothes
couples
from
either
side
chatting
and
laughing
and
chewing
lemons
and
throwing
the
rinds
away
iv
the
pause
is
over
they
part
from
each
other
sift
out
the
backs
trot
out
to
their
stations
the
forwards
spread
the
captains
beckon
with
hands
and
the
ball
goes
off
to
volleys
and
answering
volleys
of
harsher
cheers
for
the
top
of
the
hill
is
past
we
course
to
the
close
we
a
lead
can
we
keep
it
it
is
enough
we
have
always
heard
their
were
better
than
ours
if
they
once
get
the
ball
they
have
got
it
he
runs
he
passes
the
centre
dodges
is
tackled
passes
in
time
to
the
other
centre
who
goes
like
a
bird
to
the
left
and
flings
it
out
to
the
wing
the
goal
is
open
he
has
only
to
run
as
he
can
no
the
back
is
across
he
has
missed
him
he
has
him
they
topple
head
over
heels
and
the
ball
bumps
along
into
touch
they
are
stuck
on
our
line
scrum
after
scrum
with
those
dangerous
threes
standing
waiting
threat
after
threat
forced
back
a
save
a
return
and
the
same
thing
over
again
till
the
ball
goes
out
almost
unnoticed
and
before
we
can
see
what
is
done
that
centre
has
kicked
he
has
thought
of
the
four
points
the
ball
soars
slackens
keeps
upright
with
effort
then
floats
between
posts
and
falls
ignored
to
the
ground
its
grandeur
gone
while
the
flaps
his
flag
and
the
multitude
becomes
an
enormous
din
which
dies
as
the
game
resumes
and
then
rises
again
as
battle
of
cry
of
triumph
and
defiant
like
great
waves
surging
against
each
other
they
work
to
the
other
corner
they
stay
there
long
they
push
and
wheel
there
are
runs
that
come
to
nothing
till
the
noise
wanes
and
a
curious
silence
comes
they
lead
by
a
point
their
crowd
is
sobered
now
anxious
still
lest
a
sudden
chance
should
come
or
a
sudden
resource
of
power
in
mysterious
foes
which
may
dash
them
again
from
their
new
precarious
peak
whilst
we
in
our
hearts
are
aware
of
the
chilling
touch
of
loss
of
a
fatal
thing
irrevocable
feel
the
time
fly
to
the
dreaded
last
wail
of
the
whistle
and
see
our
team
as
desperate
waves
that
dash
against
a
wall
of
rock
to
be
scattered
in
spray
yet
fervour
comes
back
for
the
players
have
no
thought
for
the
past
except
as
a
goad
to
new
effort
not
they
will
be
chilled
fiercer
and
faster
they
fight
a
grimness
comes
into
shoving
and
running
and
tackling
and
handing
off
we
are
heeling
the
ball
now
cleanly
time
after
time
our
half
picks
it
up
and
instantly
jabs
it
away
and
the
beautiful
swift
diagonal
tips
it
across
for
the
wing
to
go
like
a
stag
till
he
cornered
and
falls
and
the
gate
swings
shut
again
thirty
fighting
devils
ten
thousand
throats
thundering
joy
at
each
pass
and
tackle
and
punt
yet
the
consciousness
grows
that
the
time
approaches
the
end
the
threat
of
conclusion
grows
like
a
spreading
tree
and
casts
its
shadow
on
all
the
anxious
people
and
is
fully
known
when
they
stop
as
a
man
knocked
out
and
limps
from
the
field
with
his
arms
round
two
comrades
necks
the
gradual
time
seems
to
have
suddenly
leapt
and
all
this
while
the
unheeded
winter
sky
has
faded
and
the
air
gone
bluer
and
mistier
the
players
when
they
drift
away
to
a
corner
distant
from
us
seem
to
have
left
our
world
we
see
the
struggling
forms
tangling
and
tumbling
we
hear
the
noise
from
the
featureless
mass
around
them
but
the
dusk
divides
finality
seems
to
have
come
nothing
can
happen
now
the
attention
drifts
there
a
pause
i
become
a
separate
thing
again
almost
forget
the
game
forget
my
neighbours
and
the
noise
fades
in
my
ears
to
a
dim
rumour
i
watch
the
lines
and
colours
of
field
and
buildings
so
simple
and
soft
and
few
in
the
vapoury
air
i
am
held
by
the
brightening
orange
lights
of
the
matches
perpetually
pricking
the
haze
across
the
ground
and
the
scene
is
tinged
with
a
quiet
melancholy
the
harmonious
sadness
of
twilight
on
willowed
waters
still
avenues
or
harbours
seen
from
the
sea
yet
a
louder
shout
recalls
me
i
wake
again
find
there
are
two
minutes
left
and
it
nearly
over
see
a
few
weaklings
already
walking
out
caring
more
to
avoid
a
crush
with
the
crowd
than
to
give
the
last
stroke
to
a
ritual
of
courtesy
and
a
work
of
intangible
art
but
we
all
getting
ready
hope
gone
and
fear
except
in
the
battling
teams
regret
a
quick
movement
of
hazy
forms
oh
quiet
oh
look
there
is
something
happening
sudden
one
phantom
form
on
the
other
wing
emerges
from
nothingness
is
singled
out
curving
in
a
long
sweep
like
a
flying
gull
through
the
thick
fog
swifter
as
borne
by
wind
swerves
at
the
place
where
the
must
be
and
runs
by
heaven
he
over
and
runs
and
runs
and
our
hearts
leap
and
our
sticks
go
up
in
the
air
and
our
hats
whirl
and
we
lose
ourselves
in
a
yell
for
a
try
behind
the
posts
we
have
beaten
them
v
outside
and
a
mob
hailing
cabs
besieging
the
station
sticks
overcoats
scarves
bowler
hats
intensified
faces
rushes
apologies
voices
simpson
at
seven
hallo
jim
see
you
next
term
i
just
seen
old
peter
they
go
to
their
homes
to
catch
trains
all
over
the
city
all
over
england
or
many
to
make
a
good
night
of
it
eat
oysters
drink
more
than
usual
dispute
of
the
match
for
the
match
is
all
over
and
what
being
done
does
it
matter
what
happened
last
year
i
was
here
i
should
know
but
i
do
next
year
there
will
be
another
with
another
result
just
such
another
crowd
just
as
excited
and
after
next
year
for
a
year
and
a
year
and
a
year
till
customs
have
changed
and
things
crumbled
and
all
this
strife
is
a
dim
word
from
the
past
why
even
when
the
last
door
has
been
locked
the
last
groundsman
will
go
leaving
that
field
which
was
conquered
and
full
of
men
with
darkened
houses
around
void
and
awake
silently
talking
to
the
silent
travelling
moon
the
day
passed
they
have
gone
again
they
will
die
in
the
moon
the
neighbouring
roofs
will
lie
lonely
and
still
all
of
their
dwellers
in
bed
the
phantom
stands
will
glisten
the
rise
slanting
their
shadows
across
the
grass
as
calm
as
though
they
had
never
challenged
an
eager
swarm
or
any
ball
had
made
their
crossbars
quiver
clouds
will
pass
and
the
city
murmur
fade
and
the
open
field
await
its
destiny
of
transient
invaders
coming
and
going
what
was
the
point
of
it
why
did
the
heart
leap
high
putting
reason
back
to
watch
that
fugitive
play
why
not
we
must
all
distract
ourselves
with
toys
not
a
brick
nor
a
heap
remains
the
more
durable
product
of
all
that
effort
and
pain
yet
sooner
or
later
as
much
may
be
said
of
any
human
game
war
politics
art
building
planting
and
ploughing
the
explorer
freezing
the
astronomer
searching
of
stars
the
philosopher
fight
through
the
thickening
webs
of
thought
and
the
writing
of
poems
a
hand
a
stir
and
a
sinking
and
so
no
more
of
the
general
game
of
the
race
that
can
not
know
of
its
origin
or
its
end
but
strives
for
their
own
sake
its
courage
and
skill
to
increase
till
frost
or
a
flying
flame
calls
time
i
have
seen
this
day
men
in
the
beauty
of
movement
a
gallant
jaw
set
the
form
of
a
hero
that
flew
cunning
a
selfless
flinging
of
self
in
the
fray
strength
compassion
control
the
obeying
of
laws
victory
and
a
struggle
against
defeat
i
think
that
the
power
that
gave
us
the
bodies
we
have
can
only
be
praised
by
our
use
of
the
things
he
gave
that
we
are
not
here
to
turn
our
backs
to
the
sun
or
to
scorn
the
delight
of
our
limbs
and
for
those
who
have
eyes
the
beauty
of
this
is
the
same
as
the
beauty
of
flowers
and
of
eagles
and
lions
and
mountains
and
oceans
and
stars
and
i
care
not
but
rather
am
glad
that
the
thought
will
recur
that
in
egypt
the
muscles
moved
under
the
shining
skins
as
here
and
in
greece
where
olympian
champions
died
and
in
isles
long
ago
where
never
a
record
was
kept
and
now
i
go
home
and
open
a
bottle
of
port
and
think
upon
beauty
and
god
and
the
wonder
of
love
that
laughs
at
the
shadow
of
death
and
my
vanished
youth
and
the
throbbing
heart
that
beats
its
own
drum
to
the
grave
returning
absurdly
again
to
the
fact
that
we
won
content
to
let
darkness
deepen
and
stars
shine
