part
i
i
sat
and
sewed
and
sang
some
tender
tune
oh
beauteous
was
that
morn
in
early
june
mellow
with
sunlight
and
with
blossoms
fair
the
climbing
grew
about
me
there
and
checked
with
shade
the
sunny
portico
where
morns
like
this
i
came
to
read
or
sew
i
heard
the
gate
click
and
a
firm
quick
tread
upon
the
walk
no
need
to
turn
my
head
i
would
mistake
and
doubt
my
own
voice
sounding
before
his
step
upon
the
gravel
bounding
in
an
unstudied
attitude
of
grace
he
stretched
his
comely
form
and
from
his
face
he
tossed
the
dark
damp
curls
and
at
my
knees
with
his
broad
hat
he
fanned
the
lazy
breeze
and
turned
his
head
and
lifted
his
large
eyes
of
that
strange
hue
we
see
in
ocean
dyes
and
call
it
blue
sometimes
and
sometimes
green
and
save
in
poet
eyes
not
elsewhere
seen
i
should
meet
with
my
fair
scorning
for
calling
quite
so
early
in
the
morning
brought
a
passport
that
can
never
fail
he
said
and
laughing
laid
the
morning
mail
upon
my
lap
welcome
so
i
thought
figure
by
the
letters
that
i
brought
how
glad
you
are
to
see
me
only
one
and
that
one
from
a
lady
undone
that
lightly
skimmed
think
me
a
bore
and
wonder
why
i
did
not
bring
you
four
ever
thus
a
woman
can
not
get
so
many
letters
that
she
will
not
fret
one
that
did
not
prove
you
wrong
i
answered
gaily
upon
the
spot
this
little
letter
precious
if
not
long
is
just
the
one
of
all
you
might
have
brought
to
please
me
you
have
heard
me
speak
sure
of
helen
trevor
she
writes
here
to
say
coming
out
to
see
me
and
will
stay
till
autumn
maybe
she
is
like
her
note
petite
and
dainty
tender
loving
pure
know
her
by
a
letter
that
she
wrote
for
a
sweet
tinted
thing
always
so
letters
all
blots
though
finely
written
show
a
slovenly
person
letters
stiff
and
white
bespeak
a
nature
honest
plain
upright
and
tissuey
tinted
perfumed
notes
like
this
tell
of
a
creature
formed
to
pet
and
my
listener
heard
me
with
a
slow
odd
smile
stretched
in
abandon
at
my
feet
the
while
he
fanned
me
idly
with
his
hat
all
young
ladies
must
be
formed
for
that
he
laughed
and
said
letters
read
and
look
as
like
as
twenty
copies
of
one
book
written
in
a
dainty
spider
scrawl
to
precious
kate
or
or
the
friend
they
ever
had
they
say
they
to
see
you
oh
so
bad
vow
you
never
oh
and
then
they
tell
about
a
splendid
a
lovely
charming
dress
and
send
a
little
scrap
of
this
to
every
friend
and
then
to
close
for
lack
of
something
better
they
beg
and
burn
this
horrid
he
watched
me
smiling
he
was
prone
to
vex
and
hector
me
with
flings
upon
my
sex
he
liked
he
said
to
have
me
flash
and
frown
so
he
could
tease
me
and
then
laugh
me
down
my
storms
of
wrath
amused
him
very
much
he
liked
to
see
me
go
off
at
a
touch
anger
became
my
colour
rise
and
gave
an
added
lustre
to
my
eyes
so
he
would
so
he
watched
me
now
to
see
the
hot
flush
mantle
cheek
and
brow
instead
i
answered
coolly
with
a
smile
felling
a
seam
with
utmost
care
meanwhile
caustic
tongue
of
vivian
dangerfield
is
barbed
as
ever
for
my
sex
this
morn
still
unconvinced
no
smallest
point
i
yield
woman
i
love
and
trust
despite
your
scorn
there
is
some
truth
in
what
you
say
well
yes
your
statements
usually
hold
more
or
less
some
women
write
weak
some
men
do
some
make
professions
knowing
them
untrue
and
friendship
in
the
time
of
need
i
own
too
often
proves
a
broken
reed
but
i
believe
and
ever
will
contend
woman
can
be
a
sister
friend
giving
from
out
her
large
bounteous
store
a
living
to
do
no
more
than
through
and
by
that
love
she
knows
she
can
and
living
by
her
professions
a
and
such
a
tie
true
silken
tether
binds
helen
heart
and
mine
together
i
love
her
for
her
beauty
meekness
grace
for
her
white
lily
soul
and
angel
face
she
loves
me
for
my
greater
strength
maybe
would
give
her
best
blood
for
me
and
i
to
save
her
from
a
pain
or
cross
would
suffer
any
sacrifice
or
loss
such
can
be
friendship
for
another
could
man
give
more
or
ask
more
from
a
brother
i
paused
and
vivian
leaned
his
massive
head
against
the
pillar
of
the
portico
smiled
his
slow
sceptic
smile
then
laughed
and
said
surely
what
you
say
be
so
made
a
statement
but
no
at
hand
not
flash
your
eyes
so
understand
i
think
you
quite
sincere
in
what
you
say
you
love
your
friend
and
she
loves
you
but
friendship
is
not
friendship
at
the
best
till
circumstances
put
it
to
the
test
less
demonstrative
stands
strain
and
tear
while
half
profession
fails
to
wear
two
women
love
each
other
passing
say
helen
trevor
and
maurine
la
pelle
just
for
example
let
them
daily
meet
at
ball
and
concert
in
the
church
and
street
they
kiss
and
coo
they
visit
chat
caress
their
love
increases
rather
than
grows
less
and
all
goes
well
till
discovers
that
wins
too
many
lovers
and
then
her
friend
her
her
becomes
a
a
all
let
helen
smile
too
oft
on
beaux
or
wear
more
stylish
or
becoming
clothes
or
sport
a
hat
that
has
a
longer
and
lo
the
strain
has
broken
sweet
smile
becomes
a
frown
or
pout
just
begun
to
find
that
helen
the
breach
grows
fills
each
heart
they
drift
asunder
whom
death
could
you
shake
your
head
oh
well
never
know
it
is
not
likely
fate
will
test
you
so
live
and
love
and
meeting
twice
a
year
while
life
shall
last
hold
each
other
dear
i
pray
it
may
be
so
it
were
not
best
to
shake
your
faith
in
woman
by
the
test
keep
your
belief
and
nurse
it
while
you
can
faith
in
friendship
man
true
as
steel
as
mothers
friends
and
wives
and
enough
to
bless
us
all
our
lives
that
a
selfish
fellow
and
a
bore
who
is
unsatisfied
and
asks
for
there
is
need
of
more
i
here
broke
in
hold
that
woman
guilty
of
a
sin
who
would
not
cling
to
and
defend
another
as
nobly
as
she
would
stand
by
a
brother
who
would
not
suffer
for
a
sake
and
were
there
need
to
prove
her
friendship
make
any
sacrifice
nor
count
the
cost
who
would
not
do
this
for
a
friend
is
lost
to
every
nobler
shame
cried
vivian
laughing
you
now
defame
the
whole
sweet
sex
since
not
one
would
do
the
thing
you
name
nor
would
i
want
her
to
i
love
the
sex
my
mother
was
a
i
hope
my
wife
will
be
and
wholly
human
and
if
she
wants
to
make
some
sacrifice
think
her
far
more
sensible
and
wise
to
let
her
husband
reap
the
benefit
instead
of
some
old
maid
or
senseless
chit
selfish
of
course
i
hold
all
love
is
so
and
i
shall
love
my
wife
right
well
i
know
now
a
point
regarding
selfish
love
you
thirst
to
argue
with
me
and
disprove
but
since
these
cosy
hours
will
soon
be
gone
and
all
our
meetings
broken
in
upon
no
more
of
these
rare
moments
must
be
spent
in
vain
discussions
or
in
argument
i
wish
miss
trevor
was
you
see
the
selfishness
begins
to
show
she
wants
to
see
you
do
i
but
she
will
gain
her
wish
by
taking
you
from
me
all
the
same
that
means
be
allowed
to
realize
that
can
make
a
i
do
not
like
to
feel
myself
with
two
girl
cronies
would
i
not
be
so
my
ring
would
interrupt
some
private
chat
ask
me
in
and
take
my
cane
and
hat
and
speak
about
the
lovely
summer
day
and
lout
i
wish
kept
miss
smile
but
just
to
hide
a
pout
and
count
the
moments
till
i
was
shown
out
and
while
i
twirled
my
thumbs
i
would
sit
wishing
that
i
had
gone
off
hunting
birds
or
fishing
no
thanks
maurine
the
iron
hand
of
fate
or
otherwise
miss
dainty
fingers
will
bar
my
entrance
into
gate
and
i
shall
be
like
some
poor
soul
that
lingers
at
portal
paying
the
price
of
sin
yet
hoping
to
be
pardoned
and
let
he
looked
so
melancholy
sitting
there
i
laughed
outright
well
you
act
a
part
you
look
the
very
picture
of
despair
missed
your
calling
sir
suppose
you
start
upon
a
starring
tour
and
carve
your
name
with
and
on
the
heights
of
fame
but
now
tabooing
nonsense
i
shall
send
for
you
to
help
me
entertain
my
friend
unless
you
come
without
it
true
wanting
our
as
cronies
do
and
take
those
while
you
are
reading
greek
or
writing
to
or
but
when
you
have
an
hour
or
two
of
leisure
call
as
you
now
do
and
afford
like
pleasure
for
never
yet
did
sun
shine
on
or
stars
discover
that
phenomenon
in
any
country
or
in
any
clime
two
maids
so
bound
by
ties
of
mind
and
heart
they
did
not
feel
the
heavy
weight
of
time
in
weeks
of
scenes
wherein
no
man
took
part
god
made
the
sexes
to
associate
nor
law
of
man
nor
stern
decree
of
fate
can
ever
undo
what
his
hand
has
done
and
quite
alone
make
happy
either
one
my
helen
is
an
only
child
pet
of
loving
parents
and
she
never
yet
has
been
denied
one
boon
for
which
she
pleaded
a
fragile
thing
her
lightest
wish
was
heeded
would
she
pluck
roses
they
must
first
be
shorn
by
careful
hands
of
every
hateful
thorn
and
loving
eyes
must
scan
the
pathway
where
her
feet
may
tread
to
see
no
stones
are
there
grow
dull
here
in
this
secluded
nook
unless
you
aid
me
in
the
pleasant
task
of
entertaining
drop
in
with
your
read
talk
sing
for
her
sometimes
what
i
ask
do
once
to
please
me
then
be
no
need
for
me
to
state
the
case
again
or
plead
nothing
like
a
grace
and
beauty
to
waken
mankind
to
a
sense
of
bow
before
the
mandate
of
my
queen
your
slightest
wish
is
law
ma
belle
maurine
he
answered
smiling
at
your
command
point
but
one
lily
finger
or
your
wand
and
you
will
find
a
willing
slave
obeying
there
goes
my
dinner
bell
i
hear
it
saying
spent
two
hours
here
lying
at
your
feet
not
profitable
sweet
all
time
is
money
now
were
i
to
measure
the
time
i
spend
here
by
its
solid
pleasure
and
that
were
coined
in
dollars
then
laid
each
day
a
fortune
at
your
feet
fair
maid
there
goes
that
bell
again
say
or
clouds
will
shadow
my
domestic
sky
come
again
as
you
would
have
me
do
and
see
your
friend
while
she
is
seeing
you
like
by
proxy
being
at
a
feast
unsatisfactory
to
say
the
he
drew
his
fine
shape
up
and
trod
the
land
with
kingly
grace
passing
the
gate
his
hand
he
lightly
placed
the
garden
wall
upon
leaped
over
like
a
leopard
and
was
gone
and
going
took
the
brightness
from
the
place
yet
left
the
june
day
with
a
sweeter
grace
and
my
young
soul
so
steeped
in
happy
dreams
heaven
itself
seemed
shown
to
me
in
gleams
there
is
a
time
with
lovers
when
the
heart
first
slowly
rouses
from
its
dreamless
sleep
to
all
the
tumult
of
a
passion
life
ere
yet
have
wakened
jealousy
and
strife
just
as
a
young
untutored
child
will
start
out
of
a
long
slumber
sound
and
deep
and
lie
and
smile
with
rosy
lips
and
cheeks
in
a
sweet
restful
trance
before
it
speaks
a
time
when
yet
no
word
the
spell
has
broken
save
what
the
heart
unto
the
soul
has
spoken
in
quickened
throbs
and
sighs
but
half
suppressed
a
time
when
that
sweet
truth
all
unconfessed
gives
added
fragrance
to
the
summer
flowers
a
golden
glory
to
the
passing
hours
a
hopeful
beauty
to
the
plainest
face
and
lends
to
life
a
new
and
tender
grace
when
the
full
heart
has
climbed
the
heights
of
bliss
and
smiling
looks
back
the
golden
past
i
think
it
finds
no
sweeter
hour
than
this
in
all
for
later
when
the
last
translucent
drop
the
cup
of
joy
and
love
more
mighty
than
the
control
surges
in
words
of
passion
from
the
soul
and
vows
are
asked
and
given
shadows
rise
like
mists
before
the
sun
in
noonday
skies
vague
fears
that
prove
the
brimming
alloy
a
dread
of
crowning
curse
since
what
is
perfect
change
but
renders
worse
a
vain
desire
to
cripple
time
who
goes
bearing
our
joys
away
and
bringing
woes
and
later
doubts
and
jealousies
awaken
and
plighted
hearts
are
and
shaken
doubt
sends
a
test
that
goes
a
step
too
far
a
wound
is
made
that
healing
leaves
a
scar
or
one
heart
full
with
sweet
satisfaction
thinks
truth
once
spoken
always
understood
while
one
is
pining
for
the
tender
action
and
whispered
word
by
which
of
old
wooed
but
this
blest
hour
in
glad
golden
day
is
like
the
dawning
ere
the
radiant
ray
of
glowing
sol
has
burst
upon
the
eye
but
yet
is
heralded
in
earth
and
sky
warm
with
its
fervour
mellow
with
its
light
while
care
still
slumbers
in
the
arms
of
night
but
hope
awake
hears
happy
birdlings
sing
and
thinks
of
all
a
summer
day
may
bring
in
this
sweet
calm
my
young
heart
lay
at
rest
filled
with
a
blissful
sense
of
peace
nor
guessed
that
sullen
clouds
were
gathering
in
the
skies
to
hide
the
glorious
sun
ere
it
should
rise
part
ii
to
little
birds
that
never
tire
of
humming
about
the
garden
in
the
summer
weather
aunt
ruth
compared
us
after
coming
as
we
two
roamed
or
sat
and
talked
together
twelve
months
apart
we
had
so
much
to
say
of
school
days
time
since
passed
away
of
that
old
friend
and
this
of
what
done
of
how
our
separate
paths
in
life
had
run
of
what
we
would
do
in
the
coming
years
of
plans
and
castles
hopes
and
dreams
and
fears
all
these
and
more
as
soon
as
we
found
speech
we
touched
upon
and
skimmed
from
this
to
that
but
at
the
first
each
only
gazed
on
each
and
dumb
with
joy
that
did
not
need
a
voice
like
lesser
joys
to
say
i
rejoice
with
smiling
eyes
and
clasping
hands
we
sat
wrapped
in
that
peace
felt
but
with
those
dear
contented
just
to
know
each
other
near
but
when
this
silent
eloquence
gave
place
to
words
like
the
rising
of
a
flood
above
a
dam
we
sat
there
face
to
face
and
let
our
talk
glide
on
it
would
speech
never
halting
in
its
speed
or
zest
save
when
our
rippling
laughter
let
it
rest
just
as
a
stream
will
sometimes
pause
and
play
about
a
bubbling
spring
then
dash
away
no
wonder
then
the
third
sun
was
nigh
up
to
the
zenith
when
my
friend
and
i
opened
our
eyes
from
slumber
long
and
deep
nature
demanding
recompense
for
hours
spent
in
the
portico
among
the
flowers
halves
of
two
nights
we
should
have
spent
in
sleep
so
this
third
day
we
breakfasted
at
one
then
walked
about
the
garden
in
the
sun
hearing
the
thrushes
and
the
robins
sing
and
looking
to
see
what
buds
were
opening
the
clock
chimed
three
and
we
yet
strayed
at
will
about
the
yard
in
morning
dishabille
when
aunt
ruth
came
with
apron
her
head
holding
a
letter
in
her
hand
and
said
is
a
note
from
vivian
i
opine
at
least
his
servant
brought
it
and
now
girls
you
may
think
this
is
no
concern
of
mine
but
in
my
day
young
ladies
did
not
go
till
almost
roaming
to
and
fro
in
morning
wrappers
and
with
tangled
curls
the
very
pictures
of
forlorn
distress
three
and
time
for
you
to
dress
come
read
your
note
and
hurry
in
maurine
and
make
yourself
fit
object
to
be
helen
was
bending
an
almond
bush
and
ere
she
looked
up
i
had
read
the
note
and
calmed
my
heart
that
bounding
sent
a
flush
to
brow
and
cheek
at
sight
of
aught
wrote
belle
maurine
so
billet
ran
it
not
time
i
saw
your
cherished
guest
the
sorrows
of
a
poor
young
man
banished
from
all
that
makes
existence
blest
dying
to
friend
and
i
will
come
and
pay
respects
hoping
be
at
home
at
eight
expectantly
inside
my
belt
i
slipped
the
billet
saying
go
make
yourself
most
fair
to
see
quick
hurry
now
no
time
for
more
delaying
in
just
five
hours
a
caller
will
be
here
and
you
must
look
your
prettiest
my
dear
begin
your
toilet
right
away
i
know
how
long
it
takes
you
to
arrange
each
to
twist
each
curl
and
loop
your
skirts
aright
and
you
must
prove
you
are
and
make
a
perfect
toilet
for
our
caller
is
man
and
critic
poet
artist
scholar
and
views
with
eyes
of
oh
maurine
cried
helen
with
a
look
of
fear
frightened
me
so
i
shall
not
appear
hide
away
refusing
to
be
seen
by
such
an
ogre
woe
is
me
bereft
of
all
my
friends
my
peaceful
home
left
and
strayed
away
into
the
dreadful
wood
to
meet
the
fate
of
poor
red
riding
hood
no
maurine
no
given
me
such
a
fright
not
go
near
your
ugly
wolf
meantime
left
the
garden
and
i
stood
in
room
where
she
had
thrown
herself
upon
a
couch
and
lay
a
winsome
elf
pouting
and
smiling
cheek
upon
her
arm
not
in
the
least
a
portrait
of
alarm
sweet
i
coaxed
and
knelt
by
her
good
go
curl
your
hair
and
please
your
own
maurine
by
putting
on
that
lovely
grenadine
not
wolf
nor
ogre
neither
caliban
nor
mephistopheles
meet
but
what
the
ladies
call
nice
young
yet
one
worth
with
health
and
might
of
perfect
manhood
gifted
noble
wise
moving
among
his
kind
with
loving
eyes
and
helpful
hand
progressive
brave
refined
after
the
image
of
his
now
maurine
cried
helen
believe
it
is
your
lover
coming
here
this
eve
why
have
you
never
written
of
him
pray
is
the
day
set
when
say
maurine
say
had
i
betrayed
by
some
too
fervent
word
the
secret
love
that
all
my
being
stirred
my
lover
ay
my
heart
proclaimed
him
so
but
first
lips
must
win
the
sweet
confession
ere
even
helen
be
allowed
to
know
i
must
straightway
erase
the
slight
impression
made
by
the
words
just
uttered
child
i
gaily
cried
straying
wild
just
let
a
girl
of
eighteen
hear
the
name
of
maid
and
youth
uttered
about
one
time
and
off
her
fancy
goes
at
pace
defying
circumstances
reason
and
straightway
builds
romances
so
sublime
they
put
all
dramas
to
the
shame
this
vivian
dangerfield
is
neighbour
friend
and
kind
companion
bringing
books
and
flowers
and
by
his
thoughtful
actions
without
end
helping
me
pass
some
otherwise
long
hours
but
he
has
never
breathed
a
word
of
love
if
you
still
doubt
me
listen
while
i
prove
my
statement
by
the
letter
that
he
wrote
to
friend
she
could
not
see
the
dash
between
that
meant
so
much
to
me
come
this
eve
at
eight
and
hopes
we
may
be
in
to
greet
now
i
think
say
not
much
like
a
tender
we
laugh
we
jest
not
meaning
what
we
say
we
hide
our
thoughts
by
light
words
lightly
spoken
and
pass
on
heedless
till
we
find
one
day
bruised
our
hearts
or
left
some
other
broken
i
sought
my
room
and
trilling
some
blithe
air
opened
my
wardrobe
wondering
what
to
wear
momentous
question
femininely
human
more
than
all
others
vexing
mind
of
woman
since
that
sad
day
when
in
her
discontent
to
search
for
leaves
our
fair
first
mother
went
all
undecided
what
i
should
put
on
at
length
i
made
selection
of
a
white
with
a
tiny
pink
vine
overrun
my
simplest
robe
but
favourite
one
and
placing
a
single
flowret
in
my
hair
i
crossed
the
hall
to
chamber
where
i
found
her
with
her
fair
locks
all
let
down
brushing
the
kinks
out
with
a
pretty
frown
like
a
picture
or
a
pleasing
play
to
watch
her
make
her
toilet
she
would
stand
and
turn
her
head
first
this
and
then
that
way
trying
effect
of
ribbon
bow
or
band
then
she
would
pick
up
something
else
and
curve
her
lovely
neck
with
cunning
grace
and
watch
the
mirror
while
she
put
it
on
with
such
a
sweetly
grave
and
thoughtful
face
and
then
to
view
it
all
would
sway
and
swerve
her
lithe
young
body
like
a
graceful
swan
helen
was
over
medium
height
and
slender
even
to
frailty
her
great
wistful
eyes
were
like
the
deep
blue
of
autumnal
skies
and
through
them
looked
her
soul
large
loving
tender
her
long
light
hair
was
lustreless
except
upon
the
ends
where
burnished
sunbeams
slept
and
on
the
earlocks
and
she
looped
the
curls
back
with
a
shell
comb
studded
thick
with
pearls
costly
yet
simple
her
pale
loveliness
that
night
was
heightened
by
her
rich
black
dress
that
trailed
behind
her
leaving
half
in
sight
her
taper
arms
and
shoulders
marble
white
i
was
not
tall
as
helen
and
my
face
was
shaped
and
coloured
like
my
race
for
through
his
veins
my
own
received
the
warm
red
blood
of
southern
france
which
curved
my
form
and
glowed
upon
my
cheek
in
crimson
dyes
and
bronzed
my
hair
and
darkled
in
my
eyes
and
as
the
morning
trails
the
skirts
of
night
and
dusky
night
puts
on
the
garb
of
morn
and
walk
together
when
the
day
is
born
so
we
two
glided
down
the
hall
and
stair
arm
clasping
arm
into
the
parlour
where
sat
vivian
bathed
in
gorgeous
light
he
rose
to
greet
us
oh
his
form
was
grand
and
he
possessed
that
power
strange
occult
called
magnetism
lacking
better
word
which
moves
the
world
achieving
great
result
where
genius
fails
completely
touch
his
hand
it
thrilled
through
all
your
his
eye
and
you
were
moved
yet
knew
not
how
or
why
let
him
but
rise
you
felt
the
air
was
stirred
by
an
electric
current
this
strange
force
is
mightier
than
genius
rightly
used
it
leads
to
grand
achievements
all
things
yield
before
its
mystic
presence
and
its
field
is
broad
as
earth
and
heaven
but
abused
it
sweeps
like
a
poison
simoon
on
its
course
bearing
miasma
in
its
scorching
breath
and
leaving
all
it
touches
struck
with
death
science
shall
yet
tear
away
the
mystic
garb
that
hides
it
from
the
day
and
drag
it
forth
and
bind
it
with
its
laws
and
make
it
serve
the
purposes
of
men
guided
by
and
reason
then
hear
no
more
of
séance
and
all
that
trash
which
the
world
is
gaping
lost
in
effect
while
science
seeks
the
cause
vivian
was
not
conscious
of
his
power
or
if
he
was
knew
not
its
full
extent
he
knew
his
glance
would
make
a
wild
beast
cower
and
yet
he
knew
not
that
his
large
eyes
sent
into
the
heart
of
woman
the
same
thrill
that
made
the
lion
servant
of
his
will
and
even
strong
men
felt
it
he
arose
reached
forth
his
hand
and
in
it
clasped
my
own
while
i
held
and
he
spoke
some
word
of
pleasant
greeting
in
his
low
round
tone
unlike
all
other
voices
i
have
heard
just
as
the
white
cloud
at
the
sunrise
glows
with
roseate
colours
so
the
pallid
hue
of
cheek
like
tinted
grew
through
mine
his
hand
caused
hers
to
tremble
such
was
the
magic
of
his
touch
then
we
sat
down
and
talked
about
the
weather
the
last
new
book
but
when
i
could
i
left
the
two
together
to
make
acquaintance
saying
i
must
look
after
the
especial
care
and
ran
away
and
left
them
laughing
there
through
clover
to
the
poplar
grove
i
waded
where
my
pets
were
wont
to
rove
and
there
i
found
the
foolish
mother
hen
brooding
her
chickens
underneath
a
tree
an
easy
prey
for
foxes
quoth
i
while
reaching
for
the
downy
things
that
chirping
peeped
from
out
the
very
human
is
your
folly
when
there
waits
a
haven
pleasant
bright
and
warm
and
one
to
lead
you
thither
from
the
storm
and
lurking
dangers
yet
you
turn
away
and
thinking
to
be
your
own
protector
stray
into
the
open
jaws
of
death
for
see
an
owl
is
sitting
in
this
very
tree
you
thought
safe
shelter
go
now
to
your
and
followed
by
the
clucking
clamorous
hen
so
like
the
human
mother
here
again
moaning
because
a
strong
protecting
arm
would
shield
her
little
ones
from
cold
and
harm
i
carried
back
my
garden
hat
brimful
of
chirping
chickens
like
white
balls
of
wool
and
snugly
housed
them
and
just
then
i
heard
a
sound
like
gentle
winds
among
the
trees
or
pleasant
waters
in
the
summer
stirred
and
set
in
motion
by
a
passing
breeze
helen
singing
and
as
i
drew
near
another
voice
a
tenor
full
and
clear
mingled
with
hers
as
murmuring
streams
unite
and
flow
on
stronger
in
their
wedded
might
it
was
a
way
of
not
to
sing
the
songs
that
other
people
sang
she
took
sometimes
an
extract
from
an
ancient
book
again
some
floating
fragmentary
thing
and
such
she
fitted
to
old
melodies
or
else
composed
the
music
one
of
these
she
sang
that
night
and
vivian
caught
the
strain
and
joined
her
in
the
chorus
or
refrain
song
oh
thou
mine
other
stronger
part
whom
yet
i
can
not
hear
or
see
come
thou
and
take
this
loving
heart
that
longs
to
yield
its
all
to
thee
i
call
mine
come
to
me
love
answer
back
i
come
to
thee
i
come
to
thee
this
hungry
heart
so
warm
so
large
is
far
too
great
a
care
for
me
i
have
grown
weary
of
the
charge
i
keep
so
sacredly
for
thee
come
thou
and
take
my
heart
from
me
love
answer
back
i
come
to
thee
i
come
to
thee
i
am
waiting
here
for
one
who
tarries
long
from
me
oh
art
thou
far
or
art
thou
near
and
must
i
still
be
sad
for
thee
or
wilt
thou
straightway
come
to
me
love
answer
i
am
near
to
thee
i
come
to
thee
the
melody
so
full
of
plaintive
chords
sobbed
into
down
the
strings
like
voice
of
one
who
walks
from
us
and
sings
vivian
had
leaned
upon
the
instrument
the
while
they
sang
but
as
he
spoke
those
words
i
am
near
to
thee
i
come
to
thee
he
turned
his
grand
head
slowly
round
and
bent
his
lustrous
soulful
speaking
gaze
on
me
and
my
young
heart
eager
to
own
its
king
sent
to
my
eyes
a
great
glad
trustful
light
of
love
and
faith
and
hung
upon
my
cheek
flag
there
was
no
need
to
speak
i
crossed
the
room
and
knelt
by
helen
that
song
you
sang
a
fragment
of
one
night
out
on
the
porch
beginning
me
not
i
whispered
and
her
sweet
and
plaintive
tone
rose
low
and
tender
as
if
she
had
caught
from
some
sad
passing
breeze
and
made
her
own
the
echo
of
the
sighing
strain
or
the
soft
music
of
the
falling
rain
song
o
praise
me
not
with
your
lips
dear
one
though
your
tender
words
i
prize
but
dearer
by
far
is
the
soulful
gaze
of
your
eyes
your
beautiful
eyes
your
tender
loving
eyes
o
chide
me
not
with
your
lips
dear
one
though
i
cause
your
bosom
sighs
you
can
make
repentance
deeper
far
by
your
sad
reproving
eyes
your
sorrowful
troubled
eyes
words
at
the
best
are
but
hollow
sounds
above
in
the
beaming
skies
the
constant
stars
say
never
a
word
but
only
smile
with
their
smile
on
with
their
lustrous
eyes
then
breathe
no
vow
with
your
lips
dear
one
on
the
wingèd
wind
speech
flies
but
i
read
the
truth
of
your
noble
heart
in
your
soulful
speaking
in
your
deep
and
beautiful
eyes
the
twilight
darkened
round
us
in
the
room
while
helen
sang
and
in
the
gathering
gloom
vivian
reached
out
and
took
my
hand
in
his
and
held
it
so
while
helen
made
the
air
languid
with
music
then
a
step
drew
near
and
voice
of
aunt
ruth
broke
the
spell
dear
why
maurie
helen
children
how
is
this
i
hear
you
but
you
have
no
light
in
there
your
room
is
dark
as
egypt
what
a
way
for
folks
to
visit
maurie
go
i
pray
and
order
and
so
there
came
a
light
and
all
the
sweet
dreams
hovering
around
the
twilight
shadows
flitted
in
affright
and
the
music
had
a
harsher
sound
in
pleasant
converse
passed
an
hour
away
and
vivian
planned
a
picnic
for
next
a
drive
the
next
and
rambles
without
end
that
he
might
help
me
entertain
my
friend
and
then
he
rose
bowed
low
and
passed
from
sight
like
some
great
star
that
drops
out
from
the
night
and
helen
watched
him
through
the
shadows
go
and
turned
and
said
her
voice
subdued
and
low
tall
he
is
in
all
my
life
maurine
a
grander
man
i
never
yet
have
part
iii
one
golden
of
a
checkered
year
one
summer
month
of
sunlight
moonlight
mirth
with
not
a
hint
of
shadows
lurking
near
or
brewing
a
royal
day
voluptuous
july
held
her
lover
earth
with
her
warm
arms
upon
her
glowing
breast
and
twined
herself
about
him
as
he
lay
smiling
and
panting
in
his
rest
she
bound
him
with
her
limbs
of
perfect
grace
and
hid
him
with
her
trailing
robe
of
green
and
wound
him
in
her
long
shimmering
sheen
and
rained
her
ardent
kisses
on
his
face
through
the
glad
glory
of
the
summer
land
helen
and
i
went
wandering
hand
in
hand
in
winding
paths
hard
by
the
ripe
white
with
the
promise
of
a
bounteous
yield
across
the
late
shorn
the
hill
red
with
the
blossoms
till
we
stood
upon
the
borders
of
the
lake
that
like
a
pretty
placid
infant
slept
low
at
its
base
and
little
ripples
crept
along
its
surface
just
as
dimples
chase
each
other
an
sleeping
face
helen
in
idle
hours
had
learned
to
make
a
thousand
pretty
feminine
for
brackets
ottomans
and
toilet
labour
just
suited
to
her
dainty
hands
that
morning
she
had
been
at
work
in
wax
moulding
a
wreath
of
flowers
for
my
room
taking
her
patterns
from
the
living
blows
in
all
their
dewy
beauty
and
sweet
bloom
fresh
from
my
garden
fuchsia
tulip
rose
and
trailing
ivy
grew
beneath
her
touch
resembling
the
living
plants
as
much
as
life
is
copied
in
the
form
of
death
these
lacking
but
the
perfume
and
that
breath
and
now
the
wreath
was
all
completed
save
the
mermaid
blossom
of
all
flowerdom
a
dripping
from
the
wave
and
in
search
of
it
that
we
had
come
down
to
the
lake
and
wandered
on
the
beach
to
see
if
any
lilies
grew
in
reach
some
broken
stalks
where
flowers
late
had
been
some
buds
with
all
their
beauties
folded
in
we
found
but
not
the
treasure
that
we
sought
and
then
we
turned
our
footsteps
to
the
spot
where
all
impatient
of
its
chain
my
boat
the
rocked
asking
to
be
set
afloat
it
was
a
dainty
yet
light
each
side
a
swan
was
painted
snowy
white
a
present
from
my
uncle
just
before
he
sailed
with
death
to
that
mysterious
strand
where
freighted
ships
go
sailing
evermore
but
none
return
to
tell
us
of
the
land
i
freed
the
and
slowly
rowed
about
wherever
grass
or
green
leaves
lifted
their
tips
above
the
water
so
we
drifted
while
helen
opposite
leaned
idly
out
and
watched
for
lilies
in
the
waves
below
and
softly
crooned
some
sweet
and
dreamy
air
that
soothed
me
like
a
lullabies
i
dropped
the
oars
and
closed
my
eyes
and
let
the
boat
go
drifting
here
and
there
oh
happy
day
the
last
of
that
brief
time
of
thoughtless
youth
when
all
the
world
seems
bright
ere
that
disguisèd
angel
men
call
woe
leads
the
sad
heart
through
valleys
dark
as
night
up
to
the
heights
exalted
and
sublime
on
each
blest
happy
moment
i
am
fain
to
linger
long
ere
i
pass
on
to
pain
and
sorrow
that
succeeded
from
as
golden
as
the
summer
beams
i
was
awakened
by
a
voice
that
cried
ship
ahoy
fair
frigate
whither
bound
and
starting
up
i
cast
my
gaze
around
and
saw
a
the
water
glide
close
to
the
like
some
live
thing
of
grace
and
from
it
looked
the
glowing
handsome
face
of
vivian
sirens
of
the
sea
come
sail
across
the
raging
main
with
me
he
laughed
and
leaning
drew
our
drifting
boat
beside
his
own
now
step
in
he
said
land
you
anywhere
you
want
to
my
boat
is
safer
far
than
yours
i
know
and
much
more
pleasant
with
its
sails
all
spread
the
take
the
oars
and
let
it
float
ashore
at
leisure
you
maurine
sit
miss
helen
here
ye
gods
and
little
fishes
reached
the
height
of
pleasure
and
my
wishes
adieu
despondency
farewell
to
care
done
so
quickly
that
was
way
he
did
not
wait
for
either
yea
or
nay
he
gave
commands
and
left
you
with
no
choice
but
just
to
do
the
bidding
of
his
voice
his
rare
kind
smile
low
tones
and
manly
face
lent
to
his
quick
imperiousness
a
grace
and
winning
charm
completely
stripping
it
of
what
might
otherwise
have
seemed
unfit
leaving
no
trace
of
tyranny
but
just
that
nameless
force
that
seemed
to
say
suiting
its
pretty
title
of
the
so
named
he
said
that
it
might
rhyme
with
was
carpeted
with
blue
while
all
its
sails
were
of
a
pale
rose
hue
the
daintiest
craft
that
flirted
with
the
breeze
a
fancy
in
an
hour
of
ease
whatever
vivian
had
was
of
the
best
his
room
was
like
some
in
the
east
his
board
was
always
spread
as
for
a
feast
whereat
each
meal
he
was
both
host
and
guest
he
would
go
hungry
sooner
than
dine
at
his
own
table
if
illy
set
he
so
loved
things
artistic
in
order
and
beauty
all
about
him
yet
so
kind
he
was
if
it
befell
his
lot
to
dine
within
the
humble
cot
he
made
it
seem
his
native
soil
to
be
and
thus
displayed
the
true
gentility
under
the
rosy
banners
of
the
around
the
lake
we
drifted
on
and
on
it
was
a
time
for
dreams
and
not
for
speech
and
so
we
floated
on
in
silence
each
weaving
the
fancies
suiting
such
a
day
helen
leaned
idly
the
side
and
dipped
her
rosy
fingers
in
the
tide
and
i
among
the
cushions
half
reclined
half
sat
and
watched
the
fleecy
clouds
at
play
while
vivian
with
his
opposite
in
which
he
seemed
to
either
sketch
or
write
was
lost
in
inspiration
of
some
kind
no
time
no
change
no
scene
can
efface
my
impression
of
that
hour
and
place
it
stands
out
like
a
picture
the
years
black
with
their
robes
of
with
tears
lying
with
all
their
lengthened
shapes
between
untouched
undimmed
i
still
behold
that
scene
just
as
the
last
of
days
replete
with
sunlight
crowned
with
amber
haze
followed
by
dark
and
desolate
december
through
all
the
months
of
winter
we
remember
the
sun
slipped
westward
that
peculiar
change
which
creeps
into
the
air
and
speaks
of
night
while
yet
the
day
is
full
of
golden
light
we
felt
steal
us
vivian
broke
the
spell
of
silence
throwing
down
his
book
ladies
please
allow
me
to
arrange
these
wraps
about
your
shoulders
i
know
well
the
fickle
nature
of
our
atmosphere
her
smile
swift
followed
by
a
frown
or
tear
and
go
prepared
for
changes
now
you
look
a
pretty
simile
had
you
a
pocket
mirror
here
see
how
well
my
native
talent
is
displayed
in
shawling
you
red
on
the
brunette
maid
blue
on
the
quite
without
design
oh
where
that
comparison
of
mine
a
june
rose
and
a
violet
blue
in
one
bouquet
i
fancy
that
will
do
and
now
i
crave
your
patience
and
a
boon
which
is
to
listen
while
i
read
my
rhyme
a
floating
fancy
of
the
summer
time
neither
witty
wonderful
nor
wise
so
listen
criticise
my
maiden
effort
of
the
afternoon
all
the
ships
i
have
at
sea
should
come
home
to
me
ah
well
the
harbour
could
not
hold
so
many
sails
as
there
would
be
if
all
my
ships
came
in
from
sea
half
my
ships
came
home
from
sea
and
brought
their
precious
freight
to
me
ah
well
i
should
have
wealth
as
great
as
any
king
who
sits
in
so
rich
the
treasures
that
would
be
in
half
my
ships
now
out
at
sea
just
one
ship
i
have
at
sea
should
come
home
to
me
ah
well
the
then
might
frown
for
if
the
others
all
went
down
still
rich
and
proud
and
glad
be
if
that
one
ship
came
back
to
me
that
one
ship
went
down
at
sea
and
all
the
others
came
to
me
weighed
down
with
gems
and
wealth
untold
with
glory
honour
riches
gold
the
poorest
soul
on
earth
be
if
that
one
ship
came
not
to
me
skies
be
calm
o
winds
blow
blow
all
my
ships
safe
home
to
me
but
if
thou
sendest
some

sailing
back
send
that
skim

but
bring
my
home
to
helen
was
leaning
by
me
and
her
head
rested
against
my
shoulder
as
he
read
i
stroked
her
hair
and
watched
the
fleecy
skies
and
when
he
finished
did
not
turn
my
eyes
i
felt
too
happy
and
too
shy
to
meet
his
gaze
just
then
i
said
very
sweet
and
suits
the
day
does
it
not
helen
dear
but
helen
voiceless
did
not
seem
to
hear
strange
i
added
you
poets
sing
so
feelingly
about
the
very
thing
you
care
not
for
and
dress
up
an
ideal
so
well
it
looks
a
living
breathing
real
now
to
a
listener
your
love
song
seemed
a
yet
heard
you
say
almost
the
opposite
or
that
you
deemed
position
honour
glory
power
fame
gained
without
loss
of
conscience
or
good
name
the
things
to
live
you
well
you
may
laughed
vivian
ago
and
solomon
says
wise
men
change
you
know
i
now
speak
truth
if
she
i
hold
most
dear
slipped
from
my
life
and
no
least
hope
were
left
my
heart
would
find
the
years
more
lonely
here
than
if
i
were
of
wealth
fame
friends
bereft
and
sent
an
exile
to
a
foreign
his
voice
was
low
and
measured
as
he
spoke
new
unknown
chords
of
melody
awoke
within
my
soul
i
felt
my
heart
expand
with
that
sweet
fulness
born
of
love
i
turned
to
hide
the
blushes
on
my
cheek
that
burned
and
leaning
over
helen
breathed
her
name
she
lay
so
motionless
i
thought
she
slept
but
as
i
spoke
i
saw
her
eyes
unclose
and
her
face
a
sudden
glory
swept
and
a
slight
tremor
thrilled
all
through
her
frame
friend
i
said
face
is
full
of
light
what
were
the
dreams
that
made
your
eyes
so
bright
she
only
smiled
for
answer
and
arose
from
her
reclining
posture
at
my
side
threw
back
the
ringlets
from
her
face
with
a
quick
gesture
full
of
easy
grace
and
turning
spoke
to
vivian
you
guide
the
boat
up
near
that
little
clump
of
green
off
to
the
right
where
the
lilies
grow
we
quite
forgot
our
errand
here
maurine
and
our
few
moments
have
grown
into
hours
what
will
aunt
ruth
think
of
our
so
will
i
can
reach
the
just
hear
that
and
vivian
broke
forth
singing
brothers
the
six
ringing
who
ever
knew
three
hours
to
go
so
fast
in
all
the
annals
of
the
world
before
i
could
have
sworn
not
over
one
had
passed
young
ladies
i
am
forced
to
go
ashore
i
thank
you
for
the
pleasure
you
have
given
this
afternoon
has
been
a
glimpse
of
heaven
dreams
and
by
your
gracious
leave
pay
my
compliments
a
smile
a
bow
and
he
had
gone
his
way
and
in
the
waning
glory
of
the
day
down
cool
green
lanes
and
through
the
shadows
silent
we
wandered
back
across
the
meadows
the
wreath
was
finished
and
adorned
my
room
long
afterward
the
copied
bloom
was
like
a
horrid
spectre
in
my
sight
staring
upon
me
morning
noon
and
night
the
sun
went
down
the
sad
new
moon
rose
up
and
passed
before
me
like
an
empty
cup
the
great
unseen
brims
full
of
pain
or
bliss
and
gives
his
children
saying
of
a
light
wind
from
the
open
casement
fanned
my
brow
and
as
we
hand
in
hand
sat
looking
out
upon
the
twilight
scene
in
dreamy
silence
eyes
like
two
lost
stars
that
wandered
from
the
skies
some
night
adown
the
shining
track
and
always
had
been
grieving
to
go
back
now
gazed
up
wistfully
at
dome
and
seemed
to
recognise
and
long
for
home
her
sweet
voice
broke
the
silence
maurine
before
you
speak
you
know
the
moon
is
new
and
anything
you
wish
for
will
come
true
before
it
wanes
i
do
believe
the
sign
now
tell
me
your
wish
and
tell
you
i
turned
and
looked
up
at
the
slim
young
moon
and
with
an
almost
superstitious
heart
i
sighed
new
moon
help
me
by
thine
art
to
grow
all
grace
and
goodness
and
to
be
worthy
the
love
a
true
heart
proffers
then
smiling
down
i
said
one
my
boon
i
fear
is
quite
too
silly
or
too
sweet
for
my
repeating
so
let
it
stay
between
the
moon
and
me
but
if
i
may
listen
now
to
your
wish
tell
me
please
all
suddenly
she
nestled
at
my
feet
and
hid
her
blushing
face
upon
my
knees
then
drew
my
hand
against
her
glowing
cheek
and
leaning
on
my
breast
began
to
speak
half
sighing
out
the
words
my
tortured
ear
reached
down
to
catch
while
striving
not
to
hear
you
not
guess
who
about
maurine
oh
my
sweet
friend
you
must
ere
this
have
seen
the
love
i
tried
to
cover
from
all
eyes
and
from
myself
ah
foolish
little
heart
as
well
it
might
go
seeking
for
some
art
whereby
to
hide
the
sun
in
noonday
skies
when
first
the
strange
sound
of
his
voice
i
heard
looked
on
his
noble
face
and
touched
his
hand
my
heart
thrilled
through
and
through
and
stirred
as
if
to
say
hear
and
and
day
by
day
mine
eyes
were
blest
beholding
the
inner
beauty
of
his
life
unfolding
in
countless
words
and
actions
that
portrayed
the
noble
stuff
of
which
his
soul
was
made
and
more
and
more
i
felt
my
heart
upreaching
toward
the
truth
drawn
gently
by
his
teaching
as
flowers
are
drawn
by
sunlight
and
there
grew
a
strange
shy
something
in
its
depths
i
knew
at
length
was
love
because
it
was
so
sad
and
yet
so
sweet
and
made
my
heart
so
glad
yet
seemed
to
pain
me
then
for
very
shame
lest
all
should
read
my
secret
and
its
name
i
strove
to
hide
it
in
my
breast
away
where
god
could
see
it
only
but
each
day
it
seemed
to
grow
within
me
and
would
rise
like
my
own
soul
and
look
forth
from
my
eyes
defying
bonds
of
silence
and
would
speak
in
its
language
on
my
cheek
if
but
his
name
was
uttered
you
were
kind
my
own
maurine
as
you
alone
could
be
so
long
the
sharer
of
my
heart
and
mind
while
yet
you
saw
in
seeming
not
to
see
in
all
the
years
we
have
been
friends
my
own
and
loved
as
women
very
rarely
do
my
heart
no
sorrow
and
no
joy
has
known
it
has
not
shared
at
once
in
full
with
you
and
i
so
longed
to
speak
to
you
of
this
when
first
i
felt
its
mingled
pain
and
bliss
yet
dared
not
lest
you
knowing
him
should
say
in
pity
for
my
you
are
undone
because
no
mortal
art
can
win
the
love
of
such
a
lofty
and
so
i
waited
silent
and
in
pain
till
i
could
know
i
did
not
love
in
vain
and
now
i
know
beyond
a
doubt
or
fear
did
he
not
say
she
i
hold
most
dear
slipped
from
my
life
and
no
least
hope
were
left
my
heart
would
find
the
years
more
lonely
here
than
if
i
were
of
wealth
fame
friends
bereft
and
sent
an
exile
to
a
foreign
oh
darling
you
must
to
understand
the
joy
that
thrilled
all
through
me
at
those
words
it
was
as
if
a
thousand
singing
birds
within
my
heart
broke
forth
in
notes
of
praise
i
did
not
look
up
but
i
knew
his
gaze
was
on
my
face
and
that
his
eyes
must
see
the
joy
i
felt
almost
transfigured
me
he
loves
me
so
the
birds
kept
singing
and
all
my
soul
with
that
sweet
strain
is
ringing
if
there
were
added
but
one
drop
of
bliss
no
more
my
cup
would
hold
and
so
this
eve
i
made
a
wish
that
i
might
feel
his
kiss
upon
my
lips
ere
yon
pale
moon
should
leave
the
stars
all
lonely
having
waned
away
too
old
and
weak
and
bowed
with
care
to
her
voice
sighed
in
silence
while
she
spoke
my
heart
writhed
in
me
praying
she
would
each
word
she
uttered
falling
like
a
stroke
on
my
bare
soul
and
now
a
hush
like
death
save
that
broken
by
a
breath
fell
me
but
brought
not
the
peace
for
when
the
lash
no
longer
leaves
its
blows
the
flesh
still
quivers
and
the
blood
still
flows
she
nestled
on
my
bosom
like
a
child
and
her
head
my
tortured
heart
throbbed
wild
with
pain
and
pity
she
had
told
her
her
story
to
the
end
how
could
i
look
down
on
her
as
she
lay
so
fair
and
sweet
and
and
a
tender
blossom
on
my
breast
and
say
you
are
do
mistake
dear
friend
i
am
loved
not
yet
that
were
truth
and
she
must
know
it
later
should
i
speak
and
spread
a
ghastly
pallor
the
cheek
flushed
now
with
joy
and
while
i
doubting
pondered
she
spoke
again
i
oft
have
wondered
why
you
and
vivian
were
not
lovers
he
is
all
a
heart
could
ask
its
king
to
be
and
you
have
beauty
intellect
and
youth
i
think
it
strange
you
have
not
loved
each
strange
how
he
could
pass
by
you
for
another
not
half
so
fair
or
worthy
yet
i
know
a
loving
father
it
so
i
think
my
heart
has
known
him
all
these
years
and
waited
for
him
and
if
when
he
came
it
had
been
as
a
lover
of
my
friend
i
should
have
recognised
him
all
the
same
as
my
and
loved
him
to
the
end
hiding
my
grief
and
forcing
back
my
tears
till
on
my
heart
slow
dropping
day
by
day
unseen
they
fell
and
wore
it
all
away
and
so
a
tender
father
kept
him
free
with
all
the
largeness
of
his
love
for
for
me
unworthy
such
a
precious
gift
yet
i
will
bend
each
effort
of
my
life
to
grow
in
grace
and
goodness
and
to
lift
my
soul
and
spirit
to
his
lofty
height
so
to
deserve
that
holy
name
his
wife
sweet
friend
it
fills
my
whole
heart
with
delight
to
breathe
its
long
hid
secret
in
your
ear
speak
my
maurine
and
say
you
love
to
hear
the
while
she
spoke
my
active
brain
gave
rise
to
one
great
thought
of
mighty
sacrifice
and
oh
it
blanched
my
cheek
and
wrung
my
soul
and
from
my
heart
it
drove
all
life
and
feeling
i
strove
to
send
it
from
me
but
i
felt
it
cling
and
hold
fast
on
my
mind
like
some
live
thing
and
all
the
self
within
me
felt
its
touch
and
cried
no
i
can
not
do
so
i
am
not
strong
is
no
and
then
the
voice
of
helen
bade
me
speak
and
with
a
calmness
born
of
nerve
i
said
scarce
knowing
what
i
uttered
all
your
joys
and
sorrows
are
with
mine
own
wed
i
thank
you
for
your
confidence
and
pray
i
may
deserve
it
always
but
dear
one
our
in
the
has
set
my
head
to
aching
i
must
go
to
bed
directly
and
you
will
i
know
grant
me
your
pardon
and
another
day
talk
of
this
together
now
and
angels
guard
you
with
their
wings
of
i
kissed
her
lips
and
held
her
on
my
heart
and
viewed
her
as
i
had
done
before
i
gazed
upon
her
features
and
marked
her
white
tender
fragile
form
like
some
frail
plant
that
withers
in
the
storm
saw
she
was
fairer
in
her
joy
than
before
and
thought
i
destroy
handiwork
or
leave
it
at
the
best
a
broken
harp
while
i
close
clasp
my
bliss
i
bent
my
head
and
gave
her
one
last
kiss
and
sought
my
room
and
found
there
such
relief
as
sad
hearts
feel
when
first
alone
with
grief
the
moon
went
down
slow
sailing
from
my
sight
and
left
the
stars
to
watch
away
the
night
o
stars
sweet
stars
so
changeless
and
serene
what
depths
of
woe
your
pitying
eyes
have
seen
the
proud
sun
sets
and
leaves
us
with
our
sorrow
to
grope
alone
in
darkness
till
the
morrow
the
languid
moon
if
she
deigns
to
rise
soon
seeks
her
couch
grown
weary
of
our
sighs
but
from
the
early
gloaming
till
the
day
sends
heralds
forth
to
say
he
comes
in
might
the
patient
stars
shine
on
steadfast
and
faithful
from
twilight
to
dawn
and
as
they
shone
upon
gethsemane
and
watched
the
struggle
of
a
soul
now
from
the
same
far
height
they
shone
on
me
and
saw
the
waves
of
anguish
me
roll
the
storm
had
come
upon
me
all
unseen
no
sound
of
thunder
fell
upon
my
ear
no
cloud
arose
to
tell
me
it
was
near
but
under
skies
all
sunlit
and
serene
i
floated
with
the
current
of
the
stream
and
thought
life
all
one
dream
when
lo
a
hurricane
with
awful
force
swept
swift
upon
its
devastating
course
wrecked
my
frail
bark
and
cast
me
on
the
wave
where
all
my
hopes
had
found
a
sudden
grave
love
makes
us
blind
and
selfish
otherwise
i
had
seen
secret
in
her
eyes
so
used
i
was
to
reading
every
look
in
her
sweet
face
as
i
would
read
a
book
but
now
made
sightless
by
blinding
rays
i
had
gone
on
unseeing
to
the
end
where
pain
dispelled
the
mist
of
golden
haze
that
walled
me
in
and
lo
i
found
my
friend
who
journeyed
with
my
very
had
been
sore
wounded
to
the
heart
while
i
both
deaf
and
blind
saw
not
nor
heard
her
cry
and
then
i
sobbed
god
i
would
have
died
to
save
her
and
as
i
cried
in
pain
there
leaped
forth
from
the
still
white
realm
of
thought
where
conscience
dwells
that
unimpassioned
spot
as
widely
different
from
the
domain
as
north
from
impulse
felt
before
and
put
away
but
now
it
rose
once
more
in
greater
strength
and
said
wouldst
thou
prove
what
lips
have
uttered
then
go
lay
thy
love
on
altar
as
thy
cried
my
heart
any
other
ask
life
easier
sacrifice
but
ask
not
love
for
that
i
can
not
spoke
the
voice
meanest
insect
dies
and
is
no
hero
heroes
dare
to
live
when
all
that
makes
life
sweet
is
snatched
so
with
my
heart
in
converse
till
the
day
in
gold
and
crimson
billows
rose
and
broke
the
voice
of
conscience
all
unwearied
spoke
love
warred
with
friendship
heart
with
conscience
fought
hours
rolled
away
and
yet
the
end
was
not
and
wily
self
tricked
out
like
tenderness
sighed
how
one
whose
life
thou
wert
to
bless
will
be
cast
down
and
grope
in
doubt
and
fear
wouldst
thou
wound
him
to
give
thy
friend
relief
can
wrong
make
right
conscience
said
pride
and
time
can
heal
the
saddest
hurts
of
love
while
wounds
gape
wide
and
yet
more
wide
and
bitter
fountains
of
the
spirit
at
length
exhausted
with
the
wearing
strife
i
cast
the
burden
of
my
life
on
broad
breast
and
sought
that
deep
repose
that
only
he
who
watched
with
sorrow
knows
part
iv
maurine
ten
arise
my
pretty
sluggard
open
those
dark
eyes
and
see
where
yonder
sun
is
do
you
know
i
made
my
toilet
just
four
hours
ago
voice
and
gentle
kiss
fell
on
my
cheek
as
from
a
deep
abyss
i
drew
my
weary
self
from
that
strange
sleep
that
rests
not
nor
refreshes
scarce
awake
or
conscious
yet
there
seemed
a
heavy
weight
bound
on
my
breast
as
by
a
cruel
fate
i
knew
not
why
and
yet
i
longed
to
weep
some
dark
cloud
seemed
to
hang
upon
the
day
and
for
a
moment
in
that
trance
i
lay
when
suddenly
the
truth
did
me
break
like
some
great
wave
upon
a
helpless
child
the
dull
pain
in
my
breast
grew
like
a
the
heavy
throbbing
of
my
heart
grew
wild
and
god
gave
back
the
burden
of
the
life
he
kept
what
time
i
slumbered
are
ill
cried
helen
that
blinding
headache
still
you
look
so
pale
and
weary
now
let
me
play
nurse
maurine
and
care
for
you
and
first
suit
some
dainty
to
your
taste
and
bring
it
to
you
with
a
cup
of
and
off
she
ran
not
waiting
my
reply
but
wanting
most
the
sunshine
and
the
light
i
left
my
couch
and
clothed
myself
in
haste
and
kneeling
sent
to
god
an
earnest
cry
for
help
and
guidance
thou
me
the
way
where
duty
leads
for
i
am
blind
my
sight
obscured
by
self
oh
lead
my
steps
aright
help
me
see
the
path
and
if
it
may
let
this
cup
pass
yet
thou
heavenly
one
thy
will
in
all
things
not
mine
own
be
rising
i
went
upon
my
way
receiving
the
strength
prayer
gives
alway
to
hearts
believing
i
felt
that
unseen
hands
were
leading
me
and
knew
the
end
was
peace
are
you
up
cried
helen
coming
with
a
tray
and
cup
of
tender
toast
and
fragrant
smoking
tea
naughty
girl
you
should
have
stayed
in
bed
until
you
ate
your
breakfast
and
were
better
something
hidden
for
you
letter
but
drink
your
tea
before
you
read
it
dear
from
some
distant
cousin
auntie
said
and
so
you
need
not
hurry
now
be
good
and
mind
your
so
in
passive
mood
i
laid
the
still
unopened
letter
near
and
loitered
at
my
breakfast
more
to
please
my
nurse
than
any
hunger
to
appease
then
listlessly
i
broke
the
seal
and
read
the
few
lines
written
in
a
bold
free
hand
london
canada
dear
coz
maurine
in
spite
of
generations
stretched
between
our
natural
right
to
that
most
handy
claim
of
cousinship
use
it
all
the
same
coming
to
see
you
honestly
in
truth
threatened
i
mean
to
act
find
my
coming
is
a
stubborn
fact
keep
quiet
though
and
do
not
tell
aunt
ruth
i
wonder
if
know
her
petted
boy
in
spite
of
changes
look
for
me
until
you
see
me
coming
as
of
old
still
your
faithful
friend
and
loving
cousin
so
roy
was
coming
he
and
i
had
played
as
boy
and
girl
and
later
youth
and
maid
full
half
our
lives
together
he
had
been
like
me
an
orphan
and
the
roof
of
kin
gave
both
kind
shelter
swift
years
sped
away
ere
change
was
felt
and
then
one
summer
day
a
uncle
sailed
from
made
roy
his
heir
and
he
was
ours
no
more
write
us
daily
and
see
his
face
once
every
such
was
his
promise
given
the
morn
he
left
but
now
the
years
were
seven
since
last
he
looked
upon
the
olden
place
been
through
college
travelled
in
all
lands
sailed
over
seas
and
trod
the
desert
sands
would
write
and
plan
a
visit
then
ere
long
would
write
again
from
egypt
or
hong
some
fancy
called
him
thither
unforeseen
so
years
had
passed
till
seven
lay
between
his
going
and
the
coming
of
this
note
which
i
hid
in
my
bosom
and
replied
to
aunt
queries
the
truant
wrote
by
saying
he
was
still
upon
the
wing
and
merely
dropped
a
line
while
journeying
to
say
he
lived
and
she
was
satisfied
sometimes
it
happens
in
this
world
so
strange
a
human
heart
will
pass
through
mortal
strife
and
writhe
in
torture
while
the
old
sweet
life
so
full
of
hope
and
beauty
bloom
and
grace
is
slowly
strangled
by
remorseless
pain
and
one
stern
cold
relentless
takes
its
a
ghastly
pallid
spectre
of
the
slain
yet
those
in
daily
converse
see
no
change
nor
dream
the
heart
has
suffered
so
that
day
i
passed
along
toward
the
troubled
way
stern
duty
pointed
and
no
mortal
guessed
a
mighty
conflict
had
disturbed
my
breast
i
had
resolved
to
yield
up
to
my
friend
the
man
i
loved
since
she
too
loved
him
so
i
saw
no
other
way
in
honour
left
she
was
so
weak
and
fragile
once
bereft
of
this
great
hope
that
held
her
with
such
power
she
would
wilt
down
like
some
flower
and
swift
untimely
death
would
be
the
end
but
i
was
strong
and
hardy
plants
which
grow
in
soil
can
bear
bleak
winds
that
blow
from
arctic
lands
whereof
a
single
breath
would
lay
the
blossom
low
in
death
the
hours
went
by
too
slow
and
yet
too
fast
all
day
i
argued
with
my
foolish
heart
that
bade
me
play
the
shrinking
part
and
hide
from
pain
and
when
the
day
had
past
and
time
for
call
drew
near
and
nearer
it
pleaded
until
the
way
seems
clearer
say
you
are
busy
keep
away
until
you
gather
strength
enough
to
play
the
part
you
have
resolved
not
so
made
answer
reason
you
go
and
put
your
resolution
to
the
test
resolve
however
nobly
formed
at
best
is
but
a
babe
of
thought
until
it
proves
existence
of
its
life
and
will
by
sound
or
so
when
helen
came
and
knelt
by
me
her
fair
face
all
aflame
with
sudden
blushes
whispering
sweet
my
heart
can
hear
the
music
of
his
feet
go
down
with
me
to
meet
him
i
arose
and
went
with
her
all
calmly
as
one
goes
to
look
upon
the
dear
face
of
the
dead
that
eve
i
know
not
what
i
did
or
said
i
was
not
manner
was
not
strange
perchance
i
talked
more
freely
than
my
wont
but
in
my
speech
was
naught
could
give
affront
yet
i
conveyed
as
only
woman
can
that
nameless
which
bespeaks
a
change
in
the
power
of
woman
if
she
be
and
noble
free
from
her
motives
all
unselfish
worthy
good
to
make
herself
and
feelings
understood
by
nameless
acts
thus
sparing
what
to
man
however
gently
answered
causes
pain
the
offering
of
his
hand
and
heart
in
vain
she
can
be
friendly
unrestrained
and
kind
assume
no
airs
of
pride
or
arrogance
but
in
her
voice
her
manner
and
her
glance
convey
that
mystic
something
undefined
which
men
fail
not
to
understand
and
read
and
when
not
blind
with
egoism
heed
my
task
was
the
slow
undoing
of
long
sweet
months
of
unimpeded
wooing
it
was
to
hide
and
cover
and
conceal
the
truth
assuming
what
i
did
not
feel
it
was
to
dam
happy
singing
tide
that
blessed
me
with
its
hopeful
tuneful
tone
by
feigned
till
it
turned
aside
and
changed
its
channel
leaving
me
alone
to
walk
parched
plains
and
thirst
for
that
sweet
draught
my
lips
had
tasted
but
another
quaffed
it
could
be
done
for
no
words
yet
were
none
to
pledges
to
be
broken
will
be
grieved
then
angry
cold
then
cross
i
reasoned
thinking
what
would
be
his
part
in
this
strange
drama
because
he
feels
something
lacking
to
make
good
his
loss
turn
to
helen
and
her
gentle
grace
and
loving
acts
will
win
her
soon
the
place
i
hold
and
like
a
troubled
dream
at
length
our
past
when
he
looks
back
will
that
evening
passed
with
music
chat
and
song
but
hours
that
once
had
flown
on
airy
wings
now
limped
on
weary
aching
limbs
along
each
moment
like
some
dreaded
step
that
brings
a
twinge
of
pain
as
vivian
rose
to
go
slow
bending
to
me
from
his
greater
height
he
took
my
hand
and
looking
in
my
eyes
with
tender
questioning
and
pained
surprise
said
you
are
not
yourself
what
is
it
are
you
ailing
no
i
answered
laughing
lightly
am
not
just
see
my
cheek
it
thin
or
pale
now
tell
me
am
i
looking
very
frail
nay
he
answered
can
not
be
the
change
i
speak
more
in
your
preoccupation
know
not
what
miss
helen
am
i
wrong
or
does
maurine
seem
to
have
something
on
her
mind
this
eve
does
laughed
helen
i
do
believe
i
know
what
a
letter
came
which
she
read
slyly
and
then
hid
away
close
to
her
heart
not
knowing
i
was
near
and
since
been
as
you
have
seen
her
here
see
how
she
blushes
so
my
random
shot
we
must
believe
has
struck
a
tender
her
rippling
laughter
floated
through
the
room
and
redder
yet
i
felt
the
hot
blood
rise
then
surge
away
to
leave
me
pale
as
death
under
the
dark
and
swiftly
gathering
gloom
of
questioning
accusing
eyes
that
searched
my
soul
i
almost
shrieked
beneath
that
stern
fixed
gaze
and
stood
spellbound
until
he
turned
with
sudden
movement
gave
his
hand
to
each
in
turn
and
said
must
not
stand
longer
young
ladies
in
this
open
door
the
air
is
heavy
with
a
cold
damp
chill
we
shall
have
rain
or
before
he
vanished
in
the
darkling
shade
and
so
the
dreaded
evening
found
an
end
that
saw
me
grasp
the
blade
and
strike
a
blow
for
honour
and
for
friend
swiftly
passed
the
evening
helen
sighed
long
the
hours
my
tortured
heart
replied
joy
like
a
child
with
lightsome
steps
doth
glide
by
father
time
and
looking
in
his
face
cries
snatching
blossoms
from
the
fair
roadside
could
pluck
more
but
for
thy
hurried
the
while
her
elder
brother
pain
man
grown
whose
feet
are
hurt
by
many
a
thorn
and
stone
looks
to
some
distant
hilltop
high
and
calm
where
he
shall
find
not
only
rest
but
balm
for
all
his
wounds
and
cries
in
tones
of
woe
father
time
why
is
thy
pace
so
slow
two
days
all
sad
with
lonely
wind
and
rain
went
sobbing
by
repeating
and
the
miserere
desolate
and
drear
which
every
human
heart
must
sometime
hear
pain
is
but
little
varied
its
refrain
the
words
are
is
for
aye
the
same
the
third
day
brought
a
change
for
with
it
came
not
only
sunny
smiles
to
face
but
roy
our
roy
came
back
to
us
once
more
we
looked
into
his
laughing
handsome
eyes
which
while
they
gave
aunt
ruth
a
glad
surprise
in
no
way
puzzled
her
for
one
glance
told
what
each
succeeding
one
confirmed
that
he
who
bent
above
her
with
the
lissome
grace
of
his
fine
form
though
grown
so
tall
could
be
no
other
than
the
roy
montaine
of
old
it
was
a
sweet
reunion
and
he
brought
so
much
of
sunshine
with
him
that
i
caught
just
from
his
smile
alone
enough
of
gladness
to
make
my
heart
forget
a
time
its
sadness
we
talked
together
of
the
dear
old
days
leaving
the
present
with
its
depths
and
heights
of
maturer
sorrows
and
delights
i
turned
back
to
my
level
land
and
roy
and
i
dear
playmates
hand
in
hand
wandered
in
through
the
olden
ways
it
was
the
second
evening
of
his
coming
helen
was
playing
dreamily
and
humming
some
wordless
melody
of
thought
while
roy
and
i
sat
by
the
open
door
childish
incidents
of
yore
my
eyes
were
glowing
and
my
cheeks
were
hot
with
warm
young
blood
excitement
joy
or
pain
alike
would
send
swift
coursing
through
each
vein
roy
always
eloquent
was
waxing
fine
and
bringing
vividly
before
my
gaze
some
old
adventure
of
those
halcyon
days
when
suddenly
in
pauses
of
the
talk
i
heard
a
step
upon
the
walk
and
looked
up
quickly
to
meet
full
in
mine
the
eyes
of
vivian
dangerfield
a
flash
shot
from
their
depths
sudden
blaze
of
light
like
that
swift
followed
by
the
crash
which
said
is
confirmed
by
sight
as
they
fell
on
the
pleasant
doorway
scene
then
his
face
a
cold
white
look
crept
like
the
pallid
moonlight
a
brook
and
with
a
slight
proud
bending
of
the
head
he
stepped
toward
us
haughtily
and
said
pardon
my
intrusion
miss
maurine
i
called
to
ask
miss
trevor
for
a
book
she
spoke
of
lending
me
nay
sit
you
still
and
i
by
grant
of
your
permission
will
pass
by
to
where
i
hear
her
i
said
moment
vivian
if
you
please
and
suddenly
bereft
of
all
my
ease
and
scarcely
knowing
what
to
do
or
say
confused
as
any
schoolgirl
i
arose
and
some
way
made
each
to
the
other
known
they
bowed
shook
hands
then
vivian
turned
away
and
sought
out
helen
leaving
us
alone
of
miss
or
of
beaux
which
may
he
be
who
cometh
like
a
prince
with
haughty
bearing
and
an
eagle
eye
roy
queried
laughing
and
i
answered
you
saw
him
pass
me
for
miss
side
i
leave
your
own
good
judgment
to
and
straightway
caused
the
tide
of
talk
to
glide
in
other
channels
striving
to
dispel
the
sudden
gloom
that
my
spirit
fell
we
mortals
are
such
hypocrites
at
best
when
conscience
tries
our
courage
with
a
test
and
points
to
some
steep
pathway
we
set
out
boldly
denying
any
fear
or
doubt
but
pause
before
the
first
rock
in
the
way
and
looking
back
with
tears
at
conscience
say
are
so
sad
dear
conscience
for
we
would
most
gladly
do
what
to
thee
seemeth
good
but
lo
this
rock
we
can
not
climb
it
so
thou
must
point
out
some
other
way
to
yet
secretly
we
are
rejoicing
and
when
right
before
our
faces
as
we
stand
in
seeming
grief
the
rock
is
cleft
in
twain
leaving
the
pathway
clear
we
shrink
in
pain
and
loth
to
go
by
every
act
reveal
what
we
so
tried
from
conscience
to
conceal
i
saw
that
hour
the
way
made
plain
to
do
with
scarce
an
effort
what
had
seemed
a
strife
that
would
require
the
strength
of
my
whole
life
women
have
quick
perceptions
and
i
knew
that
heart
was
full
of
jealous
pain
montaine
to
be
my
lover
first
my
altered
and
next
the
the
doorway
my
flushed
face
gazing
in
the
one
above
that
bent
so
near
me
and
my
strange
confusion
when
vivian
came
all
led
to
one
conclusion
that
i
had
but
been
playing
with
his
love
as
women
sometimes
cruelly
do
play
with
hearts
when
their
true
lovers
are
away
there
could
be
nothing
easier
than
just
to
let
him
linger
on
in
this
belief
till
suspicion
and
distrust
should
turn
to
scorn
and
anger
all
his
grief
compared
with
me
so
doubly
sweet
and
pure
would
helen
seem
my
purpose
would
be
sure
and
certain
of
completion
in
the
end
but
now
the
way
was
made
so
straight
and
clear
my
coward
heart
shrank
back
in
guilty
fear
till
conscience
whispered
with
her
small
voice
precious
time
is
thy
resign
thy
love
or
slay
thy
trusting
the
growing
moon
watched
by
the
myriad
eyes
of
countless
stars
went
sailing
through
the
skies
like
some
young
prince
rising
to
rule
a
nation
to
whom
all
eyes
are
turned
in
expectation
a
woman
who
possesses
tact
and
art
and
strength
of
will
can
take
the
hand
of
doom
and
walk
on
smiling
sweetly
as
she
goes
with
rosy
lips
and
rounded
cheeks
of
bloom
cheating
a
world
that
never
knows
the
pain
and
sorrow
of
her
hidden
heart
and
so
i
joined
in
bright
changing
chat
answered
his
of
this
and
that
my
brow
unruffled
as
the
calm
still
wave
that
tells
not
of
the
wrecked
ship
and
the
grave
beneath
its
surface
then
we
heard
ere
long
the
sound
of
gentle
voice
in
song
and
rising
entered
where
the
subtle
power
of
eyes
forgiving
while
accusing
finding
me
weak
had
won
me
in
that
hour
but
roy
always
polite
and
debonair
where
ladies
were
now
hung
about
my
chair
with
nameless
delicate
attentions
using
that
air
devotional
and
those
small
arts
acquaintance
with
society
imparts
to
men
gallant
by
nature
my
sex
and
not
myself
he
bowed
to
had
my
place
been
filled
that
evening
by
a
dowager
twice
his
own
age
he
would
have
given
her
the
same
attentions
but
they
served
to
vex
whatever
hope
in
heart
remained
the
cold
white
look
crept
back
upon
his
face
which
told
how
deeply
he
was
hurt
and
pained
little
by
little
all
things
had
conspired
to
bring
events
i
dreaded
yet
desired
we
were
in
constant
intercourse
walks
rides
picnics
and
sails
filled
weeks
of
golden
weather
and
almost
hourly
we
were
thrown
together
no
words
were
spoken
of
rebuke
or
scorn
good
friends
we
seemed
but
as
a
gulf
divides
this
land
and
that
though
lying
side
by
side
so
rolled
a
gulf
between
and
the
gulf
of
doubt
which
widened
slowly
morn
and
noon
and
night
free
and
informal
were
these
picnics
and
excursions
yet
although
helen
and
i
would
sometimes
choose
to
go
without
our
escorts
leaving
them
quite
free
it
happened
alway
roy
would
seek
out
me
ere
passed
the
day
while
vivian
walked
with
her
i
had
no
thought
of
flirting
roy
was
just
like
some
dear
brother
and
i
quite
forgot
the
kinship
was
so
distant
it
was
not
safe
to
rely
upon
in
perfect
trust
without
reserve
or
caution
many
a
time
when
there
was
some
steep
to
climb
and
i
grew
weary
he
would
say
come
rest
you
and
i
would
go
and
lean
my
head
upon
his
shoulder
or
would
stand
and
let
him
hold
in
his
my
willing
hand
the
while
he
stroked
it
gently
with
his
own
or
i
would
let
him
clasp
me
with
his
arm
nor
entertained
a
thought
of
any
harm
nor
once
supposed
but
vivian
was
alone
in
his
suspicions
but
ere
long
the
truth
i
learned
in
consternation
both
aunt
ruth
and
helen
honestly
in
faith
believed
that
roy
and
i
were
lovers
undeceived
some
careless
words
might
open
eyes
and
spoil
my
plans
so
reasoning
in
this
wise
to
all
their
sallies
i
in
jest
replied
to
naught
assented
and
yet
naught
denied
with
roy
unchanged
remaining
confident
each
understood
just
what
the
other
meant
if
i
grew
weary
of
this
double
part
and
deception
caused
my
heart
sometimes
to
shrink
i
needed
but
to
gaze
on
face
that
wore
a
look
ethereal
as
if
she
dwelt
above
the
things
material
and
held
communion
with
the
angels
so
i
fed
my
strength
and
courage
through
the
days
what
time
the
harvest
moon
rose
full
and
clear
and
cast
its
radiance
on
the
earth
we
made
a
feast
and
called
from
far
and
near
our
friends
who
came
to
share
the
scene
of
mirth
fair
forms
and
faces
flitted
to
and
fro
but
none
more
sweet
than
robed
in
white
she
floated
like
a
vision
through
the
dance
so
frailly
fragile
and
so
phantom
fair
she
seemed
like
some
stray
spirit
of
the
air
and
was
pursued
by
many
an
anxious
glance
that
looked
to
see
her
fading
from
the
sight
like
figures
that
a
dreamer
sees
at
night
and
noble
men
and
gallants
graced
the
scene
yet
none
more
noble
or
more
grand
of
mien
than
of
chest
and
shoulder
tall
and
finely
formed
as
any
grecian
god
whose
foot
on
mount
olympus
trod
his
face
was
beardless
and
like
those
same
grecian
statues
when
in
calm
repose
was
it
in
hue
and
feature
framed
in
hair
dark
and
abundant
lighted
by
large
eyes
that
could
be
cold
as
steel
in
winter
air
or
warm
and
sunny
as
italian
skies
weary
of
mirth
and
music
and
the
sound
of
tripping
feet
i
sought
a
rest
within
the
where
a
group
i
found
of
guests
discussing
with
apparent
zest
some
theme
of
near
the
while
leaning
and
listening
with
his
slow
odd
smile
miss
la
pelle
we
will
appeal
to
you
cried
young
guy
semple
as
i
entered
have
been
discussing
right
before
his
face
all
unrebuked
by
him
as
you
may
see
a
poem
lately
published
by
our
friend
and
we
are
quite
divided
i
contend
the
poem
is
a
libel
and
untrue
i
hold
the
fickle
women
are
but
few
compared
with
those
who
are
like
yon
fair
moon
that
ever
faithful
rises
in
her
place
whether
greeted
by
the
flowers
of
june
or
cold
and
dreary
stretches
of
white
cried
another
dangerfield
look
to
your
laurels
or
you
needs
must
yield
the
crown
to
semple
who
very
plain
has
mounted
pegasus
and
grasped
his
all
laughed
and
then
as
guy
appealed
to
me
i
answered
lightly
young
friend
i
fear
you
chose
a
most
unlucky
simile
to
prove
the
truth
of
woman
to
her
place
the
moon
does
with
a
different
face
each
time
she
comes
but
now
i
needs
must
hear
the
poem
read
before
i
can
consent
to
pass
my
judgment
on
the
all
clamoured
that
the
author
was
the
man
to
read
the
poem
and
with
tones
that
said
more
than
the
cutting
scornful
words
he
read
taking
the
book
guy
gave
him
he
began
her
love
the
sands
upon
the
ocean
side
that
change
about
with
every
tide
and
never
true
to
one
abide
a
love
i
liken
to
the
summer
zephyrs
light
and
vain
that
sing
the
same
alluring
strain
to
every
grass
blade
on
the
a
love
is
nothing
more
the
sunshine
of
an
april
day
that
comes
to
warm
you
with
its
ray
but
while
you
smile
has
flown
a
love
is
like
to
this
god
made
poor
woman
with
no
heart
but
gave
her
skill
and
tact
and
art
and
so
she
lives
and
plays
her
part
we
must
not
blame
but
pity
her
she
leans
to
just
to
hear
the
praise
he
whispers
in
her
ear
herself
not
him
she
holdeth
oh
fool
to
be
deceived
by
her
to
sate
her
selfish
thirst
she
quaffs
the
love
of
strong
hearts
in
sweet
draughts
then
throws
them
lightly
by
and
laughs
too
weak
to
understand
their
pain
as
changeful
as
the
winds
that
blow
from
every
region
to
and
fro
devoid
of
heart
she
can
not
know
the
suffering
of
a
human
heart
i
knew
the
cold
fixed
gaze
of
eyes
saw
the
slow
colour
to
my
forehead
rise
but
lightly
answered
toying
with
my
fan
sentiment
is
very
like
a
man
men
call
us
fickle
but
they
do
us
wrong
only
frail
and
helpless
men
are
strong
and
when
love
dies
they
take
the
poor
dead
thing
and
make
a
shroud
out
of
their
suffering
and
drag
the
corpse
about
with
them
for
years
but
we
mourn
it
for
a
day
with
tears
and
then
we
robe
it
for
its
last
long
rest
and
being
women
feeble
things
at
best
we
can
not
dig
the
grave
ourselves
and
so
we
call
new
love
to
lay
it
low
immortal
sexton
he
whom
venus
sends
to
do
this
service
for
her
earthly
friends
the
trusty
fellow
digs
the
grave
so
deep
nothing
disturbs
the
dead
laid
there
to
the
laugh
that
followed
had
not
died
away
ere
roy
montaine
came
seeking
me
to
say
the
band
was
tuning
for
our
waltz
and
so
back
to
the
bore
me
in
the
glow
and
heat
and
whirl
my
strength
ere
long
was
spent
and
i
grew
faint
and
dizzy
and
we
went
out
on
the
cool
moonlighted
portico
and
sitting
there
roy
drew
my
languid
head
upon
the
shelter
of
his
breast
and
bent
his
smiling
eyes
upon
me
as
he
said
try
the
mesmerism
of
my
touch
to
work
a
cure
be
very
quiet
now
and
let
me
make
some
passes
your
brow
why
how
it
throbs
exercised
too
much
i
shall
not
let
you
dance
again
just
then
before
us
in
the
broad
moonlight
two
forms
were
mirrored
and
i
turned
my
face
to
catch
the
teasing
and
mischievous
glance
of
eyes
as
heated
by
the
dance
leaning
on
arm
she
sought
this
place
beg
your
pardon
came
in
that
round
tone
of
his
low
voice
think
we
do
bowing
they
turned
and
left
us
quite
alone
ere
i
could
speak
or
change
my
attitude
part
v
a
visit
to
a
cave
some
miles
away
was
next
in
order
so
one
sunny
day
four
prancing
steeds
conveyed
a
laughing
load
of
merry
the
road
a
basket
picnic
music
and
croquet
were
in
the
programme
skies
were
blue
and
clear
and
cool
winds
whispered
of
the
autumn
near
the
filled
the
time
with
pleasure
some
floated
to
the
rhythmic
measure
some
played
some
promenaded
on
the
green
ticked
off
by
happy
hearts
the
moments
passed
the
afternoon
all
glow
and
glimmer
came
helen
and
roy
were
leaders
of
some
game
and
vivian
was
not
visible
i
challenge
you
to
climb
yon
cliff
with
me
and
who
shall
tire
or
reach
the
summit
last
must
pay
a
forfeit
cried
a
romping
maid
start
at
once
or
own
you
are
so
challenged
i
made
ready
for
the
race
deciding
first
the
forfeit
was
to
be
a
handsome
pair
of
bootees
to
replace
the
loss
who
made
the
rough
ascent
the
cliff
was
steep
and
stony
on
we
went
as
eagerly
as
if
the
path
was
fame
and
what
we
climbed
for
glory
and
a
name
my
hands
were
bruised
my
garments
sadly
rent
but
on
i
clambered
soon
i
heard
a
cry
maurine
my
strength
is
wholly
spent
won
the
boots
going
and
back
she
turned
in
spite
of
laugh
and
jeer
i
reached
the
summit
and
its
solitude
wherein
no
living
creature
did
intrude
save
some
sad
birds
that
wheeled
and
circled
near
i
found
far
sweeter
than
the
scene
below
alone
with
one
who
knew
my
hidden
woe
i
did
not
feel
so
much
alone
as
when
i
mixed
with
unthinking
throngs
of
men
some
flowers
that
decked
the
barren
sterile
place
i
plucked
and
read
the
lesson
they
conveyed
that
in
our
lives
albeit
dark
with
shade
and
rough
and
hard
with
labour
yet
may
grow
the
flowers
of
patience
sympathy
and
grace
as
i
walked
on
in
meditative
thought
a
serpent
writhed
across
my
pathway
not
a
large
or
deadly
serpent
yet
the
sight
filled
me
with
ghastly
terror
and
affright
i
shrieked
aloud
a
darkness
veiled
my
and
i
fell
fainting
the
watchful
skies
i
was
no
coward
and
born
i
had
no
feeling
but
the
keenest
scorn
for
those
fine
lady
and
of
fear
so
much
assumed
when
any
man
is
near
but
god
implanted
in
each
human
heart
a
natural
horror
and
a
sickly
dread
of
that
accursèd
slimy
creeping
thing
that
squirms
a
limbless
carcass
the
ground
and
where
that
inborn
loathing
is
not
found
find
the
serpent
qualities
instead
who
fears
it
not
himself
is
next
of
kin
and
in
his
bosom
holds
some
treacherous
art
whereby
to
counteract
its
venomed
sting
and
all
are
sired
by
of
sin
who
loathes
not
that
foul
creature
of
the
dust
however
fair
in
seeming
i
distrust
i
woke
from
my
unconsciousness
to
know
i
leaned
upon
a
broad
and
manly
breast
and
voice
was
speaking
soft
and
low
sweet
whispered
words
of
passion
and
i
dared
not
breathe
had
i
found
shore
was
this
a
foretaste
of
eternal
bliss
love
he
sighed
his
voice
like
winds
that
moan
before
a
rain
in
own
for
one
sweet
stolen
moment
lie
and
rest
upon
this
heart
that
loves
and
hates
you
both
o
fair
false
face
why
were
you
made
so
fair
o
mouth
of
southern
sweetness
that
ripe
kiss
that
hangs
upon
you
i
do
take
an
oath
lips
shall
never
gather
there
there
i
steal
it
from
him
are
you
his
nay
you
are
mine
this
moment
as
i
blind
you
were
what
you
you
would
be
mine
in
all
the
years
to
come
fair
fiend
i
love
and
hate
you
in
a
breath
o
god
if
this
white
pallor
were
but
and
i
were
stretched
beside
you
cold
and
dumb
my
arms
about
you
fond
embrace
my
lips
pressed
your
dying
face
how
dare
you
bring
me
to
such
shame
how
dare
you
drive
me
to
an
act
like
this
to
steal
from
your
unconscious
lips
the
kiss
you
lured
me
on
to
think
my
rightful
claim
o
frail
and
puny
woman
could
you
know
the
devil
that
you
waken
in
the
hearts
you
snare
and
bind
in
your
enticing
arts
the
thin
pale
stuff
that
in
your
veins
doth
flow
would
freeze
in
terror
strange
you
have
such
power
to
please
or
pain
us
poor
weak
soulless
devoid
of
passion
as
a
senseless
flower
like
butterflies
your
only
boast
your
wings
there
now
i
scorn
you
from
this
hour
and
hate
myself
for
having
talked
of
love
he
pushed
me
from
him
and
i
felt
as
those
doomed
angels
must
when
pearly
gates
above
are
closed
against
them
with
a
feigned
surprise
i
started
up
and
opened
wide
my
eyes
and
looked
about
then
in
confusion
rose
and
stood
before
him
me
i
pray
he
said
quite
coldly
an
hour
ago
i
left
you
with
the
company
below
and
sought
this
cliff
a
moment
since
you
cried
it
seemed
in
sudden
terror
and
alarm
i
came
in
time
to
see
you
swoon
away
need
assistance
down
the
rugged
side
of
this
steep
cliff
i
pray
you
take
my
so
formal
and
constrained
we
passed
along
rejoined
our
friends
and
mingled
with
the
throng
to
have
no
further
speech
again
that
day
next
morn
there
came
a
bulky
document
the
legal
firm
of
blank
and
blank
had
sent
containing
news
unlooked
for
an
estate
which
proved
a
cosy
great
or
in
france
been
left
to
me
my
last
descendant
and
it
brought
a
sense
of
joy
and
freedom
in
the
thought
of
foreign
travel
which
i
hoped
would
be
a
panacea
for
my
troubled
mind
that
longed
to
leave
the
olden
scenes
behind
with
all
their
recollections
and
to
flee
to
some
strange
country
i
was
in
such
haste
to
put
between
me
and
my
native
land
the
briny
desolating
waste
i
gave
aunt
ruth
no
peace
until
she
planned
to
sail
that
week
two
months
though
she
was
fain
to
wait
until
the
springtime
roy
montaine
would
be
our
guide
and
escort
no
one
dreamed
the
cause
of
my
strange
hurry
but
all
seemed
to
think
good
fortune
had
quite
turned
my
brain
one
bright
october
morning
when
the
woods
had
donned
their
purple
mantles
and
red
hoods
in
honour
of
the
frost
king
vivian
came
bringing
some
green
leaves
tipped
with
crimson
flame
first
trophies
of
the
autumn
time
and
roy
made
a
proposal
that
we
all
should
go
and
ramble
in
the
forest
for
a
while
but
helen
said
she
was
not
so
must
stay
at
home
then
vivian
with
a
smile
responded
will
stay
and
talk
to
you
and
they
may
go
at
which
her
two
cheeks
grew
like
twin
blush
with
red
wave
her
fair
face
shone
transfigured
with
great
joy
and
vivian
suddenly
was
grave
roy
took
my
arm
in
that
protecting
way
peculiar
to
some
men
which
seems
to
say
shield
my
own
a
manner
pleasing
when
we
are
conscious
that
it
does
not
mean
more
than
a
simple
courtesy
a
woman
whose
heart
is
wholly
feminine
and
human
and
not
unsexed
by
hobbies
likes
to
be
the
object
of
that
tender
chivalry
that
guardianship
which
man
bestows
on
her
yet
mixed
with
deference
as
if
she
were
half
child
half
angel
though
she
may
be
strong
noble
and
not
afraid
to
raise
her
hand
and
voice
against
all
wrong
and
all
oppression
yet
if
she
be
made
with
all
the
independence
of
her
thought
a
woman
womanly
as
god
designed
albeit
she
may
have
as
great
a
mind
as
man
her
brother
yet
his
strength
of
arm
his
muscle
and
his
boldness
she
has
not
and
can
not
have
without
she
loses
what
is
far
more
precious
modesty
and
grace
so
walking
on
in
her
appointed
place
she
does
not
strive
to
ape
him
nor
pretend
but
that
she
needs
him
for
a
guide
and
friend
to
shield
her
with
his
greater
strength
from
harm
we
reached
the
forest
wandered
to
and
fro
through
many
a
winding
path
and
dim
retreat
till
i
grew
weary
when
i
chose
a
seat
upon
an
which
had
been
laid
low
by
some
wind
storm
or
by
some
lightning
stroke
and
roy
stood
just
below
me
where
the
ledge
on
which
i
sat
sloped
steeply
to
the
edge
of
sunny
meadows
lying
at
my
feet
one
hand
held
mine
the
other
grasped
a
limb
that
cast
its
checkered
shadows
over
him
and
with
his
head
thrown
back
his
dark
eyes
raised
and
fixed
upon
me
silently
he
gazed
until
i
smiling
turned
to
him
and
spoke
words
my
cousin
to
those
thoughts
that
rise
and
like
dumb
spirits
look
forth
from
your
the
smooth
and
even
darkness
of
his
cheek
was
stained
one
moment
by
a
flush
of
red
he
swayed
his
lithe
form
nearer
as
he
stood
still
clinging
to
the
branch
above
his
head
his
brilliant
eyes
grew
darker
and
he
said
with
sudden
passion
you
bid
me
speak
i
can
not
then
keep
silence
if
i
would
that
hateful
fortune
coming
as
it
did
forbade
my
speaking
sooner
for
i
knew
a
world
would
quickly
misconstrue
my
motive
for
a
meaner
one
but
sweet
so
big
my
heart
has
grown
with
love
for
you
i
can
not
shelter
it
or
keep
it
hid
and
so
i
cast
it
throbbing
at
your
feet
for
you
to
guard
and
cherish
or
to
break
maurine
i
love
you
better
than
my
life
my
still
more
my
wife
maurine
maurine
what
answer
do
you
make
i
scarce
could
breathe
for
wonderment
and
numb
with
truth
that
fell
too
suddenly
sat
dumb
with
sheer
amaze
and
stared
at
roy
with
eyes
that
looked
no
feeling
but
complete
surprise
he
swayed
so
near
his
breath
was
on
my
cheek
maurine
he
whispered
you
speak
then
suddenly
as
some
magic
glass
one
picture
in
a
score
of
shapes
will
pass
i
seemed
to
see
roy
glide
before
my
gaze
first
as
the
playmate
of
my
earlier
next
as
my
then
my
valued
friend
and
last
my
lover
as
when
colours
blend
in
some
group
before
our
eyes
we
hold
the
glass
and
look
them
and
so
now
i
gazed
on
roy
in
his
new
guise
in
which
he
appeared
to
me
before
his
form
was
like
a
in
its
grace
so
lithe
and
supple
and
of
medium
height
and
garbed
in
all
the
elegance
of
fashion
his
large
black
eyes
were
full
of
fire
and
passion
and
in
expression
fearless
firm
and
bright
his
hair
was
like
the
very
deeps
of
night
and
hung
in
raven
clusters
a
face
of
dark
and
flashing
beauty
he
was
more
like
some
romantic
grand
ideal
than
like
a
common
being
as
i
gazed
upon
the
handsome
face
to
mine
upraised
i
saw
before
me
living
breathing
real
the
hero
of
my
early
though
so
full
my
heart
was
with
that
face
which
all
unlike
yet
claimed
the
place
i
had
not
recognised
him
so
before
or
thought
of
him
save
as
a
valued
friend
so
now
i
called
him
adding
boy
each
word
of
love
you
utter
aims
a
blow
at
that
sweet
trust
i
had
reposed
in
you
i
was
so
certain
i
had
found
a
true
steadfast
man
friend
on
whom
i
could
depend
and
go
on
wholly
trusting
to
the
end
why
did
you
shatter
my
delusion
roy
by
turning
to
a
lover
indeed
because
i
loved
you
more
than
any
brother
or
any
friend
could
then
he
began
to
argue
like
a
lawyer
and
to
plead
with
all
his
eloquence
and
listening
i
strove
to
think
it
was
a
goodly
thing
to
be
so
fondly
loved
by
such
a
man
and
it
were
best
to
give
his
wooing
heed
and
not
deny
him
then
before
my
eyes
in
all
its
majesty
that
other
haughty
and
face
would
rise
and
rob
my
purpose
of
all
life
and
strength
roy
urged
and
argued
as
roy
only
could
with
that
impetuous
boyish
eloquence
he
held
my
hands
and
vowed
i
must
and
should
give
some
least
hope
till
in
my
own
defence
i
turned
upon
him
and
replied
at
length
thank
you
for
the
noble
heart
you
offer
but
it
deserves
a
true
one
in
exchange
i
could
love
you
if
i
loved
not
another
who
keeps
my
heart
so
i
have
none
to
then
seeing
how
his
dark
eyes
flashed
i
said
roy
i
know
my
words
seem
very
strange
but
i
love
one
i
can
not
hope
to
a
river
rolls
between
us
dark
and
deep
to
cross
to
stain
with
blood
my
hand
you
force
my
speech
on
what
i
fain
would
keep
in
my
own
bosom
but
you
understand
my
heart
is
given
to
love
sanctified
and
now
can
feel
no
other
be
you
kind
dear
roy
my
brother
speak
of
this
no
more
lest
pleading
and
denying
should
divide
the
hearts
so
long
united
let
me
find
in
you
my
cousin
and
my
friend
of
yore
and
now
come
home
the
morning
all
too
soon
and
unperceived
has
melted
into
noon
helen
will
miss
us
and
we
must
he
took
my
hand
and
helped
me
to
arise
smiling
upon
me
with
his
sad
dark
eyes
where
fires
had
sudden
ceased
to
burn
so
he
said
soon
and
unforeseen
my
friendship
melted
into
love
maurine
but
sweet
i
am
not
wholly
in
the
blame
for
what
you
term
my
folly
you
forgot
so
long
known
each
other
i
had
not
in
truth
a
or
a
claim
but
i
remembered
when
through
every
nerve
your
lightest
touch
went
thrilling
and
began
to
love
you
with
that
human
love
of
man
for
comely
woman
by
your
coaxing
arts
you
won
your
way
into
my
heart
of
hearts
and
all
platonic
feelings
put
to
rout
a
maid
should
never
lay
aside
reserve
with
one
not
her
kinsman
out
and
out
but
as
we
now
with
measured
steps
retrace
the
path
we
came
so
my
heart
send
at
your
command
back
to
the
olden
place
and
strive
to
love
you
only
as
a
i
felt
the
justice
of
his
mild
reproof
but
answered
laughing
the
same
old
cry
woman
tempted
me
and
i
did
since
time
heard
it
but
try
and
be
more
prudent
sir
and
hold
aloof
the
fruit
i
never
once
had
thought
so
sweet
tempt
you
any
now
go
dress
for
dinner
thou
sinned
against
as
also
will
the
sinner
and
guard
each
act
that
no
least
look
betray
passed
between
then
i
turned
away
and
sought
my
room
low
humming
some
old
air
that
ceased
upon
the
threshold
for
mine
eyes
fell
on
a
face
so
glorified
and
fair
all
other
senses
merged
in
that
of
sight
were
lost
in
contemplation
of
the
bright
and
picture
which
had
otherwise
made
dim
my
vision
waiting
in
my
room
her
whole
face
lit
as
by
an
inward
flame
that
shed
its
halo
her
helen
stood
her
fair
hands
folded
like
a
leaves
weighed
down
by
happy
dews
of
summer
eves
upon
her
cheek
the
colour
went
and
came
as
sunlight
flickers
a
bed
of
bloom
and
like
some
slim
young
sapling
of
the
wood
her
slender
form
leaned
slightly
and
her
hair
fell
her
loosely
in
long
curling
strands
all
unconfined
and
as
by
loving
hands
tossed
into
bright
confusion
standing
there
her
starry
eyes
uplifted
she
did
seem
like
some
unearthly
creature
of
a
dream
until
she
started
forward
gliding
slowly
and
broke
the
breathless
silence
speaking
lowly
as
one
grown
meek
and
humble
in
an
hour
bowing
before
some
new
and
mighty
power
maurine
she
murmured
and
again
my
own
sweet
friend
maurine
and
then
laying
her
hands
upon
my
head
she
leaned
and
looked
into
my
eyes
and
said
with
voice
that
bore
her
joy
in
tone
as
winds
that
blow
across
a
garden
bed
are
weighed
with
fragrance
is
mine
alone
and
i
am
very
own
so
pledged
this
hour
by
that
most
sacred
tie
save
one
beneath
sky
i
could
not
wait
to
tell
you
of
my
bliss
i
want
your
blessing
sweetheart
and
your
so
hiding
my
trouble
with
a
smile
i
leaned
and
kissed
her
dainty
mouth
the
while
i
felt
a
as
of
some
sweet
sin
when
my
lips
fell
where
his
so
late
had
been
and
all
day
long
i
bore
about
with
me
a
sense
of
mixed
with
satisfaction
as
some
starved
child
might
steal
a
loaf
and
be
sad
with
the
guilt
resulting
from
her
action
while
yet
the
morsel
in
her
mouth
was
sweet
that
when
the
house
had
settled
down
to
sleep
and
quiet
to
my
room
there
crept
a
lithe
young
form
robed
in
a
long
white
gown
with
steps
like
fall
of
she
came
her
mouth
and
breathing
low
my
name
nestled
in
graceful
beauty
at
my
feet
she
murmured
softly
i
sleep
i
needs
must
tell
you
all
my
tale
of
joy
beginning
where
you
left
and
roy
you
saw
the
colour
flame
upon
my
cheek
when
vivian
spoke
of
staying
so
did
he
and
when
we
were
alone
he
gazed
at
me
with
such
a
strange
look
in
his
eyes
the
silence
deepened
and
i
tried
to
speak
upon
some
common
topic
but
could
not
my
heart
was
in
such
tumult
in
this
wise
five
happy
moments
glided
by
us
fraught
with
hours
of
feeling
vivian
rose
up
then
and
came
and
stood
by
me
and
stroked
my
hair
and
in
his
low
voice
and
again
said
little
helen
frail
and
then
took
my
face
and
turned
it
to
the
light
and
looking
in
my
eyes
and
seeing
what
was
shining
from
them
murmured
sweet
and
low
eyes
you
can
not
veil
the
truth
from
sight
you
love
me
helen
answer
is
it
so
and
i
made
answer
straightway
my
life
and
soul
and
strength
i
love
you
o
my
love
he
leaned
and
took
me
gently
to
his
breast
and
said
then
this
dainty
head
shall
rest
henceforth
for
ever
o
my
little
dove
my
fragile
and
then
i
told
him
all
my
thoughts
and
he
listened
with
kisses
for
his
comments
till
my
tale
was
finished
then
he
said
will
be
frank
with
you
my
darling
from
the
start
and
hide
no
secret
from
you
in
my
heart
i
love
you
helen
but
you
are
not
first
to
rouse
that
love
to
being
ere
we
met
i
loved
a
woman
dreaming
she
was
not
all
in
truth
she
was
in
seeming
enough
she
proved
to
be
that
thing
accursed
of
god
and
wily
vain
coquette
i
hate
myself
for
having
loved
her
yet
so
much
my
heart
spent
on
her
it
must
give
a
love
less
ardent
and
less
prodigal
albeit
just
as
tender
and
as
a
milder
yet
a
faithful
love
to
you
just
as
some
evil
fortune
might
befall
a
great
riches
causing
him
to
live
in
some
low
cot
all
unpretending
still
as
much
his
much
his
loved
retreat
as
was
the
princely
palace
on
the
hill
so
i
give
you
all
left
my
sweet
of
my
were
more
to
me
i
made
swift
smiling
answer
to
be
the
worshipped
consort
of
a
and
so
our
faith
was
pledged
but
vivian
would
not
go
until
i
vowed
to
wed
him
new
year
day
and
i
am
sad
because
you
go
away
before
that
time
i
shall
not
feel
half
wed
without
you
here
postpone
your
trip
and
stay
and
be
my
i
can
not
dear
disarrange
our
plans
for
half
a
year
be
in
europe
new
year
day
i
said
send
congratulations
by
the
and
from
my
soul
thanked
providence
for
sparing
the
pain
to
me
of
sharing
in
and
wearing
the
festal
garments
of
a
wedding
scene
while
all
my
heart
was
hung
with
sable
forgetting
for
a
season
that
between
the
cup
and
lip
lies
many
a
chance
of
loss
i
lived
in
my
near
future
confident
all
would
be
as
i
planned
it
and
across
the
briny
waste
of
waters
i
should
find
some
balm
and
comfort
for
my
troubled
mind
the
sad
fall
days
like
maidens
and
in
purple
garments
dressed
passed
by
and
dropped
their
tears
upon
the
tomb
of
fair
queen
summer
buried
in
her
bloom
roy
left
us
for
a
time
and
helen
went
to
make
the
nuptial
preparations
then
aunt
ruth
complained
one
day
of
feeling
ill
her
veins
ran
red
with
fever
and
the
skill
of
two
physicians
could
not
stem
the
tide
the
house
that
rang
so
late
with
laugh
and
jest
grew
ghostly
with
low
whispered
sounds
and
when
the
autumn
day
that
i
had
thought
to
be
bounding
upon
the
billows
of
the
sea
came
sobbing
in
it
found
me
pale
and
worn
striving
to
keep
away
that
unloved
guest
who
comes
unbidden
making
hearts
to
mourn
through
all
the
anxious
weeks
i
watched
beside
the
couch
roy
was
my
help
and
stay
others
were
kind
but
he
alone
each
day
brought
strength
and
comfort
by
his
cheerful
face
and
hopeful
words
that
fell
in
that
sad
place
like
rays
of
light
upon
a
darkened
way
november
passed
and
winter
crisp
and
chill
in
robes
of
ermine
walked
on
plain
and
hill
returning
light
and
life
dispelled
the
gloom
that
cheated
death
had
brought
us
from
the
tomb
aunt
ruth
was
saved
and
slowly
getting
was
dressed
each
day
and
walked
about
the
room
then
came
one
morning
in
the
eastern
mail
a
little
birdling
of
a
letter
i
broke
the
seal
and
read
my
own
i
hear
aunt
ruth
is
better
and
am
glad
i
felt
so
sorry
for
you
and
so
sad
to
think
i
left
you
when
i
to
bear
your
pain
and
worry
and
those
nights
of
weary
anxious
watching
vivian
writes
your
plans
are
changed
now
and
you
will
not
sail
before
the
springtime
so
come
and
be
my
bridesmaid
darling
do
not
say
me
nay
but
three
weeks
more
of
girlhood
left
to
me
come
if
you
can
just
two
weeks
from
and
make
your
preparations
here
my
sweet
indeed
i
am
not
glad
aunt
ruth
was
sorry
she
has
suffered
so
and
still
thankful
something
happened
so
you
stayed
sure
my
wedding
would
be
incomplete
without
your
presence
selfish
afraid
think
your
helen
but
i
love
you
so
how
can
i
be
quite
willing
you
should
go
come
christmas
eve
or
earlier
let
me
know
and
i
will
meet
you
dearie
at
the
train
your
happy
loving
then
the
pain
that
hidden
under
later
pain
and
care
had
made
no
moan
but
silent
seemed
to
sleep
woke
from
its
lethargy
to
steep
my
tortured
heart
in
anguish
and
despair
i
had
relied
too
fully
on
my
skill
in
bending
circumstances
to
my
will
and
now
i
was
rebuked
and
made
to
see
that
god
alone
knoweth
what
is
to
be
then
came
a
messenger
from
vivian
who
came
not
himself
as
he
was
wont
to
do
but
sent
his
servant
each
new
day
to
bring
a
kindly
message
or
an
offering
of
juicy
fruits
to
cool
the
lips
of
fever
or
dainty
blossoms
with
their
bloom
to
brighten
up
the
room
but
now
the
servant
only
brought
a
line
from
vivian
dangerfield
to
roy
montaine
sir
and
letters
bold
and
plain
written
on
paper
so
it
ran
is
the
will
and
pleasure
of
miss
trevor
and
therefore
doubly
so
a
wish
of
mine
that
you
shall
honour
me
next
new
year
eve
my
wedding
hour
by
standing
as
best
man
miss
trevor
has
six
bridesmaids
i
believe
being
myself
a
novice
in
the
if
i
should
fail
in
acting
well
my
part
need
protection
the
regiment
of
outraged
ladies
so
i
pray
consent
to
stand
by
me
in
time
of
need
and
shield
your
friend
sincerely
vivian
the
last
least
hope
had
vanished
i
must
drain
to
the
dregs
this
bitter
cup
of
pain
part
vi
there
was
a
week
of
bustle
and
of
hurry
a
stately
home
echoed
to
voices
sweet
calling
replying
and
to
tripping
feet
of
busy
bridesmaids
running
to
and
fro
with
all
that
girlish
fluttering
and
flurry
preceding
such
occasions
room
was
like
a
all
in
bloom
decked
with
the
dainty
robes
of
her
trousseau
my
robe
was
fashioned
by
swift
skilful
a
thing
of
beauty
elegant
and
rich
a
mystery
of
loopings
puffs
and
bands
and
as
i
watched
it
growing
stitch
by
stitch
i
felt
as
one
might
feel
who
should
behold
with
vision
where
his
body
lay
in
deathly
slumber
simulating
clay
his
sewed
together
fold
on
fold
i
lived
with
nerve
upon
the
strain
as
men
go
into
battle
and
the
pain
that
more
and
more
to
my
sad
heart
revealed
grew
ghastly
with
its
horrors
was
concealed
from
mortal
eyes
by
superhuman
power
that
god
bestowed
upon
me
hour
by
hour
what
night
the
old
year
gave
unto
the
new
the
key
of
human
happiness
and
woe
the
pointed
stars
upon
their
field
of
blue
shone
white
and
perfect
a
world
below
of
beauty
all
the
trees
were
dressed
in
gleaming
garments
decked
with
diadems
each
seeming
like
a
guest
coming
with
a
gift
of
gems
the
bustle
of
the
the
sound
of
eager
voices
in
discourse
the
clang
of
bells
thud
of
feet
that
beat
swift
music
on
the
frozen
all
blent
together
in
my
brain
and
rang
a
medley
of
strange
noises
incomplete
and
full
of
discords
then
out
on
the
night
streamed
from
the
open
vestibule
a
light
that
lit
the
velvet
blossoms
which
we
trod
with
all
the
hues
of
those
that
deck
the
sod
the
grand
cathedral
windows
were
ablaze
with
gorgeous
colours
through
a
sea
of
bloom
up
the
long
aisle
to
join
the
waiting
groom
the
bridal
cortège
passed
as
some
lost
soul
might
surge
on
with
the
curious
crowd
to
gaze
upon
its
coffined
body
so
i
went
with
that
glad
festal
throng
the
organ
sent
great
waves
of
melody
along
the
air
that
broke
and
fell
in
liquid
drops
like
spray
on
happy
hearts
that
listened
but
to
me
it
sounded
faintly
as
if
miles
away
a
troubled
spirit
sitting
in
despair
beside
the
sad
and
sea
gave
utterance
to
sighing
sounds
of
dole
we
paused
before
the
altar
framed
in
flowers
the
man
of
god
stood
forth
i
heard
the
solemn
service
open
through
long
hours
i
seemed
to
stand
and
listen
while
each
word
fell
on
my
ear
as
falls
the
sound
of
clay
upon
the
coffin
of
the
worshipped
dead
the
stately
father
gave
the
bride
away
the
bridegroom
circled
with
a
golden
band
the
taper
finger
of
her
dainty
hand
the
last
imposing
binding
words
were
god
has
joined
let
no
man
put
and
all
my
strife
with
self
was
at
an
end
my
lover
was
the
husband
of
my
friend
how
strangely
in
some
awful
hour
of
pain
external
trifles
with
our
sorrows
blend
i
never
hear
the
mighty
thunder
i
never
catch
the
scent
of
heliotrope
nor
see
stained
windows
all
ablaze
with
light
without
that
dizzy
whirling
of
the
brain
and
all
the
ghastly
feeling
of
that
night
when
my
sick
heart
relinquished
love
and
hope
the
pain
we
feel
so
keenly
may
depart
and
its
memory
cease
to
haunt
the
heart
but
some
slight
thing
a
perfume
or
a
sound
will
probe
the
closed
recesses
of
the
wound
and
for
a
moment
bring
the
smart
congratulations
kisses
tears
and
smiles
and
farewells
given
then
across
the
snowy
waste
of
weary
wintry
miles
back
to
my
home
where
through
each
room
for
evermore
pale
phantoms
of
delight
should
aimless
wander
always
in
my
sight
pointing
with
ghostly
fingers
to
the
tomb
wet
with
the
tears
of
living
pain
and
loss
the
sleepless
nights
of
watching
and
of
care
followed
by
that
one
week
of
keenest
pain
taxing
my
weakened
system
and
my
brain
brought
on
a
illness
day
by
day
in
that
strange
apathetic
state
i
lay
of
mental
and
of
physical
despair
i
had
no
pain
no
fever
and
no
chill
but
lay
without
ambition
strength
or
will
knowing
no
wish
for
anything
but
rest
which
seemed
of
all
store
of
gifts
the
best
physicians
came
and
shook
their
heads
and
sighed
and
to
their
score
of
questions
i
replied
with
but
one
languid
answer
and
am
so
i
slept
and
dreamed
i
was
some
feathered
thing
flying
through
space
with
wing
seeking
a
ship
called
rest
all
snowy
white
that
sailed
and
sailed
before
me
just
in
sight
but
always
one
unchanging
distance
kept
and
woke
more
weary
than
before
i
slept
i
slept
and
dreamed
i
ran
to
win
a
prize
a
hand
from
heaven
held
down
before
my
eyes
all
eagerness
i
sought
was
gone
but
shone
in
all
its
beauty
farther
on
i
ran
and
ran
and
ran
in
eager
quest
of
that
great
prize
whereon
was
written
which
ever
just
beyond
my
reach
did
gleam
and
wakened
doubly
weary
with
my
dream
i
dreamed
i
was
a
crystal
drop
of
rain
that
saw
a
lily
on
the
plain
and
left
the
cloud
to
nestle
in
her
breast
i
fell
and
fell
but
nevermore
found
i
fell
and
fell
but
found
no
stopping
place
through
leagues
and
leagues
of
space
while
space
illimitable
stretched
before
and
all
these
dreams
but
wearied
me
the
more
familiar
voices
sounded
in
my
aunt
and
and
but
they
seemed
a
part
of
some
strange
fancy
i
had
dreamed
and
now
remembered
dimly
wrapped
in
gloom
my
mind
lost
hold
of
time
at
last
ignored
its
future
and
forgot
its
past
and
groped
along
the
present
as
a
light
carried
uncovered
through
the
fogs
of
night
will
flicker
faintly
but
i
felt
at
length
when
march
winds
brought
vague
rumours
of
the
spring
a
certain
sense
of
with
my
aching
frame
was
weary
of
repose
and
wanted
action
then
strength
came
back
with
hand
in
hand
to
bring
and
lay
upon
my
sore
and
bleeding
breast
thorny
rose
i
gained
and
failed
one
day
could
ride
and
walk
the
next
would
find
me
prostrate
while
a
flock
of
ghostly
thoughts
like
phantom
birds
would
flit
about
the
chambers
of
my
heart
or
sit
pale
spectres
of
the
past
with
folded
wings
perched
silently
upon
the
voiceless
strings
that
once
resounded
to
happy
lays
so
passed
the
april
days
when
may
came
lightsome
footed
the
lea
accompanied
by
kind
aunt
ruth
and
roy
i
bade
farewell
to
home
with
secret
joy
and
turned
my
wan
face
eastward
to
the
sea
roy
planned
our
route
of
travel
for
all
lands
were
one
to
him
or
burning
sands
or
alps
of
switzerland
or
stately
rome
all
were
familiar
as
the
fields
of
home
there
was
a
year
of
to
and
fro
like
restless
spirits
scaling
mountain
heights
dwelling
among
the
countless
rare
delights
of
lands
historic
turning
dusty
pages
stamped
with
the
tragedies
of
mighty
ages
gazing
upon
the
scenes
of
bloody
acts
of
kings
long
unvarnished
facts
surpassing
wildest
fictions
of
the
brain
rubbing
against
all
people
high
and
low
and
by
this
contact
feeling
self
to
grow
smaller
and
less
important
and
the
vein
of
human
kindness
deeper
seeing
god
unto
the
humble
delver
of
the
sod
and
to
the
ruling
monarch
on
the
throne
has
given
hope
ambition
joy
and
pain
and
that
all
hearts
have
feelings
like
our
own
there
is
no
school
that
disciplines
the
mind
and
broadens
thought
like
contact
with
mankind
the
graybeard
who
has
burned
the
midnight
lamp
and
knowledge
learned
till
sciences
or
classics
hold
no
lore
he
has
not
conned
and
studied
and
is
but
a
babe
in
wisdom
when
compared
with
some
unlettered
who
has
shared
the
hospitalities
of
every
land
felt
touch
of
brother
in
each
proffered
hand
made
man
his
study
and
the
world
his
college
and
gained
this
grand
epitome
of
knowledge
each
human
being
has
a
heart
and
soul
and
self
is
but
an
atom
of
the
whole
i
hold
he
is
best
learnèd
and
most
wise
who
best
and
most
can
love
and
sympathize
makes
us
vain
and
our
banded
minds
go
round
in
little
grooves
but
constant
friction
with
the
world
removes
these
iron
foes
to
freedom
and
we
rise
to
grander
heights
and
all
untrammelled
find
a
better
atmosphere
and
clearer
skies
and
through
its
broadened
realm
no
longer
chained
thought
travels
freely
leaving
self
behind
we
chanced
to
wander
or
to
roam
glad
letters
came
from
helen
happy
things
like
little
birds
that
followed
on
swift
wings
bringing
their
tender
messages
from
home
her
days
were
poems
beautiful
complete
the
rhythm
perfect
and
the
burden
sweet
she
was
so
and
so
blest
my
heart
had
found
contentment
in
that
year
with
health
restored
my
life
seemed
full
of
cheer
the
heart
of
youth
turns
ever
to
the
light
sorrow
and
gloom
may
curtain
it
like
night
but
in
its
very
anguish
and
unrest
it
beats
and
tears
the
folds
away
and
finds
again
the
sunlight
of
the
day
and
yet
despite
the
changes
without
measure
despite
round
on
round
of
pleasure
despite
new
friends
new
suitors
still
my
heart
was
conscious
of
a
something
lacking
where
love
once
had
dwelt
and
afterward
despair
now
love
was
buried
and
despair
had
flown
before
the
healthful
zephyrs
that
had
blown
from
heights
serene
and
lofty
and
the
place
where
both
had
dwelt
was
empty
voiceless
space
and
so
i
took
my
study
art
the
dreary
vacuum
in
my
life
to
fill
and
worked
and
laboured
with
a
right
good
will
aunt
ruth
and
i
took
rooms
in
rome
while
roy
lingered
in
scotland
with
his
joy
a
dainty
little
lassie
grace
kildare
had
snared
him
in
her
flossy
flaxen
hair
and
made
him
captive
we
were
thrown
by
chance
in
contact
with
her
people
while
in
france
the
previous
season
she
was
wholly
sweet
and
fair
and
gentle
so
naïve
and
yet
so
womanly
she
was
at
once
the
pet
of
all
our
party
and
ere
many
days
won
by
her
fresh
face
and
her
artless
ways
roy
fell
a
helpless
captive
at
her
feet
her
home
was
in
the
highlands
and
she
came
of
good
old
stock
of
fair
untarnished
fame
through
all
these
months
roy
had
been
true
as
steel
and
by
his
every
action
made
me
feel
he
was
my
friend
and
brother
and
no
more
the
same
and
trusty
friend
of
yore
yet
in
my
secret
heart
i
wished
i
knew
whether
the
love
he
felt
one
time
was
dead
or
only
hidden
for
my
sake
from
view
so
when
he
came
to
me
one
day
and
said
the
velvet
blackness
of
his
eyes
ashine
with
light
of
love
and
triumph
mine
congratulate
me
she
whom
i
adore
has
pledged
to
me
the
promise
of
her
hand
her
heart
i
have
already
i
was
glad
with
double
gladness
for
it
freed
my
mind
of
fear
that
he
in
secret
might
be
sad
from
march
till
june
had
left
her
moons
behind
and
merged
her
beauty
in
july
there
was
no
message
from
my
native
land
then
came
a
few
brief
lines
by
vivian
penned
death
had
been
near
to
helen
but
passed
by
the
danger
was
now
over
god
was
kind
the
mother
and
the
child
were
both
alive
no
other
child
was
ever
known
to
thrive
as
throve
this
one
nurse
had
been
heard
to
say
the
infant
was
a
wonder
every
way
and
at
command
of
helen
he
would
send
a
lock
of
golden
hair
to
me
and
did
i
on
my
honour
ever
see
such
hair
before
helen
would
write
ere
long
she
gained
quite
slowly
but
would
soon
be
stronger
than
ever
so
the
doctors
said
i
took
the
tiny
ringlet
mayhap
his
hand
had
severed
from
the
head
of
his
own
child
and
pressed
it
to
my
cheek
and
to
my
lips
and
kissed
it
and
all
my
maternal
instincts
seemed
to
rise
and
clamour
for
their
rights
while
my
wet
eyes
rained
tears
upon
the
silken
tress
of
hair
the
woman
struggled
with
her
heart
before
it
was
the
mother
in
me
now
did
speak
moaning
like
rachel
that
her
babes
were
not
and
crying
out
against
her
barren
lot
once
i
bemoaned
the
long
and
lonely
years
that
stretched
before
me
dark
with
eclipse
and
thought
how
my
unmated
heart
would
miss
the
shelter
of
a
broad
and
manly
the
strong
bold
tender
clinging
and
all
pure
possessions
manifold
but
now
i
wept
a
flood
of
bitter
tears
thinking
of
little
heads
of
shining
gold
that
would
not
on
my
bosom
sink
to
rest
of
little
hands
that
would
not
touch
my
cheek
of
little
lisping
voices
and
sweet
lips
that
never
in
my
ear
would
speak
the
blessed
name
of
mother
oh
in
woman
how
mighty
is
the
love
of
offspring
ere
unto
her
untaught
mind
unfolds
the
that
is
half
divine
half
human
of
life
and
birth
the
love
of
unborn
souls
within
her
and
the
creeps
through
her
warm
heart
and
stirs
its
hidden
deeps
and
grows
and
strengthens
with
each
riper
year
as
storms
may
gather
in
a
placid
sky
and
spend
their
fury
and
then
pass
away
leaving
again
the
blue
of
cloudless
day
so
the
tempest
of
my
grief
passed
by
weak
to
mourn
for
what
i
had
resigned
with
the
deliberate
purpose
of
my
mind
to
my
sweet
friend
relinquishing
my
love
i
gave
my
dearest
hope
of
joy
to
her
if
god
from
out
his
boundless
store
above
had
chosen
added
blessings
to
confer
i
would
rejoice
for
her
repine
that
immortal
treasures
were
not
mine
better
my
lonely
sorrow
than
to
know
my
selfish
joy
had
been
woe
better
my
grief
and
my
strength
to
control
than
the
despair
of
her
soul
better
to
go
on
loveless
to
the
end
than
wear
rose
whose
thorn
had
slain
my
friend
work
is
the
salve
that
heals
the
wounded
heart
with
will
most
resolute
i
set
my
aim
to
enter
on
the
weary
race
for
fame
and
if
i
failed
to
climb
the
dizzy
height
to
reach
some
point
of
excellence
in
art
as
the
maker
held
earth
incomplete
till
man
was
formed
and
placed
upon
the
sod
the
perfect
living
image
of
his
god
all
landscape
scenes
were
lacking
in
my
sight
wherein
the
human
figure
had
no
part
in
that
all
lines
of
symmetry
did
all
hues
of
beauty
mingle
so
i
brought
enthusiasm
in
abundance
thought
much
study
and
some
talent
day
by
day
to
help
me
in
my
efforts
to
portray
the
power
majesty
and
grace
stamped
on
some
form
or
looking
from
some
face
this
was
to
be
my
specialty
to
take
human
emotion
for
my
theme
and
make
the
unassisted
form
divine
express
anger
or
sorrow
pleasure
pain
distress
and
thus
to
build
monument
above
the
grave
of
my
departed
hope
and
love
this
is
not
genius
genius
spreads
its
wings
and
soars
beyond
itself
or
selfish
things
talent
has
need
of
some
cross
some
cheated
purpose
some
great
pain
or
loss
must
lay
the
groundwork
and
arouse
ambition
before
it
labours
onward
to
fruition
but
as
the
lark
from
beds
of
bloom
will
rise
and
sail
and
sing
among
the
very
skies
still
mounting
near
and
nearer
to
the
light
impelled
alone
by
love
of
upward
flight
so
genius
does
not
need
to
upon
wings
to
heights
sublime
some
shot
grazing
the
throat
some
venomous
assault
of
birds
of
prey
may
speed
its
flight
toward
the
realm
of
day
and
tinge
with
triumph
every
liquid
note
so
deathless
genius
mounts
but
higher
yet
when
strife
and
envy
think
to
slay
or
fret
there
is
no
balking
genius
only
death
can
silence
it
or
hinder
while
breath
or
sense
of
feeling
it
will
spurn
the
sod
and
lift
itself
to
glory
and
to
god
the
acorn
nor
flowers
can
choke
the
certain
growth
of
upreaching
oak
talent
was
mine
not
genius
and
my
mind
seemed
bound
by
chains
and
would
not
leave
behind
its
selfish
love
and
sorrow
did
i
strive
to
picture
some
emotion
lo
eyes
of
emerald
beauty
dark
as
ocean
dyes
looked
from
the
canvas
and
my
buried
pain
rose
from
its
grave
and
stood
by
me
alive
my
subject
in
some
hue
or
line
the
glorious
beauty
of
his
face
would
shine
so
for
a
time
my
labour
seemed
in
vain
since
it
but
freshened
and
made
keener
yet
the
grief
my
heart
was
striving
to
forget
while
in
his
form
all
strength
and
magnitude
with
grace
and
supple
sinews
were
entwined
while
in
his
face
all
beauties
were
combined
of
perfect
features
intellect
and
truth
with
all
that
fine
rich
colouring
of
youth
how
could
my
brush
portray
aught
good
or
fair
wherein
no
fatal
likeness
should
intrude
of
him
my
soul
had
worshipped
but
at
last
setting
a
watch
upon
my
unwise
heart
that
thus
would
mix
its
sorrow
with
my
art
i
resolutely
shut
away
the
past
and
made
the
toilsome
present
passing
bright
with
dreams
of
what
was
hidden
from
my
sight
in
the
far
distant
future
when
the
soil
should
yield
me
golden
fruit
for
all
my
toil
part
vii
with
much
hard
labour
and
some
pleasure
fraught
the
months
rolled
by
me
noiselessly
that
taught
my
hand
to
grow
more
skilful
in
its
art
strengthened
my
daring
dream
of
fame
and
brought
sweet
hope
and
resignation
to
my
heart
brief
letters
came
from
helen
now
and
then
she
was
quite
yes
quite
well
indeed
but
still
so
weak
and
nervous
when
baby
being
older
should
not
need
such
constant
care
she
would
grow
strong
again
she
was
as
happy
as
a
soul
could
be
no
least
cloud
hovered
in
her
azure
sky
she
had
not
thought
life
held
such
depths
of
bliss
dear
baby
sent
maurine
a
loving
kiss
and
said
she
was
a
naughty
naughty
girl
not
to
come
home
and
see
little
pearl
no
gift
of
costly
jewels
or
of
gold
had
been
so
precious
or
so
dear
to
me
as
each
brief
line
wherein
her
joy
was
told
it
lightened
toil
and
took
the
edge
from
pain
knowing
my
sacrifice
was
not
in
vain
roy
purchased
fine
estates
in
scotland
where
he
built
a
pretty
retreat
and
when
the
roman
languid
heat
made
work
a
punishment
i
turned
my
face
toward
the
highlands
and
with
roy
and
grace
found
rest
and
freedom
from
all
thought
and
care
i
was
a
willing
worker
not
an
hour
passed
idly
by
me
each
i
would
employ
to
some
good
purpose
ere
it
glided
on
to
swell
the
tide
of
hours
forever
gone
my
first
completed
picture
known
as
won
pleasant
words
of
praise
power
much
talent
fairly
so
fell
the
comments
on
my
grateful
ear
swift
in
the
wake
of
joy
and
always
near
walks
her
sad
sister
sorrow
so
my
brush
began
depicting
sorrow
with
pallid
visage
ere
the
rosy
flush
upon
the
beaming
face
of
joy
had
dried
the
careful
study
of
long
months
it
won
golden
opinions
even
bringing
forth
that
certain
sign
of
critique
which
set
both
pieces
down
as
daubs
and
weak
as
empty
heads
that
sang
their
proving
conclusively
the
worth
these
critics
and
reviewers
do
not
use
their
precious
ammunition
to
abuse
a
worthless
work
that
left
alone
they
know
will
find
its
proper
level
and
they
aim
their
batteries
at
rising
works
which
claim
too
much
of
public
notice
but
this
shot
resulted
only
in
some
noise
which
brought
a
dozen
people
where
one
came
before
to
view
my
pictures
and
i
had
my
hour
of
holding
those
frail
baubles
fame
and
an
english
baron
who
had
lived
two
score
of
his
allotted
three
score
years
and
ten
bought
both
the
pieces
he
was
very
kind
and
so
attentive
i
not
being
blind
must
understand
his
meaning
therefore
when
he
said
friend
whom
i
would
make
my
wife
the
and
this
dear
hand
portrayed
i
have
in
my
possession
now
resign
into
my
careful
keeping
and
make
mine
the
joy
and
sorrow
of
your
future
life
i
was
prepared
to
answer
but
delayed
grown
undecided
suddenly
my
mind
argued
the
matter
coolly
pro
and
con
and
made
resolve
to
speed
his
wooing
on
and
grant
him
favour
he
was
good
and
kind
not
young
no
doubt
he
would
be
quite
content
with
my
respect
nor
miss
an
ardent
love
could
give
me
ties
of
family
and
home
and
then
perhaps
my
mind
was
not
above
setting
some
value
on
a
titled
ambitious
weakness
then
my
art
would
be
encouraged
and
pursued
the
same
and
i
could
spend
my
winters
all
in
rome
love
never
more
could
touch
my
wasteful
heart
that
all
its
wealth
upon
one
object
spent
existence
would
be
very
bleak
and
cold
after
long
years
when
i
was
gray
and
old
with
neither
home
nor
children
once
a
wife
i
would
forget
the
sorrow
of
my
life
and
pile
new
sods
upon
the
grave
of
pain
my
mind
so
argued
and
my
sad
heart
heard
but
made
no
comment
then
the
baron
spoke
and
waited
for
my
answer
all
in
vain
i
strove
for
strength
to
utter
that
one
word
my
mind
dictated
moments
rolled
until
at
last
my
torpid
heart
awoke
and
forced
my
trembling
lips
to
say
him
nay
and
then
my
eyes
with
sudden
tears
in
pity
for
myself
and
for
this
man
who
stood
before
me
lost
in
pained
surprise
friend
i
cried
generous
friend
forgive
a
troubled
weakness
as
i
live
in
truth
i
meant
to
answer
otherwise
from
out
its
store
my
heart
can
give
you
naught
but
honour
and
respect
and
yet
methought
i
would
give
willing
answer
did
you
sue
but
now
i
know
cruel
wrong
i
taking
a
heart
that
beat
with
love
most
true
and
giving
in
exchange
an
empty
hand
who
weds
for
love
alone
may
not
be
wise
who
weds
without
it
angels
must
despise
love
and
respect
together
must
combine
to
render
marriage
holy
and
divine
and
lack
of
either
sure
as
fate
destroys
continuation
of
the
nuptial
joys
and
brings
regret
and
gloomy
discontent
to
put
to
rout
each
tender
sentiment
nay
nay
i
will
not
burden
all
your
life
by
that
unloving
wife
nor
will
i
take
the
sin
upon
my
soul
of
wedding
where
my
heart
goes
not
in
whole
however
bleak
may
be
my
single
lot
i
will
not
stain
my
life
with
such
a
blot
dear
friend
farewell
the
earth
is
very
wide
it
holds
some
fairer
woman
for
your
bride
i
would
i
had
a
heart
to
give
to
you
but
lacking
it
can
only
he
whom
temptation
never
has
assailed
knows
not
that
subtle
sense
of
moral
strength
when
sorely
tried
we
waver
but
at
length
rise
up
and
turn
away
not
having
failed
the
autumn
of
the
third
year
came
and
went
the
mild
italian
winter
was
half
spent
when
this
brief
message
came
across
the
sea
darling
i
am
dying
come
to
me
love
which
so
long
the
growing
truth
concealed
stands
pale
within
its
shadow
oh
my
sweet
this
heart
of
mine
grows
fainter
with
each
dying
with
very
weight
of
bliss
oh
come
and
take
the
legacy
i
leave
to
you
before
these
lips
for
evermore
are
dumb
in
life
or
death
helen
this
plaintive
letter
bore
a
month
old
date
and
wild
with
fears
lest
i
had
come
too
late
i
bade
the
old
world
and
new
friends
adieu
and
with
aunt
ruth
who
long
had
sighed
for
home
i
turned
my
back
on
glory
art
and
rome
all
selfish
thoughts
were
merged
in
one
wild
fear
that
she
for
whose
dear
sake
my
heart
had
bled
rather
than
her
sweet
eyes
should
know
one
tear
was
passing
from
me
that
she
might
be
dead
and
dying
had
been
sorely
grieved
with
me
because
i
made
no
answer
to
her
plea
ship
that
sailest
slowly
slowly
on
make
haste
before
a
wasting
life
is
gone
make
haste
that
i
may
catch
a
fleeting
breath
and
true
in
life
be
true
unto
death
ship
sail
on
and
bear
me
the
tide
to
her
for
whom
my
heart
once
died
sail
sail
o
ship
for
she
hath
need
of
me
and
i
would
know
what
her
last
wish
may
be
i
have
been
true
so
true
through
all
the
past
sail
sail
o
ship
i
would
not
fail
at
so
prayed
my
heart
still
and
ever
until
the
weary
lagging
ship
reached
shore
all
sad
with
fears
that
i
had
come
too
late
by
that
strange
source
whence
men
communicate
though
miles
on
miles
of
space
between
them
lie
i
spoke
with
vivian
she
live
the
answer
came
lives
but
hasten
friend
her
journey
draweth
swiftly
to
its
ah
me
ah
me
when
each
remembered
spot
my
own
dear
home
the
lane
that
led
to
the
fields
the
woods
the
lake
burst
on
my
sight
oh
then
self
rose
up
in
asserting
might
oh
then
my
bursting
heart
all
else
forgot
but
those
sweet
early
years
of
lost
delight
of
hope
defeat
of
anguish
and
of
bliss
i
have
a
theory
vague
undefined
that
each
emotion
of
the
human
mind
love
pain
or
passion
sorrow
or
despair
is
a
live
spirit
dwelling
in
the
air
until
it
takes
possession
of
some
breast
and
when
at
length
grown
weary
of
unrest
we
rise
up
strong
and
cast
it
from
the
heart
and
bid
it
leave
us
wholly
and
depart
it
does
not
die
it
can
not
die
but
goes
and
mingles
with
some
restless
wind
that
blows
about
the
region
where
it
had
its
birth
and
though
we
wander
over
all
the
earth
that
spirit
waits
and
lingers
year
by
year
invisible
and
clothèd
like
the
air
hoping
that
we
may
yet
again
draw
near
and
it
may
haply
take
us
unaware
and
once
more
find
safe
shelter
in
the
breast
it
stirred
of
old
with
pleasure
or
unrest
told
by
my
heart
and
wholly
positive
some
old
emotion
long
had
ceased
to
live
that
were
it
called
it
could
not
hear
or
come
because
it
was
so
voiceless
and
so
dumb
yet
passing
where
it
first
sprang
into
life
my
very
soul
has
suddenly
been
rife
with
all
the
old
intensity
of
feeling
it
seemed
a
living
spirit
which
came
stealing
into
my
heart
from
that
departed
day
exiled
emotion
which
i
fancied
clay
so
now
into
my
troubled
heart
above
the
pain
and
sorrow
crept
the
love
and
strife
and
passion
of
a
bygone
hour
possessed
of
all
their
olden
might
and
power
but
a
moment
and
the
spell
was
broken
by
pleasant
words
of
greeting
gently
spoken
and
vivian
stood
before
us
but
i
saw
in
him
the
husband
of
my
friend
alone
the
old
emotions
might
at
times
return
and
fires
leap
up
an
hour
and
burn
but
never
yet
had
i
transgressed
law
by
looking
on
the
man
i
had
resigned
with
any
hidden
feeling
in
my
mind
which
she
his
wife
my
friend
might
not
have
known
he
was
but
little
altered
from
his
face
the
nonchalant
and
almost
haughty
grace
the
lurking
laughter
waiting
in
his
eyes
the
years
had
stolen
leaving
in
their
place
a
settled
sadness
which
was
not
despair
nor
was
it
gloom
nor
weariness
nor
care
but
something
like
the
vapour
the
skies
of
indian
summer
beautiful
to
see
but
spoke
of
frosts
which
had
been
and
would
be
there
was
that
in
his
face
which
cometh
not
save
when
the
soul
has
many
a
battle
fought
and
conquered
self
by
constant
sacrifice
there
are
two
sculptors
who
with
chisels
fine
render
the
plainest
features
half
divine
all
other
artists
strive
and
strive
in
vain
to
picture
beauty
perfect
and
complete
their
statues
only
crumble
at
their
feet
without
the
master
touch
of
faith
and
pain
and
now
his
face
that
perfect
seemed
before
chiselled
by
these
two
careful
artists
wore
a
look
exalted
which
the
spirit
gives
when
soul
has
conquered
and
the
body
lives
subservient
to
its
bidding
in
a
room
which
curtained
out
the
february
gloom
and
redolent
with
perfume
bright
with
flowers
rested
the
eye
like
one
of
bowers
i
found
my
helen
who
was
less
mine
now
than
for
on
the
marble
of
her
brow
his
seal
was
stamped
indelibly
her
form
was
like
the
slender
willow
when
some
storm
has
stripped
it
bare
of
foliage
her
face
pale
always
now
was
ghastly
in
its
hue
and
like
two
lamps
in
some
dark
hollow
place
burned
her
large
eyes
grown
more
intensely
blue
her
fragile
hands
displayed
each
cord
and
vein
and
on
her
mouth
was
that
drawn
look
of
pain
which
is
not
uttered
yet
an
inward
light
shone
through
and
made
her
wasted
features
bright
with
an
unearthly
beauty
and
an
awe
crept
me
gazing
on
her
for
i
saw
she
was
so
near
to
heaven
that
i
seemed
to
look
upon
the
face
of
one
redeemed
she
turned
the
brilliant
lustre
of
her
eyes
upon
me
she
had
passed
beyond
surprise
or
any
strong
emotion
linked
with
clay
but
as
i
glided
to
her
where
she
lay
a
smile
celestial
in
its
sweetness
wreathed
her
pallid
features
home
she
breathed
hands
dear
lips
i
touch
you
and
and
like
the
dying
echo
of
a
voice
were
her
faint
tones
that
thrilled
upon
my
ear
i
fell
upon
my
knees
beside
her
bed
all
agonies
within
my
heart
were
wed
while
to
the
aching
numbness
of
my
grief
mine
eyes
refused
the
solace
of
a
tear
the
tortured
most
merciful
relief
her
wasted
hand
caressed
my
bended
head
for
one
sad
sacred
moment
then
she
said
in
that
low
tone
so
like
the
refrain
my
own
give
not
away
to
pain
the
time
is
precious
ere
another
dawn
my
soul
may
hear
the
summons
and
pass
on
arise
sweet
sister
rest
a
little
while
and
when
refreshed
come
hither
i
grow
weak
with
every
hour
that
passes
i
must
speak
and
make
my
dying
wishes
known
go
and
in
the
halo
of
her
smile
which
seemed
to
fill
the
room
with
golden
light
i
turned
and
left
her
later
in
the
gloom
of
coming
night
i
entered
that
dim
room
and
sat
down
by
her
vivian
held
her
hand
and
on
the
pillow
at
her
side
there
smiled
the
beauteous
of
a
sleeping
child
spoke
helen
three
blissful
years
my
heart
has
dwelt
in
an
enchanted
land
and
i
have
drank
the
sweetened
cup
of
joy
without
one
drop
of
anguish
or
alloy
and
so
ere
pain
embitters
it
with
gall
or
sorrow
fills
it
full
of
tears
and
bids
me
quaff
which
is
the
fate
of
all
who
linger
long
upon
this
troubled
way
god
takes
me
to
the
realm
of
endless
day
to
mingle
with
his
angels
who
alone
can
understand
such
bliss
as
i
have
known
i
do
not
murmur
god
has
heaped
my
measure
in
three
short
years
full
to
the
brim
with
pleasure
and
from
the
fulness
of
an
earthly
love
i
pass
to
immortal
arms
above
before
i
even
brush
the
skirts
of
woe
leave
my
aged
parents
here
below
with
none
to
comfort
them
maurine
sweet
friend
be
kind
to
them
and
love
them
to
the
end
which
may
not
be
far
distant
and
i
leave
a
soul
immortal
in
your
charge
maurine
from
this
most
holy
sad
and
sacred
eve
till
god
shall
claim
her
she
is
yours
to
keep
to
love
and
shelter
to
protect
and
she
touched
the
cherub
at
her
side
and
vivian
gently
bore
her
still
asleep
and
laid
the
precious
burden
on
my
breast
a
solemn
silence
fell
upon
the
scene
and
when
the
sleeping
infant
smiled
and
pressed
my
yielding
bosom
with
her
waxen
cheek
i
felt
it
would
be
sacrilege
to
speak
such
wordless
joy
possessed
me
oh
at
last
this
infant
who
in
that
past
had
caused
my
soul
such
travail
was
my
own
through
all
the
lonely
coming
years
to
be
mine
own
to
mine
alone
and
what
i
mourned
so
hopelessly
as
lost
was
now
restored
and
given
back
to
me
the
dying
voice
continued
this
child
you
yet
have
me
whose
mortal
life
she
cost
but
all
that
was
most
pure
and
undefiled
and
good
within
me
lives
in
her
again
maurine
my
husband
loves
me
yet
i
know
moving
about
the
wide
world
to
and
fro
and
through
and
in
the
busy
haunts
of
men
not
always
will
his
heart
be
dumb
with
woe
but
sometime
waken
to
a
later
love
nay
vivian
hush
my
soul
has
passed
above
all
selfish
feelings
i
would
have
it
so
while
i
am
with
the
angels
blest
and
glad
i
would
not
have
you
sorrowing
and
sad
in
loneliness
go
mourning
to
the
end
but
love
i
could
not
trust
to
any
other
the
sacred
office
of
a
to
this
sweet
cherub
save
my
own
her
to
love
her
name
maurine
he
wanders
keep
my
memory
green
in
her
young
heart
and
lead
her
in
her
youth
to
drink
from
eternal
fount
of
truth
vex
her
not
with
sectarian
discourse
nor
strive
to
teach
her
piety
by
force
ply
not
her
mind
with
harsh
and
narrow
creeds
nor
frighten
her
with
an
avenging
god
who
rules
his
subjects
with
a
burning
rod
but
teach
her
that
each
mortal
simply
needs
to
grow
in
hate
of
hate
and
love
of
love
to
gain
a
kingdom
in
the
courts
above
her
be
free
and
natural
as
the
flowers
that
smile
and
nod
throughout
the
summer
hours
let
her
rejoice
in
all
the
joys
of
youth
but
first
impress
upon
her
mind
this
truth
no
lasting
happiness
is
attained
save
when
the
heart
some
seeks
to
please
the
cup
of
selfish
pleasures
soon
is
drained
and
full
of
gall
and
bitterness
the
lees
next
to
her
god
teach
her
to
love
her
land
in
her
young
bosom
light
the
flame
until
the
heart
within
her
shall
expand
with
love
and
fervour
at
her
name
bears
a
valiant
son
and
this
my
last
wish
is
an
earnest
one
my
strength
is
waning
you
have
heard
my
wishes
and
you
will
be
true
in
death
as
you
have
been
in
life
my
own
now
leave
me
for
a
little
while
alone
with
husband
dear
love
i
shall
rest
so
sweetly
with
no
care
upon
my
breast
maurine
come
to
me
in
the
but
lo
the
bridegroom
with
no
further
warning
came
for
her
at
the
dawning
of
the
day
she
heard
his
voice
and
smiled
and
passed
away
without
a
struggle
leaning
her
bed
to
give
her
greeting
i
found
but
her
clay
and
vivian
bowed
beside
it
and
i
said
friend
my
soul
shall
treasure
thy
request
and
when
the
night
of
fever
and
unrest
melts
in
the
morning
of
eternity
like
a
freed
bird
then
i
will
come
to
thee
will
come
to
thee
in
the
morning
sweet
i
have
been
true
and
soul
with
soul
shall
meet
before
throne
and
shall
not
be
afraid
thou
me
trust
and
it
was
not
betrayed
will
come
to
thee
in
the
morning
dear
the
night
is
dark
i
do
not
know
how
near
the
morn
may
be
of
that
eternal
day
i
can
but
keep
my
faithful
watch
and
pray
will
come
to
thee
in
the
morning
love
wait
for
me
on
the
eternal
heights
above
the
way
is
troubled
where
my
feet
must
climb
ere
i
shall
tread
the
sublime
will
come
in
the
morning
o
mine
own
but
for
a
time
must
grope
my
way
alone
through
tears
and
sorrow
till
the
day
shall
dawn
and
i
shall
hear
the
summons
and
pass
on
will
come
in
the
morning
rest
secure
my
hope
is
certain
and
my
faith
is
sure
after
the
gloom
and
darkness
of
the
night
i
will
come
to
thee
with
the
morning
three
peaceful
years
slipped
silently
away
we
dwelt
together
in
my
home
aunt
ruth
and
i
and
may
she
was
a
fair
and
most
exquisite
child
her
pensive
face
was
delicate
and
mild
like
her
dead
but
through
her
dear
eyes
her
father
smiled
upon
me
day
by
day
afar
in
foreign
countries
did
he
roam
now
resting
under
blue
skies
and
now
with
roy
in
scotland
and
he
sent
brief
friendly
letters
telling
where
he
went
and
what
he
saw
addressed
to
may
or
me
and
i
would
write
and
tell
him
how
she
and
how
she
talked
about
him
the
sea
in
her
sweet
baby
fashion
how
she
knew
his
picture
in
the
album
how
each
day
she
knelt
and
prayed
the
blessed
lord
would
bring
her
own
papa
back
to
his
little
may
it
was
a
warm
bright
morning
in
the
spring
i
sat
in
that
same
sunny
portico
where
i
was
sitting
seven
years
ago
when
vivian
came
my
eyes
were
full
of
tears
as
i
looked
back
across
the
checkered
years
how
many
were
the
changes
they
had
brought
pain
death
and
sorrow
but
the
lesson
taught
to
my
young
heart
had
been
of
untold
worth
i
had
learned
how
to
and
grow
that
knowledge
which
best
serves
us
here
on
earth
and
brings
reward
in
heaven
oh
how
long
the
years
had
been
since
that
june
morning
when
i
heard
his
step
upon
the
walk
and
yet
i
seemed
to
hear
its
echo
still
just
then
down
that
same
path
i
turned
my
eyes
and
lo
the
wanderer
from
a
foreign
land
stood
there
before
me
out
his
hand
and
smiling
with
those
eyes
of
old
to
hide
my
tears
i
ran
and
brought
his
child
but
she
was
shy
and
clung
to
me
when
told
this
was
papa
for
whom
her
prayers
were
said
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
shook
her
little
head
and
would
not
by
his
coaxing
be
beguiled
or
go
to
him
aunt
ruth
was
not
at
home
and
we
two
sat
and
talked
as
strangers
might
of
distant
countries
which
we
both
had
seen
but
once
i
thought
i
saw
his
large
eyes
light
with
sudden
passion
when
there
came
a
pause
in
our
and
then
he
spoke
i
saw
a
number
of
your
friends
in
rome
we
talked
of
you
they
seemed
surprised
because
you
were
not
the
seekers
for
a
name
they
thought
your
whole
ambition
was
for
might
have
been
i
answered
my
heart
had
nothing
else
to
fill
it
now
my
art
is
but
a
recreation
i
have
to
love
and
live
for
which
i
had
not
and
leaning
down
i
pressed
a
tender
kiss
upon
my
fair
brow
yet
he
said
the
old
light
leaping
to
his
eyes
again
yet
maurine
they
say
you
might
have
wed
a
noble
baron
one
of
many
men
who
laid
their
hearts
and
fortunes
at
your
feet
why
won
the
bravest
of
them
no
return
i
bowed
my
head
nor
dared
his
gaze
to
meet
on
cheek
and
brow
i
felt
the
red
blood
burn
and
strong
emotion
strangled
speech
he
rose
and
came
and
knelt
beside
me
my
sweet
he
murmured
softly
in
heaven
knows
how
well
i
loved
you
seven
years
ago
he
only
knows
my
anguish
and
my
grief
when
your
own
acts
forced
on
me
the
belief
that
i
had
been
your
plaything
and
your
toy
yet
from
his
lips
i
since
have
learned
that
roy
held
no
place
nearer
than
a
friend
and
brother
and
then
a
faint
suspicion
undefined
of
what
had
be
stirred
my
mind
and
that
great
love
i
thought
died
at
a
blow
rose
up
within
me
strong
with
hope
and
life
all
heaven
and
the
angel
mother
of
this
sweet
child
that
slumbers
on
your
heart
maurine
maurine
i
claim
you
for
my
mine
own
forever
until
death
shall
part
through
happy
mists
of
upward
welling
tears
i
leaned
and
looked
into
his
beauteous
eyes
heart
i
said
she
who
dwells
above
looks
down
upon
us
from
yon
azure
skies
she
can
but
bless
us
knowing
all
these
years
my
soul
had
yearned
in
silence
for
the
love
that
crowned
her
life
and
left
mine
own
so
bleak
i
turned
you
from
me
for
her
fair
frail
sake
for
her
sweet
and
for
my
own
i
take
you
back
to
be
all
mine
for
just
then
the
child
upon
my
breast
awoke
from
her
light
sleep
and
laid
her
downy
cheek
against
her
father
as
he
knelt
by
me
and
this
unconscious
action
seemed
to
be
a
silent
blessing
which
the
mother
spoke
gazing
upon
us
from
the
mystic
shore
all
roads
that
lead
to
god
are
good
all
roads
that
lead
to
god
are
good
what
matters
it
your
faith
or
mine
both
centre
at
the
goal
divine
of
eternal
brotherhood
the
kindly
life
in
house
or
the
life
of
prayer
and
mystic
the
search
for
truth
and
these
paths
at
one
great
junction
meet
before
the
oldest
book
was
writ
full
many
a
prehistoric
soul
arrived
at
this
unchanging
goal
through
changeless
love
that
leads
to
it
what
matters
that
one
found
his
christ
in
rising
sun
or
burning
fire
if
faith
within
him
did
not
tire
his
longing
for
the
truth
sufficed
before
our
modern
hell
was
brought
to
edify
the
modern
world
full
many
a
soul
was
hurled
in
lakes
of
fire
by
its
own
thought
a
thousand
creeds
have
come
and
gone
but
what
is
that
to
you
or
me
creeds
are
but
branches
of
a
the
root
of
love
lives
on
and
on
though
branch
by
branch
proves
withered
wood
the
root
is
warm
with
precious
wine
then
keep
your
faith
and
leave
me
all
roads
that
lead
to
god
are
good
i
know
not
wherefore
but
mine
eyes
see
bloom
where
other
eyes
see
blight
they
find
a
rainbow
a
sunrise
where
others
but
discern
deep
night
men
call
me
an
enthusiast
and
say
i
look
through
gilded
haze
because
my
gaze
is
cast
i
see
something
that
calls
for
praise
i
say
those
lovely
that
tinted
cheek
of
they
answer
in
amused
surprise
thought
it
a
common
i
say
ever
seen
more
fair
i
seem
to
walk
in
they
answer
with
a
pitying
air
weeds
are
choking
out
the
i
know
not
wherefore
but
god
lent
a
deeper
vision
to
my
sight
on
my
gaze
is
bent
i
catch
the
beauty
infinite
that
underlying
hidden
half
that
all
things
hold
of
deity
so
let
the
dull
crowd
sneer
and
their
eyes
are
blind
they
can
not
see
i
must
do
as
you
do
your
way
i
own
is
a
very
good
way
and
still
there
are
sometimes
two
straight
roads
to
a
town
one
over
one
under
the
hill
you
are
treading
the
safe
and
the
way
that
the
prudent
choose
each
time
and
you
think
me
reckless
and
rash
because
i
prefer
to
climb
your
path
is
the
right
one
and
so
is
mine
we
are
not
like
peas
in
a
pod
compelled
to
lie
in
a
certain
line
or
else
be
scattered
abroad
a
dull
old
world
methinks
my
friend
if
we
all
went
just
one
way
yet
our
paths
will
meet
no
doubt
at
the
end
though
they
lead
apart
you
like
the
shade
and
i
like
the
sun
you
like
an
even
pace
i
like
to
mix
with
the
crowd
and
run
and
then
rest
after
the
race
i
like
danger
and
storm
and
strife
you
like
a
peaceful
time
i
like
the
passion
and
surge
of
life
you
like
its
gentle
rhyme
you
like
buttercups
dewy
sweet
and
crocuses
framed
in
snow
i
like
roses
born
of
the
heat
and
the
red
glow
i
must
live
my
life
not
yours
my
friend
for
so
it
was
written
down
we
must
follow
our
given
paths
to
the
end
but
i
trust
we
shall
town
over
the
banisters
over
the
banisters
bends
a
face
daringly
sweet
and
beguiling
somebody
stands
in
careless
grace
and
watching
the
picture
smiling
the
light
burns
dim
in
the
hall
below
nobody
sees
her
standing
saying
again
soft
and
low
halfway
up
to
the
landing
nobody
only
the
eyes
of
brown
tender
and
full
of
meaning
that
smile
on
the
fairest
face
in
town
over
the
banisters
leaning
tired
and
sleepy
with
drooping
head
i
wonder
why
she
lingers
now
when
the
all
are
said
why
somebody
holds
her
fingers
he
holds
her
fingers
and
draws
her
down
suddenly
growing
bolder
till
the
loose
hair
drops
its
masses
brown
like
a
mantle
over
his
shoulder
over
the
banisters
soft
hands
fair
brush
his
cheeks
like
a
feather
and
bright
brown
tresses
and
dusky
hair
meet
and
mingle
together
a
question
asked
a
swift
caress
she
has
flown
like
a
bird
from
the
hallway
but
over
the
banisters
drops
a
that
shall
brighten
the
world
for
him
alway
the
past
i
fling
my
past
behind
me
like
a
robe
worn
threadbare
in
the
seams
and
out
of
date
i
have
outgrown
it
wherefore
should
i
weep
and
dwell
upon
its
beauty
and
its
dyes
of
oriental
splendour
or
complain
that
i
must
needs
discard
it
i
can
weave
upon
the
shuttles
of
the
future
years
a
fabric
far
more
durable
subdued
it
may
be
in
the
blending
of
its
hues
where
sombre
shades
commingle
yet
the
gleam
of
golden
warp
shall
shoot
it
through
and
through
while
over
all
a
fadeless
lustre
lies
and
starred
with
gems
made
out
of
crystalled
tears
my
new
robe
shall
be
richer
than
the
old
secrets
think
not
some
knowledge
rests
with
thee
alone
why
even
stupendous
secret
death
we
one
by
one
with
our
expiring
breath
do
pale
with
wonder
seize
and
make
our
own
the
bosomed
treasures
of
the
earth
are
shown
despite
her
careful
hiding
and
the
air
yields
its
mysterious
marvels
in
despair
to
swell
the
mighty
of
things
known
in
vain
the
sea
expostulates
and
raves
it
can
not
cover
from
the
keen
sight
the
curious
wonders
of
its
coral
caves
and
so
despite
thy
caution
or
thy
tears
the
prying
fingers
of
detective
years
shall
drag
secret
out
into
the
light
applause
i
hold
it
one
of
the
sad
certain
laws
which
makes
our
failures
sometime
seem
more
kind
than
that
success
which
brings
sure
loss
true
greatness
dies
when
sounds
the
applause
fame
blights
the
object
it
would
bless
because
weighed
down
with
expectancy
the
mind
can
no
more
soar
to
those
far
heights
and
find
that
freedom
which
its
inspiration
was
when
once
we
listen
to
its
noisy
cheers
or
hear
the
approval
then
we
catch
no
more
the
music
of
the
spheres
or
walk
with
gods
and
angels
but
with
men
till
impotent
from
our
fears
the
plaudits
of
the
world
turn
into
sneers
the
story
they
met
each
other
in
the
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
alack
the
day
alack
the
maid
she
blushed
in
swift
surprise
alas
alas
the
woe
that
comes
from
lifting
up
the
eyes
the
pail
was
full
the
path
was
he
reached
to
her
his
hand
she
felt
her
warm
young
pulses
leap
but
did
not
understand
alas
alas
the
woe
that
comes
from
clasping
hand
with
hand
she
sat
beside
him
in
the
he
wooed
with
words
and
sighs
ah
love
in
spring
seems
sweet
and
good
and
maidens
are
not
wise
alas
alas
the
woe
that
comes
from
listing
lovers
sighs
the
summer
sun
shone
fairly
down
the
wind
blew
from
the
south
as
blue
eyes
gazed
in
eyes
of
brown
his
kiss
fell
on
her
mouth
alas
alas
the
woe
that
comes
from
kisses
on
the
mouth
and
now
the
autumn
time
is
near
the
lover
roves
away
with
breaking
heart
and
falling
tear
she
sits
the
livelong
day
alas
alas
for
breaking
hearts
when
lovers
rove
away
lean
down
lean
down
and
lift
me
higher
josephine
from
the
eternal
hills
hast
thou
not
seen
how
i
do
strive
for
heights
but
lacking
wings
i
can
not
grasp
at
once
those
better
things
to
which
i
in
my
inmost
soul
aspire
lean
down
and
lift
me
higher
i
grope
desolate
or
sad
for
youth
and
hope
and
health
all
keep
me
glad
but
too
bright
sunlight
sometimes
makes
us
blind
and
i
do
grope
for
heights
i
can
not
find
oh
thou
must
know
my
one
supreme
lean
down
and
lift
me
higher
not
long
ago
we
trod
the
way
thou
knowest
how
from
day
to
fleeting
day
our
souls
were
vexed
with
trifles
and
our
feet
were
lured
aside
to
which
seemed
sweet
but
only
served
to
hinder
and
to
tire
lean
down
and
lift
me
higher
thou
hast
gone
onward
to
the
heights
serene
and
left
me
here
my
loved
one
josephine
i
am
content
to
stay
until
the
end
for
life
is
full
of
promise
but
my
friend
canst
thou
not
help
me
in
my
best
desire
and
lean
and
lift
me
higher
frail
as
thou
wert
thou
hast
grown
strong
and
wise
and
quick
to
understand
and
sympathize
with
all
a
full
needs
it
must
be
so
thy
year
with
god
hath
made
thee
great
i
know
thou
must
see
how
i
struggle
and
oh
warm
me
with
a
breath
of
heavenly
fire
and
lean
and
lift
me
higher
life
i
feel
the
great
immensity
of
life
all
little
aims
slip
from
me
and
i
reach
my
yearning
soul
toward
the
infinite
as
when
a
mighty
forest
whose
green
leaves
have
shut
it
in
and
made
it
seem
a
bower
for
secrets
or
for
sports
casts
all
its
clustering
foliage
to
the
winds
and
lets
the
eye
behold
it
limitless
and
full
of
winding
mysteries
of
ways
so
now
with
life
that
reaches
out
before
and
borders
on
the
unexplained
beyond
i
see
the
stars
above
me
world
on
world
i
hear
the
awful
language
of
all
space
i
feel
the
distant
surging
of
great
seas
that
hide
the
secrets
of
the
universe
in
their
eternal
bosoms
and
i
know
that
i
am
but
an
atom
of
the
whole
the
new
year
prayer
thou
christ
of
mine
thy
gracious
ear
low
bending
through
these
glad
new
year
days
to
catch
the
countless
prayers
to
heaven
for
hard
hearts
do
raise
some
secret
wish
for
fame
or
gold
or
power
or
freedom
from
all
dear
patient
christ
who
listeneth
hour
on
hour
hear
now
a
prayer
let
this
young
year
that
silent
walks
beside
me
be
as
a
means
of
grace
to
lead
me
up
no
matter
what
betide
me
nearer
the
face
if
it
need
be
that
ere
i
reach
the
fountain
where
living
waters
play
my
feet
should
bleed
from
sharp
stones
on
the
mountain
then
cast
them
in
my
way
if
my
vain
soul
needs
blows
and
bitter
losses
to
shape
it
for
thy
crown
then
bruise
it
burn
it
burden
it
with
crosses
with
sorrows
bear
it
down
do
what
thou
wilt
to
mould
me
to
thy
pleasure
and
if
i
should
complain
heap
full
of
anguish
yet
another
measure
until
i
smile
at
pain
send
but
tell
me
how
to
dare
them
enfold
me
in
thy
care
send
trials
tears
but
give
me
strength
to
bear
this
is
a
prayer
in
the
night
sometimes
at
night
when
i
sit
and
write
i
hear
the
strangest
things
as
my
brain
grows
hot
with
burning
thought
that
struggles
for
form
and
wings
i
can
hear
the
beat
of
my
swift
feet
as
it
speeds
with
a
rush
and
a
whir
from
heart
to
brain
and
back
again
like
a
under
the
spur
with
my
fine
ear
i
listen
and
hear
the
tender
silence
speak
as
it
leans
on
the
breast
of
night
to
rest
and
presses
his
dusky
cheek
and
the
darkness
turns
in
its
sleep
and
yearns
for
something
that
is
kin
and
i
hear
the
hiss
of
a
scorching
kiss
as
it
folds
and
fondles
sin
in
its
hurrying
race
through
leagues
of
space
i
can
hear
the
earth
catch
breath
as
it
heaves
and
moans
and
shudders
and
groans
and
longs
for
the
rest
of
death
and
high
and
far
from
a
distant
star
whose
name
is
unknown
to
me
i
hear
a
voice
that
says
for
i
keep
ward
thee
oh
sweet
and
strange
are
the
sounds
that
range
through
the
chambers
of
the
night
and
the
watcher
who
waits
by
the
dim
dark
gates
may
hear
if
he
lists
aright
measure
god
measures
souls
by
their
capacity
for
entertaining
his
best
angel
love
who
loveth
most
is
nearest
kin
to
god
who
is
all
love
or
nothing
he
who
sits
and
looks
out
on
the
palpitating
world
and
feels
his
heart
swell
within
him
large
enough
to
hold
all
men
within
it
he
is
near
his
great
standard
though
he
dwells
outside
the
pale
of
churches
and
knows
not
a
from
a
or
a
line
of
scripture
even
what
god
wants
of
us
is
that
outreaching
bigness
that
ignores
all
littleness
of
aims
or
loves
or
creeds
and
clasps
all
earth
and
heaven
in
its
embrace
a
march
snow
let
the
old
snow
be
covered
with
the
new
the
trampled
snow
so
soiled
and
stained
and
sodden
let
it
be
hidden
wholly
from
our
view
by
pure
white
flakes
all
trackless
and
untrodden
when
winter
dies
low
at
the
sweet
feet
let
him
be
mantled
in
a
clean
white
sheet
let
the
old
life
be
covered
by
the
new
the
old
past
life
so
full
of
sad
mistakes
let
it
be
wholly
hidden
from
the
view
by
deeds
as
white
and
silent
as
ere
this
earth
life
melts
in
the
eternal
spring
let
the
white
mantle
of
repentance
fling
soft
drapery
about
it
fold
on
fold
even
as
the
new
snow
covers
up
the
old
philosophy
at
morn
the
wise
man
walked
abroad
proud
with
the
learning
of
great
fools
he
laughed
and
said
is
no
force
creates
reason
meek
with
the
wisdom
of
great
faith
at
night
he
knelt
while
angels
smiled
and
wept
and
cried
with
anguished
breath
save
thou
my
last
night
i
knelt
low
at
my
feet
one
soft
caressing
hand
played
with
my
hair
and
one
i
kissed
and
fondled
kneeling
there
i
deemed
my
meed
of
happiness
complete
she
was
so
fair
so
full
of
witching
of
fascinating
tricks
of
mouth
and
eye
so
womanly
withal
but
not
too
and
all
my
heaven
was
compassed
by
her
smiles
her
soft
touch
on
my
cheek
and
forehead
sent
like
little
arrows
thrills
of
tenderness
through
all
my
frame
i
trembled
with
excess
of
love
and
sighed
the
sigh
of
great
content
when
any
mortal
dares
to
so
rejoice
i
think
a
jealous
heaven
bending
low
reaches
a
stern
hand
forth
and
deals
a
blow
sweet
through
the
dusk
i
heard
my
voice
love
she
sighed
carlos
even
now
i
feel
the
perfumed
zephyr
of
her
breath
bearing
to
me
those
words
of
living
death
and
starting
out
the
cold
drops
on
my
brow
for
i
am
carlos
who
is
he
that
in
the
supreme
hour
of
delight
veiled
by
the
shadows
of
the
falling
night
she
should
breathe
low
his
name
forgetting
me
i
will
not
ask
her
a
fruitless
task
for
she
would
make
me
believe
some
tale
and
sigh
and
seem
to
grieve
and
call
me
cruel
nay
i
will
not
ask
but
this
man
carlos
he
be
has
turned
my
cup
of
nectar
into
gall
since
i
know
he
has
claimed
some
one
or
all
of
these
delights
my
lady
grants
to
me
he
must
have
knelt
and
kissed
her
in
some
sad
and
tender
twilight
when
the
day
grew
dim
how
else
could
i
remind
her
so
of
him
why
reveries
like
these
have
made
men
mad
he
must
have
felt
her
soft
hand
on
his
brow
if
heaven
were
shocked
at
such
presumptuous
wrongs
and
plunged
him
in
the
grave
where
he
belongs
she
though
she
loves
me
now
and
if
he
lives
and
meets
me
to
his
cost
why
what
avails
it
i
must
hear
and
see
that
curst
name
always
haunting
so
has
another
paradise
been
lost
the
two
glasses
there
sat
two
glasses
filled
to
the
brim
on
a
rich
table
rim
to
rim
one
was
ruddy
and
red
as
blood
and
one
was
clear
as
the
crystal
flood
said
the
glass
of
wine
to
his
paler
brother
us
tell
tales
of
the
past
to
each
other
i
can
tell
of
a
banquet
and
revel
and
mirth
where
i
was
king
for
i
ruled
in
might
for
the
proudest
and
grandest
souls
on
earth
fell
under
my
touch
as
though
struck
with
blight
from
the
heads
of
kings
i
have
torn
the
crown
from
the
heights
of
fame
i
have
hurled
men
down
i
have
blasted
many
an
honoured
name
i
have
taken
virtue
and
given
shame
i
have
tempted
the
youth
with
a
sip
a
taste
that
has
made
his
future
a
barren
waste
far
greater
than
any
king
am
i
or
than
any
army
beneath
the
sky
i
have
made
the
arm
of
the
driver
fail
and
sent
the
train
from
the
iron
rail
i
have
made
good
ships
go
down
at
sea
and
the
shrieks
of
the
lost
were
sweet
to
me
fame
strength
wealth
genius
before
me
fall
and
my
might
and
power
are
over
all
ho
ho
pale
brother
said
the
wine
you
boast
of
deeds
as
great
as
mine
said
the
can
not
boast
of
a
king
dethroned
or
a
murdered
host
but
i
can
tell
of
hearts
that
were
sad
by
my
crystal
drops
made
bright
and
glad
of
thirsts
i
have
quenched
and
brows
i
have
laved
of
hands
i
have
cooled
and
souls
i
have
saved
i
have
leapt
through
the
valley
dashed
down
the
mountain
slept
in
the
sunshine
and
dripped
from
the
fountain
i
have
burst
my
and
dropped
from
the
sky
and
everywhere
gladdened
the
prospect
and
eye
i
have
eased
the
hot
forehead
of
fever
and
pain
i
have
made
the
parched
meadows
grow
fertile
with
grain
i
can
tell
of
the
powerful
wheel
of
the
mill
that
ground
out
the
flour
and
turned
at
my
will
i
can
tell
of
manhood
debased
by
you
that
i
have
uplifted
and
crowned
anew
i
cheer
i
help
i
strengthen
and
aid
i
gladden
the
heart
of
man
and
maid
i
set
the
captive
free
and
all
are
better
for
knowing
these
are
the
tales
they
told
each
other
the
glass
of
wine
and
its
paler
brother
as
they
sat
together
filled
to
the
brim
on
a
rich
table
rim
to
rim
la
mort
when
was
it
that
love
died
we
were
so
fond
so
very
fond
a
little
while
ago
with
leaping
pulses
and
blood
all
aglow
we
dreamed
about
a
sweeter
life
beyond
when
we
should
dwell
together
as
one
heart
and
scarce
could
wait
that
happy
time
to
come
now
side
by
side
we
sit
with
lips
quite
dumb
and
feel
ourselves
a
thousand
miles
apart
how
was
it
that
love
died
i
do
not
know
i
only
know
that
all
its
grace
untold
has
faded
into
gray
i
miss
the
gold
from
our
dull
skies
but
did
not
see
it
go
why
should
love
die
we
prized
it
i
am
sure
we
thought
of
nothing
else
when
it
was
ours
we
cherished
it
in
smiling
sunlit
bowers
it
was
our
all
why
could
it
not
endure
alas
we
know
not
how
or
when
or
why
this
dear
thing
died
we
only
know
it
went
and
left
us
dull
cold
and
indifferent
we
who
found
heaven
once
in
each
sigh
how
pitiful
it
is
and
yet
how
true
that
half
the
lovers
in
the
world
one
day
look
questioning
in
each
eyes
this
way
and
know
gone
forever
as
we
do
sometimes
i
can
not
help
but
think
dear
heart
as
i
look
out
all
the
wide
sad
earth
and
see
flame
gone
out
on
many
a
hearth
that
those
who
would
keep
love
must
dwell
apart
sleep
vers
de
société
cover
love
with
roses
and
sweet
sleep
he
shall
take
none
but
a
fool
supposes
love
always
keeps
awake
known
loves
without
true
loves
were
they
and
tried
and
just
for
want
of
slumber
they
pined
away
and
died
our
love
was
bright
and
cheerful
a
little
while
agone
now
he
is
pale
and
tearful
seen
him
yawn
so
tired
is
he
of
kisses
that
he
can
only
weep
the
one
dear
thing
he
misses
and
longs
for
now
is
sleep
we
could
not
let
him
leave
us
one
time
he
was
so
dear
but
now
it
would
not
grieve
us
if
he
slept
half
a
year
for
he
has
had
his
season
like
the
lily
and
the
rose
and
it
but
stands
to
reason
that
he
should
want
repose
we
prized
the
smiling
cupid
who
made
our
days
so
bright
but
he
has
grown
so
stupid
we
gladly
say
and
if
he
wakens
tender
and
fond
and
fair
as
when
he
filled
our
lives
with
splendour
take
him
back
again
and
should
he
never
waken
as
that
perchance
may
be
we
will
not
weep
forsaken
but
sing
true
culture
the
highest
culture
is
to
speak
no
ill
the
best
reformer
is
the
man
whose
eyes
are
quick
to
see
all
beauty
and
all
worth
and
by
his
own
discreet
life
alone
reproves
the
erring
when
thy
gaze
turns
in
on
thine
own
soul
be
most
severe
but
when
it
falls
upon
a
let
kindliness
control
it
and
refrain
from
that
belittling
censure
that
springs
forth
from
common
lips
like
weeds
from
marshy
soil
the
voluptuary
oh
i
am
sick
of
love
reciprocated
of
hopes
fulfilled
ambitions
gratified
life
holds
no
thing
to
be
anticipated
and
i
am
sad
from
being
satisfied
the
eager
joy
felt
climbing
up
a
mountain
has
left
me
now
the
highest
point
is
gained
the
crystal
spray
that
fell
from
fair
fountain
was
sweeter
than
the
waters
were
when
drained
the
gilded
apple
which
the
world
calls
pleasure
and
which
i
purchased
with
my
youth
and
strength
pleased
me
a
moment
but
the
empty
treasure
lost
all
its
lustre
and
grew
dim
at
length
and
love
all
glowing
with
a
golden
glory
delighted
me
a
season
with
its
tale
it
pleased
the
longest
but
at
last
the
story
so
oft
repeated
to
my
heart
grew
stale
i
lived
for
self
and
all
i
asked
was
given
i
have
had
all
and
now
am
sick
of
bliss
no
other
punishment
designed
by
heaven
could
strike
me
half
so
forcibly
as
this
i
feel
no
sense
of
aught
but
enervation
in
all
the
joys
my
selfish
aims
have
brought
and
know
no
wish
but
for
annihilation
since
that
would
give
me
freedom
from
the
thought
oh
blest
is
he
who
has
some
aim
defeated
some
mighty
loss
to
balance
all
his
gain
for
him
there
is
a
hope
not
yet
completed
for
him
hath
life
yet
draughts
of
joy
and
pain
but
cursed
is
he
who
has
no
balked
ambition
no
hopeless
hope
no
loss
beyond
repair
but
sick
and
sated
with
complete
fruition
keeps
not
the
pleasure
even
of
despair
the
coquette
alone
she
sat
with
her
accusing
heart
that
like
a
restless
comrade
frightened
sleep
and
every
thought
that
found
her
left
a
dart
that
hurt
her
so
she
could
not
even
weep
her
heart
that
once
had
been
a
cup
well
filled
with
red
wine
save
for
some
drops
of
gall
she
knew
was
empty
though
it
had
not
spilled
its
sweets
for
one
but
wasted
them
on
all
she
stood
upon
the
grave
of
her
dead
truth
and
saw
her
bright
armour
red
with
rust
and
knew
that
all
the
riches
of
her
youth
were
dead
sea
apples
crumbling
into
dust
love
that
had
turned
to
bitter
biting
scorn
hearthstones
despoiled
and
homes
made
desolate
made
her
cry
out
that
she
was
ever
born
to
loathe
her
beauty
and
to
curse
her
fate
if
dear
love
if
you
and
i
could
sail
away
with
snowy
pennons
to
the
winds
unfurled
across
the
waters
of
some
unknown
bay
and
find
some
island
far
from
all
the
world
if
we
could
dwell
there
ever
more
alone
while
unrecorded
years
slip
by
apace
forgetting
and
forgotten
and
unknown
by
aught
save
native
of
the
place
if
winter
never
visited
that
land
and
lap
spilled
with
fruits
and
flowers
and
tropic
trees
cast
shade
on
every
hand
and
twinèd
boughs
formed
bowers
if
from
the
fashions
of
the
world
set
free
and
hid
away
from
all
its
jealous
strife
i
lived
alone
for
you
and
you
for
ah
then
dear
love
how
sweet
were
wedded
life
but
since
we
dwell
here
in
the
crowded
way
where
hurrying
throngs
rush
by
to
seek
for
gold
and
all
is
commonplace
and
workaday
as
soon
as
young
honeymoon
grows
old
since
fashion
rules
and
nature
yields
to
art
and
life
is
hurt
by
daily
jar
and
fret
best
to
shut
such
dreams
down
in
the
heart
and
go
our
ways
alone
love
and
forget
burial
let
us
clear
a
little
space
and
make
love
a
he
is
dead
dear
as
you
see
and
he
wearies
you
and
me
growing
heavier
day
by
day
let
us
bury
him
i
say
wings
of
dead
white
butterflies
these
shall
shroud
him
as
he
lies
in
his
casket
rich
and
rare
made
of
finest
with
the
pollen
of
the
rose
let
us
his
white
eyelids
close
put
the
rose
thorn
in
his
hand
shorn
of
understand
let
some
holy
water
fall
on
his
dead
face
tears
of
as
we
kneel
by
him
and
say
to
dreams
and
turn
away
those
gravediggers
doubt
distrust
they
will
lower
him
to
the
dust
let
us
part
here
with
a
you
go
that
way
i
go
this
since
we
buried
love
we
will
walk
a
separate
way
lippo
now
we
must
part
my
lippo
even
so
i
grieve
to
see
thy
sudden
pained
surprise
gaze
not
on
me
with
such
accusing
thine
own
hand
which
dealt
dear
i
loved
thee
fondly
yesterday
till
then
thy
heart
was
like
a
covered
golden
cup
always
above
my
eager
lip
held
up
i
fancied
thou
wert
not
as
other
men
i
knew
that
heart
was
filled
with
sweet
wine
pressed
wholly
for
my
drinking
and
my
lip
grew
parched
with
thirsting
for
one
nectared
sip
of
what
denied
me
seemed
a
draught
divine
last
evening
in
the
gloaming
that
cup
spilled
its
precious
contents
even
to
the
lees
were
offered
to
me
saying
of
these
and
when
i
saw
it
empty
love
was
killed
no
word
was
left
unsaid
no
act
undone
to
prove
to
me
thou
wert
my
abject
slave
ah
love
hadst
thou
been
wise
enough
to
save
one
little
drop
of
that
sweet
i
still
had
loved
thee
longing
for
it
then
but
even
the
cup
is
mine
i
look
within
and
find
it
holds
not
one
last
drop
to
win
and
cast
it
art
as
other
men
is
love
is
enough
let
us
not
ask
for
gold
wealth
breeds
false
aims
and
pride
and
selfishness
in
those
serene
arcadian
days
of
old
men
gave
no
thought
to
princely
homes
and
dress
the
gods
who
dwelt
on
fair
height
lived
only
for
dear
love
and
delight
love
is
enough
love
is
enough
why
should
we
care
for
fame
ambition
is
a
most
unpleasant
guest
it
lures
us
with
the
glory
of
a
name
far
from
the
happy
haunts
of
peace
and
rest
let
us
stay
here
in
this
secluded
place
made
beautiful
by
endearing
grace
love
is
enough
love
is
enough
why
should
we
strive
for
power
it
brings
men
only
envy
and
distrust
the
poor
homage
pleases
but
an
hour
and
earthly
honours
vanish
in
the
dust
the
grandest
lives
are
ofttimes
desolate
let
me
be
loved
and
let
who
will
be
great
love
is
enough
love
is
enough
why
should
we
ask
for
more
what
greater
gift
have
gods
vouchsafed
to
men
what
better
boon
of
all
their
precious
store
than
our
fond
hearts
that
love
and
love
again
old
love
may
die
new
love
is
just
as
sweet
and
life
is
fair
and
all
the
world
complete
love
is
enough
life
is
love
is
anyone
sad
in
the
world
i
wonder
does
anyone
weep
on
a
day
like
this
with
the
sun
above
and
the
green
earth
under
why
what
is
life
but
a
dream
of
bliss
with
the
sun
and
the
skies
and
the
birds
above
me
birds
that
sing
as
they
wheel
and
with
the
winds
to
follow
and
say
they
loved
who
could
be
lonely
o
ho
not
i
somebody
said
in
the
street
this
morning
as
i
opened
my
window
to
let
in
the
light
that
the
darkest
day
of
the
world
was
dawning
but
i
looked
and
the
east
was
a
gorgeous
sight
one
who
claims
that
he
knows
about
it
tells
me
the
earth
is
a
vale
of
sin
but
i
and
the
bees
and
the
doubt
it
and
think
it
a
world
worth
living
in
someone
says
that
hearts
are
fickle
that
love
is
sorrow
that
life
is
care
and
the
reaper
death
with
his
shining
sickle
gathers
whatever
is
bright
and
fair
i
told
the
thrush
and
we
laughed
laughed
till
the
woods
were
all
and
he
said
to
me
as
he
plumed
each
feather
people
must
croak
if
they
can
not
sing
up
he
flew
but
his
song
remaining
rang
like
a
bell
in
my
heart
all
day
and
silenced
the
voices
of
weak
complaining
that
pipe
like
insects
