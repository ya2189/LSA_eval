mona
gould
apple
orchard
white
as
popcorn
was
the
tree
and
underneath
it
on
the
lea
a
little
goat
looked
up
at
me
bright
and
wicked
was
his
glance
in
that
orchard
sweet
expanse
in
a
mocking
sort
of
dance
moved
his
hooves
he
was
pan
and
he
was
spring
with
a
sudden
saucy
spring
off
he
flew
just
a
shadow
in
the
air
was
he
really
ever
there
for
all
there
are
some
people
who
delight
in
pinning
people
ears
back
tight
i
love
to
be
on
hand
that
day
when
things
work
out
the
other
way
to
snow
or
not
to
snow
feather
down
soft
deep
snow
feather
down
i
implore
you
the
part
of
me
that
poet
simply
adores
you
the
part
of
me
that
working
girl
equally
abhors
you
snow
is
like
thistledown
trees
but
waiting
for
street
cars
it
wet
ankles
and
knees
counsel
heart
be
very
cautious
now
remember
once
before
love
was
like
a
bright
room
then
a
slammed
door
in
a
fit
of
pique
if
you
have
not
learned
to
give
proudly
do
not
prate
to
me
of
love
there
are
those
who
as
children
clutch
tight
the
bottom
of
the
saying
help
yourself
but
making
very
sure
the
gift
is
limited
these
children
grow
up
to
be
stingy
lovers
i
have
no
patience
with
them
it
does
matter
it
does
matter
much
to
me
about
a
person
family
tree
or
what
his
special
vices
are
or
if
he
drives
a
custom
car
or
if
his
clubs
are
old
and
formal
as
long
as
he
is
nice
and
normal
sherry
sherry
twinkling
in
a
little
glass
warm
as
snared
sunlight
a
pool
of
golden
light
to
make
a
flight
of
dreams
i
can
see
your
eyes
twinkling
back
at
the
sherry
merry
as
all
get
out
even
when
i
am
a
very
ancient
lady
and
the
decanter
goes
round
i
shall
remember
you
with
a
sweet
shock
i
be
bound
last
of
the
line
ah
primitive
and
hardy
our
fathers
were
of
old
but
even
on
my
brightest
days
i
ca
quite
shower
cold
teen
age
they
talk
of
sooper
dooper
things
and
wear
each
other
pins
and
rings
they
swim
and
dance
and
ski
and
smoke
and
get
a
bang
from
lemon
coke
play
records
speak
of
dizz
and
duke
and
dance
wherever
there
a
juke
they
change
and
vary
and
suddenly
grow
up
and
marry
top
toad
he
always
said
i
rather
be
dead
than
be
a
small
toad
in
a
big
puddle
i
like
the
huddle
and
power
i
have
in
a
small
town
then
with
a
black
frown
i
prefer
to
be
a
big
toad
in
a
little
puddle
the
only
thing
that
struck
you
as
you
watched
his
tactics
down
his
narrow
road
he
somehow
begun
to
resemble
his
own
model
the
big
toad
war
weary
some
ladies
love
to
sleep
alone
in
solitary
state
chaste
unruffled
and
serene
this
i
hate
whenever
it
is
three
below
i
wish
myself
in
mexico
or
dancing
with
a
hottentot
or
anywhere
where
i
am
not
aftermath
after
holiday
food
i
feel
so
i
long
to
subsist
on
tea
and
moot
question
why
is
it
when
the
wind
blows
i
get
a
red
nose
some
gals
get
all
and
fresh
and
sort
of
jeune
fille
you
should
see
me
lunch
hour
the
conversation
murmurs
in
a
steady
thrum
with
little
quick
arpeggios
of
treble
laughter
the
tables
are
arranged
in
precisely
the
same
order
nothing
is
changed
save
the
day
and
the
year
and
the
certain
knowledge
you
not
be
here
fair
warning
it
may
be
wisdom
dearest
man
to
subjugate
me
while
you
can
because
some
day
i
do
intend
to
seek
the
roadway
farthest
end
witch
i
put
a
little
on
you
to
make
your
drinks
a
bitter
brew
if
you
forget
me
this
i
vowed
and
all
you
did
was
laugh
aloud
perched
on
an
ice
cube
in
your
glass
i
scowl
and
say
a
pretty
pass
to
snatch
a
lady
heart
and
run
egad
me
lad
it
is
done
silly
of
me
my
sweet
to
taunt
you
with
childish
threats
of
how
i
haunt
you
but
still
i
tell
you
if
i
could
o
darling
heart
of
course
i
would
ballet
moment
color
that
is
like
the
diffusion
of
the
bronze
gong
and
little
tinkling
cymbals
highlight
on
hands
and
cheekbones
flying
oriental
brow
smooth
hair
points
piquant
as
almond
buds
costumes
like
chinese
lanterns
swaying
belling
in
and
out
pity
sleep
in
the
curve
of
her
palms
anger
in
the
thrust
of
her
shoulders
this
is
a
mask
come
to
life
and
dancing
brave
voyage
come
my
sweet
let
us
walk
in
the
sleet
if
you
can
keep
your
feet
creep
like
a
couple
of
snails
clinging
to
rails
when
all
else
fails
poets
have
sung
of
walking
in
rain
or
even
snow
fain
would
i
go
in
the
sleet
if
you
can
keep
your
feet
ultimatum
another
blizzard
and
well
i
warn
yuh
i
off
like
a
streak
to
california
black
coffee
smiling
sweetly
respected
trulls
drinking
coffee
from
polished
skulls
a
touch
of
arsenic
one
lump
or
two
and
the
cups
go
round
with
their
deadly
brew
the
atomic
bomb
is
an
awesome
thing
but
so
is
woman
gossipping
sufficient
reason
i
prostitute
my
art
because
it
tactical
for
starving
in
a
garret
is
practical
his
mistress
is
heard
singing
i
long
to
turn
to
you
and
say
hullo
my
darling
how
was
your
day
what
did
you
do
and
who
did
you
meet
and
what
was
the
down
the
street
these
are
the
little
the
darling
things
that
go
together
with
wedding
rings
wide
world
o
when
you
lock
your
doors
each
night
you
either
shut
the
world
outside
or
else
your
own
four
walls
enfold
a
planet
twice
as
far
and
wide
tsk
tsk
mister
santa
if
santa
claus
comes
down
my
chimney
this
year
and
puts
sooty
big
foot
marks
all
over
my
white
hearth
rug
i
going
to
give
him
what
for
last
year
he
not
only
knocked
half
the
ornaments
off
the
tree
and
generally
bunged
things
up
but
he
insisted
on
putting
beer
bottle
tops
in
the
twins
stockings
instead
of
the
annual
quarter
if
santa
claus
comes
down
my
chimney
this
year
and
does
mind
his
p
and
q
i
send
him
off
to
bed
and
finish
the
job
myself
sorcery
what
is
this
shock
of
sweet
delight
that
puts
all
sober
thoughts
to
flight
on
hearing
someone
speak
your
name
this
little
candle
in
my
heart
that
glows
and
burns
and
warms
each
part
of
day
and
night
this
friendly
thing
that
stirs
in
me
till
i
must
sing
your
look
and
voice
the
enchanting
way
you
pin
a
flower
on
my
day
everywoman
song
o
some
men
are
married
to
gorgons
who
swallow
them
at
one
swallow
and
some
are
married
to
frigidaires
and
dwell
in
an
icy
hollow
and
some
there
arc
that
are
bound
in
chains
as
golden
as
they
can
be
but
you
the
luckiest
one
of
all
for
darling
you
just
got
me
sung
in
high
dudgeon
i
like
to
be
the
deadly
type
who
plunge
the
knife
before
they
wipe
the
previous
victim
flowing
gore
from
off
the
blade
sad
to
relate
i
seem
to
be
the
victim
a
sort
of
thing
i
no
desire
for
skewering
my
fellow
man
but
by
observing
i
may
learn
to
give
that
rapier
lightning
turn
wise
child
to
sing
to
you
would
be
absurd
you
not
believe
a
single
word
to
touch
you
would
be
madder
still
and
so
i
sit
and
fill
and
fill
my
eyes
with
looking
like
a
child
who
sees
an
iced
cake
but
knows
from
sad
experience
the
tummy
ache
women
are
like
that
here
in
the
drift
of
the
dunes
he
said
turn
your
head
now
the
curve
of
your
throat
is
a
troubling
song
your
face
is
a
flower
dreaming
and
white
my
heart
cries
out
in
the
rapturous
night
give
me
your
lips
and
your
heart
said
he
but
she
shook
her
head
emphatically
gee
but
you
sweet
the
other
said
and
tilted
back
her
little
head
appreciatively
he
did
call
her
fairest
one
she
did
mind
or
think
it
queer
but
looked
on
him
adoringly
and
whispered
o
my
dearest
dear
they
get
their
heads
together
the
honeyed
malice
drips
and
all
the
gentler
little
wives
get
out
their
blacksnake
whips
it
such
a
pleasant
pastime
the
hours
simply
fly
before
they
know
it
time
to
go
but
who
will
make
the
try
o
who
will
have
the
fortitude
to
rise
and
first
depart
knowing
full
well
the
hungry
horde
is
dining
on
her
heart
hobson
choice
life
is
a
rose
and
life
is
a
thistle
and
life
is
the
screech
of
a
steamboat
whistle
but
nevertheless
if
you
asked
the
dead
they
probably
choose
to
be
in
your
bed
letter
from
paris
you
write
of
paris
like
a
man
telling
of
the
woman
he
loves
there
is
love
in
the
lines
that
draw
the
city
under
rain
the
garrets
that
climb
crazily
against
the
tender
pink
of
the
sky
montmartre
with
the
cafés
just
as
you
read
they
be
everything
just
as
glamorous
just
as
exciting
a
gay
a
mocking
a
shining
shimmering
place
a
feminine
city
your
regret
at
leaving
paris
is
like
parting
from
a
woman
paris
has
wounded
you
with
her
loveliness
conjecture
why
should
i
think
of
you
as
a
perewinkle
retired
out
of
sight
in
your
shell
safe
i
wonder
what
would
happen
if
once
again
in
your
lifetime
someone
armed
with
a
sharp
pin
pricked
you
into
the
daylight
time
was
when
you
were
here
life
did
not
run
in
prim
and
ordered
placid
rows
the
sky
was
full
of
spinning
stars
and
laughter
danced
upon
its
toes
track
this
is
release
this
the
sloughing
off
of
the
outer
husk
the
spruces
lean
to
clutch
you
in
a
green
embrace
but
your
spirit
has
already
outstripped
them
flying
in
arrowy
rhythm
round
a
sudden
turn
in
the
ski
trail
travellers
we
traveled
down
a
grassy
road
o
sweet
it
was
to
wander
and
parted
at
the
forks
of
it
and
this
is
what
i
ponder
would
it
have
been
a
braver
thing
for
us
to
stay
together
in
spite
of
any
single
thing
against
whatever
weather
ailurophile
when
neighbours
cats
begin
to
yowl
and
yammer
you
always
want
to
hit
them
with
a
hammer
but
when
your
own
puts
on
this
spring
display
you
almost
always
wonder
should
we
spay
or
shall
we
add
another
to
our
flock
and
just
have
kittens
all
around
the
clock
o
is
it
a
thing
both
true
and
queer
that
one
cat
calling
falling
on
the
ear
is
troublesome
a
noisome
imposition
while
with
your
cat
it
just
his
disposition
and
all
his
other
graces
far
outnumber
the
yearly
spring
nocturnal
break
of
slumber
word
to
the
wise
little
lady
never
pray
a
ring
of
gold
to
wear
lest
you
find
it
in
your
nose
much
to
your
despair
results
i
have
never
asked
for
much
from
this
world
anointed
strange
to
say
from
day
to
day
i
not
been
disappointed
why
the
lady
the
smallest
hat
is
often
very
short
and
fat
while
slivers
slick
and
very
tall
wear
cartwheels
like
a
parasol
aspiration
i
like
to
be
a
critic
but
one
who
did
write
then
when
i
gouged
their
eyes
out
they
could
turn
and
bite
island
parting
muskoka
how
hard
it
is
to
say
to
an
island
rising
tall
with
its
trees
out
of
clear
water
tawny
in
the
shallows
here
white
birches
bare
their
shining
bones
to
summer
moonlight
and
one
blue
heron
lifts
himself
with
terrible
beauty
into
the
evening
i
can
not
say
why
islands
do
this
to
me
i
only
know
that
putting
out
into
the
open
gap
bound
for
the
mainland
is
like
loosing
hands
with
one
you
love
too
much
photogenic
it
must
be
nice
to
be
photogenic
to
not
have
to
get
in
to
a
panic
when
you
see
the
birdie
to
just
sit
there
smug
while
they
snap
your
mug
and
to
know
you
look
like
garbo
or
hedy
lamarr
in
the
finished
photo
not
moto
salad
bar
there
nothing
sadder
in
this
world
than
stale
stuffed
celery
in
the
swim
o
to
be
a
petty
gal
now
that
summer
here
with
thigh
and
breast
and
tawny
crest
and
slick
and
rear
to
lounge
against
the
gilded
sands
as
in
a
billboard
ad
while
some
adonis
thick
of
neck
a
great
athletic
cad
leans
over
one
with
tender
sigh
and
whispers
soft
and
low
the
company
who
made
your
suit
designed
these
trunks
you
know
adversary
she
stuck
her
little
hat
pin
in
and
gave
a
practiced
twist
the
only
thing
that
saves
my
pride
on
someone
with
a
tougher
hide
she
break
her
little
wrist
traitor
you
said
my
face
was
like
a
mask
a
little
white
unstirred
expanse
where
no
emotion
came
to
dance
you
said
my
eyes
were
secret
eyes
that
wore
a
mocking
shy
disguise
you
said
no
matter
how
you
try
your
mouth
betrays
you
by
and
by
sheepskin
an
education
used
to
be
a
thing
of
strict
gentility
with
classics
solid
as
a
rock
and
stresses
laid
on
culture
talk
now
when
he
graduates
a
man
must
just
make
money
with
élan
alien
o
i
am
homesick
every
day
for
places
i
shall
never
stay
for
tinkling
bells
in
samarkand
where
shadows
weave
a
saraband
and
london
streets
and
paris
nights
and
o
a
thousand
warm
delights
in
places
strange
and
far
from
here
and
naturellement
doubly
dear
cameo
i
ca
insult
my
heart
again
by
crying
over
gentlemen
but
rather
trot
it
out
to
tea
with
ladies
of
gentility
whose
talk
and
bread
sliced
neat
and
thin
will
lift
me
from
the
straits
i
in
renegade
part
of
me
is
sad
as
sad
and
part
of
me
is
glad
as
glad
part
of
me
is
pure
as
pure
and
part
of
me
i
not
so
sure
at
odds
within
myself
i
be
and
blame
it
on
my
family
tree
mask
you
may
make
your
mouth
up
scarlet
as
a
courtesan
thin
sophistication
lurks
in
scarlet
paint
even
masked
in
satire
still
your
eyes
betray
you
playing
tarnished
lady
funny
little
saint
if
this
be
good
if
this
be
good
then
it
shall
last
far
past
the
rasp
of
sexton
spade
far
past
the
snow
of
winter
laid
on
sleeping
garden
some
part
of
this
will
still
endure
on
time
wide
stream
some
single
sure
enchanted
moment
caught
up
in
space
will
shine
forever
and
in
my
heart
i
very
sure
which
little
moment
will
endure
disenchanted
they
always
say
be
good
sweet
child
and
let
who
will
be
clever
but
does
this
course
pay
dividends
i
answer
hardly
ever
figment
it
snowing
feathers
bits
of
maribou
from
some
very
frivolous
angel
unbiased
comment
small
furry
creatures
part
with
life
to
deck
each
plutocratic
wife
and
many
a
tender
throat
is
wrapt
in
silky
softness
someone
trapped
i
do
condemn
this
savage
rite
nor
wince
to
see
the
endless
sight
of
lovely
ladies
wrapt
in
fur
egad
i
only
wish
i
were
venomous
woman
she
has
avaricious
fingers
on
which
there
lingers
the
bitter
scent
of
almonds
poisonous
woman
how
her
nails
glitter
in
the
candlelight
only
her
eyes
suddenly
tear
you
apart
there
is
a
look
in
them
of
one
who
gazed
on
death
and
found
it
beautiful
bookshops
bookshops
have
a
lovely
smell
sweet
and
sour
heaven
and
hell
dust
and
mould
and
something
magic
laughter
cheek
by
jowl
with
tragic
songs
the
muses
used
to
sing
i
love
bookshops
in
the
spring
powder
room
at
every
little
crystal
square
grave
women
creatures
sit
and
stare
at
what
the
day
has
done
to
mar
frail
personal
beauty
puff
and
jar
and
lip
rouge
tubes
are
taken
out
to
dye
each
thoughtful
waiting
pout
no
hurried
smear
a
careful
rite
then
infinite
scansion
in
the
light
the
final
look
the
little
smile
triumphant
careful
full
of
guile
absorbed
completely
in
her
task
each
eve
adjusts
her
powdered
mask
bend
your
head
bend
your
head
and
kiss
my
hand
and
tell
me
tales
of
samarkand
weave
a
web
of
lovely
words
that
i
may
count
like
singing
birds
that
i
may
set
upon
my
sill
when
you
have
left
me
as
you
will
promise
i
shall
not
weep
when
you
go
but
don
a
scarlet
dress
and
i
shall
sing
a
gay
song
and
you
shall
never
guess
and
i
shall
dance
when
you
go
with
other
eager
men
and
make
my
heart
forget
you
and
you
shall
want
me
then
remnant
you
promised
me
fidelity
i
got
a
ring
i
got
a
vow
and
now
i
got
a
ring
aware
i
hope
i
never
quite
get
over
the
smell
of
rainy
summer
clover
or
how
a
willow
tree
at
night
can
make
a
silver
sort
of
light
or
how
a
child
with
lifted
face
can
make
a
holy
sort
of
place
out
of
loneliness
out
of
a
loneliness
more
deep
than
quiet
death
out
of
a
sleep
as
cold
as
ice
more
drear
more
chill
i
hunger
up
toward
dreaming
fill
my
hands
with
flowers
tread
a
measure
against
bright
candles
bare
my
throat
to
autumn
moonlight
cry
to
the
stars
that
love
rides
by
against
whatever
midnight
sky
chalk
talk
sometimes
i
tell
myself
chumley
it
about
time
you
acquired
a
little
dignity
not
much
just
a
touch
take
to
wearing
a
hat
and
the
like
of
that
quit
enjoying
the
society
of
youth
in
the
formative
stage
in
other
words
act
your
age
i
gone
into
this
subject
with
myself
before
but
it
such
a
bore
i
know
what
will
come
of
it
one
day
they
be
saying
what
a
silly
old
person
she
is
flighty
maybe
touched
in
the
head
and
will
my
face
be
red
but
i
fancy
in
the
final
analysis
we
follow
our
natural
bent
so
i
sha
relent
dignity
comes
to
us
all
dressed
in
a
shroud
forgive
if
just
for
a
little
i
laugh
aloud
on
the
assorted
people
sit
or
ride
forced
intimates
and
hide
to
hide
as
close
as
in
a
double
bed
they
touch
at
thigh
and
arm
and
head
and
then
get
off
and
go
away
to
ride
again
some
other
day
ode
if
this
is
spring
you
can
have
the
thing
old
hand
love
is
a
dream
and
love
is
pain
love
is
a
song
and
love
is
a
chain
but
love
is
a
thing
we
ca
forego
take
my
word
for
it
i
tried
i
know
observation
a
mermaid
was
a
fabled
sea
creature
but
beautiful
of
face
enchanting
heartless
half
woman
half
fish
do
you
know
i
looked
about
me
and
thought
of
how
many
women
are
really
mermaids
fall
fires
o
scudding
windy
day
you
snare
my
soul
and
fey
as
fey
i
wander
down
a
curving
street
to
scuff
the
leaves
against
my
feet
and
smell
the
smoke
that
curls
the
air
and
find
the
autumn
wondrous
fair
now
is
the
time
now
is
the
time
when
falling
snow
drifts
soft
as
flowerlets
far
below
the
dark
earth
stretching
in
her
sleep
is
full
of
secrets
children
keep
one
little
ear
above
each
cover
lest
in
the
night
they
might
discover
the
sound
of
hoofbeats
in
the
air
and
know
that
santa
claus
is
there
drawn
in
dust
on
a
table
top
tho
i
love
to
be
neat
i
admit
defeat
some
women
shoes
are
on
racks
mine
are
in
stacks
i
can
never
find
a
needle
or
pin
they
never
in
what
i
put
them
in
and
when
i
emerge
in
confusion
from
this
rudderless
fog
i
closely
resemble
a
something
you
find
under
a
log
be
good
be
good
my
child
the
sages
said
and
packed
me
off
to
early
bed
i
did
mind
when
i
was
small
and
never
loitered
in
the
hall
but
climbed
the
stair
and
clicked
the
light
and
closed
my
eyes
against
the
night
but
now
upon
the
sill
i
lean
and
feel
the
wind
across
my
throat
and
tremble
when
the
moon
is
new
and
watch
the
stars
the
whole
night
through
for
love
has
set
his
sign
on
me
and
i
am
neither
young
nor
free
camouflage
i
said
i
will
sing
you
a
song
in
the
night
how
your
eves
wear
desire
and
your
voice
holds
delight
but
i
sing
it
so
softly
you
never
believe
that
this
thing
is
my
heart
that
i
wear
on
my
sleeve
observation
to
find
an
oyster
in
a
seafood
salad
is
quite
a
surprise
to
the
average
palad
sixteen
how
can
a
guy
absorb
this
knowledge
and
get
himself
ready
for
ruddy
college
how
can
he
concentrate
at
all
when
he
just
passed
a
dream
in
the
upper
hall
hush
there
is
an
hour
when
earth
and
sky
merge
in
the
twilight
with
a
sort
of
sigh
trees
touch
the
skyline
birds
the
earth
and
stars
are
shaken
with
twinkling
mirth
and
it
just
as
well
if
you
all
alone
to
plug
the
line
of
your
telephone
first
snow
just
a
thin
flurry
but
the
first
snow
always
exciting
full
of
pictures
overstockings
of
red
wool
mittens
to
match
and
a
toboggan
cap
with
a
bob
on
it
bruised
thumbs
from
struggling
with
tight
overshoes
a
plaid
kilt
with
a
green
velveteen
jacket
and
a
real
lace
collar
a
teacher
face
slightly
harried
bending
over
solicitous
buttons
the
beautiful
breathlessness
of
the
first
belly
flop
on
the
small
red
sleigh
just
a
thin
flurry
but
the
first
snow
mirror
i
looked
in
a
mirror
and
all
i
saw
was
the
pitiless
scar
of
time
sharp
claw
but
over
a
candle
i
looked
in
your
eyes
and
there
reflected
to
my
surprise
was
a
lovely
person
unflawed
soignée
so
you
be
my
mirror
after
portrait
she
sure
of
herself
safe
as
the
mint
and
her
soul
is
made
of
flowered
print
