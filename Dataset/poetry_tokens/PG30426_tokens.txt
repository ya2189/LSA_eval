preface
in
making
this
little
collection
my
aim
has
been
to
bring
together
rhymes
old
and
new
which
for
the
greater
part
are
not
included
in
other
books
for
the
nursery
or
schoolroom
some
of
the
old
friends
appear
with
local
variations
many
of
the
others
have
been
repeated
to
me
by
people
who
do
not
know
whence
they
come
and
indeed
in
many
cases
it
has
been
impossible
to
discover
the
authors
i
have
done
my
best
to
avoid
infringing
copyrights
but
should
i
have
inadvertently
done
so
i
hope
my
humble
apologies
will
be
accepted

a

and

one
night
sailed
off
in
a
wooden
shoe
sailed
on
a
river
of
crystal
light
into
a
sea
of
dew
where
are
you
going
and
what
do
you
wish
we
have
come
to
fish
for
the
that
live
in
this
beautiful
sea
nets
of
silver
and
gold
have
we
said
wynken
blynken
and
nod
the
old
man
laughed
and
sang
a
song
as
they
rocked
in
the
wooden
shoe
and
the
wind
that
sped
them
all
night
long
ruffled
the
waves
of
dew
the
little
stars
were
the
that
lived
in
that
beautiful
sea
now
cast
your
nets
wherever
you
wish
never
afeared
are
we
so
cried
the
stars
to
the
fishermen
three
wynken
blynken
and
nod
all
night
long
their
nets
they
threw
to
the
stars
in
the
twinkling
foam
then
down
from
the
skies
came
the
wooden
shoe
bringing
the
fishermen
home
was
all
so
pretty
a
sail
it
seemed
as
if
it
be
and
some
folk
thought
was
a
dream
they
dreamed
of
sailing
that
beautiful
sea
but
i
shall
name
you
the
fishermen
three
wynken
blynken
and
nod
wynken
and
blynken
are
two
little
eyes
and
nod
is
a
little
head
and
the
wooden
shoe
that
sailed
the
skies
is
a
wee
one
so
shut
your
eyes
while
mother
sings
of
wonderful
sights
that
be
and
you
shall
see
the
beautiful
things
as
you
rock
in
the
misty
sea
where
the
old
shoe
rocked
the
fishermen
three
wynken
blynken
and
nod
o

dear
babie
to
thee
o
fear
not
the
bugle
though
loudly
it
blows
it
calls
but
the
warders
that
guard
thy
repose
their
bows
would
be
bended
their
blades
would
be
red
the
step
of
a
foeman
draws
near
to
thy
bed
o
hush

puts
his
head

leg
he
perches

soon
he
lies
beneath

little

around

look

come
and
carry
this
very
foolish
little
harry
the
little
birds
are
better
taught
they
go
to
roosting
when
they
ought
and
all
the
ducks
and
fowls
you
know
they
went
to
bed
an
hour
ago
the
little
beggar
in
the
street
who
wanders
with
his
naked
feet
and
has
no
where
to
lay
his
head
oh
he
be
glad
to
go
to
bed
my
child
when
we
were
children
two
children
little
and
gay
we
crept
into
the
and
hid
behind
the
hay
we
crowed
as
doth
the
cock
crow
when
people
passed
that
road
cried
they
thought
the
cock
had
crowed
the
chests
that
lay
in
the
court
we
papered
and
made
so
clean
and
dwelt
therein
together
we
thought
them
fit
for
a
queen
oft
came
our
neighbour
old
cat
with
us
an
hour
to
spend
we
made
her
curtseys
and
bows
and
compliments
without
end
there
was
one
little
jim
is
reported
of
him
and
must
be
to
his
lasting
disgrace
that
he
never
was
seen
with
his
hands
at
all
clean
nor
yet
ever
clean
was
his
face
his
friends
were
much
hurt
to
see
so
much
dirt
and
often
they
made
him
quite
clean
but
all
was
in
vain
he
was
dirty
again
and
not
at
all
fit
to
be
seen
when
to
wash
he
was
sent
he
reluctantly
went
with
water
to
splash
himself
but
he
seldom
was
seen
to
have
washed
himself
clean
and
often
looked
worse
than
before
the
idle
and
bad
like
this
little
lad
may
be
dirty
and
black
to
be
sure
but
good
boys
are
seen
to
be
decent
and
clean
although
they
are
ever
so
poor
cleanliness
come
my
little
robert
near
fie
what
filthy
hands
are
here
who
that
could
understand
the
rare
structure
of
a
hand
with
its
branching
fingers
fine
work
itself
of
hands
divine
strong
yet
delicately
knit
for
ten
thousand
uses
fit
overlaid
with
so
clear
skin
you
may
see
the
blood
within
who
this
hand
would
choose
to
cover
with
a
crust
of
dirt
all
over
till
it
looked
in
hue
and
shape
like
the
forefoot
of
an
ape
man
or
boy
that
works
or
plays
in
the
fields
or
the
highways
may
without
offence
or
hurt
from
the
soil
contract
a
dirt
which
the
next
clear
spring
or
river
washes
out
and
out
for
ever
but
to
cherish
stains
impure
soil
deliberate
to
endure
on
the
skin
to
fix
a
stain
till
it
works
into
the
grain
argues
a
degenerate
mind
sordid
slothful
wanting
in
that
which
doth
virtue
best
protect
cleanliness
virtue
next
to
godliness
easiest
cheapest
duty
to
the
body
health
and
beauty
who
that
human
would
refuse
it
when
a
little
water
does
it
little
willie
from
his
mirror
sucked
the
mercury
all
off
thinking
in
his
childish
error
it
would
cure
his
at
the
funeral
willie
mother
smartly
said
to
mrs
brown
was
a
chilly
day
for
william
when
the
mercury
went
down
ah

said
willie
mother
oh
oh

said
mrs
brown
was
a
chilly
day
for
william
when
the
mercury
went
down
feigned
courage
horatio
of
ideal
courage
vain
was
flourishing
in
air
his
father
cane
and
as
the
fumes
of
valour
swelled
his
pate
now
thought
himself
this
hero
and
now
that
and
now
he
cried
i
will
achilles
be
my
sword
i
brandish
see
the
trojans
flee
now
i
be
hector
when
his
angry
blade
a
lane
through
heaps
of
slaughter
grecians
made
and
now
my
deeds
still
braver
i
evince
i
am
no
less
than
edward
the
black
prince
give
way
ye
coward
french
as
this
he
spoke
and
aim
in
fancy
a
sufficient
stroke
to
fix
the
fate
of
cressy
or
poitiers
the
muse
relates
the
hero
fate
with
tears
he
struck
his
hand
against
a
nail
sees
his
own
blood
and
feels
his
courage
fail
ah
where
is
now
that
boasted
valour
flown
that
in
the
tented
field
so
late
was
shown
achilles
weeps
great
hector
hangs
his
head
and
the
black
prince
goes
whimpering
to
bed
on
reading

how

oh
we
have
had
a
sad
mishap
as
clara
lay
in
nurse
lap
too
near
the
fire
the
chair
did
stand
a
coal
flew
out
and
burnt
her
hand
it
must
have
flown
above
the
guard
it
came
so
quick
and
hit
so
hard
and
would
you
think
it
raised
a
blister
oh
how
she
cried
poor
little
sister
poor
thing
i
grieved
to
see
it
swell
what
will
you
do
to
make
it
well
why
said
mamma
i
really
think
some
scraped
potato
or
some
ink
a
little
vinegar
or
brandy
whichever
nurse
can
find
most
handy
all
these
are
good
my
little
daughter
but
nothing
better
than
cold
water
rebellious
frances
the
babe
was
in
the
cradle
laid
and
tom
had
said
his
prayers
when
frances
told
the
she
would
not
go
upstairs
she
cried
so
loud
her
mother
came
to
ask
the
reason
why
and
said
oh
frances
fie
for
shame
oh
fie
oh
fie
oh
fie
but
frances
was
more
naughty
still
and
betty
sadly
nipp
until
her
mother
said
i
will
i
must
have
frances
whipp
for
oh
how
naughty
is
to
cry
but
worse
much
worse
to
fight
instead
of
running
readily
and
calling
out
poisonous
fruit
as
tommy
and
his
sister
jane
were
walking
down
a
shady
lane
they
saw
some
berries
bright
and
red
that
hung
around
and
overhead
and
soon
the
bough
they
bended
down
to
make
the
scarlet
fruit
their
own
and
part
they
ate
and
part
in
play
they
threw
about
and
flung
away
but
long
they
had
not
been
at
home
before
poor
jane
and
little
tom
were
taken
sick
and
ill
to
bed
and
since
i
heard
they
both
are
dead
alas
had
tommy
understood
that
fruit
in
lanes
is
seldom
good
he
might
have
walked
with
little
jane
again
along
the
shady
lane

the

on
a
market
day
i
met
the
finest
ram
sir
that
ever
was
fed
upon
hay
this
ram
was
fat
behind
sir
this
ram
was
fat
before
this
ram
was
ten
yards
high
sir
indeed
he
was
no
more
etc
the
wool
upon
his
back
sir
reached
up
unto
the
sky
the
eagles
made
their
nests
there
sir
i
heard
the
young
ones
cry
etc
the
wool
upon
his
belly
sir
it
dragged
upon
the
ground
it
was
sold
in
derby
town
sir
for
forty
thousand
pound
etc
the
space
between
his
horns
sir
was
as
far
as
a
man
could
reach
and
there
they
built
a
pulpit
sir
for
the
parson
there
to
preach
etc
the
teeth
that
were
in
his
mouth
sir
were
like
a
regiment
of
men
and
the
tongue
that
hung
between
them
sir
would
have
dined
them
twice
and
again
etc
this
ram
jumped
a
wall
sir
his
tail
caught
on
a
briar
it
reached
from
derby
town
sir
all
into
leicestershire
etc
and
of
this
tail
so
long
sir
was
ten
miles
and
an
ell
they
made
a
goodly
rope
sir
to
toll
the
market
bell
etc
this
ram
had
four
legs
to
walk
sir
this
ram
had
four
legs
to
stand
and
every
leg
he
had
sir
stood
on
an
acre
of
land
etc
the
butcher
that
killed
this
ram
sir
was
drowned
in
the
blood
and
all
the
good
people
of
derby
sir
were
carried
away
in
the
flood
etc
all
the
maids
in
derby
sir
came
begging
for
his
horns
to
take
them
to
the
cooper
sir
to
make
them
milking
gawns
etc
the
little
boys
of
derby
sir
they
came
to
beg
his
eyes
to
kick
about
the
streets
sir
for
they
were
football
size
etc
the
tanner
that
tanned
his
hide
sir
would
never
be
poor
any
more
for
when
he
had
tanned
and
stretched
it
sir
it
covered
all
sinfin
moor

here
is
puss
in
the
study
how
cunning
she
looks
she
likes
rats
and
mice
far
better
than
books
ah
that
poor
little
mouse
it
is
out
of
its
pain
and
will
never
feel
pussy
sharp

again
i
hope
it
has
not
left
some
young
ones
at
home
who
with
hunger
may
die
ere
their
mother
shall
come
and
yet
be
wrong
to
say
puss
is
not
good
for
the
rats
and
the
mice
you
know
serve
her
for
food
and
though
we
may
pity
the
poor
little
mice
yet
we
do
like
to
lose
our
cheese
butter
and
rice
the
cow
most
parts
of
the
cow
are
useful
and
good
for
leather
for
lanthorns
for
candles
or
food
and
before
she
is
dead
we
owe
much
to
the
cow
her
uses
are
great
let
us
think
of
them
now
every
morning
and
evening
how
quiet
she
stands
when
the
farmer
boy
comes
stool
and
pail
in
his
hands
and
when
he
returns
with
the
milk
fresh
and
sweet
to
most
little
children
it
proves
a
great
treat
mama
likes
the
cream
to
put
into
the
tea
and
to
make
us
nice
puddings
some
milk
there
must
be
then
from
milk
we
have
butter
and
cheese
too
you
know
so
that
all
these
good
things
we
receive
from
the
cow
the
cow
has
a
horn
and
the
fish
has
a
gill
the
horse
has
a
hoof
and
the
duck
has
a
bill
the
bird
has
a
wing
that
on
high
he
may
sail
and
the
lion
a
mane
and
the
monkey
a
tail
and
they
swim
or
they
fly
or
they
walk
or
they
eat
with
fin
or
with
wing
or
with
bill
or
with
feet
and
charles
has
two
hands
with
five
fingers
to
each
on
purpose
to
hold
with
to
work
and
to
reach
no
birds
beasts
or
fishes
for
work
or
for
play

anything
half
so
convenient
as

do
use
them
and
keep
them
in
use

better
have
had
