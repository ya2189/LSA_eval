here
it
is
spring
again
and
i
still
a
young
man
i
am
late
at
my
singing
the
sparrow
with
the
black
rain
on
his
breast
has
been
at
his
cadenzas
for
two
weeks
past
what
is
it
that
is
dragging
at
my
heart
the
grass
by
the
back
door
is
stiff
with
sap

old
maples
are
opening
their
branches
of
brown
and
yellow
a

hangs
in

blue
in

i

march
i
winter
is
long
in
this
climate
and
spring
a
matter
of
a
few
days
only
a
flower
or
two
picked
from
mud
or
from
among
wet
leaves
or
at
best
against
treacherous
bitterness
of
wind
and
sky
shining
teasingly
then
closing
in
black
and
sudden
with
fierce
jaws
ii
march
you
remind
me
of
the
pyramids
our
pyramids
stript
of
the
polished
stone
that
used
to
guard
them
march
you
are
like
fra
angelico
at
fiesole
painting
on
plaster
march
you
are
like
a
band
of
young
poets
that
have
not
learned
the
blessedness
of
warmth
or
have
forgotten
it
at
any
rate
i
am
moved
to
write
poetry
for
the
warmth
there
is
in
it
and
for
the
loneliness
a
poem
that
shall
have
you
in
it

see
the
archer
king
on
in
blue
and
yellow
enamel
with
drawn
bow
facing
lions
standing
on

hind
legs

bared
his
shafts
bristling
in
their
necks
sacred
bulls
dragons
in
embossed
brickwork
marching
in
four
tiers
along

sacred
way
to
nebuchadnezzar

they
shine
in
the
sun
they
that
have
been
marching
marching
under
the
dust
of
ten
thousand
dirt
years
now
they
are
coming
into
bloom
again
see
them
marching
still
bared
by
the
storms
from
my
calendar
winds
that
blow
back
the
sand
winds
that
enfilade
dirt
winds
that
by
strange
craft
have
whipt
up
a
black
army
that
by
pick
and
shovel
bare
a
procession
to
the
god
marduk
natives
cursing
and
digging
for

unearth
dragons
with
upright

and

iv
my
second
spring
passed
in
a
monastery
with
plaster
walls
in
fiesole
on
the
hill
above
florence
my
second
spring
painted
a
virgin
in
a
blue
aureole
sitting
on
a
stool
arms
crossed
she
is
intently
serious
and
still
watching
an
angel
with
coloured
wings
half
kneeling
before
her
and
smiling
the
angel
eyes
holding
the
eyes
of
mary
as
a
snake
holds
a
bird
on
the
ground
there
are
flowers
trees
are
in
leaf
v
but
now
for
the
battle
now
for
murder
now
for
the
real
thing
my
third
springtime
is
approaching
winds
lean
serious
as
a
virgin
seeking
seeking
the
flowers
of
march
seeking
flowers
nowhere
to
be
found
they
twine
among
the
bare
branches
in
insatiable
eagerness
they
whirl
up
the
snow
seeking
under
it
they
the
winds
snakelike
roar
among
yellow
reeds
seeking
flowers
flowers
i
spring
among
them
seeking
one
flower
in
which
to
warm
myself
i
deride
with
all
the
ridicule
of
misery
my
own
starved
misery
winds
strike
against
me
refreshing
their
fury
come
good
cold
fellows
have
we
no
flowers
defy
then
with
even
more
desperation
than
ever
being
lean
and
frozen
but
though
you
are
lean
and
frozen
think
of
the
blue
bulls
of
babylon
fling
yourselves
upon
their
empty
roses
cut
savagely
but
think
of
the
painted
monastery
at
fiesole
berket
and
the
stars
a
day
on
the
boulevards
chosen
out
of
ten
years
of
student
poverty
one
best
day
out
of
ten
good
ones
berket
in
high
spirits
ha
oranges
let
have
one
and
he
made
to
snatch
an
orange
from
the
vender
cart
now
so
clever
was
the
deception
so
nicely
timed
to
the
full
sweep
of
certain
wave
summits
that
the
rumor
of
the
thing
has
come
down
through
three
generations
which
is
relatively
forever
a
celebration
a
march
now
as
always
gusts
from
the
south
broken
against
cold
winds
but
from
under
as
if
a
slow
hand
lifted
a
tide
it
moves
not
into
april
into
a
second
march
the
old
skin
of
scales
dropping
upon
the
mould
this
is
the
shadow
projects
the
tree
upward
causing
the
sun
to
shine
in
his
sphere
so
we
will
put
on
our
pink
felt
hat
new
last
year
newer
this
by
virtue
of
brown
eyes
turning
back
the
seasons
and
let
us
walk
to
the
see
the
flowers
will
take
the
prize
at
the
palace
stop
here
these
are
our
oleanders
when
they
are
in
bloom
you
would
waste
words
it
is
clearer
to
me
than
if
the
pink
were
on
the
branch
it
would
be
a
searching
in
a
coloured
cloud
to
reveal
that
which
now
huskless
shows
the
very
reason
for
their
being
and
these
the
in
blossom
no
need
to
tell
with
this
weight
of
perfume
in
the
air
if
it
were
not
so
dark
in
this
shed
one
could
better
see
the
white
it
is
that
very
perfume
has
drawn
the
darkness
down
among
the
leaves
do
i
speak
clearly
enough
it
is
this
darkness
reveals
that
which
darkness
alone
loosens
and
sets
spinning
on
waxen
wings
not
the
touch
of
a
not
the
motion
of
a
sigh
a
too
heavy
sweetness
proves
its
own
caretaker
and
here
are
the
orchids
never
having
seen
such
gaiety
i
will
read
these
flowers
for
you
this
is
an
odd
january
died
in
villon
time
snow
this
is
and
this
the
stain
of
a
violet
grew
in
that
place
the
spring
that
foresaw
its
own
doom
and
this
a
certain
july
from
iceland
a
young
woman
of
that
place
breathed
it
toward
the
south
it
took
root
there
the
colour
ran
true
but
the
plant
is
small
this
falling
spray
of
snowflakes
is
a
handful
of
dead
februarys
prayed
into
flower
by
rafael
arevalo
martinez
of
guatemala
here
that
old
friend
who
went
by
my
side
so
many
years
this
full
fragile
head
of
veined
lavender
oh
that
april
that
we
first
went
with
our
stiff
lusts
leaving
the
city
behind
out
to
the
green
hill
may
they
said
she
was
a
hand
for
all
of
us
this
branch
of
blue
butterflies
tied
to
this
stem
june
is
a
yellow
cup
i
not
name
august
the
one
and
here
are
russet
and
shiny
all
but
march
and
march
ah
march
flowers
are
a
tiresome
pastime
one
has
a
wish
to
shake
them
from
their
pots
root
and
stern
for
the
sun
to
gnaw
walk
out
again
into
the
cold
and
saunter
home
to
the
fire
this
day
has
blossomed
long
enough
i
have
wiped
out
the
red
night
and
lit
a
blaze
instead
which
will
at
least
warm
our
hands
and
stir
up
the
talk
i
think
we
have
kept
fair
time
time
is
a
green
orchid
april
if
you
had
come
away
with
me
into
another
state
we
had
been
quiet
together
but
there
the
sun
coming
up
out
of
the
nothing
beyond
the
lake
was
too
low
in
the
sky
there
was
too
great
a
pushing
against
him
too
much
of
sumac
buds
pink
in
the
head
with
the
clear
gum
upon
them
too
many
opening
hearts
of
lilac
leaves
too
many
too
many
swollen
limp
poplar
tassels
on
the
bare
branches
it
was
too
strong
in
the
air
i
had
no
rest
against
that
springtime
the
pounding
of
the
hoofs
on
the
raw
sods
stayed
with
me
half
through
the
night
i
awoke
smiling
but
tired
a
goodnight
go
to
sleep
though
of
course
you
will
not
to
tideless
waves
thundering
slantwise
against
strong
embankments
rattle
and
swish
of
spray
dashed
thirty
feet
high
caught
by
the
lake
wind
scattered
and
strewn
broadcast
in
over
the
steady
car
rails
sleep
sleep
gulls
cries
in
a
broken
by
the
wind
calculating
wings
set
above
the
field
of
waves
breaking
go
to
sleep
to
the
lunge
between
refuse
churned
in
the
recoil
food
food
offal
offal
that
holds
them
in
the
air
for
the
one
purpose
feather
upon
feather
the
wild
chill
in
their
eyes
the
hoarseness
in
their
voices
sleep
sleep
gentlefooted
crowds
are
treading
out
your
lullaby
their
arms
nudge
they
brush
shoulders
hitch
this
way
then
that
mass
and
surge
at
the
crossings
lullaby
lullaby
the
police
whistles
the
enraged
roar
of
the
traffic
machine
shrieks
it
is
all
to
put
you
to
sleep
to
soften
your
limbs
in
relaxed
postures
and
that
your
head
slip
sidewise
and
your
hair
loosen
and
fall
over
your
eyes
and
over
your
mouth
brushing
your
lips
wistfully
that
you
may
dream
sleep
and
dream
a
black
fungus
springs
out
about
lonely
church
doors
sleep
sleep
the
night
coming
down
upon
the
wet
boulevard
would
start
you
awake
with
his
message
to
have
in
at
your
window
pay
no
heed
to
him
he
storms
at
your
sill
with
cooings
with
gesticulations
curses
you
will
not
let
him
in
he
would
keep
you
from
sleeping
he
would
have
you
sit
under
your
desk
lamp
brooding
pondering
he
would
have
you
slide
out
the
drawer
take
up
the
ornamented
dagger
and
handle
it
it
is
late
it
is
go
to
sleep
his
cries
are
a
lullaby
his
jabbering
is
a
he
is
a
crackbrained
messenger
the
maid
waking
you
in
the
morning
when
you
are
up
and
dressing
the
rustle
of
your
clothes
as
you
raise
them
it
is
the
same
tune
at
table
the
cold
greenish
split
grapefruit
its
juice
on
the
tongue
the
clink
of
the
spoon
in
your
coffee
the
toast
odors
say
it
over
and
over
the
open
lets
in
the
breath
of
the
morning
wind
from
over
the
lake
the
bus
coming
to
a
halt
grinds
from
its
sullen
brakes

willow
poem
it
is
a
willow
when
summer
is
over
a
willow
by
the
river
from
which
no
leaf
has
fallen
nor
bitten
by
the
sun
turned
orange
or
crimson
the
leaves
cling
and
grow
paler
swing
and
grow
paler
over
the
swirling
waters
of
the
river
as
if
loath
to
let
go
they
are
so
cool
so
drunk
with
the
swirl
of
the
wind
and
of
the
river
oblivious
to
winter
the
last
to
let
go
and
fall
into
the
water
and
on
the
ground
approach
of
winter
the
half
stripped
trees
struck
by
a
wind
together
bending
all
the
leaves
flutter
drily
and
refuse
to
let
go
or
driven
like
hail
stream
bitterly
out
to
one
side
and
fall
where
the

hard

i

the

you
batter

its

years
of

following
hours
that
float
idly
down

its

for

eh
then
the
sun
a
clutter
of
yellow
and
blue
flakes
hairy
looking
trees
stand
out
in
long
alleys
over
a
wild
solitude
the
man
turns
and
there
his
solitary
track
stretched
out
upon
the
world
to
waken
an
old
lady
old
age
is
a
flight
of
small
cheeping
birds
skimming
bare
trees
above
a
snow
glaze
gaining
and
failing
they
are
buffetted
by
a
dark
wind
but
what
on
harsh
weedstalks
the
flock
has
rested
the
snow
is
covered
with
broken
seedhusks
and
the
wind
tempered
by
a
shrill
piping
of
plenty
winter
trees
all
the
complicated
details
of
the
attiring
and
the
disattiring
are
completed
a
liquid
moon
moves
gently
among
the
long
branches
thus
having
prepared
their
buds
against
a
sure
winter
the
wise
trees
stand
sleeping
in
the
cold
complaint
they
call
me
and
i
go
it
is
a
frozen

dust
of
snow
caught
in
the
rigid

the

opens
i
smile
enter
and
shake
off
the
cold
here
is
a
great
woman
on
her
side
in
the

she
is
sick
perhaps
vomiting
perhaps
laboring

give

to

night
is
a

darkened
for

through
the
jalousies
the
sun
has
sent
one
gold
needle
i
pick
the
hair
from
her
eyes
and
watch
her
misery
with
compassion
the
cold
night
it
is
cold
the
white
moon
is
up
among
her
scattered
stars
like
the
bare
thighs
of
the
police
seargent
wife
among
her
five
children
no
answer
pale
shadows
lie
upon
the
frosted
grass
one
answer
it
is
midnight
it
is
still
and
it
is
cold
white
thighs
of
the
sky
a
new
answer
out
of
the
depths
of
my
male
belly
in
april
in
april
i
shall
see
again
in
april
the
round
and
perfect
thighs
of
the
police
sergent
wife
perfect
still
after
many
babies
oya
spring
storm
the
sky
has
given
over
its
bitterness
out
of
the
dark
change
all
day
long
rain
falls
and
falls
as
if
it
would
never
end
still
the
snow
keeps
its
hold
on
the
ground
but
water
water
from
a
thousand
runnels
it
collects
swiftly
dappled
with
black
cuts
a
way
for
itself
through
green
ice
in
the
gutters
drop
after
drop
it
falls
from
the
withered
of
the
overhanging
embankment
the
delicacies
the
hostess
in
pink
satin
and
blond
hair
dressed
high
shone
beautifully
in
her
white
slippers
against
the
great
silent
bald
head
of
her
husband
raising
a
glass
of
yellow
rhine
wine
in
the
narrow
space
just
beyond
the
woodwork
and
the
decorative
column
between
and
hall
she
smiled
the
smile
of
water
tumbling
from
one
ledge
to
another
we
began
with
a
herring
salad
delicately
flavoured
saltiness
in
scallops
of
the
little
and
lady
with
masses
of
grey
hair
has
smooth
pink
cheeks
without
a

she
can
not
be
the
daughter
of
the
little
fellow
dancing
about
inviting

the
druggist
to
play
the
piano
but
she
is
wolff
is
a
terrific
smoker
if
the
telephone
goes
off
at
night
so
his
wife
whispers
he
rises
from

but
can
not
answer
till
he
has
lighted
a

in

my

is
young
yes
she
is
young
and
pretty
when
she
cares
to
be
when
she
is
interested
in
a
discussion
it
is
the
little
dancing
mayor
wife
telling
her
of
the
day
nursery
in
east
rutherford
the
track
divided
from
us
by
the

and
disputes
as
to
precedence
it

in
this

the
saloon
of
my
friend
on
the
right
whose
wife
has
twice
offended
with
chance
words
her
english
is
atrocious
it
is
in
this
town
that
the
saloon
is
situated
close
to
the
railroad
track
close
as
may
be
this
side

dry
dry

people
listening
on
opposite

of

babies
the
week
before
last
so
my

eyes
shine
and
her
cheeks
are
pink
and
i
can
not
see
a
blemish
in
the
shape
of
flowers
and
domestic
objects
a
pipe
for
me
since
i
do
not
smoke
a
doll
for
you
the
figure
of
some
great
bulk
of
a
woman
disappearing
into
the
kitchen
with
a
quick
look
over
the
shoulder
my
friend
on
the
left
who
has
spent
the
whole
day
in
a
car
the
like
of
which
some
old
fellow
would
give
to
an
actress
mirrors

my

on

who
is
chairman
of
the

thursday
i
have
had
my
dream
like
others
and
it
has
come
to
nothing
so
that
i
remain
now
carelessly
with
feet
planted
on
the
ground
and
look
up
at
the

feeling
my
clothes
about
me
the
weight
of
my

in
my

the
rim
of
my

air
passing
in

out
at

decide
to
dream
no

you

as

must
one
become

older
it
seems

as
if

tripped
up

let

see
let
us
see
what
did
i
plan
to
say
to
her
when
it
should
happen
to
me

it
has
happened
now
the

locked

arms
seem
still
so
that
squirrels

go
about
at

over
the
branches
and
through
the
air
where
will
a
shoulder
split
or
a
forehead
open
and
victory
be
nowhere
both
sides
grow
older
and
you
may
be
sure
not
one
leaf
will
lift
itself
from
the
ground
and
become
fast
to
a
twig
again
arrival
and
yet
one
arrives
somehow
finds
himself
loosening
the
hooks
of
her
dress
in
a
strange
bedroom
feels
the
autumn
dropping
its
silk
and
linen
leaves
about
her
ankles
the
tawdry
veined
body
emerges
twisted
upon
itself
like
a
winter
wind
to
a
friend
concerning
several
ladies
you
know
there
is
not
much
that
i
desire
a
few
crysanthemums
half
lying
on
the
grass
yellow
and
brown
and
white
the
talk
of
a
few
people
the
trees
an
expanse
of
dried
leaves
perhaps
with
ditches
among
them
but
there
comes
between
me
and
these
things
a
letter
or
even
a
look
well
placed
you
understand
so
that
i
am
confused
twisted
four
ways
and
left
flat
unable
to
lift
the
food
to
my
own
mouth
here
is
what
they
say
come
and
come
and
come
and
if
i
do
not
go
i
remain
stale
to
myself
and
if
i
go
i
have
watched
the
city
from
a
distance
at
night
and
wondered
why
i
wrote
no
poem
come
yes
the
city
is
ablaze
for
you
and
you
stand
and
look
at
it
and
they
are
right
there
is
no
good
in
the
world
except
out
of
a
woman
and
certain
women
alone
for
certain
things
but
what
if
i
arrive
like
a
turtle
with
my
house
on
my
back
or
a
fish
ogling
from
under
water
it
will
not
do
i
must
be
steaming
with
love
colored
like
a
flamingo
for
what
to
have
legs
and
a
silly
head
and
to
smell
pah
like
a
flamingo
that
soils
its
own
feathers
behind
must
i
go
home
filled
with
a
bad
poem
and
they
say
who
can
answer
these
things
till
he
has
tried
your
eyes
are
half
closed
you
are
a
child
oh
a
sweet
one
ready
to
play
but
i
will
make
a
man
of
you
and
with
love
on
his
shoulder
and
in
the
marshes
the
crickets
run
on
the
sunny
dike
top
and
make
burrows
there
the
water
reflects
the
reeds
and
the
reeds
move
on
their
stalks
and
rattle
drily
youth
and
beauty
i
bought
a
dishmop
having
no
daughter
for
they
had
twisted
fine
ribbons
of
shining
copper
about
white
twine
and
made
a
towsled
head
of
it
fastened
it
upon
a
turned
ash
stick
slender
at
the
neck
straight
tall
when
tied
upright
on
the
brass
wallbracket
to
be
a
light
for
me
and
naked
as
a
girl
should
seem
to
her
father
the
thinker
my
wife
new
pink
slippers
have
gay
there
is
not
a
spot
or
a
stain
on
their
satin
toes
or
their
sides
all
night
they
lie
together
under
her
bed
edge
shivering
i
catch
sight
of
them
and
smile
in
the
morning
later
i
watch
them
descending
the
stair
hurrying
through
the
doors
and
round
the
table
moving
stiffly
with
a
shake
of
their
gay
and
i
talk
to
them
in
my
secret
mind
out
of
pure
happiness
the
disputants
upon
the
table
in
their
bowl
in
violent
disarray
of
yellow
sprays
green
spikes
of
leaves
red
pointed
petals
and
curled
heads
of
blue
and
white
among
the
litter
of
the
forks
and
crumbs
and
plates
the
flowers
remain
composed
cooly
their
colloquy
continues
above
the
coffee
and
loud
talk
grown
frail
as
vaudeville
tulip
bed
the
may
sun
whom
all
things
imitate
that
glues
small
leaves
to
the
wooden
trees
shone
from
the
sky
through
bluegauze
clouds
upon
the
ground
under
the
leafy
trees
where
the
suburban
streets
lay
crossed
with
houses
on
each
corner
tangled
shadows
had
begun
to
join
the
roadway
and
the
lawns
with
excellent
precision
the
tulip
bed
inside
the
iron
fence
upreared
its
gaudy
yellow
white
and
red
rimmed
round
with
grass
reposedly
the
birds
the
world
begins
again
not
wholly
insufflated
the
blackbirds
in
the
rain
upon
the
dead
topbranches
of
the
living
tree
stuck
fast
to
the
low
clouds
notate
the
dawn
their
shrill
cries
sound
announcing
appetite
and
drop
among
the
bending
roses
and
the
dripping
grass
the
nightingales
my
shoes
as
i
lean
unlacing
them
stand
out
upon
flat
worsted
flowers
under
my
feet
nimbly
the
shadows
of
my
fingers
play
unlacing
over
shoes
and
flowers
spouts
in
this
world
of
as
fine
a
pair
of
breasts
as
ever
i
saw
the
fountain
in
madison
square
spouts
up
of
water
a
white
tree
that
dies
and
lives
as
the
rocking
water
in
the
basin
turns
from
the
stonerim
back
upon
the
jet
and
rising
there
reflectively
drops
down
again
blueflags
i
stopped
the
car
to
let
the
children
down
where
the
streets
end
in
the
sun
at
the
marsh
edge
and
the
reeds
begin
and
there
are
small
houses
facing
the
reeds
and
the
blue
mist
in
the
distance
with
grapevine
trellises
with
grape
clusters
small
as
strawberries
on
the
vines
and
ditches
running
springwater
that
continue
the
gutters
with
willows
over
them
the
reeds
begin
like
water
at
a
shore
their
pointed
petals
waving
dark
green
and
light
but
blueflags
are
blossoming
in
the
reeds
which
the
children
pluck
chattering
in
the
reeds
high
over
their
heads
which
they
part
with
bare
arms
to
appear
with
fists
of
flowers
till
in
the
air
there
comes
the
smell
of
calamus
from
wet
gummy
stalks
the
widow
lament
in
springtime
sorrow
is
my
own
yard
where
the
new
grass
flames
as
it
has
flamed
often
before
but
not
with
the
cold
fire
that
closes
round
me
this
year
thirtyfive
years
i
lived
with
my
husband
the
plumtree
is
white
today
with
masses
of
flowers
masses
of
flowers
load
the
cherry
branches
and
color
some
bushes
yellow
and
some
red
but
the
grief
in
my
heart
is
stronger
than
they
for
though
they
were
my
joy
formerly
today
i
notice
them
and
turn
away
forgetting
today
my
son
told
me
that
in
the
meadows
at
the
edge
of
the
heavy
woods
in
the
distance
he
saw
trees
of
white
flowers
i
feel
that
i
would
like
to
go
there
and
fall
into
those
flowers
and
sink
into
the
marsh
near
them
light
hearted
william
light
hearted
william
twirled
his
november
moustaches
and
half
dressed
looked
from
the
bedroom
window
upon
the
spring
weather
sighed
he
gaily
leaning
out
to
see
up
and
down
the
street
where
a
heavy
sunlight
lay
beyond
some
blue
shadows
into
the
room
he
drew
his
head
again
and
laughed
to
himself
quietly
twirling
his
green
moustaches
portrait
of
the
author
the
birches
are
mad
with
green
points
the
wood
edge
is
burning
with
their
green
burning
seething
no
no
no
the
birches
are
opening
their
leaves
one
by
one
their
delicate
leaves
unfold
cold
and
separate
one
by
one
slender
tassels
hang
swaying
from
the
delicate
branch
tips
oh
i
can
not
say
it
there
is
no
word
black
is
split
at
once
into
flowers
in
every
bog
and
ditch
flares
of
small
fire
white
flowers
agh
the
birches
are
mad
mad
with
their
green
the
world
is
gone
torn
into
shreds
with
this
blessing
what
have
i
left
undone
that
i
should
have
undertaken
o
my
brother
you
redfaced
living
man
ignorant
stupid
whose
feet
are
upon
this
same
dirt
that
i
touch
and
eat
we
are
alone
in
this
terror
alone
face
to
face
on
this
road
you
and
i
wrapped
by
this
flame
let
the
polished
plows
stay
idle
their
gloss
already
on
the
black
soil
but
that
face
of
yours
answer
me
i
will
clutch
you
i
will
hug
you
grip
you
i
will
poke
my
face
into
your
face
and
force
you
to
see
me
take
me
in
your
arms
tell
me
the
commonest
thing
that
is
in
your
mind
to
say
say
anything
i
will
understand
you
it
is
the
madness
of
the
birch
leaves
opening
cold
one
by
one
my
rooms
will
receive
me
but
my
rooms
are
no
longer
sweet
spaces
where
comfort
is
ready
to
wait
on
me
with
its
crumbs
a
darkness
has
brushed
them
the
mass
of
yellow
tulips
in
the
bowl
is
shrunken
every
familiar
object
is
changed
and
dwarfed
i
am
shaken
broken
against
a
might
that
splits
comfort
blows
apart
my
careful
partitions
crushes
my
house
and
leaves
me
with
shrinking
heart
and
startled
empty
eyes
peering
out
into
a
cold
world
in
the
spring
i
would
drink
in
the
spring
i
would
be
drunk
and
lie
forgetting
all
things
your
face
give
me
your
face
yang
kue
fei
your
hands
your
lips
to
drink
give
me
your
wrists
to
drink
i
drag
you
i
am
drowned
in
you
you
overwhelm
me
drink
save
me
the
shad
bush
is
in
the
edge
of
the
clearing
the
yards
in
a
fury
of
lilac
blossoms
are
driving
me
mad
with
terror
drink
and
lie
forgetting
the
world
and
coldly
the
birch
leaves
are
opening
one
by
one
coldly
i
observe
them
and
wait
for
the
end
and
it
ends
the
lonely
street
school
is
over
it
is
too
hot
to
walk
at
ease
at
ease
in
light
frocks
they
walk
the
streets
to
while
the
time
away
they
have
grown
tall
they
hold
pink
flames
in
their
right
hands
in
white
from
head
to
foot
with
sidelong
idle
look
in
yellow
floating
stuff
black
sash
and
stockings
touching
their
avid
mouths
with
pink
sugar
on
a
stick
like
a
carnation
each
holds
in
her
hand
they
mount
the
lonely
street
the
great
figure
among
the
rain
and
lights
i
saw
the
figure
in
gold
on
a
red
firetruck
moving
with
weight
and
urgency
tense
unheeded
to
gong
clangs
siren
howls
and
wheels
rumbling
through
the
dark
city
