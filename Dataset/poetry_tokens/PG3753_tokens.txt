then
twenty
forty
sixty
eighty
a
hundred
years
ago
all
through
the
night
with
lantern
bright
the
watch
trudged
to
and
fro
and
little
boys
tucked
snug
abed
would
wake
from
dreams
to
hear
o
the
morning
by
the
clock
and
the
stars
clear
or
when
across
the
screamed
shrill
a
gale
a
faint
and
shaken
voice
would
shout
and
a
storm
of
hail
the
window
behind
the
blinds
i
sit
and
watch
the
people
passing
passing
by
and
not
a
single
one
can
see
my
tiny
watching
eye
they
can
not
see
my
little
room
all
yellowed
with
the
shaded
sun
they
do
not
even
know
i
here
nor
guess
when
i
am
gone
poor
henry
thick
in
its
glass
the
physic
stands
poor
henry
lifts
distracted
hands
his
round
cheek
wans
in
the
candlelight
to
smell
that
smell
to
see
that
sight
finger
and
thumb
clinch
his
small
nose
a
gurgle
a
gasp
and
down
it
goes
scowls
henry
now
but
mark
that
cheek
sleek
with
the
bloom
of
health
next
week
full
moon
one
night
as
dick
lay
half
asleep
into
his
drowsy
eyes
a
great
still
light
begins
to
creep
from
out
the
silent
skies
it
was
lovely
moon
for
when
he
raised
his
dreamy
head
her
surge
of
silver
filled
the
pane
and
streamed
across
his
bed
so
for
a
while
each
gazed
at
each
dick
and
the
solemn
moon
till
climbing
slowly
on
her
way
she
vanished
and
was
gone
the
bookworm
tired
oh
tired
of
books
said
jack
long
for
meadows
green
and
woods
where
shadowy
violets
nod
their
cool
leaves
between
i
long
to
see
the
ploughman
stride
his
darkening
acres
to
hear
the
hoarse
drive
their
billows
the
shore
i
long
to
watch
the
wheel
back
to
her
mate
or
where
the
breathing
cows
are
housed
lean
dreaming
the
gate
something
has
gone
and
ink
and
print
will
never
bring
it
back
i
long
for
the
green
fields
again
i
tired
of
books
said
jack
the
quartette
tom
sang
for
joy
and
ned
sang
for
joy
and
old
sam
sang
for
joy
all
we
four
boys
piped
up
loud
just
like
one
boy
and
the
ladies
that
sate
with
the
squire
their
cheeks
were
all
wet
for
the
noise
of
the
voice
of
us
boys
when
we
sang
our
quartette
tom
he
piped
low
and
ned
he
piped
low
and
old
sam
he
piped
low
into
a
sorrowful
fall
did
our
music
flow
and
the
ladies
that
sate
with
the
squire
vowed
they
never
forget
how
the
eyes
of
them
cried
for
delight
when
we
sang
our
quartette
mistletoe
sitting
under
the
mistletoe
fairy
mistletoe
one
last
candle
burning
low
all
the
sleepy
dancers
gone
just
one
candle
burning
on
shadows
lurking
everywhere
some
one
came
and
kissed
me
there
tired
i
was
my
head
would
go
nodding
under
the
mistletoe
fairy
mistletoe
no
footsteps
came
no
voice
but
only
just
as
i
sat
there
sleepy
lonely
stooped
in
the
still
and
shadowy
air
lips
unseen
and
kissed
me
there
the
lost
shoe
poor
little
lucy
by
some
mischance
lost
her
shoe
as
she
did
dance
was
not
on
the
stairs
not
in
the
hall
not
where
they
sat
at
supper
at
all
she
looked
in
the
garden
but
there
it
was
not
henhouse
or
kennel
or
high
dovecote
dairy
and
meadow
and
wild
woods
through
showed
not
a
trace
of
lucy
shoe
bird
nor
bunny
nor
glimmering
moon
breathed
a
whisper
of
where
was
gone
it
was
cried
and
cried
oyez
and
oyez
in
french
dutch
latin
and
portuguese
ships
the
dark
seas
went
plunging
through
but
none
brought
news
of
lucy
shoe
and
still
she
patters
in
silk
and
leather

in

all
the
world
over
for
her
lost
shoe
the
truants
ere
my
heart
beats
too
coldly
and
faintly
to
remember
sad
things
yet
be
gay
i
would
sing
a
brief
song
of
the
world
little
children
magic
hath
stolen
away
the
primroses
scattered
by
april
the
stars
of
the
wide
milky
way
can
not
outnumber
the
hosts
of
the
children
magic
hath
stolen
away
the
buttercup
green
of
the
meadows
the
snow
of
the
blossoming
may
lovelier
are
not
than
the
legions
of
children
magic
hath
stolen
away
the
waves
tossing
surf
in
the
moonbeam
the
albatross
lone
on
the
spray
alone
know
the
tears
wept
in
vain
for
the
children
magic
hath
stolen
away
in
vain
for
at
hush
of
the
evening
when
the
stars
twinkle
into
the
grey
seems
to
echo
the
calling
of
children
magic
hath
stolen
away
three
queer
tales
berries
there
was
an
old
woman
went
blackberry
picking
along
the
hedges
from
weep
to
wicking
half
a
no
more
she
had
got
when
out
steps
a
fairy
from
her
green
grot
and
says
jill
would
pick
ee
mo
and
jill
she
curtseys
and
looks
just
so
be
off
says
the
fairy
quick
as
you
can
over
the
meadows
to
the
little
green
lane
that
dips
to
the
hayfields
of
farmer
grimes
i
berried
those
hedges
a
score
of
times
bushel
on
bushel
i
jill
this
side
of
supper
pick
with
a
will
she
glints
very
bright
and
speaks
her
fair
then
lo
and
behold
she
had
faded
in
air
be
sure
old
goodie
she
trots
betimes
over
the
meadows
to
farmer
grimes
and
never
was
queen
with
jewelry
rich
as
those
same
hedges
from
twig
to
ditch
like
dutchmen
coffers
fruit
thorn
and
flower
they
shone
like
william
and
mary

and
be
sure
old
goodie
went
back
to
weep
so
tired
with
her
basket
she
scarce
could
creep
when
she
comes
in
the
dusk
to
her
cottage

there
towser
wagging
as
never

his
missus
so
glad

as
soon
as
next
morning
dawn
was
grey
the
pot
on

simmering
away
and
all
in
a
stew
and
a
towser

that
from

three
jolly
farmers
once
bet
a

the
others
would
off
the
ground
out
of
their
coats
they
slipped
right
soon
and
neat
and
nicesome
put
each
his
shoon
one
two
three
and
away
they
go
not
too
fast
and
not
too
slow
out
from
the
noonday
shadow
into
the
sun
and
across
the
meadow
past
the
schoolroom
with
knees
well
bent
fingers
they
dancing
went
up
sides
and
over
and
round
and
round
they
crossed
the
parish
bound
by
tupman
meadow
they
did
their
mile
on
a
stile
then
straight
through
whipham
downhill
to
week
footing
it
lightsome
but
not
too
quick
up
fields
to

and
on
through

and

all
left
behind
as
they
danced
through
wool
and
wool
gone
by
like

that
seem
to
spin
in

they
danced
in
dream
withy
wellover
like
an
old
clock
their
heels

go

league
and
a

and
a
league
they
went
and
not

weary
and
not

spent
and
io
and
behold
past
stretched
with
its
waters
the
great
green
sea
says
farmer

i
puffs
and
i
blows
what
under
the
water
why
no

says

and
a

man
drownded
is
far
to

but
farmer
turvey
on
twirling
toes
up
with
his
gaiters
and
in
he
goes
down
where
the
mermaids
pluck
and
play
on
their
twangling
harps
in
a
day
down
where
the
mermaids
finned
and
fair
sleek
with
their
combs
their
yellow
hair
bates
and
on
the
shingle
sat
gazing
at
floating
hat
but
never
a
ripple
nor
bubble
told
where
he
was
supping
off
plates
of
gold
never
an
echo
rilled
through
the
sea
of
the
feasting
and
dancing
and
minstrelsy
they
came
no
reply
nought
but
the
sandy
sigh
then
glum
and
silent
they
sat
instead
vacantly
brooding
on
home
and
bed
till
both
together
stood
up
and
knows
not
dreams
not
where
you
be
turvey
unless
in
the
deep
blue

square
turvey
off
the
ground
the
thief
at
robin
castle
there
came
a
thief
one
night
to
robin
castle
he
climbed
up
into
a
tree
and
sitting
with
his
head
among
the
branches
a
wondrous
sight
did
see
for
there
was
robin
supping
at
his
table
with
candles
of
pure
wax
his
dame
and
his
two
beauteous
little
children
with
velvet
on
their
backs
platters
for
each
there
were
of
silver
many
a
pound
and
all
of
beaten
gold
three
brimming
goblets
standing
the
table
round
the
smell
that
rose
up
richly
from
the
baked
meats
came
thinning
amid
the
boughs
and
much
that
greedy
thief
who
snuffed
the
night
his
hunger
did
arouse
he
watched
them
eating
drinking
laughing
talking
busy
with
finger
and
spoon
while
three
most
cunning
fiddlers
clad
in
crimson
played
them
a
and
he
waited
in
the
like
a
starling
till
the
moon
was
gotten
low
when
all
the
windows
in
the
walls
were
darkened
he
softly
in
did
go
there
robin
and
his
dame
in
bed
were
sleeping
and
his
children
young
and
fair
only
robin
hounds
from
their
warm
kennels
yelped
as
he
climbed
the
stair
all
all
were
sleeping
page
and
fiddler
cook
scullion
free
from
care
only
robin
stallions
from
their
stables
neighed
as
he
climbed
the
stair
a
wee
wan
light
the
moon
did
shed
him
hanging
above
the
sea
and
he
counted
into
his
bag
of
beaten
silver
platters
of
spoons
three
score
of
jolly
golden
goblets
he
stowed
in
four
save
one
and
six
fine
cupid
candlesticks
before
his
work
was
done
nine
bulging
bags
of
money
in
a
cupboard
two
snuffers
and
a
dish
he
found
the
last
all
studded
with
great
garnets
and
shapen
like
a
fish
then
tiptoe
up
he
stole
into
a
chamber
where
on
tasselled
pillows
lay
robin
and
his
daule
in
dreaming
slumbers
tired
with
the
summer
day
that
thief
he
mimbled
round
him
in
the
gloaming
their
treasure
for
to
spy
combs
brooches
chains
and
rings
and
pins
and
buckles
all
higgledy
a
watch
shaped
in
the
shape
of
a
flat
apple
in
purest
crystal
set
he
lifted
from
the
hook
where
it
was
ticking
and
crammed
in
his
pochette
he
heaped
the
pretty
baubles
on
the
table
trinketsi
pearls
diamonds
sapphires
topazes
and
all
in
his
bag
put
he
and
there
in
night
pale
gloom
was
robin
dreaming
he
was
hunting
the
mountain
bear
while
his
dame
in
peaceful
slumber
in
no
wise
heeded
a
greedy
thief
was
there
and
that
ravenous
thief
he
climbed
up
even
higher
till
into
a
chamber
small
he
crept
where
lay
poor
robin
beauteous
children
lovelier
in
sleep
withal
oh
fairer
was
their
hair
than
gold
of
goblet
silver
their
cheeks
did
shine
and
their
little
hands
that
lay
upon
the
linen
made
that
thief
hard
heart
to
pine
but
though
a
moment
there
his
hard
heart
faltered
eftsoones
be
took
them
twain
and
slipped
them
into
his
bag
with
all
his
plunder
and
soft
stole
down
again
spoon
platter
goblet
ducats
dishes
trinkets
and
those
two
children
dear
in
the
clinking
and
the
clanking
and
half
bemused
with
fear
he
carried
down
the
stairs
into
the
courtyard
but
there
he
made
no
stay
he
just
tied
up
his
garters
took
a
deep
breath
and
ran
like
the
wind
away
past
forest
river
mountain
river
he
coursed
the
whole
night
through
till
morning
found
him
come
into
a
country
where
none
his
bad
face
knew
past
mountain
river
forest
river
that
thief
lean
shanks
sped
on
till
evening
found
him
knocking
at
a
dark
house
his
breath
now
gone
there
came
a
little
maid
and
asked
his
business
a
cobbler
dwelt
within
and
though
she
much
misliked
the
bag
he
carried
she
led
the
bad
man
in
he
bargained
with
the
cobbler
for
a
lodging
and
soft
laid
down
his
in
the
dead
of
night
with
none
to
spy
or
from
off
his
weary
back
and
he
taught
the
little
chicks
to
call
him
father
and
he
sold
his
stolen
pelf
and
bought
a
palace
horses
slaves
and
peacocks
to
ease
his
wicked
self
and
though
the
children
never
really
loved
him
he
was
rich
past
all
belief
while
robin
and
his
dame
delf
and
pewter
spent
all
their
days
in
grief
places
and
people
a
widow
weeds
a
poor
old
widow
in
her
weeds
sowed
her
garden
with
seeds
not
too
shallow
and
not
too
deep
and
down
came
april
drip
drip
drip
up
shone
may
like
gold
and
soon
green
as
an
arbour
grew
leafy
june
and
now
all
summer
she
sits
and
sews
where
willow
herb
comfrey
bugloss
blows
teasle
and
pansy
meadowsweet
campion
toadflax
and
rough
hawksbit
brown
bee
orchis
and
peals
of
bells
clover
burnet
and
thyme
she
smells
like
oberon
meadows
her
garden
is
drowsy
from
dawn
to
dusk
with
bees
weeps
she
never
but
sometimes
sighs
and
peeps
at
her
garden
with
bright
brown
eyes
and
all
she
has
is
all
she
needs
a
poor
old
widow
in
her
weeds
black
as
a
chimney
is
his
face
and
ivory
white
his
teeth
and
in
his
cart
he
rides
the
chestnut
blooms
beneath
sooeep
he
cries
and
brightly
peers
this
way
and
that
to
see
with
his
two
shining
eyes
what
custom
there
may
be
and
once
inside
the
house
he
squat
and
drive
his
rods
on
high
till
twirls
his
sudden
sooty
brush
against
the
morning
sky
then
his
bulging
bags
of
soot
with
half
the
world
asleep
his
small
cart
wheels
him
off
again
still
hoarsely
bawling
macqueen
or
the
with
glass
like
a
and
shutters
of
green
down
on
the
cobbles
lives
macqueen
at
six
she
rises
at
nine
you
see
her
candle
shine
out
in
the
linden
tree
and
at
nine
not
a
sound
is
nigh
but
the
bright
moon
creeping
across
the
sky
or
a
far
dog
baying
or
a
twittering
bird
in
its
drowsy
nest
in
the
darkness
stirred
or
like
the
roar
of
a
distant
sea
a
in
the
linden
tree
the
little
green
orchard
some
one
is
always
sitting
there
in
the
little
green
orchard
even
when
the
sun
is
high
in
noon
unclouded
sky
and
faintly
droning
goes
the
bee
from
rose
to
rose
some
one
in
shadow
is
sitting
there
in
the
little
green
orchard
yes
when
the
twilight
falling
softly
in
the
little
green
orchard
when
the
grey
dew
distills
and
every
fills
when
the
last
blackbird
says
what
and
goes
her
way
ssh
i
have
heard
voices
calling
softly
in
the
little
green
orchard
not
that
i
am
afraid
of
being
there
in
the
little
green
orchard
why
when
the
moon
been
bright
shedding
her
lonesome
light
and
moths
like
ghosties
come
and
the
horned
snail
leaves
home
i
sat
there
whispering
and
listening
there
in
the
little
green
orchard
only
it
strange
to
be
feeling
there
in
the
little
green
orchard
whether
you
paint
or
draw
dig
hammer
chop
or
saw
when
you
are
most
alone
all
but
the
silence
gone
some
one
is
watching
and
waiting
there
in
the
little
green
orchard
poor
lone
and
alone
she
lies
poor
miss
five
steep
flights
from
the
earth
and
one
from
heaven
dark
hair
and
dark
brown
eyes
not
to
be
sad
she
tries
still
still
it
lonely
lies
poor
miss
one
watch
hath
she
poor
miss
not
in
some
orchard
sweet
in
april
devon
just
four
blank
walls
to
see
and
dark
come
shadowily
no
moon
no
stars
ah
me
poor
miss
and
then
to
wake
again
poor
miss
to
the
cold
night
to
have
sour
physic
given
out
of
some
dream
of
pain
then
strive
long
hours
in
vain
deep
dreamless
sleep
to
gain
poor
miss
yet
memory
softly
sings
poor
miss
songs
full
of
love
and
peace
and
gladness
even
clear
flowers
and
tiny
wings
all
tender
lovely
things
hope
to
her
bosom
brings
happy
miss
sam
when
sam
goes
back
in
memory
it
is
to
where
the
sea
breaks
on
the
shingle
in
white
foam
endlessly
he
says
with
small
brown
eye
on
used
to
keep
awake
and
lean
from
my
window
in
the
moon
watching
those
billows
break
and
half
a
million
tiny
hands
and
eyes
like
sparks
of
frost
would
dance
and
come
tumbling
into
the
moon
on
every
breaker
tossed
and
all
across
from
star
to
star
i
seen
the
watery
sea
with
not
a
single
ship
in
sight
just
ocean
there
and
me
and
heard
my
father
snore
and
once
as
sure
as
i
alive
out
of
those
wallowing
waves
i
saw
a
mermaid
dive
head
and
shoulders
above
the
wave
plain
as
i
now
see
you
combing
her
hair
now
back
now
front
her
two
eyes
peeping
through
calling
me
but
me
i
never
went
making
believe
i
kind
of
thought
was
some
one
else
she
meant
wonderful
lovely
there
she
sat
singing
the
night
away
all
in
the
solitudinous
sea
of
that
there
lonely
bay
and
he
smooth
his
hairless
mouth
if

hearkened
to
the
nightingale
sorrowfulness
till
all
his
own
was
gone
the
old
house
a
very
very
old
house
i
and
ever
so
many
people
go
past
the
small
lodge
forlorn
and
still
under
the
heavy
branches
till
comes
the
blank
wall
and
there
the
door
go
in
they
do
come
out
no
more
no
voice
says
aught
no
spark
of
light
across
that
threshold
cheers
the
sight
only
the
evening
star
on
high
less
lonely
makes
a
lonely
sky
as
one
by
one
the
people
go
into
that
very
old
house
i
know
beasts
unstooping
low
on
his
fours
the
lion
treads
with
the
surly
bear
but
men
straight
upward
from
the
dust
walk
with
their
heads
in
air
the
free
sweet
winds
of
heaven
the
sunlight
from
on
high
beat
on
their
clear
bright
cheeks
and
brows
as
they
go
striding
by
the
doors
of
all
their
houses
they
arch
so
they
may
go
uplifted
the
beasts
unstooping
to
and
fro
all
but
blind
all
but
blind
in
his
cambered
hole
gropes
for
worms
the
mole
all
but
blind
in
the
evening
sky
the
hooded
bat
twirls
softly
by
all
but
blind
in
the
burning
day
the
blunders
on
her
way
and
blind
as
are
these
three
to
me
so
blind
to
someone
i
must
be
nicholas
nye
thistle
and
darnell
and
dock
grew
there
and
a
bush
in
the
corner
of
may
on
the
orchard
wall
i
used
to
sprawl
in
the
blazing
heat
of
the
day
half
asleep
and
half
awake
while
the
birds
went
twittering
by
and
nobody
there
my
lone
to
share
but
nicholas
nye
nicholas
nye
was
lean
and
gray
lame
of
leg
and
old
more
than
a
score
of
donkey
years
he
had
been
since
he
was
foaled
he
munched
the
thistles
purple
and
spiked
would
sometimes
stoop
and
sigh
and
turn
to
his
head
as
if
he
said
poor
nicholas
nye
alone
with
his
shadow
he
drowse
in
the
meadow
lazily
swinging
his
tail
at
break
of
day
he
used
to
bray
not
much
too
hearty
and
hale
but
a
wonderful
gumption
was
under
his
skin
and
a
clean
calm
light
in
his
eye
and
once
in
a
while
he
smile
would
nicholas
nye
seem
to
be
smiling
at
me
he
would
from
his
bush
in
the
corner
of
may
bony
and
ownerless
widowed
and
worn
lonely
and
gray
and
over
the
grass
would
seem
to
pass
the
deep
dark
blue
of
the
sky
something
much
better
than
words
between
me
and
nicholas
nye
but
dusk
would
come
in
the
apple
boughs
the
green
of
the
shine
the
birds
in
nest
would
crouch
to
rest
and
home
i
trudge
to
mine
and
there
in
the
moonlight
dark
with
dew
asking
not
wherefore
nor
why
would
brood
like
a
ghost
and
as
still
as
a
post
old
nicholas
nye
the
pigs
and
the
charcoal
burner
the
old
pig
said
to
the
little
pigs
the
forest
is
truffles
and
mast
follow
me
then
all
ye
little
pigs
follow
me
fast
the
sat
in
the
shade
with
his
chin
on
his
thumb
and
saw
the
big
pig
and
the
little
pigs
chuffling
come
he
watched
a
green
and
giant
bough
and
the
pigs
in
the
ground
made
a
wonderful
grizzling
and
gruzzling
and
a
greedy
sound
and
when
they
were
gone
and
night
walked
her
starry
ways
he
stared
with
his
cheeks
in
his
hands
at
his
sullen
blaze
five
eyes
in
hans
old
mill
his
three
black
cats
watch
the
bins
for
the
thieving
rats
whisker
and
claw
they
crouch
in
the
night
their
five
eyes
smouldering
green
and
bright
squeaks
from
the
flour
sacks
squeaks
from
where
the
cold
wind
stirs
on
the
empty
stair
squeaking
and
scampering
everywhere
then
down
they
pounce
now
in
now
out
at
whisking
tail
and
sniffing
snout
while
lean
old
hans
he
snores
away
till
peep
of
light
at
break
of
day
then
up
he
climbs
to
his
creaking
mill
out
come
his
cats
all
grey
with
meal
jekkel
and
jessup
and
jill
grim
beside
the
blaze
of
forty
fires

upon

the

hidden
in
the
valley

a
village
fast
asleep

for

laughing
softly
in

but
the

was
still
the
cherry
boughs
were
still
and
the
the
empty
sill
and
never
from

and
out
of
her
cold
cottage
never
answered

the
fairy
mimbling
mambling
in
the
garden
bewitched
i
have
heard
a
lady
this
night
lissom
and
jimp
and
slim
calling
me
calling
me
over
the
heather
the
beech
boughs
dusk
and
dim
i
have
followed
a
lady
this
night
followed
her
far
and
lone
fox
and
adder
and
weasel
know
the
ways
that
we
have
gone
i
sit
at
my
supper
honest
faces
and
crumble
my
crust
and
say
naught
in
the
drawl
of
the
voices
talking
the
hours
away
i
go
to
my
chamber
under
the
gable
and
the
moon
will
lift
her
light
in
at
my
lattice
from
over
the
moorland
hollow
and
still
and
bright
and
i
know
she
will
shine
on
a
lady
of
witchcraft
gladness
and
grief
to
see
who
has
taken
my
heart
with
her
nimble
fingers
calls
in
my
dreams
to
me
who
has
led
me
a
dance
by

my
human
soul
to
win
made
me
a
changeling
to
my
own
own
mother
a
stranger
to
my
kin
the
honey
robbers
there
were
two
fairies
gimmul
and
mel
loved
earth
man
honey
passing
well
oft
at
the
hives
of
his
tame
bees
they
would
their
sugary
thirst
appease
when
dusk
began
to
darken
to
night
they
would
hie
along
in
the
fading
light
with
hair
and
scarlet
lips
and
small
stone
knives
to
slit
the
skeps
so
softly
not
a
bee
inside
should
hear
the
woven
straw
divide
and
then
with
sly
and
greedy
thumbs
would
rifle
the
sweet
honeycombs
and
drowsily
drone
to
drone
would
say
cold
cold
wind
blows
in
this
way
and
the
great
queen
would
turn
her
head
from
face
to
face
astonished
and
though
her
maids
with
comb
and
brush
would
comb
and
soothe
and
whisper
about
the
hive
would
shrilly
go
a
keening
keening
to
and
fro
at
which
those
robbers
the
trees
would
taunt
and
mock
the
and
through
their
sticky
teeth
would
buzz
just
as
an
angry
hornet
does
and
when
this
gimmul
and
this
mel
had
munched
and
sucked
and
swilled
their
fill
or
ever
man
first

could
crow

yelled

all
across
the

shrill
it
rang
rang
through
the

fairies
there
were
and
a

lifted
her

a

piped
by

by

there
was
longlegs
straddling
and
hearkening
was
he
to
distant
echo
thrilling
back
a
thin
melmillo
three
and
thirty
birds
there
stood
in
an
elder
in
a
wood
called
melmillo
flew
off

then
stole
melmillo
in
to
that
wood
all
dusk
and
green
and
with
lean
long
palms
outspread
softly
a
strange
dance
did
tread
not
a
note
of
music
she
had
for
echoing
company
all
the
birds
were
flown
to
rest
in
the
hollow
of

a

mouse
goes
scampering
by
with
silver

and
silver
eye
and
moveless
fish
in
the
water
gleam
by
silver
reeds
in
a
silver
stream
nobody
knows
often
i
heard
the
wind
sigh
by
the
ivied
orchard
wall
over
the
leaves
in
the
dark
night
breathe
a
sighing
call
and
faint
away
in
the
silence
while
i
in
my
bed
wondered
dreaming
and
waking
what
it
said
nobody
knows
what
the
wind
is
under
the
height
of
the
sky
where
the
hosts
of
the
stars
keep
far
away
house
and
its
wave
sweeps
by
just
a
great
wave
of
the
air
tossing
the
leaves
in
its
sea
and
foaming
under
the
eaves
of
the
roof
that
covers
me
and
so
we
live
under
deep
water
all
of
us
beasts
and
men
and
our
bodies
are
buried
down
under
the
sand
when
we
go
again
and
leave
like
the
fishes
our
shells
and
float
on
the
wind
and
away
to
where
the
marvellous
tides
of
the
air
burns
day
wanderers
wide
are
the
meadows
of
night
and
daisies
are
shining
there
tossing
their
lovely
dews
lustrous
and
fair
and
through
these
sweet
fields
go
wanderers
amid
the
stars
venus
mercury
uranus
neptune
saturn
jupiter
mars
in
their
silver
they
move
and
circling
whisper
and

fair
are
the

meads
of
delight
through
which
we
stray
many
a
mickle
a

only
a

in
a

a
trembling
fiddle
a
trumpet
ring
the
shuddering
drum
so
all
the
glory
bravery
hush
of
music
come
a
little
sound
only
a
stir
and
a
sigh
of
each
green
leaf
its
fluttering
neighbor
by
oak
on
to
oak
the
wide
dark
forest
through
so
the
watery
wheeling
world
the
night
winds
go
a
little
sound
only
a
little
a
little
the
thin
high
drone
of
the
simmering
kettle
the
gathering
frost
the
click
of
needle
and
thread
mother
the
fading
wall
the
dream
the
drowsy
bed
will
ever
will
he
ever
be
weary
of
wandering
the
flaming
sun
ever
weary
of
waning
in
lovelight
the
white
still
moon
will
ever
a
shepherd
come
with
a
crook
of
simple
gold
and
lead
all
the
little
stars
like
lambs
to
the
fold
will
ever
the
wanderer
sail
from
over
the
sea
up
the
river
of
water
to
the
stones
to
me
will
he
take
us
all
into
his
ship
dreaming
and
waft
us
far
to
where
in
the
clouds
of
the
west
the
islands
are
songs
the
song
of
the
secret
where
is
beauty
gone
gone
the
cold
winds
have
taken
it
with
their
faint
moan
the
white
stars
have
shaken
it
trembling
down
into
the
pathless
deeps
of
the
sea
gone
gone
is
beauty
from
me
the
clear
naked
flower
is
faded
and
dead
the
willow
drooping
her
head
whispers
low
to
the
shade
of
her
boughs
in
the
stream
sighing
a
beauty
secret
as
dream
the
song
of
the
soldiers
as
i
sat
musing
by
the
frozen
dyke
there
was
a
man
marching
with
a
bright
steel
pike
marching
in
the
dayshine
like
a
ghost
came
he
and
behind
me
was
the
moaning
and
the
murmur
of
the
sea
as
i
sat
musing
was
not
one
but
ten
rank
on
rank
of
ghostly
soldiers
marching
the
fen
marching
in
the
misty
air
they
showed
in
dreams
to
me
and
behind
me
was
the
shouting
and
the
shattering
of
the
sea
as
i
sat
musing
was
a
host
in
dark
array
with
their
horses
and
their
cannon
wheeling
onward
to
the
fray
moving
like
a
shadow
to
the
fate
the
brave
must
dree
and
behind
me
roared
the
drums
rang
the
trumpets
of
the
sea
the
bees
song
thousandz
of
thornz
there
be
on
the
rozez
where

the

song
of
enchantment
a
song
of
enchantment
i
sang
me
there
in
a
green
green
wood
by
waters
fair
just
as
the
words
came
up
to
me
i
sang
it
under
the
wildwood
tree
widdershins
turned
i
singing
it
low
watching
the
wild
birds
come
and
go
no
cloud
in
the
deep
dark
blue
to
be
seen
under
the
branches
green
twilight
came
silence
came
the
planet
of
evening
silver
flame
by
darkening
paths
i
wandered
through
thickets
trembling
with
drops
of
dew
but
the
music
is
lost
and
the
words
are
gone
of
the
song
i
sang
as
i
sat
alone
ages
and
ages
have
fallen
on
me
on
the
wood
and
the
pool
and
the
elder
tree
dream
song
sunlight
moonlight
twilight
gloaming
at
the
close
of
day
and
an
owl
calling
cool
dews
falling
in
a
wood
of
oak
and
may
torchlight
darkness
at
the
shut
of
day
and
lions
roaring
their
wrath
pouring
in
wild
waste
places
far
away
and
and
the
sea
a
shimmering
gloom
of
grey
and
a
small
face
smiling
in
a
dream
beguiling
in
a
world
of
wonders
far
away
the
song
of
shadows
sweep
thy
faint
strings
musician
with
thy
long
lean
hand
downward
the
starry
tapers
burn
sinks
soft
the
waning
sand
the
old
hound
whimpers
couched
in
sleep
the
embers
smoulder
low
across
the
walls
the
shadows
come
and
go
sweep
softly
thy
strings
musician
the
minutes
mount
to
hours
frost
on
the
windless
casement
weaves
a
labyrinth
of
flowers
ghosts
linger
in
the
darkening
air
hearken
at
the
open
door
music
hath
called
them
dreaming
home
once
more
the
song
of
the
mad
prince
who
said
pie
the
old
king
to
the
sparrow
who
said
are
ripe
rust
to
the
harrow
who
said
sleeps
she
now
where
rests
she
now
her
head
bathed
in
eve
loveliness
that
what
i
said
who
said
mum
the
word
sexton
to
willow
who
said
duck
for
dreams
moss
for
a
pillow
who
said
time
delight
hath
she
for
narrow
bed
life
troubled
bubble
broken
that
what
i
said
the
song
of
finis
at
the
edge
of
all
the
ages
a
knight
sate
on
his
steed
his
armor
red
and
thin
with
rust
his
soul
from
sorrow
freed
and
he
lifted
up
his
visor
from
a
face
of
skin
and
bone
and
his
horse
turned
head
and
whinnied
as
the
twain
stood
there
alone
no
bird
above
that
steep
of
time
sang
of
a
livelong
quest
no
wind
breathed
rest
lone
for
an
end
cried
knight
to
steed
loosed
an
eager
rein
charged
with
his
challenge
into
space
and
quiet
did
quiet
remain
