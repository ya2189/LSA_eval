preface
the
following
poems
are
taken
from
a
well
known
manuscript
in
the
cottonian
collection
marked
nero
x
which
also
contains
in
the
same
handwriting
and
dialect
a
metrical
romance
wherein
the
adventures
of
sir
gawayne
with
the
in
green
are
most
ably
and
interestingly
described
unfortunately
nothing
can
be
affirmed
with
any
certainty
concerning
the
authorship
of
these
most
valuable
and
interesting
compositions
the
editor
of
gawayn
and
the
green
considers
that
huchowne
a
supposed
scotch
of
the
fourteenth
century
has
the
best
claims
to
be
recognised
as
the
author
inasmuch
as
he
is
specially
referred
to
by
wyntown
as
the
writer
of
the
gest
of
and
the
of
i
do
not
think
that
any
certain
conclusions
are
to
be
drawn
from
the
scotch
assertion
it
is
well
known
that
more
versifiers
than
one
during
the
fourteenth
century
attempted
romance
composition
in
the
english
language
having
for
their
theme
the
knightly
deeds
of
arthur
or
sir
gawayne
these
they
compiled
from
french
originals
from
which
they
selected
the
most
striking
incidents
and
those
best
suited
to
an
taste
for
the
marvellous
we
are
not
surprised
then
at
finding
so
many
romance
poems
treating
of
the
exploits
of
the
same
hero
and
laying
claim
to
be
considered
as
original
productions
in
scotland
works
might
no
doubt
have
been
regarded
as
the
standard
romances
of
the
period
but
that
they
were
the
only
english
is
indeed
very
doubtful
the
early
english
alliterative
romance
entitled
the
published
from
a
manuscript
in
lincoln
cathedral
by
halliwell
is
considered
by
sir
madden
to
be
the
veritable
of
composed
by
huchowne
an
examination
of
this
romance
does
not
lead
me
to
the
same
conclusion
unless
huchowne
was
a
midland
man
for
the
poem
is
not
written
in
the
old
scotch
dialect
but
seems
to
have
been
originally
composed
in
one
of
the
northumbrian
dialects
spoken
of
the
tweed
the
manuscript
from
which
halliwell
has
taken
his
text
is
not
the
original
copy
nor
even
a
literal
transcript
of
it
it
exhibits
certain
orthographical
and
grammatical
peculiarities
unknown
to
the
northumbrian
dialect
which
have
been
introduced
by
a
midland
transcriber
who
has
here
and
there
taken
the
liberty
to
adapt
the
original
text
to
the
dialect
of
his
own
locality
probably
that
one
of
the
north
midland
counties
where
many
of
the
northumbrian
forms
of
speech
would
be
intelligible
a
comparison
of
the
arthurian
romance
with
the
following
poems
throws
no
light
whatever
upon
the
authorship
of
the
poems
the
dialect
of
the
two
works
is
altogether
different
although
many
of
the
terms
employed
are
common
to
both
being
well
known
over
the
whole
of
the
north
of
england
the
grammatical
forms
the
best
test
we
can
have
in
the
poems
are
quite
distinct
from
those
in
the
and
of
course
go
far
to
prove
that
they
do
not
proceed
from
the
pen
of
the
same
writer
the
editor
of
gawayn
and
the
green
acknowledges
that
the
poems
in
the
present
volume
as
now
preserved
to
us
in
the
manuscript
are
not
in
the
scottish
dialect
but
he
says
is
sufficient
internal
evidence
of
their
being
although
the
manuscript
containing
them
appears
to
have
been
written
by
a
scribe
of
the
midland
counties
which
will
account
for
the
introduction
of
forms
differing
from
those
used
by
writers
beyond
the
now
with
regard
to
this
subsequent
transcription
of
the
poems
from
the
scotch
into
a
midland
dialect
it
can
not
be
said
to
be
improbable
for
we
have
abundant
instances
of
the
multiplication
of
copies
by
scribes
of
different
localities
so
that
we
are
not
surprised
at
finding
the
works
of
some
of
our
popular
early
english
writers
appearing
in
two
or
three
forms
but
on
the
other
hand
a
comparison
of
the
original
copy
with
the
or
even
the
reading
of
a
transcribed
copy
always
shows
how
the
productions
have
suffered
by
the
change
poetical
works
especially
those
with
final
rhymes
of
course
undergo
the
greatest
amount
of
transformation
and
depreciation
the
changes
incident
upon
the
kind
of
transcription
referred
to
are
truly
surprising
and
most
perplexing
to
those
who
make
the
subject
of
early
english
a
matter
of
investigation
but
in
the
present
poems
the
uniformity
and
consistency
of
the
grammatical
forms
is
so
entire
that
there
is
indeed
no
internal
evidence
of
subsequent
transcription
into
any
other
dialect
than
that
in
which
they
were
originally
written
however
the
dialect
and
grammatical
peculiarities
will
be
considered
hereafter
again
in
the
course
of
transcription
into
another
dialect
any
literary
merit
that
the
copy
may
have
originally
possessed
would
certainly
be
destroyed
but
the
poems
before
us
are
evidently
the
work
of
a
man
of
birth
and
education
the
productions
of
a
true
poet
and
of
one
who
had
acquired
a
perfect
mastery
over
that
form
of
the
english
tongue
spoken
in
his
own
immediate
locality
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
fourteenth
century
leaving
out
of
consideration
their
great
philological
worth
they
possess
an
intrinsic
value
of
their
own
as
literary
compositions
very
different
from
anything
to
be
found
in
the
works
of
robert
of
gloucester
manning
and
many
other
early
english
authors
which
are
very
important
as
philological
records
but
in
the
light
of
poetical
productions
can
not
be
said
to
hold
a
very
distinguished
place
in
english
literature
the
poems
in
the
present
volume
contain
many
passages
which
as
sir
madden
truly
remarks
will
bear
comparison
with
any
similar
ones
in
the
works
of
douglas
or
spenser
i
conclude
therefore
that
these
poems
were
not
transcribed
from
the
scotch
dialect
into
any
other
but
were
written
in
their
own
speech
in
which
we
now
have
them
donaldson
who
is
now
editing
for
the
early
english
text
society
the
troy
book
translated
from
guido
di
colonna
puts
forward
a
plea
for
huchowne
as
its
author
to
whom
he
would
also
assign
the
ed
perry
and
the
pistel
of
sweet
susan
but
donaldson
seems
to
have
been
misled
by
the
similarity
of
vocabulary
which
is
not
at
all
a
safe
criterion
in
judging
of
works
written
in
a
northumbrian
west
or
east
midland
speech
the
dialect
i
venture
to
think
is
a
far
safer
test
a
careful
examination
of
the
troy
book
compels
me
to
differ
in
toto
from
donaldson
and
instead
of
assigning
the
troy
book
to
a
scotchman
say
that
it
can
not
even
be
claimed
in
its
present
form
by
any
northumbrian
south
of
the
tweed
moreover
it
presents
no
appearance
of
having
been
tampered
with
by
one
unacquainted
with
the
dialect
though
it
has
perhaps
been
slightly
modernised
in
the
course
of
transcription
the
work
is
evidently
a
genuine
production
having
most
of
the
peculiarities
of
vocabulary
and
inflexions
that
are
found
in
these
i
feel
greatly
inclined
to
claim
this
english
troy
book
as
the
production
of
the
author
of
the
for
leaving
out
identical
and
by
no
means
common
expressions
we
find
the
same
power
of
description
and
the
same
tendency
to
inculcate
moral
and
religious
truths
on
all
occasions
where
an
opportunity
presents
itself
without
dwelling
upon
this
topic
which
properly
falls
to
the
editor
of
the
troy
book

may
not
be

he
falls
asleep

namely
southern

northern
or
as
they
are

garnett
objects
to
classification
and
considers
it
certain
there
were
in
his
time
and
probably
long
before
five
distinctly
marked
forms
which
may
be
classed
as
follows
southern
or
standard
english
which
in
the
fourteenth
century
was
perhaps
best
spoken
in
kent
and
surrey
by
the
body
of
the
inhabitants
western
english
of
which
traces
may
be
found
from
hampshire
to
devonshire
and
northward
as
far
as
the
avon
mercian
vestiges
of
which
appear
in
shropshire
staffordshire
and
south
and
west
derbyshire
becoming
distinctly
marked
in
cheshire
and
still
more
so
in
south
lancashire
anglian
of
which
there
are
three
the
east
anglian
of
norfolk
and
suffolk
the
middle
anglian
of
lincolnshire
nottinghamshire
and
east
derbyshire
and
the
north
anglian
of
the
west
riding
of
yorkshire
spoken
most
purely
in
the
central
part
of
the
mountainous
district
of
craven
northumbrian
spoken
throughout
the
lowlands
of
scotland
northumberland
durham
and
nearly
the
whole
of
yorkshire
division
is
based
upon
peculiarities
of
pronunciation
which
will
be
found
well
marked
in
the
provincial
dialects
and
not
upon
any
essential
differences
of
inflexion
that
are
to
be
found
in
our
early
english
manuscripts
the
distinction
between
southern
and
western
english
was
not
at
all
required
as
the
kentish
ayenbite
of
inwyt
exhibits

peculiarities
that

chronicles
of

a
xi
as
a
southern
or

the
anglian
of

lincolnshire
and
nottinghamshire
may
be
referred
to
one
group
with
the
mercian
of
lancashire
as
varieties
of
the
midland
dialect
a
careful
examination
of
our
early
literature
leads
us
to
adopt
classification
as
not
only
a
convenient
but
a
correct
one
there
is
perhaps
no
better
test
for
distinguishing
these
dialects
from
one
another
than
the
verbal
inflexions
of
the
plural
number
in
the
present
tense
indicative
mood
to
state
this
test
in
the
briefest
manner
we
may
say
that
the
southern
dialect
employs
the
midland
and
the
northumbrian
as
the
inflexion
for
all
persons
of
the
plural
present
indicative
southern
midland
northern
pers
we
hope
ye
hope
they
hope
it
is
the
constant
and
systematic
employment
of
these
inflexions
and
not
their
occasional
use
that
must
be
taken
as
the
criterion
of
dialectical
varieties
in
a
pure
specimen
of
the
southern
dialect
we
never
find
the
northumbrian
we
do
occasionally
meet
with
the
midland
but
only
in
those
works
written
in
localities
where
from
their
geographical
position
southern
and
midland
forms
would
be
intelligible
we
might
look
in
vain
for
the
southern
plural
in
a
pure
northumbrian
production
but
might
be
more
successful
in
finding
the
midland
in
the
third
person
plural
as
for
or
in
a
work
composed
in
lincolnshire
nottinghamshire
or
lancashire
we
should
be
sure
to
find
the
occasional
use
of
the
northumbrian
plural
the
inflexions
of
the
verb
in
the
singular
are
of
value
in
enabling
us
to
discriminate
between
the
several
varieties
of
the
midland
dialect
the
southern
and
midland
idioms
with
the
exception
of
the
of
lancashire
cheshire
etc
conjugated
the
verb
in
the
singular
present
indicative
as
follows
pers
hope
i
hope
thou
hopest
he
hopes
the
corresponding
to
mercian
instead
of
and
employs
the
inflexions
that
are
so
common
in
the
northumbrian
documents
of
the
ninth
and
tenth
centuries
pers
hope
i
hope
thou
hopest
he
hopes
the
northumbrian
dialect
takes
in
all
three
persons
but
mostly
drops
it
in
the
first
person
the
peasantry
of
cheshire
and
lancashire
still
preserve
the
verbal
inflexions
which
prevailed
in
the
fourteenth
century
and
conjugate
their
verbs
in
the
present
indicative
according
to
the
following
model
singular
plural
pers
hope
hopen
hopes
hopen
hopes
hopen
inasmuch
as
the
poems
in
the
present
volume
exhibit
the
systematic
use
of
these
forms
we
can
not
but
believe
that
they
were
originally
composed
in
one
of
those
counties
where
these
verbal
inflexions
were
well
known
and
extensively
used
we
have
to
choose
between
several
localities
but
if
we
assign
the
poems
to
lancashire
we
are
enabled
to
account
for
the
large
number
of
norse
terms
employed
it
is
true
that
the
ancient
examples
of
the
lancashire
dialect
contained
in
metrical
romances
the
boke
of
curtasye
and
liber
cure
cocorum
present
us
with
much
broader
forms
as
for
in
the
plural
number
and
possessive
case
of
nouns
for
in
the
plural
present
indicative
mood
in
passive
participles
of
irregular
or
strong
verbs
for
in
the
past
tense
and
passive
participle
of
regular
or
weak
verbs
and
the
pronominal
forms
their
them
for
and
these
forms
are
evidence
of
a
broad
pronunciation
which
at
the
present
time
is
said
to
be
a
characteristic
of
the
northwestern
division
of
lancashire
but
i
think
that
there
is
good
evidence
for
asserting
that
this
strong
provincialism
was
not
confined
formerly
to
the
dialect
much
less
to
a
division
of
any
particular
county
we
find
traces
of
it
in
poems
shropshire
the
romance
of
william
and
the
werwolf
and
even
in
the
wickliffite
version
of
the
scriptures
formerly
being
influenced
by
these
broad
forms
i
was
led
to
select
cheshire
or
staffordshire
as
the
probable
locality
where
the
poems
were
written
but
i
do
not
now
think
that
either
of
these
counties
ever
employed
a
vocabulary
containing
so
many
norse
terms
as
are
to
be
found
in
the
lancashire
dialect
but
although
we
may
not
be
able
to
fix
with
certainty
upon
any
one
county
in
particular
the
fact
of
the
present
poems
being
composed
in
the
dialect
can
not
be
denied
much
may
be
said
in
favour
of
their
lancashire
origin
and
there
are
one
or
two
points
of
resemblance
between
our
poems
the
lancashire
romances
and
liber
cure
cocorum
that
deserve
especial
notice
i
in
sir
amadace
lxviii
there
occurs
the
curious
form
as
it
appears
only
once
throughout
the
romances
we
might
conclude
that
it
is
an
error
of
the
scribe
for
but
when
we
find
in
the
poems
before
us
not
only
mightst
but
wouldst
couldst
dippedest
travelledst
we
are
bound
to
consider
as
a
genuine
form
in
no
other
early
english
works
of
the
fourteenth
century
have
i
been
able
to
find
this
peculiarity
it
is
very
common
in
wohunge
of
ure
xiiith
see
homilies
the
northumbrian
dialect
at
this
period
rejected
the
inflexion
in
the
second
person
preterite
singular
of
regular
verbs
and
in
our
poems
we
find
the
often
dropped
so
that
we
get
two
conjugations
which
may
be
called
the
inflected
and
the
uninflected
form
inflected
uninflected
pers
hopede
hoped

originally
the
inflected
form
may
have
prevailed
over
the
whole
of
the
north
of
england
but
have
gradually
become
confined
to
the
dialect
ii
the
next
point
of
resemblance
is
the
use
of
the
verb
schin
or
schun
schal
shall
it
is
still
preserved
in
the
modern
dialect
of
lancashire
in
combination
with
the
adverb

examples

i
description
of
a
lost
pearl
a
beloved
child
the
father
laments
the
loss
of
his
pearl
he
often
visits
the
spot
where
his
pearl
disappeared
and
hears
a
sweet
song
where
the
pearl
was
buried
there
he
found
lovely
flowers
each
blade
of
grass
springs
from
a
dead
grain
in
the
high
season
of
august
the
parent
visits
the
grave
of
his
lost
child
beautiful
flowers
covered
the
grave
from
them
came
a
delicious
odour
the
bereaved
father
wrings
his
hands
for
sorrow
falls
asleep
upon
the
flowery
plot
and
dreams
ii
in
spirit
he
is
carried
to
an
unknown
region
where
the
rocks
and
cliffs
gleamed
gloriously
the
hill
sides
were
decked
with
crystal
cliffs
the
leaves
of
the
trees
were
like
burnished
silver
the
gravel
consisted
of
precious
pearls
the
father
forgets
his
sorrow
he
sees
birds
of
the
most
beautiful
hues
and
hears
their
sweet
melody
no
tongue
could
describe
the
beauty
of
the
forest
all
shone
like
gold
the
dreamer
arrives
at
the
bank
of
a
river
which
gave
forth
sweet
sounds
in
it
stones
glittered
like
stars
in
the
welkin
on
a
winter
night
iii
his
grief
abates
and
he
follows
the
course
of
the
stream
no
one
could
describe
his
great
joy
he
thought
that
paradise
was
on
the
opposite
bank
the
stream
was
not
fordable
more
and
more
he
desires
to
see
what
is
beyond
the
brook
but
the
way
seemed
difficult
the
dreamer
finds
new
marvels
he
sees
a
crystal
cliff
at
the
foot
of
which
sits
a
maiden
clothed
in
glistening
white
he
knows
that
he
has
seen
her
before
he
desires
to
call
her
but
is
afraid
at
finding
her
in
such
a
strange
place
iv
so
he
stands
still
like
a
well
trained
hawk
he
fears
lest
she
should
escape
before
he
could
speak
to
her
his
long
lost
one
is
dressed
in
royal
array
decked
with
precious
pearls
she
comes
along
the
stream
towards
him
her
kirtle
is
composed
of
ornamented
with
pearls
she
wore
a
crown
of
pearls
her
hair
hung
down
about
her
her
colour
was
whiter
than
whalebone
her
hair
shone
as
gold
the
trimming
of
her
robe
consisted
of
precious
pearls
a
wonderful
pearl
was
set
in
her
breast
no
man
from
here
to
greece
was
so
glad
as
the
father
when
he
saw
his
pearl
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
the
maiden
salutes
him
the
father
enquires
of
the
maiden
whether
she
is
his
pearl
and
longs
to
know
who
has
deprived
him
of
his
treasure
the
maiden
tells
him
that
his
pearl
is
not
really
lost
she
is
in
a
garden
of
delight
where
sin
and
mourning
are
unknown
the
rose
that
he
had
lost
is
become
a
pearl
of
price
the
pearl
blames
his
rash
speech
the
father
begs
the
maiden
to
excuse
his
speech
for
he
really
thought
his
pearl
was
wholly
lost
to
him
the
maiden
tells
her
father
that
he
has
spoken
three
words
without
knowing
the
meaning
of
one
the
first
word
the
second
the
third
vi
he
is
little
to
be
praised
who
loves
what
he
sees
to
love
nothing
but
what
one
sees
is
great
presumption
to
live
in
this
kingdom
heaven
leave
must
be
asked
this
stream
must
be
passed
over
by
death
the
father
asks
his
pearl
whether
she
is
about
to
doom
him
to
sorrow
again
if
he
loses
his
pearl
he
does
not
care
what
happens
to
him
the
maiden
tells
her
father
to
suffer
patiently
though
he
may
dance
as
any
doe
yet
he
must
abide
doom
he
must
cease
to
strive
all
lies
in
power
to
make
men
joyful
or
sad
vii
the
father
beseeches
the
pearl
to
have
pity
upon
him
he
says
that
she
has
been
both
his
bale
and
bliss
and
when
he
lost
her
he
knew
not
what
had
become
of
her
and
now
that
he
sees
her
in
bliss
she
takes
little
heed
of
his
sorrow
he
desires
to
know
what
life
she
leads
the
maiden
tells
him
that
he
may
walk
and
abide
with
her
now
that
he
is
humble
all
are
meek
that
dwell
in
the
abode
of
bliss
all
lead
a
blissful
life
she
reminds
her
father
that
she
was
very
young
when
she
died
now
she
is
crowned
a
queen
in
heaven
viii
the
father
of
the
maiden
does
not
fully
understand
her
mary
he
says
is
the
queen
of
heaven
no
one
is
able
to
remove
the
crown
from
her
the
maiden
addresses
the
virgin
she
then
explains
to
her
father
that
each
has
his
place
in
heaven
the
court
of
god
has
a
property
in
its
own
being
each
one
in
it
is
a
king
or
queen
the
mother
of
christ
holds
the
chief
place
we
are
all
members
of
body
look
that
each
limb
be
perfect
the
father
replies
that
he
can
not
understand
how
his
pearl
can
be
a
queen
he
desires
to
know
what
greater
honour
she
can
have
ix
she
was
only
two
years
old
when
she
died
and
could
do
nothing
to
please
god
she
might
be
a
countess
or
some
great
lady
but
not
a
queen
the
maiden
informs
her
father
that
there
is
no
limit
to
power
the
parable
of
the
labourers
in
the
vineyard
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
hires
workmen
for
a
penny
a
day
at
noon
the
lord
hires
other
men
standing
idle
in
the
market
place
he
commands
them
to
go
into
his
vineyard
and
he
will
give
them
what
is
right
at
an
hour
before
the
sun
went
down
the
lord
sees
other
men
standing
idle
tells
them
to
go
into
the
vineyard
x
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
gone
down
the
was
told
to
pay
the
workmen
to
give
each
a
penny
the
first
began
to
complain
having
borne
the
heat
of
the
day
he
thinks
that
he
deserves
more
the
lord
tells
him
that
he
agreed
only
to
give
him
a
penny
the
last
shall
be
first
and
the
first
last
the
maiden
applies
the
parable
to
herself
she
came
to
the
vine
in
eventide
and
yet
received
more
than
others
who
had
lived
longer
the
father
says
that
his
tale
is
unreasonable
xi
in
heaven
the
maiden
says
each
man
is
paid
alike
god
is
no
niggard
the
grace
of
god
is
sufficient
for
all
those
who
live
long
on
the
earth
often
forfeit
heaven
by
sinning
innocents
are
saved
by
baptism
why
should
not
god
allow
their
labour
our
first
father
lost
heaven
by
eating
an
apple
and
all
are
damned
for
the
sin
of
adam
but
there
came
one
who
paid
the
penalty
of
our
sins
the
water
that
came
from
the
pierced
side
of
christ
was
baptism
xii
repentance
must
be
sought
by
prayer
with
sorrow
and
affliction
the
guilty
may
be
saved
by
contrition
two
sorts
of
people
are
saved
the
and
the
the
words
of
david
the
innocent
is
saved
by
right
the
words
of
solomon
david
says
no
man
living
is
justified
pray
to
be
saved
by
innocence
and
not
by
right
when
jesus
was
on
earth
little
children
were
brought
unto
him
the
disciples
rebuked
the
parents
christ
said
little
children
to
come
unto
me
etc
xiii
no
one
can
win
heaven
except
he
be
meek
as
a
child
the
pearl
of
price
is
like
the
kingdom
of
heaven
pure
and
clean
forsake
the
mad
world
and
purchase
the
spotless
pearl
the
father
of
the
maiden
desires
to
know
who
formed
her
figure
and
wrought
her
garments
her
beauty
he
says
is
not
natural
her
colour
passes
the
the
maiden
explains
to
her
father
that
she
is
a
bride
of
christ
she
is
without
spot
or
blemish
her
weeds
are
washed
in
the
blood
of
christ
the
father
asks
the
nature
of
the
lamb
that
has
chosen
his
daughter
and
why
she
is
selected
as
a
bride
xiv
the
lamb
has
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
brides
john
saw
them
on
the
hill
of
sion
in
a
dream
in
the
new
city
of
jerusalem
isaiah
speaks
of
christ
or
the
lamb
he
says
that
he
was
led
as
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
in
jerusalem
was
christ
slain
with
buffets
was
his
face
flayed
he
endured
all
patiently
as
a
lamb
for
us
he
died
in
jerusalem
the
declaration
of
john
the
lamb
of
god
etc
who
can
reckon
his
generation
that
died
in
jerusalem
in
the
new
jerusalem
john
saw
the
lamb
sitting
upon
the
throne
xv
the
lamb
is
without
blemish
every
spotless
soul
is
a
worthy
bride
for
the
lamb
no
strife
or
envy
among
the
brides
none
can
have
less
bliss
than
another
our
death
leads
us
to
bliss
what
john
saw
upon
the
mount
of
sion
about
the
lamb
he
saw
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
maidens
he
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
like
many
floods
he
heard
the
maiden
sing
a
new
song
so
did
the
four
beasts
and
the
elders
sad
of
this
assembly
was
like
the
lamb
spotless
and
pure
the
father
replies
to
the
maiden
he
says
he
is
but
dust
and
ashes
he
wishes
to
ask
one
question
whether
the
brides
have
their
abode
in
or
in
manor
xvi
jerusalem
he
says
in
judea
but
the
dwelling
of
the
brides
should
be
perfect
for
such
comely
a
great
castle
would
be
required
the
city
in
judæa
answers
the
maiden
is
where
christ
suffered
and
is
the
old
jerusalem
the
new
jerusalem
is
where
the
lamb
has
assembled
his
brides
jerusalem
means
the
city
of
god
in
the
old
city
our
peace
was
made
at
one
in
the
new
city
is
eternal
peace
xvii
the

women
the
better
and
the
worse
that
his

might
be
full

when

they
were
well
entertained
the
servants
tell
their
lord
that
they
have
done
his

and
there

for
those
who

was
so
bold

he
take
him
to

meun
tells
how
a
lady
is
to
be
loved
by
doing
what
pleases
her
best
love
thy
lord
conform
to
christ
who
is
polished
as
a
pearl
by
how
comely
a
contrivance
did
he
enter
the
womb
of
the
virgin
in
what
purity
did
he
part
from
her
no
abode
was
better
than
his
the
sorrow
of
childbirth
was
turned
to
joy
angels
solaced
the
virgin
with
organs
and
pipes
the
child
christ
was
so
clean
that
ox
and
ass
worshipped
him
he
hated
wickedness
and
would
never
touch
ought
that
was
vile
yet
there
came
to
him
lazars
and
lepers
lame
and
blind
dry
and
dropsical
folk
he
healed
all
with
kind
speech
his
handling
was
so
good
that
he
needed
no
knife
to
cut
or
carve
with
the
bread
he
broke
more
perfectly
than
could
all
the
tools
of
toulouse
how
can
we
approach
his
court
except
we
be
clean
god
is
merciful
through
penance
we
may
shine
as
a
pearl
why
is
the
pearl
so
prized
she
becomes
none
the
worse
for
wear
if
she
should
become
dim
wash
her
in
wine
she
then
becomes
clearer
than
before
so
may
the
sinner
polish
him
by
penance
beware
of
returning
to
sin
for
then
god
is
more
displeased
than
ever
the
reconciled
soul
god
holds
as
his
own
ill
deeds
rob
him
of
it
god
forbids
us
to
defile
any
vessels
used
in
his
service
in
time
the
defiling
of
vessels
brought
wrath
upon
the
king
xii
daniel
in
his
prophecies
tells
of
the
destruction
of
the
jews
for
their
unfaithfulness
in
following
other
gods

allowed
the
heathen
to
destroy
them
in
the
reign
of
zedekiah
who
practised
idolatry
nebuchadnezzar
becomes
his
foe
he
besieges
jerusalem
and
surrounds
the

the
city
is
stuffed
full
of
men
brisk
is
the
skirmish
seven
times
a
day
are
the
gates
assailed
for
two
years
the
fight
goes
on
yet
the
city
is
not
taken
the
folk
within
are
in
want
of
food
meager
they
become
for
so
shut
up
are
they
that
escape
seems
impossible
but
on
a
quiet
night
they
steal
out
and
rush
through
the
host
they
are
discovered
by
the
enemy
a
loud
alarm
is
given
they
are
pursued
and
overtaken
their
king
is
made
prisoner
his
chief
men
are
presented
as

placed
in
a
dungeon
in

all
for
his
against
the
lord
who
might
otherwise
have
been
his
friend
nebuchadnezzar
ceased
not
until
he
had
destroyed
jerusalem
nebuzaradan
was
of
the
the
best
men
were
taken
out
of
the
city
nevertheless
nebuzaradan
spared
not
those
left

of
bairns
were
spilt

pressed
to
death
wives
and

burst
open
the
temple
and
slew
those
therein
priests
pulled
by
the

slain
along
with
deacons

the
temple
of
its
pillars
of
brass
and
the
golden
candlestick
from
off
the
altar
goblets
basins
golden
dishes
all
are
taken
by

he
beats
down
and
returns
to
babylon
presents
the
prisoners
to
the
king
among
whom
were
daniel
and
his
three
companions
nebuchadnezzar
has
great
joy
because
his
enemies
are
slain
great
was
his
wonder
when
he
saw
the
sacred
jewelry
he
praises
the
god
of
israel
such
vessels
never
before
came
to
chaldea
they
are
thrust
into
the
treasury
nebuchadnezzar
reigns
as
emperor
of
all
the
earth
through
the
of
daniel
who
gave
him
good
counsel
nebuchadnezzar
dies
and
is
buried
belshazzar
succeeds
him
he
holds
himself
the
biggest
in
heaven
or
on
earth
he
honours
not
god
but
worships
false
phantoms
he
promises
them
rewards
if
good
fortune
befal
if
they
vex
him
he
knocks
them
in
pieces
he
has
a
wife
and
many
concubines
the
mind
of
the
king
was
fixed
upon
new
meats
and
other
vain
things
xiii
belshazzar
to
exhibit
his
vainglory
proclaims
throughout
babylon
that
all
the
great
ones
should
assemble
on
a
set
day
at
the
feast
kings
dukes
and
lords
were
commanded
to
attend
the
court
to
do
the
king
honour
many
nobles
came
to
babylon
it
would
take
too
long
to
name
the
number
the
city
of
babylon
is
broad
and
big
it
is
situated
on
a
plain
surrounded
by
seven
streams
a
high
wall
and
towers
the
palace
was
long
and
large
each
side
being
seven
miles
in
length
high
houses
were
within
the
walls
the
time
of
the
feast
has
come
belshazzar
sits
upon
his
throne
the
hall
floor
is
covered
with
knights
when
all
are
seated
service
begins
trumpets
sound
everywhere
bread
is
served
upon
silver
dishes
all
sorts
of
musical
instruments
are
heard
in
the
hall
the
king
surrounded
by
his
loves
drinks
copiously
of
wine
it
gets
into
his
head
and
stupifies
him
a
cursed
thought
takes
possession
of
him
he
commands
his
marshal
to
bring
him
the
vessels
taken
from
the
temple
by
nebuchadnezzar
and
to
fill
them
with
wine
the
marshal
opens
the
chests
covers
the
cupboard
with
vessels
the
jewels
of
jerusalem
deck
the
sides
of
the
hall
the
altar
and
crown
blessed
by
hands
and
anointed
with
the
blood
of
beasts
are
set
before
the
bold
belshazzar
upon
this
altar
were
noble
vessels
curiously
carved
basins
of
gold
cups
arrayed
like
castles
with
battlements
and
towers
with
lofty
pinnacles
upon
them
were
pourtrayed
branches
and
leaves
the
flowers
of
which
were
white
pearls
and
the
fruit
flaming
gems
the
goblets
were
ornamented
with
flowers
of
gold
the
candlestick
was
brought
in
with
its
pillars
of
brass
and
ornamental
boughs
upon
which
sat
birds
of
various
hues
lights
shone
bright
from
the
candlestick
which
once
stood
before
the
of
the
pollution
of
the
sacred
vessels
is
displeasing
to
god
for
boaster
on
drinks
from
them
till
he
is
as
as
the
god
is
very
angry
before
harming
the
revellers
he
sends
them
a
warning
belshazzar
commands
the
sacred
vessels
to
be
filled
with
wine
the
cups
and
bowls
are
soon
filled
music
of
all
kind
is
heard
in
the
hall
dukes
princes
concubines
and
knights
all
are
merry
drinking
of
the
sweet
liquors
they
ask
favours
of
their
gods
who
although
dumb
are
as
highly
praised
if
heaven
were
a
marvel
befals
the
feasters
the
king
first
saw
it
upon
the
plain
wall
palm
with
pointel
in
is
seen
writing
the
bold
belshazzar
becomes
frightened
his
knees
knock
together
he
roars
for
dread
still
beholding
the
hand
as
it
wrote
on
the
rough
wall
the
hand
vanishes
but
the
letters
remain
the
king
recovers
his
speech
and
sends
for
the
but
none
of
the
scholars
were
wise
enough
to
read
it
belshazzar
is
nearly
mad
commands
the
city
to
be
searched
throughout
for
the
of
he
who
expounds
the
strange
letters
shall
be
clothed
in
of
a
collar
of
gold
shall
encircle
his
throat
he
shall
be
the
third
lord
in
the
realm
as
soon
as
this
cry
was
upcast
to
the
hall
came
clerks
out
of
chaldea
witches
and
diviners
sorcerers
and
exorcists
but
after
looking
on
the
letters
they
were
as
ignorant
as
if
they
had
looked
into
the
leather
of
the
left
boot
the
king
curses
them
all
and
calls
them
churls
he
orders
the
harlots
to
be
hanged
the
queen
hears
the
king
chide
she
inquires
the
cause
goes
to
the
king
kneels
before
him
and
asks
why
he
has
rent
his
robes
for
grief
when
there
is
one
that
has
the
spirit
of
god
the
counsellor
of
nebuchadnezzar
the
interpreter
of
his
dreams
through
the
holy
spirit
of
god
the
name
of
this
man
is
daniel
who
was
brought
a
captive
from
judæa
the
queen
tells
the
king
to
send
for
daniel
her
counsel
is
accepted
daniel
comes
before
belshazzar
the
king
tells
him
that
he
has
heard
of
his
wisdom
and
his
power
to
discover
hidden
things
and
that
he
wants
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
writing
on
the
wall
promises
him
if
he
can
explain
the
text
of
the
letters
and
their
interpretation
to
clothe
him
in
purple
and
pall
and
put
a
ring
about
his
neck
and
to
make
him
baron
upon
daniel
addresses
the
king
and
reminds
him
how
that
god
supported
his
father
and
gave
him
power
to
exalt
or
abase
whomsoever
he
pleased
nebuchadnezzar
was
established
on
account
of
his
faith
in
god
so
long
as
he
remained
true
no
man
was
greater
but
at
last
pride
touches
his
heart
he
forgets
the
power
of
god
and
blasphemes
his
name
he
says
that
he
is
of
the
ground
and
the
builder
of
babylon
hardly
had
nebuchadnezzar
spoken
when
voice
is
heard
saying
principality
is
departed
thou
removed
from
men
must
abide
on
the
moor
and
walk
with
wild
beasts
eat
herbs
and
dwell
with
wolves
and
for
his
pride
he
becomes
an
outcast
he
believes
himself
to
be
a
bull
or
an
ox
goes
all
fours
like
a
cow
for
seven
summers
his
thighs
grew
thick
his
hair
became
matted
and
thick
from
the
shoulders
to
the
toes
his
beard
touched
the
earth
his
brows
were
like
briars
his
eyes
were
hollow
and
grey
as
the
he
was
at
last
he
recovered
his
and
believed
in
god
then
soon
was
he
restored
to
his
seat
but
thou
belshazzar
hast
disregarded
these
signs
and
hast
blasphemed
the
lord
defiled
his
vessels
filling
them
with
wine
for
thy
wenches
and
praising
thy
lifeless
gods
for
this
sin
god
has
sent
thee
this
strange
sight
the
fist
with
the
fingers
writing
on
the
wall
these
are
the
words
tekel
peres
god
has
counted
thy
kingdom
and
finished
it
thy
reign
is
weighed
and
is
found
wanting
in
deeds
of
faith
thy
kingdom
is
divided
and
given
to
the
persians
the
medes
shall
be
masters
the
king
commands
daniel
to
be
clothed
in
a
frock
of
fine
cloth
soon
is
he
arrayed
in
purple
with
a
chain
about
his
neck
a
decree
is
made
that
all
should
bow
to
him
as
the
third
lord
that
followed
belshazzar
the
decree
was
made
known
and
all
were
glad
the
day
however
past
night
came
on
before
another
day
dawned
words
were
fulfilled
the
feast
lasts
till
the
sun
falls
the
skies
become
dark
each
noble
hies
home
to
his
supper
belshazzar
is
carried
to
bed
but
never
rises
from
it
for
his
foes
are
seeking
to
destroy
his
land
and
are
assembled
suddenly
the
enemy
is
darius
leader
of
the
medes
he
has
legions
of
armed
men
under
cover
of
the
darkness
they
cross
the
river
by
means
of
ladders
they
get
upon
the
walls
and
within
an
hour
enter
the
city
without
disturbing
any
of
the
watch
they
run
into
the
palace
and
raise
a
great
cry
men
are
slain
in
their
beds
belshazzar
is
beaten
to
death
and
caught
by
the
heels
is
foully
cast
into
a
ditch
darius
is
crowned
king
and
makes
peace
with
the
barons
thus
the
land
was
lost
for
the
sin
he
was
cursed
for
his
uncleanness
and
deprived
of
his
honour
as
well
as
of
the
joys
of
heaven
thus
in
three
ways
has
it
been
shown
that
uncleanness
makes
god
angry
cleanness
is
his
comfort
the
seemly
shall
see
his
face
god
give
us
grace
to
serve
in
his
sight
patience
sidenotes
patience
is
often
displeasing
but
it
assuages
heavy
hearts
and
quenches
malice
happiness
follows
sorrow
it
is
better
to
suffer
than
to
be
angry
matthew
tells
us
of
the
promises
made
by
christ
blessed
are
the
poor
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
blessed
are
the
meek
for
they
shall
the
blessed
are
the
mourners
for
they
shall
be
comforted
blessed
are
the
hungry
for
they
shall
be
filled
blessed
are
the
merciful
for
mercy
shall
be
their
reward
blessed
are
the
clean
of
heart
for
they
shall
see
the
saviour
blessed
are
the
for
they
shall
be
called
sons
blessed
are
they
that
live
aright
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
these
blessings
are
promised
to
those
who
follow
poverty
pity
penance
meekness
mercy
chastity
peace
and
patience
poverty
and
patience
are
to
be
treated
together
they
are
in
one
form
and
have
one
meed
poverty
will
dwell
where
she
lists
and
man
must
needs
suffer
poverty
and
patience
are
what
avails
impatience
if
god
send
affliction
patience
is
best
did
not
jonah
incur
danger
by
his
folly
ii
jonah
was
a
prophet
of
the
gentiles
word
came
to
him
saying
quickly
take
the
way
to
nineveh
say
that
which
i
shall
put
in
thine
heart
wickedness
dwells
in
that
city
go
swiftly
and
carry
my
jonah
is
full
of
wrath
he
is
afraid
that
the
shrews
will
put
him
in
the
stocks
or
put
out
his
eyes
he
thinks
that
god
desires
his
death
he
determines
not
to
go
near
the
city
but
fly
to
tarshish
grumbling
he
goes
to
port
joppa
he
says
that
god
will
not
be
able
to
protect
him
jonah
reaches
the
port
finds
a
ship
ready
to
sail
the
seamen
catch
up
the
fasten
the
cables
weigh
their
anchors
and
spread
sail
a
gentle
wind
wafts
the
ship
along
was
never
a
jew
so
joyful
as
was
jonah
then
he
has
however
put
himself
in
peril
in
fleeing
from
god
the
words
of
david
does
he
not
hear
who
made
all
ears
he
is
not
blind
that
formed
each
eye
jonah
is
now
in
no
dread
he
is
however
soon
overtaken
the
wielder
of
all
things
has
devices
at
will
he
commands
eurus
and
aquilo
to
blow
the
winds
blow
obedient
to
his
word
out
of
the
the
noise
begins
storms
arose
winds
wrestled
together
the
waves
rolled
high
and
never
rested
then
was
jonah
joyless
the
boat
reeled
around
the
gear
became
out
of
order
ropes
and
mast
were
broken
a
loud
cry
is
raised
many
a
lad
labours
to
lighten
the
ship
they
throw
overboard
their
bags
and
feather
beds
but
still
the
wind
rages
and
the
waves
become
wilder
each
man
calls
upon
his
god
some
called
upon
vernagu
diana
and
neptune
to
the
sun
and
to
the
moon
then
said
one
of
the
sailors
lawless
wretch
that
has
grieved
his
god
is
in
the
ship
i
advise
that
we
lay
lots
upon
each
man
when
the
guilty
is
gone
the
tempest
may
this
is
agreed
to
all
are
assembled
from
all
corners
of
the
ship
save
jonah
the
jew
who
had
fled
into
the
bottom
of
the
boat
there
he
falls
asleep
soon
he
is
aroused
and
brought
on
board
full
roughly
is
he
questioned
the
lot
falls
upon
jonah
then
quickly
they
said
the
devil
hast
thou
done
doted
wretch
what
seekest
thou
on
the
sea
hast
thou
no
god
to
call
upon
of
what
land
art
thou
thou
art
doomed
for
thy
ill
jonah
says
am
a
hebrew
a
worshipper
of
the
creator
all
this
mischief
is
caused
by
me
therefore
cast
me
he
proves
to
them
that
he
was
guilty
the
mariners
are
exceedingly
frightened
they
try
to
make
way
with
their
oars
but
their
endeavours
are
useless
jonah
must
be
doomed
to
death
they
pray
to
god
that
they
may
not
shed
innocent
blood
jonah
is
cast
overboard
the
tempest
ceases
and
the
sea
settles
the
stiff
streams
drive
the
ship
about
at
last
they
reach
a
bank
the
seamen
thank
god
and
perform
solemn
vows
jonah
is
in
great
dread
iii
jonah
is
shoved
from
the
ship
a
wild
whale
swims
by
the
boat
he
opens
his
swallow
and
seizes
the
prophet
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
jonah
suffered
woe
the
prophet
is
without
hope
cold
was
his
comfort
jonah
was
only

entered
in
by
the
gills
and
by
means
of
one
of
the
intestines
of
the
fish
came
into
a
space
as
large
as
a
hall

prophet
fixes
his
feet
firmly
in
the
belly
of
the
whale
he
searches
into
every
nook
of
its
navel
the
prophet
calls
upon
god
he
cries
for
mercy
he
sits
safely
in
a
recess
in
a
bowel
of
the
beast
for
three
days
and
three
nights
the
whale
passes
through
many
a
rough
region

prophet
prays
to
god
in
this
wise

i
cried
out

thou
dippedst
me
in
the
sea
thy
great
floods
passed
over
me
the
streams
drive
over
me
i
am
cast
out
from
thy
sight
the
abyss
binds
me
the
rushing
waves
play
on
my
head
thou
possessest
my
life
in
my
anguish
i
remembered
my
god
and
besought
his
pity
when
i
am
delivered
from
this
danger
i
will
obey
thy
god
speaks
fiercely
to
the
whale
and
he
vomits
out
the
prophet
on
a
dry
space

has
need
to
wash
his
clothes
word
comes
to
the
prophet
he
is
told
to
preach
in
nineveh
by
night

the
city

was
a
very
great
city
jonah
delivers
his
message
forty
days
and
nineveh
shall
come
to
an
end
it
shall
be
turned
upside
down
and
swallowed
quickly
by
the
black
this
speech
spreads
throughout
the
city
great
fear
seizes
all
the
people
mourn
secretly
clothe
themselves
in
sackcloth
and
cast
ashes
upon
their
heads
the
message
reaches
the
ears
of
the
king
he
rends
his
robes
clothes
himself
in
sackloth
and
mourns
in
the
dust
he
issues
a
decree
that
all
in
the
city
men
beasts
women
and
children
prince
priest
and
prelates
should
fast
for
their
sins
children
are
to
be
weaned
from
the
breast
the
ox
is
to
have
no
hay
nor
the
horse
any
water
who
can
tell
if
god
will
have
mercy
though
he
is
mighty
he
is
merciful
and
may
forgive
us
our
guilt
all
believed
and
repented
god
forgave
them
through
his
goodness
much
sorrow
settles
upon
jonah
he
becomes
very
angry
he
prays
to
god
and
says
not
this
my
saying
when
thy
message
reached
me
in
my
own
country
i
knew
thy
great
goodness
thy
and
thy
mercy
i
knew
these
men
might
make
their
peace
with
thee
therefore
i
fled
unto
tarshish
take
my
life
from
me
o
lord
it
is
better
for
me
to
die
than
god
upbraids
jonah
saying
this
right
to
be
so
wroth
jonah
jangling
uprises
and
makes
himself
a
bower
of
hay
and
to
shield
him
from
the
sun
he
slept
heavily
all
night
god
prepared
a
woodbine
jonah
awakes
and
is
exceedingly
glad
of
the
bower
the
prophet
under
its
gracious
leaves
is
protected
from
the
rays
jonah
wishes
he
had
such
a
lodge
in
his
own
country
god
prepared
a
worm
that
made
the
woodbine
wither
jonah
awakes
and
finds
his
woodbine
destroyed
the
leaves
were
all
faded
the
sun
beat
upon
the
head
of
jonah
he
is
exceedingly
angry
and
prays
god
that
he
may
die
god
rebukes
the
prophet
thou
well
he
says
be
angry
for
the
gourd
jonah
replies
would
i
were
god
asks
if
it
is
to
be
wondered
at
that
he
should
help
his
handy
work
is
not
jonah
angry
that
his
woodbine
is
destroyed
which
cost
him
no
labour
god
is
not
to
be
blamed
for
taking
pity
upon
people
that
he
made
should
he
destroy
nineveh
the
sorrow
of
such
a
sweet
place
would
sink
to
his
heart
in
the
city
there
are
little
bairns
who
have
done
no
wrong
and
there
are
others
who
can
not
discern
between
their
right
hand
and
their
left
hand
there
are
also
dumb
beasts
in
the
city
incapable
of
sinning
judgment
must
be
tempered
with
mercy
he
that
is
too
hasty
to
rend
his
clothes
must
afterwards
sit
with
worse
ones
to
sew
them
together
poverty
and
pain
must
be
endured
patience
is
a
noble
point
though
it
displeases
oft
