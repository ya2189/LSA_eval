to
him
who
has
never
called
a
dog
his
friend
the
full
meaning
of
pure
friendship
is
unknown
i
have
brought
together
in
my
library
a
few
of
the
many
proofs
that
show
how
true
is
the
affection
which
many
of
your
masters
have
for
you
and
when
i
can
read
them
to
you
privately
you
will
understand
more
fully
the
place
you
hold
in
our
lives
i
use
the
word
master
only
because
our
language
is
too
poor
to
express
in
one
word
the
real
relationship
which
exists
between
us
we
the
master
and
you
the
devoted
slave
and
trusted
servant
the
most
joyful
of
playfellows
and
the
best
of
companions
the
bravest
defender
and
the
truest
friend
i
wish
i
knew
the
word
in
your
language
which
expresses
all
that
you
are
to
us
i
also
wish
i
knew
how
much
you
know
and
could
learn
the
many
things
you
would
gladly
teach
us
you
can
see
what
we
can
not
see
you
can
hear
sounds
we
can
not
hear
you
interpret
signs
we
can
not
read
you
scent
the
trails
we
can
not
find
you
talk
to
us
with
your
speaking
eyes
and
we
can
not
understand
you
are
sometimes
cruelly
treated
and
so
are
human
beings
and
sometimes
we
have
to
punish
you
for
you
are
not
always
good
you
have
a
certain
amount
of
deviltry
in
your
nature
which
we
rather
like
for
it
makes
you
more
human
and
lovable
your
sins
however
are
mostly
against
the
laws
we
have
made
for
you
not
against
your
own
or
those
of
nature
which
are
the
laws
of
a
higher
power
than
ours
the
one
who
made
you
what
glorious
times
have
we
enjoyed
together
tramping
or
riding
through
the
fields
and
woods
over
the
hills
and
by
the
streams
and
through
the
swamps
or
at
the
sea
on
the
sands
and
rocks
or
over
the
salt
marshes
with
gun
or
camera
or
botany
box
or
with
nothing
at
all
we
have
shared
the
best
the
world
can
give
us
nature
gifts
and
returning
home
tired
and
happy
we
in
the
evening
before
a
bright
wood
fire
you
close
by
our
side
or
at
our
feet
only
so
that
you
can
touch
us
have
lived
over
what
the
day
has
given
us
or
sometimes
at
night
before
a
camp
fire
with
the
quiet
of
the
wood
sounds
all
about
us
have
dreamed
of
the
ducks
and
the
grouse
and
the
partridges
or
of
rare
flowers
or
a
beautiful
landscape
which
the
past
day
has
brought
or
of
what
the
next
day
will
bring
and
perhaps
you
have
dreamed
also
a
little
selfishly
you
are
only
selfish
in
your
dreams
of
the
rabbits
and
squirrels
and
the
woodchucks
which
have
been
the
greatest
temptation
for
you
to
resist
all
day
long
they
must
have
existed
long
ago
in
your
garden
of
eden
no
matter
what
our
conditions
or
surroundings
in
life
may
be
you
accept
them
gladly
king
or
peasant
palace
or
hovel
riches
or
poverty
plenty
or
starvation
burning
sun
or
ice
and
snow
if
you
have
once
given
us
your
affection
no
matter
who
or
what
your
master
may
be
you
give
him
all
you
have
to
give
to
the
very
end
even
life
itself
it
would
almost
seem
that
you
were
created
only
to
serve
us
for
wherever
man
has
been
even
in
the
far
past
where
history
is
almost
a
myth
you
have
been
also
close
by
his
side
old
egypt
persia
greece
and
ancient
rome
have
told
of
your
fidelity
and
of
your
devotion
you
know
us
in
many
ways
as
no
human
being
knows
us
for
every
hour
of
your
life
you
wish
to
be
near
and
often
you
are
our
most
intimate
companion
and
the
best
friend
we
have
in
the
world
we
talk
to
you
more
than
half
believing
or
trying
to
believe
that
you
understand
and
i
am
not
sure
but
that
to
you
alone
we
always
tell
the
absolute
truth
we
whisper
to
you
our
secrets
we
confide
to
you
our
hopes
and
ambitions
we
tell
you
of
our
successes
and
our
disappointments
and
often
in
deep
grief
you
alone
see
what
we
think
is
weakness
to
show
to
the
outside
world
whatever
happens
to
us
we
are
sure
of
one
friend
even
if
the
whole
world
is
against
us
we
trust
to
you
our
greatest
treasures
our
children
and
we
know
with
you
they
are
safe
when
you
go
to
the
happy
hunting
ground
you
are
truly
and
deeply
mourned
and
the
great
legacy
you
leave
us
is
the
memory
of
your
loyalty
your
devotion
your
trust
and
memory
of
the
many
happy
hours
and
happy
days
you
have
given
us
in
your
too
short
life
and
when
we
are
obliged
to
say
the
king
is
dead
we
do
not
complete
the
old
saying
long
live
the
king
for
many
many
months
and
sometimes
never
may
we

again

masters

collection
is
composed
almost
entirely
of
verses
that
have
been
written
within
the
last
years
i
know
only
too
well
that
i
have
omitted
many
poems
that
the
dogs
should
hear

i

not
attempted

done
several

also
know

ask
why

of
your

only
a
small
number

only
a
few

fidele
grassy

from
island
by
henry
newbolt
by
permission
of
the
author
and
of
the
publishers
elkin
mathews
london
fidele
grassy
tomb
the
squire
sat
propped
in
a
pillowed
chair
his
eyes
were
alive
and
clear
of
care
but
well
he
knew
that
the
hour
was
come
to
bid
to
his
ancient
home
he
looked
on
garden
wood
and
hill
he
looked
on
the
lake
sunny
and
still
the
last
of
earth
that
his
eyes
could
see
was
the
island
church
of
orchardleigh
the
last
that
his
heart
could
understand
was
the
touch
of
the
tongue
that
licked
his
hand
bury
the
dog
at
my
feet
he
said
and
his
voice
dropped
and
the
squire
was
dead
now
the
dog
was
a
hound
of
the
danish
breed
staunch
to
love
and
strong
at
need
he
had
dragged
his
master
safe
to
shore
when
the
tide
was
ebbing
at
elsinore
from
that
day
forth
as
reason
would
he
was
named
fidele
and
made
it
good
when
the
last
of
the
mourners
left
the
door
fidele
was
dead
on
the
chantry
floor
they
buried
him
there
at
his
master
feet
and
all
that
heard
of
it
deemed
it
meet
the
story
went
the
round
for
years
till
it
came
at
last
to
the
bishop
ears
bishop
of
bath
and
wells
was
he
lord
of
the
lords
of
orchardleigh
and
he
wrote
to
the
parson
the
strongest
screed
that
bishop
may
write
or
parson
read
the
sum
of
it
was
that
a
soulless
hound
was
known
to
be
buried
in
hallowed
ground
from
scandal
sore
the
church
to
save
they
must
take
the
dog
from
his
master
grave
the
heir
was
far
in
a
foreign
land
the
parson
was
wax
to
my
lord
command
he
sent
for
the
sexton
and
bade
him
make
a
lonely
grave
by
the
shore
of
the
lake
the
sexton
sat
by
the
water
brink
where
he
used
to
sit
when
he
used
to
think
he
reasoned
slow
but
he
reasoned
it
out
and
his
argument
left
him
free
from
doubt
a
bishop
he
said
is
the
top
of
his
trade
but
there
others
can
give
him
a
start
with
the
spade
yon
dog
he
carried
the
squire
ashore
and
a
christian
could
ha
done
no
more
the
grave
was
dug
the
mason
came
and
carved
on
stone
fidele
name
but
the
dog
that
the
sexton
laid
inside
was
a
dog
that
never
had
lived
or
died
so
the
parson
was
praised
and
the
scandal
stayed
till
a
long
time
after
the
church
decayed
and
laying
the
floor
anew
they
found
in
the
tomb
of
the
squire
the
bones
of
a
hound
as
for
the
bishop
of
bath
and
wells
no
more
of
him
the
story
tells
doubtless
he
lived
as
a
prelate
and
prince
and
died
and
was
buried
a
century
since
and
whether
his
view
was
right
or
wrong
has
little
to
do
with
this
my
song
something
we
owe
him
you
must
allow
and
perhaps
he
has
changed
his
mind
by
now
the
squire
in
the
family
chantry
sleeps
the
marble
still
his
memory
keeps
remember
when
the
name
you
spell
there
rest
fidele
bones
as
well
for
the
sexton
grave
you
need
not
search
is
a
nameless
mound
by
the
island
church
an
ignorant
fellow
of
humble
lot
but
he
knew
one
thing
that
a
bishop
did
not

leo
the
shaggy
the
lustrous
the
giant
the
gentle
newfoundland
dark
are
his
eyes
as
the
night
and
black
is
his
hair
as
the
midnight
large
and
slow
is
his
tread
till
he
sees
his

returning
then
how
he
leaps
in
the
air
with
motion
ponderous
frightening
now
as
i
pass
to
my
work
i
hear
the
roar
of
the
city
far
over
the
roofs
of
the
houses
i
hear
the
barking
of
leo
for
me
he
is
moaning
and
crying
for
me
in
measure
sonorous
he
raises
his
marvelous
voice
for
me
he
is
wailing
and
calling
none
can
assuage
his
grief
tho
but
for
a
day
is
the
parting
tho
morn
after
morn
is
the
same
tho
home
every
night
comes
his
master
still
will
he
grieve
when
we
sever
and
wild
will
be
his
rejoicing
when
at
night
his
master
returns
and
lays
but
a
hand
on
his
forehead
no
lack
will
there
be
in
the
world
of
faith
of
love
and
devotion
no
lack
for
me

mine

thee

all
that

all
that

were

into
no

four
years
those

ways

thy

yearn

us
to
pet
thee
or
to
praise
dear
little
friend
at
every
turn
that
loving
heart
that
patient
soul
had

indeed
no
longer
span
to
run
their
course
and
reach
their
goal
and
read
their
homily
to
man
that
liquid
melancholy

whose
pathetic
springs
seem
surging
the
virgilian
cry
a
the
sense
of
tears
in
mortal
things
that
steadfast
mournful
strain
consoled
by
spirits
gloriously
gay
and
temper
of
heroic
mould
what
was
four
years
their
whole
short

yes
only
four
and
not

thou
when
struck
thine
hour
to
go
on
us
who
stood
despondent
by
a
meek
last
glance
of
love
didst
throw
and
humbly
lay
thee
down
to
die
yet
would
we
keep
thee
in
our
heart
would
fix
our
favourite
on
the
scene
nor
let
thee
utterly
depart
and
be
as
if
thou
hadst
been
and
so
there
rise
these
lines
of
verse
on
lips
that
rarely
form
them
now
while
to
each
other
we
rehearse
ways
such
arts
such
looks
hadst
thou
we
stroke
thy
broad
brown
paws
again
we
bid
thee
to
thy
vacant
chair
we
greet
thee
by
the
we
hear
thy
scuffle
on
the
stair
we
see
the
flaps
of
thy
large
ears
quick
raised
to
ask
which
way
we
go
crossing
the
frozen
lake
appears
thy
small
black
figure
on
the
snow
nor

who
mourn
thee
in
thine
english
home
thou
hast
thine
absent
master
tear
dropt
by
the
far
australian
foam
thy
memory
lasts
both
here
and
there
and
thou
shalt
live
as
long
as

after
that

thee
yet
fondly

for
thy
fame
even
to
a
date
beyond
our
own
we
strive
to
carry
down
thy
name
by
mounded
turf
and
graven
stone
we
lay
thee
close
within
our
reach
here
where
the
grass
is
smooth
and
warm
between
the
holly
and
the
beech
where
oft
we
watch
thy
couchant
form
asleep

was

i
did

you
no

came

wide
strap
about
your
neck
a

one
with
a
huge
buckle

bigger

pitched

you

you
were

you
were

black

for
you
had
chosen
me
to
be
your

my
whistle
was
your
law
you
put
your
paw
upon
my
palm
and
in
your
calm
deep
eyes
was
writ
the
promise
of
long
comradeship
when
i
came
home
from
work
late
and
always
i
heard
the
patter
of
your
feet
upon
the
oaken
stairs
your
nose
was
at
the
and
whether
i
been
bad
or
good
that
day
you
fawned
and
loved
me
just
the
same
it
was
your
way
to
understand
and
if
i
struck
you
my
harsh
hand
was
wet
with
your
caresses
you
took
my
leavings
crumb
and
bone
and
stuck
by
me
through
thick
and
thin
you
were
my
kin
and
then
one
day
you
died
at
least
that
what
they
said
there
was
a
box
and
you
were
in
it
still
with
a
sprig
of
myrtle
and
your
leash
and

and
put
deep

you
sleep

far
than
i
to
him
whom
god
i
know

own
his
eye
deep
brown
and
liquid
watches
for
my
nod
he
is
more
patient
underneath
the

than
i
when
god
his
wise
corrections
sends
he
looks
love
at
me
deep
as
words
spake
and
from
me
never
crumb
or
sup
will
take
but
he
wags
thanks
with
his
most
vocal
tail
and
when
some
crashing
noise
wakes
all
his
fear
he
is
content
and
quiet
if
i
near
secure
that
my
protection
will
prevail
so
faithful
mindful
thankful
trustful
he
tells
me
what
i
unto
my
god
should
be
may
he
had
lived
out
his
life
but
not
his
love
daily
up
steep
and
weary
stair
he
came
his
big
heart
bursting
with
the
strain
to
prove
his
loneliness
without
me
just
the
same
old
word
of
greeting
beamed
in
his
deep
eye
with
a
new
look
of
wonder
in
it
asking
why
the
whole
creation
groans
and
travails
he
and
i
there
faced
the
mystery
of
pain
finding
me
dumb
and
helpless
down
again
he
went
unanswered
with
the
dawn
to
die

i

of

in

abandon
there

tossed
my

sitting
gravely
on

espied
a

stalked
it
