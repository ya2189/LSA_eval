sir
david

plays
the
like
and
wins
it
by

a
most

well
come
away
they
one
ahead
but
we
have
four
to

we
win

they
over

come
there
another
baird
plays
a

we
hole
at

they
stare

now
the

is

we

but
told
our

to
clean
the
balls
and

in

the

we
play
like

three
notes

with
you
we

again

in

is

with

give
me
the

either
party
cries

baird

the

thus
with

one
to
play
is
even
all
is
strange
and
yet
there
can
not

that
such
a
snob
should
put
a

out
the
noble
lion
thus
in
all

stung

roars

aside
clan

never

noise
but
said

very

these

not

now
baird
and

in

off
and
play
two
strokes
the
best
that
have
been
seen
his
spoon
next
saddell

and

mine
should
have
been
as
good
but
for
a

baird
plays
the

it
all
but
in

five
yards
good

holes
the

my

self
and

all
three
are

we
lose
the

all

if
he
should
wake

he
shake
and
look
about
and
tell
each
young
beginner
i
gie
nae
mair
as
i
a
sinner
he
leaves
a
son
and
allan
is
his
name
in
golfing
far
beyond
his
father
fame
tho
in
diplomacy
i
shrewdly
guess
his
skill
inferior
and
his
fame
is
less
now
for
the
old
perchance
or
new
but
whom
my
former
strain
did
not
review
i
name
an
patton
tom
of
perth
short
stout
but
of
sterling
worth
a
golfer
perfect
something
it
may
be
the
worse
for
but
few
so
true
as
he
when
behind
as
when
ahead
and
drinks
like
blazes
till
he
goes
to
bed
his
friend
is
peddie
not
an
awful
swiper
but
at
the
putting
he
a
very
give
him
a
man
to
drive
him
through
the
green
and
he
be
bad
to
beat
it
will
be
seen
patton
and
peddie
peddie
and
patton
are
just
the
people
one
should
bet
upon
there
keith
with
andrew
wauchope
works
away
and
most
respectable
the
game
they
play
the
navy
captain
steadiness
and
age
give
him
perhaps
the
but
i
engage
ere
some
few
months
or
rather
weeks
are
fled
youth
and
activity
will
take
the
lead
see
gilmour
next
and
he
can
drive
a
ball
as
far
as
any
man
among
them
all
in
can
lead
the
van
and
is
throughout
a
perfect
gentleman
next
comes
a
handsome
man
with
roman
nose
and
whiskers
dark
wolfe
murray
i
suppose
he
has
begun
but
lately
still
he
plays
a
fairish
game
and
therefore
merits
praise
ask
him
when
at
his
and
he
will
say
is
bad
but
lord
how
i
play
another
man
with
whiskers
stout
and
strong
a
golfer
too
who
swipes
his
balls
along
and
well
he
putts
but
i
should
simply
say
his
better
than
his
play
dundas
can
sing
a
song
or
glee
or
catch
i
think
far
better
than
he
makes
a
match
but
who
is
he
whose
hairy
lips
betray
hussar
or
lancer
muse
oh
kindly
say
is
captain
feilden
lord
how
hard
he
hits
is
strange
he
does
not
knock
the
ball
to
bits
sometimes
he
hits
it
fair
and
makes
a
stroke
whose
distance
saddell
envy
might
provoke
but
take
his
play
the
worst
that
ever
play
golf
might
give
him
and
beat
him
clever
bad
tho
he
be
the
captain
has
done
more
than
ever
man
who
play
at
golf
before
ball
he
drove
was
in
despair
wide
of
the
hole
indeed
but
kill
a
ah
captain
campbell
old
schehallion
see
most
have
play
longer
few
so
well
as
he
a
sterling
highlander
and
that
no
trifle
so
thinks
the
a
workman
with
a
rifle
keeps
open
house
a
very
proper
thing
and
tho
rheumatic
like
a
king
sir
thomas
of
moncrieffe
i
can
not
doubt
but
he
will
be
a
golfer
tho
now
perhaps
he
off
and
careless
too
his
misses
numerous
his
hits
are
few
but
he
is
zealous
and
the
time
will
be
when
few
will
better
play
the
game
than
he
balbirnie
and
makgill
will
both
be
good
strong
active
lathy
fellows
so
they
should
but
for
john
grant
a
clever
fellow
too
i
really
fear
that
golf
will
never
do
is
strange
indeed
for
he
can
paint
and
ride
and
hunt
the
hounds
and
many
a
thing
beside
amuse
his
friends
with
anecdote
and
fun
but
when
he
takes
his
club
in
hand
he
stay
i
retract
since
writing
the
above
i
seen
him
play
a
better
game
by
jove
so
much
beyond
what
one
could
have
believ
that
i
confess
myself
for
once
deceived
and
if
he
can
go
on
the
season
through
there
still
a
that
he
may
really
i
kept
a
man
in
for
the
last
not
an
old
golfer
but
by
few
surpassed
great
captain
fairlie
when
he
drives
a
ball
one
of
his
for
he
do
hit
them
all
it
then
requires
no
common
stretch
of
sight
to
watch
its
progress
and
to
see
it
light
one
moment
i
another
to
define
a
famous
sportsman
and
a
judge
of
wine
whom
faithful
offers
to
my
view
he
made
the
game
a
study
it
is
true
still
many
play
as
well
but
for
john
buckle
fairly
beggars
competition
and
now
farewell
i
am
the
worse
for
wear
grey
is
my
jacket
growing
grey
my
hair
and
though
my
play
is
pretty
much
the
same
mine
is
at
best
a
despicable
game
but
still
i
like
it
still
delight
to
sing
clubs
players
caddies
balls
and
everything
but
all
that
bright
must
fade
and
we
who
play
like
those
before
us
soon
must
pass
away
yet
it
requires
no
prophet
skill
to
trace
the
royal
game
thro
each
succeeding
race
while
on
the
tide
of
generations
flows
it
still
shall
bloom
a
rose
and
still
andrews
links
with
flags
unfurl
shall
peerless
reign
and
challenge
all
the
world

nine
holes
of
the

the

philp

every

dear
where
we

to
be

although
in
lands
most
distant
we
sojourn

its

the

the

sly
grimace
whispering

road

in

so
is
it
often
in
the
grander
game
of
life
when
eager
hoping
for
the
palm
breathing
of
honour
joy
and
love
and
fame
conscious
of
nothing
like
a
doubt
or
qualm

here
if

thee
doubtless
for

when

past
thou
seemest
and
a
half
o

the
ball
goes
crooked
making
thy
foe
just
one

a
stroke
to
be

but
here
the
eden
on
your
vision
gleams
lovely
but
in
its
solemn
flow
the
hole
is
perched
aloft
too
near
the
tide
the
green
is
small
and
broken
is
the
ground
which
doth
that
little
charmed

not
too
far
and
go

take
the

spoon
to

you

the

oh
it

are

the
