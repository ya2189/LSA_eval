entered
according
to
act
of
parliament
of
canada
in
the
year
of
our
lord
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
ninety
by
wm
drysdale
in
the
office
of
the
minister
of
agriculture
dedicated
to
my
father
motive
worthless
the
man
who
works
he
knows
not
why
whom
naught
inspires
to
his
puny
plan
who
seeming
plays
his
part
instinctively
soulless
and
falsely
designated
man
wicked
who
works
from
wish
of
worldly
gain
his
soul
surrendered
to
lust
of
pleasure
partial
briefly
to
remain
of
treasure
liable
to
moth
and
rust
foolish
and
vain
is
he
whose
motive
fame
ruled
by
desire
of
honor
and
renown
and
fondly
courting
fortune
fickle
dame
she
smiles
she
will
frown
but
virtuous
noble
prompted
from
above
preluding
now
the
perfect
life
again
is
he
whose
only
inspiration
love
love
to
his
god
and
to
his
for
love
is
naught
but
god
own
nature
given
in
partial
measure
down
to
man
to
come
the
sole
delight
of
earth
the
key
to
heaven
of
all
the
virtues
centre
source
and
sum
the
old
year
the
old
year
is
dying
its
last
hour
is
hieing
over
the
verge
the
night
winds
are
plying
and
are
mournfully
sighing
its
funeral
dirge
and
now
in
its
even
while
its
spirit
is
riven
through
the
bright
zone
beyond
the
heaven
to
whence
it
was
given
to
the
unknown
its
sadness
in
ending
like
a
cloud
is
descending
over
my
soul
and
the
thoughts
that
are
pending
with
the
low
winds
are
blending
helping
their
dole
a
year
of
existence
has
passed
to
the
distance
to
return
to
the
right
was
resistance
from
duty
desistance
nor
would
i
learn
but
duty
neglected
and
virtue
rejected
we
may
amend
then
why
be
dejected
so
sorely
affected
whence
does
it
tend
is
it
that
pleasure
in
liberal
measure
i
have
not
known
ah
rapturous
pleasure
in
memory
i
treasure
but
it
is
flown
opportunity
wasted
though
far
we
have
passed
it
we
may
retrieve
but
beakers
once
tasted
of
bliss
while
they
lasted
bitterness
leave
a
summer
evening
scene
in
chateauguay
written
in
montreal
often
when
the
sun
is
sinking
the
mountain
glowing
crest
when
the
earth
and
heaven
are
linking
in
that
bond
of
peaceful
rest
then
the
weary
city
spurning
on
this
grand
repose
i
gaze
and
my
mind
in
fancy
turning
dwells
on
scenes
of
childhood
days
and
i
float
upon
the
river
at
the
selfsame
time
of
day
when
the
sparkling
waters
quiver
the
slanting
evening
ray
day
harsh
memories
forsaking
with
its
jarring
and
its
jest
for
the
soul
is
but
awaking
as
the
day
is
lulled
to
rest
glimpse
of
even
glory
getting
as
the
summer
sun
serene
in
his
softened
splendour
setting
gilds
the
spires
of
ste
martine
glimmers
through
the
silent
bushes
glances
on
the
birchen
stems
casts
perchance
his
fitful
blushes
on
the
paddle
dripping
gems
and
the
hue
of
gold
is
deeper
on
the
cornfields
by
the
stream
and
the
sickle
of
the
reaper
flashes
brightly
in
his
beam
and
the
fruits
of
late
commencing
to
indue
their
glowing
tint
richest
beauty
are
enhancing
as
they
catch
his
gentle
glint
now
he
greets
the
gaudy
dresses
of
the
lightsome
gallic
maids
rivals
through
their
raven
tresses
eyes
of
jet
beneath
their
braids
as
the
peasant
party
gathers
gaily
for
the
sportive
dance
as
of
old
have
done
their
fathers
in
the
sunny
vales
of
france
but
the
night
is
falling
thicker
and
the
twilight
soon
will
cease
so
i
paddle
on
the
quicker
past
where
beauty
reigns
with
peace
where
the
little
brooks
deliver
water
laughing
in
its
glee
or
the
murky
english
river
mingles
with
the
chateauguay
lines
written
on
a
sabbath
morning
the
snow
lies
pure
and
peaceful
on
the
ground
serenely
smiles
the
azure
sky
the
sabbath
spirit
dwells
on
all
around
and
weekly
toils
and
discords
all
are
fled
but
ah
my
soul
is
filled
with
worldly
thought
my
god
is
filled
with
thoughts
of
self
and
sin
with
seeming
care
and
trouble
it
is
fraught
and
peaceless
discontentment
reigns
within
send
down
from
heaven
the
spirit
of
thy
love
its
soothing
influence
in
my
soul
instil
uplift
my
worldly
thoughts
to
things
above
subserve
my
wishes
to
thy
better
will
reflections
on
a
tree
in
autumn
the
tree
with
its
leaves
in
luxuriance
shading
my
path
in
the
time
of
the
year
now
sighs
in
its
dirge
while
its
foliage
fading
descends
to
its
sepulchre
withered
and
sere
and
yet
i
regard
it
with
feelings
the
fonder
with
feelings
of
mingled
compassion
and
pain
as
in
pity
i
gaze
on
its
branches
and
ponder
of
once
fragrant
beauty
what
fragments
remain
for
that
barren
tree
with
adornment
so
fleeting
that
blows
in
the
autumn
wind
bleak
and
forlorn
bespeaks
the
sad
state
of
a
heart
that
is
beating
bereft
of
the
pleasures
that
once
it
has
borne
a
parting
has
the
last
farewell
been
spoken
have
i
the
parting
token
from
thy
lips
so
sweet
has
their
last
soft
word
been
spoken
till
again
we
meet
why
is
not
thy
hand
extended
is
my
maiden
queen
offended
or
does
she
forget
no
my
queen
is
not
offended
she
is
kindly
yet
for
her
eye
is
softly
beaming
and
with
tenderness
is
teeming
gentle
as
the
dove
with
a
holy
light
is
beaming
dare
i
call
it
love
but
the
time
is
fast
advancing
from
the
heaven
of
its
glancing
i
must
rend
my
heart
treacherous
time
is
fast
advancing
and
i
must
depart
ah
the
pain
the
parting
brings
me
as
a
serpent
fang
it
stings
me
leaves
me
almost
dead
ah
the
faintness
that
it
brings
me
with
the
future
fled
is
a
darkened
night
of
sorrow
waiting
for
the
light
of
morrow
thus
it
seems
to
me
is
a
night
of
pain
and
sorrow
while
i
want
for
thee
two
long
weeks
of
weary
waiting
all
my
happiness
belating
when
will
they
be
two
long
weeks
of
woful
waiting
i
see
thee
more
sonnet
to
shelley
divinely
strong
and
beautiful
in
soul
with
more
than
melody
of
mortal
voice
the
free
thy
spirit
majesty
extol
when
liberty
is
made
thy
muse
choice
and
then
how
pure
and
pleasing
is
thy
song
when
beauty
goddess
of
thy
mind
its
theme
but
most
to
thee
those
sweet
sad
strains
belong
where
truth
we
find
through
musing
fitful
dream
and
trace
uncertainty
and
how
it
gropes
through
this
and
time
to
come
with
faltering
feet
and
vanity
of
pleasure
and
the
hopes
which
fear
enfeebles
and
the
fates
defeat
strains
oft
as
if
at
thy
desire
the
wild
west
wind
had
thee
for
its
lyre
hope
oh
why
should
sorrow
wound
the
heart
and
rob
the
soul
of
rest
why
is
misfortune
bitter
dart
allowed
to
pierce
the
breast
we
dare
not
ask
is
heaven
decree
while
faring
here
below
man
bark
is
tossed
upon
the
sea
of
trouble
grief
and
woe
but
mercy
holdeth
forth
a
light
upon
the
waves
to
shine
and
cheer
him
in
the
darkest
night
the
star
of
hope
divine
enabled
thus
he
looks
before
and
sees
oh
joyful
sight
the
waves
subside
the
storm
is
the
sky
is
clear
and
bright
what
comfort
is
when
cares
annoy
to
know
they
are
from
one
whose
hand
dispenses
peace
and
joy
as
well
as
grief
and
pain
then
cherish
hope
despondent
heart
with
strength
renew
the
fight
and
god
will
gladness
yet
impart
thy
darkness
turn
to
light
the
dreary
winter
soon
is
done
and
then
the
month
of
may
the
clouds
which
now
obscure
the
sun
will
soon
have
passed
away
sonnet
to
macvicar
stay
of
the
church
and
pillar
of
the
state
who
alway
to
wrong
thy
voice
oppose
and
strong
hast
striven
corruption
to
expose
and
jealous
ever
for
thy
country
fate
her
virtues
to
preserve
inviolate
much
to
thy
power
the
platform
pulpit
owes
thy
pen
has
held
the
right
and
quelled
her
foes
a
man
withal
thou
art
and
truly
great
and
true
to
thy
convictions
firm
thou
hast
in
these
last
troublous
times
maintained
thy
stand
and
boldly
at
thy
post
hast
faced
the
blast
that
threatens
still
the
ship
of
state
to
strand
and
shown
thy
resolution
to
the
last
to
serve
thy
god
thy
sovereign
and
thy
land
ah
happy
was
i
yesternight
ah
happy
was
i
yesternight
i
trod
the
paths
of
love
within
elysian
fields
of
bliss
enchanted
bowers
above
a
heavenly
maiden
by
my
side
so
wondrous
fair
that
surrounding
nature
shared
her
charms
imparted
to
the
scene
by
smiling
we
strolled
and
joyous
woods
among
whose
every
grove
tune
from
birds
that
gaily
sung
we
breathed
the
breath
of
fragrant
flowers
that
filled
the
scented
air
the
gentle
zephyr
fanned
our
cheeks
and
waved
her
silken
hair
we
glided
on
through
glassy
glades
where
in
the
golden
glow
fantastic
forms
by
fancy
framed
were
flitting
to
and
fro
she
seeming
spake
but
was
not
speech
the
words
were
notes
of
love
soft
silver
sounds
as
though
they
fell
strains
from
the
harps
above
the
passing
rapture
of
the
hour
is
folly
to
recall
all
all
around
was
paradise
and
she
was
queen
of
all
we
parted
broken
was
the
spell
the
blissful
dream
was
i
stood
upon
the
city
street
before
her
father
door
what
though
i
wildly
walked
the
hills
nor
any
respite
found
my
thoughts
as
ghastly
and
as
dark
as
were
the
shades
around
what
though
since
then
in
stygian
gloom
my
soul
to
grope
is
given
can
earth
be
else
but
dull
to
him
who
once
has
tasted
heaven
sonnet
to
asterie
i
was
enveloped
in
black
clouds
of
woe
woven
my
vision
by
despair
i
breathed
the
poison
of
the
midnight
air
and
its
dank
oppression
wasted
low
i
staggered
wildly
in
the
gloom
at
first
and
prayed
in
anguish
that
it
be
removed
then
cursed
the
day
i
saw
thee
saw
and
loved
and
ceased
to
hope
the
clouds
would
be
dispersed
at
last
that
heavenly
love
that
rules
the
night
removed
thine
orbit
nearer
to
the
earth
and
filled
my
soul
with
rapturous
delight
and
in
the
place
of
that
devouring
dearth
when
i
can
see
though
distant
still
thy
light
blest
happiness
from
hope
receives
her
birth
vain
transient
world
vain
transient
world
what
charms
are
thine
and
what
do
mortals
in
thee
see
that
they
should
worship
at
thy
shrine
and
sacrifice
their
all
to
thee
thy
brightest
gifts
thy
happiest
hours
fly
past
on
pinions
of
the
wind
they
fade
like
blooms
upon
the
flowers
and
leave
a
painful
want
behind
thou
art
a
road
though
not
of
space
which
rich
and
poor
alike
must
tread
thy
starting
point
we
can
not
trace
thine
end
the
country
of
the
dead
a
pathway
paved
with
want
and
woe
with
pleasures
painful
incomplete
like
stones
upon
the
way
below
which
wound
the
weary
pilgrim
feet
hedged
with
visions
of
despair
with
words
of
hate
with
looks
of
scorn
like
wayside
thorns
which
pierce
and
tear
the
fainting
traveller
weak
and
worn
relentless
odium
bitter
ill
cold
disregard
thy
ways
infest
like
wintry
blasts
that
chill
and
kill
the
very
heart
within
the
breast
fragment
of
a
hymn
god
of
mercy
without
measure
god
of
love
in
thy
gracious
pleasure
countless
blessings
from
above
bounteous
benefits
bestowing
in
a
kind
continuous
course
favour
from
thee
ever
flowing
as
a
stream
from
ocean
source
grateful
praise
my
aspiration
pardon
my
presumptuous
pen
and
accept
my
poor
oblation
and
forgive
its
feeble
strain
thou
to
whom
such
praise
is
given
too
divine
for
mortal
ears
in
the
angel
choirs
of
heaven
and
the
music
of
the
spheres
prayer
for
submission
how
often
lord
when
is
thy
will
to
use
the
chastening
rod
my
soul
possessed
of
passions
ill
rebels
against
its
god
denies
that
justice
reigns
in
heaven
doth
his
decrees
pervade
and
loathes
the
blessings
he
hath
given
the
creatures
he
hath
made
do
thou
the
spirit
me
instil
of
sweet
submission
lord
and
teach
me
to
thy
sovereign
will
in
meekness
to
accord
like
him
who
felt
affliction
fire
but
never
did
repine
and
bore
the
cross
at
thy
desire
when
harder
far
than
mine
enough
it
is
my
king
command
what
more
do
i
require
yet
what
is
from
a
father
hand
can
but
to
good
conspire
and
all
thy
workings
are
inwove
in
thine
eternal
plan
which
wills
the
welfare
in
thy
love
and
works
the
weal
of
man
sonnet
to
journeying
through
a
desert
waste
and
drear
exhausted
and
disheartened
by
his
way
so
hard
and
parched
unchanged
from
day
to
day
saw
the
lone
traveller
an
oasis
near
in
which
a
tender
flower
did
appear
endued
with
beauty
and
with
fragrance
sweet
known
not
to
scorching
winds
nor
blighting
heat
and
gazing
on
it
it
imparted
cheer
the
traveller
trod
the
weary
sands
of
time
entering
thy
home
delightful
peace
he
found
radiant
with
youthful
beauty
half
divine
on
him
thine
angel
face
with
sunbeams
crowned
smiled
and
that
artless
beaming
smile
of
thine
sped
to
his
soul
that
with
new
life
did
bound
the
song
of
the
summer
cloud
i
am
arrayed
in
light
and
shade
a
spirit
of
air
a
fanciful
theme
like
a
twilight
dream
or
a
maiden
young
and
fair
and
now
i
float
like
a
phantom
boat
with
a
vague
and
varying
hue
fading
from
sight
in
the
beams
of
light
on
an
ocean
clear
and
blue
and
now
i
am
wooed
by
the
wind
so
rude
as
he
rushes
in
fury
past
who
his
bride
doth
crown
with
a
darkening
frown
as
i
ride
in
the
car
of
the
blast
and
down
i
pour
the
thunder
roar
while
the
lightnings
gleam
and
glare
till
the
floods
resound
as
they
burst
their
bound
and
laugh
at
what
man
can
dare
and
now
he
is
flown
and
has
left
me
alone
to
brood
in
bereavement
and
woe
and
i
hang
like
a
pall
while
the
fall
like
steady
and
slow
but
again
he
returns
when
my
gloom
he
discerns
and
subdues
his
dark
spirit
of
storms
and
the
shower
descends
while
the
rainbow
blends
and
the
sunshine
brightens
and
warms
montreal
written
in
winter
all
clad
in
rich
hiemal
robes
by
blasts
of
boreas
plied
the
sovereign
city
of
the
north
sits
in
majestic
pride
beside
lawrence
noble
stream
hard
by
his
hidden
tide
she
sits
and
rears
her
head
aloft
upon
mount
royal
side
a
crown
she
wears
of
richest
gems
of
purest
crystal
bright
that
sparkle
like
a
maiden
eyes
which
dazzle
with
delight
not
gems
that
glitter
best
beneath
the
courtly
lamps
by
night
but
those
whose
brilliancy
appears
by
morning
purer
light
her
sceptre
is
not
mineral
from
the
dust
nor
gold
nor
silver
long
profaned
by
man
accursèd
lust
nor
substance
base
enough
to
feel
the
vitiating
rust
but
is
a
crystalled
branch
of
oak
just
riven
by
the
gust
i
sit
a
queen
she
proudly
says
from
the
atlantic
main
to
where
the
rockies
to
the
sky
their
shaggy
summits
strain
from
where
lawrence
speeds
along
the
ocean
wave
to
gain
to
where
in
darkness
sleeps
the
heaven
unwaked
by
phoebus
wain
the
fever
burns
from
morn
till
eve
the
following
is
an
attempt
to
render
in
verse
the
passionate
words
of
a
young
officer
in
the
indian
service
who
had
fallen
a
prey
to
the
ravages
of
the
fever
the
fever
burns
from
morn
till
eve
i
toss
upon
my
bed
and
none
but
heavy
hands
relieve
my
aching
heated
head
harsh
voices
of
men
attempt
to
sympathize
but
sympathy
is
worthless
when
love
gives
it
not
its
rise
could
thy
soft
hand
but
soothe
my
brain
thy
voice
to
mine
reply
rapture
then
to
toss
in
pain
rapture
to
die
oh
the
sickening
sensation
oh
the
sickening
sensation
oh
the
burning
agitation
in
my
soul
oh
the
awful
desolation
of
my
soul
and
my
breast
is
sore
with
sighing
comfort
to
myself
denying
comfort
and
relief
denying
to
my
soul
distrest
and
sore
while
that
worst
of
all
diseases
with
a
pain
that
naught
appeases
ever
burns
while
a
pain
that
grimly
pleases
alway
burns
kindled
by
thy
bright
eye
beaming
by
thy
brilliant
blue
eye
beaming
when
i
saw
thee
saw
and
loved
thee
on
that
fatal
eve
of
yore
and
anon
it
has
been
living
and
a
blissful
sadness
giving
while
with
thee
mingled
bliss
and
sadness
giving
while
with
thee
but
ah
now
its
woful
waging
laying
waste
with
cruel
raging
this
my
heart
as
with
a
vulture
gnawing
at
its
very
core
would
kind
angels
waft
me
to
thee
waft
me
for
one
moment
to
thee
let
me
gaze
one
moment
on
thee
but
one
blissful
moment
on
thee
satisfy
this
languid
longing
for
the
one
whom
i
adore
oh
to
quench
this
lethal
longing
for
the
one
whom
i
adore
the
noble
woman
a
woman
on
an
empire
throne
has
sat
in
queenly
pride
and
swayed
the
sceptre
of
her
power
land
and
ocean
wide
a
crown
of
gold
adorned
the
head
that
held
a
nation
fate
and
courtly
knights
and
princely
peers
did
on
her
bidding
wait
a
woman
too
in
ancient
days
has
borne
the
warrior
brand
and
by
heroic
deed
performed
has
saved
her
native
land
she
too
has
sung
inspiring
songs
and
told
entrancing
tales
has
softened
and
has
swayed
the
mind
where
bolder
genius
fails
but
nobler
far
than
thronèd
queen
or
heroine
of
fame
or
she
who
by
her
potent
pen
has
won
illustrious
name
is
she
who
seeks
the
needy
out
nor
scorns
the
wretched
door
but
with
compassion
christlike
loves
to
help
the
humble
poor
to
a
star
dreary
and
dismal
and
dark
is
the
night
of
life
to
me
with
nothing
but
clouds
in
the
heaven
above
cruelly
hiding
the
star
that
i
love
whose
radiance
was
rapture
to
see
while
the
blasts
from
the
cold
frozen
north
are
biting
right
in
to
my
soul
while
the
pitiless
blasts
from
the
bleak
barren
shore
of
the
crystalline
ocean
incessantly
roar
and
the
tempests
that
sweep
from
the
pole
oh
the
gloom
of
the
dark
dreary
night
concealing
the
star
that
i
love
oh
how
bitter
the
anguish
bereft
of
its
beam
while
the
beings
around
me
are
such
that
i
seem
in
a
dungeon
of
demons
to
move
oh
when
will
the
clouds
clear
away
and
brighten
the
heaven
above
oh
when
to
the
realm
of
the
sky
in
a
golden
car
of
thy
beams
shall
i
fly
to
live
with
the
star
that
i
love
veni
vidi
victus
sum
to
hither
led
by
fancy
hand
once
again
i
seem
to
stand
in
that
hall
in
which
this
eye
blind
before
to
beauty
ray
lighted
up
in
ecstasy
instantly
it
gazed
on
thee
here
too
was
it
where
this
heart
previous
proof
to
cupid
dart
in
thy
presence
trembled
fell
fearful
fluttered
thy
spell
all
so
sudden
so
complete
chronicled
in
words
meet
such
as
cæsar
famous
three
which
will
well
apply
to
me
if
the
classic
clause
become
veni
vidi
victus
sum
to
my
couch
when
the
toils
of
the
day
are
done
when
its
trials
and
cares
are
when
the
forces
of
mind
and
body
are
run
and
the
heart
is
sore
how
welcome
to
me
is
thy
rest
the
breath
of
approaching
peace
which
soothes
the
soul
with
a
prospect
blest
of
sweet
release
may
my
life
be
such
that
so
at
its
even
this
comfort
i
have
for
sleep
is
the
symbol
of
death
and
thou
art
the
sign
of
the
grave
separation
parted
cruelly
from
thee
what
oh
what
is
life
to
me
is
the
morn
without
the
lark
it
is
wine
without
its
spark
christmas
time
without
its
glee
music
without
harmony
new
year
eve
devoid
of
mirth
winter
night
without
the
hearth
is
a
day
without
the
light
is
a
moonless
starless
night
barren
of
its
leaf
weeping
without
its
relief
is
a
fire
but
unconsuming
poisonous
plant
but
never
blooming
ship
becalmed
without
its
peace
death
without
its
sweet
release
treasured
memories
the
playful
way
thy
wanton
hair
was
tossing
in
the
wind
thy
girlish
vain
vexation
is
treasured
in
my
mind
held
in
my
heart
each
sacred
spot
which
we
roamed
at
will
the
rose
that
bloomed
upon
thy
breast
blooms
in
my
memory
still
still
do
i
see
thy
sunny
smile
in
sportive
dimples
traced
like
truant
beams
of
morning
light
by
flitting
fairies
chased
thy
merry
maiden
laughter
still
is
ringing
in
my
ear
as
silver
streams
in
sylvan
shades
make
music
sweet
to
hear
to
fair
one
embodiment
of
loveliness
angelic
beauty
beams
upon
thy
countenance
and
from
its
image
of
lucretian
purity
thine
inborn
virtue
shines
divinely
forth
thy
sparkling
eyes
of
bright
cerulean
blue
rich
sapphire
gems
flash
with
arcadian
artlessness
impelling
cupid
arrows
discharged
from
bow
of
myrtle
my
heart
which
throbs
and
flutters
quivering
from
the
thrust
to
an
umbrella
thou
art
the
belonging
blest
of
the
maid
i
love
the
best
gardened
in
some
tropic
grove
nurtured
by
the
powers
above
was
thy
wood
so
rich
and
rare
for
her
hand
so
small
and
fair
deftly
carved
by
cunning
craft
for
her
hold
thy
finished
haft
and
thy
silken
folds
so
soft
where
the
gentle
breezes
waft
fragrance
from
the
clustered
vines
where
the
sun
so
warmly
shines
where
the
skies
of
purest
hue
bend
above
in
deepest
blue
there
so
soft
and
fine
were
wove
woven
only
for
my
love
but
it
is
not
that
thy
haft
carved
is
by
cunning
craft
of
a
wood
so
rich
and
rare
that
thy
folds
are
soft
and
fair
vying
only
with
her
hair
not
for
this
that
i
addrest
thee
in
song
and
called
thee
blest
but
what
thou
for
her
hast
done
shaded
from
the
scorching
sun
on
the
burning
summer
day
thy
silken
canopy
sheltered
from
the
falling
rain
lest
her
hallowed
cheek
it
stain
shielded
from
the
stormy
blast
as
it
hurried
wildly
past
surely
thou
art
blest
for
oh
that
i
might
do
as
much
the
fair
orb
to
the
fair
orb
on
which
i
gaze
suggests
thy
radiance
by
its
rays
that
silvery
soft
and
dreamy
light
so
soft
and
yet
so
beauteous
bright
falling
in
glowing
tints
so
faint
the
hues
which
artists
love
to
paint
around
whose
sphere
the
fancies
claim
that
angels
float
and
fan
the
flame
the

choice
it
doth
belong
to

and

that
light
though
native
to
the
skies
is
all
reflected
in
thine
eyes
to
burns
suggested
on
returning
home
for
my
holidays
by
an
old
portrait
of
the
poet
which
hangs
in
my
room
old
friend
i
always
loved
thee
in
childhood
early
days
delighted
i
would
listen
with
laughter
to
thy
lays
and
better
still
i
loved
thee
to
riper
boyhood
grown
because
thou
wert
the
pride
of
the
land
that
part
my
own
but
with
devotion
deepened
i
greet
thee
now
anew
of
love
because
thou
singest
so
simple
sweet
and
true
could
i
but
mention
but
thy
name
could
i
but
strike
a
sweeter
note
than
all
from
virgin
choirs
that
float
or
harps
with
cords
of
gold
a
note
more
soft
and
more
sublime
than
she
the
sweetest
of
the
nine
euterpe
strains
unfold
the
note
which
even
now
i
hear
for
angels
breathe
it
in
my
ear
but
never
dared
to
raise
could
i
but
mention
but
thy
name
to
whom
i
owe
this
sacred
flame
and
love
inspired
lays
ah
then
methinks
when
i
should
hear
my
muse
employ
that
word
so
dear
when
thoughts
of
thee
inspire
in
sweeter
strains
my
song
should
swell
than
from
harp
of
orpheus
fell
or
phoebus
lyre
lines
written
in
an
album
with
beauty
and
grace
that
greet
the
eye
how
pleasing
is
to
trace
within
the
beauty
of
holiness
that
higher
heavenly
grace
scene
in
the
trojan
war
translated
from
homer
and
when
ranks
in
conflict
closed
shield
rang
on
shield
and
rattled
lance
on
lance
and
clashed
the
might
of
brazen
mailèd
men
and
the
din
of
steel
steel
the
exultation
and
the
groans
arose
of
warriors
slaying
warriors
being
slain
and
soon
the
earth
flowed
red
with
heroes
blood
and
such
the
raging
of
the
mingled
host
as
wintry
torrents
bursting
from
the
hills
hurl
in
one
basin
their
impetuous
flood
from
mighty
springs
within
the
hollow
rock
and
the
lone
shepherd
hears
the
distant
roar
montreal
in
by
thee
fair
city
is
mount
royal
based
which
though
its
inward
fires
are
extinct
seems
in
the
flush
of
morning
indistinct
when
misty
shadows
are
across
it
chased
over
its
flaky
bosom
pure
and
white
which
glows
and
glistens
in
the
early
light
seems
moved
with
passion
it
thou
art

in
winter
jewelled
brilliancy
arrayed
with
sparkling
spire
and
glassy
dome
displayed
a
girdle
on

maiden
waist
our
father
father
how
precious
is
that
name
to
me
name
rendered
sacred
by
earthly
ties
how
full
of
vaster
meaning
when
applied
to
him
in
the
heavenly
home
how
much
of
love
it
whispers
to
the
soul
of
that
true
pure
and
unimpassioned
love
that
lasting
love
which
father
bears
to
son
it
speaks
of
kindly
interest
fond
regard
and
anxious
care
the
offspring
of
that
love
its
sound
assures
of
guidance
in
the
right
of
readiness
to
guard
from
what
is
ill
of
willingness
to
grant
supporting
aid
of
gracious
blessings
and
of
bounteous
gifts
and
then
unlike
a
father
here
below
the
heavenly
father
favour
and
his

are
unrestricted
in
their
exercise
his

unbounded

infinite

while

soon
must
go

ever
lives
and
ever
is
the

sometimes
my
heart
by
cruel
care
opprest
to
sometimes
my
heart
by
cruel
care
opprest
faints
from
the
weight
of
woe
upon
my
breast
my
soul
embittered
far
beyond
belief
as
damned
one
drinking
galling
draughts
of
grief
which
boils
and
burns
within
without
relief
while
fervid
flames
inflict
the
wounds
unhealed
with
hellish
horrors
not
to
man
revealed
when
peace
and
joy
seem
wrapt
in
sable
shrouds
and
young
hope
heaven
is
black
with
lowering
clouds
is
then
thy
vision
comes
before
my
view
is
then
i
see
those
beaming
eyes
of
blue
and
hear
thy
gentle
voice
in
accents
kind
and
see
thy
cheerful
smile
before
my
mind
and
taking
heart
i
battle
on
anew
and
thank
my
god
for
sending
to
my
soul
his
own
blest
soothing
balm
of
peace
again
who
sometimes
still
as
in
the
days
of
old
by
angels
sends
his
blessings
down
to
men

prayer
of
the
penitent
profligate

worthless
better
fit
to

daily
with

have
mourned
could
they
have
pierced
the

and
peering
into

years
have
read
thy

so
sadly

now
now
mercenary
lust
hath
the
place
of

and
that

gone

what
wonder
then
that
to
my

the
tear
will
sometimes
start
what
wonder
that
the
clouds
of
grief
hang
heavy
my
heart
the
orphan
maid
of
glencoe
note
the
tale
is
told
a
few
years
after
the
massacre
of
glencoe
by
a
wandering
bard
who
had
formerly
been
piper
to
macdonald
of
glencoe
but
had
escaped
the
fate
of
his
kinsmen
i
tell
a
tale
of
woful
tragedy
resulting
from
that
fearful
infamy
that
unsurpassed
unrivalled
treachery
that
merciless
that
beastlike
butchery
upon
the
evening
calm
and
bright
that
followed
on
the
fatal
night
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
red
behind
benmore
sequestered
head
and
weeping
tears
of
yellow
light
that
streaming
down
bedimmed
his
sight
as
he
prepared
to
make
his
grave
beneath
the
deep
atlantic
wave
i
stood
and
viewed
with
starting
tears
the
silent
scene
of
glorious
years
and
thought
me
on
my
former
pride
as
when
i
marched
my
chief
beside
before
my
clansmen
strong
and
bold
returning
to
our
mountain
hold
victorious
in
the
bloody
close
and
weighed
with
spoils
of
vanquished
foes
and
filled
the
rocky
glens
around
with
peals
of
wild
triumphant
sound
but
when
i
saw
the
bloody
stains
and
gazed
upon
the
black
remains
and
thought
upon
my
murdered
chief
for
rage
i
quick
forgot
my
grief
and
deeply
vowed
of
vengeance
then
upon
the
cursed
campbell
men
but
then
alas
how
vain
my
vow
where
were
lochaber
warriors
now
when
thus
to
bitter
grief
returned
adown
the
valley
i
discerned
a
figure
and
my
fading
eye
a
female
form
could
just
descry
who
onward
came
in
fleet
career
swiftly
as
speed
the
frighted
deer
her
gait
and
garb
so
light
and
wild
bespoke
the
maid
the
mountain
child
her
auburn
tresses
waved
behind
bespread
luxuriant
on
the
wind
and
from
her
soft
and
deep
blue
eye
in
colour
like
the
midnight
sky
there
beamed
a
clear
and
beauteous
light
as
from
the
blue
of
northern
night
and
to
my
side
young
janet
ran
the
pride
and
flower
of
the
clan
with
direful
thoughts
and
faces
dazed
we
one
upon
the
other
gazed
nothing
she
spake
but
turning
in
silence
sought
the
cumbered
ground
a
bitter
cry
the
maiden
gave
as
she
approached
the
open
grave
and
as
among
its
ways
she
went
she
wailed
this
mournful
wild
lament
where
where
is
the
beauty
that
once
i
could
scan
and
where
is
the
power
and
pride
of
my
clan
ah
gloomy
is
the
vale
of
glencoe
and
the
house
of
ian
abrach
is
humbled
and
low
the
bright
spot
of
my
childhood
is
reft
of
its
light
dark
dark
are
the
scenes
it
presents
to
my
sight
and
the
homes
of
its
people
have
shared
in
its
fate
and
its
children
are
murdered
through
malice
and
hate
yes
the
warm
highland
heart
that
had
prompted
the
host
with
the
other
to
vie
in
regaling
them
most
by
the
hand
of
the
stranger
the
wolf
in
the
fold
when
the
feasting
is
over
lies
lifeless
and
cold
and
the
youth
that
had
cheerfully
led
in
the
chase
whose
mind
never
dreamed
of
dishonour
so
base
and
who
weary
that
night
had
retired
to
rest
awoke
with
the
treacherous
steel
in
his
breast
and
the
damsel
bewildered
with
witcheries
wove
elated
with
flattery
fêted
with
love
in
the
height
of
her
maidenly
beauty
and
joy
having
lain
down
to
dream
was
awakened
to
die
and
not
even
the
babe
that
reposed
on
the
breast
in
its
innocent
peace
was
permitted
to
rest
prophetic
and
awful
the
curses
of
guilt
are
the
cryings
of
children
whose
blood
has
been
spilt
and
there
lies
the
chieftain
beloved
and
revered
his
rule
it
was
just
nor
in
conflict
he
feared
he
was
butchered
at
night
by
the
villainous
foe
and
discoloured
with
blood
in
his
couch
in
the
snow
my
father
my
father
why
here
dost
thou
lie
arouse
thee
dear
father
arouse
thee
is
i
why
dost
thou
not
answer
my
god
it
is
so
and
his
lips
are
as
cold
and
as
white
as
the
snow
thou
wilt
lead
not
again
in
the
field
or
the
chase
nor
clasp
thy
dear
janet
in
loving
embrace
ah
dreary
and
barren
life
desert
to
me
kind
heavenly
father
o
take
me
to
thee
and
o
heaven
for
strength
and
my
mother
thy
hand
too
is
cold
and
discoloured
with
death
pallid
brand
and
thine
eye
which
had
beamed
with
thy
love
as
thou
smiled
is
fixed
on
the
welkin
both
wanly
and
wild
and
hushed
are
the
tones
of
that
motherly
voice
in
whose
kind
commendation
i
used
to
rejoice
alas
i
am
lonely
without
thee
to
cheer
do
thou
gentle
mother
of
jesus
be
near
i
am
fatherless
motherless
ronald
my
god
thy
sepulchre
too
is
the
sod
my
ronald
my
hero
the
king
of
my
heart
o
christ
thou
hast
power
do
thou
life
the
sisters
of
old
were
made
glad
at
thy
will
but
my
lover
lies
breathless
and
motionless
still
can
naught
else
restore
warmth
to
the
frame
of
the
dead
not
my
passion
embrace
nor
the
hot
tears
i
shed
but
alas
my
narcissus
is
lifeless
at
length
for
ever
laid
low
his
herculean
strength
and
that
manly
bosom
that
throbbed
with
the
sway
of
a
heart
true
and
noble
is
silent
for
aye
yet
he
looks
like
a
prince
as
he
lies
in
repose
on
his
tomb
and
with
snows
the
snow
too
is
thy
shroud
and
thy
funeral
chant
is
the
wail
of
a
maiden
lamenting
thy
want
o
ronald
so
generous
noble
and
true
how
unworthy
thy
loved
one
how
deeply
i
rue
my
pride
my
caprice
and
the
preference
shown
but
now
thou
art
dead
and
the
damned
one
is
flown
how
deeply
he
loved
and
how
zealously
wooed
my
god
is
beside
where
our
cottage
late
stood
he
could
have
escaped
but
alone
would
not
fly
and
aha
for
my
safety
for
me
did
he
die
aha
aha
the
maiden
cried
aha
aha
the
rocks
replied
was
carried
weird
upon
the
wind
and
wildly
woke
the
hills
behind
it
smote
the
birds
upon
the
wing
they
fled
afar
and
ceased
to
sing
it
pierced
my
heart
that
still
its
blight
it
bears
upon
it
day
and
night
still
when
the
eventime
is
nigh
i
hear
the
maiden
withering
cry
and
see
her
spectral
shadow
by
which
stays
and
haunts
my
restless
dreams
disturbed
by
those
screams
aha
she
cried
and
down
the
glen
she
madly
took
her
way
again
through
shadowy
vale
shaggy
hill
young
janet
wanders
frantic
still
watched
and
sustained
from
year
to
year
by
pity
of
the
mountaineer
who
knows
the
story
of
her
woe
and
curses
deep
her
kindred
foe
and
on
from
year
to
year
the
same
she
wildly
calls
on
ronald
name
a
parody
once
upon
a
midnight
dreary
as
i
sauntered
weak
and
weary
from
a
jovial
room
upon
another
floor
as
i
sauntered
sadder
sicker
suddenly
i
heard
a
snicker
and
the
lights
began
to
flicker
and
right
out
went
three
or
four
some
infernal
trick
i
muttered
as
i
neared
my
chamber
door
i
wo
stand
this
any
more
ah
distinctly
i
remember
it
was
in
my
first
september
and
each
member
fled
like
ghost
upon
the
floor
lamp
i
vainly
sought
to
borrow
though
i
threatened
on
the
morrow
they
would
catch
it
to
their
sorrow
they
would
catch
it
sad
and
sore
i
would
have
them
on
the
morrow
the
dread
faculty
before
fearful
here
for
evermore
and
the
hushed
and
humorous
talking
and
the
doors
successive
locking
filled
me
thrilled
me
with
fantastic
terrors
often
felt
before
so
that
now
to
still
the
beating
of
my
heart
i
stood
repeating
is
some
prank
they
are
repeating
that
they
played
the
night
before
sewn
perchance
my
couch
covering
firmly
fixed
my
chamber
door
effigy
upon
my
floor
then
toward
my
chamber
turning
for
my
wonted
slumber
yearning
straightway
i
could
hear
them
laughing
somewhat
louder
than
before
surely
said
i
surely
that
is
ominous
foreboding
that
is
let
me
see
then
what
the
rat
is
and
this
mystery
explore
i
discover
what
the
rat
is
and
this
mystery
explore
for
methinks
is
something
more
open
then
i
flung
the
portal
and
oh
miserable
mortal
down
there
fell
a
pan
of
water
in
a
most
tremendous
pour
not
the
least
cessation
made
it
not
a
second
stopped
or
stayed
it
but
before
i
could
evade
it
down
it
fell
from
off
the
door
fell
and
with
its
icy
current
chilled
me
to
the
very
core
this
there
was
what
could
be
more
deep
into
the
darkness
staring
long
i
stood
there
thundering
tearing
shouting
threatening
threats
no
mortal
ever
dared
to
threat
before
and
my
face
was
wild
and
ashen
and
to
aggravate
my
passion
each
in
an
insulting
fashion
thrust
his
head
from
out
his
door
and
the
worst
of
all
the
wretches
met
me
with
a
mocking
roar
asking
had
i
got
to
shore
instantly
my
speech
grew
stronger
i
could
stand
it
now
no
longer
cur
said
i
or
madman
my
forgiveness
now
implore
for
my
patience
now
is
sapping
and
the
truth
is
this
is
capping
what
too
often
has
been
happing
what
in
future
shall
be
now
most
humbly
my
forgiveness
i
demand
that
you
implore
but
he
answered
nevermore
and
the
wretches
unremitting
still
are
sitting
still
are
sitting
sitting
each
successive
session
on
the
freshmen
as
of
yore
who
with
burning
indignation
and
with
angry
imprecation
undergo
initiation
to
this
school
of
modern
lore
and
the
rackets
now
resounding
through
this
school
of
life
and
lore
shall
be
silenced
nevermore
tomakewaw
a
parody
give
me
of
your
fruit
banana
of
your
yellow
fruit
banana
growing
on
the
tropic
islands
fertile
islands
in
the
ocean
i
a
little
trick
will
play
me
play
it
on
the
darkened
staircase
where
no
light
has
late
been
burning
where
the
students
walk
in
darkness
walk
on
foot
perchance
on
lay
aside
your
fruit
banana
quickly
lay
your
fruit
aside
you
for
the
eventime
is
coming
when
the
stairs
are
wrapt
in
darkness
and
i
yet
to
waft
me
distant
many
leagues
land
and
ocean
to
a
famous
school
of
learning
in
the
land
of
the
pale
faces
in
the
city
of
the
mountain
thus
aloud
cried
tomakewaw
chief
of
all
the
imps
of
darkness
on
an
island
in
the
ocean
in
the
wide
pacific
ocean
and
the
tall
tree
shook
its
branches
shook
with
mirth
its
ladened
branches
saying
with
a
burst
of
laughter
take
my
fruit
o
tomakewaw
then
its
fruit
he
picked
with
gladness
gathered
it
with
exultation
sped
across
the
wide
pacific
over
mountain
over
prairie
to
the
shores
of
the
great
river
to
the
banks
of
the
lawrence
to
the
city
of
the
mountain
here
within
the
school
of
learning
sought
he
out
a
student
chamber
where
he
peeled
the
fruit
delicious
cleft
the
yellow
rind
asunder
ate
the
fruit
but
saved
the
peeling
and
he
then
with
quiet
movements
took
up
the
banana
peeling
issued
out
into
the
darkness
noiseless
glided
through
the
passage
till
he
reached
the
darkened
staircase
where
upon
the
topmost
step
he
placed
with
care
the
oily
peeling
placed
the
smooth
banana
peeling
later
on
we
have
the
sailing
the
principal
in
a
notable
college
the
story
is
told
bear
repetition
although
somewhat
old
that
at
some
unauthenticate
date
in
the
past
i
think
was
the
month
or
the
year
before
last
the
principal
brought
a
complaint
the
steward
concerning
a
matter
he
long
had
endured
he
deposed
that
the
former
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
had
neglected
to
see
to
his
and
requested
the
faculty
grave
and
sedate
to
sit
and
consider
the
point
in
debate
which
this
reverend
body
would
straightway
have
done
had
not
a
professor
objection
begun
by
insisting
that
such
an
undignified
act
to
the
faculty
was
not
becoming
in
fact
that
he
for
his
part
refused
to
comply
with
the
purpose
the
principal
wished
to
apply
considering
it
both
his
place
and
apparel
to
sit
upon
anyone
