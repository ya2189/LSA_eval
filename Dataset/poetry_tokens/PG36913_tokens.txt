their
choral
song
the
child

in
his
heart
grows
burning
mad
for
the
night
and
the

itself

note
the
divine
vision
this
mood
hath
known
all
beauty
for
it
sees
majesties
in
these
pale
forms
and
kingly
crowns
of
gold
on
brows
no
longer
bold
and
through
the
shadowy
terrors
of
their
hell
the
love
for
which
they
fell
and
how
desire
which
cast
them
in
the
deep
called
god
too
from
his
sleep
oh
pity
only
seer
who
looking
through
a
heart
melted
like
dew
seest
the
long
perished
in
the
present
thus
for
ever
dwell
in
us
whatever
time
thy
golden
eyelids
ope
they
travel
to
a
hope
not
only
backward
from
these
low
degrees
to
starry
dynasties
but
looking
far
where
now
the
silence
owns
and
rules
from
empty
thrones
thou
seest
the
enchanted
hills
of
heaven
burn
for
joy
at
our
return
thy
tender
kiss
hath
memory
we
are
kings
for
all
our
wanderings
thy
shining
eyes
already
see
the
after
in
hidden
light
and
laughter
the
gates
of
dreamland
it
a
lonely
road
through
bogland
to
the
lake
at
carrowmore
and
a
sleeper
there
lies
dreaming
where
the
water
laps
the
shore
though
the
of
the
twilight
in
their
purples
are
unfurled
yet
his
sleep
is
filled
with
music
by
the
masters
of
the
world
there
a
hand
is
white
as
silver
that
is
fondling
with
his
hair
there
are
glimmering
feet
of
sunshine
that
are
dancing
by
him
there
and
lips
of
faery
that
were
dyed
a
faery
red
in
their
revels
where
the
hazel
tree
its
holy
clusters
shed
come
away
the
red
lips
whisper
all
the
world
is
weary
now
is
the
twilight
of
the
ages
and
it
time
to
quit
the
plough
oh
the
very
sunlight
weary
ere
it
lightens
up
the
dew
and
its
gold
is
changed
and
faded
before
it
falls
to
you
though
your
colleen
heart
be
tender
a
tenderer
heart
is
near
what
the
starlight
in
her
glances
when
the
stars
are
shining
clear
who
would
kiss
the
fading
shadow
when
the
glows
above
is
the
beauty
of
all
beauty
that
is
calling
for
your
love
oh
the
great
gates
of
the
mountain
have
opened
once
again
and
the
sound
of
song
and
dancing
falls
upon
the
ears
of
men
and
the
land
of
youth
lies
gleaming
flushed
with
rainbow
light
and
mirth
and
the
old
enchantment
lingers
in
the
of
earth
freedom
i
will
not
follow
you
my
bird
i
will
not
follow
you
i
would
not
breathe
a
word
my
bird
to
bring
thee
here
anew
i
love
the
free
in
thee
my
bird
the
lure
of
freedom
drew
the
light
you
fly
toward
my
bird
i
fly
with
thee
unto
and
there
we
yet
will
meet
my
bird
though
far
i
go
from
you
where
in
the
light
outpoured
my
bird
are
love
and
freedom
too
the
master
singer
a
laughter
in
the
diamond
air
a
music
in
the
trembling
grass
and
one
by
one
the
words
of
light
as
joydrops
through
my
being
pass
i
am
the
sunlight
in
the
heart
the
silver
in
the
mind
my
laughter
runs
and
ripples
through
the
wavy
tresses
of
the
wind
i
am
the
fire
upon
the
hills
the
dancing
flame
that
leads
afar
each
burning
hearted
wanderer
and
i
the
dear
and
homeward
star
a
myriad
lovers
died
for
me
and
in
their
latest
yielded
breath
i
woke
in
glory
giving
them
immortal
life
though
touched
by
death
they
knew
me
from
the
dawn
of
time
if
hermes
beats
his
rainbow
wings
if
angus
shakes
his
locks
of
light
or
apollo
sings
it
matters
not
the
name
the
land
my
joy
in
all
the
gods
abides
even
in
the
cricket
in
the
grass
some
dimness
of
me
smiles
and
hides
for
joy
of
me
the
daystar
glows
and
in
delight
and
wild
desire
the
peacock
twilight
rays
aloft
its
plumes
and
blooms
of
shadowy
fire
where
in
the
vastness
too
i
burn
through
summer
nights
and
ages
long
and
with
the
watchers
shake
in
myriad
dance
and
song
remembrance
there
were
many
burning
hours
on
the
tide
and
we
passed
away
from
ourselves
forgetting
all
the
immortal
moods
that
faded
the
god
who
died
hastening
away
to
the
king
on
a
distant
call
there
were
ruby
dews
were
shed
when
the
heart
was
riven
and
passionate
pleading
and
prayers
to
the
dead
we
had
wronged
and
we
passed
away
unremembering
and
unforgiven
hastening
away
to
the
king
for
the
peace
we
longed
love
unremembered
and
we
left
behind
we
forsook
them
unheeding
hastening
away
in
our
flight
we
knew
the
hearts
we
had
wronged
of
old
we
would
find
when
we
came
to
the
fold
of
the
king
for
rest
in
the
night
dana
i
am
the
tender
voice
calling
away
whispering
between
the
beatings
of
the
heart
and
inaccessible
in
dewy
eyes
i
dwell
and
all
unkissed
on
lovely
lips
lingering
between
white
breasts
inviolate
and
fleeting
ever
from
the
passionate
touch
i
shine
afar
till
men
may
not
divine
whether
it
is
the
stars
or
the
beloved
they
follow
with
rapt
spirit
and
i
weave
my
spells
at
evening
folding
with
dim
caress
aerial
arms
and
twilight
dropping
hair
the
lonely
wanderer
by
wood
or
shore
till
filled
with
some
deep
tenderness
he
yields
feeling
in
dreams
for
the
dear
mother
heart
he
knew
ere
he
forsook
the
starry
way
and
clings
there
pillowed
far
above
the
smoke
and
the
dim
murmur
from
the
duns
of
men
i
can
enchant
the
trees
and
rocks
and
fill
the
dumb
brown
lips
of
earth
with
mystery
make
them
reveal
or
hide
the
god
i
breathe
a
deeper
pity
than
all
love
myself
mother
of
all
but
without
hands
to
heal
too
vast
and
vague
they
know
me
not
but
yet
i
am
the
heartbreak
over
fallen
things
the
sudden
gentleness
that
stays
the
blow
and
i
am
in
the
kiss
that
foemen
give
pausing
in
battle
and
in
the
tears
that
fall
over
the
vanquished
foe
and
in
the
highest
among
the
danaan
gods
i
am
the
last
council
of
mercy
in
their
hearts
where
they
mete
justice
from
a
thousand
starry
thrones
the
grey
eros
we
are
desert
leagues
apart
time
is
misty
ages
now
since
the
warmth
of
heart
to
heart
chased
the
shadows
from
my
brow
oh
i
am
so
old
meseems
i
am
next
of
kin
to
time
the
historian
of
her
dreams
from
the
prime
you
have
come
a
path
of
flowers
what
a
way
was
mine
to
roam
many
a
fallen
empire
towers
many
a
ruined
heart
my
home
no
there
is
no
comfort
none
all
the
dewy
tender
breath
idly
falls
when
life
is
done
on
the
starless
brow
of
death
though
the
dream
of
love
may
tire
in
the
ages
long
agone
there
were
ruby
hearts
of
fire
ah
the
daughters
of
the
dawn
though
i
am
so
feeble
now
i
remember
when
our
pride
could
not
to
the
mighty
bow
we
would
sweep
his
stars
aside
mix
thy
youth
with
thoughts
like
those
it
were
but
to
wither
thee
but
to
graft
the
youthful
rose
on
the
old
and
flowerless
tree
age
is
no
more
near
than
youth
to
the
sceptre
and
the
crown
vain
the
wisdom
vain
the
truth
do
not
lay
thy
rapture
down
rest
on
me
to
rest
my
bird
my
bird
the
swaying
branches
of
my
heart
are
blown
by
every
wind
toward
the
home
whereto
their
wings
depart
build
not
your
nest
my
bird
on
me
i
know
no
peace
but
ever
sway
o
lovely
bird
be
free
be
free
on
the
wild
music
of
the
day
but
sometimes
when
your
wings
would
rest
and
winds
are
laid
on
quiet
eves
come
i
will
bear
you
breast
to
breast
and
lap
you
close
with
loving
leaves
the
nuts
of
knowledge
a
cabin
on
the
mountain
side
hid
in
a
grassy
nook
where
door
and
windows
open
wide
that
friendly
stars
may
look
the
rabbit
shy
can
patter
in
the
winds
may
enter
free
who
throng
around
the
mountain
throne
in
living
ecstasy
and
when
the
sun
sets
dimmed
in
eve
and
purple
fills
the
air
i
think
the
sacred
hazel
tree
is
dropping
berries
there
from
starry
fruitage
waved
aloft
where
connla
well
for
sure
the
enchanted
waters
run
through
every
wind
that
blows
i
think
when
night
towers
up
aloft
and
shakes
the
trembling
dew
how
every
high
and
lonely
thought
that
thrills
my
being
through
is
but
a
ruddy
berry
dropped
down
through
the
purple
air
and
from
the
magic
tree
of
life
the
fruit
falls
everywhere
the
burning
glass
a
shaft
of
fire
that
falls
like
dew
and
melts
and
maddens
all
my
blood
from
out
thy
spirit
flashes
through
the
burning
glass
of
womanhood
only
so
far
here
must
i
stay
nearer
i
miss
the
light
the
fire
i
must
endure
the
torturing
ray
and
with
all
beauty
all
desire
ah
time
long
must
the
effort
be
and
far
the
way
that
i
must
go
to
bring
my
spirit
unto
thee
behind
the
glass
within
the
glow
the
twilight
of
earth
the
wonder
of
the
world
is
the
magic
from
the
sea
is
gone
there
is
no
unimagined
shore
no
islet
yet
to
venture
on
the
sacred
hazels
blooms
are
shed
the
nuts
of
knowledge
harvested
oh
what
is
worth
this
lore
of
age
if
time
shall
never
bring
us
back
our
battle
with
the
gods
to
wage
reeling
along
the
starry
track
the
battle
rapture
here
goes
by
in
warring
upon
things
that
die
let
be
the
tale
of
him
whose
love
was
sighed
between
white
deirdre
breasts
it
will
not
lift
the
heart
above
the
sodden
clay
on
which
it
rests
love
once
had
power
the
gods
to
bring
all
rapt
on
its
wild
wandering
we
shiver
in
the
falling
dew
and
seek
a
shelter
from
the
storm
when
man
these
elder
brothers
knew
he
found
the
mother
nature
warm
a
hearth
fire
blazing
through
it
all
a
home
without
a
circling
wall
we
dwindle
down
beneath
the
skies
and
from
ourselves
we
pass
away
the
paradise
of
memories
grows
ever
fainter
day
by
day
the
shepherd
stars
have
shrunk
within
the
world
great
night
will
soon
begin
will
no
one
ere
it
is
too
late
ere
fades
the
last
memorial
gleam
recall
for
us
our
earlier
state
for
nothing
but
so
vast
a
dream
that
it
would
scale
the
steeps
of
air
could
rouse
us
from
so
vast
despair
the
power
is
ours
to
make
or
mar
our
fate
as
on
the
earliest
morn
the
darkness
and
the
radiance
are
creatures
within
the
spirit
born
yet
bathed
in
gloom
too
long
we
might
forget
how
we
imagined
light
not
yet
are
fixed
the
prison
bars
the
hidden
light
the
spirit
owns
if
blown
to
flame
would
dim
the
stars
and
they
who
rule
them
from
their
thrones
and
the
proud
sceptred
spirits
thence
would
bow
to
pay
us
reverence
oh
while
the
glory
sinks
within
let
us
not
wait
on
earth
behind
but
follow
where
it
flies
and
win
the
glow
again
and
we
may
find
beyond
the
gateways
of
the
day
dominion
and
ancestral
sway
night
burning
our
hearts
out
with
longing
the
daylight
passed
millions
and
millions
together
the
stars
at
last
purple
the
woods
where
the
dewdrops
pearly
and
grey
wash
in
the
cool
from
our
faces
the
flame
of
day
glory
and
shadow
grow
one
in
the
hazel
wood
laughter
and
peace
in
the
stillness
together
brood
hopes
all
unearthly
are
thronging
in
hearts
of
earth
tongues
of
the
starlight
are
calling
our
souls
to
birth
down
from
the
heaven
its
secrets
drop
one
by
one
where
time
is
for
ever
beginning
and
time
is
done
there
light
eternal
is
over
chaos
and
night
singing
with
dawn
lips
for
ever
let
there
be
light
there
too
for
ever
in
twilight
time
slips
away
closing
in
darkness
and
rapture
its
awful
day
the
morning
star
in
the
black
pool
of
the
midnight
lugh
has
slung
the
morning
star
and
its
foam
in
rippling
silver
whitens
into
day
afar
falling
on
the
mountain
rampart
piled
with
pearl
above
our
glen
only
you
and
i
beloved
moving
in
the
fields
of
men
in
the
dark
tarn
of
my
spirit
love
the
morning
star
is
lit
and
its
halo
ever
brightening
lightens
into
dawn
in
it
love
a
dawn
in
darkness
breathing
peace
without
desire
but
i
fain
would
shun
the
burning
terrors
of
the
fire
through
the
faint
and
tender
airs
of
twilight
star
on
star
may
gaze
but
the
eyes
of
light
are
blinded
in
the
white
flame
of
the
days
from
the
heat
that
melts
together
oft
a
rarer
essence
slips
and
our
hearts
may
still
be
parted
in
the
meeting
of
the
lips
what
a
darkness
would
i
gaze
on
when
the
day
had
passed
the
west
if
my
eyes
were
dazed
and
blinded
by
the
whiteness
of
a
breast
never
through
the
diamond
darkness
could
i
hope
to
see
afar
where
beyond
the
pearly
rampart
burned
the
purer
evening
star
a
farewell
i
go
down
from
the
hills
half
in
gladness
and
half
with
a
pain
i
depart
where
the
mother
with
gentlest
breathing
made
music
on
lip
and
in
heart
for
i
know
that
my
childhood
is
over
a
call
comes
out
of
the
vast
and
the
love
that
i
had
in
the
old
time
like
beauty
in
twilight
is
past
i
am
fired
by
a
danaan
whisper
of
battles
afar
in
the
world
and
my
thought
is
no
longer
of
peace
for
the
banners
in
dream
are
unfurled
and
i
pass
from
the
council
of
stars
and
of
hills
to
a
life
that
is
new
and
i
bid
to
you
stars
and
you
mountains
a
tremulous
long
adieu
i
will
come
once
again
as
a
master
who
played
here
as
child
in
my
dawn
i
will
enter
the
heart
of
the
hills
where
the
gods
of
the
old
world
are
gone
and
will
war
like
the
bright
hound
of
ulla
with
princes
of
earth
and
of
sky
for
my
dream
is
to
conquer
the
heavens
and
battle
for
kingship
on
high
the
message
do
you
not
feel
the
white
glow
in
your
breast
my
bird
that
is
the
flame
of
love
i
send
to
you
from
afar
not
a
wafted
kiss
hardly
a
whispered
word
but
love
itself
that
flies
as
a
star
let
it
dwell
there
let
it
rest
there
at
home
in
your
heart
wafted
on
winds
of
gold
it
is
love
itself
the
dove
not
the
god
whose
arrows
wounded
with
bitter
smart
nor
the
birds
of
death
and
love
do
not
ask
for
the
hands
of
love
or
love
soft
eyes
they
give
less
than
love
who
give
all
giving
what
wanes
i
give
you
the
the
to
paradise
with
no
death
after
no
arrow
with
stinging
pains
at
one
sometimes
a
sudden
fount
of
tears
jets
in
my
heart
and
golden
gleams
will
through
my
being
dart
your
cry
or
laugh
my
sweet
though
we
are
far
apart
above
this
hidden
fount
i
bend
and
whisper
clear
more
words
of
fonder
love
than
if
your
heart
were
near
more
tenderly
than
if
my
arms
were
round
you
dear
i
feel
your
gay
love
lights
such
love
in
me
afar
i
would
not
have
you
near
for
eyes
and
lips
might
mar
the
silence
where
we
meet
and
star
is
lost
in
star
i
think
of
you
in
peace
though
under
alien
skies
though
death
itself
bereft
your
love
in
me
would
rise
in
rainbow
ripples
borne
from
your
heart
in
paradise
the
well
of
all
healing
there
a
cure
for
all
things
in
the
well
at
ballylee
where
the
scarlet
cressets
hang
over
the
trembling
pool
and
joyful
winds
are
blowing
from
the
land
of
youth
to
me
and
the
heart
of
the
earth
is
full
many
and
many
a
sunbright
maiden
saw
the
enchanted
land
with
star
faces
glimmer
up
from
the
druid
wave
many
and
many
a
pain
of
love
was
soothed
by
a
faery
hand
or
lost
in
the
love
it
gave
when
the
quiet
with
a
ring
of
pearl
shall
wed
the
earth
and
the
scarlet
berries
burn
dark
by
the
stars
in
the
pool
oh
it
lost
and
deep
i
be
amid
the
windy
mirth
while
the
heart
of
the
earth
is
full
a
new
being
i
know
myself
no
more
my
child
since
thou
art
come
to
me
pity
so
tender
and
so
wild
hath
wrapped
my
thoughts
of
thee
these
thoughts
a
fiery
gentle
rain
are
from
the
mother
shed
where
many
a
broken
heart
hath
lain
and
many
a
weeping
head
a
call
of
the
sidhe
tarry
thou
yet
late
lingerer
in
the
twilight
glory
gay
are
the
hills
with
song
earth
faery
children
leave
more
dim
abodes
to
roam
the
eve
opening
their
glimmering
lips
to
breathe
some
wondrous
story
hush
not
a
whisper
let
your
heart
alone
go
dreaming
dream
unto
dream
may
pass
deep
in
the
heart
alone
murmurs
the
mighty
one
his
solemn
undertone
canst
thou
not
see
down
the
silver
cloudland
streaming
rivers
of
faery
light
dewdrop
on
dewdrop
falling
of
silver
flames
lighting
the
dark
beneath
and
what
enraptured
hosts
burn
on
the
dusky
heath
come
thou
away
with
them
for
heaven
to
earth
is
calling
these
are
earth
voice
her
answer
spirits
thronging
come
to
the
land
of
youth
the
trees
grown
heavy
there
drop
on
the
purple
wave
the
starry
fruit
they
bear
drink
the
immortal
waters
quench
the
spirit
longing
art
thou
not
now
bright
one
all
sorrow
past
in
elation
made
young
with
joy
grown
with
the
vast
whither
thy
spirit
wending
flits
the
dim
stars
past
unto
the
light
of
lights
in
burning
adoration
love
from
afar
a
burning
fire
rose
up
within
me
you
were
away
long
miles
apart
you
could
not
wait
the
day
to
win
me
but
came
a
lightning
to
my
heart
i
call
into
that
flaming
centre
spirit
i
love
you
far
away
fades
from
the
paradise
i
enter
the
dim
unreal
land
of
day
babylon
the
blue
dusk
ran
between
the
streets
my
love
was
winged
within
my
mind
it
left
and
yesterday
and
thrice
a
thousand
years
behind
was
past
and
dead
for
me
for
from
my
feet
had
run
through
thrice
a
thousand
years
to
walk
the
ways
of
ancient
babylon
on
temple
top
and
palace
roof
the
burnished
gold
flung
back
the
rays
of
a
red
sunset
that
was
dead
and
lost
beyond
a
million
days
the
tower
of
heaven
turns
darker
blue
a
starry
sparkle
now
begins
the
mystery
and
magnificence
the
myriad
beauty
and
the
sins
come
back
to
me
i
walk
beneath
the
shadowy
multitude
of
towers
within
the
gloom
the
fountain
jets
its
pallid
mist
in
lily
flowers
the
waters
lull
me
and
the
scent
of
many
gardens
and
i
hear
familiar
voices
and
the
voice
i
love
is
whispering
in
my
ear
oh
real
as
in
dream
all
this
and
then
a
hand
on
mine
is
laid
the
wave
of
phantom
time
withdraws
and
that
young
babylonian
maid
one
drop
of
beauty
left
behind
from
all
the
flowing
of
that
tide
is
looking
with
the
eyes
and
here
in
ireland
by
my
side
oh
light
our
life
in
babylon
but
babylon
has
taken
wings
while
we
are
in
the
calm
and
proud
procession
of
eternal
things
the
silence
of
love
i
could
praise
you
once
with
beautiful
words
ere
you
came
and
entered
my
life
with
love
in
a
wind
of
flame
i
could
lure
with
a
song
from
afar
my
bird
to
its
nest
but
with
pinions
drooping
together
silence
is
best
in
the
land
of
beautiful
silence
the
winds
are
laid
and
life
grows
quietly
one
in
the
cloudy
shade
i
will
not
waken
the
passion
that
sleeps
in
the
heart
for
the
winds
that
blew
us
together
may
blow
us
apart
fear
not
the
stillness
for
doubt
and
despair
shall
cease
with
the
gentle
voices
guiding
us
into
peace
our
dreams
will
change
as
they
pass
through
the
gates
of
gold
and
quiet
the
tender
shepherd
shall
keep
the
fold
aphrodite
not
unremembering
we
pass
our
exile
from
the
starry
ways
one
timeless
hour
in
time
we
caught
from
the
long
night
of
endless
days
with
solemn
gaiety
the
stars
danced
far
withdrawn
on
elfin
heights
the
lilac
breathed
amid
the
shade
of
green
and
blue
and
citron
lights
but
yet
the
close
enfolding
night
seemed
on
the
phantom
verge
of
things
for
our
adoring
hearts
had
turned
within
from
all
their
wanderings
for
beauty
called
to
beauty
and
there
thronged
at
the
enchanter
will
the
vanished
hours
of
love
that
burn
within
the
still
and
sweet
eternal
faces
put
the
shadows
of
the
earth
to
rout
and
faint
and
fragile
as
a
moth
your
white
hand
fluttered
and
went
out
oh
who
am
i
who
tower
beside
this
goddess
of
the
twilight
air
the
burning
doves
fly
from
my
heart
and
melt
within
her
bosom
there
i
know
the
sacrifice
of
old
they
offered
to
the
mighty
queen
and
this
adoring
love
has
brought
us
back
the
beauty
that
has
been
as
to
her
worshippers
she
came
descending
from
her
glowing
skies
so
aphrodite
i
have
seen
with
shining
eyes
look
through
your
eyes
one
gleam
of
the
ancestral
face
which
lighted
up
the
dawn
for
me
one
fiery
visitation
of
the
love
the
gods
desire
in
thee
refuge
twilight
a
timid
fawn
went
glimmering
by
and
night
the
hunter
followed
fast
ceaseless
pursuit
and
flight
were
in
the
sky
but
the
long
chase
had
ceased
for
us
at
last
we
watched
together
while
the
driven
fawn
hid
in
the
golden
thicket
of
the
day
we
from
whose
hearts
pursuit
and
flight
were
gone
knew
on
the
hunter
breast
her
refuge
lay
the
faces
of
memory
dream
faces
bloom
around
your
face
like
flowers
upon
one
stem
the
heart
of
many
a
vanished
race
sighs
as
i
look
on
them
the
sun
rich
face
of
egypt
glows
the
eyes
of
eire
brood
with
whom
the
golden
cyprian
shows
in
lovely
sisterhood
your
tree
put
forth
these
phantom
flowers
in
ages
past
away
they
had
the
love
in
other
hours
i
give
to
you
one
light
their
eyes
have
as
may
shine
one
star
on
many
a
sea
they
look
that
tender
love
on
mine
that
lights
your
glance
on
me
they
fade
in
you
their
lips
are
fain
to
meet
the
old
caress
and
all
their
love
is
mine
again
as
lip
to
lip
we
press
the
secret
love
you
and
i
have
found
the
secret
way
none
can
bar
our
love
or
say
us
nay
all
the
world
may
stare
and
never
know
you
and
i
are
twined
together
so
you
and
i
for
all
his
vaunted
width
know
the
giant
space
is
but
a
myth
over
miles
and
miles
of
pure
deceit
you
and
i
have
found
our
lips
can
meet
you
and
i
have
laughed
the
leagues
apart
in
the
soft
delight
of
heart
to
heart
if
there
a
gulf
to
meet
or
limit
set
you
and
i
have
never
found
it
yet
you
and
i
have
trod
the
backward
way
to
the
happy
heart
of
yesterday
to
the
love
we
felt
in
ages
past
you
and
i
have
found
it
still
to
last
you
and
i
have
found
the
joy
had
birth
in
the
angel
childhood
of
the
earth
hid
within
the
heart
of
man
and
maid
you
and
i
of
time
are
not
afraid
you
and
i
can
mock
his
fabled
wing
for
a
kiss
is
an
immortal
thing
and
the
throb
wherein
those
old
lips
met
is
a
living
music
in
us
yet
the
weaver
of
souls
who
is
this
unseen
messenger
for
ever
between
me
and
her
who
brings
love
precious
merchandise
the
golden
breath
the
dew
of
sighs
and
the
wild
gentle
thoughts
that
dwell
too
fragile
for
the
lips
to
tell
each
at
their
birth
to
us
before
a
heaving
of
the
heart
is
who
art
thou
unseen
messenger
i
think
o
angel
of
the
lord
you
make
our
hearts
to
so
accord
that
those
who
hear
in
after
hours
may
sigh
for
love
as
deep
as
ours
and
seek
the
magic
that
can
give
an
eden
where
the
soul
may
live
nor
need
to
walk
a
road
of
clay
with
stumbling
feet
nor
fall
away
from
thee
o
angel
of
the
lord
transformation
in
other
climes
as
the
times
shall
fleet
you
yet
may
the
hero
be
and
a
loving
heart
may
beat
my
sweet
in
a
woman
breast
for
thee
your
flight
shall
be
in
the
height
above
my
wings
droop
low
on
the
lea
for
the
eagle
must
grow
a
dove
my
love
and
the
dove
an
eagle
be
children
of
lir
we
woke
from
our
sleep
in
the
bosom
where
cradled
together
we
lay
the
love
of
the
dark
hidden
father
went
with
us
upon
our
way
and
gay
was
the
breath
in
our
being
and
never
a
sorrow
or
fear
was
on
us
as
singing
together
we
flew
from
the
infinite
lir
through
nights
lit
with
diamond
and
sapphire
we
raced
with
the
children
of
dawn
a
chain
that
was
silver
and
golden
linked
spirit
to
spirit
my
swan
till
day
in
the
heavens
passed
over
and
still
grew
the
beat
of
our
wings
and
the
breath
of
the
darkness
enfolded
to
teach
us
unspeakable
things
yet
lower
we
fell
and
for
comfort
our
pinionless
spirits
had
now
the
leaning
of
bosom
to
bosom
the
lifting
of
lip
unto
brow
though
chained
to
the
earth
yet
we
mourned
not
the
loss
of
our
heaven
above
but
passed
from
the
vision
of
beauty
to
the
fathomless
being
of
love
still
gay
is
the
breath
in
our
being
we
wait
for
the
bell
branch
to
ring
to
call
us
away
to
the
father
and
then
we
will
rise
on
the
wing
and
fly
through
the
twilights
of
time
till
the
home
lights
of
heaven
appear
our
spirits
through
love
and
through
longing
made
one
in
the
infinite
lir
light
and
dark
not
the
soul
that
whitest
wakens
love
the
sweetest
when
the
heart
is
lightest
oft
the
charm
is
fleetest
while
the
maiden
waits
the
time
of
learning
to
the
passion
laden
turn
with
eager
yearning
while
the
heart
is
burning
heaven
with
earth
is
banded
to
the
stars
returning
go
not
ah
the
maiden
somehow
truth
has
missed
her
left
the
heart
unladen
for
its
burdened
sister
twilight
by
the
cabin
dusk
a
river
hill
and
vale
puts
out
the
day
what
do
you
wonder
at
asthore
what
away
in
yonder
grey
dark
the
eyes
that
linger
long
heart
awake
come
in
warm
the
hearth
and
gay
the
song
love
with
tender
words
would
win
fades
the
eve
in
dreamy
fire
but
the
heart
of
night
is
lit
ancient
beauty
old
desire
by
the
cabin
doorway
flit
this
is
etain
land
and
line
and
the
homespun
can
not
hide
kinship
with
a
race
divine
thrill
of
rapture
light
of
pride
there
her
golden
kinsmen
are
and
her
heart
a
moment
knew
angus
like
the
evening
star
fleeting
through
the
dusk
and
dew
throw
the
woman
mask
away
wear
the
opal
glimmering
dress
let
the
feathered
starlight
ray
over
every
gleaming
tress
child
of
etain
wherefore
leave
light
and
laughter
joyful
years
for
the
earth
grey
coloured
eve
ever
dropping
down
with
tears
was
it
for
some
love
of
old
ah
reveal
thyself
the
bars
on
the
gateway
would
not
hold
he
will
follow
to
the
stars
beauty
my
spirit
would
have
beauty
to
build
its
magic
art
come
hither
star
of
evening
and
dwell
within
my
heart
oh
twilight
fall
in
pearl
dew
each
healing
drop
may
bring
some
image
of
the
song
the
quiet
seems
to
sing
my
spirit
would
have
beauty
to
offer
at
the
shrine
and
turn
dull
earth
to
gold
and
water
into
wine
and
burn
in
fiery
dreams
each
thought
till
thrice
refined
it
may
have
power
to
mirror
the
mighty
master
mind
my
spirit
would
have
beauty
to
draw
thee
nigh
my
bird
i
seek
the
lips
that
spake
thee
sung
thee
a
starry
word
i
breathe
anew
that
music
and
lure
thee
from
afar
and
still
thy
quivering
pinions
at
peace
in
thy
own
star
the
vision
of
love
the
twilight
fleeted
away
in
pearl
on
the
stream
and
night
like
a
diamond
dome
stood
still
in
our
dream
your
eyes
like
burnished
stones
or
as
stars
were
bright
with
the
sudden
vision
that
made
us
one
with
the
night
we
loved
in
infinite
spaces
forgetting
here
the
breasts
that
were
lit
with
life
and
the
lips
so
near
till
the
wizard
willows
waved
in
the
wind
and
drew
me
away
from
the
fulness
of
love
and
down
to
you
our
love
was
so
vast
that
it
filled
the
heavens
up
but
the
soft
white
form
i
held
was
an
empty
cup
when
the
willows
called
me
back
to
earth
with
their
sigh
and
we
moved
as
shades
through
the
deep
that
was
you
and
i
a
memory
you
remember
dear
together
two
children
you
and
i
sat
once
in
the
autumn
weather
watching
the
autumn
sky
there
was
some
one
round
us
straying
the
whole
of
the
long
day
through
who
seemed
to
say
i
am
playing
at
hide
and
seek
with
you
and
one
thing
after
another
was
whispered
out
of
the
air
how
god
was
a
big
kind
brother
whose
home
is
in
everywhere
his
light
like
a
smile
comes
glancing
through
the
cool
cool
winds
as
they
pass
from
the
flowers
in
heaven
dancing
to
the
stars
that
shine
in
the
grass
from
the
clouds
in
deep
blue
wreathing
and
most
from
the
mountains
tall
but
god
like
a
wind
goes
breathing
a
dream
of
himself
in
all
the
heart
of
the
wise
was
beating
sweet
sweet
in
our
hearts
that
day
and
many
a
thought
came
fleeting
and
fancies
solemn
and
gay
we
were
grave
in
our
way
divining
how
childhood
was
taking
wings
and
the
wonder
world
was
shining
with
vast
eternal
things
the
solemn
twilight
fluttered
like
the
plumes
of
seraphim
and
we
felt
what
things
were
uttered
in
the
sunset
voice
of
him
we
lingered
long
for
dearer
than
home
were
the
mountain
places
where
god
from
the
stars
dropt
nearer
our
pale
dreamy
faces
our
very
hearts
from
beating
we
stilled
in
awed
delight
for
spirit
and
children
were
meeting
in
the
purple
ample
night
a
summer
night
her
mist
of
primroses
within
her
breast
twilight
hath
folded
up
and
the
west
seeking
remoter
valleys
long
hath
gone
not
yet
hath
come
her
sister
of
the
dawn
silence
and
coolness
now
the
earth
enfold
jewels
of
glittering
green
long
mists
of
gold
hazes
of
nebulous
silver
veil
the
height
and
shake
in
tremors
through
the
shadowy
night
heard
through
the
stillness
as
in
whispered
words
the
wandering
wings
of
birds
ruffle
the
dark
the
little
lives
that
lie
deep
hid
in
grass
join
in
a
sigh
more
softly
still
and
unheard
through
the
blue
the
falling
of
innumerable
dew
lifts
with
grey
fingers
all
the
leaves
that
lay
burned
in
the
heat
of
the
consuming
day
the
lawns
and
lakes
lie
in
this
night
of
love
admitted
to
the
majesty
above
earth
with
the
starry
company
hath
part
the
waters
hold
all
heaven
within
their
heart
and
glimmer
with
everywhere
lifted
to
meet
the
angel
lips
of
air
the
many
homes
of
men
shine
near
and
far
as
the
tender
evening
star
the
late
folk
anticipate
their
rest
beyond
the
passing
of
the
gate
and
tread
with
hearts
and
drowsy
feet
oh
far
away
and
wonderful
and
sweet
all
this
all
this
but
far
too
many
things
obscuring
as
a
cloud
of
seraph
wings
blinding
the
seeker
for
the
lord
behind
i
fall
away
in
weariness
of
mind
and
think
how
far
apart
are
i
and
you
beloved
from
those
spirit
children
who
felt
but
one
single
being
long
ago
whispering
in
gentleness
and
leaning
low
out
of
its
majesty
as
child
to
child
i
think
upon
it
all
with
heart
grown
wild
hearing
no
voice
my
spirit
broods
no
whisper
from
the
dense
infinitudes
this
world
of
myriad
things
whose
distance
awes
ah
me
how
innocent
our
childhood
was
whom
we
worship
i
would
not
have
the
love
of
lips
and
eyes
the
ancient
ways
of
love
but
in
my
heart
i
built
a
paradise
a
nest
there
for
the
dove
i
felt
the
wings
of
light
that
fluttered
through
the
gate
i
held
apart
and
all
without
was
shadow
but
i
knew
the
bird
within
my
heart
then
while
the
innermost
with
music
beat
the
voice
i
loved
so
long
seemed
only
the
dream
echo
faint
and
sweet
of
a
far
sweeter
song
i
could
not
even
bear
the
thought
i
felt
of
thee
and
me
therein
and
with
white
heat
i
strove
the
veil
to
melt
that
love
to
love
might
win
but
ah
my
dreams
within
their
fountain
fell
not
to
be
lost
in
thee
but
with
the
high
ancestral
love
to
dwell
in
its
lone
ecstasy
mistrust
you
look
at
me
with
wan
bright
eyes
when
in
the
deeper
world
i
stray
you
fear
some
hidden
ambush
lies
in
wait
to
call
me
come
away
what
if
i
see
behind
the
veil
your
starry
self
beseeching
me
or
at
its
stern
command
grow
pale
let
her
be
free
let
her
be
free
the
dream
i
woke
to
find
my
pillow
wet
with
tears
for
deeds
deep
hid
in
sleep
i
knew
no
sorrow
here
but
yet
the
tears
fell
softly
through
the
deep
your
eyes
your
other
eyes
of
dream
looked
at
me
through
the
veil
of
blank
i
saw
their
joyous
starlit
gleam
like
one
who
watches
rank
on
rank
his
victor
airy
legions
wind
and
pass
before
his
awful
throne
was
there
thy
loving
heart
unkind
was
i
thy
captive
all
the
feast
of
age
see
where
the
light
streams
over
connla
fountain
starward
aspire
the
sacred
sign
upon
the
holy
mountain
shines
in
white
fire
wavering
and
flaming
yonder
the
snows
the
diamond
light
melts
into
silver
or
to
sapphire
glows
night
beyond
night
and
from
the
heaven
of
heaven
descends
on
earth
a
dew
divine
come
let
us
mingle
in
the
starry
mirth
around
the
shrine
o
earth
enchantress
mother
to
our
home
in
thee
we
press
thrilled
by
thy
fiery
breath
and
wrapt
in
some
vast
tenderness
the
homeward
birds
uncertain
their
nest
wheel
in
the
dome
fraught
with
dim
dreams
of
more
enraptured
rest
another
home
but
gather
ye
to
whose
undarkened
eyes
night
is
as
day
leap
forth
immortals
birds
of
paradise
in
bright
array
robed
like
the
shining
tresses
of
the
sun
and
by
his
name
call
from
his
haunt
divine
the
ancient
one
our
father
flame
aye
from
the
wonder
light
heart
of
our
star
come
now
come
now
spirit
ray
thy
lights
afar
thy
children
bow
hush
with
more
awe
the
heart
the
races
are
nothing
worth
by
those
dread
gods
from
out
whose
awful
faces
the
earth
looks
forth
infinite
pity
set
in
calm
whose
vision
cast
adown
the
years
beholds
how
beauty
burns
away
at
last
their
children
tears
now
while
our
hearts
the
ancient
quietness
floods
with
its
tide
the
things
of
air
and
fire
and
height
no
less
in
it
abide
and
from
their
wanderings
over
sea
and
shore
they
rise
as
one
unto
the
vastness
and
with
us
adore
the
midnight
sun
and
enter
the
innumerable
all
and
shine
like
gold
and
starlike
gleam
in
the
immortal
hall
the
heavenly
fold
and
drink
the
from
the
mother
lips
awhile
and
then
fail
from
the
light
and
drop
in
dark
eclipse
to
earth
again
roaming
along
by
promontory
and
valley
dim
weaving
a
phantom
image
of
the
glory
they
knew
in
him
out
of
the
fulness
flow
the
winds
their
song
is
heard
no
more
or
hardly
breathes
a
mystic
sound
along
the
dreamy
shore
blindly
they
move
unknowing
as
in
trance
their
wandering
is
half
with
us
and
half
an
inner
dance
led
by
the
king
a
way
of
escape
there
a
way
of
escape
through
the
gate
of
sorrow
a
light
at
the
end
of
the
path
of
pain
but
our
joy
and
our
love
can
have
no
and
to
drink
is
to
sink
to
the
earth
again
there
is
death
in
the
breath
when
our
lips
draw
nigher
and
we
lay
waste
the
plain
for
a
flower
to
grow
and
we
build
up
the
tower
of
an
hour
desire
with
dust
from
the
pit
of
its
overthrow
recall
what
call
may
draw
thee
back
again
lost
dove
what
art
what
charm
may
please
the
tender
touch
the
kiss
are
vain
for
thou
wert
lured
away
by
these
oh
must
we
use
the
iron
hand
and
mask
with
hate
the
holy
breath
with
alien
voice
give
love
command
as
they
through
love
the
call
of
death
the
voice
of
the
waters
where
the
greyhound
river
windeth
through
a
loneliness
so
deep
scarce
a
wild
fowl
shakes
the
quiet
that
the
purple
boglands
keep
only
god
exults
in
silence
over
fields
no
man
may
reap
where
the
silver
wave
with
sweetness
fed
the
tiny
lives
of
grass
i
was
bent
above
my
image
mirrored
in
the
fleeting
glass
and
a
voice
from
out
the
water
through
my
being
seemed
to
pass
still
above
the
waters
brooding
spirit
in
thy
timeless
quest
was
the
glory
of
thine
image
trembling
over
east
and
west
not
divine
enough
when
mirrored
in
the
morning
water
breast
with
the
sighing
voice
that
murmured
i
was
borne
to
ages
dim
ere
the
void
was
lit
with
beauty
breathed
upon
by
seraphim
we
were
cradled
there
together
folded
in
the
peace
in
him
one
to
be
the
master
spirit
one
to
be
the
slave
awoke
one
to
shape
itself
obedient
to
the
fiery
words
we
spoke
flame
and
flood
and
stars
and
mountains
from
the
primal
waters
broke
i
was
huddled
in
the
heather
when
the
vision
failed
its
light
still
and
blue
and
vast
above
me
towered
aloft
the
solemn
height
where
the
stars
like
dewdrops
glistened
on
the
mountain
slope
of
night
in
connemara
with
eyes
all
untroubled
she
laughs
as
she
passes
bending
beneath
the
creel
with
the
seaweed
brown
till
evening
with
dims
the
shining
grasses
and
night
lit
with
dreamlight
enfolds
the
sleepy
town
then
she
will
wander
her
heart
all
a
laughter
tracking
the
dream
star
that
lights
the
purple
gloom
she
follows
the
proud
and
golden
races
after
as
high
as
theirs
her
spirit
as
high
will
be
her
doom
an
irish
face
not
her
own
sorrow
only
that
hath
place
upon
yon
gentle
face
too
slight
have
been
her
childhood
years
to
gain
the
imprint
of
such
pain
it
hid
behind
her
laughing
hours
and
wrought
each
curve
in
saddest
thought
on
brow
and
lips
and
eyes
with
subtle
art
it
made
that
little
heart
through
its
young
joyous
beatings
to
prepare
a
quiet
shelter
there
where
the
immortal
sorrows
might
find
a
home
and
many
there
have
come
bowed
in
a
mournful
mist
of
golden
hair
deirdre
hath
entered
there
and
shrouded
in
a
fall
of
pitying
dew
weeping
the
friend
he
slew
the
hound
of
ulla
lies
with
those
who
shed
tears
for
the
wild
geese
fled
and
all
the
lovers
on
whom
fate
had
warred
cutting
the
silver
cord
enter
and
softly
breath
by
breath
they
mould
the
young
heart
to
the
old
the
old
protest
the
old
pity
whose
power
are
gathering
to
the
hour
when
their
knit
silence
shall
be
mightier
far
than
leagued
empires
are
and
dreaming
of
the
sorrow
on
this
face
we
grow
of
lordlier
race
could
shake
the
rooted
rampart
of
the
hills
to
shield
her
from
all
ills
and
through
a
deep
adoring
pity
won
grow
what
we
dream
upon
hope
in
failure
though
now
thou
hast
failed
and
art
fallen
despair
not
because
of
defeat
though
lost
for
a
while
be
thy
heaven
and
weary
of
earth
be
thy
feet
for
all
will
be
beauty
about
thee
hereafter
through
sorrowful
years
and
lovely
the
dews
for
thy
chilling
and
ruby
thy
of
tears
the
eyes
that
had
gazed
from
afar
on
a
beauty
that
blinded
the
eyes
shall
call
forth
its
image
for
ever
its
shadow
in
alien
skies
the
heart
that
had
striven
to
beat
in
the
heart
of
the
mighty
too
soon
shall
still
of
that
beating
remember
some
errant
and
faltering
tune
for
thou
hast
but
fallen
to
gather
the
last
of
the
secrets
of
power
the
beauty
that
breathes
in
thy
spirit
shall
shape
of
thy
sorrow
a
flower
the
pale
bud
of
pity
shall
open
the
bloom
of
its
tenderest
rays
the
heart
of
whose
shining
is
bright
with
the
light
of
the
ancient
of
days
the
crown
i
wore
in
joy
a
radiant
star
its
rays
flew
forth
into
the
night
it
made
them
glad
who
watched
afar
and
filled
their
gloom
with
happy
light
their
eyes
no
more
the
light
may
win
and
all
the
loves
are
changed
to
scorns
the
rays
of
light
pierce
deep
within
the
star
is
now
my
crown
of
thorns
the
everlasting
battle
when
in
my
shadowy
hours
i
pierce
the
hidden
heart
of
hopes
and
fears
they
change
into
immortal
joys
or
end
in
immemorial
tears
moytura
battle
still
endures
and
in
this
human
heart
of
mine
the
golden
sun
powers
with
the
might
of
demon
darkness
intertwine
i
think
that
every
teardrop
shed
still
flows
from
balor
eye
of
doom
and
gazing
on
his
ageless
grief
my
heart
is
filled
with
ageless
gloom
i
close
my
eyes
and
in
my
bitter
spirit
brood
and
am
at
one
in
vast
despair
with
all
the
demon
multitude
but
in
the
lightning
flash
of
hope
i
feel
the
fiery
sling
has
smote
the
horror
in
the
heart
where
clouds
of
demon
glooms
take
wing
i
shake
my
heavy
fears
aside
and
seize
the
flaming
sword
of
will
i
am
of
dana
race
divine
and
know
i
am
immortal
still
ordeal
love
and
pity
are
pleading
with
me
this
hour
what
is
this
voice
that
stays
me
forbidding
to
yield
offering
beauty
love
and
immortal
power
Ã¦ons
away
in
some
heavenly
field
though
i
obey
thee
immortal
my
heart
is
sore
though
love
be
withdrawn
for
love
it
bitterly
grieves
pity
withheld
in
the
breast
makes
sorrow
more
oh
that
the
heart
could
feel
what
the
mind
believes
cease
o
love
thy
fiery
and
gentle
pleading
soft
is
thy
grief
but
in
tempest
through
me
it
rolls
dreamst
thou
not
whither
the
path
is
leading
where
the
dark
immortal
would
shepherd
our
weeping
souls
the
child
of
destiny
this
is
the
of
the
enchanted
isle
whom
now
the
twilight
children
tenderly
enfold
pat
with
their
pearly
palms
and
crown
with
elfin
gold
while
in
the
mountain
breast
his
brothers
watch
and
smile
who
now
of
dana
host
may
guide
these
dancing
feet
what
bright
immortal
hides
and
through
a
child
light
breath
laughs
an
immortal
joy
angus
of
love
and
death
returned
to
make
our
hearts
with
dream
and
music
beat
or
lugh
leaves
heavenly
wars
to
free
his
ancient
land
not
on
the
fiery
steed
maned
with
tumultuous
flame
as
in
the
fomor
days
the
sunbright
chieftain
came
but
in
this
dreaming
boy
more
subtle
conquest
planned
or
does
the
mother
brood
some
deed
of
sacrifice
her
heart
in
his
laid
bare
to
hosts
of
wounding
spears
till
love
immortal
melt
the
cruel
eyes
to
tears
or
on
his
brow
be
set
the
heroes
thorny
prize
see
as
some
shadows
of
a
darker
race
draw
near
how
he
compels
their
feet
with
what
a
proud
command
what
is
it
waves
and
gleams
is
that
a
silver
hand
whose
light
through
delicate
lifted
fingers
shines
so
clear
night
like
a
glowing
seraph
the
kingly
boy
watches
with
ardent
eyes
from
his
own
ancient
home
and
far
away
rocking
in
living
foam
the
three
great
waves
leap
up
exulting
in
their
joy
remembering
the
past
the
immemorial
deeds
the
danaan
gods
had
wrought
in
guise
of
mortal
men
their
elemental
hearts
madden
with
life
again
and
shaking
foamy
heads
toss
the
great
ocean
steeds
a
farewell
only
in
my
deep
heart
i
love
you
sweetest
heart
many
another
vesture
hath
the
soul
i
pray
call
me
not
forth
from
this
if
from
the
light
i
part
only
with
clay
i
cling
unto
the
clay
and
ah
my
bright
companion
you
and
i
must
go
our
ways
unfolding
lonely
glories
not
our
own
nor
from
each
other
gathered
but
an
inward
glow
breathed
by
the
lone
one
on
the
seeker
lone
if
for
the
heart
own
sake
we
break
the
heart
we
may
when
the
last
ruby
drop
dissolves
in
diamond
light
meet
in
a
deeper
vesture
in
another
day
until
that
dawn
dear
heart
the
parting
of
ways
the
skies
from
black
to
pearly
grey
had
veered
without
a
star
or
sun
only
a
burning
opal
ray
fell
on
your
brow
when
all
was
done
aye
after
victory
the
crown
yet
through
the
fight
no
word
of
cheer
and
what
would
win
and
what
go
down
no
word
could
help
no
light
make
clear
a
thousand
ages
onward
led
their
joys
and
sorrows
to
that
hour
no
wisdom
weighed
no
word
was
said
for
only
what
we
were
had
power
there
was
no
tender
leaning
there
of
brow
to
brow
in
loving
mood
for
we
were
rapt
apart
and
were
in
elemental
solitude
we
knew
not
in
redeeming
day
whether
our
spirits
would
be
found
floating
along
the
starry
way
or
in
the
earthly
vapours
drowned
brought
by
the
flame
to
earth
uncertain
yet
the
while
i
looked
at
you
there
slowly
came
noble
and
sisterly
your
smile
we
bade
adieu
to
love
the
old
we
heard
another
lover
then
whose
forms
are
myriad
and
untold
sigh
to
us
from
the
hearts
of
men
a
midnight
meditation
how
often
have
i
said
we
may
not
grieve
for
the
immortal
dead
and
now
poor
blenchÃ¨d
heart
thy
ruddy
hues
all
tremulous
depart
why
be
with
fate
at
strife
because
one
passes
on
from
death
to
life
who
may
no
more
delay
rapt
from
our
strange
and
pitiful
dream
away
by
one
with
ancient
claim
who
robes
her
with
the
spirit
like
a
flame
not
lost
this
high
belief
oh
passionate
heart
what
is
thy
cause
for
grief
is
this
thy
sorrow
now
she
in
eternal
beauty
may
not
bow
thy
troubles
to
efface
as
in
old
time
a
head
with
gentle
grace
all
tenderly
laid
by
thine
taught
thee
the
nearness
of
the
love
divine
her
joys
no
more
for
thee
than
the
impartial
laughter
of
the
sea
her
beauty
no
more
fair
for
thee
alone
but
starry
everywhere
her
pity
dropped
for
you
no
more
than
heaven
above
with
healing
dew
favours
one
home
of
men
ah
grieve
not
she
becomes
herself
again
and
passed
beyond
thy
sight
she
roams
along
the
fields
of
light
moving
in
dreams
until
she
finds
again
the
root
of
ancient
will
the
old
heroic
love
that
emptied
once
the
heavenly
courts
above
the
angels
heard
from
earth
a
mournful
cry
which
shattered
all
their
mirth
raised
by
a
senseless
rout
warring
in
chaos
with
discordant
shout
and
that
the
pain
might
cease
they
grew
rebellious
in
the
master
peace
and
falling
downward
then
the
angelic
lights
were
crucified
in
men
leaving
so
radiant
spheres
for
earth
dim
twilight
ever
wet
with
tears
that
through
those
shadows
dim
might
breathe
the
lovely
music
brought
from
him
and
now
my
grief
i
see
was
but
that
ancient
shadow
part
of
me
not
yet
attuned
to
good
still
blind
and
senseless
in
its
warring
mood
i
turn
from
it
and
climb
to
the
heroic
spirit
of
the
prime
the
light
that
well
foreknew
all
the
dark
ways
that
it
must
journey
through
yet
seeing
still
again
a
distant
glory
the
hills
of
pain
through
all
that
chaos
wild
a
breath
as
gentle
as
a
little
child
through
earth
transformed
divine
the
of
the
universe
to
shine
age
and
youth
we
have
left
our
youth
behind
earth
is
in
its
baby
years
void
of
wisdom
cries
the
wind
and
the
sunlight
knows
no
tears
when
shall
twilight
feel
the
awe
all
the
rapt
thought
of
the
sage
and
the
lips
of
wind
give
law
drawn
from
out
their
lore
of
age
when
shall
earth
begin
to
burn
with
such
love
as
thrills
my
breast
when
shall
we
together
turn
to
our
long
long
home
for
rest
child
and
father
we
grow
old
while
you
laugh
and
play
with
flowers
and
life
tale
for
us
is
told
holding
only
empty
hours
giant
child
on
you
await
all
the
hopes
and
fears
of
men
in
thy
fulness
is
our
fate
what
till
then
oh
what
till
then
the
joy
of
earth
oh
the
sudden
wings
arising
from
the
ploughed
fields
brown
showered
aloft
in
spray
of
song
the
wildbird
twitter
floats
the
unseen
fount
awhile
and
then
comes
dropping
down
nigh
the
cool
brown
earth
to
hush
enraptured
notes
far
within
a
dome
of
trembling
opal
throbs
the
fire
mistily
its
rain
of
diamond
lances
shed
below
touches
eyes
and
brows
and
faces
lit
with
wild
desire
for
the
burning
silence
whither
we
would
go
heart
o
heart
once
more
it
is
the
ancient
joy
of
earth
breathes
in
thee
and
flings
the
wild
wings
sunward
to
the
dome
to
the
light
where
all
the
children
of
the
fire
had
birth
though
our
hearts
and
footsteps
wander
far
from
home
reconciliation
i
begin
through
the
grass
once
again
to
be
bound
to
the
lord
i
can
see
through
a
face
that
has
faded
the
face
full
of
rest
of
the
earth
of
the
mother
my
heart
with
her
heart
in
accord
as
i
lie
the
cool
green
tresses
that
mantle
her
breast
i
begin
with
the
grass
once
again
to
be
bound
to
the
lord
by
the
hand
of
a
child
i
am
led
to
the
throne
of
the
king
for
a
touch
that
now
fevers
me
not
is
forgotten
and
far
and
his
infinite
sceptred
hands
that
sway
us
can
bring
me
in
dreams
from
the
laugh
of
a
child
to
the
song
of
a
star
on
the
laugh
of
a
child
i
am
borne
to
the
joy
of
the
king
sweetest
song
was
ever
sung
may
soothe
you
but
a
little
while
the
gayest
music
ever
rung
shall
yield
you
but
a
fleeting
well
i
digged
you
soon
shall
pass
you
may
but
rest
with
me
an
hour
yet
drink
i
offer
you
the
glass
a
moment
of
sustaining
power
give
to
you
if
it
be
gain
whether
in
pleasure
or
annoy
to
see
one
elemental
pain
one
light
of
everlasting
note
as
the
mythological
references
made
in
a
few
poems
may
partially
obscure
the
meaning
for
those
unacquainted
with
celtic
tradition
i
have
appended
here
a
brief
commentary
on
the
names
mentioned
the
celtic
eros
in
the
bardic
stories
he
is
described
as
a
tall
youth
playing
on
a
harp
and
surrounded
by
singing
birds
the
kisses
of
these
birds
created
love
and
also
brought
death
the
prince
of
the
dark
powers
his
eye
turned
every
living
thing
it
rested
on
into
stone
he
was
killed
at
the
battle
of
moytura
by
lugh
the
the
hibernian
mother
of
the
gods
who
were
named
from
her
tuatha
de
danaan
or
the
tribes
of
the
goddess
dana
they
are
also
sometimes
called
the
sidhe

children

were
changed
into
swans
by
magic
and
who
lived
for
long
ages
on
the
waters
around
the
irish
coast
the
story
of
the
fate
of
the
children
of
lir
was
probably
in
its
earliest
form
a
mythological
account
of
the
descent
of
the
spirit
from
the
to
the
earth
and
its
final
redemption
the
great
god
of
light
who
led
the
de

who
slew

a
cast
from
his

is
a
celtic
hermes
or
apollo

dark
powers
who
were
opposed
to
the
hosts
of

enslaved
the

for
a
time
until
the
de
danaans
rose

by
