ioläus
the
man
that
was
a
ghost
gold
light
across
the
golden
coomb
the
sun
went
west
with
horns
of
fire
athwart
the
sweet
room
the
swallows
swooped
the
village
spire
glowed
red
against
a
gleam
of
broom
while
earth
its
scented
secrets
told
there
silent
sat
ioläus
mild
and
old
in
distance
large
the
moving
ships
sailed
on
into
the
evening
skies
he
gazed
and
saw
not
in
eclipse
he
tensely
sat
like
one
who
grips
some
semblance
that
his
dream
descries
with
such
a
look
of
far
surprise
that
seemed
the
man
so
warped
with
age
so
weirdly
wan
he
had
such
ghostly
eyes
then
half
to
self
and
half
to
me
aloof
in
passion
and
lone
despair
he
spoke
like
one
whose
secrets
flee
from
silence
unaware
now
plaintively
from
a
grief
gone
blind
heavy
with
cumbering
care
now
thrilling
thought
like
a
white
his
words
the
echoes
of
his
mind
haunted
the
air
is
gone
like
the
roses
of
long
ago
yet
a
dawn
impassioned
thrill
makes
blush
the
blossom
virgin
snow
far
on
in
a
faery
hill
two
faces
there
in
the
glamour
glow
in
a
place
that
is
strangely
still
on
the
rim
of
the
world
is
a
ruined
tower
above
wide
where
a
beautiful
spirit
waits
hour
by
hour
a
dawn
like
a
phantom
flower
till
a
ghostly
lover
comes
home
to
leeward
spread
the
freshening
deep
purple
beneath
a
rosy
gleam
from
a
high
steep
thin
anthems
to
the
orient
beam
came
faint
as
languid
waves
of
sleep
that
lap
the
lonely
strands
of
dream
we
sank
our
anchor
solemnly
into
that
lustrous
splendid
sea
for
we
that
chased
the
summer
smile
across
the
world
a
wondering
while
hailed
at
the
heart
the
happy
isle
the
haunted
shores
of
faëry
beyond
a
brine
we
broke
with
oars
a
trembling
bay
the
swerving
water
like
rare
wine
slid
iridescent
from
our
way
a
lovely
hand
was
laid
on
mine
pensively
as
to
say
life
is
divine
the
drifting
witching
wonder
grew
from
out
the
burgeoning
bounds
of
space
it
seemed
some
morn
unearthly
drew
to
that
grave
glamourous
place
where
fearful
of
some
far
adieu
i
talked
with
one
who
never
knew
the
peril
of
her
face
the
joy
that
lives
is
mightier
far
than
foretaste
of
all
grief
unborn
the
earth
to
youth
is
a
silver
star
that
glitters
on
the
edge
of
morn
a
star
a
star
a
dancing
star
the
fair
the
mystic
happy
morn
dawn
glimmered
on
the
gladdening
sea
each
zephyr
blew
an
elfin
horn
to
echoes
in
felicity
all
sounds
to
silver
rhythm
ran
came
flutings
as
from
piping
pan
in
purpled
hills
of
arcady
seaward
we
heard
the
breakers
roar
and
the
belated
nightingales
sang
all
their
moonlight
raptures
enchanted
still
in
echoing
vales
we
lingered
by
the
brightening
shore
we
leapt
upon
the
roseate
strand
the
joy
that
in
our
hearts
we
bore
we
loved
nor
longed
to
understand
soft
siren
voices
evermore
chanted
to
chimes
in
faeryland
o
life
was
like
a
bird
that
sings
at
morning
on
a
vernal
bough
the
springtide
at
the
heart
of
things
sang
as
the
spring
knows
how
and
fair
was
she
and
both
were
young
we
knew
not
what
made
time
so
good
nature
with
tongue
spread
glory
in
the
blood
we
climbed
the
dim
and
dreaming
streets
we
reached
a
plateau
crowned
with
pine
the
leaning
roses
breathed
their
sweets
many
a
vine
we
wreathed
our
brows
with
in
mouldering
majesty
sublime
misty
with
eld
the
mute
of
time
a
castle
there
above
th
abyss
sheer
shimmering
fair
hung
like
a
perilous
dream
in
air
poised
on
a
dizzy
turret
high
enfolded
with
the
gorgeous
sky
we
listened
she
and
i
in
wonder
without
a
word
a
soul
had
spoken
soul
had
heard
all
suddenly
came
charged
with
tears
the
sweetness
of
the
human
years
we
saw
deep
forests
far
away
kindle
to
meet
the
kiss
of
day
and
mists
with
morn
delight
uprise
like
love
thoughts
in
a
maiden
eyes
we
shared
the
dream
that
never
dies
our
hearts
were
hushed
with
vague
desire
we
breathed
in
kingdoms
wildly
new
enthralled
by
memnon
mystic
lyre
in
regions
whence
the
ph
oe
nix
flew
dumb
splendour
round
us
blown
and
higher
on
heaven
deep
dome
the
peacock
hue
bright
flakes
of
crimsoning
fire
was
all
the
wavering
air
we
heard
the
reef
far
rollers
croon
about
the
ocean
margent
where
loitered
the
waning
moon
so
fond
the
hour
the
scene
so
fair
and
fate
came
home
so
soon
some
sorrow
wept
i
knew
not
where
some
sudden
presence
made
the
air
chill
as
the
breathless
moon
silent
upon
a
lonelier
steep
i
gazed
across
a
deeper
deep
where
the
pale
mists
pass
from
the
isles
of
lost
voices
called
in
other
years
old
sweetness
like
a
breaking
grief
rose
in
the
heart
and
stung
to
tears
in
that
clear
moment
brief
life
dearest
dead
so
long
before
returned
to
bless
and
die
once
more
the
faintly
crooning
sabbath
bells
at
evening
in
the
golden
fells
i
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
rills
in
haunts
where
childish
fancy
fed
i
saw
the
orchard
daffodils
about
the
calm
homestead
ah
saddest
thought
that
ever
fills
an
errant
heart
that
memory
thrills
the
of
his
homeland
hills
to
one
whose
loves
are
dead
what
yearnings
burn
the
human
breast
what
wild
desires
like
prisoned
birds
impel
the
heart
from
east
to
west
what
urgings
baffling
words
beat
up
from
nature
unexpressed
till
soul
distinct
stands
manifest
on
guard
for
heaven
or
wanton
hurled
toward
judgment
through
the
world
long
following
beauty
floating
flame
beneath
the
sky
from
sea
to
sea
no
isle
of
rest
no
haven
could
claim
the
lonely
homeless
heart
in
me
sick
loneliness
no
more
should
be
companion
to
my
soul
for
she
to
fill
the
questing
vision
came
came
down
the
breadths
of
blossoming
foam
to
give
to
loveliness
a
name
to
happiness
a
home
yet
thought
toward
passion
moved
with
dread
like
one
who
hurrying
to
be
wed
steps
darkling
on
the
dead
far
down
we
saw
mute
wavelets
leap
feebly
as
though
remembering
sleep
the
wheeling
proudly
sway
in
glory
the
opal
bay
but
at
the
heart
the
world
grew
grey
some
joy
had
perished
from
the
day
some
love
was
grieving
far
away
no
voice
stirred
through
the
haunted
hill
touched
with
the
morn
inviolate
gleam
all
fearfully
wild
heart
and
will
drank
rapture
in
the
face
of
ill
our
spirits
thrilled
to
answer
thrill
and
trembled
in
their
dream
truth
comes
and
tears
and
glamour
goes
there
speech
within
the
blood
more
eloquent
than
language
knows
and
woes
make
signal
unto
woes
while
pity
breathes
and
passion
blows
we
looked
we
understood
on
summer
heart
fell
winter
snows
the
death
that
dissipates
the
rose
was
busy
in
the
bud
the
spectre
beckoned
none
could
save
the
sundering
grave
the
sundering
grave
our
lonely
love
in
time
could
be
but
whisper
of
a
broken
wave
lost
in
a
boundless
sea
she
spoke
so
fair
so
pale
so
brave
across
infinity
ah
meekness
mute
with
tragedy
my
body
stirred
as
in
a
grave
and
looked
forth
wonderingly
the
everlasting
sea
serene
everlasting
sky
shone
and
across
the
morning
sheen
the
deathless
winds
went
by
and
a
face
was
there
that
i
never
had
seen
and
a
shadow
stood
where
a
glory
had
been
the
beauty
hung
at
my
heart
like
pain
and
love
was
lovely
but
life
was
bane
for
all
should
die
but
the
wonder
remain
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
the
sky
the
hills
have
winds
the
fields
have
flowers
not
all
alone
is
the
wintry
tree
the
stars
that
gleam
in
cloudy
bowers
have
stars
for
company
the
waste
hath
peace
of
the
drifting
hours
and
night
brings
joy
to
the
hoary
sea
but
the
heart
of
man
is
a
lonely
thing
and
lone
the
soul
of
the
secret
vows
with
its
wasted
love
and
its
wounded
wing
in
a
withered
world
that
hath
no
spring
no
burgeoning
boughs
the
soul
of
man
is
the
loneliest
thing
in
life
eternal
wandering
that
god
allows
o
isle
of
dreams
and
orient
shore
ah
miracle
in
sea
and
sky
ah
youth
that
fleeting
love
made
soar
to
heaven
the
glory
upon
high
to
dusk
hath
waned
yet
comes
once
more
a
wonder
and
a
cry
the
ship
bell
tolled
off
that
fair
land
the
sails
bulged
buoyantly
the
sun
rose
mute
and
large
and
bland
the
favouring
wind
swung
free
we
stood
from
that
enchanted
strand
into
the
morning
sea
we
rode
down
swinging
winds
away
far
the
moving
waters
wan
seen
low
at
pale
meridan
the
land
was
grey
the
dusk
came
down
and
like
a
ghost
rose
the
sad
moon
the
waves
moan
there
on
the
deep
no
kindly
coast
the
dark
alone
and
in
two
faces
stared
and
stared
the
being
without
blood
or
breath
the
stilly
spectre
that
haunteth
all
he
murdereth
at
noon
at
midnight
stared
and
stared
when
sunrise
flashed
when
sunset
flared
the
grizzly
phantom
stalking
frail
beauty
to
her
grave
i
saw
him
moving
evermore
a
stealthy
wanderer
on
the
wave
a
shrouded
shadow
on
the
shore
the
worm
his
bondsman
and
the
brave
his
victims
evermore
the
power
that
drives
all
mortal
things
upbuoys
all
being
wanderings
moved
in
the
void
his
urgent
wings
on
down
the
weltering
world
we
sped
across
the
lonely
drifting
noon
along
the
wreathëd
tides
we
fled
beneath
the
memoried
moon
sad
love
pursued
where
sorrow
led
and
beauty
waiting
to
be
dead
kissed
under
the
dead
moon
love
speechless
yearned
in
hopeless
eyes
and
hearts
that
hungered
craved
in
vain
dumb
pity
heard
sad
pity
sighs
and
grief
soothed
grief
again
fond
smile
to
smile
sent
faint
replies
and
faded
back
to
pain
entangled
in
the
toils
of
fate
two
stood
at
eden
open
gate
banned
in
a
world
found
desolate
and
love
made
league
with
hate
all
time
long
woe
since
man
wet
eyes
peered
toward
a
promised
paradise
pressed
home
the
weight
of
smothered
cries
dead
dreams
and
hopeless
pain
of
souls
in
silence
slain
we
saw
the
loathsome
waste
of
death
sad
soul
at
war
with
sense
and
suffering
doomed
to
lingering
breath
and
slandered
innocence
and
beauty
ravished
at
the
bloom
saw
strength
flung
prostrate
fall
the
brave
from
the
womb
white
truth
made
criminal
impotent
passionate
counting
all
we
kissed
across
a
tomb
the
lustrous
clouds
trailed
proudly
by
and
through
a
rift
of
dazzling
sky
i
cursed
god
with
a
dreary
cry
the
silence
of
the
starry
night
the
silver
of
the
moonlit
sea
and
loud
in
secret
stern
and
trite
the
pulse
of
destiny
ah
sadness
scourged
with
doomed
delight
ah
wondrous
misery
pale
topsails
in
the
offing
shone
and
faded
into
foam
and
down
the
noontide
one
by
one
the
pale
proud
ships
would
roam
each
sailor
to
his
love
went
on
each
wanderer
to
his
home
and
ceasing
not
death
nearing
knell
tolled
in
a
heart
that
dreamed
no
more
our
lips
shook
sad
as
lips
in
hell
but
fearful
of
the
rending
shore
to
fill
all
time
with
sad
farewell
we
would
have
sailed
for
evermore
for
pleasantly
a
song
she
croon
and
feign
the
world
a
kindly
place
and
tender
was
the
haunting
tune
to
match
her
haunting
grace
and
tenderly
the
witching
moon
toyed
with
her
feeling
face
our
love
was
like
the
scent
of
flowers
to
her
who
watches
by
the
bed
of
one
that
dies
in
the
dark
hours
the
one
her
youth
had
wed
at
dawn
she
scares
her
tears
away
and
through
the
day
jests
bravely
for
their
bread
she
shared
with
all
the
brighter
part
the
witching
sallies
lightly
flew
her
thoughts
seemed
spilt
by
subtle
art
half
and
half
dew
they
loved
her
for
her
gracious
heart
and
the
glad
winds
blew
the
sunbeam
of
her
fleeting
life
gladdened
the
unsuspecting
days
and
all
the
dusky
imps
of
strife
paled
in
her
wisdom
lambent
rays
her
laugh
to
was
as
a
knife
but
she
had
pleasure
praise
and
i
who
loved
that
conquering
smile
and
felt
the
tears
in
secret
shed
who
watched
her
life
with
kindly
guile
veiling
its
darlings
dead
held
in
a
choking
hush
the
while
a
heart
that
feigned
and
bled
onward
with
blind
rebellious
breast
i
ranged
with
love
with
bale
opprest
piteous
passionate
all
unblest
the
dispossessëd
more
lonely
grew
the
leaden
wave
that
broke
against
the
leaning
sky
the
melancholy
winds
rave
among
the
whimpering
shrouds
on
high
most
lonely
up
the
leaden
wave
two
climbed
toward
yet
a
lonelier
grave
where
only
one
should
lie
we
neared
a
grey
and
grievous
land
that
thundered
by
a
wintry
sea
i
touched
the
sorrow
of
her
hand
but
nothing
sad
said
she
she
turned
from
love
at
death
command
to
death
eternally
we
passed
the
numbly
moaning
bar
we
heard
the
harbour
bell
its
dull
clang
from
far
came
like
a
lorn
the
pushed
a
livid
flare
through
shrouding
mist
and
all
things
there
moved
like
grim
shades
in
hell
the
hammer
clamp
on
resonant
steel
the
siren
shriek
the
scream
and
whirr
reverberant
from
forge
and
wheel
the
fury
and
the
clangorous
stir
and
plunge
of
traffic
vulcan
heel
crashing
on
iron
and
the
reel
of
sense
at
loss
of
none
guessed
when
playfully
she
said
with
smile
that
brightened
toward
her
dead
across
the
world
i
ride
to
meet
a
bridegroom
i
the
bride
they
thought
her
mischief
lied
around
us
was
the
deafening
roar
a
void
a
wild
and
drear
eclipse
a
sadder
sweetness
than
before
shook
her
pale
smiling
lips
she
waved
adieu
through
vapours
hoar
and
vanished
in
the
shadows
frore
among
the
heedless
ships
in
that
dread
lapse
of
all
farewell
the
spirit
listening
plain
could
tell
that
devils
laughed
in
drifting
hell
with
guile
upon
their
lips
the
world
seemed
all
a
hollow
ghost
that
would
dissolve
away
and
life
itself
a
random
boast
of
elements
at
play
and
time
a
swift
elusive
gleam
and
man
the
mockery
of
a
dream
a
to
a
moment
beam
flung
from
the
spray
i
had
worshipped
her
with
sacred
sighs
loved
with
the
love
that
wondereth
my
life
had
found
her
and
sweeter
than
the
rose
breath
lit
by
a
soul
in
paradise
the
lights
within
her
holy
eyes
the
lady
loved
of
death
bereft
forlorn
by
passion
driven
and
blanched
with
loss
by
suffering
riven
with
impious
heart
i
fled
from
heaven
thought
like
a
frost
gripped
all
the
brain
with
frozen
tears
opprest
the
conscious
blood
with
sullen
pain
lunged
at
the
callous
breast
where
hope
and
love
a
pallid
twain
sat
with
a
ghoul
for
guest
over
the
watery
wastes
i
fled
dim
desolation
led
beneath
sad
sun
and
moon
for
faith
was
dead
and
joy
was
dead
and
love
was
where
the
phantoms
tread
and
bitterness
was
passion
bread
grant
jester
death
i
laughing
said
thy
haggard
fool
a
boon
and
unforgiving
unforgiven
a
derelict
by
tempest
driven
i
drave
beneath
the
breadth
of
heaven
grim
sorrow
fell
on
all
things
fair
to
dust
was
turned
the
lover
breath
ah
longing
like
a
pariah
bare
and
passion
led
by
lewd
despair
to
kiss
the
smelling
jowl
of
death
as
in
a
sunless
cavern
cold
like
one
who
flies
a
crime
fearful
and
old
as
god
is
old
the
spirit
shrank
from
time
for
a
stifled
scream
was
the
angry
gold
of
the
weird
sunset
and
the
noonday
bold
was
the
stare
on
the
face
of
a
crime
i
saw
as
drunkards
see
i
felt
yet
could
not
feel
i
seemed
in
moving
time
to
be
in
nerveless
immobility
as
dust
upon
a
wheel
some
world
material
moved
around
mazed
breadths
of
spume
and
brine
strange
voices
spake
as
from
a
bound
far
off
i
answered
with
a
sound
nor
knew
the
answer
mine
and
sometimes
like
a
weary
hound
i
heard
the
darkness
whine
in
throbbing
night
sleep
and
sleep
my
tortured
spirit
heard
a
wail
that
wandered
down
the
deep
a
sorrow
on
the
windy
deep
wail
like
a
wounded
bird
and
i
wept
as
a
haunted
man
doth
weep
who
dare
not
speak
a
word
sometimes
i
sensed
heaven
bellied
gloom
storm
like
dumb
and
pregnant
doom
scowl
on
the
waters
wild
or
tempest
a
plunging
sky
down
crashing
waves
with
haunting
cry
scream
like
a
tortured
child
a
blind
thing
staggering
in
the
night
strained
groaning
a
pervious
power
that
flashed
and
eddied
wild
and
white
that
wheeled
and
wailed
from
hour
to
hour
and
somewhere
strangely
burned
to
sight
dawn
like
a
doom
on
ever
onward
darkly
driven
a
soul
unsheltered
and
unshriven
with
lodestar
gone
with
raiment
riven
drove
in
the
gale
of
the
wrath
of
heaven
the
monsoon
blew
the
changing
stars
rode
by
in
deeper
skies
at
times
between
the
raking
spars
i
felt
the
blank
moon
rise
or
heard
the
chanties
of
the
tars
with
a
sad
sick
surprise
and
once
a
heaven
the
sapphire
hue
flashed
the
freshening
wave
they
hurt
the
heart
as
laughers
do
when
love
stands
by
a
grave
and
now
a
level
ocean
grey
would
lie
along
a
level
day
unwhipt
of
wing
or
wind
or
sunset
make
a
carmine
stain
that
sucked
like
sadness
at
the
brain
and
sank
into
the
mind
and
touched
me
with
some
wandering
pain
some
sentience
of
mankind
again
and
where
was
could
sorrow
fail
in
aching
time
ah
voice
in
vain
that
called
for
ever
fading
sail
on
seas
forlorn
sad
wind
and
rain
whispering
pain
and
in
the
heart
the
wail
never
again
on
earth
never
again
so
dimly
to
a
beauteous
ghost
my
being
bowed
a
subject
knee
and
lived
with
love
sad
sunset
lost
alone
all
the
sea
a
leper
to
a
lonely
coast
i
fled
from
all
i
cherished
most
and
wildly
with
a
bleeding
boast
i
clasped
my
agony
sad
nature
strained
the
leash
in
vain
and
flying
fled
not
ever
the
chain
of
the
fear
that
followed
ever
again
relentless
pity
guardian
pain
like
torturing
dreams
the
days
went
by
with
all
save
self
denied
and
godward
went
man
desolate
cry
that
christ
himself
had
cried
alone
each
soul
upon
its
tree
cried
to
its
kin
but
over
me
the
darkness
that
crushed
calvary
when
god
was
crucified
the
present
lost
i
found
aghast
a
dying
heart
a
deathless
past
and
ever
nigh
and
mocking
me
a
madness
or
a
mystery
and
hour
by
hour
in
peril
passed
a
soul
toward
judgment
through
the
vast
life
a
vague
tumult
in
the
blood
beat
on
flesh
and
bone
and
in
its
echoing
solitude
the
heart
tapped
like
a
stone
till
like
some
child
at
dark
i
stood
that
stands
in
a
wood
alone
yet
not
for
mine
was
ghostly
company
chilled
in
the
eerie
air
i
felt
bend
over
me
and
point
as
with
despair
and
i
turned
to
see
my
body
selfless
there
and
separate
a
house
of
clay
that
mourned
its
tenant
gone
its
vacant
eyes
would
fain
delay
its
piteous
hands
implored
to
stay
the
soul
that
in
it
shone
where
one
had
been
in
mute
dismay
two
merged
in
mystery
went
away
i
and
that
other
one
with
vision
blurred
and
bearings
lost
streamed
on
amid
a
phantom
host
the
man
that
was
a
ghost
apart
from
human
years
i
stood
a
naked
probing
mind
aloof
i
heard
the
beating
blood
the
voices
of
the
blood
flow
round
me
like
a
wind
in
an
abysmal
solitude
i
staggered
like
one
in
wastes
uncharted
far
from
bliss
i
heard
a
writhing
chaos
hiss
and
thought
that
moved
in
time
no
more
wept
on
some
wild
appalled
the
boundless
vision
burst
through
yawning
gulfs
of
gloom
to
human
hunger
human
thirst
infinite
hell
did
loom
infinite
bale
to
vision
burst
in
tracts
of
nebulous
bloom
and
life
through
peril
lorn
accurst
passed
on
from
doom
to
doom
the
depths
were
full
of
throes
unknown
weird
wastes
of
vomited
fire
wild
mists
of
thunderous
flame
were
blown
athwart
eclipse
i
heard
the
groan
of
travailing
worlds
stupendous
thrown
through
chaos
to
expire
my
spirit
cowed
with
vastness
dire
gazed
poised
in
space
alone
alone
as
a
haunted
life
that
lies
on
the
when
a
dread
past
cries
and
the
live
dark
burns
with
eternal
eyes
rang
from
shrivelled
pride
oh
loneliest
of
the
dead
thou
with
the
deeply
riven
side
and
with
the
branded
head
lo
i
in
blasphemy
that
died
do
envy
all
the
dead
and
fleeing
fain
would
die
but
this
can
never
be
this
mortal
nevermore
can
lie
to
oh
hearken
to
my
ghostly
cry
lone
ghost
of
calvary
i
was
my
own
infinity
the
cry
the
echo
i
oh
brother
with
the
breast
brother
in
hope
in
shame
in
joy
in
sorrow
east
and
west
we
know
but
man
earth
awful
guest
is
vastness
with
a
name
is
spirit
hungry
in
the
quest
of
spirit
whence
he
came
on
through
the
void
i
shuddering
fled
immortal
seeking
to
be
dead
with
god
behind
me
god
ahead
pursued
encompassed
lost
and
led
god
outcasts
only
have
their
ease
but
i
was
not
as
these
from
deep
to
deep
my
soul
was
blown
like
sin
toward
judgment
ever
alone
with
the
eye
unseen
and
the
hand
unknown
sad
nature
strained
the
leash
in
vain
and
flying
fled
not
ever
the
chain
of
the
fear
that
followed
ever
again
relentless
pity
guardian
pain
slow
time
a
sad
nepenthe
brought
numb
poignance
with
no
sigh
when
body
dim
with
sorrow
sought
day
with
a
dead
man
as
from
far
off
i
darkly
saw
i
lay
as
doomed
men
lie
a
lamb
beneath
a
lion
paw
that
lamb
was
i
my
soul
i
felt
the
monster
gnaw
i
heard
my
body
die
and
dumbly
a
dreader
deep
i
drifted
as
on
awful
sleep
where
sorrows
burn
and
never
weep
delirium
reigned
fell
darkness
dire
vague
terror
shapeless
dole
forever
climbing
ghâts
of
fire
i
struggled
to
a
goal
where
lone
upon
the
suttee
pyre
i
saw
my
life
desire
the
widow
of
my
soul
far
and
far
through
light
i
saw
her
beckoning
stand
anon
like
a
burning
bird
in
fright
she
fled
with
a
shriek
through
the
lurid
night
and
i
wailed
like
a
lost
soul
banned
and
an
echo
flew
like
an
anguished
sprite
and
wailed
in
a
hollow
land
then
utter
loss
and
there
was
nought
my
sentience
wholly
sped
no
sound
no
feeling
sight
or
thought
yet
i
knew
with
a
vacuous
dread
i
lay
a
thing
by
god
unsought
dead
dead
for
ever
dead
slow
ages
seemed
to
have
their
will
and
moving
toward
the
prime
th
eternal
immanency
still
breathed
in
the
senseless
lime
till
a
dead
thing
felt
the
procreant
thrill
and
shuddered
back
to
time
it
might
have
been
ten
thousand
years
that
over
me
had
run
it
might
have
been
ten
thousand
years
i
had
not
sensed
the
oh
god
how
much
of
sin
that
sears
how
many
many
bitter
years
till
soul
from
dust
be
won
oh
lord
of
light
make
sweet
their
tears
who
never
see
the
sun
mean
as
the
dust
through
the
volant
vast
flung
like
chaff
as
ashes
cast
to
the
nether
storms
i
sank
pride
past
on
the
waiting
wings
of
the
first
and
last
slowly
slowly
came
the
grey
where
all
was
dark
before
some
monster
left
its
mangled
prey
because
the
night
was
and
sick
beside
an
indian
shore
i
knew
that
it
was
day
and
strangely
cared
some
cloudy
pain
seemed
from
my
being
rolled
afar
upon
a
misty
plain
the
grey
was
turning
gold
i
slept
and
dreamt
of
rustling
rain
on
leaves
in
summers
old
and
faintly
in
my
dream
the
corn
shook
under
english
skies
to
wreathe
with
silvery
song
the
morn
i
saw
the
laverock
rise
and
i
saw
the
dead
by
a
thorn
touched
with
the
blush
of
a
mounting
morn
singing
in
paradise
and
a
seraph
blew
on
a
golden
horn
and
i
saw
with
a
mild
surmise
white
shapes
pass
panoplied
from
war
in
fields
to
sense
unknown
and
over
them
a
star
blazed
in
its
heaven
alone
and
a
chant
of
joy
was
blown
afar
and
a
rang
that
blinding
star
which
deep
in
a
world
crepuscular
my
spirit
knew
for
its
own
then
i
turned
for
the
dazzled
my
eyes
and
woke
with
a
glad
surprise
woke
with
the
on
my
face
the
sunbeams
filtered
through
a
tamarind
in
a
stilly
place
i
saw
the
brazen
blue
and
suddenly
christ
healing
grace
fell
round
like
holy
dew
and
kindly
faces
passed
and
smiled
and
gentle
voices
spoke
and
wondering
like
a
waking
child
the
night
within
me
broke
and
from
a
heart
grown
reconciled
went
heavenward
like
thin
smoke
on
all
the
bounds
of
ranging
sight
the
lifting
gloom
was
riven
the
terrors
of
abysmal
night
fled
like
hushed
horrors
fly
from
light
by
dawn
winged
horsemen
driven
on
the
drifting
hills
of
morn
shone
bright
the
gonfalons
of
heaven
warm
winds
from
pleasances
came
through
the
lattice
bars
with
scents
and
murmurous
harmonies
like
splintered
scimitars
the
moonbeams
through
the
banyan
trees
gleamed
under
indian
stars
and
far
away
and
far
away
my
heart
went
out
forlorn
benizons
from
far
away
i
felt
my
soul
reborn
and
man
from
every
bay
and
mountain
town
where
sunsets
stay
from
sounding
cities
smoking
grey
called
called
me
down
the
morn
o
magic
of
the
morning
sky
o
wonder
of
the
moonlit
sea
o
life
the
vision
and
the
cry
into
eternity
eternity
beneath
on
high
veiled
within
cloud
and
clod
that
life
in
folly
would
vainly
fly
through
the
nethermost
deep
through
the
uttermost
high
life
that
is
never
to
die
to
the
agony
of
god
too
long
to
self
my
life
had
given
what
was
for
soul
alone
to
rob
the
sanctuaries
had
striven
to
build
a
lone
love
throne
in
vain
we
prop
each
little
heaven
while
men
souls
turn
to
stone
the
good
in
ill
let
no
man
scorn
the
ill
in
good
let
all
men
find
our
knowledge
is
the
lesser
morn
large
night
with
stars
behind
shews
most
of
spirit
still
is
born
all
life
all
wonder
it
shall
bind
all
hearts
in
wisdom
unforlorn
he
lives
in
deserts
though
he
mourn
who
loveth
all
the
kind
with
storm
gone
by
from
jeopardy
with
loss
for
gain
and
blindness
past
home
to
divine
reality
the
tides
have
borne
me
home
at
last
time
like
a
silver
flower
doth
blow
and
blossom
a
subtler
sod
and
through
the
meads
of
light
i
go
beneath
the
golden
boughs
of
god
my
soul
hath
won
to
the
city
of
love
with
the
burnished
walls
of
the
dreams
desires
and
my
life
is
glad
as
a
glittering
dove
that
coos
in
the
sun
upon
golden
spires
and
i
welcome
the
winds
of
the
world
and
move
to
the
music
of
unseen
choirs
great
powers
are
for
us
mighty
wings
toward
man
proud
peril
speed
life
nourished
at
eternal
springs
beats
up
through
star
and
creed
till
soul
ascendant
a
soaring
seraph
sings
on
the
rim
of
the
world
is
a
rosy
tower
above
wide
where
a
beautiful
spirit
waits
hour
by
hour
a
dawn
like
a
phantom
flower
till
a
ghostly
lover
comes
home
ah
love
is
as
lust
till
it
count
love
lost
the
soul
is
as
sin
till
it
weep
sin
cost
o
happy
is
he
though
he
suffer
most
who
wins
to
the
holy
ghost
so
spake
old
ioläus
there
that
drifting
monody
its
eerie
passion
weird
despair
had
wrought
on
me
like
wizardry
withál
he
moved
through
strange
eclipse
with
god
faint
finger
at
his
lips
and
with
such
tense
and
far
surprise
that
half
uncanny
seemed
the
man
with
cloudy
hair
in
human
guise
so
warped
with
age
so
weirdly
wan
whose
dry
flesh
into
spirit
ran
and
saw
with
ghostly
eyes
the
return
to
home
o
most
pale
adventurer
are
you
bound
from
that
strange
kingdom
where
no
love
may
trace
the
life
it
loves
to
its
abiding
place
or
hail
it
from
afar
with
cheerful
sound
from
deeps
whose
marges
mortal
hath
found
you
steal
and
we
are
awed
before
your
face
for
you
are
weird
with
wonder
with
the
grace
of
death
most
delicate
lilies
are
you
crowned
after
the
ranging
sunset
of
farewell
when
life
loved
country
fades
and
hope
is
lorn
is
it
not
fair
from
that
dim
tideless
bourn
to
drift
back
home
to
man
own
star
and
dwell
fondly
with
time
in
tune
with
bud
and
bell
with
midnight
shimmer
of
stars
and
the
sheen
of
morn
the
soul
and
the
sea
i
hear
the
shouting
of
th
exultant
sea
its
reel
and
crash
along
the
shuddering
strand
through
muffling
mist
the
wide
reverberant
land
in
thunderous
labour
laughs
exultantly
the
wrestling
wind
tumultuous
revelry
whips
into
whirling
clouds
the
blanched
the
primal
powers
in
grim
convulsion
grand
strive
straining
agonists
frenzied
to
be
free
and
in
the
lapses
of
the
roaring
gale
i
hear
the
cries
of
lives
that
rage
and
weep
that
sow
for
ever
and
that
never
reap
brave
hearts
that
travail
with
all
hopes
that
fail
break
with
the
breakers
with
a
wandering
wail
flies
sorrow
with
white
lips
along
the
deep
nations
estranged
the
voice
of
the
millions
bound
to
one
triumph
of
one
travail
born
doomed
to
one
death
in
one
brief
life
we
moil
the
pangs
that
maim
us
and
the
powers
that
spoil
are
common
sorrows
heired
from
worlds
outworn
alike
in
weakness
time
too
long
hath
torn
our
mother
patience
and
our
father
toil
brothers
in
hatred
of
the
fates
that
foil
say
not
in

we
murmur
and
we
mourn
o
by
the
love
that
lights
our
mothers
eyes
by
hearth
and
home
by
common
hopes
and
fears
by
all
sad
sweetness
of
the
human
years
partings
and
meetings
by
our
infants
cries
one
are
we
through
the
heart
divine
allies
in
long
allegiance
to
eternal
tears
the
an
impression
a
roaring
furnace
and
a
grim
vitreous
gloom
and
one
low
raking
gleam
from
a
spent
sun
that
spills
its
passive
beam
athwart
a
smouldering
city
comes
the
smell
of
sweat
and
labour
the
sad
sullen
knell
in
the
brain
as
in
a
baleful
dream
a
panting
siren
veiled
with
hissing
steam
shrieks
like
a
horror
deep
in
hell
a
flaccid
