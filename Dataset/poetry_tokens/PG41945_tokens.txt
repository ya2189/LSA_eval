with
i
can
build
a
castle
to
the
sky
no
one
can
shake
it
down
though
he
may
try
and
try
except
myself
and
then
i
make
another
one
and
shape
it
as
i
please
this
fun
nobody
takes
away
and
what
i
like
the
best
the
change
each
day
stupid
you
there
is
a
shining
thread
in
my
a
magic

the
fairies
have
outspread
to
catch
the
dewy

yet
you
said
it
was
a
cobweb

anagrams
when
i
played
anagrams
i
spelled
a
long
word
out
a
word
named
then
i
tried
to
change
it
all
about
to
make
it
spell
another
word
my
mother
said
there
is
a
way
to
make
the
spell
peace
i
tried
and
tried
almost
all
day
i
turned
the
letters
round
and
round
this
way
and
that
to
find
out
how
and
yet
i
can
not
find
the
way
and
supper
time
is
coming
now
doorsteps
i
take
my
broom
and
sweep
my
step
to
make
it
smooth
and
brown
then
i
sit
down
and
wait
with
jep
until
the
sun
goes
down
i
think
some
day
that
i
may
see
a
little
brownie
elf
peep
out
of
there
and
speak
to
me
when
i
am
by
myself
i
like
my
roses
at
the
side
much
better
than
the
along
your
path
where
people
ride
i
leave
my
roses
just
to
grow
i
like
the
place
that
broken
too
with
splintered
edges
all
around
and
grasses
growing
right
up
through
that
smell
so
fresh
like
dew
and
ground
your
steps
are
nice
but
then
my
own
seem
nicer
somehow
just
for
me
pine
steps
are
more
like
home
than
stone
for
once
they
lived
and
were
a
tree

and
the
big
clock
our
big
clock
goes
so
slow
when
i
am
waiting
on
the
stairs
with
nice
clean
clothes
on
dressed
to
go
out
with
aunt
beth
to
see
the
bears
and
funny
possums
at
the
zoo
but
oh
at
night
how
fast
our
big
clock
goes
it
very
rude
to
company
and
when
time
past
when
i
must
always
go
to
bed
the
hands
just
fly
in
wicked
glee
it
strikes
out
long
ahead
and
makes
them
all
look
round
at
me
illustration
copyright
by
duffield
and
the
new
dress
illustration
i
have
a
very
pretty
dress
it
made
of
pink
and
white
and
there
are
ribbons
on
it
too
which
make
it
bright
and
yet
i
think
i
like
it
less
than
this
dear
other
one
the
blue
i
wear
when
i
have
fun
it
clings
to
me
as
if
it
loved
to
have
me
wear
it
every
day
the
pink
stands
out
so
straight
and
stiff
it
in
my
way
how
can
i
get
to
know
it
well
when
it
so
perhaps
when
it
is
old
and
stained
with
dust
and
grass
it
will
not
seem
so
strange
and
dignified
as
now
but
then
i
think
i
never
make
mud
pies
right
if
i
had
on
my
pink
a
questioning
i
wonder
when
i
die
if
some
one
there
will
see
and
hold
me
close
and
take
good
care
of
me
as
when
i
came
on
earth
to
be
a
little
child
a
test
some
day
when
i
had
lots
to
eat
then
i
should
like
to
be
a
ragged
beggar
child
a
little
while
to
see
if
you
and
are
kind
a
quandary
when
they
are
tall
and
all
grown
up
i
wonder
where
the
children
go
i
wonder
how
one
finds
the
place
my
mother
says
she
does
know
the
little
boy
that
i
must
go
to
this
strange
some
day
when
i
outgrow
my
starchy
kilts
and
nursery
things
are
put
away
must
i
go
there
quite
by
myself
how
shall
i
find
the
proper
door
that
hides
so
close
and
shuts
away
the
little
children
gone
before

spring
music
i
heard
a
violin
one
day
it
sounded
like
the
spring
like
woolly
lambs
at
play
like
baby
birds
that
sing
in
snatches
when
they
learning
how
i
know
the
one
who
played
could
see
pink
blossoms
on
a
bough
where
children
came
beneath
its
shade
to
make
white
clover
in
a
crown
then
while
they
laughed
there
in
the
grass
soft
petals
fluttered
down
they
hushed
and
saw
some
angels
pass
with
friendly
eyes
that
smile
the
kind
that
i
have
often
seen
when
mother
sings
awhile
just
as
i
go
to
sleep
and
dream
i
held
my
breath
and
then
there
rose
the
last
sweet
note
so
high
i
felt
as
when
the
sunshine
goes
i
could
not
help
but
cry
a
compromise
when
i
have
done
a
something
wrong
i
feel
ashamed
to
kneel
and
pray
but
then
the
lasts
so
long
and
god
seems
oh
so
far
away
that
when
the
lights
are
out
awhile
i
clamber
out
of
bed
once
more
and
pour
my
pennies
in
a
pile
i
listen
at
the
door
and
then
i
get
upon
my
knees
and
whisper
just
for
god
to
hear
to
ask
him
oh
just
once
more
will
he
forgive
and
come
back
near
if
i
will
make
a
promise
to
give
my
pennies
to
the
sick
a
rainy
day
when
i
woke
up
and
saw
the
rain
in
blurs
upon
the
i
said
i
hated
such
a
day
because
i
could
run
and
play
out
in
the
sunshine
and
the
grass
it
queer
how
such
a
day
can
pass
so
soon
before
you
know
it
and
while
i
eat
my
milk
and
toast
before
i
go
to
bed
i
think
i
never
had
a
day
so
without
the
sun
to
make
the
shine
this
whole
day
long
has
been
just
mine
and
mother
in
the
fireplace
because
it
rained
it
made
it
so
illustration

and
an
appeal
to
science
i
wish
the
clever
men
who
made
the
whirly
things
with
patents
on
the
telephone
and
phonograph
the
watch
that
tells
how
far
you
gone
would
just
invent
some
bottled
sleep
that
we
could
take
at
night
and
then
again
when
it
grows
light
it
might
keep
little
boys
awake
when
there
is
company
all
i
should
have
to
do
would
be
to
pour
a
glass
of
sleep
to
take
the
things
i
leave
undone
because
i
have
time
enough
the
things
i
only
half
begun
my
my
ruff
i
get
quite
finished
in
a
day
i
have
some
time
left
over
too
i
have
the
chance
to
do
new
things
and
first
of
all
i
learn
to
play
the
games
the
flowers
frolic
through
each
afternoon
and
i
find
who
has
charge
of
yesterday
i
think
that
dreams
of
and
would
be
much
nicer
than
the
kind
which
on
dark
nights
i
always
find
the
runaway
there
something
that
is
calling
me
far
off
from
here
it
calls
for
me
to
come
and
see
away
from
near
sometimes
it
tinkles
like
a
bell
then
echo
songs
above
the
blue
and
sometimes
silver
whistles
tell
about
a
shining
dream
come
true
this
call
sings
low
of
it
tells
in
runs
and
trills
of
hidden
places
near
that
line
where
distance
smooths
the
little
hills
the
call
is
begging
me
to
come
it
makes
me
dance
and
sing
along
the
meadow
road
far
past
the
street
there
something
waiting
just
for
me
and
i
must
go
away
from
houses
here
to
see
where
lights
begin
to
glow
illustration
playmates
i
met
a
rabbit
in
the
path
who
stopped
and
looked
at
me
while
i
was
laughing
at
a
frog
hop
sidewise
from
a
bee
the
little
rabbit
eyes
laughed
too
he
would
have
like
to
stay
and
if
my
clothes
had
been
like
his
he
might
have
come
to
play
i
wish
i
had
a
rabbit
dress
a
furry
one
from
head
to
toe
then
i
could
go
away
with
him
from
streets
in
line
all
set
just
so
i
think
my
clothes
are
stupid
things
to
rob
me
of
my
friends
but
then
the
kind
of
playmate
clothes
i
want
nobody
lends
the
echo
i
laughed
in
woods
down
where
a
brook
ran
off
with
little
leaps
an
answer
came
from
some
and
then
another
made
me
look
off
in
the
dark
i
ran
to
all
the
nooks
to
see
if
i
could
find
the
one
who
heard
me
first
and
answered
me
each
place
was
still
as
it
could
be
as
far
as
i
could
run
nurse
said
there
no
one
to
be
caught
it
just
the
echo
glee
but
then
i
know
that
it
was
the
little
all
forgot
and
laughed
out
loud
with
me
the
sick
rose
this
rose
i
picked
began
to
die
and
so
i
brought
it
back
again
to
where
it
used
to
live
i
try
to
make
it
as
it
was
and
then
i
whisper
to
it
how
i
care
why
it
grow
now
any
more
a
rose
with
other
roses

upon

rosebush

afternoon
just
since
the
night
the
wind
has
won
the
last
pink
bud
to
open
bloom
the
long
path
whitens
in
the
sun
all
grown
folks
hunt
a
darkened
room
cool
sweet
of
morning
time
is
gone
from
all
the
leaves
and
grass
here
in
this
place
the
shade
falls
on
i
wait
for
butterflies
to
pass
the
wild
i
love
the
you
caught
for
me
but
from
its
song
is
gone
a
note
i
heard
when
it
was
free
and
when
i
bring
the
home
i
can
not
bring
the
too
the
spell
of
that
wee
gnome
which
makes
birds
sing
the
trees
you
painted
with
your
brush
are
like
the
real
but
that
still
harking
of
the
soft
you
could
not
steal
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
wold
the
same
that
part
of
me
the
gipsy
wild
of
me
without
a
name
unhoused
and
free
bud
music
i
know
when
little
buds
come
out
and
spread
their
colors
all
about
they
make
soft
music
yet
it
true
most
people
never
hear
do
you
there
is
the
faintest
tinkly
sound
birds
fly
to
listen
all
around
then
all
the
leaves
stand
just
as
still
and
sunshine
dances
on
the
hill
frills
the
dainty
frills
upon
my
frocks
make
me
all
twinkly
smiles
inside
i
want
to
take
my
sweets
around
a
something
in
me
says
divide
i
run
to
give
my
mother
dear
my
nicest
kiss
i
feed
the
sparrows
on
the
steps
and
think
what
others
miss
i
put
some
water
on
my
fern
to
every
one
i
want
to
say
nice
things
it
is
so
queer
that
we
can
dress
our
moods
away

and
gone
somewhere
illustration
one
day
a
little
boy
with
a
poor
broken
toy
and
ragged
clothes
went
by
he
looked
as
if
he
like
to
cry
to
see
my
soldiers
fine
in
scarlet
coats
so
straight
in
line
would
he
have
liked
to
play
with
me
here
beneath
my
shady
tree
i
wonder
but
i
did
not
call
him
back
again
i
thought
he
come
next
day
the
same
and
i
would
ask
him
in
to
play
and
when
he
had
to
go
away
give
him
my
nicest
toys
the
drum
that
makes
the
loudest
noise
my
whistle
and
perhaps
my
sword
or
even
my
soldier
hat
with
braids
and
cord
but
though
i
watch
here
by
the
gate
until
it
grows
quite
dark
and
late
i
never
hear
his
footsteps
there
the
little
boy
is
gone
somewhere
the
chosen
dream
if
i
could
choose
a
dream
i
choose
a
splendid
dream
about
big
soldiers
in
a
fight
so
real
that
it
would
seem
a
truly
one
not
in
a
book
with
flags
and
banners
waving
high
and
horses
with
a
prancing
look
and
powder
smoke
that
filled
the
sky
and
lots
of
swords
to
flash
perhaps
this
dream
would
frighten
me
more
than
a
noisy
game
if
too
much
blood
should
splash
and
any
soldiers
die
and
yet
i
think
i
choose
it
just
the
same
and
then
wake
up
and
cry
home
you
think
my
home
is
up
the
street
in
that
big
house
with
lots
of
steps
all
worn
in
places
by
our
feet
with
tracks
that
look
like
mine
and
jep
you
think
it
where
i
always
eat
where
i
can
find
my
spoon
and
bowl
my
napkin
folded
clean
and
neat
and
milk
and
sometimes
you
think
it
where
i
always
sleep
where
i
get
in
my
puffy
bed
and
fall
right
in
a
comfy
heap
some
nights
before
my
prayers
are
said
but
that
not
home
just
roof
and
walls
a
place
that
anybody
buys
with
shiny
floors
and
stairs
and
home
is
in
my
mother
eyes
illustration

duffield
and
dawn
there
are
no
sounds
of
feet
or
wagons
in
the
street
so
still
so
beautiful
with
air
so
fresh
and
cool
i
love
the
dawn
to
come
but
oh
i
know
that
some
are
not
so
glad
as
i
for
they
must
wake
to
cry
the
city
tree
a
solemn
city
tree
as
stiff
and
straight
as
it
can
be
all
cut
and
trimmed
and
kept
just
so
is
trying
very
hard
to
grow
correctly
with
its
top
so
queer
in
front
of
my
big
window
here
it
is
not
like
my
country
tree
good
friend
of
every
bird
and
bee
who
keep
it
merry
company
and
always
sing
and
talk
to
me
my
country
tree
laughs
all
day
long
its
fresh
leaves
whisper
in
a
song
their
secrets
just
for
me
to
hear
its
branches
lean
so
very
near
the
ground
that
grasses
stretch
and
try
to
meet
the
boughs
not
swung
too
high
there
is
the
place
the
very
best
in
all
the
world
to
play
and
rest
the
city
tree
stands
all
alone
above
the
pavement
stone
no
little
children
ever
stay
beneath
its
shade
to
play
they
are
brave
enough
to
dare
because
it
is
so
proper
there
there
are
no
about
no
crickets
frolic
in
and
out
the
city
tree
is
very
proud
it
has
even
looked
or
bowed
we
not
at
all
acquainted
yet
it
just
as
if
we
never
met
the
days
seem
long
i
wonder
when
i
see
my
country
tree
again
a
prayer
dear
god
may
i
dream
the
and
please
do
not
forget
to
make
it
light
on
time
again
for
me

cap
and
bells
they
make
me
laugh
and
clap
my
hands
when
they
run
out
in
wide
striped
clothes
of
white
with
red
and
yellow
bands
with
pointed
caps
and
pointed
toes
the
funny
men
at
circus
shows
i
wish
i
knew
just
how
a
clown
can
make
his
mouth
up
in
a
smile
and
wrinkle
in
a
crinkly
frown
his
forehead
all
the
while
in
that
queer
circus
style
illustration
one
day
when
i
had
cried
and
cried
because
i
lost
the
picture
book
which
i
had
made
and
mother
tried
to
comfort
me
we
went
and
took
a
walk
to
see
how
clown
men
look
i
soon
forgot
my
book
and
though
i
loved
it
just
the
same
i
could
cry
and
miss
it
so
and
think
about
each
picture
name
when
all
the
clown
men
came
illustration
i
think
we
ought
to
say
our
thanks
to
each
of
them
who
makes
and
sells
such
fun
and
jokes
such
jigs
and
pranks
how
dull
we
be
without
the
spells
they
make
with
cap
and
bells
summer
passing
my
mother
says
that
summer
gone
away
it
seems
so
queer
i
did
see
her
go
or
know
till
now
she
did
say
and
oh
i
loved
her
so
now
that
i
know
i
miss
her
all
the
time
i
found
this
piece
torn
from
her
gown
it
fluttered
softly
down
the
path
to
me
perhaps
my
nurse
would
call
it
thistledown
but
grown
folks
often
make
such
strange
mistakes
nobody
knows
such
as
i
on
fresh
dew
mornings
when
i
used
to
play
out
where
the
friendly
grows
so
high
the
pinks
and
would
lean
to
me
and
tell
me
secrets
of
my
summer
dear
it
lonesome
now
and
sad
as
it
can
be
since
summer
is
no
longer
here
the
dark
comes
down
so
soon
and
it
is
cold
i
wait
and
watch
the
sunset
track
but
mother
says
i
be
a
year
more
old
before
my
summer
will
come
back

when
you
wait
do
you
know
that
when
you
wait
to
tell
the
truth
and
fear
until
it
grows
too
late
god
leans
to
hear
punishment
some
days
my
is
so
bad
i
have
to
whip
her
very
hard
i
put
her
in
the
corner
there
and
take
away
her
she
put
to
bed
without
a
kiss
she
does
have
her
way
one
bit
but
then
am
the
one
it
hurts
and
so
what
is
the
use
of
it

first
pity
i
found
a
bird
that
hurt
it
flutters
so
and
cries
then
looks
its
pain
at
me
with
such
bright
frightened
eyes
its
feathers
are
so
soft
how
quiet
it
is
now
i
want
to
make
it
well
i
wish
my
hands
knew
how
night
i
do
not
like
to
say
i
hate
to
shut
my
eyes
when
of
the
stars
and
moon
make
play
surprise
the
night
is
such
a
i
love
it
more
than
day
the
dark
comes
close
and
calls
that
why
my
prayers
are
hard
to
say
it
is
the
that
comes
between
the
light
and
dark
the
little
squirrels
climb
into
their
nests
in
trees
and
hark
to
rustly
leaves
about
far
off
i
hear
new
insect
cries
from
things
which
never
dare
call
out
in
daytime
they
afraid
of
out
from
the
purply
wood
the
first
bat
circles
on
the
fly
far
things
draw
on
a
hood
and
shadows
hide
the
place
where
sky
and
earth
make
dim
their
line
the
trees
change
shape
and
soon
the
gray
blurs
into
black
and
that
the
hour
when
dark
comes
down
to
stay
treasure
craft
upon
the
brook
for
i
sail
some
petals
red
and
white
they
always
go
away
from
me
they
float
much
faster
in
their
flight
than
i
can
run
along
the
bank
my
precious
wee
bit
things
bear
freight
which
very
soon
falls
overboard
and
sinks
where
await
to
snatch
my
sparkling
perhaps
the
waters
dash
too
high
for
such
a
little
fleet
of
ships
and
that
may
be
the
reason
why
my
crafts
do
not
return
again
still
i
expect
them
any
day
i
lost
some
things
i
love
the
best
my
and
ribbons
gay
but
though
i
miss
these
pretty
things
i
love
much
more
the
and
launch
new
ships
when
morning
sings
and
rainbow
mist
floats
in
the
sun

the
moon
path
if
i
could
walk
along
the
path
the
moonlight
makes
upon
the
sea
i
know
that
i
should
find
the
one
who
sings
the
silver
song
to
me
the
ring
charm
i
have
a
little
charm
a
gypsy
gave
to
me
to
keep
me
safe
from
harm
so
ugly
things
ca
see
when
i
am
all
alone
it
keeps
the
all
out
when
trees
cry
so
and
moan
and
throw
their
leaves
about
it
keeps
away
the
woops
that
creep
about
my
bed
when
i
asleep
and
even
by
day
my
charm
keeps
anything
from
hurting
me
and
that
is
why
i
love
my
more
than
the
ones
i
buy
the
gypsy
put
it
on
for
me
and
said
some
words
so
strange
i
knew
that
they
must
be
some
fairy
charm
to
change
the
sad
things
into
gay
and
keep
me
safe
and
well
i
wear
it
every
day
for
that
to
keep
the
spell
each
morning
when
i
wake
i
kiss
and
turn
my
ring
three
times
for
sake
of
luck
these
wishes
bring
