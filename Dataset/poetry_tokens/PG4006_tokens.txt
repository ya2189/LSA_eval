best
foreword
this
little
volume
might
be
called
from
the
land
of
youthful
imaginings
or
of
old
dreams
it
has
been
compiled
at
the
request
of
messrs
gay
and
hancock
my
only
authorised
publishers
in
great
britain
and
contains
verses
written
in
my
early
youth
and
which
never
before
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
three
or
four
have
been
placed
in
book
form
given
the
poetical
temperament
and
a
lonely
environment
with
few
distractions
youthful
imagination
is
sure
to
express
itself
in
mournful
wails
and
despairing
moans
such
wails
and
moans
will
be
found
to
excess
in
this
little
book
and
will
serve
to
show
better
than
any
amount
of
reasoning
how
fleeting
are
the
sorrows
of
youth
and
how
slight
the
foundation
on
which
the
young
build
towers
of
despair
in
the
days
when
these
verses
were
written
each
little
song
represented
a
few
dollars
to
my
emaciated
purse
and
so
the
slightest
experience
of
my
own
or
of
any
friend
with
every
passing
mood
every
trivial
happening
was
utilised
by
my
imaginative
and
thrifty
muse
that
the
writer
has
always
possessed
robust
health
and
has
lived
to
a
good
age
is
proof
positive
that
the
verses
are
not
all
expressions
of
personal
experiences
since
no
human
being
could
have
borne
such
continual
agonies
and
retained
life
and
reason
all
the
verses
in
the
book
were
written
while
i
bore
the
name
of
ella
wheeler
and
are
quite
inconsistent
with
the
ideas
and
philosophy
of
ella
wheeler
wilcox
an
old
heart
how
young
i
am
ah
heaven
this
curse
of
youth
doth
mock
me
from
my
mirror
with
great
eyes
and
pulsing
veins
repeat
the
unwelcome
truth
that
i
must
live
though
hope
within
me
dies
so
young
and
yet
i
have
had
all
of
life
why
men
have
lived
to
see
a
hundred
years
who
have
not
known
the
rapture
joy
and
strife
of
my
brief
youth
its
passion
and
its
tears
oh
what
are
years
a
ripe
three
score
and
ten
hold
often
less
of
life
in
its
best
sense
than
just
a
twelvemonth
lived
by
other
men
whose
souls
are
ardent
and
intense
but
having
seen
all
depths
and
scaled
all
heights
having
a
heart
love
thrilled
and
sorrow
wrung
knowing
all
pains
all
pleasures
all
delights
now
i
would
die
but
can
not
being
young
nothing
is
left
me
but
supreme
despair
the
bitter
dregs
that
tell
of
wasted
wine
come
furrowed
brow
dull
eye
and
frosted
hair
companions
fit
for
this
old
heart
of
mine
warp
and
woof
through
the
sunshine
and
through
the
rain
of
these
changing
days
of
mist
and
splendour
i
see
the
face
of
a
pain
looking
at
me
with
a
smile
half
tender
with
a
smile
half
tender
and
yet
all
sad
into
each
hour
of
the
mild
september
it
comes
and
finding
my
life
grown
glad
looks
down
in
my
eyes
and
says
says
and
points
behind
to
days
of
sorrow
and
lashes
when
joy
lay
dead
and
hope
was
blind
and
nothing
was
left
but
dust
and
ashes
dust
and
ashes
and
vain
regret
flames
fanned
out
and
the
embers
falling
but
the
sun
of
the
saddest
day
must
set
and
hope
wakes
ever
with
springtime
calling
with
springtime
calling
the
pulses
thrill
and
the
heart
is
tuned
to
a
sweeter
measure
for
never
a
green
spring
crossed
the
hill
that
came
not
laden
with
some
new
pleasure
some
new
pleasure
that
brings
content
and
the
heart
looks
up
with
a
smile
of
gladness
and
wonders
idly
when
sorrow
went
out
of
the
life
that
seemed
all
sadness
that
seemed
all
sadness
and
yet
grew
bright
with
colours
we
thought
could
tinge
it
never
yet
i
think
the
pain
though
out
of
sight
like
the
warp
of
the
carpet
is
there
for
ever
there
for
ever
and
by
and
by
when
the
woof
wears
thin
or
draws
asunder
we
see
the
sombre
threads
that
lie
intertwining
and
twisting
under
twisting
under
and
binding
so
the
brighter
threads
that
they
may
not
sever
thus
the
pain
of
a
year
ago
must
stay
a
part
of
my
life
for
ever
so
long
the
dawn
grows
red
in
the
eastern
sky
long
so
long
is
the
day
and
i
lean
from
my
lattice
and
sigh
and
sigh
as
i
watch
the
night
fog
creeping
by
and
vanish
over
the
bay
the
thrush
soars
up
over
green
clad
hills
the
day
is
long
so
long
like
liquid
silver
his
music
spills
and
ever
it
quivers
and
runs
and
trills
in
a
glad
sweet
burst
of
song
under
my
window
there
blooms
a
rose
how
long
a
day
can
be
and
i
lean
and
whisper
what
no
soul
knows
of
my
heart
sorrows
and
secret
woes
and
the
red
rose
sighs
me
a
ship
sails
into
the
waiting
bay
the
day
is
long
alack
but
what
would
that
matter
to
me
i
pray
if
the
ship
that
sailed
out
yesterday
should
never
more
come
back
the
summer
sun
rides
high
and
clear
the
day
is
long
so
long
how
long
it
must
be
ere
it
grows
to
a
year
how
deep
the
sorrow
that
finds
no
tear
but
only
a
wail
of
song
if
i
could
only
weep
if
i
could
only
weep
i
think
sweet
help
with
my
salt
tears
would
come
to
ease
the
cruel
pain
that
is
so
dumb
and
will
not
let
me
sleep
down
in
my
heart
down
deep
a
poisoned
arrow
burns
it
would
fall
out
and
tears
would
wash
the
wound
i
have
no
doubt
if
i
could
only
weep
maybe
my
pulse
would
leap
and
bring
one
thrill
back
of
a
vanished
day
instead
of
throbbing
in
this
dull
dead
way
if
i
could
only
weep
o
silent
fates
who
steep
nectar
or
gall
for
us
through
all
the
years
take
what
thou
wilt
but
give
me
back
my
tears
and
let
me
weep
and
weep
why
should
we
sigh
why
should
we
sigh
a
summer
that
dead
let
us
think
of
the
summer
to
be
it
always
better
to
look
ahead
for
the
rose
will
come
again
just
as
red
and
just
as
fair
to
see
why
should
we
weep
a
pleasure
past
let
us
look
for
the
pleasure
to
be
new
shells
on
the
shore
by
new
waves
are
cast
let
us
prize
each
new
joy
more
than
the
last
and
laugh
if
the
old
joy
flee
what
folly
to
die
for
a
love
that
was
let
us
live
for
the
one
to
be
for
time
is
passing
and
will
not
pause
how
foolish
the
shore
were
it
sad
because
one
wave
ebbed
out
to
sea
then
let
us
not
sing
of
a
year
that
is
fled
though
dear
its
memory
be
for
though
summer
and
pleasure
and
love
seem
dead
love
will
be
sweet
and
the
rose
will
be
red
when
they
blossom
for
you
and
me
a
wakeful
night
in
the
dark
and
the
gloom
when
winds
were
fretting
like
restless
children
worn
out
with
play
i
said
to
my
heart
task
forgetting
is
harder
now
than
it
is
by
day
for
a
hungry
love
that
hides
from
the
light
like
a
tiger
steals
forth
and
is
bold
at
night
the
wind
wailed
low
like
a
woman
weeping
deeper
and
darker
the
dense
gloom
grew
and
oh
for
the
old
sweet
nights
of
sleeping
when
dreams
were
happy
and
love
was
true
before
the
stars
from
heaven
went
out
in
a
sudden
blackness
of
dread
and
doubt
the
wind
wailed
loud
like
a
madman
shrieking
and
i
said
to
my
heart
vain
vain
strife
we
can
not
forget
and
the
peace
we
are
seeking
can
only
be
won
at
the
end
of
life
for
see
like
a
lurid
and
living
spark
the
eyes
of
the
tiger
shine
through
the
dark
the
wind
sighed
low
like
a
sick
man
dying
and
the
dawn
crept
silently
over
the
hill
and
i
said
heart
there
is
no
use
trying
we
must
and
love
on
still
and
the
tiger
appeased
with
its
midnight
feast
fled
as
the
dawn
rose
red
in
the
east
if
one
should
dive
deep
once
more
on
the
beach
with
the
shifting
clouds
me
like
the
friends
of
a
day
and
the
sea
all
unchanged
like
a
true
friend
before
me
how
the
years
flow
away
how
the
summers
go
by
the
shifting
clouds
me
the
shifting
sands
under
why
need
it
seem
strange
why
need
i
feel
bitter
and
why
should
i
wonder
that
hearts
too
should
change
as
the
summers
go
by
down
here
is
the
path
where
we
wandered
together
the
midsummer
moon
her
love
was
sweet
as
the
sweet
summer
weather
and
left
us
as
soon
and
the
summers
go
by
the
bathers
laugh
loud
in
the
surf
over
yonder
if
one
should
dive
deep
and
rise
not
no
more
need
he
suffer
or
ponder
losses
or
weep
but
sink
low
and
sleep
while
the
summers
go
by
two
as
i
sat
in
my
opera
box
last
night
in
a
glimmer
of
gems
and
a
blaze
of
light
and
smiling
that
all
might
see
this
curious
thought
came
all
unsought
that
there
were
of
me
one
who
sat
in
her
silk
and
lace
with
gems
on
her
bosom
and
smiles
on
her
face
and
blossoms
in
her
hair
while
her
fan
kept
time
to
the
swaying
rhyme
of
the
lilting
opera
air
and
one
who
sat
in
the
dark
somewhere
with
her
wan
face
hid
by
her
falling
hair
and
her
hands
clasped
over
her
eyes
and
the
sickening
pain
of
heart
and
brain
breathed
out
in
sighs
one
in
the
sheen
of
her
opera
suit
and
one
who
was
swathed
from
head
to
foot
in
crepe
of
the
blackest
dye
one
hiding
her
heart
and
playing
a
part
and
one
with
her
mask
thrown
by
but
over
the
voice
of
the
singer
there
the
one
who
sat
with
a
rose
in
her
hair
seemed
ever
to
hear
the
moan
of
the
one
who
kept
in
the
dark
and
wept
with
her
desolate
heart
alone
no
comfort
o
mad
with
mirth
are
the
birds
that
over
my
head
are
winging
there
is
nothing
but
glee
in
the
roundelay
that
i
hear
them
singing
singing
on
wings
of
light
up
out
of
sight
i
watch
them
airily
flying
what
do
they
know
of
the
world
below
and
the
hopes
that
are
dying
dying
the
roses
turn
to
the
sun
warm
sky
their
sweet
lips
red
and
tender
oh
life
to
them
is
a
dream
of
bliss
of
love
and
passion
and
splendour
what
know
they
of
the
world
of
hearts
that
are
silently
breaking
of
the
human
breast
and
its
great
unrest
and
its
pitiless
aching
aching
they
send
me
out
into
nature
heart
for
help
to
bear
my
sorrow
nothing
of
strength
can
she
impart
no
peace
from
her
can
i
borrow
her
june
and
her
billing
tune
her
birds
and
blossoms
only
mocked
at
the
grief
that
seeks
relief
and
leave
me
lonely
lonely
if
i
might
stand
on
the
treacherous
sand
and
know
i
was
sinking
sinking
while
the
moaning
sea
sang
a
dirge
for
me
why
that
were
comfort
i
thinking
it
does
not
matter
it
does
not
matter
very
much
to
me
through
what
strange
ways
my
pathway
now
may
lead
since
i
know
that
it
runs
away
from
thee
i
give
it
little
heed
it
does
not
matter
if
in
calm
or
strife
there
ebb
or
flow
for
me
the
future
tide
i
had
but
one
great
longing
in
my
life
and
that
has
been
denied
it
does
not
matter
if
i
stand
or
fall
or
walk
with
kings
or
with
the
rank
and
file
life
loftiest
aims
and
best
ambitions
all
were
centred
in
thy
smile
it
does
not
matter
what
the
world
may
say
i
feel
no
interest
in
its
blame
or
praise
i
only
know
we
dwell
apart
and
shall
through
endless
days
it
does
not
matter
for
my
restless
heart
is
numb
to
sorrow
or
to
pleasure
touch
since
it
must
be
that
we
two
drift
apart
why
nothing
matters
much
the
in
the
dull
dim
dawn
of
day
i
heard
the
twitter
and
thrill
of
a
bird
as
he
sat
and
sang
in
the
leafless
tree
a
herald
of
beautiful
days
to
be
but
the
minor
running
under
the
strain
went
to
my
heart
with
a
sudden
pain
for
never
so
sad
a
sound
i
heard
as
the
troubled
thrill
of
the
bird
not
in
the
wearisome
wash
of
waves
with
moaning
murmur
of
wrecks
and
graves
not
in
the
weird
winds
wildest
wail
not
in
the
roar
of
the
rushing
gale
not
in
the
sob
of
dying
years
are
sounds
so
solemn
and
full
of
tears
o
herald
of
days
that
are
green
and
glad
why
was
your
morning
song
so
sad
have
you
a
secret
hidden
away
of
sorrow
to
come
with
a
coming
day
folded
under
a
folded
leaf
lies
there
trouble
and
bitter
grief
the
shadow
of
death
and
tears
and
gloom
coming
to
me
when
roses
bloom
will
the
beautiful
days
i
long
for
so
hold
like
your
song
a
strain
of
woe
what
is
the
secret
you
hide
from
me
o
herald
of
days
that
are
to
be
and
why
was
that
desolate
minor
moan
lurking
under
your
gladdest
tone
worth
living
i
know
not
what
the
future
may
hold
or
how
to
others
it
seems
but
i
know
my
skies
have
held
more
gold
than
i
used
to
find
in
my
dreams
though
the
whole
world
sings
of
hopes
death
chilled
in
grateful
truth
i
say
that
my
best
hopes
have
been
fulfilled
and
more
than
fulfilled
though
oft
my
arrow
i
aim
at
the
sun
to
see
it
fall
into
the
sand
yet
just
as
often
some
work
i
have
done
is
better
than
i
have
planned
i
do
not
always
grasp
the
pleasure
for
which
i
reach
maybe
but
quite
as
frequently
is
given
by
joy
to
me
may
bring
a
grief
behind
it
that
will
thoroughly
change
my
mood
but
we
only
can
speak
of
a
thing
as
we
find
it
and
i
have
found
life
good
more
fortunate
i
hold
that
life
more
fortunate
by
far
that
sits
with
its
sweet
memories
alone
and
cherishes
a
joy
for
ever
flown
beyond
the
reach
of
accident
to
mar
some
joy
that
was
extinguished
like
a
star
than
that
which
makes
the
prize
so
much
its
own
that
its
poor
commonplacenesses
are
shown
which
in
all
things
when
viewed
too
closely
are
better
to
mourn
a
blossom
snatched
away
before
it
reached
perfection
than
behold
with
dry
unhappy
eyes
day
after
day
the
fresh
bloom
fade
and
the
fair
leaf
decay
better
to
lose
the
dream
with
all
its
gold
than
keep
it
till
it
changes
to
dull
grey
he
will
not
come
take
out
the
blossom
in
your
hair
abloom
no
more
it
seemeth
beautiful
or
bright
and
sickening
is
its
subtly
sweet
perfume
he
will
not
come
take
off
the
necklace
with
its
sparkling
gem
and
rings
that
glow
and
glitter
in
the
light
and
fling
them
in
the
case
that
waits
for
them
he
will
not
come
take
off
the
robe
a
little
while
ago
you
chose
to
make
you
fairer
in
his
sight
ten
so
late
you
can
but
know
he
will
not
come
he
will
not
come
god
grant
you
strength
and
grace
for
never
more
upon
your
mortal
sight
shall
dawn
a
glimpse
of
that
beloved
face
that
did
not
come
he
will
not
come
and
through
the
shadowed
years
the
perfume
of
that
blossom
that
you
wore
shall
stir
the
fount
of
salt
and
bitter
tears
for
one
who
comes
no
more
worn
out
i
saw
a
young
heart
in
the
grasp
of
pain
with
bruised
breast
and
broken
bleeding
wing
shipwrecked
on
hopeless
love
tempestuous
main
lay
the
poor
tortured
thing
it
pulsed
with
all
the
anguish
of
despair
it
ached
with
all
a
fond
heart
awful
power
yet
i
who
stood
unhurt
above
it
there
envied
its
lot
that
hour
i
who
have
wasted
all
the
sacred
deep
emotions
of
my
soul
in
spendthrift
fashion
until
no
sorrow
now
can
make
me
weep
no
joy
stir
me
with
passion
i
who
have
scattered
here
and
there
the
gold
of
my
heart
store
until
i
spent
the
whole
yet
unto
each
so
little
gave
to
hold
that
i
enriched
no
soul
i
who
have
sold
the
birthright
of
sweet
tears
and
no
more
feel
a
thrill
in
pulse
or
brain
would
gladly
have
exchanged
my
tasteless
years
for
one
salt
hour
of
pain
weep
on
ye
mourners
glory
in
the
cross
of
some
great
grief
thank
god
you
do
not
know
the
greater
grief
that
comes
but
with
the
loss
of
power
to
suffer
woe
rondeau
as
you
forgot
i
may
forget
when
summer
dews
cease
to
be
wet
when
whippoorwills
disdain
the
night
when
sun
and
moon
are
no
more
bright
and
all
the
stars
at
midnight
set
when
jay
birds
sing
and
thrushes
fret
when
snowfalls
come
in
flakes
of
jet
when
hearts
that
shelter
love
are
light
i
may
forget
when
mortal
life
no
cares
beset
when
april
brings
no
violet
when
wrong
no
longer
wars
with
right
when
all
hope
ships
shall
heave
in
sight
and
memory
holds
no
least
regret
i
may
forget
trifles
only
a
spar
from
a
broken
ship
washed
in
by
a
careless
wave
but
it
brought
back
the
smile
of
a
vanished
lip
and
his
past
peered
out
of
the
grave
only
a
leaf
that
an
idle
breeze
tossed
at
her
passing
feet
but
she
seemed
to
stand
under
the
dear
old
trees
and
life
again
was
sweet
only
the
bar
of
a
tender
strain
they
sang
in
days
gone
by
but
the
old
love
woke
in
her
heart
again
the
love
they
had
sworn
should
die
only
the
breath
of
a
faint
perfume
that
floated
up
from
a
rose
but
the
bolts
slid
back
from
a
marble
tomb
and
i
looked
on
a
dear
dead
face
who
vaunts
the
might
of
a
human
will
when
a
perfume
or
a
sound
can
wake
a
past
that
we
bade
lie
still
and
open
a
long
closed
wound
courage
whether
the
way
be
dark
or
light
my
soul
shall
sing
as
i
journey
on
as
sweetly
sing
in
the
deeps
of
night
as
it
sang
in
the
burst
of
the
golden
dawn
nothing
can
crush
me
or
silence
me
long
though
the
heart
be
bowed
yet
the
soul
will
rise
higher
and
higher
on
wings
of
song
till
it
swims
like
the
lark
in
a
sea
of
skies
though
youth
may
fade
and
love
grow
cold
and
friends
prove
false
and
best
hopes
blight
yet
the
sun
will
wade
in
waves
of
gold
and
the
stars
in
glory
will
shine
at
night
though
all
earth
joys
from
my
life
are
missed
and
i
of
the
whole
world
stand
bereft
yet
dawns
will
be
purple
and
amethyst
and
i
can
not
be
sad
while
the
seas
are
left
for
i
am
a
part
of
the
mighty
whole
i
belong
to
the
system
of
life
and
death
i
am
under
the
law
of
a
great
central
and
strong
with
the
courage
of
love
and
faith
the
other
all
alone
with
my
heart
i
sit
and
wonder
and
sigh
what
is
she
like
is
she
dark
or
light
this
other
woman
who
has
the
right
to
love
him
better
than
i
we
never
have
spoken
her
name
we
two
there
was
no
need
somehow
but
she
lives
and
loves
and
her
heart
is
true
from
the
very
first
this
much
i
knew
so
why
should
it
hurt
me
now
i
fancy
her
tall
and
i
think
her
fair
oh
fairer
than
i
by
half
with
sweet
calm
eyes
and
a
wealth
of
hair
and
a
heart
as
perfectly
free
from
care
as
is
her
silvery
laugh
she
loves
rich
jewels
that
flash
in
the
light
and
revels
in
costly
lace
and
first
in
the
morning
and
last
at
night
she
kisses
one
ring
on
her
finger
white
how
came
those
tears
on
my
face
she
has
all
best
things
to
make
life
sweet
youth
and
beauty
and
gold
and
a
love
that
renders
it
quite
complete
i
wonder
why
from
my
head
to
my
feet
i
feel
so
deathly
cold
yet
in
all
the
store
of
her
great
delight
and
she
has
so
much
so
much
she
can
not
be
gladder
than
i
in
the
bright
sweet
smile
he
gave
her
when
he
said
good
night
and
his
warm
hand
close
kind
touch
i
must
put
out
the
light
and
go
to
bed
i
wonder
would
she
care
if
she
knew
when
i
knelt
with
low
bowed
head
i
prayed
for
her
but
that
i
said
his
name
the
last
in
my
prayer
mad
could
i
but
hear
you
laugh
across
the
street
though
i
or
mine
shared
nothing
in
your
glee
could
i
taste
that
one
drop
of
bitter
sweet
more
than
life
to
me
if
i
might
see
you
coming
through
the
door
though
with
averted
face
and
smileless
eye
were
i
allowed
that
little
boon
no
more
then
i
were
glad
to
die
but
oh
my
god
this
living
day
on
day
stripped
of
the
only
joy
your
starved
heart
had
shut
in
a
prison
world
and
forced
to
stay
why
that
way
souls
go
mad
i
heard
a
woman
say
the
earth
all
blossom
garlanded
was
fair
to
see
i
laughed
with
such
intensity
of
mirth
the
woman
shrank
from
me
fair
why
i
see
the
blackness
of
the
tomb
i
turn
and
grave
mould
on
each
brow
and
grinning
faces
peer
out
of
the
gloom
good
god
i
mad
now
which
we
are
both
of
us
sad
at
heart
but
i
wonder
who
can
say
which
has
the
harder
part
or
the
bitterer
grief
you
grieve
for
a
love
that
was
lost
before
it
had
reached
its
prime
i
sit
here
and
count
the
cost
of
a
love
that
has
lived
its
time
your
blossom
was
plucked
in
its
may
in
its
dawning
beauty
and
pride
mine
lived
till
the
august
day
and
reached
fruition
and
died
you
pressed
its
leaves
in
a
book
and
you
weep
sweet
tears
them
dry
eyed
i
sit
and
look
on
a
withered
and
broken
stem
and
now
that
all
is
told
which
is
the
sadder
pray
to
give
up
your
dream
with
its
gold
or
to
see
it
fade
into
grey
love
burial
see
him
quake
and
see
him
tremble
see
him
gasp
for
breath
nay
dear
he
does
not
dissemble
this
is
really
death
he
is
weak
and
worn
and
wasted
bear
him
to
his
bier
all
there
is
of
life
he
tasted
he
has
lived
a
year
he
has
passed
his
day
of
glory
all
his
blood
is
cold
he
is
wrinkled
thin
and
hoary
he
is
very
old
just
a
leaf
life
in
the
wild
wood
is
a
love
life
dear
he
has
reached
his
second
childhood
when
he
lived
a
year
long
ago
he
lost
his
reason
lost
his
trust
and
faith
better
far
in
his
first
season
had
he
met
with
death
let
us
have
no
pomp
or
splendour
no
vain
pretence
here
as
we
bury
grave
yet
tender
love
that
lived
a
year
all
his
strength
and
all
his
passion
all
his
pride
and
truth
these
were
wasted
spendthrift
fashion
in
his
fiery
youth
since
for
him
life
holds
no
beauty
let
us
shed
no
tear
as
we
do
the
last
sad
duty
love
has
lived
a
year
incomplete
the
summer
is
just
in
its
grandest
prime
the
earth
is
green
and
the
skies
are
blue
but
where
is
the
lilt
of
the
olden
time
when
life
was
a
melody
set
to
rhyme
and
dreams
were
so
real
they
all
seemed
true
there
is
sun
on
the
meadow
and
blooms
on
the
bushes
and
never
a
bird
but
is
mad
with
glee
but
the
pulse
that
bounds
and
the
blood
that
rushes
and
the
hope
that
soars
and
the
joy
that
gushes
are
lost
for
ever
to
you
and
me
there
are
dawns
of
amber
and
amethyst
there
are
purple
mountains
and
pale
pink
seas
that
flush
to
crimson
where
skies
have
kist
but
out
of
life
there
is
something
missed
something
better
than
all
of
these
we
miss
the
faces
we
used
to
know
the
smiling
lips
and
the
eyes
of
truth
we
miss
the
beauty
and
warmth
and
glow
of
the
love
that
brightened
our
long
ago
and
ah
we
miss
our
youth
on
rainy
days
on
rainy
days
old
dreams
arise
from
graves
where
they
have
lonely
lain
with
wan
white
cheeks
and
mournful
eyes
they
press
against
the
window
pane
one
dream
is
bolder
than
the
rest
she
enters
at
the
door
and
stays
a
welcome
yet
unbidden
guest
on
rainy
days
on
rainy
days
my
dream
and
i
turn
back
the
hands
of
memory
books
we
sup
on
pleasures
long
gone
by
we
drink
of
unforgotten
brooks
we
ransack
garrets
of
the
past
we
sing
old
songs
we
play
old
plays
while
hurrying
time
looks
on
aghast
on
rainy
days
on
rainy
days
my
ghostly
dreams
come
clothed
in
garments
like
the
mist
but
through
that
vapoury
veiling
gleams
the
lustrous
eyes
my
lips
have
kissed
a
radiant
head
leans
on
my
heart
we
walk
in
ways
but
oh
the
sorrow
when
we
part
on
rainy
days
geraldine
just
as
the
sun
went
bathing
in
a
sea
of
liquid
amber
flecked
with
caps
of
gold
i
told
the
sweet
old
story
unto
geraldine
my
queen
who
long
hath
made
the
whole
of
life
for
me
but
though
she
smiled
upon
me
yesterday
and
heaven
seemed
near
because
she
was
so
kind
i
find
she
held
me
but
as
one
of
many
men
and
then
dismissed
me
in
her
proud
yet
gracious
way
ah
geraldine
my
lady
of
sweet
arts
there
waits
for
thee
not
very
far
away
a
day
when
thou
shalt
waken
out
of
tranquil
sleep
and
weep
such
bitter
tears
as
spring
from
anguished
hearts
thou
shalt
look
in
thy
mirror
with
dismay
to
find
upon
each
feature
of
thy
face
the
trace
of
time
the
lover
who
shall
follow
thee
and
see
thy
rare
youth
slipping
suddenly
away
so
so
certain
of
thy
power
it
shall
come
on
thee
with
a
swift
surprise
thine
eyes
appalled
shall
fall
upon
each
certain
strange
sad
change
and
rob
thee
of
thy
triumph
in
an
hour
and
when
that
day
shall
come
as
come
it
must
you
then
will
think
of
me
sweet
geraldine
my
queen
and
of
the
faithful
heart
there
tossed
away
one
day
before
thy
dead
sea
apples
turned
to
dust
to
dust
and
ashes
leaving
nothing
more
that
day
will
come
my
lady
i
can
wait
and
fate
shall
right
my
wrongs
thou
smilest
geraldine
my
queen
ah
well
so
have
fair
women
smiled
before
only
in
dreams
how
strange
are
dreams
last
night
i
dreamed
about
you
all
that
old
bitterness
of
loss
and
pain
the
desolation
of
my
lot
without
you
the
keen
regret
all
all
came
back
again
again
i
faced
that
terrible
old
sorrow
too
numb
to
weep
too
cowardly
to
pray
again
the
blankness
of
a
dread
filled
me
with
sickly
terror
and
dismay
i
woke
in
tears
but
lo
a
moment
after
when
every
vestige
of
my
dream
was
fled
i
broke
the
silence
of
my
room
with
laughter
to
think
sleep
had
revived
a
thing
so
dead
thank
god
that
only
in
the
realms
of
fancy
can
that
old
sorrow
wake
again
to
strife
no
fate
is
strong
enough
no
necromancy
to
make
it
stir
one
pulse
of
my
calm
life
my
heart
is
light
my
lot
is
blest
without
you
our
early
sorrows
are
not
what
they
seem
now
in
my
slumber
if
i
dream
about
you
i
wake
to
laugh
at
such
an
idle
dream
circumstance
talk
not
to
me
of
souls
that
do
conceive
sublime
ideals
but
deterred
by
fate
and
bound
by
circumstances
sit
desolate
and
long
for
heights
they
never
can
achieve
it
is
not
so
that
which
we
most
desire
with
we
at
last
obtain
in
part
or
whole
i
hold
there
is
no
rain
no
deluge
that
can
quench
a
heavenly
fire
show
me
thy
labour
i
straightway
will
name
the
nature
of
thy
thoughts
who
bends
the
bow
and
lets
the
arrow
from
the
strained
string
go
strikes
somewhere
near
the
object
of
his
aim
we
build
our
ships
from
timbers
of
the
brain
with
products
of
the
soul
we
load
the
hold
where
lies
the
blame
if
they
bring
back
no
gold
or
if
they
spring
a
leak
upon
the
main
there
is
no
fate
no
providence
no
chance
the
will
is
all
so
be
it
thou
art
pure
and
strong
of
purpose
thy
success
is
sure
but
fools
and
sluggards
prate
of
circumstance
simple
creeds
if
this
were
our
creed
it
were
creed
enough
to
keep
us
thoughtful
and
make
us
brave
on
this
sad
journey
pathways
rough
that
lead
us
steadily
on
to
the
grave
no
cause
no
no
jest
that
can
pain
your
actions
and
bridle
your
are
adders
when
hearts
are
if
this
were
our
aim
it
were
all
in
sooth
that
any
soul
needs
to
climb
to
heaven
and
we
would
not
cumber
the
way
of
truth
with
dreary
dogmas
or
rites
priest
given
you
for
ever
needs
aid
from
never
a
day
die
in
the
you
have
not
comforted
some
sad
were
this
our
belief
we
need
not
brood
intricate
and
modes
of
faith
for
this
embodies
the
highest
goal
for
the
life
we
are
living
or
after
death
meet
no
trials
we
do
not
borne
sorrow
is
holy
shall
rise
in
a
harvest
of
golden
a
wise
soul
ever
thanks
god
for
the
bridal
eve
i
stand
in
the
blaze
of
the
candle
rays
while
my
merry
maidens
three
arrange
each
tress
and
loop
my
dress
and
render
me
fair
to
see
but
oh
for
the
eyes
that
never
again
will
smile
like
the
stars
on
me
i
sweep
down
the
stair
a
bride
most
fair
and
some
one
takes
my
hand
i
am
numb
and
cold
but
the
lie
is
told
i
smile
and
my
lord
is
bland
but
oh
for
a
sight
of
my
rover
wild
who
wanders
abroad
in
the
land
i
am
queen
of
the
ball
and
the
festal
hall
i
have
beauty
and
youth
and
gold
men
bow
at
the
shrine
of
this
lord
of
mine
lord
of
his
sums
untold
but
oh
to
be
off
in
the
wilds
with
my
lover
brave
and
bold
i
dream
a
dream
while
the
candles
gleam
while
the
dancers
merrily
glide
neath
the
evening
star
i
am
speeding
far
oh
a
good
steed
do
i
ride
and
my
heart
beats
high
with
hope
and
cheer
for
my
love
is
at
my
side
we
ride
and
sing
and
the
echoes
ring
with
our
voices
blithe
and
free
we
have
no
wealth
but
our
love
and
health
and
our
cot
on
the
wide
green
lea
but
i
love
my
love
with
a
mighty
love
and
i
know
that
he
loves
me
we
ride
away
in
the
dying
day
we
ride
till
we
reach
the
spot
where
all
alone
in
the
wilds
unknown
we
find
our
lonely
cot
and
i
have
no
wish
in
the
whole
wide
world
and
i
know
that
my
love
has
not
with
a
dreary
moan
the
viols
groan
and
the
dancers
pause
for
breath
and
my
lord
says
you
are
ill
i
fear
you
are
paler
than
your
wreath
o
god
o
god
to
be
out
in
the
night
riding
with
love
or
death
good
night
the
day
is
at
its
golden
height
no
shadow
falls
on
sea
or
land
and
yet
to
thee
i
say
good
night
as
we
stand
here
hand
clasped
in
hand
good
night
good
night
the
laughing
waves
are
summer
blue
the
bees
hum
in
the
sun
warm
light
but
frosts
of
winter
chill
me
through
i
shiver
as
i
say
good
night
good
night
good
night
how
often
at
the
close
of
day
with
smiling
lips
we
said
those
words
and
listened
as
we
turned
away
to
hear
them
echoed
by
the
birds
good
night
good
night
we
did
not
dream
then
of
this
hour
this
sad
sad
hour
for
you
and
me
we
did
not
dream
there
was
a
power
could
force
us
for
eternity
to
say
good
night
good
night
nay
turn
your
eyes
away
i
can
not
bear
their
tender
light
now
evermore
to
golden
day
to
golden
hope
a
last
good
night
good
night
good
night
no
place
when
days
grow
long
and
brain
and
hands
grow
weary
and
hot
the
city
street
forth
to
the
haunts
by
cooling
winds
made
cheery
we
fly
with
willing
feet
we
leave
our
cares
and
labours
all
behind
us
the
city
noise
and
din
and
hid
securely
where
they
can
not
find
us
we
drink
the
sunshine
in
but
when
the
days
grow
long
with
bitter
sorrow
and
hearts
grow
sick
with
woe
where
are
the
haunts
that
we
may
seek
where
can
we
hide
or
go
holds
earth
no
nook
where
hearts
with
sorrow
breaking
may
find
a
summer
rest
a
season
respite
from
the
weary
aching
that
gnaws
within
the
breast
o
god
if
we
could
fly
and
leave
behind
us
our
crosses
and
our
grief
could
hide
a
season
where
they
could
not
find
us
what
infinite
relief
found
found
as
i
rushed
through
the
great
world
mart
in
a
race
for
gold
and
a
pleasure
quest
a
passionate
throbbing
human
heart
suddenly
found
in
my
breast
i
had
always
laughed
at
the
foolish
word
i
had
said
aloud
in
my
boasting
glee
that
never
a
heart
in
my
bosom
stirred
that
my
governed
me
i
was
proud
with
the
sense
of
my
might
and
power
is
will
not
heart
that
wins
i
said
but
i
suddenly
found
one
sad
strange
hour
that
the
strength
of
my
will
had
fled
for
up
in
my
breast
there
rose
supreme
a
strong
man
heart
and
all
on
fire
drunk
with
the
wine
of
a
wild
sweet
dream
and
tortured
with
desire
it
is
tossed
with
hope
and
fear
and
doubt
it
is
mad
with
the
fever
of
love
unrest
i
wish
to
god
i
could
pluck
it
out
this
heart
i
found
in
my
breast
a
man
reverie
how
cold
the
old
porch
seems
a
dreary
chill
creeps
upward
from
the
river
at
twilight
and
yet
i
like
to
linger
here
at
night
and
dream
the
summer
tarries
with
us
still
the
summer
and
the
summer
guests
or
guest
men
rarely
dream
in
plurals
over
there
beyond
the
pillars
stands
the
rustic
chair
as
bare
and
empty
as
a
robin
nest
no
pretty
head
reclines
its
golden
bands
against
the
back
no
playful
winds
disclose
distracting
glimpses
of
embroidered
hose
no
palm
leaf
waves
in
dainty
dangerous
hands
how
cold
it
is
that
star
up
yonder
gleams
a
white
ice
sickle
from
the
heavenly
eaves
that
bleak
wind
from
the
river
sighs
and
grieves
perchance
some
poor
fellow
broken
dreams
come
in
and
shut
the
door
and
leave
that
star
to
watch
above
the
lonely
portico
summer
and
summer
guests
and
dreams
must
go
well
fate
was
kind
to
leave
me
my
cigar
when
my
sweet
lady
sings
when
she
my
lady
smiles
i
feel
as
one
who
lost
in
darksome
wilds
sees
suddenly
the
sun
in
middle
sky
shining
upon
him
like
a
great
glad
eye
when
my
sweet
lady
smiles
when
she
my
lady
laughs
i
feel
as
one
who
some
elixir
quaffs
some
nameless
nectar
made
of
wines
of
suns
and
through
my
veins
a
subtle
iveresse
runs
when
my
sweet
lady
laughs
and
when
my
lady
talks
i
am
as
one
who
by
a
brooklet
walks
some
brooklet
which
the
whole
long
day
holds
converse
with
the
birds
along
the
way
when
my
loved
lady
talks
and
when
my
lady
sings
oh
then
i
hear
the
beat
of
silver
wings
all
that
is
earthly
from
beneath
me
slips
and
in
the
liquid
cadence
of
her
lips
i
float
so
near
the
infinite
i
seem
lost
in
the
glory
of
a
white
starred
dream
when
my
sweet
lady
sings
spectres
how
terrible
these
nights
are
when
alone
with
our
scarred
hearts
we
sit
in
solitude
and
some
old
sorrow
to
the
world
unknown
does
suddenly
with
silent
steps
intrude
after
the
guests
departed
and
the
light
burned
dimly
in
my
room
there
came
to
me
as
noiselessly
as
shadows
of
the
night
the
spectre
of
a
woe
that
used
to
be
out
of
the
gruesome
darkness
and
the
gloom
i
saw
it
peering
and
in
still
despair
i
watched
it
gliding
swift
across
the
room
until
it
came
and
stood
beside
my
chair
why
need
i
tell
thee
what
its
shape
or
name
thou
hast
thy
secret
hidden
from
the
light
and
be
it
sin
or
sorrow
woe
or
shame
thou
dost
not
like
to
meet
it
in
the
night
and
yet
it
comes
as
certainly
as
death
and
far
more
cruel
since
death
ends
all
pain
on
lonesome
nights
we
feel
its
icy
breath
and
turn
and
face
the
thing
we
fancied
slain
with
shrinking
hearts
we
view
the
ghastly
shape
we
look
into
its
eyes
with
fear
and
dread
and
know
that
we
can
never
more
escape
until
the
grave
doth
fold
us
with
the
dead
on
the
swift
maelstrom
of
the
eddying
world
we
hurl
our
woes
and
think
they
are
no
more
but
round
and
round
by
dizzy
billows
whirled
they
reach
out
sinewy
arms
and
swim
to
shore
only
a
line
only
a
line
in
the
paper
that
somebody
read
aloud
at
a
table
of
languid
boarders
to
the
dull
indifferent
crowd
markets
and
deaths
and
a
marriage
and
the
reader
read
them
all
how
could
he
know
a
hope
died
then
and
was
wrapped
in
a
funeral
pall
only
a
line
in
the
paper
read
in
a
casual
way
but
the
glow
went
out
of
one
young
life
and
left
it
cold
and
grey
colder
than
bleak
december
greyer
than
walls
of
rock
but
the
reader
paused
and
the
room
grew
full
of
laughter
and
idle
talk
if
one
slipped
off
to
her
chamber
why
who
could
dream
or
know
that
one
brief
line
in
the
paper
had
sent
her
away
with
her
woe
away
into
lonely
sorrow
to
bitter
and
blinding
tears
only
a
line
in
the
paper
but
it
meant
such
desolate
years
parting
lean
down
and
kiss
me
o
my
love
my
own
the
day
is
near
when
thy
fond
heart
will
miss
me
and
my
low
green
bed
with
bitter
moan
thou
wilt
lean
down
but
can
not
clasp
or
kiss
me
how
strange
it
is
that
i
so
loving
thee
and
knowing
we
must
part
perchance
do
comfort
find
thinking
how
great
will
be
thy
lonely
desolation
and
thy
sorrow
and
stranger
sadder
o
mine
own
other
part
that
i
should
grudge
thee
some
surcease
of
weeping
why
do
i
not
rejoice
that
in
thy
heart
sweet
love
will
bloom
again
when
i
am
sleeping
nay
make
no
promise
i
would
place
no
bar
upon
thy
future
even
wouldst
thou
let
me
thou
hast
thou
dost
well
love
me
like
a
man
and
like
a
man
in
time
thou
wilt
forget
me
why
should
i
care
so
near
the
infinite
why
should
i
care
that
thou
wilt
cease
to
miss
me
o
god
these
earthly
ties
are
knit
so
tight
quick
quick
lean
lower
o
my
love
and
kiss
me
estranged
so
well
i
knew
your
habits
and
your
ways
that
like
a
picture
painted
on
the
skies
at
the
sweet
closing
of
the
summer
days
you
stand
before
my
eyes
i
see
you
on
the
old
verandah
there
while
slow
the
shadows
of
the
twilight
fall
i
see
the
very
carving
on
the
chair
you
tilt
against
the
wall
the
west
grows
dim
the
faithful
evening
star
comes
out
and
sheds
its
tender
patient
beam
i
almost
catch
the
scent
of
your
cigar
as
you
sit
there
and
dream
but
dream
of
what
i
know
your
outward
life
your
ways
your
habits
know
they
have
not
changed
but
has
one
thought
of
me
survived
the
strife
since
we
two
were
estranged
i
know
not
of
the
workings
of
your
heart
and
yet
i
sometimes
make
myself
believe
that
i
perchance
do
hold
some
little
part
of
reveries
at
eve
i
think
you
could
not
wholly
put
away
the
memories
of
a
past
that
held
so
much
as
birds
fly
homeward
at
the
close
of
day
a
word
a
kiss
a
touch
must
sometimes
come
and
nestle
in
your
breast
and
murmur
to
you
of
the
long
ago
oh
do
they
stir
you
with
a
vague
unrest
what
would
i
give
to
know
before
and
after
before
i
lost
my
love
he
said
to
me
i
like
deep
azure
tints
on
you
but
i
perverse
as
any
girl
will
be
who
has
too
many
lovers
wore
not
blue
he
said
love
to
see
my
lady
hair
coiled
low
like
clytie
with
no
wanton
curl
but
i
like
any
silly
wilful
girl
said
likes
it
high
and
wore
it
there
he
said
wish
love
when
you
sing
to
me
you
would
sing
sweet
sad
things
they
suit
your
voice
i
tossed
my
head
and
sung
light
strains
of
glee
saying
song
or
that
is
harold
choice
but
now
i
wear
no
colour
none
but
blue
low
in
my
neck
i
coil
my
silken
hair
he
does
not
know
it
but
i
strive
to
do
whatever
in
his
eyes
would
make
me
fair
i
sing
no
songs
but
those
he
loved
the
best
ah
well
no
wonder
for
the
mournful
strain
is
but
the
echo
of
the
voice
of
pain
that
sings
so
mournfully
within
my
breast
i
would
not
wear
a
ribbon
or
a
curl
for
donald
if
he
died
from
my
neglect
oh
me
how
many
a
vain
and
wilful
girl
learns
true
love
worth
but
when
her
life
is
wrecked
an
empty
crib
beside
a
crib
that
holds
a
baby
stocking
a
tattered
picture
book
a
broken
toy
a
sleeping
mother
dreams
that
she
is
rocking
her
cherub
boy
upon
the
cradle
side
her
light
touch
keeping
she
gently
rocks
it
crooning
low
a
song
and
smiles
to
think
her
little
one
is
sleeping
so
peacefully
and
long
step
light
breathe
low
break
not
her
rapturous
dreaming
wake
not
the
sleeper
from
her
trance
of
joy
for
never
more
save
in
sweet
will
she
watch
her
boy
god
pity
her
when
from
her
dream
elysian
she
wakes
to
see
the
empty
crib
and
weep
knowing
her
joy
was
but
a
sleeper
vision
tread
lightly
let
her
sleep
the
arrival
do
i
hear
at
the
window
did
some
one
call
me
nay
it
was
only
the
wind
my
darling
grieving
the
night
away
only
the
wind
and
the
casement
talking
as
two
friends
may
now
i
hear
some
one
speaking
oh
listen
and
you
will
hear
it
is
only
the
night
bird
calling
to
her
mate
in
sudden
fear
only
the
dead
leaves
falling
the
last
lone
leaves
of
the
year
now
there
is
some
one
coming
i
hear
a
step
on
the
stair
nay
nay
it
is
nothing
darling
rest
and
be
free
from
care
i
have
just
been
out
in
the
hallway
i
am
sure
there
is
no
one
there
never
a
knock
at
the
doorway
never
a
step
in
the
hall
yet
the
king
is
coming
coming
how
lightly
his
footsteps
fall
a
sigh
and
a
straightening
downward
and
silence
is
over
all
go
back
when
winds
of
march
by
the
springtime
bidden
over
the
great
earth
race
and
shout
forth
from
my
breast
where
it
long
hath
hidden
my
same
old
sorrow
comes
creeping
out
i
think
each
winter
its
life
is
ended
for
it
makes
no
stir
while
the
snows
lie
deep
i
say
to
myself
soul
has
blended
into
the
past
where
it
lay
asleep
but
as
soon
as
the
sun
like
some
fond
lover
smiles
and
kisses
the
earth
round
cheeks
this
sad
sad
sorrow
throws
off
its
cover
and
out
of
the
depths
of
its
anguish
speaks
in
every
bud
by
the
wayside
springing
it
finds
a
sword
for
its
wounds
in
every
note
that
the
thrush
is
singing
it
hears
the
saddest
of
minor
sounds
in
the
cup
of
gold
that
the
sun
is
spilling
it
finds
unsweetened
a
drop
of
gall
it
sees
through
the
warp
that
the
spring
is
filling
the
black
threads
twining
in
under
it
all
go
back
o
spring
till
pain
forsaking
these
haunts
of
sorrow
shall
sink
to
rest
go
back
go
back
for
my
heart
is
breaking
and
the
same
old
anguish
hurts
my
breast
why
i
love
her
why
do
i
love
my
sweetheart
well
i
really
never
tried
to
tell
i
love
her
mayhap
for
her
smile
so
innocent
and
free
from
guile
perhaps
i
love
her
for
her
mien
so
calmly
cheerful
and
serene
or
it
may
be
her
silken
hair
first
caught
and
tangled
cupid
there
and
since
i
came
to
analyse
her
chiefest
beauty
is
her
eyes
her
mouth
too
that
is
cupid
bow
perhaps
that
why
i
love
her
so
and
now
i
think
of
it
her
voice
first
made
my
rusty
heart
rejoice
and
then
her
hand
is
my
belief
it
quite
outvies
the
lily
leaf
perhaps
i
love
her
for
her
ways
that
blend
in
with
the
sunny
days
tush
to
be
brief
and
plain
with
you
i
love
her
because
i
discontent
like
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
like
a
fly
in
the
mesh
like
a
boat
that
is
chained
to
shore
the
wild
unrest
of
the
heart
in
my
breast
tortures
me
more
and
more
i
wot
not
why
it
should
wail
and
cry
like
a
child
that
is
lost
at
night
for
it
knew
no
grief
but
has
found
relief
and
it
is
not
touched
with
blight
it
has
had
of
pleasure
full
many
a
measure
it
has
thrilled
with
love
red
wine
it
has
hope
and
health
and
youth
rare
wealth
oh
rich
is
this
heart
of
mine
yet
it
is
not
glad
it
is
wild
and
mad
like
a
billow
before
it
breaks
and
its
ceaseless
pain
is
worse
than
vain
since
it
knows
not
why
it
aches
it
longs
to
be
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
that
rise
in
their
might
and
beat
and
dash
and
lunge
and
hurry
and
plunge
and
die
at
the
grey
rocks
feet
it
wearies
of
life
and
it
sickens
of
strife
and
yet
it
tires
of
rest
oh
i
know
not
why
it
should
ache
and
cry
is
a
troublesome
heart
at
best
though
not
understood
i
think
it
a
good
and
discontent
it
springs
from
the
soul
that
longs
for
its
goal
for
the
source
from
which
it
was
sent
then
surge
o
breast
with
thy
wild
unrest
cry
heart
like
a
child
at
night
till
the
mystic
shore
of
the
evermore
shall
dawn
on
thy
eager
sight
a
dream
in
the
night
i
dreamed
that
you
had
died
and
i
thought
you
lay
in
your
winding
sheet
and
i
kneeled
low
by
your
coffin
side
with
my
cheek
on
your
heart
that
had
ceased
to
beat
and
i
thought
as
i
looked
on
your
form
so
still
a
terrible
woe
and
an
awful
pain
fierce
as
vultures
that
slay
and
kill
tore
at
my
bosom
and
maddened
my
brain
and
then
it
seemed
that
the
chill
of
death
over
me
there
like
a
mantle
fell
and
i
knew
by
my
fluttering
failing
breath
that
the
end
was
near
and
all
was
well
i
woke
from
my
dream
in
the
black
midnight
it
was
only
a
dream
at
worst
or
best
but
i
lay
and
thought
till
the
dawn
of
light
had
the
dream
been
true
we
had
both
been
blest
better
to
kneel
by
your
still
dead
form
with
my
cheek
on
your
breast
and
die
that
way
than
to
live
and
battle
with
night
and
storm
and
drift
away
from
you
day
by
day
better
the
anguish
of
death
and
loss
the
sharp
quick
pain
and
the
darkness
then
than
living
on
with
this
heavy
cross
to
bear
about
in
the
world
of
men
the
night
oh
give
me
the
night
the
dark
dark
night
the
night
with
never
a
star
when
the
stars
are
veiled
and
the
moon
has
sailed
beyond
the
horizon
bar
when
thought
grows
weary
of
groping
its
way
through
darkness
dense
and
deep
and
buries
its
head
in
oblivion
bed
wrapped
warm
in
the
mantle
of
sleep
for
i
hate
the
night
the
night
the
night
with
a
pallid
face
when
a
million
eyes
from
the
watchful
skies
peers
into
each
secret
place
for
thought
awakes
and
the
old
wound
aches
and
sorrow
she
can
not
rest
but
all
night
long
walks
to
and
fro
through
the
aisles
of
my
troubled
breast
and
memory
thinks
it
her
royal
hour
when
the
heavens
glitter
and
shine
and
she
fills
the
cup
of
the
past
well
up
with
a
bitter
and
scalding
wine
and
she
calls
for
a
toast
to
the
ghastly
ghost
of
a
joy
that
used
to
be
and
that
terrible
face
in
the
dear
old
moon
stares
steadily
down
at
me
so
give
me
the
night
the
deep
dark
night
the
night
with
never
a
star
when
the
skies
are
veiled
and
the
moon
has
sailed
beyond
the
horizon
bar
new
year
the
year
like
a
ship
in
the
distance
comes
over
life
mystical
sea
we
know
not
what
change
of
existence
is
bringing
to
you
or
to
me
but
we
wave
out
the
ship
that
is
leaving
and
we
welcome
the
ship
coming
in
although
it
be
loaded
with
grieving
with
trouble

old

fading

from
our
view
all
idleness

all
hatred
and

with
you

bitterness

and

tasks
for
the
world
reverie
the
day
has
been
wild
and
stormy
and
full
of
the
wind
unrest
and
i
sat
down
alone
by
the
window
while
the
sunset
dyed
the
west
and
the
holy
rush
of
twilight
as
the
day
went
over
the
hill
like
the
voice
of
a
spirit
seemed
speaking
and
saying
be
still
then
i
thought
with
sudden
longing
that
it
might
be
so
with
my
woes
that
the
life
so
wild
and
restless
when
it
reached
the
eve
repose
might
glow
with
a
sudden
glory
and
be
crowned
with
peace
and
rest
and
the
holy
calm
of
twilight
might
come
to
my
troubled
breast
all
of
the
pain
and
passion
that
trouble
my
life
long
day
as
the
winds
go
down
at
sunset
may
suddenly
pass
away
and
the
wild
and
turbulent
billows
that
surge
in
my
heart
at
will
shall
be
hushed
into
calm
and
silence
by
the
whisper
be
still
and
my
soul
grew
full
of
patience
and
i
said
can
bear
it
all
though
the
day
be
long
and
stormy
the
twilight
at
last
must
fall
the
law
the
tide
of
love
swells
in
me
with
such
force
it
sweeps
away
all
hate
and
all
distrust
as
eddying
straws
and
particles
of
dust
are
lost
by
some
swift
river
in
its
course
so
much
i
love
my
friends
my
life
my
art
each
shadow
flies
the
light
dispels
the
gloom
love
is
so
fair
i
find
i
have
no
room
for
anything
less
worthy
in
my
heart
love
is
a
germ
which
we
can
cultivate
to
grace
and
perfume
sweeter
than
the
rose
or
leave
neglected
while
our
heart
soil
grows
rank
with
that
vile
and
poison
thistle
hate
love
is
a
joyous
thrush
that
one
can
teach
to
sing
sweet
songs
which
all
may
hear
or
we
can
silence
him
and
tune
the
ear
to
caw
of
crows
or
to
the
vulture
screech
love
is
a
feast
and
if
the
guests
divide
with
all
who
pass
though
thousands
swell
the
van
there
shall
be
food
and
drink
for
every
man
the
loaves
and
fishes
will
be
multiplied
love
is
the
guide
i
look
to
heights
above
so
beautiful
so
very
far
away
yet
i
shall
tread
their
sunlit
peaks
some
day
since
close
in
mine
i
hold
the
hand
of
love
love
is
the
law
but
yield
to
its
control
and
thou
shalt
find
all
things
work
for
the
best
and
in
the
calm
still
heaven
of
thy
breast
that
god
himself
sits
talking
with
thy
soul
spirit
of
a
great
control
spirit
of
a
great
control
gird
me
with
thy
strength
and
might
essence
of
the
fill
me
thrill
me
with
thy
light
though
the
waves
of
sorrow
beat
madly
at
my
very
feet
though
the
night
and
storm
are
near
teach
me
that
i
need
not
fear
though
the
clouds
obscure
the
sky
when
the
tempest
sweeps
the
lands
still
about
below
on
high
god
great
solar
system
stands
never
yet
a
star
went
out
what
have
i
to
fear
or
doubt
i
a
part
of
this
great
whole
governed
by
the
like
the
great
eternal
hills
like
the
rock
that
fronts
the
wave
let
me
meet
all
earthly
ills
with
a
fearless
heart
and
brave
like
the
earth
that
drinks
the
rain
let
me
welcome
floods
of
pain
till
i
grow
in
strength
to
be
worthy
of
my
source
in
thee
noon
as
some
contented
bird
doth
coo
she
trilled
a
song
of
fond
delight
the
while
she
spread
the
cloth
of
white
and
set
the
cups
and
plates
for
two
she
leaned
beyond
the
window
sill
and
looked
along
the
busy
street
and
listened
for
his
coming
feet
the
skies
were
calm
the
winds
were
still
love
my
love
why
art
thou
late
the
kettle
boils
the
cloth
is
spread
the
clock
points
close
to
noon
she
said
o
clock
of
time
o
clock
of
fate
she
heard
the
moon
glad
sound
of
cheer
the
hiss
the
whirl
the
crash
the
creak
of
maddened
wheels
the
awful
shriek
of
awestruck
men
she
did
not
hear
she
lightly
tripped
about
the
room
and
near
the
window
where
his
eyes
might
greet
it
with
a
pleased
surprise
she
placed
a
pot
of
fragrant
bloom
strange
nervous
steps
were
at
the
gate
why
grew
her
heart
so
cold
so
numb
the
clock
struck
twelve
the
noon
had
come
ah
noon
of
time
o
noon
of
fate
a
shattered
vase
beside
the
wall
a
young
face
grey
with
awful
fear
a
rigid
shape
a
covered
bier
a
shadowed
life
and
that
is
all
the
search
the
rain
falls
long
and
the
rain
falls
light
with
a
desolate
drip
drop
sad
to
hear
but
never
a
star
shines
through
the
night
as
i
sit
afar
from
the
world
anear
down
in
the
parlour
some
one
sings
the
children
laugh
in
the
nursery
hall
but
my
heart
like
a
bird
has
spread
its
wings
and
leaves
the
music
and
mirth
and
all
out
in
the
rain
and
the
eerie
night
into
the
darkness
it
speeds
away
ah
me
ah
me
is
a
gruesome
flight
seeking
for
you
till
the
dawn
of
day
if
it
only
knew
which
way
to
go
where
you
wander
or
where
you
lie
to
valleys
of
sunshine
or
hills
of
snow
thither
at
once
my
heart
would
fly
fly
and
follow
wherever
you
led
over
the
desert
and
over
the
wave
or
if
it
found
you
lying
dead
it
would
sit
in
the
rain
by
your
lonely
grave
sit
in
the
rain
and
cover
the
grass
with
passionate
kisses
above
your
face
sit
there
waiting
till
death
should
pass
and
bear
it
to
you
in
his
strong
embrace
but
hither
and
thither
all
is
vain
it
flies
in
the
darkness
and
seeks
for
you
back
in
the
morning
drenched
with
rain
the
poor
thing
cometh
with
never
a
clue
but
all
night
long
the
rain
falls
down
like
a
poor
crazed
thing
that
has
lost
its
way
through
the
forest
and
through
the
town
it
searches
for
you
till
the
break
of
day
a
man
do
you
think
dear
as
you
say
such
a
light
that
this
parting
time
may
be
mayhaps
less
to
you
than
me
what
a
wonder
of
surprise
looks
out
from
your
sunny
eyes
a
nice
acquaintance
so
we
have
called
it
dear
i
know
now
you
end
it
with
a
word
while
my
inmost
soul
is
stirred
no
you
can
not
understand
but
dear
as
i
touch
your
hand
listening
to
your
light
all
a
man
roused
passions
cry
like
a
tiger
stirred
at
bay
oh
you
draw
your
hand
away
no
right
to
speak
so
pray
was
it
right
day
by
day
by
your
sweet
coquettish
arts
to
invade
my
heart
of
hearts
it
is
death
to
let
you
go
you
will
hate
me
dear
i
know
but
i
swear
ere
you
go
hence
i
will
have
some
recompense
for
those
fires
you
lit
in
vain
cheeks
and
lips
shall
bear
the
stain
of
my
kisses
till
you
die
go
now
this
is
my
at
the
hop
time
to
dress
dost
hear
the
music
surging
like
sobbing
waves
that
roll
up
from
the
sea
yes
yes
i
hear
i
yield
no
need
of
urging
i
know
your
wishes
send
lisette
to
me
i
hate
the
ballroom
hate
its
gilded
pleasure
i
hate
the
crowd
within
it
well
you
know
but
what
of
that
i
am
your
lawful
treasure
and
when
you
would
display
me
i
must
go
you
bought
me
with
a
mother
pain
and
trouble
i
been
a
great
expense
to
you
alway
and
now
if
you
can
sell
me
and
get
double
the
sum
i
cost
why
what
have
i
to
say
you
done
your
duty
kept
me
in
the
fashion
and
shown
me
off
at
every
stylish
place
was
not
your
fault
i
had
a
heart
of
passion
was
not
your
fault
i
ever
his
face
the
dream
was
brief
and
beautiful
and
tender
o
god
to
live
those
golden
hours
once
more
the
silver
moonlight
and
his
dark
eyes
splendour
the
sky
above
us
and
the
sea
before
come
come
lisette
bring
out
those
royal
laces
must
make
the
victory
complete
among
the
crowd
of
masked
and
smiling
faces
i
move
with
laughter
and
with
smiles
most
sweet
make
me
most
fair
with
youth
and
grace
and
beauty
i
needs
must
conquer
bloated
age
and
gold
she
shall
not
say
i
have
not
done
my
duty
i
ready
now
a
daughter
to
be
sold
met
how
odd
and
strange
seems
our
meeting
like
a
grim
rendezvous
of
the
dead
all
day
i
have
sat
here
repeating
the
commonplace
things
that
we
said
they
sounded
so
oddly
when
uttered
they
sound
just
as
odd
to
me
now
it
we
or
our
two
ghosts
who
muttered
last
evening
with
simper
and
bow
i
had
grown
used
to
living
without
you
in
revel
and
concert
and
ball
i
had
flown
from
much
thinking
about
you
and
your
picture
i
turned
to
the
wall
for
to
call
back
the
dream
that
was
broken
to
fancy
your
hand
on
my
hair
to
remember
the
words
we
had
spoken
was
madness
and
gall
and
despair
i
knew
i
could
never
forget
you
but
i
wanted
to
put
you
away
and
now
just
to
think
how
i
met
you
it
has
seemed
like
a
nightmare
all
day
we
two
with
our
record
of
passion
we
two
who
have
been
as
one
heart
to
meet
in
that
calm
quiet
fashion
and
chat
for
a
moment
and
part
we
two
who
remember
such
blisses
not
heaven
itself
can
eclipse
we
two
who
had
kissed
with
the
kisses
that
draw
out
the
soul
through
the
lips
we
two
who
have
known
the
ideal
the
rare
perfect
love
in
its
might
nay
nay
they
were
ghosts
and
not
real
who
met
and
who
parted
last
night
they
were
ghosts
unprepared
for
the
meeting
was
a
chance
rendezvous
of
the
dead
and
all
day
i
sit
here
repeating
the
odd
sounding
words
that
were
said
returned
birds
my
heart
is
like
a
southern
wood
through
summer
months
it
has
been
drunk
with
heat
and
slumbered
on
unmindful
of
the
beat
of
life
beyond
it
sleep
alone
seemed
good
now
milder
autumn
tints
are
in
the
sky
the
fervid
heats
of
summer
noons
depart
and
backward
to
the
old
haunts
in
my
heart
the
golden
robins
and
the
blue
birds
fly
i
hear
the
flutter
of
their
airy
wings
they
flock
about
the
spring
deserted
nest
and
suddenly
i
feel
within
my
breast
the
stirring
of
sweet
things
bright
sunny
mornings
golden
growing
hours
the
building
of
glad
birds
among
the
trees
wide
open
windows
and
the
kindly
breeze
bringing
the
perfume
of
flowers
a
blithe
face
at
the
window
fair
with
truth
a
mellow
laugh
that
falls
like
silver
spray
down
through
the
sunlight
of
the
perfect
day
ecstatic
hopes
that
bud
with
spring
and
youth
the
morning
time
grew
rank
with
summer
blight
the
birds
flew
northward
fresher
fields
to
find
and
in
our
hearts
we
closed
the
folding
blind
while
drooping
blossoms
withered
in
the
light
the
fair
face
at
the
window
could
not
stay
the
laugh
grew
weary
with
a
minor
strain
that
borders
on
the
foreign
realm
of
pain
and
hopes
that
blossomed
ripened
to
decay
come
happy
birds
and
sing
of
vanished
joy
of
that
sweet
spring
for
ever
passed
away
no
winter
lies
between
us
and
that
day
but
what
is
sadder
than
the
sweets
that
cloy
my
heart
is
green
with
leafage
come
and
wake
the
echoes
with
the
songs
of
glee
for
only
echoes
now
are
left
to
me
though
bloom
and
beauty
cling
to
bush
and
brake
a
crushed
leaf
an
hour
ago
when
the
wind
blew
high
at
my
lady
window
a
red
leaf
beat
then
dropped
at
her
door
where
passing
by
she
carelessly
trod
it
under
her
feet
i
have
taken
it
out
of
the
dust
and
dirt
with
a
tender
pity
but
half
defined
ah
poor
bruised
leaf
with
your
stain
and
hurt
doth
make
us
kind
on
winds
of
passion
my
heart
was
blown
like
an
autumn
leaf
one
hapless
day
at
my
lady
window
with
tap
and
moan
it
burned
and
fluttered
its
life
away
bright
with
the
blood
of
its
wasting
tide
it
glowed
in
the
sun
of
her
laughing
eyes
what
cared
she
though
a
stray
heart
died
what
to
her
were
its
sobs
and
sighs
the
winds
of
passion
were
spent
at
last
and
my
heart
like
the
leaf
in
her
pathway
lay
and
under
her
slender
foot
as
she
passed
my
lady
she
trod
it
and
went
her
way
so
i
picked
the
leaf
from
its
dusty
place
with
a
tender
pity
too
well
defined
and
i
laid
it
here
in
this
velvet
case
ah
a
doth
make
us
kind
a
curious
story
i
heard
such
a
curious
story
of
santa
claus
once
so
they
say
he
set
out
to
see
what
people
were
kind
before
he
took
presents
their
way

will
give
but

those
who
make
presents

a
nod

his
head

into
our
homes

christmas
came
all
in
its
season
and
santa
claus
so
i
am
told
with
a
very
light
pack
of
small
gifts
on
his
back
and
his
reindeers
all
left
in
the
fold
set
out
on
a
leisurely
journey
and
finished
ere
midnight
they
say
and
there
never
had
been
such
surprise
and
chagrin
before
on
the
breaking
of
day
as
there
was
on
that
bright
christmas
morning
when
stockings
and
cupboards
and
shelves
were
ransacked
and
sought
in
for
gifts
that
were
not
in
but
was
it
fun
for
the
elves
and
what
did
get
you
confuse
me
got
not
one
and
that
true
but
had
i
suspected
my
actions
detected
i
would
have
had
gifts
would
you
jenny
lind
there
was
a
something
in
your
song
men
say
no
later
singer
voices
some
strange
power
like
to
the
essence
in
a
rare
june
day
or
like
the
subtle
perfume
of
a
flower
awed
and
inspired
your
listeners
turned
away
baptized
in
your
sweet
music
holy
shower
for
through
that
music
shone
the
glorious
dower
of
your
great
soul
here
all
the
secret
lay
not
for
the
honours
of
this
earth
you
sang
not
for
its
gold
or
glory
not
for
art
not
for
the
fortunes
at
your
fair
feet
hurled
the
love
of
god
through
all
your
measures
rang
and
each
pure
note
bespoke
a
noble
heart
when
worth
weds
genius
lo
they
rule
the
world
life
key
the
hand
that
fashioned
me
tuned
my
ear
to
chord
with
the
major
key
in
the
darkest
moments
of
life
i
hear
strains
of
courage
and
hope
and
cheer
from
choirs
that
i
can
not
see
and
the
music
of
life
seems
so
inspired
that
it
will
not
let
me
grow
sad
or
tired
yet
through
and
under
the
major
strain
i
hear
with
the
passing
of
years
the
mournful
minor
measure
of
pain
of
souls
that
struggle
and
toil
in
vain
for
a
goal
that
never
nears
and
the
sorrowful
cadence
of
good
gone
wrong
breaks
more
and
more
into
earth
glad
song
and
oft
in
the
dark
of
the
night
i
wake
and
think
of
sorrowing
lives
and
i
long
to
comfort
the
hearts
that
ache
to
sweeten
the
cup
that
is
bitter
to
take
and
to
strengthen
each
soul
that
strives
i
long
to
cry
to
them

help
is
coming
and
aid
is
near

strange

sounds
to
you
before
the
air
may
change
and
the
great
director
of
music
arrange
a
programme
perfectly
new
and
the
dirge
in
minor
may
suddenly
be
turned
into
a
jubilant
song
of
glee
bridge
of
prayer
the
bridge
of
prayer
from
heavenly
heights
suspended
unites
the
earth
with
in
space
the
interests
of
those
separate
worlds
are
blended
for
those
whose
feet
turn
often
toward
that
place
in
troubled
nights
of
sorrow
and
repining
when
joy
and
hope
seem
sunk
in
dark
despair
we
still
may
see
above
the
shadows
shining
the
gleaming
archway
of
the
bridge
of
prayer
from
that
fair
height
our
souls
may
lean
and
listen
to
sounds
of
music
from
the
farther
shore
and
through
the
vapours
sometimes
dear
eyes
glisten
of
loved
ones
who
have
hastened
on
before

angels
come
from
their
celestial

us

those

i

thee
in

to
make

grateful
and
not

i
need
thee
when
the
weight
of
sorrow
presses
the
tortured
heart
that
cries
aloud
in
pain
so
close
great
pleasures
and
great
anguish
lie
lord
lord
come
nigh
un
rencontre
now
ought
we
to
laugh
or
to
weep
was
it
comical
or
was
it
grave
when
we
who
had
waded
breast
deep
in
passion
most
turbulent
wave
met
out
on
an
isle
in
time
ocean
with
never
one
thrill
of
emotion
we
had
parted
in
sorrow
and
tears
our
letters
were
frequent
and
wet
we
wrote
about
pitiless
years
and
we
swore
we
could
never
forget
an
angel
you
called
me
alway
and
i
thought
you
a
god
gone
astray
we
met
in
an
everyday
style
unmoved
by
a
tremor
or
start
shook
hands
smiled
a
commonplace
smile
with
a
happy
new
love
in
each
heart
and
i
thought
you
the
homeliest
man
as
you
awkwardly
picked
up
my
fan
and
i
know
or
i
have
a
doubt
though
you
did
not
say
so
to
my
face
that
you
thought
i
was
growing
too
stout
i
once
your
ideal
of
grace
and
ere
the
encounter
was
each
voted
the
other
a
bore
what
a
proof
that
fond
passion
can
die
in
this
prosaic
meeting
we
had
now
ought
we
to
laugh
or
to
cry
was
it
sorrowful
or
was
it
sad
is
a
puzzle
not
worthy
our
time
so
let
give
it
up
with
this
rhyme
burned
out
blow
out
the
light
there
is
no
oil
to
feed
it
that
dim
blue
light
unworthy
of
the
name
better
to
sit
with
folded
hands
i
say
and
wait
for
night
to
pass
and
bring
the
day
than
to
depend
upon
that
flickering
flame
take
back
your
vow
there
is
no
love
to
bind
it
take
back
this
little
shining
golden
thing
better
to
walk
on
bravely
all
alone
than
strive
to
hold
up
or
retain
our
own
by
soulless
pledge
or
fetter
of
a
ring
when
first
the
lamp
was
lit
too
high
you
turned
it
the
oil
was
wasted
in
a
blinding
blaze
your
passion
was
too
ardent
in
the
start
set
by
the
lamp
farewell
god
gird
the
heart
through
darkened
hours
and
lone
and
loveless
ways
only
a
glove
only
a
glove
that
has
touched
her
fingers
but
it
seems
to
me
something
half
divine
a
delicate
fragrance
about
it
lingers
and
it
stirs
my
blood
like
wine
yes
thrills
and
warms
me
like
wine
so
well
i
remember
the
night
she
wore
it
how
i
held
the
hand
in
its
dainty
glove
and
whispered
sweetly
as
i
leaned
it
whispered
a
tale
of
love
a
story
of
my
mad
love
there
was
mirth
and
music
and
light
and
laughter
the
viols
played
and
the
dancers
whirled
we
were
part
of
it
all
but
a
moment
after
were
alone
in
love
fair
world
alone
in
god
own
world
but
now
of
that
night
of
glow
and
splendour
of
happy
hope
and
beautiful
love
of
youthful
dreams
that
were
sweetly
tender
there
is
nothing
left
but
a
glove
nothing
but
this
one
glove
reminders
when
in
the
early
dawn
i
hear
the
thrushes
and
like
a
flood
of
waters
my
heart
the
memory
of
another
summer
rushes
how
can
i
rise
up
and
perform
my
part
when
in
the
languid
eve
i
hear
the
wailing
of
the
uncomforted
sad
mourning
dove
whose
grief
like
mine
seems
deep
as
unavailing
what
will
i
do
with
all
this
wealth
of
love
when
the
sweet
rain
falls
over
hills
and
meadows
and
the
tall
poplar
silver
leaves
are
wet
and
like
my
soul
the
world
seems
draped
in
shadow
how
shall
i
hush
this
passionate
regret
when
the
wild
bee
is
wooing
the
red
clover
and
the
fair
rose
smiles
on
the
butterfly
missing
thy
smile
and
kiss
o
love
my
lover
who
on
god
earth
so
desolate
as
i
my
tortured
senses
new
despair
will
borrow
from
those
reminders
of
a
vanished
day
that
was
as
full
of
joy
as
this
of
sorrow
o
beautiful
sad
summer
keep
away
a
dirge
death
and
a
dirge
at
midnight
yet
never
a
soul
in
the
house
heard
anything
more
than
the
throb
and
beat
of
a
beautiful
waltz
of
strauss
dead
dead
dead
and
staring
with
a
ghastly
smile
on
its
face
but
the
world
saw
only
laughing
eyes
and
roses
and
billows
of
lace
floating
and
whirling
together
into
the
beautiful
night
how
little
you
dreamed
of
the
ghastly
thing
i
was
hiding
away
from
your
sight
meeting
your
dark
eyes
splendour
feeling
your
warm
sweet
breath
how
could
you
know
that
my
passionate
heart
had
died
a
horrible
death
died
in
its
fever
and
fervour
died
in
its
beautiful
bloom
and
that
waltz
of
strauss
was
a
funeral
dirge
leading
the
way
to
the
tomb
but
you
held
my
hand
at
parting
and
i
smiled
back
a
gay
good
night
and
you
never
knew
of
the
ghastly
corpse
i
was
hiding
away
from
your
sight
yet
whenever
i
hear
the
danube
under
its
pulsing
strain
i
catch
the
wail
of
the
funeral
dirge
and
my
heart
dies
over
again
not
anchored
my
heart
is
like
a
ship
that
finds
no
rest
tossed
here
and
there
upon
the
stormy
breast
of
loves
of
many
hearts
too
oft
conferred
thy
love
is
like
the
harbour
safe
and
still
into
whose
calm
that
ship
may
glide
at
will
under
the
slope
of
god
eternal
will
so
near
the
perfect
peace
that
knows
no
word
yet
with
an
empty
white
emotion
stirred
it
folds
its
wings
like
some
contented
bird
at
rest
and
yet
not
and
some
day
out
of
the
restful
peace
of
this
calm
bay
the
winds
of
fate
will
drift
it
far
away
the
new
love
i
thought
my
heart
was
death
chilled
i
thought
its
fires
were
cold
but
the
new
love
the
new
love
it
warmeth
like
the
old
i
thought
its
rooms
were
shadowed
with
the
gloom
of
endless
night
but
the
new
love
the
new
love
it
fills
them
full
of
light
i
thought
the
chambers
empty
and
proclaimed
it
unto
men
but
the
new
love
the
new
love
it
peoples
them
again
i
thought
its
halls
were
silent
and
hushed
the
whole
day
long
but
the
new
love
the
new
love
it
fills
them
full
of
song
then
here
is
to
the
new
love
let
who
will
sing
the
old
the
new
love
the
new
love
is
more
than
fame
or
gold
for
it
gives
us
joy
for
sorrow
and
it
gives
us
warmth
for
cold
oh
the
new
love
the
new
love
is
better
than
the
old
an
east
wind
the
glitter
of
wheels
far
down
the
street
ah
me
and
alack
a
day
and
i
heard
the
thud
of
his
horse
feet
beating
a
roundelay
and
i
felt
a
little
song
coming
coming
over
my
lips
as
humming
humming
i
turned
my
eyes
that
way
somebody
passed
who
was
wont
to
pause
ah
me
and
alack
a
day
he
bowed
and
smiled
yet
for
some
cause
the
mirth
went
out
of
my
lay
a
wind
from
the
east
rose
sighing
sighing
i
felt
my
little
song
dying
dying
laughed
as
they
rode
cheating
time
kiss
me
sweetheart
one
by
one
swift
and
sure
the
moments
run
soon
too
soon
for
you
and
me
gone
for
aye
the
day
will
be
do
not
let
time
cheat
us
then
kiss
me
often
and
again
every
time
a
moment
slips
let
us
count
it
on
our
lips
while
we
kissing
strife
and
pain
can
not
come
between
us
twain
if
we
pause
too
long
a
space
who
can
tell
what
may
take
place
you
may
pout
and
i
may
scold
souls
be
sundered
hearts
grow
cold
death
may
come
and
love
take
wings
oh
a
thousand
cruel
things
may
creep
in
to
spoil
the
day
if
we
throw
the
time
away
let
us
time
the
cheater
cheat
kiss
me
darling
kiss
me
sweet
only
a
slight
flirtation
just
a
slight
flirtation
and
where
the
harm
i
pray
in
that
amusing
pastime
so
much
in
vogue
her
hand
was
plighted
elsewhere
to
one
she
held
most
dear
but
why
should
she
sit
lonely
when
other
men
were
near
they
walked
to
church
together
they
sat
upon
the
shore
she
found
him
entertaining
he
found
her
something
more
they
rambled
in
the
moonlight
it
made
her
look
so
fair
she
let
him
praise
her
beauty
and
kiss
her
flowing
hair
was
just
a
nice
flirtation
sad
the
fellow
died
was
drowned
one
day
while
boating
the
week
she
was
a
bride
a
life
went
out
in
darkness
a
mother
fond
heart
broke
a
maiden
pined
in
secret
with
grief
she
never
spoke
while
robed
in
bridal
whiteness
queen
of
a
festal
throng
she
moved
whose
slight
flirtation
had
wrought
this
triple
wrong
what
the
rain
saw
winds
of
the
summer
time
what
are
you
saying
what
are
ye
seeking
and
what
do
you
miss
locks
like
the
thistledown
floating
and
straying
cheeks
like
the
budding
rose
tinted
to
kiss
see
ye
yon
mist
rising
up
from
the
river
that
is
the
spirit
of
yesterday
rain
go
to
it
fly
to
it
call
to
it
cry
to
it
what
did
ye
see
when
ye
fell
on
the
plain
rosewood
and
velvet
and
pansies
and
roses
blossoms
from
loving
hands
tenderly
cast
lids
like
the
leaves
of
a
lily
that
closes
after
its
brief
little
is
past
beautiful
hands
on
a
beautiful
bosom
folded
so
quietly
folded
in
rest
mouth
like
the
bud
of
a
blossom
creased
where
the
lips
of
an
angel
had
pressed
lower
and
lower
and
lower
and
lower
dust
unto
dust
but
a
mound
on
the
plain
left
alone
lonely
this
and
this
only
saw
we
and
see
we
said
the
rain
winds
of
the
summer
time
vain
is
your
seeking
vain
is
your
calling
with
sobs
in
your
breath
lips
that
are
tender
eyes
full
of
splendour
wooed
away
sued
away
vanished
with
death
after
after
the
end
that
is
drawing
near
comes
and
i
no
more
see
your
face
worn
with
suffering
lying
here
what
shall
i
do
with
the
empty
place
you
are
so
weary
that
if
i
could
i
would
not
hinder
i
would
not
keep
the
great
creator
of
all
things
good
from
giving
his
own
beloved
sleep
but
over
and
over
i
turn
this
thought
after
they
bear
you
away
to
the
tomb
and
banish
the
glasses
and
move
the
cot
what
shall
i
do
with
the
empty
room
and
when
you
are
lying
at
rest
my
own
hidden
away
in
the
grass
and
flowers
and
i
listen
in
vain
for
your
sigh
and
moan
what
shall
i
do
with
the
silent
hours
o
god
o
god
in
the
great
to
be
what
canst
thou
give
me
to
compensate
for
the
terrible
silence
the
vacancy
grim
and
awful
and
desolate
passing
away
my
beautiful
one
out
of
the
old
life
into
the
new
but
when
it
is
over
and
all
is
done
god
of
the
merciful
what
shall
i
do
sweetest
of
slumber
and
soundest
rest
no
more
sorrow
and
no
more
gloom
i
am
quite
contented
and
all
is
best
the
empty
bed
and
the
silent
our
petty
cares
our
petty
cares
wear
on
us
so
more
cruel
than
our
great
despairs
more
rasping
than
a
mighty
woe
our
petty
cares
less
need
of
strength
hath
he
who
bears
courageously
some
stinging
blow
of
fate
which
takes
him
unawares
not
solitary
griefs
we
know
induce
old
age
and
whitening
hairs
but
that
malicious
endless
row
our
petty
cares
the
ship
and
the
boat
in
the
great
ship
life
we
speed
along
with
sails
and
pennons
spread
and
tethered
beside
the
great
ship
glide
the
mystic
boats
for
the
dead
over
the
deck
of
the
ship
of
life
our
loved
and
lost
we
lower
and
calm
and
steady
his
small
boat
ready
death
silently
sits
at
the
oar
he
rows
our
dead
away
from
our
sight
away
from
our
hearing
or
ken
we
call
and
cry
for
a
last
but
they
never
come
back
again
the
ship
of
life
bounds
on
and
on
the
river
of
time
runs
fast
and
yet
more
swift
our
dear
dead
drift
for
ever
back
into
the
past
we
do
not
forget
those
loved
and
lost
but
they
fade
away
like
a
dream
as
we
hurry
along
on
the
current
strong
of
time
great
turbulent
stream
on
and
on
and
ever
away
our
sails
are
filled
by
the
wind
we
see
new
places
we
meet
new
faces
and
the
dead
are
far
behind
their
boats
have
drifted
into
the
sea
that
laves
god
holy
feet
but
the
river
course
too
seeks
that
source
so
the
ship
and
the
boat
shall
meet
come
near
come
near
to
me
i
need
thy
glorious
presence
through
the
dense
darkness
of
this
troubled
hour
shine
on
my
soul
and
fill
it
with
the
essence
of
thy
pervading
and
uplifting
power
come
near
come
near
to
me
come
nearer
yet
i
have
no
strength
to
reach
thee
my
soul
is
like
a
bird
with
broken
wings
lean
down
from
thy
fair
height
of
peace
and
teach
me
the
balm
thy
touch
to
mortal
bruises
brings
lean
down
o
god
lean
down
come
near
and
yet
if
those
eternal
places
hold
greater
tasks
to
occupy
thy
hands
send
thy
blest
angels
whose
celestial
faces
smile
sometimes
on
us
from
the
spirit
lands
send
one
send
one
to
me
i
must
have
help
i
am
so
weak
and
broken
i
can
not
help
myself
i
know
not
how
that
moral
force
of
which
so
much
is
spoken
will
not
sustain
or
fortify
me
now
i
must
i
must
have
help
some
outside
aid
some
strength
from
spirit
sources
we
all
must
have
in
hours
like
this
or
die
to
one
or
all
of
those
mysterious
forces
which
men
call
god
i
lift
my
voice
and
cry
come
near
come
near
to
me
a
suggestion
as
i
go
and
shop
sir
if
a
car
i
stop
sir
where
you
chance
to
sit
and
you
want
to
read
sir
never
mind
or
heed
sir
i
not
care
a
bit
for
it
now
aesthetic
to
be
quite
athletic
that
our
fad
you
know
i
can
hold
the
strap
sir
and
keep
off
your
lap
sir
as
we
jolting
go
if
you
read
on
blindly
i
shall
take
it
kindly
all
the
car
not
mine
but
if
you
sit
and
stare
sir
at
my
eyes
and
hair
sir
i
must
draw
the
line
if
the
stare
is
meant
sir
for
a
compliment
sir
as
we
jog
through
town
allow
me
to
suggest
sir
a
woman
oft
looks
best
sir
when
she
sitting
down
a
fisherman
baby
oh
hush
little
baby
thy
papa
at
sea
the
big
billows
rock
him
as
mama
rocks
thee
he
hastes
to
his
dear
ones
breakers
of
foam
then
hush
little
darling
till
papa
comes
home
sleep
little
baby
hush
little
baby
papa
is
coming
no
longer
to
roam
the
shells
and
the
pebbles
all
day
tossed
about
are
lulled
into
sleep
by
the
tide
ebbing
out
the
weary
shore
slumbers
stretched
out
in
the
sand
while
the
waves
hurry
off
at
mid
ocean
command
then
hush
little
baby
sleep
little
darling
sleep
baby
rocked
by
thy
mother
own
hand
the
winds
that
have
rollicked
all
day
in
the
west
are
soothed
into
sleep
on
the
calm
evening
breast
the
boats
that
were
out
with
the
wild
sea
at
play
are
now
rocked
to
sleep
in
the
arms
of
the
bay
then
rest
little
baby
sleep
little
baby
papa
will
come
at
the
break
of
the
day
content
and
happiness
how
is
it
that
men
pray
their
earthly
lot
may
be
and
happiness
dire
foes
without
one
common
trait
which
kinship
shows
i
hold
these
two
contentment
comes
when
sought
while
happiness
pursued
was
never
caught
but
sudden
storms
the
heart
with
mighty
throes
whenceforth
mild
eyed
content
affrighted
goes
to
seek
some
calmer
heart
less
danger
fraught
bold
happiness
knows
but
one
rival
fear
who
follows
ever
on
his
footsteps
sent
by
jealous
fate
who
calls
great
joy
a
crime
while
in
far
ways
leaves
just
turning
sere
with
gaze
serene
and
placid
walks
content
no
heart
ere
held
these
two
guests
at
one
time
the
cusine
the
woman
who
looks
upon
man
as
a
sinner
unsaved
as
to
soul
and
uncertain
in
heart
should
learn
how
to
cook
and
prepare
him
a
dinner
and
serve
it
with
talent
refinement
and
art
full
many
a

by

appeal

heart
you

would
you
reach
to
the
last
to
the
first
you
must
stoop
i
wonder
why
do
you
remember
that
glorious
june
when
we
were
lovers
you
and
i
something
there
was
in
the
robin
tune
something
there
was
in
earth
and
sky
that
was
never
before
and
never
since
then
i
wonder
why
do
you
remember
the
bridge
we
crossed
and
lingered
to
see
the
ships
go
by
with
snowy
sails
to
the
free
winds
tossed
i
never
pass
that
bridge
but
i
sigh
with
a
sense
at
my
heart
as
of
something
lost
i
wonder
why
do
you
remember
the
song
we
sung
under
the
beautiful
starlit
sky
the
world
was
bright
and
our
hearts
were
young
i
can
not
forget
though
i
try
and
try
how
you
smiled
in
my
eyes
while
the
echoes
rung
i
wonder
why
do
you
remember
how
debonair
the
new
moon
shone
when
we
said
how
it
listened
and
smiled
when
we
parted
there
i
shall
hate
the
new
moon
until
i
die
hate
it
for
ever
nor
think
it
fair
i
wonder
why
a
woman
hand
all
day
long
there
has
haunted
me
a
spectre
out
of
my
lost
because
i
happened
last
night
to
see
a
woman
beautiful
hand
like
part
of
a
statue
broken
away
and
carefully
kept
in
a
velvet
case
on
the
crimson
rim
of
her
box
it
lay
the
folds
of
the
curtain
hid
her
face
years
had
drifted
between
us
two
in
another
clime
in
another
land
we
had
lived
and
parted
and
yet
i
knew
that
cruelly
beautiful
perfect
hand
the
ringless
beauty
of
fingers
fine
the
tint
of
their
taper
tips
the
sight
of
them
stirred
my
blood
like
wine
oh
to
hold
them
again
to
my
lips
to
feel
their
tender
touch
on
my
hair
their
mute
caress
and
their
clinging
hold
oh
for
the
past
that
was
green
and
fair
with
a
cloudless
sky
and
a
sun
of
gold
but
the
sun
has
set
and
a
dead
delight
shadows
my
life
with
a
dull
despair
oh
why
did
i
see
that
hand
of
white
like
a
marble
ornament
lying
there
presentiment
as
unseen
spheres
cast
shadows
on
the
earth
some
unknown
cause
depresses
me
the
house
is
full
of
laughter
and
sweet
mirth
the
day
has
held
but
pleasure
and
delight
down
in
the
parlour
some
one
blithely
sings
a
chime
of
laughter
echoes
in
the
hall
but
all
unseen
by
other
eyes
strange
things
do
seem
to
glide
along
the
wall
i
rise
and
laugh
and
say
i
will
not
care
i
call
them
idle
fancies
one
and
all
and
yet
suspended
by
a
single
hair
the
sword
of
fate
seems
trembling
soon
to
fall
i
leave
the
house
and
walk
the
lighted
street
and
mingle
with
the
throng
and
close
behind
me
follow
spectre
feet
that
pause
with
me
or
with
me
move
along
i
seek
my
room
and
close
and
bolt
the
door
i
draw
the
curtain
and
turn
up
the
light
but
close
beside
me
closer
than
before
this
nameless
stands
but
out
of
sight
ye
mystic
messenger
of
woe
to
come
ye
nameless
nothing
called
take
form
and
face
me
be
no
longer
dumb
but
tell
who
thou
art
and
wherefore
sent
two
rooms
one
room
is
full
of
luxury
and
dim
with
that
soft
moonlit
radiance
of
light
that
she
best
loves
who
sits
and
dreams
of
him
her
heart
has
crowned
as
knight
and
one
is
bare
and
comfortless
and
dim
with
that
strange
fitful
glimmer
that
is
shed
by
candles
casting
shadows
weird
and
grim
above
the
sheeted
dead
in
one
a
round
and
beautiful
young
face
is
full
of
wordless
rapture
and
so
fair
you
know
her
breast
is
joy
best
you
know
sweet
love
is
there
in
one
there
lies
a
white
and
wasted
face
whereon
is
frozen
such
supreme
despair
you
need
but
look
to
know
what
left
the
trace
you
know
love
there
to
one
he
comes
she
leans
her
head
of
gold
upon
his
breast
and
bids
him
no
more
roam
ah
god
ah
god
and
one
lies
stark
and
cold
because
he
ceased
to
come
three
at
the
opera
last
night
the
house
was
crowded
were
you
there
you
thought
our
box
held
only
two
maybe
myself
and
chaperon
a
matron
fair
there
was
another
whom
you
did
not
see
close
close
beside
me
sat
a
phantom
form
above
the
music
and
loud
cheer
on
cheer
that
rose
and
thundered
like
a
sudden
storm
i
heard
his
low
voice
whispering
in
my
ear
a
dead
man
voice
you
know
when
dead
men
speak
there
is
no
noise
their
least
tone
will
not
drown
his
sweet
soft
words
brought
blushes
to
my
cheek
and
made
my
happy
eyelids
flutter
down
there
were
so
many
glasses
turned
on
me
my
chaperon
was
proud
she
called
me
fair
and
said
i
drew
their
glances
well
may
be
think
they
saw
that
dead
man
sitting
there
a
dead
man
at
an
opera
how
strange
i
know
it
must
have
seemed
much
out
of
place
he
smiled
and
spoke
and
there
was
little
change
in
the
white
pallor
of
his
perfect
face
yet
he
was
dead
i
knew
it
all
the
while
i
do
not
wonder
people
looked
that
way
it
seemed
so
odd
to
see
a
dead
man
smile
its
strangeness
never
struck
me
till
he
rose
and
went
out
when
we
left
our
stall
rose
up
went
out
and
vanished
in
the
night
he
always
sits
beside
me
in
that
hall
but
goes
when
goes
the
music
and
the
light
a
strain
of
music
in
through
the
open
window
to
the
chamber
where
i
lay
there
came
the
beat
of
merry
feet
from
the
dancers
over
the
way
and
back
on
the
wings
of
the
music
that
rose
on
the
midnight
air
my
rare
youth
came
and
spoke
my
name
and
lo
i
was
young
and
fair
once
more
in
the
glitter
of
gaslight
i
stood
in
my
life
glad
prime
and
heart
and
feet
in
a
rhythm
sweet
were
keeping
the
music
time
like
a
leaf
in
the
breeze
of
summer
i
drifted
down
the
hall
on
an
arm
that
is
cold
with
death
and
mould
and
is
hidden
under
the
pall
once
more
at
a
low
voice
whisper
a
voice
that
is
long
since
stilled
i
felt
the
flush
of
a
rising
blush
and
my
pulses
leaped
and
thrilled
once
more
in
a
sea
of
faces
i
only
saw
one
face
and
life
grew
bright
with
a
new
delight
and
sweet
with
a
nameless
grace
a
crash
of
passionate
music
a
hush
and
a
silence
then
the
dancers
rest
in
their
pleasure
quest
and
lo
i
am
old
again
old
and
alone
in
my
chamber
while
the
night
wears
wearily
on
and
the
pallid
wraith
of
a
broken
faith
keeps
watch
with
me
till
the
dawn
smoke
last
summer
lazing
by
the
sea
i
met
a
most
entrancing
creature
her
black
eyes
quite
bewildered
me
she
had
a
spanish
cast
of
feature
she
often
smoked
a
cigarette
and
did
it
in
the
cutest
fashion
before
a
week
passed
by
she
set
my
young
heart
in
a
raging
passion
i
swore
i
loved
her
as
my
life
i
gave
her
gems
do
tell
my
tailor
she
promised
to
become
my
wife
but
whispered
is
my
jailer
must
be
very
sly
you
see
for
papa
will
not
list
to
reason
you
must
not
come
to
call
on
me
until
he
gone
from
home
a
season
send
you
word
now
do
forget
take
this
as
pledge
i
will
remember
she
gave
me
a
perfumed
cigarette
and
turned
and
left
me
with
september
she
sent
her
to
me
presence
asked
to
see
her
marry
that
millionaire
old
banker
c
she
my
so
i
tarry
and
still
i
feel
a
keen
regret
about
the
jewels
that
i
gave
her
i
smoked
the
little
cigarette
it
had
a
most
delicious
flavour
an
autumn
day
leaden
skies
and
a
lonesome
shadow
where
summer
has
passed
with
her
gorgeous
train
snow
on
the
mountain
and
frost
on
the
meadow
a
white
face
pressed
to
the
window
pane
a
cold
mist
falling
a
bleak
wind
calling
and
oh
but
life
seems
vain
rain
is
better
than
golden
weather
when
the
heart
is
dulled
with
a
dumb
despair
dead
leaves
lie
where
they
walked
together
the
hammock
is
gone
and
the
rustic
chair
let
bleak
snows
cover
the
whole
world
over
it
will
never
again
seem
fair
time
laughs
lightly
at
youth
sad
summer
shall
come
again
smiling
once
more
high
the
cold
world
the
sun
shines
for
ever
hearts
that
seemed
dead
are
alive
at
the
core
oh
but
the
pain
of
it
oh
but
the
gain
of
it
after
the
shadows
pass
wishes
whatever
you
want
if
you
wish
for
it
long
with
constant
yearning
and
fervent
desire
if
your
wish
soars
upward
on
wings
so
strong
that
they
never
grow
languid
and
never
tire
why
over
the
storm
clouds
and
out
of
the
dark
it
shall
come
flying
some
day
to
you
as
the
dove
with
the
olive
branch
flew
to
the
ark
and
the
dream
you
have
cherished
it
shall
come
true
but
lest
much
rapture
shall
make
you
mad
or
too
bright
sunshine
should
strike
you
blind
along
with
your
blessing
a
something
sad
shall
come
like
a
shadow
that
follows
behind
something
unwelcome
and
unforeseen
yet
of
your
hope
and
your
wish
a
part
shall
stand
like
a
sentinel
in
between
the
perfect
joy
and
the
human
heart
i
wished
for
a
cloudless
and
golden
day
it
came
but
i
looked
from
my
window
to
see
a
giant
shadow
which
seemed
to
say
you
ask
for
the
sunlight
you
must
take
me
oh
a
wonderful
thing
is
the
human
will
when
seeking
one
purpose
and
serving
one
end
but
i
think
it
is
wiser
to
just
sit
still
and
accept
whatever
the
gods
may
send
the
play
in
the
rosy
light
of
my
day
fair
morning
ere
ever
a
storm
cloud
darkened
the
west
ere
even
a
shadow
of
night
gave
warning
when
life
seemed
only
a
pleasure
quest
why
then
all
humour
and
comedy
scorning
i
liked
high
tragedy
best
i
liked
the
challenge
the
fierce
fought
duel
with
a
death
or
a
parting
in
every
act
i
liked
the
villain
to
be
more
cruel
than
the
basest
villain
could
be
in
fact
for
it
fed
the
fires
of
my
mind
with
the
fuel
of
the
things
that
my
life
lacked
but
as
time
passed
on
and
i
met
real
sorrow
and
she
played
at
night
on
the
stage
my
heart
i
found
i
could
not
forget
on
the
morrow
the
pain
i
had
felt
in
her
tragic
part
for
alas
no
longer
i
needed
to
borrow
my
grief
from
the
actor
art
and
as
life
grows
older
and
therefore
sadder
though
sweeter
maybe
with
its
autumn
haze
i
find
more
pleasure
in
watching
the
gladder
and
lighter
order
of
humorous
plays
where
the
mirth
is
as
mad
or
maybe
madder
than
the
mirth
of
my
lost
days
i
like
to
be
forced
to
laugh
and
be
merry
though
the
earth
with
sorrow
and
pain
is
rife
i
like
for
an
evening
at
least
to
bury
all
thoughts
of
trouble
or
pain
or
strife
in
sooth
i
like
to
be
moved
to
the
very
emotions
i
miss
in
life
as
we
look
back
rondeau
as
we
look
back
at
our
lost
light
that
never
was
on
land
or
touches
the
distant
mountain
peaks
with
gold
and
through
the
glass
of
memory
we
behold
such
blossoms
as
grow
not
on
any
lea
the
double
leaf
upon
the
poplar
tree
turns
up
its
silver
side
to
you
and
me
and
lanterns
light
the
lonely
wold
as
we
look
back
no
sounds
we
hear
but
echoes
of
young
glee
no
winds
we
feel
but
west
winds
blowing
free
from
those
fair
isles
that
seem
a
thousandfold
more
beautiful
than
in
the
days
of
old
and
all
the
clouds
that
hang
above
them
flee
as
we
look
back
why
why
do
eyes
that
were
tender
averted
turn
away
why
has
our
dear
love
splendour
all
faded
into
gray
why
is
it
that
lips
glow
not
that
late
were
all
aglow
i
know
not
dear
i
know
not
i
only
know
is
so
why
do
you
no
more
tremble
now
when
i
kiss
your
cheek
why
do
we
both
dissemble
the
thoughts
we
used
to
speak
why
is
it
that
words
flow
not
that
used
to
fondly
flow
i
know
not
dear
i
know
not
i
only
know
is
so
have
we
outlived
the
passion
that
late
lit
earth
and
sky
and
is
this
but
the
fashion
a
fond
love
takes
to
die
is
it
that
we
shall
know
not
again
love
rapture
glow
i
trust
not
sweet
i
trust
not
and
yet
it
may
be
so
listen
whoever
you
are
as
you
read
this
whatever
your
trouble
or
grief
i
want
you
to
know
and
to
heed
this
the
day
draweth
near
with
relief
no
sorrow
no
woe
is
unending
though
heaven
seems
voiceless
and
dumb
remember
your
cry
is
ascending
and
an
answer
will
certainly
come
whatever
temptation
is
near
you
whose
eyes
on
this
simple
verse
fall
remember
good
angels
will
hear
you
and
help
you
so
sure
as
you
call
who
stunned
with
despair
i
beseech
you
whatever
your
losses
your
need
believe
when
these
printed
words
reach
you
believe
you
were
born
to
succeed
together
we
two
in
the
fever
and
fervour
and
glow
of
life
high
tide
have
rejoiced
together
we
have
looked
out
over
the
glittering
snow
and
known
we
were
dwelling
in
summer
weather
for
the
seasons
are
made
by
the
heart
i
hold
and
not
by
the
outdoor
heat
or
cold
we
two
in
the
shadows
of
pain
and
fear
have
journeyed
together
in
dim
dark
places
where
sorrow
walked
to
and
fro
and
fear
and
trouble
with
phantom
faces
peered
out
upon
us
and
froze
our
blood
though
june
fair
roses
were
all
in
bud
we
two
have
measured
all
depths
all
heights
we
have
bathed
in
tears
we
have
sunned
in
laughter
we
have
known
all
sorrow
and
all
delights
they
never
could
keep
us
apart
hereafter
wherever
your
spirit
was
sent
i
know
i
would
find
my
way
in
the
dark
and
go
if
they
took
my
soul
into
paradise
and
told
me
i
must
be
content
without
you
i
would
weary
them
so
with
my
homesick
cries
and
the
ceaseless
questions
i
asked
about
you
they
would
open
the
gates
and
set
me
free
or
else
they
would
find
you
and
bring
you
to
me
one
night
was
it
last
summer
or
ages
gone
that
damp
dark
night
in
the
august
dusk
when
i
waited
for
you
by
the
gate
alone
and
the
air
was
heavy
with
scents
like
musk
swiftly
and
silently
shooting
down
like
the
lonesome
light
of
a
falling
star
i
saw
through
the
shadows
dense
and
brown
the
dull
red
light
of
your
fine
cigar
like
a
king
who
taketh
his
own
you
came
through
the
lowering
night
and
the
falling
dew
like
one
who
yields
to
a
rightful
claim
i
waited
there
in
the
dusk
for
you
never
again
when
the
day
grows
late
never
again
in
the
years
to
be
shall
i
stand
in
the
dark
and
dew
and
wait
and
never
again
will
you
come
to
me
but
always
and
ever
when
high
and
far
the
old
moon
hideth
her
troubled
face
i
think
how
the
light
like
a
falling
star
lit
all
my
world
with
a
new
strange
grace
the
passionate
glow
of
your
splendid
eyes
shines
into
my
heart
as
it
shone
that
night
and
its
slumberous
billows
surge
and
rise
as
the
ocean
is
stirred
by
the
tempest
might
lost
nation
oh
we
are
a
lone
lost
nation
we
who
sing
your
songs
with
his
moods
and
his
desolation
the
poet
nowhere
belongs
we
are
not
of
the
people
who
labour
believe
and
doubt
like
the
bell
that
rings
in
the
steeple
we
are
in
the
world
yet
out
in
the
rustic
town
or
the
city
we
seek
our
place
in
vain
and
our
hearts
are
starved
for
pity
and
our
souls
are
sick
with
pain
yes
the
people
are
buying
selling
and
the
world
is
one
great
mart
and
woe
for
the
thoughts
that
are
dwelling
up
in
the
poet
heart
we
know
what
the
waves
are
saying
as
they
roll
up
from
the
sea
and
the
weird
old
wind
is
playing
our
own
sad
melody
we
send
forth
a
song
to
wander
like
a
spirit
of
ill
or
good
and
here
it
is
heard
and
yonder
but
is
nowhere
understood
for
the
world
it
lives
for
fashion
for
glory
and
gain
and
strife
and
what
can
it
know
of
the
passion
and
pain
of
a
poet
life
the
captive
my
lady
is
robed
for
the
ball
all
in
a
shimmer
and
silken
sheen
she
glides
down
the
stairs
like
a
thing
of
light
the
ballroom
beautiful
queen
priceless
gems
on
her
bosom
glow
half
hid
by
laces
a
queen
might
wear
robed
is
she
as
befits
you
know
the
wife
of
a
millionaire
gliding
along
at
her
liege
lord
side
all
in
that
company
into
the
mind
of
the
old
man
bride
there
creeps
a
curious
simile
she
thinks
how
once
in
the
long
ago
a
beautiful
captive
all
aflame
with
jewels
that
weighed
her
down
like
woe
close
in
the
wake
of
her
captor
came
all
day
long
in
that
mocking
plight
she
followed
him
in
a
dumb
despair
and
the
people
thought
her
a
goodly
sight
decked
in
her
jewels
rare
and
now
at
her
lawful
master
side
with
a
pain
in
her
heart
as
great
as
then
so
thinks
this
old
man
beautiful
bride
zenobia
walks
again
no
song
these
summer
days
when
all
the
poets
sing
i
have
no
voice
for
song
i
see
the
birds
of
summer
taking
wing
and
days
so
sweet
and
long
each
seemed
a
little
heaven
with
no
end
i
know
are
gone
for
evermore
dear
friend
nay
by
and
by
comes
another
spring
and
long
sweet
perfect
days
and
by
and
by
i
shall
have
voice
to
sing
my
old
glad
happy
lays
more
blithesome
songs
more
days
that
have
no
end
more
golden
summers
but
no
friend
two
friends
one
day
ambition
in
his
endless
round
all
filled
with
vague
and
nameless
longings
found
slow
wasting
genius
who
from
spot
to
spot
went
idly
grazing
through
the
realms
of
thought
ambition
cried
wander
forth
with
me
i
like
thy
face
but
can
not
stay
with
thee
will
said
genius
i
needs
must
own
i
getting
dull
by
being
much
alone
hands
are
cold
come
warm
them
at
my
fire
ambition
said
what
is
thy
desire
quoth
genius
neath
the
sod
of
yonder
heather
lie
gems
untold
let
plough
them
out
together
they
bent
like
strong
young
oxen
to
the
plough
this
done
ambition
questioned
now
we
leave
these
gems
for
all
the
world
to
see
new
sports
and
pleasures
wait
for
thee
and
me
said
genius
ghostly
ruin
stands
a
blot
and
blemish
on
surrounding
lands
let
fling
sweet
blooming
fancies
everywhere
soon
all
the
world
in
wonder
came
to
stare
come
ambition
cried
do
be
gone
from
this
dull
place
i
would
go
further
on
lies
said
genius
on
yonder
peak
a
prize
alone
i
have
not
cared
to
seek
up
up
they
went
as
swift
as
sure
as
time
they
seemed
to
soar
in
truth
they
did
but
climb
and
there
in
sight
of
all
the
world
beneath
ambition
crowned
fair
genius
with
a
wreath
all
day
they
journeyed
swift
from
place
to
place
ambition
led
and
genius
joined
the
chase
in
every
realm
of
fancy
or
of
thought
all
depths
they
sounded
and
all
heights
they
sought
now
hand
in
hand
for
evermore
they
stray
and
if
they
part
or
quarrel
for
a
day
you
find
ambition
aimless
reckless
wild
and
genius
moping
like
an
idle
child
i
did
think
if
all
the
troubles
in
the
world
were
traced
back
to
their
start
we
find
not
one
in
ten
begun
from
want
of
willing
heart
but
there
a
sly
elf
who
lurks
about
youth
brink
and
sure
dismay
he
brings
alway
the
elf
did
think
he
seems
so
sorry
when
he
caught
his
mien
is
all
contrite
he
so
regrets
the
woe
he
wrought
and
wants
to
make
things
right
but
wishes
do
not
heal
a
wound
or
weld
a
broken
link
the
heart
aches
on
the
link
is
gone
all
through
did
think
i
half
believe
that
ugly
sprite
bold
wicked
do
care
in
life
long
run
less
harm
has
done
because
he
is
so
rare
and
one
can
be
so
stern
with
him
can
make
the
monster
shrink
but
lack
a
day
what
can
we
say
to
whining
think
this
most
unpleasant
imp
of
strife
pursues
us
everywhere
there
scarcely
one
whole
day
of
life
he
does
not
cause
us
care
small
woes
and
great
he
brings
the
world
strong
ships
are
forced
to
sink
and
trains
from
iron
track
are
hurled
alack
by
stupid
think
when
brain
is
comrade
to
the
heart
and
heart
from
soul
draws
grace
did
think
will
quick
depart
for
lack
of
if
from
that
great
unselfish
stream
the
golden
rule
we
drink
we
keep
god
laws
and
have
no
cause
to
say
did
think
a
burial
i
had
a
burial
of
my
dead
there
was
no
shroud
no
coffin
and
no
pall
no
prayers
were
uttered
and
no
tears
were
shed
i
only
turned
a
picture
to
the
wall
a
picture
that
had
hung
within
my
room
for
years
and
years
a
relic
of
my
youth
it
kept
the
rose
of
love
in
constant
bloom
to
see
those
eyes
of
earnestness
and
truth
at
hours
wherein
no
other
dared
intrude
i
had
drawn
comfort
from
its
smiling
grace
silent
companion
of
my
solitude
my
soul
held
sweet
communion
with
that
face
i
lived
again
the
dream
so
bright
so
brief
though
wakened
as
we
all
are
by
some
fate
this
picture
gave
me
infinite
relief
and
did
not
leave
me
wholly
desolate
i
saw
an
item
quite
by
chance
that
robbed
me
of
my
pitiful
poor
dole
a
marriage
notice
fell
beneath
my
glance
and
i
became
a
lonely
widowed
soul
with
drooping
eyes
and
cheeks
a
burning
flame
i
turned
the
picture
to
the
blank
wall
gloom
my
very
heart
had
died
in
me
of
shame
if
i
had
left
it
smiling
in
my
room
another
woman
husband
so
my
friend
my
comfort
my
sole
relic
of
the
past
i
bury
thee
and
lonely
seek
the
end
swift
age
has
swept
my
youth
from
me
at
last
their
faces
o
beautiful
white
angels
who
control
the
inner
workings
of
each
poet
soul
thou
who
hast
touched
my
mind
with
tender
graces
come
near
to
me
that
i
may
see
thy
faces
me
didst
thou
bless
before
i
came
to
earth
me
hast
thou
kissed
and
dowered
at
my
birth
with
such
a
wealth
of
sweet
imaginings
that
even
in
sleep
my
dreaming
fancy
sings
sometimes
when
seeing
clouds
at
noon
or
watching
silver
shadows
from
the
moon
within
my
soul
has
stirred
a
joy
like
fear
as
if
some
kindred
spirit
lingered
near
come
closer
angels
thou
whose
haloed
wings
do
gild
for
me
the
meanest
ways
and
things
with
beauty
borrowed
from
the
infinite
stand
forth
let
me
behold
thee
in
the
light
o
thought
supreme
o
death
o
life
unknown
i
shall
not
solve
thy
mystery
alone
the
angels
who
have
kissed
me
at
my
birth
shall
take
again
my
soul
when
done
with
earth
and
as
we
soar
through
vast
spaces
at
last
at
last
i
shall
behold
their
faces
the
lullaby
when
the
long
day
leans
to
the
twilight
when
the
evening
star
climbs
to
the
moon
with
a
heart
that
is
silently
breaking
i
sit
in
the
gloaming
and
croon
i
croon
a
low
song
for
my
darling
my
wee
one
my
baby
my
own
who
cradled
in
rosewood
and
velvet
sleeps
out
in
the
churchyard
alone
alone
with
no
arms
to
enfold
her
alone
with
no
pillowing
breast
alone
with
no
hand
on
her
cradle
to
rock
her
to
soundlier
rest
but
each
day
in
the
hush
of
the
twilight
is
silenced
my
broken
heart
cry
and
i
sit
where
i
sat
with
my
darling
and
sing
her
the
old
lullaby
oh
the
dreams
that
come
back
to
me
mocking
the
sorrow
that
makes
the
days
long
as
i
sit
in
the
twilight
there
rocking
and
singing
that
lullaby
song
but
i
think
my
wee
darling
rests
better
as
the
night
shadows
lengthen
and
creep
across
her
low
bed
in
the
churchyard
if
her
mother
voice
sings
her
to
sleep
and
so
with
a
heart
that
is
breaking
i
sing
the
old
that
hushed
her
so
oft
into
slumber
o
baby
my
own
do
you
hear
mirage
when
the
beautiful
mountain
ash
is
turning
as
lovely
a
sight
as
the
eyes
desire
when
the
leaves
of
the
sumac
bush
are
burning
like
the
steady
flame
of
a
winter
fire
when
the
weeds
by
the
roadside
all
grow
golden
when
maples
are
glowing
and
asters
gleam
it
is
then
that
the
new
is
changed
to
the
olden
and
back
to
my
heart
comes
the
past
like
a
dream
like
a
mirage
i
see
the
blue
haze
me
the
city
of
youth
that
i
left
behind
oh
whitely
its
turrets
are
gleaming
before
me
and
out
of
the
window
lean
faces
kind
and
i
hear
the
echo
of
jubilant
voices
there
are
cheeks
of
beauty
and
eyes
of
truth
and
every
pulse
in
my
heart
rejoices
there
no
other
place
like
the
city
of
youth
and
lo
the
city
is
full
of
splendour
and
a
voice
in
my
soul
breaks
into
song
yes
a
passionate
love
as
fair
as
tender
creeps
out
of
the
grave
where
it
slept
so
long
as
the
strings
of
a
harp
by
winds
are
shaken
to
endless
music
my
heart
is
stirred
when
my
name
is
breathed
and
my
hand
is
taken
though
i
can
not
utter
a
single
word
but
with
souls
that
are
full
of
the
beautiful
weather
and
the
perfect
peace
that
has
no
name
under
the
autumn
skies
together
we
stray
by
the
sumacs
all
aflame
and
the
forest
flushes
to
fuller
glory
brighter
glow
asters
and
golden
rod
as
eye
unto
eye
tells
the
old
old
story
and
the
sunlight
seems
like
the
smile
of
god
alone
i
stand
and
sorrowful
hearted
the
dead
leaves
fall
in
the
chilly
wind
the
mirage
is
fled
and
the
glory
departed
and
the
city
of
youth
is
far
behind
alone
in
the
house
i
am
all
alone
in
the
house
they
would
not
have
gone
away
had
they
known
of
the
terrible
bloodless
fight
i
have
held
with
my
heart
with
the
old
sweet
love
and
the
old
fierce
pain
i
have
battled
hour
by
hour
but
the
fates
have
willed
that
the
strife
is
vain
alone
in
the
hour
my
thoughts
have
reign
and
i
yield
myself
to
their
power
yield
myself
to
the
old
time
charm
of
a
dream
of
vanished
bliss
the
thrill
of
a
voice
and
the
fold
of
an
arm
and
a
red
lip
lingering
kiss
it
all
comes
back
like
a
flowing
tide
that
brief
but
beautiful
day
though
it
oft
is
checked
by
the
dam
of
pride
till
the
waters
flow
back
to
the
other
side
it
has
broken
away
i
gave
you
all
that
i
had
to
give
o
love
the
lavish
whole
and
you
threw
it
away
and
now
i
live
a
starved
and
beggared
soul
and
i
feed
on
crumbs
that
memory
throws
from
her
table
and
i
lay
awake
when
others
repose
and
slake
my
thirst
when
no
one
knows
with
the
wine
that
she
has
spilled
i
go
my
way
and
i
do
my
part
in
the
world
great
scene
of
strife
but
i
do
it
all
with
an
empty
heart
dead
to
the
best
of
life
and
ofttimes
weary
and
tempest
tossed
when
i
am
not
ruled
by
pride
i
wish
ere
the
die
was
throne
and
lost
ere
i
played
for
love
without
counting
the
cost
that
i
like
my
heart
had
died
an
old
bouquet
i
opened
a
long
closed
drawer
and
among
the
souvenirs
stored
away
were
the
faded
leaves
of
an
old
bouquet
those
faded
leaves
were
as
white
as
snow
with
a
background
of
green
to
make
them
show
when
you
gave
them
to
me
long
years
ago
they
carried
me
back
in
a
flash
of
light
to
a
perfumed
perfect
summer
night
and
a
rider
who
came
on
a
steed
of
white
i
can
see
it
all
how
you
rode
down
like
a
knight
of
old
from
the
dusty
town
with
a
passionate
glow
in
your
eyes
of
brown
again
i
stand
by
the
garden
gate
while
the
golden
sun
slips
low
and
wait
and
watch
your
coming
my
love
my
fate
young
and
handsome
and
debonair
you
leap
to
my
side
in
the
garden
there
and
i
take
your
flowers
and
call
them
fair
out
of
the
west
the
glory
dies
as
we
stand
under
the
sunset
skies
with
love
in
our
hearts
and
love
in
our
eyes
love
too
tender
and
love
too
great
to
die
with
death
or
to
yield
to
fate
but
your
restless
steed
tells
the
hour
is
late
you
mount
him
again
and
you
ride
away
into
the
west
that
is
growing
gray
oh
turn
the
key
on
that
dear
bouquet
it
is
dry
and
faded
and
i
am
old
and
the
hand
that
gave
it
is
green
with
mould
and
the
winter
of
life
is
cold
so
cold
at
the
bridal
oh
but
the
bride
was
lovely
oh
but
the
scene
was
bright
and
why
was
the
bridegroom
face
as
pale
as
his
lady
robe
of
white
did
you
not
see
beside
him
a
guest
unasked
unbid
who
came
up
the
aisle
with
silent
feet
and
gazed
at
him
he
did
he
saw
her
eyes
upon
him
he
felt
her
icy
breath
and
under
the
bride
warm
clinging
hand
there
crept
the
touch
of
death
and
above
the
low
responses
there
fell
upon
his
ear
a
voice
forbidding
the
nuptial
banns
but
no
one
else
could
hear
and
when
the
ring
was
given
and
when
the
prayer
was
said
he
knew
as
he
led
his
bride
away
that
he
was
not
truly
and
while
they
sat
at
the
banquet
and
mirth
flowed
like
the
wine
a
dead
girl
voice
hissed
in
his
ear
are
not
hers
but
mine
oh
never
beside
his
hearthstone
and
never
in
any
place
shall
he
be
free
from
the
haunting
thought
of
that
accusing
face
best
in
the
gruesome
night
and
the
wintry
weather
i
watched
two
dear
friends
die
and
i
buried
them
both
in
one
grave
together
oh
who
is
so
sad
as
i
for
the
old
love
and
the
old
year
they
both
have
passed
away
and
i
never
can
find
the
old
cheer
come
what
will
or
may
i
heard
the
bell
in
the
tall
church
steeple
clang
out
a
joyful
strain
and
i
thought
all
the
great
world
people
i
have
the
bitterest
pain
for
the
old
year
was
a
good
year
and
the
old
love
was
sweet
and
how
could
my
heart
hold
any
cheer
when
both
lay
dead
at
my
feet
life
may
smile
and
the
skies
may
brighten
winter
will
pass
with
its
snows
grief
will
wane
and
the
burden
lighten
and
june
will
come
with
the
rose
but
it
can
not
bring
the
old
cheer
to
fill
my
empty
breast
for
the
old
year
was
the
one
year
and
the
old
love
was
best
