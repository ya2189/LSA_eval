the

i
there
lay
in
a
vale
lone
mountains
a
garden
entangled
with
flowers
where
the
whisper
of
echoing
fountains
stirred
softly
the
bowers
where
torrents
cast
down
from
from
caverns
of
steeps
with
thunders
sonorous
clove
passes
and
maddened
dark
gulfs
with
rash
leaps
with
the
dolorous
foam
of
their
leaps
ii
and
oh
when
the
sunrays
came
heaping
the
foam
of
those
musical
chasms
with
a
scintillant
dust
as
of
diamonds
it
seemed
that
white
spirits
were
sweeping
down
down
thro
those
voluble
chasms
wild
weeping
in
resonant
spasms
and
the
wave
from
the
granite
in
veins
rolled
tumbling
around
meandered
thro
forests
where
many
rock
barriers
did
span
it
to
dash
it
in
froth
and
in
sound
where
the
nights
with
their
great
moons
could
wan
it
or
star
its
dusk
stillness
profound
iii
and
here
in
the
night
would
i
wander
on
woodways
where
fragrances
kissed
by
shadows
where
murmurings
kissed
and
here
would
i
tarry
to
ponder
when
the
moon
in
blue
vales
made
a
mist
dim
in
forests
of
rank
rocking
cedars
whose
wildness
made
glad
with
their
scent
whose
boughs
in
the
tempests
were
bent
like
the
pennons
and
plumes
of
fierce
leaders
in
the
battle
all
ragged
and
rent
iv
and
so
when
the
moonshine
was
floating
far
up
on
the
mountain
bleak
head
on
the
uttermost
foam
of
the
torrent
would
i
string
a
wild
harp
while
was
gloating
the
moon
on
my
blossomy
bed
or
i
lay
where
a
fountain
of
blossoms
rained
rustling
from
arches
aloft
from
the
arbors
aloft
and
i
sang
as
the
blossoms
white
bosoms
pressed
to
mine
and
lay
soft
i
sang
as
their
redolence
stung
me
and
laughed
on
my
blossomy
couch
till
the
fragrance
and
music
had
flung
me
into
shadows
of
sleep
with
their
touch
the
magic
of
exquisite
touch
v
one
night
as
i
wondered
and
wandered
in
this
my
rare
aidenn
of
flowers
i
saw
where
i
lingered
and
pondered
a
youth
cast
asleep
mid
the
bowers
a
youth
on
a
mantle
of
satin
a
robe
in
the
flowers
vi
so
i
kissed
his
thin
eyelids
full
tender
i
kissed
his
high
forehead
and
pale
i
sighed
as
i
kissed
his
black
splendor
of
curls
that
were
kissed
of
the
gale
that
were
moved
of
the
gale
and
he
woke
and
cried
out
as
if
haunted
oh
god
for
one
note
of
that
song
for
a
sob
of
that
languishing
song
whose
tumult
of
sorrow
enchanted
and
swept
my
weak
spirit
along
vii
than
i
sate
me
upon
the
red
satin
and
plunged
a
long
look
in
his
eyes
i
bowed
on
the
weft
of
red
satin
and
kindled
his
love
with
my
sighs
with
fingers
of
lightness
set
sobbing
the
chords
of
my
harp
in
a
song
till
i
found
that
my
heart
was
and
sobbing
to
sing
like
a
tongue
was
sobbing
to
mix
with
the
song
viii
then
he
cried
and
his
dark
eyes
keen
glistened
lost
lost
for
that
perilous
music
oh
god
for
that
tyrannous
strain
to
which
in
my
dreams
i
have
listened
ah
wretch
i
have
listened
with
pain
and
he
tost
on
the
garment
of
satin
his
deep
raven
darkness
of
hair
and
the
song
at
my
lips
was
ungathered
and
i
sate
there
to
marvel
and
stare
ix
then
i
wrenched
from
my
soul
a
wild
glory
of
music
delirious
with
words
of
music
that
wailed
a
soul
story
and
trembled
with
words
or
fell
like
the
battling
of
swords
and
in
with
it
mixed
all
the
beauty
of
farewells
and
ravenous
sighs
the
heart
that
was
broken
for
booty
tears
rapture
to
know
that
one
dies
hell
heaven
and
laughter
and
cries
x
in
music
the
of
passion
the
terror
of
souls
that
are
lost
cold
dizzying
anguish
of
dying
all
torments
that
beauty
could
fashion
hot
manacles
of
love
and
their
cost
the
bliss
and
the
fury
of
dashing
a
soul
into
riotous
love
while
the
smiting
of
and
crashing
of
song
like
the
winds
were
enwove
with
the
stars
that
fall
sounding
above
xi
ah
why
did
the
slumber
seal
up
the
rare
light
of
his
eyes
with
its
silver
of
vapory
pinions
the
creature
that
sung
in
each
number
to
nest
in
his
eyes
like
a
bird
that
is
sick
of
the
skies
yet
he
murmured
so
sad
and
so
thrilling
oh
god
for
a
lifetime
of
song
oh
life
for
a
world
of
such
song
for
a
heaven
or
hell
and
the
killing
mad
angel
or
devil
of
song
oh
the
rapture
engendered
in
throwing
on
bubbles
of
music
and
song
a
soul
to
the
anguish
of
loving
until
like
a
flower
full
blowing
it
is
lost
in
a
whirlwind
most
strong
it
dies
in
a
thunder
of
song
xii
i
had
flung
in
my
song
the
emotion
triumphant
of
heart
and
of
soul
and
i
recked
not
the
passionate
ocean
that
rolled
to
abysses
of
dole
to
infinite
torture
and
dole
xiii
so
i
sang
and
i
harped
till
all
weary
i
sunk
on
the
red
of
that
robe
crouched
down
at
his
feet
on
the
satin
while
he
slumbered
with
eyelashes
teary
fringed
dark
each
dark
globe
then
i
wondered
and
said
it
is
dreary
to
see
him
so
still
on
this
robe
and
i
sobbed
and
i
sobbed
is
he
living
or
have
i
but
slain
with
my
song
and
it
seemed
that
a
demon
was
striving
to
strangle
my
heart
with
a
thong
with
terror
and
sorrow
of
wrong
xiv
and
i
rent
the
wild
harp
in
my
madness
from
his
ashen
brows
furrowed
the
hair
soft
wafted
dark
curls
from
pale
temples
they
rustled
with
death
and
the
sadness
of
his
face
so
hopelessly
fair
how
i
wailed
to
the
stars
of
the
heaven
how
they
scoffed
at
and
answered
my
grief
in
letters
of
flame
unforgiven
thou
deathless
whose
voice
is
a
thief
forever
and
ever
grief
xv
so
i
wept
on
the
instrument
broken
the
instrument
sweet
of
his
death
the
dagger
that
stabbed
not
to
kill
him
the
dagger
of
song
which
had
spoken
and
ravished
away
his
life
breath
so
i
wept
and
my
curls
thick
and
golden
stormed
entangled
and
showered
his
my
arms
around
him
were
enfolden
my
lips
clave
to
his
with
a
kiss
with
the
life
and
the
love
of
a
kiss
what
you
will
i
when
the
season
was
dry
and
the
sun
was
hot
and
the
hornet
sucked
gaunt
on
the
apricot
and
the
ripe
peach
dropped
to
its
seed
with
a
lean
red
wasp
that
stung
and
clung
when
the
hollyhocks
ranked
in
the
more
had
than
blossoms
i
wot
a
weariness
weighed
on
the
tongue
that
the
drought
of
the
season
begot
ii
when
the
black
grape
bulged
with
the
juice
that
burst
through
its
thick
blue
skin
that
was
cracked
with
thirst
and
the
round
gold
pippins
the
summer
had
nursed
in
the
yellowing
leaves
o
the
orchards
hung
when
the
reapers
their
lips
with
whistling
pursed
to
their
brows
in
the
corn
were
immersed
a
lightness
came
over
the
tongue
and
one
sung
as
much
as
one
durst
iii
when
the
skies
of
december
gray
dripped
and
dripped
and
icicles
eaves
of
the
big
barn
tipped
and
loud
hens
flew
over
the
snow
or
slipped
and
the
north
wind
hooted
and
bit
and
stung
and
the
ears
of
the
milkmaid
miriam
nipped
and
the
chappy
cheeks
of
the
farm
boy
whipped
a
goddess
unloosened
the
tongue
and
one
mouth
with
wild
honey
was
lipped
in
the
south
serenade
the
dim
verbena
drugs
the
dusk
with
heavy
lemon
odors
rare
wan
heliotropes
arabian
musk
exhale
into
the
dreamy
air
a
sad
wind
with
long
wooing
husk
swoons
in
the
roses
there
the
jasmine
at
thy
casement
flings
oozing
rich
perfumes
the
clematis
long
petaled
swings
deep
clusters
of
dark
purple
blooms
with
flowers
like
moons
or
sylphide
wings
magnolias
light
the
glooms
awake
awake
from
sleep
thy
balmy
hair
unbounden
deep
on
deep

blossoms
fair
who
sweetest
fragrance
weep
will
fill
the
night
with
prayer
awake
awake
from
sleep
and
dreaming
here
it
seems
to
me
some
dryad
bosoms
grow
confessed
nude
in
the
dark
magnolia
tree
that
rustles
with
the
murmurous
west
or
is
it
but
a
dream
of
thee
that
thy
white
beauty
guessed
in
southern
heavens
above
are
rolled
a
million
feverish
gems
which
burst
from
night
deep
ebon
caskets
old
with
inner
fires
that
seem
to
thirst
tall
oleanders
to
their
gold
drift
buds
where
dews
are
nursed
unseal
unseal
thine
eyes
where
long
her
rod
queen
mab
sways
their
skies
in
realms
of
nod
confessed
such
majesties
will
fill
the
night
with
god
unseal
unseal
thine
eyes
pan
haunter
of
green
intricacies
where
the
sunlight
amber
laces
deeps
of
darkest
violet
where
the
ugly
satyr
chases
shining
dryads
fair
as
graces
whose
lithe
limbs
with
dew
are
wet
piper
in
hid
mountain
places
where
the
oread
braces
winds
which
in
her
sweet
cheeks
set
of
aurora
rosy
traces
whiles
the
faun
from
myrtle
mazes
watcheth
with
an
eye
of
jet
what
art
thou
and
these
dim
races
thou
o
pan
of
many
faces
who
art
ruler
yet
tell
me
piper
have
i
ever
heard
thy
hollow
syrinx
quiver
trickling
music
in
the
trees
where
dark
hazel
copses
shiver
have
i
heard
its
dronings
sever
the
warm
silence
or
the
bees
ripple
murmurings
that
never
could
be
born
of
fall
or
river
whisperings
and
subtleties
melodies
so
very
clever
none
can
doubt
that
thou
the
giver
master
nature
keys
what
glad
awes
of
storm
are
given
thy
mad
power
which
has
striven
where
the
craggy
forests
glare
in
wild
mockery
when
heaven
splits
with
thunder
wedges
driven
red
through
night
and
rainy
air
what
art
thou
whose
presence
even
while
its
fear
the
heart
hath
riven
heals
it
with
a
prayer
pax
vobiscum
her
violets
in
thine
eyes
the
springtide
stained
i
know
two
bits
of
mystic
skies
on
which
the
green
turf
lies
whereon
the
violets
blow
i
know
the
summer
wrought
from
thy
sweet
heart
that
rose
with
that
faint
fragrance
fraught
its
sad
poetic
thought
of
peace
and
deep
repose
that
autumn
like
some
god
from
thy
delicious
hair
lost
sunlight
the
sod
shot
up
this
to
toss
it
everywhere
that
winter
from
thy
breast
the
snowdrop
whiteness
stole
much
kinder
than
the
rest
thy
innocence
confessed
the
pureness
of
thy
soul
mirabile
dictu
there
lives
a
goddess
in
the
west
an
island
in
seas
no
towered
towns
are
hers
confessed
no
castled
forts
and
palaces
hers
simple
worshipers
at
best
the
buds
the
birds
the
bees
and
she
hath
of
song
so
heavenly
beautiful
and
shed
so
sweetly
from
her
honeyed
tongue
the
savage
creatures
it
is
said
hark
their
wilds
among
and
nightingales
fall
dead
i
know
her
not
nor
have
i
known
i
only
feel
that
she
is
there
for
when
my
heart
is
most
alone
there
broods
communion
on
the
air
concedes
an
influence
not
its
own
miraculously
fair
then
fain
is
it
to
sing
and
sing
and
then
again
to
fly
and
fly
beyond
the
flight
of
cloud
or
wing
far
under
azure
arcs
of
sky
its
love
at
her
chaste
feet
to
fling
behold
her
face
and
die
questionings
now
when
wan
winter
sunsets
be
down
the
sky
when
nights
are
starless
utterly
and
sleeted
winds
cut
moaning
by
one
memory
keeps
one
company
and
conscience
puts
his
when
and
why
such
inquisition
when
alone
wakes
superstition
in
the
head
a
gorgon
face
of
hueless
stone
with
staring
eyes
to
terror
wed
stamped
on
her
brow
god
words
unknown
behind
the
dead
behind
the
dead
and
oh
that
weariness
of
soul
that
leans
upon
our
dead
the
clod
and
air
have
taken
as
a
whole
through
some
mysterious
period
life
with
thy
questions
of
control
death
with
thy
unguessed
laws
of
god
waiting
were
we
in
may
now
while
our
souls
are
yearning
sad
hearts
would
bound
and
smile
with
red
blood
burning
around
the
tedious
dial
no
slow
hands
turning
were
we
in
may
now
say
what
joy
to
know
her
heart
streams
pulse
away
in
winds
that
blow
see
graceful
limbs
of
may
revealed
to
glow
were
we
in
may
now
think
what
wealth
she
has
the
violets
pink
like
glass
about
the
wood
brook
brink
dark
sassafras
nights
which
the
large
stars
strew
on
rolled
nights
whose
feet
flash
with
dew
whose
long
locks
hold
aromas
cool
and
new
a
moon
curved
gold
this
makes
me
sad
in
march
i
long
and
long
to
see
the
torch
flame
far
and
strong
hear
on
my
porch
the
song
what
else
then
but
to
sleep
and
cease
from
such
dream
of
her
and
to
leap
at
her
white
touch
ah
me
then
wake
and
weep
weep
overmuch
this
is
why
day
by
day
time
lamely
crawls
feet
clogged
with
winter
clay
that
never
falls
while
the
dim
month
of
may
me
far
off
calls
in
late
fall
such
days
as
break
the
wild
bird
heart
such
days
as
kill
it
and
its
songs
a
death
which
knows
a
sweeter
part
of
days
to
which
such
death
belongs
and
now
old
eyes
are
filled
with
tears
as
with
the
rain
the
frozen
flowers
time
moves
so
slowly
one
but
fears
the
burthen
on
his
wasted
powers
and
so
he
stopped
and
thou
art
dead
and
that
is
found
which
once
was
feared
a
farewell
to
thy
gray
gray
head
a
goodnight
to
thy
goodly
beard
midwinter
the
from
the
rose
that
slips
hath
not
the
sparkle
of
her
lips
my
lady
lips
than
her
long
braids
of
yellow
hold
the
dandelion
hath
not
more
gold
her
braids
like
gold
the
hints
not
more
of
skies
than
do
the
flowers
in
her
eyes
my
lady
eyes
the
blossom
doth
not
wear
more
dainty
pinkness
than
her
ear
my
lady
ear
so
heigho
then
tho
skies
be
gray
my
heart
a
garden
that
is
gay
this
sorry
day
longing
when
rathe
many
peer
all
rain
filled
at
blue
april
skies
as
on
one
smiles
one
lady
dear
with
the
big
in
her
eyes
when
budded
i
wis
be
hidden
by
lone
greenwood
creeks
be
bashful
as
her
cheeks
we
kiss
be
waxen
as
her
dimpled
cheeks
then
do
i
pine
for
happier
skies
shy
fair
by
hill
and
burn
as
one
for
one
sweet
lady
eyes
and
her
white
cheeks
might
pine
and
yearn
in
middle
spring
when
the
fields
are
rolled
into
naked
gold
and
a
ripple
of
fire
and
pearl
is
blent
with
the
emerald
surges
of
wood
and
wold
like
a
bursting
violent
when
the
dingles
and
deeps
of
the
woodlands
old
are
glad
with
a
sibilant
life
new
sent
too
rare
to
be
told
are
the
manifold
sweet
fancies
that
quicken
redolent
in
the
heart
that
no
longer
is
cold
how
it
knows
of
the
wings
of
the
hawk
that
swings
from
the
drippled
dew
scintillant
seen
why
the
hides
where
it
sings
and
sings
in
melodious
quiverings
of
green
how
the
wind
to
the
and
dogwood
brings
big
pearls
of
worth
and
corals
of
sheen
whiles
he
lisps
to
the
strings
of
a
lute
that
rings
of
love
in
the
south
who
is
queen
where
the
fountain
of
poesy
springs
go
seek
in
the
ray
for
a
sworded
fay
the
chestnut
buds
into
blooms
that
rips
and
look
in
the
brook
that
runs
laughing
gay
for
the
nymph
with
the
laughing
lips
in
the
brake
for
the
dryad
whose
eyes
are
gray
from
whose
bosom
the
perfume
drips
the
faun
hid
away
where
the
grasses
sway
thick
ivy
low
down
on
his
hips
pursed
lips
on
a
syrinx
at
play
so
ho
for
the
rose
the
romeo
rose
and
the
lyric
he
hides
in
his
heart
and
ho
for
the
epic
the
oak
tree
knows
sonorous
and
mighty
in
art
the
lily
with
woes
that
her
white
face
shows
hath
a
satire
she
yearns
to
impart
but
none
of
those
her
hates
and
her
foes
for
a
heart
that
sings
but
for
sport
and
shifts
where
the
blows
tyranny
there
is
not
aught
more
merciless
than
such
fast
lips
that
will
not
speak
that
stir
not
if
i
curse
or
bless
a
god
that
made
them
weak
more
to
one
there
is
naught
than
such
white
eyelids
sealed
on
eyes
eyes
vacant
of
the
thing
named
thought
an
exile
in
the
skies
ah
silent
tongue
ah
ear
so
dull
how
angel
utterances
low
have
wooed
you
they
more
beautiful
than
mortal
harsh
with
woe
visions
when
the
snow
was
deep
on
the
and
the
sleet
was
caked
on
the
brier
when
the
frost
was
down
in
the
brown
bulbs
heads
and
the
ways
were
clogged
with
mire
when
the
wind
to
syringa
and
bare
brought
the
phantoms
of
vanished
flowers
and
the
days
were
sorry
as
sorry
could
be
and
time
limped
cursing
his
fardle
of
hours
heigho
had
i
not
a
book
and
the
logs
and
i
swear
that
i
was
mistaken
but
i
heard
the
frogs
croaking
in
bogs
and
the
song
in
the
braken
and
i
strolled
by
paths
which
the
springtide
knew
in
her
mossy
dells
by
her
ferny
passes
where
the
ground
was
holy
with
flowers
and
dew
and
the
insect
life
in
the
grasses
and
i
knew
the
spring
as
a
lover
who
knows
his
sweetheart
to
whom
he
has
given
a
kiss
on
the
cheek
that
warmed
its
white
rose
in
her
eyes
brought
the
laughter
of
heaven
for
a
poem
i
read
a
simple
thing
a
little
lyric
that
had
the
power
to
make
the
come
and
sing
and
the
winter
woodlands
flower
the
old
byway
its
rotting
fence
one
scarcely
sees
through
sumach
and
wild
blackberries
thick
elder
and
the
white
big
daisies
where
the
bees
hang
droning
in
repose
the
limber
lizards
glide
away
gray
on
its
moss
and
lichens
gray
warm
butterflies
float
in
the
sun
gay
ariels
of
the
lonesome
day
and
there
the
ground
squirrels
run
the
stays
one
note
to
lift
high
overhead
dark
swallows
drift
clouds
of
beaten
cream
through
which
hot
bits
of
azure
sift
the
gray
hawks
soar
and
scream
among
the
pungent
weeds
they
fill
dry
grasshoppers
pipe
with
a
will
and
in
the
ruts
where
stirs
the
basking
snake
shrill
head
the
locust
whirrs
at
evening
when
the
sad
west
turns
to
dusky
night
a
cheek
that
burns
the
in
the
sing

full

fire
their

ache
the

slow
half

weary
with

teary

through

the

unto

through

to
the
shade

that
is
her
heart
which
makes
them
sing
for
him
the
faultless
skies
of
noon
grow
farther
in
eternal
blue
as
heavens
that
buoy
the
balanced
moon
and
sow
the
stars
and
dew
who
would
believe
that
such
deep
skies
are
miracles
only
through

sylphs

quaff
deep

desires
from

tun
grapes
fatten
with
fires
from

as
a
novice
who
muses
lips

rosary
tell
while
her
thoughts
are
a
love
she
refuses
nay
mourns
as
not
well
the
ripe
apple
looses
its
holding
to
rot
where
it
fell
the
dryad
i
have
seen
her
limpid
eyes
large
with
gradual
laughter
rise
through
nettles
like
twin
blossoms
grow
and
stare
then
a
hating
envious
air
whisked
them
into
petals
i
have
seen
her
hardy
cheek
like
a
molten
coral
leak
through
the
leafage
shaded
of
thick
chickasaws
and
then
when
i
made
more
sure
again
to
a
red
plum
faded
i
have
found
her
racy
lips
and
her
graceful
but
a
haw
and
berry
glimmers
of
her
there
and
here
just
forsooth
enough
to
cheer
and
to
make
me
merry
often
on
the
ferny
rocks
dazzling
rimples
of
loose
locks
at
me
she
hath
shaken
and
i
followed
was
in
vain
they
had
trickled
into
rain
on
the
braken
once
her
full
limbs
flashed
on
me
naked
where
some
royal
tree
powdered
all
the
spaces
with
wan
sunlight
and
quaint
shade
such
a
haunt
romance
hath
made
for
haunched
there
i
wot
hid
amorous
pan
for
a
sudden
pleading
ran
through
the
maze
of
myrtle
whiles
a
rapid
violence
tossed
all
its
flowerage
was
the
lost
cooings
of
a
turtle
the
sweet
o
the
year
i
how
can
i
help
from
laughing
while
the
daffodilies
at
me
smile
the
tickled
dew
winks
tipsily
in
clusters
of
the
the
crocuses
and
hyacinths
storm
through
the
grassy
labyrinths
a
mirth
of
gold
and
violet
and
roses
bud
by
bud
flash
from
each
net
red
lips
of
maidenhood
ii
how
can
i
help
from
singing
when
the
swallow
and
the
hawk
again
are
noisy
in
the
hyaline
of
happy
heavens
clear
as
wine
the
robin
lustily
and
shrill
pipes
on
the
hill

the
fallow

what
though

be
tired
for
that
to
which
was
fired
the
far
dear
still
desired
beyond

scope
beyond

above
us
the
thing
we
would
have

us
that
will
know
nothing

only
bids
us
hope

it
still
behooves
us
ever
from
loving
to
sever
to
love
it
though
it
never
reciprocate
our
care
for
love
when
freely
given
lets
in
soft
hints
of
heaven
in

that
leaven
black
humors
of
despair
iii
for
in
this
life
diurnal
all
earthly
gross
infernal
conflicts
with
that
eternal
to
make
its
love
as
lust
to
rot
the
fairest
flower
of
thought
which
is
a
power
all
happiness
to
sour
and
burn
our
eyes
with
dust

believe
some
power
higher
breathes
in
us
this
desire
with
purpose
strange
as
fire
and
soft
though
seeming
hard
who
to
such
starved
endeavor

wasted
love
that
never

recompensed
forever

in
his
way
reward

sleep
whose

the

give
us
back
the
blisses
lost
madness
of
moist
kisses
the
youth
the
joy
the
tresses
the
fragrant
limbs
of

the

alive
with
subtle

lips
beautiful

incarnated

the

after
the
houri

dafter
made
flesh

a
slave
enough
of
tearful
sorrows
enough
of
rank
the
life
that
whines
and
borrows

memories
of

the
grave
that
breaks
no

fretting
no

long

forgetting
for

voiceless

to
follow
the

lorn
soaring
swallow
past
bourns
of
holt
and
hollow
forevermore
alone
a
blown
rose
lay
but
a
finger
on
that
pallid
petal
sweet
it
trembles
gray
and
wan
beneath
the
passing
feet
but
soft
blown
rose
we
know
a
merriment
of
bloom
a
life
of
sturdy
glow
but
no
such
dear
perfume
as
some
good
bard
whose
page
of
life
with
beauty
fraught
grays
on
to
ripe
old
age
through
with
thought
so
when
his
hoary
head
is
wept
into
the
tomb
the
mind
which
is
not
dead
sheds
round
it
rare
perfume
a
lorelei
full
fair
she
sits
throned
on
the
stream
that
dimly
rolls
still
with
her
wild
harp
knits
to
her
from
year
to
year
men
souls
they
hear
her
harp
they
hear
her
song
led
by
the
wizard
beauty
high
like
blind
brutes
maddened
rush
along
sink
at
her
cold
feet
gasp
and
die
mnemosyne
in
classic
beauty
cold
immaculate
a
voiceful
sculpture
stern
and
still
she
stands
upon
her
brow
deep
chiseled
love
and
hate
that
sorrow
dead
roses
in
her
hands
the
sirens
wail
wail
and
smite
your
lyres
sonorous
gold
and
beckon
naked
beauty
from
the
sea
in
arms
and
breasts
and
hips
of
godly
mold
dark
strangling
hair
carousing
to
the
knee
in
vain
in
vain
and
dull
in
unclosed
ears
to
one
loved
voice
sweet
calling
the
foam
which
in
my
heart
like
some
strong
hand
appears
to
gently
firmly
draw
my
vessel
home
the
vintager
among
the
fragrant
grapes
she
bows
long
violet
clusters
heap
her
hands
about
her
satyr
throats
and
brows
flush
at
her
smiled
commands
and
from
her
throat
at
times
as
bubbles
burst
on
wine
a
happy
fit
of
merry
rhymes
rings
down
the
hills
of
vine
from
out
one
heart
remorseless
sweet
she
plucked
the
passion
there
trod
in
the
of
her
feet
it
grew
into
despair
until
she
drained
its
honeyed
must
which
tingling
inward
part
by
part
fierce
mounted
thro
her
glowing
bust
and
centered
in
her
heart
a
stormy
sunset
soul
of
my
body
what
a
death
for
such
a
day
of
envious
gloom
unbroken
passion
of
the
sky
as
if
the
pure
breath
of
some
soft
power
ever
nigh
had
cleaving
in
the
bitter
sheath
burst
from
its
grave
a
gorgeous
bloom
the
majesty
of
clouds
that
swarm
expanding
in
a
furious
length
of
petals
flows
unutterable
and
where
the
warm
full
fire
is
centered
swims
and
glows
the
evening
star
with
strength
a
shimmering
of
the
storm
on
a
dial
and
is
but
the
world
wags
but
to
borrow
time
that
grows
gray
grammercy
time
but
sorrow
and
well
away
since
time
hales
but
to
sadness
and
to
decay
men
needs
wax
fools
for
madness
laugh
curse
and
pray
death
grapples
with
their
badness
the
devil
to
pay
unutterable
there
is
a
sorrow
in
the
wind
that
haunteth
me
she
like
a
penitent
heaps
on
rent
hairs
the
snow
thin
ashes
white
and
moans
and
moans
her
swaying
body
bent
and
superstition
gliding
softly
shakes
with
wasted
hands
that
vainly
grope
and
seek
the
rustling
curtains
of
each
cranny
makes
cold
ghostly
lips
that
wailing
fain
would
speak
midsummer
the
red
blood
clings
in
her
cheeks
and
stings
through
their
tan
with
a
fever
that
lightens
and
the
clearness
of
mountain
springs
in
her
dark
eyes
dusks
and
brightens
and
her
limbs
are
the
limbs
of
an
atalanta
who
swings
with
the
youths
in
the
sinewy
games
when
the
hot
air
sings
thro
the
hair
it
flings
and
the
circus
roars
hoarse
with
their
names
as
they
fly
to
the
goal
that
flames
a
voice
as
deep
as
wan
waters
that
sweep
thro
the
musical
reeds
of
a
river
a
song
of
red
reapers
that
bind
and
reap
with
the
ring
of
curved
scythes
that
quiver
the
lisp
of
the
pippins
that
leap
to
gold
to
the
ground
the
murmurous
sleep
that
the
cool
leaves
keep
on
close
lips
that
trickle
with
sound
and
sweet
is
the
beat
of
her
glowing
feet
and
her
smiles
as
wide
heavens
are
gracious
and
the
creating
might
of
her
hands
of
heat
as
a
god
or
a
goddess
spacious
the
elastic
veins
thro
her
heart
that
beat
are
rich
with
a
perishless
fire
and
her
bosoms
most
sweet
are
the
ardent
seat
of
a
mother
that
never
will
tire
wherever
she
fares
her
soft
voice
bears
high
powers
of
being
that
thicken
in
fruits
as
the
winds
made
thessalian
mares
of
old
mysteriously
quicken
the
apricots
juice
and
the
juice
of
the
pears
the
wine
great
hold
these
these
are
her
cares
and
her
wealth
she
declares
in
her
corn
vast
billows
of
gold
all
hail
to
her
lips
and
her
fruitful
hips
and
her
motherly
thickness
of
tresses
all
hail
to
the
sweetness
that
slips
and
drips
from
her
breasts
which
the
light
caresses
a
toiler
whose
fair
arm
heaps
and
whips
great
chariots
that
heavily
creak
a
worker
who
sweats
on
the
groaning
ships
and
never
grows
weary
or
weak

there
in

your

plenteous

everywhere
there
your
gladiolas
grew
parallels
of
scarlet
glare
and
the
primrose
cool
and
redolent
beautiful
balming
all
the
air
with
scent
roses
red
or

as
wool
roses
glorious
and
lush
rich
in

like
a
gay
tempestuous
rush
of
unnumbered
butterflies
lighting
on

bending

here
the
and
the
box
and
the
wayward
violets
clumps
of
phlox
and
the
myriad
flowery
jets
of
the
twilight
ah
the
beauty
of
the
place
when
the
june
made
one
great
rose
full
of
musk
and
mellow
grace
in
the
garden
humming
close
of
her
comely
mother
face
the
hollyhocks
budded
burst
and
flaunted
wide
gypsy
beauty
from
their
stocks
swung
in
flocks
tawny
flung
doublets
slashed
with
crimson
on
graceful
fair
and
young
like
circassians
in
the
sun
alabaster
lilies
swung
ah
the
droning
of
the
bee
in
his
dusty
pantaloons
tumbling
in
the
in
the
drowsy
afternoons
dreaming
in
the
pink
ah
the
moaning
dove
with
its
throat
of
amethyst
ruffled
like
a
shining
cove
which
a
wind
to
pearl
hath
kissed
moaning
moaning
of
its
love
and
the
insects
gossip
thin
from
the
summer
hotness
hid
in
the
leafy
shadows
green
then
at
eve
the
katydid
with
its
hard
unvaried
din
often
from
the
whispering
hills
lorn
within
the
golden
dusk
gold
with
gold
of
daffodils
thrilled
into
the
garden
musk
the
wild
wail
of
whippoorwills
from
the
purple
tangled
trees
like
the
white
full
heart
of
night
solemn
with
majestic
peace
swam
the
big
moon
veined
with
light
like
some
gorgeous
golden
fleece
you
were
there
with
me
and
you
in
the
magic
of
the
hour
almost
swore
that
you
could
view
beading
on
each
blade
and
flower
moony
blisters
of
the
dew
and
each
fairy
of
our
home
its
torch
then
lit
in
the
gloam
dashing
down
the
dusk
with
it
like
an
instant
flaming
foam
and
we
heard
the
calling
calling
of
the
wild
owl
in
the
brake
where
the
hung
crawling
down
the
ledge
into
the
lake
heard
the
sighing
streamlet
falling
then
we
wandered
to
the
creek
where
the
growing
like
fair
maidens
white
and
weak
naked
in
the
brooklet
flowing
stooped
to
bathe
a
bashful
cheek
and
the
moonbeams
rippling
golden
fell
in
aureoles
on
chaste
bosoms
half
beholden
till
meseemed
the
dainty
souls
of
pale
there
enfolden
in
such
beauty
dimly
fainted
within
each
bud
till
a
night
wind
swooning
over
field
and
flood
rocked
them
to
a
slumber
sainted
then
a
low
melodious
bell
of
some
sleeping
heifer
tinkled
in
some
dell
as
her
satin
dewlap
wrinkled
with
the
cud
that
made
it
swell
and
returning
home
we
heard
in
a
beech
tree
at
the
gate
some
brown
bird
singing
of
its
absent
mate
of
the
mate
that
never
heard
and
you
see
now
i
am
gray
why
within
the
old
old
place
with
such
memories
i
stay
fancy
out
your
absent
face
long
since
passed
away
you
were
mine
yes
still
are
mine
and
this
frosty
memory
reels
about
you
as
with
wine
warmed
into
wild
eyes
which
see
all
of
you
that
is
divine
yes
i
love
it
and
have
grown
melancholy
in
that
love
and
that
memory
alone
of
perfection
such
whereof
you
could
sanctify
a
stone
and
your
poppies
swing
there
we
walk
as
if
a
bee
fanned
them
with
his
puny
wing
down
your
garden
shadowy
in
the
hush
the
evenings
bring
five
fancies
i
the
gladiolas
as
tall
as
the
lily
as
tall
as
the
rose
and
almost
as
tall
as
the
hollyhocks
ranked
breast
to
breast
in
sentinel
rows
stand
the
gladiola
stocks
and
some
are
red
as
the
blood
and
some
are
pied
as
the
butterfly
race
and
each
is
shaped
like
a
velvet
hood
with
delicate
lace
for
you
know
the
goblins
that
come
like
musk
to
tumble
and
romp
in
the
flowers
laps
when
you
see
big
eyes
in
the
dusk
hang
there
their
goblin
caps
ii
the
they
bloom
up
the
fresh
green
trellis
in
airy
vigorous
ease
and
their
fragrant
sensuous
honey
is
best
beloved
of
the
bees
oh
the
rose
knows
the
dainty
secret
how
the
blows
for
the
rose
told
me
the
secret
and
the
jessamine
told
the
rose
and
the
jessamine
said
at
midnight
ere
the
red
cock
woke
and
crew
that
the
fays
of
queen
titania
came
there
to
bathe
in
the
dew
and
the
merry
moonlight
glistened
on
wet
long
yellow
hair
and
their
feet
on
the
flowers
drowsy
trod
softer
than
any
air
and
their
petticoats
gay
as
bubbles
they
hung
up
every
one
on
the
tendrils
till
their
moonlight
bath
were
done
but
the
red
cock
crew
too
early
and
the
fays
left
hurriedly
and
this
is
why
in
the
morning
their
petticoats
there
you
see
iii
the
a
sultan
proud
and
tawny
at
elegant
ease
he
stands
with
his
bare
throat
brown
and
scrawny
and
his
indolent
hands
and
the
eunuch
tulips
that
listen
in
their
gaudy
turbans
so
with
their
scimetar
leaves
that
glisten
are
guards
of
his
seraglio
where
sultana
roses
musky
voluptuous
in
houri
charms
with
their
bold
breasts
deep
and
dusky
impatiently
wait
his
arms
tall
beautiful
sad
and
slender
his
dancing
slaves
for
the
lilies
tender
his
royal
hand
he
waves
while
he
watches
them
softly
smiling
his
favorite
rose
that
hour
with
a
butterfly
gallant
is
wiling
in
her
bower
iv
vengeance
i
let
it
sink
let
it
sink
on
the
pink
by
those
poppy
puffs
downiness
light
weak
moth
in
furry
dress
of
white
fluffy
stuffs
ii
where
the
thin
light
slipping
sweet
dimples
prints
of
fairy
feet
on
the
blooms
one
dim
blossom
delicate
droops
a
face
all
pale
with
hate
dead
with
sick
perfumes
iii
and
i
read
the
riddle
wove
in
this
rose
course
of
love
for
the
fickle
pink
thou
the
rose
phantom
art
stealing
to
the
pink
false
heart
to
drink
v
a
dead
lily
i
the
south
had
saluted
her
mouth
till
her
mouth
was
sweet
with
the
south
ii
and
the
north
with
his
breathings
low
made
the
blood
in
her
veins
like
his
snow
iii
and
the
west
with
his
smiles
and
his
art
poured
his
honey
of
life
in
her
heart
iv
and
the
east
had
in
whisperings
told
his
secrets
more
precious
than
gold
v
so
she
grew
to
a
beautiful
thought
which
a
godhead
of
love
had
wrought
vi
as
strange
how
the
power
begot
it
as
why
but
to
kill
it
and
rot
it
my
suit
faith
the
dandelion
is
to
my
mind
too
lowly
then
the
winsome
violet
is
forsooth
too
holy
there
the
go
to
what
a
face
that
speckled
like
a
buxom
which
the
sun
hath
freckled
and
the
wild
flirts

fierce

haughty

the
rose

swear
pricks
you

is
naughty
columbine
a
fool

then
she
is
too
merry

i
would

shows
sorrow
pale

old
chronicled

the

the

at

said
through
ghostly

throbs
while
to
thin
starlight
overhead
the
shivering

rose
as
white
as

in
splendor
to

million
million
starlets

rocking

barlets
she
with

rose
and
oared
a
shining
shoulder
to
a
boulder
with
slim
fingers
soft
and
milky
haled
her
from
the
lilies
to
a
ledge
and
sitting
silky
sang
unto
the
lilies
sang
and
sang
beneath
the
heaven
belted
wreathed
with
lilies
seven
falsely
sang
a
wild
wild
ditty
to
a
moon
till
a
child
both
frail
and
pretty
found
her
singing
on
the
boulder
dark
locks
on
a
milky
shoulder
the
moon
and
the
creature
singing
there
strangled
him
in

down
he
hears
the
mermaid
sing

sad
far
off
like

is
glad

sad

leagues

leagues
ribbed
of
the

the
near

bends
from
on

the
pale
brow
of
a
slave
and
when
the
morning
beams
lie
crushed
on
crag
and
bay
a
wail
of
flutes
and
lutes
the
lone
land
swoons
away
the
woods
are
from
rest
a
scent
of
earth
and
brine
by
brake
and
lake
the
wild
things
wake
and
torrents
leap
and
shine
but
she
in
one
gray
tower
knows
how
he
died
and
a
murderous
scorn
on
her
lips
is
born
to
curse
his
heart
that
lied
she
smiles
and
sorrows
not
ah
death
to
know
she
moans
the
gluttonous
grave
of
the
bitter
wave
laughs
loud
above
his
bones
she
laughs
and
hating
yearns
out
toward
the
surf
far
reach
like
one
in
sleep
who
wild
to
weep
hath
only
moans
for
speech
and
when
the
sun
had
set
and
crocus
heavens
had
fed
their
wan
fire
soon
to
a
moon
the
flocking
stars
that
led
a
breeze
set
in
from
sea
most
odorous
with
spice
and
streamed
among
big
stars
that
hung
thin
mists
as
white
as
ice
and
then
her
eyes
waxed
large
with
one
last
hideous
hope
and
her
throat
she
bent
toward
the
firmament
scope
on
scope
the
haunted
night
that
felt
the
rapture
so
accursed
shook
loosening
one
green
star
that
spun
wild
down
the
dusk
and
burst
fair
was
her
face
as
sin
ah
wretch
she
wailed
to
know
a
wormy
seat
at
death
lean
feet
may
not
undo
such
woe
the
pit
much
dearer
than
god
deeps
of
serious
skies
where
thought
dies
and
memory
never
sleeps
and
dearer
far
than
both
than
heaven
or
hell
the
jest
the
godless
lot
to
rot
and
rot
and
not
be
cursed
or
blessed
the
spring
fons
bandusiæ
push
back
the
brambles
the
hollowed
spring
is
full
in
view
deep
tangled
with
luxuriant
fern
its
crystal
urn
not
for
the
loneliness
that
keeps
the
coigne
wherein
its
silence
sleeps
not
for
wild
butterflies
that
sway
their
pansy
pinions
all
the
day
above
its
mirror
nor
the
bee
nor
which
passing
see
themselves
reflected
in
its
spar
not
for
the
one
white
liquid
star
that
twinkles
in
its
firmament
nor
clouds
so
slowly
sent
athwart
it
when
the
kindly
night
beads
all
its
grasses
with
the
light
small
jewels
of
the
dimpled
dew
not
for
the
day
reflected
blue
nor
the
quaint
dainty
colored
stones
that
dance
within
it
where
it
moans
not
for
all
these
i
love
to
sit
in
silence
and
to
gaze
in
it
but
know
a
nymph
with
merry
eyes
meets
mine
within
its
laughing
skies
a
graceful
naked
nymph
who
plays
all
the
long
fragrant
summer
days
with
instant
sight
of
bees
and
birds
and
speaks
with
them
in
one
for
whose
nakedness
the
air
weaves
moony
mists
and
on
whose
hair
unfilleted
the
night
will
set
that
lone
star
as
a
coronet
lillita
can
i
forget
how
when
you
stood
orchards
whence
spring
bloom
had
fled
stars
made
the
orchards
seem
and
weighed
the
sighing
boughs
with
shining
ghosts
of
blossoms
dead
or
when
you
bowed
a
lily
tall
above
your
august
lilies
slim
transparent
pale
that
by
the
wall
like
softest
moonlight
seemed
to
swim
brimmed
with
faint
fragrance
to
the
brim
and
in
the
cloud
that
lingered
low
a
silent
pallor
in
the
west
there
stirred
and
beat
a
golden
glow
of
some
great
heart
that
could
not
rest
a
heart
of
gold
within
its
breast
your
heart
your
life
was
in
the
wild
your
joy
to
hear
the
lament
its
love
when
wafted
mild
the
harvest
drifted
from
the
hill
the
deep
deep
wildwood
where
had
trod
the
red
deer
the
fallen
hush
of
fall
torn
leaves
when
the
low
tod
was
frosty
each
berried
bush
at
dusk
the
still
complains
above
your
lolling
lilies
where
their
faces
white
the
moonlight
stains
the
dreamy
stream
flows
far
and
fair
of
rest
an
easeful
air
o
music
of
the
falling
rain
at
night
unto
her
painless
rest
sound
sweet
and
sad
then
is
she
fain
to
see
the
wild
flowers
on
her
breast
lift
moist
pure
faces
up
again
to
breathe
to
god
their
fragrance
blest
beeches
long
have
crossed
old
mighty
arms
above
her
tomb
where
oft
i
watch
at
night
her
ghost
bow
to
the
bloom
a
mist
of
curls
where
summer
lost
her
tangled
sunbeams
and
perfume
artemis
oft
of
the
hiding
oread
wast
thou
seen
at
earliest
morn
a
tall
imperial
shape
and
on
close
chaste
curls
long
blackness
of
thick
hair
the
tipsy
drops
caught
from
the
dipping
sprays
of
under
bosks
kissed
of
thy
cheek
and
of
thy
shoulder
brushed
thy
rosy
cheek
as
haughty
hera
fair
thy
shoulder
luminous
as
light
oft
did
the
shaggy
hills
and
solitudes
of
arethusa
shout
and
ring
and
reel
reverberate
and
echo
merrily
with
the
mad
chiding
of
thy
merry
hounds
big
mouthed
and
musical
that
on
the
stag
or
bristling
furious
grew
in
quest
and
thou
as
keen
and
thou
thou
o
goddess
with
thy
quivered
crew
most
loveliest
maids
and
fit
to
wed
with
gods
rushed
swinging
on
the
wind
free
limbs
and
lithe
long
as
thy
radiant
locks
flung
free
to
blow
and
lighten
in
the
air
of
morn
ai
me
their
throats
their
lusty
dimpled
throats
that
made
the
hills
sing
and
the
dance
as
if
to
orphic
strains
and
gave
them
life
ai
me
their
bosoms
deepness
and
the
soft
sweet
happy
beauty
of
their
delicate
limbs
that
stormed
the
forest
vacancies
with
light
swift
daylight
of
their
splendor
and
made
blow
within
the
glad
sonorous
solitudes
old
germs
of
flowerets
a
century
cold
the
woodland
naiad
whispered
by
her
rock
the
hamadryad
and
wild
expectant
rustled
by
her
usual
oak
and
laughed
in
wonder
and
mad
pan
himself
reeled
piping
fiercely
down
the
dingled
deeps
with
rollicking
eye
that
rolled
a
brutish
lust
and
did
the
unwed
maiden
musing
where
her
father
well
beyond
the
hills
bubbled
and
babbled
hear
the
full
high
cry
of
the
chaste
huntress
while
her
dripping
jar
unheeded
brimmed
vowed
with
her
chastity
and
shorn
gold
hair
to
veil
her
virgin
feet
but
ah
not
when
the
saucy
daylight
swims
filling
the
forests
with
a
glamorous
green
let
me
behold
thee
goddess
but
when
dim
the
slow
night
settles
on
the
haunted
wild
and
walks
in
sober
sark
and
heatful
stars
shine
out
intensely
and
the
echoy
waste
far
off
far
off
in
shudders
palpitates
unto
the
limnad
song
unmerciful
unmerciful
and
mad
and
bitter
sweet
then
come
in
all
thy
godhead
beautiful
thou
beautiful
and
gentle
as
thou
to
lorn
endymion
who
in
lemnos
once
lone
in
the
wizard
magic
of
the
wild
wandered
a
gentle
boy
unfriended
sad
it
grew
far
off
adown
the
stirring
trees
thy
silent
beauty
blossoming
flowerlike
between
the
tree
trunks
and
the
lacing
limbs
bright
in
the
leaves
that
kissed
for
very
joy
and
drunkenness
of
glory
thus
revealed
he
saw
it
all
the
naked
brow
and
limbs
the
polished
silver
of
thy
glossy
breast
alone
uncompanied
of
handmaidens
like
some
full
splendid
fruit
hesperian
not
for
deities
thy
sweet
far
voice
came
tinkling
on
his
wistful
ear
and
lisped
like
leaves
that
cling
and
slip
to
cling
again
and
on
such
perilous
beauty
that
must
kill
the
poisonous
favor
of
thy
godliness
feasting
his
every
sense
through
eyes
and
ears
his
soul
exalted
waxed
and
amorous
like
the
high
gods
who
quaff
deep
golden
bowls
of
rosy
nectar
with
immortal
love
and
what
remained
ah
what
remained
but
death
in
november
no
windy
white
of
clouds
is
thine
no
windy
white
but
low
and
sodden
gray
that
holds
the
melancholy
skies
and
kills
the
wild
song
and
the
wild
bird
yet
ai
me
thy
melancholy
skies
and
mournful
woods
brown
sighing
forests
dying
that
i
love
thy
long
thick
leaves
deep
deep
about
my
feet
slow
weary
feet
that
halt
or
falter
on
thy
long
sweet
reddened
leaves
that
burn
and
die
with
silent
fever
of
the
sickened
wold
i
love
to
hear
in
all
thy
windy
coigns
and
choked
with
bleached
and
rotting
weeds
the
of
the
many
leaves
that
fallen
on
barren
ways
like
fallen
hopes
once
held
so
high
on
all
the
summer
heart
of
strong
majestic
trees
now
come
to
such
would
fainly
gossip
in
hushed
undertones
sad
weak
yet
sweet
as
natures
that
have
known
true
tears
and
hot
in
bleak
remorseless
days
of
all
their
whilom
glory
vanished
so
a
character
he
lived
beyond
us
and
we
stood
as
pygmies
to
his
every
mood
mere
pupils
at
his
beck
and
nod
that
spoke
the
influence
of
a
god
and
oft
we
wondered
when
his
thought
made
our
humanity
seem
naught
if
he
like
uther
mystic
son
were
not
a
birth
for
avalon
when
the
sighing
trees
his
soul
waxed
genial
with
the
breeze
that
voiceful
from
the
piney
glades
companioned
seemed
of
oreads
a
dryad
life
lived
in
each
oak
and
with
its
many
spoke
glorying
the
deity
whose
power
gave
it
its
life
in
sun
and
shower
by
every
brook
where
every
nook
rippled
and
laughed
with
he
walked
as
one
on
sainted
grounds
fearing
intrusion
on
the
spell
that
kept
some
well
or
woodland
genius
sitting
where
brown
racy
berries
kissed
his
hair
and
when
the
wind
far
the
hill
had
and
left
the
wildwood
still
as
moonlight
jets
on
quiet
moss
beneath
the
pied
boughs
arched
across
long
limpid
vistas
brimmed
with
ripe
sunbeams
heard
the
pipe
of
some
hid
follower
of
pan
and
worshiper
half
brute
half
man
who
a
savage
rhyme
puffed
in
his
reed
to
rudest
time
with
swollen
jowl
and
rolling
eye
danced
boisterous
where
the
silver
sky
smiled
in
the
forest
broken
roof
the
strident
branch
beneath
his
hoof
snapped
on
the
sod
which
interfused
between
black
roots
was
crushed
and
bruised
and
often
when
he
wandered
through
old
forests
at
the
fall
of
dew
a
lone
endymion
who
sought
a
higher
beauty
yet
uncaught
some
night
we
thought
most
surely
he
were
favored
of
her
deity
and
in
the
holy
solitude
her
sudden
presence
long
pursued
unto
his
eyes
would
be
confessed
the
awful
moonlight
of
her
breast
come
high
with
majesty
and
hold
his
heart
blood
till
his
heart
were
cold
unpulsed
unsinewed
all
undone
and
snatch
his
soul
to
avalon
a
mood
bowed
hearts
that
hold
the
saddest
memories
are
the
most
beautiful
and
such
make
sweet
light
happy
moods
of
alien
natures
which
their
sadness
contacts
and
so
sanctifies
and
such
to
me
is
an
old
gabled
house
deserted
and
neglected
and
unknown
within
the
dreamy
hollow
of
its
hills
dark
cedared
hills
and
fruitless
orchards
sear
with
but
its
host
of
shrouded
memories
haunting
its
low
and
desolate
rooms
and
halls
its
roomy
hearths
and
crevices
here
in
dim
rainy
noons
i
love
to
sit
and
hear
the
running
rain
along
the
roof
the
creak
and
crack
of
noises
that
are
born
of
unseen
and
mysterious
agencies
the
dripping
footfalls
of
the
wind
adown
lone
winding
stairways
a
clapping
door
and
then
a
sudden
hush
that
brings
a
pleasant
terror
stiffening
through
the
tingling
veins
and
staring
from
the
eyes
then
comes
the
running
rain
along
the
gables
and
on
walls
invokes
vague
images
and
memories
of
all
its
sometime
lords
and
mistresses
until
the
stale
material
will
assume
all
that
clairvoyant
and
the
ear
in
quaint
far
rooms
or
dusty
corridors
hear
wrinkled
ladies
all
beruffled
trail
long
haughty
silks
miraculously
stiff
a
thought
and
i
have
thought
of
youth
which
strains
nearer
its
god
to
rise
what
were
ambition
and
its
pains
were
life
a
cowardice
the
grander
souls
that
rose
above
thought
noblest
heights
to
tread
found
their
endeavor
in
their
love
and
truth
behind
the
dead
a
secret
glory
in
the
tomb
a
night
that
dawns
in
light
an
intense
presence
veiled
with
gloom
and
not
an
endless
night
nepenthe
of
this
struggling
world
thou
who
dost
stay
mad
care
when
her
fury
scourge
above
is
curled
and
we
see
her
writhing
hair
song
i
far
over
the
summer
sea
ere
the
stars
wax
pale
from
the
groves
where
a
nightingale
wails
a
mystical
melody
i
turn
my
ghostly
sail
away
away
to
follow
a
face
i
see
far
over
the
summer
sea
ii
far
over
the
summer
sea
ere
the
cliff
which
highest
soars
from
the
foam
shores
reddens
all
rosily
where
the
water
roars
far
on
far
on
thro
the
night
i
follow
thee
far
over
the
summer
sea
iii
far
over
the
summer
sea
when
the
great
gold
moon
low
lies
in
the
skies
i
drift
on
tearfully
till
a
spirit
form
doth
rise
low
down
low
down
the
orbèd
moon
and
me
far
over
the
summer
sea
iv
far
over
the
summer
sea
with
thy
limbs
wound
sweet
hair
and
throat
and
feet
to
slay
me
utterly
at
each
mad
hot
heart
beat
a
kiss
a
kiss
to
drain
the
soul
with
thee
deep
deep
in
the
summer
sea
face
to
face
dead
and
all
the
haughty
fate
fair
on
throat
and
face
of
wax
white
calm
hands
crossed
still
and
lax
cold
impassionate
dead
and
no
word
whispered
low
at
the
dull
ear
now
could
wake
one
responsive
chord
or
make
one
wan
temple
glow
dead
and
no
hot
tear
would
stir
all
that
woman
sweet
and
fair
woman
soul
from
feet
to
hair
which
was
once
of
her
god
and
thus
to
die
and
i
i
must
live
though
life
be
but
one
long
hard
monotonous
rut
there
to
plod
and
die
creeds
are
well
in
such
a
case
but
no
sermon
could
have
wrought
more
of
faith
than
you
have
taught
with
your
pale
dead
face
and
i
see
it
as
you
see
one
mistake
so
very
small
yet
so
great
it
mangled
all
left
you
this
and
me
oft
i
pondered
saying
sure
she
could
never
live
such
life
and
the
truth
stabbed
like
a
knife
when
i
found
you
pure
pure
so
pure
and
me
bemoiled
loathly
as
loathed
vermin
just
as
weak
souls
are
left
of
lust
loveless
low
and
soiled
nay
i
loved
you
then
and
love
grand
great
eyes
i
see
them
yet
set
like
luminous
gems
of
jet
in
wax
lids
above
lips
o
poor
dumb
chideless
lips
once
as
red
as
life
could
make
moist
as
wan
wild
roses
wake
when
the
wild
dew
drips
hair
imperial
full
and
warm
as
a
grace
where
one
stone
precious
lay
ensnared
and
shone
like
a
star
in
storm
eyes
at
parting
big
with
pain
god
i
see
them
and
the
tear
in
them
big
as
eyes
of
deer
led
by
lights
and
slain
life
so
true
i
falsely
cursed
lips
that
curled
with
scorn
and
pride
hurt
me
though
i
said
while
the
true
heart
burst
rest
my
heart
has
suffered
too
and
this
life
had
woe
enough
for
the
little
dole
of
love
given
to
me
and
you
can
you
hear
me
can
you
know
what
i
am
and
how
it
came
you
beyond
me
like
a
flame
you
before
me
like
the
snow
dead
and
all
my
heart
a
cup
hollowed
for
sad
bitter
tears
bitter
in
the
bitter
years
slowly
brimming
up
sleep
is
well
but
might
have
been
better
yes
god
knows
it
might
better
for
me
in
his
sight
and
my
soul
more
clean
sleep
in
very
peace
but
i
with
earth
other
fools
will
stay
live
laughter
day
by
day
mocking
laugh
and
die
you
will
know
me
now
i
know
but
in
life
had
known
how
indeed
i
was
alone
but
is
better
so
and
i
know
you
what
you
were
faithful
and
it
were
no
use
only
to
yourself
abuse
i
shall
tell
you
there
there
beyond
the
lightning
and
the
long
clouds
and
utter
skies
moons
and
suns
and
stars
that
rise
where
we
understand
the
changeling
i
there
were
faëries
two
or
three
and
a
high
moon
white
as
wool
or
a
bloom
in
faëry
where
the
blossoms
be
beautiful
ii
there
were
faëries
two
or
three
and
a
wind
as
fragrant
as
spicy
wafts
from
arcady
rocked
the
sleeping
honey
bee
in
the
clover
grass
iii
there
were
faëries
two
or
three
wee
white
caps
and
red
wee
shoon
buckles
at
each
dainty
knee
we
are
come
to
comfort
thee
with
the
silver
moon
iv
there
were
faëries
two
or
three
buttercups
brimmed
up
with
dew
winning
faces
sweet
to
see
then
mine
eyes
closed
heavily
faëries
what
would
you
v
there
were
faëries
two
or
three
and
my
babe
was
dreaming
deep
white
as
whitest
ivory
in
its
crib
of
ebony
rocked
and
crooned
on
sleep
vi
there
were
faëries
two
or
three
standing
in
the
mocking
moon
and
mine
eyes
closed
drowsily
drowsily
and
suddenly
there
my
babe
was
gone
vii
now
no
faëries
two
or
three
loitered
in
the
moon
alone
jesu

comfort
me
what
is
this
instead
i
see
ugly
skin
and
bone
viii
there
were
faëries
two
or
three
stood
with
buckles
on
red
shoon
but
with
evil
sorcery
my
sweet
babe
to
faëry
they
did
steal
right
soon
john
eve
i
dizzily
round
on
the
white
in
the
yellow
moonlight
to
a
sweet
unholy
ravishing
sound
of
wizard
voices
from
underground
their
mazy
dance
the
wound
on
john
eve
ii
beautiful
white
like
a
wreath
of
mist
by
the
starbeams
kissed
and
frail
sweet
faces
bloomed
out
on
the
night
from
floating
tresses
of
light
that
puffed
like
foam
to
the
left
and
the
right
on
john
eve
iii
warily
there
they
flashed
like
a
rill
which
the
moonbeams
fill
but
i
saw
what
a
mockery
all
of
them
were
with
their
hollow
bodies
when
the
moonlit
air
rayed
out
through
their
eyes
with
a
sudden
glare
on
john
eve
iv
solemnly
sweet
by
the
river
banks
in
the
rushes
ranks
the
necks
their
sorrowful
songs
repeat
a
music
of
winds
over
dipping
wheat
of
cascades
seemed
to
meet
on
john
eve
v
drowsily
swam
the
fleet
in
eddies
of
heat
through
the
willows
a
glimmer
of
gold
harps
came
and
i
saw
their
hair
like
a
misty
flame
bunched
over
white
brows
too
white
to
name
on
john
eve
vi
beggarly
torn
a
wizen
chap
in
a
cap
all
gray
with
the
chaff
and
dust
of
the
corn
and
strong
with
the
pungent
scent
of
the
barn
the
nis
scowled
under
the
flowering
thorn
on
john
eve
vii
merrily
call
the
singing
crickets
in
the
twinkling
thickets
and
the
troll
hill
rose
on
pillars
tall
crimson
pillars
that
ranked
a
hall
where
the
trolls
were
holding
a
ball
on
john
eve
viii
reveling
flew
from
beakers
of
gold
the
wassail
old
and
she
reached
me
a
goblet
brimmed
bright
with
dew
but
her
wily
witcheries
well
i
knew
and
the
philtre
over
my
shoulder
threw
on
john
eve
lalage
what
were
sweet
life
without
her
who
maketh
all
things
sweet
with
smiles
that
dream
about
her
with
dreams
that
come
and
fleet
soft
moods
that
end
in
languor
soft
words
that
end
in
sighs
curved
frownings
as
of
anger
cold
silence
of
her
eyes
sweet
eyes
born
but
for
slaying
deep
and
lost
in
dreams
of
whilom
maying
in
climes
unstung
of
frost
wild
eyes
shot
through
with
fire
god
light
in
godless
years
brimmed
with
desire
a
birth
for
dreams
and
tears
dear
tears
as
sweet
as
laughter
low
laughter
sweet
as
love
unwound
in
ripples
after
sad
tears
we
knew
not
of
what
if
the
day
be
lawless
what
if
the
heart
be
dead
such
tears
would
make
it
flawless
such
laughter
make
it
red
lips
that
were
curled
for
kisses
for
loves
and
hates
and
scorns
brows
under
gold
of
tresses
brows
beauteous
as
the
morn
imperial
locks
and
tangled
down
to
the
graceful
hips
hair
where
one
might
be
strangled
carousing
on
thy
lips
lips
that
hover
about
the
honeyed
words
that
slip
wild
bees
from
clover
whose
sweets
their
sweet
affords
though
days
be
robbed
of
sunlight
white
teeth
make
light
thereof
though
nights
unknown
of
onelight
thine
eyes
were
stars
enough
ah
features
round
temples
throat
and
chin
sweet
gods
of
godless
natures
sweet
love
of
loveless
men
still
moods
and
slumberous
fanned
on
to
dreams
that
rock
to
sleep
unmerciful
abandon
that
haunts
or
makes
one
weep
she
walks
as
if
with
sorrows
and
all
unknown
of
joy
eyes
fixed
on
dim
that
all
sad
feet
decoy
yet
she
a
peer
of
pleasures
tears
from
time
taloned
hand
the
he

and
wastes
its
sullen
sand
makes
of
all
hours
a
beaker
brimmed
full
of
lordly
wine
cold
gold
of
life
mad
liquor
and
quaffs
to
me
and
mine
the
love
on
lips
grows
fairer
keen
lights
in
eyes
make
wars
and
throat
and
breast
grow
rarer
than

fleet
and

snared
it
as

whole
what

the
fear
of
heaven

hell
lost
in
the
life
thus
given

might
bid
farewell

against

farewell
the
hoarse
strident
laughter
of

miriam
white
clouds
and
buds
and
birds
and
bees
low
piped
from
southern
seas
brought
thee
a
offering
a
baby
with
the
spring
she
as
her
april
gave
to
thee
a
soul
of
winsome
vagary
large
heavenly
eyes
and
tender
whence
shone
the
sweet
mind
soft
influence
where
all
the
winning
woman
that
welled
up
in
tears
high
sparkling
sat
she
with
the
dower
of
her
may
gave
thee
a
nature
that
could
sway
wild
men
with
kindness
and
a
pride
which
all
their
littleness
denied
limbs
wrought
of
lilies
and
a
face
bright
as
a
rose
flower
and
a
grace
that
clings
like
happiness
in
each
chaste
billow
of
thy
dress
she
as
her
heavy
june
brought
down
night
deeps
of
hair
thy
brow
to
crown
a
voice
so
mild
and
musical
it
is
as
that
fall
bars
of
pearl
and
in
thy
heart
stamped
like
a
jewel
that
should
start
from
thy
pure
face
in
smiles
and
break
like
radiance
when
it
laughed
or
spake
affection
that
is
born
of
truth
and
goodness
which
make
very
youth
the
wind
the
ways
of
the
wind
are
eerie
and
i
love
them
all
the
blithe
the
mad
and
the
dreary
spring
winter
and
fall
when
it
tells
to
the
waiting
crocus
its
beak
to
show
and
hangs
on
the
wayside
locust
of
snow
when
it
comes
like
a
balmy
blessing
from
the
musky
wood
the
roses
caressing
till
their
cheeks
show
blood
when
it
roars
in
the
autumn
season
and
whines
with
rain
or
sleet
like
a
mind
without
reason
or
a
soul
in
pain
when
the
once
so
spicy
with
bud
and
bloom
are
desolate
sear
and
icy
as
the
icy
tomb
when
the
wild
owl
crouched
and
frowsy
in
the
rotten
tree
wails
dolorous
cold
and
drowsy
his
shuddering
melody
then
i
love
to
sit
in
december
where
the
big
hearth
sings
and
dreaming
forget
and
remember
a
host
of
things
and
the
wind
i
hear
how
it
strangles
and
gasps
and
sighs
on
the
roof
sharp
shivering
angles
that
front
the
skies
how
it
groans
and
romps
and
tumbles
in
attics
in
the
chimney
rumbles
then
all
at
once
falls
dead
till
it
comes
like
footsteps
slipping
of
a
child
on
the
stair
or
a
quaint
old
gentleman
tripping
with
heavily
powdered
hair
and
my
soul
grows
anxious
hearted
for
those
once
dear
the
loves
departed
in
the
wind
draw
near
and
i
seem
to
see
their
faces
not
one
estranged
in
their
old
accustomed
places
the
wide
hearth
ranged
and
the
wind
that
waits
and
poises
where
the
shadows
sway
makes
their
visionary
voices
seem
calling
me
far
away
and
i
wake
in
tears
to
listen
again
to
the
sobbing
wind
far
out
on
the
lands
that
glisten
like
the
voice
of
one
who
sinned
music
a
nocturne
the
soul
of
love
is
harmony
as
such
all
melodies
that
with
wide
pinions
beat
elastic
bars
which
mew
it
in
the
flesh
till
away
to
kiss
their
throats
and
cling
are
kindred
to
the
soul
and
while
they
sway
lords
of
its
action
molding
all
at
will
ah
neither
was
i
i
nor
knew
the
clay
for
all
my
soul
lay
on
full
waves
of
song
reverberating
the
earth
and
moon
o
soft
complaints
that
haunted
all
the
heart
with
dreams
of
love
long
cherished
love
dreams
found
on
sunset
mountains
gorgeous
toward
the
west
kisses
soft
kisses
bartered
pale
buds
of
bursting
springs
and
vows
of
fondest
faith
kept
evermore
and
eyes
whose
witchery
might
lure
old
saints
down
to
the
lowest
hell
for
one
swift
glance
sweet
melancholy
eyes
yet
full
of
hope
and
dimming
with
tears
stooping
and
gloating
in
a
silver
mist
at
care
thin
brow
and
growing
at
his
eyes
voices
of
expectation
rolling
on
to
diapason
of
a
mighty
choir
throbbings
beating
low
wove
in
hoarse
fabric
thunders
and
o
soul
wafted
to
caverns
lost
by
hideous
seas
one
with
the
tumult
tiers
white
with
strange
diamond
spars
and
feathery
gems
o
holy
music
wailing
down
long
aisles
to
lose
thyself
arched
welkins
dashed
with
moons
of
crystal
dying
dying
down
to
passionate
sobs
and
then
a
silence
vast
vast
as
thy
caves
or
as
the
human
soul
oppressing
all
this
being
bulked
in
flesh
until
it
strained
to
burst
its
bounds
and
soar
that
shaped
before
the
poisèd
mind
the
home
of
sleep
far
on
a
moonlit
isle
white
sleep
who
from
heaped
myriad
poppies
weighed
with
baby
slumbers
and
from
violet
beds
culled
whiter
dreams
to
fold
against
her
heart
in
dewy
clusters
sparkling
wet
with
tears
and
on
her
shadowy
pinions
soaring
high
winged
the
vault
into
oblivion
with
all
the
echoes
panting
at
pale
feet
to
kiss
the
dreams
and
deep
waves
far
far
away
lost
and
a
sound
of
stars
streaming
from
burning
sockets
into
night
about
my
soul
about
my
soul
like
fire
oh
then
what
agony
and
bitter
woe
regret
and
noise
of
desolation
vast
as
when
all
that
one
loves
is
torn
away
forever
with
farewell
forevermore
oh
strife
and
panic
and
the
rush
of
winds
moist
ashen
brows
with
raven
tresses
torn
that
plunged
against
the
bursting
bolts
of
god
that
ploughed
the
tempest
curst
with
deepest
night
ruin
and
heartache
moans
and
demon
eyes
fierce
bestial
eyes
that
cursed
at
very
god
then
blinding
tears
that
wept
for
such
and
prayed
tears
blistering
all
the
soul
in
haunting
eyes
eyes
such
as
death
would
fear
to
ponder
on
then
dolorous
battle
as
for
light
folds
of
oblivion
gaspings
silence
death

it

night
and
the
wind
and
the
rushing
of
snow
on
the
wind
and
the
boom
of
the
sea
and
the
moaning
of
desolate
pines
that
were
thinned
and
the
halls
of
fierce
erick
of
sogn
with
the
clamor
of
wassail
were
filled
with
the
clash
of
great
beakers
of
gold
and
the
reek
of
the
ale
that
was
spilled
for
the
yule

upon
them
the
yule
and
they
quaffed
as
from
skulls
of
the
slain
and
sware
out
round
oaths
in
hoarse
wit
and
long
quaffing
sware
laughing
again
unharnessed
from
each
shaggy
throat
that
was
hot
with
mad
lust
and
with
drink
the
burly
wild
skins
and
barbaric
tossed
rent
from
their
broad
golden
link
for
the
yule
was
upon
them
the
yule

the
were
shouted
and
roared
by
the
berserks
the
eaters
of
fire
and
the
jarls
round
the
ponderous
board
and
huge
on
the
hearth
that
writhed
hissing
and
bellied
a
bullion
of
gold
the
the
half
of
an
oak
from
the
mountains
was
royally
rolled
and
its
warmth
was
a
glory
that
glared
and
smote
red
through
the
width
of
the
hall
to
burnish
skins
and
swords
and
great

the
maidens
who
hurried
big
goblets
that
bubbled
excessive
with
barm
blushed
rose
to
the
gold
of
thick
curls
when
the
shining
steel
mirrored
each
charm
and
erick
one
hundred
gray
skalds
at
the
nod
and
the
beck
of
the
king
with
the
stormy
rolled
music
of
an
hundred
wild
harps
made
the
castle
ring
for
the
yule
for
the
yule
was
upon
them
and
battle
and
rapine
were
and
harold
the
viking
the
red
and
his
brother
lay
dead
on
the
shore
for
the
harrier
harold
the
red
and
his
merciless
brother
black
ulf
with
their
men
on
the
shore
of
the
wintery
sea
were
carrion
cold
for
the
wolf
behold
for
the
battle
was
finished
the
battle
that
boomed
in
the
day
with
the
rumble
of
shields
that
were
shocked
and
the
shatter
of
spears
that
did
slay
with
the
hewing
of
swords
that
fierce
lightened
hot
smoking
with
riotous
blood
and
the
crush
of
the
mace
that
was
crashed
through
the
helm
and
the
brain
that
withstood
and
the
cursing
and
shrieking
of
men
at
their
gods
at
their
gods
whom
they
cursed
till
the
caves
of
the
ocean
and
storm
on
their
struggling
burst
and
they
fought
in
the
flying
and
drifting
and
silence
of
covering
snow
till
the
wounded
that
lay
with
the
dead
with
the
dead
were
stiff
frozen
in
woe
and
they
fought
and
the
mystical
flakes
that
were
clutched
of
the
maniac
wind
drave
sharp
on
the
eyes
of
the
kings
made
the
sight
of
their
warriors
blind
and
they
fought
and
with
leonine
wrath
were
they
met
till
the
battle
god
thor
from
his
chariot
rolled
making
end
of
destruction
and
war
and
they
fell
like
twin
rocks
of
the
mountain
the
ruinous
whirlwinds
have
hurled
from
their
crags
to
the
ocean
below
with
the
strength
of
the
world
and
lo
not
in
vain
their
loud
vows
on
the
stern
iron
altars
of
war
their
flesh
their
own
flesh
yea
the
victim
their
blood
the
libation
to
thor
but
a
glitter
and
splendor
of
arms
out
of
snow
and
the
foam
of
the
seas
and
the
terrible
ghosts
of
the
vikings
and
the
gauntleted
valkyries
yea
the
halls
of
fierce
erick
of
sogn
with
the
turmoil
of
wassail
are
filled
with
the
steam
of
the
flesh
of
the
boar
and
the
reek
of
the
ale
that
is
spilled
for
the
yule
and
the
are
theirs
and
the
are
shouted
and
roared
by
the
berserks
the
eaters
of
fire
and
the
jarls
the
ponderous
board
the
troubadour
he
stood
where
all
the
rare
voluptuous
west
like
some
mad
maenad
to
the
breast
shot
from
delirious
lips
of
ruby
must
long
fierce
triumphant
smiles
wherein
hot
lust
swam
like
a
feverish
wine
exultant
tost
high
from
a
golden
goblet
and
so
lost
and
all
the
west
and
all
the
rosy
west
bathed
his
frail
beauty
hair
and
throat
and
breast
and
there
he
bloomed
a
thing
of
rose
and
snows
a
passion
flower
of
men
of
snows
and
rose
beneath
the
casement
of
her
old
red
tower
whereat
the
lady
sat
as
white
a
flower
as
ever
blew
in
provence
and
the
lace
about
her
hair
half
hid
her
face
and
all
its
moods
which
his
sweet
singing
raised
sad
moods
that
censured
it
sweet
moods
that
praised
and
where
the
white
rose
climbing
over
and
over
up
to
her
lattice
like
a
lover
and
gladiolas
and
deep
held
up
for
the
violent
bee
within
her
garden
by
the
ivied
wall
where
many
a
fountain
falling
musical
flamed
in
the
eve
against
it
flung
like
some
mad
nightingale
the
minstrel
sung
the
passion
o
of
plunging
through
and
through
lascivious
curls
as
light
dew
and
jeweled
thick
as
is
the
bosomed
dusk
dense
scintillant
with
stars
oh
frenzy
rare
of
twisting
curling
fingers
in
thy
hair
no
touch
of
winds
from
torrid
seas
were
half
so
in
sorceries
no
life
so
sweet
as
lost
to
lie
wrapped
strand
on
strand
deep
in
such
hair
and
die
ah
love
sweet
love
the
mounting
madness
and
the
rapturous
pain
with
fingers
wound
in
thick
cool
curls
to
strain
all
the
wild
sight
deep
in
thy
perilous
eyes
so
agate
polished
where
the
thoughts
that
rise
warm
in
the
heart
like
on
a
witch
glass
must
forth
in
pictures
beautiful
and
pass
no
siren
sweetness
wailed
to
lyres
of
gold
no
naked
beauty
that
the
greeks
of
old
thro
the
bursting
foam
did
see
were
potent
love
to
tear
mine
eyes
from
thee
ah
love
sweet
love
far
the
sea
of
old
time
once
a
witch
the
fair
ææan
circe
dwelt
so
rich
in
marvelous
magic
cruel
as
a
god
she
made
or
unmade
lovers
at
a
nod
ah
bitter
love
that
made
all
loves
but
brute
ah
bitterer
thou
who
my
heart
a
lute
to
lie
and
languish
for
thee
sad
and
mute
strung
high
for
utterance
of
the
sweetest
lay
such
magic
music
as
acrasia
and
all
her
lovers
swooned
to
utter
bliss
and
then
not
wake
it
with
a
single
kiss
ah
cruel
cruel
love
within
the
grasses
there
against
the
stars
that
now
were
everywhere
flung
thro
the
perfumed
of
angel
hands
and
linked
in
tangled
labyrinths
of
bands
of
soft
flame
and
glimmer
rolled
one
vast
immensity
of
mazy
gold
he
sang
like
some
hurt
creature
desolate
for
the
loss
of
some
wild
mate
hounded
and
speared
to
death
of
heartless
men
in
old
romantic
arden
waste
and
then
turned
to
the
one
white
star
which
like
a
stone
of
precious
worth
low
on
the
heaven
shone
a
white
sweet
lovely
face
and
passed
away
from
the
warm
flowers
and
the
fountains
spray
and
that
fair
lady
in
pale
drapery
high
in
the
quaint
red
tower
did
she
sigh
to
see
him
dimming
down
the
purple
night
lone
with
his
instrument
die
out
of
sight
far
in
the
avenues
far
in
far
in
amid
the
gleaming
dews
and
left
alone
but
with
the
sighing
rush
of
the
wan
fountains
and
the
deep
night
hush
weep
to
the
melancholy
stars
above
half
the
lorn
night
for
the
desired
love
or
down
the
halls
where
arras
old
billowed
with
passage
of
her
fold
on
fold
even
to
the
ponderous
gate
that
shrieked
with
rust
steal
from
her
lord
and
wait
deep
in
the
dingled
hyacinth
and
rose
for
him
who
sang
so
sweetly
erst
who
knows
why
why
smile
high
stars
the
happier
after
rain
why
is
strong
love
the
stronger
after
pain
ai
me
ai
me
thou
wotest
not
nor
i
why
sings
the
wild
swan
heavenliest
when
it
dies
why
spake
the
dumb
lips
sweetest
that
we
prize
for
maddening
memories
o
why
o
why
why
are
dead
kisses
dearer
when
they
dead
why
are
dead
faces
lovelier
vanished
and
why
this
none
can
answer
why
from
unbelief
to
belief
why
come
ye
here
to
sigh
that
i
who
with
crossed
wrists
so
peaceless
lie
before
ye
am
at
rest
at
rest
for
that
the
pistons
of
my
blood
no
more
in
this
machinery
thud
and
on
these
eyes
that
once
were
blest
with
magnetism
of
fire
are
prest
thin
damp
pale
eyelids
for
a
sheath
whereon
the
bony
claw
of
death
hath
set
his
coins
of
unseen
lead
stamped
with
the
image
of
his
head
why
come
ye
here
to
weep
for
one
who
is
forgotten
when
he
gone
from
ye
and
burthened
with
this
rest
your
god
hath
given
him
unsought
of
any
prayers
whiles
yet
he
wrought
and
with
what
sacrifices
bought
low
sweet
communion
mouth
to
mouth
of
thoughts
that
dewed
eternal
drought
of
life
bald
barrenness
a
jest
an
irony
hath
grown
confessed
when
he
at
rest
when
he
at
rest
why
come
ye
fools
ye
lie
ye
lie
rashly
the
grave
for
such
as
i
hath
naught
that
lies
as
near
this
rest
as
your
high
heaven
lies
near
your
hell
i
see
why
now
that
it
is
well
that
men
but
know
the
shell
which
like
a
fruit
the
being
kept
that
swinked
and
sported
woke
and
slept
from
which
that
stern
essential
stept
that
inhabitant
who
makes
me
all
myself
in
all
my
moods
the
original
that
holds
one
orbit
like
a
star
distinct
to
which
a
similar
there
never
was
and
be
there
ca
and
as
it
is
it
is
the
best
that
death
hath
my
poor
body
dressed
in
such
fair
semblance
of
a
rest
which
soothes
the
hearts
of
those
distressed
but
god
unto
the
the
jest
of
this
his
rest
of
this
his
rest
the
king
a
blown
white
bubble
buoyed
up
from
the
tremulous
east
the
round
moon
swung
and
the
unsocial
stars
that
thronged
hot
with
the
drought
thick
down
the
empty
west
winked
thirstily
no
wind
to
rouse
the
leaves
that
the
glaring
road
lolled
palpitant
withered
and
whitened
of
the
weary
dust
from
iron
hoofs
of
that
gay
fellowship
of
knights
which
gat
at
morn
the
king
disguised
whose
mind
was
in
the
lists
to
joust
and
be
an
equal
mid
unequals
man
with
man
who
from
the
towers
of
edric
passed
wherein
some
nights
he
sojourned
till
one
morn
a
horn
sang
at
dim
portals
musical
with
dew
wild
echoes
of
wild
woodlands
and
the
hunt
clear
herald
of
the
staunchest
of
his
knights
and
they
to
the
great
jousts
at
camelot
rode
pounding
off
a
noise
of
steel
and
steeds
thick
in
the
stagnant
moat
the
lilies
lay
ghastly
and
rotting
hoarse
with
rusty
chains
the
drawbridge
hung
before
the
barbed
grate
and
far
above
along
lone
battlements
his
armor
one
great
sentinel
clanked
drowsily
and
it
was
late
in
june
she
at
her
lattice
lawny
leaned
dreaming
of
somewhat
dear
and
happy
smiled
from
glorious
eyes
a
face
like
gracious
nights
one
silent
brilliancy
of
steadfast
stars
innumerable
and
delicate
through
the
dusk
long
loosened
loops
and
coils
of
sensuous
hair
rolled
turbulence
down
naked
neck
and
throat
that
shamed
the
moonshine
with
a
rival
sheen
one
stooped
above
her
till
his
nostrils
drank
rich
faint
perfumes
that
blossomed
in
her
hair
and
her
waist
hooped
one
strong
arm
and
drew
her
mightily
to
him
soft
burying
deep
in
crushed
fresh
linen
warm
with
flesh
his
arm
searched
all
her
eyes
until
his
own
were
drugged
mad
with
their
fire
quick
one
hungry
kiss
like
anger
bruised
fierce
on
her
breathless
lips
whispered
and
but
one
and
he
sweet
sweet
my
lord
thou
wotest
well
and
then
from
love
stern
beauty
writhen
into
gnarled
hideousness
he
haled
her
sweet
white
face
back
back
by
its
large
braids
of
plenteous
hair
till
her
full
bosom
clamorous
speechlessness
stiff
on
the
moon
burst
white
low
mocked
and
laughed
the
king
i
wot
adulteress
and
a
blade
glanced
thin
as
ice
plunged
hard
hard
in
her
heart
