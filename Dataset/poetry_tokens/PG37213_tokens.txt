keating
o
woman
full
of
wiliness
although
for
love
of
me
you
pine
withhold
your
hand
adventurous
it
holdeth
nothing
holding
mine
look
on
my
head
how
it
is
grey
my
body
weakness
doth
appear
my
blood
is
chill
and
thin
my
day
is
done
and
there
is
nothing
here
do
not
call
me
a
foolish
man
nor
lean
your
lovely
cheek
to
mine
o
slender
witch
our
bodies
can
not
mingle
now
nor
any
time
so
take
your
mouth
from
mine
your
hand
from
mine
ah
take
your
lips
away
lest
heat
to
will
should
ripen
and
all
this
be
grave
that
had
been
gay
it
is
this
curl
a
silken
nest
and
this
grey
eye
bright
as
the
dew
and
this
round
lovely
breast
that
draws
desire
in
search
of
you
i
would
do
all
for
you
meseems
but
this
tho
this
were
happiness
i
shall
not
mingle
in
your
dreams
o
woman
full
of
wiliness
mary
hynes
she
is
the
sky
of
the
sun
she
is
the
dart
of
love
she
is
the
love
of
my
heart
she
is
a
rune
she
is
above
the
women
of
the
race
of
eve
as
the
sun
is
above
the
moon
lovely
and
airy
the
view
from
the
hill
that
looks
down
ballylea
but
no
good
sight
is
good
until
by
great
good
luck
you
see
the
blossom
of
the
branches
walking
towards
you
airily
the
coolun
come
with
me
under
my
coat
and
we
will
drink
our
fill
of
the
milk
of
the
white
goat
or
wine
if
it
be
thy
will
and
we
will
talk
until
talk
is
a
trouble
too
out
on
the
side
of
the
hill
and
nothing
is
left
to
do
but
an
eye
to
look
into
an
eye
and
a
hand
in
a
hand
to
slip
and
a
sigh
to
answer
a
sigh
and
a
lip
to
find
out
a
lip
what
if
the
night
be
black
and
the
air
on
the
mountain
chill
where
the
goat
lies
down
in
her
track
and
all
but
the
fern
is
still
stay
with
me
under
my
coat
and
we
will
drink
our
fill
of
the
milk
of
the
white
goat
out
on
the
side
of
the
hill
peggy
mitchell
as
lily
grows
up
easily
in
modest
gentle
dignity
to
sweet
perfection
so
grew
she
as
easily
or
as
the
rose
that
takes
no
care
will
open
out
on
sunny
air
bloom
after
bloom
fair
after
fair
sweet
after
sweet
just
so
did
she
as
carelessly
she
is
our
torment
without
end
she
is
our
enemy
and
friend
our
joy
our
woe
and
she
will
send
madness
or
glee
to
you
and
me
and
endlessly
nancy
walsh
i
without
bite
or
sup
if
thou
wert
fated
for
me
i
would
up
and
would
go
after
thee
through
mountains
a
thousand
thanks
from
me
to
god
have
gone
because
i
have
not
lost
my
senses
to
thee
though
it
was
hardly
i
escaped
from
thee
o
ringleted
one
the
red
man
wife
then
she
arose
and
walked
in
the
valley
in
her
fine
clothes
after
great
fire
great
frost
comes
following
turgesius
was
lost
by
the
daughter
of
maelsheachlin
the
king
by
grainne
of
high
ben
gulbain
in
the
north
was
diarmuid
lost
the
strong
sons
of
ushna
who
never
submitted
they
fell
by
deirdre
nancy
walsh
it
is
not
on
her
gown
she
fears
to
tread
it
is
her
hair
which
tumbles
down
and
strays
about
her
ways
that
she
must
care
and
she
lives
nigh
this
place
the
dead
would
rise
if
they
could
see
her
face
the
dead
would
rise
only
to
hear
her
sing
but
death
is
blind
and
gives
not
ear
nor
eye
to
anything
we
would
leave
behind
both
wife
and
child
and
house
and
home
and
wander
blind
and
wander
thus
and
ever
roam
if
she
would
come
to
us
in
erris
softly
she
said
to
me
be
patient
till
the
night
comes
and
i
will
go
with
thee
anthony
since
your
limbs
were
laid
out
the
stars
do
not
shine
the
fish
leap
not
out
in
the
waves
on
our
meadows
the
dew
does
not
fall
in
the
morn
for
is
dead
not
a
flower
can
be
born
not
a
word
can
be
said
not
a
tree
have
a
leaf
anthony
after
you
there
is
nothing
to
do
there
is
nothing
but
grief
mary
ruane
the
girl
whom
we
knew
she
dressed
herself
to
go
to
the
fair
in
a
dress
of
white
and
blue
a
white
lace
cap
and
ribbons
white
she
wore
in
her
hair
she
does
not
hear
in
the
night
her
mother
crying
for
her
where
deep
down
in
the
sea
she
rolls
and
lingers
to
and
fro
unweariedly
william
the
protecting
tree
of
the
men
of
the
land
of
fál
what
aileth
thee
and
why
is
it
that
all
about
thee
grieves
alas
o
tree
of
the
leaves
here
is
thy
rhyme
thy
bloom
is
lightened
and
if
thy
fruit
be
withered
thy
root
hath
not
tightened
at
the
same
time
not
since
the
gael
was
sold
at
aughrim
not
since
to
cold
dull
death
went
owen
roe
not
since
the
drowning
of
clann
adam
in
the
days
of
noe
brought
men
to
hush
has
such
a
tale
of
woe
come
to
us
in
such
a
rush
the
true
flower
of
the
blood
of
the
place
is
fallen
the
true
of
the
gael
is
reaped
destruction
be
upon
death
for
he
has
come
and
taken
from
our
tree
the
topmost
blackberry
sean
pity
it
was
that
you
should
ever
stand
in
ship
or
boat
or
that
you
went
afloat
inside
that
ship
the
lusty
steps
you
took
the
ways
and
journeys
you
knew
how
to
wend
from
london
back
to
beltra
and
this
end
you
who
could
swim
so
well
what
time
you
sported
in
the
lifting
tides
the
girls
swam
out
to
you
and
held
your
sides
when
they
were
weary
for
they
knew
they
were
safe
because
you
were
there
your
thought
that
this
was
true
and
so
she
made
no
stir
till
you
were
found
although
an
hundred
might
be
drownéd
you
would
come
back
safe
to
her
and
not
be
drowned
the
county
mayo
now
with
the
coming
in
of
the
spring
the
days
will
stretch
a
bit
and
after
the
feast
of
brigid
i
shall
hoist
my
flag
and
go
for
since
the
thought
got
into
my
head
i
can
neither
stand
nor
sit
until
i
find
myself
in
the
middle
of
the
county
of
mayo
in
claremorris
i
would
stop
a
night
and
sleep
with
decent
men
and
then
go
on
to
balla
just
beyond
and
drink
galore
and
next
to
kiltimagh
for
a
visit
of
about
a
month
and
then
i
would
only
be
a
couple
of
miles
away
from
ballymore
i
say
and
swear
my
heart
lifts
up
like
the
lifting
of
a
tide
rising
up
like
the
rising
wind
till
fog
or
mist
must
go
when
i
remember
carra
and
gallen
close
beside
and
the
gap
of
the
two
bushes
and
the
wide
plains
of
mayo
to
killaden
then
to
the
place
where
everything
grows
that
is
best
there
are
raspberries
there
and
strawberries
there
and
all
that
is
good
for
men
and
if
i
were
only
there
in
the
middle
of
my
folk
my
heart
could
rest
for
age
itself
would
leave
me
there
and
i
be
young
again
eileen
diarmuid
and
teig
be
kind
unto
these
three
o
king
for
they
were
cheerful
and
giving
three
stainless
pearls
three
of
mild
winning
ways
three
candles
sending
forth
three
pleasant
rays
three
vines
three
doves
three
apples
from
a
bough
three
graces
in
a
house
three
who
refused
nohow
help
to
the
needy
three
of
slenderness
three
memories
for
the
companionless
three
strings
of
music
three
deep
holes
in
clay
three
lovely
children
who
loved
christ
alway
three
mouths
three
hearts
three
minds
beneath
a
stone
ruin
it
is
three
causes
for
the
moan
that
rises
everywhere
now
they
are
gone
be
kind
o
king
unto
this
two
and
one
honoro
butler
and
lord
kenmare
in
bloom
and
bud
the
bees
are
busily
storing
against
the
winter
their
sweet
hoard
that
shall
be
rifled
ere
the
autumn
be
past
or
the
winter
comes
with
silver
sword
to
fright
the
bees
until
the
merry
round
tells
them
that
sweets
again
are
to
be
found
the
lusty
tide
is
flowing
by
in
ease
telling
of
joy
along
its
brimming
way
far
in
its
waters
is
an
isle
of
trees
whereto
the
sun
will
go
at
end
of
day
as
who
in
secret
place
and
dear
is
hid
and
scarce
can
rouse
him
thence
tho
he
be
chid
now
justice
comes
all
trouble
to
repair
and
cheeks
that
had
been
wan
are
coloured
well
the
untilled
moor
is
comely
and
the
air
hath
a
great
round
of
song
from
bird
in
dell
and
bird
on
wing
and
bird
on
forest
tree
and
from
each
place
and
space
where
bird
may
be
the
languid
are
made
strong

strong
grow
stronger
there
is
no
grievance
here
and
no
distress
the
woeful
are
not
woeful
any
longer
the
rose
hath
put
on
her
a
finer
dress
and
every
girl
to
bloom
adds
bloom
again
and
every
man
hath
heart
beyond
all
men
for
the
star
of
munster

the
golden
bough

joyfully
this
day
of
days
to
wed
her
choice
of
all
whom
fame
hath
loved
till
now
and
who
chose
her
from
all
that
love
instead
the
joy
of
the
flock
the
bud
of
the
branch
is
she
crown
of
the
irish
pride
and
chivalry

a
chief
and
prince
well
famed

he

love
of
thousands
unto
him
does
run
and

their
wine
and
drink
a
merry
health
to
groom
and
bride
they
shall
be
drunken
ere
the
sun
decline
and
all
their
merrymaking
lay
aside
in
deep
sweet
sleep
that
seals
a
merry
day
until
the
dawn
when
they
shall
ride
away
leaving
those
two
who
now
are
one
behind
o
moon
pour
on
the
silence
all
thy
beams
and
for
this
night
be
beautiful
and
kind
weave
in
their
sleep
thy
best
and
dearest
dreams
and
fortune
them
in
their
own
land
to
be
safe
from
all
evil
chance
and
from
all
enmity
clann
cartie
my
heart
is
withered
and
my
health
is
gone
for
they
who
were
not
easy
put
upon
masters
of
mirth
and
of
fair
clemency
masters
of
wealth
and
gentle
charity
they
are
all
gone
mac

of
kanturk
joined
clay
to
clay
and
gat
him
gone
and
bides
as
deep
as
they
their
years
their
gentle
deeds
their
flags
are
furled
and
deeply
down
under
the
stiffened
world
in
chests
of
oaken
wood
are
princes
thrust
to
crumble
day
by
day
into
the
dust
a
mouth
might
puff
at
nor
is
left
a
trace
of
those
who
did
of
grace
all
that
was
grace
o
wave
of
cliona
cease
thy
bellowing
and
let
mine
ears
forget
a
while
to
ring
at
thy
long
lamentable
misery
the
great
are
dead
indeed
the
great
are
dead
and
i
in
little
time
will
stoop
my
head
and
put
it
under
and
will
be
forgot
with
them
and
be
with
them
and
thus

not

thy
long
keening
cry
no
more
end
is
and
here
is
end
and
end
is
sore
and
to
all
lamentation
be
there
end
if
i
might
come
on
thee
o
howling
friend
knowing
that
sails
were
drumming
on
the
sea
westward
to
eiré
and
that
help
would
be
trampling
for
her
upon
a
spanish
deck
i
ram
thy
lamentation
down
thy
neck
the
land
of
fál
if
all
must
suffer
equally
and
pay
in
equal
share
for
that
sin
wrought
by
eve
o
thou
if
thou
wilt
deign
to
answer
say
why
are
the
poor
tormented
why
made
grieve
the
innocent
why
are
the
free
enslaved
why
have
the
wicked
peace
tho
void
of
ruth
why
are
there
none
to
pity
when
dismayed
and
sick
with
fear
the
lamb
bleats
to
the
tooth
that
tears
him
down
why
is
the
cry
unheard
of
lonely
anguish
why
when
the
land
of
fál
had
loved
thee
long
and
well
was
she
not
spared
the
ruin
that
hath
stamped
her
under
all
that
mourn
and
die
inis
fál
now
may
we
turn
aside
and
dry
our
tears
and
comfort
us
and
lay
aside
our
fears
for
all
is
gone
all
comely
quality
all
gentleness
and
hospitality
all
courtesy
and
merriment
is
gone
our
virtues
all
are
withered
every
one
our
music
vanished
and
our
skill
to
sing
now
may
we
quiet
us
and
quit
our
moan
nothing
is
whole
that
could
be
broke
no
thing
remains
to
us
of
all
that
was
our
own
owen
if
poesy
have
truth
at
all
if
some
great
lion
of
the
gael
shall
rule
the
lovely
land
of
fál
o
yellow
mast
and
roaring
sail
carry
the
leadership
for
me
writ
in
this
letter
the
sea
to
great
egan
here
in
a
distant
place
i
hold
my
tongue
i
am
when
i
was
young
who
now
am
young
no
more
i
did
not
eat
things
picked
up
from
the
shore
the
periwinkle
and
the
tough
dogfish
at
have
got
into
my
dish
the
great
where
are
they
now
the
great
had
said
this
is
not
seemly
bring
to
him
instead
that
which
serves
his
and
serves
our
dignity
and
that
was
done
i
am
here
in
a
distant
place
i
hold
my
tongue
who
once
said
all
his
say
when
he
was
young
righteous
anger
the
lanky
hank
of
a
she
in
the
inn
over
there
nearly
killed
me
for
asking
the
loan
of
a
glass
of
beer
may
the
devil
grip
the
slut
by
the
hair
and
beat
bad
manners
out
of
her
skin
for
a
year
that
parboiled
imp
with
the
hardest
jaw
you
will
see
on
virtue
path
and
a
voice
that
would
rasp
the
dead
came
roaring
and
raging
the
minute
she
looked
at
me
and
threw
me
out
of
the
house
on
the
back
of
my
head
if
i
asked
her
master
he
give
me
a
cask
a
day
but
she
with
the
beer
at
hand
not
a
gill
would
arrange
may
she
marry
a
ghost
and
bear
him
a
kitten
and
may
the
high
king
of
glory
permit
her
to
get
the
mange
the
weavers
many
a
time
your
father
gave
me
aid
when
i
was
down
and
now
i
down
again
you
must
take
it
bad
or
be
dismayed
because
i
say
young
folk
should
help
old
men
and
is
their
duty
to
do
that
amen
i
have
no
cows
no
sheep
no
cloak
no
hat
for
those
who
used
to
give
me
things
are
dead
and
my
luck
died
with
them
because
of
that
i
wo
pay
you
a
farthing
but
instead
i
owe
you
till
the
dead
rise
from
the
dead
a
farthing
that
not
much
but
all
the
same
i
have
half
a
farthing
for
that
grand
big
idiot
called
fortune
rigged
the
game
and
gave
me
nothing
while
she
filled
the
hand
of
every
stingy
devil
in
the
land
you
weave
and
i
you
shirts
i
weave
instead
my
careful
verse
but
you
get
paid
at
times
the
only
rap
i
get
is
on
my
head
but
should
it
come
again
that
men
like
rhymes
and
pay
for
them
i
pay
you
for
your
shirt
odell
my
mind
is
sad
and
weary
thinking
how
the
griffins
of
the
gael
went
over
the
sea
from
noble
eiré
and
are
fighting
now
in
france
and
flanders
and
in
germany
if
they
whom
i
sported
without
dread
were
home
i
would
not
mind
what
foe
might
do
or
fear
odell
would
seize
my
bed
to
pay
the
that
is
overdue
i
pray
to
him
who
in
the
haughty
hour
of
babel
threw
confusion
on
each
tongue
that
i
may
see
our
princes
back
in
power
and
see
odell
the
hung
the
apology
do
not
be
distant
with
me
do
not
be
angry
because
i
drank
deep
of
your
wine
but
treat
that
laughing
matter
laughingly
because
i
am
a
poet
and
incline
by
nature
and
by
art
to
jollity
always
i
loved
to
see
i
will
aver
the
good
red
tide
lip
at
the
flagon
brim
sitting
half
fool
and
half
philosopher
chatting
with
every
kind
of
her
and
him
and
shrugged
at
sneer
of
often
enough
i
trudge
by
hedge
and
wall
too
often
there
no
money
in
my
purse
nor
malice
in
my
mind
ever
at
all
and
for
my
songs
no
person
is
the
worse
but
i
who
give
all
of
my
store
to
all
if
busybody
spoke
to
you
of
it
say
kindly
man
if
kindly
man
do
live
the
poet
only
takes
his
sup
and
bit
and
say
it
is
no
great
return
to
give
for
his
unstinted
gift
of
verse
and
wit
the
gang
our
fathers
must
have
sinned
we
pay
for
it
through
them
the
tribe
that
sold
their
king
sneaked
into
power
and
in
high
places
sit
and
do
their
will
and
wish
in
everything
for
they
may
rob
and
kill
grieve
and
disgrace
all
who
are
left
alive
of
eiver
race
they
seized
with
daring
guile
on
rank
and
pelf
and
swore
that
they
would
never
bend
a
knee
unto
the
king
they
robbed
the
church
herself
they
stole
our
princes
lands
and
the
sea
they
packed
those
princes
or
drove
them
away
to
barren
rocks
and
fields
that
have
no
clay
that
spawn
of
base
mechanics
who
could
though
doomsday
came
by
any
art
be
made
noble
are
noble
now
and
have
no
care
snugly
they
sit
and
safe
and
unafraid
in
stately
places
proud
as
if
the
mud
and
slime
that
swills
their
veins
were
princes
blood
let
us
be
wise
and
wary
of
that
gang
when
they
seem
friendly
know
they
have
much
wit
and
if
it
come
that
any
man
shall
hang
this
neck
will
go
unchoked
that
nose
unslit
for
be
things
wry
and
crooked
and
to
guess
those
twisters
are
at
home
in
twistiness
we
know
now
what
their
plottings
were
about
and
how
they
planned
and
what
they
meant
to
win
was
god
not
us
that
took
their
tangles
out
for
no
sleek
eel
inside
an
oily
skin
could
slip
with
more
address
from
harm
than
they
can
slip
from
punishment
and
get
away
when
trouble
came
it
was
their
plan
to
get
our
friends
into
the
boat
they
meant
to
leave
and
there
was
some
one
left
to
pay
their
debt
and
they
were
free
again
to
lie
and
thieve
so
they
could
put
the
feet
of
the
man
they
rob
into
the
boots
of
the
one
that
did
the
job
if
burnt
child
does
truly
dread
the
flame
if
wounded
soldier
shrinks
again
to
see
a
steel
point
sloping
to
him
let
the
same
experience
teach
our
chiefs
that
they
may
be
crafty
in
meeting
craft
and
may
beware
of
brewer
bees
and
buzzers
everywhere
unto
the
mind
which
pardons
sin
i
pray
i
pray
to
him
who
did
permit
our
woe
but
halted
our
destruction
that
kindness
and
love
and
trust
and
inward
glow
of
vision
light
our
hearts
with
light
divine
so
that
we
know
our
way
until
the
end
of
time
the
geraldine
cloak
i
will
not
heed
the
message
which
you
bring
that
lovely
lady
gave
her
cloak
to
us
and
who
believe
she
give
away
a
thing
and
ask
it
back
again
is
fabulous
my
parting
from
her
gave
me
cause
to
grieve
for
she
that
i
was
poor
had
misty
eyes
if
some
archangel
blew
it
i
believe
the
message
which
you
bring
not
otherwise
i
do
not
say
this
just
to
make
a
joke
nor
would
i
rob
her
but
is
verity
so
long
as
i
could
swagger
in
a
cloak
i
never
cared
how
bad
my
luck
could
be
that
lady
all
perfection
knows
the
sting
of
poverty
was
thrust
deep
into
me
i
do
believe
she
do
this
kind
of
thing
or
treat
a
poet
less
than
daintily
a
small
part
only
of
my
grief
i
write
and
if
i
do
not
give
you
all
the
tale
it
is
because
my
gloom
gets
some
respite
by
just
a
small
bewailing
i
bewail
that
i
with
sly
and
stupid
folk
must
bide
who
steal
my
food
and
ruin
my
inside
once
i
had
books
each
book
beyond
compare
but
now
no
book
at
all
is
left
to
me
and
i
am
spied
and
peeped
on
everywhere
and
my
old
head
stuffed
with
latinity
and
with
the
poet
load
of
grave
and
gay
will
not
get
me
for
half
a
day
wild
horse
or
quiet
not
a
horse
have
i
but
to
the
forest
every
day
i
go
bending
beneath
a
load
of
wood
that
high
which
raises
on
my
back
a
sorry
row
of
raw
red
blisters
so
i
cry
alack
the
rider
that
rides
me
will
break
my
back
ossian
when
he
was
old
and
near
his
end
met
patrick
by
good
luck
and
he
was
stayed
i
am
a
poet
too
and
seek
a
friend
a
prop
a
staff
a
comforter
an
aid
a
patrick
who
will
lift
me
from
despair
in
cormac
uasal
mac
donagh
of
the
golden
hair
blue
blood
we
thought
at
first
this
man
is
a
king
for
sure
or
the
branch
of
a
mighty
and
ancient
and
famous
lineage
that
silly
sulky
illiterate
boor
who
was
hatched
by
foreign
vulgarity
under
a
hedge
the
good
men
of
clare
were
drinking
his
health
in
a
flood
and
gazing
with
me
in
awe
at
the
princely
lad
and
asking
each
other
from
what
bluest
blueness
of
blood
his
daddy
was
squeezed
and
the
pa
of
the
da
of
his
dad
we
waited
there
gaping
and
wondering
anxiously
until
he
stop
eating
and
let
the
glad
tidings
out
and
the
booby
proved
to
the
hilt
that
he
was
lout
son
of
lout
by
old
lout
and
was
da
to
a
lout
i
will
sing
no
more
songs
the
pride
of
my
country
i
sang
through
forty
long
years
of
good
rhyme
without
any
avail
and
no
one
cared
even
as
much
as
the
half
of
a
hang
for
the
song
or
the
singer
so
here
is
an
end
to
the
tale
if
a
person
should
think
i
complain
and
have
not
got
the
cause
let
him
bring
his
eyes
here
and
take
a
good
look
at
my
hand
let
him
say
if
a
has
calloused
this
poor
pair
of
paws
or
the
spade
that
i
grip
on
and
dig
with
out
there
in
the
land
when
the
great
ones
were
safe
and
renowned
and
were
rooted
and
tough
though
my
mind
went
to
them
and
took
joy
in
the
fortune
of
those
and
pride
in
their
pride
and
their
fame
they
gave
little
enough
not
as
much
as
two
boots
for
my
feet
or
an
old
suit
of
clothes
i
ask
of
the
craftsman
that
fashioned
the
fly
and
the
bird
of
the
champion
whose
passion
will
lift
me
from
death
in
a
time
of
the
spirit
that
melts
icy
hearts
with
the
wind
of
a
word
that
my
people
be
worthy
and
get
better
singing
than
mine
i
had
hoped
to
live
decent
when
ireland
was
quit
of
her
care
as
a
bailiff
or
steward
perhaps
in
a
house
of
degree
but
my
end
of
the
tale
is
old
brogues
and
old
britches
to
wear
so
i
sing
no
more
songs
for
the
men
that
care
nothing
for
me
note
this
book
ought
to
be
called
loot
or
plunder
or
pieces
of
eight
or
or
some
name
which
would
indicate
and
get
away
from
its
source
for
although
everything
in
it
can
be
referred
to
the
irish
of
from
one
hundred
to
three
hundred
years
ago
the
word
translation
would
be
a
misdescription
there
are
really
only
two
translations
in
it
keating
o
woman
full
of
wiliness
and
raftery
county
mayo
some
of
the
poems
owe
no
more
than
a
phrase
a
line
half
a
line
to
the
irish
and
around
these
scraps
i
have
blown
a
bubble
of
verse
and
made
my
poem
in
other
cases
where
the
matter
of
the
poem
is
almost
entirely
taken
from
the
irish
i
have
yet
followed
my
own
instinct
in
the
arrangement
of
it
and
the
result
might
be
called
new
poems
my
first
idea
was
to
make
an
anthology
of
people
whom
long
ago
our
poets
had
praised
so
that
in
another
language
and
another
time
these
honoured
names
might
be
heard
again
even
though
in
my
own
terms
and
not
in
the
historic
context
i
did
not
pursue
this
course
for
i
could
not
control
the
material
which
came
to
me
and
which
took
no
heed
of
my
plan
and
was
just
as
interesting
it
would
therefore
be
a
mistake
to
consider
that
these
verses
are
representative
of
the
poets
by
whom
they
are
inspired
in
the
case
of
david
this
is
less
true
than
in
any
of
the
others
but
even
in
his
case
although
i
have
often
conveyed
his
matter
almost
verbatim
the
selection
is
not
representative
of
the
poet
one
side
only
and
that
the
least
is
shown
for
a
greater
pen
than
mine
would
be
necessary
if
that
tornado
of
rage
eloquence
and
humour
were
to
be
presented
but
the
poems
which
i
give
might
almost
be
taken
as
translations
of
one
side
of
his
terrific
muse
as
regards
egan
a
similar
remark
is
necessary
no
pen
and
no
language
but
his
own
could
even
distantly
indicate
a
skill
and
melody
which
might
be
spoken
of
as
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
i
have
done
exactly
as
i
pleased
with
his
material
from
antoine
i
have
taken
more
than
from
any
of
the
others
and
have
in
nearly
every
instance
treated
his
matter
so
familiarly
that
a
lover
of
raftery
and
who
having
read
a
verse
of
his
does
not
love
him
might
not
know
i
was
indebted
to
this
poet
for
my
songs
his
work
is
different
from
that
of
keating
or
for
these
were
learned
men
and
were
writing
out
of
a
tradition
so
hoary
with
age
and
so
complicated
in
convention
that
only
learned
and
subtle
minds
could
attempt
it
i
have
wondered
would
keating
or
have
been
very
scornful
of
raftery
work
i
think
they
might
have
been
angry
at
such
an
ignorance
of
all
the
rules
and
would
probably
have
torn
the
paper
on
which
his
poems
were
written
and
sat
down
to
compose
a
satire
which
would
have
raised
blisters
on
that
poor
blind
wandering
singer
the
master
of
them
all
in
two
of
the
poems
which
i
tried
to
translate
from
raftery
i
have
completely
failed
against
one
of
them
i
broke
an
hundred
pens
in
vain
and
in
the
other
the
county
mayo
i
have
been
so
close
to
success
and
so
far
from
succeeding
that
i
may
mourn
a
little
about
it
the
first
three
verses
are
not
bad
but
the
last
verse
is
the
completest
miss
the
simplicity
of
the
original
is
there
its
music
is
not
and
in
the
last
two
lines
the
poignance
which
should
come
on
the
reader
as
though
a
hand
gripped
at
his
heart
is
absent
the
other
failure
i
have
not
printed
because
i
could
get
no
way
on
it
at
all
it
would
not
even
begin
to
translate
this
is
raftery
reply
to
the
man
who
did
not
recognise
him
as
he
fiddled
to
a
crowd
and
asked
who
is
the
musician
i
am

as
these
poets

from

they
are
alike
in
that
they
were
all
poor
men
so
poor
that
there
was

little
difference
between
them
and
beggars
they
all
