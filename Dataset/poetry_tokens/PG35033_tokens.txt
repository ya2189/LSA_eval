a
legend
of
anne
part
i
little
white
crow
was
an
algonkin
and
he
lived
on
the
isle
of
chips
his
legs
were
long
and
his
flanks
were
thin
he
had
high
and
a
strong
square
chin
jet
black
was
his
hair
dark
red
was
his
skin
and
white
were
his
teeth
when
a
joyful
grin
at
the
sound
of
the
hideous
din
parted
his
silent
lips
three
feathers
adorned
his
head
well
greased
was
his
snaky
hair
his
face
was
daubed
with
black
and
with
red
no
trousers
he
wore
but
fringed
leggings
instead
and
moccasins
with
quills
for
thread
very
proud
was
his
look
very
stately
his
tread
and
of
this
he
was
fully
aware
little
white
crow
had
a
sharp
a
carbine
and
powder
and
shot
and
the
scalps
of
the
braves
whom
sent
below
hung
at
his
girdle
a
goodly
row
a
bag
where
he
was
wont
to
stow
charms
against
famine
and
fever
and
foe
and
over
his
shoulders
he
used
to
throw
a
robe
on
occasions
of
show
oh
a
very
fine
fellow
was
little
white
crow
if
curious
to
learn
why
they
christened
him
so
the
indian
department
might
possibly
know
ask
deputy
minister
scott
father
le
cocq
was
a
priest
from
quebec
rather
spindle
of
shank
rather
scraggy
of
neck
a
stoop
in
the
shoulder
was
yellow
of
skin
with
closely
cut
hair
and
a
smooth
shaven
chin
he
had
very
black
eyes
and
a
rather
red
nose
wore
shoes
with
steel
buckles
and
very
square
toes
a
big
shovel
hat
a
black
cassock
and
bands
and
a
rosary
seldom
was
out
of
his
hands
but
loyola
never
and
nowhere
than
he
had
a
loyaller
or
a
more
staunch
devotee
and
none
carried
further
the
jesuit
virtue
viz
as
bid
and
cry
if
it
hurt
you
though
gentle
by
nature
and
fond
of
his
ease
he
would
work
like
a
slave
his
superior
to
please
he
would
shrink
from
no
danger
pain
toil
or
disgrace
or
would
swear
wrong
was
right
until
black
in
the
face
as
wise
as
a
serpent
as
firm
as
a
rock
yet
as
meek
as
a
dove
was
good
father
le
cocq
with
bell
book
and
candle
the
priest
had
been
sent
to
banks
with
the
pious
intent
to
find
if
he
could
after
diligent
search
a
few
stray
red
sheep
for
the
fold
of
the
church
and
there
in
a
cabin
of
poles
and
of
bark
he
sang
hymns
and
said
masses
from
daylight
to
dark
it
happened
one
day
that
good
father
le
cocq
had
been
visiting
some
of
the
lambs
of
his
flock
and
homeward
returning
his
pious
task
done
was
paddling
along
at
the
set
of
the
sun
now
a
man
may
be
virtuous
learned
austere
in
religion
devout
and
in
morals
severe
yet
as
strange
and
sad
as
true
able
to
manage
a
birch
bark
canoe
so
now
the
paddle
by
no
means
a
dab
he
caught
what
is
vulgarly
known
as
a
his
balance
he
lost
the
canoe
was
upset
and
father
le
cocq
tumbled
into
the
wet
poor
father
le
cocq
any
chance
would
have
fancied
for
certain
his
usefulness
gone
and
indeed
the
chance
was
uncommonly
slim
the
current
ran
fast
not
a
stroke
could
he
swim
and
he
thought
all
was
over
in
this
world
for
him
but
thanks
to
francis
anne
ignatius
or
some
saintly
personage
equally
gracious
it
happened
that
not
fifty
paces
below
behind
a
big
boulder
sat
little
white
crow
he
was
fishing
for
trout
and
i
wish
i
could
catch
in
these
days
of
another
such
batch
the
rock
as
said
hid
the
priest
from
his
view
but
he
heard
a
great
splash
and
he
saw
a
canoe
float
down
bottom
upwards
while
close
behind
that
swam
jauntily
after
big
shovel
hat
no
moment
to
ponder
paused
little
white
crow
he
sprang
from
the
bank
like
a
shaft
from
a
bow
he
could
swim
like
a
mallard
and
dive
like
a
loon
but
he
reached
the
poor
priest
not
a
moment
too
soon
caught
hold
of
his
cassock
and
collared
him
fast
just
while
he
was
sinking
the
third
time
and
last
then
reaching
the
shore
dragged
the
poor
father
out
as
land
a
remarkably
overgrown
trout
needless
to
mention
that
little
white
crow
did
not
know
and
could
not
be
expected
to
know
doctor
marshall
method
so
justly
renowned
for
restoring
to
life
the
apparently
drowned
but
he
worked
in
his
own
way
with
such
a
good
will
he
rubbed
and
he
chafed
with
such
zeal
and
such
skill
that
the
priest
after
heaving
some
very
deep
sighs
first
yawned
and
then
groaned
and
then
opened
his
eyes
little
simple
means
as
completely
succeeded
as
ever
the
treatment
of
any
did
where
credit
is
due
determined
to
give
it
and
the
priest
before
long
was
as
right
as
a
trivet
friend
and
preserver
you
very
well
know
thus
the
father
the
addressed
of
gold
and
of
silver
none
to
bestow
in
return
for
the
life
that
to
you
i
must
here
he
drew
a
silk
bag
from
his
breast
one
precious
treasure
i
beg
and
here
overcome
by
emotion
he
wept
then
he
took
a
small
object
from
out
of
the
bag
which
he
carefully
wiped
with
a
small
piece
of
rag
a
moment
he
tenderly
gazed
on
it
he
kissed
it
with
fervour
again
and
again
one
last
lingering
look
of
affection
so
he
handed
it
over
to
little
white
crow
with
stately
politeness
the
indian
received
the
treasure
so
prized
and
at
once
he
perceived
with
some
disappointment
to
tell
you
the
truth
badly
decayed
rather
large
double
your
estimation
i
very
much
fear
thus
gravely
the
father
began
of
all
value
my
gift
will
appear
but
when
you
have
heard
me
its
worth
will
be
clear
a
relic
of
holy
saint
anne
to
tell
half
its
virtues
all
night
would
require
an
excellent
cure
for
the
vapours
heal
any
dropsy
no
matter
how
dire
put
out
the
last
spark
of
saint
fire
and
stop
all
saint
capers
the
twinges
of
toothache
so
hard
to
endure
the
quinsy
the
gout
and
the
spleen
the
scurvy
the
jaundice
all
these
it
will
cure
while
to
break
up
an
ague
find
it
more
and
a
great
deal
more
cheap
quinine
short
there
is
nothing
need
cause
you
alarm
so
long
as
this
relic
you
wear
find
it
indeed
an
infallible
charm
against
every
conceivable
species
of
harm
to
which
poor
he
ceased
the
gravely
smiled
and
gravely
shook
his
head
and
then
the
simple
forest
child
addressed
the
priest
in
accents
mild
and
this
is
what
he
said
uncle
thinks
easy
to
gull
little
white
crow
i
ween
hollow
and
empty
he
deems
his
skull
he
fancies
his
wits
are
all
gone
dull
wrong
he
grinned
and
without
any
further
delay
put
the
tooth
in
his
bag
safely
away
and
then
with
a
gesture
more
free
than
polite
clapped
the
priest
on
the
shoulder
and
wished
him
part
ii
a
year
and
a
day
a
year
and
a
day
how
the
days
and
the
weeks
and
the
months
roll
away
how
little
we
know
what
of
joy
or
of
sorrow
lies
before
us
next
no
time
to
moralize
well
a
year
and
a
day
had
elapsed
as
stated
since
the
incidents
happened
i
lately
related
little
white
crow
and
a
score
of
his
friends
to
further
their
own
individual
ends
and
those
of
their
neighbours
as
well
no
doubt
deep
loaded
with
furs
for
quebec
had
set
out
been
rather
more
lucky
than
usual
i
think
in
hunting
the
beaver
the
bear
and
the
mink
and
their
spoils
at
quebec
they
intended
to
trade
for
the
goods
of
the
french
which
long
habit
had
made
if
not
indispensable
still
very
handy
knives
gunpowder
kettles
beads
bullets
and
brandy
to
keep
to
my
story
our
friends
on
this
day
down
the
river
were
calmly
pursuing
their
way
when
little
white
crow
in
the
foremost
canoe
was
startled
to
hear
a
wild
hullabaloo
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
he
shaded
his
eyes
then
cried
in
a
voice
of
alarm
and
we
all
use
strong
words
when
things
happen
to
plague
us
bother
it
here
are
those
onondagas
he
said
and
with
yells
of
defiance
the
crews
paddled
quickly
ashore
and
pulled
up
their
canoes
oh
pleasant
it
is
through
the
forest
to
stray
in
the
gladsome
month
of
june
to
list
to
the
scream
of
the
merry
blue
jay
and
the
chirp
of
the
squirrel
so
blithe
and
gay
and
the
sigh
of
the
soft
south
winds
that
play
in
the
top
of
the
pine
trees
tall
and
grey
a
sweet
regretful
tune
and
pleasant
it
is
a
forest
lake
through
the
cool
white
mists
to
glide
ere
the
bright
warm
day
is
half
awake
when
the
trout
the
glassy
surface
break
and
the
doe
comes
down
her
thirst
to
slake
with
her
dappled
fawn
by
her
side
where
the
loud
laugh
rings
wild
and
clear
where
the
black
duck
rears
her
brood
where
the
tall
blue
heron
with
mien
austere
poised
on
one
leg
at
the
marge
of
the
mere
muses
in
solitude
yes
sweet
and
fair
are
the
forest
glades
where
the
rude
clamours
cease
where
no
harsh
workaday
sound
invades
the
sabbath
rest
of
the
solemn
shades
a
paradise
of
peace
but
oh
a
different
thing
when
one
knows
that
each
bush
is
an
ambush
concealing
foes
when
the
sweet
flowers
are
choked
by
the
sulphurous
breath
of
the
musket
whose
mouth
is
the
portal
of
death
when
instead
of
the
song
of
the
frolicsome
bird
shots
shrieks
yells
and
curses
alone
can
be
heard
then
the
sweet
tinkle
seems
changed
to
a
knell
and
the
deep
gloom
to
the
blackness
of
hell
little
white
crow
at
the
close
of
the
day
with
a
handful
of
comrades
was
standing
at
bay
things
had
gone
with
them
badly
they
were
but
a
score
and
the
enemy
numbered
a
hundred
or
more
now
flushed
with
success
and
of
victory
sure
the
iroquois
thinking
their
triumph
secure
were
preparing
to
deal
one
last
finishing
blow
to
annihilate
utterly
little
white
crow
poor
little
white
crow
though
a
of
men
he
hardly
looked
like
an
apostle
just
then
been
dodging
all
day
behind
rock
bush
and
tree
a
cunning
old
fox
in
a
scrimmage
was
he
but
numbers
will
tell
in
the
long
run
and
now
with
hate
in
his
heart
and
revenge
on
his
brow
with
his
knife
in
his
teeth
and
his
gun
in
his
hand
as
he
urged
on
his
comrades
to
make
one
last
stand
though
his
bullets
were
spent
and
their
arrows
all
he
looked
more
like
old
nick
afraid
than
saint
john
little
white
crow
had
poured
into
his
gun
his
last
charge
of
powder
but
bullets
none
he
searched
in
his
shot
pouch
again
and
again
he
begged
of
his
comrades
but
begged
all
in
vain
among
the
whole
party
in
fact
there
was
not
so
much
as
one
pellet
of
no
shot
he
was
just
giving
up
the
whole
job
in
disgust
when
his
hand
in
his
bag
chancing
to
thrust
as
fortune
would
have
it
his
fingers
he
ran
against
the
back
tooth
of
the
blessed
saint
anne
little
white
crow
gave
a
terrible
shout
the
tooth
in
a
trice
from
the
bag
he
whipped
out
dropped
it
into
his
musket
and
yelling
still
louder
he
rammed
it
well
home
on
the
top
of
the
powder
but
here
come
the
foe
from
rocks
bushes
and
trees
they
start
like
a
swarm
of
exasperate
bees
a
capital
simile
that
is
in
any
case
to
describe
an
assault
of
oneidas
or
senecas
and
one
as
it
happens
remarkably
apt
in
this
particular
case
for
the
iroquois
captain
was
a
chief
called
big
hornet
beggar
to
fight
who
measured
six
feet
and
some
inches
in
height
he
gave
the
signal
to
make
the
attack
he
led
the
rush
of
the
bloodthirsty
pack
and
he
as
he
charged
in
the
front
of
the
foe
attracted
the
notice
of
little
white
crow
little
white
crow
brought
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
and
rested
the
barrel
on
top
of
a
boulder
singled
out
the
big
conspicuous
figure
drew
a
bead
on
his
forehead
then
pulled
the
trigger
went
the
flint
lock
and
the
musket
went
the
forest
around
with
the
loud
echo
rang
the
gun
burst
to
atoms
so
great
was
the
shock
and
vanished
entirely
lock
barrel
and
stock
while
wholly
uninjured
incredible
though
it
seems
i
acknowledge
was
little
white
crow
but
the
iroquois
chief
gave
a
horrible
yell
he
threw
up
his
arms
and
then
backward
he
fell
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
fell
backward
again
he
rolled
and
he
writhed
and
he
wriggled
with
pain
his
friends
gathered
round
him
and
started
aghast
at
seeing
a
to
his
nose
sticking
fast
they
cried
smitten
with
panic
let
us
fly
to
the
distant
hills
the
devil
is
fighting
against
us
our
foemen
are
shedding
their
teeth
as
they
say
that
the
porcupine
sheds
its
quills
and
shaking
with
terror
away
they
all
ran
big
hornet
as
usual
leading
the
van
while
astride
on
his
nose
sat
the
tooth
of
saint
anne
part
iii
in
the
iroquois
towns
very
deep
was
the
grief
when
they
heard
of
the
pitiful
plight
of
their
chief
there
a
woman
in
all
the
five
nations
who
indulge
in
prolonged
lamentations
they
tried
to
relieve
him
but
tried
all
in
vain
the
tenderest
touch
produced
exquisite
pain
the
men
tried
incantations
and
sorceries
and
yet
though
their
magic
as
strong
as
a
hawser
is
the
tooth
budge
for
the
best
of
the
lot
the
more
they
incanted
the
tighter
it
got
a
dutchman
from
albany
came
to
their
aid
who
had
once
been
a
student
of
medicine
at
leyden
he
practised
in
vain
each
resource
of
his
trade
and
swore
that
the
tooth
by
the
foul
fiend
was
made
while
its
carious
cavity
was
so
he
said
a
hole
for
the
devil
to
hide
in
big
hornet
meanwhile
grew
haggard
and
grey
with
grief
and
chagrin
he
was
wasting
away
his
friends
found
their
efforts
all
powerless
to
save
their
chief
in
his
rapid
descent
to
the
grave
there
was
nobody
able
to
set
the
tooth
free
it
clung
like
a
little
old
man
of
the
sea
it
happened
one
day
there
was
brought
to
the
town
a
captive
french
priest
in
a
shabby
black
gown
he
had
very
black
eyes
and
a
rather
red
nose
wore
shoes
with
steel
buckles
and
very
square
toes
a
stoop
in
the
shoulder
was
yellow
of
skin
and
a
growth
of
bristles
disfigured
his
chin
alas
and
alack
it
was
father
le
cocq
the
iroquois
wolves
had
both
harried
the
flock
and
kidnapped
the
doomed
to
be
fried
as
soon
as
it
suited
the
heathen
oneidas
now
just
as
a
drowning
man
grabs
at
a
straw
his
aid
was
besought
by
the
favourite
squaw
of
the
sick
doubt
at
some
kind
suggestion
to
specify
which
is
quite
out
of
the
question
frenchman
remove
the
excrescence
that
grows
so
horribly
tight
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
and
home
to
your
friends
you
shall
safely
return
instead
of
remaining
among
us
to
burn
thus
urged
the
good
jesuit
followed
the
squaw
but
oh
his
bewilderment
wonder
and
awe
no
tongue
can
describe
and
no
pencil
can
paint
when
lifting
his
hands
in
amazement
he
saw
on
the
nose
of
the
the
tooth
of
the
saint
but
father
le
cocq
long
at
a
loss
he
made
on
the
relic
the
sign
of
the
cross
when
wondrous
to
hear
and
amazing
to
tell
the
tooth
from
the
nose
incontinent
fell
and
the
chief
from
that
moment
began
to
get
well
my
story
is
told
no
more
to
relate
the
iroquois
sent
back
the
father
in
state
they
feasted
him
daily
as
long
as
tarry
then
gave
him
more
furs
than
he
knew
how
to
carry
and
safe
in
his
bosom
thrice
fortunate
man
he
bore
the
back
tooth
of
the
blessed
saint
anne
as
for
little
white
crow
from
that
day
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
was
known
as
the
best
a
friend
of
french
missions
he
called
himself
and
he
without
any
doubt
was
a
friend
of
french
brandy
at
the
close
of
a
well
spent
career
the
old
man
had
a
collection
of
scalps
quite
unequalled
in
canada
but
never
again
did
he
venture
to
sneer
at
the
bones
of
the
saints
looked
they
never
so
queer
he
often
would
say
that
his
good
luck
began
on
the
day
he
received
the
back
tooth
of
saint
anne
and
for
all
his
successes
he
piously
thanked
it
he
died

years

of
adam
wright
as
a
watch
in
the
night
the
soldier
called
from
rest
or
play
to
take
his
post
as
sentinel
to
guard
until
the
break
of
day
some
citadel
springs
to
his
arms
with
beating
heart
to
take
some
place
proud
to
perform
a
part
dreading
what
yet
he
dares
to
face
his
footsteps
on
his
ears
ring
fainter
and
fainter
silence
falls
about
him
moments
seem
like
years
and
loneliness
his
soul
appals
but
when
the
signal
rockets
flare
he
strains
his
eyes
the
void
to
scan
when
sounds
of
battle
fill
the
air
in
face
of
death
he
plays
the
man
he
stays
where
duty
bids
him
stay
the
boldest
when
he
fears
the
most
and
rounds
come
they
may
find
him
alert
and
at
his
post
unnumbered
now
the
moments
fly
by
him
whose
thoughts
are
set
upon
each
task
the
eastern
sky
brightens
with
dawn
the
night
is
gone
and
hark
at
last
he
grows
aware
of
footsteps
his
release
that
tell
clear
rings
his
challenge
goes
there

to
from
mists
across
the
sea
you
bore
the
sacred
fire
kindled
by
him
whose
name
has
made
the
century
famous
with
his
fame
and
bid
our
lamp
burn
brighter
than
before
upon
our
tree
a
branch
from
shore
you
grafted
and
behold
our
tree
became
wanton
in
leafage
with
blossoms
all
aflame
deep
rooted
and
with
boughs
to
heaven
that
soar
we
see
the
better
issue
from
the
strife
and
hope
the
best
in
loathsome
crawling
things
we
feel
the
fluttering
of
jewelled
wings
in
score
with
seeming
discords
rife
we
seek
to
read
with
you
the
note
that
brings
to
harmony
the
jarring
chords
