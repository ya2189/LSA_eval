the
following
poems
were
written
originally
for
the
amusement
of
the
author
as
they
were
the
products
of
her
leisure
moments
she
had
no
intention
ever
to
have
published
them
nor
would
they
now
have
made
their
appearance
but
at
the
importunity
of
many
of
her
best
and
most
generous
friends
to
whom
she
considers
herself
as
under
the
greatest
obligations
as
her
attempts
in
poetry
are
now
sent
into
the
world
it
is
hoped
the
critic
will
not
severely
censure
their
defects
and
we
presume
they
have
too
much
merit
to
be
cast
aside
with
contempt
as
worthless
and
trifling
effusions
as
to
the
disadvantages
she
has
laboured
under
with
regard
to
learning
nothing
needs
to
be
offered
as
her
master
letter
in
the
following
page
will
sufficiently
show
the
difficulties
in
this
respect
she
had
to
encounter
with
all
their
imperfections
the
poems
are
now
humbly
submitted
to
the
perusal
of
the
public
the
following
is
a
copy
of
a

by
the
author

the

phillis
was
brought
from
africa
to
america
in
the
year
between
seven
and
eight
years
of
age
without
any
assistance
from
school
education
and
by
only
what
she
was
taught
in
the
family
she
in
sixteen
months
time
from
her
arrival
attained
the
english
language
to
which
she
was
an
utter
stranger
before
to
such
a
degree
as
to
read
any
the
most
difficult
parts
of
the
sacred
writings
to
the
great
astonishment
of
all
who
heard
her
as
to
her
writing
her
own
curiosity
led
her
to
it
and
this
she
learnt
in
so
short
a
time
that
in
the
year
she
wrote
a
letter
to
the
rev
occom
the
indian
minister
while
in
england
she
has
a
great
inclination
to
learn
the
latin
tongue
and
has
made
some
progress
in
it
this
relation
is
given
by
her
master
who
bought
her
and
with
whom
she
now
lives

to
the
public
as
it
has
been
repeatedly
suggested
to
the
publisher
by
persons
who
have
seen
the
manuscript
that
numbers
would
be
ready
to
suspect
they
were
not
really
the
writings
of
phillis
he
has
procured
the
following
attestation
from
the
most
respectable
characters
in
boston
that
none
might
have
the
least
ground
for
disputing
their
original
we
whose
names

do
assure
the
world
that
the
poems
specified
in
the
following
page
were
as
we
verily
believe
written
by
phillis
a
young
negro
girl
who
was
but
a
few
years
since
brought
an
uncultivated
barbarian
from
africa
and
has
ever
since
been
and
now
is
under
the
disadvantage
of
serving
as
a
slave
in
a

of

the
coat
the

he
laid
aside
nor
chose
to
venture
with
those

untry
then
took
his
staff
and
to
the
brook
instant
he
ran
and
thence
five
pebbles
took

time
descended
to

defend
proud
as
thou
art
in

great
i
come
to

thee
thine
approaching
fate
regard
my

the
judge
of
all
the

beneath
whose

the
mountain
nods
will
give
thine
armies
to
the
savage
brood
that
cut
the
liquid
air
or
range
the
wood
thee
too
a
pebble
shall
destroy
and
thou
shalt
perish
by
a
beardless
boy
such
is
the
mandate
from
the
realms
above
and
should
i
try
the
vengeance
to
remove
myself
a
rebel
to
my

would
prove
goliath
say
shall
grace
to
him
be
shown
who
dares
monarch
and
insults
his
throne
your
words
are
lost
on
me
the
giant
cries
while
fear
and
wrath
contended
in
his
eyes
when
thus
the
messenger
from
replies
provoke
no
more
jehovah
awful
hand
to
hurl
its
vengeance
on
thy
guilty
land
he
grasps
the
thunder
and
he
wings
the
storm
servants
their
orders
to
perform
the
angel
spoke
and
turn
his
eyes
away
adding
new
radiance
to
the
rising
day
now
david
comes
the
fatal
stones
demand
his
left
the
staff
engag
his
better
hand
the
giant
mov
and
from
his
height
survey
the
stripling
and
disdain
the
fight
and
thus
began
am
i
a
dog
with
thee
thou
no
armour
but
a
staff
to
me
the
gods
on
thee
their
vollied
curses
pour
and
beasts
and
birds
of
prey
thy
flesh
devour
david
undaunted
thus
thy
spear
and
shield
shall
no
protection
to
thy
body
yield
jehovah
name
no
other
arms
i
bear
i
ask
no
other
in
this
glorious
war
the
lord
of
hosts
to
me
will
give
thy
doom
thou
shalt
receive
the
fate
you
threaten
shall
your
own
become
and
beasts
shall
be
your
animated
tomb
that
all
the
earth
inhabitants
may
know
that
there
a

who
governs
all
below
this
great
assembly
too
shall

hand
the
battle
his
the
conquest
he
bestows
and
to
our
consigns
our
hated
foes
thus
david
spoke
goliath
heard
and
came
to
meet
the
hero
in
the
field
of
fame
ah
fatal
meeting
to
thy
troops
and
thee
but
thou
wast
deaf
to
the
divine
decree
young
david
meets
thee
meets
thee
not
in
vain
is
thine
to
perish
on
th
ensanguin
plain
and
now
the
youth
the
forceful
pebble
slung
philistia
trembled
as
it
whizz
along
in
his
dread
forehead
where
the
helmet
ends
just
the
brows
the
stone
descends
it
pierc
the
skull
and
shatter
all
the
brain
prone
on
his
face
he
tumbled
to
the
plain
goliath
fall
no
smaller
terror
yields
than
riving
thunders
in
aerial
fields
the
soul
still
in
its
lov
abode
till
david
the
giant
strode
goliath
sword
then
laid
its
master
dead
and
from
the
body
hew
the
ghastly
head
the
blood
in
gushing
torrents
drench
the
plains
the
soul
found
passage
through
the
spouting
veins
and
now
aloud
th
illustrious
victor
said
where
are
your
boastings
now
your
dead
scarce
had
he
spoke
when
the
philistines
fled
but
fled
in
vain
the
swift
pursu
what
scenes
of
slaughter
and
what
seas
of
blood
there
saul
thy
thousands
grasp
th
impurpled
sand
in
pangs
of
death
the
conquest
of
thine
hand
and
david
there
were
thy
ten
thousands
laid
thus
israel
damsels
musically
play
near
gath
and
edron
many
an

lay
breath
out
their
souls
and
curs
the
light
of

their
fury
quench
by
death
no
longer
burns
and
david
with
goliath
head
returns
to
salem
brought
but
in
his
tent
he
the
load
of
armour
which
the
giant
grac
his
monarch
saw
him
coming
from

and
thus
demanded
of
the

this
amazing

cry
when
thus
the
leader
of
the
host

he
sprung
so
great
in
prowess
though
in

the

say
of
what
