a
boy
will
by
robert
frost
contents
part
i
into
my
own
the
youth
is
persuaded
that
he
will
be
rather
more
than
less
himself
for
having
forsworn
the
world
ghost
house
he
is
happy
in
society
of
his
choosing
my
november
guest
he
is
in
love
with
being
misunderstood
love
and
a
question
he
is
in
doubt
whether
to
admit
real
trouble
to
a
place
beside
the
hearth
with
love
a
late
walk
he
courts
the
autumnal
mood
stars
there
is
no
oversight
of
human
affairs
storm
fear
he
is
afraid
of
his
own
isolation
wind
and
window
flower
out
of
the
winter
things
he
fashions
a
story
of
modern
love
to
the
thawing
wind
audio
he
calls
on
change
through
the
violence
of
the
elements
a
prayer
in
spring
he
discovers
that
the
greatness
of
love
lies
not
in
thoughts
nor
yet
in
any
spur
it
may
be
to
ambition
rose
pogonias
he
is
no
dissenter
from
the
ritualism
of
nature
asking
for
roses
nor
from
the
ritualism
of
youth
which
is
waiting
afield
at
dusk
he
arrives
at
the
turn
of
the
year
in
a
vale
out
of
old
longings
he
fashions
a
story
a
dream
pang
he
is
shown
by
a
dream
how
really
well
it
is
with
him
in
neglect
he
is
scornful
of
folk
his
scorn
can
not
reach
the
vantage
point
and
again
scornful
but
there
is
no
one
hurt
mowing
he
takes
up
life
simply
with
the
small
tasks
going
for
water
part
ii
revelation
he
resolves
to
become
intelligible
at
least
to
himself
since
there
is
no
help
else
the
trial
by
existence
and
to
know
definitely
what
he
thinks
about
the
soul
in
equal
sacrifice
about
love
the
tuft
of
flowers
about
fellowship
spoils
of
the
dead
about
death
pan
with
us
about
art
his
own
the
demiurge
laugh
about
science
part
iii
now
close
the
windows
it
is
time
to
make
an
end
of
speaking
a
song
it
is
the
autumnal
mood
with
a
difference
october
he
sees
days
slipping
from
him
that
were
the
best
for
what
they
were
my
butterfly
there
are
things
that
can
never
be
the
same
reluctance
into
my
own
one
of
my
wishes
is
that
those
dark
trees
so
old
and
firm
they
scarcely
show
the
breeze
were
not
as
the
merest
mask
of
gloom
but
stretched
away
unto
the
edge
of
doom
i
should
not
be
withheld
but
that
some
day
into
their
vastness
i
should
steal
away
fearless
of
ever
finding
open
land
or
highway
where
the
slow
wheel
pours
the
sand
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
turn
back
or
those
should
not
set
forth
upon
my
track
to
overtake
me
who
should
miss
me
here
and
long
to
know
if
still
i
held
them
dear
they
would
not
find
me
changed
from
him
they
knew
only
more
sure
of
all
i
thought
was
true
ghost
house
i
dwell
in
a
lonely
house
i
know
that
vanished
many
a
summer
ago
and
left
no
trace
but
the
cellar
walls
and
a
cellar
in
which
the
daylight
falls
and
the
wild
raspberries
grow
ruined
fences
the
shield
the
woods
come
back
to
the
mowing
field
the
orchard
tree
has
grown
one
copse
of
new
wood
and
old
where
the
woodpecker
chops
the
footpath
down
to
the
well
is
healed
i
dwell
with
a
strangely
aching
heart
in
that
vanished
abode
there
far
apart
on
that
disused
and
forgotten
road
that
has
no
now
for
the
toad
night
comes
the
black
bats
tumble
and
dart
the
whippoorwill
is
coming
to
shout
and
hush
and
cluck
and
flutter
about
i
hear
him
begin
far
enough
away
full
many
a
time
to
say
his
say
before
he
arrives
to
say
it
out
it
is
under
the
small
dim
summer
star
i
know
not
who
these
mute
folk
are
who
share
the
unlit
place
with
me
those
stones
out
under
the
tree
doubtless
bear
names
that
the
mosses
mar
they
are
tireless
folk
but
slow
and
sad
though
two
are
lass
and
lad
with
none
among
them
that
ever
sings
and
yet
in
view
of
how
many
things
as
sweet
companions
as
might
be
had
my
november
guest
my
sorrow
when
she
here
with
me
thinks
these
dark
days
of
autumn
rain
are
beautiful
as
days
can
be
she
loves
the
bare
the
withered
tree
she
walks
the
sodden
pasture
lane
her
pleasure
will
not
let
me
stay
she
talks
and
i
am
fain
to
list
she
glad
the
birds
are
gone
away
she
glad
her
simple
worsted
gray
is
silver
now
with
clinging
mist
the
desolate
deserted
trees
the
faded
earth
the
heavy
sky
the
beauties
she
so
truly
sees
she
thinks
i
have
no
eye
for
these
and
vexes
me
for
reason
why
not
yesterday
i
learned
to
know
the
love
of
bare
november
days
before
the
coming
of
the
snow
but
it
were
vain
to
tell
her
so
and
they
are
better
for
her
praise
love
and
a
question
a
stranger
came
to
the
door
at
eve
and
he
spoke
the
bridegroom
fair
he
bore
a
stick
in
his
hand
and
for
all
burden
care
he
asked
with
the
eyes
more
than
the
lips
for
a
shelter
for
the
night
and
he
turned
and
looked
at
the
road
afar
without
a
window
light
the
bridegroom
came
forth
into
the
porch
with
us
look
at
the
sky
and
question
what
of
the
night
to
be
stranger
you
and
i
the
woodbine
leaves
littered
the
yard
the
woodbine
berries
were
blue
autumn
yes
winter
was
in
the
wind
i
wish
i
knew
within
the
bride
in
the
dusk
alone
bent
over
the
open
fire
her
face
with
the
glowing
coal
and
the
thought
of
the
heart
desire
the
bridegroom
looked
at
the
weary
road
yet
saw
but
her
within
and
wished
her
heart
in
a
case
of
gold
and
pinned
with
a
silver
pin
the
bridegroom
thought
it
little
to
give
a
dole
of
bread
a
purse
a
heartfelt
prayer
for
the
poor
of
god
or
for
the
rich
a
curse
but
whether
or
not
a
man
was
asked
to
mar
the
love
of
two
by
harboring
woe
in
the
bridal
house
the
bridegroom
wished
he
knew
a
late
walk
when
i
go
up
through
the
mowing
field
the
headless
aftermath
like
thatch
with
the
heavy
dew
half
closes
the
garden
path
and
when
i
come
to
the
garden
ground
the
whir
of
sober
birds
up
from
the
tangle
of
withered
weeds
is
sadder
than
any
words
a
tree
beside
the
wall
stands
bare
but
a
leaf
that
lingered
brown
disturbed
i
doubt
not
by
my
thought
comes
softly
rattling
down
i
end
not
far
from
my
going
forth
by
picking
the
faded
blue
of
the
last
remaining
aster
flower
to
carry
again
to
you
stars
how
countlessly
they
congregate
our
tumultuous
snow
which
flows
in
shapes
as
tall
as
trees
when
wintry
winds
do
blow
as
if
with
keenness
for
our
fate
our
faltering
few
steps
on
to
white
rest
and
a
place
of
rest
invisible
at
dawn
and
yet
with
neither
love
nor
hate
those
stars
like
some
minerva
marble
eyes
without
the
gift
of
sight
storm
fear
when
the
wind
works
against
us
in
the
dark
and
pelts
with
snow
the
lowest
chamber
window
on
the
east
and
whispers
with
a
sort
of
stifled
bark
the
beast
out
come
out
it
costs
no
inward
struggle
not
to
go
ah
no
i
count
our
strength
two
and
a
child
those
of
us
not
asleep
subdued
to
mark
how
the
cold
creeps
as
the
fire
dies
at
length
how
drifts
are
piled
dooryard
and
road
ungraded
till
even
the
comforting
barn
grows
far
away
and
my
heart
owns
a
doubt
whether
is
in
us
to
arise
with
day
and
save
ourselves
unaided
wind
and
window
flower
lovers
forget
your
love
and
list
to
the
love
of
these
she
a
window
flower
and
he
a
winter
breeze
when
the
frosty
window
veil
was
melted
down
at
noon
and
the
cag√®d
yellow
bird
hung
over
her
in
tune
he
marked
her
through
the
pane
he
could
not
help
but
mark
and
only
passed
her
by
to
come
again
at
dark
he
was
a
winter
wind
concerned
with
ice
and
snow
dead
weeds
and
unmated
birds
and
little
of
love
could
know
but
he
sighed
upon
the
sill
he
gave
the
sash
a
shake
as
witness
all
within
who
lay
that
night
awake
perchance
he
half
prevailed
to
win
her
for
the
flight
from
the
firelit
and
warm
light
but
the
flower
leaned
aside
and
thought
of
naught
to
say
and
morning
found
the
breeze
a
hundred
miles
away
to
the
thawing
wind
audio
come
with
rain
o
loud
southwester
bring
the
singer
bring
the
nester
give
the
buried
flower
a
dream
make
the
settled
steam
find
the
brown
beneath
the
white
but
you
do
bathe
my
window
make
it
flow
melt
it
as
the
ices
go
melt
the
glass
and
leave
the
sticks
like
a
hermit
crucifix
burst
into
my
narrow
stall
swing
the
picture
on
the
wall
run
the
rattling
pages
scatter
poems
on
the
floor
turn
the
poet
out
of
door
a
prayer
in
spring
oh
give
us
pleasure
in
the
flowers
and
give
us
not
to
think
so
far
away
as
the
uncertain
harvest
keep
us
here
all
simply
in
the
springing
of
the
year
oh
give
us
pleasure
in
the
orchard
white
like
nothing
else
by
day
like
ghosts
by
night
and
make
us
happy
in
the
happy
bees
the
swarm
dilating
round
the
perfect
trees
and
make
us
happy
in
the
darting
bird
that
suddenly
above
the
bees
is
heard
the
meteor
that
thrusts
in
with
needle
bill
and
off
a
blossom
in
mid
air
stands
still
for
this
is
love
and
nothing
else
is
love
the
which
it
is
reserved
for
god
above
to
sanctify
to
what
far
ends
he
will
but
which
it
only
needs
that
we
fulfil
i
left
you
in
the
morning
and
in
the
morning
glow
you
walked
a
way
beside
me
to
make
me
sad
to
go
do
you
know
me
in
the
gloaming
gaunt
and
dusty
grey
with
roaming
are
you
dumb
because
you
know
me
not
or
dumb
because
you
know
all
for
me
and
not
a
question
for
the
faded
flowers
gay
that
could
take
me
from
beside
you
for
the
ages
of
a
day
they
are
yours
and
be
the
measure
of
their
worth
for
you
to
treasure
the
measure
of
the
little
while
that
i
been
long
away
rose
pogonias
a
saturated
meadow
and
a
circle
scarcely
wider
than
the
trees
around
were
tall
where
winds
were
quite
excluded
and
the
air
was
stifling
sweet
with
the
breath
of
many
flowers
a
temple
of
the
heat
there
we
bowed
us
in
the
burning
as
the
sun
right
worship
is
to
pick
where
none
could
miss
them
a
thousand
orchises
for
though
the
grass
was
scattered
yet
every
second
spear
seemed
tipped
with
wings
of
color
that
tinged
the
atmosphere
we
raised
a
simple
prayer
before
we
left
the
spot
that
in
the
general
mowing
that
place
might
be
forgot
or
if
not
all
so
favoured
obtain
such
grace
of
hours
that
none
should
mow
the
grass
there
while
so
confused
with
flowers
asking
for
roses
a
house
that
lacks
seemingly
mistress
and
master
with
doors
that
none
but
the
wind
ever
closes
its
floor
all
littered
with
glass
and
with
plaster
it
stands
in
a
garden
of
roses
i
pass
by
that
way
in
the
gloaming
with
mary
wonder
i
say
the
owner
of
those
is
no
one
you
know
she
answers
me
airy
one
we
must
ask
if
we
want
any
roses
so
we
must
join
hands
in
the
dew
coming
coldly
there
in
the
hush
of
the
wood
that
reposes
and
turn
and
go
up
to
the
open
door
boldly
and
knock
to
the
echoes
as
beggars
for
roses
are
you
within
there
mistress
is
mary
that
speaks
and
our
errand
discloses
are
you
within
there
bestir
you
bestir
you
is
summer
again
there
two
come
for
roses
word
with
you
that
of
the
singer
recalling
old
herrick
a
saying
that
every
maid
knows
is
a
flower
unplucked
is
but
left
to
the
falling
and
nothing
is
gained
by
not
gathering
roses
we
do
not
loosen
our
hands
intertwining
not
caring
so
very
much
what
she
supposes
there
when
she
comes
on
us
mistily
shining
and
grants
us
by
silence
the
boon
of
her
roses
waiting
afield
at
dusk
what
things
for
dream
there
are
when
moving
among
tall
haycocks
lightly
piled
i
enter
alone
upon
the
stubble
field
from
which
the
laborers
voices
late
have
died
and
in
the
antiphony
of
afterglow
and
rising
full
moon
sit
me
down
upon
the
full
moon
side
of
the
first
haycock
and
lose
myself
amid
so
many
alike
i
dream
upon
the
opposing
lights
of
the
hour
preventing
shadow
until
the
moon
prevail
i
dream
upon
the
peopling
heaven
each
circling
each
with
vague
unearthly
cry
or
plunging
headlong
with
fierce
twang
afar
and
on
the
bat
mute
antics
who
would
seem
dimly
to
have
made
out
my
secret
place
only
to
lose
it
when
he
pirouettes
and
seek
it
endlessly
with
purblind
haste
on
the
last
swallow
sweep
and
on
the
rasp
in
the
abyss
of
odor
and
rustle
at
my
back
that
silenced
by
my
advent
finds
once
more
after
an
interval
his
instrument
and
tries
once
twice
and
thrice
if
i
be
there
and
on
the
worn
book
of
song
i
brought
not
here
to
read
it
seems
but
hold
and
freshen
in
this
air
of
withering
sweetness
but
on
the
memory
of
one
absent
most
for
whom
these
lines
when
they
shall
greet
her
eye
in
a
vale
when
i
was
young
we
dwelt
in
a
vale
by
a
misty
fen
that
rang
all
night
and
thus
it
was
the
maidens
pale
i
knew
so
well
whose
garments
trail
across
the
reeds
to
a
window
light
the
fen
had
every
kind
of
bloom
and
for
every
kind
there
was
a
face
and
a
voice
that
has
sounded
in
my
room
across
the
sill
from
the
outer
gloom
each
came
singly
unto
her
place
but
all
came
every
night
with
the
mist
and
often
they
brought
so
much
to
say
of
things
of
moment
to
which
they
wist
one
so
lonely
was
fain
to
list
that
the
stars
were
almost
faded
away
before
the
last
went
heavy
with
dew
back
to
the
place
from
which
she
came
where
the
bird
was
before
it
flew
where
the
flower
was
before
it
grew
where
bird
and
flower
were
one
and
the
same
and
thus
it
is
i
know
so
well
why
the
flower
has
odor
the
bird
has
song
you
have
only
to
ask
me
and
i
can
tell
no
not
vainly
there
did
i
dwell
nor
vainly
listen
all
the
night
long
a
dream
pang
i
had
withdrawn
in
forest
and
my
song
was
swallowed
up
in
leaves
that
blew
alway
and
to
the
forest
edge
you
came
one
day
this
was
my
dream
and
looked
and
pondered
long
but
did
not
enter
though
the
wish
was
strong
you
shook
your
pensive
head
as
who
should
say
dare
not
too
far
in
his
footsteps
stray
he
must
seek
me
would
he
undo
the
wrong
not
far
but
near
i
stood
and
saw
it
all
behind
low
boughs
the
trees
let
down
outside
and
the
sweet
pang
it
cost
me
not
to
call
and
tell
you
that
i
saw
does
still
abide
but
is
not
true
that
thus
i
dwelt
aloof
for
the
wood
wakes
and
you
are
here
for
proof
in
neglect
they
leave
us
so
to
the
way
we
took
as
two
in
whom
they
were
proved
mistaken
that
we
sit
sometimes
in
the
wayside
nook
with
mischievous
vagrant
seraphic
look
and
try
if
we
can
not
feel
forsaken
the
vantage
point
if
tired
of
trees
i
seek
again
mankind
well
i
know
where
to
hie
me
in
the
dawn
to
a
slope
where
the
cattle
keep
the
lawn
there
amid
lolling
juniper
reclined
myself
unseen
i
see
in
white
defined
far
off
the
homes
of
men
and
farther
still
the
graves
of
men
on
an
opposing
hill
living
or
dead
whichever
are
to
mind
and
if
by
moon
i
have
too
much
of
these
i
have
but
to
turn
on
my
arm
and
lo
the
hillside
sets
my
face
aglow
my
breathing
shakes
the
bluet
like
a
breeze
i
smell
the
earth
i
smell
the
bruis√®d
plant
i
look
into
the
crater
of
the
ant
mowing
there
was
never
a
sound
beside
the
wood
but
one
and
that
was
my
long
scythe
whispering
to
the
ground
what
was
it
it
whispered
i
knew
not
well
myself
perhaps
it
was
something
about
the
heat
of
the
sun
something
perhaps
about
the
lack
of
sound
and
that
was
why
it
whispered
and
did
not
speak
it
was
no
dream
of
the
gift
of
idle
hours
or
easy
gold
at
the
hand
of
fay
or
elf
anything
more
than
the
truth
would
have
seemed
too
weak
to
the
earnest
love
that
laid
the
swale
in
rows
not
without
spikes
of
flowers
pale
orchises
and
scared
a
bright
green
snake
the
fact
is
the
sweetest
dream
that
labor
knows
my
long
scythe
whispered
and
left
the
hay
to
make
going
for
water
the
well
was
dry
beside
the
door
and
so
we
went
with
pail
and
can
across
the
fields
behind
the
house
to
seek
the
brook
if
still
it
ran
not
loth
to
have
excuse
to
go
because
the
autumn
eve
was
fair
though
chill
because
the
fields
were
ours
and
by
the
brook
our
woods
were
there
we
ran
as
if
to
meet
the
moon
that
slowly
dawned
behind
the
trees
the
barren
boughs
without
the
leaves
without
the
birds
without
the
breeze
but
once
within
the
wood
we
paused
like
gnomes
that
hid
us
from
the
moon
ready
to
run
to
hiding
new
with
laughter
when
she
found
us
soon
each
laid
on
other
a
staying
hand
to
listen
ere
we
dared
to
look
and
in
the
hush
we
joined
to
make
we
heard
we
knew
we
heard
the
brook
a
note
as
from
a
single
place
a
slender
tinkling
fall
that
made
now
drops
that
floated
on
the
pool
like
pearls
and
now
a
silver
blade
revelation
we
make
ourselves
a
place
apart
behind
light
words
that
tease
and
flout
but
oh
the
agitated
heart
till
someone
find
us
really
out
is
pity
if
the
case
require
or
so
we
say
that
in
the
end
we
speak
the
literal
to
inspire
the
understanding
of
a
friend
but
so
with
all
from
babes
that
play
at
to
god
afar
so
all
who
hide
too
well
away
must
speak
and
tell
us
where
they
are
the
trial
by
existence
even
the
bravest
that
are
slain
shall
not
dissemble
their
surprise
on
waking
to
find
valor
reign
even
as
on
earth
in
paradise
and
where
they
sought
without
the
sword
wide
fields
of
asphodel
to
find
that
the
utmost
reward
of
daring
should
be
still
to
dare
the
light
of
heaven
falls
whole
and
white
and
is
not
shattered
into
dyes
the
light
for
ever
is
morning
light
the
hills
are
verdured
the
angel
hosts
with
freshness
go
and
seek
with
laughter
what
to
brave
and
binding
all
is
the
hushed
snow
of
the
breaking
wave
and
from
a
is
proclaimed
the
gathering
of
the
souls
for
birth
the
trial
by
existence
named
the
obscuration
upon
earth
and
the
slant
spirits
trooping
by
in
streams
and
and
can
but
give
ear
to
that
sweet
cry
for
its
suggestion
of
what
dreams
and
the
more
loitering
are
turned
to
view
once
more
the
sacrifice
of
those
who
for
some
good
discerned
will
gladly
give
up
paradise
and
a
white
shimmering
concourse
rolls
toward
the
throne
to
witness
there
the
speeding
of
devoted
souls
which
god
makes
his
especial
care
and
none
are
taken
but
who
will
having
first
heard
the
life
read
out
that
opens
earthward
good
and
ill
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
and
very
beautifully
god
limns
and
tenderly
life
little
dream
but
naught
extenuates
or
dims
setting
the
thing
that
is
supreme
nor
is
there
wanting
in
the
press
some
spirit
to
stand
simply
forth
heroic
in
its
nakedness
against
the
uttermost
of
earth
the
tale
of
earth
unhonored
things
sounds
nobler
there
than
the
sun
and
the
mind
whirls
and
the
heart
sings
and
a
shout
greets
the
daring
one
but
always
god
speaks
at
the
end
thought
in
agony
of
strife
the
bravest
would
have
by
for
friend
the
memory
that
he
chose
the
life
but
the
pure
fate
to
which
you
go
admits
no
memory
of
choice
or
the
woe
were
not
earthly
woe
to
which
you
give
the
assenting
voice
and
so
the
choice
must
be
again
but
the
last
choice
is
still
the
same
and
the
awe
passes
wonder
then
and
a
hush
falls
for
all
acclaim
and
god
has
taken
a
flower
of
gold
and
broken
it
and
used
therefrom
the
mystic
link
to
bind
and
hold
spirit
to
matter
till
death
come
is
of
the
essence
of
life
here
though
we
choose
greatly
still
to
lack
the
lasting
memory
at
all
clear
that
life
has
for
us
on
the
wrack
nothing
but
what
we
somehow
chose
thus
are
we
wholly
stripped
of
pride
in
the
pain
that
has
but
one
close
bearing
it
crushed
and
mystified
in
equal
sacrifice
thus
of
old
the
douglas
did
he
left
his
land
as
he
was
bid
with
the
royal
heart
of
robert
the
bruce
in
a
golden
case
with
a
golden
lid
to
carry
the
same
to
the
holy
land
by
which
we
see
and
understand
that
that
was
the
place
to
carry
a
heart
at
loyalty
and
love
command
and
that
was
the
case
to
carry
it
in
the
douglas
had
not
far
to
win
before
he
came
to
the
land
of
spain
where
long
a
holy
war
had
been
against
the
moor
and
there
his
courage
could
not
endure
not
to
strike
a
blow
for
god
before
he
made
his
errand
sure
and
ever
it
was
intended
so
that
a
man
for
god
should
strike
a
blow
no
matter
the
heart
he
has
in
charge
for
the
holy
land
where
hearts
should
go
but
when
in
battle
the
foe
were
met
the
douglas
found
him
sore
beset
with
only
strength
of
the
fighting
arm
for
one
more
battle
passage
yet
and
that
as
vain
to
save
the
day
as
bring
his
body
safe
away
only
a
signal
deed
to
do
and
a
last
sounding
word
to
say
the
heart
he
wore
in
a
golden
chain
he
swung
and
flung
forth
into
the
plain
and
followed
it
crying
or
death
and
fighting
over
it
perished
fain
so
may
another
do
of
right
give
a
heart
to
the
hopeless
fight
the
more
of
right
the
more
he
loves
so
may
another
redouble
might
for
a
few
swift
gleams
of
the
angry
brand
scorning
greatly
not
to
demand
in
equal
sacrifice
with
his
the
heart
he
bore
to
the
holy
land
the
tuft
of
flowers
i
went
to
turn
the
grass
once
after
one
who
mowed
it
in
the
dew
before
the
sun
the
dew
was
gone
that
made
his
blade
so
keen
before
i
came
to
view
the
leveled
scene
i
looked
for
him
behind
an
isle
of
trees
i
listened
for
his
whetstone
on
the
breeze
but
he
had
gone
his
way
the
grass
all
mown
and
i
must
be
as
he
had
been
alone
all
must
be
i
said
within
my
heart
they
work
together
or
apart
but
as
i
said
it
swift
there
passed
me
by
on
noiseless
wing
a
butterfly
seeking
with
memories
grown
dim
night
some
resting
flower
of
yesterday
delight
and
once
i
marked
his
flight
go
round
and
round
as
where
some
flower
lay
withering
on
the
ground
and
then
he
flew
as
far
as
eye
could
see
and
then
on
tremulous
wing
came
back
to
me
i
thought
of
questions
that
have
no
reply
and
would
have
turned
to
toss
the
grass
to
dry
but
he
turned
first
and
led
my
eye
to
look
at
a
tall
tuft
of
flowers
beside
a
brook
a
leaping
tongue
of
bloom
the
scythe
had
spared
beside
a
reedy
brook
the
scythe
had
bared
i
left
my
place
to
know
them
by
their
name
finding
them
butterfly
weed
when
i
came
the
mower
in
the
dew
had
loved
them
thus
by
leaving
them
to
flourish
not
for
us
nor
yet
to
draw
one
thought
of
ours
to
him
but
from
sheer
morning
gladness
at
the
brim
the
butterfly
and
i
had
lit
upon
nevertheless
a
message
from
the
dawn
that
made
me
hear
the
wakening
birds
around
and
hear
his
long
scythe
whispering
to
the
ground
and
feel
a
spirit
kindred
to
my
own
so
that
henceforth
i
worked
no
more
alone
but
glad
with
him
i
worked
as
with
his
aid
and
weary
sought
at
noon
with
him
the
shade
and
dreaming
as
it
were
held
brotherly
speech
with
one
whose
thought
i
had
not
hoped
to
reach
work
together
i
told
him
from
the
heart
they
work
together
or
apart
spoils
of
the
dead
two
fairies
it
was
on
a
still
summer
day
came
forth
in
the
woods
with
the
flowers
to
play
the
flowers
they
plucked
they
cast
on
the
ground
for
others
and
those
for
still
others
they
found
it
was
that
they
came
as
they
ran
on
something
that
lay
in
the
shape
of
a
man
the
snow
must
have
made
the
feathery
bed
when
this
one
fell
on
the
sleep
of
the
dead
but
the
snow
was
gone
a
long
time
ago
and
the
body
he
wore
nigh
gone
with
the
snow
the
fairies
drew
near
and
keenly
espied
a
ring
on
his
hand
and
a
chain
at
his
side
they
knelt
in
the
leaves
and
eerily
played
with
the
glittering
things
and
were
not
afraid
and
when
they
went
home
to
hide
in
their
burrow
they
took
them
along
to
play
with
when
you
came
on
death
did
you
not
come
like
the
elves
in
the
wood
i
remember
that
i
did
but
i
recognised
death
with
sorrow
and
dread
and
i
hated
and
hate
the
spoils
of
the
dead
pan
with
us
pan
came
out
of
the
woods
one
day
his
skin
and
his
hair
and
his
eyes
were
gray
the
gray
of
the
moss
of
walls
were
they
and
stood
in
the
sun
and
looked
his
fill
at
wooded
valley
and
wooded
hill
he
stood
in
the
zephyr
pipes
in
hand
on
a
height
of
naked
pasture
land
in
all
the
country
he
did
command
he
saw
no
smoke
and
he
saw
no
roof
that
was
well
and
he
stamped
a
hoof
his
heart
knew
peace
for
none
came
here
to
this
lean
feeding
save
once
a
year
someone
to
salt
the
steer
or
homespun
children
with
clicking
pails
who
see
no
little
they
tell
no
tales
he
tossed
his
pipes
too
hard
to
teach
a
song
far
out
of
reach
for
a
sylvan
sign
that
the
blue
jay
screech
and
the
whimper
of
hawks
beside
the
sun
were
music
enough
for
him
for
one
times
were
changed
from
what
they
were
such
pipes
kept
less
of
power
to
stir
the
fruited
bough
of
the
juniper
and
the
fragile
bluets
clustered
there
than
the
merest
aimless
breath
of
air
they
were
pipes
of
pagan
mirth
and
the
world
had
found
new
terms
of
worth
he
laid
him
down
on
the
earth
and
ravelled
a
flower
and
looked
away
play
play
what
should
he
play
the
demiurge
laugh
it
was
far
in
the
sameness
of
the
wood
i
was
running
with
joy
on
the
demon
trail
though
i
knew
what
i
hunted
was
no
true
god
it
was
just
as
the
light
was
beginning
to
fail
that
i
suddenly
heard
all
i
needed
to
hear
it
has
lasted
me
many
and
many
a
year
the
sound
was
behind
me
instead
of
before
a
sleepy
sound
but
mocking
half
as
of
one
who
utterly
could
care
the
demon
arose
from
his
wallow
to
laugh
brushing
the
dirt
from
his
eye
as
he
went
and
well
i
knew
what
the
demon
meant
i
shall
not
forget
how
his
laugh
rang
out
i
felt
as
a
fool
to
have
been
so
caught
and
checked
my
steps
to
make
pretence
it
was
something
among
the
leaves
i
sought
though
doubtful
whether
he
stayed
to
see
thereafter
i
sat
me
against
a
tree
now
close
the
windows
now
close
the
windows
and
hush
all
the
fields
if
the
trees
must
let
them
silently
toss
no
bird
is
singing
now
and
if
there
is
be
it
my
loss
it
will
be
long
ere
the
marshes
resume
it
will
be
long
ere
the
earliest
bird
so
close
the
windows
and
not
hear
the
wind
but
see
all
a
song
the
clouds
fly
tattered
and
swift
the
road
is
forlorn
all
day
where
a
myriad
snowy
quartz
stones
lift
and
the
vanish
away
the
roadside
flowers
too
wet
for
the
bee
expend
their
bloom
in
vain
come
over
the
hills
and
far
with
me
and
be
my
love
in
the
rain
the
birds
have
less
to
say
for
themselves
in
the
torn
despair
than
now
these
numberless
years
the
elves
although
they
are
no
less
there
all
song
of
the
woods
is
crushed
like
some
wild
easily
shattered
rose
come
be
my
love
in
the
wet
woods
come
where
the
boughs
rain
when
it
blows
there
is
the
gale
to
urge
behind
and
bruit
our
singing
down
and
the
shallow
waters
aflutter
with
wind
from
which
to
gather
your
gown
what
matter
if
we
go
clear
to
the
west
and
come
not
through
for
wilding
brooch
shall
wet
your
breast
the
goldenrod
oh
never
this
whelming
east
wind
swells
but
it
seems
like
the
sea
return
to
the
ancient
lands
where
it
left
the
shells
before
the
age
of
the
fern
and
it
seems
like
the
time
when
after
doubt
our
love
came
back
amain
oh
come
forth
into
the
storm
and
rout
and
be
my
love
in
the
rain
october
o
hushed
october
morning
mild
thy
leaves
have
ripened
to
the
fall
wind
if
it
be
wild
should
waste
them
all
the
crows
above
the
forest
call
they
may
form
and
go
o
hushed
october
morning
mild
begin
the
hours
of
this
day
slow
make
the
day
seem
to
us
less
brief
hearts
not
averse
to
being
beguiled
beguile
us
in
the
way
you
know
release
one
leaf
at
break
of
day
at
noon
release
another
leaf
one
from
our
trees
one
far
away
retard
the
sun
with
gentle
mist
enchant
the
land
with
amethyst
slow
slow
for
the
grapes
sake
if
they
were
all
whose
leaves
already
are
burnt
with
frost
whose
clustered
fruit
must
else
be
lost
for
the
grapes
sake
along
the
wall
my
butterfly
thine
emulous
fond
flowers
are
dead
too
and
the
daft
he
that
frighted
thee
so
oft
is
fled
or
dead
save
only
me
nor
is
it
sad
to
thee
save
only
me
there
is
none
left
to
mourn
thee
in
the
fields
the
gray
grass
is
not
dappled
with
the
snow
its
two
banks
have
not
shut
upon
the
river
but
it
is
long
ago
it
seems
forever
since
first
i
saw
thee
glance
with
all
the
dazzling
other
ones
in
airy
dalliance
precipitate
in
love
tossed
tangled
whirled
and
whirled
above
like
a
limp
in
a
fairy
dance
when
that
was
the
soft
mist
of
my
regret
hung
not
on
all
the
land
and
i
was
glad
for
thee
and
glad
for
me
i
wist
thou
didst
not
know
who
tottered
wandering
on
high
that
fate
had
made
thee
for
the
pleasure
of
the
wind
with
those
great
careless
wings
nor
yet
did
i
and
there
were
other
things
it
seemed
god
let
thee
flutter
from
his
gentle
clasp
then
fearful
he
had
let
thee
win
too
far
beyond
him
to
be
gathered
in
snatched
thee
eager
with
ungentle
grasp
ah
i
remember
me
how
once
conspiracy
was
rife
against
my
life
the
languor
of
it
and
the
dreaming
fond
surging
the
grasses
dizzied
me
of
thought
the
breeze
three
odors
brought
and
a
waved
in
a
wand
then
when
i
was
distraught
and
could
not
speak
sidelong
full
on
my
cheek
what
should
that
reckless
zephyr
fling
but
the
wild
touch
of
thy
wing
i
found
that
wing
broken
for
thou
are
dead
i
said
and
the
strange
birds
say
i
found
it
with
the
withered
leaves
under
the
eaves
reluctance
out
through
the
fields
and
the
woods
and
over
the
walls
i
have
wended
i
have
climbed
the
hills
of
view
and
looked
at
the
world
and
descended
i
have
come
by
the
highway
home
and
lo
it
is
ended
the
leaves
are
all
dead
on
the
ground
save
those
that
the
oak
is
keeping
to
ravel
them
one
by
one
and
let
them
go
scraping
and
creeping
out
over
the
crusted
snow
when
others
are
sleeping
and
the
dead
leaves
lie
huddled
and
still
no
longer
blown
hither
and
thither
the
last
lone
aster
is
gone
the
flowers
of
the
wither
the
heart
is
still
aching
to
seek
but
the
feet
question
ah
when
to
the
heart
of
man
was
it
ever
less
than
a
treason
to
go
with
the
drift
of
things
to
yield
with
a
grace
to
reason
and
bow
and
accept
and
accept
the
end
of
a
love
or
a
season
