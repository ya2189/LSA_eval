the
cornflower
the
day
she
came
we
were
planting
corn
the
west
field
these
prairie
farms
are
great
for
size
and
they
sometimes
great
for
yield
the
new
is
up
to
the
house
the
called
out
to
me
i
went
in
wishing
anyone
else
had
been
put
in
chief
trustee
i
was
to
question
that
girl
you
see
of
the
things
she
ought
to
know
as
for
these
same
things
i
knew
right
well
i
forgot
them
long
ago
i
had
kept
track
of
women
ways
all
i
knew
of
the
sex
was
that
they
were
mighty
hard
to
please
and
easy
enough
to
vex
my
sister
mary
who
ruled
my
house
and
me
with
an
iron
hand
was
all
the
woman
i
knew
real
well
her
i
did
understand
but
i
no
call
to
grumble
at
fate
fifty
well
off
and
unwed
young
as
a
lad
in
spite
of
the
dust
old
time
had
thrown
on
my
head
i
engaged
the
on
the
spot
and
the
reason
i
surmise
was
this
she
did
giggle
or
blush
but
looked
me
fair
in
the
eyes
the
planting
over
why
every
lad
in
a
space
of
ten
good
mile
was
off
for
the
school
with
a
sudden
zeal
that
made
all
us
old
folks
smile
how
she
took
to
our
wide
prairie
after
towns
with
narrow
streets
to
watch
that
west
field
was
one
of
her
queer
conceits
you
planted
that
corn
the
day
i
came
she
said
and
i
love
to
go
and
watch
the
kiss
and
coax
each
slim
green
stalk
to
grow
i
called
her
cornflower
when
she
took
to
wearing
in
her
belt
the
young
chaps
were
all
in
love
with
her
i
knew
just
how
they
oh
i
tell
you
that
was
a
summer
such
sunshine
such
dew
such
rain
never
saw
crops
grow
so
in
my
life
do
expect
i
will
again
to
watch
that
west
field
when
the
fall
came
clear
and
cold
was
something
like
a
sermon
to
me
made
me
think
of
streets
of
gold
but
about
that
time
the
new
had
words
with
the
first
trustee
a
scholar
had
taken
the
fever
and
she
was
for
blaming
that
schoolhouse
should
be
raised
from
the
ground
grave
reason
there
for
alarm
a
new
coat
of
plaster
be
put
on
that
the
children
be
kept
warm
a
well
a
good
one
should
take
the
place
of
the
deathtrap
that
was
there
this
should
all
be
done
at
once
she
said
cost
five
hundred
dollars
clear
i
told
her
i
could
think
of
it
but
when
all
my
work
was
through
if
the
taxes
came
in
middling
good
i
would
see
what
i
could
do
remember
you
only
the
steward
she
said
of
your
acres
broad
and
that
the
cry
of
a
little
child
goes
straight
to
the
ears
of
god
i
remarked
that
it
was
her
place
to
dictate
to
the
trustee
and
cornflower
lifted
her
eyes
of
blue
and
what
she
thought
of
me
that
night
as
we
came
up
from
the
fields
and
talked
of
the
threatened
frost
the
called
out
half
pleased
half
scared
the
got
herself
lost
i
turned
me
about
and
spoke
no
word
i
find
her
and
let
her
see
i
held
no
spite
a
wayward
girl
for
lecturing
a
trustee
for
i
knew
before
i
found
the
knot
of
ribbon
that
she
had
worn
that
somehow
betty
had
lost
her
way
in
the
forest
of
ripened
corn
the
sun
went
down
and
left
the
world
beautiful
happy
and
good
true
the
girl
and
myself
had
quarrelled
but
when
i
found
her
and
stood
with
silver
stars
mistily
shining
through
the
deep
blue
of
the
skies
heard
somebody
sob
like
a
baby
saw
tears
in
somebody
eyes
why
i
just
whispered
betty
betty
then
whispered
betty
some
more
not
another
word
did
i
utter
i
stick
to
this
and
you
need
ask
me
to
explain
friends
i
do
know
how
was
myself
that
first
betty
said
i
was
ashamed
of
my
greedy
love
of
pelf
the
second
one
told
her
i
be
glad
to
raise
the
old
schoolhouse
up
and
be
in
haste
to
put
down
a
well
with
a
pump
and
drinking
cup
the
third
betty
told
her
i
would
act
a
higher
and
nobler
part
the
fourth
betty
told
her
i
loved
her
loved
her
with
all
my
heart
ah
well
there
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
was
what
sister
mary
said
no
fool
in
the
world
like
an
old
fool
you
find
that
out
brother
ned
mary
i
said
there
a
better
thing
than
land
or
dollar
or
dime
if
being
in
love
is
being
a
fool
here
one
till
the
end
of
time
i
should
think
so
i
a
married
man
four
years
come
this
christmastide
and
autumn
now
is
flinging
her
gold
the
fields
on
every
side
my
wife
called
out
as
i
drove
the
cows
to
the
this
morn
ned
please
go
look
for
your
son
and
heir
he
toddled
off
in
the
corn
and
sister
mary
must
make
a
joke
go
find
him
at
once
said
she
you
know
to
get
lost
in
a
field
of
corn
runs
in
that
boy
family
the
quarrel
when
mary
found
fault
with
me
that
day
the
trouble
was
well
begun
no
man
likes
being
found
fault
with
no
man
really
thinks
it
fun
to
have
a
wisp
of
a
woman
in
a
most
obnoxious
way
allude
to
his
temper
as
beastly
and
remark
that
day
by
day
he
proves
himself
so
careless
so
lacking
in
love
so
mean
then
add
with
an
air
convincing
she
wishes
she
never
seen
a
person
who
thinks
so
little
of
breaking
a
woman
heart
and
since
he
is
well
what
he
is
is
better
that
they
should
part
now
no
man
enjoys
this
performance
he
has
his
faults
well
and
good
he
does
want
to
hear
them
named
this
ought
to
be
understood
mary
was
aggravating
and
all
because
i
forgot
to
bring
some
flowers
i
promised
as
though
it
mattered
a
lot
but
that
the
way
with
a
woman
your
big
sins
she
may
forgive
but
little
things
not
worth
mention
you
hear
of
as
long
as
you
live
a
few
sweet
peas
and
carnations
to
start
a
tempest
forsooth
for
mary
got
in
a
temper
i
did
the
same
of
a
truth
i
said
things
that
were
gentle
she
pretended
not
to
mind
but
answered
back
in
a
manner
that
left
me
away
behind
it
ended
up
in
our
saying
for
the
rest
of
our
days
both
vowing
we
be
happier
going
our
different
ways
and
i
strode
out
in
the
garden
where
the
trees
were
pink
and
white
where
bobolinks
scolded
sparrows
and
robins
wild
with
delight
chirped
and
called
and
fluttered
in
the
blossoming
trees
above
where
nature
was
busy
teaching
her
lessons
of
joy
and
love
i
made
a
bed
of
the
soft
warm
earth
stretched
me
out
in
the
sun
vext
and
weary
i
fell
asleep
and
slept
till
the
day
was
done
the
voice
of
my
brother
waked
me
crying
quickly
arise
and
come
bear
up
like
a
man
heaven
help
you
death
has
suddenly
entered
your
home
was
mary
my
own
sweet
mary
the
eyelashes
slept
on
her
cheek
the
lips
had
a
on
them
as
though
they
were
going
to
speak
some
of
the
tender
words
witty
rejoinder
or
jest
or
ask
the
question
they
asked
so
oft
jim
who
do
you
love
the
best
but
the
small
hands
gave
no
pressure
when
i
took
them
in
my
own
and
bending
down
to
kiss
her
face
i
found
it
cold
as
a
stone
and
it
came
to
me
i
could
never
never
since
mary
was
dead
say
dear
one
i
did
mean
them
the
bitter
words
that
i
said
never
see
the
tears
go
from
her
sweet
dark
eyes
and
the
brightness
take
their
place
never
watch
the
joy
and
gladness
come
back
to
my
darling
face
not
a
fault
could
i
remember
she
been
perfect
all
her
days
with
her
sweetness
and
her
laughter
her
tender
womanly
ways
dead
dead
in
her
fresh
young
beauty
oh
i
had
an
anguished
heart
at
thought
of
the
quarrel
ending
in
our
agreeing
to
part
when
two
people
love
each
other
i
tell
you
the
wisest
way
is
to
think
before
speaking
harshly
for
there
surely
will
come
a
day
when
one
will
sleep
on
so
soundly
that
he
or
she
will
not
wake
the
other
sit
in
the
stillness
and
cry
with
a
great
it
is
to
ears
all
unheeding
our
tenderest
words
are
said
the
love
that
the
living
long
for
we
waste
it
upon
the
dead
we
say
this
life
is
so
dreary
talk
much
of
heaven
i
know
but
if
we
were
good
to
each
other
we
have
our
heaven
below
mary
i
whispered
my
mary
no
flowers
to
you
i
gave
but
i
heap
them
on
your
coffin
and
plant
them
over
your
grave
a
bird
sang
sweetly
and
shrilly
in
the
blossoms
and
i
awoke
awoke
awoke
i
that
mary
was
dead
i
woke
in
the
golden
sunshine
the
birds
were
singing
aloud
there
was
no
still
form
beside
me
nor
any
coffin
or
shroud
but
just
a
slip
of
a
woman
with
her
brown
eyes
full
of
tears
oh
that
blessed
blessed
waking
i
remembered
through
all
the
years
i
told
the
story
to
mary
who
has
let
me
forget
that
dream
in
the
blossoming
orchard
i
hear
of
it
often
yet
if
i
neglect
to
bring
flowers
it
oh
you
going
to
save
your
roses
to
heap
on
my
coffin
your
pansies
to
plant
on
my
grave
and
if
i
lose
my
temper
a
common
weakness
of
men
the
sweetest
voice
in
the
world
says
you
have
to
get
dreaming
again
in
sunflower
time
in
the
farmhouse
kitchen
were
nan
and
john
with
only
the
sunflowers
looking
on
a
farmhouse
kitchen
is
scarce
the
place
for
knight
or
lady
of
courtly
grace
but
this
is
just
an
everyday
pair
that
hold
the
kitchen
this
morning
fair
a
saucy
persistent
limb
had
sacrificed
a
part
of
the
brim
of
the
youth
straw
hat
his
face
was
brown
and
his
forehead
wore
a
frown
his
boots
were
splashed
with
mud
and
clay
from
marshland
pasture
over
the
way
where
alderbushes
and
spicewood
grew
and
frogs
croaked
noisily
all
night
through
muslin
curtains
snowy
and
thin
the
homely
sunflowers
nodded
in
nan
was
a
picture
her
muslin
gown
had
maybe
a
bit
grown
but
fitted
the
slender
shape
so
well
in
its
neck
the
soft
lace
fell
sleeves
it
had
none
from
the
elbows
down
in
length
well
you
see
the
maid
had
grown
a
labor
of
love
her
homely
task
to
share
it
none
need
hope
nor
ask
for
nan
was
washing
each
trace
of
dirt
from
fluted
bodice
and
ruffled
skirt
now
few
that
will
and
fewer
that
can
bend
over
a
tub
like
pretty
nan
the
frail
soap
bubbles
sailed
high
in
air
as
she
drew
each
piece
from
frothy
lair
and
rubbed
with
cruel
yet
tender
hand
as
only
a
woman
could
understand
then
wrung
with
twist
of
the
wrist
so
strong
examined
with
care
shook
well
and
long
flung
in
clear
water
to
lie
in
state
each
dainty
piece
met
the
same
hard
fate
is
done
with
a
look
of
conscious
pride
at
the
rinsing
bucket
deep
and
wide
wiping
the
suds
from
each
rounded
arm
she
turned
to
john
with
a
smile
so
warm
i
kept
you
waiting
excuse
me
please
the
soapsuds
ruin
such
goods
as
these
you
over
fond
of
finery
nan
dresses
and
furbelows
he
began
maybe
i
am
of
a
truth
she
said
each
sunflower
nodded
its
yellow
head
ned
brown
growing
rich
john
words
came
slow
that
he
loves
you
well
you
doubtless
know
my
house
and
acres
i
held
them
fast
was
stubborn
over
them
to
the
last
for
when
my
father
was
carried
forth
and
men
were
asking
was
he
worth
i
saw
them
look
and
nod
and
smile
as
they
whispered
together
all
the
while
fine
old
homestead
but
mortgaged
so
a
foolish
thing
for
a
man
to
do
i
said
father
dead
and
gone
but
he
left
behind
a
son
my
heart
was
hot
with
a
purpose
set
to
clear
that
mortgage
to
pay
that
debt
i
worked
heaven
knows
like
any
slave
i
learned
the
lesson
of
scrimp
and
save
kept
a
good
horse
but
dressed
like
a
clown
and
i
not
a
dollar
to
call
my
own
i
beaten
well
beaten
yesterday
everything
went
to
ned
brown
from
me
my
woods
my
meadows
my
tasseled
corn
the
orchard
planted
when
i
was
born
the
old
rose
garden
my
mother
loved
my
chestnut
mare
ca
help
feeling
moved
for
i
a
beggar
nan
you
see
do
think
me
begging
for
sympathy
the
world
is
wide
i
do
care
much
thank
god
health
a
thing
the
law
ca
touch
the
happiest
man
i
ever
knew
was
born
a
beggar
and
died
one
too
each
sunflower
nodding
its
yellow
head
listened
to
every
word
that
was
said
as
nan
in
her
slow
and
easy
way
in
the
farmhouse
kitchen
that
summer
day
set
a
great
and
weighty
problem
forth
one
that
no
scholar
on
this
green
earth
has
been
able
to
solve
since
things
began
with
adam
a
lone
and
lonesome
man
yet
very
coolly
she
set
it
forth
tell
me
the
truth
how
much
am
worth
the
sunbeams
kissing
her
golden
hair
her
cheeks
her
round
arms
dimpled
and
bare
seemed
stamping
value
of
mighty
wealth
on
youth
and
love
and
the
bloom
of
health
john
looked
and
looked
till
his
eyes
grew
dim
then
tilted
the
hat
with
worthless
brim
to
hide
what
he
would
not
have
her
see
you
are
worth
the
whole
world
nan
said
he
then
you
no
beggar
said
sweet
bold
nan
you
the
whole
world
richer
than
any
man
a
girl
queen
wearing
a
crown
of
gold
set
a
precedent
the
tale
is
told
but
no
royal
prince
this
world
has
seen
ever
felt
so
proud
as
john
i
ween
as
he
clasped
her
hands
in
hope
and
never
noticed
they
smelt
of
soap
only
the
sunflowers
looking
on
so
he
kissed
the
maid
oh
foolish
john
as
he
went
out
through
the
garden
gate
ned
brown
was
coming
to
learn
his
fate
he
was
riding
john
own
chestnut
mare
but
somehow
john
did
seem
to
care
the
two
men
met
at
top
of
the
hill
and
eyed
each
other
as
rivals
will
ned
thought
of
the
home
he
won
from
john
poor
beggar
he
said
as
he
rode
on
john
thought
of
all
he
had
won
from
ned
you
poor
poor
beggar
was
what
he
said
why
under
the
heavens
clear
and
blue
only
our
john
and
the
sunflowers
knew
the
wooing
o
katie
mcleod
of

his
son
to
him
mcleod
of
dare
looked
stern
and
grim
for
he
was
sending
on
mission
grave
his
son
and
though
he
knew
him
brave
the
old
man
trembled
lest
he
should
make
in
heedless
youth
a
grave
mistake
was
not
for
the
country
nor
for
the
king
nay
was
a
more
important
thing
than
country
or
clan
or
feud
or
strife
the
young
man
went
to
woo
a
wife
he
listened
did
neil
with
scanty
grace
haughty
gloom
on
his
handsome
face
while
the
old
man
told
him
where
to
go
and
what
to
say
and
what
to
do

listened
closest
to
what
was
said
of
kate
the
poor
but
pretty
maid
and
when
he
reached
his
good
uncle
place
was
kate
that
in
his
eyes
found
grace
the
while
jane
simpered
with
conscious
pride
as
if
to
say
behold
your
bride
in
this
home
he
dwelt
for
many
a
day
a
favorite
he
of
donald
gray
they
walked
together
over
the
hill
or
through
the
valleys
solemn
and
still
and
the
old
man
showed
him
acres
wide
that
would
be
jane
dower
as
a
bride
then
spoke
of
the
cousin
poor
but
fair
her
eyes
of
blue
and
her
golden
hair
she
hae
na
flocks
and
she
hae
na

na

stood
in
her
scanty
dress
would
man
o
mettle
luve
her
less
the
lad
heart
warmed
to
the
logic
old
what
worth
has
land
what
worth
has
gold
compared
with
the
light
in
katie
eyes
what
worth
was
aught
beneath
the
skies
jane
courted
briskly
day
by
day
if
he
walked
out
she
walked
his
way
did
he
sit
him
down
to
rest
awhile
she
looked
his
way
with
tender
smile
did
he
try
to
get
a
word
with
kate
jane
was
there
like
the
hand
of
fate
one
day
it
chanced
as
he
rode
to
mill
he
met
with
kate
just
under
the
hill
would
she
mount
beside
him
ride
along
yes
if
he
felt
not
be
wrong
he
helped
her
up
with
a
trembling
arm
surely
the
day
is
close
and
warm
whoa
mare
steady
there
no
need
for
haste
with
two
soft
arms
about
his
waist
neil
shame
on
him
pressed
kate
then
turned
about
and
pressed
her
lips
all
over
the
road
the
blossoms
white
scattered
themselves
in
sheer
delight
a
bird
flew
singing
a
tender
rhyme
of
meadow
mate
and
nesting
time
the
world
looked
beautiful
in
the
glow
that
heaven
flung
on
the
hills
below
ah
me
if
that
ride
could
but
last
a
week
her
gold
hair
blowing
against
his
cheek
the
road
to
the
mill
says
worldly
wise
nay
nay
the
road
to
paradise

once
if
you
wish
to
know
something
of
heaven
here
below

eyes
grow
dim
and

this
journey
quite
but
neil

go
to
the
old
home
place
meet
his
stern
father
face
to
face
altho
his
cheek
was
a
trifle
pale
boldly
enough
he
told
his
tale
he
would
marry
kate
and
kate
alone
he
could
not
love
the
other
one
her
eyes
were
crooked
her
hair
was
red
freckles
over
her
face
were
spread
and
the
whole
world
held
no
lass
for
him
but

the
old
man
grim

eager
eyes
of
gray

not
for
the
land
not
for
the
gold
not
for
the
flocks
that
slept
in
fold
not
for
the
wealth
the
worldly
gear
but
something
wonderful
sweet
and
dear
thank
heaven
he
cried
with
a
glow
and
thrill
thank
heaven
for
the
day
i
rode
to
mill
the
old
man
visit
joe
lives
on
the
farm
and
sam
lives
in
the
city
i
have
a
daughter
at
all
more
the
pity
for
girls
to
my
mind
are
much
nicer
and
neater
not
such
workers
as
boys
but
cuter
and
sweeter
sam
has
prospered
in
town
has
riches
big
house
fine
library
books
written
by
henty
and
kipling
and
cooper
and
all
those
big
writers
swell
pictures
and
busts
of
great
heroes
and
fighters
his
home
is
a
fine
one
from
cellar
to
garret
but
not
to
my
notion
in
fact
i
ca
bear
it
i
not
hard
to
please
but
of
all
things
provoking
is
a
woman
around
who
sniffs
when
you
smoking
last
springtime
sam
said
now
father
how
is
it
i
ca
coax
you
oftener
up
on
a
visit
i
could
think
up
any
plausible
reason
so
off
i
went
with
him
to
stop
for
a
season
sam
said
with
a
laugh
as
we
stepped
from
the
ferry
you
wo
mind
my
wife
she
particular
very
it
was
like
home
that
house
in
the
city
our
sam
took
his
fun
at
the
club
more
the
pity
it
is
in
his
own
house
when
he
has
the
leisure
a
man
should
find
comfort
and
freedom
and
pleasure
it
was
so
bad
for
me
in
the
daytime
sam
took
me
all
over
and
made
it
a
playtime
but
evenings
were
awful
we
sat
there
so
proper
while
sam
wife
if
nobody
came
in
to
stop
her
read
history
to
us
or
column
by
column
a
housekeeping
journal
or
other
dry
volume
i
used
to
wish
someone
would
give
me
a
prodding
my
eyes
would
go
shut
and
head
fall
she
an
awful
good
housewife
nothing
gets
musty
or
littered
about
or
untidy
or
dusty
but
a
little
disorder
never
did
fret
me
and
these
perfect
women
they
always
upset
me
i
can
stand
her
dusting
her
shining
her
poking
but
wilt
like
a
leaf
when
she
sniffs
when
i
smoking
i
got
so
blamed
homesick
i
could
be
jolly
i
wanted
our
joe
and
his
little
wife
molly
my
old
corner
at
home
and
all
the
old
places
i
wanted
the
youngsters
who
cared
if
their
faces
were
smeared
up
a
trifle
i
did
a
penny
molly
tends
to
though
she
has
so
many
i
was
tickled
to
death
when
i
got
a
letter
from
joe
which
ran
dear
dad
i
think
you
had
better
get
back
to
the
farm
in
pretty
short
order
molly
papered
your
room
and
put
on
a
border
the
baby
she
says
has
two
new
teeth
to
show
you
if
you
do
hustle
back
the
dear
thing
wo
know
you
she
says
to
inform
you
that
bob
sue
and
mary
are
good
as
can
be
but
your
namesake
contrary
wants
granddaddy
story
and
granddaddy
ditty
and
granddaddy
off
on
a
trot
to
the
city
i
packed
my
belongings
they
tried
to
dissuade
me
sam
wife
said
so
proper
i
really
afraid
we
have
not
succeeded
in
our
entertaining
oh
yes
said
i
some
things
wo
stand
much
explaining
she
really
meant
well
but
of
all
things
provoking
is
a
woman
so
perfect
she
sniffs
when
you
smoking
i
was
glad
to
get
home
it
made
me
quite
silly
to
hear
the
loud
whinny
of
starling
and
billy
and
here
was
the
farm
with
its
orchards
and
meadows
the
big
maple
trees
all
throwing
their
shadows
the
yellow
the
tall
stacks
of
clover
the
wag
of
the
stub
of
a
tail
on
old
rover
and
here
came
dear
mary
her
hat
on
her
shoulder
with
sue
trying
hard
to
catch
her
and
hold
her
here
came
tommy
and
joe
always
foot
in
their
classes
and
bob
with
his
features
all
crumbs
and
molasses
carrying
a
basin
with
fishworms
and
dirt
in
oh
that
scalawag
bob
i
morally
certain
is
a
chip
of
the
old
block
it
just
seemed
to
strike
me
they
named
the
boy
rightly
for
he
was
so
like
me
all
laughing
and
calling
here
grandpa
to
play
with
and
bob
supplementing
and
sleep
and
and
then
such
a
hugging
with
molly
behind
me
the
tears
came
so
fast
that
they
threatened
to
blind
me
my
heart
overflowed
with
sorrow
and
pity
for
the
boy
i
had
left
back
there
in
the
city
his
lot
is
a
hard
one
indeed
i
not
joking
he
lives
with
a
woman
who
sniffs
when
he
smoking
the
supper
we
had
sir
and
when
it
was
over
the
walk
round
the
homestead
close
followed
by
rover
who
most
like
a
human
you
fancy
him
saying
see
those
stacks
oh
yes
we
have
finished
the
haying
that
colt
should
be
broken
old
friend
i
just
mention
this
farm
stands
in
need
of
our
closest
attention
and
when
the
lamp
lighted
with
mary
beside
me
the
boys
at
my
feet
and
bob
up
astride
me
i
felt
like
a
king
i
really
ca
write
it
molly
must
take
my
pipe
and
fill
it
and
light
it
then
plump
herself
down
in
her
own
little
rocker
for
a
visit
with
me
oh
she
is
a
talker
worth
the
listening
to
the
threshing
was
over
joe
had
got
ten
dollars
a
ton
for
the
clover
deacon
hope
had
had
a
sharp
tiff
with
the
preacher
over
immersion
and
the
pretty
intended
to
marry
resigned
her
position
yes
most
of
the
church
folks
had
signed
the
petition
against
granting
a
license
to
baker
saloon
the
thanksgiving
service
would
be
coming
on
soon
the
neighbors
were
hearty
had
every
one
missed
me
right
here
molly
stood
on
her
and
kissed
me
sho
sam
wife
is
handsome
and
cultured
and
clever
but
she
not
the
woman
that
molly
is
never
molly
smile
is
so
kind
and
her
hair
is
so
glossy
her
brown
eyes
look
at
you
so
sweet
and
so
saucy
yes
joe
richer
than
sam
though
joe
but
a
farmer
for
his
home
atmosphere
is
brighter
and
warmer
sam
has
lots
of
money
there
no
use
denying
has
made
himself
wealthy
and
that
without
trying
but
what
chance
has
a
man
indeed
i
not
joking
who
lives
with
a
woman
who
sniffs
when
he
smoking
jack
jack
dead
an
buried
it
seems
odd
a
deep
hole
covered
up
with
sod
lyin
out
there
on
the
hill
an
jack
as
never
could
keep
still
a
sleepin
in
it
jack
could
race
and
do
it
at
a
good
old
pace
could
sing
a
song
an
laugh
so
hard
that
i
could
hear
him
in
our
yard
when
he
was
half
a
mile
away
why
not
another
boy
could
play
like
him
or
run
or
jump
so
high
or
swim
no
matter
how
he
try
an
i
ca
get
it
through
my
head
at
all
at
all
that
jack
is
dead
jack
mother
did
use
to
be
so
awful
good
to
him
and
me
for
often
when
i
go
down
there
on
saturdays
when
it
was
fair
to
get
him
out
to
fish
or
skate
she
catch
me
hangin
round
the
gate
and
look
as
cross
as
some
old
hen
an
tell
me

the
thing
for
boys

a
hangin
round
the
creek
all
day
you
go
off
home
and
do
your
task
no
jack
ca
go
you
need
ask
and
when
he
got
in
scrapes
why
she
would
up
and
lay
it
on
to
me
an
wish
i
lived
so
far
away
jack
could
see
me
every
day
but
last
night
when
i
done
the
chores
it
seemed
so
out
of
doors
i
kept

listenin

while

mile
i
could
bear

him
half
as
much
at
the
sick
children
hospital
a
little
crippled
figure
two
big
pathetic
eyes
a
face
that
looked
unchildish
so
wan
it
was
and
wise
i
watched
her
as
the
homesick
tears
came
chasing
down
each
cheek
i
had
to
come
she
whispered
low
i
was
so
tired
and
weak
my
spine
you
know
i
used
to
be
so
strong
and
tall
and
straight
i
went
to
school
and
learned
to
read
and
write
upon
a
slate
and
add
up
figures
such
a
lot
and
play
with
all
my
might
until
i
hurt
my
back
since
then
i
just
ache
day
and
night
is
most
a
year
since
i
could
stand
or
walk
around
at
all
all
i
am
good
for
now
you
see
is
just
to
cry
and
crawl
poor
thing
there
came
to
us
the
laughter
gay
and
sweet
of
little
ones
let
out
from
school
the
sound
of
flying
feet
she
listened
for
a
moment
then
turned
her
to
the
wall
to
hide
the
tears
oh
me
she
cried
i
tired
of
it
all
i
feel
so
hurt
and
useless
why
ca
i
run
about
as
others
do
some
day
please
god
you
will
i
said
but
doubt
was
in
the
eyes
she
turned
on
mine
and
doubt
was
in
her
tone
perhaps
she
faltered
then
the
pain
grew
harsh
the
plaintive
moan
smote
sharply
on
my
heart
i
knew
she
had
but
lately
come
from
mother
care
and
father
love
and
all
the
joys
of
home
i
wished
i
lived
on
earth
she
sobbed
a
long
long
time
ago
when
jesus
came
at
eventide
because
he
loved
folks
so
and
just
by
stretching
out
his
hand
made
all
the
sick
folks
well
if
it
were
now
oh
would
i
creep
close
to
him
and
tell
all
that
i
wanted
him
to
do
i
kneel
down
low
and
say
is
my
back
dear
jesus
please
cure
it
right
away
i
tired
of
being
weak
and
sick
i
want
to
jump
and
run
and
play
at
games
and
laugh
out
loud
and
have
such
heaps
of
fun
be
good
to
your
poor
crippled
girl
and
he
would
touch
me
so
and
every
atom
of
the
pain
and
crookedness
would
go
i
held
her
close
and
kissed
her
and
soothed
her
off
to
rest
so
frail
she
was
so
homesick
for
the
ones
she
loved
the
best
but
yesterday
i
saw
her
and
would
have
passed
her
by
had
i
not
caught
the
greeting
smile
the
glance
so
bright
and
shy
can
this
be
you
i
questioned
she
laughed
o
yes
i
thought
you
hardly
know
me
when
you
came
i
changed
oh
such
a
lot
for
see
how
tall
and
straight
i
am
my
back
do
hurt
at
all
and
i
can
stand
and
i
can
walk
i
never
have
to
crawl
i
tell
you
it
a
secret
i
raced
with
nurse
last
night
just
think
of
it
i
raced
and
won
and
then
in
sheer
delight
she
laughed
so
loudly
and
so
long
the
nurse
looked
in
to
say
is
not
this
little
girl
of
ours
quite
boisterous
they
are
so
good
to
me
she
said
i
know
i
want
to
cry
when
i
start
off
for
home
next
week
and
have
to
say
what
if
i
had
come
at
all
the
sweet
blue
eyes
grew
wet
my
back
would
ache
and
throb
and
hurt
i
be
a
cripple
yet
for
folks
as
poor
as
my
folks
are
they
have
much
to
spare
for
nurse
bills
and
doctor
bills
and
all
but
wo
they
stare
when
i
go
home
and
straight
and
fat
as
i
can
be
my
daddy
he
will
never
take
his
dear
eyes
off
of
me
my
mamma
she
will
cry
some
tears
and
bend
her
head
and
pray
while
all
the
others
kiss
and
hug
then
i
can
hear
her
say
me
my
girlie
she
been
gone
so
many
long
months
five
and
hold
me
close
oh
i
will
be
the
gladdest
thing
alive

a
score
of
years
since
i
heard
the
pipes
but
the
other
night
i
heard
them
there
are
sweet
old
memories
in
my
heart
and
the
music
woke
and
stirred
them
in
the
armories
at
the
big
parade
the
highland
regiment
was
giving
a
pipers
piping
away
ah

music
as
sure

his
head
at
me
and
glowered
with
every
feature
and
a
pretty
young
lassie
just
behind

funny
old
creature
but
the
skirl
o
the
pipes

in
my
ears

the
pipes
wild
sound
disna

my
bluid
he
was
not
born
in
the
highlands
do
you
know
what
i
saw
as
i
sat
there
i
saw
the
hills
and
the
heather
the
green
and
the
lads
and
the
lassies
there
all
dancing
the
reels
together
i
saw
our
glen
half
hid
and
the
rocks
standing
guard
like
grim
old
watchmen
oh
the
land
o
heather
and
hill
and
loch
must
be
dear
to
a
scotchman
and
i
saw
too
the
soldiers
blithe
and
brave
their
flag
to
the
breeze
unfurling
as
they
marched
away
on
a
morning
fair
to
the
bagpipes
merry
skirling
my
brother
was
one
as
he
kissed
my
cheek
i
could
hear
him
proudly
saying
ho
you
know
when
we
come
marching
home
for
you
hear
our
pipers
playing
oh
the
bonniest
lads
in
kilt
and
hose
braver
men
you
can
not
find
them
and
few
so
few
came
marching
home
to
the
loved
ones
left
behind
them
was
a
loyal
heart
and
a
strong
right
arm
with
a
stubborn
foe
before
them
a
soldier
grave
in
a
far
off
land
and
god
blue
sky
bending
them
as
i
hearkened
to
sweet
old
martial
airs
i
could
hear
my
brother
saying
ho
you
know
when
we
come
marching
home
for
you
hear
our
pipers
playing
there
are
only
harps
in
heaven
i
told
and
maybe
i
should
say
it
for
a
harp
of
gold
a
wondrous
thing
in
a
hand
that
skilled
to
play
it
but
those
highland
lads
was
the
pibroch
call
they
heard
morning
noon
and
even
and
the
pibroch
call
i
believe
in
my
heart
they
will
hear
in
the
streets
of
heaven
they
marched
to
the
old
belovèd
airs
the
bullets
hail
and
rattle
was
the
last
sweet
sound
that
fell
on
their
ears
the
clamor
and
clang
of
battle
o
a
harp
when
an
angel
strikes
the
strings
is
softer
and
sweeter
but
try
as
i
will
i
can
not
fancy
a
harp
in
the
hands
of
say
peter
mackay
and
were
an
angel
to
proffer
him
one
methinks
i
can
hear
him
saying
was
not
on
an
instrument
like
the
same
that
pete
mackay
will
be
playing
for
she
neffer
set
eyes
on
it
before
is
quick
to
learn
or
cleffer
she
break
the
strings
if
she
took
it
in
hand
she
could
do
it
whateffer
so
please
be
excusing
old
pete
mackay
but
hark
bring
the
chanter
to
me
i
play
the
o
the
cameron
men
and
afterward
dundee
i
told
this
to
donald
late
that
night
he
said
as
he
sipped
his
toddy
do
ye
ken
ye
shocked
the
elder

the
doited
body
and

that
astoonded
i
hae
the
guid
meenister

tae
ye

heresy
to
believe
in
the
promise
of
the
father
eye
hath
not
seen
ear

i
am
heretical
rather
i

last
loud
trump
shall
sound

old
flag
again
unfurling
my
highland
lads
will
come
marching
home
to
the
bagpipes
grandly
skirling
the
guest
the
wise
men
came
to
the
inn
that
night
now
open
to
us
they
cried
we
have
journeyed
far
that
we
might
kneel
to
one
who
doth
here
abide
the
door
was
opened
with
eager
haste
of
whom
do
ye
come
in
quest
can
it
be
that
a
lord
of
high
degree
is
with
us
this
night
as
guest
the
wise
men
answered
the
eastern
sky
is
luminous
still
and
clear
with
the
radiance
of
a
golden
star
that
hath
led
our
footsteps
here
blessed
o
keeper
this
inn
of
thine
both
thatch
and
foundation
stone
for
the
open
door
and
warm
when
the
king
came
to
his
own
the
king
the
king
loud
the
keeper
cry
the
king
in
this
house
of
mine

the
place
aglow

the
meat
and
the
wine
the
king
let
the
be
prepared
honor
and
homage
we
pay
to
royal
son
of
a
royal
line
who
tarries
with
us
from
room
to
room
of
the
inn
they
went
the
wise
men
and
keeper
proud
but
not
a
trace
of
the
one
they
sought
found
they
in
that
motley
crowd
you
have
other
guests
the
wise
men
asked
and
the
keeper
face
flamed
red
but
a
straggling
pair
who
came
so
late
they
found
neither
room
nor
bed
my
masters
a
lad
said
timidly
as
i
gave
the
cattle
feed
came
creeping
down
to
the
stable
door
a
woman
in
sorest
need
i
made
her
a
bed
in
the
manger
low
at
head
of
the
oxen
mild
and
masters
i
heard
a
moan
of
pain
then
the
cry
of
a
child
a
prince
shalt
thou
be
the
wise
men
cried
for
hearkening
to
that
moan
a
prince
shalt
thou
be
for
succor
given
when
the
king
came
to
his
own
nay
i
but
a
he
smiled
with
his
eager
eyes
aglow
no
king
but
a
little
naked
child
sleeps
out
in
my
manger
low
hast
come
to
these
homes
of
ours
o
christ
in
quest
of
a
meal
or
bed
and
found
no
welcoming
cheer
set
forth
nor
place
to
pillow
thine
head
give
us
a
heart
aflame
with
love
filled
with
a
pity
divine
then
come
thou
as
beggar
or
babe
or
king
the
best
that
we
have
is
thine
soldiers
all
they
praying
for
the
soldier
lads
in
grim
old
london
town
last
night
i
went
myself
and
heard
a
bishop
in
his
gown
confiding
to
the
lord
of
hosts
his
views
of
this
affair
we
do
petition
thee
he
said
to
have
a
watchful
care
of
all
the
stalwart
men
and
strong
who
at
their
country
call
went
sailing
off
to
africa
to
fight
perchance
to
fall
amen
a
thousand
voices
cried
i
whispered
low
dear
lord
a
host
is
praying
for
the
men
i
want
to
say
a
word
for
those
who
stay
at
home
and
wait
the
mothers
and
the
wives
keep
close
to
them
and
help
them
bear
their
cheerless
empty
lives
the
bishop
prayed
our
cause
is
good
our
quarrel
right
and
just
the
god
of
battles
is
our
god
and
in
his
arm
we
trust
he
never
got
that
prayer
of
his
in
any
printed
book
it
came
straight
from
the
heart
of
him
his
deep
voice
how
it
shook
and
something
glistened
in
his
eye
and
down
his
flushed
cheek
ran
i
like
a
bishop
best
of
all
when
he
is
just
a
man
amen
they
cried
out
louder
still
but
i
bent
low
my
head
dear
christ
be
kind
to
hearts
that
break
for
loved
ones
dying
dead
keep
close
to
women
folk
who
wait
beset
with
anxious
fears
the
watchers
whose
dim
eyes
are
filled
with
bitter
tears
i
know
dear
christ
how
hard
it
is
i
whispered
as
i
kneeled
for
long
ago
my
bonnie
boy
fell
on
the
battlefield
find
comfort
for
the
broken
hearts
of
those
weighed
down
with
love
and
longing
for
the
ones
in
danger
far
away
they
will
not
shrink
the
bishop
prayed
nor
fear
a
soldier
grave
nay
each
man
will
acquit
himself
like
briton
true
and
brave
god
of
battles
march
with
them
keep
guard
by
day
and
night
and
arm
them
with
a
trust
in
thee
when
they
go
up
to
fight
amen
a
sound
of
muffled
sobs
the
deep
voice
trembled
some
but
i
with
hot
tears
on
my
face
prayed
hard
for
those
at
home
keep
watch
and
ward
of
all
that
wait
in
fever
of
unrest
who
said
and
let
them
go
the
ones
they
loved
the
best
o
comfort
christ
above
the
din
of
martial
clamor
hark
the
saddest
sound
in
all
god
world
a
crying
in
the
dark
as
good
as
a
girl
oh
a
big
fellow
was
ben
and
homely
as
you
would
see
such
an
awkward
walker
and
stammering
talker
and
as
bashful
as
he
could
be
the
son
of
a
lone
widowed
mother
was
he
and
right
well
did
he
act
his
part
a
giant
at
sowing
and
reaping
and
mowing
his
farm
was
the
pride
of
his
heart
his
mother
depended
on
his
strong
arm
in
the
cottage
so
neat
and
trim
he
kept
the
fires
burning
did
sweeping
and
churning
oh
the
odd
jobs
saved
up
for
him
my
ben
a
comfort
she
said
every
day
with
pride
that
made
his
head
whirl
as
handy
at
sweeping
as
he
is
at
reaping
ben
is
just
as
good
as
a
girl
a
fellow
to
work
round
the
house
we
call
him
ben
said
the
girls
but
ben
heaven
bless
him
never
let
this
distress
him
till
there
came
a
day
when
the
curls
and
blue
eyes
of
gladys
the
prettiest
girl
and
the
proudest
in
all
the
place
his
young
heart
set
beating
at
every
chance
meeting
though
she
only
laughed
in
his
face
i
have
none
but
a
gay
and
a
gallant
man
her
lips
took
a
scornful
curl
your
pride
is
in
hearing
your
mother
declaring
is
just
as
good
as
a
girl
but
sweet
little
marjory
laughed
not
at
ben
he
was
homely
awkward
shy
but
she
liked
the
fellow
whose
voice
was
so
mellow
and
she
smiled
as
she
passed
him
by
he
went
to
the
front
when
the
war
broke
out
and
filled
his
post
like
a
man
the
giant
was
bold
and
defiant
as
soon
as
the
battle
began
you
never
have
thought
of
the
broom
and
the
churn
nor
of
the
nickname
miss
ben
had
you
heard
his
voice
cheering
seen
his
arm
clearing
a
path
for
his
own
gallant
men
capt
benjamin
brooks
he
came
riding
home
when
the
war
was
over
and
done
as
homely
and
backward
as
shy
and
as
awkward
as
tender
and
loyal
a
son
now
gladys
gave
him
her
sunniest
smile
on
heroes
she
ever
did
dote
and
the
proud
little
beauty
felt
it
her
duty
to
be
kind
to
this
young
man
of
note
but
ben
wise
fellow
liked
marjory
best
he
knew
her
lips
did
not
curl
when
mother
said
sweetly
ben
does
work
so
neatly
he
is
just
as
good
as
a
girl
so
he
wooed
and
won
this
marjory
true
and
made
her
his
loving
bride
while
gladys
she
fretted
bemoaned
and
regretted
the
goal
she
had
missed
by
her
pride
ben
is
filling
a
prominent
place
a
statesman
honest
and
bold
he
frees
the
opprest
and
he
helps
the
distrest
wins
love
which
is
better
than
gold
for
the
very
grandest
men

find
in
this
great

allan
o

the
harbor

thomas
gordon
left
home
one
day
left
home
for
good
and
all
a
boy
has
a
right
to
have
his
own
way
when
he
nearly
six
foot
tall
at
least
this
is
what
thomas
thought
and
in
his
own
young
eyes
there
were
very
few
people
quite
so
good
and
fewer
still
quite
so
wise
what
tie
as
clever
a
lad
as
he
down
to
commonplace
toil
make
thomas
gordon
a
farmer
lad
a
simple
son
of
the
soil
not
if
he
knew
it
be
a
sin
he
wished
to
rise
and
soar
for
men
like
himself
who
would
do
and
dare
dame
fortune
had
much
in
store
the
world
was
in
need
of
brains
and
brawn
thomas
said
modestly
the
clever
young
man
was
in
great
demand
they
would
see
what
they
would
see
he
would
make
his
mark
in
the
busy
world
some
day
the
daily
press
would
herald
the
glad
news
forth
to
the
throng
thomas
is
a
success
then
would
the
doubters
and
sceptics
all
say
with
regret
sincere
to
think
that
we
gave
his
hopes
and
his
aims
but
an
unbelieving
sneer
as
for
him
he
would
kiss
his
mother
and
give
her
wealth
galore
shake
the
hand
of
his
father
maybe
then
back
to
the
world
once
more
with
big
ambition
and
high
conceit
was
young
thomas
filled
the
warning
of
friends
and
their
arguments
his
eloquence
quickly
stilled
you
may
go
said
the
irate
father
i
not
urge
you
to
stay
you
will
learn
your
lesson
you
headstrong
fool
be
glad
to
come
back
some
day
so
thomas
gordon
left
the
farm
as
boys
have
done
before
and
his
mother
began
to
count
the
hours
till
he
would
be
home
once
more
the
father
wearied
as
time
went
on
missed
the
boy
from
his
side
but
all
through
the
years
the
fond
mother
kept
her
love
her
hope
and
her
pride
with
a
mother
beautiful
faith
she
said
i
know
my
boy
will
come
so
wealthy
so
honored
noble
and
great
proudly
come
marching
home
and
ever
she
looked
at
eventide
into
the
glowing
west
for
the
dust
of
the
carriage
bringing
her
the
one
that
she
loved
the
best
ah
how
she
longed
to
look
on
his
face
her
stalwart
lad
and
true
with
his
sunburned
cheek
and
his
ruddy
hair
and
his
eyes
so
bright
and
blue
to
those
who
said
was
cruel
of
him
never
a
line
to
send
she
had
but
one
answer
with
eyes
ashine
it
will
all
come
right
in
the
end
he
busy
making
a
name
and
place
and
i
must
patient
be
till
this
clever
ambitious
lad
of
mine
finds
time
to
come
back
to
me
important
and
wealthy
and
famous
honored
and
wise
and
great
but
look
you
who
can
that
ragged
tramp
be
down
there
by
the
garden
gate
pale
as
if
hunger
had
pressed
him
sore
trembling
because
so
weak
pushed
on
by
his
longing
held
back
by
shame
a
tear
on
his
poor
pale
cheek
is
he
had
he
come
back
rich
and
great
she
have
met
him
at
the
door
but
she
down
the
path
with
her
arms
outspread
because
he
has
come
back
poor
gone
gone
are
her
sweet
and
fair
gone
in
the
swift
glad
shock
of
folding
a
ragged
tramp
in
her
arms
but
love
stands
firm
as
a
rock
she
rang
the
dinner
bell
long
and
loud
the
father
came
with
speed
the
welcome
he
gave
the
prodigal
was
a
tender
one
indeed
the
young
fool
has
learned
his
lesson
thomas
whispered
low
so
he
has
god
bless
him
the
father
cried
he
make
a
good
man
i
know
honest
unselfish
and
true
as
steel
our
boy
will
stand
the
test
kindly
of
thought
and
word
and
deed
the
homely
virtues
are
best
i
knew
when
you
went
and
you
know
it
now
that
all
this
pride
and
style
this
yearnin
to
fill
up
the
public
eye
is
really
worth
the
while
oh
the
happy
face
of
the
mother
that
night
as
kneeling
low
tom
said
the
prayer
that
he
used
to
say
at
her
knee
so
long
ago
a
new
thomas
had
this
to
add
with
his
bonnie
blue
eyes
wet
thank
god
for
the
home
for
the
faithful
hearts
that
never
change
or
forget
though
far
and
wide
on
the
world
rough
sea
the
children
reckless
roam
the
boldest
thanks
god
in
some
stress
of
storm
for
the
harbor
lights
of
home
the
preacher
down
at
coles
he
was
not
especially
handsome
he
was
not
especially
smart
a
great
big
lumbering
fellow
with
a
soft
and
tender
heart
his
eyes
were
gray
and
honest
his
smile
a
friendly
one
he
wore
his
parson
suit
of
black
on
days
of
state
alone
at
other
times
he
went
around
in
clothes
the
worse
of
wear
a
blue
cloth
cap
set
jauntily
upon
his
thick
gray
hair
he
cared
so
little
how
he
looked
so
little
how
he
drest
that
he
tired
the
patience
sorely
of
the
ones
he
loved
the
best
for
a
preacher
so
they
argued
should
be
dressed
like
one
of
course
but
in
the
winter
it
was
tweeds
in
summer
it
was
worse
ducks
and
flannels
would
be
grimy
if
the
sad
truth
must
be
told
for
he
spaded
up
the
gardens
of
the
people
who
were
old
and
he
ran
down
dusty
highways
at
unministerial
rate
going
errands
for
the
people
who
really
could
not
wait
his
would
be
short
an
inch
his
trousers
just
the
same
for
the
washerwoman
had
them
every
week
that
ever
came
he
cared
so
little
how
he
looked
and
never
paused
to
think
that
linen
duck
and
flannel
were
such
awful
things
to
shrink
his
wife
she
was
the
primmest
thing
as
neat
as
any
doll
and
looked
like
one
when
walking
by
her
husband
big
and
tall
it
almost
broke
her
heart
that
he
refused
to
give
a
thought
to
how
he
looked
or
do
the
thing
or
say
the
thing
he
ought
sometimes
though
well
she
loved
him
quite
high
her
temper
ran
for
is
hard
on
any
woman
to
have
such
a
careless
man
think
when
the
conference
president
came
visiting
the
place
the
preacher
down
at
coles
he
had
a
badly
battered
face
one
eye
was
black
as
black
could
be
he
looked
so
we
been
told
more
like
a
fierce
than
a
shepherd
of
the
fold
how
did
it
happen
questioned
him
the
visitor
so
wise
with
hint
of
laughter
on
his
lips
and
in
his
twinkling
eyes
old
betty
brown
the
preacher
said
his
wife
broke
in
just
here
a
spinster
of
the
place
who
hates
him
that
is
clear
and
never
did
a
woman
have
a
meaner
tongue
than
hers
the
slighting
things
she
says
of
him
the
mischief
that
she
stirs
fields
have
we
said
the
president
in
country
and
in
town
believe
me
madam
most
of
them
can
boast
a
betty
brown
the
preacher
stroked
his
blackened
eye
and
laughed
she
does
like
me
very
well
but
what
of
that
said
he
the
other
night
i
found
the
poor
old
creature
sick
in
bed
she
want
no
prayin
done
she
very
quickly
said
so
seeing
that
she
was
so
ill
and
worn
she
could
not
stir
i
thought
with
care
and
patience
i
could
milk
the
cow
for
her
i
stroked
old
spot
caressingly
and
placed
my
little
can
but
spot
she
knew
and
i
came
home
a
sadder
wiser
man
the
preacher
down
at
coles
he
was
no
orator
at
all
but
sick
and
sad
and
sinful
were
glad
to
have
him
call
not
that
he
ever
found
a
host
of
happy
things
to
say
in
fact
as
far
as
talking
went
he
might
have
stayed
away
but
oh
the
welcome
that
he
got
i
think
his
big
right
hand
gave
such
a
grip
that
all
the
rest
they
seemed
to
understand
some
of
the
congregation
would
have
liked
a
different
man
he
could
hope
to
please
them
all
few
ministers
that
can
once
at
the
district
meeting
the
good
old
farmer
bowles
stood
up
and
spoke
his
mind
about
the
preacher
down
at
coles
there
not
he
said
you
know
it
too
a
better
man
than
he
an
you
carpin
folk
i
say
this
reverently
if
the
lord
take
an
angel
and
gently
turn
him
loose
to
preach
down
here
do
you
suppose
he
please
the
hull
caboose
not
much
it
human
nature
to
quarrel
with
what
we
got
an
this
man
is
a
better
man
than
we
deserve
a
lot
but
he
did
preach
curious
sermons
just
as
dry
as
they
could
be
and
the
old
folks
slumbered
through
them
every
sabbath
peacefully
but
they
all
woke
up
the
moment
the
singing
would
begin
and
not
an
ear
was
found
too
dull
to
drink
the
music
in
for
though
the
preacher
could
not
boast
an
orator
smooth
tongue
he
could
reach
the
people
when
he
stood
up
there
and
sung
o
the
wondrous
power
and
sweetness
of
the
voice
that
filled
the
place
everyone
that
heard
it
swelling
grew
the
purer
for
a
space
and
men
could
not
choose
but
listen
to
the
singer
standing
there
till
their
worldliness
slipped
from
them
and
their
selfishness
and
care
mourners
turned
their
eyes
all
misty
from
the
crosses
tall
and
white
where
their
loved
ones
slumbered
softly
all
the
day
and
all
the
night
listening
faith
rose
triumphant
over
sorrow
loss
and
pain
heaven
was
not
a
country
they
would
meet
their
own
again
and
the
men
and
women
wished
the
singing
need
not
cease
for
they
seemed
to
see
the
beauty
of
the
longed
for
land
of
peace
upward
soared
that
voice
and
upward
with
a
sweetness
naught
could
stem
till
each
dim
eye
caught
the
glory
of
the
new
jerusalem
he
was
such
a
curious
fellow
the
preacher
down
at
coles
one
winter
day
the
word
was
brought
to
town
by
farmer
bowles
that
in
a
little
shanty
in
the
hollow
by
the
mill
were
children
gaunt
with
hunger
a
mother
sad
and
ill
the
father
just
a
drunkard
a
vagabond
who
left
his
family
for
long
long
weeks
of
love
and
care
bereft
the
squire
talked
of
taking
a
big
subscription
up
and
talked
and
talked
while
in
that
house
was
neither
bite
nor
sup
o
these
talking
folks
these
talking
folks
the
poor
would
starve
and
freeze
if
the
succoring
and
caring
were
done
by
such
as
these
the
preacher
down
at
coles
he
had
not
very
much
to
say
he
harnessed
up
the
old
roan
horse
and
hitched
it
to
the
sleigh
and
piled
in
so
much
provisions
that
his
wife
said
tearfully
she
did
have
a
cake
or
pie
left
in
the
house
for
tea
he
filled
the
sleigh
with
baskets
and
with
bundles
such
a
pile
heaps
of
wood
and
clothes
and
victuals
everybody
had
to
smile
as
they
watched
the
old
roan
canter
down
the
crossroad
the
hill
to
the
little
cheerless
shanty
in
the
hollow
by
the
mill
the
preacher
built
a
fire
and
bade
the
children
warm
their
toes
while
he
heard
the
mother
tale
of
miseries
and
woes
he
brought
in
a
bag
of
flour
and
a
turkey
big
and
fat
his
dainty
wife
had
meant
to
dine
the
ladies
aid
on
that
he
brought
in
ham
and
butter
and
potatoes
in
a
sack
a
pie
or
two
a
loaf
of
cake
and
doughnuts
such
a
stack
ah
his
wife
and
her
good
handmaid
had
been
baking
many
a
day
for
the
ladies
aid
would
dine
there
he
had
lugged
it
all
away
he
brought
in
a
pair
of
blankets
and
a
heavy
woollen
quilt
betty
brown
who
happened
in
there
said
she
thought
that
she
would
wilt
for
these
things
the
active
members
of
the
missionary
band
had
gathered
for
the
heathen
in
a
foreign
land
these
belong
unto
the
lord
sir
betty
said
i
think
you
find
but
he
answered
her
quite
gently
very
well
he
will
not
mind
to
see
him
making
tea
for
the
woman
in
the
bed
made
me
wish
i
had
been
kinder
to
the
preacher
betty
said
though
he
was
so
big
and
clumsy
he
could
step
around
so
light
and
to
see
him
getting
dinner
to
the
children
huge
delight
it
was
not
till
he
had
warmed
them
and
had
fed
them
there
that
day
that
he
whispered
very
softly
little
children
let
us
pray
then
he
gave
them
to
the
keeping
of
a
father
kind
and
wise
in
a
way
that
brought
the
into
hard
old
betty
eyes
she
felt
an
aching
in
her
throat
and
when
she
cried
amen
other
folks
might
flout
the
preacher
betty
never
would
again
he
took
up
the
fresh
air
movement
but
the
people
down
at
coles
shook
their
head
a
preacher
work
they
said
was
saving
precious
souls
not
worrying
lest
the
waifs
and
strays
that
throng
the
city
street
should
pine
for
want
of
country
air
and
country
food
to
eat
lawyer
angus
at
the
meeting
spoke
against
things
seems
to
me
our
preacher
bow
friends
has
a
muckle
lot
of
strings
merchant
jones
said
trade
was
failing
rent
was
high
and
clerks
to
pay
not
a
dollar
could
he
give
them
he
was
very
grieved
to
say
old
squire
hays
was
buying
timber
needed
every
cent
and
more
doctor
blake
sat
coldly
smiling
then
the
farmer
took
the
floor
wish
he
said
our
hearts
were
bigger
an
our
speeches
not
so
long
i
would
move
right
here
the
preacher
tunes
us
up
a
little
song
sing
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
him
simple
songs
of
long
ago
old
familiar
things
that
held
us
warm
that
golden
voice
and
low
songs
of
summer
in
the
woodlands
cowslips
yellow
in
the
vale
songs
of
summer
in
the
city
and
the
children
wan
and
pale
till
we
saw
the
pavement
pressed
by
tired
little
feet
heard
the
baby
voices
crying
for
the
meadows
wide
and
sweet
now
we
take
up
the
collection
said
the
wily
farmer
bowles
and
they
showered
in
their
money
did
the
people
down
at
coles
here
a
cheque
said
lawyer
angus
is
the
best
that
i
can
do
man
you
have
us
in
the
poorhouse
if
you
sang
your
sermons
through
the
very
careless
fellow
still
goes
his
cheery
way
unmindful
of
what
people
think
or
of
what
people
say
some
still
are
finding
fault
with
him
he
does
mind
it
much
laughs
when
they
make
remarks
about
his
clothes
and
shoes
and
such
declare
his
sermons
have
no
point
and
quarrel
with
his
text
as
people
will
but
oh
it
makes
his
pretty
wife
so
vext
i
think
she
says
as
much
of
him
as
any
woman
can
but
is
most
aggravating
to
have
such
a
careless
man
there
are
those
who
think
him
perfect
shout
his
praises
with
a
will
he
has
labored
for
the
master
he
is
laboring
for
him
still
and
the
grumbling
does
not
move
him
nor
the
praises
sung
abroad
things
like
these
seem
only
trifles
to
the
man
who
works
for
god
farmer
bowles
summed
up
the
total
in
his
own
original
way
when
he
spoke
at
the
convention
that
was
held
the
other
day
never
knew
a
better
worker
never
knew
a
kinder
man
lots
of
preachers
are
more
stylish
keep
themselves
so
you
could
spot
out
for
preachers
if
you
met
walkin
round
over
on
the
fejee
islands
silk
hat
long
coat
i
be
bound
man
different
but
i
tell
you
when
it
comes
to
doing
good
there
not
one
can
beat
him
at
it
an
i
want
this
understood
ask
the
sad
folks
and
the
sinful
ask
the
fallen
ones
he
raised
ask
the
sick
folks
and
the
poor
folks
if
you
want
to
hear
him
praised
orator
well
maybe
not
friends
but
in
caring
for
men
souls
there
stand
few
men
half
so
faithful
as
the
preacher
down
at
coles
chore
time
when
i
at
on
the
farm
i
hear
along
six
just
when
i
feelin
snug
an
warm
ho
bobby
come
and
feed
your
stock
i
jump
an
get
into
my
clothes
it
dark
as
pitch
an
shivers
run
all
up
my
back
now
i
suppose
not
many
boys
would
think
this
fun
but
when
we
get
out
to
the
barn
the
greedy
pigs
begin
to
squeal
an
i
throw
in
the
yellow
corn
a
bushel
basket
to
the
meal
then
i
begin
to
warm
right
up
i
whistle
yankee
doodle
through
an
wrastle
with
the
collie
pup
and
sometimes
whistles
too
the
door
it
makes
a
din
each
time
we
swing
it
open
wide
i
run
an
flash
the
lantern
in
there
stand
the
shorthorns
side
by
side
their
breathin
makes
a
sort
of
cloud
above
their
heads
there
no
frost
here
my
beauties
says
out
loud
you
get
your
breakfasts
never
fear
when
up
i
climb
into
the
loft
to
fill
their
racks
with
clover
hay
their
eyes
all
sleepy
like
and
soft
a
heap
of
nice
things
seem
to
say
the
red
ox
shakes
his
curly
head
an
turns
on
me
a
solemn
face
i
know
he
awful
glad
his
shed
is
such
a
warm
and
smelly
place
an
last
of
all
the
stable
big
with
harness
hanging
on
each
door
i
always
want
to
dance
a
jig
on
that
old
musty
dusty
floor
it
seems
so
good
to
be
alive
an
tendin
to
the
sturdy
grays
the
sorrels
and
old
prince
that
five
an
lightfoot
with
her
coaxing
ways
my
tells
me
she
is
mine
an
i
that
proud
i
braid
her
mane
an
smooth
her
sides
until
they
shine
an
do
my
best
to
make
her
vain
when
we
have
measured
oats
for
all
have
slapped
the
grays
upon
the
flanks
an
tried
to
pat
the
sorrels
tall
an
heard
them
whinny
out
their
thanks
we
know
it
breakfast
time
and
go
out
past
the
yellow
stacks
of
straw
across
the
creek
that
used
to
flow
but
wo
flow
now
until
a
thaw
behind
the
trees
the
sky
is
pink
the
snow
drifts
by
in
fat
white
flakes
my
says
well
bob
i
think
there
comes
a
smell
of
buckwheat
cakes
a
boy
trials
when
i
was
but
a
little
lad
one
thing
i
could
not
bear
it
was
to
stand
at
mother
knee
and
have
her
comb
my
hair
they
did
keep
boys
hair
as
short
as
it
kept
and
mine
was
always
tangled
up
in
twenty
different
ways
i
twist
my
mouth
and
grit
my
teeth
and
say
it
was
fair
it
was
a
trial
and
no
mistake
when
mother
combed
my
hair
she
brush
and
brush
each
stubborn
curl
that
grew
upon
my
pate
and
with
her
scissors
nip
and
clip
to
make
the
edges
straight
then
smooth
it
down
until
it
shone
while
i
would
grin
and
bear
and
feel
a
martyr
through
and
through
when
mother
combed
my
hair
she
take
my
round
chin
in
her
hand
and
hold
it
there
the
while
she
made
the
parting
carefully
then
tell
me
with
a
smile
do
push
your
cap
down
on
your
curls
and
spoil
my
work
and
care
he
is
a
pretty
little
lad
when
mother
combs
his
hair
i
hurry
out
and
rumple
up
that
mop
of
hair
so
thick
a
vandal
i
for
she
had
worked
so
hard
to
make
it
slick
and
wish
i
were
a
man
so
nobody
would
dare
to
put
a
washrag
in
my
ears
or
comb
my
tangled
hair
heigho
now
that
i
bald
and
gray
methinks
i
would
be
glad
to
have
her
smooth
my
brow
and
cheeks
and
whisper
mother
lad
a
longing
for
the
days
doth
take
me
unaware
to
stand
a
boy
at
mother
knee
and
have
her
comb
my
hair
an
april
fool
of
long
ago
in
powdered
wig
and
buckled
shoe
coat
and
waistcoat
gay
the
wealthy
squire
rode
forth
to
woo
upon
a
first
of
april
day
he
would
forget
his
lofty
birth
his
spreading
acres
and
his
pride
and
betty
fairest
maid
on
earth
should
be
his
own
his
grateful
bride
the
maid
was
young
and
he
was
old
the
maid
was
good
to
look
upon
naught
cared
she
for
his
land
or
gold
her
love
was
for
the
good
squire
son
he
found
her
as
the
noonday
hush
lay
on
the
world
and
called
her
name
she
looked
up
conscious
and
her
blush
a
tender
interest
did
proclaim
for
he
was
hubert
sire
and
she
to
keep
a
secret
tryst
did
go
he
said
methinks
she
cares
for
me
that
april
fool
of
long
ago
the
flattered
squire
his
suit
did
press
without
delay
say
wilt
thou
come
he
said
with
pompous
tenderness
and
share
my
wealth
and
grace
my
home
kind
sir
the
lovely
betty
cried
i
but
a
lass
of
low
degree
the
love
that
is
controlled
by
pride
is
not
true
love
at
all
quoth
he
i
hold
a
man
should
woo
and
wed
he
wills
should
please
himself
there
is
the
barrier
strong
she
said
of
pedigree
and
place
and
pelf
could
one
so
lowly
hope
to
grace
your
home
right
proud
his
air
and
tone
you
pure
of
heart
and
fair
of
face
dear
betty
you
would
grace
a
throne
since
you
so
highly
think
of
me
her
tears
and
laughter
were
at
strife
you
will
not
mind
so
much
maybe
that
i
am
hubert
promised
wife
pale
went
the
good
squire
florid
cheek
his
wrath
flamed
out
but
betty
stood
and
meek
a
sight
to
make
a
bad
man
good
she
won
on
him
but
why
this
guile
this
secrecy
his
voice
was
rough
we
feared
she
whispered
with
a
smile
you
would
not
think
me
good
enough
an
april
fool
am
i
come
come
my
offer
stands
as
hubert
wife
he
laughed
you
share
my
wealth
and
home
and
brighten
up
a
lonely
life
he
kissed
her
cheek
and
rode
away
unbroken
was
his
heart
i
wist
for
he
was
thinking
of
a
day
a
day
back
in
youth
rosy
mist
and
of
a
form
and
of
a
face
my
dear
dead
love
he
whispered
low
the
while
he
rode
at
sober
pace
that
april
fool
of
long
ago
for
he
was
scotch
and
so
was
she
they
were
a
couple
well
content
with
what
they
earned
and
what
they
spent
cared
not
a
whit
for
style
decree
for
he
was
scotch
and
so
was
she
and
oh
they
loved
to
talk
of
burns
dear
blithesome
tender
bobby
burns
they
never
wearied
of
his
song
he
never
sang
a
note
too
strong
one
little
fault
could
neither
see
for
he
was
scotch
and
so
was
she
they
loved
to
read
of
men
who
stood
and
gave
for
country
life
and
blood
who
held
their
faith
so
grand
a
thing
they
scorned
to
yield
it
to
a
king
ah
proud
of
such
they
well
might
be
for
he
was
scotch
and
so
was
she
from
neighbors
broils
they
kept
away
no
liking
for
such
things
had
they
and
oh
each
had
a
canny
mind
and
could
be
deaf
and
dumb
and
blind
with
words
or
pence
was
neither
free
for
he
was
scotch
and
so
was
she
i
would
not
have
you
think
this
pair
went
on
in
weather
always
fair
for
well
you
know
in
married
life
will
come
sometimes
the
jar
and
strife
they
could
always
just
agree
for
he
was
scotch
and
so
was
she
but
near
of
heart
they
ever
kept
until
at
close
of
life
they
slept
just
this
to
say
when
all
was
past
they
loved
each
other
to
the
last
they
loving
yet
in
heaven
maybe
for
he
was
scotch
and
so
was
she
the
ploughman
friend
mark
these
muscles
mine
a
frame
born
grown
and
fitted
for
the
toil
my
father
tiller
of
the
soil
bequeathed
them
to
me
with
my
name
fear
work
nay
many
times
and
oft
upon
my
brow
the
stands
and
these
two
brown
and
sinewy
hands
methinks
were
never
white
or
soft
i
earn
my
bread
and
know
its
worth
through
days
that
chill
and
days
that
warm
i
wrest
it
with
my
strong
right
arm
from
out
the
bosom
of
the
earth
the
moneyed
man
may
boast
his
wealth
the
boast
his
pedigree
but
greater
far
it
seems
to
me
my
heritage
of
brawn
and
health
my
sinews
strong
my
sturdy
frame
my
independence
free
and
bold
mine
is
the
richest
dower
i
hold
and
ploughman
is
a
noble
name
nor
think
me
all
uncouth
and
rough
for
as
i
turn
the
furrows
far
clearer
than
the
i
see
the
tender
growing
stuff
a
i
the
long
day
through
the
lonely
stretch
of
field
and
wood
seem
pleasant
things
to
me
and
good
the
river
sings
the
heaven
blue
bends
down
so
near
the
hill
thank
god
i
have
the
eyes
to
see
the
beauty
and
the
majesty
of
nature
and
the
heart
to
thrill
at
crimson
sunset
dawn
soft
flush
the
fields
of
gold
that
stretch
afar
the
glimmer
of
the
first
pale
star
that
heralds
in
the
evening
hush
they
lie
who
say
that
labor
makes
a
brute
thing
an
insensate
clod
of
man
the
masterpiece
of
god
they
lie
who
say
that
labor
takes
all
from
us
save
the
lust
of
pelf
dulls
eye
and
ear
and
soul
and
mind
for
no
man
need
be
deaf
or
blind
unless
he
wills
it
so
himself
this
life
i
live
a
goodly
thing
my
soul
keeps
tune
to
one
glad
song
the
while
i
turn
the
furrows
long
a
ploughman
happy
as
a
king
two
monuments
two
men
were
born
the
hour
the
one
was
heir
to
untold
wealth
to
pride
of
birth
and
love
of
power
the
other
heritage
was
health
a
sturdy
frame
an
honest
heart
of
human
sympathy
a
store
a
strength
and
will
to
do
his
part
a
nature
wholesome
to
the
core
the
two
grew
up
to
man
estate
and
took
their
places
in
the
strife
one
found
a
sphere
both
wide
and
great
one
found
the
toil
and
stress
of
life
fate
is
a
partial
jade
i
trow
she
threw
the
rich
man
gold
and
frame
the
laurel
wreath
to
deck
his
brow
high
place
the
multitude
acclaim
the
common
things
the
other
had
the
common
hopes
to
thrill
him
deep
the
common
joys
to
make
him
glad
the
common
griefs
to
make
him
weep
no
high
ambitions
fired
his
breast
the
peace
of
god
the
love
of
friend
of
wife
and
child
these
seemed
the
best
these
held
and
swayed
him
to
the
end
the
two
grew
old
and
death
clear
call
came
to
them
both
the
day
to
him
whose
name
was
known
to
all
to
him
who
walked
his
lowly
way
down
to
his
grave
the
rich
man
went
with
cortege
long
with
pomp
and
pride
him
was
reared
a
monument
that
told
his
virtues
far
and
wide
told
of
his
wealth
his
lineage
high
his
statesmanship
his
trophies
won
how
he
had
filled
the
public
eye
but
empty
praise
when
all
was
done
the
other
found
a
narrow
bed
within
god
acre
peaceful
lone
the
throng
cared
not
that
he
was
dead
a
man
uncultured
and
unknown
but
in
the
house
that
he
had
left
a
woman
whispered
through
her
tears
christ
comfort
me
who
am
bereft
of
love
that
failed
not
through
the
years
and
oft
his
stalwart
sons
and
tall
would
murmur
as
their
eyes
grew
dim
a
useful
life
is
best
of
all
god
grant
we
pattern
after
him
a
sick
man
sighed
i
miss
his
smile
a
shrivelled
crone
did
shake
her
head
and
mutter
to
herself
the
while
how
oft
his
hand
had
given
bread
a
maimed
child
sobbed
he
carried
me
to
gather
blossoms
in
the
wood
and
more
than
one
said
brokenly
a
man
who
always
did
me
good
one
came
at
twilight
to
the
grave
and
knelt
and
kissed
the
sod
oh
faithful
soul
she
cried
and
brave
was
you
that
led
me
back
to
god
back
from
the
sin
the
shame
the
snare
forget
your
trust
and
faith
not
i
each
helpful
word
each
tender
prayer
i
will
remember
till
i
die
two
men
that
sleep
above
the
one
the
monument
an
artist
hand
has
fashioned
from
the
block
of
stone
a
thing
of
beauty
tall
and
grand
above
the
other
naught
what
then
ere
he
did
fold
his
hands
for
rest
he
builded
in
the
hearts
of
men
the
fairest
monument
and
best
the
lonesomest
house
it
the
lonesomest
house
you
ever
saw
this
big
gray
house
where
i
stay
i
do
call
it
living
at
all
at
all
since
my
mother
gone
away
only
four
weeks
now
it
seems
a
year
gone
to
heaven
the
preacher
said
and
my
heart
is
just
broke
awaiting
her
and
my
eyes
are
always
red
i
stay
out
of
doors
till
i
almost
froze
every
identical
room
seems
empty
enough
to
scare
a
boy
and
packed
to
the
door
with
gloom
oh
but
i
hate
to
come
in
to
my
meals
and
her
not
there
in
her
place
pouring
the
tea
and
passing
the
things
with
that
lovin
shine
on
her
face
but
is
worse
i
creep
up
the
stair
and
to
bed
as
still
a
mouse
and
cry
in
my
pillow
it
seems
so
hard
to
stay
in
this
old
gray
house
and
nobody
giving
me
hugs
or
smoothing
my
hair
back
so
things
a
boy
makes
fun
of
before
his
chums
but
things
that
he
likes
you
know
there
no
one
to
go
to
when
things
go
wrong
oh
she
was
so
safe
and
sure
there
was
a
thing
could
tackle
a
boy
that
she
could
up
and
cure
there
lots
of
women
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
missed
so
much
the
women
whose
boys
are
growed
up
and
old
maid
aunties
and
such
i
ca
understand
it
at
all
at
all
why
on
earth
she
should
have
to
go
and
leave
me
here
in
this
old
gray
house
needin
an
wantin
her
so
oh
the
very
lonesomest
thing
of
all
in
the
wide
wide
world
is
a
big
boy
of
twelve
whose
heart
just
broke
his
mother
gone
away
daddy
boy
it
is
time
for
bed
so
the
nurse
declares
but
i
slip
off
to
the
nook
the
cozy
nook
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
where
daddy
reading
his
book
i
want
to
sit
here
awhile
on
your
knee
i
say

little
lad

a
pony
this
year

my
stingy
uncle
joe
after

stall

ready
for
it

on
his
uncle

and
oh
what
a
fuss
for
fear

break
through
the
ice
this
woman
that
keeps
our
house
for
us
she
is
what
i
call
nice
she
wants
a
boy
to
be
just
like
a
girl
to
play
in
the
house
all
day

his
face
all
clean
and
his
hair
in
curl
but

think
that
way
i

a
man

too
big
to

on
your
old
dad

little
toes

the
funniest
shake

stronger
than

laddie
bide

was
the
shrill
voice
of
the

the
deep
voice

him
all
the
day
calling
to
him
in
his
dreams

lad

a
maiden
face
so
smooth
it
was
and
fair
the
laughter
in
his
eyes
of
gray
the
sunshine
in
his
hair
but
a
man
heart
true
and
gallant
beat
beneath
the
tartan
plaid
and
a
strong
right
arm
he
boasted
did
this
bonnie
highland
lad
oh
the
battlefield
is
gruesome
with
its
dying
and
its
dead
but
was
to
the
field
of
battle
that
the
drum
and
bugle
led
magersfontein
and
the
bullets
biting
fiercely
left
and
right
and
the
lad
in
kilt
and
hose
there
in
the
thickest
of
the
fight
fearful
odds
and
none
to
help
them
fight
they
boldly
undismayed
gallant
clansmen
of
the
north
land
brave
old
highlander
brigade
someone
blundered
this
we
know
when
you
met
the
ambushed
foe
but
you
fought
as
heroes
fight
and
died
as
heroes
die
this
we
know
this
we
know
where
the
fighting
had
been
fiercest
as
the
sun
sank
in
the
west
did
they
find
the
widow
laddie
with
a
bullet
in
his
breast
and
his
smiling
face
turned
upward
did
he
dream
at
last
who
knows
of
the
hills
of
scotland
lying
there
in
kilt
and
hose
with
the
gold
hair
gleaming
brightly
underneath
the
bonnet
blue
and
the
tartan
plaid
laid
gently
the
heart
so
brave
and
true
stilled
forever
with
death
coming
did
there
fall
upon
his
ear
music
that
he
loved
to
list
to
bugle
call
so
high
and
clear
thrilling
stirring
sweeter
shriller
and
the
deep
voice
of
the
drum
calling
to
him
through
the
shadows
calling
softly
through
the
shadows
come
lad
come
lad
come
come
come
all
on
an
april
morning
the
teacher
was
wise
and
learned
i
wis
all
nonsense
she
held
in
scorning
but
you
never
can
tell
what
the
primmest
miss
will
do
of
a
bright
spring
morning
what
this
one
did
was
to
spread
a
snare
for
feet
of
a
youth
unheeding
as
march
with
a
meek
and
air
to
its
very
last
hour
was
speeding
oh
he
was
the
dullard
of
his
class
for
how
can
a
youth
get
learning
with
his
eyes
aye
fixed
on
a
pretty
lass
and
his
heart
aye
filled
with
yearning
who
finds
the
rushes
which
fringe
a
pool
she
told
him
the
first
wind
blossom
may
wish
what
he
will
poor
april
fool
with
but
one
wish
in
his
bosom
her
gray
eyes
danced
on
a
chase
he
sally
forth
on
the
morrow
and
later
she
laugh
in
his
sombre
face
and
jest
at
his
words
of
sorrow
but
penitence
and
a
troubled
mind
were
fruits
of
the
night
reflection
after
all
he
was
simple
and
strong
and
kind
was
wrong
to
flout
his
affection
they
met
on
the
hill
as
she
walked
to
school
he
said
unheeding
her
blushes
here
the
early
flower
your
april
fool
found
growing
among
the
rushes
take
it
or
leave
it
as
you
will
his
voice
ringing
out
so
clearly
awoke
in
her
heart
a
happy
thrill
you
know
that
i
love
you
dearly
indulged
as
she
taught
the
school
held
lovers
kneeling
and
suing
take
it
or
leave
it
her
april
fool
was
masterful
in
his
wooing
he
gave
her
the
flower
she
gave
him
a
kiss
his
suit
she
had
long
been
scorning
but
you
never
can
tell
what
the
primmest
miss
will
do
of
a
bright
spring
morning
billy
o
he
was
the
boy
of
the
house
you
know
a
jolly
and
rollicking
lad
he
never
was
sick
he
never
was
tired
and
nothing
could
make
him
sad
if
he
started
to
play
at
sunrise
not
a
rest
would
he
take
at
noon
no
day
was
so
long
from
beginning
to
end
but
his
came
too
soon
did
someone
urge
that
he
make
less
noise
he
would
say
with
a
saucy
grin
why
one
boy
alone
does
make
much
stir
o
sakes
i
wish
i
was
a
twin
there
two
of
twins
and
it
must
be
fun
to
go
double
at
everything
to
holler
by
twos
and
whistle
by
twos
to
stamp
by
twos
and
to
sing
his
laugh
was
something
to
make
you
glad
so
brimful
was
it
of
joy
a
conscience
he
had
perhaps
in
his
breast
but
it
never
troubled
the
boy
you
met
him
out
on
the
garden
path
the
terrier
at
his
heels
and
knew
by
the
shout
he
hailed
you
with
how
happy
a
youngster
feels
the
maiden
auntie
was
half
distraught
with
his
tricks
as
the
days
went
by
the
most
mischievous
child
in
all
the
world
she
said
with
a
shrug
and
a
sigh
his
father
owned
that
her
words
were
true
his
mother
declared
each
day
he
was
putting
wrinkles
into
her
face
and
turning
her
brown
hair
gray
his
sister
referred
to
him
as
a
trouble
a
trial
a
grief
the
way
he
ignored
all
rules
she
said
was
something
beyond
belief
it
never
troubled
the
boy
of
the
house
he
revelled
in
racket
and
din
had
only
one
regret
in
the
world
he
had
been
born
a
twin
there
nobody
making
a
noise
there
nobody
stamping
the
floor
is
strangely
silent
upstairs
and
down
white
ribbons
upon
the
door
the
terrier
whining
out
in
the
sun
where
my
comrade
he
seems
to
say
turn
your
plaintive
eyes
away
little
dog
there
no
frolic
for
you
the
girl
from
the
house
next
door
is
sobbing
her
young
heart
out
do
cry
little
girl
you
soon
forget
the
laugh
and
the
merry
shout
the
sister
is
kissing
his
face
and
calling
him
angel
and
sweet
and
the
maiden
aunt
is
nursing
the
boots
he
wore
on
his
restless
feet
so
big
so
solemn
the
old
house
seems
no
uproar
no
racket
no
din
no
shrill
peal
of
laughter
no
voice
shrieking
out
o
sakes
i
wish
i
was
a
twin
a
man
and
a
woman
white
with
grief
watch
the
wearisome
moments
creep
oh
the
loneliness
touches
everything
the
boy
of
the
house
is
asleep
sly
boy
i
was
the
slyest
boy
at
home
the
slyest
boy
at
school
i
wanted
all
the
world
to
know
that
i
was
no
one
fool
i
kept
my
childish
hopes
and
schemes
locked
closely
in
my
breast
no
single
secret
shared
with
bob
the
chum
i
liked
the
best
i
never
showed
my
squirrel
nest
nor
beaver
dam
nor
cave
nor
fortress
where
i
used
to
go
to
be
a
soldier
brave
oh
i
was
sly
just
awful
sly
in
winter
summer
spring
while
bob
would
tell
me
all
he
knew
i
never
told
a
thing
and
yet
bob
always
got
ahead
i
find
the
careless
knave
asleep
within
my
fortress
walls
and
fishing
in
my
cave
what
yours
he
said
in
great
surprise
you
should
have
told
me
so
you
never
said
a
word
old
chum
and
how
was
i
to
know
my
slyness
hurt
more
than
it
helped
if
bob
had
known
you
see
he
was
too
kind
to
do
his
best
to
get
ahead
of
me
i
still
was
sly
when
i
grew
up
i
fell
in
love
with
nan
but
scorned
to
own
it
to
myself
or
any
other
man
so
sly
was
i
nan
never
guessed
no
more
did
handsome
bob
that
every
time
she
looked
my
way
my
heart
it
stirred
and
throbbed
the
same
old
story
ere
i
knew
my
chum
had
loved
and
won
when
i
explained
i
picked
her
out
to
be
my
very
own
what
yours
he
said
in
great
surprise
you
should
have
told
me
so
you
never
said
a
word
old
chum
and
how
was
i
to
know
i
learned
my
lesson
lost
my
girl
you
own
is
rather
rough
henceforward
i
not
be
too
sly
i
be
just
sly
enough

we
dreamed
in
youth
to
hold
the

shed

that
lies

hosannas
ring
as
harpers
strike
their

of
gold
and
glory
glory
sing
upon
the
city
threshold
fair
a
woman
steps
and
lingers
there
the
eyes
she
turns
on
peter
face
with
unshed
tears
are
dim
tell
christ
she
says
a
mother
waits
who
fain
would
speak
with
him
through
all
the
music
far
above
the
highest
grandest
note
of
triumph
and
of
joy
and
praise
her
soft
voice
seems
to
float
and
hearing
it
straight
from
his
throne
comes
down
to
her
the
kingly
one
with
shining
face
and
eyes
that
hold
such
wealth
of
love
and
peace
she
feels
her
trembling
heart
grow
bold
her
doubt
and
grieving
cease
dear
lord
she
cries
and
lowly
kneels
i
have
a
prayer
to
make
o
do
thou
hear
and
answer
it
for
thine
own
mercy
sake
since
heaven
will
not
seem
fair
to
me
if
one
dear
face
i
may
not
see
dear
christ
a
mother
love
is
great
to
shield
to
guide
to
watch
to
wait
the
last
kiss
that
i
gave
on
earth
was
to
my
wayward
son
whose
soul
though
deeply
stainèd
by
sin
may
yet
by
love
be
won
to
penitence
to
higher
walk
to
purer
holier
way
o
wilt
thou
let
me
to
go
to
him
and
guard
him
night
and
day
thou
wert
a
babe
in
bethlehem
a
mother
guarded
thee
i
pray
thee
now
for
her
dear
sake
to
hearken
unto
me
remember
how
she
held
thee
close
and
crooned
thee
sweet
and
low
the
lullabies
that
mothers
sang
long
centuries
ago
and
bared
her
snowy
breast
to
thee
and
stroked
thy
forehead
tenderly
and
kissed
thee
oft
and
told
herself
again
and
yet
again
to
hold
thee
thus
one
hour
outweighed
the
travail
and
the
pain
dear
christ
this
city
is
most
fair
its
glories
thrill
and
move
o
doth
it
grieve
thee
that
my
heart
cleaves
to
an
earthly
love
that
on
mine
eyes
heaven
beauties
dim
because
my
heart
is
back
with
him
with
him
the
wandering
son
of
mine
the
wayward
one
whose
need
of
patient
love
and
guiding
hand
is
very
great
indeed
think
not
i
love
thee
not
dear
lord
nor
long
for
heaven
rest
is
only
that
the
throbs
fiercely
in
my
breast
on
this
glad
morning
of
thy
birth
o
grant
me
leave
to
visit
earth
lo
on
her
head
she
feels
the
touch
of
tender
wounded
hand
fear
not
she
hears
a
love
like
thine
the
christ
can
understand
no
mother
prays
in
vain
to
me
on
this
day
of
the
year
for
when
the
faltering
words
she
speaks
fall
on
my
waiting
ear
i
do
remember
that
my
cheek
lay
on
a
bosom
warm
i
do
remember
bethlehem
and
mary
cradling
arm
love
lesson
one
lesson
let
us
bear
in
mind
be
very
gentle
with
our
own
be
to
their
faults
a
little
blind
nor
wound
them
by
a
look
or
tone
put
self
behind
turn
tender
eyes
keep
back
the
words
that
hurt
and
sting
we
learn
when
sorrow
makes
us
wise
forbearance
is
the
grandest
thing
be
patient
lest
some
day
we
turn
our
eyes
on
loved
one
fast
asleep
and
whisper
as
we
lean
and
yearn
how
often
i
have
made
you
weep
some
loved
you
not
and
words
let
fall
that
must
have
piercèd
your
gentle
breast
but
i
who
loved
you
best
of
all
hurt
you
far
more
than
all
the
rest
one
lesson
let
us
keep
in
mind
to
hold
our
dear
ones
close
and
fast
since
loyal
hearts
are
hard
to
find
and
life
and
love
so
soon
are
past
immortality

blew
harsh
and
chill
the
lily
lifting
up
its
breath
where
snowdrifts
spread
but
yesterday
all
cry
where
is
thy
sting
o
death
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
each
eastertide
the
old
world
sings
her
anthem
sweet
and
true
and
strong
and
all
the
tender
growing
things
join
in
her
resurrection

close

trails

the

the

the

spring
with
the

at

pansies
abloom
in
her

spring
with
enough
of

in
herself
to
make
the
dead
to
arise
for
see
as
she
bends
the
coffin
deep
the
frozen
valley

the
dead
river
stirs
ah
that
kiss
is
making
its
heart
to
thrill
and
then
as
she
closer
and
closer
leans
it
slips
from
its
snowy
shroud
frightened
a
moment
then
rushing
away
calling
and
laughing
aloud
the
hill
where
she
rested
is
all
abloom
the
wood
is
green
as
of
old
and
wakened
birds
are
striving
to
send
their
songs

the
gates

madam
they
say

tell
me
has
she
passed
thither
let
her
alone
and
she
come
home
and
bring
her
all
with
her
the
splendor
of
the
days
sweet
and
shrill
the
crickets
hiding
in
the

brown

their

sweeter
shriller
one
would
think
the
world
was
green
o
the
haze

on
the
hilltops
and
the
haze
is
on
the
lake
see
it
fleeing
through
the
valley
with
the
bold
wind
in
its
wake
mark
the
warm
october
haze
mark
the
splendor
of
the
days
and
the
mingling
of
the
crimson
with
the
sombre
brown
and
grays
see
the
bare
hills
turn
their
furrows
to
the
shine
and
to
the
glow
if
you
listen
you
can
hear
it
hear
a
murmur
soft
and
low
we
are
naked
so
the
fields
say
stripped
of
all
our
golden
dress
heed
it
not
october
answers
for
i
love
ye
none
the
less
share
my
beauty
and
my
cheer
while
we
rest
together
here
in
these
days
of
languor
in
these
late
days
of
the

all
the

of
the
summer
all
the
springtime

and

all
the
riches
of
the

crown
her

and

her
face
and
the
wind
goes
sighing
sighing
as
if
loath
to
let
her
pass
while
the
crickets
sing
exultant
in
the
lean
and
withered
grass
o
the
warm
october
haze
o
the
splendor
of

days
o
the
mingling
of

crimson
with

sombre
brown

warmth
is
she
o
glad
sun
creeping
through
the
casement
wide
a
million
blossoms
have
you
kissed
since
morn
but
none
so
fair
as
this
one
at
my
side
touch
soft
the
bit
of
love
the
babe
new
born
towards
all
the
world
my
love
and
pity
flow
with
high
resolves
with
trust
with
sympathy
this
happy
heart
of
mine
is
all
aglow
this
heart
that
was
so
cold
god
warmth
is
she
her
prayer
low
in
the
church
she
kneeled
the
sunshine
falling
on
her
golden
hair
the
moaning
of
a
soul
with
hurt
unhealed
was
her
and
broken
cry
of
prayer
thy
wounded
hand
dear
christ
thy
wounded
hand
i
pray
thee
lay
it
on
this
heart
of
mine
this
heart
so
sick
with
grief
it
can
not
stand
aught
heavier
than
this
tender
touch
of
thine
thy
wounded
hand
dear
christ
o
let
it
press
here
where
the
hurt
is
hardest
where
the
pain
throbs
fiercest
and
the
utter
emptiness
mocks
at
glad
memories
and
longings
vain
thy
wounded
hand
dear
christ
who
long
ago
slept
by
thy
mother
side
in
bethlehem
think
of
her
cradling
arms
her
low
and
pity
me
when
thou
dost
think
of
them
my
baby
girl
my
pretty
dear
i
miss
morning
and
noon
and
night
her
ways
so
wise
the
patting
of
her
soft
warm
hands
the
kiss
the
cooing
voice
the
sunshine
of
her
eyes
i
sleep
and
dream
she
nestles
close
my
own
her
red
mouth
on
my
breast
i
wake
and
cry
she
sleeps
out
yonder
in
the
dark
alone
my
arms
are
empty
and
my
bosom
dry
thy
wounded
hand
dear
christ
will
surely
bring
healing
for
this
great
anguish
that
i
bear
a
nursing
babe
a
little
dimpled
thing
god
might
have
left
her
to
her
mother
care
thy
wounded
hand
dear
christ
o
let
me
feel
its
touch
and
past
all
doubting
prove
thou
hast
not
lost
thine
ancient
power
to
heal
press
out
the
bitterness
fill
up
with
love
o
babe
that
in
the
manger
rude
did
sleep
o
prince
of
peace
thy
tender
wounded
palm
still
holds
the
oil
of
joy
for
those
that
weep
still
holds
the
comforting
the
gilead
balm
decorating
the
old
church
gray
old

what
do
you
bring
laurel
and
ivy
and
bay
with

for
the
crowning
of
a

the
morrow
is
christmas

holly
with
thorns
and
berries
like
blood
on
its
shiny
greenness
flung
o
the
piercèd
side
and
the
thorny
crown
and
the
cross
whereon
he
hung
the
mistletoe
meaning
hangs
close
to
the
holly

lest
we
forget
that
on
christmas
day
the
healer
of
souls
was
born
ivy
for
faith
on
the
altar
rail
let
it
creep
where
all
may
see
it
crept
till
it
kissed
a
cheek
so
pale
that
night
in
gethsemane
bay
for
remembrance
full
and
sweet
it
speaks
with
its
fragrant
breath
of
manger
and
cross
and
a
lowly
tomb
and
a
love
that
conquered
death
and
laurel
leaves
for
the
wreath
i
bring
the
laurel
for
victory
and
palms
for
the

the

day
envy
when
satan
sends
to
vex
the
mind
of
man
and
urge
him
on
to
meanness
and
to
wrong
his
satellites
there
is
not
one
that
can
acquit
itself
like
envy
not
so
strong
as
lust
so
quick
as
fear
so
big
as
hate
a
pigmy
thing
the
twin
of
sordid
greed
its
work
all
noble
things
to
underrate
decry
fair
face
fair
form
fair
thought
fair
deed
a
sneer
it
has
for
what
is
highest
best
for
love
soft
voice
and
virtue
robe
of
white
truth
is
not
true
and
pity
is
not
kind
a
great
task
done
is
but
a
pastime
light
tormented
and
tormenting
is
the
mind
that
grants
to
envy
room
to
make
its
nest
the
song
of
the
bells
he
frowned
and
shook
his
snowy
head
those
clanging
bells
they
deafen
quite
with
their
unmeaning
song
he
said
i
weary
of
it
all
the
gladness
sadness
i
so
old
i
have
no
sympathy
to
spare
my
heart
has
grown
so
hard
and
cold
so
full
of
self
i
do
not
care
how
many
laugh
or
long
or
grieve
in
all
the
world
this
christmas
eve
there
was
a
time
long
long
ago
they
take
our
best
the
passing
years
for
the
old
life
and
faith
and
glow
i
give
what
on
my
cheek
not
tears
i
have
a
whim
i
spend
till
eyes
turn
on
me
gratefully
an
old
man
whim
just
to
pretend
that
he
is
what
he
used
to
be
for
this
one
night
not
want
nor
pain
shall
look
to
me
for
help
in
vain
a
foolish
whim
he
muttered
oft
the
while
he
gave
to
those
in
need
but
strangely
warm
and
strangely
soft
his
old
face
grew
for
self
and
greed
slipped
from
him
ah
it
made
him
glow
to
hear
the
blessing
thanks
the
prayer
he
looked
into
his
heart
and
lo
the
faith
and
love
were
there
ring
out
old
bells
right
gladly
ring
he
said
full
sweet
the
song
you
sing

with
a
golden

stretching

methinks
within

a
maiden

pink
and
the
white
of
your
face
is
to
me
a
rare
thing
of
delight
but
not
for
this
do
i
love
you
that
agoo
on
your
lips
is
the
tenderest
thing
and
the
eyes
smiling
at
me
ye
bonnie
wee
thing
are
violets
washed
with
the
dewdrops
of
spring
but
not
for
this
do
i
love
you
come
nestle
down
close
on
my
bosom
you

secret
i
whisper
right
into
your
ear
because
you
are

i
love
you
because
you
are
you
just
you
oh
my
own
because
you
are
lesley

darling
until
you

grown
because
you

do
i
love
you
the
tryst
the
harvest
moon
in
yellow
haze
is
steeping
all
the
sea
and
land
is
kindling
paths
and
shining
ways
around
the
hills
across
the
sand
and
there
are
only
thou
and
i
o
sweetheart
i
no
eyes
to
note
the
glory
of
the
sea
and
sky
i
see
a
softly
rounded
throat
a
face
uplifted
pure
and
sweet
two
blue
eyes
filled
with
trust
and
love
enough
the
sea
sings
at
our
feet
the
harvest
moon
sails
just
above
a
good
woman
her
eyes
are
the
windows
of
a
soul
where
only
the
white
thoughts
spring
and
they
look
as
the
eyes
of
the
angels
look
for
the
good
in
everything
her
lips
can
whisper
the
tenderest
words
that
weary
and
worn
can
hear
can
tell
of
the
dawn
of
a
better
morn
till
only
the
cowards
fear
her
hands
can
lift
up
the
fallen
one
from
an
overthrow
complete
can
take
a
soul
from
the
mire
of
sin
and
lead
it
to
christ
dear
feet
and
she
can
walk
wherever
she
will
she
walketh
never
alone
the
work
she
does
is
the
master
work
and
god
guards
well
his
own
despair
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
it
gaunt
and
gray
when
the
golden
sunbeams
are
all
abroad
we
sober
a
moment
then
softly
say
the
world
still
lies
in
the
hand
of
god
we
watch
it
stealthily
creeping
the
threshold
leading
to
somebody
soul
a
shadow
we
cry
it
can
not
be
more
when
faith
is
one
portion
and
heaven
one
goal
a
ghost
that
comes
stealing
its
way
along
affrighting
the
weak
with
its
gruesome
air
but
who
that
is
young
and
glad
and
strong
fears
for
a
moment
to
meet
despair
to
this
heart
of
ours
we
have
thought
so
bold
all
uninvited
it
comes
one
day
lo
faith
grows
wan
and
love
grows
cold
and
the
heaven
of
our
dreams
lies
far
away
our
dead

south
africa
day
of
battle
and
day
of
blood

canada
sons
the
land
that
bore
you
will
not
forget
the
barley
fields
the
sunset
has
faded
there
but
a
tinge
saffron
pale
where
a
star
of
white
has
tangled
itself
in
the
trailing
fringe
of
the
robe
of
the
summer
night
o
the
green
of
the
barley
fields
grows
deep
the
breath
of
the
barley
fields
grows
rare
there
is
rustle
and
glimmer
sway
and
sweep
the
wind
is
holding
high
revel
there
singing
the
song
it
has
often
sung
hark
to
the
troubadour
glad
and
bold
sweet
is
the
earth
when
the
summer
is
young
and
the
barley
fields
are
green
and
gold
the
imprisoned
lark
did
you
send
your
song
to
the
gates
of
gold
in
the
days
of
long
ago
a
song
of
sweetness
and
gladness
untold
till
fain
was
my
lady
to
have
and
to
hold
ah
my
lady
did
not
know
is
love
and
joy
make
the
soul
of
a
song
if
we
only
understood
can
each
strain
be
tender
and
true
and
strong
when
the
days
stretch
out
so
weary
and
long
dear
little
bird
of
the
wood
the
sun
came
so
boldly
into
your
cell
is
the
springtime
pretty
bird
and
full
sweet
the
story
he
had
to
tell
of
doings
in
meadow
and
wood
and
dell
till
your
longing
grew
and
stirred
this
cage
of
my
lady
has
silver
bars
and
my
lady
voice
is
mild
but
oh
to
sail
the
earth
and
stars
forget
the
hurt
of
the
prison
bars
in
the
gladness
of
freedom
wild
to
soar
and
circle
shadowy
glade
where
dewdrops
hide
from
the
sun
o
fields
where
the
blossoming
clover
swayed
o
voices
familiar
that
music
made
till
the
full
glad
day
was
done
ah
then
you
sang
little
bird
of
the
wood
and
you
stilled
the
laughing
throng
to
make
passionate
longing
understood
you
took
the
height
and
depth
of
your
mood
and
flung
them
into
a
song
these
guests
of
my
lady
did
listen
i
know
when
out
through
the
silver
bars
you
sent
forth
a
measure
liquid
and
low
as
laughter
of
waters
that
ebb
and
flow
under
the
shimmering
stars
you
sang
of
the
sweetest
gladdest
and
best
your
longing
heart
held
in
store
till
into
the
careless
listener
breast
there
flashed
a
sudden
and
vague
unrest
that
grew
into
something
more
eyes
saw
for
a
few
brief
moments
space
the
heights
that
were
never
trod
and
seeing
grew
dim
for
the
swift
bold
race
that
was
planned
in
the
hours
when
youth
and
grace
came
fresh
from
the
hand
of
god
only
a
homesick
bird
of
the
field
trilling
a
glorious
note
only
a
homesick
bird
of
the
wood
with
heaven
in
your
full
throat
woman
not
faultless
for
she
was
not
fashioned
so
a
mingling
of
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
lips
that
can
laugh
and
sigh
and
whisper
low
of
hope
and
trust
and
happiness
complete
or
speak
harsh
truths
eyes
that
can
flash
with
fire
or
make
themselves
but
wells
of
tenderness
wherein
is
drowned
all
bitterness
and
ire
warm
eyes
whose
lightest
glance
is
a
caress
heaven
sent
her
here
to
brighten
this
old
earth
and
only
heaven
fully
knows
her
worth
the
mullein
meadow
down
in
the
mullein
meadow
the
lusty
thistle
springs
the
butterflies
go
the
lonesome
catbird
sings
the
alderbush
is
flaunting
her
blossoms
white
as
snow
the
same
old
mullein
meadow
we
played
in
long
ago
the
waste
land
of
the
homestead
the
arid
sandy
spot
where
reaper
song
is
never
heard
where
wealth
is
never
sought
but
where
the
sunshine
lingers
and
merry
breezes
come
to
gather
pungent
perfumes
from
the
abloom
there
a
playground
on
the
hillside
a
playhouse
in
the
glade
with
mulleins
for
a
garden
and
mulleins
for
a
shade
and
still
the
farmer
grumbles
that
nothing
good
will
grow
in
this
old
mullein
meadow
we
played
in
long
ago
living
freshness
o
freshness
living
freshness
of
a
day
in
june
spring
scarce
has
gotten
out
of
sight
and
not
a
stain
of
wear
shows
on
the
grass
beneath
our
feet
and
not
a
dead
leaf
calls
our
day
of
loveliness
is
past
and
gone
i
found
the
thick
wood
steeped
in
pleasant
smells
the
dainty
ferns
hid
in
their
sheltered
nooks
the
found
the
sunlight
where
they
stood
and
some
hid
their
white
faces
quite
away
while
others
lifted
up
their
starry
eyes
and
seemed
right
glad
to
ruffle
in
the
breeze
life
day
life
day
is
too
brief
he
said
at
dawn
i
would
it
were
ten
times
longer
for
great
tasks
wait
for
me
further
on
at
noonday
the
wish
was
stronger
his
place
was
in
the
thick
of
the
strife
and
hopes
were
nearing
completeness
while
one
was
crowning
the
joys
of
life
with
love
own
wonderful
sweetness
life
day
is
too
brief
for
all
it
contains
the
triumphs
the
fighting
the
proving
the
hopes
and
desires
the
joys
and
the
pains
too
brief
for
the
hating
and
loving
he
sits
in
the
shadows
gray
while
heavily
sorrow
presses
o
the
long
long
day
o
the
weary
day
with
its
failures
and
successes
he
sits
in
the
shadows
and
turns
his
eyes
on
the
years
that
lie
behind
him
i
am
tired
of
all
things
now
he
cries
and
the
hot
tears
rise
and
blind
him
rest
and
stillness
is
all
that
i
crave
such
robbing
of
strength
has
grief
done
make
room
dear
love
in
your
lowly
grave
life
day
thank
god
is
a
brief
one
morning
the
eastern
sky
grew
all
aglow
a
tinted
fleet
sailed
just
below
the
thick
wood
and
the
clinging
mist
slow
parted
wept
and
kissed
to
primrose
tulip
daffodil
the
wind
came
piping
gay
and
shrill
wake
up
wake
up
while
day
is
new
and
all
the
world
is
washed
with
dew
grace
june
so
still
you
sleep
upon
your
bed
so
motionless
and
slender
it
can
not
be
that
you
are
dead
my
maiden
gay
and
tender
you
were
no
creature
pale
and
meek
that
death
should
hasten
after
the
dimples
played
within
your
cheek
your
lips
were
made
for
laughter
to
you
the
great
world
was
a
place
that
care
might
never
stay
in
a
playground
built
by
god
good
grace
for
glad
young
folks
to
play
in
you
made
your
footpath
by
life
flowers
o
happy
maiden
the
sky
was
full
of
shine
and
showers
the
wind
was
perfume
laden
your
dimpled
hands
are
folded
now
upon
your
snowy
bosom
the
dark
hair
nestles
on
your
brow
o
tender
broken
blossom
the
white
lids
hide
your
eyes
so
clear
so
mirthful
so
beguiling
but
as
my
tears
fall
on
you
dear
your
lips
seem
softly
smiling
and
do
you
feel
that
it
is
home
the
city
far
above
us
and
were
they
glad
to
have
you
come
and
will
you
cease
to
love
us
methinks
when
you
stand
all
in
white
to
learn
each
sweet
new
duty
some
eye
will
note
with
keen
delight
your
radiance
and
beauty
and
when
your
laughter
softly
rings
out
where
god
streets
do
glisten
the
angels
fair
will
fold
their
wings
and
still
their
song
to
listen
the
way
to
dreamland
with
an
angel
every
day
a
dimpled
maiden
sails
away
from
off
my
bosom
on
a
radiant
sea
of
bliss
i
can
see
her
drifting
drifting
hear
the
snowy
wings
uplifting
as
he
woos
her
into
dreamland
with
a
kiss
blissful
hour
my
pretty
sleeper
guarded
by
an
angel
keeper
to
the
words
he
brings
thee
from
a
fairer
world
than
this
sweet
thy
heart
he
is
beguiling
i
can
tell
it
by
thy
smiling
as
he
woos
thee
into
dreamland
with
a
kiss
could
there
come
to
weary
mortals
such
a
glimpse
through
golden
portals
would
we
not
drift
on
forever
toward
the
land
of
peace
jean
would
we
not
leave
joys
and
sorrows
glad
and
sad
for
the
sound
of
white
wings
lifting
and
the
kiss
her
mission
she
is
so
winsome
and
so
wise
she
sways
me
at
her
will
and
oft
the
question
will
arise
what
mission
does
she
fill
o
then
i
say
with
pride
untold
and
love
beyond
degree
this
woman
with
the
heart
of
gold
she
just
keeps
house
for
me
for
me
she
just
keeps
house
for
me
a
full
content
dwells
on
her
face
she
quite
in
love
with
life
and
for
a
title
wears
with
grace
the
sweet
wife
our
children
climb
upon
her
knee
and
nestle
on
her
breast
and
ah
her
mission
seems
to
me
the
grandest
and
the
best
o
then
i
say
with
pride
untold
and
love
beyond
degree
this
woman
with
the
heart
of
gold
she
just
keeps
house
for
me
for

press
his
foul
lips
to
the
pity
of
it
liar
yet
half
believed
by
such
as

good
or

but
the
outcome
of
a
mood
that
one
who
with
the
breath
lent
him
by
heaven
speaks
words
that
on
some
white
soul
do
reflect

the
work
we
are
ashamed
to
do
archibald
lampman
by
the
grace
of
you
sing
of
winter
gray
and
chill
of
silent
stream
and
frozen
lake
of
naked
woods
and
winds
that
wake
to
shriek
and
sob
vale
and
hill
and
straight
we
breathe
the
bracing
air
and
see
stretched
out
before
our
eyes
a
white
world
spanned
by
brooding
skies
and
snowflakes
drifting
everywhere
you
sing
of
tender
things
and
sweet
of
field
of
brook
of
flower
of
bush
the
lilt
of
bird
the
sunset
flush
the
scarlet
poppies
in
the
wheat
until
we
feel
the
gleam
and
glow
of
summer
pulsing
through
our
veins
and
hear
the
patter
of
the
rains
and
watch
the
green
things
sprout
and
grow
you
sing
of
joy
and
we
do
mark
how
glad
a
thing
is
life
and
dear
of
sorrow
and
we
seem
to
hear
the
sound
of
sobbing
in
the
dark
the
subtle
power
to
sway
and
move
the
stamp
of
genius
strong
and
true
this
friend
was
heaven
gift
to
you
this
made
you
great
and
won
you
love
your
song
goes
ringing
clear
and
sweet
though
on
earth
bosom
bare
and
brown
all
willingly
you
laid
you
down
the
music
is
not
incomplete
sleep
on
it
is
not
by
the
years
we
measure
life
when
all
is
done
your
rest
is
earned
your
laurels
won
sleep
softly
sleep
we
say
with
tears
a
hint
among
the
vivid
green
i
see
a
yellow
leaf
and
yonder
in
the
basswood
tree
an
empty
nest
swings
lonesomely
the
wheat
in
sheaf
chrysanthemum
court
they
lift
their
faces
to
the
light
and
aye
they
are
a
gallant
band
the
queen
of
all
is
snowy
white
a
stately
thing
and
tall
and
grand
see
close
beside
in
yellow
drest
is
the
prince
consort
of
the
hour
a
bit
of
god
own
sunshine
prest
into
a
glorious
golden
flower
and
mark
the
courtiers
noble

gay
courtiers
these
in
raiment
fine
their
satin
doublets
slashed
with
lace
their
velvet
cloaks
as
red
as
wine
each
is
most
fair
note
well
the
graces
she
unfurls
the
winds
have
tossed
her
fluffy
hair
and
left
it
in
a
thousand
curls
and
yonder
quaint
one
arrayed
in
palest
lavender
ah
few
there
are
when
all
is
done
in
beauty
can
compare
with
her
the
pink
i
seen
at
eventide
a
something
very
like
to
this
a
cloud
adrift
upon
the
sky
all
rosy
from
the
sun
last
kiss
without
the
court
the
chill
and
gloom
of
autumn
twilight
the
land
within
the
grandeur
and
the
bloom
of
queen
of
prince
and
courtiers
grand
her
little
way
is
woman
rules
the
whole
world
still
though
faults
the
critics
say
she
has
she
smiles
her
smile
and
works
her
will
is
just
a
little
way
she
has
the
criticism
the
great
man
came
to
the
country
place
to
preach
to
farmers
sturdy
he
said
i
in
my
happiest
vein
i
be
eloquent
and
wordy
not
often
a
great
man
like
myself
comes
here
to
do
the
teaching
a
big
event
in
these
quiet
lives
they
not
forget
my
preaching
the
great
man
found
him
a
text
at
length
in
ezekiel
ponderous
pages
from
point
to
point
of
his
sermon
long
he
travelled
at
easy
stages
he
soared
up
high
in
the
realms
of
thought
was
rich
in
allegory
i
have
said
he
as
he
sat
him
down
covered
myself
with
glory
these
simple
rustics
are
overcome
with
my
rhetoric
and
power
they
used
to
a
sprinkling
of
thought
and
i
given
them
a
shower
the
great
man
got
a
terrible
shock
as
the
long
service
over
he
walked
with
a
farmer
grave
and
staid
home
through
the
fields
of
clover
your
people
ah
were
they
much
impressed
with
my
sermon
he
queried
preaching
with
earnestness
power
and
force
has
left
me
sadly
wearied
a
worse
would
a
done
us
country
folks
the
farmer
tone
a
terse
one
that
is
reflectively
if
you
happened
to
have
a
worse
one
jessie
you
miss
the
touch
of
her
dear
hand
her
laughter
gay
and
sweet
the
dimpled
cheek
the
sunny
smile
the
patter
of
her
feet
the
loving
glances
she
bestowed
the
tender
tales
she
told
the
world
since
she
has
gone
away
seems
empty
drear
and
cold
dear
oft
you
prayed
that
god
would
give
your
darling
joy
and
grace
that
pain
or
loss
might
never
dim
the
brightness
of
her
face
that
her
young
heart
might
keep
its
trust
its
purity
so
white
its
wealth
of
sweet
unselfishness
her
eyes
their
radiant
light
her
fair
soft
face
its
innocence
of
every
guile
and
wrong
and
nothing
touch
to
mar
the
joy
and
gladness
of
her
song
god
heard
the
prayer
his
answer
came
now
cease
thy
murmuring
cease
come
little
one
come
home
he
said
unto
the
land
of
peace
you
sheltered
her
upon
your
breast
the
child
so
quaint
and
wise
where
sorrow
is
unknown
she
walks
in
paradise
her
eyes
have
learned
the
mystery
her
feet
the
vale
have
crost
but
friend
of
mine
you
find
again
the
treasure
you
have
lost
your
arms
will
surely
clasp
once
more
the
little
girl
who
waits
for
you
within
the
gates
of
jasper
and
of
pearl
poynings
do
you
remember
that
june
day
among
the
hills
the
high
sussex
hills
above
the
straggling
flocks
of
fleecy
clouds
that
skipped
and
chased
each
other
merrily
in
god
warm
pasturage
the
azure
sky
below
the
hills
that
stretched
their
mighty
heads
as
though
they
fain
would
neighbor
with
that
sky
deep
vivid
green
save
where
the
flocks
showed
white
the
wise
ewes
hiding
from
the
glow
of
noon
in
shady
spots
the
lambs
at
play
and
over
all
the
stillness
of
the
hills
the
sweet
and
solemn
stillness
of
the
hills
the
shepherds
gave
us
just
such
looks
of
mild
surprise
as
did
the
sheep
they
shepherded
ye
are
not
of
the
hills
so
said
the
looks
not
of
our
kind
but
strangers
come
from
out
the
busy
bustling
world
to
taste
the
sweets
of
silence
and
of
peace
we
wish
you
well
in
eager
quest
of
what
the
hills
might
hide
some
valley
of
content
some
spring
of
youth
some
deep
enchanted
dell
filled
to
the
brim
with
subtle
mysteries
allurement
rare
we
followed
down
a
path
a
little
crooked
path
that
lost
itself
and
found
itself
so
oft
we
knew
it
for
the
playmate
of
the
stream
that
went
with
us
and
sang
a
clamorous
song
a
song
of
flock
and
fold
of
and
of
sun
until
at
length
we
came
into
a
valley
warm
and
wide
a
cradle
the
hills
in
it
there
lay
no
infant
hamlet
but
one
gray
and
old
that
dozed
and
dreamed
the
soft
june
hours
away
gardens
there
were
with
fragrant
filled
and
daffodils
and
rhododendrons
pale
and
sweet
pinks
phlox
rosemary
an
avenue
of
elms
with
cottages
and
barefoot
children
sporting
on
the
green
is
poynings
said
the
rustic
see
the
church
lies
yonder
and
the
graveyard
just
beyond
this
path
will
lead
you
straight
to
it
do
you
remember
rather
will
you
forget
that
gray
church
built
how
many
centuries
ago
the
worn
stone
steps
the
oaken
door
the
crumbling
walls
the
altar
carved
the
stories
told
by
windows
set
deep
in
the
walls
the
ivy
thick
and
green
which
crept
and
hid
the
grayness
quite
from
sight
within
the
smell
of
roses
from
the
sheaf
of
scarlet
bloom
before
the
altar
laid
close
mingled
with
the
mould
and
must
of
age
on
wall
and
floor
memorials
to
the
dead
who
unafraid
had
slumbered
there
so
long
and
then
the
graveyard
out
among
the
trees
no
graveyard
but
a
garden
flower
filled
moss
roses
white
as
moth
wings
in
the
night
and
lilies
sorrowful
but
very
sweet
violets
in
grasses
hid
and
rue
which
spoke
of
some
heart
bitterness
old
time
had
decked
the
stones
with
lichens
rare
rubbed
out
with
careless
hand
the
lettering
in
memory
of
someone
life
and
love
each
stood
but
whose
we
might
not
know
and
while
we
lingered
in
the
perfumed
gloom
and
watched
the
golden
sunshine
smite
the
hills
an
english
blackbird
straight
began
a
song
so
sweet
so
high
so
shrill
so
wondrous
clear
that
listening
our
eyes
grew
dim
the
while
our
hearts
did
thrill
has
heard
the
song
an
english
blackbird
carols
forth
in
june
knows
well
the
power
it
has
the
wondrous
charm
strangers
were
we
within
the
gates
and
so
he
gave
us
welcome
clearer
warmer
still
a
welcome
to
the
beauty
and
the
bloom
the
silence
of
the
churchyard
old
and
gray
a
welcome
to
the
grasses
and
the
brook
the
shade
of
feathery
elm
trees
and
the
glow
of
sunlight
quivering
golden
on
the
sward
a
welcome
to
the
valley
dim
and
to
the
hills
the
high
sussex
hills
song
of
the
golden
sea
sing
ye
ripening
fields
of
wheat
sing
to
the
breezes
passing
by
sing
your
jubilant
song
and
sweet
sing
to
the
earth
the
air
the
sky
earth
that
held
thee
and
skies
that
kissed
morning
and
noon
and
night
for
long
sun
and
rain
and
dew
and
mist
all
that
has
made
you
glad
and
strong
the
harvest
fields
of
the
far
far
west
stretch
out
a
shimmering
sea
of
gold
every
ripple
upon
its
breast
sings
peace
and
plenty
and
wealth
untold
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
it
goes
farther
yet
there
seems
no
end
under
a
sky
where
blue
and
rose
with
the
gold
and
turquoise
softly
blend
here
where
sweep
the
prairies
lone
broad
and
beautiful
in
god
eyes
here
in
this
young
land
all
our
own
the
of
the
old
world
lies
dawn
i
can
not
echo
the
old
wish
to
die
at
morn
as
darkness
strays
we
have
been
glad
together
greeting
some
radiant
days
the
earth
would
hold
me
every
day
familiar
things
would
weigh
me
fast
the
stir
the
touch
of
morn
the
bird
that
on
swift
wings
goes
flitting
past
some
flower
would
lift
to
me
its
tender
face
and
send
its
breath
to
whisper
of
the
earth
its
beauty
and
its
grace
and
combat
death
it
would
be
light
and
i
would
see
in
thy
dear
eyes
the
sorrow
grow
love
could
i
lift
my
own
undimmed
to
paradise
and
leave
thee
so
a
thousand
cords
would
hold
me
down
to
this
low
sphere
when
thou
didst
grieve
ah
should
death
come
upon
morn
rosy
breast
i
fear
i
crave
reprieve
but
when
her
gold
all
spent
the
sad
day
takes
her
flight
when
shadows
creep
then
just
to
put
my
hand
in
thine
and
say
and
fall
asleep
the
cricket
o
the
gayest
of
musicians
o
the
gladdest
thing
on
earth
with
its
piping
and
its
chirping
is
the
cricket
on
the
hearth
there
is
magic
in
the
music
that
he
flings
us
with
such
zest
love
the
only
wealth
that
lasting
who
cares
aught
for
all
the
rest
never
mind
though
dog
you
never
mind
though
times
are
hard
have
you
not
the
wife
and
bairns
chirps
the
sweet
insistent
bard
chirps
and
chirps
until
you
heed
him
till
your
heart
is
all
aglow
love
the
only
wealth
that
lasting
home
a
bit
of
heaven
below
o
the
gayest
of
musicians
o
the
gladdest
thing
on
earth
with
his
piping
and
his
chirping
is
the
cricket
on
the
hearth
earth
to
the
twentieth
century
you
can
not
take
from
out
my
heart
the
growing
the
green
sweet
growing
and
the
vivid
thrill
o
earth
you
cry
you
should
be
old
not
glowing
with
youth
and
all
youth
strength
and
beauty
still
old
and
the
new
hopes
stirring
in
my
bosom
old
and
my
children
drawing
life
from
me
old
in
my
womb
the
tender
bud
and
blossom
old
steeped
in
richness
and
fertility
old
while
the
growing
things
call
to
each
other
in
language
i
alone
can
understand
how
she
doth
nourish
us
this
wondrous
mother
who
is
so
beautiful
and
strong
and
grand
old
while
the
wild
things
of
the
forest
hide
them
in
my
gray
coverts
which
no
eye
can
trace
hunted
or
hurt
is
my
task
to
provide
them
healing
and
soothing
and
a
hiding
place
and
then
my
human
children
could
you
listen
to
secrets
whispered
in
the
stillness
deep
of
noonday
or
when
fall
and
glisten
is
on
my
bosom
that
men
laugh
and
weep
some
tell
me
moving
tales
of
love
and
passion
of
gladness
all
too
great
to
be
pent
in
the
sweet
old
theme
which
does
not
change
its
fashion
another
cries
out
brokenly
of
sin
while
others
filled
with
sorrow
fain
to
share
it
hide
faces
on
my
soft
brown
breast
sobbing
dear
mother
earth
we
can
not
bear
it
grim
death
has
stolen
all
that
we
loved
best
the
old
familiar
cry
of
loss
and
sorrow
i
hear
i
heard
it
yesterday
ay
and
will
hear
in
every
glad
that
ye
may
bring
to
me
o

i
answer
mourner
penitent
and
lover
with
stir
with
bud
and

and

peace
i

when

over
ye
shall
sleep
soundly
in
your

the
loss
the
longing
of
mankind
i

the
joys

and

the
soul
filled
full
of
shame
passion
was
hers
hate
and
impurity
the
gnawing
of
remorse
the
longing
vain
to
lose
the
mark
of
sin
the
scarlet
flush
of
fallen
womanhood
the
envy
of
the
spotless
the
desire
that
they
might
sink
low
in
the
mire
as
she
oh
what
a
soul
she
carried
on
that
day
the
women
drew
their
robes
back
from
her
touch
men
leered
and
children
seemed
afraid
to
meet
the
devilish
beauty
of
her
form
and
face
shunned
and
alone
till
one
came
to
her
side
and
spake
her
name
and
took
her
hand
in
his
and
what
he
said
is
past
the
telling
there
are
things
the
heart
knows
well
but
can
not
blazon
to
the
world
and
when
he
went
his
way
upon
her
brow
where
shame
had
lain
was
set
the
one
sweet
word
my
lady
nightingale
i
heard
you
singing
in
the
grove
my
lady
nightingale
the
thirsty
leaves
were
drinking
dew
and
all
the
sky
was
pale
a
silence
clear
as
bells
of
peace
your
song
thrilled
on
the
air
each
liquid
note
a
thing
of
joy
and
sweet
beyond
compare
not
all
of
joy
a
haunting
strain
of
sorrow
and
of
tears
a
note
of
grief
which
seemed
to
voice
the
sadness
of
the
years
was
pure
was
clear
was
wondrous
sweet
my
lady
nightingale
yet
subtly
sad
the
song
you
sang
when
all
the
sky
was
pale

blossoms
steeped
in

drenched
in

just
a
fragrant
breath
which
tells
you

just
a
breath
of

sweetness
breath
which

if
but
one
spark
of
honest
zeal
flashes
to
life
within
his
breast
a
feeble
spark
at
best
if
for
a
moment
he
doth
feel
a
dim
desire
to
throw
aside
the
bonds
that
idleness
has
wrought
to
do
to
be
the
man
he
ought
the
tyrant
thing
he
calls
his
pride
the
curse
of
all
things
good
on
earth
takes
on
the
cruel
midwife
role
and
each
high
impulse
of
the
soul
is
strangled
in
the
hour
of
birth
to
dig
i
am
ashamed
quoth
he
mine
is
the
pride
of
name
and
race
that
scorns
to
fill
such
humble
space
life
lowly
tasks
are
not
for
me
oh
he
can
flatter
with
his
tongue
can
toady
to
the
rich
and
great
can
fawn
on
those
he
feels
to
hate
until
from
out
his
nature
wrung
each
shred
of
honesty
and
zeal
each
impulse
independent
strong
till
truth
and
honor
but
a
song
and
naught
is
beautiful
or
real
the
trust
we
steal
the
brawn
we
steal
the
brain
the
man
beneath
us
in
the
fight
soon
learns
how
helpless
and
how
vain
to
plead
for
justice
or
for
right
we
steal
the
youth
we
steal
the
health
hope
courage
aspiration
high
we
steal
men
all
to
make
for
wealth
we
will
repent
us
by
and
by
meantime
a
gift
will
heaven
appease
great
god
forgive
our
charities
we
steal
the
children
laughter
shrill
we
steal
their
joys
they
can
taste
why
skip
like
young
lambs
on
a
hill
go
get
ye
to
your
task
in
haste
no
matter
that
they
droop
and
tire
that
heaven
cries
out
against
the
sin
the
gold
red
gold
that
we
desire
their
dimpled
hands
must
help
to
win
a
cheque
for
missions
if
you
please
great
god
forgive
our
charities
we
steal
the
light
from
lover
eyes
we
hush
the
tale
he
has
to
tell
of
pure
desire
of
tender
ties
no
man
can
serve
two
masters
well
so
loot
his
treasury
of
pride
his
holy
hopes
and
visions
steal
his
scatter
far
and
wide
and
grind
the
sparks
beneath
your
heel
a
cheque
will
cover
sins
like
these
great
god
forgive
our
charities
when
paganini
plays
dawn
laughs
the
bow
and
we
straight
see
the
sky
crimson
and
golden
and
gray
see
the
rosy
cloudlets
go
drifting
by
and
the
sheen
on
the
lark
as
soaring
high
he
carols
to
greet
the
day
fast
moves
the
bow
the
wonderful
strings
we
feel
the
joy
in
the
air
is
alive
with
the
glory
of
growing
things
with
wild
honeysuckle
that
creeps
and
clings
rose
of
the
briar
bush
queen
of
the
springs
anemones
frail
and
fair
we
listen
and
whisper
with
laughter
low
it
voices
rare
gladness
that
ancient
bow
then
sad
as
the
plaint
of
a
child
at
night
a
child
aweary
with
play
the
falling
of
shadows
a
lost
delight
the
moaning
of
watchers
counting
the
flight
of
hours
the
dark
and
day
it
echoes
the
cry
of
a
broken
heart
it
grieves
a
might
have
been
it
holds
all
the
passionate
tears
that
start
when
our
heaven
and
our
earth
drift
far
apart
and
the
way
lies
dark
between
it
stills
all
our
laughter
and
whispers
low
is
it
plays
on
that
ancient
bow
you
understand
you
lifted
eyes
to
me
sad
questioning
eyes
that
did
demand
why
i
should
thrust
back
childishly
the
friendship
warm
you
offered
me
ah
sweet
you
understand
was
that
my
heart
beat
rapturously
at
word
of
thine
at
touch
of
hand
at
tender
glance
vouchsafed
to
me
the
while
i
knew
it
must
not
be
ah
sweet
you
understand
there
neither
pain
nor
mystery
in
that
and
fragrant
land
to
which
you
journeyed
fearlessly
by
gates
of
pearl
and
jasper
sea
ah
sweet
you
understand
love
sacrifice
and
behold
a
woman
in
the
city
which
was
a
sinner
when
she
knew
that
jesus
sat
at
meat
in
the
pharisee
house
brought
an
alabaster
box
of
ointment
and
stood
at
his
feet
behind
him
weeping
and
began
to
wash
his
feet
with
tears
and
did
wipe
them
with
the
hairs
of
her
head
the
eyes
he
turned
on
her
who
kneeling
wept
were
filled
with
tenderness
and
pity
rare
but
looking
on
the
pharisee
there
crept
a
sorrow
and
a
hint
of
sternness
there
simon
i
have
somewhat
to
say
to
thee
the
master
voice
rang
clearly
out
and
stirred
with
its
new
note
of
full
authority
the
throng
who
pressed
to
catch
each
word
master
say
on
simon
said
and
muttered
in
his
beard
a
sinner
she
marvelling
the
while
that
on
the
drooping
head
the
hand
of
jesus
rested
tenderly
seest
thou
this
woman
simon
scornful
eyes
did
simon
bend
upon
the
woman
face
the
while
the
breath
of
love
sweet
sacrifice
rose
from
the
broken
box
and
filled
the
place
the
slimy
thing
that
grows
upon
a
frailty
that
waxes
fat
on
shame
of
ruined
lives
swelled
in
the
bosom
of
the
pharisee
into
thine
house
i
came
at
thy
request
weary
with
travel
and
thou
gavest
not
to
me
the
service
due
the
humblest
guest
no
towel
no
water
clear
and
cold
was
brought
to
wash
my
feet
but
she
whom
you
despise
out
of
the
great
affection
she
doth
bear
hath
made
a
basin
of
her
woman
eyes
a
towel
of
her
woman
wealth
of
hair
thou
gavest
me
no
kiss
o
simon
shame
thus
coldly
and
unlovingly
to
greet
the
prince
of
peace
but
ever
since
i
came
this
woman
hath
not
ceased
to
kiss
my
feet
he
loveth
most
who
hath
been
most
forgiven
o
simon
hearken
learn
the
great
truth
well
no
soul
on
faith
glad
wings
mounts
nearer
heaven
than
that
which
hath
been
prisoned
deep
in
hell
methinks
i
hear
her
say
thou
who
forgivest
my
many
sins
this
sweet
of
breath
i
pour
on
thee
dear
lord
while
yet
thou
for
love
is
ever
swift
to
outrun
death
upon
her
are
the
eyes
of
jesus
turned
with
gaze
which
seems
to
strengthen
and
to
bless
who
knows
how
long
the
soul
of
him
hath
yearned
for
some
such
token
of
rare
tenderness
the
flush
of
shame
flaunts
red
on
simon
cheeks
about
the
table
idle
babblings
cease
a
deep
full
silence
then
the
master
speaks
thy
faith
hath
saved
thee
go
in
peace
in
peace
when
the
dusk
comes
down
do
you
know
what
i
will
love
best
of
all
to
do
when
i
old
at
the
close
of
day
when
the
dusk
comes
down
and
the
shadows
play
and
the
wind
sings
loud
in
the
poplars
tall
i
will
love
to
get
into
my
corner
here
the
curtains
drawn
and
never
a
one
to
break
the
stillness
to
sit
here
alone
and
dream
of
these
good
old
times
my
dear
in
fancy
you
come
and
sit
by
my
side
i
can
see
your
face
with
my
eyes
close
shut
with
the
pride
and
the
softness
clearly
cut
the
obstinate
chin
and
the
forehead
wide
the
oval
cheek
and
the
smile
so
warm
the
dark
eyes
full
of
their
fun
and
power
with
the
tender
light
for
the
tender
hour
and
the
flash
of
fire
that
was
half
their
charm
i
whisper
was
sweet
when
youth
was
our
own
the
laughter
the
nonsense
the
freedom
from
care
the
castles
we
built
high
up
in
the
air
the
secrets
told
to
each
other
alone
not
all
of
laughter
the
world
went
wrong
and
the
shadows
pressed
till
my
heart
was
sore
i
never
be
glad
i
said
any
more
never
be
happy
or
gay
or
strong
o
the
sweetest
thing
in
the
hour
of
pain
is
to
have
one
near
us
who
understands
to
touch
us
gently
and
hold
our
hands
till
our
strength
and
courage
come
back
again
at
love
swift
pace
you
hurried
to
me
your
tender
words
they
will
ring
in
my
ears
when
i
sit
and
dream
after
long
long
years
the
shine
in
your
eyes
through
the
mists
i
see
our
lives
will
be
lying
so
far
apart
and
time
no
doubt
will
have
given
us
much
of
weary
wisdom
put
many
a
touch
of
his
withering
hand
on
face
and
heart
but
i
know
what
i
will
love
best
of
all
to
do
at
the
end
of
the
busy
day
when
the
dusk
comes
down
and
the
shadows
play
and
the
wind
sings
low
in
the
poplars
tall
i
will
love
to
get
into
my
corner
here
with
the
curtains
drawn
and
never
a
one
to
break
the
stillness
to
sit
here
alone
and
dream
of
these
happy
days
my
dear
and
take
my
treasures
from
memory
hold
the
tears
the
laughter
the
songs
that
were
sung
o
the
friends
we
love
when
the
heart
is
young
are
the
friends
we
love
when
the
heart
grows
old
the
ghosts
of
night
when
we
were
children
long
ago
and
crept
to
bed
at
close
of
day
with
backward
glance
and
footstep
slow
though
all
aweary
with
our
play
do
you
remember
how
the
room
the
little
room
with
window
deep
would
fill
with
shadows
and
with
gloom
and
fright
us
so
we
could
not
sleep
for
o
the
things
we
see
at
night
the
dragons
grim
the
goblins
tall
and
worst
of
all
the
ghosts
in
white
that
range
themselves
along
the
wall
we
could
but
cover
up
our
head
and
listen
to
our
heart
wild
beat
such
dreadful
things
about
our
bed
and
no
protection
save
a
sheet
then
slept
and
woke
quite
unafraid
the
sun
was
shining
and
we
found
our
shadows
and
our
ghosts
all
laid
our
world
a
glorious
for
o
the
things
we
see
at
night
the
dragons
grim
the
goblins
tall
and
worst
of
all
the
ghosts
in
white
that
range
themselves
along
the
wall
we
are
but
children
still
the
years
have
never
taught
us
to
be
bold
for
mark
our
trembling
and
our
fears
when
sometimes
as
in
days
of
old
we
in
the
darkness
lie
awake
and
see
come
stealing
to
our
side
a
ghostly
throng
the
grave
mistake
the
failure
big
the
broken
pride
for
o
the
things
we
see
at
night
the
dragons
grim
the
goblins
tall
and
worst
of
all
the
ghosts
in
white
that
range
themselves
along
the
wall
how
close
they
creep
how
big
they
loom
the
task
which
waits
the
cares
which
creep
a
child
affrighted
in
the
gloom
we
fain
would
hide
our
head
and
weep
when
lo
the
coward
fear
is
gone
the
golden
sunshine
fills
the
air
and
god
has
sent
us
with
the
dawn
the
strength
and
will
to
do
and
dare
for
o
the
things
we
see
at
night
the
dragons
grim
the
goblins
tall
and
worst
of
all
the
ghosts
in
white
that
range
themselves
along
the
wall
the
long
ago
o
life
has
its
seasons
joyous
and
drear
its
summer
sun
and
its
winter
snow
but
the
fairest
of
all
i
tell
you
dear
was
the
sweet
old
spring
of
the
long
ago
the
ever
and
ever
so
long
ago
when
we
walked
together
among
the
flowers
when
the
world
with
beauty
was
all
aglow
o
the
rain
and
dew
o
the
shine
and
showers
of
the
sweet
old
spring
of
the
long
ago
the
ever
and
ever
so
long
ago
a
hunger
for
all
of
the
past
delight
is
stirred
by
the
winds
that
softly
blow
can
you
spare
me
a
thought
from
heaven
for
the
sweet
old
spring
of
the
long
ago
the
ever
and
ever
so
long
ago
forgive
and
forget
i
tell
you
the
sweetest
thing
dear
heart
i
tell
you
the
sweetest
thing
is
saying
to
one
that
we
love
forgive
the
careless
words
and
the
sting
forgive
and
forget
and
be
friends
once
more
for
the
world
is
an
empty
place
without
the
light
of
your
warm
true
eyes
and
the
smile
of
your
tender
face
o
the
kissing
and
making
up
again
and
the
tender
whispering
i
tell
you
the
sweetest
thing
dear
heart
i
tell
you
the
sweetest
thing
i
tell
you
the
saddest
thing
dear
heart
i
tell
you
the
saddest
thing
is
coming
to
one
that
we
love
full
well
some
tender
message
to
bring
and
loitering
loitering
by
the
way
held
back
by
a
foolish
pride
till
it
all
too
late
to
say
forgive
when
at
length
we
reach
her
side
for
the
ears
are
heavy
and
can
not
hear
and
the
chill
lips
can
not
move
to
whisper
peace
though
our
hearts
may
break
with
longing
and
pain
and
love
o
this
coming
too
late
with
our
tenderness
o
the
passionate
tears
that
spring
i
tell
you
the
saddest
thing
dear
heart
i
tell
you
the
saddest
thing
then
let
us
make
haste
to
be
friends
again
make
haste
to
fold
to
our
breast
the
one
we
have
hurt
by
word
and
deed
though
we
loved
that
one
the
best
forgive
and
forget
forgive
and
forget
o
warm
in
the
eyes
is
the
glow
and
the
gleam
of
a
golden
light
from
the
shores
of
paradise
o
the
kissing
and
making
up
again
and
the
tender
whispering
i
tell
you
the
sweetest
thing
dear
heart
i
tell
you
the
sweetest
thing
the
argument
as
friend
she
said
i
will
be
kind
my
sympathy
will
rarely
fail
my
eyes
to
many
faults
be
blind
as
wife
i
lecture
scold
and
rail
be
full
of
moods
a
shrew
one
day
a
thing
of
tenderness
the
next
will
kiss
and
wound
a
woman
way
that
long
the
soul
of
man
has
vext
you
been
a
true
unselfish
man
have
thought
upon
my
good
alway
been
strong
to
shield
and
wise
to
plan
but
ah
there
is
a
change
there
mastery
in
your
my
wife
for
self
stands
up
and
eagerly
claims
all
my
love
and
all
my
life
the
body
and
the
soul
of
me
come
call
me
friend
and
own
me
such
nor
count
it
such
a
wondrous
thing
to
hold
me
close
thrill
at
my
touch
a
lord
and
master
there
the
sting
is
all
or
naught
with
you
you
plead
and
he
is
blest
who
boldly
wins
these
words
she
said
are
proof
indeed
that
love
and
selfishness
are
twins
yet
had
you
let
my
wisdom
sway
would
it
have
pleased
me
who
can
tell
i
might
have
said
regretfully
i
reasoned
far
too
well
the
secret
the
throng
about
her
did
not
know
her
nearest
friend
could
not
surmise
whence
came
the
brightness
and
the
glow
the
wondrous
radiance
of
her
eyes
one
said
half
enviously
your
face
is
beautiful
with
gladness
rare
with
that
warm
generous
heart
of
yours
some
precious
secret
you
must
share
ah
true
beneath
the
filmy
lace
that
rose
and
fell
upon
her
breast
her
first
held
its
place
from
him
from
him
whom
she
loved
best
vashti
o
last
days
of
the
year
she
whispered
low
you
fly
too
swiftly
past
ah
you
might
stay
a
while
a
little
while
do
you
not
know
what
tender
things
you
bear
with
you
away
i
thinking
sitting
in
the
soft
gloom
here
of
all
the
riches
that
were
mine
the
day
there
crept
down
on
the
world
the
soft
new
year
a
rosy
thing
with
promise
filled
and
gay
but
twelve
short
months
ago
a
little
space
in
which
to
lose
so
much
a
whole
life
wealth
of
love
and
faith
youth
and
youth
tender
grace
things
that
are
wont
to
go
from
us
by
stealth
laughter
and
blushes
and
the
rapture
strong
the
clasp
of
clinging
hands
the
kiss
the
joy
of
living
and
the
glorious
song
that
drew
its
sweetness
from
a
full
heart
bliss
o
wealth
of
tenderness
o
gladness
great
that
crowned
me
covered
me
a
year
ago
a
bankrupt
i
gone
faith
gone
warm
caress
gone
love
gone
youth
gone
all
she
whispered
low
oh
last
days
of
the
year
you
take
away
the
riches
that
i
held
so
close
and
dear
go
not
so
swiftly
stay
a
little
stay
with
one
poor
bankrupt
last
days
of
the
year
the
treasure
box
i
asked
aunt
persis
as
twilight
fell
if
she
had
things
of
value
hidden
safe
away
treasures
that
were
her
very
own
and
did
she
love
to
bring
them
forth
and
feast
her
eyes
upon
their
worth
and
finger
them
with
all
a
miser
greed
of
touch
she
smiled
that
slow
warm
smile
of
hers
and
drew
me
down
beside
her
in
the
inglenook
the
rain
beat
hard
against
the
panes
without
the
world
was
doubly
gray
with
twilight
and
with
cloud
the
room
was
full
of
shade
till
persis
stirred
the
slumbering
grate
fire
wide
awake
and
made
it
send
its
flickering
shafts
of
light
into
each
corner
dim
gay
shafts
that
chased
the
shadows
forth
and
took
their
place
then
stole
away
and
let
the
shadow
back
and
then
gave
chase
again
the
maddest
and
the
stillest
game
to
music
of
the
raindrops
on
the
pane
and
wind
that
softly
shrilled
about
the
eaves
the
treasure
box
was
opened
wide
and
its
contents
exposed
to
the
rude
gaze
of
one
too
young
too
to
know
their
value
great
i
thought
to
see
pearls
corals
quaint
gems
or
lace
like
gossamer
creamed
by
the
hand
of
time
real
treasures
worthy
of
the
hoarding
lo
i
saw
a
book
a
worn
and
musty
thing
with
ragged
leaves
and
many
marks
what
is
it
i
asked
to
me
it
looks
the
that
some
stupid
child
has
learned
its
lesson
from
and
so
it
is
she
smiled
my
father
testament
and
at
his
knee
i
conned
the
golden
rule
and
all
the
wondrous
truths
that
teach
us
how
to
live
is
dear
to
me
you
may
suppose
a
knot
of
ribbon
that
had
once
been
blue
a
braid
of
dark
brown
hair
a
spray
of
lily
o
the
valley
withered
sere
yet
holding
still
a
breath
of
sweetness
indescribable
some
letters
tied
with
silk
a
broken
fan
some
verses
scribbled
on
a
yellow
page
a
baby
shoe
more
letters
and
what
think
you
friend
a
string
of
amber
beads
without
a
trace
of
value
beads
of
glass
strung
on
a
bit
of
twine
aunt
persis
took
them
in
her
hand
and
let
the
firelight
play
on
them
my
grandmother
first
gift
she
said
and
slipped
them
round
her
neck
i
love
them
best
of
all
my
ornaments
each
amber
bead
holds
fast
a
joy
caught
in
the
childhood
days
of
pleasantness
and
when
i
sit
here
with
the
sparkling
things
held
close
the
joys
they
gathered
long
ago
slip
from
them
to
my
heart
and
ere
i
know
i
am
a
child
once
more
treasures
nay
dear
one
in
your
clear
young
eyes
i
see
the
disappointment
grow
no
treasures
these
you
say
these
faded
things
and
poor
these
musty
ragged
things
but
some
day
in
the
gloaming
of
your
life
you
ope
your
treasure
box
and
find
a
hoard
of
just
such
things
as
these
a
few
rare
trifles
wrapped
in
memories
the
message
my
marjorie
doth
hold
in
her
white
hands
a
spray
of
lilies
plucked
below
the
brook
where
the
old
ruin
of
a
chapel
stands
a
ruin
tenanted
by
many
a
nook
and
all
the
grayness
of
it
hid
from
sight
by
gracious
draping
of
the
ivy
green
sweet
lilies
is
your
glorious
fate
to
lie
upon
her
breast
to
send
between
her
silken
bodice
and
the
heart
beneath
the
fragrance
given
you
by
sun
and
shower
speak
subtly
with
your
warm
breath
till
the
dance
and
music
of
the
hour
she
turn
you
eyes
and
glowing
face
with
ah
ye
grew
in
that
old
trysting
place
estranged
it
is
she
said
the
world
is
wide
there
space
for
you
and
me
to
walk
apart
though
we
have
walked
together
side
by
side
my
thoughts
all
yours
my
your
heart
we
now
will
go
our
different
ways
forget
the
happy
past
i
would
not
have
you
keep
one
thought
of
me
ah
yes
my
eyes
are
wet
my
love
is
great
my
grief
must
needs
be
deep
yet
i
have
strength
to
look
at
you
and
say
forget
it
all
forget
our
souls
were
stirred
forget
the
sweetness
of
each
dear
dead
day
the
warm
impassioned
kiss
the
tender
word
the
clinging
handclasp
and
the
eyes
forget
all
these
but
when
we
walk
apart
remember
this
though
wilful
and
unwise
no
word
of
mine
did
ever
hurt
your
heart
the
parting
one
summer
morning
i
heard
a
lark
singing
to
heaven
a
bird
one
winter
night
i
was
glad
in
the
dark
because
of
the
wondrous
song
i
had
heard
the
joy
of
life
i
have
heard
you
say
is
my
love
my
laughter
my
smiles
and
tears
when
i
have
gone
on
the
long
strange
way
let
these
stay
with
you
through
all
the
years
these
be
the
lark
song
what
is
love
worth
that
can
not
crowd
in
the
time
that
given
to
two
like
us
on
this
gray
old
earth
such
bliss
as
will
last
till
we
reach
heaven
dear
one
think
oft
of
the
full
glad
years
and
thinking
of
them
forget
to
weep
whisper
remembrance
holds
no
tears
and
kiss
my
mouth
when
i
fall
on
sleep
margaret

eyes
upon
a
summer
day

not
more
blue

it

their
lone
divided
ways
but
ever
with

remembrance
the
subtle
breath
of

upon

he
sends
to
make
it
fair
and
fragrant
in
memoriam
tribute
to
george
the
golden
rule
the
blessed
creed
that
shelters
frail
humanity
the
tender
thought
for
those
in
need
the
charity
of
word
and
deed
without
which
all
is
vanity
this
friend
you
made
your
very
own
and
yours
the
satisfying
part
to
pluck
the
rose
of
love
full
blown
to
reap
the
gladness
you
had
sown
with
open
hand
and
kindly
heart
simplicity
the
jewel
rare
whose
gleam
is
ever
true
and
warm
that
thing
of
worth
beyond
compare
which
none
but
truly
great
may
wear
adorned
your
life
with
power
and
charm
yours
the
sincerity
that
grips
fast
hold
of
natures
strong
and
wise
it
thrilled
you
to
your
it
set
its
seal
on
brow
and
lips
and
shone
within
your
dark
true
eyes
the
throng
knew
not
how
rich
the
store
of
sympathy
and
trust
you
had
knew
not
you
were
till
life
was
god
almoner
among
his
poor
god
comforter
to
sick
and
sad
too
soon
you
went
we
miss
the
cheer
the
kindliness
vouchsafed
to
all
the
world
seems
strangely
lone
and
drear
when
one
whom
many
hearts
hold
dear
fares
heavenward
ere
the
shadows
fall
too
soon
you
went
and
yet
maybe
your
work
well
done
your
task
complete
the
soul
of
you
turned
longingly
toward
gates
of
pearl
and
jasper
sea
and
fields
of
eden
rarely
sweet
