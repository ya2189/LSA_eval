four
bells
were
struck
the
watch
was
called
on
deck
all
work
aboard
was
over
for
the
hour
and
some
men
sang
and
others
played
at
check
or
mended
clothes
or
watched
the
sunset
glower
the
bursting
west
was
like
an
opening
flower
and
one
man
watched
it
till
the
light
was
dim
but
no
one
went
across
to
talk
to
him
he
was
the
painter
in
that
swift
crew
lampman
and
painter
tall
a
man
young
for
his
years
and
not
yet
sickly
and
not
yet
brown
with
the
tan
bullied
and
damned
at
since
the
voyage
being
neither
man
nor
seaman
by
his
tally
he
bunked
with
the
idlers
just
abaft
the
galley
his
work
began
at
five
he
worked
all
day
keeping
no
watch
and
having
all
night
in
his
work
was
what
the
mate
might
care
to
say
he
mixed
red
lead
in
many
a
bouilli
tin
his
dungarees
were
smeared
with
paraffin
go
drown
himself
his
mates
advised
him
and
all
hands
called
him
dauber
and
despised
him
si
the
apprentice
stood
beside
the
spar
stripped
to
the
waist
a
basin
at
his
side
slushing
his
hands
to
get
away
the
tar
and
then
he
washed
himself
and
rinsed
and
dried
towelling
his
face
eager
eyed
he
crossed
the
spar
to
dauber
and
there
stood
watching
the
gold
of
heaven
turn
to
blood
they
stood
there
by
the
rail
while
the
swift
ship
tore
on
out
of
the
tropics
straining
her
sheets
whitening
her
trackway
to
a
milky
strip
dim
with
green
bubbles
and
twisted
water
meets
her
clacking
tackle
tugged
at
pins
and
cleats
her
great
sails
bellied
stiff
her
great
masts
leaned
they
watched
how
the
seas
struck
and
burst
and
greened
si
talked
with
dauber
standing
by
the
side
why
did
you
come
to
sea
painter
he
said
i
want
to
be
a
painter
he
replied
and
know
the
sea
and
ships
from
a
to
z
and
paint
great
ships
at
sea
before
dead
ships
under
skysails
running
down
the
trade
ships
and
the
sea
nothing
finer
made
but
so
much
to
learn
with
sails
and
ropes
and
how
the
sails
look
full
or
being
furled
and
how
the
lights
change
in
the
troughs
and
slopes
and
the
colours
up
and
down
the
world
and
how
a
storm
looks
when
the
sprays
are
hurled
high
as
the
yard
they
say
i
want
to
see
none
ashore
can
teach
such
things
to
me
and
then
the
men
and
rigging
and
the
way
ships
move
running
or
beating
and
the
poise
at
the
end
the
checking
in
the
sway
i
want
to
paint
them
perfect
short
of
the
noise
and
then
the
life
the
full
of
boys
the
with
the
men
there
dripping
wet
i
know
the
subjects
that
i
want
to
get
not
been
done
the
sea
not
yet
been
done
from
the
inside
by
one
who
really
knows
give
up
all
if
i
could
be
the
one
but
art
comes
dear
the
way
the
money
goes
so
i
have
come
to
sea
and
i
suppose
three
years
will
teach
me
all
i
want
to
learn
and
make
enough
to
keep
me
till
i
earn
even
as
he
spoke
his
busy
pencil
moved
drawing
the
leap
of
water
off
the
side
where
the
great
clipper
trampled
making
the
blue
hills
of
the
sea
divide
shearing
a
glittering
scatter
in
her
stride
and
leaping
on
full
tilt
with
all
sails
drawing
proud
as
a
snuffing
battle
pawing
i
can
not
get
it
yet
not
yet
he
said
that
leap
and
light
and
sudden
change
to
green
and
all
the
glittering
from
the
red
and
the
milky
colours
where
the
bursts
have
been
and
then
the
clipper
striding
like
a
queen
over
it
all
all
beauty
to
the
crown
i
see
it
all
i
can
not
put
it
down
hard
not
to
be
able
there
look
there
i
can
not
get
the
movement
nor
the
light
sometimes
it
almost
makes
a
man
despair
to
try
and
try
and
never
get
it
right
oh
if
i
could
oh
if
i
only
might
i
mind
what
hells
have
to
pass
not
if
the
whole
world
called
me
fool
and
ass
down
sank
the
crimson
sun
into
the
sea
the
wind
cut
chill
at
once
the
west
grew
dun
out
sidelights
called
the
mate
hi
where
is
he
the
boatswain
called
out
sidelights
damn
you
run
always
late
or
lazing
murmured
one
the
dauber
with
his
sketching
soon
the
tints
of
red
and
green
passed
on
dark
darker
it
grew
still
darker
and
the
stars
burned
golden
and
the
fiery
fishes
came
the
loudened
from
the
straining
spars
the
clacked
together
always
the
same
the
rushing
fishes
streaked
the
seas
with
flame
racing
the
one
speed
noble
as
their
own
what
unknown
joy
was
in
those
fish
unknown
just
by
the
door
as
it
grew
dark
the
boatswain
caught
the
dauber
with
now
you
till
now
spared
you
damn
you
now
you
hark
just
had
hell
for
what
you
do
have
you
broke
and
sent
among
the
crew
if
you
get
me
more
trouble
by
a
particle
you
forget
you
daubing
useless
article
you
thing
you
thing
from
port
mahon
then
came
the
is
that
the
dauber
there
why
you
leave
them
stinking
paints
alone
they
stink
the
house
out
poisoning
all
the
air
just
take
them
out
where
to
i
care
where
i
have
stinking
paint
here
from
their
plates
right
wet
paint
breeds
fever
growled
his
mates
he
took
his
still
wet
drawings
from
the
berth
and
climbed
the
ladder
to
the
top
beneath
the
noisy
rang
with
mirth
for
two
boys
were
putting
on
the
strop
one
clambering
up
to
let
the
skylight
drop
saw
him
bend
down
beneath
a
boat
and
lay
his
drawings
there
till
all
were
hid
away
and
stand
there
silent
leaning
on
the
boat
watching
the
constellations
rise
and
burn
until
the
beauty
took
him
by
the
throat
so
stately
is
their
glittering
overturn
armies
of
marching
eyes
armies
that
yearn
with
banners
rising
and
falling
and
passing
by
over
the
empty
silence
of
the
sky
the
dauber
sighed
there
looking
at
the
sails
arches
leaning
on
the
night
the
high
trucks
traced
on
heaven
and
left
no
trails
the
moonlight
made
the
topsails
almost
white
the
passing
sidelight
seemed
to
drip
green
light
and
on
the
clipper
rushed
with
bows
he
sighed
never
and
left
the
house
now
said
the
reefer
up
come
sam
come
si
been
hiding
something
up
they
slid
treading
on
naked
tiptoe
stealthily
to
grope
for
treasure
at
the
skid
drawings
said
sam
is
this
what
dauber
hid
lord
i
expected
pudding
not
this
rot
still
come
have
some
fun
with
what
got
they
smeared
the
paint
with
turpentine
until
they
could
remove
with
every
trace
of
quick
perception
caught
by
patient
skill
and
lines
that
had
brought
blood
into
his
face
they
wiped
the
pigments
off
and
did
erase
with
knives
all
sticking
clots
when
they
had
done
under
the
boat
they
laid
them
every
one
all
he
had
drawn
since
first
he
came
to
sea
his
six
leisure
fruits
they
laid
them
there
they
chuckled
then
to
think
how
mad
be
finding
his
paintings
vanished
into
air
eight
bells
were
struck
and
feet
from
everywhere
went
shuffling
aft
to
muster
in
the
dark
the
pipe
glowed
above
a
dim
red
spark
names
in
the
darkness
passed
and
voices
cried
the
red
spark
glowed
and
died
the
faces
seemed
as
things
remembered
when
a
brain
has
died
to
all
but
high
intenseness
deeply
dreamed
like
hissing
spears
the
fire
streamed
and
on
the
clipper
rushed
with
tossing
mast
a
bath
of
flame
broke
round
her
as
she
passed
the
watch
was
set
the
night
came
and
the
men
hid
from
the
moon
in
shadowed
nooks
to
sleep
bunched
like
the
dead
still
like
the
dead
as
when
plague
in
a
city
leaves
none
even
to
weep
the
track
brightened
to
a
sweep
the
mate
there
felt
her
pulse
and
eyed
the
spars
by
south
she
staggered
under
the
stars
down
in
his
bunk
the
dauber
lay
awake
thinking
of
his
unfitness
for
the
sea
each
failure
each
derision
each
mistake
there
in
the
life
not
made
for
such
as
he
a
morning
grim
with
trouble
sure
to
be
a
noon
of
pain
from
failure
and
a
night
bitter
with
contemning
and
despite
this
in
the
first
beginning
the
green
leaf
still
in
the
trades
before
bad
weather
fell
what
harvest
would
he
reap
of
hate
and
grief
when
the
loud
horn
made
every
life
a
hell
when
the
sick
ship
lay
over
clanging
her
bell
and
no
time
came
for
painting
or
for
drawing
but
all
hands
fought
and
icy
death
came
clawing
hell
he
expected
hell
his
eyes
grew
blind
the
snoring
from
his
messmates
droned
and
snuffled
and
then
a
gush
of
pity
calmed
his
mind
the
cruel
torment
of
his
thought
was
muffled
without
on
deck
an
old
old
seaman
shuffled
humming
his
song
and
through
the
open
door
a
moonbeam
moved
and
thrust
along
the
floor
the
green
bunk
curtains
moved
the
brass
rings
clicked
the
cook
cursed
in
his
sleep
turning
and
turning
the
moving
finger
touched
and
picked
and
all
the
stars
in
all
the
sky
were
burning
this
is
the
art
come
for
and
am
learning
the
sea
and
ships
and
men
and
travelling
things
it
is
most
proud
whatever
pain
it
brings
he
leaned
upon
his
arm
and
watched
the
light
sliding
and
fading
to
the
steady
roll
this
he
would
some
day
paint
the
ship
at
night
and
sleeping
seamen
tired
to
the
soul
the
space
below
the
bunks
as
black
as
coal
gleams
upon
chests
upon
the
unlit
lamp
the
ranging
door
hook
and
the
locker
clamp
this
he
would
paint
and
that
and
all
these
scenes
and
proud
ships
carrying
on
and
men
their
minds
and
blues
of
rollers
toppling
into
greens
and
shattering
into
white
that
bursts
and
blinds
and
scattering
ships
running
erect
like
hinds
and
men
in
oilskins
beating
down
a
sail
high
on
the
yellow
yard
in
snow
in
hail
with
faces
ducked
down
from
the
slanting
drive
of
hail
mixed
with
spray
the
roaring
canvas
like
a
thing
alive
shaking
the
mast
knocking
their
hands
away
the
jerking
to
the
tug
and
sway
the
savage
eyes
at
the
rims
and
icicles
on
the
brims
and
sunnier
scenes
would
grow
under
his
brush
the
tropic
dawn
with
all
things
dropping
dew
the
darkness
and
the
wonder
and
the
hush
the
insensate
grey
before
the
marvel
grew
then
the
veil
lifted
from
the
trembling
blue
the
walls
of
sky
burst
in
the
flower
the
rose
all
the
expanse
of
heaven
a
mind
that
glows
he
turned
out
of
his
bunk
the
cook
still
tossed
one
of
the
other
two
spoke
in
his
sleep
a
cockroach
scuttled
where
the
moonbeam
crossed
outside
there
was
the
ship
the
night
the
deep
it
is
worth
while
the
youth
said
i
will
keep
to
my
resolve
learn
to
paint
all
this
my
lord
my
god
how
beautiful
it
is
outside
was
the
rush
to
the
hurry
a
resonant
from
every
rope
the
broadening
in
a
fiery
flurry
the
leaning
masts
in
their
majestic
slope
and
all
things
strange
with
moonlight
filled
with
hope
by
all
that
beauty
going
as
man
bade
he
turned
and
slept
in
peace
eight
bells
were
made
ii
next
day
was
sunday
his
free
painting
day
while
the
fine
weather
held
from
eight
till
eight
he
rose
when
called
at
five
and
did
array
the
gear
and
set
the
straight
then
kneeling
down
like
housemaid
at
a
grate
he
scrubbed
the
deck
with
sand
until
his
knees
were
blue
with
dye
from
his
wet
dungarees
soon
all
was
clean
his
sunday
tasks
were
done
his
day
was
clear
for
painting
as
he
chose
the
wetted
decks
were
drying
in
the
sun
the
men
coiled
up
or
swabbed
or
sought
repose
the
drifts
of
silver
arrows
fell
and
rose
as
flying
fish
took
wing
the
breakfast
passed
wasting
good
time
but
he
was
free
at
last
free
for
two
hours
and
more
to
tingle
deep
catching
a
likeness
in
a
line
or
tint
the
canvas
running
up
in
a
proud
sweep
at
the
clews
and
white
like
lint
the
glittering
of
the
blue
waves
into
glint
free
to
attempt
it
all
the
proud
pawings
the
sea
the
sky
he
went
to
fetch
his
drawings
up
to
the
top
he
quickly
climbed
he
stooped
to
find
them
underneath
the
boat
he
found
them
all
obliterated
slimed
blotted
erased
gone
from
him
line
and
note
they
were
all
spoiled
a
lump
came
in
his
throat
being
vain
of
his
attempts
and
tender
skinned
beneath
the
skylight
watching
reefers
grinned
he
clambered
down
holding
the
ruined
things
bosun
he
called
look
here
did
you
do
these
wipe
off
my
paints
and
cut
them
into
strings
and
smear
them
till
you
tell
chalk
from
cheese
stare
but
did
you
do
it
answer
please
the
bosun
turned
give
you
a
thick
ear
do
it
i
get
to
hell
from
here
i
touch
your
stinking
daubs
the
daft
a
crowd
was
gathering
now
to
hear
the
fun
the
reefers
tumbled
out
the
men
laid
aft
the
cook
blinked
cleaning
a
mess
kid
in
the
sun
up
with
dauber
now
said
everyone
someone
has
spoiled
my
drawings
look
at
this
well
a
dirty
trick
by
god
it
is
it
is
said
sam
a
dirty
trick
to
spoil
a
work
in
such
a
way
and
if
you
catch
him
dauber
punch
him
sick
for
he
deserves
it
be
he
who
he
may
a
seaman
shook
his
old
head
wise
and
grey
it
seems
to
me
he
said
who
no
judge
them
drawings
look
much
better
now
smudge
where
were
they
dauber
on
the
where
under
the
in
a
secret
place
the
blackguard
must
have
seen
you
put
them
there
he
is
a
swine
i
tell
him
to
his
face
i
think
anyone
so
base
nor
i
said
dauber
there
was
six
time
just
wasted
in
these
drawings
a
crime
well
you
say
we
did
it
growled
his
mates
and
as
for
crime
be
damned
the
things
were
smears
best
overboard
like
you
with
shot
for
weights
thank
god
gone
and
now
go
shake
your
ears
the
dauber
listened
very
near
to
tears
dauber
if
i
were
you
said
sam
again
aft
and
see
the
captain
and
complain
a
sigh
came
from
the
assembled
seamen
there
would
he
be
such
a
fool
for
their
delight
as
go
to
tell
the
captain
would
he
dare
and
would
the
thunder
roar
the
lightning
smite
there
was
the
captain
come
to
take
a
sight
handling
his
sextant
by
the
aft
the
dauber
turned
the
seamen
thought
him
daft
the
captain
took
his
sights
a
mate
below
noted
the
times
they
shouted
to
each
other
the
captain

and

and
please
remember
that
not
on
shore
the
dauber
touched
his
brow
and
slunk
away
they
eyed
his
going
with
a
bitter
eye
dauber
said
sam
what
did
the
captain
say
the
dauber
drooped
his
head
without
reply
go
forward
dauber
and
enjoy
your
cry
the
mate
limped
to
the
rail
like
little
feet
over
his
head
the
drumming
beat
the
dauber
reached
the
berth
and
entered
in
much
mockery
followed
after
as
he
went
and
each
face
seemed
to
greet
him
with
the
grin
of
hounds
hot
following
on
a
creature
spent
you
a
fool
each
mocking
visage
meant
who
did
it
dauber
what
did
captain
say
it
is
a
crime
and
be
hell
to
pay
he
bowed
his
head
the
house
was
full
of
smoke
the
sails
was
pointing
shackles
on
his
chest
lord
dauber
be
a
man
and
take
a
joke
he
puffed
his
pipe
and
let
the
matter
rest
spit
brown
my
son
and
get
a
hairy
breast
get
shoulders
on
you
at
the
crojick
braces
and
let
this
painting
business
go
to
blazes
what
good
can
painting
do
to
anyone
i
say
never
do
it
far
from
that
no
harm
in
sometimes
painting
just
for
fun
keep
it
for
fun
and
stick
to
what
at
your
to
fill
your
bones
up
and
get
fat
rib
up
like
bull
and
thick
your
neck
throw
paints
to
hell
boy
you
belong
on
deck
right
said
chips
downright
good
advice
no
good
what
good
can
painting
do
up
on
a
lower
topsail
stiff
with
ice
with
all
your
little
frozen
blue
painting
help
you
at
the
weather
clew
nor
pass
your
gaskets
for
you
nor
make
sail
a
balmy
job
not
worth
a
nail
the
dauber
did
not
answer
time
was
passing
he
pulled
his
easel
out
his
paints
his
stool
the
wind
was
dropping
and
the
sea
was
glassing
new
realms
of
beauty
waited
for
his
rule
the
draught
out
of
the
crojick
kept
him
cool
he
sat
to
paint
alone
and
melancholy
no
turning
fools
the
chips
said
from
their
folly
he
dipped
his
brush
and
tried
to
fix
a
line
and
then
came
peace
and
gentle
beauty
came
turning
his
water
into
wine
lightening
his
darkness
with
a
touch
of
flame
o
joy
of
trying
for
beauty
ever
the
same
you
never
fail
your
comforts
never
end
o
balm
of
this
way
o
perfect
friend
iii
they
lost
the
trades
soon
after
then
came
calm
light
little
gusts
and
rain
which
soon
increased
to
glorious
northers
shouting
out
a
psalm
at
seeing
the
bright
blue
water
silver
fleeced
hornwards
she
rushed
trampling
the
seas
to
yeast
there
fell
a
in
a
blind
end
when
for
an
hour
the
dauber
found
a
friend
out
of
the
rain
the
voices
called
and
passed
the
flogged
the
tackle
yanked
and
shook
inside
the
a
lantern
cast
light
and
wild
shadows
as
it
ranged
its
hook
the
watch
on
deck
was
gathered
in
the
nook
they
had
taken
shelter
in
that
secret
place
wild
light
gave
wild
emotions
to
each
face
one
beat
the
and
the
others
sang
a
song
that
had
brought
anchors
out
of
seas
in
ports
where
bells
of
christians
never
rang
nor
any
sea
mark
blazed
among
the
trees
by
forlorn
swamps
in
ice
by
windy
keys
that
song
had
sounded
now
it
shook
the
air
from
these
eight
wanderers
brought
together
there
under
the
sheltering
from
the
rain
the
dauber
sketched
some
likeness
of
the
room
a
note
to
be
a
prompting
to
his
brain
a
spark
to
make
old
memory
reillume
dauber
said
someone
near
him
in
the
gloom
how
goes
it
dauber
it
was
reefer
si
not
much
use
in
trying
to
keep
dry
they
sat
upon
the
doorway
coaming
the
lad
held
forth
like
youth
the
dauber
listened
to
how
the
boy
had
had
a
taste
for
roaming
and
what
the
sea
is
said
to
be
and
where
the
dim
lamplight
fell
the
wet
deck
glistened
si
said
the
horn
was
still
some
weeks
away
but
tell
me
dauber
where
hail
from
eh
the
rain
blew
past
and
let
the
stars
appear
the
seas
grew
larger
as
the
moonlight
grew
for
half
an
hour
the
ring
of
heaven
was
clear
dusty
with
moonlight
grey
rather
than
blue
in
that
great
moon
the
showing
stars
were
few
the
sleepy
feet
passed
overhead
i
come
from
out
past
gloucester
dauber
said
not
far
from
pauntley
if
you
know
those
parts
the
place
is
spital
farm
near
silver
hill
above
a
where
a
starts
we
had
the
mill
once
but
stopped
the
mill
my
dad
and
sister
keep
the
farm
on
still
only
tenants
but
rented
there
father
and
son
for
over
eighty
year
father
has
worked
the
farm
since
grandfer
went
it
means
the
world
to
him
i
think
why
they
bleed
him
to
the
last
for
rent
and
this
and
that
have
almost
milked
him
dry
the
all
starved
if
put
money
by
and
corn
was
up
and
rent
was
down
but
then
they
so
the
use
of
words
yet
still
he
bear
to
see
it
pass
to
strangers
or
to
think
a
time
would
come
when
other
men
than
us
would
mow
the
grass
and
other
names
than
ours
have
the
home
some
sorrows
come
from
evil
thought
but
some
comes
when
two
men
are
near
and
both
are
blind
to
what
is
generous
in
the
mind
i
was
the
only
boy
and
father
thought
farm
the
spital
after
he
was
dead
and
many
a
time
he
took
me
out
and
taught
about
manures
and
white
and
red
and
soils
and
hops
but
an
empty
head
harvest
or
seed
i
would
not
do
a
turn
i
loathed
the
farm
i
want
to
learn
he
did
not
mind
at
first
he
thought
it
youth
feeling
the
collar
and
that
i
should
change
then
time
gave
him
some
inklings
of
the
truth
and
that
i
loathed
the
farm
and
wished
to
range
truth
to
a
man
of
always
strange
it
was
most
strange
and
terrible
to
him
that
i
his
heir
should
be
the
limb
yet
still
he
hoped
the
lord
might
change
my
mind
see
him
his
wrath
and
hate
and
almost
break
my
heart
he
was
so
kind
biting
his
lips
sore
with
resolve
to
wait
and
then
try
awhile
but
it
was
fate
i
want
to
learn
the
farm
to
me
was
mire
and
hopeless
work
and
misery
though
there
were
things
i
loved
about
it
too
the
beasts
the
and
going
haying
and
then
i
tried
but
no
it
do
the
farm
was
prison
and
my
thoughts
were
straying
and
come
father
with
his
grey
head
praying
my
dear
son
let
the
spital
pass
my
old
home
boy
where
your
grandfer
was
now
you
learn
farming
you
care
the
old
nought
to
you
tried
to
teach
you
begged
almighty
god
boy
all
i
dare
to
use
his
hand
if
word
of
mine
reach
you
boy
for
your
sake
i
do
beseech
you
let
the
spital
pass
to
strangers
squire
has
said
give
it
you
if
we
require
mother
used
to
walk
here
boy
with
me
it
was
her
favourite
walk
down
to
the
mill
and
there
talk
how
little
death
would
be
knowing
our
work
was
going
on
here
still
got
the
brains
you
only
want
the
will
disappoint
your
mother
and
your
father
give
you
time
to
travel
if
but
no
wander
up
the
brooks
to
read
then
sister
jane
would
start
with
nagging
tongue
saying
my
sin
made
heart
to
bleed
and
how
she
feared
live
to
see
me
hung
and
then
read
me
bits
from
young
and
when
we
three
would
sit
to
supper
jane
would
fillip
dad
till
dad
began
again
been
here
all
my
life
boy
i
was
born
up
in
the
room
above
looks
on
the
mead
i
never
thought
cockle
my
clean
corn
and
leave
the
old
home
to
a
seed
father
and
i
have
made
here
a
weed
give
our
lives
to
make
that
eighty
years
and
now
i
go
down
to
the
grave
in
and
then
get
ashamed
and
take
off
coat
and
work
maybe
a
week
ploughing
and
sowing
and
then
creep
away
and
sail
my
boat
or
watch
the
water
when
the
mill
was
going
my
delight
to
be
near
water
flowing
dabbling
or
sailing
boats
or
jumping
stanks
or
finding
nests
along
the
banks
and
one
day
father
found
a
ship
built
he
took
the
to
me
over
that
and
i
half
mad
with
pain
and
sick
with
guilt
went
up
and
hid
in
what
we
called
the
flat
a
dusty
hole
given
over
to
the
cat
she
kittened
there
the
kittens
had
worn
paths
among
the
cobwebs
dust
and
broken
laths
and
putting
down
my
hand
between
the
beams
i
felt
a
leathery
thing
and
pulled
it
clear
a
book
with
white
cocoons
stuck
in
the
seams
where
spiders
had
had
nests
for
many
a
year
it
was
my
hid
i
fear
lest
dad
should
ever
see
it
life
was
not
her
own
while
she
was
wife
there
were
her
drawings
dated
pencilled
faint
march
was
the
last
one
eighteen
unfinished
that
for
tears
had
smeared
the
paint
the
rest
was
landscape
not
yet
brought
to
be
that
was
a
holy
afternoon
to
me
that
book
a
sacred
book
the
flat
a
place
where
i
could
meet
my
mother
face
to
face
she
had
found
peace
of
spirit
mother
had
drawing
the
landscape
from
the
attic
there
often
after
rows
with
dad
hid
like
a
wild
thing
in
a
secret
lair
that
rotting
showed
me
how
and
where
i
too
could
get
away
and
then
i
knew
that
drawing
was
the
work
i
longed
to
do
drawing
became
my
life
i
drew
i
toiled
and
every
penny
i
could
get
i
spent
on
paints
and
matters
which
i
spoiled
up
in
the
attic
to
my
content
till
one
day
father
asked
me
what
i
meant
the
time
had
come
he
said
to
make
an
end
now
it
must
finish
what
did
i
intend
either
i
took
to
farming
like
his
son
in
which
case
he
would
teach
me
early
and
late
provided
that
my
daubing
mood
was
done
or
i
must
go
it
must
be
settled
straight
if
i
refused
to
farm
there
was
the
gate
i
was
to
choose
his
patience
was
all
gone
the
present
state
of
things
could
not
go
on
sister
was
there
she
eyed
me
while
he
spoke
the
kitchen
clock
ran
down
and
struck
the
hour
and
something
told
me
heart
was
broke
for
all
he
stood
so
set
and
looked
so
sour
jane
took
a
duster
and
began
to
scour
a
pewter
on
the
dresser
she
was
crying
i
stood
stock
still
a
long
time
not
replying
dad
waited
then
he
snorted
and
turned
round
think
of
it
he
said
he
left
the
room
his
boots
went
clop
along
the
stony
ground
out
to
the
orchard
and
the
a
cloud
came
past
the
sun
and
made
a
gloom
i
swallowed
with
dry
lips
then
sister
turned
she
was
dead
white
but
for
her
eyes
that
burned
breaking
heart
joe
she
began
not
as
if
she
checked
in
too
much
pain
joe
help
to
kill
so
fine
a
man
giving
him
our
mother
over
again
wearing
him
to
death
joe
heart
and
brain
you
know
what
store
he
sets
on
leaving
this
to
too
cruel
to
a
son
of
his
you
go
painting
all
the
day
o
joe
you
make
an
effort
you
see
what
folly
it
is
of
yours
not
as
though
you
are
a
genius
or
could
ever
be
o
joe
for
sake
if
not
for
me
give
up
this
craze
for
painting
and
be
wise
and
work
with
father
where
your
duty
goes
too
deep
i
said
loathe
the
farm
i
help
even
if
the
mind
even
if
i
helped
only
do
him
harm
father
would
see
it
if
he
were
not
blind
i
was
not
built
to
farm
as
he
would
find
o
jane
bitter
hard
to
stand
alone
and
spoil
my
life
or
spoil
my
both
she
said
way
shaping
now
only
a
boy
not
knowing
your
own
good
where
will
you
go
suppose
you
leave
here
how
do
you
propose
to
earn
your
daily
food
draw
daub
the
pavements
a
feckless
brood
goes
to
the
devil
daily
joe
in
cities
only
from
thinking
how
divine
their
wit
is
are
they
without
water
carried
away
and
be
one
of
them
the
way
going
daubing
at
silly
pictures
all
the
day
and
praised
by
silly
fools
always
blowing
and
you
choose
this
when
you
might
go
casting
the
good
corn
into
chosen
mould
that
shall
in
time
bring
forth
a
so
we
went
on
but
in
the
end
it
ended
i
felt
done
a
murder
i
felt
sick
much
in
human
minds
can
not
be
mended
and
that
not
i
played
dad
a
cruel
trick
there
was
one
mercy
that
it
ended
quick
i
went
to
join
my
brother
he
lived
down
the
severn
he
was
kind
to
me
and
there
i
learned
for
a
living
have
been
happy
there
but
that
i
knew
sinned
before
my
father
past
forgiving
and
that
they
sat
at
home
that
silent
two
wearing
the
fire
out
and
the
evening
through
silent
defeated
broken
in
despair
my
plate
unset
my
name
gone
and
my
chair
i
saw
all
that
and
sister
jane
came
white
white
as
a
ghost
with
fiery
weeping
eyes
i
saw
her
all
day
long
and
half
the
night
bitter
as
gall
and
passionate
and
wise
you
have
killed
your
father
there
he
lies
you
have
done
your
work
you
with
our
she
said
it
plain
and
then
her
eyes
would
blaze
and
then
one
day
i
had
a
job
to
do
down
below
bridge
by
where
the
docks
begin
and
there
i
saw
a
clipper
towing
through
up
from
the
sea
that
morning
entering
in
raked
to
the
nines
she
was
lofty
and
thin
her
ensign
ruffling
red
her
bunts
in
pile
beauty
and
strength
together
wonder
style
she
docked
close
to
the
gates
and
there
she
lay
over
the
water
from
me
well
in
sight
and
as
i
worked
i
watched
her
all
the
day
finding
her
beauty
ever
fresh
delight
her
was
bright
green
with
strips
of
white
high
in
the
sunny
air
it
rose
to
shake
above
the
skysail
most
splendid
rake
and
when
i
felt
unhappy
i
would
look
over
the
river
at
her
and
her
pride
so
calm
so
quiet
came
as
a
rebuke
to
half
the
passionate
pathways
which
i
tried
and
though
the
autumn
ran
its
term
and
died
and
winter
fell
and
cold
december
came
she
was
still
splendid
there
and
still
the
same
then
on
a
day
she
sailed
but
when
she
went
my
mind
was
clear
on
what
i
had
to
try
to
see
the
sea
and
ships
and
what
they
meant
that
was
the
thing
i
longed
to
do
so
i
drew
and
worked
hard
and
studied
and
put
by
and
thought
of
nothing
else
but
that
one
end
but
let
all
else
go
hang
love
money
friend
and
now
shipped
as
dauber
begun
it
was
hard
work
to
find
a
berth
i
any
friends
to
find
me
one
only
my
skill
for
what
it
may
be
worth
but
at
sea
now
going
about
the
earth
and
when
the
paid
off
when
we
return
join
some
paris
studio
and
learn
he
stopped
the
air
came
moist
si
did
not
speak
the
dauber
turned
his
eyes
to
where
he
sat
pressing
the
hinges
with
his
cheek
his
face
half
covered
with
a
drooping
hat
huge
dewdrops
from
the
dropped
and
spat
si
did
not
stir
the
dauber
touched
his
sleeve
a
little
birdlike
noise
came
from
a
sheave
si
was
asleep
sleeping
a
calm
deep
sleep
still
as
a
warden
of
the
egyptian
dead
in
some
old
haunted
temple
buried
deep
under
the
desert
sand
sterile
and
red
the
dauber
shook
his
arm
si
jumped
and
said
good
yarn
i
swear
i
say
you
have
a
brain
was
that
eight
bells
that
went
he
slept
again
then
waking
up
had
a
nap
he
cried
was
that
one
bell
what
dauber
you
still
here
si
there
the
voice
called
sir
he
replied
the
order
made
the
thick
vision
clear
a
something
in
the
voice
made
him
fear
si
said
the
mate
i
hear
made
a
friend
dauber
in
short
that
got
to
end
a
young
gentleman
your
place
aboard
is
with
the
gentlemen
abaft
the
mast
learning
to
command
you
afford
to
yarn
with
any
man
but
there
past
done
it
once
let
this
time
be
the
last
the
place
is
forward
do
it
again
put
you
bunking
forward
with
the
men
dismiss
si
went
but
sam
beside
the
mate
timekeeper
there
walked
with
him
to
the
rail
and
whispered
him
the
menace
of
you
wait
words
which
have
turned
full
many
a
reefer
pale
the
watch
was
changed
the
watch
on
deck
trimmed
sail
sam
going
below
called
all
the
reefers
down
sat
in
his
bunk
and
eyed
them
with
a
frown
si
here
he
said
has
soiled
the
name
talking
to
dauber
dauber
the
clout
a
reefer
takes
the
dauber
for
a
flame
the
take
the
walking
out
soiled
the
honour
now
no
doubt
the
bosun
and
his
mates
will
come
here
sneaking
asking
for
smokes
or
blocking
gangways
speaking
not
a
vain
man
given
to
blow
or
boast
not
a
proud
man
but
i
truly
feel
that
while
bossed
this
mess
and
ruled
this
roast
kept
this
damned
genteel
si
must
ask
pardon
or
be
made
to
squeal
down
on
your
knees
dog
them
we
love
we
chasten
jao
pasea
my
son
in
english
hasten
si
begged
for
pardon
meekly
kneeling
down
before
the
mess
assembled
grim
the
lamp
above
them
smoked
the
glass
all
brown
beyond
the
door
the
dripping
sails
were
dim
the
dauber
passed
the
door
none
spoke
to
him
he
sought
his
berth
and
slept
or
waking
heard
rain
on
the
rain
no
other
word
iv
our
of
the
air
a
time
of
quiet
came
calm
fell
upon
the
heaven
like
a
drouth
the
brass
sky
watched
the
brassy
water
flame
drowsed
as
a
snail
the
clipper
loitered
south
slowly
with
no
white
bone
across
her
mouth
no
rushing
glory
like
a
queen
made
bold
the
dauber
strove
to
draw
her
as
she
rolled
there
the
four
leaning
spires
of
canvas
rose
royals
and
skysails
lifting
gently
lifting
white
like
the
brightness
that
a
great
fish
blows
when
billows
are
at
peace
and
ships
are
drifting
with
mighty
jerks
that
set
the
shadows
shifting
the
courses
tugged
their
tethers
a
blue
haze
drifted
like
ghosts
of
flocks
come
down
to
graze
there
the
great
skyline
made
her
perfect
round
notched
now
and
then
by
the
deeper
blue
a
marked
a
steamer
homeward
bound
the
haze
wrought
all
things
to
intenser
hue
in
tingling
impotence
the
dauber
drew
as
all
men
draw
keen
to
the
shaken
soul
to
give
a
hint
that
might
suggest
the
whole
a
naked
seaman
washing
a
red
shirt
sat
at
a
tub
whistling
between
his
teeth
complaining
blocks
quavered
like
something
hurt
a
sailor
cut
an
old
boot
for
a
sheath
the
ship
bowed
to
her
beneath
and
little
slaps
of
spray
came
at
the
roll
on
to
the
from
the
he
watched
it
painting
patiently
as
paints
with
eyes
that
pierce
behind
the
blue
veil
the
benedictine
in
a
book
of
saints
watching
the
passing
of
the
holy
grail
the
green
dish
dripping
blood
the
trump
the
hail
the
spears
that
pass
the
memory
and
the
passion
the
beauty
moving
under
this
fashion
but
as
he
painted
slowly
man
by
man
the
seamen
gathered
near
the
bosun
stood
behind
him
jeering
then
the
sails
began
sniggering
with
comment
that
it
was
not
good
chips
flicked
his
sketch
with
little
scraps
of
wood
saying
that
hit
the
every
time
cook
mocked
my
lovely
drawings
a
crime
slowly
the
men
came
nearer
till
a
crowd
stood
at
his
elbow
muttering
as
he
drew
the
bosun
turning
to
them
spoke
aloud
this
is
the
ship
that
never
got
there
you
look
at
her
here
what
trying
to
do
look
at
her
lummy
like
a
that
a
ship
he
calls
this
painting
see
seeing
the
crowd
the
mate
came
forward
then
sir
said
the
bosun
come
and
see
the
sight
dauber
makes
a
circus
for
the
men
he
calls
this
thing
a
ship
this
delight
man
said
the
mate
never
get
her
right
daubing
like
that
look
here
he
took
a
brush
now
dauber
watch
put
you
to
the
blush
look
here
look
there
now
watch
this
ship
of
mine
he
drew
her
swiftly
from
a
memory
stored
god
sir
the
bosun
said
you
do
her
fine
ay
said
the
mate
i
do
so
by
the
lord
paint
a
ship
with
any
man
aboard
they
hung
about
his
sketch
like
beasts
at
bait
there
now
i
taught
him
painting
said
the
mate
when
he
had
gone
the
gathered
men
dispersed
yet
two
or
three
still
lingered
to
dispute
what
errors
made
the
work
the
worst
they
probed
his
want
of
knowledge
to
the
root
bei
gott
they
swore
der
dauber
can
not
do
he
haf
no
knolich
how
to
put
der
pense
der
is
goot
der
dauber
haf
no
sense
you
hear
the
bosun
cried
you
can
not
do
it
a
gospel
truth
the
cook
said
true
as
hell
and
wisdom
dauber
if
you
only
knew
it
a
five
year
boy
would
do
a
ship
as
well
if
the
kind
of
thing
you
hope
to
sell
god
help
you
echoed
chips
i
tell
you
true
the
beyond
you
dauber
drop
it
do
drop
it
in
name
drop
it
and
have
done
you
see
you
can
not
do
it
the
mate
paints
you
to
frazzles
before
everyone
paints
you
a
dandy
clipper
while
you
wait
while
you
lord
love
us
daub
i
tell
you
straight
had
enough
of
daubing
drop
it
quit
you
can
not
paint
so
make
an
end
of
it
sense
said
all
you
can
not
why
pretend
the
dauber
rose
and
put
his
easel
by
said
enough
he
said
now
let
it
end
who
cares
how
bad
my
painting
may
be
i
mean
to
go
on
and
if
i
fail
to
try
however
much
i
miss
of
my
intent
if
i
have
done
my
best
be
content
you
can
not
understand
that
let
it
be
you
can
not
understand
nor
know
nor
share
this
is
a
matter
touching
only
me
my
sketch
may
be
a
daub
for
aught
i
care
you
may
be
right
but
even
if
you
were
your
mocking
should
not
stop
this
work
of
mine
rot
though
it
be
its
prompting
is
divine
you
can
not
understand
that
you
and
you
and
you
you
bosun
you
can
stand
and
jeer
that
is
the
task
your
spirit
fits
you
to
that
you
can
understand
and
hold
most
dear
grin
then
like
collars
ear
to
donkey
ear
but
let
me
daub
try
you
to
understand
which
task
will
bear
the
light
best
on
hand
v
the
wester
came
as
steady
as
the
trades
brightly
it
blew
and
still
the
ship
did
shoulder
the
brilliance
of
the
white
cockades
into
the
milky
green
of
smoky
smoulder
the
sky
grew
bluer
and
the
air
grew
colder
southward
she
thundered
while
the
westers
held
proud
with
taut
bridles
pawing
but
compelled
and
still
the
dauber
strove
though
all
men
mocked
to
draw
the
splendour
of
the
passing
thing
and
deep
inside
his
heart
a
something
locked
long
pricking
in
him
now
began
to
sting
a
fear
of
the
disasters
storm
might
bring
his
rank
as
painter
would
be
ended
then
he
would
keep
watch
and
watch
like
other
men
and
go
aloft
with
them
to
man
the
yard
when
the
great
ship
was
rolling
scuppers
under
burying
her
snout
all
round
the
compass
card
while
the
green
water
struck
at
her
and
stunned
her
when
the
slacked
when
one
long
thunder
boomed
from
the
black
to
windward
when
the
sail
booted
and
spurred
the
devil
in
the
gale
for
him
to
ride
on
men
that
was
the
time
the
dauber
dreaded
then
the
test
would
come
when
seas
slushed
the
decks
with
slime
and
all
the
air
was
blind
with
flying
scum
when
the
drenched
sails
were
furled
when
the
fierce
hum
in
weather
riggings
died
into
the
roar
of
eternal
never
tamed
by
shore
once
in
the
passage
he
had
worked
aloft
shifting
her
suits
one
summer
afternoon
in
the
bright
trade
wind
when
the
wind
was
soft
shaking
the
points
making
the
tackle
croon
but
that
was
play
to
the
future
soon
he
would
be
ordered
up
when
sails
and
spars
were
flying
and
going
mad
among
the
stars
he
had
been
scared
that
first
time
daunted
thrilled
not
by
the
height
so
much
as
by
the
size
and
then
the
danger
to
the
man
unskilled
in
standing
on
a
rope
that
runs
through
eyes
but
in
a
storm
he
thought
the
yards
will
rise
and
roll
together
down
and
snap
their
gear
the
sweat
came
cold
upon
his
palms
for
fear
sometimes
in
gloucester
he
had
felt
a
pang
swinging
below
the
on
a
stage
but
stages
carry
rails
here
he
would
hang
upon
a
jerking
rope
in
a
rage
ducked
that
the
sheltering
oilskin
might
assuage
the
beating
of
the
storm
clutching
the
jack
beating
the
sail
and
being
beaten
back
drenched
frozen
gasping
blinded
beaten
dumb
high
in
the
night
reeling
great
blinding
arcs
as
the
ship
rolled
his
chappy
fingers
numb
the
deck
below
a
narrow
blur
of
marks
the
sea
a
welter
of
whiteness
shot
with
sparks
now
snapping
up
in
bursts
now
dying
away
salting
the
horizontal
snow
with
spray
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
above
the
deck
and
there
while
the
ship
rolls
boldly
to
sit
upon
a
moving
jerk
and
check
while
half
a
dozen
seamen
work
on
it
held
by
one
hand
straining
by
strength
and
wit
to
toss
a
coil
around
the
yard
how
could
he
compass
that
when
blowing
hard
and
if
he
failed
in
any
least
degree
or
faltered
for
an
instant
or
showed
slack
he
might
go
drown
himself
within
the
sea
and
add
a
bubble
to
the
track
he
had
signed
his
name
there
was
no
turning
back
no
pardon
for
default
this
must
be
done
one
iron
rule
at
sea
binds
everyone
till
now
he
had
been
treated
with
contempt
as
neither
man
nor
thing
a
creature
borne
on
the
articles
but
left
exempt
from
all
the
life
except
their
scorn
but
he
would
rank
as
seaman
off
the
horn
work
as
a
seaman
and
be
kept
or
cast
by
standards
set
for
men
before
the
mast
even
now
they
shifted
suits
of
sails
they
bent
the
ready
for
the
expected
time
the
mighty
wester
that
the
plate
had
lent
had
brought
them
far
into
the
wintry
clime
at
dawn
out
of
the
shadow
there
was
rime
the
dim
magellan
clouds
were
frosty
clear
the
wind
had
edge
the
was
near
and
then
he
wondered
if
the
tales
were
lies
told
by
old
hands
to
terrify
the
new
for
since
the
ship
left
england
only
twice
had
there
been
need
to
start
a
sheet
or
clew
then
only
royals
for
an
hour
or
two
and
no
seas
broke
aboard
nor
was
it
cold
what
were
these
gales
of
which
the
stories
told
the
thought
went
by
he
had
heard
the
bosun
tell
too
often
and
too
fiercely
not
to
know
that
being
off
the
horn
in
june
is
hell
hell
of
continual
toil
in
ice
and
snow
frostbitten
hell
in
which
the
westers
blow
shrieking
for
days
on
end
in
which
the
seas
gulf
the
starved
seamen
till
their
marrows
freeze
such
was
the
weather
he
might
look
to
find
such
was
the
work
expected
there
remained
firmly
to
set
his
teeth
resolve
his
mind
and
be
the
first
however
much
it
pained
and
bring
his
honour
round
the
horn
unstained
and
win
his
respect
and
thence
untainted
be
ranked
as
man
however
much
he
painted
he
drew
deep
breath
a
gantline
swayed
aloft
a
lower
topsail
hard
with
rope
and
leather
such
as
frozen
fingers
fight
with
oft
below
the
ramirez
in
cape
horn
weather
the
arms
upon
the
yard
hove
all
together
lighting
the
head
along
a
thought
occurred
within
the
brain
like
a
bright
bird
that
this
and
so
much
like
it
of
toil
compassed
by
naked
manhood
in
strange
places
was
all
heroic
but
outside
the
coil
within
which
modern
art
gleams
or
grimaces
that
if
he
drew
that
line
of
faces
sweating
the
sail
their
passionate
play
and
change
it
would
be
new
and
wonderful
and
strange
that
that
was
what
his
work
meant
it
would
be
a
training
in
new
vision
a
revealing
of
passionate
men
in
battle
with
the
sea
high
on
an
unseen
stage
shaking
and
reeling
and
men
through
him
would
understand
their
feeling
their
might
their
misery
their
tragic
power
and
all
by
suffering
pain
a
little
hour
high
on
the
yard
with
them
feeling
their
pain
battling
with
them
and
it
had
not
been
done
he
was
a
door
to
new
worlds
in
the
brain
a
window
opening
letting
in
the
sun
a
voice
saying
thus
is
bread
fetched
and
ports
won
and
life
lived
out
at
sea
where
men
exist
solely
by
strong
brain
and
sturdy
wrist
so
he
decided
as
he
cleaned
his
brasses
hearing
without
aloft
the
curse
the
shout
where
the
taut
gantline
passes
and
repasses
heaving
new
topsails
to
be
lighted
out
it
was
most
proud
however
self
might
doubt
to
share
tragic
toil
and
paint
it
true
he
took
the
offered
fate
this
he
would
do
that
night
the
snow
fell
between
six
and
seven
a
little
feathery
fall
so
light
so
dry
an
aimless
dust
out
of
a
confused
heaven
upon
an
air
no
steadier
than
a
sigh
the
powder
dusted
down
and
wandered
by
so
purposeless
so
many
and
so
cold
then
died
and
the
wind
ceased
and
the
ship
rolled
rolled
till
she
clanged
rolled
till
the
brain
was
tired
marking
the
acme
of
the
heaves
the
pause
while
the
rested
and
respired
drinking
great
draughts
of
roller
at
her
hawse
flutters
of
snow
came
aimless
upon
flaws
lock
up
your
paints
the
mate
said
speaking
light
this
is
the
horn
join
my
watch
vi
all
through
the
windless
night
the
clipper
rolled
in
a
great
swell
with
oily
gradual
heaves
which
rolled
her
down
until
her
tolled
clang
and
the
weltering
water
moaned
like
beeves
the
thundering
rattle
of
slatting
shook
the
sheaves
startles
of
water
made
the
swing
ports
gush
the
sea
was
moaning
and
sighing
and
saying
hush
it
was
all
black
and
starless
peering
down
into
the
water
trying
to
pierce
the
gloom
one
saw
a
dim
smooth
oily
glitter
of
brown
heaving
and
dying
away
and
leaving
room
for
yet
another
like
the
march
of
doom
came
those
great
powers
of
marching
silences
then
fog
came
down
and
hid
the
seas
they
set
the
dauber
to
the
foghorn
there
he
stood
upon
the
poop
making
to
sound
out
of
the
pump
the
nasal
blare
listening
lest
ice
should
make
the
note
resound
she
bayed
there
like
a
solitary
hound
lost
in
a
covert
all
the
watch
she
bayed
the
fog
come
closelier
down
no
answer
made
denser
it
grew
until
the
ship
was
lost
the
elemental
hid
her
she
was
merged
in
mufflings
of
dark
death
like
a
ghost
new
to
the
change
of
death
yet
thither
urged
then
from
the
hidden
waters
something
surged
mournful
despairing
great
greater
than
speech
a
noise
like
one
slow
wave
on
a
still
beach
mournful
and
then
again
mournful
and
still
out
of
the
night
that
mighty
voice
arose
the
dauber
at
his
foghorn
felt
the
thrill
who
rode
that
desolate
sea
what
forms
were
those
mournful
from
things
defeated
in
the
throes
of
memory
of
some
conquered
out
of
the
night
of
death
arose
the
sound
whales
said
the
mate
they
stayed
there
all
night
long
answering
the
horn
out
of
the
night
they
spoke
defeated
creatures
who
had
suffered
wrong
but
were
still
noble
underneath
the
stroke
they
filled
the
darkness
when
the
dauber
woke
the
men
came
peering
to
the
rail
to
hear
and
the
sea
sighed
and
the
fog
rose
up
sheer
a
wall
of
nothing
at
the
last
edge
where
no
life
came
except
defeated
life
the
dauber
felt
shut
in
within
a
hedge
behind
which
form
was
hidden
and
thought
was
rife
and
that
a
blinding
flash
a
thrust
a
knife
would
sweep
the
hedge
away
and
make
all
plain
brilliant
beyond
all
words
blinding
the
brain
so
the
night
passed
but
then
no
morning
broke
only
a
something
showed
that
night
was
dead
a
cackling
like
a
devil
spoke
and
the
fog
drew
away
and
hung
like
lead
like
mighty
cliffs
it
shaped
sullen
and
red
like
glowering
gods
at
watch
it
did
appear
and
sometimes
drew
away
and
then
drew
near
like
islands
and
like
chasms
and
like
hell
but
always
mighty
and
red
gloomy
and
ruddy
shutting
the
visible
sea
in
like
a
well
slow
heaving
in
vast
ripples
blank
and
muddy
where
the
sun
should
have
risen
it
streaked
bloody
the
day
was
all
the
scattering
splashed
the
still
water
mewing
hovering
clattering
then
polar
snow
came
down
little
and
light
till
all
the
sky
was
hidden
by
the
small
most
multitudinous
drift
of
dirty
white
tumbling
and
wavering
down
and
covering
all
covering
the
sky
the
sea
the
clipper
tall
furring
the
ropes
with
white
casing
the
mast
coming
on
no
known
air
but
blowing
past
and
all
the
air
seemed
full
of
gradual
moan
as
though
in
those
the
horns
were
blowing
the
mort
for
gods
cast
out
and
overthrown
or
for
the
eyeless
sun
plucked
out
and
going
slow
the
low
gradual
moan
came
in
the
snowing
the
dauber
felt
the
prelude
had
begun
the
snowstorm
fluttered
by
he
saw
the
sun
show
and
pass
by
gleam
from
one
towering
prison
into
another
vaster
and
more
grim
which
in
dull
crags
of
darkness
had
arisen
to
a
final
door
on
him
the
gods
upon
the
dull
crags
lowered
dim
the
pigeons
chattered
quarrelling
in
the
track
in
the
the
dimness
dulled
to
black
then
came
the
cry
of
call
all
hands
on
deck
the
dauber
knew
its
meaning
it
was
come
cape
horn
that
tramples
beauty
into
wreck
and
crumples
steel
and
smites
the
strong
man
dumb
down
clattered
flying
kites
and
staysails
some
sang
out
in
quick
high
calls
the
skirled
and
from
the
came
the
end
of
the
world
caught
in
her
said
the
bosun
hauling
quick
high
came
the
call
it
was
all
wallop
of
sails
and
startled
calling
let
fly
let
go
clew
up
and
let
go
all
now
up
and
make
them
fast
here
give
us
a
haul
now
up
and
stow
them
quick
by
god
done
the
blackness
crunched
all
memory
of
the
sun
up
said
the
mate
mizen
hurry
the
dauber
ran
the
others
ran
the
sails
slatted
and
shook
out
of
the
black
a
flurry
whirled
in
fine
lines
tattering
the
edge
to
trails
painting
and
art
and
england
were
old
tales
told
in
some
other
life
to
that
pale
man
who
struggled
with
white
fear
and
gulped
and
ran
he
struck
a
ringbolt
in
his
haste
and
fell
rose
sick
with
pain
in
his
left
knee
he
reached
the
shrouds
where
clambering
men
hustled
each
other
up
and
cursed
him
he
hurried
aloft
with
them
then
from
the
sea
came
a
cold
sudden
breath
that
made
the
hair
stiff
on
the
neck
as
though
death
whispered
there
a
man
below
him
punched
him
in
the
side
get
up
you
dauber
or
let
me
get
past
he
saw
the
belly
of
the
skysail
skied
gulped
and
clutched
tight
and
tried
to
go
more
fast
sometimes
he
missed
his
ratline
and
was
grassed
scraped
his
shin
raw
against
the
rigid
line
the
clamberers
reached
the
incline
cursing
they
came
one
kicking
out
behind
kicked
dauber
in
the
mouth
and
one
below
punched
at
his
calves
the
inclined
it
was
a
perilous
path
for
one
to
go
up
dauber
up
a
curse
followed
a
blow
he
reached
the
top
and
gasped
then
on
then
on
and
one
voice
yelled
let
go
and
one
all
gone
fierce
clamberers
some
in
oilskins
some
in
rags
hustling
and
hurrying
up
up
the
steep
stairs
before
the
windless
sails
were
blown
to
flags
and
whirled
like
dirty
birds
athwart
great
airs
ten
men
in
all
to
get
this
mast
of
theirs
snugged
to
the
gale
in
time
up
damn
you
run
the
mizen
topmast
head
was
safely
won
lay
out
the
bosun
yelled
the
dauber
laid
out
on
the
yard
gripping
the
yard
and
feeling
sick
at
the
mighty
space
of
air
displayed
below
his
feet
where
mewing
birds
were
wheeling
a
giddy
fear
was
on
him
he
was
reeling
he
bit
his
lip
half
through
clutching
the
jack
a
cold
sweat
glued
the
shirt
upon
his
back
the
yard
was
shaking
for
a
brace
was
loose
he
felt
that
he
would
fall
he
clutched
he
bent
clammy
with
natural
terror
to
the
shoes
while
idiotic
promptings
came
and
went
snow
fluttered
on
a
and
was
spent
he
saw
the
water
darken
someone
yelled
frap
it
stay
to
furl
hold
on
he
held
darkness
came
down
half
darkness
in
a
whirl
the
sky
went
out
the
waters
disappeared
he
felt
a
shocking
pressure
of
blowing
hurl
the
ship
upon
her
side
the
darkness
speared
at
her
with
wind
she
staggered
she
careered
then
down
she
lay
the
dauber
felt
her
go
he
saw
his
yard
tilt
downwards
then
the
snow
whirled
all
about
dense
multitudinous
cold
mixed
with
the
one
devilish
thrust
and
shriek
which
whiffled
out
tears
deafened
took
hold
flattening
the
flying
drift
against
the
cheek
the
yards
buckled
and
bent
man
could
not
speak
the
ship
lay
on
her
broadside
the
sound
had
devilish
malice
at
having
got
her
downed
how
long
the
gale
had
blown
he
could
not
tell
only
the
world
had
changed
his
life
had
died
a
moment
now
was
everlasting
hell
nature
an
onslaught
from
the
weather
side
a
withering
rush
of
death
a
frost
that
cried
shrieked
till
he
withered
at
the
heart
a
hail
plastered
his
oilskins
with
an
icy
mail
cut
yelled
his
mate
he
looked
the
sail
was
gone
blown
into
rags
in
the
first
furious
squall
the
tatters
drummed
the
tattoo
on
the
buckling
yard
a
block
thumped
like
a
mall
the
ship
lay
the
sea
smote
her
the
bawl
came
loo
loo
loo
the
devil
cried
his
hounds
on
to
the
poor
spent
stag
strayed
in
his
bounds
cut
ease
her
yelled
his
mate
the
dauber
heard
his
mate
wormed
up
the
tilted
yard
and
slashed
a
rag
of
canvas
skimmed
like
a
darting
bird
the
snow
whirled
the
ship
bowed
to
it
the
gear
lashed
the
were
cut
off
and
flung
down
smashed
tatters
of
shouts
were
flung
the
rags
of
yells
and
clang
clang
clang
below
beat
the
two
bells
o
god
the
dauber
moaned
a
roaring
rang
blasting
the
royals
like
a
cannonade
the
backstays
parted
with
a
cracking
clang
the
upper
spars
were
snapped
like
twigs
decayed
snapped
at
their
heels
their
jagged
splinters
splayed
like
white
and
ghastly
hair
erect
with
fear
the
mate
yelled
gone
by
god
and
pitched
them
clear
up
yelled
the
bosun
up
and
clear
the
wreck
the
dauber
followed
where
he
led
below
he
caught
one
giddy
glimpsing
of
the
deck
filled
with
white
water
as
though
heaped
with
snow
he
saw
the
streamers
of
the
rigging
blow
straight
out
like
pennons
from
the
splintered
mast
then
all
sense
dimmed
all
was
an
icy
blast
roaring
from
nether
hell
and
filled
with
ice
roaring
and
crashing
on
the
jerking
stage
an
utter
bridle
given
to
utter
vice
limitless
power
mad
with
endless
rage
withering
the
soul
a
minute
seemed
an
age
he
clutched
and
hacked
at
ropes
at
rags
of
sail
thinking
that
comfort
was
a
told
long
ago
long
long
ago
long
since
heard
of
in
other
lives
imagined
dreamed
there
where
the
basest
beggar
was
a
prince
to
him
in
torment
where
the
tempest
screamed
comfort
and
warmth
and
ease
no
longer
seemed
things
that
a
man
could
know
soul
body
brain
knew
nothing
but
the
wind
the
cold
the
pain
leave
that
the
bosun
shouted
crojick
save
the
splitting
crojick
not
yet
gone
to
rags
thundered
below
beating
till
something
gave
bellying
between
its
buntlines
into
bags
some
birds
were
blown
past
shrieking
dark
like
shags
their
backs
seemed
looking
down
leu
leu
they
cried
the
ship
lay
the
seas
thumped
her
she
had
died
they
reached
the
crojick
yard
which
buckled
buckled
like
a
thin
whalebone
to
the
strain
they
laid
upon
the
yard
and
heaved
and
knuckled
pounding
the
sail
which
jangled
and
leapt
again
it
was
quite
hard
with
ice
its
rope
like
chain
its
strength
like
seven
devils
it
shook
the
mast
they
cursed
and
toiled
and
froze
a
long
time
passed
two
hours
passed
then
a
dim
lightening
came
those
frozen
ones
upon
the
yard
could
see
the
mainsail
and
the
foresail
still
the
same
still
battling
with
the
hands
and
blowing
free
rags
tattered
where
the
staysails
used
to
be
the
lower
topsails
stood
the
lee
deck
seethed
with
four
feet
of
water
filled
with
wreck
an
hour
more
went
by
the
dauber
lost
all
sense
of
hands
and
feet
all
sense
of
all
but
of
a
wind
that
cut
him
to
the
ghost
and
of
a
frozen
fold
he
had
to
haul
of
heavens
that
fell
and
never
ceased
to
fall
and
ran
in
smoky
snatches
along
the
sea
leaping
from
crest
to
yelling
he
lost
sense
of
time
no
bells
went
but
he
felt
ages
go
over
him
at
last
at
last
they
frapped
the
cringled
icy
pelt
in
frozen
bulge
and
bunt
they
made
it
fast
then
scarcely
live
they
laid
in
to
the
mast
the
speaking
trumpet
gave
a
blare
make
fast
the
topsail
mister
while
there
some
seamen
cursed
but
up
they
had
to
go
up
to
the
topsail
yard
to
spend
an
hour
stowing
a
topsail
in
a
blinding
snow
which
made
the
strongest
man
among
them
cower
more
men
came
up
the
fresh
hands
gave
them
power
they
stowed
the
sail
then
with
a
rattle
of
chain
one
half
the
crojick
burst
its
bonds
again
they
stowed
the
sail
frapping
it
round
with
rope
leaving
no
surface
for
the
wind
no
fold
then
down
the
weather
shrouds
half
dead
they
grope
that
struggle
with
the
sail
had
made
them
old
they
wondered
if
the
crojick
furl
would
hold
lucky
said
one
it
spring
the
spar
lucky
the
bosun
said
lucky
we
are
she
came
within
two
shakes
of
turning
top
or
stripping
all
her
that
first
quiff
now
fish
those
buckets
out
of
the
slop
dauber
says
he
like
cape
stiff
this
wind
man
this
is
only
a
whiff
hold
on
all
hands
hold
on
a
sea
half
seen
paused
mounted
burst
and
filled
the
green
the
dauber
felt
a
mountain
of
water
fall
it
covered
him
deep
deep
he
felt
it
fill
over
his
head
the
deck
the
all
quieting
the
ship
she
trembled
and
lay
still
then
with
a
rush
and
shatter
and
clanging
shrill
over
she
went
he
saw
the
water
cream
over
the
bitts
he
saw
the
stream
then
in
the
rush
he
swirled
over
she
went
her
dipped
he
struck
and
something
gave
his
legs
went
through
a
port
as
the
roll
spent
she
paused
then
rolled
and
back
the
water
drave
he
drifted
with
it
as
a
part
of
the
wave
drowning
exhausted
partly
frozen
he
struck
the
booby
hatchway
then
the
bosun
leaped
seeing
his
chance
before
the
next
sea
burst
and
caught
him
as
he
drifted
seized
him
held
him
against
the
bitts
and
cursed
this
the
swimming
baths
he
yelled
keep
on
your
feet
another
felled
the
two
together
and
the
bose
spat
a
joke
he
cursed
but
unkind
now
damn
it
dauber
said
the
mate
look
out
or
be
over
the
side
the
water
freed
each
clanging
became
a
spout
the
men
cleared
up
the
decks
as
there
was
need
the
head
was
cut
he
felt
it
bleed
into
his
oilskins
as
he
clutched
and
coiled
water
and
sky
were
brews
which
boiled
boiled
shrieked
and
glowered
but
the
ship
was
saved
snugged
safely
down
though
fourteen
sails
were
split
out
of
the
dark
a
fiercer
fury
raved
the
died
and
mounted
each
crest
lit
with
a
white
toppling
gleam
that
hissed
from
it
and
slid
or
leaped
or
ran
with
whirls
of
cloud
mad
with
inhuman
life
that
shrieked
aloud
the
watch
was
called
dauber
might
go
below
splice
the
main
brace
the
mate
called
all
laid
aft
to
get
a
gulp
of
momentary
glow
as
some
reward
for
having
saved
the
craft
the
steward
ladled
mugs
from
which
each
whisky
with
water
sugar
and
hot
a
quarter
of
a
pint
each
made
the
tot
beside
the
door
the
steward
stood
ladling
it
out
and
each
man
came
in
turn
tipped
his
drank
it
grunted
good
and
shambled
forward
letting
it
slowly
burn
when
all
were
gone
the
dauber
lagged
astern
torn
by
his
frozen
lust
for
heat
the
pleasant
smell
so
warm
so
sweet
and
by
a
promise
long
since
made
at
home
never
to
taste
strong
liquor
now
he
knew
the
worth
of
liquor
now
he
wanted
some
his
frozen
body
urged
him
to
the
brew
yet
it
seemed
wrong
an
evil
thing
to
do
to
break
that
promise
dauber
said
the
mate
drink
and
turn
in
man
why
the
hell
wait
please
sir
temperance
temperance
are
you
hey
all
the
more
for
me
so
for
slops
i
thought
had
enough
slops
for
today
go
to
your
bunk
and
ease
her
when
she
drops
and
damme
steward
you
brew
with
too
much
hops
stir
up
the
sugar
man
and
tell
your
girl
how
kind
the
mate
was
teaching
you
to
furl
then
the
mate
drank
the
remnants
six
share
and
ramped
into
his
cabin
where
he
stripped
and
danced
unclad
and
was
uproarious
there
in
waltzes
with
the
cabin
cat
he
tripped
singing
in
tenor
clear
that
he
was
pipped
that
he
who
strove
the
tempest
to
disarm
must
never
first
embrail
the
lee
yardarm
and
that
his
name
was
ginger
dauber
crept
back
to
the
gripping
by
the
rail
the
wind
howled
by
the
passionate
water
leapt
the
night
was
all
one
roaring
with
the
gale
then
at
the
door
he
stopped
uttering
a
wail
his
hands
were
perished
numb
and
blue
as
veins
he
could
not
turn
the
knob
for
both
the
spains
a
hand
came
shuffling
aft
dodging
the
seas
singing
her
hair
between
his
teeth
taking
the
tumult
at
his
ease
even
when
the
wash
about
his
thighs
did
seethe
his
soul
was
happy
in
its
happy
sheath
what
dauber
it
open
fingers
cold
talk
of
this
time
dauber
when
old
he
flung
the
door
half
open
and
a
sea
washed
them
both
in
over
the
splashboard
down
silly
salt
miscarriage
sputtered
he
dauber
pull
out
the
plug
before
we
drown
spoiled
my
laces
and
my
velvet
gown
where
is
the
plug
groping
in
pitch
dark
water
he
sang
between
his
teeth
the
daughter
it
was
pitch
dark
within
there
at
each
roll
the
chests
slid
to
the
slant
the
water
rushed
making
full
many
a
clanging
tin
pan
bowl
into
the
black
as
it
gushed
the
men
slept
through
it
they
were
hushed
the
water
drained
and
then
with
matches
damp
the
man
struck
heads
off
till
he
lit
the
lamp
thank
you
the
dauber
said
the
seaman
grinned
this
is
your
first
foul
weather
yes
i
thought
up
on
the
yard
you
seen
much
wind
rotten
dauber
that
you
brought
now
i
must
cut
on
deck
before
caught
he
went
the
smoked
he
slammed
the
door
a
film
of
water
loitered
across
the
floor
the
dauber
watched
it
come
and
watched
it
go
he
had
had
revelation
of
the
lies
cloaking
the
truth
men
never
choose
to
know
he
could
bear
witness
now
and
cleanse
their
eyes
he
had
beheld
in
suffering
he
was
wise
this
was
the
sea
this
searcher
of
the
soul
this
shriek
fresh
from
the
pole
he
shook
with
cold
his
hands
could
not
undo
his
oilskin
buttons
so
he
shook
and
sat
watching
his
dirty
fingers
dirty
blue
hearing
without
the
hammering
tackle
slat
within
the
drops
from
dripping
clothes
went
pat
running
in
little
patters
gentle
sweet
and
ai
ai
went
the
wind
and
the
seas
beat
his
bunk
was
sopping
wet
he
clambered
in
none
of
his
clothes
were
dry
his
fear
recurred
cramps
bunched
the
muscles
underneath
his
skin
the
great
ship
rolled
until
the
lamp
was
blurred
he
took
his
bible
and
tried
to
read
a
word
trembled
at
going
aloft
again
and
then
resolved
to
fight
it
out
and
show
it
to
men
faces
recurred
fierce
memories
of
the
yard
the
frozen
sail
the
savage
eyes
the
jests
the
oaths
of
one
great
seaman
the
tug
of
leeches
jammed
beneath
their
chests
the
buntlines
bellying
bunts
out
into
breasts
the
deck
so
the
sky
so
wild
he
fell
asleep
and
slept
like
a
young
child
but
not
for
long
the
cold
awoke
him
soon
the
and
the
and
the
cramp
the
seas
thundering
without
the
wild
tune
the
sopping
misery
of
the
blankets
damp
a
roared
a
stamp
clogged
at
the
door
a
man
entered
to
shout
all
hands
on
deck
arouse
here
tumble
out
the
caller
raised
the
lamp
his
oilskins
clicked
as
the
thin
ice
upon
them
cracked
and
fell
rouse
out
he
said
this
lamp
is
frozen
rouse
out
his
accent
deepened
to
a
yell
among
ice
blowing
up
like
hell
going
to
hand
both
topsails
time
i
guess
sheeted
up
rouse
out
stay
to
dress
is
it
cold
on
deck
said
dauber
is
it
cold
sheeted
up
i
tell
you
inches
thick
the
like
a
told
now
tumble
out
my
sons
on
deck
here
quick
rouse
out
away
and
come
and
climb
the
stick
going
to
call
the
bosun
hey
both
topsails
coming
in
heave
out
away
he
went
the
dauber
tumbled
from
his
bunk
clutching
the
side
he
heard
the
wind
go
past
making
the
great
ship
wallow
as
if
drunk
there
was
a
shocking
tumult
up
the
mast
this
is
the
end
he
muttered
come
at
last
got
to
go
aloft
facing
this
cold
i
i
never
keep
my
hold
i
can
not
face
the
topsail
yard
again
i
never
guessed
what
misery
it
would
be
the
cramps
and
made
him
sick
with
pain
the
ship
stopped
suddenly
from
a
devilish
sea
then
with
a
triumph
of
wash
a
rush
of
glee
the
door
burst
in
and
in
the
water
rolled
filling
the
lower
bunks
black
creaming
cold
the
lamp
sucked
out
wash
went
the
water
back
then
in
again
flooding
the
bosun
swore
you
useless
thing
you
dauber
you
lee
slack
get
out
you
heekapoota
shut
the
door
you
what
are
you
waiting
for
out
of
my
way
you
thing
you
useless
thing
he
slammed
the
door
indignant
clanging
the
ring
and
then
he
lit
the
lamp
drowned
to
the
waist
a
fine
house
get
at
the
he
bent
against
it
as
the
water
raced
and
pull
them
out
to
leeward
when
she
rolls
they
say
some
kinds
of
landsmen
have
souls
i
well
believe
a
port
mahon
baboon
would
make
more
soul
than
you
got
with
a
spoon
down
in
the
icy
water
dauber
groped
to
find
the
plug
the
racing
water
sluiced
over
his
head
and
shoulders
as
she
sloped
without
judged
by
the
sound
all
hell
was
loosed
he
felt
cold
death
about
him
tightly
noosed
that
death
was
better
than
the
misery
there
iced
on
the
quaking
foothold
high
in
air
and
then
the
thought
came
a
failure
all
my
life
has
been
a
failure
they
were
right
it
will
not
matter
if
i
go
and
fall
i
should
be
free
then
from
this
delight
never
paint
best
let
it
end
slip
over
the
side
tried
and
failed
so
in
the
in
the
night
he
quailed
death
would
be
better
death
than
this
long
hell
of
mockery
and
surrender
and
dismay
this
long
defeat
of
doing
nothing
well
playing
the
part
too
high
for
him
to
play
o
death
who
hides
the
sorry
thing
away
take
me
failed
i
can
not
play
these
cards
there
came
a
thundering
from
the
topsail
yards
and
then
he
bit
his
lips
clenching
his
mind
and
staggered
out
to
muster
beating
back
the
coward
frozen
self
of
him
that
whined
come
what
cards
might
he
meant
to
play
the
pack
ai
screamed
the
wind
the
topsail
sheet
went
clack
ice
filled
the
air
with
spikes
the
burst
dauber
said
the
mate
on
deck
the
first
why
holy
sailor
dauber
a
man
i
took
you
for
a
soldier
up
now
come
up
on
the
yards
already
they
began
that
battle
with
a
gale
which
strikes
men
dumb
the
leaping
topsail
thundered
like
a
drum
the
frozen
snow
beat
in
the
face
like
shots
the
wind
spun
whipping
into
clots
so
up
upon
the
topsail
yard
again
in
the
great
fiercest
hour
began
probation
to
the
soul
of
pain
which
crowds
a
torment
in
a
span
for
the
next
month
the
ocean
taught
this
man
and
he
in
that
torment
while
she
wested
was
never
warm
nor
dry
nor
full
nor
rested
but
still
it
blew
or
if
it
lulled
it
rose
within
the
hour
and
blew
again
and
still
the
water
as
it
burst
aboard
her
froze
the
wind
blew
off
an
raw
and
chill
daunting
body
tampering
with
his
will
but
after
thirty
days
a
ghostly
sun
gave
sickly
promise
that
the
storms
were
done
vii
a
great
grey
sea
was
running
up
the
sky
desolate
birds
flew
past
their
mewings
came
as
that
lone
spiritual
cry
its
forlorn
voice
its
essence
its
name
the
ship
limped
in
the
water
as
if
lame
then
in
the
forenoon
watch
to
a
great
shout
more
sail
was
made
the
reefs
were
shaken
out
a
slant
came
from
the
south
the
singers
stood
clapped
to
the
halliards
hauling
to
a
tune
old
as
the
sea
a
fillip
to
the
blood
the
upper
topsail
rose
like
a
balloon
so
long
cape
stiff
in
valparaiso
soon
said
one
to
other
as
the
ship
lay
over
making
her
course
again
again
a
rover
slowly
the
sea
went
down
as
the
wind
fell
clear
rang
the
songs
hurrah
cape
horn
is
bet
the
combless
seas
were
lumping
into
swell
the
leaking
were
no
longer
wet
more
sail
was
made
the
watch
on
deck
was
set
to
cleaning
up
the
ruin
broken
bare
below
aloft
about
her
everywhere
the
dauber
scrubbing
out
the
roundhouse
found
old
pantiles
pulped
among
the
mouldy
gear
washed
underneath
the
bunks
and
long
since
drowned
during
the
agony
of
the
cape
horn
year
he
sang
in
scrubbing
for
he
had
done
with
fear
fronted
the
worst
and
looked
it
in
the
face
he
had
got
manhood
at
the
singing
he
scrubbed
passing
his
watch
below
making
the
fair
the
bosun
watched
bringing
his
knitting
slowly
to
the
toe
sails
stretched
a
mizen
skysail
which
he
patched
they
thought
the
dauber
was
a
bad
egg
hatched
daubs
said
the
bosun
cheerly
can
you
knit
made
a
bull
of
this
last
bit
then
while
the
dauber
counted
bosun
took
some
marline
from
his
pocket
here
he
said
you
want
to
know
square
sennit
so
fash
look
eight
foxes
take
and
stop
the
ends
with
thread
known
an
engineer
would
give
his
head
to
know
square
sennit
as
the
bose
began
the
dauber
felt
promoted
into
man
it
was
his
warrant
that
he
had
not
failed
that
the
most
hard
part
in
his
difficult
climb
had
not
been
past
attainment
it
was
scaled
safe
footing
showed
above
the
slippery
slime
he
had
emerged
out
of
the
iron
time
and
knew
that
he
could
compass
his
scheme
he
had
the
power
sufficient
to
his
dream
then
dinner
came
and
now
the
sky
was
blue
the
ship
was
standing
north
the
horn
was
rounded
she
made
a
thundering
as
she
weltered
through
the
mighty
glittered
as
she
bounded
more
sail
was
piled
upon
her
she
was
hounded
north
while
the
wind
came
like
a
stag
she
ran
over
grey
hills
and
hollows
of
seas
wan
she
had
a
white
bone
in
her
mouth
she
sped
those
in
the
watched
her
as
they
ate
their
meal
of
fried
with
broken
bread
good
old
they
cried
off
gathering
gait
her
track
was
whitening
like
a
lammas
spate
good
old
they
cried
oh
give
her
cloth
hurray
for
three
weeks
more
to
valparaiso
bay
she
smells
old
vallipo
the
bosun
cried
be
inside
the
tier
in
three
weeks
more
lying
at
where
they
ride
off
of
the
market
half
a
mile
from
shore
and
bumboat
pan
my
sons
and
figs
galore
and
girls
in
black
mantillas
fit
to
make
a
poor
seaman
frantic
when
they
dance
the
cueca
eight
bells
were
made
the
watch
was
changed
and
now
the
mate
spoke
to
the
dauber
this
is
better
soon
be
getting
mudhooks
over
the
bow
make
her
passage
still
if
let
her
oh
run
you
drogher
dip
your
wetter
well
dauber
this
is
better
than
cape
horn
them
topsails
made
you
wish
not
been
born
yes
sir
the
dauber
said
now
said
the
mate
got
to
smart
her
up
them
cape
horn
seas
have
made
her
like
a
rusty
grate
oh
them
topsails
make
your
fishhooks
freeze
a
topsail
pay
heed
to
you
please
well
you
have
seen
cape
horn
my
son
learned
dipped
your
hand
and
had
your
fingers
burned
and
now
stow
that
folly
trying
to
paint
had
your
lesson
a
sailor
now
you
come
on
board
a
female
ripe
to
faint
all
sorts
of
slush
learned
the
lord
knows
how
cape
horn
has
sent
you
wisdom
over
the
bow
if
got
sense
to
take
it
a
sailor
my
god
before
you
were
a
tailor
so
throw
your
paints
to
blazes
and
have
done
words
describe
the
silly
things
you
did
sitting
before
your
easel
in
the
sun
with
all
your
colours
on
the
lid
i
blushed
for
you
and
then
the
daubs
you
hid
my
god
have
more
sense
now
eh
quit
no
sir
not
no
sir
god
give
you
wit
i
thought
come
to
wisdom
thus
they
talked
while
the
great
clipper
took
her
bit
and
rushed
like
a
stallion
not
yet
baulked
till
water
at
her
swing
ports
gushed
poising
and
bowing
down
her
crushed
bubble
on
glittering
bubble
on
she
went
the
dauber
watched
her
wondering
what
it
meant
to
come
after
long
months
at
rosy
dawn
into
the
placid
blue
of
some
great
bay
treading
the
quiet
water
like
a
fawn
ere
yet
the
morning
haze
was
blown
away
a
figure
putting
by
the
grey
and
anchoring
there
before
the
city
smoke
rose
or
the
rang
or
men
awoke
and
then
in
the
first
light
to
see
grow
clear
that
haven
filled
with
strangers
alive
with
men
and
women
see
and
hear
its
clattering
market
and
its
and
hear
the
surf
beat
and
be
free
from
dangers
and
watch
the
crinkled
ocean
blue
with
calm
drowsing
beneath
the
trade
beneath
the
palm
hungry
for
that
he
worked
the
hour
went
by
and
still
the
wind
grew
still
the
clipper
strode
and
now
a
darkness
hid
the
western
sky
and
sprays
came
flicking
off
at
the
goad
she
stumbled
now
feeling
her
sail
a
load
the
mate
gazed
hard
to
windward
eyed
his
sail
and
said
the
horn
was
going
to
flick
her
tail
boldly
he
kept
it
on
her
till
she
staggered
but
still
the
wind
increased
it
grew
it
grew
darkening
the
sky
making
the
water
haggard
full
of
small
snow
the
mighty
wester
blew
more
fun
for
little
sighed
the
crew
they
eyed
the
taut
topgallants
stiff
like
steel
a
second
hand
was
ordered
to
the
wheel
the
captain
eyed
her
aft
sucking
his
lip
feeling
the
sail
too
much
but
yet
refraining
from
putting
hobbles
on
the
leaping
ship
the
glad
stallion
uproarious
and
complaining
but
in
a
gust
he
cocked
his
finger
so
better
take
them
off
before
they
go
all
saw
they
ran
at
once
without
the
word
loud
rang
the
cries
sam
in
his
bunk
within
the
heard
stirred
in
his
sleep
and
rubbed
his
drowsy
eyes
there
go
the
lower
against
the
skies
rose
the
thin
bellying
strips
of
leaping
sail
the
dauber
was
the
first
man
over
the
rail
three
to
a
mast
they
ran
it
was
a
race
god
said
the
mate
that
dauber
he
can
go
he
watched
the
runners
with
an
upturned
face
over
the
futtocks
struggling
heel
to
toe
up
to
the
topmast
into
the
blow
where
the
three
sails
were
leaping
dauber
wins
the
yards
were
reached
and
now
the
race
begins
which
three
will
furl
their
sail
first
and
come
down
out
to
the
for
the
leech
goes
one
his
hair
blown
flagwise
from
a
hatless
crown
his
hands
at
work
like
fever
to
be
done
out
of
the
gale
a
fiercer
fury
spun
the
three
sails
leaped
together
yanking
high
like
talons
darting
up
to
clutch
the
sky
the
dauber
on
the
yard
out
at
the
weather
was
the
first
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
topgallant
yanking
to
the
burst
he
craned
to
catch
the
leech
his
comrades
cursed
one
at
the
buntlines
one
with
oaths
observed
the
eye
of
the
outer
served
no
said
the
dauber
no
the
man
replied
they
heaved
stowing
the
sail
not
looking
round
panting
but
full
of
life
and
the
gale
roared
at
them
with
its
iron
sound
you
the
dauber
said
his
gasket
wound
swift
round
the
yard
binding
the
sail
in
bands
there
came
a
gust
the
sail
leaped
from
his
hands
so
that
he
saw
it
high
above
him
grey
and
there
his
mate
was
falling
quick
he
clutched
an
arm
in
oilskins
swiftly
snatched
away
a
voice
said
christ
a
quick
shape
stooped
and
touched
chain
struck
his
hands
ropes
shot
the
sky
was
smutched
with
vast
black
fires
that
ran
that
fell
that
furled
and
then
he
saw
the
mast
the
small
snow
hurled
the
yard
far
far
aloft
and
blankness
settling
on
him
and
great
pain
and
snow
beneath
his
fingers
wet
and
soft
and
topsail
shaking
at
the
chain
he
knew
it
was
he
who
had
fallen
then
his
brain
swirled
in
a
circle
while
he
watched
the
sky
infinite
multitudes
of
snow
blew
by
i
thought
it
was
tom
who
fell
his
voice
said
down
on
the
bloody
deck
the
captain
screamed
the
multitudinous
little
sped
his
pain
was
real
enough
but
all
else
seemed
si
with
a
bucket
ran
the
water
gleamed
tilting
upon
him
others
came
the
mate
they
knelt
with
eager
eyes
like
things
that
wait
for
other
things
to
come
he
saw
them
there
it
will
go
on
he
murmured
watching
si
colours
and
sounds
seemed
mixing
in
the
air
the
pain
was
stunning
him
and
the
wind
went
by
more
water
said
the
mate
here
bosun
try
ask
if
got
a
message
hell
gone
here
dauber
paints
he
said
it
will
go
on
not
knowing
his
meaning
rightly
but
he
spoke
with
the
intenseness
of
a
fading
soul
whose
share
of
fire
turns
to
smoke
whose
hand
on
wheel
loses
control
the
eager
faces
glowered
red
like
coal
they
glowed
the
great
storm
glowed
the
sails
the
mast
it
will
go
on
he
cried
aloud
and
passed
those
from
the
yard
came
down
to
tell
the
tale
he
almost
had
me
off
said
tom
he
slipped
there
come
one
hell
of
a
from
the
sail
he
clutched
at
me
and
almost
had
me
pipped
he
caught
my
but
the
oilskin
ripped
it
tore
clean
off
look
here
i
was
near
gone
i
made
a
grab
to
catch
him
so
did
john
i
caught
his
arm
my
god
i
was
near
done
he
almost
had
me
over
it
was
near
he
hit
the
ropes
and
grabbed
at
every
one
well
said
the
mate
we
can
not
leave
him
here
run
si
and
get
the
table
clear
lay
him
there
catch
hold
there
you
and
you
dead
poor
son
nothing
more
to
do
night
fell
and
all
night
long
the
dauber
lay
covered
upon
the
table
all
night
long
the
pitiless
storm
exulted
at
her
prey
huddling
the
waters
with
her
icy
thong
but
to
the
covered
shape
she
did
no
wrong
he
lay
beneath
the
sailcloth
bell
by
bell
the
night
wore
through
the
stars
rose
the
stars
fell
blowing
most
pitiless
cold
out
of
clear
sky
the
wind
roared
all
night
long
and
all
night
through
the
green
seas
on
the
deck
went
washing
by
flooding
the
bitter
hard
it
blew
but
little
of
it
all
the
dauber
knew
the
sopping
bunks
the
floating
chests
the
wet
the
darkness
and
the
misery
and
the
sweat
he
was
off
duty
so
it
blew
all
night
and
when
the
watches
changed
the
men
would
come
dripping
within
the
door
to
strike
a
light
and
stare
upon
the
dauber
lying
dumb
and
say
he
come
a
cruel
thump
poor
chum
or
a
fine
big
man
or
he
a
smart
young
seaman
he
was
getting
to
be
or
damn
it
all
what
all
to
face
i
knew
another
fellow
one
time
then
came
a
strange
tale
of
death
in
a
strange
place
out
on
the
sea
in
ships
with
wandering
men
in
many
ways
death
puts
us
into
pen
the
reefers
came
down
tired
and
looked
and
slept
below
the
skylight
little
dribbles
crept
along
the
painted
woodwork
glistening
slow
following
the
roll
and
dripping
never
fast
but
dripping
on
the
quiet
form
below
like
passing
time
talking
to
time
long
past
and
all
night
long
ai
ai
went
the
blast
and
creaming
water
swished
below
the
pale
unheeding
body
stretched
beneath
the
sail
at
dawn
they
sewed
him
up
and
at
eight
bells
they
bore
him
to
the
gangway
wading
deep
through
the
that
flung
his
carriers
over
in
their
sweep
they
laid
an
old
red
ensign
on
the
heap
and
all
hands
stood
stooping
swaying
washed
by
the
sea
while
the
old
man
was
praying
out
of
a
borrowed
at
a
sign
they
twitched
the
ensign
back
and
tipped
the
grating
a
creamier
bubbling
broke
the
bubbling
brine
the
muffled
figure
tilted
to
the
weighting
it
dwindled
slowly
down
slowly
gyrating
some
craned
to
see
it
dimmed
it
disappeared
the
last
green
milky
bubble
blinked
and
cleared
mister
shake
out
your
reefs
the
captain
called
out
topsail
reefs
the
mate
cried
then
all
hands
hurried
the
great
sails
shook
and
all
hands
hauled
singing
that
desolate
song
of
lonely
lands
of
how
a
lover
came
in
dripping
bands
green
with
the
wet
and
cold
to
tell
his
lover
that
death
was
in
the
sea
and
all
was
over
fair
came
the
falling
wind
a
seaman
said
the
dauber
was
a
jonah
once
again
the
clipper
held
her
course
showing
red
lead
shattering
the
into
golden
rain
the
waves
bowed
down
before
her
like
blown
grain
onwards
she
thundered
on
her
voyage
was
short
before
the
bells
rang
her
into
port
cheerly
they
rang
her
in
those
beating
bells
the
beauty
stately
from
the
sea
whitening
the
blue
heave
of
the
drowsy
swells
treading
the
bubbles
down
with
three
times
three
they
cheered
her
moving
beauty
in
and
she
came
to
her
berth
so
noble
so
superb
swayed
like
a
queen
and
answered
to
the
curb
then
in
the
flush
they
went
aloft
and
unbent
sails
in
that
most
lovely
hour
when
the
light
gentles
and
the
wind
is
soft
and
beauty
in
the
heart
breaks
like
a
flower
working
aloft
they
saw
the
mountain
tower
snow
to
the
peak
they
heard
the
shout
and
bright
along
the
bay
the
lights
came
out
and
then
the
night
fell
dark
and
all
night
long
the
pointed
mountain
pointed
at
the
stars
frozen
alert
austere
the
song
screamed
from
her
desolate
screes
and
splintered
scars
on
her
intense
crags
where
the
air
is
sparse
the
stars
looked
down
their
many
golden
eyes
watched
her
and
burned
burned
out
and
came
to
rise
silent
the
finger
of
the
summit
stood
icy
in
pure
thin
air
glittering
with
snows
then
the
coming
turned
the
peak
to
blood

in

the

arose

dates
and
facts
and
long
before
this
wandering
flesh
is
rotten
the
dates
which
made
me
will
be
all
forgotten
and
none
will
know
the
gleam
there
used
to
be
about
the
feast
days
freshly
kept
by
me
but
men
will
call
the
golden
hour
of
bliss
about
this
time
or
shortly
after
this
men
do
not
heed
the
rungs
by
which
men
climb
those
glittering
steps
those
milestones
upon
time
those
tombstones
of
dead
selves
those
hours
of
birth
those
moments
of
the
soul
in
years
of
earth
they
mark
the
height
achieved
the
main
result
the
power
of
freedom
in
the
perished
cult
the
power
of
boredom
in
the
dead
deeds
not
the
bright
moments
of
the
sprinkled
seeds
by
many
waters
and
on
many
ways
i
have
known
golden
instants
and
bright
days
the
day
on
which
beneath
an
arching
sail
i
saw
the
cordilleras
and
gave
hail
the
summer
day
on
which
in
delight
i
saw
the
swansea
mumbles
bursting
white
the
glittering
day
when
all
the
waves
wore
flags
and
the
ship
came
with
sails
in
rags
that
time
in
irish
dusk
when
life
became
more
splendid
than
its
husk
when
the
rent
chapel
on
the
brae
at
slains
shone
with
a
doorway
opening
beyond
brains
the
dawn
when
with
a
creaking
cry
out
of
the
mist
a
little
barque
slipped
by
spilling
the
mist
with
changing
gleams
of
red
then
gone
with
one
raised
hand
and
one
turned
head
the
howling
evening
when
the
mists
broke
to
display
the
four
evangelists
divinely
granite
lashed
by
breakers
bones
of
long
since
buried
acres
the
night
alone
near
water
when
i
heard
all
the
spirit
spoken
by
a
bird
the
english
dusk
when
i
beheld
once
more
with
eyes
so
changed
the
ship
the
citied
shore
the
lines
of
masts
the
streets
so
cheerly
trod
in
happier
seasons
and
gave
thanks
to
god
all
had
their
beauty
then
bright
gift
their
something
caught
from
time
the
all
of
those
gleams
were
golden
but
hands
have
given
more
constant
gifts
in
changing
lands
and
when
i
count
those
gifts
i
think
them
such
as
no
bounty
could
have
bettered
much
the
gift
of
country
life
near
hills
and
woods
where
happy
waters
sing
in
solitudes
the
gift
of
being
near
ships
of
seeing
each
day
a
city
of
ships
with
great
ships
under
weigh
the
great
street
paved
with
water
filled
with
shipping
and
all
the
flags
flying
and
seagulls
dipping
yet
when
i
am
dust
my
penman
may
not
know
those
ships
which
made
me
glow
but
think
my
wonder
mad
and
fail
to
find
their
glory
even
dimly
from
my
mind
and
yet
they
made
me
not
alone
the
ships
but
men
from
to
whips
the
two
close
friends
of
nearly
twenty
years
both
and
whose
feet
with
mine
wore
many
a
bright
treading
the
decks
beneath
the
riding
light
yet
death
will
make
that
warmth
of
friendship
cold
and
know
what
one
said
and
what
one
told
our
communion
and
the
broken
spells
when
the
loud
call
blew
at
the
strike
of
bells
no
one
i
know
yet
let
me
be
believed
a
soul
entirely
known
is
life
achieved
years
blank
with
hardship
never
speak
a
word
live
in
the
soul
to
make
the
being
stirred
towns
can
be
prisons
where
the
spirit
dulls
away
from
mates
and
hulls
away
from
all
bright
water
and
great
hills
and
where
the
curlews
cry
their
fills
away
in
towns
where
eyes
have
nought
to
see
but
dead
museums
and
miles
of
misery
and
floating
life
unrooted
from
need
and
miles
of
baited
to
catch
greed
and
life
made
wretched
out
of
human
ken
and
miles
of
shopping
women
served
by
men
so
if
the
penman
sums
my
london
days
let
him
but
say
that
there
were
holy
ways
dull
bloomsbury
streets
of
dull
brick
mansions
old
with
stinking
doors
where
women
stood
to
scold
and
drunken
waits
at
christmas
with
their
horn
droning
the
news
in
snow
that
christ
was
born
and
windy
gas
lamps
and
the
wet
roads
shining
and
that
old
carol
of
the
midnight
whining
and
that
old
room
above
the
noisy
slum
where
there
was
wine
and
fire
and
talk
with
some
under
strange
pictures
of
the
wakened
soul
to
whom
this
earth
was
but
a
coal
o
time
bring
back
those
midnights
and
those
friends
those
glittering
moments
that
a
spirit
lends
that
all
may
be
imagined
from
the
flash
the
through
the
lightning
gash
those
hours
of
stricken
sparks
from
which
men
took
light
to
send
out
to
men
in
song
or
book
those
friends
who
heard
bells
strike
two
yet
stayed
until
the
cockerel
crew
talking
of
noble
styles
the
best
the
thought
beyond
great
poets
not
expressed
the
glory
of
mood
where
human
frailty
failed
the
forts
of
human
light
not
yet
assailed
till
the
dim
room
had
mind
and
seemed
to
brood
binding
our
wills
to
mental
brotherhood
till
we
became
a
college
and
each
night
was
discipline
and
manhood
and
delight
till
our
farewells
and
winding
down
the
stairs
at
each
grey
dawn
had
meaning
that
time
spares
that
we
so
linked
should
roam
the
whole
world
round
teaching
the
ways
our
brooding
minds
had
found
making
that
room
our
chapter
our
one
mind
where
all
that
this
world
soiled
should
be
refined
often
at
night
i
tread
those
streets
again
and
see
the
alley
glimmering
in
the
rain
yet
now
i
miss
that
sign
of
earlier
tramps
a
house
with
shadows
of
under
lamps
the
secret
house
where
once
a
beggar
stood
trembling
and
blind
to
show
his
woe
for
food
and
now
i
miss
that
friend
who
used
to
walk
home
to
my
lodgings
with
me
deep
in
talk
wearing
the
last
of
night
out
in
still
streets
trodden
by
us
and
policemen
on
their
beats
and
cats
but
else
deserted
now
i
miss
that
lively
mind
and
guttural
laugh
of
his
and
that
strange
way
he
had
of
making
gleam
like
something
real
the
art
we
used
to
dream
london
has
been
my
prison
but
my
books
hills
and
great
waters
labouring
men
and
brooks
ships
and
deep
friendships
and
remembered
days
which
even
now
set
all
my
mind
ablaze
as
that
june
day
when
in
the
red
chinks
i
saw
the
old
roman
ruins
white
with
pinks
and
felt
the
hillside
haunted
even
then
by
not
dead
memory
of
the
roman
men
and
felt
the
hillside
thronged
by
souls
unseen
who
knew
the
interest
in
me
and
were
keen
that
man
alive
should
understand
man
dead
so
many
centuries
since
the
blood
was
shed
and
quickened
with
strange
hush
because
this
comer
sensed
a
strange
soul
alive
behind
the
summer
that
other
day
on
ercall
when
the
stones
were
sunbleached
white
like
long
unburied
bones
while
the
bees
droned
and
all
the
air
was
sweet
from
honey
buried
underneath
my
feet
honey
of
purple
heather
and
white
clover
sealed
in
its
gummy
bags
till
over
then
other
days
by
water
by
bright
sea
clear
as
clean
glass
and
my
bright
friend
with
me
the
cove
clean
bottomed
where
we
saw
the
brown
red
spotted
plaice
go
skimming
six
feet
down
and
saw
the
long
fronds
waving
white
with
shells
waving
unfolding
drooping
to
the
swells
that
sadder
day
when
we
beheld
the
great
and
terrible
beauty
of
a
lammas
spate
roaring
in
all
the
great
gaps
headlong
fury
of
collapse
while
drenching
clouds
drove
by
and
every
sense
was
water
roaring
or
rushing
or
in
offence
and
mountain
sheep
stood
huddled
and
blown
gaps
gleamed
where
torn
white
hair
of
torrents
shook
and
streamed
that
sadder
day
when
we
beheld
again
a
spate
going
down
in
sunshine
after
rain
when
the
blue
reach
of
water
leaping
bright
was
one
long
ripple
and
clatter
flecked
with
white
and
that
far
day
that
never
blotted
page
when
youth
was
bright
like
flowers
about
old
age
fair
generations
bringing
thanks
for
life
to
that
old
kindly
man
and
trembling
wife
after
their
sixty
years
time
never
made
a
better
beauty
since
the
earth
was
laid
than
that
thanksgiving
given
to
grey
hair
for
the
great
gift
of
life
which
brought
them
there
days
of
endeavour
have
been
good
the
days
racing
in
cutters
for
the
praise
the
day
they
led
my
cutter
at
the
turn
yet
could
not
keep
the
lead
and
dropped
astern
the
moment
in
the
spurt
when
both
oars
dipped
in
each
wash
and
throats
grew
hoarse
and
teeth
ground
into
teeth
and
both
strokes
quickened
lashing
the
sea
and
gasps
came
and
hearts
sickened
and
coxswains
damned
us
dancing
banking
stroke
to
put
our
weights
on
though
our
hearts
were
broke
and
both
boats
seemed
to
stick
and
sea
seemed
glue
the
tide
a
mill
race
we
were
struggling
through
and
every
quick
recover
gave
us
squints
of
them
still
there
and
oar
tossed
and
cheering
came
our
friends
our
foemen
cheering
a
long
wild
rallying
murmur
on
the
hearing
port
fore
and
starboard
fore
port
fore
port
fore
up
with
her
starboard
and
at
that
each
oar
lightened
though
arms
were
bursting
and
eyes
shut
and
the
oak
stretchers
grunted
in
the
strut
and
the
curse
quickened
from
the
cox
our
bows
crashed
and
drove
talking
water
we
made
vows
chastity
vows
and
temperance
in
our
pain
we
numbered
things
never
eat
again
if
we
could
only
win
then
came
the
yell
starboard
port
fore
and
then
a
beaten
bell
rung
as
for
fire
to
cheer
us
now
oars
bent
soul
took
the
looms
now
bolt
was
spent
damn
it
come
on
now
on
now
on
now
starboard
port
fore
up
with
her
port
each
cutter
harboured
ten
painsick
stragglers
heave
oh
heave
catcalls
waked
echoes
like
a
shrieking
sheave
heave
and
i
saw
a
back
then
two
port
fore
starboard
come
on
i
saw
the
midship
oar
and
knew
we
had
done
them
port
fore
starboard
now
i
saw
bright
water
spurting
at
their
bow
their
full
face
an
instant
they
were
done
the
cheering
almost
drowned
the
gun
we
had
hardly
strength
to
toss
our
oars
our
cry
cheering
the
losing
cutter
was
a
sigh
other
bright
days
of
action
have
seemed
great
wild
days
in
a
pampero
off
the
plate
good
swimming
days
at
hog
back
or
the
coves
which
the
young
gannet
and
the
corbie
loves
between
rollers
catching
breath
between
the
advancing
grave
and
breaking
death
then
shooting
up
into
the
sunbright
smooth
to
watch
the
advancing
roller
bare
her
tooth
and
days
of
labour
also
loading
hauling
long
days
at
winch
or
capstan
heaving
pawling
the
days
with
oxen
dragging
stone
from
blasting
and
dusty
days
in
mills
and
hot
days
masting
trucking
on
deckings
smooth
like
ice
and
hunts
in
mighty
after
mice
mornings
with
buckwheat
when
the
fields
did
blanch
with
white
leghorns
come
from
the
chicken
ranch
days
near
the
spring
upon
the
sunburnt
hill
plying
the
maul
or
gripping
tight
the
drill
delights
of
work
most
real
delights
that
change
the
headache
life
of
towns
to
rapture
strange
not
known
by
townsmen
nor
imagined
health
that
puts
new
glory
upon
mental
wealth
and
makes
the
poor
man
rich
but
that
ends
too
health
with
its
thoughts
of
life
and
that
bright
view
that
sunny
landscape
from
peak
that
glory
and
all
a
glad
comments
on
story
and
thoughts
of
marvellous
towns
and
living
men
and
what
pens
tell
and
all
beyond
the
pen
end
and
are
summed
in
words
so
truly
dead
they
raise
no
image
of
the
heart
and
head
the
life
the
man
alive
the
friend
we
knew
the
mind
ours
argued
with
or
listened
to
none
but
are
dead
and
all
keenness
all
is
dead
as
print
before
the
funeral
even
deader
after
when
the
dates
are
sought
and
cold
minds
disagree
with
what
we
thought
this
many
pictured
world
of
many
passions
wears
out
the
nations
as
a
woman
fashions
and
what
life
is
is
much
to
very
few
men
being
so
strange
so
mad
and
what
men
do
so
good
to
watch
or
share
but
when
men
count
those
hours
of
life
that
were
a
bursting
fount
sparkling
the
dusty
heart
with
living
springs
there
seems
a
world
beyond
our
earthly
things
gated
by
golden
moments
each
bright
time
opening
to
show
the
city
white
like
lime
high
towered
and
many
peopled
this
made
sure
work
that
obscures
those
moments
seems
impure
making
our
time
of
breath
dull
with
the
ritual
and
records
of
death
that
frost
of
fact
by
which
our
wisdom
gives
correctly
stated
death
to
all
that
lives
best
trust
the
happy
moments
what
they
gave
makes
man
less
fearful
of
the
certain
grave
and
gives
his
work
compassion
and
new
eyes
the
days
that
make
us
happy
make
us
wise
ships
i
can
not
tell
their
wonder
nor
make
known
magic
that
once
thrilled
through
me
to
the
bone
but
all
men
praise
some
beauty
tell
some
tale
vent
a
high
mood
which
makes
the
rest
seem
pale
pour
their
blood
to
flourish
one
green
leaf
follow
some
helen
for
her
gift
of
grief
and
fail
in
what
they
mean
they
do
you
should
have
seen
man
can
not
tell
to
you
the
beauty
of
the
ships
of
that
my
city
that
beauty
now
is
spoiled
by
the
pity
for
one
may
haunt
the
pier
a
score
of
times
hearing
nicholas
bells
ring
out
the
chimes
yet
never
see
those
proud
ones
swaying
home
with
mainyards
backed
and
bows
a
cream
of
foam
those
bows
so
cut
so
fine
those
coulters
of
the
brine
as
once
long
since
when
all
the
docks
were
filled
with
that
man
has
ceased
to
build
yet
though
their
splendour
may
have
ceased
to
be
each
played
her
sovereign
part
in
making
me
now
i
return
my
thanks
with
heart
and
lips
for
the
great
queenliness
of
all
those
ships
and
first
the
first
bright
memory
still
so
clear
an
autumn
evening
in
a
golden
year
when
in
the
last
lit
moments
before
dark
the
a
lovely
barque
came
to
an
anchor
near
us
on
the
flood
her
trucks
aloft
in
red
as
blood
then
come
so
many
ships
that
i
could
fill
three
docks
with
their
fair
hulls
remembered
still
each
with
her
special
special
grace
riding
the
sea
making
the
waves
give
place
to
delicate
high
beauty
best
strength
noble
in
every
line
in
all
their
length
ships
with
long
jibbooms
the
with
great
beauty
and
strange
dooms
mightiest
then
superb
sublime
the
huge
as
slow
as
time
the
swift
the
perfect
the
loveliest
barque
my
city
has
sent
forth
dainty
well
remembered
yet
the
splendid
with
her
skysail
set
stalwart
majestic
divine
bright
ships
the
and
their
sweet
sisters
of
the
fernie
fleet
in
whom
my
friend
died
and
the
old
long
since
loved
long
since
sold
passed
in
rio
spoken
burnt
the
in
whom
my
friend
sailed
trim
plunging
to
the
swim
sweet
tall
queen
in
all
harbours
with
her
moon
sail
yard
though
i
tell
many
there
must
still
be
others
mcvickar
ships
and
fernie
the
countless
lines
whose
all
were
once
familiar
signs
at
high
on
windy
ways
when
sunlight
made
the
water
blaze
their
names
bring
back
old
mornings
when
the
docks
shone
with
their
and
their
painted
blocks
their
raking
masts
below
the
custom
house
and
all
the
marvellous
beauty
of
their
bows
familiar
steamers
too
majestic
steamers
shearing
atlantic
to
streamers
noble
still
at
sea
the
grandest
then
that
man
had
brought
to
be
of
of
forever
jealous
racers
out
and
home
the
blue
down
the
stream
the
fair
with
her
bows
booth
liners
anchor
liners
red
star
liners
the
marks
and
styles
of
countless
the
lost
all
well
known
to
me
these
splendid
ships
each
with
her
grace
her
glory
her
memory
of
old
song
or
story
still
in
my
mind
the
image
of
need
beauty
in
hardest
action
beauty
indeed
they
built
great
ships
and
sailed
them
sounds
most
brave
whatever
arts
we
have
or
fail
to
have
i
touch
my
mind
i
come
to
grips
with
half
her
purpose
thinking
of
these
ships
that
art
untouched
by
softness
all
that
line
drawn
ringing
hard
to
stand
the
test
of
brine
that
nobleness
and
grandeur
all
that
beauty
born
of
a
manly
life
and
bitter
duty
that
splendour
of
fine
bows
which
yet
could
stand
the
shock
of
rollers
never
checked
by
land
that
art
of
masts
sail
crowded
fit
to
break
yet
stayed
to
strength
and
backstayed
into
rake
the
life
demanded
by
that
art
the
keen
seamen
silent
lean
they
are
grander
things
than
all
the
art
of
towns
their
tests
are
tempests
and
the
sea
that
drowns
they
are
my
line
her
great
art
done
by
strong
brains
labouring
on
the
thought
unwon
they
mark
our
passage
as
a
race
of
men
earth
will
not
see
such
ships
as
those
again
truth
man
with
his
burning
soul
has
but
an
hour
of
breath
to
build
a
ship
of
truth
in
which
his
soul
may
sail
sail
on
the
sea
of
death
for
death
takes
toll
of
beauty
courage
youth
of
all
but
truth
city
ways
are
dark
men
mutter
by
the
wells
of
the
great
waters
moan
o
death
o
sea
o
tide
the
waters
moan
like
bells
no
light
no
mark
the
soul
goes
out
alone
on
seas
unknown
stripped
of
all
purple
robes
stripped
of
all
golden
lies
i
will
not
be
afraid
truth
will
preserve
through
death
perhaps
the
stars
will
rise
the
stars
like
globes
the
ship
my
striving
made
may
see
night
fade
they
closed
her
eyes
from
the
spanish
of
don
gustavo
bécquer
they
closed
her
eyes
they
were
still
open
they
hid
her
face
with
a
white
linen
and
some
sobbing
others
in
silence
from
the
sad
bedroom
all
came
away
the
in
a
dish
burned
on
the
floor
it
flung
on
the
wall
the
shadow
and
in
that
shadow
one
saw
sometimes
drawn
in
sharp
line
the
shape
the
day
awakened
at
its
first
whiteness
with
its
thousand
noises
the
town
awoke
before
that
contrast
of
life
and
strangeness
of
light
and
darkness
i
thought
a
moment
god
how
dead
are
from
the
house
to
church
they
bore
her
and
in
a
chapel
they
left
her
bier
there
they
surrounded
her
pale
body
with
yellow
candles
and
black
stuffs
at
the
last
stroke
of
the
ringing
for
the
souls
an
old
crone
finished
her
last
prayers
she
crossed
the
narrow
nave
the
doors
moaned
and
the
holy
place
remained
deserted
from
a
clock
one
heard
the
measured
ticking
and
from
some
candles
the
guttering
all
things
there
were
so
grim
and
sad
so
dark
and
rigid
that
i
thought
a
moment
god
how
dead
are
from
the
high
belfry
the
tongue
of
iron
clanged
giving
out
his
sad
farewell
crape
on
their
clothes
her
friends
and
kindred
passed
in
a
row
making
procession
in
the
last
vault
dark
and
narrow
the
pickaxe
opened
a
niche
at
one
end
there
they
laid
her
down
soon
they
bricked
the
place
up
and
with
a
gesture
bade
grief
farewell
pickaxe
on
shoulder
the
singing
between
his
teeth
passed
out
of
sight
the
night
came
down
it
was
all
silent
lost
in
the
shadows
i
thought
a
moment
god
how
dead
are
in
the
long
nights
of
bitter
winter
when
the
wind
makes
the
rafters
creak
when
the
violent
rain
lashes
the
windows
lonely
i
remember
that
poor
girl
there
falls
the
rain
with
its
noise
eternal
there
the
north
wind
fights
with
the
rain
stretched
in
the
hollow
of
the
damp
bricks
perhaps
her
bones
freeze
with
the
cold
does
the
dust
return
to
dust
does
the
soul
fly
to
heaven
is
all
vile
matter
rottenness
filthiness
i
know
not
but
there
is
something
something
that
i
can
not
explain
something
that
gives
us
loathing
terror
to
leave
the
dead
so
alone
so
wretched
the
harp
from
the
spanish
of
don
gustavo
bécquer
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
room
perhaps
forgotten
by
its
owner
silent
and
dim
with
dust
i
saw
the
harp
how
many
musics
slumbered
in
its
strings
as
the
bird
sleeps
in
the
branches
waiting
the
snowy
hand
that
could
awaken
them
ah
me
i
thought
how
many
many
times
genius
thus
slumbers
in
a
human
soul
waiting
as
lazarus
waited
for
a
voice
to
bid
him
rise
and
walk
sonnet
from
the
spanish
of
don
francisco
de
quevedo
i
saw
the
ramparts
of
my
native
land
one
time
so
strong
now
dropping
in
decay
their
strength
destroyed
by
this
new
way
that
has
worn
out
and
rotted
what
was
grand
i
went
into
the
fields
there
i
could
see
the
sun
drink
up
the
waters
newly
thawed
and
on
the
hills
the
moaning
cattle
pawed
their
miseries
robbed
the
day
of
light
for
me
i
went
into
my
house
i
saw
how
spotted
decaying
things
made
that
old
home
their
prize
my
withered
had
come
to
bend
i
felt
the
age
had
won
my
sword
was
rotted
and
there
was
nothing
on
which
i
set
my
eyes
that
was
not
a
reminder
of
the
end
sonnet
on
the
death
of
his
wife
from
the
portuguese
of
antonio
de
ferreiro
that
blessed
sunlight
that
once
showed
to
me
my
way
to
heaven
more
plain
more
certainly
and
with
her
bright
beam
banished
utterly
all
trace
of
mortal
sorrow
far
from
me
has
gone
from
me
has
left
her
prison
sad
and
i
am
blind
and
alone
and
gone
astray
like
a
lost
pilgrim
in
a
desert
way
wanting
the
blessed
guide
that
once
he
had
thus
with
a
spirit
bowed
and
mind
a
blur
i
trace
the
holy
steps
where
she
has
gone
by
valleys
and
by
meadows
and
by
mountains
and
everywhere
i
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
she
takes
me
by
the
hand
and
leads
me
on
and
my
eyes
follow
her
my
eyes
made
fountains
song
one
sunny
time
in
may
when
lambs
were
sporting
the
sap
ran
in
the
spray
and
i
went
courting
and
all
the
apple
boughs
were
bright
with
blossom
i
picked
an
early
rose
for
my
bosom
and
then
i
met
her
friend
down
by
the
water
who
cried
met
her
end
that
daughter
that
voice
of
hers
is
stilled
her
beauty
broken
o
me
my
love
is
killed
my
love
unspoken
she
was
too
sweet
too
dear
to
die
so
cruel
o
death
why
leave
me
here
and
take
my
jewel
her
voice
went
to
the
bone
so
true
so
ringing
and
now
i
go
alone
winter
or
springing
the
ballad
of
sir
bors
would
i
could
win
some
quiet
and
rest
and
a
little
ease
in
the
cool
grey
hush
of
the
dusk
in
the
dim
green
place
of
the
trees
where
the
birds
are
singing
singing
singing
crying
aloud
the
song
of
the
red
red
rose
that
blossoms
beyond
the
seas
would
i
could
see
it
the
rose
when
the
light
begins
to
fail
and
a
lone
white
star
in
the
west
is
glimmering
on
the
mail
the
red
red
passionate
rose
of
the
sacred
blood
of
the
christ
in
the
shining
chalice
of
god
the
cup
of
the
holy
grail
the
dusk
comes
gathering
grey
and
the
darkness
dims
the
west
the
oxen
low
to
the
byre
and
all
bells
ring
to
rest
but
i
ride
over
the
moors
for
the
dusk
still
bides
and
waits
that
brims
my
soul
with
the
glow
of
the
rose
that
ends
the
quest
my
horse
is
spavined
and
ribbed
and
his
bones
come
through
his
hide
my
sword
is
rotten
with
rust
but
i
shake
the
reins
and
ride
for
the
bright
white
birds
of
god
that
nest
in
the
rose
have
called
and
never
a
township
now
is
a
town
where
i
can
bide
it
will
happen
at
last
at
dusk
as
my
horse
limps
down
the
fell
a
star
will
glow
like
a
note
god
strikes
on
a
silver
bell
and
the
bright
white
birds
of
god
will
carry
my
soul
to
christ
and
the
sight
of
the
rose
the
rose
will
pay
for
the
years
of
hell
spanish
waters
spanish
waters
spanish
waters
you
are
ringing
in
my
ears
like
a
slow
sweet
piece
of
music
from
the
grey
forgotten
years
telling
tales
and
beating
tunes
and
bringing
weary
thoughts
to
me
of
the
sandy
beach
at
muertos
where
i
would
that
i
could
be
a
surf
breaks
on
los
muertos
and
it
never
stops
to
roar
and
there
we
came
to
anchor
and
there
we
went
ashore
where
the
blue
lagoon
is
silent
amid
snags
of
rotting
trees
dropping
like
the
clothes
of
corpses
cast
up
by
the
seas
we
anchored
at
los
muertos
when
the
dipping
sun
was
red
we
left
her
to
sea
to
west
of
nigger
head
and
before
the
mist
was
on
the
cay
before
the
day
was
done
we
were
all
ashore
on
muertos
with
the
gold
that
we
had
won
we
bore
it
through
the
marshes
in
a
battered
chests
sinking
in
the
sucking
quagmires
to
the
sunburn
on
our
breasts
heaving
over
gasping
damning
at
the
flies
and
heat
longing
for
a
long
drink
out
of
silver
in
the
cool
lazareet
the
moon
came
white
and
ghostly
as
we
laid
the
treasure
down
there
was
gear
make
a
beggarman
as
rich
as
lima
town
copper
charms
and
silver
trinkets
from
the
chests
of
spanish
crews
gold
doubloons
and
double
moydores
louis
and
portagues
clumsy
earrings
from
the
indians
of
brazil
uncut
emeralds
out
of
rio
bezoar
stones
from
guayaquil
silver
in
the
crude
and
fashioned
pots
of
old
arica
bronze
jewels
from
the
bones
of
incas
desecrated
by
the
dons
we
smoothed
the
place
with
mattocks
and
we
took
and
blazed
the
tree
which
marks
yon
where
the
gear
is
hid
that
none
will
ever
see
and
we
laid
aboard
the
ship
again
and
south
away
we
steers
through
the
loud
surf
of
los
muertos
which
is
beating
in
my
ears
the
last
alive
that
knows
it
all
the
rest
have
gone
their
ways
killed
or
died
or
come
to
anchor
in
the
old
mulatas
cays
and
i
go
singing
fiddling
old
and
starved
and
in
despair
and
i
know
where
all
that
gold
is
hid
if
i
were
only
there
not
the
way
to
end
it
all
old
and
nearly
blind
and
an
old
a
strange
thing
for
it
never
leaves
his
mind
and
i
see
in
dreams
awhiles
the
beach
the
disc
dipping
red
and
the
tall
ship
under
topsails
swaying
in
past
nigger
head
be
glad
to
step
ashore
there
glad
to
take
a
pick
and
go
to
the
lone
blazed
tree
in
the
place
no
others
know
and
lift
the
gold
and
silver
that
has
mouldered
there
for
years
by
the
loud
surf
of
los
muertos
which
is
beating
in
my
ears
cargoes

to
the
old

oh
some
good

they
hold
that
a
sin
to
troll
the
jolly

beauty
i
have
seen
dawn
and
sunset
on
moors
and
windy
hills
coming
in
solemn
beauty
like
slow
old
tunes
of
spain
i
have
seen
the
lady

bringing
the
daffodils
bringing
the
springing
grass
and
the
soft
warm
april
rain
i
have
heard
the
song
of
the
blossoms
and
the
old
chant
of
the
sea
and
seen
strange
lands
from
under
the
arched
white
sails
of
ships
but
the
loveliest
things
of
beauty
god
ever
has
showed
to
me
are
her
voice
and
her
hair
and
eyes
and
the
dear
red
curve
of
her
lips
the
seekers
friends
and
loves
we
have
none
nor
wealth
nor
blessed
abode
but
the
hope
of
the
city
of
god
at
the
other
end
of
the

not
for
us
are
content
and
quiet
and
peace
of

for
we
go
seeking
a
city
that
we
shall
never
find
there
is
no
solace
on
earth
for
us
for
such
as
we
who
search
for
a
hidden
city
that
we
shall
never
see
only
the
road
and
the
dawn
the
sun
the
wind
and
the
rain
and
the
watch
fire
under
stars
and
sleep
and
the
road
again
we
seek
the
city
of
god
and
the
haunt
where
beauty
dwells
and
we
find
the
noisy
mart
and
the
sound
of
burial
bells
never
the
golden
city
where
radiant
people
meet
but
the
dolorous
town
where
mourners
are
going
about
the
street
we
travel
the
dusty
road
till
the
light
of
the
day
is
dim
and

shows
us
spires
away
on

we
travel
from

till

and
by
seeking
the
holy
city
beyond
the
rim
of
the

friends

we
have

of
grey
miles
left
behind
in
quest
of
that
one
beauty
god
put
me
here
to
find
midsummer
night
the
perfect
disc
of
the
sacred
moon
through
still
blue
heaven
serenely
swims
and
the
lone
liquid
music
brims
the
peace
of
the
night
with
a
perfect
tune
this
is
that
holiest
night
of
the
year
when
the
mowers
say
may
be
heard
and
seen
the
ghostly
court
of
the
english
queen
who
rides
to
harry
and
hunt
the
deer
and
the
woodland
creatures
cower
awake
a
strange
unrest
is
on
harts
and
does
for
the
maiden
dian
goes
and
the
trembling
deer
are
afoot
in
the
brake
they
start
at
a
shaken
leaf
the
sound
of
a
dry
twig
snapped
by
a
foot
is
a
nameless
dread
and
to
them
the
hoot
of
a
mousing
owl
is
the
cry
of
a
hound
oh
soon
the
forest
will
ring
with
cries
the
dim
green
coverts
will
flash
the
grass
will
glow
as
the
radiant
hunters
pass
after
the
quarry
with
burning
eyes
the
hurrying
feet
will
range
unstayed
of
questing
goddess
and
hunted
fawn
till
the
east
is
grey
with
the
sacred
dawn
and
the
red
cock
wakens
the
milking
maid
the
song
this
sweetness
trembling
from
the
strings
the
music
of
my
troublous
lute
hath
timed
foot
setting
her
whenas
she
danced
to
feasted
kings
where
gemmed
apparel
burned
and
caught
the
sunset
the
golden
dome
to
the
dark
beauties
of
old
rome
my
sorrowful
lute
hath
haply
brought
sad
memories
sweet
with
tender
thought
when
night
had
fallen
and
lights
and
fires
were
darkened
in
the
homes
of
men
some
sighing
echo
stirred
and
then
the
old
cunning
wakened
from
the
wires
the
old
sorrows
and
the
old
desires
dead
kings
in
long
forgotten
lands
and
all
dead
beauteous
women
some
whose
pride
imperial
hath
become
old
armour
rusting
in
the
sands
and
shards
of
iron
in
dusty
hands
have
heard
my
soft
rise
and
fall
go
trembling
down
the
paven
ways
till
every
heart
was
all
ablaze
hasty
each
foot
to
obey
the
call
to
triumph
or
to
funeral
could
i
begin
again
the
slow
sweet
mournful
music
filled
with
tears
surely
the
old
dead
dusty
ears
would
hear
the
old
drowsy
eyes
would
glow
old
memories
come
old
hopes
and
fears
and
time
restore
the
long
ago
the
gentle
lady
so
beautiful
so
so
like
a
delightful
touch
a
beauty
perfect
ripe
complete
that
own
hand
could
only
smutch
and
self
not
better
much
so
beautiful
so
purely
wrought
like
a
fair
missal
penned
with
hymns
so
gentle
so
surpassing
thought
a
beauteous
soul
in
lovely
limbs
a
lantern
that
an
angel
trims
so
without
a
sin
like
gentle
music
gently
timed
like
coming
aptly
in
to
round
a
moonéd
poem
rhymed
to
tunes
the
laughing
bells
have
chimed
the
dead
knight
the
cleanly
rush
of
the
mountain
air
and
the
mumbling
grumbling
are
the
only
things
that
wander
there
the
pitiful
bones
are
laid
at
ease
the
grass
has
grown
in
his
tangled
hair
and
a
rambling
bramble
binds
his
knees
to
shrieve
his
soul
from
the
pangs
of
hell
the
only
requiem
bells
that
rang
were
the
harebell
and
the
heather
bell
hushed
he
is
with
the
holy
spell
in
the
gentle
hymn
the
wind
sang
and
he
lies
quiet
and
sleeps
well
he
is
bleached
and
blanched
with
the
summer
sun
the
misty
rain
and
the
cold
dew
have
altered
him
from
the
kingly
one
whom
his
lady
loved
and
his
men
knew
and
dwindled
him
to
a
skeleton
the
vetches
have
twined
about
his
bones
the
straggling
ivy
twists
and
creeps
in
his
the
nettle
keeps
vigil
about
him
while
he
sleeps
over
his
body
the
wind
moans
with
a
dreary
tune
throughout
the
day
in
a
chorus
wistful
eerie
thin
as
the
cry
as
the
cry
in
the
bay
the
mournful
word
the
seas
say
when
tides
are
wandering
out
or
in
sorrow
of
mydath
weary
the
cry
of
the
wind
is
weary
the
sea
weary
the
heart
and
the
mind
and
the
body
of
me
would
i
were
out
of
it
done
with
it
would
i
could
be
a
white
gull
crying
along
the
desolate
sands
outcast
derelict
soul
in
a
body
accurst
standing
drenched
with
the
spindrift
standing
athirst
for
the
cool
green
waves
of
death
to
arise
and
burst
in
a
tide
of
quiet
for
me
on
the
desolate
sands
would
that
the
waves
and
the
long
white
hair
of
the
spray
would
gather
in
splendid
terror
and
blot
me
away
to
the
sunless
place
of
the
wrecks
where
the
waters
sway
gently
dreamily
quietly
over
desolate
sands
twilight
twilight
it
is
and
the
far
woods
are
dim
and
the
rooks
cry
and
call
down
in
the
valley
the
lamps
and
the
mist
and
a
star
over
all
there
by
the
rick
where
they
thresh
is
the
drone
at
an
end
twilight
it
is
and
i
travel
the
road
with
my
friend
i
think
of
the
friends
who
are
dead
who
were
dear
long
ago
in
the
past
beautiful
friends
who
are
dead
though
i
know
that
death
can
not
last
friends
with
the
beautiful
eyes
that
the
dust
has
defiled
beautiful
souls
who
were
gentle
when
i
was
a
child
invocation
o
wanderer
into
many
brains
o
spark
the
purple
hides
you
sow
the
dusk
with
fiery
grains
when
the
gold
horseman
rides
o
beauty
on
the
darkness
hurled
be
it
through
me
you
shame
the
world
posted
as
missing
under
all
her
topsails
she
trembled
like
a
stag
the
wind
made
a
ripple
in
her
bonny
red
flag
they
cheered
her
from
the
shore
and
they
cheered
her
from
the
pier
and
under
all
her
topsails
she
trembled
like
a
deer
so
she
passed
swaying
where
the
green
seas
run
her
topsails
were
stately
in
the
sun
there
was
glitter
on
the
water
from
her
red
port
light
so
she
passed
swaying
till
she
was
out
of
sight
long
and
long
ago
it
was
a
weary
time
it
is
the
bones
of
her
are
coral
plants
by
this
coral
plants
and
and
a
comb
and
if
the
fishers
net
them
they
never
bring
them
home
rough
on
women
they
have
to
mangle
hard
and
stitch
at
dungarees
till
their
are
scarred
thinking
of
the
who
sang
among
the
crowd
hoisting
of
her
topsails
when
she
sailed
so
proud
a
creed
i
hold
that
when
a
person
dies
his
soul
returns
again
to
earth
arrayed
in
some
new
another
mother
gives
him
birth
with
sturdier
limbs
and
brighter
brain
the
old
soul
takes
the
roads
again
such
is
my
own
belief
and
trust
this
hand
this
hand
that
holds
the
pen
has
many
a
hundred
times
been
dust
and
turned
as
dust
to
dust
again
these
eyes
of
mine
have
blinked
and
shone
in
thebes
in
troy
in
babylon
all
that
i
rightly
think
or
do
or
make
or
spoil
or
bless
or
blast
is
curse
or
blessing
justly
due
for
sloth
or
effort
in
the
past
my
a
statement
of
the
sum
of
vice
indulged
or
overcome
i
know
that
in
my
lives
to
be
my
sorry
heart
will
ache
and
burn
and
worship
unavailingly
the
woman
whom
i
used
to
spurn
and
shake
to
see
another
have
the
love
i
spurned
the
love
she
gave
and
i
shall
know
in
angry
words
in
gibes
and
mocks
and
many
a
tear
a
carrion
flock
of
the
gibes
and
scorns
i
uttered
here
the
brave
word
that
i
failed
to
speak
will
brand
me
dastard
on
the
cheek
and
as
i
wander
on
the
roads
i
shall
be
helped
and
healed
and
blessed
dear
words
shall
cheer
and
be
as
goads
to
urge
to
heights
before
unguessed
my
road
shall
be
the
road
i
made
all
that
i
gave
shall
be
repaid
so
shall
i
fight
so
shall
i
tread
in
this
long
war
beneath
the
stars
so
shall
a
glory
wreathe
my
head
so
shall
i
faint
and
show
the
scars
until
this
case
this
clogging
mould
be
smithied
all
to
kingly
gold
when
bony
death
when
bony
death
has
chilled
her
gentle
blood
and
dimmed
the
brightness
of
her
wistful
eyes
and
changed
her
glorious
beauty
into
mud
by
his
old
skill
in
hateful
wizardries
when
an
old
lichened
marble
strives
to
tell
how
sweet
a
grace
how
red
a
lip
was
hers
when
rheumy
say
i
knew
her
well
showing
the
grave
to
curious
worshippers
when
all
the
roses
that
she
sowed
in
me
have
dripped
their
crimson
petals
and
decayed
leaving
no
greenery
on
any
tree
that
her
dear
hands
in
my
garden
laid
then
grant
old
time
to
my
green
mouldering
skull
these
songs
may
keep
her
memory
beautiful
the
west
wind
a
warm
wind
the
west
wind
full
of
cries
i
never
hear
the
west
wind
but
tears
are
in
my
eyes
for
it
comes
from
the
west
lands
the
old
brown
hills
and
in
the
west
wind
and
daffodils
a
fine
land
the
west
land
for
hearts
as
tired
as
mine
apple
orchards
blossom
there
and
the
like
wine
there
is
cool
green
grass
there
where
men
may
lie
at
rest
and
the
thrushes
are
in
song
there
fluting
from
the
nest
will
you
not
come
home
brother
you
have
been
long
away
april
and
blossom
time
and
white
is
the
spray
and
bright
is
the
sun
brother
and
warm
is
the
rain
will
you
not
come
home
brother
home
to
us
again
the
young
corn
is
green
brother
where
the
rabbits
run
blue
sky
and
white
clouds
and
warm
rain
and
sun
song
to
a
soul
brother
fire
to
a
brain
to
hear
the
wild
bees
and
see
the
merry
spring
again
larks
are
singing
in
the
west
brother
above
the
green
wheat
so
will
you
not
come
home
brother
and
rest
your
tired
feet
a
balm
for
bruised
hearts
brother
sleep
for
aching
eyes
says
the
warm
wind
the
west
wind
full
of
cries
the
white
road
westwards
is
the
road
i
must
tread
to
the
green
grass
the
cool
grass
and
rest
for
heart
and
head
to
the
violets
and
the
brown
brooks
and
the
song
in
the
fine
land
the
west
land
the
land
where
i
belong
her
heart
her
heart
is
always
doing
lovely
things
filling
my
wintry
mind
with
simple
flowers
playing
sweet
tunes
on
my
untuned
strings
delighting
all
my
undelightful
hours
she
plays
me
like
a
lute
what
tune
she
will
no
string
in
me
but
trembles
at
her
touch
shakes
into
sacred
music
or
is
still
trembles
or
stops
or
swells
her
skill
is
such
and
in
the
dusty
tavern
of
my
soul
where
filthy
lusts
drink
brew
for
wine
her
gentle
hand
still
keeps
me
from
the
bowl
still
keeps
me
man
saves
me
from
being
swine
all
grace
in
me
all
sweetness
in
my
verse
is
hers
is
my
dear
and
only
hers
being
her
friend
being
her
friend
i
do
not
care
not
i
how
gods
or
men
may
wrong
me
beat
me
down
her
sufficient
star
to
travel
by
i
count
her
quiet
praise
sufficient
crown
being
her
friend
i
do
not
covet
gold
save
for
a
royal
gift
to
give
her
pleasure
to
sit
with
her
and
have
her
hand
to
hold
is
wealth
i
think
surpassing
minted
treasure
being
her
friend
i
only
covet
art
a
white
pure
flame
to
search
me
as
i
trace
in
crooked
letters
from
a
throbbing
heart
the
hymn
to
beauty
written
on
her
face
fragments
troy
town
is
covered
up
with
weeds
the
rabbits
and
the
pismires
brood
on
broken
gold
and
shards
and
beads
where
ancient
palace
stood
the
floors
of
many
a
gallant
house
are
matted
with
the
roots
of
grass
the
and
the
nimble
mouse
among
her
ruins
flit
and
pass
and
there
in
orts
of
blackened
bone
the
widowed
trojan
beauties
lie
and
simois
babbles
over
stone
and
waps
and
gurgles
to
the
sky
once
there
were
merry
days
in
troy
her
chimneys
smoked
with
cooking
meals
the
passing
chariots
did
annoy
the
sunning
housewives
at
their
wheels
and
many
a
lovely
trojan
maid
set
trojan
lads
to
lovely
things
the
game
of
life
was
nobly
played
they
played
the
game
like
queens
and
kings
so
that
when
troy
had
greatly
passed
in
one
red
roaring
fiery
coal
the
courts
the
grecians
overcast
became
a
city
in
the
soul
in
some
green
island
of
the
sea
where
now
the
shadowy
coral
grows
in
pride
and
pomp
and
empery
the
courts
of
old
atlantis
rose
in
many
a
glittering
house
of
glass
the
atlanteans
wandered
there
the
paleness
of
their
faces
was
like
ivory
so
pale
they
were
and
hushed
they
were
no
noise
of
words
in
those
bright
cities
ever
rang
only
their
thoughts
like
golden
birds
about
their
chambers
thrilled
and
sang
they
knew
all
wisdom
for
they
knew
the
souls
of
those
egyptian
kings
who
learned
in
ancient
babilu
the
beauty
of
immortal
things
they
knew
all
beauty
when
they
thought
the
air
chimed
like
a
stricken
lyre
the
elemental
birds
were
wrought
the
golden
birds
became
a
fire
and
straight
to
busy
camps
and
marts
the
singing
flames
were
swiftly
gone
the
trembling
leaves
of
human
hearts
hid
boughs
for
them
to
perch
upon
and
men
in
desert
places
men
abandoned
broken
sick
with
fears
rose
singing
swung
their
swords
agen
and
laughed
and
died
among
the
spears
the
green
and
greedy
seas
have
drowned
that
glittering
walls
and
towers
her
sunken
minarets
are
crowned
with
red
and
russet
in
towers
and
rooms
and
golden
courts
the
shadowy
coral
lifts
her
sprays
the
scrawl
hath
gorged
her
broken
orts
the
shark
doth
haunt
her
hidden
ways
but
at
the
falling
of
the
tide
the
golden
birds
still
sing
and
gleam
the
atlanteans
have
not
died
immortal
things
still
give
us
dream
the
dream
that
fires
heart
to
make
to
build
to
do
to
sing
or
say
a
beauty
death
can
never
take
an
adam
from
the
crumbled
clay
born
for
nought
else
born
for
nought
else
for
nothing
but
for
this
to
watch
the
soft
blood
throbbing
in
her
throat
to
think
how
comely
sweet
her
body
is
and
learn
the
poem
of
her
face
by
rote
born
for
nought
else
but
to
attempt
a
rhyme
that
shall
describe
her
womanhood
aright
and
make
her
holy
to
the
end
of
time
and
be
my
acquittal
in
sight
born
for
nought
else
but
to
expressly
mark
the
music
of
her
dear
delicious
ways
born
but
to
perish
meanly
in
the
dark
yet
born
to
be
the
man
to
sing
her
praise
born
for
nought
else
there
is
a
spirit
tells
my
a
being
born
for
nothing
else
tewkesbury
road
it
is
good
to
be
out
on
the
road
and
going
one
knows
not
where
going
through
meadow
and
village
one
knows
not
whither
nor
why
through
the
grey
light
drift
of
the
dust
in
the
keen
cool
rush
of
the
air
under
the
flying
white
clouds
and
the
broad
blue
lift
of
the
sky
and
to
halt
at
the
chattering
brook
in
the
tall
green
fern
at
the
brink
where
the
harebell
grows
and
the
gorse
and
the
foxgloves
purple
and
white
where
the
delicate
deer
troop
down
to
the
brook
to
drink
when
the
stars
are
mellow
and
large
at
the
coming
on
of
the
night
o
to
feel
the
beat
of
the
rain
and
the
homely
smell
of
the
earth
is
a
tune
for
the
blood
to
jig
to
a
joy
past
power
of
words
and
the
blessed
green
comely
meadows
are
all
with
mirth
at
the
noise
of
the
lambs
at
play
and
the
dear
wild
cry
of
the
birds
the
death
rooms
my
soul
has
many
an
old
decaying
room
hung
with
the
ragged
arras
of
the
past
where
startled
faces
flicker
in
the
gloom
and
horrid
whispers
set
the
cheek
aghast
those
dropping
rooms
are
haunted
by
a
death
a
something
like
a
worm
gnawing
a
brain
that
bids
me
heed
what
bitter
lesson
saith
the
blind
wind
beating
on
the
none
dwells
in
those
old
rooms
none
ever
can
i
pass
them
through
at
night
with
hidden
head
rotting
rooms
her
eyes
must
never
scan
floors
that
her
blessed
feet
must
never
tread
haunted
old
rooms
rooms
she
must
never
know
where
knock
and
mouldering
panels
glow
ignorance
since
i
have
learned
shining
alphabet
and
spelled
in
ink
writ
in
me
in
flame
and
borne
her
sacred
image
richly
set
here
in
my
heart
to
keep
me
quit
of
shame
since
i
have
learned
how
wise
and
passing
wise
is
the
dear
friend
whose
beauty
i
extol
and
know
how
sweet
a
soul
looks
through
the
eyes
that
are
so
pure
a
window
to
her
soul
since
i
have
learned
how
rare
a
woman
shows
as
much
in
all
she
does
as
in
her
looks
and
seen
the
beauty
of
her
shame
the
rose
and
dim
the
beauty
writ
about
in
books
all
i
have
learned
and
can
learn
shows
me
this
how
scant
how
slight
my
knowledge
of
her
is
sea
fever
i
must
go
down
to
the
seas
again
to
the
lonely
sea
and
the
sky
and
all
i
ask
is
a
tall
ship
and
a
star
to
steer
her
by
and
the
kick
and
the
song
and
the
white
shaking
and
a
grey
mist
on
the
face
and
a
grey
dawn
breaking
i
must
go
down
to
the
seas
again
for
the
call
of
the
running
tide
is
a
wild
call
and
a
clear
call
that
may
not
be
denied
and
all
i
ask
is
a
windy
day
with
the
white
clouds
flying
and
the
flung
spray
and
the
blown
spume
and
the
crying
i
must
go
down
to
the
seas
again
to
the
vagrant
gypsy
life
to
the
way
and
the
way
where
the
like
a
whetted
knife
and
all
i
ask
is
a
merry
yarn
from
a
laughing
and
quiet
sleep
and
a
sweet
dream
when
the
long
over
the
watch
in
the
wood
when
death
has
laid
her
in
his
quietude
and
dimmed
the
glow
of
her
benignant
star
her
tired
limbs
shall
rest
within
a
wood
in
a
green
glade
where
oaks
and
beeches
are
where
the
shy
fawns
the
pretty
fawns
the
deer
with
mild
brown
eyes
shall
view
her
husk
the
sleeping
woman
of
her
will
appear
the
maiden
dian
shining
through
the
dusk
and
when
the
stars
are
white
as
twilight
fails
and
the
green
leaves
are
hushed
and
the
winds
swoon
the
calm
pure
thrilling
throats
of
nightingales
shall
hymn
her
sleeping
beauty
to
the
moon
all
the
woods
hushed
save
for
a
dripping
rose
all
the
woods
dun
save
where
a
glows
brimming
the
quiet
woods
with
holiness
the
lone
brown
birds
will
hymn
her
till
the
dawn
the
delicate
shy
dappled
deer
will
press
soft
pitying
muzzles
on
her
swathed
lawn
the
little
pretty
rabbits
running
by
will
pause
among
the
dewy
grass
to
peep
their
thudding
hearts
affrighted
to
espy
the
maiden
dian
lying
there
asleep
brown
lustrous
placid
eyes
of
sylvan
things
will
wonder
at
the
quiet
in
her
face
while
from
the
thorny
branch
the
singer
brings
beauty
and
peace
to
that
immortal
place
until
the
grey
dawn
sets
the
woods
astir
the
pure
thrilling
psalm
will
mourn
for
her
in
the
dark
womb
where
i
began
my
life
made
me
a
man
through
all
the
months
of
human
birth
her
beauty
fed
my
common
earth
i
can
not
see
nor
breathe
nor
stir
but
through
the
death
of
some
of
her
down
in
the
darkness
of
the
grave
she
can
not
see
the
life
she
gave
for
all
her
love
she
can
not
tell
whether
i
use
it
ill
or
well
nor
knock
at
dusty
doors
to
find
her
beauty
dusty
in
the
mind
if
the
gates
could
be
undone
she
would
not
know
her
little
son
i
am
so
grown
if
we
should
meet
she
would
pass
by
me
in
the
street
unless
my
face
let
her
see
my
sense
of
what
she
did
for
me
what
have
i
done
to
keep
in
mind
my
debt
to
her
and
womankind
what
happier
life
repays
her
for
those
months
of
wretched
days
for
all
my
mouthless
body
leeched
ere
releasing
hell
was
reached
what
have
i
done
or
tried
or
said
in
thanks
to
that
dear
woman
dead
men
triumph
over
women
still
men
trample
rights
at
will
and
lust
roves
the
world
untamed
o
grave
keep
shut
lest
i
be
shamed
waste
no
rose
but
fades
no
glory
but
must
pass
no
hue
but
dims
no
precious
silk
but
frets
her
beauty
must
go
underneath
the
grass
under
the
long
roots
of
the
violets
o
many
glowing
beauties
time
has
hid
in
that
dark
blotting
box
the
villain
sends
he
covers
over
with
a
mothers
and
sons
and
foes
and
lovely
friends
maids
that
were
and
friends
that
deserved
a
sweeter
bed
than
clay
all
are
as
blossoms
blowing
down
the
wind
things
the
old
envious
villain
sweeps
away
and
though
the
mutterer
laughs
and
church
bells
toll
death
brings
another
april
to
the
soul
third
mate
all
the
sheets
are
clacking
all
the
blocks
are
whining
the
sails
are
frozen
stiff
and
the
wetted
decks
are
shining
the
in
the
topsails
and
coming
on
to
blow
and
i
think
of
the
dear
girl
i
left
long
ago
grey
were
her
eyes
and
her
hair
was
long
and
bonny
golden
was
her
hair
like
the
wild
honey
and
i
was
but
a
dog
and
a
mad
one
to
despise
the
gold
of
her
hair
and
the
grey
of
her
eyes
the
sea
before
me
and
my
behind
me
and
beyond
there
the
strange
lands
where
nobody
will
mind
me
no
one
but
the
girls
with
the
paint
upon
their
cheeks
who
sell
away
their
beauty
to
whomsoever
seeks
be
drink
and
women
there
and
songs
and
laughter
peace
from
what
is
past
and
from
all
that
follows
after
and
a
fellow
will
forget
how
a
woman
lies
awake
lonely
in
the
night
watch
crying
for
his
sake
black
it
blows
and
bad
and
it
howls
like
slaughter
and
the
ship
she
shudders
as
she
takes
the
water
hissing
flies
the
spindrift
like
a
smoke
and
i
think
of
a
woman
and
a
heart
i
broke
the
wild
duck
twilight
red
in
the
west
dimness
a
glow
on
the
wood
the
teams
plod
home
to
rest
the
wild
duck
come
to
glean
o
souls
not
understood
what
a
wild
cry
in
the
pool
what
things
have
the
farm
ducks
seen
that
they
cry
so
huddle
and
cry
only
the
soul
that
goes
eager
eager
flying
over
the
globe
of
the
moon
over
the
wood
that
glows
wings
linked
necks
a
rush
and
a
wild
crying
a
cry
of
the
long
pain
in
the
reeds
of
a
steel
lagoon
in
a
land
that
no
man
knows
christmas
o
the
sea
breeze
will
be
steady
and
the
tall
going
trim
and
the
dark
blue
skies
are
paling
and
the
white
stars
burning
dim
the
long
night
watch
is
over
and
the
long
done
and
yonder
light
is
the
start
point
light
and
yonder
comes
the
sun
o
we
have
been
with
the
spaniards
and
far
and
long
on
the
sea
but
there
are
the
twisted
chimneys
and
the
gnarled
old
inns
on
the
quay
the
wind
blows
keen
as
the
day
breaks
the
roofs
are
white
with
the
rime
and
the
ring
as
the
sun
comes
up
to
call
men
in
to
prime
the
rock
and
jangle
and
there
is
peace
on
the
earth
peace
and
good
will
and
plenty
and
christmas
games
and
mirth
o
the
gold
glints
bright
on
the
as
it
shifts
above
the
house
and
the
water
of
the
bar
of
salcombe
is
muttering
about
the
bows
o
the
salt
sea
tide
of
salcombe
it
wrinkles
into
wisps
of
foam
and
the
ring
in
salcombe
to
ring
poor
sailors
home
the
belfry
rocks
as
the
bells
ring
the
chimes
are
merry
as
a
song
they
ring
home
wandering
sailors
who
have
been
homeless
long
the
word
my
friend
my
bonny
friend
when
we
are
old
and
hand
in
hand
go
tottering
down
the
hill
may
we
be
rich
in
refinèd
gold
may
gold
coin
be
current
with
us
still
may
love
be
sweeter
for
the
vanished
days
and
your
most
perfect
beauty
still
as
dear
as
when
your
troubled
singer
stood
at
gaze
in
the
dear
march
of
a

the
very
material
that
has
refused
to
yield
it
for
almost
a
score

only
yielded
it
with

masefield

the
spirit

patience

her
shortcomings
of

daring
to
chant
his

times

social
circumstances
who
ought
to
become
known
to

he
is
bringing
a
message
