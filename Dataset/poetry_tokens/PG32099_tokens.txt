poem
revised
i
on
the
cold
and
dark
atlantic
the
night
was
growing
late
steamed
the
maiden
ship
titanic
crowded
with
human
freight
she
was
valued
at
ten
million
the
grandest
ever
roamed
the
seas
fitted
complete
to
swim
the
ocean
when
the
rolling
billows
freeze
ii
she
bade
farewell
to
england
all
dressed
in
robes
of
white
going
out
to
plow
the
briny
deep
and
was
on
her
western
flight
she
was
now
so
swiftly
gliding
in
l
fifty
and
fourteen
when
the
watchman
viewed
the
monster
just
a
mile
from
it
seen
iii
warned
by
a
german
vessel
of
an
enemy
just
ahead
of
an
iceberg
that
sea
monster
that
which
the
seamen
dread
on
steamed
this
great
titanic
she
was
in
her
swiftest
flight
she
was
trying
to
break
the
record
on
that
fearful
fearful
night
iv
oh
she
was
plowing
the
ocean
for
speed
not
known
before
but
alas
she
struck
asunder
to
last
for
ever
more
a
wireless
message
began
to
spread
throughout
the
mighty
deep
it
said
have
struck
an
iceberg
being
delayed
please
rush
to
us
with
the
captain
of
the
white
star
line
who
stood
there
in
command
was
an
admiral
of
seasoned
mind
enroute
to
the
western
land
the
captain
thought
not
of
his
life
but
stood
there
to
the
last
and
swimming
saved
a
little
child
as
it
came
floating
past
vi
outstretched
hands
offered
reward
for
his
brave
and
heroic
deed
but
the
intrepid
man
went
down
aboard
trying
to
rescue
a
passenger
instead
this
giant
of
the
sea
was
carried
to
his
grave
on
the
last
and
greatest
ship
was
he
that
ever
cleft
a
wave
vii
gay
was
the
crew
aboard
this
ship
passengers
large
and
small
they
viewed
the
coming
danger
they
felt
it
one
and
all
on
played
the
grand
orchestra
their
notes
were
soft
and
clear
they
realized
power
on
land
on
sea
just
as
near
viii
so
they
played
this
glorious
anthem
continued
on
the
sea
and
repeated
the
beautiful
chorus
my
god
to
then
silenced
when
the
ship
went
down
their
notes
were
heard
no
more
surely
wear
a
starry
crown
on
that
celestial
shore
ix

to
his

you
dear
tomorrow
in

his
bride
asked
a
seaman

may
husband
go
the
echo
came
upon
the
blue
he
answered
may
you
x
this
man
rushed
not
to
his
seat
he
seem
to
have
no
fear
being
calm
serene
and
discreet
tendered
it
to
a
lady
near
go

said
my
darling
wife

of
good
cheer
as
sure
as

you
over
xi
well
could
he
have
known
this
dreadful
night
the
sea
would
be
his
grave
though
he
worked
with
all
his
might
for
those
whom
he
could
save
this
man
a
soldier
once
has
been
of
military
art
proved
himself
full
competent

to
do
his
noble
part
xii
major
butt
well
known
to
fame
a
lady
did
entreat
to
kindly
name
him
to
his
friends
whom
she
perchance
to
meet
he
forced
the
men
to
realize
the
weaker
they
should
save
he
gave
his
life
with
no
surprise
to
the
watery
grave
and
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
he
turned
to
meet
his
fate
soon
soon
the
sea
would
be
his
grave
in
and
ever
after
date
xiii
and
strauss
who
did
the
children
feed
had
mercy
on
the
poor
and
all
such
men
the
world
doth
need
to
reverence
evermore
oh
may
the
union
of
strauss
and
wife
be
memorial
to
all
men

for
the
other

their
life
a
life
we
should
commend
and

all
girls
who
chance
in
life

the
deed
of
such
a
wife
as
went
down
in
the
blue

the
great
titanic
with
faster
and
faster
speed
until
alas
there
comes
a
burst
she
bade
farewell
indeed
farewell
farewell
to
land
and
seas
farewell
to
wharves
and
shore
for
i
must
land
beneath
the
breeze
to
reach
the
land
no
more
i
carry
with
me
more
human
weight
than
ever
recorded
before
to
leave
them
on
a
land
sedate
they
will
land
oh
land

more
