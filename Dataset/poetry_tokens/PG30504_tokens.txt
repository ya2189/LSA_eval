dinner
at
eight
at
times
i
thought
of
swizzling
white
rum
in
the
tropics
not
as
a
vocation
dropping
into
the
club
for
a
round
of
tennis
before
dinner
at
eight
or
a
quiet
set
of
darts
before
retiring
i
had
grown
accustomed
to
my
new
routine
at
least
vicariously
in
the
best
somerset
maugham
tradition
i
would
dress
for
dinner
decline
to
be
patronizing
avoid
the
potential
slur
if
crisp
linen
did
not
appear
regularly
on
my
bed
or
table
i
still
found
time
to
stop
for
breakfast
coffee
take
a
moment
from
regimen
to
fondle
fresh
wet
flowers
look
over
the
balcony
at
the
blueness
of
the
bay
the
metaphysical
qualities
that
come
into
play
erode
such
morning
somnambulations
the
heat
depreciated
any
vainglorious
attempts
to
lionize
the
native
caribbean
rum
tennis
and
darts
become
more
of
a
task
than
a
pleasant
diversion
the
little
yellowed
board
seemed
to
symbolize
not
convivial
cordiality
but
crabbed
provincialism
the
tie
collar
were
intolerable
against
the
saline
tropic
night
and
seemed
rigid
in
a
place
and
time
the
locals
could
not
possibly
share
in
short
such
things
celebrated
my
apartness
linen
rarely
if
ever
appeared
and
to
resort
to
complaints
resulted
in
only
furthering
the
distance
between
one
and
his
hosts
even
the
coffee
tasted
bitter
and
seemed
unsuited
to
the
needs
of
an
interloper
neither
was
fruit
juice
the
promised
manna
and
one
can
take
only
so
much
nostalgic
flower
warbling
the
hummingbirds
and
oleander
came
to
grow
as
commonplace
and
exhausting
as
the
rain
i
began
ruminating
thoughts
back
to
my
previous
existence
surprised
at
my
illogical
shift
in
allegiances
i
began
stealing
thoughts
more
and
more
surreptitiously
about
the
naturalness
of
working
a
full
day
donning
the
apparel
of
a
civilized
man
dropping
the
white

burden
disgust
filled

hues
drip
upon
wetness
forlorn
with
tug
and
rein
rites
of
intensification
did
time
on
the
hegelian
spirit
freudian
id
the
totemic
response
to
the
unknowable
where
each
phenomenon
of
nature
became
dream
time
itself
the
electric
crackle
of
god
movement
from
shadowy
spectre
to
showmanship
the
learned
empathy
of
tires
careening
around
their
throttled
load
jagged
wire
a
rail
fence
is
more
than
that
on
a
country
dawn
moving
by
lots
over
hill
stone
it
barely
pauses
in
the
small
of
the
field
lap
then
is
caught
in
grey
positioning
as
light
unfurls
the
sky
all
is
a
matter
of
perfect
blistering
dauber
wasps
are
seen
to
heave
the
moistened
wood
in
chunks
to
mossy
furrows
benign
in
their
firm
embrace
upon
alabaster
trees
there
crusts
of
heavy
nails
marked
like
fortresses
droop
in
their
rusty
mail
mostly
ants
in
open
canter
move
in
as
upon
an
urn
lance
far
more
than
jagged
wire
the
breath
of
stillest
air
eyeshine
i
remember
the
world
like
a
picture
the
habitat
of
trees
and
sense
impressions
the
cover
of
leaves
as
fall
spurred
its
way
thru
corridors
of
plasma
forest
sarsen
stone
most
of
all
i
saw
illuminated
clearly
the
brash
self
poke
of
logic
that
came
massively
when
sunlight
stirred
lilted
its
early
head
erasing
the
world
thru
sand
crusts
of
colour
the
cabin
floor
a
cold
dawn
infinity
was
a
chilblain
on
frosty
morning
shadows
the
old
cupboards
staring
like
flowers
through
a
break
in
the
leaves
watched
till
the
latches
hinges
were
worlds
in
frozen
power
dark
rust
as
thoughts
meandering
like
age
the
stamped
down
clay
the
well
worn
earthen
crust
that
met
the
door
on
opening
showed
the
erring
calender
all
its
interminable
days
that
waited
like
madmen
to
remind
one
of
oceanic
time
and
on
wakening
the
careless
passage
of
life
across
speckled
windows
saw
a
terrain
of
light
tiny
works
in
agility
the
forest
looming
bright
as
meridians
off
ladders
bristling
with
homuncular
forms
door
of
caring
the
gentle
trail
left
as
a
universe
to
announce
the
brittle
thrust
and
restive
eves
of
daytime
shadow
sweet
water
the
leaves
lie
hidden
as
spades
about
their
home
brief
movement
of
a
kitten
then
silence
till
the
car
engine
drones
close
by
a
pioneer
cemetery
sits
near
a
secondary
wood
queer
is
the
effect
of
sun
on
a
tinted
roof
bluebells
with
poppies
cowslip
and
tiny
brook
back
of
fields
redden
and
given
to
wheat
a
house
is
a
machine
processing
the
water
of
living
a
replenished
cistern
birds
paying
a
call
a
minor
animal
brushing
past

primavera
a
poem
is
perishable
and
like
it
so
much
of
life
is
spent
in
intervals
the
jarring
second
regaining
consciousness
a
flick
of
the
lank
equestrian
eyelid
that
signals
morning
first
crepuscular
move
a
little
salad
consciousness
about
the
tumescent
room
with
the
sentient
purr
of
a
cat
her
musky
oils
a
green
verdure
lapping
primordial
scent
to
engross
a
little
readiness
as
the
day
progresses
to
its
oedipal
stage
and
arrested
development
the
encounter
today
surprised
me
like
a
red
fox
blurting
out
of
an
october
thicket
empty
dry
the
burst
of
its
energy
camouflaged
much
as
that
fox
solemn
and
cold
biding
his
time
till
he
thought
i
passed
magpie

trillium
breath
an
ounce
of
feathered
growth
unravels
in
the
cloves
of
the
silent
forest
the
rain
is
heavy
with
the
stamp
of
perfumed
trees
realizing
slight
restraint
on
bursting
seed
cloaked
in
fragrance
tufts
of
mossy
step
kiss
the
opening
earth
a
basement
horizon
presumes
the
darling
test
of
flower
across
dale
rustling
nook
then
undresses
moist
greenery
with
sumptuous
eye
the
last
is
hardest
cat
crimson
a
fire
weed
sunset

the
rain
erased
away
nobody
special
harangues
the
leaves
but
birds
steal
in
quietly
with
tenderness
clothed
of
verdure
to
pinch
a
leafy
oasis
about
their
forest
haunt

plums
and
vine
as
the

is
green
intone
the
heavy

with
errant

so

they
are
big
with
earthly
passion
racing
for
the

so

that
each

all
stooped
under
such
worldly
avarice
perhaps
perhaps
the

once
was
shadows
the

lisped

now
those
warm

ease
departing
sorrow
like
pressed

emptied
from

approaching

the

tenebrous

accosted
by
callow

bleeds
the

with

no

shibboleths
to
restrain
the
wriggling

in
the

or
nestling

gerundive

each

whimper
of

a

poised
about
the

as
far
as
you

nothing
unusual
a
total
of
eight
hundred

no

slow

breech
this

with

stronger
than
the

in
their

the

upon

the

and
then
there
are
the
bludgeoned
stars
fallen
into
the
eyes
of
my
farmhouse
scene
the
sphinx
moth
that
darns
the
night
with
her
acrobatics
escapes
the

of

that
places
about

proboscised

the

a
definite

projects
the
starling

forlorn
now
with
limpid
darkness
crushed

from
the
pews
of

night
there
are
armfuls
of
crushed

in
the

to
my
heart

reeking
with
squeals
to
alarm
the
most
frightened

only

stained

and
i
must
find
her
a
toad
abides
the
thoughtful
recess
broken
under

he
is
a
good
toad
and
mourns
the
night
creaking
from
the
river

a

dragon
to
the

making
a

a

only
in

buried
deep
near

of
the

the

of

all
those

breaking
under
the

of

leaves
me
like

i

no

my

i

age
with
each
petal
fall
of
a
stockinged
foot
red
illusions
under
glass
life
as
green
illusion
the
cool
fronds
of
the
fern
are
deep
set
in
firmest
soil
and
the
grassy
narrows
brook
a
silent
liquid
play
red
illusions
under
glass
quietly
picking
strawberries
where
a
woman
hums
to
the
buzz
of
flies
with
the
afternoon
sun
disappearing
overhead
each
grasp
of
the
berry
a
red
stain
the
darting
of
seeds
crimson
tendrils
do
confuse
the
eye
with
a
polka
dot
starling
raucous
in
glee
above
