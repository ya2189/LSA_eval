satan
absolved

john

the
bodley
head
dedicated
by
permission
to
herbert
spencer
preface
in
publishing
this
poem
the
author
feels
that
some
apology
is
needed
it
deals
with
matters
of
a
kind
not
usually
treated
in
modern
verse
and
which
ask
to
be
approached
if
at
all
with
dignity
and
reverence
he
trusts
that
he
will
not
be
found
lacking
on
this
essential
point
nevertheless
he
can
not
expect
but
that
he
may
wound
by
his
plain
speaking
the
feelings
of
those
among
his
readers
who
sincerely
believe
that
nineteenth
century
civilisation
is
synonymous
with
christianity
and
that
the
english
race
above
all
those
in
existence
has
a
special
mission
from
heaven
to
subdue
and
occupy
the
earth
the
of
the
author
countrymen
on
this
head
is
too
deeply
seated
to
be
attacked
without
offence
he
has
not
however
shrunk
from
so
attacking
and
from
insisting
on
the
truth
that
the
hypocrisy
and
greed
of
modern
england
is
an
atrocious
spectacle
one
which
if
there
be
any
justice
in
heaven
must
bring
a
curse
from
god
as
it
has
surely
already
made
the
angels
weep
the
destruction
of
beauty
in
the
name
of
science
the
destruction
of
happiness
in
the
name
of
progress
the
destruction
of
reverence
in
the
name
of
religion
these
are
the
pharisaic
crimes
of
all
the
white
races
but
there
is
something
in
the
impiety
crueller
still
that
it
also
destroys
as
no
other
race
does
for
its
mere
pleasure
the
alone
has
in
our
day
exterminated
root
and
branch
whole
tribes
of
mankind
he
alone
has
depopulated
continents
species
after
species
of
their
wonderful
animal
life
and
is
still
yearly
destroying
and
this
not
merely
to
occupy
the
land
for
it
lies
in
large
part
empty
but
for
his
insatiable
lust
of
violent
adventure
to
make
record
bags
and
kill
that
things
are
so
is
ample
reason
for
the
hardest
words
the
author
can
command
to
his
fellow
poets
and
poetic
critics
the
author
too
would
say
a
word
he
has
chosen
as
the
vehicle
of
his
thought
a
metre
to
which
in
english
they
are
unaccustomed
the
alexandrine
couplet
for
some
reason
which
the
author
has
never
understood
this
the
classic
metre
in
france
has
stood
in
disrepute
with
us
yet
he
ventures
to
think
that
for
rhetorical
and
dramatic
purposes
it
is
infinitely
preferable
to
our
own
heroic
couplet
and
preferable
even
in
any
hands
but
the
strongest
to
our
traditional
blank
verse
he
believes
moreover
that
if
our
skilled
dramatists
would
make
trial
of
it
it
would
by
its
extreme
flexibility
and
the
natural
break
of
its
cesura
enable
them
to
capture
that
shyest
of
all
shy
things
success
in
a
rhymed
modern
play
at
least
he
trusts
that
they
will
give
it
their
consideration
and
not
condemn
him
because
having
a
rhetorical
subject
to
deal
with
he
has
treated
it
rhetorically
and
in
what
he
considers
the
best
rhetoric
form
though
both
rhetoric
and
alexandrines
are
out
of
fashion
lastly
he
has
to
discharge
in
connection
with
his
poem
a
double
debt
of
gratitude
the
poem
unworthy
as
it
is
is
by
permission
dedicated
to
the
first
of
living
thinkers
herbert
spencer
to
his
reasoned
and
advocacy
of
the
rights
of
the
weak
in
man
higher
evolution
is
due
all
that
in
the
poem
is
intellectually
worthiest
to
this
and
to
the
inspiration
of
much
personal
encouragement
and
sympathy
received
by
the
author
at
a
moment
of
public
excitement
when
it
was
onerous
yet
necessary
for
the
author
to
speak
unpopular
truths
to
spencer
great
name
the
author
would
add
the
name
of
that
other
senior
of
the
ideal
world
george
frederick
watts
the
first
of
living
painters
with
whom
while
the
poem
was
in
progress
it
was
his
privilege
to
spend
many
emotional
hours
in
high
communings
on
life
and
death
and
the
tragic
beauty
of
the
world
he
would
thank
him
publicly
here
for
the
leave
generously
given
him
to
add
to
the
volume
its
chief
ornament
the
frontispiece
which
is
a
reproduction
of
watts
angel
of
pity
weeping
over
the
dead
birds
wings
to
both
these
heroic
workers
in
the
cause
of
good

gratitude

the
mortal
curse
of
always
he
will
mayhap
agree
i
was
less
wholly
wrong
about
humanity
the
day
i
dared
to
warn
his
wisdom
of
that
flaw
it
was
at

the
truth
the
whole
truth
i
foresaw
when
he
must
needs
create
that
simian
in

no

oh
i

who
are
these
that
come
with
their

last
shed
were
my

that
night
of
reprobation
when
i
unsheathed
my
sword
and
headed
the
lost
nation
since
then
not
one
of
them
has
spoken
above
his
breath
or
whispered
in
these
courts
one
word
of
life
or
death
displeasing
to
the

no
seraph
of

all
save
i
this
day
each

has
dared
to
cross
heaven

and
give
voice
to
ill
news
an
unwelcome
truth
to
him
not
michael

hath
dared

we
would
know

plan
his
true

for
the

the
wherefore
and
the
why
of
his
long
patience
mocked
his

we
have
no
heart
to

new
satan
ye
have
made
a
late
discovery
angels
there
is
no
rain
no
dew
no
watering
of
god
grace
that
can
make
green
man
heart
or
draw
him
nearer
heaven
to
play
a
godlier
part
our
service
has
grown
vain
we
have
no
rest
nor
sleep
the
earth
cry
is
too
loud
satan
ye
have
all
cause
to
weep
since
you
depend
on
man
i
told
it
and
foretold
angels
truly
thou
didst
satan
dear
fools
but
have
ye
heart
to
hold
such
plaint
before
the
lord
to
apprise
him
of
this
thing
in
its
full
naked
fact
and
call
your
reckoning
angels
we
dare
not
face
his
frown
he
lives
in
ignorance
his
pride
is
in
his
earth
if
he
but
looks
askance
we
tremble
and
grow
dumb
satan
and
ye
will
bear
it
then
angels
we
dare
not
grieve
his
peace
he
loves
this
race
of
men
satan
the
truth
should
hardly
grieve
angels
he
would
count
it
us
for
pride
he
holds
mankind
redeemed
since
his
son
stooped
and
died
we
dare
not
venture
satan
see
i
have
less
than
you
to
lose
give
me
your
brief
angels
ay
speak
thee
he
will
not
refuse
mayhap
thou
shalt
persuade
him
satan
and
withal
find
grace

a
just
god

will
rejudge
this
case

churnedst
them
to

stars

thou
chainedst
them
with

they

sin
those
stars
change

rebel
nay
they
were

solitude

i
who
thine
outcast
am
the
banished
thief
of

thy
too
long
reprobate
thou
didst
create
to
thee
a
world
of
happy
spirits
for
thy
company
for
thy
delight
and
solace
as
being
too
weary
grown
of
thy
sole
loneliness
was
ill
to
be
alone
and
thou
didst
make
us
pure
as
thou
thyself
art
pure
yet
was
there
seed
of
ill
what
spirit
may
endure
the
friction
of
the
spirit
where

are

is
thou
gavest
us
mind

will
all
snares
to
happiness
the
lord

unhappy
blinded
one
how
sinnedst
thou
reveal
satan
lord
through
my
too
great
love
through
my
excess
of
zeal
listen
thy
third
creation
the
lord
god
ha
the
earth
speak
plain
now
will
i
half
forgive
thee
what
of
the
earth
of
men
was
that
not
then
the
best
the
noblest
of
the
three
satan
ah
glorious
lord
god
thou
hadst
infinity
from
which
to
choose
thy
plan
this
plan
no
less
than
those
was
noble
in
conception
when
its
vision
rose
before
thee
in
thy
dreams
thou
deemedst
to
endow
time
with
a
great
new
wonder
wonderful
as
thou
matter
made
sensitive
informed
with
life
with
soul
it
grieved
thee
the
stars
knew
not
thou
couldst
not
cajole
their
music
into
tears
their
beauty
to
full
praise
thou
askedst
one
made
conscious
of
thy
works
and
ways
one
dowered
with
sense
and
passion
which
should
feel
and
move
and
weep
with
thee
and
laugh
one
that
alas
should
love
thus
didst
thou
mould
the
earth
we
spirits
wondering
eyed
thy
fleshly
things
thy
matter
deified
we
saw
the
sea
take
life
its
myriad
forms
all
fair
we
saw
the
creeping
things
the
dragons
of
the
air
the
birds
the
beasts
all
beautiful
all
strong
all
brimming
with
joyaunce
new
green
woods
among
twice
glorious
in
their
lives
and
we
who
were
but
spirit
envied
their
lusty
lot
their
duplicated
merit
their
feet
their
eyes
their
wings
their
physical
desires
the
anger
of
their
voices
the
fierce
sexual
fires
which
lit
their
sentient
limbs
and
joined
them
heart
to
heart
their
power
to
act
to
feel
all
that
corporeal
part
which
is
the
truth
of
love
and
giveth
the
breathing
thing
the
wonder
of
its
beauty
incarnate
in
spring
what
was
there
lord
in
heaven
comparable
with
this
the
mother
beast
with
her
young
not
even
thy
happiness
lord
of
the
universe
what
beautiful
what
bold
what
passionate
as
she
she
doth
not
chide
nor
scold
when
at
her
dugs
he
mumbleth
nay
the
milk
she
giveth
is
as
a
sacrament
the
power
by
which
he
liveth
a
double
life
with
hers
and
they
two
in
a
day
know
more
of
perfect
joy
than
we
poor
spirits
may
in
our
eternity
of
sober
loneliness
this
was
the
thing
we
saw
and
praised
thee
and
did
bless
the
lord
god
where
then
did
the
fault
lie
thou
witnessest
again
was
it
because
of
death
life
complement
or
pain
that
thou
didst
loose
thy
pride
to
question
of
my
will
satan
nay
lord
thou
knowest
the
truth
these
evils
are
not
ill
they
do
but
prove
thy
wisdom
all
that
lives
must
perish
else
were
the
life
at
charge
the
bodily
fires
they
cherish
accumulating
ills
the
creatures
thou
didst
make
sink
when
their
day
is
done
they
slough
time
like
the
snake
how
many
hundred
sunsets
yet
night
comes
for
rest
and
they
awake
no
more
and
sleep
and
it
is
best
what
lord
would
i
not
give
to
shift
my
cares
and
lie
enfolded
in
time
arms
eternally
no
was
not
death
nor
pain
pain
the
true
salt
of
pleasure
the
condiment
that
stings
and
teaches
each
his
measure
the
limit
of
his
strength
joy
value
in
his
hand
it
was
not
these
we
feared
we
bowed
to
thy
command
even
to
that
stern
decree
which
bade
the
lion
spring
upon
the
weakling
steer
the
falcon
bend
her
wing
to
reive
the
laggard
fowl
the
monster
of
the
deep
devour
and
be
devoured
he
who
hath
sown
shall
reap
and
we
beheld
the
earth
by
that
mute
law
controlled
grow
ever
young
and
new
time
necklace
of
pure
gold
set
on
creation
neck
we
gazed
and
we
applauded
the
splendour
of
thy
might
thy
incarnated
godhead
and
yet
lord
god
forgive
nay
hear
me
thou
wert
not
content
with
this
fair
world
in
its
first
glorious
thought
thou
needs
must
make
thee
man
ah
there
thy
wisdom
strayed
thou
wantedst
one
to
know
thee
no
mere
servile
jade
but
a
brave
upright
form
to
walk
the
earth
and
be
thy
lieutenant
with
all
and
teach
integrity
one
to
aspire
adorn
to
stand
the
roof
and
crown
of
thy
creation
house
in
full
dominion
the
fairest
noblest
best
of
thy
created
things
one
thou
shouldst
call
thy
rose
of
all
time
blossomings
and
thou
evolvedst
man
there
were
a
thousand
forms
all
glorious
all
sublime
the
riders
of
thy
storms
the
battlers
of
thy
seas
the
lords
of
earth
from
which
to
choose
thy
stem
and
get
thee
a
new
birth
there
were
forms
painted
proud
bright
birds
with
plumes
of
heaven
and
songs
more
sweet
than
angels
heard
on
the
hills
at
even
frail
flashing
butterflies
free
fishes
of
such
hue
as
rainbows
hardly
have
sleek
serpents
which
renew
their
glittering
coats
like
gems
grave
kine
elephants
the
horse
how
near
divine
the
whale
the
mastodon
the
mighty
behemoth
leviathan
self
awake
and
glorious
in
his
wrath
all
these
thou
hadst
for
choice
competitors
with
thee
for
thy
new
gift
and
prize
thy
yet
didst
thou
choose
lord
god
the
one
comedian
shape
in
thy
creation
range
the
lewd
ape
and
calledst
him
in
scorn
of
all
that
brave
parade
king
of
thy
living
things
in
thine
own
likeness
made
where
lord
was
then
thy
wisdom
we
who
watched
thee
saw
more
than
thyself
didst
see
we
recognised
the
flaw
the
certainty
of
fault
and
i
in
zeal
spake
plain
the
lord
god
thou
didst
rebellious
spirit
and
thy
zeal
was
vain
thou
spakest
in
thy
blindness
was
it
hard
for
god
thinkest
thou
to
choose
his
graft
to
wring
from
the
worst
clod
his
noblest
fruiting
nay
man
baseness
was
the
test
the
text
of
his
its
proof
made
manifest
there
was
nought
hard
for
god
satan
except
to
win
man
heart
lord
hear
me
to
the
end
thy
will
found
counterpart
only
in
man
thy
truth
in
his
thy
beauty
in
his
baseness
ruth
in
his
order
in
his
see
lord
what
hath
been
to
thy
fair
earth
through
him
the
fount
and
origin
of
all
its
temporal
woes
how
was
it
ere
he
came
in
his
high
arrogance
sad
creature
without
shame
thou
dost
remember
lord
the
glorious
world
it
was
the
beauty
the
abundance
the
unbroken
face
of
undulent
forest
spread
without
or
rent
or
seam
from
mountain
foot
to
mountain
one
embroidered
hem
fringing
the
mighty
plains
through
which
thy
rivers
strayed
thy
lakes
thy
floods
thy
marshes
tameless
unbetrayed
all
virgin
of
the
spoiler
all
inviolate
in
beauty
undeflowered
where
fear
was
not
nor
hate
thou
knowest
lord
of
all
how
that
sanct
solitude
was
crowded
with
brave
life
a
thousand
forms
of
good
enjoying
thy
sweet
air
some
strong
some
weak
yet
none
oppressor
of
the
rest
more
than
thy
writ
might
run
armed
were
they
yet
restrained
not
even
the
lion
slew
his
prey
in
wantonness
nor
claimed
beyond
his
due
he
thinned
their
ranks
yet
lo
the
spring
brought
back
their
joy
short
was
his
anger
lord
he
raged
not
to
destroy
oh
noble
was
the
world
its
balance
held
by
thee
timely
its
fruits
for
all
thy
sole
sovereignty
but
he
he
the
unclean
the
fault
lord
god
was
thine
behold
him
in
thy
place
a
presence
saturnine
in
stealth
among
the
rest
equipped
as
none
of
these
with
thy
mind
attributes
low
crouched
beneath
the
trees
betraying
all
and
each
the
wit
thou
gavest
him
he
useth
to
undo
to
bend
them
to
his
whim
his
bodily
strength
is
little
slow
of
foot
is
he
of
stature
base
unclad
in
mail
or
panoply
his
heart
hath
a
poor
courage
he
hath
beauty
none
bare
to
the
buttocks
he
of
all
that
might
atone
without
thy
favour
lord
what
power
had
he
for
ill
without
thy
prompting
voice
his
violence
had
scant
skill
the
snare
the
sling
the
lime
who
taught
him
these
but
thou
the
world
was
lost
through
thee
who
fashioned
him
his
bow
and
thou
hast
clean
forgot
the
fair
great
beasts
of
yore
the
mammoth
aurochs
elk
boar
which
fell
before
his
hand
each
one
of
them
than
he
nobler
and
mightier
far
undone
by
treachery
he
spared
them
not
old
young
calf
cow
with
pitfall
hid
in
their
mid
path
they
fell
by
his
guile
harvested
and
with
them
the
world
truth
henceforth
all
walked
in
fear
knowing
that
one
there
was
turned
traitor
haply
near
this
was
the
wild
man
crime
the
lord
god
he
erred
in
ignorance
as
yet
he
was
not
man
naught
but
his
form
was
man
satan
well
had
he
so
remained
lord
god
thou
thoughtest
then
to
perfect
him
by
grace
among
the
sons
of
men
to
choose
a
worthiest
man
if
he
should
know
saidst
thou
the
evil
from
the
good
the
thing
we
do
allow
from
that
we
do
forbid
if
we
should
give
him
shame
the
consciousness
of
wrong
the
red
blush
under
blame
if
he
should
walk
in
light
beholding
truth
as
we
thou
gavest
him
conscience
creed
responsibility
the
power
to
worship
thee
thou
showedst
him
thy
way
thou
didst
reveal
thyself
thou
spakest
as
one
should
say
conversing
mouth
to
mouth
old
adam
and
his
eve
thou
didst
array
in
aprons
thy
own
hands
did
weave
enoch
was
taken
up
to
noah
thou
didst
send
salvation
in
thine
ark
lord
abraham
was
thy
friend
these
are
the
facts
recorded
facts
say
fables
yet
impressed
with
the
large
truth
of
a
new
value
set
upon
man
race
and
kind
by
thy
too
favouring
will
man
had
become
a
soul
informed
for
good
and
ill
with
thy
best
attributes
earth
moral
arbiter
tyrant
and

woe
and
alas
for

of
the
deeds
of
man
the
sins
no
wilding
now
but
set
in
cities
proud
yet
marked
upon
his
brow
with
label
of
all
crime
the
lord

the
men
before
the
flood
we
did
destroy
them
all
satan
save
noah
and
his
brood
in
what
were
these
more
worthy
did
they
love
thee
more
the
men
of
the
new

was
their
sin
less
sore
their
service
of
more
zeal
nay
earth
was
hardly
dry
ere
their
corruption
stank
and
their
sin
sulphurously
rose
as
a
smoke
to

ur

nineveh
the
cities
of

bethink
thee
lord
what
their
debasement
was
who
did
defile
thy
face
and
flout
thee
in
derision

in
shamelessness
the

but
there
loved

satan
ay
job
he
stands
in
light
of
the
new
gospel
captain
of
thy
bands
and
prince
of
all
that
served
thee
fearing
not
to
find
thy
justice
even
in
wrong
with
no
new
life
behind
thy
justice
even
in
death
in
all
four
men
of
good
of
the
whole
race
of
shem
heaven
stars
in
multitude
i
speak
of
the
old
time
and
the
one
chosen
nation
to
whom
thou
gavest
the
law
the
lord
god
truce
to
that
dispensation
it
was
an
old
world
hope
made
void
by
jacob
guile
his
was
a
bitter
stem
we
bore
with
it
awhile
too
long
till
we
grew
weary
but
enough
is
done
what
sayest
thou
of
the
new
most
wise
apollyon
satan
ah
lord
wilt
thou
believe
me
that
was
a
mighty
dream
sublime
of
a
world
won
by
thy
son
stratagem
of
being
himself
a
man
the
rueful
outcast
thing
and
of
all
men
a
jew
for
poor
earth
ransoming
thrice
glorious
inspiration
who
but
he
had
dared
come
naked
as
he
came
of
all
his
kingship
bared
not
one
of
us
to
serve
him
neither
praised
nor
proud
but
just
as
the
least
are
the
last
ones
of
the
crowd
he
had
not
man
fierce
eye
no
beast
fell
back
abashed
to
meet
him
in
the
woods
as
though
a
flame
had
flashed
he
lay
down
with
the
foxes
the
quails
went
and
came
between
his
feet
asleep
they
did
not
fear
his
blame
he
had
not
man
hard
heart
he
had
not
man
false
hand
his
gesture
was
as
theirs
their
wit
could
understand
he
was
their
fellow
flesh
to
him
so
near
to
god
what
difference
lay
man
and
the
least
herb
he
trod
he
came
to
save
them
to
win
to
his
peace
what
cared
he
for
man
jew
more
than
the
least
of
these
and
yet
he
loved
his
kind
the
sick
at
heart
the
poor
the
impotent
of
will
those
who
from
wrong
forbore
those
without
arms
to
strike
the
lost
of
israel
of
these
he
made
his
kingdom
as
it
pleased
him
well
kingdom
without
a
king
his
thought
was
to
bring
back
earth
to
its
earlier
way
ere
man
had
left
the
track
and
stay
his
rage
to
slay
take
ye
no

of
what
the
day
may
bring

as
the

guileless
of
all
gall
if

shall
smite
you

who
shepherding
thy

no

hath
nor

of

who

whom
there

no

where

him
the

after

they

long
the

he
had
made
whole
the
wronged
consoled
of
wrong
the
women
he
had
loved
the
fisher
folk
whose
ears
had
drunk
in
his
word
wisdom
those
three
wondrous
years
and
deemed
him
prophet
prince
his
kingdom
yet
to
come
nay
from
the
grave
and
had
been
seen
of
some
what
did
they
teach
awhile
they
told
his
law
of
peace
his
rule
of
unresistance
and
sweet
guilelessness
his
truce
with
mother
earth
his
abstinence
from
toil
his
love
of
the
least
life
that
wanton
hands
despoil
the
glory
of
his
tears
his
watching
fasting
prayer
the
patience
of
his
death
his
last
word
of
despair
and
as
he
lived
they
lived
awhile
expectant
still
of
his
return
in
power
to
balance
the
earth
ill
they
would
not
deem
him
dead
but
when
he
came
not
lo
their
reason
went
astray
poor
souls
they
loved
him
so
they
had
such
grief
for
him
their
one
true
god
in
man
revealed
to
their
sad
eyes
in
all
a
world
grown
wan
that
they
must
build
a
creed
a
refuge
from
their
fears
in
his
remembered
words
and
so
assuage
their
tears
his
kingdom
it
was
what
not
all
a
dream
forbid
that
fault
that
failure
heaven
for
such
were
death
indeed
his
promises
of
peace
goodwill
on
earth
to
men
which
needed
a
fulfilment
lest
faith
fail
how
then
since
no
fulfilment
came
since
he
had
left
them
lone
in
face
of
the
world
wolves
for
bread
had
given
a
stone
how
reconcile
his
word
with
that
which
was
their
life
man
hatred
and
god
silence
in
a
world
of
strife
was
there
no
path
no
way
nay
none
on
this
sad
earth
save
with
their
lord
to
suffer
and
account
it
mirth
and
so
awhile
they
grieved
then
rose
a
subtlety
lord
god
thou
knowest
not
wholly
how
men
crave
to
lie
in
face
of
a
hard
truth
too
grievous
to
their
pride
to
these
poor
fisher
folk
thus
of
their
lord
denied
came
a
new
blinding
vision
they
had
seen
thy
son
how
often
after
death
no
ghost
no
carrion
but
a
plain
man
alive
who
moved
among
them
slow
and
showed
his
feet
and
hands
the
thorn
prints
on
his
brow
the
spear
wound
in
his
side
he
had
come
to
comfort
them
confirm
them
in
the
faith
by
his
love
stratagem
how
if
this
thing
were
real
if
this
that
proved
him
god
proved
also
themselves
spirits
not
mere
flesh
and
blood
one
with
the
beasts
that
perish
but
immortal
souls
even
as
we
angels
are
who
fill
heaven
muster
rolls
and
so
shall
live
for
aye
here
argued
they
it
stands
the
kingdom
of
his
heaven
a
house
not
made
with
hands
wherein
we
too
but
in
no
earthly
case
shall
enter
after
death
on
this
fair
fragile
base
their
sorrow
built
its
nest
it
gave
a
hope
to
men
and
pandered
to
their
pride
and
lo
the
world
disdain
was
changed
to
acclamation
kings
and
emperors
kneeled
before
the
crucified

thy

reformed
none

yet
is

as
sore
lord
hear
me
to
the

thou
dravest
me
out
of
yore
an
exile
from
thy
sight
with
mission
to
undo
and
tempt
man
to
his
death
i
had
fallen
from
heaven
blue
by
reason
of
my
pride
thou
wouldst
have
service
done
unreasoning
on
the
knees
as
flowers
bend
to
the
sun
which
withers
them
at
noon
nor
ask
of
his
white
fires
why
they
consume
and
slay
i
had
fallen
by
my
desires
which
were
too
large
for
one
not
god
because
i
would
have
shewn
thee
the
truth
bare
in
no
similitude
as
a
slave
flattering
speaks
and
half
despises
him
he
fawns
on
but
in
love
which
stands
erect
of
limb
claiming
an
equal
part
which
reasons
questions
dares
and
calls
all
by
its
name
the
wheat
wheat
the
tares
tares
the

friend
the

foe
thou
wast
displeased
at
this
and
deemed
i
envied
man
his
portion
in
thy
bliss
the
man
that
thou
hadst
made
and
in
thy
royal
faith
held
worthy
of
all
trust
thy
lord
of
life
and
death
one
to
be
proved
and
tried
as
gold
is
tried
by
fire
and
fare
the
purer
forth
of
me
thou
didst
require
the
sad
task
of
his
tempting
i
forsooth
must
sue
and
prompt
to
evil
deeds
make
the
false
thought
seem
true
the
true
thought
false
that
he
thus
proved
thus
tried
might
turn
and
hurl
me
a
dog
word
as
jesus
did
in
scorn
get
thee
behind
me
satan
to
this
penance
chained
i
bowed
me
in
despair
as
thou
lord
hadst
ordained
cast
out
from
thee
and
cursed
it
was
a
rueful
task
for
one
who
had
known
to
wear
the
felon
mask
and
tempt
this
piteous
child
to
his
base
sins
of
greed
his
lusts
ignoble
crimes
how
prompt
in
act
and
deed
to
urge
him
to
rebellion
against
god
and
good
who
needed
none
to
urge
his
savage
simian
blood
flamed
at
a
word
a
sign
he
lied
he
thieved
he
slew
by
instinct
of
his
birth
no
virtue
but
he
knew
its
countervice
and
foil
without
my
wit
to
aid
no
fair
thought
but
he
chose
the
foul
thought
in
its
stead
ah
sad
primæval
race
thou
saidst
it
was
not
man
this
thing
armed
with
the
stone
which
through
thy
forests
ran
intent
to
snare
and
slay
not

the
senseless
knave
who
struck
fire
from
his
flint
to
burn
thy
gorses
brave
thy
heaths
for
his
lean
kine
who
being
the
one
unclean
defiled
thy
earth
with
ordure
heaps
obscene
to
plant
his
rice
his
rye
not
man
saidst
thou
because
he
knew
not
of
thy
way
nor
had
he
learned
thy
laws
and
was
stark
savage
still
not
man
behold
thy
tamed
man
as
he
lives
thy
son
of
japhet
nay
thy
new

the
follower
of
thy

who
sweareth
by

went
in

even

i
will
expound
this
thing
the
creed
of
these
white
thieves
which
boast
of
thee
their
king
as
partner
in
their
crimes
the
head
knaves
of
the

those
who
inspire
the

and
give
the

the
leaders
of
their

their

political
sages
kings

priests
in
their

one

for
all
their
faith
avowed
and
their

done
in

of
thy
high
fires
each

beneath
the
sun
ay
and
their
prelates
too
their
men
of
godliest
worth
believe
no
word
of
thee
as
master
of
their
earth
controller
of
their
acts
no
word
of
thy
high
right
to
bend
men
to
obedience
and
at
need
to
smite
no
word
of
thy
true
law
the
enforcement
of
thy
peace
thy
arm
in
the
world
policies
they
ignore
thee
on
the
earth
they
grant
thee
as
their
god
the
kingdom
of
the
heavens
seeing
it
a
realm
untrod
untreadable
by
man
a
space
a
or
land
which
they
as
loyal
men
and
pious
leave
and
assign
to
thee
to
deal
with
as
thou
wilt
to
hold
as
thy
strong
throne
or
loose
as
water
spilt
for
sun

to

in
the

of

whether
of
a
truth
thou
they
know
not
lord
nor
care
only
they
name
thee
god
and
pay
thee
their
prayers
vain
as
dormant
and
pensioned
suzerain
the
mediatised
blind
monarch
of
a
world
outgrown
of
its
faith
swaddling
clothes
which
wills
to
walk
alone
the
earth
not
so
is
theirs
the
prize
of
the
strong
hand
the
strongest
being
their
own
by
sea
alike
and
land
thy
will
be
done
they
cry
father
which
art
in
heaven
where
thou
canst
harm
nor
hurt
not
one
day
in
the
seven
and
if
they
add
on
earth
they
deem
thee
impotent
seeing
thee
drowse
thus
long
and
leave
men
to
their
bent
they
mean
thy
will
in
heaven
or
in
their
world
to
come
terram

so
think
their
chiefs
their
lords
for
the
blind
mass
of
men
which
live
and
toil
and
die
in
their
pen
they
have
no
god
but
gold
the
lord
of
their
distress
and
gold
slave
drink
that
buys
a
night
forgetfulness
of
thee
they
have
no
heed
to
chide
them
or
to
cheer
the
fear
of
thee
with
these
is
their
law
officer
lord
god
if
thou
but
saw
the
pagan
hearts
they
hide
the
base
greeds
of
their
being
the
lusts
undenied
the
mammons
that
they
worship
but
thou
dost
not
see
or
thou
hadst
purged
long
since
this
worst
profanity
from
the
world
better
way
and
thereby
saved
thy
name
profaned
in
their
foul
mouths
from
its
long
daily
shame
thou
dost
not
hear
nor
see
the
smoke
of
their
foul
dens
broodeth
on
thy
fair
earth
as
a
black
pestilence
hiding
the
kind
day
eye
no
flower
no
grass
there
groweth
only
their
engines
dung
which
the
fierce
furnace
throweth
their
presence
poisoneth
all
and
maketh
all
unclean
thy
streams
they
have
made
sewers
for
their

aniline
no
fish
therein
may
swim
no
frog
no
worm
may
crawl
no
snail
for
grime
may
build
her
house
within
their

thy
beasts
they
have
enslaved
in
blindness
underground
the
voice
of
birds
that
sang
to
them
is
a
lost
sound
nay
they
have
tarred
time
features
nature
face
brought
all
to
the
same
jakes
with
their
own
lack
of
grace
in
all
thy
living
world
there
is
no
sentient
thing
polluteth
and
defileth
as
this
saxon
king
this
intellectual
lord
and
sage
of
the
new
quest
the
only
wanton
he
that
fouleth
his
own
nest
and
still
his
boast
goeth
forth
nay
lord
is
shame
to
thee
this
slave
being
what
he
is
should
ape
divinity
the
poorest
saddest
drudge
the
least
heart
in
all
a
world
where
tears
are
sold
in
open
mart
that
he
should
stand
thy
choice
to
preach
thy
law
and
set
his
impress
on
the
earth
in
full
apostolate
thy
missioner
and
priest
he
goeth
among
the
nations
saith
he
to
spread
thy
truth
to
preach
thy
law
of
patience
to
glorify
thy
name
not
selfishly
forsooth
but
for
their
own
more
good
to
open
them
the
truth
to
teach
them
happiness
to
civilise
to
save
to
smite
down
the
oppressor
and
make
free
the
slave
to
bear
the
white
man
burden
which
he
yearns
to
take
on
his
white
saxon
back
for
his
white
conscience
sake
huge
impudent
imposture
lord
there
were
fair
lands
once
on
thy
earth
brave
hills
bright
isles
sweet
coral
strands
noble
savannahs
plains
of
limitless
waving
green
lakes
girt
with
giant
forests
continents
unseen
unknown
by
these
white
thieves
where
men
lived
in
the
way
of
thy
good
natural
law
with
thy
free
beasts
at
play
and
partners
with
thy
birds
men
who
nor
toiled
nor
span
nor
sowed
nor
reaped
nor
delved
for
the
red
curse
of
man
the
gold
that
kills
the
soul
who
knew
nought
of
the
fire
which
in
his
guns
he
storeth
naught
of
the
desire
more
deadly
still
concealed
in
his
fire
drink
of
death
who
went
unclothed
unshamed
for
garment
a
flower
wreath
whose
women
lived
unsold
and
loved
their
natural
kin
nor
gave
aught
to
the
stranger
in
the
wage
of
sin
who
blessed
thee
for
their
babes
and
through
the
woods
like
eve
wandered
in
happy
laughter
glorying
to
conceive
yea
lord
and
there
were
others
shut
communities
of
souls
still
on
thy
path
and
strange
to
the
new
lies
yet
not
as
these
were
wild
but
held
in
discipline
of
orderly
commandment
servants
true
of
thine
and
doers
of
thy
law
but
ignorant
untaught
save
by
an
inward
grace
of
thought
and
light
intuitive
no
shedders
they
of
blood
but
with
all
creatures
friends
with
men
in
brotherhood
blameless
of
wine
of
strife
in
innocent
arts
well
skilled
but
schoolless
of
all
guile
as
an
unchristened
child
to
these
with

fine

the
white
gospellers
our
saxon

our
law
hath
given
us
three
three
gods
to
one
sole

these
pagans
are
blasphemers
who
is
on
our
side
see

have
gold
to
give
we
may
not
be
denied
and
they
baptise
them
christians

no

the
white
man
hates
a
liar
and
hates
a
grumbling
hand
enough
if
we
provide
tools
with
the
drink
and
leave
your
backs
with
a
whole
hide
these
lands
are
ours
by
charter
if
you
doubt
it
bring
your
case
before
the
courts
which
will
expound
the
thing
as
for
your
women
folk
look
there
are
ways
well
known
all
women
have
of
living
in
a
christian
town
moreover
you
do
one
wife
the
law
allows
and
you
you
say
have
four
send
three
round
to
our
house
thus
is
thy
gospel
preached
its
issue
lord
behold
in
the
five
continents
the
new
world
and
the
old
the
happier
tribes
of
man
despoiled
enslaved
betrayed
to
the
sole
white
man
lust
husband
and
wife
and
maid
their
laughter
drowned
in
tears
their
kindness
in
mad
wrath
their
dignity
of
joy
in
a
foul
trance
of
death
till
at
the
last
they
turn
and
in
their
anguish
rend
then
loud
the
cry
goeth
forth
the
white
man
to
each
friend
help
christians
to
our
help
these
black
fiends
murder
us
and
the
last
scene
is
played
in
death
red
charnel
house
the
saxon
anger
flames
his
ships
in
armament
bear
slaughter
on
their
wings
the
earth
with
fire
is
rent
and
the
poor
souls
misused
are
wiped
from
the
world
face
in
one
huge
imprecation
from
the
saxon
race
in
one
huge
burst
of
prayer
and
insolent
praise
to
thee
lord
god
for
thy
high
help
and
proved
complicity
nay
lord
is
not
a
lie
the
thing
i
tell
thee
thus
their
bishops
in
their
churches
lead
incredulous
the
public
thanks
profane
they
sanctify
the
sword
te
deum
laudamus
give
peace
in
our
time
o
lord
hast
thou
not
heard
their
chanting
nay
thou
dost
not
hear
or
thou
hadst
loosed
thy
hand
like
lightning
in
the
clear
to
smite
their
ribald
lips
with
palsy
these
false
priests
these
lords
who
boast
thine
aid
at
their
high
civic
feasts
the
ignoble
shouting
crowds
the
prophets
of
their
press
pouring
their
daily
flood
of
bald
their
poets
who
write
big
of
the
white
burden
trash
the
white

burden
lord
is
the
burden
of
his

there
thou
hast
heard
the

thy

lord
god
of
heaven
lieth
in
the
hands
of
thieves
who
pillage
morn
and
even
and
thou
still
sleepest
on
nay
but
thou
needs
must
hear
or
abdicate
thy
name
of
high
justiciar
henceforward
and
for
ever
it
thee
with
more
than
temporal
shame
thy
silence
is
a
sea
crying
through
all
the
spheres
in
pain
and
ceasing
not
as
blood
from
out
the
ground
to
mark
crime
murder
spot
there
is
no
hope
no
truth
he
hath
betrayed
the

is
unjust
the

is
unjust
cry
this
is
their
cry
in

who
give
thee
service
true
arise
lord
and
avenge
as
was
thy
wont
to
do
angels
in

the

what

what

my

then
no

who
loudly
witnesseth

ruin
of
the

the
angel
of

lord
it
is
even
so
thy
earth
is
a
lost
force
man
of
woe
undone
by
his
lewd
will
we
may
no
longer
strive
the
evil
hath
prevailed
there
is
no
soul
alive
that
shall
escape
his
greed
we
spend
our
days
in
tears
mourning
thy

lost
beauty
in
the
night
of
years
all

is
departed
each
once

that
on

how
glorious
in
its
strength
how
wondrous
in

how
royal
in

the

from
the
remote
fair
past
when
still
ignoble
man
on
his

howled
through
the
lone
hills
in
moody
bestial
wrath
unclassed
among
earth
ills
each
one
of
them
is
doomed
from
the
deep
central

to
the
white
poles
man

for
his

the

amorous
seal
he
flayeth

thou
hearest
them
lord
god
the
lord
god
good
satan
i
have
heard
thou
art
more
just
than
i
alas
more
just
than
i
the
angels
behold
the
lord
god
weepeth
the
angel
of
pity
what
eyes
should
be
dry
if
for
a
crime
eyes
weep
this
crime
transcendeth
crime
and
the
lord
god
hath
pity
in
his
own
good
time
the
lord
god
alas
the
time
is
late
i
do
repent
me
sore
the
wrong
i
did
thee
satan
in
those
griefs
of
yore
the
wrong
i
did
the
earth
yet
is
eternity
a
long
day
for
atonement
thou
thyself
shalt
be
my
instrument
here
of
wrath
to
purge
this
race
of
man
and
cast
him
on
time
dunghill
whence
he
first
began
what
angel
is
thy
counsel
shall
we
unseal
again
the
fountains
of
the
heavens
send
our
outpoured
rain
and
flood
him
with
new
waters
shall
it
be
by
fire
shall
we
embraize
the
earth
in
one
vast
funeral
pyre
by
impact
of
a
star
let
loose
a
sulphurous
wind
belch
rocks
from
the
earth
bowels
shall
we
strike
man
blind
with
an
unbearable
light
shall
we
so
shake
the
hills
the
plains
that
he
fall
palsied
grind
him
in
the
mills
of
a
perpetual
hail
importune
him
with
snow
scourge
him
with
noise
unceasing
or
the
glutinous
flow
of
a
long
pestilent
stench
speak
satan
all
thy
thought
thou
who
the
traitor
knowest
how
may
he
be
brought
best
to
annihilation
satan
lord
by
none
of
these
thy
floods
thy
flames
thy
storms
were
puerilities
he
hath
too
large
a
cunning
to
be
taken
thus
he
would
outride
thy
waves
outblast
thy
sulphurous
winds
with
his
he
liveth
on
foul
air
as
on
the
breath
of
heaven
he
hath
nor
thought
nor
care
for
thy
worst
lightning
strokes
holding
their
principle
in
his
own
hand
all
natural
powers
fulfil
his
brain
omnipotence
he
standeth
at
each
point
armed
for
defiant
war
in
harness
without
joint
though
thou
shouldst
break
the
earth
in
twain
he
should
not
bend
thou
needest
a
force
to
aid
thee
an
ally
a
friend
a
principle
of
good
which
shall
outwit
his
guile
with
true
white
guilelessness
his
anger
with
a
smile
his
force
with
utter
weakness
only
thus
lord
god
shalt
thou
regain
thy
earth
a
purified
abode
and
rid
it
of
the
human
the
lord
god
and
the
means
thy
plan
needeth
a
new
redemption
satan
ay
but
not
of
man
he
is
beyond
redeeming
or
thy
son
had
died
not
wholly
to
this
loss
who
would
be
crucified
must
choose
another
a
young
fleshly
form
free
from
the
simian
taint
were
it
but
flower
or
worm
or
limpet
of
the
rock
or
grieving
nightingale
wherein
to
preach
his
gospel
yet
should
he
prevail
if
only
for
truth
sake
and
that
this
latest
lie
should
be
laid
bare
to
shame
time
fraud
humanity
choose
thee
an
angel
lord
it
were
enough
thy
son
was
a
price
all
too
great
even
had
the
world
been
won
nor
can
it
be
again
an
angel
shall
suffice
for
thy
new
second
sending
so
thou
guide
the
choice
to
a
more
reasoned
issue
so
thou
leave
mankind
henceforth
to
his
sole
ways
as
at
his
outset
blind
to
all
but
his
own
lusts
untutored
by
thy
grace
this
is
the
road
lord
god
i
bow
before
thy
face
i
make
thee
my
submission
to
do
all
thy
will
so
thou
absolve
and
pardon
the
lord
god
o
incomparable
good
servant
satan
thou
art
absolved
indeed
it
was
right
to
pardon
thy
god
lack
of
heed
his
wrath
at
thy
wise
counsel
nay
thou
shamest
me
be
thou
absolved
good
angel
ego
absolvo
te
ab
omnibus
peccatis
once
more
be
it
thy
right
to
stand
before
god
throne
for
ever
in
his
sight
and
trusted
more
than
these
speak
satan
what
thou
wilt
all
shall
be
granted
thee
the
glory
with
the
guilt
of
the
earth
lost
and
won
who
is
it
thou
wouldst
send
agent
and
messenger
to
work
to
this
new
end
what
angel
of
them
all
i
pledge
thee
my
full
faith
it
shall
be
as
thou
wilt
satan
who
goeth
must
die
the
death
since
death
is
all
life
law
and
taste
of
corporal
pain
and
whoso
dieth
must
die
nor
think
to
live
again
the
lord
god
shall
it
be
michael
speak
satan
nay
lord
nor
gabriel
they
are
thy
servants
tried
who
love
thy
heaven
too
well
thou
shalt
not
drive
them
forth
to
the
wild
wastes
of
earth
what
should
they
do
lord
god
with
a
terrestrial
birth
with
less
than
thy
long
joys
nay
rather
choose
thee
one
already
marred
with
grief
with
time
disunion
one
all
too
sad
for
heaven
to
whom
eternity
is
as
a
charge
who
hath
no
fear
to
die
but
gladly
would
lie
down
and
be
for
aye
no
more
the
flotsam
of
time
waves
upon
death
outer
shore
forgotten
and
forgetting
grant
me
lord
god
this
in
penance
for
the
past
death
full
forgetfulness
the
lord
god
and
thou
wouldst
be
incarnate
satan
as
the
least
strong
thing
the
frailest
the
most
fond
an
insect
on
the
wind
which
shall
prevail
by
love
by
ignorance
by
lack
of
all
that
man
most
trusteth
to
secure
his
back
to
arm
his
hand
with
might
what
thy
son
dreamed
of
man
will
i
work
out
anew
as
some
poor
cateran
the
weakest
of
the
earth
with
only
beauty
power
and
thy
good
grace
to
aid
the
creature
of
an
hour
too
fugitive
for
fight
too
frail
even
far
to
fly
and
at
the
hour
end
lord
to
close
my
wings
and
die
such
were
the
new
redemption
the
lord
god
thou
good
angel
nay
the
world
were
all
unworthy
such
high
price
to
pay
i
will
not
have
thee
die
satan
is
not
for
the
world
sake
lord
god
of
heaven
and
earth
that
i
petition
make
but
for
thy
justice
foiled
it
irketh
me
to
know
that
i
have
tutored
man
against
thee
to
this
woe
and
given
him
sure
success
yet
is
the
world
self
good
and
i
would
prove
it
thee
lest
man
ingratitude
should
so
affect
all
truth
all
honour
all
high
faith
that
thou
thyself
lord
god
shouldst
fall
a
prey
to
death
and
leave
him
in
dominion
what
to
me
were
heaven
with
this
thought
unappeased
even
thus
absolved
forgiven
yet
by
myself
condemned
the
lord
god
ah
satan
thy
old
pride
still
lingereth
in
the
clefts
yet
art
thou
not
denied
since
i
have
sworn
thee
faith
go
thou
good
messenger
and
god
peace
go
with
thee
ho
ye
without

ear
bow
down
to
the

our
anointed
priest
