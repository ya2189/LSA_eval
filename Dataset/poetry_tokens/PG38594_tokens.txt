the
supreme
problem
of
every
age
is
that
of
finding
its
consummate
artistic
expression
before
this
problem
every
other
remains
of
secondary
importance
history
defines
and
directs
its
physical
course
science
cooperates
in
the
achievement
of
its
material
aims
but
art
alone
gives
to
the
age
its
spiritual
physiognomy
its
ultimate
and
lasting
expression
the
process
of
art
is
on
the
one
hand
sensuous
the
conception
having
for
its
basis
the
fineness
of
organization
of
the
senses
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
severely
scientific
the
value
of
the
creation
being
dependent
upon
the
craftsmanship
the
mastery
over
the
tool
the
technique
art
like
nature
its
great
and
only
reservoir
for
all
time
past
and
all
time
to
come
ever
strives
for
elimination
and
selection
it
is
severe
and
aristocratic
in
the
application
of
its
laws
and
impervious
to
appeal
to
serve
other
than
its
own
aims
its
purpose
is
the
symbolization
of
life
in
its
sanctum
there
reigns
the
silence
of
vast
accomplishment
the
serene
final
and
imperturbable
solitude
which
is
the
ultimate
criterion
of
all
great
things
created
to
speak
of
poetry
is
to
speak
of
the
most
subtle
the
most
delicate
and
the
most
accurate
instrument
by
which
to
measure
life
poetry
is
reality
essence
visioned
and
made
manifest
by
one
endowed
with
a
perception
acutely
sensitive
to
sound
form
and
colour
and
gifted
with
a
power
to
shape
into
rhythmic
and
rhymed
verbal
symbols
the
reaction
to
life
phenomena
the
poet
moulds
that
which
appears
evanescent
and
ephemeral
in
image
and
in
mood
into
everlasting
values
in
this
act
of
creation
he
serves
eternity
poetry
in
especial
lyrical
poetry
must
be
acknowledged
the
supreme
art
culminating
as
it
does
in
a
union
of
the
other
arts
the
musical
the
plastic
and
the
pictorial
the
most
eminent
contemporary
poets
of
europe
have
each
in
accordance
with
his
individual
temperament
reflected
in
their
work
the
spiritual
essence
of
our
age
its
fears
and
failures
its
hopes
and
high
achievements
maeterlinck
with
his
mood
of
resignation
and
his
retirement
into
a
dusky
twilight
where
his
shadowy
figures
move
noiselessly
like
phantoms
in
dimness
dehmel
the
worshipper
of
will
with
his
passion
for
materiality
and
the
beauty
of
all
things
physical
and
tangible
verhaeren
the
visionary
of
a
new
vitality
who
sees
in
the
toilers
of
fields
and
factories
the
heroic
gesture
of
our
time
and
who
might
have
written
its
great
epic
of
industry
but
for
the
overwhelming
lyrical
mood
of
his
soul
until
a
few
years
ago
known
only
to
a
relatively
small
community
on
the
continent
but
commanding
an
ever
increasing
attention
which
has
borne
his
name
far
beyond
the
boundary
of
his
country
the
personality
of
rainer
maria
rilke
stands
beside
the
most
illustrious
poets
of
modern
europe
the
background
against
which
the
figure
of
rainer
maria
rilke
is
silhouetted
is
so
varied
the
influences
which
have
entered
into
his
life
are
so
manifold
that
a
study
of
his
work
however
slight
must
needs
take
into
consideration
the
elements
through
which
this
poet
has
matured
into
a
great
master
prague
the
city
in
which
rilke
was
born
in
with
its
sinister
palaces
and
crumbling
towers
that
rose
in
the
early
middle
ages
and
have
reached
out
into
our
time
like
the
threatening
fingers
of
mighty
hands
which
have
wielded
swords
for
generations
and
which
are
stained
with
the
blood
of
many
wounds
of
many
races
the
city
where
amid
grey
old
ruins
blonde
maidens
are
at
play
or
are
lost
in
reverie
in
the
green
cool
parks
and
shady
gardens
with
which
the
bohemian
capital
abounds
this
prague
of
mingled
grotesqueness
and
beauty
gave
to
the
young
boy
his
first
impressions
there
is
a
period
in
the
life
of
every
artist
when
his
whole
being
seems
lost
in
a
contemplation
of
the
surrounding
world
when
the
application
to
work
is
difficult
like
the
violent
forcing
of
something
that
is
awaiting
its
time
this
is
the
time
of
his
dream
as
sacred
as
the
days
of
early
spring
before
wind
and
rain
and
light
have
touched
the
fruits
of
the
fields
when
there
is
a
tense
bleak
silence
over
the
whole
of
nature
in
which
is
wrapped
the
strength
of
storms
and
the
glow
of
the
summer
sun
this
is
the
time
of
his
deepest
dream
and
upon
this
dream
and
its
guarding
depends
the
final
realization
of
his
life
work
the
young
graduate
of
the
gymnasium
was
to
enter
upon
the
career
of
an
army
officer
in
accordance
with
the
traditions
of
the
family
an
old
noble
house
which
traces
its
lineage
far
back
to
carinthian
ancestry
his
inclinations
however
pointed
so
decisively
in
the
direction
of
the
finer
arts
of
life
that
he
left
the
military
academy
after
a
very
short
attendance
to
devote
himself
to
the
study
of
philosophy
and
the
history
of
art
as
one
turns
the
pages
of
rilke
first
small
book
of
poems
published
originally
under
the
title
in
the
year
and
which
appeared
in
more
recent
editions
under
the
less
descriptive
name
one
realizes
at
once
in
spite
of
a
lack
of
plasticity
in
the
presentation
that
here
speaks
one
who
has
lingered
long
and
lovingly
over
the
dream
of
his
boyhood
as
the
title
indicates
these
poems
are
a
tribute
an
offering
to
the
lares
the
home
spirits
of
his
native
town
prague
and
the
surrounding
country
are
the
ever
recurring
theme
of
almost
every
one
of
these
poems
the
meadows
the
maidens
the
dark
river
in
the
evening
the
spires
of
the
cathedral
at
night
rising
like
grey
mists
are
seen
with
a
wonderment
the
great
of
all
poetic
imagination
with
a
religious
piety
through
all
these
poems
there
sounds
like
a
subdued
accompaniment
a
note
of
gratitude
for
the
ability
to
thus
vision
the
world
to
be
sunk
in
the
music
of
all
things
without
is
everything
that
i
feel
within
myself
and
without
and
within
myself
everything
is
immeasurable
illimitable
these
pictures
of
town
and
landscape
are
never
separated
from
their
personal
relation
to
the
poet
he
feels
too
keenly
his
dependence
upon
them
as
a
child
views
flowers
and
stars
as
personal
possessions
not
until
later
was
he
to
reach
the
height
of
an
impersonal
objectivity
in
his
art
what
distinguishes
these
early
poems
from
similar
adolescent
productions
is
the
restraint
in
the
presentation
the
economy
and
intensity
of
expression
and
that
quality
of
listening
to
the
inner
voice
of
things
which
renders
the
poet
the
seer
of
mankind
the
second
book
of
poems
appeared
two
years
later
and
like
the
first
volume
is
full
of
the
music
that
is
reminiscent
of
the
mild
melancholy
of
the
bohemian
in
whose
gentle
rhythms
the
barbaric
strength
of
the
race
seems
to
be
lulled
to
rest
as
the
waves
of
a
tumultuous
sea
gently
lap
the
shore
the
themes
of
are
extended
somewhat
beyond
the
immediate
environment
of
prague
and
some
of
the
most
beautiful
poems
are
luminous
pictures
of
villages
hidden
in
the
snowy
blossoming
of
may
and
june
out
of
which
rises
here
and
there
the
solitary
soft
voice
of
a
boy
or
girl
singing
in
these
first
two
volumes
the
poet
is
satisfied
with
painting
in
words
full
of
sonorous
beauty
the
surrounding
world
from
this
period
dates
the
small
poem
which
seems
to
have
been
sketched
by
a
japanese
painter
so
clear
and
colourful
is
its
texture
so
precious
and
precise
are
its
outlines
with
and
zur
both
published
within
the
following
three
years
a
phase
of
questioning
commences
a
dim
desire
begins
to
stir
to
reach
out
into
the
larger
world
deep
into
life
out
beyond
time
whereas
the
early
poems
were
characterized
by
a
tendency
to
turn
away
from
the
turmoil
of
life
in
fact
the
concrete
world
of
reality
does
not
seem
to
exist
there
is
noticeable
in
these
two
later
volumes
an
advance
toward
life
in
the
sense
that
the
poet
is
beginning
to
approach
and
to
vision
some
of
its
greatest
symbols
throughout
the
entire
work
of
rilke
in
his
poetry
as
well
as
in
his
interpretations
of
painting
and
sculpture
there
are
two
elements
that
constitute
the
cornerstones
in
the
structure
of
his
art
if
as
has
been
said
with
a
degree
of
verity
nietzsche
was
primarily
a
musician
whose
philosophy
had
for
its
basis
and
took
its
ultimate
aspects
from
the
musical
quality
of
his
artistic
endowment
it
may
be
maintained
with
an
equal
amount
of
truth
that
rilke
is
primarily
a
painter
and
sculptor
whose
poetry
rests
upon
the
fundaments
of
the
pictorial
and
plastic
arts
up
to
the
time
of
the
publication
of
these
volumes
rilke
poems
possessed
a
quietude
a
stillness
suggested
in
the
straight
unbroken
yet
delicate
lines
of
the
picture
which
he
portrays
and
in
the
soft
almost
unpulsating
rhythm
of
his
words
the
approach
of
evening
or
nightfall
the
coming
of
dawn
the
change
of
the
seasons
the
slow
changes
of
light
into
darkness
and
of
darkness
into
light
in
short
the
most
silent
yet
greatest
metamorphoses
in
the
external
aspects
of
nature
form
the
contents
of
many
of
these
first
poems
the
inanimate
object
and
the
living
creature
in
nature
are
not
seen
in
the
sharp
contours
of
their
isolation
they
are
viewed
and
interpreted
in
the
atmosphere
that
surrounds
them
in
which
they
are
enwrapped
and
so
densely
veiled
that
the
outlines
are
only
dimly
visible
be
that
atmosphere
the
mystic
grey
of
northern
twilight
or
the
dark
velvety
blue
of
southern
summer
nights
in
the
experience
of
the
atmosphere
becomes
an
experience
in
his
innermost
soul
and
therefore
all
things
become
of
value
to
him
only
in
so
far
as
they
partake
of
the
atmosphere
as
they
are
seen
in
a
peculiar
air
and
distance
this
first
phase
in
rilke
work
may
be
defined
as
the
phase
of
reposeful
nature
to
this
sphere
of
relaxation
and
restfulness
in
which
the
objects
are
static
and
are
changed
only
as
the
surrounding
atmosphere
affects
them
the
second
phase
in
the
poet
development
adds
another
element
which
later
was
to
grow
into
dimensions
so
powerful
so
violently
breaking
beyond
the
limitations
of
simple
expression
in
words
that
it
could
only
find
its
satisfaction
in
a
dithyrambic
hymn
to
the
work
of
the
great
plastic
artist
of
our
time
to
the
creations
of
auguste
rodin
this
second
element
is
that
which
the
french
sculptor
in
a
different
medium
has
carried
to
perfection
it
is
the
element
of
gesture
of
dramatic
movement
this
might
seem
the
appropriate
place
in
which
to
speak
of
monograph
on
the
art
of
rodin
to
do
so
would
however
be
an
undue
anticipation
for
it
will
be
necessary
to
trace
rilke
development
through
several
transitions
before
the
value
of
his
contact
with
the
work
of
rodin
can
be
fully
measured
the
gesture
the
movement
begins
in
and
to
disturb
the
stillness
prevailing
in
the
first
two
volumes
of
poems
even
here
it
is
only
gentle
and
shy
at
first
like
the
stirring
of
a
breath
of
wind
over
a
quiet
sea
and
gentle
beings
make
this
first
gesture
children
and
young
women
at
play
singing
dancing
or
at
prayer
particularly
in
the
cycle
of
the
in
the
book
the
atmosphere
is
condensed
and
becomes
the
psychic
background
of
the
landscape
against
which
the
gesture
of
longing
or
expectation
is
seen
and
felt
it
is
the
impatience
to
burst
into
blossoming
the
longing
for
love
which
pulsates
in
these
of
the
with
the
tenseness
of
suspense
prayers
of
the
maidens
to
have
not
the
mild
melody
of
maidenly
prayer
they
vibrate
with
the
ecstasy
of
expectant
life
and
the
madonna
is
more
than
the
heavenly
virgin
their
longing
transforms
her
into
the
symbol
of
earthly
love
and
motherhood
this
expectation
in
spite
of
its
intensity
is
subdued
and
is
only
heard
like
the
cadence
of
a
far
off
dream
how
shall
i
go
on
tiptoe
from
childhood
to
annunciation
through
the
dim
twilight
into
thy
garden
mention
should
be
made
of
some
prose
writings
which
rilke
published
in
the
year
and
shortly
afterward
they
are
stories
of
touch
of
and
three
volumes
of
short
stories
a
drama
daily
points
to
a
strong
maeterlinck
influence
and
finally
of
with
both
beauty
of
detail
and
problematic
interest
the
short
stories
show
an
incoherence
of
treatment
and
a
lack
of
dramatic
easily
conceivable
in
a
poet
who
is
essentially
lyrical
and
who
at
that
time
had
not
mastered
the
means
of
technique
to
give
to
his
characters
the
clear
chiselling
of
the
epic
form
a
sojourn
in
russia
and
especially
the
acquaintance
with
the
novels
of
dostoievsky
became
potent
factors
in
rilke
development
and
served
to
deepen
creations
which
without
this
influence
might
have
terminated
in
a
grandiose
æsthesia
broadly
speaking
russian
art
and
literature
may
be
described
as
springing
from
an
ethical
impulse
and
as
having
for
their
motive
power
and
the
tendency
toward
reform
in
contradistinction
to
the
art
and
literature
of
western
culture
whose
motives
and
aims
are
primarily
of
an
æsthetic
nature
and
seek
in
art
the
reconciliation
of
the
dualism
between
spirit
and
matter
dostoievsky
whom
merejkovsky
describes
somewhere
as
the
man
with
the
face
the
face
with
its
shadows
of
suffering
and
its
wrinkles
of
cheeks
but
that
which
gives
to
this
face
its
most
tortured
expression
is
its
seeming
immobility
the
suddenly
interrupted
impulse
the
life
hardened
into
a
stone
this
dostoievsky
and
particularly
his
cycle
became
a
profound
artistic
experience
to
rilke
the
poor
the
outcasts
the
homeless
ones
received
for
him
a
new
significance
the
significance
of
the
isolated
figure
placed
in
the
mighty
everchanging
current
of
a
life
in
which
this
figure
stands
strong
and
solitary
in
the
poem
entitled
du
written
in
paris
a
few
years
later
rilke
has
visioned
the
blind
beggar
aloof
amid
the
fluctuating
crowds
of
the
metropolis
of
russia
and
its
influence
upon
him
rilke
writes
russia
became
for
me
the
reality
and
the
deep
daily
realization
that
reality
is
something
that
comes
infinitely
slowly
to
those
who
have
patience
russia
is
the
country
where
men
are
solitary
each
one
with
a
world
within
himself
each
one
profound
in
his
humbleness
and
without
fear
of
humiliating
himself
and
because
of
that
truly
pious
here
the
words
of
men
are
only
fragile
bridges
above
their
real
life
the
great
symbols
of

and
of
death
enter
into
the
poet
work
in
the
first
decade
of
the
new
century
rilke
reached
the
height
of
his
art
and
with
a
few
exceptions
the
poems
represented
in
this
volume
are
selected
from
the
poems
which
were
published
between
the
years
and
the
ascent
toward
the
acme
of
rilke
art
after
the
year
is
as
rapid
as
it
is
precipitous
only
a
few
years
previous
we
read
in
advent
that
is
longing
to
dwell
in
the
flux
of
things
to
have
no
home
in
the
present
and
these
are
wishes
gentle
dialogues
of
the
poor
hours
with
eternity
with
buch
der
the
dream
is
ended
the
veil
of
mist
is
lifted
and
before
us
are
revealed
pictures
and
images
that
rise
before
our
eyes
in
clear
colourful
contours
whether
the
poet
conjures
from
the
depths
of
myth
kings
in
or
whether
we
read
from
chronicle
of
a
the
description
of
last
judgment
or
whether
in
paris
on
a
palm
sunday
we
see
maidens
at
the
pictures
presented
stand
out
with
the
clearness
and
finality
of
the
typical
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
rilke
dedicated
this
book
to
gerhart
hauptmann
in
love
and
gratitude
for
his
michael
kramer
hauptmann
like
rilke
in
these
poems
has
placed
before
us
great
epic
figures
and
his
art
is
so
concentrated
that
often
the
simple
expression
of
the
thought
of
one
of
his
characters
produces
a
shudder
in
the
listener
or
reader
because
in
this
thought
there
vibrates
the
suffering
of
an
entire
social
class
and
in
it
resounds
the
sorrow
of
many
generations
in
book
of
rilke
art
reaches
its
culmination
on
what
might
be
termed
its
monumental
side
the
visualization
is
elevated
to
the
impersonal
objective
level
which
gives
to
the
rhythm
of
these
poems
an
imperturbable
calm
to
the
figures
presented
a
monumental
erectness
men
of
the
house
of
xii
riding
through
the
are
portrayed
each
with
his
individual
historical
gesture
with
a
luminosity
as
strong
as
the
colour
and
movement
which
they
gave
to
their
time
in
the
mythical
poem
in
this
concrete
element
in
the
art
of
rilke
has
found
perhaps
its
supreme
expression
kings
in
old
legends
seem
like
mountains
rising
in
the
evening
light
they
blind
all
with
their
gleam
their
loins
encircled
are
by
girdles
bright
their
robes
are
edged
with
bands
of
precious
stones
the
rarest
earth
affords
with
richly
jeweled
hands
they
hold
their
slender
shining
naked
swords
there
are
in
book
of
poems
in
which
this
will
to
concentrate
a
mood
into
its
essence
and
finality
is
applied
to
purely
lyrical
poems
as
in
that
stands
out
in
this
volume
like
the
great
dark
tree
itself
so
immeasurable
is
the
straight
line
of
its
aspiration
reaching
into
the
far
distant
silence
of
the
night
or
as
in
the
poem
entitled
with
its
melancholy
mood
of
gentle
descent
in
all
nature
in
book
of
rilke
withdraws
from
the
world
not
from
weariness
but
weighed
down
under
the
manifold
conflicting
visions
as
the
prophet
who
would
bring
to
the
world
a
great
possession
must
go
forth
into
the
desert
to
be
alone
until
the
kingdom
comes
to
him
from
within
so
the
poet
must
leave
the
world
in
order
to
gain
the
deeper
understanding
to
be
face
to
face
with
god
the
mood
of
is
this
mood
of
being
face
to
face
with
god
it
elevates
these
poems
to
prayer
profound
prayer
of
doubt
and
despair
exalted
prayer
of
reconciliation
and
triumph
book
of
contains
three
parts
written
at
different
periods
in
the
poet
life
book
of
a
monk
book
of
and
book
of
poverty
and
although
the
entire
volume
was
not
published
until
several
years
later
book
of
glows
with
a
mystic
fervour
to
know
god
to
be
near
him
in
this
desire
to
approach
the
nameless
one
the
young
brother
in
book
of
a
monk
builds
up
about
god
parables
images
and
legends
reminiscent
of
those
of
the
century
angelus
silesius
but
sustained
by
a
more
pregnant
language
because
exalted
by
a
more
ardent
visionary
force
the
motif
of
monk
is
expressed
in
the
poem
beginning
with
the
lines
i
live
my
life
in
circles
that
grow
wide
and
endlessly
unroll
through
the
grey
cell
of
the
young
monk
there
flash
in
luminous
magnificence
the
colours
of
the
great
renaissance
masters
for
he
feels
in
titian
in
michelangelo
in
raphael
the
same
fervour
that
animates
him
they
too
are
worshippers
of
the
same
god
there
are
poems
in
book
of
of
the
stillness
of
a
whispered
prayer
in
a
great
cathedral
and
there
are
others
that
carry
in
their
exultation
the
music
of
mighty
hymns
the
visions
in
this
second
book
are
no
less
ecstatic
though
less
glowingly
colourful
they
have
withdrawn
inward
and
have
brought
a
great
peace
and
a
great
faith
as
in
the
poem
of
god
whose
very
manifestation
is
the
quietude
and
hush
of
a
silent
world
by
day
thou
art
the
legend
and
the
dream
that
like
a
whisper
floats
about
all
men
the
deep
and
brooding
stillnesses
which
seem
after
the
hour
has
struck
to
close
again
and
when
the
day
with
drowsy
gesture
bends
and
sinks
to
sleep
beneath
the
evening
skies
as
from
each
roof
a
tower
of
smoke
ascends
so
does
thy
realm
my
god
around
me
rise
the
last
part
of
book
of
book
of
poverty
and
is
finally
a
symphony
of
variations
on
the
two
great
symbolic
themes
in
the
work
of
rilke
as
christ
in
the
parable
of
the
rich
young
man
demands
the
abandonment
of
all
treasures
so
in
this
book
the
poet
sees
the
coming
of
the
kingdom
the
fulfilment
of
all
our
longings
for
a
nearness
to
god
when
we
have
become
simple
again
like
little
children
and
poor
in
possessions
like
god
himself
in
this
phase
of
development
the
principle
of
renunciation
constitutes
a
certain
negative
element
in
his
philosophy
the
poet
later
proceeded
to
a
positive
acquiescence
toward
man
possessions
at
least
those
acquired
or
created
in
the
domain
of
art
in
our
approach
through
the
mystic
we
touch
reality
most
deeply
it
is
because
of
this
that
all
art
and
all
philosophy
culminate
in
their
final
forms
in
a
crystallization
of
those
values
of
life
that
remain
forever
inexplicable
to
pure
reason
they
become
religious
in
the
simple
profound
sense
of
that
word
before
the
eternal
facts
of
life
doubt
and
strife
are
reconciled
into
faith
will
and
pride
change
into
humility
the
realization
of
this
truth
expressed
in
the
medium
of
poetry
is
the
significance
of
rilke
of
a
distinguished
scandinavian
writer
has
pronounced
one
of
the
supreme
literary
achievements
of
our
time
and
its
deepest
and
most
beautiful
book
of
prayer
in
his
subsequent
poetic
work
rilke
did
not
again
reach
the
sustained
high
quality
of
this
book
the
mood
and
idea
of
which
he
incorporated

work

exquisite
lyrical
beauty

which

in

caught
with
the

intense

vision
as

flamingos
and

spreading
their
soft
plumage
in
the
warmth
of
the
sun
in
the
avenue
of
the
jardin
des
plantes
almost
all
of
the
poems
in
these
two
volumes
are
short
and
precise
the
images
are
portrayed
with
the
sensitive
intensity
of
impressionistic
technique
the
majestic
quietude
of
the
long
lines
of
book
of
is
broken
the
colours
are
more
vibrant
more
scintillating
and
the
pictures
are
painted
in
nervous
darting
strokes
as
though
to
convey
the
manner
in
which
they
were
perceived
in
one
single
glance
for
this
reason
many
of
these
are
not
quite
free
from
a
certain
element
of
virtuosity
on
the
other
hand
rilke
achieves
at
times
a
perfect
surety
of
rapid
stroke
as
in
the
poem
spanish
who
rises
luminously
on
the
horizon
of
our
inner
vision
like
a
circling
element
of
fire
flaming
and
blinding
in
the
momentum
of
her
movements
degas
and
zuloaga
seem
to
have
combined
their
art
on
one
canvas
to
give
to
this
dancer
the
abundant
elasticity
of
grace
and
the
splendid
fantasy
of
colour
many
of
the
themes
in
the
bear
testimony
to
the
fact
that
rilke
travelled
extensively
prior
to
the
writing
of
these
volumes
in
italy
germany
france
and
scandinavia
his
book
on
the
five
painters
at
the
artists
colony
at
worpswede
where
he
remained
for
a
time
entirely
given
over
to
the
observation
of
the
atmosphere
the
movement
of
the
sky
and
the
play
of
light
upon
the
far
heath
of
this
northern
landscape
is
an
introduction
to
every
interpretation
of
the
work
of
landscape
painters
and
a
tender
poem
to
a
land
whose
solitary
and
melancholy
beauty
entered
into
his
own
work
more
vital
than
the
influence
of
the
personalities
and
the
art
treasures
of
the
countries
which
rilke
visited
and
more
potent
in
its
effect
upon
his
creations
like
a
great
sun
over
the
most
fruitful
years
of
his
life
stands
the
towering
personality
of
auguste
rodin
the
bear
the
dedication
a
mon
grand
ami
auguste
rodin
indicating
the
twofold
influence
which
the
french
sculptor
wielded
over
the
poet
that
of
a
friend
and
that
of
an
artist
one
recalls
the
broad
figure
of
rodin
with
his
rugged
features
and
high
finely
chiselled
forehead
moving
slowly
among
the
white
glistening
marble
busts
and
statues
as
a
giant
in
an
old
legend
moves
among
the
rocks
and
mountains
of
his
realm
patient
the
man
who
has
mastered
life
strong
and
tempered
by
the
storms
of
time
and
one
thinks
of
rainer
maria
rilke
young
blond
with
his
slender
aristocratic
figure
the
slightly
figure
of
one
who
on
solitary
walks
meditates
much
and
intensely
with
his
sensitive
full
mouth
and
the
firm
structure
of
the
eyebrow
gladly
sunk
in
the
shadow
of
contemplation
the
face
full
of
dreams
and
with
an
expression
of
listening
to
some
distant
music
from
no
other
book
of
his
not
excepting
book
of
can
we
deduce
so
accurate
a
conception
of
rilke
philosophy
of
life
and
art
as
we
can
draw
from
his
comparatively
short
monograph
on
auguste
rodin
rilke
sees
in
rodin
the
dominant
personification
in
our
age
of
the
power
of
servitude
in
all
nature
for
this
reason
the
book
on
rodin
is
far
more
than
a
purely
æsthetic
valuation
of
the
sculptor
work
rilke
traces
throughout
the
book
the
strongly
ethical
principle
which
works
itself
out
in
every
creative
act
in
the
realm
of
art
this
grasp
of
the
deeper
significance
of
all
art
gives
to
the
book
on
rodin
its
religious
aspect
of
thought
and
its
hymnlike
rhythm
of
expression
he
begins
rodin
was
solitary
before
fame
came
to
him
and
afterward
he
became
perhaps
still
more
solitary
for
fame
is
ultimately
but
the
summary
of
all
misunderstandings
that
crystallize
about
a
new
name
and
he
sums
up
this
one
man
greatness
sometime
it
will
be
realized
what
has
made
this
great
artist
so
supreme
he
was
a
worker
whose
only
desire
was
to
penetrate
with
all
his
forces
into
the
humble
and
the
difficult
significance
of
his
tool
therein
lay
a
certain
renunciation
of
life
but
in
just
this
renunciation
lay
his
triumph
for
life
entered
into
his
work
rodin
became
to
rilke
the
manifestation
of
the
divine
principle
of
the
creative
impulse
in
man
thus
rilke
monograph
on
auguste
rodin
will
remain
the
poet
testament
on
life
and
art
rilke
has
lived
deeply
he
has
absorbed
into
his
artistic
and
spiritual
consciousness
many
of
the
supreme
values
of
our
time
his
art
holds
the
mystic
depth
of
the
slav
the
musical
strength
of
the
german
and
the
visual
clarity
of
the
latin
as
artist
he
has
felt
life
to
be
sacred
and
as
a
priest
he
has
brought
to
its
altar
many
offerings

in
the
vale
and
friend
and
foe
and
the
feast
in
the
hall
and
may
and
the
maid
and
the
glen
and
the
grail
god
flags
afloat
on
every
wall
in
a
thousand
streets
unfurled
beneath
the
armour
of
the
knight
behind
the
chain
black
links
death
crouches
and
thinks
and
thinks
when
will
the
sword
blade
sharp
and
bright
forth
from
the
scabbard
spring
and
cut
the
network
of
the
cloak
enmeshing
me
ring
on
ring
when
will
the
foe
delivering
stroke
set
me
free
to
dance
and
sing
the
boy
i
wish
i
might
become
like
one
of
these
who
in
the
night
on
horses
wild
astride
with
torches
flaming
out
like
loosened
hair
on
to
the
chase
through
the
great
swift
wind
ride
i
wish
to
stand
as
on
a
boat
and
dare
the
sweeping
storm
mighty
like
flag
unrolled
in
darkness
but
with
helmet
made
of
gold
that
shimmers
restlessly
and
in
a
row
behind
me
in
the
dark
ten
men
that
glow
with
helmets
that
are
restless
too
like
mine
now
old
and
dull
now
clear
as
glass
they
shine
one
stands
by
me
and
blows
a
blast
apace
on
his
great
flashing
trumpet
and
the
sound
shrieks
through
the
vast
black
solitude
around
through
which
as
through
a
wild
mad
dream
we
race
the
houses
fall
behind
us
on
their
knees
before
us
bend
the
streets
and
them
we
gain
the
great
squares
yieled
to
us
and
them
we
seize
and
on
our
steeds
rush
like
the
roar
of
rain
initiation
whosoever
thou
art
out
in
the
evening
roam
out
from
thy
room
thou
in
every
part
and
far
in
the
dim
distance
leave
thy
home
whosoever
thou
art
lift
thine
eyes
which
lingering
see
the
shadows
on
the
threshold
fall
lift
thine
eyes
slowly
to
the
great
dark
tree
that
stands
against
heaven
solitary
tall
and
thou
hast
visioned
life
its
meanings
rise
like
words
that
in
the
silence
clearer
grow
as
they
unfold
before
thy
will
to
know
gently
withdraw
thine
eyes
the
neighbour
strange
violin
dost
thou
follow
me
in
many
foreign
cities
far
away
thy
lone
voice
spoke
to
me
like
memory
do
hundreds
play
thee
or
does
but
one
play
are
there
in
all
great
cities
men
who
would
seek
the
rivers
but
for
thee
who
but
for
thee
would
be
forever
lost
why
drifts
thy
lonely
voice
always
to
me
why
am
i
the
neighbour
always
of
those
who
force
to
sing
thy
trembling
strings
life
is
more
heavy
thy
song
says
than
the
vast
heavy
burden
of
all
things
song
of
the
statue
who
so
loveth
me
that
he
will
give
his
precious
life
for
me
i
shall
be
set
free
from
the
stone
if
some
one
drowns
for
me
in
the
sea
i
shall
have
life
life
of
my
own
for
life
i
ache
i
long
for
the
singing
blood
the
stone
is
so
still
and
cold
i
dream
of
life
life
is
good
will
no
one
love
me
and
be
bold
and
me
awake
i
weep
and
weep
alone
weep
always
for
my
stone
what
joy
is
my
blood
to
me
if
it
ripens
like
red
wine
it
can
not
call
back
from
the
sea
the
life
that
was
given
for
mine
given
for
love
sake
maidens
i
others
must
by
a
long
dark
way
stray
to
the
mystic
bards
or
ask
some
one
who
has
heard
them
sing
or
touch
the
magic
chords
only
the
maidens
question
not
the
bridges
that
lead
to
dream
their
luminous
smiles
are
like
strands
of
pearls
on
a
silver
vase
agleam
the
maidens
doors
of
life
lead
out
where
the
song
of
the
poet
soars
and
out
beyond
to
the
great
world
to
the
world
beyond
the
doors
maidens
ii
maidens
the
poets
learn
from
you
to
tell
how
solitary
and
remote
you
are
as
night
is
lighted
by
one
high
bright
star
they
draw
light
from
the
distance
where
you
dwell
for
poet
you
must
always
maiden
be
even
though
his
eyes
the
woman
in
you
wake
wedding
brocade
your
fragile
wrists
would
break
mysterious
elusive
from
him
flee
within
his
garden
let
him
wait
alone
where
benches
stand
expectant
in
the
shade
within
the
chamber
where
the
lyre
was
played
where
he
received
you
as
the
eternal
one
go
it
grows
dark
your
voice
and
form
no
more
his
senses
seek
he
now
no
longer
sees
a
white
robe
fluttering
under
dark
beech
trees
along
the
pathway
where
it
gleamed
before
he
loves
the
long
paths
where
no
footfalls
ring
and
he
loves
much
the
silent
chamber
where
like
a
soft
whisper
through
the
quiet
air
he
hears
your
voice
far
distant
vanishing
the
softly
stealing
echo
comes
again
from
crowds
of
men
whom
wearily
he
shuns
and
many
see
you
there
so
his
thought
runs
and
tenderest
memories
are
pierced
with
pain
the
bride
call
me
beloved
call
aloud
to
me
thy
bride
her
vigil
at
the
window
keeps
the
evening
wanes
to
dusk
the
dimness
creeps
down
empty
alleys
of
the
old
o
let
thy
voice
enfold
me
close
about
or
from
this
dark
house
lonely
and
remote
through
deep
blue
gardens
where
gray
shadows
float
i
will
pour
forth
my
soul
with
hands
stretched
out
autumnal
day
lord
it
is
time
so
great
was
summer
glow
thy
shadows
lay
upon
the
dials
faces
and
wide
spaces
let
thy
tempests
blow
command
to
ripen
the
last
fruits
of
thine
give
to
them
two
more
burning
days
and
press
the
last
sweetness
into
the
heavy
wine
he
who
has
now
no
house
will
build
one
who
is
alone
will
now
remain
alone
he
will
awake
will
read
will
letters
write
through
the
long
day
and
in
the
lonely
night
and
restless
solitary
he
will
rove
where
the
leaves
rustle
in
the
grove
moonlight
night
night
the
ripe
moon
hangs
above
weaving
enchantment
the
shadowy
lea
from
the
old
tower
the
hours
fall
heavily
into
the
dark
as
though
into
the
sea
a
rustle
a
call
of
in
the
grove
then
for
a
while
void
silence
fills
the
air
and
then
a
violin
from
god
knows
where
awakes
and
slowly
sings
oh
love
oh
love
in
april
again
the
woods
are
odorous
the
lark
lifts
on
upsoaring
wings
the
heaven
gray
that
hung
above
the
veiled
and
dark
where
branches
bare
disclosed
the
empty
day
after
long
rainy
afternoons
an
hour
comes
with
its
shafts
of
golden
light
and
flings
them
at
the
windows
in
a
radiant
shower
and
rain
drops
beat
the
panes
like
timorous
wings
then
all
is
still
the
stones
are
crooned
to
sleep
by
the
soft
sound
of
rain
that
slowly
dies
and
cradled
in
the
branches
hidden
deep
in
each
bright
bud
a
slumbering
silence
lies
memories
of
a
childhood
the
darkness
hung
like
richness
in
the
room
when
like
a
dream
the
mother
entered
there
and
then
a
glass
tinkle
stirred
the
air
near
where
a
boy
sat
in
the
silent
gloom
the
room
betrayed
the
mother
so
she
felt
she
kissed
her
boy
and
questioned
are
you
here
and
with
a
gesture
that
he
held
most
dear
down
for
a
moment
by
his
side
she
knelt
toward
the
piano
they
both
shyly
glanced
for
she
would
sing
to
him
on
many
a
night
and
the
child
seated
in
the
fading
light
would
listen
strangely
as
if
half
entranced
his
large
eyes
fastened
with
a
quiet
glow
upon
the
hand
which
by
her
ring
seemed
bent
and
slowly
wandering
the
white
keys
went
moving
as
though
against
a
drift
of
snow
death
before
us
great
death
stands
our
fate
held
close
within
his
quiet
hands
when
with
proud
joy
we
lift
life
red
wine
to
drink
deep
of
the
mystic
shining
cup
and
ecstasy
through
all
our
being
leaps
death
bows
his
head
and
weeps
the
ashantee
jardin
paris
no
vision
of
exotic
southern
countries
no
dancing
women
supple
brown
and
tall
whirling
from
out
their
falling
draperies
to
melodies
that
beat
a
fierce
mad
call
no
sound
of
songs
that
from
the
hot
blood
rise
no
langorous
stretching
dusky
velvet
maids
flashing
like
gleaming
weapon
their
bright
eyes
no
swift
wild
thrill
the
quickening
blood
pervades
only
mouths
widening
with
a
still
broad
smile
of
comprehension
a
strange
knowing
leer
at
white
men
at
their
vanity
and
guile
an
understanding
that
fills
one
with
fear
the
beasts
in
cages
much
more
loyal
are
restlessly
pacing
pacing
to
and
fro
dreaming
of
countries
beckoning
from
afar
lands
where
they
roamed
in
days
of
long
ago
they
burn
with
an
unquenched
and
smothered
fire
consumed
by
longings
over
which
they
brood
oblivious
of
time
without
desire
alone
and
lost
in
their
great
solitude
remembrance
expectant
and
waiting
you
muse
on
the
great
rare
thing
which
alone
to
enhance
your
life
you
would
choose
the
awakening
of
the
stone
the
deeps
where
yourself
you
would
lose
in
the
dusk
of
the
shelves
embossed
shine
the
volumes
in
gold
and
browns
and
you
think
of
countries
once
crossed
of
pictures
of
shimmering
gowns
of
the
women
that
you
have
lost
and
it
comes
to
you
then
at
last
and
you
rise
for
you
are
aware
of
a
year
in
the
far
off
past
with
its
wonder
and
fear
and
prayer
music
what
play
you
o
boy
through
the
garden
it
stole
like
wandering
steps
like
a
whisper
then
mute
what
play
you
o
boy
lo
your
gypsying
soul
is
caught
and
held
fast
in
the
pipes
of
pan
flute
and
what
conjure
you
imprisoned
is
the
song
it
lingers
and
longs
in
the
reeds
where
it
lies
your
young
life
is
strong
but
how
much
more
strong
is
the
longing
that
through
your
music
sighs
let
your
flute
be
still
and
your
soul
float
through
waves
of
sound
formless
as
waves
of
the
sea
for
here
your
song
lived
and
it
wisely
grew
before
it
was
forced
into
melody
its
wings
beat
gently
its
note
no
more
calls
its
flight
has
been
spent
by
you
dreaming
boy
now
it
no
longer
steals
over
my
walls
but
in
my
garden
i
woo
it
to
joy
maiden
melancholy
a
young
knight
comes
into
my
mind
as
from
some
myth
of
old
he
came
you
felt
yourself
entwined
as
a
great
storm
would
round
you
wind
he
went
a
blessing
undefined
seemed
left
as
when
declined
and
left
you
wrapt
in
prayer
you
fain
would
cry
aloud
but
bind
your
scarf
about
you
and
weep
softly
in
its
fold
a
young
knight
comes
into
my
mind
full
armored
forth
to
fare
his
smile
was
luminously
kind
like
glint
of
ivory
enshrined
like
a
home
longing
undivined
like
christmas
snows
where
dark
ways
wind
like
about
turquoise
twined
like
moonlight
silver
when
combined
with
a
loved
book
rare
gold
maidens
at
confirmation
paris
in
may
the
white
veiled
maids
to
confirmation
go
through
deep
green
garden
paths
they
slowly
wind
their
childhood
they
are
leaving
now
behind
the
future
will
be
different
they
know
oh
will
it
come
they
wait
it
must
come
soon
the
next
long
hour
slowly
strikes
at
last
the
whole
house
stirs
again
the
feast
is
past
and
sadly
passes
by
the
afternoon
like
resurrection
were
the
garments
white
the
wreathed
procession
walked
through
trees
arched
wide
into
the
church
as
cool
as
silk
inside
with
long
aisles
of
tall
candles
flaming
bright
the
lights
all
shone
like
jewels
rich
and
rare
to
solemn
eyes
that
watched
them
gleam
and
flare
then
through
the
silence
the
great
song
rose
high
up
to
the
vaulted
dome
like
clouds
it
soared
then
luminously
gently
down
it
poured
over
white
veils
like
rain
it
seemed
to
die
the
wind
through
the
white
garments
softly
stirred
and
they
grew
in
each
fold
and
each
fold
hidden
blossoms
seemed
to
hold
and
flowers
and
stars
and
fluting
notes
of
bird
and
dim
quaint
figures
shimmering
like
gold
seemed
to
come
forth
from
distant
myths
of
old
outside
the
day
was
one
of
green
and
blue
with
touches
of
a
luminous
glowing
red
across
the
quiet
pond
the
small
waves
sped
beyond
the
city
gardens
hidden
from
view
sent
odors
of
sweet
blossoms
on
the
breeze
and
singing
sounded
through
the
far
off
trees
it
was
as
though
garlands
crowned
everything
and
all
things
were
touched
softly
by
the
sun
and
many
windows
opened
one
by
one
and
the
light
trembled
on
them
glistening
the
woman
who
loves
ah
yes
i
long
for
you
to
you
i
glide
and
lose
myself
for
to
you
i
belong
the
hope
that
hitherto
i
have
denied
imperious
comes
to
me
as
from
your
side
serious
unfaltering
and
swift
and
strong
those
times
the
times
when
i
was
quite
alone
by
memories
wrapt
that
whispered
to
me
low
my
silence
was
the
quiet
of
a
stone
over
which
rippling
murmuring
waters
flow
but
in
these
weeks
of
the
awakening
spring
something
within
me
has
been
freed
something
that
in
the
past
dark
years
unconscious
lay
which
rises
now
within
me
and
commands
and
gives
my
poor
warm
life
into
your
hands
who
know
not
what
i
was
that
yesterday
pont
du
carrousel
upon
the
bridge
the
blind
man
stands
alone
gray
like
a
mist
veiled
monument
he
towers
as
though
of
nameless
realms
the
boundary
stone
about
which
circle
distant
starry
hours
he
seems
the
center
around
which
stars
glow
while
all
earth
ostentations
surge
below
immovably
and
silently
he
stands
placed
where
the
confused
current
ebbs
and
flows
past
fathomless
dark
depths
that
he
commands
a
shallow
generation
drifting
goes
madness
she
thinks
i
am
have
you
not
seen
who
are
you
then
marie
i
am
a
queen
i
am
a
queen
to
your
knee
to
your
knee
and
then
she
weeps
i
was
a
child
who
were
you
then
marie
know
you
that
i
was
no
man
child
poor
and
in
rags
said
she
and
then
a
princess
i
became
to
whom
men
bend
their
knees
to
princes
things
are
not
the
same
as
those
a
beggar
sees
and
those
things
which
have
made
you
great
came
to
you
tell
me
when
one
night
one
night
one
night
quite
late
things
became
different
then
i
walked
the
lane
which
presently
with
strung
chords
seemed
to
bend
then
marie
became
melody
and
danced
from
end
to
end
the
people
watched
with
startled
mien
and
passed
with
frightened
glance
for
all
know
that
only
a
queen
may
dance
in
the
lanes
dance
lament
oh
all
things
are
long
passed
away
and
far
a
light
is
shining
but
the
distant
star
from
which
it
still
comes
to
me
has
been
dead
a
thousand
years
in
the
dim
phantom
boat
that
glided
past
some
ghastly
thing
was
said
a
clock
just
struck
within
some
house
remote
which
house
i
long
to
still
my
beating
heart
beneath
the
sky
vast
dome
i
long
to
pray
of
all
the
stars
there
must
be
far
away
a
single
star
which
still
exists
apart
and
i
believe
that
i
should
know
the
one
which
has
alone
endured
and
which
alone
like
a
white
city
that
all
space
commands
at
the
ray
end
in
the
high
heaven
stands
symbols
from
infinite
longings
finite
deeds
rise
as
fountains
spring
toward
glowing
skies
but
rushing
swiftly
upward
weakly
bend
and
trembling
from
their
lack
of
power
descend
so
through
the
falling
torrent
of
our
fears
our
joyous
force
leaps
like
these
dancing
tears
new
poems
early
apollo
as
when
at
times
there
breaks
through
branches
bare
a
morning
vibrant
with
the
breath
of
spring
about
this
a
splendour
rare
transforms
it
almost
to
a
mortal
thing
there
is
as
yet
no
shadow
in
his
glance
too
cool
his
temples
for
the
laurel
glow
but
later
those
marble
brows
perchance
a
with
bushes
tall
will
grow
and
single
petals
one
by
one
will
fall
the
still
mouth
and
break
its
silent
thrall
the
mouth
that
trembles
with
a
dawning
smile
as
though
a
song
were
rising
there
the
while
the
tomb
of
a
young
girl
we
still
remember
the
same
as
of
yore
all
that
has
happened
once
again
must
be
as
grows
a
upon
the
shore
it
was
like
that
your
light
small
breasts
you
bore
and
his
blood
current
coursed
like
the
wild
sea
that
god
who
was
the
wanderer
the
slim
despoiler
of
fair
women
he
the
wise
but
sweet
and
glowing
as
your
thoughts
of
him
who
cast
a
shadow
over
your
young
limb
while
bending
like
your
arched
brows
your
eyes
the
poet
you
hour
from
me
you
ever
take
your
flight
your
swift
wings
wound
me
as
they
whir
along
without
you
void
would
be
my
day
and
night
without
you
i
not
capture
my
great
song
i
have
no
earthly
spot
where
i
can
live
i
have
no
love
i
have
no
household
fane
and
all
the
things
to
which
myself
i
give
impoverish
me
with
richness
they
attain
the
panther
his
weary
glance
from
passing
by
the
bars
has
grown
into
a
dazed
and
vacant
stare
it
seems
to
him
there
are
a
thousand
bars
and
out
beyond
those
bars
the
empty
air
the
pad
of
his
strong
feet
that
ceaseless
sound
of
supple
tread
behind
the
iron
bands
is
like
a
dance
of
strength
circling
around
while
in
the
circle
stunned
a
great
will
stands
but
there
are
times
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
dilate
the
strong
limbs
stand
alert
apart
tense
with
the
flood
of
visions
that
arise
only
to
sink
and
die
within
his
heart
growing
blind
among
all
the
others
there
sat
a
guest
who
sipped
her
tea
as
if
one
apart
and
she
held
her
cup
not
quite
like
the
rest
once
she
smiled
so
it
pierced
one
heart
when
the
group
of
people
arose
at
last
and
laughed
and
talked
in
a
merry
tone
as
lingeringly
through
the
rooms
they
passed
i
saw
that
she
followed
alone
tense
and
still
like
one
who
to
sing
must
rise
before
a
throng
on
a
festal
night
she
lifted
her
head
and
her
bright
glad
eyes
were
like
pools
which
reflected
light
she
followed
on
slowly
after
the
last
as
though
some
object
must
be
passed
by
and
yet
as
if
were
it
once
but
passed
she
would
no
longer
walk
but
fly
the
spanish
dancer
as
a
lit
match
first
flickers
in
the
hands
before
it
flames
and
darts
out
from
all
sides
bright
twitching
tongues
so
ringed
by
growing
bands
of
spectators
she
quivering
glowing
stands
poised
tensely
for
the
dance
then
forward
glides
and
suddenly
becomes
a
flaming
torch
her
bright
hair
flames
her
burning
glances
scorch
and
with
a
daring
art
at
her
command
her
whole
robe
blazes
like
a
from
which
is
stretched
each
naked
arm
awake
gleaming
and
rattling
like
a
frightened
snake
and
then
as
though
the
fire
fainter
grows
she
gathers
up
the
flame
again
it
glows
as
with
proud
gesture
and
imperious
air
she
flings
it
to
the
earth
and
it
lies
there
furiously
flickering
and
crackling
still
then
haughtily
victorious
but
with
sweet
swift
smile
of
greeting
she
puts
forth
her
will
and
stamps
the
flames
out
with
her
small
firm
feet
offering
my
body
glows
in
every
vein
and
blooms
to
fullest
flower
since
i
first
knew
thee
my
walk
unconscious
pride
and
power
assumes
who
art
thou
then
thou
who
awaitest
me
when
from
the
past
i
draw
myself
the
while
i
lose
old
traits
as
leaves
of
autumn
fall
i
only
know
the
radiance
of
thy
smile
like
the
soft
gleam
of
stars
transforming
all
through
childhood
years
i
wandered
unaware
of
shimmering
visions
my
thoughts
now
arrests
to
offer
thee
as
on
an
altar
fair
that
lighted
by
the
bright
flame
of
thy
hair
and
wreathéd
by
the
blossoms
of
thy
breasts
love
song
when
my
soul
touches
yours
a
great
chord
sings
how
shall
i
tune
it
then
to
other
things
o
that
some
spot
in
darkness
could
be
found
that
does
not
vibrate
your
depths
sound
but
everything
that
touches
you
and
me
welds
us
as
played
strings
sound
one
melody
where
is
the
instrument
whence
the
sounds
flow
and
whose
the
that
holds
the
bow
o
sweet
song
archaic
torso
of
apollo
we
can
not
fathom
his
mysterious
head
through
the
veiled
eyes
no
flickering
ray
is
sent
but
from
his
torso
gleaming
light
is
shed
as
from
a
candelabrum
inward
bent
his
glance
there
glows
and
lingers
otherwise
the
round
breast
would
not
blind
you
with
its
grace
nor
could
the
circle
of
the
thighs
steal
to
the
arc
whence
issues
a
new
race
nor
could
this
stark
and
stunted
stone
display
vibrance
beneath
the
shoulders
heavy
bar
nor
shine
like
fur
upon
a
beast
of
prey
nor
break
forth
from
its
lines
like
a
great
star
there
is
no
spot
that
does
not
bind
you
fast
and
transport
you
back
back
to
a
far
past
the
book
of
hours
book
of
a
monk
i
live
my
life
in
circles
that
grow
wide
and
endlessly
unroll
i
may
not
reach
the
last
but
on
i
glide
strong
pinioned
toward
my
goal
about
the
old
tower
dark
against
the
sky
the
beat
of
my
wings
hums
i
circle
about
god
sweep
far
and
high
on
through
milleniums
am
i
a
bird
that
skims
the
clouds
along
or
am
i
a
wild
storm
or
a
great
song
many
have
painted
her
but
there
was
one
who
drew
his
radiant
colours
from
the
sun
mysteriously
glowing
through
a
background
dim
when
he
was
suffering
she
came
to
him
and
all
the
heavy
pain
within
his
heart
rose
in
his
hands
and
stole
into
his
art
his
canvas
is
the
beautiful
bright
veil
through
which
her
sorrow
shines
there
where
the
texture
her
sad
lips
is
closely
drawn
a
trembling
smile
softly
begins
to
dawn
though
angels
with
seven
candles
light
the
place
you
can
not
read
the
secret
of
her
face
in
cassocks
clad
i
have
had
many
brothers
in
southern
cloisters
where
the
laurel
grows
they
paint
madonnas
like
fair
human
mothers
and
i
dream
of
young
titians
and
of
others
in
which
the
god
with
shining
radiance
glows
but
though
my
vigil
constantly
i
keep
my
god
is
dark
like
woven
texture
flowing
a
hundred
drinking
roots
all
intertwined
i
only
know
that
from
his
warmth
i
growing
more
i
know
not
my
roots
lie
hidden
deep
my
branches
only
are
swayed
by
the
wind
thou
anxious
one
and
dost
thou
then
not
hear
against
thee
all
my
surging
senses
sing
about
thy
face
in
circles
drawing
near
my
thought
floats
like
a
fluttering
white
wing
dost
thou
not
see
before
thee
stands
my
soul
in
silence
wrapt
my
springtime
prayer
to
pray
but
when
thy
glance
rests
on
me
then
my
whole
being
quickens
and
blooms
like
trees
in
may
when
thou
art
dreaming
then
i
am
thy
dream
but
when
thou
art
awake
i
am
thy
will
potent
with
splendour
radiant
and
sublime
expanding
like
far
space
and
still
into
the
distant
mystic
realm
of
time
i
love
my
life
dark
hours
in
which
my
senses
quicken
and
grow
deep
while
as
from
faint
incense
of
faded
flowers
or
letters
old
i
magically
steep
myself
in
days
gone
by
again
i
give
myself
unto
the
past
again
i
live
out
of
my
dark
hours
wisdom
dawns
apace
infinite
life
unrolls
its
boundless
space
then
i
am
shaken
as
a
sweeping
storm
shakes
a
ripe
tree
that
grows
above
a
grave
whose
cold
clay
the
roots
twine
fast
and
warm
and
youth
fair
visions
that
glowed
bright
and
brave
dreams
that
were
closely
cherished
and
for
long
are
lost
once
more
in
sadness
and
in
song
book
of
by
day
thou
are
the
legend
and
the
dream
that
like
a
whisper
floats
about
all
men
the
deep
and
brooding
stillnesses
which
seem
after
the
hour
has
struck
to
close
again
and
when
the
day
with
drowsy
gesture
bends
and
sinks
to
sleep
beneath
the
evening
skies
as
from
each
roof
a
tower
of
smoke
ascends
so
does
thy
realm
my
god
around
me
rise
all
those
who
seek
thee
tempt
thee
and
those
who
find
would
bind
thee
to
gesture
and
to
form
but
i
would
comprehend
thee
as
the
wide
earth
unfolds
thee
thou
growest
with
my
maturity
thou
art
in
calm
and
storm
i
ask
of
thee
no
vanity
to
evidence
and
prove
thee
thou
wert
in
eons
old
perform
no
miracles
for
me
but
justify
thy
laws
to
me
which
as
the
years
pass
by
me
all
soundlessly
unfold
in
a
house
was
one
who
arose
from
the
feast
and
went
forth
to
wander
in
distant
lands
because
there
was
somewhere
far
off
in
the
east
a
spot
which
he
sought
where
a
great
church
stands
and
ever
his
children
when
breaking
their
bread
thought
of
him
and
rose
up
and
blessed
him
as
dead
in
another
house
was
the
one
who
had
died
who
still
sat
at
table
and
drank
from
the
glass
and
ever
within
the
walls
did
abide
for
out
of
the
house
he
could
no
more
pass
and
his
children
set
forth
to
seek
for
the
spot
where
stands
the
great
church
which
he
forgot
extinguish
my
eyes
i
still
can
see
you
close
my
ears
i
can
hear
your
footsteps
fall
and
without
feet
i
still
can
follow
you
and
without
voice
i
still
can
to
you
call
break
off
my
arms
and
i
can
embrace
you
enfold
you
with
my
heart
as
with
a
hand
hold
my
heart
my
brain
will
take
fire
of
you
as
flax
ignites
from
a
lit
and
flame
will
sweep
in
a
swift
rushing
flood
through
all
the
singing
currents
of
my
blood
in
the
deep
nights
i
dig
for
you
o
treasure
to
seek
you
over
the
wide
world
i
roam
for
all
abundance
is
but
meager
measure
of
your
bright
beauty
which
is
yet
to
come
over
the
road
to
you
the
leaves
are
blowing
few
follow
it
the
way
is
long
and
steep
you
dwell
in
solitude
oh
does
your
glowing
heart
in
some
far
off
valley
lie
asleep
my
bloody
hands
with
digging
bruised
i
lifted
spread
like
a
tree
i
stretch
them
in
the
air
to
find
you
before
day
to
night
has
drifted
i
reach
out
into
space
to
seek
you
there
then
as
though
with
a
swift
impatient
gesture
flashing
from
distant
stars
on
sweeping
wing
you
come
and
over
earth
a
magic
vesture
steals
gently
as
the
rain
falls
in
the
spring
book
of
poverty
and
her
mouth
is
like
the
mouth
of
a
fine
bust
that
can
not
utter
sound
nor
breathe
nor
kiss
but
that
had
once
from
life
received
all
this
which
shaped
its
subtle
curves
and
ever
must
from
fullness
of
past
knowledge
dwell
alone
a
thing
apart
a
parable
in
stone
alone
thou
wanderest
through
space
profound
one
with
the
hidden
face
thou
art
poverty
great
rose
the
eternal
metamorphose
of
gold
into
the
light
of
sun
thou
art
the
mystic
homeless
one
into
the
world
thou
never
came
too
mighty
thou
too
great
to
name
voice
of
the
storm
song
that
the
wild
wind
sings
thou
harp
that
shatters
those
who
play
thy
strings
a
watcher
of
thy
spaces
make
me
make
me
a
listener
at
thy
stone
give
to
me
vision
and
then
wake
me
upon
thy
oceans
all
alone
thy
rivers
courses
let
me
follow
where
they
leap
the
crags
in
their
flight
and
where
at
dusk
in
caverns
hollow
they
croon
to
music
of
the
night
send
me
far
into
thy
barren
land
where
the
snow
clouds
the
wild
wind
drives
where
monasteries
like
gray
shrouds
stand
august
symbols
of
unlived
lives
there
pilgrims
climb
slowly
one
by
one
and
behind
them
a
blind
man
goes
with
him
i
will
walk
till
day
is
done
up
the
pathway
that
no
one
knows
