to
three
friends
captain
charley
and

two
fishers
when
the
war
is
over
charley
we
go
fishing
once
again
you
be
a
new
man
charley
when
you
walk
with
fishermen
for
we
seek
a
leaping
river
i
know
far
among
the
fells
you
forget
the
war
there
charley
where
the
springing
water
wells
it
god
own
land
for
the
nimble
trout
and
ferns
and
waving
flowers
the
bracken
and
the
bilberry
and
the
ash
the
coral
dowers
there
are
rolling
leagues
of
heather
lone
hills
where
the
plovers
call
oh
we
climb
those
hills
together
ere
the
last
dews
fall
and
we
talk
to
the
wild
creatures
in
the
crannies
of
the
moors
oh
our
hearts
will
mount
to
heaven
when
the
merry
lark
soars
all
our
days
will
shine
with
gladness
all
our
nights
with
calm
repose
and
we
throw
a
fly
together
where
the
rushing
stream
flows
nature
has
been
to
me
lately
as
a
fair
and
radiant
bride
she
has
drawn
me
with
strange
gentleness
to
the
hollow
of
her
side
she
has
gone
forth
like
a
warrior
with
pricking
glaive
and
spear
and
grief
has
quailed
in
his
ambush
when
her
flashing
arms
drew
near
i
never
loved
sweet
england
till
she
kissed
me
in
the
west
the
sun
upon
her
shining
brows
and
the
purple
on
her
breast
breathing
songs
of
low
compassion
to
my
spirit
as
it
cried
when
i
mourned
that
sinning
country
which
had
thrust
me
from
her
side
all
the
wooded
hills
of
the
eifel
all
the
of
the
rhine
all
the
glimmering
strands
of
the
baltic
all
the
brocken
black
with
pine
hold
no
tenderness
of
beauty
beauty
in
the
spirit
dwells
such
as
smiles
from
one
sweet
valley
darkling
the
western
fells
do
you
remember
old
fellow
when
we
fished
near
altenahr
where
the
red
wine
was
flowing
and
the
bowl
flashed
a
star
do
you
remember
the
big
schutzmann
with
his
sword
by
his
side
who
guessed
that
you
were
poaching
and
scared
you
off
to
hide
oh
if
he
only
known
charley
when
you
sought
the
bridge
cover
that
you
join
the
british
army
and
go
killing
of
his
brother
he
have
searched
bank
and
vineyard
for
a
poacher
of
such
worth
and
put
you
in
a
prison
cell
to
cool
your
summer
mirth
and
do
you
remember
the
old
inn
with
the
blue
saint
above
the
door
simon
peter
who
looked
longingly
upon
our
speckled
store
he
who
loves
all
careless
fishers
of
the
river
and
the
sea
and
prays
that
god
shall
save
them
with
his
mates
of
galilee
and
what
a
wild
night
we
had
when
we
rode
home
again
for
the
students
were
all
dancing
and
singing
in
the
train
and
a
tall
man
twanged
a
banjo
till
he
fairly
gave
us
fits
and
a
porter
ran
up
swearing
and
the
banjo
flew
to
bits
we
were
all
drunk
as
blazes
full
of
wine
to
burst
but
by
the
sober
lads
of
england
those
germans
were
the
worst
they
were
singing
and
dancing
and
shouting
with
delight
and
the
carriage
rocked
with
laughter
as
we
rushed
into
the
night
they
are
all
dead
now
charley
they
were
merry
fellows
then
they
are
dust
and
scattered
ashes
washed
by
the
rain
they
are
crying
in
the
darkness
where
a
grayer
planet
spins
but
the
lord
is
kind
to
fishers
and
has
spared
us
in
our
sins
oh
the
lord
is
kind
to
fishers
of
the
river
and
the
sea
for
the
sake
of
simon
peter
and
the
lads
of
galilee
for
the
sake
of
simon
peter
who
so
gladly
would
us
shrive
we
are
walking
in
the
sunlight
we
are
breathing
and
alive
and
when
the
war
is
over
we
fish
awhile
together
we
climb
the
western
mountains
and
walk
the
western
heather
and
the
curlew
and
the
wild
grouse
will
wake
the
vales
with
crying
and
their
soft
rushing
pinions
will
tremble
by
us
sighing
all
the
dead
shepherds
will
hear
them
in
their
rest
but
you
must
heed
dead
shepherds
when
you
fishing
in
the
west
you
must
heed
the
lonely
men
who
neither
sing
nor
dance
there
be
always
ghosts
there
charley
when
the
wind
beats
up
from
france
it
the
holy
peace
and
quiet
breathing
from
the
western
skies
which
bring
the
stricken
soul
its
rest
and
still
the
heart
wild
cries
if
i
had
turned
for
healing
where
the
moor
to
heaven
swells
i
have
been
a
dead
man
listening
to
the
mourning
of
the
bells
if
god
had
sent
me
healing
where
the
mountain
bares
her
breast
i
have
gone
wild
and
crazy
with
the
things
that
i
oppressed
all
my
mad
merry
comrades
of
drink
and
fight
and
lust
are
trodden
into
bloody
clay
and
blowing
with
the
dust
some
marched
away
with
hindenburg
and
some
with
general
kluck
one
under
austria
banners
with
the
devil
cards
for
luck
all
my
dreams
went
with
them
all
the
dreams
my
land
denied
but
they
smoke
and
drifting
wreckage
now
on
the
war
wild
tide
it
was
years
since
i
left
england
almost
singing
to
depart
she
had
cast
a
net
about
me
and
thrust
a
dagger
in
my
heart
but
another
country
smiled
to
me
and
made
me
quiet
nooks
where
men
crushed
for
me
the
grapes
of
joy
and
talked
to
me
of
books
she
was
a
kind
land
to
me
once
charley
i
had
real
joy
in
her
once
her
folk
loved
shakespeare
and
byron
shunned
no
dreamer
for
a
dunce
they
sang
old
folk
songs
noble
opera
read
old
quaint
sweets
and
there
were
no
starved
souls
in
her
temples
and
no
begging
men
in
her
streets
but
a
hand
ever
cut
my
heaven
with
the
sharpness
of
a
sword
there
was
the
very
riot
of
gladness
reckless
squander
of
joy
hoard
lechery
and
sad
corruption
danced
in
clinging
robes
of
light
beauty
smiled
in
the
arms
of
terror
and
diced
with
the
minions
of
night
and
you
sprang
to
england
banner
comrade
with
glad
praises
on
your
lips
to
the
song
of
her
sabres
ringing
and
the
thunder
of
her
ships
but
a
sword
broods
in
the
darkness
whose
sweep
is
the
wind
sway
and
the
dumb
white
ships
of
heaven
bear
dimly
earth
glory
away
the
still
white
ships
of
heaven
steal
out
beneath
the
stars
and
the
grieving
sorrowing
sailors
are
the
dead
men
of
the
wars
they
reck
not
of
the
chilly
seas
that
wildly
round
them
churn
and
the
dusk
scatters
before
the
prows
and
the
leaping
waters
burn
the
pirate
fleets
of
heaven
sweep
forth
into
the
night
laden
with
spoils
of
the
living
their
jewels
of
delight
their
topazes
and
rubies
the
bawds
that
gave
them
pleasure
and
the
sad
thieves
reef
the
swelling
sails
and
steal
from
earth
her
treasure
and
the
night
hangs
heavy
on
you
comrade
and
the
bitter
war
goes
on
you
are
parched
for
heaven
starlight
and
her
soft
refreshing
sun
joy
runs
with
a
passion
of
swiftness
on
the
gray
feet
of
the
wind
the
doors
of
darkness
tremble
then
swing
back
blind
but
you
be
a
new
man
one
day
where
the
west
wind
thrills
you
walk
with
your
olden
vigour
where
heaven
clasps
the
great
lone
hills
and
the
evening
sun
will
squander
soft
lustre
of
red
wine
and
we
drink
the
ripest
vintage
where
the
sun
and
stars
shine
for
the
lord
is
kind
to
fishers
of
the
river
and
the
sea
for
the
sake
of
simon
peter
and
the
lads
of
galilee
for
the
sake
of
simon
peter
who
so
lightly
would
us
shrive
we
will
drink
the
wine
of
heaven
and
give
praise
we
are
alive
all
our
days
will
shine
with
gladness
all
our
nights
with
rich
repose
laughter
will
breathe
from
our
spirits
like
the
sweet
scent
from
the
rose
and
joy
in
glittering
armour
will
go
forth
as
with
a
sword
when
we
climb
the
fells
together
to
the
glory
of
the
lord
sweet
sounds
will
rise
from
the
moorland
and
bird
and
bee
awake
beauty
will
break
and
blossom
for
each
stricken
soldier
sake
oh
your
heart
will
leap
with
joy
charley
and
your
spirit
know
rest
when
we
fish
a
little
river
i
heard
singing
in
the
west
the
saint
peter
inn
at
walporzheim
ahrdale
altenahr
above
the
crooked
roofs
the
clouds
go
sailing
and
near
the
stream
where
once
i
fished
for
grayling
the
crusty
oberkelner
stands
and
scolds
my
rod
still
hangs
upon
three
nails
just
where
i
placed
it
if
they
left
it
so
i
like
to
take
one
little
peep
and
know
and
every
time
the
landlord
looks
that
way
he
thinks
of
me
and
will
for
many
a
day
i
helped
to
break
up
germany
he
say
the
little
fishes
flick
their
tails
and
rise
they
fear
no
english
feathers
in
their
flies
and
i
am
back
in
yorkshire
growing
wise
the
soldiers
as
the
soldiers
march
along
all
the
air
is
filled
with
song
as
the
soldiers
charge
with
cheers
all
the
air
is
drenched
with
tears
and
when
they
take
their
ease
at
night
the
are
clothed
in
white
greifswald
i
was
sick
with
pain
once
sick
with
pain
and
an
old
witch
drew
to
my
side
and
healed
me
again
she
was
withered
and
wretched
and
gray
deep
stabbed
with
years
and
the
skin
of
her
face
was
scarred
with
hate
and
tears
she
had
lived
fierce
days
in
that
town
the
flog
hourly
the
neighbours
jibed
cast
stones
at
a
dog
they
had
slandered
her
tricked
her
robbed
her
of
honour
and
purse
but
her
wrongs
slept
deep
in
her
heart
for
the
fiends
to
nurse
one
went
blind
another
stark
mad
he
dead
fruit
of
the
curse
she
flung
old
witch
they
said
life
ran
high
there
men
nourished
their
hates
and
slashed
with
swords
harsh
skies
swerved
to
the
rim
of
the
bay
sweden
seawards
and
i
lay
in
her
bare
clean
room
at
the
stairway
end
and
the
fierce
pain
clutched
me
and
held
me
and
nought
would
fend
o
mother
i
cried
and
she
leaned
to
me
give
me
your
hand
touch
they
have
broken
me
too
and
flung
me
this
same
blind
crutch
and
she
placed
her
hand
in
my
hand
and
her
touch
thrilled
me
and
the
blood
ran
warm
in
my
veins
and
her
dead
life
healed
me
she
was
wasted
arid
as
one
whom
no
sun
cheers
but
her
dead
life
flowered
that
day
down
sixty
years
the
pupil
rhineland
mister
i
do
not
like
the
task
is
dull
you
tired
too
but
mister
i
a
thing
to
ask
i
not
beautiful
speak
true
now
god
save
all
poor
from
innocence
so
rapt
and
sly
and
send
the
plainest
to
one
so
as
i
she
sat
within
my
student
room
in
the
twilight
hour
when
the
shadows
stir
red
lights
of
sunset
swirled
the
gloom
and
rested
glimmering
on
her
hair
coil
upon
coil
it
wreathed
her
crown
in
a
crushing
aureole
of
flame
and
her
brows
of
alabaster
shone
as
pure
as
mary
of
bethlehem
her
eyes
i
never
knew
their
hue
drowsed
smouldering
in
the
burning
dusk
and
somewhere
out
of
the
earth
view
a
planet
sang
and
the
air
breathed
musk
the
bushrangers
as
i
was
walking
down
oxford
street
ten
fierce
soldiers
i
chanced
to
meet
they
wore
big
slouch
hats
with
khaki
sashes
and
talked
like
the
angry
guns
in
flashes
and
my
friend
said
to
me
they
come
from
australia
villainous
fellows
for
war
regalia
john
briton
keeps
a
tobacconist
shed
and
twice
they
have
held
a
gun
at
his
head
well
i
would
have
given
all
i
had
to
have
gone
with
the
bunch
of
them
good
or
bad
to
have
heard
the
wickedest
say
old
fellow
and
staunched
his
wounds
where
the
black
guns
bellow
i
have
thought
it
a
merry
thing
to
die
with
such
stalwart
comrades
standing
by
one
of
them
had
round
eyes
like
coals
true
parson
quarry
when
he
hunts
souls
the
brawniest
made
my
heart
turn
queer
the
devil
in
hell
would
have
shunned
his
leer
and
the
tallest
and
thinnest
bore
visible
traces
of
his
banished
grandsire
vanished
graces
but
all
the
lot
of
that
swaggering
ten
were
terrible
fine
strong
and
i
fairly
sobbed
at
the
four
cross
ways
as
my
triumphing
soul
sang
england
praise
o
all
the
germans
in
berlin
town
could
put
those
ten
australians
down
the
new
beginning
they
had
fought
the
last
desperate
battle
they
had
deluged
the
earth
with
their
rage
and
the
crimson
flood
mounted
to
heaven
and
drew
up
each
soul
from
its
grave
and
sent
them
foeman
with
foeman
to
shatter
the
quiet
of
the
skies
and
lo
they
commingled
together
with
the
hope
of
god
in
their
eyes
and
in
faith
they
went
peacefully
singing
and
waking
dead
stars
to
new
birth
till
earth
knew
heaven
as
her
lover
and
heaven
leaned
down
gracious
to
earth
and
tendered
her
blossoms
of
healing
and
rained
on
her
kindness
of
tears
and
gave
back
in
trust
to
her
lover
the
bloom
of
the
sacrificed
years
a
game
of
chess
we
ranged
the
chessmen
on
the
chequered
deal
and
then
i
said
to
make
the
game
more
real
we
play
the
great
war
i
be
germany
for
you
i
guess
the
goth
would
never
be
and
thus
it
came
that
i
chose
black
he
white
he
on
truth
side
i
clothed
myself
with
night
and
crying
for
a
sign
unto
the
lord
we
cramped
all
europe
in
a
board
we
were
two
causes
i
who
did
detest
that
wrong
should
triumph
though
it
were
in
jest
played
with
cracking
played
with
zest
and
every
beating
battle
drum
i
struck
with
queen
and
pawns
for
belgium
i
never
played
as
on
that
fateful
night
i
fairly
lost
my
temper
in
the
fight
queens
left
their
thrones
pawns
castles
strewed
the
table
there
never
were
two
causes
so
unstable
and
then
when
he
six
pieces
and
i
eight
half
of
them
pawns
he
pulled
the
noose
of
fate
and
with
a
knight
a
castle
unawares
a
bishop
in
a
corner
breathing
prayers
he
caught
me
tripping
checkmate
smashed
he
said
and
like
a
beaten
hun
i
stole
to
bed
snow
my
heart
delights
in
poet
minstrelsie
in
pictures
ranged
down
some
long
gallerie
in
mandolins
and
all
sweet
melodie
and
yet
when
i
go
walking
through
the
woods
on
frosty
days
and
watch
the
falling
snow
i
would
renounce
all
culture
radiant
moods
to
live
in
with
the
eskimo
how
purely
gleams
the
mantle
of
the
snow
how
softly
sing
the
myriad
silver
tongues
of
whirling
flakes
that
wrought
earth
overthrow
with
the
keen
air
i
fill
my
tired
lungs
and
shout
for
joy
and
dance
for
very
mirth
because
all
heaven
has
fallen
down
to
earth
and
in
this
mood
i
save
my
soul
and
so
through
pure
clean
ways
right
into
heaven
go
air
raid
i
wonder
if
they
come
the
round
moon
rolls
in
silvery
light
no
sound
throbs
on
the
windless
air
for
though
i
tremble
to
confess
i
never
feel
more
cheerfulness
than
when
the
german
raiders
fly
like
bees
across
the
cloudless
sky
and
neither
pity
pain
nor
terror
will
ever
wean
me
from
my
error
for
oh
to
hear
the
mad
guns
go
and
watch
the
starry
night
aglow
with
radiance
of
crackling
fires
and
the
white
searchlight
quivering
spires
for
sure
such
splendour
doth
assuage
the
very
cannon
of
its
rage
my
neighbour
plays
a
violin
shredding
sweet
silver
down
the
din
and
songs
for
fears
to
dwindle
in
but
the
houses
shake
and
the
dogs
wake
they
growl
they
bark
for
warrior
joy
and
seek
the
airmen
to
annoy
up
go
their
tails
into
the
air
they
gnash
their
teeth
and
their
eyes
glare
but
on
those
cruel
raiders
sail
regardless
of
each
quivering
tail
and
one
gun
has
a
booming
note
another
has
a
cold
in
throat
and
some
are
mellow
and
some
hoarse
and
some
sound
sobbing
with
remorse
quite
four
or
five
ring
musical
and
others
very
keen
to
kill
you
say
that
twenty
champagne
corks
were
popping
in
the
london
walks
you
say
that
drunken
men
in
scores
were
smashing
glass
and
slamming
doors
you
say
a
twanging
banjo
string
had
snapped
in
twain
with
hammering
you
say
that
wild
orchestral
fellows
were
banging
god
throne
with
their
cellos
a
wail
a
crash
like
steel
trays
falling
and
a
wind
upon
the
common
calling
and
over
us
a
sound
of
humming
of
hornets
or
bad
bees
a
devilish
strident
hoarse
discordant
whirring
of
dark
fliers
mordant
my
soul
stands
still
and
sweats
with
fear
but
the
heavenly
stars
all
shimmering
dance
in
a
giddy
whirl
and
sing
and
other
stars
of
the
earth
shake
sheer
from
the
mouths
of
the
black
guns
thundering
is
like
some
ruining
harmony
i
heard
in
berlin
on
the
spree
the
day
they
played
the
valkyrie
kind
heaven
will
comfort
my
wracked
wits
before
i
blown
to
little
bits
sickness
in
winter
once
as
i
on
lay
i
woke
crying
for
my
mother
but
she
was
eight
hundred
miles
away
leagues
and
leagues
of
sea
between
and
the
land
all
frozen
hard
and
gray
she
was
so
very
old
i
ween
she
could
not
have
moved
a
mile
that
day
for
the
land
was
frozen
stiff
and
gray
and
the
menacing
seas
rolled
all
between
nature
in
if
flowers
could
speak
and
leaves
and
plants
knew
words
in
what
strange
phrase
of
chiding
would
they
seek
to
tell
their
anger
at
this
clash
of
swords
the
blossom
that
was
made
for
joy
and
praise
high
bending
grasses
and
the
trees
so
tall
tremble
for
terror
in
the
forest
ways
i
see
them
shake
and
shake
as
live
men
fall
shrapnel
crushes
them
in
its
fierce
caress
the
black
guns
chant
a
pæan
of
their
skill
but
little
recks
the
world
in
its
distress
the
sorrow
that
is
silent
on
the
hill
courage
i
i
once
a
friend
what
joy
to
say
who
when
he
took
a
holiday
would
climb
the
towering
dolomites
and
strive
with
fear
upon
the
heights
tied
to
a
rope
down
dangling
sheer
he
talk
to
god
through
clouds
of
fear
o
give
me
friends
like
that
i
say
and
such
a
gallant
holiday
ii
i
another
friend
in
another
pale
who
spent
a
holiday
in
jail
he
fought
for
what
his
heart
deemed
right
and
they
shut
him
up
in
walls
of
night
yet
merrily
his
heart
did
sing
like
a
mating
bird
that
hails
the
spring
aunt
zillah
speaks
i
never
look
upon
the
sea
and
hear
its
waves
sighing
but
i
must
hie
me
home
again
to
still
my
heart
wild
crying
all
my
years
like
drowned
sailors
all
my
days
that
used
to
be
seem
drifting
in
the
silver
spray
and
mourning
by
the
sea
but
when
i
take
a
holiday
i
go
where
flowers
are
growing
where
thrushes
sing
and
skylarks
wing
and
happy
streams
are
flowing
and
the
great
hills
clothed
with
bracken
as
far
as
i
would
flee
fling
their
towering
crests
to
the
stars
on
high
to
hide
me
from
the
sea
talking
to
god
a
fighting
man
lay
down
for
ease
in
the
shade
of
two
tall
forest
trees
deep
dinted
with
bullet
and
shell
and
one
tree
said
to
the
other
is
not
this
worn
soldier
our
brother
and
has
he
not
vowed
to
defend
this
strip
of
green
glade
till
the
end
let
us
thank
the
kind
father
in
heaven
for
this
kinship
of
man
he
has
given
the
trees
talked
to
god
all
the
night
and
they
thrilled
with
a
soaring
delight
sacrifice
when
jesus
was
crucified
the
german
roamed
in
his
forests
and
the
blood
of
the
frenchman
surged
in
the
veins
of
the
roman
who
pierced
his
side
and
we
the
british
we
were
not
though
a
dream
that
he
cherished
and
for
each
and
all
christ
died
prophecy
when
the
cruel
war
is
over
the
earth
will
sing
like
a
lover
and
grasses
flowers
and
trees
will
shake
with
joy
in
the
breeze
very
old
weary
men
will
know
their
youth
again
and
be
blithe
as
england
soldiers
when
they
first
sailed
the
seas
and
wisdom
lately
spent
will
steal
forth
from
banishment
all
betimes
in
the
morning
like
a
bride
to
her
adorning
gay
and
very
wistful
singing
with
her
heart
full
she
will
hide
her
forehead
scars
with
the
fairest
of
heaven
stars
and
the
tongue
will
leap
with
the
brain
and
not
clank
in
a
forger
chain
as
it
has
been
heretofore
with
truth
jailer
at
the
door
as
it
was
on
this
globe
prison
ere
the
soul
of
man
had
risen
and
the
dead
in
the
morning
dim
will
reign
as
the
seraphim
they
will
fan
to
flame
man
spirit
to
a
whiter
purer
merit
there
will
be
a
new
beginning
and
some
shall
cease
from
sinning
when
the
bitter
strife
is
over
and
the
earth
is
heaven
lover
talking
water
last
night
i
walked
in
the
fern
lands
and
heard
the
words
of
the
brooks
what
need
has
a
weary
man
spirit
with
phrases
from
books
the
timid
fish
splashed
in
the
shallows
the
sad
wind
sobbed
in
the
reeds
and
i
soothed
with
the
whispering
water
a
wound
that
bleeds
the
end
a
poet
lay
dead
where
two
red
frontiers
meet
and
many
birds
fluttered
about
his
feet
he
had
unfurled
his
last
wild
madrigal
and
winds
had
borne
it
where
the
dead
leaves
fall
the
thrush
may
mottled
elf
the
minstrel
sang
more
harsh
than
was
his
wont
the
blackbird
rang
strange
sobbing
woodland
bells
the
finch
so
sweet
lay
with
glazed
eye
and
raised
each
shattered
wing
and
cried
in
sudden
pain
but
could
not
sing
the
sparrow
twittered
is
dark
under
the
eaves
and
margot
sits
at
home
and
grieves
the
lark
said
god
is
angry
in
bright
heaven
i
saw
him
once
a
great
white
fluttering
bird
with
beautiful
broad
wings
that
oft
are
heard
when
the
wind
beats
the
blue
nave
of
the
skies
i
saw
him
perching
high
upon
the
moon
with
the
most
dreadful
anguish
in
his
eyes
he
flaps
his
wings
and
tries
and
wildly
tries
but
can
sing
no
longer
it
is
still
in
heaven
it
is
still
in
forest
and
on
hill
the
green
leaves
wither
and
the
world
grows
chill
a
sinn
feiner
i
once
had
the
trustiest
comrade
god
grant
he
thinks
kindly
of
me
and
we
always
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
when
a
tossing
wind
troubled
life
sea
he
was
like
the
marsh
fire
in
fair
weather
though
in
foul
we
made
merry
together
but
his
soul
was
knit
to
the
whirlwind
the
fen
mists
but
shrouded
the
flame
and
i
knew
not
our
friendship
attachment
till
the
day
that
the
whirlwind
came
for
i
saw
our
lives
broken
asunder
and
watched
him
away
with
the
thunder
men
said
he
consorted
with
traitors
and
marshalled
the
beasts
of
the
sty
but
i
know
that
mere
mischief
makers
do
joyfully
go
forth
to
die
and
i
lost
a
friend
like
a
brother
and
never
i
know
such
another
the
foreign
legionary
he
had
just
come
out
of
prison
and
he
stood
and
scowled
apart
the
old
lust
his
ragged
coat
and
the
cold
hate
in
his
heart
and
he
peered
to
right
and
left
through
the
cruel
sleet
and
rain
then
dived
into
the
nearest
street
to
rob
and
steal
again
he
lay
wounded
in
the
desert
where
the
thirsty
sand
gleamed
red
arab
spearmen
thrusting
at
the
dying
and
the
dead
he
had
left
the
shrunken
ranks
to
save
a
comrade
in
the
rear
and
he
raised
himself
and
cursed
them
and
went
down
beneath
a
spear
he
lies
and
stares
at
heaven
through
a
cloud
of
crows
and
kites
while
round
him
prowl
the
jackals
in
the
lurid
tropic
nights
and
he
slowly
bleach
to
powder
the
sunlight

man
