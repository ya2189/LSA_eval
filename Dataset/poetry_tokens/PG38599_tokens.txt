distinguished
gift
in
a
new
form
and
will
be
welcomed
as
an
important
contribution
to
religious
verse
the
miracle
songs
of
jesus
jesus
the
poet
of
galilee
fashioned
the
light
in
his
lyric
hands
and
held
it
up
for
all
men
to
see
the
publican
and
the
pharisee
the
merchant
rich
and
the
robber
bands
on
the
outcast
fringe
of
galilee
but
all
of
the
wise
men
sneered
at
him
and
the
gay
young
fellows
jeered
at
him
and
only
a
fisherman
fool
or
two
looked
up
at
the
light
with
its
liquid
hue
and
drank
its
beauty
of
red
and
blue
jesus
the
poet
of
galilee
sang
that
the
weary
might
be
free
sang
of
the
lilies
how
their
glory
shamed
the
best
at
a
king
command
sang
his
truths
in
a
lyric
story
even
the
poor
could
understand
and
the
wise
men
heard
and
they
tried
to
scan
the
rhymes
of
the
poet
but
every
time
that
he
sang
they
found
some
cherished
rule
of
their
pedant
school
was
killed
in
his
poem
strange
new
sound
and
jesus
the
poet
grew
sick
at
heart
and
fled
from
the
halls
where
learning
kills
and
took
his
verse
from
the
fear
of
art
to
the
bold
delight
of
the
hills
and
the
songs
he
sang
to
the
desert
sea
were
far
too
sweet
for
the
ears
of
men
but
the
dunes
of
galilee
have
blown
with
a
fairer
flower
since
then
a
learned
group
of
dons
will
gloat
at
a
fool
last
word
in
a
high
priest
throat
but
the
song
of
god
in
a
carpenter
saw
could
never
hold
wise
men
in
awe
and
whenever
christ
the
bard
would
sing
they
lost
his
truth
in
a
hammer
ring
the
wilderness
called
with
her
silent
lure
o
poet
of
thoughtless
nazareth
come
out
to
me
with
your
starry
breath
and
his
white
reed
yearned
for
the
sands
where
the
frayed
flowers
cure
with
their
gypsy
hands
but
he
turned
his
face
from
the
silent
place
with
the
comrade
stars
above
as
we
all
have
done
as
we
all
have
done
from
a
maid
we
dare
not
love
and
the
silent
desert
called
again
o
poet
of
thoughtless
nazareth
come
out
to
me
with
your
fragrant
breath
and
walk
with
me
in
the
moon
white
rain
but
a
blind
man
stick
on
a
hollow
stone
as
it
slowly
tapped
through
a
distant
city
and
a
broken
woman
hopeless
moan
called
out
to
him
with
a
deeper
tone
and
the
heart
of
the
lord
was
pity
and
back
to
the
town
the
poet
came
and
took
his
feet
to
the
temple
hall
and
heard
the
boast
of
a
man
named
saul
and
he
heard
saul
mock
in
a
fiery
tongue
the
sweetest
songs
which
his
heart
had
sung
but
jesus
of
nazareth
then
and
there
could
scarce
forbear
from
a
fond
embrace
knowing
the
beauty
the
man
should
wear
at
another
time
in
another
place
the
critics
were
many
in
jesus
day
and
his
songs
were
scorned
by
the
caustic
pen
he
did
not
write
in
the
grecian
way
and
he
knew
not
how
to
preach
or
pray
in
a
way
approved
of
men
his
themes
were
bad
by
the
roman
chart
and
his
metres
all
were
wrong
for
all
of
the
high
priests
had
their
art
and
he
had
only
his
song
now
few
of
the
people
cared
to
hear
the
poet
blow
on
his
starry
reeds
so
he
took
his
gift
from
the
soul
high
sphere
the
miracle
song
that
few
would
hear
and
lowered
his
power
in
a
hopeless
hour
and
made
men
cower
at
his
miracle
deeds
a
miracle
deed
is
a
simple
thing
to
a
miracle
song
or
a
miracle
truth
yet
they
marvelled
not
that
a
song
could
bring
to
the
veins
of
time
the
world
lost
youth
and
two
were
gathered
and
sometimes
three
to
hear
the
poet
of
galilee
but
the
mob
swept
down
like
leaves
in
a
storm
when
they
heard
the
miracle
man
would
perform
and
the
lame
men
walked
and
the
blind
men
saw
and
the
dead
men
breathed
by
a
strange
new
law
but
they
were
few
to
the
throng
who
saw
and
breathed
through
the
poet
song
when
they
sat
and
fed
on
the
fish
and
bread
five
thousand
men
was
an
easy
count
and
the
deed
was
done
but
sun
will
still
bring
throngs
to
the
and
i
am
sure
that
john
or
mary
cared
not
a
whit
when
he
walked
the
sea
but
i
am
sure
that
they
loved
to
tarry
and
hear
the
poet
of
galilee
and
of
the
throng
that
around
him
pressed
was
john
and
mary
that
he
loved
best
and
when
the
poet
sat
down
to
choose
the
men
to
take
to
the
world
his
news
he
sought
no
men
who
had
held
their
dishes
to
catch
his
gift
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
but
he
chose
them
out
of
the
purer
throngs
who
came
to
hear
his
miracle
songs
and
when
at
last
he
went
up
a
hill
to
seal
his
songs
with
the
seal
of
death
whose
were
the
hands
that
were
raised
to
kill
this
brave
young
poet
of
nazareth
the
man
who
thrust
at
his
side
i
find
was
a
man
who
saw
him
heal
the
blind
and
the
men
who
fed
on
the
fish
and
bread
were
cheering
the
deed
in
the
ranks
behind
but
in
a
group
which
had
drawn
apart
to
pour
their
tears
for
his
broken
heart
were
the
ones
who
heard
his
miracle
word
if
all
of
the
miracle
deeds
of
christ
had
proven
birth
in
a
womb
of
lies
my
spirit
would
still
with
him
keep
tryst
with
faith
as
deep
as
the
skies
but
why
should
i
doubt
so
simple
a
thing
as
a
miracle
deed
from
a
man
who
could
sing
a
miracle
song
that
sheds
its
power
in
a
pure
white
light
to
the
world
last
hour
the
temple
bells
ring
out
and
the
pharisees
pray
in
their
ancient
way
and
the
lips
of
the
preachers
love
to
tarry
on
the
virgin
birth
and
the
miracle
deed
but
the
temple
bells
i
shall
not
heed
for
i
am
going
with
john
and
mary
out
on
the
hills
with
the
slender
throngs
who
love
to
hear
the
miracle
songs
