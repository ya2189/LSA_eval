framingham
mass
to
this
volume
is
inscribed
in
memory
of
many
days
though
i
dreamed
of
mountain
heights
of
peaks
the
barriers
of
the
world
around
whose
tops
the
northern
lights
and
tempests
are
are
the
footpaths
leading
through
life
lowly
fields
and
woods
with
rifts
above
of
heaven
eden
blue
by
which
the
violet
shy
appeal
and
holding
up
its
chaliced
gold
like
some
wild
wine
along
the
hillside
cup
on
cup
blooms
bright
the
soft
upon
each
flowering
stock
the
butterfly
spreads
damask
wings
and
under
grassy
loam
and
rock
the
cottage
cricket
overhead
eve
blooms
with
fire
in
which
the
new
moon
bends
her
bow
and
one
white
star
by
her
burns
through
the
care
not
so
the
sesame
i
find
the
magic
flower
there
whose
touch
unseals
each
mystery
in
water
earth
and
in
the
oak
tree
lets
me
hear
its
heart
deep
speech
its
soul
wise
words
and
to
my
mind
makes
crystal
clear
the
melodies
of
should
i
care
who
live
aloof
beyond
the
din
of
life
and
dust
while
dreams
still
share
my
humble
roof
and
love
makes
sweet
my
crust
one
day
and
another
lyrical
part
i
late
spring
mottled
moth
at
eventide
beats
glimmering
wings
against
the
pane
the
slow
sweet
lily
opens
wide
white
in
the
dusk
like
some
dim
stain
the
garden
dreams
on
every
side
and
breathes
faint
scents
of
rain
among
the
flowering
stocks
they
stand
a
crimson
rose
is
in
his
her
garden
he
waits
herein
the
dearness
of
her
is
the
thirty
perfect
days
of
june
made
one
in
maiden
loveliness
were
not
more
sweet
to
clasp
and
kiss
with
love
not
more
in
tune
ah
me
i
think
she
is
too
true
too
spiritual
for
life
rough
way
for
in
her
eyes
her
soul
looks
new
two
bluet
blossoms
are
not
so
pure
as
they
so
good
so
beautiful
is
she
so
soft
and
white
so
fond
and
fair
sometimes
my
heart
fears
she
may
be
not
long
for
me
and
secretly
a
sister
of
the
air
deepens
a
whippoorwill
the
whippoorwills
are
calling
where
the
golden
west
is
graying
is
time
they
say
to
meet
him
there
why
are
you
still
delaying
he
waits
you
where
the
old
beech
throws
its
gnarly
shadow
over
and
the
bramble
rose
frail
and
clover
where
elder
and
the
sumach
creep
above
your
garden
paling
whereon
at
noon
the
lizards
sleep
like
lichens
on
the
railing
come
ere
the
early
rising
gold
floods
the
violet
valleys
where
mists
like
phantom
picaroons
anchor
their
stealthy
galleys
come
while
the
deepening
amethyst
of
dusk
above
is
falling
is
time
to
tryst
is
time
to
tryst
the
whippoorwills
are
calling
they
call
you
to
these
twilight
ways
with
dewy
odor
dripping
ah
girlhood
through
the
rosy
haze
come
like
a
moonbeam
slipping
enters
her
garden
speaking
dreamily
there
is
a
fading
inward
of
the
day
and
all
the
pansy
heaven
clasps
one
star
the
dwindling
acres
eastward
glimmer
gray
while
all
the
world
to
westward
smoulders
far
now
to
your
glass
will
you
pass
for
the
last
time
pass
humming
some
ballad
i
know
here
where
i
wait
it
is
late
and
is
past
time
late
and
the
moments
are
slow
are
slow
there
is
a
drawing
downward
of
the
night
the
bridegroom
heaven
bends
down
to
kiss
the
moon
above
the
heights
hang
silver
in
her
light
below
the
woods
stretch
purple
deep
in
june
there
in
the
dew
is
it
you
hiding
lawny
you
or
a
moth
in
the
vines
you
by
your
hand
where
the
band
twinkles
tawny
you
by
your
ring
like
a
glowworm
that
shines
approaches
laughing
she
speaks
you
given
up
hope
he
believe
me
she
why
is
your
love
so
poor
he
i
knew
you
not
deceive
me
she
as
many
a
girl
before
ah
dear
you
will
forgive
me
he
say
no
more
sweet
say
no
more
she
love
trusts
and
that
enough
my
dear
trust
wins
to
trust
whereof
my
dear
love
holds
to
love
and
love
my
dear
is
well
that
all
my
lore
he
come
pay
me
or
i
scold
give
me
the
kiss
you
you
fly
when
i
enfold
you
she
no
no
i
say
now
no
how
often
have
i
told
you
you
must
not
treat
me
so
he
more
sweet
the
dusk
for
this
is
for
lips
that
meet
in
come
come
why
run
from
blisses
as
from
a
mortal
foe
stands
smiling
at
him
she
speaks
how
many
words
in
the
asking
how
easily
i
can
grieve
you
my
no
in
a
yes
was
nor
thought
dear
to
deceive
a
kiss
the
happiness
here
in
my
heart
consents
but
what
are
words
when
the
thought
of
two
souls
in
speech
accords
affirmative
negative
what
are
they
dear
i
wished
to
say
yes
but
somehow
said
no
the
woman
within
me
thought
you
would
know
thought
that
your
heart
would
hear
speaks
so
many
hopes
in
a
wooing
therein
you
could
not
deceive
me
some
things
are
sweeter
for
the
pursuing
i
knew
what
you
meant
believe
bunched
bells
of
the
blush
pomegranate
to
fix
at
your
throat
six
drops
of
fire
they
are
will
you
look
where
the
moon
and
its
following
star
rise
silvery
over
yon
meadow
ricks
while
i
hold
while
i
lean
your
head
back
so
for
i
know
it
is
yes
though
you
whisper
no
and
my
kisses
sweet
are
six
flutter
around
them
she
speaks
look
where
the
fiery
in
briery
banks
of
the
bowers
sparkles
how
hazily
pinioned
and
arily
delicate
warily
drowsily
lazily
flutter
the
moths
to
the
flowers
white
as
the
dreamiest
bud
of
the
creamiest
rose
in
the
garden
that
dozes
see
how
they
cling
to
them
held
in
the
heart
of
their
hearts
like
a
part
of
their
perfume
they
swing
to
them
wings
that
are
soft
as
the
roses
dim
as
the
forming
of
dew
in
the
warming
of
moonlight
they
light
on
the
petals
all
is
revealed
to
them
all
from
the
sunniest
tips
to
the
honiest
heart
whence
they
yield
to
them
spice
through
the
darkness
that
settles
so
to
our
tremulous
souls
come
the
emulous
spirits
of
love
through
whose
power
all
that
is
best
in
us
all
that
is
beautiful
all
that
is
dutiful
is
made
confessed
in
us
even
as
the
scent
of
a
flower
her
hand
he
says
what
makes
you
beautiful
answer
now
answer
is
it
that
dutiful
souls
are
all
beautiful
that
romance
or
beauty
of
spirit
which
souls
of
merit
of
heaven
inherit
have
you
no
answer
roguishly
what
makes
you
lovable
answer
dear
answer
is
it
not
provable
that
man
is
lovable
just
because
chance
or
nature
makes
woman
love
him
her
human
part
to
have
you
no
answer
regarding
him
seriously
she
continues
could
i
recall
every
joy
that
befell
me
there
in
the
past
with
its
anguish
and
bliss
here
in
my
heart
it
has
whispered
to
tell
me
those
were
no
joys
like
this
were
it
not
well
if
our
love
could
forget
them
veiling
the
with
the
dawn
of
the
dead
with
the
past
we
should
never
regret
them
being
no
joys
like
this
when
they
were
gone
and
the
present
stood
speechful
ardent
in
word
and
in
look
and
in
kiss
what
though
we
know
that
their
eyes
are
beseechful
those
were
no
joys
like
this
is
it
not
well
to
have
more
of
the
spirit
living
for
futures
where
naught
is
amiss
less
of
the
flesh
with
the
past
pining
near
it
is
there
a
joy
like
this
the
garden
for
the
lane
he
with
lightness
of
we
will
leave
reason
sweet
for
a
season
reason
were
treason
now
that
the
nether
spaces
are
clad
oh
in
silvery
shadow
we
will
be
glad
oh
glad
as
this
weather
responding
to
his
mood
heart
unto
heart
where
the
moonlight
is
slanted
let
us
believe
that
our
souls
are
enchanted
i
in
the
you
are
the
airy
prince
who
comes
seeking
me
love
is
the
fairy
bringing
our
hearts
together
he
starlight
in
masses
over
us
passes
and
in
the
grass
is
many
a
flower
now
will
you
tell
me
how
you
enspell
me
what
once
befell
me
there
in
your
bower
she
soul
unto
soul
in
the
moon
wizard
glory
let
us
believe
we
are
parts
in
a
story
i
am
a
poem
a
poet
you
hear
it
whispered
in
star
and
in
flower
a
spirit
love
puts
my
soul
in
your
power
suddenly
and
very
earnestly
perhaps
we
lived
in
the
days
of
the
khalif
haroun
er
reshid
and
loved
as
the
story
says
did
the
sultan
favorite
one
and
the
persian
emperor
son
ali
ben
bekkar
he
of
the
kisra
dynasty
do
you
know
the
story
well
you
were
haroun
sultana
when
night
on
the
palace
fell
a
slave
through
a
secret
door
on
the
tigris
shore
by
a
hidden
winding
stair
brought
me
to
your
bower
there
then
there
was
laughter
and
mirth
and
feasting
and
singing
together
in
a
chamber
of
wonderful
worth
in
a
chamber
vaulted
high
on
columns
of
ivory
its
dome
like
the
irised
skies
mooned
over
with
peacock
eyes
its
curtains
and
furniture
damask
and
juniper
ten
slave
girls
like
unto
blooms
stand
holding
tamarisk
torches
from
the
irak
looms
ten
handmaidens
serve
the
feast
each
girl
like
a
star
in
the
east
ten
lutanists
lutes
wait
each
like
the
ramadan
moon
for
you
in
a
stuff
of
merv
unveiled
and
jewelled
no
metaphor
known
may
serve
scarved
deep
with
your
raven
hair
the
jewels
like
fireflies
there
blossom
and
moon
and
star
the
lady
shemsennehar
the
zone
that
girdles
your
waist
would
ransom
a
prince
and
emeer
in
your
coronet
gold
enchased
and
your
bracelet
twisted
bar
burn
rubies
of
istakhar
and
pearls
of
the
jamshid
race
hang
looped
on
your
bosom
lace
you
stand
like
the
letter
i
with
eyes
that
sparkle
black
stars
in
a
rosy
sky
mouth
like
a
cloven
peach
sweet
with
your
smiling
speech
cheeks
that
the
blood
presumes
to
make
pomegranate
blooms
with
roses
of
rocknabad
hyacinths
of
bokhara
creamily
cool
and
clad
in
gauze
girls
scatter
the
floor
from
pillar
to
cedarn
door
then
a
at
each
ear
come
the
dancing
girls
of
kashmeer
kohl
in
their
eyes
down
the
room
that
opaline
have
showered
with
rose
perfume
they
glitter
and
drift
and
swoon
to
the
dulcimer
languishing
tune
in
the
liquid
light
like
stars
and
moons
and
nenuphars
carbuncles
smoulder
in
armlet
and
anklet
gleaming
on
breast
and
on
head
bangles
of
coins
that
are
angled
tinkle
and
veils
that
are
spangled
flutter
from
coiffure
and
wrist
like
a
mist
each
is
a
flower
of
the
tuba
from
vales
of
el
how
the
bronzen
censers
glower
and
scents
of
ambergris
pour
and
myrrh
brought
of
lahore
and
musk
of
khoten
how
good
is
the
scent
of
the
a
lutanist
smites
her
lute
sings
loves
of
mejnoon
and
leila
her
voice
is
a
houri
flute
while
the
fragrant
flambeaux
wave
barbaric
free
and
slave
fabrics
and
bezels
of
gems
and
roses
in
anadems
sherbets
in
ewers
of
gold
fruits
in
salvers
carnelian
flagons
of
grotesque
mold
made
of
a
sapphire
glass
brimmed
with
wine
of
shiraz
shaddock
and
melon
and
grape
on
plate
of
an
antique
shape
vases
of
frosted
rose
of
limpid
alabaster
filled
with
the
mountain
snows
goblets
of
one
filigree
vessels
of
gold
foamed
up
with
spray
of
spar
on
the
cup
then
a
slave
bursts
in
with
a
cry
the
eunuchs
the
khalif
eunuchs
with
scimitars
bared
draw
nigh
wesif
and
afif
and
he
chief
of
the
hideous
three
mesrour
the
sultan
seen
a
hundred
weapons
sheen
did
we
part
when
we
heard
this
no
it
seems
that
my
soul
remembers
how
i
clasped
you
and
kissed
you
so
when
they
came
they
found
us
dead
on
the
flowers
our
blood
dyed
red
our
lips
together
and
the
dagger
in
my
hand
musingly
how
it
was
i
can
not
tell
for
i
know
not
where
nor
why
but
perhaps
we
loved
too
well
in
some
world
that
does
not
lie
east
or
west
of
where
we
dwell
and
beneath
no
mortal
sky
was
it
in
the
golden
ages
or
the
iron
i
had
heard
in
the
prophecy
of
sages
haply
how
had
come
a
bird
underneath
whose
wing
were
pages
of
an
unknown
lover
word
i
forget
you
may
remember
how
the
earthquake
shook
our
ships
how
our
city
one
huge
ember
blazed
within
the
thick
eclipse
when
you
found
me
deep
december
sealed
my
icy
eyes
and
lips
i
forget
no
one
may
say
that
such
things
can
not
be
true
here
a
flower
dies
and
blooms
anew
death
is
tell
me
pray
why
men
doubt
what
god
can
do
with
as
to
that
nothing
to
tell
you
being
all
my
belief
doubt
may
not
enter
or
dwell
here
where
your
image
is
chief
here
where
your
name
is
a
spell
potent
in
joy
and
in
grief
is
it
the
glamor
of
spring
working
in
us
so
we
seem
aye
to
have
loved
that
we
cling
even
to
some
fancy
or
dream
rainbowing
everything
here
in
our
souls
with
its
gleam
see
how
the
synod
is
met
there
of
the
heavens
to
preach
us
freed
from
the
earth
oubliette
see
how
the
blossoms
beseech
us
were
it
not
well
to
forget
winter
and
night
as
they
teach
us
dew
and
a
bud
and
a
star
these
like
a
beautiful
thought
over
man
wisdom
how
far
god
for
some
purpose
has
wrought
and
though
they
that
which
they
are
what
are
the
thoughts
they
have
brought
stars
and
the
moon
and
they
roll
over
our
way
that
is
white
here
shall
we
end
the
long
stroll
here
shall
i
kiss
you
or
for
a
while
soul
to
soul
linger
and
dream
of
delight
enter
the
garden
again
she
somewhat
myths
tell
of
walls
and
cities
that
arose
to
melody
but
i
would
build
with
tone
had
i
that
harp
a
world
for
us
alone
a
world
of
love
and
joy
and
deep
repose
a
land
of
lavender
light
of
skies
pale
peaks
that
rise
against
the
gold
of
eve
and
on
one
height
the
splendors
never
leave
our
castled
home
which
the
wild
swan
flies
there
pitiless
the
ruined
hand
of
death
should
never
reach
no
bud
no
thing
should
fade
all
should
be
perfect
pure
and
unafraid
and
life
serener
than
an
angel
breath
the
days
should
move
to
music
wildly
tame
the
nights
should
move
to
music
and
the
stars
and
morn
and
evening
in
their
opal
cars
like
heralds
banner
god
eternal
name
o
world
o
life
desired
and
to
be
how
shall
we
reach
thee
dark
the
way
and
dim
give
me
your
hand
love
let
us
follow
him
love
with
the
mystery
and
the
melody
observing
the
various
flowers
around
them
violets
and
anemones
the
surrendered
hours
pour
as
handsels
round
the
knees
of
the
spring
who
to
the
breeze
flings
her
myriad
flowers
like
to
coins
the
sumptuous
day
strews
with
blossoms
golden
every
furlong
of
his
way
like
a
sultan
gone
to
pray
at
a
kaaba
olden
and
the
night
with
spark
on
spark
clad
in
dim
attire
dots
with
stars
the
haloed
dark
as
a
priest
around
the
ark
lights
his
lamps
of
fire
these
are
but
the
cosmic
strings
to
the
harp
of
beauty
to
that
instrument
which
sings
in
our
souls
of
love
that
brings
peace
and
faith
and
duty
seriously
duty
comfort
of
the
sinner
and
the
saint
when
grief
and
trial
weigh
us
and
within
our
inner
selves
responsive
to
love
viol
hope
soft
voice
grows
thin
and
thinner
it
is
kin
to
through
whose
feeling
we
are
gainer
though
we
loser
all
the
finer
force
revealing
of
our
natures
no

healing
of
the
wound
of
which
we

some
one
said
no

revealeth
song
its
soul
that
overfloweth
never

heart
feeleth
such

love
unconscious
if
it
healeth
after
a
pause
lightly
an
elf
there
is
who
stables
the
hot
red
wasp
that
stings
on
the
apricot
an
elf
who
rowels
his
spiteful
bay
like
a
mote
on
a
ray
away
away
an
elf
who
saddles
the
hornet
lean
to
din
i
the
ear
o
the
swinging
bean
who
straddles
with
cap
cocked
all
awry
the
back
o

and
this
is
the
elf
who
sips
and
sips
from
whence
the
perfume
drips
and
drunk
with
dew
in
the
glimmering
gloam
awaits
the
coming
home
in
ambush
lies
where
none
may
see
and
robs
the
caravan
gold
bags
of
honey
the
bees
must
pay
to
the
bandit
elf
of
the
fairy
way
another
ouphen
the
butterflies
know
who
paints
their
wings
with
the
hues
that
glow
on
squeezing
from
tubes
of
dew
pansy
colors
of
every
hue
on
his
bloom
pied
pallet
he
paints
the
wings
of
the
butterflies
moths
and
other
things
this
is
the
elf
that
the
hollyhocks
hear
who
dangles
a
brilliant
in
each
one
ear
teases
at
noon
the
pane
green
fly
and
lights
at
night
the
eye
but
the
dearest
elf
so
the
poets
say
is
the
elf
who
hides
in
an
eye
of
gray
who
curls
in
a
dimple
and
slips
along
the
strings
of
a
lute
to
a
lover
song
who
smiles
in
her
smile
and
frowns
in
her
frown
and
dreams
in
the
scent
of
her
glove
or
gown
hides
and
beckons
as
all
may
note
in
the
bloom
or
the
bow
of
a
maiden
throat
standing
among
the
flowers
soft
through
the
trees
the
night
wind
sighs
and
swoons
and
dies
above
the
stars
hang
wanly
white
here
through
the
dark
a
drizzled
gold
the
fireflies
rain
mimic
stars
in
spark
on
is
time
to
part
to
say
from
fern
to
flower
the
cross
at
drowsy
loss
the
moon
drifts
veiled
through
clouds
of
white
and
pearly
pale
a
silver
blur
through
beds
of
moss
their
tiny
moons
the
is
time
to
part
to
say
at
parting
as
they
proceed
down
the
garden
you
say
you
can
not
wed
me
now
that
roses
and
the
june
are
here
to
your
decision
i
must
ah
well
is
just
as
well
my
dear
we
swear
again
each
old
love
vow
and
wait
another
year
another
year
of
love
with
you
of
dreams
and
doubts
of
sun
and
rain
when
field
and
forest
bloom
anew
and
locust
clusters
pelt
the
lane
when
all
the
wed
and
woo
i
not
take
no
again
oft
shall
i
lie
awake
and
mark
the
hours
by
no
clanging
clock
but
in
the
dim
and
distant
dark
the
crowing
of
some
punctual
cock
then
up
as
early
as
the
lark
to
meet
you
by
our
rock
the
rock
where
first
we
met
at
tryst
where
first
i
wooed
and
won
your
love
remember
how
the
moon
and
mist
made
mystery
of
the
heaven
above
as
now
how
first
i
kissed
your
lips
you
trembling
like
a
dove
so
then
you
can
not
wed
me
now
that
roses
and
the
june
are
here
that
warmth
and
fragrance
weigh
each
bough
and
yet
your
reason
is
not
clear
ah
well
we
swear
anew
each
vow
and
wait
another
year
part
ii
early
summer
cricket
in
the
hedge
sings
by
the
gate
the
slim
moon
slants
a
timid
edge
of
pearl
through
one
low
cloud
of
slate
around
dark
door
and
like
dreams
the
shadows
wait
and
through
the
summer
dusk
she
goes
on
her
white
breast
a
crimson
delays
meditating
a
rainy
gray
skies
and
the
foggy
rain
dripping
from
sullen
eaves
over
and
over
again
dull
drop
of
the
trickling
leaves
and
the
lane
and
the
hill
with
its
shocks
of
sheaves
one
scarce
perceives
shall
i
go
in
such
wet
weather
by
the
lane
or
over
the
hill
where
the
blossoming
milkweed
feather
the
drops
like
diamonds
fill
where
draggled
and
drenched
together
the
rank
the
rill
to
the
old
the
creek
by
now
is
swollen
and
its
foaming
cascades
sound
and
the
lilies
smeared
with
pollen
in
the
dam
look
dull
and
drowned
is
a
path
i
oft
have
stolen
to
the
bridge
that
rambles
round
with
willows
bound
through
a
valley
wild
with
berry
packed
thick
with
the
and
elder
washed
and
very
fragrant
the
fenced
path
leads
past
oak
and
wilding
cherry
to
a
place
of
flags
and
reeds
that
the
water
bredes
the
sun
through
the
sad
sky
bleaches
is
that
a
thrush
that
calls
that
bird
who
so
beseeches
and
see
on
the
balsam
balls
and
leaves
of
the
one
blister
of
galls
no
raindrop
falls
my
shawl
instead
of
a
bonnet
though
the
woods
be
soaking
yet
through
the
wet
to
the
rock
i
run
it
how
sweet
to
meet
i
the
wet
our
rock
with
the
vine
upon
it
each
flower
a
fiery
jet
where
oft
we
met
meet
he
how
fresh
the
purple
clover
smells
in
its
veil
of
rain
and
where
the
leaves
brim
over
how
fragrant
is
the
lane
see
how
the
sodden
acres
forlorn
of
all
their
rakers
their
hay
and
harvest
makers
look
green
as
spring
again
drops
from
the
trumpet
flowers
rain
on
us
as
we
pass
and
every
zephyr
showers
from
tilted
leaf
or
grass
clear
beads
of
moisture
seeming
pale
pointed
emeralds
gleaming
where
through
the
green
boughs
streaming
the
daylight
strikes
like
glass
how
dewy
clean
and
fragrant
look
now
the
green
and
gold
and
breezes
trailing
vagrant
spill
all
the
spice
they
hold
the
west
begins
to
glimmer
and
shadows
stretching
slimmer
crouch
on
the
ways
and
dimmer
grow
field
and
forest
old
beyond
those
rainy
reaches
of
woodland
far
and
lone
a
whippoorwill
beseeches
and
now
an
owl
vague
moan
strikes
faint
upon
the
these
say
the
dusk
is
nearing
and
see
the
heavens
clearing
take
on
a
tender
tone
how
feebly
chirps
the
cricket
how
thin
the
cry
blurred
in
the
thicket
gleams
wet
the
this
way
toward
home
is
nearest
of
weeds
and
briars
clearest
we
meet
dearest
till
then
dear
heart
meet
again
under
the
greenwood
tree
he
speaks
here
at
last
and
do
you
know
that
again
you
kept
me
waiting
wondering
anticipating
if
your
yes
meant
no
now
you
here
we
have
our
day
let
us
take
this
daisied
hollow
and
beneath
these
beeches
follow
this
wild
strip
of
way
towards
the
stream
wherein
are
seen
stealing
gar
and
darting
minnow
over
which
winnow
wings
of
black
and
green
like
a
cactus
flames
the
sun
and
the
mighty
weaver
even
tenuous
colored
there
in
heaven
his
rich
weft
begun
how
i
love
you
from
the
time
you
remember
do
you
not
when
within
your
i
was
reading
rhyme
as
i
told
you
and
was
thus
by
the
blue
trinacrian
sea
far
in
pastoral
sicily
with
theocritus
that
i
answered
you
who
asked
but
the
curious
part
was
this
that
the
whole
thing
was
amiss
that
the
greek
but
masked
tales
of
old
boccaccio
tall
decameronian
maids
strolled
among
italian
glades
smiling
sweet
and
slow
and
when
you
approached
my
book
dropped
in
wonder
seemingly
to
myself
i
said
is
she
and
arose
to
look
in
lauretta
eyes
and
true
found
them
you
shook
your
head
laughing
at
me
as
you
said
did
i
frighten
you
you
had
come
for
cherries
these
dreamily
i
climbed
for
while
you
still
questioned
with
a
smile
and
still
tried
to
tease
ah
love
just
two
years
have
gone
since
then
i
remember
you
wore
a
dress
of
billowy
blue
muslin
or
of
lawn
and
that
apron
still
i
see
white
with
which
you
held
wherein
i
rained
ripeness
from
the
tree
and
i
asked
you
for
you
know
to
my
eyes
your
serious
eyes
spoke
such
sweet
philosophies
if
you
read
rousseau
you
remember
how
a
chance
somewhat
like
to
mine
one
june
happened
him
at
castle
toune
over
there
in
france
and
a
cherry
dropping
fair
on
your
cheek
i
envying
it
said
remembering
rousseau
wit
would
my
lips
were
there
how
you
laughed
and
blushed
i
here
the
stream
the
west
has
narrowed
to
a
streak
of
gold
deep
there
a
skiff
let
row
the
skiff
she
speaks
waters
flowing
dark
and
bright
in
the
sunlight
or
the
moon
seize
my
soul
with
such
delight
as
a
visible
music
might
as
some
slow
majestic
tune
made
material
to
the
sight
blossoms
colored
like
the
skies
and
tame
or
wild
fill
my
soul
with
such
surmise
as
the
mind
might
realize
if
our
thoughts
all
undefiled
should
take
form
before
our
eyes
so
to
me
do
these
appeal
so
they
sway
me
every
hour
letting
all
their
beauty
steal
on
my
soul
to
make
it
feel
through
a
rivulet
or
flower
more
than
any
words
reveal
speaks
see
sweetheart
how
the
lilies
lay
their
lambent
leaves
about
our
way
or
nod
and
float
their
flowers
around
our
the
middle
of
the
stream
we
reached
three
strokes
from
where
our
boat
was
beached
look
up
you
scarce
can
see
the
sky
through
trees
that
lean
dark
deep
and
high
and
coiled
with
grape
and
trailing
vine
build
a
vast
roof
of
shade
and
shine
a
house
of
leaves
where
shadows
walk
and
whispering
winds
and
waters
talk
there
is
no
path
the
saplings
choke
the
trunks
they
spring
from
there
an
oak
lies
rotting
and
that
sycamore
which
lays
its
bulk
from
shore
to
shore
uprooted
by
the
floods
perchance
may
be
the
bridge
to
some
romance
now
opening
through
a
willow
fringe
the
waters
creep
one
tawny
tinge
of
sunset
and
on
either
marge
the
cottonwoods
make
walls
of
shade
and
near
the
gradual
hills
loom
large
within
its
mirror
herons
wade
or
fly
like
faery
birds
from
grass
that
mats
the
shore
by
which
we
pass
on
we
pass
we
rippling
pass
on
sunset
waters
still
as
glass
a
flies
above
soft
twittering
to
its
woodland
love
a
whippoorwill
now
calls
afar
and
the
west
like
some
swift
star
a
glittering
jay
flies
screaming
slim
the
and
skim
before
us
and
some
evening
thrush
who
may
discover
where
such
sing
the
silence
rinses
with
a
gush
of
mellow
music
bubbling
on
we
now
let
us
oar
to
yonder
strip
of
ragged
shore
where
from
a
rock
with
lichens
hoar
a
ferny
spring
wells
gliding
by
the
firefly
lights
its
pale
lamp
where
mallows
gloom
and
and
some
hunter
there
within
the
woods
last
fall
encamped
those
ashes
say
and
campfire
the
solitudes
grow
dreamy
with
the
death
of
day
over
the
fields
of
millet
a
young
bird
tries
its
wings
and
sweet
as
a
woodland
rillet
its
first
wild
music
rings
soul
of
my
soul
where
the
meadows
roll
what
is
the
song
it
sings
love
and
a
glad
heart
where
the
rapture
is
adieu
to
sorrow
here
is
the
road
to
bliss
where
all
day
long
you
may
hearken
my
song
and
kiss
kiss
kiss
over
the
fields
of
clover
where
the
wild
bee
drones
and
sways
the
wind
like
a
shepherd
lover
flutes
on
the
fragrant
ways
heart
of
my
heart
where
the
blossoms
part
what
is
the
air
he
plays
love
and
a
song
to
follow
soul
with
the
face
come
follow
come
follow
hill
and
hollow
to
the
land
o
the
bloom
and
beam
where
under
the
flowers
you
may
listen
for
hours
and
dream
dream
dream
speaks
letting
the
boat
here
the
shores
are
irised
grasses
clump
the
water
dark
that
glasses
broken
wood
and
deepened
distance
far
the
musical
persistence
of
a
lingers
low
in
the
west
where
tulips
blow
white
before
us
flames
one
pointed
star
and
day
hath
night
anointed
king
from
out
her
azure
ewer
pouring
starry
fire
truer
than
pure
gold
he
stands
with
the
in
his
hands
will
the
moon
bleach
through
the
ragged
ere
we
reach
yon
jagged
rock
that
rises
gradually
pharos
of
our
homeward
valley
all
the
west
is
smouldering
red
embers
are
the
stars
at
my
soul
some
protean
elf
is
you
simaetha
i
am
delphis
you
are
sappho
and
your
phaon
we
there
lies
a
ray
on
all
the
dark
æolian
seas
the
violet
lesbian
leas
on
we
drift
i
love
you
nearer
looms
our
island
rosier
clearer
the
leucadian
cliff
we
follow
where
the
temple
of
apollo
shines
a
pale
and
pillared
fire
strike
oh
strike
the
lydian
lyre
while
in
hellas
still
we
seem
let
us
sing
of
that
we
dream
he
night
night
is
night
the
moon
drifts
low
above
us
and
all
its
gold
is
tangled
in
the
stream
love
love
my
love
and
all
the
stars
that
love
us
the
stars
smile
down
and
every
star
a
dream
in
odorous
purple
where
the
falling
warble
of
water
cascades
and
the
plunged
foam
glows
a
columned
ruin
lifts
its
sculptured
marble
friezed
with
the
chiselled
rebeck
and
the
rose
sleep
sleep
sweet
sleep
sleeps
at
the
drifting
tiller
and
in
our
sail
the
spirit
of
the
rain
love
love
my
love
ah
bid
thy
heart
be
stiller
and
hark
the
music
of
the
resonant
main
what
flowers
are
those
that
blow
their
balm
unto
us
from
mouths
of
wild
aroma
each
a
flame
that
breathe
of
love
of
love
we
know
that
drew
us
that
kissed
our
eyes
so
we
might
see
the
same
night
night
is
night
no
dream
is
this
to
banish
the
temple
and
the
nightingale
there
our
love
has
made
them
nevermore
to
vanish
real
as
yon
moon
this
in
your
hair
night
night
is
night
and
love
own
star
before
us
its
bright
reflection
in
the
starry
stream
yes
yes
ah
yes
its
presence
shall
watch
us
night
night
and
every
night
we
dream
through
flowers
she
speaks
behold
the
offerings
of
the
common
hills
whose
lowly
names
have
made
them
three
times
dear
the
and
dim
multitudes
of
violets
that
sky
the
mossy
dells
with
heaven
ambrosial
blue
plumes
of
mauve
lobelias
and
the
cups
of
all
along
the
creek
where
lulled
the
freckled
silence
sleeps
and
vague
the
water
flows
where
at
high
noon
the
cows
wade
and
the
heat
is
honied
with
the
drone
of
drowsy
bees
the
blue
streaked
with
crystal
like
a
summer
day
the
and
the
all
frailly
scented
and
familiar
as
fair
baby
faces
and
soft
infant
eyes
simple
suggestions
of
a
life
most
fair
you
whisper
me
of
love
and
untaught
faith
whose
habitation
is
within
the
soul
not
of
the
earth
yet
for
the
earth
indeed
what
is
it
halcyons
my
heart
makes
calm
with
calmness
not
of
wisdom
all
my
soul
love
or
faith
or
both
the
lore
of
all
the
world
is
less
than
these
simple
suggestions
of
a
life
most
fair
and
love
most
sweet
that
i
have
learned
to
know
speaks
yes
i
have
known
its
being
so
long
ago
was
i
seeing
so
beckoning
on
to
a
fairer
land
out
of
the
flowers
it
waved
its
hand
bidding
me
on
to
life
and
love
life
with
the
hope
of
the
love
thereof
what
is
the
value
of
knowing
it
if
you
are
shy
in
showing
it
need
of
the
earth
unfolds
the
flower
dewy
sweet
at
the
proper
hour
and
in
the
world
of
the
human
heart
love
is
the
flower
counterpart
so
when
the
soul
is
heedable
then
is
the
heart
made
readable
i
in
the
book
of
your
heart
have
read
words
that
are
truer
than
truth
has
said
measures
of
love
the
spirit
song
writ
of
your
soul
to
haunt
me
long
love
can
hear
each
laudable
thought
of
the
loved
made
audible
spoken
in
wonder
or
bliss
or
pain
and
it
back
again
ever
responsive
ever
awake
ever
replying
with
ache
for
ache
speaks
earth
gives
its
flowers
to
us
and
heaven
its
stars
indeed
these
are
as
lips
that
woo
us
those
are
as
lights
that
lead
with
love
that
doth
pursue
us
with
hope
that
still
doth
speed
yet
shall
the
flowers
lie
riven
and
lips
forget
to
kiss
the
stars
fade
out
of
heaven
and
lights
lead
us
amiss
as
love
for
which
we
striven
as
hope
that
promises
laughs
wishing
to
dispel
her
seriousness
if
love
i
have
had
of
you
you
had
of
me
then
doubtless
our
loving
were
over
one
would
be
less
than
the
other
you
see
since
what
you
returned
to
your
lover
were
only
his
own
and
interrupts
him
speaking
impetuously
but
if
i
lose
you
if
you
part
with
me
i
will
not
love
you
less
loving
so
much
now
if
there
is
to
be
a
parting
and
distress
what
will
avail
to
comfort
or
reprieve
the
soul
that
anguished
most
the
knowledge
that
it
once
possessed
perceive
the
love
that
it
has
lost
you
must
acknowledge
under
sun
and
moon
all
that
we
feel
is
old
let
morning
flutter
from
night
brown
cocoon
wide
wings
of
flaxen
gold
the
moon
split
through
the
darkness
soaring
like
some
great
moth
and
white
these
have
been
seen
a
myriad
times
before
and
with
the
same
so
is
with
love
how
old
yet
new
it
is
this
only
should
we
heed
to
once
have
known
to
once
have
felt
love
bliss
is
to
be
rich
whether
we
win
or
lose
we
lose
or
win
within
our
gain
or
loss
some
purpose
lies
some
end
unseen
of
sin
beyond
our
crown
or
cross
home
he
true
true
perhaps
it
would
be
best
to
be
that
star
within
the
west
above
the
earth
within
the
skies
yet
shining
in
your
own
blue
eyes
or
haply
better
here
to
blow
a
flower
beneath
your
window
low
that
brief
of
life
and
frail
and
fair
finds
yet
a
heaven
in
your
hair
or
well
perhaps
to
be
the
breeze
that
sighs
its
soul
out
to
the
trees
a
voice
a
breath
of
rain
or
drouth
that
has
its
wild
will
with
your
mouth
these
thing
i
long
to
be
i
long
to
be
the
burthen
of
some
song
you
love
to
sing
a
melody
sure
of
sweet
immortality
the
gate
she
sunday
shall
we
ride
together
not
the
rambling
way
through
the
wood
we
went
that
day
in
last
summer
sultry
weather
past
the
methodist
where
religion
helped
the
hymn
gather
volume
and
a
slim
minister
with
textful
greeting
welcomed
us
and
still
from
the
service
on
the
hill
we
had
gone
three
hills
and
still
very
near
the
singing
sounded
nor
that
road
through
weed
and
berry
drowsy
days
led
me
and
you
to
the
barbecue
where
the
made
merry
dusty
vehicles
together
darkies
with
the
horses
near
tied
to
trees
the
atmosphere
redolent
of
bark
and
leather
as
we
went
the
homeward
journey
you
exclaimed
they
intermix
pleasure
there
with
politics
it
reminds
me
of
a
tourney
and
the
fiddles
through
the
thickets
how
the
wind
brought
from
the
hill
remnants
of
the
old
quadrille
it
was
like
the
drone
of
crickets
neither
road
the
shady
quiet
of
that
path
by
beech
and
birch
winding
to
the
ruined
church
near
the
stream
that
sparkles
by
it
where
the
silent
sundays
listen
for
the
preacher
love
we
bring
in
our
hearts
to
preach
and
sing
shade
to
sabbath
glisten
at
parting
yes
early
when
the
house
of
day
uncloses
portals
that
the
stars
adorn
whence
light
golden
presence
throws
his
fiery
lilies
burning
roses
on
the
world
how
good
to
ride
with
one
sweetheart
at
one
side
so
we
will
ride
to
the
wood
cathedral
places
where
the
wildflowers
hide
sweet
religion
in
their
faces
where
in
truest
untaught
phrases
worship
in
each
rhythmic
word
god
is
praised
by
many
a
bird
look
above
pearly
white
star
on
star
now
crystallizes
out
of
darkness
and
the
night
hangs
them
round
her
like
devices
of
strange
jewels
vapour
rises
glimmering
from
each
wood
and
dell
till
then
farewell
part
iii
late
summer
lightning
flickers
in
one
cloud
as
in
a
a
firefly
some
that
the
bowed
jar
through
the
leaves
and
dimly
lie
among
the
trees
now
low
now
loud
the
whispering
breezes
sigh
the
place
is
lone
the
night
is
hushed
upon
the
path
a
rose
lies
he
strolls
among
the
quiet
lanes
by
farm
and
now
rests
the
season
in
forgetfulness
careless
in
beauty
of
maturity
the
ripened
roses
brown
temples
she
fulfils
completion
in
a
dreamy
guess
now
time
grants
night
the
more
and
day
the
less
the
gray
decides
and
brown
dim
golds
and
drabs
in
dulling
green
express
themselves
and
redden
as
the
year
goes
down
sadder
the
fields
where
thrusting
hoary
high
their
tasseled
heads
the
die
and
pumpkins
deeper
to
tenderness
sadder
the
blue
of
hills
that
lounge
along
the
lonesome
west
sadder
the
song
of
the
wild
in
the
leafage
deeper
and
dreamier
ay
than
woods
or
waters
leans
the
languid
sky
above
lone
orchards
where
the
drips
and
the
russets
mellow
nature
grows
liberal
from
the
beechen
leaves
the
burs
their
little
pockets
thrust
bulged
with
the
copper
of
the
nuts
that
rust
above
the
grass
the
spendthrift
spider
weaves
a
web
of
silver
for
which
dawn
designs
thrice
twenty
rows
of
pearls
beneath
the
oak
that
rolls
old
roots
in
many
gnarly
lines
the
polished
acorns
from
their
saucers
broke
strew
wildwood
on
sonorous
pines
the
far
wind
organs
but
the
forest
near
is
silent
and
the
smoke
of
burning
brush
beyond
that
field
of
hay
hangs
like
a
pillar
in
the
atmosphere
but
now
it
shakes
it
breaks
and
all
the
vines
and
tremble
see
the
wind
is
here
billowing
and
boisterous
and
the
smiling
day
rejoices
with
its
clamor
earth
and
sky
resound
with
glory
of
its
majesty
impetuous
splendor
of
its
rushing
but
on
those
heights
the
forest
yet
is
still
expectant
of
its
coming
far
away
each
anxious
tree
upon
each
waiting
hill
tingles
anticipation
as
in
gray
surmise
of
rapture
now
the
first
gusts
play
like
little
laughs
about
their
rippling
spines
and
now
the
wildwood
one
exultant
sway
shouts
and
the
light
at
each
tumultuous
pause
the
light
that
glooms
and
shines
seems
hands
in
wild
applause
how
glows
that
garden
though
the
white
mists
keep
the
vagabonding
flowers
reminded
of
decay
that
comes
to
slay
in
open
love
when
the
full
moon
hangs
cold
and
night
is
deep
unheeding
still
their
happy
colors
leap
and
laugh
encircled
of
the
scythe
of
death
like
lovely
children
he
prepares
to
reap
staying
his
blade
a
breath
to
mark
their
beauty
ere
with
one
last
sweep
he
lays
them
dead
and
turns
away
to
let
me
admire
ere
yet
the
sickle
of
the
coming
cold
has
mown
them
down
their
beauties
manifold
how
like
to
spurts
of
fire
that
scarlet
salvia
lifts
its
blooms
which
heap
yon
space
of
sunlight
and
as
sparkles
creep
through
charring
parchment
up
that
window
screen
the
cypress
dots
with
crimson
all
its
green
the
haunt
of
many
bees
and
showering
down
cascaded
lattices
that
nightshade
bleeds
with
berries
drops
of
blood
in
clusters
hanging
the
blue
there
in
the
garden
old
the
clumps
of
zinnias
unfold
their
formal
flowers
and
the
marigold
lifts
its
pinched
shred
of
orange
sunset
caught
and
elfed
in
petals
the
nasturtium
all
pungent
leaved
and
bitter
of
perfume
hangs
up
its
goblin
bonnet
fairy
bought
from
gnomeland
there
predominant
red
and
arrogant
the
dahlia
lifts
its
head
beside
the
balsam
rosy
horns
of
honey
within
the
murmuring
sunny
dry
wildness
of
the
weedy
flower
bed
where
crickets
and
the
noon
and
night
sing
dirges
for
the
flowers
that
soon
will
die
for
flowers
already
i
seem
to
hear
the
passing
summer
sigh
a
voice
that
seems
to
weep
too
soon
too
soon
the
beautiful
passes
by
if
i
perchance
might
peep
beneath
those
leaves
of
podded
hollyhocks
that
the
bland
wind
with
odorous
whispers
rocks
i
might
behold
her
white
and
weary
summer
her
flowers
asleep
her
drowsy
flowers
asleep
the
withered
poppies
knotted
in
her
locks
is
reminded
of
another
day
with
the
hips
were
reddening
on
this
rose
those
haws
were
hung
with
fire
that
day
we
went
this
way
that
goes
up
hills
of
bough
and
brier
this
hooked
thorn
caught
her
gown
and
seemed
imploring
her
to
linger
upon
her
hair
a
streamed
like
some
baptizing
finger
this
so
golden
now
with
yellow
blooms
like
bangles
was
fading
then
but
yonder
bough
the
sumach
plume
entangles
was
like
an
indian
painted
face
and
like
a
squaw
attended
that
bush
in
vague
vermilion
grace
with
beads
of
berries
splendid
and
here
we
turned
to
mount
that
hill
down
which
the
wild
brook
tumbles
and
like
that
day
was
still
and
soft
winds
swayed
the
umbles
of
these
wild
carrots
lawny
gray
and
there
us
an
orchard
stretched
and
in
our
way
dropped
ripened
fruit
before
us
a
muffled
thud
the
pippin
fell
and
at
our
feet
rolled
dusty
a
hornet
clinging
to
its
bell
the
pear
lay
bruised
and
rusty
the
smell
of
pulpy
peach
and
plum
from
which
the
juice
oozed
yellow
around
which
bees
made
sleepy
hum
filled
warm
the
air
and
mellow
and
then
we
came
where
many
hued
the
wet
hung
its
balloons
in
shadows
dewed
for
dawning
offertory
with
bush
and
bramble
far
away
beneath
us
stretched
the
valley
cleft
of
one
creek
as
clear
as
day
that
bickered
musically
the
brown
the
bronze
the
green
the
red
of
weed
and
brier
ran
riot
to
walls
of
woods
whose
vistas
led
to
shadowy
nooks
of
quiet
long
waves
of
feathering
ran
through
the
gray
in
patches
as
in
a
cloud
the
gold
of
god
burns
that
the
sunset
catches
and
there
above
the
blue
hills
rolled
like
some
vast
conflagration
the
sunset
flaming
rose
and
gold
we
watched
in
exultation
then
turning
homeward
she
and
i
went
in
love
sweet
derangement
how
different
now
seem
earth
and
sky
since
this
undreamed
estrangement
enters
the
woods
he
sits
down
here
where
the
day
is
dimmest
and
silence
company
some
might
find
sympathy
for
loss
or
grief
the
grimmest
in
each
tree
here
where
the
day
is
dimmest
but
ah
there
none
for
me
in
leaves
might
find
communion
returning
sigh
for
sigh
for
love
the
heavens
deny
the
love
that
yearns
for
union
yet
parts
and
knows
not
in
leaves
might
find
communion
but
ah
not
i
not
i
my
eyes
with
tears
are
why
has
she
written
me
and
will
no
longer
see
my
heart
with
grief
is
breaking
with
grief
that
this
should
be
my
eyes
with
tears
are
aching
why
has
she
written
me
proceeds
in
the
direction
of
a
better
is
death
than
sleep
better
for
tired
why
do
we
weep
and
weep
when
near
us
the
solace
lies
there
in
that
stream
that
deep
reflecting
woods
and
skies
could
comfort
all
our
sighs
the
mystery
of
things
of
dreams
philosophies
which
the
mortal
clings
can
unriddle
what
the
water
sings
what
it
promises
end
to
all
miseries
seats
himself
on
a
rock
and
gazes
steadily
into
the
and
here
alone
i
sit
and
it
is
so
o
vales
and
hills
o
valley
lands
and
knobs
what
cure
have
you
for
woe
none
that
my
heart
may
know
the
wearying
sameness
yet
this
thing
is
so
this
thing
is
so
and
still
the
waters
flow
the
leaves
drop
slowly
down
the
daylight
throbs
with
sun
and
wind
and
yet
this
thing
is
so
here
at
this
culvert
mouth
the
shadowy
water
flowing
towards
the
south
seems
deepest
what
is
there
yonder
that
makes
me
afraid
of
my
own
self
afraid
what
below
what
power
draws
me
to
the
striate
stream
what
evil
or
what
dream
me
dropping
pebbles
in
the
quiet
wave
that
echoes
strange
as
music
in
a
cave
hollow
and
thin
vibrating
in
the
shade
like
sound
of
tears
the
shadow
of
some
woe
an
ailing
phantom
that
will
not
be
laid
since
this
is
so
since
this
sad
thing
is
so
there
in
the
water
how
the
lank
green
grass
mats
its
rank
blades
each
blade
a
crooked
kris
making
a
marsh
which
the
currents
miss
their
melodies
but
there
and
there
one
sees
the
mallow
as
within
a
glass
leaning
the
shore
as
if
its
own
pink
image
it
would
kiss
and
there
the
tangled
vine
lifts
conical
blossoms
each
a
cup
of
wine
as
pale
as
moonlight
is
and
there
tall
gipsy
lilies
all
their
savage
coppery
faces
fierce
of
hue
dull
bend
in
inverted
and
where
the
stream
around
those
rushes
creeps
the
in
endless
error
keeps
sewing
the
pale
gold
gown
of
day
with
tangled
stitches
of
a
burning
blue
its
brilliant
body
seems
a
needle
fine
a
thread
of
azure
ray
but
here
below
me
where
my
pensive
shade
looks
up
at
me
the
stale
stream
stagnant
lies
deep
dark
but
clear
and
silent
save
the
hiss
of
bursting
bubbles
in
the
spawny
all
flowers
here
refuse
to
grow
or
blossom
beauties
too
are
few
that
haunt
its
depths
no
glittering
minnows
braid
its
languid
crystal
and
no
gravels
strew
with
colored
orbs
its
bottom
half
afraid
i
shrink
from
my
own
eyes
there
in
its
cairngorm
skies
i
know
not
why
and
yet
it
seems
is
this
i
know
not
what
but
where
the
kildees
wade
slim
in
the
foamy
scum
from
that
direction
hither
doth
it
come
and
makes
my
heart
afraid
nearer
it
draws
to
where
those
low
rocks
ail
warm
rocks
on
which
some
hath
clomb
to
bask
its
spotted
body
coiling
at
first
it
seemed
a
prism
on
the
grail
a
bubble
prism
yonder
then
a
trail
an
angled
sparkle
in
a
shadow
swayed
through
deeps
to
crouch
a
flaccid
pale
squat
bulk
below
reflected
trees
and
skies
and
clouds
that
lounge
at
sunny
loss
seem
in
its
stolid
eyes
deep
down
the
dim
disguise
of
something
ghoulish
there
whose
features
fail
then
come
again
in
rhythmic
waviness
with
arms
like
tentacles
that
seem
to
press
up
towards
me
limbs
that
writhe
and
fade
and
clench
tough
limbs
that
twist
and
cross
through
flabby
hair
like
smoky
moss
how
horrible
to
see
this
thing
at
night
or
when
the
sunset
slants
its
brimstone
light
above
the
water
when
in
phantom
flight
the
perhaps
above
it
reel
then
haply
would
it
rise
a
rotting
green
up
up
and
gather
me
with
arms
of
steel
soft
steel
and
drag
me
where
the
wave
is
white
beneath
that
boulder
there
that
plants
a
keel
against
the
ripple
there
a
shoulder
no
no
i
must
away
before
is
night
before
the
dot
the
dusk
with
sulphur
blurrings
bright
before
upon
yon
height
the
white
vanish
from
the
sight
and
boneset
blossoms
tossing
there
in
clusters
fade
to
a
ridge
a
streak
of
ghostly
lustres
and
in
yon
sunlit
spot
that
cedar
tree
is
not
but
a
huge
cap
instead
that
some
giant
dropped
while
driving
home
his
sheep
and
those
fallow
browns
and
russet
grays
the
fragrant
peak
of
yonder
timothy
stack
is
not
a
stack
but
something
hideous
black
that
threatens
and
grotesquely
demon
frowns
i
must
away
from
already
dusk
draws
near
the
owlet
dolorous
hoot
sounds
quavering
as
a
gnome
wild
flute
the
toad
within
the
wet
begins
to
tune
its
goblin
flageolet
the
slow
sun
sinks
behind
those
hills
and
like
a
withered
cheek
distorted
there
the
spectral
moon
defined
above
those
trees
above
that
mass
of
vines
that
like
a
wrecked
appentice
roofs
those
oh
i
am
faint
and
i
must
away
away
before
the
close
of
day
already
at
my
back
i
feel
the
woods
grow
black
and
sense
the
evening
wind
guttural
and
gaunt
and
blind
snarling
behind
me
like
a
when
will
it
cease
to
pierce
this
anguish
dull
and
fierce
at
heart
and
soul
when
will
it
let
me
go
at
last
with
footsteps
slow
with
half
averted
cheek
i
reached
this
woodland
creek
far
from
that
place
of
fear
and
still
i
seem
to
hear
a
dripping
footstep
near
a
gurgling
voice
dim
glimmering
at
my
ear
i
try
to
fly
i
can
not
yes
and
no
what
horror
holds
me
god
that
obscene
slow
sure
mastering
chimera
there
has
yet
some
horrible
feeler
round
my
neck
or
in
my
scattered
hair
off
off
thou
devil
coil
the
waters
thrashing
boil
once
more
i
free
once
more
i
free
glad
of
that
firefly
fleck
that
like
a
lamp
of
golden
fairy
oil
lights
me
the
way
i
no
more
i
stare
nor
reck
nor
little
care
to
foil
the
madness
there
the
murder
there
that
slips
back
to
its
lair
of
slime
that
seeps
and
drips
that
sought
in
vain
to
fasten
on
my
lips
a
letter
from
his
pocket
he
hurries
what
can
it
mean
for
me
what
have
i
done
to
her
i
in
our
season
of
love
as
a
sun
to
her
she
all
its
heaven
of
silvery
numberful
stars
and
its
moon
shining
golden
and
slumberful
who
on
my
life
that
was
thorny
and
lowery
gazed
and
made
beautiful
smiled
and
made
flowery
she
to
my
heart
and
my
soul
a
divinity
she
who
i
dreamed
seemed
my
spirit
affinity
what
have
i
done
to
her
what
have
i
done
what
can
she
mean
by
this
what
have
i
said
to
her
i
who
have
idolized
worshipped
and
pled
to
her
sung
for
her
laughed
for
her
sorrowed
and
sighed
for
her
lived
for
her
only
would
gladly
have
died
for
her
see
she
has
written
me
thus
she
has
written
me
sooner
would
dagger
or
serpent
had
smitten
me
would
you
had
shriveled
ere
ever
you
read
of
it
eyes
that
are
wide
to
the
bitterest
dread
of
it
what
have
i
said
to
her
what
have
i
said
what
shall
i
make
of
it
i
who
am
trembling
dreading
to
lose
a
moth
the
dissembling
flame
of
the
candle
attracts
with
its
guttering
flattering
on
till
its
body
lies
fluttering
scorched
in
the
summer
foolish
importunate
why
thou
leave
the
cool
flowers
unfortunate
such
has
she
been
to
me
making
me
such
to
her
slaying
me
saying
i
never
was
much
to
her
what
shall
i
make
of
it
what
can
i
make
love
in
thy
everglades
moaning
and
motionless
look
i
have
fallen
the
evil
is
potionless
i
with
no
thought
but
the
that
did
lock
us
in
set
naked
feet
the
cottonmouth
moccasin
under
the
roses
the
cherokee
eyeing
i
in
the
sky
with
the
egrets
that
flying
me
loosened
like
blooms
from
magnolias
rose
slenderly
white
and
pale
pink
where
the
tenderly
sang
making
vistas
of
mosses
melodious
wandered
unheeding
my
steps
in
the
odious
ooze
and
the
venom
i
followed
the
wiry
violet
curve
of
thy
star
falling
fiery
so
was
i
lost
in
night
thus
am
undone
have
i
not
told
to
her
living
alone
for
her
purposed
unfoldments
of
deeds
i
had
sown
for
her
here
in
the
soil
of
my
soul
their
variety
endless
and
ever
she
answered
with
piety
see
it
has
come
to
this
all
the
tale
suavity
at
the
ninth
chapter
grows
wretched
to
gravity
cruel
as
death
all
our
beautiful
history
close
it
the
finis
is
more
than
a
yes
i
will
go
to
her
yes
i
will
speak
the
last
meeting
the
day
i
seem
to
see
her
still
to
see
that
dim
blue
room
her
perfume
comes
from
lavender
folds
draped
dreamily
one
blossom
of
brocaded
blooms
some
stuff
of
orient
looms
i
seem
to
hear
her
speak
and
back
where
lies
the
sun
on
books
and
piles
of
porcelain
and
a
tall
clock
ticks
above
the
tiles
where
love
framed
profile
smiles
i
hear
her
say
ah
had
i
known
i
suffer
too
for
what
has
been
for
what
must
be
a
wild
ache
shone
in
her
sad
eyes
that
seemed
to
lean
on
something
far
unseen
and
as
in
sleep
my
own
self
seems
outside
my
suffering
i
flush
facts
and
undetermined
dreams
and
wait
as
silent
as
that
hush
of
lilac
light
and
plush
smiling
but
suffering
i
feel
beneath
that
face
so
sweet
and
sad
in
those
pale
temples
thoughts
like
steel
pierce
i
had
gone
mad
had
i
once
deemed
her
unconsciously
with
eyes
that
yearn
to
look
beyond
the
present
far
for
some
faint
future
hope
i
turn
above
her
garden
day
fierce
star
vermilion
at
the
window
bar
sank
sullenly
like
love
own
sun
an
omen
of
our
future
and
then
the
memory
of
one
rich
day
she
said
she
be
my
wife
set
heart
and
brain
at
strife
again
amid
the
heavy
hues
soft
crimson
seal
and
satiny
gold
of
flowers
there
i
stood
dews
with
her
deep
in
her
garden
old
while
sunset
fires
uprolled
and
now
it
can
not
be
and
yet
to
feel
is
so
in
heart
and
brain
to
know
is
so
while
warm
and
wet
i
seem
to
smell
those
scents
again
and
rain
i
turn
in
hope
she
bid
me
stay
again
her
cameo
beauty
mark
set
in
that
she
turns
away
no
word
of
love
not
even
a
spark
of
hope
to
cheer
the
dark
that
sepia
sketch
conceive
it
so
a
jaunty
head
with
mouth
and
eyes
tragic
beneath
a
unmasking
it
denies
the
look
we
half
surmise
we
know
is
there
is
thus
we
read
the
true
beneath
the
false
perceive
the
smile
that
hides
the
indeed
whose
soul
unmasks
not
mine
i
grieve
oh
god
but
laugh
and
leave
walks
aimlessly
beyond
those
twisted
that
partly
hide
the
old
its
tattered
arms
and
tattered
knees
a
tosses
to
the
breeze
among
the
shocks
of
corn
my
heart
is
gray
as
is
the
day
in
which
the
drearily
makes
all
the
sounding
branches
sway
and
in
the
hollows
far
away
the
dry
leaves
rustle
wearily
and
soon
we
hear
the
far
honk
in
heavens
under
arcturus
when
my
walks
must
cease
and
by
the
fireside
peace
i
sit
and
nod
and
when
every
fall
of
this
loud
creek
is
architectured
ice
and
hinted
brown
acres
of
yon
corn
stretch
bleak
with
the
snows
that
streak
the
hillsides
i
sit
and
dream
of
that
glad
morn
we
went
down
ways
where
blooms
were
blowing
that
dusk
we
strolled
through
flower
and
thorn
by
tasseled
meads
of
cane
and
corn
to
where
the
stream
was
flowing
again
i
oar
our
boat
among
the
that
dot
the
river
and
reach
her
hat
the
long
strikes
in
the
stream
we
sing
that
song
and
then
i
wake
and
shiver
why
is
it
that
my
mind
reverts
to
that
sweet
past
while
full
of
parting
the
present
is
so
full
of
hurts
and
heartache
that
what
it
asserts
adds
only
to
the
smarting
how
often
shall
i
sit
and
think
of
that
sweet
past
through
lowered
lashes
trace
link
by
link
then
watch
it
gradually
sink
and
crumble
into
ashes
outside
i
hear
the
sad
wind
weep
like
some
lone
spirit
grieved
forsaken
then
shuddering
to
bed
shall
creep
and
lie
awake
or
haply
sleep
a
sleep
by
visions
shaken
dreams
of
the
past
that
paint
and
draw
the
present
in
a
hue
that
wanting
a
thing
of
sticks
and
straw
like
that
just
now
i
passing
saw
its
empty
tatters
flaunting
compares
the
present
day
with
a
past
the
sun
a
splintered
splendor
was
in
trees
whose
waving
branches
blurred
its
disc
that
day
we
went
together
hum
and
whirring
buzz
of
insects
through
the
fields
that
purred
with
summer
in
the
perfect
weather
so
sweet
it
was
to
look
and
lean
to
her
young
face
and
feel
the
light
of
eyes
that
met
my
own
unsaddened
her
laugh
that
left
lips
more
serene
her
speech
that
blossomed
like
the
white
there
and
gladdened
maturing
summer
you
were
fraught
with
more
of
beauty
then
than
now
parades
the
pageant
of
september
where
contrasts
in
thought
with
that
bloom
and
bough
can
only
help
me
to
remember
pauses
before
a
deserted
house
by
the
through
and
roses
and
ancient
beech
and
oak
old
porches
it
discloses
above
the
weeds
and
roses
the
drizzling
raindrops
soak
neglected
walks
with
grass
and
every
mildewed
angle
heaped
with
dead
leaves
that
spangle
the
paths
that
round
it
pass
the
creatures
there
that
bury
and
hide
within
its
rooms
and
spidered
closets
very
dim
with
gray
webs
will
hurry
out
when
the
twilight
glooms
owls
roost
in
room
and
basement
bats
haunt
its
hearth
and
porch
and
through
some
paneless
casement
flit
in
the
moon
enlacement
or
firefly
twinkling
torch
there
is
a
sense
of
frost
here
and
gusts
that
sigh
what
was
it
that
was
lost
here
long
long
ago
was
lost
here
can
anybody
say
my
foot
perhaps
would
startle
some
bird
that
mopes
within
some
owl
above
its
portal
that
stares
upon
the
mortal
as
on
a
thing
of
sin
the
rutty
road
winds
by
it
this
side
the
dusty
why
do
i
stop
to
eye
it
my
heart
can
not
deny
it
the
house
is
like
my
soul
proceeds
on
his
i
bear
a
burden
look
not
therein
naught
will
you
find
but
sorrow
and
sin
sorrow
and
sin
that
wend
with
me
wherever
i
go
and
misery
a
gaunt
companion
a
wretched
bride
goes
always
with
me
side
by
side
sick
of
myself
and
all
the
earth
i
ask
my
soul
now
is
life
worth
the
little
pleasure
that
we
gain
for
all
our
sorrow
and
our
pain
the
love
to
which
we
gave
our
best
that
turns
a
mockery
and
a
jest
the
twilight
the
things
we
love
the
loveliest
things
we
cherish
pass
from
us
soonest
vanish
utterly
dust
are
our
deeds
and
dust
our
dreams
that
perish
ere
we
can
say
i
have
loved
man
and
learned
we
are
not
brothers
within
myself
perhaps
may
lie
the
cause
then
set
one
woman
high
above
all
others
and
found
her
full
of
flaws
made
unseen
stars
my
keblahs
of
devotion
aspired
to
knowledge
and
remained
a
clod
with
heart
and
soul
led
on
by
blind
emotion
the
way
to
failure
trod
chance
say
or
fate
that
works
through
good
and
evil
or
destiny
that
nothing
may
retard
that
to
some
end
above
life
empty
level
perhaps
withholds
reward
part
iv
late
autumn
who
die
young
are
should
we
not
envy
such
they
are
earth
happiest
and
favored
much
they
who
die
young
are
and
sad
propped
among
pillows
she
sits
at
her
the
violet
come
with
april
showers
and
the
music
hum
about
the
flowers
we
shall
never
wend
as
when
love
laughed
leading
us
from
men
over
violet
vale
and
glen
where
the
piped
for
hours
and
we
heard
the
drum
now
november
heavens
are
gray
autumn
kills
every
joy
like
leaves
of
may
in
the
still
i
sit
and
lean
and
listen
to
a
voice
that
has
arisen
in
my
heart
with
eyes
that
glisten
looking
at
the
happy
hills
fading
far
away
gazes
out
upon
the
dying
there
rank
death
clutches
at
the
flowers
and
drags
them
down
and
stamps
in
earth
at
morn
the
thin
malignant
hours
among
the
windy
bowers
clamor
a
bitter
or
is
it
that
forlorn
would
so
conceal
itself
in
scorn
at
noon
the
weak
white
sunlight
crawls
like
feeble
feet
once
beautiful
from
mildewed
walks
to
mildewed
walls
down
which
the
oozing
moisture
falls
upon
the
cold
faint
on
the
leaves
it
drips
and
creeps
or
is
it
tears
of
one
who
weeps
at
night
a
misty
blur
of
moon
slips
through
the
trees
pale
as
a
face
of
melancholy
marble
hewn
and
like
the
phantom
of
some
tune
winds
whisper
in
the
or
is
it
love
come
back
again
seeking
its
perished
joy
in
vain
muses
upon
the
when
in
her
cloudy
chiton
spring
freed
the
frozen
rills
and
walked
in
rainbowed
light
on
the
forests
fields
and
hills
beyond
the
world
horizon
that
no
such
glory
lies
on
and
no
such
hues
bedizen
love
led
us
far
from
ills
when
summer
came
a
sickle
stuck
in
her
sheaf
of
gleams
and
let
the
honey
trickle
from
out
the
beehives
seams
within
the
sweet
book
to
us
alloted
whose
lines
are
starry
dotted
love
read
us
still
his
dreams
then
autumn
came
a
liar
a
heretic
in
gypsy
garb
of
fire
throned
on
a
harvest
our
lives
that
fate
had
thwarted
stood
pale
and
broken
hearted
though
smiling
when
we
parted
where
love
to
death
lay
sick
now
is
the
winter
waited
the
tyrant
hoar
and
old
with
death
and
hunger
mated
who
counts
his
crimes
like
once
more
before
forever
we
part
once
more
then
never
once
more
before
we
sever
must
i
his
face
behold
takes
up
a
book
and
what
little
things
are
those
that
hold
our
happiness
a
smile
a
glance
a
rose
dropped
from
her
hair
or
dress
a
word
a
look
a
touch
these
are
so
much
so
much
an
air
we
ca
forget
a
sunset
gold
that
gleams
a
spray
of
migonette
will
fill
the
soul
with
dreams
more
than
all
history
says
or
romance
of
old
days
for
of
the
human
heart
not
brain
is
memory
these
things
it
makes
a
part
of
its
own
entity
the
joys
the
pains
whereof
are
the
very
food
of
love
lays
down
the
how
true
how
true
but
words
are
weak
in
sympathy
they
give
the
soul
to
music
music
that
can
speak
all
the
heart
pain
and
dole
still
making
us
remember
most
the
love
we
lost
the
love
we
lost
so
weary
am
i
and
so
fain
to
see
his
face
to
feel
his
kiss
thrill
rapture
through
my
soul
again
there
is
no
hell
like
ah
god
my
god
were
it
not
best
to
give
me
rest
to
give
me
rest
writes
to
him
to
come
to
dead
lie
the
dreams
we
cherished
the
dreams
we
loved
so
well
like
forest
leaves
they
perished
like
autumn
leaves
they
fell
alas
that
dreams
so
soon
should
pass
alas
alas
the
stream
lies
bleak
and
arid
that
once
went
singing
on
the
flowers
once
that
varied
its
banks
are
dead
and
gone
where
these
were
once
are
thorns
and
thirst
the
place
is
curst
come
to
me
i
am
lonely
forgive
what
you
have
come
to
me
if
for
only
one
last
sad
parting
word
for
one
last
word
before
the
pall
falls
over
all
the
day
and
hour
are
suited
for
what
i
say
to
you
of
love
that
i
uprooted
but
i
have
suffered
too
come
to
me
i
would
say
before
i
die
wind
rises
the
trees
are
woods
that
beat
the
wind
with
frantic
gestures
and
drop
darkly
acorns
gnarled
and
leaves
that
antic
wildly
on
the
rustling
ground
is
it
tragic
grief
that
saddens
through
your
souls
this
autumn
day
or
the
joy
of
death
that
gladdens
in
exultance
of
decay
arrogant
you
lift
defiant
boughs
against
the
moaning
blast
that
like
some
invisible
giant
wrapped
in
tumult
thunders
past
is
it
that
in
such
insurgent
fury
tossed
from
tree
to
tree
you
would
quench
the
fiercely
urgent
pangs
of
some
old
memory
as
in
toil
and
violent
action
that
still
help
them
to
forget
mortals
drown
the
dark
distraction
and
insistence
of
regret
muses
in
the
gathering
last
night
i
slept
till
midnight
then
woke
and
far
away
a
cock
crowed
lonely
and
distant
came
mournful
a
bay
but
lonelier
sadder
the
tedious
old
clock
ticked
on
towards
day
and
what
a
day
remember
those
morns
of
summer
and
spring
that
bound
our
lives
together
each
morn
a
of
dew
aroma
and
sparkle
and
flowers
and
birds
sweet
morns
when
i
strolled
my
garden
awaiting
him
the
rose
expected
too
with
blushes
the
that
grows
a
bank
of
radiance
and
fragrance
where
the
gate
its
shadow
throws
not
in
vain
did
i
wait
departed
summer
amid
your
phlox
the
powdery
crystal
and
crimson
of
your
hollow
hollyhocks
your
and
poppies
and
the
bee
that
in
them
rocks
the
pendulous
purple
of
the
vine
by
the
of
the
pansies
and
the
snapdragons
in
line
i
waited
and
there
he
met
me
whose
heart
was
one
with
mine
how
warm
was
the
breath
of
the
garden
when
he
met
me
there
that
day
how
the
burnished
beetle
and
butterfly
flew
past
us
each
a
ray
the
memory
of
those
meetings
still
bears
me
far
away
ah
me
when
i
think
of
the
handfuls
of
little
gold
coins
my
scattered
over
the
garden
grass
and
the
marigolds
that
boasted
their
bits
of
burning
brass
more
bitter
i
feel
the
autumn
tighten
spirit
and
heart
and
regret
the
days
remembered
as
lost
that
stand
apart
a
chapter
holy
and
sacred
i
read
with
eyes
that
smart
again
to
the
woods
by
the
watermill
i
steal
where
the
lilies
tumble
together
the
madcap
wind
at
heel
and
meet
him
among
the
blossoms
that
the
rocks
and
the
trees
conceal
or
the
grey
of
the
meadows
that
the
daisies
dot
and
that
tangle
a
tawny
spot
of
languid
leopard
beauty
that
dozes
fierce
and
hot
ah
back
again
with
the
present
with
winds
that
pinch
and
twist
the
leaves
in
their
peevish
passion
and
whirl
wherever
they
list
with
the
autumn
hoary
and
nipping
whose
mausolean
mist
builds
wan
a
tomb
for
the
daylight
each
morning
shaggy
with
fog
that
fits
grey
wigs
to
the
cedars
and
furs
with
frost
each
log
that
carpets
with
pearl
the
meadow
and
marbles
brook
and
bog
alone
at
dawn
indifferent
alone
at
eve
i
sigh
and
wait
like
the
wind
complaining
complain
and
know
not
why
but
ailing
and
longing
and
pining
because
i
do
not
die
how
dull
is
that
sunset
dreary
and
cold
and
hard
and
dead
the
ghost
of
the
one
last
august
that
deeply
rich
and
red
like
the
wine
of
god
own
vintage
poured
purple
overhead
but
now
i
sit
with
the
sighing
dead
dreams
of
a
dying
year
like
the
fallen
leaves
and
the
acorns
am
worthless
and
feel
as
sear
with
a
withered
soul
and
body
whose
heart
is
one
big
tear
as
i
stare
from
my
window
the
daylight
like
a
bravo
its
cloak
puts
on
the
moon
like
a
cautious
lanthorn
glitters
and
then
is
will
he
come
will
he
answer
oh
god
would
it
were
dawn
enters
taking
her
in
his
arms
he
they
said
you
were
dying
you
shall
not
die
why
are
you
crying
why
do
you
sigh
cease
that
sad
sighing
love
it
is
i
all
is
forgiven
love
is
not
poor
though
he
was
driven
once
from
your
door
back
he
has
striven
to
part
nevermore
will
you
remember
what
i
forget
words
each
an
ember
that
you
regret
now
in
november
now
we
have
met
what
if
love
wept
once
what
though
you
knew
what
if
he
crept
once
pleading
to
you
he
never
slept
once
nor
was
untrue
often
forgetful
love
may
forget
froward
and
fretful
dear
he
will
fret
ever
regretful
he
will
regret
life
is
completer
through
his
control
living
made
sweeter
even
through
dole
hearing
love
metre
sing
in
the
soul
flesh
may
not
hear
it
being
impure
and
mind
may
fear
it
may
not
endure
but
in
the
spirit
there
we
are
sure
so
when
ceases
and
we
quit
this
we
borrow
mortality
love
chastens
sorrow
so
it
can
see
still
you
are
weeping
why
do
you
weep
are
tears
in
keeping
with
joy
so
deep
gladness
so
sweeping
are
you
asleep
speak
to
me
dearest
say
it
is
true
that
i
am
nearest
dearest
to
smile
with
those
clearest
eyes
of
grey
blue
smiles
through
her
tears
holding
his
hands
she
they
did
not
say
i
could
not
live
beyond
this
weary
night
but
now
i
know
that
i
shall
die
before
the
morning
light
how
weak
i
am
but
you
forgive
me
when
i
tell
you
how
i
loved
you
love
you
and
the
pain
it
is
to
leave
you
now
we
could
not
marry
see
the
flesh
that
clothes
the
soul
of
me
ordained
at
birth
a
sacrifice
to
this
heredity
denied
ah
you
have
seen
the
bright
spots
in
my
cheeks
flush
hectic
as
before
the
night
the
west
burns
streaks
but
i
promised
you
my
hand
a
thing
forlorn
of
life
diseased
oh
god
and
so
far
better
so
forsworn
oh
i
was
jealous
of
your
love
but
think
if
i
had
died
ere
babe
of
mine
had
come
to
be
a
solace
at
your
side
had
it
been
little
then
your
grief
when
heaven
had
made
us
one
in
everything
that
good
on
earth
and
then
the
good
undone
no
no
and
had
i
had
a
child
what
grief
and
agony
to
know
that
blight
born
in
him
too
against
all
help
of
me
just
when
we
cherish
him
the
most
and
youthful
sunny
pride
sits
on
his
curly
front
to
see
him
die
ere
we
have
whose
fault
ah
god
not
mine
but
his
that
ancestor
who
gave
escutcheon
to
our
humble
house
a
and
a
grave
beneath
the
pomp
of
those
grim
arms
i
live
and
may
not
move
nor
faith
nor
truth
nor
wealth
avail
to
hurl
them
down
nor
love
how
could
i
tell
you
this
not
then
when
all
the
world
was
spun
of
morning
colors
for
our
love
to
walk
and
dance
upon
i
could
not
tell
you
how
disease
hid
here
a
hideous
germ
precedence
slowly
claiming
and
so
slowly
fixing
firm
and
when
i
broke
our
plighted
troth
and
would
not
tell
you
why
i
loved
you
thinking
time
enough
when
i
have
come
to
die
draw
off
my
rings
and
let
my
hands
rest
so
the
wretched
cough
will
interrupt
my
feeble
speech
and
will
not
be
put
off
ah
anyhow
my
anodyne
is
this
to
know
that
you
are
near
me
love
me
kiss
me
now
as
you
were
wont
to
do
and
tell
me
you
forgive
me
all
and
say
you
will
forget
the
sorrow
of
that
the
fever
and
the
now
set
those
roses
near
my
face
and
tell
me
death
a
lie
once
it
was
hard
for
me
to
live
now
it
is
hard
to
die
part
v
winter
whom
god
sets
a
task
striving
who
attain
we
are
the
curst
who
ask
death
and
still
ask
in
vain
we
whom
god
sets
a
the
silence
of
his
room
after
many
all
all
are
shadows
all
must
pass
as
writing
in
the
sand
or
sea
reflections
in
a
are
not
less
permanent
than
we
the
days
that
mould
us
what
are
they
that
break
us
on
their
whirling
wheel
what
but
the
potters
we
the
clay
they
fashion
and
yet
leave
unreal
linked
through
the
ages
one
and
all
in
long
anthropomorphous
chain
the
human
and
the
animal
inseparably
must
remain
within
us
still
the
monster
shape
that
shrieked
in
air
and
howled
in
slime
what
are
we
partly
man
and
ape
the
tools
of
fate
the
toys
of
time
bitterness
of
his
bereavement
speaks
in
vased
in
her
bedroom
window
white
as
her
chaste
girlhood
never
lost
i
smelt
the
roses
and
the
night
outside
was
fog
and
frost
what
though
i
claimed
her
dying
there
god
nor
one
angel
understood
nor
cared
who
from
sweet
feet
to
hair
had
changed
to
snow
her
blood
she
had
been
mine
so
long
so
long
our
harp
of
life
was
one
in
word
why
did
death
thrust
his
hand
among
the
chords
and
break
one
chord
a
placid
lily
was
the
face
a
sad
pale
rose
the
mouth
i
kissed
that
morn
when
filled
with
heaven
own
grace
she
passed
into
the
mist
dead
face
seems
to
rise
up
before
the
face
that
i
said
farewell
to
pillowed
a
flower
on
flowers
comes
back
with
its
eyes
to
tell
to
my
soul
what
its
lips
would
spell
too
comes
back
to
me
at
hours
dear
is
your
heart
still
daggered
there
by
something
amiss
love
is
he
still
a
laggard
hope
is
her
face
still
haggard
tell
me
what
it
is
you
who
are
done
with
done
with
these
worldly
skies
done
with
our
pain
and
sorrow
done
with
the
griefs
we
borrow
prayers
and
tears
and
sighs
must
we
say
gone
forever
or
will
it
all
come
true
shall
i
attain
to
you
ever
and
the
doubts
that
sever
rise
to
the
truth
that
you
love
in
my
flesh
so
fearful
medicine
me
this
pain
love
with
the
eyes
so
tearful
how
can
my
soul
be
cheerful
seeing
its
joy
is
slain
gone
was
only
a
vision
gone
like
a
thought
a
gleam
such
to
our
indecision
utter
no
empty
mission
truer
than
that
they
seem
sinks
into
deep
there
are
shadows
that
compel
us
there
are
voices
that
control
more
than
substance
these
can
tell
us
speaking
to
the
human
soul
in
the
moonlight
when
it
glistened
on
my
window
white
as
snow
once
i
woke
and
leaning
listened
to
a
voice
that
sang
below
full
of
gladness
full
of
yearning
strange
with
dreamy
melody
like
a
bird
whose
heart
is
burning
wildly
sweet
it
sang
to
me
i
arose
and
by
the
starlight
pale
beneath
the
mystic
sky
i
have
seen
it
full
of
far
light
my
dead
joy
go
singing
by
in
the
darkness
when
the
glimmer
of
the
storm
was
on
the
pane
i
have
sat
and
heard
a
dimmer
voice
lamenting
in
the
rain
full
of
parting
and
unspoken
heartbreak
faint
with
agony
like
a
bird
whose
heart
is
broken
sadly
low
it
cried
to
me
i
arose
and
in
the
darkness
wan
beneath
the
haunted
sky
i
have
seen
it
cold
to
starkness
my
dead
love
go
weeping
by
arouses
from
his
so
long
it
seems
since
last
i
saw
her
face
so
long
ago
it
seems
like
some
sad
soul
in
unconjectured
space
still
seeking
happiness
through
perished
grace
and
unrealities
a
little
while
illusions
lead
me
ending
in
the
smile
of
death
triumphant
in
a
thorny
place
among
love
ruined
roses
and
dead
dreams
since
she
is
gone
no
more
i
see
the
light
since
she
has
left
all
dark
cleave
like
a
revelation
through
the
night
i
wander
blindly
filled
with
fear
and
fright
among
the
fragments
and
the
wrecks
and
stones
of
life
where
hope
amid
the
skulls
and
bones
with
weary
face
disheartened
wild
and
white
trims
her
pale
lamp
with
its
expiring
spark
now
she
is
dead
the
soul
naught
can
now
she
has
passed
from
me
questions
god
justice
that
seems
full
of
flaw
as
is
his
world
where
misery
is
law
and
men
but
fools
too
willing
to
be
my
house
of
faith
built
up
on
dust
of
graves
the
wind
of
doubt
sweeps
down
as
made
of
straw
and
all
is
night
and
i
no
longer
see
looks
from
his
window
toward
the
sombre
ridged
and
bleak
the
gray
forsaken
twilight
at
the
night
has
guessed
and
no
star
of
dusk
has
taken
flame
unshaken
in
the
west
all
day
long
the
woodlands
dying
moaned
and
drippings
as
of
grief
tossed
from
barren
boughs
with
sighing
death
of
flying
twig
and
leaf
ah
to
live
a
life
unbroken
scornful
of
the
worst
of
fate
like
that
tree
with
branches
oaken
joy
unspoken
who
can
say
that
man
has
never
lived
the
life
of
plants
and
trees
not
so
wide
the
lines
that
sever
us
forever
here
from
these
colors
odors
that
are
cherished
haply
hint
we
once
were
flowers
memory
alone
has
perished
in
this
garished
world
of
ours
music
that
all
things
expresses
all
for
which
we
loved
or
sinned
haply
in
our
treey
tresses
once
was
guesses
of
the
wind
but
i
dream
the
dusk
upbraiding
deepens
without
moon
or
star
darkness
and
my
sorrow
aiding
we
but
fading
phantoms
are
and
within
me
doubt
keeps
saying
what
is
wrong
and
what
is
right
hear
the
cursing
hear
the
praying
all
are
straying
on
in
night
turns
from
the
window
takes
up
a
book
and
the
soul
like
earth
hath
silences
which
speak
not
yet
are
heard
the
voices
mute
of
memories
are
louder
than
a
word
theirs
is
a
speech
which
is
not
speech
a
language
that
is
bound
to
vague
that
reach
deeper
than
any
sound
no
words
are
theirs
they
speak
through
things
a
visible
utterance
of
thoughts
like
those
some
sunset
brings
or
withered
rose
perchance
the
heavens
that
once
in
purple
and
flame
spake
to
two
hearts
as
one
in
after
years
may
speak
the
same
to
one
sad
heart
alone
through
it
the
vanished
face
and
eyes
of
her
the
sweet
and
fair
of
her
the
lost
again
shall
rise
to
comfort
his
despair
and
so
the
love
that
led
him
long
from
golden
scene
to
scene
within
the
sunset
is
a
tongue
to
tell
him
what
has
how
loud
it
speaks
of
that
dead
day
the
rose
whose
bloom
is
fled
of
her
who
died
who
clasped
in
clay
lies
numbered
with
the
dead
the
dead
are
dead
with
them
is
well
within
their
narrow
room
no
memories
haunt
their
hearts
who
dwell
within
the
grave
and
tomb
but
what
of
those
the
dead
who
live
the
living
dead
whose
lot
is
still
to
love
ah
god
forgive
to
live
and
love
forgot
storm
is
heard
sounding
wildly
with
wind
and
the
night
is
wild
with
rain
and
sleet
each
casement
claps
and
groans
i
hear
the
plangent
forest
beat
the
tempest
with
long
blatant
moans
as
of
despair
defeat
and
sitting
here
beyond
the
storm
alone
within
the
lonely
house
it
seems
that
some
mesmeric
charm
hangs
over
why
even
the
mouse
that
gnawed
has
come
to
harm
and
in
the
silence
stolen
all
things
i
strangely
seem
to
fear
myself
that
opening
yon
door
i
find
my
dead
self
drawing
near
with
face
that
once
i
wore
the
stairway
creaks
with
ghostly
gusts
the
flue
moans
is
a
gorgon
throat
of
wailing
winds
ancestral
dusts
that
yonder
indian
coat
with
gray
and
spectral
crusts
are
trembled
or
can
it
be
that
he
who
wore
it
in
the
dance
or
battle
now
fills
shadowy
its
wampumed
skins
and
shakes
his
lance
and
warrior
plume
at
me
mere
fancy
yet
those
curtains
toss
mysteriously
as
if
some
dark
hand
moved
and
i
fear
to
cross
the
shadow
there
where
lies
that
spark
a
sunk
in
moss
outside
better
yes
i
yearn
to
walk
the
waste
where
sway
and
dip
the
dark
december
boughs
where
burn
some
late
last
leaves
that
drip
and
drip
no
matter
where
you
turn
where
sodden
soil
you
scarce
have
trod
fills
oozy
footprints
but
the
blind
night
there
tho
like
the
frown
of
god
presents
no
phantoms
to
the
mind
like
these
that
have
the
months
i
count
how
long
it
seems
since
summer
summer
when
with
her
there
on
her
porch
in
rainy
gleams
we
watched
the
flickering
lightning
stir
in
heavens
gray
as
dreams
when
all
the
west
a
sheet
of
gold
flared
like
some
titan
opened
forge
with
storm
revealing
manifold
vast
peaks
of
clouds
with
crag
and
gorge
where
thunder
torrents
rolled
then
came
the
wind
again
again
the
lightning
lit
the
world
and
how
the
tempest
roared
with
rushing
rain
we
could
not
where
is
it
now
that
tale
of
charlemagne
that
old
romance
ah
me
that
we
were
reading
till
we
heard
the
plunge
of
summer
thunder
sullenly
and
left
to
watch
the
lightning
lunge
and
winds
bend
down
each
that
summer
how
it
built
us
there
a
world
of
love
and
necromance
a
where
all
was
fair
an
island
sleeping
in
a
trance
of
lilied
light
and
air
where
every
flower
was
a
thought
and
every
bird
a
melody
and
every
fragrance
zephyr
brought
was
but
the
rainbowed
drapery
of
some
sweet
dream
long
sought
o
land
of
shadows
within
my
world
of
memories
around
whose
ruins
sweeps
the
foam
of
sorrow
immemorial
seas
by
whose
dark
shores
i
roam
how
long
in
your
wrecked
halls
alone
with
ghosts
of
joys
must
i
remain
between
the
unknown
and
the
known
still
listening
to
the
wind
and
rain
and
my
own
heart
wild
moan
sits
by
the
slowly
dying
fire
the
storm
is
heard
with
increased
wild
weather
the
lash
of
the
sleet
on
the
gusty
casement
tapping
the
sound
of
the
storm
like
a
sheet
my
soul
and
senses
wrapping
wild
weather
and
how
is
she
now
the
rush
of
the
rain
falls
serried
over
the
turf
and
the
tree
of
the
place
where
she
is
buried
wild
weather
how
black
and
deep
is
the
night
where
the
mad
winds
scurry
do
i
sleep
do
i
dream
in
my
sleep
that
i
hear
her
footsteps
hurry
hither
they
come
like
flowers
and
i
see
her
raiment
glisten
like
the
robe
of
one
of
the
hours
where
the
stars
to
the
angels
listen
before
me
behold
how
she
stands
with
lips
high
thoughts
have
weighted
and
testifying
hands
and
eyes
with
glory
sated
i
have
spoken
and
i
have
kneeled
i
have
kissed
her
feet
in
wonder
but
lo
her
lips
they
are
sealed
and
will
not
sunder
though
i
sob
your
stay
was
long
you
are
come
but
your
feet
were
laggard
with
mansuetude
and
song
for
the
soul
your
death
has
daggered
never
a
word
replies
never
to
all
my
weeping
only
a
sound
of
sighs
and
raiment
past
me
sweeping
i
wake
and
a
clock
strikes
three
and
the
night
and
the
storm
beat
serried
over
the
turf
and

there
will
be
many
to

that
this

entitles

to
recognition
as
the
interpreter

it
is
doubtful
if
any

has
written
a
finer
more

nobly
and
righteously
wrathful
outburst
against

maladies
of

have
