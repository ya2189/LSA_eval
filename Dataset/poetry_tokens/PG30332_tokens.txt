july
august
may
o
love
this
morn
when
the
sweet
nightingale
had
so
long
finished
all
he
had
to
say
that
thou
hadst
slept
and
sleep
had
told
his
tale
and
midst
a
peaceful
dream
had
stolen
away
in
fragrant
dawning
of
the
first
of
may
didst
thou
see
aught
didst
thou
hear
voices
sing
ere
to
the
risen
sun
the
bells
ring
for
then
methought
the
lord
of
love
went
by
to
take
possession
of
his
flowery
throne
ringed
round
with
maids
and
youths
and
minstrelsy
a
little
while
i
sighed
to
find
him
gone
a
little
while
the
dawning
was
alone
and
the
light
gathered
then
i
held
my
breath
and
shuddered
at
the
sight
of
eld
and
death
alas
love
passed
me
in
the
twilight
dun
his
music
hushed
the
wakening
ousel
song
but
on
these
twain
shone
out
the
golden
sun
and
their
heads
the
brown
bird
tune
was
strong
as
shivering
twixt
the
trees
they
stole
along
none
noted
aught
their
noiseless
passing
by
the
world
had
quite
forgotten
it
must
die
now
must
these
men
be
glad
a
little
while
that
they
had
lived
to
see
may
once
more
smile
upon
the
earth
wherefore
as
men
who
know
how
fast
the
bad
days
and
the
good
days
go
they
gathered
at
the
feast
the
fair
abode
wherein
they
sat
across
the
road
unhedged
green
meads
which
willowy
streams
passed
through
and
on
that
morn
before
the
fresh
may
dew
had
dried
upon
the
sunniest
spot
of
grass
from
bush
to
bush
did
youths
and
maidens
pass
in
raiment
meet
for
may
apparelled
gathering
the
blossoms
and
the
red
and
now
with
noon
long
past
and
that
bright
day
growing
aweary
on
the
sunny
way
they
wandered
crowned
with
flowers
and
loitering
and
weary
yet
were
fresh
enough
to
sing
the
carols
of
the
morn
and
pensive
still
had
cast
away
their
doubt
of
death
and
ill
and
flushed
with
love
no
more
grew
red
with
shame
so
to
the
elders
as
they
sat
there
came
with
scent
of
flowers
the
murmur
of
that
folk
wherethrough
from
time
to
time
a
song
outbroke
till
scarce
they
thought
about
the
story
due
yet
when
anigh
to
it
grew
a
book
upon
the
board
an
elder
laid
and
turning
from
the
open
window
said
too
fair
a
tale
the
lovely
time
doth
ask
for
this
of
mine
to
be
an
easy
task
yet
in
what
words
soever
this
is
writ
as
for
the
matter
i
dare
say
of
it
that
it
is
lovely
as
the
lovely
may
pass
then
the
manner
since
the
learned
say
no
written
record
was
there
of
the
tale
ere
we
from
our
fair
land
of
greece
set
sail
how
this
may
be
i
know
not
this
i
know
that
tales
the
wind
would
seem
to
blow
from
place
to
place
as
the
feathery
seed
is
borne
across
the
sea
to
help
the
need
of
barren
isles
so
sirs
from
seed
thus
sown
this
flower
a
gift
from
other
lands
has
grown
the
story
of
cupid
and
psyche
argument
psyche
a
king
daughter
by
her
exceeding
beauty
caused
the
people
to
forget
venus
therefore
the
goddess
would
fain
have
destroyed
her
nevertheless
she
became
the
bride
of
love
yet
in
an
unhappy
moment
lost
him
by
her
own
fault
and
wandering
through
the
world
suffered
many
evils
at
the
hands
of
venus
for
whom
she
must
accomplish
fearful
tasks
but
the
gods
and
all
nature
helped
her
and
in
process
of
time
she
was
reunited
to
love
forgiven
by
venus
and
made
immortal
by
the
father
of
gods
and
men
in
the
greek
land
of
old
there
was
a
king
happy
in
battle
rich
in
everything
most
rich
in
this
that
he
a
daughter
had
whose
beauty
made
the
longing
city
glad
she
was
so
fair
that
strangers
from
the
sea
just
landed
in
the
temples
thought
that
she
was
venus
visible
to
mortal
eyes
new
come
from
cyprus
for
a
world
surprise
she
was
so
beautiful
that
had
she
stood
on
windy
ida
by
the
oaken
wood
and
bared
her
limbs
to
that
bold
shepherd
gaze
troy
might
have
stood
till
now
with
happy
days
and
those
three
fairest
all
have
left
the
land
and
left
her
with
the
apple
in
her
hand
and
psyche
is
her
name
in
stories
old
as
ever
by
our
fathers
we
were
told
all
this
beheld
queen
venus
from
her
throne
and
felt
that
she
no
longer
was
alone
in
beauty
but
if
only
for
a
while
this
maiden
matched
her
smile
therefore
she
wrought
in
such
a
wise
that
she
if
honoured
as
a
goddess
certainly
was
dreaded
as
a
goddess
none
the
less
and
midst
her
wealth
dwelt
long
in
loneliness
two
sisters
had
she
and
men
deemed
them
fair
but
as
king
daughters
might
be
anywhere
and
these
to
men
of
name
and
great
estate
were
wedded
while
at
home
must
psyche
wait
the
sons
of
kings
before
her
silver
feet
still
bowed
and
sighed
for
her
in
measures
sweet
the
minstrels
to
the
people
sung
her
praise
yet
must
she
live
a
virgin
all
her
days
so
to
apollo
fane
her
father
sent
seeking
to
know
the
dreadful
gods
intent
and
therewith
sent
he
goodly
gifts
of
price
a
silken
veil
wrought
with
a
paradise
three
golden
bowls
set
round
with
many
a
gem
three
silver
robes
with
gold
in
every
hem
and
a
fair
ivory
image
of
the
god
that
underfoot
a
golden
serpent
trod
and
when
three
lords
with
these
were
gone
away
nor
could
return
until
the
fortieth
day
ill
was
the
king
at
ease
and
neither
took
joy
in
the
chase
or
in
the
pictured
book
the
skilled
athenian
limner
had
just
wrought
nor
in
the
golden
cloths
from
india
brought
at
last
the
day
came
for
those
lords
return
and
then
hope
and
fear
the
king
did
burn
as
on
his
throne
with
great
pomp
he
was
set
and
by
him
psyche
knowing
not
as
yet
why
they
had
gone
thus
waiting
at
noontide
they
in
the
palace
heard
a
voice
outside
and
soon
the
messengers
came
hurrying
and
with
pale
faces
knelt
before
the
king
and
rent
their
clothes
and
each
man
on
his
head
cast
dust
the
while
a
trembling
courtier
read
this
scroll
wherein
the
fearful
answer
lay
whereat
from
every
face
joy
passed
away
the
oracle
o
father
of
a
most
unhappy
maid
o
king
whom
all
the
world
henceforth
shall
know
as
wretched
among
wretches
be
afraid
to
ask
the
gods
thy
misery
to
show
but
if
thou
needs
must
hear
it
to
thy
woe
take
back
thy
gifts
to
feast
thine
eyes
upon
when
thine
own
flesh
and
blood
some
beast
hath
won
for
hear
thy
doom
a
rugged
rock
there
is
set
back
a
league
from
thine
own
palace
fair
there
leave
the
maid
that
she
may
wait
the
kiss
of
the
fell
monster
that
doth
harbour
there
this
is
the
mate
for
whom
her
yellow
hair
and
tender
limbs
have
been
so
fashioned
this
is
the
pillow
for
her
lovely
head
o
what
an
evil
from
thy
loins
shall
spring
for
all
the
world
this
monster
overturns
he
is
the
bane
of
every
mortal
thing
and
this
world
ruined
still
for
more
he
yearns
a
fire
there
goeth
from
his
mouth
that
burns
worse
than
the
flame
of
phlegethon
the
red
to
such
a
monster
shall
thy
maid
be
and
if
thou
sparest
now
to
do
this
thing
i
will
destroy
thee
and
thy
land
also
and
of
dead
corpses
shalt
thou
be
the
king
and
stumbling
through
the
dark
land
shalt
thou
go
howling
for
second
death
to
end
thy
woe
live
therefore
as
thou
mayst
and
do
my
will
and
be
a
king
that
men
may
envy
still
what
man
was
there
whose
face
changed
not
for
grief
at
hearing
this
psyche
shrunk
like
the
leaf
the
autumn
frost
first
touches
on
the
tree
stared
round
about
with
eyes
that
could
not
see
and
muttered
sounds
from
lips
that
said
no
word
and
still
within
her
ears
the
sentence
heard
when
all
was
said
and
silence
fell
on
all
marble
columns
and
adorned
wall
then
spoke
the
king
bowed
down
with
misery
what
help
is
left
o
daughter
let
us
die
or
else
together
fleeing
from
this
land
from
town
to
town
go
wandering
hand
in
hand
thou
and
i
daughter
till
all
men
forget
that
ever
on
a
throne
i
have
been
set
and
then
when
houseless
and
disconsolate
we
ask
an
alms
before
some
city
gate
the
gods
perchance
a
little
gift
may
give
and
suffer
thee
and
me
like
beasts
to
live
then
answered
psyche
through
her
bitter
tears
alas
my
father
i
have
known
these
years
that
with
some
woe
the
gods
have
dowered
me
and
weighed
riches
infelicity
ill
is
it
then
against
the
gods
to
strive
live
on
o
father
those
that
are
alive
may
still
be
happy
would
it
profit
me
to
live
awhile
and
ere
i
died
to
see
thee
perish
and
all
folk
who
love
me
well
and
then
at
last
be
dragged
myself
to
hell
cursed
of
all
men
nay
since
all
things
must
die
and
i
have
dreamed
not
of
eternity
why
weepest
thou
that
i
must
die
why
weepest
thou
cast
thought
of
shame
away
the
dead
are
not
ashamed
they
feel
no
pain
i
have
heard
folk
who
spoke
of
death
as
gain
and
yet
ah
god
if
i
had
been
some
maid
toiling
all
day
and
in
the
laid
asleep
on
rushes
had
i
only
died
before
this
sweet
life
i
had
fully
tried
upon
that
day
when
for
my
birth
men
sung
and
the
feasting
folk
the
sweet
bells
rung
and
therewith
she
arose
and
gat
away
and
in
her
chamber
mourning
long
she
lay
thinking
of
all
the
days
that
might
have
been
and
how
that
she
was
born
to
be
a
queen
the
prize
of
some
great
conqueror
of
renown
the
joy
of
many
a
country
and
fair
town
the
high
desire
of
every
prince
and
lord
one
who
could
fright
with
careless
smile
or
word
the
hearts
of
heroes
fearless
in
the
war
the
glory
of
the
world
the
unto
all
honour
and
all
earthly
fame
round
goes
the
wheel
and
death
and
deadly
shame
shall
be
her
lot
while
yet
of
her
men
sing
unwitting
that
the
gods
have
done
this
thing
long
time
she
lay
there
while
the
sunbeams
moved
over
her
body
through
the
flowers
she
loved
and
in
the
eaves
the
sparrows
chirped
outside
until
for
weariness
she
grew
and
into
an
unhappy
sleep
she
fell
but
of
the
luckless
king
now
must
we
tell
who
sat
devising
means
to
that
shame
until
the
frightened
people
thronging
came
about
the
palace
and
drove
back
the
guards
making
their
way
past
all
the
gates
and
wards
and
putting
chamberlains
and
marshals
by
surged
round
the
very
throne
tumultuously
then
knew
the
wretched
king
all
folk
had
heard
the
miserable
sentence
and
the
word
the
gods
had
spoken
and
from
out
his
seat
he
rose
and
spoke
in
humble
words
unmeet
for
a
great
king
and
prayed
them
give
him
grace
while
his
words
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
on
to
his
raiment
stiff
with
golden
thread
but
little
heeded
they
the
words
he
said
for
very
fear
had
made
them
pitiless
nor
cared
they
for
the
maid
and
her
distress
but
clashed
their
spears
together
and
cry
for
one
man
daughter
shall
the
people
die
and
this
fair
land
become
an
empty
name
because
thou
art
afraid
to
meet
the
shame
wherewith
the
gods
reward
thy
hidden
sin
nay
by
their
glory
do
us
right
herein
ye
are
in
haste
to
have
a
poor
maid
slain
the
king
said
but
my
will
herein
is
vain
for
ye
are
many
i
one
aged
man
let
one
man
speak
if
for
his
shame
he
can
then
stepped
a
sturdy
dyer
forth
who
said
fear
of
the
gods
brings
no
shame
by
my
head
listen
thy
daughter
we
would
have
thee
leave
upon
the
fated
mountain
this
same
eve
and
thither
must
she
go
right
well
arrayed
in
marriage
raiment
loose
hair
as
a
maid
and
saffron
veil
and
with
her
shall
there
go
fair
maidens
bearing
torches
two
and
two
and
minstrels
in
such
raiment
as
is
meet
the
fearful
spouse
to
greet
so
shalt
thou
save
our
wives
and
little
ones
and
something
better
than
a
heap
of
stones
dwelt
in
by
noisesome
things
this
town
shall
be
and
thou
thyself
shalt
keep
thy
sovereignty
but
if
thou
wilt
not
do
the
thing
i
say
then
shalt
thou
live
in
bonds
from
this
same
day
and
we
will
bear
thy
maid
unto
the
hill
and
from
the
dread
gods
save
the
city
still
then
loud
they
shouted
at
the
words
he
said
and
round
the
head
of
the
unhappy
maid
dreaming
uneasily
of
joys
floated
the
echo
of
that
dreadful
noise
and
changed
her
dreams
to
dreams
of
misery
but
when
the
king
knew
that
the
thing
must
be
and
that
no
help
there
was
in
this
distress
he
bade
them
have
all
things
in
readiness
to
take
the
maiden
out
at
and
wed
her
to
the
unknown
dreadful
thing
so
through
the
palace
passed
with
heavy
cheer
her
women
gathering
the
sad
wedding
gear
who
lingering
long
yet
at
the
last
must
go
to
waken
psyche
to
her
bitter
woe
so
coming
to
her
bower
they
found
her
there
from
head
to
foot
rolled
in
her
yellow
hair
as
in
the
saffron
veil
she
should
be
soon
betwixt
the
setting
sun
and
rising
moon
but
when
above
her
a
pale
maiden
bent
and
touched
her
from
her
heart
a
sigh
she
sent
and
waking
on
their
woeful
faces
stared
sitting
upright
with
one
white
shoulder
bared
by
writhing
on
the
bed
in
wretchedness
then
suddenly
remembering
her
distress
she
bowed
her
head
and
to
weep
and
wail
but
let
them
wrap
her
in
the
bridal
veil
and
bind
the
sandals
to
her
silver
feet
and
set
the
on
her
tresses
sweet
but
spoke
no
word
yea
rather
wearily
turned
from
the
yearning
face
and
pitying
eye
of
any
maid
who
seemed
about
to
speak
now
through
the
garden
trees
the
sun
break
and
that
inevitable
time
drew
near
then
through
the
courts
grown
cruel
strange
and
drear
since
the
bright
morn
they
led
her
to
the
gate
where
she
beheld
a
golden
litter
wait
whereby
the
king
stood
aged
and
bent
to
earth
the
with
faces
void
of
mirth
the
bearers
of
the
ivory
wands
the
maiden
unhappy
bands
so
then
was
psyche
taken
to
the
hill
and
through
the
town
the
streets
were
void
and
still
for
in
their
houses
all
the
people
stayed
of
that
most
mournful
music
sore
afraid
but
on
the
way
a
marvel
did
they
see
for
passing
by
where
wrought
of
ivory
there
stood
the
goddess
of
the
flowery
isle
all
folk
could
see
the
carven
image
smile
but
when
anigh
the
hill
bare
top
they
came
where
psyche
must
be
left
to
meet
her
shame
they
set
the
litter
down
and
drew
aside
the
golden
curtains
from
the
wretched
bride
who
at
their
bidding
rose
and
with
them
went
afoot
amidst
her
maids
with
head
until
they
came
unto
the
drear
rock
brow
and
there
she
stood
apart
not
weeping
now
but
pale
as
privet
blossom
is
in
june
there
as
the
quivering
flutes
left
off
their
tune
in
trembling
arms
the
weeping
haggard
king
caught
psyche
who
like
some
thing
took
all
his
kisses
and
no
word
could
say
until
at
last
perforce
he
turned
away
because
the
longest
agony
has
end
and
homeward
through
the
twilight
did
they
wend
but
psyche
now
faint
and
bewildered
remembered
little
of
her
pain
and
dread
her
doom
drawn
nigh
took
all
her
fear
away
and
left
her
faint
and
weary
as
they
say
it
haps
to
one
who
a
lion
lies
who
stunned
and
helpless
feels
not
ere
he
dies
the
horror
of
the
yellow
fell
the
red
hot
mouth
and
white
teeth
gleaming
his
head
so
psyche
felt
as
sinking
on
the
ground
she
cast
one
weary
vacant
look
around
and
at
the
ending
of
that
wretched
day
swooning
beneath
the
risen
moon
she
lay
now
backward
must
our
story
go
awhile
and
unto
cyprus
the
fair
flowered
isle
where
hid
away
from
every
worshipper
was
venus
sitting
and
her
son
by
her
standing
to
mark
what
words
she
had
to
say
while
in
his
dreadful
wings
the
wind
did
play
frowning
she
spoke
in
plucking
from
her
thigh
the
fragrant
flowers
that
clasped
it
lovingly
in
such
a
town
o
son
a
maid
there
is
whom
any
amorous
man
this
day
would
kiss
as
gladly
as
a
goddess
like
to
me
and
though
i
know
an
end
to
this
must
be
when
white
and
red
and
gold
are
waxen
grey
down
on
the
earth
while
unto
me
one
day
is
as
another
yet
behold
my
son
and
go
through
all
my
temples
one
by
one
and
look
what
incense
rises
unto
me
hearken
the
talk
of
sailors
from
the
sea
just
landed
ever
will
it
be
the
same
thou
then
seen
her
yea
unto
my
shame
within
the
temple
that
is
calléd
mine
as
through
the
veil
i
watched
the
altar
shine
this
happed
a
man
with
outstretched
hand
there
stood
glittering
in
arms
of
smiling
joyous
mood
with
crisp
black
hair
and
such
a
face
one
sees
but
seldom
now
and
limbs
like
hercules
but
as
he
stood
there
in
my
holy
place
across
mine
image
came
the
maiden
face
and
when
he
saw
her
straight
the
warrior
said
turning
about
unto
an
earthly
maid
lady
venus
thou
art
kind
to
me
after
so
much
of
wandering
on
the
sea
to
show
thy
very
body
to
me
here
but
when
this
impious
saying
i
did
hear
i
sent
them
a
great
portent
for
straightway
i
quenched
the
fire
and
no
priest
on
that
day
could
light
it
any
more
for
all
his
prayer
so
must
she
fall
so
must
her
golden
hair
flash
no
more
through
the
city
or
her
feet
be
seen
like
lilies
moving
down
the
street
no
more
must
men
watch
her
soft
raiment
cling
about
her
limbs
no
more
must
minstrels
sing
the
praises
of
her
arms
and
hidden
breast
and
thou
it
is
my
son
must
give
me
rest
from
all
this
worship
wearisomely
paid
unto
a
mortal
who
should
be
afraid
to
match
the
gods
in
beauty
take
thy
bow
and
dreadful
arrows
and
about
her
sow
the
seeds
of
folly
and
with
such
an
one
i
pray
thee
cause
her
mingle
fair
my
son
that
not
the
poorest
peasant
girl
in
greece
would
look
on
for
the
gift
of
jason
fleece
do
this
and
see
thy
mother
glad
again
and
free
from
insult
in
her
temples
reign
over
the
hearts
of
lovers
in
the
spring
mother
he
said
thou
askest
no
great
thing
some
wretch
too
bad
for
death
i
soon
shall
find
who
round
her
perfect
neck
his
arms
shall
wind
she
shall
be
driven
from
the
palace
gate
where
once
her
crowd
of
worshippers
would
wait
from
earliest
morning
till
the
dew
was
dry
on
chance
of
seeing
her
gold
gown
glancing
by
there
through
the
storm
of
curses
shall
she
go
in
evil
raiment
midst
the
winter
snow
or
in
the
summer
in
rough
sheepskins
clad
and
thus
o
mother
shall
i
make
thee
glad
remembering
all
the
honour
thou
hast
brought
unto
mine
altars
since
as
thine
own
thought
my
thought
is
grown
my
mind
as
thy
dear
mind
then
straight
he
rose
from
earth
and
down
the
wind
went
glittering
the
blue
sky
and
the
sea
and
so
unto
the
place
came
presently
where
psyche
dwelt
and
through
the
gardens
fair
passed
seeking
her
and
as
he
wandered
there
had
still
no
thought
but
to
do
all
her
will
nor
cared
to
think
if
it
were
good
or
ill
so
beautiful
and
pitiless
he
went
and
toward
him
still
the
blossomed
leant
and
after
him
the
wind
crept
murmuring
and
on
the
boughs
the
birds
forgot
to
sing
withal
at
last
amidst
a
fair
green
close
hedged
round
about
with
woodbine
and
red
rose
within
the
flicker
of
a
shade
in
gentle
sleep
he
found
the
maiden
laid
one
hand
that
held
a
book
had
fallen
away
across
her
body
and
the
other
lay
upon
a
marble
fountain
plashing
rim
among
whose
broken
waves
the
fish
showed
dim
but
yet
its
spray
now
woke
her
not
because
the
summer
day
at
noon
was
hot
and
all
sweet
sounds
and
scents
were
lulling
her
so
soon
the
rustle
of
his
wings
stir
her
looser
folds
of
raiment
and
the
hair
spread
wide
upon
the
grass
and
daisies
fair
as
love
cast
down
his
eyes
with
a
half
smile
godlike
and
cruel
that
faded
in
a
while
and
long
he
stood
above
her
hidden
eyes
with
red
lips
parted
in
a
god
surprise
then
very
love
knelt
down
beside
the
maid
and
on
her
breast
a
hand
unfelt
he
laid
and
drew
the
gown
from
off
her
dainty
feet
and
set
his
fair
cheek
to
her
shoulder
sweet
and
kissed
her
lips
that
knew
of
no
love
yet
and
wondered
if
his
heart
would
forget
the
perfect
arm
that
her
body
lay
but
now
by
chance
a
damsel
came
that
way
one
of
her
ladies
and
saw
not
the
god
yet
on
his
shafts
cast
down
had
trod
in
wakening
psyche
who
rose
up
in
haste
and
girded
up
her
gown
about
her
waist
and
with
that
maid
went
drowsily
away
from
place
to
place
love
followed
her
that
day
and
ever
fairer
to
his
eyes
she
grew
so
that
at
last
when
from
her
bower
he
flew
and
underneath
his
feet
the
moonlit
sea
went
shepherding
his
waves
disorderly
he
swore
that
of
all
gods
and
men
no
one
should
hold
her
in
his
arms
but
he
alone
that
she
should
dwell
with
him
in
glorious
wise
like
to
a
goddess
in
some
paradise
yea
he
would
get
from
father
jove
this
grace
that
she
should
never
die
but
her
sweet
face
and
wonderful
fair
body
should
endure
till
the
foundations
of
the
mountains
sure
were
molten
in
the
sea
so
utterly
did
he
forget
his
mother
cruelty
and
now
that
he
might
come
to
this
fair
end
he
found
apollo
and
besought
him
lend
his
throne
of
divination
for
a
while
whereby
he
did
the
priestess
there
beguile
to
give
the
cruel
answer
ye
have
heard
unto
those
lords
who
wrote
it
word
by
word
and
back
unto
the
king
its
threatenings
bore
whereof
there
came
that
grief
and
mourning
sore
of
which
ye
wot
thereby
is
psyche
laid
upon
the
thereby
afraid
of
some
ill
yet
within
the
city
fair
cower
down
the
people
that
have
sent
her
there
withal
did
love
call
unto
him
the
wind
called
zephyrus
who
most
was
to
his
mind
and
said
o
rainy
wooer
of
the
spring
i
pray
thee
do
for
me
an
easy
thing
to
such
a
go
o
gentle
wind
and
there
a
sleeping
maiden
shalt
thou
find
her
perfect
body
in
thine
arms
with
care
take
up
and
unto
the
green
valley
bear
that
lies
before
my
noble
house
of
gold
there
leave
her
lying
on
the
daisies
cold
then
smiling
toward
the
place
the
fair
wind
went
while
his
wing
the
sleeping
lilies
bent
and
flying
the
green
earth
and
the
sea
made
the
huge
anchored
ships
dance
merrily
and
swung
round
from
the
east
the
gilded
vanes
on
many
a
palace
and
from
unhorsed
wains
twitched
off
the
in
his
hurried
flight
but
ere
much
time
had
passed
he
came
in
sight
of
psyche
laid
in
swoon
upon
the
hill
and
smiling
set
himself
to
do
love
will
for
in
his
arms
he
took
her
up
with
care
wondering
to
see
a
mortal
made
so
fair
and
came
into
the
vale
in
little
space
and
set
her
down
in
the
most
flowery
place
and
then
unto
the
plains
of
thessaly
went
ruffling
up
the
edges
of
the
sea
now
underneath
the
world
the
moon
was
gone
but
brighter
shone
the
stars
so
left
alone
until
a
faint
green
light
began
to
show
far
in
the
east
whereby
did
all
men
know
who
lay
awake
either
with
joy
or
pain
that
day
was
coming
on
their
heads
again
then
widening
soon
it
spread
to
grey
twilight
and
in
a
while
with
gold
the
east
was
bright
the
birds
burst
out
one
by
one
and
the
rose
the
mighty
sun
therewith
did
psyche
open
wide
her
eyes
and
rising
on
her
arm
with
great
surprise
gazed
on
the
flowers
wherein
so
deep
she
lay
and
wondered
why
upon
that
dawn
of
day
out
in
the
fields
she
had
lift
up
her
head
rather
than
in
her
balmy
bed
then
suddenly
remembering
all
her
woes
she
sprang
upon
her
feet
and
yet
arose
within
her
heart
a
mingled
hope
and
dread
of
some
new
thing
and
now
she
raised
her
head
and
gazing
round
about
her
timidly
a
lovely
grassy
valley
could
she
see
that
steep
grey
cliffs
upon
three
sides
did
bound
and
under
these
a
river
sweeping
round
with
gleaming
curves
the
valley
did
embrace
and
seemed
to
make
an
island
of
that
place
and
all
about
were
dotted
leafy
trees
the
elm
for
shade
the
linden
for
the
bees
the
noble
oak
long
ready
for
the
steel
which
in
that
place
it
had
no
fear
to
feel
the
pomegranate
the
apple
and
the
pear
that
fruit
and
flowers
at
once
made
shift
to
bear
nor
yet
decayed
therefor
and
in
them
hung
bright
birds
that
elsewhere
sing
not
but
here
sung
as
sweetly
as
the
small
brown
nightingales
within
the
wooded
deep
laconian
vales
but
right
across
the
vale
from
side
to
side
a
high
white
wall
all
further
view
did
hide
but
that
above
it
vane
and
pinnacle
rose
up
of
some
great
house
beyond
to
tell
and
still
betwixt
these
mountains
far
away
against
the
sky
rose
shadowy
cold
and
grey
she
standing
in
the
yellow
morning
sun
could
scarcely
think
her
happy
life
was
done
or
that
the
place
was
made
for
misery
yea
some
lone
heaven
it
rather
seemed
to
be
which
for
the
coming
band
of
gods
did
wait
hope
touched
her
heart
no
longer
desolate
deserted
of
all
creatures
did
she
feel
and
her
face
sweet
colour
to
steal
that
deepened
to
a
flush
as
wandering
thought
desires
before
unknown
unto
her
brought
so
mighty
was
the
god
though
far
away
but
trembling
midst
her
hope
she
took
her
way
unto
a
little
door
midmost
the
wall
and
still
on
odorous
flowers
her
feet
did
fall
and
round
about
her
did
the
strange
birds
sing
praising
her
beauty
in
their
carolling
thus
coming
to
the
door
when
now
her
hand
first
touched
the
lock
in
doubt
she
needs
must
stand
and
to
herself
she
said
lo
here
the
trap
and
yet
alas
whatever
now
may
hap
how
can
i
the
ill
which
waiteth
me
let
me
die
now
and
herewith
tremblingly
she
raised
the
latch
and
her
sweet
sinless
eyes
beheld
a
garden
like
a
paradise
void
of
mankind
fairer
than
words
can
say
wherein
did
joyous
harmless
creatures
play
after
their
kind
and
all
amidst
the
trees
were
founts
and
wondrous
images
and
glimmering
the
boughs
could
she
behold
a
house
made
beautiful
with
beaten
gold
whose
open
doors
in
the
bright
sun
did
gleam
lonely
but
not
deserted
did
it
seem
long
time
she
stood
debating
what
to
do
but
at
the
last
she
passed
the
wicket
through
which
shutting
clamorously
behind
her
sent
a
pang
of
fear
throughout
her
as
she
went
but
when
through
all
that
green
place
she
had
passed
and
by
the
palace
porch
she
stood
at
last
and
saw
how
wonderfully
the
wall
was
wrought
with
curious
stones
from
countries
brought
and
many
an
image
and
fair
history
of
what
the
world
has
been
and
yet
shall
be
and
all
set
round
with
golden
craftsmanship
as
some
renowned
cup
royal
lip
she
had
a
thought
again
to
turn
aside
and
yet
again
not
knowing
where
to
bide
she
entered
softly
and
with
trembling
hands
holding
her
gown
the
wonder
of
all
lands
met
there
the
wonders
of
the
land
and
sea
now
went
she
through
the
chambers
tremblingly
and
oft
in
going
would
she
pause
and
stand
and
drop
the
gathered
raiment
from
her
hand
stilling
the
beating
of
her
heart
for
fear
as
voices
whispering
low
she
seemed
to
hear
but
then
again
the
wind
it
seemed
to
be
moving
the
golden
hangings
doubtfully
or
some
bewildered
swallow
passing
close
unto
the
pane
or
some
rose
soon
seeing
that
no
evil
thing
came
near
a
little
she
began
to
lose
her
fear
and
gaze
upon
the
wonders
of
the
place
and
in
the
silver
mirrors
saw
her
face
grown
strange
to
her
amidst
that
loneliness
and
stooped
to
feel
the
web
her
feet
did
press
wrought
by
the
brown
indian
toil
amidst
the
years
of
war
and
vain
turmoil
or
she
the
figures
of
the
hangings
felt
or
daintily
the
unknown
blossoms
smelt
or
stood
and
pondered
what
new
thing
might
mean
the
images
of
knight
and
king
and
queen
wherewith
the
walls
were
pictured
here
and
there
or
touched
rich
vessels
with
her
fingers
fair
and
her
delicate
smooth
cheek
would
pass
the
bubbles
of
strange
works
of
glass
so
wandered
she
amidst
these
marvels
new
until
anigh
the
noontide
now
it
grew
at
last
she
came
unto
a
chamber
cool
paved
cunningly
in
manner
of
a
pool
where
red
fish
seemed
to
swim
through
floating
weed
and
at
the
first
she
thought
it
so
indeed
and
took
the
sandals
quickly
from
her
feet
but
when
the
glassy
floor
these
did
but
meet
the
shadow
of
a
smile
her
anxious
face
a
moment
did
beguile
and
crossing
she
found
a
table
spread
with
dainty
food
as
delicate
white
bread
and
fruits
piled
up
and
covered
savoury
meat
as
though
a
king
were
coming
there
to
eat
for
the
worst
vessel
was
of
beaten
gold
now
when
these
dainties
psyche
did
behold
she
fain
had
eaten
but
did
nowise
dare
thinking
she
saw
a
god
feast
lying
there
but
as
she
turned
to
go
the
way
she
came
she
heard
a
low
soft
voice
call
out
her
name
then
she
stood
still
and
trembling
gazed
around
and
seeing
no
man
nigh
sank
upon
the
ground
then
through
the
empty
air
she
heard
the
voice
o
lovely
one
fear
not
rather
rejoice
that
thou
art
come
unto
thy
sovereignty
sit
now
and
eat
this
feast
is
but
for
thee
yea
do
whatso
thou
wilt
with
all
things
here
and
in
thine
own
house
cast
away
thy
fear
for
all
is
thine
and
little
things
are
these
so
loved
a
heart
as
thine
awhile
to
please
be
patient
thou
art
loved
by
such
an
one
as
will
not
leave
thee
mourning
here
alone
but
rather
cometh
on
this
very
night
and
though
he
needs
must
hide
him
from
thy
sight
yet
all
his
words
of
love
thou
well
mayst
hear
and
pour
thy
woes
into
no
careless
ear
bethink
thee
then
with
what
solemnity
thy
folk
thy
father
did
deliver
thee
to
him
who
loves
thee
thus
and
void
of
dread
remember
sweet
thou
art
a
bride
now
hearing
this
did
psyche
trembling
sore
and
yet
with
lighter
heart
than
heretofore
sit
down
and
eat
till
she
grew
scarce
afeard
and
nothing
but
the
summer
noise
she
heard
within
the
garden
then
her
meal
being
done
within
the
she
watched
the
sun
changing
the
till
she
grew
fearless
and
happy
since
she
deemed
she
knew
the
worst
that
could
befall
while
still
the
best
shone
a
fair
star
far
off
and
mid
the
rest
this
brought
her
after
all
her
grief
and
fear
she
said
how
sweet
it
would
be
could
i
hear
soft
music
mate
the
drowsy
afternoon
and
drown
awhile
the
bees
sad
murmuring
tune
within
these
flowering
limes
as
she
spoke
a
choir
of
unknown
unseen
folk
singing
to
words
that
match
the
sense
of
these
hushed
the
faint
music
of
the
linden
trees
song
o
pensive
tender
maid
downcast
and
shy
who
turnest
pale
at
the
name
of
love
and
with
flushed
face
must
pass
the
by
ashamed
to
hear
the
passionate
grey
dove
moan
to
his
mate
thee
too
the
god
shall
move
thee
too
the
maidens
shall
ungird
one
day
and
with
thy
girdle
put
thy
shame
away
what
then
and
shall
white
winter
be
done
because
the
glittering
frosty
morn
is
fair
because
against
the
sun
bright
show
the
gilded
boughs
though
waste
and
bare
because
the
robin
singeth
free
from
care
ah
these
are
memories
of
a
better
day
when
on
earth
face
the
lips
of
summer
lay
come
then
beloved
one
for
such
as
thee
love
loveth
and
their
hearts
he
knoweth
well
who
hoard
their
moments
of
felicity
as
misers
hoard
the
medals
that
they
tell
lest
on
the
earth
but
paupers
they
should
dwell
we
hide
our
love
to
bless
another
day
the
world
is
hard
youth
passes
quick
they
say
ah
little
ones
but
if
ye
could
forget
amidst
your
outpoured
love
that
you
must
die
then
ye
my
servants
were
death
conquerors
yet
and
love
to
you
should
be
eternity
how
quick
soever
might
the
days
go
by
yes
ye
are
made
immortal
on
the
day
ye
cease
the
dusty
grains
of
time
to
weigh
thou
hearkenest
love
o
make
no
semblance
then
that
thou
art
loved
but
as
thy
custom
is
turn
thy
grey
eyes
away
from
eyes
of
men
with
hands
that
tremble
with
thy
bliss
with
hidden
eyes
take
thy
first
lover
kiss
call
this
eternity
which
is
nor
dream
that
this
our
love
can
pass
away
they
ceased
and
psyche
pondering
their
song
not
fearing
now
that
aught
would
do
her
wrong
about
the
chambers
wandered
at
her
will
and
on
the
many
marvels
gazed
her
fill
she
passed
still
noting
everything
then
in
the
gardens
heard
the
new
birds
sing
and
watched
the
red
fish
in
the
fountains
play
and
at
the
very
faintest
time
of
day
upon
the
grass
lay
sleeping
for
a
while
midst
dreams
of
bliss
that
made
her
smile
and
when
she
woke
the
shades
were
lengthening
so
to
the
place
where
she
had
heard
them
sing
she
came
again
and
through
a
little
door
entered
a
chamber
with
a
marble
floor
open
unto
the
outer
air
beneath
which
lay
a
bath
of
water
fair
paved
with
strange
stones
and
figures
of
bright
gold
and
from
the
steps
thereof
could
she
behold
the
trees
against
the
evening
sky
golden
and
calm
still
moving
languidly
so
for
a
time
upon
the
brink
she
sat
debating
in
her
mind
of
this
and
that
and
then
arose
and
slowly
from
her
cast
her
raiment
and
adown
the
steps
she
passed
into
the
water
and
therein
she
played
till
of
herself
at
last
she
grew
afraid
and
of
the
broken
image
of
her
face
and
the
loud
splashing
in
that
lonely
place
so
from
the
bath
she
gat
her
quietly
and
clad
herself
in
whatso
haste
might
be
and
when
at
last
she
was
apparelled
unto
a
chamber
came
where
was
a
bed
of
gold
and
ivory
and
precious
wood
some
island
bears
where
never
man
has
stood
and
round
about
hung
curtains
of
delight
wherein
were
interwoven
day
and
night
joined
by
the
hands
of
love
and
round
their
wings
knots
of
fair
flowers
no
earthly
brings
strange
for
its
beauty
was
the
coverlet
with
birds
and
beasts
and
flowers
wrought
over
it
and
every
cloth
was
made
in
daintier
wise
than
any
man
on
earth
could
well
devise
yea
there
such
beauty
was
in
everything
that
she
the
daughter
of
a
mighty
king
felt
strange
therein
and
trembled
lest
that
she
deceived
by
dreams
had
wandered
heedlessly
into
a
bower
for
some
fair
goddess
made
yet
if
perchance
some
man
had
thither
strayed
it
had
been
long
ere
he
had
noted
aught
but
her
sweet
face
made
pensive
by
the
thought
of
all
the
wonders
that
she
moved
in
there
but
looking
round
upon
a
table
fair
she
saw
a
book
wherein
old
tales
were
writ
and
by
the
window
sat
to
read
in
it
until
the
dusk
had
melted
into
night
when
waxen
tapers
did
her
servants
light
with
unseen
hands
until
it
grew
like
day
and
so
at
last
upon
the
bed
she
lay
and
slept
a
dreamless
sleep
for
weariness
forgetting
all
the
wonder
and
distress
but
at
the
dead
of
night
she
woke
and
heard
a
rustling
noise
and
grew
right
sore
afeard
yea
could
not
move
a
finger
for
affright
and
all
was
darker
now
than
darkest
night
withal
a
voice
close
by
her
did
she
hear
alas
my
love
why
tremblest
thou
with
fear
while
i
am
trembling
with
new
happiness
forgive
me
sweet
thy
terror
and
distress
not
otherwise
could
this
our
meeting
be
o
loveliest
such
bliss
awaiteth
thee
for
all
thy
trouble
and
thy
shameful
tears
such
nameless
honour
and
such
happy
years
as
fall
not
unto
women
of
the
earth
loved
as
thou
art
thy
pains
are
worth
the
glory
and
the
joy
unspeakable
wherein
the
treasure
of
the
world
shall
dwell
a
little
hope
a
little
patience
yet
ere
everything
thou
wilt
thou
forget
or
else
remember
as
a
tale
that
for
some
pensive
pleasure
may
avail
canst
thou
not
love
me
then
who
wrought
thy
woe
that
thou
the
height
and
depth
of
joy
mightst
know
he
spoke
and
as
upon
the
bed
she
lay
trembling
amidst
new
thoughts
he
sent
a
ray
of
finest
love
unto
her
inmost
heart
till
murmuring
low
she
strove
the
night
to
part
and
like
a
bride
who
meets
her
love
at
last
when
the
long
days
of
yearning
are
she
reached
to
him
her
perfect
arms
unseen
and
said
o
love
how
wretched
i
have
been
what
hast
thou
done
and
by
her
side
he
lay
till
just
before
the
dawning
of
the
day
the
sun
was
high
when
psyche
woke
again
and
turning
to
the
place
where
he
had
lain
and
seeing
no
one
doubted
of
the
thing
that
she
had
dreamed
it
till
a
fair
gold
ring
unseen
before
upon
her
hand
she
found
and
touching
her
bright
head
she
felt
it
crowned
with
a
bright
circlet
then
withal
she
sighed
and
wondered
how
the
oracle
had
lied
and
wished
her
father
knew
it
and
straightway
rose
up
and
clad
herself
slow
went
the
day
though
helped
with
many
a
solace
till
came
night
and
therewithal
the
new
unseen
delight
she
learned
to
call
her
love
so
passed
away
the
days
and
nights
until
upon
a
day
as
in
the
shade
at
noon
she
lay
asleep
she
dreamed
that
she
beheld
her
sisters
weep
and
her
old
father
clad
in
sorry
guise
grown
foolish
with
the
weight
of
miseries
her
friends
and
moving
mournfully
and
folk
in
wonder
landed
from
the
sea
at
such
a
fall
of
such
a
matchless
maid
and
in
some
press
apart
her
raiment
laid
like
precious
relics
and
an
empty
tomb
set
in
the
palace
telling
of
her
doom
therefore
she
wept
in
sleep
and
woke
with
tears
still
on
her
face
and
wet
hair
round
her
ears
and
went
about
unhappily
that
day
framing
a
gentle
speech
wherewith
to
pray
for
leave
to
see
her
sisters
once
again
that
they
might
know
her
happy
and
her
pain
turned
all
to
joy
and
honour
come
from
shame
and
so
at
last
night
and
her
lover
came
and
midst
their
fondling
suddenly
she
said
o
love
a
little
time
we
have
been
wed
and
yet
i
ask
a
boon
of
thee
this
night
psyche
he
said
if
my
heart
tells
me
right
this
thy
desire
may
bring
us
bitter
woe
for
who
the
shifting
chance
of
fate
can
know
yet
forasmuch
as
mortal
hearts
are
weak
shall
my
folk
thy
sisters
seek
and
bear
them
hither
but
before
the
day
is
fully
ended
must
they
go
away
and
thou
beware
for
fresh
and
good
and
true
thou
knowest
not
what
worldly
hearts
may
do
or
what
a
curse
gold
is
unto
the
earth
beware
lest
from
thy
full
heart
in
thy
mirth
thou
the
story
of
thy
love
unseen
thy
loving
simple
heart
fits
not
a
queen
then
by
her
kisses
did
she
know
he
frowned
but
close
about
him
her
fair
arms
she
wound
until
for
happiness
he
to
smile
and
in
those
arms
forgat
all
else
awhile
so
the
next
day
for
joy
that
they
should
come
would
psyche
further
deck
her
strange
new
home
and
even
as
she
to
think
the
thought
quickly
her
will
by
unseen
hands
was
wrought
who
came
and
went
like
thoughts
yea
how
should
i
tell
of
the
works
of
gold
and
ivory
the
gems
and
images
those
hands
brought
there
the
prisoned
things
of
earth
and
sea
and
air
they
brought
to
please
their
mistress
many
a
beast
such
as
king
bacchus
in
his
reckless
feast
makes
merry
with
huge
elephants
with
gilded
tusks
or
with
bright
and
shining
chains
about
their
wrinkled
necks
the
mailed
rhinoceros
that
of
nothing
recks
lions
spotted
leopards
fair
that
through
the
move
unseen
as
air
the
tiger
dread
of
the
brown
man
the
eagle
and
the
peacock
and
the
swan
these
be
the
nobles
of
the
birds
and
beasts
but
therewithal
for
laughter
at
their
feasts
they
brought
them
the
gods
jesters
such
as
be
apes
that
yet
in
mockery
of
anxious
men
wrinkle
their
ugly
brows
strange
birds
with
pouches
birds
with
beaks
like
prows
of
with
tufted
crests
like
threads
with
unimaginable
monstrous
heads
lo
such
as
these
in
many
a
gilded
cage
they
brought
or
chained
for
fear
of
sudden
rage
then
strewed
they
scented
branches
on
the
floor
and
hung
up
by
the
great
door
and
wafted
incense
through
the
bowers
and
halls
and
hung
up
fairer
hangings
on
the
walls
and
filled
the
baths
with
water
fresh
and
clear
and
in
the
chambers
laid
apparel
fair
and
spread
a
table
for
a
royal
feast
then
when
from
all
these
labours
they
had
ceased
psyche
they
sung
to
sleep
with
lullabies
who
slept
not
long
but
opening
soon
her
eyes
beheld
her
sisters
on
the
threshold
stand
then
did
she
run
to
take
them
by
the
hand
and
laid
her
cheek
to
theirs
and
murmured
words
of
little
meaning
like
the
moan
of
birds
while
they
bewildered
stood
and
gazed
around
like
people
who
in
some
strange
land
have
found
one
that
they
thought
not
of
but
she
at
last
stood
back
and
from
her
face
the
strayed
locks
cast
and
smiling
through
her
tears
said
ah
that
ye
should
have
to
weep
such
useless
tears
for
me
alas
the
burden
that
the
city
bears
for
nought
o
me
my
father
burning
tears
that
into
all
this
honour
i
am
come
nay
does
he
live
yet
is
the
ancient
home
still
standing
do
the
galleys
throng
the
quays
do
the
brown
indians
glitter
down
the
ways
with
rubies
as
of
old
yes
yes
ye
smile
for
ye
are
thinking
but
a
little
while
apart
from
these
has
she
been
dwelling
here
truly
yet
long
enough
loved
ones
and
dear
to
make
me
other
than
i
was
of
old
though
now
when
your
dear
faces
i
behold
am
i
myself
again
but
by
what
road
have
ye
been
brought
to
this
my
new
abode
sister
said
one
i
rose
up
from
my
bed
it
seems
this
morn
and
being
apparelléd
and
walking
in
my
garden
in
a
swoon
helpless
and
unattended
i
sank
down
wherefrom
i
scarce
am
waked
for
as
a
dream
dost
thou
with
all
this
royal
glory
seem
but
for
thy
kisses
and
thy
words
o
love
yea
psyche
said
the
other
as
i
drove
the
ivory
shuttle
through
the
all
was
changed
suddenly
and
in
this
place
i
found
myself
and
standing
on
my
feet
where
me
with
sleepy
words
this
one
did
greet
now
sister
tell
us
whence
these
wonders
come
with
all
the
godlike
splendour
of
your
home
sisters
she
said
more
marvels
shall
ye
see
when
ye
have
been
a
little
while
with
me
whereof
i
can
not
tell
you
more
than
this
that
them
all
i
dwell
in
ease
and
bliss
well
loved
and
wedded
to
a
mighty
lord
fair
beyond
measure
from
whose
loving
word
i
know
that
happier
days
await
me
yet
but
come
my
sisters
let
us
now
forget
to
seek
for
empty
knowledge
ye
shall
take
some
little
gifts
for
your
lost
sister
sake
and
whatso
wonders
ye
may
see
or
hear
of
nothing
frightful
have
ye
any
fear
wondering
they
went
with
her
and
looking
round
each
in
the
other
eyes
a
strange
look
found
for
these
her
mother
daughters
had
no
part
in
her
divine
fresh
singleness
of
heart
but
longing
to
be
great
remembered
not
how
short
a
time
one
heart
on
earth
has
got
but
keener
still
that
guarded
look
now
grew
as
more
of
that
strange
lovely
place
they
knew
and
as
with
growing
hate
but
still
afeard
the
unseen
choirs
strains
they
heard
which
did
but
harden
these
and
when
at
noon
they
sought
the
shaded
waters
freshening
boon
and
all
unhidden
once
again
they
saw
that
peerless
beauty
free
from
any
flaw
which
now
at
last
had
won
its
precious
meed
her
kindness
then
but
fed
the
fire
of
greed
within
their
hearts
her
gifts
the
rich
attire
wherewith
she
clad
them
where
like
sparks
of
fire
the
gems
shone
midst
the
pearls
the
soft
silks
winding
lines
the
work
of
girls
by
the
five
rivers
their
fair
marvellous
crowns
their
sandals
fastenings
worth
the
rent
of
towns
zones
and
carved
rings
and
nameless
wonders
fair
all
things
her
faithful
slaves
had
brought
them
there
given
amid
kisses
made
them
not
more
glad
since
in
their
hearts
the
ravening
worm
they
had
that
love
slays
not
nor
yet
is
satisfied
while
aught
but
he
has
aught
yet
still
they
tried
to
look
as
they
deemed
loving
folk
should
look
and
still
with
words
of
love
her
bounty
took
so
at
the
last
all
being
apparelléd
her
sisters
to
the
banquet
psyche
led
fair
were
they
and
each
seemed
a
glorious
queen
with
all
that
wondrous
daintiness
beseen
but
psyche
clad
in
gown
of
dusky
blue
little
adorned
with
deep
grey
eyes
that
knew
the
hidden
marvels
of
love
holy
fire
seemed
like
the
soul
of
innocent
desire
shut
from
the
mocking
world
wherefrom
those
twain
seemed
come
to
lure
her
thence
with
labour
vain
now
having
reached
the
place
where
they
should
eat
ere
the
canopy
the
three
took
seat
the
eldest
sister
unto
psyche
said
and
he
dear
love
the
man
that
thou
hast
wed
will
he
not
wish
thy
kin
to
see
then
could
we
tell
of
thy
felicity
the
better
to
our
folk
and
father
dear
then
psyche
reddened
nay
he
is
not
here
she
stammered
neither
will
be
here
for
mighty
matters
keep
him
far
away
alas
the
younger
sister
said
say
then
what
is
the
likeness
of
this
first
of
men
what
sayest
thou
about
his
loving
eyne
are
his
locks
black
or
as
thine
like
me
said
psyche
stammering
and
looking
round
what
say
i
like
the
king
who
rules
the
world
he
seems
to
me
at
least
come
sisters
sit
and
let
us
make
good
feast
my
darling
and
my
love
ye
shall
behold
i
doubt
not
soon
his
crispy
hair
of
gold
his
eyes
unseen
and
ye
shall
hear
his
voice
that
in
my
joy
ye
also
may
rejoice
then
did
they
hold
their
peace
although
indeed
her
stammering
haste
they
did
not
fail
to
heed
but
at
their
wondrous
royal
feast
they
sat
thinking
their
thoughts
and
spoke
of
this
or
that
between
the
bursts
of
music
until
when
the
sun
was
leaving
the
abodes
of
men
and
then
must
psyche
to
her
sisters
say
that
she
was
bid
her
husband
being
away
to
suffer
none
at
night
to
harbour
there
no
not
the
mother
that
her
body
bare
or
father
that
begat
her
therefore
they
must
leave
her
now
till
some
still
happier
day
and
therewithal
more
precious
gifts
she
brought
whereof
not
in
dreams
they
could
have
thought
things
whereof
noble
stories
might
be
told
and
said
these
matters
that
you
here
behold
shall
be
the
worst
of
gifts
that
you
shall
have
farewell
farewell
and
may
the
high
gods
save
your
lives
and
fame
and
tell
our
father
dear
of
all
the
honour
that
i
live
in
here
and
how
that
greater
happiness
shall
come
when
i
shall
reach
a
home
then
these
though
burning
through
the
night
to
stay
spake
loving
words
and
went
upon
their
way
when
weeping
she
had
kissed
them
but
they
wept
such
tears
as
traitors
do
for
as
they
stepped
over
the
threshold
in
each
other
eyes
they
looked
for
each
was
eager
to
surprise
the
envy
that
their
hearts
were
filled
withal
that
to
their
lips
came
welling
up
like
gall
so
said
the
first
this
palace
without
folk
these
wonders
done
with
none
to
strike
a
stroke
this
singing
in
the
air
and
no
one
seen
these
gifts
too
wonderful
for
any
queen
the
trance
wherein
we
both
were
wrapt
away
and
set
down
by
her
golden
house
these
are
the
deeds
of
gods
and
not
of
men
and
fortunate
the
day
was
to
her
when
weeping
she
left
the
house
where
we
were
born
and
all
men
deemed
her
shamed
and
most
forlorn
then
said
the
other
reddening
in
her
rage
she
is
the
luckiest
one
of
all
this
age
and
yet
she
might
have
told
us
of
her
case
what
god
it
is
that
dwelleth
in
the
place
nor
sent
us
forth
like
beggars
from
her
gate
and
beggarly
o
sister
is
our
fate
whose
husbands
wring
from
miserable
hinds
what
the
first
battle
scatters
to
the
winds
while
she
to
us
whom
from
her
door
she
drives
and
makes
of
no
account
or
honour
gives
such
wonderful
and
priceless
gifts
as
these
fit
to
bedeck
the
limbs
of
goddesses
and
yet
who
knows
but
she
may
get
a
fall
the
strongest
tower
has
not
the
highest
wall
think
well
of
this
when
you
sit
safe
at
home
by
this
unto
the
river
were
they
come
where
waited
zephyrus
unseen
who
cast
a
languor
over
them
that
quickly
passed
into
deep
sleep
and
on
the
grass
they
sank
then
straightway
did
he
lift
them
from
the
bank
and
quickly
each
in
her
fair
house
set
down
then
flew
aloft
above
the
sleeping
town
long
in
their
homes
they
brooded
over
this
and
how
that
psyche
nigh
a
goddess
is
while
all
folk
deemed
that
she
quite
lost
had
been
for
nought
they
said
of
all
that
they
had
seen
but
now
that
night
when
she
with
many
a
kiss
had
told
their
coming
and
of
that
and
this
that
happed
he
said
these
things
o
love
are
well
glad
am
i
that
no
evil
thing
befell
and
yet
between
thy
father
house
and
me
must
thou
choose
now
then
either
royally
shalt
thou
go
home
and
wed
some
king
at
last
and
have
no
harm
for
all
that
here
has
passed
or
else
my
love
bear
as
thy
brave
heart
may
this
loneliness
in
hope
of
that
fair
day
which
by
my
head
shall
come
to
thee
and
then
shalt
thou
be
glorious
to
the
sons
of
men
and
by
my
side
shalt
sit
in
such
estate
that
in
all
time
all
men
shall
sing
thy
fate
but
with
that
word
such
love
through
her
he
breathed
that
round
about
him
her
fair
arms
she
wreathed
and
so
with
loving
passed
the
night
away
and
with
fresh
hope
came
on
the
fresh
and
so
passed
many
a
day
and
many
a
night
and
weariness
was
balanced
with
delight
and
into
such
a
mind
was
psyche
brought
that
little
of
her
father
house
she
thought
but
ever
of
the
happy
day
to
come
when
she
should
go
unto
her
promised
home
till
she
that
threw
the
golden
apple
down
upon
the
board
and
lighted
up
troy
town
on
dusky
wings
came
flying
the
place
and
seeing
psyche
with
her
happy
face
asleep
beneath
some
fair
tree
blossoming
into
her
sleep
straight
cast
an
evil
thing
whereby
she
dreamed
she
saw
her
father
laid
panting
for
breath
beneath
the
golden
shade
of
his
great
bed
embroidered
canopy
and
with
his
last
breath
moaning
heavily
her
name
and
fancied
woes
thereat
she
woke
and
this
ill
dream
through
all
her
quiet
broke
and
when
next
morn
her
love
from
her
would
go
and
going
as
it
was
his
wont
to
do
would
kiss
her
sleeping
he
must
find
the
tears
filling
the
hollows
of
her
rosy
ears
and
wetting
half
the
golden
hair
that
lay
twixt
him
and
her
then
did
he
speak
and
say
o
love
why
dost
thou
lie
awake
and
weep
who
for
content
shouldst
have
good
heart
to
sleep
this
cold
hour
ere
the
dawning
nought
she
said
but
wept
aloud
then
cried
he
by
my
head
thou
wishest
i
will
do
for
thee
yea
if
it
make
an
end
of
thee
and
me
o
love
she
said
i
scarce
dare
ask
again
yet
is
there
in
mine
heart
an
aching
pain
to
know
what
of
my
father
is
become
so
would
i
send
my
sisters
to
my
home
because
i
doubt
indeed
they
never
told
of
all
my
honour
in
this
house
of
gold
and
now
of
them
a
great
oath
would
i
take
he
said
alas
and
hast
thou
been
awake
for
them
indeed
who
in
my
arms
asleep
mightst
well
have
been
for
their
sakes
didst
thou
weep
who
mightst
have
smiled
to
feel
my
kiss
on
thee
yet
as
thou
wishest
once
more
shall
it
be
because
my
oath
constrains
me
and
thy
tears
and
yet
again
beware
and
make
these
fears
of
none
avail
nor
waver
any
more
i
pray
thee
for
already
to
the
shore
of
all
delights
and
joys
thou
drawest
nigh
he
spoke
and
from
the
chamber
straight
did
fly
to
highest
heaven
and
going
softly
then
wearied
the
father
of
all
gods
and
men
with
prayers
for
psyche
immortality
meantime
went
zephyrus
across
the
sea
to
bring
her
sisters
to
her
arms
again
though
of
that
message
little
was
he
fain
knowing
their
malice
and
their
cankered
hearts
for
now
these
two
had
thought
upon
their
parts
and
made
up
a
false
tale
for
psyche
ear
for
when
awaked
to
her
they
drew
anear
sobbing
their
faces
in
their
hands
they
hid
nor
when
she
asked
them
why
this
thing
they
did
would
answer
aught
till
trembling
psyche
said
nay
nay
what
is
it
is
our
father
dead
or
do
ye
weep
these
tears
for
shame
that
ye
have
told
him
not
of
my
felicity
to
make
me
weep
amidst
my
bliss
be
comforted
for
short
the
highway
is
to
my
forgiveness
this
day
shall
ye
go
and
take
him
gifts
and
tell
him
all
ye
know
of
this
my
unexpected
happy
lot
amidst
fresh
sobs
one
said
we
told
him
not
but
by
good
counsel
did
we
hide
the
thing
deeming
it
well
that
he
should
feel
the
sting
for
once
than
for
awhile
be
glad
again
and
after
come
to
suffer
double
pain
alas
what
mean
you
sister
psyche
said
for
terror
waxing
pale
as
are
the
dead
o
sister
speak
child
by
this
loving
kiss
spake
one
of
them
and
that
remembered
bliss
we
dwelt
in
when
our
mother
was
alive
or
ever
we
began
with
ills
to
strive
by
all
the
hope
thou
hast
to
see
again
our
aged
father
and
to
soothe
his
pain
i
charge
thee
tell
me
hast
thou
seen
the
thing
thou
callest
husband
breathless
quivering
psyche
cried
out
alas
what
sayest
thou
what
riddles
wilt
thou
speak
unto
me
now
alas
she
said
then
is
it
as
i
thought
sister
in
dreadful
places
have
we
sought
to
learn
about
thy
case
and
thus
we
found
a
wise
man
dwelling
underneath
the
ground
in
a
dark
awful
cave
he
told
to
us
a
horrid
tale
thereof
and
piteous
that
thou
wert
wedded
to
an
evil
thing
a
fiend
of
poisonous
sting
bestial
of
form
yet
therewith
lacking
not
such
a
soul
as
wicked
men
have
got
thus
ages
long
agone
the
gods
made
him
and
set
him
in
a
lake
hereby
to
swim
but
every
hundred
years
he
hath
this
grace
that
he
may
change
within
this
golden
place
into
a
fair
young
man
by
night
alone
alas
my
sister
thou
hast
cause
to
groan
what
sayest
thou
words
are
fair
and
soft
raineth
loving
kisses
on
me
oft
for
love
he
tells
me
of
a
from
this
place
we
both
shall
go
away
he
shall
kiss
me
then
no
more
unseen
while
i
sit
by
him
a
glorious
alas
poor
child
it
pleaseth
thee
his
kiss
then
must
i
show
thee
why
he
doeth
this
because
he
willeth
for
a
time
to
save
thy
body
wretched
one
that
he
may
have
both
child
and
mother
for
his
watery
hell
ah
what
a
tale
this
is
for
me
to
tell
thou
prayest
us
to
save
thee
and
we
can
since
for
nought
else
we
sought
that
wise
old
man
who
for
great
gifts
and
seeing
that
of
kings
we
both
were
come
has
told
us
all
these
things
and
given
us
a
fair
lamp
of
hallowed
oil
that
he
has
wrought
with
danger
and
much
toil
and
thereto
has
he
added
a
sharp
knife
in
forging
which
he
lost
his
life
about
him
so
the
devils
of
the
pit
came
swarming
o
my
sister
hast
thou
it
straight
from
her
gown
the
other
one
drew
out
the
lamp
and
knife
which
psyche
dumb
with
doubt
and
misery
at
once
took
in
her
hand
then
said
her
sister
from
this
doubtful
land
thou
us
royal
gifts
a
while
ago
but
these
we
give
thee
though
they
lack
for
show
shall
be
to
thee
a
better
gift
thy
life
put
now
in
some
sure
place
this
lamp
and
knife
and
when
he
sleeps
rise
silently
from
bed
and
hold
the
hallowed
lamp
above
his
head
and
swiftly
draw
the
charméd
knife
across
his
cursed
neck
thou
well
bear
the
loss
nor
shall
he
keep
his
man
shape
more
when
he
first
feels
the
iron
wrought
so
mysticly
but
thou
flee
unto
us
we
have
a
tale
of
what
has
been
thy
lot
within
this
vale
when
we
have
therefrom
which
we
shall
do
by
virtue
of
strange
spells
the
old
man
knew
farewell
sweet
sister
here
we
may
not
stay
lest
in
returning
he
should
pass
this
way
but
in
the
vale
we
will
not
fail
to
wait
till
thou
art
loosened
from
thine
evil
fate
thus
went
they
and
for
long
they
said
not
aught
fearful
lest
any
should
surprise
their
thought
but
in
such
wise
had
envy
conquered
fear
that
they
were
fain
that
eve
to
bide
anear
their
sister
ruined
home
but
when
they
came
unto
the
river
on
them
fell
the
same
resistless
languor
they
had
felt
before
and
from
the
blossoms
of
that
flowery
shore
their
sleeping
bodies
soon
did
zephyr
bear
for
other
folk
to
hatch
new
ills
and
care
but
on
the
ground
sat
psyche
all
alone
the
lamp
and
knife
beside
her
and
no
moan
she
made
but
silent
let
the
long
hours
go
till
dark
night
closed
around
her
and
her
woe
then
trembling
she
arose
for
now
drew
near
the
time
of
utter
loneliness
and
fear
and
she
must
think
of
death
who
until
now
had
thought
of
ruined
life
and
love
brought
low
and
with
that
thought
tormenting
doubt
there
came
and
images
of
some
shame
until
forlorn
entrapped
of
gods
she
felt
as
though
in
some
strange
hell
her
spirit
dwelt
yet
driven
by
her
sisters
words
at
last
and
by
remembrance
of
the
time
now
past
when
she
stood
trembling
as
the
oracle
with
all
its
fearful
doom
upon
her
fell
she
to
her
hapless
turned
and
while
the
waxen
tapers
freshly
burned
she
laid
those
dread
gifts
ready
to
her
hand
then
quenched
the
lights
and
by
the
bed
did
stand
turning
these
matters
in
her
troubled
mind
and
sometimes
hoped
some
glorious
man
to
find
beneath
the
lamp
fit
bridegroom
for
a
bride
like
her
ah
then
with
what
joy
to
his
side
would
she
creep
back
in
the
dark
silent
night
but
whiles
she
quaked
at
thought
of
what
a
sight
the
lamp
might
show
her
the
hot
rush
of
blood
the
knife
might
shed
upon
her
as
she
stood
the
dread
of
some
pursuit
the
hurrying
out
through
rooms
where
every
sound
would
seem
a
shout
into
the
windy
night
among
the
trees
where
many
a
changing
monstrous
sight
one
sees
when
nought
at
all
has
happed
to
chill
the
blood
but
as
among
these
evil
thoughts
she
stood
she
heard
him
coming
and
straight
crept
to
bed
and
felt
him
touch
her
with
a
dread
and
durst
not
answer
to
his
words
of
love
but
when
he
slept
she
rose
that
tale
to
prove
and
sliding
down
as
softly
as
might
be
and
moving
through
the
chamber
quietly
she
gat
the
lamp
within
her
trembling
hand
and
long
debating
of
these
things
did
stand
in
that
thick
darkness
till
she
seemed
to
be
a
dweller
in
some
black
eternity
and
what
she
once
had
called
the
world
did
seem
a
hollow
void
a
colourless
mad
dream
for
she
felt
so
alone
three
times
in
vain
she
moved
her
heavy
hand
three
times
again
it
fell
adown
at
last
throughout
the
place
its
flame
glared
lighting
up
her
woeful
face
whose
eyes
the
silken
carpet
did
but
meet
grown
strange
and
awful
and
her
own
wan
feet
as
toward
the
bed
she
stole
but
come
thereto
back
with
dosed
eyes
and
quivering
lips
she
threw
her
lovely
head
and
strove
to
think
of
it
while
images
of
fearful
things
did
flit
before
her
eyes
thus
raising
up
the
hand
that
bore
the
lamp
one
moment
did
she
stand
as
man
time
tells
it
and
then
suddenly
opened
her
eyes
but
scarce
kept
back
a
cry
at
what
she
saw
for
there
before
her
lay
the
very
love
brighter
than
dawn
of
day
and
as
he
lay
there
smiling
her
own
name
his
gentle
lips
in
sleep
began
to
frame
and
as
to
touch
her
face
his
hand
did
move
o
then
indeed
her
faint
heart
swelled
for
love
and
she
began
to
sob
and
tears
fell
fast
upon
the
but
as
she
turned
at
last
to
quench
the
lamp
there
happed
a
little
thing
that
quenched
her
new
delight
for
flickering
the
treacherous
flame
cast
on
his
shoulder
fair
a
burning
drop
he
woke
and
seeing
her
there
the
meaning
of
that
sad
sight
knew
full
well
nor
was
there
need
the
piteous
tale
to
tell
then
on
her
knees
she
fell
with
a
great
cry
for
in
his
face
she
saw
the
thunder
nigh
and
she
began
to
know
what
she
had
done
and
saw
herself
henceforth
unloved
alone
pass
onward
to
the
grave
and
once
again
she
heard
the
voice
she
now
must
love
in
vain
ah
has
it
come
to
pass
and
hast
thou
lost
a
life
of
love
and
must
thou
still
be
tossed
one
moment
in
the
sun
night
and
night
and
must
i
lose
what
would
have
been
delight
untasted
yet
amidst
immortal
bliss
to
wed
a
soul
made
worthy
of
my
kiss
set
in
a
frame
so
wonderfully
made
o
wavering
heart
farewell
be
not
afraid
that
i
with
fire
will
burn
thy
body
fair
or
cast
thy
sweet
limbs
piecemeal
through
the
air
the
fates
shall
work
thy
punishment
alone
and
thine
own
memory
of
our
kindness
done
alas
what
wilt
thou
do
how
shalt
thou
bear
the
cruel
world
the
sickening
still
despair
the
mocking
curious
faces
bent
on
thee
when
thou
hast
known
what
love
there
is
in
me
o
happy
only
if
thou
couldst
forget
and
live
unholpen
lonely
loveless
yet
but
untormented
through
the
little
span
that
on
the
earth
ye
call
the
life
of
man
alas
that
thou
too
fair
a
thing
to
die
shouldst
so
be
born
to
double
misery
farewell
though
i
a
god
can
never
know
how
thou
canst
lose
thy
pain
yet
time
will
go
over
thine
head
and
thou
mayst
mingle
yet
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
nor
quite
forget
nor
quite
remember
till
these
things
shall
seem
the
wavering
memory
of
a
lovely
dream
therewith
he
caught
his
shafts
up
and
his
bow
and
striding
through
the
chambers
did
he
go
light
all
around
him
and
she
wailing
sore
still
followed
after
but
he
turned
no
more
and
when
into
the
moonlit
night
he
came
from
out
her
sight
he
vanished
like
a
flame
and
on
the
threshold
till
the
dawn
of
day
through
all
the
changes
of
the
night
she
lay
at
daybreak
when
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
she
looked
around
with
heavy
dull
surprise
and
rose
to
enter
the
fair
golden
place
but
then
remembering
all
her
piteous
case
she
turned
away
lamenting
very
sore
and
wandered
down
unto
the
river
shore
there
at
the
head
of
a
green
pool
and
deep
she
stood
so
long
that
she
forgot
to
weep
and
the
wild
things
about
the
from
such
a
silent
thing
cared
not
to
hide
the
dace
pushed
the
stream
the
with
its
wing
went
flickering
by
the
the
lustred
kingfisher
went
on
their
ways
and
took
no
heed
of
her
the
little
reed
birds
never
ceased
to
sing
and
still
the
eddy
like
a
living
thing
broke
into
sudden
gurgles
at
her
feet
but
these
fair
things
on
that
morning
sweet
how
could
she
weary
creature
find
a
place
she
moved
at
last
and
lifting
up
her
face
gathered
her
raiment
up
and
cried
farewell
o
fairest
lord
and
since
i
can
not
dwell
with
thee
in
heaven
let
me
now
hide
my
head
in
whatsoever
dark
place
dwell
the
dead
and
with
that
word
she
leapt
into
the
stream
but
the
kind
river
even
yet
did
deem
that
she
should
live
and
with
all
gentle
care
cast
her
ashore
within
a
meadow
fair
upon
the
other
side
where
shepherd
pan
sat
looking
down
upon
the
water
wan
and
merry
who
called
out
fair
maid
why
goest
thou
hurrying
to
the
feeble
shade
whence
none
return
well
do
i
know
thy
pain
for
i
am
old
and
have
not
lived
in
vain
thou
wilt
forget
all
that
within
a
while
and
on
some
other
happy
youth
wilt
smile
and
sure
he
must
be
dull
indeed
if
he
forget
not
all
things
in
his
ecstasy
at
sight
of
such
a
wonder
made
for
him
that
in
that
clinging
gown
makes
mine
eyes
swim
old
as
i
am
but
to
the
god
of
love
pray
now
sweet
child
for
all
things
can
he
move
weeping
she
passed
him
but
full
reverently
and
well
she
saw
that
she
was
not
to
die
till
she
had
filled
the
measure
of
her
woe
so
through
the
meads
she
passed
half
blind
and
slow
and
on
her
sisters
somewhat
now
she
thought
and
pondering
on
the
evil
they
had
wrought
the
veil
fell
from
her
and
she
saw
their
guile
alas
she
said
can
death
make
folk
so
vile
what
wonder
that
the
gods
are
glorious
then
who
can
not
feel
the
hates
and
fears
of
men
sisters
alas
for
what
ye
used
to
be
once
did
i
think
whatso
might
hap
to
me
still
at
the
worst
within
your
arms
to
find
a
haven
of
pure
love
then
were
ye
kind
then
was
your
joy
as
my
very
own
and
now
and
now
if
i
can
be
alone
that
is
my
best
but
that
can
never
be
for
your
unkindness
still
shall
stay
with
me
when
ye
are
dead
but
thou
my
love
my
dear
wert
thou
not
kind
i
should
have
lost
my
fear
within
a
little
yea
and
just
now
with
angry
godhead
on
thy
lovely
brow
still
thou
wert
kind
and
art
thou
gone
away
for
ever
i
know
not
but
day
by
day
still
will
i
seek
thee
till
i
come
to
die
and
nurse
remembrance
of
felicity
within
my
heart
although
it
wound
me
sore
for
what
am
i
but
thine
for
evermore
thenceforth
her
back
upon
the
world
she
turned
as
she
had
known
it
in
her
heart
there
burned
such
deathless
love
that
still
untired
she
went
the
huntsman
dropping
down
the
woody
bent
in
the
still
evening
saw
her
passing
by
and
for
her
beauty
fain
would
draw
anigh
but
yet
durst
not
the
shepherd
on
the
down
wondering
would
shade
his
eyes
with
fingers
brown
as
on
the
hill
brow
looking
the
lands
she
stood
with
straining
eyes
and
clinging
hands
while
the
wind
blew
the
raiment
from
her
feet
the
wandering
soldier
her
grey
eyes
would
meet
that
took
no
heed
of
him
and
drop
his
own
like
a
thin
dream
she
passed
the
clattering
town
on
the
thronged
quays
she
watched
the
ships
come
in
patient
amid
the
strange
outlandish
din
unscared
she
saw
the
sacked
towns
miseries
and
marching
armies
passed
before
her
eyes
and
still
of
her
the
god
had
such
a
care
that
none
might
wrong
her
though
alone
and
fair
through
rough
and
smooth
she
wandered
many
a
day
till
all
her
hope
had
passed
away
meanwhile
the
sisters
each
in
her
own
home
waited
the
day
when
outcast
she
should
come
and
ask
their
pity
when
perchance
indeed
they
looked
to
give
her
shelter
in
her
need
and
with
soft
words
such
faint
reproaches
take
as
she
durst
make
them
for
her
ruin
sake
but
day
passed
day
and
still
no
psyche
came
and
while
they
wondered
whether
to
their
shame
their
plot
had
failed
or
gained
its
end
too
well
and
psyche
slain
no
tale
thereof
could
amidst
these
things
the
eldest
sister
lay
asleep
one
evening
of
a
summer
day
dreaming
she
saw
the
god
of
love
anigh
who
seemed
to
say
unto
her
lovingly
hail
unto
thee
fair
sister
of
my
love
nor
fear
me
for
that
thou
her
faith
didst
prove
and
found
it
wanting
for
thou
too
art
fair
nor
is
her
place
filled
rise
and
have
no
care
for
father
or
for
friends
but
go
straightway
unto
the
rock
where
she
was
borne
that
day
there
if
thou
hast
a
will
to
be
my
bride
put
thou
all
fear
of
horrid
death
aside
and
leap
from
off
the
cliff
and
there
will
come
my
slaves
to
bear
thee
up
and
take
thee
home
haste
then
before
the
summer
night
grows
late
for
in
my
house
thy
beauty
i
await
so
spake
the
dream
and
through
the
night
did
sail
and
to
the
other
sister
bore
the
tale
while
this
one
rose
nor
doubted
of
the
thing
such
deadly
pride
unto
her
heart
did
cling
but
by
the
tapers
light
triumphantly
smiling
her
mirrored
body
did
she
eye
then
hastily
rich
raiment
on
her
cast
and
through
the
sleeping
passed
and
looked
with
changed
eyes
on
the
moonlit
street
nor
scarce
could
feel
the
ground
beneath
her
feet
but
long
the
time
seemed
to
her
till
she
came
there
where
her
sister
once
was
borne
to
shame
and
when
she
reached
the
bare
cliff
rugged
brow
she
cried
aloud
o
love
receive
me
now
who
am
not
all
unworthy
to
be
thine
and
with
that
word
her
jewelled
arms
did
shine
outstretched
beneath
the
moon
and
with
one
breath
she
sprung
to
meet
the
outstretched
arms
of
death
the
only
god
that
waited
for
her
there
and
in
a
gathered
moment
of
despair
a
hideous
thing
her
traitrous
life
did
seem
but
with
the
passing
of
that
hollow
dream
the
other
sister
rose
and
as
she
might
arrayed
herself
alone
in
that
still
night
and
so
stole
forth
and
making
no
delay
came
to
the
rock
anigh
the
dawn
of
day
no
warning
there
her
sister
spirit
gave
no
doubt
came
nigh
the
soul
to
save
but
with
a
fever
burning
in
her
blood
with
glittering
eyes
and
crimson
cheeks
she
stood
one
moment
on
the
brow
the
while
she
cried
receive
me
love
chosen
to
be
thy
bride
from
all
the
million
women
of
the
world
then
the
cliff
her
wicked
limbs
were
hurled
nor
has
the
language
of
the
earth
a
name
for
that
surprise
of
terror
and
of
shame
now
midst
her
wanderings
on
a
hot
noontide
psyche
passed
down
a
road
where
on
each
side
the
yellow
cornfields
lay
although
as
yet
unto
the
stalks
no
sickle
had
been
set
the
lark
sung
over
them
the
butterfly
flickered
from
ear
to
ear
distractedly
the
kestrel
hung
above
the
weasel
peered
from
out
the
on
her
unafeard
along
the
road
the
trembling
poppies
shed
on
the
burnt
grass
their
crumpled
leaves
and
red
most
lonely
was
it
nothing
psyche
knew
unto
what
land
of
all
the
world
she
drew
aweary
was
she
faint
and
sick
at
heart
bowed
to
the
earth
by
thoughts
of
that
sad
part
she
needs
must
play
some
blue
flower
from
the
corn
that
in
her
fingers
erewhile
she
had
borne
now
dropped
from
them
still
clung
unto
her
gown
over
the
hard
way
hung
her
head
adown
despairingly
but
still
her
weary
feet
moved
on
half
conscious
her
lost
love
to
meet
so
going
at
the
last
she
raised
her
eyes
and
saw
a
grassy
mound
before
her
rise
over
the
yellow
plain
and
thereon
was
a
marble
fane
with
doors
of
burnished
brass
that
the
pillars
set
about
it
burned
so
thitherward
from
off
the
road
she
turned
and
soon
she
heard
a
rippling
water
sound
and
reached
a
stream
that
girt
the
hill
around
whose
green
waves
wooed
her
body
lovingly
so
looking
round
and
seeing
no
soul
anigh
unclad
she
crossed
the
shallows
and
there
laid
her
dusty
raiment
in
the
and
slipped
adown
into
the
shaded
pool
and
with
the
pleasure
of
the
water
cool
soothed
her
tired
limbs
awhile
then
with
a
sigh
came
forth
and
clad
her
body
hastily
and
up
the
hill
made
for
the
little
fane
but
when
its
threshold
now
her
feet
did
gain
she
looking
through
the
pillars
of
the
shrine
beheld
therein
a
golden
image
shine
of
golden
ceres
then
she
passed
the
door
and
with
bowed
head
she
stood
awhile
before
the
smiling
image
striving
for
some
word
that
did
not
name
her
lover
and
her
lord
until
midst
rising
tears
at
last
she
prayed
o
kind
one
if
while
yet
i
was
a
maid
i
ever
did
thee
pleasure
on
this
day
be
kind
to
me
poor
wanderer
on
the
way
who
strive
my
love
upon
the
earth
to
meet
then
let
me
rest
my
weary
doubtful
feet
within
thy
quiet
house
a
little
while
and
on
my
rest
if
thou
wouldst
please
to
smile
and
send
me
news
of
my
own
love
and
lord
it
would
not
cost
thee
lady
many
a
word
but
straight
from
out
the
shrine
a
sweet
voice
came
o
psyche
though
of
me
thou
hast
no
blame
and
though
indeed
thou
sparedst
not
to
give
what
my
soul
loved
while
happy
thou
didst
live
yet
little
can
i
give
now
unto
thee
since
thou
art
rebel
slave
and
enemy
unto
the
queen
this
grace
thou
hast
alone
of
me
to
leave
this
place
free
as
thou
camest
though
the
lovely
one
seeks
for
the
sorceress
who
entrapped
her
son
in
every
land
and
has
small
joy
in
aught
until
before
her
presence
thou
art
brought
then
psyche
trembling
at
the
words
she
spake
durst
answer
nought
nor
for
that
counsel
sake
could
other
offerings
leave
except
her
tears
as
now
tormented
by
the
fears
the
words
divine
had
raised
in
her
she
passed
the
brazen
threshold
once
again
and
cast
a
dreary
hopeless
look
across
the
plain
whose
golden
beauty
now
seemed
nought
and
vain
unto
her
aching
heart
then
down
the
hill
she
went
and
crossed
the
shallows
of
the
rill
and
wearily
she
went
upon
her
way
nor
any
homestead
passed
upon
that
day
nor
any
hamlet
and
at
night
lay
down
within
a
wood
far
off
from
any
town
there
waking
at
the
dawn
did
she
behold
through
the
green
leaves
a
glimmer
as
of
gold
and
passing
on
amidst
an
found
a
pillared
temple
and
round
whose
walls
were
hung
with
rich
and
precious
things
worthy
to
be
the
ransom
of
great
kings
and
in
the
midst
of
gold
and
ivory
an
image
of
queen
juno
did
she
see
then
her
heart
swelled
within
her
and
she
thought
surely
the
gods
hereto
my
steps
have
brought
and
they
will
yet
be
merciful
and
give
some
little
joy
to
me
that
i
may
live
till
my
love
finds
me
then
upon
her
knees
she
fell
and
prayed
o
crown
of
goddesses
i
pray
thee
give
me
shelter
in
this
place
nor
turn
away
from
me
thy
face
if
ever
i
gave
golden
gifts
to
thee
in
happier
times
when
my
right
hand
was
free
then
from
the
inmost
shrine
there
came
a
voice
that
said
it
is
so
well
mayst
thou
rejoice
that
of
thy
gifts
i
yet
have
memory
wherefore
mayst
thou
depart
forewarned
and
free
since
she
that
won
the
golden
apple
lives
and
to
her
servants
mighty
gifts
now
gives
to
find
thee
out
in
whatso
land
thou
art
for
thine
undoing
loiter
not
depart
for
what
immortal
yet
shall
shelter
thee
from
her
that
rose
from
out
the
unquiet
sea
then
psyche
moaned
out
in
her
grief
and
fear
alas
and
is
there
shelter
anywhere
upon
the
green
earth
said
she
or
yet
beneath
it
is
there
peace
for
me
o
love
since
in
thine
arms
i
can
not
rest
or
lay
my
weary
head
upon
thy
breast
have
pity
yet
upon
thy
love
forlorn
make
me
as
though
i
never
had
been
born
then
wearily
she
went
upon
her
way
and
so
about
the
middle
of
the
day
she
came
before
a
green
and
flowery
place
walled
round
about
in
manner
of
a
chase
whereof
the
gates
as
now
were
open
wide
fair
grassy
glades
and
long
she
saw
inside
betwixt
great
trees
down
which
the
unscared
deer
were
playing
yet
a
pang
of
deadly
fear
she
knew
not
why
shot
coldly
through
her
heart
and
thrice
she
turned
as
though
she
would
depart
and
thrice
returned
and
in
the
gateway
stood
with
wavering
feet
small
flowers
as
red
as
blood
were
growing
up
amid
the
soft
green
grass
and
here
and
there
a
fallen
rose
there
was
and
on
the
trodden
grass
a
silken
lace
as
though
crowned
revellers
had
passed
by
the
place
the
restless
sparrows
chirped
upon
the
wall
and
faint
far
music
on
her
ears
did
fall
and
from
the
trees
within
the
doves
still
told
their
weary
tale
unto
their
loves
and
all
seemed
peaceful
more
than
words
could
say
then
she
whose
heart
still
whispered
keep
away
was
drawn
by
strong
desire
unto
the
place
so
toward
the
greenest
glade
she
set
her
face
murmuring
alas
and
what
a
wretch
am
i
that
i
should
fear
the
summer
greenery
yea
and
is
death
now
any
more
an
ill
when
lonely
through
the
world
i
wander
still
but
when
she
was
amidst
those
ancient
groves
whose
close
green
leaves
and
choirs
of
moaning
doves
shut
out
the
world
then
so
alone
she
seemed
so
strange
her
former
life
was
but
as
dreamed
beside
the
hopes
and
fears
that
drew
her
on
till
so
far
through
that
green
place
she
had
won
that
she
a
garden
could
behold
before
a
house
made
beautiful
with
gold
which
to
her
mind
beset
with
that
past
dream
and
dim
foreshadowings
of
ill
fate
did
seem
that
very
house
her
joy
and
misery
where
that
fair
sight
her
longing
eyes
did
see
they
should
not
see
again
but
now
the
sound
of
pensive
music
echoing
all
around
made
all
things
like
a
picture
and
from
thence
bewildering
odours
floating
dulled
her
sense
and
killed
her
fear
and
urged
by
strong
desire
to
see
how
all
should
end
she
drew
yet
nigher
and
the
hedge
beheld
the
heads
of
girls
embraced
by
garlands
fresh
and
orient
pearls
and
heard
sweet
voices
murmuring
then
a
thrill
of
utmost
joy
all
memory
seemed
to
kill
of
good
or
evil
and
her
eager
hand
was
on
the
wicket
then
her
feet
did
stand
upon
new
flowers
the
while
her
dizzied
eyes
gazed
wildly
round
on
mysteries
and
wandered
from
unnoting
face
to
face
for
round
a
fountain
midst
the
flowery
place
did
she
behold
full
many
a
minstrel
girl
while
nigh
them
on
the
grass
in
giddy
whirl
bright
raiment
and
white
limbs
and
sandalled
feet
flew
round
in
time
unto
the
music
sweet
whose
strains
no
more
were
pensive
now
nor
sad
but
rather
a
fresh
sound
of
triumph
had
and
round
the
dance
were
gathered
damsels
fair
clad
in
rich
robes
adorned
with
jewels
rare
or
little
hidden
by
some
woven
mist
that
hanging
round
them
here
a
bosom
kissed
and
there
a
knee
or
driven
by
the
wind
about
some
lily
bowing
stem
was
twined
but
when
a
little
psyche
eyes
grew
clear
a
sight
they
saw
that
brought
back
all
her
fear
a
though
neither
heaven
nor
earth
to
such
a
fair
sight
elsewhere
could
give
birth
because
apart
upon
a
golden
throne
of
marvellous
work
a
woman
sat
alone
watching
the
dancers
with
a
smiling
face
whose
beauty
sole
had
lighted
up
the
place
a
crown
there
was
upon
her
glorious
head
a
garland
round
about
her
girdlestead
where
matchless
wonders
of
the
hidden
sea
were
brought
together
and
set
wonderfully
naked
she
was
of
all
else
but
her
hair
about
her
body
rippled
here
and
there
and
lay
in
heaps
upon
the
golden
seat
and
even
touched
the
gold
cloth
where
her
feet
lay
amid
roses
ah
how
kind
she
seemed
what
depths
of
love
from
out
her
grey
eyes
beamed
well
might
the
birds
leave
singing
on
the
trees
to
watch
in
peace
that
crown
of
goddesses
yet
well
might
psyche
sicken
at
the
sight
and
feel
her
feet
wax
heavy
her
head
light
for
now
at
last
her
evil
day
was
come
since
she
had
wandered
to
the
very
home
of
her
most
bitter
cruel
enemy
yet
must
she
turn
about
to
flee
but
as
her
eyes
back
her
shoulder
gazed
and
with
weak
hands
her
clinging
gown
she
raised
and
from
her
lips
unwitting
came
a
moan
she
felt
strong
arms
about
her
body
thrown
and
blind
with
fear
was
haled
along
till
she
saw
floating
by
her
faint
eyes
dizzily
that
vision
of
the
pearls
and
roses
fresh
the
golden
carpet
and
the
rosy
flesh
then
as
in
vain
she
strove
to
make
some
sound
a
sweet
voice
seemed
to
pierce
the
air
around
with
bitter
words
her
doom
rang
in
her
ears
she
felt
the
misery
that
lacketh
tears
come
hither
damsels
and
the
pearl
behold
that
hath
no
price
see
now
the
gold
that
all
men
worshipped
that
a
god
would
have
to
be
his
bride
how
like
a
wretched
slave
she
cowers
down
and
lacketh
even
voice
to
plead
her
cause
come
damsels
and
rejoice
that
now
once
more
the
waiting
world
will
move
since
she
is
found
the
soul
of
love
and
thou
poor
wretch
what
god
hath
led
thee
here
art
thou
so
lost
in
this
abyss
of
fear
thou
canst
not
weep
thy
misery
and
shame
canst
thou
not
even
speak
thy
shameful
name
but
even
then
the
flame
of
fervent
love
in
psyche
tortured
heart
began
to
move
and
gave
her
utterance
and
she
said
alas
surely
the
end
of
life
has
come
to
pass
for
me
who
have
been
bride
of
very
love
yet
love
still
bides
in
me
o
seed
of
jove
for
such
i
know
thee
slay
me
nought
is
lost
for
had
i
had
the
will
to
count
the
cost
and
buy
my
love
with
all
this
misery
thus
and
no
otherwise
the
thing
should
be
would
i
were
dead
my
wretched
beauty
gone
no
trouble
now
to
thee
or
any
one
and
with
that
last
word
did
she
hang
her
head
as
one
who
hears
not
is
said
but
venus
rising
with
a
dreadful
cry
said
o
thou
fool
i
will
not
let
thee
die
but
thou
shalt
reap
the
harvest
thou
hast
sown
and
many
a
day
thy
wretched
lot
bemoan
thou
art
my
slave
and
not
a
day
shall
be
but
i
will
find
some
fitting
task
for
thee
nor
will
i
slay
thee
till
thou
again
what
thinkest
thou
that
utterly
in
vain
jove
is
my
sire
and
in
despite
my
will
that
thou
canst
mock
me
with
thy
beauty
still
come
forth
o
punish
this
new
slave
that
she
henceforth
a
humble
heart
may
have
all
round
about
the
damsels
in
a
ring
were
drawn
to
see
the
ending
of
the
thing
and
now
as
psyche
eyes
stared
wildly
round
no
help
in
any
face
of
them
she
found
as
from
the
fair
and
dreadful
face
she
turned
in
whose
grey
eyes
such
steadfast
anger
burned
yet
midst
her
agony
she
scarcely
knew
what
thing
it
was
the
goddess
bade
them
do
and
all
the
pageant
like
a
dreadful
dream
hopeless
and
grew
to
seem
yea
when
the
through
the
crowd
did
break
girls
like
to
those
whose
squadron
shake
the
echoing
surface
of
the
asian
plain
and
when
she
saw
their
threatening
hands
in
vain
she
strove
to
speak
so
like
a
dream
it
was
so
like
a
dream
that
this
should
come
to
pass
and
her
feet
the
green
earth
opened
not
but
when
her
breaking
heart
again
waxed
hot
with
dreadful
thoughts
and
prayers
unspeakable
as
all
their
bitter
torment
on
her
fell
when
she
her
own
voice
heard
nor
knew
its
sound
and
like
red
flame
she
saw
the
trees
and
ground
then
first
she
seemed
to
know
what
misery
to
helpless
folk
upon
the
earth
can
be
but
while
beneath
the
many
moving
feet
the
small
crushed
flowers
sent
up
their
odour
sweet
above
sat
venus
calm
and
very
fair
her
white
limbs
bared
of
all
her
golden
hair
into
her
heart
all
wrath
cast
back
again
as
on
the
terror
and
the
helpless
pain
she
gazed
with
gentle
eyes
and
unmoved
smile
such
as
in
cyprus
the
fair
blossomed
isle
when
on
the
altar
in
the
summer
night
they
pile
the
roses
up
for
her
delight
men
see
within
their
hearts
and
long
that
they
unto
her
very
body
there
might
pray
at
last
to
them
some
dainty
sign
she
made
to
hold
their
cruel
hands
and
therewith
bade
to
bear
her
slave
new
gained
from
out
her
sight
and
keep
her
safely
till
the
morrow
light
so
her
across
the
sunny
sward
they
led
with
fainting
limbs
and
heavy
downcast
head
and
into
some
nigh
lightless
prison
cast
to
brood
alone
happy
days
long
past
and
all
the
dreadful
times
that
yet
should
be
but
she
being
gone
one
moment
pensively
the
goddess
did
the
distant
hills
behold
then
bade
her
girls
bind
up
her
hair
of
gold
and
veil
her
breast
the
very
forge
of
love
with
raiment
that
no
earthly
shuttle
wove
and
the
hard
earth
arm
her
lovely
feet
then
she
went
forth
some
shepherd
king
to
meet
deep
in
the
hollow
of
a
shaded
vale
to
make
his
woes
a
tale
but
over
psyche
hapless
and
forlorn
unseen
the
sun
rose
on
the
morrow
morn
nor
knew
she
aught
about
the
death
of
night
until
her
gaoler
torches
filled
with
light
the
dreary
place
blinding
her
unused
eyes
and
she
their
voices
heard
that
bade
her
rise
she
did
their
bidding
yet
grown
faint
and
pale
she
shrank
away
and
strove
her
arms
to
veil
in
her
gown
bosom
and
to
hide
from
them
her
little
feet
within
her
garment
hem
but
mocking
her
they
brought
her
thence
away
and
led
her
forth
into
the
light
of
day
and
brought
her
to
a
marble
cloister
fair
where
sat
the
queen
on
her
adornéd
chair
but
she
as
down
the
place
they
came
cried
out
haste
ye
who
lead
my
grief
and
shame
and
when
she
stood
before
her
trembling
said
although
within
a
palace
thou
wast
bred
yet
dost
thou
carry
but
a
slavish
heart
and
fitting
is
it
thou
shouldst
learn
thy
part
and
know
the
state
whereunto
thou
art
brought
now
heed
what
yesterday
thy
folly
taught
and
set
thyself
my
will
to
do
ho
ye
bring
that
which
i
commanded
you
then
forth
came
two
and
each
upon
her
back
bore
up
with
pain
a
huge
sack
which
setting
down
they
opened
on
the
floor
and
from
their
hempen
mouths
a
stream
did
pour
of
mingled
seeds
and
grain
peas
pulse
and
wheat
poppies
and
millet
and
coriander
sweet
and
many
another
brought
from
lands
which
mingling
more
with
swift
and
ready
hands
they
piled
into
a
heap
confused
and
great
and
then
said
venus
rising
from
her
seat
slave
here
i
leave
thee
but
before
the
night
these
mingled
seeds
thy
hands
shall
set
aright
all
laid
in
heaps
each
after
its
own
kind
and
if
in
any
heap
i
chance
to
find
an
alien
seed
thou
knowest
since
yesterday
how
disobedient
slaves
the
forfeit
pay
therewith
she
turned
and
left
the
palace
fair
and
from
its
outskirts
rose
into
the
air
and
flew
until
beneath
her
lay
the
sea
then
looking
on
its
green
waves
lovingly
somewhat
she
dropped
and
low
adown
she
flew
until
she
reached
the
temple
that
she
knew
within
a
sunny
bay
of
her
fair
isle
but
psyche
sadly
labouring
all
the
while
with
hopeless
heart
felt
the
swift
hours
go
by
and
knowing
well
what
bitter
mockery
lay
in
that
task
yet
did
she
what
she
might
that
something
should
be
finished
ere
the
night
and
she
a
little
mercy
yet
might
ask
but
the
first
hours
of
that
long
feverish
task
passed
amid
mocks
for
oft
the
damsels
came
about
her
and
made
merry
with
her
shame
and
laughed
to
see
her
trembling
eagerness
and
how
with
some
small
lappet
of
her
dress
she
winnowed
out
the
wheat
and
how
she
bent
over
the
millet
hopelessly
intent
and
how
she
guarded
well
some
tiny
heap
but
just
begun
from
their
long
raiments
sweep
and
how
herself
with
girt
gown
carefully
she
went
betwixt
the
heaps
that
to
lie
along
the
floor
though
they
were
small
enow
when
shadows
lengthened
and
the
sun
was
low
but
at
the
last
these
left
her
labouring
not
daring
now
to
weep
lest
some
small
thing
should
her
blinded
eyes
and
soon
far
off
she
heard
the
echoes
of
their
careless
scoff
longer
the
shades
grew
quicker
sank
the
sun
until
at
last
the
day
was
done
and
every
minute
did
she
think
to
hear
the
fair
queen
dreaded
footsteps
drawing
near
but
love
that
moves
the
earth
and
skies
and
sea
beheld
his
old
love
in
her
misery
and
wrapped
her
heart
in
sudden
gentle
sleep
and
meanwhile
caused
unnumbered
ants
to
creep
about
her
and
they
wrought
so
busily
that
all
ere
sundown
was
as
it
should
be
and
homeward
went
again
the
kingless
folk
bewildered
with
her
joy
again
she
woke
but
scarce
had
time
the
unseen
hands
to
bless
that
thus
had
helped
her
utter
feebleness
ere
venus
came
fresh
from
the
watery
way
panting
with
all
the
pleasure
of
the
day
but
when
she
saw
the
ordered
heaps
her
smile
faded
away
she
cried
out
base
and
vile
thou
art
indeed
this
labour
fitteth
thee
but
now
i
know
thy
feigned
simplicity
thine
inward
cunning
therefore
hope
no
more
since
thou
art
furnished
well
with
hidden
lore
to
thy
due
reward
if
any
day
without
some
task
accomplished
pass
away
so
with
a
frown
she
passed
on
muttering
nought
have
i
done
a
new
thing
so
the
next
morning
psyche
did
they
lead
unto
a
terrace
a
flowery
mead
where
venus
sat
hid
from
the
young
sun
rays
upon
the
fairest
of
all
summer
days
she
pointed
the
meads
as
they
drew
nigh
and
said
see
how
that
stream
goes
glittering
by
and
on
its
banks
my
golden
sheep
now
pass
cropping
sweet
mouthfuls
of
the
flowery
grass
if
thou
o
cunning
slave
art
fain
to
save
thyself
from
pain
put
forth
a
little
of
thy
hidden
skill
and
with
their
golden
fleece
thy
bosom
fill
yet
make
no
haste
but
ere
the
sun
is
down
cast
it
before
my
feet
from
out
thy
gown
surely
thy
labour
is
but
light
then
sadly
went
poor
psyche
on
her
way
wondering
wherein
the
snare
lay
for
she
knew
no
easy
thing
it
was
she
had
to
do
nor
had
she
failed
indeed
to
note
the
smile
wherewith
the
goddess
praised
her
for
the
guile
that
she
unhappy
lacked
so
utterly
amidst
these
thoughts
she
crossed
the
flowery
lea
and
came
unto
the
glittering
river
side
and
seeing
it
was
neither
deep
nor
wide
she
drew
her
sandals
off
and
to
the
knee
girt
up
her
gown
and
by
a
went
down
into
the
water
and
but
sank
up
to
therein
but
from
the
bank
she
scarce
had
gone
three
steps
before
a
voice
called
out
to
her
stay
psyche
and
rejoice
that
i
am
here
to
help
thee
a
poor
reed
the
soother
of
the
loving
hearts
that
bleed
the
pourer
forth
of
notes
that
oft
have
made
the
weak
man
strong
and
the
rash
man
afraid
sweet
child
when
by
me
now
thy
dear
foot
trod
i
knew
thee
for
the
loved
one
of
our
god
then
prithee
take
my
counsel
in
good
part
go
to
the
shore
again
and
rest
thine
heart
in
sleep
awhile
until
the
sun
get
low
and
then
across
the
river
shalt
thou
go
and
find
these
evil
creatures
sleeping
fast
and
on
the
bushes
whereby
they
have
passed
much
golden
wool
take
what
seems
good
to
thee
and
ere
the
sun
sets
go
back
easily
but
if
within
that
mead
thou
thy
feet
while
yet
they
wake
an
ill
death
shalt
thou
meet
for
they
are
of
a
cursed
race
bred
by
a
giant
in
a
lightless
place
but
at
these
words
soft
tears
filled
psyche
eyes
as
hope
of
love
within
her
heart
did
rise
and
when
she
saw
she
was
not
helpless
yet
her
old
desire
she
would
not
quite
forget
but
turning
back
upon
the
bank
she
lay
in
happy
dreams
till
nigh
the
end
of
day
then
did
she
cross
and
gather
of
the
wool
and
with
her
bosom
and
her
full
came
back
to
venus
at
the
but
she
afar
off
saw
it
glistering
and
cried
aloud
go
take
the
slave
away
and
keep
her
safe
for
yet
another
day
and
on
the
morning
will
i
think
again
of
some
fresh
task
since
with
so
little
pain
she
doeth
what
the
gods
find
hard
enow
for
since
the
winds
were
pleased
this
waif
to
blow
unto
my
door
a
fool
i
were
indeed
if
i
should
fail
to
use
her
for
my
need
so
her
they
led
away
from
that
bright
sun
now
scarce
more
hopeful
that
the
task
was
done
since
by
those
bitter
words
she
knew
full
well
another
tale
the
coming
day
would
tell
but
the
next
morn
upon
a
turret
high
where
the
wind
kissed
her
raiment
lovingly
stood
venus
waiting
her
and
when
she
came
she
said
o
slave
thy
city
very
shame
lift
up
thy
cunning
eyes
and
looking
hence
shalt
thou
behold
betwixt
these
battlements
a
black
and
barren
mountain
set
aloof
from
the
green
hills
shaped
like
a
palace
roof
ten
leagues
from
hence
it
lieth
toward
the
north
and
from
its
rocks
a
fountain
welleth
forth
black
like
itself
and
floweth
down
its
side
and
in
a
while
part
into
styx
doth
glide
and
part
into
cocytus
runs
away
now
coming
thither
by
the
end
of
day
fill
me
this
ewer
from
out
the
awful
stream
such
task
a
sorceress
like
thee
will
deem
a
little
matter
bring
it
not
to
pass
and
if
thou
be
not
made
of
steel
or
brass
shalt
thou
find
the
bitterest
day
thou
yet
hast
known
and
all
be
sport
and
play
to
what
thy
heart
in
that
hour
shall
endure
behold
i
swear
it
and
my
word
is
sure
she
turned
therewith
to
go
down
toward
the
sea
to
meet
her
lover
who
from
thessaly
was
come
from
some
field
of
war
but
psyche
wandering
wearily
afar
reached
the
bare
foot
of
that
black
rock
at
last
and
sat
there
grieving
for
the
happy
past
for
surely
now
she
thought
no
help
could
be
she
had
but
reached
the
final
misery
nor
had
she
any
counsel
but
to
weep
for
not
alone
the
place
was
very
steep
and
craggy
beyond
measure
but
she
knew
what
well
it
was
that
she
was
driven
to
the
dreadful
water
that
the
gods
swear
by
for
there
on
either
hand
as
one
draws
nigh
are
dragons
ready
for
the
spring
and
many
another
monstrous
nameless
thing
the
very
sight
of
which
is
death
then
the
black
water
as
it
goes
crieth
fly
wretched
one
before
you
come
to
die
die
wretched
man
i
will
not
let
you
fly
how
have
you
heart
to
come
before
me
here
you
have
no
heart
your
life
is
turned
to
fear
till
the
wretch
falls
adown
with
whirling
brain
and
far
below
the
sharp
rocks
end
his
pain
well
then
might
psyche
wail
her
wretched
fate
and
strive
no
more
but
sitting
weep
and
wait
alone
in
that
black
land
for
kindly
death
with
weary
sobbing
wasting
life
and
breath
but
her
head
there
flew
the
bird
of
jove
the
bearer
of
his
servant
friend
of
love
who
when
he
saw
her
straightway
towards
her
flew
and
asked
her
why
she
wept
and
when
he
knew
and
who
she
was
he
said
cease
all
thy
fear
for
to
the
black
waves
i
thy
ewer
will
bear
and
fill
it
for
thee
but
remember
me
when
thou
art
come
unto
thy
majesty
then
straight
he
flew
and
through
the
dragon
wings
went
carelessly
nor
feared
their
clatterings
but
set
the
ewer
filled
in
her
right
hand
and
on
that
day
saw
many
another
land
then
psyche
through
the
night
toiled
back
again
and
as
she
went
she
thought
ah
all
is
vain
for
though
once
more
i
just
escape
indeed
yet
hath
she
many
another
wile
at
need
and
to
these
days
when
i
my
life
first
learn
with
unavailing
longing
shall
i
turn
when
this
that
seemeth
now
so
horrible
shall
then
seem
but
the
threshold
of
her
hell
alas
what
shall
i
do
for
even
now
in
sleep
i
see
her
pitiless
white
brow
and
hear
the
dreadful
sound
of
her
commands
while
with
my
helpless
body
and
bound
hands
i
tremble
underneath
the
cruel
whips
and
oft
for
dread
of
her
with
quivering
lips
i
wake
and
waking
know
the
time
draws
nigh
when
nought
shall
wake
me
from
that
misery
behold
o
love
because
of
thee
i
live
because
of
thee
with
these
things
still
i
strive
now
with
the
risen
sun
her
weary
feet
the
roses
of
the
floor
did
meet
upon
the
marble
threshold
of
the
place
but
she
being
brought
before
the
matchless
face
fresh
with
the
new
life
of
another
day
beheld
her
wondering
for
the
goddess
lay
with
eyes
upon
her
golden
bed
and
when
she
entered
scarcely
turned
her
head
but
smiling
spake
the
gods
are
good
to
thee
nor
shalt
thou
always
be
mine
enemy
but
one
more
task
i
charge
thee
with
now
unto
proserpine
take
thou
thy
way
and
give
this
golden
casket
to
her
hands
and
pray
the
fair
queen
of
the
gloomy
lands
to
fill
the
void
shell
with
that
beauty
rare
that
long
ago
as
queen
did
set
her
there
nor
needest
thou
to
fail
in
this
new
thing
who
hast
the
heart
and
wit
to
bring
this
dreadful
water
and
return
alive
and
that
thou
the
more
in
this
thing
strive
if
thou
returnest
i
will
show
at
last
my
kindness
unto
thee
and
all
the
past
shalt
thou
remember
as
an
ugly
dream
and
now
at
first
to
psyche
did
it
seem
her
heart
was
softening
to
her
and
the
thought
swelled
her
full
heart
to
sobbing
and
it
brought
into
her
yearning
eyes
tears
but
on
her
way
cold
thoughts
and
dreadful
fears
rose
in
her
heart
for
who
indeed
could
teach
a
living
soul
that
dread
abode
to
reach
and
yet
return
and
then
once
more
it
seemed
the
hope
of
mercy
was
but
lightly
dreamed
and
she
remembered
that
triumphant
smile
and
needs
must
think
this
is
the
final
wile
alas
what
trouble
must
a
goddess
take
so
weak
a
thing
as
this
poor
heart
to
break
see
now
this
tower
from
off
its
top
will
i
go
quick
to
proserpine
ah
good
to
die
rather
than
hear
those
shameful
words
again
and
bear
that
unimaginable
pain
which
she
has
hoarded
for
morn
now
is
the
ending
of
my
life
forlorn
o
love
farewell
thou
seest
all
hope
is
dead
thou
seest
what
torments
on
my
wretched
head
thy
bitter
mother
doth
not
cease
to
heap
farewell
o
love
for
thee
and
life
i
weep
alas
my
foolish
heart
alas
my
sin
alas
for
all
the
love
i
could
not
win
now
was
this
tower
both
old
enough
and
grey
built
by
some
king
forgotten
many
a
day
and
no
man
dwelt
there
now
that
bitter
war
from
that
bright
land
had
long
been
driven
afar
there
now
she
entered
trembling
and
afraid
but
her
doubtful
steps
the
dust
long
laid
in
utter
rest
rose
up
into
the
air
and
wavered
in
the
wind
that
down
the
stair
rushed
to
the
door
then
she
drew
back
a
pace
moved
by
the
coolness
of
the
lonely
place
that
for
so
long
had
seen
no
ray
of
sun
then
shuddering
did
she
hear
these
words
begun
like
a
wind
moaning
voice
have
thou
no
fear
the
hollow
words
of
one
long
slain
to
hear
thou
livest
and
thy
hope
is
not
yet
dead
and
if
thou
heedest
me
thou
well
tread
the
road
to
hell
and
yet
return
again
for
thou
must
go
many
a
hill
and
plain
until
to
sparta
thou
art
come
at
last
and
when
the
ancient
city
thou
hast
passed
a
mountain
shalt
thou
reach
that
men
now
call
mount
tænarus
that
riseth
like
a
wall
plain
and
upland
therein
shalt
thou
find
the
wide
mouth
of
a
cavern
huge
and
blind
wherein
there
cometh
never
any
sun
whose
dreadful
darkness
all
things
living
shun
this
shun
thou
not
but
yet
take
care
to
have
three
thy
soul
alive
to
save
and
in
thy
mouth
a
piece
of
money
set
then
through
the
dark
go
boldly
and
forget
the
stories
thou
hast
heard
of
death
and
hell
and
heed
my
words
and
then
shall
all
be
well
for
when
thou
hast
passed
through
that
cavern
blind
a
place
of
dim
grey
meadows
shalt
thou
find
wherethrough
to
inmost
hell
a
path
doth
lead
which
follow
thou
with
diligence
and
heed
for
as
thou
goest
there
thou
soon
shalt
see
two
men
like
peasants
loading
painfully
a
fallen
ass
these
unto
thee
will
call
to
help
them
but
give
thou
no
heed
at
all
but
pass
them
swiftly
and
then
soon
again
within
a
shed
three
crones
shalt
thou
see
plain
busily
weaving
who
shall
bid
thee
leave
the
road
and
fill
their
shuttles
while
they
weave
but
slacken
not
thy
steps
for
all
their
prayers
for
these
are
shadows
only
and
set
snares
at
last
thou
comest
to
a
water
wan
and
at
the
bank
shall
be
the
ferryman
surly
and
grey
and
when
he
asketh
thee
of
money
for
thy
passage
hastily
show
him
thy
mouth
and
straight
from
off
thy
lip
the
money
he
will
take
and
in
his
ship
embark
thee
and
set
forward
but
beware
for
on
thy
passage
is
another
snare
from
out
the
waves
a
grisly
head
shall
come
most
like
thy
father
thou
hast
left
at
home
and
pray
for
passage
long
and
piteously
but
on
thy
life
of
him
have
no
pity
else
art
thou
lost
also
thy
father
lives
and
in
the
temples
of
the
high
gods
gives
great
daily
gifts
for
thy
returning
home
when
thou
unto
the
other
side
art
come
a
palace
shalt
thou
see
of
fiery
gold
and
by
the
door
thereof
shalt
thou
behold
an
ugly
triple
monster
that
shall
yell
for
thine
undoing
now
behold
him
well
and
into
each
mouth
of
him
cast
a
cake
and
no
more
heed
of
thee
then
shall
he
take
and
thou
pass
into
a
glorious
hall
where
many
a
wonder
hangs
upon
the
wall
but
far
more
wonderful
than
anything
the
fair
slim
consort
of
the
gloomy
king
arrayed
all
royally
shalt
thou
behold
who
sitting
on
a
carven
throne
of
gold
thou
enterest
shall
rise
up
to
thee
and
bid
thee
welcome
there
most
lovingly
and
pray
thee
on
a
royal
bed
to
sit
and
share
her
feast
yet
eat
thou
not
of
it
but
sitting
on
the
ground
eat
bread
alone
then
do
thy
message
kneeling
by
her
throne
and
when
thou
hast
the
gift
return
with
speed
the
sleepy
dog
of
thee
shall
take
no
heed
the
ferryman
shall
bear
thee
on
thy
way
without
more
words
and
thou
shalt
see
the
day
unharmed
if
that
dread
box
thou
openest
not
but
if
thou
dost
then
death
shall
be
thy
lot
o
beautiful
when
safe
thou
again
remember
me
who
lie
here
in
such
pain
unburied
set
me
in
some
tomb
of
stone
when
thou
hast
gathered
every
little
bone
but
never
shalt
thou
set
thereon
a
name
because
my
ending
was
with
grief
and
shame
who
was
a
queen
like
thee
long
years
agone
and
in
this
tower
so
long
have
lain
alone
then
pale
and
full
of
trouble
psyche
went
bearing
the
casket
and
her
footsteps
bent
to
lacedæmon
and
thence
found
her
way
to
tænarus
and
there
the
golden
day
for
that
dark
cavern
did
she
leave
behind
then
going
boldly
through
it
did
she
find
the
shadowy
meads
which
that
wide
way
ran
through
under
a
seeming
sky
grey
and
blue
no
wind
blew
there
there
was
no
bird
or
tree
or
beast
and
dim
grey
flowers
she
did
but
see
that
never
faded
in
that
changeless
place
and
if
she
had
but
seen
a
living
face
most
strange
and
bright
she
would
have
thought
it
there
or
if
her
own
face
troubled
yet
so
fair
the
still
pools
by
the
could
have
shown
the
dimness
of
that
place
she
might
have
known
but
their
dull
surface
cast
no
image
back
for
all
but
dreams
of
light
that
land
did
lack
so
on
she
passed
still
noting
every
thing
nor
yet
had
she
forgotten
there
to
bring
the
and
money
in
a
while
she
saw
those
shadows
striving
hard
to
pile
the
bales
upon
the
ass
and
heard
them
call
o
woman
help
us
for
our
skill
is
small
and
we
are
feeble
in
this
place
indeed
but
swiftly
did
she
pass
nor
gave
them
heed
though
after
her
from
far
their
cries
they
sent
then
a
long
way
adown
that
road
she
went
not
seeing
aught
till
as
the
shade
had
said
she
came
upon
three
women
in
a
shed
busily
weaving
who
cried
daughter
leave
the
beaten
road
a
while
and
as
we
weave
fill
thou
our
shuttles
with
these
endless
threads
for
here
our
eyes
are
sleepy
and
our
heads
are
feeble
in
this
miserable
place
but
for
their
words
she
did
but
mend
her
pace
although
her
heart
beat
quick
as
she
passed
by
then
on
she
went
until
she
could
espy
the
wan
grey
river
lap
the
leaden
bank
wherefrom
there
sprouted
sparsely
sedges
rank
and
there
the
road
had
end
in
that
sad
boat
wherein
the
dead
men
unto
minos
float
there
stood
the
ferryman
who
now
seeing
her
said
o
living
soul
that
thus
among
the
dead
hast
come
on
whatso
errand
without
fear
know
thou
that
penniless
none
passes
here
of
all
the
coins
that
rich
men
have
on
earth
to
buy
the
dreadful
folly
they
call
mirth
but
one
they
keep
when
they
have
passed
the
grave
that
this
stream
a
passage
they
may
have
and
thou
though
living
art
but
dead
to
me
who
here
immortal
see
mortality
pass
stripped
of
this
last
thing
that
men
desire
unto
the
changeless
meads
or
changeless
fire
speechless
she
shewed
the
money
on
her
lip
which
straight
he
took
and
set
her
in
the
ship
and
then
the
wretched
heavy
oars
he
threw
into
the
rowlocks
and
the
flood
they
drew
silent
with
eyes
that
looked
beyond
her
face
he
laboured
and
they
left
the
dreary
place
but
midmost
of
that
water
did
arise
a
dead
man
pale
with
ghastly
staring
eyes
that
somewhat
like
her
father
still
did
seem
but
in
such
wise
as
figures
in
a
dream
then
with
a
lamentable
voice
it
cried
o
daughter
i
am
dead
and
in
this
tide
for
ever
shall
i
drift
an
unnamed
thing
who
was
thy
father
once
a
mighty
king
unless
thou
take
some
pity
on
me
now
and
bid
the
ferryman
turn
here
his
prow
that
i
with
thee
to
some
abode
may
cross
and
little
unto
thee
will
be
the
loss
and
unto
me
the
gain
will
be
to
come
to
such
a
place
as
i
may
call
a
home
being
now
but
dead
and
empty
of
delight
and
set
in
this
sad
place
dark
and
light
now
at
these
words
the
tears
ran
down
apace
for
memory
of
the
once
familiar
face
and
those
old
days
wherein
a
little
child
awe
and
love
beneath
those
eyes
she
smiled
false
pity
moved
her
very
heart
although
the
guile
of
venus
she
failed
not
to
know
but
tighter
round
the
casket
clasped
her
hands
and
shut
her
eyes
remembering
the
commands
of
that
dead
queen
so
safe
to
land
she
came
and
there
in
that
grey
country
like
a
flame
before
her
eyes
rose
up
the
house
of
gold
and
at
the
gate
she
met
the
beast
threefold
who
ran
to
meet
her
but
she
unto
his
jaws
the
cakes
cast
cunningly
but
trembling
much
then
on
the
ground
he
lay
lolling
his
heads
and
let
her
go
her
way
and
so
she
came
into
the
mighty
hall
and
saw
those
wonders
hanging
on
the
wall
that
all
with
pomegranates
was
covered
in
memory
of
the
meal
on
that
sad
shore
whereby
fair
enna
was
bewept
in
vain
and
this
became
a
kingdom
and
a
chain
but
on
a
throne
the
queen
of
all
the
dead
she
saw
therein
with
head
in
royal
raiment
beautiful
and
pale
then
with
slim
hands
her
face
did
psyche
veil
in
worship
of
her
who
said
welcome
here
o
messenger
of
venus
thou
art
dear
to
me
thyself
indeed
for
of
thy
grace
and
loveliness
we
know
in
this
place
rest
thee
then
fair
one
on
this
royal
bed
and
with
some
dainty
food
shalt
thou
be
fed
ho
ye
who
wait
bring
in
the
tables
now
therewith
were
brought
things
glorious
of
show
on
cloths
and
tables
royally
beseen
by
damsels
each
one
fairer
than
a
queen
the
very
latchets
of
whose
shoes
were
worth
the
royal
crown
of
any
queen
on
earth
but
when
upon
them
psyche
looked
she
saw
that
all
these
dainty
matters
without
flaw
were
strange
of
shape
and
of
hues
so
every
cup
and
plate
did
she
refuse
those
lovely
hands
brought
to
her
and
she
said
o
queen
to
me
amidst
my
awe
and
dread
these
things
are
nought
my
message
is
not
done
so
let
me
rest
upon
this
cold
grey
stone
and
while
my
eyes
no
higher
than
thy
feet
are
lifted
eat
the
food
that
mortals
eat
therewith
upon
the
floor
she
sat
her
down
and
from
the
folded
bosom
of
her
gown
drew
forth
her
bread
and
ate
while
with
cold
eyes
regarding
her
anger
and
surprise
the
queen
sat
silent
for
awhile
then
spoke
why
art
thou
here
wisest
of
living
folk
depart
in
haste
lest
thou
shouldst
come
to
be
thyself
a
helpless
thing
and
shadowy
give
me
the
casket
then
thou
not
say
wherefore
thou
thus
hast
passed
the
awful
way
bide
there
and
for
thy
mistress
shalt
thou
have
the
charm
that
beauty
from
all
change
can
save
then
psyche
rose
and
from
her
trembling
hand
gave
her
the
casket
and
awhile
did
stand
alone
within
the
hall
that
changing
light
from
burning
streams
and
shadowy
waves
of
night
made
strange
and
dread
till
to
her
standing
there
the
world
began
to
seem
no
longer
fair
life
no
more
to
be
hoped
for
but
that
place
the
peaceful
goal
of
all
the
hurrying
race
the
house
she
must
return
to
on
some
day
then
sighing
scarcely
could
she
turn
away
when
with
the
casket
came
the
queen
once
more
and
said
haste
now
to
leave
this
shadowy
shore
before
thou
changest
even
now
i
see
thine
eyes
are
growing
strange
thou
on
me
as
the
linnet
looks
upon
the
snake
behold
thy
treasure
take
and
let
thy
breath
of
life
no
longer
move
the
shadows
with
the
memories
of
past
love
but
psyche
at
that
name
with
quickened
heart
turned
eagerly
and
hastened
to
depart
bearing
that
burden
hoping
for
the
day
harmless
asleep
the
triple
monster
lay
the
ferryman
did
set
her
in
his
boat
unquestioned
and
together
did
they
float
over
the
leaden
water
back
again
nor
saw
she
more
those
women
bent
with
pain
over
their
weaving
nor
the
fallen
ass
but
swiftly
up
the
grey
road
did
she
pass
and
now
was
come
into
the
day
by
hollow
tænarus
but
the
way
the
wings
of
envy
brooded
all
unseen
because
indeed
the
cruel
and
fair
queen
knew
well
how
she
had
sped
so
in
her
breast
against
the
which
the
dreadful
box
was
pressed
grew
up
at
last
this
foolish
harmful
thought
behold
how
far
this
beauty
i
have
brought
to
give
unto
my
bitter
enemy
might
i
not
still
a
very
goddess
be
if
this
were
mine
which
goddesses
desire
yea
what
if
this
hold
swift
consuming
fire
why
do
i
think
it
good
for
me
to
live
that
i
my
body
once
again
may
give
into
her
cruel
hands
come
death
come
life
and
give
me
end
to
all
the
bitter
strife
therewith
down
by
the
wayside
did
she
sit
and
turned
the
box
round
long
regarding
it
but
at
the
last
with
trembling
hands
undid
the
clasp
and
fearfully
raised
up
the
lid
but
what
was
there
she
saw
not
for
her
head
fell
back
and
nothing
she
rememberéd
of
all
her
life
yet
nought
of
rest
she
had
the
hope
of
which
makes
hapless
mortals
glad
for
while
her
limbs
were
sunk
in
deadly
sleep
most
like
to
death
over
her
heart
creep
ill
dreams
so
that
for
fear
and
great
distress
she
would
have
cried
but
in
her
helplessness
could
open
not
her
mouth
or
frame
a
word
although
the
threats
of
mocking
things
she
heard
and
seemed
amidst
new
forms
of
horror
bound
to
watch
strange
endless
armies
moving
round
with
all
their
sleepless
eyes
still
fixed
on
her
who
from
that
changeless
place
should
never
stir
moveless
she
lay
and
in
that
dreadful
sleep
scarce
had
the
strength
some
few
slow
tears
to
weep
and
there
she
would
have
lain
for
evermore
a
marble
image
on
the
shadowy
shore
in
outward
seeming
but
within
oppressed
with
torments
knowing
neither
hope
nor
rest
but
as
she
lay
the
phoenix
flew
along
going
to
egypt
and
knew
all
her
wrong
and
pitied
her
beholding
her
sweet
face
and
flew
to
love
and
told
him
of
her
case
and
love
in
guerdon
of
the
tale
he
told
changed
all
the
feathers
of
his
neck
to
gold
and
he
flew
on
to
egypt
glad
at
heart
but
love
himself
gat
swiftly
for
his
part
to
rocky
tænarus
and
found
her
there
laid
half
a
furlong
from
the
outer
air
but
at
that
sight
out
burst
the
smothered
flame
of
love
when
he
remembered
all
her
shame
the
stripes
the
labour
and
the
wretched
fear
and
kneeling
down
he
whispered
in
her
ear
rise
psyche
and
be
mine
for
evermore
for
evil
is
long
tarrying
on
this
shore
then
when
she
heard
him
straightway
she
arose
and
from
her
fell
the
burden
of
her
woes
and
yet
her
heart
within
her
broke
when
she
from
grief
to
happiness
awoke
and
loud
her
sobbing
was
in
that
grey
place
and
with
sweet
shame
she
covered
up
her
face
but
her
dear
hands
all
wet
with
tears
he
kissed
and
taking
them
about
each
dainty
wrist
drew
them
away
and
in
a
sweet
voice
said
raise
up
again
o
psyche
that
dear
head
and
of
thy
simpleness
have
no
more
shame
thou
hast
been
tried
and
cast
away
all
blame
into
the
sea
of
woes
that
thou
didst
bear
the
bitter
pain
the
hopelessness
the
fear
holpen
a
little
loved
with
boundless
love
amidst
them
all
but
now
the
shadows
move
fast
toward
the
west
earth
day
is
done
one
toil
thou
hast
yet
by
sun
kneel
the
last
time
before
my
mother
feet
thy
task
accomplished
and
my
heart
o
sweet
shall
go
with
thee
to
ease
thy
toilsome
way
farewell
awhile
but
that
so
glorious
day
i
promised
thee
of
old
now
cometh
fast
when
even
hope
thy
soul
aside
shall
cast
amidst
the
joy
that
thou
shalt
surely
win
so
saying
all
that
sleep
he
shut
within
the
dreadful
casket
and
aloft
he
flew
but
slowly
she
unto
the
cavern
drew
scarce
knowing
if
she
dreamed
and
so
she
came
unto
the
earth
where
yet
the
sun
did
flame
low
down
between
the
tall
and
red
and
with
its
last
beams
kissed
her
golden
head
with
what
words
love
unto
the
father
prayed
i
know
not
nor
what
deeds
the
balance
weighed
but
this
i
know
that
he
prayed
not
in
vain
and
psyche
life
the
heavenly
crown
shall
gain
so
round
about
the
messenger
was
sent
to
tell
immortals
of
their
king
intent
and
bid
them
gather
to
the
father
hall
but
while
they
got
them
ready
at
his
call
on
through
the
night
was
psyche
toiling
still
to
whom
no
pain
nor
weariness
seemed
ill
since
now
once
more
she
knew
herself
beloved
but
when
the
unresting
world
again
had
moved
round
into
golden
day
she
came
again
to
that
fair
place
where
she
had
borne
such
pain
and
flushed
and
joyful
in
despite
her
fear
unto
the
goddess
did
she
draw
anear
and
knelt
adown
before
her
golden
seat
laying
the
fatal
casket
at
her
feet
then
at
the
first
no
word
the
said
but
looked
afar
over
her
golden
head
pondering
upon
the
mighty
deeds
of
fate
while
psyche
still
as
one
who
well
may
wait
knelt
calm
and
motionless
nor
said
a
word
but
ever
thought
of
her
sweet
lovesome
lord
at
last
the
queen
said
girl
i
bid
thee
rise
for
now
hast
thou
found
favour
in
mine
eyes
and
i
repent
me
of
the
misery
that
in
this
place
thou
hast
endured
of
me
although
because
of
it
thy
joy
indeed
shall
now
be
more
that
pleasure
is
thy
meed
then
bending
on
the
forehead
did
she
kiss
fair
psyche
who
turned
red
for
shame
and
bliss
but
venus
smiled
again
on
her
and
said
go
now
and
bathe
and
be
as
well
arrayed
as
thou
shouldst
be
to
sit
beside
my
son
i
think
thy
life
on
earth
is
done
so
thence
once
more
was
psyche
led
away
and
cast
into
no
prison
on
that
day
but
brought
unto
a
bath
beset
with
flowers
made
dainty
with
a
fount
showers
and
there
being
bathed
in
such
fair
attire
as
veils
the
glorious
mother
of
desire
her
limbs
were
veiled
then
in
the
wavering
shade
amidst
the
sweetest
garden
was
she
laid
and
while
the
damsels
round
her
watch
did
keep
at
last
she
closed
her
weary
eyes
in
sleep
and
woke
no
more
to
earth
for
ere
the
day
had
yet
grown
late
once
more
asleep
she
lay
within
the
west
wind
mighty
arms
nor
woke
until
the
light
of
heaven
upon
her
broke
and
on
her
trembling
lips
she
felt
the
kiss
of
very
love
and
mortal
yet
for
bliss
must
fall
o
for
me
that
i
who
late
have
told
her
woe
and
misery
must
leave
untold
the
joy
unspeakable
that
on
her
tender
wounded
spirit
fell
alas
i
try
to
think
of
it
in
vain
my
lyre
is
but
attuned
to
tears
and
pain
how
shall
i
sing
the
day
led
by
the
hand
of
love
she
took
her
way
unto
a
vale
beset
with
heavenly
trees
where
all
the
gathered
gods
and
goddesses
abode
her
coming
but
when
psyche
saw
the
father
face
she
fainting
with
her
awe
had
fallen
but
that
love
arm
held
her
up
then
brought
the
a
golden
cup
and
gently
set
it
in
her
slender
hand
and
while
in
dread
and
wonder
she
did
stand
the
father
awful
voice
smote
on
her
ear
drink
now
o
beautiful
and
have
no
fear
for
with
this
draught
shalt
thou
be
born
again
and
live
for
ever
free
from
care
and
pain
then
pale
as
privet
took
she
heart
to
drink
and
therewithal
most
strange
new
thoughts
did
think
and
unknown
feelings
seized
her
and
there
came
sudden
remembrance
vivid
as
a
flame
of
everything
that
she
had
done
on
earth
although
it
all
seemed
changed
in
weight
and
worth
small
things
becoming
great
and
great
things
small
and
godlike
pity
touched
her
therewithal
for
her
old
self
for
sons
of
men
that
die
and
that
sweet
immortality
now
with
full
love
her
rested
spirit
fed
then
in
that
concourse
did
she
lift
her
head
and
stood
at
last
a
very
goddess
there
and
all
cried
out
at
seeing
her
grown
so
fair
so
while
in
heaven
quick
passed
the
time
away
about
the
ending
of
that
lovely
day
bright
shone
the
low
sun
over
all
the
earth
for
joy
of
such
a
wonderful
new
birth
or
his
tale
was
done
night
held
the
earth
yea
the
brown
bird
grown
bold
as
sounds
of
mirth
grew
faint
and
scanty
now
his
tale
had
done
and
by
his
mate
abode
the
next
day
sun
and
in
those
old
hearts
did
the
story
move
remembrance
of
the
mighty
deeds
of
love
and
with
these
thoughts
did
hopes
of
life
arise
till
tears
unseen
were
in
their
ancient
eyes
and
in
their
yearning
hearts
unspoken
prayers
and
idle
seemed
the
world
with
all
its
cares
few
words
they
said
the
balmy
odorous
wind
wandered
about
some
to
find
the
young
leaves
rustled
its
gentle
breath
and
here
and
there
some
blossom
burst
his
sheath
adding
unnoticed
fragrance
to
the
night
but
as
they
pondered
a
new
golden
light
streamed
over
the
green
garden
and
they
heard
sweet
voices
sing
some
ancient
poet
word
in
praise
of
may
and
then
in
sight
there
came
the
minstrels
figures
underneath
the
flame
of
scented
torches
passing
the
trees
and
soon
the
dusky
hall
grew
bright
with
these
and
therewithal
they
put
all
thought
away
and
midst
the
tinkling
harps
drank
deep
to
may
through
many
changes
had
the
passed
the
hope
of
summer
oft
had
been
ere
midst
the
gardens
they
once
more
were
met
but
now
the
trees
might
well
forget
the
changeful
agony
of
doubtful
spring
for
summer
pregnant
with
so
many
a
thing
was
at
the
door
right
hot
had
been
the
day
which
they
amid
the
trees
had
passed
away
and
now
betwixt
the
tulip
beds
they
went
unto
the
hall
and
thoughts
of
days
long
spent
gathered
about
them
as
some
blossom
smell
unto
their
hearts
familiar
tales
did
tell
but
when
they
well
were
settled
in
the
hall
and
now
behind
the
trees
the
sun
fall
and
they
as
yet
no
history
had
heard
laurence
the
swabian
priest
took
up
the
word
and
said
ye
know
from
what
has
gone
before
that
in
my
youth
i
followed
mystic
lore
and
many
books
i
read
in
seeking
it
and
through
my
memory
this
same
eve
doth
flit
a
certain
tale
i
found
in
one
of
these
long
ere
mine
eyes
had
looked
upon
the
seas
it
made
me
shudder
in
the
times
gone
by
when
i
believed
in
many
a
mystery
i
thought
divine
that
now
i
think
forsooth
men
own
fears
made
to
fill
the
place
of
truth
within
their
foolish
hearts
short
is
the
tale
and
therefore
will
the
better
now
avail
to
fill
the
space
before
the
night
comes
on
and
unto
rest
once
more
the
world
is
won
the
writing
on
the
image
argument
how
on
an
image
that
stood
anciently
in
rome
were
written
certain
words
which
none
understood
until
a
scholar
coming
there
knew
their
meaning
and
thereby
discovered
great
marvels
but
withal
died
miserably
in
days
of
old
as
by
our
fathers
we
were
told
within
the
town
of
rome
there
stood
an
image
cut
of
cornel
wood
and
on
the
upraised
hand
of
it
men
might
behold
these
letters
writ
percute
hic
which
is
to
say
in
that
tongue
that
we
speak
here
nor
yet
did
any
know
the
cause
why
this
was
written
so
thus
in
the
middle
of
the
square
in
the
hot
sun
and
summer
air
the
and
the
driving
rain
that
image
stood
with
little
pain
for
twice
a
hundred
years
and
ten
while
many
a
band
of
striving
men
were
driven
betwixt
woe
and
mirth
swiftly
across
the
weary
earth
from
nothing
unto
dark
nothing
and
many
an
emperor
and
king
passing
with
glory
or
with
shame
left
little
record
of
his
name
and
no
remembrance
of
the
face
once
watched
with
awe
for
gifts
or
grace
fear
little
then
i
counsel
you
what
any
son
of
man
can
do
because
a
log
of
wood
will
last
while
many
a
life
of
man
goes
past
and
all
is
over
in
short
space
now
so
it
chanced
that
to
this
place
there
came
a
man
of
sicily
who
when
the
image
he
did
see
knew
full
well
who
in
days
of
yore
had
set
it
there
for
much
strange
lore
in
egypt
and
in
babylon
this
man
with
painful
toil
had
won
and
many
secret
things
could
do
so
verily
full
well
he
knew
that
master
of
all
sorcery
who
wrought
the
thing
in
days
gone
by
and
doubted
not
that
some
great
spell
it
guarded
but
could
nowise
tell
what
it
might
be
so
day
by
day
still
would
he
loiter
on
the
way
and
watch
the
image
carefully
well
mocked
of
many
a
and
on
a
day
he
stood
and
gazed
upon
the
slender
finger
raised
against
a
doubtful
cloudy
sky
nigh
noontide
and
thought
certainly
the
master
who
made
thee
so
fair
by
wondrous
art
had
not
stopped
there
but
made
thee
speak
had
he
not
thought
that
thereby
evil
might
be
brought
upon
his
spell
but
as
he
spoke
from
out
a
cloud
the
noon
sun
broke
with
watery
light
and
shadows
cold
then
did
the
scholar
well
behold
how
from
that
finger
carved
to
tell
those
words
a
short
black
shadow
fell
upon
a
certain
spot
of
ground
and
thereon
looking
all
around
and
seeing
none
heeding
went
straightway
whereas
the
finger
shadow
lay
and
with
his
knife
about
the
place
a
little
circle
did
he
trace
then
home
he
turned
with
throbbing
head
and
forthright
gat
him
to
his
bed
and
slept
until
the
night
was
late
and
few
men
stirred
from
gate
to
gate
so
when
at
midnight
he
did
wake
pickaxe
and
shovel
did
he
take
and
going
to
that
now
silent
square
he
found
the
mark
his
knife
made
there
and
quietly
with
many
a
stroke
the
pavement
of
the
place
he
broke
and
so
the
stones
being
set
apart
he
to
dig
with
beating
heart
and
from
the
hole
in
haste
he
cast
the
marl
and
gravel
till
at
last
full
shoulder
high
his
arms
were
jarred
for
suddenly
his
spade
struck
hard
with
clang
against
some
metal
thing
and
soon
he
found
a
brazen
ring
all
green
with
rust
twisted
and
great
as
a
man
wrist
set
in
a
plate
of
copper
wrought
all
curiously
with
words
unknown
though
plain
to
see
spite
of
the
rust
and
flowering
trees
and
beasts
and
wicked
images
whereat
he
shuddered
for
he
knew
what
ill
things
he
might
come
to
do
if
he
should
still
take
part
with
these
and
that
great
master
strive
to
please
but
small
time
had
he
then
to
stand
and
think
so
straight
he
set
his
hand
unto
the
ring
but
where
he
thought
that
by
main
strength
it
must
be
brought
from
out
its
place
lo
easily
it
came
away
and
let
him
see
a
winding
staircase
wrought
of
stone
wherethrough
the
wind
did
moan
then
thought
he
if
i
come
alive
from
out
this
place
well
shall
i
thrive
for
i
may
look
here
certainly
the
treasures
of
a
king
to
see
a
mightier
man
than
men
are
now
so
in
few
days
what
man
shall
know
the
needy
scholar
seeing
me
great
in
the
place
where
great
men
be
the
richest
man
in
all
the
land
beside
the
best
then
shall
i
stand
and
some
palace
have
and
if
my
soul
i
may
not
save
in
heaven
yet
here
in
all
men
eyes
will
i
make
some
sweet
paradise
with
marble
cloisters
and
with
trees
and
bubbling
wells
and
fantasies
and
things
all
men
deem
strange
and
rare
and
crowds
of
women
kind
and
fair
that
i
may
see
if
so
i
please
laid
on
the
flowers
or
mid
the
trees
with
bodies
wandering
there
dwelling
happier
than
the
king
what
lovely
days
may
yet
be
mine
how
shall
i
live
with
love
and
wine
and
music
till
i
come
to
die
and
then
who
knoweth
certainly
what
haps
to
us
when
we
are
dead
truly
i
think
by
likelihead
nought
haps
to
us
of
good
or
bad
therefore
on
earth
will
i
be
glad
a
short
space
free
from
hope
or
fear
and
fearless
will
i
enter
here
and
meet
my
fate
whatso
it
be
now
on
his
back
a
bag
had
he
to
bear
what
treasure
he
might
win
and
therewith
now
did
he
begin
to
go
adown
the
winding
stair
and
found
the
walls
all
painted
fair
with
images
of
many
a
thing
warrior
and
priest
and
queen
and
king
but
nothing
knew
what
they
might
be
which
things
full
clearly
could
he
see
for
lamps
were
hung
up
here
and
there
of
strange
device
but
wrought
right
fair
and
pleasant
savour
came
from
them
at
last
a
curtain
on
whose
hem
unknown
words
in
red
gold
were
writ
he
reached
and
softly
raising
it
stepped
back
for
now
did
he
behold
a
goodly
hall
hung
round
with
gold
and
at
the
upper
end
could
see
sitting
a
glorious
company
therefore
he
trembled
thinking
well
they
were
no
men
but
fiends
of
hell
but
while
he
waited
trembling
sore
and
doubtful
of
his
lore
a
cold
blast
of
the
outer
air
blew
out
the
lamps
upon
the
stair
and
all
was
dark
behind
him
then
did
he
fear
less
to
face
those
men
than
turning
round
to
leave
them
there
while
he
went
groping
up
the
stair
yea
since
he
heard
no
cry
or
call
or
any
speech
from
them
at
all
he
doubted
they
were
images
set
there
some
dying
king
to
please
by
that
great
master
of
the
art
therefore
at
last
with
stouter
heart
he
raised
the
cloth
and
entered
in
in
hope
that
happy
life
to
win
and
drawing
nigher
did
behold
that
these
were
bodies
dead
and
cold
attired
in
full
royal
guise
and
wrought
by
art
in
such
a
wise
that
living
they
all
seemed
to
be
whose
very
eyes
he
well
could
see
that
now
beheld
not
foul
or
fair
shining
as
though
alive
they
were
and
midmost
of
that
company
an
ancient
king
that
man
could
see
a
mighty
man
whose
beard
of
grey
a
foot
over
his
gold
gown
lay
and
next
beside
him
sat
his
queen
who
in
a
flowery
gown
of
green
and
golden
mantle
well
was
clad
and
on
her
neck
a
collar
had
too
heavy
for
her
dainty
breast
her
loins
by
such
a
belt
were
prest
that
whoso
in
his
treasury
held
that
alone
a
king
might
be
on
either
side
of
these
a
lord
stood
heedfully
before
the
board
and
in
their
hands
held
bread
and
wine
for
service
behind
these
did
shine
the
armour
of
the
guards
and
then
the
the
minstrels
clad
in
raiment
meet
and
over
against
the
royal
seat
was
hung
a
lamp
although
no
flame
was
burning
there
but
there
was
set
within
its
open
golden
fret
a
huge
carbuncle
red
and
bright
wherefrom
there
shone
forth
such
a
light
that
great
hall
was
as
clear
by
it
as
though
by
wax
it
had
been
lit
as
some
great
church
at
now
set
a
little
way
aside
six
paces
from
the
daïs
stood
an
image
made
of
brass
and
wood
in
likeness
of
a
knight
who
pointed
the
ruddy
light
a
huge
shaft
ready
in
a
bow
pondering
how
he
could
come
to
know
what
all
these
marvellous
matters
meant
about
the
hall
the
scholar
went
trembling
though
nothing
moved
as
yet
and
for
awhile
did
he
forget
the
longings
that
had
brought
him
there
in
wondering
at
these
marvels
fair
and
still
for
fear
he
doubted
much
one
jewel
of
their
robes
to
touch
but
as
about
the
hall
he
passed
he
grew
more
used
to
them
at
last
and
thought
swiftly
the
time
goes
by
and
now
no
doubt
the
day
draws
nigh
folk
will
be
stirring
by
my
head
a
fool
i
am
to
fear
the
dead
who
have
seen
living
things
enow
whose
very
names
no
man
can
know
whose
shapes
brave
men
might
well
affright
more
than
the
lion
in
the
night
wandering
for
food
therewith
he
drew
unto
those
royal
corpses
two
that
on
dead
brows
still
wore
the
crown
and
midst
the
golden
cups
set
down
the
rugged
wallet
from
his
back
patched
of
strong
leather
brown
and
black
then
opening
wide
its
mouth
took
up
from
off
the
board
a
golden
cup
the
king
dead
hand
was
laid
upon
whose
unmoved
eyes
upon
him
shone
and
recked
no
more
of
that
last
shame
than
if
he
were
the
beggar
lame
who
in
old
days
was
wont
to
wait
for
a
dog
meal
beside
the
gate
of
which
shame
nought
our
man
did
reck
but
laid
his
hand
upon
the
neck
of
the
slim
queen
and
thence
undid
the
jewelled
collar
that
straight
slid
down
her
smooth
bosom
to
the
board
and
when
these
matters
he
had
stored
safe
in
his
sack
with
both
their
crowns
the
jewelled
parts
of
their
rich
gowns
their
shoes
and
belts
brooches
and
rings
and
cleared
the
board
of
all
rich
things
he
staggered
with
them
down
the
hall
but
as
he
went
his
eyes
did
fall
upon
a
wonderful
green
stone
upon
the
laid
alone
he
said
though
thou
art
not
so
great
to
add
by
much
unto
the
weight
of
this
my
sack
indeed
yet
thou
certes
would
make
me
rich
enow
that
verily
with
thee
i
might
wage
of
the
world
to
fight
the
other
half
of
it
and
i
the
lord
of
all
the
world
might
die
i
will
not
leave
thee
therewithal
he
knelt
down
midmost
of
the
hall
thinking
it
would
come
easily
into
his
hand
but
when
that
he
gat
hold
of
it
full
fast
it
stack
so
fuming
down
he
laid
his
sack
and
with
both
hands
pulled
lustily
but
as
he
strained
he
cast
his
eye
back
to
the
daïs
there
he
saw
the
bowman
image
to
draw
the
mighty
bowstring
to
his
ear
so
shrieking
out
aloud
for
fear
of
that
rich
stone
he
loosed
his
hold
and
catching
up
his
bag
of
gold
gat
to
his
feet
but
ere
he
stood
the
evil
thing
of
brass
and
wood
up
to
his
ear
the
notches
drew
and
clanging
forth
the
arrow
flew
and
midmost
of
the
carbuncle
clanging
again
the
forked
barbs
fell
and
all
was
dark
as
pitch
straightway
so
there
until
the
judgment
day
shall
come
and
find
his
bones
laid
low
and
raise
them
up
for
weal
or
woe
this
man
must
bide
cast
down
he
lay
while
all
his
past
life
day
by
day
in
one
short
moment
he
could
see
drawn
out
before
him
while
that
he
in
terror
by
that
fatal
stone
was
laid
and
scarcely
dared
to
moan
but
in
a
while
his
hope
returned
and
then
though
nothing
he
discerned
he
gat
him
up
upon
his
feet
and
all
about
the
walls
he
beat
to
find
some
token
of
the
door
but
never
could
he
find
it
more
for
by
some
dreadful
sorcery
all
was
sealed
close
as
it
might
be
and
midst
the
marvels
of
that
hall
this
scholar
found
the
end
of
all
but
in
the
town
on
that
same
night
an
hour
before
the
dawn
of
light
such
storm
upon
the
place
there
fell
that
not
the
oldest
man
could
tell
of
such
another
and
thereby
the
image
was
burnt
utterly
being
stricken
from
the
clouds
above
and
folk
deemed
that
same
bolt
did
move
the
pavement
where
that
wretched
one
unto
his
foredoomed
fate
had
gone
because
the
plate
was
set
again
into
its
place
and
the
great
rain
washed
the
earth
down
and
sorcery
had
hid
the
place
where
it
did
lie
so
soon
the
stones
were
set
all
straight
but
yet
the
folk
afraid
of
fate
where
once
the
man
of
cornel
wood
through
many
a
year
of
bad
and
good
had
kept
his
place
set
up
alone
great
jove
himself
cut
in
white
stone
but
thickly
overlaid
with
gold
which
saith
my
tale
you
may
behold
unto
this
day
although
indeed
some
lord
or
other
being
in
need
took
every
ounce
of
gold
away
but
now
this
tale
in
some
past
day
being
writ
i
warrant
all
is
gone
both
gold
and
stone
be
merry
masters
while
ye
may
for
men
much
quicker
pass
away
they
praised
the
tale
and
for
awhile
they
talked
of
other
tales
of
balked
and
shame
and
loss
for
men
insatiate
stored
nitocris
tomb
the
niblungs
fatal
hoard
the
treasures
of
the
dead
then
of
how
men
would
be
rememberéd
when
they
are
gone
and
more
than
one
could
tell
of
what
unhappy
things
therefrom
befell
or
how
by
folly
men
have
gained
a
name
a
name
indeed
not
hallowed
by
the
fame
of
any
deeds
remembered
and
some
thought
strange
hopes
and
fears
for
what
shall
be
but
nought
to
dead
men
better
it
would
be
to
give
what
things
they
may
while
on
the
earth
they
live
unto
the
earth
and
from
the
bounteous
earth
to
take
their
pay
of
sorrow
or
of
mirth
hatred
or
love
and
get
them
on
their
way
and
let
the
teeming
earth
fresh
troubles
make
for
other
men
and
ever
for
their
sake
use
what
they
left
when
they
are
gone
from
it
but
while
amid
such
musings
they
did
sit
dark
night
being
come
men
lighted
up
the
hall
and
the
chief
man
for
minstrelsy
did
call
and
other
talk
their
dull
thoughts
chased
away
nor
did
they
part
till
night
was
mixed
with
day
june
o
june
o
june
that
we
desired
so
wilt
thou
not
make
us
happy
on
this
day
across
the
river
thy
soft
breezes
blow
sweet
with
the
scent
of
beanfields
far
away
above
our
heads
rustle
the
aspens
grey
calm
is
the
sky
with
harmless
clouds
beset
no
thought
of
storm
the
morning
vexes
yet
see
we
have
left
our
hopes
and
fears
behind
to
give
our
very
hearts
up
unto
thee
what
better
place
than
this
then
could
we
find
by
this
sweet
stream
that
knows
not
of
the
sea
that
guesses
not
the
city
misery
this
little
stream
whose
hamlets
scarce
have
names
this
lonely
mother
of
the
thames
here
then
o
june
thy
kindness
will
we
take
and
if
indeed
but
pensive
men
we
seem
what
should
we
do
thou
wouldst
not
have
us
wake
from
out
the
arms
of
this
rare
happy
dream
and
wish
to
leave
the
murmur
of
the
stream
the
rustling
boughs
the
twitter
of
the
birds
and
all
thy
thousand
peaceful
happy
words
now
in
the
early
june
they
deemed
it
good
that
they
should
go
unto
a
house
that
stood
on
their
chief
river
so
upon
a
day
with
favouring
wind
and
tide
they
took
their
way
up
the
fair
stream
most
lovely
was
the
time
even
amidst
the
days
of
that
fair
clime
and
still
the
wanderers
thought
about
their
lives
and
that
desire
that
rippling
water
gives
to
youthful
hearts
to
wander
anywhere
so
midst
sweet
sights
and
sounds
a
house
most
fair
they
came
to
set
upon
the
river
side
where
kindly
folk
their
coming
did
abide
there
they
took
land
and
in
the
shade
beneath
the
trees
they
found
the
fair
feast
laid
and
sat
well
pleased
but
when
the
had
got
at
last
to
think
them
harmless
men
and
they
with
rest
and
pleasure
and
old
wine
began
to
feel
immortal
and
divine
an
elder
spoke
o
gentle
friends
the
day
amid
such
calm
delight
now
slips
away
and
ye
yourselves
are
grown
so
bright
and
glad
i
care
not
if
i
tell
you
something
sad
sad
though
the
life
i
tell
you
of
passed
by
unstained
by
sordid
strife
or
misery
sad
because
though
a
glorious
end
it
tells
yet
on
the
end
of
glorious
life
it
dwells
and
striving
through
all
things
to
reach
the
best
upon
no
midway
happiness
will
rest
the
love
of
alcestis
argument
admetus
king
of
pheræ
in
thessaly
received
unwittingly
apollo
as
his
servant
by
the
help
of
whom
he
won
to
wife
alcestis
daughter
of
pelias
afterwards
too
as
in
other
things
so
principally
in
this
apollo
gave
him
help
that
when
he
came
to
die
he
obtained
of
the
fates
for
him
that
if
another
would
die
willingly
in
his
stead
then
he
should
live
still
and
when
to
every
one
else
this
seemed
impossible
alcestis
gave
her
life
for
her
husband
midst
sunny
meads
that
slope
adown
to
lake
boebeis
stands
an
ancient
town
where
dwelt
of
old
a
lord
of
thessaly
the
son
of
pheres
and
fair
clymene
who
had
to
name
admetus
long
ago
the
dwellers
by
the
lake
have
ceased
to
know
his
name
because
the
world
grows
old
but
then
he
was
accounted
great
among
great
men
young
strong
and
godlike
lacking
nought
at
all
of
gifts
that
unto
royal
men
might
fall
in
those
old
simple
days
before
men
went
to
gather
unseen
harm
and
discontent
along
with
all
the
alien
merchandise
that
rich
folk
need
too
restless
to
be
wise
now
on
the
fairest
of
all
autumn
eves
when
midst
the
dusty
crumpled
dying
leaves
the
black
grapes
showed
and
every
press
and
vat
was
newly
scoured
this
king
admetus
sat
among
his
people
wearied
in
such
wise
by
hopeful
toil
as
makes
a
paradise
of
the
rich
earth
for
light
and
far
away
seemed
all
the
labour
of
the
coming
day
and
no
man
wished
for
more
than
then
he
had
nor
with
another
mourning
was
made
glad
there
in
the
pillared
porch
their
supper
done
they
watched
the
fair
departing
of
the
sun
the
while
the
maidens
poured
the
joy
of
life
from
out
the
jars
long
stored
deep
in
the
earth
while
little
like
a
king
as
we
call
kings
but
glad
with
everything
the
wise
thessalian
sat
and
blessed
his
life
so
free
from
sickening
fear
and
foolish
strife
but
midst
the
joy
of
this
festivity
turning
aside
he
saw
a
man
draw
nigh
along
the
dusty
grey
road
that
had
its
ending
at
his
fair
abode
he
seemed
from
afar
to
set
his
face
unto
the
king
adornéd
reverend
place
and
like
a
traveller
went
he
wearily
and
yet
as
one
who
seems
his
rest
to
see
a
staff
he
bore
but
nowise
was
he
bent
with
scrip
or
wallet
so
withal
he
went
straight
to
the
king
high
seat
and
standing
near
seemed
a
stout
youth
and
noble
free
from
fear
but
peaceful
and
unarmed
and
though
ill
clad
and
though
the
dust
of
that
hot
land
he
had
upon
his
limbs
and
face
as
fair
was
he
as
any
king
son
you
might
lightly
see
and
beautiful
of
limb
and
no
ill
eye
the
women
cast
on
him
but
kneeling
now
and
stretching
forth
his
hand
he
said
o
thou
the
king
of
this
fair
land
unto
a
banished
man
some
shelter
give
and
help
me
with
thy
goods
that
i
may
live
thou
hast
good
store
admetus
yet
may
i
who
kneel
before
thee
now
in
misery
give
thee
more
gifts
before
the
end
shall
come
than
all
thou
hast
laid
safely
in
thine
home
rise
up
and
be
my
guest
admetus
said
i
need
no
gifts
for
this
poor
gift
of
bread
the
land
is
wide
and
bountiful
enow
what
thou
canst
do
thou
shalt
show
and
be
my
man
perchance
but
this
night
rest
not
questioned
more
than
any
passing
guest
yea
even
if
a
great
king
thou
hast
spilt
thou
shall
not
answer
aught
but
as
thou
wilt
then
the
man
rose
and
said
o
king
indeed
of
thine
awarded
silence
have
i
need
nameless
i
am
nameless
what
i
have
done
must
be
through
many
circles
of
the
sun
but
for
let
me
rather
tell
on
this
same
eve
what
things
i
can
do
well
and
let
me
put
mine
hand
in
thine
and
swear
to
serve
thee
faithfully
a
changing
year
nor
think
the
woods
of
ossa
hold
one
beast
that
of
thy
tenderest
yearling
shall
make
feast
whiles
that
i
guard
thy
flocks
and
thou
shalt
bear
thy
troubles
easier
when
thou
to
hear
the
music
i
can
make
let
these
thy
men
witness
against
me
if
i
fail
thee
when
war
falls
upon
thy
lovely
land
and
thee
then
the
king
smiled
and
said
so
let
it
be
well
shalt
thou
serve
me
doing
far
less
than
this
nor
for
thy
service
due
gifts
shalt
thou
miss
behold
i
take
thy
faith
with
thy
right
hand
be
thou
true
man
unto
this
guarded
land
ho
ye
take
this
my
guest
find
raiment
meet
wherewith
to
clothe
him
bathe
his
wearied
feet
and
bring
him
back
beside
my
throne
to
feast
but
to
himself
he
said
i
am
the
least
of
all
thessalians
if
this
man
was
born
in
any
earthly
dwelling
more
forlorn
than
a
king
palace
then
a
damsel
slim
led
him
inside
nought
loth
to
go
with
him
and
when
the
cloud
of
steam
had
curled
to
meet
within
the
brass
his
wearied
dusty
feet
she
from
a
carved
press
brought
him
linen
fair
and
a
coat
a
king
might
wear
and
so
being
clad
he
came
unto
the
feast
but
as
he
came
again
all
people
ceased
what
talk
they
held
soever
for
they
thought
a
very
god
among
them
had
been
brought
and
doubly
glad
the
king
admetus
was
at
what
that
dying
eve
had
brought
to
pass
and
bade
him
sit
by
him
and
feast
his
fill
so
there
they
sat
till
all
the
world
was
still
and
the
pillars
their
red
torches
shine
held
forth
unto
the
night
a
joyous
sign
so
henceforth
did
this
man
at
pheræ
dwell
and
what
he
set
his
hand
to
wrought
right
well
and
won
much
praise
and
love
in
everything
and
came
to
rule
all
herdsmen
of
the
king
but
for
two
things
in
chief
his
fame
did
grow
and
first
that
he
was
better
with
the
bow
than
any
olympus
and
the
sea
and
then
that
sweet
melody
he
drew
out
from
the
lyre
and
made
the
circle
round
the
winter
fire
more
like
to
heaven
than
gardens
of
the
may
so
many
a
heavy
thought
he
chased
away
from
the
king
heart
and
softened
many
a
hate
and
choked
the
spring
of
many
a
harsh
debate
and
taught
by
wounds
the
snatchers
of
the
wolds
lurked
round
the
gates
of
less
folds
therefore
admetus
loved
him
yet
withal
strange
doubts
and
fears
upon
his
heart
did
fall
for
morns
there
were
when
he
the
man
would
meet
his
hair
wreathed
round
with
bay
and
blossoms
sweet
gazing
distraught
into
the
brightening
east
nor
taking
heed
of
either
man
or
beast
or
anything
that
was
upon
the
earth
or
sometimes
midst
the
hottest
of
the
mirth
within
the
king
hall
would
he
seem
to
wake
as
from
a
dream
and
his
stringed
tortoise
take
and
strike
the
cords
unbidden
till
the
hall
filled
with
the
glorious
sound
from
wall
to
wall
trembled
and
seemed
as
it
would
melt
away
and
sunken
down
the
faces
weeping
lay
that
erewhile
laughed
the
loudest
only
he
stood
upright
looking
forward
steadily
with
sparkling
eyes
as
one
who
can
not
weep
until
the
storm
of
music
sank
to
sleep
but
this
thing
seemed
the
doubtfullest
of
all
unto
the
king
that
should
there
chance
to
fall
a
festal
day
and
folk
did
sacrifice
unto
the
gods
ever
by
some
device
the
man
would
be
away
yet
with
all
this
his
presence
doubled
all
admetus
bliss
and
happy
in
all
things
he
seemed
to
live
and
great
gifts
to
his
herdsman
did
he
give
but
now
the
year
came
round
again
to
spring
and
southward
to
iolchos
went
the
king
for
there
did
pelias
hold
a
sacrifice
unto
the
gods
and
put
forth
things
of
price
for
men
to
strive
for
in
the
people
sight
so
on
a
morn
of
april
fresh
and
bright
admetus
shook
the
reins
and
soon
from
windings
of
the
lanes
the
south
wind
blew
the
sound
of
hoof
and
wheel
clatter
of
brazen
shields
and
clink
of
steel
unto
the
herdsman
ears
who
stood
awhile
hearkening
the
echoes
with
a
godlike
smile
then
slowly
gat
him
foldwards
murmuring
fair
music
for
the
wooing
of
a
king
but
in
six
days
again
admetus
came
with
no
lost
labour
or
dishonoured
name
a
scarlet
cloak
upon
his
back
he
bare
a
gold
crown
on
his
head
a
falchion
fair
girt
to
his
side
behind
him
four
white
steeds
whose
dams
had
fed
full
in
nisæan
meads
all
prizes
that
his
valiant
hands
had
won
within
the
guarded
lists
of
tyro
son
yet
midst
the
sound
of
joyous
minstrelsy
no
joyous
man
in
truth
he
seemed
to
be
so
that
folk
looking
on
him
said
behold
the
wise
king
will
not
show
himself
too
bold
amidst
his
greatness
the
gods
too
are
great
and
who
can
tell
the
dreadful
ways
of
fate
it
was
he
gat
him
through
the
town
and
midst
their
shouts
at
last
he
lighted
down
at
his
own
house
and
held
high
feast
that
night
and
yet
by
seeming
had
but
small
delight
in
aught
that
any
man
could
do
or
say
and
on
the
morrow
just
at
dawn
of
day
rose
up
and
clad
himself
and
took
his
spear
and
in
the
fresh
and
air
went
wandering
till
he
reach
boebeis
shore
yet
by
his
troubled
face
set
little
store
by
all
the
songs
of
birds
and
scent
of
flowers
yea
rather
unto
him
the
fragrant
hours
were
grown
but
dull
and
empty
of
delight
so
going
at
the
last
he
came
in
sight
of
his
new
herdsman
who
that
morning
lay
close
by
the
white
sand
of
a
little
bay
the
teeming
ripple
of
boebeis
lapped
there
he
in
cloak
of
sheepskin
wrapped
against
the
cold
dew
free
from
trouble
sang
the
while
the
heifers
bells
about
him
rang
and
mingled
with
the
sweet
birds
and
bright
fresh
ripple
listen
then
these
words
will
tell
the
tale
of
his
felicity
halting
and
void
of
music
though
they
be
song
o
dwellers
on
the
lovely
earth
why
will
ye
break
your
rest
and
mirth
to
weary
us
with
fruitless
prayer
why
will
ye
toil
and
take
such
care
for
children
children
yet
unborn
and
garner
store
of
strife
and
scorn
to
gain
a
name
cumbered
with
lies
and
soiled
with
shame
and
if
the
gods
care
not
for
you
what
is
this
folly
ye
must
do
to
win
some
mortal
feeble
heart
o
fools
when
each
man
plays
his
part
and
heeds
his
fellow
little
more
than
these
blue
waves
that
kiss
the
shore
take
heed
of
how
the
daisies
grow
o
fools
and
if
ye
could
but
know
how
fair
a
world
to
you
is
given
o
brooder
on
the
hills
of
heaven
when
for
my
sin
thou
me
forth
hadst
thou
forgot
what
this
was
worth
thine
own
hand
had
made
the
tears
of
men
the
death
of
threescore
years
and
ten
the
trembling
of
the
timorous
race
had
these
things
so
bedimmed
the
place
thine
own
hand
made
thou
couldst
not
know
to
what
a
heaven
the
earth
might
grow
if
fear
beneath
the
earth
were
laid
if
hope
failed
not
nor
love
decayed
he
stopped
for
he
beheld
his
wandering
lord
who
drawing
near
heard
little
of
his
word
and
noted
less
for
in
that
haggard
mood
nought
could
he
do
but
his
sorrows
brood
they
were
but
now
being
come
anigh
he
lifted
up
his
drawn
face
suddenly
and
as
the
singer
gat
him
to
his
feet
his
eyes
admetus
troubled
eyes
did
meet
as
with
some
speech
he
now
seemed
labouring
which
from
his
heart
his
lips
refused
to
bring
then
spoke
the
herdsman
master
what
is
this
that
thou
returned
with
honour
to
the
bliss
the
gods
have
given
thee
here
still
makest
show
to
be
some
wretch
bent
with
the
weight
of
woe
what
wilt
thou
have
what
help
there
is
in
me
is
wholly
thine
for
in
felicity
within
thine
house
thou
still
hast
let
me
live
nor
grudged
most
noble
gifts
to
me
to
give
yea
said
admetus
thou
canst
help
indeed
but
as
the
spring
shower
helps
the
unsown
mead
yet
listen
at
iolchos
the
first
day
unto
diana
house
i
took
my
way
where
all
men
gathered
ere
the
games
began
there
at
the
right
side
of
the
royal
man
who
rules
iolchos
did
his
daughter
stand
who
with
a
suppliant
bough
in
her
right
hand
headed
the
band
of
maidens
but
to
me
more
than
a
goddess
did
she
seem
to
be
nor
fit
to
die
and
therewithal
i
thought
that
we
had
all
been
thither
called
for
nought
but
that
her
bridegroom
pelias
might
choose
and
with
that
thought
desire
did
i
let
loose
and
striving
not
with
love
i
gazed
my
fill
as
one
who
will
not
fear
the
coming
ill
all
foolish
were
mine
eyes
foolish
my
heart
to
strive
in
such
a
marvel
to
have
part
what
god
shall
wed
her
rather
no
more
fear
than
vexes
pallas
vexed
her
forehead
clear
faith
shone
from
out
her
eyes
and
on
her
lips
unknown
love
trembled
the
phoenician
ships
within
their
dark
holds
nought
so
precious
bring
as
her
soft
golden
hair
no
daintiest
thing
i
ever
saw
was
half
so
wisely
wrought
as
was
her
rosy
ear
beyond
all
thought
all
words
to
tell
of
her
veiled
body
showed
as
by
the
image
of
the
bowed
she
laid
her
offering
down
then
i
drawn
near
the
murmuring
of
her
gentle
voice
could
hear
as
waking
one
hears
music
in
the
morn
ere
yet
the
fair
june
sun
is
fully
born
and
sweeter
than
the
roses
fresh
with
dew
sweet
odours
floated
round
me
as
she
drew
some
golden
thing
from
out
her
balmy
breast
with
her
right
hand
the
while
her
left
hand
pressed
the
hidden
wonders
of
her
girdlestead
and
when
abashed
i
sank
adown
my
head
dreading
the
god
of
love
my
eyes
must
meet
the
happy
bands
about
her
perfect
feet
what
more
thou
perchance
what
thing
love
is
kindness
and
hot
desire
and
rage
and
bliss
none
first
a
moment
but
before
that
day
no
love
i
knew
but
what
might
pass
away
when
hot
desire
was
changed
to
certainty
or
not
abide
much
longer
such
stings
had
smitten
me
as
the
first
warm
day
brings
when
march
is
dying
but
now
half
a
god
the
crowded
way
unto
the
lists
i
trod
yet
hopeless
as
a
vanquished
god
at
whiles
and
hideous
seemed
the
laughter
and
the
smiles
and
idle
talk
about
me
on
the
way
but
none
could
stand
before
me
on
that
day
i
was
as
not
knowing
how
the
king
had
brought
her
forth
but
for
a
show
to
make
his
glory
greater
through
the
land
therefore
at
last
victorious
did
i
stand
among
my
peers
nor
yet
one
name
had
gathered
any
honour
from
my
shame
for
there
indeed
both
men
of
thessaly
oetolians
thebans
dwellers
by
the
sea
and
folk
of
attica
and
argolis
arcadian
woodmen
islanders
whose
bliss
is
to
be
tossed
about
from
wave
to
wave
all
these
at
last
to
me
the
honour
gave
nor
did
they
grudge
it
yea
and
one
man
said
a
wise
thessalian
with
a
snowy
head
and
voice
grown
thin
with
age
pelias
surely
to
thee
no
evil
thing
it
was
that
to
thy
house
this
rich
thessalian
should
come
to
prove
himself
a
valiant
man
amongst
these
heroes
for
if
i
be
wise
by
dint
of
many
years
with
wistful
eyes
doth
he
behold
thy
daughter
this
fair
maid
and
surely
if
the
matter
were
well
weighed
good
were
it
both
for
thee
and
for
the
land
that
he
should
take
the
damsel
by
the
hand
and
lead
her
hence
for
ye
near
neighbours
dwell
what
sayest
thou
king
have
i
said
ill
or
well
with
that
must
i
a
fool
stand
forth
and
ask
if
yet
there
lay
before
me
some
great
task
that
i
must
do
ere
i
the
maid
should
wed
but
pelias
looking
on
us
smiled
and
said
neighbour
of
larissa
and
thou
too
o
king
admetus
this
may
seem
to
you
a
little
matter
yea
and
for
my
part
such
a
marriage
would
make
glad
my
heart
but
we
the
blood
of
salmoneus
who
share
with
godlike
gifts
great
burdens
also
bear
nor
is
this
maid
without
them
for
the
day
on
which
her
maiden
zone
she
puts
away
shall
be
her
if
she
wed
with
one
by
whom
this
marvellous
thing
may
not
be
done
for
in
the
traces
neither
must
steeds
paw
before
my
threshold
or
white
oxen
draw
the
wain
that
comes
my
maid
to
take
from
me
far
other
beasts
that
day
her
slaves
must
be
the
yellow
lion
the
lash
must
roar
and
by
his
side
unscared
the
forest
boar
toil
at
the
draught
what
sayest
thou
then
hereto
o
lord
of
pheræ
wilt
thou
come
to
woo
in
such
a
chariot
and
win
endless
fame
or
turn
thine
eyes
elsewhere
with
little
shame
what
answered
i
o
herdsman
i
was
mad
with
sweet
love
and
the
triumph
i
had
had
i
took
my
father
ring
from
off
my
hand
and
said
heroes
of
the
grecian
land
be
witnesses
that
on
my
father
name
for
this
man
promise
do
i
take
the
shame
of
this
deed
undone
if
i
fail
herein
fear
not
o
pelias
but
that
i
shall
win
this
ring
from
thee
when
i
shall
come
again
through
fair
iolchos
driving
that
strange
wain
else
by
this
token
thou
o
king
shalt
have
pheræ
my
home
while
on
the
tumbling
wave
a
hollow
ship
my
sad
abode
shall
be
so
driven
by
some
hostile
deity
such
words
i
said
and
with
my
gifts
hard
won
but
little
valued
now
set
out
upon
my
homeward
way
but
nearer
as
i
drew
to
mine
abode
and
ever
fainter
grew
in
my
weak
heart
the
image
of
my
love
in
vain
with
fear
my
boastful
folly
strove
for
i
remembered
that
no
god
i
was
though
i
had
chanced
my
fellows
to
surpass
and
i
began
to
mind
me
in
a
while
what
murmur
rose
with
what
a
mocking
smile
pelias
stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
the
ring
made
by
my
drunkard
gift
now
twice
a
king
and
when
unto
my
i
came
i
had
awakened
fully
to
my
shame
for
certainly
no
help
is
left
to
me
but
i
must
get
me
down
unto
the
sea
and
build
a
keel
and
whatso
things
i
may
set
in
her
hold
and
cross
the
watery
way
whither
jove
bids
and
the
rough
winds
may
blow
unto
a
land
where
none
my
folly
know
and
there
begin
a
weary
life
anew
eager
and
bright
the
herdsman
visage
grew
the
while
this
tale
was
told
and
at
the
end
he
said
admetus
i
thy
life
may
mend
and
thou
at
lovely
pheræ
still
may
dwell
wait
for
ten
days
and
then
may
all
be
well
and
thou
to
fetch
thy
maiden
home
may
go
and
to
the
king
thy
team
show
and
if
not
then
make
ready
for
the
sea
nor
will
i
fail
indeed
to
go
with
thee
and
the
halyards
and
the
ashen
oar
finish
the
service
well
begun
ashore
but
meanwhile
do
i
bid
thee
hope
the
best
and
take
another
herdsman
for
the
rest
for
unto
ossa
must
i
go
alone
to
do
a
deed
not
easy
to
be
done
then
springing
up
he
took
his
spear
and
bow
and
northward
by
the
to
go
but
the
king
gazed
upon
him
as
he
went
then
sighing
turned
about
and
homeward
bent
his
lingering
steps
and
hope
began
to
spring
within
his
heart
for
some
betokening
he
seemed
about
the
herdsman
now
to
see
of
one
from
mortal
cares
and
troubles
free
and
so
midst
hopes
and
fears
day
followed
day
until
at
last
upon
his
bed
he
lay
when
the
grey
creeping
dawn
had
now
begun
to
make
the
wide
world
ready
for
the
sun
on
the
tenth
day
sleepless
had
been
the
night
and
now
in
that
first
hour
of
gathering
light
for
weariness
he
slept
and
dreamed
that
he
stood
by
the
border
of
a
fair
calm
sea
at
point
to
go
and
to
leave
whatever
from
his
sire
he
did
receive
of
land
or
kingship
and
withal
he
dreamed
that
through
the
cordage
a
bright
light
there
gleamed
far
off
within
the
east
and
nowise
sad
he
felt
at
leaving
all
he
might
have
had
but
rather
as
a
man
who
goes
to
see
some
heritage
expected
patiently
but
when
he
moved
to
leave
the
firm
fixed
shore
the
windless
sea
rose
high
and
to
roar
and
from
the
gangway
thrust
the
ship
aside
until
he
hung
over
a
chasm
wide
vocal
with
furious
waves
yet
had
no
fear
for
all
the
varied
tumult
he
might
hear
but
slowly
woke
up
to
the
morning
light
that
to
his
eyes
seemed
past
all
memory
bright
and
then
strange
sounds
he
heard
whereat
his
heart
woke
up
to
joyous
life
with
one
glad
start
and
nigh
his
bed
he
saw
the
herdsman
stand
holding
a
long
white
staff
in
his
right
hand
carved
with
strange
figures
and
withal
he
said
awake
admetus
loiter
not
but
haste
thee
to
bring
home
thy
promised
bride
for
now
an
ivory
chariot
waits
outside
yoked
to
such
beasts
as
pelias
bade
thee
bring
whose
guidance
thou
shalt
find
an
easy
thing
if
in
thine
hands
thou
holdest
still
this
rod
whereon
are
carved
the
names
of
every
god
that
rules
the
fertile
earth
but
having
come
unto
king
pelias
home
abide
not
long
but
take
the
royal
maid
and
let
her
dowry
in
thy
wain
be
laid
of
silver
and
fine
cloth
and
unmixed
gold
for
this
indeed
will
pelias
not
withhold
when
he
shall
see
thee
like
a
very
god
then
let
thy
beasts
ruled
by
this
carven
rod
turn
round
to
pheræ
yet
must
thou
abide
before
thou
comest
to
the
streamlet
side
that
feed
its
dykes
there
by
the
little
wood
wherein
unto
diana
men
shed
blood
will
i
await
thee
and
thou
shalt
descend
and
afoot
through
pheræ
wend
and
yet
i
bid
thee
this
night
let
thy
bride
apart
among
the
womenfolk
abide
that
on
the
morrow
thou
with
sacrifice
for
these
strange
deeds
may
pay
a
fitting
price
but
as
he
spoke
with
something
like
to
awe
his
eyes
and
face
admetus
saw
and
voiceless
like
a
slave
his
words
obeyed
for
rising
up
no
more
delay
he
made
but
took
the
staff
and
gained
the
where
stood
the
beasts
whose
mingled
whine
and
roar
had
wrought
his
dream
there
two
and
two
they
stood
thinking
it
might
be
of
the
tangled
wood
and
all
the
joys
of
the
trees
but
harmless
as
their
painted
images
some
dread
spell
then
leaping
up
he
took
the
reins
in
hand
and
the
bossed
leather
shook
and
no
delay
the
conquered
beasts
durst
make
but
drew
not
silent
and
folk
just
awake
when
he
went
by
as
though
a
god
they
saw
fell
on
their
knees
and
maidens
come
to
draw
fresh
water
from
the
fount
sank
trembling
down
and
silence
held
the
babbling
wakened
town
so
the
dewy
hedges
did
he
wend
and
still
their
noise
afar
the
beasts
did
send
his
strange
victorious
advent
to
proclaim
till
to
iolchos
at
the
last
he
came
and
drew
anigh
the
gates
whence
in
affright
the
guards
fled
helpless
at
the
wondrous
sight
and
through
the
town
news
of
the
coming
spread
of
some
great
god
so
that
the
scared
priests
led
pale
suppliants
forth
who
in
unmeet
attire
and
boughs
and
smouldering
fire
within
their
censers
in
the
awaited
him
with
many
an
upturned
face
trembling
with
fear
of
that
unnamed
new
god
but
through
the
midst
of
them
his
lions
trod
with
noiseless
feet
nor
noted
aught
their
prey
and
the
boars
hooves
went
pattering
on
the
way
while
from
their
churning
tusks
the
white
foam
flew
as
raging
helpless
in
the
trace
they
drew
but
pelias
knowing
all
the
work
of
fate
sat
in
his
porch
to
wait
the
coming
of
the
king
the
while
the
maid
in
her
fair
marriage
garments
was
arrayed
and
from
strong
places
of
his
treasury
men
brought
fine
scarlet
from
the
syrian
sea
and
works
of
brass
and
ivory
and
gold
but
when
the
strange
yoked
beasts
he
did
behold
come
through
the
press
of
people
terrified
then
he
arose
and
the
clamour
cried
hail
thou
who
like
a
very
god
art
come
to
bring
great
honour
to
my
damsel
home
and
when
admetus
tightened
rein
before
the
gleaming
door
he
cried
to
pelias
hail
to
thee
o
king
let
me
behold
once
more
my
father
ring
let
me
behold
the
prize
that
i
have
won
mine
eyes
are
wearying
now
to
look
upon
fear
not
he
said
the
fates
are
satisfied
yet
wilt
thou
not
descend
and
here
abide
doing
me
honour
till
the
next
bright
morn
has
dried
the
dew
upon
the
corn
that
we
in
turn
may
give
the
honour
due
to
such
a
man
that
such
a
thing
can
do
and
unto
all
the
gods
may
sacrifice
nay
said
admetus
if
thou
me
wise
and
like
a
very
god
thou
dost
me
deem
shall
i
abide
the
ending
of
the
dream
and
so
gain
nothing
nay
let
me
be
glad
that
i
at
least
one
godlike
hour
have
had
at
whatsoever
time
i
come
to
die
that
i
may
mock
the
world
that
passes
by
and
yet
forgets
it
saying
this
indeed
of
pelias
did
he
seem
to
take
small
heed
but
spoke
as
one
unto
himself
may
speak
and
still
the
door
his
eyes
did
seek
wherethrough
from
distant
rooms
sweet
music
came
setting
his
heart
because
amidst
the
lydian
flutes
he
thought
from
place
to
place
his
love
the
maidens
brought
then
pelias
said
what
can
i
give
to
thee
who
so
little
of
divinity
yet
let
my
slaves
lay
these
poor
gifts
within
thy
chariot
while
my
daughter
strives
to
win
the
favour
of
the
spirits
of
this
place
since
from
their
altars
she
must
turn
her
face
for
ever
now
hearken
her
flutes
i
hear
from
the
last
chapel
doth
she
draw
anear
then
by
admetus
feet
the
folk
pile
the
precious
things
but
he
no
less
the
while
stared
at
the
door
ajar
and
thought
it
long
ere
with
the
flutes
mingled
the
maidens
song
and
both
grew
louder
and
the
floor
was
fluttering
with
white
raiment
and
the
door
by
slender
fingers
was
set
open
wide
and
midst
her
damsels
he
beheld
the
bride
ungirt
with
hair
unbound
and
garlanded
then
pelias
took
her
slender
hand
and
said
daughter
this
is
the
man
that
takes
from
thee
thy
curse
midst
women
think
no
more
to
be
childless
unloved
and
knowing
little
bliss
but
now
behold
how
like
a
god
he
is
and
yet
with
what
prayers
for
the
love
of
thee
he
must
have
wearied
some
divinity
and
therefore
in
thine
inmost
heart
be
glad
that
thou
women
such
a
man
hast
had
then
she
with
wondering
eyes
that
strange
team
saw
a
moment
then
as
one
with
gathering
awe
might
turn
from
jove
bird
unto
very
jove
so
did
she
raise
her
grey
eyes
to
her
love
but
to
her
brow
the
blood
rose
therewithal
and
she
must
tremble
such
a
look
did
fall
upon
her
faithful
eyes
that
none
the
less
would
falter
aught
for
all
her
shamefastness
but
rather
to
her
lover
hungry
eyes
gave
back
a
tender
look
of
glad
surprise
wherein
love
flame
began
to
flicker
now
withal
her
father
kissed
her
on
the
brow
and
said
o
daughter
take
this
royal
ring
and
set
it
on
the
finger
of
the
king
and
come
not
back
and
thou
admetus
pour
this
wine
to
jove
before
my
open
door
and
glad
at
heart
take
back
thine
own
with
thee
then
with
that
word
alcestis
silently
and
with
no
look
cast
back
and
ring
in
hand
went
forth
and
soon
beside
her
love
did
stand
nor
on
his
finger
failed
to
set
the
ring
and
then
a
golden
cup
the
city
king
gave
to
him
and
he
poured
and
said
o
thou
from
whatsoever
place
thou
lookest
now
what
prayers
what
gifts
unto
thee
shall
i
give
that
we
a
little
time
with
love
may
live
a
little
time
of
love
then
fall
asleep
together
while
the
crown
of
love
we
keep
so
spake
he
and
his
strange
beasts
turned
about
and
heeded
not
the
people
wavering
shout
that
from
their
old
fear
and
new
pleasure
sprung
nor
noted
aught
of
what
the
damsels
sung
or
of
the
flowers
that
after
them
they
cast
but
like
a
dream
the
guarded
city
passed
and
the
song
of
birds
and
blossoms
scent
it
seemed
for
many
hundred
years
they
went
though
short
the
way
was
unto
pheræ
gates
time
they
forgat
and
gods
and
men
and
fates
however
nigh
unto
their
hearts
they
were
the
woodland
boars
the
yellow
lords
of
fear
no
more
seemed
strange
to
them
but
all
the
earth
with
all
its
changing
sorrow
and
wild
mirth
in
that
fair
hour
seemed
to
the
twain
grief
seemed
a
play
forgot
a
pageant
vain
a
picture
painted
who
knows
where
or
when
with
soulless
images
of
restless
men
for
every
thought
but
love
was
now
gone
by
and
they
forgot
that
they
should
ever
die
but
when
they
came
anigh
the
sacred
wood
there
biding
them
admetus
herdsman
stood
at
sight
of
whom
those
unchecked
stopped
dead
and
little
of
admetus
recked
who
now
as
one
from
dreams
not
yet
awake
drew
back
his
love
and
did
his
wain
forsake
and
gave
the
carven
rod
and
guiding
bands
into
the
waiting
herdsman
outstretched
hands
but
when
he
would
have
thanked
him
for
the
thing
that
he
had
done
his
speechless
tongue
must
cling
unto
his
mouth
and
why
he
could
not
tell
but
the
man
said
no
words
thou
hast
done
well
to
me
as
i
to
thee
the
day
may
come
when
thou
shalt
ask
me
for
a
fitting
home
nor
shalt
thou
ask
in
vain
but
hasten
now
and
to
thine
house
this
royal
maiden
show
then
give
her
to
thy
women
for
this
night
but
when
thou
wakest
up
to
thy
delight
do
all
things
that
should
be
done
nor
of
the
gods
forget
thou
any
one
and
on
the
next
day
will
i
come
again
to
tend
thy
flocks
upon
the
grassy
plain
but
now
depart
and
from
thine
home
send
here
chariot
and
horse
these
gifts
of
thine
to
bear
unto
thine
house
and
going
look
not
back
lest
many
a
thing
thou
to
lack
then
hand
in
hand
together
up
the
road
the
lovers
passed
unto
the
king
abode
and
as
they
went
the
whining
snort
and
roar
from
the
yoked
beasts
they
heard
break
out
once
more
and
then
die
off
as
they
were
led
away
but
whether
to
some
place
lit
up
by
day
or
the
earth
they
knew
not
for
the
twain
went
hastening
on
nor
once
looked
back
again
but
soon
the
minstrels
met
them
and
a
band
of
damsels
flowery
boughs
in
hand
to
bid
them
welcome
to
that
pleasant
place
then
they
rejoicing
much
in
no
long
space
came
to
the
porch
whereon
from
the
passes
of
the
hills
yet
shone
the
dying
sun
and
there
she
stood
awhile
without
the
threshold
a
faint
tender
smile
trembling
upon
her
lips
love
and
shame
until
each
side
of
her
a
maiden
came
and
raised
her
in
their
arms
that
her
fair
feet
the
polished
brazen
threshold
might
not
meet
and
in
admetus
house
she
stood
at
last
but
to
the
women
chamber
straight
she
passed
bepraised
of
all
and
so
the
wakeful
night
lonely
the
lovers
passed
as
they
might
but
the
next
day
with
many
a
sacrifice
admetus
wrought
for
such
a
prize
a
life
so
blest
the
gods
to
satisfy
and
many
a
matchless
beast
that
day
did
die
upon
the
altars
nought
unlucky
seemed
to
be
amid
the
joyous
crowd
that
gleamed
with
gold
and
precious
things
and
only
this
seemed
wanting
to
the
king
of
pheræ
bliss
that
all
these
pageants
should
be
soon
past
by
and
hid
by
night
the
fair
spring
blossoms
lie
yet
on
the
admetus
came
a
haggard
man
oppressed
with
grief
and
shame
unto
the
spot
beside
boebeis
shore
whereby
he
met
his
herdsman
once
before
and
there
again
he
found
him
flushed
and
glad
and
from
the
babbling
water
newly
clad
then
he
with
downcast
eyes
these
words
began
o
thou
whatso
thy
name
is
god
or
man
hearken
to
me
meseemeth
of
thy
deed
some
dread
immortal
taketh
angry
heed
last
night
the
height
of
my
desire
seemed
won
all
day
my
weary
eyes
had
watched
the
sun
rise
up
and
sink
and
now
was
come
the
night
when
i
should
be
alone
with
my
delight
silent
the
house
was
now
from
floor
to
roof
and
in
the
chambers
far
aloof
the
feasters
lay
the
moon
was
in
the
sky
the
soft
spring
wind
was
wafting
lovingly
across
the
gardens
fresh
scents
to
my
sweet
as
troubled
with
the
sound
of
my
own
feet
i
passed
betwixt
the
pillars
whose
long
shade
black
on
the
white
floor
was
laid
so
happy
was
i
that
the
rustling
outside
within
the
flowery
close
seemed
but
love
odorous
wing
too
real
all
seemed
for
such
a
joy
as
i
had
never
dreamed
why
do
i
linger
as
i
lingered
not
in
that
fair
hour
now
to
be
forgot
while
my
life
lasts
upon
the
gilded
door
i
laid
my
hand
i
stood
upon
the
floor
of
the
and
i
saw
the
bride
lovelier
than
any
dream
stand
by
the
side
of
the
gold
bed
with
hands
that
hid
her
face
one
cry
of
joy
i
gave
and
then
the
place
seemed
changed
to
hell
as
in
a
hideous
dream
still
did
the
painted
silver
pillars
gleam
betwixt
the
scented
torches
and
the
moon
still
did
the
garden
shed
its
odorous
boon
upon
the
night
still
did
the
nightingale
unto
his
brooding
mate
tell
all
his
tale
but
risen
my
waiting
love
and
me
as
soundless
as
the
dread
eternity
sprung
up
from
nothing
could
mine
eyes
behold
a
huge
dreadful
coil
that
rolled
in
changing
circles
on
the
pavement
fair
then
for
the
sword
that
was
no
longer
there
my
hand
sank
to
my
side
around
i
gazed
and
the
coils
i
met
her
grey
eyes
glazed
with
sudden
horror
most
unspeakable
and
when
mine
own
upon
no
weapon
fell
for
what
should
weapons
do
in
such
a
place
unto
the
dragon
head
i
set
my
face
and
raised
bare
hands
against
him
but
a
cry
burst
on
mine
ears
of
utmost
agony
that
nailed
me
there
and
she
cried
out
to
me
get
thee
hence
alas
i
can
not
flee
they
coil
about
me
now
my
lips
to
kiss
o
love
why
hast
thou
brought
me
unto
this
alas
my
shame
trembling
away
i
slunk
yet
turning
saw
the
fearful
coil
had
sunk
to
whence
it
came
my
love
limbs
freed
i
saw
and
a
long
breath
at
first
i
heard
her
draw
as
one
redeemed
then
heard
the
hard
sobs
come
and
wailings
for
her
new
accurséd
home
but
there
outside
across
the
door
i
lay
like
a
scourged
hound
until
the
dawn
of
day
and
as
her
gentle
breathing
then
i
heard
as
though
she
slept
before
the
earliest
bird
began
his
song
i
wandered
forth
to
seek
thee
o
strange
man
as
thou
seest
me
weak
with
all
the
torment
of
the
night
and
shamed
with
such
a
shame
as
never
shall
be
named
to
aught
but
thee
yea
yea
and
why
to
thee
perchance
this
ends
all
thou
wilt
do
for
me
what
then
and
have
i
not
a
cure
for
that
lo
yonder
is
a
rock
where
i
have
sat
full
many
an
hour
while
yet
my
life
was
life
with
hopes
of
all
the
coming
wonder
rife
no
sword
hangs
by
my
side
no
god
will
turn
this
cloudless
hazy
blue
to
black
and
burn
my
useless
body
with
his
lightning
flash
but
the
white
waves
above
my
bones
may
wash
and
when
old
chronicles
our
house
shall
name
they
may
leave
out
the
letters
and
the
shame
that
make
admetus
once
a
king
of
men
and
how
could
i
be
worse
or
better
then
as
one
who
notes
a
curious
instrument
working
against
the
maker
own
intent
the
herdsman
eyed
his
wan
face
silently
and
smiling
for
a
while
and
then
said
he
admetus
thou
in
spite
of
all
i
said
hast
drawn
this
evil
thing
upon
thine
head
forgetting
her
who
erewhile
laid
the
curse
upon
the
maiden
so
for
fear
of
worse
go
back
again
for
artemis
now
bars
the
sweet
attainment
of
thy
bliss
so
taking
heart
yet
make
no
more
delay
but
worship
her
upon
this
very
day
nor
spare
for
aught
and
of
thy
trouble
make
no
semblance
unto
any
for
her
sake
and
thick
upon
the
fair
floor
strew
dittany
and
on
each
side
the
door
hang
up
such
as
spring
may
yield
and
for
the
rest
myself
may
be
a
shield
against
her
wrath
nay
be
thou
not
too
bold
to
ask
me
that
which
may
not
now
be
told
yea
even
what
thou
deemest
hide
it
deep
within
thine
heart
and
let
thy
wonder
sleep
for
surely
thou
shalt
one
day
know
my
name
when
the
time
comes
again
that
autumn
flame
is
dying
off
the
overturned
stripped
of
their
wealth
but
now
let
gifts
be
burned
to
her
i
told
thee
of
and
in
three
days
shall
i
by
many
hard
and
rugged
ways
have
come
to
thee
again
to
bring
thee
peace
go
the
sun
rises
and
the
shades
decrease
then
thoughtfully
admetus
gat
him
back
nor
did
the
altars
of
the
huntress
lack
the
fattest
of
the
flocks
upon
that
day
but
when
night
came
in
arms
admetus
lay
across
the
threshold
of
the
and
nought
amiss
that
night
he
noted
there
but
durst
not
enter
though
about
the
door
young
were
twined
and
on
the
floor
not
flowered
as
yet
with
downy
leaves
and
grey
fresh
dittany
beloved
of
wild
goats
lay
but
when
the
whole
three
days
and
nights
were
done
the
herdsman
came
with
rising
of
the
sun
and
said
admetus
now
rejoice
again
thy
prayers
and
offerings
have
not
been
in
vain
and
thou
at
last
mayst
come
unto
thy
bliss
and
if
thou
askest
for
a
sign
of
this
take
thou
this
token
make
good
haste
to
rise
and
get
unto
the
that
lies
below
these
windows
sweet
with
greenery
and
in
the
midst
a
marvel
shalt
thou
see
three
white
poppies
blossoming
though
this
is
but
the
middle
of
the
spring
nor
was
it
otherwise
than
he
had
said
and
on
that
day
with
joy
the
twain
were
wed
and
to
lead
a
life
of
great
delight
but
the
strange
woeful
history
of
that
night
the
monstrous
car
the
promise
to
the
king
all
these
through
weary
hours
of
chiselling
were
wrought
in
stone
and
in
diana
wall
set
up
a
joy
and
witness
unto
all
but
neither
so
would
wingéd
time
abide
the
changing
year
came
round
to
until
at
last
the
day
was
fully
come
when
the
strange
guest
first
reached
admetus
home
then
when
the
sun
was
reddening
to
its
end
he
to
admetus
brazen
porch
did
wend
whom
there
he
found
feathering
a
poplar
dart
then
said
he
king
the
time
has
come
to
part
come
forth
for
i
have
that
to
give
thine
ear
no
man
upon
the
earth
but
thou
must
hear
then
rose
the
king
and
with
a
troubled
look
his
spear
within
his
hand
he
took
and
by
his
herdsman
silently
he
went
as
to
a
peakéd
hill
his
steps
he
bent
nor
did
the
parting
servant
speak
one
word
as
up
they
climbed
unto
his
silent
lord
till
from
the
top
he
turned
about
his
head
from
all
the
glory
of
the
gold
light
shed
upon
the
by
the
setting
sun
for
now
indeed
the
day
was
done
and
all
the
eastern
vale
was
grey
and
cold
but
when
admetus
he
did
now
behold
panting
beside
him
from
the
steep
ascent
one
godlike
look
on
him
he
bent
and
said
o
mortal
listen
for
i
see
thou
deemest
somewhat
of
what
is
in
me
fear
not
i
love
thee
even
as
i
can
who
can
not
feel
the
woes
and
ways
of
man
in
spite
of
this
my
seeming
for
indeed
now
thou
beholdest
jove
immortal
seed
and
what
my
name
is
i
would
tell
thee
now
if
men
who
dwell
upon
the
earth
as
thou
could
hear
the
name
and
live
but
on
the
earth
with
strange
melodious
stories
of
my
birth
phoebus
men
call
me
and
latona
son
and
now
my
servitude
with
thee
is
done
and
i
shall
leave
thee
toiling
on
thine
earth
this
handful
that
within
its
little
girth
holds
that
which
moves
you
so
o
men
that
die
behold
thou
hast
felicity
but
the
times
change
and
i
can
see
a
day
when
all
thine
happiness
shall
fade
away
and
yet
be
merry
strive
not
with
the
end
thou
canst
not
change
it
for
the
rest
a
friend
this
year
has
won
thee
who
shall
never
fail
but
now
indeed
for
nought
will
it
avail
to
say
what
i
may
have
in
store
for
thee
of
gifts
that
men
desire
let
these
things
be
and
live
thy
life
till
death
itself
shall
come
and
turn
to
nought
the
storehouse
of
thine
home
then
think
of
me
these
feathered
shafts
behold
that
here
have
been
the
terror
of
the
wold
take
these
and
count
them
still
the
best
of
all
thine
envied
wealth
and
when
on
thee
shall
fall
by
any
way
the
worst
extremity
call
upon
me
before
thou
to
die
and
lay
these
shafts
with
incense
on
a
fire
that
thou
mayst
gain
thine
uttermost
desire
he
ceased
but
ere
the
golden
tongue
was
still
an
odorous
mist
had
stolen
up
the
hill
and
to
admetus
first
the
god
grew
dim
and
then
was
but
a
lovely
voice
to
him
and
then
at
last
the
sun
had
sunk
to
rest
and
a
fresh
wind
blew
lightly
from
the
west
over
the
and
no
soul
was
there
but
the
sad
dying
autumn
fair
rustled
dry
leaves
about
the
windy
place
where
even
now
had
been
the
godlike
face
and
in
their
midst
the
quiver
lay
then
going
further
westward
far
away
he
saw
the
gleaming
of
peneus
wan
the
white
sky
but
never
any
man
except
a
shepherd
driving
down
from
off
the
long
slopes
to
his
brown
his
woolly
sheep
with
whom
a
maiden
went
singing
for
labour
done
and
sweet
content
of
coming
rest
with
that
he
turned
again
and
took
the
shafts
up
never
sped
in
vain
and
came
unto
his
house
most
deep
in
thought
of
all
the
things
the
varied
year
had
brought
thenceforth
in
bliss
and
honour
day
by
day
his
measured
span
of
sweet
life
wore
away
a
happy
man
he
was
no
vain
desire
of
foolish
fame
had
set
his
heart
no
care
he
had
the
ancient
bounds
to
change
nor
yet
for
him
must
idle
soldiers
range
from
place
to
place
about
the
burdened
land
or
thick
upon
the
ruined
cornfields
stand
for
him
no
trumpets
blessed
the
bitter
war
wherein
the
right
and
wrong
so
mingled
are
that
hardly
can
the
man
of
single
heart
amid
the
sickening
turmoil
choose
his
part
for
him
sufficed
the
changes
of
the
year
the
terror
was
enough
of
fear
for
him
enough
the
battle
with
the
earth
the
autumn
triumph
over
drought
and
dearth
better
to
him
than
battered
shields
poor
dead
corpses
seemed
the
danced
down
beneath
the
moon
until
the
night
grew
dreamy
with
a
shadowy
sweet
delight
and
with
the
moon
came
pensive
thought
and
men
in
love
despite
must
grow
distraught
and
loiter
in
the
dance
and
maidens
drop
their
gathered
raiment
and
the
fifer
stop
his
dancing
notes
the
pensive
drone
that
chid
and
as
they
wander
to
their
dwellings
hid
by
the
black
shadowed
trees
faint
melody
mournful
and
sweet
their
soft
must
be
far
better
spoil
the
gathering
vat
bore
in
unto
the
pressing
shed
than
midst
the
din
of
falling
houses
in
war
waggon
lies
besmeared
with
redder
stains
than
tyrian
dyes
or
when
the
temple
of
the
one
with
glittering
crowns
and
gallant
raiment
shone
fairer
the
maidens
seemed
by
no
chain
bound
but
such
as
amorous
arms
might
cast
around
their
lovely
bodies
than
the
wretched
band
who
midst
the
shipmen
by
the
gangway
stand
each
lonely
in
her
speechless
misery
and
thinking
of
the
worse
time
that
shall
be
when
midst
of
folk
who
scarce
can
speak
her
name
she
bears
the
uttermost
of
toil
and
shame
better
to
him
seemed
that
victorious
crown
that
midst
the
reverent
silence
of
the
town
he
oft
would
set
upon
some
singer
brow
than
was
the
conqueror
diadem
blest
now
by
lying
priests
soon
bent
and
bloody
hung
within
the
thorn
by
linnets
well
besung
who
think
but
little
of
the
corpse
beneath
though
ancient
lands
have
trembled
at
his
breath
but
to
this
king
fair
ceres
gifts
the
days
whereon
men
sung
in
flushed
lyæus
praise
tales
of
old
time
the
bloodless
sacrifice
unto
the
goddess
of
the
downcast
eyes
and
soft
persuading
lips
the
ringing
lyre
unto
the
bearer
of
the
holy
fire
who
once
had
been
amongst
them
things
like
these
seemed
meet
to
him
men
yearning
to
appease
these
were
the
triumphs
of
the
peaceful
king
and
so
betwixt
and
harvesting
with
little
fear
his
life
must
pass
away
and
for
the
rest
he
from
the
day
that
the
god
left
him
seemed
to
have
some
share
in
that
same
godhead
he
had
harboured
there
in
all
things
grew
his
wisdom
and
his
wealth
and
folk
beholding
the
fair
state
and
health
wherein
his
land
was
said
that
now
at
last
a
fragment
of
the
golden
age
was
cast
over
the
place
for
there
was
no
debate
and
men
forgot
the
very
name
of
hate
nor
failed
the
love
of
her
he
erst
had
won
to
hold
his
heart
as
still
the
years
wore
on
and
she
no
whit
less
fair
than
on
the
day
when
from
iolchos
first
she
passed
away
did
all
his
will
as
though
he
were
a
god
and
loving
still
the
downward
way
she
trod
honour
and
love
plenty
and
peace
he
had
nor
lacked
for
aught
that
makes
a
wise
man
glad
that
makes
him
like
a
rich
guest
scarce
sorry
when
the
time
comes
for
the
rest
that
at
the
end
perforce
must
bow
his
head
and
yet
was
death
not
much
rememberéd
as
still
with
happy
men
the
manner
is
or
was
he
not
so
pleased
with
this
world
bliss
as
to
be
sorry
when
the
time
should
come
when
but
his
name
should
hold
his
ancient
home
while
he
dwelt
nowhere
either
way
indeed
will
be
enough
for
most
men
daily
need
and
with
calm
faces
they
may
watch
the
world
and
note
men
lives
hither
and
thither
hurled
as
folk
may
watch
the
unfolding
of
a
play
nor
this
nor
that
was
king
admetus
way
for
neither
midst
the
sweetness
of
his
life
did
he
forget
the
ending
of
the
strife
nor
yet
for
heavy
thoughts
of
passing
pain
did
all
his
life
seem
lost
to
him
or
vain
a
wasteful
jest
of
jove
an
empty
dream
rather
before
him
did
a
vague
hope
gleam
that
made
him
a
man
and
wise
who
saw
the
deeds
of
men
with
eyes
and
dealt
them
pitying
justice
still
as
though
the
inmost
heart
of
each
man
he
did
know
this
hope
it
was
and
not
his
kingly
place
that
made
men
hearts
rejoice
to
see
his
face
rise
in
the
council
hall
through
this
men
felt
that
in
their
midst
a
son
of
man
there
dwelt
like
and
unlike
them
and
their
friend
through
all
and
still
as
time
went
on
the
more
would
fall
this
glory
on
the
king
belovéd
head
and
round
his
life
fresh
hope
and
fear
were
shed
yet
at
the
last
his
good
days
passed
away
and
sick
upon
his
bed
admetus
lay
him
and
death
nought
but
a
lessening
veil
of
hasty
minutes
yet
did
hope
not
fail
nor
did
bewildering
fear
torment
him
then
but
still
as
ever
all
the
ways
of
men
seemed
dear
to
him
but
he
while
yet
his
breath
still
held
the
gateway
the
arms
of
death
turned
to
his
wife
who
bowed
beside
the
bed
wept
for
his
love
and
dying
goodlihead
and
bade
her
put
all
folk
from
out
the
room
then
going
to
the
treasury
rich
gloom
to
bear
the
arrows
forth
the
lycian
gift
so
she
amidst
her
blinding
tears
made
shift
to
find
laid
in
the
inmost
treasury
those
shafts
and
brought
them
unto
him
but
he
beholding
them
beheld
therewith
his
life
both
that
now
past
with
many
marvels
rife
and
that
which
he
had
hoped
he
yet
should
see
then
spoke
he
faintly
love
thee
and
me
a
film
has
come
and
i
am
failing
fast
and
now
our
ancient
happy
life
is
past
for
either
this
is
death
dividing
hand
and
all
is
done
or
if
the
shadowy
land
i
yet
escape
full
surely
if
i
live
the
god
with
life
some
other
gift
will
give
and
change
me
unto
thee
at
this
tide
like
a
dead
man
among
you
all
i
bide
until
i
once
again
behold
my
guest
and
he
has
given
me
either
life
or
rest
alas
my
love
that
thy
too
loving
heart
nor
with
my
life
or
death
can
have
a
part
o
cruel
words
yet
death
is
cruel
too
stoop
down
and
kiss
me
for
i
yearn
for
you
as
the
autumn
yearneth
for
the
sun
o
love
a
little
time
we
have
been
one
and
if
we
now
are
twain
weep
not
therefore
for
many
a
man
on
earth
desireth
sore
to
have
some
mate
upon
the
toilsome
road
some
sharer
of
his
still
increasing
load
and
yet
for
all
his
longing
and
his
pain
his
troubled
heart
must
seek
for
love
in
vain
and
till
he
dies
still
must
he
be
alone
but
now
although
our
love
indeed
is
gone
yet
to
this
land
as
thou
art
leal
and
true
set
now
thine
hand
to
what
i
bid
thee
do
because
i
may
not
die
rake
up
the
brands
upon
the
hearth
and
from
these
trembling
hands
cast
incense
thereon
and
upon
them
lay
these
shafts
the
relics
of
a
happier
day
then
watch
with
me
perchance
i
may
not
die
though
the
supremest
hour
now
draws
anigh
of
life
or
death
o
thou
who
madest
me
the
only
thing
on
earth
alike
to
thee
why
must
i
be
unlike
to
thee
in
this
consider
if
thou
dost
not
do
amiss
to
slay
the
only
thing
that
feareth
death
or
knows
its
name
of
all
things
drawing
breath
upon
the
earth
see
now
for
no
short
hour
for
no
death
to
reach
me
slower
than
other
men
i
pray
thee
what
avail
to
add
some
trickling
grains
unto
the
tale
soon
told
of
minutes
thou
dost
snatch
away
from
out
the
midst
of
that
unending
day
wherein
thou
dwellest
rather
grant
me
this
to
right
me
wherein
thou
hast
done
amiss
and
give
me
life
like
thine
for
evermore
so
murmured
he
contending
very
sore
against
the
coming
death
but
she
meanwhile
faint
with
consuming
love
made
haste
to
pile
the
brands
upon
the
hearth
and
thereon
cast
sweet
incense
and
the
feathered
shafts
at
last
then
trembling
back
unto
the
bed
she
crept
and
lay
down
by
his
side
and
no
more
wept
nay
scarce
could
think
of
death
for
very
love
that
in
her
faithful
heart
for
ever
strove
fear
and
grief
but
now
the
the
old
familiar
chamber
did
enshroud
and
on
the
very
verge
of
death
drawn
close
wrapt
both
their
weary
souls
in
strange
repose
that
through
sweet
sleep
sent
kindly
images
of
simple
things
and
in
the
midst
of
these
whether
it
were
but
parcel
of
their
dream
or
that
they
woke
to
it
as
some
might
deem
i
know
not
but
the
door
was
opened
wide
and
the
king
name
a
voice
long
silent
cried
and
phoebus
on
the
very
threshold
trod
and
yet
in
nothing
liker
to
a
god
than
when
he
ruled
admetus
herds
for
he
still
wore
the
homespun
coat
men
used
to
see
among
the
heifers
in
the
summer
morn
and
round
about
him
hung
the
herdsman
horn
and
in
his
hand
he
bore
the
herdsman
spear
and
cornel
bow
the
prowling
fear
though
empty
of
its
shafts
the
quiver
was
he
to
the
middle
of
the
room
did
pass
and
said
admetus
neither
all
for
nought
my
coming
to
thee
is
nor
have
i
brought
good
tidings
to
thee
poor
man
thou
shalt
live
if
any
soul
for
thee
sweet
life
will
give
enforced
by
none
for
such
a
sacrifice
alone
the
fates
can
deem
a
fitting
price
for
thy
redemption
in
no
maddened
by
hope
of
glory
life
to
yield
to
give
it
up
to
heal
no
city
shame
in
hope
of
gaining
fame
for
whoso
dieth
for
thee
must
believe
that
thou
with
shame
that
last
gift
wilt
receive
and
strive
henceforward
with
forgetfulness
the
honied
draught
of
thy
new
life
to
bless
nay
and
moreover
such
a
glorious
heart
who
loves
thee
well
enough
with
life
to
part
but
for
thy
love
with
life
must
lose
love
too
which
when
wrapped
about
in
weeds
of
woe
is
godlike
life
indeed
to
such
an
one
and
now
behold
three
days
ere
life
is
done
do
the
fates
give
thee
and
i
even
i
upon
thy
life
have
shed
felicity
and
given
thee
love
of
men
that
they
in
turn
with
fervent
love
of
thy
dear
love
might
burn
the
people
love
thee
and
thy
breast
thine
open
doors
have
given
thee
better
rest
than
woods
of
spears
or
hills
of
walls
might
do
and
even
now
in
wakefulness
and
woe
the
city
lies
calling
to
mind
thy
love
wearying
with
ceaseless
prayers
the
gods
above
but
thou
thine
heart
is
wise
enough
to
know
that
they
no
whit
from
their
decrees
will
go
so
saying
swiftly
from
the
room
he
passed
but
on
the
world
no
look
admetus
cast
but
peacefully
turned
round
unto
the
wall
as
one
who
knows
that
quick
death
must
befall
for
in
his
heart
he
thought
indeed
too
well
i
know
what
men
are
this
strange
tale
to
tell
to
those
that
live
with
me
yea
they
will
weep
and
my
tomb
most
solemn
days
will
keep
and
in
great
chronicles
will
write
my
name
telling
to
many
an
age
my
deeds
and
fame
for
living
men
such
things
as
this
desire
and
by
such
ways
will
they
appease
the
fire
of
love
and
grief
but
when
death
comes
to
stare
full
in
men
faces
and
the
truth
lays
bare
how
can
we
then
have
wish
for
anything
but
unto
life
that
gives
us
all
to
cling
so
said
he
and
with
closed
eyes
did
await
sleeping
or
waking
the
decrees
of
fate
but
now
alcestis
rose
and
by
the
bed
she
stood
with
wild
thoughts
passing
through
her
head
dried
were
her
tears
her
troubled
heart
and
sore
throbbed
with
the
anguish
of
her
love
no
more
a
strange
look
on
the
dying
man
she
cast
then
covered
up
her
face
and
said
o
past
past
the
sweet
times
that
i
remember
well
alas
that
such
a
tale
my
heart
can
tell
ah
how
i
trusted
him
what
love
was
mine
how
sweet
to
feel
his
arms
about
me
twine
and
my
heart
beat
with
his
what
wealth
of
bliss
to
hear
his
praises
all
to
come
to
this
that
now
i
durst
not
look
upon
his
face
lest
in
my
heart
that
other
thing
have
place
that
which
i
knew
not
that
which
men
call
hate
o
me
the
bitterness
of
god
and
fate
a
little
time
ago
we
two
were
one
i
had
not
lost
him
though
his
life
was
done
for
still
was
he
in
me
but
now
alone
through
the
thick
darkness
must
my
soul
make
moan
for
i
must
die
how
can
i
live
to
bear
an
empty
heart
about
the
nurse
of
fear
how
can
i
live
to
die
some
other
tide
and
dying
hear
my
loveless
name
outcried
about
the
portals
of
that
weary
land
whereby
my
shadowy
feet
should
come
to
stand
alcestis
o
alcestis
hadst
thou
known
that
thou
one
day
shouldst
thus
be
left
alone
how
hadst
thou
borne
a
living
soul
to
love
hadst
thou
not
rather
lifted
hands
to
jove
to
turn
thine
heart
to
stone
thy
front
to
brass
that
through
this
wondrous
world
thy
soul
might
pass
well
pleased
and
careless
as
diana
goes
through
the
thick
woods
all
pitiless
of
those
her
shafts
smite
down
alas
how
could
it
be
can
a
god
give
a
god
delights
to
thee
nay
rather
jove
but
give
me
once
again
if
for
one
moment
only
that
sweet
pain
the
love
i
had
while
still
i
thought
to
live
ah
wilt
thou
not
since
unto
thee
i
give
my
life
my
hope
but
thou
i
come
to
thee
thou
sleepest
o
wake
not
nor
speak
to
me
in
silence
let
my
last
hour
pass
away
and
men
forget
my
bitter
feeble
day
with
that
she
laid
her
down
upon
the
bed
and
nestling
to
him
kissed
his
weary
head
and
laid
his
wasted
hand
upon
her
breast
yet
woke
him
not
and
silence
and
deep
rest
fell
on
that
chamber
the
night
wore
away
mid
gusts
of
wailing
wind
the
twilight
grey
stole
the
sea
and
wrought
his
wondrous
change
on
things
unseen
by
night
by
day
not
strange
but
now
half
seen
and
strange
then
came
the
sun
and
therewithal
the
silent
world
and
dun
waking
waxed
full
of
sound
as
men
again
their
heap
of
troubles
found
and
woke
up
to
their
joy
or
misery
but
there
unmoved
by
aught
those
twain
did
lie
until
admetus
ancient
nurse
drew
near
unto
the
open
door
and
full
of
fear
beheld
them
moving
not
and
as
folk
dead
then
trembling
with
her
eagerness
and
dread
she
cried
admetus
art
thou
dead
indeed
alcestis
livest
thou
my
words
to
heed
alas
alas
for
this
thessalian
folk
but
with
her
piercing
cry
the
king
awoke
and
round
about
him
wildly
to
stare
as
a
bewildered
man
who
knows
not
where
he
has
awakened
but
not
thin
or
wan
his
face
was
now
as
of
a
dying
man
but
fresh
and
ruddy
and
his
eyes
shone
clear
as
of
a
man
who
much
of
life
may
bear
and
at
the
first
but
joy
and
great
surprise
shone
out
from
those
awakened
eyes
but
as
for
something
more
at
last
he
yearned
unto
his
love
with
troubled
brow
he
turned
for
still
she
seemed
to
sleep
alas
alas
her
lonely
shadow
even
now
did
pass
along
the
changeless
fields
oft
looking
back
as
though
it
yet
had
thought
of
some
great
lack
and
here
the
hand
just
fallen
from
off
his
breast
was
cold
and
cold
the
bosom
his
hand
pressed
and
even
as
the
colour
lit
the
day
the
colour
from
her
lips
had
waned
away
yet
still
as
though
that
happiness
had
come
again
her
faithful
heart
to
bless
those
white
lips
smiled
unwrinkled
was
her
brow
but
of
her
eyes
no
secrets
might
he
know
for
hidden
by
the
lids
of
ivory
had
they
beheld
that
death
nigh
then
her
dead
corpse
king
admetus
hung
such
sorrow
in
his
heart
as
his
faint
tongue
refused
to
utter
yet
the
night
but
dimly
he
remembered
and
the
sight
of
the
and
the
dreadful
word
that
seemed
to
cleave
all
hope
as
with
a
sword
yet
stronger
in
his
heart
a
knowledge
grew
that
nought
it
was
but
her
fond
heart
and
true
that
all
the
marvel
for
his
love
had
wrought
whereby
from
death
to
life
he
had
been
brought
that
dead
his
life
she
was
as
she
had
been
his
life
delight
while
still
she
lived
a
queen
and
he
fell
wondering
if
his
life
were
gain
so
wrapt
as
then
in
loneliness
and
pain
yet
therewithal
no
tears
would
fill
his
eyes
for
as
a
god
he
was
then
did
he
rise
and
gat
him
down
unto
the
and
when
the
people
saw
his
face
then
cried
aloud
for
joy
to
see
him
there
and
earth
again
to
them
seemed
blest
and
fair
and
though
indeed
they
did
lament
in
turn
when
of
alcestis
end
they
came
to
learn
scarce
was
it
more
than
seeming
or
at
least
the
silence
in
the
middle
of
a
feast
when
men
have
memory
of
their
heroes
slain
so
passed
the
order
of
the
world
again
victorious
summer
crowning
lusty
spring
rich
autumn
faint
with
wealth
of
harvesting
and
winter
the
earth
sleep
and
then
again
spring
summer
autumn
and
the
winter
pain
and
still
and
still
the
same
the
years
went
by
but
time
who
slays
so
many
a
memory
brought
hers
to
light
the
loving
queen
and
her
fair
soul
as
scent
of
flowers
unseen
sweetened
the
turmoil
of
long
centuries
for
soon
indeed
death
laid
his
hand
on
these
the
shouters
round
the
throne
upon
that
day
and
for
admetus
he
too
went
his
way
though
if
he
died
at
all
i
can
not
tell
but
either
on
the
earth
he
ceased
to
dwell
or
else
oft
born
again
had
many
a
name
but
through
all
lands
of
greece
alcestis
fame
grew
greater
and
about
her
husband
twined
lived
in
the
hearts
of
men
enshrined
see
i
have
told
her
tale
though
i
know
not
what
men
are
dwelling
now
on
that
green
spot
anigh
boebeis
or
if
pheræ
still
with
name
oft
changed
perchance
adown
the
hill
still
shows
its
white
walls
to
the
rising
sun
the
gods
at
least
remember
what
is
done
strange
felt
the
wanderers
at
his
tale
for
now
their
old
desires
it
seemed
once
more
to
show
unto
their
altered
hearts
when
now
the
rest
most
surely
coming
of
all
things
seemed
best
unless
by
death
perchance
they
yet
might
gain
some
space
to
try
such
deeds
as
now
in
vain
they
heard
of
amidst
stories
of
the
past
such
deeds
as
they
for
that
wild
hope
had
cast
from
out
their
hands
they
sighed
to
think
of
it
and
how
as
deedless
men
they
there
must
sit
yet
with
the
measured
falling
of
that
rhyme
mingled
the
lovely
sights
and
glorious
time
whereby
in
spite
of
hope
long
past
away
in
spite
of
knowledge
growing
day
by
day
of
lives
so
wasted
in
despite
of
death
with
sweet
content
that
eve
they
drew
their
breath
and
scarce
their
own
lives
seemed
to
touch
them
more
than
that
dead
queen
beside
boebéis
shore
bitter
and
sweet
so
mingled
in
them
both
their
lives
and
that
old
tale
they
had
been
loth
perchance
to
have
them
told
another
so
passed
the
sun
from
that
fair
summer
day
june
drew
unto
its
end
the
hot
bright
days
now
gat
from
men
as
much
of
blame
as
praise
as
rainless
still
they
passed
without
a
cloud
and
growing
grey
at
last
the
barley
bowed
before
the
wind
on
such
a
day
these
folk
amid
the
trellised
roses
lay
and
careless
for
a
little
while
at
least
crowned
with
the
mingled
blossoms
held
their
feast
nor
did
the
garden
lack
for
younger
folk
who
cared
no
more
for
burning
summer
yoke
than
the
sweet
breezes
of
the
but
through
the
thick
trees
wandered
far
and
wide
from
sun
to
shade
and
shade
to
sun
again
until
they
deemed
the
elders
would
be
fain
to
hear
the
tale
and
shadows
longer
grew
then
round
about
the
grave
old
men
they
drew
both
youths
and
maidens
and
beneath
their
feet
the
grass
seemed
greener
and
the
flowers
more
sweet
unto
the
elders
as
they
stood
around
so
through
the
calm
air
soon
arose
the
sound
of
one
old
voice
as
now
a
wanderer
spoke
o
friends
and
ye
fair
loving
gentle
folk
would
i
could
better
tell
a
tale
but
hark
to
this
which
while
our
good
ship
lay
within
the
weser
such
a
while
agone
a
fleming
told
me
as
we
sat
alone
one
sunday
evening
in
the
and
all
the
other
folk
were
gone
after
their
pleasure
like
men
surely
i
deem
it
no
great
wonder
then
that
i
remember
everything
he
said
since
from
that
sunday
eve
strange
fortune
led
that
keel
and
me
on
such
a
weary
way
well
at
the
least
it
serveth
you
the
lady
of
the
land
argument
a
certain
man
having
landed
on
an
island
in
the
greek
sea
found
there
a
beautiful
damsel
whom
he
would
fain
have
delivered
from
a
strange
and
dreadful
doom
but
failing
herein
he
died
soon
afterwards
it
happened
once
some
men
of
italy
midst
the
greek
islands
went
a
and
much
good
fortune
had
they
on
the
sea
of
many
a
man
they
had
the
ransoming
and
many
a
chain
they
gat
and
goodly
thing
and
midst
their
voyage
to
an
isle
they
came
whereof
my
story
keepeth
not
the
name
now
though
but
little
was
there
left
to
gain
because
the
richer
folk
had
gone
away
yet
since
by
this
of
water
they
were
fain
they
came
to
anchor
in
a
bay
whence
in
a
while
some
went
ashore
to
play
going
but
lightly
armed
in
twos
or
threes
for
midst
that
folk
they
feared
no
enemies
and
of
these
fellows
that
thus
went
ashore
one
was
there
who
left
all
his
friends
behind
who
going
inland
ever
more
and
more
and
being
left
quite
alone
at
last
did
find
a
lonely
valley
sheltered
from
the
wind
wherein
amidst
an
ancient
cypress
wood
a
ruined
castle
stood
the
wood
once
ordered
in
fair
grove
and
glade
with
gardens
overlooked
by
terraces
and
pools
for
pleasure
made
was
tangled
now
and
choked
with
fallen
trees
and
he
who
went
there
with
but
little
ease
must
stumble
by
the
stream
side
once
made
meet
for
tender
women
dainty
wandering
feet
the
raven
croak
the
low
wind
choked
and
drear
the
baffled
stream
the
grey
wolf
doleful
cry
were
all
the
sounds
that
mariner
could
hear
as
through
the
wood
he
wandered
painfully
but
as
unto
the
house
he
drew
anigh
the
pillars
of
a
ruined
shrine
he
saw
the
once
fair
temple
of
a
fallen
law
no
image
was
there
left
behind
to
tell
before
whose
face
the
knees
of
men
had
bowed
an
altar
of
black
stone
of
old
wrought
well
alone
beneath
a
ruined
roof
now
showed
the
goal
whereto
the
folk
were
wont
to
crowd
seeking
for
things
forgotten
long
ago
praying
for
heads
long
ages
laid
close
to
the
temple
was
the
doorless
and
crumbling
there
our
fellow
turned
trembling
indeed
at
what
might
chance
to
wait
the
prey
entrapped
yet
with
a
heart
that
burned
to
know
the
most
of
what
might
there
be
learned
and
hoping
somewhat
too
amid
his
fear
to
light
on
such
things
as
all
men
hold
dear
noble
the
house
was
nor
seemed
built
for
war
but
rather
like
the
work
of
other
days
when
men
in
better
peace
than
now
they
are
had
leisure
on
the
world
around
to
gaze
and
noted
well
the
past
times
changing
ways
and
fair
with
sculptured
stories
it
was
wrought
by
lapse
of
time
unto
dim
ruin
brought
now
as
he
looked
about
on
all
these
things
and
strove
to
read
the
mouldering
histories
above
the
door
an
image
with
wide
wings
whose
unclad
limbs
a
serpent
seemed
to
seize
he
dimly
saw
although
the
western
breeze
and
years
of
biting
frost
and
washing
rain
had
made
the
carver
labour
vain
but
this
though
perished
sore
and
worn
away
he
noted
well
because
it
seemed
to
be
after
the
fashion
of
another
day
some
great
man
badge
of
war
or
armoury
and
round
it
a
carved
wreath
he
seemed
to
see
but
taking
note
of
these
things
at
the
last
the
mariner
beneath
the
gateway
passed
and
there
a
lovely
cloistered
court
he
found
a
fountain
in
the
midst
and
dry
and
in
the
cloister
briers
twining
round
the
slender
shafts
the
wondrous
imagery
outworn
by
more
than
many
years
gone
by
because
the
country
people
in
their
fear
of
wizardry
had
wrought
destruction
here
and
piteously
these
fair
things
had
been
maimed
there
stood
great
jove
lacking
his
head
of
might
here
was
the
archer
swift
apollo
lamed
the
shapely
limbs
of
venus
hid
from
sight
by
weeds
and
shards
diana
ankles
light
bound
with
the
cable
of
some
coasting
ship
and
rusty
nails
through
helen
maddening
lip
therefrom
unto
the
chambers
did
he
pass
and
found
them
fair
still
midst
of
their
decay
though
in
them
now
no
sign
of
man
there
was
and
everything
but
stone
had
passed
away
that
made
them
lovely
in
that
vanished
day
nay
the
mere
walls
themselves
would
soon
be
gone
and
nought
be
left
but
heaps
of
mouldering
stone
but
he
when
all
the
place
he
had
gone
and
with
much
trouble
clomb
the
broken
stair
and
from
the
topmost
turret
seen
the
shore
and
his
good
ship
drawn
up
at
anchor
there
came
down
again
and
found
a
crypt
most
fair
built
wonderfully
beneath
the
greatest
hall
and
there
he
saw
a
door
within
the
wall
close
shut
nor
was
there
in
that
place
another
on
its
hinges
therefore
he
stood
there
and
pondered
for
a
little
space
and
thought
perchance
some
marvel
i
shall
see
for
surely
here
some
dweller
there
must
be
because
this
door
seems
whole
and
new
and
sound
while
nought
but
ruin
i
can
see
around
so
with
that
word
moved
by
a
strong
desire
he
tried
the
hasp
that
yielded
to
his
hand
and
in
a
strange
place
lit
as
by
a
fire
unseen
but
near
he
presently
did
stand
and
by
an
odorous
breeze
his
face
was
fanned
as
though
in
some
arabian
plain
he
stood
anigh
the
border
of
a
wood
he
moved
not
for
awhile
but
looking
round
he
wondered
much
to
see
the
place
so
fair
because
unlike
the
castle
above
ground
no
pillager
or
wrecker
had
been
there
it
seemed
that
time
had
passed
on
otherwhere
nor
laid
a
finger
on
this
hidden
place
rich
with
the
wealth
of
some
forgotten
race
with
hangings
fresh
as
when
they
left
the
loom
the
walls
were
hung
a
space
above
the
head
slim
ivory
chairs
were
set
about
the
room
and
in
one
corner
was
a
dainty
bed
that
seemed
for
some
fair
queen
apparelléd
and
marble
was
the
worst
stone
of
the
floor
that
with
rich
indian
webs
was
covered
the
wanderer
trembled
when
he
saw
all
this
because
he
deemed
by
magic
it
was
wrought
yet
in
his
heart
a
longing
for
some
bliss
whereof
the
hard
and
changing
world
knows
nought
arose
and
urged
him
on
and
dimmed
the
thought
that
there
perchance
some
devil
lurked
to
slay
the
heedless
wanderer
from
the
light
of
day
over
against
him
was
another
door
set
in
the
wall
so
casting
fear
aside
with
hurried
steps
he
crossed
the
varied
floor
and
there
again
the
silver
latch
he
tried
and
with
no
pain
the
door
he
opened
wide
and
entering
the
new
chamber
cautiously
the
glory
of
great
heaps
of
gold
could
see
upon
the
floor
uncounted
medals
lay
like
things
of
little
value
here
and
there
stood
golden
caldrons
that
might
well
outweigh
the
biggest
midst
an
emperor
and
golden
cups
were
set
on
tables
fair
themselves
of
gold
and
in
all
hollow
things
were
stored
great
gems
worthy
the
crowns
of
kings
the
walls
and
roof
with
gold
were
overlaid
and
precious
raiment
from
the
wall
hung
down
the
fall
of
kings
that
treasure
might
have
stayed
or
gained
some
longing
conqueror
great
renown
or
built
again
some
old
town
what
wonder
if
this
plunderer
of
the
sea
stood
gazing
at
it
long
and
dizzily
but
at
the
last
his
troubled
eyes
and
dazed
he
lifted
from
the
glory
of
that
gold
and
then
the
image
that
erased
over
the
he
did
behold
above
a
door
well
wrought
in
coloured
gold
again
he
saw
a
naked
girl
with
wings
enfolded
in
a
serpent
scaly
rings
and
even
as
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
it
a
woman
voice
came
from
the
other
side
and
through
his
heart
strange
hopes
began
to
flit
that
in
some
wondrous
land
he
might
abide
not
dying
master
of
a
deathless
bride
so
the
gold
which
now
he
scarce
could
see
he
went
and
passed
this
last
door
eagerly
then
in
a
room
he
stood
wherein
there
was
a
marble
bath
whose
brimming
water
yet
was
scarcely
still
a
vessel
of
green
glass
half
full
of
odorous
ointment
was
there
set
upon
the
topmost
step
that
still
was
wet
and
jewelled
shoes
and
women
dainty
gear
lay
cast
upon
the
varied
pavement
near
in
one
quick
glance
these
things
his
eyes
did
see
but
speedily
they
turned
round
to
behold
another
sight
for
throned
on
ivory
there
sat
a
woman
whose
wet
tresses
rolled
on
to
the
floor
in
waves
of
gleaming
gold
cast
back
from
such
a
form
as
erewhile
shown
to
one
poor
shepherd
lighted
up
troy
town
naked
she
was
the
kisses
of
her
feet
upon
the
floor
a
dying
path
had
made
from
the
full
bath
unto
her
ivory
seat
in
her
right
hand
upon
her
bosom
laid
she
held
a
golden
comb
a
mirror
weighed
her
left
hand
down
aback
her
fair
head
lay
dreaming
awake
of
some
long
vanished
day
her
eyes
were
shut
but
she
seemed
not
to
sleep
her
lips
were
murmuring
things
unheard
and
low
or
sometimes
twitched
as
though
she
needs
must
weep
though
from
her
eyes
the
tears
refused
to
flow
and
oft
with
heavenly
red
her
cheek
did
glow
as
if
remembrance
of
some
shame
across
the
web
of
many
memories
came
there
stood
the
man
scarce
daring
to
draw
breath
for
fear
the
lovely
sight
should
fade
away
forgetting
heaven
forgetting
life
and
death
trembling
for
fear
lest
something
he
should
say
unwitting
lest
some
sob
should
yet
betray
his
presence
there
for
to
his
eager
eyes
already
did
the
tears
begin
to
rise
but
as
he
gazed
she
moved
and
with
a
sigh
bent
forward
dropping
down
her
golden
head
alas
alas
another
day
gone
by
another
day
and
no
soul
come
she
said
another
year
and
still
i
am
not
dead
and
with
that
word
once
more
her
head
she
raised
and
on
the
trembling
man
with
great
eyes
gazed
then
he
imploring
hands
to
her
did
reach
and
toward
her
very
slowly
to
move
and
with
wet
eyes
her
pity
did
beseech
and
seeing
her
about
to
speak
he
strove
from
trembling
lips
to
utter
words
of
love
but
with
a
look
she
stayed
his
doubtful
feet
and
made
sweet
music
as
their
eyes
did
meet
for
now
she
spoke
in
gentle
voice
and
clear
using
the
greek
tongue
that
he
knew
full
well
what
man
art
thou
that
thus
hast
wandered
here
and
found
this
lonely
chamber
where
i
dwell
beware
beware
for
i
have
many
a
spell
if
greed
of
power
and
gold
have
led
thee
on
not
lightly
shall
this
untold
wealth
be
won
but
if
thou
here
knowing
of
my
tale
in
hope
to
bear
away
my
body
fair
stout
must
thine
heart
be
nor
shall
that
avail
if
thou
a
wicked
soul
in
thee
dost
bear
so
once
again
i
bid
thee
to
beware
because
no
base
man
things
like
this
may
see
and
live
thereafter
long
and
happily
lady
he
said
in
florence
is
my
home
and
in
my
city
noble
is
my
name
neither
on
peddling
voyage
am
i
come
but
like
my
fathers
bent
to
gather
fame
and
though
thy
face
has
set
my
heart
yet
of
thy
story
nothing
do
i
know
but
here
have
wandered
heedlessly
enow
but
since
the
sight
of
thee
mine
eyes
did
bless
what
can
i
be
but
thine
what
wouldst
thou
have
from
those
thy
words
i
deem
from
some
distress
by
deeds
of
mine
thy
dear
life
i
might
save
o
then
delay
not
if
one
ever
gave
his
life
to
any
mine
i
give
to
thee
come
tell
me
what
the
price
of
love
must
be
swift
death
to
be
with
thee
a
day
and
night
and
with
the
earliest
dawning
to
be
slain
or
better
a
long
year
of
great
delight
and
many
years
of
misery
and
pain
or
worse
and
this
poor
hour
for
all
my
gain
a
sorry
merchant
am
i
on
this
day
as
thou
wiliest
so
must
i
obey
she
said
what
brave
words
nought
divine
am
i
but
an
unhappy
and
maid
compelled
by
evil
fate
and
destiny
to
live
who
long
ago
should
have
been
laid
under
the
earth
within
the
cypress
shade
hearken
awhile
and
quickly
shalt
thou
know
what
deed
i
pray
thee
to
accomplish
now
god
grant
indeed
thy
words
are
not
for
nought
then
shalt
thou
save
me
since
for
many
a
day
to
such
a
dreadful
life
i
have
been
brought
nor
will
i
spare
with
all
my
heart
to
pay
what
man
soever
takes
my
grief
away
ah
i
will
love
thee
if
thou
lovest
me
but
well
enough
my
saviour
now
to
be
my
father
lived
a
many
years
agone
lord
of
this
land
master
of
all
cunning
who
ruddy
gold
could
draw
from
out
grey
stone
and
gather
wealth
from
many
an
uncouth
thing
he
made
the
wilderness
rejoice
and
sing
and
such
a
leech
he
was
that
none
could
say
without
his
word
what
soul
should
pass
away
unto
diana
such
a
gift
he
gave
goddess
above
below
and
on
the
earth
that
i
should
be
her
virgin
and
her
slave
from
the
first
hour
of
my
most
wretched
birth
therefore
my
life
had
known
but
little
mirth
when
i
had
come
unto
my
twentieth
year
and
the
last
time
of
hallowing
drew
anear
so
in
her
temple
had
i
lived
and
died
and
all
would
long
ago
have
passed
away
but
ere
that
time
came
did
strange
things
betide
whereby
i
am
alive
unto
this
day
alas
the
bitter
words
that
i
must
say
ah
can
i
bring
my
wretched
tongue
to
tell
how
i
was
brought
unto
this
fearful
hell
a
queen
i
was
what
gods
i
knew
i
loved
and
nothing
evil
was
there
in
my
thought
and
yet
by
love
my
wretched
heart
was
moved
until
to
utter
ruin
i
was
brought
alas
thou
sayest
our
gods
were
vain
and
nought
wait
wait
till
thou
hast
heard
this
tale
of
mine
then
shalt
thou
think
them
devilish
or
divine
hearken
in
spite
of
father
and
of
vow
i
loved
a
man
but
for
that
sin
i
think
men
had
forgiven
me
yea
yea
even
thou
but
from
the
gods
the
full
cup
must
i
drink
and
into
misery
unheard
of
sink
tormented
when
their
own
names
are
forgot
and
men
must
doubt
if
they
lived
or
not
glorious
my
lover
was
unto
my
sight
most
beautiful
of
love
we
grew
so
fain
that
we
at
last
agreed
that
on
a
night
we
should
be
happy
but
that
he
were
slain
or
shut
in
hold
and
neither
joy
nor
pain
should
else
forbid
that
time
to
be
so
came
the
night
that
made
a
wretch
of
me
ah
i
well
do
i
remember
all
that
night
when
through
the
window
shone
the
orb
of
june
and
by
the
bed
flickered
the
taper
light
whereby
i
trembled
gazing
at
the
moon
ah
me
the
meeting
that
we
had
when
soon
into
his
strong
arms
i
fell
and
many
a
sorrow
we
began
to
tell
ah
me
i
what
parting
on
that
night
we
had
i
think
the
story
of
my
great
despair
a
little
while
might
merry
folk
make
sad
for
as
he
swept
away
my
yellow
hair
to
make
my
shoulder
and
my
bosom
bare
i
raised
mine
eyes
and
shuddering
could
behold
a
shadow
cast
upon
the
bed
of
gold
then
suddenly
was
quenched
my
hot
desire
and
he
untwined
his
arms
the
moon
so
pale
a
while
ago
seemed
changed
to
blood
and
fire
and
yet
my
limbs
beneath
me
did
not
fail
and
neither
had
i
strength
to
cry
or
wail
but
stood
there
helpless
bare
and
shivering
with
staring
eyes
still
fixed
upon
the
thing
because
the
shade
that
on
the
bed
of
gold
the
changed
and
dreadful
moon
was
throwing
down
was
of
diana
whom
i
did
behold
with
knotted
hair
and
shining
gown
and
on
the
high
white
brow
a
deadly
frown
bent
upon
us
who
stood
scarce
drawing
breath
striving
to
meet
the
horrible
sure
death
no
word
at
all
the
dreadful
goddess
said
but
soon
across
my
feet
my
lover
lay
and
well
indeed
i
knew
that
he
was
dead
and
would
that
i
had
died
on
that
same
day
for
in
a
while
the
image
turned
away
and
without
words
my
doom
i
understood
and
felt
a
horror
change
my
human
blood
and
there
i
fell
and
on
the
floor
i
lay
by
the
dead
man
till
daylight
came
on
me
and
not
a
word
thenceforward
could
i
say
for
three
years
till
of
grief
and
misery
the
lingering
pest
the
cruel
enemy
my
father
and
his
folk
were
dead
and
gone
and
in
this
castle
i
was
left
alone
and
then
the
doom
foreseen
upon
me
fell
for
queen
diana
did
my
body
change
into
a
dragon
flesh
and
fell
and
through
the
island
nightly
do
i
range
or
in
the
green
sea
mate
with
monsters
strange
when
in
the
middle
of
the
moonlit
night
the
sleepy
mariner
i
do
affright
but
all
day
long
upon
this
gold
i
lie
within
this
place
where
never
mason
hand
smote
trowel
on
the
marble
noisily
drowsy
i
lie
no
folk
at
my
command
who
once
was
called
the
lady
of
the
land
who
might
have
bought
a
kingdom
with
a
kiss
yea
half
the
world
with
such
a
sight
as
this
and
therewithal
with
rosy
fingers
light
backward
her
hair
she
threw
to
give
her
naked
beauty
more
to
sight
but
when
forgetting
all
the
things
he
knew
maddened
with
love
unto
the
prize
he
drew
she
cried
nay
wait
for
wherefore
wilt
thou
die
why
should
we
not
be
happy
thou
and
i
wilt
thou
not
save
me
once
in
every
year
this
rightful
form
of
mine
that
thou
dost
see
by
favour
of
the
goddess
have
i
here
from
sunrise
unto
sunset
given
me
that
some
brave
man
may
end
my
misery
and
thou
art
thou
not
brave
can
thy
heart
fail
whose
eyes
now
are
weeping
at
my
tale
then
listen
when
this
day
is
overpast
a
fearful
monster
shall
i
be
again
and
thou
mayst
be
my
saviour
at
the
last
unless
once
more
thy
words
are
nought
and
vain
if
thou
of
love
and
sovereignty
art
fain
come
thou
next
morn
and
when
thou
seest
here
a
hideous
dragon
have
thereof
no
fear
but
take
the
loathsome
head
up
in
thine
hands
and
kiss
it
and
be
master
presently
of
twice
the
wealth
that
is
in
all
the
lands
from
cathay
to
the
head
of
italy
and
master
also
if
it
pleaseth
thee
of
all
thou
praisest
as
so
fresh
and
bright
of
what
thou
callest
crown
of
all
delight
ah
with
what
joy
then
shall
i
see
again
the
sunlight
on
the
green
grass
and
the
trees
and
hear
the
clatter
of
the
summer
rain
and
see
the
joyous
folk
beyond
the
seas
ah
me
to
hold
my
child
upon
my
knees
after
the
weeping
of
unkindly
tears
and
all
the
wrongs
of
these
four
hundred
years
go
now
go
quick
leave
this
grey
heap
of
stone
and
from
thy
glad
heart
think
upon
thy
way
how
i
shall
love
thee
yea
love
thee
alone
that
bringest
me
from
dark
death
unto
day
for
this
shall
be
thy
wages
and
thy
pay
wealth
love
is
near
if
thou
hast
heart
a
little
dread
to
bear
therewith
she
turned
to
go
but
he
cried
out
ah
wilt
thou
leave
me
then
without
one
kiss
to
slay
the
very
seeds
of
fear
and
doubt
that
glad
may
bring
certain
bliss
hast
thou
forgotten
how
love
lives
by
this
the
memory
of
some
hopeful
close
embrace
low
whispered
words
within
some
lonely
place
but
she
when
his
bright
glittering
eyes
she
saw
and
burning
cheeks
cried
out
alas
alas
must
i
be
quite
undone
and
wilt
thou
draw
a
worse
fate
on
me
than
the
first
one
was
o
haste
thee
from
this
fatal
place
to
pass
yet
ere
thou
goest
take
this
lest
thou
shouldst
deem
thou
hast
been
fooled
by
some
strange
midday
dream
so
saying
blushing
like
a
maid
from
off
her
neck
a
little
gem
she
drew
that
those
snowy
hillocks
laid
the
secrets
of
her
glorious
beauty
knew
and
ere
he
well
perceived
what
she
would
do
she
touched
his
hand
the
gem
within
it
lay
and
turning
from
his
sight
she
fled
away
then
at
the
doorway
where
her
rosy
heel
had
glanced
and
vanished
he
awhile
did
stare
and
still
upon
his
hand
he
seemed
to
feel
the
varying
kisses
of
her
fingers
fair
then
turned
he
toward
the
dreary
crypt
and
bare
and
dizzily
throughout
the
castle
passed
till
by
the
ruined
fane
he
stood
at
last
then
weighing
still
the
gem
within
his
hand
he
stumbled
backward
through
the
cypress
wood
thinking
the
while
of
some
strange
lovely
land
where
all
his
life
should
be
most
fair
and
good
till
on
the
valley
wall
of
hills
he
stood
and
slowly
thence
passed
down
unto
the
bay
red
with
the
death
of
that
bewildering
day
the
next
day
came
and
he
who
all
the
night
had
ceaselessly
been
turning
in
his
bed
arose
and
clad
himself
in
armour
bright
and
many
a
danger
he
rememberéd
storming
of
towns
lone
sieges
full
of
dread
that
with
renown
his
heart
had
borne
him
through
and
this
thing
seemed
a
little
thing
to
do
so
on
he
went
and
on
the
way
he
thought
of
all
the
glorious
things
of
yesterday
nought
of
the
price
whereat
they
must
be
bought
but
ever
to
himself
did
softly
say
no
roaming
now
my
wars
are
passed
away
no
long
dull
days
devoid
of
happiness
when
such
a
love
my
yearning
heart
shall
bless
thus
to
the
castle
did
he
come
at
last
but
when
unto
the
gateway
he
drew
near
and
underneath
its
ruined
archway
passed
into
the
court
a
strange
noise
did
he
hear
and
through
his
heart
there
shot
a
pang
of
fear
trembling
he
gat
his
sword
into
his
hand
and
midmost
of
the
cloisters
took
his
stand
but
for
a
while
that
unknown
noise
increased
a
rattling
that
with
strident
roars
did
blend
and
whining
moans
but
suddenly
it
ceased
a
fearful
thing
stood
at
the
cloister
end
and
eyed
him
for
a
while
then
to
wend
adown
the
cloisters
and
began
again
that
rattling
and
the
moan
like
fiends
in
pain
and
as
it
came
on
towards
him
with
its
teeth
the
body
of
a
slain
goat
did
it
tear
the
blood
whereof
in
its
hot
jaws
did
seethe
and
on
its
tongue
he
saw
the
smoking
hair
then
his
heart
sank
and
standing
trembling
there
throughout
his
mind
wild
thoughts
and
fearful
ran
some
fiend
she
was
he
said
the
bane
of
man
yet
he
abode
her
still
although
his
blood
curdled
within
him
the
thing
dropped
the
goat
and
creeping
on
came
close
to
where
he
stood
and
raised
its
head
to
him
and
wrinkled
throat
then
he
cried
out
and
wildly
at
her
smote
shutting
his
eyes
and
turned
and
from
the
place
ran
swiftly
with
a
white
and
ghastly
face
but
little
things
rough
stones
and
seemed
and
if
he
fell
he
rose
and
ran
on
still
no
more
he
felt
his
hurts
than
if
he
dreamed
he
made
no
stay
for
valley
or
steep
hill
heedless
he
dashed
through
many
a
foaming
rill
until
he
came
unto
the
ship
at
last
and
with
no
word
into
the
deep
hold
passed
meanwhile
the
dragon
seeing
him
clean
gone
followed
him
not
but
crying
horribly
caught
up
within
her
jaws
a
block
of
stone
and
ground
it
into
powder
then
turned
she
with
cries
that
folk
could
hear
far
out
at
sea
and
reached
the
treasure
set
apart
of
old
to
brood
above
the
hidden
heaps
of
gold
yet
was
she
seen
again
on
many
a
day
by
some
mariner
or
herd
playing
amid
the
ripples
of
the
bay
or
on
the
hills
making
all
things
afeard
or
in
the
wood
that
did
that
castle
gird
but
never
any
man
again
durst
go
to
seek
her
woman
form
and
end
her
woe
as
for
the
man
who
knows
what
things
he
bore
what
mournful
faces
peopled
the
sad
night
what
wailings
vexed
him
with
reproaches
sore
what
images
of
that
delight
what
dreamed
caresses
from
soft
hands
and
white
turning
to
horrors
ere
they
reached
the
best
what
struggles
vain
what
shame
what
huge
unrest
no
man
he
knew
three
days
he
lay
and
raved
and
cried
for
death
until
a
lethargy
fell
on
him
and
his
fellows
thought
him
saved
but
on
the
third
night
he
awoke
to
die
and
at
byzantium
doth
his
body
lie
between
two
blossoming
pomegranate
trees
within
the
churchyard
of
the
genoese
a
moment
silence
as
his
tale
had
end
and
then
the
wind
of
that
june
night
did
blend
their
varied
voices
as
of
that
and
this
they
fell
to
talk
of
those
fair
islands
bliss
they
knew
in
other
days
of
hope
they
had
to
live
there
long
an
easy
life
and
glad
with
nought
to
vex
them
and
the
younger
men
began
to
nourish
strange
dreams
even
then
of
sailing
east
as
these
had
once
sailed
west
because
the
story
of
that
luckless
quest
with
hope
not
fear
had
filled
their
joyous
hearts
and
made
them
dream
of
new
and
noble
parts
that
they
might
act
of
raising
up
the
name
their
fathers
bore
and
winning
boundless
fame
these
too
with
little
patience
seemed
to
hear
that
story
end
with
shame
and
grief
and
fear
a
little
thing
the
man
had
had
to
do
they
said
if
longing
burned
within
him
so
but
at
their
words
the
older
men
must
bow
their
heads
and
smiling
somewhat
thoughtful
grow
remembering
well
how
fear
in
days
gone
by
had
dealt
with
them
and
poisoned
wretchedly
good
days
good
deeds
and
longings
for
all
good
yet
on
the
evil
times
they
would
not
brood
but
sighing
strove
to
raise
the
weight
of
years
and
no
more
memory
of
their
hopes
and
fears
they
nourished
but
such
gentle
thoughts
as
fed
the
pensiveness
which
that
sweet
season
bred
july
fair
was
the
morn
the
blossom
scent
floated
across
the
fresh
grass
and
the
bees
with
low
vexed
song
from
rose
to
lily
went
a
gentle
wind
was
in
the
heavy
trees
and
thine
eyes
shone
with
joyous
memories
fair
was
the
early
morn
and
fair
wert
thou
and
i
was
happy
ah
be
happy
now
peace
and
content
without
us
love
within
that
hour
there
was
now
thunder
and
wild
rain
have
wrapped
the
cowering
world
and
foolish
sin
and
nameless
pride
have
made
us
wise
in
vain
ah
love
although
the
morn
shall
come
again
and
on
new
the
new
sun
shall
smile
can
we
regain
what
we
have
lost
meanwhile
now
the
west
grows
clear
of
storm
and
threat
but
midst
the
lightning
did
the
fair
sun
die
ah
he
shall
rise
again
for
ages
yet
he
can
not
waste
his
life
but
thou
and
i
who
knows
if
next
morn
this
felicity
my
lips
may
feel
or
if
thou
still
shalt
live
this
seal
of
love
renewed
once
more
to
give
within
a
lovely
valley
watered
well
with
flowery
streams
the
july
feast
befell
and
there
within
the
fair
abode
they
cast
aside
their
trouble
heavy
load
scarce
made
aweary
by
the
sultry
day
the
earth
no
longer
laboured
shaded
lay
the
kine
across
the
sunny
vale
from
hill
to
hill
the
wandering
rook
did
sail
lazily
croaking
midst
his
dreams
of
spring
nor
more
awake
the
dove
did
cling
unto
the
murmuring
now
and
then
all
rested
but
the
restless
sons
of
men
and
the
great
sun
that
wrought
this
happiness
and
all
the
vale
with
fruitful
hopes
did
bless
so
in
a
marble
chamber
bright
with
flowers
the
old
men
feasted
through
the
fresher
hours
and
at
the
hottest
time
of
all
the
day
when
now
the
sun
was
on
his
downward
way
sat
listening
to
a
tale
an
elder
told
new
to
his
fathers
while
they
yet
did
hold
the
cities
of
some
grecian
isle
though
in
the
heavens
the
cloud
of
force
and
guile
was
gathering
dark
that
sent
them
the
sea
to
win
new
lands
for
their
posterity
the
son
of
croesus
argument
croesus
king
of
lydia
dreamed
that
he
saw
his
son
slain
by
an
iron
weapon
and
though
by
every
means
he
strove
to
avert
this
doom
from
him
yet
thus
it
happened
for
his
son
was
slain
by
the
hand
of
the
man
who
seemed
least
of
all
likely
to
do
the
deed
of
croesus
tells
my
tale
a
king
of
old
in
lydia
ere
the
mede
fell
on
the
land
a
man
made
mighty
by
great
heaps
of
gold
feared
for
the
myriads
strong
of
heart
and
hand
that
his
banners
wrought
out
his
command
and
though
his
latter
ending
happed
on
ill
yet
first
of
every
joy
he
had
his
fill
two
sons
he
had
and
one
was
dumb
from
birth
the
other
one
that
atys
had
to
name
grew
up
a
fair
youth
and
of
might
and
worth
and
well
it
seemed
the
race
wherefrom
he
came
from
him
should
never
get
reproach
or
shame
but
yet
no
stroke
he
struck
before
his
death
in
no
he
spent
his
latest
breath
now
croesus
lying
on
his
bed
anight
dreamed
that
he
saw
this
dear
son
laid
and
folk
lamenting
he
was
slain
outright
and
that
some
iron
thing
had
dealt
the
blow
by
whose
hand
guided
he
could
nowise
know
or
if
in
peace
by
traitors
it
were
done
or
in
some
open
war
not
yet
begun
three
times
one
night
this
vision
broke
his
sleep
so
that
at
last
he
rose
up
from
his
bed
that
he
might
ponder
how
he
best
might
keep
the
threatened
danger
from
so
dear
a
head
and
since
he
now
was
old
enough
to
wed
the
king
sent
men
to
search
the
lands
around
until
some
matchless
maiden
should
be
found
that
in
her
arms
this
atys
might
forget
the
praise
of
men
and
fame
of
history
whereby
full
many
a
field
has
been
made
wet
with
blood
of
men
and
many
a
deep
green
sea
been
reddened
therewithal
and
yet
shall
be
that
her
sweet
voice
might
drown
the
people
praise
her
eyes
make
bright
the
uneventful
days
so
when
at
last
a
wonder
they
had
brought
from
some
sweet
land
down
by
the
ocean
rim
than
whom
no
fairer
could
by
man
be
thought
and
ancient
dames
scanning
her
limb
by
limb
had
said
that
she
was
fair
enough
for
him
to
her
was
atys
married
with
much
show
and
looked
to
dwell
with
her
in
bliss
enow
and
in
meantime
afield
he
never
went
either
to
hunting
or
the
frontier
war
no
dart
was
cast
nor
any
engine
bent
anigh
him
and
the
lydian
men
afar
must
rein
their
steeds
and
the
bright
blossoms
mar
if
they
have
any
lust
of
tourney
now
and
in
far
meadows
must
they
bend
the
bow
and
also
through
the
palace
everywhere
the
swords
and
spears
were
taken
from
the
wall
that
long
with
honour
had
been
hanging
there
and
from
the
golden
pillars
of
the
hall
lest
by
mischance
some
sacred
blade
should
fall
and
in
its
falling
bring
revenge
at
last
for
many
a
fatal
battle
overpast
and
every
day
king
croesus
wrought
with
care
to
save
his
dear
son
from
that
threatened
end
and
many
a
beast
he
offered
up
with
prayer
unto
the
gods
and
much
of
wealth
did
spend
that
they
so
prayed
might
yet
perchance
defend
that
life
until
at
least
that
he
were
dead
with
earth
laid
heavy
on
his
unseeing
head
but
in
the
midst
even
of
the
wedding
feast
there
came
a
man
who
by
the
golden
hall
sat
down
upon
the
steps
and
man
or
beast
he
heeded
not
but
there
against
the
wall
he
leaned
his
head
speaking
no
word
at
all
till
with
his
son
and
son
wife
came
the
king
and
then
unto
his
gown
the
man
did
cling
what
man
art
thou
the
king
said
to
him
then
that
in
such
guise
thou
prayest
on
thy
knee
hast
thou
some
fell
foe
here
among
my
men
or
hast
thou
done
an
ill
deed
unto
me
or
has
thy
wife
been
carried
over
sea
or
hast
thou
on
this
day
great
need
of
gold
or
say
why
else
thou
now
art
grown
so
bold
o
king
he
said
i
ask
no
gold
and
though
indeed
thy
greatness
drew
me
here
no
wrong
have
i
that
thou
couldst
wipe
away
and
nought
of
mine
the
pirate
folk
did
bear
across
the
sea
none
of
thy
folk
i
fear
but
all
the
gods
are
now
mine
enemies
therefore
i
kneel
before
thee
on
my
knees
for
as
with
mine
own
brother
on
a
day
within
the
running
place
at
home
i
played
unwittingly
i
smote
him
that
dead
upon
the
green
grass
he
was
laid
myself
i
fled
away
dismayed
wherefore
i
pray
thee
help
me
in
my
need
and
purify
my
soul
of
this
sad
deed
if
of
my
name
and
country
thou
wouldst
know
in
phrygia
yet
my
father
is
a
king
gordius
the
son
of
midas
rich
enow
in
corn
and
cattle
golden
cup
and
ring
and
mine
own
name
before
i
did
this
thing
was
called
adrastus
whom
in
street
and
hall
the
slayer
of
his
brother
men
now
call
friend
said
the
king
have
thou
no
fear
of
me
for
though
indeed
i
am
right
happy
now
yet
well
i
know
this
may
not
always
be
and
i
may
chance
some
day
to
kneel
full
low
and
to
some
happy
man
mine
head
to
bow
with
prayers
to
do
a
greater
thing
than
this
dwell
thou
with
us
and
win
again
thy
bliss
for
in
this
city
men
in
sport
and
play
forget
the
trouble
that
the
gods
have
sent
who
therewithal
send
wine
and
many
a
may
as
fair
as
she
for
whom
the
trojan
went
and
many
a
dear
delight
besides
have
lent
which
whoso
is
well
loved
of
them
shall
keep
till
in
forgetful
death
he
falls
asleep
therefore
shall
those
rites
be
done
that
kindred
blood
demands
that
thou
hast
shed
that
if
the
mouth
of
thine
own
mother
son
did
hap
to
curse
thee
ere
he
was
quite
dead
the
curse
may
lie
the
lighter
on
thine
head
because
the
head
of
many
a
beast
has
fallen
voiceless
in
our
glorious
feast
then
did
adrastus
rise
and
thank
the
king
and
the
next
day
when
yet
low
was
the
sun
the
sacrifice
and
every
other
thing
that
unto
these
dread
rites
belonged
was
done
and
there
adrastus
dwelt
hated
of
none
and
loved
of
many
and
the
king
loved
him
for
brave
and
wise
he
was
and
strong
of
limb
but
chiefly
amongst
all
did
atys
love
the
luckless
stranger
whose
fair
tales
of
war
the
lydian
heart
abundantly
did
move
and
much
they
talked
of
wandering
out
afar
some
day
to
lands
where
many
marvels
are
with
still
the
phrygian
through
all
things
to
be
the
leader
unto
all
felicity
now
at
this
time
folk
came
unto
the
king
who
on
a
forest
borders
dwelling
were
wherein
there
roamed
full
many
a
dangerous
thing
as
wolf
and
wild
bull
lion
and
brown
bear
but
chiefly
in
that
forest
was
the
lair
of
a
great
boar
that
no
man
could
withstand
and
many
a
woe
he
wrought
upon
the
land
since
long
ago
that
men
in
calydon
held
chase
no
beast
like
him
had
once
been
seen
he
ruined
vineyards
lying
in
the
sun
after
his
harvesting
the
men
must
glean
what
he
had
left
right
glad
they
had
not
been
among
the
tall
stalks
of
the
ripening
wheat
the
fell
destroyer
fatal
tusks
to
meet
for
often
would
the
lonely
man
entrapped
in
vain
from
his
dire
fury
strive
to
hide
in
some
thick
hedge
and
other
whiles
it
happed
some
careless
stranger
by
his
place
would
ride
and
the
tusks
smote
his
fallen
horse
side
and
what
help
then
to
such
a
wretch
could
come
with
sword
he
could
not
draw
and
far
from
home
or
else
girls
sent
their
to
fill
would
come
back
pale
too
terrified
to
cry
because
they
had
but
seen
him
from
the
hill
or
else
again
with
side
rent
wretchedly
some
hapless
damsel
midst
the
brake
would
lie
shortly
to
say
there
neither
man
nor
maid
was
safe
afield
whether
they
wrought
or
played
therefore
were
come
these
dwellers
by
the
wood
to
pray
the
king
brave
men
to
them
to
send
that
they
might
live
and
if
he
deemed
it
good
that
atys
with
the
other
knights
should
wend
they
thought
their
grief
the
easier
should
have
end
for
both
by
gods
and
men
they
knew
him
loved
and
easily
by
hope
of
glory
moved
o
sire
they
said
thou
how
hercules
was
not
content
to
wait
till
folk
asked
aid
but
sought
the
pests
among
their
guarded
trees
thou
what
name
the
theban
cadmus
made
and
how
the
bull
of
marathon
was
laid
dead
on
the
fallows
of
the
athenian
land
and
how
folk
worshipped
atalanta
hand
fair
would
thy
son
name
look
upon
the
roll
wherein
such
noble
deeds
as
this
are
told
and
great
delight
shall
surely
fill
thy
soul
thinking
upon
his
deeds
when
thou
art
old
and
thy
brave
heart
is
waxen
faint
and
cold
dost
thou
not
know
o
king
how
men
will
strive
that
they
when
dead
still
in
their
sons
may
live
he
shuddered
as
they
spoke
because
he
thought
most
certainly
a
winning
tale
is
this
to
draw
him
from
the
net
where
he
is
caught
for
hearts
of
men
grow
weary
of
all
bliss
nor
is
he
one
to
be
content
with
his
if
he
should
hear
the
of
fame
and
people
calling
on
his
name
good
friends
he
said
go
get
ye
back
again
and
doubt
not
i
will
send
you
men
to
slay
this
pest
ye
fear
yet
shall
your
prayer
be
vain
if
ye
with
any
other
speak
and
for
my
son
with
me
he
needs
must
stay
for
mighty
cares
oppress
the
lydian
land
fear
not
for
ye
shall
have
a
noble
band
and
with
that
promise
must
they
be
content
and
so
departed
having
feasted
well
and
yet
some
god
or
other
ere
they
went
if
they
were
silent
this
their
tale
must
tell
to
more
than
one
man
therefore
it
befell
that
at
the
last
prince
atys
knew
the
thing
and
came
with
angry
eyes
unto
the
king
father
he
said
since
when
am
i
grown
vile
since
when
am
i
grown
helpless
of
my
hands
or
else
what
folk
with
words
enwrought
with
guile
thine
ears
have
poisoned
that
when
lands
my
fame
might
fill
by
thy
most
strange
commands
i
needs
must
stay
within
this
slothful
home
whereto
would
god
that
i
had
never
come
what
wilt
thou
take
mine
honour
quite
away
wouldst
thou
that
as
with
her
i
just
have
wed
i
sit
among
thy
folk
at
end
of
day
she
should
be
ever
turning
round
her
head
to
watch
some
man
for
war
apparelled
because
he
wears
a
sword
that
he
may
use
which
grace
to
me
thou
ever
wilt
refuse
or
dost
thou
think
when
thou
hast
run
thy
race
and
thou
art
gone
and
in
thy
stead
i
reign
the
people
will
do
honour
to
my
place
or
that
the
lords
leal
men
will
still
remain
if
yet
my
father
sword
be
sharp
in
vain
if
on
the
wall
his
armour
still
hang
up
while
for
a
spear
i
hold
a
o
son
quoth
croesus
well
i
know
thee
brave
and
worthy
of
high
deeds
of
chivalry
therefore
the
more
thy
dear
life
would
i
save
which
now
is
threatened
by
the
gods
on
high
three
times
one
night
i
dreamed
i
saw
thee
die
slain
by
some
deadly
thing
while
weeping
lords
stood
round
thee
in
a
ring
then
loud
laughed
atys
and
he
said
again
father
and
did
this
ugly
dream
tell
thee
what
day
it
was
on
which
i
should
be
slain
as
may
the
gods
grant
i
may
one
day
be
and
not
from
sickness
die
right
wretchedly
groaning
with
pain
my
lords
about
my
bed
wishing
to
god
that
i
were
fairly
dead
but
slain
in
battle
as
the
lydian
kings
have
died
ere
now
in
some
great
victory
while
all
about
the
lydian
shouting
rings
death
to
the
beaten
foemen
as
they
fly
what
death
but
this
o
father
should
i
die
but
if
my
life
by
iron
shall
be
done
what
steel
shall
glitter
in
the
sun
yea
father
if
to
thee
it
seemeth
good
to
keep
me
from
the
bright
throng
let
me
be
brave
at
least
within
the
wood
for
surely
if
thy
dream
be
true
no
wrong
can
hap
to
me
from
this
beast
tushes
strong
unless
perchance
the
beast
is
grown
so
wise
he
haunts
the
forest
clad
in
lydian
guise
then
croesus
said
o
son
i
love
thee
so
that
thou
shalt
do
thy
will
upon
this
tide
but
since
unto
this
hunting
thou
must
go
a
trusty
friend
along
with
thee
shall
ride
who
not
for
anything
shall
leave
thy
side
i
think
indeed
he
loves
thee
well
enow
to
thrust
his
heart
thee
and
any
blow
go
then
o
son
and
if
by
some
short
span
thy
life
be
measured
how
shall
it
harm
thee
if
while
life
last
thou
art
a
happy
man
and
thou
art
happy
only
unto
me
is
trembling
left
and
infelicity
the
trembling
of
the
man
who
loves
on
earth
but
unto
thee
is
hope
and
present
mirth
nay
be
thou
not
ashamed
for
on
this
day
i
fear
not
much
thou
my
dream
aright
no
teeth
or
claws
shall
take
thy
life
away
and
it
may
chance
ere
thy
last
glorious
fight
i
shall
be
blinded
by
the
endless
night
and
brave
adrastus
on
this
day
shall
be
thy
safeguard
and
shall
give
good
heart
to
me
go
then
and
send
him
hither
and
depart
and
as
the
heroes
did
so
mayst
thou
do
winning
such
fame
as
well
may
please
thine
heart
with
that
word
from
the
king
did
atys
go
who
left
behind
sighed
saying
may
it
be
so
even
as
i
hope
and
yet
i
would
to
god
these
men
upon
my
threshold
had
trod
so
when
adrastus
to
the
king
was
come
he
said
unto
him
o
my
phrygian
friend
we
in
this
land
have
given
thee
a
home
and
all
foes
your
life
will
we
defend
wherefore
for
us
that
life
thou
shouldest
spend
if
any
day
there
should
be
need
therefor
and
now
a
trusty
friend
i
need
right
sore
doubtless
ere
now
thou
hast
heard
many
say
there
is
a
doom
that
threatens
my
son
life
therefore
this
place
is
stript
of
arms
and
therefore
still
bides
atys
with
his
wife
and
tempts
not
any
god
by
raising
strife
yet
none
the
less
by
no
desire
of
his
to
whom
would
war
be
most
abundant
bliss
and
since
some
glory
he
may
gain
against
a
monstrous
bestial
enemy
and
that
the
meaning
of
my
dream
is
plain
that
saith
that
he
by
steel
alone
shall
die
his
burning
wish
i
may
not
well
deny
therefore
afield
doth
he
wend
and
herein
mayst
thou
show
thyself
my
friend
for
thou
as
captain
of
his
band
shalt
ride
and
keep
a
watchful
eye
of
everything
nor
leave
him
whatsoever
may
betide
lo
thou
art
brave
the
son
of
a
great
king
and
with
thy
praises
doth
this
city
ring
why
should
i
tell
thee
what
a
name
those
gain
who
dying
for
their
friends
die
not
in
vain
then
said
adrastus
now
were
i
grown
base
beyond
all
words
if
i
should
spare
for
aught
in
guarding
him
so
sit
with
smiling
face
and
of
this
matter
take
no
further
thought
because
with
my
life
shall
his
life
be
bought
if
ill
should
hap
and
no
ill
fate
it
were
if
i
should
die
for
what
i
hold
so
dear
then
went
adrastus
and
next
morn
all
things
that
unto
the
hunting
were
well
dight
and
forth
they
went
clad
as
the
sons
of
kings
fair
was
the
morn
as
through
the
sunshine
bright
they
rode
the
prince
half
wild
with
great
delight
the
phrygian
smiling
on
him
soberly
and
ever
looking
round
with
watchful
eye
so
through
the
city
all
the
rout
rode
fast
with
many
a
great
yellow
hound
and
then
the
teeming
they
passed
until
they
came
to
sour
and
rugged
ground
and
there
rode
up
a
little
heathy
mound
that
overlooked
the
scrubby
woods
and
low
that
of
the
beast
lair
somewhat
they
might
know
and
there
a
good
man
of
the
showed
them
the
places
where
he
mostly
lay
and
they
descending
through
the
wood
did
ride
and
followed
on
his
tracks
for
half
the
day
and
at
the
last
they
brought
him
well
to
bay
within
an
oozy
space
amidst
the
wood
about
the
which
a
ring
of
alders
stood
so
when
the
hounds
changed
voices
clear
they
heard
with
hearts
aflame
on
towards
him
straight
they
drew
atys
the
first
of
all
of
nought
afeard
except
that
folk
should
say
some
other
slew
the
beast
and
lustily
his
horn
he
blew
going
afoot
then
mighty
spear
in
hand
adrastus
headed
all
the
following
band
now
when
they
came
unto
the
plot
of
ground
where
stood
the
boar
hounds
dead
about
him
lay
or
sprawled
about
bleeding
from
many
a
wound
but
still
the
others
held
him
well
at
bay
nor
had
he
been
bestead
thus
ere
that
day
but
yet
seeing
atys
straight
he
rushed
at
him
speckled
with
foam
bleeding
in
flank
and
limb
then
atys
stood
and
cast
his
spear
with
a
great
shout
and
straight
and
well
it
flew
for
now
the
broad
blade
cutting
through
the
ear
a
stream
of
blood
from
out
the
shoulder
drew
and
therewithal
another
no
less
true
adrastus
cast
whereby
the
boar
had
died
but
atys
drew
the
bright
sword
from
his
side
and
to
the
tottering
beast
he
drew
anigh
but
as
the
sun
rays
ran
adown
the
blade
adrastus
threw
a
javelin
hastily
for
of
the
mighty
beast
was
he
afraid
lest
by
his
wounds
he
should
not
yet
be
stayed
but
with
a
last
rush
cast
his
life
away
and
dying
there
the
son
of
croesus
slay
but
even
as
the
feathered
dart
he
hurled
his
strained
despairing
eyes
beheld
the
end
and
changed
seemed
all
the
fashion
of
the
world
and
past
and
future
into
one
did
blend
as
he
beheld
the
fixed
eyes
of
his
friend
that
no
reproach
had
in
them
and
no
fear
for
death
had
seized
him
ere
he
thought
him
near
adrastus
shrieked
and
running
up
he
caught
the
falling
man
and
from
his
bleeding
side
drew
out
the
dart
and
seeing
that
death
had
brought
deliverance
to
him
he
thereby
had
died
but
ere
his
hand
the
luckless
steel
could
guide
and
he
the
refuge
of
poor
souls
could
win
the
huntsmen
had
rushed
in
and
these
with
blows
and
cries
he
heeded
nought
his
unresisting
hands
made
haste
to
bind
then
of
the
a
bier
they
wrought
and
laid
the
corpse
thereon
and
to
wind
homeward
amidst
the
tangled
wood
and
blind
and
going
slowly
at
the
eventide
some
leagues
from
sardis
did
that
day
abide
onward
next
morn
the
slaughtered
man
they
bore
with
him
that
slew
him
and
at
end
of
day
they
reached
the
city
and
with
mourning
sore
toward
the
king
palace
did
they
take
their
way
he
in
an
open
western
chamber
lay
feasting
though
inwardly
his
heart
did
burn
until
that
atys
should
to
him
return
and
when
those
wails
first
smote
upon
his
ear
he
set
the
down
and
to
his
feet
he
rose
and
bitter
fear
swallowed
his
joy
and
nigh
he
went
to
meet
that
which
was
coming
through
the
weeping
street
but
in
the
end
he
thought
it
good
to
wait
and
stood
there
doubting
all
the
ills
of
fate
but
when
at
last
up
to
that
royal
place
folk
brought
the
thing
he
once
had
held
so
dear
still
stood
the
king
staring
with
ghastly
face
as
they
brought
forth
adrastus
and
the
bier
but
spoke
at
last
slowly
without
a
tear
o
phrygian
man
that
i
did
purify
is
it
through
thee
that
atys
came
to
die
o
king
adrastus
said
take
now
my
life
with
whatso
torment
seemeth
good
to
thee
as
my
word
went
for
i
would
end
this
strife
and
underneath
the
earth
lie
quietly
nor
is
it
my
will
here
alive
to
be
for
as
my
brother
so
prince
atys
died
and
this
unlucky
hand
some
god
did
guide
then
as
a
man
constrained
the
tale
he
told
from
end
to
end
nor
spared
himself
one
whit
and
as
he
spoke
the
wood
did
still
behold
the
trodden
grass
and
atys
dead
on
it
and
many
a
change
the
king
face
did
flit
of
kingly
rage
and
hatred
and
despair
as
on
the
slayer
face
he
still
did
stare
at
last
he
said
thy
death
avails
me
nought
the
gods
themselves
have
done
this
bitter
deed
that
i
was
all
too
happy
was
their
thought
therefore
thy
heart
is
dead
and
mine
doth
bleed
and
i
am
helpless
as
a
trodden
weed
thou
art
but
as
the
handle
of
the
spear
the
caster
sits
far
off
from
any
fear
yet
if
thy
hurt
they
meant
i
can
do
this
loose
him
and
let
him
go
in
peace
from
me
i
will
not
slay
the
slayer
of
all
my
bliss
yet
go
poor
man
for
when
thy
face
i
see
i
curse
the
gods
for
their
felicity
surely
some
other
slayer
they
would
have
found
if
thou
hadst
long
ago
been
under
ground
alas
adrastus
in
my
inmost
heart
i
knew
the
gods
would
one
day
do
this
thing
but
deemed
indeed
that
it
would
be
thy
part
to
comfort
me
amidst
my
sorrowing
make
haste
to
go
for
i
am
still
a
king
madness
may
take
me
i
have
many
hands
who
will
not
spare
to
do
my
worst
commands
with
that
adrastus
bonds
were
done
away
and
forthwith
to
the
city
gates
he
ran
and
on
the
road
where
they
had
been
that
day
rushed
through
the
gathering
night
and
some
lone
man
beheld
next
day
his
visage
wild
and
wan
peering
from
out
a
thicket
of
the
wood
where
he
had
spilt
that
blood
and
now
the
day
of
burial
pomp
must
be
and
to
those
rites
all
lords
of
lydia
came
about
the
king
and
that
day
they
and
he
cast
royal
gifts
of
rich
things
on
the
flame
but
while
they
stood
and
wept
and
called
by
name
upon
the
dead
amidst
them
came
a
man
with
raiment
rent
and
haggard
face
and
wan
who
when
the
marshals
would
have
thrust
him
out
and
men
looked
strange
on
him
began
to
say
surely
the
world
is
changed
since
ye
have
doubt
of
who
i
am
nay
turn
me
not
away
for
ye
have
called
me
princely
ere
adrastus
son
of
gordius
a
great
king
where
unto
pallas
phrygian
maidens
sing
o
lydians
many
a
rich
thing
have
ye
cast
into
this
flame
but
i
myself
will
give
a
greater
gift
since
now
i
see
at
last
the
gods
are
wearied
for
that
still
i
live
and
with
their
will
why
should
i
longer
strive
atys
o
atys
thus
i
give
to
thee
a
life
that
lived
for
thy
felicity
and
therewith
from
his
side
a
knife
he
drew
and
crying
out
upon
the
pile
he
leapt
and
with
one
mighty
stroke
himself
he
slew
so
there
these
princes
both
together
slept
and
their
light
ashes
gathered
up
were
kept
within
a
golden
vessel
wrought
all
with
histories
of
this
hunting
of
the
boar
a
gentle
wind
had
risen
midst
his
tale
that
bore
the
sweet
scents
of
the
fertile
vale
in
at
the
open
windows
and
these
men
the
burden
of
their
years
scarce
noted
then
soothed
by
the
sweet
luxurious
summer
time
and
by
the
cadence
of
that
ancient
rhyme
spite
of
its
saddening
import
nay
indeed
of
some
such
thoughts
the
wanderers
had
need
as
that
tale
gave
them
yea
a
man
shall
be
a
wonder
for
his
glorious
chivalry
first
in
all
wisdom
of
a
prudent
mind
yet
none
the
less
him
too
his
fate
shall
find
unfenced
by
these
a
man
other
men
yea
and
will
fortune
pick
out
now
and
then
the
noblest
for
the
anvil
of
her
blows
great
names
are
few
and
yet
indeed
who
knows
what
greater
souls
have
fallen
the
stroke
of
careless
fate
purblind
are
most
of
folk
the
happy
are
the
masters
of
the
earth
which
ever
give
small
heed
to
hapless
worth
so
goes
the
world
and
this
we
needs
must
bear
like
eld
and
death
yet
there
were
some
men
there
who
drank
in
silence
to
the
memory
of
those
who
failed
on
earth
great
men
to
be
though
better
than
the
men
who
won
the
crown
but
when
the
sun
was
fairly
going
down
they
left
the
house
and
following
up
the
stream
in
the
low
sun
saw
the
kingfisher
gleam
bank
and
alder
and
the
grebe
steal
out
from
the
high
sedge
and
in
his
restless
doubt
dive
down
and
rise
to
see
what
men
were
there
they
saw
the
swallow
chase
high
up
in
air
the
circling
gnats
the
shaded
dusky
pool
broke
by
the
splashing
chub
the
ripple
cool
rising
and
falling
of
some
distant
weir
they
heard
till
it
oppressed
the
listening
ear
as
twilight
grew
so
back
they
turned
again
glad
of
their
rest
and
pleasure
after
pain
within
the
gardens
once
again
they
met
that
now
the
roses
did
forget
for
hot
july
was
drawing
to
an
end
and
august
came
the
fainting
year
to
mend
with
fruit
and
grain
so
the
trellises
nigh
blossomless
did
they
lie
well
at
ease
and
watched
the
poppies
burn
across
the
grass
and
the
bindweed
bells
the
brown
bee
pass
still
murmuring
of
his
gains
windless
and
bright
the
morn
had
been
to
help
their
dear
delight
but
heavy
clouds
ere
noon
grew
round
the
sun
and
halfway
to
the
zenith
wild
and
dun
the
sky
grew
and
the
thunder
growled
afar
but
ere
the
steely
clouds
began
their
war
a
change
there
came
and
as
by
some
great
hand
the
clouds
that
hung
in
threatening
the
land
were
drawn
away
then
a
light
wind
arose
that
shook
the
light
stems
of
that
flowery
close
and
made
men
sigh
for
pleasure
therewithal
did
mirth
upon
the
feasting
elders
fall
and
they
no
longer
watched
the
lowering
sky
but
called
aloud
for
some
new
history
then
spoke
the
suabian
sirs
this
tale
is
told
among
our
searchers
for
fine
stones
and
gold
and
though
i
tell
it
wrong
be
good
to
me
for
i
the
written
book
did
never
see
made
by
some
fleming
as
i
think
wherein
is
told
this
tale
of
wilfulness
and
sin
the
watching
of
the
falcon
argument
the
case
of
this
falcon
was
such
that
whoso
watched
it
without
sleeping
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
had
his
first
wish
granted
him
by
a
fay
lady
that
appeared
to
him
thereon
and
some
wished
one
thing
and
some
another
but
a
certain
king
who
watched
the
falcon
daily
would
wish
for
nought
but
the
love
of
that
fay
which
wish
being
accomplished
was
afterwards
his
ruin
across
the
sea
a
land
there
is
where
if
fate
will
may
men
have
bliss
for
it
is
fair
as
any
land
there
hath
the
reaper
a
full
hand
while
in
the
orchard
hangs
aloft
the
purple
fig
soft
and
fair
the
trellised
are
swung
across
the
high
and
in
the
rivers
great
fish
play
while
over
them
pass
day
by
day
the
laden
barges
to
their
place
there
maids
are
straight
and
fair
of
face
and
men
are
stout
for
husbandry
and
all
is
well
as
it
can
be
upon
this
earth
where
all
has
end
for
on
them
god
is
pleased
to
send
the
gift
of
death
down
from
above
that
envy
hatred
and
hot
love
knowledge
with
hunger
by
his
side
and
avarice
and
deadly
pride
there
may
have
end
like
everything
both
to
the
shepherd
and
the
king
lest
this
green
earth
become
but
hell
if
folk
for
ever
there
should
dwell
full
little
most
men
think
of
this
but
half
in
woe
and
half
in
bliss
they
pass
their
lives
and
die
at
last
unwilling
though
their
lot
be
cast
in
wretched
places
of
the
earth
where
men
have
little
joy
from
birth
until
they
die
in
no
such
case
were
those
who
tilled
this
pleasant
place
there
soothly
men
were
loth
to
die
though
sometimes
in
his
misery
a
man
would
say
would
i
were
dead
alas
full
little
likelihead
that
he
should
live
for
ever
there
so
folk
within
that
country
fair
lived
on
nor
from
their
memories
drave
the
thought
of
what
they
could
not
have
and
without
need
tormented
still
each
other
with
some
bitter
ill
yea
and
themselves
too
growing
grey
with
dread
of
some
day
that
never
came
ere
they
were
dead
with
green
sods
growing
on
the
head
nowise
content
with
what
they
had
but
falling
still
from
good
to
bad
while
hard
they
sought
the
hopeless
best
and
seldom
happy
or
at
rest
until
at
last
with
lessening
blood
one
foot
within
the
grave
they
stood
now
so
it
chanced
that
in
this
land
there
did
a
certain
castle
stand
set
all
alone
deep
in
the
hills
amid
the
sound
of
falling
rills
within
a
valley
of
sweet
grass
to
which
there
went
one
narrow
pass
through
the
dark
hills
but
seldom
trod
rarely
did
press
the
sod
about
the
quiet
weedy
moat
where
unscared
did
the
great
fish
float
because
men
dreaded
there
to
see
the
uncouth
things
of
faërie
nathless
by
some
few
fathers
old
these
tales
about
the
place
were
told
that
neither
squire
nor
seneschal
or
varlet
came
in
bower
or
hall
yet
all
things
were
in
order
due
hangings
of
gold
and
red
and
blue
and
tables
with
fair
service
set
cups
that
had
paid
the
cæsar
debt
could
he
have
laid
his
hands
on
them
dorsars
with
pearls
in
every
hem
and
fair
embroidered
things
fit
for
a
company
of
kings
and
in
the
chambers
dainty
beds
with
pillows
dight
for
fair
young
heads
and
horses
in
the
stables
were
and
in
the
cellars
wine
full
clear
and
strong
and
casks
of
ale
and
mead
yea
all
things
a
great
lord
could
need
for
whom
these
things
were
ready
there
none
knew
but
if
one
chanced
to
fare
into
that
place
at
there
would
he
find
a
falcon
tied
unto
a
pillar
of
the
hall
and
such
a
fate
to
him
would
fall
that
if
unto
the
seventh
night
he
watched
the
bird
from
dark
to
light
and
light
to
dark
unceasingly
on
the
last
evening
he
should
see
a
lady
beautiful
past
words
then
were
he
come
of
clowns
or
lords
son
of
a
swineherd
or
a
king
there
must
she
grant
him
anything
perforce
that
he
might
dare
to
ask
and
do
his
very
hardest
task
but
if
he
slumbered
again
the
wretch
would
wake
for
he
was
slain
helpless
by
hands
he
could
not
see
and
torn
and
mangled
wretchedly
now
said
these
elders
ere
this
tide
full
many
folk
this
thing
have
tried
but
few
have
got
much
good
thereby
for
first
a
many
came
to
die
by
slumbering
ere
their
watch
was
done
or
else
they
saw
that
lovely
one
and
mazed
they
knew
not
what
to
say
or
asked
some
toy
for
all
their
pay
that
easily
they
might
have
won
nor
staked
their
lives
and
souls
thereon
or
asking
asked
for
some
great
thing
that
was
their
bane
as
to
be
king
one
asked
and
died
the
morrow
morn
that
he
was
crowned
of
all
forlorn
yet
thither
came
a
certain
man
who
from
being
poor
great
riches
wan
past
telling
whose
grandsons
now
are
great
lords
thereby
in
peace
and
war
and
in
their
they
bear
upon
a
field
of
azure
fair
a
castle
and
a
falcon
set
below
a
chief
of
golden
fret
and
in
our
day
a
certain
knight
prayed
to
be
worsted
in
no
fight
and
so
it
happed
to
him
yet
he
died
none
the
less
most
wretchedly
and
all
his
prowess
was
in
vain
for
by
a
losel
was
he
slain
as
on
the
highway
side
he
slept
one
summer
night
of
no
man
kept
such
tales
as
these
the
fathers
old
about
that
lonely
castle
told
and
in
their
day
the
king
must
try
himself
to
prove
that
mystery
although
unless
the
fay
could
give
for
ever
on
the
earth
to
live
nought
could
he
ask
that
he
had
not
for
boundless
riches
had
he
got
fair
children
and
a
faithful
wife
and
happily
had
passed
his
life
and
all
fulfilled
of
victory
yet
was
he
fain
this
thing
to
see
so
towards
the
mountains
he
set
out
one
noontide
with
a
gallant
rout
of
knights
and
lords
and
as
the
day
began
to
fail
came
to
the
way
where
he
must
enter
all
alone
between
the
dreary
walls
of
stone
thereon
to
that
fair
company
he
bade
farewell
who
wistfully
looked
backward
oft
as
home
they
rode
but
in
the
entry
he
abode
of
that
rough
unknown
narrowing
pass
where
twilight
at
the
high
noon
was
then
onward
he
began
to
ride
smooth
rose
the
rocks
on
every
side
and
seemed
as
they
were
cut
by
man
adown
them
ever
water
ran
but
they
of
living
things
were
bare
yea
not
a
blade
of
grass
grew
there
and
underfoot
rough
was
the
way
for
scattered
all
about
there
lay
great
jagged
pieces
of
black
stone
throughout
the
pass
the
wind
did
moan
with
such
wild
noises
that
the
king
could
almost
think
he
heard
something
spoken
of
men
as
one
might
hear
the
voices
of
folk
standing
near
one
chamber
wall
yet
saw
he
nought
except
those
high
walls
strangely
wrought
and
overhead
the
strip
of
sky
so
going
onward
painfully
he
met
therein
no
evil
thing
but
came
about
the
unto
the
opening
of
the
pass
and
thence
beheld
a
vale
of
grass
bright
with
the
yellow
daffodil
and
all
the
vale
the
sun
did
fill
with
his
last
glory
midmost
there
rose
up
a
stronghold
built
upon
a
flowery
grassy
mound
that
moat
and
high
wall
ran
around
thereby
he
saw
a
walled
pleasance
with
walks
and
sward
fit
for
the
dance
of
arthur
court
in
its
best
time
that
seemed
to
feel
some
magic
clime
for
though
through
all
the
vale
outside
things
were
as
in
the
and
daffodils
and
cowslips
grew
and
hidden
the
march
violets
blew
within
the
bounds
of
that
sweet
close
was
trellised
the
bewildering
rose
there
was
the
lily
and
starry
pinks
for
garlands
meet
and
apricots
hung
on
the
wall
and
midst
the
flowers
did
peaches
fall
and
nought
had
blemish
there
or
spot
for
in
that
place
decay
was
not
silent
awhile
the
king
abode
beholding
all
then
on
he
rode
and
to
the
drew
nigh
till
fell
the
drawbridge
silently
and
when
across
it
he
did
ride
he
found
the
great
gates
open
wide
and
entered
there
but
as
he
passed
the
gates
were
shut
behind
him
fast
but
not
before
that
he
could
see
the
drawbridge
rise
up
silently
then
round
he
gazed
oppressed
with
awe
and
there
no
living
thing
he
saw
except
the
sparrows
in
the
eaves
as
restless
as
light
autumn
leaves
blown
by
the
fitful
rainy
wind
thereon
his
final
goal
to
find
he
lighted
off
his
good
and
let
him
wander
as
he
would
when
he
had
eased
him
of
his
gear
then
gathering
heart
against
his
fear
just
at
the
silent
end
of
day
through
the
fair
porch
he
took
his
way
and
found
at
last
a
goodly
hall
with
glorious
hangings
on
the
wall
inwrought
with
trees
of
every
clime
and
stories
of
the
ancient
time
but
all
of
sorcery
they
were
for
the
daïs
venus
fair
fluttered
about
by
many
a
dove
made
hopeless
men
for
hopeless
love
both
sick
and
sorry
there
they
stood
wrought
wonderfully
in
various
mood
but
wasted
all
by
that
hid
fire
of
measureless
desire
and
let
the
hurrying
world
go
by
forgetting
all
felicity
but
down
the
hall
the
tale
was
wrought
how
argo
in
old
time
was
brought
to
colchis
for
the
fleece
of
gold
and
on
the
other
side
was
told
how
mariners
for
long
years
came
to
circe
winning
grief
and
shame
until
at
last
by
hardihead
and
craft
ulysses
won
her
bed
long
upon
these
the
king
did
look
and
of
them
all
good
heed
he
took
to
see
if
they
would
tell
him
aught
about
the
matter
that
he
sought
but
all
were
of
the
times
long
past
so
going
all
about
at
last
when
grown
nigh
weary
of
his
search
a
falcon
on
a
silver
perch
anigh
the
daïs
did
he
see
and
wondered
because
certainly
at
his
first
coming
was
not
there
but
the
bird
a
scroll
most
fair
with
golden
letters
on
the
white
he
saw
and
in
the
dim
twilight
by
diligence
could
he
read
this
ye
who
have
not
enow
of
bliss
in
this
hard
world
labour
sore
manhood
here
may
get
you
more
be
fulfilled
of
everything
ye
be
masters
of
the
yet
since
i
who
promise
nowise
god
to
give
man
ending
now
in
time
beware
if
you
live
in
little
turn
aback
and
home
again
unknown
woe
ye
chance
to
wishing
for
a
thing
untried
a
little
while
did
he
abide
when
he
had
read
this
deep
in
thought
wondering
indeed
if
there
were
aught
he
had
not
got
that
a
wise
man
would
wish
yet
in
his
mind
it
ran
that
he
might
win
a
boundless
realm
yea
come
to
wear
upon
his
helm
the
crown
of
the
whole
conquered
earth
that
all
who
lived
thereon
from
birth
to
death
should
call
him
king
and
lord
and
great
kings
tremble
at
his
word
until
in
turn
he
came
to
die
therewith
a
little
did
he
sigh
but
thought
of
alexander
yet
men
talk
nor
would
they
forget
my
name
if
this
should
come
to
be
whoever
should
come
after
me
but
while
i
lay
wrapped
round
with
gold
should
tales
and
histories
manifold
be
written
of
me
false
and
true
and
as
the
time
still
onward
drew
almost
a
god
would
folk
count
me
saying
our
time
none
such
be
but
therewith
did
he
sigh
again
and
said
ah
vain
and
worse
than
vain
for
though
the
world
forget
me
nought
yet
by
that
time
should
i
be
brought
where
all
the
world
i
should
forget
and
bitterly
should
i
regret
that
i
from
godlike
great
renown
to
helpless
death
must
fall
adown
how
could
i
bear
to
leave
it
all
then
straight
upon
his
mind
did
fall
thoughts
of
old
longings
half
forgot
matters
for
which
his
heart
was
hot
a
while
ago
whereof
no
more
he
cared
for
some
and
some
right
sore
had
vexed
him
being
fulfilled
at
last
and
when
the
thought
of
these
had
passed
still
something
was
there
left
behind
that
by
no
torturing
of
his
mind
could
he
in
any
language
name
or
into
form
of
wishing
frame
at
last
he
thought
what
matters
it
before
these
seven
days
shall
flit
some
great
thing
surely
shall
i
find
that
gained
will
not
leave
grief
behind
nor
turn
to
deadly
injury
so
now
will
i
let
these
things
be
and
think
of
some
unknown
delight
now
therewithal
was
come
the
night
and
thus
his
watch
was
well
begun
and
till
the
rising
of
the
sun
waking
he
paced
about
the
hall
and
saw
the
hangings
on
the
wall
fade
into
nought
and
then
grow
white
in
patches
by
the
pale
moonlight
and
then
again
fade
utterly
as
still
the
moonbeams
passed
them
by
then
in
a
while
with
hope
of
day
begin
a
little
to
grow
grey
until
familiar
things
they
grew
as
up
at
last
the
great
sun
drew
and
lit
them
with
his
yellow
light
at
ending
of
another
night
then
right
glad
was
he
of
the
day
that
passed
with
him
in
way
for
neither
man
nor
beast
came
near
nor
any
voices
did
he
hear
and
when
again
it
drew
to
night
silent
it
passed
till
first
twilight
of
morning
came
and
then
he
heard
the
feeble
twittering
of
some
bird
that
in
that
utter
silence
drear
smote
harsh
and
startling
on
his
ear
therewith
came
on
that
lonely
day
that
passed
him
in
no
other
way
and
thus
six
days
and
nights
went
by
and
nothing
strange
had
come
anigh
and
on
that
day
he
deemed
that
all
that
story
had
been
dreamed
daylight
and
dark
and
night
and
day
passed
ever
in
their
wonted
way
the
wind
played
in
the
trees
outside
the
rooks
from
out
the
high
trees
cried
and
all
seemed
natural
frank
and
fair
with
little
signs
of
magic
there
yet
neither
could
he
quite
forget
that
close
with
summer
blossoms
set
and
fruit
hung
on
trees
blossoming
when
all
about
was
early
spring
yea
if
all
this
by
man
were
made
strange
was
it
that
yet
undecayed
the
food
lay
on
the
tables
still
unchanged
by
man
that
wine
did
fill
the
golden
cups
yet
bright
and
red
and
all
was
so
apparelléd
for
guests
that
came
not
yet
was
all
as
though
that
servants
filled
the
hall
so
waxed
and
waned
his
hopes
and
still
he
formed
no
wish
for
good
or
and
while
he
thought
of
this
and
that
upon
his
perch
the
falcon
sat
unfed
unhooded
his
bright
eyes
beholders
of
the
prize
glancing
around
him
restlessly
as
though
he
knew
the
time
drew
nigh
when
this
long
watching
should
be
done
so
little
by
little
fell
the
sun
from
high
noon
unto
and
in
that
lapse
of
time
the
king
though
still
he
woke
yet
none
the
less
was
dreaming
in
his
sleeplessness
of
this
and
that
which
he
had
done
before
this
watch
he
had
begun
till
with
a
start
he
looked
at
last
about
him
and
all
dreams
were
past
for
now
though
it
was
past
twilight
without
within
all
grew
as
bright
as
when
the
smote
the
wall
though
no
lamp
shone
within
the
hall
then
rose
the
king
upon
his
feet
and
heard
his
own
heart
beat
and
grew
all
pale
for
hope
and
fear
as
sound
of
footsteps
caught
his
ear
but
soft
and
as
some
fair
lady
going
as
gently
as
might
be
stopped
now
and
then
awhile
distraught
by
pleasant
wanderings
of
sweet
thought
nigher
the
sound
came
and
more
nigh
until
the
king
unwittingly
trembled
and
felt
his
hair
arise
but
on
the
door
still
kept
his
eyes
that
opened
soon
and
in
the
light
there
stepped
alone
a
lady
bright
and
made
straight
toward
him
up
the
hall
in
golden
garments
was
she
clad
and
round
her
waist
a
belt
she
had
of
emeralds
fair
and
from
her
feet
that
shod
with
gold
the
floor
did
meet
she
held
the
raiment
daintily
and
on
her
golden
head
had
she
a
round
a
crown
softly
she
walked
with
eyes
cast
down
nor
looked
she
any
other
than
an
earthly
lady
though
no
man
has
seen
so
fair
a
thing
as
she
so
when
her
face
the
king
could
see
still
more
he
trembled
and
he
thought
surely
my
wish
is
hither
brought
and
this
will
be
a
goodly
day
if
for
mine
own
i
win
this
may
and
therewithal
she
drew
anear
until
the
trembling
king
could
hear
her
very
breathing
and
she
raised
her
head
and
on
the
king
face
gazed
with
serious
eyes
and
stopping
there
swept
from
her
shoulders
her
long
hair
and
let
her
gown
fall
on
her
feet
then
spoke
in
a
clear
voice
and
sweet
well
hast
thou
watched
so
now
o
king
be
bold
and
wish
for
some
good
thing
and
yet
i
counsel
thee
be
wise
behold
spite
of
these
lips
and
eyes
hundreds
of
years
old
now
am
i
and
have
seen
joy
and
misery
and
thou
who
yet
hast
lived
in
bliss
i
bid
thee
well
consider
this
better
it
were
that
men
should
live
as
beasts
and
take
what
earth
can
give
the
air
the
warm
sun
and
the
grass
until
unto
the
earth
they
pass
and
gain
perchance
nought
worse
than
rest
than
that
not
knowing
what
is
best
for
sons
of
men
they
needs
must
thirst
for
what
shall
make
their
lives
accurst
therefore
i
bid
thee
now
beware
lest
getting
something
seeming
fair
thou
in
vain
to
long
for
more
or
lest
the
thing
thou
wishest
for
make
thee
unhappy
till
thou
diest
or
lest
with
speedy
death
thou
buyest
a
little
hour
of
happiness
or
lazy
joy
with
sharp
distress
alas
why
say
i
this
to
thee
for
now
i
see
full
certainly
that
thou
wilt
ask
for
such
a
thing
it
had
been
best
for
thee
to
fling
thy
body
from
a
or
in
a
white
hot
fire
to
drop
or
ever
thou
hadst
seen
me
here
nay
then
be
speedy
and
speak
clear
then
the
king
cried
out
eagerly
grown
fearless
ah
be
kind
to
me
thou
knowest
what
i
long
for
then
thou
that
i
a
king
of
men
will
ask
for
nothing
else
than
thee
thou
didst
not
say
this
could
not
be
and
i
have
had
enough
of
bliss
if
i
may
end
my
life
with
this
hearken
she
said
what
men
will
say
when
they
are
mad
before
i
knew
that
words
such
things
could
mean
and
wondered
that
it
could
have
been
think
well
because
this
joy
that
surely
will
thy
bliss
destroy
will
let
thee
live
until
thy
life
is
wrapped
in
such
bewildering
strife
that
all
thy
days
will
seem
but
ill
now
wilt
thou
wish
for
this
thing
still
wilt
thou
then
grant
it
cried
the
king
surely
thou
art
an
earthly
thing
and
all
this
is
but
mockery
and
thou
canst
tell
no
more
than
i
what
ending
to
my
life
shall
be
nay
then
she
said
i
grant
it
thee
perforce
come
nigh
for
i
am
thine
until
the
morning
sun
doth
shine
and
only
coming
time
can
prove
what
thing
i
am
dizzy
with
love
and
with
surprise
struck
motionless
that
this
divine
thing
with
far
less
of
striving
than
a
village
maid
had
yielded
there
he
stood
afraid
spite
of
hot
words
and
passionate
and
strove
to
think
upon
his
fate
but
as
he
stood
there
presently
with
smiling
face
she
drew
anigh
and
on
his
face
he
felt
her
breath
o
love
she
said
dost
thou
fear
death
not
till
next
morning
shalt
thou
die
or
fall
into
thy
misery
then
on
his
hand
her
hand
did
fall
and
forth
she
led
him
down
the
hall
going
full
softly
by
his
side
o
love
she
said
now
well
betide
the
day
whereon
thou
to
me
i
would
this
night
a
year
might
be
yea
such
life
as
we
have
a
thousand
years
from
womb
to
grave
and
then
that
clinging
hand
seemed
worth
whatever
joy
was
left
on
earth
and
every
trouble
he
forgot
and
time
and
death
remembered
not
kinder
she
grew
she
clung
to
him
with
loving
arms
her
eyes
did
swim
with
love
and
pity
as
he
strove
to
show
the
wisdom
of
his
love
with
trembling
lips
she
praised
his
choice
and
said
ah
well
thou
rejoice
well
thou
think
this
one
short
night
worth
years
of
other
men
delight
if
thy
heart
as
mine
own
heart
is
sunk
in
a
boundless
sea
of
bliss
o
love
rejoice
with
me
rejoice
but
as
she
spoke
her
honied
voice
trembled
and
midst
of
sobs
she
said
o
love
and
art
thou
still
afraid
return
then
to
thine
happiness
nor
will
i
love
thee
any
less
but
watch
thee
as
a
mother
might
her
child
at
play
with
strange
delight
he
stammered
out
nay
keep
thy
tears
for
me
and
for
my
ruined
years
weep
love
that
i
may
love
thee
more
my
little
hour
will
soon
be
ah
love
she
said
and
thou
art
wise
as
men
are
with
long
miseries
buying
these
idle
words
and
vain
my
foolish
love
with
lasting
pain
and
yet
thou
wouldst
have
died
at
last
if
in
all
wisdom
thou
hadst
passed
thy
weary
life
forgive
me
then
in
pitying
the
sad
life
of
men
then
in
such
bliss
his
soul
did
swim
but
tender
music
unto
him
her
words
were
death
and
misery
but
empty
names
were
grown
to
be
as
from
that
place
his
steps
she
drew
and
dark
the
hall
behind
them
grew
but
end
comes
to
all
earthly
bliss
and
by
his
choice
full
short
was
his
and
in
the
morning
grey
and
cold
beside
the
daïs
did
she
hold
his
trembling
hand
and
wistfully
he
doubting
what
his
fate
should
be
gazed
at
her
solemn
eyes
that
now
beneath
her
calm
untroubled
brow
were
fixed
on
his
wild
face
and
wan
at
last
she
said
oh
hapless
man
depart
thy
full
wish
hast
thou
had
a
little
time
thou
hast
been
glad
thou
shalt
be
sorry
till
thou
die
and
though
indeed
full
fain
am
i
this
might
not
be
nathless
as
day
night
follows
colourless
and
grey
so
this
shall
follow
thy
delight
your
joy
hath
ending
with
last
night
nay
peace
and
hearken
to
thy
fate
strife
without
peace
early
and
late
lasting
long
after
thou
art
dead
and
laid
with
earth
upon
thine
head
war
without
victory
shalt
thou
have
defeat
nor
honour
shalt
thou
save
thy
fair
land
shall
be
rent
and
torn
thy
people
be
of
all
forlorn
and
all
men
curse
thee
for
this
thing
she
loosed
his
hand
but
yet
the
king
said
yea
and
i
may
go
with
thee
why
should
we
part
then
let
things
be
as
they
will
poor
man
she
said
thou
ravest
our
hot
love
is
dead
if
ever
it
had
any
life
go
make
thee
ready
for
the
strife
wherein
thy
days
shall
soon
be
wrapped
and
of
the
things
that
here
have
happed
make
thou
such
joy
as
thou
do
but
i
from
this
place
needs
must
go
nor
shalt
thou
ever
see
me
more
until
thy
troubled
life
is
alas
i
to
say
to
thee
were
nought
but
bitter
mockery
fare
as
thou
and
with
good
heart
play
to
the
end
thy
wretched
part
therewith
she
turned
and
went
from
him
and
with
such
pain
his
eyes
did
swim
he
scarce
could
see
her
leave
the
place
and
then
with
troubled
and
pale
face
he
gat
him
thence
and
soon
he
found
his
good
horse
in
the
bound
so
loosing
him
forth
did
he
ride
for
the
great
gates
were
open
wide
and
flat
the
heavy
drawbridge
lay
so
by
the
middle
of
the
day
that
murky
pass
had
he
gone
through
and
come
to
country
that
he
knew
and
homeward
turned
his
horse
head
and
passing
village
and
homestead
nigh
to
his
palace
came
at
last
and
still
the
further
that
he
passed
from
that
strange
castle
of
the
fays
more
dreamlike
seemed
those
seven
days
and
dreamlike
the
delicious
night
and
like
a
dream
the
shoulders
white
and
clinging
arms
and
yellow
hair
and
dreamlike
the
sad
morning
there
until
at
last
he
to
deem
that
all
might
well
have
been
a
dream
yet
why
was
life
a
weariness
what
meant
this
sting
of
sharp
distress
this
longing
for
a
hopeless
love
no
sighing
from
his
heart
could
move
or
else
did
not
come
and
go
as
fays
might
do
but
soft
and
slow
her
lovely
feet
fell
on
the
floor
she
set
her
fair
hand
to
the
door
as
any
dainty
maid
might
do
and
though
indeed
there
are
but
few
beneath
the
sun
as
fair
as
she
she
seemed
a
fleshly
thing
to
be
perchance
a
merry
mock
this
is
and
i
may
some
day
have
the
bliss
to
see
her
lovely
face
again
as
smiling
she
makes
all
things
plain
and
then
as
i
am
still
a
king
with
me
may
she
make
tarrying
full
long
yea
till
i
come
to
die
therewith
at
last
being
come
anigh
unto
his
very
palace
gate
he
saw
his
knights
and
squires
wait
his
coming
therefore
on
the
ground
he
lighted
and
they
flocked
around
till
he
should
tell
them
of
his
fare
then
mocking
said
he
ye
may
dare
the
worst
man
of
you
all
to
go
and
watch
as
i
was
bold
to
do
for
nought
i
heard
except
the
wind
and
nought
i
saw
to
call
to
mind
so
said
he
but
they
noted
well
that
something
more
he
had
to
tell
if
it
had
pleased
him
one
old
man
beholding
his
changed
face
and
wan
muttered
would
god
it
might
be
so
alas
i
fear
what
fate
may
do
too
much
good
fortune
hast
thou
had
by
anything
to
be
more
glad
than
thou
hast
been
i
fear
thee
then
lest
thou
a
curse
to
men
but
to
his
place
the
doomed
king
passed
and
all
remembrance
strove
to
cast
from
out
his
mind
of
that
past
day
and
spent
his
life
in
sport
and
play
great
among
other
kings
i
said
he
was
before
he
first
was
led
unto
that
castle
of
the
fays
but
soon
he
lost
his
happy
days
and
all
his
goodly
life
was
done
and
first
indeed
his
son
the
very
apple
of
his
eye
waged
war
against
him
bitterly
and
when
this
son
was
overcome
and
taken
and
folk
led
him
home
and
him
the
king
had
gone
to
meet
meaning
with
gentle
words
and
sweet
to
win
him
to
his
love
again
by
his
own
hand
he
found
him
slain
i
know
not
if
the
doomed
king
yet
remembered
the
fay
lady
threat
but
troubles
upon
troubles
came
his
daughter
next
was
brought
to
shame
who
unto
all
eyes
seemed
to
be
the
image
of
all
purity
and
fleeing
from
the
royal
place
the
king
no
more
beheld
her
face
then
next
a
folk
that
came
from
far
sent
to
the
king
great
threats
of
war
but
he
of
victory
deemed
this
a
little
thing
to
be
and
thought
the
troubles
of
his
home
thereby
he
well
might
overcome
amid
the
hurry
of
the
fight
his
foemen
seemed
of
little
might
although
they
thronged
like
summer
bees
about
the
outlying
villages
and
on
the
land
great
ruin
brought
well
he
this
barbarous
people
sought
with
such
an
army
as
seemed
meet
to
put
the
world
beneath
his
feet
the
day
of
battle
came
and
he
flushed
with
the
hope
of
victory
grew
happy
as
he
had
not
been
since
he
those
glorious
eyes
had
seen
they
met
his
solid
ranks
of
steel
there
scarcely
more
the
darts
could
feel
of
those
new
foemen
than
if
they
had
been
a
hundred
miles
away
they
met
a
storied
folk
were
his
to
whom
sharp
war
had
long
been
bliss
a
thousand
years
of
memories
were
flashing
in
their
shielded
eyes
and
grave
philosophers
they
had
to
bid
them
ever
to
be
glad
to
meet
their
death
and
get
life
done
midst
glorious
deeds
from
sire
to
son
and
those
they
met
were
beasts
or
worse
to
whom
life
seemed
a
jest
a
curse
of
fame
and
name
they
had
not
heard
honour
to
them
was
but
a
word
a
word
spoke
in
another
tongue
no
memories
round
their
banners
clung
no
walls
they
knew
no
art
of
war
by
hunger
were
they
driven
afar
unto
the
place
whereon
they
stood
ravening
for
bestial
joys
and
blood
no
wonder
if
these
barbarous
men
were
slain
by
hundreds
to
each
ten
of
the
king
brave
folk
no
wonder
if
their
charges
broke
to
nothing
on
the
walls
of
steel
and
back
the
baffled
hordes
must
reel
so
stood
throughout
a
summer
day
scarce
touched
the
king
most
fair
array
yet
as
it
drew
to
the
foe
still
surged
on
every
side
as
hopeless
men
about
his
folk
grown
wearied
then
therewith
the
king
beheld
that
crowd
howling
and
dusk
and
cried
aloud
what
do
ye
warriors
and
how
long
shall
weak
folk
hold
in
check
the
strong
nay
forward
banners
end
the
day
and
show
these
folk
how
brave
men
play
the
young
knights
shouted
at
his
word
but
the
old
folk
in
terror
heard
the
shouting
run
adown
the
line
and
saw
men
flush
as
if
with
wine
o
sire
they
said
the
day
is
sure
nor
will
these
folk
the
night
endure
beset
with
misery
and
fears
alas
i
they
spoke
to
heedless
ears
for
scarce
one
look
on
them
he
cast
but
forward
through
the
ranks
he
passed
and
cried
out
who
will
follow
me
to
win
a
fruitful
victory
and
toward
the
foe
in
haste
he
spurred
and
at
his
back
their
shouts
he
heard
such
shouts
as
he
heard
again
they
met
ere
moonrise
all
the
plain
was
filled
by
men
in
hurrying
flight
the
relics
of
that
shameful
fight
the
close
array
the
men
the
ancient
fame
availed
not
then
the
dark
night
only
was
a
friend
to
bring
that
slaughter
to
an
end
and
surely
there
the
king
had
died
but
driven
by
that
tide
against
his
will
he
needs
must
flee
and
as
he
pondered
bitterly
on
all
that
wreck
that
he
had
wrought
from
time
to
time
indeed
he
thought
of
the
fay
woman
dreadful
threat
but
everything
was
not
lost
yet
next
day
he
said
great
was
the
rout
and
shameful
beyond
any
doubt
but
since
indeed
at
eventide
the
flight
began
not
many
died
and
gathering
all
the
stragglers
now
his
troops
still
made
a
gallant
show
alas
it
was
a
show
indeed
himself
desponding
did
he
lead
his
beaten
men
against
the
foe
thinking
at
least
to
lie
alow
before
the
final
rout
should
be
but
scarce
upon
the
enemy
could
these
whose
shaken
banners
shook
the
frightened
world
now
dare
to
look
nor
yet
could
the
doomed
king
die
there
a
death
he
once
had
held
most
fair
amid
unwounded
men
he
came
back
to
his
city
bent
with
shame
unkingly
midst
his
great
distress
yea
weeping
at
the
bitterness
of
women
curses
that
did
greet
his
passage
down
the
troubled
street
but
sight
of
all
the
things
they
loved
the
memory
of
their
manhood
moved
within
the
folk
and
aged
men
and
boys
must
think
of
battle
then
and
men
that
had
not
seen
the
foe
must
clamour
to
the
war
to
go
so
a
great
army
poured
once
more
from
out
the
city
and
before
the
very
gates
they
fought
again
but
their
late
valour
was
in
vain
they
died
indeed
and
that
was
good
but
nought
they
gained
for
all
the
blood
poured
out
like
water
for
the
foe
men
might
have
stayed
a
while
ago
a
match
for
very
gods
were
grown
so
like
the
field
in
mown
the
king
men
fell
and
but
in
vain
the
remnant
strove
the
town
to
gain
whose
battlements
were
nought
to
stay
an
untaught
foe
upon
that
day
though
many
a
tale
the
annals
told
of
sieges
in
the
days
of
old
when
all
the
world
then
knew
of
war
from
that
fair
place
was
driven
afar
as
for
the
king
a
charmed
life
he
seemed
to
bear
from
out
that
strife
he
came
unhurt
and
he
could
see
as
down
the
valley
he
did
flee
with
his
most
wretched
company
his
palace
flaming
to
the
sky
then
in
the
very
midst
of
woe
his
yearning
thoughts
would
backward
go
unto
the
castle
of
the
fay
he
muttered
shall
i
curse
that
day
the
last
delight
that
i
have
had
for
certainly
i
then
was
glad
and
who
knows
if
what
men
call
bliss
had
been
much
better
now
than
this
when
i
am
hastening
to
the
end
that
fearful
rest
that
dreaded
friend
that
death
he
did
not
gain
as
yet
a
band
of
men
he
soon
did
get
a
ruined
rout
of
bad
and
good
with
whom
within
the
tangled
wood
the
rugged
mountain
he
abode
and
thenceforth
oftentimes
they
rode
into
the
fair
land
once
called
his
and
yet
but
little
came
of
this
except
more
woe
for
heaven
to
see
some
little
added
misery
unto
that
miserable
realm
the
barbarous
foe
did
overwhelm
the
cities
and
the
fertile
plain
and
many
a
peaceful
man
was
slain
and
many
a
maiden
brought
to
shame
and
yielded
towns
were
set
aflame
for
all
the
land
was
masterless
long
dwelt
the
king
in
great
distress
from
wood
to
mountain
ever
tost
mourning
for
all
that
he
had
lost
until
it
chanced
upon
a
day
asleep
in
early
morn
he
lay
and
in
a
vision
there
did
see
clad
all
in
black
that
fay
lady
whereby
all
this
had
come
to
pass
but
dim
as
in
a
misty
glass
she
said
i
come
thy
death
to
tell
yet
now
to
thee
may
say
for
in
a
short
space
wilt
thou
be
within
an
endless
dim
country
where
thou
well
win
woe
or
bliss
therewith
she
stooped
his
lips
to
kiss
and
vanished
straightway
from
his
sight
so
waking
there
he
sat
upright
and
looked
around
but
nought
could
see
and
heard
but
melody
for
that
was
the
first
break
of
day
then
with
a
sigh
adown
he
lay
and
slept
nor
ever
woke
again
for
in
that
hour
was
he
slain
by
stealthy
traitors
as
he
slept
he
of
a
few
was
much
bewept
but
of
most
men
was
well
forgot
while
the
town
ashes
still
were
hot
the
foeman
on
that
day
did
burn
as
for
the
land
great
time
did
turn
the
bloody
fields
to
deep
green
grass
and
from
the
minds
of
men
did
pass
the
memory
of
that
time
of
woe
and
at
this
day
all
things
are
so
as
first
i
said
a
land
it
is
where
men
may
dwell
in
rest
and
bliss
if
so
they
will
who
yet
will
not
because
their
hasty
hearts
are
hot
with
foolish
hate
and
longing
vain
the
sire
and
dam
of
grief
and
pain
neath
the
bright
sky
cool
grew
the
weary
earth
and
many
a
bud
in
that
fair
hour
had
birth
upon
the
garden
bushes
in
the
west
the
sky
got
ready
for
the
great
sun
rest
and
all
was
fresh
and
lovely
none
the
less
although
those
old
men
shared
the
happiness
of
the
bright
eve
was
mixed
with
memories
of
how
they
might
in
old
times
have
been
wise
not
casting
by
for
very
wilfulness
what
wealth
might
come
their
changing
life
to
bless
lulling
their
hearts
to
sleep
amid
the
cold
of
bitter
times
that
so
they
might
behold
some
joy
at
last
if
it
lingered
long
that
wearing
not
their
souls
with
grief
and
wrong
they
still
might
watch
the
changing
world
go
by
content
to
live
content
at
last
to
die
alas
if
they
had
reached
content
at
last
it
was
perforce
when
all
their
strength
was
past
and
after
loss
of
many
days
once
bright
with
foolish
hopes
of
unattained
delight
august
across
the
gap
made
by
our
english
hinds
amidst
the
roman
handiwork
behold
far
off
the
church
the
shepherd
binds
the
withy
round
the
hurdles
of
his
fold
down
in
the
foss
the
river
fed
of
old
that
through
long
lapse
of
time
has
grown
to
be
the
little
grassy
valley
that
you
see
rest
here
awhile
not
yet
the
eve
is
still
the
bees
are
wandering
yet
and
you
may
hear
the
barley
mowers
on
the
trenchéd
hill
the
and
the
restless
changing
weir
all
little
sounds
made
musical
and
clear
beneath
the
sky
that
burning
august
gives
while
yet
the
thought
of
glorious
summer
lives
ah
love
such
happy
days
such
days
as
these
must
we
still
waste
them
craving
for
the
best
like
lovers
the
painted
images
of
those
who
once
their
yearning
hearts
have
blessed
have
we
been
happy
on
our
day
of
rest
thine
eyes
say
yes
but
if
it
came
again
perchance
its
ending
would
not
seem
so
vain
now
came
fulfilment
of
the
year
desire
the
tall
wheat
coloured
by
the
august
fire
grew
dreading
its
decay
and
blacker
grew
the
day
by
day
about
the
edges
of
the
yellow
corn
and
the
gardens
grown
somewhat
outworn
the
bees
went
hurrying
to
fill
up
their
store
the
bent
over
more
and
more
with
peach
and
apricot
the
garden
wall
was
odorous
and
the
pears
began
to
fall
from
off
the
high
tree
with
each
freshening
breeze
so
in
a
house
bordered
about
with
trees
a
little
raised
above
the
waving
gold
the
wanderers
heard
this
marvellous
story
told
while
the
gleaming
flasks
of
ancient
wine
they
watched
the
reapers
slow
advancing
line
pygmalion
and
the
image
argument
a
man
of
cyprus
a
sculptor
named
pygmalion
made
an
image
of
a
woman
fairer
than
any
that
had
yet
been
seen
and
in
the
end
came
to
love
his
own
handiwork
as
though
it
had
been
alive
wherefore
praying
to
venus
for
help
he
obtained
his
end
for
she
made
the
image
alive
indeed
and
a
woman
and
pygmalion
wedded
her
at
amathus
that
from
the
southern
side
of
cyprus
looks
across
the
syrian
sea
there
did
in
ancient
time
a
man
abide
known
to
the
for
that
he
had
wrought
most
godlike
works
in
imagery
and
day
by
day
still
greater
honour
won
which
man
our
old
books
call
pygmalion
yet
in
the
praise
of
men
small
joy
he
had
but
walked
abroad
with
downcast
brooding
face
nor
yet
by
any
damsel
was
made
glad
for
sooth
to
say
the
women
of
that
place
must
seem
to
all
men
an
accursed
race
who
with
the
turner
of
all
hearts
once
strove
and
now
their
hearts
must
carry
lust
for
love
upon
a
day
it
chanced
that
he
had
been
about
the
streets
and
on
the
crowded
quays
rich
with
unopened
wealth
of
bales
had
seen
the
merchants
of
the
southern
seas
in
chaffer
with
the
base
propoetides
and
gat
him
home
again
his
life
grown
idle
poor
and
vain
and
there
upon
his
images
he
cast
his
weary
eyes
yet
little
noted
them
as
still
from
name
to
name
his
swift
thought
passed
for
what
to
him
was
juno
hem
diana
shaft
or
pallas
what
help
could
hermes
rod
unto
him
give
until
with
shadowy
things
he
came
to
live
yet
note
that
though
while
looking
on
the
sun
the
craftsman
his
work
some
morn
of
spring
may
chide
his
useless
labour
never
done
for
all
his
murmurs
with
no
other
thing
he
soothes
his
heart
and
dulls
thought
poisonous
sting
and
thus
in
thought
despite
the
world
goes
on
and
so
it
was
with
this
pygmalion
unto
the
chisel
must
he
set
his
hand
and
slowly
still
in
troubled
thought
must
pace
about
a
work
begun
that
there
doth
stand
and
still
returning
to
the
place
unto
the
image
now
must
set
his
face
and
with
a
sigh
his
wonted
toil
begin
a
little
rest
to
win
the
lessening
marble
that
he
worked
upon
a
woman
form
now
imaged
doubtfully
and
in
such
guise
the
work
had
he
begun
because
when
he
the
untouched
block
did
see
in
wandering
veins
that
form
there
seemed
to
be
whereon
he
cried
out
in
a
careless
mood
o
lady
venus
make
this
presage
good
and
then
this
block
of
stone
shall
be
thy
maid
and
not
without
rich
golden
ornament
shall
bide
within
thy
quivering
so
spoke
he
but
the
goddess
well
content
unto
his
hand
such
godlike
mastery
sent
that
like
the
first
artificer
he
wrought
who
made
the
gift
that
woe
to
all
men
brought
and
yet
but
such
as
he
was
wont
to
do
at
first
indeed
that
work
divine
he
deemed
and
as
the
white
chips
from
the
chisel
flew
of
other
matters
languidly
he
dreamed
for
easy
to
his
hand
that
labour
seemed
and
he
was
stirred
with
many
a
troubling
thought
and
many
a
doubt
perplexed
him
as
he
wrought
and
yet
again
at
last
there
came
a
day
when
smoother
and
more
shapely
grew
the
stone
and
he
grown
eager
put
all
thought
away
but
that
which
touched
his
craftsmanship
alone
and
he
would
gaze
at
what
his
hands
had
done
until
his
heart
with
boundless
joy
would
swell
that
all
was
wrought
so
wonderfully
well
yet
long
it
was
ere
he
was
satisfied
and
with
the
pride
that
by
his
mastery
this
thing
was
done
whose
equal
far
and
wide
in
no
town
of
the
world
a
man
could
see
came
burning
longing
that
the
work
should
be
better
still
and
to
his
heart
there
came
a
strange
and
strong
desire
he
could
not
name
the
night
seemed
long
and
long
the
twilight
seemed
a
vain
thing
seemed
his
flowery
garden
fair
though
through
the
night
still
of
his
work
he
dreamed
and
though
his
trees
so
nigh
it
were
that
thence
he
could
behold
the
marble
hair
nought
was
enough
until
with
steel
in
hand
he
came
before
the
wondrous
stone
to
stand
no
song
could
charm
him
and
no
histories
of
men
misdoings
could
avail
him
now
nay
scarcely
seaward
had
he
turned
his
eyes
if
men
had
said
the
fierce
tyrrhenians
row
up
through
the
bay
rise
up
and
strike
a
blow
for
life
and
goods
for
nought
to
him
seemed
dear
but
to
his
work
to
be
anear
then
vexed
he
grew
and
knowing
not
his
heart
unto
himself
he
said
ah
what
is
this
that
i
who
oft
was
happy
to
depart
and
wander
where
the
boughs
each
other
kiss
the
west
wind
now
have
no
other
bliss
but
in
vain
smoothing
of
this
marble
maid
whose
chips
this
month
a
drachma
had
outweighed
lo
i
will
get
me
to
the
woods
and
try
if
i
my
woodcraft
have
forgotten
quite
and
then
returning
lay
this
folly
by
and
eat
my
fill
and
sleep
my
sleep
anight
and
to
carve
a
hercules
aright
upon
the
morrow
and
perchance
indeed
the
theban
will
be
good
to
me
at
need
with
that
he
took
his
quiver
and
his
bow
and
through
the
gates
of
amathus
he
went
and
toward
the
mountain
slopes
began
to
go
within
the
woods
to
work
out
his
intent
fair
was
the
day
the
honied
beanfield
scent
the
west
wind
bore
unto
him
the
way
the
glittering
noisy
poplar
leaves
did
play
all
things
were
moving
as
his
hurried
feet
passed
by
within
the
flowery
swathe
he
heard
the
sweeping
of
the
scythe
the
swallow
fleet
rose
over
him
the
sitting
partridge
stirred
on
the
field
edge
the
brown
bee
by
him
whirred
or
murmured
in
the
clover
flowers
below
but
he
with
head
failed
not
to
go
at
last
he
stopped
and
looking
round
he
said
like
one
whose
thirtieth
year
is
well
gone
by
the
day
is
getting
ready
to
be
dead
no
rest
and
on
the
border
of
the
sky
already
the
great
banks
of
dark
haze
lie
no
rest
what
do
i
midst
this
stir
and
noise
what
part
have
i
in
these
unthinking
joys
with
that
he
turned
and
toward
the
through
the
sweet
fields
went
swifter
than
he
came
and
cast
his
heart
into
the
hands
of
fate
nor
strove
with
it
when
higher
to
flame
that
strange
and
strong
desire
without
a
name
till
panting
thinking
of
nought
else
once
more
his
hand
was
on
the
latch
of
his
own
door
one
moment
there
he
lingered
as
he
said
alas
what
should
i
do
if
she
were
gone
but
even
with
that
word
his
brow
waxed
red
to
hear
his
own
lips
name
a
thing
of
stone
as
though
the
gods
some
marvel
there
had
done
and
made
his
work
alive
and
therewithal
in
turn
great
pallor
on
his
face
did
fall
but
with
a
sigh
he
passed
into
the
house
yet
even
then
his
must
hold
and
listen
there
half
blind
and
timorous
until
his
heart
should
wax
a
little
bold
then
entering
motionless
and
white
and
cold
he
saw
the
image
stand
amidst
the
floor
all
whitened
now
by
labour
done
before
blinded
with
tears
his
chisel
up
he
caught
and
drawing
near
and
sighing
tenderly
upon
the
marvel
of
the
face
he
wrought
as
he
used
to
pass
the
long
days
by
but
his
sighs
changed
to
sobbing
presently
and
on
the
floor
the
useless
steel
he
flung
and
weeping
loud
about
the
image
clung
alas
he
cried
why
have
i
made
thee
then
that
thus
thou
mockest
me
i
know
indeed
that
many
such
as
thou
are
loved
of
men
whose
passionate
eyes
poor
wretches
still
will
lead
into
their
net
and
smile
to
see
them
bleed
but
these
the
god
made
and
this
hand
made
thee
who
wilt
not
speak
one
little
word
to
me
then
from
the
image
did
he
draw
aback
to
gaze
on
it
through
tears
and
you
had
said
regarding
it
that
little
did
it
lack
to
be
a
living
and
most
lovely
maid
naked
it
was
its
unbound
locks
were
laid
over
the
lovely
shoulders
with
one
hand
reached
out
as
to
a
lover
did
it
stand
the
other
held
a
fair
rose
no
smile
was
on
the
parted
lips
the
eyes
seemed
as
if
even
now
great
love
had
shown
unto
them
something
of
its
sweet
surprise
yet
saddened
them
with
mysteries
and
still
midst
passion
she
seemed
as
though
of
love
unchanged
for
aye
she
dreamed
reproachfully
beholding
all
her
grace
pygmalion
stood
until
he
grew
and
then
at
last
he
turned
away
his
face
as
if
from
her
cold
eyes
his
grief
to
hide
and
thus
a
weary
while
did
he
abide
with
nothing
in
his
heart
but
vain
desire
the
unconsuming
fire
but
when
again
he
turned
his
visage
round
his
eyes
were
brighter
and
no
more
he
wept
as
if
some
little
solace
he
had
found
although
his
folly
none
the
more
had
slept
rather
some
madness
kept
his
other
madness
from
destroying
him
and
made
the
hope
of
death
wax
faint
and
dim
for
trembling
and
ashamed
from
out
the
street
strong
men
he
called
and
faint
with
jealousy
he
caused
them
bear
the
ponderous
moveless
feet
unto
the
chamber
where
he
used
to
lie
so
in
a
fair
niche
to
his
bed
anigh
unwitting
of
his
woe
they
set
it
down
then
went
their
ways
beneath
his
troubled
frown
then
to
his
treasury
he
went
and
sought
fair
gems
for
its
adornment
but
all
there
seemed
to
his
eager
eyes
but
poor
and
nought
not
worthy
to
touch
her
rippled
hair
so
he
departing
through
the
streets
fare
and
from
the
merchants
at
a
mighty
cost
bought
gems
that
kings
for
no
good
deed
had
lost
these
then
he
hung
her
senseless
neck
around
set
on
her
fingers
and
fair
arms
of
stone
then
cast
himself
before
her
on
the
ground
praying
for
grace
for
all
that
he
had
done
in
leaving
her
untended
and
alone
and
still
with
every
hour
his
madness
grew
though
all
his
folly
in
his
heart
he
knew
at
last
asleep
before
her
feet
he
lay
worn
out
with
passion
yet
this
burning
pain
returned
on
him
when
with
the
light
of
day
he
woke
and
wept
before
her
feet
again
then
of
the
fresh
and
morning
fain
into
his
garden
passed
and
therefrom
bore
new
spoil
of
flowers
his
love
to
lay
before
a
little
altar
with
fine
gold
was
in
his
house
that
he
a
while
ago
at
some
great
man
command
had
deftly
made
and
this
he
now
must
take
and
set
below
her
feet
and
there
must
red
flame
glow
about
sweet
wood
and
he
must
send
her
thence
the
odour
of
arabian
frankincense
then
as
the
smoke
went
up
he
prayed
and
said
thou
image
me
not
nor
wilt
thou
speak
but
i
perchance
shall
know
when
i
am
dead
if
this
has
been
some
goddess
sport
to
seek
a
wretch
and
in
his
heart
infirm
and
weak
to
set
her
glorious
image
so
that
he
loving
the
form
of
immortality
may
make
much
laughter
for
the
gods
above
hear
me
and
if
my
love
misliketh
thee
then
take
my
life
away
for
i
will
love
till
death
unfeared
at
last
shall
come
to
me
and
give
me
rest
if
he
of
might
may
be
to
slay
the
love
of
that
which
can
not
die
the
heavenly
beauty
that
can
pass
by
no
word
indeed
the
moveless
image
said
but
with
the
sweet
grave
eyes
his
hands
had
wrought
still
gazed
down
on
his
bowed
imploring
head
yet
his
own
words
some
solace
to
him
brought
gilding
the
net
wherein
his
soul
was
caught
with
something
like
to
hope
and
all
that
day
some
tender
words
he
ever
found
to
say
and
still
he
felt
as
something
heard
him
speak
sometimes
he
praised
her
beauty
and
sometimes
reproached
her
in
a
feeble
voice
and
weak
and
at
the
last
drew
forth
a
book
of
rhymes
wherein
were
writ
the
tales
of
many
climes
and
read
aloud
the
sweetness
hid
therein
of
lovers
sorrows
and
their
tangled
sin
and
when
the
sun
went
down
the
frankincense
again
upon
the
he
cast
that
through
the
open
window
floating
thence
the
fresh
odours
of
the
garden
passed
and
so
another
day
was
gone
at
last
and
he
no
more
his
watch
could
keep
but
now
for
utter
weariness
must
sleep
but
in
the
night
he
dreamed
that
she
was
gone
and
knowing
that
he
dreamed
tried
hard
to
wake
and
could
not
but
forsaken
and
alone
he
seemed
to
weep
as
though
his
heart
would
break
and
when
the
night
her
sleepy
veil
did
take
from
off
the
world
waking
his
tears
he
found
still
wet
upon
the
pillow
all
around
then
at
the
first
bewildered
by
those
tears
he
fell
wherefore
he
had
wept
but
suddenly
remembering
all
his
fears
panting
with
terror
from
the
bed
he
leapt
but
still
its
wonted
place
the
image
kept
nor
moved
for
all
the
joyful
ecstasy
wherewith
he
blessed
the
day
that
showed
it
nigh
then
came
the
morning
offering
and
the
day
midst
flowers
and
words
of
love
and
kisses
sweet
from
morn
through
noon
to
evening
passed
away
and
scarce
unhappy
crouching
at
her
feet
he
saw
the
sun
descend
the
sea
to
meet
and
scarce
unhappy
through
the
darkness
crept
unto
his
bed
and
midst
soft
dreaming
slept
but
the
next
morn
while
the
at
curled
round
about
her
head
sweet
sound
of
songs
the
wonted
quiet
broke
down
in
the
street
and
he
by
something
led
he
knew
not
what
must
leave
his
prayer
unsaid
and
through
the
freshness
of
the
morn
must
see
the
folk
who
went
with
that
sweet
minstrelsy
damsels
and
youths
in
wonderful
attire
and
in
their
midst
upon
a
car
of
gold
an
image
of
the
mother
of
desire
wrought
by
his
hands
in
days
that
seemed
grown
old
though
those
sweet
limbs
a
garment
did
enfold
coloured
like
flame
enwrought
with
precious
things
most
fit
to
be
the
prize
of
striving
kings
then
he
remembered
that
the
manner
was
that
priests
the
lovely
queen
should
take
thrice
in
the
year
and
through
the
city
pass
and
with
sweet
songs
the
dreaming
folk
awake
and
through
the
clouds
a
light
there
seemed
to
break
when
he
remembered
all
the
tales
well
told
about
her
glorious
kindly
deeds
of
old
so
his
unfinished
prayer
he
finished
not
but
kneeling
once
more
kissed
the
marble
feet
and
while
his
heart
with
many
thoughts
waxed
hot
he
clad
himself
with
fresh
attire
and
meet
for
that
bright
service
and
with
blossoms
sweet
entwined
with
tender
leaves
he
crowned
his
head
and
followed
after
as
the
goddess
led
but
long
and
vain
unto
him
seemed
the
way
until
they
came
unto
her
house
again
long
years
the
while
they
went
about
to
lay
the
dwellers
on
the
plain
the
sweet
companions
of
the
yellowing
grain
upon
her
golden
altar
long
and
long
before
at
end
of
their
delicious
song
they
stripped
her
of
her
weed
with
reverend
hands
and
showed
the
ivory
limbs
his
hand
had
wrought
yea
and
too
long
then
ere
those
fair
bands
dispersing
here
and
there
the
shadow
sought
of
indian
the
warm
sea
brought
and
toward
the
splashing
of
the
fountain
turned
mocked
the
noon
sun
that
the
cloisters
burned
but
when
the
crowd
of
worshippers
was
gone
and
through
the
golden
dimness
of
the
place
the
goddess
very
servants
paced
alone
or
some
lone
damsel
murmured
of
her
case
apart
from
prying
eyes
he
turned
his
face
unto
that
image
made
with
toil
and
care
in
days
when
unto
him
it
seemed
most
fair
dusky
and
dim
though
rich
with
gems
and
gold
the
house
of
venus
was
high
in
the
dome
the
burning
you
could
now
behold
from
nowhere
else
the
light
of
day
might
come
to
shame
the
mother
lovely
home
a
long
way
off
the
shrine
the
fresh
now
just
arising
brushed
the
the
torches
of
the
singing
band
erewhile
indeed
made
more
than
daylight
there
lighting
the
painted
tales
of
many
a
land
and
carven
heroes
with
their
unused
glare
but
now
a
few
soft
glimmering
lamps
there
were
and
on
the
altar
a
thin
flickering
flame
just
showed
the
golden
letters
of
her
name
blue
in
the
dome
yet
hung
the
and
still
its
perfume
lingered
all
around
and
trodden
by
the
fervent
crowd
thick
lay
the
summer
flowers
upon
the
ground
and
now
from
halls
uprose
the
sound
of
lydian
music
and
the
dancer
cry
as
though
some
door
were
opened
suddenly
so
there
he
stood
some
help
from
her
to
gain
bewildered
by
that
twilight
midst
of
day
downcast
with
listening
to
the
joyous
strain
he
had
no
part
in
hopeless
with
delay
of
all
the
fair
things
he
had
meant
to
say
yet
as
the
incense
on
the
flame
he
cast
from
stammering
lips
and
pale
these
words
there
passed
o
thou
forgotten
help
dost
thou
yet
know
what
thing
it
is
i
need
when
even
i
bent
down
before
thee
in
this
shame
and
woe
can
frame
no
set
of
words
to
tell
thee
why
i
needs
must
pray
o
help
me
or
i
die
or
slay
me
and
in
slaying
take
from
me
even
a
dead
man
feeble
memory
say
not
thine
help
i
have
been
slow
to
seek
here
have
i
been
from
the
first
hour
of
morn
who
stand
before
thy
presence
faint
and
weak
of
my
one
poor
delight
left
all
forlorn
trembling
with
many
fears
the
hope
outworn
i
had
when
first
i
left
my
love
my
shame
to
call
upon
thine
glorious
name
he
stopped
to
catch
his
breath
for
as
a
sob
did
each
word
leave
his
mouth
but
suddenly
like
a
live
thing
the
thin
flame
to
throb
and
gather
force
and
then
shot
up
on
high
a
steady
spike
of
light
that
drew
anigh
the
sunbeam
in
the
dome
then
sank
once
more
into
a
feeble
flicker
as
before
but
at
that
sight
the
nameless
hope
he
had
that
kept
him
living
midst
unhappiness
stirred
in
his
breast
and
with
changed
face
and
glad
unto
the
image
forward
must
he
press
with
words
of
praise
his
first
word
to
redress
but
then
it
was
as
though
a
thick
black
cloud
altar
and
fire
and
ivory
limbs
did
shroud
he
staggered
back
amazed
and
full
of
awe
but
when
with
anxious
eyes
he
gazed
around
about
him
still
the
worshippers
he
saw
sunk
in
their
wonted
works
with
no
surprise
at
what
to
him
seemed
awful
mysteries
therewith
he
sighed
and
said
this
too
i
dream
no
better
day
upon
my
life
shall
beam
and
yet
for
long
upon
the
place
he
gazed
where
other
folk
beheld
the
lovely
queen
and
while
he
looked
the
dusky
veil
seemed
raised
and
every
thing
was
as
it
erst
had
been
and
then
he
said
such
marvels
i
have
seen
as
some
sick
man
may
see
from
off
his
bed
ah
i
am
sick
and
would
that
i
were
dead
therewith
not
questioning
his
heart
at
all
he
turned
away
and
left
the
holy
place
when
now
the
wide
sun
reddened
towards
his
fall
and
a
fresh
west
wind
held
the
clouds
in
chase
but
coming
out
at
first
he
hid
his
face
dazed
with
the
light
and
in
the
porch
he
stood
nor
wished
to
move
or
change
his
dreary
mood
yet
in
a
while
the
freshness
of
the
eve
pierced
to
his
weary
heart
and
with
a
sigh
he
raised
his
head
and
slowly
to
leave
the
high
carved
pillars
and
so
presently
had
passed
the
grove
of
whispering
myrtles
by
and
mid
the
many
noises
of
the
street
made
himself
brave
the
eyes
of
men
to
meet
thronged
were
the
ways
with
folk
in
gay
attire
nursing
the
end
of
that
festivity
girls
fit
to
move
the
moody
man
desire
brushed
past
him
and
soft
dainty
minstrelsy
he
heard
amid
the
laughter
and
might
see
through
open
doors
the
garden
green
delight
where
pensive
lovers
waited
for
the
night
or
resting
dancers
round
the
fountain
drawn
with
faces
flushed
unto
the
breeze
turned
round
or
wandering
the
fragrant
trodden
lawn
took
up
their
fallen
garlands
from
the
ground
or
languidly
their
scattered
tresses
bound
or
let
their
gathered
raiment
fall
adown
with
eyes
downcast
beneath
their
lovers
frown
what
hope
pygmalion
yet
might
have
when
he
first
left
the
pillars
of
the
dreamy
place
amid
such
sights
had
vanished
utterly
he
turned
his
weary
eyes
from
face
to
face
nor
noted
them
as
at
a
lagging
pace
he
gat
towards
home
and
still
was
murmuring
ah
life
sweet
life
the
only
godlike
thing
and
as
he
went
though
longing
to
be
there
whereas
his
sole
desire
awaited
him
yet
did
he
loath
to
see
the
image
fair
white
and
unchanged
of
face
unmoved
of
limb
and
to
his
heart
came
dreamy
thoughts
and
dim
that
unto
some
strange
region
he
might
come
nor
ever
reach
again
his
loveless
home
yet
soon
indeed
before
his
door
he
stood
and
as
a
man
awaking
from
a
dream
seemed
waked
from
his
old
folly
nought
seemed
good
in
all
the
things
that
he
before
had
deemed
at
least
worth
life
and
on
his
heart
there
streamed
cold
light
of
day
he
found
himself
alone
reft
of
desire
all
love
and
madness
gone
and
yet
for
that
past
folly
must
he
weep
as
one
might
mourn
the
parted
happiness
that
mixed
with
madness
made
him
smile
in
sleep
and
still
some
lingering
sweetness
seemed
to
bless
the
hard
life
left
of
toil
and
loneliness
like
a
past
song
too
sweet
too
short
and
yet
emmeshed
for
ever
in
the
memory
net
weeping
he
entered
murmuring
o
fair
queen
i
thank
thee
that
my
prayer
was
not
for
nought
truly
a
present
helper
hast
thou
been
to
those
who
faithfully
thy
throne
have
sought
yet
since
with
pain
deliverance
i
have
bought
hast
thou
not
yet
some
gift
in
store
for
me
that
i
thine
happy
slave
henceforth
may
be
thus
to
his
chamber
at
the
last
he
came
and
pushing
through
the
still
door
he
stood
within
but
there
for
very
shame
of
all
the
things
that
he
had
done
before
still
kept
his
eyes
bent
down
upon
the
floor
thinking
of
all
that
he
had
done
and
said
since
he
had
wrought
that
luckless
marble
maid
yet
soft
his
thoughts
were
and
the
very
place
seemed
perfumed
with
some
nameless
heavenly
air
so
gaining
courage
did
he
raise
his
face
unto
the
work
his
hands
had
made
so
fair
and
cried
aloud
to
see
the
niche
all
bare
of
that
sweet
form
while
through
his
heart
again
there
shot
a
pang
of
his
old
yearning
pain
yet
while
he
stood
and
knew
not
what
to
do
with
yearning
a
strange
thrill
of
hope
there
came
a
shaft
of
new
desire
now
pierced
him
through
and
therewithal
a
soft
voice
called
his
name
and
when
he
turned
with
eager
eyes
aflame
he
saw
betwixt
him
and
the
setting
sun
the
lively
image
of
his
lovéd
one
he
trembled
at
the
sight
for
though
her
eyes
her
very
lips
were
such
as
he
had
made
and
though
her
tresses
fell
but
in
such
guise
as
he
had
wrought
them
now
was
she
arrayed
in
that
fair
garment
that
the
priests
had
laid
upon
the
goddess
on
that
very
morn
dyed
like
the
setting
sun
upon
the
corn
speechless
he
stood
but
she
now
drew
anear
simple
and
sweet
as
she
was
wont
to
be
and
all
at
once
her
silver
voice
rang
clear
filling
his
soul
with
great
felicity
and
thus
she
spoke
pygmalion
come
to
me
o
dear
companion
of
my
life
for
i
am
called
thy
lover
and
thy
wife
listen
these
words
the
dread
one
bade
me
say
that
was
with
me
now
soul
i
give
to
thee
feel
the
sweet
breath
that
thy
prayer
has
won
lay
thine
hand
this
heaving
breast
upon
love
and
walk
with
me
between
the
trees
feel
the
freshness
of
the
evening
sweep
mine
hair
round
thy
neck
behold
my
feet
feet
thou
thoughtst
should
never
move
down
the
daisies
draw
me
to
thee
sweet
feel
the
warm
heart
of
thy
living
against
thine
and
bless
the
seed
of
loving
tender
heart
hath
wrought
all
this
wrapped
us
both
in
such
a
cloud
of
ah
thou
art
wise
to
know
what
this
may
mean
sweet
seem
the
words
to
me
and
needs
must
i
speak
all
the
lesson
of
the
lovely
queen
but
this
i
know
i
would
we
were
more
nigh
i
have
not
heard
thy
voice
but
in
the
cry
thou
utteredst
then
when
thou
believedst
gone
the
marvel
of
thine
hands
the
maid
of
stone
she
reached
her
hand
to
him
and
with
kind
eyes
gazed
into
his
but
he
the
fingers
caught
and
drew
her
to
him
and
midst
ecstasies
passing
all
words
yea
passing
thought
felt
that
sweet
breath
that
he
so
long
had
sought
felt
the
warm
life
within
her
heaving
breast
as
in
his
arms
his
living
love
he
pressed
but
as
his
cheek
touched
hers
he
heard
her
say
wilt
thou
not
speak
o
love
why
dost
thou
weep
art
thou
then
sorry
for
this
day
or
dost
thou
think
perchance
thou
wilt
not
keep
this
that
thou
holdest
but
in
dreamy
sleep
nay
let
us
do
the
bidding
of
the
queen
and
hand
in
hand
walk
through
thy
garden
green
then
shalt
thou
tell
me
still
beholding
me
full
many
things
whereof
i
wish
to
know
and
as
we
walk
from
whispering
tree
to
tree
still
more
familiar
to
thee
shall
i
grow
and
such
things
shalt
thou
say
unto
me
now
as
when
thou
deemedst
thou
wast
quite
alone
a
madman
kneeling
to
a
thing
of
stone
but
at
that
word
a
smile
lit
up
his
eyes
and
therewithal
he
spake
some
loving
word
and
she
at
first
looked
up
in
grave
surprise
when
his
deep
voice
and
musical
she
heard
and
clung
to
him
as
grown
somewhat
afeard
then
cried
aloud
and
said
o
mighty
one
what
joy
with
thee
to
look
upon
the
sun
then
into
that
fair
garden
did
they
pass
and
all
the
story
of
his
love
he
told
and
as
the
twain
went
the
dewy
grass
beneath
the
risen
moon
could
he
behold
the
bright
tears
trickling
down
then
waxen
bold
he
stopped
and
said
ah
love
what
meaneth
this
seest
thou
how
tears
still
follow
earthly
bliss
then
both
her
white
arms
round
his
neck
she
threw
and
sobbing
said
o
love
what
hurteth
me
when
first
the
sweetness
of
my
life
i
knew
not
this
i
felt
but
when
i
first
saw
thee
a
little
pain
and
great
felicity
rose
up
within
me
and
thy
talk
now
made
pain
and
pleasure
ever
greater
grow
o
sweet
he
said
this
thing
is
even
love
whereof
i
told
thee
that
all
wise
men
fear
but
yet
escape
not
nay
to
gods
above
unless
the
old
tales
lie
it
draweth
near
but
let
my
happy
ears
i
pray
thee
hear
thy
story
too
and
how
thy
blessed
birth
has
made
a
heaven
of
this
once
lonely
earth
my
sweet
she
said
as
yet
i
am
not
wise
or
stored
with
words
aright
the
tale
to
tell
but
listen
when
i
opened
first
mine
eyes
i
stood
within
the
niche
thou
knowest
well
and
from
mine
hand
a
heavy
thing
there
fell
carved
like
these
flowers
nor
could
i
see
things
clear
and
but
a
strange
confusèd
noise
could
hear
at
last
mine
eyes
could
see
a
woman
fair
but
awful
as
this
round
white
moon
so
that
i
trembled
when
i
saw
her
there
for
with
my
life
was
born
some
touch
of
dread
and
therewithal
i
heard
her
voice
that
said
down
and
learn
to
love
and
be
alive
for
thee
a
gift
i
give
then
on
the
floor
i
stepped
rejoicing
much
not
knowing
why
not
knowing
aught
at
all
till
she
reached
out
her
hand
my
breast
to
touch
and
when
her
fingers
thereupon
did
fall
thought
came
unto
my
life
and
therewithal
i
knew
her
for
a
goddess
and
began
to
murmur
in
some
tongue
unknown
to
man
and
then
indeed
not
in
this
guise
was
i
no
sandals
had
i
and
no
saffron
gown
but
naked
as
thou
knowest
utterly
as
my
limbs
beneath
thine
hand
had
grown
and
this
fair
perfumed
robe
then
fell
adown
over
the
goddess
feet
and
swept
the
ground
and
round
her
loins
a
glittering
belt
was
bound
but
when
the
stammering
of
my
tongue
she
heard
upon
my
trembling
lips
her
hand
she
laid
and
spoke
again
say
not
any
word
all
that
thine
heart
would
say
i
know
unsaid
who
even
now
thine
heart
and
voice
have
made
but
listen
rather
for
thou
knowest
now
what
these
words
mean
and
still
wilt
wiser
grow
body
lifeless
till
i
gave
it
life
a
certain
man
my
servant
well
hath
wrought
i
give
thee
to
him
as
his
love
and
wife
with
all
thy
dowry
of
desire
and
thought
since
this
his
yearning
heart
hath
ever
sought
now
from
my
temple
is
he
on
the
way
deeming
to
find
thee
as
yesterday
thou
his
coming
by
the
there
and
when
thou
seest
him
set
his
eyes
upon
thine
empty
niche
and
him
cry
for
care
then
call
him
by
his
name
pygmalion
and
certainly
thy
lover
hast
thou
won
but
when
he
stands
before
thee
silently
say
all
these
words
that
i
shall
teach
to
thee
with
that
she
said
what
first
i
told
thee
love
and
then
went
on
thou
shalt
say
that
i
the
daughter
of
almighty
jove
have
wrought
for
him
this
day
in
sign
whereof
these
things
that
pass
away
wherein
mine
image
men
have
well
arrayed
i
give
thee
for
thy
wedding
gear
o
maid
therewith
her
raiment
she
put
off
from
her
and
laid
bare
all
her
perfect
loveliness
and
smiling
on
me
came
yet
more
anear
and
on
my
mortal
lips
her
lips
did
press
and
said
herewith
shalt
thou
love
no
less
than
psyche
loved
my
son
in
days
of
old
farewell
of
thee
shall
many
a
tale
be
told
and
even
with
that
last
word
was
she
gone
how
i
know
not
and
i
my
limbs
arrayed
in
her
fair
gift
and
waited
thee
alone
ah
love
indeed
the
word
is
true
she
said
for
now
i
love
thee
so
i
grow
afraid
of
what
the
gods
upon
our
heads
may
send
i
love
thee
so
i
think
upon
the
end
what
words
he
said
how
can
i
tell
again
what
words
they
said
beneath
the
glimmering
light
some
tongue
they
used
unknown
to
loveless
men
as
each
to
each
they
told
their
great
delight
until
for
stillness
of
the
growing
night
their
soft
sweet
murmuring
words
seemed
growing
loud
and
dim
the
moon
grew
hid
by
fleecy
cloud
such
was
the
ending
of
his
ancient
rhyme
that
seemed
to
fit
that
soft
and
golden
time
when
men
were
happy
they
could
scarce
tell
why
although
they
felt
the
rich
year
slipping
by
the
sun
went
down
the
arose
and
the
slim
trees
of
that
fruitful
close
they
saw
the
corn
still
falling
its
light
while
through
the
soft
air
of
the
windless
night
the
voices
of
the
reapers
mates
rang
clear
in
measured
song
as
of
the
fruitful
year
they
told
and
its
delights
and
now
and
then
the
rougher
voices
of
the
toiling
men
joined
in
the
song
as
one
by
one
released
from
that
hard
toil
they
sauntered
towards
the
feast
that
waited
them
upon
the
strip
of
grass
that
through
the
sea
did
pass
but
those
old
men
glad
to
have
lived
so
long
sat
listening
through
the
twilight
to
the
song
and
when
the
night
grew
and
all
things
were
still
throughout
the
wide
vale
from
green
hill
to
hill
unto
a
happy
harvesting
they
drank
till
once
more
the
hills
the
white
moon
sank
august
had
not
gone
by
though
now
was
stored
in
the
granaries
all
the
hoard
of
golden
corn
the
land
had
made
her
gain
and
winter
should
howl
round
her
doors
in
vain
but
the
same
fields
grey
now
and
forlorn
the
old
men
sat
and
heard
the
swineherd
horn
far
off
across
the
stubble
when
the
day
at
end
of
was
sad
and
grey
and
rain
was
in
the
wind
voice
as
it
swept
along
the
hedges
where
the
lone
quail
crept
beneath
the
chattering
of
the
restless
pie
the
branches
moved
and
suddenly
the
trembling
apples
smote
the
dewless
grass
and
all
the
year
to
did
pass
such
a
day
it
was
as
young
men
love
when
swiftly
through
the
veins
the
blood
doth
move
and
they
whose
eyes
can
see
not
death
at
all
to
thoughts
of
stirring
deeds
and
pleasure
fall
because
it
seems
to
them
to
tell
of
life
after
the
dreamy
days
devoid
of
strife
when
every
day
with
sunshine
is
begun
and
cloudless
skies
receive
the
setting
sun
on
such
a
day
the
older
folk
were
fain
of
something
new
somewhat
to
dull
the
pain
of
sad
importunate
old
memories
that
to
their
weary
hearts
must
needs
arise
alas
what
new
things
on
that
day
could
come
from
hearts
that
now
so
long
had
been
the
home
of
such
dull
thoughts
nay
rather
let
them
tell
some
tale
that
fits
their
ancient
longings
well
rolf
was
the
speaker
who
said
friends
behold
this
is
such
a
tale
as
those
once
told
unto
my
greedy
ears
by
nicholas
before
our
quest
for
nothing
came
to
pass
ogier
the
dane
argument
when
ogier
was
born
six
fay
ladies
came
to
the
cradle
where
he
lay
and
gave
him
various
gifts
as
to
be
brave
and
happy
and
the
like
but
the
sixth
gave
him
to
be
her
love
when
he
should
have
lived
long
in
the
world
so
ogier
grew
up
and
became
the
greatest
of
knights
and
at
last
after
many
years
fell
into
the
hands
of
that
fay
and
with
her
as
the
story
tells
he
lives
now
though
he
returned
once
to
the
world
as
is
shown
in
the
process
of
this
tale
within
some
danish
city
by
the
sea
whose
name
changed
now
is
all
unknown
to
me
great
mourning
was
there
one
fair
summer
eve
because
the
angels
bidden
to
receive
the
fair
queen
lovely
soul
in
paradise
had
done
their
bidding
and
in
royal
guise
her
helpless
body
once
the
prize
of
love
unable
now
for
fear
or
hope
to
move
lay
underneath
the
golden
canopy
and
bowed
down
by
unkingly
misery
the
king
sat
by
it
and
not
far
away
within
the
chamber
a
fair
lay
his
mother
bane
the
king
that
was
to
be
not
witting
yet
of
any
royalty
harmless
and
loved
although
so
new
to
life
calm
the
june
evening
was
no
sign
of
strife
the
clear
sky
showed
no
storm
grew
round
the
sun
unhappy
that
his
day
of
bliss
was
done
dumb
was
the
sea
and
if
the
stirred
was
with
the
nestling
of
the
bird
midst
its
thick
leaves
and
though
the
nightingale
her
ancient
hapless
sorrow
must
bewail
no
more
of
woe
there
seemed
within
her
song
than
such
as
doth
to
lovers
words
belong
because
their
love
is
still
unsatisfied
but
to
the
king
on
that
sweet
eventide
no
earth
there
seemed
no
heaven
when
earth
was
gone
no
help
no
god
but
lonely
pain
alone
and
he
midst
unreal
shadows
seemed
to
sit
himself
the
very
heart
and
soul
of
it
but
round
the
cradle
of
the
child
the
nurses
now
the
weary
time
beguiled
with
stories
of
the
just
departed
queen
and
how
amid
the
heathen
folk
first
seen
she
had
been
won
to
love
and
godliness
and
as
they
spoke
midst
his
dull
distress
an
eager
whisper
now
and
then
did
smite
upon
the
king
ear
of
some
past
delight
some
once
familiar
name
and
he
would
raise
his
weary
head
and
on
the
speaker
gaze
like
one
about
to
speak
but
soon
again
would
drop
his
head
and
be
alone
with
pain
nor
think
of
these
who
silent
in
their
turn
would
sit
and
watch
the
waxen
tapers
burn
amidst
the
dusk
of
the
night
until
beneath
the
high
stars
glimmering
light
the
fresh
earth
lay
in
colourless
repose
so
passed
the
night
and
now
and
then
one
rose
from
out
her
place
to
do
what
might
avail
to
still
the
infant
fretful
wail
or
through
the
door
there
came
some
nurse
new
waked
who
whispering
low
the
name
of
her
whose
turn
was
come
would
take
her
place
then
toward
the
king
would
turn
about
her
face
and
to
her
fellows
whisper
of
the
day
and
tell
again
of
her
just
past
away
so
waned
the
hours
the
moon
arose
and
grew
from
off
the
sea
a
little
blew
rustling
the
like
sudden
rain
and
ere
the
moon
began
to
fall
again
the
wind
grew
cold
a
change
was
in
the
sky
and
in
deep
silence
did
the
dawn
draw
nigh
then
from
her
place
a
nurse
arose
to
light
fresh
hallowed
lights
for
dying
with
the
night
the
tapers
round
about
the
dead
queen
were
but
the
king
raised
his
head
and
to
stare
upon
her
as
her
sweeping
gown
did
glide
about
the
floor
that
in
the
stillness
cried
beneath
her
careful
feet
and
now
as
she
had
lit
the
second
candle
carefully
and
on
its
silver
spike
another
one
was
setting
through
her
body
did
there
run
a
sudden
tremor
and
the
hand
was
stayed
that
on
the
dainty
painted
wax
was
laid
her
eyelids
fell
down
and
she
seemed
to
sleep
and
the
staring
king
began
to
creep
sweet
slumber
too
the
bitter
lines
of
woe
that
drew
his
weary
face
did
softer
grow
his
eyelids
dropped
his
arms
fell
to
his
side
and
moveless
in
their
places
did
abide
the
nursing
women
held
by
some
strong
spell
as
they
were
and
utter
silence
fell
upon
the
mournful
glimmering
chamber
fair
but
now
light
footsteps
coming
up
the
stair
smote
on
the
deadly
stillness
and
the
sound
of
silken
dresses
trailing
the
ground
and
heavenly
odours
through
the
chamber
passed
unlike
the
scents
that
rose
and
lily
cast
upon
the
freshness
of
the
dying
night
then
nigher
drew
the
sound
of
footsteps
light
until
the
door
swung
open
noiselessly
a
mass
of
sunlit
flowers
there
seemed
to
be
within
the
doorway
and
but
pale
and
wan
the
flame
showed
now
that
serveth
mortal
man
as
one
by
one
six
seeming
ladies
passed
into
the
room
and
its
sorrow
cast
that
thoughtless
sense
of
joy
bewildering
that
kisses
youthful
hearts
amidst
of
spring
crowned
were
they
in
such
glorious
raiment
clad
as
yet
no
merchant
of
the
world
has
had
within
his
coffers
yet
those
crowns
seemed
fair
only
because
they
kissed
their
odorous
hair
and
all
that
flowery
raiment
was
but
blessed
by
those
fair
bodies
that
its
splendour
pressed
now
to
the
cradle
from
that
glorious
band
a
woman
passed
and
laid
a
tender
hand
upon
the
babe
and
gently
drew
aside
the
swathings
soft
that
did
his
body
hide
and
seeing
him
so
fair
and
great
she
smiled
and
stooped
and
kissed
him
saying
o
noble
child
have
thou
a
gift
from
gloriande
this
day
for
to
the
time
when
life
shall
pass
away
from
this
dear
heart
no
fear
of
death
or
shame
no
weariness
of
good
shall
foul
thy
name
so
saying
to
her
sisters
she
returned
and
one
came
forth
upon
whose
brow
there
burned
a
crown
of
rubies
and
whose
heaving
breast
with
happy
rings
a
golden
hauberk
pressed
she
took
the
babe
and
somewhat
frowning
said
this
gift
i
give
that
till
thy
limbs
are
laid
at
rest
for
ever
to
thine
honoured
life
there
never
shall
be
lacking
war
and
strife
that
thou
a
name
mayst
win
and
by
thy
deeds
good
pardon
for
thy
sin
with
that
another
who
unseen
meanwhile
had
drawn
anigh
said
with
a
joyous
smile
and
this
forgotten
gift
to
thee
i
give
that
while
amidst
the
turmoil
thou
dost
live
still
shalt
thou
win
the
game
and
unto
thee
defeat
and
shame
but
idle
words
shall
be
then
back
they
turned
and
therewithal
the
fourth
said
take
this
gift
for
what
it
may
be
worth
for
that
is
mine
to
give
lo
thou
shalt
be
gentle
of
speech
and
in
all
courtesy
the
first
of
men
a
little
gift
this
is
after
these
promises
of
fame
and
bliss
then
toward
the
babe
the
fifth
fair
woman
went
she
was
and
simple
with
eyes
bent
down
on
the
floor
parted
her
red
lips
were
and
her
sweet
face
marvellously
fair
oft
would
the
colour
spread
full
suddenly
clad
in
a
dainty
gown
and
thin
was
she
for
some
green
summer
of
the
dight
tripping
she
went
and
laid
her
fingers
light
upon
the
child
and
said
o
little
one
as
long
as
thou
shalt
look
upon
the
sun
shall
women
long
for
thee
take
heed
to
this
and
give
them
what
thou
canst
of
love
and
bliss
then
blushing
for
her
words
therefrom
she
past
and
by
the
cradle
stood
the
sixth
and
last
the
fairest
of
them
all
awhile
she
gazed
down
on
the
child
and
then
her
hand
she
raised
and
made
the
one
side
of
her
bosom
bare
ogier
she
said
if
this
be
foul
or
fair
thou
not
now
but
when
thine
earthly
life
is
drunk
out
to
the
dregs
and
war
and
strife
have
yielded
thee
whatever
joy
they
may
thine
head
upon
this
bosom
shalt
thou
lay
and
then
despite
of
knowledge
or
of
god
will
we
be
glad
upon
the
flowery
sod
within
the
happy
country
where
i
dwell
ogier
my
love
that
is
to
be
farewell
she
turned
and
even
as
they
came
they
passed
from
out
the
place
and
reached
the
gate
at
last
that
oped
before
their
feet
and
speedily
they
gained
the
edges
of
the
murmuring
sea
and
as
they
stood
in
silence
gazing
there
out
to
the
west
they
vanished
into
air
i
know
not
how
nor
whereto
they
returned
but
mixed
with
twilight
in
the
chamber
burned
the
flickering
candles
and
those
dreary
folk
unlike
to
sleepers
from
their
trance
awoke
but
nought
of
what
had
happed
meanwhile
they
knew
through
the
casements
now
there
blew
a
sweet
fresh
air
that
of
the
flowers
and
sea
mingled
together
smelt
deliciously
and
from
the
unseen
sun
the
spreading
light
began
to
make
the
fair
june
blossoms
bright
and
midst
their
weary
woe
uprose
the
sun
and
thus
has
ogier
noble
life
begun
hope
is
our
life
when
first
our
life
grows
clear
hope
and
delight
scarce
crossed
by
lines
of
fear
yet
the
day
comes
when
fain
we
would
not
hope
but
forasmuch
as
we
with
life
must
cope
struggling
with
this
and
that
who
knoweth
why
hope
will
not
give
us
up
to
certainty
but
still
must
bide
with
us
and
with
this
man
whose
life
amid
such
promises
began
great
things
she
wrought
but
now
the
time
has
come
when
he
no
more
on
earth
may
have
his
home
great
things
he
suffered
great
delights
he
had
unto
great
kings
he
gave
good
deeds
for
bad
he
ruled
kingdoms
where
his
name
no
more
is
had
in
memory
and
on
many
a
shore
he
left
his
sweat
and
blood
to
win
a
name
passing
the
bounds
of
earthly
creatures
fame
a
love
he
won
and
lost
a
son
whose
little
day
of
promise
soon
was
done
a
tender
wife
he
had
that
he
must
leave
before
his
heart
her
love
could
well
receive
those
promised
gifts
that
on
his
careless
head
in
those
first
hours
of
his
fair
life
were
shed
he
took
unwitting
and
unwitting
spent
nor
gave
himself
to
grief
and
discontent
because
he
saw
the
end
nigh
where
is
he
now
in
what
land
must
he
die
to
leave
an
empty
name
to
us
on
earth
a
tale
half
true
to
cast
across
our
mirth
some
pensive
thoughts
of
life
that
might
have
been
where
is
he
now
that
all
this
life
has
seen
behold
another
eve
upon
the
earth
than
that
calm
evening
of
the
warrior
birth
the
sun
is
setting
in
the
west
the
sky
is
bright
and
clear
and
hard
and
no
clouds
lie
about
the
golden
circle
of
the
sun
but
east
aloof
from
him
heavy
and
dun
they
pack
with
edges
red
as
blood
and
underneath
them
is
the
weltering
flood
of
some
huge
sea
whose
tumbling
hills
as
they
turn
restless
sides
about
are
black
or
grey
or
green
or
glittering
with
the
golden
flame
the
wind
has
fallen
now
but
still
the
same
the
mighty
army
moves
as
if
to
drown
this
lone
bare
rock
whose
shear
scarped
sides
of
brown
cast
off
the
weight
of
waves
in
clouds
of
spray
alas
what
ships
upon
an
evil
day
bent
over
to
the
wind
in
this
ill
sea
what
navy
whose
rent
bones
lie
wretchedly
beneath
these
cliffs
a
mighty
one
it
was
a
fearful
storm
to
bring
such
things
to
pass
this
is
the
loadstone
rock
no
armament
of
warring
nations
in
their
madness
bent
their
course
this
way
no
merchant
wittingly
has
steered
his
keel
unto
this
luckless
sea
upon
no
shipman
card
its
name
is
writ
though
mariners
will
speak
of
it
within
the
ingle
on
the
winter
night
when
all
within
is
warm
and
safe
and
bright
and
the
wind
howls
without
but
their
will
are
some
folk
driven
here
and
then
all
skill
against
this
evil
rock
is
vain
and
nought
and
unto
death
the
shipmen
soon
are
brought
for
then
the
keel
as
by
a
giant
hand
is
drawn
unto
that
mockery
of
a
land
and
presently
unto
its
sides
doth
cleave
when
if
they
swift
death
yet
none
may
leave
the
narrow
limits
of
that
barren
isle
and
thus
are
slain
by
famine
in
a
while
mocked
as
they
say
by
night
with
images
of
noble
castles
among
groves
of
trees
by
day
with
sounds
of
merry
minstrelsy
the
sun
sinks
now
below
this
hopeless
sea
the
clouds
are
gone
and
all
the
sky
is
bright
the
moon
is
rising
the
growing
night
and
by
its
shine
may
ye
behold
the
bones
of
generations
of
these
luckless
ones
scattered
about
the
rock
but
nigh
the
sea
sits
one
alive
who
uncomplainingly
awaits
his
death
is
he
and
old
arrayed
in
royal
raiment
bright
with
gold
but
tarnished
with
the
waves
and
rough
salt
air
huge
is
he
of
a
noble
face
and
fair
as
for
an
ancient
man
though
toil
and
eld
furrow
the
cheeks
that
ladies
once
beheld
with
melting
hearts
nay
listen
for
he
speaks
god
thou
hast
made
me
strong
nigh
seven
weeks
have
passed
since
from
the
wreck
we
haled
our
store
and
five
long
days
well
told
have
now
passed
since
my
last
fellow
died
with
my
last
bread
between
his
teeth
and
yet
i
am
not
dead
yea
but
for
this
i
had
been
strong
enow
in
some
last
bloody
field
my
sword
to
show
what
matter
soon
will
all
be
past
and
done
i
died
i
must
have
died
alone
yet
caraheu
a
good
death
had
it
been
dying
thy
face
above
me
to
have
seen
and
heard
my
banner
flapping
in
the
wind
then
though
my
memory
had
not
left
thy
mind
yet
hope
and
fear
would
not
have
vexed
thee
more
when
thou
hadst
known
that
everything
was
but
now
thou
waitest
still
expecting
me
whose
sail
shall
never
speck
thy
bright
blue
sea
and
thou
clarice
the
merchants
thou
mayst
call
to
tell
thee
tales
within
thy
pictured
hall
but
never
shall
they
tell
true
tales
of
me
whatever
sails
the
kentish
hills
may
see
swept
by
the
toward
thy
town
no
more
on
my
sails
shall
they
look
adown
get
thee
another
leader
charlemaine
for
thou
shalt
look
to
see
my
shield
in
vain
when
in
the
fair
fields
of
the
frankish
land
thick
as
the
corn
they
tread
the
heathen
stand
what
matter
ye
shall
learn
to
live
your
lives
husbands
and
children
other
friends
and
wives
shall
wipe
the
tablets
of
your
memory
clean
and
all
shall
be
as
i
had
never
been
and
now
o
god
am
i
alone
with
thee
a
little
thing
indeed
it
seems
to
be
to
give
this
life
up
since
it
needs
must
go
some
time
or
other
now
at
last
i
know
how
foolishly
men
play
upon
the
earth
when
unto
them
a
year
of
life
seems
worth
honour
and
friends
and
these
vague
hopes
and
sweet
that
like
real
things
my
dying
heart
do
greet
unreal
while
living
on
the
earth
i
trod
and
but
myself
i
knew
no
other
god
behold
i
thank
thee
that
thou
thus
this
end
that
i
had
thought
most
piteous
if
of
another
i
had
heard
it
told
what
man
is
this
who
weak
and
worn
and
old
gives
up
his
life
within
that
dreadful
isle
and
on
the
fearful
coming
death
can
smile
alas
this
man
so
battered
and
outworn
is
none
but
he
who
on
that
summer
morn
received
such
promises
of
glorious
life
ogier
the
dane
this
is
to
whom
all
strife
was
but
as
wine
to
stir
awhile
the
blood
to
whom
all
life
however
hard
was
good
this
is
the
man
unmatched
of
heart
and
limb
ogier
the
dane
whose
sight
has
waxed
not
dim
for
all
the
years
that
he
on
earth
has
dwelt
ogier
the
dane
that
never
fear
has
felt
since
he
knew
good
from
ill
ogier
the
dane
the
heathen
dread
the
bane
bright
had
the
moon
grown
as
his
words
were
done
and
no
more
was
there
memory
of
the
sun
within
the
west
and
he
grew
drowsy
now
and
somewhat
smoother
was
his
wrinkled
brow
as
thought
died
out
beneath
the
hand
of
sleep
and
his
soul
forgetfulness
did
creep
hiding
the
image
of
death
until
as
peacefully
he
drew
his
breath
as
on
that
day
past
for
a
hundred
years
when
midst
the
nurse
tears
he
fell
asleep
to
his
first
lullaby
the
night
changed
as
he
slept
white
clouds
and
high
began
about
the
lonely
moon
to
close
and
from
the
dark
west
a
new
wind
arose
and
with
the
sound
of
waves
mingled
its
pipe
about
the
loadstone
caves
but
when
the
twinkling
stars
were
hid
away
and
a
faint
light
and
broad
like
dawn
of
day
the
moon
upon
that
dreary
country
shed
ogier
awoke
and
lifting
up
his
head
and
smiling
muttered
nay
no
more
again
rather
some
pleasure
new
some
other
pain
unthought
of
both
some
other
form
of
strife
for
he
had
waked
from
dreams
of
his
old
life
and
through
omer
gate
once
more
had
seemed
to
pass
and
saw
the
state
of
that
triumphant
king
and
still
though
all
seemed
changed
and
folk
by
other
names
did
call
faces
he
knew
of
old
yet
none
the
less
he
seemed
the
same
and
midst
that
mightiness
felt
his
own
power
and
grew
the
more
athirst
for
coming
glory
as
of
old
when
first
he
stood
before
the
face
of
charlemaine
a
helpless
hostage
with
all
life
to
gain
but
now
awake
his
worn
face
once
more
sank
between
his
hands
and
murmuring
not
he
drank
the
draught
of
death
that
must
that
thirst
allay
but
while
he
sat
and
waited
for
the
day
a
sudden
light
across
the
bare
rock
streamed
which
at
the
first
he
noted
not
but
deemed
the
moon
her
fleecy
veil
had
broken
through
but
ruddier
indeed
this
new
light
grew
than
were
the
moon
grey
beams
and
therewithal
soft
music
on
his
ears
did
fall
yet
moved
he
not
but
murmured
this
is
death
an
easy
thing
like
this
to
yield
my
breath
awake
yet
dreaming
with
no
sounds
of
fear
no
dreadful
sights
to
tell
me
it
is
near
yea
god
i
thank
thee
but
with
that
last
word
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
his
own
name
heard
whispered
as
though
the
wind
had
borne
it
past
with
that
he
gat
unto
his
feet
at
last
but
still
awhile
he
stood
with
sunken
head
and
in
a
low
and
trembling
voice
he
said
lord
i
am
ready
whither
shall
i
go
i
pray
thee
unto
me
some
token
show
and
as
he
said
this
round
about
he
turned
and
in
the
east
beheld
a
light
that
burned
as
bright
as
day
then
though
his
flesh
might
fear
the
coming
change
that
he
believed
so
near
yet
did
his
soul
rejoice
for
now
he
thought
unto
the
very
heaven
to
be
brought
and
though
he
felt
alive
deemed
it
might
be
that
he
in
sleep
had
died
full
easily
then
toward
that
light
did
he
begin
to
go
and
still
those
strains
he
heard
far
off
and
low
that
grew
no
louder
still
that
bright
light
streamed
over
the
rocks
yet
nothing
brighter
seemed
but
like
the
light
of
some
unseen
bright
flame
shone
round
about
until
at
last
he
came
unto
the
dreary
islet
other
shore
and
then
the
minstrelsy
he
heard
no
more
and
softer
seemed
the
strange
light
unto
him
but
yet
or
ever
it
had
grown
quite
dim
beneath
its
waning
light
could
he
behold
a
mighty
palace
set
about
with
gold
above
green
meads
and
groves
of
summer
trees
across
the
welter
of
the
seas
but
as
he
gazed
it
faded
from
his
sight
and
the
grey
hidden
moon
diffused
soft
light
which
soothly
was
but
darkness
to
him
now
his
island
prison
did
but
show
but
the
sea
he
still
gazed
wistfully
and
said
alas
and
when
will
this
go
by
and
leave
my
soul
in
peace
must
i
still
dream
of
life
that
once
so
dear
a
thing
did
seem
that
when
i
wake
death
may
the
bitterer
be
here
will
i
sit
until
he
come
to
me
and
hide
mine
eyes
and
think
upon
my
sin
that
so
a
little
calm
i
yet
may
win
before
i
stand
within
the
awful
place
then
down
he
sat
and
covered
up
his
face
yet
therewithal
his
trouble
could
not
hide
nor
waiting
thus
for
death
could
he
abide
for
though
he
knew
it
not
the
yearning
pain
of
hope
of
life
had
touched
his
soul
again
if
he
could
live
awhile
if
he
could
live
the
mighty
being
who
once
was
wont
to
give
the
gift
of
life
to
many
a
trembling
man
who
did
his
own
will
since
his
life
began
who
feared
not
aught
but
strong
and
great
and
free
still
cast
aside
the
thought
of
what
might
be
must
all
this
then
be
lost
and
with
no
will
powerless
and
blind
must
he
some
fate
fulfil
nor
know
what
he
is
doing
any
more
soon
he
arose
and
paced
along
the
shore
and
gazed
out
seaward
for
the
blessed
light
but
nought
he
saw
except
the
old
sad
sight
the
ceaseless
tumbling
of
the
billows
grey
the
white
upspringing
of
the
spurts
of
spray
amidst
that
mass
of
timbers
the
rent
bones
of
the
of
the
hapless
ones
once
cast
like
him
upon
this
deadly
isle
he
stopped
his
pacing
in
a
little
while
and
clenched
his
mighty
hands
and
set
his
teeth
and
gazing
at
the
ruin
underneath
he
swung
from
off
the
bare
cliff
jagged
brow
and
on
some
slippery
ledge
he
wavered
now
without
a
and
now
stoutly
clung
with
hands
alone
and
the
welter
hung
not
caring
aught
if
thus
his
life
should
end
but
safely
amidst
all
this
did
he
descend
the
dreadful
cliff
and
since
no
beach
was
there
but
from
the
depths
the
rock
rose
stark
and
bare
nor
crumbled
aught
beneath
the
hammering
sea
upon
the
wrecks
he
stood
unsteadily
but
now
amid
the
clamour
of
the
waves
and
washing
of
beams
and
staves
dizzy
with
hunger
dreamy
with
distress
and
all
those
days
of
fear
and
loneliness
the
ocean
tumult
seemed
the
battle
roar
his
heart
grew
hot
as
when
in
days
of
yore
he
heard
the
cymbals
clash
amid
the
crowd
of
dusky
faces
now
he
shouted
loud
and
from
crushed
beam
to
beam
began
to
leap
and
yet
his
footing
somehow
did
he
keep
amidst
their
tossing
and
indeed
the
sea
was
somewhat
sunk
upon
the
island
lee
so
quickly
on
from
wreck
to
wreck
he
passed
and
reached
the
outer
line
of
wrecks
at
last
and
there
a
moment
stood
unsteadily
amid
the
drift
of
spray
that
hurried
by
and
drew
courtain
his
sword
from
out
its
sheath
and
poised
himself
to
meet
the
coming
death
still
looking
out
to
sea
but
as
he
gazed
and
once
or
twice
his
doubtful
feet
he
raised
to
take
the
final
plunge
that
heavenly
strain
over
the
washing
waves
he
heard
again
and
from
the
dimness
something
bright
he
saw
across
the
waste
of
waters
towards
him
draw
and
hidden
now
now
raised
aloft
at
last
unto
his
very
feet
a
boat
was
cast
gilded
inside
and
out
and
well
arrayed
with
cushions
soft
far
fitter
to
have
weighed
from
some
sweet
garden
on
the
shallow
seine
or
in
a
reach
of
green
thames
to
have
lain
than
struggle
with
that
huge
confuséd
sea
but
ogier
gazed
upon
it
doubtfully
one
moment
and
then
sheathing
courtain
said
what
tales
are
these
about
the
newly
dead
the
heathen
told
what
matter
let
all
pass
this
moment
as
one
dead
indeed
i
was
and
this
must
be
what
i
have
got
to
do
i
yet
perchance
may
light
on
something
new
before
i
die
though
yet
perchance
this
keel
unto
the
wondrous
mass
of
charméd
steel
is
drawn
as
others
with
that
word
he
leapt
into
the
boat
and
the
cushions
crept
from
stem
to
stern
but
found
no
rudder
there
nor
any
oars
nor
were
the
cushions
fair
made
wet
by
any
dashing
of
the
sea
now
while
he
pondered
how
these
things
could
be
the
boat
began
to
move
therefrom
at
last
but
over
him
a
drowsiness
was
cast
and
as
tumbling
hills
the
skiff
did
pass
he
clean
forgot
his
death
and
where
he
was
at
last
he
woke
up
to
a
sunny
day
and
looking
round
saw
that
his
shallop
lay
moored
at
the
edge
of
some
fair
tideless
sea
unto
an
overhanging
tree
where
in
the
green
waves
did
the
low
bank
dip
its
fresh
and
green
daisied
lip
but
ogier
looking
thence
no
more
could
see
that
sad
abode
of
death
and
misery
nor
aught
but
wide
and
empty
ocean
grey
with
gathering
haze
for
now
it
neared
midday
then
from
the
golden
cushions
did
he
rise
and
wondering
still
if
this
were
paradise
he
stepped
ashore
but
drew
courtain
his
sword
and
muttered
therewithal
a
holy
word
fair
was
the
place
as
though
amidst
of
may
nor
did
the
brown
birds
fear
the
sunny
day
for
with
their
quivering
song
the
air
was
sweet
thick
grew
the
underneath
his
feet
and
on
his
head
the
blossoms
down
did
rain
yet
mid
these
fair
things
slowly
and
with
pain
he
to
go
yea
even
when
his
foot
first
touched
the
flowery
sod
to
his
heart
root
a
coldness
seemed
to
strike
and
now
each
limb
was
growing
stiff
his
eyes
waxed
bleared
and
dim
and
all
his
memory
to
fail
nor
yet
would
his
once
mighty
heart
avail
for
lamentations
his
changéd
lot
yet
urged
by
some
desire
he
knew
not
what
along
a
little
path
hedges
sweet
drawn
sword
in
hand
he
dragged
his
faltering
feet
for
what
then
seemed
to
him
a
weary
way
whereon
his
steps
he
needs
must
often
stay
and
lean
upon
the
mighty
sword
that
in
those
hands
grown
old
for
king
or
lord
had
small
respect
in
glorious
days
long
past
but
still
he
crept
along
and
at
the
last
came
to
a
gilded
wicket
and
through
this
entered
a
garden
fit
for
utmost
bliss
if
that
might
last
which
needs
must
soon
go
by
there
a
tree
he
leaned
and
with
a
sigh
he
said
o
god
a
sinner
i
have
been
and
good
it
is
that
i
these
things
have
seen
before
i
meet
what
thou
hast
set
apart
to
cleanse
the
earthly
folly
from
my
heart
but
who
within
this
garden
now
can
dwell
wherein
guilt
first
upon
the
world
befell
a
little
further
yet
he
staggered
on
till
to
a
at
last
he
won
which
two
their
sweet
blossoms
shed
there
he
sank
down
and
laid
his
weary
head
beside
the
mossy
roots
and
in
a
while
he
slept
and
dreamed
himself
within
the
isle
that
splashing
fount
the
weary
sea
did
seem
and
in
his
dream
the
fair
place
but
a
dream
but
when
again
to
feebleness
he
woke
upon
his
ears
that
heavenly
music
broke
not
faint
or
far
as
in
the
isle
it
was
but
as
though
the
minstrels
now
did
pass
anigh
his
then
fallen
in
doubt
as
he
might
he
rose
and
gazed
about
leaning
against
the
hawthorn
stem
with
pain
and
yet
his
straining
gaze
was
but
in
vain
death
stole
so
fast
upon
him
and
no
more
could
he
behold
the
blossoms
as
before
no
more
the
trees
seemed
rooted
to
the
ground
a
heavy
mist
seemed
gathering
all
around
and
in
its
heart
some
bright
thing
seemed
to
be
and
round
his
head
there
breathed
deliciously
sweet
odours
and
that
music
never
ceased
but
as
the
weight
of
death
strong
hand
increased
again
he
sank
adown
and
courtain
noise
within
the
scabbard
seemed
a
farewell
voice
sent
from
the
world
he
loved
so
well
of
old
and
all
his
life
was
as
a
story
told
and
as
he
thought
thereof
he
to
smile
as
a
child
asleep
but
in
a
while
it
was
as
though
he
slept
and
sleeping
dreamed
for
in
his
eyes
a
glory
gleamed
as
though
from
some
sweet
face
and
golden
hair
and
on
his
breast
were
laid
soft
hands
and
fair
and
a
sweet
voice
was
ringing
in
his
ears
broken
as
if
with
flow
of
joyous
tears
ogier
sweet
friend
hast
thou
not
tarried
long
alas
thine
hundred
years
of
strife
and
wrong
then
he
found
voice
to
say
alas
dear
lord
too
long
too
long
and
yet
one
little
word
right
many
a
year
agone
had
brought
me
here
then
to
his
face
that
face
was
drawn
anear
he
felt
his
head
raised
up
and
gently
laid
on
some
kind
knee
again
the
sweet
voice
said
nay
ogier
nay
not
yet
not
yet
dear
friend
who
knoweth
when
our
linkéd
life
shall
end
since
thou
art
come
unto
mine
arms
at
last
and
all
the
turmoil
of
the
world
is
past
why
do
i
linger
ere
i
see
thy
face
as
i
desired
it
in
that
mourning
place
so
many
years
ago
so
many
years
thou
knewest
not
thy
love
and
all
her
fears
alas
he
said
what
mockery
then
is
this
that
thou
wilt
speak
to
me
of
earthly
bliss
no
longer
can
i
think
upon
the
earth
have
i
not
done
with
all
its
grief
and
mirth
yes
i
was
ogier
once
but
if
my
love
should
come
once
more
my
dying
heart
to
move
then
must
she
come
from
the
walls
whereon
the
hawthorn
blossom
falls
outside
omer
art
thou
she
her
name
which
i
remembered
once
mid
death
and
fame
is
clean
forgotten
now
but
yesterday
meseems
our
son
upon
her
bosom
lay
baldwin
the
fair
what
hast
thou
done
with
him
since
charlot
slew
him
all
mine
eyes
wax
dim
woman
forbear
wilt
thou
not
let
me
die
did
i
forget
thee
in
the
days
gone
by
then
let
me
die
that
we
may
meet
again
he
tried
to
move
from
her
but
all
in
vain
for
life
had
left
him
but
withal
he
felt
a
kiss
upon
his
forehead
fall
and
could
not
speak
he
felt
slim
fingers
fair
move
to
his
mighty
hand
and
there
set
on
some
ring
and
still
he
could
not
speak
and
once
more
sleep
weighed
down
his
eyelids
weak
but
ah
what
land
was
this
he
woke
unto
what
joy
was
this
that
filled
his
heart
anew
had
he
then
gained
the
very
paradise
trembling
he
durst
not
at
the
first
arise
although
no
more
he
felt
the
pain
of
eld
nor
durst
he
raise
his
eyes
that
now
beheld
beside
him
the
white
flowers
and
blades
of
grass
he
durst
not
speak
lest
he
some
monster
was
but
while
he
lay
and
hoped
that
gentle
voice
once
more
he
heard
yea
thou
mayst
well
rejoice
thou
livest
still
my
sweet
thou
livest
still
apart
from
every
earthly
fear
and
ill
wilt
thou
not
love
me
who
have
wrought
thee
this
that
i
like
thee
may
live
in
double
bliss
then
ogier
rose
up
nowise
like
to
one
whose
span
of
earthly
life
is
nigh
outrun
but
as
he
might
have
risen
in
old
days
to
see
the
spears
cleave
the
fresh
morning
haze
but
looking
round
he
saw
no
change
there
was
in
the
fair
place
wherethrough
he
first
did
pass
though
all
grown
clear
and
joyous
to
his
eyes
now
looked
no
worse
than
very
paradise
behind
him
were
the
thorns
the
fountain
fair
still
sent
its
glittering
stream
forth
into
air
and
by
its
basin
a
fair
woman
stood
and
as
their
eyes
met
his
blood
rushed
to
his
face
with
unused
thoughts
and
sweet
and
hurrying
hopes
his
heart
began
to
beat
the
fairest
of
all
creatures
did
she
seem
so
fresh
and
delicate
you
well
might
deem
that
scarce
for
eighteen
summers
had
she
blessed
the
happy
longing
world
yet
for
the
rest
within
her
glorious
eyes
such
wisdom
dwelt
a
child
before
her
had
the
wise
man
felt
and
with
the
pleasure
of
a
thousand
years
her
lips
were
fashioned
to
move
joy
or
tears
among
the
longing
folk
where
she
might
dwell
to
give
at
last
the
kiss
unspeakable
in
such
wise
was
she
clad
as
folk
may
be
who
for
no
shame
of
their
humanity
for
no
sad
changes
of
the
imperfect
year
rather
for
added
beauty
raiment
wear
for
as
the
haze
veils
the
green
flowery
morn
of
late
her
raiment
veiled
her
where
the
bands
did
meet
that
bound
the
sandals
to
her
dainty
feet
gems
gleamed
a
fresh
embraced
her
head
and
on
her
breast
there
lay
a
ruby
red
so
with
a
supplicating
look
she
turned
to
meet
the
flame
that
in
his
own
eyes
burned
and
held
out
both
her
white
arms
lovingly
as
though
to
greet
him
as
he
drew
anigh
stammering
he
said
who
art
thou
how
am
i
so
cured
of
all
my
evils
suddenly
that
certainly
i
felt
no
mightier
when
amid
the
backward
rush
of
beaten
men
about
me
drooped
the
oriflamme
alas
i
fear
that
in
some
dream
i
am
ogier
she
said
draw
near
perchance
it
is
that
such
a
name
god
gives
unto
our
bliss
i
know
not
but
if
thou
art
such
an
one
as
i
must
deem
all
days
beneath
the
sun
that
thou
hadst
had
shall
be
but
dreams
indeed
to
those
that
i
have
given
thee
at
thy
need
for
many
years
ago
beside
the
sea
when
thou
wert
born
i
plighted
troth
with
thee
come
near
then
and
make
mirrors
of
mine
eyes
that
thou
mayst
see
what
these
my
mysteries
have
wrought
in
thee
surely
but
thirty
years
passed
amidst
joy
thy
new
born
body
bears
nor
while
thou
art
with
me
and
on
this
shore
art
still
of
love
shalt
thou
seem
more
nay
love
come
nigher
and
let
me
take
thine
hand
the
hope
and
fear
of
many
a
warring
land
and
i
will
show
thee
wherein
lies
the
spell
whereby
this
happy
change
upon
thee
fell
like
a
shy
youth
before
some
royal
love
close
up
to
that
fair
woman
did
he
move
and
their
hands
met
yet
to
his
changéd
voice
he
dared
not
trust
nay
scarcely
could
rejoice
when
her
balmy
breath
he
to
feel
and
felt
strange
sweetness
his
spirit
steal
as
her
light
raiment
driven
by
the
wind
swept
round
him
and
bewildered
and
his
lips
the
treasure
of
her
lips
did
press
and
round
him
clung
her
perfect
loveliness
for
one
sweet
moment
thus
they
stood
and
then
she
drew
herself
from
out
his
arms
again
and
panting
lovelier
for
her
love
did
stand
apart
awhile
then
took
her
lover
hand
and
in
a
trembling
voice
made
haste
to
say
o
ogier
when
thou
camest
here
i
feared
indeed
that
in
my
play
with
fate
i
might
have
seen
thee
one
day
too
late
before
this
ring
thy
finger
should
embrace
behold
it
love
and
thy
keen
eyes
may
trace
faint
figures
wrought
upon
the
ruddy
gold
my
father
dying
gave
it
me
nor
told
the
manner
of
its
making
but
i
know
that
it
can
make
thee
as
thou
art
now
despite
the
laws
of
god
shrink
not
from
me
because
i
give
an
impious
gift
to
thee
has
not
god
made
me
also
who
do
this
but
i
who
longed
to
share
with
thee
my
bliss
am
of
the
fays
and
live
their
changeless
life
and
like
the
gods
of
old
i
see
the
strife
that
moves
the
world
unmoved
if
so
i
will
for
we
the
fruit
that
teaches
good
and
ill
have
never
touched
like
you
of
adam
race
and
while
thou
dwellest
with
me
in
this
place
thus
shalt
thou
be
ah
and
thou
indeed
that
thou
shalt
gain
thereby
no
happy
meed
reft
of
the
world
joys
nor
canst
understand
how
thou
art
come
into
a
happy
land
love
in
thy
world
the
priests
of
heaven
still
sing
and
tell
thee
of
it
many
a
joyous
thing
but
thou
bearing
the
world
joy
and
pain
thou
couldst
live
there
nay
nay
but
born
again
thou
wouldst
be
happy
with
the
angels
bliss
and
so
with
us
no
otherwise
it
is
nor
hast
thou
cast
thine
old
life
quite
away
even
as
yet
though
that
shall
be
but
for
the
love
and
country
thou
hast
won
know
thou
that
thou
art
come
to
avallon
that
is
both
thine
and
mine
and
as
for
me
morgan
le
fay
men
call
me
commonly
within
the
world
but
fairer
names
than
this
i
have
for
thee
and
me
kiss
and
kiss
ah
what
was
this
and
was
it
all
in
vain
that
she
had
brought
him
here
this
life
to
gain
for
ere
her
speech
was
done
like
one
turned
blind
he
watched
the
kisses
of
the
wandering
wind
within
her
raiment
or
as
some
one
sees
the
very
best
of
images
when
he
is
blind
with
grief
did
he
behold
the
wandering
tresses
of
her
locks
of
gold
upon
her
shoulders
and
no
more
he
pressed
the
hand
that
in
his
own
hand
lay
at
rest
his
eyes
grown
dull
with
changing
memories
could
make
no
answer
to
her
glorious
eyes
cold
waxed
his
heart
and
weary
and
distraught
with
many
a
hateful
dreary
thought
unfinished
in
the
old
days
and
withal
he
needs
must
think
of
what
might
chance
to
fall
in
this
life
and
good
and
bad
tormented
him
because
as
yet
he
had
a
worldly
heart
within
his
frame
made
new
and
to
the
deeds
that
he
was
wont
to
do
did
his
desires
still
turn
but
she
a
while
stood
gazing
at
him
with
a
doubtful
smile
and
let
his
hand
fall
down
and
suddenly
sounded
sweet
music
from
some
close
nearby
and
then
she
spoke
again
come
love
with
me
that
thou
thy
new
life
and
delights
mayst
see
and
gently
with
that
word
she
led
him
thence
and
though
upon
him
now
there
fell
a
sense
of
dreamy
and
unreal
bewilderment
as
hand
in
hand
through
that
green
place
they
went
yet
therewithal
a
strain
of
tender
love
a
little
yet
his
restless
heart
did
move
so
through
the
whispering
trees
they
came
at
last
to
where
a
wondrous
house
a
shadow
cast
across
the
flowers
and
the
daisied
grass
before
it
crowds
of
lovely
folk
did
pass
playing
about
in
carelessness
and
mirth
unshadowed
by
the
doubtful
deeds
of
earth
and
from
the
midst
a
band
of
fair
girls
came
with
flowers
and
music
greeting
him
by
name
and
praising
him
but
ever
like
a
dream
he
could
not
break
did
all
to
ogier
seem
and
he
his
old
world
did
the
more
desire
for
in
his
heart
still
burned
unquenched
the
fire
that
through
the
world
of
old
so
bright
did
burn
yet
was
he
fain
that
kindness
to
return
and
from
the
depth
of
his
full
heart
he
sighed
then
toward
the
house
the
lovely
queen
did
guide
his
listless
steps
and
seemed
to
take
no
thought
of
knitted
brow
or
wandering
eyes
distraught
but
still
with
kind
love
lighting
up
her
face
she
led
him
through
the
door
of
that
fair
place
while
round
about
them
did
the
damsels
press
and
he
was
moved
by
all
that
loveliness
as
one
might
be
who
lying
half
asleep
in
the
may
morning
notes
the
light
wind
sweep
over
the
no
more
to
him
were
gleaming
eyes
red
lips
and
bodies
slim
amidst
that
dream
although
the
first
surprise
of
hurried
love
wherewith
the
queen
sweet
eyes
had
smitten
him
still
in
his
heart
did
stir
and
so
at
last
he
came
led
on
by
her
into
a
hall
wherein
a
fair
throne
was
and
hand
in
hand
thereto
the
twain
did
pass
and
there
she
bade
him
sit
and
when
alone
he
took
his
place
upon
the
double
throne
she
cast
herself
before
him
on
her
knees
embracing
his
and
greatly
did
increase
the
shame
and
love
that
vexed
his
troubled
heart
but
now
a
line
of
girls
the
crowd
did
part
lovelier
than
all
and
ogier
could
behold
one
in
their
midst
who
bore
a
crown
of
gold
within
her
slender
hands
and
delicate
she
drawing
nigh
beside
the
throne
did
wait
until
the
queen
arose
and
took
the
crown
who
then
to
ogier
lips
did
stoop
adown
and
kissed
him
and
said
ogier
what
were
worth
thy
miserable
days
of
strife
on
earth
that
on
their
ashes
still
thine
eyes
are
turned
then
as
she
spoke
these
words
his
changed
heart
burned
with
sudden
memories
and
thereto
had
he
made
answer
but
she
raised
up
suddenly
the
crown
she
held
and
set
it
on
his
head
ogier
she
cried
those
troublous
days
are
dead
thou
wert
dead
with
them
also
but
for
me
turn
unto
her
who
wrought
these
things
for
thee
then
as
he
felt
her
touch
a
mighty
wave
of
love
swept
his
soul
as
though
the
grave
did
really
hold
his
body
from
his
seat
he
rose
to
cast
himself
before
her
feet
but
she
clung
round
him
and
in
close
embrace
the
twain
were
locked
amidst
that
thronging
place
thenceforth
new
life
indeed
has
ogier
won
and
in
the
happy
land
of
avallon
quick
glide
the
years
his
unchanging
head
there
saw
he
many
men
the
world
thought
dead
living
like
him
in
sweet
forgetfulness
of
all
the
troubles
that
did
once
oppress
their
lives
ah
how
can
i
tell
of
their
joy
as
though
i
had
been
nigh
suffice
it
that
no
fear
of
death
they
knew
that
there
no
talk
there
was
of
false
or
true
of
right
or
wrong
for
traitors
came
not
there
that
everything
was
bright
and
soft
and
fair
and
yet
they
wearied
not
for
any
change
nor
unto
them
did
constancy
seem
strange
love
knew
they
but
its
pain
they
never
had
but
with
each
other
joy
were
they
made
glad
nor
were
their
lives
wasted
by
hidden
fire
nor
knew
they
of
the
unfulfilled
desire
that
turns
to
ashes
all
the
joys
of
earth
nor
knew
they
yearning
love
amidst
the
dearth
of
kind
and
loving
hearts
to
spend
it
on
nor
dreamed
of
discontent
when
all
was
won
nor
need
they
struggle
after
wealth
and
fame
still
was
the
calm
flow
of
their
lives
the
same
and
yet
i
say
they
wearied
not
of
it
so
did
the
promised
days
by
ogier
flit
think
that
a
hundred
years
have
now
passed
by
since
ye
beheld
ogier
lie
down
to
die
beside
the
fountain
think
that
now
ye
are
in
france
made
dangerous
with
wasting
war
in
paris
where
about
each
guarded
gate
gathered
in
knots
the
anxious
people
wait
and
press
around
each
man
to
learn
if
harfleur
now
the
pagan
wasters
burn
or
if
the
rouen
folk
can
keep
their
chain
or
pont
de
unburnt
still
guards
the
seine
or
if
is
true
that
andelys
succour
wants
that
vernon
folk
are
fleeing
east
to
mantes
when
will
they
come
or
rather
is
it
true
that
a
great
band
the
constable
upon
the
marshes
of
the
lower
seine
and
that
their
turning
back
again
caught
by
the
waters
of
the
bore
were
driven
here
and
there
and
cast
ashore
such
questions
did
they
ask
and
as
fresh
men
came
hurrying
in
they
asked
them
again
and
from
scared
folk
or
fools
or
ignorant
still
got
new
lies
or
tidings
very
scant
but
now
amidst
these
men
at
last
came
one
a
little
ere
the
setting
of
the
sun
with
two
stout
men
behind
him
armed
right
well
who
ever
as
they
rode
on
sooth
to
tell
with
doubtful
eyes
upon
their
master
stared
or
looked
about
like
troubled
men
and
scared
and
he
they
served
was
noteworthy
indeed
of
ancient
fashion
were
his
arms
and
weed
rich
past
the
wont
of
men
in
those
sad
times
his
face
was
bronzed
as
though
by
burning
climes
but
lovely
as
the
image
of
a
god
carved
in
the
days
before
on
earth
christ
trod
but
solemn
were
his
eyes
and
grey
as
glass
and
like
to
ruddy
gold
his
fine
hair
was
a
mighty
man
he
was
and
taller
far
than
those
who
on
that
day
must
bear
the
war
the
pagans
waged
he
by
the
warders
stayed
scarce
looked
on
them
but
straight
their
words
obeyed
and
showed
his
pass
then
asked
about
his
name
and
from
what
city
of
the
world
he
came
said
that
men
called
him
now
the
ancient
knight
that
he
was
come
midst
the
king
men
to
fight
from
omer
and
as
he
spoke
he
gazed
down
on
the
thronging
street
as
one
amazed
and
answered
no
more
to
the
questioning
of
frightened
folk
of
this
or
that
sad
thing
but
ere
he
passed
on
turned
about
at
last
and
on
the
wondering
guard
a
strange
look
cast
and
said
mary
do
such
men
as
ye
fight
with
the
wasters
from
across
the
sea
then
certes
are
ye
lost
however
good
your
hearts
may
be
not
such
were
those
who
stood
beside
the
years
agone
so
said
he
and
as
his
fair
armour
shone
with
beauty
of
a
time
long
passed
away
so
with
the
music
of
another
day
his
deep
voice
thrilled
the
listening
folk
yet
from
the
crowd
a
mocking
voice
outbroke
that
cried
be
merry
masters
fear
ye
nought
surely
good
succour
to
our
side
is
brought
for
here
is
charlemaine
come
off
his
tomb
to
save
his
faithful
city
from
its
doom
yea
said
another
this
is
certain
news
surely
ye
know
how
all
the
carvers
use
to
carve
the
dead
man
image
at
the
best
that
guards
the
place
where
he
may
lie
at
rest
wherefore
this
living
image
looks
indeed
spite
of
his
ancient
tongue
and
marvellous
weed
to
have
but
thirty
summers
at
the
name
of
charlemaine
he
turned
to
whence
there
came
the
mocking
voice
and
somewhat
knit
his
brow
and
seemed
as
he
would
speak
but
scarce
knew
how
so
with
a
soon
sank
back
again
into
his
dream
and
shook
his
rein
and
silently
went
on
upon
his
way
and
this
was
ogier
on
what
evil
day
has
he
then
stumbled
that
he
needs
must
come
midst
war
and
ravage
to
the
ancient
home
of
his
desires
did
he
grow
weary
then
and
wish
to
strive
once
more
with
foolish
men
for
worthless
things
or
is
fair
avallon
sunk
in
the
sea
and
all
that
glory
gone
nay
thus
it
happed
one
day
she
came
to
him
and
said
ogier
thy
name
is
waxing
dim
upon
the
world
that
thou
rememberest
not
the
heathen
men
are
thick
on
many
a
spot
thine
eyes
have
seen
and
which
i
love
therefore
and
god
will
give
his
wonted
help
no
more
wilt
thou
then
help
canst
thou
have
any
mind
to
give
thy
banner
once
more
to
the
wind
since
greater
glory
thou
shalt
win
for
this
than
erst
thou
gatheredst
ere
thou
to
bliss
for
men
are
dwindled
both
in
heart
and
frame
nor
holds
the
fair
land
any
such
a
name
as
thine
when
thou
wert
living
midst
thy
peers
the
world
is
worser
for
these
hundred
years
from
his
calm
eyes
there
gleamed
a
little
fire
and
in
his
voice
was
something
of
desire
to
see
the
land
where
he
was
used
to
be
as
now
he
answered
nay
choose
thou
for
me
thou
art
the
wisest
it
is
more
than
well
within
this
peaceful
place
with
thee
to
dwell
nor
ill
perchance
in
that
old
land
to
die
if
dying
i
keep
not
the
memory
of
this
fair
life
of
ours
nay
nay
said
she
as
to
thy
dying
that
shall
never
be
whiles
that
thou
my
ring
and
now
behold
i
take
from
thee
thy
charmed
crown
of
gold
and
thou
wilt
be
the
ogier
that
thou
wast
ere
on
the
loadstone
rock
thy
ship
was
cast
yet
thou
shalt
have
thy
youthful
body
still
and
i
will
guard
thy
life
from
every
so
was
it
done
and
ogier
armed
right
well
sleeping
was
borne
away
by
some
strong
spell
and
set
upon
the
flemish
coast
and
thence
turned
to
omer
with
a
doubtful
sense
of
being
in
some
wild
dream
the
while
he
knew
that
great
delight
forgotten
was
his
due
that
all
which
there
might
hap
was
of
small
worth
so
on
he
went
and
sometimes
unto
mirth
did
his
attire
move
the
but
oftener
when
strange
speeches
from
him
broke
concerning
men
and
things
for
long
years
dead
he
filled
the
listeners
with
great
awe
and
dread
for
in
such
wild
times
as
these
people
were
are
men
soon
moved
to
wonder
and
to
fear
now
through
the
streets
of
paris
did
he
ride
and
at
a
certain
hostel
did
abide
throughout
that
night
and
ere
he
went
next
day
he
saw
a
book
that
on
a
table
lay
and
opening
it
read
in
lazy
mood
but
long
before
it
in
that
place
he
stood
noting
nought
else
for
it
did
chronicle
the
deeds
of
men
whom
once
he
knew
right
well
when
they
were
living
in
the
flesh
with
him
yea
his
own
deeds
he
saw
grown
strange
and
dim
already
and
true
stories
mixed
with
lies
until
with
many
thronging
memories
of
those
old
days
his
heart
was
so
oppressed
he
to
wish
that
he
might
lie
at
rest
forgetting
all
things
for
indeed
by
this
little
remembrance
had
he
of
the
bliss
that
wrapped
his
soul
in
peaceful
avallon
but
his
changed
life
he
needs
must
carry
on
for
ye
shall
know
the
queen
was
gathering
men
to
send
unto
the
good
king
who
as
then
in
rouen
lay
beset
by
many
a
band
of
those
who
carried
terror
through
the
land
and
still
by
messengers
for
help
he
prayed
therefore
a
mighty
muster
was
being
made
of
weak
and
strong
and
brave
and
timorous
before
the
queen
anigh
her
royal
house
so
thither
on
this
morn
did
ogier
turn
some
certain
news
about
the
war
to
learn
and
when
he
came
at
last
into
the
square
and
saw
the
ancient
palace
great
and
fair
rise
up
before
him
as
in
other
days
and
in
the
merry
morn
the
bright
sun
rays
glittering
on
gathered
helms
and
moving
spears
he
to
feel
as
in
the
years
and
his
heart
stirred
within
him
now
the
queen
came
from
within
right
royally
beseen
and
took
her
seat
beneath
a
canopy
with
lords
and
captains
of
the
war
anigh
and
as
she
came
a
mighty
shout
arose
and
round
about
began
the
knights
to
close
their
oath
of
fealty
to
swear
anew
and
learn
what
service
they
had
got
to
do
but
so
it
was
that
some
their
shouts
must
stay
to
gaze
at
ogier
as
he
took
his
way
through
the
thronged
place
and
quickly
too
he
gat
unto
the
place
whereas
the
lady
sat
for
men
gave
place
unto
him
fearing
him
for
not
alone
was
he
most
huge
of
limb
and
dangerous
but
something
in
his
face
as
his
calm
eyes
looked
the
crowded
place
struck
men
with
awe
and
in
the
ancient
days
when
men
might
hope
alive
on
gods
to
gaze
they
would
have
thought
the
gods
yet
love
our
town
and
from
the
heavens
have
sent
a
great
one
down
withal
unto
the
throne
he
came
so
near
that
he
the
queen
sweet
measured
voice
could
hear
and
swiftly
now
within
him
wrought
the
change
that
first
he
felt
amid
those
faces
strange
and
his
heart
burned
to
taste
the
hurrying
life
with
such
desires
such
changing
sweetness
rife
and
yet
indeed
how
should
he
live
alone
who
in
the
old
past
days
such
friends
had
known
then
he
began
to
think
of
caraheu
of
bellicent
the
fair
and
once
more
knew
the
bitter
pain
of
rent
and
ended
love
but
while
with
hope
and
vain
regret
he
strove
he
found
none
him
and
the
queen
high
seat
and
stepping
forth
he
knelt
before
her
feet
and
took
her
hand
to
swear
as
was
the
way
of
doing
fealty
in
that
ancient
day
and
raised
his
eyes
to
hers
as
fair
was
she
as
any
woman
of
the
world
might
be
and
tall
from
her
deep
eyes
the
snare
of
fools
the
ruin
of
the
wise
love
looked
unchecked
and
now
her
dainty
hand
the
holder
of
the
golden
wand
trembled
in
his
she
cast
her
eyes
adown
and
her
sweet
brow
was
knitted
to
a
frown
as
he
the
taker
of
such
oaths
of
yore
now
unto
her
all
due
obedience
swore
yet
gave
himself
no
name
and
now
the
queen
awed
by
his
voice
as
other
folk
had
been
yet
felt
a
trembling
hope
within
her
rise
too
sweet
to
think
of
and
with
love
surprise
her
cheek
grew
pale
she
said
thy
style
and
name
thou
tellest
not
nor
what
land
of
thy
fame
is
glad
for
certes
some
land
must
be
glad
that
in
its
bounds
her
house
thy
mother
had
lady
he
said
from
what
far
land
i
come
i
well
might
tell
thee
but
another
home
have
i
long
dwelt
in
and
its
name
have
i
forgotten
now
forgotten
utterly
who
were
my
fellows
and
what
deeds
they
did
therefore
indeed
shall
my
first
name
be
hid
and
my
first
country
call
me
on
this
day
the
ancient
knight
and
let
me
go
my
way
he
rose
withal
for
she
her
fingers
fair
had
drawn
aback
and
on
him
to
stare
as
one
afeard
for
something
terrible
was
in
his
speech
and
that
she
knew
right
well
who
to
love
him
and
to
fear
that
she
shut
out
by
some
strange
deadly
mystery
should
never
gain
from
him
an
equal
love
yet
as
from
her
high
seat
he
to
move
she
said
o
ancient
knight
come
presently
when
we
have
done
this
muster
unto
me
and
thou
shalt
have
thy
charge
and
due
command
for
freeing
from
our
foes
this
wretched
land
then
ogier
made
his
reverence
and
went
and
somewhat
could
perceive
of
her
intent
for
in
his
heart
life
grew
and
love
with
life
grew
and
therewith
love
and
fame
was
strife
but
as
he
slowly
gat
him
from
the
square
gazing
at
all
the
people
gathered
there
a
squire
of
the
queen
behind
him
came
and
breathless
called
him
by
his
name
and
bade
him
turn
because
the
queen
now
bade
since
by
the
muster
long
she
might
be
stayed
that
to
the
palace
he
should
bring
him
straight
midst
sport
and
play
her
coming
back
to
wait
then
ogier
turned
nought
loath
and
with
him
went
and
to
a
his
steps
he
bent
that
ogier
knew
right
well
in
days
of
old
worn
was
it
now
and
the
bright
hues
and
gold
upon
the
shields
above
with
lapse
of
days
were
faded
much
but
now
did
ogier
gaze
upon
the
garden
where
he
walked
of
yore
holding
the
hands
that
he
should
see
no
more
for
all
was
changed
except
the
palace
fair
that
charlemaine
own
eyes
had
seen
built
there
ere
ogier
knew
him
there
the
squire
did
lead
the
ancient
knight
who
still
took
little
heed
of
all
the
things
that
by
the
way
he
said
for
all
his
thoughts
were
on
the
days
long
dead
there
in
the
painted
hall
he
sat
again
and
the
pictured
eyes
of
charlemaine
he
ate
and
drank
and
felt
it
like
a
dream
and
midst
his
growing
longings
yet
might
deem
that
he
from
sleep
should
wake
up
presently
in
some
fair
city
on
the
syrian
sea
or
on
the
brown
rocks
of
the
loadstone
isle
but
fain
to
be
alone
within
a
while
he
gat
him
to
the
garden
and
there
passed
by
wondering
squires
and
damsels
till
at
last
far
from
the
merry
folk
who
needs
must
play
if
on
the
world
were
coming
its
last
day
he
sat
him
down
and
through
his
mind
there
ran
faint
thoughts
of
that
day
when
outworn
and
wan
he
lay
down
by
the
to
die
but
when
he
strove
to
gain
clear
memory
of
what
had
happed
since
on
the
isle
he
lay
waiting
for
death
a
hopeless
castaway
thought
failing
him
would
rather
bring
again
his
life
among
the
peers
of
charlemaine
and
vex
his
soul
with
hapless
memories
until
at
last
worn
out
by
thought
of
these
and
hopeless
striving
to
find
what
was
true
and
pondering
on
the
deeds
he
had
to
do
ere
he
returned
whereto
he
could
not
tell
sweet
sleep
upon
his
wearied
spirit
fell
and
on
the
afternoon
of
that
fair
day
forgetting
all
beneath
the
trees
he
lay
meanwhile
the
queen
affairs
of
state
being
done
went
through
the
gardens
with
one
dame
alone
seeking
for
ogier
whom
at
last
she
found
laid
sleeping
on
the
ground
dreaming
i
know
not
what
of
other
days
then
on
him
for
a
while
the
queen
did
gaze
drawing
sweet
poison
from
the
lovely
sight
then
to
her
fellow
turned
the
ancient
knight
what
means
he
by
this
word
of
his
she
said
he
were
well
mated
with
some
lovely
maid
just
pondering
on
the
name
of
love
softly
my
lady
he
begins
to
move
her
fellow
said
a
woman
old
and
grey
look
now
his
arms
are
of
another
day
none
know
him
or
his
deeds
thy
squire
just
said
he
asked
about
the
state
of
men
long
dead
i
fear
what
he
may
be
look
seest
thou
not
that
ring
that
on
one
finger
he
has
got
where
figures
strange
upon
the
gold
are
wrought
god
grant
that
he
from
hell
has
not
been
brought
for
our
confusion
in
this
doleful
war
who
surely
in
enough
of
trouble
are
without
such
help
then
the
queen
turned
aside
awhile
her
drawn
and
troubled
face
to
hide
for
lurking
dread
this
speech
within
her
stirred
but
yet
she
said
thou
sayest
a
foolish
word
this
man
is
come
against
our
enemies
to
fight
for
us
then
down
upon
her
knees
fell
the
old
woman
by
the
sleeping
knight
and
from
his
hand
she
drew
with
fingers
light
the
wondrous
ring
and
scarce
again
could
rise
ere
the
trembling
queen
bewildered
eyes
the
change
began
his
golden
hair
turned
white
his
smooth
cheek
wrinkled
and
his
breathing
light
was
turned
to
troublous
struggling
for
his
breath
and
on
his
shrunk
lips
lay
the
hand
of
death
and
scarce
less
pale
than
he
the
trembling
queen
stood
thinking
on
the
beauty
she
had
seen
and
longed
for
but
a
little
while
ago
yet
with
her
terror
still
her
love
did
grow
and
she
began
to
weep
as
though
she
saw
her
beauty
to
such
an
ending
draw
and
her
tears
waking
he
oped
his
eyes
and
strove
to
speak
but
nought
but
gasping
sighs
his
lips
could
utter
then
he
tried
to
reach
his
hand
to
them
as
though
he
would
beseech
the
gift
of
what
was
his
but
all
the
while
the
crone
gazed
on
them
with
an
evil
smile
then
holding
toward
the
queen
that
wondrous
ring
she
said
why
thou
having
this
fair
thing
thou
losing
nought
the
beauty
that
thou
hast
watch
the
vainly
struggling
world
go
past
thyself
unchanged
the
queen
put
forth
her
hand
and
took
the
ring
and
there
awhile
did
stand
and
strove
to
think
of
it
but
still
in
her
such
longings
love
did
stir
so
young
she
was
of
death
she
could
not
think
or
what
a
cup
eld
gives
to
man
to
drink
yet
on
her
finger
had
she
set
the
ring
when
now
the
life
that
hitherto
did
cling
to
ogier
heart
seemed
fading
quite
away
and
scarcely
breathing
with
shut
eyes
he
lay
then
kneeling
down
she
murmured
piteously
ah
wilt
thou
love
me
if
i
give
it
thee
and
thou
young
again
what
should
i
do
if
with
the
eyes
thou
thus
shalt
gain
anew
thou
shouldst
look
scorn
on
me
but
with
that
word
the
hedge
behind
her
by
the
west
wind
stirred
cast
fear
into
her
heart
of
some
one
nigh
and
therewith
on
his
finger
hastily
she
set
the
ring
then
rose
and
stood
apart
a
little
way
and
in
her
doubtful
heart
with
love
and
fear
was
mixed
desire
of
life
but
standing
so
a
look
with
great
scorn
rife
the
elder
woman
turning
cast
on
her
pointing
to
ogier
who
began
to
stir
she
looked
and
all
she
erst
saw
now
did
seem
to
have
been
nothing
but
a
hideous
dream
as
fair
and
young
he
rose
from
off
the
ground
and
cast
a
dazed
and
puzzled
look
around
like
one
just
waked
from
sleep
in
some
strange
place
but
soon
his
grave
eyes
rested
on
her
face
and
turned
yet
graver
seeing
her
so
pale
and
that
her
eyes
were
pregnant
with
some
tale
of
love
and
fear
she
his
eyes
the
while
forced
her
pale
lips
to
semblance
of
a
smile
and
said
o
ancient
knight
thou
sleepest
then
while
through
this
poor
land
range
the
heathen
men
unmet
of
any
but
my
king
and
lord
nay
let
us
see
the
deeds
of
thine
old
sword
queen
said
he
bid
me
then
unto
this
work
and
certes
i
behind
no
wall
would
lurk
nor
send
for
succour
while
a
scanty
folk
still
followed
after
me
to
break
the
yoke
i
pray
thee
grace
for
sleeping
and
were
fain
that
i
might
rather
never
sleep
again
then
have
such
wretched
dreams
as
i
now
have
waked
from
lovelier
she
seemed
to
grow
unto
him
as
he
spoke
fresh
colour
came
into
her
face
as
though
for
some
sweet
shame
while
she
with
tearful
eyes
beheld
him
so
that
somewhat
even
must
his
burnt
cheek
glow
his
heart
beat
faster
but
again
she
said
nay
will
dreams
burden
such
a
mighty
head
then
may
i
too
have
pardon
for
a
dream
last
night
in
sleep
i
saw
thee
who
didst
seem
to
be
the
king
of
france
and
thou
and
i
were
sitting
at
some
great
festivity
within
the
place
the
blush
of
shame
was
gone
as
on
his
face
she
gazed
and
saw
him
read
her
meaning
clear
and
knew
that
no
cold
words
she
had
to
fear
but
rather
that
for
softer
speech
he
yearned
therefore
with
love
alone
her
smooth
cheek
burned
her
parted
lips
were
hungry
for
his
kiss
she
trembled
at
the
near
approaching
bliss
nathless
she
checked
her
love
a
little
while
because
she
felt
the
old
dame
curious
smile
upon
her
and
she
said
o
ancient
knight
if
i
then
read
my
last
night
dream
aright
thou
art
come
here
our
very
help
to
be
perchance
to
give
my
husband
back
to
me
come
then
if
thou
this
land
art
fain
to
save
and
show
the
wisdom
thou
must
surely
have
unto
my
council
i
will
give
thee
then
what
charge
i
may
among
my
valiant
men
and
certes
thou
wilt
do
so
well
herein
that
ere
long
something
greater
shalt
thou
win
come
then
deliverer
of
my
throne
and
land
and
let
me
touch
for
once
thy
mighty
hand
with
these
weak
fingers
as
she
spoke
she
met
his
eager
hand
and
all
things
did
forget
but
for
one
moment
for
too
wise
were
they
to
cast
the
coming
years
of
joy
away
then
with
her
other
hand
her
gown
she
raised
and
led
him
thence
and
her
shoulder
gazed
at
her
old
follower
with
a
doubtful
smile
as
though
to
say
be
wise
i
know
thy
guile
but
slowly
she
behind
the
lovers
walked
muttering
so
be
it
thou
shalt
not
be
balked
of
thy
desire
be
merry
i
am
wise
nor
will
i
rob
thee
of
thy
paradise
for
any
other
than
myself
and
thou
even
happen
to
have
had
enow
of
this
new
love
before
i
get
the
ring
and
i
may
work
for
thee
no
evil
thing
now
ye
shall
know
that
the
old
chronicle
wherein
i
read
all
this
doth
duly
tell
of
all
the
gallant
deeds
that
ogier
did
there
may
ye
read
them
nor
let
me
be
chid
if
i
therefore
say
little
of
these
things
because
the
thought
of
avallon
still
clings
unto
my
heart
and
scarcely
can
i
bear
to
think
of
that
long
dragging
useless
year
through
which
with
dulled
and
glimmering
memory
ogier
was
grown
content
to
live
and
die
like
other
men
but
this
i
have
to
say
that
in
the
council
chamber
on
that
day
the
old
knight
showed
his
wisdom
well
enow
while
fainter
still
with
love
the
queen
did
grow
hearing
his
words
beholding
his
grey
eyes
flashing
with
fire
of
warlike
memories
yea
at
the
last
he
seemed
so
wise
indeed
that
she
could
give
him
now
the
charge
to
lead
one
wing
of
the
great
army
that
set
out
from
paris
gates
midst
many
a
wavering
shout
midst
trembling
prayers
and
unchecked
wails
and
tears
and
slender
hopes
and
unresisted
fears
now
ere
he
went
upon
his
bed
he
lay
newly
awakened
at
the
dawn
of
day
gathering
perplexéd
thoughts
of
many
a
thing
when
midst
the
carol
that
the
birds
did
sing
unto
the
coming
of
the
hopeful
sun
he
heard
a
sudden
lovesome
song
begun
two
young
voices
in
the
garden
green
that
seemed
indeed
the
farewell
of
the
queen
song
hæc
the
hawthorn
brake
be
merry
for
my
sake
the
blossoms
in
my
hair
me
where
i
am
most
fair
me
love
for
who
thing
cometh
after
death
ille
the
garlanded
gold
thee
where
thou
art
most
fair
the
hills
of
snow
sweet
love
i
have
thee
now
me
love
for
who
thing
cometh
after
death
hæc
we
weep
for
a
dead
day
set
sorrow
in
our
way
by
my
golden
hair
thou
weep
that
sweet
days
wear
me
love
for
who
thing
cometh
after
death
ille
o
love
the
days
that
flit
while
i
can
feel
thy
breath
may
i
remember
and
old
and
near
my
me
love
for
who
thing
cometh
after
death
soothed
by
the
pleasure
that
the
music
brought
and
sweet
desire
and
vague
and
dreamy
thought
of
happiness
it
seemed
to
promise
him
he
lay
and
listened
till
his
eyes
grew
dim
and
him
forgetfulness
to
creep
till
in
the
growing
light
he
lay
asleep
nor
woke
until
the
clanging
had
summoned
him
all
thought
away
to
cast
yet
one
more
joy
of
love
indeed
he
had
ere
with
the
battle
noise
he
was
made
glad
for
as
on
that
may
morning
forth
they
rode
and
passed
before
the
queen
most
fair
abode
there
at
a
window
was
she
waiting
them
in
fair
attire
with
gold
in
every
hem
and
as
the
ancient
knight
beneath
her
passed
a
wreath
of
flowering
down
she
cast
and
looked
farewell
to
him
and
forth
he
set
thinking
of
all
the
pleasure
he
should
get
from
love
and
war
forgetting
avallon
and
all
that
lovely
life
so
lightly
won
yea
now
indeed
the
earthly
life
ere
on
the
loadstone
rock
his
ship
was
cast
was
waxing
dim
nor
yet
at
all
he
learned
to
the
fire
that
erst
his
heart
had
burned
and
he
forgat
his
deeds
forgat
his
fame
forgat
the
letters
of
his
ancient
name
as
one
waked
fully
shall
forget
a
dream
that
once
to
him
a
wondrous
tale
did
seem
now
i
though
writing
here
no
chronicle
as
i
said
must
nathless
shortly
tell
that
ere
the
army
rouen
gates
could
gain
by
a
broad
arrow
had
the
king
been
slain
and
helpless
now
the
wretched
country
lay
beneath
the
yoke
until
the
glorious
day
when
ogier
fell
at
last
upon
the
foe
and
scattered
them
as
helplessly
as
though
they
had
been
beaten
men
without
a
name
so
when
to
paris
town
once
more
he
came
few
folk
the
memory
of
the
king
did
keep
within
their
hearts
and
if
the
folk
did
weep
at
his
returning
was
for
joy
indeed
that
such
a
man
had
risen
at
their
need
to
work
for
them
so
great
deliverance
and
loud
they
called
on
him
for
king
of
france
but
if
the
queen
heart
were
the
more
for
all
that
she
had
heard
of
his
great
fame
i
know
not
rather
with
some
hidden
dread
of
coming
fate
she
heard
her
lord
was
dead
and
her
false
dream
seemed
coming
true
at
last
for
the
clear
sky
of
love
seemed
overcast
with
clouds
of
god
great
judgments
and
the
fear
of
hate
and
final
parting
drawing
near
so
now
when
he
before
her
throne
did
stand
amidst
the
throng
as
saviour
of
the
land
and
she
her
eyes
to
his
kind
eyes
did
raise
and
there
before
all
her
own
love
must
praise
then
did
she
fall
and
folk
said
see
how
she
sorrows
for
the
newly
dead
amidst
our
joy
she
needs
must
think
of
him
let
be
full
surely
shall
her
grief
wax
dim
and
she
shall
wed
again
so
passed
the
year
while
ogier
set
himself
the
land
to
clear
of
broken
remnants
of
the
heathen
men
and
at
the
last
when
came
again
must
he
be
crowned
king
of
the
land
and
at
the
altar
take
the
fair
queen
hand
and
wed
her
for
his
own
and
now
by
this
had
he
forgotten
clean
the
woe
and
bliss
of
his
old
life
and
still
was
he
made
glad
as
other
men
and
hopes
and
fears
he
had
as
others
and
bethought
him
not
at
all
of
what
strange
days
upon
him
yet
should
fall
when
he
should
live
and
these
again
be
dead
now
drew
the
time
round
when
he
should
be
wed
and
in
his
palace
on
his
bed
he
lay
upon
the
dawning
of
the
very
day
sleep
and
waking
was
he
and
could
hear
at
that
hour
through
the
bright
morn
and
clear
the
hammering
of
the
folk
who
toiled
to
make
some
stages
for
the
pageant
sake
though
hardly
yet
the
sparrows
had
begun
to
twitter
the
coming
of
the
sun
nor
through
the
palace
did
a
creature
move
there
in
the
sweet
entanglement
of
love
midst
languid
thoughts
of
greater
bliss
he
lay
remembering
no
more
of
that
other
day
than
the
hot
noon
remembereth
of
the
night
than
summer
thinketh
of
the
winter
white
in
that
sweet
hour
he
heard
a
voice
that
cried
ogier
ogier
then
opening
his
eyes
wide
and
rising
on
his
elbow
gazed
around
and
strange
to
him
and
empty
was
the
sound
of
his
own
name
whom
callest
thou
he
said
for
i
the
man
who
lie
upon
this
bed
am
charles
of
france
and
shall
be
king
but
in
a
year
that
now
is
passed
away
the
ancient
knight
they
called
me
who
is
this
thou
callest
ogier
then
what
deeds
are
his
and
who
art
thou
but
at
that
word
a
sigh
as
of
one
grieved
came
from
some
place
anigh
his
and
a
soft
voice
spake
again
this
ogier
once
was
great
amongst
great
men
to
italy
a
helpless
hostage
led
he
saved
the
king
when
the
false
lombard
fled
bore
forth
the
oriflamme
and
gained
the
day
charlot
he
brought
back
whom
men
led
away
and
fought
a
fight
with
caraheu
the
ravager
of
rome
his
right
hand
slew
nor
did
he
fear
the
might
of
charlemaine
who
for
a
dreary
year
beset
in
vain
his
lonely
castle
yet
at
last
caught
then
and
shut
in
hold
needs
must
he
come
again
to
give
an
unhoped
great
deliverance
unto
the
burdened
helpless
land
of
france
denmark
he
gained
thereafter
and
he
wore
the
crown
of
england
drawn
from
trouble
sore
at
tyre
then
he
reigned
and
babylon
with
mighty
deeds
he
from
the
foemen
won
and
when
scarce
aught
could
give
him
greater
fame
he
left
the
world
still
thinking
on
his
name
these
things
did
ogier
and
these
things
didst
thou
nor
will
i
call
thee
by
a
new
name
now
since
i
have
spoken
words
of
love
to
thee
ogier
ogier
dost
thou
remember
me
if
thou
hast
no
thought
of
that
past
time
before
thou
camest
to
our
happy
clime
as
this
was
said
his
mazed
eyes
saw
indeed
a
lovely
woman
clad
in
dainty
weed
beside
his
bed
and
many
a
thought
was
stirred
within
his
heart
by
that
last
plaintive
word
though
nought
he
said
but
waited
what
should
come
love
said
she
i
am
here
to
bring
thee
home
well
hast
thou
done
all
that
thou
to
do
and
if
thou
bidest
here
for
something
new
will
folk
begin
to
cry
and
all
thy
fame
shall
then
avail
thee
but
for
greater
blame
thy
love
shall
cease
to
love
thee
and
the
earth
thou
lovest
now
shall
be
of
little
worth
while
still
thou
keepest
life
abhorring
it
behold
in
men
lives
that
so
quickly
flit
thus
is
it
how
then
shall
it
be
with
thee
who
some
faint
image
of
eternity
hast
gained
through
me
alas
thou
heedest
not
on
all
these
changing
things
thine
heart
is
hot
take
then
this
gift
that
i
have
brought
from
far
and
then
thou
remember
what
we
are
the
lover
and
the
loved
from
long
ago
he
trembled
and
more
memory
seemed
to
grow
within
his
heart
as
he
beheld
her
stand
holding
a
glittering
crown
in
her
right
hand
ogier
she
said
arise
and
do
on
thee
the
emblems
of
thy
worldly
sovereignty
for
we
must
pass
many
a
sea
this
morn
he
rose
and
in
the
glittering
tunic
worn
by
charlemaine
he
clad
himself
and
took
the
ivory
hand
that
charlemaine
once
shook
over
the
people
heads
in
days
of
old
then
on
his
feet
he
set
the
shoes
of
gold
and
his
shoulders
threw
the
mantle
fair
and
set
the
gold
crown
on
his
golden
hair
then
on
the
royal
chair
he
sat
him
down
as
though
he
deemed
the
elders
of
the
town
should
come
to
audience
and
in
all
he
seemed
to
do
these
things
as
a
man
who
dreamed
and
now
adown
the
seine
the
golden
sun
shone
out
as
toward
him
drew
that
lovely
one
and
took
from
off
his
head
the
royal
crown
and
smiling
on
the
pillow
laid
it
down
and
said
lie
there
o
crown
of
charlemaine
worn
by
a
mighty
man
and
worn
in
vain
because
he
died
and
all
the
things
he
did
were
changed
before
his
face
by
earth
was
hid
a
better
crown
i
have
for
my
love
head
whereby
he
yet
shall
live
when
all
are
dead
his
hand
has
helped
then
on
his
head
she
set
the
wondrous
crown
and
said
forget
forget
forget
these
weary
things
for
thou
hast
much
of
happiness
to
think
of
at
that
touch
he
rose
a
happy
light
gleamed
in
his
eyes
and
smitten
by
the
rush
of
memories
he
stammered
out
o
love
how
came
we
here
what
do
we
in
this
land
of
death
and
fear
have
i
not
been
from
thee
a
weary
while
let
us
return
i
dreamed
about
the
isle
i
dreamed
of
other
years
of
strife
and
pain
of
new
years
full
of
struggles
long
and
vain
she
took
him
by
the
hand
and
said
come
love
i
am
not
changed
and
therewith
did
they
move
unto
the
door
and
through
the
sleeping
place
swiftly
they
went
and
still
was
ogier
face
turned
on
her
beauty
and
no
thought
was
his
except
the
dear
returning
of
his
bliss
but
at
the
threshold
of
the
that
opened
to
them
she
awhile
did
wait
and
turned
her
eyes
unto
the
rippling
seine
and
said
o
love
behold
it
once
again
he
turned
and
gazed
upon
the
city
grey
smit
by
the
gold
of
that
sweet
morn
of
may
he
heard
faint
noises
as
of
wakening
folk
as
on
their
heads
his
day
of
glory
broke
he
heard
the
changing
rush
of
the
swift
stream
against
the
all
was
grown
a
dream
his
work
was
over
his
reward
was
come
why
should
he
loiter
longer
from
his
home
a
little
while
she
watched
him
silently
then
beckoned
him
to
follow
with
a
sigh
and
raising
up
the
raiment
from
her
feet
across
the
threshold
stepped
into
the
street
one
moment
on
the
twain
the
low
sun
shone
and
then
the
place
was
void
and
they
were
gone
how
i
know
not
but
this
i
know
indeed
that
in
whatso
great
trouble
or
sore
need
the
land
of
france
since
that
fair
day
has
been
no
more
the
sword
of
ogier
has
she
seen
such
was
the
tale
he
told
of
avallon
such
an
one
as
in
days
past
had
won
his
youthful
heart
to
think
upon
the
quest
but
to
those
old
hearts
nigh
in
reach
of
rest
not
much
to
be
desired
now
it
seemed
perchance
the
heart
that
of
such
things
had
dreamed
had
found
no
words
in
this
tongue
we
speak
on
earth
wherewith
they
might
be
sung
perchance
the
changing
years
that
changed
his
heart
in
the
words
of
that
old
tale
had
part
changing
its
sweet
to
bitter
to
despair
the
foolish
hope
that
once
had
glittered
there
or
think
that
in
some
bay
of
that
far
home
they
then
had
sat
and
watched
the
green
waves
come
up
to
their
feet
with
many
promises
or
the
light
wind
midst
trees
in
the
sweet
spring
had
weighted
many
a
word
of
no
worth
now
and
many
a
hope
had
stirred
long
dead
for
ever
that
be
among
strange
folk
they
now
sat
quietly
as
though
that
tale
with
them
had
nought
to
do
as
though
its
hopes
and
fears
were
something
new
but
though
indeed
the
outworn
dwindled
band
had
no
tears
left
for
that
once
land
the
very
wind
must
moan
for
their
decay
and
from
the
sky
grown
dull
and
low
and
grey
cold
tears
must
fall
upon
the
lonely
field
that
such
fair
golden
hopes
erewhile
did
yield
and
on
the
blackening
woods
wherein
the
doves
sat
silent
now
forgetful
of
their
loves
yet
since
a
little
life
at
least
was
left
they
were
not
yet
of
every
joy
bereft
for
long
ago
was
past
the
agony
midst
which
they
found
that
they
indeed
must
die
and
now
as
much
their
pain
was
past
as
though
death
veil
already
had
been
cast
over
their
heads
so
midst
some
little
mirth
they
watched
the
dark
night
hide
the
gloomy
earth
