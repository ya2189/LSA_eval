at
the
library
of
congress
washington
rights
to
my
wife
i
down
bye
street
in
a
little
shropshire
town
there
lived
a
widow
with
her
only
son
she
had
no
wealth
nor
title
to
renown
nor
any
joyous
hours
never
one
she
rose
from
ragged
mattress
before
sun
and
stitched
all
day
until
her
eyes
were
red
and
had
to
stitch
because
her
man
was
dead
sometimes
she
fell
asleep
she
stitched
so
hard
letting
the
linen
fall
upon
the
floor
and
hungry
cats
would
steal
in
from
the
yard
and
mangy
chickens
pecked
about
the
door
craning
their
necks
so
ragged
and
so
sore
to
search
the
room
for
or
for
mouse
but
they
got
nothing
in
the
house
mostly
she
made
her
bread
by
hemming
shrouds
for
one
rich
undertaker
in
the
high
street
who
used
to
pray
that
folks
might
die
in
crowds
and
that
their
friends
might
pay
to
let
them
lie
sweet
and
when
one
died
the
widow
in
the
bye
street
stitched
night
and
day
to
give
the
worm
his
dole
the
dead
were
better
dressed
than
that
poor
soul
her
little
son
was
all
her
delight
for
in
his
little
features
she
could
find
a
glimpse
of
that
dead
husband
out
of
sight
where
out
of
sight
is
never
out
of
mind
and
so
she
stitched
till
she
was
nearly
blind
or
till
the
tallow
candle
end
was
done
to
get
a
living
for
her
little
son
her
love
for
him
being
such
she
would
not
rest
it
was
a
want
which
ate
her
out
and
in
another
hunger
in
her
withered
breast
pressing
her
bones
against
the
skin
to
make
him
plump
she
starved
her
body
thin
and
he
he
ate
the
food
and
never
knew
he
laughed
and
played
as
little
children
do
when
there
was
little
sickness
in
the
place
she
took
what
god
would
send
and
what
god
sent
never
brought
any
colour
to
her
face
nor
life
into
her
footsteps
when
she
went
going
she
trembled
always
withered
and
bent
for
all
went
to
her
son
always
the
same
he
was
first
served
whatever
blessing
came
sometimes
she
wandered
out
to
gather
sticks
for
it
was
bitter
cold
there
when
it
snowed
and
she
stole
hay
out
of
the
ricks
for
bands
to
wrap
her
feet
in
while
she
sewed
and
when
her
feet
were
warm
and
the
grate
glowed
she
hugged
her
little
son
her
desire
with
it
snug
beside
the
fire
so
years
went
on
till
jimmy
was
a
lad
and
went
to
work
as
poor
lads
have
to
do
and
then
the
loving
heart
was
glad
to
know
that
all
the
pains
she
had
gone
through
and
all
the
years
of
putting
on
the
screw
down
to
the
sharpest
turn
a
mortal
can
had
borne
their
fruit
and
made
her
child
a
man
he
got
a
job
at
working
on
the
line
tipping
the
earth
down
trolly
after
truck
from
daylight
till
the
evening
wet
or
fine
with
arms
all
red
from
wallowing
in
the
muck
and
spitting
as
the
trolly
tipped
for
luck
and
singing
as
he
swung
the
pick
because
the
red
blood
ran
in
him
so
quick
so
there
was
bacon
then
at
night
for
supper
in
bye
street
there
where
he
and
mother
stay
and
boots
they
had
not
leaky
in
the
upper
and
room
rent
ready
on
the
settling
day
and
beer
for
poor
old
mother
worn
and
grey
and
fire
in
frost
and
in
the
eyes
it
seemed
the
lord
had
made
earth
paradise
and
there
they
sat
of
evenings
after
dark
singing
their
song
of
he
and
she
her
poor
old
cackle
made
the
mongrels
bark
and
sing
binger
mother
carols
he
crimes
but
a
good
song
that
her
and
then
they
slept
there
in
the
room
they
shared
and
all
the
time
fate
had
his
end
prepared
one
thing
alone
made
life
not
perfect
sweet
the
daily
fear
of
what
would
come
when
woman
and
her
lovely
boy
should
meet
when
the
new
wife
would
break
up
the
old
home
fear
of
that
unborn
evil
struck
her
dumb
and
when
her
darling
and
a
woman
met
she
shook
and
prayed
her
o
god
not
yet
dear
god
my
jimmy
go
from
then
she
would
subtly
question
with
her
son
very
handsome
i
think
her
be
help
the
man
who
marries
such
an
her
red
eyes
peered
to
spy
the
mischief
done
she
took
great
care
to
keep
the
girls
away
and
all
her
trouble
made
him
easier
prey
there
was
a
woman
out
at
end
light
of
her
body
fifty
to
the
pound
a
copper
coin
for
any
man
to
spend
lovely
to
look
on
when
the
wits
were
drowned
her
skeleton
was
never
found
it
lay
among
the
rocks
at
glydyr
mor
where
he
drank
poison
finding
her
a
whore
she
was
not
native
there
for
she
belonged
out
milford
way
or
swansea
no
one
knew
she
had
the
piteous
look
of
someone
wronged
her
name
a
widow
last
of
triw
she
had
lived
at
end
a
year
or
two
at
cottage
renting
half
an
acre
she
was
a
and
a
secret
she
was
she
lived
in
reputation
but
secret
unseen
threads
went
floating
out
her
smile
her
voice
her
face
were
all
temptation
all
subtle
flies
to
trouble
man
the
trout
man
to
entice
entrap
entangle
flout
to
take
and
spoil
and
then
to
cast
aside
gain
without
giving
was
the
craft
she
plied
and
she
complained
poor
lonely
widowed
soul
how
no
one
cared
and
men
were
rutters
all
while
true
love
is
an
goal
burning
the
brighter
as
the
shadows
fall
and
all
dogs
went
hunting
at
the
call
married
or
not
she
took
them
by
the
brain
sucked
at
their
hearts
and
tossed
them
back
again
like
the
straw
fires
lit
on
saint
eve
she
burned
and
dwindled
in
her
fickle
heart
for
if
she
wept
when
harry
took
his
leave
her
tears
were
lures
to
beckon
bob
to
start
and
if
while
loving
bob
a
cart
came
by
she
opened
window
with
a
smile
and
gave
the
tinker
hints
to
wait
a
while
she
passed
for
pure
but
years
before
in
wales
living
at
mountain
ash
with
different
men
her
less
discretion
had
inspired
tales
of
certain
things
she
did
and
how
and
when
those
seven
years
of
youth
we
are
frantic
then
she
had
been
frantic
in
her
years
of
youth
the
tales
were
not
more
evil
than
the
truth
she
had
two
children
as
the
fruits
of
trade
though
she
drank
bitter
herbs
to
kill
the
curse
both
of
them
sons
and
one
she
overlaid
the
other
one
the
parish
had
to
nurse
now
she
grew
plump
with
money
in
her
purse
passing
for
pure
a
hundred
miles
i
guess
from
where
her
little
son
wore
workhouse
dress
there
with
the
union
boys
he
came
and
went
a
parish
bastard
fed
on
bread
and
tea
wearing
a
bright
tin
badge
in
furthest
gwent
and
no
one
knowing
who
his
folk
could
be
his
mother
never
knew
his
new
name
she
she
touched
the
lust
of
those
who
served
her
turn
and
chief
among
her
men
was
shepherd
ern
a
moody
treacherous
man
of
bawdy
mind
married
to
that
mild
girl
from
ercall
hill
whose
gentle
goodness
made
him
more
inclined
to
hotter
sauces
sharper
on
the
bill
the
new
lust
gives
the
lecher
the
new
thrill
the
new
wine
scratches
as
it
slips
the
throat
the
new
flag
is
so
bright
by
the
old
boat
ern
was
her
man
to
buy
her
bread
and
meat
half
of
his
weekly
wage
was
hers
to
spend
she
used
to
mock
is
your
wife
my
sweet
or
wail
ernie
how
is
this
to
end
or
coo
ernie
is
without
a
friend
she
can
not
understand
my
precious
life
and
ernie
would
go
home
and
beat
his
wife
so
the
four
souls
are
ranged
the
set
the
dark
invisible
hand
of
secret
fate
brought
it
to
come
to
being
that
they
met
after
so
many
years
of
lying
in
wait
while
we
least
think
it
he
prepares
his
mate
mate
and
the
pawn
played
it
never
ceases
though
all
the
earth
is
dust
of
taken
pieces
ii
october
is
the
time
for
fun
for
all
the
street
is
hurdled
into
rows
of
pens
of
heifers
blinking
at
the
sun
and
lemster
sheep
which
pant
and
seem
to
doze
and
stalls
of
hardbake
and
galanty
shows
and
cheapjacks
smashing
crocks
and
trumpets
blowing
and
the
loud
organ
of
the
horses
going
there
you
can
buy
blue
ribbons
for
your
girl
or
take
her
in
a
tossing
high
or
hold
her
fast
when
all
the
horses
whirl
round
to
the
steam
pipe
whanging
at
the
sky
or
stand
her
cockshies
at
the
or
buy
her
brooches
with
her
name
in
red
or
queen
victoria
done
in
gingerbread
then
there
are
rifle
shots
at
tossing
balls
if
you
hit
you
get
a
good
and
for
lads
to
lamm
with
mauls
and
cheshire
cheeses
on
a
greasy
spar
the
country
folk
flock
in
from
near
and
far
women
and
men
like
to
the
roast
all
love
the
fair
but
anna
loved
it
most
anna
was
all
agog
to
see
the
fair
she
made
ern
promise
to
be
there
to
meet
her
to
arm
her
round
to
all
the
pleasures
there
and
buy
her
ribbons
for
her
neck
and
treat
her
so
that
no
woman
at
the
fair
should
beat
her
in
having
pleasure
at
a
expense
she
planned
to
meet
him
at
the
chapel
fence
so
ernie
went
and
jimmy
took
his
mother
dressed
in
her
finest
with
a
monmouth
shawl
and
there
was
such
a
crowd
she
thought
smother
and
o
she
loved
a
above
all
clash
go
the
crockeries
where
the
cheapjacks
bawl
baa
go
the
sheep
thud
goes
the
drum
and
ernie
cursed
for
anna
come
he
hunted
for
her
up
and
down
the
place
raging
and
snapping
like
a
working
brew
with
someone
else
smash
his
face
and
when
done
for
him
go
for
he
bought
no
fairings
as
vowed
to
do
for
his
poor
little
children
back
at
home
stuck
at
the
glass
see
till
father
not
finding
her
he
went
into
an
inn
busy
with
ringing
till
and
scratching
matches
where
thirsty
drovers
mingled
stout
with
gin
and
three
or
four
welsh
herds
were
singing
catches
the
clattered
letting
in
in
snatches
the
noises
of
the
fair
now
low
now
loud
ern
called
for
beer
and
glowered
at
the
crowd
while
he
was
glowering
at
his
drinking
there
in
came
the
gipsy
bessie
hawking
toys
a
strapping
harlot
with
black
hair
one
of
the
tribe
which
camped
at
bois
she
lured
him
out
of
inn
into
the
noise
of
the
where
the
horses
spun
and
so
the
end
of
all
things
was
begun
newness
in
lust
always
the
old
in
love
up
your
toys
he
said
come
along
have
a
turn
of
up
above
and
see
the
murder
when
they
strike
the
she
giggled
but
you
strong
and
your
proper
girl
you
know
then
i
will
said
he
anna
was
late
because
the
cart
which
drove
her
called
for
her
late
the
horse
had
broke
a
trace
she
was
all
dressed
and
scented
for
her
lover
her
bright
blue
blouse
had
imitation
lace
the
paint
was
red
as
roses
on
her
face
she
hummed
a
song
because
she
thought
to
see
how
envious
all
the
other
girls
would
be
when
she
arrived
and
found
her
ernie
gone
her
bitter
heart
thought
is
how
it
is
keeping
me
waiting
while
the
sports
are
on
promising
faithful
too
and
then
to
miss
o
ernie
i
give
it
you
for
and
looking
up
she
saw
a
couple
cling
ern
with
his
arm
round
bessie
in
the
swing
ern
caught
her
eye
and
spat
and
cut
her
dead
bessie
laughed
hardly
in
the
gipsy
way
anna
though
blind
with
fury
tossed
her
head
biting
her
lips
until
the
red
was
grey
for
bitter
moments
given
bitter
pay
the
time
for
payment
comes
early
or
late
no
earthly
debtor
but
accounts
to
fate
she
turned
aside
telling
with
bitter
oaths
what
ern
should
suffer
if
he
turned
agen
and
there
was
jimmy
stripping
off
his
clothes
within
a
little
ring
of
farming
men
jimmy
put
the
old
tup
into
his
mother
watching
thought
her
heart
would
curdle
to
see
jim
drag
the
old
ram
to
the
hurdle
then
the
ram
butted
and
the
game
began
till
muscles
cracked
and
the
ram
grunted
the
good
old
wrestling
game
of
ram
and
man
at
which
none
knows
the
hunter
from
the
hunted
and
see
jimmy
have
his
belly
tup
good
jim
good
jimmy
sick
him
rover
by
dang
but
got
him
fairly
then
there
was
clap
of
hands
and
jimmy
grinned
and
took
five
silver
shillings
from
his
backers
and
said
tup
had
put
him
out
of
wind
or
else
take
all
comers
at
the
whackers
and
some
made
rude
remarks
of
rams
and
knackers
and
mother
shook
to
get
her
son
alone
to
be
sure
he
broke
a
bone
none
but
the
lucky
man
deserves
the
fair
for
lucky
men
have
money
and
success
things
that
a
whore
is
very
glad
to
share
or
dip
at
least
a
finger
in
the
mess
anne
with
her
raddled
cheeks
and
sunday
dress
smiled
upon
jimmy
seeing
him
succeed
as
though
to
say
are
a
man
all
the
great
things
of
life
are
swiftly
done
creation
death
and
love
the
double
gate
however
much
we
dawdle
in
the
sun
we
have
to
hurry
at
the
touch
of
fate
when
life
knocks
at
the
door
no
one
can
wait
when
death
makes
his
arrest
we
have
to
go
and
so
with
love
and
jimmy
found
it
so
love
the
sharp
spear
went
pricking
to
the
bone
in
that
one
look
desire
and
bitter
aching
longing
to
have
that
woman
all
alone
for
her
dear
sake
all
else
forsaking
and
sudden
agony
that
set
him
shaking
lest
she
whose
beauty
made
his
blood
cruddle
should
be
another
to
kiss
and
cuddle
she
was
beside
him
when
he
left
the
ring
her
soft
dress
brushed
against
him
as
he
passed
her
he
thought
her
penny
scent
a
sweeter
thing
than
precious
ointment
out
of
alabaster
love
the
mild
servant
makes
a
drunken
master
she
smiled
half
sadly
out
of
thoughtful
eyes
and
all
the
strong
young
man
was
easy
prize
she
spoke
to
take
him
seeing
him
a
sheep
beautiful
you
wrastled
with
the
ram
it
made
me
all
go
tremble
just
to
peep
i
am
that
fond
of
wrastling
that
i
am
why
your
mother
too
i
was
just
telling
jim
how
well
he
done
how
proud
you
must
be
of
so
fine
a
old
mother
blinked
while
jimmy
hardly
knew
whether
he
knew
the
woman
there
or
not
but
well
he
knew
if
not
he
wanted
to
joy
of
her
beauty
ran
in
him
so
hot
old
trembling
mother
by
him
was
forgot
while
anna
searched
the
face
to
know
whether
she
took
her
for
a
whore
or
no
the
maxim
the
woman
first
made
her
be
gracious
to
the
withered
thing
being
in
crowds
do
give
one
such
a
thirst
i
wonder
if
tea
going
at
the
king
my
that
dry
my
very
tongue
do
cling
perhaps
take
my
arm
wander
up
if
agree
and
try
and
get
a
cup
come
a
cup
of
tea
would
do
you
good
nothing
like
a
nice
hot
cup
of
tea
after
the
crowd
and
all
the
time
stood
and
the
strict
it
like
the
key
now
take
my
arm
my
dear
and
lean
on
and
mother
being
nearly
blind
took
arm
and
only
thought
her
kind
so
off
they
set
with
anna
talking
to
her
how
nice
the
tea
would
be
after
the
crowd
and
mother
thinking
half
the
time
she
knew
her
and
blood
ticking
quick
and
loud
and
death
beside
him
knitting
at
his
shroud
and
all
the
high
street
babbling
with
the
fair
and
white
october
clouds
in
the
blue
air
so
tea
was
made
and
down
they
sat
to
drink
o
the
pale
beauty
sitting
at
the
board
there
is
more
death
in
women
than
we
think
there
is
much
danger
in
the
soul
adored
the
white
hands
bring
the
poison
and
the
cord
death
has
a
lodge
in
lips
as
red
as
cherries
death
has
a
mansion
in
the
berries
they
sat
there
talking
after
tea
was
done
and
jimmy
blushed
at
sparkling
looks
and
anna
flattered
mother
on
her
son
catching
both
fishes
on
her
subtle
hooks
with
twilight
tea
and
talk
in
and
music
coming
up
from
the
dim
street
mother
had
never
known
a
fair
so
sweet
now
clink
for
is
come
the
drovers
stack
the
hurdles
into
carts
new
masters
drive
the
straying
cattle
home
many
a
young
calf
from
his
mother
parts
hogs
straggle
back
to
sty
by
fits
and
starts
the
farmers
take
a
last
glass
at
the
inns
and
now
the
frolic
of
the
fair
begins
all
of
the
side
shows
of
the
fair
are
lighted
flares
and
bright
lights
and
brassy
cymbals
clanging
and
invited
shatter
the
pauses
of
the
whanging
the
oldest
show
on
earth
and
the
last
hanging
murder
in
the
red
barn
with
real
blood
the
rifles
crack
the
sally
thud
anna
walked
slowly
homewards
with
her
prey
holding
old
tottering
weight
upon
her
and
pouring
in
sweet
poison
on
the
way
of
a
pleasure
and
such
an
honour
and
so
safe
with
such
a
son
to
con
her
through
all
the
noises
and
through
all
the
press
boys
squirt
tormenters
on
her
at
door
they
stop
to
say
and
mother
must
go
in
to
set
the
table
anna
pretended
that
she
felt
a
fright
to
go
alone
through
all
the
merry
babel
friends
are
waiting
at
the
cain
and
abel
just
down
the
other
side
of
market
square
be
a
mercy
if
set
me
so
jimmy
came
while
mother
went
inside
anna
has
got
her
victim
in
her
clutch
jimmy
all
blushing
glad
to
be
her
guide
thrilled
by
her
scent
and
trembling
at
her
touch
she
was
all
white
and
dark
and
said
not
much
she
sighed
to
hint
that
grave
was
dug
and
smiled
within
to
see
him
such
a
mug
they
passed
the
house
among
the
trees
she
sighed
so
deep
that
jimmy
asked
her
why
too
unhappy
upon
nights
like
these
when
everyone
has
happiness
but
i
you
happy
she
appeared
to
cry
blinked
with
her
eyes
and
turned
away
her
head
much
but
some
men
understand
she
said
her
voice
caught
lightly
on
a
broken
note
jimmy
but
dared
not
touch
her
hand
yet
all
his
blood
went
pumping
in
his
throat
beside
the
beauty
he
could
understand
and
death
stopped
knitting
at
the
muffling
band
shroud
is
done
he
muttered
to
he
snapped
the
ends
and
tucked
his
needles
in
jimmy
half
stammering
choked
any
man
he
stopped
she
shook
her
head
to
answer
tell
some
day
if
i
can
it
hurts
to
talk
of
some
things
ever
so
but
so
different
there
come
we
must
go
none
but
unhappy
women
know
how
good
it
is
to
meet
a
soul
wait
a
moment
may
i
call
you
anna
there
must
be
nearness
us
love
in
her
face
hung
out
his
bloody
banner
and
all
clanging
trumpets
shocked
and
blew
we
got
up
we
never
sure
i
think
nor
you
now
this
come
to
us
for
anna
take
my
arm
that
must
come
later
when
we
know
our
minds
we
must
agree
to
keep
this
evening
white
eat
the
fruit
and
save
the
and
all
the
folk
whose
shadows
darked
the
blinds
and
all
the
dancers
whirling
in
the
fair
were
wretched
worms
to
jim
and
anna
there
wonderful
life
is
said
anna
lowly
it
begins
again
with
you
for
in
the
dim
lamplight
jimmy
thought
her
holy
a
lovely
fragile
thing
for
him
to
tend
grace
beyond
measure
beauty
without
end
he
said
this
is
the
door
i
never
knew
what
people
meant
my
friend
o
my
sweet
the
quite
early
yet
say
come
just
another
short
turn
down
the
street
the
whole
bubbling
up
for
you
and
i
somehow
i
feel
we
may
die
come
just
as
far
as
to
the
but
said
anna
all
the
tides
triumph
when
the
white
moon
fills
down
in
the
race
the
toppling
waters
shout
the
breakers
shake
the
bases
of
the
hills
there
is
a
thundering
where
the
streams
go
out
and
the
wise
shipman
puts
his
ship
about
seeing
the
gathering
of
those
waters
wan
but
what
when
love
makes
high
tide
in
a
man
jimmy
walked
home
with
all
his
mind
on
fire
one
lovely
face
for
ever
set
in
flame
he
shivered
as
he
went
like
tautened
wire
surge
after
surge
of
shuddering
in
him
came
and
then
swept
out
repeating
one
sweet
name
o
anna
to
the
evening
star
anna
was
sipping
whiskey
in
the
bar
so
back
to
home
and
mother
jimmy
wandered
thinking
of
end
and
lips
he
ate
no
supper
worth
the
name
but
pondered
on
end
hedge
scarlet
with
ripe
hips
and
of
the
lovely
moon
there
in
eclipse
and
how
she
must
be
shining
in
the
house
behind
the
hedge
of
those
old
boughs
old
mother
cleared
away
the
clock
struck
eight
boy
left
your
bacon
lawks
a
me
so
what
comes
of
having
tea
so
late
another
time
go
without
your
tea
your
father
liked
his
cup
too
he
always
another
cup
he
used
to
say
he
never
went
without
on
any
day
how
nice
the
lady
was
and
how
she
talked
never
had
a
nicer
fair
not
said
like
to
see
us
if
we
walked
to
end
beyond
by
watersever
woman
too
and
that
and
clever
we
might
go
round
one
evening
we
two
or
i
might
go
if
too
far
for
said
the
mother
not
folk
for
that
meet
at
the
fair
and
that
and
there
an
end
rake
out
the
fire
and
put
out
the
cat
these
fairs
are
sinful
tempting
folk
to
spend
of
course
she
spoke
polite
and
like
a
friend
of
course
she
had
to
do
and
so
i
let
her
but
now
done
and
past
so
i
forget
see
why
forget
her
why
forget
her
she
treat
us
kind
she
like
everyone
i
never
saw
a
woman
i
liked
better
and
not
easy
pleased
my
son
so
go
round
some
night
when
work
is
jim
my
dear
trust
mother
a
so
i
do
but
sometimes
so
she
blinked
at
him
out
of
her
withered
eyes
below
her
lashless
eyelids
red
and
bleared
her
months
of
sacrifice
had
won
the
prize
her
jim
had
come
to
what
she
always
feared
and
yet
she
doubted
so
she
shook
and
peered
and
begged
her
god
not
let
a
woman
take
the
lovely
son
whom
she
had
starved
to
make
doubting
she
stood
the
dishes
in
the
rack
ask
her
in
some
evening
then
she
said
nice
her
hair
looked
in
the
bit
of
and
still
she
peered
from
eyes
all
dim
and
red
to
note
at
once
if
jimmy
drooped
his
head
or
if
his
ears
blushed
when
he
heard
her
praised
and
jimmy
blushed
and
hung
his
head
and
gazed
is
the
end
she
thought
is
the
end
have
to
sew
again
for
mr
jones
do
hems
when
i
can
hardly
see
to
mend
and
have
the
old
ache
in
my
and
when
his
in
when
she
groans
send
for
me
until
the
pains
have
ceased
and
give
me
leavings
at
the
christening
feast
and
sit
aslant
to
eye
me
as
i
eat
only
wanted
here
for
just
for
the
party
for
the
treat
ever
think
i
mean
to
let
you
stay
company
none
what
i
say
life
can
be
bitter
to
the
very
bone
when
one
is
poor
and
woman
and
alone
she
said
still
doubting
my
dear
have
our
binger
we
go
to
bed
and
then
dog
she
cackled
clear
over
stile
she
sang
nodding
her
head
name
was
little
she
said
now
jimmy
kicked
the
hob
the
sacrament
of
song
died
in
a
sob
jimmy
went
out
into
the
night
to
think
under
the
moon
so
steady
in
the
blue
the
beauty
ran
in
him
like
drink
the
fear
that
men
had
loved
her
burnt
him
through
the
fear
that
even
then
another
knew
all
the
deep
mystery
which
women
make
to
hide
the
inner
nothing
made
him
shake
i
love
you
and
i
always
he
looked
towards
end
beyond
cot
hills
a
white
star
glimmered
in
the
long
canal
a
droning
from
the
music
came
in
thrills
love
is
a
flame
to
burn
out
human
wills
love
is
a
flame
to
set
the
will
on
fire
love
is
a
flame
to
cheat
men
into
mire
one
of
the
three
we
make
love
what
we
choose
but
jimmy
did
not
know
he
only
thought
that
anna
was
too
beautiful
to
lose
that
she
was
all
the
world
and
he
was
naught
that
it
was
sweet
though
bitter
to
be
caught
i
love
underneath
the
moon
shall
go
mad
unless
i
see
you
the
lights
threw
aloft
a
misty
glow
the
organ
whangs
the
giddy
horses
reel
the
rifles
cease
the
folk
begin
to
go
the
hands
unclamp
the
from
the
wheel
there
is
a
smell
of
trodden
orange
peel
the
organ
drones
and
dies
the
horses
stop
and
then
the
tent
collapses
from
the
top
the
fair
is
over
let
the
people
troop
the
drunkards
stagger
homewards
down
the
gutters
the
showmen
heave
in
an
excited
group
the
poles
tilt
slowly
down
the
canvas
flutters
the
mauls
knock
out
the
pins
the
last
flare
sputters
dang
near
knock
my
skull
in
loose
it
in
the
the
loaded
right
to
the
cushion
gone
the
red
one
for
the
queen
think
i
stowed
think
you
think
lord
that
cushion
john
in
that
bloody
box
sitting
on
what
more
want
a
concertina
plays
far
off
as
wandering
lovers
go
their
ways
up
the
dim
bye
street
to
the
the
dead
bones
of
the
fair
are
borne
in
carts
horses
and
at
a
funeral
pace
after
triumphant
hours
quickening
hearts
a
policeman
eyes
each
waggon
as
it
starts
the
drowsy
showmen
stumble
half
asleep
one
of
them
catcalls
having
drunken
deep
so
out
over
the
pass
into
the
plain
and
the
dawn
finds
them
filling
empty
cans
in
some
dusty
country
lane
where
a
brook
chatters
over
rusty
pans
the
iron
chimneys
of
the
caravans
smoke
as
they
go
and
now
the
fair
has
gone
to
find
a
new
pitch
somewhere
further
on
but
as
the
fair
moved
out
two
lovers
came
ernie
and
bessie
loitering
out
together
bessie
with
wild
eyes
hungry
as
a
flame
ern
like
a
stallion
tugging
at
a
tether
it
was
calm
moonlight
and
october
weather
so
still
so
lovely
as
they
topped
the
ridge
they
brushed
by
jimmy
standing
on
the
bridge
and
as
they
passed
they
gravely
eyed
each
other
and
the
blood
burned
in
each
heart
beating
there
and
out
into
the
bye
street
tottered
mother
without
her
shawl
in
the
october
air
she
cried
and
hair
drooped
on
the
instant
over
face
and
the
two
lovers
clung
in
an
embrace
own
my
as
they
kissed
jimmy
was
envious
of
the
thing
unknown
so
this
was
love
the
something
he
had
missed
woman
and
man
athirst
aflame
alone
envy
went
knocking
at
his
and
face
swam
up
so
dim
so
fair
shining
and
sweet
with
poppies
in
her
hair
iii
after
the
fair
the
gang
began
again
tipping
the
trollies
down
the
banks
of
earth
the
truck
of
stone
clanks
on
the
endless
chain
a
clever
pony
guides
it
to
its
berth
it
tips
the
navvies
shout
for
mirth
to
see
the
pony
step
aside
so
wise
but
jimmy
sighed
thinking
of
eyes
and
when
he
stopped
his
shovelling
he
looked
over
the
junipers
towards
plaister
way
the
beauty
of
his
darling
had
him
hooked
he
had
no
heart
for
wrastling
with
the
clay
lord
almighty
i
must
get
away
o
lord
i
must
i
must
just
see
my
flower
why
i
could
run
there
in
the
dinner
the
whistle
on
the
pilot
engine
blew
the
men
knocked
off
and
jimmy
slipped
aside
over
the
fence
over
the
bridge
and
through
and
then
ahead
along
the
under
the
arching
wide
over
the
hedge
across
the
fields
and
on
the
foreman
asked
jimmy
gurney
gone
it
is
a
mile
and
more
to
end
but
jimmy
ran
the
short
way
by
the
stream
and
there
was
cottage
at
the
bend
with
blue
smoke
on
the
chimney
faint
as
steam
at
home
and
up
his
heart
a
gleam
leapt
like
a
rocket
on
november
nights
and
shattered
slowly
in
a
burst
of
lights
anna
was
singing
at
her
kitchen
fire
she
was
surprised
and
not
well
pleased
to
see
a
sweating
navvy
red
with
heat
and
mire
come
to
her
door
whoever
he
might
be
but
when
she
saw
that
it
was
jimmy
she
smiled
at
his
eyes
upon
her
full
of
pain
and
thought
still
he
come
again
people
will
talk
boys
are
such
crazy
things
but
a
dear
boy
though
he
is
so
so
hurriedly
she
slipped
her
apron
strings
and
dabbed
her
hair
and
wiped
her
fingers
clean
and
came
to
greet
him
languid
as
a
queen
looking
as
sweet
as
fair
as
pure
as
sad
as
when
she
drove
her
loving
husband
mad
boy
she
said
boy
how
hot
you
she
laid
a
cool
hand
to
his
sweating
face
kind
to
come
have
you
been
running
far
just
going
out
come
up
the
road
a
pace
o
dear
these
hens

about
the
so
jimmy
shooed
the
hens
at
her
command
and
got
outside
the
gate
as
she
had
planned

of
his
do
give
me
something
will
you
be
so
kind
something
to
keep
you
always
in
my
mind
will
he
said
go
or
be
he
broke
from
her
and
ran
and
never
dreamt
that
as
she
stood
to
watch
him
from
the
gate
her
heart
was
half
amusement
half
contempt
comparing
jim
the
squab
red
and
unkempt
in
sweaty
corduroys
with
shepherd
ern
she
blew
him
kisses
till
he
passed
the
turn
the
whistle
blew
before
he
reached
the
line
the
foreman
asked
him
what
the
hell
he
meant
whether
a
duke
had
asked
him
out
to
dine
or
if
he
thought
the
bag
would
pay
his
rent
and
jim
was
fined
before
the
foreman
went
but
still
his
spirit
glowed
from
words
cooed
in
the
voice
so
like
a
singing
anna
darling
you
shall
have
a
present
give
you
golden
gems
if
i
were
rich
and
everything
sweet
and
all
he
dropped
his
pick
as
though
he
had
a
stitch
and
stared
end
past
pitch
o
beauty
what
i
have
to
give
give
all
mine
is
yours
beloved
while
i
all
through
the
afternoon
his
pick
was
slacking
his
eyes
were
always
turning
west
and
south
the
foreman
was
inclined
to
send
him
packing
but
put
it
down
to
after
drouth
he
looked
at
jimmy
with
an
ugly
mouth
and
jimmy
slacked
and
muttered
in
a
moan
love
my
beautiful
my
very
so
she
had
loved
another
man
had
had
her
she
had
been
his
with
passion
in
the
night
an
agony
of
envy
made
him
sadder
yet
stabbed
a
pang
of
delight
o
he
would
keep
his
image
of
her
white
the
foreman
cursed
stepped
up
and
asked
him
flat
what
kind
of
he
was
gaping
at
it
was
custom
when
the
pay
day
came
to
take
his
weekly
five
and
twenty
shilling
back
in
the
little
packet
to
his
dame
not
taking
out
a
farthing
for
a
filling
nor
twopence
for
a
pot
for
he
was
willing
that
she
should
have
it
all
to
save
or
spend
but
love
makes
many
lovely
customs
end
next
pay
day
came
and
jimmy
took
the
money
but
not
to
mother
for
he
meant
to
buy
a
locket
for
his
honey
whatever
bellies
hungered
and
went
dry
a
silver
with
a
ruby
eye
he
bought
the
thing
and
paid
the
price
and
hurried
off
to
make
the
sacrifice
it
for
me
you
dear
dear
generous
boy
how
sweet
of
you
wear
it
in
my
dress
when
beside
me
life
is
such
a
joy
you
bring
the
sun
to
she
brushed
his
jacket
with
a
light
caress
his
arms
went
round
her
fast
she
yielded
meek
he
had
the
happiness
to
kiss
her
cheek
dear
my
very
dear
my
jim
how
very
kind
my
jimmy
is
to
me
i
ache
to
think
that
some
are
harsh
to
him
not
like
my
jimmy
beautiful
and
free
my
darling
boy
how
lovely
it
would
be
if
all
would
trust
as
we
two
trust
each
and
heart
grew
hard
against
his
mother
she
poor
old
soul
was
waiting
in
the
gloom
for
pay
that
she
could
do
the
shopping
the
clock
ticked
out
a
solemn
tale
of
doom
clogs
on
the
bricks
outside
went
the
owls
were
coming
out
and
dew
was
dropping
the
bacon
burnt
and
jimmy
not
yet
home
the
clock
was
ticking
dooms
out
like
a
gnome
can
have
kept
him
that
he
come
o
god
tell
me
if
come
to
the
unknown
unseen
evil
struck
her
numb
she
saw
his
body
bloody
in
the
dirt
she
saw
the
life
blood
pumping
through
the
shirt
she
saw
him
tipsy
in
the
booth
she
saw
all
forms
of
evil
but
the
truth
at
last
she
hurried
up
the
line
to
ask
if
jim
were
hurt
or
why
he
back
she
found
the
watchman
wearing
through
his
task
over
the
fire
basket
in
his
shack
behind
the
new
embankment
rose
up
black
he
said
got
to
see
a
dunno
i
think
out
end
thanking
the
man
she
tottered
down
the
hill
the
fang
had
bitten
to
the
bone
the
brook
beside
her
talked
as
water
will
that
it
was
lonely
singing
all
alone
the
night
was
lonely
with
the
tone
and
she
was
lonely
to
the
very
marrow
love
puts
such
bitter
poison
on
arrow
she
went
the
long
way
to
them
by
the
mills
she
told
herself
that
she
must
find
her
son
the
night
was
ominous
of
many
ills
the
soughing
almost
made
her
run
her
boots
hurt
she
had
got
a
stone
in
one
and
bitter
beaks
were
tearing
at
her
liver
that
her
heart
was
turned
from
her
forever
she
kept
the
lane
past
past
the
her
lips
still
muttering
prayers
against
the
worst
and
there
were
people
coming
from
the
sallows
along
the
wild
duck
patch
by
hurst
being
in
moonlight
mother
saw
them
first
she
saw
them
moving
in
the
moonlight
dim
a
woman
with
a
sweet
voice
saying
trembling
she
grovelled
down
into
the
ditch
they
wandered
past
her
pressing
side
to
side
anna
my
if
i
were
it
was
her
son
and
voice
replied
boy
dear
beauty
boy
my
love
and
and
he
but
a
silver
thing
but
i
will
earn
you
better
lockets
by
and
boy
you
i
mean
to
was
that
funny
sort
of
noise
i
heard
the
hedge
a
sort
of
sob
or
coo
listen
may
have
been
a
jim
tossed
a
stone
but
mother
never
stirred
she
hugged
the
hedgerow
choking
down
her
pain
while
the
hot
tears
were
blinding
in
her
brain
the
two
passed
on
the
withered
woman
rose
for
many
minutes
she
could
only
shake
staring
ahead
with
trembling
little
the
noise
a
very
frightened
child
might
make
god
dear
god
let
the
woman
take
my
little
son
god
not
my
little
jim
o
god
have
to
starve
if
i
lose
so
back
she
trembled
nodding
with
her
head
laughing
and
trembling
in
the
bursts
of
tears
her
boots
both
squelching
in
the
tread
her
sagging
to
her
ears
her
heart
too
dumb
with
brokenness
for
fears
the
nightmare
whickering
with
the
laugh
of
death
could
not
have
added
terror
to
her
breath
she
reached
the
house
and
all
right
said
she
just
take
off
my
things
but
all
right
be
all
right
with
just
a
cup
of
tea
if
i
could
only
get
this
grate
to
light
the
damp
and
late
if
i
was
rich
was
what
he
said
o
jim
i
wish
that
god
would
kill
me
while
she
was
blinking
at
the
unlit
grate
scratching
the
moistened
off
the
wood
she
heard
jim
coming
so
she
reached
his
plate
and
forked
the
scraps
of
food
late
she
said

for
life
throughout
the
year
and
a
test
for
any
plough
to
ere
life
tests
a
plough
in
meadows
made
of
stones
love
takes
a
toll
of
spirit
mind
and
bones
i
know
a
portion
when
she
loves
hers
to
give
my
darling
not
to
take
it
lockets
dear
nor
pairs
of
gloves
it
marriage
bells
nor
wedding
cake
up
and
cook
although
the
belly
ache
and
bear
the
child
and
up
and
work
again
and
count
a
sick
grumble
worth
the
pain
will
she
do
this
and
fifty
times
as
much
i
ask
i
warrant
no
one
to
get
a
young
fool
in
her
clutch
and
a
fool
to
let
her
trap
you
so
she
love
you
she
o
jimmy
let
her
go
i
was
so
happy
dear
before
she
came
and
now
going
to
the
grave
in
shame
i
bore
you
jimmy
in
this
very
room
for
fifteen
years
i
got
you
all
you
had
you
were
my
little
son
made
in
my
womb
left
all
to
me
for
god
had
took
your
dad
you
were
a
good
son
doing
all
i
bade
until
this
strumpet
came
from
god
knows
where
and
now
you
lie
and
i
am
in
despair
jimmy
i
say
more
i
know
you
think
that
i
know
being
just
a
withered
old
with
chaps
all
fallen
in
and
eyes
that
blink
and
hands
that
tremble
so
they
can
not
hold
a
bag
of
bones
to
put
in
churchyard
mould
a
hag
beside
your
evening
and
jimmy
gulped
and
thought
god
you
if
i
am
my
dear
i
pretend
i
got
my
eyes
red
jimmy
making
you
my
dear
before
our
love
at
an
end
think
just
a
minute
what
it
is
you
do
if
this
were
right
my
dear
tell
me
true
you
and
so
wrong
you
lie
and
she
lies
too
or
else
you
lie
to
me
women
and
men
have
only
got
one
way
and
that
marriage
other
ways
are
lust
if
you
must
marry
this
one
then
you
may
if
not
drop
say
you
must
or
bring
my
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
dust
marry
your
whore
pay
and
there
an
end
my
god
you
shall
not
have
a
whore
for
friend
by
god
you
shall
not
not
while
alive
never
so
help
me
god
shall
that
thing
be
if
a
woman
fit
to
touch
wive
if
not
whore
and
she
shall
deal
with
me
and
may
blessed
mercy
help
us
see
and
may
he
make
my
jimmy
count
the
cost
my
little
boy
lost
as
i
am
people
in
love
can
not
be
won
by
kindness
and
opposition
makes
them
feel
like
martyrs
when
folk
are
crazy
with
a
drunken
blindness
best
to
flog
them
with
each
garters
and
have
the
flogging
done
by
shropshire
carters
born
under
ercall
where
the
while
stones
lie
ercall
that
smells
of
honey
in
july
jimmy
said
nothing
in
reply
but
thought
that
mother
was
an
old
hard
jealous
thing
love
my
girl
through
good
and
ill
report
i
shall
be
true
whatever
grief
it
and
in
his
heart
he
heard
the
ring
for
death
and
thought
what
it
would
be
to
bury
her
in
churchyard
and
be
free
he
saw
the
narrow
grave
under
the
wall
home
without
mother
nagging
at
his
dear
and
anna
there
with
him
at
evenfall
bidding
him
dry
his
eyes
and
be
of
cheer
death
that
took
poor
mother
brings
me
near
nearer
than
we
have
ever
been
before
near
as
the
dead
one
came
but
dearer
my
son
said
mother
he
said
he
dabbed
her
brow
lips
and
blew
the
light
she
lay
quite
silent
crying
on
the
bed
stirring
no
limb
but
crying
through
the
night
he
slept
convinced
that
he
was
knight
and
when
he
went
to
work
he
left
behind
money
for
mother
crying
herself
blind
after
that
night
he
came
to
call
he
was
a
fly
in
subtle
weavings
mother
had
no
more
share
in
him
at
all
all
that
the
mother
had
was
leavings
there
were
more
lies
more
lockets
more
deceivings
taunts
from
the
proud
old
woman
lies
from
him
and
coo
of
leave
her
also
the
foreman
spoke
make
me
sick
you
you
put
less
mizzle
on
your
bit
of
dick
or
get
your
time
have
no
slackers
here
had
my
eye
on
you
too
long
my
and
jimmy
pondered
while
the
man
attacked
see
her
all
day
long
if
i
were
and
trembling
mother
thought
go
to
give
me
back
my
boy
if
she
were
told
just
what
he
is
to
me
my
pretty
dear
she
leave
me
starving
in
the
cold
like
what
i
but
she
was
weak
and
old
she
thought
if
i
ask
her
afraid
hate
me
ever
after
so
she
stayed
iv
bessie
the
gipsy
got
with
child
by
ern
she
joined
her
tribe
again
at
meen
in
that
old
quarry
overgrown
with
fern
where
goats
are
tethered
on
the
patch
of
green
there
she
reflected
on
the
fool
been
and
plaited
kipes
and
waited
for
the
bastard
and
thought
that
love
was
glorious
while
it
lasted
and
ern
the
moody
man
went
moody
home
to
that
most
gentle
girl
from
ercall
hill
and
bade
her
take
a
heed
now
he
had
come
or
else
by
cripes
put
her
through
the
mill
he
want
her
love
had
his
fill
thank
you
of
her
the
bread
and
butter
sack
and
anna
heard
that
shepherd
ern
was
back
and
have
him
back
to
me
she
muttered
lovesick
boy
of
twenty
green
as
grass
has
made
me
wonder
if
my
brains
are
buttered
he
and
his
lockets
and
his
love
the
ass
i
know
why
he
comes
alas
alas
god
knows
i
want
no
love
but
every
sun
i
bolt
my
doors
on
some
poor
loving
one
it
breaks
my
heart
to
turn
them
out
of
doors
i
hear
them
crying
to
me
in
the
rain
one
with
a
white
face
curses
one
implores
anna
for
sake
let
me
in
again
anna
i
can
not
bear
the
pain
like
hoovey
sheep
bleating
outside
a
fold
anna
in
the
wind
and
cold
i
want
no
men
weary
to
the
soul
of
men
like
moths
about
a
candle
flame
of
men
like
flies
about
a
sugar
bowl
acting
alike
and
all
wanting
the
same
my
swirl
of
passion
never
came
no
man
has
given
me
the
love
i
dreamed
but
in
the
best
of
each
one
something
gleamed
if
my
dear
darling
were
alive
but
he
he
was
the
same
he
understand
the
eyes
of
that
dead
child
are
haunting
me
i
only
turned
the
blanket
with
my
hand
it
hurt
he
died
as
i
had
planned
a
little
skinny
creature
weak
and
red
it
looked
so
peaceful
after
it
was
dead
i
have
been
all
alone
in
spite
of
all
never
a
light
to
help
me
place
my
feet
i
have
had
many
a
pain
and
many
a
fall
a
long
headache
in
a
noisy
street
love
at
the
budding
looks
so
very
sweet
men
put
such
bright
disguises
on
their
lust
and
then
it
all
goes
crumble
into
dust
jimmy
the
same
dear
lovely
jimmy
too
he
goes
the
way
the
others
went
i
shall
bring
sorrow
to
those
eyes
of
blue
he
asks
the
love
sure
i
never
meant
am
i
to
blame
and
all
his
money
spent
men
make
this
shutting
doors
such
cruel
pain
o
ern
i
want
you
in
my
life
on
sunday
afternoons
the
lovers
walk
arm
within
arm
dressed
in
their
sunday
best
the
man
with
the
blue
necktie
sucks
a
stalk
the
woman
answers
when
she
is
addressed
on
quiet
country
stiles
they
sit
to
rest
and
after
fifty
years
of
wear
and
tear
they
think
how
beautiful
their
courtships
were
jimmy
and
anna
met
to
walk
together
the
sunday
after
shepherd
ern
returned
and
hat
was
lovely
with
a
feather
bought
and
dyed
blue
with
money
jimmy
earned
they
walked
towards
callows
farm
and
anna
yearned
boy
she
said
road
is
dull
suppose
we
turn
and
walk
the
other
they
turned
she
sighed
makes
you
sigh
he
asked
she
said
and
grieving
too
perhaps
some
wicked
woman
will
come
masked
into
your
life
my
dear
to
ruin
you
and
trusting
every
woman
as
you
do
it
might
mean
death
to
love
and
be
deceived
take
it
hard
i
thought
and
so
i
one
dear
my
lovely
boy
life
is
all
golden
to
the
finger
tips
what
will
be
must
be
but
a
joy
reach
me
that
lovely
branch
of
scarlet
he
reached
and
gave
she
put
it
to
her
lips
here
she
said
come
to
plaister
and
then
she
chose
the
road
to
shepherd
as
the
deft
angler
when
the
fishes
rise
flicks
on
the
broadening
circle
over
each
the
delicatest
touch
of
dropping
flies
then
pulls
more
line
and
whips
a
longer
reach
longing
to
feel
the
rod
bend
the
reel
screech
and
the
quick
comrade
net
the
monster
out
so
anna
played
the
fly
over
her
trout
twice
she
passed
thrice
she
with
the
boy
beside
her
a
lovely
fly
hooked
for
a
human
heart
she
passed
his
little
gate
while
jimmy
eyed
her
feeling
her
beauty
tear
his
soul
apart
then
did
the
great
trout
rise
the
great
pike
dart
the
gate
went
clack
a
man
came
up
the
hill
the
lucky
strike
had
hooked
him
through
the
gill
her
breath
comes
quick
her
tired
beauty
glows
she
would
not
look
behind
she
looked
ahead
it
seemed
to
jimmy
she
was
like
a
rose
a
golden
white
rose
faintly
flushed
with
red
her
eyes
danced
quicker
at
the
approaching
tread
her
finger
nails
dug
sharp
into
her
palm
she
yearned
to
shoulder
and
kept
calm
said
shepherd
ern
she
turned
and
eyed
him
cold
and
surprised
but
interested
too
to
see
how
much
he
felt
the
hook
inside
him
and
how
much
be
surmised
and
jimmy
knew
and
if
her
beauty
still
could
make
him
do
the
love
tricks
he
had
gambolled
in
the
past
a
glow
shot
through
her
that
her
fish
was
grassed
she
said
jimmy
felt
jealous
and
angry
at
the
tone
he
longed
to
hit
the
nose
a
belt
he
wanted
his
beloved
his
alone
a
girl
should
be
a
own
ern
gave
the
lad
a
glance
and
turned
to

jimmy
longed
to
hit
the
man

swipe
under
the
chin
to
knock
him
out
of
time
but
anna
stayed

gipsy

he
bit
said
ern
and
anna
smiled
and
jimmy
saw
the
smile
and
watched
her
face
while
all
the
jealous
devils
made
him
wild
a
third
in
love
is
always
out
of
place
and
then
her
gentle
body
full
of
grace
leaned
to
him
sweetly
as
she
tossed
her
head
we
be
getting
on
she
said
they
walked
but
jimmy
turned
to
watch
the
third
here
not
you
he
said
the
shepherd
grinned
anna
was
smiling
sweet
without
a
word
she
got
the
scarlet
berry
branch
unpinned
cold
she
said
evening
in
the
a
quick
glance
showed
that
jimmy
mind
her
she
beckoned
with
the
berry
branch
behind
her
then
dropped
it
gently
on
the
broken
stones
preoccupied
unheeding
walking
straight
saying
jealous
boy
in
even
tones
looking
so
beautiful
so
delicate
being
so
very
sweet
but
at
her
gate
she
felt
her
shoe
unlaced
and
looked
to
know
if
ern
had
taken
up
the
sprig
or
no
he
had
she
smiled
said
jimmy
sadly
not
fit
to
be
a
friend
of
yourn
nobbut
just
an
oaf
i
love
you
madly
and
hearing
you
speak
kind
made
me
burn
who

he
then
she
answered
ern
a
pleasant
man
an
old
old
friend
of
cripes
then
anna
drop
him
a
she
said
must
have
faith
in
me
all
the
battle
in
a
love
like
ours
you
must
believe
my
darling
you
see
that
life
to
have
its
sweets
must
have
its
sours
love
always
two
souls
picking
flowers
you
must
have
faith
i
give
you
all
i
can
what
i
say
good
evening
to
a
man
he
replied
not
a
man
like
not
a
man
like
him
she
said
next
by
this
reached
her
cottage
in
the
dim
among
the
daisies
that
the
cold
had
kexed
i
say
now
anna
be
more
than
vexed
she
said
words
like
these
you
say
indeed
how
dare
you
leave
me
my
she
was
cold
proud
and
imperious
with
a
lifting
lip
blazing
within
but
outwardly
controlled
he
had
a
first
instant
of
the
whip
the
long
lash
curled
to
cut
a
second
strip
to
presume
to
teach
of
course
i
know
sunday
scholar
you
she
slammed
the
door
behind
her
clutching
skirts
he
heard
her
bedroom
latches
thud
he
learned
at
last
how
bitterly
love
hurts
he
longed
to
cut
her
throat
and
see
her
blood
to
stamp
her
blinking
eyeballs
into
mud
by
god
many
torments
make
that
tune
soon
change
to
for
he
beat
the
door
for
her
she
never
stirred
but
primming
bitter
lips
before
her
glass
admired
her
hat
as
though
she
heard
and
tried
her
front
hair
parted
and
in
mass
she
heard
her
hasty
footsteps
pass
gone
she
thought
she
crouched
below
the
pane
and
heard
him
cursing
as
he
tramped
the
lane
rage
ran
in
jimmy
as
he
tramped
the
night
rage
strongly
mingled
with
a
disgust
at
finding
a
beloved
woman
light
and
all
her
precious
beauty
dirty
dust
a
gilded
over
lust
nothing
but
that
he
sat
him
down
to
rage
beside
the
stream
whose
waters
never
age
plashing
it
slithered
down
the
tiny
fall
to
eddy
wrinkles
in
the
trembling
pool
with
that
light
voice
whose
music
can
not
pall
always
the
note
of
solace
cool
and
when
man
has
been
a
fool
he
could
not
do
a
wiser
thing
than
go
to
that
dim
pool
where
purple
teazles
grow
he
glowered
there
until
suspicion
came
suspicion
bastard
with
mean
tongue
to
mutter
to
him
till
his
heart
was
flame
and
every
fibre
of
his
soul
was
wrung
that
even
then
ern
and
his
anna
clung
mouth
against
mouth
in
passionate
embrace
there
was
no
peace
for
jimmy
in
the
place
raging
he
hurried
back
to
learn
the
truth
the
little
swinging
wicket
glimmered
white
the
chimney
jagged
the
skyline
like
a
tooth
bells
came
in
swoons
for
it
was
sunday
night
the
garden
was
all
dark
but
there
was
light
up
in
the
little
room
where
anna
slept
the
hot
blood
beat
his
brain
he
crept
he
crept
clutching
himself
to
hear
clutching
to
know
along
the
path
rustling
with
withered
leaves
up
to
the
apple
too
decayed
to
blow
which
crooked
a
palsied
finger
at
the
eaves
and
up
the
lichened
trunk
his
body
heaves
dust
blinded
him
twigs
snapped
the
branches
shook
he
leaned
along
a
mossy
bough
to
look
nothing
at
first
except
a
guttering
candle
shaking
amazing
shadows
on
the
ceiling
then
voice
upon
a
bar
of
where
have
you
been
and
voice
and
music
reeling
trembling
as
though
she
sang
with
flooding
feeling
the
singing
stopped
midway
upon
the
stair
then
anna
showed
in
white
with
loosened
hair
her
back
was
towards
him
and
she
stood
awhile
like
a
wild
creature
tossing
back
her
mane
and
then
her
head
went
back
he
saw
a
smile
on
the
half
face
half
turned
towards
the
pane
her
eyes
closed
and
her
arms
went
out
again
jim
gritted
teeth
and
called
upon
his
maker
she
drooped
into
a
arms
there
to
take
her
agony
first
sharp
sudden
like
a
knife
then
down
the
tree
to
batter
at
the
door
there
let
me
in
have
your
life

jezebel
of

give
you
throwing
bats
about
my
son
dear

you
and
the
light
went
out
the
windows
stared
out
blind
blind
as
blind
eyes
forever
seeing
dark
and
in
the
dim
the
lovers
went
upstairs
her
eyes
fast
closed
the
burning
stark
his
lips
entangled
in
her
straying
hairs
breath
coming
short
as
in
a
prayers
her
stealthy
face
all
drowsy
in
the
dim
and
full
of
shudders
as
she
yearned
to
him
jim
crossed
the
water
cursing
in
his
tears
cripes
you
wait
my
god
with
her
now
and
all
her
hair
pulled
down
over
her
ears
loving
the
blaggard
like
a
filthy
sow
i
saw
her
kiss
him
from
the
apple
bough
they
say
a
whore
is
always
full
of
wiles
o
god
how
sweet
her
eyes
are
when
she
smiles

guzzle

him

some
evening
on
the
crown
o
god
o
god
what
pretty
ways
she
had
kissing
all
her
skin
so
white
and
soft
kissing
back
i
think
going
mad
like
rutting
rattens
in
the
apple
loft
she
held
that
light
she
carried
high
aloft
full
in
my
eyes
for
him
to
hit
me
by
i
had
the
light
all
dazzling
in
my
eye
she
had
her
dress
all
clutched
up
to
her
shoulder
and
all
her
naked
arm
was
all
one
gleam
going
to
freeze
turning
colder
i
wish
there
was
more
water
in
the
stream
drownd
myself
perhaps
all
a
dream
and
bye
and
bye
wake
and
find
it
stuff
by
crimes
the
pain
i
real
about
two
hundred
yards
from
gunder
loss
he
stopped
to
shudder
leaning
on
the
gate
he
bit
the
touchwood
underneath
the
moss
like
her
he
muttered
in
his
hate
he
spat
it
out
again
with
you
wait
see
again
before
past
in
this
life
he
laughs
longest
who
laughs
all
through
the
night
the
stream
ran
to
the
sea
the
different
water
always
saying
the
same
and
then
a
tinkle
never
glee
a
lonely
little
child
alone
in
shame
an
otter
snapped
a
thorn
twig
when
he
came
it
drifted
down
it
passed
the
hazel
mill
it
passed
the
springs
but
jimmy
stayed
there
still
over
the
pointed
came
the
light
out
of
the
mists
on
ercall
came
the
sun
red
like
a
huntsman
halloing
after
night
blowing
a
horn
to
rouse
up
everyone
through
many
glittering
cities
he
had
run
splashing
the
wind
vanes
on
the
dewy
roofs
with
golden
sparks
struck
by
his
hoofs
the
watchman
rose
rubbing
his
rusty
eyes
he
stirred
the
pot
of
cocoa
for
his
mate
the
fireman
watched
his
head
of
power
rise
time
he
asked
long
to

whistle
shrieked
its
message

the

a
drunken
man

muddled
all

the
foreman

drunkenly
across
a
sleeper

his
at
the
station

blast
beyond
the
bridge
a
sharp
turn
to
the
right
leads
to
bull
and
boar
the
rest
an
inn
so
hidden
it
is
out
of
sight
to
anyone
not
coming
from
the
west
the
high
embankment
hides
it
with
its
crest
far
up
above
the
chester
trains
go
by
the
drinkers
see
them
sweep
against
the
sky
canal
men
used
it
when
the
barges
came
the
navvies
used
it
when
the
line
was
making
the
pigeons
strut
and
sidle
ruffling
tame
the
chuckling
brook
in
front
sets
shadows
shaking
cider
and
beer
for
thirsty
slaking
a
quiet
house
like
all
that
god
controls
it
is
instrument
on
human
souls
thither
jim
turned
now
drink
he
said
drink
and
drink
i
never
did
before
drink
and
drink
until
mad
or
dead
for
what
comes
of
meddling
with
a
he
called
for
liquor
at
bull
and
moody
he
drank
the
woman
asked
him
why
you
had
trouble
he
said
dry
dry
and
burnt
up
so
another
drink
better
much
better
the
and
then
he
sang
so
that
he
should
not
think
his
song
but
cut
it
short
his
wits
were
working
like
a
wort
until
among
them
came
the
vision
gleaming
of
ern
with
bloody
nose
and
anna
screaming
what
do
he
muttered
him
out
and
kick
his
face
in
with
a
running
jump
not
have
dazzled
eyes
this
second
bout
and
she
can
wash
the
fragments
under
it
was
his
ace
but
death
had
played
a
trump
death
the
blind
beggar
chuckled
nodding
dumb
game
the
shroud
is
ready
jimmy
meanwhile
the
mother
waiting
for
her
child
had
tottered
out
a
dozen
times
to
search
she
said
drive
your
mother
wild
your
too
good
a
name
to
smirch
come
home
my
dear
leave
you
in
the
lurch
he
was
so
good
my
little
jim
so
clever
he
never
stop
a
night
away
not
ever
he
never
slept
a
night
away
till
now
never
not
once
in
all
the
time
been
the
will
they
say
and
we
must
bow
but
o
like
a
knife
it
cuts
so
keen
work
sunday
clothes
be
seen
and
then
laugh
and
say
it
strange
he
slept
with
her
and
so
he
change
perhaps
she
thought
wrong
perhaps
dead
killed
himself
like
folk
do
in
love
they
say
he
never
tells
what
passes
in
his
head
and
been
looking
late
so
old
and
grey
a
railway
train
has
cut
his
head
away
like
the
poor
hare
we
found
at
shack
o
god
have
pity
bring
my
darling
back
all
the
high
stars
went
sweeping
through
the
sky
the
sun
made
all
the
orient
clean
clear
gold
blessed
god
she
prayed
let
me
die
or
bring
my
lamb
back
into
fold
the
gone
and
all
the
cold
i
must
know
somehow
if
on
the
line
he
could
have
bacon
sandwich
when
he
she
cut
the
bread
and
started
short
of
breath
up
the
canal
now
draining
for
the
rail
a
poor
old
woman
pitted
against
death
bringing
her
pennyworth
of
love
for
bail
wisdom
beauty
and
love
may
not
avail
she
was
too
late
he
was
here
oh
yes
he
chucked
his
job
and
i
but
he
been
he
went
perhaps
you
missed
him
perhaps
he
took
the
field
path
yonder
through
the
bent
he
very
likely
done
that
he
chaps
the
speaker
tested
both
his
trouser
straps
and
took
his
pick
in
the
town
he
said
be
all
right
after
a
bit
in
she
trembled
down
the
high
ridge
glad
though
too
late
not
yet
too
late
indeed
for
forty
yards
away
beyond
the
bridge
jimmy
still
drank
the
devil
still
sowed
seed
bit
in
bed
she
thought
what
i
need
go
to
bull
and
boar
and
rest
a
bit
got
a
bench
outside
let
me
even
as
two
soldiers
on
a
fortress
wall
see
the
bright
fire
streak
of
a
coming
shell
catch
breath
and
wonder
way
will
it
fall
to
you
to
me
or
will
it
all
be
well
so
stood
life
and
death
and
could
not
tell
whether
go
to
and
find
her
son
or
take
the
field
and
let
the
doom
be
done
not
the
inn
she
thought
would
talk
i
in
the
open
daytime
no
just
sit
here
upon
the
timber
balk
rest
for
just
a
minute
and
then
resting
her
old
tired
heart
began
to
glow
glowed
and
gave
thanks
and
thought
itself
in
clover
lost
his
job
so
now
throw
him
sitting
she
saw
the
rustling
the
picks
flash
bright
above
the
trollies
tip
the
shining
full
of
silver
specks
and
three
swift
children
running
down
the
dip
a
stoke
saint
michael
carter
cracked
his
whip
the
water
in
the
runway
made
its
din
she
half
heard
singing
coming
from
the
inn
she
turned
and
left
the
inn
and
took
the
path
and
life
you
lose
said
brother
death
as
the
lord
of
all
appointed
hath
in
this
great
miracle
of
blood
and
he
doeth
all
things
well
as
the
book
saith
he
bids
the
changing
stars
fulfil
their
turn
his
hand
is
on
us
when
we
least
discern
slowly
she
tottered
stopping
with
the
stitch
catching
her
breath
lawks
a
dear
a
dear
how
the
poor
tubings
in
my
heart
do
twitch
it
hurts
like
the
rheumatics
very
and
every
painful
footstep
drew
her
clear
from
that
young
life
she
bore
with
so
much
pain
she
never
had
him
to
herself
again
out
of
the
inn
came
jimmy
red
with
drink
crying
show
her
wait
a
bit
show

wait
a
bit
not

kid

her
nor
him
you
out
of
my
way
you
fowls
or
else
rip
the
red
things
off
your
he
went
across
the
fields
to
end
there
was
a
lot
of
water
in
the
brook
sun
and
white
cloud
and
weather
on
the
mend
for
any
man
with
any
eyes
to
look
he
found
old
which
he
took
innings
now
my
pretty
dear
said
he
wait
a
bit
show
you
now
her
chimney
smoke
was
blowing
blue
and
faint
the
wise
duck
shook
a
tail
across
the
pool
the
shanty
smelt
of
burning
paint
four
cartwheels
hung
to
cool
he
had
loved
the
place
when
under
rule
now
he
clenched
teeth
and
flung
aside
the
gate
there
at
the
door
they
stood
he
grinned
ern
had
just
brought
her
in
a
wired
hare
she
stood
beside
him
stroking
down
the
fur
ern
poor
thing

how
its
eyes
do
stare

he
answered
a
she
stroked
the
breast
and
plucked
away
a
bur
she
kissed
the
pads
and
leapt
back
with
a
shout
god
got
the
spudder
ern
look
ern
clenched
his
fists
too
late
he
felt
no
pain
only
incredible
haste
in
something
swift
a
shock
that
made
the
sky
black
on
his
brain
then
stillness
while
a
little
cloud
went
drift
the
weight
upon
his
thigh
bones
lift
then
poultry
in
a
long
procession
came
doing
the
eyes
like
flame
old
cocks
and
hens
sedate
in
age
marching
with
jerks
as
though
they
moved
on
springs
with
sidelong
hate
in
round
eyes
red
with
rage
and
shouldered
muskets
clipped
by
jealous
wings
then
an
array
of
horns
and
stupid
things
sheep
on
a
hill
with
harebells
hare
for
dinner
a
slow
darkness
covered
up
the
sinner
little
time
is
right
hand
fain
of
only
a
second
changes
life
to
death
hate
ends
before
the
pulses
cease
to
go
there
is
great
power
in
the
stop
of
breath
too
great
truth
in
what
the
dumb
thing
saith
hate
never
goes
so
far
as
that
nor
can
am
what
life
becomes

and
broke
out
praying

poor
old
mother

last
wages

he
said
he
trod
his

free
journey
down
the
street
treading
the
middle
road
and
seeing
both
sides
the
school
the
inns
the
butchers
selling
meat
the
busy
market
where
the
town
divides
then
past
the
tanpits
full
of
stinking
hides
and
up

lane
to

weak
as

in
your
but
wiser

and
not
so
hot
married
or
buried

wives
or

these
unmanned
unattached
maries
and
susans

no
better
than
a
proper
i
if
you
you
look
on
women
as
as
good
as
the
kind
of
talk
that
makes
me
ill
when
have
they
been
as
good
i
ask
you
when
they
now
and
then
one
or
two
was
neither
hen
nor
for
your
mother
that
here
comes
the
guilty
thumbs
down
no
hope
the
judge
passed
sentence
frantic
passionate
youth
unfit
for
life
a
fitting
time
afforded
for
repentance
then
certain
justice
with
a
pitiless
knife
for
her
his
wretched
widowed
wife
pity
for
her
who
bore
him
pity
cheers
the
jury
were
exempt
for
seven
all
bowed
the
judge
passed
to
the
dismissed
his
clerks
disrobed
and
knelt
and
prayed
as
was
his
custom
after
passing
doom
doom
upon
life
upon
the
thing
not
made
god
who
made
us
out
of
dust
and
laid
thee
in
us
bright
to
lead
us
to
the
truth
o
god
have
pity
upon
this
poor
youth
show
him
thy
grace
o
god
before
he
die
shine
in
his
heart
have
mercy
upon
me
who
deal
the
laws
men
make
to
travel
by
under
the
sun
upon
the
path
to
thee
o
god
thou
knowest
as
blind
as
he
as
blind
as
frantic
not
so
single
worse
only
thy
pity
spared
me
from
the
curse
thy
pity
and
thy
mercy
god
did
save
thy
bounteous
gifts
not
any
grace
of
mine
from
all
the
pitfalls
leading
to
the
grave
from
all
the
with
the
husks
and
swine
god
who
hast
given
me
all
things
now
make
shine
bright
in
this
heart
that
he
may
see
god
take
this
poor
spirit
back
to
then
trembling
with
his
hands
for
he
was
old
he
went
to
meet
his
college
friend
the
dean
the
loiterers
watched
him
as
his
carriage
rolled
goes
the
judge
said
one
and
one
was
keen
that
wretched
boy
where
a
policeman
spat
two
lawyers
talked
statistics
crime
passionel
in
agricultural
hang
a
but
one
said
this
sentimental
talk
is
rotten
rotten
the
the
law
and
not
half
strict
enough
forgers
and
murderers
are
misbegotten
let
them
be
hanged
and
let
them
be
forgotten
a
rotten
fool
should
have
a
rotten
end
mend
them
you
say
the
rotten
never
and
one
mend
the
rotten
not
perhaps
the
rotting
would
so
would
the
just
infected
a
week
in
quod
has
ruined
lots
of
chaps
all
got
good
in
them
till
prison
wrecked
and
one
must
be
just
a
kid
she
trapped
she
be
mid
be
and
he
so
the
talk
went
and
anna
took
the
train
too
sad
for
tears
and
pale
a
lady
spoke
asking
if
she
were
ill
or
suffering
pain
she
said
but
sorrow
made
her
choke
only
sick
because
my
heart
is
broke
my
friend
a
man
my
oldest
friend
here
died
i
had
to
see
the
man
who
killed
him
tried
to
be
hanged
only
a
boy
my
friend
i
thought
him
just
a
boy
i
know
and
ern
was
killed
and
now
the
to
end
and
all
because
he
thought
he
loved
me
dear
the
lady
said
and
anna
very
hard
to
bear
the
ills
men
make
he
thought
he
loved
and
it
was
all
dear
the
lady
said
poor
poor
woman
have
you
no
friends
to
go
to
alone
parents
living
but
both
inhuman
and
none
can
cure
what
pierces
to
the
bone
have
to
leave
and
go
where
not
known
begin
my
life
her
friend
said
certainly
that
but
leave
me
your
address
for
i
might
hear
of
something
enquire
perhaps
the
boy
might
be
reprieved
or
pardoned
we
ask
the
rector
or
the
squire
to
write
and
ask
the
judge
he
be
hardened
what
do
you
do
is
it
housework
have
you
gardened
your
hands
are
very
white
and
soft
to
not
had
heart
for
doing
so
the
talk
passes
as
the
train
descends
into
the
vale
and
halts
and
starts
to
climb
to
where
the
country
ends
and
hills
rise
sweet
with
thyme
where
clinking
sheepbells
make
a
broken
chime
and
sunwarm
gorses
rich
the
air
with
scent
and
kestrels
poise
for
mice
there
anna
went
there
in
the
april
in
the
one
heard
her
in
the
morning
singing
sweet
calling
the
birds
from
the
unbudded
rose
offering
her
lips
with
grains
for
them
to
eat
the
redbreasts
come
with
little
wiry
feet
sparrows
and
tits
and
all
wild
feathery
things
brushing
her
lifted
face
with
quivering
wings
jimmy
was
taken
down
into
a
cell
he
did
not
need
a
hand
he
made
no
fuss
the
men
were
kind
what
the
kid
done
well
the
same
might
come
to
any
one
of
they
brought
him
bits
of
cake
at
tea
time
thus
the
love
that
fashioned
all
in
human
ken
works
in
the
marvellous
hearts
of
simple
men
and
in
the
nights
they
watched
him
night
and
day
they
told
him
bits
of
stories
through
the
grating
of
how
the
game
went
at
the
football
play
and
how
the
rooks
outside
had
started
mating
and
all
the
time
they
knew
the
rope
was
waiting
and
every
evening
friend
would
say
to
friend
hope
not
to
drag
him
at
the
and
poor
old
mother
came
to
see
her
son
lord
has
gave
she
said
lord
has
took
i
loved
you
very
dear
my
darling

and
now

but

promise
written
in
his
book

will
not
fail
but
oh

do
seem
she
hired
a
room
outside
the
prison
yard
did
you
get
the
money
for
the
room
and
how
are
you
living
mother

the
parish

lied
to

that
time
o

brought
home
half
my
wages

i
spent
and
you
went
short
that
week

the
rent

went
to
i
spent
my
money
on
her
and
you
who
bore
me
paid
the
cost
in
pain
you
went
without
to
buy
the
clothes
upon
her
a
hat
a
locket
and
a
silver
chain
o
mother

if

now
all
alone
here
left
to

there

never
him
down

working

i
made
with
many

we
made
