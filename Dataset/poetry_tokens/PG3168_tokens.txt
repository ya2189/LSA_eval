with
the
farewell
lift
me
to
the
moon
now
late
to
leave

one
who
if
poor
soul
her
man
goes
underground
will
not
recover
as

might
have
done
in

hopes
abound
waving
from
the

palely
grieving
as
down
we
draw
her
tears
make
little
show

now
she
suffers
more
than
at
my
leaving
some
twenty
years

pray
those
left
at

will
care
for

shall
come

down
drenchingly

through

blearily
eerily
lit
our
pale
faces
outstretched
for
one
kiss
while
we
stood
prest
to
them
with
a
last
quest
to
them
not
to
court
perils
that
honour
could
miss
v
sharp
were
those
sighs
of
ours
blinded
these
eyes
of
ours
when
at
last
moved
away
under
the
arch
all
we
loved
aid
for
them

woman
prayed
for

track

guard
their

them

called
this
world
of
the
darkest
thinkable
and
questioned
sadly
if
my
own
land
could
heave
its
pulse
less
gladly
so
charged
it
seemed
with
circumstance
whence
springs
the
tragedy
of

the
irony

morrow

fog
hangs
thicker
the
postman
nears
and
goes
a
letter
is
brought
whose
lines
disclose
by
the
firelight
flicker
his
hand
whom
the
worm
now
knows
in
highest
of
his
hoped
return
and
of
jaunts
by
brake
and
burn
in
the
summer
weather
and
of
new
love
that
they
would
learn
the
souls
of
the
slain
i
the
thick
lids
of
night
closed
upon
me
alone
at
the
bill
of
the
isle
by
the
race
bald
wrinkled
of
and
with
darkness
and
silence
the
spirit
was
on
me
to
brood

be
still
ii
no
wind
fanned
the
flats
of
the
ocean
or
promontory
sides
or
the
ooze
by
the
strand
or
the
slope
of
the
land
whose
base
took
its
rest
amid
everlong
motion
of
tides
iii
soon
from
out
of
the
southward
seemed
nearing
a
whirr
as
of
wings
waved
by
flies
or
by
of
measureless
size
and
in
softness
and
smoothness
beyond
hearing
of
corporal
things
iv
and
they
bore
to
the
bluff
and
a
train
of
sprites
without
mould
frameless
souls
none
might
touch
or
might
on
the
ledge
by
the
turreted
lantern
farsighted
by
men
of
the
main
v
and
i
heard
them
say
and
i
knew
them
for
souls
of
the
felled
on
the
nether
bord
under
capricorn
whither
warred
and
i
neared
in
my
awe
and
gave
heedfulness
to
them
with
breathings
inheld
vi
then
it
seemed
there
approached
from
the
northward
a
senior
of
the
like
filmy
hue
and
he
met
them
and
spake
it
you
o
my
men
said
they
we
bear
homeward
and
hearthward
to
list
to
our
fame
vii
flown
there
before
you
he
said
then
households
are
well
kin
linger
less
on
your
glory
arid
than
on
dearer
cried
these
from
the
dead
then
what
do
they
tell
viii
mothers
muse
sadly
and
murmur
your
doings
as
recall
the
quaint
ways
of
your
innocent
days
some
pray
that
ere
dying
your
faith
had
grown
firmer
and
higher
your
joys
ix
father
broods
i
had
set
him
to
some
humble
trade
and
so
slacked
his
high
fire
and
his
passionate
martial
desire
had
told
him
no
stories
to
woo
him
and
whet
him
to
this
due
crusade
x
general
how
hold
out
our
sweethearts
sworn
loyal
as
doves
mourn
many
think
it
is
not
unattractive
to
prink
them
in
sables
for
heroes
some
fickle
and
fleet
hearts
have
found
them
new
xi
our
wives
quoth
another
resignedly
they
on
our
deeds
of
home
that
live
yet
fresh
as
of
fondness
or
fret
ancient
words
that
were
kindly
expressed
or
unkindly
these
these
have
their
xii
then
it
seems
that
our
glory
weighs
less
in
their
thought
than
our
old
homely
acts
and
the
commonplace
facts
of
our
by
us
as
scarce
part
of
our
story
and
rated
as
nought
xiii
then
bitterly
some
it
wise
now
to
raise
the
for
such
knowledge
away
but
the
rest
we
prized
till
yet
that
hearts
keep
us
green
for
old
kindness
we
prize
now
a
thousand
times
more
xiv
thus
speaking
the
trooped
apparitions
began
to
disband
and
resolve
them
in
two
those
whose
record
was
lovely
and
true
bore
to
northward
for
home
those
of
bitter
traditions
again
left
the
land
xv
and
towering
to
seaward
in
legions
they
paused
at
a
spot
overbending
the
that
engulphing
ghast
sinister
whither
headlong
they
plunged
to
the
fathomless
regions
of
myriads
forgot
xvi
and
the
spirits
of
those
who
were
homing
passed
on
rushingly
like
the
pentecost
wind
and
the
whirr
of
their
wayfaring
thinned
and
surceased
on
the
sky
and
but
left
in
the
gloaming
and
me
song
of
the
wives
i
at
last
in
sight
of
home
again
of
home
again
no
more
to
range
and
roam
again
as
at
that
bygone
time
no
more
to
go
away
from
us
and
stay
from
us
dawn
hold
not
long
the
day
from
us
but
quicken
it
to
prime
ii
now
all
the
town
shall
ring
to
them
shall
ring
to
them
and
we
who
love
them
cling
to
them
and
clasp
them
joyfully
and
cry
much
do
for
you
anew
for
you
dear
loves
draw
and
hew
for
you
come
back
from
iii
some
told
us
we
should
meet
no
more
should
meet
no
more
should
wait
and
wish
but
greet
no
more
your
faces
round
our
fires
that
in
a
while
uncharily
and
drearily
men
gave
their
wearily
like
those
whom
living
tires
iv
and
now
you
are
nearing
home
again
dears
home
again
no
more
may
be
to
roam

at

bygone
time
which
took
you
far
away
from
us
to
stay
from
us

hold
not
long

day
from

but
quicken
it
to
prime
the
sick
god
i
in
days
when
men
had
joy
of
war
a
god
of
battles
sped
each
mortal
jar
the
peoples
pledged
him
heart
and
hand
from
land
to
isles
afar
ii
his
crimson
form
with
clang
and
chime
flashed
on
each
murk
and
murderous
and
kings
invoked
for
rape
and
raid
his
fearsome
aid
in
rune
and
rhyme
iii
on
bruise
and
scar
and
seam
on
blade
and
bolt
he
flung
his
fulgid
beam
his
haloes
rayed
the
very
gore
and
corpses
wore
his
iv
often
an
early
king
or
queen

storied
hero
onward
knew
his
sheen
glimpsed

on

blue
demesne
v
but
new
light
spread
that
gold
nimb
and
blazon
have
waned
dimmer
and
more
dim
even
his
flushed
form
begins
to
fade
till
but
a
shade
is
left
of
him
vi
that
modern
meditation
broke
his
spell
that
pleadings
dealt
a
stroke
say
some
and
some
that
crimes
too
dire
did
much
to
mire
his
crimson
cloak
vii
yea
seeds
of
crescive
sympathy
were
sown
by
those
more
excellent
than
he
long
known
though
long
contemned
till
the
gods
of
men
in
amity
viii
souls
have
grown
seers
and

mournful
of

form

know
not
how
x
yet
wars
arise
though
zest
grows
cold
wherefore
at

in

mould

thee

a

who
showed
an

that
bore
the
image
of
a
constantine
she
lightly
passed
nor
did
she
once
opine
how
better
than

she
had
raised
for
me

swift

in

with
one

her
act
flashed
home

rome
on
the

walked
where
victor

was
shrined
awhile
and
passed
to
rich
red

whence
thridding
cave
and
criptoportico
we
gained
dissolving
pile
and
each
ranked
ruin
tended
to
beguile
the
outer
sense
and
shape
itself
as
though
it
wore
its
marble
hues
its
pristine
glow
of
scenic
frieze
and
pompous
peristyle
when
lo
swift
hands
on
strings
nigh
began
to
melodize
a
waltz
by

stirred
me
as

blended

with

the

sat
in

at

mid
of

it
seemed
to
grow
still
and
the
people
to
pass
away
and
the
chiselled
shapes
to
combine
in
a
haze
of
sun
till
beside
a
carrara
column
there
gleamed
forth
one
she
was
nor
this
nor
that
of
those
beings
divine
but
each
and
the
essence
of
all
the
nine
with
tentative

she
neared
to
my
a
pensive
smile
on
her
sweet
small
marvellous
face
so
long

thee

she
you

as

phases

at

rome
at
the
pyramid
of
cestius
near
the
graves
of
shelley
and
keats
who
then
was
cestius
and
what
is
he
to
me
amid
thick
thoughts
and
memories
multitudinous
one
thought
alone
brings
he
i
can
recall
no
word
of
anything
he
did
for
me
he
is
a
man
who
died
and
was
interred
to
leave
a
pyramid
whose
purpose
was
exprest
not
with
its
first
design
nor
till
far
down
in
time
beside
it
found
their
rest
two
countrymen
of
mine
cestius
in

maybe
slew
breathed
out
threatening
i
know
not
this
i
know
in
death
all
silently
he
does
a
kindlier
thing
in
beckoning
pilgrim
feet
with
marble
finger
high
to
where
by
shadowy
wall
and
street
those
matchless
singers
lie
then
he
lived
and
died
that
stones
which
bear
his
name
should
mark
through
time
where
two
immortal
shades
abide
it
is
an
ample
fame
lausanne
in
old
garden
of
the
completion
of
and
the
same
hour
and
a
spirit
seems
to
pass
formal
in
pose
but
grave
and
grand
withal
he
contemplates
a
volume
stout
and
tall
and
far
lamps
fleck
him
through
the
thin
acacias
anon
the
book
is
closed
with
is
finished
and
at
the
end
he
turns
and
soon
on
me
his
glances
bend
and
as
from
earth
comes
muted
yet
composed
fares
the
truth
now
pens
but
slily
further
her
advance
may
one
not
speed
her
but
in
phrase
askance
do
scribes
aver
the
comic
to
be
reverend
still
rule
those
minds
on
earth
at
whom
sage
wormwood
words
were
hurled
like
a
bastard
comes
into
the
without
to
him
who
gives
her
zermatt
to
the
matterhorn
years
since
up
against
the
sun
seven
shapes
thin
atomies
to
lower
sight
labouringly
leapt
and
gained
thy
gabled
height
and
four
lives
paid
for
what
the
seven
had
won
they
were
the
first
by
whom
the
deed
was
done
and
when
i
look
at
thee
my
mind
takes
flight
to
that
tragic
feat
of
manly
might
as
though
till
then
of
history
thou
hadst
none
yet
ages
ere
men
topped
thee
late
and
soon
thou
each
night
the
planets
lift
and
lower
thou
to
pausing
sun
and
moon
and
the
tokening
sky
when
power
approached
its
bloody
end
yea
that
noon
when
darkness
filled
the
earth
till
the
ninth
hour
the
bridge
of
lodi
i
when
of
tender
mind
and
body
i
was
moved
by
minstrelsy
and
that
strain
bridge
of
brought
a
strange
delight
to
me
ii
in
the
jingle
of
its
tune
i
could
see
the
armies
mingle
and
the
columns
cleft
and
hewn
iii
on
that
spot
by
lodi
where
napoleon
clove
his
way
to
his
fame
when
like
a
god
he
bent
the
nations
to
his
sway
iv
hence
the
tune
came
capering
to
me
while
i
traced
the
rhone
and
po
nor
could
marvel
woo
me
from
the
spot
englamoured
so
v
and
sunlit
and
smiling
here
i
stand
upon
the
scene
with
its
saffron
walls
dun
tiling
and
its
meads
of
maiden
green
vi
even
as
when
the
trackway
thundered
with
the
charge
of
grenadiers
and
the
blood
of
forty
hundred
splashed
its
parapets
and
piers
vii
any
ancient
crone
toady
like
a
lass
in
prime
could
she
tell
some
tale
of
lodi
at
that
moving
mighty
time
viii
so
i
ask
the
wives
of
lodi
for
traditions
of
that
day
but
alas
not
anybody
seems
to
know
of
such
a
fray
ix
and
they
heed
but
transitory
marketings
in
cheese
and
meat
till
i
judge
that
story
is
extinct
in
street
x
yet
while
here
and
there
they
thrid
them
in
their
zest
to
sell
and
buy
let
me
sit
me
down
amid
them
and
behold
those
thousands
die
xi
a
creature
cares
in
lodi
how
napoleon
swept
each
arch
or
where
up
and
downward
trod
he
or
for
his
memorial
march
xii
so
that
wherefore
should
i
be
here
watching
adda
lip
the
lea
when
the
whole
romance
to
see
here
is
the
dream
i
bring
with
me
xiii
and
why
sing

as
i
sit
thereon
and
swing
when
none
shows
by
smile
or
nod
he
guesses
why
or
what
i
sing
xiv
since
all
lodi
low
and

seem
to
pass
that

it
truly

not

thy

i

a

be
silent
thereupon
xvi
and
if

be
no

the

i

the

are

xvii
nay
sing

romantic

though
none

on
an

the
united
states
i
my
ardours
for
emprize
nigh
lost
since
life
has
bared
its
bones
to
me

shrink
to
seek
a
modern
coast
whose
riper
times
have
yet
to
be
where
the
new
regions
claim
them
free
from
that
long
drip
of
human
tears
which
peoples
old
in
tragedy
have
left
upon
the
centuried
years

enchased

lettered
as
a

scored
with

here
to

with
his
decease

him
out
in

in

which
benumbed
at

by

by

homing

wonder

this

thou

us

our
clay
in
helpless
bondage
thus
to

straightway
to
think
no
more
of
us
that
some
disaster
cleft
thy
scheme

tore
us
wide
apart
so
that
no
cry
can
cross

deem
for
thou
art
mild
of

us
in

that
we
should
win
thy
succour
by
a

thy

down
the

from

cancel

that
land

fulfilled

code
i
saw
in

unbroken
its
history
outwrought

loud
had

down

met
my
bride
her
look
was
pinched
and
thin
as
if
her
soul
had
shrunk
and
died
and
left
a
waste
within
her
reproach
con
the
dead
page
as
live
love
press
on
cold
words
will
ease
thy
track
for
thee
aye
go
cast
off
sweet
ways
and
leave
me
wan
to
biting
blasts
that
are
intent
on
me

if
thy

and
see
how
absence
wears
these

and
dims
these
eyes
it
surely
is
far
sweeter
and
more
wise
to
water
love
than
toil
to
leave
anon
a
name
whose
will

invidious
minds
to

it

over
which

the
inconsistent
i
say
was
as
good
as
fair
when
standing
by
her
mound
passing
sweetness
i
declare
longer
treads
the
i
say
living
love
can
catch
her
bloom
and
bonhomie
and
what
in
newer
maidens
match
her
olden
warmth
to
me
stands
within
yon
where
bonded
lovers
sign
her
name
upon
a
faded
book
with
one
that
is
not
mine
to
him
she
breathed
the
tender
vow
she
once
had
breathed
to
me
but
yet
i
say
love
even
now
would
i
had
died
for
thee
a
broken
appointment
you
did
not
come
and
marching
time
drew
on
and
wore
me
yet
less
for
loss
of
your
dear
presence
there
than
that
i
thus
found
lacking
in
your
make
that
high
compassion
which
can
overbear
reluctance
for
pure
sake
grieved
i
when
as
the
stroked
its
sum
you
did
not
come
you
love
not
me
and
love
alone
can
lend
you
loyalty
know
and
knew
it
but
unto
the
store
of
human
deeds
divine
in
all
but
name
was
it
not
worth
a
little
hour
or
more
to
add
yet
this
once
you
a
woman
came
to
soothe
a
man
even
though
it
be
you
love
not
me
us
between
us
now
and
two
thrown
together
who
are
not
wont
to
wear
flushest
who
see
the
scenes
slide
past
the
daytimes
dimming
fast
let
there
be
truth
at
last
even
if
despair
so
thoroughly
and
long
have
you
now
known
me
so
real
in
faith
and
strong
have
i
now
shown
me
that
nothing
needs
disguise
further
in
any
wise
or
asks
or
justifies
a
guarded
tongue
face
unto
face
then
say
eyes

far
away
or
with
mine
beating
when
false
things
are
brought
low
and
swift
things
have
grown
slow
feigning
like

go

for

my
triolet
how
great
my
grief
my
joys
how
few
since
first
it
was
my
fate
to
know
thee
the
slow
years
not
brought
to

how
great
my
grief
my
joys
how
few
nor
memory
shaped
old
times
anew
nor
helped
to
show
thee
how
great
my
grief

joys
how
few
since
first
it
was
my
fate
to
know
thee
need
not
i
need
not
go
through
sleet
and
snow
to
where
i
know
she
waits
for
me
she
will
wait
me
there
till
i
find
it
fair
and
have
time
to
spare
from
company
when
overgot
the
world
somewhat
when
things
cost
not
such
stress
and
strain
is
soon
enough
by
cypress
sough
to
tell
my
love
i
am
come
again
and
if
some
day
when
none
cries
nay
i
still
delay
to
seek
her
side
though
ample
measure
of
fitting
leisure
await
my
pleasure
she
will
riot
chide
upbraid
me
that
i
delayed
me
nor
ask
what
stayed
me
so
long
ah
no
new
cares
may
claim
me
new
loves
inflame
me
she
will
not
blame
me
but
suffer
it
so
the
coquette
and
after
triolets
i
for
long
the
cruel
wish
i
knew
that
your
free
heart
should
ache
for
me
while
mine
should
bear
no
ache
for
you
for
cruel
wish
knew
how
men
can
feel
and
craved
to
view
my
not
to
be
for
long
the
cruel
wish
i
knew
that
your
free
heart
should
ache
for
me
ii
at
last
one
pays
the
the
always
do
my
farce
i
found
was
tragedy
at
last
pays
the
penalty
with
interest
when
one
learns
love
learns
shame
of
sinners
two
at
last
pays
the
the
always
do
a
spot
in
years
defaced
and
lost
two
sat
here
lit
by
a
living
love
the
wilted
world
knew
nothing
of
scared
momently
by
gaingivings
then
hoping
things
that
could
not
be
of
love
and
us
no

abides
upon
the
place

sun
and
shadows

and

sereward
steal
foul
days
and

too
prevail
and
gust
and

as
everywhere

lonely
shepherd
souls
who
bask
amid
these
knolls
may
catch
a
faery
sound
on
sleepy
noontides
from
the
ground
not
again
till
earth
outwears
shall
love
like
theirs
suffuse
this
glen
long
plighted
is
it
worth
while
dear
now
to
call
for
bells
and
sally
forth
arrayed
for
decried
delayed
so
many
years
is
it
worth
while
dear
now
to
stir
desire
for
old
fond
purposings
by
feints
that
time
still
serves
for
dallyings
though
quittance
nears
is
it
worth
while
dear
when
the
day
being
so
far
spent
so
low
the
sun
the
undone
thing
will
soon
be
as
the
done
and
smiles
as
tears
is
it
worth
while
dear
when
our
cheeks
are
worn
our
early
brown
is
gray
when
meet
or
part
we
none
says
yea
or
nay
or
heeds
or
cares
is
it
worth
while
dear
since
we
still
can
climb
old
wooded
mounds
together
as
each
season
steals
its
rounds
and
disappears
is
it
worth
while
dear
since
as
mates
in
mellstock
churchyard
we
can
lie
till
the
last
crash
of
all
things
low
and
high
shall
end
the
spheres
the
widow
by
mellstock
lodge
and
avenue
towards
her
door
i
went
and
sunset
on
her
reflected
our
intent
the
creeper
on
the
gable
nigh
was
fired
to
more
than
red
and
when
i
came
to
halt
thereby
as
my
joy
i
said
of
late
days
it
had
been
her
aim
to
meet
me
in
the
hall
now
at
my
footsteps
no
one
came
and
no
one
to
my
call
again
i
knocked
and
tardily
an
inner
step
was
heard
and
i
was
shown
her
presence
then
with
scarce
an
answering
word
she
met
me
and
but
barely
took
my
proffered
warm
embrace
preoccupation
weighed
her
look
and
hardened
her
sweet
face
you
call
make
brief
your
present
stay
my
child
is
one
my
all
and
be
left
and
then
she
turns
and
gives
commands
as
i
were
out
of
sound
or
were
no
more
to
her
and
hers
than
any
neighbour
round
maid
i
wooed
her
but
one
came
and
coaxed
her
heart
away
and
when
in
time
he
wedded
her
i
deemed
her
gone
for
aye
he
won
i
lost
her
and
my
loss
i
bore
i
know
not
how
but
i
do
think
i
suffered
then
less
wretchedness
than
now
for
time
in
taking
him
had
oped
an
unexpected
door
of
bliss
for
me
which
grew
to
seem
far
surer
than
before
her
word
is
steadfast
and
i
know
that
plighted
firm
are
we
but
she
has
caught
new
since
she
smiled
as
maid
on
me
at
a
hasty
wedding
triolet
if
hours
be
years
the
twain
are
blest
for
now
they
solace
swift
desire
by
bonds
of
every
bond
the
best
if
hours
be
years
the
twain
are
blest
do
eastern
stars
slope
never
west
nor
pallid
ashes
follow
fire
if
hours
be
years
the
twain
are
blest
for
now
they
solace
swift
desire
the
a
dream
of
mine
flew
over
the
mead
to
the
halls
where
my
old
love
reigns
and
it
drew
me
on
to
follow
its
lead
and
i
stood
at
her
and
i
saw
but
a
thing
of
flesh
and
bone
speeding
on
to
its
cleft
in
the
clay
and
my
dream
was
scared
and
expired
on
a
moan
and
i
whitely
hastened
away
his
immortality
i
i
saw
a
dead
finer
part
shining
within
each
faithful
heart
of
those
bereft
then
said
i
must
be
his
ii
i
looked
there
as
the
seasons
wore
and
still
his
soul
continuously
upbore
its
life
in
theirs
but
less
its
shine
excelled
than
when
i
first
beheld
iii
his
passed
and
then
in
later
hearts
i
looked
for
him
again
and
found
alas
into
a
thin
and
spectral
mannikin
iv
lastly
i
old
and
if
aught
of
him
remain
unperished
still
and
find
in
me
alone
a
feeble
spark
dying
amid
the
dark
the
i
i
heard
a
small
sad
sound
and
stood
awhile
amid
the
tombs
around
old
friends
said
i
ye
distrest
now
screened
from
unrest
ii
not
at
being
here
but
that
our
future
second
death
is
drear
when
with
the
living
memory
of
us
numbs
and
blank
oblivion
comes
iii
who
our
grandsires
be
lie
here
embraced
by
deeper
death
than
we
nor
shape
nor
thought
of
theirs
canst
thou
descry
with
keenest
backward
eye
iv
bide
as
quite
forgot
they
are
as
men
who
have
existed
not
theirs

a
loss
past
loss
of
fitful
breath
it
is
the
second
death

to

in

never

chrysanthemum
why
should
this
flower
delay
so
long
to
show
its
tremulous
plumes
now
is
the
time
of
plaintive
when
flowers
are
in
their
tombs
through
the
slow
summer
when
the
sun
called
to
each
frond
and
whorl
that
all
he
could
for
flowers
was
being
done
why
did
it
not
uncurl
it
must
have
felt
that
fervid
call
although
it
took
no
heed
waking
but
now
when
leaves
like
corpses
fall
and
saps
all
retrocede
too
late
its
beauty
lonely
thing
the
shine
is
spent
nothing
remains
for
it
but
shivering
in
tempests
turbulent
had
it
a
reason
for
delay
dreaming
in
witlessness
that
for
a
bloom
so
delicately
gay
winter
would
stay
its
stress
talk
as
if
the
thing
were
born
with
sense
to
work
its
mind
yet
it
is
but
one
mask
of
many
worn
by
the
great
face
behind
the
darkling
thrush
i
leant
upon
a
coppice
gate
when
frost
was
and
dregs
made
desolate
the
weakening
eye
of
day
the
tangled
scored
the
sky
like
strings
from
broken
lyres
and
all
mankind
that
haunted
nigh
had
sought
their
household
fires
the
sharp
features
seemed
to
be
the
corpse
outleant
his
crypt
the
cloudy
canopy
the
wind
his
the
ancient
pulse
of
germ
and
birth
was
shrunken
hard
and
dry
and
every
spirit
upon
earth
seemed
fervourless
as
i
at
once
a
voice
outburst
among
the
bleak
twigs
overhead
in
a
evensong
of
joy
illimited
an
aged
thrush
frail
gaunt
and
small
in
plume
had
chosen
thus
to
fling
his
soul
upon
the
growing
gloom
so
little
cause
for
carollings
of
such
ecstatic
sound
was
written
on
terrestrial
things
afar
or
nigh
around
that
i
could
think
there
trembled
through
his
happy
air
some
blessed
hope
whereof
he
knew
and
i
was
unaware
the
comet
at
yalbury
or
i
it
bends
far
over
plain
and
we
from
height
stand
and
regard
its
fiery
train
so
soon
to
swim
from
sight
ii
it
will
return
long
years
hence
when
as
now
its
strange
swift
shine
will
fall
on
but
not
then
on
that
sweet
form
of
thine
mad
judy
when
the
hamlet
hailed
a
birth
judy
used
to
cry
when
she
heard
our
christening
mirth
she
would
kneel
and
sigh
she
was
crazed
we
knew
and
we
humoured
her
infirmity
when
the
daughters
and
the
sons
gathered
them
to
wed
and
we
ones
danced
till
dawn
was
red
she
would
rock
and
mutter
comers
to
this
stony
shore
when
old

death
laid
hands
on
a
babe
or
twain
she
would
feast
and
by
her
brands
sing
her
songs
again
what
she
liked
we
let
her
do
judy
was
insane
we
knew
a
wasted
illness
through
vaults
of
pain
enribbed
and
wrought
with
groins
of
ghastliness
i
passed
and
garish
spectres
moved
my
brain
to
dire
distress
and
hammerings
and
quakes
and
shoots
and
stifling
hotness
blent
with
webby
waxing
things
and
waning
things
as
on
i
went
lies
the
end
to
this
foul
way
i
asked
with
weakening
breath
thereon
ahead
i
saw
a
door
the
door
to
death
it
loomed
more
clear
last
i
cried
door
and
then
i
knew
not
how
it
grew
less
near
than
theretofore
and
back
slid
i
along
the
galleries
by
which
i
came
and
tediously
the
day
returned
and
sky
and
same
and
all
was
well
old
circumstance
resumed
its
former
show
and
on
my
head
the
dews
of
comfort
fell
as
ere
my
woe
i
roam
anew
scarce
conscious
of
my
late
distress
and
yet
those
backward
steps
through
pain
i
can
not
view
without
regret
for
that
dire
train
of
waxing
shapes
and
waning
passed
before
and
those
grim
aisles
must
be
traversed
again
to
reach
that
door
a
man
in
memory
of
of
i
in
casterbridge
there
stood
a
noble
pile
wrought
with
pilaster
bay
and
balustrade
in
tactful
times
when
shrewd
eliza
on
burgher
squire
and
clown
it
smiled
the
long
street
down
for
near
a
mile
ii
but
evil
days
beset
that
domicile
the
stately
beauties
of
its
roof
and
wall
passed
into
sordid
hands
condemned
to
fall
were
cornice
quoin
and
cove
and
all
that
art
had
wove
in
antique
style
iii
among
the
hired
dismantlers
entered
there
one
till
the
moment
of
his
task
untold
when
charged
therewith
he
gazed
and
answered
bold
needy
i
or
no
i
will
not
help
lay
low
a
house
so
fair
iv
is
hard
but
since
the
terms
be
no
wage
or
labour
stained
with
the
disgrace
of
wrecking
what
our
age
can
not
replace
to
save
its
tasteless
do
without
your
dole
life
is
not
much
v
dismissed
with
sneers
he
backed
his
tools
and
went
and
wandered
workless
for
it
seemed
unwise
to
close
with
one
who
dared
to
criticize
and
carp
on
points
of
taste
to
work
where
they
were
placed
rude
men
were
meant
vi
years
whiled
he
aged
sank
sickened
and
was
not
and
it
was
said
man
intractable
and
curst
is
none
sighed
to
hear
his
knell
none
sought
his
his
name
his
rugged
face
were
soon
forgot
vii
the
stones
of
that
fair
hall
lie
far
and
wide
and
but
a
few
recall
its
ancient
mould
yet
when
i
pass
the
spot
i
long
to
hold
as
truth
what
fancy
saith

where
deathless
things
abide
the
dame
of
athelhall

shall
i
see
thy
face
she
said
one
brief
hour
and
away
with
thee
from
a
loveless
bed
to
a
sun
to
a
bower
and
be
thine
own
unseparated
and
challenge
the
white
glower
ii
she
quickened
her
feet
and
met
him
where
they
had
predesigned
and
they
clasped
and
mounted
and
cleft
the
air
upon
whirling
wheels
till
the
will
to
bind
her
life
with
his
made
the
moments
there
efface
the
years
behind
iii
miles
slid
and
the
sight
of
the
port
upgrew
as
they
sped
on
when
slipping
its
bond
the
bracelet
flew
from
her
fondled
arm
replaced
anon
its
cameo
of
the
abjured
one
drew
her
musings
thereupon
iv
the
gaud
with
his
image
once
had
been
a
gift
from
him
and
so
it
was
that
its
carving
keen
refurbished
memories
wearing
dim
which
set
in
her
soul
a
throe
of
teen
and
a
tear
on
her
brim
v
may
not
go
she
at
length
upspake
call
me
i
would
still
lose
all
for
your
dear
dear
sake
my
heart
is
thine
friend
but
my
track
i
home
to
athelhall
must
take
to
hinder
household
wrack
vi
he
appealed
but
they
parted
weak
and
wan
and
he
left
the
shore
his
ship
diminished
was
low
was
gone
and
she
heard
in
the
waves
as
the
daytide
wore
and
read
in
the
leer
of
the
sun
that
shone
that
they
parted
for
evermore

she
came
at
the
dip
of
eve
on
athel
coomb
regaining
the
hall
she
had
sworn
to
leave
the
house
was
soundless
as
a
tomb
and
she
entered
her
chamber
there
to
grieve
lone
kneeling
in
the
gloom
viii
from
the
lawn
without
rose
her
voice
to

it

bygone
be

no

she
has
crossed
the
tide
with
the
man
to
her
mind
far
happier
she
in
some
warm
vineland
by
his
side
than
ever
she
was
with
the
seasons
of
her
year
i
winter
is
white
on

and

and
birds
are
fled
but
summer
songsters
pipe
to
me
and
petals
spread
for
what
i
dreamt
of
secretly
his
lips
have
said
ii
o
a
fine
may
morn
they
say
and
blooms
have
blown
but
wild
and
wintry
is
my
day
my
birds
make
moan
for
he
who
vowed
leaves
me
to
pay
the
milkmaid
under
a
daisied
bank
there
stands
a
rich
red
ruminating
cow
and
hard
against
her
flank
a
milkmaid
bends
her
brow
the
flowery
upheaves
and
falls
the
milk
purrs
in
the
pail
few
pilgrims
but
would
choose
the
peace
of
such
a
life
in
such
a
vale
the
maid
breathes
vent
it
seems
her
sense
of
scenery
of
whose
life
sentiment
and
essence
very
part
itself
is
she
she
bends
a
glance
of
pain
and
at
a
moment
lets
escape
a
tear
is
it
that
passing
train
whose
alien
whirr
offends
her
country
ear
nay
phyllis
does
not
dwell
on
visual
and
familiar
things
like
these
what
moves
her
is
the
spell
of
inner
themes
and
inner
poetries
could
but
by
sunday
morn
her
gay
new
gown
come

might
dry

shriek
till

such

us
in

up

bewitched
by
your
delicate

there

so
true

unreasoning
why
such

strangers

as

avow
no

it

ye

have
shined
on
nobler
ones

they
are
dead
men
out
of

the
experiment
it
was
a
wet
wan
hour
in
spring
and
nature
met
king
doom
beside
a
lane
wherein
hodge
trudged
all
blithely
ballading
the
smiling
reign
warbles
he
that
skies
are
fair
and
coombs
alight
she
cried
fallows
gay
when
i
have
placed
no
sunshine
in
the
air
or
glow
on
earth
in
the
comedy
of
things
that
such
should
be
returned
the
one
of
doom
now
the
scene
with
brightest
blazonings
and
he
shall
call
them
she
gave
the
word
the
sun
outbroke
all
froomside
shone
the
hedgebirds
raised
a
song
and
later
hodge
upon
the
midday
stroke
returned
the
lane
along
low
murmuring
this
bitter
scene
and
thrice
accurst
horizon
hung
with
gloom
how
deadly
like
this
sky
these
fields
these
treen
to
trappings
of
the
tomb
the
beldame
then
fool
and
blind
such
mad
perverseness
who
may
apprehend
no
madness
in
it
thou
shalt
find
thy
law
there
said
her
friend
hodge
went
forth
to
his
love
to
make
her
ere
this
eve
his
wedded
prize
and
earth
despite
the
heaviness
above
was
bright
as
paradise
i
sent
on
my
messenger
with
cunning
arrows
poisonous
and
keen
to
take
forthwith
her
laughing
life
from
her
and
dull
her
little
een
white
her
cheek
and
still
her
breath
ere
her
too
buoyant
hodge
had
reached
her
side
so
when
he
came
he
clasped
her
but
in
death
and
never
as
his
bride
the
humour
as
i
said
thy
dreary
dawn
he
saw
as
gleaming
gold
and
in
thy
glistening
green
and
radiant
red
funereal
gloom
and
the
tree
an
old
story
i
its
roots
are
bristling
in
the
air
like
some
mad
spiny
hair
the
loud
swell
and
yell
smote
it
at
midnight
and
it
fell
thus
ends
the
tree
where
some
one
sat
with
me
ii
its
boughs
which
none
but
darers
trod
a
child
may
step
on
from
the
sod
and
twigs
that
earliest
met
the
dawn
are
lit
the
last
upon
the
lawn
cart
off
the
tree
beneath
whose
trunk
sat
we

yes
there
we
sat
she
cooed
content
and
bats
ringed
round
and
daylight
went
the
gnarl
our
seat
is
wrenched
and
sunk
prone
that
queer
pocket
in
the
trunk
where
lay
the
key
to
her
pale
mystery
iv
back
within
this
i
found
my
love
a
hurried
scrawl
meant
not
for
me
at
length
said
i
glanced
thereat
and
let
it
lie
the
words
were
v
placed
it
here
to
what
request
it
gave
assent
i
never
guessed
some
prayer
of
some
hot
heart
no
doubt
to
some
coy
maiden
hereabout
just
as
maybe
with
you
sweet
heart
and
vi
she
waited
till
with
quickened
breath
she
spoke
as
one
who
banisheth
reserves
that
lovecraft
heeds
so
well
to
ease
some
mighty
wish
to
tell
i
said
she
wrote
thus
clinchingly

wife
nought
of
what
we
felt
and
bore
and
thought
said
wed
with
thee
or
stands
thou
shalt

i
held
back
how
love
supreme
involved
me
madly
in
his
scheme
why
should
i
say
i
wrote
assent
you
found
it
hid
to
his
intent
but
he
came
not
to
wed
with
me
ix
shrink
not

these
eyes
seen
but
once
thine
own
such
had
not
been

we
were
strangers

cleared

the

into

glowing
in
gladsome
faith

i
quickened
the

thereby

on

of

afar

stood

a

me
the
smallest
and
feeblest
of

there
weak
from

here
at

on

dangling
in
mockery
of
what
he
spent
his
substance
on
blindly
and
uselessly
might

built

the
lost

a
mediæval
legend
some
say
the
spot
is
banned
that
the
pillar
attests
to
a
deed
of
hell
but
of
else
than
of
bale
is
the
mystic
tale
that
ancient
tell
ere
abbey
ceased
hereabout
there
dwelt
a
priest
in
later
life
of
the
brotherhood
there
whose
bones
are
now
bare
in
the
field
that
was
cernel
choir
one
night
in
his
cell
at
the
foot
of
yon
dell
the
priest
heard
a
frequent
cry
father
in
haste
to
the
cot
on
the
waste
and
shrive
a
man
waiting
to
said
the
priest
in
a
shout
to
the
caller
without
night
howls
the
bow
one
may
barely
by
day
track
so
rugged
a
way
and
can
i
then
do
so
now
no
further
word
from
the
dark
was
heard
and
the
priest
moved
never
a
limb
and
he
slept
and
dreamed
till
a
visage
seemed
to
frown
from
heaven
at
him
in
a
sweat
he
arose
and
the
storm
shrieked
shrill
and
smote
as
in
savage
joy
while
trees
twanged
to
hill
and
to
there
seemed
not
a
holy
thing
in
hail
nor
shape
of
light
or
love
from
the
abbey
north
of
blackmore
vale
to
the
abbey
south
thereof
yet
he
plodded
thence
through
the
dark
immense
and
with
many
a
stumbling
stride
through
copse
and
briar
climbed
nigh
and
nigher
to
the
cot
and
the
sick
side
when
he
would
have
unslung
the
vessels
uphung
to
his
arm
in
the
steep
ascent
he
made
loud
moan
the
pyx
was
gone
of
the
blessed
sacrament
then
in
dolorous
dread
he
beat
his
head
earthly
prize
or
pelf
is
the
thing
lost
in
tempest
tossed
but
the
body
of
christ
himself
he
thought
of
the
visage
his
dream
revealed
and
turned
towards
whence
he
came
hands
groping
the
ground
along
and
field
and
head
in
a
heat
of
shame
till
here
on
the
hill
betwixt
vill
and
vill
he
noted
a
clear
straight
ray
stretching
down
from
the
sky
to
a
spot
hard
by
which
shone
with
the
light
of
day
and
gathered
around
the
illumined
ground
were
common
beasts
and
rare
all
kneeling
at
gaze
and
in
pause
profound
attent
on
an
object
there
the
pyx
unharmed
the
circling
rows
of
hairy
throng
whereof
were
oxen
sheep
and
does
and
hares
from
the
brakes
among
and
badgers
grey
and
conies
keen
and
squirrels
of
the
tree
and
many
a
member
seldom
seen
of
family
the
ireful
winds
that
scoured
and
swept
through
coppice
clump
and
dell
within
that
holy
circle
slept
calm
as
in
cell
then
the
priest
bent
likewise
to
the
sod
and
thanked
the
lord
of
love
and
blessed
mary
mother
of
god
and
all
the
saints
above
and
turning
straight
with
his
priceless
freight
he
reached
the
dying
one
whose
passing
sprite
had
been
stayed
for
the
rite
without
which
bliss
hath
none
and
when
by
grace
the
priest
won
place
and
served
the
abbey
well
he
reared
this
stone
to
mark
where
shone
that
midnight
miracle
lament
i
i
would
that
folk
forgot
me
quite
forgot
me

could

my
nook

have
lived
with
shades
so
long

talked
to
them
so
oft
since
forth
from
cot
and
croft
i
went
mankind
among
that
sometimes
they
in
their
dim
style
will
pause
awhile
to
hear
my
say
ii
and
take
me
by
the
hand
and
lead
me
through
their
rooms
in
the
where
dooms
and
shapeless
stand
and
show
from
there
the
dwindled
dust
and
rot
and
rust
of
things
that
were
iii
turn
spake
they
to
me
one
day
whence
we
came
and

name

gazes
thence

said
man
so
commonplace

me
not
at
all

no
ray
or

of

deep
pain
alas
would
be
his
name
to
thee
and
told
in
vain
memory
and
i
memory
where
is
now
my
youth
who
used
to
say
that
life
was
truth
saw
him
in
a
crumbled
cot
beneath
a
tottering
tree
that
he
as
phantom
lingers
there
is
only
known
to
memory
where
is
now
my
joy
who
lived
with
me
in
sweet
employ
saw
him
in
gaunt
gardens
lone
where
laughter
used
to
be
that
he
as
phantom
wanders
there
is
known
to
none
but
memory
where
is
now
my
hope
who
charged
with
deeds
my
skill
and
scope
saw
her
in
a
tomb
of
tomes
where
dreams
are
wont
to
be
that
she
as
spectre
haunteth
there
is
only
known
to
memory
where
is
now
my
faith
one
time
a
champion
now
a
wraith
saw
her
in
a
ravaged
aisle
bowed
down
on
bended
knee
that
her
poor
ghost
outflickers
there
is
known
to
none
but
memory
where
is
now
my
love
that
rayed
me
as
a
god
above
saw
him
by
an
ageing
shape
where
beauty
used
to
be
that
his
fond
phantom
lingers
there
is
