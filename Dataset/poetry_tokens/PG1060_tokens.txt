the
years
will
pass
and
hearts
will
range
conquer
time
and
care
and
change
though
time
doth
still
delight
to
shed
the
dust
on
many
a
younger
head
though
care
oft
coming
hath
the
guile
from
younger
lips
to
steal
the
smile
though
change
makes
younger
hearts
wax
cold
and
sells
new
loves
for
loves
of
old
time
change
nor
care
hath
learned
the
art
to
fleck
your
hair
to
chill
your
heart
to
touch
your
tresses
with
the
snow
to
mar
your
mirth
of
long
ago
change
care
nor
time
while
life
endure
shall
spoil
our
ancient
friendship
sure
the
love
which
flows
from
sacred
springs
in
unhappy
things
from
sympathies
in
grief
and
joy
through
all
the
years
of
man
and
boy
therefore
to
you
the
rhymes
i
strung
when
even
this
head
was
young
i
bring
and
later
rhymes
i
bring
that
flit
upon
as
weak
a
wing
but
still
for
you
for
yours
they
sing
many
of
the
verses
and
translations
in
this
volume
were
published
first
in
and
lyrics
of
old
though
very
sensible
that
they
have
the
demerits
of
imitative
and
even
of
undergraduate
rhyme
i
print
them
again
because
people
i
like
have
liked
them
the
rest
are
of
different
dates
and
lack
though
doubtless
they
need
the
excuse
of
having
been
written
like
some
of
the
earlier
pieces
during
college
lectures
i
would
gladly
have
added
to
this
volume
what
other
more
or
less
serious
rhymes
i
have
written
but
circumstances
over
which
i
have
no
control
have
bound
them
up
with
and
other
toys
of
that
sort
it
may
be
as

i

they
differ
not
from
yours
and
mine
one
man
we
knew
and
only
one
whose
seeking
for
a
done
for
what
he
greatly
sought
he
found
a
city
girt
with
fire
around
a
city
in
an
empty
land
between
the
wastes
of
sky
and
sand
a
city
on
a
where
by
the
folk
he
loved
he
died
alas
it
is
not
ours
to
tread
that
path
wherein
his
life
he
led
not
ours
his
heart
to
dare
and
feel
keen
as
the
fragrant
syrian
steel
yet
are
we
not
quite
not
wholly
left
in
our
is
it
not
said
by
one
of
old
have
i
of
another
ah
faint
of
heart
and
weak
of
will
for
us
there
is
a
city
still

the
stoic
says
the
voice
from
imperial
days
thee
meet
all
me
fruit
thy
seasons
thy
summer
and
thy
winds
that
suns
that
thee
thee
city
of
shall
not
say
home
to
which
none
can
lose
the
way
born
in
that
flaming
bound
we
do
not
find
her
but
are
found
within
her
wide
and
viewless
wall
the
universe
is
girdled
all
all
joys
and
pains
all
wealth
and
dearth
all
things
that
travail
on
the
earth
will
they
work
if
god
there
be
if
not
what
is
my
life
to
me
seek
we
no
further
but
abide
within
this
city
great
and
wide
in
her
and
for
her
living
we
have
no
less
joy
than
to
be
free
nor
death
nor
grief
can
quite
appal
the
folk
that
dwell
within
her
wall
nor
aught
but
with
our
will
befall
the
white
pacha
vain
is
the
dream
however
hope
may
rave
he
perished
with
the
folk
he
could
not
save
and
though
none
surely
told
us
he
is
dead
and
though
perchance
another
in
his
stead
another
not
less
brave
when
all
was
done
had
fled
unto
the
southward
and
the
sun
had
urged
a
way
by
force
or
won
by
guile
to
streams
remotest
of
the
secret
nile
had
raised
an
army
of
the
desert
men
and
waiting
for
his
hour
had
turned
again
and
fallen
on
that
false
prophet
yet
we
know
gordon
is
dead
and
these
things
are
not
so
nay
not
for
cause
nor
to
restore
her
trampled
he
loved
honour
nay
not
for
life
revenge
or
victory
would
he
have
fled
whose
hour
had
dawned
to
die
he
will
not
come
again
our
need
he
will
not
come
who
is
happy
being
freed
from
the
deathly
flesh
and
perishable
things
and
lies
of
statesmen
and
rewards
of
kings
nay
somewhere
by
the
sacred
shore
he
sleeps
like
those
who
shall
return
no
more
no
more
return
for
all
the
prayers
of
arthur
and
never
come
again
they
shall
not
wake
though
fair
the
vision
seem
sick

may
whisper
vain
the
dream
midnight
january
is
a
year
since
gordon
died
a
year
ago
the
desert
still
crouched
on
the
spring
and
panted
for
its
fill
of
lust
and
blood
their
old
art

plied
and
paltered
and
evaded
and
denied
guiltless
as

for
feeble
will
and
craven
heart
and

skill
in
long
delays
of
their
great
homicide
a
year
ago
not
too
late
the
thought
comes
through
our
mirth
again
again
methinks
i
hear
the
halting
foot
of
fate
approaching
and
approaching
us
and
then
comes
cackle

thou
that
on
every
field
of
earth
and
sky
didst
hunt
for
death
who
seemed
to
flee
and
fear
how
great
and
greatly
fallen
dost
thou
lie
slain
in
the
desert
by
some
wandering
spear
here
alas
may
england
say
here
nor
in
this
quarrel
was
it
meet
to
die
but
in
that
dreadful
battle
drawing
nigh
to
thunder
through
the
afghan
passes
sheer
like
aias
by
the
ships
shouldst
thou
have
stood
and
in
some
glen
have
stayed
the
stream
of
flight
the
bulwark
of
thy
people
and
their
shield
when
indus
or
when
helmund
ran
with
blood
till
back
into
the
northland
and
the
night
the
smitten
eagles
scattered
from
the
melville
and
coghill
the
place
of
the
little
hand
dead
with
their
eyes
to
the
foe
dead
with
the
foe
at
their
feet
under
the
sky
laid
low
truly
their
slumber
is
sweet
though
the
wind
from
the
camp
of
the
slain
men
blow
and
the
rain
on
the
wilderness
beat
dead
for
they
chose
to
die
when
that
wild
race
was
run
dead
for
they
would
not
fly
deeming
their
work
undone
nor
cared
to
look
on
the
face
of
the
sky
nor
loved
the
light
of
the
sun
honour
we
give
them
and
tears
and
the
flag
they
died
to
save
rent
from
the
rain
of
the
spears
wet
from
the
war
and
the
wave
shall
waft
thoughts
through
the
dust
of

rhodocleia
to
rhodocleia
on
her
melancholy
singing
rhodocleia
was
beloved
by
rufinus
one
of
the
late
poets
of
the
greek
anthology
still
rhodocleia
brooding
on
the
dead
still
singing
of
the
meads
of
asphodel
lands
desolate
of
delight
say
hast
thou
dreamed
of
or
rememberèd
the
shores
where
shadows
dwell
nor
know
the
sun
nor
see
the
stars
of
night
there
thy
music
doth
thy
spirit
gaze
as
a
girl
pines
for
home
looking
along
the
way
that
she
hath
come
sick
to
return
and
counts
the
weary
days
so
wouldst
thou
flee
back
to
the
multitude
whose
days
are
done
wouldst
taste
the
fruit
that
lured
persephone
the
sacrament
of
death
and
die
and
be
no
more
in
the
wind
and
sun
thou
hast
not
dreamed
it
but
rememberèd
i
know
thou
hast
been
there
hast
seen
the
stately
dwellings
of
the
dead
rise
in
the
twilight
air
and
crossed
the
shadowy
bridge
the
spirits
tread
and
climbed
the
golden
stair
nay
by
thy
cloudy
hair
and
lips
that
were
so
fair
sad
lips
now
mindful
of
some
ancient
smart
and
melancholy
eyes
the
haunt
of
care
i
know
thee
who
thou
art
that
rhodocleia
glory
of
the
rose
of
hellas
ere
her
close
that
rhodocleia
who
when
all
was
done
the
golden
time
of
greece
and
fallen
her
sun
swayed
her
last
heart
with
roses
did
he
woo
thee
and
with
song
with
thine
own
rose
and
with
the
lily
sweet
the
violet
garlands
of
wet
and
fragrant
that
the
whole
night
long
burned
till
the
dawn
was
burning
in
the
skies
praising
golden
feet
more
silvery
than
but
thou
didst
die
and
flit
among
the
tribes
outworn
the
unavailing
myriads
of
the
past
oft
he
beheld
thy
face
in
dreams
of
morn
and
waking
wept
for
it
till
his
own
time
came
at
last
and
then
he
sought
thee
in
the
dusky
land
wide
are
the
populous
places
of
the
dead
where
souls
on
earth
once
wed
may
never
meet
nor
each
take
hand
each
far
from
the
other
fled
so
all
in
vain
he
sought
for
thee
but
thou
didst
never
taste
of
the
lethæan
stream
nor
that
forgetful
fruit
the
mystic
but
from
the
mighty
warden
fledst
and
now
the
fugitive
of
fate
thou
farest
in
our
life
as
in
a
dream
still
wandering
with
thy
lute
like
that
sweet
paynim
lady
of
old
song
who
sang
and
wandered
long
for
love
of
her
aucassin
seeking
him
so
with
thy
minstrelsy
thou
roamest
dreaming
of
the
country
dim
below
the
veilèd
sky
there
doth
thy
lover
dwell
singing
and
seeking
still
to
find
thy
face
in
that
forgetful
place
thou
shalt
not
meet
him
here
not
till
thy
singing
clear
through
all
the
murmur
of
the
streams
of
hell
wins
to
the
ear
may
she
perchance
have
pity
on
thee
and
call
thine
eager
spirit
to
sit
beside
her
feet
passing
throughout
the
long
unechoing
hall
up
to
the
shadowy
throne
where
the
lost
lovers
of
the
ages
meet
till
then
thou
art
alone

the

were
one
beside

ocean
dim
i
count
the
years
passed
over

the

me
looked
on

that
save

to
quiet
tears
like
a
loved
ghost
thy
fabled
flood
fleets
through
the
dusky
land
where
scott
come
home
to
die
has
stood
my
feet
returning
stand
a
mist
of
memory
broods
and
floats
the
border
waters
flow
the
air
is
full
of
ballad
notes
borne
out
of
long
ago
old
songs
that
sung
themselves
to
me
sweet
through
a
day
dream
while
trout
below
the
tree
plashed
in
the
golden
steam
twilight
and
tweed
and
eildon
hill
fair
and
too
fair
you
be
you
tell
me
that
the
voice
is
still
that
should
have
welcomed
me
metempsychosis
i
shall
not
see
thee
nay
but
i
shall
know
perchance
the
grey
eyes
in
eyes
shall
guess
thy
curls
in
gracious
locks
that
flow
on
purest
brows
yea
and
the
swift
surmise
shall
follow
and
track
and
find
thee
in
disguise
of
all
sad
things
and
fair
where
sunsets
glow
when
through
the
scent
of
heather
faint
and
low
the
weak
wind
whispers
to
the
day
that
dies
from
all
sweet
art
and
out
of
all
old
rhyme
thine
eyes
and
lips
are
light
and
song
to
me
the
shadows
of
the
beauty
of
all
time
in
song
or
story
are
but
shapes
of
thee
alas
the
shadowy
shapes
ah
sweet
my
dear
shall
life
or
death
bring
all
thy
being
near
lost
in
hades
i
dreamed
that
somewhere
in
the
shadowy
place
grief
of
farewell
unspoken
was
forgot
in
welcome
and
regret
remembered
not
and
hopeless
prayer
accomplished
turned
to
praise
on
lips
that
had
been
songless
many
days
hope
had
no
more
to
hope
for
and
desire
and
dread
were
overpast
in
white
attire
new
born
we
walked
among
the
new
ways
then
from
the
press
of
shades
a
spirit
threw
towards
me
such
apples
as
these
gardens
bear
and
turning
i
was
of
her
and
knew
and
followed
her
fleet
voice
and
flying
hair
followed
and
found
her
not
and
seeking
you
i
found
you
never
dearest
anywhere
a
star
in
the
night
the
perfect
piteous
beauty
of
thy
face
is
like
a
star
the
dawning
drives
away
mine
eyes
may
never
see
in
the
bright
day
thy
pallid
halo
thy
supernal
grace
but
in
the
night
from
forth
the
silent
place
thou
comest
dim
in
dreams
as
doth
a
stray
star
of
the
starry
flock
that
in
the
grey
is
seen
and
lost
and
seen
a
space
and
as
the
earth
at
night
turns
to
a
star
loved
long
ago
and
dearer
than
the
sun
so
in
the
spiritual
place
afar
at
night
our
souls
are
mingled
and
made
one
and
wait
till
one
night
fall
and
one
dawn
rise
that
brings
no
noon
too
splendid
for
your
eyes
a
sunset
on
yarrow
the
wind
and
the
day
had
lived
together
they
died
together
and
far
away
spoke
farewell
in
the
sultry
weather
out
of
the
sunset
over
the
heather
the
dying
wind
and
the
dying
day
far
in
the
south
the
summer
levin
flushed
a
flame
in
the
grey
soft
air
we
seemed
to
look
on
the
hills
of
heaven
you
saw
within
but
to
me
given
to
see
your
face
as
an
there
never
again
ah
surely
never
shall
we
wait
and
watch
where
of
old
we
stood
the
low
of
the
hill
and
the
river
the
faint
light
fade
and
the
wan
stars
quiver
twain
grown
one
in
the
solitude
another
way
to
me
in
my
shall
be
well
then
the
night
will
more
than
hopeless
longing
of
the
nay
come
not
in
dreams
my
sweet
with
shadowy
robes
and
silent
feet
and
with
the
voice
and
with
the
eyes
that
greet
me
in
a
soft
surprise
last
night
last
night
in
dreams
we
met
and
how
shall
i
forget
or
how
remembering
restrain
mine
incommunicable
pain
nay
where
thy
land
and
people
are
dwell
thou
remote
apart
afar
nor
mingle
with
the
shapes
that
sweep
the
melancholy
ways
of
sleep
but
if
perchance
the
shadows
break
if
dreams
depart
and
men
awake
if
face
to
face
at
length
we
see
be
thine
the
voice
to
welcome
me
hesperothen
by
the
example
of
certain
grecian
mariners
who
being
safely
returned
from
the
war
about
troy
leave
yet
again
their
old
lands
and
gods
seeking
they
know
not
what
and
choosing
neither
to
abide
in
the
fair
phæacian
island
nor
to
dwell
and
die
with
the
sirens
at
length
end
miserably
in
a
desert
country
by
the
sea
is
set
forth
the
of
and
by
the
land
of
phæacia
is
to
be
understood
the
place
of
art
and
of
fair
pleasures
and
by
isle
the
place
of
bodily
delights
whereof
men
falling
aweary
attain
to
eld
and
to
the
darkness
of
that
age
which
thing
master
françoys
rabelais
feigned
under
the
similitude
of
the
isle
of
the
macræones
the
seekers
for
phæacia
there
is
a
land
in
the
remotest
day
where
the
soft
night
is
born
and
sunset
dies
the
eastern
shore
sees
faint
tides
fade
away
that
wash
the
lands
where
laughter
tears
and
sighs
make
life
lands
below
the
blue
of
common
skies
but
in
the
west
is
a
mysterious
sea
what
sails
have
seen
it
or
what
shipmen
known
with
coasts
enchanted
where
the
sirens
be
with
islands
where
a
goddess
walks
alone
and
in
the
cedar
trees
the
magic
winds
make
moan
eastward
the
human
cares
of
house
and
home
cities
and
ships
and
unknown
gods
and
loves
westward
strange
maidens
fairer
than
the
foam
and
lawless
lives
of
men
and
haunted
groves
wherein
a
god
may
dwell
and
where
the
dryad
roves
the
gods
are
careless
of
the
days
and
death
of
toilsome
men
beyond
the
western
seas
the
gods
are
heedless
of
their
painful
breath
and
love
them
not
for
they
are
not
as
these
but
in
the
golden
west
they
live
and
lie
at
ease
yet
the
phæacians
well
they
love
who
live
at
the
limit
passing
careless
hours
most
like
the
gods
and
they
have
gifts
to
give
even
wine
and
fountains
musical
and
flowers
and
song
and
if
they
will
swift
ships
and
magic
powers
it
is
a
quiet
midland
in
the
cool
of
the
twilight
comes
the
god
though
no
man
prayed
to
watch
the
maids
and
young
men
beautiful
dance
and
they
see
him
and
are
not
afraid
for
they
are
neat
of
kin
to
gods
and
undismayed
ah
would
the
bright
red
prows
might
bring
us
nigh
the
dreamy
isles
that
the
immortals
keep
but
with
a
mist
they
hide
them
wondrously
and
far
the
path
and
dim
to
where
they
sleep
the
loved
the
shadowy
lands
along
the
shadowy
deep
a
song
of
phæacia
the
languid
sunset
mother
of
roses
lingers
a
light
on
the
magic
seas
the
wide
fire
flames
as
a
flower
uncloses
heavy
with
odour
and
loose
to
the
breeze
the
red
rose
clouds
without
law
or
leader
gather
and
float
in
the
airy
plain
the
nightingale
sings
to
the
dewy
cedar
the
cedar
scatters
his
scent
to
the
main
the
strange
perfume
turns
to
singing
heard
afar
over
moonlit
seas
the
song
grown
faint
in
winging
falls
in
scent
on
the
cedar
trees
as
waifs
blown
out
of
the
sunset
flying
purple
and
rosy
and
grey
the
birds
brighten
the
air
with
their
wings
their
crying
wakens
a
moment
the
weary
herds
butterflies
flit
from
the
fairy
garden
living
blossoms
of
flying
flowers
never
the
nights
with
winter
harden
nor
moons
wax
keen
in
this
land
of
ours
great
fruits
fragrant
green
and
golden
gleam
in
the
green
and
droop
and
fall
blossom
and
bud
and
flower
unfolden
swing
and
cling
to
the
garden
wall
deep
in
the
woods
as
twilight
darkens
glades
are
red
with
the
scented
fire
far
in
the
dells
the
white
maid
hearkens
song
and
sigh
of
the
desire
ah
and
as
moonlight
fades
in
morning
song
in
the
matin
grey
faints
as
the
first
note
a
warning
wakes
and
wails
to
the
day
the
waking
song
and
the
dying
measure
meet
and
the
waxing
and
waning
light
meet
and
faint
with
the
hours
of
pleasure
the
rose
of
the

and
the
sky
is
white
the
departure
from
phæacia
the
phæacians
why
from
the
dreamy
meadows
more
fair
than
any
dream
why
seek
ye
for
the
shadows
beyond
the
ocean
stream
through
straits
of
storm
and
peril
through
firths
unsailed
before
why
make
you
for
the
sterile
the
dark
kimmerian
shore
there
no
bright
streams
are
flowing
there
day
and

are
one
no
harvest
time
no
sowing
no
sight
of
any
sun
no
sound
of
song
or

no
dance
shall
greet
you
there
no
noise
of
mortal
labour
breaks
on
the
blind
chill
air
are
ours
not
happy
places
where
gods
with
mortals
trod
saw
not
our
sires
the
faces
of
many
a
present
god
the
seekers
nay
now
no
god
comes
hither
in
shape
that
men
may

they
fare
we

not
whither
we
know
not
what
they
be
yea
though
the
sunset
lingers
far
in
your
fairy
glades
though
yours
the
sweetest
singers
though
yours
the
kindest
maids
yet
here
be
the
true
shadows
here
in
the
doubtful
light
amid
the
dreamy
meadows
no
shadow
haunts
the
night
we
seek
a
city
splendid
with
light
beyond
the
sun

are

are
done
a
ballad
of
departure
fair
white
bird
what
song
art
thou
singing
in
wintry
weather
of
lands
sea
dear
white
bird
what
way
art
thou
winging
where
no
grass
grows
and
no
green
tree
i
looked
at
the
fields
and
grey
there
grew
no
tree
but
the
cypress
tree
that
bears
sad
fruits
with
the
flowers
of
may
and
whoso
looks
on
it
woe
is
he
and
whoso
eats
of
the
fruit
thereof
has
no
more
sorrow
and
no
more
love
and
who
sets
the
same
in
his
garden
stead
in
a
little
space
he
is
waste
and
dead
they
hear
the
sirens
for
the
second
time
the
weary
sails
a
moment
slept
the
oars
were
silent
for
a
space
as
past
hesperian
shores
we
swept
that
were
as
a
remembered
face
seen
after
lapse
of
hopeless
years
in
hades
when
the
shadows
meet
dim
through
the
mist
of
many
tears
and
strange
and
though
a
shadow
sweet
so
seemed
the
shore
that
slumbered
mirrored
in
the
blue
with
havens
where
we
touched
of
yore
and
ports
that
over
well
we
knew
then
broke
the
calm
before
a
breeze
that
sought
the
secret
of
the
west
and
listless
all
we
swept
the
seas
towards
the
islands
of
the
blest
beside
a
golden
sanded
bay
we
saw
the
sirens
very
fair
the
flowery
hill
whereon
they
lay
the
flowers
set
upon
their
hair
their
old
sweet
song
came
down
the
wind
remembered
music
waxing
strong
ah
now
no
need
of
cords
to
bind
no
need
had
we
of
orphic
song
it
once
had
seemed
a
little
thing
to
lay
our
lives
down
at
their
feet
that
dying
we
might
hear
them
sing
and
dying
see
their
faces
sweet
but
now
we
glanced
and
passing
by
no
care
had
we
to
tarry
long
faint
hope
and
rest
and
memory
were
more
than
any
song
isle
revisited
ah
circe
circe
in
the
wood
we
cried
ah
circe
circe
but
no
voice
replied
no
voice
from
bowers
and
ruinous
as
fallen
rocks
upon
the
mountain
side
there
was
no
sound
of
singing
in
the
air
faded
or
fled
the
maidens
that
were
fair
no
more
for
sorrow
or
joy
were
seen
of
us
no
light
of
laughing
eyes
or
floating
hair
the
perfume
and
the
music
and
the
flame
had
passed
away
the
memory
of
shame
alone
abode
and
stings
of
faint
desire
and
pulses
of
vague
quiet
went
and
came
ah
circe
in
thy
sad
changed
fairy
place
our
dead
youth
came
and
looked
on
us
a
space
with
drooping
wings
and
eyes
of
faded
fire
and
wasted
hair
about
a
weary
face
why
had
we
ever
sought
the
magic
isle
that
seemed
so
happy
in
the
days
erewhile
why
did
we
ever
leave
it
where
we
met
a
world
of
happy
wonders
in
one
smile
back
to
the
westward
and
the
waning
light
we
turned
we
fled
the
solitude
of
night
was
better
than
the
infinite
regret
in
fallen
places
of
our
dead
delight
the
limit
of
lands
between
the
circling
ocean
sea
and
the
poplars
of
persephone
there
lies
a
strip
of
barren
sand
flecked
with
the
last
spray
and
strown
with
waste
leaves
of
the
poplars
blown
from
gardens
of
the
shadow
land
with
altars
of
old
sacrifice
the
shore
is
set
in
mournful
wise
the
mists
upon
the
ocean
brood
between
the
water
and
the
air
the
clouds
are
born
that
float
and
fare
between
the
water
and
the
wood
upon
the
grey
sea
never
sail
of
mortals
passed
within
our
hail
where
the
last
weak
waves
faint
and
flow
we
heard
within
the
poplar
pale
the
murmur
of
a
doubtful
wail
of
voices
loved
so
long
ago
we
scarce
had
care
to
die
or
live
we
had
no
honey
cake
to
give
no
wine
of
sacrifice
to
shed
there
lies
no
new
path
over
sea
and
now
we
know
how
faint
they
be
the
feasts
and
voices
of
the
dead
ah
flowers
and
dance
ah
sun
and
snow
glad
life
sad
life
we
did
forego
to
dream
of
quietness
and
rest
ah
would
the
fleet
sweet
roses
here
poured
light
and
perfume
through
the
drear
pale
year
and
wan
land
of
the
west
sad
youth
that
let
the
spring
go
by
because
the
spring
is
swift
to
fly
sad
youth
that
feared
to
mourn
or
love
behold
how
sadder
far
is
this
to
know
that
rest
is
nowise
bliss
and
darkness
is
the
end
thereof
verses
martial
in
town
last
night
within
the
stifling
train
lit
by
the
foggy
lamp
sick
of
the
sad
last
news
i
read
verse
of
that
joyous
child
of
spain
who
dwelt
when
rome
was
waxing
cold
within
the
roman
din
and
smoke
and
like
my
heart
to
me
they
spoke
these
accents
of
his
heart
of
old
we
but
time
to
fleet
the
careless
hours
all
that
leisure
has
to
perfect
life
and
peaceful
rich
anxious
weary
know
us
quiet
summer
shade
by
field
and
county
talk
of
fain
would
neither
day
by
the
suns
wasting
in
the
feels
their
doth
lead
the
life
he
loveth
so
from
thy
city
prison
broke
martial
thy
wail
for
life
misspent
and
so
through
noise
and
smoke
my
heart
replies
to
the
lament
for
dear
as
tagus
with
his
gold
and
swifter
salo
were
to
thee
so
dear
to
me
the
woods
that
fold
the
streams
that
circle
fernielea
april
on
tweed
as
birds
are
fain
to
build
their
nest
the
first
soft
sunny
day
so
longing
wakens
in
my
breast
a
month
before
the
may
when
now
the
wind
is
from
the
west
and
winter
melts
away
the
snow
lies
yet
on
eildon
hill
but
soft
the
breezes
blow
if
melting
snows
the
waters
fill
we
nothing
heed
the
snow
but
we
must
up
and
take
our
will
a
fishing
will
we
go
below
the
branches
brown
and
bare
beneath
the
primrose
lea
the
trout
lies
waiting
for
his
fare
a
hungry
trout
is
he
hooked
and
springs
and
splashes
there
like
salmon
from
the
sea
oh
april
a
pleasant
tide
however
times
may
fall
and
sweet
to
welcome
spring
the
bride
you
hear
the
mavis
call
but
all
adown
the
the
most
fair
of
all
tired
of
towns
we
spoke
to
her
of
the
new
jerusalem
she
said
she
would
rather
go
to
a
country
place
in
from
the
black
weary
of
towns
it
seems
a
pity
we
stop
down
the
country
and
clem
and
you
say
that
bound
for
another
city
for
the
streets
the
new
jerusalem
and
the
streets
are
never
like
sheffield
here
nor
the
smoke
cling
like
a
smut
to
but
the
water
life
flows
cool
and
clear

sires
who
read
fortunes
in

who
voyaged
with
your

fires
from
waste
to
waste
across
the
land
why
did
you
leave
for
garth
and
town
your
life
by
heath
and

why
lay
your
gipsy
freedom
down
and
doom
your
child
to
pen

you
wearied
of
the
meal
that
crowned
or
failed
to

the

too
honest
or
too
tame
to
steal
you
broke
into
the
beaten
way
plied

or

like
other
men
and
learned
to
love
the
oh
recreant
sires
who
doomed
me
then
to

where
it
hath
fallen
the

must
lie
over
late
for
to

yet
the

bird
who
hears
the
cry
of
his
wild

fleeting
home
may
feel
no
sharper
pang
than
mine
who
seem
to
hear
i
think
spate
in
the
stream
and
wind
in
pine
call
me
to
quit
dull
pen
and

for
then
the
spirit
wandering
that
slept
within
the
blood
awakes
for
then
the
summer
and
the
spring
i
fain
would
meet
by
streams
and
lakes
but
ah
my
birthright
long
is
sold
but
custom
chains
me
link
on
link
and
i
must
get
me
as
of
old
back
to
my
tools
to
pen
and
ink
a
dream
why
will
you
haunt
my
sleep
you
know
it
may
not
be
the
grave
is
wide
and
deep
that
sunders
you
and
me
in
bitter
dreams
we
reap
the
sorrow
we
have
sown
and
i
would
i
were
asleep
forgotten
and
alone
we
knew
and
did
not
know
we
saw
and
did
not
see
the
nets
that
long

fate
wove
for
you
and
me
the
cruel
nets
that
keep
the
birds
that
sob
and

were

forgotten

the

rose
on

that
long

we
sung
again
you
come
at
call
again

with
trellised

with

shakes
the

there
is
no

this

within

swing
the
old
years
answer
them
and
thrill
a
wintry
heart
against
its
will
with
memories
of
the
that
spring
we
sought
the
gardens
through
for
flowers
which
in
gardens
grew
for
we
beside
our
knee
in
fairy
tales
had
heard
of
that
strange
rose
which
blossoms
free
on
boughs
of
an
enchanted
tree
and
sings
like
any
bird
and
of
the
weed
beside
the
way
that
leadeth
steps
astray
in
vain
we
sought
the
singing
rose
whereof
old
legends
tell
alas
we
found
it
not
mid
those
within
the
grey
old
college
close
that
budded
flowered
and
fell
we
found
that
herb
called
and
meet
no
more
no
more
in
spring
yes
unawares
the
unhappy
grass
that
leadeth
steps
astray
we
trod
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
never
more
we
twain
alas
shall
walk
the
way
and
each
must
deem
though
neither
knows

truly
you
lost

brought
flowers
and

to
you
but
i
would
none
thereof
whose
heart
kept
all
through
summer
time
a
flower
of
frost
and
winter
rime
yours
was
true
it
not
even
love
but
i
had
clean
forgot
till
seasons
of
the
falling
leaf
all
loves
but
one
that
turned
to
grief
at
length
at
touch
of
autumn
tide
when
roses
fell
and
summer
died
all
in
a
dawning
deep
with
dew
love
flew
to
me
love
fled
from
you
the
roses
drooped
their
weary
heads
i
spoke
among
the
garden
beds
you
would
not
hear
you
could
not
know
summer
and
love
seemed
long
ago
as
far
as
faint
as
dim
a
dream
as
to
the
dead
this
world
may
seem
ah
sweet
in

perchance
you
may
remember
this
how
wisdom
was
not
justified
in
summer
time
or
autumn
tide
though
for
this
once
below
the
sun
wisdom
and
love
were
made
at
one
but
love
was
enough
and
wisdom
light
of
wing
as
love
kiss
me
and
say
there
is
no
word
to
say
but
this
nor
any
lips
left
for
my
lips
to

nor
any
tears
to
shed
when
these
tears
dry
kiss
me
and
say
farewell
be
glad
forget
there
is
no
need
to
say
i
know
for
youth
is
youth
and
time
will
have
it
so
and
though
your
lips
are
pale
and
your
eyes
wet
farewell
you
must
forget
you
shall
bring
home
your
sheaves
many
and
heavy
and
with
blossoms
twined
of
memories
that
go
not
out
of
mind
let
this
one
sheaf
be
twined
with
poppy
leaves
when
you
bring
home
your
sheaves
in
garnered
loves
of
thine
the
ripe
good
fruit
of
many
hearts
and
years
somewhere
let
this
lie
grey
and
salt
with
tears
it
grew
too
near
the
sea
wind
and
the
brine
of
life
this
love
of
mine
this
sheaf
was
spoiled
in
spring
and
was
green
and
early
sere
and
never
gathered
gold
in
the
late
year
from
autumn
suns
and
moons
of
harvesting
but
failed
in
frosts
of
spring
yet
was
it
thine
my
sweet
this
love
though
weak
as
young
corn
withered
whereof
no
man
may
gather
and
make
bread
thine
though
it
never
knew

thou

sylvie
et
aurélie
in
memory
of
gérard
de
nerval
two
loves
there
were
and
one
was
born
between
the
sunset
and
the
rain
her
singing
voice
went
through
the
corn
her
dance
was
woven
the
thorn
on
grass
the
fallen
blossoms
stain
and
suns
may
set
and
moons
may
wane
but
this
love
comes
no
more
again
there
were
two
loves
and
one
made
white
thy
singing
lips
and
golden
hair
born
of
the
mire
and
light
the
shame
and
splendour
of
the
night
she
trapped
and
fled
thee
unaware
not
through
the
lamplight
and
the
rain
shalt
thou
behold
this
love
again
go
forth
and
seek
by
wood
and
hill
thine
ancient
love
of
dawn
and
dew
there
comes
no
voice
from
mere
or
rill
her
dance
is
over
fallen
still
the
ballad
burdens
that
she
knew
and
thou
must
wait
for
her
in
vain
till
years
bring
back
thy
youth
again
that
other
love
afield
afar
fled
the
light
love
with
lighter
feet
nay
though
thou
seek
where
gravesteads
are
and
flit
in
dreams
from
star
to
star
that
dead
love
shalt
thou
never
meet
till
through
bleak
dawn
and
blowing
rain
thy
soul
shall
find
her
soul
again
a
lost
path
plotinus
the
greek
philosopher
had
a
certain
proper
mode
of
ecstasy
whereby
as
porphyry
saith
his
soul
becoming
free
from
the
deathly
flesh
was
made
one
with
the
spirit
that
is
in
the
world
alas
the
path
is
lost
we
can
not
leave
our
bright
our
clouded
life
and
pass
away
as
through
strewn
clouds
that
stain
the
quiet
eve
to
heights
remoter
of
the
purer
day
the
soul
may
not
returning
whence
she
came
bathe
herself
deep
in
being
and
forget
the
joys
that
fever
and
the
cares
that
fret
made
once
more
one
with
the
eternal
flame
that
breathes
in
all
things
ever
more
the
same
she
would
be
young
again
thus
drinking
deep
of
her
old
life
and
this
has
been
men
say
but
this
we
know
not
who
have
only
sleep
to
soothe
us
sleep
more
terrible
than
day
where
dead
delights
and
fair
lost
faces
stray
to
make
us
weary
at
our
wakening
and
of
that
long
lost
path
to
the
divine
we
dream
as
some
greek
shepherd
erst
might
sing
half
credulous
of
easy
proserpine
and
of
the
lands
that
lie
the
the
shade
of
helen
some
say
that
helen
went
never
to
troy
but
abode
in
egypt
for
the
gods
having
made
in
her
semblance
a
woman
out
of
clouds
and
shadows
sent
the
same
to
be
wife
to
paris
for
this
shadow
then
the
greeks
and
trojans
slew
each
other
why
from
the
quiet
hollows
of
the
hills
and
extreme
meeting
place
of
light
and
shade
wherein
soft
rains
fell
slowly
and
became
clouds
among
sister
clouds
where
fair
spent
beams
and
dying
glories
of
the
sun
would
dwell
why
have
they
whom
i
know
not
nor

me

me

hither

to
harsh
and
clamorous

one
speaks
unto
me
words
that
would
be
sweet
made
harsh
made
keen
with
love
that
knows
me
not
and
some
strange
force
within
me
or
around
makes
answer
kiss
for
kiss
and
sigh
for
sigh
and
somewhere
there
is
fever
in
the

that
troubles
me
for
no
such
trouble
came
to
vex
the
cool
far

the

round

they

that

little
to

if
they
may
keep
me
here

me
flit
a
pale

silent

among
the

bereft
and
helpless

at

another

one

unswollen

of
unremembered

obedient
to
the

dark

around
me

again
the

took
to
my
bridal
bed

is
not

for
love
and

i
spoke
to
him
and
he
nothing
said
i
gave
him
bread
of
the
wheat
so
fine
he
did
not
eat
of
the
bridal
bread
he
did
not
drink
of
the
bridal
wine
i
made
him
a
bed
was
soft
and
deep
i
made
him
a
bed
to
sleep
with
me
on
me
once
before
you
sleep
and
look
on
the
flower
of
my
fair
body
of
april
and
fresh
dew
of
april
and
buds
of
may
two
white
blossoms
that
bud
for
you
buds
that
blossom
before
the
the
doe
french
it
was
a
mother
and
a
maid
that
walked
the
woods
among
and
still
the
maid
went
slow
and
sad
and
still
the
mother
sung
ails
you
daughter
margaret
why
go
you
pale
and
wan
is
it
for
a
cast
of
bitter
love
or
for
a
false
leman
is
not
for
a
false
lover
that
i
go
sad
to
see
but
it
is
for
a
weary
life
beneath
the
greenwood
tree
ever
in
the
good
daylight
a
maiden
may
i
go
but
always
on
the
ninth
midnight
i
change
to
a
doe
hunt
me
through
the
green
forest
with
hounds
and
hunting
men
and
ever
it
is
my
fair
brother
that
is
so
fierce
and
son
where
are
your
hounds
so
good
they
are
hunting
a
white
doe
within
the
glad
greenwood
three
times
have
they
hunted
her
and
thrice
won
away
the
fourth
time
that
they
follow
her
that
white
doe
they
shall
then
out
and
spoke
the
forester
as
he
came
from
the
wood
never
saw
i
gold
hair
among
the
wild
blood
i
have
hunted
the
wild
deer
in
east
lands
and
in
west
and
never
saw
i
white
doe
yet
that
had
a
then
up
and
spake
her
fair
brother
between
the
wine
and
bread
i
had
but
one
sister
and
i
have
been
her
dead
ye
must
bury
my
sweet
sister
with
a
stone
at
her
foot
and
her
head
and
ye
must
cover
her
fair
body
with
the
white
roses
and
red
i
must
out
to
the
greenwood
the
roof
shall
never
shelter
me
and
i
shall
lie
for
seven
long
years
on
the
grass
below
the
hawthorn
heliodore
meleager
pour
wine
and
cry
again
again
again
and
mingle
the
sweet
word
ye
call
in
vain
with
that
ye
pour
and
bring
to
me
her
wreath
of
yesterday
dank
with
myrrh
ah
my
friends
but
they
remember
her
lo
the
kind
roses
loved
of
lovers
weep
as
who
repine
for
if
on
any
breast
they
see
her
sleep
it
is
not
mine
the
prophet
antiphilus
i
knew
it
in
your
childish
grace
the
dawning
of
desire
lives
i
said
see
that
face
set
all
the
world
on
fire
they
mocked
but
time
has
brought
to
pass
the
saying
prophet
and
martyr
now
alas
i
burn
for
truth
you
lais
pompeius
lais
that
bloomed
for
all
the
delight
crowned
with
all
love
lilies
the
fair

dear
sleeps
the
predestined
sleep
nor
knows
the
flight
of

the

and
love
and
hate
one
night
darkens
that
never
lamp
of

may
cheer

for
death
not
for
love
hast
thou
loosened
thy
zone
flutes
filled
thy
bower
but
now
morning
brings
moan
maids
round
thy
bridal
bed
hushed
are
in
gloom
torches
to
love
that
led
light
to
the
tomb
the
tomb
leonidas
of
tarentum
theris
the
old
the
waves
that
harvested
more
keen
than
birds
that
labour
in
the
sea
with
spear
and
net
by
shore
and
rocky
bed
not
with
the
galley
laboured
he
him
not
the
star
of
storms
nor
sudden
sweep
of
wind
with
all
his
years
hath
smitten
and
bent
but
in
his
hut
of
reeds
he
fell
asleep
as
fades
a
lamp
when
all
the
oil
is
spent
this
tomb
nor
wife
nor
children
raised
but
we
his
fishers
of
the
sea
of
his
death
meleager
ah
love
my
master
hear
me
swear
by
all
the
locks
of
hair
by
demo
and
that
fragrant
spell
wherewith
her
body
doth
enchant
such
dreams
as
drowsy
lovers
haunt
by
mirth
delectable
and
by
the
lamp
that
sheds
his
light
on
love
and
lovers
all
the
night
by
those
ah
love
i
swear
that
thou
hast
left
me
but
one
breath
and
now
upon
my
lips
it
fluttereth
yet
yield
my
latest
breath
even
this
oh
love

thee

thou
art

each
loveliest
happy

he
who
sees
thy
face
happy
who
hears
thy
words
of

and
he
that
shall
kiss
thee

a

who
shall
win
that
heart
of
thine
to
a

it
is
not

to
hoard
a
mortal
maidenhood
in

thou
wilt
never

for
the
living

ashes
