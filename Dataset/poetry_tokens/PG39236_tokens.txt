description
of
a
horse
look
when
a
painter
would
surpass
the
life
in
limning
out
a
steed
his
art
with
nature
workmanship
at
strife
as
if
the
dead
the
living
should
exceed
so
did
this
horse
excel
a
common
one
in
shape
in
courage
color
pace
and
bone
fetlocks
shag
and
long
broad
breast
full
eye
small
head
and
nostril
wide
high
crest
short
ears
straight
legs
and
passing
strong
thin
mane
thick
tail
broad
buttock
tender
hide
look
what
a
horse
should
have
he
did
not
lack
save
a
proud
rider
on
so
proud
a
back
and
a
day
ride
a
life
analogy
tangled
forest
and
grass
plains
wide
by
many
a
devious
path
and
through
the
short
brightness
of
an
indian
day
in
middle
winter
was
my
lot
to
ride
skirting
the
mountain
side
while
far
away
upon
the
steely
blue
horizon
half
concealèd
half
in
view
himalay
peaks
upreared
their
pride
in
utter
purity
and
vast
repose
i
ere
the
first
faint
flush
of
morning
glowed
within
her
eastern
chamber
took
the
road
and
slowly
riding
between
day
and
night
i
marked
how
through
the
wan
imperfect
light
and
gray
loomed
the
eternal
snows
so
near
they
seemed
each
crack
and
crevice
small
like
work
showed
while
in
the
light
of
ruddy
morn
gray
changed
through
pink
to
white
but
soon
the
sun
flooded
all
the
heavens
and
then
a
thin
and
misty
pall
of
exhalations
rose
and
pale
of
hue
and
fainter
ever
those
far
summits
grew
until
the
day
waned
low
and
shadows
tall
sloped
eastward
then
once
more
in
radiance
clear
of
setting
sunlight
beautiful
as
brief
each
peak
and
crag
stood
out
in
bold
relief
till
slowly
pink
faded
to
ghostly
gray
so
through
life
morning
noontide
evening
may
ideal
hopes
dawn
fade
and
reappear
on
horseback
hurrah
for
a
ride
in
the
morning
gray
on
the
back
of
a
bounding
steed
what
pleasure
to
list
how
the
wild
winds
play
hark
hark
to
their
music
away
away
gallop
away
with
speed
the
leaf
and
the
cloud
in
pride
there
is
health
in
a
morning
joyous
ride
and
hurrah
for
a
ride
in
the
sultry
noon
when
the
summer
has
mounted
high
the
shady
wood
in
the
glowing
june
when
the
rivulet
chanteth
its
lullaby
tune
to
the
breeze
as
it
wanders
by
quietly
down
by
the
brooklet
side
sweet
is
the
summer
joyous
ride
and
do
you
not
love
at
evening
hour
by
the
light
of
the
sinking
sun
to
wend
your
way
the
widening
moor
where
the
silvery
mists
their
mystery
pour
while
the
stars
come
one
by
one
over
the
heath
by
the
mountain
side
pensive
and
sweet
is
the
evening
ride
i
tell
thee
o
stranger
that
unto
me
the
plunge
of
a
fiery
steed
is
a
noble
thought
to
the
brave
and
free
it
is
music
and
breath
and
majesty
is
the
life
of
a
noble
deed
and
the
heart
and
the
mind
are
in
spirit
allied
in
the
charm
of
a
morning
glorious
ride
then
hurrah
for
the
ring
of
the
bridle
rein
away
brave
horse
away
the
preacher
or
poet
may
chant
their
strain
the
bookman
his
wine
of
the
past
may
drain
we
bide
not
with
them
and
yet
it
is
true
we
may
look
with
pride
on
the
mental
spoils
of
a
morning
ride
paxton
the
horseback
ride
when
troubled
in
spirit
when
weary
of
life
when
i
faint
its
burdens
and
shrink
from
its
strife
when
its
fruits
turned
to
ashes
are
mocking
my
taste
and
its
fairest
scene
seems
but
a
desolate
waste
then
come
ye
not
near
me
my
sad
heart
to
cheer
with
friendship
soft
accents
or
sympathy
tear
no
pity
i
ask
and
no
counsel
i
need
but
bring
me
oh
bring
me
my
gallant
young
steed
with
his
high
archèd
neck
and
his
nostril
spread
wide
his
eye
full
of
fire
and
his
step
full
of
pride
as
i
spring
to
his
back
as
i
seize
the
strong
rein
the
strength
to
my
spirit
returneth
again
the
bonds
are
all
broken
that
fettered
my
mind
and
my
cares
borne
away
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
my
pride
lifts
its
head
for
a
season
bowed
down
and
the
queen
in
my
nature
now
puts
on
her
crown
now
we
off
like
the
winds
to
the
plains
whence
they
came
and
the
rapture
of
motion
is
thrilling
my
frame
on
on
speeds
my
courser
scarce
printing
the
sod
scarce
crushing
a
daisy
to
mark
where
he
trod
on
on
like
a
deer
when
the
hound
early
bay
awakes
the
wild
echoes
away
and
away
still
faster
still
farther
he
leaps
at
my
cheer
till
the
rush
of
the
startled
air
whirs
in
my
ear
now
a
clear
rivulet
lieth
his
track
see
his
glancing
hoofs
tossing
the
white
pebbles
back
now
a
glen
dark
as
midnight
what
matter
we
down
though
shadows
are
round
us
and
rocks
us
frown
the
thick
branches
shake
as
we
hurrying
through
and
deck
us
with
spangles
of
silvery
dew
what
a
wild
thought
of
triumph
that
this
girlish
hand
such
a
steed
in
the
might
of
his
strength
may
command
what
a
glorious
creature
ah
glance
at
him
now
as
i
check
him
a
while
on
this
green
hillock
brow
how
he
tosses
his
mane
with
a
shrill
joyous
neigh
and
paws
the
firm
earth
in
his
proud
stately
play
hurrah
off
again
dashing
on
as
in
ire
till
the
long
flinty
pathway
is
flashing
with
fire
ho
a
ditch
shall
we
pause
no
the
bold
leap
we
dare
like
a
arrow
we
rush
through
the
air
oh
not
all
the
pleasures
that
poets
may
praise
not
the
waltz
in
the
blaze
nor
the
chivalrous
joust
nor
the
daring
race
nor
the
swift
regatta
nor
merry
chase
nor
the
sail
high
heaving
waters
nor
the
rural
dance
on
the
moonlight
shore
can
the
wild
and
thrilling
joy
exceed
of
a
fearless
leap
on
a
fiery
steed
jane
an
evening
ride
from
glashütte
to
mügeln
in
saxony
we
ride
and
ride
high
on
the
hills
the
stretch
into
the
sky
the
birches
which
the
deep
calm
stills
quiver
again
as
we
speed
by
beside
the
road
a
shallow
stream
goes
leaping
its
rocky
bed
here
lie
the
with
a
gleam
of
daisies
white
and
poppies
red
a
faint
star
trembles
in
the
west
a
sparkles
fluttering
bright
against
the
mountain
sombre
breast
and
yonder
shines
a
village
light
oh
could
i
creep
into
thine
arms
beloved
and
upon
thy
face
read
the
arrest
of
dire
alarms
that
press
me
close
from
thy
embrace
view
the
sweet
earth
as
on
we
ride
alas
how
vain
our
longings
are
already
night
is
spreading
wide
her
sable
wing
and
thou
art
far
the
queen
ride
an
invitation
is
that
fair
time
of
year
lady
mine
when
stately
guinevere
in
her
robe
and
hood
went
through
the
wood
lady
mine
and
as
the
queen
did
ride
lady
mine
sir
launcelot
at
her
side
laughed
and
chatted
bending
over
half
her
friend
and
all
her
lover
lady
mine
and
as
they
rode
along
lady
mine
the
throstle
gave
them
song
and
the
buds
peeped
through
the
grass
to
see
youth
and
beauty
pass
lady
mine
and
on
through
deathless
time
lady
mine
these
lovers
in
their
prime
two
fairy
ghosts
together
ride
with
robe
and
feather
lady
mine
and
so
we
two
will
ride
lady
mine
at
your
pleasure
side
by
side
laugh
and
chat
i
bending
over
half
your
friend
and
all
your
lover
lady
mine
but
if
you
like
not
this
lady
mine
and
take
my
love
amiss
then
i
ride
unto
the
end
half
your
lover
all
your
friend
lady
mine
so
come
which
way
you
will
lady
mine
vale
upland
plain
and
hill
wait
your
coming
for
one
day
loose
the
bridle
and
away
lady
mine
the
last
ride
together
i
said
then
dearest
since
is
so
since
now
at
length
my
fate
i
know
since
nothing
all
my
love
avails
since
all
my
life
seemed
meant
for
fails
since
this
was
written
and
needs
must
be
my
whole
heart
rises
up
to
bless
your
name
in
pride
and
thankfulness
take
back
the
hope
you
gave
i
claim
only
a
memory
of
the
same
and
this
beside
if
you
will
not
blame
your
leave
for
one
more
last
ride
with
me
my
mistress
bent
that
brow
of
hers
those
deep
dark
eyes
where
pride
demurs
when
pity
would
be
softening
through
fixed
me
a
or
two
with
life
or
death
in
the
balance
right
the
blood
replenished
me
again
my
last
thought
was
at
least
not
vain
i
and
my
mistress
side
by
side
shall
be
together
breathe
and
ride
so
one
day
more
am
i
deified
who
knows
but
the
world
may
end
hush
if
you
saw
some
western
cloud
all
by
many
benedictions
and
moon
and
at
once
and
so
you
looking
and
loving
best
conscious
grew
your
passion
drew
cloud
sunset
moonrise
too
down
on
you
near
and
yet
more
near
till
flesh
must
fade
for
heaven
was
here
thus
leant
she
and
lingered
joy
and
fear
thus
lay
she
a
moment
on
my
breast
then
we
began
to
ride
my
soul
smoothed
itself
out
a
scroll
freshening
and
fluttering
in
the
wind
past
hopes
already
lay
behind
what
need
to
strive
with
a
life
awry
had
i
said
that
had
i
done
this
so
might
i
gain
so
might
i
miss
might
she
have
loved
me
just
as
well
she
might
have
hated
who
can
tell
where
had
i
been
now
if
the
worst
befell
and
here
we
are
riding
she
and
i
fail
i
alone
in
words
and
deeds
why
all
men
strive
and
who
succeeds
we
rode
it
seemed
my
spirit
flew
saw
other
regions
cities
new
as
the
world
rushed
by
on
either
side
i
thought
all
labor
yet
no
less
bear
up
beneath
their
unsuccess
look
at
the
end
of
work
contrast
the
petty
done
the
undone
vast
this
present
of
theirs
with
the
hopeful
past
i
hoped
she
would
love
me
here
we
ride
what
hand
and
brain
went
ever
paired
what
heart
alike
conceived
and
dared
what
act
proved
all
its
thought
had
been
what
will
but
felt
the
fleshly
screen
we
ride
and
i
see
her
bosom
heave
there
many
a
crown
for
who
can
reach
ten
lines
a
statesman
life
in
each
the
flag
stuck
on
a
heap
of
bones
a
soldier
doing
what
atones
they
scratch
his
name
on
the
my
riding
is
better
by
their
leave
what
does
it
all
mean
poet
well
your
brain
beat
into
rhythm
you
tell
what
we
felt
only
you
expressed
you
hold
things
beautiful
the
best
and
pace
them
in
rhyme
so
side
by
side
is
something
nay
is
much
but
then
have
you
yourself
what
best
for
men
are
you
poor
sick
old
ere
your
time
nearer
one
whit
your
own
sublime
than
we
who
never
have
turned
a
rhyme
sing
riding
a
joy
for
me
i
ride
and
you
great
sculptor
so
you
gave
a
score
of
years
to
art
her
slave
and
that
your
venus
whence
we
turn
to
yonder
girl
that
fords
the
burn
you
acquiesce
and
shall
i
repine
what
man
of
music
you
grown
gray
with
notes
and
nothing
else
to
say
is
this
your
sole
praise
from
a
friend
greatly
his
opera
strains
intend
but
in
music
we
know
how
fashions
end
i
gave
my
youth
but
we
ride
in
fine
who
knows
what
fit
for
us
had
fate
proposed
bliss
here
should
sublimate
my
being
had
i
signed
the
bond
still
one
must
lead
some
life
beyond
have
a
bliss
to
die
with
this
foot
once
planted
on
the
goal
this
round
my
soul
could
i
descry
such
try
and
test
i
sink
back
shuddering
from
the
quest
earth
being
so
good
would
heaven
seem
best
now
heaven
and
she
are
beyond
this
ride
and
yet
she
has
not
spoke
so
long
what
if
heaven
be
that
fair
and
strong
at
life
best
with
our
eyes
upturned
whither
life
flower
if
first
discerned
we
fixed
so
ever
should
so
abide
what
if
we
still
ride
on
we
two
with
life
forever
old
yet
new
changed
not
in
kind
but
in
degree
the
instant
made
eternity
and
heaven
just
prove
that
i
and
she
ride
ride
together
forever
ride
riding
together
for
many
many
days
together
the
wind
blew
steady
from
the
east
for
many
days
hot
grew
the
weather
about
the
time
of
our
lady
feast
for
many
days
we
rode
together
yet
met
we
neither
friend
nor
foe
hotter
and
clearer
grew
the
weather
steadily
did
the
blow
we
saw
the
trees
in
the
hot
bright
weather
with
shadows
very
black
as
freely
we
rode
on
together
with
helms
unlaced
and
bridles
slack
and
often
as
we
rode
together
we
looking
down
the
stream
saw
flowers
in
the
sunny
weather
and
saw
the
bream
and
in
the
night
lay
down
together
and
hung
above
our
heads
the
rood
or
watched
in
the
dewy
weather
the
while
the
moon
did
watch
the
wood
our
spears
stood
bright
and
thick
together
straight
out
the
banners
streamed
behind
as
we
galloped
on
in
the
sunny
weather
with
faces
turned
towards
the
wind
down
sank
our
threescore
spears
together
as
thick
we
saw
the
pagans
ride
his
eager
face
in
the
clear
fresh
weather
shone
out
that
last
time
by
my
side
up
the
sweep
of
the
bridge
we
dashed
together
it
rocked
to
the
crash
of
the
meeting
spears
down
rained
the
buds
of
the
dear
spring
weather
the
flowers
fell
like
tears
there
as
we
rolled
and
writhed
together
i
threw
my
arms
above
my
head
for
close
by
my
side
in
the
lovely
weather
i
saw
him
reel
and
fall
back
dead
i
and
the
slayer
met
together
he
waited
the
there
in
his
place
with
thoughts
of
death
in
the
lovely
weather
gapingly
mazed
at
my
maddened
face
madly
i
fought
as
we
fought
together
in
vain
the
little
christian
band
the
pagans
drowned
as
in
stormy
weather
the
river
drowns
land
they
bound
my
hands
together
they
bound
his
corpse
to
nod
by
my
side
then
on
we
rode
in
the
bright
march
weather
with
clash
of
cymbals
did
we
ride
we
ride
no
more
no
more
together
my
are
thick
and
strong
i
take
no
heed
of
any
weather
the
sweet
saints
grant
i
live
not
long
sir
launcelot
and
queen
guinevere
a
fragment
like
souls
that
balance
joy
and
pain
with
tears
and
smiles
from
heaven
again
the
maiden
spring
upon
the
plain
came
in
a
sunlit
fall
of
rain
in
crystal
vapor
everywhere
blue
isles
of
heaven
laughed
between
and
far
in
unseen
the
topmost
gathered
green
from
draughts
of
balmy
air
sometimes
the
linnet
piped
his
song
sometimes
the
throstle
whistled
strong
sometimes
the
sparhawk
wheeled
along
hushed
all
the
groves
from
fear
of
wrong
by
grassy
capes
with
fuller
sound
in
curves
the
yellowing
river
ran
and
drooping
began
to
spread
into
the
perfect
fan
above
the
teeming
ground
then
in
the
boyhood
of
the
year
sir
launcelot
and
queen
guinevere
rode
through
the
coverts
of
the
deer
with
blissful
treble
ringing
clear
she
seemed
a
part
of
joyous
spring
a
gown
of
silk
she
wore
buckled
with
golden
clasps
before
a
tuft
of
plumes
she
bore
closed
in
a
golden
ring
now
on
some
twisted
now
by
some
tinkling
rivulet
in
mosses
mixt
with
violet
her
mule
his
pastern
set
and
fleeter
now
she
skimmed
the
plains
than
she
whose
elfin
prancer
springs
by
night
to
eery
warblings
when
all
the
glimmering
moorland
rings
with
jingling
as
she
fled
fast
through
sun
and
shade
the
happy
winds
upon
her
played
blowing
the
ringlet
from
the
braid
she
looked
so
lovely
as
she
swayed
the
rein
with
dainty
a
man
had
given
all
other
bliss
and
all
his
worldly
worth
for
this
to
waste
his
whole
heart
in
one
kiss
upon
her
perfect
lips
the
king
of
denmark
ride
word
was
brought
to
the
danish
king
hurry
that
the
love
of
his
heart
lay
suffering
and
pined
for
the
comfort
his
voice
would
bring
o
ride
as
though
you
were
flying
better
he
loves
each
golden
curl
on
the
brow
of
that
scandinavian
girl
than
his
rich
crown
jewels
of
ruby
and
pearl
and
his
rose
of
the
isles
is
dying
thirty
nobles
saddled
with
speed
hurry
each
one
mounting
a
gallant
steed
which
he
kept
for
battle
and
days
of
need
o
ride
as
though
you
were
flying
spurs
were
struck
in
the
foaming
flank
chargers
staggered
and
sank
bridles
were
slackened
and
girths
were
burst
but
ride
as
they
would
the
king
rode
first
for
his
rose
of
the
isles
lay
dying
his
nobles
are
beaten
one
by
one
hurry
they
have
fainted
and
faltered
and
homeward
gone
his
little
fair
page
now
follows
alone
for
strength
and
for
courage
trying
the
king
looked
back
at
that
faithful
child
wan
was
the
face
that
answering
smiled
they
passed
the
drawbridge
with
clattering
din
then
he
dropped
and
only
the
king
rode
in
where
his
rose
of
the
isles
lay
dying
the
king
blew
a
blast
on
his
silence
no
answer
came
but
faint
and
forlorn
an
echo
returned
on
the
cold
gray
morn
like
the
breath
of
a
spirit
sighing
the
castle
portal
stood
grimly
wide
none
welcomed
the
king
from
that
weary
ride
for
dead
in
the
light
of
the
dawning
day
the
pale
sweet
form
of
the
welcomer
lay
who
had
yearned
for
his
voice
while
dying
the
panting
steed
with
a
drooping
crest
stood
weary
the
king
returned
from
her
chamber
of
rest
the
thick
sobs
choking
in
his
breast
and
that
dumb
companion
eying
the
tears
gushed
forth
which
he
strove
to
check
he
bowed
his
head
on
his
charger
neck
o
steed
that
every
nerve
didst
strain
dear
steed
our
ride
hath
been
in
vain
to
the
halls
where
my
love
lay
dying
caroline
rhyme
of
the
duchess
may
broad
the
forests
stood
i
read
on
the
hills
of
linteged
and
three
hundred
years
had
stood
mute
adown
each
hoary
wood
like
a
full
heart
having
prayed
and
the
little
birds
sang
east
and
the
little
birds
sang
west
and
but
little
thought
was
theirs
of
the
silent
antique
years
in
the
building
of
their
nest
down
the
sun
dropt
large
and
red
on
the
towers
of
linteged
lance
and
spear
upon
the
height
bristling
strange
in
fiery
light
while
the
castle
stood
in
shade
there
the
castle
stood
up
black
with
the
red
sun
at
its
back
like
a
sullen
smouldering
pyre
with
a
top
that
flickers
fire
when
the
wind
is
on
its
track
and
five
hundred
archers
tall
did
besiege
the
castle
wall
and
the
castle
seethed
in
blood
fourteen
days
and
nights
had
stood
and
was
near
its
fall
yet
thereunto
blind
to
doom
three
months
since
a
bride
did
come
one
who
proudly
trod
the
floors
and
softly
whispered
in
the
doors
may
good
angels
bless
our
home
oh
a
bride
of
queenly
eyes
with
a
front
of
constancies
oh
a
bride
of
cordial
mouth
where
the
untired
smile
of
youth
did
light
outward
its
own
sighs
was
a
duke
fair
and
her
uncle
ward
the
earl
who
betrothed
her
twelve
years
old
for
the
sake
of
dowry
gold
to
his
son
lord
leigh
the
churl
but
what
time
she
had
made
good
all
her
years
of
womanhood
unto
both
those
lords
of
leigh
spake
she
out
right
sovranly
my
will
runneth
as
my
blood
and
while
this
same
blood
makes
red
this
same
right
veins
she
said
is
my
will
as
lady
free
not
to
wed
a
lord
of
leigh
but
sir
guy
of
linteged
the
old
earl
he
smiled
smooth
then
he
sighed
for
willful
youth
good
my
niece
that
hand
withal
looketh
somewhat
soft
and
small
for
so
large
a
will
in
sooth
she
too
smiled
by
that
same
sign
but
her
smile
was
cold
and
fine
little
hand
clasps
muckle
gold
or
it
were
not
worth
the
hold
of
thy
son
good
uncle
mine
then
the
young
lord
jerked
his
breath
and
sware
thickly
in
his
teeth
he
would
wed
his
own
betrothed
an
she
loved
him
an
she
loathed
let
the
life
come
or
the
death
up
she
rose
with
scornful
eyes
as
her
father
child
might
rise
thy
hound
blood
my
lord
of
leigh
stains
thy
knightly
heel
quoth
she
and
he
moans
not
where
he
lies
but
a
woman
will
dies
hard
in
the
hall
or
on
the
sward
by
that
grave
my
lords
which
made
me
orphaned
girl
and
dowered
lady
i
deny
you
wife
and
ward
unto
each
she
bowed
her
head
and
swept
past
with
lofty
tread
ere
the
had
ceased
in
the
chapel
had
the
priest
blessed
her
bride
of
linteged
fast
and
fain
the
bridal
train
along
the
rode
amain
hard
the
steeds
of
lord
and
serf
struck
their
hoofs
out
on
the
turf
in
the
pauses
of
the
rain
fast
and
fain
the
kinsmen
train
along
the
storm
pursued
amain
steed
on
dashing
off
thickening
doubling
hoof
on
hoof
in
the
pauses
of
the
rain
and
the
bridegroom
led
the
flight
on
his
steed
of
might
and
the
bride
lay
on
his
arm
still
as
if
she
feared
no
harm
smiling
out
into
the
night
dost
thou
fear
he
said
at
last
nay
she
answered
him
in
haste
not
such
death
as
we
could
find
only
life
with
one
behind
ride
on
fast
as
fear
ride
fast
up
the
mountain
wheeled
the
steed
girth
to
ground
and
fetlocks
spread
headlong
bounds
and
rocking
flanks
down
he
staggered
down
the
banks
to
the
towers
of
linteged
high
and
low
the
serfs
looked
out
red
the
flambeaus
tossed
about
in
the
courtyard
rose
the
cry
live
the
duchess
and
sir
guy
but
she
never
heard
them
shout
on
the
steed
she
dropt
her
cheek
kissed
his
mane
and
kissed
his
neck
i
had
happier
died
by
thee
than
lived
on
a
lady
leigh
were
the
first
words
she
did
speak
but
a
three
months
joyaunce
lay
that
moment
and
when
five
hundred
archers
tall
stand
beside
the
castle
wall
to
recapture
duchess
may
and
the
castle
standeth
black
with
the
red
sun
at
its
back
and
a
fortnight
siege
is
done
and
except
the
duchess
none
can
misdoubt
the
coming
wrack
oh
the
little
birds
sang
east
and
the
little
birds
sang
west
on
the
tower
the
castle
lord
leant
in
silence
on
his
sword
with
an
anguish
in
his
breast
with
a
weight
did
he
lean
down
they
have
almost
sapped
the
wall
they
will
enter
therewithal
with
no
knocking
at
the
gate
then
the
sword
he
leant
upon
shivered
snapped
upon
the
stone
sword
he
thought
with
inward
laugh
ill
thou
servest
for
a
staff
when
thy
nobler
use
is
done

thy
nobler
use
is
done
tower
is
lost
and
shame
begun
if
we
met
them
in
the
breach

hilt
or
speech
to
speech
we
should
die
there
each
for
one
if
we
met
them
at
the
wall
we
should
singly
vainly
fall

if
die
here
alone
then
i
die
who
am

and
die
nobly
for
them
all
five
true
friends

for
my

in
the
moat
and
in
the
brake
thirteen
warriors
lie
at
rest
with
a
black
wound
in
the
breast
and
not

of
these

too
heavily

and
dim
till
his
true
men
in
the
place
wished
they
stood
there
face
to
face
with
the
foe
instead
of
him
one

failed
in

stood
around
to

ralph
and
clare
faithful
hearts
to

that
steed
up
from
his
stall

his
men
looked
to
and
fro
when
they
heard
him
speaking
the
noble
heart
they
thought
he
in
sooth
is
would
we
stood
here
with
the
foe
but
a
fire
flashed
from
his
eye
their
thought
and
their
reply

ye
so
much
time
to
waste

who
ride
here
must
ride
fast
as
we
wish
our
foes
to
fly

have
fetched
the
steed
with
care
in
the
harness
he
did
wear
past
the
court
and
through
the
doors
across
the
rushes
of
the
floors

they
goad
him
up
the

her
head
and

her
hair
coiled
on
the
floor
and

stood
up
in
bitter
case
with
a
pale
yet
steady
face
like
a
statue
thunderstruck
which
though
quivering
seems
to
look
right
against

she
took
and
his
neck
did
kiss
and
stroke
soft
he
neighed
to
answer
her
and
then
followed
up
the
stair
for
the
love
of
her
sweet
look
oh
and
steeply
steeply
wound
up
the
narrow
stair
around
oh
and
closely
closely
speeding
step
by
step
beside
her
treading
did
he
follow
meek
as
hound
on
the
east
tower
of
all
there
where
never
a
hoof
did
fall
out
they
swept
a
vision
steady
noble
steed
and
lovely
lady
calm
as
if
in
bower
or
stall
down
she
knelt
at
her
lord
knee
and
she
looked
up
silently
and
he
kissed
her
twice
and
thrice
for
that
look
within
her
eyes
which
he
could
not
bear
to
see
quoth

thee
from
this
strife

life
in
this
hour

noble
steed
but
no
more
of
my
noble
wife

meekly
have
i
done
all
thy
biddings
under
sun
but
by
all
my
womanhood
which
is
proved
so
true
and
good
i
will
never
do
this
one
now
by
womanhood
degree
and
by
wifehood

in
this
hour
if
thou

up
in
the
selle
and
he
laughed

among
the
leaves
as
we
used
on
other
eves
to
hear
chime
a

clang
closer
to

along
the
greenwood

i
ridden
fast
with
thee
fast
i
rode
with
vows
from
my
angry
kinsman
house
what
and
would
you
men
should
reck
that
i
dared
more
for
love
sake
as
a
bride
than
as
a
spouse
what
and
would
you
it
should
fall
as
a
proverb
before
all
that
a
bride
may
keep
your
side
while
through
you
ride
yet
eschew
the
ho
the
breach
yawns
into
ruin
and
roars
up
against
her
suing
with
the
inarticulate
din
and
the
dreadful
falling
in
shrieks
of
doing
and
undoing
twice
he
wrung
her
hands
in
twain
but
the
small
hands
closed
again
back
he
reined
the
steed
back
back
but
she
trailed
along
his
track
with
a
frantic
clasp
and
strain
evermore
the
foemen
pour
through
the
crash
of
window
and
door
and
the
shouts
of
leigh
and
leigh
and
the
shrieks
of
kill
and
flee
strike
up
clear
amid
the
roar
thrice
he
wrung
her
hands
in
twain
but
they
closed
and
clung
again
wild
she
clung
as
one
withstood
clasps
a
christ
upon
the
rood
in
a
spasm
of
deathly
pain
she
clung
wild
and
she
clung
mute
with
her
shuddering
lips
her
head
fallen
as
half
in
swound
hair
and
knee
swept
on
the
ground
she
clung
wild
to
stirrup
and
foot
back
he
reined
his
steed
on
the
slippery
back
the
iron
hoofs
did
grind
on
the
battlement
behind
whence
a
hundred
feet
went
down
and
his
heel
did
press
and
goad
on
the
quivering
flank
bestrode
friends
and
brothers
save
my
wife
pardon
sweet
in
change
for
life
but
i
ride
alone
to
god
straight
as
if
the
holy
name
had
upbreathed
her
like
a
flame
she
upsprang
she
rose
upright
in
his
selle
she
sate
in
sight
by
her
love
she
overcame
and
her
head
was
on
his
breast
where
she
smiled
as
one
at
rest
ring
she
cried
o
in
the
beechwood
old
chapelle
but
the
rings
best
they
have
caught
out
at
the
rein
which
sir
guy
threw
loose
in
vain
for
the
horse
in
stark
despair
with
his
front
hoofs
poised
in
air
on
the
last
verge
rears
amain
now
he
hangs
the
rocks
between
and
his
nostrils
curdle
in
now
he
shivers
head
and
hoof
and
the
flakes
of
foam
fall
off
and
his
face
grows
fierce
and
thin
and
a
look
of
human
woe
from
his
staring
eyes
did
go
and
a
sharp
cry
uttered
he
in
a
foretold
agony
of
the
headlong
death
below
and
ring
ring
thou
still
she
cried
i
the
old
chapelle
then
crashing
back
a
dead
weight
flung
out
to
wrack
horse
and
riders
overfell
barrett
irmingard
escape
i
am
the
lady
irmingard
born
of
a
noble
race
and
name
many
a
wandering
suabian
bard
whose
life
was
dreary
and
bleak
and
hard
has
found
through
me
the
way
to
fame
brief
and
bright
were
those
days
and
the
night
which
followed
was
full
of
a
lurid
light
love
that
of
every
woman
heart
will
have
the
whole
and
not
a
part
that
is
to
her
in
nature
plan
more
than
ambition
is
to
man
her
light
her
life
her
very
breath
with
no
alternative
but
death
found
me
a
maiden
soft
and
young
just
from
the
convent
cloistered
school
and
seated
on
my
lowly
stool
attentive
while
the
minstrels
sung
gallant
graceful
gentle
tall
fairest
noblest
best
of
all
was
walter
of
the
vogelweid
and
whatsoever
may
betide
still
i
think
of
him
with
pride
his
song
was
of
the
the
very
birds
sang
in
his
rhyme
the
sunshine
the
delicious
air
the
fragrance
of
the
flowers
were
there
and
i
grew
restless
as
i
heard
restless
and
buoyant
as
a
bird
down
soft
aerial
currents
sailing
blossomed
orchards
and
fields
in
bloom
and
through
the
momentary
gloom
of
shadows
the
landscape
trailing
yielding
and
borne
i
knew
not
where
but
feeling
resistance
unavailing
and
thus
unnoticed
and
apart
and
more
by
accident
than
choice
i
listened
to
that
single
voice
until
the
chambers
of
my
heart
were
filled
with
it
by
night
and
day
one
night
it
was
a
night
in
may
within
the
garden
unawares
under
the
blossoms
in
the
gloom
i
heard
it
utter
my
own
name
with
protestations
and
wild
prayers
and
it
rang
through
me
and
became
like
the
archangel
trump
of
doom
which
the
soul
hears
and
must
obey
and
mine
arose
as
from
a
tomb
my
former
life
now
seemed
to
me
such
as
hereafter
death
may
be
when
in
the
great
eternity
we
shall
awake
and
find
it
day
it
was
a
dream
and
would
not
stay
a
dream
that
in
a
single
night
faded
and
vanished
out
of
sight
my
father
anger
followed
fast
this
passion
as
a
freshening
blast
seeks
out
and
fans
the
fire
whose
rage
it
may
increase
but
not
assuage
and
he
exclaimed
no
wandering
bard
shall
win
thy
hand
o
irmingard
for
which
prince
henry
of
hoheneck
by
messenger
and
letter
sues
gently
but
firmly
i
replied
henry
of
hoheneck
i
discard
never
the
hand
of
irmingard
shall
lie
in
his
as
the
hand
of
a
bride
this
said
i
walter
for
thy
sake
this
said
i
for
i
could
not
choose
after
a
pause
my
father
spake
in
that
cold
and
deliberate
tone
which
turns
the
hearer
into
stone
and
seems
itself
the
act
to
be
that
follows
with
such
dread
certainty
this
or
the
cloister
and
the
veil
no
other
words
than
these
he
said
but
they
were
like
a
funeral
wail
my
life
was
ended
my
heart
was
dead
that
night
from
the
went
down
with
silent
slow
and
stealthy
pace
two
shadows
mounted
on
shadowy
steeds
taking
the
narrow
path
that
leads
into
the
forest
dense
and
brown
in
the
leafy
darkness
of
the
place
one
could
not
distinguish
form
nor
face
only
a
bulk
without
a
shape
a
darker
shadow
in
the
shade
one
scarce
could
say
it
moved
or
stayed
thus
it
was
we
made
our
escape
a
foaming
brook
with
many
a
bound
followed
us
like
a
playful
hound
then
leaped
before
us
and
in
the
hollow
paused
and
waited
for
us
to
follow
and
seemed
impatient
and
afraid
that
our
tardy
flight
should
be
betrayed
by
the
sound
our
horses
made
and
when
we
reached
the
plain
below
we
paused
a
moment
and
drew
rein
to
look
back
at
the
castle
again
and
we
saw
the
windows
all
aglow
with
lights
that
were
passing
to
and
fro
our
hearts
with
terror
ceased
to
beat
the
brook
crept
silent
to
our
feet
we
knew
what
most
we
feared
to
know
then
suddenly
horns
began
to
blow
and
we
heard
a
shout
and
a
heavy
tramp
and
our
horses
snorted
in
the
damp
of
the
meadows
green
and
wide
and
in
a
moment
side
by
side
so
close
they
must
have
seemed
but
one
the
shadows
across
the
moonlight
run
and
another
came
and
swept
behind
like
the
shadow
of
clouds
before
the
wind
how
i
remember
that
breathless
flight
across
the
moors
in
the
summer
night
how
under
our
feet
the
long
white
road
backward
like
a
river
flowed
sweeping
with
it
fences
and
hedges
whilst
farther
away
and
overhead
paler
than
i
with
fear
and
dread
the
moon
fled
with
us
as
we
fled
along
the
forest
jagged
edges
all
this
i
can
remember
well
but
of
what
afterwards
befell
i
nothing
further
can
recall
than
a
blind
desperate
headlong
fall
the
rest
is
a
blank
and
darkness
all
when
i
awoke
out
of
this
swoon
the
sun
was
shining
not
the
moon
making
a
cross
upon
the
wall
with
the
bars
of
my
windows
narrow
and
tall
and
i
prayed
to
it
as
i
had
been
wont
to
pray
from
early
childhood
day
by
day
each
morning
as
in
bed
i
lay
i
was
lying
again
in
my
own
room
and
i
thanked
god
in
my
fever
and
pain
that
those
shadows
on
the
midnight
plain
were
gone
and
could
not
come
again
i
struggled
no
longer
with
my
doom
wadsworth
william
and
helen
from
heavy
dreams
fair
helen
rose
and
eyed
the
dawning
red
alas
my
love
thou
tarriest
long
o
art
thou
false
or
dead
with
gallant
princely
power
he
sought
the
bold
crusade
but
not
a
word
from
judah
wars
told
helen
how
he
sped
with
paynim
and
with
saracen
at
length
a
truce
was
made
and
every
knight
returned
to
dry
the
tears
his
love
had
shed
our
gallant
host
was
homeward
bound
with
many
a
song
of
joy
green
waved
the
laurel
in
each
plume
the
badge
of
victory
and
old
and
young
and
sire
and
son
to
meet
them
crowd
the
way
with
shouts
and
mirth
and
melody
the
debt
of
love
to
pay
full
many
a
maid
her
met
and
sobbed
in
his
embrace
and
fluttering
joy
in
tears
and
smiles
arrayed
full
many
a
face
nor
joy
nor
smile
for
helen
sad
she
sought
the
host
in
vain
for
none
could
tell
her
william
fate
if
faithless
or
if
slain
the
martial
band
is
past
and
gone
she
rends
her
raven
hair
and
in
distraction
bitter
mood
she
weeps
with
wild
despair
o
rise
my
child
her
mother
said
nor
sorrow
thus
in
vain
a
perjured
lover
fleeting
heart
no

upbraids
each

silent
room
all
in

lonely

she
beat
her

she
wrung
her
hands
till
sun
and
day
were
and
through
the
glimmering
lattice
shone
the
twinkling
of
the
star
then
crash
the
heavy
drawbridge
fell
that
the
moat
was
hung
and
clatter
clatter
on
its
boards
the

the
clank
of
echoing
steel
was
heard
as
off

bounded
and
slowly
on

a
heavy
footstep
sounded
and

the

she
looks
in
thoughtful
silence
to
see
him
sit
in
pride
she
saw
him
now
make
ready
then
trembled
she
and
sighed
the
lady
kunigunde
woe

so

then
rode
he
round
the

the
knight
is
riding
down
to

rides
around
the
kynast
right
round
the
narrow
wall
the
lady
kunigunde
she
can
not
stir
for
terror
her
lily
hand
at
all
he
rides
around
the
kynast
clear
round
the
battlement
the
lady
kunigunde
as
if
a
breath
might
kill
him
she
held
her
breath
suspent
he
rode
around
the
kynast
and
straight
to
her
rode
he
said
the
lady
kunigunde
of
kynast
thanks
be
to
god
in
heaven
who
gave
thy
life
to
thee
thanks
be
to
god
that
into

grave
thou
didst
not
ride
said
the
lady
kunigunde
come
down
from
off
thy
horse
now
o
knight
unto
thy
bride
then
spake
the
noble
rider
and
greeted
as
he
sate
the
lady
kunigunde
o
trust
a
knight
for
horsemanship
well
have
i
taught
thee
that
now
wait
till

another
who

the
same
thing
do
o
lady
kunigunde
of
kynast
i
wife
and
child
already
can
be
no
spouse
for
you
he
gave
his
steed
the
spur
now
rode
back
the
way
he
came
the
lady
kunigunde
the
lady
saw
him
vanish
she
swooned
with
scorn
and
shame
and
she
remains
a
virgin
her
pride
had
such
a
fall
the
lady
kunigunde
changed
to
a
wooden
image
she
stands
in
sight
of
all
an
image
like
a
hedgehog
with
spines
for
hair
is
now
the
lady
kunigunde
of
kynast
the
stranger
has
to
kiss
it
who
climbs
the
kynast
brow
we
bring
it
him
to
kiss
it
and
if
it
shocks
his
pride
the
lady
kunigunde
of
kynast
he
must
pay
down
his
forfeit
who
will
not
kiss
the
bride
the
lady
kunigunde
tr
harras
the
bold
leaper
the
world
yet
waited
in
shadowy
light
the
dawn
of
the
rising
day
and
scarcely
yet
had
waked
the
night
from
the
slumber
in
which
it
lay
but
hark
along
the
forest
way
unwonted
echoes
rung
and
all
accoutred
for
the
fray
a
band
of
warriors
sprung
and
forth
they
rushed
along
the
plain
in
thunder
to
the
fight
and
foremost
of
that
martial
train
was
harras
the
gallant
knight
they
ride
upon
their
secret
way
forest
and
vale
and
down
to
reach
their
foe
while
yet
is
day
and
storm
his
castled
town
so
sally
they
forth
from
the
forest
gloom
but
as
they
leave
its
shade
they
rush
alas
to
meet
their
doom
and
their
progress
is
betrayed
for
suddenly
bursts
upon
their
rear
the
foe
with
twice
their
force
then
out
at
once
rush
shield
and
spear
and
the
charger
flies
on
his
course
and
the
wood
in
unwonted
echoes
rang
with
the
sounds
of
that
deadly
fray
and
the
sabre
clash
and
the
helmet
clang
is
mixed
with
the
courser
neigh
a
thousand
wounds
have
dyed
the
field
unheeded
in
the
strife
but
not
a
man
will
ask
to
yield
for
freedom
is
dearer
than
life
but
their
stronger
foes
must
win
the
day
and
the
knights
begin
to
fail
for
the
sword
hath
swept
their
best
array
and
superior
powers
prevail
unconquered
alone
to
a
rocky
height
bold
harras
fought
his
way
and
his
brave
steed
carried
him
through
the
fight
and
bore
him
safe
away
and
he
left
the
rein
to
that
trusty
steed
and
rode
from
the
fatal
fray
but
he
gave
to
his
erring
path
no
heed
and
he
missed
the
way
and
when
he
heard
the
foemen
near
he
sprang
from
the
forest
gloom
but
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
daylight
clear
he
saw
at
once
his
doom
he
had
reached
a
frightful
precipice
where
he
heard
the
deep
waves
roll
for
he
stood
on
zschopauthal
dread
abyss
and
horror
chilled
his
soul
for
on
yonder
bank
he
could
espy
the
remnant
of
his
band
and
his
heart
impatient
panted
high
as
they
waved
the
friendly
hand
and
he
longed
as
he
looked
that
dreadful
steep
for
wings
to
aid
his
flight
for
that
cliff
is
full
fifty
fathoms
deep
and
his
horse
drew
back
with
fright
and
he
saw
as
he
looked
behind
and
below
on
either
side
his
grave
behind
him
from
the
coming
foe
before
him
in
the
wave
and
he
chooses
death
from
the
foemen
hand
or
death
where
the
deep
waves
roll
then
he
boldly
rides
up
to
that
rocky
strand
and
commends
to
the
lord
his
soul
and
as
nearer
he
hears
the
foemen
ride
he
seeks
the
utmost
steep
and
he
plunges
his
spurs
in
his
courser
side
and
dares
the
dreadful
leap
and
swiftly
he
sank
through
the
yielding
air
and
into
the
flood
he
fell
his
steed
is
dashed
to
atoms
there
but
the
knight
lives
safe
and
well
and
mid
the
plaudits
of
his
band
he
stemmed
the
parting
wave
and
soon
in
safety
reached
the
land
for
heaven
will
never
forsake
the
brave
theodor
körner
tr
the
knight
leap
so
the
foeman
has
fired
the
gate
men
of
mine
and
the
water
is
spent
and
done
then
bring
me
a
cup
of
the
red
i
never
shall
drink
but
this
one
and
fetch
me
my
harness
and
saddle
my
horse
and
lead
him
me
round
to
the
door
he
must
take
such
a
leap
perforce
as
horse
never
took
before
i
have
lived
by
the
saddle
for
years
two
score
and
if
i
must
die
on
tree
the
old
which
has
borne
me
of
yore
is
the
properest
timber
for
me
i
have
lived
my
life
i
have
fought
my
fight
i
have
drunk
my
share
of
wine
from
trier
to
cöln
there
was
never
a
knight
led
a
merrier
life
than
mine
so
now
to
show
bishop
and
burgher
and
priest
how
the
altenahr
hawk
can
die
if
they
smoke
the
old
falcon
out
of
his
nest
he
must
take
to
his
wings
and
fly
he
harnessed
himself
by
the
clear
moonshine
and
he
mounted
his
horse
at
the
door
and
he
drained
such
a
cup
of
the
red
as
never
man
drained
before
he
spurred
the
old
horse
and
he
held
him
tight
and
he
leapt
him
out
over
the
wall
out
over
the
cliff
out
into
the
night
three
hundred
feet
of
fall
they
found
him
next
morning
below
in
the
glen
and
never
a
bone
in
him
whole
but
heaven
may
yet
have
more
mercy
than

on

night
and

now
through

suddenly
the

thirty

from

his

his

that
shore
beside
the
peaceful
sea
where
beat
their
réveille
out
of
the
mission
of
san
luis
rey
all
in
that
brisk
tumultuous
spring
weather
rode
friar
pedro
in
a
pious
way
with
six
dragoons
in
cuirasses
of
leather
each
armed
alike
for
either
prayer
or
fray
handcuffs
and
missals
they
had
slung
together
and
as
in
aid
the
gospel
truth
to
scatter
each
swung
a
lasso
a
riata
in
sooth
that
year
the
harvest
had
been
slack
the
crop
of
converts
scarce
worth
computation
some
souls
were
lost
whose
owners
had
turned
back
to
save
their
bodies
frequent
flagellation
and
some
preferred
the
songs
of
birds
alack
to
latin
matins
and
their
soul
salvation
and
thought
their
own
wild
whoopings
were
less
dreary
than
father
pedro
droning
to
bring
them
back
to
matins
and
to
prime
to
pious
works
and
secular
submission
to
prove
to
them
that
liberty
was
crime
this
was
in
fact
the
padre
present
mission
to
get
new
souls
perchance
at
the
same
time
and
bring
them
to
a
sense
of
their
condition
that
easy
phrase
which
in
the
past
and
present
means
making
that
condition
most
unpleasant
he
saw
the
glebe
land
guiltless
of
a
furrow
he
saw
the
wild
oats
wrestle
on
the
hill
he
saw
the
gopher
working
in
his
burrow
he
saw
the
squirrel
scampering
at
his
will
he
saw
all
this
and
felt
no
doubt
a
thorough
and
deep
conviction
of
god
goodness
still
he
failed
to
see
that
in
his
glory
he
yet
left
the
humblest
of
his
creatures
free
he
saw
the
flapping
crow
whose
frequent
note
voiced
the
monotony
of
land
and
sky
mocking
with
graceless
wing
and
rusty
coat
his
priestly
presence
as
he
trotted
by
he
would
have
cursed
the
bird
by
bell
and
rote
but
other
game
just
then
was
in
his
eye
a
savage
camp
whose
occupants
preferred
their
heathen
darkness
to
the
living
word
he
rang
his
bell
and
at
the
martial
sound
twelve
silver
spurs
their
jingling
rowels
clashed
six
horses
sprang
across
the
level
ground
as
six
dragoons
in
open
order
dashed
above
their
heads
the
lassos
circled
round
in
every
eye
a
pious
fervor
flashed
they
charged
the
camp
and
in
one
moment
more
they
lassoed
six
and
reconverted
four
the
friar
saw
the
conflict
from
a
knoll
and
sang
and
cheered
on
his
men
well
thrown

that
another
soul

surely

but
they
very
wild
nobis
all
right
my
child
when
at
that
moment
as
the
story
goes
a
certain
squaw
who
had
her
foes
eluded
ran
past
the
friar
just
before
his
nose
he
stared
a
moment
and
in
silence
brooded
then
in
his
breast
a
pious
frenzy
rose
and
every
other
prudent
thought
excluded
he
caught
a
lasso
and
dashed
in
a
canter
after
that
occidental
atalanta
high
his
head
he
swirled
the
dreadful
noose
but
as
the
practice
was
quite
unfamiliar
his
first
cast
tore
felipe
captive
loose
and
almost
choked
tiburcio
camilla
and
might
have
interfered
with
that
brave
ability
to
gorge
the
tough
but
all
things
come
by
practice
and
at
last
his
flying
caught
the
maiden
fast
then
rose
above
the
plain
a
mingled
yell
of
rage
and
triumph
a
demoniac
whoop
the
padre
heard
it
like
a
passing
knell
and
would
have
loosened
his
unchristian
loop
but
the
tough
held
the
captive
well
and
held
alas
too
well
the
for
with
one
bound
the
savage
fled
amain
dragging
horse
friar
down
the
lonely
plain
down
the
out
across
the
mead
by
heath
and
hollow
sped
the
flying
maid
dragging
behind
her
still
the
panting
steed
and
helpless
friar
who
in
vain
essayed
to
cut
the
lasso
or
to
check
his
speed
he
felt
himself
beyond
all
human
aid
and
trusted
to
the
saints
and
for
that
matter
to
some
weak
spot
in
felipe
alas
the
lasso
had
been
duly
blessed
and
like
baptism
held
the
flying
wretch
a
doctrine
that
the
priest
had
oft
expressed
which
like
the
lasso
might
be
made
to
stretch
but
would
not
break
so
neither
could
divest
themselves
of
it
but
like
some
awful
the
holy
friar
had
to
recognize
the
image
of
his
fate
in
heathen
guise
he
saw
the
glebe
land
guiltless
of
a
furrow
he
saw
the
wild
oats
wrestle
on
the
hill
he
saw
the
gopher
standing
in
his
burrow
he
saw
the
squirrel
scampering
at
his
will
he
saw
all
this
and
felt
no
doubt
how
thorough
the
contrast
was
to
his
condition
still
the
squaw
kept
onward
to
the
sea
till
night
and
the
cold
hid
them
both
from
sight
the
morning
came
above
the
serried
coast
lighting
the
with
its
beacon
fires
driving
before
it
all
the
host
of
chattering
birds
above
the
mission
spires
filling
the
land
with
light
and
joy
but
most
the
savage
woods
with
all
their
leafy
lyres
in
pearly
tints
and
opal
flame
and
fire
the
morning
came
but
not
the
holy
friar
weeks
passed
away
in
vain
the
fathers
sought
some
trace
or
token
that
might
tell
his
story
some
thought
him
dead
or
like
elijah
caught
up
to
the
heavens
in
a
blaze
of
glory
in
this
surmise
some
miracles
were
wrought
on
his
account
and
souls
in
purgatory
were
thought
to
profit
from
his
intercession
in
brief
his
absence
made
a
deep
impression
a
twelvemonth
passed
the
welcome
spring
once
more
made
green
the
hills
beside
the
mission
spread
her
bright
dais
by
the
western
shore
and
sat
enthroned
a
most
resplendent
vision
the
heathen
converts
thronged
the
chapel
door
at
morning
mass
when
says
the
old
tradition
a
frightful
whoop
throughout
the
church
resounded
and
to
their
feet
the
congregation
bounded
a
tramp
of
hoofs
upon
the
beaten
course
then
came
a
sight
that
made
the
bravest
quail
a
phantom
friar
on
a
spectre
horse
dragged
by
a
creature
decked
with
horns
and
tail
by
the
lone
mission
with
the
whirlwind
force
they
madly
swept
and
left
a
sulphurous
trail
and
that
was
all
enough
to
tell
the
story
and
leave
unblessed
those
souls
in
purgatory
and
ever
after
on
that
fatal
day
that
friar
pedro
rode
abroad
lassoing
a
ghostly
couple
came
and
went
away
with
savage
whoop
and
heathenish
hallooing
which
brought
discredit
on
san
luis
rey
and
proved
the
mission
ruin
and
undoing
for
ere
ten
years
had
passed
the
squaw
and
friar
performed
to
empty
walls
and
fallen
spire
the
mission
is
no
more
upon
its
walls
the
golden
lizards

or
breathless
pause
still
as
the
sunshine
brokenly
that
falls
through
crannied
roof
and
of
gauze
no
more
the

its
solemn
warning
calls

fine
flower
shall
she
pluck
for
my
boy
o
father
my
father
and
did
you
not
hear
the
whisper
so
loud
in
my
ear
be
still
my
heart
darling
my
child
be
at
ease
it
was
but
the
wild
blast
as
it
sung
thro
the
trees
o
wilt
thou
go
with
me
thou
loveliest
boy
my
daughter
shall
tend
thee
with
care
and
with
joy
she
shall
bear
thee
so
lightly
thro
wet
and
thro
wild
and
press
thee
and
kiss
thee
and
sing
to
my
child
o
father
my
father
and
saw
you
not
plain
the
pale
daughter
glide
past
thro
the
rain
o
yes
my
loved
treasure
i
knew
it
full
soon
it
was
the
gray
willow
that
danced
to
the
moon
o
come
and
go
with
me
no
longer
delay
or
else
silly
child
i
will
drag
thee
away
o
father
o
father
now
now
keep
your
hold
the
has
seized
me
his
grasp
is
so
cold
sore
trembled
the
father
he
spurred
thro
the
wild
clasping
close
to
his
bosom
his
shuddering
child
he
reaches
his
dwelling
in
doubt
and
in
dread
but
clasped
to
his
bosom
the
infant
was
mazeppa
ride
forth
the
horse
the
horse
was
brought
in
truth
he
was
a
noble
steed
a
tartar
of
the
ukraine
breed
who
looked
as
though
the
speed
of
thought
were
in
his
limbs
but
he
was
wild
wild
as
the
wild
deer
and
untaught
with
spur
and
bridle
undefiled
was
but
a
day
he
had
been
caught
and
snorting
with
erected
mane
and
struggling
fiercely
but
in
vain
in
the
full
foam
of
wrath
and
dread
to
me
the
was
led
they
bound
me
on
that
menial
throng
upon
his
back
with
many
a
thong
then
loosed
him
with
a
sudden
lash
away
away
and
on
we
dash
torrents
less
rapid
and
less
rash
away
away
my
breath
was
gone
i
saw
not
where
he
hurried
on
was
scarcely
yet
the
break
of
day
and
on
he
foamed
away
away
the
last
of
human
sounds
which
rose
as
i
was
darted
from
my
foes
was
the
wild
shout
of
savage
laughter
which
on
the
wind
came
roaring
after
a
moment
from
that
rabble
rout
with
sudden
wrath
i
wrenched
my
head
and
snapped
the
cord
which
to
the
mane
had
bound
my
neck
in
lieu
of
rein
and
writhing
half
my
form
about
howled
back
my
curse
but
midst
the
tread
the
thunder
of
my
courser
speed
perchance
they
did
not
hear
nor
heed
it
vexes
me
for
i
would
fain
have
paid
their
insult
back
again
i
paid
it
well
in
after
days
there
is
not
of
that
castle
gate
its
drawbridge
and
portcullis
weight
stone
bar
moat
bridge
or
barrier
left
nor
of
its
fields
a
blade
of
grass
save
what
grows
on
a
ridge
of
wall
where
stood
the
hearthstone
of
the
hall
and
many
a
time
ye
there
might
pass
nor
dream
that
that
fortress
was
i
saw
its
turrets
in
a
blaze
their
crackling
battlements
all
cleft
and
the
hot
lead
pour
down
like
rain
from
off
the
scorched
and
blackening
roof
whose
thickness
was
not
they
little
thought
that
day
of
pain
when
launched
as
on
the
lightning
flash
they
bade
me
to
destruction
dash
that
one
day
i
should
come
again
with
twice
five
thousand
horse
to
thank
the
count
for
his
uncourteous
ride
they
played
me
then
a
bitter
prank
when
with
the
wild
horse
for
my
guide
they
bound
me
to
his
foaming
flank
at
length
i
played
them
one
as
frank
for
time
at
last
sets
all
things
even
and
if
we
do
but
watch
the
hour
there
never
yet
was
human
power
which
could
evade
if
unforgiven
the
patient
search
and
vigil
long
of
him
who
treasures
up
a
wrong
away
away
my
steed
and
i
upon
the
pinions
of
the
wind
all
human
dwellings
left
behind
we
sped
like
meteors
through
the
sky
when
with
its
crackling
sound
the
night
is
checkered
with
the
northern
light
town
village
none
were
on
our
track
but
a
wild
plain
of
far
extent
and
bounded
by
a
forest
black
and
save
the
battlement
on
distant
heights
of
some
strong
hold
against
the
tartars
built
of
old
no
trace
of
man
the
year
before
a
turkish
army
had
marched
and
where
the
spahi
hoof
hath
trod
the
verdure
flies
the
bloody
sod
the
sky
was
dull
and
dim
and
gray
and
a
low
breeze
crept
moaning
by
i
could
have
answered
with
a
sigh
but
fast
we
fled
away
away
and
i
could
neither
sigh
nor
pray
and
my
cold
fell
like
rain
upon
the
courser
bristling
mane
but
snorting
still
with
rage
and
fear
he
flew
upon
his
far
career
at
times
i
almost
thought
indeed
he
must
have
slackened
in
his
speed
but
no
my
bound
and
slender
frame
was
nothing
to
his
angry
might
and
merely
like
a
spur
became
each
motion
which
i
made
to
free
my
swoln
limbs
from
their
agony
increased
his
fury
and
affright
i
tried
my
voice
was
faint
and
low
but
yet
he
swerved
as
from
a
blow
and
starting
to
each
accent
sprang
as
from
a
sudden
trumpet
clang
meantime
my
chords
were
wet
with
gore
which
oozing
through
my
limbs
ran
and
in
my
tongue
the
thirst
became
a
something
fierier
far
than
flame
we
neared
the
wild
wood
was
so
wide
i
saw
no
bounds
on
either
side
was
studded
with
old
sturdy
trees
that
bent
not
to
the
roughest
breeze
which
howls
down
from
siberia
waste
and
strips
the
forest
in
its
haste
but
these
were
few
and
far
between
set
thick
with
shrubs
more
young
and
green
luxuriant
with
their
annual
leaves
ere
strown
by
those
autumnal
eves
that
nip
the
forest
foliage
dead
discolored
with
a
lifeless
red
which
stands
thereon
like
stiffened
gore
upon
the
slain
when
battle
and
some
long
winter
night
hath
shed
its
frost
every
tombless
head
so
cold
and
stark
the
raven
beak
may
peck
unpierced
each
frozen
cheek
was
a
wild
waste
of
underwood
and
here
and
there
a
chestnut
stood
the
strong
oak
and
the
hardy
pine
but
far
apart
and
well
it
were
or
else
a
different
lot
were
mine
the
boughs
gave
way
and
did
not
tear
my
limbs
and
i
found
strength
to
bear
my
wounds
already
scarred
with
cold
my
bonds
forbade
to
loose
my
hold
we
rustled
through
the
leaves
like
wind
left
shrubs
and
trees
and
wolves
behind
by
night
i
heard
them
on
the
track
their
troop
came
hard
upon
our
back
with
their
long
gallop
which
can
tire
the
hound
deep
hate
and
hunter
fire
we
flew
they
followed
on
nor
left
us
with
the
morning
sun
behind
i
saw
them
scarce
a
rood
at
daybreak
winding
through
the
wood
and
through
the
night
had
heard
their
feet
their
stealing
rustling
step
repeat
o
how
i
wished
for
spear
or
sword
at
least
to
die
amidst
the
horde
and
perish
if
it
must
be
so
at
bay
destroying
many
a
foe
when
first
my
courser
race
begun
i
wished
the
goal
already
won
but
now
i
doubted
strength
and
speed
vain
doubt
his
swift
and
savage
breed
had
nerved
him
like
the
nor
faster
falls
the
blinding
snow
which
whelms
the
peasant
near
the
door
whose
threshold
he
shall
cross
no
more
bewildered
with
the
dazzling
blast
than
through
the
he
past
untired
untamed
and
worse
than
wild
all
furious
as
a
favored
child
balked
of
its
wish
or
fiercer
still
a
woman
piqued
who
has
her
will
the
wood
was
past
was
more
than
noon
but
chill
the
air
although
in
june
or
it
might
be
my
veins
ran
cold
prolonged
endurance
tames
the
bold
and
i
was
then
not
what
i
seem
but
headlong
as
a
wintry
stream
and
wore
my
feelings
out
before
i
well
could
count
their
causes
and
what
with
fury
fear
and
wrath
the
tortures
which
beset
my
path
cold
hunger
sorrow
shame
distress
thus
bound
in
nature
nakedness
sprung
from
a
race
whose
rising
blood
when
stirred
beyond
its
calmer
mood
and
trodden
hard
upon
is
like
the
rattlesnake
in
act
to
strike
what
marvel
if
this
trunk
beneath
its
woes
a
moment
sunk
the
earth
gave
way
the
skies
rolled
round
i
seemed
to
sink
upon
the
ground
but
erred
for
i
was
fastly
bound
my
heart
turned
sick
my
brain
grew
sore
and
throbbed
awhile
then
beat
no
more
the
skies
spun
like
a
mighty
wheel
i
saw
the
trees
like
drunkards
reel
and
a
slight
flash
sprang
my
eyes
which
saw
no
farther
he
who
dies
can
die
no
more
than
then
i
died
by
that
ghastly
ride
i
felt
the
blackness
come
and
go
and
strove
to
wake
but
could
not
make
my
senses
climb
up
from
below
i
felt
as
on
a
plank
at
sea
when
all
the
waves
that
dash
thee
at
the
same
time
upheave
and
whelm
and
hurl
thee
towards
a
desert
realm
my
undulating
life
was
as
the
fancied
lights
that
flitting
pass
our
shut
eyes
in
deep
midnight
when
fever
begins
upon
the
brain
but
soon
it
passed
with
little
pain
but
a
confusion
worse
than
such
i
own
that
i
should
deem
it
much
dying
to
feel
the
same
again
and
yet
i
do
suppose
we
must
feel
far
more
ere
we
turn
to
dust
no
matter
i
have
bared
my
brow
full
in
death
face
before
and
now
my
thoughts
came
back
where
was
i
cold
and
numb
and
giddy
pulse
by
pulse
life
reassumed
its
lingering
hold
and
throb
by
throb
till
grown
a
pang
which
for
a
moment
would
convulse
my
blood
reflowed
though
thick
and
chill
my
ear
with
uncouth
noises
rang
my
heart
began
once
more
to
thrill
my
sight
returned
though
dim
alas
and
thickened
as
it
were
with
glass
methought
the
dash
of
waves
was
nigh
there
was
a
gleam
too
of
the
sky
studded
with
stars
it
is
no
dream
the
wild
horse
swims
the
wilder
stream
the
bright
broad
river
gushing
tide
sweeps
winding
onward
far
and
wide
and
we
are
struggling
to
yon
unknown
and
silent
shore
the
waters
broke
my
hollow
trance
and
with
a
temporary
strength
my
stiffened
limbs
were
rebaptized
my
courser
broad
breast
proudly
braves
and
dashes
off
the
ascending
waves
and
onward
we
advance
we
reach
the
slippery
shore
at
length
a
haven
i
but
little
prized
for
all
behind
was
dark
and
drear
and
all
before
was
night
and
fear
how
many
hours
of
night
or
day
in
those
suspended
pangs
i
lay
i
could
not
tell
i
scarcely
knew
if
this
were
human
breath
i
drew
with
glossy
skin
and
dripping
mane
and
reeling
limbs
and
reeking
flank
the
wild
steed
sinewy
nerves
still
strain
up
the
repelling
bank
we
gain
the
top
a
boundless
plain
spreads
through
the
shadow
of
the
night
and
onward
onward
onward
seems
like
precipices
in
our
dreams
to
stretch
beyond
the
sight
and
here
and
there
a
speck
of
white
or
scattered
spot
of
dusky
green
in
masses
broke
into
the
light
as
rose
the
moon
upon
my
right
but
naught
distinctly
seen
in
the
dim
waste
would
indicate
the
omen
of
a
cottage
gate
no
twinkling
taper
from
afar
stood
like
a
hospitable
star
not
even
an
rose
to
make
him
merry
with
my
woes
that
very
cheat
had
cheered
me
then
although
detected
welcome
still
reminding
me
through
every
ill
of
the
abodes
of
men
onward
we
went
but
slack
and
slow
his
savage
force
at
length
the
drooping
courser
faint
and
low
all
feebly
foaming
went
a
sickly
infant
had
had
power
to
guide
him
forward
in
that
hour
but
useless
all
to
me
his
tameness
naught
availed
my
limbs
were
bound
my
force
had
failed
perchance
had
they
been
free
with
feeble
effort
still
i
tried
to
rend
the
bonds
so
starkly
tied
but
still
it
was
in
vain
my
limbs
were
only
wrung
the
more
and
soon
the
idle
strife
gave
which
but
prolonged
their
pain
the
dizzy
race
seemed
almost
done
although
no
goal
was
nearly
won
some
streaks
announced
the
coming
how
slow
alas
he
came
methought
that
mist
of
dawning
gray
would
never
dapple
into
day
how
heavily
it
rolled
away
before
the
eastern
flame
rose
crimson
and
deposed
the
stars
and
called
the
radiance
from
their
cars
and
filled
the
earth
from
his
deep
throne
with
lonely
lustre
all
his
own
up
rose
the
sun
the
mists
were
curled
back
from
the
solitary
world
which
lay
around
behind
before
what
booted
it
to
traverse
plain
forest
river
man
nor
brute
nor
dint
of
hoof
nor
print
of
foot
lay
in
the
wild
luxuriant
soil
no
sign
of
travel
none
of
toil
the
very
air
was
mute
and
not
an
insect
shrill
small
horn
nor
matin
bird
new
voice
was
borne
from
herb
nor
thicket
many
a
werst
panting
as
if
his
heart
would
burst
the
weary
brute
still
staggered
on
and
still
we
were
or
seemed
alone
at
length
while
reeling
on
our
way
methought
i
heard
a
courser
neigh
from
out
yon
tuft
of
blackening
firs
is
it
the
wind
those
branches
stirs
no
no
from
out
the
forest
prance
a
trampling
troop
i
see
them
come
in
one
vast
squadron
they
advance
i
strove
to
cry
my
lips
were
dumb
the
steeds
rush
on
in
plunging
pride
but
where
are
they
the
reins
to
guide
a
thousand
horse
and
none
to
ride
with
flowing
tail
and
flying
main
wide
nostrils
never
stretched
by
pain
mouths
bloodless
to
the
bit
or
rein
and
feet
that
iron
never
shod
and
flanks
unscarred
by
spur
or
rod
a
thousand
horse
the
wild
the
free
like
waves
that
follow
the
sea
came
thickly
thundering
on
as
if
our
faint
approach
to
meet
the
sight
renerved
my
courser
feet
a
moment
staggering
feebly
fleet
a
moment
with
a
faint
low
neigh
he
answered
and
then
fell
with
gasps
and
glazing
eyes
he
lay
and
reeking
limbs
immovable
his
first
and
last
career
is
done
on
came
the
troop
they
saw
him
stoop
they
saw
me
strangely
bound
along
his
back
with
many
a
bloody
thong
they
stop
they
start
they
snuff
the
air
gallop
a
moment
here
and
there
approach
retire
wheel
round
and
round
then
plunging
back
with
sudden
bound
headed
by
one
black
mighty
steed
who
seemed
the
patriarch
of
his
breed
without
a
single
speck
or
hair
of
white
upon
his
shaggy
hide
they
snort
they
foam
neigh
swerve
aside
and
backward
to
the
forest
fly
by
instinct
from
a
human
eye
they
left
me
there
to
my
despair
linked
to
the
dead
and
stiffening
wretch
whose
lifeless
limbs
beneath
me
stretch
relieved
from
that
unwonted
weight
from
whence
i
could
not
extricate
nor
him
nor
me
and
there
we
lay
the
dying
on
the
dead
the
giaour
ride
who
thundering
comes
on
blackest
steed
with
slackened
bit
and
hoof
of
speed
beneath
the
clattering
iron
sound
the
caverned
echoes
wake
around
in
lash
for
lash
and
bound
for
bound
the
foam
that
streaks
the
courser
side
seems
gathered
from
the
though
weary
waves
are
sunk
to
rest
there
none
within
his
rider
breast
and
though
tempest
lower
is
calmer
than
thy
heart
young
giaour
i
know
thee
not
i
loathe
thy
race
but
in
thy
lineaments
i
trace
what
time
shall
strengthen
not
efface
though
young
and
pale
that
sallow
front
is
scathed
by
fiery
passion
brunt
though
bent
on
earth
thine
evil
eye
as
thou
glidest
by
right
well
i
view
and
deem
thee
one
whom
othman
sons
should
slay
or
shun
on
on
he
hastened
and
he
drew
my
gaze
of
wonder
as
he
flew
though
like
a
demon
of
the
night
he
passed
and
vanished
from
my
sight
his
aspect
and
his
air
impressed
a
troubled
memory
on
my
breast
and
long
upon
my
startled
ear
rung
his
dark
courser
hoofs
of
fear
he
spurs
his
steed
he
nears
the
steep
that
jutting
shadows
the
deep
he
winds
around
he
hurries
by
the
rock
relieves
him
from
mine
eye
for
well
i
ween
unwelcome
he
whose
glance
is
fixed
on
those
that
flee
and
not
a
star
but
shines
too
bright
on
him
who
takes
such
timeless
flight
he
wound
along
but
ere
he
passed
one
glance
he
snatched
as
if
his
last
a
moment
checked
his
wheeling
steed
a
moment
breathed
him
from
his
speed
a
moment
on
his
stirrup
stood
why
looks
he
the
olive
wood
the
crescent
glimmers
on
the
hill
the
mosque
high
lamps
are
quivering
still
though
too
remote
for
sound
to
wake
in
echoes
of
the
far
tophaike
the
flashes
of
each
joyous
peal
are
seen
to
prove
the
moslem
zeal
set
rhamazani
sun
the
bairam
feast
begun
but
who
and
what
art
thou
of
foreign
garb
and
fearful
brow
and
what
are
these
to
thine
or
thee
that
thou
either
pause
or
flee
he
stood
some
dread
was
on
his
face
soon
hatred
settled
in
its
place
it
rose
not
with
the
reddening
flush
of
transient
anger
hasty
blush
but
pale
as
marble
the
tomb
whose
ghastly
whiteness
aids
its
gloom
his
brow
was
bent
his
eye
was
glazed
he
raised
his
arm
and
fiercely
raised
and
sternly
shook
his
hand
on
high
as
doubting
to
return
or
fly
impatient
of
his
flight
delayed
here
loud
his
raven
charger
neighed
down
glanced
that
hand
and
grasped
his
blade
that
sound
had
burst
his
waking
dream
as
slumber
starts
at
owlet
scream
the
spur
hath
lanced
his
courser
sides
away
away
for
life
he
rides
swift
as
the
hurled
on
high
jerreed
springs
to
the
touch
his
startled
steed
the
rock
is
doubled
and
the
shore
shakes
with
the
clattering
tramp
no
more
the
crag
is
won
no
more
is
seen
his
christian
crest
and
haughty
mien
was
but
an
instant
he
restrained
that
fiery
barb
so
sternly
reined
was
but
a
moment
that
he
stood
then
sped
as
if
by
death
pursued
but
in
that
instant
his
soul
winters
of
memory
seemed
to
roll
and
gather
in
that
drop
of
time
a
life
of
pain
an
age
of
crime
him
who
loves
or
hates
or
fears
such
moment
pours
the
grief
of
years
what
felt
then
at
once
opprest
by
all
that
most
distracts
the
breast
that
pause
which
pondered
his
fate
oh
who
its
dreary
length
shall
date
though
in
time
record
nearly
nought
it
was
eternity
to
thought
for
infinite
as
boundless
space
the
thought
that
conscience
must
embrace
which
in
itself
can
comprehend
woe
without
name
or
hope
or
end
the
hour
is
past
the
giaour
is
gone
and
did
he
fly
or
fall
alone
woe
to
that
hour
he
came
or
went
the
curse
of
hassan
sin
was
sent
to
turn
a
palace
to
a
tomb
he
came
he
went
like
the
simoom
that
harbinger
of
fate
and
gloom
beneath
whose
breath
the
very
cypress
droops
to
death
dark
tree
still
sad
when
others
grief
is
fled
the
only
constant
mourner
the
dead
the
norseman
ride
the
frosty
fires
of
northern
starlight
gleamed
on
the
glittering
snow
and
through
the
forest
frozen
branches
the
shrieking
winds
did
blow
a
floor
of
blue
translucent
marble
kept
ocean
pulses
still
when
in
the
depth
of
dreary
midnight
opened
the
burial
hill
then
while
a
low
and
creeping
shudder
thrilled
upward
through
the
ground
the
norseman
came
as
armed
for
battle
in
silence
from
his
mound
he
who
was
mourned
in
solemn
sorrow
by
many
a
swordsman
bold
and
harps
that
wailed
along
the
ocean
struck
by
the
skalds
of
old
sudden
a
swift
and
silver
shadow
rushed
up
from
out
the
gloom
a
horse
that
stamped
with
hoof
impatient
yet
noiseless
on
the
tomb
ha
surtur
let
me
hear
thy
tramping
thou
noblest
northern
steed
whose
neigh
along
the
stormy
headlands
bade
the
bold
viking
heed
he
mounted
like
a
streaking
the
sky
with
flaming
bars
they
on
the
winds
so
wildly
shrieking
shot
up
before
the
stars
is
this
thy
mane
my
fearless
surtur
that
streams
against
my
breast
is
this
thy
neck
that
curve
of
moonlight
which
helva
hand
caressed
no
misty
breathing
strains
thy
nostril
thine
eye
shines
blue
and
cold
yet
mounting
up
our
airy
pathway
i
see
thy
hoofs
of
gold
not
lighter
the
springing
rainbow

than
we
in
sweeping

over
the
bending

around

sparkling
amid
the

and
earth
that

so
cold

veiled
her
dusky

are
those
the
nornes
that
beckon
onward
to
seats
at
odin

where
nightly
by
the
hands
of
heroes
the
foaming
mead
is
poured
is
skuld
her
speaks
the
glory
that
waits
the
warrior
soul
when
on
its

opens
the
gateway
of

when

leads
the

like

that
was

my
chestnut
broke
it
was
just
five
miles
from
salisbury
town
and
but
one
hour
to
day
thud
thud
came
on
the
heavy
roan
rap
rap
the
mettled
gray
but
my
chestnut
mare
was
of
blood
so
rare
that
she
showed
them
all
the
way
spur
on
spur
on
i
doffed
my
hat
and
wished
them
all
good
day
they
splashed
through
miry
rut
and
pool
splintered
through
fence
and
rail
but
chestnut
kate
switched
over
the
gate
i
saw
them
droop
and
tail
to
salisbury
town
but
a
mile
of
down
once
over
this
brook
and
rail
trap
trap
i
heard
their
echoing
hoofs
past
the
walls
of
mossy
stone
the
roan
flew
on
at
a
staggering
pace
but
blood
is
better
than
bone
i
patted
old
kate
and
gave
her
the
spur
for
i
knew
it
was
all
my
own
but
trample
trample
came
their
steeds
and
i
saw
their
wolfs
eyes
burn
i
felt
like
a
royal
hart
at
bay
and
made
me
ready
to
turn
i
looked
where
highest
grew
the
may
and
deepest
arched
the
fern
i
flew
at
the
first
knave
sallow
throat
one
blow
and
he
was
down
the
second
rogue
fired
twice
and
missed
i
sliced
the
villain
crown
clove
through
the
rest
and
flogged
brave
kate
fast
fast
to
salisbury
town
pad
pad
they
came
on
the
level
sward
thud
thud
upon
the
sand
with
a
gleam
of
swords
and
a
burning
match
and
a
shaking
of
flag
and

but
one
long
bound
and
i
passed
the

safe
from

king
james
ride

bayard

the
steed
obeyed
with
arching
neck
and
bending
head
and
glancing
eye
and
quivering
ear
as
if
he
loved
his
lord
to
hear
no
foot
in
stirrup
staid
no
grasp
upon
the
saddle
laid
but
wreathed
his
left
hand
in
the
mane
and
lightly
bounded
from
the
plain
turned
on
the
horse
his
armed
heel
and
stirred
his
courage
with
the
steel
bounded
the
fiery
steed
in
air
the
rider
sate
erect
and
fair
then
like
a
bolt
from
steel
crossbow
forth
launched
along
the
plain
they
go
they
dashed
that
rapid
torrent
through
and
up
carhonie
hill
they
flew
still
at
the
gallop
pricked
the
knight
his
followed
as
they
might
along
thy

swift
teith
they
ride
and
in
the
race
they
mocked
thy

torry
and
lendrick
now
are
past
and
deanstown
lies
behind
them
cast
they
rise
the
bannered
towers
of
doune
they
sink
in
distant
woodland
soon
sees
the
hoof
strike
fire
they
sweep
like
breeze
through
ochtertyre
they
mark
just
glance
and
disappear
the
lofty
brow
of
ancient
kier
they
bathe
their
courser
sweltering
sides
dark
forth
amid
thy
sluggish
tides
and
on
the
opposing
shore
take
ground
with
plash
with
scramble
and
with
bound
they
leave
thy
cliffs
and
soon
the
bulwark
of
the
north
grey
stirling
with
her
towers
and
town
upon
their
fleet
career
looked
down
deloraine
ride
the

forgot
her
purpose
high
one
moment
and
no

one
moment
gazed
with
a
mother
eye
as
she
paused
at
the
arched
door
then
from
amid
the
armed
train
she
called
to
her
william

a
stark
scott
was
he
as
couched
border
lance
by

through

through

in

sate
he
fast
and
soon
the
steep
descent
he
past
soon
crossed
the
sounding
barbican
and
soon
the
teviot
side
he
won
eastward
the
wooded
path
he
rode
green
hazels
his
basnet
nod
he
passed
the
peel
of
goldiland
and
crossed
old
borthwick
roaring
strand
dimly
he
viewed
the
mound
where
druid
shades
still
flitted
round
in
hawick
twinkled
many
a
light
behind
him
soon
they
set
in
night
and
soon
he
spurred
his
courser

beneath
the

clattering

mark

ho
thou
courier
of

the
knight
rejoined
and
left
the
friendly
tower
behind
he
turned
him
now
from
teviotside
and
guided
by
the
tinkling
rill
northward
the
dark
ascent
did
ride
and
gained
the
moor
at
horsliehill
broad
on
the
left
before
him
lay
for
many
a
mile
the
roman
way
a
moment
now
he
slacked
his
speed
a
moment
breathed
his
panting
steed
drew
and
and
loosened
in
the
sheath
his
brand
on
the
moonbeams
glint
where
barnhill
hewed
his
bed
of
flint
who
flung
his
outlawed
limbs
to
rest
where
falcons
hang
their
giddy
nest
mid
cliffs
from
whence
his
eagle
eye
for
many
a
league
his
prey
could
spy
cliffs
doubling
on
their
echoes
borne
the
terrors
of
the
robber
horn
cliffs
which
for
many
a
later
year
the
warbling
doric
reed
shall
hear
when
some
sad
swain
shall
teach
the
grove
ambition
is
no
cure
for
love
unchallenged
thence
passed
deloraine
to
ancient
riddel
fair
domain
where
aill
from
mountains
freed
down
from
the
lakes
did
raving
come
each
wave
was
crested
with
tawny
foam
like
the
mane
of
a
chestnut
steed
in
vain
no
torrent
deep
or
broad
might
bar
the
bold
road
at
the
first
plunge
the
horse
sunk
low
and
the
water
broke
the
saddlebow
above
the
foaming
tide
i
ween
scarce
half
the
charger
neck
was
seen
for
he
was
barded
from
counter
to
tail
and
the
rider
was
armed
complete
in
mail
never
heavier
man
and
horse
stemmed
a
midnight
torrent
force
the
warrior
very
plume
i
say
was
daggled
by
the
dashing
spray
yet
through
good
heart
and
our
ladye
grace
at
length
he
gained
the
landing
place
now
bowden
moor
the
won
and
sternly
shook
his
plumed
head
as
glanced
his
eye
halidon
for
on
his
soul
the
slaughter
red
of
that
unhallowed
morn
arose
when
first
the
scott
and
carr
were
foes
when
royal
james
beheld
the
fray
prize
to
the
victor
of
the
day
when

retiring
clan
till
gallant
cessford
dear
reeked
on
dark
elliot
border
spear
in
bitter
mood
he
spurred
fast
and
soon
the
hated
heath
was
past
and
far
beneath
in
lustre
wan
old
melros
rose
and
fair
tweed
ran
like
some
tall
rock
with
lichens
gray
seemed
dimly
huge
the
dark
abbaye
when
hawick
he
passed
had
curfew
rung
now
midnight
lauds
were
in
melrose
sung
the
sound
upon
the
fitful
gale
in
solemn
wise
did
rise
and
fail
like
that
wild
harp
whose
magic
tone
is
wakened
by
the
winds
alone
but
when
melrose
he
reached
was
silence
all
he
meetly
stabled
his
steed
in
stall
and
sought
the
convent
lonely
wall
walter
godiva
waited
for
the
train
at
coventry
i
hung
with
grooms
and
porters
on
the
bridge
to
watch
the
three
tall
spires
and
there
i
shaped
the
city
ancient
legend
into
not
only
we
the
latest
seed
of
time
new
men
that
in
the
flying
of
a
wheel
cry
down
the
past
not
only
we
that
prate
of
rights
and
wrongs
have
loved
the
people
well
and
loathed
to
see
them
overtaxed
but
she
did
more
and
underwent
and
overcame
the
woman
of
a
thousand
summers
back
godiva
wife
to
that
grim
earl
who
ruled
in
coventry
for
when
he
laid
a
tax
upon
his
town
and
all
the
mothers
brought
their
children
clamoring
if
we
pay
we
starve
she
sought
her
lord
and
found
him
where
he
strode
about
the
hall
among
his
dogs
alone
his
beard
a
foot
before
him
and
his
hair
a
yard
behind
she
told
him
of
their
tears
and
prayed
him
if
they
pay
this
tax
they
starve
whereat
he
stared
replying
you
would
not
let
your
little
finger
ache
for
such
as
but
i
would
die
said
she
he
laughed
and
swore
by
peter
and
by
paul
then
filliped
at
the
diamond
in
her
ear
o
ay
ay
ay
you
talk
alas
she
said
but
prove
me
what
it
is
i
would
not
do
and
from
a
heart
as
rough
as
esau
hand
he
answered
ride
you
naked
through
the
town
and
i
repeal
it
and
nodding
as
in
scorn
he
parted
with
great
strides
among
his
dogs
so
left
alone
the
passions
of
her
mind
as
winds
from
all
the
compass
shift
and
blow
made
war
upon
each
other
for
an
hour
till
pity
won
she
sent
a
herald
forth
and
bade
him
cry
with
sound
of
trumpet
all
the
hard
condition
but
that
she
would
loose
the
people
therefore
as
they
loved
her
well
from
then
till
noon
no
foot
should
pace
the
street
no
eye
look
down
she
passing
but
that
all
should
keep
within
door
shut
and
window
barred
then
fled
she
to
her
inmost
bower
and
there
unclasped
the
wedded
eagles
of
her
belt
the
grim
earl
gift
but
ever
at
a
breath
she
lingered
looking
like
a
summer
moon
in
cloud
anon
she
shook
her
head
and
showered
the
rippled
ringlets
to
her
knee
unclad
herself
in
haste
adown
the
stair
stole
on
and
like
a
creeping
sunbeam
slid
from
pillar
unto
pillar
until
she
reached
the
gateway
there
she
found
her
palfrey
trapt
in
purple
blazoned
with
armorial
gold
then
she
rode
forth
clothed
on
with
chastity
the
deep
air
listened
round
her
as
she
rode
and
all
the
low
wind
hardly
breathed
for
fear
the
little
heads
upon
the
spout
had
cunning
eyes
to
see
the
barking
cur
made
her
cheek
flame
her
palfrey
footfall
shot
light
horrors
through
her
pulses
the
blind
walls
were
full
of
chinks
and
holes
and
overhead
fantastic
gables
crowding
stared
but
she
not
less
through
all
bore
up
till
last
she
saw
the
from
the
field
gleam
through
the
gothic
archways
in
the
wall
then
she
rode
back
clothed
on
with
chastity
and
one
low
churl
compact
of
thankless
earth
the
fatal
byword
of
all
years
to
come
boring
a
little
in
fear
peeped
but
his
eyes
before
they
had
their
will
were
shrivelled
into
darkness
in
his
head
and
dropt
before
him
so
the
powers
who
wait
on
noble
deeds
cancelled
a
sense
misused
and
she
that
knew
not
passed
and
all
at
once
with
twelve
great
shocks
of
sound
the
shameless
noon
was
clashed
and
hammered
from
a
hundred
towers
one
after
one
but
even
then
she
gained
her
bower
whence
reissuing
robed
and
crowned
to
meet
her
lord
she
took
the
tax
away
and
built
herself
an
everlasting
name
how
they
brought
the
good
news
from
ghent
to
aix
i
sprang
to
the
stirrup
and
joris
and
he
i
galloped
dirck
galloped
we
galloped
all
three
good
speed
cried
the
watch
as
the
undrew
speed
echoed
the
wall
to
us
galloping
through
behind
shut
the
postern
the
lights
sank
to
rest
and
into
the
midnight
we
galloped
abreast
not
a
word
to
each
other
we
kept
the
great
pace
neck
by
neck
stride
by
stride
never
changing
our
place
i
turned
in
my
saddle
and
made
its
girths
tight
rebuckled
the
chained
slacker
the
bit
then
shortened
each
stirrup
and
set
the
pique
right
nor
galloped
less
steadily
roland
a
whit
was
moonset
at
starting
but
while
we
drew
near
lokeren
the
cocks
crew
and
twilight
dawned
clear
at
boom
a
great
yellow
star
came
out
to
see
at
düffeld
was
morning
as
plain
as
could
be
and
from
mecheln
we
heard
the
so
joris
broke
silence
with
yet
there
is
time
at
aerschot
up
leaped
of
a
sudden
the
sun
and
against
him
the
cattle
stood
black
every
one
to
stare
through
the
mist
at
us
galloping
past
and
i
saw
my
stout
galloper
roland
at
last
with
resolute
shoulders
each
butting
away
the
haze
as
some
bluff
river
headland
its
spray
and
his
low
head
and
crest
just
one
sharp
ear
bent
back
for
my
voice
and
the
other
pricked
out
on
his
track
and
one
eye
black
intelligence
ever
that
glance
its
white
edge
at
me
his
own
master
askance
and
the
thick
heavy
which
aye
and
anon
his
fierce
lips
shook
upwards
in
galloping
on
by
hasselt
dirck
groaned
and
cried
joris
stay
spur
your
roos
galloped
bravely
the
fault
not
in
her
we
remember
at
aix
for
one
heard
the
quick
wheeze
of
her
chest
saw
the
stretched
neck
and
staggering
knees
and
sunk
tail
and
horrible
heave
of
the
flank
as
down
on
her
haunches
she
shuddered
and
sank
so
we
were
left
galloping
joris
and
i
past
looz
and
past
tongres
no
cloud
in
the
sky
the
broad
sun
above
laughed
a
pitiless
laugh
our
feet
broke
the
brittle
bright
stubble
like
chaff
till
over
by
dalhem
a
sprang
white
and
gallop
gasped
joris
for
aix
is
in
sight
how
they
greet
us
and
all
in
a
moment
his
roan
rolled
neck
and
croup
over
lay
dead
as
a
stone
and
there
was
my
roland
to
bear
the
whole
weight
of
the
news
which
alone
could
save
aix
from
her
fate
with
his
nostrils
like
pits
full
of
blood
to
the
brim
and
with
circles
of
red
for
his
rim
then
i
cast
loose
my
each
holster
let
fall
shook
off
both
my
let
go
belt
and
all
stood
up
in
the
stirrup
leaned
patted
his
ear
called
my
roland
his
my
horse
without
peer
clapped
my
hands
laughed
and
sang
any
noise
bad
or
good
till
at
length
into
aix
roland
galloped
and
stood
and
all
i
remember
is
friends
flocking
round
as
i
sat
with
his
head
my
knees
on
the
ground
and
no
voice
but
was
praising
this
roland
of
mine
as
i
poured
down
his
throat
our
last
measure
of
wine
which
the
burgesses
voted
by
common
consent
was
no
more
than
his
due
who
brought
good
news
from
ghent
the
landlord
tale
paul
revere
ride
listen
my
children
and
you
shall
hear
of
the
midnight
ride
of
paul
revere
on
the
eighteenth
of
april
in
hardly
a
man
is
now
alive
who
remembers
that
famous
day
and
year
he
said
to
his
friend
if
the
british
march
by
land
or
sea
from
the
town
hang
a
lantern
aloft
in
the
belfry
arch
of
the
north
church
tower
as
a
signal
light
one
if
by
land
and
two
if
by
sea
and
i
on
the
opposite
shore
will
be
ready
to
ride
and
spread
the
alarm
through
every
middlesex
village
and
farm
for
the
country
folk
to
be
up
and
to
arm
then
he
said
good
night
and
with
muffled
oar
silently
rowed
to
the
charlestown
shore
just
as
the
moon
rose
over
the
bay
where
swinging
wide
at
her
moorings
lay
the
somerset
british
a
phantom
ship
with
each
mast
and
spar
across
the
moon
like
a
prison
bar
and
a
huge
black
hulk
that
was
magnified
by
its
own
reflection
in
the
tide
meanwhile
his
friend
through
alley
and
street
wanders
and
watches
with
eager
ears
till
in
the
silence
around
him
he
hears
the
muster
of
men
at
the
barrack
door
the
sound
of
arms
and
the
tramp
of
feet
and
the
measured
tread
of
the
grenadiers
marching
down
to
their
boats
on
the
shore
then
he
climbed
the
tower
of
the
old
north
church
by
the
wooden
stairs
with
stealthy
tread
to
the
overhead
and
startled
the
pigeons
from
their
perch
on
the
sombre
rafters
that
round
him
made
masses
and
moving
shapes
of
shade
by
the
trembling
ladder
steep
and
tall
to
the
highest
window
in
the
wall
where
he
paused
to
listen
and
look
down
a
moment
on
the
roofs
of
the
town
and
the
moonlight
flowing
over
all
beneath
in
the
churchyard
lay
the
dead
in
their
on
the
hill
wrapped
in
silence
so
deep
and
still
that
he
could
hear
like
a
sentinel
tread
the
watchful
as
it
went
creeping
along
from
tent
to
tent
and
seeming
to
whisper
all
is
well
a
moment
only
he
feels
the
spell
of
the
place
and
hour
and
the
secret
dread
of
the
lonely
belfry
and
the
dead
for
suddenly
all
his
thoughts
are
bent
on
a
shadowy
something
far
away
where
the
river
widens
to
meet
the
bay
a
line
of
black
that
bends
and
floats
on
the
rising
tide
like
a
bridge
of
boats
meanwhile
impatient
to
mount
and
ride
booted
and
spurred
with
a
heavy
stride
on
the
opposite
shore
walked
paul
revere
now
he
patted
his
horse
side
now
gazed
at
the
landscape
far
and
near
then
impetuous
stamped
the
earth
and
turned
and
tightened
his
but
mostly
he
watched
with
eager
search
the
of
the
old
north
church
as
it
rose
above
the
graves
on
the
hill
lonely
and
spectral
and
sombre
and
still
and
lo
as
he
looks
on
the
belfry
height
a
glimmer
and
then
a
gleam
of
light
he
springs
to
the
saddle
the
bridle
he
turns
but
lingers
and
gazes
till
full
on
his
sight
a
second
lamp
in
the
belfry
burns
a
hurry
of
hoofs
in
a
village
street
a
shape
in
the
moonlight
a
bulk
in
the
dark
and
beneath
from
the
pebbles
in
passing
a
spark
struck
out
by
a
steed
flying
fearless
and
fleet
that
was
all
and
yet
through
the
gloom
and
the
light
the
fate
of
a
nation
was
riding
that
night
and
the
spark
struck
out
by
that
steed
in
his
flight
kindled
the
land
into
flame
with
its
heat
he
has
left
the
village
and
mounted
the
steep
and
beneath
him
tranquil
and
broad
and
deep
is
the
mystic
meeting
the
ocean
tides
and
under
the
alders
that
skirt
its
edge
now
soft
on
the
sand
now
loud
on
the
ledge
is
heard
the
tramp
of
his
steed
as
he
rides
it
was
twelve
by
the
village
clock
when
he
crossed
the
bridge
into
medford
town
he
heard
the
crowing
of
the
cock
and
the
barking
of
the
farmer
dog
and
felt
the
damp
of
the
river
fog
that
rises
after
the
sun
goes
down
it
was
one
by
the
village
clock
when
he
galloped
into
lexington
he
saw
the
gilded
weathercock
swim
in
the
moonlight
as
he
passed
and
the
windows
blank
and
bare
gaze
at
him
with
a
spectral
glare
as
if
they
already
stood
aghast
at
the
bloody
work
they
would
look
upon
it
was
two
by
the
village
clock
when
he
came
to
the
bridge
in
concord
town
he
heard
the
bleating
of
the
flock
and
the
twitter
of
birds
among
the
trees
and
felt
the
breath
of
the
morning
breeze
blowing
over
the
meadows
brown
and
one
was
safe
and
asleep
in
his
bed
who
at
the
bridge
would
be
first
to
fall
who
that
day
would
be
lying
dead
pierced
by
a
british
you
know
the
rest
in
the
books
you
have
read
how
the
british
regulars
fired
and
fled
how
the
farmers
gave
them
ball
for
ball
from
behind
each
fence
and
wall
chasing
the
down
the
lane
then
crossing
the
fields
to
emerge
again
under
the
trees
at
the
turn
of
the
road
and
only
pausing
to
fire
and
load
so
through
the
night
rode
paul
revere
and
so
through
the
night
went
his
cry
of
alarm
to
every
middlesex
village
and
farm
a
cry
of
defiance
and
not
of
fear
a
voice
in
the
darkness
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
word
that
shall
echo
forevermore
for
borne
on
the
of
the
past
through
all
our
history
to
the
last
in
the
hour
of
darkness
and
peril
and
need
the
people
will
waken
and
listen
to
hear
the
hurrying
of
that
steed
and
the
midnight
message
of
paul
revere
sheridan
ride
up
from
the
south
at
break
of
day
bringing
to
winchester
fresh
dismay
the
affrighted
air
with
a
shudder
bore
like
a
herald
in
haste
to
the
chieftain
door
the
terrible
grumble
and
rumble
and
roar
telling
the
battle
was
on
once
more
and
sheridan
twenty
miles
away
and
wider
still
those
billows
of
war
thundered
along
the
horizon
bar
and
louder
yet
into
winchester
rolled
the
roar
of
that
red
sea
uncontrolled
making
the
blood
of
the
listener
cold
as
he
thought
of
the
stake
in
that
fiery
fray
and
sheridan
twenty
miles
away
but
there
is
a
road
from
winchester
town
a
good
broad
highway
leading
down
and
there
through
the
flush
of
the
morning
light
a
steed
as
black
as
the
steeds
of
night
was
seen
to
pass
as
with
eagle
flight
as
if
he
knew
the
terrible
need
he
stretched
away
with
his
utmost
speed
hills
rose
and
fell
but
his
heart
was
gay
with
sheridan
fifteen
miles
away
still
sprung
from
those
swift
hoofs
thundering
south
the
dust
like
smoke
from
the
cannon
mouth
or
the
trail
of
a
comet
sweeping
faster
and
faster
foreboding
to
traitors
the
doom
of
disaster
the
heart
of
the
steed
and
the
heart
of
the
master
were
beating
like
prisoners
assaulting
their
walls
impatient
to
be
where
the
calls
every
nerve
of
the
charger
was
strained
to
full
play
with
sheridan
only
ten
miles
away
under
his
spurning
feet
the
road
like
an
arrowy
alpine
river
flowed
and
the
landscape
sped
away
behind
like
an
ocean
flying
before
the
wind
and
the
steed
like
a
bark
fed
with
furnace
fire
swept
on
with
his
wild
eye
full
of
ire
but
lo
he
is
nearing
his
heart
desire
he
is
snuffing
the
smoke
of
the
roaring
fray
with
sheridan
only
five
miles
away
the
first
that
the
general
saw
were
the
groups
of
stragglers
and
then
the
retreating
troops
what
was
done
what
to
do
a
glance
told
him
both
then
striking
his
spurs
with
a
terrible
oath
he
dashed
down
the
line
mid
a
storm
of
huzzas
and
the
wave
of
retreat
checked
its
course
there
because
the
sight
of
the
master
compelled
it
to
pause
with
foam
and
with
dust
the
black
charger
was
gray
by
the
flash
of
his
eye
and
the
red
nostril
play
he
seemed
to
the
whole
great
army
to
say
i
have
brought
you
sheridan
all
the
way
from
winchester
down
to
save
the
day
hurrah
hurrah
for
sheridan
hurrah
hurrah
for
horse
and
man
and
when
their
statues
are
placed
on
high
under
the
dome
of
the
union
sky
the
american
soldiers
temple
of
fame
there
with
the
glorious
general
name
be
it
said
in
letters
both
bold
and
bright
here
is
the
steed
that
saved
the
day
by
carrying
sheridan
into
the
fight
from
winchester
twenty
miles
away
buchanan
kearny
at
seven
pines
so
that
soldierly
legend
is
still
on
its
journey
that
story
of
kearny
who
knew
not
to
yield
was
the
day
when
with
jameson
fierce
berry
and
birney
against
twenty
thousand
he
rallied
the
field
where
the
red
volleys
poured
where
the
clamor
rose
highest
where
the
dead
lay
in
clumps
through
the
dwarf
oak
and
pine
where
the
aim
from
the
thicket
was
surest
and
nighest
no
charge
like
phil
kearny
along
the
whole
line
when
the
battle
went
ill
and
the
bravest
were
solemn
near
the
dark
seven
pines
where
we
still
held
our
ground
he
rode
down
the
length
of
the
withering
column
and
his
heart
at
our
leapt
up
with
a
bound
he
snuffed
like
his
charger
the
wind
of
the
powder
his
sword
waved
us
on
and
we
answered
the
sign
loud
our
cheers
as
we
rushed
but
his
laugh
rang
the
louder
there
the
devil
own
fun
boys
along
the
whole
line
how
he
strode
his
brown
steed
how
we
saw
his
blade
brighten
in
the
one
hand
still
left
and
the
reins
in
his
teeth
he
laughed
like
a
boy
when
the
holidays
heighten
but
a
soldier
glance
shot
from
his
visor
beneath
up
came
the
reserves
to
the
mellay
infernal
asking
where
to
go
in
through
the
clearing
or
pine
oh
anywhere
forward
is
all
the
same
colonel
you
find
lovely
fighting
along
the
whole
line
oh
evil
the
black
shroud
of
night
at
chantilly
that
hid
him
from
sight
of
his
brave
men
and
tried
foul
foul
sped
the
bullet
that
clipped
the
white
lily
the
flower
of
our
knighthood
the
whole
army
pride
yet
we
dream
that
he
still
in
that
shadowy
region
where
the
dead
form
their
ranks
at
the
wan
drummer
sign
rides
on
as
of
old
down
the
length
of
his
legion
and
the
word
still
is
forward
along
the
whole
line
clarence
the
ride
of
collins
graves
an
incident
of
the
flood
in
massachusetts
on
may
no
song
of
a
soldier
riding
down
to
the
raging
fight
from
winchester
town
no
song
of
a
time
that
shook
the
earth
with
the
nations
throe
at
a
nation
birth
but
the
song
of
a
brave
man
free
from
fear
as
sheridan
self
or
paul
revere
who
risked
what
they
risked
free
from
strife
and
its
promise
of
glorious
pay
his
life
the
peaceful
valley
has
waked
and
stirred
and
the
answering
echoes
of
life
are
heard
the
dew
still
clings
to
the
trees
and
grass
and
the
early
toilers
smiling
pass
as
they
glance
aside
at
the
homes
or
up
the
valley
where
merrily
comes
the
brook
that
sparkles
in
diamond
rills
as
the
sun
comes
over
the
hampshire
hills
what
was
it
that
passed
like
an
ominous
breath
like
a
shiver
of
fear
or
a
touch
of
death
what
was
it
the
valley
is
peaceful
still
and
the
leaves
are
afire
on
top
of
the
hill
it
was
not
a
sound
nor
a
thing
of
sense
but
a
pain
like
the
pang
of
the
short
suspense
that
thrills
the
being
of
those
who
see
at
their
feet
the
gulf
of
eternity
the
air
of
the
valley
has
felt
the
chill
the
workers
pause
at
the
door
of
the
mill
the
housewife
keen
to
the
shivering
air
arrests
her
foot
on
the
cottage
stair
instinctive
taught
by
the
and
thinks
of
the
sleeping
ones
above
why
start
the
listeners
why
does
the
course
of
the
widen
is
it
a
horse
hark
to
the
sound
of
his
hoofs
they
say
that
gallops
so
wildly
williamsburg
way
god
what
was
that
like
a
human
shriek
from
the
winding
valley
will
nobody
speak
will
nobody
answer
those
women
who
cry
as
the
awful
warnings
thunder
by
whence
come
they
listen
and
now
they
hear
the
sound
of
the
galloping
near
they
watch
the
trend
of
the
vale
and
see
the
rider
who
thunders
so
menacingly
with
waving
arms
and
warning
scream
to
the
banks
of
the
valley
stream
he
draws
no
rein
but
he
shakes
the
street
with
a
shout
and
the
ring
of
the
galloping
feet
and
this
the
cry
he
flings
to
the
wind
to
the
hills
for
your
lives
the
flood
is
behind
he
cries
and
is
gone
but
they
know
the
worst
the
breast
of
the
williamsburg
dam
has
burst
the
basin
that
nourished
their
happy
homes
is
changed
to
a
demon
it
comes
it
comes
a
monster
in
aspect
with
shaggy
front
of
shattered
dwellings
to
take
the
brunt
of
the
homes
they
shatter
and
hoarse
the
merciless
terror
fills
the
course
of
the
narrow
valley
and
rushing
raves
with
death
on
the
first
of
its
hissing
waves
till
cottage
and
street
and
crowded
mill
are
crumbled
and
crushed
but
onward
still
in
front
of
the
roaring
flood
is
heard
the
galloping
horse
and
the
warning
word
thank
god
the
brave
man
life
is
spared
from
williamsburg
town
he
nobly
dared
to
race
with
the
flood
and
take
the
road
in
front
of
the
terrible
swath
it
mowed
for
miles
it
thundered
and
crashed
behind
but
he
looked
ahead
with
a
steadfast
mind
they
must
be
warned
was
all
he
said
as
away
on
his
terrible
ride
he
sped
when
heroes
are
called
for
bring
the
crown
to
this
yankee
rider
send
him
down
on
the
stream
of
time
with
the
curtius
old
his
deed
as
the
roman
was
brave
and
bold
and
the
tale
can
as
noble
a
thrill
awake
for
he
offered
his
life
for
the
people
sake
boyle
a
tale
of
providence
the
tall
green
tree
its
shadow
cast
upon
howe
army
that
southward
passed
from
gordon
ford
to
the
quaker
town
intending
in
quarters
to
settle
down
till
snows
were
gone
and
spring
again
should
easier
make
a
new
campaign
beyond
the
fences
that
lined
the
way
the
fields
of
captain
richardson
lay
his
woodland
and
meadows
reached
far
and
wide
from
the
hills
behind
to
the
schuylkill
side
across
the
stream
in
the
mountain
gorge
he
could
see
the
smoke
of
the
valley
forge
the
captain
had
fought
in
the
frontier
war
when
the
fight
was
done
bearing
seam
and
scar
he
marched
back
home
to
tread
once
more
the
same
tame
round
he
had
trod
before
and
turn
his
thoughts
with
sighs
of
regret
to
his
ploughshares
wishing
them
yet
he
put
the
meadow
in
corn
that
year
and
swore
till
his
blacks
were
white
with
fear
he
plowed
and
planted
and
married
a
wife
but
life
grew
weary
with
inward
strife
his
blood
was
hot
and
his
throbbing
brain
beat
with
the
surf
of
some
far
main
should
he
sack
a
town
or
rob
the
mail
or
on
the
wide
seas
a
pirate
sail
he
pondered
it
over
concluding
instead
to
buy
three
steeds
in
arabia
bred
on
sopus
fearnaught
or
scipio
he
felt
his
blood
more
evenly
flow
to
his
daughter
tacey
the
coming
days
brought
health
and
beauty
and
graceful
ways
he
taught
her
to
ride
his
fleetest
steed
at
a
fence
or
a
ditch
at
need
and
the
captain
horses
his
hounds
and
his
child
were
famous
from
sea
to
forests
wild
master
and
man
from
home
were
gone
and
fearnaught
held
the
stables
alone
and
mistress
tacey
her
spirit
showed
the
morning
the
british
came
down
the
road
she
hid
the
silver
and
drove
the
cows
to
the
island
behind
the
willow
boughs
was
time
too
short
or
did
she
forget
that
fearnaught
stood
in
the
stables
yet
across
the
fields
to
the
gate
she
ran
and
followed
the
path
the
span
on
the
doorstep
she
paused
and
turned
to
see
the
head
of
the
line
beneath
the
green
tree
the
last
straggler
passed
the
night
came
on
and
then
was
discovered
that
fearnaught
was
gone
sometime
somehow
from
his
stall
he
was
led
where
an
old
gray
horse
was
left
in
his
stead
and
tacey
must
prove
to
her
father
that
she
had
been
prepared
for
the
emergency
for
the
words
he
scattered
on
kind
soil
fell
and
tacey
had
learned
his
maxim
well
in
the
stories
he
read
she
remembered
the
art
that
concealed
the
fear
in
esther
heart
how
the
words
of
the
woman
abigail
appeased
the
king
wrath
the
deed
of
jael
how
judith
went
from
the
city
gate
across
the
plain
as
the
day
grew
late
to
the
tent
of
the
great
assyrian
the
leader
exalted
with
horse
and
man
and
brought
back
his
head
said
tacey
of
course
a
more
difficult
feat
than
to
bring
back
a
horse
in
the
english
camp
the
reveille
drum
told
the
sleeping
troops
that
the
dawn
had
come
and
the
shadows
abroad
that
with
night
were
blent
at
the
drum
tap
startled
crept
under
each
tent
as
tacey
stole
from
the
sheltering
wood
across
the
wet
grass
where
the
horse
pound
stood
hark
was
it
the
twitter
of
frightened
bird
or
was
it
the
challenge
of
sentry
she
heard
she
entered
unseen
but
her
footsteps
she
stayed
when
the
old
gray
horse
in
the
wood
still
neighed
half
hid
in
the
mist
a
shape
loomed
tall
a
steed
that
answered
her
call
with
freedom
beyond
for
the
recompense
she
sprang
to
his
back
and
leaped
the
fence
too
late
the
alarm
but
tacey
heard
as
she
sped
away
how
the
camp
was
stirred
the
stamping
of
horses
the
shouts
of
men
and
the
bugle
impatient
call
again
loudly
and
fast
on
the
ridge
road
beat
the
regular
fall
of
fearnaught
feet
on
his
broad
bare
back
his
rider
seat
was
as
firm
as
the
tread
of
the
steed
so
fleet
small
need
of
saddle
or
bridle
rein
he
answered
as
well
her
touch
on
his
mane
on
down
the
hill
by
the
river
shore
faster
and
faster
she
rode
than
before
her
bonnet
fell
back
her
head
was
bare
and
the
river
breeze
that
freed
her
hair
dispersed
the
fog
and
she
heard
the
shout
of
the
troopers
behind
when
the
sun
came
out
the
wheel
at
van
deering
had
dripped
nearly
dry
in
stillness
the
morning
passed
by
then
the
clatter
of
hoofs
came
down
the
hill
and
the
white
old
miller
ran
out
from
the
mill
but
he
only
saw
through
the
dust
of
the
road
the
last
that
faintly
showed
to
tacey
the
sky
and
the
trees
and
the
wind
seemed
all
to
rush
toward
her
and
follow
behind
her
lips
were
set
firm
and
pale
was
her
cheek
as
she
plunged
down
the
hill
and
through
the
creek
the
tortoise
shell
comb
that
she
lost
that
day
the
wissahickon
carried
away
on
the
other
side
up
the
stony
hill
the
feet
of
fearnaught
went
faster
still
but
somewhat
backward
the
troopers
fell
for
the
hill
and
the
pace
began
to
tell
on
their
horses
worn
with
a
long
campaign
rugged
mountains
and
weary
plain
the
road
was
deserted
for
when
men
fought
a
secret
path
the
traveler
sought
two
scared
idlers
in
levering
inn
fled
to
the
woods
at
the
coming
din
the
watch
dog
ran
to
bark
his
delight
but
pursued
and
pursuers
were
out
of
sight
surely
the
distance
between
them
increased
and
the
shouts
of
the
troopers
had
long
since
ceased
one
after
another
pulled
his
rein
and
rode
with
great
oaths
to
the
camp
again
oft
a
look
backward
tacey
sent
to
the
fading
red
of
the
regiment
she
heard
the
foremost
horseman
call
she
saw
the
horse
stumble
the
rider
fall
she
patted
her
steed
and
checked
his
pace
and
leisurely
rode
the
rest
of
the
race
when
the
sign
on
the
horizon
showed
behind
not
a
trooper
was
on
the
road
in
vain
had
they
shouted
who
followed
in
chase
in
vain
their
wild
ride
so
ended
the
race
though
fifty
strong
voices
may
clamor
and
call
if
she
hear
not
the
strongest
she
hears
not
them
all
though
fifty
fleet
horses
go
galloping
fast
one
swifter
than
all
shall
be
furthest
at
last
said
the
captain
when
he
came
home
the
steed
shall
be
thine
and
a
new
silver
comb
was
a
daring
deed
and
bravely
done
as
proud
of
the
praise
as
the
promise
won
the
maiden
stole
from
the
house
to
feed
with
a
generous
hand
her
gallant
steed
unavailing
the
storms
of
the
century
beat
with
the
roar
of
thunder
or
winter
sleet
the
mansion
still
stands
and
is
heard
as
of
yore
the
wind
in
the
trees
on
the
island
shore
but
the
restless
river
its
shore
line
wears
and
no
longer
the
island
its
old
name
bears
and
years
that
are
gone
in
obscurity
have
enveloped
the
rider
memory
but
in
providence
still
abide
her
race
brave
youths
with
her
spirit
fair
maids
with
her
grace
undaunted
they
stand
when
fainter
hearts
flee
prepared
whatsoever
the
emergency
kit
carson
ride
we
lay
low
in
the
grass
on
the
broad
plain
levels
old
revels
and
i
and
my
stolen
brown
bride
and
the
heavens
of
blue
and
the
harvest
of
brown
and
beautiful
clover
were
welded
as
one
to
the
right
and
the
left
in
the
light
of
the
sun
forty
full
miles
if
a
foot
to
ride
forty
full
miles
if
a
foot
and
the
devils
of
red
camanches
are
hot
on
the
track
when
once
they
strike
it
let
the
sun
go
down
soon
very
soon
muttered
bearded
old
revels
as
he
peered
at
the
sun
lying
low
on
his
back
holding
fast
to
his
lasso
then
he
jerked
at
his
steed
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
glanced
swiftly
around
and
then
dropped
as
if
shot
with
his
ear
to
the
ground
then
again
to
his
feet
and
to
me
to
my
bride
while
his
eyes
were
like
fire
his
face
like
a
shroud
his
form
like
a
king
and
his
beard
like
a
cloud
and
his
voice
loud
and
shrill
as
if
blown
from
a
reed
pull
pull
in
your
lassos
and
bridle
to
steed
and
speed
you
if
ever
for
life
you
would
speed
and
ride
for
your
lives
for
your
lives
you
must
ride
for
the
plain
is
aflame
the
prairie
on
fire
and
feet
of
wild
horses
hard
flying
before
i
hear
like
a
sea
breaking
high
on
the
shore
while
the
buffalo
come
like
a
surge
of
the
sea
driven
far
by
the
flame
driving
fast
on
us
three
as
a
hurricane
comes
crushing
palms
in
his
ire
we
drew
in
the
lassos
seized
saddle
and
rein
threw
them
on
sinched
them
on
sinched
them
over
again
and
again
drew
the
girth
cast
aside
the
macheers
cut
away
tapidaros
loosed
the
sash
from
its
fold
cast
aside
the
catenas
with
gold
and
gold
mounted
colt
the
companions
of
years
cast
the
silken
serapes
to
the
wind
in
a
breath
and
so
bared
to
the
skin
sprang
all
haste
to
the
horse
as
bare
as
when
born
as
when
new
from
the
hand
of
god
without
word
or
one
word
of
command
turned
head
to
the
brazos
in
a
red
race
with
death
turned
head
to
the
brazos
with
a
breath
in
the
hair
blowing
hot
from
a
king
leaving
death
in
his
course
turned
head
to
the
brazos
with
a
sound
in
the
air
like
the
rush
of
an
army
and
a
flash
in
the
eye
of
a
red
wall
of
fire
reaching
up
to
the
sky
stretching
fierce
in
pursuit
of
a
black
rolling
sea
rushing
fast
upon
us
as
the
wind
sweeping
free
and
afar
from
the
desert
blew
hollow
and
hoarse
not
a
word
not
a
wail
from
a
lip
was
let
fall
not
a
kiss
from
my
bride
not
a
look
nor
low
call
of
or
courage
but
on
the
plain
so
steady
and
still
leaning
low
to
the
mane
with
the
heel
to
the
flank
and
the
hand
to
the
rein
rode
we
on
rode
we
three
rode
we
nose
and
gray
nose
reaching
long
breathing
loud
as
a
creviced
wind
blows
yet
we
broke
not
a
whisper
we
breathed
not
a
prayer
there
was
work
to
be
done
there
was
death
in
the
air
and
the
chance
was
as
one
to
a
thousand
for
all
gray
nose
to
gray
nose
and
each
steady
mustang
stretched
neck
and
stretched
nerve
till
the
arid
earth
rang
and
the
foam
from
the
flank
and
the
croup
and
the
neck
flew
around
like
the
spray
on
a
deck
twenty
miles
thirty
miles
a
dim
distant
speck
then
a
long
reaching
line
and
the
brazos
in
sight
and
i
rose
in
my
seat
with
a
shout
of
delight
i
stood
in
my
stirrup
and
looked
to
my
right
but
revels
was
gone
i
glanced
by
my
shoulder
and
saw
his
horse
stagger
i
saw
his
head
drooping
hard
down
on
his
breast
and
his
naked
breast
stooping
low
down
to
the
mane
as
so
swifter
and
bolder
ran
reaching
out
for
us
the
fire
to
right
and
to
left
the
black
buffalo
came
a
terrible
surf
on
a
red
sea
of
flame
rushing
on
in
the
rear
reaching
high
reaching
higher
and
he
rode
neck
to
neck
to
a
buffalo
bull
the
monarch
of
millions
with
shaggy
mane
full
of
smoke
and
of
dust
and
it
shook
with
desire
of
battle
with
rage
and
with
bellowings
loud
and
unearthly
and
up
through
its
lowering
cloud
came
the
flash
of
his
eyes
like
a
fire
while
his
keen
crooked
horns
through
the
storm
of
his
mane
like
black
lances
lifted
and
lifted
again
and
i
looked
but
this
once
for
the
fire
licked
through
and
he
fell
and
was
lost
as
we
rode
two
and
two
i
looked
to
my
left
then
and
nose
neck
and
shoulder
sank
slowly
sank
surely
till
back
to
my
thighs
and
up
through
the
black
blowing
veil
of
her
hair
did
beam
full
in
mine
her
two
marvelous
eyes
with
a
longing
and
love
yet
a
look
of
despair
and
of
pity
for
me
as
she
felt
the
smoke
fold
her
and
flames
reaching
far
for
her
glorious
hair
her
sinking
steed
faltered
his
eager
ears
fell
to
and
fro
and
unsteady
and
all
the
neck
swell
did
subside
and
recede
and
the
nerves
fall
as
dead
then
she
saw
sturdy
paché
still
lorded
his
head
with
a
look
of
delight
for
nor
courage
nor
bribe
nor
naught
but
my
bride
could
have
brought
him
to
me
for
he
was
her
father
and
at
south
santafee
had
once
won
a
whole
herd
sweeping
everything
down
in
a
race
where
the
world
came
to
run
for
the
crown
and
so
when
i
won
the
true
heart
of
my
bride
my
neighbor
and
deadliest
enemy
child
and
child
of
the
kingly
of
his
tribe
she
brought
me
this
steed
to
the
border
the
night
she
met
revels
and
me
in
her
perilous
flight
from
the
lodge
of
the
chief
to
the
north
brazos
side
and
said
so
half
guessing
of
ill
as
she
smiled
as
if
jesting
that
i
and
i
only
should
ride
the
paché
so
if
kin
should
pursue
i
should
surely
escape
without
other
ado
than
to
ride
without
blood
to
the
north
brazos
side
and
await
her
and
wait
till
the
next
hollow
moon
hung
her
horn
in
the
palms
when
surely
and
soon
and
swift
she
would
join
me
and
all
would
be
well
without
bloodshed
or
word
and
now
as
she
fell
from
the
front
and
went
down
in
the
ocean
of
fire
the
last
that
i
saw
was
a
look
of
delight
that
i
should
escape
a
love
a
desire
yet
never
a
word
not
one
look
of
appeal
lest
i
should
reach
hand
should
stay
hand
or
stay
heel
one
instant
for
her
in
my
terrible
flight
then
the
rushing
of
fire
around
me
and
under
and
the
howling
of
beasts
and
a
sound
as
of
thunder
beasts
burning
and
blind
and
forced
onward
and
over
as
the
passionate
flame
reached
around
them
and
wove
her
red
hands
in
their
hair
and
kissed
hot
till
they
died
till
they
died
with
a
wild
and
a
desolate
moan
as
a
sea
on
the
hard
brown
stone
and
into
the
brazos
i
rode
all
alone
all
alone
save
only
a
horse
and
blind
and
bare
and
burnt
to
the
skin
then
just
as
the
terrible
sea
came
in
and
tumbled
its
thousands
hot
into
the
tide
till
the
tide
blocked
up
and
the
swift
stream
brimmed
in
eddies
we
struck
on
the
opposite
side
taming
the
wild
horse
last
night
he
trampled
with
a
thousand
steeds
the
trembling
desert
now
he
stands
alone
his
speed
hath
baffled
theirs
his
fellows
lurk
behind
on
heavy
sands
with
weary
limbs
that
can
not
reach
him
from
the
highest
hill
he
gazes
the
wild
whose
plains
he
spurned
and
his
eye
kindles
and
his
breast
expands
with
an
upheaving
consciousness
of
might
he
stands
an
instant
then
he
breaks
away
as
revelling
in
his
freedom
what
if
art
that
strikes
soul
into
marble
could
but
seize
that
agony
of
action
could
impress
its
muscular
fulness
with
its
winged
haste
upon
the
resisting
rock
while
wonder
stares
and
admiration
worships
there
away
as
glorying
in
that
mighty
wilderness
and
conscious
of
the
gazing
skies
quiver
for
flight
his
sleek
and
slender
limbs
elastic
springing
into
headlong
force
while
his
smooth
neck
curved
loftily
to
arch
dignifies
flight
and
to
his
speed
imparts
the
majesty
not
else
its
attribute
and
circling
now
he
sweeps
the
flowery
plain
as
if
his
imperious
gathering
up
his
limbs
unwearied
by
their
sportive
play
until
he
stands
an
idol
of
the
sight
he
stands
and
trembles
the
warm
life
is
gone
that
gave
him
action
wherefore
is
it
thus
his
eye
hath
lost
its
lustre
though
it
still
sends
forth
a
glance
of
consciousness
and
care
to
a
deep
agony
of
acuteness
wrought
and
straining
at
a
point
a
narrow
point
that
rises
but
a
speck
upon
the
verge
of
the
horizon
sure
the
humblest
life
hath
in
god
providence
some
gracious
guides
that
warn
it
of
its
foe
the
danger
there
his
instinct
teaches
and
with
growing
dread
no
more
solicitous
of
graceful
flight
he
bounds
across
the
plain
he
speeds
away
into
the
tameless
wilderness
afar
to
his
bondage
yet
in
vain
his
flight
vain
his
fleet
limbs
his
desperate
aim
his
leap
through
the
close
thicket
through
the
festering
swamp
and
rushing
waters
his
proud
neck
must
bend
beneath
a
halter
and
the
iron
parts
and
tears
his
delicate
mouth
the
brave
steed
late
bounding
in
his
freedom
consciousness
the
leader
of
the
wild
unreached
of
all
wears
gaudy
trappings
and
becomes
a
slave
he
bears
a
master
on
his
shrinking
back
he
feels
a
rowel
in
his
bleeding
flanks
and
his
arched
neck
beneath
the
biting
thong
burns
while
he
bounds
away
all
desperate
across
the
desert
mad
with
the
vain
hope
to
shake
his
burden
off
he
writhes
he
turns
on
his
oppressor
he
would
rend
the
foe
who
subtle
with
less
strength
had
taken
him
thus
at
foul
advantage
but
he
strives
in
vain
a
sudden
pang
a
newer
form
of
pain
baffles
and
bears
him
on
he
feels
his
fate
and
with
a
shriek
of
agony
which
tells
loudly
the
terrors
of
his
new
estate
he
makes
the
desert
his
own
desert
ring
with
the
wild
clamors
of
his
new
born
grief
one
fruitless
effort
more
one
desperate
bound
for
the
old
freedom
of
his
natural
life
and
then
he
humbles
to
his
cruel
lot
submits
and
finds
his
conqueror
in

in
low
water
well

ai
six
weeks

jedge

his
nevey
struck
for
that
ford
in
the
night
in
the
rain
and
the
water
all
round
us
up
to
our
flanks
in
the
gulch
and
rattlesnake
creek
just
a
bilin
not
a
plank
left
in
the
dam
and
nary
a
bridge
on
the
river
i
had
the
grey
and
the
jedge
had
his
roan
and

and
after
us
trundled
the
rocks
jest
loosed
from
the
top
of
the
cañon
lickity
lickity
switch
we
came
to
the
ford
and
chiquita
buckled
right
down
to
her
work
and
afore
i
could
yell
to
her
rider
took
water
jest
at
the
ford
and
there
was
the
jedge
and
me
standing
and
twelve
hundred
dollars
of
afloat
and
a
driftin
to
thunder
would
ye
it
that
night
that
hoss
that
ar
filly
chiquita
walked
herself
into
her
stall
and
stood
there
all
quiet
and
dripping
clean
as
a
beaver
or
rat
with
nary
a
buckle
of
harness
just
as
she
swam
the
fork
that
hoss
that
ar
filly
chiquita

what
i
call
a
hoss
and
what
did
you
say
oh
the
nevey

he
never
kem
back
to
deny
it
ye
see
the
derned
fool
had
no
seat
ye
could
have
made
him
a
rider
and
then
ye
know
boys
will
be
boys
and
hosses
well
hosses
is
hosses
bay
billy
was
the
last
fight
at
fredericksburg
perhaps
the
day
you
reck
our
boys
the
maine
kept
early
men
in
check
just
where
wade
hampton
boomed
away
the
fight
went
neck
and
neck
all
day
the
weaker
wing
we
held
and
held
it
with
a
will
five
several
stubborn
times
we
charged
the
battery
on
the
hill
and
five
times
beaten
back
and
kept
our
column
still
at
last
from
out
the
centre
fight
spurred
up
a
general
aid
that
battery
must
silenced
be
he
cried
as
past
he
sped
our
colonel
simply
touched
his
cap
and
then
with
measured
tread
to
lead
the
crouching
line
once
more
the
grand
old
fellow
came
no
wounded
man
but
raised
his
head
and
strove
to
gasp
his
name
and
those
who
could
not
speak
nor
stir
god
blessed
him
just
the
same
for
he
was
all
the
world
to
us
that
hero
gray
and
grim
right
well
he
knew
that
fearful
slope
we
climb
with
none
but
him
though
while
his
white
head
led
the
way
we
charge
hell
portals
in
this
time
we
were
not
up
when
midst
the
storm
of
shell
our
leader
with
his
sword
upraised
beneath
our
bayonets
fell
and
as
we
bore
him
back
the
foe
set
up
a
joyous
yell
our
hearts
went
with
him
back
we
swept
and
when
the
bugle
said
up
charge
again
no
man
was
there
but
hung
his
dogged
head
we
no
one
left
to
lead
us
now
the
sullen
soldiers
said
just
then
before
the
laggard
line
the
colonel
horse
we
spied
bay
billy
with
his
trappings
on
his
nostrils
swelling
wide
as
though
still
on
his
gallant
back
the
master
sat
astride
right
royally
he
took
the
place
that
was
of
old
his
wont
and
with
a
neigh
that
seemed
to
say
above
the
battle
brunt
how
can
the
charge
if
i
am
not
in
front
like
statues
rooted
there
we
stood
and
gazed
a
little
space
above
that
floating
mane
we
missed
the
dear
familiar
face
but
we
saw
bay
billy
eye
of
fire
and
it
gave
us
heart
of
grace
no
could
rouse
us
all
as
that
brave
sight
had
done
down
all
the
battered
line
we
felt
a
lightning
impulse
run
up
up
the
hill
we
followed
bill
and
we
captured
every
gun
and
when
upon
the
conquered
height
died
out
the
battle
hum
vainly
mid
living
and
the
dead
we
sought
our
leader
dumb
it
seemed
as
if
a
spectre
steed
to
win
that
day
had
come
and
then
the
dusk
and
dew
of
night
fell
softly
the
plain
as
though
man
dread
work
of
death
the
angels
wept
again
and
drew
night
curtain
gently
round
a
thousand
beds
of
pain
all
night
the
surgeons
torches
went
the
ghastly
rows
all
night
with
solemn
step
i
paced
the
torn
and
bloody
green
but
who
that
fought
in
the
big
war
such
dread
sights
have
not
seen
at
last
the
morning
broke
the
lark
sang
in
the
merry
skies
as
if
to
the
sleepers
there
it
bade
awake
and
rise
though
naught
but
that
last
trump
of
all
could
ope
their
heavy
eyes
and
then
once
more
with
banners
gay
stretched
out
the
long
brigade
trimly
upon
the
furrowed
field
the
troops
stood
on
parade
and
bravely
mid
the
ranks
were
closed
the
gaps
the
fight
had
made
not
half
the
men
were
in
their
place
that
morn
and
corporal
dick
who
stood
six
brave
fellows
on
now
touched
my
elbow
in
the
ranks
for
all
between
were
gone
ah
who
forgets
that
dreary
hour
when
as
with
misty
eyes
to
call
the
old
familiar
roll
the
solemn
sergeant
tries
one
feels
that
thumping
of
the
heart
as
no
prompt
voice
replies
and
as
in
faltering
tone
and
slow
the
last
few
names
were
said
across
the
field
some
missing
horse
toiled
up
with
weary
tread
it
caught
the
sergeant
eye
and
quick
bay
billy
name
he
read
yes
there
the
old
bay
hero
stood
all
safe
from
battle
harms
and
ere
an
order
could
be
heard
or
the
bugle
quick
alarms
down
all
the
front
from
end
to
end
the
troops
presented
arms
not
all
the
on
earth
could
still
our
mighty
cheer
and
ever
from
that
famous
day
when
rang
the
clear
bay
billy
name
was
read
and
then
the
whole
line
answered
here
widderin
race
a
horse
amongst
ten
thousand
on
the
verge
the
extremest
verge
of
equine
life
he
stands
yet
mark
his
action
as
those
wild
young
colts
freed
from
the
gallop
whinnying
up
see
how
he
trots
towards
them
nose
in
air
tail
arched
and
his
still
sinewy
legs
in
gallant
grace
before
him
a
brave
beast
as
ever
spurned
the
moorland
ay
and
more
he
bore
me
once
such
words
but
smite
the
truth
i
the
outer
ring
while
vivid
memory
wakes
recalling
now
the
passion
and
the
pain
he
bore
me
once
from
earthly
hell
to
heaven
the
sight
of
fine
old
widderin
that
his
name
caught
from
a
peak
the
topmost
rugged
peak
of
tall
mount
widderin
towering
to
the
north
most
like
a
steed
head
with
full
nostrils
blown
and
ears
pricked
up
the
sight
of
widderin
brings
that
day
of
days
before
me
whose
strange
hours
of
fear
and
anguish
ere
the
sunset
changed
to
hours
of
such
content
and
joy
as
heaven
can
give
our
mortal
lives
but
once
well
here
the
story
while
yon
sweep
the
distant
ranges
and
the
river
voice
pipes
a
thin
treble
through
the
heart
of
drouth
while
the
red
heaven
like
some
hugh
caldron
top
seems
with
the
heat
better
far
in
place
of
riding
tilt
such
a
sun
here
in
the
safe
veranda
flowery
gloom
to
play
the
dwarfish
homer
to
a
song
whereof
myself
am
hero
two
decades
have
passed
since
that
wild
when
last
the
convict
hordes
from
near
van
diemen
freed
by
force
or
fraud
swept
like
a
fire
inland
from
beach
to
mountain
bent
on
raid
and
rapine
so
in
late
autumn
was
a
marvellous
morn
with
breezes
from
the
calm
borne
that
touched
the
air
and
stirred
it
into
thrills
mysterious
and
mesmeric
a
bright
mist
lapping
the
landscape
like
a
golden
trance
swathing
the
with
fantastic
veils
and
the
quivering
light
as
gossamer
threads
drawn
down
the
forest
aisles
at
dewy
dawning
on
this
marvellous
morn
i
with
four
comrades
in
this
selfsame
spot
watched
the
fair
scene
and
drank
the
spicy
airs
that
held
a
subtler
spirit
than
our
wine
and
talked
and
laughed
and
mused
in
idleness
weaving
vague
fancies
as
our
curled
fantastic
in
the
sunlight
i
with
head
thrown
back
and
cushioned
snugly
and
with
eyes
intent
on
one
grotesque
and
curious
cloud
puffed
upward
that
now
seemed
to
take
the
shape
of
a
dutch
tulip
now
a
turk
face
topped
by
folds
on
folds
of
turban
limitless
heard
suddenly
just
as
the
clock
chimed
one
to
melt
in
musical
echoes
up
the
hills
quick
footsteps
on
the
gravelled
path
without
steps
of
the
couriers
of
calamity
so
my
heart
told
me
ere
with
blanched
regards
two
stalwart
herdsmen
on
our
threshold
paused
panting
with
lips
that
writhed
and
awful
eyes
a
breath
space
in
each
other
eyes
we
glared
then
swift
as
interchange
of
lightning
thrusts
in
deadly
combat
question
and
reply
clashed
sharply
what
the
rangers
ay
by
heaven
and
loosed
in
force
the
whither
bound
i
stammered
hoarsely
bound
the
elder
said
southward
four
stations
had
they
sacked
and
burnt
and
now
drunk
furious
but
i
stopped
to
hear
no
more
with
booming
thunder
in
mine
ears
and
eyes
i
rushed
to
widderin
side
drew
tight
the
girths
upgathered
curb
and
rein
and
sprang
to
horse
ere
yet
our
laggard
friends
now
trooping
from
the
green
veranda
shade
could
dream
of
action
love
had
winged
my
will
for
to
the
southward
fair
garoopna
held
my
all
of
hope
life
passion
she
whose
hair
its
tiniest
strand
of
waving
gold
had
caught
my
heart
entwined
and
bound
it
fast
as
some
sweet
enchantment
heavenly
net
i
only
gave
a
in
farewell
shot
by
and
the
endless
moorland
swept
endless
it
seemed
as
those
weird
measureless
plains
which
in
some
nightmare
vision
stretch
and
stretch
towards
infinity
like
some
lone
ship
wastes
of
sailless
waters
now
a
pine
the
beacon
pine
gigantic
whose
grim
crown
signals
the
far
from
out
gaunt
boulders
of
the
organ
hill
rose
on
my
sight
a
wavering
orb
the
while
still
onward
onward
onward
still
with
motion
winged
elastic
equable
brave
widderin
cleaved
the
tossed
aside
the
winds
as
waves
their
swift
invisible
breasts
hissing
with
noise
when
pressed
and
pierced
by
that
keen
head
and
form
the
lonely
shepherd
guardian
on
the
plains
watching
his
sheep
through
languid
eyes
looked
up
and
marvelled
as
we
passed
him
by
thinking
perchance
it
was
a
glorious
thing
so
dressed
so
booted
so
caparisoned
to
ride
such
bright
unto
death
two
natives
slumbering
in
the
grass
just
rose
betimes
to
the
trampling
hoofs
and
hurled
hot
curses
at
me
as
i
sped
while
here
and
there
the
timid
kangaroo
blundered
athwart
the
and
in
puffs
of
steamy
vanished
like
a
mote
onward
still
onward
onward
onward
still
and
lo
thank
heaven
the
mighty
organ
hill
that
seemed
a
dim
blue
cloudlet
at
the
start
hangs
in
aerial
fluted
cliffs
aloft
and
still
as
through
the
long
low
glacis
borne
beneath
the
gorge
borne
ever
at
wild
speed
i
saw
the
mateless
mountain
eagle
wheel
beyond
the
stark
height
topmost
pinnacle
i
heard
his
shriek
of
rage
and
ravin
die
deep
down
the
desolate
dells
as
far
behind
i
left
the
gorge
and
far
before
me
swept
another
plain
now
and
bound
by
the
clear
river
gurgling
its
bed
by
this
my
panting
but
unconquered
steed
had
thrown
his
small
head
backward
and
his
breath
through
the
red
nostrils
burst
in
labored
sighs
i
bent
above
his
outstretched
neck
i
threw
my
quivering
arms
about
him
murmuring
low
good
horse
brave
heart
a
little
longer
bear
the
strain
the
travail
and
thenceforth
for
thee
free
pastures
all
thy
days
till
death
shall
come
ah
many
and
many
a
time
my
noble
bay
her
lily
hand
hath
wandered
through
thy
mane
patted
thy
rainbow
neck
and
brought
thee
ears
of
daintiest
corn
from
out
the
farmhouse
loft
help
help
to
save
her
now
i
vow
the
brute
heard
me
and
comprehended
what
he
heard
he
shook
his
proud
crest
madly
and
his
eye
turned
for
a
moment
sideways
flashed
in
mine
a
lightning
gleam
whose
fiery
language
said
i
know
my
lineage
will
not
shame
my
sire
my
sire
who
rushed
triumphant
the
flags
and
frenzied
thousands
when
on
epsom
downs
arcturus
won
the
derby
no
nor
shame
my
granddam
whose
clean
body
half
enwrought
of
air
half
fire
through
swirls
of
desert
sand
bore
sheik
abdallah
headlong
on
his
prey
at
last
came
forest
shadows
and
the
road
winding
through
bush
and
bracken
and
at
last
the
hoarse
stream
rumbling
its
crags
no
no
stanch
widderin
pause
not
now
to
drink
an
hour
hence
and
thy
dainty
nose
shall
dip
in
richest
wine
poured
jubilantly
forth
to
quench
thy
thirst
my
beauty
but
press
on
nor
heed
these
sparkling
waters
god
my
on
fire
once
more
an
instant
tells
me
all
all
life
or
death
salvation
or
despair
for
yonder
the
wild
slope
the
house
stands
or
it
stood
but
yesterday
a
titan
cry
of
inarticulate
joy
i
raised
as
calm
and
peaceful
in
the
sun
shone
the
fair
cottage
and
the
wherein
unconscious
sat
my
love
lilting
a
low
song
to
the
birds
and
flowers
she
heard
the
saw
me
started
up
and
with
her
blue
eyes
wider
than
their
wont
and
rosy
lips
half
tremulous
rushed
to
meet
and
greet
me
swiftly
up
dear
love
i
cried
the
convicts
the
let
us
fly
ah
then
and
there
you
should
have
seen
her
friend
my
noble
beauteous
helen
not
a
tear
nor
sob
and
scarce
a
transient
as
clasping
hand
in
hand
her
fairy
foot
lit
like
a
small
bird
on
my
horseman
boot
and
up
into
the
saddle
lithe
and
light
vaulting
she
perched
her
bright
curls
round
my
face
we
crossed
the
river
and
dismounting
led
the
steep
slope
of
blended
rock
and
turf
the
wearied
horse
and
there
behind
a
tor
of
castellated
bluestone
paused
to
sweep
with
young
keen
eyes
the
broad
plain
stretched
afar
serene
and
at
our
feet
either
said
i
these
devils
have
gone
east
to
meet
with
bloodhound
desborough
in
his
rage
between
the
granite
passes
of
luxorme
or
else
dear
christ
my
helen
low
stoop
low
these
words
were
hissed
in
horror
for
just
then
the
deep
hollows
of
the
the
miscreants
with
mixed
shouts
and
curses
poured
down
through
the
flinty
gorge
tumultuously
seeming
we
thought
in
one
fierce
throng
to
charge
our
i
seized
my
widderin
head
blindfolding
him
for
with
a
single
neigh
our
fate
were
sealed
o
the
instant
as
they
rode
those
wild
demons
by
our
lair
scarce
twelve
yards
off
my
troubled
steed
shook
wide
his
streaming
mane
stamped
on
the
earth
and
pawed
so
loudly
that
the
sweat
of
agony
rolled
down
my
cold
forehead
at
which
point
i
felt
my
arm
clutched
and
a
voice
i
did
not
know
dropped
the
low
murmur
from
pale
shuddering
lips
o
god
if
in
those
brutal
hands
i
fall
living
look
not
into
your
mother
face
or
any
woman
more
what
time
had
passed
above
our
bowed
heads
we
pent
pinioned
there
by
awe
and
nameless
horror
who
shall
tell
minutes
perchance
by
mortal
measurement
eternity
by
when
at
length
we
turned
and
eyes
of
mutual
wonder
raised
we
gazed
on
alien
faces
haggard
worn
and
strange
of
feature
as
the
faces
born
in
fever
and
delirium
were
we
saved
we
scarce
could
comprehend
it
till
from
out
the
neighboring
rode
our
friends
at
speed
with
clang
of
steel
and
eyebrows
bent
in
wrath
but
warned
betimes
the
wily
ruffians
fled
far
up
the
and
beyond
the
dazzling
of
the
distant
hills
their
yells
of
fiendish
laughter
pealing
faint
and
fainter
from
the
cloudland
and
the
mist
that
closed
about
them
like
an
shroud
yet
were
these
wretches
marked
for
imminent
death
the
next
keen
sunrise
pierced
the
savage
gorge
to
which
we
tracked
them
where
mere
beasts
at
bay
grimly
they
fought
and
brute
by
brute
they
fell
hamilton
the
diverting
history
of
john
gilpin
showing
how
he
went
farther
than
he
intended
and
came
safe
home
again
john
gilpin
was
a
citizen
of
credit
and
renown
a
trainband
captain
eke
was
he
of
famous
london
town
john
gilpin
spouse
said
to
her
dear
though
wedded
we
have
been
these
twice
ten
tedious
years
yet
we
no
holiday
have
seen
to
morrow
is
our
and
we
will
then
repair
unto
the
bell
at
edmonton
all
in
a
chaise
and
pair
my
sister
and
my
sister
child
myself
and
children
three
will
fill
the
chaise
so
you
must
ride
on
horseback
after
we
he
soon
replied
i
do
admire
of
womankind
but
one
and
you
are
she
my
dearest
dear
therefore
it
shall
be
done
i
am
a
linendraper
bold
as
all
the
world
doth
know
and
my
good
friend
the
calender
will
lend
his
horse
to
go
quoth
gilpin
that
well
said
and
for
that
wine
is
dear
we
will
be
furnished
with
our
own
which
is
both
bright
and
clear
john
gilpin
kissed
his
loving
wife
was
he
to
find
that
though
on
pleasure
she
was
bent
she
had
a
frugal
mind
the
morning
came
the
chaise
was
brought
but
yet
was
not
allowed
to
drive
up
to
the
door
lest
all
should
say
that
she
was
proud
so
three
doors
off
the
chaise
was
stayed
where
they
did
all
get
in
six
precious
souls
and
all
agog
to
dash
through
thick
and
thin
smack
went
the
whip
round
went
the
wheels
were
never
folks
so
glad
the
stones
did
rattle
underneath
as
if
cheapside
were
mad
john
gilpin
at
his
horse
side
seized
fast
the
flowing
mane
and
up
he
got
in
haste
to
ride
but
soon
came
down
again
for
scarce
reached
had
he
his
journey
to
begin
when
turning
round
his
head
he
saw
three
customers
come
in
so
down
he
came
for
loss
of
time
although
it
grieved
him
sore
yet
loss
of
pence
full
well
he
knew
would
trouble
him
much
more
was
long
before
the
customers
were
suited
to
their
mind
when
betty
screaming
came
down
stairs
the
wine
is
left
behind
good
lack
quoth
he
yet
bring
it
me
my
leathern
belt
likewise
in
which
i
bear
my
trusty
sword
when
i
do
exercise
now
mistress
gilpin
careful
soul
had
two
stone
bottles
found
to
hold
the
liquor
that
she
loved
and
keep
it
safe
and
sound
each
bottle
had
a
curling
ear
through
which
the
belt
he
drew
and
hung
a
bottle
on
each
side
to
make
his
balance
true
then
over
all
that
he
might
be
equipped
from
top
to
toe
his
cloak
well
brushed
and
neat
he
manfully
did
throw
now
see
him
mounted
once
again
upon
his
nimble
steed
full
slowly
pacing
the
stones
with
caution
and
good
heed
but
finding
soon
a
smoother
road
beneath
his
feet
the
snorting
beast
began
to
trot
which
galled
him
in
his
seat
so
fair
and
softly
john
he
cried
but
john
he
cried
in
vain
that
trot
became
a
gallop
soon
in
spite
of
curb
and
rein
so
stooping
down
as
needs
he
must
who
can
not
sit
upright
he
grasped
the
mane
with
both
his
hands
and
eke
with
all
his
might
his
horse
who
never
in
that
sort
had
handled
been
before
what
thing
upon
his
back
had
got
did
wonder
more
and
more
away
went
gilpin
neck
or
naught
away
went
hat
and
wig
he
little
dreamt
when
he
set
out
of
running
such
a
rig
the
wind
did
blow
the
cloak
did
fly
like
streamer
long
and
gay
till
loop
and
button
failing
both
at
last
it
flew
away
then
might
all
people
well
discern
the
bottles
he
had
slung
a
bottle
swinging
at
each
side
as
hath
been
said
or
sung
the
dogs
did
bark
the
children
screamed
up
flew
the
windows
all
and
every
soul
cried
out
well
done
as
loud
as
he
could
bawl
away
went
gilpin
who
but
he
his
fame
soon
spread
around
he
carries
weight
he
rides
a
race
is
for
a
thousand
pound
and
still
as
fast
as
he
drew
near
was
wonderful
to
view
how
in
a
trice
the
turnpike
men
their
gates
wide
open
threw
and
now
as
he
went
bowing
down
his
reeking
head
fell
low
the
bottles
twain
behind
his
back
were
shattered
at
a
blow
down
ran
the
wine
into
the
road
most
piteous
to
be
seen
which
made
his
horse
flanks
to
smoke
as
they
had
basted
been
but
still
he
seemed
to
carry
weight
with
leathern
girdle
braced
for
all
might
see
the
bottle
necks
still
dangling
at
his
waist
thus
all
through
merry
islington
these
gambols
did
he
play
until
he
came
unto
the
wash
of
edmonton
so
gay
and
there
he
threw
the
wash
about
on
both
sides
of
the
way
just
like
unto
a
trundling
mop
or
a
wild
goose
at
play
at
edmonton
his
loving
wife
from
the
balcony
spied
her
tender
husband
wondering
much
to
see
how
he
did
ride
stop
stop
john
gilpin
here
the
house
they
all
at
once
did
cry
the
dinner
waits
and
we
are
tired
said
gilpin
so
am
i
but
yet
his
horse
was
not
a
whit
inclined
to
tarry
there
for
why
his
owner
had
a
house
full
ten
miles
off
at
ware
so
like
an
arrow
swift
he
flew
shot
by
an
archer
strong
so
did
he
fly
which
brings
me
to
the
middle
of
my
song
away
went
gilpin
out
of
breath
and
sore
against
his
will
till
at
his
friend
the
his
horse
at
last
stood
still
the
calender
amazed
to
see
his
neighbor
in
such
trim
laid
down
his
pipe
flew
to
the
gate
and
thus
accosted
him
what
news
what
news
your
tidings
tell
tell
me
you
must
and
say
why
bareheaded
you
are
come
or
why
you
come
at
all
now
gilpin
had
a
pleasant
wit
and
loved
a
timely
joke
and
thus
unto
the
calender
in
merry
guise
he
spoke
i
came
because
your
horse
would
come
and
if
i
well
forbode
my
hat
and
wig
will
soon
be
here
they
are
upon
the
road
the
calender
right
glad
to
find
his
friend
in
merry
pin
returned
him
not
a
single
word
but
to
the
house
went
in
whence
straight
he
came
with
hat
and
wig
a
wig
that
flowed
behind
a
hat
not
much
the
worse
for
wear
each
comely
in
its
kind
he
held
them
up
and
in
his
turn
thus
showed
his
ready
wit
my
head
is
twice
as
big
as
yours
they
therefore
needs
must
fit
but
let
me
scrape
the
dirt
away
that
hangs
upon
your
face
and
stop
and
eat
for
well
you
may
be
in
a
hungry
case
said
john
it
is
my
and
all
the
world
would
stare
if
wife
should
dine
at
edmonton
and
i
should
dine
at
ware
so
turning
to
his
horse
he
said
i
am
in
haste
to
dine
was
for
your
pleasure
you
came
here
you
shall
go
back
for
mine
ah
luckless
speech
and
bootless
boast
for
which
he
paid
full
dear
for
while
he
spake
a
braying
ass
did
sing
most
loud
and
clear
whereat
his
horse
did
snort
as
he
had
heard
a
lion
roar
and
galloped
off
with
all
his
might
as
he
had
done
before
away
went
gilpin
and
away
went
gilpin
hat
and
wig
he
lost
them
sooner
than
at
first
for
why
they
were
too
big
now
mistress
gilpin
when
she
saw
her
husband
posting
down
into
the
country
far
away
she
pulled
out
half
a
crown
and
thus
unto
the
youth
she
said
that
drove
them
to
the
bell
this
shall
be
yours
when
you
bring
back
my
husband
safe
and
well
the
youth
did
ride
and
soon
did
meet
john
coming
back
amain
whom
in
a
trice
he
tried
to
stop
by
catching
at
his
rein
but
not
performing
what
he
meant
and
gladly
would
have
done
the
frighted
steed
he
frighted
more
and
made
him
faster
run
away
went
gilpin
and
away
went
postboy
at
his
heels
the
postboy
horse
right
glad
to
miss
the
lumbering
of
the
wheels
six
gentlemen
upon
the
road
thus
seeing
gilpin
fly
with
postboy
scampering
in
the
rear
they
raised
the
hue
and
cry
stop
thief
stop
thief
a
highwayman
not
one
of
them
was
mute
and
all
and
each
that
passed
that
way
did
join
in
the
pursuit
and
now
the
again
flew
open
in
short
space
the
thinking
as
before
that
gilpin
rode
a
race
and
so
he
did
and
won
it
too
for
he
got
first
to
town
nor
stopped
till
where
he
had
got
up
he
did
again
get
down
now
let
us
sing
long
live
the
king
and
gilpin
long
live
he
and
when
he
next
doth
ride
abroad
may
i
be
there
to
see
reflections
of
a
proud
pedestrian
i
saw
the
curl
of
his
waving
lash
and
the
glance
of
his
knowing
eye
and
i
knew
that
he
thought
he
was
cutting
a
dash
as
his
steed
went
thundering
by
and
he
may
ride
in
the
rattling
gig
or
flourish
the
stanhope
gay
and
dream
that
he
looks
exceeding
big
to
the
people
that
walk
in
the
way
but
he
shall
think
when
the
night
is
still
on
the
gathering
numbers
and
the
ghost
of
many
a
veteran
bill
shall
hover
around
his
slumbers
the
ghastly
dun
shall
worry
his
sleep
and
constables
cluster
around
him
and
he
shall
creep
from
the
deep
where
their
spectre
eyes
have
found
him
ay
gather
your
reins
and
crack
your
thong
and
bid
your
steed
go
faster
he
does
not
know
as
he
scrambles
along
that
he
has
a
fool
for
his
master
and
hurry
away
on
your
lonely
ride
nor
deign
from
the
mire
to
save
me
i
will
paddle
it
stoutly
at
your
side
with
the
tandem
that
nature
gave
me
