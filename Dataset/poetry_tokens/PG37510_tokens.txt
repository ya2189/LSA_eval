introduction
a
number
of
the
songs
in
this
collection
have
been
heard
by
campfire
and
trail
from
the
camps
of
british
columbia
to
the
lumber
camps
of
maine
several
of
the
songs
have
been
fired
at
the
huns
somewhere
in
france
no
doubt
with
deadly
effect
and
also
at
the
turks
on
the
long
long
hike
to
bagdad
and
beyond
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
some
of
my
countrymen
are
now
warbling
snatches
of
my
humble
verse
to
the
accompaniment
of
bagpipes
on
the
streets
of
the
new
jerusalem
many
of
the
verses
have
appeared
from
time
to
time
in
leading
publications
from
vancouver
to
the
new
england
states
and
eastern
canada
while
others
appear
in
print
here
for
the
first
time
from
all
parts
of
the
land
i
have
received
letters
at
various
times
asking
for
extra
copies
of
some
particular
song
in
my
humble
collection
which
i
was
not
in
a
position
to
supply
at
the
time
i
therefore
decided
to
publish
some
of
the
songs
for
which
a
demand
had
been
expressed
and
in
so
doing
offer
to
the
reading
public
in
extenuation
of
my
offense
the
plea
that
in
a
manner
this
humble
volume
is
being
published
by
request
i
offer
no
apology
for
my
dialect
songs
as
they
have
already
received
the
approval
of
music
lovers
whose
judgment
is
beyond
criticism
for
the
errors
which
must
inevitably
creep
into
the
work
of
a
lumberjack
i
crave
the
indulgence
of
all
highbrows
who
may
resent
my
inability
to
comb
the
classics
for
copy
to
please
them
all
the
merit
i
can
claim
is
the
ability
to
rhyme
a
limerick
or
sing
a
in
a
manner
perhaps
not
unpleasing
to
my
friends
the
lumberjacks
will
understand
me
i
am
sure
and
will
appreciate
my
humble
efforts
to
entertain
them
as
for
the
genial
highbrow
should
he
deem
me
an
interloper
in
the
realm
of
letters
and
imagine
that
my
wild
uncultured
notes
are
destroying
the
harmony
of
his
supersensitive
soul
i
shall
lope
back
to
the
tall
timber
again
and
seek
sympathy
and
appreciation
among
the
lumberjacks
of
the
forest
primeval
where
amid
the
wild
surroundings
and
the
crooning
of
the
trees
there
is
health
for
mind
and
body
borne
on
every
passing
breeze
yes
there
something
strangely
healing
in
the
magic
of
the
myrrh
in
the
odor
of
the
cedar
and
the
fragrance
of
the
fir
there
the
hardy
lumberjack
is
the
undisputed
lord
of
the
lowlands
and
chief
of
the
highlands
and
at
the
present
time
no
soldier
in
the
trenches
or
sailor
on
the
rolling
deep
has
a
more
arduous
task
to
perform
or
a
more
important
duty
to
discharge
than
he
toil
on
ye
titans
of
the
tall
timbers
steadfast
soldiers
of
the
saw
and
able
allies
of
the
axe
carry
on
till
the
stately
trees
which
constitute
the
glory
of
the
west
are
converted
into
ships
and
planes
in
countless
thousands
to
win
the
great
war
for
freedom
and
to
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy

de

is
in
an
we
have
scotch
call
dram
the
cleveland
message
the
seeming
hostile
spirit
towards
the
united
states
pervading
some
of
the
sketches
in
this
volume
is
more
apparent
than
real
as
they
were
introduced
in
the
spirit
of
fun
to
accentuate
the
oddities
of
certain
characters
and
not
to
disparage
our
neighbor
for
notwithstanding
petty
quarrels
and
misunderstandings
we
always
loved
our
great
big
bluff
brother
to
the
south
we
always
maintained
that
closer
relationship
with
our
kindred
people
was
our
manifest
destiny
and
that
nothing
could
happen
that
would
keep
us
permanently
apart
according
to
this
song
written
many
years
ago
we
have
been
interwooing
and
intermarrying
for
a
long
time
we
have
been
flocking
to
their
cities
and
they
have
been
flocking
to
our
farms
and
naturally
the
ties
between
us
have
been
growing
stronger
with
the
years
consequently
when
the
present
great
war
engulfed
the
world
in
a
holocaust
of
blood
kindred
cried
to
kindred
and
the
resulting
alliance
was
both
natural
and
logical
time
alone
can
prove
the
value
of
the
services
rendered
the
allied
cause
in
this
great
war
by
british
americans
and
americanadians
residing
in
the
united
states
the
germans
and
of
this
country
thot
in
their
overweening
pride
with
overbearing
kultur
to
obtain
a
greater
pull
with
uncle
sam
than
we
possessed
by
the
most
cunning
propaganda
ever
known
they
endeavored
to
widen
the
breach
between
brother
jonathan
and
john
bull
but
failed
miserably
while
they
hoched
for
the
fatherland
till
the
cows
came
home
we
coached
for
the
motherland
till
the
children
came
home
kultur
may
be
a
powerful
persuader
but
the
call
of
the
blood
is
more
powerful
still
and
when
the
old
lion
roared
his
appeal
the
sound
went
round
the
world
and
the
whelps
true
to
their
breed
gathered
from
all
corners
of
the
earth
not
into
alien
jungles
but
home
the
fur
is
now
flying
and
blood
is
flowing
and
when
the
combatants
shall
have
emerged
from
the
great
conflict
the
two
powerful
branches
of
the
peoples
will
be
bound
together
in
ties
of
friendship
stronger
than
ever
before
and
by
thunder
they
will
not
be
under
the
cleveland
message
or
how
canada
and
the
may
become
one
it
is
such
a
fad
at
present
for
each
poet
effervescent
to
assail
the
cross
or
crescent
and
the
cleveland
message
grim
that
we
pondered
for
a
minute
thinking
we
would
not
be
in
it
if
we
did
not
aid
some
linnet
with
a
little
of
our
din
now
we
not
unwilling
to
receive
a
course
of
drilling
if
successful
in
dispelling
just
a
little
of
the
mist
which
is
hanging
thickly
over
our
detractor
brother
grover
and
that
rank
sedition
mover
called
the
jingo
journalist
there
are
men
among
you
moving
who
ostensibly
peace
loving
while
their
conduct
always
proving
the
reverse
to
be
their
toast
they
eternally
are
blowing
like
a
game
cock
bent
on
showing
by
his
loud
defiant
crowing
that
he
there
to
rule
the
roost
tho
you
send
a
warlike
message
do
not
punctuate
its
passage
crying
cut
into
sassage
now
beware
you
crippled
cuss
all
such
ravings
out
of
season
should
be
classified
as
treason
guard
your
tongues
and
use
your
reason
in
considering
the
fuss
if
again
your
mind
should
rove
around
the
field
of
carnage
grover
we
would
have
you
think
it
over
in
the
light
of
common
sense
ponder
well
the
pain
and
labor
it
would
cause
to
quell
your
neighbor
and
be
sure
you
hide
your
saber
you
venture
through
our
fence
why
rely
on
jingo
blowing
if
you
bent
upon
subduing
brave
canadians
who
been
growing
since
they
met
montgomery
drop
your
systematic
hounding
and
your
epithets
loud
sounding
for
we
pipers
here
abounding
who
could
blow
you
out
to
sea
if
you
saw
bold
piper
ronald
of
the
warlike
clan
macdonald
and
the
way
in
which
he
pommelled
a
hundred
of
your
ranks
you
would
soon
be
after
wishing
you
had
always
kept
right
at
home
instead
of
swishing
warlines
over
britain
banks
and
it
seems
to
us
so
very
queer
that
highlanders
who
quarry
monumental
stones
at
barre
did
not
scare
away
your
frowns
had
they
started
with
their
hammers
down
among
your
city
bummers
it
would
take
you
many
summers
to
repopulate
your
towns
yea
at
prospects
of
a
battle
from
old
bangor
to
seattle
each
canadian
would
skedaddle
to
defend
his
home
and
kin
and
from
picton
to
vancouver
we
would
welcome
each
one
over
thus
united
brother
grover
would
you
have
a
chance
to
win
then
relinquish
yankee
dodges
we
would
warn
you
to
be
cautious
silence
rabid
cabot
lodges
and
your
jingo
journalists
friendship
thread
already
slender
needs
a
sapient
defender
as
the
lion
tail
is
tender
from
so
many
ruthless
twists
we
have
often
heard
it
stated
when
by
jingoists
berated
that
the
people
here
were
fated
to
be
taken
in
by
sam
but
believe
us
brother
grover
coming
ages
will
discover
that
you
can
not
get
us
over
in
that
manner
by
a
d
there
another
way
that
better
than
coercion
and
the
fetter
and
we
tell
you
in
this
letter
how
to
circumvent
the
end
cultivate
a
better
feeling
for
your
neighbor
in
your
dealing
as
you
never
see
us
kneeling
for
the
favors
you
can
lend
let
events
their
course
pursuing
glide
along
as
they
been
doing
let
our
people
interwooing
intermarry
buy
and
sell
let
your
friendly
salutation
be
extended
to
this
nation
let
the
law
of
gravitation
do
the
rest
and
all
is
well
you
have
often
sold
a
daughter
to
some
dude
across
the
water
while
the
title
high
which
bought
her
you
so
seemingly
ignore
why
not
send
us
a
cotillion
of
those
girls
who
own
a
million
for
our
hardy
northern
gillian
on
the
old
canadian
shore
you
may
think
this
would
not
do
but
we
can
tell
you
that
your
blue
blood
is
in
it
with
the
true
blood
of
our
bracing
northern
clime
better
far
to
take
their
chances
with
xavier
at
lac
francis
than
to
purchase
the
advances
of
coin
hunters
of
our
time
the

enter
second
sons
mohammed
dammed
gift
of
god
the
sultan
second
son
enjoys
a
pilgrimage
abroad
with
eitel
fritz
the
hun
these
second
sons
of
sons
of
guns
are
sure
some
friendly
foes
but
to
what
length
their
friendship
runs
jehovah
only
knows
just
now
the
sultan
also
dines
at
williams
kultured
kourt
and
downs
the
kaiser
doctored
wines
while
kaiser
downs
his
porte
one
day
young
dammed
said
to
fritz
who
started
this
fool
row
whoever
did
was
void
of
wits
as
you
must
know
by
now
said
eitel
though
i
from
missour
some
say
it
was
my
dad
but
as
they
going
to
sure
he
wish
he
never
had
said
dammed
if
they
bag
your
dad
they
bag
my
daddy
sure
and
make
him
wish
he
never
had
come
here
to
seek
a
cure
your
father
promised
mine
to
win
from
cork
to
timbuctoo
if
we
would
throw
our
turkey
in
your
bloody
brew
besides
he
promised
on
demand
parisian
pearls
great
hunks
of
greece
manhattan
and
a
thousand
chorus
girls
he
also
swore
by
every
beard
the
prophets
ever
tore
that
great
mahomet
had
appeared
before
his
chamber
door
and
hurled
his
mantle
so
revered
the
blooming
transom
and
hence
my
foolish
father
feared
the
awful
robe
he
wore
fritz
gazed
upon
the
rolling
rhine
with
bleary
beery
eyes
and
as
he
sips
his
foaming
stein
to
dammed
thus
replies
thy
father
was
a
howling
mutt
thus
to
believe
my
sire
for
of
paper
never
cut
much
ice
with
any
liar
that
he
has
promised
you
too
much
can
not
be
well
denied
for
many
things
will
the
dutch
i
find
since
hannah
died
my
dad
and
born
started
out
to
eat
the
world
in
gobs
but
now
they
down
to
spuds
and
krout
and
what
the
army
robs
i
have
no
patience
with
the
bunch
that
failed
to
win
from
france
the
crown
prince
plainly
lacks
the
punch
why
not
give
me
a
chance
a
million
soldiers
good
and
true
went
down
to
death
for
him
and
chances
still
of
thru
are
daily
growing
slim
i
love
him
not
nor
yet
his
clique
who
deem
themselves
so
smart
i
like
to
serve
them
all
a
kick
where
their
prince
alberts
part
to
whip
the
french
they
have
to
sail
thru
blood
to
gay
paree
here
hoping
poilus
will
not
fail
to
make
crown
prince
of
me
for
o
i
love
to
have
a
peep
into
that
promised
land
thus
saying
eitel
fell
asleep
and
snored
to
beat
the
band
and
while
eitel
was
dreaming
of
something
or
other
the
son
of
the
sultan
wrote
home
to
his
mother
on
linden
when
the
sun
was
low
the
sultan
second
wrote
these
mild
impressions
of
the
foe
that
has
his
father
goat
dear
ma
according
to
my
pledge
i
write
these
lines
to
thee
while
sitting
on
the
ragged
edge
in
dear
old
germany
i
at
the
court
of
last
resort
our
royal
ali
bill
and
found
my
father
at
the
port
forgetting
all
his
ills
compared
with
livers
over
here
dad
health
is
fairly
good
and
sure
that
boy
was
full
of
cheer
on
deck
that
stood
great
doctor
kaiser
best
of
men
to
cure
dad
injects
his
kultur
now
and
then
in
dad
anatomy
this
kultur
is
a
german
germ
that
germinates
a
juice
which
in
its
turn
creates
a
worm
that
generates
the
duce
i
not
well
up
on
wormy
laws
nor
how
this
kultur
spread
i
only
know
its
use
will
cause
a
swelling
of
the
head
i
think
we
not
prolong
our
stay
there
are
no
harems
here
the
women
have
no
time
for
play
the
men
no
time
for
cheer
they
raising
crops
but
none
to
sell
as
few
would
want
their
goods
the
men
are
busy
raising
hell
the
women
raising
spuds
the
spuds
are
raising
women
sons
the
sons
all
fight
for
bill
and
thus
it
runs
that
all
the
huns
are
simply
raising
hell
i
heard
a
of
the
one
stormy
night
of
late
and
there
of
course
the
joy
was
ours
to
hear
the
of
hate
it
seems
to
be
the
only
song
that
all
the
boches
know
and
slips
with
ease
from
every
tongue
where
alles
grow
they
sang
the
with
awful
vim
and
turning
round
our
way
they
looked
at
me
and
smiled
at
as
much
as
if
to
say
not
a
turk
can
beat
that
work
was
made
in
germany
may
be
so
but
by
my
dirk
i
think
the
turk
will
try
yea
classed
with
watchdogs
of
the
rhine
and
dastard
deeds
they
done
our
dad
i
swear
doth
really
shine
a
saintly
paragon
he
felt
ashamed
that
any
race
of
earth
or
hell
below
could
so
outshine
him
to
his
face
in
hatred
of
a
foe
i
pity
the
armenian
when
dad
gets
back
to
work
again
for
he
has
tortures
now
in
store
eclipsing
all
he
knew
before
enter
the
clown
prince
the
next
upon
the
program
was
the
kaiser
eldest
son
who
sang
to
thunders
of
apeplause
land
vare
ve
and
as
his
tears
on
brussels
flow
his
voice
pathetic
grew
while
singing
solemnly
and
low
see
my
waterloo
sick
and
sore
and
sorry
and
i
licked
and
lonely
too
vile
odders
see
der
vaterland
i
see
mine
vaterloo
dear
mother
it
was
sad
i
claim
to
hear
him
blubber
so
the
blooming
boob
is
not
to
blame
for
what
he
does
know
from
infancy
they
taught
the
kid
to
bank
on
divine
and
that
no
matter
what
he
did
the
lord
was
with
his
and
so
when
shot
and
shell
and
trench
and
und
gott
und
had
failed
to
crush
the
hated
french
it
queered
his
status
quo
but
kaiser
bill
was
on
the
job
and
said
getting
late
we
dry
the
tear
and
swab
the
sob
and
sing
the
of
hate
and
so
they
sang
the
again
to
stimulate
the
prince
and
encored
with
that
sad
refrain
days
of
auld
lang
since
then
kaiser
rising
with
a
spring
said
gentlemen
our
friend
the
sultan
now
will
sing
the
jerusalem
after
that
excuse
the
joke
he
sing
that
song
of
caste
the
turkey
in
the
straw
that
broke
the
camel
back
at
last
the
kaiser
kounsel
knocked
the
spots
off
father
self
command
for
he
had
such
unholy
thots
anent
the
holy
land
but
he
was
game
as
old
mcbeth
resolved
to
do
or
die
the
odor
of
his
very
breath
was
thru
the
rye
breath
is
hot
enough
to
stew
my
blood
is
hot
within
from
being
chased
like
moses
thru
the
wilderness
of
sin
chasing
me
across
the
sand
do
mention
waterloo
from
dan
unto
beersheba
and
a
little
further
too
sand
is
hot
along
the
trail
jerusalem
how
hot
and
as
i
hear
those
bagpipes
wail
i
murmur
oh
great
scot
each
chanter
blows
a
gael
loud
strong
and
piping
hot
and
those
never
fail
to
make
me
turkey
trot
and
woe
betide
deluded
ones
who
meet
this
kilted
race
and
deem
the
grim
denuded
ones
but
females
out
of
place
engage
them
in
a
bayonet
charge
and
dupes
will
quickly
find
those
skirts
are
worn
to
camouflage
the
dynamite
behind
o
demons
of
the
fighting
line
whose
limits
are
the
earth
the
empire
great
in
which
you
shine
doth
bless
thy
place
of
birth
ubiquitous
pugnacious
scot
you
nobly
done
your
share
for
ever
where
the
fighting
hot
the
tartan
flutters
there
yea
turkey
trot
and
tanko
tune
those
dances
are
the
style
we
hop
to
their
compelling
rune
from
baltic
to
the
nile
the
kaiser
did
quite
approve
the
course
the
sultan
chose
and
deemed
it
time
that
he
should
move
the
turkish
mouth
to
close
taken
too
much
scotch
in
tow
their
praises
thus
to
sing
the
next
we
know
he
queer
the
show
and
dance
the
highland
fling
and
as
they
led
the
turk
to
bed
he
said
the
deal
was
raw
yes
raw
and
red
up
he
said
with
in
the
straw
here
bang
arose
and
cried
it
was
fair
to
stem
the
golden
flood
that
flows
from
allah
chosen
heir
is
the
will
said
kaiser
bill
rules
the
world
today
no
kings
or
khans
or
gods
or
clans
can
these
my
words
gainsay
and
then
to
prove
that
he
was
king
and
ruler
over
all
he
ordered
hindenburg
to
sing
or
rather
lead
the
bawl
then
hindenburg
mid
many
raus
essayed
a
clever
line
the
song
he
sang
with
fervor
was
on
the
rhine
the
song
a
sad
one
in
its
day
brought
some
to
verge
of
tears
but
when
they
heard
von
hinden
bray
the
place
was
near
all
jeers
off
your
line
the
singers
laugh
von
hindenburg
said
i
only
wobbling
on
the
staff
my
bass
is
weak
today
vocal
chords
are
out
of
joint
your
lines
are
running
wrong
therefore
i
think
i
will
appoint
myself
to
sing
a
song
so
saying
kaiser
bill
arose
and
clearing
out
his
throat
assumed
that
well
known
lordly
pose
and
sang
without
a
note
the
music
with
me
still
abides
my
ears
with
discord
ring
dear
mother
you
would
split
your
sides
to
hear
the
kaiser
sing
o
why
the
agony
prolong
this
was
the
burden
of
his
song
der

of

eitel
woke
and
poked
my
ribs
and
whispered
in
my
ear
the
words
to
suit
his
royal
nibs
would
thusly
run
i
fear
fair
saint
helena
is
the
maid
that
calls
thee
to
her
side
she
is
lonely
i
afraid
since
her
former
died
was
at
this
point
a
warning
dire
came
hertling
thru
the
hall
and
danced
in
words
of
lurid
fire
upon
the
gilded
wall
and
mene

the
writing

an
it
always
callin
me
the
derelict
when
seattle
was
wide
open
i
will
write
a
short
sketch
of
that
free
hearted
wretch
whom
all
fakirs
delight
to
espy
he
is
seen
every
day
just
below
yesler
way
either
full
or
distressingly
dry
he
alights
from
the
train
or
a
boat
from
the
main
with
intentions
both
honest
and
clear
but
the
wight
led
astray
before
night
is
filled
full
of
doped
whiskey
and
beer
how
alluring
and
bright
is
each
glittering
light
as
he
joyfully
watches
the
throng
and
his
spirits
are
gay
as
a
bird
are
in
may
and
as
gayly
conducive
to
song
how
seductive
the
speech
in
which
sirens
beseech
him
to
share
the
delights
of
their
spree
man
in
the
set
is
hail
fellow
well
met
and
each
woman
delightfully
free
there
a
wink
from
the
traps
and
a
meal
with
the
japs
and
a
shuffle
of
cards
as
they
go
there
a
trip
to
the
play
a
few
smiles
by
the
way
and
a
box
by
themselves
at
the
show
o
how
slyly
they
wink
as
they
sip
at
their
drink
and
maliciously
help
him
to
his
and
he
drinks
it
alas
the
foam
on
the
glass
floats
around
with
a
fizz
thus
the
night
passes
by
till
the
victimized
guy
is
sufficiently
doped
to
go
through
and
the
stupefied
lout
when
he
finally
out
will
possess
but
a
nickel
or
two
wholly
drunk
and
half
blind
with
confusion
of
mind
and
to
vultures
a
prey
he
is
found
at
the
mug
takes
a
ride
to
the
jug
and
there
slumbers
his
potions
away
coming
out
the
next
morn
sober
sick
and
forlorn
to
a
world
that
has
quickly
grown
cold
a
poor
outcast
he
roams
while
in
sumptuous
homes
whilom
friends
are
enjoying
his
gold
where
is
now
the
glib
friend
of
his
bounty
to
lend
the
poor
devil
the
price
of
a
plate
he
has
vanished
like
mist
of
the
morning
and
the
victim
is
left
to
his
fate
not
a
wink
from
a
lass
nor
a
clink
from
a
glass
with
your
health
as
it
borne
to
the
lips
not
a
sign
from
a
trap
not
a
bite
from
a
jap
all
his
sunshine
has
suffered
eclipse
not
a
kindly
invite
from
the
friends
of
the
night
to
step
in
and
have
something
on
me
not
a
drop
from
the
fakes
just
to
steady
the
shakes
and
to
knock
the
effects
of
the
spree
as
he
wanders
the
street
not
one
friend
does
he
meet
not
a
soul
that
will
greet
him
today
broke
and
hungry
alone
with
a
heartrending
moan
he
must
totter
along
to
the
bay
o
the
groans
which
now
surge
with
the
tones
of
a
dirge
from
that
soul
so
late
given
to
song
and
how
scenes
long
since
fled
like
a
wail
from
the
dead
rise
to
hasten
his
footsteps
along
yea
dim
memories
rush
to
his
mind
and
a
flush
of
deep
shame
drives
all
pallor
away
as
he
thinks
of
the
east
and
the
home
he
has
lost
by
the
life
that
leads
on
to
the
bay
robbed
and
wronged
all
around
is
the
sob
of
the
sound
but
no
mortal
comes
forward
to
save
so
with
mutterings
of
wrath
he
goes
down
to
his
death
through
the
green
clammy
depths
of
the
waves
hark
the
tones
of
despair
which
arise
on
the
air
from
the
shades
of
the
low
moaning
bay
they
will
float
through
the
years
and
encircle
the
spheres
and
be
heard
at
the
great
judgment
day
soon
a
poor
bloated
form
tossed
about
by
the
storm
floating
on
the
crest
of
each
wave
with
seaweed
for
a
shroud
is
beheld
by
the
crowd
and
a
failure
is
borne
to
his
grave
is
a
jump
from
the
train
and
a
trip
up
on
a
main
and
a
sip
with
a
friend
on
the
way
just
a
step
to
the
mug
and
a
ride
to
the
jug
then
a
leap
to
his
death
in
the
bay
but
the
lord
from
his
seat
looketh
down
on
each
street
where
such
inventions
are
on
and
with
infinite
wrath
he
will
sweep
on
their
path
and
they
reap
on
that
day
what
they
sown

discerning
the

that
is
turning
us
inside
out
the
monster
exultation
is
heard
throughout
the
nation
he
stops
at
every
station
to
spread
himself
and
no
one
can
avoid
him
is
useless
to
deride
him
impossible
to
hide
him

whence
come
those
sudden
changes
with
all
their

grim

that

there
surely
is

this
rushing
influenza
just
taken

most
certainly
will
cleanse
your

man
it
has
the
knack
to
stick

surely
turn
old
nick
blue
and
draw
his
toenails
quick
through
his

no
power
can
avail
man
to
drive
him
from
the
trail
man
the
patent
drugs
for
sale
man
can
never
cure
he
comes
against
your
will
man
and
sneaks
around
to
kill
man
the
rippling
of
his
rill
man
is
never
pure
it
droppeth
like
the
rain
man
extracted
by
the
pain
man
and
driveth
one
insane
man
to
think
of
it
it
robs
us
of

man

freezes

man

in

an

the
end
of
the
trail
i
was
summoned
in
the
gloaming
to
the
bedside
of
a
friend
who
was
passing
through
the
shadows
ever
lurking
at
the
end
to
the
bedside
of
a
comrade
i
had
known
long
long
ago
back
in
dear
old
compton
county
where
the
sugar
maples
grow
just
a
simple
son
of
lewis
careless
fearless
poor
and
proud
as
becomes
a
highland
scotsman
of
the
royal
clan
macleod
he
could
sing
the
songs
of
loveland
as
i
seldom
heard
them
sung
richest
treasures
of
the
highlands
flowed
in
music
from
his
tongue
what
a
privilege
and
pleasure
to
have
heard
him
in
his
prime
ere
his
mellow
notes
were
burdened
by
the
cruel
strains
of
time
when
the
gentle
nurse
had
brought
me
to
the
couch
of
poor
old
john
a
novice
would
not
question
that
his
race
was
nearly
run
he
was
lonely
in
the
city
longing
for
the
spruce
and
pine
and
his
eyes
grew
bright
with
pleasure
as
he
placed
his
hand
in
mine
saying
do
forget
me
angus
but
come
out
to
see
me
here
for
the
nights
are
long
and
lonely
and
the
days
devoid
of
cheer
yes
i
know
my
days
are
numbered
all
the
signs
to
me
are
plain
i
shall
never
guide
the
movements
of
the
skid
road
boys
again
there
a
secret
i
would
tell
you
that
i
never
told
before
it
was
locked
up
in
my
bosom
fifty
years
ago
or
more
it
of
mary
gentle
mary
whom
i
loved
in
years
agone
loved
her
then
and
will
forever
and
my
mary
loved
her
john
but
there
came
another
wooer
who
was
rich
as
i
was
poor
and
her
parents
looked
with
favor
on
this
keeper
of
a
store
i
was
wounded
yes
and
angry
that
their
greed
should
thus
deny
me
the
place
they
held
for
riches
so
i
bade
them
all
good
bye
and
i
left
my
mary
weeping
though
she
begged
of
me
to
stay
left
her
weeping
to
my
sorrow
and
i
westward
took
my
way
then
i
drifted
hither
thither
like
the
flotsam
of
the
sea
every
year
a
little
farther
from
my
home
in
tallabharee
till
at
last
i
came
to
anchor
on
the
shores
of
puget
sound
where
so
many
of
my
comrades
in
misfortune
may
be
found
here
his
speech
grew
slow
and
halting
as
he
said
amid
his
groans
he
had
feared
for
what
might
happen
to
his
poor
old
aching
bones
do
not
let
them
sink
my
body
where
the
derelicts
are
thrown
for
although
i
poor
in
pocket
pride
was
bred
within
my
bone
when
my
limbs
refuse
their
burden
and
i
can
not
further
go
and
the
trail
is
dark
and
tangled
where
the
fir
and
cedars
grow
when
the
cord
of
life
is
severed
and
in
death
i
lying
low
and
there
nothing
left
but
tallabh
of
the
john
you
used
to
know
lay
me
down
amid
the
shadows
of
the
forest
that
i
love
with
the
grey
green
moss
around
me
and
the
skies
of
god
above
where
no
noises
will
disturb
me
save
the
whisper
of
the
woods
and
the
dismal
hooting
in
the
primal
solitudes
where
the
crooning
voice
of
nature
chants
the
glory
of
the
west
let
the
groves
of
god
hold
vigil
my
everlasting
rest
over
there
beyond
the
shadows
i
will
find
my
mary
dear
and
we
cruise
the
trails
together
that
we
missed
so
sadly
here
when
again
i
looked
upon
him

wrapped
him
in
its

songs

and
the

are
fall

look
sharp
and
do
be
late
signed
sergeant
major
larry
of
the
gallant
come
my
boys
you
need
not
grumble
you
have
but
to
grin
and
yield
for
brave
kitchener
not
in
it
when
bold
larry
on
the
field
when
we
started
down
from
scotstown
we
were
just
as
big
as
him
but
his
honors
won
so
quickly
made
the
rest
of
us
look
slim
o
he
swelled
in
regimentals
till
he
quite
outgrew
his
tent
but
he
get
the
one
he
asked
for
when
old
hogan
pays
his
rent
o
we
are
loyal
volunteers
our
red
coats
prove
us
so
we
are
ready
aye
and
willing
now
to
meet
our
country
foe
who
would
not
be
proud
of
canada
and
for
her
sake
to
bleed
for
success
would
crown
our
efforts
if
bold
larry
took
the
lead
yes
the
sword
that
dangles
by
his
a
borrowed
one
i
know
but
it
matters
not
to
larry
as
it
helps
to
make
a
show
see
him
strut
around
the
camp
ground
like
a
peacock
in
the
grass
and
the
staff
will
send
him
higher
when
it
needs
a
boom
in
brass
such
was
larry
bold
in
peace
time
he
was
brave
as
lochinvar
but
he
quickly
changed
his
music
as
the
bugle
called
for
war
when
the
highlanders
grew
wrathy
with
their
hair
straight
up
on
end
sergeant
larry
dropped
at
bury
as
he
wished
to
see
a
friend
we
were
left
without
a
leader
and
the
riot
louder
swelled
divers
scotsmen
drew
their
bayonets
and
for
blood
they
madly
yelled
car
was
full
of
soldiers
noisy
as
salvation
drum
on
the
day
we
left
camp
rockland
and
the
troops
came
shouting
home
after
larry
comes
the
colonel
and
a
valiant
man
is
he
tho
he
never
led
his
forces
from
atlanta
to
the
sea
yet
if
the
country
needs
him
every
clansman
will
awake
from
old
hampton
down
to
weedon
and
from
lingwick
to
the
lake
we
will
conquer
with
our
music
if
our
fighting
fails
to
win
whom
bold
larry
can
not
vanquish
we
will
silence
with
our
din
thus
we
proudly
march
to
glory
and
in
midst
of
all
the
fray
we
be
cheered
by
french
of
scotstown
as
he
whistles
cabar
faidth
and
mclennan
with
his
bagpipes
he
a
brass
band
in
himself
we
will
have
him
with
his
music
to
conjure
the
fighting
elf
there
is
nothing
so
inspiring
as
a
loyal
tune
or
song
to
arouse
a
soldier
spirits
and
to
cheer
the
boys
along
we
will
have
them
there
from
scotstown
from
ben
gal
and
echo
vale
men
imbued
with
faith
and
courage
highland
traits
which
never
fail
and
to
swell
the
fighting
faction
we
the
twins
of
murray
clan
who
can
fight
their
weight
in
wildcats
not
to
mention
mortal
man
and
we
armies
to
fall
back
on
whose
supply
will
never
fail
troops
which
cross
the
wild
atlantic
on
all
ships
of
steam
or
sail
you
will
find
them
throughout
canada
wherever
you
may
roam
and

as

must

a
date
supreme
in
lingwick
social
lore
as
on
that
eve
the
ladies
all
came
forth
to
give
their
ball
and
long
ere
ten
the
dancing
hall
was
crowded
to
the
door
since
scottish
heroes
sang
duans
upon
the
field
of
prestonpans
so
fine
a
gathering
of
the
clans
was
surely
never
seen
and
brilliant
byron
ladies
fair
who
danced
in
belgium
balmy
air
could
never
with
our
girls
compare
in

realm
i
ween
were
i

burns
i
sing
their
praise
in
grateful
sympathetic
lays
and
tell
them
how
a
bard
repays
the
smiles
on
him
bestowed
o
for
a
pure
poetic
drift
or
bard
mcritchie
splendid
gift
to
give
those
charming
girls
a
lift
on
chummy
hymen
road
since
first
the
red
man
trod
those
lands
in
happy
reckless
roving
bands
where
now
the
town
of
lingwick
stands
until
the
present
time
no
festal
scene
deserved
such
note
of
such
a
scene
no
poet
wrote
tho
painted
with
a
double
coat
of
stirring
prose
or
rhyme
the
lively
galson
girls
were
there
with
dancing
eyes
and
wavy
hair
and
roses
stamped
by
caller
air
on
every
blooming
cheek
and
other
ladies
fair
and
bright
who
live
near
by
were
there
that
night
contributing
the
keen
delight
of
beauty
so
to
speak
oh
bachelors
how
sweet
to
glide
with
such
bright
charmers
by
one
side
and
heart
a
surging
tide
of
sentiment
you
might
perambulate
around
until
you
hear
the
trumpet
sound
no
better
quarters
could
be
found
to
pitch
your
earthly
tent
at
the
ladies
came
and
took
each
blushing
humbled
swain
across
the
road
where
eddie
dame
had
placed
a
royal
feast
each
charmer
paid
alas
how
rare
her
own
and
hungry
fellow
fare
and
splendid
food
was
furnished
there
for
an
hour
at
least
we
must
congratulate
each
belle
from
mountain
vale
and
fisher
hill
who
paid
her
tax
so
well
last
friday
night
at
gould
had
we
our
wish
we
gladly
call
twice
yearly
for
a
ball
for
surely
we
were
happy
all
the
while
the
women
ruled
and
we
beseech
you
throw
your
charms
around
the
lonely
mountain
farms
where
bachelors
are
up
in
arms
against
your
luring
spell
fan
to
a
flame
the
sluggish
smoke
place
gibourd
in
a
double
yoke
and
give
friend
finlay
ian
a
poke
to
keep
him
hale
and
well
dear

up
your
enterprise
and
dazzle
all
those

und
me
how
we
settled
the
alaskan
boundary
question
these
lines
were
penned
long
before
the
breaking
out
of
the
present
great
war
note
the
remarkable
spirit
of
prophesy
which
pervaded
the
poem
especially
its
allusion
to
the
armenians
now
that
little
venezuela
has
her
navy
back
in
tow
with
the
allies
in
the
distance
waiting
for
the
promised
dough
it
may
not
be
deemed
improper
for
the
mind
that
loves
to
roam
just
to
focus
its
attention
on
some
matters
nearer
home
we
are
also
growing
weary
of
the
war
clouds
in
the
east
which
bob
up
to
entertain
us
once
or
twice
a
year
at
least
and
we
bear
the
bobbing
better
if
it
did
not
always
bring
to
the
concert
of
the
powers
an
unfailing
chance
to
sing
they
are
masterful
musicians
with
chin
music
as
their
forte
and
a
penchant
strong
for
love
songs
when
they
serenade
the
porte
while
they
sing
the
sultan
dances
like
a
strolling
dago
bear
till
one
really
feels
the
presence
of
roast
turkey
in
the
air
thus
they
exorcise
the
spirit
of
destruction
in
the
turk
and
adjure
the
imp
to
vamoose
and
forego
its
bloody
work
doth
he
vamoose
yes
a
season
to
return
with
seven
more
while
the
sultan
still
and
his
fingers
still
in
gore
but
we
leave
this
doubtful
concert
and
its
tones
meant
to
drown
the
voice
appealing
in
the
dying
christian
groans
and
examine
rather
closer
into
troubles
of
our
own
to
uproot
the
crops
of
mischief
which
old
satan
may
have
sown
people
must
with
friendly
feelings
and
the
best
intentions
try
to
elucidate
the
muddle
termed
alaskan
boundary
there
a
rumble
in
that
region
and
it
should
louder
grow
just
a
little
cloud
of
worry
the
flurry
of
the
snow
why
oh
why
should
kindred
people
quarrel
over
hunks
of
ice
if
they
knew
each
other
better
they
would
settle
in

miss
canada
is
frigid

columbia
is
cold
so
in

there
an
iciness
untold
harken
to
the
one
bemoaning
up
among
the
northern
lights
how
that
is
a
squatter
and
encroaching
on
her
rights
it
is

asked
her
to
vacate
can
you
guess
the
jade
response
why
she
sweetly
smiled
and
answered
you
my
dear
alphonse
thus
the
question
rests
at
present
till
the
arbitrators
meet
and
we
trust
when
said
time
cometh
they
will
gravely
take
their
seat
near
the
base
of
all
the
trouble
on
the
apex
of
the
pole
where
they
exercise
the
virtue
at
the
least
of
keeping

furl
your

then
ye

in
a
truce
of

till
this
august

settles
where
the

the
lumberjack
we
have
songs
on
many
topics
new
and
old
beneath
the
sun
but
alas
in
many
cases
minstrelsy
is
overdone
so
i
sing
a
song
of
labor
where
the
muse
is
rather
slack
and
my
theme
shall
be
of
timber
and
the
hardy
lumberjack
now
republican
traditions
are
so
grafted
in
our
bones
that
monarchs
of
the
forest
must
be
tumbled
from
their
thrones
and
to
raze
those
ancient
strongholds
we
have
armies
of
the
axe
plucky
pioneers
of
progress
known
to
all
as
lumberjacks
he
may
lack
the
wings
of
angels
and
the
sanctity
of
saints
if
a
town
in
need
of
painting
he
may
furnish
all
the
paints
yet
he
lapses
but
a
moment
and
again
he
hies
him
back
close
unto
the
heart
of
nature
does
the
lonesome
lumberjack
there
amid
his
wild
surroundings
and
the
crooning
of
the
trees
he
finds
balm
for
mind
and
body
borne
on
every
passing
breeze
there
is
something
strangely
healing
in
the
magic
of
the
myrrh
in
the
odor
of
the
cedar
and
the
fragrance
of
the
fir
grind
your
axes
o
my
heroes
point
your
peavies
file
your
saws
let
your
ropes
and
chains
and
cables
be
examined
now
for
flaws
fire
up
the
iron
donkey
till
each
rivet
feels
the
strain
lumberjack
has
had
his
outing
and
returns
to
camp
again
there
is
music
in
the
axe
fall
as
it
sounds
upon
the
ear
there
is
music
in
the
sawing
when
the
dust
is
flying
clear
aye
there
music
for
the
lumberjack
magnificent
of
sound
in
the
crashing
of
the
timber
as
it
thunders
to
the
ground
he
will
never
lack
for
music
while
the
owl
is
keeping
time
with
the
ceaseless
serenading
of
the
frog
within
the
slime
but
the
music
ever
sounding
with
the
sweetest
of
appeals
is
the
of
the
iron
gong
that
calls
him
to
his
meals
he
a
credit
to
his
calling
to
his
country
and
his
clan
there
is
not
a
dude
among
them
every
lumberjack
a
man
and
you
find
him
ever
cheerful
in
the
sunshine
or
the
rain
from
the
camps
of
columbia
to
the
lumber
camps
of
maine
he
may
show
a
rough
exterior
but
his
heart
is
warm
within
mark
him
poring
that
letter
just
received
from
home
and
kin
tears
will
gather
hot
and
blinding
and
he
can
not
hold
them
back
reading
words
from
distant
loved
ones
to
their
absent
lumberjack
is
perchance
a
loving
message
from
a
sweetheart
far
away
or
a
tender
admonition
from
a
mother
old
and
gray
o
ye
lumberjacks
remember
that
wherever
ye
may
roam
there
are
anxious
hearts
awaiting
for
an
answer
back
at
home
when
the
sun
in
golden
glory
hath
descended
in
the
west
they
indulge
in
song
and
story
till
they
seek
their
bunks
for
rest
there
to
dream
of
scenes
of
childhood
amid
mountain
stream
or
glen
till
old
sol
in
morning
splendor
calls
them
to
their
tasks
again
soft
and
soothing
are
the
voices
as
the
shades
of
evening
fall
stealing
gently
through
the
forest
brooding
calmly
over
all
by
yon
lake
a
loon
is
calling
and
the
night
bird
answers
back
keeping
vigil
the
slumbers
of
the
weary
lumberjack
o
the
lumberjack
is
loyal
and
he
surely
see
to
it
in
the
grind
against
the
kaiser
that
each
axe
will
do
its
bit
he
will
spruce
up
for
the
allies
till
ten

canadians
guard

during
the
boer
war
at
a
time
when
the
british
forces
were
suffering
severe
reverses
a
certain
quebec
paper
stated
that
the
british
empire
was
built
on
feet
of
clay
and
predicted
that
it
would
like
its
babylonian
prototype
suffer
a
sudden
fall
we
trust
it
a
long
long
way
to
that
fall
and
thank

the
dear
old

false

on

the

stands

braves
tempestuous

write

compare

sot
whose

doomed
old
babylon
is
it
because
you

is
it
because
you
love

you
thus
assail
with
bitter

the

may
it
wave

of
the

a

our

no

our

needs
no

let
still
be
true

a

our

then
why
should
we
thus
disagree

the

clear
the
time
is
near
when
racial
strife
will
vanish
quite

an

is
it
not
our
bounden
right
to
uphold
with
all
our
might
and
with
tongue
and
pen
to
fight
for
our
native
gaelic
guard
the
language
known
to
eve
ere
the
serpent
did
deceive
and
the
last
one
we
believe
mellow
matchless
gaelic
pity
the
disloyal
clown
who
will
dwell
awhile
in
town
and
returning
wear
a
frown
if
he
hears
the
gaelic
is
amusing
to
behold
little
misses
ten
years
old
when
they
leave
the
country
fold
how
they
lose
the
gaelic
some
gay
natives
of
the
soil
cross
the
line
a
little
while
and
returning
deem
it
style
to
deny
the
gaelic
lads
and
lassies
in
their
teens
wearing
airs
of
kings
and
queens
just
a
taste
of
boston
beans
makes
them
lose
their
gaelic
they
return
with
finer
clothes
speaking
yankee
through
their
nose
that
the
way
the
gaelic
goes
pop
goes
the
gaelic
tho
the
tony
set
teach
them
quickly
to
forget
they
will
all
be
loyal
yet
to
their
mother
gaelic
then
abjure
such
silly
pride
cast
the
ragged
thing
aside
let
your
mongrel
english
slide
rather
than
the
gaelic
what
a
dire
calamity
and
how
lonesome
we
would
be
if

of
donald

of
north

lingwick
who
died
of
smallpox
at
flagstaff
arizona
on
the
day
of
march
the
sun
hath
set
and
leaves
the
day
as
when
the
soul
hath
left
its
clay
the
pale
soft
tints
of
twilight
spread
from
east
to
west
the
evening
breeze
that
fans
my
cheek
with
mellow
cadence
seems
to
speak
then
sighing
onward
through
the
dusk
it
sinks
to
rest
on
nights
like
this
my
fancy
strays
to
loved
ones
lost
in
other
days
whom
gold
had
tempted
to
the
sunset
land
afar
brave
boys
whose
hopes
of
future
wealth
were
blasted
by
thy
power
o
death
whose
mandates
wage
on
old
and
young
a
constant
war
among
the
lads
so
kind
and
true
who
sought
the
land
of
golden
hue
to
meet
amid
its
glittering
hopes
an
early
doom
was
lingwick
strongest
lealest
man
the
joy
and
pride
of
all
his
clan
as
brave
a
youth
as
ever
graced
a
compton
home
dear
comrade
of
my
younger
days
my
muse
is
weak
to
sing
thy
praise
but
love
is
strong
so
feeble
be
my
strain
and
though
you
sleeping
cold
and
still
on
flagstaff
distant
hill
fond
memory
often
flits
to
thee
across
the
plain
i
loved
childhood
days
were
passed
i
love
you
on
until
the
last
when
the
clouds
of
death
approach
i
think
of
thee
oh
bitter
fate
oh
woeful
hour
that
cut
thee
down
in
power
thrice
bitter
if
death
chains
could
bind
eternally
but
blessed
promise
hopeful
friend
that
tells
us
death
is
not
the
end
that
brighter
prospects
loom
for
all
beyond
the
wave
oh
sing
aloud
the
glad
refrain
that
friend
with
friend
will
meet
again
for
love
like
this
can
be
conquered
by
the
grave
what
though
the
red
men
roam
at
will
from
arid
plain
to
cooler
hill
regardless
of
the
mounds
that
lie
amid
the
groves
what
though
our
children
find
their
graves
with
ghosts
of
long
departed
braves
the
spot
is
one
the
god
of
nature
dearly
loves
in
arizona
distant
land
where
cyclones
drift
the
heated
sand
and
where
the
tall
majestic
pine
tree
branches
wave
where
gaunt
coyotes
prowl
for
prey
through
storm
and
calm
by
night
and
day
there
in
their
midst
there
lies
a
lone
neglected
grave
were
eloquence
immortal
mine
i
sing
of
scenes
the
most
sublime
of
any
nature
ever
lavished
here
below
god
majesty
seems
here
unfurled
as
elsewhere
not
in
all
the
world
an
earthly
paradise
by
heaven
glow
how
fitting
that
thy
sun
went
down
so
near
the
spot
that
wears
earth
crown
the
colorado
canyon
country
weird
and
dim
no
grander
land
beneath
the
skies
in
which
to
die
in
which
to
rise
and
nature
god
will
care
for
all
who
sleep
in
him
what
though
alas
fond
earthly
hopes
are
buried
in
yon
western
slopes
and
gentle
mothers
grieve
for
loved
ones
lying
there
though
maidens
sigh
with
sad
unrest
for
lovers
true
who
died
out
west
the
bitter
heartache
soon
will
cease
and
all
be
fair
but
donald
manly
voice
still
rings
within
our
ears
and
memory
clings
to
all
the
charms
that
marked
his
life
while
still
below
and
often
now
our
fancy
flight
doth
wing
its
journey
to
that
night
that
marks
his
lonely
death
amid
the
mountain
snow
the
prairie
wolves
of
stealthy
tread
already
seemed
to
scent
the
dead
their
fitful
howls
were
borne
upon
the
midnight
air
the
western
world
was
wrapped
in
gloom
from
sandy
waste
to
dome
when
donald
closed
his
weary
eyes
and
passed
from
care
the
air
within
the
mountain
camp
was
uncongenial
cold
and
damp
and
springtide
gales
were
moaning
dismally
outside
no
loving
hand
was
there
to
press
his
fevered
brow
with
fond
caress
no
gentle
voice
to
whisper
comfort
when
he
died
dear
balloch
ban
now
at
rest
thy
sun
went
down
far
in
the
west
alas
no
more
to
rise
until
the
judgment
day
no
truer
heart
ceased
to
beat
no
braver
soul
o
death
did
greet
thy
awful
presence
since
the
earth
hath
owned
thy
sway
and
now
he
sleeps
beneath
the
sod
where
grand
old
mountain
pine
trees
nod
their
lofty
plumes
beneath
the
distant
dome
oh
stranger
should
you
linger
near
drop
on
this
lonely
grave
a
tear
in
memory
of
the
boy
that
sleeps
so
far
from
home
over
the
top
a
lusty
lad
from
lewis
bright
gem
from
britain
crown
assailed
by
huns
with
gas
and
guns
in
no
man
land
was
down
no
power
on
earth
can
save
him
is
madness
then
to
try
still
to
the
deed
sprang
forth
with
speed
a
balloch
ban
from
skye
he
volunteered
to
enter
that
zone
of
certain
death
and
unafraid
went
forth
to
aid
while
thousands
held
their
breath
thru
all
that
hell
of
fire
he
sped
like
mountain
deer
on
ground
his
comrade
found
and
bore
him
to
the
rear
their
comrades
gather
them
to
do
what
mortals
can
but
cruel
fate
they
found
them
beyond

went
over

now
torn
by
shot
and

ye

done
your

broken

over

like
birds
of

back
to

over

bestowing
the

of

dear
lusty

from

brave
boy
from

in
this
great
war
you
show
us
how
bravely
men
can
die
the
alkali
land
or
i
would
go
i
left
my
old
home
and
my
friends
in
the
east
ambitious
to
better
my
fortunes
forsooth
and
seek
amid
scenes
of
the
strenuous
west
the
gold
which
had
gilded
the
dreams
of
my
youth
but
gold
not
alone
was
the
dochus
mo
chree
which
painted
that
faraway
country
so
fair
a
lure
more
compelling
was
beckoning
me
the
maiden
i
loved
since
my
childhood
was
there
i
did
what
a
man
without
money
must
do
just
walked
when
the
brakies
were
looking
too
sharp
i
sang
when
i
felt
in
the
humor
is
true
when
lonesome
like
david
i
hung
up
my
harp
i
envied
the
lot
of
the
fellow
inside
who
traveled
in
comfort
asleep
or
awake
while
i
of
all
comfort
and
slumber
denied
was
beating
my
way
on
the
beam
of
a
brake
thus
onward
i
journeyed
by
night
and
by
day
combating
the
problems
of
food
and
of
rest
content
as
i
traveled
the
wearisome
way
to
know
i
was
nearing
the
wonderful
west
my
pilgrimage
first
uneventful
and
slow
changed
color
as
texas
vast
reaches
i
struck
arizona
the
arid
and
new
mexico
half
hell
and
half
heaven
were
also
my
luck
when
tortured
and
weak
by
the
heat
of
the
sand
and
swollen
my
tongue
and
the
water
was
done
i
wondered
no
more
as
i
passed
through
the
land
at
the
myriad
bones
bleaching
white
in
the
sun
yes
on
as
i
plodded
the
limitless
range
in
that
land
of
hot
sand
and
eternal
clear
skies
how
oft
in
my
thirst
did
i
long
for
a
change
to
my
own
native
hills
where
the
watersprings
rise
o
compton
beloved
what
visions
arose
of
thy
hills
and
dark
vales
and
thy
cold
mountain
streams
and
each
fuadhran
d
which
bubbles
and
flows
on
the
farm
back
at
home
in
the
land
of
my
dreams
some
tell
me
the
beauty
of
nature
abroad
surpasses
in
grandeur
the
country
we
boast
they
alter
their
views
if
they
traversed
the
road
i
wearily
tramped
on
my
way
to
the
coast
there
may
be
a
spot
in
some
faraway
clime
where
nature
in
robes
of
perfection
is
dressed
but
give
me
her
moods
and
her
image
sublime
as
seen
in
the
wild
woolly
wastes
of
the
west
i
slept
with
the
red
men
who
roam
through
that
land
gaunt
remnant
that
tells
of
the
white
man
abuse
and
often
although
i
could
not
understand
was
i
lulled
by
the
soft
clucking
language
they
use
we
never
took
thought
on
occasions
like
these
of
the
dangers
which
lurked
as
we
lay
on
the
ground
though
the
howl
of
coyote
was
borne
past
on
the
breeze
and
the
rattlesnake
coiled
with
an
ominous
sound
asleep
the
stars
of
that
beautiful
clime
in
the
shadowy
gloom
that
same
mesa
had
cast
undisturbed
in
my
slumbers
i
dream
of
the
time
when
the
long
dreary
miles
still
ahead
would
be
passed
mysterious
mesas
how
ghostly
ye
loom
how
spectral
and
huge
the
alkali
waste
the
secrets
of
ages
thy
vastness
entomb
are
seemingly
safe
in
thy
mystical
breast
when
shadows
of
even
crept
over
the
land
and
mountains
around
me
grew
ghostly
and
grey
the
fringe
of
the
foothills
i
anxiously
scanned
for
lithe
tawny
forms
ever
prowling
for
prey
oft
during
my
journey
i
fancied
that
rain
fell
cool
from
a
cloud
on
my
lips
yet
cloudless
the
sky
that
quivering
plain
was
the
last
ray
of
hope
undergoing
eclipse
at
times
would
the
lure
of
this
mirage
prevail
till
reason
returning
i
hasten
me
back
for
i
knew
the
safe
trail
was
to
follow
the
rail
gleaming
hot
in
the
sun
on
the
santa
fe
track
the
phantoms
of
fever
thus
beckoned
in
vain
where
better
and
stronger
than
i
had
been
lost
though
the
hell
of
mohave
was
scorching
my
brain
i
crossed
it
in
safety
and
struck
for
the
coast
o
boundless
pacific
i
deem
it
no
loss
to
flee
to
thy
arms
from
the
cactus
and
sand
how
sweet
on
thy
deep
heaving
bosom
to
toss
after
parching
so
long
in
the
alkali
land
i
boarded
a
schooner
that
slopped
in
the
bay
a
tub
of
a
ship
for
seattle
outbound
and
up
from
old
frisco
we
wallowed
our
way
to
lovely
seattle
the
queen
of
the
sound
and
there
on
a
hill
in
a
beautiful
spot
overlooking
lake
union
low
murmuring
wave
the
love
of
my
youth
whom
so
long
i
had
sought
alone
among
strangers
i
found
in
her
grave
footnote
footnote
d
water
spring
a
christmas
dream
on
christmas
night
i
sallied
forth
to
the
red
mountain
in
the
north
the
bright
abode
of
men
of
worth
here
and
heaven
where
finlay
stakes
in
mother
earth
are
firmly
driven
i
ambled
up
the
village
road
past
many
an
irishman
abode
and
carried
quite
a
heavy
load
the
most
inside
i
faith
sincerely
thanked
the
code
the
way
was
wide
here
conscience
loudly
whispered
dhu
how
oft
hath
it
been
told
to
you
the
end
that
way
would
lead
you
to
should
you
persist
with
soldiers
of
the
ribbon
blue
at
once
enlist
i
answered
conscience
give
me
peace
the
time
of
pledges
draws
apace
when
we
must
swear
to
shun
the
glass
and
all
its
riot
we
but
a
single
week
of
grace
so
let
enjoy
it
i
followed
up
by
keenan
gate
unto
the
turn
where
two
ways
meet
thence
to
the
left
the
mountain
street
would
guide
me
right
tho
for
my
life
i
could
not
just
in
that
light
for
where
two
highways
ran
before
i
saw
a
dozen
tracks
or
more
and
which
to
take
i
was
sure
by
either
eye
was
but
a
chance
against
a
score
and
yet
i
try
i
started
on
with
divers
tacks
and
strove
to
reconcile
the
tracks
which
darted
round
like
jumping
jacks
before
my
gaze
take
a
dozen
crowd
a
cacks
their
course
to
trace
had
i
big
john
and
eddie
charts
to
tell
me
where
the
highway
parts
reducing
by
their
magic
arts
nineteen
to
two
i
would
have
from
my
heart
of
hearts
poured
blessings
due
confusion
worse
confounded
gee
on
every
track
a
horse
i
see
and
all
alike
it
seems
to
me
as
barley
scones
i
vow
pete
gagne
cavalry
proud
prancing
roans
their
bones
were
rattling
in
the
cold
like
vales
of
which
ezekiel
told
a
few
indeed
did
seem
too
old
to
nibble
corn
the
colt
among
them
all
was
foaled
ere
smoke
was
born
ah
crippled
gaunt
and
steed
thy
woes
are
great
your
want
is
feed
reminds
me
of
bunker
breed
that
gasps
for
breath
aye
one
and
all
are
built
for
speed
to
certain
death
i
asked
the
leader
of
the
band
if
he
could
tell
upon
which
hand
the
mountain
turnpike
pierced
the
land
around
those
parts
i
shipped
a
sea
i
told
him
and
had
lost
my
charts
the
left
he
answered
with
a
yell
tis
easy
sir
your
course
to
tell
and
that
will
lead
you
down
to
well
to
robert
road
then
straight
away
on
yonder
hill
is
smoke
abode
the
right
hand
road
you
must
not
take
as
that
will
lead
to
moffat
lake
where
cookshire
sportsmen
saw
big
snake
through
alden
glass
and
thots
of
serpents
make
me
quake
from
head
to
cass
i
gave
my
guide
a
social
wink
and
started
on
is
cha
ro
blink
till
my
exuberance
i
think
broke
into
song
i
said
good
evening
to
the
mink
and
passed
along
the
air
was
keen
the
night
was
bright
and
in
the
north
that
mystic
light
in
my
exaggerated
sight
was
one
to
please
the
whole
suggested
yellow
white
or
greenish
cheese
i
gained
momentum
down
the
ridge
and
jumped
john
moggish
bridge
then
climbed
the
mountain
hedge
by
hedge
unto
the
crest
and
thought
it
there
my
privilege
to
take
a
rest
i
could
not
find
the
mountain
store
which
channel
mentioned
in
his
leor
my
vision
better
than
before
i
really
think
aye
c
accounts
for
one
or
more
and
he
do
drink
but
stores
aside
i
wandered
on
to
where
the
school
house
windows
shone
altho
there
seemed
to
me
but
one
a
dancing
glare
i
thought
the
northern
lights
were
on
the
programme
there
and
just
within
o
hully
gee
is
that
a
single
christmas
tree
or
is
my
vision
still
aglee
for
lack
of
breath
a
moving
forest
do
i
see
as
saw
macbeth
and
better
still
the
forest
gleams
with
all
a
youngster
most
esteems
a
greater
crop
as
groaning
beams
did
there
attest
than
tupper
saw
in
wildest
dreams
of
wheat
out
west
and
bachelors
might
they
be
fewer
i
thought
i
see
you
single
sure
but
there
they
sit
at
least
a
score
on
benches
stuck
each
one
a
wilted
lone
wall
flower
awaiting
pluck
we
pray
you
o
assultin
turk
so
noted
for
unholy
work
to
send
his
devilship
your
clerk
across
the
seas
to
drive
our
single
men
to
kirk
with
marriage
fees
or
send
armenians
not
yet
dead
and
take
our
bachelors
instead
should
you
then
hanker
for
their
head
just
plant
their
hide
and
thus
avoid
that
hellish
dread
infanticide
illustration
finlay
like
your
own
you
never
behold
i
reason
now
to
stare
for
are
there
not
two
finlays
there
and
only
one
on
earth
i
swear
come
off
my
hat
a
worthier
to
fill
a
chair
has
never
sat
red
mountain
thy
neglect
condone
within
that
chair
your
bard
enthrone
instead
of
bread
do
give
a
stone
as
others
do
another
finlay
like
your
own
you
never
know
sweet
singer
may
your
mother
tongue
embellished
by
thy
gift
of
song
be
ever
heard
the
clans
among
while
print
is
read
may
future
bards
thy
notes
prolong
when
thou
art
dead
thus
on
and
on
while
cycles
roll
may
gaelic
language
of
the
soul
be
heard
in
song
from
pole
to
pole
from
east
to
west
until
the
final
tempests
bowl
this
earth
to
rest
concluding
i
would
humbly
ask
all
hypocrites
to
shun
the
task
of
shooting
from
behind
a
mask
their
fellow
men
and
help
us
all
to
fling
our
flask
to
hinnom
glen
we
heard
the
loud
despairing
moan
of
sinners
reaping
what
they
sown
in
midnight
fields
with
thistles
grown
where
devils
glean
yet
let
the
first
to
cast
a
stone
himself
be
clean
no
living
mortal
can
invite
the
gaze
of
creatures
who
delight
in
showing
spots
upon
the
white
which
god
hath
alas
alas
a
little
spite
will
find
the
stain
but
who
to
judge
the
serpent
there
in

breathes

with
skill
