aedh
tells
of
the
rose
in
his
heart
all
things
uncomely
and
broken
all
things
worn
out
and
old
the
cry
of
a
child
by
the
roadway
the
creak
of
a
lumbering
cart
the
heavy
steps
of
the
ploughman
splashing
the
wintry
mould
are
wronging
your
image
that
blossoms
a
rose
in
the
deeps
of
my
heart
the
wrong
of
unshapely
things
is
a
wrong
too
great
to
be
told
i
hunger
to
build
them
anew
and
sit
on
a
green
knoll
apart
with
the
earth
and
the
sky
and
the
water
remade
like
a
casket
of
gold
for
my
dreams
of
your
image
that
blossoms
a
rose
in
the
deeps
of
my
heart
the
host
of
the
air
drove
with
a
song
the
wild
duck
and
the
drake
from
the
tall
and
the
tufted
reeds
of
the
drear
hart
lake
and
he
saw
how
the
reeds
grew
dark
at
the
coming
of
night
tide
and
dreamed
of
the
long
dim
hair
of
bridget
his
bride
he
heard
while
he
sang
and
dreamed
a
piper
piping
away
and
never
was
piping
so
sad
and
never
was
piping
so
gay
and
he
saw
young
men
and
young
girls
who
danced
on
a
level
place
and
bridget
his
bride
among
them
with
a
sad
and
a
gay
face
the
dancers
crowded
about
him
and
many
a
sweet
thing
said
and
a
young
man
brought
him
red
wine
and
a
young
girl
white
bread
but
bridget
drew
him
by
the
sleeve
away
from
the
merry
bands
to
old
men
playing
at
cards
with
a
twinkling
of
ancient
hands
the
bread
and
the
wine
had
a
doom
for
these
were
the
host
of
the
air
he
sat
and
played
in
a
dream
of
her
long
dim
hair
he
played
with
the
merry
old
men
and
thought
not
of
evil
chance
until
one
bore
bridget
his
bride
away
from
the
merry
dance
he
bore
her
away
in
his
arms
the
handsomest
young
man
there
and
his
neck
and
his
breast
and
his
arms
were
drowned
in
her
long
dim
hair
scattered
the
cards
and
out
of
his
dream
awoke
old
men
and
young
men
and
young
girls
were
gone
like
a
drifting
smoke
but
he
heard
high
up
in
the
air
a
piper
piping
away
and
never
was
piping
so
sad
and
never
was
piping
so
gay

you
hide
in
the
ebb

flow
of

pale
tide
when
the
moon
has
set
the
people
of
coming
days
will
know
about
the
casting
out
of
my
net
and
how
you
have
leaped
times
out
of
mind
over
the
little
silver
cords
and
think
that
you
were
hard
and
unkind
and
blame
you
with
many
bitter
words
a
cradle
song
the
danann
children
laugh
in
cradles
of
wrought
gold
and
clap
their
hands
together
and
half
close
their
eyes

they
will
ride
the
north

the
flies
with
heavy
whitening
wings
and
a
heart
fallen
cold

kiss
my
wailing
child
and
press
it
to
my
breast

the
narrow
graves
calling
my
child
and
me
desolate
winds
that
cry
over
the
wandering
sea
desolate
winds
that
hover
in
the
flaming
west
desolate
winds
that
beat
the
doors
of
heaven
and
beat
the
doors
of
hell
and
blow
there
many
a
whimpering
ghost
o

unappeasable

fall
from
you

burning
in
fires

slanderous

heaped

there
the
mystical
brotherhood
of
sun

and

work
out
their

the

the
song
of
wandering
aengus
i
went
out
to
the
hazel
wood
because
a
fire
was
in
my
head
and
cut
and
peeled
a
hazel
wand
and
hooked
a
berry
to
a
thread
and
when
white
moths
were
on
the
wing
and
stars
were
flickering
out
i
dropped
the
berry
in
a
stream
and
caught
a
little
silver
trout
when
i
had
laid
it
on
the
floor
i
went
to
blow
the
fire
but
something
rustled
on
the
floor
and
someone
called
me
by
my
name
it
had
become
a
glimmering
girl
with
apple
blossom
in
her
hair
who
called
me
by
my
name
and
ran
and
faded
through
the
brightening
air
though
i
am
old
with
wandering
through
hollow
lands
and
hilly
lands
i
will
find
out
where
she
has
gone
and
kiss
her
lips
and
take
her
hands
and
walk
among
long
dappled
grass
and
pluck
till
time
and
times
are
done
the
silver
apples
of
the
moon
the
golden
apples
of
the
sun
the
song
of
the
old
mother
i
rise
in
the
dawn
and
i
kneel
and
blow
till
the
seed
of
the
fire
flicker
and
glow
and
then
i
must
scrub
and
bake
and
sweep
till
stars
are
beginning
to
blink
and
peep
and
the
young
lie
long
and
dream
in
their
bed
of
the
matching
of
ribbons
for
bosom
and
head
and
their
day
goes
over
in
idleness
and
they
sigh
if
the
wind
but
lift
a
tress
while
i
must
work
because
i
am
old
and
the
seed
of
the
fire

cold

cousin

passed
my
brother
and
cousin
they
read
in
their
books
of
prayer
i
read
in
my
book
of
songs
i
bought
at
the
sligo
fair
when
we
come
at
the
end
of
time
to
peter

smile
on

first
through
the
gate

the
good

by
an
evil
chance

the
merry
love

merry
love

there

and
dance
like
a
wave

the
sea
the
heart
of
the
woman
o
what
to
me
the
little
room
that
was
brimmed
up
with
prayer
and
rest
he
bade
me
out
into
the
gloom
and
my
breast
lies
upon
his
breast
o
what
to
me
my
mother
care
the
house
where
i
was
safe
and
warm
the
shadowy
blossom
of
my
hair
will
hide
us
from
the
bitter
storm
o
hiding
hair
and
dewy
eyes
i
am
no
more
with
life
and
death
my
heart
upon
his
warm
heart
lies
my
breath
is
mixed
into
his
breath
aedh
laments
the
loss
of
love
pale
brows
still
hands
and
dim
hair
i
had
a
beautiful
friend
and
dreamed
that
the
old
despair
would
end
in
love
in
the
end
she
looked
in
my
heart
one
day
and
saw
your
image
was
there
she
has
gone
weeping
away
mongan
laments
the
change
that
has
come
upon
him
and
his
beloved
do
you
not
hear
me
calling
white
deer
with
no
horns
i
have
been
changed
to
a
hound
with
one
red
ear
i
have
been
in
the
path
of
stones
and
the
wood
of
thorns
for
somebody
hid
hatred
and
hope
and
desire
and
fear
under
my
feet
that
they
follow
you
night
and
day
a
man
with
a
hazel
wand
came
without
sound
he
changed
me
suddenly
i
was
looking
another
way
and
now
my
calling
is
but
the
calling
of
a
hound
and
time
and
birth
and
change
are
hurrying
by
i
would
that
the
boar
without
bristles
had
come
from
the
west
and
had
rooted
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
out
of
the
sky
and
lay
in
the
darkness
grunting
and
turning
to
his
rest
michael
robartes
bids
his
beloved
be
at
peace
i
hear
the
shadowy
horses
their
long
manes
their
hoofs
heavy
with
tumult
their
eyes
glimmering
white
the
north
unfolds
above
them
clinging
creeping
night
the
east
her
hidden
joy
before
the
morning
break
the
west
weeps
in
pale
dew
and
sighs
passing
away
the
south
is
pouring
down
roses
of
crimson
fire
o
vanity
of
sleep
hope
dream
endless
desire
the
horses
of
disaster
plunge
in
the
heavy
clay
beloved
let
your
eyes
half
close
and
your
heart
beat
over
my
heart
and
your
hair
fall
over
my
breast
drowning
love
lonely
hour
in
deep
twilight
of
rest
and
hiding
their
tossing
manes
and
their
tumultuous
feet
hanrahan
reproves
the
curlew
o
curlew
cry
no
more
in
the
air
or
only
to
the
waters
in
the
west
because
your
crying
brings
to
my
mind
eyes
and
long
heavy
hair
that
was
shaken
out
over
my
breast
there
is
enough
evil
in
the
crying
of
wind
michael
robartes
remembers
forgotten
beauty
when
my
arms
wrap
you
round
i
press
my
heart
upon
the
loveliness
that
has
long
faded
from
the
world
the
jewelled
crowns
that
kings
have
hurled
in
shadowy
pools
when
armies
fled
the
wove
with
silken
thread
by
dreaming
ladies
upon
cloth
that
has
made
fat
the
murderous
moth
the
roses
that
of
old
time
were
woven
by
ladies
in
their
hair
the
lilies
ladies
bore
through
many
a
sacred
corridor
where
such
gray
clouds
of
incense
rose
that
only
the
gods
eyes
did
not
close
for
that
pale
breast
and
lingering
hand
come
from
a
more
land
a
more
hour
than
this
and
when
you
sigh
from
kiss
to
kiss
i
hear
white
beauty
sighing
too
for
hours
when
all
must
fade
like
dew
but
flame
on
flame
deep
under
deep
throne
over
throne
where
in
half
sleep
their
swords
upon
their
iron
knees
brood
her
high
lonely
mysteries
a
poet
to
his
beloved
i
bring
you
with
reverent
hands
the
books
of
my
numberless
dreams
white
woman
that
passion
has
worn
as
the
tide
wears
the
sands
and
with
heart
more
old
than
the
horn
that
is
brimmed
from
the
pale
fire
of
time
white
woman
with
numberless
dreams
i
bring
you
my
passionate
rhyme
aedh
gives
his
beloved
certain
rhymes
fasten
your
hair
with
a
golden
pin
and
bind
up
every
wandering
tress
i
bade
my
heart
build
these
poor
rhymes
it
worked
at
them
day
out
day
in
building
a
sorrowful
loveliness
out
of
the
battles
of
old
times
you
need
but
lift
a
hand
and
bind
up
your
long
hair
and
sigh
and
all
men
hearts
must
burn
and
beat
and
foam
on
the
dim
sand
and
stars
climbing
the
sky
live
but
to
light
your
passing
feet
to
my
heart
bidding
it
have
no
fear
be
you
still
be
you
still
trembling
heart
remember
the
wisdom
out
of
the
old
days
who
trembles
before
the
flame
and
the
flood
and
the
winds
that
blow
through
the
starry
ways
let
the
starry
winds
and
the
flame
and
the
flood
cover
over
and
hide
for
he
has
no
part
with
the
proud
majestical
the
cap
and
bells
the
jester
walked
in
the
garden
the
garden
had
fallen
still
he
bade
his
soul
rise
upward
and
stand
on
her
it
rose
in
a
straight
blue
garment
when
owls
began
to
call
it
had
grown
by
thinking
of
a
quiet
and
light
footfall
but
the
young
queen
would
not
listen
she
rose
in
her
pale
night
gown
she
drew
in
the
heavy
casement
and
pushed
the
latches
down
he
bade
his
heart
go
to
her
when
the
owls
called
out
no
more
in
a
red
and
quivering
garment
it
sang
to
her
through
the
door
it
had
grown
by
dreaming
of
a
flutter
of
hair
but
she
took
up
her
fan
from
the
table
and
waved
it
off
on
the
air
have
cap
and
bells
he
pondered
will
send
them
to
her
and
die
and
when
the
morning
whitened
he
left
them
where
she
went
by
she
laid
them
upon
her
bosom
under
a
cloud
of
her
hair
and
her
red
lips
sang
them
a
love
song
till
stars
grew
out
of
the
air
she
opened
her
door
and
her
window
and
the
heart
and
the
soul
came
through
to
her
right
hand
came
the
red
one
to
her
left
hand
came
the
blue
they
set
up
a
noise
like
crickets
a
chattering
wise
and
sweet
and
her
hair
was
a
folded
flower
and
the
quiet
of
love
in
her
feet
the
valley
of
the
black
pig
the
dews
drop
slowly
and
dreams
gather
unknown
spears
suddenly
hurtle
before
my
eyes
and
then
the
clash
of
fallen
horsemen
and
the
cries
of
unknown
perishing
armies
beat
about
my
ears
we
who
still
labour
by
the
cromlec
on
the
shore
the
grey
cairn
on
the
hill
when
day
sinks
drowned
in
dew
being
weary
of
the
world
empires
bow
down
to
you
master
of
the
still
stars
and
of
the
flaming
door
michael
robartes
asks
forgiveness
because
of
his
many
moods
if
this

that
in

flicker
and

crumple
the
rose
in
your

and
cover
your

with

and

of

elder
than
changing
of

and

with

for

longing
for

the
odorous
twilight
there
aedh
tells
of
a
valley
full
of
lovers
i
dreamed
that
i
stood
in
a
valley
and
amid
sighs
for
happy
lovers
passed
two
by
two
where
i
stood
and
i
dreamed
my
lost
love
came
stealthily
out
of
the
wood
with
her
eyelids
falling
on
eyes
i
cried
in
my
dream
women
bid
the
young
men
lay
heads
on
your
knees
and
drown
their
eyes
with
your
hair
remembering
hers
they
will
find
no
other
face
fair
all
the
valleys
of
the
world
have
been
withered
aedh
tells
of
the
perfect
beauty
o
eyelids
eyes
the
poets
labouring
all
their
days
to
build
a
perfect
beauty
in
rhyme
are
overthrown
by
a
woman
gaze
and
by
the
unlabouring
brood
of
the
skies
and
therefore
my
heart
will
bow
when
dew
is
dropping
sleep
until
god
burn
time
before
the
unlabouring
stars
and
you
aedh
hears
the
cry
of
the
sedge
i
wander
by
the
edge
of
this
desolate
lake
where
wind
cries
in
the
sedge
the
axle
break
that
keeps
the
stars
in
their
round
and
hands
hurl
in
the
deep
the
banners
of
east
and
west
and
the
girdle
of
light
is
unbound
your
breast
will
not
lie
by
the
breast
of
your
beloved
in
aedh
thinks
of
those
who
have
spoken
evil
of
his
beloved
half
close
your
eyelids
loosen
your
hair
and
dream
about
the
great
and
their
pride
they
have
spoken
against
you
everywhere
but
weigh
this
song
with
the
great
and
their
pride
i
made
it
out
of
a
mouthful
of
air
their
children
children
shall
say
they
have
lied
the
blessed
cumhal
called
out
bending
his
head
till
dathi
came
and
stood
with
a
blink
in
his
eyes
at
the
cave
mouth
between
the
wind
and
the
wood
and
cumhal
said
bending
his

to
pray
when
you
pray
can
bring
you
salmon
out

out
of

but
dathi
folded
his
hands
and
smiled
with
the
secrets
of
god
in
his
eyes
and
cumhal
saw
like
a
drifting
smoke
all
manner
of
blessed
souls
women
and

young
men
with
books
and
old
men
with
croziers

these
that
with
golden
thuribles
singing
about
the
wood

are
blinking
dathi
said
the
secrets
of

half
blind
i
can

where
the

goes
when

blessedness
comes
in
the
night
and
the
day
whither
the
wise
heart
knows

has
seen
in
the
redness
of

incorruptible
rose
drowsily
drops
faint

on
him
the
sweetness
of

and
the

twilights
of

and
of
fire
the
secret
rose
far
off
most
secret
and
inviolate
rose
enfold
me
in
my
hour
of
hours
where
those
who
sought
thee
in
the
holy
sepulchre
or
in
the
wine
vat
dwell
beyond
the
stir
and
tumult
of
defeated
dreams
and
deep
among
pale
eyelids
heavy
with
the
sleep
men
have
named
beauty
thy
great
leaves
enfold
the
ancient
beards
the
helms
of
ruby
and
gold
of
the
crowned
magi
and
the
king
whose
eyes
saw
the
pierced
hands
and
rood
of
elder
rise
in
druid
vapour
and
make
the
torches
dim
till
vain
frenzy
awoke
and
he
died
and
him
who
met
fand
walking
among
flaming
dew
by
a
gray
shore
where
the
wind
never
blew
and
lost
the
world
and
emer
for

him
who
drove
the

out
of
their
liss
and
till
a
hundred
morns
had
flowered

feasted
and
wept
the
barrows

king
who
flung
the
crown

sorrow
away
and
calling
bard

clown
dwelt
among
wanderers
in
deep
woods
and
him
who
sold
tillage
and

goods
and
sought
through
lands
and
islands
numberless
years
until
he
found
with
laughter
and
with
tears

woman
of
so
shining
loveliness
that
men
threshed
corn
at
midnight
by
a

too
await
the

shall
the

be
blown
about

like
the

blown
out

his

were

were
you
but
lying
cold
and
dead
and
lights
were
paling
out
of
the
west
you
would
come
hither
and
bend
your
head
and
i
would
lay
my
head
on
your
breast
and
you
would
murmur
tender
words
forgiving
me
because
you
were
dead
nor
would
you
rise
and
hasten
away
though
you
have
the
will
of
the
wild
birds
but
know
your
hair
was
bound
and
wound
about
the
stars
and
moon
and
sun
o
would
beloved
that
you
lay
under
the
in
the
ground
while
lights
were
paling

by
one
aedh
wishes
for
the
cloths
of
heaven
had
i
the
heavens
embroidered
cloths
enwrought
with
golden
and
silver
light
the
blue
and
the
dim
and
the
dark
cloths
of
night
and
light
and
the
half
light
i
would
spread
the
cloths
under
your
feet
but
i
being
poor
have
only
my
dreams
i
have
spread
my
dreams
under
your
feet
tread
softly
because
you
tread
on
my
dreams
mongan
thinks
of
his
past
greatness
i
have
drunk
ale
from
the
country
of
the
young
and
weep
because
i
know
all
things
now
i
have
been
a
hazel
tree
and
they
hung
the
pilot
star
and
the
crooked
plough
among
my
leaves
in
times
out
of
mind
i
became
a
rush
that
horses
tread
i
became
a
man
a
hater
of
the
wind
knowing
one
out
of
all
things
alone
that
his
head
would
not
lie
on
the
breast
or
his
lips
on
the
hair
of
the
woman
that
he
loves
until
he
dies
although
the
rushes
and
the
fowl
of
the
air
cry
of
his
love
with
their
pitiful
cries
notes
the
hosting
of
the
sidhe
the
powerful
and
wealthy
called
the
gods
of
ancient
ireland
the
tuatha
de
danaan
or
the
tribes
of
the
goddess
danu
but
the
poor
called
them
and
still
sometimes
call
them
the
sidhe
from
aes
sidhe
or
sluagh
sidhe
the
people
of
the
faery
hills
as
these
words
are
usually
explained
sidhe
is
also
gaelic
for
wind
and
certainly
the
sidhe
have
much
to
do
with
the
wind
they
journey
in
whirling
winds
the
winds
that
were
called
the
dance
of
the
daughters
of
herodias
in
the
middle
ages
herodias
doubtless
taking
the
place
of
some
old
goddess
when
the
country
people
see
the
leaves
whirling
on
the
road
they
bless
themselves
because
they
believe
the
sidhe
to
be
passing
by
they
are
almost
always
said
to
wear
no
covering
upon
their
heads
and
to
let
their
hair
stream
out
and
the
great
among
them
for
they
have
great
and
simple
go
much
upon
horseback
if
any
one
becomes
too
much
interested
in
them
and
sees
them
over
much
he
loses
all
interest
in
ordinary
things
i
shall
write
a
great
deal
elsewhere
about
such
enchanted
persons
and
can
give
but
an
example
or
two
now
a
woman
near
gort
in
galway
says
is
a
boy
now
of
the
cloran
but
i
would
for
the
world
let
them
think
i
spoke
of
him
it
two
years
since
he
came
from
america
and
since
that
time
he
never
went
to
mass
or
to
church
or
to
fairs
or
to
market
or
to
stand
on
the
cross
roads
or
to
hurling
or
to
nothing
and
if
any
one
comes
into
the
house
it
into
the
room
he
slip
not
to
see
them
and
as
to
work
he
has
the
garden
dug
to
bits
and
the
whole
place
smeared
with
cow
dung
and
such
a
crop
as
was
never
seen
and
the
alders
all
plaited
till
they
look
grand
one
day
he
went
as
far
as
the
chapel
but
as
soon
as
he
got
to
the
door
he
turned
straight
round
again
as
if
he
power
to
pass
it
i
wonder
he
would
get
the
priest
to
read
a
mass
for
him
or
something
but
the
crop
he
has
is
grand
and
you
may
know
well
he
has
some
to
help
him
one
hears
many
stories
of
the
kind
and
a
man
whose
son
is
believed
to
go
out
riding
among
them
at
night
tells
me
that
he
is
careless
about
everything
and
lies
in
bed
until
it
is
late
in
the
day
a
doctor
believes
this
boy
to
be
mad
those
that
are
at
times
as
it
is
called
know
all
things
but
are
afraid
to
speak
a
countryman
at
kiltartan
says
was
one
of
the
lydons
john
was
away
for
seven
years
lying
in
his
bed
but
brought
away
at
nights
and
he
knew
everything
and
one
kearney
up
in
the
mountains
a
cousin
of
his
own
lost
two
hoggets
and
came
and
told
him
and
he
knew
the
very
spot
where
they
were
and
told
him
and
he
got
them
back
again
but
were
vexed
at
that
and
took
away
the
power
so
that
he
never
knew
anything
again
no
more
than
another
this
wisdom
is
the
wisdom
of
the
fools
of
the
celtic
stories
that
was
above
all
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
lomna
the
fool
of
fiann
had
so
great
wisdom
that
his
head
cut
from
his
body
was
still
able
to
sing
and
prophesy
and
a
writer
in
the
britannica
writes
that
tristram
in
the
oldest
form
of
the
tale
of
tristram
and
iseult
drank
wisdom
and
madness
the
shadow
of
wisdom
and
not
love
out
of
the
magic
cup
the
great
of
the
old
times
are
among
the
tribes
of
danu
and
are
kings
and
queens
among
them
caolte
was
a
companion
of
fiann
and
years
after
his
death
he
appeared
to
a
king
in
a
forest
and
was
a
flaming
man
that
he
might
lead
him
in
the
darkness
when
the
king
asked
him
who
he
was
he
said
am
your
candlestick
i
do
not
remember
where
i
have
read
this
story
and
i
have
maybe
half
forgotten
it
niam
was
a
beautiful
woman
of
the
tribes
of
danu
that
led
oisin
to
the
country
of
the
young
as
their
country
is
called
i
have
written
about
her
in
wandering
of
usheen
and
he
came
back
at
last
to
bitterness
and
weariness
knocknarea
is
in
sligo
and
the
country
people
say
that
maeve
still
a
great
queen
of
the
western
sidhe
is
buried
in
the
cairn
of
stones
upon
it
i
have
written
of
in
celtic
twilight
she
all
over
the
world
seeking
a
lake
deep
enough
to
drown
her
faery
life
of
which
she
had
grown
weary
leaping
from
hill
to
hill
and
setting
up
a
cairn
of
stones
wherever
her
feet
lighted
until
at
last
she
found
the
deepest
water
in
the
world
in
little
lough
ia
on
the
top
of
the
bird
mountain
in
sligo
i
forget
now
where
i
heard
this
story
but
it
may
have
been
from
a
priest
at
collooney
would
mean
the
old
woman
of
bare
but
is
evidently
a
corruption
of
cailleac
bare
the
old
woman
bare
who
under
the
names
bare
and
berah
and
beri
and
verah
and
dera
and
dhira
appears
in
the
legends
of
many
places
found
her
haunting
lough
liath
high
up
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
of
the
fews
the
slieve
fuadh
or
slieve
of
old
times
under
the
name
of
the
cailleac
buillia
he
describes
lough
liath
as
a
desolate
lake
with
made
wells
and
sunken
passages
upon
its
borders
and
beset
by
marsh
and
heather
and
gray
boulders
and
closes
his
of
the
eagle
with
a
long
rhapsody
upon
mountain
and
lake
because
of
the
heroic
tales
and
beautiful
old
myths
that
have
hung
about
them
always
he
identifies
the
cailleac
buillia
with
that
meluchra
who
persuaded
fionn
to
go
to
her
amid
the
waters
of
lough
liath
and
so
changed
him
with
her
enchantments
that
though
she
had
to
free
him
because
of
the
threats
of
the
fiana
his
hair
was
ever
afterwards
as
white
as
snow
to
this
day

is
now
often
called
an
ugly
old
woman
but
joyce
says
that
one
of
her
old
names
was
aebhin
which
means
beautiful
aebhen
was
the
goddess
of
the
tribes
of
northern
leinster
and
the
lover
she
had
made
immortal
and
who
loved
her
perfectly
left
her
and
put
on
mortality
to
fight
among
them
against
the
stranger
and
died
on
the
strand
of
clontarf
and
robartes
in
these
poems
these
are
personages
in
secret
rose
but
with
the
exception
of
some
of
hanrahan
and
one
of
aedh
poems
the
poems
are
not
out
of
that
book
i
have
used
them
in
this
book
more
as
principles
of
the
mind
than
as
actual
personages
it
is
probable
that
only
students
of
the
magical
tradition
will
understand
me
when
i
say
that
is
fire
reflected
in
water
and
that
hanrahan
is
fire
blown
by
the
wind
and
that
aedh
whose
name
is
not
merely
the
irish
form
of
hugh
but
the
irish
for
fire
is
fire
burning
by
itself
to
put
it
in
a
different
way
hanrahan
is
the
simplicity
of
an
imagination
too
changeable
to
gather
permanent
possessions
or
the
adoration
of
the
shepherds
and
michael
robartes
is
the
pride
of
the
imagination
brooding
upon
the
greatness
of
its
possessions
or
the
adoration
of
the
magi
while
aedh
is
the
myrrh
and
frankincense
that
the
imagination
offers
continually
before
all
that
it
loves
aedh
pleads
with
the
elemental
powers
mongan
thinks
of
his
past
greatness
aedh
hears
the
cry
of
the
sedge
the
rose
has
been
for
many
centuries
a
symbol
of
spiritual
love
and
supreme
beauty
the
count
goblet
thinks
that
it
was
once
a
symbol
of
the
sun
itself
a
principal
symbol
of
the
divine
nature
and
the
symbolic
heart
of
things
the
lotus
was
in
some
eastern
countries
imagined
blossoming
upon
the
tree
of
life
as
the
flower
of
life
and
is
thus
represented
in
assyrian
because
the
rose
the
flower
sacred
to
the
virgin
mary
and
the
flower
that
apuleius
adventurer
ate
when
he
was
changed
out
of
the
ass
shape
and
received
into
the
fellowship
of
isis
is
the
western
flower
of
life
i
have
imagined
it
growing
upon
the
tree
of
life
i
once
stood
beside
a
man
in
ireland
when
he
saw
it
growing
there
in
a
vision
that
seemed
to
have
rapt
him
out
of
his
body
he
saw
the
garden
of
eden
walled
about
and
on
the
top
of
a
high
mountain
as
in
certain
mediæval
diagrams
and
after
passing
the
tree
of
knowledge
on
which
grew
fruit
full
of
troubled
faces
and
through
whose
branches
flowed
he
was
told
sap
that
was
human
souls
he
came
to
a
tall
dark
tree
with
little
bitter
fruits
and
was
shown
a
kind
of
stair
or
ladder
going
up
through
the
tree
and
told
to
go
up
and
near
the
top
of
the
tree
a
beautiful
woman
like
the
goddess
of
life
associated
with
the
tree
in
assyria
gave
him
a
rose
that
seemed
to
have
been
growing
upon
the
tree
one
finds
the
rose
in
the
irish
poets
sometimes
as
a
religious
symbol
as
in
the
phrase
rose
of
friday
meaning
the
rose
of
austerity
in
a
gaelic
poem
in
songs
of
connacht
and
i
think
as
a
symbol
of
beauty
in
the
gaelic
song
dubh
and
a
symbol
of
ireland
in
mangan
adaptation
of
dubh
dark
rosaleen
and
in
aubrey
de
vere
little
black
rose
i
do
not
know
any
evidence
to
prove
whether
this
symbol
came
to
ireland
with
mediæval
christianity
or
whether
it
has
come
down
from
celtic
times
i
have
read
somewhere
that
a
stone
engraved
with
a
celtic
god
who
holds
what
looks
like
a
rose
in
one
hand
has
been
found
somewhere
in
england
but
i
can
not
find
the
reference
though
i
certainly
made
a
note
of
it
if
the
rose
was
really
a
symbol
of
ireland
among
the
gaelic
poets
and
if
dubh
is
really
a
political
poem
as
some
think
one
may
feel
pretty
certain
that
the
ancient
celts
associated
the
rose
with
eire
or
fotla
or
banba
goddesses
who
gave
their
names
to
ireland
or
with
some
principal
god
or
goddess
for
such
symbols
are
not
suddenly
adopted
or
invented
but
come
out
of
mythology
i
have
made
the
seven
lights
the
constellation
of
the
bear
lament
for
the
theft
of
the
rose
and
i
have
made
the
dragon
the
constellation
draco
the
guardian
of
the
rose
because
these
constellations
move
about
the
pole
of
the
heavens
the
ancient
tree
of
life
in
many
countries
and
are
often
associated
with
the
tree
of
life
in
mythology
it
is
this
tree
of
life
that
i
have
put
into
the
of
mongan
under
its
common
irish
form
of
a
hazel
and
because
it
had
sometimes
the
stars
for
fruit
i
have
hung
upon
it
crooked
plough
and
the
star
as
irishmen
sometimes
call
the
bear
and
the
north
star
i
have
made
it
an
in
hears
the
cry
of
the
sedge
for
this
was
another
ancient
way
of
representing
it
the
host
of
the
air
some
writers
distinguish
between
the
sluagh
gaoith
the
host
of
the
air
and
sluagh
sidhe
the
host
of
the
sidhe
and
describe
the
host
of
the
air
as
of
a
peculiar
malignancy
joyce
says
all
the
different
kinds
of
goblins
air
demons
were
most
dreaded
by
the
people
they
lived
among
clouds
and
mists
and
rocks
and
hated
the
human
race
with
the
utmost
malignity
a
very
old
arann
charm
which
contains
the
words
god
by
his
strength
between
us
and
the
host
of
the
sidhe
between
us
and
the
host
of
the
air
seems
also
to
distinguish
among
them
i
am
inclined
however
to
think
that
the
distinction
came
in
with
christianity
and
its
belief
about
the
prince
of
the
air
for
the
host
of
the
sidhe
as
i
have
already
explained
are
closely
associated
with
the
wind
they
are
said
to
steal
brides
just
after
their
marriage
and
sometimes
in
a
blast
of
wind
a
man
in
galway
says
aughanish
there
were
two
couples
came
to
the
shore
to
be
married
and
one
of
the
newly
married
women
was
in
the
boat
with
the
priest
and
they
going
back
to
the
island
and
a
sudden
blast
of
wind
came
and
the
priest
said
some
blessed
words
that
were
able
to
save
himself
but
the
girl
was
swept
this
woman
was
drowned
but
more
often
the
persons
who
are
taken
the
touch
as
it
is
called
and
fall
into
a
half
dream
and
grow
indifferent
to
all
things
for
their
true
life
has
gone
out
of
the
world
and
is
among
the
hills
and
the
forts
of
the
sidhe
a
faery
doctor
has
told
me
that
his
wife
the
touch
at
her
marriage
because
there
was
one
of
them
wanted
her
and
the
way
he
knew
for
certain
was
that
when
he
took
a
pitchfork
out
of
the
rafters
and
told
her
it
was
a
broom
she
said
is
a
broom
she
was
the
truth
is
in
the
magical
sleep
to
which
people
have
given
a
new
name
lately
that
makes
the
imagination
so
passive
that
it
can
be
moulded
by
any
voice
in
any
world
into
any
shape
a
mere
likeness
of
some
old
woman
or
even
old
animal
some
one
or
some
thing
the
sidhe
have
no
longer
a
use
for
is
believed
to
be
left
instead
of
the
person
who
is
this
some
one
or
some
thing
can
it
is
thought
be
driven
away
by
threats
or
by
violence
though
i
have
heard
country
women
say
that
violence
is
wrong
which
perhaps
awakes
the
soul
out
of
the
magical
sleep
the
story
in
the
poem
is
founded
on
an
old
gaelic
ballad
that
was
sung
and
translated
for
me
by
a
woman
at
ballisodare
in
county
sligo
but
in
the
ballad
the
husband
found
the
keeners
keening
his
wife
when
he
got
to
his
house
she
was
at
once
but
the
sidhe
are
said
to
value
those
the
most
whom
they
but
cast
into
a
half
dream
which
may
last
for
years
for
they
need
the
help
of
a
living
person
in
most
of
the
things
they
do
there
are
many
stories
of
people
who
seem
to
die
and
be
buried
though
the
country
people
will
tell
you
it
is
but
some
one
or
some
thing
put
in
their
place
that
dies
and
is
buried
and
yet
are
brought
back
afterwards
these
tales
are
perhaps
memories
of
true
awakenings
out
of
the
magical
sleep
moulded
by
the
imagination
under
the
influence
of
a
mystical
doctrine
which
it
understands
too
literally
into
the
shape
of
some
traditional
tale
one
does
not
hear
them
as
one
hears
the
others
from
the
persons
who
are
or
from
their
wives
or
husbands
and
one
old
man
who
had
often
seen
the
sidhe
began
one
of
them
with
it
is
all
vanity
here
is
a
tale
that
a
friend
of
mine
heard
in
the
burren
hills
and
it
is
a
type
of
all
was
a
girl
to
be
married
and
she
did
like
the
man
and
she
cried
when
the
day
was
coming
and
said
she
would
go
along
with
him
and
the
mother
said
get
into
the
bed
then
and
i
say
that
sick
and
so
she
did
and
when
the
man
came
the
mother
said
to
him
you
ca
get
her
she
sick
in
the
bed
and
he
looked
in
and
said
that
not
my
wife
that
in
the
bed
it
some
old
hag
and
the
mother
began
to
cry
and
to
roar
and
he
went
out
and
got
two
hampers
of
turf
and
made
a
fire
that
they
thought
he
was
going
to
burn
the
house
down
and
when
the
fire
was
kindled
come
out
now
says
he
and
see
who
you
are
when
i
put
you
on
the
fire
and
when
she
heard
that
she
gave
one
leap
and
was
out
of
the
house
and
they
saw
then
it
was
an
old
hag
she
was
well
the
man
asked
the
advice
of
an
old
woman
and
she
bid
him
go
to
a
that
was
near
and
he
might
get
some
word
of
her
so
he
went
there
at
night
and
saw
all
sorts
of
grand
people
and
they
in
carriages
or
riding
on
horses
and
among
them
he
could
see
the
girl
he
came
to
look
for
so
he
went
again
to
the
old
woman
and
she
said
if
you
can
get
the
three
bits
of
blackthorn
out
of
her
hair
you
get
her
again
so
that
night
he
went
again
and
that
time
he
only
got
hold
of
a
bit
of
her
hair
but
the
old
woman
told
him
that
was
no
use
and
that
he
was
put
back
now
and
it
might
be
twelve
nights
before
he
get
her
but
on
the
fourth
night
he
got
the
third
bit
of
blackthorn
and
he
took
her
and
she
came
away
with
him
he
never
told
the
mother
he
had
got
her
but
one
day
she
saw
her
at
a
fair
and
says
she
that
my
daughter
i
know
her
by
the
smile
and
by
the
laugh
of
her
and
she
with
a
shawl
about
her
head
so
the
husband
said
you
right
there
and
hard
i
worked
to
get
her
she
spoke
often
of
the
grand
things
she
saw
underground
and
how
she
used
to
have
wine
to
drink
and
to
drive
out
in
a
carriage
with
four
horses
every
night
and
she
used
to
be
able
to
see
her
husband
when
he
came
to
look
for
her
and
she
was
greatly
afraid
he
get
a
drop
of
the
wine
for
then
he
would
have
come
underground
and
never
left
it
again
and
she
was
glad
herself
to
come
to
earth
again
and
not
to
be
left
there
the
old
gaelic
literature
is
full
of
the
appeals
of
the
tribes
of
the
goddess
danu
to
mortals
whom
they
would
bring
into
their
country
but
the
song
of
midher
to
the
beautiful
etain
the
wife
of
the
king
who
was
called
echaid
the
ploughman
is
the
type
of
all
beautiful
woman
come
with
me
to
the
marvellous
land
where
one
listens
to
a
sweet
music
where
one
has
spring
flowers
in
one
hair
where
the
body
is
like
snow
from
head
to
foot
where
no
one
is
sad
or
silent
where
teeth
are
white
and
eyebrows
are
black
cheeks
red
like
foxglove
in
flower
ireland
is
beautiful
but
not
so
beautiful
as
the
great
plain
i
call
you
to
the
beer
of
ireland
is
heady
but
the
beer
of
the
great
plain
is
much
more
heady
how
marvellous
is
the
country
i
am
speaking
of
youth
does
not
grow
old
there
streams
with
warm
flood
flow
there
sometimes
mead
sometimes
wine
men
are
charming
and
without
a
blot
there
and
love
is
not
forbidden
there
o
woman
when
you
come
into
my
powerful
country
you
will
wear
a
crown
of
gold
upon
your
head
i
will
give
you
the
flesh
of
swine
and
you
will
have
beer
and
milk
to
drink
o
beautiful
woman
o
beautiful
woman
come
with
me
a
cradle
song
michael
robartes
asks
forgiveness
because
of
his
many
moods
i
use
the
wind
as
a
symbol
of
vague
desires
and
hopes
not
merely
because
the
sidhe
are
in
the
wind
or
because
the
wind
bloweth
as
it
listeth
but
because
wind
and
spirit
and
vague
desire
have
been
associated
everywhere
a
highland
scholar
tells
me
that
his
country
people
use
the
wind
in
their
talk
and
in
their
proverbs
as
i
use
it
in
my
poem
the
song
of
wandering
aengus
the
tribes
of
the
goddess
danu
can
take
all
shapes
and
those
that
are
in
the
waters
take
often
the
shape
of
fish
a
woman
of
burren
in
galway
says
are
more
of
them
in
the
sea
than
on
the
land
and
they
sometimes
try
to
come
over
the
side
of
the
boat
in
the
form
of
fishes
for
they
can
take
their
choice
shape
at
other
times
they
are
beautiful
women
and
another
galway
woman
says
those
things
are
in
the
sea
as
well
as
on
land
my
father
was
out
fishing
one
night
off
tyrone
and
something
came
beside
the
boat
that
had
eyes
shining
like
candles
and
then
a
wave
came
in
and
a
storm
rose
all
in
a
minute
and
whatever
was
in
the
wave
the
weight
of
it
had
like
to
sink
the
boat
and
then
they
saw
that
it
was
a
woman
in
the
sea
that
had
the
shining
eyes
so
my
father
went
to
the
priest
and
he
bid
him
always
to
take
a
drop
of
holy
water
and
a
pinch
of
salt
out
in
the
boat
with
him
and
nothing
could
harm
him
the
poem
was
suggested
to
me
by
a
greek
folk
song
but
the
folk
belief
of
greece
is
very
like
that
of
ireland
and
i
certainly
thought
when
i
wrote
it
of
ireland
and
of
the
spirits
that
are
in
ireland
an
old
man
who
was
cutting
a
quickset
hedge
near
gort
in
galway
said
only
the
other
day
time
i
was
cutting
timber
over
in
inchy
and
about
eight
one
morning
when
i
got
there
i
saw
a
girl
picking
nuts
with
her
hair
hanging
down
over
her
shoulders
brown
hair
and
she
had
a
good
clean
face
and
she
was
tall
and
nothing
on
her
head
and
her
dress
no
way
gaudy
but
simple
and
when
she
felt
me
coming
she
gathered
herself
up
and
was
gone
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
her
up
and
i
followed
her
and
looked
for
her
but
i
never
could
see
her
again
from
that
day
to
this
never
again
the
county
galway
people
use
the
word
in
its
old
sense
of
fresh
and
comely
michael
robartes
bids
his
beloved
be
at
peace
november
the
old
beginning
of
winter
or
of
the
victory
of
the
fomor
or
powers
of
death
and
dismay
and
cold
and
darkness
is
associated
by
the
irish
people
with
the
púcas
who
are
now
mischievous
spirits
but
were
once
fomorian
divinities
i
think
that
they
may
have
some
connection
with
the
horses
of
mannannan
who
reigned
over
the
country
of
the
dead
where
the
fomorian
tethra
reigned
also
and
the
horses
of
mannannan
though
they
could
cross
the
land
as
easily
as
the
sea
are
constantly
associated
with
the
waves
some
i
forget
who
describes
the
sea
as
a
symbol
of
the
drifting
indefinite
bitterness
of
life
and
i
believe
there
is
like
symbolism
intended
in
the
many
irish
voyages
to
the
islands
of
enchantment
or
that
there
was
at
any
rate
in
the
mythology
out
of
which
these
stories
have
been
shaped
i
follow
much
irish
and
other
mythology
and
the
magical
tradition
in
associating
the
north
with
night
and
sleep
and
the
east
the
place
of
sunrise
with
hope
and
the
south
the
place
of
the
sun
when
at
its
height
with
passion
and
desire
and
the
west
the
place
of
sunset
with
fading
and
dreaming
things
mongan
laments
the
change
that
has
come
upon
him
and
his
beloved
hanrahan
laments
because
of
his
wanderings
my
deer
and
hound
are
properly
related
to
the
deer
and
hound
that
flicker
in
and
out
of
the
various
tellings
of
the
arthurian
legends
leading
different
knights
upon
adventures
and
to
the
hounds
and
to
the
hornless
deer
at
the
beginning
of
i
think
all
tellings
of
journey
to
the
country
of
the
young
the
hound
is
certainly
related
to
the
hounds
of
annwvyn
or
of
hades
who
are
white
and
have
red
ears
and
were
heard
and
are
perhaps
still
heard
by
welsh
peasants
following
some
flying
thing
in
the
night
winds
and
is
probably
related
to
the
hounds
that
irish
country
people
believe
will
awake
and
seize
the
souls
of
the
dead
if
you
lament
them
too
loudly
or
too
soon
and
to
the
hound
the
son
of
setanta
killed
on
what
was
certainly
in
the
first
form
of
the
tale
a
visit
to
the
celtic
hades
an
old
woman
told
a
friend
and
myself
that
she
saw
what
she
thought
were
white
birds
flying
over
an
enchanted
place
but
found
when
she
got
near
that
they
had
heads
and
i
do
not
doubt
that
my
hound
and
these
birds
are
of
the
same
family
i
got
my
hound
and
deer
out
of
a
last
century
gaelic
poem
about
oisin
journey
to
the
country
of
the
young
after
the
hunting
of
the
hornless
deer
that
leads
him
to
the
seashore
and
while
he
is
riding
over
the
sea
with
niam
he
sees
amid
the
waters
i
have
not
the
gaelic
poem
by
me
and
describe
it
from
memory
a
young
man
following
a
girl
who
has
a
golden
apple
and
afterwards
a
hound
with
one
red
ear
following
a
deer
with
no
horns
this
hound
and
this
deer
seem
plain
images
of
the
desire
of
man
is
for
the
woman
and
desire
of
the
woman
which
is
for
the
desire
of
the
man
and
of
all
desires
that
are
as
these
i
have
read
them
in
this
way
in
wanderings
of
usheen
or
oisin
and
have
made
my
lover
sigh
because
he
has
seen
in
their
faces
immortal
desire
of
immortals
a
solar
mythologist
would
perhaps
say
that
the
girl
with
the
golden
apple
was
once
the
winter
or
night
carrying
the
sun
away
and
the
deer
without
horns
like
the
boar
without
bristles
darkness
flying
the
light
he
would
certainly
i
think
say
that
when
cuchullain
whom
professor
rhys
calls
a
solar
hero
hunted
the
enchanted
deer
of
slieve
fuadh
because
the
battle
fury
was
still
on
him
he
was
the
sun
pursuing
clouds
or
cold
or
darkness
i
have
understood
them
in
this
sense
in
laments
because
of
his
wandering
and
made
hanrahan
long
for
the
day
when
they
fragments
of
ancestral
darkness
will
overthrow
the
world
the
desire
of
the
woman
the
flying
darkness
it
is
all
one
the
image
a
cross
a
man
preaching
in
the
wilderness
a
dancing
salome
a
lily
in
a
girl
hand
a
flame
leaping
a
globe
with
wings
a
pale
sunset
over
still
waters
is
an
eternal
act
but
our
understandings
are
temporal
and
understand
but
a
little
at
a
time
the
man
in
my
poem
who
has
a
hazel
wand
may
have
been
aengus
master
of
love
and
i
have
made
the
boar
without
bristles
come
out
of
the
west
because
the
place
of
sunset
was
in
ireland
as
in
other
countries
a
place
of
symbolic
darkness
and
death
the
cap
and
bells
i
dreamed
this
story
exactly
as
i
have
written
it
and
dreamed
another
long
dream
after
it
trying
to
make
out
its
meaning
and
whether
i
was
to
write
it
in
prose
or
verse
the
first
dream
was
more
a
vision
than
a
dream
for
it
was
beautiful
and
coherent
and
gave
me
the
sense
of
illumination
and
exaltation
that
one
gets
from
visions
while
the
second
dream
was
confused
and
meaningless
the
poem
has
always
meant
a
great
deal
to
me
though
as
is
the
way
with
symbolic
poems
it
has
not
always
meant
quite
the
same
thing
blake
would
have
said
authors
are
in
eternity
and
i
am
quite
sure
they
can
only
be
questioned
in
dreams
the
valley
of
the
black
pig
all
over
ireland
there
are
prophecies
of
the
coming
rout
of
the
enemies
of
ireland
in
a
certain
valley
of
the
black
pig
and
these
prophecies
are
no
doubt
now
as
they
were
in
the
fenian
days
a
political
force
i
have
heard
of
one
man
who
would
not
give
any
money
to
the
land
league
because
the
battle
could
not
be
until
the
close
of
the
century
but
as
a
rule
periods
of
trouble
bring
prophecies
of
its
near
coming
a
few
years
before
my
time
an
old
man
who
lived
at
lisadell
in
sligo
used
to
fall
down
in
a
fit
and
rave
out
descriptions
of
the
battle
and
a
man
in
sligo
has
told
me
that
it
will
be
so
great
a
battle
that
the
horses
shall
go
up
to
their
fetlocks
in
blood
and
that
their
girths
when
it
is
over
will
rot
from
their
bellies
for
lack
of
a
hand
to
unbuckle
them
the
battle
is
a
mythological
battle
and
the
black
pig
is
one
with
the
bristleless
boar
that
killed
dearmod
in
november
upon
the
western
end
of
ben
bulben
misroide
macdatha
sow
whose
carving
brought
on
so
great
a
battle

pages
the
boar
that
killed
adonis
the
boar
that
killed
attis
and
the
pig
embodiment
of
typhon
bough
ii
pages
the
pig
seems
to
have
been
originally
a
genius
of
the
corn
and
seemingly
because
the
too
great
power
of
their
divinity
makes
divine
things
dangerous
to
mortals
its
flesh
was
forbidden
to
many
eastern
nations
but
as
the
meaning
of
the
prohibition
was
forgotten
abhorrence
took
the
place
of
reverence
pigs
and
boars
grew
into
types
of
evil
and
were
described
as
the
enemies
of
the
very
gods
they
once
typified
bough
ii
the
pig
would
therefore
become
the
black
pig
a
type
of
cold
and
of
winter
that
awake
in
november
the
old
beginning
of
winter
to
do
battle
with
the
summer
and
with
the
fruit
and
leaves
and
finally
as
i
suggest
and
as
i
believe
for
the
purposes
of
poetry
of
the
darkness
that
will
at
last
destroy
the
gods
and
the
world
the
country
people
say
there
is
no
shape
for
a
spirit
to
take
so
dangerous
as
the
shape
of
a
pig
and
a
galway
blacksmith
and
blacksmiths
are
thought
to
be
especially
protected
says
he
would
be
afraid
to
meet
a
pig
on
the
road
at
night
and
another
galway
man
tells
this
story
was
a
man
coming
the
road
from
gort
to
garryland
one
night
and
he
had
a
drop
taken
and
before
him
on
the
road
he
saw
a
pig
walking
and
having
a
drop
in
he
gave
a
shout
and
made
a
kick
at
it
and
bid
it
get
out
of
that
and
by
the
time
he
got
home
his
arm
was
swelled
from
the
shoulder
to
be
as
big
as
a
bag
and
he
could
use
his
hand
with
the
pain
of
it
and
his
wife
brought
him
after
a
few
days
to
a
woman
that
used
to
do
cures
at
rahasane
and
on
the
road
all
she
could
do
would
hardly
keep
him
from
lying
down
to
sleep
on
the
grass
and
when
they
got
to
the
woman
she
knew
all
that
happened
and
says
she
it
well
for
you
that
your
wife
did
let
you
fall
asleep
on
the
grass
for
if
you
had
done
that
but
even
for
one
instant
you
be
a
lost
man
it
is
possible
that
bristles
were
associated
with
fertility
as
the
tail
certainly
was
for
a
pig
tail
is
stuck
into
the
ground
in
courland
that
the
corn
may
grow
abundantly
and
the
tails
of
pigs
and
other
animal
embodiments
of
the
corn
genius
are
dragged
over
the
ground
to
make
it
fertile
in
different
countries
professor
rhys
who
considers
the
bristleless
boar
a
symbol
of
darkness
and
cold
rather
than
of
winter
and
cold
thinks
it
was
without
bristles
because
the
darkness
is
shorn
away
by
the
sun
it
may
have
had
different
meanings
just
as
the
scourging
of
the
has
had
different
though
not
contradictory
meanings
in
different
epochs
of
the
world
the
battle
should
i
believe
be
compared
with
three
other
battles
a
battle
the
sidhe
are
said
to
fight
when
a
person
is
being
taken
away
by
them
a
battle
they
are
said
to
fight
in
november
for
the
harvest
the
great
battle
the
tribes
of
the
goddess
danu
fought
according
to
the
gaelic
chroniclers
with
the
fomor
at
moy
tura
or
the
towery
plain
i
have
heard
of
the
battle
over
the
dying
both
in
county
galway
and
in
the
isles
of
arann
an
old
arann
fisherman
having
told
me
that
it
was
fought
over
two
of
his
children
and
that
he
found
blood
in
a
box
he
had
for
keeping
fish
when
it
was
over
and
i
have
written
about
it
and
given
examples
elsewhere
a
faery
doctor
on
the
borders
of
galway
and
clare
explained
it
as
a
battle
between
the
friends
and
enemies
of
the
dying
the
one
party
trying
to
take
them
the
other
trying
to
save
them
from
being
taken
it
may
once
when
the
land
of
the
sidhe
was
the
only
other
world
and
when
every
man
who
died
was
carried
thither
have
always
accompanied
death
i
suggest
that
the
battle
between
the
tribes
of
the
goddess
danu
the
powers
of
light
and
warmth
and
fruitfulness
and
goodness
and
the
fomor
the
powers
of
darkness
and
cold
and
barrenness
and
badness
upon
the
towery
plain
was
the
establishment
of
the
habitable
world
the
rout
of
the
ancestral
darkness
that
the
battle
among
the
sidhe
for
the
harvest
is
the
annual
battle
of
summer
and
winter
that
the
battle
among
the
sidhe
at
a
man
death
is
the
battle
of
life
and
death
and
that
the
battle
of
the
black
pig
is
the
battle
between
the
manifest
world
and
the
ancestral
darkness
at
the
end
of
all
things
and
that
all
these
battles
are
one
the
battle
of
all
things
with
shadowy
decay
once
a
symbolism
has
possessed
the
imagination
of
large
numbers
of
men
it
becomes
as
i
believe
an
embodiment
of
disembodied
powers
and
repeats
itself
in
dreams
and
visions
age
after
age
the
secret
rose
i
find
that
i
have
unintentionally
changed
the
old
story
of
death
he
did
not
see
the
crucifixion
in
a
vision
but
was
told
about
it
he
had
been
struck
by
a
ball
made
of
the
dried
brain
of
a
dead
enemy
and
hurled
out
of
a
sling
and
this
ball
had
been
left
in
his
head
and
his
head
had
been
mended
the
book
of
leinster
says
with
thread
of
gold
because
his
hair
was
like
gold
keating
a
writer
of
the
time
of
elizabeth
says
that
state
did
he
remain
seven
years
until
the
friday
on
which
christ
was
crucified
according
to
some
historians
and
when
he
saw
the
unusual
changes
of
the
creation
and
the
eclipse
of
the
sun
and
the
moon
at
its
full
he
asked
of
bucrach
a
leinster
druid
who
was
along
with
him
what
was
it
that
brought
that
unusual
change
upon
the
planets
of
heaven
and
earth
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
said
the
druid
who
is
now
being
crucified
by
the
jews
that
is
a
pity
said
conchobar
were
i
in
his
presence
i
would
kill
those
who
were
putting
him
to
death
and
with
that
he
brought
out
his
sword
and
rushed
at
a
woody
grove
which
was
convenient
to
him
and
began
to
cut
and
fell
it
and
what
he
said
was
that
if
he
were
among
the
jews
that
was
the
usage
he
would
give
them
and
from
the
excessiveness
of
his
fury
which
seized
upon
him
the
ball
started
out
of
his
head
and
some
of
the
brain
came
after
it
and
in
that
way
he
died
the
wood
of
lanshraigh
in
feara
rois
is
the
name
by
which
that
shrubby
wood
is
called
i
have
imagined
cuchullain
meeting
fand
among
flaming
dew
the
story
of
their
love
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
our
old
tales
two
birds
bound
one
to
another
with
a
chain
of
gold
came
to
a
lake
side
where
cuchullain
and
the
host
of
uladh
was
encamped
and
sang
so
sweetly
that
all
the
host
fell
into
a
magic
sleep
presently
they
took
the
shape
of
two
beautiful
women
and
cast
a
magical
weakness
upon
cuchullain
in
which
he
lay
for
a
year
at
the
year
end
an
aengus
who
was
probably
aengus
the
master
of
love
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
children
of
the
goddess
danu
came
and
sat
upon
his
bedside
and
sang
how
fand
the
wife
of
mannannan
the
master
of
the
sea
and
of
the
islands
of
the
dead
loved
him
and
that
if
he
would
come
into
the
country
of
the
gods
where
there
was
wine
and
gold
and
silver
fand
and
laban
her
sister
would
heal
him
of
his
magical
weakness
cuchullain
went
to
the
country
of
the
gods
and
after
being
for
a
month
the
lover
of
fand
made
her
a
promise
to
meet
her
at
a
place
called
yew
at
the
strand
end
and
came
back
to
the
earth
emer
his
mortal
wife
won
his
love
again
and
mannannan
came
to
yew
at
the
strand
end
and
carried
fand
away
when
cuchullain
saw
her
going
his
love
for
her
fell
upon
him
again
and
he
went
mad
and
wandered
among
the
mountains
without
food
or
drink
until
he
was
at
last
cured
by
a
druid
drink
of
forgetfulness
i
have
founded
the

out
of
their

fort
upon
something
i
have
read
about
caolte
after
the
battle
of
gabra
when
almost
all
his
companions
were
killed
driving
the
gods
out
of
their
liss
either
at
osraighe
now
ossory
or
at
eas
ruaidh
now
asseroe
a
waterfall
at
ballyshannon
where
ilbreac
one
of
the
children
of
the
goddess
danu
had
a
liss
i
am
writing
away
from
most
of
my
books
and
have
not
been
able
to
find
the
passage
but
i
certainly
read
it
somewhere
i
have
founded
proud
dreaming
king
upon
fergus
the
son
of
roigh
the
legendary
poet
of
quest
of
the
bull
of
cualge
as
he
is
in
the
ancient
story
of
deirdre
and
in
modern
poems
by
ferguson
he
married
nessa
and
ferguson
makes
him
tell
how
she
took
him
in
a
single
look
am
but
an
empty
shade
far
from
life
and
passion
laid
yet
does
sweet
remembrance
thrill
all
my
shadowy
being
still
presently
because
of
his
great
love
he
gave
up
his
throne
to
conchobar
her
son
by
another
and
lived
out
his
days
feasting
and
fighting
and
hunting
his
promise
never
to
refuse
a
feast
from
a
certain
comrade
and
the
mischief
that
came
by
his
promise
and
the
vengeance
he
took
afterwards
are
a
principal
theme
of
the
poets
i
have
explained
my
imagination
of
him
in
and
the
druid
and
in
a
little
song
in
the
second
act
of
countess
kathleen
i
have
founded
him
sold
tillage
and
house
and
goods
upon
something
in
red
pony
a
folk
tale
in
larminie
irish
folk
tales
a
young
man
a
light
before
him
on
the
high
road
when
he
came
as
far
there
was
an
open
box
on
the
road
and
a
light
coming
up
out
of
it
he
took
up
the
box
there
was
a
lock
of
hair
in
it
presently
he
had
to
go
to
become
the
servant
of
a
king
for
his
living
there
were
eleven
boys
when
they
were
going
out
into
the
stable
at
ten
each
of
them
took
a
light
but
he
he
took
no
candle
at
all
with
him
each
of
them
went
into
his
own
stable
when
he
went
into
his
stable
he
opened
the
box
he
left
it
in
a
hole
in
the
wall
the
light
was
great
it
was
twice
as
much
as
in
the
other
stables
the
king
hears
of
it
and
makes
him
show
him
the
box
the
king
says
must
go
and
bring
me
the
woman
to
whom
the
hair
belongs
in
the
end
the
young
man
and
not
the
king
marries
the
woman
