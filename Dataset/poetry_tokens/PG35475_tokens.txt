the
mothering
hustlin
in
my
jeans
the
homesteader
vain
suitors
god
signalman
going
home
just
be
glad
the
canadian
rockies
a
prairie
heroine
the
seer
the
son
of
marquis
noddle
the
prodigals
the
squad
of
one
alkali
hall
prairie
born
a
colonial
little
tim
trotter
the
vortex
the
old
guard
kid
mccann
who
owns
the
land
a
race
for
life
the
prairie
the
city
oh
yes
the
city
is
a
good
enough
place
for
a
while
it
fawns
on
the
clever
and
witty
and
welcomes
the
rich
with
a
smile
it
lavishes
money
as
water
it
boasts
of
its
palace
and
hall
but
the
city
is
only
the
daughter
the
prairie
is
mother
of
all
the
city
is
all
artificial
its
life
is
a
fraud
its
wisdom
though
learned
and
judicial
is
far
from
the
wisdom
of
god
its
hope
is
the
hope
of
ambition
its
lust
is
the
lust
to
acquire
and
the
larger
it
grows
its
condition
sinks
lower
in
pestilent
mire
the
city
is
cramped
and
congested
the
haunt
and
the
covert
of
crime
the
prairie
is
broad
unmolested
it
points
to
the
high
and
sublime
where
only
the
sky
is
above
you
and
only
the
distance
in
view
with
no
one
to
jostle
or
shove
you
it
there
a
man
learns
to
be
true
where
the
breeze
whispers
over
the
willows
or
sighs
in
the
dew
laden
grass
and
the
rain
clouds
like
big
stormy
billows
besprinkle
the
land
as
they
pass
with
the
alight
in
the
distance
the
wild
duck
alert
on
the
stream
where
life
is
a
psalm
of
existence
and
opulence
only
a
dream
where
wide
as
the
plan
of
creation
the
prairies
stretch
ever
away
and
beckon
a
broad
invitation
to
fly
to
their
bosom
and
stay
the
prairie
fire
smell
in
the
gloaming
the
wind
in
the
spring
an
empire
untrod
for
the
roaming
ah
this
is
a
life
for
a
king
when
peaceful
and
pure
as
a
river
they
lie
in
the
light
of
the
moon
you
know
that
the
infinite
giver
is
stringing
your
spirit
that
life
is
not
told
in
the
telling
that
death
does
not
whisper
adieu
and
deep
in
your
bosom
you
know
that
the
promise
is
true
to
those
who
have
seen
it
and
smelt
it
to
those
who
have
loved
it
alone
to
those
who
have
known
it
and
felt
it
the
prairie
is
ever
their
own
and
far
though
they
wander
unwary
far
far
from
the
breath
of
the
plain
a
thought
of
the
wind
on
the
prairie
will
set
their
blood
rushing
again
then
you
to
the
city
who
want
it
go
grovel
its
streets
be
one
of
the
ciphers
that
haunt
it
or
sit
in
its
opulent
seats
but
for
me
where
the
prairies
are
reaching
as
far
as
the
vision
can
scan
ah
that
is
the
prayer
and
the
preaching
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
a
man
the
gramophone
where
the
lonely
settler
shanty
dots
the
plain
and
he
sighs
for
friends
and
comradeship
in
vain
through
the
silences
intense
comes
a
sound
of
eloquence
shrilling
forth
in
steely
brazen
waxen
strain
the
deep
resonant
voice
of
gladstone
calling
from
the
tomb
or
ingersoll
deliverance
before
his
brother
bier
then
a
saucy
someone
singing
when
the
daisies
are
in
bloom
and
the
fife
and
drummers
rendering
the
british
grenadier
back
as
far
into
the
hills
as
they
could
get
they
a
roof
that
turns
the
winter
and
the
wet
they
are
grizzled
but
they
gay
they
a
daily
matinee
they
are
happy
though
they
head
and
ears
in
debt
i
wish
i
had
my
old
girl
back
again
if
the
wind
had
only
blown
the
other
way
uncertain
voices
join
an
old
refrain
and
repeat
the
same
performance
every
day
there
a
scotchman
holding
down
a
mining
claim
all
unknown
to
fortune
influence
or
fame
but
a
few
of
harry
songs
are
a
solace
for
his
wrongs
and
he
sings
them
evening
in
his
hame
i
courtin
bonnie
leezy
lindsay
noo
when
i
get
back
again
you
know
the
lilt
we
parted
on
the
shore
i
fou
i
fou
and
that
the
reason
noo
i
wear
the
kilt
there
a
son
of
erin
in
saskatchewan
he
at
work
a
half
an
hour
before
the
dawn
but
before
he
goes
to
bunk
he
makes
a
table
of
his
trunk
and
he
sets
his
concert
thereupon
the
harp
that
once
through
tara
halls
st
patrick
day
in
the
mornin
the
last
rose
of
summer
and
fancy
recalls
a
glimpse
of
his
kathleen
mavourneen
there
an
englishman
who
living
in
a
shack
he
a
victim
of
the
gramophone
attack
with
a
kids
he
has
half
that
many
quids
but
he
dances
with
the
youngest
on
his
back
though
he
living
in
the
country
of
the
cree
the
horn
that
hangs
a
fathom
from
his
head
stretches
out
a
thousand
leagues
across
the
sea
and
sings
in
dear
old
london
town
instead
they
are
far
from
auditorium
or
hall
but
their
minds
are
still
to
music
call
they
can
hear
caruso
sing
or
the
bells
of
shandon
ring
as
they
smoke
and
count
the
cracks
along
the
wall
a
miracle
of
eloquence
imprisoned
in
the
wax
i
a
mental
inspiration
operated
by
a
spring
i
a
nightly
consolation
from
yukon
to
halifax
and
the
ends
of
all
creation
sit
and
listen
while
i
sing
i
the
voice
of
all
that
man
has
sought
and
gained
i
the
throb
of
heart
that
ever
pained
i
the
genesis
of
fate
i
the
soul
of
love
and
hate
i
the
humanly
impossible
attained
the
plow
what
power
is
this
that
stands
behind
the
steel
a
homely
implement
of
blade
and
wheel
neglected
by
the
margin
of
the
way
and
flashing
back
the
blaze
of
dying
day
or
dragging
slow
across
the
yellow
field
in
silent
prophecy
of
lavish
yield
it
marks
the
pace
of
innocence
and
toil
and
taps
the
boundless
treasure
of
the
soil
before
you
came
the
red
man
rode
the
plain
untitled
lord
of
nature
great
domain
the
shaggy
herds
knee
deep
in
mellow
grass
the
lazy
summer
hours
were
wont
to
pass
the
wild
goose
nested
by
the
water
side
the
red
deer
roamed
upon
the
prairie
wide
the
black
bear
trod
the
woods
in
solemn
might
the
lynx
stole
through
the
bushes
in
the
night
no
sound
of
toil
was
heard
in
all
the
land
no
joyous
laugh
of
voice
or
sharp
command
no
cloud
of
smoke
from
iron
funnels
thrown
was
through
the
autumn
hazes
gently
blown
no
edge
of
steel
tore
up
the
virgin
sod
no
church
its
shining
finger
turned
to
god
no
tradesman
labored
over
bench
and
tool
no
children
chattered
on
their
way
to
school
but
all
the
land
lay
desolate
and
bare
its
wealth
of
plain
its
forest
riches
rare
unguessed
by
those
who
saw
it
through
their
tears
and
nature
miser
of
a
thousand
years
was
adding
still
to
her
immense
reserve
that
shall
supply
the
world
with
brawn
and
nerve
but
all
lay
silent
useless
and
unused
and
useless
was
because
it
was
unused
you
came
straightway
the
silent
plain
grew
mellow
with
the
glow
of
golden
grain
the
axes
in
the
solitary
wood
rang
out
where
stately
oak
and
maple
stood
the
land
became
alive
with
busy
din
and
as
the
many
settled
more
came
in
the
world
looked
on
in
wonder
and
dismay
the
building
of
a
nation
in
a
day
by
lake
and
river
rock
and
barren
waste
a
peaceful
army
toiled
in
eager
haste
ten
thousand
workers
sweating
in
the
sun
pressed
on
the
task
so
recently
begun
their
outworks
every
day
were
forced
ahead
and
every
day
they
gave
their
toll
of
dead
until
at
length
the
double
lines
of
steel
received
the
steaming
steed
and
whirling
wheel
where
yesterday
the
lazy
bison
lay
a
city
glitters
in
the
sun
his
paths
are
turned
to
streets
of
wood
and
stone
and
thousands
tread
the
way
he
trod
alone
the
mighty
hum
of
industry
and
trade
fills
all
the
place
where
once
he
held
parade
and
far
away
the
unheard
river
play
makes
joyous
night
still
brighter
than
the
day
upon
the
plains
a
thousand
towns
arise
and
quickly
each
to
be
a
city
tries
the
sound
of
trade
is
heard
on
every
hand
and
sturdy
men
rise
to
possess
the
land
awhile
they
lingered
thinking
it
a
dream
but
now
they
flow
in
a
resistless
stream
that
seems
to
fill
the
prairie
far
and
near
yet
in
its
vastness
soon
they
disappear
where
once
the
silent
red
man
spurned
the
ground
a
land
of
peace
and
plenty
now
is
found
a
land
by
nature
destined
to
be
great
where
every
man
is
lord
of
his
estate
where
men
may
dwell
together
in
accord
and
honest
toil
receive
its
due
reward
where
loyal
friends
and
happy
homes
are
made
and
culture
follows
hard
the
feet
of
trade
this
you
have
made
it
is
it
vain
to
hope
the
sons
of
such
a
land
will
climb
and
grope
along
the
undiscovered
ways
of
life
and
neither
seek
nor
be
found
shunning
strife
but
ever
beckoned
by
a
high
ideal
press
onward
upward
till
they
make
it
real
with
feet
sure
planted
on
their
native
sod
and
will
and
aspirations
linked
with
god
the
mothering
i
had
lain
untrod
for
a
million
years
from
the
line
to
the
arctic
sea
i
had
dreamed
strange
dreams
of
the
vast
unknown
of
the
lisping
wind
and
the
dancing
zone
where
the
northland
fairies
feet
had
flown
and
it
all
seemed
good
to
me
at
the
close
of
a
thousand
eons
of
sleep
came
a
pang
that
was
strange
to
me
the
pang
of
a
new
life
in
my
breast
the
swell
of
a
vast
and
a
vague
unrest
and
it
thrilled
my
soul
from
east
to
west
as
it
fluttered
to
be
free
but
i
steeled
my
heart
to
the
biped
thing
of
vast
presumption
he
he
would
lure
my
lonely
thoughts
away
he
would
sport
himself
on
the
sacred
clay
where
the
dust
of
the
prehistoric
lay
but
he
scorned
the
soul
of
me
so
i
stretched
my
plains
for
a
thousand
leagues
from
the
mountains
to
the
sea
but
he
rolled
them
back
with
a
line
and
he
crumbled
space
by
man
design
and
he
filled
his
life
with
the
breath
of
mine
but
his
love
he
gave
not
me
then
i
called
him
foes
from
the
farthest
north
and
the
snowflake
fluttered
free
but
he
took
him
trees
i
had
given
birth
and
he
delved
him
coal
from
my
bowels
of
earth
and
he
laughed
at
me
as
he
sat
in
mirth
but
he
cursed
the
cold
of
me
then
i
cut
him
off
from
his
that
his
thought
might
turn
to
me
but
he
strung
him
a
line
of
copper
thread
and
his
words
swung
overhead
by
the
fiend
of
air
his
thought
was
spread
hill
and
plain
and
lea
then
i
gave
him
hopes
he
could
not
define
and
fears
that
he
could
not
flee
and
he
heard
my
cry
in
the
long
still
night
in
my
i
held
him
tight
and
his
blind
craved
for
the
light
but
the
light
he
could
not
see
so
i
held
my
peace
till
i
saw
him
sit
with
children
at
his
knee
and
i
sent
them
the
sun
the
wind
and
the
rain
and
the
ferny
slope
and
the
flowery
plain
and
the
wet
of
the
growing
grain
and
their
love
they
gave
to
me
in
the
last
of
the
sons
of
men
a
travail
holdeth
me
but
out
of
the
night
of
pain
and
tears
a
new
life
comes
with
the
rolling
years
and
i
fondle
the
child
of
my
hope
and
fears
and
it
seemeth
good
to
me
hustlin
in
my
jeans
yes
i
holdin
down
the
homestead
here
an
roughin
it
a
bit
it
seems
the
only
kind
o
life
that
i
was
built
to
fit
for
it
thirty
years
last
summer
since
i
staked
my
first
preserve
an
i
reckon
on
the
whole
i
prospered
more
than
i
deserve
an
my
friends
kep
naggin
at
me
for
to
quit
this
toil
an
strife
an
to
settle
in
the
city
for
the
balance
of
my
life
an
i
ai
compelled
to
labor
i
cached
a
wad
of
beans
but
i
happier
when
i
hustlin
on
the
homestead
in
my
jeans
i
tried
to
loaf
an
like
it
an
i
tried
to
swell
about
where
the
boozey
run
to
an
the
greedy
run
to
gout
an
i
tried
to
wear
a
collar
an
a
fancy
vest
an
i
tried
to
think
it
pleasant
just
to
sit
around
an
rest
an
i
mingled
with
the
nabobs
an
with
other
guys
that
were
just
as
sick
as
i
was
of
a
life
of
livin
lies
i
mingled
in
society
an
peeked
behind
the
scenes
an
i
happier
when
i
hustlin
on
the
homestead
in
my
jeans
then
i
got
the
lust
for
roamin
an
i
rummaged
round
the
earth
an
i
got
a
big
experience
an
correspondin
girth
but
the
more
i
roved
an
rambled
the
less
i
cared
to
live
an
i
only
kep
on
goin
cause
i
no
alternative
i
learned
through
tips
an
tickets
an
the
jostle
of
the
cars
that
i
would
trade
a
homestead
for
a
continent
in
mars
an
i
bid
to
fashion
an
her
social
kings
an
queens
an
i
filed
my
second
homestead
an
i
bought
a
pair
of
jeans
it
sometimes
kind
o
lonely
on
the
prairie
here
alone
when
the
settles
round
you
an
your
thoughts
are
all
your
own
an
old
faces
flit
before
you
like
a
flock
o
homin
birds
an
your
heart
swells
with
emotion
that
no
man
can
put
in
words
an
you
ponder
on
the
the
beginnin
an
the
end
an
you
know
the
only
things
worth
while
are
family
an
friend
from
the
trifles
of
existence
your
better
judgment
weans
an
you
get
the
right
perspective
on
the
homestead
in
your
jeans
there
are
days
the
glisten
on
this
hand
of
mine
there
are
nights
the
joints
go
creakin
as
i
crawl
to
bed
at
nine
but
i
hear
the
horses
stampin
and
the
rap
of
collie
tail
an
it
minds
me
of
the
eighties
an
the
old
commission
trail
of
the
days
we
pledged
our
future
to
a
land
we
hardly
knew
an
the
men
whose
brave
beginnings
made
prosperity
for
you
there
are
men
now
worth
their
millions
i
remember
in
their
teens
an
they
made
their
start
by
hustlin
on
the
homestead
in
their
jeans
there
are
times
when
most
folks
figure
that
their
life
has
been
a
blank
you
may
be
a
homeless
hobo
or
director
of
a
bank
but
the
thought
will
catch
you
nappin
catch
you
sometime
unawares
that
your
life
has
been
a
failure
and
that
no
one
really
cares
that
the
world
will
roll
without
you
till
the
resurrection
morn
an
that
no
one
would
have
missed
you
if
you
never
had
been
born
an
i
give
you
my
conclusion
all
that
livin
really
means
is
revealed
to
those
who
hustle
on
the
homestead
in
their
jeans
some
day
i
reckon
i
cash
in
an
file
another
claim
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troublin
an
the
good
get
in
the
game
where
the
pews
are
not
allotted
by
the
fashion
of
your
dress
an
the
only
thing
that
figures
is
inherent
manliness
give
me
no
horses
an
no
hearse
but
let
some
student
preacher
read
a
bit
of
scripture
verse
an
find
a
sunny
hillside
where
the
screens
an
plant
me
on
the
homestead
where
i
hustled
in
my
jeans
the
homesteader
far
away
from
the
din
of
the
city
i
dwell
on
the
prairie
alone
with
no

or
to

all
the
broad
earth
for
my
own
the

to
allure
me
to
labor
the
shanty
to
shelter
my
sleep
a
league
and
a
half

a
neighbor
and
collie
to
watch

i
weep
yes
this
is
my
place
of
probation
though
woefully
windy
and
bare
i
am
lord
of
my
own
habitation
i
mock
at
the
meaning
of
care
for
here
on
the
edge
of
creation
lies
far
as
the
vision
can
fling
a
kingdom
that
fit
for
a
nation
a
kingdom
and
i
am
the
king
the
grasses
aglare
in
the
morning
with
crystalline
radiance

adorning
are
jewels
and
the
jewels
are
mine
the
heat
of
the
sun
when
it
shineth
the
wet
of
the
wind
when
it
rains
are
balm
to
the
heart
that
repineth
the
medicine
men
of
the
plains
i
follow
the
plow
in
the
breaking
i
tap
the
rich
treasures
of
time
the
treasure
is
here
for
the
taking
and
taking
it
is
a
crime
i
ride
on
the
rack
or
the
reaper
to
harvest
the
fruit
of
my
hand
and
daily
i
know
that
the
deeper
i
rooting
my
soul
in
the
land
they
say
there
is
wealth
in
the
doing
that
royal
and
rich
are
the
gains
but
is
the
wealth
i
am
wooing
so
much
as
the
life
of
the
plains
for
here
in
the
morning
where
time
to
eternity
clings
midwife
to
a
breed
in
the
borning
i
behold
the
beginnings
of
things
when
reckless
of
time
and
of
trouble
i
watch
till
the
water
fowl
comes
or
picking
my
steps
in
the
stubble
i
steal
where
the
prairie
hen
drums
when
shooting
the
wolf
in
the
brushes
or
spearing
the
pike
in
the
stream
or
potting
the
crane
in
the
rushes
ambition
seems
only
a
dream
when
darkness
envelops
creation
and
shadows
lie
deep
on
the
plain
i
sit
in
my
rude
habitation
and
ponder
my
childhood
again
then
voices
come
out
of
the
distance
far
voices
from
over
the
sea
they
call
from
the
depths
of
existence
i
know
they
are
calling
to
me
the
voices
of
song
and
of
motion
the
voices
of
laughter
and
light
they
calling
from
over
the
ocean
oh
god
could
i
answer
the
voices
of
friend
and
of
lover
the
voices
i
knew
in
the
past
i
turn
to
my
pallet
to
smother
the
thoughts
that
have
found
me
at
last
than
the
measure
of
the
heroes
of
renown
he
is
building
for
the
future
and
no
hand
can
hold
him
down
though
they
count
him
but
a
common
man
he
holds
the
outer
gate
and
posterity
will
own
him
as
the
father
of
the
vain
suitors
you
may
tell
in
fondest
phrases
how
venetian
glory
raises
sunlit
domes
and

streets

the

or

weave
a
web
of
sentiment
but
leave
a
little
sentiment
for
me
where
the
warm
atlantic
waters
lave
your
laughing
sons
and
daughters
by
a
hundred
sunny
cities
where
her
tides
flow
full
and

well
no
i
not
superstitious
at
least
i
do
call
it
that
but
when
someone
spins
a
creepy
yarn
i
do
deny
it
flat
for
a
man
who
spends
a
lifetime
with
the
throttle
in
his
hand
is
bound
to
have
adventures
that
he
can
not
understand
i
sometimes
think
our
knowledge
here
is
but
a
sorry
show
we
only
on
the
borderland
of
what
there
is
to
know
i
used
to
think
a
man
could
know
all
things
that
could
be
known
that
he
should
not
acknowledge
any
power
above
his
own
that
however
strange
the
circumstance
there
always
is
a
cause
that
is
in
complete
obedience
to
some
of
nature
laws
but
i
could
shake
conviction
off
no
matter
how
i
tried
and
i
changed
my
way
of
thinking
since
the
night
that
willie
died
yes
willie
was
my
little
son
my
greatest
earthly
joy
and
wife
and
i
just
kind
o
seemed
to
dote
upon
the
boy
when
i
was
out
on
duty
she
would
hover
round
the
lad
and
treasure
up
his
sayings
to
repeat
them
to
his
dad
and
every
night
at
lighting
time
i
knew
that
without
fail
his
baby
lips
were
praying
for
the
man
out
on
the
ah
well
for
three
short
years
we
knew
what
such
a
treasure
is
and
we
grew
ever
more
attached
to
those
sweet
ways
of
his
when
one
day
swinging
through
the
gate
i
saw
with
blanching
face
my
wife
as
pale
as
ashes
and
a
doctor
in
the
i
tried
to
go
in
steady
but
my
knees
were
knocking
hard
and
the
light
went
out
of
heaven
as
i
staggered
up
the
yard
the
doctor
was
a
friend
of
mine
with
children
of
his
own
but
he
did
need
to
tell
me
for
a
blind
man
would
have
known
by
the
labored
breathing
and
the
little
burning
brow
that
the
visitor
was
ready
and
was
waiting
for
him
now
we
sat
about
his
bedside
in
silent
deep
despair
and
the
years
rolled
down
upon
us
as
we
faced
each
other
there
was
a
little
before
midnight
when
a
ring
came
at
the
bell
and
the
said
excuse
me
sir
but
i
was
sent
to
tell
that
is
waiting
and
there
no
one
else
about
they
expecting
you
to
take
her
if
you
do
she
ca
go
out
i
left
the
answer
to
my
wife
with
lips
as
white
as
snow
she
whispered
do
your
duty
and
i
said
all
right
i
go
my
fireman
knew
my
trouble
and
in
way
he
let
me
know
his
heart
was
feeling
things
he
could
say
the
night
was
dark
and
moonless
but
the
bright
stars
overhead
seemed
to
whisper
to
each
other
his
little
boy
is
dead
the
very
locomotive
seemed
to
read
my
thoughts
aright
and
the
monster
sobbed
in
sympathy
as
we
bulleted
the
night
we
been
running
fast
and
steady
till
a
little
after
two
all
the
passengers
were
fast
asleep
except
perhaps
a
few
who
sat
stories
in
the
smoker
when
a
sight
met
my
eyes
that
fairly
froze
my
blood
in
terror
and
affright
for
there
before
me
standing
in
the
halo
of
the
light
was
a
little
child
outlined
against
the
blackness
of
the
night
oh
i
could
not
be
mistaken
i
would
know
him
anywhere
with
his
father
mouth
and
forehead
and
his
mother
eyes
and
hair
and
little
arms
outstretched
to
me
that
seemed
to
coax
and
say
come
daddy
come
and
kiss
me
for
i
going
far
away
i
flung
the
brake
and
throttle
and
amid
the
hissing
steam
the
vision
grew
and
waned
away
and
vanished
as
a
dream
my
fireman
was
beside
me
your
nerve
is
going
jack
let
leave
the
engine
here
and
take
a
walk
along
the
track
the
exercise
will
do
you
good
i
followed
as
he
led
until
we
reached
the
gorge
about
a
hundred
yards
ahead
the
night
wind
cooled
my
temples
as
we
walked
the
bridge
upon
till
we
sudden
stopped
with
a
sudden
gasp
the
centre
span
was
gone
you
may
call
it
hallucination
as
some
of
the
others
do
but
i
know
that
the
master
took
my
boy
that
night
at
two
and
the
prayers
of
a
hundred
passengers
had
been
offered
up
in
vain
had
his
spirit
clad
in
his
baby
dress
not
stood
before
my
i
know
i
cried
in
my
and
was
otherwise
but
the
life
that
i
lost
was
more
to
me
than
all
the
lives
he
saved
going
home
the
village
lights
grew
dim
behind
the
snow
lay
vast
and
white
and
silent
as
an
icy
shroud
spread
out
upon
the
night
a
wan
moon
struggled
with
the
clouds
and
through
the
misty
haze
the
trails
that
branched
to
left
and
right
were
tangled
as
a
maze
the
settler
horses
plodded
in
the
soft
uncertain
snow
and
stealing
cautiously
behind
a
thing
moved
to
and
fro
the
trail
was
little
travelled
and
the
pale
sad
sickly
light
was
hindrance
rather
than
a
help
to
read
the
road
aright
a
dozen
miles
lay
stretched
between
the
settler
and
his
shack
he
thought
of
many
things
that
night
not
once
of
turning
back
above
the
crunching
of
the
snow
he
heard
the
rising
wind
but
never
looked
and
never
saw
the
thing
that
stole
behind
the
trail
was
lost
the
horses
took
their
way
across
the
plain
the
settler
strove
to
hold
the
course
but
strove
alas
in
vain
the
fickle
wind
seemed
scarce
to
stay
a
moment
at
a
place
now
howling
in
a
real
attack
now
snapping
at
his
face
and
nearing
leering
peering
in
the
ghastly
ghostly
light
the
thing
came
softly
after
as
it
followed
in
the
night
a
light
a
light
a
welcome
light
gleamed
friendly
from
afar
oh
can
it
be
it
can
not
be
is
surely
not
a
star
nay
nay
it
is
more
warm
and
near
a
happy
farmer
home
that
beckons
to
the
wanderer
you
need
no
longer
roam
with
eager
hope
they
hastened
on
and
plied
across
the
plain
as
often
as
the
horses
fell
they
rose
to
plunge
again
the
hours
moved
on
the
miles
moved
on
they
followed
as
a
dream
the
waning
light
the
dying
light
of
that
deceitful
gleam
and
when
at
last
it
seemed
the
place
must
almost
be
in
sight
the
light
went
out
oh
perfidy
oh
murderous
mocking
light
was
well
the
ears
grew
deaf
before
the
howling
of
the
wind
nor
heard
the
ghoulish
chuckle
of
the
gloating
thing
behind
the
snow
lay
deep
the
horses
floundered
with
the
heavy
sleigh
till
plunging
in
a
sudden
drift
they
tore
the
tongue
away
the
sleepy
driver
knew
it
not
as
through
his
nerveless
hands
his
hold
on
life
was
slipping
with
the
frozen
leather
bands
the
night
was
calm
and
beautiful
the
frost
had
ceased
to
thing
had
lept
upon
him
and
was
tearing
at
his
heart
the
room
was
warm
and
cosy
and
the
light
was
soft
and
low
her
presence
seemed
to
radiate
a
tender
girlish
glow
and
when
she
placed
her
hand
in
his
the
soft
caressing
palm
was
cure
for
every
trouble
and
for
every
pain
a
balm
and
she
whispered
sweet
my
sweetheart
i
be
faithful
be
true
in
the
springtime
in
the
springtime
i
will
cross
the
sea
to
a
little
bed
was
fashioned
in
the
fitful
firelight
glow
a
little
boy
was
murmuring
a
prayer
of
long
ago
and
upon
his
head
that
fondled
in
his
hair
and
sense
of
quiet
comfort
and
respite
from
every
care
and
a
pillow
white
and
downy
and
a
bed
so
soft
and
deep
and
tired
lips
were
lisping
now
i
lay
me
down
to
again
the
scene
was
changed
a
flood
of
mellow
amber
light
that
filled
the
soul
with
ecstasy
of
infinite
delight
while
music
tinkled
through
the
yellow
glow
the
lullabies
of
childhood
and
the
songs
of
long
ago
the
sea
of
god
on
every
hand
in
silent
silver
lay
an
atom
fell
its
circles
spread
through
all
eternity
the
thing
was
gone
its
work
was
done
a
lump
of
lifeless
clay
sat
crouching
crouching
crouching
in
the
dawning
of
the
day
the
frozen
eyeballs
stared
upon
a
wilderness
of
snow
and
peered
into
the
future
to
the
place
no
man
may
know
a
prowled
about
the
spot
and
sniffed
below
the
sleigh
and
howled
a
melancholy
howl
and
slunk
in
fear
away
just
be
glad

of
all

the
canadian
rockies
suggested
in

camp

club

sherbrooke
lake
august
i
to
the
hills
will
lift
mine
eyes
of
old
the
psalmist
sung
and
we
who
clutch
the
worldly
prize
with
earth
distractions
wrung
still
turn
our
fevered
fancy
gaze
where
snowy
summits
greet
the
day
where
nature
guards
her
mysteries
and
time
becomes
eternity
where
changeless
in
eternal
change
the
rockies
clip
the
clouds
and
glacial
lakes
and
granite
range
sleep
in
their
snowy
shrouds
where
silence
hushes
discontent
and
petty
fears
are
lost
in
space
the
builder
of
the
firmament
still
meets
his
people
face
to
face
o
barren
cares
that
bitter
life
o
hopes
unwisely
dear
o
fruitless
fallacy
and
strife
o
social
sham
veneer
i
to
the
hills
will
lift
mine
eyes
where
mantling
cloud
or
cornice
clings
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
paradise
and
turn
again
to
little
things
a
prairie
heroine
they
were
running
out
the
they
were
staking
out
the
grade
through
the
hills
they
had
to
measure
through
the
sloughs
they
had
to
wade
they
were
piercing
unknown
regions
they
were
crossing
nameless
streams
with
the
prairie
for
a
pillow
and
the
sky
above
their
dreams
they
were
mapping
unborn
cities
in
the
pregnant
clay
when
they
came
upon
a
little
mound
across
the
there
were
violets
growing
on
it
and
a
buttercup
or
two
that
whispered
of
affection
ever
old
and
ever
new
and
a
little
ring
of
whitewashed
stones
bright
in
the
summer
sun
but
of
marble
slab
or
granite
pile
or
pillar
there
was
none
and
across
the
sleeping
prairie
lay
a
little
shack
with
a
garden
patch
before
it
and
a
wheat
field
at
its
back
well
boys
we
better
see
him
and
he
had
ought
to
kick
for
we
give
him
time
to
move
it
if
he
does
it
pretty
quick
but
scarcely
had
the
foreman
spoke
when
straight
across
the
farm
they
saw
the
settler
coming
with
a
rifle
on
his
arm
some
would
ha
hiked
for
cover
but
they
had
no
place
to
run
but
most
of
them
decided
they
would
stay
and
see
the
fun
the
farmer
was
the
first
to
speak
i
hate
to
interfere
and
mighty
glad
i
am
to
see
the
railway
comin
near
but
before
you
drive
your
pickets
across
this
piece
of
land
you
ought
to
hear
the
story
or
you
will
not
understand
it
the
story
of
a
girl
who
was
as
true
as
she
was
brave
and
all
that
now
remains
of
her
is
in
that
little
grave
i
did
want
to
bring
her
when
i
hit
the
trail
out
west
i
knew
i
should
do
it
and
i
did
my
level
best
to
coax
her
not
to
come
out
for
a
year
or
two
at
least
but
to
stay
and
take
it
easy
with
her
friends
down
in
the
east
but
while
i
coaxed
and
argued
i
was
feelin
mighty
glum
and
right
down
in
my
heart
i
kep
she
would
come
well
by
rail
and
boat
and
saddle
we
got
out
here
at
last
in
the
future
and
forgettin
of
the
past
we
built
ourselves
a
little
home
and
in
our
work
and
care
it
seemed
to
me
she
always
took
what
was
the
lion
share
god
knows
just
what
she
suffered
but
she
hid
it
with
a
smile
and
made
out
that
she
thought
i
was
the
only
thing
worth
while
she
stood
it
through
the
summer
and
the
warm
brown
days
of
fall
and
of
all
the
voices
calling
her
she
would
not
hear
the
call
but
when
the
winter
settled
with
its
cold
white
pall
of
snow
she
seemed
to
whiten
with
it
but
she
thought
i
did
know
she
tried
to
keep
her
spirits
up
and
laugh
my
fears
away
but
i
saw
her
growing
thin
and
ever
weaker
day
by
day
at
last
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
so
i
said
think
you
better
try
and
spend
a
day
or
two
in
bed
while
i
go
for
a
doctor
it
only
sixty
miles
she
gave
a
little
wistful
look
half
hidden
in
her
smiles
and
said
you
better
though
i
think
i
be
all
right
when
the
spring
well
i
started
out
that
night
i
made
the
trip
on
horseback
by
the
guiding
polar
star
and
a
dozen
times
the
distance
never
seemed
one
half
so
far
but
the
doctor
had
gone
out
of
town
just
where
no
one
could
say
and
a
lump
rose
in
my
chest
that
fairly
took
my
breath
away
but
i
dare
stay
there
thinking
and
my
search
for
him
was
vain
so
i
bought
some
wine
and
brandy
and
i
started
home
again
forgetful
of
my
horse
i
spent
the
whole
night
on
the
road
till
early
in
the
morning
he
collapsed
beneath
his
load
i
saw
the
brute
was
done
for
and
although
it
made
me
cry
i
hacked
into
his
vein
and
left
him
there
to
die
and
then
i
shouldered
the
supplies
and
staggered
on
alone
and
thinking
of
my
wife
distress
i
quite
forgot
my
own
she
must
ha
watched
all
night
for
me
for
in
the
morning
grey
she
saw
me
stagger
in
the
snow
and
fall
beside
the
way
and
god
knows
how
she
did
it
she
was
only
skin
and
bone
but
she
came
out
here
and
found
me
and
dragged
me
home
alone
and
she
took
the
precious
liquor
that
had
cost
us
all
so
dear
and
poured
it
down
this
worthless
hulk
that
standin
i
guess
you
know
what
happened
i
lived
she
passed
away
i
robed
her
in
her
and
laid
her
in
the
clay
and
every
spring
i
plant
the
flowers
that
grow
upon
her
grave
for
i
hold
the
spot
as
sacred
as
the
arimathæn
cave
and
when
the
winter
snows
have
come
and
all
is
white
and
still
i
spread
a
blanket
on
the
mound
to
keep
out
frost
and
chill
folks
say
i
got
a
screw
loose
that
i
gone
to
acting
queer
but
i
sometimes
hear
her
speaking
and
i
know
she
always
near
and
sometimes
in
the
night
i
feel
the
pressure
of
her
hand
and
for
a
blessed
hour
i
share
with
her
the
promised
land
let
man
or
devil
undertake
to
desecrate
my
dead
and
as
sure
as
god
in
heaven
i
will
pump
him
full
of
lead
they
were
railway
men
who
stood
about
the
spot
they
were
men
that
lied
and
gambled
they
were
men
that
drank
and
fought
but
some
of
them
were
sneezing
and
some
were
coughing
bad
and
some
were
blowing
noses
on
anything
they
had
and
some
of
them
were
swallowing
at
lumps
that
should
come
and
some
were
swearing
softly
and
some
were
simply
dumb
at
last
the
foreman
found
his
voice
i
guess
your
claim
is
sound
i
would
care
to
run
a
track
across
that
piece
of
we
have
to
change
our
but
i
hope
we
have
the
grace
to
build
a
fitting
monument
to
mark
that
holy
place
put
me
down
for
a
hundred
now
boys
how
much
for
you
and
they
answered
in
a
chorus
we
see
the
business
through
the
passengers
upon
a
certain
railway
the
plain
see
a
shining
shaft
of
marble
from
the
windows
of
the
train
but
they
do
not
know
the
story
of
the
in
the
snow
and
the
farmer
with
his
lonely
life
of
woe
and
none
of
them
have
guessed
that
the
deflection
in
the
line
is
the
railway
builders
tribute
to
a
prairie
heroine
the
seer
in
the
dingy
dust
of
his
deerskin
tent
sat
the
chief
of
a
dying
race
and
the
lake
that
lapt
at
his
wigwam
door
threw
back
a
frowning
face
and
a
sightless
squaw
at
the
crooned
low
in
a
hybrid
speech
when
a
man
of
god
swept
round
the
point
and
landed
on
the
beach
the
heavy
eyes
grew
bright
with
fire
the
lips
shaped
to
a
sneer
welcome
my
paleface
brother
what
good
news
brings
you
here
are
you
come
with
the
voice
of
healing
with
the
book
of
your
blameless
breed
to
soothe
my
soul
with
comfort
while
my
body
gnaws
with
need
welcome
o
paleface
brother
come
what
have
you
to
fear
mayhap
the
redskin
chieftain
can
teach
as
well
as
hear
and
while
we
sing
your
sacred
songs
and
breathe
your
mystic
prayer
who
knows
what
inspiration
may
come
on
the
air
listen
you
are
a
scholar
schooled
in
the
paleface
lore
is
said
a
dying
saint
may
sometimes
see
the
shining
shore
that
closing
eyes
peer
far
beyond
the
realm
of
mortal
sight
who
knows
but
that
a
dying
race
may
read
the
road
aright
a
dying
race
we
know
it
the
land
is
ours
no
more
no
more
we
roam
the
prairies
as
in
the
days
of
yore
the
brave
free
spirit
that
was
ours
is
crushed
and
passed
away
and
bodies
without
spirits
are
predestined
to
decay
no
matter
in
the
summertime
the
flowers
bloom
in
the
grass
the
startled
insects
flood
the
fields
and
chirrup
as
you
pass
the
birds
sing
in
the
bushes
but
before
the
wintry
blast
the
flowers
and
the
insects
and
the
little
birds
are
past
yet
once
again
the
spring
will
come
the
flowers
will
bloom
again
and
insects
chirrup
blithely
where
the
former
ones
are
lain
the
white
snows
of
the
wintertime
will
vanish
in
the
heat
and
life
and
color
will
follow
their
defeat
can
the
paleface
read
the
riddle
has
he
eyes
to
see
the
signs
or
thinketh
he
that
snow
will
lie
forever
on
the
pines
that
life
can
triumph
for
the
mastery
of
state
or
cushioned
chairs
produce
a
race
destined
to
dominate
behold
the
things
your
hands
have
done
the
power
your
arts
have
won
behold
those
things
shall
vanish
as
the
snow
before
the
sun
the
snow
that
smothered
out
the
red
ah
hear
it
if
you
can
shall
leave
the
earth
as
suddenly
leave
it
brown
and
hear
ye
a
little
lesson
surely
ye
know
its
worth
only
an
nation
can
be
master
of
the
earth
soon
as
ye
seek
your
couches
soft
with
the
spoils
of
trade
see
well
to
your
outer
trenches
before
the
mines
are
laid
hear
ye
a
little
lesson
can
ye
the
truth
divine
milk
ye
may
mix
with
water
and
water
will
mix
with
wine
mix
as
ye
may
on
your
prairies
mix
in
your
hope
and
toil
but
know
in
all
your
mixing
that
water
wo
mix
with
oil
in
the
dingy
dusk
of
his
deerskin
tent
sat
the
chief
of
a
dying
race
and
the
glow
of
holy
prophecy
lit
up
his
rugged
face
and
the
foremost
light
of
the
setting
sun
fell
far
on
an
eastern
land
who
shall
save
the
paleface
if
he
will
not
understand
the
son
of
marquis
noddle
he
is
out
from
england
and
he
thinks
he
knows
it
all
there
a
bloomin
bit
o
goggle
in
his
eye
the
colonial
that
crosses
him
is
going
to
get
a
fall
there
a
revolver
on
his
thigh
he
a
son
of
marquis
noddle
he
a
nephew
of
an
earl
in
the
social
swim
of
england
he
got
all
awhirl
he
as
confident
as
cæsar
and
as
pretty
as
a
girl
oh
he
out
in
deadly
earnest
do
or
die
they
will
spot
him
in
the
cities
by
the
cowhide
on
his
feet
they
were
built
for
crushing
cobblestones
at
and
the
giddy
girls
will
giggle
when
they
see
him
on
the
street
there
a
cowboy
hat
upon
his
dome
he
has
come
from
home
and
kindred
to
the
land
beyond
the
sea
to
the
land
of
plenty
to
the
country
of
the
free
but
he
ca
forget
he
owns
it
from
cape
race
to
behring
sea
he
is
coming
just
as
cæsar
would
to
rome
when
his
pile
is
getting
slender
he
go
looking
for
a
job
and
he
thinks
he
ought
to
get
it
but
he
finds
that
he
must
mingle
with
the
common
city
mob
how
they
think
that
he
would
stoop
so
low
so
he
hikes
him
to
the
country
where
the
rustics
will
be
proud
to
salute
him
when
they
meet
him
and
to
whisper
nice
and
loud
he
the
son
of
marquis
noddle
you
would
know
him
in
a
crowd
they
will
pay
him
there
the
homage
that
they
owe
in
the
little
country
village
he
will
manufacture
mirth
for
it
there
they
take
the
measure
of
a
swell
they
will
soon
proceed
to
teach
him
that
he
does
own
the
earth
with
a
on
the
sun
and
moon
as
well
they
will
show
him
that
the
country
is
altogether
slow
and
that
they
can
travel
any
pace
that
he
a
mind
to
go
he
will
be
a
right
good
fellow
till
they
run
him
out
of
dough
oh
it
is
a
tale
of
merriment
they
tell
so
to
keep
his
bones
together
he
goes
working
on
a
farm
where
they
get
up
at
a
little
after
two
where
they
think
to
take
him
down
a
peg
will
not
do
him
any
harm
and
they
sleep
when
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
where
they
work
him
like
a
nigger
nearly
twenty
hours
a
day
and
they
do
disguise
the
fact
that
they
consider
him
a
jay
and
he
eats
so
much
and
sleeps
so
much
he
is
worth
his
pay
oh
it
does
matter
that
his
blood
is
blue
he
decides
to
do
a
season
as
a
cowboy
in
the
west
where
they
call
a
man
a
boy
until
he
dead
and
he
tries
to
walk
with
a
military
chest
and
he
is
overslept
or
overfed
they
will
set
him
breaking
bronchos
though
it
little
to
his
mind
with
many
epithets
he
perforate
the
wind
how
can
he
know
the
boys
have
stuck
a
thistle
on
behind
he
will
end
the
exhibition
on
his
head
they
will
fill
him
full
of
liquor
that
frizzle
his
inside
in
the
cooler
he
can
square
it
with
his
god
he
will
spend
his
nights
in
places
where
the
reside
in
the
morning
he
be
minus
watch
and
wad
they
abuse
him
as
a
youngster
they
will
mock
him
as
a
man
they
make
his
life
a
thorny
path
in
every
way
they
can
till
he
curses
his
existence
and
the
day
that
it
began
and
he
wishes
he
was
rotting
in
the
sod
he
will
write
long
tales
to
england
tales
of
bitterness
and
woe
they
will
print
in
the
papers
over
there
he
will
tell
them
pretty
nearly
everything
he
does
know
and
they
take
it
all
for
gospel
over
there
he
will
tell
them
that
the
country
is
fit
for
gentlemen
that
any
who
escape
from
it
do
not
come
back
again
he
is
handy
with
his
language
and
he
wields
a
bitter
pen
to
the
truth
of
each
assertion
he
would
swear
he
a
growler
he
a
growser
he
a
nuisance
he
a
bum
and
the
country
has
any
room
for
such
and
they
class
him
in
the
papers
as
european
scum
they
would
rather
have
the
irish
or
the
dutch
he
the
butt
of
every
jester
he
the
mark
of
every
joke
he
is
wearing
borrowed
trousers
he
has
put
his
own
in
soak
he
a
useless
beaten
buffeted
and
broke
and
of
sympathy
he
wo
get
in
a
dozen
years
you
find
him
with
a
section
of
his
own
he
had
to
learn
his
lesson
at
the
start
with
a
happy
wife
and
children
he
is
trying
to
atone
for
he
loves
the
country
now
with
all
his
heart
he
a
son
of
dear
old
england
he
a
hero
he
a
brick
he
the
kind
you
may
annihilate
but
you
can
never
lick
for
he
played
and
lost
and
played
and
lost
and
stayed
and
took
the
trick
in
a
world
of
men
he
play
a
manly
part
the
prodigals
our
prairies
link
the
seas
our
voiceless
rivers
wend
we
hold
unturned
the
larder
keys
on
which
the
future
years
depend
and
shall
we
suffer
alien
throngs
usurp
the
land
to
us
belongs
what
though
we
are
to
fortune
born
and
all
our
paths
are
paved
with
gold
we
flaunt
our
folly
up
to
scorn
because
we
keep
not
what
we
hold
why
should
we
rob
our
right
of
birth
to
foster
all
the
breeds
of
earth
we
picture
with
unfeigned
dismay
lands
of
other
flags
they
multiply
but
to
decay
and
rot
in
pestilence
and
rags
why
hasten
we
to
emulate
these
helpless
tragedies
of
fate
the
land
our
children
sons
will
need
that
land
we
have
wide
open
thrown
to
heathen
knaves
of
other
breed
and
paunchy
pirates
of
our
own
we
give
away
earth
greatest
prize
and
pat
ourselves
and
call
us
wise
no
father
he
who
to
the
slums
for
husband
to
his
child
would
send
and
no
one
worthy
of
her
comes
she
lives
a
maiden
to
the
end
yet
we
have
placed
our
virgin
trust
in
spawn
of
continental
lust
if
dumb
we
be
to
reason
cries
our
children
cause
she
pleads
in
vain
our
outraged
sons
at
length
will
rise
and
seize
their
heritage
again
and
fools
who
prate
of
vested
right
will
either
cease
to
prate
or
fight
the
land
is
ours
the
land
will
keep
and
time
is
nowise
near
its
end
we
hold
our
birthright
all
too
cheap
its
sacredness
to
comprehend
in
after
years
our
sons
will
say
why
frittered
ye
the
land
away
the
squad
of
one
sergeant
blue
of
the
mounted
police
was
a
kind
of
a
guy
he
swore
a
bit
and
he
lied
a
bit
and
he
boozed
a
bit
on
the
sly
but
he
held
the
post
at
snake
creek
bend
for
country
and
home
and
god
and
he
cursed
the
first
and
forgot
the
rest
which
was
the
least
bit
odd
now
the
life
of
the
north
west
mounted
police
breeds
an
kind
of
man
a
man
who
can
jug
a
thug
when
he
rushes
the
can
a
man
who
can
pray
with
a
dying
bum
or
break
up
a
range
stampede
such
are
the
men
of
the
mounted
police
and
such
are
the
men
they
breed
the
snow
lay
deep
at
the
snake
creek
post
and
deep
to
east
and
west
and
the
sergeant
had
made
his
beat
and
settled
down
to
rest
in
his
that
they
called
a
post
where
the
flag
flew
overhead
and
he
took
a
look
at
his
monthly
mail
and
this
is
the
note
he
read
to
sergeant
blue
of
the
mounted
police
at
the
post
of
snake
creek
bend
from
marshal
of
county
blank
greetings
to
you
my
friend
they
a
team
of
toughs
give
us
the
slip
though
they
shot
up
a
couple
of
blokes
and
we
reckon
they
hid
in
snake
creek
gulch
and
posin
as
farmer
folks
they
as
full
of
sin
as
a
barrel
of
booze
and
as
quick
as
a
cat
with
a
gun
so
if
you
happen
to
hit
their
trail
be
first
to
start
the
fun
and
send
out
your
strongest
squad
of
men
and
round
them
up
if
you
can
for
dead
or
alive
we
want
them
here
yours
truly
jack
mcmann
and
sergeant
blue
sat
back
and
smiled
ho
here
is
a
chance
of
game
folks
here
have
been
so
good
that
life
is
getting
tame
i
know
the
lie
of
snake
creek
gulch
where
i
used
to
set
my
traps
i
blow
out
there
and
i
bring
them
in
perhaps
next
morning
sergeant
blue
arrayed
in
farmer
smock
and
jeans
in
a
jumper
sleigh
he
had
made
himself
set
out
for
the
evergreens
that
grow
on
the
bank
of
snake
creek
gulch
by
a
homestead
shack
he
knew
and
a
smoke
curled
up
from
the
to
welcome
sergeant
blue
aha
and
that
looks
good
to
me
said
the
sergeant
to
the
smoke
for
the
lad
that
owns
this
homestead
shack
is
east
in
his
there
are
strangers
here
and
i
bet
a
farm
against
a
horn
of
booze
that
they
are
the
bums
that
are
predestined
to
dangle
in
a
noose
so
he
drove
his
horse
to
the
shanty
door
and
hollered
a
loud
and
a
couple
of
men
with
came
out
beside
the
sleigh
and
the
sergeant
said
i
a
stranger
here
and
i
driven
a
weary
mile
if
you
do
object
i
just
sit
down
by
the
stove
in
the
shack
awhile
so
the
sergeant
sat
and
smoked
and
talked
of
the
home
he
had
left
down
east
and
the
cold
and
the
snow
and
the
price
of
land
and
the
life
of
man
and
beast
but
all
of
a
sudden
he
broke
it
off
with
neighbors
take
a
nip
there
a
horn
of
the
best
you
find
out
there
in
my
jumper
in
the
grip
so
one
of
the
two
went
out
for
it
and
as
soon
as
he
closed
the
door
the
other
one
staggered
back
as
he
gazed
up
the
nose
of
a
but
the
sergeant
wasted
no
words
with
him
now
fellow
you
on
the
rocks
and
a
noise
as
loud
as
a
mouse
from
you
and
they
take
you
out
in
a
box
so
he
fastened
the
bracelets
to
his
wrists
and
his
legs
with
some
and
he
took
his
knife
and
he
took
his
gun
and
he
rolled
him
onto
the
bed
and
then
as
number
two
came
in
he
said
if
you
want
to
live
put
up
your
dukes
and
behave
yourself
or
i
make
you
into
a
sieve
and
when
he
had
coupled
them
each
to
each
and
laid
them
out
on
the
bed
it
cold
and
i
guess
we
better
eat
before
we
go
he
said
so
he
fried
some
pork
and
he
warmed
some
beans
and
he
set
out
the
best
he
saw
and
they
ate
thereof
and
he
paid
for
it
according
to
british
law
that
night
in
the
post
sat
sergeant
blue
with
paper
and
pen
in
hand
and
this
is
the
word
he
wrote
and
signed
and
mailed
to
a
foreign
land
to
marshall
of
county
blank
greetings
i
give
to
you
my
squad
has
just
brought
in
your
men
and
the
squad
was
sergeant
blue
are
things
unguessed
there
are
tales
untold
in
the
life
of
the
great
lone
land
but
here
is
a
fact
that
the
alone
may
understand
that
a
thousand
miles
in
the
fastness
the
fear
of
the
law
obtains
and
the
pioneers
of
justice
were
the
riders
of
the
plains
alkali
hall
when
lord
landseeker
came
out
west
to
have
a
look
around
and
spend
a
little
money
if
the
right
thing
could
be
found
he
had
breathed
the
prairie
air
more
than
a
day
or
two
until
he
was
the
centre
of
a
philanthropic
crew
who
sought
to
show
his
lordship
all
the
shortcuts
to
success
though
why
they
should
have
troubled
his
lordship
could
guess
for
each
was
losing
money
as
he
candidly
confessed
which
seemed
to
be
a
fashion
with
the
dealers
in
the
west
thus
his
lordship
grew
suspicious
that
his
friends
would
turn
him
down
and
he
quietly
bought
a
ticket
to
a
little
country
town
but
he
did
know
the
message
that
was
flashed
along
the
wire
to
a
simple
country
dealer
in
the
land
of
his
desire
and
it
read
look
out
for
goggles
he
be
with
you
this
and
the
crowd
around
the
station
well
he
merely
smiled
to
them
and
thought
it
jolly
decent
they
assemble
and
file
along
behind
him
as
they
followed
in
a
row
the
snow
had
fallen
softly
all
the
calm
november
night
and
the
morning
found
the
praires
with
a
covering
of
white
but
his
lordship
took
a
citizen
who
happened
in
his
way
and
they
drove
into
the
country
for
the
most
part
of
the
day
until
they
reached
a
section
that
was
flat
and
free
from
stone
and
the
citizen
remarked
about
a
fellow
he
had
known
who
offered
thirty
dollars
for
this
section
in
the
fall
but
the
owner
wanted
forty
or
he
would
sell
at
all
then
his
lordship
drove
across
it
and
it
seemed
to
catch
his
eye
and
he
whispered
to
the
driver
that
the
section
i
will
buy
so
in
town
they
found
the
owner
who
was
very
loath
to
sell
but
he
finally
consented
if
his
lordship
would
tell
that
the
price
was
forty
dollars
by
the
acre
this
agreed
a
lawyer
drew
the
papers
and
his
lordship
got
the
deed
and
he
sailed
across
the
ocean
with
the
satisfying
thought
that
he
followed
his
own
judgment
in
the
bargain
he
had
bought
the
winter
snows
had
vanished
and
the
spring
was
growing
late
when
lord
landseeker
came
again
to
view
his
real
estate
and
he
drove
out
in
a
buggy
to
where
his
section
lay
and
his
heart
was
very
happy
as
he
smoked
along
the
way
till
the
section
burst
upon
them
and
he
scarce
believed
his
sight
for
the
land
lay
in
the
sunshine
flashing
back
a
snowy
white
and
his
lordship
stooped
and
felt
it
and
he
heaved
a
little
sigh
as
the
knowledge
dawned
upon
him
that
his
land
was
his
lordship
did
some
thinking
as
they
journeyed
back
to
town
and
his
wonted
happy
features
were
with
a
frown
but
he
neither
crawled
nor
blustered
neither
bluffed
nor
swore
nor
kicked
for
the
men
from
little
england
never
know
when
they
are
licked
but
he
advertised
for
tenders
for
construction
on
the
land
and
the
buildings
he
erected
were
the
best
he
could
command
with
a
hundred
rooms
for
students
and
quarters
for
the
staff
and
the
workmen
often
wondered
what
made
his
lordship
laugh
in
the
papers
of
old
england
there
appeared
a
little
ad
for
the
benefit
of
parents
whose
sons
were
going
bad
teach
your
boys
the
art
of
farming
in
the
great
canadian
west
our
instruction
is
unrivalled
our
curriculum
the
best
there
a
grate
in
every
chamber
and
a
bath
in
every
hall
and
a
full
dinner
every
free
to
all
there
is
tennis
polo
marksmanship
and
half
the
day
in
bed
and
we
make
them
into
farmers
for
a
hundred
pounds
a

his
lordship
college
prospers
and
is
crowded
to
the
doors
with
students
playing
poker
while
the
servants
do
the
chores
what
they
do
not
know
of
farming
they
make
up
in
other
lines
they
are
judges
of
tobacco
and
connoisseurs
of
wines
they
are
experts
at
the
races
and
at
sundry
other
games
though
they
could
tell
the
breeching
of
the
harness
from
the
hames
though
they
far
from
home
and
kindred
they
occasion
no
alarm
was
what
their
parents
wanted
when
they
sent
them
out
to
prairie
born
we
have
heard
the
night
wind
howling
as
we
lay
alone
in
bed
we
have
heard
the
grey
goose
honking
as
he
journeyed
overhead
we
have
smelt
the
flying
in
the
hot
october
wind
and
have
fought
the
fiery
demon
that
came
roaring
down
behind
we
have
seen
the
spent
snow
sifting
through
the
of
the
door
and
the
crawling
crawling
like
a
snake
along
the
floor
we
have
felt
the
wrestle
with
the
rafters
in
his
might
and
the
baffled
blizzard
shrieking
through
the
turmoil
of
the
night
we
have
felt
the
april
breezes
warm
along
the
plashy
plains
we
have
to
the
cadence
of
the
falling
april
rains
we
have
heard
the
crash
of
water
where
the
rivers
run
seen
a
thousand
silver
lakelets
lying
shining
in
the
sun
we
have
known
the
resurrection
of
the
springtime
in
the
land
heard
the
voice
of
nature
calling
and
the
words
of
her
command
felt
the
thrill
of
springtime
twilight
and
the
vague
unfashioned
thought
that
the
season
birthday
musters
from
the
hopes
we
had
forgot
we
have
heard
the
cattle
lowing
in
the
silent
summer
nights
we
have
smelt
the
fragrance
we
have
seen
the
lights
we
have
heard
the
wild
duck
grumbling
to
his
mate
along
the
bank
heard
the
thirsty
horses
snorting
in
the
stream
from
which
they
drank
heard
the
voice
of
youth
and
laughter
in
the
long
night
seen
the
arched
electric
splendor
of
the
great
north
livid
light
read
the
reason
of
existence
felt
the
touch
that
was
divine
and
in
eyes
that
glowed
responsive
saw
the
end
of
god
design
we
have
smelt
the
curing
wheat
fields
and
the
scent
of
hay
we
have
heard
the
binders
clatter
through
the
dusty
autumn
day
we
have
seen
the
golden
stubble
gleaming
through
the
misty
rain
we
have
seen
the
widen
as
they
turned
it
down
again
we
have
heard
the
threshers
humming
in
the
cool
september
night
we
have
seen
their
dark
procession
by
the
eerie
light
we
have
heard
the
freight
trains
groaning
slipping
grinding
on
the
rail
and
the
idle
trace
chains
jingle
as
they
jogged
along
the
trail
we
have
felt
the
cold
of
winter
cursed
by
those
who
know
it
not
we
have
braved
the
blizzard
vengeance
dared
its
most
deceptive
plot
we
have
learned
that
hardy
races
grow
from
hardy
circumstance
and
we
face
a
dozen
dangers
to
attend
a
country
dance
though
our
means
are
nothing
lavish
we
have
always
time
for
play
and
our
social
life
commences
at
the
closing
of
the
day
we
have
time
for
thought
and
culture
time
for
friendliness
and
friend
and
we
catch
a
broader
vision
as
our
aspirations
blend
we

hopes
to

foreign
aims
they
can
not

the

ages
we
the
of

though
we
think
with
fond
affection
of
the
shores
our
fathers
knew
and
we
honor
all
our
brothers
for
a
brother
heart
is
true
though
we
stand
with
them
for
progress
peace
and
unity
and
power
though
we
die
with
them
if
need
be
in
our
nation
darkest
hour
still
the
prairies
call
us
call
us
when
all
other
voices
fail
and
the
call
we
knew
in
childhood
is
the
call
that
must
prevail
a
colonial
some
circles
the
term
colonial
is
still
allowed
to
imply
inferiority
and
only
a
colonial
only
a
man
of
nerve
and
heart
who
has
spurned
the
ease
of
the
life
at
home
only
a
man
who
would
play
his
part
in
a
new
on
a
distant
loam
only
a
man
of
sense
and
worth
who
is
not
afraid
of
the
ends
of
earth
only
a
colonial
only
a
man
who
has
cornered
fate
and
matched
his
strength
with
the
unattained
only
the
guard
at
the
outer
gate
who
holds
for
you
what
he
has
gained
that
your
children
seized
of
a
better
sense
may
share
with
him
toil
recompense
only
a
colonial
only
a
man
who
has
bridged
the
deep
and
stained
the
map
a
british
hue
who
builds
an
empire
while
ye
sleep
and
deeds
the
ownership
to
you
is
the
viking
blood
which
gave
you
birth
that
has
driven
him
to
the
ends
of
earth
only
a
colonial
wherever
the
flag
that
ye
think
is
great
is
flown
to
the
farthest
winds
that
blow
wherever
the
colonists
ye
berate
in
their
blind
onward
go
ye
may
find
ye
hearts
that
are
british
still
in
your
do
ye
count
them
nil
only
a
colonial
rough
as
the
bark
of
his
forest
tree
his
ways
may
seem
to
the
fat
and
sleek
but
ye
owe
your
empire
to
such
as
he
though
the
glisten
on
his
cheek
he
has
carried
your
flag
where
ye
dared
not
go
and
little
ye
reck
of
the
debt
ye
owe
only
a
colonial
no
doubt
he
is
raw
on
your
social
laws
and
grates
on
your
sense
of
caste
and
creed
but
he
lives
too
near
to
facts
and
cause
to
study
heraldry
and
breed
and
knowing
man
in
his
primal
state
he
scorns
the
claims
of
the
social
great
only
a
colonial
the
name
in
cheap
contempt
ye
fling
is
not
the
whim
of
birth
or
chance
we
well
ignore
the
flippant
sting
or
charge
it
to
your
ignorance
the
colonist
and
sons
of
his
have
made
the
empire
what
it
is
little
tim
trotter
little
tim
trotter
was
born
in
the
west
where
the
prairie
lies
sunny
and
brown
never
was
surely
so
welcome
a
guest
in
the
stateliest
halls
of
the
town
for
little
tim
trotter
was
thoughtful
and
brave
and
a
lover
of
summer
and
shower
and
little
tim
trotter
took
less
than
he
gave
to
the
hearts
that
were
under
his
power
little
tim
trotter
would
play
in
the
sun
or
lie
in
the
buffalo
grass
and
in
fancy
he
saw
the
wild
buffalo
run
and
the
indians
pass
and
with
eyes
that
were
deep
as
the
infinite
blue
he
would
picture
himself
at
their
head
for
no
one
so
young
as
this
knew
that
the
herds
and
the
riders
were
dead
little
tim
trotter
would
lie
in
his
bed
while
the
played
low
on
the
floor
and
strange
were
the
thought
that
in
little
tim
head
played
low
like
the
fire
at
the
door
the
hopes
that
were
his
and
the
wonders
he
knew
and
the
yearning
he
had
in
his
heart
with
the
glimmering
light
of
the
future
in
view
and
little
tim
just
at
the
start
little
tim
trotter
has
heard
the
long
call
and
has
answered
with
joy
and
surprise
and
the
thoughts
and
the
things
that
are
hid
from
us
all
are
revealed
to
his
eyes
and
he
rides
in
the
van
of
his
buffalo
herd
or
in
camp
with
his
indians
brave
but
little
tim
trotter
speaks
never
a
word
through
the
mound
of
a
little
green
grave
the
vortex
he
farmed
his
own
and
was
doing
fairly
well
there
were
seasons
when
the
yield
was
rather
small
but
he
always
had
his
living
and
had
always
stuff
to
sell
and
a
little
to
his
credit
in
the
fall
but
he
wearied
of
his
labor
and
he
turned
a
wistful
eye
where
the
city
flashed
its
glamour
on
the
stranger
passing
by
he
was
sick
of
hogs
and
cattle
he
was
sick
of
barn
and
sty
and
the
city
sucked
him
in
he
was
doing
homestead
duties
he
was
in
his
second
year
and
his
quarter
was
the
finest
he
a
neighbor
in
the
township
and
they
called
that
pretty
near
and
he
only
had
to
eat
and
do
the
chores
now
he
should
have
been
contented
with
a
kingdom
of
his
own
he
a
fiddle
and
a
rifle
and
a
bally
gramophone
he
was
sick
of
isolation
sick
of
living
there
alone
and
the
city
sucked
him
in
he
owned
a
little
country
store
and
traded
goods
for
eggs
he
was
salesman
buyer
manager
and
clerk
and
the
farmers
gathered
in
his
shop
and
sat
around
on
kegs
while
they
smoked
and
wished
they
did
have
to
work
he
was
tired
of
tasting
butter
that
he
did
dare
condemn
he
was
tired
of
narrow
farmers
he
was
tired
of
serving
them
and
he
thought
him
of
the
city
where
they
close
at
six
and
the
city
sucked
him

ran
a
country
paper
in
the
town
of

he
hustled
news
and
helped
to
dis
the
dead
he
was
editor
and
devil
he
was
master
of
the
show
and
the
union
had
no
halter
on
his
head
but
he
could
raise
his
circulation
over
twenty
quires
he
was
tired
of
washing
rollers
he
was
tired
of
building
fires
he
was
tired
of
eulogizing
men
he
knew
were
mostly
liars
and
the
city
sucked
him
in
he
practised
law
and
real
estate
and
owned
a
house
and
lot
he
a
client
every

enough

he
tired
of
country
customs
and
he
wanted
fashion

he
was
sick
of
fire
insurance
he
was
sick
of
drawing

and
the
city
sucked
him
in

a
loyal
congregation

his
views
were
orthodox

his
salary
was
less
than
he
was
worth
he
a
personal
regard
for
the
future
of
his
flocks
and
he
shared
with

their
sorrow

their
mirth

he
longed
for
larger
service
and
for
bright
companionship
and
a
stipend
that
would
justify
his
wife
to
take
a
trip
and
he
read
his
resignation
and
he
packed
his
little
grip
and
the
city
sucked
him
in
she
was
just
a
country
maiden
with
ambitions
of
her
own
she
could
wash
and
she
could
churn
and
she
could
cook
but
she
longed
for
broader
vision
and
a
bigger
better
zone
and
she
studied
all
about
it
in
a
book
she
a
home
and
she
had
kindred
she
a
roof
above
her
head
she
had
time
for
work
and
leisure
she
a
chance
to
love
and
wed
but
they
saw
her
leave
the
village
they
had
better
seen
her
dead
and
the
city
sucked
her
in
now
there
one
of
them
a
millionaire
and
one
of
them
in
jail
and
one
of
them
is
working
on
the
street
and
one
is
washing
dishes
and
one
has
hit
the
trail
for
six
have
drunk
the
sorrows
of
defeat
and
one
that
never
spoken
of
where
once
she
was
supreme
and
one
they
found
him
floating
in
an
eddy
of
the
stream
they
have
paid
the
price
of
knowledge
they
have
dreamed
their
little
dream
and
the
city
sucked
them
in
the
old
guard
knew
you
the
men
of
the
old
guard
men
of
the
camp
and
trail
guard
of
the
van
when
time
began
in
the
land
of
grass
and
gale
of
a
land
they
seized
command
where
the
mightiest
prevail
who
were
the
men
of
the
old
guard
giants
of
strength
and
will
trained
in
the
school
of
rule
and
daring
to
die
or
kill
staking
their
lives
and
their
young
and
wives
on
the
road
up
fortune
hill
whence
were
the
men
of
the
old
guard
heroes
of
from
swamp
and
ledge
and
ocean
edge
they
came
to
see
and
do
and
they
failed
at
first
and
the
land
they
cursed
but
they
stayed
and
struggled
through
hope
of
the
men
of
the
old
guard
little
but
hope
was
theirs
with
empty
hand
in
an
untried
land
they
clutched
at
wheat
and
tares
and
home
at
night
by
the
light
was
answer
to
their
prayers
way
of
the
men
of
the
old
guard
what
of
their
end
and
way
you
may
find
their
bones
by
the
stones
where
the
lay
for
the
goddess
trade
is
a
costly
jade
and
they
were
the
ones
to
pay
joy
of
the
men
of
the
old
guard
the
joy
of
the
brave
and
true
with
joy
they
paced
where
death
grimaced
and
his
icy
vapors
blew
and
with
steady
tread
they
bore
their
dead
with
the
faith
of
the
chosen
few
what
of
the
men
of
the
old
guard
ask
of
the
arching
skies
the
grass
that
waves
on
their
leafy
graves
is
lisping
their
lullabies
and
the
lives
they
spent
are
their
monument
and
their
title
to
paradise
kid
mccann
where
the
farthest
foothills
flatten
to
a
plain
and
the
cattle
lands
surrender
to
the
onward
march
of
grain
where
the
prairies
stretch
unbroken
to
the
corners
of
the
sky
and
the
foremost
wheat
fields
rustle
in
the
warm
winds
droning
by
there
a
crippled
cowboy
batches
in
the
haunts
of
herds
and
the
balance
of
the
story
is
repeated
in
his
words
so
you
never
heard
how
i
lost
my
leg
and
hobble
now
on
a
crutch
so
far
as
the
story
relates
to
me
it
ca
concern
you
much
for
it
really
the
story
of
kid
mccann
and
the
price
that
a
girl
will
pay
for
the
fellow
she
sets
her
fancy
on
as
only
a
woman
may
it
is
every
girl
who
proves
her
faithfulness
in
flames
but
fellows
who
listen
with
moistened
eyes
speak
softly
of
other
names
ned
mccann
owned
the
double
star
back
in
the
early
days
he
had
come
out
here
with
a
sickly
wife
and
a
kid
he
hoped
to
raise
where
the
climate
suited
the
but
life
was
scarce
at
its
brim
till
a
little
mound
by
a
prairie
hill
held
half
of
the
world
for
him
and
his
double
love
would
have
spoiled
the
child
had
she
been
like
me
or
you
but
her
only
thought
was
for
her
dad
and
the
mother
she
scarcely
knew
she
was
bred
to
the
ranges
and
before
she
had
reached
her
teens
she
could
straddle
a
nag
with
the
best
of
us
and
ride
in
her
smock
and
jeans
till
we
all
caved
in
and
she
thought
it
fun
to
camp
with
the
bunch
and
she
shared
her
pillow
and
shared
our
sky
and
shared
our
pipe
and
lunch
and
all
of
us
mad
in
love
with
her
but
she
was
only
a
kid
and
she
never
dreamt
what
our
feelings
were
or
the
things
we
did
but
even
girls
grow
older
and
though
always
kind
and
sweet
there
came
a
day
when
she
realized
that
we
were
at
her
feet
but
i
had
never
spoken
nor
anyone
in
the
camp
when
in
came
a
foreign
puncher
a
thoroughbred
scamp
and
we
who
had
known
her
since
childhood
saw
in
our
unbelieving
eyes
this
wily
sinner
setting
himself
to
carry
off
the
prize
of
course
it
could
be
stood
for
and
little
as
i
might
like
it
fell
to
my
lot
to
intimate
to
him
it
was
time
to
hike
which
i
did
in
straightforward
manner
in
a
way
to
be
understood
and
he
looked
at
me
with
a
sulky
scowl
that
boded
none
of
us
good
but
he
did
as
he
was
ordered
to
be
absent
before
night
and
we
lost
his
form
in
the
shadowy
east
as
he
cantered
out
of
sight
next
day
as
i
rode
on
my
cayuse
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
gang
i
felt
a
sudden
rip
in
my
leg
like
the
jab
of
a
tang
and
my
horse
went
down
below
me
with
my
leg
crushed
in
the
clay
and
over
me
leered
that
fiendish
face
and
he
grinned
and
rode
away
rode
away
to
the
eastward
i
saw
him
fade
in
the
sky
and
crushed
and
pinned
from
hip
to
heel
i
counted
the
hours
to
die
how
long
i
lay
i
could
never
tell
for
the
hours
were
days
to
me
till
struck
with
sudden
terror
i
tore
at
my
wounded
knee
for
the
east
wind
carried
a
smoky
smell
and
i
read
in
its
fiery
breath
that
of
grass
was
all
between
me
and
death
with
my
i
hacked
my
leg
but
i
could
cut
the
bone
so
i
set
myself
as
best
i
could
to
face
my
fate
alone
the
fire
came
on
like
a
hungry
fiend
on
the
wings
of
the
rising
wind
and
i
would
care
to
tell
you
all
the
things
that
were
in
my
mind
i
saw
the
sun
through
the
swirling
smoke
and
the
blue
sky
far
above
and
i
bade
to
the
things
of
earth
and
the
dearer
hopes
of
love
and
i
figured
that
i
had
closed
accounts
for
life
uncertain
span
when
a
broncho
galloped
up
and
there
sat
kid
mccann
there
was
much
time
for
talking
with
the
in
our
ears
but
we
sometimes
live
in
seconds
more
than
we
could
in
a
thousand
of
years
and
before
i
could
guess
her
meaning
she
had
thrown
herself
on
my
face
and
spread
her
leather
jacket
which
her
warm
hands
held
in
place
i
felt
her
breath
in
my
nostrils
and
her
fingertips
in
my
hair
and
through
the
roar
of
the
burning
grass
i
fancied
i
heard
a
prayer
was
but
for
a
moment
the
flames
were
gone
unharmed
they
had
passed
me
by
god
knows
why
the
useless
are
spared
to
live
while
the
faithful
are
called
to
die
but
the
form
that
had
sheltered
me
shivered
and
seemed
to
shrivel
away
and
when
i
had
raised
it
clear
of
my
face
i
looked
into
lifeless
and
darkness
fell
and
the
world
was
black
and
the
last
of
my
reason
fled
and
when
i
came
to
myself
again
i
was
back
at
the
ranch
in
bed
that
was
back
in
the
eighties
and
still
i
am
living
here
i
built
this
shanty
on
the
spot
her
grave
is
lying
near
and
when
at
nights
my
nostrils
sense
the
in
the
air
i
seem
to
feel
her
form
again
and
hear
again
her
prayer
and
then
the
darkness
settles
down
and
wild
cry
but
stars
come
out
in
heaven
and
there
comfort
in
the
sky
who
owns
the
land
who
owns
the
land
the
duke
replied
i
own
the
land
my
fathers
died
in
winning
it
from
foreign
hands
they
paid
in
red
blood
for
their
lands
their
swarthy
bit
the
dust
in
founding
the
landowners
trust
and
many
generations
dead
substantiate
what
i
have
said
the
land
belongs
to
us
because
we
had
the
making
of
the
laws
who
owns
the
land
the
common
man
said
government
adopts
a
plan
by
which
the
land
is
held
in
fee
for
common
folks
like
you
an
me
the
man
who
alter
it
a
crank
i
got
the
transfer
in
the
bank
i
little
time
to
think
about
these
theories
silly
fellows
shout
i
have
to
work
to
beat
the
band
to
pay
the
mortgage
on
the
land
who
owns
the
land
the
statesman
said
the
land
supplies
our
daily
bread
and
raises
wheat
and
corn
and
oats
and
simple
husbandmen
and
votes
the
land
was
won
at
awful
cost
and
many
soldiers
lives
were
lost
too
bad
they
mostly
silly
boys
who
go
to
battle
for
the
noise
here
a
quotation
i
admire
people
voice
is
god
desire
and
as
i
rule
by
right
divine
i
half
suspect
the
land
is
mine
who
owns
the
land
the
farmer
said
what
puts
that
question
in
yer
head
i
own
it
tuk
a
homestead
here
an
lived
on
it
fer
twenty
year
i
bet
a
new
ten
dollar
bill
that
i
could
hold
it
down
until
i
got
the
patent
an
i
won
the
land
is
mine
as
sure
a
gun
when
city
blokes
come
here
to
shoot
you
bet
they
get
the
icy
boot
but
made
me
mighty
mad
when
that
danged
railway
come
across
the
flat
an
cut
my
homestead
plumb
in
two
but
there
i
wuz
what
could
i
do
but
jest
set
down
resigned
to
fate
fer
fear
that
they
expropriate
who
owns
the
land
the
speculator
said
land
is
just
an
incubator
in
which
to
let
your
dollars
hatch
and
some
fine
morning
sell
the
batch
who
owns
the
land
the
indian
chief
said
ugh
the
white
man
mucha
thief
he
steal
my
lan
because
he
strong
by
gar
it
take
him
pretty
long
he
steal
my
lan
an
call
it
law
he
turn
me
out
me
an
my
squaw
he
let
us
die
because
we
not
like
him
can
live
in
one
same
spot
he
talk
so
much
of
civilize
he
civil
sometimes
an
he
lies
who
owns
the
land
the
said
all
these
people
claim
to
which
is
satisfactory
to
me
so
long
as
they
can
not
agree
let
them
arrange
it
as
they
will
as
long
as
some
one
pays
the
bill
the
present
plan
is
surely
fine
interest
at
least
is
who
owns
the
land
in
meek
surprise
the
child
said
like
the
air
and
skies
and
running
water
flowers
and
birds
and
lullabies
and
gentle
words
and
rosy
sunsets
clouds
and
storms
and
god
revealed
in
all
his
forms
is
plain
the
land
the
right
of
birth
of
every
creature
on
the
earth
man
can
make
a
grain
of
sand
how
can
he
say
he
owns
the
land
a
race
for
life
related
for
the
benefit
of
the
new
yes
stranger
i
hev
trailed
the
west
since
i
wuz
a
kid
on
a
nag
i
hev
known
the
old
land
at
its
best
an
packed
most
kind
of
jag
i
hev
rode
fer
life
frum
a
prairie
fire
an
tramped
fer
life
through
a
snow
blockade
i
hev
crumpled
bad
men
by
the
quire
but
only
once
hev
i
been
afraid
i
hev
lain
alone
while
the
aroun
me
in
their
i
have
soothed
the
widow
while
she
because
i
made
her
man
a
saint
i
hev
lassooed
lobsters
frum
the
east
till
in
their
system
shook
an
i
never
run
frum
man
or
beast
until
i
run
frum
a
chinook
the
chinook
had
his
lair
in
crow
nest
pass
an
he
foraged
aroun
the
porcupine
hills
but
he
loafed
so
long
that
the
ranchin
grass
had
a
cover
frum
the
chills
an
me
like
a
chap
that
wuz
not
afraid
of
anything
with
hide
an
hair
went
out
in
a
sleigh
to
the
hills
an
stayed
till
the
old
chinook
might
find
me
there
at
last
when
i
thought
i
had
tempted
fate
enough
fer
a
man
with
a
past
like
mine
i
hitched
the
bronks
an
struck
a
gait
along
the
slopes
of
the
porcupine
an
the
day
wuz
as
cold
as
the
polar
sea
with
a
nip
as
keen
as
a
fang
but
frost
wuz
just
like
food
to
me
an
boldly
over
the
fields
i
sang
i
am
the
man
frum
the
hole
in
the
hills
where
the
great
whiliken
capers
i
am
the
gent
that
pays
the
bills
when
they
plant
a
greenhorn
in
the
ground
i
am
the
finish
of
folks
that
think
they
can
run
a
bluff
on
the
fer
i
give
their
vitals
a
fatal
kink
when
i
open
up
with
a
shower
of
lead
an
the
cold
bit
into
my
nose
an
chin
an
drilled
itself
to
the
my
face
wuz
drawn
in
a
frozen
grin
an
my
fingers
rattled
like
lumps
of
stone
but
my
heart
wuz
as
brave
as
an
outlaw
stag
an
i
laughed
though
the
frost
cut
like
a
knife
till
sudden
i
felt
the
hind
bob
drag
an
i
knew
i
wuz
in
fer
a
race
fer
life
out
from
his
lair
the
sly
chinook
had
hunted
me
with
his
fatal
breath
i
dared
not
turn
aroun
to
look
fer
to
strand
on
the
hillside
there
wuz
death
the
hot
wind
sizzled
along
my
back
an
the
sweat
stood
out
on
my
so
i
yelled
at
the
team
through
the
frozen
crack
the
roll
of
the
tongue
in
my
mouth
had
made
get
out
o
here
by
the
polar
star
the
fiend
of
the
south
is
on
your
heels
an
i
felt
the
old
sleigh
cringe
an
jar
an
fer
once
i
prayed
fer
a
pair
o
wheels
but
the
sleigh
stood
still
as
the
hind
bob
stuck
in
mud
that
rolled
to
the
so
i
slipped
the
tongue
an
cursed
my
luck
as
i
straddled
a
bronk
an
hit
the
trail
well
we
beat
it
out
by
half
a
neck
but
the
broncho
tail
was
scorched
a
sight
an
i
wuz
a
blistered
parboiled
wreck
an
nearly
