by
matilda
betham
to
lady
rouse
boughton
as
a
testimony
of
respect
and
gratitude
for
long
continued
friendship
this
little
volume
is
inscribed
by

obliged
humble
servant

betham
advertisement
before
this
book
was
printed
i
thoughtlessly
concluded
there
must
be
a
preface
but
on
consideration
see
no
particular
purpose
it
would
answer
and
gladly
decline
a
task
i
should
have
undertaken
with
much
timidity
and
reluctance
all
i
feel
necessary
to
premise
is
that
the
tale
in
the
old
shepherd
recollections
is
founded
on
an
event
which
happened
in
ireland
and
that
last
spring
i
suppressed
the
song
ending
in
page
the
old
man
farewell
some
time
after
it
had
been
in
the
hands
of
the
composer
from
meeting
accidentally
with
a
quotation
in
a
magazine
that
resembled
it

poems
the
old
fisherman
bosom
is
chill
with
the
cold
my
limbs
their
lost
vigour
deplore
alas
to
the
lonely
and
old
hope
warbles
her
promise
no
more
out
with
the
length
of
my
way
i
must
rest
me
awhile
on
the
beach
to
feel
the
salt
dash
of
the
spray
if
haply
so
far
it
may
reach
the
billows
arise
i
reflect
on
the
days
that
are
past
when
the
pride
of
my
strength
could
despise
the
force
of
the
blast
the
heavens
might
menace
on
high
i
would
still
push
my
vessel
from
shore
at
my
calling
undauntedly
ply
and
sing
as
i
handled
the
oar
fortune
rewarded
my
toil
and
my
nets
i
drew
i
hurried
me
home
with
the
spoil
and
its
inmates
rejoic
at
the
view
the
winds
and
the
waves
were
perverse
i
was
sure
to
be
welcom
with
glee
my
presence
the
cares
would
disperse
that
were
only
awaken
for
me
weary
with
toiling
in
vain
or
gay
from
abundant
success
i
heard
the
same
blessing
again
i
met
the
same
tender
caress
fancied
the
perils
repay
that
could
such
affection
ensure
by
fondness
and
gratitude
sway
i
was
eager
to
dare
and
endure
cot
did
each
comfort
contain
and
that
gave
my
bosom
delight
when
drench
by
the
winterly
rain
i
watch
in
my
vessel
at
night
alas
from
the
tyrant
disease
what
love
or
what
caution
can
save
a
fever
more
harsh
than
the
seas
consign
my
poor
wife
to
the
grave
children
so
tenderly
rear
and
pining
for
want
of
her
care
though
more
by
my
sorrows
endear
could
not
rescue
my
heart
from
despair
tempted
the
dangers
of
night
and
still
labour
hard
at
the
oar
my
sufferings
appear
to
be
light
but
i
suffer
with
pleasure
no
more
yet
when
some
seasons
had
roll
i
seem
to
awaken
anew
my
children
i
lov
to
behold
how
tall
and
how
comely
they
grew
boy
became
hardy
and
bold
his
spirit
was
buoyant
and
free
and
as
i
grew
thoughtful
and
old
was
loud
and
oppressive
to
me
the
girl
like
a
bird
in
the
bower
awaken
my
hope
and
my
pride
she
won
on
my
heart
hour
and
i
could
not
the
preference
hide
mark
the
address
and
the
care
the
manner
endearing
and
mild
not
dreaming
those
qualities
rare
were
to
murther
the
peace
of
my
child
grandeur
would
ever
descend
to
seek
for
so
lowly
a
bride
or
his
fair
one
a
lover
pretend
from
all
she
held
dear
to
divide
beauty
was
priz
like
a
gem
expected
to
dazzle
and
shine
whose
value
the
world
would
contemn
unless
trac
to
some
indian
mine
hapless
girl
had
i
known
thou
hadst
learnt
to
repine
at
thy
lot
that
splendour
and
rank
were
thy
own
thy
home
and
thy
father
forgot
lore
and
ambition
assail
thou
hadst
left
us
whatever
befel
my
pardon
and
prayers
had
prevail
i
had
blest
thee
and
bade
thee
farewel
thy
husband
from
this
happy
clime
i
had
seen
thee
for
ever
depart
still
hoping
affection
and
time
might
soften
the
pride
of
his
heart
a
moment
perhaps
would
arise
when
fondling
a
child
on
the
knee
he
might
read
in
its
innocent
eyes
a
lesson
of
pity
for
me
lips
which
till
then
never
said
a
word
to
cause
any
one
pain
inform
me
when
reason
had
fled
of
a
conflict
it
could
not
sustain
he
who
had
wish
to
conceal
that
the
woman
he
lov
had
been
poor
began
all
his
folly
to
feel
when
the
victim
could
hearken
no
more
still
for
himself
did
he
mourn
and
indignant
i
fled
from
the
view
for
my
wrongs
were
not
easily
borne
and
my
anger
was
hard
to
subdue
prop
one
sole
comfort
remain
who
saw
me
with
grief
who
saw
though
i
never
complain
my
heart
was
too
sick
for
relief
who
always
attentive
and
dear
every
effort
exerted
to
please
my
desolate
prospect
to
cheer
to
study
my
health
and
my
ease
his
was
each
toil
and
each
care
the
due
observations
to
keep
to
sit
watching
amid
the
night
air
and
fancy
his
father
asleep
dejected
and
sadly
forlorn
i
dar
in
my
heart
to
repine
to
lament
that
i
ever
was
born
though
such
worth
and
affection
were
mine
i
was
destin
to
know
however
intense
my
despair
i
still
was
reserv
for
a
blow
more
painful
and
cruel
to
bear
this
only
one
fell
in
the
main
i
eagerly
struggled
to
save
but
i
strove
with
the
current
in
vain
and
saw
him
sink
under
the
wave
head
was
astounded
and
wild
incessant
i
roam
on
the
shore
to
seek
the
dead
corse
of
my
child
and
to
weep
on
his
bosom
once
more
days
undisturb
was
the
sky
the
eighth
was
a
tempest
most
drear
i
saw
the
huge
billow
rise
high
i
saw
my
lost
treasure
appear
a
dream
it
seem
passing
away
i
hurried
me
onward
to
meet
and
clasp
the
inanimate
clay
when
senseless
i
sunk
at
his
feet
hands
now
enfeebled
by
time
the
last
pious
offices
paid
age
sorrow
youth
in
its
prime
and
my
boy
near
his
mother
was
laid
scar
by
the
griefs
i
have
known
wounds
apathy
only
can
heal
my
joys
and
my
sorrows
are
flown
for
i
have
forgotten
to
feel
i
know
my
creator
is
just
that
his
hand
will
deliver
me
soon
i
have
learnt
to
submit
and
to
trust

pleasure
as
he
passes
by
long
kept
in
exile
by
paternal
pride
he
feels
no
joy
beneath
this
splendid
dome
for
till
the
elder
child
of
promise
died
he
knew
a
dearer
though
a
humbler
home
then
the
proud
sail
was
spread

left
friend
and
every
scene
he
knew
for
ever
left
the
maid
though
his
heart
sicken
as
he
said
adieu
and
nurses
still
with
superstitious
care
the
sigh
of
fond
remembrance
and
despair
to
a
llangollen
rose
the
day
after
it
had
been
given
by
miss
ponsonby
soft
blushing
my
bosom
grieves
to
view
thy
sadly
drooping
leaves
for
while
their
tender
tints
decay
the
rose
of
fancy
fades
away
as
pilgrims
who
with
zealous
care
some
little
treasur
relic
bear
to
the
doubtful
mind
when
pausing
memory
looks
behind
i
from
a
more
enlighten
shrine
had
made
this
sweet
memento
mine
but
lo
its
fainting
head
reclines
it
folds
the
pallid
leaf
and
pines
as
mourning
the
unhappy
doom
which
tears
it
from
so
sweet
a
home
de
forlornly
i
wander
forlornly
i
sigh
and
droop
my
head
sadly
i
can
not
tell
why
when
the
first
breeze
of
morning
blows
fresh
in
my
face
as
the
walks
of
our
woodlands
i
trace
reviv
for
the
moment
i
look
all
around
but
my
eyes
soon
grow
languid
and
fix
on
the
ground
i
have
yet
no
misfortune
to
rob
me
of
rest
no
love
discomposes
the
peace
of
my
breast
ambition
enter
the
verge
of
my
thought
nor
by
honours
by
wealth
nor
by
power
am
i
caught
those
phantoms
of
folly
disturb
not
my
ease
yet
time
is
a
tortoise
and
life
a
disease
with
the
blessings
of
youth
and
of
health
on
my
side
a
temper
untainted
by
envy
or
pride
no
guilt
to
corrode
and
no
foes
to
molest
there
are
many
who
tell
me
my
station
is
blest
this
i
can
not
dispute
yet
without
knowing
why
i
feel
that
my
bosom
is
big
with
a
sigh
oh
why
do
i
see
that
all
knowledge
is
vain
that
science
finds
error
still
keep
in
her
train
that
imposture
or
darkness
with
doubt
and
surmise
will
mislead
will
perplex
and
then
baffle
the
wise
who
often
when
labours
have
shorten
their
span
declare
not
to
know
is
the
province
of
man
in
life
as
in
learning
our
views
are
confin
our
discernment
too
weak
to
discover
the
mind
which
subdued
and
irresolute
keeps
out
of
sight
or
if
for
a
moment
her
presence
delight
our
air
is
too
gross
for
the
stranger
to
stay
and
back
to
her
prison
she
hurries
away
if
my
own
narrow
precincts
i
seek
to
explore
my
wishes
how
vain
my
attainments
how
poor
tenacious
of
virtue
with
caution
i
move
i
correct
and
i
wrestle
but
can
not
approve
till
bewilder
and
faint
i
would
yield
up
the
rein
but
i
dare
not
in
peace
with
my
errors
remain
with
zeal
all
awake
in
the
cause
of
a
friend
with
warmth
unrepress
by
my
fear
to
offend
with
sympathy
active
in
hope
or
distress
how
keen
and
how
anxious
i
can
not
express
i
shrink
lest
an
eye
should
my
feelings
behold
and
my
heart
seems
insensible
selfish
and
cold
i
strive
to
be
gay
but
my
efforts
are
weak
and
sick
of
existence
for
pleasure
i
seek
i
mix
with
the
empty
the
loud
and
the
vain
partake
of
their
folly
and
double
my
pain
in
others
i
meet
with
depression
and
strife
oh
where
shall
i
seek
for
the
music
of
life
the
grandfather
departure
the
old
man
press
palemon
hand
to
lucy
nodded
with
a
smile
kiss
all
the
little
ones
around
then
clos
the
gate
and
paus
awhile
when
shall
i
come
again
he
thought
ere
yet
the
journey
had
begun
it
was
a
tedious
length
of
way
but
he
beheld
an
only
son
and
dearly
did
he
love
to
take
a
rosy
grandchild
on
his
knee
to
part
his
shining
locks
and
say
just
such
another
boy
was
he
and
never
felt
he
greater
pride
and
never
did
he
look
so
gay
as
when
the
little
urchins
strove
to
make
him
partner
in
their
play
but
when
in
some
more
gentle
mood
they
silent
hung
upon
his
arm
or
nestled
close
at
the
old
man
felt
a
softer
charm
and
upward
rais
his
closing
eye
whence
slow
effus
a
grateful
tear
as
if
his
senses
own
a
joy
too
holy
for
endurance
here
no
heart
pray
so
fervently
unprompted
by
an
earthly
zeal
none
ever
knew
such
tenderness
that
did
not
true
devotion
feel
as
with
the
pure
uncolour
flame
the
violet
richest
blues
unite
do
our
affections
soar
to
and
rarify
and
beam
with
light
reflections
occasioned
by
the
death
of
friends
my
happiness
was
once
a
goodly
tree
which
promis
every
day
to
grow
more
fair
and
rear
its
lofty
branches
in
the
air
in
sooth
it
was
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
amidst
fair
crept
along
twin
round
the
bark
and
hung
from
every
bough
while
birds
which
fancy
held
by
slender
strings
plum
the
dark
azure
of
their
shining
wings
or
dipp
them
in
the
silver
stream
below
with
many
a
joyful
note
and
many
a
song
when
lo
a
tempest
hurtles
in
the
sky
dark
the
clouds
the
thunders
burst
around
fiercely
the
arrowy
flakes
of
lightning
fly
while
the
scar
songsters
leave
the
bough
the
blasted
droop
below
and
many
noble
branches
strew
the
ground
though
soon
the
air
is
calm
the
sky
serene
though
wide
the
broad
and
leafy
arms
are
spread
yet
still
the
scars
of
recent
wounds
are
seen
their
shelter
henceforth
seems
but
insecure
the
winged
tribes
disdain
the
frequent
lure
where
many
a
songster
lies
benumb
or
dead
and
when
i
would
the
tendrils
train
i
find
my
late
delightful
labour
vain
affection
thus
once
light
of
heart
and
gay
chasten
by
memory
and
unnerv
by
fear
shall
sadden
each
endearment
with
a
tear
sorrowing
the
offices
of
love
shall
pay
and
scarcely
dare
to
think
that
good
her
own
which
fate
imperious
hand
may
snatch
away
in
the
warm
sunshine
of
meridian
day
and
when
her
hopes
are
full
and
fairest
blown
to
fancourt
july
i
love
not
yon
gay
painted
flower
of
bold
and
coarsely
blended
dye
but
one
whose
nicely
varied
power
may
long
detain
the
curious
eye
i
love
the
tones
that
softly
rise
and
in
a
fine
accordance
close
that
waken
no
abrupt
surprise
nor
leave
us
to
inert
repose
i
love
the
moon
pure
holy
light
pour
on
the
calm
sequester
stream
the
gale
fresh
from
the
wings
of
night
which
drinks
the
early
solar
beam
the
smile
of
heaven
when
storms
subside
when
the
moist
clouds
first
break
away
the
sober
tints
of
ere
yet
forgotten
by
the
day
such
sights
such
sounds
my
fancy
please
and
set
my
wearied
spirit
free
and
one
who
takes
delight
in
these
can
never
fail
of
loving
thee
to
a
young
gentleman
july
dear
boy
when
you
meet
with
a
rose
admire
you
the
thorns
very
much
or
like
you
to
play
with
a
ball
when
the
handling
it
blisters
your
touch
yet
should
it
be
firm
and
compact
it
is
easy
to
polish
it
nice
if
the
rose
is
both
pretty
and
sweet
the
thorns
will
come
off
in
a
trice
the
thistle
has
still
many
more
as
visible
too
in
our
eyes
but
who
will
take
pains
with
a
weed
that
nobody
ever
can
prize
is
what
we
deem
precious
and
rare
we
most
earnestly
seek
to
amend
and
anxious
attention
and
care
is
the
costliest
gift
of
a
friend
we
all
have
our
follies
what
then
let
us
note
them
and
never
look
bluff
without
any
caressing
at
all
they
will
cling
to
us
closely
enough
weeds
are
of
such
obstinate
growth
they
elude
the
most
diligent
hand
and
if
they
were
not
to
be
check
would
quickly
run
over
the
land
if
some
could
be
taken
away
that
hide
part
of
your
worth
from
the
view
the
conquest
perhaps
would
be
ours
but
the
profit
is
wholly
to
you
fragment
a
pilgrim
weary
i
reach
a
country
strange
and
rude
and
trembled
lest
approaching
eve
my
hope
of
shelter
might
deceive
when
i
espied
a
hunter
train
prowling
at
leisure
the
plain
and
hasten
on
to
ask
relief
of
the
haughty
chief
his
eye
was
artful
keen
and
bold
his
smile
malevolently
cold
and
had
not
all
my
fire
been
fled
and
every
earthly
passion
dead
his
pity
to
contempt
allied
had
rous
my
anger
and
my
pride
but
as
it
was
i
bent
my
way
where
his
secluded
mansion
lay
which
rose
before
my
eyes
at
length
a
fortress
of
determin
strength
and
layers
of
every
colour
moss
the
lofty
turrets
did
emboss
as
tho
the
hand
of
father
time
prepar
a
sacrifice
sublime
giving
his
daily
rites
away
to
aggrandize
some
future
day
here
as
i
roam
the
walk
along
i
heard
a
plaintive
broken
song
and
ere
i
to
the
portal
drew
an
open
window
caught
my
view
where
a
fair
dame
appear
in
sight
array
in
robes
of
purest
white
large
snowy
folds
confin
her
hair
and
left
a
polish
forehead
bare
her
meek
eyes
of
deepest
blue
the
sable
lash
long
shadows
threw
her
cheek
was
delicately
pale
and
seem
to
tell
a
piteous
tale
but
her
looks
such
patience
stole
such
tenderness
of
soul
that
never
did
my
eyes
behold
a
beauty
of
a
lovelier
mold
the
lady
sigh
and
closely
prest
a
sleeping
infant
to
her
breast
shook
off
sweet
tears
of
love
and
smil
kissing
the
fingers
of
the
child
which
round
her
own
unconscious
clung
then
fondly
gaz
and
softly
sung
once
like
that
sea
which
ebbs
and
flows
my
bosom
never
knew
repose
and
heavily
each
morn
arose
i
bore
with
anger
and
disdain
i
had
no
power
to
break
my
chain
no
one
to
whom
i
dar
complain
and
when
some
bird
has
caught
my
eye
or
distant
sail
been
flitting
by
i
wish
i
could
as
freely
fly
but
i
can
now
contented
be
can
tell
dear
babe
my
griefs
to
thee
and
feel
more
brave
and
breathe
more
free
and
when
thy
father
frowns
severe
although
my
spirit
faints
with
fear
i
feel
i
have
a
comfort
near
and
when
he
harshly
speaks
to
me
if
thou
art
smiling
on
my
knee
he
softens
as
he
looks
on
thee
to
soothe
him
in
an
evil
hour
the
bud
has
balm
oh
may
the
flower
possess
the
same
prevailing
power
nor
forc
to
leave
thy
native
land
to
pledge
a
cold
unwilling
hand
thou
receive
the
hard
command
my
mother
had
not
half
the
zeal
the
aching
fondness
which
i
feel
she
had
no
broken
heart
to
heal
and
i
was
friendless
when
she
died
who
could
my
little
failings
chide
and
for
an
hour
her
fondness
hide
but
i
can
see
no
prospect
ope
can
give
no
fairy
vision
scope
if
thou
art
not
the
spring
of
hope
i
can
not
thy
affection
draw
by
childhood
first
admiring
awe
be
tender
pity
then
thy
law
this
heart
would
bleed
at
every
vein
i
could
not
even
life
sustain
if
ever
thou
give
me
pain
o
soul
of
sweetness
can
it
be
that
thou
prove
unkind
to
me
that
i
should
fear
this
blow
from
thee
alas
then
i
would
not
blame
my
love
to
thee
should
be
the
same
and
judge
from
whence
unkindness
came
her
words
grew
indistinct
and
slow
her
voice
more
tremulous
and
low
when
suddenly
the
song
was
a
whisper
even
heard
no
more
she
had
discern
my
nearer
tread
appear
to
feel
alarm
and
fled
songs
song
thrice
lovely
babe
thus
hush
to
rest
upon
thy
warrior
father
breast
avails
it
that
his
eyes
behold
thy
rosy
cheeks
thy
locks
of
gold
avails
it
that
he
bends
his
ear
so
fondly
thy
soft
breath
to
hear
or
that
his
rising
smiles
confess
a
gracious
gleam
of
tenderness
the
sweetest
spell
will
scarce
have
to
hold
him
for
one
absent
hour
some
plant
that
ceases
thus
to
share
a
daily
friend
auspicious
care
relaxes
in
its
feeble
grasp
the
tendrils
soon
unclasp
loose
in
the
heedless
aether
play
and
every
idle
breeze
obey
thus
vainly
had
i
sought
to
bind
thus
watch
that
light
forgetful
mind
till
smiles
and
sunshine
could
restore
my
hopes
no

kind
a
graceful

unsway

a
voice
that
sinks
into
the
heart
a
playful
and
benignant
smile
alas
my
heart
responds
the
while
all
this
my
emily
is
true
but
i
love
more
in
loving
you
i
love
those
roses
when
they
rise
from
joy
from
anger
or
surprise
i
love
the
kind
attentive
zeal
so
prompt
to
know
what
others
feel
the
mildness
which
can
reprove
but
in
the
sweetest
tones
of
love
all
this
my
emily
is
true
but
i
love
more
in
loving
you
the
which
can
sustain
in
silence
weariness
and
pain
the
transport
at
a
friend
success
which
has
not
words
or
power
to
bless
but
by
a
sudden
starting
tear
appears
more
precious
more
sincere

this
my
emily
is
true

a

song
set
to

by

i
ponder
many
a
silent
hour
on
friends
belov
when
far
at
sea
and
tell
me
have
i
not
the
power
to
draw
one
kindred
thought
to
me
the
while
we
linger
on
the
coast
my
truant
fancy
homeward
flies
and
when
the
view
is
almost
lost
unmanly
tears
bedew
my
eyes
and
oft
forgetful
do
i
stand
nor
crew
nor
ship
nor
ocean
see
and
often
does
my
heart
demand
if
friends
belov
thus
think
on
me
and
when
to
england
bound
once
more
i
shall
with
fond
impatience
burn
will
not
some
others
on
the
shore
as
fondly
look
for
my
return
o
let
me
of
your
kindness
hear
repeat
the
strain
as
i
depart
it
swells
like
music
on
my
ear
it
falls
like
balm
upon
my
heart
another
written
earlier
adieu
to
old
england
adieu
to
my
friends
though
fortune
and
fame
i
pursue
on
thus
looking
around
me
i
can
not
conceal
how
reluctant
i
bid
them
adieu
my
heart
sinks
within
me
i
sigh
to
the
gale
thus
slowly
receding
from
shore
while
fancy
still
whispers
some
terrible
tale
ah
perhaps
i
may
see
it
no
more
there
all
that
i
love
that
i
value
remain
that
only
awakens
my
fears
for
will
the
same
spot
its
dear
inmates
contain
on
the
lapse
of
two
lingering
years
they
may
smile
in
good
fortune
or
weep
in
distress
i
shall
know
not
a
word
of
their
fate
no
pain
can
i
soften
no
sorrow
redress
i
may
come
when
alas
is
too
late
i
can
fly
without
fear
to
encounter
the
foe
to
my
earliest
wish
i
am
true
but
i
can
not
unmov
quit
the
friends
that
i
love

dear
country

away
oh
let
not

thy

i
shall

upon
thee
every

them
never
the

farewell

the
time
when
with

in

in
triumph
to
this
fervid
clime
i
bore
a
flowret

no

it
was
boundless
as
my

now
to

i
consign
thy
wounded

thy
feeble
health
a
charge
more
dear
than
life
resign
to
watch
a
little
worldly
wealth
duty
compels
me
to
remain
but
oh
how
heavy
feels
the
chain
my
dear
maria
smile
no
more
this
seeming
patience
makes
me
wild
so
thou
once
my
peace
restore
when
mourning
for
our
only
child
each
faint
appeal
was
lost
in
air
or
turn
my
sadness
to
despair
alas
i
only
make
thee
grieve
and
hark
the
boat
awaits
below
they
call
aloud
and
i
must
leave
the
tears
my
folly
forc
to
flow
oh
had
i
but
the
time
to
prove
that
mine
are
only

me

that
anguish
and
resentment
have
not
life
within
the
heart
that
ye
so
quiet
deem
in
this
forc
stillness
only
i
sustain
my
thought
and
feeling
wearied
out
with
pain
floating
as
upon
some
wild
abyss
whence
silent
patience
bending
the
brink
would
rescue
them
with
strong
and
steady
hand
and
join
again
by
that
connecting
link
which
now
is
broken
o
respect
her
care
respect
her
in
this
fearful
no
moment
teems
with
greater
woe
than
this
should
she
but
pause
or
falter
in
despair
on
the
regret
of
youth
before
a
rose
is
fully
blown
the
outward
leaves
announce
decay
so
ere
the
spring
of
youth
is
flown
its
tiny
pleasures
die
away
the
gay
security
we
feel
the
careless
soul
delighted
rest
that
lively
hope
that
ardent
zeal
and
smiling
sunshine
of
the
breast
those
simple
tints
so
bright
and
clear
no
healing
can
restore
for
joys
which
early
life
endear
once
blighted
can
revive
no
more
yet
lovely

the
rose
although
its
infant
graces
fly
the
various
opening
leaves

a
fairer
banquet
to
the
eye

ruby
beams
on
drifted
snow
such
pure
harmonious
blushes

if
distant
cast
a
tender
glow
but
near
its
own
imperial
red
the
form
assumes
a
prouder
air
and
bends
more
graceful
in
the
gale
while
from
its
cup
of
essence
rare
a
richer
hoard
of
sweets
exhale
could
we
again
by
fancy
led
that
bower
of
swelling
leaves
confine
and
round
that
fine
luxuriant
head
the
mossy
tendrils
now
entwine
over
what
multitudes
of
bloom
would
a
few
timid
leaflets
close

the

whose
glassy
waters
smoothly
flow
and
in
the
undulating
gleam
reflect
another
world
below
the
yellow
conway
as
it
raves
demands
my
tributary
song
when
rushing
forth
resistless
waves
rocky
fragments
foam
along
like
him
whose
vigorous
mind
reviews
the
troubles
which
around
him
roll
the
ceaseless
warfare
still
pursues
and
keeps
a
firm
undaunted
soul

hang
darkly
his

his

the
fix

of

to

it
is
not
apathy
that
reigns
arrogance
or
pride
for
in

fortitude

still

of
his

it

then

soon
within

thy

farewell
my

guest
farewell
a
few
days
since
thou
wert
unknown
none
shall
thy
future
fortunes
tell
but
sweetly
have
the
moments
flown
and
kindness
like
the
sun
on
flowers
soon
chas
away
thy
tender
gloom
the
hours
and
wove
bright
tints
in
fancy
loom
we
sought
no
secrets
to
divine
neither
thy
name
nor

knew
our
hearts
alone
have
question
thine
and
found
that
all
was
just
and
true
pass
not
with
hasty
step
i
pray
across
the
threshold
of
my
door
but
pause
awhile
with
kind
delay
we
shall
behold
thy
face
no
more
once
only
in
a
hundred
years
the
aloe
precious
blossoms
swell
so
in
thy
presence
it
appears
that
time
has

fare
thee
well
a

preface
song
distance
from
the
place
of
our
nativity
since
i
married
palemon
though
happy
my
lot
though
my
garden
is
pleasant
and
lightsome
my
cot
though
love
smile
like
a
sunshine
i
constantly
see
those
blessings
are
all
insufficient
for
me
i
repine
not
at
labour
i
ask
not
for
gold
but
i
want
the
sweet
eyes
of
my
friends
to
behold
with
palemon
i
think
the
world
i
could
roam
though
he
liv
in
a
desert
would
make
it
my
home
from
him
no
allurements
his
lucy
could
bribe
and
though
timid
no
dangers
no
menaces
drive
but
the
heart
that
can
love
with
devotion
so
true
is
not
cold
or
forgetful
my
parents
to
you
oh
idle
declaimers
how
is
it
ye
say
that
affection
and
tenderness
fade
and
decay
though
so
easily
pain
they
endure
like
a
gem
and
the
heart
and
the
mind
imbibe
colour
from
them
in
affliction
they
brighten
in
absence
refine
and
are
causes
of
sorrow
too
sweet
to
resign
the
old
shepherd
recollections
low
heavy
clouds
are
hanging
on
the
hills
and
of
the
sun
approach
shake
sullenly
their
cold
and
languid
wings
oh
it
is
fine
to
see
his
morning
beams
burst
on
the
gloom
while
in
disorder
flight
the
shuddering
mournful
vapours
steal
away
like
the
tenacious
spirit
of
a
man
shrinking
from
the
loud
voice
of
cheerfulness
when
it
breaks
in
so
sadly
out
of
tune
upon
his
quiet
musing
and
dispels
the
waking
dream
of
a
dejected
heart
the
dream
i
cherish
in
this
solitude
in
all
the
wanderings
of
my
little
flock
that
which
beguiles
my
loneliness
and
takes
its
charm
and
change
from
the
surrounding
scene
oh
how
unwelcome
often
are
to
me
the
gayest
most
exhilarating
sounds
when
slow
and
sickly
memory
tempted
forth
by
dint
of
soft
persuasion
brings
to
light
his
treasures
and
with
childish
eagerness
arranges
and
collects
then
suddenly
to
have
him
startled
by
discordance
drag
without
discrimination
all
away
and
with
them
leap
to
his
deep
hollow
cave
not
easily
to
be
withdrawn
again
grieves
one
who
loves
to
think
of
other
times
to
talk
with
those
long
silent
in
the
grave
and
pass
from
childhood
to
old
age
again
behold
this
stony
rock
whose
rifted
crest
lets
the
rough
roaring
torrent
force
a
way
and
foaming
pour
its
waters
on
the
vale
behold
them
tumbling
from
their
dizzy
height
like
clouds
of
more
than
snowy
whiteness
thrown
precipitate
from
which
as
they
fall
diffuse
a
mist
in
form
of
glory
round
this
was
my
darling
haunt
a
long
time
past
here
when
a
boy
in
pleasing
awe
i
sate
wistfully
silent
with
uplifted
eye
and
heart
attun
to
the
sad
lulling
sound
they
made
descending
far
below
my
feet
near
where
yon
little
ruin
cottage
lies
oft
at
the
pensive
hour
of
i
saw
young
osborne
bearing
on
his
harp
and
trusting
to
an
aged
mother
care
his
darkling
steps
beneath
that
falling
beech
whose
branches
touch
the
water
edge
he
lov
to
sit
and
feel
the
freshen
gale
breathe
cool
upon
him
then
that
falling
beech
was
a
young
graceful
tree
which
starting
up
amid
the
looser
fragments
of
the
rock
rear
boldly
in
the
air
its
lofty
head
while
struggling
with
the
stone
the
nervous
roots
pursued
their
own
direction
elbowing
out
their
flinty
neighbour
who
with
moss
of
varied
hues
and
deck
with
heath
that
from
each
fissure
hung
luxuriant
down
became
a
seat
where
king
of
all
the
scene
the
harper
sate
and
in
sweet
melodies
now
like
the
lark
rejoicing
at
the
dawn
now
soothing
as
the
nightingale
sad
note
hail
the
departing
sun
whose
golden
rays
glitter
upon
the
surface
of
the
wave
and
as
a
child
upon
its
mother
arm
seeks
to
delay
the
coming
hour
of
rest
till
sudden
slumbers
steal
upon
his
smiles
and
veil
him
in
a
dream
of
love
and
joy
he
seem
reluctant
to
withdraw
his
beams
and
rich
in
roseate
beauty
for
awhile
kept
the
green
waves
beneath
his
glowing
head
kind
gentle
osborne
half
a
century
has
silver
the
crisp
and
yellow
locks
of
thy
young
auditor
but
memory
still
grasps
the
torn
record
of
my
weary
life
and
finds
full
many
a
page
to
tell
of
thee
oh
ye
who
have
a
friend
ye
truly
love
one
whom
your
hearts
can
trust
whose
excellence
was
not
obtruded
boastingly
to
view
but
time
and
happy
circumstance
reveal
rays
of
quick
light
upon
a
diamond
which
else
had
lain
unnotic
in
the
waste
oh
hasten
hasten
speedily
to
pay
each
debt
of
fond
affection
lock
not
up
so
cautiously
the
tribute
due
to
worth
nor
let
reserve
as
i
have
often
done
enslave
the
sweetest
feelings
of
the
soul
and
hang
around
them
like
an
envious
mist
the
bright
radiance
of
the
morning
star
leaving
us
nothing
but
a
spot
of
light
bereav
of
all
its
lustre
for
my
friend
he
never
knew
that
there
was
one
on
earth
after
a
parent
felt
the
touch
of
death
and
love
a
weeping
pilgrim
turn
away
far
from
his
dwelling
oh
he
never
knew
that
there
was
one
who
would
have
follow
him
with
steady
kindness
even
to
the
grave
thou
dear
neglected
friend
to
whom
i
owe
all
that
sustains
my
heart
and
makes
me
think
the
gift
of
life
a
blessing
oh
forgive
that
in
thy
sorrows
my
forgetful
tongue
spake
not
of
zeal
and
service
of
the
debt
which
gratitude
was
emulous
to
pay
i
might
have
trimm
the
dying
lamp
of
hope
and
cheer
the
bitter
hours
of
banishment
but
oh
my
youth
was
fearful
and
i
felt
so
deep
an
awe
of
that
unspotted
worth
and
gentleness
such
a
mistrust
of
my
own
powers
to
tell
him
what
i
wish
that
i
resisted
all
my
feelings
claim
in
anguish
i
resisted
but
a
spell
hung
me
and
compell
me
to
be
mute
methinks
i
still
behold
him
tall
and
fair
he
had
a
look
so
tranquil
and
so
mild
that
something
holy
stole
upon
the
sense
when
he
appear
his
language
had
such
power
in
converse
that
the
hearer
as
entranced
sate
lingering
on
to
listen
while
in
song
or
skill
upon
the
harp
was
never
heard
his
equal
then
he
knew
all
our
old
ballads
all
our
father
tales
all
the
adventurous
deeds
of
early
times
the
punishment
of
blood
or
sacrilege
and
the
reward
of
virtue
when
it
deserted
by
the
world
and
left
alone
a
prey
to
scorn
oppression
contumely
and
all
the
ills
which
make
the
good
despair
we
circled
round
him
one
young
girl
was
always
present
of
a
nicer
ear
and
more
refin
perception
than
the
rest
now
she
was
lost
in
thought
while
on
her
cheek
lay
silent
tears
and
then
that
cheek
grew
pale
in
wild
amazement
but
when
he
began
to
speak
of
noble
deeds
she
rais
her
head
bending
with
looks
of
mingled
awe
and
love
and
zealous
admiration
on
the
youth
alone
insensible
of
all
around
to
the
soft
charm
of
symmetry
and
grace
the
smile
intelligent
the
look
benign
and
all
the
outward
raiment
of
the
soul
yet
though
he
saw
her
not
it
was
his
fate
to
have
an
inward
and
discerning
sense
which
spake
of
lora
gentleness
and
worth
he
lov
in
her
the
fondness
of
his
art
and
taught
her
many
wild
and
simple
airs
suiting
the
plaintive
tenor
of
her
voice
which
he
would
mimic
with
sweet
minstrelsy
when
she
was
absent
and
with
strange
delight
repeat
her
parting
words
her
kind
adieu
or
promise
of
return
and
that
return
was
prompt
she
linger
oft
till
evening
wet
the
ground
with
heavy
dew
or
came
to
take
her
lesson
in
the
morn
before
her
father
anxious
eyes
unclos
to
look
upon
her
beauty
with
delight
and
soothe
the
rugged
temper
of
his
soul
by
views
of
future
grandeur
for
his
child
not
thinking
that
her
elegance
of
mind
the
modest
dignity
of
humble
worth
which
fits
the
peasant
to
become
a
crowned
monarch
and
to
wield
with
grace
the
golden
sceptre
had
instructed
her
to
feel
no
paltry
jealousy
of
power
no
bold
aspiring
and
no
wish
beyond
the
bounded
confines
of
her
present
state
had
counsell
her
that
even
mines
of
wealth
could
purchase
nothing
to
content
the
wise
esteem
or
friendship
tenderness
or
love
that
power
at
best
was
but
a
heavy
weight
if
well
employ
a
dubious
unpaid
toil
if
ill
a
curse
to
tempt
men
to
their
fate
her
cheek
had
often
felt
the
blush
of
shame
at
his
proud
boasting
and
her
heart
had
sunk
at
the
cold
arrogance
that
scorn
the
poor
but
she
was
fain
to
turn
aside
and
weep
to
wring
her
hands
in
secret
and
to
raise
the
eye
of
silent
anguish
up
to
heaven
for
though
he
dearly
lov
her
he
would
submit
to
hear
a
murmur
at
his
will
oft
with
her
heart
oppress
and
her
blue
eyes
full
of
unshedden
tears
she
bent
her
way
alone
to
osborne
lowly
cot
and
when
her
faint
voice
call
the
fond
inquiry
forth
would
say
is
true
my
friends
that
i
am
sad
nay
sick
with
vain
repining
o
i
wish
that
i
were
either
indigent
myself
or
that
i
had
the
power
the
blessed
power
of
cheering
the
unhappy
for
i
want
by
kindness
to
prevent
the
act
of
guilt
and
ward
the
arrows
of
incroaching
death
who
comes
before
the
time
upon
his
prey
think
that
there
should
be
means
to
stay
his
wrath
to
purchase
health
life
comfort
innocence
and
yet
those
means
withholden
o
my
heart
it
dies
with
sorrow
and
where
most
i
love
sheds
all
its
bitterness
delighting
still
to
tell
the
many
miseries
that
flit
at
times
across
me
those
i
lightly
prize
partake
the
sunshine
of
my
happier
hours
although
i
seek
them
with
far
less
delight
the
loud
laugh
dwells
not
here
the
sportive
dance
the
carol
of
unconscious
levity
and
yet
how
oft
how
willingly
i
come
thou
not
lora
cried
the
youthful
sage
that
there
are
things
the
mind
must
prize
above
what
captivates
the
senses
that
in
them
she
feels
no
interest
and
she
takes
no
care
that
though
sometimes
an
alien
she
receives
delighted
back
the
ensigns
of
her
power
and
takes
her
truant
vassals
into
grace
that
when
thou
to
us
that
wounded
mind
the
grave
of
many
feelings
language
is
as
yet
too
poor
to
utter
thou
canst
give
no
richer
dearer
token
of
regard
were
man
indeed
the
only
hope
of
man
i
never
would
reprove
thee
for
thy
tears
but
they
are
vain
man
has
a
surer
trust
the
helpless
weary
miserable
wretch
left
by
his
fellows
in
the
wilderness
shall
be
supported
in
that
trying
hour
by
a
right
arm
which
in
his
days
of
strength
he
did
not
lean
upon
a
gracious
arm
which
wounds
the
sick
and
heals
them
by
the
stroke
o
lora
to
the
father
of
the
world
a
judge
so
patient
and
so
merciful
that
he
refuses
not
the
latest
sigh
nor
suffers
sorrow
but
as
means
to
save
canst
thou
not
trust
the
objects
of
thy
care
hadst
thou
the
power
to
help
them
it
were
well
to
be
most
anxious
to
collect
thy
freight
of
human
sorrow
and
by
merchandize
exchange
it
for
the
riches
of
the
world
for
health
for
comfort
nay
perchance
for
life
that
gem
of
countless
value
which
sometimes
not
all
the
treasures
of
the
east
can
buy
tendered
with
supplications
and
with
tears
is
often
purchas
at
a
petty
price
nay
in
exchange
for
courtesy
what
joy
must
in
that
moment
fill
the
merchant
heart
to
win
a
jewel
kings
monopolize
the
sole
disposal
of
be
patient
then
this
glorious
privilege
may
yet
be
thine
deserve
it
only
by
fulfilling
all
the
gentler
duties
that
have
present
claims
with
cheerfulness
and
zeal
let
no
neglect
press
on
thy
father
age
no
discontent
sour
thee
with
thy
companions
no
mistrust
give
pain
to
friendship
and
thy
usefulness
though
calm
and
bounded
has
no
mean
award
thus
like
a
prophet
did
he
still
enforce
only
the
virtues
and
rare
qualities
congenial
with
her
after
destiny
yet
not
foreseeing
evil
he
himself
was
unprepared
and
when
her
father
led
her
opposition
and
entreaty
past
the
hapless
lora
forth
to
promise
love
and
honour
to
a
man
whose
vacant
mind
throughout
a
course
of
long
succeeding
years
she
vainly
strove
to
soften
and
to
raise
though
he
had
taught
her
patience
till
that
hour
his
own
at
once
forsook
him
and
he
fled
she
murmur
not
nor
even
seem
to
mourn
but
losing
all
her
love
of
solitude
appear
so
active
in
each
new
pursuit
so
wholly
what
her
anxious
father
wish
that
he
repented
not
his
cruelty
believing
in
her
happiness
he
felt
himself
the
author
and
became
more
proud
of
his
own
wisdom
yet
she
often
heard
his
wayward
taunt
or
querulous
complaint
and
from
the
lordly
partner
of
her
fate
the
harsher
sound
of
ignorant
rebuke
she
was
a
matchless
woman
when
she
lost
the
timid
graces
of
retiring
youth
she
still
was
lovely
for
her
shaded
eyes
beam
with
a
lofty
sweetness
a
content
beyond
the
of
fortune
to
destroy
careless
of
let
or
hindrance
she
went
on
nor
shrunk
nor
started
at
the
many
thorns
strew
in
her
toilsome
path
still
looking
forth
to
others
weal
forgetful
it
would
seem
perchance
in
heart
despairing
of
her
own
the
friend
the
help
the
comforter
of
all
no
voice
was
heard
so
cheerful
nor
a
step
so
bounding
and
so
light
was
wonderful
for
i
have
seen
her
when
her
polish
arm
has
clasp
the
nurseling
with
her
face
bent
fondly
and
i
have
mark
each
limb
to

a
fine
expansion
as
if
with
the
deep
feelings
of
maternal
love
and
aching
tenderness
too
highly
wrought
for
happy
souls
to
cherish
they
delight
in
painless
joys
and
on
the
infant
cheek
rounded
and
glowing
with
a
finer
bloom
than
the
careless
imprint
the
kiss
which
sorrow
always
sanctions
by
a
prayer
they
in
the
radiance
of
its
glancing
eyes
see
nothing
to
suffuse
with
their
own
tears
borne
forward
on
the
easy
wing
of
time
they
travel
on
they
scarcely

or
like

summer
cloud
he
passes
by
his
shadow

one
instant

again
the

is
calm
and

as

not
so
with

trouble
sickness
death
were

with
the
residue
of
peace
when
years
and
care
had
weaken
her
regrets
veil
the
sad
recollection
of
past
days
and
overgrown
the
softness
of
her
mind
as
the
ivy
hides
and
rusts
the
smooth
and
silver
surface
of
the
beech
an
orphan
and
a
widow
she
became
decisive
watchful
prudent
nay
severe
to
wilful
disobedience
or
neglect
though
generous
where
she
perceiv
desert
she
taught
her
children
with
unceasing
zeal
sought
knowledge
for
their
sakes
and
more
than
all
anxious
inquisitive
about
the

search
all
the
motives
all
the
incidents
in
which
it
was
unfolded
fencing

by
constant
vigilance
till

age
had
fix
the
moral
sense
when
as
a
bow
for
a
long
active
season
tightly
relaxes
tumult
and
contention
she
sunk
into
indulgence
glad
to
yield
to
mildness
nature
and
herself
again
youth
when
wise
and
good
requires
a
change
delights
in
novelty
and
hears
of
nought
which
suddenly
it
asks
not
to
behold
and
lora
children
oft
assail
her
ear
to
let
them
journey
to
some
rumour
scene
some
feast
or
village
wake
or
sprightly
dance
urging
her
still
to
bear
them
company
she
lov
to
give
them
pleasure
and
one
time
the
legend
of
our
country
folk
hath
oft
the
tale
repeated
as
they
carelessly
in
the
crowd
remember
notes
struck
by
a
harper
in
a
distant
tent
sweet
and
as
the
midnight
songs
which
are
they
say
the
harbingers
of
death
flow
on
her
ear
when
with
impulsive
spring
as
if
a
magic
spell
had
wing
her
feet
fearing
the
sounds
would
vanish
into
air
and
prove
delusion
ere
she
reach
the
spot
she
forward
rush
and
soon
beheld
the
friend
the
dear
companion
of
her
youth
she
the
hand
that
lay
upon
the
quivering
chords
stopping
their
melody
and
resting
mute
the
pause
was
awful
he
at
length
exclaim
in
a
deep
laboured
cry
ye
heavenly
powers
if
lora
lives
the
hand
i
feel
is
hers
she
could
not
speak
but
with
her
other
hand
clasp
his
and
sigh
and
rais
her
eyes
to
heaven
when
straight
the
big
round
tears
began
to
flow
and
is
it
thee
dear
lora
art
thou
come
again
to
gladden
one
who
never
found
countless
who
are
good
a
heart
like
thine
oh
speak
that
i
may
know
if
still
my
ear
retains
a
true
remembrance
of
that
voice
for
since
it
has
not
drank
so
sweet
a
sound
hail
happy
day
cried
lora
which
restores
the
friend
whose
absence
i
have
mourn
so
long
for
thou
o

with
me
return
me
and
my

that
like

my
early
friend
with
us
thou
shalt
enjoy
repose
our
cheerful
home
shall
gather
round
thee
many
an

which
knows
thy
virtues

nature
decks

in
loveliness

below
spreads
the
green
valley
where
a
silent
stream
turns
like

in

kissing
heaven

noble
and

the

years
of

this
plain

her

succeeding

their

and
their
virtue

the
worth
of
both

they
are
wise
and
good

why

unassuming
as

moves
the
queen
of
night

i
am

the
pen
of
a

of
youth
i
wander
forth
amid
the
and
careless
sipp
the
morning
air
nor
hail
the
hours
nor
saw
that
happiness
was
there
alas
i
often
since
have
wept
that
gratitude
unconscious
slept
for
truth
and
pity
then
were
young
and
walk
in
simple
narrow
bounds

assuasive

most
capricious
sounds
once
wild
with
scornful
pride
she
fled
and
only
turn
to
seek
the
dead
oh
from
a
garden
of
delight
what
fair
memento
did
i
bring
what
amaranth
of
colours
bright
to
mark
the
promise
of
my

behold
this
its

wet
with

of
lasting
vain
regret

mournful

echo
of
my
woe
no
stranger
tread
in
this
lone
spot
i
fear
sweeter
thy
notes
in
such
wild
places
flow
and
what
is
more
my
henry
can
not
hear
he
will
not
know
my
pain
and
my
despair
when
that
dread
scene
arises
on
my
view
where
my
poor
father
would
not
hear
my
or
grant
his
only
child
a
last
adieu
he
will
not
know
that
still
the
hour
i
mourn
when
death
all
hopes
of
pardon
snatch
away
that
still
this
heart
by
sad
remembrance
torn
repeats
the
dreadful
mandate
of
that
day
luckless
for
him
has
been
my
constant
love
luckless
the
destiny
i
bade
him
brave
for
since
a
parent
did
our
vows
reprove
sorrow
was
all
the
gift
my
fondness
gave
then
though
i
knew
my
father
stern
command
the
conflict
of
affection
i
offer
to
the
youth
my
dowerless
hand
and
fondly
reason
thus
on
being
poor
pomp
or
splendour
elevate
the
soul
brighten
the
lustre
that
illumes
the
eye
make
the
rough
stream
of
life
more
smoothly
roll
suppress
the
tear
or
waft
away
the
sigh
happiness
a
purer
joy
receive
in
the
proud
mansions
of
the
rich
and
great
or
tell
me
can
the
wounded
bosom
heave
with
blunted
anguish
under
robes
of
state
henry
no
alas
too
well
you
know
the
misery
of
an
affected
smile
the
pain
of
clearing
the
brow
to
covet
for
yourself
the
hateful
toil
since
my
choice
and
reason
both
approve
since
i
have
known
you
many
a
circling
year
and
time
has
well
assur
me
of
your
love
tell
me
my
henry
what
have
i
to
fear
father
though
by
worldly
prudence
led
will
pardon
when
our
happiness
is
told
alas
no
curses
fell
upon
my
head
but
never
did
he
more
his
child
behold
he
would
not
dying
hear
my
ardent
prayer
but
cruel
said
i
leave
her
all
my
store
she
wrung
my
doating
heart
with
deep
despair
and
even
now
perhaps
desires
no
more
this
is
the
stroke
which
all
my
peace
destroys
the
dagger
which
no
art
can
draw
away
the
thought
which
every
faculty
employs
withers
my
bloom
and
makes
my
strength
decay
his
death
his
sorrows
are
the
heavy
curse
that
hangs
above
my
poor
distracted
head
his
dying
words
have
scatter
vain
remorse
for
vain
though
bitter
are
the
tears
i
shed
and
yet
my
father
to
my
soul
was
dear
but
tender
pity
was
on
henry
side
i
painted
him
relenting
not
severe
nor
fancied
i
could
be
an
orphan
bride
ah
me
excuses
will
not
cure
my
pain
at
least
forgetfulness
can
little
plead
a
widow
parent
i
deserv
disdain
is
fit
these
eyes
should
weep
this
heart
should
bleed
but
yet
assist
me
heaven
to
hide
my
grief
my
waning
health
from
love
suspicious
eyes
this
malady
admits
of
no
relief
and
nought
augments
the
pain
but
henry
sighs
perhaps
now
he
wonders
at
my
stay
sees
the
white
fogs
of
evening
rise
around
comes
out
to
seek
me
in
my
devious
way
but
turns
not
to
this
unfrequented
ground
alas
my
love
thy
anxious
care
is
vain
nothing
can
stop
yon
of
the
sky
nothing
can
long
this
fleeting
life
retain
for
oh
i
feel
that
i
must
shortly
die
but
cease
my
lute
this
low
desponding
strain
it
floats
too
long
upon
the
heavy
air
henry
may
pass
and
know
that
i
complain
one
moment
peace
to
him
is
worth
my
care
she
said
and
toward
the
cheerless
mansion
flew
her
slender
form
array
in
white
not
clearly
seen
amidst
surrounding
dew
seem
like
a
spirit
in
its
flight
poor
henry
who
had
watch
her
in
the
shade
in
aching
silence
to
her
song
at
distance
follow
slowly
through
the
glade
pausing
forgetful
as
he
pass
along
youth
unsuspicious
of
evil
o
bend
thy
head
sweet
morning
and
look
not
up
so
fresh
and
bright
the
keen
harsh
wind
the
heavy
will
spoil
thy
beauties
ere
the
night
i
grieve
to
see
thee
look
so
gay
and
so
unconscious
of
thy
lot
for
gloom
and
tempests
wait
thy
day
and
thou
unhappy
it
not
thy
tender
leaflets
all
unfold
their
colours
ripen
and
refine
become
most
lovely
to
behold
and
ah
most
apt
to
shrink
and
pine
then
bend
thy
head
sweet
morning
i
grieve
to
see
thee
look
so
gay
close
thy
soft
wings
against
the
and
wait
a
more
auspicious
day
the
mother
and
beats
my
heart
again
with
joy
and
dances
now
my
spirit
light
the
skiff
that
holds
my
darling
boy
this
moment
burst
upon
my
sight
not
yet
distinctly
i
perceive
amid
the
crew
his
form
but
still
his
safety
i
believe
i
know
he
has
escap
the
storm
i
feel
as
if
my
heart
had
wings
and
tender
from
excess
of
bliss
his
form
which
airy
fancy
brings
in
fond
emotion
seem
to
kiss
welcome
the
wild
imperfect
rest
which
these
bewilder
spirits
share
welcome
this
tumult
of
the
breast
after
the
shudder
of
despair
my
robert
he
is
brave
and
strong
he
will
these
flowing
tears
reprove
alas
how
little
know
the
young
the
tremor
of
a
mother
love
for
we
are
weak
from
many
a
care
from
many
a
sleepless
anxious
hour
when
fear
and
hope
the
bosom
tear
and
ride
the
brain
with
fevering
power
but
lo
he
cheerly
waves
his
hand
i
hear
his
voice
i
see
his
face
and
eager
now
he
springs
to
land
to
meet
a
mother
fond
embrace
this
failing
heart
but
joy
to
me
if
heaven
in
pity
is
thy
guard
and
of
the
pangs
i
feel
for
thee
protection
be
the
dear
reward
edgar
and
ellen
arrest
thy
steps
on
these
sad
plains
fair
dame
no
farther
go
but
listen
to
the
martial
strains
whose
wildness
speaks
of
woe
hark
strife
is
forward
on
the
field
i
hear
the
trumpet
bray
now
spear
to
spear
and
shield
to
shield
decides
the
dreadful
day
unfit
for
thee
oh
lady
fair
the
scenes
where
men
engage
thy
gentle
spirit
could
not
bear
the
fearful
battle
rage
i
prithee
stranger
let
me
fly
though
pallid
is
my
cheek
the
lightning
flash
delights
my
eye
i
love
the
thunder
break
and
oft
beneath
our
castle
when
tempests
rush
along
my
steady
hand
has
painted
flowers
or
voice
has
rais
the
song
oh
lady
that
bewilder
eye
is
red
with
recent
tears
already
that
sigh
proclaims
thy
anxious
fears
then
let
a
stranger
words
prevail
nor
thus
in
danger
roam
here
many
frightful
ills
assail
but
safety
is
at
home
no
in
some
peasant
lowly
cot
perhaps
she
may
abide
to
consecrate
the
humble
spot
but
not
where
i
reside
in
hubert
halls
my
father
foe
from
childhood
have
i
dwelt
and
for
his
wily
murderer
too
a
filial
fondness
felt
ah
me
how
often
have
i
the
lips
which
seal
his
doom
how
oft
the
cruel
hand
which
sent
him
to
the
tomb
my
nurse
reveal
the
dreadful
truth
and
as
she
told
the
tale
a
sickly
blight
pass
my
youth
and
turn
its
roses
pale
the
heavy
secret
on
my
heart
like
deadly
poison
prey
for
she
forbade
me
to
impart
a
word
of
what
she
said
i
who
so
blithely
sung
before
so
peacefully
had
slept
fancied
gaunt
murder
at
the
door
and
listen
shook
and
wept
no
longer
with
an
open
smile
i
greeted
all
around
my
fearful
looks
were
fix
the
while
in
terror
on
the
ground
all
saw
the
change
and
kindly
strove
my
sadness
to
relieve
base
hubert
feign
a
parent
love
which
could
not
see
me
grieve
a
painful
anger
flush
my
cheek
my
lip
indignant
smil
i
cried
and
did
he
bespeak
thy
friendship
for
his
child
ellen
when
death
was
drawing
nigh
thou
wert
his
only
care
oh
guard
her
hubert
if
i
die
it
is
my
latest
prayer
to
none
dear
friend
but
thee
he
cried
whose
love
and
truth
are
known
could
i
this
precious
charge
confide
to
cherish
as
thy
own
i
pledg
my
honour
to
fulfil
my
dearest
friend
desire
and
i
have
ever
acted
still
as
honour
laws
require
thy
mind
dear
ellen
is
the
proof
of
my
paternal
care
since
form
beneath
this
friendly
roof
so
excellent
and
fair
then
why
that
cloud
upon
thy
brow
that
sullen
fearful
sigh
that
something
which
we
must
not
know
that
cold
and
altered
eye
why
must
thy
proud
suspicious
air
give
every
heart
a
pain
why
must
my
son
my
edgar
bear
unmerited
disdain
i
hung
my
bead
my
tongue
in
feeble
murmurs
spoke
his
specious
art
my
bosom
wrung
i
shudder
at
his
look
and
thus
bewildered
with
my
woes
i
faint
and
careless
rove
for
oh
i
can
not
dwell
with
those
i
must
no
longer
love
fair
lady
calm
that
anxious
heart
and
to
my
voice
attend
thy
father
died
by
hubert
dart
and
yet
he
was
his
friend
for
lancaster
sir
philip
rose
and
many
a
yorkist
slew
till
singling
him
amidst
his
foes
lord
hubert
arrow
flew
but
soon
we
saw
the
victor
stand
beside
in
sorrow
drown
and
soon
sir
philip
took
the
hand
which
gave
the
deadly
wound
my
friend
unweeting
was
thy
aim
and
is
by
me
but
oh
one
sacred
oath
i
claim
in
sight
of
men
and
oh
promise
with
a
father
zeal
my
ellen
to
protect
nor
let
her
like
an
orphan
feel
dependence
and
neglect
and
then
almost
without
regret
i
can
my
charge
resign
for
during
life
i
never
met
so
true
a
heart
as
thine
lord
hubert
pledg
his
sacred
word
he
wept
and
kneeling
swore
in
england
to
wield
a
sword
or
shoot
an
arrow
more
from
civil
war
whose
daily
crimes
this
