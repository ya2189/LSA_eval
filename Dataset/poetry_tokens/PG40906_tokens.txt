what
look

look

gawaine
so
dagonet
whom
arthur
made
a
knight
because
he
loved
him
as
he
laughed
at
him
intoned
his
idle
presence
on
a
day
to
gawaine
who
had
thought
himself
alone
had
there
been
in
him
thought
of
anything
save
what
was
murmured
now
in
camelot
of
merlin
hushed
and
all
but
unconfirmed
appearance
out
of
brittany
it
was
heard
at
first
there
was
a
ghost
in
arthur
palace
but
soon
among
the
scullions
and
anon
among
the
knights
a
firmer
credit
held
all
tongues
from
uttering
what
all
glances
told
though
not
for
long
gawaine
this
afternoon
fearing
he
might
say
more
to
lancelot
of
merlin
resurrection
than
lancelot
would
have
an
ear
to
cherish
had
sauntered
off
with
his
imagination
to
merlin
rock
where
now
there
was
no
merlin
to
meditate
upon
a
whispering
town
below
him
in
the
once
he
said
to
gawaine
you
are
young
and
that
being
so
behold
the
shining
city
of
our
dreams
and
of
our
king
long
live
the
king
said
long
live
the
king
said
merlin
after
him
better
for
me
that
i
shall
not
be
king
wherefore
i
say
again
long
live
the
king
and
add
god
save
him
also
and
all
kings
all
kings
and
queens
i
speak
in
general
kings
have
i
known
that
were
but
weary
men
with
no
stout
appetite
for
more
than
peace
that
was
not
made
for
them
nor
were
they
made
for
kings
gawaine
said
you
are
young
gawaine
and
you
may
one
day
hold
the
world
between
your
fingers
knowing
not
what
it
is
that
you
are
holding
better
for
you
and
me
i
think
that
we
shall
not
be
kings
gawaine
remembering
merlin
words
of
long
ago
frowned
as
he
thought
and
having
frowned
again
he
smiled
and
threw
an
acorn
at
a
lizard
there
more
afoot
and
in
the
air
than
what
is
good
for
camelot
merlin
may
or
may
not
know
all
but
he
said
well
to
say
to
me
that
he
would
not
be
king
no
more
would
i
be
king
far
down
he
gazed
on
camelot
until
he
made
of
it
a
phantom
town
of
many
stillnesses
not
reared
for
men
to
dwell
in
or
for
kings
to
reign
in
without
omens
and
obscure
familiars
to
bring
terror
to
their
days
for
though
a
knight
and
one
as
hard
at
arms
as
any
save
the
few
that
all
acknowledged
or
in
envy
loathed
he
felt
a
foreign
sort
of
creeping
up
and
down
him
as
of
moist
things
in
the
dark
when
dagonet
coming
on
him
unawares
presuming
on
his
title
of
sir
fool
addressed
him
and
crooned
on
till
he
was
done
what
look
ye
for
to
see
gawaine
gawaine
sir
dagonet
you
best
and
wariest
of
all
dishonest
men
i
look
through
time
for
sight
of
what
it
is
that
is
to
be
i
look
to
see
it
though
i
see
it
not
i
see
a
town
down
there
that
holds
a
king
and
over
it
i
see
a
few
small
clouds
like
feathers
in
the
west
as
you
observe
and
i
shall
see
no
more
this
afternoon
than
what
there
is
around
us
every
day
unless
you
have
a
skill
that
i
have
not
to
ferret
the
invisible
for
rats
if
you
see
what
around
us
every
day
you
need
no
other
showing
to
go
mad
remember
that
and
take
it
home
with
you
and
say
tonight
had
it
of
a
fool
with
no
immediate
obliquity
for
this
one
or
for
that
one
or
for
me
gawaine
having
risen
eyed
the
fool
curiously
i
not
forget
i
had
it
of
a
knight
whose
only
folly
is
to
fool
himself
and
as
for
making
other
men
to
laugh
and
so
forget
their
sins
and
selves
a
little
there
no
great
folly
there
so
keep
it
up
as
long
as
you
a
legend
or
a
song
and
have
whatever
sport
of
us
you
like
till
havoc
is
the
word
and
we
fall
howling
for
i
a
guess
there
may
not
be
so
loud
a
sound
of
laughing
here
in
camelot
when
merlin
goes
again
to
his
gay
grave
in
brittany
to
mention
lesser
terrors
men
say
his
beard
is
gone
do
men
say
that
a
twitch
of
an
impatient
weariness
played
for
a
moment
over
the
lean
face
of
dagonet
who
reasoned
inwardly
the
friendly
zeal
of
this
inquiring
knight
will
overtake
his
tact
and
leave
it
squealing
one
of
these
days
gawaine
looked
hard
at
him
if
i
be
too
familiar
with
a
fool
i
on
the
way
to
be
another
fool
he
mused
and
owned
a
rueful
qualm
within
him
yes
dagonet
he
ventured
with
a
laugh
men
tell
me
that
his
beard
has
vanished
wholly
and
that
he
shines
now
as
the
lord
anointed
and
wears
the
valiance
of
an
ageless
youth
crowned
with
a
glory
of
eternal
peace
dagonet
smiling
strangely
shook
his
head
i
grant
your
valiance
of
a
kind
of
youth
to
merlin
but
your
crown
of
peace
i
question
for
though
i
know
no
more
than
any
churl
who
pinches
any
chambermaid
soever
in
the
king
palace
i
look
not
to
merlin
for
peace
when
out
of
his
peculiar
tomb
he
comes
again
to
camelot
time
swings
a
mighty
scythe
and
some
day
all
your
peace
goes
down
before
its
edge
like
so
much
clover
no
it
is
not
for
peace
that
merlin
comes
without
a
trumpet
and
without
a
beard
if
what
you
say
men
say
of
him
be
true
nor
yet
for
sudden
war
gawaine
for
a
moment
met
then
the
ambiguous
gaze
of
dagonet
and
making
nothing
of
it
looked
abroad
as
if
at
something
cheerful
on
all
sides
and
back
again
to
the
fool
unasking
eyes
well
dagonet
if
merlin
would
have
peace
let
merlin
stay
away
from
brittany
said
he
with
admiration
for
the
man
whom
folly
called
a
fool
and
we
have
known
him
we
knew
him
once
when
he
knew
everything
he
knew
as
much
as
god
would
let
him
know
until
he
met
the
lady
vivian
i
tell
you
that
for
the
world
knows
all
that
also
it
knows
he
told
the
king
one
day
that
he
was
to
be
buried
and
alive
in
brittany
and
that
the
king
should
see
the
face
of
him
no
more
then
merlin
sailed
away
to
vivian
in
broceliande
where
now
she
crowns
him
and
herself
with
flowers
and
feeds
him
fruits
and
wines
and
many
foods
of
many
savors
and
sweet
ortolans
wise
books
of
every
lore
of
every
land
are
there
to
fill
his
days
if
he
require
them
and
there
are
players
of
all
instruments
flutes
hautboys
drums
and
viols
and
she
sings
to
merlin
till
he
trembles
in
her
arms
and
there
forgets
that
any
town
alive
had
ever
such
a
name
as
camelot
so
vivian
holds
him
with
her
love
they
say
and
he
who
has
no
age
has
not
grown
old
i
swear
to
nothing
but
that
what
they
say
that
being
buried
in
broceliande
for
too
much
wisdom
and
clairvoyancy
but
you
and
all
who
live
gawaine
have
heard
this
tale
or
many
like
it
more
than
once
and
you
must
know
that
love
when
love
invites
philosophy
to
play
plays
high
and
wins
or
low
and
loses
and
you
say
to
me
merlin
would
have
peace
let
merlin
stay
away
from
brittany
gawaine
you
are
young
and
merlin
in
his
grave
merlin
said
once
that
i
was
young
and
it
a
joy
for
me
that
i
am
here
to
listen
while
you
say
it
young
or
not
young
if
that
be
burial
may
i
be
buried
long
before
i
die
i
might
be
worse
than
young
i
might
be
old
dagonet
answered
and
without
a
smile
somehow
i
fancy
merlin
saying
that
a
fancy
a
mere
fancy
then
he
smiled
and
such
a
doom
as
his
may
be
for
you
gawaine
should
your
untiring
divination
delve
in
the
veiled
eternal
mysteries
too
far
to
be
a
pleasure
for
the
lord
and
when
you
stake
your
wisdom
for
a
woman
compute
the
woman
to
be
worth
a
grave
as
merlin
did
and
say
no
more
about
it
but
vivian
she
played
high
oh
very
high
flutes
hautboys
drums
and
viols
and
her
love
gawaine
farewell
farewell
sir
dagonet
and
may
the
devil
take
you
presently
he
followed
with
a
vexed
and
envious
eye
and
with
an
arid
laugh
sir
departure
till
his
gaunt
obscurity
was
cloaked
and
lost
amid
the
glimmering
trees
poor
fool
he
murmured
or
am
i
the
fool
with
all
my
fast
ascendency
in
arms
that
ominous
clown
is
nearer
to
the
king
than
i
am
yet
and
god
knows
what
he
knows
and
what
his
wits
infer
from
what
he
sees
and
feels
and
hears
i
wonder
what
he
knows
of
lancelot
or
what
i
might
know
now
could
i
have
sunk
myself
to
sound
a
fool
to
springe
a
friend
no
i
like
not
this
day
there
a
cloud
coming
over
camelot
larger
than
any
that
is
in
the
sky
or
merlin
would
be
still
in
brittany
with
vivian
and
the
viols
it
all
too
strange
and
later
when
descending
to
the
city
through
unavailing
casements
he
could
hear
the
roaring
of
a
mighty
voice
within
confirming
fervidly
his
own
conviction
it
all
too
strange
and
half
the
world
half
crazy
he
scowled
well
i
agree
with
lamorak
he
frowned
and
passed
and
i
like
not
this
day
ii
sir
lamorak
the
man
of
oak
and
iron
had
with
him
now
as
a
guest
sir
bedivere
a
man
whom
arthur
loved
as
he
had
loved
no
man
save
lancelot
like
one
whose
shaft
of
argument
had
glanced
and
fallen
afield
innocuously
he
turned
upon
his
host
a
sudden
eye
that
met
from
lamorak
an
even
shaft
of
native
and
unused
authority
and
each
man
held
the
other
till
at
length
each
turned
away
shutting
his
heavy
jaws
again
together
prisoning
thus
two
tongues
that
might
forget
and
might
not
be
forgiven
then
bedivere
to
find
a
plain
way
out
said
lamorak
let
us
drink
to
some
one
here
and
end
this
dryness
who
shall
it
be
the
king
the
queen
or
lancelot
merlin
lamorak
growled
and
then
there
were
more
wrinkles
round
his
eyes
than
bedivere
had
said
were
possible
there
no
refusal
in
me
now
for
that
the
guest
replied
so
let
it
be
we
not
yet
seen
him
but
if
he
be
here
and
even
if
he
should
not
be
here
say
they
drank
to
the
unseen
from
two
new
tankards
and
fell
straightway
to
sighing
for
the
past
and
what
was
yet
before
them
silence
laid
a
cogent
finger
on
the
lips
of
each
impatient
veteran
whose
hard
hands
lay
clenched
and
restless
on
his
midriff
until
words
were
stronger
than
strong
lamorak
bedivere
began
the
solid
host
you
may
as
well
say
now
as
at
another
time
hereafter
that
all
your
certainties
have
bruises
on
and
all
your
pestilent
asseverations
will
never
make
a
man
a
salamander
who
born
as
we
are
told
so
fire
wo
bite
him
or
a
slippery
queen
a
nun
who
counts
and
burns
herself
to
nothing
with
her
beads
and
candles
there
nature
and
what
in
us
to
be
sifted
before
we
know
ourselves
or
any
man
or
woman
that
god
suffers
to
be
born
that
how
i
speak
and
while
you
strain
your
mazzard
like
father
jove
big
with
a
new
minerva
we
say
to
pass
the
time
that
i
speak
well
god
fish
the
king
had
eyes
and
lancelot
wo
ride
home
to
his
mother
for
she
dead
the
story
is
that
merlin
warned
the
king
of
what
come
now
to
pass
and
i
believe
it
and
arthur
he
being
arthur
and
a
king
has
made
a
more
pernicious
mess
than
one
we
told
for
being
so
great
and
amorous
it
that
unwholesome
and
inclement
cub
young
modred
i
see
first
in
hell
before
i
hang
too
high
the
queen
or
lancelot
the
king
if
one
may
say
it
set
the
pace
and
we
two
strapping
bastards
here
to
prove
it
young
borre
he
well
enough
but
as
for
modred
i
squirm
as
often
as
i
look
at
him
and
there
again
did
merlin
warn
the
king
the
story
goes
abroad
and
i
believe
it
sir
bedivere
as
one
who
caught
no
more
than
what
he
would
of
lamorak
outpouring
inclined
his
grizzled
head
and
closed
his
eyes
before
he
sighed
and
rubbed
his
beard
and
spoke
for
all
i
know
to
make
it
otherwise
the
queen
may
be
a
nun
some
day
or
other
i
pray
to
god
for
such
a
thing
to
be
if
prayer
for
that
were
not
a
mockery
we
late
now
for
much
praying
lamorak
when
you
and
i
can
feel
upon
our
faces
a
wind
that
has
been
blowing
over
ruins
that
we
had
said
were
castles
and
high
towers
till
merlin
or
the
spirit
of
him
came
as
the
dead
come
in
dreams
i
saw
the
king
this
morning
and
i
saw
his
face
therefore
i
tell
you
if
a
state
shall
have
a
king
the
king
must
have
the
state
and
be
the
state
or
then
shall
we
have
neither
king
nor
state
but
bones
and
ashes
and
high
towers
all
fallen
and
we
shall
have
where
late
there
was
a
kingdom
a
dusty
wreck
of
what
was
once
a
glory
a
wilderness
whereon
to
crouch
and
mourn
and
moralize
or
else
to
build
once
more
for
something
better
or
for
something
worse
therefore
again
i
say
that
lancelot
has
wrought
a
potent
wrong
upon
the
king
and
all
who
serve
and
recognize
the
king
and
all
who
follow
him
and
all
who
love
him
whatever
the
stormy
faults
he
may
have
had
to
look
on
him
today
is
to
forget
them
and
if
it
be
too
late
for
sorrow
now
to
save
him
for
it
was
a
broken
man
i
saw
this
morning
and
a
broken
king
the
god
who
sets
a
day
for
desolation
will
not
forsake
him
in
avilion
or
whatsoever
shadowy
land
there
be
where
peace
awaits
him
on
its
healing
shores
sir
lamorak
shifting
in
his
oaken
chair
growled
like
a
dog
and
shook
himself
like
one
for
the
knight
that
you
are
known
to
be
from
lyonnesse
to
northward
bedivere
you
when
days
are
rancid
and
you
more
like
a
woman
than
a
man
with
hands
fit
for
the
smiting
of
a
crazy
giant
with
armor
an
inch
thick
as
we
all
know
you
are
when
you
not
sermonizing
at
us
as
for
the
king
i
say
the
king
no
doubt
is
angry
sorry
and
all
sorts
of
things
for
lancelot
and
for
his
easy
queen
whom
he
took
knowing
she
thrown
sparks
already
on
that
same
piece
of
tinder
lancelot
who
fetched
her
with
him
from
leodogran
because
the
king
god
save
poor
human
reason
would
prove
to
merlin
who
knew
everything
worth
knowing
in
those
days
that
he
was
wrong
i
drink
now
and
be
quiet
but
by
god
i
have
to
tell
you
brother
bedivere
once
more
to
make
you
listen
properly
that
crowns
and
orders
and
high
palaces
and
all
the
manifold
ingredients
of
this
good
solid
kingdom
where
we
sit
and
spit
now
at
each
other
with
our
eyes
will
not
go
rolling
down
to
hell
just
yet
because
a
pretty
woman
is
a
fool
and
here
kay
coming
with
his
fiddle
face
as
long
now
as
two
fiddles
sit
ye
down
sir
man
and
tell
us
everything
you
know
of
merlin
or
his
ghost
without
a
beard
what
mostly
is
it
sir
kay
the
seneschal
sat
wearily
while
he
gazed
upon
the
two
to
you
it
mostly
is
if
i
err
not
that
what
you
hear
of
merlin
coming
back
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
heavy
truth
but
ask
me
nothing
of
the
queen
i
say
for
i
know
nothing
all
i
know
of
her
is
what
her
eyes
have
told
the
silences
that
now
attend
her
and
that
her
estate
is
one
for
less
complacent
execration
than
quips
and
innuendoes
of
the
city
would
augur
for
her
sin
if
there
be
sin
or
for
her
name
if
now
she
have
a
name
and
where
i
say
is
this
to
lead
the
king
and
after
him
the
kingdom
and
ourselves
here
be
we
three
men
of
a
certain
strength
and
some
confessed
intelligence
who
know
that
merlin
has
come
out
of
brittany
out
of
his
grave
as
he
would
say
it
for
us
because
the
king
has
now
a
desperation
more
strong
upon
him
than
a
woman
net
was
over
merlin
for
now
merlin
here
and
two
of
us
who
knew
him
know
how
well
his
wisdom
if
he
have
it
any
longer
will
by
this
hour
have
sounded
and
appraised
the
grief
and
wrath
and
anguish
of
the
king
requiring
mercy
and
inspiring
fear
lest
he
forego
the
vigil
now
most
urgent
and
leave
unwatched
a
cranny
where
some
worm
or
serpent
may
come
in
to
speculate
i
know
your
worm
and
his
worm
name
is
modred
albeit
the
streets
are
not
yet
saying
so
said
lamorak
as
he
lowered
his
wrath
and
laughed
a
sort
of
poisonous
apology
to
kay
and
in
the
meantime
i
be
gyved
here
bedivere
for
the
king
and
you
kay
with
a
moist
eye
for
the
queen
i
think
i
blow
a
horn
for
lancelot
for
by
my
soul
a
man
in
sorry
case
when
guineveres
are
out
with
eyes
to
scorch
him
i
not
so
ancient
or
so
frozen
certain
that
i
ride
horses
down
to
skeletons
if
she
were
after
me
has
merlin
seen
him
this
lancelot
this
friend
of
ours
kay
answered
sighing
with
a
lonely
scowl
the
picture
that
i
conjure
leaves
him
out
the
king
and
merlin
are
this
hour
together
and
i
can
say
no
more
for
i
know
nothing
but
how
the
king
persuaded
or
beguiled
the
stricken
wizard
from
across
the
water
outriddles
my
poor
wits
it
all
too
strange
it
all
too
strange
and
half
the
world
half
crazy
roared
lamorak
forgetting
once
again
the
devastating
carriage
of
his
voice
is
the
king
sick
he
said
more
quietly
is
he
to
let
one
damned
scratch
be
enough
to
paralyze
the
force
that
heretofore
would
operate
a
way
through
hell
and
iron
and
iron
already
slimy
with
his
blood
is
the
king
blind
with
modred
watching
him
does
he
forget
the
crown
for
lancelot
does
he
forget
that
every
woman
mewing
shall
some
day
be
a
handful
of
small
ashes
you
speak
as
one
for
whom
the
god
of
love
has
yet
a
mighty
trap
in
preparation
we
know
you
lamorak
said
bedivere
we
know
you
for
a
short
man
lamorak
in
deeds
if
not
in
inches
or
in
words
but
there
are
fens
and
heights
and
distances
that
your
capricious
ranging
has
not
yet
essayed
in
this
weird
region
of
man
love
forgive
me
lamorak
but
your
words
are
words
your
deeds
are
what
they
are
and
ages
hence
will
men
remember
your
illustriousness
if
there
be
gratitude
in
history
for
me
i
see
the
shadow
of
the
end
wherein
to
serve
king
arthur
to
the
end
and
if
god
have
it
so
to
see
the
grail
before
i
die
but
lamorak
shook
his
head
see
what
you
will
or
what
you
may
for
me
i
see
no
other
than
a
stinking
mess
with
modred
stirring
it
and
agravaine
spattering
camelot
with
as
much
of
it
as
he
can
throw
the
devil
got
somehow
into
god
workshop
once
upon
a
time
and
out
of
the
red
clay
that
he
found
there
he
made
a
shape
like
modred
and
another
as
like
as
eyes
are
to
this
agravaine
never
made
said
the
good
lord
god
let
go
and
see
what
comes
of
and
that
what
we
to
do
as
for
the
grail
i
never
worried
it
and
so
the
grail
has
never
worried
me
kay
sighed
i
see
with
bedivere
the
coming
of
the
end
he
murmured
for
the
king
i
saw
today
was
not
nor
shall
he
ever
be
again
the
king
we
knew
i
say
the
king
is
dead
the
man
is
living
but
the
king
is
dead
the
wheel
is
broken
tut
said
lamorak
there
are
no
dead
kings
yet
in
camelot
but
there
is
modred
who
is
hatching
ruin
and
when
it
hatches
i
may
not
be
here
there
gawaine
too
and
he
does
not
forget
my
father
who
killed
his
king
arthur
house
has
more
division
in
it
than
i
like
in
houses
and
if
modred
aim
be
good
for
backs
like
mine
i
not
long
for
the
scene
iii
king
arthur
as
he
paced
a
lonely
floor
that
rolled
a
muffled
echo
as
he
fancied
all
through
the
palace
and
out
through
the
world
might
now
have
wondered
hard
could
he
have
heard
sir
lamorak
apathetic
disregard
of
what
fate
knocking
made
so
manifest
and
ominous
to
others
near
the
king
if
any
indeed
were
near
him
at
this
hour
save
merlin
once
the
wisest
of
all
men
and
weary
dagonet
whom
he
had
made
a
knight
for
love
of
him
and
his
abused
integrity
he
might
have
wondered
hard
and
wondered
much
and
after
wondering
he
might
have
summoned
with
as
little
heart
as
he
had
now
for
crowns
the
fond
lost
merlin
whose
nemesis
had
made
of
him
a
slave
a
man
of
dalliance
and
a
sybarite
men
change
in
brittany
merlin
said
the
king
and
even
his
grief
had
strife
to
freeze
again
a
dreary
smile
for
the
transmuted
seer
now
robed
in
heavy
wealth
of
purple
silk
with
frogs
and
foreign
tassels
on
his
face
too
smooth
now
for
a
wizard
or
a
sage
lay
written
for
the
king
remembering
eyes
a
pathos
of
a
lost
authority
long
faded
and
unconscionably
gone
and
on
the
king
heart
lay
a
sudden
cold
i
might
as
well
have
left
him
in
his
grave
as
he
would
say
it
saying
what
was
true
as
death
is
true
this
merlin
is
not
mine
but
vivian
my
crown
is
less
than
hers
and
i
am
less
than
woman
to
this
man
then
merlin
as
one
reading
arthur
words
on
viewless
tablets
in
the
air
before
him
now
arthur
since
you
are
a
child
of
mine
a
and
that
a
kind
of
child
be
not
from
hearsay
or
despair
too
eager
to
dash
your
meat
with
bitter
seasoning
so
none
that
are
more
famished
than
yourself
shall
have
what
you
refuse
for
you
are
king
and
if
you
starve
yourself
you
starve
the
state
and
then
by
sundry
looks
and
silences
of
those
you
loved
and
by
the
lax
regard
of
those
you
knew
for
fawning
enemies
you
may
learn
soon
that
you
are
king
no
more
but
a
slack
blasted
and
man
made
sadder
with
a
crown
no
other
friend
than
i
could
say
this
to
you
and
say
more
and
if
you
bid
me
say
no
more
so
be
it
the
king
who
sat
with
folded
arms
now
bowed
his
head
and
felt
unfought
and
all
aflame
like
immanent
the
wretchedness
that
only
those
who
are
to
lead
may
feel
and
only
they
when
they
are
maimed
and
worn
too
sore
to
covet
without
shuddering
the
fixed
impending
eminence
where
death
itself
were
victory
could
they
but
lead
unbitten
by
the
serpents
they
had
fed
turning
he
spoke
merlin
you
say
the
truth
there
is
no
man
who
could
say
more
to
me
today
or
say
so
much
to
me
and
live
but
you
are
merlin
still
or
part
of
him
i
did
you
wrong
when
i
thought
otherwise
and
i
am
sorry
now
say
what
you
will
we
are
alone
and
i
shall
be
alone
as
long
as
time
shall
hide
a
reason
here
for
me
to
stay
in
this
infested
world
where
i
have
sinned
and
erred
and
heeded
not
your
counsel
and
where
you
yourself
god
save
us
have
gone
down
smiling
to
the
smaller
life
that
you
and
your
incongruous
laughter
called
your
living
grave
god
save
us
all
merlin
when
you
the
seer
the
founder
and
the
prophet
may
throw
the
gold
of
your
immortal
treasure
back
to
the
god
that
gave
it
and
then
laugh
because
a
woman
has
you
in
her
arms
why
do
you
sting
me
now
with
a
small
hive
of
words
that
are
all
poison
i
do
not
ask
much
honey
but
why
poison
me
for
nothing
and
with
a
venom
that
i
know
already
as
i
know
crowns
and
wars
why
tell
a
king
a
poor
foiled
flouted
miserable
king
that
if
he
lets
rats
eat
his
fingers
off
he
have
no
fingers
to
fight
battles
with
i
know
as
much
as
that
for
i
am
still
a
king
who
thought
himself
a
little
less
than
god
a
king
who
built
him
palaces
on
sand
and
mud
and
hears
them
crumbling
now
and
sees
them
tottering
as
he
knew
they
must
you
are
the
man
who
made
me
to
be
king
therefore
say
anything
merlin
stricken
deep
with
pity
that
was
old
being
born
of
old
foreshadowings
made
answer
to
the
king
this
coil
of
lancelot
and
guinevere
is
not
for
any
mortal
to
undo
or
to
deny
or
to
make
otherwise
but
your
most
violent
years
are
on
their
way
to
days
and
to
a
sounding
of
loud
hours
that
are
to
strike
for
war
let
not
the
time
between
this
hour
and
then
be
lost
in
fears
or
told
in
obscurations
and
vain
faith
in
what
has
been
your
long
security
for
should
your
force
be
slower
then
than
hate
and
your
regret
be
sharper
than
your
sight
and
your
remorse
fall
heavier
than
your
sword
then
say
farewell
to
camelot
and
the
crown
but
say
not
you
have
lost
or
failed
in
aught
your
golden
horoscope
of
imperfection
has
held
in
starry
words
that
i
have
read
i
see
no
farther
now
than
i
saw
then
for
no
man
shall
be
given
of
everything
together
in
one
life
yet
i
may
say
the
time
is
imminent
when
he
shall
come
for
whom
i
founded
the
siege
perilous
and
he
shall
be
too
much
a
living
part
of
what
he
brings
and
what
he
burns
away
in
to
be
for
long
a
vexed
inhabitant
of
this
mad
realm
of
stains
and
lower
trials
and
here
the
ways
of
god
again
are
mixed
for
this
new
knight
who
is
to
find
the
grail
for
you
and
for
the
least
who
pray
for
you
in
such
lost
coombs
and
hollows
of
the
world
as
you
have
never
entered
is
to
be
the
son
of
him
you
trusted
lancelot
of
all
who
ever
jeopardized
a
throne
sure
the
most
saving
one
your
son
begotten
though
you
knew
not
then
your
leman
was
your
sister
of
morgause
for
it
is
modred
now
not
lancelot
whose
native
hate
plans
your
annihilation
though
he
may
smile
till
he
be
sick
and
swear
allegiance
to
an
unforgiven
father
until
at
last
he
shake
an
empty
tongue
talked
out
with
too
much
lying
though
his
lies
will
have
a
truth
to
steer
them
trust
him
not
for
unto
you
the
father
he
the
son
is
like
enough
to
be
the
last
of
terrors
if
in
a
field
of
time
that
looms
to
you
far
larger
than
it
is
you
fail
to
plant
and
harvest
the
old
seeds
of
what
i
say
and
so
be
nourished
and
adept
again
for
what
may
come
to
be
but
lancelot
will
have
you
first
and
you
need
starve
no
more
for
the
queen
love
the
love
that
never
was
your
queen
is
now
your
kingdom
and
hereafter
let
no
man
take
it
from
you
or
you
die
let
no
man
take
it
from
you
for
a
day
for
days
are
long
when
we
are
far
from
what
we
love
and
mischief
other
name
is
distance
let
that
be
all
for
i
can
say
no
more
not
even
to
blaise
the
hermit
were
he
living
could
i
say
more
than
i
have
given
you
now
to
hear
and
he
alone
was
my
confessor
the
king
arose
and
paced
the
floor
again
i
get
gray
comfort
of
dark
words
he
said
but
tell
me
not
that
you
can
say
no
more
you
can
for
i
can
hear
you
saying
it
yet
i
not
ask
for
more
i
have
enough
until
my
new
knight
comes
to
prove
and
find
the
promise
and
the
glory
of
the
grail
though
i
shall
see
no
grail
for
i
have
built
on
sand
and
mud
and
i
shall
see
no
grail
nor
i
said
merlin
once
i
dreamed
of
it
but
i
was
buried
i
shall
see
no
grail
nor
would
i
have
it
otherwise
i
saw
too
much
and
that
was
never
good
for
man
the
man
who
goes
alone
too
far
goes
mad
in
one
way
or
another
god
knew
best
and
he
knows
what
is
coming
yet
for
me
i
do
not
ask
like
you
i
have
enough
that
night
king
arthur
apprehension
found
in
merlin
an
obscure
and
restive
guest
whose
only
thought
was
on
the
hour
of
dawn
when
he
should
see
the
last
of
camelot
and
ride
again
for
brittany
and
what
words
were
said
before
the
king
was
left
alone
were
only
darker
for
reiteration
they
parted
all
provision
made
secure
for
merlin
early
convoy
to
the
coast
and
arthur
tramped
the
past
the
loneliness
of
kings
around
him
like
the
unseen
dead
lay
everywhere
and
he
was
loath
to
move
as
if
in
fear
to
meet
with
his
cold
hand
the
touch
of
something
colder
then
a
whim
begotten
of
intolerable
doubt
seized
him
and
stung
him
until
he
was
asking
if
any
longer
lived
among
his
knights
a
man
to
trust
as
once
he
trusted
all
and
lancelot
more
than
all
and
it
is
he
who
is
to
have
me
first
so
merlin
says
as
if
he
had
me
not
in
hell
already
lancelot
lancelot
he
cursed
the
tears
that
cooled
his
misery
and
then
he
asked
himself
again
if
he
had
one
to
trust
among
his
knights
till
even
bedivere
tor
bors
and
percival
rough
lamorak
griflet
and
gareth
and
gay
gawaine
all
were
dubious
knaves
or
they
were
like
to
be
for
cause
to
make
them
so
and
he
had
made
himself
to
be
the
cause
god
set
me
right
before
this
folly
carry
me
on
farther
he
murmured
and
he
smiled
unhappily
though
fondly
as
he
thought
yes
there
is
one
whom
i
may
trust
with
even
my
soul
last
shred
and
dagonet
will
sing
for
me
tonight
an
old
song
not
too
merry
or
too
sad
when
dagonet
having
entered
stood
before
the
king
as
one
affrighted
the
king
smiled
you
think
because
i
call
for
you
so
late
that
i
am
angry
dagonet
why
so
have
you
been
saying
what
i
say
to
you
and
telling
men
that
you
brought
merlin
here
no
so
i
fancied
and
if
you
report
no
syllable
of
anything
i
speak
you
will
have
no
regrets
and
i
no
anger
what
word
of
merlin
was
abroad
today
today
have
i
heard
no
man
save
gawaine
and
to
him
i
said
only
what
all
men
are
saying
to
their
neighbors
they
believe
that
you
have
merlin
here
and
that
his
coming
denotes
no
good
gawaine
was
curious
but
ever
mindful
of
your
majesty
he
pressed
me
not
and
we
made
light
of
it
gawaine
i
fear
makes
light
of
everything
the
king
said
looking
down
sometimes
i
wish
i
had
a
full
round
table
of
gawaines
but
that
a
freak
of
midnight
never
mind
it
sing
me
a
song
one
of
those
endless
things
that
merlin
liked
of
old
when
men
were
younger
and
there
were
more
stars
twinkling
in
the
sky
i
see
no
stars
that
are
alive
tonight
and
i
am
not
the
king
of
sleep
so
then
sing
me
an
old
song
dagonet
quick
eye
caught
sorrow
in
the
king
and
he
knew
more
in
a
fool
way
than
even
the
king
himself
of
what
was
hovering
over
camelot
o
king
he
said
i
can
not
sing
tonight
if
you
command
me
i
shall
try
to
sing
but
i
shall
fail
for
there
are
no
songs
now
in
my
old
throat
or
even
in
these
poor
strings
that
i
can
hardly
follow
with
my
fingers
forgive
me
kill
me
but
i
can
not
sing
dagonet
fell
down
then
on
both
his
knees
and
shook
there
while
he
clutched
the
king
cold
hand
and
wept
for
what
he
knew
there
dagonet
i
shall
not
kill
my
knight
or
make
him
sing
no
more
get
up
and
get
you
off
to
bed
there
be
another
time
for
you
to
sing
so
get
you
to
your
covers
and
sleep
well
alone
again
the
king
said
bitterly
yes
i
have
one
friend
left
and
they
who
know
as
much
of
him
as
of
themselves
believe
that
he
a
fool
poor
dagonet
a
fool
and
if
he
be
a
fool
what
else
am
i
than
one
fool
more
to
make
the
world
complete
love
that
never
was
fool
fool
fool
fool
the
king
was
long
awake
no
covenant
with
peace
was
his
tonight
and
he
knew
sleep
as
he
knew
the
cold
eyes
of
guinevere
that
yesterday
had
stabbed
him
having
first
on
lancelot
name
struck
fire
and
left
him
then
as
now
they
left
him
with
a
wounded
heart
a
wounded
pride
and
a
sickening
pang
worse
yet
of
lost
possession
he
thought
wearily
of
watchers
by
the
dead
late
wayfarers
mariners
on
ships
at
sea
sentries
wastrels
and
all
others
who
might
be
saying
somewhere
to
themselves
the
king
is
now
asleep
in
camelot
god
save
the
king
god
save
the
king
indeed
if
there
be
now
a
king
to
save
he
said
then
he
saw
giants
rising
in
the
dark
born
horribly
of
memories
and
new
fears
that
in
the
irony
of
dawn
were
partly
to
fade
out
and
be
forgotten
and
then
there
might
be
sleep
and
for
a
time
there
might
again
be
peace
his
head
was
hot
and
throbbing
but
the
rest
of
him
was
cold
as
he
lay
staring
hard
where
nothing
stood
and
hearing
what
was
not
even
while
he
saw
and
heard
like
dust
and
thunder
far
away
the
coming
confirmation
of
the
words
of
him
who
saw
so
much
and
feared
so
little
of
all
that
was
to
be
no
spoken
doom
that
ever
chilled
the
last
night
of
a
felon
prepared
a
dragging
anguish
more
profound
and
absolute
than
arthur
in
these
hours
made
out
of
darkness
and
of
merlin
words
no
tide
that
ever
crashed
on
lyonnesse
drove
echoes
inland
that
were
lonelier
for
widowed
ears
among
the
than
for
the
king
were
memories
tonight
of
old
illusions
that
were
dead
for
ever
iv
the
tortured
king
seeing
merlin
wholly
meshed
in
his
defection
even
to
indifference
and
all
the
while
attended
and
exalted
by
some
unfathomable
obscurity
of
divination
where
the
grail
unseen
broke
yet
the
darkness
where
a
king
saw
nothing
feared
now
the
lady
vivian
more
than
fate
for
now
he
knew
that
modred
lancelot
the
queen
the
king
the
kingdom
and
the
world
were
less
to
merlin
who
had
made
him
king
than
one
small
woman
in
broceliande
whereas
the
lady
vivian
seeing
merlin
acclaimed
and
tempted
and
allured
again
to
service
in
his
old
magnificence
feared
now
king
arthur
more
than
storms
and
robbers
for
merlin
though
he
knew
himself
immune
to
no
least
whispered
little
wish
of
hers
that
might
afflict
his
ear
with
ecstasy
had
yet
sufficient
of
his
old
command
of
all
around
him
to
invest
an
eye
with
quiet
lightning
and
a
spoken
word
with
easy
thunder
so
accomplishing
a
profit
and
a
pastime
for
himself
and
for
the
lady
vivian
when
her
guile
outlived
at
intervals
her
graciousness
and
this
equipment
of
uncertainty
which
now
had
gone
away
with
him
to
britain
with
dagonet
so
plagued
her
memory
that
soon
a
phantom
brood
of
goblin
doubts
inhabited
his
absence
which
had
else
been
empty
waiting
and
a
few
brave
fears
and
a
few
more
she
knew
that
were
not
brave
or
long
to
be
disowned
or
manageable
she
thought
of
him
as
he
had
looked
at
her
when
first
he
had
acquainted
her
alarm
at
sight
of
the
king
letter
with
its
import
and
she
remembered
now
his
very
words
the
king
believes
today
as
in
his
boyhood
that
i
am
fate
he
said
and
when
they
parted
she
had
not
even
asked
him
not
to
go
she
might
as
well
she
thought
have
bid
the
wind
throw
no
more
clouds
across
a
lonely
sky
between
her
and
the
moon
so
great
he
seemed
in
his
oppressed
solemnity
and
she
in
her
excess
of
wrong
imagining
so
trivial
in
an
hour
and
after
all
a
creature
of
a
smaller
consequence
than
kings
to
merlin
who
made
kings
and
kingdoms
and
had
them
as
a
father
and
so
she
feared
king
arthur
more
than
robbers
while
she
waited
for
merlin
promise
to
fulfil
itself
and
for
the
rest
that
was
to
follow
after
he
said
he
would
come
back
and
so
he
will
he
will
because
he
must
and
he
is
merlin
the
master
of
the
world
or
so
he
was
and
he
is
coming
back
again
to
me
because
he
must
and
i
am
vivian
it
all
as
easy
as
two
added
numbers
some
day
i
hear
him
ringing
at
the
gate
as
he
rang
on
that
morning
in
the
spring
ten
years
ago
and
i
shall
have
him
then
for
ever
he
shall
never
go
away
though
kings
come
walking
on
their
hands
and
knees
to
take
him
on
their
backs
when
merlin
came
she
told
him
that
and
laughed
and
he
said
strangely
be
glad
or
sorry
but
no
kings
are
coming
not
arthur
surely
for
now
arthur
knows
that
i
am
less
than
fate
ten
years
ago
the
king
had
heard
with
unbelieving
ears
at
first
what
merlin
said
would
be
the
last
reiteration
of
his
going
down
to
find
a
living
grave
in
brittany
buried
alive
i
told
you
i
should
be
by
love
made
little
and
by
woman
shorn
like
samson
of
my
glory
and
the
time
is
now
at
hand
i
follow
in
the
morning
where
i
am
led
i
see
behind
me
now
the
last
of
crossways
and
i
see
before
me
a
straight
and
final
highway
to
the
end
of
all
my
divination
you
are
king
and
in
your
kingdom
i
am
what
i
was
wherever
i
have
warned
you
see
as
far
as
i
have
seen
for
i
have
shown
the
worst
there
is
to
see
require
no
more
of
me
for
i
can
be
no
more
than
what
i
was
so
on
the
morrow
the
king
said
farewell
and
he
was
never
more
to
merlin
eye
the
king
than
at
that
hour
for
merlin
knew
how
much
was
going
out
of
arthur
life
with
him
as
he
went
southward
to
the
sea
over
the
waves
and
into
brittany
went
merlin
to
broceliande
gay
birds
were
singing
high
to
greet
him
all
along
a
broad
and
sanded
woodland
avenue
that
led
him
on
forever
so
he
thought
until
at
last
there
was
an
end
of
it
and
at
the
end
there
was
a
gate
of
iron
wrought
heavily
and
invidiously
barred
he
pulled
a
cord
that
rang
somewhere
a
bell
of
many
echoes
and
sat
down
to
rest
outside
the
keeper
house
upon
a
bench
of
carven
stone
that
might
for
centuries
have
waited
there
in
silence
to
receive
him
the
birds
were
singing
still
leaves
flashed
and
swung
before
him
in
the
sunlight
a
soft
breeze
made
intermittent
whisperings
around
him
of
love
and
fate
and
danger
and
faint
waves
of
many
fragile
odors
broke
lightly
as
they
touched
him
above
him
snowed
white
petals
down
upon
him
and
under
their
slow
falling
merlin
smiled
contentedly
as
one
who
contemplates
no
longer
fear
confusion
or
regret
may
smile
at
ruin
or
at
revelation
a
stately
fellow
with
a
forest
air
now
hailed
him
from
within
with
searching
words
and
curious
looks
till
merlin
glowing
eye
transfixed
him
and
he
flinched
my
compliments
and
homage
to
the
lady
vivian
say
merlin
from
king
arthur
court
is
here
a
pilgrim
and
a
stranger
in
appearance
though
in
effect
her
friend
and
humble
servant
convey
to
her
my
speech
as
i
have
said
it
without
abbreviation
or
delay
and
so
deserve
my
gratitude
forever
but
merlin
the
man
stammered
merlin
merlin
one
merlin
is
enough
i
know
no
other
now
go
you
to
the
lady
vivian
and
bring
to
me
her
word
for
i
am
weary
still
smiling
at
the
falling
down
on
him
and
around
him
in
the
sunlight
he
waited
never
moving
never
glancing
this
way
or
that
until
his
messenger
came
jingling
into
vision
weighed
with
keys
and
inly
shaken
with
much
wondering
at
this
great
wizard
coming
unannounced
and
unattended
when
the
way
was
open
the
stately
messenger
now
bowing
low
in
reverence
and
awe
bade
merlin
enter
and
merlin
having
entered
heard
the
gate
clang
back
behind
him
and
he
swore
no
gate
like
that
had
ever
clanged
in
camelot
or
any
other
place
if
not
in
hell
i
may
be
dead
and
this
good
fellow
here
with
all
his
keys
he
thought
may
be
the
devil
though
i
were
loath
to
say
so
for
the
keys
would
make
him
rather
more
akin
to
peter
and
that
fair
reasoning
for
this
fair
weather
the
lady
vivian
says
you
are
most
welcome
said
now
the
servitor
and
are
to
follow
me
she
said
merlin
a
pilgrim
and
a
stranger
in
appearance
though
in
effect
my
friend
and
humble
servant
is
welcome
for
himself
and
for
the
sound
of
his
great
name
that
echoes
everywhere
i
like
you
and
i
like
your
memory
said
merlin
curiously
but
not
your
gate
why
forge
for
this
elysian
wilderness
a
thing
so
vicious
with
unholy
noise
there
a
way
out
of
every
wilderness
for
those
who
dare
or
care
enough
to
find
it
the
guide
said
and
they
moved
along
together
down
shaded
ways
through
open
ways
with
hedgerows
and
into
shade
again
more
deep
than
ever
but
edged
anon
with
rays
of
broken
sunshine
in
which
a
fountain
raining
crystal
music
made
faery
magic
of
it
through
green
leafage
till
merlin
eyes
were
dim
with
preparation
for
sight
now
of
the
lady
vivian
he
saw
at
first
a
bit
of
living
green
that
might
have
been
a
part
of
all
the
green
around
the
tinkling
fountain
where
she
gazed
upon
the
circling
pool
as
if
her
thoughts
were
not
so
much
on
merlin
whose
advance
betrayed
through
his
enormity
of
hair
the
cheeks
and
eyes
of
youth
as
on
the
fishes
but
soon
she
turned
and
found
him
now
alone
and
held
him
while
her
beauty
and
her
grace
made
passing
trash
of
empires
and
his
eyes
told
hers
of
what
a
splendid
emptiness
her
tedious
world
had
been
without
him
in
it
whose
love
and
service
were
to
be
her
school
her
triumph
and
her
history
this
is
merlin
she
thought
and
i
shall
dream
of
him
no
more
and
he
has
come
he
thinks
to
frighten
me
with
beards
and
robes
and
his
immortal
fame
or
is
it
i
who
think
so
i
know
not
i
frightened
sure
enough
but
if
i
show
it
i
be
no
more
the
vivian
for
whose
love
he
tossed
away
his
glory
or
the
vivian
who
saw
no
man
alive
to
make
her
love
him
till
she
saw
merlin
once
in
camelot
and
seeing
him
saw
no
other
in
an
age
that
has
no
plan
for
me
that
i
can
read
without
him
shall
he
tell
me
what
i
am
and
why
i
am
i
wonder
while
she
thought
and
feared
the
man
whom
her
perverse
negation
must
overcome
somehow
to
soothe
her
fancy
she
smiled
and
welcomed
him
and
so
they
stood
each
finding
in
the
other
eyes
a
gleam
of
what
eternity
had
hidden
there
are
you
always
all
in
green
as
you
are
now
said
merlin
more
employed
with
her
complexion
where
blood
and
olive
made
wild
harmony
with
eyes
and
wayward
hair
that
were
too
dark
for
peace
if
they
were
not
subordinated
if
so
you
are
then
so
you
make
yourself
a
danger
in
a
world
of
many
dangers
if
i
were
young
god
knows
if
i
were
safe
concerning
you
in
green
like
a
slim
cedar
as
you
are
now
to
say
my
life
was
mine
were
you
to
say
to
me
that
i
should
end
it
longevity
for
me
were
jeopardized
have
you
your
green
on
always
and
all
over
come
here
and
i
will
tell
you
about
that
said
vivian
leading
merlin
with
a
laugh
to
an
arbored
seat
where
they
made
opposites
if
you
are
merlin
and
i
know
you
are
for
i
remember
you
in
camelot
you
know
that
i
am
vivian
as
i
am
and
if
i
go
in
green
why
let
me
go
so
and
say
at
once
why
you
have
come
to
me
cloaked
over
like
a
monk
and
with
a
beard
as
long
as
jeremiah
i
do
like
it
i
never
like
a
man
with
hair
like
that
while
i
can
feed
a
carp
with
little
frogs
i
rather
sure
to
hate
you
if
you
keep
it
and
when
i
hate
a
man
i
poison
him
you
never
fed
a
carp
with
little
frogs
said
merlin
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
i
might
then
if
i
have
said
the
lady
for
i
a
savage
and
i
love
no
man
as
i
have
seen
him
yet
i
here
alone
with
some
three
hundred
others
all
of
whom
are
ready
i
dare
say
to
die
for
me
i
cruel
and
i
cold
and
i
like
snakes
and
some
have
said
my
mother
was
a
fairy
though
i
believe
it
not
why
not
believe
it
said
merlin
i
believe
it
i
believe
also
that
you
divine
as
i
had
wished
in
my
surviving
ornament
of
office
a
needless
imposition
on
your
wits
if
not
yet
on
the
scope
of
your
regard
even
so
you
can
not
say
how
old
i
am
or
yet
how
young
i
willing
cheerfully
to
fight
hell
three
headed
hound
if
you
but
whistle
him
up
from
where
he
lives
i
cheerful
and
i
fierce
and
i
made
kings
and
some
have
said
my
father
was
the
devil
though
i
believe
it
not
whatever
i
am
i
have
not
lived
in
time
until
a
moment
worth
of
wisdom
there
escaped
him
but
vivian
seized
it
and
it
was
not
lost
embroidering
doom
with
many
levities
till
now
the
fountain
crystal
silver
fading
became
a
splash
and
a
mere
chilliness
they
mocked
their
fate
with
easy
pleasantries
that
were
too
false
and
small
to
be
forgotten
and
with
ingenious
insincerities
that
had
no
repetition
or
revival
at
last
the
lady
vivian
arose
and
with
a
crying
of
how
late
it
was
took
merlin
hand
and
led
him
like
a
child
along
a
dusky
way
between
tall
cones
of
tight
green
cedars
am
i
like
one
of
these
you
said
i
was
though
i
deny
it
wholly
very
said
merlin
to
his
bearded
lips
uplifting
her
small
o
that
hair
she
moaned
as
if
in
sorrow
must
it
be
must
every
prophet
and
important
wizard
be
clouded
so
that
nothing
but
his
nose
and
eyes
and
intimations
of
his
ears
are
there
to
make
us
know
him
when
we
see
him
praise
heaven
i
not
a
prophet
are
you
glad
he
did
not
say
that
he
was
glad
or
sorry
for
suddenly
came
flashing
into
vision
a
thing
that
was
a
manor
and
a
palace
with
walls
and
roofs
that
had
a
flaming
sky
behind
them
like
a
sky
that
he
remembered
and
one
that
had
from
his
haunt
above
the
roofs
of
his
forsaken
city
made
flame
as
if
all
camelot
were
on
fire
the
glow
brought
with
it
a
brief
memory
of
arthur
as
he
left
him
and
the
pain
that
fought
in
arthur
eyes
for
losing
him
and
must
have
overflowed
when
he
had
vanished
but
now
the
eyes
that
looked
hard
into
his
were
vivian
not
the
king
and
he
could
see
or
so
he
thought
a
shade
of
sorrow
in
them
she
took
his
two
hands
you
are
sad
she
he
smiled
your
western
lights
bring
memories
of
camelot
we
all
have
memories
prophets
and
women
who
are
like
slim
cedars
but
you
are
wrong
to
say
that
i
am
sad
would
you
go
back
to
camelot
she
asked
her
fingers
tightening
merlin
shook
his
head
then
listen
while
i
tell
you
that
i
glad
she
purred
as
if
assured
that
he
would
listen
at
your
first
warning
much
too
long
ago
of
this
quaint
pilgrimage
of
yours
to
see
fairest
and
most
orgulous
of
ladies
no
language
for
a
prophet
i
am
sure
said
i
this
great
merlin
comes
to
me
my
task
and
avocation
for
some
time
will
be
to
make
him
willing
if
i
can
to
teach
and
feed
me
with
an
ounce
of
wisdom
for
i
have
eaten
to
an
empty
shell
after
a
weary
feast
of
observation
among
the
glories
of
a
tinsel
world
that
had
for
me
no
glory
till
you
came
a
life
that
is
no
life
would
you
go
back
to
camelot
merlin
shook
his
head
again
and
the
two
smiled
together
in
the
sunset
they
moved
along
in
silence
to
the
door
where
merlin
said
of
your
three
hundred
here
there
is
but
one
i
know
and
him
i
favor
i
mean
the
stately
one
who
shakes
the
keys
of
that
most
evil
sounding
gate
of
yours
which
has
a
clang
as
if
it
shut
forever
if
there
be
need
i
shut
the
gate
myself
she
said
and
you
like
blaise
then
you
shall
have
him
he
was
not
born
to
serve
but
serve
he
must
it
seems
and
be
enamoured
of
my
shadow
he
cherishes
the
taint
of
some
high
folly
that
haunts
him
with
a
name
he
can
not
know
and
i
could
fear
his
wits
are
paying
for
it
forgive
his
tongue
and
humor
it
a
little
i
knew
another
one
whose
name
was
blaise
he
said
and
she
said
lightly
well
what
of
it
and
he
was
nigh
the
learnedest
of
hermits
his
home
was
far
away
from
everywhere
and
he
was
all
alone
there
when
he
died
now
be
a
pleasant
merlin
vivian
said
patting
his
arm
and
have
no
more
of
that
for
i
not
hear
of
dead
men
far
away
or
dead
men
anywhere
this
afternoon
there
be
a
trifle
in
the
way
of
supper
this
evening
but
the
dead
shall
not
have
any
blaise
and
this
man
will
tell
you
all
there
is
for
you
to
know
then
you
know
everything
she
laughed
and
vanished
like
a
v
the
sun
went
down
and
the
dark
after
it
starred
merlin
new
abode
with
many
a
sconced
and
many
a
moving
candle
in
whose
light
the
prisoned
wizard
mirrored
in
amazement
saw
fronting
him
a
stranger
of
a
negligible
age
and
fair
enough
to
look
upon
he
fancied
though
not
a
warrior
born
nor
more
a
courtier
a
native
humor
resting
in
his
long
and
solemn
jaws
now
stirred
and
merlin
smiled
to
see
himself
in
purple
touched
with
gold
and
fledged
with
snowy
the
careful
blaise
having
drawn
some
time
before
from
merlin
wallet
the
sable
raiment
of
a
royal
scholar
had
eyed
it
with
a
long
mistrust
and
said
the
lady
vivian
would
be
vexed
i
fear
to
meet
you
vested
in
these
learned
weeds
of
gravity
and
death
for
she
abhors
mortality
in
all
its
hues
and
emblems
black
wear
long
argument
and
all
the
cold
and
solemn
things
that
appertain
to
graves
and
merlin
listening
to
himself
had
said
this
fellow
has
a
freedom
yet
i
like
him
and
then
aloud
i
trust
you
deck
me
out
however
with
a
temperate
regard
for
what
your
candid
eye
may
find
in
me
of
inward
coloring
let
them
reap
my
beard
moreover
with
a
sort
of
reverence
for
i
shall
never
look
on
it
again
and
though
your
lady
frown
her
face
away
to
think
of
me
in
black
for
god
indulgence
array
me
not
in
scarlet
or
in
yellow
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
merlin
sat
at
ease
in
purple
even
though
his
chin
reproached
him
as
he
pinched
it
and
seemed
yet
a
little
fearful
of
its
nakedness
he
might
have
sat
and
scanned
himself
for
ever
had
not
the
careful
blaise
regarding
him
remarked
again
that
in
his
proper
judgment
and
on
the
valid
word
of
his
attendants
no
more
was
to
be
done
then
do
no
more
said
merlin
with
a
last
look
at
his
chin
never
do
more
when
there
no
more
to
do
and
you
may
shun
thereby
the
bitter
taste
of
many
disillusions
and
regrets
god
pity
on
us
that
our
words
have
wings
and
leave
our
deeds
to
crawl
so
far
below
them
for
we
have
all
two
heights
we
men
who
dream
whether
we
lead
or
follow
rule
or
serve
god
pity
on
us
anyhow
blaise
answered
or
most
of
us
meanwhile
i
have
to
say
as
long
as
you
are
here
and
i
alive
your
summons
will
assure
the
loyalty
of
all
my
diligence
and
expedition
the
gong
that
you
hear
singing
in
the
distance
was
rung
for
your
attention
and
your
presence
i
wonder
at
this
fellow
yet
i
like
him
said
merlin
and
he
rose
to
follow
him
the
lady
vivian
in
a
fragile
sheath
of
crimson
dimmed
and
veiled
ineffably
by
the
gloom
wherein
she
sat
and
twinkled
if
she
moved
heard
merlin
coming
and
smiled
as
if
to
make
herself
believe
her
joy
was
all
a
triumph
yet
her
blood
confessed
a
tingling
of
more
wonderment
than
all
her
five
and
twenty
worldly
years
of
waiting
for
this
triumph
could
remember
and
when
she
knew
and
felt
the
slower
tread
of
his
unseen
advance
among
the
shadows
to
the
small
haven
of
uncertain
light
that
held
her
in
it
as
a
shoal
might
hold
a
smooth
red
fish
her
listening
skin
responded
with
a
creeping
underneath
it
and
a
crinkling
that
was
incident
alike
to
darkness
love
and
mice
when
he
was
there
she
looked
up
at
him
in
a
whirl
of
mirth
and
wonder
as
in
childhood
she
had
gazed
on
royal
mountebanks
who
made
so
brief
a
shift
of
the
impossible
that
kings
and
queens
would
laugh
and
shake
themselves
then
rising
slowly
on
her
little
feet
like
a
slim
creature
lifted
she
thrust
out
her
two
small
hands
as
if
to
push
him
back
whereon
he
seized
them
go
away
she
said
i
never
saw
you
in
my
life
before
you
say
the
truth
he
answered
when
i
met
myself
an
hour
ago
my
words
were
yours
god
made
the
man
you
see
for
you
to
like
if
possible
if
otherwise
turn
down
these
two
prodigious
and
remorseless
thumbs
and
leave
your
lions
to
annihilate
him
i
have
no
other
lion
than
yourself
she
said
and
since
you
can
not
eat
yourself
pray
do
a
lonely
woman
who
is
you
say
more
like
a
tree
than
any
other
thing
in
your
discrimination
the
large
honor
of
sharing
with
her
a
small
kind
of
supper
yes
you
are
like
a
tree
or
like
a
flower
more
like
a
flower
he
bowed
his
head
and
kissed
the
ten
small
fingers
he
was
holding
as
calmly
as
if
each
had
been
a
son
although
his
heart
was
leaping
and
his
eyes
had
sight
for
nothing
save
a
swimming
crimson
between
two
glimmering
arms
more
like
a
flower
he
said
as
now
he
scanned
again
the
immemorial
meaning
of
her
face
and
drew
it
nearer
to
his
eyes
it
seemed
a
flower
of
wonder
with
a
crimson
stem
came
leaning
slowly
and
regretfully
to
meet
his
will
a
flower
of
change
and
peril
that
had
a
clinging
blossom
of
warm
olive
half
stifled
with
a
tyranny
of
black
and
held
the
wayward
fragrance
of
a
rose
made
woman
by
delirious
alchemy
she
raised
her
face
and
yoked
his
willing
neck
with
half
her
weight
and
with
hot
lips
that
left
the
world
with
only
philosophy
for
merlin
or
for
anaxagoras
called
his
to
meet
them
and
in
one
long
hush
of
capture
to
surrender
and
make
hers
the
last
of
anything
that
might
remain
of
what
were
now
their
beardless
wizardry
then
slowly
she
began
to
push
herself
away
and
slowly
merlin
let
her
go
as
far
from
him
as
his
outreaching
hands
could
hold
her
fingers
while
his
eyes
had
all
the
beauty
of
the
woodland
and
the
world
before
him
in
the
firelight
like
a
nymph
of
cities
or
a
queen
a
little
weary
of
inland
stillness
and
immortal
trees
are
you
to
let
me
go
again
sometime
she
said
before
i
starve
to
death
i
wonder
if
not
i
have
to
bite
the
lion
paws
and
make
him
roar
he
can
not
shake
his
mane
for
now
the
lion
has
no
mane
to
shake
the
lion
hardly
knows
himself
without
it
and
thinks
he
has
no
face
but
there
a
lady
who
says
he
had
no
face
until
he
lost
it
so
there
we
are
and
there
a
flute
somewhere
playing
a
strange
old
tune
you
know
the
words
lion
and
the
lady
are
both
hungry
fatigue
and
hunger
tempered
leisurely
with
food
that
some
devout
magician
oven
might
after
many
failures
have
delivered
and
wine
that
had
for
decades
in
the
dark
of
merlin
grave
been
slowly
quickening
and
with
interludes
of
distant
flutes
and
viols
made
yet
more
distant
by
far
nostalgic
hautboys
blown
from
nowhere
were
tempered
not
so
leisurely
may
be
with
vivian
inextinguishable
eyes
between
two
shining
silver
candlesticks
that
lifted
each
a
trembling
flame
to
make
the
rest
of
her
a
dusky
loveliness
against
a
bank
of
shadow
merlin
made
as
well
as
he
was
able
while
he
ate
a
fair
division
of
the
fealty
due
to
food
and
beauty
albeit
more
times
than
one
was
he
at
odds
with
his
urbanity
in
honoring
too
long
the
grosser
viand
the
best
invention
in
broceliande
has
not
been
in
vain
i
see
she
told
him
with
her
chin
propped
on
her
fingers
and
her
eyes
flashing
blindness
into
his
i
put
myself
out
cruelly
to
please
you
and
you
for
that
forget
almost
at
once
the
name
and
image
of
me
altogether
you
need
for
when
all
is
analyzed
it
only
a
that
you
are
eating
i
know
not
what
you
call
it
merlin
said
nor
more
do
i
forget
your
name
and
image
though
i
do
eat
and
if
i
did
not
eat
your
sending
out
of
ships
and
caravans
to
get
whatever
is
that
in
this
thing
would
be
a
sorrow
for
you
all
your
days
and
my
great
love
which
you
have
seen
by
now
might
look
to
you
a
lie
and
like
as
not
you
actuate
some
sinewed
mercenary
to
carry
me
away
to
god
knows
where
and
seal
me
in
a
fearsome
hole
to
starve
because
i
made
of
this
insidious
picking
an
idle
circumstance
my
dear
fair
lady
and
there
is
not
another
under
heaven
so
fair
as
you
are
as
i
see
you
now
i
can
not
look
at
you
too
much
and
eat
and
i
must
eat
or
be
untimely
ashes
whereon
the
light
of
your
celestial
gaze
would
fall
i
fear
me
for
no
longer
time
than
on
the
solemn
dust
of
jeremiah
whose
beard
you
likened
once
in
heathen
jest
to
mine
that
now
is
no
man
are
you
sorry
said
vivian
filling
merlin
empty
goblet
if
you
are
sorry
for
the
loss
of
it
drink
more
of
this
and
you
may
tell
me
lies
enough
to
make
me
sure
that
you
are
glad
but
if
your
love
is
what
you
say
it
is
be
never
sorry
that
my
love
took
off
that
horrid
hair
to
make
your
face
at
last
a
human
fact
since
i
have
had
your
name
to
dream
of
and
say
over
to
myself
the
visitations
of
that
awful
beard
have
been
a
terror
for
my
nights
and
days
for
twenty
years
i
seen
it
like
an
ocean
blown
seven
ways
at
once
and
wrecking
ships
with
men
and
women
screaming
for
their
lives
i
seen
it
woven
into
shining
ladders
that
ran
up
out
of
sight
and
so
to
heaven
all
covered
with
white
ghosts
with
hanging
robes
like
folded
wings
and
there
were
millions
of
them
climbing
climbing
climbing
all
the
time
and
all
the
time
that
i
was
watching
them
i
thought
how
far
above
me
merlin
was
and
wondered
always
what
his
face
was
like
but
even
then
as
a
child
i
knew
the
day
would
come
some
time
when
i
should
see
his
face
and
hear
his
voice
and
have
him
in
my
house
till
he
should
care
no
more
to
stay
in
it
and
go
away
to
found
another
kingdom
not
that
he
said
and
sighing
drank
more
wine
one
kingdom
for
one
merlin
is
enough
one
merlin
for
one
vivian
is
enough
she
said
if
you
care
much
remember
that
but
the
lord
knows
how
many
vivians
one
merlin
entertaining
eye
might
favor
indifferently
well
and
all
at
once
if
they
were
all
at
hand
praise
heaven
they
not
if
they
were
in
the
world
praise
heaven
they
not
and
if
one
merlin
entertaining
eye
saw
two
of
them
there
might
be
left
him
then
the
sight
of
no
eye
to
see
anything
not
even
the
vivian
who
is
everything
she
being
beauty
beauty
being
she
she
being
vivian
and
so
forever
i
glad
you
do
see
two
of
me
she
said
for
there
a
whole
world
yet
for
you
to
eat
and
drink
and
say
to
me
before
i
know
the
kind
of
creature
that
you
see
in
me
i
withering
for
a
little
more
attention
but
being
woman
i
can
wait
these
cups
that
you
see
coming
are
for
the
last
there
is
of
what
my
father
gave
to
kings
alone
and
far
from
always
you
are
more
than
kings
to
me
therefore
i
give
it
all
to
you
imploring
you
to
spare
no
more
of
it
than
what
a
would
hold
for
me
to
pledge
your
love
and
mine
in
take
the
rest
that
i
may
see
tonight
the
end
of
it
i
have
no
living
remnant
of
the
dead
annoying
me
until
it
fades
and
sours
of
too
long
cherishing
for
time
enjoys
the
look
that
on
our
faces
when
we
scowl
on
unexpected
ruins
and
thrift
itself
may
be
a
kind
of
slow
unwholesome
fire
that
eats
away
to
dust
the
life
that
feeds
it
you
smile
i
see
but
i
said
what
i
said
one
hardly
has
to
live
a
thousand
years
to
contemplate
a
lost
economy
so
let
us
drink
it
while
it
yet
alive
and
you
and
i
are
not
untimely
ashes
my
last
words
are
your
own
and
i
do
like
a
sudden
laughter
scattered
from
her
eyes
a
threatening
wisdom
he
smiled
and
let
her
laugh
then
looked
into
the
dark
where
there
was
nothing
there
more
in
this
than
i
have
seen
he
thought
though
i
shall
see
it
drink
she
said
again
there
only
this
much
in
the
world
of
it
and
i
am
near
to
giving
all
to
you
because
you
are
so
great
and
i
so
little
with
a
gaze
that
caught
from
hers
a
laughing
flame
and
with
a
hand
that
shook
like
arthur
kingdom
merlin
slowly
raised
a
golden
cup
that
for
a
golden
moment
was
twinned
in
air
with
hers
and
vivian
who
smiled
at
him
across
their
gleaming
rims
from
eyes
that
made
a
fuel
of
the
night
surrounding
her
shot
glory
over
gold
at
merlin
while
their
cups
touched
and
his
trembled
he
drank
not
knowing
what
nor
caring
much
for
kings
who
might
have
cared
less
for
themselves
he
thought
had
all
the
darkness
and
wild
light
that
fell
together
to
make
vivian
been
there
before
them
then
to
flower
anew
through
sheathing
crimson
into
with
each
new
leer
of
their
loose
liquorish
eyes
again
he
drank
and
he
cursed
every
king
who
might
have
touched
her
even
in
her
cradle
for
what
were
kings
to
such
as
he
who
made
them
and
saw
them
totter
for
the
world
to
see
and
heed
if
the
world
would
he
drank
again
and
yet
again
to
make
himself
assured
no
manner
of
king
should
have
the
last
of
it
the
cup
that
vivian
filled
unfailingly
until
she
poured
for
nothing
at
the
end
of
this
incomparable
flowing
gold
she
prattled
on
to
merlin
who
observed
her
solemnly
i
fear
there
may
be
specks
he
sighed
aloud
whereat
she
laughed
at
him
and
pushed
the
golden
cup
a
little
nearer
he
scanned
it
with
a
sad
anxiety
and
then
her
face
likewise
and
shook
his
head
as
if
at
her
concern
for
such
a
matter
specks
what
are
specks
are
you
afraid
of
them
he
murmured
slowly
with
a
drowsy
tongue
there
are
specks
everywhere
i
fear
them
not
if
i
were
king
in
camelot
i
might
fear
more
than
specks
but
now
i
fear
them
not
you
are
too
strange
a
lady
to
fear
specks
he
stared
a
long
time
at
the
cup
of
gold
before
him
but
he
drank
no
more
there
came
between
him
and
the
world
a
crumbling
sky
of
black
and
crimson
with
a
crimson
cloud
that
held
a
far
off
town
of
many
towers
all
swayed
and
shaken
till
at
last
they
fell
and
there
was
nothing
but
a
crimson
cloud
that
crumbled
into
nothing
like
the
sky
that
vanished
with
it
carrying
away
the
world
the
woman
and
all
memory
of
them
until
a
slow
light
of
another
sky
made
gray
an
open
casement
showing
him
faint
shapes
of
an
exotic
furniture
that
glimmered
with
a
dim
magnificence
and
letting
in
the
sound
of
many
birds
that
were
as
he
lay
there
remembering
the
only
occupation
of
his
ears
until
it
seemed
they
shared
a
fainter
sound
as
if
a
sleeping
child
with
a
black
head
beside
him
drew
the
breath
of
innocence
one
shining
afternoon
around
the
fountain
as
on
the
shining
day
of
his
arrival
the
sunlight
was
alive
with
flying
silver
that
had
for
merlin
a
more
dazzling
flash
than
jewels
rained
in
dreams
and
a
richer
sound
than
harps
and
all
the
morning
stars
together
when
jewels
and
harps
and
stars
and
everything
that
flashed
and
sang
and
was
not
vivian
seemed
less
than
echoes
of
her
least
of
words
for
she
was
coming
suddenly
somewhere
behind
him
she
was
coming
that
was
all
he
knew
until
she
came
and
took
his
hand
and
held
it
while
she
talked
about
the
fishes
when
she
looked
up
he
thought
a
softer
light
was
in
her
eyes
than
once
he
had
found
there
and
had
there
been
left
yet
for
dusky
women
a
beauty
that
was
heretofore
not
hers
he
told
himself
he
must
have
seen
it
then
before
him
in
the
face
at
which
he
smiled
and
trembled
many
men
have
called
me
wise
he
said
but
you
are
wiser
than
all
wisdom
if
you
know
what
you
are
i
do
she
said
i
know
that
you
and
i
are
here
together
i
know
that
i
have
known
for
twenty
years
that
life
would
be
almost
a
constant
yawning
until
you
came
and
now
that
you
are
here
i
know
that
you
are
not
to
go
away
until
you
tell
me
that
i
hideous
i
know
that
i
like
fishes
ferns
and
snakes
maybe
because
i
liked
them
when
the
world
was
young
and
you
and
i
were
salamanders
i
know
too
a
cool
place
not
far
from
here
where
there
are
ferns
that
are
like
marching
men
who
never
march
away
come
now
and
see
them
and
do
as
they
do
never
march
away
when
they
are
gone
some
others
crisp
and
green
will
have
their
place
but
never
march
away
he
smoothed
her
silky
fingers
one
by
one
some
other
merlin
also
do
you
think
will
have
his
place
and
never
march
away
then
vivian
laid
a
finger
on
his
lips
and
shook
her
head
at
him
before
she
laughed
there
is
no
other
merlin
than
yourself
and
you
are
never
going
to
be
old
oblivious
of
a
world
that
made
of
him
a
jest
a
legend
and
a
long
regret
and
with
a
more
commanding
wizardry
than
his
to
rule
a
kingdom
where
the
king
was
love
and
the
queen
vivian
merlin
found
his
queen
without
the
blemish
of
a
word
that
was
more
rough
than
honey
from
her
lips
or
the
first
adumbration
of
a
frown
to
cloud
the
fire
that
in
her
eyes
had
yet
a
smoky
friendliness
of
home
and
a
foreknowing
care
for
mighty
trifles
there
are
miles
and
miles
for
you
to
wander
in
she
told
him
once
your
prison
yard
is
large
and
i
would
rather
take
my
two
ears
off
and
feed
them
to
the
fishes
in
the
fountain
than
buzz
like
an
incorrigible
bee
for
always
around
yours
and
have
you
hate
the
sound
of
me
for
some
day
then
for
certain
your
philosophic
rage
would
see
in
me
a
bee
in
earnest
and
your
hand
would
smite
my
life
away
and
what
would
you
do
then
i
know
for
years
and
years
you
sit
alone
upon
my
grave
and
be
the
grieving
image
of
lean
remorse
and
suffer
miserably
and
often
all
day
long
you
only
shake
your
celebrated
head
and
all
it
holds
or
beat
it
with
your
fist
the
while
you
groaned
aloud
and
went
on
saying
to
yourself
should
i
have
killed
her
or
believed
she
was
a
bee
that
buzzed
herself
to
death
first
having
made
me
crazy
had
there
been
judicious
distance
and
wise
absences
to
keep
the
two
of
us
inquisitive
i
fear
you
bow
your
unoffending
head
before
a
load
that
should
be
mine
said
he
if
so
you
led
me
on
by
listening
you
should
have
shrieked
and
jumped
and
then
fled
yelling
that
the
best
way
when
a
man
talks
too
long
god
pity
on
me
if
i
love
your
feet
more
now
than
i
could
ever
love
the
face
of
any
one
of
all
those
vivians
you
summoned
out
of
nothing
on
the
night
when
i
saw
towers
i
wander
and
amend
at
that
she
flung
the
noose
of
her
soft
arms
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
instantly
you
are
the
wisest
man
that
ever
was
and
i
a
prayer
to
make
may
all
you
say
to
vivian
be
a
part
of
what
you
knew
before
the
curse
of
her
unquiet
head
was
on
your
shoulder
as
you
have
it
now
to
punish
you
for
knowing
beyond
knowledge
you
are
the
only
one
who
sees
enough
to
make
me
see
how
far
away
i
am
from
all
that
i
have
seen
and
have
not
been
you
are
the
only
thing
there
is
alive
between
me
as
i
am
and
as
i
was
when
merlin
was
a
dream
you
are
to
listen
when
i
say
now
to
you
that
i
alone
like
you
i
saw
too
much
and
unlike
you
i
made
no
kingdom
out
of
what
i
saw
or
none
save
this
one
here
that
you
must
rule
believing
you
are
ruled
i
see
too
far
to
rule
myself
time
way
with
you
and
me
is
our
way
in
that
we
are
out
of
time
and
out
of
tune
with
time
we
have
this
place
and
you
must
hold
us
in
it
or
we
die
look
at
me
now
and
say
if
what
i
say
be
folly
or
not
for
my
unquiet
head
is
no
conceit
of
mine
i
had
it
first
when
i
was
born
and
i
shall
have
it
with
me
till
my
unquiet
soul
is
on
its
way
to
be
i
hope
where
souls
are
quieter
so
let
the
first
and
last
activity
of
what
you
say
so
often
is
your
love
be
always
to
remember
that
our
lyres
are
not
strung
for
today
on
you
it
falls
to
keep
them
in
accord
here
with
each
other
for
you
have
wisdom
i
have
only
sight
for
distant
things
and
you
and
you
are
merlin
poor
wizard
vivian
is
your
punishment
for
making
kings
of
men
who
are
not
kings
and
you
are
mine
by
the
same
reasoning
for
living
out
of
time
and
out
of
tune
with
anything
but
you
no
other
man
could
make
me
say
so
much
of
what
i
know
as
i
say
now
to
you
and
you
are
merlin
she
looked
up
at
him
till
his
way
was
lost
again
in
the
familiar
wilderness
of
night
that
love
made
for
him
in
her
eyes
and
there
he
wandered
as
he
said
he
would
he
wandered
also
in
his
and
when
he
found
her
coming
after
him
beguiled
her
with
her
own
admonishing
and
frowned
upon
her
with
a
fierce
reproof
that
many
a
time
in
the
old
world
outside
had
set
the
mark
of
silence
on
strong
men
whereat
she
laughed
not
always
wholly
sure
nor
always
wholly
glad
that
he
who
played
so
lightly
was
the
wizard
of
her
dreams
no
matter
if
only
merlin
keep
the
world
away
she
thought
our
lyres
have
many
strings
but
he
must
know
them
all
for
he
is
merlin
and
so
for
years
till
ten
of
them
were
gone
ten
years
ten
seasons
or
ten
flying
ages
fate
made
broceliande
a
paradise
by
none
invaded
until
dagonet
like
a
discordant
awkward
bird
of
doom
flew
in
with
arthur
message
for
the
king
in
sorrow
cleaving
to
simplicity
and
having
in
his
love
a
quick
remembrance
of
merlin
old
affection
for
the
fellow
had
for
this
vain
reluctant
enterprise
appointed
him
the
knight
who
made
men
laugh
and
was
a
fool
because
he
played
the
fool
the
king
believes
today
as
in
his
boyhood
that
i
am
fate
and
i
can
do
no
more
than
show
again
what
in
his
heart
he
knows
said
merlin
to
himself
and
vivian
this
time
i
go
because
i
made
him
king
thereby
to
be
a
mirror
for
the
world
this
time
i
go
but
never
after
this
for
i
can
be
no
more
than
what
i
was
and
i
can
do
no
more
than
i
have
done
he
took
her
slowly
in
his
arms
and
felt
her
body
throbbing
like
a
bird
against
him
this
time
i
go
i
go
because
i
must
and
in
the
morning
when
he
rode
away
with
dagonet
and
blaise
through
the
same
gate
that
once
had
clanged
as
if
to
shut
for
ever
she
had
not
even
asked
him
not
to
go
for
it
was
then
that
in
his
lonely
gaze
of
helpless
love
and
sad
authority
she
found
the
gleam
of
his
imprisoned
power
that
fate
withheld
and
pitying
herself
she
pitied
the
fond
merlin
she
had
changed
and
saw
the
merlin
who
had
changed
the
world
vi
no
kings
are
coming
on
their
hands
and
knees
nor
yet
on
horses
or
in
chariots
to
carry
me
away
from
you
again
said
merlin
winding
around
vivian
ear
a
shred
of
her
black
hair
king
arthur
knows
that
i
have
done
with
kings
and
that
i
speak
no
more
their
crafty
language
once
i
knew
it
but
now
the
only
language
i
have
left
is
one
that
i
must
never
let
you
hear
too
long
or
know
too
well
when
towering
deeds
once
done
shall
only
out
of
dust
and
words
be
done
again
the
doer
may
then
be
wary
lest
in
the
complement
of
his
new
fabric
there
be
more
words
than
dust
why
tell
me
so
said
vivian
and
a
singular
thin
laugh
came
after
her
thin
question
do
you
think
that
i
so
far
away
from
history
that
i
require
even
of
the
wisest
man
who
ever
said
the
wrong
thing
to
a
woman
so
large
a
light
on
what
i
know
already
when
all
i
seek
is
here
before
me
now
in
your
new
eyes
that
you
have
brought
for
me
from
camelot
the
eyes
you
took
away
were
sad
and
old
and
i
could
see
in
them
a
merlin
who
remembered
all
the
kings
he
ever
saw
and
wished
himself
almost
away
from
vivian
to
make
other
kings
and
shake
the
world
again
in
the
old
manner
i
saw
myself
no
bigger
than
a
beetle
for
several
days
and
wondered
if
your
love
were
large
enough
to
make
me
any
larger
when
you
came
back
am
i
a
beetle
still
she
stood
up
on
her
toes
and
held
her
cheek
for
some
time
against
his
and
let
him
go
i
fear
the
time
has
come
for
me
to
wander
a
little
in
my
he
no
tell
me
everything
that
you
have
seen
and
heard
and
done
and
seen
done
and
heard
done
since
you
deserted
me
and
tell
me
first
what
the
king
thinks
of
me
the
king
believes
that
you
are
almost
what
you
are
he
told
her
the
beauty
of
all
ages
that
are
vanished
reborn
to
be
the
wonder
of
one
woman
i
knew
he
hated
me
what
else
of
him
and
all
that
i
have
seen
and
heard
and
done
which
is
not
much
would
make
a
weary
telling
and
all
your
part
of
it
would
be
to
sleep
and
dream
that
merlin
had
his
beard
again
then
tell
me
more
about
your
good
fool
knight
sir
dagonet
if
blaise
were
not
already
with
his
pondering
on
the
name
and
shield
of
his
unshielding
nameless
father
i
make
a
fool
of
him
i
call
him
ajax
i
have
him
shake
his
fist
at
and
dance
a
jig
as
long
as
there
was
lightning
and
so
till
i
forgot
myself
entirely
not
even
your
love
may
do
so
much
as
that
thunder
and
lightning
are
no
friends
of
mine
said
merlin
slowly
more
than
they
are
yours
they
bring
me
nearer
to
the
elements
from
which
i
came
than
i
care
now
to
be
you
owe
a
service
to
those
elements
for
by
their
service
you
outwitted
age
and
made
the
world
a
kingdom
of
your
will
he
touched
her
hand
smiling
whatever
service
of
mine
awaits
them
will
not
be
forgotten
he
said
and
the
smile
faded
on
his
face
now
of
all
graceless
and
ungrateful
wizards
but
there
she
ceased
for
she
found
in
his
eyes
the
first
of
a
new
fear
the
wrong
word
rules
today
she
said
and
we
have
no
more
journeys
although
he
wandered
rather
more
than
ever
since
he
had
come
again
to
brittany
from
camelot
merlin
found
eternally
before
him
a
new
loneliness
that
made
of
garden
park
and
woodland
all
alike
a
desolation
and
a
changelessness
defying
reason
without
vivian
beside
him
like
a
child
with
a
black
head
or
moving
on
before
him
or
somewhere
so
near
him
that
although
he
saw
it
not
with
eyes
he
felt
the
picture
of
her
beauty
and
shivered
at
the
nearness
of
her
being
without
her
now
there
was
no
past
or
future
and
a
vague
premonition
he
found
the
only
tenant
of
the
present
he
wondered
when
she
was
away
from
him
if
his
avenging
injured
intellect
might
shine
with
arthur
kingdom
a
twin
mirror
fate
plaything
for
new
ages
without
eyes
to
see
therein
themselves
and
their
declension
love
made
his
hours
a
martyrdom
without
her
the
world
was
like
an
empty
house
without
her
where
merlin
was
a
prisoner
of
love
confined
within
himself
by
too
much
freedom
repeating
an
unending
exploration
of
many
solitary
silent
rooms
and
only
in
a
way
remembering
now
that
once
their
very
solitude
and
silence
had
by
the
magic
of
expectancy
made
sure
what
now
he
doubted
though
his
doubts
day
after
day
were
founded
on
a
shadow
for
now
to
merlin
in
his
paradise
had
come
an
unseen
angel
with
a
sword
unseen
the
touch
of
which
was
a
long
fear
for
longer
sorrow
that
had
never
come
yet
might
if
he
compelled
it
he
discovered
one
golden
day
in
autumn
as
he
wandered
that
he
had
made
the
radiance
of
two
years
a
misty
twilight
when
he
might
as
well
have
had
no
mist
between
him
and
the
sun
the
sun
being
vivian
on
his
coming
then
to
find
her
all
in
green
against
a
wall
of
green
and
yellow
leaves
and
crumbling
bread
for
birds
around
the
fountain
while
she
sang
and
the
birds
ate
the
bread
he
told
himself
that
everything
today
was
as
it
was
at
first
and
for
a
minute
he
believed
it
i
have
you
always
all
in
green
out
here
he
said
if
i
had
much
to
say
about
it
she
clapped
her
crumbs
away
and
laughed
at
him
i
covered
up
my
bones
with
every
color
that
i
can
carry
on
them
without
screaming
and
you
have
liked
them
all
or
made
me
think
so
i
must
have
liked
them
if
you
thought
i
did
he
answered
sighing
but
the
sight
of
you
today
as
on
the
day
i
saw
you
first
all
green
all
wonderful
he
tore
a
leaf
to
pieces
with
a
melancholy
care
that
made
her
why
pause
at
you
hardly
been
yourself
since
you
came
back
from
camelot
where
that
unpleasant
king
said
things
that
you
have
never
said
to
me
he
looked
upon
her
with
a
worn
reproach
the
king
said
nothing
that
i
keep
from
you
what
is
it
then
she
asked
imploringly
you
man
of
moods
and
miracles
what
is
it
he
shook
his
head
and
tore
another
leaf
there
is
no
need
of
asking
what
it
is
whatever
you
or
i
may
choose
to
name
it
the
name
of
it
is
fate
who
played
with
me
and
gave
me
eyes
to
read
of
the
unwritten
more
lines
than
i
have
read
i
see
no
more
today
than
yesterday
but
i
remember
my
ways
are
not
the
ways
of
other
men
my
memories
go
forward
it
was
you
who
said
that
we
were
not
in
tune
with
time
it
was
not
i
who
said
it
but
you
knew
it
what
matter
then
who
said
it
it
was
you
who
said
that
merlin
was
your
punishment
for
being
in
tune
with
him
and
not
with
time
with
time
or
with
the
world
and
it
was
you
who
said
you
were
alone
even
here
with
merlin
it
was
not
i
who
said
it
it
is
i
who
tell
you
now
my
inmost
thoughts
he
laughed
as
if
at
hidden
pain
around
his
heart
but
there
was
not
much
laughing
in
his
eyes
they
walked
and
for
a
season
they
were
silent
i
shall
know
what
you
mean
by
that
she
said
when
you
have
told
me
here
an
oak
you
like
and
here
a
place
that
fits
me
wondrous
well
to
sit
in
you
sit
there
i
seen
you
there
before
and
i
have
spoiled
your
noble
thoughts
by
walking
all
my
fingers
up
and
down
your
countenance
as
if
they
were
the
feet
of
a
small
animal
with
no
great
claws
tell
me
a
story
now
about
the
world
and
the
men
in
it
what
they
do
in
it
and
why
it
is
they
do
it
all
so
badly
i
told
you
every
story
that
i
know
almost
he
o
do
begin
like
that
well
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
king
that
has
a
more
commendable
address
go
on
and
tell
me
all
about
the
king
i
bet
the
king
had
warts
or
carbuncles
or
something
wrong
in
his
divine
insides
to
make
him
wish
that
adam
had
died
young
merlin
observed
her
slowly
with
a
frown
of
saddened
wonder
she
laughed
rather
lightly
and
at
his
heart
he
felt
again
the
sword
whose
touch
was
a
long
fear
for
longer
sorrow
well
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
king
he
said
again
but
now
in
a
dry
voice
that
wavered
and
betrayed
a
venturing
he
paused
and
would
have
hesitated
longer
but
something
in
him
that
was
not
himself
compelled
an
utterance
that
his
tongue
obeyed
as
an
unwilling
child
obeys
a
father
who
might
be
richer
for
obedience
if
he
obeyed
the
child
there
was
a
king
who
would
have
made
his
reign
a
monument
for
kings
and
peoples
of
the
waiting
ages
to
reverence
and
remember
and
to
this
end
he
coveted
and
won
with
no
ado
to
make
a
story
of
a
neighbor
queen
who
limed
him
with
her
smile
and
had
of
him
in
token
of
their
sin
what
he
found
soon
to
be
a
sort
of
mongrel
son
and
nephew
and
a
most
precious
reptile
in
addition
to
ornament
his
court
and
carry
arms
and
latterly
to
be
the
darker
half
of
ruin
also
the
king
who
made
of
love
more
than
he
made
of
life
and
death
together
forgot
the
world
and
his
example
in
it
for
yet
another
woman
one
of
many
and
this
one
he
made
queen
albeit
he
knew
that
her
unsworn
allegiance
to
the
knight
that
he
had
loved
the
best
of
all
his
order
must
one
day
bring
along
the
coming
end
of
love
and
honor
and
of
everything
and
with
a
kingdom
builded
on
two
pits
of
living
sin
so
founded
by
the
will
of
one
wise
counsellor
who
loved
the
king
and
loved
the
world
and
therefore
made
him
king
to
be
a
mirror
for
it
the
king
reigned
well
for
certain
years
awaiting
a
sure
doom
for
certain
years
he
waved
across
the
world
a
royal
banner
with
a
dragon
on
it
and
men
of
every
land
fell
worshipping
the
dragon
as
it
were
the
living
god
and
not
the
living
sin
she
rose
at
that
and
after
a
calm
yawn
she
looked
at
merlin
why
all
this
new
insistence
upon
sin
she
said
i
wonder
if
i
understand
this
king
of
yours
with
all
his
pits
and
dragons
i
know
i
do
not
like
him
a
thinner
light
was
in
her
eyes
than
he
had
found
in
them
since
he
became
the
willing
prisoner
that
she
had
made
of
him
and
on
her
mouth
lay
now
a
colder
line
of
irony
than
all
his
fears
or
nightmares
could
have
drawn
before
today
what
reason
do
you
know
for
me
to
listen
to
this
king
of
yours
what
reading
has
a
man
of
woman
days
even
though
the
man
be
merlin
and
a
prophet
i
know
no
call
for
you
to
love
the
king
said
merlin
driven
ruinously
along
by
the
vindictive
urging
of
his
fate
i
know
no
call
for
you
to
love
the
king
although
you
serve
him
knowing
not
yet
the
king
you
serve
there
is
no
man
or
any
woman
for
whom
the
story
of
the
living
king
is
not
the
story
of
the
living
sin
i
thought
my
story
was
the
common
one
for
common
recognition
and
regard
then
let
us
have
no
more
of
it
she
said
for
we
are
not
so
common
i
believe
that
we
need
kings
and
pits
and
flags
and
dragons
to
make
us
know
that
we
have
let
the
world
go
by
us
have
you
missed
the
world
so
much
that
you
must
have
it
in
with
all
its
clots
and
wounds
and
bristles
on
to
make
us
happy
like
blaise
with
shouts
and
horns
and
seven
men
triumphant
with
a
most
unlovely
boar
is
there
no
other
story
in
the
world
than
this
one
of
a
man
that
you
made
king
to
be
a
moral
for
the
speckled
ages
you
said
once
long
ago
if
you
remember
are
too
strange
a
lady
to
fear
specks
and
it
was
you
you
said
who
feared
them
not
why
do
you
look
at
me
as
at
a
snake
all
coiled
to
spring
at
you
and
strike
you
dead
i
am
not
going
to
spring
at
you
or
bite
you
i
going
home
and
you
if
you
are
kind
will
have
no
fear
to
wander
for
an
hour
i
sure
the
time
has
come
for
you
to
wander
and
there
may
come
a
time
for
you
to
say
what
most
you
think
it
is
that
we
need
here
to
make
of
this
broceliande
a
refuge
where
two
disheartened
sinners
may
forget
a
world
that
has
today
no
place
for
them
a
melancholy
wave
of
revelation
broke
over
merlin
like
a
rising
sea
long
viewed
unwillingly
and
long
denied
he
saw
what
he
had
seen
but
would
not
feel
till
now
the
bitterness
of
what
he
felt
was
in
his
throat
and
all
the
coldness
of
it
was
on
him
and
around
him
like
a
flood
of
lonelier
memories
than
he
had
said
were
memories
although
he
knew
them
now
for
what
they
were
for
what
his
eyes
had
seen
for
what
his
ears
had
heard
and
what
his
heart
had
felt
with
him
not
knowing
what
it
felt
but
now
he
knew
that
his
cold
angel
name
was
change
and
that
a
mightier
will
than
his
or
vivian
had
ordained
that
he
be
there
to
vivian
he
could
not
say
anything
but
words
that
had
no
more
of
hope
in
them
than
anguish
had
of
peace
i
meant
the
world
i
meant
the
world
he
groaned
not
you
not
me
again
the
frozen
line
of
irony
was
on
her
mouth
he
looked
up
once
at
it
and
then
away
too
fearful
of
her
eyes
to
see
what
he
could
hear
now
in
her
laugh
that
melted
slowly
into
what
she
said
like
snow
in
icy
water
this
world
of
yours
will
surely
be
the
end
of
us
and
why
not
i
overmuch
afraid
we
part
of
it
or
why
do
we
build
walls
up
all
around
us
with
gates
of
iron
that
make
us
think
the
day
of
judgment
coming
when
they
clang
behind
us
and
yet
you
tell
me
that
you
fear
no
specks
with
you
i
never
cared
for
them
enough
to
think
of
them
i
was
too
strange
a
lady
and
your
return
is
now
a
speckled
king
and
something
that
you
call
a
living
sin
that
like
an
uninvited
poor
relation
who
comes
without
a
welcome
rather
late
and
on
a
foundered
horse
specks
what
are
specks
he
gazed
at
her
in
a
forlorn
wonderment
that
made
her
say
you
said
fear
them
not
i
were
king
in
camelot
you
said
might
fear
more
than
specks
have
you
forgotten
do
tell
me
merlin
you
are
growing
old
why
do
you
make
somehow
a
queen
of
me
and
give
me
half
the
world
i
wager
thrushes
that
i
should
reign
with
you
to
turn
the
wheel
as
well
as
any
king
that
ever
was
the
curse
on
me
is
that
i
can
not
serve
a
ruler
who
forgets
that
he
is
king
in
his
bewildered
misery
merlin
then
stared
hard
at
vivian
face
more
like
a
slave
who
sought
for
common
mercy
than
like
merlin
you
speak
a
language
that
was
never
mine
or
i
have
lost
my
wits
why
do
you
seize
the
flimsiest
of
opportunities
to
make
of
what
i
said
another
thing
than
love
or
reason
could
have
let
me
say
or
let
me
fancy
why
do
you
keep
the
truth
so
far
away
from
me
when
all
your
gates
will
open
at
your
word
and
let
me
go
to
some
place
where
no
fear
or
weariness
of
yours
need
ever
dwell
why
does
a
woman
made
otherwise
a
miracle
of
love
and
loveliness
and
of
immortal
beauty
tear
one
word
by
the
roots
out
of
a
thousand
and
worry
it
and
torture
it
and
shake
it
like
a
small
dog
that
has
a
rag
to
play
with
what
coil
of
an
ingenious
destiny
is
this
that
makes
of
what
i
never
meant
a
meaning
as
remote
as
hell
from
heaven
i
do
know
vivian
said
reluctantly
and
half
as
if
in
pain
i
going
home
i
going
home
and
leave
you
here
to
wander
pray
take
your
kings
and
sins
away
somewhere
and
bury
them
and
bury
the
queen
in
also
i
know
this
king
he
lives
in
camelot
and
i
shall
never
like
him
there
are
specks
almost
all
over
him
long
live
the
king
but
not
the
king
who
lives
in
camelot
with
modred
lancelot
and
guinevere
and
all
four
speckled
like
a
merry
nest
of
addled
eggs
together
you
made
him
king
because
you
loved
the
world
and
saw
in
him
from
infancy
a
mirror
for
the
millions
the
world
will
see
itself
in
him
and
then
the
world
will
say
its
prayers
and
wash
its
face
and
build
for
some
new
king
a
new
foundation
long
live
the
king
but
now
i
apprehend
a
time
for
me
to
shudder
and
grow
old
and
garrulous
and
so
become
a
fright
for
blaise
to
take
out
walking
in
warm
weather
should
i
give
way
to
long
considering
of
worlds
you
may
have
lost
while
prisoned
here
with
me
and
my
light
mind
i
contemplate
another
name
for
this
forbidden
place
and
one
more
fitting
tell
me
if
you
find
it
some
fitter
name
than
eden
we
have
had
a
man
and
woman
in
it
for
some
time
and
now
it
seems
we
have
a
tree
of
knowledge
she
looked
up
at
the
branches
overhead
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
then
she
went
away
and
what
was
left
of
merlin
happiness
like
a
disloyal
phantom
followed
her
he
felt
the
sword
of
his
cold
angel
thrust
and
twisted
in
his
heart
as
if
the
end
were
coming
next
but
the
cold
angel
passed
invisibly
and
left
him
desolate
with
misty
brow
and
eyes
the
man
who
sees
may
see
too
far
and
he
may
see
too
late
the
path
he
takes
unseen
he
told
himself
when
he
found
thought
again
the
man
who
sees
may
go
on
seeing
till
the
immortal
flame
that
lights
and
lures
him
folds
him
in
its
heart
and
leaves
of
what
there
was
of
him
to
die
an
item
of
inhospitable
dust
that
love
and
hate
alike
must
hide
away
or
there
may
still
be
charted
for
his
feet
a
dimmer
faring
where
the
touch
of
time
were
like
the
passing
of
a
twilight
moth
from
flower
to
flower
into
oblivion
if
there
were
not
somewhere
a
barren
end
of
moths
and
flowers
and
glimmering
far
away
beyond
a
desert
where
the
flowerless
days
are
told
in
slow
defeats
and
agonies
the
guiding
of
a
nameless
light
that
once
had
made
him
see
too
much
and
has
by
now
revealed
in
death
to
the
undying
child
of
lancelot
the
grail
for
this
pure
light
has
many
rays
to
throw
for
many
men
to
follow
and
the
wise
are
not
all
pure
nor
are
the
pure
all
wise
who
follow
it
there
are
more
rays
than
men
but
let
the
man
who
saw
too
much
and
was
to
drive
himself
from
paradise
play
too
lightly
or
too
long
among
the
moths
and
flowers
he
finds
at
last
there
is
a
dim
way
out
and
he
shall
grope
where
pleasant
shadows
lead
him
to
the
plain
that
has
no
shadow
save
his
own
behind
him
and
there
with
no
complaint
nor
much
regret
shall
he
plod
on
with
death
between
him
now
and
the
far
light
that
guides
him
till
he
falls
and
has
an
empty
thought
of
empty
rest
then
fate
will
put
a
mattock
in
his
hands
and
lash
him
while
he
digs
himself
the
grave
that
is
to
be
the
pallet
and
the
shroud
of
his
poor
blundering
bones
the
man
who
saw
too
much
must
have
an
eye
to
see
at
last
where
fate
has
marked
the
clay
and
he
shall
delve
although
his
hand
may
slacken
and
his
knees
may
rock
without
a
method
as
he
toils
for
there
a
delving
that
is
to
be
done
if
not
for
god
for
man
i
see
the
light
but
i
shall
fall
before
i
come
to
it
for
i
am
old
i
was
young
yesterday
time
hand
that
i
have
held
away
so
long
grips
hard
now
on
my
shoulder
time
has
won
tomorrow
i
shall
say
to
vivian
that
i
am
old
and
gaunt
and
garrulous
and
tell
her
one
more
story
i
am
old
there
were
long
hours
for
merlin
after
that
and
much
long
wandering
in
his
where
now
the
progress
of
each
heavy
step
confirmed
a
stillness
of
impending
change
and
imminent
farewell
to
vivian
ear
there
came
for
many
days
no
other
story
than
merlin
iteration
of
his
love
and
his
departure
from
broceliande
where
merlin
still
remained
in
vivian
eye
there
was
a
quiet
kindness
and
at
times
a
smoky
flash
of
incredulity
that
faded
into
pain
was
this
the
merlin
this
incarnation
of
idolatry
and
all
but
supplicating
deference
this
bowed
and
reverential
contradiction
of
all
her
dreams
and
her
realities
was
this
the
merlin
who
for
years
and
years
before
she
found
him
had
so
made
her
love
him
that
kings
and
princes
thrones
and
diadems
and
honorable
men
who
drowned
themselves
for
love
were
less
to
her
than
was
this
the
merlin
whom
her
fate
had
sent
one
spring
day
to
come
ringing
at
her
gate
bewildering
her
love
with
happy
terror
that
later
was
to
be
all
happiness
was
this
the
merlin
who
had
made
the
world
half
over
and
then
left
it
with
a
laugh
to
be
the
youngest
oldest
weirdest
gayest
and
wisest
and
sometimes
the
foolishest
of
all
the
men
of
her
consideration
was
this
the
man
who
had
made
other
men
as
ordinary
as
arithmetic
was
this
man
merlin
who
came
now
so
slowly
towards
the
fountain
where
she
stood
again
in
shimmering
green
trembling
he
took
her
hands
and
pressed
them
fondly
one
upon
the
other
between
his
i
was
wrong
that
other
day
for
i
have
one
more
story
i
am
old
he
waited
like
one
hungry
for
the
word
not
said
and
she
found
in
his
eyes
a
light
as
patient
as
a
candle
in
a
window
that
looks
upon
the
sea
and
is
a
mark
for
ships
that
have
gone
down
tomorrow
he
said
tomorrow
i
shall
go
away
again
to
camelot
and
i
shall
see
the
king
once
more
and
i
may
come
to
you
again
once
more
and
i
shall
go
away
again
for
ever
there
is
now
no
more
than
that
for
me
to
do
and
i
shall
do
no
more
i
saw
too
much
when
i
saw
camelot
and
i
saw
farther
backward
into
time
and
forward
than
a
man
may
see
and
live
when
i
made
arthur
king
i
saw
too
far
but
not
so
far
as
this
fate
played
with
me
as
i
have
played
with
time
and
time
like
me
being
less
than
fate
will
have
on
me
his
vengeance
on
fate
there
is
no
vengeance
even
for
god
he
drew
her
slowly
into
his
embrace
and
held
her
there
but
when
he
kissed
her
lips
they
were
as
cold
as
leaves
and
had
no
answer
for
time
had
given
him
then
to
prove
his
words
a
frozen
moment
of
a
woman
life
when
merlin
the
next
morning
came
again
in
the
same
pilgrim
robe
that
he
had
worn
while
he
sat
waiting
where
the
outside
the
gate
fell
on
him
and
around
him
grief
came
to
vivian
at
the
sight
of
him
and
like
a
flash
of
a
swift
ugly
knife
a
blinding
fear
came
with
it
are
you
going
she
said
more
with
her
lips
than
with
her
voice
and
he
said
i
am
going
blaise
and
i
are
going
down
together
to
the
shore
and
blaise
is
coming
back
for
this
one
day
be
good
enough
to
spare
him
for
i
like
him
i
tell
you
now
as
once
i
told
the
king
that
i
can
be
no
more
than
what
i
was
and
i
can
say
no
more
than
i
have
said
sometimes
you
told
me
that
i
spoke
too
long
and
sent
me
off
to
wander
that
was
good
i
go
now
for
another
wandering
and
i
pray
god
that
all
be
well
with
you
for
long
there
was
a
whining
in
her
ears
of
distant
wheels
departing
when
it
ceased
she
closed
the
gate
again
so
quietly
that
merlin
could
have
heard
no
sound
of
it
vii
by
merlin
rock
where
dagonet
the
fool
was
given
through
many
a
dying
afternoon
to
sit
and
meditate
on
human
ways
and
ways
divine
gawaine
and
bedivere
stood
silent
gazing
down
on
camelot
the
two
had
risen
and
were
going
home
it
hits
me
sore
gawaine
said
bedivere
to
think
on
all
the
tumult
and
affliction
down
there
and
all
the
noise
and
preparation
that
hums
of
coming
death
and
if
my
fears
be
born
of
reason
of
what
more
than
death
wherefore
i
say
to
you
again
gawaine
to
you
that
this
late
hour
is
not
too
late
for
you
to
change
yourself
and
change
the
king
for
though
the
king
may
love
me
with
a
love
more
tried
and
older
and
more
sure
may
be
than
for
another
for
such
a
time
as
this
the
friend
who
turns
him
to
the
world
again
shall
have
a
tongue
more
gracious
and
an
eye
more
shrewd
than
mine
for
such
a
time
as
this
the
king
must
have
a
glamour
to
persuade
him
the
king
shall
have
a
glamour
and
anon
gawaine
said
and
he
shot
death
from
his
eyes
if
you
were
king
as
arthur
is
or
was
and
lancelot
had
carried
off
your
queen
and
killed
a
score
or
so
of
your
best
knights
not
mentioning
my
two
brothers
whom
he
slew
unarmored
and
unarmed
god
save
your
wits
two
stewards
with
skewers
could
have
done
as
much
and
you
and
i
might
now
be
rotting
for
it
but
lancelot
men
were
crowded
they
were
crushed
and
there
was
nothing
for
them
but
to
strike
or
die
not
seeing
where
they
struck
think
you
they
would
have
slain
gareth
and
gaheris
and
tor
and
all
those
other
friends
of
theirs
god
mercy
for
the
world
he
made
i
say
and
for
the
blood
that
writes
the
story
of
it
gareth
and
gaheris
tor
and
lamorak
all
dead
with
all
the
others
that
are
dead
these
years
have
made
me
turn
to
lamorak
for
counsel
and
now
lamorak
is
dead
why
do
you
fling
those
two
names
in
my
face
was
modred
made
an
end
of
lamorak
not
i
and
lancelot
now
has
done
for
tor
i
urge
no
king
on
after
lancelot
for
such
a
two
as
tor
and
lamorak
their
father
killed
my
father
and
their
friend
was
lancelot
not
i
own
my
fault
i
living
and
while
i
a
tongue
can
talk
i
say
this
to
the
king
lancelot
by
inches
till
he
give
you
back
the
queen
then
hang
him
drown
him
or
do
anything
to
rid
the
world
of
him
he
killed
my
brothers
and
he
was
once
my
friend
now
damn
the
soul
of
him
who
killed
my
brothers
there
you
have
me
you
are
a
strong
man
gawaine
and
your
strength
goes
ill
where
foes
are
you
may
cleave
their
limbs
and
heads
off
but
you
can
not
damn
their
souls
what
you
may
do
now
is
to
save
their
souls
and
bodies
too
and
like
enough
your
own
remember
that
king
arthur
is
a
king
and
where
there
is
a
king
there
is
a
kingdom
is
not
the
kingdom
any
more
to
you
than
one
brief
enemy
would
you
see
it
fall
and
the
king
with
it
for
one
mortal
hate
that
burns
out
reason
gawaine
you
are
king
today
another
day
may
see
no
king
but
havoc
if
you
have
no
other
word
for
arthur
now
than
hate
for
lancelot
is
not
the
world
as
large
as
lancelot
is
lancelot
because
one
woman
eyes
are
brighter
when
they
look
on
him
to
sluice
the
world
with
angry
blood
poor
flesh
poor
flesh
and
you
gawaine
are
you
so
gaffed
with
hate
you
can
not
leave
it
and
so
plunge
away
to
stiller
places
and
there
see
for
once
what
hangs
on
this
pernicious
expedition
the
king
in
his
insane
forgetfulness
would
undertake
with
you
to
drum
him
on
are
you
as
mad
as
he
and
lancelot
made
ravening
into
one
man
twice
as
mad
as
either
is
the
kingdom
of
the
world
now
rocking
to
go
down
in
sound
and
blood
and
ashes
and
sick
ruin
and
for
the
sake
of
three
men
and
a
woman
if
it
be
so
god
mercy
for
the
world
he
made
i
say
and
say
again
to
dagonet
sir
fool
your
throne
is
empty
and
you
may
as
well
sit
on
it
and
be
ruler
of
the
world
from
now
till
sir
dagonet
appearing
made
reply
to
dry
welcome
with
a
famished
look
of
pain
on
which
he
built
a
smile
if
i
were
king
you
bedivere
should
be
my
counsellor
and
we
should
have
no
more
wars
over
women
i
sit
me
down
and
meditate
on
that
gawaine
for
all
his
anger
laughed
a
little
and
clapped
the
fool
lean
shoulder
for
he
loved
him
and
was
with
arthur
when
he
made
him
knight
then
dagonet
said
on
to
bedivere
as
if
his
tongue
would
make
a
jest
of
sorrow
sometime
i
tell
you
what
i
might
have
done
had
i
been
lancelot
and
you
king
arthur
each
having
in
himself
the
vicious
essence
that
now
lives
in
the
other
and
makes
war
when
all
men
are
like
you
and
me
my
lord
when
all
are
rational
or
rickety
there
may
be
no
more
war
but
what
here
now
lancelot
loves
the
queen
and
he
makes
war
of
love
the
king
being
bitten
to
the
soul
by
love
and
hate
that
work
in
him
together
makes
war
of
madness
gawaine
hates
lancelot
and
he
to
be
in
tune
makes
war
of
hate
modred
hates
everything
yet
he
can
see
with
one
damned
illegitimate
small
eye
his
father
crown
and
with
another
like
it
he
sees
the
beauty
of
the
queen
herself
he
needs
the
two
for
his
ambitious
pleasure
and
therefore
he
makes
war
of
his
ambition
and
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
all
this
there
a
squeezed
world
that
elbows
for
attention
poor
merlin
buried
in
broceliande
he
must
have
had
an
academic
eye
for
woman
when
he
founded
arthur
kingdom
and
in
broceliande
he
may
be
sorry
flutes
hautboys
drums
and
viols
god
be
with
him
i
glad
they
tell
me
there
another
world
for
this
one
a
disease
without
a
doctor
no
not
so
bad
as
that
said
bedivere
the
doctor
like
ourselves
may
now
be
learning
and
merlin
may
have
gauged
his
enterprise
whatever
the
cost
he
may
have
paid
for
knowing
we
pass
but
many
are
to
follow
us
and
what
they
build
may
stay
though
i
believe
another
age
will
have
another
merlin
another
camelot
and
another
king
sir
dagonet
farewell
farewell
sir
knight
and
you
sir
knight
gawaine
you
have
the
world
now
in
your
fingers
an
uncommon
toy
albeit
a
small
persuasion
in
the
balance
with
one
man
hate
i
glad
you
not
a
fool
for
then
you
might
be
rickety
as
i
am
and
rational
as
bedivere
farewell
i
sit
here
and
be
king
god
save
the
king
but
gawaine
scowled
and
frowned
and
answered
nothing
as
he
went
slowly
down
with
bedivere
to
camelot
where
arthur
army
waited
the
king
word
for
the
melancholy
march
to
joyous
gard
where
lancelot
hid
the
queen
and
armed
his
host
and
there
was
now
no
joy
as
there
was
now
no
joy
for
dagonet
while
he
sat
brooding
with
his
wan
hooked
with
his
bony
fingers
go
gawaine
he
mumbled
go
your
way
and
drag
the
world
along
down
with
you
what
a
world
or
so
to
you
if
you
can
hide
an
ell
of
iron
somewhere
in
lancelot
and
hear
him
wheeze
and
sputter
once
or
twice
before
he
goes
wherever
the
queen
sends
him
there
a
man
who
should
have
been
a
king
and
would
have
been
had
he
been
born
so
so
should
i
have
been
a
king
had
i
been
born
so
fool
or
no
king
dagonet
or
dagonet
the
king
not
impossible
i
meditate
on
that
and
pray
for
arthur
who
made
me
all
i
am
except
a
fool
now
he
goes
mad
for
love
as
i
might
go
had
i
been
born
a
king
and
not
a
fool
today
i
think
i
rather
be
a
fool
today
the
world
is
less
than
one
scared
woman
wherefore
a
field
of
waving
men
may
soon
be
shorn
by
time
indifferent
scythe
because
the
king
is
mad
the
seeds
of
history
are
small
but
given
a
few
gouts
of
warm
blood
for
quickening
they
sprout
out
wondrously
and
have
a
leaping
growth
whereof
no
man
may
shun
such
harvesting
of
change
or
death
or
life
as
may
fall
on
him
to
be
borne
when
i
am
still
alive
and
rickety
and
bedivere
alive
and
rational
if
he
come
out
of
this
and
there
a
doubt
the
king
gawaine
modred
and
lancelot
may
all
be
lying
underneath
a
weight
of
bloody
sheaves
too
heavy
for
their
shoulders
all
spent
and
all
dishonored
and
all
dead
and
if
it
come
to
be
that
this
be
so
and
it
be
true
that
merlin
saw
the
truth
such
harvest
were
the
best
your
fool
sees
not
so
far
as
merlin
sees
yet
if
he
saw
the
truth
why
then
such
harvest
were
the
best
i
pray
for
arthur
i
can
do
no
more
why
not
for
merlin
or
do
you
count
him
in
this
extreme
so
foreign
to
salvation
that
prayer
would
be
a
stranger
to
his
name
poor
dagonet
with
terror
shaking
him
stood
up
and
saw
before
him
an
old
face
made
older
with
an
inch
of
silver
beard
and
faded
eyes
more
eloquent
of
pain
and
ruin
than
all
the
faded
eyes
of
age
till
now
had
ever
been
although
in
them
there
was
a
mystic
and
intrinsic
peace
of
one
who
sees
where
men
of
nearer
sight
see
nothing
on
their
way
to
camelot
gawaine
and
bedivere
had
passed
him
by
with
lax
attention
for
the
pilgrim
cloak
they
passed
and
what
it
hid
yet
merlin
saw
their
faces
and
he
saw
the
tale
was
true
that
he
had
lately
drawn
from
solemn
strangers
well
dagonet
and
by
your
leave
he
said
i
rest
my
lonely
relics
for
a
while
on
this
rock
that
was
mine
and
now
is
yours
i
favor
the
succession
for
you
know
far
more
than
many
doctors
though
your
doubt
is
your
peculiar
poison
i
foresaw
long
since
and
i
have
latterly
been
told
what
moves
in
this
commotion
down
below
to
show
men
what
it
means
it
means
the
end
if
men
whose
tongues
had
less
to
say
to
me
than
had
their
shoulders
are
adept
enough
to
know
and
you
may
pray
for
me
or
not
sir
friend
sir
dagonet
sir
fool
you
mean
dagonet
said
and
gazed
on
merlin
sadly
i
never
pray
again
for
anything
and
last
of
all
for
this
that
you
behold
the
smouldering
faggot
of
unlovely
bones
that
god
has
given
to
me
to
call
myself
when
merlin
comes
to
dagonet
for
prayer
it
is
indeed
the
end
and
in
the
end
are
more
beginnings
dagonet
than
men
shall
name
or
know
today
it
was
the
end
of
arthur
insubstantial
majesty
when
to
him
and
his
knights
the
grail
foreshowed
the
quest
of
life
that
was
to
be
the
death
of
many
and
the
slow
discouraging
of
many
more
or
do
i
err
in
this
no
dagonet
replied
there
was
a
light
and
galahad
in
the
siege
perilous
alone
of
all
on
whom
it
fell
was
calm
there
was
a
light
wherein
men
saw
themselves
in
one
another
as
they
might
become
or
so
they
dreamed
there
was
a
long
and
gawaine
of
all
forlorn
ineligibles
rose
up
the
first
and
cried
more
lustily
than
any
after
him
that
he
should
find
the
grail
or
die
for
it
though
he
did
neither
for
he
came
back
as
living
and
as
fit
for
new
and
old
iniquity
as
ever
then
lancelot
came
back
and
bors
came
back
like
men
who
had
seen
more
than
men
should
see
and
still
come
back
they
told
of
percival
who
saw
too
much
to
make
of
this
worn
life
a
long
necessity
and
of
galahad
who
died
and
is
alive
they
all
saw
something
god
knows
the
meaning
or
the
end
of
it
but
they
saw
something
and
if
i
an
eye
small
joy
has
the
queen
been
to
lancelot
since
he
came
back
from
seeing
what
he
saw
for
though
his
passion
hold
him
like
hot
claws
he
neither
in
the
world
nor
out
of
it
gawaine
is
king
though
arthur
wears
the
crown
and
gawaine
hate
for
lancelot
is
the
sword
that
hangs
by
one
of
merlin
fragile
hairs
above
the
world
were
you
to
see
the
king
the
frenzy
that
has
overthrown
his
wisdom
instead
of
him
and
his
upheaving
empire
might
have
an
end
i
came
to
see
the
king
said
merlin
like
a
man
who
labors
hard
and
long
with
an
importunate
confession
no
dagonet
you
can
not
tell
me
why
although
your
tongue
is
eager
with
wild
hope
to
tell
me
more
than
i
may
tell
myself
about
myself
all
this
that
was
to
be
might
show
to
man
how
vain
it
were
to
wreck
the
world
for
self
if
it
were
all
in
vain
when
i
began
with
arthur
i
could
see
in
each
bewildered
man
who
dots
the
earth
a
moment
with
his
days
a
groping
thought
of
an
eternal
will
strangely
endowed
with
merciful
illusions
whereby
self
becomes
the
will
itself
and
each
man
swells
in
fond
accordance
with
his
agency
now
arthur
modred
lancelot
and
gawaine
are
swollen
thoughts
of
this
eternal
will
which
have
no
other
way
to
find
the
way
that
leads
them
on
to
their
inheritance
than
by
the
flame
of
a
wrecked
empire
lighted
by
the
torch
of
woman
who
together
with
the
light
that
galahad
found
is
yet
to
light
the
world
a
wan
smile
crept
across
the
weary
face
of
dagonet
the
fool
if
you
knew
that
before
your
burial
in
broceliande
no
wonder
your
eternal
will
accords
with
all
your
dreams
of
what
the
world
requires
my
master
i
may
say
this
unto
you
because
i
am
a
fool
and
fear
no
man
my
fear
is
that
i
been
a
groping
thought
that
never
swelled
enough
you
say
the
torch
of
woman
and
the
light
that
galahad
found
are
some
day
to
illuminate
the
world
i
meditate
on
that
the
world
is
done
for
me
and
i
have
been
to
make
men
laugh
a
lean
thing
of
no
shape
and
many
capers
i
made
them
laugh
and
i
could
laugh
anon
myself
to
see
them
killing
one
another
because
a
woman
with
hair
has
pranked
a
man
with
horns
was
but
a
flash
of
chance
and
lancelot
the
other
day
that
saved
this
pleasing
sinner
from
the
fire
that
she
may
spread
for
thousands
were
she
now
the
cinder
the
king
willed
or
were
you
now
to
see
the
king
the
fire
might
yet
go
out
but
the
eternal
will
says
otherwise
so
be
it
i
assemble
certain
gold
that
i
may
say
is
mine
and
get
myself
away
from
this
accurst
unhappy
court
and
in
some
quiet
place
where
shepherd
clowns
and
cowherds
may
have
more
respondent
ears
than
kings
and
i
shall
troll
old
men
to
easy
graves
and
be
a
child
again
among
the
children
of
the
earth
i
have
no
more
of
kings
even
though
i
loved
king
arthur
who
is
mad
as
i
could
love
no
other
man
save
merlin
who
is
dead
not
wholly
dead
but
old
merlin
is
old
the
wizard
shivered
as
he
spoke
and
stared
away
into
the
sunset
where
he
saw
once
more
as
through
a
cracked
and
cloudy
glass
a
crumbling
sky
that
held
a
crimson
cloud
wherein
there
was
a
town
of
many
towers
all
swayed
and
shaken
in
a
woman
hand
this
time
till
out
of
it
there
spilled
and
flashed
and
tumbled
like
loose
jewels
town
towers
and
walls
and
there
was
nothing
but
a
crumbling
sky
that
made
anon
of
black
and
red
and
ruin
a
wild
and
final
rain
on
camelot
he
bowed
and
pressed
his
eyes
now
by
my
soul
i
have
seen
this
before
all
black
and
red
like
that
like
that
like
vivian
black
and
red
like
vivian
when
her
eyes
looked
into
mine
across
the
cups
of
gold
a
flute
was
playing
then
all
was
black
and
red
another
smile
crept
over
the
wan
face
of
dagonet
who
shivered
in
his
turn
the
torch
of
woman
he
muttered
and
the
light
that
galahad
found
will
some
day
save
us
all
as
they
saved
merlin
forgive
my
shivering
wits
but
i
am
cold
and
it
will
soon
be
dark
will
you
go
down
with
me
to
see
the
king
or
will
you
not
if
not
i
go
tomorrow
to
the
shepherds
the
world
is
mad
and
i
a
groping
thought
of
your
eternal
will
the
world
and
i
are
strangers
and
i
have
no
more
of
it
except
you
go
with
me
to
see
the
king
no
dagonet
you
can
not
leave
me
now
said
merlin
sadly
you
and
i
are
old
and
as
you
say
we
fear
no
man
god
knows
i
would
not
have
the
love
that
once
you
had
for
me
be
fear
of
me
for
i
am
past
all
fearing
now
but
fate
may
send
a
fly
sometimes
and
he
may
sting
us
to
the
grave
so
driven
to
test
our
faith
in
what
we
see
are
you
now
i
am
coming
to
an
end
as
arthur
days
are
coming
to
an
end
to
sting
me
like
a
fly
i
do
not
ask
of
you
to
say
that
you
see
what
i
see
where
you
see
nothing
nor
do
i
require
of
any
man
more
vision
than
is
his
yet
i
could
wish
for
you
a
larger
part
for
your
last
entrance
here
than
this
you
play
tonight
of
a
sad
insect
stinging
merlin
the
more
you
sting
the
more
he
pities
you
and
you
were
never
overfond
of
pity
had
you
been
so
i
doubt
if
arthur
love
or
gawaine
would
have
made
of
you
a
knight
no
dagonet
you
can
not
leave
me
now
nor
would
you
if
you
could
you
call
yourself
a
fool
because
the
world
and
you
are
strangers
you
are
a
proud
man
dagonet
you
have
suffered
what
i
alone
have
seen
you
are
no
fool
and
surely
you
are
not
a
fly
to
sting
my
love
to
last
regret
believe
or
not
what
i
have
seen
or
what
i
say
to
you
but
say
no
more
to
me
that
i
am
dead
because
the
king
is
mad
and
you
are
old
and
i
am
older
in
broceliande
time
overtook
me
as
i
knew
he
must
and
i
with
a
fond
overplus
of
words
had
warned
the
lady
vivian
already
before
these
wrinkles
and
this
hesitancy
inhibiting
my
joints
oppressed
her
sight
with
age
and
dissolution
she
said
once
that
she
was
cold
and
cruel
but
she
meant
that
she
was
warm
and
kind
and
for
woman
in
a
world
where
men
see
not
beyond
themselves
she
saw
beyond
them
all
as
i
did
and
she
waited
as
i
did
the
coming
of
a
day
when
were
to
fall
down
all
over
me
like
snow
in
springtime
i
was
far
from
camelot
that
afternoon
and
i
am
farther
now
from
her
i
see
no
more
for
me
to
do
than
to
leave
her
and
arthur
and
the
world
behind
me
and
to
pray
that
all
be
well
with
vivian
whose
unquiet
heart
is
hungry
for
what
is
not
and
what
shall
never
be
without
her
in
a
world
that
men
are
making
knowing
not
how
nor
caring
yet
to
know
how
slowly
and
how
grievously
they
do
it
though
vivian
in
her
golden
shell
of
exile
knows
now
and
cares
not
knowing
that
she
cares
nor
caring
that
she
knows
in
time
to
be
the
like
of
her
shall
have
another
name
than
vivian
and
her
laugh
shall
be
a
fire
not
shining
only
to
consume
itself
with
what
it
burns
she
knows
not
yet
the
name
of
what
she
is
for
now
there
is
no
name
some
day
there
shall
be
time
has
many
names
unwritten
yet
for
what
we
say
is
old
because
we
are
so
young
that
it
seems
old
and
this
is
all
a
part
of
what
i
saw
before
you
saw
king
arthur
when
we
parted
i
told
her
i
should
see
the
king
again
and
having
seen
him
might
go
back
again
to
see
her
face
once
more
but
i
shall
see
no
more
the
lady
vivian
let
her
love
what
man
she
may
no
other
love
than
mine
shall
be
an
index
of
her
memories
i
fear
no
man
who
may
come
after
me
and
i
see
none
i
see
her
still
in
green
beside
the
fountain
i
shall
not
go
back
we
pay
for
going
back
and
all
we
get
is
one
more
needless
ounce
of
weary
wisdom
to
bring
away
with
us
if
i
come
not
the
lady
vivian
will
remember
me
and
say
knew
him
when
his
heart
was
young
though
i
have
lost
him
now
time
called
him
home
and
that
was
as
it
was
for
much
is
lost
between
broceliande
and
camelot
he
stared
away
into
the
west
again
where
now
no
crimson
cloud
or
phantom
town
deceived
his
eyes
above
a
living
town
there
were
gray
clouds
and
ultimate
suspense
and
a
cold
wind
was
coming
dagonet
now
crouched
at
merlin
feet
in
his
dejection
saw
multiplying
lights
far
down
below
where
lay
the
fevered
streets
at
length
he
felt
on
his
lean
shoulder
merlin
tragic
hand
and
trembled
knowing
that
a
few
more
days
would
see
the
last
of
arthur
and
the
first
of
modred
whose
dark
patience
had
attained
to
one
precarious
half
of
what
he
sought
and
even
the
queen
herself
may
fall
to
him
dagonet
the
queen
fall
to
modred
is
that
your
only
fear
tonight
said
merlin
she
may
but
not
for
long
no
not
my
fear
for
i
fear
nothing
but
i
wish
no
fate
like
that
for
any
woman
the
king
loves
although
she
be
the
scourge
and
end
of
him
that
you
saw
coming
as
i
see
it
now
dagonet
shook
but
he
would
have
no
tears
he
swore
for
any
king
queen
knave
or
wizard
albeit
he
was
a
stranger
among
those
who
laughed
at
him
because
he
was
a
fool
you
said
the
truth
i
can
not
leave
you
now
he
stammered
and
was
angry
for
the
tears
that
mocked
his
will
and
choked
him
merlin
smiled
faintly
and
for
the
moment
dagonet
i
need
your
word
as
one
of
arthur
knights
that
you
will
go
on
with
me
to
the
end
of
my
short
way
and
say
unto
no
man
or
woman
that
you
found
or
saw
me
here
no
good
would
follow
for
a
doubt
would
live
unstifled
of
my
loyalty
to
him
whose
deeds
are
wrought
for
those
who
are
to
come
and
many
who
see
not
what
i
have
seen
or
what
you
see
tonight
would
prattle
on
for
ever
and
their
children
after
them
of
what
might
once
have
been
had
i
gone
down
with
you
to
camelot
to
see
the
king
i
came
to
see
the
king
but
why
see
kings
all
this
that
was
to
be
is
what
i
saw
before
there
was
an
arthur
to
be
king
and
so
to
be
a
mirror
wherein
men
may
see
themselves
and
pause
if
they
see
not
or
if
they
do
see
and
they
ponder
not
i
saw
but
i
was
neither
fate
nor
god
i
saw
too
much
and
this
would
be
the
end
were
there
to
be
an
end
i
saw
myself
a
sight
no
other
man
has
ever
seen
and
through
the
dark
that
lay
beyond
myself
i
saw
two
fires
that
are
to
light
the
world
on
dagonet
the
silent
hand
of
merlin
weighed
now
as
living
iron
that
held
him
down
with
a
primeval
power
doubt
wonderment
impatience
and
a
sorrow
born
of
an
ancient
love
possessed
and
held
him
until
his
love
was
more
than
he
could
name
and
he
was
merlin
fool
not
arthur
now
say
what
you
will
i
say
that
i
the
fool
of
merlin
king
of
nowhere
which
is
here
with
you
for
king
and
me
for
court
what
else
have
we
to
sigh
for
but
a
place
to
sleep
i
know
a
tavern
that
will
take
us
in
and
on
the
morrow
i
shall
follow
you
until
i
die
for
you
and
when
i
die
well
dagonet
the
king
is
listening
and
dagonet
answered
hearing
in
the
words
of
merlin
a
grave
humor
and
a
sound
of
graver
pity
i
shall
die
a
fool
he
heard
what
might
have
been
a
father
laugh
faintly
behind
him
and
the
living
weight
of
merlin
hand
was
lifted
they
arose
and
saying
nothing
found
a
groping
way
down
through
the
gloom
together
fiercer
now
the
wind
was
like
a
flying
animal
that
beat
the
two
of
them
incessantly
with
icy
wings
and
bit
them
as
they
went
the
rock
above
them
was
an
empty
place
where
neither
seer
nor
fool
should
view
again
the
stricken
city
colder
blew
the
wind
across
the
world
and
on
it
heavier
lay
the
shadow
and
the
burden
of
the
night
and
there
was
darkness
over
camelot
printed
in
the
united
states
of
america
