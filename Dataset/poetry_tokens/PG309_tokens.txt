are
a
part
of
me
i
fellow
to
the
trees
my
golden
youth
i
squandering
am
i
until
the
day
i
i
was
once
i
declare
a
man
and
i
roomed
in
the
cool
of
a
cave
i
have
known
i
will
swear
in
a
new
the
fret
and
the
sweat
of
a
slave
for
far
over
all
that
folks
hold
worth
there
lives
and
there
leaps
in
me
a
love
of
the
lowly
things
of
earth
and
a
passion
to
be
free
to
pitch
my
tent
with
no
prosy
plan
to
range
and
to
change
at
will
to
mock
at
the
mastership
of
man
to
seek
adventure
thrill
carefree
to
be
as
a
bird
that
sings
to
go
my
own
sweet
way
to
reck
not
at
all
what
may
befall
but
to
live
and
to
love
each
day
to
make
my
body
a
temple
pure
wherein
i
dwell
serene
to
care
for
the
things
that
shall
endure
the
simple
sweet
and
clean
to
oust
out
envy
and
hate
and
rage
to
breathe
with
no
alarm
for
nature
shall
be
my
anchorage
and
none
shall
do
me
harm
to
shun
all
lures
that
debauch
the
soul
the
orgied
rites
of
the
rich
to
eat
my
crust
as
a
rover
must
with
the
down
in
the
ditch
to
trudge
by
his
side
betide
to
share
his
fire
at
night
to
call
him
friend
to
the
long
and
to
read
his
heart
aright
to
scorn
all
strife
and
to
view
all
life
with
the
curious
eyes
of
a
child
from
the
plangent
sea
to
the
prairie
from
the
slum
to
the
heart
of
the
wild
from
the
star
to
the
speck
of
sand
from
the
vast
to
the
greatly
small
for
i
know
that
the
whole
for
good
is
planned
and
i
want
to
see
it
all
to
see
it
all
the
wide
from
the
belt
to
the
pole
with
never
a
one
to
say
me
nay
and
none
to
cramp
my
soul
in
i
will
pay
the
price
but
god
let
me
be
free
for
once
i
know
in
the
long
ago
they
made
a
slave
of
me
in
a
flannel
shirt
from
earth
clean
dirt
here
pal
is
my
calloused
hand
oh
i
love
each
day
as
a
rover
may
nor
seek
to
understand
to
is
good
enough
for
me
the
gipsy
of
god
am
i
then
here
a
hail
to
each
flaring
dawn
and
here
a
cheer
to
the
night
that
gone
and
may
i
go
on
until
the
day
i
die
every
star
shall
sing
to
me
its
song
of
liberty
and
every
morn
shall
bring
to
me
its
mandate
to
be
free
in
every
throbbing
vein
of
me
i
feel
the
vast
o
body
heart
and
brain
of
me
praise
him
who
made
it
all
the
soldier
of
fortune
deny
your
god
they
ringed
me
with
their
spears
were
they
and
reeking
from
the
strife
their
hate
and
their
sneers
and
one
man
spat
on
me
and
nursed
a
knife
and
there
was
i
sore
wounded
and
alone
i
the
last
living
of
my
slaughtered
band
oh
sinister
the
sky
and
cold
as
stone
in
one
red
laugh
of
horror
reeled
the
land
and
dazed
and
desperate
i
faced
their
spears
and
like
a
flame
that
naked
knife
and
like
a
serpent
stung
their
bitter
jeers
deny
your
god
and
we
will
give
you
life
deny
my
god
oh
life
was
very
sweet
and
it
is
hard
in
youth
and
hope
to
die
and
there
my
comrades
dear
lay
at
my
feet
and
in
that
blear
of
blood
soon
must
i
lie
and
yet
i
almost
laughed
it
seemed
so
odd
for
long
and
long
had
i
not
vainly
tried
to
reason
out
and
body
forth
my
god
and
prayed
for
light
and
doubted
and
denied
the
being
i
could
not
conceive
denied
a
beyond
the
and
now
they
ask
me
who
do
not
believe
just
to
deny
to
voice
my
doubt
to
save
this
life
of
mine
that
sings
so
in
the
sun
the
bloom
of
youth
yet
red
upon
my
cheek
my
only
life
o
fools
is
easy
done
i
will
deny
and
yet
i
do
not
speak
deny
your
god
their
spears
are
all
agleam
and
i
can
see
their
eyes
with
shine
their
snarling
voices
shrill
into
a
scream
and
mad
to
slay
they
quiver
for
the
sign
deny
my
god
yes
i
could
do
it
well
yet
if
i
did
what
of
my
race
my
name
how
they
would
spit
on
me
these
dogs
of
hell
spurn
me
and
put
on
me
the
brand
of
shame
a
white
man
honour
what
of
that
i
say
shall
these
black
curs
cry
coward
in
my
face
they
who
would
perish
for
their
gods
of
clay
shall
i
defile
my
country
and
my
race
my
country
what
my
country
to
me
now
soldier
of
fortune
free
and
far
i
roam
all
men
are
brothers
in
my
heart
i
vow
the
wide
and
wondrous
world
is
all
my
home
my
country
reverent
of
her
splendid
dead
her
heroes
proud
her
martyrs
pierced
with
pain
for
me
her
puissant
blood
was
vainly
shed
for
me
her
drums
of
battle
beat
in
vain
and
free
i
fare
of
her
fate
no
faith
no
flag
i
owe
then
why
not
seek
this
last
of
life
why
hesitate
i
will
deny
and
yet
i
do
not
speak
deny
your
god
their
spears
are
poised
on
high
and
tense
and
terrible
they
wait
the
word
and
dark
and
darker
glooms
the
dreary
sky
and
in
that
hush
of
horror
no
thing
stirred
then
through
the
ringing
terror
and
sheer
hate
leaped
there
a
vision
to
me
oh
how
far
a
face
her
face
through
all
my
stormy
fate
a
joy
a
strength
a
glory
and
a
star
beneath
the
pines
where
lonely
gleam
in
seas
forlorn
amid
the
deserts
drear
how
i
had
gladdened
to
that
face
of
dream
and
never
never
had
it
seemed
so
dear
o
silken
hair
that
veils
the
sunny
brow
o
eyes
of
grey
so
tender
and
so
true
o
lips
of
smiling
sweetness
must
i
now
for
ever
and
for
ever
go
from
you
ah
yes
i
must
for
if
i
do
this
thing
how
can
i
look
into
your
face
again
knowing
you
think
me
more
than
half
a
king
i
with
my
craven
heart
my
honour
slain
no
no
my
mind
made
up
i
gaze
above
into
that
sky
insensate
as
a
stone
not
for
my
creed
my
country
but
my
love
will
i
stand
up
and
meet
my
death
alone
then
though
it
be
to
utter
dark
i
sink
the
god
that
dwells
in
me
is
not
denied
best
triumphs
over
beast
and
so
i
think
humanity
itself
is
and
now
my
butchers
i
embrace
my
fate
come
let
my
heart
blood
slake
the
thirsty
sod
curst
be
the
life
you
offer
glut
your
hate
strike
strike
you
dogs
i
deny
my
god
i
saw
the
spears
that
seemed
to
slay
all
quiver
earthward
at
the
headman
nod
and
in
a
daze
of
dream
i
heard
him
say
go
set
him
free
who
serves
so
well
his
god
the
gramaphone
at
now
eddie
malone
got
a
swell
grammyfone
to
draw
all
the
trade
to
his
store
an
sez
he
come
along
for
a
season
of
song
which
the
like
ye
had
niver
before
then
dogrib
an
slave
an
brave
an
cree
in
his
dinky
canoe
confluated
near
to
see
an
to
hear
ed
grammyfone
make
its
dayboo
then
ed
turned
the
crank
an
there
on
the
bank
they
squatted
like
bumps
on
a
log
for
acres
around
there
was
a
sound
not
even
the
howl
of
a
dog
when
out
of
the
horn
there
sudden
was
born
such
a
marvellous
elegant
tone
an
then
like
a
spell
on
that
auddyence
fell
the
voice
of
its
first
grammyfone
medicine
cried
old
tom
the
an
made
for
to
jump
in
the
lake
but
no
one
gave
heed
to
his
little
stampede
so
he
guessed
he
had
made
a
mistake
then
a
chief
of
the
blood
observed
in
choice
chippewayan
you
brought
us
canned
beef
an
it
now
my
belief
that
this
here
a
case
of
well
though
i
not
strong
on
the
dago
in
song
that
sure
got
me
goin
for
fair
there
was
crusoe
an
scotty
an
shoeman
hank
an
melber
an
bonchy
was
there
was
silver
an
gold
an
sweetness
untold
to
hear
all
them
big
guinneys
sing
an
thick
all
around
an
inhalin
the
sound
them
indians
formed
in
a
ring
so
solemn
they
sat
an
they
smoked
an
they
spat
but
their
eyes
sort
o
glistened
an
shone
yet
niver
a
word
of
approvin
occurred
till
that
guy
harry
lauder
came
on
then
hunter
of
moose
an
squaw
an
papoose
jest
laughed
till
their
stummicks
was
sore
six
times
eddie
set
back
that
record
an
yet
they
hollered
an
hollered
for
more
i
never
forget
that
you
bet
them
caverns
of
sunset
agleam
them
still
peaks
aglow
them
shadders
below
an
the
lake
like
a
petrified
dream
the
teepees
that
stood
by
the
edge
of
the
wood
the
evenin
star
blinkin
alone
the
peace
an
the
rest
an
final
an
best
the
music
of
ed
grammyfone
then
sudden
an
clear
there
rang
on
my
ear
a
song
mighty
simple
an
old
an
high
it
thrilled
to
the
sky
all
about
silver
threads
in
the
gold
was
tender
to
tears
an
it
brung
back
the
years
the
that
hallow
an
yearn
was
an
joy
was
the
thought
of
my
boy
an
right
there
i
vowed
i
return
big
jack
was
right
at
my
back
an
i
saw
with
a
kind
o
surprise
he
gazed
at
the
lake
with
a
heartful
of
ache
an
the
tears
irrigated
his
eyes
an
sez
he
cuss
me
pard
but
that
there
hits
me
hard
i
a
mother
does
nuthin
but
wait
she
turned
an
she
only
got
me
an
i
scared
it
soon
be
too
late
on
shore
i
hearin
once
more
that
blessed
old
grammyfone
play
the
summer
all
gone
an
i
still
livin
on
in
the
same
old
haphazardous
way
oh
i
cut
out
the
booze
an
with
muscles
an
thews
i
corralled
all
the
coin
to
go
back
but
it
was
to
be
he
a
mother
you
see
so
i
it
to
the
land
of
beyond
have
ever
you
heard
of
the
land
of
beyond
that
dreams
at
the
gates
of
the
day
alluring
it
lies
at
the
skirts
of
the
skies
and
ever
so
far
away
alluring
it
calls
o
ye
the
yoke
galls
and
ye
of
the
trail
overfond
with
saddle
and
pack
by
paddle
and
track
let
go
to
the
land
of
beyond
have
ever
you
stood
where
the
silences
brood
and
vast
the
horizons
begin
at
the
dawn
of
the
day
to
behold
far
away
the
goal
you
would
strive
for
and
win
yet
ah
in
the
night
when
you
gain
to
the
height
with
the
vast
pool
of
heaven
afar
and
agleam
like
a
valley
of
dream
still
mocks
you
a
land
of
beyond
thank
god
there
is
always
a
land
of
beyond
for
us
who
are
true
to
the
trail
a
vision
to
seek
a
beckoning
peak
a
farness
that
never
will
fail
a
pride
in
our
soul
that
mocks
at
a
goal
a
manhood
that
irks
at
a
bond
and
try
how
we
will
unattainable
still
behold
it
our
land
of
beyond
sunshine
i
flat
as
a
stretch
the
haggard
snows
the
mighty
skies
are
palisades
of
light
the
stars
are
blurred
the
silence
grows
and
grows
vaster
and
vaster
vaults
the
icy
night
here
in
my
i
cower
and
pray
silence
and
night
have
pity
stoop
and
slay
i
have
not
slept
for
many
many
days
i
close
my
eyes
with
weariness
that
all
i
still
have
strength
to
feed
the
blaze
that
flickers
weirdly
on
the
icy
wall
i
still
have
strength
to
pray
god
rest
her
soul
here
in
the
awful
shadow
of
the
pole
there
in
the
cabin
alcove
low
she
lies
still
candles
gleaming
at
her
head
and
feet
all
white
with
closed
eyes
lips
smiling
hands
at
rest
o
god
how
sweet
how
all
unutterably
sweet
she
not
dead
not
dead
indeed
she
dreams
she
dreams
ii
sunshine
i
called
her
and
she
brought
i
vow
god
blessed
sunshine
to
this
life
of
mine
i
was
a
rover
of
the
breed
who
plough
life
furrow
in
a
lonely
line
the
wilderness
my
home
my
fortune
cast
in
a
wild
land
of
dearth
barbaric
vast
when
did
i
see
her
first
long
had
i
lain
groping
my
way
to
life
through
fevered
gloom
sudden
the
cloud
of
darkness
left
my
brain
a
velvet
bar
of
sunshine
pierced
the
room
and
in
that
mellow
glory
aureoled
she
stood
she
stood
all
golden
in
its
gold
sunshine
o
miracle
the
earth
grew
glad
radiant
each
blade
of
grass
each
living
thing
what
a
huge
strength
high
hope
proud
will
i
had
all
the
wide
world
with
rapture
seemed
to
ring
would
she
but
wed
me
then
fared
we
forth
into
the
vast
unvintageable
north

sky
how
sweet
in
slim
canoe
to
glide
and
dream
and
let
the
world
go
by
build
gay
on
greening
strand
in
muskrat
land
in
muskrat
iv
and
so
we
dreamed
and
drifted
she
and
i
and
how
she
loved
that
free
unfathomed
life
there
in
the
of
the
midnight
sky
the
silence
welded
us
true
man
and
wife
then
north
and
north
invincibly
we
pressed
beyond
the
circle
to
the
world
white
crest
and
on
the
arctic
waste
we
stayed
dwelt
with
the
huskies
by
the
polar
sea
fur
had
they
white
fox
marten
mink
to
trade
and
we
had
bacon
flour
and
tea
so
we
made
snug
chummed
up
with
all
the
band
sudden
the
winter
swooped
on
husky
land
v
what
was
that
ill
so
sinister
and
dread
smiting
the
tribe
with
sickness
to
the
bone
so
that
we
waked
one
morn
to
find
them
fled
so
that
we
stood
and
stared
alone
alone
bravely
she
smiled
and
looked
into
my
eyes
laughed
at
their
troubled
stern
foreboding
pain
gaily
she
mocked
the
menace
of
the
skies
turned
to
our
cheery
cabin
once
again
saying
soon
be
over
dearest
one
the
long
long
night
then
o
the
sun
the
sun
vi
made
a
heart
of
gold
of
gold
shining
and
sweet
and
true
gave
it
a
home
of
fairest
mould
blest
it
and
called
it
gave
the
rose
its
grace
of
glow
and
the
lark
its
radiant
glee
but
better
than
all
i
know
i
know
god
gave
you
heart
to
vii
she
was
all
sunshine
in
those
dubious
days
our
cabin
beaconed
with
defiant
light
we
chattered
by
the
friendly
blaze
closer
and
closer
cowered
the
night
a
would
have
been
a
welcome
sound
and
there
was
none
in
all
that
stricken
land
yet
with
such
silence
darkness
death
around
learned
we
to
love
as
few
can
understand
spirit
with
spirit
fused
and
soul
with
soul
there
in
the
sullen
shadow
of
the
pole
viii
what
was
that
haunting
horror
of
the
night
brave
was
she
buoyant
full
of
sunny
cheer
why
was
her
face
so
small
so
strangely
white
then
did
i
turn
from
her
with
fear
sought
in
my
agony
the
outcast
snows
prayed
in
my
pain
to
that
insensate
sky
grovelled
and
sobbed
and
cursed
and
then
arose
sunshine
o
heart
of
gold
to
die
to
die
ix
she
died
on
christmas
day
it
seems
so
sad
that
one
you
love
should
die
on
christmas
day
i
knelt
by
her
o
god
i
had
no
tears
to
shed
no
moan
no
prayer
to
pray
i
heard
her
whisper
call
me
will
you
dear
they
say
death
parts
but
i
wo
go
away
i
will
be
with
you
in
the
cabin
here
oh
i
will
plead
with
god
to
let
me
stay
stay
till
the
night
is
gone
till
spring
is
nigh
till
sunshine
comes
be
brave
i
tired
x
for
weeks
for
months
i
have
not
seen
the
sun
the
minatory
dawns
are
leprous
pale
the
felon
days
malinger
one
by
one
how
like
a
dream
life
is
how
vain
how
stale
i
too
am
faint
that
disease
has
fallen
on
me
weak
and
cold
am
i
hugging
a
tiny
fire
in
fear
i
freeze
the
cabin
must
be
cold
and
so
i
try
to
bear
the
frost
the
frost
that
fights
decay
the
frost
that
keeps
her
beautiful
alway
xi
lies
within
an
icy
vault
it
glitters
like
a
cave
of
salt
all
and
with
candles
at
her
head
and
feet
under
an
ermine
robe
she
lies
i
kiss
her
hands
i
kiss
her
eyes
come
back
come
back
o
love
i
pray
into
this
house
this
house
of
clay
answer
my
kisses
soft
and
warm
nestle
again
within
my
arm
come
for
i
know
that
you
are
near
open
your
eyes
and
look
my
dear
just
for
a
moment
break
the
mesh
back
from
the
spirit
leap
to
flesh
weary
i
wait
the
night
is
black
love
of
my
life
come
back
come
back
xii
last
night
maybe
i
was
a
little
mad
for
as
i
prayed
despairful
by
her
side
such
a
strange
antic
visioning
i
had
lo
it
did
seem
eyes
were
open
surely
i
must
have
dreamed
i
stared
once
no
was
a
candle
trick
a
shadow
cast
there
were
her
lashes
locking
as
before
oh
but
it
filled
me
with
a
joy
so
vast
no
was
a
freak
a
fancy
of
the
brain
oh
but
i
try
again
again
xiii
it
was
no
dream
now
do
i
know
that
love
leapt
from
the
starry
battlements
of
death
for
in
my
vigil
as
i
bent
above
calling
her
name
with
eager
burning
breath
sudden
there
came
a
change
again
i
saw
the
radiance
of
the
stain
her
cheek
rivers
of
rapture
thrilled
in
sunny
thaw
cleft
were
her
coral
lips
as
if
to
speak
curved
were
her
tender
arms
as
if
to
cling
open
the
eyes
of
lucent
blue
looking
at
me
with
love
so
pitying
that
i
could
fancy
heaven
shining
through
sunshine
i
faltered
stay
with
me
oh
stay
yet
ere
i
finished
in
a
moment
flight
there
in
her
angel
purity
she
lay
ah
but
i
know
she
come
again
as
radiant
sword
leaps
from
the
sheath
soul
from
the
body
leaps
we
call
it
xiv
even
as
this
line
i
write
do
i
know
that
she
is
near
happy
am
i
every
night
comes
she
back
to
bid
me
cheer
kissing
her
i
hold
her
fast
win
her
into
life
at
last
did
i
dream
that
yesterday
on
yon
mountain
ridge
a
glow
soft
as
moonstone
paled
away
leaving
less
forlorn
the
snow
could
it
be
the
sun
oh
fain
would
i
see
the
sun
again
oh
to
see
a
coral
dawn
gladden
to
a
crocus
glow
day
a
spectre
dim
and
wan
dancing
on
the
furtive
snow
night
a
cloud
upon
my
brain
oh
to
see
the
sun
again
you
who
find
us
in
this
place
have
you
pity
in
your
breast
let
us
in
our
last
embrace
under
earth
rest
night
a
claw
upon
my
brain
oh
to
see
the
sun
again
xv
the
sun
at
last
the
sun
i
write
these
lines
here
on
my
knees
with
feeble
fumbling
hand
look
in
yon
mountain
cleft
a
radiance
shines
gleam
of
a
primrose
see
it
thrill
expand
grow
glorious
dear
god
be
praised
it
streams
into
the
cabin
in
a
gush
of
gold
look
there
she
stands
the
angel
of
my
dreams
all
in
the
radiant
shimmer
aureoled
first
as
i
saw
her
from
my
bed
of
pain
first
as
i
loved
her
when
the
darkness
passed
now
do
i
know
that
life
is
not
in
vain
now
do
i
know
god
cares
at
last
at
last
light
outlives
dark
joy
grief
and
love
the
sum
heart
of
my
heart
sunshine
i
come
i
the
idealist
oh
you
who
have
daring
deeds
to
tell
and
you
who
have
felt
ambition
spell
have
you
heard
of
the
louse
who
longed
to
dwell
in
the
golden
hair
of
a
queen
he
sighed
all
day
and
he
sighed
all
night
and
no
one
could
understand
it
quite
for
the
head
of
a
slut
is
a
louse
delight
but
he
pined
for
the
head
of
a
queen
so
he
left
his
kinsfolk
in
merry
play
and
off
by
his
lonesome
he
stole
away
from
the
home
of
his
youth
so
bright
and
gay
and
gloriously
unclean
and
at
last
he
came
to
the
palace
gate
and
he
made
his
way
in
a
manner
straight
for
a
louse
may
go
where
a
man
must
wait
to
the
of
the
queen
the
queen
she
spake
to
her
there
something
the
matter
i
afraid
ere
for
sleep
my
hair
ye
braid
just
see
what
may
be
seen
and
lo
when
they
combed
that
shining
hair
they
found
him
alone
in
his
glory
there
and
he
cried
i
die
but
i
do
not
care
for
i
lived
in
the
head
of
a
queen
athabaska
dick
when
the
boys
come
out
from
lac
labiche
in
the
lure
of
the
early
spring
to
take
the
pay
of
the
hudson
bay
as
their
fathers
did
before
they
are
all
for
the
jamboree
and
they
make
the
landing
ring
with
a
whoop
and
a
whirl
and
a
grab
your
girl
and
a
rip
and
a
skip
and
a
roar
for
the
spree
of
spring
is
a
sacred
thing
and
the
boys
must
have
their
fun
packer
and
tracker
and
cree
from
the
boat
to
the
bar
they
leap
and
then
when
the
long
flotilla
goes
and
the
last
of
their
pay
is
done
the
boys
from
the
banks
of
lac
labiche
swing
to
the
heavy
sweep
and
oh
how
they
sigh
and
their
throats
are
dry
and
sorry
are
they
and
sick
yet
there
none
so
cursed
with
a
thirst
as
that
athabaska
dick
he
was
long
and
slim
and
lean
of
limb
but
strong
as
a
stripling
bear
and
by
the
right
of
his
skill
and
might
he
guided
the
long
brigade
all
were
his
laughing
eyes
and
he
steered
with
a
careless
care
and
he
shunned
the
shock
of
foam
and
rock
till
they
came
to
the
big
cascade
and
here
they
must
make
the
long
portage
and
the
boys
sweat
in
the
sun
and
they
heft
and
pack
and
they
haul
and
track
and
each
must
do
his
trick
but
their
thoughts
are
far
in
the
landing
bar
where
the
founts
of
nectar
run
and
no
man
thinks
of
such
gorgeous
drinks
as
that
athabaska
dick
was
the
close
of
day
and
his
long
boat
lay
just
over
the
big
cascade
when
there
came
to
him
one
jim
with
a
wild
light
in
his
eye
and
he
softly
laughed
and
he
led
dick
aft
all
eager
yet
half
afraid
and
snugly
stowed
in
his
coat
he
showed
a
pilfered
flask
of
rye
and
in
haste
he
slipped
or
in
fear
he
tripped
but
dick
in
warning
roared
and
there
rang
a
yell
and
it
befell
that
jim
was
overboard
oh
i
heard
a
splash
and
quick
as
a
flash
i
knew
he
could
not
swim
i
saw
him
whirl
in
the
river
swirl
and
thresh
his
arms
about
in
a
queer
strained
way
i
heard
dick
say
i
going
after
him
throw
off
his
coat
leap
down
the
boat
and
then
i
gave
a
shout
boys
grab
him
quick
you
crazy
dick
far
better
one
than
two
hell
man
you
know
you
got
no
show
it
sure
and
certain
and
there
we
hung
and
there
we
clung
with
beef
and
brawn
and
thew
and
sinews
cracked
and
joints
were
racked
and
panting
came
our
breath
and
there
we
swayed
and
there
we
prayed
till
strength
and
hope
were
spent
then
dick
he
threw
us
off
like
rats
and
after
jim
he
went
with
mighty
urge
amid
the
surge
of
he
leapt
and
gripped
his
mate
and
desperate
he
fought
to
gain
the
shore
with
teeth
he
bucked
the
stream
yet
swift
and
sure
he
swept
to
meet
the
mighty
cataract
that
waited
all
and
there
we
stood
like
carven
wood
our
faces
sickly
white
and
watched
him
as
he
beat
the
foam
and
inch
by
inch
he
lost
and
nearer
nearer
drew
the
fall
and
fiercer
grew
the
fight
till
on
the
very
cascade
crest
a
last
farewell
he
tossed
then
down
and
down
and
down
they
plunged
into
that
pit
of
dread
and
mad
we
tore
along
the
shore
to
claim
our
bitter
dead
and
from
that
hell
of
frenzied
foam
that
crashed
and
fumed
and
boiled
two
little
bodies
bubbled
up
and
they
were
heedless
then
and
oh
they
lay
like
senseless
clay
and
bitter
hard
we
toiled
yet
never
never
gleam
of
hope
and
we
were
weary
men
and
moments
mounted
into
hours
and
black
was
our
despair
and
faint
were
we
and
we
were
fain
to
give
them
up
as
dead
when
suddenly
i
thrilled
with
hope
back
boys
and
give
him
air
i
feel
the
flutter
of
his
and
as
the
word
i
said
dick
gave
a
sigh
and
gazed
around
and
saw
our
breathless
band
and
saw
the
sky
blue
floor
above
all
strewn
with
golden
fleece
and
saw
his
comrade
jim
and
touched
him
with
his
hand
and
then
there
came
into
his
eyes
a
look
of
perfect
peace
and
as
there
at
his
very
feet
the
thwarted
river
raved
i
heard
him
murmur
low
and
deep
thank
god
the
saved
cheer
it
a
mighty
good
world
so
it
is
dear
lass
when
even
the
worst
is
said
there
a
smile
and
a
tear
a
sigh
and
a
cheer
but
better
be
living
than
dead
a
joy
and
a
pain
a
loss
and
a
gain
there
honey
and
may
be
some
gall
yet
still
i
declare
foul
weather
or
fair
it
a
mighty
good
world
after
all
for
look
lass
at
night
when
i
break
from
the
fight
my
kingdom
awaiting
for
me
there
comfort
and
rest
and
the
warmth
of
your
breast
and
little
ones
climbing
my
knee
there
and
song
oh
the
world
may
be
wrong
its
empires
may
topple
and
fall
my
home
is
my
care
if
gladness
be
there
it
a
mighty
good
world
after
all
o
heart
of
pure
gold
i
have
made
you
a
fold
it
sheltered
and
warm
o
little
ones
rest
i
have
fashioned
a
nest
sleep
on
you
are
safe
from
the
storm
for
there
no
foe
like
fear
and
there
no
friend
like
cheer
and
sunshine
will
flash
at
our
call
so
crown
love
as
king
and
let
us
all
sing
it
a
mighty
good
world
after
all
the
return
they
turned
him
loose
he
bowed
his
head
a
felon
bent
and
grey
his
face
was
even
as
the
dead
he
had
no
word
to
say
he
sought
the
home
of
his
old
love
to
look
on
her
once
more
and
where
her
roses
breathed
above
he
cowered
beside
the
door
she
sat
there
in
the
shining
room
her
hair
was
silver
grey
he
stared
and
stared
from
out
the
gloom
he
turned
to
go
away
her
roses
rustled
overhead
she
saw
with
sudden
start
i
knew
that
you
would
come
she
said
and
held
him
to
her
heart
her
face
was
rapt
and
she
touched
his
hair
of
grey
he
at
her
feet
could
only
pray
and
the
junior
god
the
junior
god
looked
from
his
place
in
the
conning
towers
of
heaven
and
he
saw
the
world
through
the
span
of
space
like
a
giant
driven
and
because
he
was
bored
as
some
gods
are
with
high
celestial
mirth
he
clutched
the
reins
of
a
shooting
star
and
he
steered
it
down
to
earth
the
junior
god
leaf
and
bud
passed
on
with
a
weary
air
till
lo
he
came
to
a
pool
of
mud
and
some
hogs
were
rolling
there
then
in
he
plunged
with
gleeful
cries
and
down
he
lay
supine
for
they
had
no
mud
in
paradise
and
they
likewise
had
no
swine
the
junior
god
forgot
himself
he
squelched
mud
through
his
toes
with
the
careless
joy
of
a
wanton
boy
his
reckless
laughter
rose
till
tired
at
last
in
a
brook
close
by
he
washed
off
every
stain
then
softly
up
to
the
radiant
sky
he
rose
a
god
again
the
junior
god
now
heads
the
roll
in
the
list
of
heaven
peers
he
sits
in
the
house
of
high
control
and
he
regulates
the
spheres
yet
does
he
wonder
do
you
suppose
if
even
in
gods
divine
the
best
and
wisest
may
not
be
those
who
have
wallowed
awhile
with
the
swine
the
nostomaniac
the
ragged
edge
of
the
world
i
roam
and
the
home
of
the
wolf
shall
be
my
home
and
a
bunch
of
bones
on
the
boundless
snows
the
end
of
my
trail
who
knows
who
knows
i
dreaming
in
the
alone
in
my
study
tower
my
books
battalioned
around
me
my
kipling
flat
on
my
knee
but
i
not
in
the
mood
for
reading
i
have
moved
for
an
hour
body
and
brain
i
weary
weary
the
heart
of
me
weary
of
crushing
a
longing
it
little
i
understand
for
i
thought
that
my
trail
was
ended
i
thought
i
had
earned
my
rest
but
oh
it
stronger
than
life
is
the
call
of
the
hearthless
land
and
i
turn
to
the
north
in
my
trouble
as
a
child
to
the
here
in
my
den
it
quiet
the
taps
on
the
pane
there
comfort
and
ease
and
plenty
the
smile
of
the
south
is
sweet
all
that
a
man
might
long
for
fight
for
and
seek
in
vain
pictures
and
books
and
music
pleasure
my
last
retreat
peace
i
thought
i
had
gained
it
i
swore
that
my
tale
was
told
by
my
hair
that
is
grey
i
swore
it
by
my
eyes
that
are
slow
to
see
yet
what
does
it
all
avail
me
as
of
old
out
of
the
dark
i
hear
it
the
northland
calling
to
me
and
i
daring
a
rampageous
river
that
runs
the
devil
knows
where
my
hand
is
athrill
on
the
paddle
the
bounds
like
a
bird
hark
to
the
rumble
of
rapids
here
in
my
morris
chair
eager
and
tense
i
straining
is
it
most
absurd
now
in
the
churn
and
the
lather
foam
that
hisses
and
stings
leap
i
keyed
for
the
struggle
fury
and
fume
and
roar
rocks
are
spitting
like
oh
it
a
sport
for
kings
life
on
a
twist
of
the
paddle
there
my
kim
on
the
floor
how
i
thrill
and
i
vision
then
my
camp
of
a
night
red
and
gold
of
the
net
afloat
in
the
stream
scent
of
the
pines
and
silence
little
pal
pipe
alight
body
with
pleasure
sleep
untroubled
of
dream
banquet
of
paystreak
bacon
moment
of
joy
divine
when
the
bannock
is
hot
and
gluey
and
the
teapot
nearing
the
boil
never
was
wolf
so
hungry
stomach
cleaving
to
ha
there
my
servant
calling
says
that
dinner
will
spoil
what
do
i
want
with
dinner
can
i
eat
any
more
can
i
sleep
as
i
used
to
oh
i
abhor
this
life
give
me
the
great
uncertain
the
barren
land
for
a
floor
the
milky
way
for
a
splendour
and
space
and
strife
something
to
fight
and
die
for
the
limpid
lake
of
the
bear
the
empire
of
empty
bellies
the
dunes
where
the
dogribs
dwell
big
things
real
things
live
things
here
on
my
morris
chair
how
i
ache
for
the
northland
dinner
and
servants

i
too
old
i
wonder

take
one
trip
more

to
the
valleys
flooded
with
sunset

peaks
that
pierce
the
aurora
rivers

must
explore
lakes
of
a
thousand
islands
millioning
hordes
of
the
pine

ambition
they
brought
the
mighty
chief
to
town
they
showed
him
strange
unwonted
sights
yet
as
he
wandered
up
and
down
he
seemed
to
scorn
their
vain
delights
his
face
was
grim
his
eye
lacked
fire
as
one
who
mourns
a
glory
dead
and
when
they
sought
his
heart
desire
me
tooth
same
gold
he
said
a
dental
place
they
quickly
found
he
neither
moaned
nor
moved
his
head
they
pulled
his
teeth
so
white
and
sound
they
put
in
teeth
of
gold
instead
oh
never
saw
i
man
so
gay
his
very
being
seemed
to
swell
ha
ha
he
cried
now
injun
say
me
heap
big
chief
look
like
to
sunnydale
there
lies
the
trail
to
sunnydale
amid
the
lure
of
laughter
oh
how
can
we
unhappy
be
beneath
its
leafy
rafter
each
perfect
hour
is
like
a
flower
each
day
is
like
a
posy
how
can
you
say
the
skies
are
grey
you
wrong
my
friend
they
rosy
with
right
good
will
let
climb
the
hill
and
leave
behind
all
sorrow
oh
we
be
gay
a
bright
will
make
a
bright
oh
we
be
strong
the
way
is
long
that
never
has
a
turning
the
hill
is
high
but
there
the
sky
and
how
the
west
is
burning
and
if
through
chance
of
circumstance
we
have
to
go
sir
we
not
repine
a
friend
of
mine
has
got
no
feet
to
boot
sir
this
happiness
a
habit
is
and
life
is
what
we
make
it
see
there
the
trail
to
sunnydale
up
friend
and
let
us
take
it
the
blind
and
the
dead
she
lay
like
a
saint
on
her
copper
couch
like
an
angel
asleep
she
lay
in
the
stare
of
the
ghoulish
folks
that
slouch
past
the
dead
and
sneak
away
then
came
old
jules
of
the
sightless
gaze
who
begged
in
the
streets
for
bread
each
day
he
had
come
for
a
year
of
days
and
groped
his
way
to
the
dead
what
the
devil
harvest
he
cried
a
wanton
with
eyes
of
blue
i
known
too
many
a
such
he
sighed
maybe
i
know
this
mon
dieu
he
raised
the
head
of
the
heedless
dead
he
fingered
the
frozen
then
a
deathly
spell
on
the
watchers
fell
god
it
was
still
that
place
he
raised
the
head
of
the
careless
dead
he
fumbled
a
vagrant
curl
and
then
with
his
sightless
smile
he
said
it
only
my
little
girl
dear
my
dear
did
they
hurt
you
so
come
to
your
daddy
aye
and
he
held
so
tight
you
know
they
were
hard
to
force
apart
no
paris
is
always
gay
and
the
morgue
has
its
stories
too
you
are
a
writer
of
tales
you
say
then
there
is
a
tale
for
you
the
atavist
what
are
you
doing
here
tom
thorne
on
the
white
o
the
world
where
the
wind
has
the
cut
of
a
naked
knife
and
the
stars
are
rapier
keen
hugging
a
smudgy
willow
fire
deep
in
a
lynx
robe
curled
you
that
a
lord
own
son
tom
thorne
what
does
your
madness
mean
go
home
go
home
to
your
clubs
tom
thorne
home
to
your
evening
dress
home
to
your
place
of
power
and
pride
and
the
feast
that
waits
for
you
why
do
you
linger
all
alone
in
the
splendid
emptiness
scouring
the
land
of
the
little
sticks
on
the
trail
of
the
caribou
why
did
you
fall
off
the
earth
tom
thorne
out
of
our
social
ken
what
did
your
deep
damnation
prove
what
was
your
dark
despair
oh
with
the
width
of
a
world
between
and
years
to
the
count
of
ten
if
they
cut
out
your
heart
tom
thorne
name
would
be
graven
there
and
you
fled
afar
for
the
thing
called
peace
and
you
thought
you
would
find
it
here
in
the
purple
tundras
vastly
spread
and
the
mountains
whitely
piled
it
a
weary
quest
and
a
dreary
quest
but
i
think
that
the
end
is
near
for
they
say
that
the
lord
has
hidden
it
in
the
secret
heart
of
the
wild
and
you
know
that
heart
as
few
men
know
and
your
eyes
are
fey
and
deep
with
a
something
lost
come
welling
back
from
the
raw
red
dawn
of
life
with
woe
and
pain
have
you
greatly
lain
till
out
of
abysmal
sleep
the
soul
of
the
stone
age
leaps
in
you
alert
for
the
ancient
strife
and
if
you
came
to
our
feast
again
with
its
pomp
and
glee
and
glow
i
think
you
would
sit
tom
thorne
and
see
in
a
daze
of
dream
a
mad
sun
goading
to
frenzied
flame
the
glittering
gems
of
the
snow
and
a
monster
bulking
black
against
the
gleam
i
think
you
would
see
shores
and
stammer
and
halt
and
stare
with
a
sudden
sense
of
the
frozen
void
serene
and
vast
and
still
and
the
aching
gleam
and
the
hush
of
dream
and
the
track
of
a
great
white
bear
and
the
primal
lust
that
surged
in
you
as
you
sprang
to
make
your
kill
i
think
you
would
hear
the
call
and
the
glutted
river
roar
and
spy
the
hosts
of
the
caribou
shadow
the
shining
plain
and
feel
the
pulse
of
the
silences
and
stand
elate
once
more
on
the
verge
of
the
yawning
vastitudes
that
call
to
you
in
vain
for
i
think
you
are
one
with
the
stars
and
the
sun
and
the
wind
and
the
wave
and
the
dew
and
the
peaks
untrod
that
yearn
to
god
and
the
valleys
undefiled
men
soar
with
wings
and
they
bridle
kings
but
what
is
it
all
to
you
wise
in
the
ways
of
the
wilderness
and
strong
with
the
strength
of
the
wild
you
have
spent
your
life
you
have
waged
your
strife
where
never
we
play
a
part
you
have
held
the
throne
of
the
great
unknown
you
have
ruled
a
kingdom
vast
there
a
strange
new
trail
for
you
and
you
go
o
weary
heart
to
the
peace
and
rest
of
the
great
unguessed
at
last
tom
thorne
at
the
sceptic
my
father
christmas
passed
away
when
i
was
barely
seven
at
i
lost
my
hope
of
heaven
yet
not
in
either
lies
the
curse
the
hell
of
it
because
i
do
know
which
loss
hurt
the
worse
my
god
or
santa
claus
the
rover
i
oh
how
good
it
is
to
be
and
just
my
dog
and
pipe
and
i
underneath
the
vast
sky
trail
to
try
and
goal
to
win
white
road
and
cool
inn
fields
to
lure
a
lad
afar
clear
spring
and
still
star
lilting
feet
that
never
tire
green
dingle
fagot
fire
none
to
hurry
none
to
hold
heather
hill
and
hushed
fold
nature
like
a
picture
book
laughing
leaf
and
bright
brook
every
day
a
jewel
bright
set
serenely
in
the
night
every
night
a
holy
shrine
radiant
for
a
day
divine
weathered
cheek
and
kindly
eye
let
the
wanderer
go
by
and
wistful
heart
let
the
gipsy
one
depart
for
the
farness
and
the
road
are
his
glory
and
his
goad
oh
the
lilt
of
youth
and
spring
eyes
laugh
and
lips
sing
yea
but
it
is
good
to
be
and
ii
yet
how
good
it
is
to
come
home
at
last
home
home
on
the
clover
swings
the
bee
overhead
the
hale
tree
sky
of
turquoise
gleams
through
yonder
glints
the
lake
blue
in
a
hammock
let
swing
weary
of
wandering
tired
of
wild
uncertain
lands
strange
faces
faint
hands
has
the
wondrous
world
gone
cold
am
i
growing
old
old
grey
and
weary
let
me
dream
glide
on
the
tranquil
stream
oh
what
joyous
days
i
had
full
fervid
gay
glad
yet
there
comes
a
subtile
change
let
the
stripling
rove
range
from
sweet
roving
comes
sweet
rest
after
all
home
best
and
if
there
a
little
bit
of
with
it
i
will
count
my
life
content
and
well
but
it
is
good
to
be
and
yet
how
good
it
is
to
come
home
at
last
home
home
bill
at
dawn
of
day
the
white
land
lay
all
and
grim
when
bill
he
says
to
me
we
to
do
it
jim
we
got
to
make
fort
liard
quick
i
know
the
river
bad
but
oh
the
little
woman
sick
why
do
you
savvy
lad
and
me
well
yes
i
must
confess
it
was
hard
to
see
their
little
family
group
of
two
would
soon
be
one
of
three
and
so
i
answered
why
bill
you
do
suppose
i
scared
of
that
there
brook
whatever
you
say
goes
a
real
live
man
was
bill
with
insides
for
was
the
brand
of
hooch
to
which
he
most
inclined
they
knew
him
far
his
igloos
are
on
kittiegazuit
strand
they
knew
him
well
the
tribes
who
dwell
within
the
barren
land
from
koyokuk
to
kuskoquim
his
fame
was
everywhere
and
he
did
love
all
life
above
that
little
julie
claire
the
lithe
white
he
had
bought
for
seven
hundred
skins
and
taken
to
his
wickiup
to
make
his
moccasins
we
crawled
down
to
the
river
bank
and
feeble
folk
were
we
that
julie
claire
from
and
bill
and
me
from
shore
to
shore
we
heard
the
roar
the
heaving
make
and
loud
we
laughed
and
launched
our
raft
and
followed
in
their
wake
the
river
swept
and
seethed
and
leapt
and
caught
us
in
its
stride
and
on
we
hurled
amid
a
world
that
crashed
on
every
side
with
sullen
din
the
banks
caved
in
the
lanced
the
stream
the
naked
floes
like
spooks
arose
all
jiggling
and
agleam
black
of
strange
device
shot
upward
from
its
bed
as
night
and
day
we
cleft
our
way
and
we
sped
but
faster
still
cried
bill
and
looked
the
day
in
dull
despair
at
julie
claire
as
white
like
death
she
lay
and
sometimes
he
would
seem
to
pray
and
sometimes
seem
to
curse
and
bent
above
with
eyes
of
love
yet
ever
she
grew
worse
and
as
we
plunged
and
leapt
and
lunged
her
face
was
plucked
with
pain
and
i
could
feel
his
nerves
of
steel
at
the
strain
and
in
the
night
he
gripped
me
tight
as
i
lay
fast
asleep
the
river
kicking
like
a
steer
run
out
the
forward
sweep
that
canyon
right
ahead
i
know
of
old
its
roar
and
i
be
damned
ice
is
jammed
we
to
make
the
shore
with
one
wild
leap
i
gripped
the
sweep
the
night
was
black
as
sin
the
crashed
and
ripped
and
smashed
and
stunned
us
with
its
din
and
near
and
near
and
clear
and
clear
i
heard
the
canyon
boom
and
swift
and
strong
we
swept
along
to
meet
our
awful
doom
and
as
with
dread
i
glimpsed
ahead
the
death
that
waited
there
my
only
thought
was
of
the
girl
the
little
julie
claire
and
so
like
demon
mad
with
fear
i
panted
at
the
oar
and
foot
by
foot
and
inch
by
inch
we
worked
the
raft
ashore
the
bank
was
staked
with
grinding
ice
and
as
we
scraped
and
crashed
i
only
knew
one
thing
to
do
and
through
my
mind
it
flashed
yet
while
i
groped
to
find
the
rope
i
heard
bill
savage
cry
that
my
job
lad
it
me
that
jumps
i
snub
this
raft
or
die
i
saw
him
leap
i
saw
him
creep
i
saw
him
gain
the
land
i
saw
him
crawl
i
saw
him
fall
then
run
with
rope
in
hand
and
then
the
darkness
gulped
him
up
and
down
we
dashed
once
more
and
nearer
nearer
drew
the
jam
and
its
roar
oh
god
all
lost
from
julie
claire
there
came
a
wail
of
pain
and
then
the
rope
grew
sudden
taut
and
quivered
at
the
strain
it
slacked
and
slipped
it
whined
and
gripped
and
oh
i
held
my
breath
and
there
we
hung
and
there
we
swung
right
in
the
jaws
of
death
a
little
strand
of
hempen
rope
and
how
i
watched
it
there
with
all
around
a
hell
of
sound
and
darkness
and
despair
a
little
strand
of
hempen
rope
i
watched
it
all
alone
and
somewhere
in
the
dark
behind
i
heard
a
woman
moan
and
somewhere
in
the
dark
ahead
i
heard
a
man
cry
out
then
silence
silence
silence
fell
and
mocked
my
hollow
shout
and
yet
once
more
from
out
the
shore
i
heard
that
cry
of
pain
a
moan
of
mortal
agony
then
all
was
still
again
that
night
was
hell
with
all
the
frills
and
when
the
dawn
broke
dim
i
saw
a
lean
and
level
land
but
never
sign
of
him
i
saw
a
flat
and
frozen
shore
of
hideous
device
i
saw
a
strand
of
rope
that
vanished
through
the
ice
and
on
that
treeless
rockless
shore
i
found
my
partner
dead
no
place
was
there
to
snub
the
raft
so
had
served
and
with
the
rope
lashed
round
his
waist
in
last
defiant
fight
he
thrown
himself
beneath
the
ice
that
closed
and
gripped
him
tight
and
there
he
held
us
back
from
death
as
fast
in
death
he
say
boys
i
not
the
pious
brand
but
i
just
tried
to
pray
and
then
i
looked
to
julie
claire
and
sore
abashed
was
i
for
from
the
robes
that
covered
her
heard
a
baby
thus
was
love
conqueror
of
death
and
life
for
life
was
given
and
though
no
saint
on
earth
d
think
bill
squared
hisself
with
heaven
if
you
had
the
choice
of
two
women
to
wed
though
of
course
the
idea
is
quite
absurd
and
the
first
from
her
heels
to
her
dainty
head
was
charming
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
yet
in
the
past
i
grieve
to
state
she
never
had
been
exactly
straight
and
the
second
she
was
beyond
all
cavil
a
model
of
virtue
i
must
confess
and
yet
alas
she
was
dull
as
the
devil
and
rather
a
dowd
in
the
way
of
dress
though
what
she
was
lacking
in
wit
and
beauty
she
more
than
made
up
for
in
sense
of
duty
now
suppose
you
must
wed
and
make
no
blunder
and
either
would
love
you
and
let
you
win
her
which
of
the
two
would
you
choose
i
wonder
the
stolid
saint
or
the
sparkling
sinner
just
think
just
think
some
night
the
stars
will
gleam
upon
a
cold
grey
stone
and
trace
a
name
with
silver
beam
and
lo
be
your
own
that
night
is
speeding
on
to
greet
your
epitaphic
rhyme
your
life
is
but
a
little
beat
within
the
heart
of
time
a
little
gain
a
little
pain
a
laugh
lest
you
may
moan
a
little
blame
a
little
fame
a
on
a
stone
the
lunger
jack
would
laugh
an
joke
all
day
never
saw
a
lad
so
gay
singin
like
a
medder
lark
loaded
to
the
plimsoll
mark
with
god
sunshine
was
that
boy
had
a
on
joy
held
his
head
up
in
air
left
no
callin
cards
on
care
breezy
buoyant
brave
and
true
sent
his
sunshine
out
to
you
cheerfulest
when
clouds
was
black
happy
jack
oh
happy
jack
sittin
in
my
shack
alone
i
could
hear
him
in
his
own
singin
far
into
the
night
till
it
did
seem
just
right
one
man
should
corral
the
fun
live
his
life
so
in
the
sun
did
seem
quite
natural
not
to
have
a
grouch
at
all
not
a
trouble
not
a
lack
happy
jack
oh
happy
jack
he
was
plumbful
of
good
cheer
till
he
struck
that
year
got
so
thin
so
little
to
him
you
could
most
see
through
him
never
was
his
eye
so
bright
never
was
his
cheek
so
white
seemed
as
if
somethin
was
wrong
sort
o
quaver
in
his
song
same
old
smile
same
hearty
voice
bless
you
boys
let
all
rejoice
but
old
doctor
shook
his
head
half
a
lung
was
all
he
said
yet
that
half
was
surely
right
for
i
heard
him
every
night
singin
singin
in
his
shack
happy
jack
oh
happy
jack
then
one
day
a
letter
came
endin
with
a
female
name
seemed
to
get
him
in
the
neck
sort
o
effect
paled
his
lip
and
plucked
his
breath
left
him
starin
still
as
death
somethin
had
gone
awful
wrong
yet
that
night
he
sang
his
song
oh
but
it
was
good
to
hear
for
there
clutched
my
heart
a
fear
so
that
i
quaked
every
night
to
hear
him
sing
but
each
day
he
laughed
with
me
an
his
smile
was
full
of
glee
nothin
seemed
to
set
him
back
happy
jack
oh
happy
jack
then
one
night
the
singin
stopped
seemed
as
if
my
heart
just
flopped
for
i
learned
to
love
the
boy
with
his
line
of
joy
with
his
glorious
gift
of
bluff
with
his
splendid
fightin
stuff
sing
on
lad
and
play
the
game
o
dear
god
no
singin
came
but
there
surged
to
me
instead
silence
silence
deep
and
dread
till
i
shuddered
tried
to
pray
said
he
maybe
gone
away
oh
yes
he
had
gone
away
gone
forever
and
a
day
but
he
left
behind
him
there
in
his
cabin
pinched
and
bare
his
poor
body
skin
and
bone
his
sharp
face
cold
as
a
stone
an
his
stiffened
fingers
pressed
somethin
bright
upon
his
breast
locket
with
a
silken
curl
poor
sweet
portrait
of
a
girl
yet
i
reckon
at
the
last
how
he
passed
for
there
sat
upon
his
lips
smile
that
death
could
not
eclipse
an
within
his
eyes
lived
still
joy
that
dyin
could
not
kill
an
now
when
the
nights
are
long
how
i
miss
his
cheery
song
how
i
sigh
an
wish
him
back
happy
jack
oh
happy
jack
the
mountain
and
the
lake
i
know
a
mountain
thrilling
to
the
stars
peerless
and
pure
and
pinnacled
with
snow
glimpsing
the
golden
dawn
coral
bars
flaunting
the
vanisht
sunset
garnet
glow
proudly
patrician
passionless
serene
soaring
in
silvered
steeps
where
break
virgin
and
vestal
oh
a
very
queen
and
at
her
feet
there
dreams
a
quiet
lake
my
lake
adores
my
mountain
well
i
know
for
i
have
watched
it
from
its
start
stilling
its
mirror
to
her
splendid
snow
framing
her
image
in
its
trembling
heart
glassing
her
graciousness
of
greening
wood
kissing
her
throne
melodiously
mad
thrilling
responsive
to
her
every
mood
gloomed
with
her
sadness
gay
when
she
is
glad
my
lake
has
dreamed
and
loved
since
time
was
born
will
love
and
dream
till
time
shall
cease
to
be
gazing
to
her
in
worship
half
forlorn
who
looks
towards
the
stars
and
will
not
see
my
peerless
mountain
splendid
in
her
alas
poor
little
lake
alas
poor
me
the
headliner
and
the
breadliner
moko
the
educated
ape
is
here
the
pet
of
vaudeville
so
the
posters
say
and
every
night
the
gaping
people
pay
to
see
him
in
his
panoply
appear
to
see
him
pad
his
paunch
with
dainty
cheer
puff
his
perfecto
swill
champagne
and
sway
just
like
a
gentleman
yet
all
in
play
then
bow
himself
off
stage
with
brutish
leer
and
as
with
noble
knowledge
crammed
i
this
human
compost
take
my
place
i
once
a
poet
now
so
dead
and
damned
the
woeful
tears
half
freezing
on
my
face
o
god
i
cry
let
me
but
take
his
shape
moko
the
blest
the
educated
ape
death
in
the
arctic
i
i
took
the
clock
down
from
the
shelf
at
eight
said
i
i
shoot
myself
it
lacked
a
of
the
hour
and
as
i
waited
all
a
skinful
of
black
boding
pain
bits
of
my
life
came
back
mother
there
nothing
more
to
eat
why
do
you
go
out
on
the
street
always
you
sit
and
cry
and
cry
here
at
my
play
i
wonder
why
mother
when
you
dress
up
at
night
red
are
your
cheeks
your
eyes
are
bright
twining
a
ribband
in
your
hair
kissing

go
then
i
as
lonely
as
can
be
oh
how
i
wish
you
were
with
me
yet
when
you
go
out
on
the
street
mother
there
always
lots
to
ii
for
days
the
igloo
has
been
dark
but
now
the
rag
wick
sends
a
spark
that
glitters
in
the
icy
air
and
wakes
frost
sapphires
everywhere
bright
bitter
flames
that
dart
here
and
there
yet
fear
to
strike
the
gruesome
gloom
wherein
lie
my
comrades
oh
so
keen
to
die
and
i
the
last
well
here
i
wait
the
clock
to
strike
the
hour
of
boy
it
is
bitter
to
be
hurled
nameless
and
naked
on
the
world
frozen
by
night
and
starved
by
day
curses
and
kicks
and
clouts
your
pay
but
you
must
fight
boy
look
on
me
anarch
of
all
beggar
and
tramp
and
shameless
sot
emblem
of
ill
in
rags
that
rot
would
you
be
foul
and
base
as
i
oh
it
is
better
far
to
die
swear
to
me
now
you
fight
and
fight
boy
or
i
kill
you
here
iii
curse
this
silence
soft
and
black
sting

shadows
back

little
flame
with
freakish
glee

with
brilliant
mockery

of

murk
so
deep
where
in

but
do
not

where
they
lie

who
had
all
the
luck
to
die
there
is
nothing
more
to

us
part
and

i
will
go
across

morn
of
youth

back
at
last

last
crushed
with
knowing
of
the
truth
how
through
bitter
barren
years
you
loved
me
and
me
alone
waited
wearied
wept
your
tears

first
to
go
bitten
his
eyes
were
by
the
snow
sightless
and
sealed
his
eyes
of
blue
so
that
he
died
before
i
knew
here
in
those
poor
weak
arms

died

the
horror

borne
with
pain
so
long
and
hoped
for
help
in
vain
so
frail

and
blind
and
dazed
with
scurvy
sick
with
silence
crazed
beneath
the
arctic
heel
of
hate
avid
for
death

up
months
ago
but
seldom
do
men
suffer
so
his
feet
sloughed
off
his
fingers
died
his
hands
shrunk
up
and
mummified
i
had
to
feed
him
like
a
child
yet
he
was
valiant
joked
and
smiled
talked
of
his
wife
and
little
one
thanks

to
god

i
have
none

night
without
a

the
sound
of
bells
to
hear
often
i
wake
from
sleep
oh
hark
help
it
is
coming
near
and
near
blindly
i
reel
toward
the
door
there
the
snow
billows
bleak
and
bare
blindly
i
seek
my
den
once
more
silence
and
darkness
and
despair
oh
it
is
all
a
dreadful
dream
scurvy
and
cold
and
death
and
dearth
i
will
awake
to
warmth
and
gleam
silvery
seas
and
greening

is
a

gentle
shadow
of

tick
little
clock
my
life
away
even
a
second
seems
a
day
even
a
minute
seems
a
year
peopled
with
ghosts
that
press
and
peer
into
my
face
so
charnel
white
lit
by
the
devilish
dancing
light
tick
little
clock
mete
out
my
fate
tortured
and
tense
i
wait
i

oh
i
have
sworn
the
hour
is
nigh
when
it
strikes
eight
i
die
i
die
raise
up
the
gun
it
stings
my
brow
when
it
strikes
eight
all
ready
down
from
my
hand
the
weapon
dropped
wildly
i
clock
had
ix
phantoms
and
fears
and
ghosts
have
gone
peace
seems
to
nestle
in
my
brain
lo
the
clock
stopped
i
living
on
i
was
and
less
than
sane
yet
do
i
scorn
the
thing
i
planned
hearing
a
voice
o
coward
fight
then
the
clock
stopped
whose
was
the
hand
maybe
was
god
ah
well
all
right
heap
on
me
darkness
fold
on
fold
pain
wrench
and
rack
me
what
care
i
leap
on
me
hunger
thirst
and
cold
i
will
await
my
time
to
die
looking
to
heaven
that
shines
above
looking
to
god
and
love
and
love
x
hark
what
is
that
bells
dogs
again
is
it
a
dream
i
sob
and
cry
see
the
door
opens
men
rush
to
my
rescue
frail
am
i
feeble
and
dying
dazed
and
glad
there
is
the
pistol
where
it
dropped
boys
it
was
hard
but
i
not
look
at
the
clock
it
stopped
it
stopped
carry
me
out
the
heavens
smile
see
there
an
arch
of
gold
above
now
let
me
rest
a
little
while
to
god
and
love
and
dreams
are
best
i
just
think
that
dreams
are
best
just
to
sit
and
fancy
things
give
your
gold
no
acid
test
try
not
how
your
silver
rings
fancy
women
pure
and
good
fancy
men
upright
and
true
fortressed
in
your
solitude
let
life
be
a
dream
to
you
for
i
think
that
thought
is
all
truth
a
minion
of
the
mind
love
ideal
comes
at
call
as
ye
seek
so
shall
ye
find
but
ye
must
not
seek
too
far
things
are
never
what
they
seem
let
a
star
be
just
a
star
and
a
woman
just
a
dream
o
you
dreamers
proud
and
pure
you
have
gleaned
the
sweet
of
life
golden
truths
that
shall
endure
over
pain
and
doubt
and
strife
i
would
rather
be
a
fool
living
in
my
paradise
than
the
leader
of
a
school
sadly
sane
and
weary
wise
o
you
cynics
with
your
sneers
fallen
brains
and
hearts
of
brass
tweak
me
by
my
foolish
ears
write
me
down
a
simple
ass
i
believe
the
real
you
is
the
you
without
a
taint
i
believe
each
woman
too
but
a
slightly
damaged
saint
yes
i
smoke
my
cigarette
vestured
in
my
garb
of
dreams
and
i
borrow
no
regret
all
is
gold
that
golden
gleams
so
i
charm
my
solitude
with
the
faith
that
life
is
blest
brave
and
noble
bright
and
good
oh
i
think
that
dreams
are
best
the
quitter
when
you
lost
in
the
wild
and
you
scared
as
a
child
and
death
looks
you
bang
in
the

an
though
he
objurgated
some
they
cured
him
night
an
day
an
pretty
soon
there
came
the
change
amazin
to
explain
i
never
take
another
drink
sez
timothy
they
tried
it
out
on
spike

that
toper
of

the
terror
of
the

roped
in

from

and
near
an
every
test
was
sure
an
like
a
flame
there
ran
the
fame
of
cure

mighty
queer
sez
dan
i
puzzled
through
and
through
it
only
milk
from
riley
ranch
no
other
milk
will
do
an
it
jest
happened
on
that
night
with
no
predictive
plan
he
left
some
milk
from
riley
ranch
in
a
pan
an
picture
his
amazement
when
he
poured
that
milk
next
day
there
in
the
bottom
of
the
pan
a
dozen
colours
lay
well
what
d
know
that
sez
dan
gosh
ding
my
dasted
eyes
we
been
an
had
the
gold
cure
bill
an
none
of
us
was
wise
the
milk
that
a
cinch
there
colours
everywhere
now
let
us
figger
this
thing
out
how
does
the
dust
git
there
from
the
down
they
say
why
bill
we
got
it
cold
them
cows
what
nibbles
up
the
grass
jest
nibbles
up
the
gold
we
blasted
bloomin
millionaires
dissemble
an
lie
low
we
follow
them
cows
an
prospect
where
they
go
an
so
it
came
to
pass
fer
weeks
them
miners
might
be
found
round
on
riley
ranch
an
snipin
at
the
ground
till
even
riley
stops
an
stares
an
presently
allows
them
boys
appear
to
take
a
mighty
interest
in
cows
an
night
an
day
they
shadowed
each
auriferous
bovine
an
panned
the
on
their
trail
yet
nivver
gold
they
seen
an
all
that
season
they
worked
an
nothin
found
an
there
was
colours
in
the
milk
but
none
was
in
the
ground
an
mighty
desperate
was
they
an
down
upon
their
luck
when
sudden
inspirationlike
the
source
of
it
they
struck
an
where
d
think
they
traced
it
to
it
grieves
my
heart
to
tell
in
the
black
sand
at
the
bottom
of
that
wicked
milkman
while
the
bannock
bakes
light
up
your
pipe
again
old
chum
and
sit
awhile
with
me
i
got
to
watch
the
bannock
bake
how
restful
is
the
air
you
little
think
that
we
were
somewhere
north
of
though
where
i
do
exactly
know
and
do
precisely
care
the
mountains
palisade
us
round
on
every
side
the
river
is
with
fish
and
ripples
the
midnight
sunshine
brims
yon
cleft
we
think
it
the
divide
we
get
there
in
a
month
maybe
or
maybe
in
a
year
it
does
matter
does
it
pal
we
of
that
breed
of
men
with
whom
the
world
of
wine
and
cards
and
women
disagree
your
trouble
was
a
roofless
game
of
poker
now
and
then
and
raising
up
my
elbow
that
what
got
away
with
me
we
merely
undesirables
artistic
more
or
less
my
horny
hands
are
you
quote
your
browning
well
and
yet
we
fooling
round
for
gold
in
this
damned
wilderness
the
joke
is
if
we
found
it
we
would
both
go
straight
to
hell
well
maybe
we
wo
find
it
and
at
least
we
got
the
life
we
both
as
brown
as
berries
and
could
wrestle
with
a
bear
that
bannock
raising
nicely
pal
just
jab
it
with
your
knife
fine
specimens
of
manhood
they
would
reckon
us
out
there
it
the
tracking
and
the
packing
and
the
poling
in
the
sun
it
the
sleeping
in
the
open
it
the
rugged
unfaked
food
it
the
and
the
paddle
and
the
campfire
and
the
gun
and
when
i
think
of
what
i
was
i
know
that
it
is
good
just
think
of
how
we
poled
all
day
up
this
strange
little
stream
since
life
began
no
eye
of
man
has
seen
this
place
before
how
fearless
all
the
wild
things
are
the
banks
with
gleam
and
there
a
bronzy
sitting
sniffing
at
his
door
a
mother
duck
with
brood
of
ten
comes
squattering
along
the
tawny
ptarmigan
are
flying
all
about
and
in
that
swirly
golden
pool
a
restless
gleaming
throng
the
trout
are
waiting
till
we
condescend
to
take
them
out
ah
yes
it
good
i
bet
that
there
no
doctor
like
the
wild
just
turn
that
bannock
over
there
it
getting
nicely
brown
i
might
be
in
my
grave
by
now
forgotten
and
reviled
or
rotting
like
a
sickly
cur
in
some
far
foreign
town
i
might
be
that
vile
thing
i
was
it
all
seems
like
a
dream
i
owed
a
man
a
grudge
one
time
that
only
life
could
pay
and
yet
it
now
how
petty
these
things
seem
but
that
another
story
pal
i
tell
it
you
some
day
how
strange
two
irresponsibles
should
chum
away
up
here
but
round
the
arctic
circle
friends
are
few
and
far
between
we
shared
the
same
and
tent
for
nigh
on
seven
year
and
never
had
a
word
that
was
cheering
and
serene
we
halved
the
toil
and
split
the
spoil
and
borne
each
other
packs
by
all
the
wild
freemasonry
we
brothers
tried
and
true
we
swept
on
danger
side
by
side
and
fought
it
back
to
back
and
you
would
die
for
me
old
pal
and
i
would
die
for
you
now
there
was
that
time
i
got
lost
in
rory
bory
land
how
quick
the
blizzards
sweep
on
one
across
that
polar
sea
you
formed
a
rescue
crew
of
one
and
saw
a
frozen
hand
that
stuck
out
of
a
drift
of
snow
and
partner
it
was
me
but
i
got
even
did
i
not
that
day
the
paddle
broke
white
water
on
the
coppermine
a
rock
a
split
canoe
two
fellows
struggling
in
the
foam
one
could
swim
a
stroke
a
man
i
dragged
ashore
and
partner
it
was
you
in
rory
borealis
land
the
winter
long
and
black
the
silence
seems
a
solid
thing
shot
through
with
wolfish
woe
and
rowelled
by
the
eager
stars
the
skies
vault
vastly
back
and
man
seems
but
a
little
mite
on
that
plateau
no
thing
to
do
but
smoke
and
yarn
of
wild
and
misspent
lives
beside
the
there
we
sat
what
tales
you
told
to
me
of
love
and
hate
and
chance
and
fate
and
temporary
wives
in
rory
borealis
land
beside
the
arctic
sea
one
yarn
you
told
me
in
those
days
i
can
remember
still
it
seemed
as
if
i
visioned
it
so
sharp
you
sketched
it
in
bellona
was
the
name
i
think
a
coast
town
in
brazil
where
nobody
did
anything
but
serenade
and
sin
i
saw
it
all
the
jewelled
sea
the
golden
scythe
of
sand
the
stately
pillars
of
the
palms
the
feathery
bamboo
the
houses
and
the
swart
land
the
people
ever
children
and
the
heavens
ever
blue
you
told
me
of
that
girl
of
yours
that
blossom
of
old
spain
all
glamour
grace
and
witchery
all
passion
verve
and
glow
how
maddening
she
must
have
been
you
made
me
see
her
plain
there
by
our
little
in
the
silence
and
the
snow
you
loved
her
and
she
loved
you
she
a
husband
too
i
think
a
doctor
chap
you
told
me
whom
she
treated
like
a
dog
a
white
man
living
on
the
beach
a
hopeless
slave
to
drink
just
turn
that
bannock
over
there
that
propped
against
the
log
that
story
seemed
to
strike
me
pal
it
happens
every
day
you
had
to
go
away
awhile
then
somehow
it
befell
the
doctor
chap
discovered
gave
her
up
and
disappeared
you
came
back
tired
of
her
in
time
there
nothing
more
to
tell
hist
see
those
willows
silvering
where
swamp
and
river
meet
just
reach
me
up
my
rifle
quick
that
mister
moose
i
know
there
now
got
him
dead
to
but
hell
we
lots
to
eat
i
do
believe
in
taking
life
we
let
the
beggar
go
heigh
ho
i
tired
the
bannock
cooked
it
time
we
both
turned
in
the
morning
mist
is
the
morning
sky
is
gold
the
a
confessional
what
funny
yarns
we
spin
it
sort
of
made
me
think
a
bit
that
story
that
you
told
the
belt
and
rory
bory
are
such
odd
extremes
yet
after
all
how
very
small
this
old
world
seems
to
be
yes
that
was
quite
a
yarn
old
pal
and
yet
to
me
it
seems
you
missed
the
point
the
point
is
that
the
doctor
chap
was
the
lost
master
and
when
i
come
to
die
he
said
ye
shall
not
lay
me
out
in
state
nor
leave
your
laurels
at
my
head
nor
cause
your
men
of
speech
orate
no
monument
your
gift
shall
be
no
column
in
the
hall
of
fame
but
just
this
line
ye
grave
for
me
played
the
game
so
when
his
glorious
task
was
done
it
was
not
of
his
fame
we
thought
it
was
not
of
his
battles
won
but
of
the
pride
with
which
he
fought
but
of
his
zest
his
ringing
laugh
his
trenchant
scorn
of
praise
or
blame
and
so
we
graved
his
epitaph
he
played
the
game
and
so
we
too
in
humbler
ways
went
forth
to
fight
the
fight
anew
and
heeding
neither
blame
nor
praise
we
held
the
course
he
set
us
true
and
we
too
find
the
fighting
sweet
and
we
too
fight
for
fighting
sake
and
though
we
go
down
in
defeat
and
though
our
stormy
hearts
may
break
we
will
not
do
our
master
shame
we
play
the
game
please
god
we
play
the
game
little
moccasins
come
out
o
little
moccasins
and
frolic
on
the
snow
come
out
o
tiny
beaded
feet
and
twinkle
in
the
light
i
play
the
old
red
river
reel
you
used
to
love
it
so
awake
o
little
moccasins
and
dance
for
me
your
hair
was
all
a
gleamy
gold
your
eyes
a
blue
your
cheeks
were
pink
as
tinted
shells
you
stepped
light
as
a
fawn
your
mouth
was
like
a
coral
bud
with
seed
pearls
peeping
through
as
gladdening
as
spring
you
were
as
radiant
as
dawn
come
out
o
little
moccasins
i
play
so
soft
and
low
the
songs
you
loved
the
old
that
in
my
ring
o
child
i
want
to
hear
you
now
beside
the
campfire
glow
with
all
your
heart
in
the
simple
words
you
sing
for
there
was
only
you
and
i
and
you
were
all
to
me
and
round
us
were
the
barren
lands
but
little
did
we
fear
of
all
god
happy
happy
folks
the
happiest
were
oh
call
her
poor
old
fiddle
mine
and
maybe
she
will
hear
your
mother
was
a
cree
but
you
were
white
all
through
and
i
your
father
was
but
well
that
neither
here
nor
there
i
only
know
my
little
queen
that
all
my
world
was
you
and
now
that
world
can
end
and
i
will
never
care
for
there
a
tiny
wooden
cross
that
pricks
up
through
the
snow
poor
little
moccasins
you
tired
and
so
you
lie
at
rest
and
there
a
weary
man
beside
the
campfire
glow
o
fiddle
mine
the
tears
are
drumming
on
your
breast
the
wanderlust
the
wanderlust
has
lured
me
to
the
seven
lonely
seas
has
dumped
me
on
the
of
dearth
the
wanderlust
has
haled
me
from
the
morris
chairs
of
ease
has
hurled
me
to
the
ends
of
all
the
earth
how
bitterly
i
cursed
it
oh
the
painted
desert
knows
the
wraithlike
heights
that
hug
the
pallid
plain
the
silence
yet
the
longing
grows
and
grows
and
i
got
to
glut
the
wanderlust
again
sailor
in
what
a
plight
i
been
tinker
tailor
oh
what
a
sight
i
seen
and
i
hitting
the
trail
in
the
morning
boys
and
you
wo
see
my
heels
for
dust
for
it
all
day
with
you
when
you
answer
the
cue
of
the
the
wanderlust
has
got
me
by
the
fire
by
the
fever
and
the
freezing
and
the
pain
by
the
darkness
that
just
drowns
you
by
the
wail
of
home
desire
i
tried
to
break
the
spell
of
it
in
vain
life
might
have
been
a
feast
for
me
now
there
are
only
crumbs
in
rags
and
tatters
i
sit
yet
there
no
rest
or
peace
for
me
imperious
it
drums
the
wanderlust
and
i
must
follow
it
many
a
mile
i
done
rare
way
fair
way
many
a
height
i
won
but
i
pulling
my
freight
in
the
morning
boys
and
it
over
the
hills
or
bust
for
there
never
a
cure
when
you
list
to
the
lure
of
the
the
wanderlust
has
taught
me
it
has
whispered
to
my
heart
things
all
you
will
never
know
the
white
man
and
the
savage
are
but
three
short
days
apart
three
days
of
cursing
crawling
doubt
and
woe
then
it
down
to
chewing
muclucs
to
the
water
you
can
to
fish
you
bolt
with
nose
held
in
your
hand
when
you
get
right
down
to
cases
it
king
grub
that
rules
the
races
and
the
wanderlust
will
help
you
understand
taunting
that
is
the
spell
of
it
mocking
baulking
that
is
the
hell
of
it
but
i
shoulder
my
pack
in
the
morning
boys
and
i
going
because
i
must
for
it
to
all
when
you
answer
the
call
of
the
the
wanderlust
has
blest
me
in
a
ragged
blanket
curled
i
watched
the
gulf
of
heaven
foam
with
stars
i
walked
with
eyes
wide
open
to
the
wonder
of
the
world
i
seen
god
flood
of
glory
burst
its
bars
i
seen
the
gold
in
the
riffles
of
the
sky
till
i
fancied
me
a
bloated
plutocrat
but
i
freedom
happy
and
i
will
be
till
i
die
and
i
got
to
thank
the
wanderlust
for
that
heart
child
heart
all
of
the
world
your
home
glad
heart
mad
heart
what
can
you
do
but
roam
oh
i
beat
it
once
more
in
the
morning
boys
with
a
pinch
of
tea
and
a
crust
for
you
can
not
deny
when
you
hark
to
the
cry
of
the
the
wanderlust
will
claim
me
at
the
finish
for
its
own
i
turn
my
back
on
men
and
face
the
pole
beyond
the
arctic
outposts
i
will
venture
all
alone
some
land
will
be
my
goal
thank
god
there
none
will
miss
me
for
i
been
a
bird
of
flight
and
in
my
moccasins
i
take
my
call
for
the
wanderlust
has
ruled
me
and
the
wanderlust
has
schooled
me
and
i
ready
for
the
darkest
trail
of
all
land
dim
land
oh
how
the
vastness
calls
far
land
star
land
oh
how
the
stillness
falls
for
you
never
can
tell
if
it
heaven
or
hell
and
i
taking
the
trail
on
trust
but
i
have
a
doubt
that
my
soul
will
leap
out
on
its
the
trapper
christmas
eve
it
mighty
and
drear
above
the
wild
the
moon
rides
high
and
shows
up
sharp
and
the
emptiness
of
earth
and
sky
no
happy
homes
with
love
no
santa
claus
to
make
believe
just
snow
and
snow
and
then
more
snow
it
christmas
eve
it
christmas
eve
and
here
am
i
where
all
things
end
and
undesirables
are
hurled
a
poor
old
man
without
a
friend
forgot
and
dead
to
all
the
world
clean
out
of
sight
and
out
of
mind
well
maybe
it
is
better
so
we
all
in
life
our
level
find
and
mine
i
guess
is
pretty
low
yet
as
i
sit
with
pipe
alight
beside
the
it
queer
this
mind
of
mine
must
take
the
backward
trail
of
fifty
year
the
and
the
christmas
tree
the
children
with
their
cheeks
two
bright
blue
eyes
that
smile
on
me
just
half
a
century
ago
again
it
maybe
forty
years
with
faith
and
trust
almost
divine
these
same
blue
eyes
abrim
with
tears
through
depths
of
love
look
into
mine
a
parting
tender
soft
and
low
with
arms
that
cling
and
lips
that
cleave
ah
me
it
all
so
long
ago
yet
seems
so
sweet
this
christmas
eve
just
thirty
years
ago
again
we
say
a
bitter
our
lips
are
white
with
wrath
and
pain
our
little
children
cling
and
cry
whose
was
the
fault
it
matters
not
for
man
and
woman
both
deceive
it
buried
now
and
all
forgot
forgiven
too
this
christmas
eve
and
she
god
pity
me
is
dead
our
children
men
and
women
grown
i
like
to
think
that
they
are
wed
with
little
children
of
their
own
that
crowd
around
their
christmas
tree
i
would
not
ever
have
them
grieve
or
shed
a
single
tear
for
me
to
mar
their
joy
this
christmas
eve
stripped
to
the
buff
and
gaunt
and
still
lies
all
the
land
in
grim
distress
like
lost
soul
wailing
long
and
shrill
a
cleaves
the
emptiness
then
hushed
as
death
is
everything
the
moon
rides
haggard
and
forlorn
o
hark
the
herald
angels
sing
god
bless
all
men
it
christmas
morn
the
world
all
right
honest
kindly
simple
true
seek
good
in
all
scorn
but
pretence
whatever
sorrow
come
to
you
believe
in
life
beneficence
the
world
all
right
serene
i
sit
and
cease
to
puzzle
over
it
there
much
that
mighty
strange
no
doubt
but
nature
knows
what
she
about
and
in
a
million
years
or
so
we
know
more
than
we
know
old
evolution
under
way
what
ho
the
world
all
right
i
say
could
things
be
other
than
they
are
all
in
its
place
from
mote
to
star
the
thistledown
that
flits
and
flies
could
drift
no
otherwise
what
is
must
be
with
rhythmic
laws
all
nature
chimes
effect
and
cause
the
and
the
sun
obey
what
ho
the
world
all
right
i
say
just
try
to
get
the
cosmic
touch
the
sense
that
you
do
matter
much
a
million
stars
are
in
the
sky
a
million
planets
plunge
and
die
a
million
million
men
are
sped
a
million
million
wait
ahead
each
plays
his
part
and
has
his
day
what
ho
the
world
all
right
i
say
just
try
to
get
the
chemic
view
a
million
million
lives
made
you
in

a
million
you
will
be
immortal
down
eternity
immortal
on

never
death
but
ever
change
you
always
were
and
will
be
aye
what
ho
the
world
all
right
i
say
be
glad
and
do
not
blindly
grope
for
truth
that
lies
beyond
our
scope
a
sober
plot
informeth
all
of
life
uproarious
carnival
your
day
is
such
a
little
one
a
gnat
that
lives
from

yet
gnat
and
you
have
parts
to
play
what
ho
the
world
all
right
i
say
and
though
it
written
from
the
start
just
act
your
best
your
little
part
just
be
as
happy
as
you
can
and
serve
your

just
live

good
that
in
you
lies
and
seek
no
guerdon
of

just
make

what
ho

i
say
remember

not

i
bought
a
dozen
bottles

the

thousand
dollars
now
whether

mighty
hard
to

but

to
have
much
comfort
from
that
day
with
bottles
of
that
dandruff
dope
she
followed
at
his
heels
an
sprinkled
an
massaged
him
even
when
he
ate
his
meals
she
waked
him
from
his
beauty
sleep
with
tender
lovin
care
an
rubbed
an
scrubbed
assiduous
yet
never

well
naturally
all

to

then
missis
jenkins
yielded
bein
rather
in
disgust
an
all

signed
an
witnessed
an
invested
with
a
seal
they
rounded
up
old
an
they
broke
it
what
they
done

they
bought
an
interest
in
his
chance
of
raisin
hair
they
yanked
his
hat
off
anxiouslike
opinin
one
by

their
magnifyin

they
only
got
the
merrier
the

board
the
syndicate
wuz
hopeful
that
they
demonstrate
the
pay
an
missis
jenkins
laboured
in
her
perseverin
way
the
boys
discussed
on
surface
rights
an
an
so
on
an
planned
to
have
it
crown
surveyed
an
blue
prints
of
it
drawn
they
ran

base
line

an
yelled
an
everyone

in
on
this
here
scheme
you
never
raise
a
hair
on
me
when
lo
that
very
night
preparin
to
retire
he
got
a
most
onpleasant
fright
for
on
that
shinin
dome
of
his
so
prominently
bare
he
felt
the
baby
outcrop
of
a
second
growth
of
hair
a
thousand
dollars
sufferin
caesar
well
it
must
be
saved
he
grabbed
his
razor
recklesslike
an
shaved
an
shaved
an
shaved
an
when
his
head
was
smooth
again
he
gives
a
mighty
sigh
an
sneaks
away
an
buys
some
hair
destroyer
on
the
sly
so
there
wuz
missis
jenkins
with

an
with
destroyer
circumventin
her
at
night
the
battle
wuz
a
mighty
one
his
nerves
wuz
on
the
strain
an
yet
in
spite
of
all
he
did
that
hair
began
to
gain
the
situation
grew
intense
so
quietly
one
day
he
gave
his
the
slip
an
made
his
jest
like
a
criminal
he
skipped
an
aimed
to
defalcate
the
jenkins
hirsute
propagation
syndicate
his
guilty
secret
burned
him
an
he
sought
the
city
din
i
got
to
get
a
wig
sez
he
to
cover
up
my
sin
it
growin
growin
night
an
day
it
most
amazin
hair
an
when
he
looked
at
it
that
night
he
shuddered
with
despair
he
shuddered
an
suppressed
a
cry
at
what
his
optics
seen
for
on
my
word
of
honour
boys
that
hair
wuz
growin
at
first
he
guessed
he
get
some
dye
an
try
to
dye
it
black
an
then
he
saw
was
nemmysis
wuz
layin
on
his
track
he
must
jest
face
the
music
an
confess
the
thing
he
done
an
pay
the
boys
an
guinneyveer
the
money
they
had
won
an
then
there
came
a
big
idee
it
thrilled
him
like
a
shock
why
not
control
the
syndicate
by
buyin
up
the
stock
an
so
next
day
he
hurried
back
with
smoothly
shaven
pate
an
for
a
hundred
dollars
he
bought
up
the
syndicate
was
mighty
frenzied
finance
an
the
boys
set
up
a
roar
but
hirsutes
from
the
market
wuz
withdrawn
for
evermore
an
to
this
day
in
nuggetsville
they
tell
the
tale
how
slick
the
syndicate
sold
out
too
soon
and
turned
the
trick
the
mother
there
will
be
a
singing
in
your
heart
there
will
be
a
rapture
in
your
eyes
you
will
be
a
woman
set
apart
you
will
be
so
wonderful
and
wise
you
will
sleep
and
when
from
dreams
you
start
as
of
one
that
wakes
in
paradise
there
will
be
a
singing
in
your
heart
there
will
be
a
rapture
in
your
eyes
there
will
be
a
moaning
in
your
heart
there
will
be
an
anguish
in
your
eyes

see
your
dearest
ones

quivering

and
the
smart

and
lonely
sacrifice

will
be
an
anguish
in
your
eyes

will
come
a
glory
in
your
eyes

a
peace
within

the
love
that
never
dies
you
with
heaven
peace
within
your
heart
you
with
god
own
glory
in
your
eyes
the
dreamer
the
lone
man
gazed
and
gazed
upon
his
gold
his
sweat
his
blood
the
wage
of
weary
days
but
now
how
sweet
how
doubly
sweet
to
hold
all
gay
and
gleamy
to
the
campfire
blaze
the
evening
sky
was
sinister
and
cold
the
willows
shivered
wanly
lay
the
snow
the
uncommiserating
land
so
old
so
worn
so
grey
so
niggard
in
its
woe
peered
through
its
ragged
shroud
the
lone
man
sighed
poured
back
the
gaudy
dust
into
its
poke
gazed
at
the
seething
river
loaded
his
pipe
as
if
to
smoke
then
crushed
with
weariness
and
hardship
crept
into
his
ragged
robe
and
swiftly
hour
after
hour
went
by
a
shadow
slipped
from
vasts
of
shadow
to
the
flame
gripping
a
rifle
with
a
deadly
aim
a
gaunt
and
hairy
man
with
wolfish
eyes
the
sleeper
dreamed
and
lo
this
was
his
dream
he
rode
a
streaming
horse
across
a
moor
sudden
night
a
lightning
gleam
showed
him
a
inn
forlorn
and
poor
a
sullen
host
unbarred
the
creaking
door
and
led
him
to
a
dim
and
dreary
room
wherein
he
sat
and
poked
the
fire
so
that
weird
shadows
jigged
athwart
the
gloom
he
ordered
wine
blood
but
he
was
tired
what
matter
charles
was
crushed
and
george
was
king
his
party
high
in
power
how
he
aspired
red
guineas
packed
his
purse
too
tight
to
ring
the
gleamed
upon
his
silken
hose
his
silver
buckles
and
his
powdered
wig
what
ho
more
wine
he
drank
he
slowly
rose
what
made
the
shadows
dance
that
madcap
jig
he
clutched
the
candle
steered
his
way
to
bed
and
in
a
trice
was
sleeping
like
the
across
the
room
there
crept
so
shadow
soft
his
sullen
host
with
naked
knife
a
gaunt
and
hairy
man
with
wolfish
and
as
he
lay
the
sleeper
dreamed
a
dream
was
in
a
ruder
land
a
wilder
day
a
rival
princeling
sat
upon
his
throne
within
a
dungeon
dark
and
foul
he
lay
with
chains
that
bit
and
festered
to
the
bone
they
haled
him
harshly
to
a
vaulted
room
where
one
gazed
on
him
with
malignant
eye
and
in
that
he
read
his
doom
knowing
that
ere
the
he
must
die
well
he
was
let
them
bring
their
prize
assassins
to
the
bloody
work
his
kingdom
lost
yet
would
he
die
a
king
fearless
and
proud
as
when
he
faced
the
turk
ah
god
the
glory
of
that
great
crusade
the
bannered
pomp
the
gleam
the
splendid
urge
the
crash
of
reeking
combat
blade
to
blade
the
reeling
ranks
and
for
long
he
thought
then
feeling
him
creep
vast
weariness
he
fell
into
a
the
cell
door
opened
soft
the
headsman
came
within
his
hand
a
mighty
axe
a
gaunt
and
hairy
man
with
wolfish
eyes
and
as
he
lay
the
sleeper
dreamed
a
dream
was
in
a
land
unkempt
of
life
red
dawn
where
in
his
sanded
cave
he
dwelt
alone
sleeping
by
day
or
sometimes
worked
upon
his
arrows
and
his
knives
of
stone
by
night
stole
forth
and
slew
the
savage
boar
so
that
he
loomed
a
hunter
of
loud
fame
and
many
a
skin
of
wolf
and
wore
and
counted
many
a
to
his
name
wherefore
he
walked
the
envy
of
the
band
hated
and
feared
but
matchless
in
his
skill
till
lo
one
night
deep
in
that
shaggy
land
he
tracked
a
yearling
bear
and
made
his
kill
then
he
rested
by
a
stream
and
sank
into
a
sleep
too
deep
for
hunting
his
food
a
rival
caveman
crept
through
those
dark
woods
and
marked
him
where
he
lay
cowered
and
crawled
upon
him
as
he
slept
poising
a
mighty
stone
aloft
to
slay
a
gaunt
and
hairy
man
with
wolfish
the
great
stone
crashed
the
dreamer
shrieked
and
woke
and
saw
in
his
dripping
cell
a
gaunt
and
hairy
man
who
with
one
stroke
swung
a
great
ax
of
steel
that
flashed
and
fell
so
that
he
woke
amid
his
bedroom
gloom
and
saw
a
naked
thirsting
knife
a
gaunt
and
hairy
man
with
eyes
of
doom
and
then
the
blade
plunged
down
to
drink
his
life
so
that
he
woke
wrenched
back
his
robe
and
looked
and
saw
beside
his
dying
fire
upstart
a
gaunt
and
hairy
man
with
finger
crooked
a
rifle
rang
a
bullet
searched
his
heart
the
morning
sky
was
sinister
and
cold
grotesque
the
dreamer
sprawled
and
did
not
rise
for
long
and
long
there
gazed
upon
some
gold
gaunt
and
hairy
man
with
wolfish
at
three
score
and
ten
the
psalmist
saith
and
half
my
course
is
run
i
had
my
flout
at
dusty
death
i
had
my
whack
of
feast
and
fun
i
mocked
at
those
who
prate
and
preach
i
laughed
with
any
man
alive
but
now
with
sobered
heart
i
reach
the
great
divide
of
and
looking
back
i
must
confess
i
little
cause
to
feel
elate
i
played
the
mummer
more
or
less
i
fumbled
fortune
flouted
fate
i
vastly
dreamed
and
little
done
i
idly
watched
my
brothers
strive
oh
i
have
loitered
in
the
sun
by
primrose
paths
to
and
those
who
matched
me
in
the
race
well
some
are
out
and
trampled
down
the
others
jog
with
sober
pace
yet
one
wins
delicate
renown
o
midnight
feast
and
famished
dawn
o
gay
hard
life
with
hope
alive
o
golden
youth
forever
gone
how
sweet
you
seem
at
each
of
our
lives
is
just
a
book
as
absolute
as
holy
writ
we
humbly
read
and
may
not
look
ahead
nor
change
one
word
of
it
and
here
are
joys
and
here
are
pains
and
here
we
fail
and
here
we
thrive
o
wondrous
volume
what
remains
when
we
reach
chapter
the
very
best
i
dare
to
hope
ere
fate
writes
finis
to
the
tome
a
wiser
head
a
wider
scope
and
for
the
gipsy
heart
a
home
a
songful
home
with
loved
ones
near
with
joy
with
sunshine
all
alive
watch
me
grow
younger
every
year
old
age
thy
name
is
the
squaw
man
the
comes
to
water
and
the
beaver
overbold
the
net
is
in
the
eddy
of
the
stream
the
teepee
stars
the
vivid
sward
with
russet
red
and
gold
and
in
the
velvet
gloom
the
fire
the
night
is
ripe
with
quiet
rich
with
incense
of
the
pine
from
sanctuary
lake
i
hear
the
loon
the
peaks
are
bright
against
the
blue
and
drenched
with
sunset
wine
and
like
a
silver
bubble
is
the
moon
i
climbed
but
yesterday
a
hundred
miles
around
i
looked
to
see
a
rival
fire
as
in
a
crystal
lens
it
lay
a
land
without
a
bound
all
lure
and
virgin
vastitude
and
dream
the
great
sky
soared
exultantly
the
great
earth
bared
its
breast
all
and
patterned
with
the
pine
the
heedless
hordes
of
caribou
were
streaming
to
the
west
a
land
of
lustrous
mystery
and
mine
yea
mine
to
frame
my
odyssey
oh
little
do
they
know
my
conquest
and
the
kingdom
that
i
keep
the
meadows
of
the
where
the
laughing
grasses
grow
the
rivers
where
the
careless
conies
leap
beyond
the
silent
circle
where
white
men
are
fierce
and
few
i
lord
it
and
i
mock
at
law
like
a
flame
upon
the
water
is
my
little
light
canoe
and
yonder
in
the
fireglow
is
my
squaw
a
squaw
man
yes
that
what
i
am
sneer
at
me
if
you
will
i
gone
the
grilling
pace
that
can
not
last
with
bawdry
bridge
and
brandy
oh
i
drank
enough
to
kill
a
dozen
such
as
you
but
that
is
past
i
swung
round
to
my
senses
found
the
place
where
i
belong
the
city
made
a
madman
out
of
me
but
here
beyond
the
circle
where
there
neither
right
or
wrong
i
leap
from
life
and
i
free
yet
ever
in
the
far
forlorn
by
trails
of
lone
desire
yet
ever
in
the
dawn
white
leer
of
hate
yet
ever
by
the
dripping
kill
beside
the
drowsy
fire
there
comes
the
fierce
for
a
mate
there
comes
the
mad
for
a
woman
clinging
hand
eyes
the
velvet
of
a
breast
and
so
i
sought
the
and
chose
from
out
the
band
the
girl
i
thought
the
sweetest
and
the
best
o
wistful
women
i
have
loved
before
my
dark
disgrace
o
women
fair
and
rare
in
my
home
land
dear
ladies
if
i
saw
you
now
i
turn
away
my
face
then
crawl
to
kiss
your
in
the
sand
and
yet
that
day
the
rifle
jammed
a
wounded
moose
at
bay
a
roar
a
charge
i
faced
it
with
my
knife
a
shot
from
out
the
and
there
the
monster
yes
little
laughing
eyes
you
saved
my
life
the
man
must
have
the
woman
and
we
all
brutes
more
or
less
since
first
the
male
ape
shinned
the
family
tree
and
yet
i
think
i
love
her
with
a
husband
tenderness
and
yet
i
know
that
she
would
die
for
me
oh
if
i
left
you
laughing
eyes
and
nevermore
came
back
god
help
you
girl
i
know
what
you
would
i
see
the
lake
wan
in
the
moon
and
from
the
shadow
black
there
drifts
a
little
birch
canoe
we
here
beyond
the
circle
where
there
never
wrong
nor
right
we
are
spliced
according
to
the
law
but
by
the
gods
i
hail
you
on
this
hushed
and
holy
night
as
the
mother
of
my
children
and
my
squaw
i
see
your
little
slender
face
set
in
the
firelight
glow
i
pray
that
i
may
never
make
it
sad
i
hear
you
croon
a
baby
song
all
and
low
god
bless
you
little
laughing
eyes
i
glad
home
and
love
just
home
and
love
the
words
are
small
four
little
letters
unto
each
and
yet
you
will
not
find
in
all
the
wide
and
gracious
range
of
speech
two
more
so
tenderly
complete
when
angels
talk
in
heaven
above
i
sure
they
have
no
words
more
sweet
than
home
and
love
just
home
and
love
it
hard
to
guess
which
of
the
two
were
best
to
gain
home
without
love
is
bitterness
love
without
home
is
often
pain
no
each
alone
will
seldom
do
somehow
they
travel
hand
and
glove
if
you
win
one
you
must
have
two
both
home
and
love
and
if
you
both
well
then
i
sure
you
ought
to
sing
the
whole
day
long
it
does
matter
if
you
poor
with
these
to
make
divine
your
song
and
so
i
praisefully
repeat
when
angels
talk
in
heaven
above
there
are
no
words
more
simply
sweet
than
home
and
love
i
scared
of
it
all
i
scared
of
it
all
god
truth
so
i
am
it
too
big
and
brutal
for
me
my
nerve
on
the
raw
and
i
do
give
a
damn
for
all
the
hoorah
that
i
see
i
pinned
between
subway
and
overhead
train
where
automobillies
swoop
down
oh
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
timber
again
i
scared
of
the
terrible
town
i
want
to
go
back
to
my
lean
ashen
plains
my
rivers
that
flash
into
foam
my
ultimate
valleys
where
solitude
reigns
my
trail
from
fort
churchill
to
nome
my
forests
packed
full
of
mysterious
gloom
my
agrind
and
aglare
the
city
is
deadfalled
with
danger
and
doom
i
know
that
i
safer
up
there
i
watch
the
wan
faces
that
flash
in
the
street
all
kinds
and
all
classes
i
see
yet
never
a
one
in
the
million
i
meet
has
the
smile
of
a
comrade
for
me
just
jaded
and
panting
like
dogs
in
a
pack
just
tensed
and
intent
on
the
goal
o
god
but
i
lonesome
i
wish
i
was
back
up
there
in
the
land
of
the
pole
i
wish
i
was
back
on
the
hunger
plateaus
and
seeking
the
lost
caribou
i
wish
i
was
up
where
the
coppermine
flows
to
the
kick
of
my
little
canoe
i
like
to
be
far
on
some
weariful
shore
in
the
land
of
the
blizzard
and
bear
oh
i
wish
i
was
snug
in
the
arctic
once
more
for
i
know
i
am
safer
up
there
i
prowl
in
the
canyons
of
dismal
unrest
i
cringe
i
so
weak
and
so
small
i
ca
get
my
bearings
i
crushed
and
oppressed
with
the
haste
and
the
waste
of
it
all
the
slaves
and
the
madman
the
lust
and
the
sweat
the
fear
in
the
faces
i
see
the
getting
the
spending
the
fever
the
fret
it
too
bleeding
cruel
for
me
i
feel
it
all
wrong
but
i
ca
tell
you
why
the
palace
the
hovel
next
door
the
insolent
towers
that
sprawl
to
the
sky
the
crush
and
the
rush
and
the
roar
i
trapped
like
a
fox
and
i
fear
for
my
pelt
i
cower
in
the
crash
and
the
glare
oh
i
want
to
be
back
in
the
avalanche
belt
for
i
know
that
it
safer
up
there
i
scared
of
it
all
oh
afar
i
can
hear
the
voice
of
my
solitudes
call
we
nothing
but
brute
with
a
little
veneer
and
nature
is
best
after
all
there
tumult
and
terror
abroad
in
the
street
there
menace
and
doom
in
the
air
i
got
to
get
back
to
my
beat
the
trail
where
the
cougar
and
meet
the
snows
and
the
with
wolves
at
my
feet
for
it
safer
up
there
be
forming
good
habits
up
there
to
be
starving
on
rabbits
up
there
in
your
hunger
and
woe
though
it
sixty
below
oh
i
know
that
it
safer
up
there
a
song
of
success
ho
we
were
strong
we
were
swift
we
were
brave
youth
was
a
challenge
and
life
was
a
fight
all
that
was
best
in
us
gladly
we
gave

from
the
rally
and
leapt
for
the
height

love
in
a
foam
of
spring
flowers

our
hearts
to
him
on
let
us
press
oh
what
a
triumph
and
pride
shall
be
ours
see
where
it
beacons
the
star
of
success
cares
seem
to
crowd
on
us
so
much
to
do
new
fields
to
conquer
and
time
on
the
wing
grey
hairs
are
showing
a
wrinkle
or
two
somehow
our
footstep
is
losing
its
spring
pleasure
forsaken
us
love
ceased
to
smile
youth
has
been
funeralled
age
travels
fast
sometimes
we
wonder
is
it
worth
while
there
we
have
gained
to
the
summit
at
last
aye
we
have
triumphed
now
must
we
haste
revel
in
victory
why
what
is
wrong
life
choicest
vintage
is
flat
to
the
taste
are
we
too
late
have
we
laboured
too
long
wealth

we
hold
ah
but
the
truth
would
we
not
give
this
vain
glory
of
ours
for
one
mad
glad
year
of
glorious
youth

in
the
springtide
and

boughs
of
balsam
slabs
of
cedar
gummy
fagots
of
the
pine

them
on
me
let
me
hug
them
to
my
eager
heart
of
fire
roaring
soaring
up
to
heaven
as
a
symbol
and
a
sign
bring
me
knots
of
sunny
maple
silver
birch
and
tamarack
leaping
sweeping
i
will
lap
them
with
my
ardent
wings
of
flame
i
will
kindle
them
to
glory
i
will
beat
the
darkness
back
streaming
gleaming
i
will
goad
them
to
my
glory
and
my
fame
bring
me
gnarly
limbs
of
aid
me
in
my
frenzied
fight
strips
of
scaly
writhing
redly
in
my
hold
with
my
lunge
of
lurid
lances
with
my
whips
that
flail
the
night
they
will
burgeon
into
beauty
they
will
foliate
in
gold
let
me
star
the
dim
sierras
stab
with
light
the
inland
seas
roaming
wind
and
roaring
darkness
seek
no
mercy
at
my
hands
i
will
mock
the
marly
heavens
lamp
the
purple
prairies
i
will
flaunt
my
deathless
banners
down
the
far
unhouseled
lands
in
the
vast
and
vaulted
where
the
pillared
forests
frown
by
the
sullen
bestial
rivers
running
where
god
only
knows
on
the
starlit
coral
beaches
when
the
combers
thunder
down
in
the
of
the
barrens
in
the
shudder
of
the
snows
in
a
blazing
belt
of
triumph
from
the
to
the
pine
as
a
symbol
of
defiance
lo
the
wilderness
i
span
and
my
beacons
burn
exultant
as
an
everlasting
sign
of
unending
domination
of
the
mastery
of
man
i
the
life
the
fierce
uplifter
i
that
weaned
him
from
the
mire
i
the

devil
i
the

boy
and
frontiersman
of
every
kind
few
are
you
and

and
lonely
yet
an
army
forms
behind
by
your
shall
they
know
you
ashes
scattered
to
the
wind
peer
into
my
heart
of
solace
break
your
bannock
at
my
blaze
smoking
stretched
in
lazy
shelter
build
your
castles
as
you
gaze
or
it
may
be
deep
in
dreaming
think
of
dim
unhappy
days
let
my
warmth
and
glow
caress
you
for
your
trails
are
grim
and
hard
let
my
arms
of
comfort
press
you
and
o
my
lovers
how
i
bless
you
with
your
lives
so
madly
marred
for
you
seek
the
silent
spaces
and
their
secret
lore
you
glean
for
you
win
the
savage
races
and
the
brutish
wild
you
wean
and
i
gladden
desert
places
where
has
never
been
from
the
pole
unto
the
tropics
is
there
trail
ye
have
not
dared
and
because
you
hold
death
lightly
so
by
death
shall
you
be
spared
as
the
sages
of
the
ages
in
their
pages
have
declared
on
the
roaring
arkilinik
in
a
leaky
bark
canoe
up
the
cloud
of
mount
mckinley
where
the
avalanche
leaps
through
in
the
furnace
of
death
valley
when
the
mirage
glimmers
blue
now
a
smudge
of
wiry
willows
on
the
weary
kuskoquim
now
a
flare
of
gummy
where
vancouver
scaur
is
grim
now
a
gleam
of
sunny
ceiba
when
the
cuban
beaches
dim
always
always
god
great
open
lo
i
burn
with
keener
light
in
the
corridors
of
silence
in
the
vestibules
of
night
the
ferns
and
grasses
gleaming
was
there
ever
gem
so
bright
not
for
weaklings
not
for
women
like
my
brother
of
the
hearth
ring
your
songs
of
wrath
around
me
i
was
made
for
manful
mirth
in
the
lusty
gusty
greatness
on
the
bald
spots
of
the
earth
men
my
masters
men
my
lovers
ye
have
fought
and
ye
have
bled
gather
round
my
ruddy
embers
softly
glowing
is
my
bed
by
my
heart
of
solace
dreaming
rest
ye
and
be
comforted
iii
i
am
dying
o
my
masters
by
my
fitful
flame
ye
sleep
my
purple
plumes
of
glory
droop
forlorn
grey
ashes
choke
and
cloak
me
and
above
the
pines
there
creep
the
stealthy
silver
moccasins
of
morn
there
comes
a
countless
army
it
the
legion
of
the
light
it
tramps
in
gleaming
triumph
round
the
world
and
before
its
jewelled
lances
all
the
shadows
of
the
night
back
in
to
abysmal
darknesses
are
hurled
leap
to
life
again
my
lovers
ye
must
toil
and
never
tire
the
day
of
daring
doing
brightens
clear
when
the
bed
of
spicy
cedar
and
the
jovial
must
only
be
a
memory
of
cheer
there
is
hope
and
golden
promise
in
the
vast
portentous
dawn
there
is
glamour
in
the
glad
effluent
sky
go
and
leave
me
i
will
dream
of
you
and
love
you
when
you
gone
i
have
served
you
o
my
masters
let
me
die
a
little
heap
of
ashes
grey
and
sodden
by
the
rain
blurred
and
blotted
by
the
snow
let
that
be
all
to
tell
of
me
and
glorious
again
ye
things
of
greening
gladness
leap
and
glow
a
black
scar
in
the
sunshine
by
the
or
the
pine
blind
to
the
night
and
dead
to
all
desire
yet
oh
of
life
and
uplift
what
a
symbol
and
a
sign
yet
oh
of
power
and
conquest
what
a
destiny
is
mine
a
little
heap
of
ashes
yea
a
miracle
divine
the
of
a
god
fire
her
letter
i
taking
pen
in
hand
this
night
and
hard
it
is
for
me
my
poor
old
fingers
tremble
so
my
hand
is
stiff
and
slow
and
even
with
my
glasses
on
i
troubled
sore
to
you
little
know
your
mother
boy
you
little
little
know
you
mind
how
brisk
and
bright
i
was
how
straight
and
trim
and
smart
is
weariful
i
am
the
now
and
bent
and
frail
and
grey
i
waiting
at
the
road
end
lad
and
all
that
in
my
heart
is
just
to
see
my
boy
again
before
i
called
away
oh
well
i
mind
the
sorry
day
you
crossed
the
gurly
sea
was
like
the
heart
was
torn
from
me
a
waeful
wife
was
i
you
said
that
you
be
home
again
in
two
years
maybe
three
but
nigh
a
score
of
years
have
gone
and
still
the
years
go
by
i
know
it
cruel
hard
for
you
you
bairnies
of
your
own
i
know
the
siller
hard
to
win
and
folks
have
used
you
ill
but
oh
think
of
your
mother
lad
that
waiting
by
her
lone
and
even
if
you
canna
come
write
and
say
you
aye
even
though
there
little
hope
just
promise
that
you
try
it
weary
weary
waiting
lad
just
say
you
come
next
year
i
thinking
there
will
be
no
i
thinking
soon
i
lie
with
all
the
ones
i
laid
away
but
oh
the
hope
will
cheer
you
know
you
all
that
left
to
me
and
we
are
seas
apart
but
if
you
only
you
come
then
will
i
hope
and
pray
i
waiting
by
the
lad
and
all
that
in
my
heart
is
just
to
see
my
boy
again
before
i
called
away
the
man
who
knew
the
dreamer
visioned
life
as
it
might
be
and
from
his
dream
forthright
a
picture
grew
a
painting
all
the
people
thronged
to
see
and
joyed
therein
till
came
the
man
who
knew
saying
is
bad
why
do
ye
gape
ye
fools
he
painteth
not
according
to
the
schools
the
dreamer
probed
life
mystery
of
woe
and
in
a
book
he
sought
to
give
the
clue
the
people
read
and
saw
that
it
was
so
and
read
again
then
came
the
man
who
knew
saying
ye
witless
ones
this
book
is
vile
it
hath
not
got
the
rudiments
of
style
love
smote
the
dreamer
lips
and
silver
clear
he
sang
a
song
so
sweet
so
tender
true
that
all
the
was
thrilled
to
hear
and
listened
rapt
till
came
the
man
who
knew
saying
his
technique
wrong
he
singeth
ill
waste
not
your
time
the
singer
voice
was
still
and
then
the
people
roused
as
if
from
sleep
crying
what
care
we
if
it
be
not
art
hath
he
not
charmed
us
made
us
laugh
and
weep
come
let
us
crown
him
where
he
sits
apart
then
with
his
picture
spurned
his
book
unread
his
song
unsung
they
found
their
dreamer
the
logger
in
the
moonless
misty
night
with
my
little
pipe
alight
i
am
sitting
by
the
fading
cheer
oh
the
dew
is
falling
chill
on
the
dim
hill
and
the
breakers
in
the
bay
are
moaning
drear
the
toilful
hours
are
sped
the
boys
are
long
abed
and
i
alone
a
weary
vigil
keep
in
the
sightless
sullen
sky
i
can
hear
the
cry
and
the
frogs
in
frenzied
chorus
from
the
creek
and
somehow
the
embers
glow
brings
me
back
the
long
ago
the
days
of
merry
laughter
and
light
song
when
i
sped
the
hours
away
with
the
gayest
of
the
gay
in
the
giddy
whirl
of
fashion
festal
throng
oh
i
ran
a
grilling
race
and
i
little
recked
the
pace
for
the
lust
of
youth
ran
riot
in
my
blood
but
at
last
i
made
a
stand
in
this
land
of
the
and
the
mountain
and
the
flood
and
now
i
got
to
stay
with
an
overdraft
to
pay
for
pleasure
in
the
past
with
future
pain
and
i
not
the
chap
to
whine
for
if
the
chance
were
mine
i
know
i
choose
the
old
life
once
again
with
its
woman
eyes
and
its
flood
of
golden
wine
its
fever
and
its
frolic
and
its
fun
the
old
life
with
its
din
its
laughter
and
its
sin
and
chuck
me
in
the
gutter
when
it
done
ah
well
it
past
and
gone
and
the
memory
is
wan
that
conjures
up
each
old
familiar
face
and
here
by
fortune
hurled
i
am
dead
to
all
the
world
and
i
learned
to
lose
my
pride
and
keep
my
place
my
ways
are
hard
and
rough
and
my
arms
are
strong
and
tough
and
i
hew
the
dizzy
pine
till
darkness
falls
and
sometimes
i
take
a
dive
just
to
keep
my
heart
alive
among
the
gay
saloons
and
dancing
halls
in
the
distant
dinful
town
just
a
little
drink
to
drown
the
cares
that
crowd
and
canker
in
my
brain
just
a
little
joy
to
still
set
my
pulses
all
then
back
to
brutish
labour
once
again
and
things
will
go
on
so
until
one
day
i
shall
know
that
death
has
got
me
cinched
beyond
a
doubt
then
i
crawl
away
from
sight
and
morosely
in
the
night
my
weary
wasted
life
will
peter
out
then
the
boys
will
gather
round
and
they
launch
me
in
the
ground
and
pile
the
stones
the
timber
wolf
to
foil
and
the
moaning
pine
will
wave
overhead
a
nameless
grave
where
the
black
snake
in
the
sunshine
loves
to
coil
and
they
leave
me
there
alone
and
perhaps
with
softened
tone
speak
of
me
sometimes
in
the
glow
as
a
broken
chum
who
has
gone
to
kingdom
come
and
who
went
the
pace
in
england
long
ago
the
passing
of
the
year
my
glass
is
filled
my
pipe
is
lit
my
den
is
all
a
cosy
glow
and
snug
before
the
fire
i
sit
and
wait
to
the
old
year
go
i
dedicate
to
solemn
thought
amid
my
days
this
sober
moment
sadly
fraught
with
much
of
blame
with
little
praise
old
year
upon
the
stage
of
time
you
stand
to
bow
your
last
adieu
a
moment
and
the
prompter
chime
will
ring
the
curtain
down
on
you
your
mien
is
sad
your
step
is
slow
you
falter
as
a
sage
in
pain
yet
turn
old
year
before
you
go
and
face
your
audience
again
that
face
remote
austere
let
us
all
read
the
cost
o
maiden
why
that
bitter
tear
is
it
for
dear
one
you
have
lost
is
it
for
fond
illusion
gone
for
trusted
lover
proved
untrue
o
sweet
so
sad
so
wan
what
hath
the
old
year
meant
to
you
and
you
o
neighbour
on
my
right
so
sleek
so
prosperously
clad
what
see
you
in
that
aged
wight
that
makes
your
smile
so
gay
and
glad
what
opportunity
unmissed
what
golden
gain
what
pride
of
place
what
splendid
hope
o
optimist
what
read
you
in
that
withered
face
and
you
deep
shrinking
in
the
gloom
what
find
you
in
that
filmy
gaze
what
menace
of
a
tragic
doom
what
dark
condemning
yesterdays
what
urge
to
crime
what
evil
done
what
cold
confronting
shape
of
fear
o
haggard
haunted
hidden
one
what
see
you
in
the
dying
year
and
so
from
face
to
face
i
flit
the
countless
eyes
that
stare
and
stare
some
are
with
approbation
lit
and
some
are
shadowed
with
despair
some
show
a
smile
and
some
a
frown
some
joy
and
hope
some
pain
and
woe
enough
oh
ring
the
curtain
down
old
weary
year
it
time
to
go
my
pipe
is
out
my
glass
is
dry
my
fire
is
almost
ashes
too
but
once
again
before
you
go
and
i
prepare
to
meet
the
new
old
year
a
parting
word
that
true
for
we
been
comrades
you
and
i
thank
god
for
each
day
of
there
bless
you
now
old
year

it
immortalised
his
pen
fused
in

magical

smith
had
a
friend
we
call
him
brown
dearer
than
brothers
were
those
two
when
in
the
wassail
smith
would
drown
brown
would
rescue
and
pull
him
through
when
brown
was
needful
smith
would
lend
so
it
fell
as
the
years
went
by
each
on
the
other
would
depend
then
at
the
last
smith
came
to
die
there
brown
sat
in
the
sick
man

still
as
a
stone
in
his
despair
smith
bent
on
him
his
eyes
of
doom
shook

sighed

i
trust

and
so
he
died
smith
was
buried
up
soared
his
sales
lured
you
his
books
in
every
store
exquisite
whimsy
tales
men
devoured
them
and
craved
for
more
so
when
it
slyly
got
about
brown
had
a
posthumous
manuscript
jones
the
publisher
sought
him
out
into
his
pocket
deep
he
dipped
a
thousand
dollars
brown
shook
his
head
the
story
is
not
for
sale
he
said
jones
went
away
then
others
came
tempted
and
taunted
brown
was
true
guarded
at
friendship
shrine
the
fame
of
the
unpublished
story
grew
and
grew
it
a
long
long
lane
that
has
no
end
but
some
lanes
end
in
the
potter
field
smith
to
brown
had
been
more
than
friend
patron
protector
spur
and
shield
poor
dreamy
brown
long
and
lean
with
a
smile
askew
friendless
he
wandered
up
and
down
gaunt
as
a
wolf
as
hungry
too
brown
with
his
lilt
of
saucy
rhyme
brown
with
his
tilt
of
tender
mirth
garretless
in
the
gloom
and
grime
singing
his
glad
mad
songs
of
earth
so
at
last
with
a
faith
divine
down
and
down
to
the
there
as
he
stood
in
a
woeful
plight
tears
on
his
sharp
who
should
chance
to
behold
his
plight
but
the
publisher
the
plethoric
jones
peered
at
him
for
a
little
while
held
out
a
bill
will
you
sell
brown
scanned
it
with
his
twisted
smile
a
thousand
dollars
you
go
to
hell
brown
enrolled
in
the
homeless
host
sleeping
anywhere
anywhen
suffered
strove
became
a
ghost
slave
of
the
lamp
for
other
men
for
and
in
the
abyss
his
soul
he
stripped
yet
in
his
want
his
worst
of
woe
held
he
fast
to
the
manuscript
then
one
day
as
he
chewed
his
pen
half
in
hunger
and
half
despair
creaked
the
door
of
his
garret
den
dick
his
brother
was
standing
there
down
on
the
pallet
bed
he
sank
ashen
his
face
his
voice
a
wail
save
me
brother
i
robbed
the
bank
it
ruin
capture
gaol
yet
there
a
chance
i
could
pay
back
the
money
save
our
name
you
have
a
manuscript
they
say
worth
a
thousand
think
man
the
brown
with
his
heart
the
while
with
his
stern
starved
face
and
his
lips
shuddered
and
smiled
his
twisted
smile
brother
i
guess
you
go
to
gaol
while
poor
brown
in
the
leer
of
dawn
wrestled
with
god
for
the
sacred
fire
came
there
a
woman
weak
and
wan
out
of
the
mob
the
murk
the
mire
frail
as
a
reed
a
fellow
ghost
weary
with
woe
with
sorrowing
two
pale
souls
in
the
legion
lost
lo
love
bent
with
a
tender
wing
taught
them
a
joy
so
deep
so
true
it
seemed
that
the
fabric
shook
thrilled
and
dissolved
in
radiant
dew
then
brown
made
him
a
golden
book
full
of
the
faith
that
life
is
good
that
the
earth
is
a
dream
divinely
fair
lauding
his
gem
of
womanhood
in
many
a
lyric
rich
and
rare
took
it
to
jones
who
shook
his
head
i
will
consider
it
he
said
while
he
considered
brown
wife
lay
clutched
in
the
tentacles
of
pain
then
came
the
doctor
grave
and
grey
spoke
of
decline
of
nervous
strain
hinted
egypt
the
south
of
france
brown
with
terror
was
where
was
the
money
what
the
chance
pitiful
god
the
manuscript
a
thousand
dollars
his
only
hope
he
gazed
and
gazed
at
the
garret
reached
at
last
for
the
envelope
turned
to
his
wife
and
told
her
all
told
of
his
friend
his
promise
true
told
like
his
very
heart
would
break
oh
my
dearest
what
shall
i
do
shall
i
not
sell
it
for
your
sake
ghostlike
she
lay
as
still
as
doom
turned
to
the
wall
her
weary
head
in
the
pallid
gloom
silent
as
death
at
last
she
said
do
my
husband
keep
your
vow
guard
his
secret
and
let
me
oh
my
dear
i
must
tell
you
now
woman
he
loved
and
wronged
was
darling
i
have
long
to
live
i
never
told
you
forgive
forgive
for
a
long
long
time
brown
did
not
speak
sat
in
the
wretched
room
slowly
a
tear
stole
down
his
cheek
and
he
kissed
her
hand
in
the
dismal
gloom
to
break
his
oath
to
brand
her
shame
his
friend
his
worshipped
wife
to
keep
his
vow
to
save
her
name
yet
at
the
cost
of
what
her
life
a
moment
space
did
he
hesitate
a
moment
of
pain
and
dread
and
doubt
then
he
broke
the
seals
and
stern
as
fate
unfolded
the
sheets
and
spread
them
on
his
knees
by
her
side
he
limply
sank
peering
amazed
page
was
for
oh
the
supremest
of
our
art
are
the
stories
we
do
not
dare
to
tell
locked
in
the
silence
of
the
heart
for
the
awful
records
of
and
hell
yet
those
two
in
the
silence
there
seemed
less
weariful
than
before
hark
a
step
on
the
garret
stair
a
postman
knocks
at
the
flimsy
door
registered
letter
brown
thrills
with
fear
opens
and
reads
then
bends
above
glorious
tidings
egypt
dear
the
book
is
accepted
life
and
love
little
cabin
o
dear
little
cabin
i
loved
you
so
long
and
now
i
must
bid
you
i
filled
you
with
laughter
i
thrilled
you
with
song
and
sometimes
i
wished
i
could
cry
your
walls
they
have
witnessed
a
weariful
fight
and
rung
to
a
won
waterloo
but
oh
in
my
triumph
i
dreary
little
cabin
to
you
your
roof
is
bewhiskered
your
floor
is
your
walls
seem
to
sag
and
to
swing
i
trying
to
find
just
your
faults
but
i
ca
you
poor
tired
old
thing
i
seen
when
you
been
the
best
friend
that
i
had
your
light
like
a
gem
on
the
snow
you
sort
of
a
part
of
me
gee
but
i
sad
i
hate
little
cabin
to
go
below
your
cracked
window
red
raspberries
climb
a
hornet
nest
hangs
from
a
beam
your
rafters
are
scribbled
with
adage
and
rhyme
and
dimmed
with
tobacco
and
dream
each
day
has
its
laugh
and
do
worry
just
work
such
mottoes
reproachfully
shine
old
calendars
dangle
what
memories
lurk
about
you
dear
cabin
of
mine
i
hear
the
and
the
clang
of
the
fight
i
hear
the
hoarse
cry
of
my
kind
yet
well
do
i
know
as
i
quit
you
it
youth
that
i
leaving
behind
and
often
i
think
of
you
empty
and
black
moose
antlers
nailed
over
your
door
oh
if
i
should
perish
my
ghost
will
come
back
to
dwell
in
you
cabin
once
more
how
cold
still
and
lonely
how
weary
you
seem
a
last
wistful
look
and
i
go
oh
will
you
remember
the
lad
with
his
dream
the
lad
that
you
comforted
so
the
shadows
enfold
you
it
drawing
the
evening
star
needles
the
sky
and
huh
but
it
stinging
and
stabbing
my
sight
god
bless
you
old
cabin
heart
o
the
north
and
when
i
come
to
the
dim
i
who
have
been
life
rover
this
is
all
i
would
ask
my
friend
over
and
over
and
over
a
little
space
on
a
stony
hill
with
never
another
near
me
sky
o
the
north
that
vast
and
still
with
a
single
star
to
cheer
me
star
that
gleams
on
a
stone
graven
by
those
who
love
me
there
would
i
lie
alone
alone
with
a
single
pine
above
me
pine
that
the
north
wind
whinneys
through
oh
i
have
been
life
lover
but
there
i
lie
and
listen
to
eternity
passing
over
the
scribe
prayer
when
from
my
fumbling
hand
the
tired
pen
falls
and
in
the
twilight
weary
droops
my
head
while
to
my
quiet
heart
a
still
voice
calls
calls
me
to
join
my
kindred
of
the
dead
grant
that
i
may
o
lord
ere
rest
be
mine
write
to
thy
praise
one
radiant
ringing
line
for
all
of
worth
that
in
this
clay
abides
the
leaping
rapture
and
the
ardent
flame
the
hope
the
high
resolve
the
faith
that
guides
all
all
is
thine
and
liveth
in
thy
name
lord
have
i
dallied
with
the
sacred
fire
lord
have
i
trailed
thy
glory
in
the
mire
as
a
toper
from
the
reeling
sees
in
his
garret
blackness
dazzling
fair
all
that
he
might
have
been
and
kneeling
sobs
in
the
passion
of
a
vast
despair
so
my
ideal
self
haunts
me
alway
when
the
accounting
comes
how
shall
i
pay
for
in
the
dark
i
grope
nor
understand
and
in
my
heart
fight
selfishness
and
sin
yet
lord
i
do
not
seek
thy
helping
hand
rather
let
me
my
own
salvation
win
let
me
through
strife
and
penitential
pain
onward
and
upward
to
the
heights
attain
yea
let
me
live
my
life
its
meaning
seek
bear
myself
fitly
in
the
ringing
fight
strive
to
be
strong
that
i
may
aid
the
weak
dare
to
be
true
o
god
the
light
the
light
cometh
the
dark
so
soon
i
mocked
thy
word
yet
do
i
know
thy
love
