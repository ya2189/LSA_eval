has

of
some
eternal

mighty

through

the
song
i
sing
the
vague
commotion
from
its
ancestral
home
booms
like
the
shout
of
ocean
across
the
crumbling
foam
and
these
low
lyric
whispers
make
answer
wistfully
as
dreaming
lispers
beside
the
eternal
sea
laus
mariæ
there
is
a
name
like
some
deep
melody
hallowed
by
sundown
delicate
as
the
plash
of
lonely
waves
on
solitary
lakes
and
rounded
as
the
bloom
of
bold
notes
in
a
midnight
cloud
when
shadowy
belfries
far
away
roll
out
across
the
dark
their
avalanche
of
sound
it
is
a
wild
voice
lost
in
the
wail
of
the
wind
the
plectrum
of
the
rain
plays
in
the
poplar
tree
no
other
tune
and
pines
intone
it
softly
as
a
prayer
in
leafy
litanies
the
name
is
raised
even
to
god
ear
from
ancient
arches
dim
with
caverned
twilight
and
dull
altar
smoke
where
tapers
weave
athwart
the
azure
haze
innumerable
pageantries
of
dusk
and
women
must
they
live
who
bear
that
holy
name
and
now
for
one
time
has
no
other
honor
than
to
be
the
meaning
of
an
unremembered
rhyme
the
breath
of
a
forgotten
singer
song
recollection
i
must
forget
awhile
the
mellow
flutes
and
all
the
lyric
wizardry
of
strings
the
fragile
clarinet
tremulous
over
meadows
rich
with
dawn
must
knock
against
my
vagrant
heart
and
throb
and
cry
no
more
for
i
am
shaken
by
the
loveliness
and
lights
and
laughter
and
beguiling
song
of
all
this
siren
world
the
regal
beauty
of
women
round
on
round
the
swift
lithe
slenderness
of
girls
and
children
loyal
eyes
hill
rivers
and
the
lilac
fringe
of
seas
lazily
plunging
glow
of
city
nights
and
faces
in
the
glow
these
things
have
stolen
my
heart
away
i
lie
parcelled
abroad
in
sound
and
hue
dispersed
through
all
i
love
i
must
go
far
away
to
a
still
place
and
draw
the
shadows
down
across
my
eyes
and
wait
and
listen
there
for
wings
vibrating
from
beyond
the
stars
swiftly
winnowing
wings
bearing
me
back
mine
own
so
soon
now
i
shall
lie
deep
hidden
away
from
sound
or
sight
with
hearing
strangely
dull
and
eyes
is
time
o
passionate
soul
for
me
to
go
some
far
road
apart
and
learn
the
ways
of
peace
nightfall
in
a
crumbling
glory
sets
the
unhastening
sun
the
fishers
draw
their
shining
nets
the
day
is
done
across
the
ruddy
wine
that
brims
the
sea
black
boats
drag
shoreward
through
the
brine
dreamily
and
dark
against
the
glow
firing
the
west
by
three
and
two
the
great
gulls
go
seaward
to
rest
beneath
the
gradual
host
of
heaven
pale
and
glimmering
rides
a
dim
a
large
slow
sail
slowly
she
cometh
on
day
last
faint
breath
drifting
across
the
water
wan
and
gray
as
death
from
what
land
swimmeth
thy
keel
dim
ship
and
what
mysterious
hand
is
at
thy
wheel
what
news
for
me
what
vast
release
quiet
is
in
my
heart
and
on
the
sea
peace
a
ballad
of
love
and
death
she
winded
on
the
castle
horn
she
clamored
long
and
bold
for
she
was
and
forlorn
and
she
was
sore
and
she
stood
lonely
in
the
snow
vague
quiet
filled
the
air
from
heaven
roof
looked
down
aloof
the
stars
with
steady
stare
she
heard
the
droning
drift
of
snow
and
the
on
the
hill
no
other
sound
for
leagues
around
the
night
was
very
still
she
cried
aloud
in
sudden
fright
open
warder
ho
here
is
a
pilgrim
guest
who
can
no
farther
go
the
steady
beat
of
mailed
feet
in
angry
answer
rang
along
the
floor
the
castle
door
gave
in
with
iron
clang
and
the
warder
strode
into
his
tower
and
saw
her
standing
there
weary
like
a
flower
and
like
an
angel
fair
here
is
no
lodging
for
the
night
no
bread
and
wine
for
thee
no
ingle
bright
no
warm
firelight
no
cheerful
company
here
is
no
inn
nor
any
kin
of
thine
to
harbor
guest
nor
thee
to
house
will
any
rouse
out
of
his
ancient
rest
unearthly
dark
nocturnal
things
with
faint
and
furtive
stir
hovered
on
wings
round
the
fair
face
of
her
as
she
made
answer
wearily
ah
open
now
the
gate
though
i
was
fleet
with
willing
feet
i
have
come
very
late
yea
though
i
came
through
flood
and
flame
through
tempest
flood
and
fire
and
left
the
wind
to
trail
behind
the
wings
of
my
desire
and
though
i
prayed
the
stars
for
aid
and
seas
for
wind
and
tide
and
though
god
gave
me
goodly
pave
and
ran
himself
beside
aye
though
my
feet
have
been
thus
fleet
unto
one
heart
i
know
whose
sleep
is
still
beneath
the
hill
my
coming
has
been
slow
and
he
bent
gently
down
above
a
soft
light
in
his
eye
is
not
the
holy
name
of
love
the
name
men
call
thee
by
ah
love
i
know
thee
for
thy
face
is
fair
a
great
light
of
some
heavenly
place
is
on
thy
shining
hair
but
thou
love
who
canst
tread
the
stars
whose
seat
is
by
god
throne
why
wilt
thou
bend
thee
to
the
dust
and
walk
the
dark
alone
thy
ways
are
not
our
mortal
ways
hast
thou
nought
else
to
do
than
wander
with
thy
face
our
glimmering
darkness
through
but
love
made
answer
and
her
voice
was
as
god
voice
to
him
as
tall
and
fair
she
towered
there
as
heavenly
seraphim
open
the
gate
for
love
shall
dwell
even
among
the
dead
and
in
the
darkest
deeps
of
hell
open
for
god
hath
said
birds
of
passage
dropping
round
and
clear
across
the
still
miles
ringing
down
the
midnight
marble
stair
a
bird
cry
is
falling
through
the
darkness
falling
from
the
fields
of
upper
air
through
the
rainy
fragrance
of
the
april
night
slow
it
falls
circling
in
the
fall
and
all
the
sheeted
lake
of
sleeping
silences
is
troubled
by
the
solitary
call
each
human
heart
awake
knows
the
loneliness
of
that
strange
voice
clear
and
far
that
lost
voice
searching
through
the
midnight
that
lonely
star
calling
to
a
star
old
memories
are
thronging
through
the
darkness
slow
tears
are
blinding
sleepless
eyes
o
lonely
hearts
remembering
in
the
midnight
o
dark
and
empty
skies
waste
reluctant
groping
fog
crept
gray
and
cold
up
from
the
fields
where
now
the
guns
were
still
far
off
the
thundering
surge
of
battle
rolled
and
darkness
brooded
on
the
quiet
hill
clearly
across
the
listening
night
the
shrill
and
rhythmic
cry
of
a
lonely
cricket
fell
on
ears
long
deafened
by
the
scream
of
shot
and
shell
and
there
were
two
who
listened
wistfully
to
that
glad
voice
that
sad
last
voice
of
all
who
on
the
morrow
after
reveille
would
make
no
answer
to
the
muster
call
others
would
eat
their
mess
others
would
fall
when
the
lines
formed
again
into
their
places
and
soon
their
marching
comrades
would
forget
their
faces
one
moaned
a
little
and
the
other
turned
painfully
sidewise
peering
up
the
bare
slope
then
while
his
deep
wound
burned
he
crawled
slow
inch
by
weary
inch
to
where
the
boy
lay
young
he
thought
and
strangely
fair
you
see
i
came
he
said
it
was
a
wrench
i
thought
i
die
let
have
a
light
here
what
you
french
no
matter
we
be
going
pretty
soon
dying
a
lonesome
business
at
the
best
and
when
there
nothing
but
a
ghastly
moon
and
fog
for
company
i
lose
my
zest
there
a
girl
somewhere
well
you
know
the
rest
i
glad
i
came
it
hand
in
hand
now
brother
i
think
i
laid
you
here
i
wish
had
been
another
i
never
meant
it
and
you
did
mean
for
me
this
ugly
gash
along
my
side
something
has
pushed
us
on
our
slate
is
clean
and
long
and
long
after
we
two
have
died
some
learnedest
of
doctors
will
decide
what
thing
it
was
but
we
we
never
know
our
business
now
to
help
make
next
year
harvest
grow
you
been
at
school
college
de
france
you
know
next
year
i
should
have
heard
your
bergson
there
greatest
since
hegel
think
of
haeckel
though
at
my
own
jena
mighty
men
they
were
not
mighty
enough
for
what
they
had
to
bear
they
read
and
wrote
and
taught
but
you
and
i
how
have
we
profited
at
last
well
here
we
lie
if
i
had
known
you
by
the
silver
rhine
that
dreamy
country
where
i
had
my
birth
the
land
of
golden
corn
and
golden
wine
and
surely
i
think
the
world
most
lovely
earth
i
should
have
loved
you
brother
and
known
your
worth
but
you
were
born
beside
the
racing
rhone
ah
yes
that
made
the
difference
that
thing
alone
we
might
have
fronted
this
world
stormy
weather
hand
clasped
in
hand
and
seeing
eye
to
eye
what
was
there
we
could
not
have
done
together
who
dares
to
say
we
should
have
feared
to
die
shoulder
to
shoulder
standing
you
and
i
but
now
you
are
slain
by
me
your
unknown
friend
i
die
by
your
unknowing
hand
this
this
is
the
end
and
all
the
love
that
might
have
been
is
blown
far
off
like
clouds
that
fade
across
the
blue
the
game
is
over
and
the
night
shuts
down
blotting
the
little
dreams
of
me
and
you
and
all
our
hope
of
all
we
longed
to
do
but
courage
comrade
it
not
hard
to
die
it
not
so
lonely
now
if
only
we
know
why
the
folded
closer
round
the
hill
and
stillness
deepened
but
the
cricket
song
tore
at
the
heavy
hem
of
silence
still
one
small
voice
left
of
love
in
a
world
of
wrong
a
few
dim
stars
looked
down
the
yelling
throng
of
guns
had
passed
beyond
the
mountain
brow
when
once
again
he
spoke
but
slowly
faintlier
now
something
discovered
that
it
did
need
us
me
in
the
fatherland
and
you
in
france
we
were
less
worth
than
what
it
took
to
feed
us
and
so
life
gave
us
only
a
little
glance
it
true
to
say
we
never
had
a
chance
it
like
this
fog
around
above
below
reach
out
your
hand
to
me
we
never
know
and
then
they
lay
so
still
they
seemed
asleep
for
death
was
near
and
they
had
little
pain
the
midnight
did
not
hear
them
moan
or
weep
for
life
and
love
and
gladness
lost
in
vain
and
faces
they
would
never
see
again
old
friends
old
lovers
all
seemed
at
a
distance
the
minutes
crept
and
crept
they
made
no
strong
resistance
they
only
lay
and
looked
up
at
the
stars
feeling
they
had
not
known
how
fair
they
were
i
think
their
hearts
were
far
from
those
loud
wars
as
they
lay
listening
to
the
cricket
chirr
until
it
faded
to
a
drowsy
blur
dwindled
and
died
lost
in
the
distant
roar
of
waves
that
plunged
and
broke
on
some
eternal
shore
the
watcher
in
the
sky
she
has
grown
pale
and
spectral
with
our
wounds
and
she
is
worn
with
memories
of
woe
older
than
karnak
multitudinous
feet
of
all
the
phantom
armies
of
the
world
resounding
down
the
hollow
halls
of
time
have
kept
their
rumor
in
her
ear
for
she
was
old
when
nineveh
and
tyre
and
baalbec
of
the
waste
went
down
in
blood
pompey
and
tamburlaine
and
genghis
khan
are
dreams
of
only
yesternight
to
her
and
still
she
keeps
chained
to
a
loathsome
thing
her
straining
distant
paces
up
and
down
the
vaulted
cell
but
wistful
of
an
end
when
all
our
swarm
of
shuddering
life
shall
drop
like
some
dead
cooling
cinder
down
the
void
leaving
her
clean
in
blessed
barrenness
housemates
this
little
flickering
planet
is
such
a
lonely
spark
among
the
million
mighty
fires
that
blaze
in
the
outer
dark
the
homeless
waste
about
us
leaves
such
a
narrow
span
to
this
dim
lodging
for
a
night
this
bivouac
of
man
that
all
the
heavens
wonder
in
all
their
alien
stars
to
see
us
wreck
our
fellowship
in
mad
fraternal
wars
pomp
and
circumstance
with
a
shout
of
trumpets
and
roll
of
drums
down
the
road
the
music
comes
and
all
my
heart
leaps
up
to
greet
the
steady
tread
of
the
marching
feet
blare
of
bugle
and
shriek
of
fife
this
is
the
triumphing
wine
of
life
my
senses
reel
and
my
glad
heart
sings
my
spirit
soars
on
jubilant
wings
fluttering
banners
and
gonfalons
cover
with
beauty
the
murderous
guns
is
sweet
to
live
were
great
to
die
with
this
vast
music
marching
by
for
all
my
heart
leaps
up
to
greet
the
steady
tread
of
the
marching
feet
when
down
the
road
the
music
comes
with
a
shout
of
trumpets
and
roll
of
drums
the
hidden
weaver
there
where
he
sits
in
the
cold
in
the
gloom
of
his
place
by
his
thundering
loom
he
weaves
on
the
shuttles
of
day
and
of
night
the
shades
of
our
sorrow
and
shapes
of
delight
he
has
wrought
him
a
glimmering
garment
to
fling
over
the
sweet
swift
limbs
of
the
spring
he
has
woven
a
fabric
of
wonder
to
be
for
a
blue
and
a
billowy
robe
to
the
sea
he
has
fashioned
in
sombre
funereal
dyes
a
tissue
of
gold
for
the
midnight
skies
but
sudden
the
woof
turns
all
to
red
has
he
lost
his
craft
has
he
snapped
his
thread
sudden
the
web
all
sanguine
runs
does
he
hear
the
yell
of
the
thirsting
guns
while
the
scarlet
crimes
and
the
crimson
sins
grow
from
the
dizzying
outs
and
ins
of
the
shuttle
that
spins
does
he
see
it
and
feel
or
is
he
the
slave
of
a
tyrannous
wheel
inscrutable
faces
mysterious
eyes
are
watching
him
out
of
the
drifting
skies
exiles
of
chaos
crowd
through
the
gloom
of
the
uttermost
cold
to
that
thundering
room
and
whisper
and
peer
through
the
dusk
to
mark
what
thing
he
is
weaving
there
in
the
dark
will
he
leave
the
loom
that
he
won
from
them
and
rend
his
fabric
from
hem
to
hem
is
he
weaving
with
daring
and
skill
sublime
a
wonderful
for
time
ah
but
he
sits
in
a
darkling
place
hiding
his
hands
hiding
his
face
hiding
his
art
behind
the
shine
of
the
web
that
he
weaves
so
long
and
fine
loudly
the
great
wheel
hums
and
rings
and
we
hear
not
even
the
song
that
he
sings
over
the
whirr
of
the
shuttles
and
all
the
roar
and
the
rush
does
he
hear
when
we
call
only
the
colors
that
grow
and
glow
swift
as
the
hurrying
shuttles
go
only
the
figures
vivid
or
dim
that
flow
from
the
hastening
hands
of
him
only
the
fugitive
shapes
are
we
wrought
in
the
web
of
eternity
vanitas
three
queens
of
old
in
yemen
beside
forgotten
streams
three
tall
and
stately
women
dreamt
three
great
stately
dreams
of
love
and
power
and
pleasure
and
conquering
quinqueremes
they
dreamt
of
love
that
squandered
all
egypt
for
a
kiss
they
dreamt
of
fame
and
pondered
on
proud
persepolis
but
most
they
yearned
for
the
wild
delights
of
pale
semiramis
they
had
for
lords
and
lovers
dark
kings
of
araby
corsairs
and
wild
from
many
an
alien
lea
men
who
loved
and
fought
and
won
them
cruelly
they
reared
a
dreamlike
palace
stately
and
white
and
tall
as
a
lily
ivory
chalice
where
every
echoing
hall
was
rumorous
with
rustling
leaves
and
plashing
water
fall
there
to
the
tinkling
zither
and
passionate
guitars
they
footed
hence
and
hither
beneath
the
breathless
stars
from
bare
round
breast
and
shoulder
waved
their
glimmering
cymars
theirs
was
an
empire
treasure
of
gems
and
rich
attire
love
had
they
beyond
measure
and
wine
that
burnt
like
fire
each
stately
queen
in
yemen
found
verily
her
desire
but
beauty
waned
and
smouldered
love
languished
into
lust
the
centuries
have
mouldered
their
raven
hair
to
rust
the
desert
sand
is
over
them
their
darkling
eyes
are
dust
their
bosoms
pride
is
sunken
beneath
the
purple
pall
their
smooth
round
limbs
are
shrunken
through
clasp
and
anklet
crawl
lithe
little
snakes
upon
their
tombs
lean
lizards
twitch
and
sprawl
spenser
faërie
queene
like
some
clear
well
of
water
in
the
waste
some
magic
well
beside
the
weary
miles
this
beauty
is
i
turn
aside
and
taste
the
cool
lethean
drink
suddenly
smiles
a
leafy
world
upon
me
peristyles
of
flickering
shade
the
hush
is
only
stirred
where
silver
runlets
brighten
down
the
aisles
from
pool
to
pool
rehearsing
one
low
word
answered
at
drowsy
intervals
by
a
lonely
bird
along
the
rustling
arches
and
through
vast
dim
caverns
of
green
solitude
are
rolled
the
wintry
leaves
of
all
the
withered
past
one
confraternity
of
common
mould
from
summers
perished
autumn
tarnished
gold
long
blown
to
dust
in
many
a
fallen
glade
is
reared
this
rumorous
temple
this
shrine
of
peace
this
whispering
colonnade
trembling
from
court
to
court
with
restless
sun
and
shade
and
here
a
while
may
weary
fancy
turn
and
loiter
by
the
rote
of
guttural
streams
brushing
the
skirts
of
silence
the
stirred
fern
breathes
softly
hush
and
hush
a
sound
that
seems
only
the
fluttering
sigh
of
deepest
dreams
here
comes
no
sound
or
sight
of
fevered
things
no
sight
or
sound
the
daylight
beams
and
deep
in
the
heart
of
dusk
a
far
bird
sings
faint
as
the
feathered
beat
of
her
own
wavering
wings
calm
singer
in
the
chambers
of
the
dawn
our
hearts
are
weary
singing
in
the
heat
when
all
thy
dewy
matin
hopes
are
gone
and
all
thy
raptures
prophesyings
sweet
and
fair
false
dreams
are
flying
in
defeat
o
thou
the
poet
poet
from
thy
sky
of
ancient
morning
look
thou
down
and
greet
thy
brothers
of
the
noon
with
gentle
eye
lift
them
from
out
the
dust
forlorn
and
low
they
lie
poet
sing
to
us
like
bells
across
wide
waters
paven
by
the
stains
of
sunset
like
a
vagrant
breeze
that
swells
and
rises
lingering
fails
and
grows
and
wanes
along
a
listening
wood
like
april
rains
in
which
the
anemones
of
dream
are
born
and
though
you
can
not
save
us
from
the
pains
of
life
the
heat
the
insensate
noise
the
scorn
here
may
we
find
our
rose
forget
a
while
the
thorn
morning
road
song
let
me
have
my
fill
of
the
wide
blue
air
and
the
emerald
cup
of
the
sea
and
a
wandering
road
blown
bright
and
bare
and
it
is
enough
for
me
the
love
of
a
man
is
a
goodly
thing
and
the
love
of
a
woman
is
true
but
give
me
a
rollicking
song
to
sing
and
a
love
that
is
always
new
for
i
am
a
rover
and
can
not
stay
and
blithe
at
heart
am
i
when
free
and
afoot
on
a
winding
way
beneath
the
great
blue
sky
evening
road
song
it
a
long
road
and
a
steep
road
and
a
weary
road
to
climb
the
air
bites
chill
on
the
windy
hill
at
home
it
is
firelight
time
the
sunset
pales
along
the
vales
the
cottage
candles
shine
and
twinkle
through
the
early
dew
thank
god
that
one
is
mine
and
dark
and
late
she
watch
and
wait
beyond
the
last
long
mile
for
the
weary
beat
of
homing
feet
with
her
wise
and
patient
smile
windy
morning
dawn
with
a
jubilant
shout
leaps
on
the
shivering
sea
and
puffs
the
last
pale
planet
out
and
scatters
the
clouds
about
like
the
leaves
of
a
tree
does
a
gold
seed
split
the
rosy
husk
nay
a
sword
a
shield
a
spear
the
kindler
of
all
fires
that
burn
deep
in
the
day
cerulean
urn
rides
up
across
the
clear
and
tramples
down
the
cowering
dusk
like
a
charioteer
blow
out
and
far
away
the
dim
the
dull
the
dun
prosper
the
crimson
blight
the
gray
and
blow
us
clean
of
yesterday
stern
morning
fair
begun
till
the
earth
is
an
opal
bathed
in
dew
flashing
with
emerald
gold
and
blue
held
where
the
skies
wash
through
and
through
high
up
against
the
sun
the
grave
of
thoreau
brown
earth
blue
sky
and
solitude
three
things
he
loved
three
things
he
wooed
lifelong
and
now
no
rhyme
can
tell
how
ultimately
all
is
well
with
his
wild
heart
that
worshipped
epiphany
in
crumbling
sods
and
like
an
oak
brought
all
its
worth
back
to
the
kindly
mother
earth
but
something
starry
something
bold
eludes
the
clutch
of
dark
and
mould
something
that
will
not
wholly
die
out
of
the
old
familiar
sky
no
spell
in
all
the
lore
of
graves
can
still
the
plash
of
walden
waves
or
wash
away
the
azure
stain
of
concord
skies
from
heart
and
brain
clear
psalteries
and
faint
citoles
only
recall
the
orioles
fluting
reveille
to
the
morn
across
the
acres
of
the
corn
he
wanders
somewhere
lonely
still
along
a
solitary
hill
and
sits
by
ever
lonelier
fires
remote
from
heaven
bright
rampires
a
hermit
in
the
blue
beyond
beside
some
dim
celestial
pond
with
beans
to
hoe
and
wood
to
hew
and
halcyon
days
to
loiter
through
and
angel
visitors
no
doubt
who
shut
the
air
and
sunlight
out
but
he
who
scoffed
at
human
ways
and
finding
us
unworthy
of
praise
sang
misanthropic
pæans
to
the
muskrat
and
the
feverfew
will
droop
those
archangelic
wings
with
praise
of
how
we
manage
things
prefer
his
walden
tupelo
to
even
the
tree
of
life
and
grow
a
little
wistful
looking
down
across
the
fields
of
concord
town
no
lapidary
heaven
no
brazier
hell
for
me
for
i
am
made
of
dust
and
dew
and
stream
and
plant
and
tree
i
close
akin
to
boulders
i
am
cousin
to
the
mud
and
all
the
winds
of
all
the
skies
make
music
in
my
blood
i
want
a
brook
and
pine
trees
i
want
a
storm
to
blow
across
the
looming
hills
with
rain
and
sleet
and
snow
do
put
me
off
with
diadems
and
thrones
of
chrysoprase
i
want
the
winds
of
northern
nights
and
wild
march
days
my
blood
runs
red
with
sunset
my
body
is
white
with
rain
and
on
my
heart
auroral
skies
have
set
their
scarlet
stain
my
thoughts
are
green
with
spring
time
among
the
meadow
rue
i
think
my
very
soul
is
growing
green
and
gold
and
blue
what
will
be
left
i
wonder
when
death
has
washed
me
clean
of
dust
and
dew
and
sundown
and
april
virgin
green
if
there
enough
to
make
a
ghost
i
bring
it
back
again
to
the
little
lovely
earth
that
bore
me
body
soul
and
brain
whence
cometh
my
help
let
me
sleep
among
the
shadows
of
the
mountains
when
i
die
in
the
murmur
of
the
pines
and
sliding
streams
where
the
long
day
loiters
by
like
a
cloud
across
the
sky
and
the
night
is
musical
with
dreams
lay
me
down
within
a
canyon
of
the
mountains
far
away
in
a
valley
filled
with
dim
and
rosy
light
where
the
flashing
rivers
play
out
across
the
golden
day
and
a
noise
of
many
waters
brims
the
night
let
me
lie
where
glinting
rivers
ramble
down
the
slanted
glade
under
bending
alders
garrulous
and
cool
where
they
gather
in
the
shade
to
the
dazzling
sheer
cascade
where
they
plunge
and
sleep
within
the
pebbled
pool
all
the
wisdom
all
the
beauty
i
have
lived
for
unaware
came
upon
me
by
the
rote
of
highland
rills
i
have
seen
god
walking
there
in
the
solemn
soundless
air
when
the
morning
wakened
wonder
in
the
hills
i
am
what
the
mountains
made
me
of
their
green
and
gold
and
gray
of
the
dawnlight
and
the
moonlight
and
the
foam
mighty
mothers
far
away
ye
who
washed
my
soul
in
spray
i
am
coming
mother
mountains
coming
home
when
i
draw
my
dreams
about
me
when
i
leave
the
darkling
plain
where
my
soul
forgets
to
soar
and
learns
to
plod
i
shall
go
back
home
again
to
the
kingdoms
of
the
rain
to
the
blue
purlieus
of
heaven
nearer
god
where
the
rose
of
dawn
blooms
earlier
across
the
miles
of
mist
between
the
tides
of
sundown
and
moonrise
i
shall
keep
a
lover
tryst
with
the
gold
and
amethyst
with
the
stars
for
my
companions
in
the
skies
unity
where
the
long
valley
slopes
away
five
miles
across
the
dreaming
day
a
maple
sends
a
scarlet
prayer
into
the
still
autumnal
air
three
hickories
are
fanned
to
flame
beneath
the
breeze
and
one
great
crimson
oak
tree
fires
the
over
the
concord
spires
in
worship
mystically
sweet
the
rimy
asters
at
my
feet
and
spiring
gentian
bells
that
burn
blue
incense
in
an
azure
urn
breathe
softly
from
the
aspiring
sod
this
is
our
utmost
take
it
god
this
chant
of
green
this
prayer
of
blue
this
is
the
best
thy
clay
can
do
o
lonely
heart
and
widowed
brain
sick
with
philosophies
that
strain
body
from
spirit
flesh
from
soul
worship
with
asters
and
be
whole
live
simply
as
still
water
flows
till
soul
shall
border
brain
so
close
no
blade
of
wit
can
thrust
between
and
hearts
are
pure
as
grass
is
green
pray
with
the
maple
tree
and
trust
the
ancient
ritual
of
the
dust
vistas
as
i
walked
through
the
rumorous
streets
of
the
city
where
all
of
the
houses
were
friends
and
the
trees
were
all
lovers
of
her
the
spell
of
its
old
enchantment
was
woven
again
to
subdue
me
with
magic
of
flickering
shadows
blown
branches
and
leafy
stir
street
after
street
as
i
passed
lured
me
and
beckoned
me
onward
with
memories
frail
as
the
odor
of
lilac
adrift
on
the
air
at
the
end
of
each
vista
she
seemed
to
be
watching
and
waiting
with
leaf
shadows
over
her
gown
and
sunshine
gilding
her
hair
for
there
was
a
dream
that
the
kind
god
withheld
while
granting
us
many
but
surely
i
think
we
shall
come
sometime
at
the
end
she
and
i
to
the
heaven
he
keeps
for
all
tired
souls
the
quiet
suburban
gardens
where
he
himself
walks
in
the
evening
beneath
the
sky
and
watches
the
balancing
elm
trees
sway
in
the
early
starshine
when
high
in
their
murmurous
arches
the
night
breeze
ruffles
by
a
nun
one
glance
and
i
had
lost
her
in
the
riot
of
tangled
cries
she
trod
the
clamor
with
a
cloistral
quiet
deep
in
her
eyes
as
though
she
heard
the
muted
music
only
that
silence
makes
among
dim
mountain
summits
and
on
lonely
deserted
lakes
there
is
some
broken
song
her
heart
remembers
from
long
ago
some
love
lies
buried
deep
some
passion
embers
smothered
in
snow
far
voices
of
a
joy
that
sought
and
missed
her
fail
now
and
cease
and
this
has
given
the
deep
eyes
of
god
sister
their
dreadful
peace
love
among
the
clover
if
you
dare
she
said
and
oh
her
breath
was
clover
nodded
over
her
her
lips
were
clover
red
blackbirds
fluted
down
the
wind
the
bobolinks
were
mad
with
joy
the
wind
was
playing
in
her
hair
and
if
you
dare
she
said
clover
billowed
down
the
wind
far
across
the
happy
fields
clover
on
the
breezy
hills
leaned
along
the
skies
and
all
the
nodding
clover
heads
and
little
clouds
with
silver
sails
and
all
the
heaven
dreamy
blue
were
mirrored
in
her
eyes
her
laughing
lips
were
when
long
ago
i
kissed
her
there
and
made
for
one
swift
moment
all
my
heaven
and
earth
complete
i
loved
among
the
roses
since
and
love
among
the
lilies
now
but
love
among
the
clover
her
breath
was
o
wise
boy
and
girl
who
played
among
the
clover
bloom
i
think
i
was
far
wiser
then
than
now
i
dare
to
be
for
i
have
lost
that
eden
now
i
can
not
find
my
eden
now
and
even
should
i
find
it
now
i
thrown
away
the
key
certain
american
poets
they
cowered
inert
before
the
study
fire
while
mighty
winds
were
ranging
wide
and
free
urging
their
torpid
fancies
to
aspire
with
euhoe
bacchus
have
a
cup
of
tea
they
tripped
demure
from
church
to
shunning
the
snare
of
farthingales
and
curls
woman

thought
half
angel
and
half
doll
the

a
for

quaffing
pierian

toiled

prove
their

serenely
their

the
singer
quest
i
been
wandering
listening
for
a
song
dreaming
of
a
melody
all
my
life
long
the
lilting
tune
that
god
sang
to
rock
the
tides
asleep
and
crooned
above
the
cradled
stars
before
they
learned
to
creep
o
there
was
laughter
in
it
and
many
a
merry
chime
before
he
had
turned
moralist
grown
old
before
his
time
and
he
was
happy
trolling
out
his
great
tune
before
he
slung
the
little
earth
beneath
the
sun
and
moon
but
i
know
that
somewhere
that
song
is
rolling
on
like
flutes
along
the
midnight
like
trumpets
in
the
dawn
it
throbs
across
the
sunset
and
stirs
the
poplar
tree
and
rumbles
in
the
long
low
thunder
of
the
sea
sang
me
one
note
and
taught
me
two
a
child
has
told
me
three
notes
and
soon
i
know
it
through
and
when
i
stand
before
the
throne
i
hum
it
low
and
sly
watching
for
a
great
light
of
welcome
in
his
eye
put
a
white
raiment
on
him
and
a
harp
into
his
hand
and
golden
sandals
on
his
feet
and
tell
the
saints
to
stand
a
little
farther
off
unless
they
wish
to
hear
the
truth
for
this
blessed
lucky
sinner
is
going
to
sing
about
my
youth
dead
magdalen
cover
her
over
with
pallid
white
roses
her
who
had
none
but
red
roses
to
wear
all
that
her
last
grim
lover
bestows
is
virginal
white
for
her
bosom
and
hair
cover
the
folds
of
the
glimmering
sheet
clear
from
her
eyelids
weary
and
sweet
down
to
her
nevermore
wayward
feet
then
they
may
find
her
fair
lovingly
tenderly
let
us
array
her
fair
as
a
bride
for
the
way
she
must
go
leaving
no
lingering
stain
to
betray
her
letting
them
see
we
have
sullied
her
so
over
the
curve
of
the
fair
young
breast
leave
we
this
maidenly
lily
to
rest
white
as
the
snow
in
its
nest
now
they
will
never
know
the
adventurer
he
came
not
in
the
red
dawn
nor
in
the
blaze
of
noon
and
all
the
long
bright
highway
lay
lonely
to
the
moon
and
nevermore
we
know
now
will
he
come
wandering
down
the
breezy
hollows
of
the
hills
that
gird
the
quiet
town
for
he
has
heard
a
voice
cry
a
ahoy
far
up
the
wind
and
followed
unquestioning
after
joy
but
we
are
long
forgetting
the
quiet
way
he
went
with
looks
of
love
and
gentle
scorn
so
sweetly
subtly
blent
we
can
not
cease
to
wonder
we
who
have
loved
him
how
he
fares
along
the
windy
ways
his
feet
must
travel
now
but
we
must
draw
the
curtain
and
fasten
bolts
and
bars
and
talk
here
in
the
firelight
of
him
beneath
the
stars
the
goldfinch
down
from
the
sky
on
a
sudden
he
drops
into
the
mullein
and
juniper
tops
flushed
from
his
bath
in
the
midsummer
shine
flooding
the
meadowland
drunk
with
the
wine
spilled
from
the
urns
of
the
blue
like
a
bold
in
his
sable
and
gold
lightly
he
sways
on
the
pendulous
stem
vividly
restless
a
fluttering
gem
then
with
a
flash
of
bewildering
wings
dazzles
away
up
and
down
and
he
sings
clear
as
a
bell
at
each
dip
as
he
flies
bounding
along
on
the
wave
of
the
skies
sunlight
and
laughter
a
winged
desire
motion
and
melody
married
to
fire
lighter
than
borne
on
the
wind
frailer
than
violets
how
shall
we
find
words
that
will
match
him
discover
a
name
meet
for
this
marvel
this
lyrical
flame
how
shall
we
fashion
a
rhythm
to
wing
with
him
find
us
a
wonderful
music
to
sing
with
him
fine
as
his
rapture
is
free
as
the
rollicking
song
that
the
harlequin
drops
in
his
frolicking
dance
through
the
summer
sky
singing
so
merrily
high
in
the
burning
blue
winging
so
airily
mount
vernon
new
orioles
wings
in
a
blur
of
gold
high
in
the
elm
trees
looping
like
tawny
flame
through
the
green
shadows
now
at
an
airy
height
pausing
a
heart
beat
quite
at
the
twig

pendulous
bending
golden
against
the

in
an
azure
cup
golden

bubbling
out
of

and

of

by
a
mountain
stream
where
the
rivulet
swept
by
a
sycamore
root
with
a
turbulent
voice
and
a
hurrying
foot
i
bent
by
the
water
and
spoke
in
my
dream
to
the
wavering
restless
unlingering
stream
oh
turbulent
rivulet
hastening
past
for
what
wonderful
goal
do
you
hope
at
the
last
that
never
you
pause
in
the
shimmering
green
of
the
undulant
shade
where
the
sycamores
lean
or
rest
in
the
cool
dripping
halls
hidden
under
the
veils
of
your
musical
falls
or
loiter
at
peace
by
the
tremulous
fern
white
wandering
waters
that
never
return
and
i
dreamed
by
the
rivulet
wavering
side
that
a
myriad
ripple
of
voices
replied
aloft
on
the
mountain
afar
on
the
steep
a
voice
that
we
knew
cried
aloud
in
our
sleep
hasten
ye
down
to
the
vale
and
to
me
your
begetter
destroyer
preserver
the
sea
we
must
carry
our
feebleness
down
to
the
strong
we
must
mingle
us
deep
in
the
whole
and
ere
long
all
the
numberless
host
of
the
heaven
shall
ride
with
the
pale
lady
moon
on
our
slumbering
tide
the
voices
swept
out
and
away
through
the
door
of
the
canyon
and
on
to
the
infinite
shore
oh
vast
in
thy
destiny
slender
of
span
wild
rivulet
how
thou
art
like
to
a
man
brook
april
bliss
there
a
murmur
in
the
patient
forest
alleys
there
an
elfin
echo
whispering
through
the
trees
lonely
pipes
are
lifted
softly
in
the
valleys
all
the
air
is
filled
with
waking
melodies
from
the
crucibles
of
erebus
and
endor
flame
of
emerald
has
fallen
by
the
rills
and
it
flashes
up
the
slope
and
sits
in
splendor
in
the
glory
of
the
beauty
of
the
hills
now
my
heart
will
yearn
again
to
voice
its
wonder
and
my
song
must
sing
again
between
the
words
with
a
mutter
of
unutterable
thunder
and
a
twitter
of
inimitable
birds
a

paul
there
a
mouldering
mountain
chapel
gazing
out
across
the
sea
from
beneath
the
lisping
shelter
of
a
eucalyptus
tree
that
has
drawn
the
ancient
silence
from
the
mountain
heart
and
fills
and
subdues
a
fevered
spirit
with
the
quiet
of
the
hills
for
silvery
in
the
morning
the
chimes
go
dropping
down
across
the
vales
of
purple
mist
that
gird
the
island
town
and
golden
in
the
evening
the
vesper
bells
again
call
back
the
weary
fishing
folk
along
the
leafy
lane
i
like
to
be
the
father
priest
and
call
the
folk
to
prayer
up
through
the
winding
dewy
ways
that
climb
the
morning
air
and
send
them
down
at
with
all
the
silent
sky
of
early
starshine
teaching
them
far
deeper
truth
than
i
like
to
lie
at
rest
there
beneath
a
mossy
stone
above
the
crooning
sea
low
distant

by
the
lisping

you

burn
out
and

will
be

known
from

which
was
the
firefly
which
the
star
wanderlust
the
birds
were
beating
north
again
with
faint
and
starry
cries
along
their
ancient
highway
that
spans
the
midnight
skies
and
out
across
the
rush
of
wings
my
heart
went
crying
too
straight
for
the
morning
windy
walls
and
lakes
of
misted
blue
they
gave
me
place
among
them
for
well
they
understood
the
magic
wine
of
april
working
madness
in
my
blood
and
we
were
kin
in
thought
and
dream
as
league
by
league
together
we
kept
that
pace
of
straining
wings
across
the
starry
weather
the
dim
blue
tides
of
fundy
green
slopes
of
labrador
slid
under
us
our
course
was
set
for
earth
remotest
shore
but
tingling
through
the
ether
and
searching
star
by
star
a
lonely
voice
went
crying
that
drew
me
down
from
far
farewell
farewell
my
brothers
i
see
you
far
away
go
drifting
down
the
sunset
across
the
last
green
bay
but
i
have
found
the
haven
of
this
lonely
heart
and
wild
my
falconer
has
called
me
i
am
prisoned
by
a
child
the
ideal
serenely
from
her
mountain
height
sublime
she
mocks
my
hopeless
labor
as
i
creep
each
day
a
day
strength
farther
from
the
deep
and
nearer
to
her
side
for
which
i
climb
so
may
she
mock
when
for
the
sad
last
time
i
fall
my
face
still
upward
upon
sleep
with
faithful
hands
still
yearning
up
the
steep
in
patient
and
pathetic
pantomime
i
am
content
o
ancient
child
of
love
and
longing
pity
not
our
wars
of
flesh
and
keep
thee
undefiled
by
all
our
strife
that
only
breaks
and
mars
but
let
us
see
from
far
thy
footing
wild
and
wayward
still
against
the
eternal
stars
the
first
christian
a
little
wandering
wind
went
up
the
hill
it
had
a
lonely
voice
as
though
it
knew
what
it
should
find
before
it
came
to
where
the
broken
body
of
him
that
had
been
christ
hung
in
the
ruddy
glow
a
bowshot
down
the
bleak
hill
the
soldiery
had
piled
a
fire
and
when
the
searching
wind
came
stronger
from
the
distant
sea
and
dashed
the
shadows
and
the
gleam
together
songs
of
battle
and
lust
were
blown
along
the
slope
mingled
with
clash
of
swords
on
cuisse
and
shield
but
of
the
women
sitting
by
the
cross
even
she
whose
life
had
been
as
gravely
sweet
and
sheltered
as
a
lily
did
not
flinch
her
face
was
buried
in
her
shrouding
cloak
and
she
who
knew
too
sorrowfully
well
the
cruelty
and
bitterness
of
life
heard
not
she
sat
erect
her
shadowy
hair
blown
back
along
the
darkness
and
her
eyes
that
searched
the
distant
spaces
of
the
night
splendid
and
glowing
with
an
inward
joy
and
at
the
darkest
hour
came
three
or
four
from
round
the
fire
and
would
have
driven
them
thence
but
one
who
knew
them
gazing
in
their
eyes
said
nay
it
is
his
mother
and
his
love
the
scarlet
magdalena
let
them
be
so
in
the
gloom
beside
that
glimmering
cross
beneath
the
broken
body
of
him
they
loved
they
wept
and
watched
the
lily
and
the
rose
at
last
the
deep
low
voice
of
magdalen
toned
like
a
distant
bell
broke
on
the
hush
we
are
so
weak
what
can
poor
women
do
so
pitifully
frail
god
pity
us
how
he
did
pity
us
he
understood
out
of
his
own
great
strength
he
understood
how
it
might
feel
to
be
so
very
weak
to
be
a
tender
lily
of
the
field
to
be
a
lamb
lost
in
the
windy
hills
far
from
the
fold
and
from
the
shepherd
voice
to
be
a
child
with
no
strength
only
love
and
ah
he
knew
if
ever
a
man
can
know
what
is
to
be
a
woman
and
to
live
strive
how
she
may
to
and
overcome
tied
to
this
too
frail
body
of
too
fair
earth
oh
had
i
been
a
man
to
shield
him
then
in
his
great
need
with
loving
strong
right
arm
one
of
the
twelve
ha
of
that
noble
twelve
that
ran
away
and
two
made
mock
of
him
or
else
betrayed
him
ere
they
ran
ah
no
and
yet
a
man
strength
with
a
woman
love
that
might
have
served
him
somewhat
ere
the
end
then
with
a
weary
voice
the
mother
said
what
can
we
do
but
only
watch
and
weep
sit
with
weak
hands
and
watch
while
strong
men
rend
and
break
and
ruin
bringing
all
to
nought
the
beauty
we
have
nearly
died
to
make
it
is
not
true
to
say
that
he
was
strong
he
did
not
claim
the
kingdom
that
was
his
he
did
not
even
seek
for
wealth
and
power
he
did
not
win
a
woman
love
and
get
strong
children
to
live
after
him
and
all
that
strong
men
strive
for
he
passed
heedless
by
because
that
he
was
weak
i
loved
him
so
for
that
and
for
his
soft
and
gentle
ways
the
tender
patient
calling
of
his
voice
and
that
dear
trick
of
smiling
with
his
eyes
ah
no
i
have
had
dreams
a
mother
dreams
but
now
i
can
not
dream
them
any
more
i
sorrowed
little
as
the
happy
days
sped
by
and
by
that
still
the
lad
who
lay
at
first
beside
me
in
the
stall
the
cattle
stall
outside
jerusalem
found
no
great
throne
to
dazzle
his
mother
eye
he
was
so
good
a
workman
axe
and
saw
did
surely
suit
him
better
than
a
sword
i
was
content
if
only
he
would
wed
some
village
girl
of
little
nazareth
and
get
me
children
with
his
own
slow
smile
deep
thoughtful
eyes
and
golden
kingly
brow
it
seems
but
yesterday
he
played
among
the
shavings
strewn
on
joseph
floor
the
sunlight
of
the
morning
slanted
through
the
window
was
in
springtime
and
across
the
bench
where
joseph
sat
and
then
it
lay
in
golden
glory
on
the
boy
bright
hair
and
on
the
shavings
that
were
golden
too
i
saw
him
through
the
open
door
i
thought
little
king
has
found
his
golden
crown
but
unto
joseph
i
said
nought
at
all
but
now
ah
me
he
won
no
woman
love
nor
loved
one
either
as
most
men
call
love
and
so
he
had
no
child
and
he
is
gone
and
i
am
left
without
him
and
alone
so
by
her
son
pale
broken
body
mourned
the
mother
dreaming
on
departed
days
and
as
with
one
who
looks
into
the
west
watching
the
embers
of
the
outburned
day
crumble
and
cool
and
slowly
droop
and
fade
and
will
not
take
the
darkling
eastward
path
where
lies
his
way
until
the
last
faint
glow
has
left
the
sky
and
the
early
stars
shine
forth
so
did
her
dream
cling
to
the
ruined
past
and
all
the
joy
they
had
in
nazareth
before
the
years
of
doubt
and
trouble
came
then
while
loud
laughter
sounded
up
the
hill
where
yet
that
ribald
crew
sang
the
wine
she
bowed
her
head
above
her
cradling
arms
and
softly
sang
as
to
herself
the
songs
of
israel
that
once
had
served
her
well
to
soothe
the
wakeful
child
but
magdalen
arose
upon
her
feet
and
tossed
her
cloak
back
from
the
midnight
of
her
hair
and
lifted
up
her
eyes
into
the
dark
as
though
beyond
this
circle
of
all
our
woe
to
read
a
hidden
meaning
in
the
stars
aye
it
is
dark
she
said
the
night
comes
on
he
was
the
sunshine
of
our
little
day
the
clouds
unsettled
softly
and
we
saw
ladders
of
glory
climbing
into
light
unspeakable
with
dazzling
interchange
of
majesties
and
powers
but
suddenly
the
tides
of
darkness
whelm
us
round
again
and
this
drear
dwindled
earth
becomes
once
more
what
it
has
ever
been
a
core
of
shade
and
steaming
vapor
spinning
in
the
dark
a
deeper
clot
of
blackness
in
the
void
the
night
comes
on
is
hard
to
pierce
the
dark
and
if
to
me
who
loved
him
whom
he
loved
though
well
thou
sayest
as
most
men
call
love
far
harder
will
it
be
for
those
who
hold
in
memory
no
gesture
of
his
hand
no
haunting
echo
of
his
patient
voice
nor
that
dear
trick
of
smiling
with
his
eyes
o
ceaseless
tramp
of
armies
down
the
years
o
maddened
cries
of
and
of
mary
while
the
crying
screams
the
hurtling
death
thou
gentle
shepherd
of
the
quiet
fold
mild
man
of
sorrows
hast
thou
done
this
thing
who
camest
not
to
bring
peace
but
a
sword
ah
no
not
thou
but
only
our
childishness
the
pitifully
childish
heart
of
man
that
can
not
learn
and
know
beyond
a
little
the
priests
and
captains
and
the
little
kings
will
tear
each
other
at
the
throat
and
cry
said
he
lived
he
swear
it
or
thou
diest
but
these
shall
pass
and
perish
in
the
dark
while
the
lorn
strays
and
outcasts
of
the
world
the
souls
whose
pain
has
seared
their
pride
to
dust
and
burned
a
way
for
love
to
enter
in
these
only
know
his
meaning
and
shall
live
so
is
it
as
with
one
whose
feet
have
trod
the
valley
of
the
shadow
who
has
seen
his
dearest
lowered
into
endless
night
all
music
holds
for
him
a
deeper
strain
of
nobler
meaning
and
the
flush
of
dawn
high
wind
at
noonday
crumbling
sunset
gold
and
the
dear
pathetic
look
of
children
eyes
all
beauty
pierces
closer
to
his
heart
yea
thou
thyself
pale
youth
upon
the
cross
the
godlike
strength
of
thee
was
rooted
deep
in
human
weakness
even
she
who
bore
thee
seeing
the
man
too
nearly
missed
the
god
erring
as
fits
the
mother
some
will
say
in
coming
years
i
feel
it
in
my
heart
that
thou
didst
face
thy
death
a
conscious
god
knowing
almighty
hands
were
stretched
to
snatch
and
lift
thee
from
the
greedy
clutching
grave
falsely
forgetting
dark
gethsemane
not
knowing
as
i
know
what
doubt
assailed
thy
human
heart
until
the
latest
breath
ah
what
a
trumpery
death
what
mockery
and
mere
theatric
mimicry
of
pain
if
thou
didst
surely
know
thou
couldst
not
die
thou
didst
not
know
and
whether
even
now
thy
straying
ghost
like
some
great
moth
of
night
blown
seaward
through
the
shadow
flies
and
drifts
along
dim
coasts
and
headlands
of
the
dark
a
homeless
wanderer
up
and
down
the
void
or
whether
indeed
thou
art
enthroned
above
in
light
and
life
i
know
not
this
i
know
that
in
the
moment
of
sheer
certainty
my
soul
will
die
no
on
thy
spirit
lay
all
the
dark
weight
and
mystery
of
pain
and
all
our
human
doubt
and
flickering
hope
deathless
despairs
and
treasuries
of
tears
gropings
of
spirit
blindfold
by
the
flesh
and
grapplings
with
the
fiend
else
were
thy
death
less
like
a
god
than
even
mine
may
be
thou
broken
mother
who
canst
see
in
him
only
the
quiet
man
the
needful
child
and
most
of
all
the
babe
of
bethlehem
let
it
suffice
thee
thy
reward
is
great
who
loveth
god
that
never
hath
loved
man
who
knoweth
man
but
cometh
to
know
god
thou
sacred
sorrowing
mother
canst
thou
learn
thou
who
hast
gone
so
softly
in
god
sight
of
me
the
scarlet
woman
of
old
days
come
let
us
talk
together
thou
and
i
apart
we
see
him
darkly
through
a
glass
together
we
shall
surely
see
aright
bring
thou
thine
innocence
thy
stainless
soul
and
i
will
bring
deep
lore
of
suffering
my
wisdom
of
defeat
and
pain
for
out
of
these
may
come
believe
it
thou
sanctities
not
like
thine
but
fit
to
bear
the
bitter
storms
and
whirlwinds
of
this
world
aye
out
of
evil
often
springeth
good
and
sweetest
honey
from
the
lion
mouth
and
that
he
knew
that
very
thing
he
meant
when
he
withdrew
me
from
the
pits
of
shame
is
i
who
see
god
shining
through
the
man
i
see
the
deity
the
godlike
strength
in
his
supreme
capacity
for
pain
nor
have
i
known
the
cruel
love
of
men
these
many
years
to
err
when
now
i
say
this
man
loved
not
like
men
but
like
a
god
thou
broken
mother
weep
not
for
the
child
mourn
not
the
man
acclaim
the
risen
christ
she
turned
and
touched
the
other
lovingly
then
stooped
and
peered
into
her
darkened
face
the
mother
slept
forspent
and
overborne
by
weariness
and
woe
too
great
to
bear
she
gently
smiled
so
it
is
best
she
said
tall
and
elate
she
stood
her
shadowy
hair
blown
back
along
the
darkness
and
her
eyes
that
searched
the
distant
spaces
of
the
night
splendid
and
glowing
with
an
inward
joy
and
over
that
dark
hill
of
tragedy
and
triumph
victory
and
dull
despair
over
the
sleeping
roman
soldiery
over
the
three
stark
crosses
and
the
two
who
loved
him
most
the
lily
and
the
rose
shone
still
and
clear
the
great
compassionate
stars
