i
follow
the
flight
of
the
seagulls
gleaming
like
snow
when
their
wings
catch
the
sunshine
while
from
the
adjacent
is
wafted
music
half
drowned
in
a
babel
of
voices
fitting
the
mode
of
this
temple
of
follies
far
though
the
mountains
their
influence
ever
changeful
in
temper
from
sombre
to
smiling
constant
in
wileful
and
mystic
allurement
rouses
unrest
and
a
strange
fascination
limpid
and
blue
are
the
waters
of
leman
clear
in
the
deepness
translucent
and
shining
blue
as
the
ether
ineffable
azure
bright
in
the
glow
of
the
midsummer
sunshine
cleaving
the
air
with
their
palpitant
pinions
wheeling
and
drifting
the
beautiful
seagulls
fly
with
the
grace
of
unconscious
perfection
crying
exultant
and
wild
in
a
chorus
are
you
not
fit
for
the
realm
of
immortals
to
float
on
the
winds
of
the
gardens
elysian
or
must
you
hover
a
little
while
longer
wandering
souls
in
a
state
of
probation
uplifted
beyond
our
defilement
removed
from
the
land
of
the
blessed
far
in
the
distance
beyond
the
blue
water
rises
the
hoary
old
father
of
mountains
rugged
and
scarred
with
antiquity
furrows
crowned
with
the
snows
of
a
million
winters
low
in
the
shade
of
his
ponderous
presence
dappling
the
slopes
are
the
homesteads
of
peasants
each
with
its
cloud
of
blue
vapour
ascending
and
sweetly
the
bells
across
the
green
pastures
answer
each
other
with
voices
persistent
telling
the
herdsman
the
tale
of
his
charges
grim
is
the
smile
of
the
mountain
for
toilers
below
in
the
slumbering
valley
grim
is
the
glance
with
a
touch
of
derision
seeming
to
say
to
his
towering
brothers
catogne
and
the
heights
of
the
midi
iguanodon
mastodon
man
in
their
passing
serve
but
as
signs
on
the
path
of
the
ages
softly
the
plash
of
the
waters
of
leman
sounds
from
the
stones
at
its
margin
gently
the
zephyrs
play
over
its
surface
making
it
glitter
with
myriads
of
sparklets
swiftly
the
barques
trim
their
sails
in
the
sunshine
sails
high
and
slender
that
swell
to
the
breezes
white
as
the
snow
on
the
breast
of
the
jungfrau
mirrored
in
whiteness
upon
the
blue
water
as
i
sat
watching
the
lake
and
the
mountains
slowly
a
haze
like
a
curtain
of
muslin
flimsy
and
fine
like
a
texture
of
cobweb
drifted
and
rose
till
it
shut
out
the
bases
and
bulk
of
the
mountains
across
the
still
water
whilst
high
above
it
the
crests
and
sierras
stood
out
as
castles
and
walls
of
enchantment
raised
in
the
air
like
king
solomon
city
held
up
aloft
by
invisible
genii
then
in
the
faintly
drawn
lines
of
escarpment
battlements
pinnacles
turrets
and
bastions
sprang
into
being
and
fancy
untrammelled
pictured
a
palace
with
walls
and
a
fortress
beleaguered
and
stormed
by
a
shadowy
army
massed
under
pennons
seen
dim
through
the
vapour
over
the
drawbridge
a
desperate
sortie
made
by
the
knights
of
the
castle
invested
brings
the
foes
quickly
in
conflict
together
plumes
white
and
restless
like
foam
on
the
breakers
drift
to
and
fro
with
the
tide
of
the
battle
falchions
and
maces
and
curtaxes
gleaming
a
moment
aloft
strike
sparks
in
descending
on
corslet
and
casque
and
dinted
escutcheon
whilst
out
of
the
contest
with
stumbling
footsteps
the
wounded
are
led
sore
stricken
and
helpless
ladies
in
sarcenet
arabesque
broidered
with
blossoms
that
climb
fantastic
in
colour
stiff
flowers
of
blazonry
formal
convention
that
rise
from
the
hem
to
the
throat
in
profusion
where
carcanets
flash
on
bosoms
unquiet
look
from
their
casements
with
eyes
full
of
wonder
down
on
the
conflict
that
rages
below
them
fierce
in
the
shock
and
the
heat
of
encounter
hearing
the
and
clashing
of
weapons
winding
of
horns
and
the
groans
of
the
dying
till
all
was
lost
in
the
thickening
curtain
veiled
by
the
mist
were
my
golden
romances
once
when
a
snowstorm
swept
over
lake
leman
filling
the
distance
with
wildly
tossed
snowflakes
i
pictured
a
scene
in
the
heart
of
the
mountains
hidden
in
shadows
unknown
to
the
climber
out
of
the
range
of
humanity
footsteps
there
is
the
cave
where
the
slumbering
ice
god
hides
from
the
gaze
of
the
wandering
stranger
shut
in
the
depths
of
the
mountain
recesses
rent
long
ago
by
the
force
of
upheavals
in
the
wild
turmoil
and
labour
of
earthquake
there
sits
the
god
of
the
cold
everlasting
guarding
the
spirits
of
men
who
have
perished
in
their
endeavours
to
master
the
secrets
of
paths
that
have
never
by
footsteps
been
trodden
in
the
ice
temple
his
figure
majestic
looms
from
a
throne
that
through
aeons
uncounted
has
stood
in
the
gloom
and
the
silence
eternal
weird
is
the
throng
of
the
spirits
in
thraldom
silent
they
steal
from
their
icy
sepulture
figures
unchanged
and
unchanging
by
violent
death
swift
ruthless
and
lonely
sentenced
to
wander
for
ever
in
darkness
pent
in
the
masterful
ice
god
dominion
primitive
hunters
with
arrows
whose
limited
minds
ignored
the
distinction
engendered
by
knowledge
of
good
and
of
evil
acting
by
impulse
and
guided
by
instinct
living
in
caves
like
the
bears
and
the
foxes
facing
with
cunning
and
courage
their
quarry
guarding
their
women
and
feeding
their
children
almost
as
fierce
as
the
creatures
they
hunted
men
who
came
later
throughout
the
long
ages
wandering
fugitives
driven
by
fortune
far
from
their
homes
to
the
wild
desolation
slaves
of
illusion
that
lures
to
destruction
some
with
a
love
for
adventure
and
daring
some
to
escape
from
the
ills
that
pursued
them
some
in
response
to
the
strong
fascination
that
calls
from
the
heights
of
the
untrodden
mountains
all
destined
by
fate
that
watches
unceasing
to
die
in
the
darkness
forgotten
for
ever
pent
in
the
ice
god
immutable
kingdom
wafted
by
breezes
my
felucca
slipped
through
the
blueness
to
where
the
grim
stronghold
of
chillon
keeps
ever
in
grateful
remembrance
the
patriot
bonivard
champion
of
freedom
the
pillar
of
pain
where
writhing
in
torment
the
captives
were
scourged
at
cruelty
bidding
is
still
to
be
seen
an
eloquent
witness
tenantless
now
is
the
cavernous
dungeon
where
wretches
awaited
through
darkness
unending
the
dawn
of
their
last
and
dreaded
stripped
of
its
horrors
the
chamber
of
torture
echoes
no
more
to
the
shrieks
of
its
victims
and
death
grim
abode
where
agony
ended
is
free
from
the
crimes
that
redden
its
records
there
by
the
column
of
stone
in
the
dungeon
where
bonivard
lay
to
pine
through
the
seasons
of
six
weary
years
i
mused
on
his
story
undaunted
by
death
shadow
unconquered
though
insolent
tyranny
triumphed
chilled
in
the
summer
and
frozen
in
winter
famished
neglected
and
loaded
with
fetters
yet
borne
up
within
by
courage
unflinching
supported
by
faith
when
hope
had
departed
scorning
to
murmur
he
waited
with
patience
morning
faint
light
through
the
narrow
embrasure
the
wandering
cry
of
a
in
freedom
heightened
the
gloom
of
his
roughly
hewn
prison
making
a
summons
to
death
a
deliverance
night
fell
about
him
in
stygian
darkness
while
the
faint
lap
of
the
waters
of
leman
beating
the
ramparts
with
madding
persistence
whispered
despair
in
the
still
isolation
what
were
his
thoughts
when
the
vault
of
his
prison
rang
with
glad
cries
in
the
glare
of
the
torches
breaking
the
silence
dispelling
the
shadows
that
darkened
his
life
and
threatened
his
reason
what
were
his
thoughts
at
the
moment
of
freedom
when
round
him
a
tempest
of
passion
was
raging
an
unloosened
storm
of
passionate
feeling
when
men
incoherent
and
hoarse
from
the
conflict
fought
for
the
honour
of
breaking
his
fetters
leaving
him
breathless
with
hearty
embraces
weak
and
unmanned
in
the
sudden
revulsion
carried
away
by
the
flood
of
emotion
with
something
unknown
that
stifled
expression
that
silenced
his
voice
and
heaved
in
his
bosom
strong
is
the
spell
of
the
mountains
ruddy
with
gold
in
the
glory
of
sunrise
purple
and
silver
and
blue
in
the
daytime
tinged
by
the
amethyst
splendours
of
sunset
gloomy
majestic
and
dark
in
the
twilight
mystic
by
moonlight
ethereal
airy
changeful
and
fickle
in
hues
as
the
opal
under
the
mutable
lights
and
the
shadows
ever
alluring
with
subtle
attraction
far
far
away
are
the
waters
of
leman
whence
i
have
fled
at
the
call
of
the
mountains
here
in
the
valley
where
rushes
a
torrent
constant
and
cold
be
it
summer
or
winter
a
village
lies
hid
and
hither
the
climbers
strangely
alike
in
their
eager
impatience
wearing
the
look
of
enwrapped
expectation
pause
ere
they
start
on
their
perilous
journey
hemming
me
round
the
implacable
mountains
shut
out
the
world
and
confine
me
in
durance
bending
my
soul
to
the
yoke
of
their
bondage
dwarfing
my
self
and
my
little
emotions
waking
desire
to
escape
limitations
and
barriers
imposed
by
narrow
horizons
rugged
majestic
they
tower
above
me
as
lonely
and
pensive
i
gaze
in
the
torrent
wondering
now
at
the
summons
insistent
no
longer
in
dreams
and
rovings
of
fancy
but
weighted
with
impulse
defying
resistance
rousing
unrest
like
a
spirit
of
evil
so
as
i
linger
awhile
in
the
village
completely
i
know
each
day
brings
me
nearer
to
what
lies
beyond
in
the
regions
of
silence
now
it
is
over
the
lights
of
the
village
the
children
at
play
the
clink
from
the
smithy
the
gurgle
and
rush
of
the
hurrying
torrent
the
rattle
of
wheels
the
tinkle
of
cowbells
the
inn
open
window
whence
converse
in
fragments
floats
out
with
the
odours
of
beer
and
tobacco
all
welcome
me
back
with
familiar
voices
here
time
moves
onward
with
rhythmic
precision
breakfast
and
dinner
and
bed
for
the
darkness
with
sunday
to
part
one
week
from
another
spring
time
and
winter
the
snow
and
the
sunshine
and
sooner
or
later
a
cross
in
the
churchyard
time
lacks
proportion
away
in
the
mountains
what
is
a
day
or
an
hour
or
a
lifetime
gauged
by
the
ebb
and
the
flow
of
the
ages
shown
in
the
tidemarks
on
crags
prehistoric
if
as
men
say
time
is
measured
by
heartbeats
i
wandered
through
years
of
vivid
emotions
pelion
and
ossa
by
arrogant
titans
profanely
uplifted
to
challenge
olympus
repeated
themselves
in
the
blueness
above
me
sunsets
and
dawns
such
as
glowed
on
the
marshes
silurian
haunts
of
the
early
creation
long
ere
the
age
of
humanity
advent
gleamed
through
the
vapours
and
red
exhalations
rising
from
bottomless
pits
to
encolour
weirdly
the
matrix
volcanic
primeval
riven
and
torn
in
the
of
cosmos
slippery
ledges
uneven
and
narrow
through
rarefied
air
that
maddens
the
pulses
treacherous
footpaths
inviting
destruction
where
fear
in
the
heart
disorders
the
senses
vertiginate
chasms
abysmal
terrific
unfathomed
and
sheer
with
never
a
foothold
compelling
the
gaze
with
cold
fascination
stretches
of
billowy
acres
of
whiteness
dimming
the
eyes
with
their
endless
expanses
ridges
upstanding
in
ice
walls
cemented
by
glacial
pressure
of
masses
caverns
with
ice
shapes
translucent
columns
and
altars
and
figures
fantastic
imagined
in
dreams
or
pictured
in
fever
softly
illumed
by
the
moonlight
reflection
there
is
the
haunt
of
the
evil
ice
maidens
the
servants
of
death
who
lure
with
their
beauty
who
bathe
in
the
stream
of
the
glacier
water
the
glacial
water
that
flows
through
the
caverns
silent
and
deep
as
the
river
of
lethe
these
memories
hold
me
i
live
in
a
fever
the
air
that
i
breathe
the
influence
round
me
are
charged
with
a
strange
and
volatile
essence
that
throbs
in
my
veins
and
quickens
my
breathing
held
by
the
mountains
i
languish
in
bondage
under
the
masterful
sway
of
their
presence
restless
though
weary
i
dream
of
their
perils
slipping
down
chasms
with
death
at
the
bottom
or
over
the
desolate
ice
fields
i
wander
hopeless
forgotten
and
lost
in
the
snowdrifts
wandering
ever
past
hope
of
redemption
sometimes
i
swing
with
a
pendulum
measure
fitfully
swayed
by
the
wind
a
chasm
that
gapes
far
below
relentless
and
cruel
conscious
of
all
in
the
terrible
moments
that
pass
till
i
drop
to
the
doom
that
is
waiting
far
in
the
depths
of
the
yawning
crevasses
and
wake
at
the
instant
supreme
of
destruction
at
dawn
i
fly
from
the
village
back
to
the
peace
of
the
waters
of
leman
gone
gone
at
last
is
the
morbid
obsession
gone
to
the
shade
in
the
regions
of
limbo
far
far
away
the
waters
of
leman
mistily
outlined
and
faint
in
the
distance
threatening
no
longer
the
mountains
lazily
whisper
of
rest
and
contentment
softly
the
plash
of
the
glittering
fountain
falls
on
the
night
with
the
scent
of
mimosa
mingled
with
polyglot
phrases
and
laughter
marking
the
pause
a
waltz
and
mazurka
soft
are
the
lamps
in
the
kursaal
rotunda
lighting
discreetly
the
hall
of
lost
footsteps
whose
gleaming
mosaics
are
painted
with
garlands
blossoms
exotic
luxuriant
languid
red
as
the
souls
of
the
people
about
them
hinting
at
passions
through
crimson
and
purple
fitting
the
vogue
of
this
temple
of
pleasure
on
a
divan
in
the
hall
where
the
idlers
promenade
slowly
in
converse
together
i
sit
all
alone
in
calm
contemplation
hearing
the
orchestra
faint
in
the
distance
and
the
croupier
voice
from
his
chamber
seductive
crying
in
stale
iteration
summons
and
challenge
across
the
green
table
old
gamesters
who
prowl
round
the
players
seeking
a
pigeon
to
pluck
at
their
leisure
barons
with
blurred
reputations
smirking
at
and
his
girls
from
chicago
swaggering
captains
at
best
detrimental
a
youth
just
come
to
a
fortune
trying
in
vain
to
conceal
his
amazement
couples
awaiting
the
absolute
fiat
now
in
pursuit
of
a
flying
illusion
hebrews
from
frankfort
and
bankers
from
paris
chatting
to
ladies
resplendent
in
diamonds
a
burgess
of
london
whose
wife
says
disgraceful
but
lingers
to
study
parisian
fashions
gamblers
inveterate
bent
to
a
system
silent
unheeding
absorbed
in
their
figures
young
fellows
and
careless
come
for
the
dance
and
the
fun
of
flirtation
and
merry
unconsciously
breathing
the
poisonous
air
of
sepulchres
whited
perdita
watchful
and
guardedly
smiling
trying
to
lessen
the
distance
between
us
wafts
me
a
sign
with
a
spray
of
verbena
is
she
an
angel
a
beast
or
a
demon
or
spirit
incarnate
that
onward
is
passing
to
higher
avatars
by
long
transmigration
ah
how
it
warms
one
this
human
deflection
this
touch
with
familiar
follies
and
foibles
after
the
limitless
space
of
the
aeons
out
of
the
measure
of
time
as
we
know
it
far
in
the
distant
and
echoless
ages
austere
and
untouched
by
our
passing
emotions
where
i
have
wandered
in
lonely
remoteness
under
the
passionless
spell
of
the
mountains
cold
and
relentless
eternally
lasting
silent
inscriptions
in
cryptical
cipher
unbroken
record
of
time
since
creation
whose
secret
is
hid
from
human
conception
how
small
are
the
things
humanity
prizes
the
feverish
joys
of
passion
and
pleasure
that
pass
like
a
dream
to
dusky
oblivion
how
short
is
man
life
compared
with
the
ages
that
frown
from
the
face
of
the
mystical
mountains
far
in
the
blue
the
waters
of
leman
the
old
manor
house
the
rusted
gates
whose
forgings
fine
enlace
a
gilded
coronet
now
dim
in
lustreless
decline
groaned
as
i
passed
the
lichened

on

stiff
with

then
through
the
drive
i
passed
with
ancient
oaks
on
either
hand
throwing
their
shadows
dark
and
vast
upon
the
bracken
at
their
feet
where
rabbits
peeped
in
fear
and
ran
from
the
rare
sound
of
living
man
for
here
no
more
the
sumptuous
train
displays
the
pomp
of
falconry
no
more
besprent
with
mire
and
rain
the
rides
in
nor
with
his
retinue
of
knights
some
great
man
at
the
house
alights
above
the
portico
of
the
great
silent
house
the
quarterings
tinctures
glow
blazoning
its
history
from
the
old
sieur
de
caulx
whose
heavy
norman
sword
helped
harold
overthrow
and
whose
long
line
of
sons
stretches
like
a
shadow
thrown
in
the
eventide
through
the
old
folio
where
illumined
pages
bravely
the
records
show
till
the
last
lonely
heir
was
carried
down
below
to
the
cold
marble
vaults
a
century
ago
a
gallery
the
hall
a
gallery
where
minstrels
played
and
with
their
lutes
sweet
music
made
while
from
the
weapons
on
the
wall
reflected
shone
the
lights
that
glowed
above
the
hospitable
board
when
each
successive
generous
lord
his
loyalty
or
grandeur
showed
kings
feasted
there
with
stately
dames
ambassadors
and
cardinals
who
cheered
with
wine
and
madrigals
fed
with
their
fancies
amorous
flames
and
at
some
great
eventful
scene
full
many
a
dance
the
chamber
graced
pavanes
and
sarabands
were
paced
and
minuets
when
anne
was
queen
my
footsteps
echoing
from
the
panelled
walls
stayed
the
long
sleep
of
years
stirring
the
thick
accumulated
dust
to
movement
in
the
ray
of
light
that
falls
from
a
oriel
which
appears
between
the
rafters
just
where
a
stone
mullion
its
carved
apex
rears
faint
voices
whispered
round
me
as
i
stood
spellbound
and
listening
there
the
ghostly
strains
of
melodies
forgot
the
happy
laughter
of
fair
womanhood
children
in
noisy
play
without
a
care
fierce
cries
with
passion
hot
triumphant
some
and
some
wild
with
despair
leaving
the
chamber
so
haunted
by
voices
fearful
i
hastened
to
where
the
great
staircase
rears
its
proud
height
in
a
double
ascension
till
it
is
hid
in
the
deepening
shadows
stiffly
upstanding
on
each
chief
baluster
absently
gaze
the
historical
griffins
plunged
in
their
silent
and
deep
meditation
many
a
caulx
have
they
seen
pass
before
them
long
generations
in
motley
procession
halting
and
feeble
the
sick
and
the
aged
sanguine
and
joyous
the
young
and
the
hopeful
manhood
triumphant
crestfallen
or
thoughtless
urbane
and
discreet
my
lady
confessor
stealthily
creeping
the
villainous
traitor
quick
and
impatient
the
fortunate
lover
children
unconscious
of
aught
but
their
playthings
nobles
in
ermine
and
simpering
ladies
then
the
one
end
of
all
human
emotions
figures
who
bear
on
their
shoulders
silenced
for
ever
some
lord
of
the
staircase
the
steward
from
the
gloom
flung
wide
the
shutters
of
the
showing
a
terrace
graced
with
urn
and
faun
and
steps
that
led
to
a
neglected
lawn
whilst
rounded
hill
and
valley
far
were
seen
lit
by
the
summer
radiating
sheen
the
room
magnificence
its
noble
size
and
faded
splendour
filled
me
with
surprise
a
costly
pierglass
in
its
tarnished
frame
which
once
reflected
gallant
squire
and
dame
now
with
fidelity
displayed
the
clear
and
gleaming
lustres
of
the
chandelier
pendent
with
ten
score
sconces
silver
chased
from
the
high
ceiling
which
a
master
graced
with
courtly
scenes
wherein
could
be
descried
ancestral
figures
in
their
pomp
and
pride
the
sunlight
played
on
gilded
girandole
on
silver
candlestick
and
stiff
console
all
of
that
period
when
here
befell
the
scene
on
which
the
steward
loves
to
dwell
showing
the
floor
dark
stain
of
sombre
red
and
how
it
came
about
that
blood
was
shed
i
marked
the
punchbowls
full
of
leaves
and
dust
a
slim
sword
flecked
with
rust
a
daintily
escutcheoned
chiffonier
inlaid
with
shell
and
finished
with
veneer
timepieces
silent
set
in

the

of

and
to
enhance
the
chamber
stately

great
chippendale
had
made
each
slender
chair
the
stream
of
life
arrested
seemed
to
wait
a
magic
word
to
set
it
flowing
straight
heated
by
wine
and
two
hundred
years
ago
or
more
three
gamblers
on
a
morning
gray
quarrelled
about
a
questioned
score
two
blades
were
soon
engaged
a
tierce
ill
parried
stretched
a
swordsman
low
who
lunged
with
failing
point
but
fierce
and
dying
dropped
before
his
foe
and
when
the
growing
light
of
morn
lit
the
venetian
mirror
face
he
died
pain
and
passion
torn
and
left
a
curse
upon
the
place
and
from
that
day
the
records
show
a
slowly
creeping
sure
decline
that
just
a
hundred
years
ago
ended
the
once
illustrious
line
sometimes
upon
the
dusky
hour
that
comes
before
the
sun
first
rays
when
things
occult
display
their
power
a
strange
light
on
the
chamber
plays
that
is
not
of
the
earth
or
sky
while
hurrying
footsteps
come
and
go
and
then
into
the
silence
die
with
whispered
mutterings
hoarse
and
low
a
sliding
panel
by
the
wainscot
hid
showed
in
the
unmarked
thickness
of
the
walls
a
narrow
passage
and
a
secret
stair
that
brought
us
to
the
level
of
the
moat
long
dry
and
choked
with
bracken
and
with
brier
it
made
a
rugged
pathway
to
a
court
where
stands
the
ruin
of
an
ancient
tower
fenced
in
with
walls
pierced
by
an
entrance
low
here
said
my
guide
when
james
the
first
was
king
a
daughter
of
the
house
through
three
long
years
was
by
her
father
close
a
prisoner
kept
because
she
would
not
wed
the
man
he
chose
stern
and
unyielding
as
became
her
race
she
set
her
will
against
her
father
strength
through
all
the
time
she
saw
no
living
face
no
sound
of
human
voice
except
her
own
fell
on
her
ear
she
nothing
saw
but
clouds
that
swept
athwart
the
cold
and
pitiless
sky
and
blinking
stars
at
night
that
rose
and
set
across
the
little
window
in
the
roof
then
she
went
mad
and
on
the
stony
walls
one
day
beat
out
her
life
in
frenzied
rage
and
refuge
found
beyond
her
father
power
time
passed
and
it
was
late
when
once
again
i
stood
outside
the
ancient
gate
where
the
stone
griffins
ramped
cold
as
relentless
fate
changeless
as
destiny
and
i
said
is
in
vain
guardians
impassible
that
ye
your
watch
maintain
over
the
ghosts
of
caulx
while
the
years
wax
and
wane
century
by
century
for
behold
i
have
been
among
them
and
have
heard
their
voices
i
have
seen
with
eyes
over
their
wide
demesne
of
human
history
the
science
master
we
build
he
said
on
elemental
things
and
paused
to
glance
around
the
silent
class
on
facts
well
ascertained
which
insight
brings
and
which
in
due
development
must
pass
from
the
first
phase
remote
removed
to

thus

we
trace
the
lengthening
chain
of
verity

by

it
seemed

to

then
the

him

he
was
the

of
our

his
calm

incisive
way
admitting
no
alternative
nor

as
he
intoned
his
long
familiar
lay
made
his
pronouncements
clear
as
if
cut
out
of
crystal
cold
with

through
which
he
viewed
complacently
the
span

of
all

quite

bring

new

from
some

through

while
yet
the
saxons
ruled
a
puissant
thane
made
with
his
unkempt
band
of
mounted
spears
a
seizin
of
a
hide
of
forest
land
whereon
he
built
a
house
of
ample
size
with
and
bowers
and
and
stables
shutting
in
a
yard
and
round
the
whole
he
set
a
ponderous
fence
of
sharpened
stakes
fast
bound
with
metal
bands
and
yan
the
wulf
for
thus
the
thane
was
known
called
the
place
wulfden
in
his
savage
tongue
and
here
year
after
year
he
lived
at
ease
oft
making
sallies
for
a
cattle
raid
or
fighting
with
some
other
such
as
he
to
come
back
weary
at
the
fall
of
night
driving
a
herd
before
him
and
his
men
sweating
beneath
the
spoil
of
plundered
foes
once
as
he
sat
at
supper
in
his
hall
bemused
with
mead
and
satisfied
with
food
there
came
a
wandering
bedesman
to
his
gate
craving
permission
in
fayre
jesu
name
to
build
a
church
of
stone
within
the
shade
of
his
protection
and
in
generous
mood
the
thane
gave
gruff
assent
and
time
slipped
by
then
william
swept
the
land
and
to
reward
one
of
his
knights
gave
him
the
wulf
demesne
to
hold
in
fee
and
on
the
saxon
land
arose
a
fortress
with
embattled
walls
with
donjon
keep
and
moat
and
to
hold
in
thraldom
all
the
but
still
was
left
the
little
saxon
church
unchanged
save
that
the
norman
owner
gave
new
consecration
in
his
patron
name
martinus
of
tours
a
warrior
saint
who
guarded
through
the
centuries
his
race
then
in
the
war
of
roses
came
the
crash
that
brought
extinction
to
the
feudal
name
and
desolation
to
its
crumbling
home
and
yet
though
scarred
by
time
and
gray
with
age
the
little
church
of
saxon
days
remained
the
emblem
of
a
faith
the
years
rolled
by
and
then
there
came
a
day
which
gave
a
new
possessor
to
the
place
a
nobleman
in
favour
with
that
queen
who
loved
a
witty
tongue
and
ready
sword
when
coupled
with
good
looks
and
brave
attire
he
built
a
great
elizabethan
pile
the
shaped
to
form
the
royal
e
conforming
to
the
fashion
of
the
times
when
loyalty
spoke
even
from
silent
stone
and
he
to
please
his
lady
pious
whim
though
ten
years
wed
he
called
her
sweetheart
still
forbore
to
raze
the
chapel
to
the
ground
but
stayed
with
flying
buttress
either
side
repaired
the
roof
and
made
it
to
her
mind
and
there
they
lie
both
in
one
marble
tomb
on
which
their
effigies
with
clasping
hands
bear
witness
to
an
everlasting
love
and
when
vacation
brings
its
hours
of
rest
i
sometimes
sit
within
the
saxon
church
and
muse
upon
the
changes
time
has
brought

that
reared
the
little
shrine
and
still
builds

winter
is
winter
and
the
darkening
skies
awake
regretful
memories
of
wooded
hill
and
sunlit
plain
ringing
with
anthems
to
the
sun
until
his
arching
course
was
run
and
nightingales
took
up
the
strain
the
trees
then
dense
with
leaves
and
flowers
stood
through
the
long
and
smiling
hours
housing
an
honest
little
folk
throbbing
with
life
by
day
and
night
whose
voices
vibrant
with
delight
of
happy
labour
ever
spoke
the
trees
now
spread
their
haggard
arms
bared
of
their
pristine
leafy
charms
to
cold
and
unresponsive
skies
that
neither
smile
nor
weep
but
chill
with
cold
indifference
and
kill
hope
that
all
nature
underlies
a
dreary
moan
floats
on
the
wind
from
the
gaunt
oaks
that
ill
defined
show
spectral
shapes
against
the
sky
from
which
the
fleeting
day
has
flown
while
dead
leaves
on
the
earth
are
strown
to
mark
the
summer
mortuary
where
are
the
thousand
things
of
life
that
erstwhile
made
the
place
all
rife
with
busy
hum
and
restless
wing
and
turmoil
of
a
world
of
love
the
blackbird
on
her
nest
above
below
the
beetle
tunnelling
gone
with
the
happiness
i
knew
because
the
heavens
were
always
blue
while
the
sun
shone
from

and

its
cold

sickly
ray
where
once

ceased
only
with
the
falling
night
gloom
hovers
where
triumphant
joy
beatified
each
passing
hour
for

now
with
ruthless
power
fulfils
its
mission
to

not

and
nurse

that
burns

when

to

for

burial
at
sea
was
midnight
in
the
southern
seas
and
windless
on
the
placid
deep
flashed
sparkling
phosphorescences
while
moonbeams
bright
in
silver
bars
lay
like
a
pathway
to
the
stars
tireless
our
engines
day
and
night
a
month
had
throbbed
their
endless
round
without
a
pause
to
mark
time
flight
we
heard
it
all
unconsciously
till
suddenly
it
ceased
to
be
for
now
the
slowing
pulse
that
beat
stopped
in
the
vessel
iron
breast
and
quickly
changed
my
slumber
sweet
to
wandering
and
uneasy
thought
of
what
the
midnight
might
have
brought
gaining
the
deck
i
looked
around
with
drowsy
eyes
and
half
asleep
and
saw
a
something
wrapped
and
bound
and
weighted
i
was
standing
near
some
hapless
seaman
simple
bier
a
shapeless
form
in
canvas
lay
stretched
on
a
wooden
grating
low
waiting
the
word
to
pass
away
into
the
silent
depths
of
sea
and
boundless
realm
of
fantasy
before
the
bulwark
opening
stood
a
group
about
a
lantern
light
moveless
like
figures
carved
in
wood
whilst
one
with
gruff
solemnity
read
prayers
for
those
who
die
at
sea
then
at
the
end
with
sudden
leap
that
sent
the
sparkling
water
high
the
body
plunged
into
the
deep
amid
a
million
points
of
light
that
glittered
as
it
sank
from
sight
scarce
had
a
moment
passed
before
the
men
with
silent
haste
had
gone
the
engines
plied
their
task
once
more
the
ship
her
steady
course
pursued
across
the
moonlit
solitude
the
morning
dawned
the
hours
passed
by
and
life
on
board
from
day
to
day
was
changeless
as
the
sea
and
sky
and
so
unreal
the
memory
seemed
i
wondered
if
i
had
not
dreamed
the
master
of
the
marionettes
was
at
the
fair
of
epinetz
and
all
the
was
there
each
booth
gave
out
its
blatant
strains
and
grinning
came
the
sheepish
swains
who
greeted
with
approving
stare
the
movements
of
the
marionettes
while
from
his
place
well
hid
from
sight
the
master
laboured
faint
and
white
a
villain
dark
with
cloak
and
plume
through
two
acts
of
imbroglio
pursued
a
maid
of
laughing
mien
who
played
a
ribboned
tambourine
and
loved
a
gay
incognito
by
whom
the
villain
met
his
doom
while
pierrot
in
a
comic
part
danced
to
conceal
a
breaking
heart
was
late
the
snow
fell
thick
and
still
the
market
place
in
silence
lay
the
master
tired
and
overwrought
for
troupe
and
self
a
lodging
sought
the
inn
was
full
he
went
his
way
across
the
heath
beyond
the
hill
dawn
found
him
wrapped
from
head
to
feet
in
winter
snowy
and
as
he
sank
in
deadly
sleep
his
spirit
like
a
floating
haze
wavered
a
moment
the
snow
a
valediction
to
bestow
and
solemnly
with
wistful
gaze
the
puppets
bowed
in
reverence
deep
speeding
with
farewells
and
regrets
the
master
of
the
marionettes
love
counterfeit
old
as
mankind
yet
with
immortal
youth
unyielding
ardent
sinuous
and
bold
alluring
ever
in
the
guise
of
truth
where
is
the
fire
that
warmed
me
yesterday
and
where
the
flame
that
will
blaze
to
leave
me
shivering
by
its
ashes
gray
the
wind
that
sweetly
sings
in
ocean
caves
then
dallies
with
the
wallflowers
on
the
tower
may
fan
assassins
and
sweep
over
graves
what
pleasure
has
a
kiss
that
fever
brings
or
one
grown
cold
with
satisfied
desire
the
love
that
on
the
senses
fiercely
plays
comes
like
a
wind
and
passes
like
a
fire
the
most
precious
thing
what
do
men
rate
at
the
highest
in
life
diamonds
that
glow
the
finest
in
water
in
colour
and
form
such
as
an
eastern
king
favourite
wife
wears
strung
in
a
row
or
as
those
that
in
slaughter
in
sack
or
in
storm
of
a
citadel
heights
are
torn
from
a
khalifah
slain
in
the
strife
no
diamonds
decline
when
love
claims
his
own
and
freely
are
bartered
for
kisses
alone
some
say
that
virtue
is
prized
more
than
all
virtue
that
scorns
the
baseness
and
ill
the
decalogue
cites
and
sternly
forbids
to
great
and
to
small
but
when
on
the
horns
of
dilemma
men
kill
compunction
whose
lights
die
in
darkness
profound
where
mortals
are
fated
to
stumble
and
fall
renouncing
for
kisses
the
wisdom
of
time
to
find
in
the
sacrifice
something
sublime
rank
riches
and
fame
have
each
in
their
way
a
hold
on
the
mind
that
we
think
is
supreme
and
sweep
man
along
to
sated
ambition
omnipotent
sway
till
one
day
we
find
they
are
vain
as
a
dream
or
a
beautiful
song
evanescently
grand
and
the
value
we
see
of
the
brave
display
of
riches
and
fame
and
rank
at
their
best
is
far
below
kisses
when
put
to
the
test
autumn
a
light
mist
creeps
across
the
downs
a
gleam
through
clouds
is
faintly
seen
the

the

throws
still
some
welcome

a
chill
comes
with
the
afternoon

icy

the
air
at
night
summer
is
dead
its
shrouded
form
lies
on
the
logs
that
make
its
pyre
and
fancy
sees
its
ghost
ascend
a
shadowy
wraith
above
the
fire
to
l
just
at
this
time
of
great
content
old

come
between
the

the

through

with

the
glorious
past
when
proud

chariots
rolling
fast
and
litters
borne
by
slaves
of
ebon

breasted
the
throng

ever
thicker
grew

it
that
peter
in
a
moment
of

fled
to
escape
martyrdom

was
turned
back
by
a
vision
of

marauding
bees
lighten
their
toil
with

harmonies
whilst
corn
in
rolling
waves
of
verdant
sheen
lends
rhythmic
movement
to
the
rural

and

responsive
to
the
