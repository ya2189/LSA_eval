earth
lies
beholding
with
the
eyes
of
a
lover
the
face
of
the
sun
long
lasteth
the
daylight
and
hope
is
enfolding
the
acres
with
increase
begun
now
sweet
sweet
it
is
through
the
land
to
be
straying
mid
the
birds
and
the
blossoms
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
love
mingles
with
love
and
no
evil
is
weighing
on
thy
heart
or
mine
where
all
sorrow
is
healed
from
township
to
township
down
and
by
tillage
far
far
have
we
wandered
and
long
was
the
day
but
now
cometh
eve
at
the
end
of
the
village
where
over
the
grey
wall
the
church
riseth
grey
there
is
wind
in
the
twilight
in
the
white
road
before
us
the
straw
from
the
is
blowing
about
the
rim
is
rising
a
star
glitters
us
and
the
vane
on
the
is
swinging
in
doubt
down
there
dips
the
highway
toward
the
bridge
crossing
over
the
brook
that
runs
on
to
the
thames
and
the
sea
draw
closer
my
sweet
we
are
lover
and
lover
this
eve
art
thou
given
to
gladness
and
me
shall
we
be
glad
always
come
closer
and
hearken
three
fields
further
on
as
they
told
me
down
there
when
the
young
moon
has
set
if
the
march
sky
should
darken
we
might
see
from
the
the
great
glare
hark
the
wind
in
the
from
london
it
bloweth
and
telling
of
gold
and
of
hope
and
unrest
of
power
that
helps
not
of
wisdom
that
knoweth
but
teacheth
not
aught
of
the
worst
and
the
best
of
the
rich
men
it
telleth
and
strange
is
the
story
how
they
have
and
they
hanker
and
grip
far
and
wide
and
they
live
and
they
die
and
the
earth
and
its
glory
has
been
but
a
burden
they
scarce
might
abide
hark
the
march
wind
again
of
a
people
is
telling
of
the
life
that
they
live
there
so
haggard
and
grim
that
if
we
and
our
love
amidst
them
had
been
dwelling
my
fondness
had
faltered
thy
beauty
grown
dim
this
land
we
have
loved
in
our
love
and
our
leisure
for
them
hangs
in
heaven
high
out
of
their
reach
the
wide
hills
the
for
them
have
no
pleasure
the
grey
homes
of
their
fathers
no
story
to
teach
the
singers
have
sung
and
the
builders
have
builded
the
painters
have
fashioned
their
tales
of
delight
for
what
and
for
whom
hath
the
book
been
gilded
when
all
is
for
these
but
the
blackness
of
night
how
long
and
for
what
is
their
patience
abiding
how
oft
and
how
oft
shall
their
story
be
told
while
the
hope
that
none
seeketh
in
darkness
is
hiding
and
in
grief
and
in
sorrow
the
world
groweth
old
come
back
to
the
inn
love
and
the
lights
and
the
fire
and
the
old
tune
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
for
there
in
a
while
shall
be
rest
and
desire
and
there
shall
the
uprising
be
sweet
yet
love
as
we
wend
the
wind
bloweth
behind
us
and
beareth
the
last
tale
it
telleth
how
here
in
the
the
message
shall
find
us
for
the
hope
that
none
seeketh
is
coming
to
light
like
the
seed
of
midwinter
unheeded
unperished
like
the
wheat
the
snow
lying
green
like
the
love
that
us
unawares
and
uncherished
like
the
babe
thy
girdle
that
groweth
unseen
so
the
hope
of
the
people
now
buddeth
and
rest
fadeth
before
it
and
blindness
and
fear
it
biddeth
us
learn
all
the
wisdom
it
knoweth
it
hath
found
us
and
held
us
and
biddeth
us
hear
for
it
beareth
the
message
up
on
the
morrow
and
go
on
your
ways
toward
the
doubt
and
the
strife
join
hope
to
our
hope
and
blend
sorrow
with
sorrow
and
seek
for
love
in
the
short
days
of
but
lo
the
old
inn
and
the
lights
and
the
fire
and
the
old
tune
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
soon
for
us
shall
be
quiet
and
rest
and
desire
and
uprising
to
deeds
shall
be
sweet
ii
the
bridge
and
the
street
in
the
midst
of
the
bridge
there
we
stopped
and
we
wondered
in
london
at
last
and
the
moon
going
down
all
sullied
and
red
where
the
was
sundered
by
the
void
of
the
the
breath
of
the
town
on
each
side
lay
the
city
and
thames
ran
between
it
dark
struggling
unheard
the
wheels
and
the
feet
a
strange
dream
it
was
that
we
ever
had
seen
it
and
strange
was
the
hope
we
had
wandered
to
meet
was
all
nought
but
confusion
what
man
and
what
master
had
each
of
these
people
that
hastened
along
like
a
flood
flowed
the
faces
and
faster
and
faster
went
the
drift
of
the
feet
of
the
hurrying
throng
till
all
these
seemed
but
one
thing
and
we
twain
another
a
thing
frail
and
feeble
and
young
and
unknown
what
sign
mid
all
these
to
tell
foeman
from
brother
what
sign
of
the
hope
in
our
hearts
that
had
grown
we
went
to
our
lodging
afar
from
the
river
and
slept
and
remembered
in
dreams
and
friends
that
i
knew
not
i
strove
to
deliver
from
a
crowd
that
swept
us
in
measureless
streams
wending
whither
i
knew
not
till
meseemed
i
was
waking
to
the
first
night
in
london
and
lay
by
my
love
and
she
worn
and
changed
and
my
very
heart
aching
with
a
terror
of
soul
that
forbade
me
to
move
till
i
woke
in
good
sooth
and
she
lay
there
beside
me
fresh
lovely
in
sleep
but
awhile
yet
i
lay
for
the
fear
of
the
yet
seemed
to
abide
me
in
the
cold
and
sad
time
ere
the
dawn
of
the
day
then
i
went
to
the
window
and
saw
down
below
me
the
wending
adown
the
dim
street
and
the
scent
of
the
hay
and
the
herbs
seemed
to
know
me
and
seek
out
my
heart
the
sorrow
to
meet
they
passed
and
day
grew
and
with
pitiless
faces
the
dull
houses
stared
on
the
prey
they
had
trapped
as
though
they
had
slain
all
the
fair
morning
places
where
in
love
and
in
leisure
our
joyance
had
happed
my
heart
sank
i
murmured
this
we
are
doing
in
this
grim
net
of
london
this
prison
built
stark
with
the
greed
of
the
ages
our
young
lives
pursuing
a
phantom
that
leads
but
to
death
in
the
dark
day
grew
and
no
longer
was
dusk
with
it
striving
and
now
here
and
there
a
few
people
went
by
as
an
image
of
what
was
once
eager
and
living
seemed
the
hope
that
had
led
us
to
live
or
to
die
yet
nought
else
seemed
happy
the
past
and
its
pleasure
was
light
and
unworthy
had
been
and
was
gone
if
hope
had
deceived
us
if
hid
were
its
treasure
nought
now
would
be
left
us
of
all
life
had
won
o
love
stand
beside
me
the
sun
is
uprisen
on
the
first
day
of
london
and
shame
hath
been
here
for
i
saw
our
new
life
like
the
bars
of
a
prison
and
hope
grew
and
i
parleyed
with
fear
ah
i
sadden
thy
face
and
thy
grey
eyes
are
chiding
yea
but
life
is
no
longer
as
stories
of
yore
from
us
from
henceforth
no
fair
words
shall
be
hiding
the
nights
of
the
wretched
the
days
of
the
poor
time
was
we
have
grieved
we
have
feared
we
have
faltered
for
ourselves
for
each
other
while
yet
we
were
twain
and
no
whit
of
the
world
by
our
sorrow
was
altered
our
faintness
grieved
nothing
our
fear
was
in
vain
now
our
fear
and
our
faintness
our
sorrow
our
passion
we
shall
feel
all
henceforth
as
we
felt
it
erewhile
but
now
from
all
this
the
due
deeds
we
shall
fashion
of
the
eyes
without
blindness
the
heart
without
guile
let
us
grieve
help
every
soul
in
our
sorrow
let
us
press
forward
where
few
dare
to
go
let
us
falter
in
plan
deeds
for
the
morrow
the
world
crowned
with
freedom
the
fall
of
the
foe
as
the
soldier
who
goes
from
his
homestead
and
whose
mouth
yet
remembers
his
embrace
while
all
round
about
him
the
bullets
are
sweeping
but
stern
and
dies
there
in
his
place
yea
so
let
our
lives
be
such
that
hereafter
when
the
battle
is
won
and
the
story
is
told
our
pain
shall
be
hid
and
remembered
our
laughter
and
our
names
shall
be
those
of
the
bright
and
the
bold
section
had
the
following
note
in
it
is
the
intention
of
the
author
to
follow
the
fortunes
of
the
lovers
who
in
the
of
the
march
were
already
touched
by
sympathy
with
the
cause
of
the
people
iii
sending
to
the
war
it
was
down
in
our
village
that
we
heard
of
the
war
begun
but
none
of
the
neighbours
were
in
it
save
the
son
a
youth
and
a
fool
and
a
captain
who
came
and
went
away
and
left
me
glad
of
his
going
there
was
little
for
us
to
say
of
the
war
and
its
why
and
we
said
it
often
enough
the
papers
gave
us
our
wisdom
and
we
used
it
up
in
the
rough
but
i
held
my
peace
and
wondered
for
i
thought
of
the
folly
of
men
the
fair
lives
ruined
and
broken
that
could
be
mended
again
and
the
tale
by
lies
bewildered
and
no
cause
for
a
man
to
choose
nothing
to
curse
or
to
a
game
to
win
or
to
lose
but
here
were
the
streets
of
stalking
wide
in
the
world
and
the
flag
of
an
ancient
people
to
the
unfurled
and
who
was
helping
or
heeding
the
gaudy
shops
displayed
the
toys
of
rich
folly
by
blinded
labour
made
and
still
from
naught
to
nothing
the
horses
drew
dull
men
and
women
with
never
a
deed
to
do
while
all
about
and
around
them
the
ebbed
and
flowed
worn
feet
grey
anxious
faces
grey
backs
bowed
the
load
lo
the
sons
of
an
ancient
people
and
for
this
they
fought
and
fell
in
the
days
by
fame
made
glorious
in
the
tale
that
singers
tell
we
two
we
stood
in
the
street
in
the
midst
of
a
mighty
crowd
the
sound
of
its
mingled
murmur
in
the
heavens
above
was
loud
and
earth
was
foul
with
its
stream
of
every
day
the
hurrying
feet
of
labour
the
faces
worn
and
grey
were
a
sore
and
grievous
sight
and
enough
and
to
spare
had
i
seen
of
hard
and
pinching
want
midst
our
quiet
fields
and
green
but
all
was
nothing
to
this
the
london
holiday
throng
dull
and
with
gait
they
stood
or
shuffled
along
while
the
stench
from
the
lairs
they
had
lain
in
last
night
went
up
in
the
wind
and
poisoned
the
spring
no
story
men
can
find
is
fit
for
the
tale
of
their
lives
no
word
that
man
hath
made
can
tell
the
hue
of
their
faces
or
their
rags
by
filth
for
this
hath
our
age
are
the
sons
of
the
free
who
shall
bear
our
name
triumphant
every
land
and
sea
read
ye
their
souls
in
their
faces
and
what
shall
help
you
there
joyless
hopeless
shameless
angerless
set
is
their
stare
this
is
the
thing
we
have
made
and
what
shall
help
us
now
for
the
field
hath
been
laboured
and
tilled
and
the
teeth
of
the
dragon
shall
grow
but
why
are
they
gathered
together
what
is
this
crowd
in
the
street
this
is
a
holiday
morning
though
here
and
there
we
meet
the
hurrying
broadcloth
or
the
basket
of
tools
men
say
that
at
last
we
are
rending
the
snares
of
knaves
and
fools
that
a
cry
from
the
heart
of
the
nation
against
the
foe
is
hurled
and
the
flag
of
an
ancient
people
to
the
unfurled
the
soldiers
are
off
to
the
war
we
are
here
to
see
the
sight
and
all
our
griefs
shall
be
hidden
by
the
thought
of
our
might
the
ordered
anger
of
england
and
her
hope
for
the
good
of
the
earth
that
we
are
speeding
and
many
a
gift
of
worth
shall
follow
the
brand
and
the
bullet
and
our
wrath
shall
be
no
curse
but
a
blessing
of
life
to
the
we
are
liars
and
and
these
that
we
see
are
the
senders
these
are
they
that
speed
the
dread
and
the
blessing
of
england
to
help
the
world
at
its
need
sick
unto
death
was
my
hope
and
i
turned
and
looked
on
my
dear
and
beheld
her
frightened
wonder
and
her
grief
without
a
tear
and
knew
how
her
thought
was
hark
the
hubbub
and
noise
faint
and
a
long
way
off
the
measured
voice
and
the
crowd
was
swaying
and
swaying
and
somehow
i
knew
not
why
a
dream
came
into
my
heart
of
deliverance
drawing
anigh
then
with
roll
and
thunder
of
drums
grew
the
music
louder
and
loud
and
the
whole
street
tumbled
and
surged
and
cleft
was
the
holiday
crowd
till
two
walls
of
faces
and
rags
lined
either
side
of
the
way
then
clamour
of
shouts
rose
upward
as
bright
and
glittering
gay
came
the
voiceful
brass
of
the
band
and
my
heart
beat
fast
and
fast
for
the
river
of
steel
came
on
and
the
wrath
of
england
passed
through
the
want
and
the
woe
of
the
town
and
strange
and
wild
was
my
thought
and
my
clenched
hands
wandered
about
as
though
a
weapon
they
sought
hubbub
and
din
was
behind
them
and
the
shuffling
haggard
throng
wandering
aimless
about
tangled
the
street
for
long
but
the
shouts
and
the
rhythmic
noise
we
still
heard
far
away
and
my
dream
was
become
a
picture
of
the
deeds
of
another
day
far
and
far
was
i
borne
away
the
years
to
come
and
again
was
the
ordered
march
and
the
thunder
of
the
drum
and
the
bickering
points
of
steel
and
the
horses
shifting
about
the
flashing
swords
of
the
the
silence
after
the
sun
and
wind
in
the
street
familiar
things
made
clear
made
strange
by
the
breathless
waiting
for
the
deeds
that
are
drawing
anear
for
woe
had
grown
into
will
and
wrath
was
bared
of
its
sheath
and
stark
in
the
streets
of
london
stood
the
crop
of
the
teeth
where
then
in
my
dream
were
the
poor
and
the
wall
of
faces
wan
here
and
here
by
my
side
shoulder
to
shoulder
of
man
hope
in
the
simple
folk
hope
in
the
hearts
of
the
wise
for
the
happy
life
to
follow
or
death
and
the
ending
of
lies
hope
is
awake
in
the
faces
angerless
now
no
more
till
the
new
peace
dawn
on
the
world
the
fruit
of
the
war
war
in
the
world
abroad
a
thousand
leagues
away
while
wheel
goes
round
and
day
devoureth
day
peace
at
home
peace
while
the
rich
mill
is
strife
and
the
poor
is
the
grist
that
he
grindeth
and
life
devoureth
life
iv
mother
and
son
now
sleeps
the
land
of
houses
and
dead
night
holds
the
street
and
there
thou
liest
my
baby
and
sleepest
soft
and
sweet
my
man
is
away
for
awhile
but
safe
and
alone
we
lie
and
none
heareth
thy
breath
but
thy
mother
and
the
moon
looking
down
from
the
sky
on
the
weary
waste
of
the
town
as
it
looked
on
the
road
still
warm
with
sun
when
i
left
my
old
abode
hand
in
hand
with
my
love
that
night
of
all
nights
in
the
year
when
the
river
of
love
and
drowned
all
doubt
and
fear
and
we
two
were
alone
in
the
world
and
once
if
never
again
we
knew
of
the
secret
of
earth
and
the
tale
of
its
labour
and
pain
lo
amidst
london
i
lift
thee
and
how
little
and
light
thou
art
and
thou
without
hope
or
fear
thou
fear
and
hope
of
my
heart
lo
here
thy
body
beginning
o
son
and
thy
soul
and
thy
life
but
how
will
it
be
if
thou
livest
and
enterest
into
the
strife
and
in
love
we
dwell
together
when
the
man
is
grown
in
thee
when
thy
sweet
speech
i
shall
hearken
and
yet
thee
and
me
shall
rise
that
wall
of
distance
that
round
each
one
doth
grow
and
maketh
it
hard
and
bitter
each
thought
to
know
now
therefore
while
yet
thou
art
little
and
hast
no
thought
of
thine
own
i
will
tell
thee
a
word
of
the
world
of
the
hope
whence
thou
hast
grown
of
the
love
that
once
begat
thee
of
the
sorrow
that
hath
made
thy
little
heart
of
hunger
and
thy
hands
on
my
bosom
laid
then
mayst
thou
remember
hereafter
as
whiles
when
people
say
all
this
hath
happened
before
in
the
life
of
another
day
so
mayst
thou
dimly
remember
this
tale
of
thy
voice
as
oft
in
the
calm
of
dawning
i
have
heard
the
birds
rejoice
as
oft
i
have
heard
the
go
moaning
through
the
wood
and
i
knew
that
earth
was
speaking
and
the
voice
was
good
now
to
thee
alone
will
i
tell
it
that
thy
body
is
fair
in
the
guise
of
the
country
maidens
who
play
with
the
sun
and
the
air
who
have
stood
in
the
row
of
the
reapers
in
the
august
afternoon
who
have
sat
by
the
frozen
water
in
the
highday
of
the
moon
when
the
lights
of
the
christmas
feasting
were
dead
in
the
house
on
the
hill
and
the
wild
geese
gone
to
the
salt
marsh
had
left
the
winter
still
yea
i
am
fair
my
firstling
if
thou
couldst
but
remember
me
the
hair
that
thy
small
hand
clutcheth
is
a
goodly
sight
to
see
i
am
true
but
my
face
is
a
snare
soft
and
deep
are
my
eyes
and
they
seem
for
beguiling
fulfilled
with
the
dreams
of
the
wise
kind
are
my
lips
and
they
look
as
though
my
soul
had
learned
deep
things
i
have
never
heard
of
my
face
and
my
hands
are
burned
by
the
lovely
sun
of
the
acres
three
months
of
and
thy
have
bleached
them
lo
where
the
edge
of
the
so
said
thy
father
one
day
the
wrist
white
as
curd
from
the
brown
of
the
hands
that
i
love
bright
as
the
wing
of
a
such
is
thy
mother
o
firstling
yet
strong
as
the
maidens
of
old
whose
spears
and
whose
swords
were
the
warders
of
homestead
of
field
and
of
fold
oft
were
my
feet
on
the
highway
often
they
wearied
the
grass
from
dusk
unto
dusk
of
the
summer
three
times
in
a
week
would
i
pass
to
the
downs
from
the
house
on
the
river
through
the
waves
of
the
blossoming
corn
fair
then
i
lay
down
in
the
even
and
fresh
i
arose
on
the
morn
and
scarce
in
the
noon
was
i
weary
ah
son
in
the
days
of
thy
strife
if
thy
soul
could
harbour
a
dream
of
the
blossom
of
my
life
it
would
be
as
sunlit
meadows
beheld
from
a
tossing
sea
and
thy
soul
should
look
on
a
vision
of
the
peace
that
is
to
be
yet
yet
the
tears
on
my
cheek
and
what
is
this
doth
move
my
heart
to
thy
heart
beloved
save
the
flood
of
yearning
love
for
fair
and
fierce
is
thy
father
and
soft
and
strange
are
his
eyes
that
look
on
the
days
that
shall
be
with
the
hope
of
the
brave
and
the
wise
it
was
many
a
day
that
we
laughed
as
over
the
meadows
we
walked
and
many
a
day
i
hearkened
and
the
pictures
came
as
he
talked
it
was
many
a
day
that
we
longed
and
we
lingered
late
at
eve
ere
speech
from
speech
was
sundered
and
my
hand
his
hand
could
leave
then
i
wept
when
i
was
alone
and
i
longed
till
the
daylight
came
and
down
the
stairs
i
stole
and
there
was
our
housekeeping
dame
no
mother
of
me
the
foundling
kindling
the
fire
betimes
ere
the
haymaking
folk
went
forth
to
the
meadows
down
by
the
limes
all
things
i
saw
at
a
glance
the
quickening
leapt
through
the
crackling
heap
of
sticks
and
the
sweet
smoke
up
from
it
crept
and
close
to
the
very
hearth
the
low
sun
flooded
the
floor
and
the
cat
and
her
kittens
played
in
the
sun
by
the
open
door
the
garden
was
fair
in
the
morning
and
there
in
the
road
he
stood
beyond
the
crimson
daisies
and
the
bush
of
southernwood
then
side
by
side
together
through
the
place
we
went
and
o
the
fear
departed
and
the
rest
and
sweet
content
son
sorrow
and
wisdom
he
taught
me
and
sore
i
grieved
and
learned
as
we
twain
grew
into
one
and
the
heart
within
me
burned
with
the
very
hopes
of
his
heart
ah
son
it
is
piteous
but
never
again
in
my
life
shall
i
dare
to
speak
to
thee
thus
so
may
these
lonely
words
about
thee
creep
and
cling
these
words
of
the
lonely
night
in
the
days
of
our
wayfaring
many
a
child
of
woman
is
born
in
the
town
the
desert
of
folly
and
wrong
and
of
what
and
whence
are
they
grown
many
and
many
an
one
of
wont
and
use
is
born
for
a
husband
is
taken
to
bed
as
a
hat
or
a
ribbon
is
worn
prudence
begets
her
thousands
is
a
life
so
shall
i
sell
my
body
that
i
may
be
matron
and
i
shall
endure
foul
wedlock
and
bear
the
children
of
some
are
there
born
of
the
children
of
greed
i
too
can
be
wedded
though
thou
my
love
hast
am
fair
and
hard
of
heart
and
riches
shall
be
my
and
all
these
are
the
good
and
the
happy
on
whom
the
world
dawns
fair
o
son
when
wilt
thou
learn
of
those
that
are
born
of
despair
as
the
fabled
mud
of
the
nile
that
quickens
under
the
sun
with
a
growth
of
creeping
things
half
dead
when
just
begun
such
is
the
care
of
nature
that
man
should
never
die
though
she
breed
of
the
fools
of
the
earth
and
the
dregs
of
the
city
sty
but
thou
o
son
o
son
of
very
love
wert
born
when
our
hope
fulfilled
bred
hope
and
fear
was
a
folly
outworn
on
the
eve
of
the
toil
and
the
battle
all
sorrow
and
grief
we
weighed
we
hoped
and
we
were
not
ashamed
we
knew
and
we
were
not
afraid
now
waneth
the
night
and
the
son
it
is
piteous
that
never
again
in
my
life
shall
i
dare
to
speak
to
thee
thus
but
sure
from
the
wise
and
the
simple
shall
the
mighty
come
to
birth
and
fair
were
my
fate
beloved
if
i
be
yet
on
the
earth
when
the
world
is
awaken
at
last
and
from
mouth
to
mouth
they
tell
of
thy
love
and
thy
deeds
and
thy
valour
and
thy
hope
that
nought
can
quell
v
new
birth
it
was
years
ago
that
i
lay
in
my
lap
new
born
to
life
nor
knowing
one
whit
of
all
that
should
hap
that
day
was
i
won
from
nothing
to
the
world
of
struggle
and
pain
years
am
i
born
again
i
look
and
behold
the
days
of
the
years
that
are
passed
away
and
my
soul
is
full
of
their
wealth
for
oft
were
they
blithe
and
gay
as
the
hours
of
bird
and
of
beast
they
have
made
me
calm
and
strong
to
wade
the
stream
of
confusion
the
river
of
grief
and
wrong
a
rich
man
was
my
father
but
he
skulked
ere
i
was
born
and
gave
my
mother
money
but
left
her
life
to
scorn
and
we
dwelt
alone
in
our
village
i
knew
not
my
but
her
love
and
her
wisdom
i
knew
till
death
and
the
parting
came
then
a
lawyer
paid
me
money
and
i
lived
awhile
at
a
school
and
learned
the
lore
of
the
ancients
and
how
the
knave
and
the
fool
have
been
mostly
the
masters
of
earth
yet
the
earth
seemed
fair
and
good
with
the
wealth
of
field
and
homestead
and
garden
and
river
and
wood
and
i
was
glad
amidst
it
and
little
of
evil
i
knew
as
i
did
in
sport
and
pastime
such
deeds
as
a
youth
might
do
who
deems
he
shall
live
for
ever
till
at
last
it
befel
on
a
day
that
i
came
across
our
frenchman
at
the
edge
of
the
hay
as
he
was
wont
alone
as
he
always
was
so
i
helped
the
dark
old
man
to
bring
a
chub
to
grass
and
somehow
he
knew
of
my
birth
and
somehow
we
came
to
be
friends
till
he
got
to
telling
me
chapters
of
the
tale
that
never
ends
the
battle
of
grief
and
hope
with
riches
and
folly
and
wrong
he
told
how
the
weak
conspire
he
told
of
the
fear
of
the
strong
he
told
of
dreams
grown
deeds
deeds
done
ere
time
was
ripe
of
hope
that
melted
in
air
like
the
smoke
of
his
evening
pipe
of
the
fight
long
after
hope
in
the
teeth
of
all
despair
of
battle
and
prison
and
death
of
life
stripped
naked
and
bare
but
to
me
it
all
seemed
happy
for
i
gilded
all
with
the
gold
of
youth
that
believes
not
in
death
nor
knoweth
of
hope
grown
cold
i
hearkened
and
learned
and
longed
with
a
longing
that
had
no
name
till
i
went
my
ways
to
our
village
and
again
departure
came
wide
now
the
world
was
grown
and
i
saw
things
clear
and
grim
that
awhile
agone
smiled
on
me
from
the
doubtful
and
dim
i
knew
that
the
poor
were
poor
and
had
no
heart
or
hope
and
i
knew
that
i
was
nothing
with
the
least
of
evils
to
cope
so
i
thought
the
thoughts
of
a
man
and
i
fell
into
bitter
mood
wherein
except
as
a
picture
there
was
nought
on
the
earth
that
was
good
till
i
met
the
woman
i
love
and
she
asked
as
folk
ask
of
the
wise
of
the
root
and
meaning
of
things
that
she
saw
in
the
world
of
lies
i
told
her
all
i
knew
and
the
tale
told
lifted
the
load
that
made
me
less
than
a
man
and
she
set
my
feet
on
the
road
so
we
left
our
pleasure
behind
to
seek
for
hope
and
for
life
and
to
london
we
came
if
perchance
there
smouldered
the
embers
of
strife
such
as
our
frenchman
had
told
of
and
i
wrote
to
him
to
ask
if
he
would
be
our
master
and
set
the
learners
their
task
but
was
the
word
on
the
letter
when
it
came
back
to
me
and
all
that
we
saw
henceforward
with
our
own
eyes
must
we
see
so
we
looked
and
wondered
and
sickened
not
for
ourselves
indeed
my
father
by
now
had
died
but
he
left
enough
for
my
need
and
besides
away
in
our
village
the
craft
had
i
learned
and
i
worked
as
other
men
work
and
money
and
wisdom
i
earned
yet
little
from
day
to
day
in
street
or
workshop
i
met
to
nourish
the
plant
of
hope
that
deep
in
my
heart
had
been
set
the
life
of
the
poor
we
learned
and
to
me
there
was
nothing
new
in
their
day
of
little
deeds
that
ever
deathward
drew
but
new
was
the
horror
of
london
that
went
on
all
the
while
that
rich
men
played
at
their
ease
for
name
and
fame
to
beguile
the
days
of
their
empty
lives
and
praised
the
deeds
they
did
as
though
they
had
fashioned
the
earth
and
found
out
the
sun
long
hid
though
some
of
them
busied
themselves
from
hopeless
day
to
day
with
the
lives
of
the
slaves
of
the
rich
and
the
hell
wherein
they
lay
they
wrought
meseems
as
those
who
should
make
a
bargain
with
hell
that
it
grow
a
little
cooler
and
thus
for
ever
to
dwell
so
passed
the
world
on
its
ways
and
weary
with
waiting
we
were
men
ate
and
drank
and
married
no
wild
cry
smote
the
air
no
great
crowd
ran
together
to
greet
the
day
of
doom
and
ever
more
and
more
seemed
the
town
like
a
monstrous
tomb
to
us
the
pilgrims
of
hope
until
it
came
and
hope
on
the
stones
of
the
street
is
written
in
letters
of
flame
this
is
how
it
befel
a
workmate
of
mine
had
heard
some
bitter
speech
in
my
mouth
and
he
took
me
up
at
the
word
and
said
over
to
our
radical
for
there
if
we
hear
nothing
new
at
least
we
shall
see
a
new
face
he
is
one
of
those
communist
chaps
and
like
that
you
two
may
so
we
went
and
the
street
was
as
dull
and
as
common
as
aught
you
could
see
dull
and
dirty
the
room
just
over
the
chair
was
a
bust
a
face
with
nose
cocked
up
in
the
air
there
were
common
prints
on
the
wall
of
the
heads
of
the
party
fray
and
mazzini
dark
and
lean
amidst
them
gone
astray
some
thirty
men
we
were
of
the
kind
that
i
knew
full
well
listless
rubbed
down
to
the
type
of
our
hell
my
heart
sank
down
as
i
entered
and
wearily
there
i
sat
while
the
chairman
strove
to
end
his
maunder
of
this
and
of
that
and
partly
shy
he
seemed
and
partly
indeed
ashamed
of
the
grizzled
man
beside
him
as
his
name
to
us
he
named
he
rose
thickset
and
short
and
dressed
in
shabby
blue
and
even
as
he
began
it
seemed
as
though
i
knew
the
thing
he
was
going
to
say
though
i
never
heard
it
before
he
spoke
were
it
well
were
it
ill
as
though
a
message
he
bore
a
word
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
many
a
million
of
men
nor
aught
seemed
the
sordid
room
and
the
few
that
were
listening
then
save
the
hall
of
the
labouring
earth
and
the
world
which
was
to
be
bitter
to
many
the
message
but
sweet
indeed
unto
me
of
man
without
a
master
and
earth
without
a
strife
and
every
soul
rejoicing
in
the
sweet
and
bitter
of
life
of
peace
and
he
told
and
i
knew
that
in
faith
he
spake
but
his
words
were
my
very
thoughts
and
i
saw
the
battle
awake
and
i
followed
from
end
to
end
and
triumph
grew
in
my
heart
as
he
called
on
each
that
heard
him
to
arise
and
play
his
part
in
the
tale
of
the
gospel
lest
as
slaves
they
should
live
and
die
he
ceased
and
i
thought
the
hearers
would
rise
up
with
one
cry
and
bid
him
straight
enrol
them
but
they
they
applauded
indeed
for
the
man
was
grown
full
eager
and
had
made
them
hearken
and
heed
but
they
sat
and
made
no
sign
and
two
of
the
glibber
kind
stood
up
to
jeer
and
to
carp
his
fiery
words
to
blind
i
did
not
listen
to
them
but
failed
not
his
voice
to
hear
when
he
rose
to
answer
the
carpers
striving
to
make
more
clear
that
which
was
clear
already
not
overwell
i
knew
he
answered
the
sneers
and
the
silence
so
hot
and
eager
he
grew
but
my
hope
full
well
he
answered
and
when
he
called
again
on
men
to
band
together
lest
they
live
and
die
in
vain
in
fear
lest
he
should
escape
me
i
rose
ere
the
meeting
was
done
and
gave
him
my
name
and
my
i
was
the
only
one
he
smiled
as
he
heard
the
jeers
and
there
was
a
shake
of
the
hand
he
spoke
like
a
friend
long
known
and
lo
i
was
one
of
the
band
and
now
the
streets
seem
gay
and
the
high
stars
glittering
bright
and
for
me
i
sing
amongst
them
for
my
heart
is
full
and
light
i
see
the
deeds
to
be
done
and
the
day
to
come
on
the
earth
and
riches
vanished
away
and
sorrow
turned
to
mirth
i
see
the
city
squalor
and
the
country
stupor
gone
and
we
a
part
of
it
twain
no
longer
alone
in
the
days
to
come
of
the
pleasure
in
the
days
that
are
of
the
i
was
born
once
long
ago
i
am
born
again
vi
the
new
proletarian
how
near
to
the
goal
are
we
now
and
what
shall
we
live
to
behold
will
it
come
a
day
of
surprise
to
the
best
of
the
hopeful
and
bold
shall
the
sun
arise
some
morning
and
see
men
falling
to
work
smiling
and
loving
their
lives
not
fearing
the
ill
that
may
lurk
in
every
house
on
their
road
in
the
very
ground
that
they
tread
shall
the
sun
see
famine
slain
and
the
fear
of
children
dead
shall
he
look
adown
on
men
set
free
from
the
burden
of
care
and
the
earth
grown
like
to
himself
so
comely
clean
and
fair
or
else
will
it
linger
and
loiter
till
hope
deferred
hath
spoiled
all
bloom
of
the
life
of
the
day
for
which
we
have
toiled
till
our
hearts
be
turned
to
stone
by
the
griefs
that
we
have
borne
and
our
loving
kindness
seared
by
love
from
our
anguish
torn
till
our
hope
grow
a
wrathful
fire
and
the
light
of
the
second
birth
be
a
flame
to
burn
up
the
weeds
from
the
lean
impoverished
earth
this
meseems
it
was
but
a
little
while
ago
when
the
merest
sparkle
of
hope
set
all
my
heart
aglow
the
hope
of
the
day
was
enough
but
now
the
very
day
that
wearies
my
hope
with
longing
changed
or
gone
away
or
what
is
it
drags
at
my
it
aught
save
the
fear
in
this
little
room
where
i
sit
is
all
that
i
hold
most
my
love
and
the
love
we
have
fashioned
my
wife
and
the
little
lad
yet
the
four
walls
look
upon
us
with
other
eyes
than
they
had
for
indeed
a
thing
hath
happened
last
week
at
my
craft
i
worked
lest
oft
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
my
heart
should
tell
me
i
shirked
but
i
work
for
us
three
lest
he
and
she
and
i
in
the
mud
of
the
street
should
draggle
till
we
come
to
the
workhouse
or
die
not
long
to
tell
is
the
story
for
as
i
told
you
before
a
lawyer
paid
me
the
money
which
came
from
my
store
well
now
the
lawyer
is
dead
and
a
curious
tangle
of
theft
it
seems
is
what
he
has
lived
by
and
none
of
my
money
is
left
so
i
who
have
worked
for
my
pleasure
now
work
for
utter
need
in
noble
army
of
i
now
am
a
soldier
indeed
are
young
you
belong
to
the
class
that
you
love
saith
the
rich
sneer
on
with
your
class
and
be
all
that
i
hearken
to
hear
nor
heed
the
laughter
much
have
patience
a
little
while
i
will
tell
you
in
my
heart
nor
hide
a
jot
by
guile
when
i
worked
pretty
much
for
my
pleasure
i
really
worked
with
a
will
it
was
well
and
workmanlike
done
and
my
fellows
knew
my
skill
and
deemed
me
one
of
themselves
though
they
called
me
gentleman
dick
since
they
knew
i
had
some
money
but
now
that
to
work
i
must
stick
or
fall
into
utter
ruin
something
gone
i
find
the
work
goes
cleared
is
the
job
but
something
left
behind
i
take
up
fear
with
my
chisel
fear
lies
me
and
my
plane
and
i
wake
in
the
merry
morning
to
a
new
unwonted
pain
fear
i
shall
live
it
many
a
thing
besides
till
i
win
the
poor
dulled
heart
which
the
jacket
hides
were
it
not
for
the
hope
of
hopes
i
know
my
end
and
would
wish
i
had
been
born
the
weary
way
to
wend
now
further
well
you
may
think
we
have
lived
no
life
my
wife
is
my
servant
and
i
am
the
servant
of
my
wife
and
we
make
no
work
for
each
other
but
country
folk
we
were
and
she
sickened
sore
for
the
grass
and
the
breath
of
the
fragrant
air
that
had
made
her
lovely
and
strong
and
so
up
here
we
came
to
the
northern
slopes
of
the
town
to
live
with
a
country
dame
who
can
talk
of
the
ways
not
one
of
the
newest
the
house
the
woodwork
worn
to
the
bone
its
panels
the
land
of
the
mouse
its
windows
rattling
and
loose
its
floors
all
up
and
down
but
this
at
least
it
was
just
a
cottage
left
in
the
town
there
might
you
sit
in
our
parlour
in
the
sunday
afternoon
and
watch
the
sun
through
the
and
fall
to
dreaming
that
soon
you
would
see
the
grey
team
passing
their
fetlocks
wet
with
the
brook
or
the
shining
mountainous
there
the
summer
moon
would
look
through
the
leaves
on
the
lampless
room
wherein
we
sat
we
twain
all
london
vanished
away
and
the
morn
of
the
summer
rain
would
waft
us
the
scent
of
the
hay
or
the
first
faint
yellow
leaves
would
flutter
adown
before
us
and
tell
of
the
acres
of
sheaves
all
this
hath
our
lawyer
eaten
and
must
we
go
to
a
room
near
my
shop
in
the
purlieus
of
soho
no
words
of
its
shabby
meanness
but
that
is
our
in
the
jail
of
weary
london
therein
for
us
must
dwell
the
hope
of
the
world
that
shall
be
that
rose
a
glimmering
spark
as
the
last
thin
flame
of
our
pleasure
sank
quavering
in
the
dark
again
the
rich
man
jeereth
man
is
a
coward
or
he
bewails
his
feeble
pleasure
he
quails
before
the
curse
which
many
a
man
endureth
with
calm
and
smiling
nay
the
man
is
a
man
by
your
leave
or
put
yourself
in
his
place
and
see
if
the
tale
reads
better
the
haven
of
rest
destroyed
and
nothing
left
of
the
life
that
was
once
so
well
enjoyed
but
leave
to
live
and
labour
and
the
glimmer
of
hope
deferred
now
know
i
the
cry
of
the
poor
no
more
as
a
story
heard
but
rather
a
wordless
wail
forced
forth
from
the
weary
heart
now
now
when
hope
ariseth
i
shall
surely
know
my
part
a
little
more
to
tell
when
those
last
words
were
said
at
least
i
was
yet
and
earning
daily
bread
but
now
all
that
is
changed
and
meseems
adown
the
stair
that
leads
to
the
nethermost
pit
man
wife
and
child
must
fare
when
i
joined
the
communist
folk
i
did
what
in
me
lay
to
learn
the
grounds
of
their
faith
i
read
day
after
day
whatever
books
i
could
handle
and
heard
about
and
about
what
talk
was
going
amongst
them
and
i
burned
up
doubt
after
doubt
until
it
befel
at
last
that
to
others
i
needs
must
speak
indeed
they
pressed
me
to
that
while
yet
i
was
weaker
than
weak
so
i
began
the
business
and
in
i
spake
to
knots
of
men
indeed
that
made
my
very
heart
ache
so
hopeless
it
seemed
for
some
stood
by
like
men
of
wood
and
some
though
fain
to
listen
but
a
few
words
understood
and
some
but
hooted
and
jeered
but
whiles
across
some
i
came
who
were
keen
and
eager
to
hear
as
in
dry
flax
the
flame
so
the
quick
thought
flickered
amongst
them
and
that
indeed
was
a
feast
so
about
the
streets
i
went
and
the
work
on
my
hands
increased
and
to
say
the
very
truth
betwixt
the
smooth
and
the
rough
it
was
work
and
hope
went
with
it
and
i
liked
it
well
enough
nor
made
i
any
secret
of
all
that
i
was
at
but
daily
talked
in
our
shop
and
spoke
of
this
and
of
that
then
vanished
my
money
away
and
like
a
fool
i
told
some
one
or
two
of
the
loss
did
that
make
the
master
bold
before
i
was
one
of
his
lot
and
as
queer
as
my
head
might
be
i
might
do
pretty
much
as
i
liked
well
now
he
sent
for
me
and
spoke
out
in
very
words
my
thought
of
the
rich
jeer
sir
you
have
got
your
wish
as
far
as
i
can
hear
and
are
now
no
thief
of
labour
but
an
honest
working
man
now
give
you
a
word
of
warning
stay
in
it
as
long
as
you
can
this
working
lot
that
you
like
so
pretty
well
off
as
you
are
so
take
another
warning
i
have
thought
you
went
too
far
and
now
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
so
make
an
end
of
your
talk
at
once
and
for
ever
henceforth
or
out
of
my
shop
you
walk
there
are
plenty
of
men
to
be
had
who
are
quite
as
good
as
you
and
mind
you
anywhere
else
scarce
get
work
to
do
unless
you
rule
your
tongue
morning
stick
to
your
the
hot
blood
rose
to
my
eyes
somewhere
a
thought
did
lurk
to
finish
both
him
and
the
job
but
i
knew
now
what
i
was
and
out
of
the
little
office
in
helpless
rage
did
i
pass
and
went
to
my
work
a
for
the
sake
of
my
child
and
my
sweet
did
men
look
for
the
brand
on
my
forehead
that
eve
as
i
went
through
the
street
and
what
was
the
end
after
all
why
one
of
my
shopmates
heard
my
next
speech
in
the
street
and
passed
on
some
bitter
word
and
that
week
came
a
word
with
my
money
come
and
the
shame
of
my
four
silence
had
been
but
grief
in
vain
well
i
see
the
days
before
me
this
time
we
shall
not
die
nor
go
to
the
workhouse
at
once
i
shall
get
work
and
shall
work
in
fear
at
first
and
at
last
forget
my
fear
and
drudge
on
from
day
to
day
since
it
seems
that
i
hold
life
dear
the
lot
of
many
millions
yet
if
half
of
those
millions
knew
the
hope
that
my
heart
hath
learned
we
should
find
a
deed
to
do
and
who
or
what
should
withstand
us
and
i
i
might
live
to
know
the
love
of
my
fellows
and
the
gifts
that
earth
can
give
vii
in
at
home
the
first
of
the
nights
is
this
and
i
can
not
go
to
bed
i
long
for
the
dawning
sorely
although
when
the
night
shall
be
dead
scarce
to
me
shall
the
day
be
alive
twice
nights
more
twice
long
days
till
the
evil
dream
be
and
he
does
he
count
the
hours
as
he
lies
in
his
does
he
nurse
and
cherish
his
pain
nay
i
know
his
strong
heart
well
swift
shall
his
soul
fare
forth
he
is
here
and
bears
me
away
till
hand
in
hand
we
depart
toward
the
hope
of
the
earlier
day
yea
here
or
there
he
sees
it
in
the
street
in
the
cell
he
sees
the
vision
he
made
me
behold
mid
the
stems
of
the
blossoming
trees
when
spring
lay
light
on
the
earth
and
first
and
at
last
i
knew
how
sweet
was
his
clinging
hand
how
fair
were
the
deeds
he
would
do
nay
how
wilt
thou
weep
and
be
soft
and
cherish
a
pleasure
in
pain
when
the
days
and
their
task
are
before
thee
and
awhile
thou
must
work
for
twain
o
face
thou
shalt
lose
yet
more
of
thy
fairness
be
thinner
no
doubt
and
be
waxen
white
and
worn
by
the
day
that
he
cometh
out
hand
how
pale
thou
shalt
be
how
changed
from
the
sunburnt
hand
that
he
kissed
as
it
handled
the
rake
in
the
noon
of
the
summer
land
let
me
think
then
it
is
but
a
trifle
the
neighbours
have
told
me
so
months
why
that
is
nothing
and
the
time
will
speedily
empty
bed
let
me
work
then
for
his
sake
i
will
copy
out
the
paper
which
he
thought
the
news
might
take
if
my
eyes
may
see
the
letters
a
picture
of
our
life
and
the
little
deeds
of
our
days
ere
we
thought
of
prison
and
strife
yes
neighbour
yes
i
am
i
was
late
last
night
bedless
i
wore
through
the
hours
and
made
a
shift
to
write
it
was
kind
of
you
to
come
nor
will
it
grieve
me
at
all
to
tell
you
why
in
prison
and
how
the
thing
did
befal
for
i
know
you
are
with
us
at
heart
and
belike
will
join
us
soon
it
was
thus
we
went
to
a
meeting
on
saturday
afternoon
at
a
new
place
down
in
the
west
a
wretched
quarter
enough
where
the
rich
houses
are
elbowed
by
ragged
streets
and
rough
which
are
worse
than
they
seem
to
be
poor
thing
you
know
too
well
how
pass
the
days
and
the
nights
within
that
bricken
hell
there
then
on
a
bit
of
waste
we
stood
the
rich
and
the
poor
and
jack
was
the
first
to
speak
that
was
he
that
you
met
at
the
door
last
week
it
was
quiet
at
first
and
dull
they
most
of
them
stood
as
though
they
heeded
nothing
nor
thought
of
bad
or
of
good
not
even
that
they
were
poor
and
haggard
and
dirty
and
dull
nay
some
were
so
rich
indeed
that
they
with
liquor
were
full
and
dull
wrath
rose
in
their
souls
as
the
hot
words
went
by
their
ears
for
they
deemed
they
were
mocked
and
rated
by
men
that
were
more
than
their
peers
but
for
some
they
seemed
to
think
that
a
prelude
was
all
this
to
the
preachment
of
saving
of
souls
and
hell
and
endless
bliss
while
some
o
the
hearts
of
slaves
although
they
might
understand
when
they
heard
their
masters
and
feeders
called
thieves
of
wealth
and
of
land
were
as
angry
as
though
were
cursed
withal
there
were
some
that
heard
and
stood
and
pondered
it
all
and
garnered
a
hope
and
a
word
ah
heavy
my
heart
was
grown
as
i
gazed
on
the
terrible
throng
lo
these
that
should
have
been
the
glad
and
the
deft
and
the
strong
how
were
they
dull
and
abased
as
the
very
filth
of
the
road
and
who
should
waken
their
souls
or
clear
their
hearts
of
the
load
the
crowd
was
growing
and
growing
and
therewith
the
jeering
grew
and
now
that
the
time
was
come
for
an
ugly
brawl
i
knew
when
i
saw
how
midst
of
the
workmen
some
men
there
came
of
the
scum
of
the
brutes
void
of
pity
or
shame
the
thief
is
a
saint
beside
them
these
raised
a
jeering
noise
and
our
speaker
quailed
before
it
and
the
hubbub
drowned
his
voice
then
richard
put
him
aside
and
rose
at
once
in
his
place
and
over
the
rags
and
the
squalor
beamed
out
his
beautiful
face
and
his
sweet
voice
rang
through
the
tumult
and
i
think
the
crowd
would
have
hushed
and
hearkened
his
manly
words
but
a
reptile
pushed
right
into
the
ring
about
us
and
screeched
out
infamies
that
sickened
the
soul
to
hearken
till
he
caught
my
angry
eyes
and
my
voice
that
cried
out
at
him
and
straight
on
me
he
turned
a
foul
word
smote
my
heart
and
his
cane
on
my
shoulders
burned
but
as
a
kestrel
stoops
down
richard
leapt
from
his
stool
and
drave
his
strong
right
hand
amidst
the
mouth
of
the
fool
then
all
was
mingled
together
and
away
from
him
was
i
torn
and
hustled
hither
and
thither
on
the
surging
crowd
was
borne
but
at
last
i
felt
my
feet
for
the
crowd
began
to
thin
and
i
looked
about
for
richard
that
away
from
thence
we
might
win
when
lo
the
police
amidst
us
and
richard
hustled
along
betwixt
a
pair
of
as
the
doer
of
all
the
wrong
little
longer
friend
is
the
story
i
scarce
have
seen
him
again
i
could
not
get
him
bail
despite
my
trouble
and
pain
and
this
morning
he
stood
in
the
dock
for
all
that
that
might
avail
they
might
just
as
well
have
dragged
him
at
once
to
the
destined
jail
the
police
had
got
their
man
and
they
meant
to
keep
him
there
and
whatever
tale
was
needful
they
had
no
trouble
to
swear
well
the
fool
on
the
bench
was
busy
it
seems
that
day
and
so
with
the
words
months
he
swept
the
case
away
yet
he
lectured
my
man
ere
he
went
but
not
for
the
riot
indeed
for
which
he
was
sent
to
prison
but
for
holding
a
dangerous
creed
have
you
got
to
do
to
preach
such
perilous
stuff
to
take
some
care
of
yourself
should
find
you
work
enough
if
you
needs
must
preach
or
lecture
then
hire
a
chapel
or
hall
though
indeed
if
you
take
my
advice
just
preach
nothing
at
all
but
stick
to
your
work
you
seem
clever
who
knows
but
you
might
rise
and
become
a
little
builder
should
you
condescend
to
be
wise
for
in
spite
of
your
silly
sedition
the
land
that
we
live
in
is
free
and
opens
a
pathway
to
merit
for
you
as
well
as
for
ah
friend
am
i
grown
with
the
lonely
grief
of
the
night
that
i
babble
of
this
babble
me
how
little
and
light
is
this
beginning
of
trouble
to
all
that
yet
shall
be
at
worst
but
as
the
shower
that
lays
but
a
yard
of
the
corn
before
the
hailstorm
cometh
and
flattens
the
field
to
the
earth
o
for
a
word
from
my
love
of
the
hope
of
the
second
birth
could
he
clear
my
vision
to
see
the
sword
creeping
out
of
the
sheath
inch
by
inch
as
we
writhe
in
the
toils
of
our
living
death
could
he
but
strengthen
my
heart
to
know
that
we
can
not
fail
for
alas
i
am
lonely
and
feeble
and
frail
i
am
as
the
poor
of
the
earth
they
that
are
now
alive
and
where
is
their
might
and
their
cunning
with
the
mighty
of
men
to
strive
though
they
that
come
after
be
strong
to
win
the
day
and
the
crown
ah
ever
must
we
the
deedless
to
the
deedless
dark
go
down
still
crying
yet
shall
be
the
arising
happy
earth
and
and
we
not
there
to
greet
and
its
life
we
yearn
and
where
is
the
end
of
toiling
and
whitherward
now
shall
we
turn
but
to
patience
ever
patience
and
yet
and
yet
to
bear
and
yet
forlorn
unanswered
as
oft
before
to
hear
through
the
tales
of
the
ancient
fathers
and
the
dreams
that
mock
our
wrong
that
cry
to
the
naked
heavens
long
o
lord
how
long
viii
the
half
of
life
gone
the
days
have
slain
the
days
and
the
seasons
have
gone
by
and
brought
me
the
summer
again
and
here
on
the
grass
i
lie
as
erst
i
lay
and
was
glad
ere
i
meddled
with
right
and
with
wrong
wide
lies
the
mead
as
of
old
and
the
river
is
creeping
along
by
the
side
of
the
bank
that
turns
its
weedy
stream
and
grey
its
hither
lip
the
quivering
rushes
gleam
there
is
work
in
the
mead
as
of
old
they
are
eager
at
winning
the
hay
while
every
sun
sets
bright
and
begets
a
fairer
day
the
forks
shine
white
in
the
sun
round
the
yellow
wain
where
the
mountain
of
hay
grows
fast
and
now
from
out
of
the
lane
comes
the
drawing
another
comes
the
bailiff
and
the
beer
and
thump
thump
goes
the
nag
the
narrow
bridge
of
the
weir
high
up
and
light
are
the
clouds
and
though
the
swallows
flit
so
high
the
sunlit
earth
they
are
well
a
part
of
it
and
so
though
high
over
them
are
the
wings
of
the
wandering
herne
in
measureless
depths
above
him
doth
the
fair
sky
quiver
and
burn
the
dear
sun
floods
the
land
as
the
morning
falls
toward
noon
and
a
little
wind
is
awake
in
the
best
of
the
latter
june
they
are
busy
winning
the
hay
and
the
life
and
the
picture
they
make
if
i
were
as
once
i
was
i
should
deem
it
made
for
my
sake
for
here
if
one
need
not
work
is
a
place
for
happy
rest
while
thought
wends
over
the
world
north
south
and
east
and
west
there
are
the
men
and
the
maids
and
the
wives
and
the
gaffers
grey
of
the
fields
i
know
so
well
and
but
little
changed
are
they
since
i
was
a
lad
amongst
them
and
yet
how
great
is
the
change
strange
are
they
grown
unto
me
yea
i
to
myself
am
strange
their
talk
and
their
laughter
mingling
with
the
music
of
the
meads
has
now
no
meaning
to
me
to
help
or
to
hinder
my
needs
so
far
from
them
have
i
drifted
and
yet
amidst
them
goes
a
part
of
myself
my
boy
and
of
pleasure
and
pain
he
knows
and
deems
it
something
strange
when
he
is
other
than
glad
lo
now
the
woman
that
stoops
and
kisses
the
face
of
the
lad
and
puts
a
rake
in
his
hand
and
laughs
in
his
laughing
whose
is
the
voice
that
laughs
in
the
old
familiar
place
whose
should
it
be
but
my
if
my
love
were
yet
on
the
earth
could
she
refrain
from
the
fields
where
my
joy
and
her
joy
had
birth
when
i
was
there
and
her
child
on
the
grass
that
knew
her
feet
mid
the
flowers
that
led
her
on
when
the
summer
eve
was
sweet
no
no
it
is
she
no
longer
never
again
can
she
come
and
behold
the
creeping
the
meadows
of
her
home
no
more
can
she
kiss
her
son
or
put
the
rake
in
his
hand
that
she
handled
a
while
agone
in
the
midst
of
the
haymaking
band
her
laughter
is
gone
and
her
life
there
is
no
such
thing
on
the
earth
no
share
for
me
then
in
the
stir
no
share
in
the
hurry
and
mirth
nay
let
me
look
and
believe
that
all
these
will
vanish
away
at
least
when
the
night
has
fallen
and
that
she
will
be
there
mid
the
hay
happy
and
weary
with
work
waiting
and
longing
for
love
there
will
she
be
as
of
old
when
the
great
moon
hung
above
and
lightless
and
dead
was
the
village
and
nought
but
the
weir
was
awake
there
will
she
rise
to
meet
me
and
my
hands
will
she
hasten
to
take
and
thence
shall
we
wander
away
and
over
the
ancient
bridge
by
many
a
hedgerow
till
we
reach
the
ridge
and
the
great
trench
digged
by
the
romans
there
then
awhile
shall
we
stand
to
watch
the
dawn
come
creeping
the
fragrant
lovely
land
till
all
the
world
awaketh
and
draws
us
down
we
twain
to
the
deeds
of
the
field
and
the
fold
and
the
merry
gain
ah
thus
only
thus
shall
i
see
her
in
dreams
of
the
day
or
the
night
when
my
soul
is
beguiled
of
its
sorrow
to
remember
past
delight
she
is
gone
she
was
and
she
is
not
there
is
no
such
thing
on
the
earth
but
as
a
picture
painted
and
for
me
there
is
void
and
dearth
that
i
can
not
name
or
measure
yet
for
me
and
all
these
she
died
as
she
lived
for
awhile
that
the
better
day
might
betide
therefore
i
live
and
i
shall
live
till
the
last
work
shall
fail
have
patience
now
but
a
little
and
i
will
tell
you
the
tale
of
how
and
why
she
died
and
why
i
am
weak
and
worn
and
have
wandered
away
to
the
meadows
and
the
place
where
i
was
born
but
here
and
i
can
not
for
ever
my
thought
will
stray
to
that
hope
fulfilled
for
a
little
and
the
bliss
of
the
earlier
day
of
the
great
hope
and
anguish
i
scarce
can
think
like
a
ghost
from
the
lives
of
the
living
and
their
earthly
deeds
i
shrink
i
will
go
adown
by
the
water
and
over
the
ancient
bridge
and
wend
in
our
footsteps
of
old
till
i
come
to
the
ridge
and
the
great
trench
digged
by
the
romans
and
thence
awhile
will
i
gaze
and
see
three
teeming
counties
stretch
out
till
they
fade
in
the
haze
and
in
all
the
dwellings
of
man
that
thence
mine
eyes
shall
see
what
man
as
hapless
as
i
am
beneath
the
sun
shall
be
o
fool
what
words
are
these
thou
hast
a
sorrow
to
nurse
and
thou
hast
been
bold
and
happy
but
these
if
they
utter
a
curse
no
sting
it
has
and
no
is
empty
sound
on
the
air
thy
life
is
full
of
mourning
and
theirs
so
empty
and
bare
that
they
have
no
words
of
complaining
nor
so
happy
have
they
been
that
they
may
measure
sorrow
or
tell
what
grief
may
mean
and
thou
thou
hast
deeds
to
do
and
toil
to
meet
thee
soon
depart
and
ponder
on
these
through
the
afternoon
ix
a
new
friend
i
have
promised
to
tell
you
the
story
of
how
i
was
left
alone
sick
and
wounded
and
sore
and
why
the
woman
is
gone
that
i
deemed
a
part
of
my
life
tell
me
when
all
is
told
if
you
deem
it
fit
that
the
earth
that
the
world
of
men
should
hold
my
work
and
my
weariness
still
yet
think
of
that
other
life
the
child
of
me
and
of
her
and
the
years
and
the
coming
strife
after
i
came
out
of
prison
our
living
was
hard
to
earn
by
the
work
of
my
hands
and
of
hers
to
shifts
we
had
to
turn
such
as
the
poor
know
well
and
the
rich
can
not
understand
and
just
out
of
the
gutter
we
stood
still
loving
and
hand
in
hand
do
you
ask
me
if
still
amidst
all
i
held
the
hunt
in
view
and
the
hope
of
the
morning
of
life
all
the
things
i
should
do
and
undo
be
easy
i
am
not
a
coward
nay
little
prudence
i
learned
i
spoke
and
i
suffered
for
speaking
and
my
meat
by
my
manhood
was
burned
when
the
poor
man
rebels
the
whip
lies
ready
anear
but
he
who
is
rebel
and
rich
may
live
safe
for
many
a
year
while
he
warms
his
heart
with
pictures
of
all
the
glory
to
come
the
storm
of
the
press
and
the
critics
maybe
but
sweet
is
his
home
there
is
meat
in
the
morn
and
the
even
and
rest
when
the
day
is
done
all
is
fair
and
orderly
there
as
the
rising
and
setting
and
i
know
both
the
rich
and
the
poor
well
i
grew
bitter
they
said
not
unlike
that
i
did
for
bitter
indeed
was
my
bread
and
surely
the
nursling
plant
shall
smack
of
its
nourishing
soil
and
here
was
our
life
in
short
pinching
and
worry
and
toil
one
petty
fear
thrust
out
by
another
come
in
its
place
each
scrap
of
life
but
a
fear
and
the
sum
of
it
wretched
and
base
so
fare
millions
of
men
where
men
for
money
are
made
where
the
poor
are
dumb
and
deedless
where
the
rich
are
not
afraid
ah
am
i
bitter
again
well
these
are
our
the
very
base
of
order
and
the
foundation
rock
is
it
so
good
and
so
safe
that
their
manhood
should
be
outworn
by
the
struggle
for
anxious
life
the
dull
pain
dismally
borne
till
all
that
was
man
within
them
is
dead
and
vanished
away
were
it
not
even
better
that
all
these
should
think
on
a
day
as
they
look
on
each
sad
faces
and
see
how
many
they
are
are
these
tales
of
old
time
of
men
who
were
mighty
in
war
they
fought
for
some
dominion
for
the
name
of
a
forest
or
field
they
fell
that
no
token
should
be
blazoned
on
their
shield
and
for
this
is
their
valour
praised
and
dear
is
their
renown
and
their
names
are
beloved
for
ever
and
they
wear
the
crown
and
shall
we
then
wait
in
the
streets
and
this
heap
of
misery
till
their
stones
rise
up
to
help
us
or
the
far
heavens
set
us
free
for
we
we
shall
fight
for
no
name
no
blazon
on
banner
or
shield
but
that
man
to
man
may
hearken
and
the
earth
her
increase
yield
that
never
again
in
the
world
may
be
sights
like
we
have
seen
that
never
again
in
the
world
may
be
men
like
we
have
been
that
never
again
like
ours
may
be
manhood
spoilt
and
yea
even
so
was
i
bitter
and
this
was
my
evilest
word
and
be
spent
for
our
hope
and
you
at
least
shall
be
free
though
you
be
rugged
and
coarse
as
wasted
and
worn
as
you
well
i
was
and
denounced
and
scarcely
at
last
might
we
stand
from
out
of
the
very
gutter
as
we
wended
hand
in
hand
i
had
written
before
for
the
papers
but
so
was
i
grown
that
none
of
them
now
would
have
me
that
could
pay
me
and
the
worst
seemed
closing
around
us
when
as
it
needs
must
chance
i
spoke
at
some
radical
club
of
the
great
revolution
in
france
indeed
i
said
nothing
new
to
those
who
had
learned
it
all
and
yet
as
something
strange
on
some
of
the
folk
did
it
fall
it
was
late
in
the
terrible
war
and
france
to
the
end
drew
nigh
and
some
of
us
stood
agape
to
see
how
the
war
would
die
and
what
would
spring
from
its
ashes
so
when
the
talk
was
and
after
the
stir
and
excitement
i
felt
the
burden
i
bore
heavier
yet
for
it
all
there
came
to
speak
to
me
a
serious
man
a
young
i
could
see
and
we
fell
to
talk
together
and
he
shyly
gave
me
praise
and
asked
though
scarcely
in
words
of
my
past
and
my
well
there
let
it
all
out
and
i
flushed
as
i
strode
along
for
we
were
walking
by
now
and
bitterly
spoke
of
the
wrong
maybe
i
taught
him
something
but
ready
he
was
to
learn
and
had
come
to
our
workmen
meetings
some
knowledge
of
men
to
learn
he
kindled
afresh
at
my
words
although
to
try
him
i
spake
more
roughly
than
i
was
wont
but
every
word
did
he
take
for
what
it
was
really
worth
nor
even
laughter
he
spared
as
though
he
would
look
on
life
of
its
rags
of
habit
bared
well
why
should
i
be
ashamed
that
he
helped
me
at
my
need
my
wife
and
my
child
must
i
kill
them
and
the
man
was
a
friend
indeed
and
the
work
that
he
got
me
i
did
it
was
writing
you
understand
as
well
as
another
might
do
it
to
be
short
he
joined
our
band
before
many
days
were
over
and
we
saw
him
everywhere
that
we
workmen
met
together
though
i
brought
him
not
to
my
lair
eager
he
grew
for
the
cause
and
we
twain
grew
friend
and
friend
he
was
dainty
of
mind
and
of
body
most
brave
as
he
showed
in
the
end
merry
despite
of
his
sadness
and
speedy
to
see
like
a
perfect
knight
of
old
time
as
the
poets
would
have
them
to
be
that
was
the
friend
that
i
won
by
my
bitter
speech
at
last
he
loved
me
he
grieved
my
soul
now
the
love
and
the
grief
are
past
he
is
gone
with
his
eager
learning
his
sadness
and
his
mirth
his
hope
and
his
fond
desire
there
is
no
such
thing
on
the
earth
he
died
not
unbeloved
maybe
betwixt
my
life
and
his
longing
there
rolls
a
boundless
sea
and
what
are
those
memories
now
to
all
that
i
have
to
do
the
deeds
to
be
done
so
many
the
days
of
my
life
so
few
x
ready
to
depart
i
said
of
my
friend
that
at
first
he
saw
not
my
lair
yet
he
and
i
and
my
wife
were
together
here
and
there
and
at
last
as
my
work
increased
and
my
den
to
a
dwelling
grew
he
came
there
often
enough
and
yet
more
together
we
drew
then
came
a
change
in
the
man
for
a
month
he
kept
away
then
came
again
and
was
with
us
for
a
fortnight
every
day
but
often
he
sat
there
silent
which
was
little
his
wont
with
us
and
at
first
i
had
no
inkling
of
what
constrained
him
thus
i
might
have
thought
that
he
faltered
but
now
and
again
there
came
when
we
spoke
of
the
cause
and
its
doings
a
flash
of
his
eager
flame
and
he
seemed
himself
for
a
while
then
the
brightness
would
fade
away
and
he
gloomed
and
shrank
from
my
eyes
thus
passed
day
after
day
and
grieved
i
grew
and
i
pondered
till
at
last
one
eve
we
sat
in
the
room
together
and
talked
of
this
and
that
but
chiefly
indeed
of
the
war
and
what
would
come
of
it
for
paris
drew
near
to
its
fall
and
wild
hopes
to
flit
amidst
us
communist
folk
and
we
talked
of
what
might
be
done
when
the
germans
had
gone
their
ways
and
the
two
were
left
alone
betrayers
and
betrayed
in
wasted
france
as
i
spoke
the
word
my
eyes
met
his
in
a
glance
and
swiftly
he
turned
away
then
back
with
a
steady
gaze
he
turned
on
me
and
it
seemed
as
when
a
plays
round
the
sword
in
a
beginning
and
the
coming
on
of
strife
for
i
knew
though
he
looked
on
me
he
saw
not
me
but
my
wife
and
he
reddened
up
to
the
brow
and
the
tumult
of
the
blood
nigh
blinded
my
eyes
for
a
while
that
i
scarce
saw
bad
or
good
till
i
knew
that
he
was
arisen
and
had
gone
without
a
word
then
i
turned
about
unto
her
and
a
quivering
voice
i
heard
like
music
without
a
meaning
and
twice
i
heard
my
name
richard
richard
she
said
and
her
arms
about
me
came
and
her
tears
and
the
lips
that
i
loved
were
on
my
face
once
more
a
while
i
clung
to
her
body
and
longing
sweet
and
sore
beguiled
my
heart
of
its
sorrow
then
we
sundered
and
sore
she
wept
while
fair
pictures
of
days
departed
about
my
sad
heart
crept
and
mazed
i
felt
and
weary
but
we
sat
apart
again
not
speaking
while
between
us
was
the
sharp
and
bitter
pain
as
the
sword
the
lovers
bewildered
in
the
fruitless
marriage
bed
yet
a
while
and
we
spoke
together
and
i
scarce
knew
what
i
said
but
it
was
not
wrath
or
reproaching
or
the
chill
of
hate
for
belike
around
and
about
us
we
felt
the
brooding
fate
we
were
gentle
and
kind
together
and
if
any
had
seen
us
so
they
had
said
two
are
one
in
the
face
of
all
trouble
and
but
indeed
as
a
wedded
couple
we
shrank
from
the
eyes
of
men
as
we
dwelt
together
and
pondered
on
the
days
that
come
not
again
days
passed
and
we
dwelt
together
nor
arthur
came
for
awhile
gravely
it
was
and
sadly
and
with
no
greeting
smile
that
we
twain
met
at
our
meetings
but
no
growth
of
hate
was
yet
though
my
heart
at
first
would
be
sinking
as
our
thoughts
and
our
eyes
they
met
and
when
he
spake
amidst
us
and
as
one
we
two
agreed
and
i
knew
of
his
faith
and
his
wisdom
then
sore
was
my
heart
indeed
we
shrank
from
meeting
alone
for
the
words
we
had
to
say
our
thoughts
would
nowise
yet
for
many
a
day
unhappy
days
of
all
days
yet
o
might
they
come
again
so
sore
as
my
longing
returneth
to
their
trouble
and
sorrow
and
pain
but
time
passed
and
once
we
were
sitting
my
wife
and
i
in
our
room
and
it
was
in
the
london
twilight
and
the
february
gloom
when
there
came
a
knock
and
he
entered
all
pale
though
bright
were
his
eyes
and
i
knew
that
something
had
happened
and
my
heart
to
my
mouth
did
arise
is
over
he
said
beginning
for
paris
has
fallen
at
last
and
who
knows
what
next
shall
happen
after
all
that
has
happened
and
passed
there
now
may
we
all
be
i
took
up
the
word
then
let
us
go
we
three
together
and
there
to
die
like
he
said
live
and
be
happy
like
then
he
flushed
up
red
and
she
no
less
as
she
hearkened
as
one
thought
through
their
bodies
had
sped
then
i
reached
out
my
hand
unto
him
and
i
kissed
her
once
on
the
brow
but
no
word
craving
forgiveness
and
no
word
of
pardon
now
our
minds
for
our
mouths
might
fashion
in
the
february
gloom
and
into
the
dark
we
sat
planning
and
there
was
i
in
the
room
and
in
speech
i
gave
and
i
took
but
yet
alone
and
apart
in
the
fields
where
i
once
was
a
youngling
whiles
wandered
the
thoughts
of
my
heart
and
whiles
in
the
unseen
paris
and
the
streets
made
ready
for
war
night
grew
and
we
lit
the
candles
and
we
drew
together
more
and
whiles
we
differed
a
little
as
we
settled
what
to
do
and
my
soul
was
cleared
of
confusion
as
nigher
the
drew
well
i
took
my
child
into
the
country
as
we
had
settled
there
and
gave
him
to
be
cherished
by
a
kindly
care
a
friend
of
my
but
younger
and
for
arthur
i
let
him
give
his
money
as
mine
was
but
little
that
the
boy
might
flourish
and
live
lest
we
three
or
i
and
arthur
should
perish
in
tumult
and
war
and
at
least
the
face
of
his
father
he
should
look
on
never
more
you
cry
out
shame
on
my
honour
but
yet
remember
again
that
a
man
in
my
boy
was
growing
must
my
passing
pride
and
pain
undo
the
manhood
within
him
and
his
days
and
their
doings
blight
so
i
thrust
my
pride
away
and
i
did
what
i
deemed
was
right
and
left
him
down
in
our
country
and
well
may
you
think
indeed
how
my
sad
heart
swelled
at
departing
from
the
peace
of
river
and
mead
but
i
held
all
sternly
aback
and
again
to
the
town
did
i
pass
and
as
alone
i
journeyed
this
was
ever
in
my
heart
may
die
they
may
live
and
be
happy
but
for
me
i
know
my
part
in
paris
to
do
my
utmost
and
there
in
paris
to
die
and
i
said
day
of
the
deeds
and
the
day
of
deliverance
is
xi
a
glimpse
of
the
coming
day
it
was
strange
indeed
that
journey
never
yet
had
i
crossed
the
sea
or
looked
on
another
people
than
the
folk
that
had
fostered
me
and
my
heart
rose
up
and
fluttered
as
in
the
misty
night
we
came
on
the
fleet
of
the
fishers
slow
rolling
in
the
light
of
the
hidden
moon
as
the
sea
dim
under
the
false
dawn
lay
and
so
like
shadows
of
ships
through
the
night
they
faded
away
and
calais
pier
was
upon
us
dreamlike
it
was
indeed
as
we
sat
in
the
train
together
and
toward
the
end
made
speed
but
a
dull
sleep
came
upon
me
and
through
the
sleep
a
dream
of
the
frenchman
who
once
was
my
master
by
the
side
of
the
willowy
stream
and
he
talked
and
told
me
tales
of
the
war
unwaged
as
yet
and
the
victory
never
won
and
bade
me
never
forget
while
i
walked
on
still
unhappy
by
the
home
of
the
perch
till
at
last
with
a
flash
of
light
and
a
rattle
and
lurch
i
woke
up
dazed
and
witless
till
my
sorrow
awoke
again
and
the
grey
of
the
morn
was
upon
us
as
we
sped
through
the
poplar
plain
by
the
brimming
streams
and
the
houses
with
their
grey
roofs
warped
and
bent
and
the
horseless
plough
in
the
furrow
and
things
fair
and
innocent
and
there
sat
my
wife
before
me
and
she
too
dreamed
as
she
slept
for
the
slow
tears
fell
from
her
eyelids
as
in
her
sleep
she
wept
but
arthur
sat
by
my
side
and
waked
and
flushed
was
his
face
and
his
eyes
were
quick
to
behold
the
picture
of
each
fair
place
that
we
flashed
by
as
on
we
hurried
and
i
knew
that
the
joy
of
life
was
strongly
stirred
within
him
by
the
thought
of
the
coming
strife
then
i
too
thought
for
a
little
it
is
good
in
despite
it
is
good
to
see
pictures
and
so
live
in
the
day
and
the
light
yea
we
deemed
that
to
death
we
were
hastening
and
it
made
our
vision
clear
and
we
knew
the
delight
of
our
and
held
their
sorrow
dear
but
now
when
we
came
unto
paris
and
were
out
in
the
sun
and
the
street
it
was
strange
to
see
the
faces
that
our
wondering
eyes
did
meet
such
joy
and
peace
and
pleasure
that
folk
were
glad
we
knew
but
knew
not
the
why
and
the
wherefore
and
we
who
had
just
come
through
the
vanquished
land
and
and
there
at
denis
now
had
seen
the
german
soldiers
and
heard
their
bugles
blow
and
the
drum
and
fife
go
rattling
through
the
freshness
of
the
yet
here
we
beheld
all
joyous
the
folk
they
had
made
forlorn
so
at
last
from
a
grey
stone
building
we
saw
a
great
flag
fly
one
colour
red
and
solemn
the
blue
of
the
sky
and
we
stopped
and
turned
to
each
other
and
as
each
at
each
did
we
gaze
the
hope
enwrapped
us
with
joy
and
great
amaze
as
folk
in
a
dream
we
washed
and
we
ate
and
in
all
detail
oft
told
and
in
many
a
fashion
did
we
have
all
tale
how
while
we
were
threading
our
tangle
of
trouble
in
london
there
and
i
for
my
part
let
me
say
it
within
but
a
step
of
despair
in
paris
the
day
of
days
had
betid
for
the
vile
stroke
to
madden
paris
and
crush
her
had
been
struck
and
the
dull
sword
broke
there
was
now
no
foe
and
no
fool
in
the
city
and
paris
was
free
and
as
she
is
this
morning
all
france
will
be
we
heard
and
our
hearts
were
saying
a
little
while
all
the
and
that
day
at
last
of
all
days
i
knew
what
life
was
worth
for
i
saw
what
few
have
beheld
a
folk
with
all
hearts
gay
then
at
last
i
knew
indeed
that
our
word
of
the
coming
day
that
so
oft
in
grief
and
in
sorrow
i
had
preached
and
scarcely
knew
if
it
was
but
despair
of
the
present
or
the
hope
of
the
day
that
was
i
say
that
i
saw
it
now
real
solid
and
at
hand
and
strange
how
my
heart
went
back
to
our
little
nook
of
the
land
and
how
plain
and
clear
i
saw
it
as
though
i
longed
indeed
to
give
it
a
share
of
the
joy
and
the
satisfaction
of
need
that
here
in
the
folk
i
beheld
for
this
in
our
country
spring
did
the
starlings
bechatter
the
gables
and
the
thrush
in
the
sing
and
the
green
cloud
spread
the
willows
and
the
little
children
rejoice
and
shout
midst
a
nameless
longing
to
the
mingled
voice
for
this
was
the
promise
of
and
the
new
leaves
longing
to
burst
and
the
white
roads
threading
the
acres
and
the
meadows
athirst
once
all
was
the
work
of
sorrow
and
the
life
without
reward
and
the
toil
that
fear
hath
bidden
and
the
folly
of
master
and
lord
but
now
are
all
things
changing
and
hope
without
a
fear
shall
speed
us
on
through
the
story
of
the
changes
of
the
year
now
spring
shall
pluck
the
garland
that
summer
weaves
for
all
and
autumn
spread
the
banquet
and
winter
fill
the
hall
o
earth
thou
kind
bestower
thou
ancient
fruitful
place
how
lovely
and
beloved
now
gleams
thy
happy
face
and
o
mother
mother
i
said
hadst
thou
known
as
i
lay
in
thy
lap
and
for
me
thou
hopedst
and
fearedst
on
what
days
my
life
should
hap
hadst
thou
known
of
the
death
that
i
look
for
and
the
deeds
wherein
i
should
deal
how
calm
had
been
thy
gladness
how
sweet
hadst
thou
smiled
on
my
weal
as
some
woman
of
old
hadst
thou
wondered
who
hath
brought
forth
a
god
of
the
earth
and
in
joy
that
knoweth
no
speech
she
dreams
of
the
happy
birth
yea
fair
were
those
hours
indeed
whatever
hereafter
might
come
and
they
swept
over
all
my
sorrow
and
all
thought
of
my
wildered
home
but
not
for
dreams
of
rejoicing
had
we
come
across
the
sea
that
day
we
delivered
the
letters
that
our
friends
had
given
to
me
and
we
craved
for
some
work
for
the
cause
and
what
work
was
there
indeed
but
to
learn
the
business
of
battle
and
the
manner
of
dying
at
need
we
three
could
think
of
none
other
and
we
wrought
our
best
therein
and
both
of
us
made
a
shift
the
stripes
to
win
for
diligent
were
we
indeed
and
he
as
in
all
he
did
showed
a
cheerful
ready
talent
that
nowise
might
be
hid
and
yet
hurt
the
pride
of
no
man
that
he
needs
must
step
before
but
as
for
my
wife
the
of
the
she
wore
and
gently
and
bravely
would
serve
us
and
to
all
as
a
sister
to
a
sister
amidst
of
the
alas
a
sister
to
me
xii
meeting
the
so
we
dwelt
in
the
city
as
a
very
part
of
its
life
looking
back
at
it
all
from
england
i
an
atom
of
the
strife
i
can
see
that
i
might
have
seen
what
the
end
would
be
from
the
first
the
hope
of
man
devoured
in
the
day
when
the
gods
are
athirst
but
those
days
we
lived
as
i
tell
you
a
life
that
was
not
our
own
and
we
saw
but
the
hope
of
the
world
and
the
seed
that
the
ages
had
sown
spring
up
now
a
tree
from
the
earth
lying
over
the
dead
earth
quickened
earth
kindled
to
with
the
blood
that
her
lovers
have
shed
with
the
happy
days
cast
off
for
the
sake
of
her
happy
day
with
the
love
of
women
foregone
and
the
bright
youth
worn
away
with
the
gentleness
stripped
from
the
lives
thrust
into
the
jostle
of
war
with
the
hope
of
the
hardy
heart
forever
dwindling
afar
o
earth
earth
look
on
thy
lovers
who
knew
all
thy
gifts
and
thy
gain
but
cast
them
aside
for
thy
sake
and
caught
up
barren
pain
indeed
of
some
art
thou
mindful
and
shalt
forget
their
tale
till
shrunk
are
the
floods
of
thine
ocean
and
thy
sun
is
waxen
pale
but
rather
i
bid
thee
remember
these
of
the
latter
days
who
were
fed
by
no
fair
promise
and
made
drunken
by
no
praise
for
them
no
opening
heaven
reached
out
the
crown
no
folk
delivered
wept
them
and
no
harvest
of
renown
they
reaped
with
the
scythe
of
battle
nor
round
their
dying
bed
did
kindly
friendly
farewell
the
dew
of
blessing
shed
in
the
sordid
streets
of
the
city
mid
a
folk
that
knew
them
not
in
the
living
death
of
the
prison
didst
thou
deal
them
out
their
lot
yet
foundest
them
deeds
to
be
doing
and
no
feeble
folk
were
they
to
scowl
on
their
own
undoing
and
wail
their
lives
away
but
oft
were
they
blithe
and
merry
and
deft
from
the
strife
to
wring
some
joy
that
others
gained
not
midst
their
peaceful
wayfaring
so
fared
they
giftless
ever
and
no
help
of
fortune
sought
their
life
was
thy
deliverance
o
earth
and
for
thee
they
fought
mid
the
jeers
of
the
happy
and
deedless
mid
failing
friends
they
went
to
their
foredoomed
fruitful
ending
on
the
love
of
thee
intent
yea
and
we
were
a
part
of
it
all
the
beginning
of
the
end
that
first
fight
of
the
uttermost
battle
whither
all
the
nations
wend
and
yet
could
i
tell
you
its
story
you
might
think
it
little
and
mean
for
few
of
you
now
will
be
thinking
of
the
day
that
might
have
been
and
fewer
still
meseemeth
of
the
day
that
yet
shall
be
that
shall
light
up
that
first
beginning
and
its
tangled
misery
for
indeed
a
very
machine
is
the
war
that
now
men
wage
nor
have
we
hold
of
its
handle
we
gulled
of
our
heritage
we
workmen
slaves
of
machines
well
it
ground
us
small
enough
this
machine
of
the
beaten
bourgeois
though
oft
the
work
was
rough
that
it
turned
out
for
its
money
like
other
young
soldiers
at
first
i
scarcely
knew
the
wherefore
why
our
side
had
had
the
worst
for
man
to
man
and
in
knots
we
faced
the
matter
well
and
i
thought
well
or
next
day
a
new
tale
will
be
to
tell
i
was
fierce
and
not
afraid
yet
o
were
the
fair
and
the
crofts
and
the
sunny
gardens
though
death
they
harboured
there
and
few
but
fools
are
fain
of
leaving
the
world
outright
and
the
story
over
and
done
and
an
end
of
the
life
and
the
light
no
hatred
of
life
thou
knowest
o
earth
mid
the
bullets
i
bore
though
pain
and
grief
oppressed
me
that
i
never
may
suffer
more
but
in
those
days
past
over
did
life
and
death
seem
one
yea
the
life
had
we
attained
to
which
could
never
be
undone
you
would
have
me
tell
of
the
fighting
well
you
know
it
was
new
to
me
yet
it
soon
seemed
as
if
it
had
been
for
ever
and
ever
would
be
the
morn
when
we
made
that
sally
some
thought
and
yet
not
i
that
a
few
days
and
all
would
be
over
just
a
few
had
got
to
die
and
the
rest
would
be
happy
thenceforward
but
my
stubborn
country
blood
was
bidding
me
hold
my
halloo
till
we
were
out
of
the
wood
and
that
was
the
reason
perhaps
why
little
disheartened
i
was
as
we
stood
all
huddled
together
that
night
in
a
helpless
mass
as
beaten
men
are
wont
and
i
knew
enough
of
war
to
know
midst
its
unskilled
labour
what
slips
full
often
are
there
was
arthur
unhurt
beside
me
and
my
wife
come
back
again
and
surely
that
eve
between
us
there
was
love
though
no
lack
of
pain
as
we
talked
all
the
matter
over
and
our
hearts
spake
more
than
our
lips
and
we
said
shall
learn
we
shall
from
disasters
and
well
many
a
thing
we
learned
but
we
learned
not
how
to
prevail
the
brutal
the
ruthless
grinder
of
bale
by
the
bourgeois
world
it
was
made
for
the
bourgeois
world
and
we
we
were
as
the
village
weaver
the
maybe
it
drew
on
nearer
and
nearer
and
we
to
look
to
the
we
three
at
our
lives
began
with
death
to
blend
though
we
were
long
i
dwell
on
yet
as
a
ghost
in
the
land
where
we
once
were
happy
to
look
on
the
loved
and
the
lost
xiii
the
ending
how
can
i
tell
you
the
story
of
the
hope
and
its
defence
we
wrought
in
a
narrow
circle
it
was
hither
and
thither
and
thence
to
the
walls
and
back
for
a
little
to
the
fort
and
there
to
abide
and
boys
and
women
they
lived
they
died
nor
counted
much
in
the
story
i
have
heard
it
told
since
then
and
mere
lies
our
deeds
have
turned
to
in
the
mouths
of
happy
men
and
those
will
be
soon
forgotten
as
the
world
wends
on
its
way
too
busy
for
truth
or
kindness
yet
my
soul
is
seeing
the
day
when
those
who
are
now
but
children
the
new
generation
shall
be
and
in
our
land
of
commerce
and
the
workshop
over
the
sea
amid
them
shall
spring
up
the
story
yea
the
very
breath
of
the
air
to
the
yearning
hearts
of
the
workers
true
tale
of
it
all
shall
bear
year
after
year
shall
men
meet
with
the
red
flag
over
head
and
shall
call
on
the
help
of
the
vanquished
and
the
kindness
of
the
dead
and
time
that
weareth
most
things
and
the
years
that
overgrow
the
tale
of
the
fools
triumphant
yet
clearer
and
clearer
shall
show
the
deeds
of
the
helpers
of
menfolk
to
every
age
and
clime
the
deeds
of
the
cursed
and
the
conquered
that
were
wise
before
their
time
of
these
were
my
wife
and
my
friend
there
they
ended
their
wayfaring
like
the
generations
before
them
thick
thronging
as
leaves
of
the
spring
fast
falling
as
leaves
of
the
autumn
as
the
ancient
singer
hath
said
and
each
one
with
a
love
and
a
story
ah
the
grief
of
the
early
dead
is
all
this
talk
you
are
saying
all
this
long
delay
yes
indeed
it
is
hard
in
the
telling
of
things
too
grievous
to
say
i
would
be
but
can
not
be
silent
well
i
hurry
on
to
the
for
it
drew
to
the
latter
ending
of
the
hope
that
we
helped
to
defend
the
forts
were
gone
and
the
foemen
drew
near
to
the
wall
and
it
wanted
not
many
hours
to
the
last
hour
and
the
fall
and
we
lived
amid
the
bullets
and
seldom
went
away
to
what
as
yet
were
the
streets
by
or
by
day
we
three
we
fought
together
and
i
did
the
best
i
could
too
busy
to
think
of
the
ending
but
arthur
was
better
than
good
resourceful
keen
and
eager
from
post
to
post
he
ran
to
thrust
out
aught
that
was
moving
and
bring
up
the
uttermost
man
he
was
gone
on
some
such
errand
and
was
absent
a
little
space
when
i
turned
about
for
a
moment
and
saw
my
fair
face
and
her
foot
set
firm
on
the
rampart
as
she
hastened
here
and
there
to
some
of
our
wounded
comrades
such
help
as
she
could
to
bear
then
straight
she
looked
upon
me
with
such
lovely
friendly
eyes
of
the
days
gone
by
and
remembered
that
up
from
my
heart
rise
the
choking
sobbing
passion
but
i
kept
it
aback
and
smiled
and
waved
my
hand
therewith
her
face
turned
wild
in
a
moment
of
time
and
she
stared
along
the
length
of
the
wall
and
i
saw
a
man
who
was
running
and
crouching
stagger
and
fall
and
knew
it
for
arthur
at
once
but
voiceless
toward
him
she
ran
i
with
her
crying
aloud
but
or
ever
we
reached
the
man
lo
a
roar
and
a
crash
around
us
and
my
sick
brain
whirling
around
and
a
white
light
turning
to
black
and
no
sky
and
no
air
and
no
ground
and
then
what
i
needs
must
tell
of
as
a
great
blank
but
indeed
no
words
to
tell
of
its
horror
hath
language
for
my
need
as
a
map
is
to
a
picture
so
is
all
that
my
words
can
say
but
when
i
came
to
myself
in
a
house
sick
i
lay
amid
strange
blended
noises
and
my
own
mind
wandering
there
delirium
in
me
indeed
and
around
me
everywhere
that
passed
and
all
things
grew
calmer
i
with
them
all
the
stress
that
the
last
three
months
had
been
on
me
now
sank
to
helplessness
i
bettered
and
then
they
told
me
the
tale
of
what
had
betid
and
first
that
under
the
name
of
a
friend
of
theirs
i
was
hid
who
was
slain
by
mere
misadventure
and
was
english
as
was
i
and
no
rebel
and
had
due
papers
wherewith
i
might
well
slip
by
when
i
was
somewhat
better
then
i
knew
though
they
had
not
told
how
all
was
fallen
together
and
my
heart
grew
sick
and
cold
and
yet
indeed
thenceforward
i
strove
my
life
to
live
that
as
i
was
and
so
hapless
i
yet
might
live
to
strive
it
was
but
few
words
they
told
me
of
that
murder
great
and
grim
and
how
with
the
blood
of
the
guiltless
the
streets
did
swim
and
of
other
horrors
they
told
not
except
in
a
word
or
two
when
they
told
of
their
scheme
to
save
me
from
the
hands
of
the
villainous
crew
whereby
i
guessed
what
was
happening
in
the
main
without
detail
and
so
at
last
it
came
to
their
telling
the
other
tale
of
my
wife
and
my
friend
though
that
also
methought
i
knew
too
well
well
they
said
that
i
had
been
wounded
by
the
fragment
of
a
shell
another
of
which
had
slain
her
outright
as
forth
she
ran
toward
arthur
struck
by
a
bullet
she
never
touched
the
man
alive
and
she
also
alive
but
thereafter
as
they
lay
both
dead
on
one
litter
together
then
folk
who
knew
not
us
but
were
moved
by
seeing
the
twain
so
fair
and
so
piteous
took
them
for
husband
and
wife
who
were
fated
there
to
die
or
it
may
be
lover
and
lover
what
know
i
well
you
know
that
i
from
paris
and
crossed
the
narrow
sea
and
made
my
way
to
the
country
where
we
twain
were
wont
to
be
and
that
is
the
last
and
the
latest
of
the
tale
i
have
to
tell
i
came
not
here
to
be
bidding
my
happiness
farewell
and
to
nurse
my
grief
and
to
win
me
the
gain
of
a
wounded
life
that
because
of
the
bygone
sorrow
may
hide
away
from
the
strife
i
came
to
look
to
my
son
and
myself
to
get
stout
and
strong
that
two
men
there
might
be
hereafter
to
battle
against
the
wrong
and
i
cling
to
the
love
of
the
past
and
the
love
of
the
day
to
be
and
the
present
it
is
but
the
building
of
the
man
to
be
strong
in
me
chants
for
socialists
the
day
is
coming
come
hither
lads
and
hearken
for
a
tale
there
is
to
tell
of
the
wonderful
days
when
all
shall
be
better
than
well
and
the
tale
shall
be
told
of
a
country
a
land
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
and
folk
shall
call
it
england
in
the
days
that
are
going
to
be
there
more
than
one
in
a
thousand
in
the
days
that
are
yet
to
come
shall
have
some
hope
of
the
morrow
some
joy
of
the
ancient
home
for
not
but
listen
to
this
strange
tale
of
all
folk
that
are
in
england
shall
be
better
lodged
than
swine
then
a
man
shall
work
and
bethink
him
and
rejoice
in
the
deeds
of
his
hand
nor
yet
come
home
in
the
even
too
faint
and
weary
to
stand
men
in
that
time
shall
work
and
have
no
fear
for
lack
of
earning
and
the
anear
i
tell
you
this
for
a
wonder
that
no
man
then
shall
be
glad
of
his
fall
and
mishap
to
snatch
at
the
work
he
had
for
that
which
the
worker
winneth
shall
then
be
his
indeed
nor
shall
half
be
reaped
for
nothing
by
him
that
sowed
no
seed
o
strange
new
wonderful
justice
but
for
whom
shall
we
gather
the
gain
for
ourselves
and
for
each
of
our
fellows
and
no
hand
shall
labour
in
vain
then
all
mine
and
all
thine
shall
be
ours
and
no
more
shall
any
man
crave
for
riches
that
serve
for
nothing
but
to
fetter
a
friend
for
a
slave
and
what
wealth
then
shall
be
left
us
when
none
shall
gather
gold
to
buy
his
friend
in
the
market
and
pinch
and
pine
the
sold
nay
what
save
the
lovely
city
and
the
little
house
on
the
hill
and
the
wastes
and
the
woodland
beauty
and
the
happy
fields
we
till
and
the
homes
of
ancient
stories
the
tombs
of
the
mighty
dead
and
the
wise
men
seeking
out
marvels
and
the
teeming
head
and
the
hand
of
wonder
and
the
marvellous
and
the
banded
choirs
of
music
all
those
that
do
and
know
for
all
these
shall
be
ours
and
all
nor
shall
any
lack
a
share
of
the
toil
and
the
gain
of
living
in
the
days
when
the
world
grows
fair
ah
such
are
the
days
that
shall
be
but
what
are
the
deeds
of
in
the
days
of
the
years
we
dwell
in
that
wear
our
lives
away
why
then
and
for
what
are
we
waiting
there
are
three
words
to
speak
we
will
it
and
what
is
the
foeman
but
the
wakened
and
weak
o
why
and
for
what
are
we
waiting
while
our
brothers
droop
and
die
and
on
every
wind
of
the
heavens
a
wasted
life
goes
by
how
long
shall
they
reproach
us
where
crowd
on
crowd
they
dwell
poor
ghosts
of
the
wicked
city
the
hungry
hell
through
squalid
life
they
laboured
in
sordid
grief
they
died
those
sons
of
a
mighty
mother
those
props
of
pride
they
are
gone
there
is
none
can
undo
it
nor
save
our
souls
from
the
curse
but
many
a
million
cometh
and
shall
they
be
better
or
worse
it
is
we
must
answer
and
hasten
and
open
wide
the
door
for
the
rich
hurrying
terror
and
the
hope
of
the
poor
yea
the
voiceless
wrath
of
the
wretched
and
their
unlearned
discontent
we
must
give
it
voice
and
wisdom
till
the
be
spent
come
then
since
all
things
call
us
the
living
and
the
dead
and
the
weltering
tangle
a
glimmering
light
is
shed
come
then
let
us
cast
off
fooling
and
put
by
ease
and
rest
for
the
cause
alone
is
worthy
till
the
good
days
bring
the
best
come
join
in
the
only
battle
wherein
no
man
can
fail
where
whoso
fadeth
and
dieth
yet
his
deed
shall
still
prevail
ah
come
cast
off
all
fooling
for
this
at
least
we
know
that
the
dawn
and
the
day
is
coming
and
forth
the
banners
go
the
voice
of
toil
i
heard
men
saying
leave
hope
and
praying
all
days
shall
be
as
all
have
been
and
bring
fear
and
sorrow
the
toil
between
when
earth
was
younger
mid
toil
and
hunger
in
hope
we
strove
and
our
hands
were
strong
then
great
men
led
us
with
words
they
fed
us
and
bade
us
right
the
earthly
wrong
go
read
in
story
their
deeds
and
glory
their

faster
our
iron
master
the
thing
we
made
for
ever
drives
bids
us
grind
treasure
and
fashion
pleasure
for
other
hopes
and
other
lives
where
home
is
a
hovel

dull
we
grovel
forgetting
that
the
world
is
fair
where
no
babe
we
cherish
lest
its
very
soul
perish
where
our
mirth
is
crime
our
love
a
snare
who
now
shall
lead
us
what
god
shall
heed
us
as
we
lie
in
the
hell
our
hands
have
won
for
us
are
no

fools

befoolers
the

gone
i
heard
men
saying
leave
tears
and
praying
the
sharp
knife
heedeth
not
the
sheep
are
we
not
stronger
than
the
rich
and
the
wronger
when
day
breaks
over
dreams

come
shoulder

ere
the

grows
older
help
lies
in
nought
but
thee

tarry

of
slaves
long
passed
away
for
us
hath
forged
the
chain
till
now
each

day
builds
up
the
house

pain
and
we
shall
we
too
crouch
and
quail
ashamed
afraid
of
strife
and
lest
our
lives
untimely
fail
embrace
the
death
in

yesterday
they

last
of

the
valiant
dead
the
tidings
we
are
telling
was
the
tale
they
had
to
tell
the
hope
that
our
hearts
cherish
was
the
hope
for
which
they
fell
in
the
grave
where
tyrants
thrust
them

their
labour
and
their
pain
but
undying
from

springeth
up
the
hope
again
mourn
not
therefore
nor
lament
it
that
the
world
outlives
their
life
voice
and
vision
yet
they
give
us
making
strong
our
hands
for
strife
some
had
name

fame
and
honour
they
were

wise
and
strong
some
were
nameless
poor
unlettered
weak
in

grief

us

happy
happy
ye
that
ye
were

are
merry
ere
the
sunlight
leaves
the
earth
and
they
bless
the
day
beloved
all
too
short
for
all
their
mirth
some
shall
pause
awhile
and
ponder
on
the
bitter
days
of
old
ere
the
toil
of
strife
and
battle
overthrew
the
curse
of
gold
then

of
loved

solemn
thoughts
of

shall
rise
we
who
once
were
fools
and
dreamers
then
shall
be
the
brave
and
wise
there
amidst
the
world
shall
our
earthly
deeds
abide
though
our
names
be
all
forgotten
and
the
tale
of
how
we
died
life
or
death
then
who
shall
heed
it
what
we
gain

what
we
lose

the
message

we
asked
them
for
a

of
toilsome
earning
they
bade
us
bide
their
leisure
for
our
bread
we
craved
to
speak
to
tell
our
woeful
learning
we
come
back
speechless
bearing
back
our
dead
thousands
must
they
one
and
all
if
they
would
dusk
the
they
will
not
learn
they
have
no
ears
to
hearken
they
turn
their
faces
from
the
eyes
of
fate
their
halls
shut
out
the
skies
that
darken
but
lo
this
dead
man
knocking
at
the
gate
thousands
must
they
one
and

the
here
lies
the
sign
that
we
shall
break
our
prison
amidst
the
storm
he
won
a
rest
but
in
the
cloudy
dawn
the
sun
arisen
brings
us
our
day
of
work
to
win
the
best
thousands
must
they
one
and
all
if
they
would
dusk
the
may
day
the
workers
o
earth
once
again
cometh
spring
to
deliver
thy
heart
o
thou
friend
of
the
sun
fair
blossom
the
meadows
from
river
to
river
and
the
birds
sing
their
triumph
winter
undone
o
earth
how
thou
singest
thy
labour
and
upholdest
the
cup
of
thy
bliss
as
when
in
the
drinks
neighbour
to
neighbour
and
all
words
are
gleeful
and
nought
is
amiss
but
we
we
o
mother
through
long
generations
we
have
toiled
and
been
fruitful
but
never
with
thee
might
we
raise
up
our
bowed
heads
and
cry
to
the
nations
to
look
on
our
beauty
and
hearken
our
glee
unlovely
of
aspect
and
on
the
fair
pageant
all
we
gaze
of
thy
fairness
we
fashion
a
dreary
and
in
sorrow
wear
over
each
day
of
our
days
the
earth
o
children
o
toilers
what
foemen
beleaguer
the
house
i
have
built
you
the
home
i
have
won
full
great
are
my
gifts
and
my
hands
are
all
eager
to
fill
every
heart
with
the
deeds
i
have
done
the
workers
the
foemen
are
born
of
thy
body
o
mother
in
our
shape
are
they
shapen
their
voice
is
the
same
and
the
thought
of
their
hearts
is
as
ours
and
no
other
it
is
they
of
our
own
house
that
bring
us
to
shame
the
earth
are
ye
few
are
they
many
what
words
have
ye
spoken
to
bid
your
own
brethren
remember
the
earth
what
deeds
have
ye
done
that
the
bonds
should
be
broken
and
men
dwell
together
in
and
mirth
the
workers
they
are
few
we
are
many
and
yet
o
our
mother
many
years
were
we
wordless
and
nought
was
our
deed
but
now
the
word
flitteth
from
brother
to
brother
we
have
furrowed
the
acres
and
scattered
the
seed
the
earth
win
on
then
unyielding
through
fair
and
foul
weather
and
pass
not
a
day
that
your
deed
shall
avail
and
in
hope
every
come
gather
together
that
unto
the
earth
ye
may
tell
all
your
tale
then
this
shall
i
promise
that
i
am
abiding
the
day
of
your
triumph
the
ending
of
gloom
and
no
wealth
that
ye
will
then
my
hand
shall
be
hiding
and
the
tears
of
the
spring
into
roses
shall
bloom
may
day
clad
is
the
year
in
all
her
best
the
land
is
sweet

now
spring
with
summer
at
her
breast
goes
down
the
meadows
green
here
are
we
met
to
welcome
in
the
young
abounding
year
to
praise
what
she
would
have
us
win
ere
winter
draweth
near
for
surely
all
is
not
in
vain
this
gallant
show
she
brings
but
seal
of
hope
and
sign
of
gain
beareth
this
spring
of
springs
no
longer
now
the
seasons
wear
dull
without
any
tale
of
how
the
chain
the
toilers
bear
is
growing
thin
and
frail
but
hope
of
plenty
and
goodwill
flies
forth
from
land
to
land
nor
any
now
the
voice
can
still
that
crieth
on
the
hand
a
little
while
shall
spring
come
back
and
find
the
ancient
home
yet
marred
by
foolish
waste
and
lack
and
most
enthralled
by
some
a
little
while
and
then
at
last
shall
the
greetings
of
the
year
be
blent
with
wonder
of
the
past
and
all
the
griefs
that
were
a
little
while
and
they
that
meet
the
living
year
to
praise
shall
be
to
them
as
music
sweet
that
grief
of
days
so
be
we
merry
to
our
best
