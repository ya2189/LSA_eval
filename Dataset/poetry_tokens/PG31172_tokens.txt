these
selections
from
old
english
poetry
have
been
translated
to
meet
the
needs
of
that
body
of
students
who
can
not
read
the
poems
in
their
original
form
but
who
wish
nevertheless
to
enjoy
to
some
extent
the
heritage
of
verse
which
our
early
english
ancestors
have
left
for
us
especially
in
the
rapid
survey
of
english
literature
given
in
most
of
our
colleges
a
collection
of
translations
covering
the
period
and
reflecting
the
form
and
spirit
of
the
original
poems
should
add
much
to
a
fuller
appreciation
of
the
varied
and
rich
though
uneven
literary
output
of
our
earliest
singers
in
these
old
english
poems
are
full
of
the
keenest
interest
to
students
of
history
of
customs
of
legend
of
and
of
art
they
form
a
truly
national
literature
so
that
one
who
has
read
them
all
has
learned
much
not
only
of
the
life
of
the
early
english
but
of
the
feelings
that
inspired
these
folk
of
their
hopes
their
fears
and
their
superstitions
of
their
whole
outlook
on
life
they
took
their
poetry
seriously
as
they
did
everything
about
them
and
often
in
spite
of
crudity
of
expression
of
narrow
vision
and
of
conventionalized
modes
of
speech
this
very
high
seriousness
raises
an
otherwise
mediocre
poem
to
the
level
of
real
literature
whatever
may
be
said
of
the
limitations
of
old
english
poetry
of
its
lack
of
humor
of
the
narrow
range
of
its
sentiments
of
the
imitativeness
of
many
of
its
most
representative
specimens
it
can
not
be
denied
the
name
of
real
literature
for
it
is
the
direct
expression
of
the
civilization
that
gave
it
birth
a
civilization
that
we
must
understand
if
we
are
to
appreciate
the
characteristics
of
its
more
important
descendants
of
our
own
time
although
the
contents
of
these
poems
can
be
satisfactorily
studied
in
any
translation
the
effect
of
the
peculiar
meter
that
reinforces
the
stirring
spirit
of
old
english
poetry
is
lost
unless
an
attempt
is
made
to
reproduce
this
metrical
form
in
the
modern
english
rendering
the
possibility
of
retaining
the
original
meter
in
an
adequate
translation
was
formerly
the
subject
of
much
debate
but
since

and
other
recent
successful
translations
of

the
old
english
meter
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
possibility
of
putting
poems
into
readable
english
verse
that
reproduces
in
large
measure
the
effect
of
the
original
to
do
this
for
the
principal
old
english
poems
with
the
exception
of
is
the
purpose
of
the
present
volume
except
for
the
subtlest
distinctions
between
the
types
of
half
verse
strict
old
english
rules
for
the
alliterative
meter
have
been
adhered
to
these
rules
may
be
stated
as
follows
the
lines
are
divided
into
two
the
division
being
indicated
by
a
space
in
the
middle
the
consist
of
two
accented
and
a
varying
number
of
unaccented
syllables
each
contains
at
least
four
syllables
occasional
are
lengthened
to
three
accented
syllables
possibly
for
the
purpose
of
producing
an
effect
of
solemnity
the
two
are
bound
together
by
or
alliteration
an
agreement
in
sound
between
the
beginning
letters
of
any
accented
syllables
in
the
line
for
example
in
the
line
there
me
a
jewel
the
form
the
alliteration
the
third
accent
sets
the
alliteration
for
the
line
and
is
known
as
the
with
it
agree
the
first
and
the
second
accent
or
either
of
them
the
fourth
accent
must
not
however
agree
with
the
occasionally
the
first
and
third
accents
will
alliterate
together
and
the
second
and
fourth
as
the
in
against
has
no
or
the
first
and
fourth
may
have
the
alliteration
on
one
letter
while
the
second
and
third
have
it
on
another
as
then
the
of
his
these
two
latter
forms
are
somewhat
unusual
the
standard
line
is
that
given
above
there

a
jewel
or
a
generations
and
stained
with
red
or
with
rings
of
and
cups
all
consonants
alliterate
with
themselves
though
usually
and
agree
only
with
the
same
combination
vowels
alliterate
with
one
another

besides
the
distinctive
meter
in
which
the
old
english
poems
are
written
there
are
several
qualities
of
style
for
which
they
are
peculiar
no
one
can
read
a
page
of
these
poems
without
being
struck
by
the
parallel
structure
that
permeates
the
whole
body
of
old
english
verse
expressions
are
changed
slightly
and
repeated
from
a
new
point
of
view
sometimes
with
a
good
effect
but
quite
as
often
to
the
detriment
of
the
lines
these
parallelisms
have
been
retained
in
the
translation
in
so
far
as
it
has
been
possible
but
sometimes
the
lack
of
inflectional
endings
in
english
has
prevented
their
literal
translation
accompanying
these
parallelisms
and
often
a
part
of
them
are
the
frequent
synonyms
so
characteristic
of
old
english
poetry
these
synonymous
expressions
are
known
as
kennings
they
are
not
to
be
thought
of
as
occasional
metaphors
employed
at
the
whim
of
the
poet
they
had
in
most
cases
already
received
a
conventional
meaning
thus
the
king
was
always
spoken
of
as
ring
giver
protector
of
earls
or
bracelet
bestower
the
queen
was
the
weaver
of
peace
the
sea
the
ship
road
or
whale
path
or
gannet
bath
old
english
poetry
is
conventionalized
to
a
remarkable
degree
even
those
aspects
of
nature
that
the
poets
evidently
enjoyed
are
often
described
in
the
most
conventional
of
words
and
phrases
more
than
half
of
so
fine
a
poem
as
battle
of
is
taken
bodily
from
other
poems
no
description
of
a
battle
was
complete
without
a
picture
of
the
birds
of
prey
hovering
over
the
field
heroes
were
always
assembling
for
banquets
and
receiving
rewards
of
rings
at
the
hand
of
the
king
these
conventional
phrases
and
situations
added
to
a
thorough
knowledge
of
a
large
number
of
old
germanic
myths
constituted
a
great
part
of
the
equipment
of
the
typical
old
english
minstrel
or
scop
such
as
one
finds
described
in
or
it
would
be
a
mistake
however
to
conclude
that
the
poems
are
convention
and
nothing
more
a
sympathetic
reading
will
undoubtedly
show
many
high
poetic
qualities
serious
and
grave
these
poems
always
are
but
they
do
express
certain
of
the
darker
moods
with
a
sincerity
and
power
that
is
far
from
commonplace
at
times
they
give
vivid
glimpses
of
the
spirit
of
man
under
the
blighting
influence
of
the
dark
ages
after
reading
these
poems
we
come
to
understand
better
the
pessimistic
mood
of
the
author
of
when
he
says
all
on
earth
is
irksome
to
man
and
we
see
how
the
winsome
meadows
of
the
land
of
the
phoenix
must
by
their
contrast
have
delighted
the
souls
of
men
who
were
harassed
on
every
side
as
our
ancestors
were
all
of
these
distinguishing
features
of
old
english
poetry
the
regular
alliterative
meter
the
frequent
parallelisms
the
kennings
and
the
general
dark
outlook
on
life
will
be
found
illustrated
in
the
poems
selected
in
this
book
they
cover
the
entire
period
of
old
english
literature
and
embrace
every
school
the
order
in
which
the
poems
are
printed
is
in
no
sense
original
but
is
that
followed
in
most
standard
textbooks
naturally
such
artificial
divisions
as
pagan
and
christian
are
inexact
the
pagan
poems
are
only
pagan
the
christian
predominatingly
christian
on
the
whole
the
grouping
is
perhaps
accurate
enough
for
practical
purposes
and
the
conformity
to
existing
textbooks
makes
the
volume
convenient
for
those
who
wish
to
use
it
to
supplement
these
books
in
addition
to
the
poems
four
short
prose
passages
referred
to
by
most
historians
of
the
literature
have
been
included
so
as
to
add
to
the
usefulness
of
the
volume
in
the
translation
of
the
poems
the
original
meaning
and
has
been
kept
as
nearly
as
modern
english
idiom
and
the
exigencies
of
the
meter
would
allow
nowhere
we
believe
has
the
possibility
of
an
attractive
alliteration
caused
violence
to
be
done
to
the
sense
of
the
poem
the
best
diction
to
be
used
in
such
a
translation
is
difficult
to
determine
the
temptation
is
ever
present
to
use
the
modern
english
descendant
of
the
word
even
when
it
is
very
archaic
in
flavor
this
tendency
has
been
resisted
for
it
was
desired
to
reproduce
the
effect
of
the
original
and
though
old
english
poetry
was
conventional
it
was
probably
not
archaic
it
was
not
out
of
date
at
the
time
it
was
written
since
the
diction
of
these
poems
was
usually
very
simple
it
has
been
the
policy
of
the
translators
to
exclude
all
sophisticated
expressions
and
to
retain
words
of
germanic
origin
or
simple
words
of
latin
derivation
that
do
not
suggest
subtleties
foreign
to
the
mind
of
the
old
english
poet
the
texts
used
as
a
standard
for
translation
are
indicated
in
the
introductory
notes
to
the
different
poems
whenever
a
good
critical
edition
of
a
poem
has
been
available
it
has
been
followed
variations
from
the
readings
used
in
these
texts
are
usually
indicated
where
they
are
of
any
importance
in
the
punctuation
and
paragraphing
of
the
poems
the
varying
usage
of
the
different
editors
has
been
disregarded
and
a
uniform
practice
adopted
throughout
following
these
principles
the
translators
have
attempted
to
reproduce
for
modern
english
readers
the
meaning
and
movement
of
the
old
english
originals
it
is
their
earnest
hope
that
something
of
the
fine
spirit
that
breathes
through
much
of
this
poetry
will
be
found
to
remain

says
for

it

best
to

the
anglian
equivalent
of

sunilda

swanhild
that

the

the

derived

the

sends
his

him

eighth

information
as
to
the
story
is
found
in
a
number
of
continental
sources
its
best
known
treatment
is
in
a
latin
poem
by
ekkehard
of
gall
dating
from
the
first
half
of
the
tenth
century
story
is
thus
summarized
in
the
history
of
english
alphere
king
of
aquitaine
had
a
son
named
waltharius
and
heriricus
king
of
burgundy
an
only
daughter
named
hiltgund
who
was
betrothed
to
waltharius
while
they
were
yet
children
however
attila
king
of
the
huns
invaded
gaul
and
the
kings
seeing
no
hope
in
resistance
gave
up
their
children
to
him
as
hostages
together
with
much
treasure
under
like
compulsion
treasure
was
obtained
also
from
gibicho
king
of
the
franks
who
sent
as
hostage
a
youth
of
noble
birth
named
hagano
in
attila
service
waltharius
and
hagano
won
great
renown
as
warriors
but
the
latter
eventually
made
his
escape
when
waltharius
grew
up
he
became
attila
chief
general
yet
he
remembered
his
old
engagement
with
hiltgund
on
his
return
from
a
victorious
campaign
he
made
a
great
feast
for
the
king
and
his
court
and
when
all
were
sunk
in
their
drunken
sleep
he
and
hiltgund
fled
laden
with
much
gold
on
their
way
home
they
had
to
cross
the
rhine
near
worms
there
the
king
of
the
franks
guntharius
the
son
of
gibicho
heard
from
the
ferryman
of
the
gold
they
were
carrying
and
determined
to
secure
it
accompanied
by
hagano
and
eleven
other
picked
warriors
he
overtook
them
as
they
rested
in
a
cave
in
the
vosges
waltharius
offered
him
a
large
share
of
the
gold
in
order
to
obtain
peace
but
the
king
demanded
the
whole
together
with
hiltgund
and
the
horses
stimulated
by
the
promise
of
great
rewards
the
eleven
warriors
now
attacked
waltharius
one
after
another
but
he
slew
them
all
hagano
had
tried
to
dissuade
guntharius
from
the
attack
but
now
since
his
nephew
was
among
the
slain
he
formed
a
plan
with
the
king
for
surprising
waltharius
on
the
following
day
they
both
fell
upon
him
after
he
had
quitted
his
stronghold
and
in
the
struggle
that
ensued
all
three
were
maimed
waltharius
however
was
able
to
proceed
on
his
way
with
hiltgund
and
the
story
ends
happily
with
their
marriage

the
meaning
of
this
passage
is
obscure
but
the
translation
here
given
seems
to
be
the
most
reasonable
conjecture
he
probably
refers
to
a
sword
that

in

ready
for

thus
to

to
mind

similar
passages

the
particular
story
in
mind
here
is
the
escape
of
theodoric
from

he
loses
his
way
and
falls
into
the
hands
of
one
of

this
fragment
belongs
to
the
epic
story
of
finn
which
is
alluded
to
at
some
length
in
vv
the
saga
can
be
reconstructed
in
its
broad
outlines
though
it
is
impossible
to
be
sure
of
details
one
of
the
most
puzzling
of
these
details
is
the
position
in
which
the
fight
occurs
in
the
story
are
two
fights
either
one
of
which
may
be
the
one
described
in
the
fragment
the
weight
of
opinion
seems
to
favor
the
first
conflict
that
in
which
hnæf
is
killed
as
summarized
by
möller
the
finn
story
is
briefly
as
follows
finn
king
of
the
frisians
had
carried
off
hildeburh
daughter
of
hoc
probably
with
her
consent
her
father
hoc
seems
to
have
pursued
the
fugitives
and
to
have
been
slain
in
the
fight
which
ensued
on
his
overtaking
them
after
the
lapse
of
some
twenty
years
hoc
sons
hnæf
and
hengest
were
old
enough
to
undertake
the
duty
of
avenging
their
father
death
they
make
an
inroad
into
finn
country
and
a
battle
takes
place
in
which
many
warriors
among
them
hnæf
and
a
son
of
finn
are
killed
peace
is
therefore
solemnly
concluded
and
the
slain
warriors
are
burnt
as
the
year
is
too
far
advanced
for
hengest
to
return
home
ff
he
and
those
of
his
men
who
survive
remain
for
the
winter
in
the
frisian
country
with
finn
but
hengest
thoughts
dwell
constantly
on
the
death
of
his
brother
hnæf
and
he
would
gladly
welcome
any
excuse
to
break
the
peace
which
had
been
sworn
by
both
parties
his
ill
concealed
desire
for
revenge
is
noticed
by
the
frisians
who
anticipate
it
by
themselves
taking
the
initiative
and
attacking
hengest
and
his
men
whilst
they
are
sleeping
in
the
hall
this
is
the
night
attack
described
in
the
fight
it
would
seem
that
after
a
brave
and
desperate
resistance
hengest
himself
falls
in
this
fight
at
the
hands
of
hunlafing
but
two
of
his
retainers
guthlaf
and
oslaf
succeed
in
cutting
their
way
through
their
enemies
and
in
escaping
to
their
own
land
they
return
with
fresh
troops
attack
and
slay
finn
and
carry
his
queen
hildeburh
off
with
them
wyatt
professor
gummere
finds
in
the
fragment
an
example
bearing
out
his
theory
of
the
development
of
the
epic
the
qualities
which
difference
it
from
he
says
are
mainly
negative
it
lacks
sentiment
moralizing
the
leisure
of
the
writer
it
did
not
attempt
probably
to
cover
more
than
a
single
event
and
one
will
not
err
in
finding
it
a
fair
type
of
the
epic
songs
which
roving
singers
were
wont
to
sing
before
lord
and
liegeman
in
hall
and
which
were
used
with
more
or
less
fidelity
by
makers
of

bridles
me

dangerous
power
to

where
crushing
my

sits
the
weight

still

over

in

fury
from
my
prison
below
obeying
his

who
bound
me
fast
in

at

when
he
fashioned
the
world
in
bonds

in
chains
with
no
chance
of

points
out
the

loud
soundeth

the
shouting
of
shipmen
unshaken
abide
the
stone
cliffs
steep
through
the
strife
of
the
waters
the
dashing
of
waves
when
the
deadly
tumult
crowds
to

cruel
strife
the
sailors
are
certain
if
the
sea
drive
their
craft
with

terrified
guests

grim
rolling
tide
they
are

that
the
ship
will
be
shorn
of
its
power
be
deprived
of
its
rule
and
will
ride
on
the
ridge
of
the

a
panic
fear
among
folk
of
the
force
that
commands
me
strong
on

shall
still
that
power
at

i

through

that
ride
on

wrench
them
asunder
and
lash
them
with

i
let
them
again
glide
back
together
it
is
the
greatest
of
noises
of
clamoring
crowds
of
crashes
the
loudest
when
clouds
as
they
strive
in
their
courses
shall
strike
edge
against
edge
inky
of
hue
in
flight
the
folk
bright
fire
they
sweat
a
stream
of
flame
destruction
they
carry
dark
over
men
with
a
mighty
din
fighting
they
fare
they
let
fall
from
their
bosom
a
deafening
rain
of
rattling
liquid
of
storm
from
their
bellies
in
battle
they
strive
the
awful
army
anguish
arises
terror

to
the
tribes
of
men
distress
in
the
strongholds
when
the
stalking
goblins
the
pale
ghosts
shoot
with
their
sharp
weapons
the
fool
alone
fears
not
their
fatal
spears
but
he
perishes
too
if
the
true
god
send
straight
from
above
in
streams
of
rain
whizzing
and
whistling
the
whirlwind
arrows
the
flying
death
few
shall
survive
whom
that
violent
guest
in
his
grimness
shall
visit
i
always
stir
up
that
strife

commotion
then
i
bear
my
course
to
the
battle
of
clouds
powerfully
strive
and
press
through

my

have
been
compared
to
a
passage
in
book
ii
often
the
lonely
one
longs
for
honors
the
grace
of
god
though
grieved
in
his
soul
over
the
waste
of
the
waters
far
and
wide
he
shall
row
with
his
hands
through
the
sea
travel
the
exile
tracks
full
determined
is
fate
so
the
wanderer
spake
his
woes
remembering
his
misfortunes
in
fighting
and
the
fall
of
his
kinsmen
often
alone
at
early
dawn
i
make
my
moan
not
a
man
now
lives
to
whom
i
can
speak
forth
my
heart
and
soul
and
tell
of
its
trials
in
truth
i
know
well
that
there
belongs
to
a
lord
an
illustrious
trait
to
fetter
his
feelings
fast
in
his
breast
to
keep
his
own
counsel
though
cares
oppress
him
the
weary
in
heart
against
wyrd
has
no
help
nor
may
the
troubled
in
thought
attempt
to
get
aid
therefore
the
thane
who
is
thinking
of
glory
binds
in
his
breast
his
bitterest
thoughts
so
i
fasten
with
fetters
confine
in
my
breast
my
sorrows
of
soul
though
sick
oft
at
heart
in
a
foreign
country
far
from
my
kinsmen
i
long
ago
laid
my
loyal
patron
in
sorrow
under
the
sod
since
then
i
have
gone
weary
with
over
the
wave
foamy
track
in
sadness
have
sought
a
solace
to
find
in
the
home
and
the
hall
of
a
host
and
who
mindful
of
mercy
in
the
free
in
kindness
would
comfort
and
care
for
me
friendless
would
treat
me
with
tenderness
the
tried
man
knows
how
stern
is
sorrow
how
distressing
a
comrade
for
him
who
has
few
of
friends
and
loved
ones
he
trails
the
track
of
the
exile
no
treasure
he
has
but
frost
no
fame
upon
earth
he
recalls
his
comrades
and
the
costly
of
his
gracious
which
he
gave
him
in
youth
to
expend
as
he
pleased
his
pleasure
has
vanished
he
who
lacks
for
long
his
lord
advice
his
love
and
his
wisdom
learns
full
well
how
sorrow
and
slumber
soothe
together
the
wanderer
to
welcome
peace
he
seems
in
his
sleep
to
see
his
lord
he
kisses
and
clasps
him
and
inclines
on
his
knee
his
hands
and
his
head
as
in
happier
days
when
he
experienced
the
pleasure
of
his
prince
favors
from
his
sleep
then
awakens
the
sorrowful
wanderer
he
sees
full
before
him
the
fallow
waves
the
bathing
and
beating
their
wings
frost
and
snow
falling
with
freezing
hail
then
heavier
grows
the
grief
of
his
heart
sad
after
his
dream
he
sorrows
anew
his
kinsmen
memory
he
calls
to
his
mind
and
eagerly
greets
it
in
gladness
he
sees
his
valiant
comrades
then
they
vanish
away
in
the
soul
of
a
sailor
no
songs
burst
forth
no
familiar
refrains
fresh
is
his
care
who
sends
his
soul
the
sea
full
oft
over
the
welling
waves
his
wearied
heart
hence
i
may
not
marvel
when
i
am
mindful
of
life
that
my
sorrowing
soul
grows
sick
and
dark
when
i
look
at
the
lives
of
lords
and
earls
how
they
are
suddenly
snatched
from
the
seats
of
their
power
in
their
princely
pride
so
passes
this
world
and
droops
and
dies
each
day
and
hour
and
no
man
is
sage
who
knows
not
his
share
of
winter
in
the
world
the
wise
man
is
patient
not
too
hot
in
his
heart
nor
too
hasty
in
words
nor
too
weak
in
war
nor
unwise
in
his
rashness
nor
too
forward
nor
fain
nor
fearful
of
death
nor
too
eager
and
arrogant
till
he
equal
his
boasting
the
wise
man
will
wait
with
his
words
of
boasting
till
restraining
his
thoughts
he
thoroughly
knows
where
his
vain
words
of
vaunting
eventually
will
lead
him
the
sage
man
perceives
how
sorrowful
it
is
when
all
the
wealth
of
the
world
lies
wasted
and
scattered
so
now
over
the
earth
in

land
stormed
on
by
winds
the
walls
are
standing
rimy
with
and
the
roofs
of

the
are
wasted
far
away
are
the
rulers
deprived
of
their
pleasure
all
the
proud
ones
have
fallen
the
warriors
by
the
wall
some
war
has
borne
off
in
its
bloody
embrace
some
birds
have
carried
over
the
high
seas
to
some
the
hoar
wolf
has
dealt
their
death
some
with
dreary
faces
by
earls
have
been
exiled
in
to
dwell
so
has
wasted
this
world
through
the
wisdom
of
god
till
the
proud
one
pleasure
has
perished
utterly
and
the
old
work
of
the
giants
stands
worthless
and
joyless
he
who
the
waste
of
this
wisely
considers
and
looks
down
deep
at
the
darkness
of
life
mournful
in
mind
remembers
of
old
much
struggle
and
spoil
and
speaks
these

where
are

proud
where
are

and
its
joys
alas
the
bright
alas
the
alas
the
prince
pride
how
passes
the
time
under
the
shadow
of
night
as
it
never
had
been
over
the
trusty
troop
now
towers
full
high
a
wall
adorned
with
wondrous
dragons
the
strength
of
the
spear
has
destroyed
the
earls

wyrd
inexorable
and
the
storms
strike
down
on
the
stony
cliffs
the
snows
descend
and
seize
all
the
earth
in
the
dread
of
winter
then
darkness
comes
and
dusky
down
from
the
north
the
hated
beat
on
heroes
with
fury
all
on

is
irksome
to
man
oft
changes

of

fates
the

under

all
idle
and

the

one
in

as
he
sits
and
secretly
ponders

is
the
man
who
is
true
to
his
trust
never
should
he
betray
anger
divulge
the
rage
of
his
heart
till
the
remedy
he
knows
that
quickly
will
quiet
his
spirit
the
quest
of
honor
is
a
noble
pursuit
glory

god
on

who
grants
us
our
salvation
these
opening
lines
are
typical
of
the
group
of
poems
usually
known
as
the
elegies
this
and
the
next
four
poems
in
the
book
it
is
probable
that
the
poems
of
this
group
have
no
relation
with
one
another
save
in
general
tone
a
deep
melancholy
that
though
present
in
the
other
old
english
poems
is
blackest
in
these
the
fate
of
the
germanic
peoples
the
life
was
overshadowed
by
the
power
of
wyrd
though
beowulf
says
that
a
man
may
escape
his
wyrd
if
he
be
good
enough
ancient
fortifications
and
cities
are
often
referred
to
in
poetry
as
the
old
work
of
the
giants
the
seafarer
edition
used
kluge
up
to
line
this
is
one
of
the
finest
specimens
of
poetry
it
expresses
as
few
poems
in
english
have
done
the
spirit
of
adventure
the
of
springtime
the
author
was
a
remarkable
painter
of
the
sea
and
its
conditions
from
line
to
the
end
the
poem
consists
of
a
very
tedious
homily
that
must
surely
be
a
later
addition
the
use
of
the
first
person
throughout
and
the
opposing
sentiments
expressed
have
caused
several
scholars
to
consider
the
first
part
of
the
poem
a
dialogue
between
a
young
man
eager
to
go
to
sea
and
an
old
sailor
the
divisions
of
the
speeches
suggested
have
been
as
follows
by
hönncher
by
kluge
by
rieger
sailor

or

sweet
in
his
objects
to
these
theories
since
there
are
not
only
no
headings
or
divisions
in
the
manuscript
to
indicate
such
divisions
but
there
are
no
breaks
or
contrasts
in
the
poem
itself
if
we
discard
these
theories
he
says
the
simplest
view
of
the
poem
is
that
it
is
the
monologue
of
an
old
sailor
who
first
describes
the
hardships
of
the
seafaring
life
and
then
confesses
its
irresistible
attraction
which
he
justifies
as
it
were
by
drawing
a
parallel
between
the
seafarer
contempt
for
the
luxuries
of
the
life
on
land
on
the
one
hand
and
the
aspirations
of
a
spiritual
nature
on
the
other
of
which
the
sea
bird
is
to
him
the
type
in
dwelling
on
these
ideals
the
poet
loses
sight
of
the
seafarer
and
his
associations
and
as
inevitably
rises
to
a
contemplation
of
the
cheering
hopes
of
a
future
life
afforded
by
christianity
the
dullness
and
obscurity
of
the
last
part
of
the
poem
however
and
the
obvious
similarity
to
the
homilies
of
the
time
make
it
very
unlikely
that
the
whole
poem
was
written
by
one
author

away
fastened
alone
in

he
smote
it

dost
thou
plan
to
turn
from
thy
plighted
troth
and
leave
my
love
alas
full
soon
i
am
oppressed
with
grief
and
deprived
of
honor
i
have
borne
for
thee
many
bitter
words
insulting
slurs
and
sorrowful
taunts
scathing
abuses
and
they
scorn
me
now
in
wrathful
tones
my
tears
i
shall
pour
in
sadness
of
soul
my
sorrowful
heart
my
grief
full
easily
our
god
may
heal
and
not
leave
me
forlorn
alas
young
damsel
mary
maiden
why
bemoanest
thou
and
bitterly
weepest
no
blame
in
thee
nor
any
fault
have
i
ever
found
for
wicked
works
and
this
word
thou
speakest
as
if
thou
thyself
with
sinful
deeds
and
faults
wert
filled
far
too
much
grief
thy
conception
has
caused
me
to
suffer
in
shame
how
can
i
bear
their
bitter
taunts
or
ever
make
answer
to
my
angry
foes
who
wish
me
woe
is
widely
known
that
i
took
from
the
glorious
temple
of
god
a
beautiful
virgin
of
virtue
unblemished
the
chastest
of
maidens
but
a
change
has
now
come
though
i
know
not
the
cause
nothing
avails
me
to
speak
or
to
be
silent
if
i
say
the
truth
then
the
daughter
of
david
shall
die
for
her
crime
struck
down
with
stones
yet
still
it
were
harder
to
conceal
the
sin
forsworn
forever
i
should
live
my
life
loathed
by
all
people
by
men
reviled
then
the
maid
revealed
the
work
of
wonder
and
these
words
she
spoke
truly
i
say
by
the
son
of
the
creator
the
savior
of
souls
the
son
of
god
i
tell
thee
in
truth
that
the
time
has
not
been
that
the
embrace
of
a
mortal
man
i
have
known
on
all
the
earth
but
early
in
life
this
grace
was
granted
me
that
gabriel
came
the
high
angel
of
heaven
and
hailed
me
in
greeting
in
truthful
speech
that
the
spirit
of
heaven
with
his
light
should
illumine
me
that
life
glory
by
me
should
be
borne
the
bright
son
the
blessed
child
of
god
of
the
kingly
creator
i
am
become
now
his
temple
unspoiled
and
spotless
the
spirit
of
comfort
hath
his
dwelling
in
me
endure
now
no
longer
sorrow
and
sadness
and
say
eternal
thanks
to
the
mighty
son
of
the
maker
that
his
mother
i
have
become
though
a
maid
i
remain
and
in
men
opinion
thou
art
famed
as
his
father
if
fulfillment
should
come
of
the
truth
that
the
prophets
foretold
of
his
coming
this
passage
is
especially
interesting
in
being
one
of
the
first
appearances
of
the
dialogue
form
in
old
english
some
scholars
have
gone
so
far
as
to
think
that
we
have
here
the
germ
from
which
english
drama
comes
but
there
does
not
seem
reason
to
believe
that
the
scene
ever
received
any
kind
of
dramatic
representation
rune
passage
not
ever
on
earth
need
any
man
have
dread
of
the
darts
of
the
devil
race
of
the
fighting
of
the
fiends
whose
defense
is
in
god
the
just
lord
of
hosts
the
judgment
is
nigh
when
each
without
fail
shall
find
his
reward
of
weal
or
of
woe
for
his
work
on
the
earth
during
the
time
of
his
life
is
told
us
in
books
how
from
on
high
the
humble
one
came
the
of
honor
to
the
earth
below
in
the
virgin
womb
the
valiant
son
of
god
holy
from
on
high
i
hope
in
truth
and
also
dread
the
doom
far
sterner
when
christ
and
his
angels
shall
come
again
since
i
kept
not
closely
the
counsels
my
savior
bade
in
his
books
i
shall
bear
therefore
to
see
the
work
of
sin
it
shall
certainly
be
when
many
shall
be
led
to
meet
their
doom
to
receive
justice
in
the
sight
of
their
judge
then
the
shall
tremble
shall
attend
the
king
the
righteous
ruler
when
his
wrath
he
speaks
to
the
worldlings
who
weakly
his
warning
have
heeded
while
their
and
even
yet
could
have
easily
found
a
comfort
there
cowering
in
fear
many
wearily
shall
wait
on
the
wide
plain
what
doom
shall
be
dealt
them
for
the
deeds
of
their
life
of
angry
penalties
departed
hath
the
ornaments
of
earth
it
to
be
true
that
long
our
were
locked
in
the
our
on
earth
in
the
fire
shall
our
treasure
burn
in
the
blast
brightly
shall
mount
the
red
flame
raging
and
wrathfully
striding
over
the
wide
world
wasted
shall
be
the
plains
the
castles
shall
crumble
then
shall
climb
the
swift
fire
the
greediest
of
guests
grimly
and
ruthlessly
eat
the
ancient
treasure
that
of
old
men
possessed
while
still
on
the
earth
was
their
strength
and
their
pride
hence
i
strive
to
instruct
each
steadfast
man
that
he
be
cautious
in
the
care
of
his
soul
and
not
pour
it
forth
in
pride
in
that
portion
of
days
that
the
lord
allows
him
to
live
in
the
world
while
the
soul
abideth
safe
in
the
body
in
that
friendly
home
it
behooveth
each
man
to
bethink
him
deeply
in
the
days
of
his
life
how
meekly
and
mildly
the
mighty
lord
came
of
old
to
us
by
an
angel
word
yet
grim
shall
he
be
when
again
he
cometh
harsh
and
righteous
then
the
heavens
shall
rock
and
the
measureless
ends
of
the
mighty
earth
shall
tremble
in
terror
the
triumphant
king
shall
avenge
their
vain
and
vicious
lives
their
loathsome
wickedness
long
shall
they
wallow
with
heavy
hearts
in
the
heat
of
the
fire
bath
suffer
for
their
sins
in
its
surging
flame

the

is
usually
regarded
as
cynewulf
masterpiece
the
vision
of
the
cross
oppressed
the
roman
ruler
of
his
realm
he
despaired
he
was
lacking
in
fighters
too
few
were
his
warriors
his
close
comrades
to
conquer
in
battle
their
eager
enemy
the
army
encamped
earls
about
their
ætheling
at
the
edge
of
the
stream
where
they
spread
their
tents
for
the
space
of
the
night
after
first
they
had
found
their
foes
approach
to
cæsar
himself
in
his
sleep
there
came
a
dream
as
he
lay
with
his
doughty
men
to
the
valiant
king
a
vision
appeared
it
seemed
that
he
saw
a
soldier
bright
glorious
and
gleaming
in
the
guise
of
a
man
more
fair
of
form
than
before
or
after
he
had
seen
under
the
skies
from
his
sleep
he
awoke
hastily
donned
his
helmet
the
herald
straightway
the
resplendent
messenger
spoke
unto
him
named
him
by
name
the
night
vanished
away
o
constantine
the
king
of
angels
bids
the
master
almighty
to
make
thee
a
compact
the
lord
of
the
faithful
no
fear
shouldst
thou
have
though
foreign
foes
bring
frightful
war
and
horrors
unheard
of
to
heaven
now
look
to
the
guardian
of
glory
thou
shalt
gain
there
support
the
sign
of
victory
soon
was
he
ready
to
obey
the
holy
bidding
and
unbound
his
heart
and
gazed
on
high
as
the
herald
had
bade
him
the
princely
with
precious
jewels
adorned
he
saw
the
radiant
rood
over
the
roof
of
clouds
gorgeous
with
gold
and
gleaming
gems
the
brilliant
beam
bore
these
letters
shining
with
light
thou
shalt
with
this
sign
overcome
and
conquer
in
thy
crying
need
the
fearsome
foe
then
faded
the
light
and
joining
the
herald
journeyed
on
high
unto
the
company
the
king
was
the
blither
and
suffered
in
his
soul
less
sorrow
and
anguish
the
valiant
victor
through
the
vision
this
is
a
translation
of
the
famous
latin
motto
hoc
signo
the
discovery
of
the
cross
striving
in
strength
and
with
steadfast
heart
he
began
to
delve
for
the
glorious
tree
under
its
covering
of
turf
till
at
twenty
feet
below
the
surface
concealed
he
found
shut
out
from
sight
under
the
shelving
cliff
in
the
chasm
of
darkness
three
crosses
he
found
in
their
gloomy
grave
together
he
found
them
grimy
all
over
as
in
ancient
days
the
unrighteous
race
had
wrapped
them
in
earth
the
sinful
jews
against
the
son
of
god
they
showed
their
hate
as
they
should
not
have
done
had
they
not
harkened
to
the
behests
of
the
devil
then
blithe
was
his
heart
and
blissful
within
him
his
soul
was
inspired
by
the
sacred
tree
his
heart
was
emboldened
when
he
beheld
that
beacon
holy
and
deep
hidden
with
his
hands
he
seized
the
radiant
cross
of
heaven
and
with
his
host
he
raised
it
from
its
grave
in
the
earth
the
guests
from
afar
and
princes
and
æthelings
went
all
to
the
town
in
her
sight
they
set
the
three
sacred
trees
the
proud
valiant
men
plain
to
be
seen
before
elene
knee
and
now
was
joy
in
the
heart
of
the
queen
she
inquired
of
the
men
on
which
of
the
crosses
the
crucified
lord
the
heavenly
hung
in
pain
lo
we
have
heard
from
the
holy
books
it
told
for
a
truth
that
two
of
them
suffered
with
him
and
himself
was
the
third
on
the
hallowed
tree
the
heavens
were
darkened
in
that
terrible
time
tell
if
you
can
on
which
of
these
roods
the
ruler
of
angels
the
savior
of
men
suffered
his
death
in
no
wise
could
judas
for
he
knew
not
at
all
clearly
reveal
that
victory
tree
on
which
the
lord
was
lifted
high
the
son
of
god
but
they
set
by
his
order
in
the
very
middle
of
the
mighty
city
the
towering
trees
to
tarry
there
till
the
almighty
king
should
manifest
clearly
before
the
multitude
the
might
of
that
marvelous
rood
the
assembly
sat
their
song
uplifted
they
mused
in
their
minds
on
the
mystery
trees
until
the
ninth
hour
when
new
delight
grew
through
a
marvelous
deed
there
a
multitude
came
of
folk
not
a
little
and
lifted
among
them
there
was
borne
on
a
bier
by
men
nigh
to
the
spot
it
was
the
ninth
hour
a
lifeless
youth
then
was
lifted
the
heart
of
judas
in
great
rejoicing
and
gladness
he
commanded
them
to
set
the
soulless
man
with
life
cut
off
the
corpse
on
the
earth
bereft
of
life
and
there
was
raised
aloft
by
the
proclaimer
of
justice
the
crafty
of
heart
the
trusty
in
counsel
two
of
the
crosses
over
that
house
of
death
it
was
dead
as
before
the
body
fast
to
the
bier
about
the
chill
limbs
was
grievous
doom
then
began
the
third
cross
to
be
lifted
aloft
there
lay
the
body
until
above
him
was
reared
the
rood
of
the
lord
the
holy
cross
of
heaven

the

of

he
soon
arose
with
spirit
regained
and
again
were
joined

was
the
praise
and
fair
of

lo
i
shall
tell
you
the
truest
of
visions
a
dream
that
i
dreamt
in
the
dead
of
night
while
people
reposed
in
peaceful
sleep
i
seemed
to
see
the
sacred
tree
lifted
on
high
in
a
halo
of
light
the
brightest
of
beams
that
beacon
was
wholly
gorgeous
with
gold
glorious
gems
stood
fair
at
the
foot
and
five
were
assembled
at
the
crossing
of
the
arms
the
angels
of
god
looked
on
fair
through
the
firmament
it
was
truly
no
foul
cross
for
beholding
his
sufferings
were
the
holy
spirits
the
men
of
the
earth
and
all
of
creation
wondrous
was
that
and
i
wounded
and
stained
with
sorrows
and
sins
i
saw
the
tree
of
glory
blessed
and
bright
in
brilliant
adornments
made
joyous
with
jewels
gems
on
all
sides
full
rarely
enriched
the
rood
of
the
savior
through
the
sight
of
that
cross
i
came
to
perceive
its
stiff
struggle
of
old
when
it
started
first
to
bleed
on
the
right
side
i
was
broken
and
cast
down
with
sorrow
the
fair
sight
inspired
me
with
fear
before
me
the
moving
beacon
changed
its
clothing
and
color
at
times
it
was
covered
with
blood
fearful
and
grimy
with
gore
at
times
with
gold
was
adorned
then
i
lay
and
looked
for
a
long
time
and
saw
the
savior
sorrowful
tree
until
i
heard
it
lift
high
its
voice
the
worthiest
of
the
formed
words
and
spoke
it
was
ages
ago
i
shall
always
remember
when
first
i
was
felled
at
the
forest
edge
my
strong
trunk
stricken
then
strange
enemies
took
me
and
fashioned
my
frame
to
a
cross
and
their
felons
i
raised
on
high
on
their
backs
and
shoulders
they
bore
me
to
the
brow
of
the
lofty
hill
there
the
hated
ones
solidly
set
me
i
saw
there
the
lord
of
mankind
struggling
forward
with
courage
to
climb
my
sturdy
trunk
i
dared
not
then
oppose
the
purpose
of
the
lord
so
i
bent
not
nor
broke
when
there
burst
forth
a
trembling
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
easily
might
i
destroy
the
murderers
but
i
stood
unmoved
the
young
hero
unclothed
him
it
was
the
holy
god
strong
and
steadfast
he
stepped
to
the
high
gallows
not
fearing
the
look
of
the
fiends
and
there
he
freed
mankind
at
his
blessed
embrace
i
trembled
but
bow
to
the
earth
i
dared
not
or
forward
to
fall
to
the
ground
but
fast
and
true
i
endured
as
a
rood
i
was
raised
up
a
royal
king
i
bore
the
lord
of
heavenly
legions
i
allowed
myself
never
to
bend
dark
nails
through
me
they
drove
so
that
dastardly
scars
are
upon
me
wounds
wide
open
but
not
one
of
them
dared
i
to
harm
they
cursed
and
reviled
us
together
i
was
covered
all
over
with
blood
that
flowed
from
the
savior
side
when
his
soul
had
left
the
flesh
sorrowful
the
sights
i
have
seen
on
that
hill
grief
the
god
of
mankind
i
saw
and
his
frightful
death
the
forces
of
darkness
covered
with
clouds
the
corpse
of
the
lord
the
shining
radiance
the
shadows
darkened
under
the
cover
of
clouds
creation
all
wept
the
king
fall
bewailed
christ
was
on
the
rood
finally
from
afar
came
faithful
comrades
to
the
savior
side
and
i
saw
it
all
bitter
the
grief
that
i
bore
but
i
bowed
me
low
to
their
hands
my
travail
was
grievous
and
sore
they
took
then
god
almighty
from
loathsome
torment
they
lifted
him
the
warriors
left
me
deserted
to
stand
stained
with
blood
i
was
stricken
and
wounded
with
nails
they
laid
him
there
and
at
their
lord
head
they
stood
they
beheld
there
the
ruler
of
heaven
and
they
halted
a
while
to
rest
tired
after
the
terrible
struggle
a
tomb
then
they
began
to
make
his
friends
in
sight
of
his
foes
of
the
fairest
of
stone
they
built
it
and
set
their
savior
upon
it
a
sorrowful
dirge
they
chanted
lamented
their
master
at
evening
when
they
made
their
journey
home
tired
from
their
loved
lord
side
and
they
left
him
with
the
guard
we
crosses
stood
there
streaming
with
blood
and
waited
long
after
the
wailing
ceased
of
the
brave
company
the
body
grew
cold
the
most
precious
of
corpses
then
they
pulled
us
down
all
to
the
earth
an
awful
fate
they
buried
us
low
in
a
pit
but
the
loved
disciples
of
christ
his
faithful
friends
made
search
and
found
me
and
brought
me
to
light
and
gorgeously
decked
me
with
gold
and
with
silver
now
mayst
thou
learn
my
beloved
friend
that
the
work
of
the
wicked
i
have
worthily
borne
the
most
trying
of
torments
the
time
is
now
come
when
through
the
wide
world
i
am
worshipped
and
honored
that
all
manner
of
men
and
the
mighty
creation
hold
sacred
this
sign
on
me
the
son
of
god
endured
hence
dauntless
in
glory
i
rise
high
under
heaven
and
hold
out
salvation
to
each
and
to
all
who
have
awe
in
my
presence
long
ago
i
was
the
greatest
and
most
grievous
of
torments
most
painful
of
punishments
till
i
pointed
aright
the
road
of
life
for
the
race
of
men
lo
a
glory
was
given
by
the
god
of
creation
to
the
worthless
wood
by
the
warden
of
heaven
just
as
mary
his
mother
the
maiden
blessed
received
grace
and
glory
from
god
almighty
and
homage
and
worship
over
other
women
and
now
i
bid
thee
my
best
of
comrades
that
thou
reveal
this
vision
to
men
tell
them
i
am
truly
the
tree
of
glory
that
the
savior
sorrowed
and
suffered
upon
me
for
the
race
of
men
and
its
many
sins
and
the
ancient
evil
that
adam
wrought
he
there
tasted
of
death
but
in
triumph
he
rose
the
lord
in
his
might
and
gave
life
unto
men
then
he
ascended
to
heaven
and
hither
again
shall
the
savior
descend
to
seek
mankind
on
the
day
of
doom
the
dreaded
ruler
of
highest
heaven
with
his
host
of
angels
then
will
he
adjudge
with
justice
and
firmness
rewards
to
the
worthy
whose
works
have
deserved
them
who
loyally
lived
their
lives
on
the
earth
then
a
feeling
of
fear
shall
fill
every
heart
for
the
warning
they
had
in
the
words
of
their
master
he
shall
demand
of
many
where
the
man
may
be
found
to
consent
for
the
sake
of
his
savior
to
taste
the
bitter
death
as
he
did
on
the
cross
they
are
filled
with
fear
and
few
of
them
think
what
words
they
shall
speak
in
response
to
christ
then
no
feeling
of
fright
or
fear
need
he
have
who
bears
on
his
heart
the
brightest
of
tokens
but
there
shall
come
to
the
kingdom
through
the
cross
and
its
power
all
the
souls
of
the
saved
from
the
sorrows
of
earth
of
the
holy
who
hope
for
a
home
with
their
lord
then
i
adored
the
cross
with
undaunted
courage
with
the
warmest
zeal
while
i
watched
alone
and
saw
it
in
secret
my
soul
was
eager
to
depart
on
its
path
but
i
have
passed
through
many
an
hour
of
longing
through
all
my
life
i
shall
seek
the
sight
of
that
sacred
tree
alone
more
often
than
all
other
men
and
worthily
worship
it
my
will
for
this
service
is
steadfast
and
sturdy
and
my
strength
is
ever
in
the
cross
of
christ
my
comrades
of
old
the
friends
of
fortune
all
far
from
the
earth
have
departed
from
the
world
and
its
pleasures
and
have
passed
to
the
king
of
glory
and
high
in
the
heavens
with
the
holy
god
are
living
eternally
and
i
long
for
the
time
to
arrive
at
last
when
the
rood
of
the
lord
which
once
so
plainly
appeared
to
my
sight
shall
summon
my
soul
from
this
sorrowful
life
and
bring
me
to
that
bourne
where
bliss
is
unending
and
happiness
of
heaven
where
the
holy
saints
all
join
in
a
banquet
where
joy
is
eternal
may
he
set
me
where
always
in
after
time
i
shall
dwell
in
glory
with
god
chosen
ones
in
delights
everlasting
may
the
lord
be
my
friend
who
came
to
earth
and
of
old
on
the
cross
suffered
and
sorrowed
for
the
sins
of
men
he
broke
there
our
bonds
and
bought
for
us
life
and
a
heavenly
home
the
hearts
were
now
filled
with
blessings
and
bliss
which
once
burned
with
remorse
to
the
son
was
his
journey
successful
and
joyful
and
crowned
with
triumph
when
he
came
with
his
troops
with
his
gladsome
guests
into
god
kingdom
the
almighty
judge
and
brought
joy
to
the
angels
and
the
host
of
the
holy
who
in
heaven
before
dwelt
in
glory
when
their
god
arrived
the
lord
most
high
at
his
home
at
last
the
lines
that
follow
appear
with
some
changes
on
the
ruthwell
cross
in
dumfriesshire
this
and
the
following
line
form
the
basis
of
an
inscription
on
a

containing
a

preserved
in
the
cathedral
at

judith
critical

phoenix
and
other

the

as
the

was
injured
by

fire
in
it
had
been
printed
by
thwaites
in
before
the
injury
authorship
and
date
the
mixture
of
dialect
forms
seems
to
indicate
that
a
northern
original
passed
through
one
or
more
hands
and
that
at
least
the
last
scribe
belonged
to
the
late
west
saxon
period
cook
thinks
that
it
is
not
earlier
than
about
nor
later
than
and
that
it
is
possibly
by
cynewulf
source
apocryphal
book
of

the

she
doubted
not
the
gifts
in
this
wide
world
there
worthily
she
found
help
at
the
hands
of
the
lord
when
she
had
the
highest
need
grace
from
god
on
high
that
against
the
greatest
of
dangers
the
lord
of

should
protect
her

the
heavenly
father
graciously
granted
her
wish
for
she
had
given
true
faith
to
the
holy
ruler
of

holofernes
then
i
am
told
called
his
warriors
to
a
and
a
wondrous
and
glorious
banquet
prepared
to
this
the
prince
of
men
bade
the
bravest
of
thanes
then
with
bold
haste
to
the
powerful
prince
came
the
proud
before
the
chief
of
the
folk
that
was
the
fourth
day
since
the
gentle
judith
just
in
her
thoughts
of
beauty
was
brought
to
the
king
then
they
sought
the
assembly
to
sit
at
the
banquet
proud
to
the
all
his
partners
in
woe
bold
bowls
large
and
deep
were
borne
along
the
benches
beakers
also
and
flagons
full
to
the
feasters
fated
they
drank
it
renowned
though
he
knew
not
their
doom
the
hateful
lord
of
heroes
holofernes
the
king
bestower
of
jewels
took
joy
in
the
howled
and
hurled
forth
a
hideous
din
that
the
folk
of
the
earth
from
afar
might
hear
how
the
stalwart
and
stormed
and
bellowed
maddened
by
he
demanded
full
oft
that
the
brave
should
bear
themselves
well
so
the
hellish
demon
through
the
whole
of
the
day
drenched
with
drink
his
dear
companions
the
cruel
till
unconscious
they
lay
all
drunk
his
doughty
ones
as
if
in
death
they
were
slain
every
good
gone
from
them
although
the
fragment
begins
in
the
middle
of
a
line
it
presents
the
appearance
of
being
practically
complete
certainly
as
it
stands
it
makes
an
artistic
whole
we
begin
and
end
the
poem
by
showing
how
judith
was
favored
of
god
within
a
very
short
space
after
the
opening
lines
we
are
in
the
midst
of
the
action
judith
has
come
from
her
beleaguered
city
of
bethulia
and
enchanted
holofernes
by
her
beauty
and
holofernes
has
finished
his
great
feast
by
summoning
her
to
him
all
this
is
put
before
us
in
the
first
lines
the
rest
of
the
poem
is
vividly
conceived
from
the
slaying
of
the
assyrian
king
to
the
final
victory
and
rejoicing
the
slaying
of
holofernes
he
gave
then
commands
to
serve
the
till
descending
upon
them
dark
night
came
near
the
ignoble
one
ordered
the
blessed
maiden
burdened
with
jewels
freighted
with
rings
to
be
fetched
in
all
haste
to
his
hated
bedside
his
behest
they
performed
his
corps
of
retainers
the
commands
of
their
lord
chief
of
the
champions
cheerfully
they
stepped
to
the
royal
where
full
ready
they
found
the
queenly
judith
and
quickly
then
the
goodly
knights
began
to
lead
the
holy
maiden
to
the
high
tent
where
the
rich
ruler
rested
always
lay
him
at
night
loathsome
to
god
holofernes
there
hung
an
radiant
around
the
bed
embroidered
so
that
the
baleful
one
the
loathed
leader
might
look
unhindered
on
everyone
of
the
warrior
band
who
entered
in
and
on
him
none
of
the
sons
of
men
unless
some
of
his
nobles
contrivers
of
crime
he
called
to
his
presence
his
barons
to
bring
him
advice
then
they
bore
to
his
rest
the
wisest
of
women
went
then
the
band
to
make
known
to
their
master
that
the
maiden
of
god
was
brought
to
his
bower
then
blithe
was
the
chief
in
his
heart
the
builder
of
the
bright
maiden
he
planned
with
loathsome
filth
to
defile
but
the
father
of
heaven
knew
his
purpose
the
prince
of
goodness
and
with
power
he
restrained
him
god
the
wielder
of
glory
glad
then
the
hateful
one
went
with
his
riotous
rout
of
retainers
baleful
to
his
bedside
where
his
blood
should
be
spilled
suddenly
in
a
single
night
full
surely
his
end
approached
on
earth
ungentle
even
as
he
lived
stern
striver
for
evil
while
still
in
this
world
he
dwelt
under
the
roof
of
the
clouds
drunken
with
wine
then
he
fell
in
the
midst
of
his
regal
rest
so
that
he
recked
not
of
counsel
in
the
chamber
of
his
mind
the
champions
stepped
out
of
his
presence
and
parted
in
haste
the
warriors
who
went
with
the
false
one
and
the
evil
enemy
of
man
ushered
to
bed
for
the
last
time
then
the
lord
servant
the
mighty
was
mindful
in
all
things
how
she
most
easily
from
the
evil
contriver
his
life
might
snatch
ere
the
lecherous
deceiver
the
creature
awoke
the
maiden
of
god
then
seized
the
sword
well
ground
sharp
from
the
hammers
and
from
its
sheath
drew
it
with
her
right
hand
heaven
guardian
she
began
to
call
by
name
creator
of
all
the
dwellers
in
the
world
and
these
words
she
spoke
o
heavenly
god
and
holy
ghost
son
of
the
almighty
i
will
seek
from
thee
thy
mercy
unfailing
to
defend
me
from
evil
o
holiest
trinity
truly
for
me
now
full
sore
is
my
soul
and
sorrowful
my
heart
tormented
with
griefs
grant
me
lord
of
the
skies
success
and
soundness
of
faith
that
with
this
sword
i
may
behead
this
hideous
monster
heed
my
prayer
for
salvation
noble
lord
of
nations
never
have
i
had
more
need
of
thy
mercy
mighty
lord
avenge
now
bringer
of
glory
that
i
am
thus
baffled
in
spirit
heated
in
heart
her
then
the
greatest
of
judges
with
dauntless
daring
inspired
as
he
doth
ever
to
all
the
sons
of
the
spirit
who
seek
him
for
help
with
reason
and
with
right
belief
then
was
to
the
righteous
in
mind
holy
hope
renewed
the
heathen
man
then
she
took
and
held
by
his
hair
with
her
hands
she
drew
him
shamefully
toward
her
and
the
traitorous
deceiver
laid
as
she
listed
most
loathsome
of
men
in
order
that
easily
the
enemy
body
she
might
wield
at
her
will
the
wicked
one
she
slew
the
maiden
with
her
sword
smote
the
one
till
she
half
cut
through
severing
his
neck
so
that
swooning
he
lay
drunken
and
not
dead
was
he
yet
nor
lifeless
entirely
the
triumphant
lady
more
earnestly
smote
the
second
time
the
heathen
hound
so
that
his
head
was
thrown
forth
on
the
floor
foul
lay
the
carcass
bereft
of
a
soul
the
spirit
went
elsewhere
under
the
burning
abyss
where
abandoned
it
lay
tied
down
in
torment
till
time
shall
cease
with
serpents
bewound
amid
woes
and
tortures
all
firmly
fixed
in
the
flames
of
hell
when
death
came
upon
him
he
durst
not
hope
enveloped
in
blackness
to
venture
forth
ever
from
that
dreary
hole
but
dwell
there
he
shall
forever
and
aye
till
the
end
of
time
in
that
hideous
home
without
hope
of
joy
here
begins
a
series
of
extended
lines
which
some
critics
think
are
intended
to
lend
an
air
of
solemnity
to
the
passage
a
study
of
the
occurrence
of
these
long
lines
in
this
and
other
poems
such
as
or
does
not
seem
to
bear
out
this
contention
usually
these
long
lines
have
three
accents
in
each
half
the
rules
for
the
alliteration
are
the
same
as
for
the
short
verses
the
return
to
bethulia
great
was
the
glory
then
gained
in
the
fight
by
judith
at
war
through
the
will
of
god
the
mighty
master
who
permitted
her
victory
then
the
maiden
immediately
threw
the
heathen
warrior
head
so
bloody
concealed
it
in
the
sack
that
her
servant
had
brought
the
woman
polished
in
manners
which
before
she
had
filled
with
food
for
them
both
then
the
gory
head
gave
she
to
her
goodly
to
bear
to
their
home
to
her
helper
she
gave
it
to
her
junior
companion
then
they
journeyed
together
both
of
the
women
bold
in
their
daring
the
mighty
in
mind
the
maidens
exultant
till
they
had
wholly
escaped
from
the
host
of
the
enemy
and
could
full
clearly
catch
the
first
sight
of
their
sacred
city
and
see
the
walls
of
bright
bethulia
then
the
ones
traveling
on
foot
went
forth
in
haste
until
they
had
journeyed
with
joy
in
their
hearts
to
the
the
warriors
sat
unwearied
in
watching
the
wardens
on
duty
fast
in
the
fortress
as
the
folk
erstwhile
the
grieved
ones
of
mind
by
the
maiden
were
counselled
by
the
wary
judith
when
she
went
on
her
journey
the
woman
she
had
come
once
more
dear
to
her
people
the
prudent
in
counsel
she
straightway
summoned
certain
of
the
heroes
from
the
spacious
city
speedily
to
meet
her
and
allow
her
to
enter
without
loss
of
time
through
the
gate
of
the
wall
and
these
words
she
spoke
to
the
i
may
tell
to
you
now
noteworthy
news
that
you
need
no
longer
mourn
in
your
mind
for
the
master
is
kind
to
you
the
ruler
of
nations
it
is
known
afar
around
the
wide
world
that
you
have
won
glory
very
great
victory
is
vouchsafed
in
return
for
all
the
evils
and
ills
you
have
suffered
blithe
then
became
the
burghers
within
when
they
heard
how
the
holy
maid
spoke
over
the
high
wall
the
warriors
rejoiced
to
the
gate
of
the
fortress
the
folk
then
hastened
wives
with
their
husbands
in
hordes
and
in
bands
in
crowds
and
in
companies
they
crushed
and
thronged
towards
the
handmaid
of
god
by
hundreds
and
thousands
old
ones
and
young
ones
all
of
the
men
in
the
goodly
city
were
glad
in
their
hearts
at
the
joyous
news
that
judith
was
come
again
to
her
home
and
hastily
then
with
humble
hearts
the
heroes
received
her
then
gave
the
sagacious
in
mind
command
to
her
comrade
her
faithful
the
heathen
chief
head
to
hold
forth
to
the
people
to
the
assembly
to
show
as
a
sign
and
a
token
all
bloody
to
the
burghers
how
in
battle
they
sped
to
the
famed
the
fair
maiden
spoke
o
proudest
of
peoples
princely
protectors
gladly
now
gaze
on
the
gory
face
on
the
hated
head
of
the
heathen
warrior
holofernes
wholly
who
most
of
all
men
contrived
murder
against
us
the
sorest
of
sorrows
and
sought
even
yet
with
greater
to
grind
us
but
god
would
not
suffer
him
longer
to
live
that
with
loathsomest
evils
the
proud
one
should
oppress
us
i
deprived
him
of
life
through
the
grace
of
god
now
i
give
commands
to
you
citizens
bold
you
soldiers
protectors
of
the
people
to
prepare
one
and
all
forthwith
for
the
fight
when
first
from
the
east
the
king
of
creation
the
kindest
of
lords
sends
the
first
beams
of
light
bring
forth
your
boards
for
your
breasts
and
your
your
helmets
to
the
hosts
of
the
scathers
to
fell
the
the
fated
chieftains
with
your
fretted
swords
your
foes
are
all
doomed
to
the
death
and
glory
shall
be
yours
in
battle
as
the
blessed
creator
the
mighty
master
through
me
has
made
known
the
battle
then
a
band
of
bold
knights
busily
gathered
keen
men
at
the
conflict
with
courage
they
stepped
forth
bearing
banners
companions
and
fared
to
the
fight
forth
in
right
order
heroes
under
helmets
from
the
holy
city
at
the
dawning
of
day
dinned
forth
their
shields
a
alarm
now
listened
in
joy
the
lank
wolf
in
the
wood
and
the
wan
raven
bird
both
knowing
well
that
the
gallant
people
would
give
to
them
soon
a
feast
on
the
fated
now
flew
on
their
track
the
deadly
devourer
the
eagle
singing
his
the
bird
the
horned
of
beak
then
hurried
the
warriors
keen
for
the
conflict
covered
with
shields
with
hollow
lindens
they
who
long
had
endured
the
taunts
and
the
tricks
of
the
treacherous
strangers
the
host
of
the
heathen
hard
was
it
repaid
now
to
all
the
assyrians
every
insult
revenged
at
the
shock
of
the
shields
when
the
hebrews
bravely
to
battle
marched
under
banners
of
war
to
face
the
foeman
forthwith
then
they
sharply
shot
forth
showers
of
arrows
bitter
from
their
bows
of
horn
hurled
straight
from
the
string
stormed
and
raged
loudly
the
dauntless
avengers
darts
were
sent
whizzing
into
the
hosts
of
the
hardy
ones
heroes
were
angry
the
dwellers
in
the
land
at
the
dastardly
race
they
stepped
stern
in
their
mood
on
their
enemies
of
old
took
awful
revenge
on
their
foes
with
the
might
of
their
hands
their
shining
swords
from
their
sheaths
they
drew
forth
with
the
choicest
of
edges
the
champions
they
smote
furiously
felled
the
folk
of
assyria
the
spiteful
despoilers
they
spared
not
a
one
of
the
hated
host
neither
high
nor
low
of
living
men
that
they
might
overcome
so
the
at
the
coming
of
morning
followed
the
foemen
fiercely
attacking
them
till
pressed
and
in
panic
the
proud
ones
perceived
that
the
chief
and
the
champions
of
the
chosen
people
with
the
swing
of
the
sword
swept
all
before
them
the
wise
hebrew
warriors
then
word
they
carried
to
the
eldest
officers
over
the
camp
ran
with
the
wretched
news
arousing
the
leaders
fully
informed
them
of
the
fearful
disaster
told
the
merry
of
the
morning
encounter
of
the
horrible
i
heard
then
suddenly
the
men
from
sleep
awakened
and
toward
the
of
the
baleful
chief
holofernes
they
hastened
in
hosts
they
crowded
thickly
they
thronged
one
thought
had
they
only
their
lasting
loyalty
to
their
lord
to
show
before
in
their
fury
they
fell
upon
him
the
host
of
the
hebrews
the
whole
crowd
imagined
that
the
lord
of
despoilers
and
the
spotless
lady
together
remained
in
the
gorgeous
tent
the
virtuous
virgin
and
the
vicious
deceiver
dreadful
and
direful
they
dared
not
however
awaken
the
warrior
not
one
of
the
earls
nor
be
first
to
find
how
had
fared
through
the
night
the
most
churlish
of
chieftains
and
the
chastest
of
maidens
the
pride
of
the
lord
now
approached
in
their
strength
the
folk
of
the
hebrews
they
fought
remorselessly
with
weapons
with
their
hilts
requited
their
strife
of
long
standing
with
stained
swords
repaid
their
ancient
enmity
all
of
assyria
was
subdued
and
doomed
that
day
by
their
work
its
pride
bowed
low
in
panic
and
fright
in
terror
they
stood
around
the
tent
of
their
chief
moody
in
mind
then
the
men
all
together
in
concert
clamored
and
cried
aloud
ungracious
to
god
and
gritted
their
teeth
grinding
them
in
their
grief
then
was
their
glory
at
an
end
their
noble
deeds
and
daring
hopes
then
they
deemed
it
wise
to
summon
their
lord
from
his
sleep
but
success
was
denied
them
a
loyal
liegeman
long
had
he
wavered
desperately
dared
the
door
to
enter
ventured
into
the
pavilion
violent
need
drove
him
on
the
bed
then
he
found
in
frightful
state
lying
his
ghastly
gone
was
his
spirit
no
life
in
him
lingered
the
liegeman
straight
fell
trembling
with
terror
he
tore
at
his
hair
he
clawed
at
his
clothes
he
clamored
despairing
and
to
the
waiting
warriors
these
words
he
said
as
they
stood
outside
in
sadness
and
fear
here
is
made
manifest
our
imminent
doom
is
clearly
betokened
that
the
time
is
near
pressing
upon
us
with
perils
and
woes
when
we
lose
our
lives
and
lie
defeated
by
the
hostile
host
here
hewn
by
the
sword
our
lord
is
beheaded
with
heavy
spirits
they
threw
their
weapons
away
and
weary
in
heart
scattered
in
flight
the
picture
of
the
birds
of
prey
hovering
over
the
battle
field
is
one
of
the
constant
features
of
battle
poetry
note
its
occurrence
in
fight
at
and
battle
of
especially
the
pursuit
then
their
foemen
pursued
them
their
grim
power
growing
until
the
greatest
part
of
the
cowardly
band
they
conquered
in
battle
on
the
field
of
victory
vanquished
and
they
lay
at
the
will
of
the
wolves
for
the
watchful
and
greedy
fowls
to
feed
upon
then
fled
the
survivors
from
the
shields
of
their
foemen
sharp
on
their
trail
came
the
crowd
of
the
hebrews
covered
with
victory
with
honors

then
accorded
them
graciously
granted
them

almighty
they
then
daringly
with
dripping
swords
the
corps
of
brave
kinsmen
cut
them

of
the
hated
ones
they
hewed
with
their
swords
sheared
through

shot
fast
and
furiously

stirred
to

the
stalwart
hebrews
the
thanes
at
that
time
thirsting
exceedingly
fain
for

fell
in
the
dust
the
chiefest
part
of
the
chosen
warriors
of
the
staunch
and
the
steadfast
assyrian
leaders
of
the
fated
race
of
the
foe
few
of
them
came
back
alive
to
their
own
land
the
leaders
returned
over
perilous
paths
through
the
piles
of
the
slaughtered
of
reeking
corpses
good
occasion
there
was
for
the
landsmen
to
plunder
their
lifeless
foes
their
ancient
enemies
in
their
armor
laid

bloody
of

of

senseless
on

in

not
easy
of
access

afar
it
was
placed
by
the
might
of
the
maker
from
men
of
sin
the
plain
is
beautiful
a
place
of
blessings
and
filled
with
the
fairest
fragrance
of
earth
matchless
is
that
island
its
maker
unequalled
steadfast
and
strong
of
heart
who
established
that
land
there
are
often
open
to
the
eyes
of
the
blessed
the
happiness
of
the
holy
through

door
that
is
a
winsome
plain
the

are
green

stretching
under

that

is
wholesome
and
unharmed
in
that
happy
land

are
blown
no

there
stand
up

no

there
ever
anything

under

in

this
lovely
land
lieth
higher
by
twelve
full

as

that

winsome
its

never

its
increase
nor

of
its

fair
stand
the
trees
ever
green
as
god
had
given
command
in

the
woodlands
cease
not

be
filled
with

there
fades
not

blighted
nor

through
all

till
the

of
time
till
the
world
shall
fail
when
the
fury
of
waters
over
all
the
earth
in
olden
times
covered
the
world
then
the
wondrous
plain
unharmed
and
unhurt
by
the
heaving
flood
strongly
withstood
and
stemmed
the
waves
blest
and
uninjured
through
the
aid
of
god
thus
blooming
it
abides
till
the
burning
fire
of
the
day
of
doom
when
the
open
and
the
ghastly
graves
shall
give
up
their

no

it
is
the
bidding
of

that
twelve
times
yearly
that
teeming

the
floods
shall
and
fill
with
joy
the

the
beauty
of

bounteously
laden
the
boughs
are
hanging
heavy
with
fruit
that
is
always
new
in

gorgeously
garnished
by

the

the
wood
in

pleasing
prospect

holy
enchanteth
the

no
change
shall
it
know
forever
till
he
ends
his
ancient
plan
his
work
of
wisdom
as
he
willed
it
at
first
ii
in
that
wood
there
dwelleth
a
wondrous
bird
fearless
in
flight
the
phoenix
its
name
lonely
it
liveth
its
life
in
this
place
doughty
of
soul
death
never
seeks
him
in
that
wood
while
the
world
shall
endure
he
is
said
to
watch
the
sun
on
his
way
and
to
go
to
meet
god
bright
candle
that
gleaming
gem
and
gladly
to
note
when
rises
in
radiance
the
most
royal
of
stars
up
from
the
east
over
the
ocean
waves
the
famous
work
of
the
father
fair
with
adornments
the
bright
sign
of
god
buried
are
the
stars
wandering
the
waters
to
the
western
realms
they
grow
dim
at
dawn
and
the
dark
night
creepeth
wanly
away
then
on
wings
of
strength
proud
on
his
pinions
he
placeth
his
gaze
eagerly
on
the
streams
and
stares
over
the
water
where
the
gleam
of
heaven
gliding
shall
come
the
broad
ocean
from
the
bright
east
so
the
wondrous
bird
at
the
water
spring
bideth
in
beauty
in
the
brimming
streams
twelve
times
there
the
triumphant
bird
bathes
in
the
brook
ere
the
beacon
appears
the
candle
of
heaven
and
the
cold
stream
of
the
springs
he
tasteth
from
the
icy
burn
at
every
bath
then
after
his
sport
in
the
springs
at
dawn
filled
full
of
pride
he
flies
to
a
tree
where
most
easily
he
may
in
the
eastern
realm
behold
the
journey
when
the
jewel
of
heaven
over
the
shimmering
sea
the
shining
light
gleameth
in
glory
garnished
is
the
land
the
world
made
beautiful
when
the
blessed
gem
illumines
the
land
the
largest
of
stars
in
the
circle
of
the
seas
sends
forth
its
rays
soon
as
the
sun
over
the
salt
streams
rises
in
glory
then
the
bird
blithely
rises
from
the
beam
where
he
rested
he
fareth
and
flieth
on
high
singing
and
caroling
he
soareth
to
heaven
fair
is
the
famous
fowl
in
his
bearing
with
joy
in
his
breast
in
bliss
exulting
he
warbles
his
song
more
wondrously
sweet
and
choicer
of
note
than
ever
child
of
man
heard
beneath
the
heavens
since
the
high
king
the
worker
of
wonders
the
world
established
heaven
and
earth
his
hymn
is
more
beautiful
and
fairer
by
far
than
all
forms
of
its
singing
surpasseth
the
sweetest
of
music
to
the
song
can
compare
not
the
sound
of
trumpet
nor
of
horn
nor
of
harp
nor
of
heroes
voices
on
all
the
earth
nor
of
organ
sound
nor
singing
song
nor
swan
fair
feathers
nor
of
any
good
thing
that
god
created
as
a
joy
to
men
in
this
mournful
world
thus
he
singeth
and
carolleth
crowned
with
joy
until
the
bright
sun
in
a
southern
sky
sinks
to
its
setting
then
silent
he
is
and
listeneth
and
boweth
and
bendeth
his
head
sage
in
his
thoughts
and
thrice
he
shaketh
his
feathers
for
flight
the
fowl
is
hushed
twelve
equal
times
he
telleth
the
hours
of
day
and
night
is
ordained
in
this
way
and
willed
that
the
dweller
of
the
woods
should
have
joy
pleasure
in
that
plain
and
its
peaceful
bliss
taste
delights
and
life
and
the
land
enjoyments
till
he
waiteth
a
thousand
winters
of
life
the
aged
warden
of
the
ancient
wood
then
the
fowl
in
the
fullness
of
years
is
grievously
stricken
from
the
green
earth
he
fleeth
the
favorite
of
birds
from
the
flowering
land
and
beareth
his
flight
to
a
realm
to
a
distant
domain
where
dwelleth
no
man
as
his
native
land
then
the
noble
fowl
becometh
ruler
over
the
race
of
birds
distinguished
in
their
tribe
and
for
a
time
he
dwelleth
with
them
in
the
waste
then
on
wings
of
strength
he
flieth
to
the
west
full
of
winters
swift
on
his
wing
in
swarms
then
press
the
birds
about
their
lord
all
long
to
serve
him
and
to
live
in
loyalty
to
their
leader
brave
until
he
seeketh
out
the
syrian
land
with
mighty
train
then
turneth
the
pure
one
sharply
away
and
in
the
shade
of
the
forest
he
dwells
in
the
grove
in
the
desert
place
concealed
and
hid
from
the
host
of
men
there
high
on
a
bough
he
abides
alone
under
heaven
roof
hard
by
the
roots
of
a
far
stretching
tree
which
the
phoenix
is
called
by
the
nations
of
earth
from
the
name
of
that
bird
the
king
of
glory
has
granted
that
tree
the
holy
one
of
heaven
as
i
have
heard
said
that
it
among
all
the
other
trees
that
grow
in
the
glorious
groves
of
the
world
bloometh
most
brightly
no
blight
may
hurt
it
nor
work
it
harm
but
while
the
world
stands
it
shall
be
shielded
from
the
shafts
of
evil
iii
when
the
wind
is
at
rest
and
the
weather
is
fair
and
the
holy
gem
of
heaven
is
shining
and
clouds
have
flown
and
the
forces
of
water
are
standing
stilled
and
the
storms
are
all
assuaged
and
soothed
from
the
south
there
gleameth
the
warm
welcomed
by
men
in
the
boughs
the
bird
then
buildeth
its
home
beginneth
its
nest
great
is
its
need
to
work
in
haste
with
the
highest
wisdom
that
his
old
age
he
may
give
to
gain
new
life
a
fair
young
spirit
then
far
and
near
he
gathers
together
to
his
goodly
home
the
winsomest
herbs
and
the
wood
sweet
blossoms
the
fair
perfumes
and
fragrant
shoots
which
were
placed
in
the
world
by
the
wondrous
lord
by
the
father
of
all
on
the
face
of
the
earth
as
a
pleasure
forever
to
the
proud
race
of
men
the
beauty
of
blossoms
there
he
beareth
away
to
that
royal
tree
the
richest
of
treasure
there
the
wild
fowl
in
the
waste
land
on
the
highest
beams
buildeth
his
house
on
the
loftiest
limbs
and
he
liveth
there
in
that
upper
room
on
all
sides
he
surrounds
in
that
shade
unbroken
his
body
and
wings
with
blessed
fragrance
and
fairest
of
blooms
the
most
gorgeous
of
green
things
that
grow
on
the
earth
he
awaiteth
his
journey
when
the
gem
of
heaven
in
the
summer
season
the
sun
at
its
hottest
shineth
over
the
shade
and
shapeth
its
destiny
gazeth
over
the
world
then
it
groweth
warm
his
house
becomes
heated
by
the
heavenly
gleam
the
herbs
wax
hot
the
house
steameth
with
the
sweetest
of
savors
in
the
sweltering
heat
in
the
furious
flame
the
fowl
with
his
nest
is
embraced
by
the
then
burning
seizeth
the
disheartened
one
house
in
hot
haste
riseth
the
fallow
flame
and
the
phoenix
it
reacheth
in
fullness
of
age
then
the
fire
eateth
burneth
the
body
while
borne
is
the
soul
the
fated
one
spirit
where
flesh
and
bone
shall
burn
in
the
blaze
but
it
is
born
anew
attaineth
new
life
at
the
time
allotted
when
the
ashes
again
begin
to
assemble
to
fall
in
a
heap
when
the
fire
is
spent
to
cling
in
a
mass
then
clean
becometh
that
bright
abode
burnt
by
the
fire
the
home
of
the
bird
when
the
body
is
cold
and
its
frame
is
shattered
and
the
fire
slumbers
in
the
funeral
flame
then
is
found
the
likeness
of
an
apple
that
newly
in
the
ashes
appeareth
and
waxeth
into
a
worm
wondrously
fair
as
if
out
from
an
egg
it
had
opened
its
way
shining
from
the
shell
in
the
shade
it
groweth
till
at
first
it
is
formed
like
a
fledgling
eagle
a
fair
young
fowl
then
further
still
it
increaseth
in
stature
till
in
strength
it
is
like
to
a
eagle
and
after
that
with
feathers
fair
as
at
first
it
was
brightly
blooming
then
the
bird
grows
strong
regains
its
brightness
and
is
born
again
sundered
from
sin
somewhat
as
if
one
should
fetch
in
food
the
fruits
of
the
earth
should
haul
it
home
at
harvest
time
the
fairest
of
corn
ere
the
frosts
shall
come
at
the
time
of
reaping
lest
the
rain
in
showers
strike
down
and
destroy
it
a
stay
they
have
ready
a
feast
of
food
when
frost
and
snow
with
their
mighty
coursing
cover
the
earth
in
winter
weeds
the
wealth
of
man
from
those
fair
fruits
shall
flourish
again
through
the
nature
of
grain
which
now
in
the
ground
is
sown
as
clear
seed
then
the
sun
warm
rays
in
time
of
spring
sprouts
the
life
germ
awakes
the
world
riches
so
that
wondrous
fruits
the
treasures
of
earth
by
their
own
kind
are
brought
forth
again
that
bird
changeth
likewise
old
in
his
years
to
youth
again
with
fair
new
flesh
no
food
nor
meat
he
eateth
on
the
earth
save
only
a
taste
of
fine
which
falleth
often
in
the
middle
of
night
the
noble
fowl
thus
feedeth
and
groweth
till
he
flieth
again
to
his
own
domain
to
his
ancient
dwelling
iv
when
the
bird
springs
reborn
from
its
bower
of
herbs
proud
of
pinion
pleased
with
new
life
young
and
full
of
grace
from
the
ground
he
then
skillfully
piles
up
the
scattered
parts
of
the
graceful
body
gathers
the
bones
which
the
funeral
fire
aforetime
devoured
then
brings
altogether
the
bones
and
the
ashes
the
remnant
of
the
flames
he
arranges
anew
and
carefully
covers
that
carrion
spoil
with
fairest
flowers
then
he
fares
away
seeking
the
sacred
soil
of
his
birthplace
with
his
feet
he
fastens
to
the
fire
grim
leavings
clasps
them
in
his
claws
and
his
country
again
the
seat
he
seeks
in
joy
his
own
all
is
renewed
his
body
and
feathers
in
the
form
that
was
his
when
placed
in
the
pleasant
plain
by
his
maker
by
gracious
god
together
he
bringeth
the
bones
of
his
body
which
were
burned
on
the
pyre
which
the
funeral
flames
before
had
enveloped
and
also
the
ashes
then
all
in
a
heap
this
bird
then
burieth
the
bones
and
embers
his
ashes
on
the
island
then
his
eyes
for
the
first
time
catch
sight
of
the
sun
see
in
the
heaven
that
flaming
gem
the
joy
of
the
firmament
which
beams
from
the
east
over
the
ocean
billows
before
is
that
fowl
fair
in
its
plumage
bright
colors
glow
on
its
gorgeous
breast
behind
its
head
is
a
hue
of
green
with
brilliant
crimson
cunningly
blended
the
feathers
of
its
tail
are
fairly
divided
some
brown
some
flaming
some
beautifully
flecked
with
brilliant
spots
at
the
back
his
feathers
are
gleaming
white
green
is
his
neck
both
beneath
and
above
and
the
bill
shines
as
glass
or
a
gem
the
jaws
glisten
within
and
without
the
eye
ball
pierces
and
strongly
stares
with
a
gaze
like
a
gem
that
is
carefully
set
into
a
golden
goblet
by
a
goodly
smith
surrounding
its
neck
like
the
radiant
sun
is
the
brightest
of
rings
braided
with
feathers
its
belly
is
wondrous
with
wealth
of
color
sheer
and
shining
a
shield
extends
brilliantly
fair
above
the
back
of
the
fowl
the
comely
legs
are
covered
with
scales
the
feet
are
bright
yellow
the
fowl
is
in
beauty
peerless
alone
though
like
the
peacock
delightfully
wrought
as
the
writings
relate
it
is
neither
slow
in
movement
nor
sluggish
in
mien
nor
slothful
nor
inert
as
some
birds
are
who
flap
their
wings
in
weary
flight
but
he
is
fast
and
fleet
and
floats
through
the
air
marvelous
winsome
and
wondrously
marked
blessed
is
the
god
who
gave
him
that
bliss
when
at
last
it
leaves
the
land
and
journeys
to
hunt
the
fields
of
its
former
home
as
the
fowl
flieth
many
folk
view
it
it
pleases
in
passing
the
people
of
earth
who
are
seen
assembling
from
south
and
north
they
come
from
the
east
they
crowd
from
the
west
faring
from
afar
the
folk
throng
to
see
the
grace
that
is
given
by
god
in
his
mercy
to
this
fairest
fowl
which
at
first
received
from
gracious
god
the
greatest
of
natures
and
a
beauty
unrivalled
in
the
race
of
birds
then
over
the
earth
all
men
marvel
at
the
freshness
and
fairness
and
make
it
famous
in
writings
with
their
hands
they
mould
it
on
the
hardest
of
marble
which
through
time
and
tide
tells
the
multitudes
of
the
rarity
of
the
flying
one
then
the
race
of
fowls
on
every
hand
enter
in
hosts
surge
in
the
paths
praise
it
in
song
magnify
the
one
in
mighty
strains
and
so
the
holy
one
they
hem
in
in
circles
as
it
flies
amain
the
phoenix
is
in
the
midst
pressed
by
their
hosts
the
people
behold
and
watch
with
wonder
how
the
willing
bands
worship
the
wanderer
one
after
the
other
mightily
proclaim
and
magnify
their
king
their
beloved
lord
they
lead
joyfully
the
noble
one
home
but
now
the
wild
one
flies
away
fast
no
followers
may
come
from
the
happy
host
when
their
head
takes
wing
far
from
this
land
to
find
his
home
v
so
the
dauntless
fowl
after
his
fiery
death
happily
hastens
to
his
home
again
to
his
beauteous
abode
the
birds
return
leaving
their
leader
with
lonely
hearts
again
to
their
land
then
their
gracious
lord
is
young
in
his
courts
the
king
almighty
god
alone
knows
its
nature
by
sex
male
or
female
no
man
can
tell
no
living
being
save
the
lord
only
how
wise
and
wondrous
are
the
ways
of
the
bird
and
the
fair
decree
for
the
fowl
creation
there
the
happy
one
his
home
may
enjoy
with
its
welling
waters
and
woodland
groves
may
live
in
peace
through
the
passing
of
winters
a
thousand
in
number
then
he
knows
again
the
ends
of
his
life
over
him
is
laid
the
funeral
fire
yet
he
finds
life
again
and
wondrously
awakened
he
waxes
in
strength
he
droops
not
nor
dreads
his
death
therefore
the
awful
agony
since
always
he
knows
that
the
lap
of
the
flame
brings
life
afresh
peace
after
death
when
undaunted
once
more
fully
feathered
and
formed
as
a
bird
out
of
the
ashes
up
he
can
spring
safe
under
the
heavens
to
himself
he
is
both
a
father
and
a
son
and
finds
himself
also
ever
the
heir
to
his
olden
life
the
almighty
maker
of
man
has
granted
that
though
the
fire
shall
fasten
its
fetters
upon
him
he
is
given
new
life
and
lives
again
fashioned
with
feathers
as
aforetime
he
was
vi
so
each
living
man
the
life
eternal
seeks
for
himself
after
sorest
cares
that
through
the
darksome
door
of
death
he
may
find
the
goodly
grace
of
god
and
enjoy
forever
and
aye
unending
bliss
as
reward
for
his
work
the
wonders
of
heaven
the
nature
of
this
fowl
is
not
unlike
that
of
those
chosen
as
children
of
god
and
it
shows
men
a
sign
of
how
sacred
joys
granted
by
god
they
may
gain
in
trial
hold
beneath
the
heavens
through
his
holy
grace
and
abide
in
rapture
in
the
realms
above
we
have
found
that
the
faithful
father
created
man
and
woman
through
his
wondrous
might
at
first
in
the
fairest
fields
of
his
earth
he
set
these
sons
on
a
soil
unblemished
in
a
pleasant
place
paradise
named
since
they
lacked
no
delight
as
long
as
the
pair
wisely
heeded
the
holy
word
in
their
new
home
there
hatred
came
the
old
foe
envy
who
offered
them
food
the
fruit
of
the
tree
which
in
folly
they
tried
both
ate
of
the
apple
against
the
order
of
god
tasted
the
forbidden
then
bitter
became
their
woe
after
eating
and
for
their
heirs
as
well
for
sons
and
daughters
a
sorrowful
feast
grievously
were
punished
their
greedy
teeth
for
that
greatest
of
guilt
god
wrath
they
knew
and
bitter
remorse
hence
bearing
their
crimes
their
sons
must
suffer
for
the
sin
of
their
parents
against
god
commands
hence
grieved
in
soul
they
shall
lose
the
delights
of
the
land
of
bliss
through
envy
of
the
serpent
who
deceived
our
elders
in
direful
wise
in
days
of
yore
through
his
wicked
heart
so
that
they
went
far
hence
to
the
dale
of
death
to
doleful
life
in
a
sorrowful
home
hidden
from
them
was
the
blessed
life
and
the
blissful
plain
by
the
fiend
cunning
was
fastened
close
for
many
winters
till
the
maker
of
wonders
the
king
of
mankind
comforter
of
the
weary
our
only
hope
hither
came
down
to
the
godly
band
and
again
held
it
open
vii
his
advent
is
likened
by
learned
writers
in
their
works
of
wisdom
and
words
of
truth
to
the
flight
of
that
fowl
when
forth
he
goes
from
his
own
country
and
becometh
old
weighed
with
winters
weary
in
mind
and
finds
in
wandering
the
forest
wood
where
a
bower
he
builds
with
branches
and
herbs
with
rarest
of
twigs
he
raises
his
dwelling
his
nest
in
the
wood
great
need
he
hath
that
he
gain
again
his
gladsome
youth
in
the
flame
of
fire
that
he
may
find
new
life
renew
his
youth
and
his
native
home
his
sunbright
seat
he
may
seek
again
after
his
bath
of
fire
so
abandoned
before
us
the
first
of
our
parents
their
fairest
plain
their
happy
home
their
hope
of
glory
to
fare
afar
on
a
fearful
journey
where
hostile
hands
harshly
beset
them
evil
ones
often
injured
them
sorely
yet
many
men
marked
well
the
lord
heeded
his
behests
in
holy
customs
in
glorious
deeds
so
that
god
their
redeemer
the
high
hearkened
to
them
that
is
the
high
tree
wherein
holy
men
hide
their
home
from
the
harm
of
their
foe
and
know
no
peril
neither
with
poison
nor
with
treacherous
token
in
time
of
evil
there
god
warrior
works
him
a
nest
with
doughty
deeds
dangers
avoids
he
distributes
alms
to
the
stricken
and
needy
he
tells
graceless
men
of
the
mercy
of
god
of
the
father
help
he
hastens
forth
lessening
the
perils
of
this
passing
life
its
darksome
deeds
and
does
god
will
with
bravery
in
his
breast
his
bidding
he
seeks
in
prayer
with
pure
heart
and
pliant
knee
bent
to
the
earth
all
evil
is
banished
all
grim
offences
by
his
fear
of
god
happy
in
heart
he
hopes
full
well
to
do
good
deeds
the
redeemer
is
his
shield
in
his
varied
walks
the
wielder
of
victory
to
people
those
plants
are
the
ones
the
flowers
of
fruit
which
the
fowl
of
wildness
finds
in
this
world
from
far
and
wide
and
brings
to
his
abode
where
it
builds
a
nest
with
firmness
of
heart
against
fear
and
hatred
so
in
that
place
god
soldiers
perform
with
courage
and
might
the
creator
commands
then
they
gain
them
glory
they
are
given
rewards
by
the
gracious
god
for
their
goodness
of
heart
from
those
is
made
a
pleasant
dwelling
as
reward
for
their
works
in
the
wondrous
city
since
they
held
in
their
hearts
the
holy
teachings
serving
their
lord
with
loving
souls
by
day
and
by
night
and
never
ceasing
with
fervent
faith
preferring
their
lord
above
worldly
wealth
they
ween
not
indeed
that
long
they
will
live
in
this
life
that
is
fleeting
a
blessed
earl
earns
by
his
virtue
a
home
in
heaven
with
the
highest
king
and
comfort
forever
this
he
earns
ere
the
close
of
his
days
in
the
world
when
death
the
warrior
greedy
for
warfare
girded
with
weapons
seeketh
each
life
and
sendeth
quickly
into
the
bosom
of
the
earth
those
deserted
bodies
lorn
of
their
souls
where
long
they
shall
bide
covered
with
clay
till
the
coming
of
the
fire
many
of
the
sons
of
men
into
the
assembly
are
led
by
the
leaders
the
lord
of
angels
the
father
almighty
the
master
of
hosts
will
judge
with
justice
the
joyful
and
the
sad
then
mortal
men
in
a
mass
shall
arise
as
the
righteous
king
the
ruler
of
angels
the
savior
of
souls
said
it
must
be
gave
command
by
the
trumpet
to
the
tribes
of
the
world
then
ends
darkest
death
for
those
dear
to
the
lord
through
the
grace
of
god
the
good
shall
depart
in
clamoring
crowds
when
this
cruel
world
shall
burst
into
flames
into
baleful
fire
the
earth
shall
end
then
all
shall
have
most
frightful
fear
when
the
fire
crashes
over
earth
fleeting
fortunes
when
the
flame
eats
up
its
olden
treasures
eagerly
graspeth
on
goodly
gold
and
greedily
consumes
the
land
adornments
then
dawns
in
light
in
that
awesome
hour
for
all
of
men
the
fair
and
sacred
symbol
of
the
fowl
when
the
mighty
ruler
shall
arouse
all
men
shall
gather
together
from
the
grave
the
bones
the
limbs
of
the
body
those
left
from
the
flame
before
the
knee
of
christ
the
king
in
splendor
from
his
lofty
seat
shall
give
light
to
the
holy
the
gem
of
glory
it
will
be
joyous
and
gladsome
to
the
servers
of
truth
in
that
sad
time
viii
there
the
bodies
bathed
of
their
sins
shall
go
in
gladness
again
shall
their
spirits
to
their
bony
frames
and
the
fire
shall
burn
mounting
high
to
heaven
hot
shall
be
to
many
that
awful
flame
when
every
man
unblemished
or
sinful
his
soul
in
his
body
from
the
depths
of
his
grave
seeks
the
doom
of
god
frightfully
afraid
the
fire
shall
save
men
burning
all
sin
so
shall
the
blessed
after
weary
wandering
with
their
works
be
clothed
with
the
fruit
of
their
deeds
fair
are
these
roots
these
winsome
flowers
that
the
wild
fowl
collects
to
lay
on
his
lovely
nest
in
order
that
easily
his
own
fair
home
may
burn
in
the
sun
and
himself
along
with
it
and
so
after
the
fire
he
finds
him
new
life
so
every
man
in
all
the
world
shall
be
covered
with
flesh
fair
and
comely
and
always
young
if
his
own
choice
leads
him
to
work
god
will
then
the
world
high
king
mighty
at
the
meeting
mercy
will
grant
him
then
the
hymns
shall
rise
high
from
the
holy
band
the
chosen
souls
shall
chant
their
songs
in
praise
of
the
powerful
prince
of
men
strain
upon
strain
and
strengthened
and
fragrant
of
their
godly
works
they
shall
wend
to
glory
then
are
men
spirits
made
spotless
and
bright
through
the
flame
of
the
fire
refined
and
made
pure
in
all
the
earth
let
not
anyone
ween
that
i
wrought
this
lay
with
lying
speech
with
hated
hear
ye
the
wisdom
of
the
hymns
of
job
with
heart
of
joy
and
spirit
brave
he
boldly
spoke
with
wondrous
sanctity
that
word
he
said
i
feel
it
a
fact
in
the
fastness
of
my
soul
that
one
day
in
my
nest
death
i
shall
know
and
weary
of
heart
woefully
go
hence
compassed
with
clay
on
my
closing
journey
mournful
of
mind
in
the
moldy
earth
and
through
the
gift
of
god
i
shall
gain
once
more
like
the
phoenix
fowl
a
fair
new
life
on
the
day
of
arising
from
ruinous
death
delights
with
god
where
the
loving
throng
are
exalting
their
lord
i
look
not
at
all
ever
to
come
to
the
end
of
that
life
of
light
and
bliss
though
my
body
shall
lie
in
its
gruesome
grave
and
grow
decayed
a
joy
to
worms
for
the
judge
of
the
world
shall
save
my
soul
and
send
it
to
glory
after
the
time
of
death
i
shall
trust
forever
with
steadfast
breast
in
the
strength
of
angels
firm
is
my
faith
in
the
father
of
all
thus
sang
the
sage
his
song
of
old
herald
to
god
with
gladsome
heart
how
he
was
lifted
to
life
eternal
then
we
may
truly
interpret
the
token
clearly
which
the
glorious
bird
gave
through
its
burning
it
gathers
together
the
grim
the
ashes
and
embers
all
into
one
place
after
the
surge
of
the
fire
the
fowl
then
seizes
it
with
its
feet
and
flies
to
the
father
garden
towards
the
sun
for
a
time
there
he
sojourns
for
many
winters
made
in
new
wise
all
of
him
young
nor
may
any
there
yearn
to
do
him
menace
with
deeds
of
malice
so
may
after
death
by
the
redeemer
might
souls
go
with
bodies
bound
together
fashioned
in
loveliness
most
like
to
that
fowl
in
rich
array
with
rare
perfumes
where
the
steadfast
sun
streams
its
light
the
sacred
hosts
in
the
happy
city
ix
then
high
over
the
roofs
the
holy
ruler
shines
on
the
souls
of
the
saved
and
the
loyal
radiant
fowls
follow
around
him
brightest
of
birds
in
bliss
exulting
the
chosen
and
joyous
ones
join
him
at
home
forever
and
ever
where
no
evil
is
wrought
by
the
foulest
fiend
in
his
fickle
deceit
but
they
shall
live
in
lasting
light
and
beauty
as
the
phoenix
fowl
in
the
faith
of
god
every
one
of
men
works
in
that
wondrous
home
in
that
blissful
abode
brightly
shines
forth
in
the
peaceful
presence
of
the
prince
eternal
who
resembles
the
sun
a
sacred
crown
most
richly
wrought
with
radiant
gems
high
over
the
head
of
each
holy
soul
glitters
refulgent
their
foreheads
gleam
covered
with
glory
the
crown
of
god
embellishes
beautifully
the
blessed
host
with
light
in
that
life
where
lasting
joy
is
fresh
and
young
and
fades
not
away
but
they
dwell
in
bliss
adorned
in
beauty
with
fairest
ornaments
with
the
father
angels
they
see
no
sorrow
in
those
sacred
courts
no
sin
nor
suffering
nor
sad
no
burning
hunger
nor
bitter
thirst
no
evil
nor
age
but
ever
their
king
granteth
his
grace
to
the
glorious
band
that
loves
its
lord
and
everlasting
king
that
glorifies
and
praises
the
power
of
god
that
host
round
the
holy
throne
makes
then
melody
in
mighty
strains
the
blessed
saints
blithely
sing
in
unison
with
angels
orisons
to
the
lord
peace
to
thee
o
god
thou
proud
monarch
thou
ruler
reigning
with
righteousness
and
skill
thanks
for
thy
goodly
gifts
to
us
all
mighty
and
measureless
is
thy
majesty
and
strength
high
and
holy
the
heavens
o
lord
are
fairly
filled
o
father
almighty
glory
of
glories
in
greatness
ruling
among
angels
above
and
on
earth
beneath
guard
us
o
god
of
creation
thou
governest
all
things
lord
of
the
highest
heavens
above
so
shall
the
saints
sing
his
praises
those
free
from
sin
in
that
fairest
of
cities
proclaim
his
power
the
righteous
people
the
host
in
heaven
hail
the
redeemer
honor
without
end
is
only
for
him
not
ever
at
all
had
he
any
birth
any
beginning
of
bliss
though
he
was
born
in
the
world
on
this
earth
in
the
image
of
an
innocent
child
with
unfailing
justice
and
fairest
judgments
high
above
the
heavens
in
holiness
he
dwelt
though
he
must
endure
the
death
of
the
cross
bear
the
bitter
burden
of
men
when
three
days
have
passed
after
the
death
of
his
body
he
regains
new
life
through
the
love
of
god
through
the
aid
of
the
father
so
the
phoenix
betokens
in
his
youthful
state
the
strength
of
christ
who
in
a
wondrous
wise
awakes
from
the
ashes
unto
the
life
of
life
with
limbs
begirded
so
the
savior
sought
to
aid
us
through
the
loss
of
his
body
life
without
end
likewise
that
fowl
filleth
his
wings
loads
them
with
sweet
and
scented
roots
with
winsome
flowers
and
flies
away
these
are
the
words
wise
men
tell
us
the
songs
of
the
holy
ones
whose
souls
go
to
heaven
with
the
loving
lord
to
live
for
aye
in
bliss
of
bliss
where
they
bring
to
god
their
words
and
their
works
wondrous
in
savor
as
a
precious
gift
in
that
glorious
place
in
that

it
appears
in
the
chronicle
for
battle
of
treats
not
of
legendary
heroes
of
the
germanic
races
but
of
an
actual
historic
personage
an
english
hero
and
patriot
fallen
in
battle
against
a
foreign
invader
a
very
short
time
before
the
poem
was
made
a
single
event
in
contemporary
history
is
here
described
with
hardly
suppressed
emotion
by
one
who
knew
his
hero
and
loved
him
there
is
none
of
the
allusiveness
and
excursiveness
of
the
we
have
here
not
a
member
of
an
epic
cycle
but
an
independent
song
very
striking
is
the
absence
of
ornament
from
the
of
all
is
plain
blunt
and
stern
sedgefield
battle
of
pp
was
broken
he
bade
the
young
barons
abandon
their
horses
to
drive
them
afar
and
dash
quickly
forth
in
their
hands
and
brave
heart
to
put
all
hope
of
success
the
kinsman
of
offa
discovered
then
first
that
the
earl
would
not
brook
dishonorable
bearing
he
held
in
his
hand
the
hawk
that
he
loved
let
him
fly
to
the
fields
to
the
fight
then
he
stepped
by
this
one
could
know
that
the
knight
was
unwilling
to
weaken
in
war
when
his
weapons
he
seized
edric
wished
also
to
aid
his
chief
his
in
fight
forward
he
bore
his
brand
to
the
battle
a
brave
heart
he
had
so
long
as
he
held
locked
in
his
hand
his
board
and
his
broad
sword
his
boast
he
made
good
fearless
to
fight
before
his
lord
then
byrhtnoth
began
to
embolden
the
warriors
he
rode
and
counseled
them
his
comrades
he
taught
how
they
should
stand
in
the
stronghold
defence
bade
them
to
bear
their
bucklers
correctly
fast
by
their
hands
without
fear
in
their
hearts
when
the
folk
by
fair
words
he
had
fired
with
zeal
he
alighted
in
a
crowd
of
his
loyal
comrades
where
he
felt
that
his
friends
were
most
faithful
and
true
then
he
stood
on
the
strand
sternly
the
messenger
of
the
vikings
called
in
vaunting
words
brought
him
the
boast
of
the
bloody
seamen
the
errand
to
the
earl
at
the
edge
of
the
water
i
am
sent
to
thee
by
seamen
bold
they
bade
me
summon
thee
to
send
them
quickly
rings
for
a
ransom
and
rather
than
fight
it
is
better
for
you
to
bargain
with
gold
than
that
we
should
fiercely
fight
you
in
battle
it
is
futile
to
fight
if
you
fill
our
demands
if
you
give
us
gold
we
will
grant
you
a
truce
if
commands
thou
wilt
make
who
art
mightiest
of

that
thy
folk
shall
be
free
from
the
foemen
attack
shall
give
of
their
wealth
at
the
will
of
the

a
treasure
for
tribute
with
a
truce
in
return
we
will
go

again

vouchsafe
to
you

burst
forth
his
buckler
he
grasped
his
spear
he
seized
and
spoke
in
words
full
of
anger
and
ire
and
answer
he
gave
dost
thou
hear
oh
seamen
what
our
heroes
say
spears
they
will
send
to
the
sailors
as
tribute
poisoned
points
and

swords
and
such
weapons

as
shall
win
you
no

envoy
of
vikings
your
vauntings
return
fare
to
thy
folk
with
a
far
sterner
message
that
here
staunchly
stands
with
his
steadfast
troops
the
lord
that
will
fight
for
the
land
of
his
fathers
for
the
realm
of
æthelred
my
royal
chief
for
his
folk
and
his
fold
fallen
shall
lie
the
heathen
at
shameful
i
deem
it
with
our
treasure
as
tribute
that
you
take
to
your
ships
without
facing
a
fight
since
thus
far
hither
you
have
come
and
encroached
on
our
king
domain
you
shall
not
so
easily
earn
our
treasure
you
must
prove
your
power
with
point
and
sword

with
grim
war
grip
ere
we
grant
you
tribute
he
bade
then
his
band
to
bear
forth
their
shields
until
they
arrived
at
the
river
bank
the
waters
prevented
the
warriors
encounter
the
tide
flowed
in
the
flood
after
the
ebb
locked
up
the
land
too
long
it
seemed
until
they
could
meet
and
mingle
their
spears
by
panta
stream
they
stood
in
array
the
east
saxon
army
and
the
eager
each
troop
was
helpless
to
work
harm
on
the
other
save
the
few
who
were
felled
by
a
flight
of
arrows
the
flood
receded
the
sailors
stood
ready
all
of
the
vikings
eager
for
victory
byrhtnoth
bade
the
bridge
to
be
defended
the
warrior
by
wulfstan
the
bold
with
his
crowd
of
kinsmen
he
was
ceola
son
and
he
felled
the
first
of
the
foemen
who
stepped
on
the
bridge
the
boldest
of
the
band
of
men
there
waited
with
wulfstan
the
warriors
undaunted
ælfhere
and
maccus
men
of
courage
at
the
ford
not
a
foot
would
they
flee
the
encounter
but
close
in
conflict
they
clashed
with
the
foe
as
long
as
they
wielded
their
weapons
with
strength
as
soon
as
they
saw
and
perceived
it
clearly
how
fiercely
fought
was
the
defense
of
the
bridge
the
treacherous
tribe
in
trickery
asked
that
they
be
allowed
to
lead
their
hosts
for
a
closer
conflict
to
cross
over
the
ford
then
the
earl
too
eager
to
enter
the
fight
allowed
too
much
land
to
the
loathed
pirates
clearly
then

west
over

over
the
bright

they
bore
their

he
bade
them
with

to

a

and
to

stoutly
fast
holding
the
foe
the
fight
was
near
the
triumph
at
conflict
the
time
had
come
when
fated
men
should
fall
in
battle
then
arose
an
alarm
the
ravens
soared
the
eagle
eager
for
prey
on

was
commotion
then
sped
from
their
hands
the
hardened
spears
flew
in
fury
darts

javelins
cruel
was
the
conflict
in

wounded
to

was
strongly
stricken

to

vikings
quickly
requital
was
given
i
learned
that
edward
alone
attacked
stoutly
with
his
sword
not
stinting
his
blows
so
that
fell
at
his
feet
many
fated
invaders
for
his
prowess
the
prince
gave
praise
and
thanks
to
his
chamberlain
brave
when
chance
would
permit
so
firm
of
purpose
they
fought
in
their
turn
young
men
in
battle
they
yearned
especially
to
lead
their
line
with
the
least
delay
to
fight
their
foes
in
fatal
conflict
warriors
with
weapons
the
world
seethed
with
slaughter
steadfast
they
stood
stirred
up
by
byrhtnoth
he
bade
his
thanes
to
think
on
battle
and
fight
for
fame
with
the
foemen
danes
the
fierce
warrior
went
his
weapon
he
raised
his
shield
for
a
shelter
to
the
soldier
he
came
the
chief
to
the
churl
a
challenge
addressed
each
to
the
other
had
evil
intent
the
seamen
then
sent
from
the
south
a
spear
so
that
wounded
lay
the
lord
of
the
warriors
he
shoved
with
his
shield
till
the
shaft
was
broken
and
burst
the
spear
till
back
it
sprang
enraged
was
the
daring
one
he
rushed
with
his
dart
on
the
wicked
warrior
who
had
wounded
him
sore
sage
was
the
soldier
he
sent
his
javelin
through
the
grim
youth
neck
he
guided
his
hand
and
furiously
felled
his
foeman
dead
straightway
another
he
strongly
attacked
and
burst
his
burnie
in
his
breast
he
wounded
him
through
his
hard
in
his
heart
there
stood
the
poisoned
point
pleased
was
the
earl
loudly
he
laughed
to
the
lord
he
gave
thanks
for
the
deeds
of
the
day
the
redeemer
had
granted
a
hostile
youth
hurled
from
his
hand
a
dart
the
spear
in
flight
then
sped
too
far
and
the
honorable
earl
of
æthelred
fell
by
his
side
there
stood
a
stripling
youth
a
boy
in
battle
who
boldly
drew
the
bloody
brand
from
the
breast
of
his
chief
the
young
wulfmere
wulfstan
son
gave
back
again
the
gory
the
point
pierced
home
so
that
prostrate
lay
the
viking
whose
valor
had
vanquished
the
earl
to
the
earl
then
went
an
armed
warrior
he
sought
to
snatch
and
seize
his
rings
his
booty
and
bracelets
his
bright
shining
sword
byrhtnoth
snatched
forth
the
weapon
from
his
sheath
and
sharply
shook
the
attacker
certain
of
the
seamen
too
soon
joined
against
him
as
he
checked
the
arm
of
the
charging
enemy
now
sank
to
the
ground
his
golden
brand
he
might
not
hold
the
hilt
of
his
mace
nor
wield
his
weapons
these
words
still
he
spoke
to
embolden
the
youths
the
hero
called
on
his
comrades
to
conquer
their
foes
he
no
longer
had
strength
to
stand
on
his
feet
he
looked
to
heaven
ruler
of
realms
i
render
thee
thanks

they
lost

then
fled
from
the
fray
those
who
feared
to
remain
first
in
the
frantic
flight
was
godric
the
son
of
odda
he
forsook
his
chief
who
had
granted
him
gifts
of
goodly
horses
lightly
he
leapt
on
his
lord
own
steed
in
its
royal
array
no
right
had
he
to
it
his
brothers
also
the
battle
forsook
godwin
and
godwy
made
good
their
escape
and
went
to
the
wood
for
the
war
they
disliked
they
fled
to
the
fastnesses
in
fear
of
their
lives
and
many
more
of
the
men
than
was
fitting
had
they
freshly
in
mind
remembered
the
favors
the
good
deeds
he
had
done
them
in
days
of
old

were
the
words
spoken
once
by

he
sat
with

boast
in

they

urged
by

that
brings
me
most
grief
he
was
not

my

then
harboring

war
while
his

he
may
have

the

used
bright
pp
ff
in
the
monastery
of
this
abbess
hild
was
a
certain
brother
especially
distinguished
and
gifted
with
the
grace
of
god
because
he
was
in
the
habit
of
making
poems
filled
with
piety
and
virtue
whatever
he
learned
of
holy
writ
through
interpreters
he
gave
forth
in
a
very
short
time
in
poetical
language
with
the
greatest
of
sweetness
and
inspiration
well
wrought
in
the
english
tongue
because
of
his
songs
the
minds
of
many
men
were
turned
from
the
thoughts
of
this
world
and
incited
toward
a
contemplation
of
the
heavenly
life
there
were
to
be
sure
others
after
him
among
the
angles
who
tried
to
compose
sacred
poetry
but
none
of
them
could
equal
him
because
his
instruction
in
poetry
was
not
at
all
from
men
nor
through
the
aid
of
any
man
but
it
was
through
divine
inspiration
and
as
a
gift
from
god
that
he
received
the
power
of
song
for
that
reason
he
was
never
able
to
compose
poetry
of
a
light
or
idle
nature
but
only
the
one
kind
that
pertained
to
religion
and
was
fitted
to
the
tongue
of
a
godly
singer
such
as
he
this
man
had
lived
the
life
of
a
layman
until
he
was
somewhat
advanced
in
years
and
had
never
learned
any
songs
for
this
reason
often
at
the
banquets
where
for
the
sake
of
merriment
it
was
ruled
that
they
should
all
sing
in
turn
at
the
harp
when
he
would
see
the
harp
approach
him
he
would
arise
from
the
company
out
of
shame
and
go
home
to
his
house
on
one
occasion
he
had
done
this
and
had
left
the
banquet
hall
and
gone
out
to
the
stable
to
the
cattle
which
it
was
his
duty
to
guard
that
night
then
in
due
time
he
lay
down
and
slept
and
there
stood
before
him
in
his
dream
a
man
who
hailed
him
and
greeted
him
and
called
him
by
name
cædmon
sing
me
something
then
he
answered
and
said
i
can
not
sing
anything
and
for
that
reason
i
left
the
banquet
and
came
here
since
i
could
not
sing
once
more
the
man
who
was
speaking
with
him
said
no
matter
you
must
sing
for
me
then
he
answered
what
shall
i
sing
thereupon
the
stranger
said
sing
to
me
of
the
beginning
of
things
when
he
had
received
this
answer
he
began
forthwith
to
sing
in
praise
of
god
the
creator
verses
and
words
that
he
had
never
heard
in
the
following
manner
now
shall
we
praise
the
prince
of
heaven
the
might
of
the
maker
and
his
manifold
thought
the
work
of
the
father
of
what
wonders
he
wrought
the
lord
everlasting
when
he
laid
out
the
worlds
he
first
raised
up
for
the
race
of
men
the
heaven
as
a
roof
the
holy
ruler
then
the
world
below
the
ward
of
mankind
the
lord
everlasting
at
last
established
as
a
home
for
man
the
almighty
lord
then
he
arose
from
his
sleep
and
all
that
he
had
sung
while
asleep
he
held
fast
in
memory
and
soon
afterward
he
added
many
words
like
unto
them
befitting
a
hymn
to
god
the
next
morning
he
came
to
the
steward
who
was
his
master
and
told
him
of
the
gift
he
had
received
the
steward
immediately
led
him
to
the
abbess
and
related
what
he
had
heard
she
bade
assemble
all
the
wise
and
learned
men
and
asked
cædmon
to
relate
his
dream
in
their
presence
and
to
sing
the
song
that
they
might
give
their
judgment
as
to
what
it
was
or
whence
it
had
come
they
all
agreed
that
it
was
a
divine
gift
bestowed
from
heaven
they
then
explained
to
him
a
piece
of
holy
teaching
and
bade
him
if
he
could
to
turn
that
into
rhythmic
verse
when
he
received
the
instruction
of
the
learned
men
he
departed
for
his
house
in
the
morning
he
returned
and
delivered
the
passage
assigned
him
turned
into
an
excellent
poem
thereupon
the
abbess
praising
and
honoring
the
gift
of
god
in
this
man
persuaded
him
to
leave
the
condition
of
a
layman
and
take
monastic
vows
and
this
he
did
with
great
eagerness
she
received
him
and
his
household
into
the
monastery
and
made
him
one
of
the
company
of
servants
and
commanded
that
he
be
taught
the
holy
writings
and
stories
he
on
his
part
pondered
on
all
that
he
learned
by
word
of
mouth
and
just
as
a
clean
beast
chews
on
a
cud
transformed
it
into
the
sweetest
of
poetry
his
songs
and
poems
were
so
pleasing
that
even
his
teachers
came
to
learn
and
write
what
he
spoke
he
sang
first
of
the
creation
of
the
earth
and
of
the
origin
of
mankind
and
all
the
story
of
genesis
the
first
book
of
moses
and
afterwards
of
the
exodus
of
the
children
of
israel
from
the
land
of
egypt
and
the
entry
into
the
promised
land
and
many
other
stories
of
the
holy
scriptures
the
incarnation
of
christ
and
his
suffering
and
his
ascension
into
heaven
the
coming
of
the
holy
ghost
and
the
teaching
of
the
apostles
and
finally
he
wrote
many
songs
concerning
the
future
day
of
judgment
and
of
the
fearfulness
of
the
pains
of
hell
and
the
bliss
of
heaven
besides
these
he
composed
many
others
concerning
the
mercies
and
judgments
of
god
in
all
of
these
he
strove
especially
to
lead
men
from
the
love
of
sin
and
wickedness
and
to
impel
them
toward
the
love
and
practice
of
righteousness
for
he
was
a
very
pious
man
and
submissive
to
the
rules
of
the
monastery
and
he
burned
with
zeal
against
those
who
acted
otherwise
for
this
reason
it
was
that
his
life
ended
with
a
fair
death

sends
greetings
to
wærferth
in
loving
and
friendly
words
i
let
thee
know
that
it
has
often
come
to
my
mind
what
wise
men
there
were
formerly
throughout
england
among
both
the
clergy
and
the
laity
and
what
happy
times
there
were
then
throughout
england
and
how
the
kings
who
held
sway
over
the
people
in
those
days
obeyed
god
and
his
ministers
and
how
they
preserved
not
only
their
peace
but
their
morality
also
and
good
order
at
home
and
extended
their
possessions
abroad
and
how
prosperous
they
were
both
with
war
and
with
wisdom
and
how
zealous
the
clergy
were
both
in
teaching
and
in
learning
and
in
all
the
services
they
owed
to
god
and
how
foreigners
came
to
the
land
in
search
of
wisdom
and
learning
and
how
we
should
now
have
to
secure
them
from
abroad
if
we
were
to
have
them
so
complete
was
this
decay
in
england
that
there
were
very
few
on
this
side
of
the
humber
who
could
understand
their
rituals
in
english
or
translate
a
latin
letter
into
english
and
i
feel
sure
that
there
were
not
many
beyond
humber
so
few
there
were
that
i
can
not
remember
a
single
one
south
of
the
thames
when
i
began
to
reign
almighty
god
be
thanked
that
we
have
any
teachers
among
us
now
then
i
considered
all
this
and
brought
to
mind
also
how
before
it
had
all
been
laid
waste
and
burned
the
churches
throughout
all
england
stood
filled
with
treasures
and
books
and
there
was
a
great
multitude
of
god
servants
but
they
knew
very
little
about
the
books
for
they
could
not
understand
anything
in
them
since
they
were
not
written
in
their
own
language
as
if
they
spoke
thus
our
fathers
who
held
these
places
of
old

wisdom
and
through
it
acquired
wealth
and
bequeathed
it
to
us
here
we
may
still
see
their
tracks
but
we
can
not
follow
them
and
hence
we
have
now
lost
both
the
wealth
and
the
wisdom
since
we
would
not
incline
our
hearts
after
their
example
when
i
called
all
this
to
mind
i
wondered
very
much
considering
all
the
good
and
wise
men
who
were
formerly
throughout
england
and
all
the
books
that
they
had
perfectly
learned
that
they
had
translated
no
part
of
them
into
their
own
language
but
soon
i
answered
myself
and
said
they
did
not
expect
that
men
should
ever
become
as
careless
and
that
learning
should
decay
as
it
has
they
neglected
it
through
the
desire
that
the
greater
increase
of
wisdom
there
should
be
in
the
land
the
more
should
men
learn
of
foreign
languages
i
then
considered
that
the
law
was
first
found
in
the
hebrew
tongue
and
again
when
the
greeks
learned
it
they
translated
it
all
into
their
own
language
and
the
romans
likewise
when
they
had
learned
it
they
translated
it
all
through
learned
scholars
into
their
own
language
and
all
other
christian
people
have
turned
some
part
into
their
own
language
wherefore
it
seems
to
me
best
if
it
seems
so
to
you
that
we
should
translate
some
books
that
are
most
needful
for
all
men
to
know
into
the
language
which
we
can
all
understand
and
that
we
should
bring
about
what
we
may
very
easily
do
with
god
help
if
we
have
tranquillity
namely
that
all
youths
that
are
now
in
england
of
free
birth
who
are
rich
enough
to
devote
themselves
to
it
be
put
to
learning
as
long
as
they
are
not
fitted
for
any
other
occupation
until
the
time
that
they
shall
be
able
to
read
english
writing
with
ease
and
let
those
that
would
pursue
their
studies
further
be
taught
more
in
latin
and
be
promoted
to
a
higher
rank
when
i
brought
to
mind
how
the
knowledge
of
latin
had
formerly
decayed
throughout
england
and
yet
many
knew
how
to
read
english
writing
i
began
among
other
various
and
manifold
troubles
of
this
kingdom
to
turn
into
english
the
book
that
is
called
in
latin
and
in
english
shepherd
sometimes
word
for
word
sometimes
thought
by
thought
as
i
had
learned
it
from
plegmund
my
archbishop
and
asser
my
bishop
and
grimbald
my
priest
and
john
my
priest
after
i
had
learned
it
so
that
i
understood
it
and
so
that
i
could
interpret
it
clearly
i
translated
it
into
english
i
shall
send
one
copy
to
every
bishopric
in
my
kingdom
and
in
each
is
a
worth
fifty
mancuses
and
i
command
in
god
name
that
no
man
take
the
from
the
monastery
it
is
not
certain
that
there
will
be
such
learned
bishops
as
thanks
be
to
god
we
now
have
nearly
everywhere
hence
i
wish
the
books
to
remain
always
in
their
places
unless
the
bishop
wishes
to
take
them
with
him
or
they
be
lent
out
anywhere
or
any
one
be
copying
them
the

bright
line
line
when
the
king
heard
these
words
he
answered
him
paulinus
who
had
been
preaching
christianity
to
him
and
said
that
he
was
not
only
willing
but
expected
to
accept
the
faith
that
he
taught
the
king
said
however
that
he
wished
to
have
speech
and
counsel
with
his
friends
and
advisers
so
that
if
they
accepted
the
faith
with
him
they
might
all
together
be
consecrated
to
christ
the
fountain
of
life
the
bishop
consented
and
the
king
did
as
he
said
he
now
counselled
and
advised
with
his
wise
men
and
he
asked
of
each
of
them
separately
what
he
thought
of
the
new
doctrine
and
the
worship
of
god
that
was
preached
cefi
the
chief
of
his
priests
then
answered
consider
oh
king
what
this
teaching
is
that
is
now
delivered
to
us
i
declare
to
you
i
have
learned
for
a
certainty
that
the
religion
we
have
had
up
to
the
present
has
neither
virtue
nor
usefulness
in
it
for
none
of
thy
servants
has
applied
himself
more
diligently
to
the
worship
of
our
gods
than
i
and
nevertheless
there
are
many
who
receive
greater
gifts
and
favors
from
thee
than
i
and
are
more
prosperous
in
all
their
undertakings
i
know
well
that
our
gods
if
they
had
had
any
power
would
have
rewarded
me
more
because
i
have
more
faithfully
served
and
obeyed
them
it
seems
to
me
therefore
wise
if
you
consider
that
these
new
doctrines
which
are
preached
to
us
are
better
and
more
efficacious
to
receive
them
immediately
assenting
to
his
words
another
of
the
king
wise
men
and
chiefs
spoke
further
o
king
this
present
life
of
man
on
earth
seems
to
me
in
comparison
with
the
time
that
is
unknown
to
us
as
if
thou
wert
sitting
at
a
feast
with
thine
eldermen
and
thanes
in
the
winter
time
and
the
fire
burned
brightly
and
thy
hall
was
warm
and
it
rained
and
snowed
and
stormed
outside
there
comes
then
a
sparrow
and
flies
quickly
through
thy
house
in
through
one
door
he
comes
through
the
other
door
he
goes
out
again
as
long
as
he
is
within
he
is
not
rained
on
by
the
winter
storm
but
after
a
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
a
mere
moment
he
goes
immediately
from
winter
back
to
winter
again
likewise
this
life
of
man
appeareth
for
a
little
time
but
what
goes
before
or
what
comes
after
we
know
not
if
therefore
this
teaching
can
tell
us
anything
more
satisfying
or
certain
it
seems
worthy
to
be
followed
the
voyages
of
ohthere
and
wulfstan
from
alfred
version
of

of

pp
ff
ohthere
voyages
ohthere
told
his
lord
king
alfred
that
he
dwelt
the
farthest
north
of
all
the
northmen
he
said
that
he
lived
in
the
northern
part
of
the
land
toward
the
west
sea
he
reported
however
that
the
land
extended
very
far
north
thence
but
that
it
was
all
waste
except
in
a
few
places
here
and
there
where
the
finns
dwell
engaged
in
hunting
in
winter
and
sea
fishing
in
summer
he
said
that
on
one
occasion
he
wished
to
find
out
how
far
the
land
lay
northward
or
whether
any
man
inhabited
the
waste
land
to
the
north
then
he
fared
northward
to
the
land
for
three
days
there
was
waste
land
on
his
starboard
and
the
wide
sea
on
his
larboard
then
he
had
come
as
far
north
as
the
whale
hunters
ever
go
whereupon
he
journeyed
still
northward
as
far
as
he
could
in
three
days
sailing
at
that
place
the
land
bent
to
the
east
or
the
sea
in
on
the
land
he
knew
not
which
but
he
knew
that
there
he
waited
for
a
west
wind
or
somewhat
from
the
northwest
and
then
sailed
east
near
the
land
as
far
as
he
could
in
four
days
there
he
had
to
wait
for
a
wind
from
due
north
since
there
the
land
bent
due
south
or
the
sea
in
on
the
land
he
knew
not
which
from
there
he
sailed
due
south
close
in
to
the
land
as
far
as
he
could
in
five
days
at
this
point
a
large
river
extended
up
into
the
land
they
then
followed
this
river
for
they
dared
not
sail
beyond
it
because
of
their
fear
of
hostile
reception
the
land
being
all
inhabited
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
he
had
not
found
any
inhabited
land
since
leaving
his
own
home
for
the
land
to
the
right
was
not
inhabited
all
the
way
except
by
fishermen
fowlers
and
hunters
and
these
were
all
finns
to
the
left
there
was
always
open
sea
the
permians
had
cultivated
their
soil
very
well
but
they
dared
not
enter
upon
it
the
land
of
the
terfinns
was
all
waste
except
where
hunters
fishers
or
fowlers
dwelt
the
permians
told
him
many
tales
both
about
their
own
country
and
about
surrounding
countries
but
he
knew
not
how
much
was
true
for
he
did
not
behold
it
for
himself
the
finns
and
permians
it
appeared
to
him
spoke
almost
the
same
language
he
went
hither
on
this
voyage
not
only
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
the
country
but
mainly
for
walruses
for
they
have
exceedingly
good
bone
in
their
teeth
they
brought
some
of
the
teeth
to
the
king
and
their
hides
are
very
good
for
this
whale
is
much
smaller
than
other
whales
it
is
not
more
than
seven
ells
long
but
the
best
is
in
his
own
country
those
are
eight
and
forty
ells
long
and
the
largest
are
fifty
ells
long
he
said
that
he
was
one
of
a
company
of
six
who
killed
sixty
of
these
in
two
days
ohthere
was
a
very
rich
man
in
such
possessions
as
make
up
their
wealth
that
is
in
wild
beasts
at
the
time
when
he
came
to
the
king
he
still
had
six
hundred
tame
deer
that
he
had
not
sold
the
men
call
these
reindeer
six
of
these
were
which
are
very
valuable
among
the
finns
for
it
is
with
them
that
the
finns
trap
the
wild
reindeer
he
was
among
the
first
men
in
the
land
although
he
had
not
more
than
twenty
cattle
twenty
sheep
and
twenty
swine
and
the
little
that
he
plowed
he
plowed
with
horses
their
income
however
is
mainly
in
the
tribute
that
the
finns
pay
them
animals
skins
birds
feathers
whalebone
and
made
of
the
hide
of
whale
and
the
hide
of
seal
every
one
contributes
in
proportion
to
his
means
the
richest
must
pay
fifteen
marten
skins
and
five
reindeer
skins
one
bear
skin
forty
bushels
of
feathers
a
or
girdle
and
two
each
sixty
ells
long
one
made
of
the
hide
of
the
whale
and
the
other
of
the
hide
of
the
seal
he
reported
that
the
land
of
the
northmen
was
very
long
and
very
narrow
all
that
man
can
use
for
either
grazing
or
plowing
lies
near
the
sea
and
even
that
is
very
rocky
in
some
places
and
to
the
east
alongside
the
inhabited
land
lie
wild
moors
the
finns
live
in
these
waste
lands
and
the
inhabited
land
is
broadest
to
the
eastward
becoming
always
narrower
the
farther
north
one
goes
to
the
east
it
may
be
sixty
miles
broad
or
even
a
little
broader
and
in
the
middle
thirty
or
broader
and
to
the
north
where
it
was
narrowest
he
said
that
it
might
be
three
miles
broad
to
the
moor
moreover
the
moor
is
so
broad
in
some
places
that
it
would
take
a
man
two
weeks
to
cross
it
in
other
places
it
was
of
such
a
breadth
that
a
man
can
cross
it
in
six
days
then
there
is
alongside
that
land
southward
on
the
other
side
of
the
moor
sweden
as
far
as
the
land
to
the
north
and
alongside
the
land
northward
the
land
of
the
cwens
finns
the
finns
plunder
the
northmen
over
the
moor
sometimes
and
sometimes
the
northmen
plunder
them
and
there
are
very
many
fresh
lakes
out
over
the
moor
and
the
finns
bear
their
ships
over
the
land
to
these
lakes
and
then
ravage
the
northmen
they
have
very
small
and
very
light
ships
ohthere
said
that
the
place
was
called
halgoland
in
which
he
dwelt
he
said
that
no
man
lived
north
of
him
there
is
one
port
in
the
southern
part
of
the
land
which
is
called
sciringesheal
thither
he
said
that
one
might
not
sail
in
one
month
if
he
encamped
by
night
and
had
good
wind
all
day
and
all
the
while
he
should
sail
close
to
land
and
on
the
starboard
he
has
first
ireland
and
then
the
island
that
is
between
ireland
and
this
land
then
he
has
this
land
till
he
comes
to
sciringesheal
and
all
the
way
he
has
norway
on
the
larboard
to
the
south
of
sciringesheal
the
sea
comes
far
up
into
the
land
the
sea
is
so
broad
that
no
man
may
see
across
and
jutland
is
in
the
opposite
direction
and
after
that
is
zealand
the
sea
runs
many
hundred
miles
up
in
on
that
land
and
from
sciringesheal
he
said
that
he
sailed
in
five
days
to
that
port
that
is
called
haddeby
it
lies
between
the
country
of
the
wends
and
the
saxons
and
the
angles
and
belongs
to
the
danes
when
he
sailed
away
from
sciringesheal
for
three
days
he
had
denmark
on
the
larboard
and
the
wide
sea
on
his
starboard
and
then
two
days
before
he
reached
haddeby
he
had
jutland
on
his
starboard
and
also
zealand
and
many
islands
in
that
land
had
dwelt
the
english
before
they
came
hither
to
this
land
and
then
for
two
days
he
had
on
his
larboard
the
islands
which
belong
to
denmark
iceland
is
probably
meant
wulfstan
voyage
wulfstan
said
that
he
set
out
from
haddeby
and
that
he
arrived
after
seven
days
and
nights
at
truso
the
ship
being
all
the
way
under
full
sail
he
had
wendland
mecklenburg
and
pomerania
on
the
starboard
and
langland
laaland
falster
and
sconey
on
the
larboard
and
all
these
lands
belong
to
denmark
and
then
we
had
on
our
larboard
the
land
of
the
burgundians
bornholmians
and
they
have
their
own
king
beyond
the
land
of
the
burgundians
we
had
on
our
left
those
lands
that
were
first
called
blekinge
and
meore
and
oland
and
gothland
these
lands
belong
to
the
swedes
to
the
starboard
we
had
all
the
way
the
country
of
the
wends
as
far
as
the
mouth
of
the
vistula
the
vistula
is
a
very
large
river
and
it
separates
witland
from
wendland
and
witland
belongs
to
the
esthonians
the
vistula
flows
out
of
wendland
and
runs
into
the
frische
haff
the
frische
haff
is
about
fifteen
miles
broad
then
the
elbing
empties
into
the
frische
haff
flowing
from
the
east
out
of
the
lake
on
the
shore
of
which
truso
stands
and
there
they
empty
together
into
the
frische
haff
the
elbing
from
the
east
which
flows
out
of
esthonia
and
the
vistula
from
the
south
out
of
wendland
the
vistula
then
gives
its
name
to
the
elbing
and
runs
out
of
the
mere
west
and
north
into
the
sea
hence
it
is
called
the
mouth
of
the
vistula
esthonia
is
very
large
and
there
are
many
towns
there
and
in
every
town
there
is
a
king
there
is
also
very
much
honey
and
fishing
the
king
and
the
richest
men
drink
mare
milk
but
the
poor
men
and
the
slaves
drink
mead
there
is
much
strife
among
them
there
is
no
ale
brewed
by
the
esthonians
there
is
however
plenty
of
mead
and
there
is
a
custom
among
the
esthonians
that
when
a
man
dies
he
lies
unburied
in
his
house
with
his
kindred
and
friends
for
a
month
sometimes
two
and
the
kings
and
most
powerful
men
still
longer
in
proportion
to
their
riches
it
is
sometimes
half
a
year
that
they
stay
unburnt
lying
above
ground
in
their
own
houses
all
the
time
that
the
body
is
within
drinking
and
continue
until
the
day
that
he
is
burned
the
same
day
on
which
they
are
to
bear
him
to
the
they
divide
his
possessions
whatever
may
be
left
after
the
drinking
and
pleasures
into
five
or
six
parts
sometimes
into
more
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
his
goods
then
they
place
the
largest
share
about
a
mile
from
the
town
then
the
second
then
the
third
until
it
is
all
laid
within
the
one
mile
and
the
smallest
portion
must
be
nearest
the
town
in
which
the
dead
man
lies
then
there
are
gathered
together
all
of
the
men
in
the
land
that
have
the
swiftest
horses
about
six
or
seven
miles
from
the
goods
then
they
all
run
toward
the
possessions
and
the
one
who
has
the
swiftest
horse
comes
to
the
first
and
largest
part
and
so
one
after
another
till
all
is
taken
up
and
the
man
who
arrives
at
the
goods
nearest
the
town
obtains
the
smallest
part
then
each
man
rides
his
way
with
the
property
and
he
may
keep
it
all
and
for
this
reason
fast
horses
are
very
dear
in
that
country
when
the
property
is
thus
all
spent
they
bear
him
out
and
burn
him
along
with
his
weapons
and
his
raiment
and
generally
they
spend
all
his
wealth
with
the
long
time
that
the
corpse
lies
within
and
with
the
goods
that
they
lay
along
the
roads
and
that
the
strangers
run
for
and
bear
off
with
them
again
it
is
a
custom
with
the
esthonians
to
burn
men
of
every
tribe
and
if
any
one
finds
a
bone
which
is
unburned
he
has
to
make
amends
for
it
and
there
is
one
tribe
among
the
esthonians
that
has
the
power
of
making
cold
and
it
is
because
they
put
this
cold
upon
them
that
the
corpses
lie
so
long
and
do
not
decay
and
if
a
man
places
two
vessels
full
of
ale
or
water
they
cause
both
to
be
frozen
over
whether
it
is
summer
or
winter
