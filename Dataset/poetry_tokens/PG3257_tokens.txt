thy
a
dialogue
the
world
is
full
of
selfishness
and
greed
lord
i
would
lave
its
sin
yea
mortal
earth
of
thy
good
help
has
need
go
cleanse
within
mine
ear
is
hurt
by
harsh
and
evil
speech
i
would
reform
ways
there
is
but
one
convincing
way
to
teach
speak
but
words
of
praise
on
every
hand
is
wretchedness
and
grief
despondency
and
fear
lord
i
would
give
my
fellow
men
relief
be
then
all
hope
all
cheer
lord
i
look
outward
and
grow
sick
at
heart
such
need
of
change
i
see
mortal
look
do
thy
allotted
part
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
the
weed
a
weed
is
but
an
unloved
flower
go
dig
and
prune
and
guide
and
wait
until
it
learns
its
high
estate
and
glorifies
some
bower
a
weed
is
but
an
unloved
flower
all
sin
is
virtue
unevolved
release
the
angel
from
the
go
love
thy
brother
up
to
god
behold
each
problem
solved
all
sin
is
virtue
unevolved
strength
who
is
the
strong
not
he
who
puts
to
test
his
sinews
with
the
strong
and
proves
the
best
but
he
who
dwells
where
weaklings
congregate
and
never
lets
his
splendid
strength
abate
who
is
the
good
not
he
who
walks
each
day
with
moral
men
along
the
high
clean
way
but
he
who
jostles
gilded
sin
and
shame
yet
will
not
sell
his
honor
or
his
name
who
is
the
wise
not
he
who
from
the
start
with
followers
has
taken
part
but
he
who
looks
in
tempting
eyes
and
turns
away
perceiving
her
disguise
who
is
serene
not
he
who
flees
his
kind
some
mountain
fastness
or
some
cave
to
find
but
he
who
in
the
noisiest
scene
keeps
calm
only
is
serene
affirm
body
and
mind
and
spirit
all
combine
to
make
the
creature
human
and
divine
of
this
great
trinity
no
part
deny
affirm
affirm
the
great
eternal
i
affirm
the
body
beautiful
and
whole
the
of
immortal
soul
affirm
the
mind

messenger
of
the
hour
to
speed
between
thee
and
the
source
of
power
affirm
the
spirit
the
eternal
of
this
great
trinity
no
part
deny
the
chosen
they
stood
before
the
angel
at
the
gate
the
angel
asked
should
you
enter
in
one
said
earth
my
place
was
high
and
great
and
one
warned
my
from
sin
another
was
teacher
of
the
faith
i
scorned
my
life
and
lived
in
love
with
and
one
stood
silent
the
angel
said
earthly
deed
has
sent
you
here
today
i
did
but
follow
where
they
led
he
answered
sadly
had
lost
my
so
new
the
country
and
so
strange
my
flight
i
only
sought
for
guidance
and
for
have
no
passport
the
answer
came
loved
the
earth
lowly
was
my
lot
i
strove
to
keep
my
record
free
from
blame
and
make
a
heaven
about
my
humble
spot
a
narrow
life
i
see
it
now
too
late
so
angel
drive
me
from
the
heavenly
the
angel
swung
the
portal
wide
and
free
and
took
the
sorrowing
stranger
by
the
hand
you
alone
he
said
come
with
me
of
all
this
waiting
and
insistent
band
of
what
god
gave
you
built
your
paradise
behold
your
mansion
waiting
in
the
the
nameless
unnumbered
gods
may
unremembered
die
a
thousand
creeds
may
perish
and
pass
by
yet
do
i
lift
mine
eyes
to
one
on
high
unnamed
be
he
from
whom
creation
came
there
is
no
word
whereby
to
speak
his
name
but
petty
men
have
mouthed
it
into
shame
i
lift
mine
eyes
and
with
a
force
my
full
tide
goes
sweeping
on
its
course
to
that
supreme
and
all
embracing
source
then
back
through
all
those
thirsting
channels
roll
the
mighty
billows
of
the
over
soul
and
i
am
he
the
portion
and
the
whole
as
little
streams
before
the
flood
tide
flee
as
rivers
vanish
to
become
the
sea
the
i
exists
no
more
for
i
am
he
the
word
oh
a
word
is
a
gem
or
a
stone
or
a
song
or
a
flame
or
a
sword
or
a
rose
in
bloom
or
a
sweet
perfume
or
a
drop
of
gall
is
a
word
you
may
choose
your
word
like
a
connoisseur
and
polish
it
up
with
art
but
the
word
that
sways
and
stirs
and
stays
is
the
word
that
comes
from
the
heart
you
may
work
on
your
word
a
thousand
weeks
but
it
will
not
glow
like
one
that
all
unsought
leaps
forth
white
hot
when
the
fountains
of
feeling
run
you
may
hammer
away
on
the
anvil
of
thought
and
fashion
your
word
with
care
but
unless
you
are
stirred
to
the
depths
that
word
shall
die
on
the
empty
air
for
the
word
that
comes
from
the
brain
alone
alone
to
the
brain
will
speed
but
the
word
that
sways
and
stirs
and
stays
oh
that
is
the
word
men
heed
assistance
lean
on
no
mortal
love
and
serve
for
service
is
complement
but
it
was
never
intent
your
spirit
from
its
path
should
swerve
to
gain
point
of
view
as
well
might
jupiter
or
mars
go
seeking
help
from
other
stars
instead
of
sweeping
on
as
you
look
to
the
great
eternal
cause
and
not
to
any
man
for
light
look
in
and
learn
the
wrong
and
right
from
your
own
unwritten
laws
and
when
you
question
or
demur
let
love
be
your
interpreter
if
fallacies
come
knocking
at
my
door
rather
feed
and
shelter
full
a
score
than
hide
behind
the
black
portcullis
doubt
and
run
the
risk
of
barring
one
truth
out
and
if
pretention
for
a
time
deceive
and
prove
me
one
too
ready
to
believe
far
less
my
shame
than
if
by
stubborn
act
i
brand
as
lie
some
great
colossal
fact
on
my
door
the
hangs
outside
within
the
lighted
candle
let
me
guide
some
errant
follies
on
their
wandering
way
rather
than
wisdom
give
no
welcoming
ray
consciousness
god
what
a
glory
is
this
consciousness
of
life
on
life
that
comes
to
those
who
seek
nor
would
i
if
i
might
to
others
speak
the
fullness
of
that
knowledge
it
can
bless
only
the
eager
souls
that
willing
press
along
the
mountain
passes
to
the
peak
not
to
the
dull
the
doubting
or
the
weak
will
truth
explain
or
mystery
confess
not
to
the
curious
or
impatient
soul
that
in
the
start
demands
the
end
be
shown
and
at
each
step
stops
waiting
for
a
sign
but
to
the
tireless
toiler
toward
the
goal
shall
the
great
miracles
of
god
be
known
and
life
revealed
immortal
and
divine
the
structure
upon
the
wreckage
of
thy
yesterday
design
the
structure
of
tomorrow
lay
strong
corner
stones
of
purpose
and
prepare
great
blocks
of
wisdom
cut
from
past
despair
shape
mighty
pillars
of
resolve
to
set
deep
in
the
mortar
of
regret
work
on
with
patience
though
thy
toil
be
slow
yet
day
by
day
the
edifice
shall
grow
believe
in
thine
own
self
believe
all
that
thou
hast
desired
thou
shalt
achieve
our
souls
our
souls
should
be
vessels
receiving
the
waters
of
love
for
relieving
the
sorrows
of
men
for
here
lies
the
pleasure
of
living
in
taking
bounties
and
giving
the
gifts
back
again
the
law
when
the
great
universe
was
wrought
to
might
and
majesty
from
naught
the
all
creative
force
that
force
is
thine
though
desolate
the
way
may
seem
command
thy
fate
send
forth
thy
knowledge
would
you
believe
in
presences
in
life
beyond
this
earthly
life
be
still
be
stiller
yet
and
listen
set
the
screen
of
silence
at
the
portal
of
your
will
relax
and
let
the
world
go
by
unheard
and
seal
your
lips
with
some
word
breathe
in
any
means
the
same
love
absolute
think
feel
absorb
the
thought
shut
out
all
else
until
a
subtle
flame
a
spark
from
creative
center
caught
shall
permeate
your
being
and
shall
glow
increasing
in
its
splendor
till
you
know
not
in
a
moment
or
an
hour
or
day
the
knowledge
comes
the
power
is
far
too
great
to
win
in
any
desultory
way
no
soul
is
worthy
till
it
learns
to
wait
day
after
day
be
patient
then
oh
soul
month
after
lo
the
goal
the
goal
give
give
and
thou
shalt
receive
give
thoughts
of
cheer
of
courage
and
success
to
friend
and
stranger
and
from
a
thousand
sources
far
and
near
strength
will
be
sent
thee
in
thy
hour
of
danger
give
words
of
comfort
of
defense
and
hope
to
mortals
crushed
by
sorrow
and
by
error
and
though
thy
feet
through
shadowy
paths
may
grope
thou
shalt
not
walk
in
loneliness
or
terror
give
of
thy
gold
though
small
thy
portion
be
gold
rusts
and
shrivels
in
the
hand
that
keeps
it
it
grows
in
one
that
opens
wide
and
free
who
sows
his
harvest
is
the
one
who
reaps
it
give
of
thy
love
nor
wait
to
know
the
worth
of
what
thou
lovest
and
ask
no
returning
and
thy
pathway
leads
on
earth
there
thou
shalt
find
the
lamp
of
burning
perfection
the
leaf
that
ripens
only
in
the
sun
is
dull
and
shriveled
ere
its
race
is
run
the
leaf
that
makes
a
carnival
of
death
must
tremble
first
before
the
north
breath
the
life
that
neither
grief
nor
burden
knows
is
dwarfed
in
sympathy
before
its
close
the
life
that
grows
majestic
with
the
years
must
taste
the
bitter
tonic
found
in
tears
fear
fear
is
the
twin
of
sworn
foe
distrust
if
one
breaks
in
your
heart
the
other
must
fear
is
the
open
enemy
of
good
it
means
the
god
in
man
misunderstood
who
walks
with
fear
adown
road
will
meet
his
boon
companions
failure
and
defeat
but
look
the
bully
boldly
in
the
eyes
with
mien
undaunted
and
he
turns
and
flies
the
way
between
the
finite
and
the
infinite
the
missing
link
of
love
has
left
a
void
supply
the
link
and
earth
with
heaven
will
join
in
one
continued
chain
of
endless
life
hell
is
wherever
love
is
not
and
heaven
is
location
no
dogmatic
creed
no
austere
faith
based
on
ignoble
fear
can
lead
thee
into
realms
of
joy
and
peace
unless
the
humblest
creatures
on
the
earth
are
bettered
by
thy
loving
sympathy
think
not
to
find
a
paradise
beyond
there
is
no
sudden
entrance
into
heaven
slow
is
the
ascent
by
the
path
of
love
understood
i
value
more
than
i
despise
my
tendency
to
sin
because
it
helps
me
sympathize
with
all
my
tempted
kin
he
who
has
nothing
in
his
soul
that
links
him
to
the
sod
knows
not
that
joy
of
which
lifts
him
up
to
god
and
i
am
glad
my
heart
can
say
when
others
trip
and
fall
although
i
safely
passed
that
way
understand
it
his
mansion
there
was
a
thought
he
hid
from
all
eyes
and
by
his
prudent
life
and
deeds
of
worth
he
left
a
goodly
record
upon
earth
as
one
both
pure
and
wise
but
when
he
reached
a
dark
unsightly
door
beyond
the
grave
there
stood
his
secret
thought
it
was
the
mansion
he
had
built
and
brought
to
dwell
in
on
that
shore
effect
an
unkind
tale
was
whispered
in
his
ear
he
paused
to
hear
his
thoughts
were
food
that
helped
a
falsehood
thrive
and
keep
alive
years
dawned
and
died
one
day
by
tongue
his
name
was
stung
he
cried
aloud
nor
dreamed
the
lie
was
spawn
of
thoughts
long
gone
each
mental
wave
we
send
out
from
the
mind
or
base
or
kind
completes
its
circuit
then
with
added
force
seeks
its
own
source
three
things
know
this
ye
restless
denizens
of
earth
know
this
ye
seekers
after
joy
and
mirth
three
things
there
are
eternal
in
their
worth
love
that
outreaches
to
the
humblest
things
work
that
is
glad
in
what
it
does
and
brings
and
faith
that
soars
upon
unwearied
wings
divine
the
powers
that
on
this
trio
wait
supreme
their
conquest
over
time
and
fate
love
work
and
three
alone
are
great
obstacles
the
slothful
man
saith
there
is
a
lion
in
the
way
a
lion
is
in
the
there
are
no
lions
in
the
street
no
lions
in
the
way
go
seek
the
goal
thou
slothful
soul
awake
awake
i
say
thou
dost
but
dream
of
obstacles
in
great
lexicon
that
word
illstarred
no
page
has
marred
press
on
i
say
press
on
nothing
can
keep
thee
from
thine
own
but
thine
own
slothful
mind
to
one
who
knocks
each
door
unlocks
and
he
who
seeks
shall
find
prayer
lean
on
thyself
until
thy
strength
is
tried
then
ask
help
it
will
not
be
denied
use
thine
own
sight
to
see
the
way
to
go
when
darkness
falls
ask
god
the
path
to
show
think
for
thyself
and
reason
out
thy
plan
god
has
his
work
and
thou
hast
thine
oh
man
exert
thy
will
and
use
it
for
control
god
gave
thee
jurisdiction
of
thy
soul
all
thine
immortal
powers
bring
into
play
think
act
strive
reason
then
look
up
and
pray
climbing
who
climbs
the
mountain
does
not
always
climb
the
winding
road
slants
downward
many
a
time
yet
each
descent
is
higher
than
the
last
has
thy
path
fallen
that
will
soon
be
past
beyond
the
curve
the
way
leads
up
and
on
think
not
thy
goal
forever
lost
or
gone
keep
moving
forward
if
thine
aim
is
right
thou
canst
not
miss
the
shining
mountain
height
who
would
attain
to
summits
still
and
fair
must
nerve
himself
through
valleys
of
despair
is
no
death
there
are
no
by
the
book
of
ed
c
is
no
death
there
are
no
from
zone
to
zone
from
sphere
to
sphere
the
souls
of
all
who
pass
from
here
by
hosts
of
living
thoughts

led
and
dark
or
bright
those
souls
must
tread
the
paths
they
fashioned
year
on
year
for
hells

built
of
hate
or
fear
and
heavens
of
love
our
lives

shed
across
unatlassed
worlds
of
space
and
through
mighty
universe
with
thoughts
that
bless
or
thoughts
that
curse
each
journeys
to
his
rightful
place
oh
greater
truth
no
man
has
said
is
no
death
there
are
no
it
lifts
the
mourner
from
the
sod
and
bids
him
cast
away
the
reed
of
some
uncomforting
poor
creed
and
walk
with
knowledge
for
a
rod
it
bids
the
doubter
seek
the
broad
vast
fields
where
living
facts
will
feed
all
those
whose
patience
proves
their
need
of
these
immortal
truths
of
god
it
brings
before
the
eyes
of
faith
those
realms
of
radiance
tier
on
tier
where
our
beloved
appear
more
beautiful
because
of
it
speaks
to
grief
comforted
there
is
no
death
there
are
no
realization
hers
was
a
lonely
shadowed
lot
or
so
the
unperceiving
thought
who
looked
no
deeper
than
her
face
devoid
of
chiseled
lines
of
no
farther
than
her
humble
grate
and
wondered
how
she
bore
her
fate
yet
she
was
neither
lone
nor
sad
so
much
of
love
her
spirit
had
she
found
an
spring
of
happiness
in
everything
so
near
to
her
was
heart
it
seemed
a
very
living
part
of
her
own
self
and
bud
and
blade
and
heat
and
cold
and
sun
and
shade
and
dawn
and
sunset
spring
and
fall
held
raptures
for
her
one
and
all
the
four
changing
seasons
brought
to
her
own
door
what
thousands
sought
in
wandering
ways
and
did
not
diversion
and
content
of
mind
she
loved
the
tasks
that
filled
each
such
menial
duties
but
her
way
of
looking
at
them
lent
a
grace
to
things
the
world
deemed
commonplace
obscure
and
without
place
or
name
she
gloried
in
fame
poor
plain
and
humble
in
her
dress
she
thrilled
when
beauty
and
success
and
wealth
passed
by
on
pleasure
bent
they
made
earth
seem
so
opulent
yet
none
of
quicker
sympathy
when
need
or
sorrow
came
than
she
and
so
she
lived
and
so
she
died
she
woke
as
from
a
dream
how
wide
and
wonderful
the
avenue
that
stretched
to
her
astonished
view
and
up
the
green
ascending
lawn
a
palace
caught
the
rays
of
dawn
then
suddenly
the
silence
stirred
with
one
clear
keynote
of
a
bird
a
thousand
answered
till
ere
long
the
air
was
quivering
bits
of
song
she
rose
and
wandered
forth
in
awe
amazed
and
moved
by
all
she
saw
for
like
so
many
souls
who
go
away
from
earth
she
did
not
know
the
cord
was
severed
down
the
street
with
eager
arms
stretched
forth
to
greet
came
one
she
loved
and
mourned
in
youth
her
mother
followed
then
the
truth
broke
on
her
golden
wave
on
wave
of
knowledge
infinite
the
grave
the
body
and
the
earthly
sphere
were
gone
immortal
life
was
here
they
led
her
through
the
palace
halls
from
gleaming
mirrors
on
the
walls
she
saw
herself
with
radiant
mien
and
robed
in
splendor
like
a
queen
while
glory
round
about
her
shone
this
love
murmured
your
and
when
she
gazed
with
wondering
eye
and
questioned
whence
and
where
and
why
love
answered
thus
heaven
is
made
by
thoughts
on
earth
your
walls
were
laid
year
after
year
of
purest
gold
the
beauty
of
your
mind
behold
in
this
fair
palace
aye
and
more
waits
farther
on
so
vast
your
store
i
was
not
worthy
when
i
died
to
take
my
place
here
at
your
side
i
toiled
through
long
and
weary
years
from
lower
planes
to
these
high
spheres
and
through
the
love
you
sent
from
earth
i
have
attained
a
second
birth
oft
when
my
erring
soul
would
tire
i
felt
the
strength
of
your
desire
i
heard
you
breathe
my
name
in
prayer
and
courage
conquered
weak
despair
ah
earth
needs
heaven
but
heaven
indeed
of
earth
has
just
as
great
a
across
the
terrace
with
a
bound
there
sped
a
lambkin
and
a
hound
dumb
comrades
of
the
old
earth
land
and
fondled
her
caressing
hand
loved
them
into
paradise
was
answered
to
her
questioning
eyes
taught
them
love
love
has
no
end
nor
does
life
on
form
depend
if
there
be
mortal
without
love
he
wakes
to
no
new
life
above
if
love
in
humbler
things
exist
it
must
through
other
realms
persist
until
all
love
rays
merge
in
him
hark
hear
the
heavenly
cherubim
then
hushed
and
awed
with
joy
so
vast
it
knew
no
future
and
no
past
she
stood
amidst
the
radiant
throng
that
came
to
swell
welcoming
this
humble
soul
from
far
coast
the
center
of
the
heavenly
host
on
earth
they
see
her
grave
and
say
lies
there
till
the
judgment
day
nor

so
limited
their
thought
what
miracles
by
love
are
wrought
