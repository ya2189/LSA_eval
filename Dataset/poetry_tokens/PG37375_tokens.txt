this

is
respectfully
dedicated
preface
the
o
was
written
not
to
fill
up
hours
of
idleness
but
as
a
relaxation
from
the
cares
of
a
more
important
and
arduous
occupation
its
object
is
the
encouragement
of
temperate
habits
and
the
enjoyment
of
ane
ain
fireside
it
is
hoped
it
will
be
no
less
acceptable
to
the
reader
as
another
attempt
to
assist
in
preserving
the
pure
doric
of
auld
langsyne
which
is
fast
being
superseded
by
a
language
less
pithy
less
expressive

more
fashionable

can
sympathise
with
the
lines
to
the
spot
where
we
were
born
there
is
a
charm
in
the
true
buchan
dialect
to
a
child
of
the
district
which
neither
time
age
nor
distance
can
destroy
when
far
awa
it
falls
on
the
ear
like
the
breathings
of
some
holy
melody
and
calls
up
in
the
imagination
a
fleeting
panoramic
picture
of
early
days
and
homes
and
swelling
the
heart
and
dimming
the
eyes
as
they
try
to
gaze
down
the
vista
of
the
past
dotted
it
may
be
with
the
of
those
who
have
gone
to
the
land
o
the
leal
introduction
the
superstition
with
which
the
tale
is
interwoven
of
fairy
elves
by
moonlight
shadows
seen
the
silver
token
and
the
circled
green
has
for
unknown
ages
and
in
all
countries
been
an
article
of
the
popular
creed
it
is
impossible
to
trace
the
origin
of
the
belief
some
imagine
it
has
been
conveyed
to
us
by
the
tradition
of
the
lamiæ
who
took
away
young
children
to
slay
them
and
that
this
mixed
up
with
the
tales
of
fauns
and
gods
of
the
woods
originated
the
notion
of
fairies
others
that
the
belief
was
imported
into
europe
by
the
crusaders
from
the
east
as
fairies
somewhat
resemble
the
oriental
genii
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
arabs
and
persians
whose
religion
and
history
abound
with
similar
tales
have
assigned
the
genii
a
peculiar
country
again
homer
is
supposed
to
have
been
among
authors
the
originator
of
the
idea
as
in
his
third
iliad
he
compares
the
trojans
to
cranes
when
they
descend
to
fight
against
pigmies
or
fairies
pliny
aristotle
and
others
give
countenance
to
the
belief
in
a
race
of
fairies
herodotus
described
a
nation
of
dwarfs
living
on
the
head
waters
of
the
nile
strabo
thought
that
certain
men
of
ethiopia
were
the
original
dwarfs
while
pomponius
mela
placed
them
far
south
but
nobody
believed
these
stories
which
were
taken
to
be
either
poetical
licences
or
chapters
in
romance
it
is
however
strange
that
a
race
called
obongos
about
inches
high
are
mentioned
as
existing
near
the
ashango
country
by
paul
de
chaillu
the
discoverer
of
the
gorilla
in
his
late
work
from
the
country
of
the
dwarfs
whatever
conjecture
may
be
adopted
it
is
certain
our
saxon
ancestors
long
ere
they
left
their
german
forests
believed
in
the
existence
of
a
kind
of
diminutive
demons
or
middle
species
between
men
and
spirits
to
whom
they
attributed
performances
far
exceeding
human
art
although
we
are
now
a
great
literary
people
yet
in
this
description
of
legendary
lore
we
are
far
behind
the
germans
for
this
is
a
peculiar
style
of
writing
not
exactly
fitted
for
english
cultivation
but
in
which
the
germans
seem
to
possess
the
faculty
of
invention
and
contrivance
together
with
originality
of
conception
and
power
of
execution
in
such
an
eminent
degree
as
to
leave
the
legendary
writers
of
our
own
and
other
countries
at
an
immeasurable
distance
in
fact
we
may
search
the
whole
range
of
english
french
spanish
and
italian
literature
and
there
will
not
be
found
one
author
who
dips
so
deep
into
the
dark
profound
or
one
who
is
possessed
of
that
magic
wand
that
can
give
the
same
vitality
to
the
beings
of
a
shadowy
world
as
the
germans
or
one
who
can
conjure
up
before
the
mind
eye
in
such
enchanting
colours
the
magical
representations
of
beings
and
forms
of
no
mark
or
likelihood
and
with
whose
names
even
we
were
previously
totally
unacquainted
the
fairies
of
our
own
land
were
on
the
whole
a
genial
frolicsome
happy
race
occasionally
given
to
mischievous
tricks
benefiting
those
who
were
kindly
disposed
to
them
and
paid
them
due
honour
but
revengeful
and
doing
harm
to
those
who
were
differently
inclined
they
were
a
kind
of
intermediate
beings
partaking
of
the
nature
of
both
men
and
spirits
they
had
material
bodies
and
the
power
of
making
them
invisible
and
of
passing
through
any
opening
they
were
generally
in
their
natural
state
small
in
stature
of
fair
complexion
hence
their
name
in
england
while
for
their
kind
dispositions
in
scotland
they
were
called
the
good
people
says
dr
rogers
in
his
work
scotland
social
and
domestic
in
which
will
be
found
much
of
interest
regarding
folk
lore
the
forms
of
the
scottish
fairies
were
beautiful
the
female
was
a
being
of
seraphic
loveliness
ringlets
of
yellow
hair
descended
upon
her
shoulders
and
were
bound
upon
her
brow
with
gems
of
gold
she
wore
a
mantle
of
green
silk
inlaid
with
and
zoned
round
her
waist
with
garlands
of
wild
flowers
the
male
fairy
was
clad
in
green
and
a
flowing
tunic
his
feet
were
protected
with
sandals
of
silver
from
his
left
arm
hung
a
golden
bow
and
a
quiver
of
was
suspended
on
his
left
side
his
arrows
were
tipped
in
flame
the
fairies
feasted
luxuriously
the
richest
viands
adorned
their
boards
they
frequented
human
banquets
and
conveyed
a
portion
of
the
richest
dishes
into
their
palaces
they
were
present
at
funerals
and
extracted
the
liquor
and
meats
which
were
presented
to
the
company
some
highlanders
refused
to
eat
or
drink
at
funeral
assemblages
in
apprehension
of
elfin
interference
their
habits
were
joyous
they
constructed
harps
and
pipes
which
emitted
delicious
sounds
they
held
musical
processions
and
conducted
concerts
in
remote
glens
and
on
unfrequented
heaths
in
their
processions
they
rode
on
horses
fleeter
than
the
wind
their
coursers
were
decked
with
gorgeous
trappings
from
their
manes
were
suspended
silver
bells
which
rang
with
the
zephyr
and
produced
music
of
enchanting
harmony
the
feet
of
their
steeds
fell
so
gently
that
they
dashed
not
the
dew
from
the
nor
bent
the
stalk
of
the
wild
rose
their
haunts
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
were
groves
mountains
wooded
dells
by
springs
the
southern
sides
of
hills
and
verdant
meadows
where
their
diversions
were
dancing
in
circles
hand
in
hand
the
traces
left
by
their
tiny
feet
were
supposed
to
remain
visible
on
the
grass
and
were
called
fairy
rings
but
are
now
discovered
to
be
the
production
of
an
agaric
or
mushroom
science
alas
sadly
interferes
with
these
fanciful
old
legends
but
not
always
without
leaving
some
doubtful
explanation
of
her
own
the
unfortunate
wight
who
turned
up
a
fairy
ring
with
the
ploughshare
became
the
victim
of
a
wasting
sickness
he
wha
tills
the
fairy
green
nae

he
wha

the

and

till
his

the
kingdom
of
fairyland
was
supposed
to
be
peculiarly
beautiful
somewhere
in
the
interior
of
the
earth
the
ettrick
description
of
this
fair
land
is
perhaps
unequalled
in
scottish
poetry
it
occurs
in
his
ballad
of
bonny
kilmeny
embodying
the
tradition
of
the
removal
to
fairyland
of
the
daughter
of
a
labourer
at
traquair
and
her
restoration
to
earth
a
few
weeks
after
kilmeny
had
been
where
the
cock
never
crew
where
the
rain
never
fell
and
the
wind
never
blew
but
it
seemed
as
the
harp
of
the
sky
had
rung
and
the
airs
of
heaven
played
round
her
tongue
when
she
spake
of
the
lovely
forms
she
had
seen
and
a
land
where
sin
had
never
been
a
land
of
love
and
a
land
of
light
withouten
sun
or
moon
or
night
where
the
river
swa
a
living
stream
and
the
light
a
pure
celestial
beam
the
land
of
vision
it
would
seem
a
still
an
everlasting
dream
they
lifted
kilmeny
they
led
her
away
and
she
walked
in
the
light
of
a
sunless
day
the
sky
was
a
dome
of
crystal
bright
the
fountain
of
vision
and
fountain
of
light
the
emerald
fields
were
of
dazzling
glow
and
the
flowers
of
everlasting
blow
then
deep
in
the
stream
her
body
they
laid
that
her
youth
and
beauty
never
might
fade
and
they
smiled
on
heaven
when
they
saw
her
lie
in
the
stream
of
life
that
wandered
bye
she
saw
a
sun
on
a
summer
sky
and
clouds
of
amber
sailing
bye
a
lovely
land
beneath
her
lay
and
that
land
had
glens
and
mountains
gray
and
that
land
had
valleys
and
hoary
piles
and
marled
seas
and
a
thousand
isles
its
fields
were
speckled
its
forests
green
and
its
lakes
were
all
of
the
dazzling
sheen
like
magic
mirrors
where
slumbering
lay
the
sun
and
the
sky
and
the
cloudlet
gray
which
heaved
and
trembled
and
gently
swung
on
every
shore
they
seemed
to
be
hung

she
brought
him
again
to
the
eildon
tree
underneath
the
greenwood
spray
in
huntly
banks
was
fayr
to
be
where
birds
do
sing
both
night
and
day
having
thus
restored
the
rhymer
to
earth
he
was
permitted
to
remain
for
a
time
to
enlighten
and
astonish
his
countrymen
by
deeds
resulting
from
the
knowledge
and
by
his
marvellous
prophetic
powers
acquired
during
his
seven
years
residence
in
the
fairyland
still
however
bound
to
return
to
his
royal
mistress
when
she
should
intimate
her
pleasure
accordingly
while
thomas
was
making
merry
with
his
friends
in
the
tower
of
ercildoune
a
person
came
running
in
and
told
with
marks
of
fear
and
astonishment
that
a
hart
and
hind
had
left
the
neighbouring
forest
and
were
composedly
and
slowly
parading
the
street
of
the
village
this
being
the
signal
agreed
upon
for
his
recall
to
elfinland
the
prophet
instantly
arose
left
his
habitation
and
followed
the
wonderful
animals
to
the
forest
whence
he
was
never
seen
to
return
according
to
the
popular
belief
he
still
drees
his
weird
in
fairyland
and
is
one
day
expected
to
revisit
the
earth
the
village
of
ercildoune
is
situated
on
the
leader
two
miles
above
its
junction
with
the
tweed
and
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
tower
are
still
pointed
out
as
the
rhymer
castle
the
eildon
tree
from
under
which
he
delivered
his
prophecies
no
longer
exists
but
the
spot
is
marked
by
a
large
stone
called
eildon
tree
stone
and
a
neighbouring
rivulet
takes
the
name
of
the
bogle
burn
from
being
the
spot
where
the
rhymer
visitants
met
him
hunting
was
a
favourite
sport
at
the
fairy
court
they
rode
to
the
hunt
in
three
bands
the
first
was
mounted
on
brown
horses
the
second
rode
on
grey
while
the
third
consisting
of
the
king
queen
and
chief
nobles
sat
on
white
steeds
one
member
of
the
court
rode
on
a
black
charger
this
was
kilmaulie
prime
councillor
of
fairyland
altogether
they
seem
to
have
led
a
jolly
life
there
the
principal
drawback
being
the
liability
to
pay
every
seventh
year
one
of
their
number
as
a
tribute
or
kain
to
hell
this
is
described
in
the
ballad
of
tamlane
who
while
he
relates
the
delights
of
his
home
in
fairyland
and
even
somewhat
selfishly
values
them
higher
than
the
affection
of
his
true
love
fair
janet
does
not
relish
the
possible
finale
in
his
being
made
the
kain
to
hell
but
we
that
live
in
fairyland
no
sickness
know
nor
pain
i
quit
my
body
when
i
will
and
take
to
it
again
i
quit
my
body
when
i
please
or
unto
it
repair
we
can
inhabit
at
our
ease
in
either
earth
or
air
our
shapes
and
size
we
can
convert
to
either
large
or
small
an
old
the
same
to
us
as
is
the
lofty
hall
we
sleep
in
soft
and
sweet
we
revel
in
the
stream
we
wanton
lightly
on
the
wind
or
glide
on
a
sunbeam
and
all
our
wants
are
well
supplied
from
every
rich
man
store
who
thankless
sins
the
gifts
he
gets
and
vainly
grasps
for
more
and
it
is
sic
a
bonnie
place
and
i
like
it
sae
well
that
i
wou
never
tire
janet
in
elfish
land
to
dwell
but
aye
at
ilka
seven
years
they
pay
the
teind
to
hell
and
i
sae
fat
and
fair
of
flesh
i
fear
be
mysel
and
so
the
brave
janet
actuated
by
that
greatest
of
all
feelings
a
true
woman
love
took
her
lover
from
the
procession
on
by
pulling
him
down
from
the
steed
on
which
he
rode
and
holding
him
fast
in
spite
of
all
the
horrible
and
awfu
changes
he
underwent
in
her
hands
discovering
when
he
returns
to
his
true
likeness
that
he
is
her
old
boyish
love
son
of
randolph
earl
of
murray
whom
the
fairies
had
years
before
stolen
away
there
were
as
in
all
communities
a

the

to

to

moors
or
turned
up
in
the
fields
but
which
science
ruthlessly
asserts
to
be
the
of
our
prehistoric
ancestors
they
entertained
a
particular
dislike
against
those
who
wore
clothing
of
a
green
colour
to
this
cause
the
highlanders
ascribed
the
death
of
viscount
dundee
at
killiecrankie
but
their
most
wicked
prank
of
all
was
the
carrying
away
of
handsome
unbaptized
children
from
the
side
of
the
mother
substituting
their
own
loathsome
and
sickly
progeny
in
their
stead
to
prevent
this
misfortune
it
was
customary
in
the
highlands
to
perform
the
dessil
that
is
carrying
fire
in
the
right
hand
and
in
the
direction
from
right
to
left
morning
and
evening
round
the
house
in
which
lay
the
mother
and
child
until
the
baptism
and
churching
had
taken
place
this
was
says
martin
in
his
history
of
the
west
highlands
considered
an
effectual
means
to
preserve
both
the
mother
and
infant
from
the
power
of
evil
spirits
who
are
ready
at
such
times
to
do
mischief
and
sometimes
carry
away
the
infants
and
return
poor
meagre
skeletons
and
these
infants
have
voracious
appetites
in
this
case
it
was
usual
for
those
who
believed
that
their
children
were
thus
taken
away
to
dig
a
grave
in
the
fields
on
and
there
to
lay
the
fairy
skeleton
till
next
morning
at
which
time
the
parents
went
to
the
place
where
they
doubted
not
to
find
their
own
child
instead
of
the
skeleton
they
had
also
in
other
localities
recourse
to
the
barbarous
charm
of
burning
with
a
live
coal
the
toes
of
the
suffering
infant
the
supposed
changeling
they
were
not
content
with
abstracting
handsome
children
beautiful
maidens
and
wives
sometimes
disappeared
and
of
course
the
fairies
were
the
abductors
the
miller
of
menstrie
in
fife
who
possessed
a
charming
spouse
had
given
offence
to
the
unseelie
court
and
was
in
consequence
deprived
of
his
fair
helpmate
his
distress
was
aggravated
by
hearing
his
wife
singing
in
the
air
oh
alva
woods
are
bonnie
tillicoultry
hills
are
fair
but
when
i
think
o
the
bonnie
braes
o
menstrie
it
mak
my
heart
aye
sair
after
many
attempts
to
procure
her
restoration
the
miller
chanced
one
day
in
riddling
some
stuff
at
the
mill
door
to
use
a
posture
of
enchantment
when
the
spell
was
dissolved
and
the
matron
fell
into
his
arms
the
wife
of
the
blacksmith
of
tullibody
was
carried
up
the
chimney
the
fairies
as
they
bore
her
off
singing

the

o

those
snatched
to
fairyland
might
be
recovered
within
a
year
and
a
day
but
the
spell
for
the
recovery
was
only
potent
when
the
fairies
made
on
their
annual
procession
sir
walter
scott
relates
the
following
the
wife
of
a
lothian
farmer
had
been
snatched
by
the
fairies
during
the
year
of
probation
she
had
repeatedly
appeared
on
sundays
in
the
midst
of
her
children
combing
their
hair
on
one
of
these
occasions
she
was
accosted
by
her
husband
when
she
instructed
him
how
to
rescue
her
at
the
next
procession
the
farmer
conned
his
lesson
carefully
and
on
the
appointed
day
proceeded
to
a
plot
of
furze
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
procession
it
came
but
the
ringing
of
the
fairy
bridles
so
confused
him
that
the
train
passed
ere
he
could
sufficiently
recover
himself
to
use
the
intended
spell
the
unearthly
laughter
of
the
abductors
and
the
passionate
lamentations
of
his
wife
informed
him
she
was
lost
to
him
for
ever
a
woman
who
had
been
conveyed
to
fairyland
was
warned
by
one
she
had
formerly
known
as
a
mortal
to
avoid
eating
or
drinking
with
her
new
friends
for
a
certain
period
she
obeyed
and
when
the
time
expired
she
found
herself
on
earth
restored
to
the
society
of
mankind
a
matron
was
carried
to
fairyland
to
nurse
her
child
which
had
previously
been
abducted
she
had
not
been
long
in
her
enchanted
dwelling
when
she
furtively
anointed
an
eye
with
the
contents
of
a
boiling
cauldron
she
now
discovered
that
what
had
previously
seemed
a
gorgeous
palace
was
in
reality
a
gloomy
cavern
she
was
dismissed
but
one
of
the
wicked
wights
when
she
demanded
her
child
spat
in
her
eye
and
extinguished
its
light
for
ever
about
the
middle
of
last
century
a
clergyman
at
kirkmichael
perthshire
whose
faith
was
more
regulated
by
the
scepticism
of
philosophy
than
the
credulity
of
superstition
would
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
yield
his
assent
to
the
opinion
of
the
times
at
length
however
he
felt
from
experience
that
he
doubted
what
he
ought
to
have
believed
one
night
as
he
was
returning
home
at
a
late
hour
from
a
meeting
of
presbytery
and
the
customary
dinner
which
followed
he
was
seized
by
the
fairies
and
carried
aloft
into
the
air
through
fields
of
ether
and
fleecy
clouds
he
journeyed
many
a
mile
descrying
like
sancho
panza
on
his
clavileno
the
earth
far
distant
below
him
and
no
bigger
than
a
being
thus
sufficiently
convinced
of
the
reality
of
their
existence
they
let
him
down
at
the
door
of
his
own
house
where
he
afterwards
often
recited
to
the
wondering
circle
the
marvellous
tale
of
his
adventure
some
people
believe
that
spirits
of
a
different
sort
had
a
little
to
do
with
the
worthy
minister
conviction
and
that
his
ain
gude
grey
mare
had
more
to
do
with
bringing
him
to
his
own
door
than
the
fairies
toshack
the
last
chief
of
clan
mackintosh
occupied
a
castle
or
keep
on
the
margin
of
the
river
turret
in
perthshire
he
held
nocturnal
interviews
with
a
fairy
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
from
abroad
the
mode
of
his
reaching
the
place
of
meeting
and
the
nature
of
his
companion
were
long
a
mystery
his
wife
at
length
became
jealous
of
the
frequent
departures
of
her
lord
and
being
unable
to
discover
whither
he
proceeded
resorted
to
the
scheme
of
attaching
a
piece
of
worsted
to
his
button
thus
guided
she
followed
him
down
a
subterraneous
passage
under
the
bed
of
the
river
where
after
various
windings
she
discovered
him
in
conversation
with
a
beautiful
lady
the
discovery
so
enraged
the
matron
that
she
insisted
on
the
immediate
destruction
of
the
stranger
who
fled
and
the
sun
of
toshack
set
to
rise
no
more
with
all
the
passions
and
wants
of
human
beings
fairies
are
represented
as
great
lovers
of
cleanliness
and
propriety
for
the
observance
of
which
they
were
said
frequently
to
reward
good
servants
by
dropping
money
into
their
shoes
and
on
the
other
hand
punishing
the
sluts
and
slovenly
by
pinching
them
black
and
blue
there
is
mab
the
mistress
fairy
that
doth
nightly
rob
the
dairy
and
can
help
or
hurt
the
churning
as
she
please
without
discerning
she
that
pinches
country
wenches
if
they
rub
not
clean
their
benches
and
with
sharper
nails
remembers
when
they
rake
not
up
their
embers

if
so
they
chance
to
feast

in

and
then
leads
them
from
their
boroughs
thorough
ponds
and
water
furrows
they
took
particular
fancies
to
certain
people
and
families
sometimes
their
favour
was
obtained
by
compulsion
as
in
the
case
of
musgrave
of
edenhall
near
penrith
in
cumberland
the
legend
is
that
the
butler
of
the
family
having
gone
one
night
to
draw
water
at
the
well
of
st
cuthbert
a
copious
spring
in
the
garden
of
the
mansion
of
edenhall
surprised
a
group
of
fairies
disporting
themselves
beside
the
well
at
the
margin
of
which
stood
a
drinking
glass
he
seized
hold
of
it
when
the
elves
took
to
flight
kindly
informing
him
however
as
they
went
that
if
this
glass
do
break
or
fall
farewell
the
luck
of
edenhall
it
is
still
in
existence
but
had
at
one
time
nearly
been
destroyed
by
the
wild
and
duke
of
wharton
who
let
it
drop
from
his
hands
the
luck
of
edenhall
was
however
preserved
by
the
presence
of
mind
of
the
butler
who
standing
by
caught
it
in
a
napkin
lloyd
a
boon
companion
of
the
duke
wrote
a
burlesque
poem
on
it
as
a
parody
of
chevy
chase
beginning
god
prosper
long
from
being
broke
the
luck
of
edenhall
and
uhland
the
german
poet
has
a
ballad
das
glück
von
edenhall
on
the
same
legend
the
glass
is
of
a
peculiar
shape
very
thin
and
painted
outside
with
various
devices
including
the
letters
hominum
most
probably
it
had
originally
been
a
chalice
used
in
the
chapel
dedicated
to
st
cuthbert
which
stood
in
the
neighbourhood
of
edenhall
another
description
of
fairy
was
the
brownie
so
called
from
their
complexion
a
sort
of
domestic
elf
who
was
extremely
useful
and
performed
all
sorts
of
domestic
drudgery
and
was
repaid
by
meat
a
bowl
of
milk
or
wort
but
who
if
offered
clothes
departed
in
sorrow
and
great
distress
returning
no
more
at
one
time
every
family
of
substance
had
their
brownie
milton
in
his
describes
the
brownie
and
tells
how
the
drudging
goblin
swet
to
earn
his
duly
set
when
in
one
night
ere
glimpse
of
morn
his
shadowy
flale
hath
threshed
the
corn
that
ten
could
not
end
then
lies
him
down
the
lubbar
fiend
and
stretched
out
all
the
chimney
length
basks
at
the
fire
his
hairy
strength
and
out
of
doors
he
flings
ere
the
first
cock
his
matin
rings
notwithstanding
the
progressive
increase
of
knowledge
and
proportional
decay
of
superstition
in
the
highlands
these
genii
are
still
supposed
by
many
of
the
people
to
exist
in
the
woods
and
sequestered
valleys
of
the
mountains
where
they
frequently
appear
to
the
lonely
traveller
clothed
in
green
with
dishevelled
hair
floating
over
their
shoulders
and
with
faces
more
blooming
than
the
vermeil
blush
of
a
summer
evening
at
night
in
particular
when
fancy
assimilates
to
its
own
preconceived
ideas
every
appearance
and
every
sound
the
wandering
enthusiast
is
frequently
entertained
by
their
music
more
melodious
than
he
ever
heard
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
much
this
agreeable
delusion
corresponds
with
the
superstitious
opinion
of
the
romans
concerning
the

not

country
is
the
belief
in
ghosts
than
that
in
fairies
the
legendary
records
of
fancy
transmitted
from
age
to
age
have
assigned
their
mansions
to
that
class
of
genii
in
detached
hillocks
covered
with
verdure
situated
on
the
banks
of
purling
brooks

surrounded
by
thickets

they
derive
this

from
the
practice
of
the
druids
who
were
wont
occasionally
to
retire
to
green
eminences
to
administer
justice
establish
peace
and
compose
differences
between
contending
parties
as
that
venerable
order
taught
a
or
world
beyond
the
present
their
followers
when
they
were
no
more
fondly
imagined
that
seats
where
they
exercised
a
virtue
so
beneficial
to
mankind
were
still
inhabited
by
them
in
their
disembodied

in
the
autumnal

the

from

sky
often
is
the
wayfaring
traveller
arrested
by
the
music
of
the
hills
more
melodious
than
the
strains
of
orpheus
often
struck
with
a
more
solemn
scene
he
beholds
the

engaged
in

it

be

without
very
largely
extending
our

to

other
than
a
meagre
sketch
of
this

portion
of

lore
all
our
ancient
poets
and
writers
of
fancy
scotish
and
english
dealt
largely
with
the
subject
and
quarried
from
this
exhaustless
mine
spenser
was
contented
with
the
fairies
of
romance
but
shakespeare
founded
his
elfin
world
on
the
frothiest
of
the
people
traditions
and
has
clothed
it
in
the
flowers
of
his
own
exuberant
fancy
how
much
is
the
invention
of
the
great
poet
we
shall
probably
never
be
informed
and
his
successors
have
not
rendered
the
subject
more
clear
by
adopting
the
graceful
world
he
has
created
as
though
it
had
been
interwoven
with
the
popular
mythology
and
formed
a
part
of
it
with
the
spread
of
education
and
increase
of
knowledge
the
superstitious
belief
in
fairies
has
almost
died
out
except
in
some
very
few
localities
and
among
very
uneducated
people
when
the
writer
was
a
very
young
boy
he
was
acquainted
with
an
old
couple
who
related
to
him
their
having
jointly
and
severally
seen
the
good
people
in
troops
enter
in
procession
the
castlehill
of
inverugie
and
the
husband
a
worthy
honest
man
with
the
strongest
declarations
of
verity
described
his
having
spent
part
of
a
summer
eve
lying
with
his
ear
on
the
turf
listening
to

passed

through

hall
its

upborne
by

magical
a
line
of
silver
columns
flashing
bright
and
flinging
back
the
toying
gleams
of
light
no
sun
no
moon
shone
in
the
azure
sky
yet
there
was
light
all
afar
and
nigh
flowing
from
sources
hid
far
far
beyond
like
springs
outgushing
streams
of
diamond
and
there
were
gentle
hills
and
there
above
crowning
their
tops
was
many
a
lovely
grove
waving
its
leaves
and
branches
to
and
fro
emerald
moss
that
clustering
lay
below
and
there
were
valleys
carpeted
with
flowers
there
sweet
retreats
and
honeysuckled
bowers
and
lakes
with
wavelets
playing
too
and
fro
waking
soft
music
in
their
rippling
flow
and
on
their
surface
many
a
tiny
sail
gently
impelled
by
zephyr
mildest
gale
parting
the
elfin
billows
with
a
sheen
like
opals
set
upon
an
and
crimson
corals
lined
the
peaceful
shore
disturbed
by
no
wild
surge
angry
roar
close
to
the
brink
was
many
an
elfin
home
built
of
amber
bathed
in
silver
foam
and
there
a
cataract
in
elfin
glee
danced
music
splashing
to
the
elfin
sea
now
gently
stealing
now
in
bursts
along
the
tones
came
warbling
low
or
loud
in
song
was
sweet
to
see
the
waters
leaping
so
like
bairns
at
play
that
knew
sin
or
woe
upon
a
gentle
sward
that
lay
beyond
high
on
a
solid
rock
of
diamond
was
placed
a
throne
of
yellow
burnished
gold
of
rarest
work
the
elfin
art
could
mould
its
steps
were
gemmed
with
chrysolite
and
pearl
its
canopy
with
topazes
and
beryl
and
on
it
sat
the
queen
as
spotless
fair
as
new
fallen
snow
pure
as
a
child
of
air
upon
her
brow
the
richly
jewelled
wreath
could
add
no
beauty
to
the
hair
beneath
those
queenly
tresses
were
of
raven
hue
and
sparkled
bright
with
dew
while
music
like
a
flood
broke
round
the
throne
whereon

sat
like

welcoming

placed

a

as
if

from

with

and
draped
in

it
seemed
the

in

until

went

all
to

then
lifting
up

it
glared
around
as
if
rejoicing
in
the
welcome
sound
all
suddenly
it
seemed
to
spring
to
life
as
if
to
handle
drink
betokened

to

the

the
fairy
bride
the
romance
of
the
fairy
bride
the
peris
of
eastern
romance
are
most
likely
the
source
from
which
sprang
the
tales
of
romantic
fancy
with
which
our
legendary
lore
abounds
in
the
enunciation
of
the
arabic
language
the
word
peri
would
sound
fairy
the
letter
p
not
occurring
in
its
alphabet
and
would
be
so
pronounced
by
the
crusaders
in
their
early
intercourse
with
the
arabs
in
the
wreck
of
gothic
mythology
consequent
on
the
introduction
of
christianity
the
amiable
characteristics
of
the
peris
or
fairies
became
degraded
amid
the
mischievous
attributes
ascribed
to
subordinate
spirits
more
unamiable
in
their
persons
and
practices
yet
more
congenial
to
the
habits
of
thought
of
the
northern
peoples
in
eastern
tales
however
vaguely
they
are
described
the
females
are
uniformly
represented
as
beings
of
great
beauty
amiability
and
beneficence
the
fairest
creatures
of
romantic
fancy
with
the
early
troubadours
and
minstrels
those
nymphs
formed
the
subject
of
many
a
lay
and
the
fate
of
their
amours
of
many
a
wild
romaunt
the
fondness
of
female
fays
for
human
society
were
fertile
themes
of
persian
poetry
and
early
european
romances
such
as
sir
launfal
and
sir
gruelan
wherein
the
fairies
of
normandy
and
bretagne
are
endowed
with
all
the
splendour
of
eastern
description
the
fairy
who
married
guy
de
lusignan
under
condition
that
he
should
never
intrude
on
her
privacy
was
of
this
class
she
bore
him
many
children
and
erected
for
him
a
magnificent
castle
by
her
art
they
lived
in
uninterrupted
harmony
until
the
prying
husband
concealed
himself
to
behold
his
wife
in
her
enchanted
bath
when
discovered
fled
in
great
sorrow
and
was
never
again
seen
a
humiliating
tale
which
would
seem
to
show
that
men
are
quite
as
curious
and
inquisitive
as
women
are
popularly
supposed
to
be
so
common
was
the
idea
of
the
union
of
human
beings
with
the
females
of
fairyland
in
early
times
that
it
was
firmly
believed
the
ancestor
of
the
english
monarchs
geoffrey
plantagenet
had
married
one
of
these
beings
in
the
ballad
of
thomas
of
ercildoune
the
queen
of
fairyland
is
represented
as
becoming
enamoured
of
true
thomas
among
the
icelanders
the
belief
was
common
torfaeus
in
his
history
gives
an
account
of
a
female
who
having
born
a
child
to
an
icelander
claimed
the
privilege
of
baptism
and
deposited
the
infant
at
the
gate
of
the
churchyard
for
that
purpose
with
a
golden
goblet
as
an
offering
the
belief
is
still
held
by
the
laplanders
the
origin
of
the
noble
family
of
hay
dates
from
a
remote
period
in
our
national
history
in
normandy
there
were
lands
and
a
lordship
denominated
hay
and
in
the
roll
of
the
adventurers
who
accompanied
william
the
conqueror
into
england
in
le
sieur
de
la
haya
is
expressly
mentioned
but
the
origin
of
the
erroll
family
is
thus
told
by
tradition
the
danes
having
landed
in
aberdeenshire
ravaged
the
country
as
far
as
the
town
of
perth
king
kenneth
hastened
to
give
them
battle
and
the
hostile
armies
met
on
the
leys
of
luncarty
in
perthshire
the
scots
at
first
gave
way
and
fled
through
a
narrow
pass
where
they
were
stopped
by
a
countryman
of
great
strength
and
courage
and
his
two
sons
who
had
no
other
weapons
than
the
yokes
of
their
ploughs
they
having
been
at
work
in
a
field
not
far
from
the
scene
of
action
upbraiding
the
fugitives
for
their
conduct
in
flying
from
the
field
these
peasants
succeeded
in
rallying
them
the
scots
turned
upon
their
conquerors
and
after
a
second
encounter
still
more
furious
than
the
first
they
gained
a
complete
victory
it
is
said
that
after
the
danes
were
defeated
the
old
man
lying
on
the
ground
wounded
and
fatigued
cried
hay
hay
which
word
became
the
surname
of
his
posterity
the
king
rewarded
him
with
as
much
land
in
the
carse
of
gowrie
as
a
falcon
should
fly
over
before
she
settled
and
a
falcon
being
accordingly
let
off
flew
over
an
extent
of
ground
six
miles
in
length
afterwards
called
erroll
and
lighted
on
a
stone
still
styled
the
falcon
stone
the
king
also
raised
him
to
the
dignity
of
nobility
and
assigned
to
him
and
his
family
armorial
bearings
in
accordance
with
the
signal
service
which
he
and
his
two
sons
had
rendered
to
their
country
till
lately
indeed
says
lord
lindsay
in
his
of
the
more
especially
in
great
britain
and
north
of
the
tweed
genealogy
merited
the
ridicule
which
was
so
freely
lavished
on
her
it
is
but
a
few
years
ago
since
the
most
unfounded
fictions
were
currently
believed
as
to
the
origin
of
the
scottish
families
the
stuarts
were
universally
held
to
be
the
descendants
of
banquo
the
douglases
of
dark
grey
man
who
fought
under
king
salvathius
against
the
danes
it
would
be
endless
to
enumerate
all
the
fictions
with
which
vanity
and
flattery
peopled
the
blank
of
time
they
are
now
forgotten
all
save
the
beautiful
legend
of
the
patriarch
hay
of
luncarty
on
which
milton
in
his
youth
purposed
to
found
a
drama
and
which
has
been
immortalised
by
shakespeare
in
the
play
of
circumstantial
evidence
says
pratt
is
also
so
far
in
favour
of
the
traditionary
record
as
to
render
it
hazardous
to
set
it
aside
as
wholly
unworthy
of
credit
thus
the
at
st
madoes
the
boundary
of
the
ancient
possessions
of
the
hays
of
erroll
in
perthshire
is
mentioned
by
boethius
as
existing
in
his
day
anno
and
as
having
been
set
up
immediately
after
the
defeat
of
the
danes
in
also
the
so
carefully
preserved
at
slains
castle
and
which
from
time
immemorial
has
been
venerated
by
the
family
as
that
on
which
their
ancestor
sat
down
after
the
conflict
for
the
origin
of
these
and
similar
traditions
it
would
be
difficult
to
account
had
there
been
no
foundation
whatever
for
the
narrative
of
luncarty
gilbert
de
haya
regent
of
scotland
during
the
minority
of
alexander
married
a
daughter
of
william
comyn
earl
of
buchan
about
the
old
castle
of
slains
belonged
originally
to
the
earls
of
buchan
and
became
afterwards
for
many
generations
the
seat
of
the
earls
of
erroll
there
is
some
doubt
whether
the
castle
owed
its
erection
to
fergus
who
lived
in
the
time
of
william
the
lion
or
to
the
comyns
who
succeeded
to
this
earldom
through
marriage
with
marjory
only
daughter
of
fergus
and
countess
of
buchan
in
her
own
right
again
saladin
the
famous
sultan
of
syria
fought
guy
de
lusignan
king
of
jerusalem
in
then
phillip
augustus
of
france
richard
of
england
with
many
others
and
among
them
numbers
of
our
scottish
nobility
deemed
themselves
called
upon
to
fly
to
the
rescue
of
the
holy
sepulchre
and
by
a
third
crusade
endeavour
to
wrest
its
possession
from
the
infidel
from
these
facts
considerable
doubt
arises
as
to
which
of
the
gallant
hays
was
the
hero
of
the
following
ballad
it
could
hardly
be
gilbert
who
married
the
daughter
of
the
earl
of
buchan
if
it
was
then
he
could
scarcely
have
been
in
the
third
crusade
and
there
are
grave
doubts
as
to
the
lady
claribel
having
been
the
child
of
the
elfin
queen
there
may
however
be
no
doubt
that
she
was
beautiful
as
a
princess
for
beauty
is
no
rare
qualification
of
the
ladies
of
the
district
nor
may
it
be
improbable
that
she
waylaid
and
captured
the
hay
in
one
of
the
many
knightly
journeyings
in
search
of
adventures
which
the
nobles
of
those
days
undertook
the
ladies
of
those
times
did
many
strange
things
at
least
what
would
be
considered
such
nevertheless
from
the
ballad
it
appears
she
made
a
good
wife
for
all
that
is
under
all
the
circumstances
that
as
in
many
other
legendary
tales
considerable
liberty
has
been
taken
with
fact
in
favour
of
fancy
the
fairy
bride
from
the
recitation
of
a
collector
of
ballads
of
the
olden
time
i
long
long
ago
in
the
mist
of
years
near
the
shores
of
a
sunlit
sea
hid
in
a
nook
of
a
forest
old
rippled
a
burn
in
joyous
glee
filling
with
crystal
a
basin
clear
scooped
from
a
bed
of
sparkling
sand
and
there
on
a
bank
there
lay
the
fairest
maid
of
fairyland
shading
the
water
a
birken
tree
arched
its
hoary
branches
above
and
the
sun
peep
thro
the
trembling
leaves
smiling
upon
their
silent
love
the
well
heeded
the
prying
eye
brighter
it
beamed
upon
the
tree
and
glance
for
glance
as
in
years
gone
by
back
it
shadowed
in
love
and
lee
the
maid
gazed
long
on
that
water
clear
mirroring
back
the
bending
tree
and
longed
for
one
in
whose
imaged
as
fondly
she
should
be
and
though
she
sighed
she
tremblingly
hoped
for
looking
still
on
that
mirror
fair
her
blue
eyes
flashed
with
a
brighter
glance
at
the
figure
reflected
there
as
on
the
grass
lay
the
fair
fair
may
dreaming
away
the
fleeting
hours
her
curls
seemed
rillets
of
burnished
gold
stealing
among
the
springing
flowers
for
seldom
yet
has
the
summer
sun
smiling
earth
bright
drapery
green
lit
lovelier
locks
or
form
more
fair
than
this
child
of
the
fairy
queen
oh
sad
is
the
fate
sighed
claribel
of
the
maidens
of
fairyland
who
pine
for
the
of
love
with
the
grasp
of
a
wedding
hand
oh
were
i
loved
by
some
gentle
knight
little
i
reck
of
royal
birth
station
and
rank
i
would
freely
change
for
that
holiest
joy
of
earth
no
noble
or
knight
of
elfinland
my
dreaming
fancy
shall
move
i
seem
a
maiden
of
earth
to
be
and
light
my
life
with
stars
of
love
i
win
me
a
lord
of
fame
and
worth
who
love
me
fondly
more
and
more
while
i
learn
him
lear
of
gramarye
he
teach
me
all
his
earthly
lore
the
maiden
rose
from
her
couch
of
moss
circled
around
with
a
mystic
sheen
such
beauty
i
trow
earth
never
saw
such
grace
no
living
man
hath
seen
enswathed
in
the
light
of
endless
bloom
her
brow
outpaling
falling
snow
her
cheeks
like
the
blushing
damask
rose
her
lips
with
budding
love
aglow
round
her
she
wrapped
a
cramosie
cloak
to
hide
her
robes
of
air
a
veil
of
the
moonlit
mist
she
donned
to
shade
her
face
so
passing
fair
gliding
along
through
the
forest
green
brushing
the
dew
with
hasty
feet
smiling
a
hope
on
her
parted
lips
thinking
of
him
she
longed
to
meet
ii
proudly
there
stood
by
the
shore
a
lordly
home
with
turrets
gray
but
the
knight
afar
in
paynim
land
had
been
many
a
year
away
merrily
dashed
the
foam
high
on
the
lofty
castle
wall
but
the
henchmen
moved
them
drowsily
for
lone
alas
were
bower
and
hall
was
the
hour
when
wearied
daylight
sinks
in
the
arms
of
the
waiting
west
and
gloaming
steals
from
her
purple
cave
bearing
her
lone
star
on
her
breast
when
the
glades
like
minster
windows
gleam
with
slanting
rays
of
burnished
gold
and
stealing
shadows
in
fond
embrace
are
creeping
the
forest
to
fold
through
the
dim
and
forest
aisles
flitting
among
the
grey
old
trees
the
maiden
sped
on
each
weary
sigh
mingling
with
the
evening
breeze
oh
would
he
were
come
the
gallant
hay
quickly
the
night
begins
to
fall
oh
would
that
his
manly
heart
were
mine
and
my
home
were
his
castle
hall
brighter
anon
flashed
her
bright
blue
eye
rosier
blushed
her
cheeks
i
ween
as
breathless
she
heard
a
tramp
through
the
glade
of
the
forest
green
then
quickly
came
forth
a
youthful
knight
straining
his
eyes
that
home
to
see
he
longed
for
many
a
watchful
hour
by
the
waters
of
galilee
suddenly
halted
the
courteous
knight
bright
the
glance
of
his
martial
eye
flashed
in
the
light
of
his
manhood
bloom
the
plume
of
his
morion
high
marvelled
he
much
as
the
evening
rays
fell
on
a
maid
so
wondrous
rare
art
thou
a
form
from
the
beauty
world
or
the
fairest
of
earthly
fair
list
warrior
list
the
fair
maid
said
pray
thee
list
a
lady
behest
i
wandered
far
and
lost
my
way
and
am
wearied
and
fain
would
rest
full
lowly
he
bent
his
waving
plume
till
it
mixed
with
his
horse
mane
where
is
thy
home
dear
lady
i
ask
let
me
carry
thee
thither
again
knowest
thou
brave
knight
where
the
elfin
halls
gleam
under
skies
of
purple
light
with
their
towering
domes
of
chaste
opal
glowing
in
clouds
of
crimson
bright
with
their
waving
trees
of
rarest
kind
sunlight
cheering
the
gloom
catching
the
rays
as
they
hasten
by
wreathing
their
tops
with
golden
bloom
last
eve
with
my
maids
i
left
my
home
singing
our
songs
in
gay
refrain
seeking
wild
flowers
i
wandered
alone
over
hill
over
dale
and
plain
laughingly
trod
we
the
dewy
mead
lit
by
the
rays
of
the
evening
star
but
sadly
i
spent
the
weary
day
for
ah
me
i
have
wandered
far
i
know
not
thy
home
the
young
knight
said
else
in
honour
i
bear
thee
there
tho
never
below
the
glorious
sky
have
i
seen
one
so
passing
fair
much
have
i
mingled
in
court
and
camp
in
revel
in
tourney
and
strife
but
never
till
now
have
mine
eyes
beheld
a
maid
i
could
love
as
my
wife
quickly
the
warrior
lighted
him
down
lady
he
said
my
halls
are
near
come
to
my
arms
i
carry
thee
home
and
ye
shall
be
my
peerless
fere
gramercy
my
lord
the
maiden
said
willingly
shall
i
go
with
thee
and
i
be
to
thee
a
leal
true
wife
shalt
be
the
world
to
me
around
her
form
his
arms
he
flung
to
kiss
her
lips
so
cherry
bright
but
nothing
he
held
for
the
form
ethereal
prov
as
a
stream
of
light
lady
he
said
this
is
passing
strange
there
i
see
thy
curls
of
gold
i
see
the
flash
of
thy
lustrous
eyes
but
i
can
not
thy
form
enfold
my
form
is
of
air
so
virgin
pure
by
mortal
it
can
not
be
till
by
the
cross
of
his
sword
he
swear
alone
i
shall
dwell
in
his
breast
then
he
bent
him
low
before
the
cross
and
he
vowed
by
all
he
held
dear
that
ever
he
prove
her
own
true
lord
and
she
his
much
loved
fere
come
to
my
arms
thou
beauteous
fair
and
he
grasped
her
fondly
and
fast
kissing
her
lips
grown
woman
again
fearing
his
joy
too
great
to
last
i
thine
only
thine
mine
own
dear
lord
never
again
to
roam
apart
oh
let
me
nestle
within
thine
arms
let
me
live
in
thine
inmost
heart
he
lifted
her
on
the
of
his
gallant
roan
standing
near
and
proudly
it
shook
its
stately
head
as
her
voice
fell
soft
on
its
ear
in
triumph
it
bore
them
fleetly
home
and
the
liegemen
for
years
could
tell
how
the
old
halls
rung
with
welcomes
home
to
lord
hay
and
fair
claribel
revelry
rang
in
that
castle
old
and
oft
they
pledged
him
deep
and
free
and
much
they
talked
of
his
prowess
bold
and
his
truth
and
his
braverie
but
more
they
spoke
of
his
fair
fair
bride
and
her
beauty
so
wondrous
bright
lighting
his
halls
like
the
sun
first
rays
dispersing
the
shadows
of
night
long
long
did
they
mourn
in
fairyland
for
the
princess
dear
claribel
long
was
she
missed
in
revel
and
court
in

and
bower
and

oft
when
