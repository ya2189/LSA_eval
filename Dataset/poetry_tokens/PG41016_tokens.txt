the
inestimable
value
of
literature
in
supplying
healthful
recreation
in
opening
the
mind
to
larger
views
of
life
and
in
creating
ideals
that
shall
mold
the
spiritual
nature
is
conceded
now
by
every
one
who
has
intelligently
considered
the
problems
of
education
but
the
basis
upon
which
literature
shall
be
selected
and
arranged
is
still
a
matter
of
discussion
chronology
correlation
and
ethical
training
should
all
be
recognized
incidentally
but
the
main
purpose
of
the
teacher
of
literature
is
to
send
children
on
into
life
with
a
genuine
love
for
good
reading
to
accomplish
this
three
things
should
be
true
of
the
reading
offered
first
it
should
be
second
it
should
be
literature
of
some
scope
not
merely
some
small
phase
of
literature
such
as
the
fables
or
the
poetry
of
one
of
the
less
eminent
poets
and
third
it
should
appeal
to
children
natural
interests
children
interests
varied
as
they
seem
center
in
the
marvelous
and
the
preternatural
in
the
natural
world
and
in
human
life
especially
child
life
and
the
romantic
and
heroic
aspects
of
mature
life
in
the
selections
made
for
each
grade
we
have
recognized
these
different
interests
to
grade
poetry
perfectly
for
different
ages
is
an
impossibility
much
of
the
greatest
verse
is
for
all
ages
that
is
one
reason
why
it
great
a
child
of
five
will
lisp
the
numbers
of
horatius
with
delight
and
scott
of
an
infant
with
its
romantic
color
and
its
exquisite
human
tenderness
is
dear
to
childhood
to
manhood
and
to
old
age
but
the
land
of
song
is
a
great
undiscovered
country
to
the
little
child
by
some
road
or
other
he
must
find
his
way
into
it
and
these
volumes
simply
attempt
to
point
out
a
path
through
which
he
may
be
led
into
its
happy
fields

bold
romans
a
smile
serene
and
high
he
eyed
the
flinching
tuscans
and
scorn
was
in
his
eye
quoth
he
the
litter
stands
savagely
at
bay
but
will
ye
dare
to
follow
if
astur
clears
the
way
then
whirling
up
his
broadsword
with
both
hands
to
the
height
he
rushed
against
horatius
and
smote
with
all
his
might
with
shield
and
blade
horatius
right
deftly
turned
the
blow
the
blow
though
turned
came
yet
too
nigh
it
missed
his
helm
but
gashed
his
thigh
the
tuscans
raised
a
joyful
cry
to
see
the
red
blood
flow
he
reeled
and
on
herminius
he
leaned
one
then
like
a
wild
cat
mad
with
wounds
sprang
right
at
astur
face
through
teeth
and
skull
and
helmet
so
fierce
a
thrust
he
sped
the
good
sword
stood
a
out
behind
the
tuscan
head
and
the
great
lord
of
luna
fell
at
that
deadly
stroke
as
falls
on
mount
alvernus
a
oak
far
the
crashing
forest
the
giant
arms
lie
spread
and
the
pale
augurs
muttering
low
gaze
on
the
blasted
head
on
astur
throat
horatius
right
firmly
pressed
his
heel
and
thrice
and
four
times
tugged
amain
ere
he
wrenched
out
the
steel
and
see
he
cried
the
welcome
fair
guests
that
waits
you
here
what
noble
lucumo
comes
next
to
taste
our
roman
cheer
but
at
his
haughty
challenge
a
sullen
murmur
ran
mingled
of
wrath
and
shame
and
dread
along
that
glittering
van
there
lacked
not
men
of
prowess
nor
men
of
lordly
race
for
all
etruria
noblest
were
round
the
fatal
place
but
all
etruria
noblest
felt
their
hearts
sink
to
see
on
the
earth
the
bloody
corpses
in
the
path
the
dauntless
three
and
from
the
ghastly
entrance
where
those
bold
romans
stood
all
shrank
like
boys
who
unaware
ranging
the
woods
to
start
a
hare
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
dark
lair
where
growling
low
a
fierce
old
bear
lies
amidst
bones
and
blood
was
none
who
would
be
foremost
to
lead
such
dire
attack
but
those
behind
cried
forward
and
those
before
cried
back
and
backward
now
and
forward
wavers
the
deep
array
and
on
the
tossing
sea
of
steel
to
and
fro
the
standards
reel
and
the
victorious
dies
fitfully
away
yet
one
man
for
one
moment
stood
out
before
the
crowd
well
known
was
he
to
all
the
three
and
they
gave
him
greeting
loud
now
welcome
welcome
sextus
now
welcome
to
thy
home
why
dost
thou
stay
and
turn
away
here
lies
the
road
to
rome
thrice
looked
he
at
the
city
thrice
looked
he
at
the
dead
and
thrice
came
on
in
fury
and
thrice
turned
back
in
dread
and
white
with
fear
and
hatred
scowled
at
the
narrow
way
where
wallowing
in
a
pool
of
blood
the
bravest
tuscans
lay
but
meanwhile
ax
and
lever
have
manfully
been
plied
and
now
the
bridge
hangs
tottering
above
the
boiling
tide
come
back
come
back
horatius
loud
cried
the
fathers
all
back
lartius
back
herminius
back
ere
the
ruin
fall
back
darted
spurius
lartius
herminius
darted
back
and
as
they
passed
beneath
their
feet
they
felt
the
timbers
crack
but
when
they
turned
their
faces
and
on
the
farther
shore
saw
brave
horatius
stand
alone
they
would
have
crossed
once
more
but
with
a
crash
like
thunder
fell
every
loosened
beam
and
like
a
dam
the
mighty
wreck
lay
right
athwart
the
stream
and
a
long
shout
of
triumph
rose
from
the
walls
of
rome
as
to
the
highest
was
splashed
the
yellow
foam
and
like
a
horse
unbroken
when
first
he
feels
the
rein
the
furious
river
struggled
hard
and
tossed
his
tawny
mane
and
burst
the
curb
and
bounded
rejoicing
to
be
free
and
whirling
down
in
fierce
career
battlement
and
plank
and
pier
rushed
headlong
to
the
sea
alone
stood
brave
horatius
but
constant
still
in
mind
thrice
thirty
thousand
foes
before
and
the
broad
flood
behind
down
with
him
cried
false
sextus
with
a
smile
on
his
pale
face
now
yield
thee
cried
lars
porsena
now
yield
thee
to
our
grace
round
turned
he
as
not
deigning
those
craven
ranks
to
see
naught
spake
he
to
lars
porsena
to
sextus
naught
spake
he
but
he
saw
on
palatinus
the
white
porch
of
his
home
and
he
spake
to
the
noble
river
that
rolls
by
the
towers
of
rome
oh
tiber
father
tiber
to
whom
the
romans
pray
a
roman
life
a
roman
arms
take
thou
in
charge
this
day
so
he
spake
and
speaking
sheathed
the
good
sword
by
his
side
and
with
his
harness
on
his
back
plunged
headlong
in
the
tide
no
sound
of
joy
or
sorrow
was
heard
from
either
bank
but
friends
and
foes
in
dumb
surprise
with
parted
lips
and
straining
eyes
stood
gazing
where
he
sank
and
when
above
the
surges
they
saw
his
crest
appear
all
rome
sent
forth
a
rapturous
cry
and
even
the
ranks
of
tuscany
could
scarce
forbear
to
cheer
but
fiercely
ran
the
current
swollen
high
by
months
of
rain
and
fast
his
blood
was
flowing
and
he
was
sore
in
pain
and
heavy
with
his
armor
and
spent
with
changing
blows
and
oft
they
thought
him
sinking
but
still
again
he
rose
never
i
ween
did
swimmer
in
such
an
evil
case
struggle
through
such
a
raging
flood
safe
to
the
but
his
limbs
were
borne
up
bravely
by
the
brave
heart
within
and
our
good
father
tiber
bore
bravely
up
his
chin
curse
on
him
quoth
false
sextus
will
not
the
villain
drown
but
for
this
stay
ere
close
of
day
we
should
have
sacked
the
town
heaven
help
him
quoth
lars
porsena
and
bring
him
safe
to
shore
for
such
a
gallant
feat
of
arms
was
never
seen
before
and
now
he
feels
the
bottom
now
on
dry
earth
he
stands
now
round
him
throng
the
fathers
to
press
his
gory
hands
and
now
with
shouts
and
clapping
and
noise
of
weeping
loud
he
enters
through
the
borne
by
the
joyous
crowd
they
gave
him
of
the
that
was
of
public
right
as
much
as
two
strong
oxen
could
plow
from
morn
till
night
and
they
made
a
molten
image
and
set
it
up
on
high
and
there
it
stands
unto
this
day
to
witness
if
i
lie
it
stands
in
the
comitium
plain
for
all
folk
to
see
horatius
in
his
harness
halting
upon
one
knee
and
underneath
is
written
in
letters
all
of
gold
how
valiantly
he
kept
the
bridge
in
the
brave
days
of
old
and
still
his
name
sounds
stirring
unto
the
men
of
rome
as
the
that
cries
to
them
to
charge
the
volscian
home
and
wives
still
pray
to
juno
for
boys
with
hearts
as
bold
as
his
who
kept
the
bridge
so
well
in
the
brave
days
of
old
and
in
the
nights
of
winter
when
the
cold
north
winds
blow
and
the
long
howling
of
the
wolves
is
heard
amidst
the
snow
when
round
the
lonely
cottage
roars
loud
the
tempest
din
and
the
good
logs
of
algidus
roar
louder
yet
within
when
the
oldest
cask
is
opened
and
the
largest
lamp
is
lit
when
the
chestnuts
glow
in
the
embers
and
the
kid
turns
on
the
spit
when
young
and
old
in
circle
around
the
firebrands
close
when
the
girls
are
weaving
baskets
and
the
lads
are
shaping
bows
when
the
goodman
mends
his
armor
and
trims
his
helmet
plume
when
the
goodwife
shuttle
merrily
goes
flashing
through
the
loom
with
weeping
and
with
laughter
still
is
the
story
told
how
well
horatius
kept
the
bridge
in
the
brave
days
of
old

he

unarmed
and
he
rode
all

so
faithful
in

and
so
dauntless
in

there
never
was
knight
like
the
young

he
stayed
not
for

and
he
stopped
not

he
swam
the

ere
he
alighted
at

the

quaffed
off

he
threw
down

down
to

and
she
looked
up
to
sigh
with
a

mind
me
how
with

care
from
my
sunday
coat
i
brushed
off
the
burs
and
smoothed
my
hair
and
cooled
at
the
brookside
my
brow
and
throat
since
we
parted
a
month
had
passed
to
love
a
year
down
through
the
beeches
i
looked
at
last
on
the
little
red
gate
and
the
well
sweep
near
i
can
see
it
all
now
the
slantwise
rain
of
light
through
the
leaves
the
sundown
blaze
on
her
windowpane
the
bloom
of
her
roses
under

eaves
just
the

as
a
month
before
the
house
and
the

the

the

by

nothing
changed
but
the
hives
of
bees
before
them
under
the
garden
wall
forward
and
back
went
drearily
singing
the
small
draping
each
hive
with
a
shred
of
black
trembling
i
listened
the
summer
sun
had
the
chill
of
snow
for
i
knew
she
was
telling
the
bees
of
one
gone
on
the

all

with
his

to

the
old
man
sat
and
the
still
sung
to
the
bees
stealing
out
and
in

she
was
singing
ever

the

the

flows
out
of

through

rambles
repeats

flight
of
the
ship
and
the
moon
swifter
and
swifter
the
white
ship
sped
till
she
flew
as
the
spirit
flies
from
the
dead
as
white
as
a
lily
glimmered
she
like
a
ship
fair
ghost
upon
the
sea
and
the
prince
cried
friends
is
the
hour
to
sing
is
a
song
bird
course
so
swift
on
the
wing
and
under
the
winter
stars
still
throng
from
brown
throats
white
throats
merry
and
strong
the
knights
and
the
ladies
raised
a
song
a
song
nay
a
shriek
that
rent
the
sky
that
leaped
the
deep
the
grievous
cry
of
three
hundred
living
that
now
must
die
an
instant
shriek
that
sprang
to
the
shock
as
the
ship
keel
felt
the
sunken
rock
is
said
that
afar
a
shrill
strange
sigh
the
king
ships
heard
it
and
knew
not
why
pale
stood
by
the
helm
all
those
folk
that
the
waves
must
whelm
a
great
king
heir
for
the
waves
to
whelm
and
the
helpless
pilot
pale
at
the
helm
the
ship
was
eager
and
sucked
athirst
by
the
stealthy
stab
of
the
sharp
reef
pierced
and
like
the
moil
round
a
sinking
cup
the
waters
against
her
crowded
up
a
moment
the
pilot
senses
spin
the
next
he
snatched
the
prince
the
din
cut
the
boat
loose
and
the
youth
leaped
in
a
few
friends
leaped
with
him
standing
near
row
the
sea
smooth
and
the
night
is
clear
what
none
to
be
saved
but
these
and
i
row
row
as
you
live
all
here
must
die
out
of
the
churn
of
the
choking
ship
which
the
gulf
grapples
and
the
waves
strip
they
struck
with
the
strained
oars
flash
and
dip
illustration
turner
the
shipwreck
was
then
the
splitting
bulwarks
brim
the
prince
sister
screamed
to
him
he
gazed
aloft
still
rowing
apace
and
through
the
whirled
surf
he
knew
her
face
to
the
toppling
decks
clave
one
and
all
as
a
fly
cleaves
to
a
chamber
wall
i
berold
was
clinging
anear
i
prayed
for
myself
and
quaked
with
fear
but
i
saw
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
her
he
knew
her
face
and
he
heard
her
cry
and
he
said
put
back
she
must
not
die
and
back
with
the
current
force
they
reel
like
a
leaf
that
drawn
to
a
water
wheel
the
ship
travail
they
scarce
might
float
but
he
rose
and
stood
in
the
rocking
boat
low
the
poor
ship
leaned
on
the
tide
the
naked
keel
as
she
best
might
slide
the
sister
toiled
to
the
brother
side
he
reached
an
oar
to
her
from
below
and
stiffened
his
arms
to
clutch
her
so
but
now
from
the
ship
some
spied
the
boat
and
saved
was
the
cry
from
many
a
throat
and
down
to
the
boat
they
leaped
and
fell
it
turned
as
a
bucket
turns
in
a
well
and
nothing
was
there
but
the
surge
and
swell
the
prince
that
was
and
the
king
to
come
there
in
an
instant
gone
to
his
doom
despite
of
all
england
bended
knee
and
maugre
the
norman
fealty
he
was
a
prince
of
lust
and
pride
he
showed
no
grace
till
the
hour
he
died
when
he
should
be
king
he
oft
would
vow
he
yoke
the
peasant
to
his
own
plow
him
the
ships
score
their
furrows
now
god
only
knows
where
his
soul
did
wake
but
i
saw
him
die
for
his
sister
sake
by
none
but
me
can
the
tale
be
told
the
butcher
of
rouen
poor
berold
are
swayed
by
a
king
on
a
was
a
royal
train
put
forth
to
sea
yet
the
tale
can
be
told
by
none
but
me
sea
hath
no
king
but
god
and
now
the
end
came
the
water
womb
like
the
last
great
day
that
yet
to
come
with
prayers
in
vain
and
curses
in
vain
the
white
ship
sundered
on
the
midmain
and
what
were
men
and
what
was
a
ship
were
toys
and
splinters
in
the
sea
grip
i
berold
was
down
in
the
sea
and
passing
strange
though
the
thing
may
be
of
dreams
then
known
i
remember
me
blithe
is
the
shout
on
harfleur
strand
when
morning
lights
the
sails
to
land
and
blithe
is
honfleur
echoing
gloam
when
mothers
call
the
children
home
and
high
do
the
bells
of
rouen
beat
when
the
body
of
christ
goes
down
the
street
these
things
and
the
like
were
heard
and
shown
in
a
moment
trance
the
sea
alone
and
when
i
rose
was
the
sea
did
seem
and
not
these
things
to
be
all
in
a
dream
the
ship
was
gone
and
the
crowd
was
gone
and
the
deep
shuddered
and
the
moon
shone
and
in
a
straight
grasp
my
arms
did
span
the
mainyard
rent
from
the
mast
where
it
ran
and
on
it
with
me
was
another
man
where
lands
were
none
the
dim
sea
sky
we
told
our
names
that
man
and
i
o
i
am
godefroy
de
hight
and
son
i
am
to
a
belted
knight
and
i
am
berold
the
butcher
son
who
slays
the
beasts
in
rouen
town
then
cried
we
upon
god
name
as
we
did
drift
on
the
bitter
winter
sea
but
lo
a
third
man
the
wave
and
we
said
thank
god
us
three
may
he
save
he
clutched
to
the
yard
with
panting
stare
and
we
looked
and
knew
there
he
clung
and
what
of
the
prince
quoth
he
lost
lost
we
cried
he
cried
woe
on
me
and
loosed
his
hold
and
sank
through
the
sea
and
soul
with
soul
again
in
that
space
we
two
were
together
face
to
face
and
each
knew
each
as
the
moments
sped
less
for
one
living
than
for
one
dead
and
every
still
star
overhead
seemed
an
eye
that
knew
we
were
but
dead
and
the
hours
passed
till
the
noble
son
sighed
god
be
thy
help
my
strength
foredone
o
farewell
friend
for
i
can
no
more
christ
take
thee
i
moaned
and
his
life
was
three
hundred
souls
were
all
lost
but
one
and
i
drifted
over
the
sea
alone
at
last
the
morning
rose
on
the
sea
like
an
angel
wing
that
beat
towards
me
sore
numbed
i
was
in
my
sheepskin
coat
half
dead
i
hung
and
might
nothing
note
till
i
woke
in
a
fisher
boat
the
sun
was
high
the
eastern
brim
as
i
praised
god
and
gave
thanks
to
him
that
day
i
told
my
tale
to
a
priest
who
charged
me
till
the
shrift
was
released
that
i
should
keep
it
in
mine
own
breast
and
with
the
priest
i
thence
did
fare
to
king
henry
court
at
winchester
we
spoke
with
the
king
high
chamberlain
and
he
wept
and
mourned
again
and
again
as
if
his
own
son
had
been
slain
and
round
us
ever
there
crowded
fast
great
men
with
faces
all
aghast
and
who
so
bold
that
might
tell
the
thing
which
now
they
knew
to
their
lord
the
king
much
woe
i
learnt
in
their
communing
the
king
had
watched
with
a
heart
sore
stirred
for
two
whole
days
and
this
was
the
third
and
still
to
all
his
court
would
he
say
what
keeps
my
son
so
long
away
and
they
said
the
ports
lie
far
and
wide
that
skirt
the
swell
of
the
english
tide
and
england
cliffs
are
not
more
white
than
her
women
are
and
scarce
so
light
her
skies
as
their
eyes
are
blue
and
bright
and
in
some
port
that
he
reached
from
france
the
prince
has
lingered
for
his
pleasance
but
once
the
king
asked
what
distant
cry
was
that
we
heard
the
sea
and
sky
and
one
said
with
suchlike
shouts
pardie
do
the
fishers
fling
their
nets
at
sea
and
one
who
knows
not
the
shrieking
quest
when
the
seamew
misses
its
young
from
the
nest
was
thus
till
now
they
had
soothed
his
dread
albeit
they
knew
not
what
they
said
but
who
should
speak
of
the
thing
that
all
knew
there
except
the
king
then
pondering
much
they
found
a
way
and
met
round
the
king
high
seat
that
day
and
the
king
sat
with
a
heart
sore
stirred
and
seldom
he
spoke
and
seldom
heard
was
then
through
the
hall
the
king
was
of
a
little
boy
with
golden
hair
as
bright
as
the
golden
poppy
is
that
the
beach
breeds
for
the
surf
to
kiss
yet
pale
his
cheek
as
the
thorn
in
spring
and
his
garb
black
like
the
raven
wing
nothing
was
heard
but
his
foot
through
the
hall
for
now
the
lords
were
silent
all
and
the
king
wondered
and
said
alack
who
sends
me
a
fair
boy
dressed
in
black
why
sweet
heart
do
you
pace
through
the
hall
as
though
my
court
were
a
funeral
then
lowly
knelt
the
child
at
the
dais
and
looked
up
weeping
in
the
king
face
o
wherefore
black
o
king
ye
may
say
for
white
is
the
hue
of
death
your
son
and
all
his
fellowship
lie
low
in
the
sea
with
the
white
ship
king
henry
fell
as
a
man
struck
dead
and
speechless
still
he
stared
from
his
bed
when
to
him
next
day
my
rede
i
read
there
many
an
hour
must
needs
beguile
a
king
high
heart
that
he
should
smile
full
many
a
lordly
hour
full
fain
of
his
realm
rule
and
pride
of
his
reign
but
this
king
never
smiled
again
by
none
but
me
can
the
tale
be
told

butcher
of
rouen

swayed
by

and
henry

oh
how
our
hearts
were
beating
when
at
the
dawn
of
day
we
saw
the
army
of
the
league
drawn
out
in
long
array
with
all
its
citizens
and
all
its
rebel
peers
and
appenzel
stout
infantry
and
egmont
flemish
spears
there
rose
the
brood
of
false
lorraine
the
curses
of
our
land
and
dark
mayenne
was
in
the
midst
a
truncheon
in
his
hand
and
as
we
looked
on
them
we
thought
of
seine
empurpled
flood
and
good
coligni
hoary
hair
all
dabbled
with
his
blood
and
we
cried
unto
the
living
god
who
rules
the
fate
of
war
to
fight
for
his
own
holy
name
and
henry
of
navarre
the
king
is
come
to
marshal
us
in
all
his
armor
drest
and
he
has
bound
a
plume
upon
his
gallant
crest
he
looked
upon
his
people
and
a
tear
was
in
his
eye
he
looked
upon
the
traitors
and
his
glance
was
stern
and
high
right
graciously
he
smiled
on
us
as
rolled
from
wing
to
wing
down
all
our
line
a
deafening
shout
god
save
our
lord
the
king
and
if
my
standard
bearer
fall
as
fall
full
well
he
may
for
never
saw
i
promise
yet
of
such
a
bloody
fray
press
where
ye
see
my
white
plume
shine
amidst
the
ranks
of
war
and
be
your
oriflamme
the
helmet
of
navarre
hurrah
the
foes
are
moving
hark
to
the
mingled
din
of
fife
and
steed
and
trump
and
drum
and
roaring
culverin
the
fiery
duke
is
pricking
fast
across
saint
andré
plain
with
all
the
hireling
chivalry
of
guelders
and
almayne
now
by
the
lips
of
those
ye
love
fair
gentlemen
of
france
charge
for
the
golden
lilies
upon
them
with
the
lance
a
thousand
spurs
are
striking
deep
a
thousand
spears
in
rest
a
thousand
knights
are
pressing
close
behind
the
crest
and
in
they
burst
and
on
they
rushed
while
like
a
guiding
star
amidst
the
thickest
carnage
blazed
the
helmet
of
navarre
now
god
be
praised
the
day
is
ours
mayenne
hath
turned
his
rein
hath
cried
for
quarter
the
flemish
count
is
slain
their
ranks
are
breaking
like
thin
clouds
before
a
biscay
gale
the
field
is
heaped
with
bleeding
steeds
and
flags
and
cloven
mail
and
then
we
thought
on
vengeance
and
all
along
our
van
remember
bartholomew
was
passed
from
man
to
man
but
out
spake
gentle
henry
no
frenchman
is
my
foe
down
down
with
every
foreigner
but
let
your
brethren
go
oh
was
there
ever
such
a
knight
in
friendship
or
in
war
as
our
sovereign
lord
king
henry
the
soldier
of
navarre
right
well
fought
all
the
frenchmen
who
fought
for
france
and
many
a
lordly
banner
god
gave
them
for
a
prey
but
we
of
the
religion
have
borne
us
best
in
fight
and
the
good
lord
of
rosny
has
the
cornet
white
our
own
true
maximilian
the
cornet
white
hath
the
cornet
white
with
crosses
black
the
flag
of
false
lorraine
up
with
it
high
unfurl
it
wide
that
all
the
host
may
know
how
god
hath
humbled
the
proud
house

my

i
must
speak
out

though
i
find
the
speaking
hard
praise
is
deeper
than

you
have
saved
the

his

you
must
name
your

our

ask

nothing

in

we
were
weary
and
we
fearful
and
we
in

fain
to
drop
down

still
thou
turnedst

to

at

o

stood
upon

broad
threshold
wide
the
din
of
battle
and
of
slaughter
rose
he
saw
god
stand
upon
the
weaker
side
that
sank
in
seeming
loss
before
its
foes
many
there
were
who
made
great
haste
and
sold
unto
the
cunning
enemy
their
swords
he
scorned
their
gifts
of
fame
and
power
and
gold
and
underneath
their
soft
and
flowery
words
heard
the
cold
serpent
hiss
therefore
he
went
and
humbly
joined
him
to
the
weaker
part

they

a

on
this

the

broke
into
a

with

the

rocked
with

i
said

mere
noise

give
me
your

from

they

afterward
what

oliver
wendell
holmes
dora
with
farmer
allan
at
the
farm
abode
william
and
dora
william
was
his
son
and
she
his
niece
he
often
looked
at
them
and
often
thought
i
make
them
man
and
wife
now
dora
felt
her
uncle
will
in
all
and
yearned
towards
william
but
the
youth
because
he
had
been
always
with
her
in
the
house
thought
not
of
dora
then
there
came
a
day
when
allan
called
his
son
and
said
my
son
i
married
late
but
i
would
wish
to
see
my
grandchild
on
my
knees
before
i
die
and
i
have
set
my
heart
upon
a
match
now
therefore
look
to
dora
she
is
well
to
look
to
thrifty
too
beyond
her
age
she
is
my
brother
daughter
he
and
i
had
once
hard
words
and
parted
and
he
died
in
foreign
lands
but
for
his
sake
i
bred
his
daughter
dora
take
her
for
your
wife
for
i
have
wished
this
marriage
night
and
day
for
many
years
but
william
answered
short
i
can
not
marry
dora
by
my
life
i
will
not
marry
dora
then
the
old
man
was
wroth
and
doubled
up
his
hands
and
said
you
will
not
boy
you
dare
to
answer
thus
but
in
my
time
a
father
word
was
law
and
so
it
shall
be
now
for
me
look
to
it
consider
william
take
a
month
to
think
and
let
me
have
an
answer
to
my
wish
or
by
the
lord
that
made
me
you
shall
pack
and
never
more
darken
my
doors
again
but
william
answered
madly
bit
his
lips
and
broke
away
the
more
he
looked
at
her
the
less
he
liked
her
and
his
ways
were
harsh
but
dora
bore
them
meekly
then
before
the
month
was
out
he
left
his
father
house
and
hired
himself
to
work
within
the
fields
and
half
in
love
half
spite
he
wooed
and
wed
a
laborer
daughter
mary
morrison
then
when
the
bells
were
ringing
allan
called
his
niece
and
said
my
girl
i
love
you
well
but
if
you
speak
with
him
that
was
my
son
or
change
a
word
with
her
he
calls
his
wife
my
home
is
none
of
yours
my
will
is
law
and
dora
promised
being
meek
she
thought
it
can
not
be
my
uncle
mind
will
change
and
days
went
on
and
there
was
born
a
boy
to
william
then
distresses
came
on
him
and
day
by
day
he
passed
his
father
gate
and
his
father
helped
him
not
but
dora
stored
what
little
she
could
save
and
sent
it
them
by
stealth
nor
did
they
know
who
sent
it
till
at
last
a
fever
seized
on
william
and
in
harvest
time
he
died
then
dora
went
to
mary
mary
sat
and
looked
with
tears
upon
her
boy
and
thought
hard
things
of
dora
dora
came
and
said
i
have
obeyed
my
uncle
until
now
and
i
have
sinned
for
it
was
all
thro
me
this
evil
came
on
william
at
the
first
but
mary
for
the
sake
of
him
that
gone
and
for
your
sake
the
woman
that
he
chose
and
for
this
orphan
i
am
come
to
you
you
know
there
has
not
been
for
these
five
years
so
full
a
harvest
let
me
take
the
boy
and
i
will
set
him
in
my
uncle
eye
among
the
wheat
that
when
his
heart
is
glad
of
the
full
harvest
he
may
see
the
boy
and
bless
him
for
the
sake
of
him
that
gone
and
dora
took
the
child
and
went
her
way
across
the
wheat
and
sat
upon
a
mound
that
was
unsown
where
many
poppies
grew
far
off
the
farmer
came
into
the
field
and
spied
her
not
for
none
of
all
his
men
dare
tell
him
dora
waited
with
the
child
and
dora
would
have
risen
and
gone
to
him
but
her
heart
failed
her
and
the
reapers
reaped
and
the
sun
fell
and
all
the
land
was
dark
but
when
the
morrow
came
she
rose
and
took
the
child
once
more
and
sat
upon
the
mound
and
made
a
little
wreath
of
all
the
flowers
that
grew
about
and
tied
it
round
his
hat
to
make
him
pleasing
in
her
uncle
eye
then
when
the
farmer
passed
into
the
field
he
spied
her
and
he
left
his
men
at
work
and
came
and
said
where
were
you
yesterday
whose
child
is
that
what
are
you
doing
here
so
dora
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
and
answered
softly
this
is
william
child
and
did
i
not
said
allan
did
i
not
forbid
you
dora
dora
said
again
do
with
me
as
you
will
but
take
the
child
and
bless
him
for
the
sake
of
him
that
gone
and
allan
said
i
see
it
is
a
trick
got
up
betwixt
you
and
the
woman
there
i
must
be
taught
my
duty
and
by
you
you
knew
my
word
was
law
and
yet
you
dared
to
slight
it
well
for
i
will
take
the
boy
but
go
you
hence
and
never
see
me
more
so
saying
he
took
the
boy
that
cried
aloud
and
struggled
hard
the
wreath
of
flowers
fell
at
dora
feet
she
bowed
upon
her
hands
and
the
boy
cry
came
to
her
from
the
field
more
and
more
distant
she
bowed
down
her
head
remembering
the
day
when
first
she
came
and
all
the
things
that
had
been
she
bowed
down
and
wept
in
secret
and
the
reapers
reaped
and
the
sun
fell
and
all
the
land
was
dark
then
dora
went
to
mary
house
and
stood
upon
the
threshold
mary
saw
the
boy
was
not
with
dora
she
broke
out
in
praise
to
god
that
helped
her
in
her
widowhood
and
dora
said
my
uncle
took
the
boy
but
mary
let
me
live
and
work
with
you
he
says
that
he
will
never
see
me
more
then
answered
mary
this
shall
never
be
that
thou
shouldst
take
my
trouble
on
thyself
and
now
i
think
he
shall
not
have
the
boy
for
he
will
teach
him
hardness
and
to
slight
his
mother
therefore
thou
and
i
will
go
and
i
will
have
my
boy
and
bring
him
home
and
i
will
beg
of
him
to
take
thee
back
but
if
he
will
not
take
thee
back
again
then
thou
and
i
will
live
within
one
house
and
work
for
william
child
until
he
grows
of
age
to
help
us
so
the
women
kissed
each
other
and
set
out
and
reached
the
farm
the
door
was
off
the
latch
they
peeped
and
saw
the
boy
set
up
betwixt
his
grandsire
knees
who
thrust
him
in
the
hollows
of
his
arm
and
clapt
him
on
the
hands
and
on
the
cheeks
like
one
that
loved
him
and
the
lad
stretched
out
and
babbled
for
the
golden
seal
that
hung
from
allan
watch
and
sparkled
by
the
fire
then
they
came
in
but
when
the
boy
beheld
his
mother
he
cried
out
to
come
to
her
and
allan
set
him
down
and
mary
said
o
father
if
you
let
me
call
you
so
i
never
came
a
begging
for
myself
or
william
or
this
child
but
now
i
come
for
dora
take
her
back
she
loves
you
well
o
sir
when
william
died
he
died
at
peace
with
all
men
for
i
asked
him
and
he
said
he
could
not
ever
rue
his
marrying
me
i
had
been
a
patient
wife
but
sir
he
said
that
he
was
wrong
to
cross
his
father
thus
bless
him
he
said
may
he
never
know
the
troubles
i
have
gone
thro
then
he
turned
his
face
and
passed
unhappy
that
i
am
but
now
sir
let
me
have
my
boy
for
you
will
make
him
hard
and
he
will
learn
to
slight
his
father
memory
and
take
dora
back
and
let
all
this
be
as
it
was
before
so
mary
said
and
dora
hid
her
face
by
mary
there
was
silence
in
the
room
and
all
at
once
the
old
man
burst
in
sobs
i
have
been
to
blame
to
blame
i
have
killed
my
son
i
have
killed
him
but
i
loved
him
my
dear
son
may
god
forgive
me
i
have
been
to
blame
kiss
me
my
children
then
they
clung
about
the
old
man
neck
and
kissed
him
many
times
and
all
the
man
was
broken
with
remorse
and
all
his
love
came
back
a
hundredfold
and
for
three
hours
he
sobbed
william
child
thinking
of
william
so
those
four
abode
within
one
house
together
and
as
years
went
forward
mary
took
another
mate
but
dora
lived
unmarried
till
her
death

graved
on

rests
his

upon

there
they

deep
delight

them
taught
at

it

and
the
rest
for
brutus
is
an
honorable
man
so
are
they
all
all
honorable
men
come
i
to
speak
in
cæsar
funeral
he
was
my
friend
faithful
and
just
to
me
but
brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
and
brutus
is
an
honorable
man
he
hath
brought
many
captives
home
to
rome
whose
ransoms
did
the
general
coffers
fill
did
this
in
cæsar
seem
ambitious
when
that
the
poor
have
cried
cæsar
hath
wept
ambition
should
be
made
of
sterner
stuff
yet
brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
and
brutus
is
an
honorable
man
you
all
did
see
that
on
the
lupercal
i
thrice
presented
him
a
kingly
crown
which
he
did
thrice
refuse
was
this
ambition
yet
brutus
says
he
was
ambitious
and
sure
he
is
an
honorable
man
i
speak
not
to
disprove
what
brutus
spoke
but
here
i
am
to
speak
what
i
do
know
you
all
did
love
him
once
not
without
cause
what
cause
withholds
you
then
to
mourn
for
him
o
judgment
thou
art
fled
to
brutish
beasts
and
men
have
lost
their
reason
bear
with
me
my
heart
is
in
the
coffin
there
with
cæsar
and
i
must
pause
till
it
come
back
to
me
but
yesterday
the
word
of
cæsar
might
have
stood
against
the
world
now
lies
he
there
and
none
so
poor
to
do
him
reverence
o
masters
if
i
were
disposed
to
stir
your
hearts
and
minds
to
mutiny
and
rage
i
should
do
brutus
wrong
and
cassius
wrong
who
you
all
know
are
honorable
men
i
will
not
do
them
wrong
i
rather
choose
to
wrong
the
dead
to
wrong
myself
and
you
than
i
will
wrong
such
honorable
men
but
here
a
parchment
with
the
seal
of
cæsar
i
found
it
in
his
closet
is
his
will
let
but
the
commons
hear
this
testament
which
pardon
me
i
do
not
mean
to
read
and
they
would
go
and
kiss
dead
cæsar
wounds
and
dip
their
napkins
in
his
sacred
blood
yea
beg
a
hair
of
him
for
memory
and
dying
mention
it
within
their
wills
bequeathing
it
as
a
rich
legacy
unto
their
issue
have
patience
gentle
friends
i
must
not
read
it
it
is
not
meet
you
know
how
cæsar
loved
you
you
are
not
wood
you
are
not
stones
but
men
and
being
men
hearing
the
will
of
cæsar
it
will
inflame
you
it
will
make
you
mad
tis
good
you
know
not
that
you
are
his
heirs
for
if
you
should
o
what
would
come
of
it
will
you
be
patient
will
you
stay
awhile
i
have
myself
to
tell
you
of
it
i
fear
i
wrong
the
honorable
men
whose
daggers
have
stabbed
cæsar
i
do
fear
it
you
will
compel
me
then
to
read
the
will
then
make
a
ring
about
the
corpse
of
cæsar
and
let
me
show
you
him
that
made
the
will
shall
i
descend
and
will
you
give
me
leave
nay
press
not
so
upon
me
stand
far
off
if
you
have
tears
prepare
to
shed
them
now
you
all
do
know
this
mantle
i
remember
the
first
time
ever
cæsar
put
it
on
was
on
a
summer
evening
in
his
tent
that
day
he
overcame
the
nervii
look
in
this
place
ran
cassius
dagger
through
see
what
a
rent
the
envious
casca
made
through
this
the
brutus
stabbed
and
as
he
plucked
his
cursèd
steel
away
mark
how
the
blood
of
cæsar
followed
it
as
rushing
out
of
doors
to
be
resolved
if
brutus
so
unkindly
knocked
or
no
for
brutus
as
you
know
was
cæsar
angel
judge
o
you
gods
how
dearly
cæsar
loved
him
this
was
the
most
unkindest
cut
of
all
for
when
the
noble
cæsar
saw
him
stab
ingratitude
more
strong
than
traitors
arms
quite
vanquished
him
then
burst
his
mighty
heart
and
in
his
mantle
muffling
up
his
face
even
at
the
base
of
pompey
statua
which
all
the
while
ran
blood
great
cæsar
fell
o
what
a
fall
was
there
my
countrymen
then
i
and
you
and
all
of
us
fell
down
whilst
bloody
treason
flourished
over
us
o
now
you
weep
and
i
perceive
you
feel
the
dint
of
pity
these
are
gracious
drops
kind
souls
what
weep
you
when
you
but
behold
our

stir
you
up
to
such
a
sudden

this
deed
are

what
private
griefs
they
have
alas
i
know
not
that
made
them
do
it
they
are
wise
and
honorable
and
will
no
doubt
with
reasons
answer
you
i
come
not
friends
to
steal
away
your
hearts
i
am
no
orator
as
brutus
is
but
as
you
know
me
a
plain
blunt
man
that
love
my
friend
and
that
they
know
full
well
that
gave
me
public
leave
to
speak
of
him
for
i
have
neither
wit
nor
words
nor
worth
action
nor
utterance
nor
the
power
of
speech
to
stir
men

i
only
speak
right
on
i
tell
you
that
which
you
yourselves
do
know
show
you
sweet
cæsar
wounds

three
fishers
went
sailing
out
into
the
west
out
into
the
west
as
the
sun
went
down
each
thought
on
the
woman
who
loved
him
the
best
and
the
children
stood
watching
them
out
of
the
town
for
men
must
work
and
women
must
weep
and
there
little
to
earn
and
many
to
keep
though
the
harbor
bar
be
moaning
three
wives
sat
up
in
the
lighthouse
tower
and
they
trimmed
the
lamps
as
the
sun
went
down
they
looked
at
the
squall
and
they
looked
at
the
shower
and
the
came
rolling
up
ragged
and
brown
but
men
must
work
and
women
must
weep
though
storms
be
sudden
and
waters
deep
and
the
harbor
bar
be
moaning
three
corpses
lay
out
on
the
shining
sands
in
the
morning
gleam
as
the
tide
went
down
and
the
women
are
weeping
and
wringing
their
hands
for
those
who
will
never
come
home
to
the
town
for
men
must
work
and
women
must
weep
and
the
sooner
is
over
the
sooner
to
sleep
and
to
the
bar
and
its
moaning

the
deserted
house
life
and
thought
have
gone
away
side
by
side
leaving
door
and
windows
wide
careless
tenants
they
all
within
is
dark
as
night
in
the
windows
is
no
light
and
no
murmur
at
the
door
so
frequent
on
its
hinge
before
close
the
door
the
shutters
close
or
thro
the
windows
we
shall
see
the
nakedness
and
vacancy
of
the
dark
deserted
house
come
away
no
more
of
mirth
is
here
or
sound
the
house
was
builded
of
the
earth
and
shall
fall
again
to
ground
come
away
for
life
and
thought
here
no
longer
dwell
but
in
a
city
glorious
a
great
and
distant
city
have
bought
a
mansion
incorruptible
would
they
could
have
stayed
with
us

the
last
leaf
i
saw
him
once
before
as
he
passed
by
the
door
and
again
the
pavement
stones
resound
as
he
totters
the
ground
with
his
cane
they
say
that
in
his
prime
ere
the
pruning
knife
of
time
cut
him
down
not
a
better
man
was
found
by
the
crier
on
his
round
through
the
town
but
now
he
walks
the
streets
and
he
looks
at
all
he
meets
sad
and
wan
and
he
shakes
his
feeble
head
that
it
seems
as
if
he
said
they
are
gone
the
mossy
marbles
rest
on
the
lips
that
he
has
prest
in
their
bloom
and
the
names
he
loved
to
hear
have
been
carved
for
many
a
year
on
the
tomb
my
grandmamma
has
said
poor
old
lady
she
is
dead
long
ago
that
he
had
a
roman
nose
and
his
cheek
was
like
a
rose
in
the
snow
but
now
his
nose
is
thin
and
it
rests
upon
his
chin
like
a
staff
and
a
crook
is
in
his
back
and
a
melancholy
crack
in
his
laugh
i
know
it
is
a
sin
for
me
to
sit
and
grin
at
him
here
but
the
old
three
cornered
hat
and
the
breeches
and
all
that
are
so
queer
and
if
i
should
live
to
be
the
last
leaf
upon
the
tree
in
the
spring
let
them
smile
as
i
do
now
at
the
old
forsaken
bough
where
i
cling
oliver
wendell
holmes
on
the
receipt
of
my
mother
picture
o
that
those
lips
had
language
life
has
passed
with
me
but
roughly
since
i
heard
thee
last
those
lips
are
thine
thy
own
sweet
smile
i
see
the
same
that
oft
in
childhood
solaced
me
voice
only
fails
else
how
distinct
they
say
grieve
not
my
child
chase
all
thy
fears
away
the
meek
intelligence
of
those
dear
eyes
blest
be
the
art
that
can
immortalize
the
art
that
baffles
time
tyrannic
claim
to
quench
it
here
shines
on
me
still
the
same
faithful
remembrancer
of
one
so
dear
o
welcome
guest
though
unexpected
here
who
me
honor
with
an
artless
song
affectionate
a
mother
lost
so
long
i
will
obey
not
willingly
alone
but
gladly
as
the
precept
were
her
own
and
while
that
face
renews
my
filial
grief
fancy
shall
weave
a
charm
for
my
relief
shall
steep
me
in
elysian
reverie
a
momentary
dream
that
thou
art
she
my
mother
when
i
learned
that
thou
wast
dead
say
wast
thou
conscious
of
the
tears
i
shed
hovered
thy
spirit
thy
sorrowing
son
wretch
even
then
life
journey
just
begun
perhaps
thou
me
though
unfelt
a
kiss
perhaps
a
tear
if
souls
can
weep
in
bliss
ah
that
maternal
smile
it
answers
yes
i
heard
the
bell
tolled
on
thy
burial
day
i
saw
the
hearse
that
bore
thee
slow
away
and
turning
from
my
nursery
window
drew
a
long
long
sigh
and
wept
a
last
adieu
but
was
it
such
it
where
thou
art
gone
adieus
and
farewells
are
a
sound
unknown
may
i
but
meet
thee
on
that
peaceful
shore
the
parting
word
shall
pass
my
lips
no
more
thy
maidens
grieved
themselves
at
my
concern
oft
gave
me
promise
of
thy
quick
return
what
ardently
i
wished
i
long
believed
and
disappointed
still
was
still
deceived
by
expectation
every
day
beguiled
dupe
of
even
from
a
child
thus
many
a
sad
came
and
went
till
all
my
stock
of
infant
sorrow
spent
i
learned
at
last
submission
to
my
lot
but
though
i
less
deplored
thee
forgot
where
once
we
dwelt
our
name
is
heard
no
more
children
not
thine
have
trod
my
nursery
floor
and
where
the
gardener
robin
day
by
day
drew
me
to
school
along
the
public
way
delighted
with
my
bauble
coach
and
wrapped
in
scarlet
mantle
warm
and
velvet
cap
is
now
become
a
history
little
known
that
once
we
called
the
pastoral
house
our
own
possession
but
the
record
fair
that
memory
keeps
of
all
thy
kindness
there
still
outlives
many
a
storm
that
has
effaced
a
thousand
other
themes
less
deeply
traced
thy
nightly
visits
to
my
chamber
made
that
thou
know
me
safe
and
warmly
laid
thy
morning
bounties
ere
i
left
my
home
the
biscuit
or
confectionery
plum
the
fragrant
waters
on
my
cheeks
bestowed
by
thy
own
hand
till
fresh
they
shone
and
glowed
all
this
and
more
endearing
still
than
all
thy
constant
flow
of
love
that
knew
no
fall
roughened
by
those
cataracts
and
breaks
that
humor
interposed
too
often
makes
all
this
still
legible
in
memory
page
and
still
to
be
so
to
my
latest
age
adds
joy
to
duty
makes
me
glad
to
pay
such
honors
to
thee
as
my
numbers
may
perhaps
a
frail
memorial
but
sincere
not
scorned
in
heaven
though
little
noticed
here
could
time
his
flight
reversed
restore
the
hours
when
playing
with
thy
vesture
tissued
flowers
the
violet
the
pink
and
jessamine
i
pricked
them
into
paper
with
a
pin
and
thou
wast
happier
than
myself
the
while
wouldst
softly
speak
and
stroke
my
head
and
smile
could
those
few
pleasant
days
again
appear
might
one
wish
bring
them
would
i
wish
them
here
i
would
not
trust
my
heart
the
dear
delight
seems
so
to
be
desired
perhaps
i
might
but
no
what
here
we
call
our
life
is
such
so
little
to
be
loved
and
thou
so
much
that
i
should
ill
requite
thee
to
constrain
thy
unbound
spirit
into
bonds
again
thou
as
a
gallant
bark
from
albion
coast
the
storms
all
weathered
and
the
ocean
crossed
shoots
into
port
at
some
isle
where
spices
breathe
and
brighter
seasons
smile
there
sits
quiescent
on
the
floods
that
show
her
beauteous
form
reflected
clear
below
while
airs
impregnated
with
incense
play
around
her
fanning
light
her
streamers
gay
so
thou
with
sails
how
swift
hast
reached
the
shore
where
tempests
never
beat
nor
billows
roar
and
thy
loved
consort
on
the
dangerous
tide
of
life
long
since
has
anchored
by
thy
side
but
me
scarce
hoping
to
attain
that
rest
always
from
port
withheld
always
distressed
me
howling
blasts
drive
devious
sails
ripped
seams
opening
wide
and
compass
lost
and
day
by
day
some
current
thwarting
force
sets
me
more
distant
from
a
prosperous
course
yet
o
the
thought
that
thou
art
safe
and
he
that
thought
is
joy
arrive
what
may
to
me
my
boast
is
not
that
i
deduce
my
birth
from
loins
enthroned
and
rulers
of
the
earth
but
higher
far
my
proud
pretensions
rise
the
son
of
parents
passed
into
the
skies
and
now
farewell
time
unrevoked
has
run
his
wonted
course
yet
what
i
wished
is
done
by
contemplation
help
not
sought
in
vain
i
seemed
to
have
lived
my
childhood
again
to
have
renewed
the
joys
that
once
were
mine
without
the
sin
of
violating
thine
and
while
the
wings
of
fancy
still
are
free
and
i
can
view
this
mimic
show
of
thee
time
has
but
half
succeeded
in
his
theft

removed
thy
power
to
soothe
me

my

nothing

here
the
storm

roar
without

my
heart
may
low
be
laid

god
is
round
about
me

i

follow

the

of

slant
down
the
snowy
sward
still
creeping
with
the
creeping
hours
that
lead
me
to

pure

clear

elaine

but
ten
slow
mornings
past
and
on
the
eleventh
her
father
laid
the
letter
in
her
hand
and
closed
the
hand
upon
it
and
she
died
so
that
day
there
was
dole
in

but
when
the
next
sun
brake
from
underground
then
those
two
brethren
slowly
with
bent
brows
accompanying
the
sad
past
like
a
shadow
thro
the
field
that
shone
full
summer
to
that
stream
whereon
the
barge
palled
all
its
length
in
blackest
samite
lay
there
sat
the
lifelong
creature
of
the
house
loyal
the
dumb
old
servitor
on
deck
winking
his
eyes
and
twisted
all
his
face
so
those
two
brethren
from
the
chariot
took
and
on
the
black
decks
laid
her
in
her
bed
set
in
her
hand
a
lily
her
hung
the
silken
case
with
braided
blazonings
and
kissed
her
quiet
brows
and
saying
to
her
sister
farewell
for
ever
and
again
farewell
sweet
sister
parted
all
in
tears
then
rose
the
dumb
old
servitor
and
the
dead
steered
by
the
dumb
went
upward
with
the
flood
in
her
right
hand
the
lily
in
her
left
the
letter
all
her
bright
hair
streaming
down
and
all
the
coverlid
was
cloth
of
gold
drawn
to
her
waist
and
she
herself
in
white
all
but
her
face
and
that
face
was
lovely
for
she
did
not
seem
as
dead

fast
asleep

as

noise

by

my

her

mingles
with
