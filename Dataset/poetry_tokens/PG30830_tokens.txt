a
song

foreword
the
first
rare
spring
of
song
in
my
heart
young
hours
in
my
youth
was
thus
i
sang
choosing
the
flowers
fair
the
dandelion
is
but
for
me
too
lowly
and
the
winsome
violet
is
forsooth
too
holy
the
touchmenot
go
to
what
a
face
that
speckled
like
a
common
whom
the
sun
hath
freckled
then
the
is
a
flirt
and
the
trillium
lily
in
her
spotless
gown
a
prude
sanctified
and
silly
by
her
cap
the
columbine
to
my
mind
too
merry
gossips
i
would
sooner
wed
some
plebeian
berry
and
the
shy
anemone
well
her
face
shows
sorrow
pale
goodsooth
alive
dead
and
gone
then
that
buxom
wench
big
and
blond
and
lazy
she
been
chosen
overmuch
sirs
i
mean
the
daisy
pleasant
persons
are
they
all
and
their
virtues
many
faith
i
know
but
good
of
each
and
naught
ill
of
any
but
i
choose
a
she
shall
be
my
lady
blooming
hidden
and
refined
sweet
in
places
shady
my
youth
was
thus
i
sang
in
my
heart
young
hours
in
the
first
rare
spring
of
song
choosing
the
flowers
so
i
hesitated
when
time
alone
was
reckoned
by
the
hours
that
fancy
smiled
love
and
beauty
beckoned
hard
it
was
for
me
to
choose
from
the
flowers
that
flattered
and
the
blossom
that
i
chose
soon
lay
dead
and
scattered
hard
i
found
it
then
ah
me
hard
i
found
the
choosing
harder
harder
since
i
found
ah
too
hard
the
losing
haply
had
i
chosen
then
from
the
weeds
that
tangle
wayside
woodland
and
the
wall
of
my
garden
angle
i
had
chosen
better
yea
for
these
later
hours
longer
last
the
weeds
and
oft
sweeter
are
than
weeds
by
the
wall
a
wild
iris
that
day
we
wandered
the
hills
so
lone
clouds
are
not
lonelier
the
forest
lay
in
emerald
darkness
us
many
a
stone
and
gnarly
root
made
wild
our
way
and
many
a
bird
the
glimmering
light
along
showered
the
golden
bubbles
of
its
song
then
in
the
valley
where
the
brook
went
by
silvering
the
ledges
that
it
rippled
from
an
isolated
slip
of
fallen
sky
epitomizing
heaven
in
its
sum
an
iris
bloomed
blue
as
if
the
gaze
of
spring
had
there
materialized
i
have
forgotten
many
things
since
then
much
beauty
and
much
happiness
and
grief
and
toiled
and
dreamed
among
my
rejoicing
in
the
knowledge
life
is
brief
is
winter
now
so
says
each
barren
bough
and
face
and
hair
proclaim
is
winter
now
i
would
forget
the
gladness
of
that
spring
i
would
forget
that
day
when
she
and
i
between
the
and
the
blossoming
went
hand
in
hand
beneath
the
soft
spring
sky
much
is
forgotten
yea
and
yet
and
yet
the
things
we
would
we
never
can
nor
i
how
may
then
minted
treasuries
of
crowfoot
gold
and
molded
out
of
light
the
sorrel
cups
whose
elfin
chalices
of
limpid
spar
were
streaked
with
rosy
white
nor
all
the
stars
of
twinkling
spiderwort
and
mandrake
moons
with
which
her
brows
were
girt
but
most
of
all
yea
it
were
well
for
me
me
and
my
heart
that
i
forget
that
flower
the
wild
blue
iris
azure
that
she
and
i
together
found
that
hour
its
recollection
can
but
emphasize
the
pain
of
loss
remindful
of
her
eyes
the
path
by
the
creek
there
is
a
path
that
leads
through
purple
by
and
mallow
along
a
creek
a
path
that
wildflowers
hallow
that
wild
birds
seek
roofed
thick
with
eglantine
and
grape
and
this
side
blackberries
sweet
glow
cobalt
in
the
heat
that
side
a
creamy
yellow
in
summertime
the
pawpaws
slowly
mellow
and
autumn
prime
strews
red
the
chickasaw
persimmon
brown
and
haw
the
glittering
a
wingéd
flash
goes
by
and
tawny
wasp
and
hornet
seem
gleams
that
drone
the
beetle
like
a
garnet
slips
from
the
stone
and
butterflies
float
there
spangling
with
gold
the
air
here
the
brown
thrashers
hide
the
chat
and
chide
the
blue
kingfisher
houses
above
the
stream
and
here
the
heron
drowses
lost
in
his
dream
the
vireo
flitting
note
haunts
all
the
wild
remote
and
now
a
cow
slow
bell
tinkles
along
the
dell
where
petals
winnow
from
blossomy
limbs
on
waters
where
the
minnow
swims
where
in
the
shade
slim
prisms
of
light
are
laid
when
in
the
tangled
thorn
the
hangs
a
horn
or
the
sunset
islands
guides
a
canoe
the
brown
owl
in
the
silence
calls
and
the
dew
beads
here
its
orbs
of
damp
each
one
a
firefly
lamp
then
when
the
night
is
still
here
sings
the
whippoorwill
and
stealthy
sounds
of
crickets
and
winds
that
pass
whispering
through
bramble
thickets
along
the
grass
faint
with
far
scents
of
hay
seem
feet
of
dreams
astray
and
where
the
water
shines
dark
through
vines
some
dreaming
braids
in
her
hair
a
star
reflection
seeming
a
jewel
there
while
all
the
sweet
night
long
ripples
her
quiet
song
would
i
could
imitate
o
path
thy
happy
state
making
my
life
all
beauty
all
bloom
and
beam
knowing
no
other
duty
than
just
to
dream
and
far
from
pain
and
woe
lead
feet
that
come
and
go
leading
to
calm
content
ways
the
master
went
through
lowly
things
and
humble
to
peace
and
love
teaching
the
lives
that
stumble
to
look
above
forget
the
world
of
toil
and
all
its
sad
turmoil
the
road
home
over
the
hills
as
the
pewee
flies
under
the
blue
of
the
southern
skies
over
the
hills
where
the
wings
like
a
scarlet
blossom
or
sits
and
sings
under
the
shadow
of
rock
and
tree
where
the
warm
wind
drones
with
the
and
the
tall
around
you
sway
their
flowers
of
cloudy
gray
by
the
with
its
pearly
plume
a
nod
in
the
woodland
odorous
gloom
by
the
old
in
the
elder
shade
that
the
myriad
hosts
of
the
weeds
invade
where
the
like
a
coal
of
fire
blurs
through
bush
and
brier
where
the
pennyroyal
and
mint
smell
sweet
and
blackberries
tangle
the
summer
heat
the
old
road
leads
then
crosses
the
creek
where
the
minnow
dartles
a
silvery
streak
where
the
cows
wade
deep
through
the
grass
and
the
flickering
dragonflies
gleaming
pass
that
road
is
easy
however
long
which
wends
with
beauty
as
toil
with
song
and
the
road
we
follow
shall
lead
us
straight
past
creek
and
wood
to
a
farmhouse
gate
past
hill
and
hollow
whence
scents
are
blown
of
clover
that
scythes
have
mown
to
a
house
that
stands
with
porches
wide
and
gray
low
roof
on
the
green
colonial
stately
shade
and
shine
of
the
and
the
southern
pine
with
its
orchard
acres
and
meadowlands
stretched
out
before
it
like
welcoming
hands
and
gardens
where
in
the
june
magnolias
blossom
with
many
a
moon
of
fragrance
and
in
the
feldspar
light
of
august
roses
bloom
red
and
white
in
a
woodbine
arbor
a
perfumed
place
a
slim
girl
sits
with
a
happy
face
her
bonnet
by
her
a
sunbeam
lies
on
her
lovely
hair
in
her
earnest
eyes
her
eyes
as
blue
as
the
distant
deeps
of
the
heavens
above
where
the
high
hawk
sleeps
a
book
beside
her
wherein
she
read
till
she
saw
coming
she
heard
tread
come
home
at
last
come
back
from
the
war
in
his
eyes
a
smile
on
his
brow
a
scar
to
the
south
come
back
who
wakes
from
her
dream
to
the
love
and
peace
of
a
new
regime
a
twilight
moth
dusk
is
thy
dawn
when
eve
puts
on
her
state
of
gold
and
purple
in
the
marbled
west
thou
comest
forth
like
some
embodied
trait
or
dim
conceit
a
confessed
or
of
a
rose
the
visible
wish
that
white
goes
softly
messengering
through
the
night
whom
each
expectant
flower
makes
its
guest
all
day
the
primroses
have
thought
of
thee
their
golden
heads
from
the
heat
all
day
the
mystic
moonflowers
silkenly
veiled
snowy
faces
that
no
bee
might
greet
or
butterfly
that
weighed
with
pollen
passed
keeping
sultana
charms
for
thee
at
last
their
lord
who
comest
to
salute
each
sweet
flowers
that
avoid
the
too
fervid
kisses
every
bud
that
drinks
the
tipsy
dew
and
to
the
starlight
plays
nocturnes
of
fragrance
thy
winged
shadow
links
in
bonds
of
secret
brotherhood
and
faith
o
bearer
of
their
order
shibboleth
like
some
pale
symbol
fluttering
these
pinks
what
dost
thou
whisper
in
the
balsam
ear
that
sets
it
blushing
or
the
hollyhock
a
syllabled
silence
that
no
man
may
hear
as
dreamily
upon
its
stem
it
rocks
what
spell
dost
bear
from
listening
plant
to
plant
like
some
white
witch
some
ghostly
ministrant
some
spectre
of
some
perished
flower
of
phlox
o
voyager
of
that
universe
which
lies
between
the
four
walls
of
this
garden
fair
whose
constellations
are
the
fireflies
that
wheel
their
instant
courses
everywhere
fairy
firmaments
wherein
one
sees
mimic
boötes
and
the
pleiades
thou
steerest
like
some
fairy
of
moonbeam
fluff
and
gossamer
silent
as
scent
perhaps
thou
chariotest
mab
or
king
oberon
or
haply
her
his
queen
titania
on
some
midnight
o
for
the
herb
the
magic
euphrasy
that
should
unmask
thee
to
mine
eyes
ah
me
and
all
that
world
at
which
my
soul
hath
guessed
along
the
stream
where
the
violet
shadows
brood
under
cottonwoods
and
beeches
through
whose
leaves
the
restless
reaches
of
the
river
glance
i
stood
while
the
and
the
thrush
set
to
song
the
morning
hush
there
when
woodland
hills
encroach
on
the
shadowy
winding
waters
and
the
bluets
april
daughters
at
the
darling
spring
approach
star
their
myriads
through
the
trees
all
the
land
is
one
with
peace
under
some
imposing
cliff
that
with
bush
and
tree
and
boulder
thrusts
a
gray
gigantic
shoulder
the
stream
i
oared
a
skiff
while
great
clouds
of
hue
lounged
along
the
noonday
blue
there
when
harvest
heights
impend
over
shores
of
rippling
summer
and
to
greet
the
fair
june
the
wildrose
thickets
bend
in
a
million
blossoms
dressed
all
the
land
is
one
with
rest
on
some
rock
where
gaunt
the
oak
reddens
and
the
sombre
cedar
darkens
like
a
sachem
leader
i
have
lain
and
watched
the
smoke
of
the
steamboat
far
away
trailed
athwart
the
dying
day
there
when
margin
waves
reflect
autumn
colors
gay
and
sober
and
the
october
in
berries
decked
sits
beside
the
streams
all
the
land
is
one
with
dreams
through
the
bottoms
where
by
the
wind
wild
hands
ashiver
lean
the
willows
the
river
i
have
walked
in
sleet
and
frost
while
beneath
the
cold
round
moon
frozen
gleamed
the
long
lagoon
there
when
leafless
woods
uplift
spectral
arms
the
splinter
and
the
hoary
trapper
winter
builds
his
camp
of
ice
and
drift
with
his
furred
and
shod
all
the
land
is
one
with
god
the
cricket
i
first
of
the
insect
choir
in
the
spring
we
hear
his
faint
voice
fluttering
in
the
grass
beneath
some
blossom
rosy
covering
or
frond
of
fern
upon
a
wildwood
pass
when
in
the
marsh
in
clamorous
orchestras
the
shrill
hylodes
pipe
when
in
the
blooms
or
tasseling
sassafras
sweet
threads
of
silvery
song
the
sparrow
draws
athwart
the
vibrant
atmosphere
like
some
dim
dream
in
slumber
ear
we
hear
his
cheer
cheer
cheer
ii
all
summer
through
the
mellowing
meadows
thrill
to
his
blithe
music
be
it
day
or
night
close
gossip
of
the
grass
on
field
and
hill
he
serenades
the
silence
with
delight
silence
that
hears
the
melon
slowly
split
with
ripeness
and
the
plump
peach
loosen
and
fall
and
everywhere
the
white
warm
stir
of
leafy
lights
that
flit
as
breezes
blow
above
which
loudly
clear
like
joy
who
sings
of
life
and
has
no
fear
we
hear
his
cheer
cheer
cheer
iii
then
in
the
autumn
by
the
waterside
or
along
the
walks
he
dirges
low
the
flowers
that
have
died
or
with
their
ghosts
holds
solitary
talks
lover
of
warmth
all
day
above
the
click
and
crunching
of
the
through
thick
sweet
steam
of
juice
all
night
when
white
as
chalk
the
hangs
the
rustling
rick
within
the
barn
munching
cow
and
steer
soft
as
a
memory
the
heart
holds
dear
we
hear
his
cheer
cheer
cheer
iv
kinsman
and
cousin
of
the
faëry
race
all
winter
long
he
sets
his
sober
mirth
that
brings
to
many
a
to
song
and
story
of
the
hearth
between
the
bluster
and
the
slim
high
twittering
of
the
kettle
sounds
that
hymn
when
outside
the
starless
earth
is
icicled
in
every
laden
limb
defying
frost
and
all
the
sad
and
sear
like
love
that
dies
not
and
is
always
near
we
hear
his
cheer
cheer
cheer
voices
when
blooms
and
trillium
flowers
unclasp
their
stars
to
sun
and
rain
my
heart
strikes
hands
with
winds
and
showers
and
wanders
in
the
woods
again
o
urging
impulse
born
of
spring
that
makes
glad
april
of
my
soul
no
bird
however
wild
of
wing
is
more
impatient
of
control
impetuous
of
pulse
it
beats
within
my
blood
and
bears
me
hence
above
the
housetops
and
the
streets
i
hear
its
happy
eloquence
it
tells
me
all
that
i
would
know
of
birds
and
buds
of
blooms
and
bees
i
seem
to
the
blossoms
blow
and
leaves
unfolding
on
the
trees
i
seem
to
hear
the
ring
faint
purple
peals
of
fragrance
and
the
poppies
fling
their
golden
laughter
the
land
it
calls
to
me
it
sings
to
me
i
hear
its
far
voice
night
and
day
i
can
not
choose
but
go
when
tree
and
flower
clamor
come
away
the
grasshopper
what
joy
you
take
in
making
hotness
hotter
in
emphasizing
dullness
with
your
buzz
making
monotony
more
monotonous
when
summer
comes
and
drouth
hath
dried
the
water
in
all
the
creeks
we
hear
your
ragged
rasp
filing
the
stillness
or
as
urchins
beat
a
stagnant
pond
whereon
the
bubbles
gasp
your
music
whips
the
midday
heat
o
bur
of
sound
caught
in
the
summer
hair
we
hear
you
everywhere
we
hear
you
in
the
vines
and
along
the
unkempt
lanes
among
the
weeds
amid
the
shadeless
meadows
gray
with
seeds
and
by
the
wood
which
the
rambles
sawing
the
sunlight
with
your
sultry
saw
or
like
to
tomboy
truants
at
their
play
with
noisy
mirth
among
the
barn
deep
straw
you
sing
away
the
careless
o
voice
that
clings
in
idleness
to
summer
drowsy
dress
you
tramp
of
insects
vagrant
and
unheeding
improvident
who
of
the
summer
make
one
long
green
mealtime
and
for
winter
take
no
care
aye
singing
or
just
merely
feeding
vagabond
frost
shall
pierce
ere
long
your
green
coat
or
your
brown
and
pinch
your
body
let
no
song
be
lost
but
as
you
lived
into
your
grave
go
down
like
some
small
poet
with
his
little
rhyme
forgotten
of
all
time
the
tree
toad
secluded
solitary
on
some
underbough
or
cradled
in
a
leaf
glimmering
light
like
puck
thou
crouchest
haply
watching
how
the
slow
comes
bulging
moony
white
through
loosening
loam
or
how
against
the
night
the
gathers
silver
to
endow
the
darkness
with
or
how
the
dew
conspires
to
hang
at
dusk
with
lamps
of
chilly
fires
each
blade
that
shrivels
now
ii
o
vague
confederate
of
the
whippoorwill
of
owl
and
cricket
and
the
katydid
thou
gatherest
up
the
silence
in
one
shrill
vibrating
note
and
it
where
half
hid
in
cedars
twilight
sleeps
each
azure
lid
drooping
a
line
of
golden
eyeball
afar
yet
near
i
hear
thy
dewy
voice
within
the
garden
of
the
hours
apoise
on
dusk
deep
daffodil
iii
minstrel
of
moisture
silent
when
high
noon
shows
her
tanned
face
among
the
thirsting
clover
and
parching
meadows
thy
tenebrious
tune
wakes
with
the
dew
or
when
the
rain
is
over
thou
troubadour
of
wetness
and
damp
lover
of
all
cool
things
admitted
comrade
boon
of
twilight
hush

little
intimate
of

first
fluttering
star
and
delicate
round
rim
of

moon
iv
art
trumpeter
of
dwarfland
does
thy
horn
inform
the
gnomes
and
goblins
of
the
hour
when
they
may
gambol
under
haw
and
thorn
straddling
each
winking
web
and
twinkling
flower
or
of
elfland
whose
tall
tower
the
liriodendron
is
from
whence
is
borne
the
elfin
music
of
thy
bell
deep
bass
to
summon
fairies
to
their
starlit
maze
to
summon
them
or
warn
the
when
one
by
one
the
stars
have
trembled
through
eve
shadowy
hues
of
violet
rose
and
fire
as
on
a
the
limpid
dew
orbs
its
bright
beads
and
one
by
one
the
choir
of
insects
wakes
on
nodding
bush
and
brier
then
through
the
woods
where
wandering
winds
pursue
a
ceaseless
whisper
like
an
eery
lyre
struck
in
the
halls
where
ghosts
and
dreams
hold
revelry
your
goblin
music
screams
shivering
and
strange
as
some
strange
thought
come
true
brown
as
the
agaric
that
frills
dead
trees
or
those
fantastic
fungi
of
the
woods
that
crowd
the
dampness
are
you
kin
to
these
in
some
mysterious
way
that
still
eludes
my
fancy
you
who
haunt
the
solitudes
with
wailings
voice
that
seems
to
freeze
out
of
the
darkness
like
the
scent
which
broods
rank
and
over
autumn
nooks
that
to
the
mind
might
well
suggest
such
looks
ghastly
and
gray
as
pale
clairvoyance
sees
you
people
night
with
weirdness
lone
and
drear
beneath
the
stars
you
cry
your
wizard
runes
and
in
the
haggard
silence
filled
with
fear
your
shuddering
hoot
seems
some
bleak
grief
that
croons
mockery
and
terror
or
beneath
the
glimmer
to
the
startled
ear
crazed
madman
snatches
of
old
perished
tunes
the
witless
wit
of
outcast
edgar
there
in
the
wild
night
or
wan
with
all
despair
the
mirthless
laughter
of
the
fool
in
lear
the
chipmunk
he
makes
a
roadway
of
the
crumbling
fence
or
on
the
fallen
tree
brown
as
a
leaf
fall
stripes
with
russet
gambols
down
the
dense
green
twilight
of
the
woods
we
see
not
whence
he
comes
nor
whither
is
a
time
too
brief
he
vanishes
swift
carrier
of
some
fay
some
pixy
steed
that
haunts
our
a
goblin
glimpse
from
woodland
way
to
way
what
harlequin
mood
of
nature
qualified
him
so
with
happiness
and
limbed
him
with
such
young
activity
as
winds
that
ride
the
ripples
have
that
dance
on
every
side
as
sunbeams
know
that
urge
the
sap
and
pith
through
hearts
of
trees
yet
made
him
to
delight
in
darkness
like
a
moonlight
myth
lairing
in
labyrinths
of
the
under
night
here
by
a
rock
beneath
the
moss
a
hole
leads
to
his
home
the
den
wherein
he
sleeps
lulled
by
near
noises
of
the
cautious
mole
tunnelling
its
mine
like
some
ungainly
troll
or
by
the
tireless
cricket
there
that
keeps
picking
its
drowsy
and
monotonous
lute
or
slower
sounds
of
grass
that
creeps
and
creeps
and
trees
unrolling
mighty
root
on
root
such
is
the
music
of
his
sleeping
hours
day
hath
another
is
a
melody
he
trips
to
made
by
the
assembled
flowers
and
light
and
fragrance
laughing
the
bowers
and
ripeness
busy
with
the
such
strains
perhaps
as
filled
with
mute
amaze
the
silent
music
of
earth
ecstasy
the
satyr
soul
the
faun
of
classic
days

a
day

in

with

in

mass

from

brake

the
heron
famine

searching

stale
pools

its
call

the

false
prophet
now
croaks
to
the
stagnant

overhead
still
as
if
painted
there
a
buzzard
hangs
black
on
the
burning
blue
before
the
rain

the
rain

in
the
obscure
east
weak
and
morose
the
moon
hung
sickly
gray
around
its
disc
the
storm

cracked
and
creased
wove
an
enormous
web

it
lay
like
some
white
spider
hungry
for
its
prey
vindictive
looked
the
scowling
firmament
in
which
each
star
that
flashed
a
dagger
ray
seemed
filled
with
malice
of
some
dark
intent
the
croaked
and
underneath
the
stone
the
peevish
cricket
raised
a
creaking
cry
within
the
world
these
sounds
were
heard
alone
save
when
the
ruffian
wind
swept
from
the
sky
making
each
tree
like
some
sad
spirit
sigh
or
shook
the
clumsy
beetle
from
its
weed
that
in
the
drowsy
darkness
bungling
by
sharded
the
silence
with
its
feverish
speed
slowly
the
tempest
gathered
hours
passed
before
was
heard
the
thunder
sullen
drum
rumbling
night
hollow
and
the
earth
at
last
restless
with
waiting
like
a
woman
dumb
with
doubting
of
the
love
that
should
have
clomb
her
casement
hours
ago
avowed
again
protestations
joy
that
he
had
come

all
night
long
i
heard
the
heavens
explain
the
broken
drouth
it
seemed
the
listening
forest
held
its
breath
before
some
vague
and
unapparent
form
of
fear
approaching
with
the
wings
of
death
on
the
impending
storm
above
the
hills
big
bellying
clouds
loomed
black
and
ominous
yet
silent
as
the
blue
that
pools
calm
heights
of
heaven
deepening
back
clouds
of
snowdrift
hue
then
instantly
as
when
a
multitude
shout
riot
and
war
through
some
tumultuous
town
innumerable
voices
swept
the
wood
as
wild
the
wind
rushed
down
and
fierce
and
few
as
when
a
strong
man
weeps
great
dashed
the
dust
and
overhead
ponderous
and
vast
down
the
prodigious
deeps
went
slow
the
thunder
tread
and
swift
and
furious
as
when
giants
fence
the
lightning
foils
of
tempest
went
insane
then
far
and
near
sonorous
earth
grew
dense
with
long
sweet
sweep
of
rain
feud
a
mile
of
lane
hedged
high
with
and
dying
daisies
white
with
sun
that
leads
downward
into
a
wood
through
which
a
stream
steals
like
a
shadow
over
which
is
laid
a
bridge
of
logs
worn
deep
by
many
a
team
sunk
in
the
tangled
shade
far
off
a
lifts
its
lonely
cry
and
in
the
sleepy
silver
of
the
sky
a
gray
hawk
wheels
scarce
larger
than
a
hand
from
point
to
point
the
road
grows
worse
and
worse
until
that
place
is
reached
where
all
the
land
seems
burdened
with
some
curse
a
ragged
fence
of
pickets
warped
and
sprung
on
which
the
fragments
of
a
gate
are
hung
divides
a
hill
the
fox
and
haunt
a
wilderness
of
briers
whose
tops
a
battered
barn
is
seen
and
gaunt
fields
that
know
no
crops
fields
over
which
a
path
with
burs
and
ragweeds
noisy
with
the
grasshoppers
leads
lost
irresolute
as
paths
the
cows
wear
through
the
woods
unto
a
woodshed
then
with
wrecks
of
windows
to
a
huddled
house
where
men
have
murdered
men
a
house
whose
tottering
chimney
clay
and
rock
is
seamed
and
crannied
whose
lame
door
and
lock
are
around
which
there
and
here
are
sinister
one
dreads
to
look
the
place
seems
thinking
of
that
time
of
fear
and
dares
not

emptiness
the
sunlight
falls
on

with
scents
of
clover
the
winds
brim
over
and
in
the
cover
the
stream
is
loud
bloom
that
blanches
the
orchard
branches
old
farms
and
ranches
gleam
in
the
gloam
blossoms
blowing
through
fields
for
sowing
the
cows

lowing
the
cows
come
home
where
ways
are
narrow
a
flits
like
an
arrow
of
living
rhyme
the
red
sun
poises
and
farmyard
noises
mix
with
glad
voices
of
when
dusk
disposes
of
all
its
roses
and
darkness
closes
and
work
is
done
a
moon
white
feather
in
starry
weather
and
two
together
whose
hearts
are
one
worship
i
the
mornings
raise
voices
of
gold
in
the
almighty
praise
the
sunsets
soar
in
choral
crimson
from
far
shore
to
shore
each
is
a
blast
reverberant
of
color
seen
as
vast
concussions
that
the
vocal
firmament
in
worship
sounds
every
continent
ii
not
for
our
ears
the
cosmic
music
of
the
rolling
spheres
that
sweeps
the
skies
music
we
hear
but
only
with
our
eyes
for
all
too
weak
our
mortal
frames
to
bear
the
words
these
speak
those
detonations
that
we
name
the
dawn
and
sunset
hues
earth
harmony
puts
on
unheard
all
things
are
wrought
of
melody
unheard
yet
full
of
speaking
spells
within
the
rock
within
the
tree
a
soul
of
music
dwells
a
mute
symphonic
sense
that
thrills
the
silent
frame
of
mortal
things
its
heart
beats
in
the
ancient
hills
in
every
flower
sings
to
harmony
all
growth
is
set
each
seed
is
but
a
music
mote
from
which
each
plant
each
violet
evolves
its
purple
note
compact
of
melody
the
rose
woos
the
soft
wind
with
strain
on
strain
of
crimson
and
the
lily
blows
its
white
bars
to
the
rain
the
trees
are
pæans
and
the
grass
one
long
green
fugue
beneath
the
sun
song
is
their
life

all
shall

shall
cease

reincarnation
high
in

liberty

in

a

he

justice
begins
many
centuries
in
some
vile
body
must
his
soul
atone
as
slave
as
beggar
loathsome
with
disease
less
than
the
dog
at
which
we
fling
a
stone
on
chenoweth
run
i
thought
of
the
road
through
the
glen
with
its
hawk
nest
high
in
the
pine
with
its
rock
where
the
fox
had
his
den
tangles
of
sumach
and
vine
where
she
swore
to
be
mine
i
thought
of
the
creek
and
its
banks
now
glooming
now
gleaming
with
sun
the
rustic
bridge
builded
of
planks
the
bridge
over
chenoweth
run
where
i
wooed
her
and
won
i
thought
of
the
house
in
the
lane
with
its
pinks
and
its
sweet
mignonette
its
fence
and
the
gate
with
the
chain
its
porch
where
the
roses
hung
wet
where
i
kissed
her
and
met
then
i
thought
of
the
family
graves
walled
rudely
with
stone
in
the
west
where
the
sorrowful
waves
and
the
wind
is
a
spirit
distressed
where
they
laid
her
to
rest
and
my
soul
overwhelmed
with
despair
cried
out
on
the
city
and
mart
how
i
longed
how
i
longed
to
be
there
away
from
the
struggle
and
smart
by
her
and
my
heart
by
her
and
my
heart
in
the
west
laid
sadly
together
as
one
on
her
grave
for
a
moment
to
rest
far
away
from
the
noise
and
the
sun
on
chenoweth
run
home
again
far
down
the
lane
a
window
pane
gleams
the
trees
through
night
and
rain
the
weeds
are
dense
through
which
a
fence
of
pickets
rambles
none
sees
whence
before
a
porch
all
indistinct
of
line
and
matted
with
no
thing
is
heard
no
beast
or
bird
only
the
rain
by
which
are
stirred
the
draining
leaves
and
trickling
eaves
of
crib
and
barn
one
scarce
perceives
and
where
hang
wet
the
phlox
the
candytuft
and
mignonette
the
hour
is
late
at
any
rate
she
has
not
heard
him
at
the
gate
upon
the
roof
the
rain
was
proof
against
his
horse
galloping
hoof
and
when
the
old
gate
with
its
weight
and
chain
creaked
she
imagined
was
the
wind
and
rain
along
he
steals
with
cautious
heels
and
by
the
lamplit
window
kneels
and
there
she
sits
and
rocks
and
knits
within
the
shadowy
light
that
flits
on
face
and
hair
so
sweetly
sad
and
gray
dreaming
of
him
she
thinks
is
far
away
upon
his
cheeks
is
it
the
streaks
of
rain
as
now
the
old
porch
creaks
beneath
his
stride
then
warm
and
wide
the
door
flings
and
she
at
his
side
mother
and
he
back
from
the
war
her
boy
kisses
her
face
all
streaming
wet
with
joy
a
street
of
ghosts
the
drowsy
day
with
eyes
dreams
in
this
quaint
forgotten
street
that
like
some
wreckage
lies
left
by
the
sea
receding
beat
far
from
the
city
restless
feet
abandoned
pavements
that
the
huge
roots
have
wrecked
whose
flagstones
feel
no
more
the
sweep
of
draperies
and
sunken
curbs
whereon
no
wheel
grinds
nor
the
gallant
heel
old
houses
walled
with
rotting
brick
dormered
like
withered
faces
sad
and
sick
stare
from
each
side
all
broken
paned
with
battered
doors
the
rain
has
stained
and
though
the
day
be
white
with
heat
their
ancient
yards
are
dim
and
cold
where
now
the
toad
makes
its
retreat
with
mold
and
naught
but
noisome
weeds
unfold
the
slow
gray
slug
and
snail
have
trailed
their
slimy
silver
up
and
down
the
beds
where
once
the
veiled
rich
beauty
and
the
mushroom
brown
swells
where
the
lily
tossed
its
crown
the
shadowy
scents
that
haunt
and
flit
along
the
walks
beneath
the
boughs
seem
ghosts
of
sweethearts
here
who
sit
or
wander
each
empty
house
wrapped
in
the
silence
of
dead
vows
and
haply
when
the
evening
droops
her
amber
eyelids
in
the
west
here
one
might
hear
the
swish
of
hoops
or
catch
the
glint
of
hat
or
vest
as
two
dim
lovers
past
him
pressed
and
instant
as
some
star
slant
flame
that
scores
the
swarthy
cheek
of
night
perhaps
behold
colonial
dame
and
gentleman
in
stately
white
go
glimmering
down
the
pale
moonlight
in
powder
patch
and
furbelow
and
sword
and
every
one
tory
and
whig
of
long
ago
as
real
as
in
the
days
long
done
the
courtly
days
of
washington
in
the
shadow
of
the
beeches
in
the
shadow
of
the
beeches
where
the
fragile
wildflowers
bloom
where
the
pensive
silence
pleaches
green
a
roof
of
cool
perfume
have
you
felt
an
awe
imperious
as
when
in
a
church
mysterious
windows
paint
with
god
the
gloom
in
the
shadow
of
the
beeches
where
the
waters
flow
where
the
sun
sloped
splendor
bleaches
every
wave
to
foaming
snow
have
you
felt
a
music
solemn
as
when
minster
arch
and
column
echo
low
in
the
shadow
of
the
beeches
where
the
light
and
shade
are
blent
where
the
beseeches
and
the
breeze
is
brimmed
with
scent
is
it
joy
or
melancholy
that
us
partly
wholly
to
our
spirit
betterment
in
the
shadow
of
the
beeches
lay
me
where
no
eye
perceives
where
like
some
great
arm
that
reaches
gently
as
a
love
that
grieves
one
gnarled
root
may
clasp
me
kindly
while
the
long
years
working
blindly
slowly
change
my
dust
to
leaves
requiescat
the
roses
mourn
for
her
who
sleeps
within
the
tomb
for
her
each
weeps
dew
and
perfume
in
each
neglected
each
blossom
droops
its
lovely
head
they
miss
her
touch
they
miss
her
tread
her
face
of
bloom
of
happy
bloom
the
very
breezes
grieve
for
her
a
lonely
grief
for
her
each
tree
is
sorrower
each
blade
and
leaf
the
foliage
rocks
itself
and
sighs
and
to
its
woe
the
wind
replies
they
miss
her
girlish
laugh
and
cries
whose
life
was
brief
was
very
brief
the
sunlight
too
seems
pale
with
care
or
sick
with
woe
the
memory
haunts
it
of
her
hair
its
golden
glow
no
more
within
the
the
sleepy
bloom
is
kissed
awake
the
sun
is
sad
for
her
dear
sake
whose
head
lies
low
lies
dim
and
low
the
bird
that
sang
so
sweet
is
still
at
dusk
and
dawn
no
more
it
makes
the
silence
thrill
of
wood
and
lawn
in
vain
the
buds
when
it
is
near
open
each
pink
and
perfumed
ear
the
song
it
sings
she
will
not
hear
who
now
is
gone
is
dead
and
gone
ah
well
she
sleeps
who
loved
them
well
the
birds
and
bowers
the
fair
the
young
the
lovable
who
once
was
ours
alas
that
loveliness
must
pass
must
come
to
lie
beneath
the
grass
that
youth
and
joy
must
fade
alas
and
die
like
flowers
earth
sweetest
flowers
the
quest
i
first
i
asked
the
busy
in
the
balmy
bowers
saying
sweetheart
tell
it
me
have
you
seen
her
she
is
cousin
to
the
flowers
face
and
mouth
and
the
sweetness
of
the
south
but
it
passed
me
silently
ii
then
i
asked
the
warbling
to
the
woodland
waters
saying
dearest
have
you
heard
have
you
heard
her
she
is
one
of
music
daughters
music
is
her
happy
laugh
never
song
so
sweet
by
half
but
it
answered
not
a
word
iii
next
i
asked
the
evening
sky
hanging
out
its
lamps
of
fire
saying
loved
one
passed
she
by
tell
me
tell
me
evening
sky
she
the
star
of
my
desire
and
hair
sister
whom
the
pleiads
lost
but
it
never
made
reply
iv
where
is
she
ah
where
is
she
she
to
whom
both
love
and
duty
bind
me
yea
where
is
she
ah
where
is
she
symbol
of
the
beauty
i
have
lost
her
help
my
heart
find
her
nevermore
to
woe
is
me
ah
woe
is
me
meeting
and
parting
i
when
from
the
tower
like
some
sweet
flower
the
bell
drops
petals
of
the
hour
that
says
the
world
is
homing
my
heart
puts
off
its
garb
of
care
and
clothes
itself
in
gold
and
vair
and
hurries
forth
to
meet
her
there
within
the
purple
gloaming
it
oh
how
slow
the
hours
go
how
dull
the
moments
move
till
soft
and
clear
the
bells
i
hear
that
say
like
music
in
my
ear
go
meet
the
one
you
love
ii
when
curved
and
white
a
bugle
bright
the
moon
blows
glamour
through
the
night
that
sets
the
world
my
heart
where
gladness
late
was
guest
puts
off
its
joy
as
to
my
breast
at
parting
her
dear
form
is
pressed
within
the
moon
faint
gleaming
it
oh
how
fast
the
hours
passed
they
were
not
slow
enough
too
soon
too
soon
the
sinking
moon
says
to
my
soul
like
some
sad
tune
come
part
from
her
you
love
love
in
a
garden
i
between
the
rose
and
the
canna
crimson
beneath
her
window
in
the
night
i
stand
the
jeweled
dew
hangs
little
stars
in
rims
on
the
white
moonflowers
each
a
spirit
hand
that
points
the
path
to
mystic
shadowland
awaken
sweet
and
fair
and
add
to
night
thy
grace
suffer
its
loveliness
to
share
the
white
moon
of
thy
face
the
darkness
of
thy
hair
awaken
sweet
and
fair
ii
a
moth
like
down
swings
on
th
althæa
pistil
ghost
of
a
tone
that
haunts
its
bell
deep
dome
and
in
the
cone
of
crystal
a
firefly
blurs
the
lantern
of
a
gnome
green
as
a
gem
that
gleams
through
hollow
foam
approach
the
moment
flies
thou
sweetheart
of
the
south
come
mingle
with
night
mysteries
the
red
rose
of
thy
mouth
the
starlight
of
thine
approach
the
moment
flies
iii
dim
through
the
dusk
like
some
unearthly
presence
bubbles
the
of
some
wild
bird
and
with
it
borne
faint
on
a
essence
the
rainy
murmur
of
a
fountain
heard
as
if
young
lips
had
breathed
a
perfumed
word
how
long
my
love
my
bliss
how
long
must
i
await
with
night
that
all
impatience
is
thy
greeting
at
the
gate
and
at
the
gate
thy
kiss
how
long
my
love
my
bliss
floridian
i
the
cactus
and
the
aloe
bloom
beneath
the
window
of
your
room
your
window
where
at
evenfall
beneath
the
twilight
first
pale
star
you
linger
tall
and
spiritual
and
hearken
my
guitar
it
is
the
hour
when
every
flower
is
wooed
by
moth
or
bee
would
would
you
were
the
flower
dear

i
the
moth
to
draw
you
near

draw
you
near
to
me

dear
to
draw
you
near
to
me
ii
the
jasmine
and
bignonia
spill
their
balm
around
your
windowsill
the
sill
where
when
in
foliage
mists
the
moon
hangs
far
you
lean
with
bright
deep
eyes
of
night
and
hearken
my
guitar
it
is
the
hour
when
from
each
flower
the
wind
woos
fragrances
would
would
you
were
the
flower
love
and
i
the
wind
to
breathe
above
to
breathe
above
and
kiss
my
love
to
breathe
above
and
kiss
the
golden
hour
i
she
comes
the
dreamy
daughter
of
day
and
night
a
girl
who
the
western
water
lifts
up
her
moon
of
pearl
like
some
rebecca
at
the
well
who
fills
her
jar
of
crystal
shell
down
ways
of
dew
dale
and
dell
dusk
comes
with
dreams
of
you
of
you
dusk
comes
with
dreams
of
you
ii
she
comes
the
serious
sister
of
all
the
stars
that
strew
the
deeps
of
god
and
glister
bright
on
the
darkling
blue
like
some
loved
ruth
who
heaps
her
arm
with
golden
gleanings
of
the
farm
down
fields
of
stars
where
shadows
swarm
dusk
comes
with
thoughts
of

she
comes

soft
winds

two

soft

at
me

when
all
the
world
was
white
with
flowers
and
summer
in
her
towers
stood
smiling
her
handmaid
hours
who
robed
her
limbs
for
bridal
somewhere
between
the
golden
sands
and
purple
hills
of
folly
lands
love
with
a
laugh
let
go
our
hands
and
left
our
sides
to
idle
ii
now
all
the
world
is
red
with
doom
and
autumn
in
her
room
bends
darkly
the
gipsy
loom
of
memories
she
weaves
there
who
knocks
at
night
upon
the
door
all
and
pale
and
poor
open
and
let
him
in
once
more
the
love
that
stands
and
grieves
there
transubstantiation
i
a
sunbeam
and
a
drop
of
dew
lay
on
a
red
rose
in
the
south
god
took
the
three
and
made
her
mouth
her
sweet
sweet
mouth
so
red
of
hue
the
burning
baptism
of
his
kiss
still
fills
my
heart
with
heavenly
bliss
ii
a
dream
of
truth
and
love
come
true
slept
on
a
star
in
daybreak
skies
god
mingled
these
and
made
her
eyes
her
dear
dear
eyes
so
gray
of
hue
the
high
communion
of
his
gaze
still
fills
my
soul
with
deep
amaze
helen
heaped
in
raven
loops
and
masses
over
temples
smooth
and
fair
have
you
marked
it
as
she
passes
gleam
and
shadow
mingled
there
braided
strands
of
midnight
air
helen
hair
deep
with
dreams
and
starry
mazes
of
the
thought
that
in
them
lies
have
you
seen
them
as
she
raises
them
in
gladness
or
surprise
two
gray
gleams
of
daybreak
skies
helen
eyes
moist
with
dew
and
honied
wafters
of
a
music
sweet
that
slips

you
marked

brimmed
with
song
and
sunshine
to
their
tips

fragrance

he
who
sees
her
needs
must
love
her

who
loves

discover

masterpiece

a
cameo
why
speak

giamschid
rubies
whence
rosy

the

why
tell
me
of
the

that
kings

prize
i

the
sapphires
of
her

go

you
will
not
find
a
cameo
like
her
god
carved
for
me
la
jeunesse
et
la

unto
her
fragrant
face
and
hair
as
some
wild
bee
unto
a
rose
that
blooms
in
splendid
beauty
there
within
the
south
my
longing
goes
my
longing
that
is
over
fain
to
call
her
mine
but
all
in
vain
since
jealous
death
as
each
one
knows
is
guardian
of
la
belle
heléne
of
her
whose
face
is
very
fair
to
my
despair
sweet
belle
heléne
ii
the
sweetness
of
her
face
suggests
the
sensuous
scented
jacqueminots
magnolia
blooms
her
throat
and
breasts
her
hands
long
lilies
in
repose
fair
flowers
all
without
a
stain
that
grow
for
death
to
pluck
again
within
that
garden
radiant
close
the
body
of
la
belle
heléne
the
garden
glad
that
she
suggests
that
death
invests
sweet
belle
heléne
iii
god
had
been
kinder
to
me
when
he
dipped
his
hands
in
fires
and
snows
and
made
you
like
a
to
ken
a
that
in
earth
garden
grows
had
he
for
pleasure
or
for
pain
instead
of
death
in
that
demesne
made
love
the
gardener
to
that
rose
your
loveliness
o
belle
heléne
god
had
been
kinder
to
me
then
and
to
all
men
sweet
belle
heléne
love
and
loss
loss
molds
our
lives
in
many
ways
and
fills
our
souls
with
guesses
upon
our
hearts
sad
hands
it
lays
like
some
grave
priest
that
blesses
far
better
than
the
love
we
win
that
earthly
passions
leaven
is
love
we
lose
that
knows
no
sin
that
points
the
path
to
heaven
love
whose
soft
shadow
brightens
earth
through
whom
our
dreams
are
nearest
and
loss
through
whom
we
see
the
worth
of
all
that
we
held
dearest
not
joy
it
is
but
misery
that
chastens
us
and
sorrow
perhaps
to
make
us
all
that
we
expect
beyond
within
that
life
where
time
and
fate
are
not
that
knows
no
seeming
that
world
to
which
death
keeps
the
gate
where
love
and
loss
sit
dreaming
sunset
clouds
low
clouds
the
lightning
veins
and
cleaves
torn
from
the
forest
of
the
storm
sweep
westward
like
enormous
leaves
field
and
farm
and
in
the
west
on
burning
skies
their
wrath
is
quenched
their
hate
is
hushed
and
deep
their
drifted
thunder
lies
with
splendor
flushed
the
black
turns
gray
the
gray
turns
gold
and
seaed
in
deeps
of
radiant
rose
summits
of
fire
manifold
they
now
repose
what
dreams
they
bring
what
thoughts
reveal
that
have
their
source
in
loveliness
through
which
the
doubts
i
often
feel
grow
less
and
less
through
which
i
see
that
other
night
that
cloud
called
death
transformed
of
love
to
flame
and
pointing
with
its
light
to
life
above
masked
lying
alone
i
dreamed
a
dream
last
night
methought
that
joy
had
come
to
comfort
me
for
all
the
past
its
suffering
and
slight
yet
in
my
heart
i
felt
this
could
not
be
all
that
he
said
unreal
seemed
and
strange
too
beautiful
to
last
beyond
then
suddenly
his
features
seemed
to
change
the
mask
of
joy
dropped
from
the
face
of
sorrow
out
of
the
depths
i
let
me
forget
her
face
so
fresh
so
lovely
the
abiding
place
of
tears
and
smiles
that
won
my
heart
to
her
of
dreams
and
moods
that
moved
my
soul
dim
deeps
as
strong
winds
stir
dark
waters
where
the
starlight
glimmering
in
every
lineament
the
mind
can
trace
let
me
forget
her
face
ii
let
me
forget
her
form
soft
and
seductive
that
contained
each
charm
each
grace
the
sweet
word
maidenhood
implies
and
all
the
sensuous
youth
of
line
and
curve
that
makes
men
eyes
bondsmen
of
beauty
eager
still
to
in
every
part
that
memory
can
warm
let
me
forget
her
form
iii
let
me
forget
her
god
her
who
made
honeyed
love
a
bitter
rod
to
scourge
my
heart
with
barren
with
despair
to
tear
my
soul
with
sick
with
vain
desire
oh
hear
my
prayer
out
of
the
hell
of
love
unquenchable
fire
i
cry
to
thee
with
face
against
the
sod
let
me
forget
her
god
riches
what
mines
the
morning
heavens
unfold
what
far
alaskas
of
the
skies
that
veined
with
elemental
gold
sierra
on
sierra
rise
heap
up
the
gold
of
all
the
world
the
ore
that
makes
men
fools
and
slaves
what
is
it
to
the
gold
that
rivers
through
the
sunset
caves
search
earth
for
riches
all
who
will
the
gold
that
soils
that
turns
to
dust
be
mine
the
wealth
no
thief
can
steal
the
gold
of
god
that
can
not
rust
beauty
and
art
the
gods
are
dead
but
still
for
me
lives
on
in
wildwood
brook
and
tree
each
myth
each
old
divinity
for
me
still
laughs
among
her
rocks
the
naiad
and
the
dryad
locks
drop
perfume
on
the
flocks
the
satyr
hoof
still
prints
the
loam
and
whiter
than
the
foam
the
oread
haunts
her
mountain
home
to
him
whose
mind
is
fain
to
dwell
with
loveliness
no
time
can
quell
all
things
are
real
imperishable
to
him
whatever
facts
may
say
who
sees
the
soul
beneath
the
clay
is
proof
of
a
diviner
day
the
very
stars
and
flowers
preach
a
gospel
old
as
god
and
teach
philosophy
a
child
may
reach
that
can
not
die
that
shall
not
cease
that
lives
through
idealities
of
beauty
as
rome
and
greece
that
lift
the
soul
above
the
clod
and
working
out
some
period
of
art
are
part
and
proof
of
god
the
age
of
gold
the
clouds
that
tower
in
storm
that
beat
arterial
thunder
in
their
veins
the
wildflowers
lifting
shyly
sweet
their
perfect
faces
from
the
plains
all
high
all
lowly
things
of
earth
for
no
vague
end
have
had
their
birth
low
strips
of
mist
that
mesh
the
moon
above
the
foaming
waterfall
and
mountains
that
god
hand
hath
hewn
and
forests
where
the
great
winds
call
within
the
grasp
of
such
as
see
are
parts
of
a
conspiracy
to
seize
the
soul
with
beauty
hold
the
heart
with
love
and
so
fulfill
within
ourselves
the
age
of
gold
that
never
died
and
never
will
so
long
as
one
true
nature
feels
the
wonders
that
the
world
reveals
the
love
of
loves
i
have
not
seen
her
face
and
yet
she
is
more
sweet
than
any
thing
of
earth
than
rose
or
violet
that
mayday
winds
and
sunbeams
bring
of
all
we
know
past
or
to
come
that
beauty
holds
within
its
net
she
is
the
high
compendium
and
yet
i
have
not
touched
her
robe
and
still
she
is
more
dear
than
lyric
words
and
music
or
than
strains
that
fill
the
throbbing
throats
of
forest
birds
of
all
we
mean
by
poetry
that
rules
the
soul
and
charms
the
will
she
is
the
deep
epitome
and
still
she
is
my
world
ah
pity
me
a
dream
that
flies
whom
i
pursue
whom
all
pursue
they
be
who
toil
for
art
and
dare
and
do
the
for
whom
they
sigh
the
far
ideal
affinity
for
whom
they
live
and
gladly
die
ah
me
three
things
there
are
three
things
of
earth
that
help
us
more
than
those
of
heavenly
birth
that
all
implore
than
love
or
faith
or
hope
for
which
we
strive
and
grope
the
first
one
is
desire
who
takes
our
hand
and
fills
our
hearts
with
fire
none
may
withstand
through
whom
we
lifted
far
above
both
moon
and
star
the
second
one
is
dream
who
leads
our
feet
by
an
immortal
gleam
to
visions
sweet
through
whom
our
forms
put
on
dim
attributes
of
dawn
the
last
of
these
is
toil
who
maketh
true
within
the
world
turmoil
the
other
two
through
whom
we
may
behold
ourselves
with
kings
enrolled
immortelles
i
as
some
warm
moment
of
repose
in
one
rich
rose
sums
all
the
summer
lovely
bloom
and
pure
perfume
so
did
her
soul
epitomize
all
hopes
that
make
life
wise
who
lies
before
us
now
with
lidded
eyes
faith
amaranth
of
truth
crowning
her
youth
ii
as
some
melodious
note
or
strain
may
so
contain
all
of
sweet
music
in
one
chord
or
lyric
word
so
did
her
loving
heart
suggest
all
dreams
that
make
life
blest
who
lies
before
us
now
with
pulseless
breast
love
asphodel
of
duty
crowning
her
beauty
a
lullaby
i
in
her
wimple
of
wind
and
her
slippers
of
sleep
the
twilight
comes
like
a
little
herding
her
owls
with
many
her
little
brown
owls
in
the
woodland
deep
where
dimly
she
walks
in
her
whispering
shoes
and
gown
of
glimmering
pearl

and
after
the

comes
midnight
who
wears
a
mantle
of
purple
so
old
so
old
who
stables
the

it
is
said
in
a
wonderful
chamber
with
violet
stairs
up
which
you
can
see
her
come
silent
of

on

of
pale

the

there
on

through

let
us
usher
in
philosophies
of
old
anacreon
and
omar
that
from
dawn
to
glorious
dawn
shall
lesson
us
in
love
and
song
and
sin
ii
some
lives
need
less
than
who
can
ever
say
truly
thou
art
mine
of
happiness
death
comes
to
all
and
one
is
never
sure
of
that
may
ban
or
bless
and
what
beyond
is
but
a
shadowy
guess
all
all
is
vanity
the
preacher
sighs
and
in
this
world
what
has
more
right
than
wrong
come
let
us
hush
remembrance
with
a
song
and
learn
with
folly
to
be
glad
and
wise
iii
there
was
a
poet
of
the
east
named
hafiz
who
sang
of
wine
and
beauty
let
us
go
praising
them
too
and
where
good
wine
to
quaff
is
and
maids
to
kiss
doff
life
gray
garb
of
woe
for
soon
that
tavern
reached
that
inn
you
know
where
wine
and
love
are
not
where
sans
disguise
each
one
must
lie
in
his
strait
bed
apart
the
thorn
of
sleep
in
his
heart
and
dust
and
darkness
in
his
mouth
and
eyes
failure
there
are
some
souls
whose
lot
it
is
to
set
their
hearts
on
goals
that
adverse
fate
controls
while
others
win
with
little
labor
through
life
dust
and
din
and
enter
in
immortal
gates
and
of
success
the
intimates
inherit
fame
estates
why
is
the
lot
of
merit
oft
to
struggle
and
yet
not
attain
to
toil
for
what
simply
to
know
the
disappointment
the
despair
and
woe
of
effort
here
below
ambitious
still
to
reach
those
lofty
peaks
which
men
aspiring
preach
for
which
their
souls
beseech
those
heights
that
swell
remote
removed
and
unattainable
pinnacle
on
pinnacle
still
yearning
to
attain
their
far
repose
above
life
stress
and
strain
but
all
in
vain
in
vain
why
hath
god
put
great
longings
in
some
souls
and
straightway
shut
all
doors
of
their
clay
hut
the
clay
accurst
that
holds
achievement
back
from
which
immersed
the
spirit
may
not
burst
were
it
at
least
not
better
to
have
sat
at
circe
feast
if
afterwards
a
beast
than
aye
to
bleed
to
strain
and
strive
to
toil
in
thought
and
deed
and
nevermore
succeed
the
cup
of
joy
let
us
mix
a
cup
of
joy
that
the
wretched
may
employ
whom
the
fates
have
made
their
toy
who
have
given
brain
and
heart
to
the
thankless
world
of
art
and
from
fame

glamour
flits
from

her
form
a
pearly
light
is
shed
as
from
a
lily
in
a
a
firefly
gleam
her
face
is
pale
as
stone
and
languid
as
a
cloud
that
drifts
alone
in
starry
and
her
diaphanous
feet
are
easy
as
the
dew

opaline
heat

lo
with
ears
aurora
pink
as
dawn
she
leans
and
listens
on
the
brink
of
being
dark
with
dreadfulness
and
doubt
wherein
vague
lights
and
shadows
move
about
and

beat

huge
heart

surging
pulse
of
which
we

her
divining
eyes

like
the
curved
moon
over
twilight

with

she
fathoms
life

death
gulfs
where
man
conscience
like
a
restless
breath
of
wind
goes
whispering
low
of
things
the
irremediable
where
sorrow
clings
around
her
limbs
a
veil
of
woven
mist
wavers
and
turns
from
fibered
amethyst
to
textured
crystal
through
which
symboled
bars
of
silver
burn
and
cabalistic
stars
of
nebulous
gold
shrouding
her
feet
and
hair
within
this
woof
fantastic
everywhere
dreams
come
and
go
the
instant
images
of
things
she
sees
and
thinks

with
which
her
heart
and

in

by

waterside
when
soft
as
mist
before
me
stood
my
sweetheart
who
had
died
but
so
unchanged
was
she
meseemed
that
i
had
only
dreamed
her
dead
glad
in
her
eyes
the
gleamed
her
lips
were
warm
and
red
what
though
the
stars
shone
shadowy
through
her
form
as
by
my
side
she
went
and
by
her
feet
no
drop
of
dew
was
stirred
no
blade
was
bent
what
though
through
her
white
loveliness
the
wildflower
dimmed
the
moonlight
paled
real
to
my
touch
she
was
no
less
than
when
the
earth
prevailed
she
took
my
hand
my
heart
beat
wild
she
kissed
my
mouth
i
bowed
my
head
then
gazing
in
my
eyes
she
smiled
when
thou
die
she
said
the
man
in
gray
for
the
reunion
of
the
confederate
veterans
at
louisville
may
and

again
in
dreams
the
veteran
hears
the
bugle
and
the
drum
again
the
boom
of
battle
nears
again
the
bullets
hum
again
he
mounts
again
he
cheers
again
his
charge
speeds
home
o
memories
of
those
long
gone
years
o
years
that
are
to
come
we
live
in
dreams
as
well
as
deeds
in
thoughts
as
well
as
acts
and
life
through
things
we
feel
not
know
is
realized
the
most
the
conquered
are
the
conquerors
despite
the
face
of
facts
if
they
still
feel
their
cause
was
just
who
fought
for
it
and
lost

again
in
thought
he
hears
at
dawn
the
far
reveille
die
again
he
marches
stern
and
wan
beneath
a
burning
sky
he
bivouacs
the
night
comes
on
his
comrades
him
lie
o
memories
of
the
years
long
gone
o
years
that
now
go
by
the
vintager
of

war
is
war
whose
grapes
are
men
into
his
armies
go
his
steaming
red
the
crimson
vats
of
battle
where
he
stalks
as
in
a
den
drunk
with
the
must
of
hell
that
spurts
beneath
his
iron
tread
iii
again
in
mind
he
lying
where
the
trenches
slay
with
heat
again
his
flag
floats
him
fair
in
charge
or
fierce
retreat
again
all
lost
again
despair
makes
death
seem
three
times
sweet
o
years
of
tears
that
crowned
his
hair
with
laurels
of
defeat
there
is
reward
for
those
who
dare
for
those
who
dare
and
do
who
face
the
dark
inevitable
who
fall
and
know
no
shame
upon
their
banner
triumph
sits
and
in
the
horn
they
blew
naught
lost
if
honor
be
not
lost
defeat
is
but
a
name
it
was
down
in
the
woodland
on
last
where
silence
and
darkness
had
built
them
a
lair
that
i
felt
the
dim
presence
of
her
the
unseen
and
heard
her
still
step
on
the
air
it
was
last
in
the
glimmer
and
swoon
of
mist
and
of
moonlight
that
thickened
and
thinned
that
i
saw
the
gray
gleam
of
her
eyes
in
the
moon
and
hair
like
a
raven
blown
wild
in
the
wind
it
was
last
where
starlight
and
dew
made
mystical
marriage
on
flower
and
leaf
that
she
led
me
with
looks
of
a
love
that
i
knew
and
lured
with
the
voice
of
a
grief
it
was
last
in
the
forest
of
dreams
where
trees
are
eidolons
and
shadows
have
eyes
that
i
saw
her
pale
face
like
the
foam
of
far
streams
and
heard
like
the
her
tears
and
her
sighs
it
was
last
the
haunted
the
dread
in
the
wood
by
the
pine
that
i
who
am
living
kept
tryst
with
the
dead
and
clasped
her
a
moment
and
dreamed
she
was
mine
the
image
in
the
glass
i
the
slow
reflection
of
a
woman
face
grew
as
by
witchcraft
in
the
oval
space
of
that
strange
glass
on
which
the
moon
looked
in
as
cruel
as
death
beneath
the
auburn
hair
the
dark
eyes
burned
and
the
faultless
chin
evil
as
night
yet
as
the
daybreak
fair
and
sensual
smiled
the
mouth
of
sin
ii
the
glorious
throat
and
shoulders
and
twin
crests
of
snow
the
splendid
beauty
of
the
breasts
filled
soul
and
body
with
the
old
daughter
of
darkness
how
could
this
thing
be
you
whom
i
loathed
for
whom
my
heart
fierce
fire
had
burnt
to
ashes
of
satiety
you
who
had
sunk
my
soul
in
all
that
dire
iii
how
came
your
image
there
and
in
that
room
where
she
the
all
adored
my
life
sweet
bloom
died
poisoned
she
my
scarcely
one
week
bride
yea
poisoned
by
a
gift
you
sent
to
her
thinking
her
death
would
win
me
to
your
side
and
so
it
did
but
well
it
made
some
stir
by
your
own
hand
i
think
they
said
you
died
iv
time
passed
and
then
was
it
the
curse
of
crime
that
night
of
nights
which
forced
my
feet
to
climb
to
that
locked
was
midnight
when
a
longing
like
to
madness
mastered
me
compelled
me
to
that
chamber
which
for
ten
sad
years
was
sealed
a
dark
necessity
to
gaze
upon
i
knew
not
what
again
love
ghost
perhaps
or
in
the
curvature
of
that
strange
mirror
something
that
might
cure
the
ache
in
me
some
message
said
perchance
of
her
dead
loveliness
which
once
it
glassed
that
might
repeat
again
my
lost
romance
in
momentary
pictures
of
the
past
while
in
its
depths
her
image
swam
in
trance
vi
i
did
not
dream
to
see
the
soulless
eyes
of
you
i
hated
nor
the
lips
where
lies
and
kisses
curled
your
features
that
were
tuned
to
all
demonic
smiling
up
as
might
some
deep
damnation
while
my
god
i
swooned
oozed
slowly
out
between
the
breast
dead
white
the
ghastly
red
of
that
wide
her
prayer
she
kneels
with
haggard
eyes
and
hair
unto
the
christ
upon
the
cross
her
gown
is
torn
her
feet
are
bare
what
is
this
thing
she
begs
of
him
the
gentle
christ
upon
the
cross
her
hands
are
clasped
her
face
is
dim
is
it
forgiveness
for
her
sin
she
asks
of
christ
upon
the
cross
and
mercy
for
the
soul
within
with
anguished
face
so
sad
and
sweet
she
kneels
to
christ
upon
the
cross
her
arms
embrace
his
feet
her
tears
run
slowly
down
her
face
o
piteous
christ
upon
the
cross
and
through
her
tears
she
sighs
and
says
the
thing
that
i
would
crave
of
thee
o
christ
upon
the
cruel
cross
is
not
a
thing
to
comfort
me
thou
who
hast
taught
us
to
forgive
o
tender
christ
upon
the
cross
help
thou
my
love
for
to
live
oh
let
the
love
that
was
my
fall
o
loving
christ
upon
the
cross
still
to
my
life
be
all
in
all
with
love
for
him
who
loves
no
more
o
patient
christ
upon
the
cross
make
thou
my
punishment
full
sore
she
kneels
with
haggard
eyes
and
hair
unto
the
christ
upon
the
cross
her
gown
is
torn
her
feet
are
bare
the
message
of
the
lilies
my
soul
and
i
went
walking
beneath
the
moon
of
spring
the
lilies
pale
were
talking
were
faintly
murmuring
from
dimly
moonlit
places
they
thrust
long
throats
of
white
and
lovely
lifted
faces
of
fragrant
snow
and
light
their
language
was
an
essence
yet
clearer
than
a
bird
and
from
it
grew
a
presence
as
music
grows
from
words
a
spirit
born
of
silence
and
chastity
and
dew
among
elysian
islands
were
not
more
white
to
view
a
spirit
born
of
fire
and
holiness
and
snow
within
the
heavens
desire
were
not
more
pure
to
know
he
smiled
amid
them
lifting
pale
hands
of
prayer
and
peace
and
through
the
moonlight
drifting
came
words
to
me
like
these
we
are
his
lilies
lilies
whose
praises
aye
we
sing
we
are
the
lilies
lilies
of
christ
our
lord
and
king
a
legend
of
the
lily
pale
as
a
star
that
shines
through
rain
her
face
was
seen
at
the
her
sad
frail
face
that
watched
in
vain
the
face
of
a
girl
whose
brow
was
wan
to
whom
the
kind
sun
spoke
at
dawn
and
a
star
and
the
moon
when
the
day
was
gone
and
oft
and
often
the
sun
had
said
o
fair
white
face
o
sweet
fair
head
come
talk
with
me
of
the
love
that
dead
and
she
would
sit
in
the
sun
awhile
down
in
the
garth
by
the
old
where
never
again
would
he
make
her
smile
and
often
the
first
bright
star
had
whispered
sweet
where
the
rose
blooms
red
come
look
with
me
for
the
love
that
dead
and
she
would
wait
with
the
star
she
knew
where
the
fountain
splashed
and
the
roses
blew
where
never
again
would
he
come
to
woo
and
oft
the
moon
when
she
lay
in
bed
had
sighed
dear
heart
in
the
orchardstead
come
dream
with
me
of
the
love
that
dead
and
she
would
stand
in
the
moon
the
dim
where
the
fruit
made
heavy
the
apple
limb
where
never
again
would
she
dream
with
him
so
summer
passed
and
the
autumn
came
and
the
boughs
were
touched
with
flame
but
her
life
and
her
sorrow
remained
the
same
or
if
she
changed
as
it
comes
about
a
life
may
change
through
trouble
and
doubt
as
a
candle
flickers
and
then
goes
out
was
only
to
grow
more
quiet
and
wan
sadly
waiting
at
dusk
and
at
dawn
for
the
coming
of
love
forever
gone
and
so
one
night
when
the
star
looked
in
it
kissed
her
face
that
was
white
and
thin
and
murmured
come
thou
free
of
sin
and
when
the
moon
on
another
night
beheld
her
lying
still
and
white
it
sighed
is
well
now
all
is
right
and
when
one
morning
the
sun
arose
and
they
bore
her
bier
down
the
it
touched
her
saying
at
last
repose
and
they
laid
her
down
so
young
and
fair
where
the
grass
was
withered
the
bough
was
bare
all
wrapped
in
the
light
of
her
golden
hair
so
autumn
passed
and
the
winter
went
and
spring
like
a
penitent
came
telling
her
beads
of
blossom
and
scent
and
lo
to
the
grave
of
the
beautiful
the
strong
sun
cried
why
art
thou
dull
awake
awake
forget
thy
skull
and
the
evening
star
and
the
moon
above
called
out
o
dust
now
speak
thereof
proclaim
thyself
arise
o
love
and
the
skull
and
the
dust
in
the
darkness
beard
each
icy
germ
in
its
cerements
stirred
as
lazarus
moved
at
the
lord
loud
word
and
a
flower
arose
on
the
mound
of
green
white
as
the
robe
of
the
nazarene
to
testify
of
the
life
unseen
and
i
paused
by
the
grave
then
went
my
way
and
it
seemed
that
i
heard
the
lily
say
here
was
a
miracle
wrought
the
end
of
the
century
there
are
moments
when
as
missions
god
reveals
to
us
strange
visions
when
within
their
separate
stations
we
may
see
the
centuries
like
revolving
constellations
shaping
out
earth
destinies
i
have
gazed
in
time
abysses
where
no
smallest
thing
earth
misses
that
was
hers
once
her
chattels
there
the
past
gigantic
ghost
sits
and
dreams
of
thrones
and
battles
in
the
night
of
ages
lost
far
before
her
eyes
unholy
mist
was
spread
that
darkly
slowly
rolled
aside
like
some
huge
curtain
hung
above
the
land
and
sea
and
beneath
it
wild
uncertain
rose
the
wraiths
of
memory
first
i
saw
colossal
spectres
of
dead
cities
troy
once
pride
then
babylon
and
tyre
karnac
carthage
and
the
gray
walls
of
thebes
apollo
lyre
built
and
rome
and
nineveh
empires
followed
first
in
seeming
old
chaldea
lost
in
dreaming
egypt
next
a
bulk
memnonian
staring
from
her
pyramids
then
assyria
babylonian
night
beneath
her
lids
greece
in
classic
white
sidereal
armored
rome
in
dark
imperial
purple
crowned
with
blood
and
fire
down
the
deeps
barbaric
strode
gaul
and
britain
stalking
by
her
and
tattooed
with
woad
all
around
them
rent
and
scattered
lay
their
gods
with
features
battered
brute
and
human
stone
and
iron
caked
with
gems
and
gnarled
with
gold
temples
that
did
once
environ
these
in
wreck
around
them
rolled
while
i
stood
and
gazed
and
waited
slowly
night
obliterated
all
and
other
phantoms
drifted
out
of
darkness
pale
as
stars
shapes
that
tyrant
faces
lifted
sultans
kings
and
emperors
man
and
steed
in
ponderous
metal
panoplied
they
seemed
to
settle
condors
gaunt
of
devastation
on
the
world
behind
their
march
desolation
conflagration
loomed
before
them
with
her
torch
helmets
flamed
like
fearful
flowers
chariots
rose
and
moving
towers
captains
passed
each
fierce
commander
with
his
gauntlet
on
his
sword
agamemnon
alexander
cæsar
each
led
on
his
horde
huns
and
vandals
wild
invaders
goths
and
arabs
stern
crusaders
each
like
some
terrific
torrent
rolled
above
a
ruined
world
till
a
cataract
abhorrent
seemed
the
swarming
spears
uphurled
banners
and
escutcheons
kindled
by
the
light
of
slaughter
dwindled
in
darkness
the
chimera
of
the
past
was
laid
at
last
but
behold
another
era
from
her
corpse
rose
vague
and
vast
demogorgon
of
the
present
who
in
one
hand
raised
a
crescent
in
the
other
with
submissive
fingers
lifted
up
a
cross
reverent
and
yet
derisive
seemed
she
robed
in
gold
and
dross
in
her
skeptic
eyes
professions
of
great
faith
i
saw
expressions
christian
and
humanitarian
played
around
her
cynic
lip
still
i
knew
her
a
barbarian
by
the
sword
upon
her
hip
and
she
cherished
strange
eidolons
pagan
shadows
platos
solons
from
whose
teachings
she
indentured
forms
of
law
and
sophistry
seeking
still
for
truth
she
ventured
just
so
far
as
these
could
see
when
she
vanished
i
uplifting
eyes
to
where
the
dawn
was
rifting
darkness
lo
beheld
a
shadow
towering
on
earth
utmost
peaks
whom
morning
eldorado
rivered
gold
in
blinding
streaks
on
her
brow
i
saw
the
stigma
still
of
death
and
life
enigma
filled
her
eyes
around
her
shimmered
folds
of
silence
and
afar
faint
above
her
forehead
glimmered
lone
the
light
of
one
pale
star
then
a
voice
above
or
under
earth
against
her
seemed
to
thunder
questions
wherein
was
repeated
christ
or
cain
and
god
or
beast
and
the
future
turning
pointed
towards
the
east
the
isle
of
voices
the
wind
blew
free
that
morn
that
we
sailed
away
bound
for
favonian
islands
blest
remote
within
the
utmost
west
beyond
the
golden
day
there
we
were
told
each
dream
of
old
each
deed
and
dream
of
youth
each
myth
of
life
divinest
prime
and
every
romance
dear
to
time
put
on
immortal
truth
the
love
undone
the
aim
unwon
the
hope
that
turned
despair
the
thought
unborn
the
dream
that
died
the
unattained
unsatisfied
should
be
accomplished
there
so
we
believed
and
undeceived
a
little
crew
set
sail
a
little
crew
with
hearts
as
stout
as
any
yet
that
faced
a
doubt
and
tore
away
its
veil
and
time
went
by
and
sea
and
sky
had
worn
our
masts
and
decks
when
lo
one
morn
with
canvas
torn
a
phantom
ship
we
came
forlorn
into
the
sea
of
wrecks
there
day
and
night
the
mist
lay
white
and
pale
stars
shone
at
noon
the
sea
around
was
foam
and
fire
and
overhead
hung
wan
a
wire
a
of
moon
and
through
the
mist
all
white
and
whist
gaunt
ships
with
wound
with
rotting
masts
upon
whose
spars
the
corposants
lit
spectre
stars
sailed
by
without
a
sound
and
all
about
now
in
now
out
their
ancient
hulls
was
shed
the
glow
of
green
decay
that
writhed
and
glimmered
in
the
gray
of
canvas
overhead
and
each
that
passed
in
hull
and
mast
seemed
that
wild
ship
that
flees
before
the
tempest
seamen
tell
with
the
curse
of
hell
through
roaring
night
and
seas
ay
many
a
craft
we
left
abaft
upon
that
haunted
sea
but
never
a
hulk
that
clewed
a
sail
or
waved
a
hand
or
answered
hail
and
never
a
man
saw
we
at
last
we
came
where
pouring
flame
in
darkness
and
in
storm
a
vast
volcano
westward
reared
an
awful
summit
like
some
terrific
arm
and
we
could
feel
beneath
our
keel
the
ocean
throb
and
swell
as
if
the
earthquake
there
uncoiled
its
monster
bulk
or
titans
toiled
at
the
red
heart
of
hell
like
madmen
now
we
turned
our
prow
north
towards
an
ocean
weird
of
northern
lights
and
icy
blasts
and
for
ten
moons
with
reeling
masts
and
leaking
hold
we
steered
then
black
as
blood
through
streaming
scud
land
loomed
above
our
boom
a
land
of
iron
gulfs
and
crags
and
cataracts
like
rags
and
caverns
lost
in
gloom
and
burning
white
on
every
height
and
white
in
every
cave
a
naked
spirit
with
a
flame
now
gleamed
now
vanished
went
and
came
above
the
whining
wave
no
mortal
thing
of
foot
or
wing
made
glad
its
steep
and
strand
but
voices
voices
seemingly
vague
voices
of
the
sky
and
sea
peopled
the
demon
land
yea
everywhere
in
earth
and
air
a
lamentation
wept
that
gathering
strength
above
below
now
like
a
mighty
wind
of
woe
around
the
island
swept
and
in
that
sound
it
seemed
was
bound
all
life
despair
of
art
the
bitterness
of
joy
that
died
the
anguish
of
faith
crucified
and
love
that
broke
its
heart
the
ghost
it
seemed
of
all
we
dreamed
of
all
we
had
desired
that
turned
a
curse
an
empty
cry
with
wailing
words
went
trailing
by
in
hope
dead
robes
attired
and
could
this
be
the
land
that
we
had
sought
for
soon
and
late
those
islands
of
the
blest
the
fair
where
we
had
hoped
to
ease
our
care
and
end
the
fight
with
fate
o
lie
that
lured
o
pain
endured
o
years
of
toil
and
thirst
where
we
had
looked
for
blesséd
ground
the
islands
of
the
damned
we
found
and
in
the
end
were
curst
nineteen
hundred
war
and
disaster
famine
and
pestilence
of
the
century
that
comes
behold
them
shaking
their
tremendous
plumes
above
the
world
where
all
the
air
grows
dense
with
rumors
of
destruction
and
a
sense
cadaverous
of
corpses
and
of
tombs
predestined
while
like
monsters
in
the
glooms
bristling
with
battle
shadowy
and
immense
the
nations
rise
in
wild
where
now
the
boast
earth
makes
of
civilization
its
brag
of
christianity
in
vain
we
seek
to
see
them
in
the
dread
eclipse
of
hell
and
horror
all
the
devastation
of
death
triumphant
on
his
hills
of
slain
caverns
of
colossal
cave
aisles
and
abysses
leagues
no
man
explores
of
rock
that
labyrinths
and
night
that
drips
where
everlasting
silence
broods
with
lips
of
adamant
floors
where
forms
such
as
the
adores
laborious
water
carves
whence
echo
ships
pools
where
petrifaction
strips
her
breasts
of
crystal
from
which
crystal
here
where
primordial
fear
the
gorgon
sits
staring
all
life
to
stone
in
ghastly
mirth
i
seem
to
tread
with
awe
no
tongue
can
tell
beneath
vast
domes
by
pits
wrecks
terrific
of
the
ruined
earth
an
ancient
causeway
of
forgotten
hell
of
the
slums
as
old
carousal
and
with
eyes
a
hard
hot
blue
her
hair
a
frowsy
flame
bold
from
her
she
leans
her
mouth
all
insult
and
all
lies
or
and
in
sluttish
gown
with
ribald
mirth
and
words
too
vile
to
name
a
new
doll
tearsheet
glorying
in
her
shame
armed
with
her
falstaff
now
she
takes
the
town
the
flaring
lights
of
saloons
the
reek
of
hideous
gutters
and
black
oaths
of
drunkenness
from
dens
are
to
her
senses
what
the
silvery
chaste
splendor
is
and
what
the
blossoming
growths
of
earth
and
are
to
innocence
the
winds
those
hewers
of
the
clouds
the
winds
that
lair
at
the
four
are
out
i
hear
their
sandals
trample
on
the
height
i
hear
their
voices
trumpet
through
the
air
builders
of
storm
god
workmen
now
they
bear
up
the
steep
stair
of
sky
on
backs
of
might
huge
tempest
bulks
while
sweat
that
blinds
their
sight
the
rain
is
shaken
from
tumultuous
hair
now
sweepers
of
the
firmament
they
broom
like
gathered
dust
the
rolling
mists
along
heaven
floors
of
sapphire
all
the
beautiful
blue
of
skyey
corridor
and
aëry
room
preparing
with
large
laughter
and
loud
song
for
the
white
moon
and
stars
to
wander
through
prototypes
whether
it
be
that
we
in
letters
trace
the
pure
exactness
of
a
woodbird
strain
and
name
it
song
or
with
the
brush
attain
the
high
perfection
of
a
wildflower
face
or
mold
in
difficult
marble
all
the
grace
we
know
as
man
or
from
the
wind
and
rain
catch
elemental
rapture
of
refrain
and
mark
in
music
to
due
time
and
place
the
aim
of
art
is
nature
to
unfold
her
truth
and
beauty
to
the
souls
of
men
in
close
suggestions
in
whose
forms
is
cast
nothing
so
new
but
is
long
eons
old
nothing
so
old
but
is
as
young
as
when
the
mind
conceived
it
in
the
ages
past
touches
in
heavens
of
rivered
blue
that
sunset
dyes
with
glaucous
flame
deep
in
the
west
the
day
stands
or
wading
on
his
way
touches
with
splendor
all
the
twilight
skies
each
cloud
that
like
a
he
tries
with
rosy
foot
transforms
its
sober
gray
to
burning
gold
while
ray
on
crystal
ray
within
his
wake
the
stars
like
bubbles
rise
so
should
the
artist
in
his
work
accord
all
things
with
beauty
and
communicate
his
soul
high
magic
and
divinity
to
all
he
does
and
hoping
no
reward
toil
onward
making
darkness
aureate
with
light
of
worlds
that
are
and
worlds
to
be
the
woman
speaks
why
have
you
come
to
see
me
in
my
shame
a
thing
to
spit
on
to
despise
and
scorn
and
then
to
ask
me
you
by
whom
was
torn
and
then
cast
by
like
some
vile
rag
my
name
what
shelter
could
you
give
me
now
that
blame
and
loathing
would
not
share
that
wolves
of
vice
would
not
besiege
with
eyes
of
glaring
ice
wherein
sin
sat
not
with
her
face
of
flame
you
love
me
god
if
yours
be
love
for
lust
hell
must
invent
another
synonym
if
yours
be
love
then
hatred
is
the
way
to
heaven
and
god
and
not
with
soul
but
dust
must
burn
the
faces
of
the
cherubim
o
lie
of
lies
if
yours
be
love
i
say
love
the
interpreter
thou
art
the
music
that
i
hear
in
sleep
the
poetry
that
lures
me
on
in
dreams
the
magic
thou
that
holds
my
thought
with
themes
of
young
romance
in
revery
mystic
keep
the
lily
aura
and
the
damask
deep
that
clothes
the
rose
the
whispering
soul
that
seems
to
haunt
the
wind
the
rainbow
light
that
streams
like
some
wild
spirit
the
cataract
leap
are
glimmerings
of
thee
and
thy
loveliness
pervading
all
my
world
interpreting
the
marvel
and
the
wonder
these
disclose
for
lacking
thee
to
me
were
meaningless
life
love
and
hope
the
joy
of
every
thing
and
all
the
beauty
that
the
wide
world
knows
unanswered
how
long
ago
it
is
since
we
went
maying
since
she
and
i
went
maying
long
ago
the
years
have
left
my
forehead
lined
i
know
have
thinned
my
hair
around
the
temples
graying
ah
time
will
change
us
yea
i
hear
it
saying
she
too
grows
old
the
face
of
rose
and
snow
has
lost
its
freshness
in
the
hair
brown
glow
some
strands
of
silver
sadly
too
are
straying
the
form
you
knew
whose
beauty
so
enspelled
has
lost
the
litheness
of
its
loveliness
and
all
the
gladness
that
her
blue
eyes
held
tears
and
the
world
have
hardened
with
distress
true
true
i
answer
o
ye
years
that
part
these
things
are
changed
but
is
her
heart
her
heart
earth
and
moon
i
saw
the
day
like
some
great
monarch
die
behind
the
clouds
rich
tapestries
then
clad
in
silences
of
sleep
through
halls
of
skyey
lazuli
the
twilight
like
a
mourning
queen
trailed
by
of
dreams
and
shadowy
mysteries
and
now
the
night
the
child
of
these
in
meditative
loveliness
draws
nigh
earth
like
to
romeo
deep
in
dew
and
scent
beneath
heaven
window
watching
till
a
light
like
some
white
blossom
in
its
square
be
set
lifts
a
faint
face
unto
the
firmament
that
with
the
moon
grows
gradually
bright
bidding
him
climb
and
clasp
his
juliet
pearls
baroque
but
beautiful
between
the
lanes
the
valves
of
nacre
of
a
behold
a
pearl
shaped
like
the
burnished
bell
of
some
strange
blossom
that
long
afternoons
of
summer
coax
to
open
all
the
chaste
lustre
in
it
hues
that
only
dwell
with
purity
it
takes
me
like
a
spell
back
to
a
day
when
whistling
truant
tunes
a
barefoot
boy
i
waded
the
rocks
searching
for
shells
deep
in
the
creek
slow
swirl
unconscious
of
the
pearls
that
me
lay
while
all
her
tomboy
locks
stood
unnoticed
then
a
girl
my
sweetheart
once
the
pearl
i
flung
away
in
the
forest
one
well
might
deem
among
these
miles
of
woods
such
were
the
forests
of
the
holy
grail
broceliand
and
dean
where
clothed
in
mail
the
knights
of
arthur
rode
and
all
the
broods
of
legend
and
where
no
sound
intrudes
upon
the
ear
except
the
glimmering
wail
of
some
far
bird
or
in
some
flowery
swale
a
brook
that
murmurs
to
the
solitudes
might
think
he
hears
the
laugh
of
vivien
blent
with
the
moan
of
merlin
muttering
bound
by
his
own
magic
to
one
stony
spot
and
in
the
cloud
that
looms
above
the
glen
in
which
the
sun
burns
like
the
table
round
might
dream
he
sees
the
towers
of
camelot
enchantment
the
deep
seclusion
of
this
forest
path
which
the
green
boughs
weave
a
canopy
along
which
bluet
and
anemone
spread
a
dim
carpet
where
the
twilight
hath
her
dark
abode
and
sweet
as
aftermath
breathes
has
so
enchanted
me
that
yonder
blossoming
bramble
seems
to
be
some
sylvan
resting
rosy
from
her
bath
has
so
enspelled
me
with
tradition
dreams
that
every
stream
that
twinkling
flows
and
every
bird
that
flutters
wings
of
tan
or
warbles
hidden
to
my
fancy
seems
a
naiad
dancing
to
a
faun
who
blows
wild
woodland
music
on
the
pipes
of
pan
dusk
clouds
upon
a
sky
of
gold
and
their
sheaves
where
like
a
daisy
bloom
left
by
the
reapers
to
the
gathering
gloom
the
star
of
twilight
flames
as
ruth
is
told
dreamed
homesick
the
harvest
fields
of
old
the
dusk
goes
gleaning
color
and
perfume
from
bible
slopes
of
heaven
that
illume
her
pensive
beauty
deep
in
shadows
stoled
hushed
is
the
forest
and
blue
vale
and
hill
are
still
save
for
the
brooklet
sleepily
stumbling
the
stone
its
foam
like
some
white
foot
save
for
the
note
of
one
far
whippoorwill
and
in
my
heart
name
like
some
sweet
bee
within
a
blowing
a
fairy
flute
the
blue
bird
from
morn
till
noon
upon
the
the
tempest
tapped
with
rainy
and
all
the
afternoon
the
blustering
gales
beat
at
the
door
with
furious
feet
of
rain
the
rose
near
which
the
lily
bloom
lay
slain
like
some
red
wound
dripped
by
the
garden
rails
on
which
the
sullen
slug
left
slimy
trails
meseemed
the
sun
would
never
shine
again
then
in
the
drench
long
loud
and
full
of
cheer
a
skyey
herald
tabarded
in
blue
a
bluebird
bugled
and
at
once
a
bow
was
bent
in
heaven
and
i
seemed
to
hear
god
sapphire
spaces
crystallizing
through
the
strata
clouds
in
azure
tremolo
can
such
things
be
meseemed
that
while
she
played
while
lightly
yet
her
fingers
fell
as
roses
bloom
by
bloom
i
listened
dead
within
a
mighty
room
of
some
old
palace
where
great
casements
let
gaunt
moonlight
in
that
glimpsed
a
parapet
of
statued
marble
in
the
arrased
gloom
majestic
pictures
towered
dim
as
doom
the
dreams
of
titian
and
of
tintoret
and
then
it
seemed
along
a
corridor
a
mile
of
oak
a
stricken
footstep
came
hurrying
yet
slow
i
thought
long
centuries
passed
ere
she
entered
she
i
loved
of
yore
for
whom
i
died
who
wildly
wailed
my
name
and
bent
and
kissed
me
on
the
mouth
and
eyes
the
passing
glory
slow
sinks
the
sun
a
great
carbuncle
ball
red
in
the
cavern
of
a
sombre
cloud
and
in
her
garden
where
the
dense
weeds
crowd
among
her
dying
asters
stands
the
fall
like
some
lone
woman
in
a
ruined
hall
dreaming
of
desolation
and
the
shroud
or
through
decaying
woodlands
goes
hugging
the
tatters
of
her
gipsy
shawl
the
gaunt
wind
rises
like
an
angry
hand
and
sweeps
the
sprawling
spider
from
its
web
smites
frantic
music
in
the
twilight
ear
and
all
around
like
melancholy
sand
rains
dead
leaves
down
wild
leaves
that
mark
the
ebb
in
earth
dark
of
another
year
september
the
bubbled
blue
of
spires
foam
of
moonflowers
and
sweet
snows
of
clematis
through
which
september
goes
rich
in
realized
desires
are
flanked
by
hotter
hues
by
tawny
fires
of
acrid
marigolds
that
light
long
rows
of
lamps
and
salvias
red
as
day
red
close
that
torches
seem
by
which
the
month
attires
barbaric
beauty
like
some
asian
queen
towering
imperial
in
her
crown
of
harvest
and
of
vintage
all
her
form
majestic
gold
and
purple
in
her
mien
the
might
of
motherhood
her
baby
brown
abundance
high
on
one
exultant
arm
hoodoo
she
mutters
and
stoops
by
the
lone
bayou
the
little
green
leaves
are
hushed
on
the
trees
an
owl
in
an
oak
cries
and
a
fox
barks
back
where
the
moon
slants
through
the
moss
that
sways
to
a
sudden
breeze
or
she
sees
whose
eyes
are
coals
in
the
light
o
the
moon
oh
hear
her
croon
oh
woe
to
the
octoroon
she
mutters
and
kneels
and
her
bosom
is
bare
the
little
green
leaves
are
stirred
on
the
trees
a
black
bat
brushes
her
unkempt
hair
and
the
hiss
of
a
snake
glides
her
there
or
is
it
the
voice
of
the
ghostly
breeze
or
she
sees
whose
mouth
is
flame
in
the
light
o
the
moon
oh
hear
her
croon
oh
woe
to
the
octoroon
she
mutters
and
digs
and
buries
it
deep
the
little
green
leaves
are
wild
on
the
trees
and
nearer
and
nearer
the
noises
creep
that
gibber
and
maunder
and
whine
and
weep
or
is
it
the
wave
and
the
weariless
breeze
or
she
sees
which
hobbles
away
in
the
light
o
the
moon
oh
hear
her
croon
oh
woe
to
the
octoroon
in
the
hut
where
the
other
girl
sits
with
him
the
little
green
leaves
hang
limp
on
the
trees
all
on
a
sudden
the
moon
grows
dim
is
it
the
shadow
of
cloud
or
of
limb
cast
in
the
door
by
the
moaning
breeze
or
she
sees
which
limps
and
leers
in
the
light
o
the
moon
oh
hear
it
croon
oh
woe
to
the
octoroon
it
has
entered
in
at
the
open
door
the
little
green
leaves
fall
dead
from
the
trees
and
she
in
the
cabin
lies
stark
on
the
floor
and
she
in
the
woods
has
her
lover
once
more
and
is
it
the
hoot
of
the
dying
breeze
or
who
sees
who
mocks
and
laughs
in
the
light
o
the
moon
oh
hear
him
croon
oh
woe
to
the
octoroon
the
other
woman

have
shut
me
out
from
your
tears
and
grief
over
the
man
laid
low
and
hoary

me
out
from
your
tears
and
grief

me

will
tell

story

love
of
a
man
is
what
do

know
of
his
past
the
years
he
gave
to
another
his
manhood
glory
the
love
of
a
man
is
transitory

to
me
now

your
ears
over
the
dead

done
with
tears
over
the
man
who
loved
to
madness

woman

with
sneers
over
the
dead

done
with
tears

woman

sunk
in
badness

loved
me
ever
and

is
gladness

the
dead

by
the
dead
where
she

in
he

and

gladness

woe

best
of

life

pride

name

wife

the
best
of

life
was
mine

tell
her
this
so

to
cherish

with
pomp
and
flourish

him
now
without
my
kiss
here
is
a
thing
for
your
hearts
to
nourish
bury
him
then
with
pomp
and
flourish
bury
him
now
i
have
told
you
this
a
song
for
labor
oh
the
morning
meads
the
dewy
meads
where
he
ploughs
and
harrows
and
sows
the
seeds
singing
a
song
of
manly
deeds
in
the
blossoming
springtime
weather
the
heart
in
his
bosom
as
high
as
the
word
said
to
the
sky
by
the
mating
bird
while
the
beat
of
an
answering
heart
is
heard
his
heart
and
love
together
ii
oh
the
noonday
heights
the
sunny
heights
where
he
stoops
to
the
harvest
his
keen
scythe
smites
singing
a
song
of
the
work
that
requites
in
the
ripening
summer
weather
the
soul
in
his
body
as
light
as
the
sigh
of
the
little
that
cools
the
sky
while
he
bears
an
answering
soul
reply
his
soul
and
love
together
iii
oh
the
evening
vales
the
twilight
vales
where
he
labors
and
sweats
to
the
thud
of
flails
singing
a
song
of
the
toil
that
avails
in
the
fruitful
autumn
weather
in
heart
and
in
soul
as
free
from
fears
as
the
first
white
star
in
the
sky
that
clears

the
music
of
life
and
of
love
he
hears
of
life

of
love
