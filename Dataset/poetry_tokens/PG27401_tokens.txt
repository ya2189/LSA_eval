shore
across

sea
my
soul
makes
question
of
the
sun
for
thee
and
waves
and
beams
make
answer
when
thy
feet
made
her
ways
flowerier

their
flowers
more
sweet
with
childlike
passage
of
a
god
to
be
like
spray
these
waves
cast
off
her
foemen
fleet
xvi
like
foam
they
flung
it
from

and
like
weed
its
wrecks
were
washed
from
scornful
shoal
to
shoal
from
rock
to
rock
reverberate
and
the
whole
sea
laughed
and
lightened
with
a
deathless
deed
that
sowed
our
enemies
in
her
field
for
seed
and
made
her
shores
fit
harbourage
for
thy
soul
xvii
then
in
her
green
south
fields
a
poor
man
child
thou
hadst
thy
short
sweet
fill
of
joy
that
ripens
all
of
us
for
time
to
cloy
with
pain
and
passion
ere
the
wild
world
caught
thee
by
the
fiery
heart
and
smiled
to
make
so
swift
end
of
the
godlike
boy
xviii
for
thou
if
ever
godlike
foot
there
trod
these
fields
of
ours
wert
surely
like
a
god
who
knows
what
splendour
of
strange
dreams
was
shed
with
sacred
shadow
and
glimmer
of
gold
and
red
from
hallowed
windows
over
stone
and
sod
on
thine
unbowed
bright
insubmissive
head
xix
the
shadow
stayed
not

the
splendour
stays
our
brother
till
the
last
of

day
nor
night
on

earth
shall
be
for
ever
spring
nor
summer
junes
nor
mays
but
somewhat
as
a
sound
or
gleam
of
thee
shall
come
on
us
like
morning
from
the
sea
xx
like
sunrise
never
wholly
risen
nor
yet
quenched
or
like
sunset
never
wholly
set
a
light
to
lighten
as
from
living
eyes
the
cold
unlit
close
lids
of
one
that
lies
dead
or
a
ray
returned
from
death
far
skies
to
fire
us
living
lest
our
lives
forget
xxi
for
in
that
heaven
what
light
of
lights
may
be
what
splendour

one
sunlight
in

no
sunrise

marks
their
day
a
forsaken
garden
in
a
coign
of
the
cliff
between
lowland
and
highland
at
the
edge
between
windward
and
lee
walled
round
with
rocks
as
an
inland
island
the
ghost
of
a
garden
fronts
the
sea
a
girdle
of
brushwood
and
thorn
encloses
the
steep
square
slope
of
the
blossomless
bed
where
the
weeds
that
grew
green
from
the
graves
of
its
roses
now
lie
dead
the
fields
fall
southward
abrupt
and
broken
to
the
low
last
edge
of
the
long
lone
land
if
a
step
should
sound
or
a
word
be
spoken
would
a
ghost
not
rise
at
the
strange
guest
hand
so
long
have
the
grey
bare
walks
lain
guestless
through
branches
and
briars
if
a
man
make
way
he
shall
find
no
life
but
the
restless
night
and
day
the
dense
hard
passage
is
blind
and
stifled
that
crawls
by
a
track
none
turn
to
climb
to
the
strait
waste
place
that
the
years
have
rifled
of
all
but
the
thorns
that
are
touched
not
of
time
the
thorns
he
spares
when
the
rose
is
taken
the
rocks
are
left
when
he
wastes
the
plain
the
wind
that
wanders
the
weeds
these
remain
not
a
flower
to
be
pressed
of
the
foot
that
falls
not
as
the
heart
of
a
dead
man
the
are
dry
from
the
thicket
of
thorns
whence
the
nightingale
calls
not
could
she
call
there
were
never
a
rose
to
reply
over
the
meadows
that
blossom
and
wither
rings
but
the
note
of
a
song
only
the
sun
and
the
rain
come
hither
all
year
long
the
sun
burns
sere
and
the
rain
dishevels
one
gaunt
bleak
blossom
of
scentless
breath
only
the
wind
here
hovers
and
revels
in
a
round
where
life
seems
barren
as
death
here
there
was
laughing
of
old
there
was
weeping
haply
of
lovers
none
ever
will
know
whose
eyes
went
seaward
a
hundred
sleeping
years
ago
heart
handfast
in
heart
as
they
stood
look
thither
did
he
whisper
look
forth
from
the
flowers
to
the
sea
for
the
endure
when
the
wither
and
men
that
love
lightly
may
die
but
we
and
the
same
wind
sang
and
the
same
waves
whitened
and
or
ever
the
garden
last
petals
were
shed
in
the
lips
that
had
whispered
the
eyes
that
had
lightened
love
was
dead
or
they
loved
their
life
through
and
then
went
whither
and
were
one
to
the
end
but
what
end
who
knows
love
deep
as
the
sea
as
a
rose
must
wither
as
the
seaweed
that
mocks
the
rose
shall
the
dead
take
thought
for
the
dead
to
love
them
what
love
was
ever
as
deep
as
a
grave
they
are
loveless
now
as
the
grass
above
them
or
the
wave
all
are
at
one
now
roses
and
lovers
not
known
of
the
cliffs
and
the
fields
and
the
sea
not
a
breath
of
the
time
that
has
been
hovers
in
the
air
now
soft
with
a
summer
to
be
not
a
breath
shall
there
sweeten
the
seasons
hereafter
of
the
flowers

the
lovers
that
laugh
now
or
weep
when
as
they
that
are
free
now
of
weeping
and
laughter
we
shall
sleep
here
death
may
deal
not
again
for
ever
here
change
may
come
not
till
all
change
end
from
the
graves
they
have
made

shall
rise
up
never
who

left
nought
living
to
ravage
and
rend
earth
stones
and
thorns
of
the
wild
ground
growing
while
the
sun
and

rain
live
these
shall
be

upon
all
these
blowing
roll
the

till
the
strength
of
the
waves
of
the
high
tides
humble
the
fields
that
lessen
the
rocks
that
shrink
here
now
in
his
triumph
where
all
things
falter
stretched
out
on
the
spoils
that
his
own
hand
spread
as
a
god
on
his
own
strange
altar
death
lies
dead
relics
this
flower
that
smells
of
honey
and
the
sea
white
laurustine
seems
in
my
hand
to
be
a
white
star
made
of
memory
long
ago
lit
in
the
heaven
of
dear
times
dead
to
me
a
star
out
of
the
skies
love
used
to
know
here
held
in
hand
a
stray
left
yet
to
show
what
flowers
my
heart
was
full
of
in
the
days
that
are
long
since
gone
down
dead
memory
flow
dead
memory
that
revives
on
doubtful
ways
half
hearkening
what
the
buried
season
says
out
of
the
world
of
the
unapparent
dead
where
the
lost
aprils
are
and
the
lost
mays
flower
once
i
knew
thy
brethren
bred
nigh
where
the
last
of
all
the
land
made
head
against
the
sea
a
promontory
flowers
on
salt
wind
and
sprinkled
fed
their
hearts
were
glad
of
the
free
place
glory
the
wind
that
sang
them
all
his
stormy
story
had
talked
all
winter
to
the
sleepless
spray
and
as
the
sea
their
hues
were
hard
and
hoary
like
things
born
of
the
sea
and
the
bright
day
they
laughed
out
at
the
years
that
could
not
slay
live
sons
and
joyous
of
unquiet
hours
and
stronger
than
all
storms
that
range
for
prey
and
in
the
close
indomitable
flowers
a
odour
of
the
sun
and
showers
was
as
the
smell
of
the
fresh
honeycomb
made
sweet
for
mouths
of
none
but
paramours
out
of
the
hard
green
wall
of
leaves
that
clomb
they
showed
like
windfalls
of
the
foam
or
feathers
from
the
weary
wing
fair
as
the
spray
that
it
came
shoreward
from
and
thou
as
white
what
word
hast
thou
to
bring
if
my
heart
hearken
whereof
wilt
thou
sing
for
some
sign
surely
thou
too
hast
to
bear
some
word
far
south
was
taught
thee
of
the
spring
white
like
a
white
rose
not
like
these
that
were
taught
of
the
wind
mouth
and
the
winter
air
poor
tender
thing
of
soft
italian
bloom
where
once
thou
grewest
what
else
for
me
grew
there
born
in
what
spring
and
on
what
city
tomb
by
whose
hand
wast
thou
reached
and
plucked
for
whom
there
hangs
about
thee
could
the
soul
sense
tell
an
odour
as
of
love
and
of
love
doom
of
days
more
sweet
than
thou
wast
sweet
to
smell
of
thoughts
that
came
to
flower
and
fell
of
loves
that
lived
a
lily
life
and
died
of
dreams
now
dwelling
where
dead
roses
dwell
o
white
birth
of
the
golden
that
for
the
sun
love
makes
its
bosom
wide
at
sunrise
and
with
all
its
woods
and
flowers
takes
in
the
morning
to
its
heart
of
pride
thou
hast
a
word
of
that
one
land
of
ours
and
of
the
fair
town
called
of
the
fair
towers
a
word
for
me
of
my
san
gimignan
a
word
of
april
hours
of
the
old
breached
walls
whereon
the
wallflowers
ran
called
of
saint
fina
breachless
now
of
man
though
time
with
soft
feet
break
them
stone
by
stone
who
breaks
down
hour
by
hour
his
own
reign
span
of
the
old
cliff
overcome
and
overgrown
that
all
that
flowerage
clothed
as
flesh
clothes
bone
that
garment
of
acacias
made
for
may
whereof
here
lies
one
witness
overblown
the
fair
brave
trees
with
all
their
flowers
at
play
how
they
stood
up
into
the
day
how
sweet
the
day
was
with
them
and
the
night
such
words
of
message
have
dead
flowers
to
say
this
that
the
winter
and
the
wind
made
bright
and
this
that
lived
upon
italian
light
before
i
throw
them
and
these
words
away
who
knows
but
i
what
memories
too
take
flight
at
a
month
end
the
night
last
night
was
strange
and
shaken
more
strange
the
change
of
you
and
me
once
more
for
the
old
love
love
forsaken
we
went
out
once
more
toward
the
sea
for
the
old
love
dead
and
buried
one
last
time
one
more
and
no
more
we
watched
the
waves
set
in
the
serried
spears
of
the
tide
storming
the
shore
hardly
we
saw
the
high
moon
hanging
heard
hardly
through
the
windy
night
far
waters
ringing
low
reefs
clanging
under
wan
skies
and
waste
white
light
with
chafe
and
change
of
surges
chiming
the
clashing
channels
rocked
and
rang
large
music
wave
to
wild
wave
timing
and
all
the
choral
water
sang
faint
lights
fell
this
way
that
way
floated
quick
sparks
of
keen
like
eyes
from
the
rolled
surf
that
flashed
and
noted
shores
and
faint
cliffs
and
bays
and
skies
the
ghost
of
sea
that
shrank
up
sighing
at
the
sand
edge
a
short
sad
breath
trembling
to
touch
the
goal
and
dying
with
weak
heart
heaved
up
once
in
death
the
rustling
sand
and
shingle
shaken
with
light
sweet
touches
and
small
sound
these
could
not
move
us
could
not
waken
hearts
to
look
forth
eyes
to
look
round
silent
we
went
an
hour
together
under
grey
skies
by
waters
white
our
hearts
were
full
of
windy
weather
clouds
and
blown
stars
and
broken
light
full
of
cold
clouds
and
moonbeams
drifted
and
streaming
storms
and
straying
fires
our
souls
in
us
were
stirred
and
shifted
by
doubts
and
dreams
and
foiled
desires
across
aslant
a
scudding
swam
dipped
and
dropped
and
grazed
the
sea
and
one
with
me
i
could
not
dream
you
and
one
with
you
i
could
not
be
as
the
white
wing
the
white
wave
fringes
touched
and
slid
over
and
flashed
past
as
a
pale
cloud
a
pale
flame
tinges
from
the
moon
lowest
light
and
last
as
a
star
feels
the
sun
and
falters
touched
to
death
by
diviner
eyes
as
on
the
old
gods
untended
altars
the
old
lire
of
withered
worship
dies
once
only
once
the
shrine
relighted
sees
the
last
fiery
shadow
shine
last
shadow
of
flame
and
faith
benighted
sees
falter
and
flutter
and
fail
the
shrine
so
once
with
fiery
breath
and
flying
your

mine
and
went

kissed

sundered

were
content
that
only
touch
that
feeling
only
enough
we
found
we
found
too
much
for
the
unlit
shrine

hardly

the

fire
forgets
to

slight
as

sight
of

with
fear
and
danger
a
bright
beast
of

fiery
kin

mar
only
to

sleek
supple
soul
and

easy
with

to

should

you
for
loving
one

more

you
could
not
tame
your

nor
i
my
sleek
black
pantheress
for
a
new
soul
let
whoso
please
pray
we
are
what
life
made
us
and
shall
be
for
you
the
jungle
and
me
the
and
south
for
you
and
north
for
me
but
this
one
broken
feather
i
throw
you
off
the
hither
wing
splashed
stiff
with
and
salt
weather
this
song
for
sleep
to
learn
and
sing
sing
in
your
ear
when
daytime
over
you
couched
at
long
length
on
hot
sand
with
some
sleek
lover
wince
from
his
breach
as
from
a
brand
till
the
acrid
hour
aches
out
and
ceases
and
the
sheathed
eyeball
sleepier
swims
the
deep
flank
smoothes
its
dimpling
creases
and
passion
loosens
all
the
limbs
till
dreams
of
sharp
grey
weather
fall
faint
upon
your
fiery
sleep
as
on
strange
sands
a
strayed
bird
feather
the
wind
may
choose
to
lose
or
keep
but
i
who
leave
my
queen
of
panthers
as
a
tired
bee
gilt
with
sweet
dust
from
anthers
leaves
the
what
for
me
from
the
ardours
of
the
chaliced
centre
from
the
amorous
anthers
golden
grime
that
scorch
and
smutch
all
wings
that
enter
i
fly
forth
hot
from
but
as
to
a
bee
gilt
thighs
and
winglets
the
with
the
clings
as
a
snake
mobile
rampant
ringlets
leave
the
sand
marked
with
print
of
rings
so
to
my
soul
in
surer
fashion
your
savage
stamp
and
savour
hangs
the
print
and
perfume
of
old
passion
the
mark
of
panther
fangs
sestina
i
saw
my
soul
at
rest
upon
a
day
as
a
bird
sleeping
in
the
nest
of
night
among
soft
leaves
that
give
the
starlight
way
to
touch
its
wings
but
not
its
eyes
with
light
so
that
it
knew
as
one
in
visions
may
and
knew
not
as
men
waking
of
delight
this
was
the
measure
of
my
soul
delight
it
had
no
power
of
joy
to
fly
by
day
nor
part
in
the
large
lordship
of
the
light
but
in
a
secret
way
had
all
its
will
of
dreams
and
pleasant
night
and
all
the
love
and
life
that
sleepers
may
but
such
life
triumph
as
men
waking
may
it
might
not
have
to
feed
its
faint
delight
between
the
stars
by
night
and
sun
by
day
shut
up
with
green
leaves
and
a
little
light
because
its
way
was
as
a
lost
star
way
a
world
not
wholly
known
of
day
or
night
all
loves
and
dreams
and
sounds
and
gleams
of
night
made
it
all
music
that
such
minstrels
may
and
all
they
had
they
gave
it
of
delight
but
in
the
full
face
of
the
fire
of
day
what
place
shall
be
for
any
starry
light
what
part
of
heaven
in
all
the
wide
sun
way
yet
the
soul
woke
not
sleeping
by
the
way
watched
as
a
nursling
of
the
night
and
sought
no
strength
nor
knowledge
of
the
day
nor
closer
touch
conclusive
of
delight
nor
mightier
joy
nor
truer
than
dreamers
may
nor
more
of
song
than
they
nor
more
of
light
for
who
sleeps
once
and
sees
the
secret
light
whereby
sleep
shows
the
soul
a
fairer
way
between
the
rise
and
rest
of
day
and
night
shall
care
no
more
to
fare
as
all
men
may
but
be
his
place
of
pain
or
of
delight
there
shall
he
dwell
beholding
night
as
day
song
have
thy
day
and
take
thy
fill
of
light
before
the
night
be
fallen
across
thy
way
sing
while
he
may
man
hath
no
long
delight
the
year
of
the
rose
from
the
depths
of
the
green
where
the
summer
in
darkness
dozes
till
autumn
pluck
from
his
hand
an
that
holds
not
a
sand
from
the
maze
that
a
encloses
to
the
stones
and
on
the
strand
how
red
was
the
reign
of
the
roses
over
the
land
the
year
of
the
rose
is
brief
from
the
first
blade
blown
to
the
sheaf
from
the
thin
green
leaf
to
the
gold
it
has
time
to
be
sweet
and
grow
old
to
triumph
and
leave
not
a
leaf
for
witness
in
winter
sight
how
lovers
once
in
the
light
would
mix
their
breath
with
its
breath
and
its
spirit
was
quenched
not
of
night
as
love
is
subdued
not
of
death
in
the
land
not
a
mile
of
the
meadows
from
stile
to
stile
of
the
valleys
from
stream
to
stream
but
the
air
was
a
long
sweet
dream
and
the
earth
was
a
sweet
wide
smile
of
a
goddess
returned
from
the
sea
which
had
borne
her
and
burned
that
with
one
swift
smile
of
her
mouth
looked
full
on
the
north
as
it
yearned
and
the
north
was
more
than
the
south
for
the
north
when
winter
was
long
in
his
heart
had
made
him
a
song
and
clothed
it
with
wings
of
desire
and
shod
it
with
shoon
as
of
fire
to
carry
the
tale
of
his
wrong
to
the
wind
by
the
sea
that
none
might
bear
it
but
he
to
the
ear
of
the
goddess
unknown
who
waits
till
her
time
shall
be
to
take
the
world
for
a
throne
in
the
earth
beneath
and
above
in
the
heaven
where
her
name
is
love
she
warms
with
light
from
her
eyes
the
seasons
of
life
as
they
rise
and
her
eyes
are
as
eyes
of
a
dove
but
the
wings
that
lift
her
and
bear
as
an
eagle
and
all
her
hair
as
fire
by
the
wind
breath
curled
and
her
passage
is
song
through
the
air
and
her
presence
is
spring
through
the
world
so
turned
she
northward
and
came
and
the
land
was
aflame
with
the
fires
that
were
shed
from
her
feet
that
the
north
by
her
love
made
sweet
should
be
called
by
a
name
and
a
murmur
was
heard
as
of
doves
and
a
music
beginning
of
loves
in
the
light
that
the
roses
made
such
light
as
the
music
loves
the
music
of
man
with
maid
but
the
days
drop
one
upon
one
and
a
chill
soft
wind
is
begun
in
the
heart
of
the
maze
that
weeps
for
the
roseleaf
days
and
the
reign
of
the
rose
undone
that
ruled
so
long
in
the
light
and
by
spirit
and
not
by
sight
through
the
darkness
thrilled
with
its
breath
still
ruled
in
the
viewless
night
as
love
might
rule
over
death
the
time
of
lovers
is
brief
from
the
fair
first
joy
to
the
grief
that
tells
when
love
is
grown
old
from
the
warm
wild
kiss
to
the
cold
from
the
red
to
the
leaf
they
have
but
a
season
to
seem
as
roseleaves
lost
on
a
stream
that
part
not
and
pass
not
apart
as
a
spirit
from
dream
to
dream
as
a
sorrow
from
heart
to
heart
from
the
bloom
and
the
gloom
that
encloses
the
of
love
where
he
dozes
till
a
relic
be
left
not
of
sand
to
the
that
breaks
in
his
hand
from
the
change
in
the
grey
to
the
last
stray
grass
of
the
strand
a
rain
and
ruin
of
roses
over
the
land
a
wasted
vigil

there
is
no
woman
living
that
draws
breath
so
sad
as
i
though
all
things
sadden
her
there
is
not
one
upon
life
weariest
way
who
is
weary
as
i
am
weary
of
all
but
death
toward
whom
i
look
as
looks
the
sunflower
all
day
with
all
his
whole
soul
toward
the
sun
while
in
the
sun
sight
i
make
moan
all
day
and
all
night
on
my
sleepless
maiden
bed
weep
and
call
out
on
death
o
love
and
thee
that
thou
or
he
would
take
me
to
the
dead
and
know
not
what
thing
evil
i
have
done
that
life
should
lay
such
heavy
hand
on
me
alas
love
what
is
this
thou
wouldst
with
me
what
honour
shall
thou
have
to
quench
my
breath
or
what
shall
my
heart
broken
profit
thee
o
love
o
great
god
love
what
have
i
done
that
thou
shouldst
hunger
so
after
my
death
my
heart
is
harmless
as
my
life
first
day
seek
out
some
false
fair
woman
and
plague
her
till
her
tears
even
as
my
tears
fill
her
bed
i
am
the
least
flower
in
thy
flowery
way
but
till
my
time
be
come
that
i
be
dead
let
me
live
out
my
in
the
sun
though
my
leaves
shut
before
the
sunflower
o
love
love
love
the
kingly
sunflower
shall
he
the
sun
hath
looked
on
look
on
me
that
live
down
here
in
shade
out
of
the
sun
here
living
in
the
sorrow
and
shadow
of
death
shall
he
that
feeds
his
heart
full
of
the
day
care
to
give
mine
eyes
light
or
my
lips
breath
because
she
loves
him
shall
my
lord
love
her
who
is
as
a
worm
in
my
lord
kingly
way
i
shall
not
see
him
or
know
him
alive
or
dead
but
thou
i
know
thee
o
love
and
pray
to
thee
that
in
brief
while
my
brief
be
done
and
the
worm
quickly
make
my
for
underground
there
is
no
sleepless
bed
but
here
since
i
beheld
my
sunflower
these
eyes
have
slept
not
seeing
all
night
and
day
his
sunlike
eyes
and
face
fronting
the
sun
wherefore
if
anywhere
be
any
death
i
would
fain
find
and
fold
him
fast
to
me
that
i
may
sleep
with
the
world
eldest
dead
with
her
that
died
seven
centuries
since
and
her
that
went
last
night
down
the
way
for
this
is
sleep
indeed
when
labour
is
done
without
love
without
dreams
and
without
breath
and
without
thought
o
name
unnamed
of
thee
ah
but
forgetting
all
things
shall
i
thee
wilt
thou
not
be
as
now
about
my
bed
there
underground
as
here
before
the
sun
shall
not
thy
vision
vex
me
alive
and
dead
thy
moving
vision
without
form
or
breath
i
read
long
since
the
bitter
tale
of
her
who
read
the
tale
of
launcelot
on
a
day
and
died
and
had
no
quiet
after
death
but
was
moved
ever
along
a
weary
way
lost
with
her
love
in
the
underworld
ah
me
o
my
king
o
my
lordly
sunflower
would
god
to
me
too
such
a
thing
were
done
but
if
such
sweet
and
bitter
things
be
done
then
flying
from
life
i
shall
not
fly
from
thee
for
in
that
living
world
without
a
sun
thy
vision
will
lay
hold
upon
me
dead
and
meet
and
mock
me
and
mar
my
peace
in
death
yet
if
being
wroth
god
had
such
pity
on
her
who
was
a
sinner
and
foolish
in
her
day
that
even
in
hell
they
twain
should
breathe
one
breath
why
should
he
not
in
some
wise
pity
me
so
if
i
sleep
not
in
my
soft
strait
bed
i
may
look
up
and
see
my
sunflower
as
he
the
sun
in
some
divine
strange
way
o
poor
my
heart
well
knowest
thou
in
what
way
this
sore
sweet
evil
unto
us
was
done
for
on
a
holy
and
a
heavy
day
i
was
arisen
out
of
my
still
small
bed
to
see
the
knights
tilt
and
one
said
to
me
the
king
and
seeing
him
somewhat
stopped
my
breath
and
if
the
girl
spake
more
i
heard
not
her
for
only
i
saw
what
i
shall
see
when
dead
a
kingly
flower
of
knights
a
sunflower
that
shone
against
the
sunlight
like
the
sun
and
like
a
fire
o
heart
consuming
thee
the
fire
of
love
that
lights
the
pyre
of
death
howbeit
i
shall
not
die
an
evil
death
who
have
loved
in
such
a
sad
and
sinless
way
that
this
my
love
lord
was
no
shame
to
thee
so
when
mine
eyes
are
shut
against
the
sun
o
my
soul
sun
o
the
world
sunflower
thou
nor
no
man
will
quite
despise
me
dead
and
dying
i
pray
with
all
my
low
last
breath
that
thy
whole
life
may
be
as
was
that
day
that
that
made
trothplight
death
and
me
giving
the
world
light
of
thy
great
deeds
done
and
that
fair
face
brightening
thy
bridal
bed
that
god
be
good
as
god
hath
been
to
her
that
all
things
goodly
and
glad
remain
with
her
all
things
that
make
glad
life
and
goodly
death
that
as
a
bee
sucks
from
a
sunflower
honey
when
summer
draws
delighted
breath
her
soul
may
drink
of
thy
soul
in
like
way
and
love
make
life
a
fruitful
where
day
may
bring
forth
fruits
of
joy
to
day
and
night
to
night
till
days
and
nights
be
dead
and
as
she
gives
light
of
her
love
to
thee
give
thou
to
her
the
old
glory
of
days
long
done
and
either
give
some
heat
of
light
to
me
to
warm
me
where
i
sleep
without
the
sun
o
sunflower
made
drunken
with
the
sun
o
knight
whose
lady
heart
draws
thine
to
her
great
king
glad
lover
i
have
a
word
to
thee
there
is
a
weed
lives
out
of
the
sun
way
hid
from
the
heat
deep
in
the
meadow
bed
that
swoons
and
whitens
at
the
wind
least
breath
a
flower
that
all
a
summer
day
will
gaze
her
soul
out
on
the
sunflower
for
very
love
till
twilight
finds
her
dead
but
the
great
sunflower
heeds
not
her
poor
death
knows
not
when
all
her
loving
life
is
done
and
so
much
knows
my
lord
the
king
of
me
aye
all
day
long
he
has
no
eye
for
me
with
golden
eye
following
the
golden
sun
from
to
bed
from
birthplace
to
the
place
of
death
from
eastern
end
to
western
of
his
way
so
mine
eye
follows
thee
my
sunflower
so
the
white
turns
and
yearns
to
thee
the
sick
weak
weed
not
well
alive
or
dead
trod
underfoot
if
any
pass
by
her
pale
without
colour
of
summer
or
summer
breath
in
the
shrunk
shuddering
petals
that
have
done
no
work
but
love
and
die
before
the
day
but
thou
and
every
day
be
glad
and
great
o
love
whose
love
slays
me
thy
fervent
flower
made
fruitful
from
the
sun
shall
drop
its
golden
seed
in
the
world
way
that
all
men
thereof
nourished
shall
praise
thee
for
grain
and
flower
and
fruit
of
works
well
done
till
thy
shed
seed
o
shining
sunflower
bring
forth
such
growth
of
the
world
as
like
the
sun
shall
outlive
age
and
death
and
yet
i
would
thine
heart
had
heed
of
her
who
loves
thee
alive
but
not
till
she
be
dead
come
love
then
quickly
and
take
her
utmost
breath
song
speak
for
me
who
am
dumb
as
are
the
dead
from
my
sad
bed
of
tears
i
send
forth
thee
to
fly
all
day
from
sun
birth
to
sun
death
down
the
sun
way
after
the
flying
sun
for
love
of
her
that
gave
thee
wings
and

ere

be
done

seek
the

solicited
under

the
deep
division

prodigious
breasts
the
solemn
slope

asleep
the

thou
found

thou
found
sown

gathered
in
the
gloom

of
despair

of
ill

though
my
flying
song
flies
after
o
sweet
strange
elder
singer
thy
more
fleet
singing

footprints
of
thy
fleeter
feet
some
dim
derision
of
mysterious
laughter
from
the

tongueless
warders

some
gainless
glimpse
of
proserpine

death

winds
a
flying
fire

not

still

thin
flame

us
in
elusive

thee

what

bending
with

the
most
high

fulfil
all
ages

our
god

yearns
xiii
for
sparing
of
his
sacred
strength

the
lord

in
hearts

open

in
lips

soften
with
the
soft
flame
and
heat
of
songs
that
shine
thy
lips
indeed
he
touched
with
bitter
wine

nourished
them
indeed
with
bitter
bread
yet
surely
from
his
hand
thy
soul
food
came
the
fire
that
scarred
thy
spirit
at
his
flame
was
lighted
and
thine
hungering
heart
he
fed
who
feeds
our
hearts
with
fame
xiv
therefore
he
too
now
at
thy
soul
sunsetting
god
of
all
suns
and
songs
he
too
bends
down
to
mix
his
laurel
with
thy
cypress
crown

thy
dust
from
blame

from
forgetting
therefore
he
too
seeing
all
thou
wert

art
compassionate

sad
and
sacred
heart
mourns
thee
of
many
his
children
the
last
dead

hallows
with
strange
tears

alien
sighs
thine
unmelodious
mouth
and
sunless
eyes

over
thine
irrevocable
head
sheds
light
from
the
under

one
weeps
with
him
in
the
ways
lethean
and
stains
with
tears
her
changing
bosom

that
obscure
venus

the
hollow

compel
into
the
footless
places
once

through

thee

have

death
to
thee
that
mine
own

should
wither
from

thou
be
blind
as

as
the

why
should
thy

make
war
on
me
is
it
for
hate
thou
hast
to
find
me
fair
or
for
desire
to
kiss
if
it
might
be
my
very
mouth
of
song
and
kill
me
there
so
with
keen
rains
vexing
his
crownless
hair
with
bright
feet
bruised
from
no
delightful
way
through
darkness
and
the
disenchanted
air
lost
love
went
weeping
half
a
winter
day
and
the
armèd
wind
that
smote
him
seemed
to
say
how
shall
the
dew
live
when
the
dawn
is
fled
or
wherefore
should
the
mayflower
outlast
may
then
death
took
love
by
the
right
hand
and
said
smiling
come
now
and
look
upon
thy
dead
but
love
cast
down
the
glories
of
his
eyes
and
bowed
down
like
a
flower
his
flowerless
head
and
death
spake
saying
what
ails
thee
in
such
wise
being
god
to
shut
thy
sight
up
from
the
skies
if
thou
canst
see
not
hast
thou
ears
to
hear
or
is
thy
soul
too
as
a
leaf
that
dies
even
as
he
spake
with
fleshless
lips
of
fear
but
soft
as
sleep
sings
in
a
tired
man
ear
behold
the
winter
was
not
and
its
might
fell
and
fruits
broke
forth
of
the
barren
year
and
upon
earth
was
largess
of
great
light
and
moving
music
winged
for
worldwide
flight
and
shapes
and
sounds
of
gods
beheld
and
heard
and
day
foot
set
upon
the
neck
of
night
and
with
such
song
the
hollow
ways
were
stirred
as
of
a
god
heart
hidden
in
a
bird
or
as
the
whole
soul
of
the
sun
in
spring
should
find
full
utterance
in
one
word
and
all
the
season
should
break
forth
and
sing
from
one
flower
lips
in
one
rose
triumphing
such
breath
and
light
of
song
as
of
a
flame
made
ears
and
spirits
of
them
that
heard
it
ring
and
love
beholding
knew
not
for
the
same
the
shape
that
led
him
nor
in
face
nor
name
for
he
was
bright
and
great
of
thews
and
fair
and
in
love
eyes
he
was
not
death
but
fame
not
that
grey
ghost
whose
life
is
empty
and
bare
and
his
limbs
moulded
out
of
mortal
air
a
cloud
of
change
that
shifts
into
a
shower
and
dies
and
leaves
no
light
for
time
to
wear
but
a
god
clothed
with
his
own
joy
and
power
a
god
out
of
his
mortal
hour
immortal
king
and
lord
of
time
and
space
with
eyes
that
look
on
them
as
from
a
tower
and
where
he
stood
the
pale
sepulchral
place
bloomed
as
new
life
might
in
a
bloodless
face
and
where
men
sorrowing
came
to
seek
a
tomb
with
funeral
flowers
and
tears
for
grief
and
grace
they
saw
with
light
as
of
a
world
in
bloom
the
portal
of
the
house
of
fame
illume
the
ways
of
life
wherein
we
toiling
tread
and
watched
the
darkness
as
a
brand
consume
and
through
the
gates
where
rule
the
deathless
dead
the
sound
of
a
new
singer
soul
was
shed
that
sang
among
his
kinsfolk
and
a
beam
shot
from
the
star
on
a
new
ruler
head
a
new
star
lighting
the
lethean
stream
a
new
song
mixed
into
the
song
supreme
made
of
all
souls
of
singers
and
their
might
that
makes
of
life
and
time
and
death
a
dream
thy
star
thy
song
o
soul
that
in
our
sight
wast
as
a
sun
that
made
for
man
delight
flowers
and
all
fruits
in
season
being
so
near
the
face
our
god
that
gives
us
light
to
him
of
all
gods
that
we
love
or
fear
thou
amongst
all
men
by
thy
name
wast
dear
dear
to
the
god
that
gives
us
spirit
of
song
to
bind
and
burn
all
hearts
of
men
that
hear
the
god
that
makes
men
words
too
sweet
and
strong
for
life
or
time
or
death
to
do
them
wrong
who
sealed
with
his
thy
spirit
for
a
sign
and
filled
it
with
his
breath
thy
whole
life
long
who
made
thy
moist
lips
fiery
with
new
wine
pressed
from
the
grapes
of
song
the
sovereign
vine
and
with
all
love
of
all
things
loveliest
gave
thy
soul
power
to
make
them
more
divine
that
thou
breathe
upon
the
breathless
rest
of
marble
till
the
brows
and
lips
and
breast
felt
fall
from
off
them
as
a
cancelled
curse
that
speechless
sleep
wherewith
they
lived
opprest
who
gave
thee
strength
and
heat
of
spirit
to
pierce
all
clouds
of
form
and
colour
that
disperse
and
leave
the
spirit
of
beauty
to
remould
in
types
of
clean
chryselephantine
verse
who
gave
thee
words
more
golden
than
fine
gold
to
carve
in
shapes
more
glorious
than
of
old
and
build
thy
songs
up
in
the
sight
of
time
as
statues
set
in
godhead
manifold
in
sight
and
scorn
of
temporal
change
and
clime
that
meet
the
sun
with
refluent
rhyme
as
god
to
god
might
answer
face
to
face
from
lips
whereon
the
morning
strikes
sublime
dear
to
the
god
our
god
who
gave
thee
place
among
the
chosen
of
days
the
royal
race
the
lords
of
light
whose
eyes
of
old
and
ears
saw
even
on
earth
and
heard
him
for
a
space
there
are
the
souls
of
those
once
mortal
years
that
wrought
with
fire
of
joy
and
light
of
tears
in
words
divine
as
deeds
that
grew
thereof
such
music
as
he
swoons
with
love
who
hears
there
are
the
lives
that
lighten
from
above
our
under

the
spheral
souls
that
move
through
the
ancient
heaven
of
air
whence
we
that
hear
them
singing
die
with
love
there
all
the
crowned
hellenic
heads
and
there
the
old
gods
who
made
men
godlike
as
they
were
the
lyric
lips
wherefrom
all
songs
take
fire
live
eyes

with

the

is
made
one

where

the
singing
of
the
sun
all
form
all
sound
all
colour
and
all
thought
are
as
one
body
and
soul
in
unison
there
the
song
sung
shines
as
a
picture
wrought
the
painted
mouths
sing
that
on
earth
say
nought
the
carven
limbs
have
sense
of
blood
and
growth

seeks
nor

not

all

some

thy

less

come
forth

hours
the

shall

shall
be

song
love
laid
his

on

and
his
eyes
with
tears
were
red

pale
his

as
the
dead
and
fear
and
sorrow
and
scorn
kept
watch
by
his
head
forlorn
till
the
night
was
overworn
and
the
world
was
merry
with
morn
and
joy
came
up
with
the
day
and
kissed
love
lips
as
he
lay
and
the
watchers
ghostly
and
grey
sped
from
his
pillow
away
and
his
eyes
as
the
dawn
grew
bright
and
his
lips
waxed
ruddy
as
light
sorrow
may
reign
for
a
night
but
day
shall
bring
back
delight
a
vision
of
spring
in
winter
i
o
tender

thinks
long

with

footfall
sows
late
snowlike

the
snows

long
irresolute
to
be
o
where
have
they
hidden
thee
out
of

rose
i
reach
my
heart
out
toward
the
springtime
lands
i
stretch
my
spirit
forth
to
the
fair
hours
the
purplest
of
the
prime

lean
my
soul
down
over
them
with
hands
made
wide
to
take
the
ghostly
growths
of
flowers
i
send
my
love
back
to
the
lovely
time
ii
where
has
the
greenwood
hid
thy
gracious
head
veiled
with
what
visions
while
the
grey
world
grieves
or
muffled
with
what
shadows
of
green
leaves
what
warm
intangible
green
shadows
spread
to
sweeten
the
sweet
twilight
for
thy
bed
what
sleep
enchants
thee
what
delight
deceives
where
the
deep
dreamlike
dew
before
the
dawn
feels
not
the
fingers
of
the
sunlight
yet
its
silver
web
unweave
thy
footless
ghost
on
some
unfooted
lawn
whose
air
the
unrisen
sunbeams
fear
to
fret
lives
a
ghost
life
of
daylong
dawn

it
sees
not

where
the

are

soft

to

moves
with
the

gait
of
an
ungrown
moon

overhead

virginal

with

thee
away
down

that
called

that
were
raised

lured

thee

out

shadowy
lids
cover

mindless

played

one
with

not

leave

whose

flower

fruitless

encloses

thy
words

whose

is
in

thy
thoughts

that
takest

makest

strew
behind
thee

should
follow
finding
summer

thee

thee

wilt
make
no

take
no
gift

love
for
love
might

thee

that
bindest
eyes

worst

of

a

to

send
to

had
won
with

at
daybreak
when
the

claps

no

for

noble
heart
and
high
with
loud
glad
noise
he
stirs
himself

draws
nigh
such

the

that

profonde
tu
fais
à
tous
de

boire
à
ton

tout
ce
qui
pleure
et
se
dérobe
au

toutes
les
faims
et
tous
les
maux
du

moi
seul
je
veille
et
ne
vois
dans
ce
monde
que
ma
douleur
qui
point
de
séjour
où
sur
ta
rive
profonde
et
sous
tes
yeux
loin
du
jour
je
vais
toujours
cherchant
au
bord
de
le
sang
du
beau
pied
blessé
de
la
mer
est
sombre
où
tu
naquis
amour
pleine
des
pleurs
et
des
sanglots
du
monde
on
ne
voit
plus
le
gouffre
où
naît
le
jour
luire
et
frémir
sous
ta
lueur
profonde
mais
dans
les
coeurs
où
tu
fais
séjour
la
douleur
monte

baisse

il
semblait

des

que
sa
main
cueillît
comme
des
fleurs
écloses
les
étoiles
au

du

en

sa
parole
de

le
son
des

en

apollon
banni
des

roses
il
regardait
du

le
soleil
fut
pour
lui
le
soleil
du

monde
et
son
oeil
recherchait
dans
les
flots
embrasés
le
sillon
immortel
sur
vénus
que
la

molle
enivrait
de
baisers

courbés

la
splendeur
de
ta
face
austère

dore
la
nuit
de

longs
malheurs

dedication
some
nine
years
gone
as
we
dwelt
together
in
the
sweet
hushed
heat
of
the
south
french
weather
ere
autumn
fell
on
the
hills
or
the
season
had
shed
one
feather
friend
whose
fame
is
a
flame
that
fills
all
eyes
it
lightens
and
hearts
it
thrills
with
joy
to
be
born
of
the
blood
which
bred
from
a
land
that
the
grey
sea
girds
and
chills
the
heart
and
spirit
and
hand
and
head
whose
might
is
as
light
on
a
dark
day
shed
on
a
day
now
dark
as
a
land
decline
where
all
the
peers
of
your
praise
are
dead
in
a
land
and
season
of
corn
and
vine
i
pledged
you
a
health
from
a
beaker
of
mine
but
halfway
filled
to
the
lip
edge
yet
with
hope
for
honey
and
song
for
wine
nine
years
have
risen
and
eight
years
set
since
there
by
the
wellspring
our
hands
on
it
met
and
the
pledge
of
my
songs
that
were
then
to
be
i
could
wonder
not
friend
though
a
friend
should
forget
for
life
helm
rocks
to
the
windward
and
lee
and
time
is
as
wind
and
as
waves
are
we
and
song
is
as
foam
that
the
fret
though
the
thought
at
its
heart
should
be
deep
as
the
sea
