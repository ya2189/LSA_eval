uncle

on

drawn

john
a
poet
of
the
people
walt
mason
prose
rhymes
are
read
daily
by
approximately
ten
million
readers
a
newspaper
service
sells
these
rhymes
to
two
hundred
newspapers
with
a
combined
daily
circulation
of
nearly
five
million
and
assuming
that
five
people
read
each
newspaper
which
is
the
number
agreed
upon
by
publicity
experts
it
may
be
called
a
fair
guess
to
say
that
two
out
of
every
five
readers
of
newspapers
read
mason
poems
so
the
ten
million
daily
readers
is
a
reasonably
accurate
estimate
no
other
american
has
such
a
daily
audience
walt
mason
is
therefore
the
poet
laureate
of
the
american
democracy
he
is
the
voice
of
the
people
put
to
a
vote
walt
would
be
elected
to
the
laureate
job
if
he
got
a
vote
for
each
reader
and
generally
speaking
men
would
vote
as
they
read
the
reason
walt
mason
has
such
a
large
number
of
readers
is
because
he
says
what
the
average
man
is
thinking
so
that
the
average
man
can
understand
it
the
philosophy
of
walt
mason
is
the
philosophy
of
america
briefly
it
is
this
the
fiddler
must
be
paid
if
you
do
care
to
pay
do
dance
in
the
meantime
grin
and
bear
it
because
you
got
to
bear
it
and
you
might
as
well
grin
but
do
try
to
lie
out
of
it
the
lord
hates
a
cheerful
liar
this
is
what
the
american
likes
to
hear
for
that
is
the
american
idea
about
the
way
the
world
is
put
together
so
he
reads
walt
mason
night
and
morning
and
smiles
and
takes
his
knife
and
cuts
out
the
piece
and
carries
it
in
his
vest
pocket
or
her
handbag
it
will
interest
the
ten
million
readers
of
walt
mason
rhymes
to
know
that
they
are
written
in
emporia
kansas
in
the
office
of
the
emporia
gazette
after
mason
has
done
a
day
work
as
editorial
writer
and
telegraph
editor
of
an
afternoon
paper
the
rhymes
are
written
on
a
typewriter
as
rapidly
as
he
would
write
if
he
were
turning
out
prose
day

the

happy

days
that
long

had
an

we
no

these

at
charles

journey
to
the
block
as
he
paced
the
street
along
silence
fell
upon
the
throng
from
that
throng
there
burst
a
sigh
for
a
king
was
come
to
die
charles
upon
the
scaffold
stood
in
his
veins
no
craven
blood
calm
serene
he
viewed
the

while
the
headsman
said
aloud
cheer

our
motto
is
worth

not

therefore
let
us
both
be
gay

we
do
our
stunt

a
few
swift
whacks
do
not

the
kindly
song
minstrel
of
the
gentle
lay
when
the
night
is
dark
and
long
and
beset
with
thorns
the
way
in
the
poignant
hour
of
pain
in
this
weary
worldly
war
there
is
comfort
in
thy
strain
courage
in
excelsior
when
the
city
bends
us
down
with
its
weight
of
bricks
and
tiles
lead
us
poet
from
the
town
to
the
fragrant
forest
aisles
where
the
hemlocks
ever
moan
like
old
druids
clad
in
green
as
they
sighed
when
all
alone
wandered
sad
evangeline
writer
of
the
cleanly
page
teacher
of
the
golden
truth
still
i
love
thee
in
my
age
as
i
loved
thee
in
my
youth
in
some
breasts
a
fiercer
fire
flamed
than
ever
thou
hast
known
but
no
mortal
minstrel
lyre
ever
gave
a
purer
tone
singer
of
the
kindly
song
minstrel
of
the
gentle
lay
time
is
swift
and
art
is
long
and
thy
fame
will
last
alway
his
days
were
joyous
and
serene
his
life
was
pure
his
record
clean
folks
named
their
children
after
him
and
he
was
in
the
social
swim
ambitious
lads
would
say
i
plan
to
be
just
such
a
worthy
man
but
in
the
fullness
of
his
years
the
tempter
whispered
in
his
ears
and
begged
that
he
would
make
the
race
for
county
judge
or
some
such
place
and
so
he
yielded
to
his
fate
and
came
forth
as
a
candidate
the
night
before
election
day
they
found
him
lying
cold
and
gray
the
deadest
man
in
all
the
land
this
message
in
his
icy
hand
the
papers
that
opposed
my
race
have
brought
me
into
deep
disgrace
i
find
that
i
a
fiend
unloosed
i
robbed
a
widow
chicken
roost
and
stole
an
orphan
easter
egg
and
swiped
a
soldier
wooden
leg
i
bilked
a
heathen
of
his
joss
and
later
kidnapped
charlie
ross
i
learn
with
something
like
alarm
that
i
designed
the
gunness
farm
and
also
with
excessive
grief
that
black
hand
cohorts
call
me
chief
i
thought
myself
a
decent
man
whose
record
all
the
world
might
scan
but
now
alas
too
late
i
see
that
all
the
depths
of
infamy
have
soiled
me
with
their
reeking
shame
and
so
time
to
quit
the
game
human
the
greatest
gift
the
gods
bestowed
on
mortal
was
his
dome
of
thought
it
sometimes
seems
a
useless
load
when
one
is
tired
and
worn
and
hot
it
sometimes
seems
a
trifling
thing
less
useful
than
one
lungs
or
slats
a
mere
excuse
it
seems
to
bring
us
duns
from
men
who
deal
in
hats
some
men
appreciate
their
heads
and
use
them
wisely
every
day
and
every
passing
minute
sheds
new
splendor
on
their
upward
way
while
some
regard
their
heads
as
junk
mere
idle
knobs
upon
their
necks
such
men
are
nearly
always
sunk
in
failure
and
are
gloomy
wrecks
i
know
a
clerk
who
served
his
time
in
one
old
store
for
marked
his
fellows
climb
and
climb
and
marked
with
jealousy
and
tears
he
labored
there
since
he
was
young
he
labor
there
till
he
is
dead
he
never
rose
a
single
rung
because
he
never
used
his
head
i
know
a
poorhouse
in
the
vale
where
paupers
stay
they
paw
the
air
and
weep
and
wail
and
cuss
each
other
all
the
day
and
there
they
loll
while
life
endures
and
there
they
die
in
pauper
beds
their
chances
were
as
good
as
yours
but
then
they
never
used
their
heads
o
human
head
majestic
box
o
wondrous
can
from
labels
free
if
man
is
craving
fame
or
rocks
he
get
them
if
he
uses
thee
universal
my
cow
gone
dry
my
hens
wo
lay
my
horse
has
got
the
croup
the
hot
winds
spoiled
my
budding
hay
and
i
am
in
the
soup
and
while
my
life
is
sad
and
sore
and
earthly
joys
are
few
i
write
a
note
to
theodore
he
tell
me
what
to
do
i
was
home
when
fortune
called
my
feet
had
strayed
afar
i
fear
that
i
am
going
bald
and
i
have
got
catarrh
the
wolf
is
howling
at
my
door
i
naught
to
smoke
or
chew
but
i
shall
write
to
theodore
he
tell
me
what
to
do
my
sunday
suit
is
old
and
sere
i
wearing
last
year
lids
my
aunt
is
coming
for
a
year
to
visit
with
her
kids
they
will
not
trust
me
at
the
store
and
i
am
feeling
blue
so
i
shall
write
to
theodore
he
tell
me
what
to
do
when
we
are
weary
and
distraught
from
worldly
strife
and
care
and
we
denied
the
balm
we
sought
and
given
black
despair
ah
then
my
friends
there
is
one
chore
devolves
on
me
and
you
we
simply
write
to
theodore
he
tell
us
what
to
do
she
was
sweet
and
soft
and
clinging
and
he
always
found
her
singing
when
he
came
home
from
his
labors
as
the
night
was
closing
in
she
was
languishing
and
slender
and
her
eyes
were
deep
and
tender
and
he
simply
could
tell
her
that
her
coffee
was
a
sin
golden
hair
her
head
was
crowning
she
was
fond
of
quoting
browning
and
she
knew
a
hundred
legends
of
the
olden
golden
time
and
her
heart
was
full
of
yearning
for
the
rosicrucian
learning
and
he
simply
could
tell
her
that
the
beefsteak
was
a
crime
she
was
posted
on
pendennis
and
she
knew
the
songs
of
venice
and
he
listened
to
her
prattle
with
an
effort
to
look
pleased
and
she
liked
the
wit
of
weller
and
he
simply
could
tell
her
that
the
eggs
he
had
for
breakfast
had
been
laid
by
hens
diseased
so
she
filled
his
home
with
beauty
and
she
did
her
wifely
duty
did
it
as
she
understood
it
and
her
conscience
did
hurt
when
dyspepsia
boldly
sought
him
and
the
sexton
came
and
got
him
and
his
tortured
frame
was
buried
a
of
dirt
o
those
marriageable
misses
thinking
life
all
love
and
kisses
mist
and
moonshine
glint
and
glamour
stardust
borrowed
from
the
skies
man
a
gross
and
sordid
lummix
men
are
largely
made
of
stomachs
and
the
songs
of
all
the
sirens
will
not
take
the
place
of
pies
and
beautiful
it
floats
upon
the
summer
air
and
every
thread
of
it
denotes
the
love
that
woven
there
the
love
of
veterans
whose
tread
has
sounded
on
the
fields
of
red
and
women
old
who
mourn
their
dead
but
mourn
without
despair
and
beautiful
it
courts
caresses
of
the
breeze
and
straining
at
its
staff
it
sports
in
flaunting
ecstasies
and
other
flags
that
once
were
gay
long
long
ago
were
laid
away
and
many
men
whose
heads
are
gray
are
thinking
now
of
these
serene
and
beautiful
it
waves
the
flag
our
fathers
knew
in
freedom
sunny
air
it
laves
and
gains
a
brighter
hue
and
may
it
still
the
symbol
be
of
all
that
makes
a
nation
free
still
may
we
cherish
liberty
and
to
our
god
be
true
o
doc
i
cried
i
humbly
beg
that
you
will
amputate
my
leg
the
doctor
cheerfully
complied
and
shot
some
dope
into
my
hide
and
made
his
bucksaw
fairly
sail
until
it
struck
a
rusty
nail
hoot
mon
he
said
quite
undismayed
i
have
to
finish
with
a
spade
and
as
he
dug
and
toiled
away
we
talked
about
the
price
of
hay
the
recent
frightful
rise
in
pork
the
sugar
grafters
in
new
york
the
things
we
found
in
christmas
socks
the
flurry
in
rock
island
stocks
the
hookworm
and
the
hangman
noose
the
bright
career
of
captain
loose
i
felt
no
pain
or
ache
or
shock
it
pleased
me
much
to
watch
the
doc
and
when
the
job
was
done
i
said
now
that
you
here
cut
off
my
head
with
skillful
hands
he
wrought
and
wrought
and
soon
cut
off
my
dome
of
thought
and
when
i
asked
him
for
his
bill
there
is
no
charge
already
still
i
work
for
science
not
for
scads
so
keep
the
dollars
of
your
dads
to
banish
pain
is
my
desire
to
nothing
more
do
i
aspire
if
i
may
win
that
goal
you
bet
i
be
so
happy
always
yet
is
there
a
more
heroic
game
could
any
man
have
nobler
aim
one
poet
old
and
bald
and
fat
to
this
great
man
takes
off
his
hat
little
girl
so
glad
and
jolly
playing
with
your
dolly
built
of
rags
and
straw
fill
the
sunny
air
with
laughter
heedless
of
the
sorrow
after
that
is
childhood
law
let
no
sad
and
sordid
vision
cheat
you
of
the
joy
elysian
that
to
youth
belongs
let
no
prophecy
of
sorrow
scheduled
for
a
sad
tomorrow
still
your
joyous
songs
soon
enough
will
come
the
worry
and
the
labors
and
the
hurry
soon
you
cook
and
scrub
soon
with
milliners
and
drapers
you
will
fuss
and
read
long
papers
at
the
culture
club
lithe
your
form
but
soon
you
force
it
in
a
corset
that
will
make
you
bawl
and
those
little
feet
that
twinkle
you
will
squeeze
until
they
wrinkle
into
shoes
too
small
and
those
sunny
locks
so
tangled
will
be
tortured
and
kedangled
into
waves
and
curls
and
you
buy
complexion
powder
and
your
bonnets
will
be
louder
than
the
other
girl
little
girl
with
dolly
cut
out
woe
and
melancholy
jump
and
sing
and
play
fill
the
rippling
air
with
laughter
tears
and
corns
will
follow
after
this
is
childhood
day
i
run
a
hash
bazaar
just
up
the
street
there
all
my
boarders
are
yelling
for
meat
boarders
carniverous
boarders
herbiverous
allah

just
watch
them

yet
they

price

words

hairy
kurds

kind
of

their
words

chaucerous
dame
bring
us
rhinoceros
boiled
with
a
yam
i
run
a
boarding
booth
as
i
have
said
there
age
and
smiling
youth
raise
the
old
ned
maybe
the
clamoring
knocking
and
hammering
bunch
will
be
stammering
when
i
am
dead
at
that
hour
supremely
quiet
when
the
dusk
and
darkness
blend
and
the
sordid
strife
and
riot
of
the
day
are
at
an
end
when
the
bawling
and
the
screaming
of
the
mart
have
died
away
then
i
like
to
lie
of
my
castles
in
cathay
i
would
roam
in
flowery
spaces
watered
by
the
fabled
streams
i
would
travel
starry
spaces
on
the
winged
feet
of
dreams
i
would
float
across
the
ages
to
a
more
heroic
time
when
inspired
were
all
ages
and
the
warriors
sublime
at
that
hour
supremely
pleasing
dreams
are
all
knocked
galley
west
by
the
phonograph
wheezing
birdie
dear
i
love
you
best
and
the
king
sat
up
on
his
jeweled
throne
and
he
heaved
a
sigh
that
was
like
a
groan
for
his
crown
was
hard
and
it
bruised
his
head
and
his
scepter
weighed
like
a
pig
of
lead
the
ladies
smirked
as
they
came
to
beg
the
knights
were
pulling
the
royal
leg
the
king
exclaimed
if
i
had
my
wish
i
would
cut
this
out
and
i
go
and
fish
for
what
is
pomp
to
a
weary
soul
that
yearns
and
yearns
for
the
fishing
hole
the
throne
a
bore
and
the
crown
a
gawd
and
i
swap
the
lot
for
a
bamboo
rod
and
a
can
of
worms
and
a
piece
of
string
but
there
no
such
luck
for
a
poor
old
king
and
a
boy
who
passed
by
the
palace
high
to
fish
for
trout
in
the
streamlet
nigh
looked
up
in
awe
at
the
massive
walls
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
marble
halls
and
he
said
to
himself
oh
hully
chee
wisht
i
was
the
king
and
the
king
was
me
to
reign
all
day
with
your
crown
on
straight
is
a
whole
lot
diggin
bait
and
fishin
round
when
the
fish
wo
bite
and
gettin
licked
for
your
luck
at
night
little
green
the
little
green
tents
where
the
soldiers
sleep
and
the
sunbeams
play
and
the
women
weep
are
covered
with
flowers
today
and
between
the
tents
walk
the
weary
few
who
were
young
and
stalwart
in
when
they
went
to
the
war
away
the
little
green
tents
are
built
of
sod
and
they
are
not
long
and
they
are
not
broad
but
the
soldiers
have
lots
of
room
and
the
sod
is
part
of
the
land
they
saved
when
the
flag
of
the
enemy
darkly
waved
the
symbol
of
dole
and
doom
the
little
green
tent
is
a
thing
divine
the
little
green
tent
is
a
country
shrine
where
patriots
kneel
and
pray
and
the
brave
men
left
so
old
so
few
were
young
and
stalwart
in
when
they
went
to
the
war
away
illustration
judge
who
knows
the
hearts
of
men
may
find
a
desert
or
a
glen
for
souls
that
love
the
the
sod
is
the
dauntless
head
the
fierce
old
eyes
are
dim
and
dead
the
martial
heart
is
dust
they
say
he
died
in
sanctity
and
his
wild
soul
of
fetters
free
went
forth
to
join
the
just
but
will
the
joys
of
paradise
as
we
imagine
them
suffice
to
hold
geronimo
will
joyous
song
and
endless
calm
to
that
bold
spirit
be
a
balm
while
silent
eons
flow
but
heaven
is
a
region
fair
and
there
may
be
long
reaches
there
to
give
the
savage
space
to
ride
his
steed
field
and
fell
and
raise
his
fierce
defiant
yell
in
foray
and
in
race
the
judge
who
knows
the
hearts
of
men
may
find
a
desert
or
a
glen
for
souls
that
love
the
wild
and
through
the
gates
perchance
may
jog
the
hunter
pinto
and
his
dog
his
painted
squaw
and
child
venerable
you
say
your
grandma
dead
my
lad
and
you
bowed
down
with
woe
to
see
her
laid
beneath
the
mold
believe
you
ought
to
go
and
so
you
ask
a
half
day
off
and
you
may
have
that
same
alas
that
grannies
always
die
when
there
a
baseball
game
last
spring
if
i
remember
right
three
grandmas
died
for
you
and
you
bewailed
the
passing
then
of
souls
so
warm
and
true
and
then
another
grandma
died
a
tall
and
stately
dame
the
day
they
buried
her
there
was
a
game
and
when
the
balmy
breeze
of
june
among
the
willows
sighed
another
grandma
closed
her
eyes
and
crossed
the
great
divide
they
laid
her
gently
to
her
rest
beside
the
churchyard
wall
the
day
we
lammed
the
stuffing
from
the
rubes
from
minnepaul
go
forth
my
son
and
mourn
your
dead
and
shed
the
scalding
tear
and
lay
a
simple
wreath
upon
your
eighteenth
grandma
bier
while
you
perform
this
solemn
task
i
to
the
grandstand
go
and
watch
our
team
make
soupbones
of
the
foe
sing
a
song
of
long
ago
now
the
weary
day
is
done
and
the
breeze
is
sighing
low
dirges
for
the
vanished
sun
sing
a
song
of
other
days
ere
our
hearts
were
tired
and
old
sing
the
sweetest
of
old
lays
silver
threads
among
the
gold
we
who
feebly
hold
the
track
in
the
gloaming
of
life
day
love
the
songs
that
take
us
back
to
life
springtime
far
away
when
our
hope
had
airy
wing
and
our
hearts
were
strong
and
bold
and
at
eve
we
used
to
sing
silver
threads
among
the
gold
then
our
hair
no
silver
knew
and
these
eyes
that
shrunken
seem
were
the
brightest
brown
or
blue
and
old
age
was
but
a
dream
but
the
years
have
taken
flight
and
life
evening
bells
are
tolled
so
my
children
sing
tonight
silver
threads
among
the
gold
poet
if
old
jim
riley
came
to
town
to
read
a
bundle
of
his
rhyme
i
guess
you
could
hold
me
down
i
want
to
hear
him
every
time
i
heed
the
tempest
shriek
i
walk
ten
miles
and
not
complain
to
hear
jim
hoosier
riley
speak
but
i
would
not
go
round
a
block
to
see
a
statesman
saw
the
air
to
hear
a
hired
spellbinder
talk
like
a
faker
at
the
county
fair
for
statesmen
are
as
thick
as
fleas
and
poets
they
are
far
between
one
song
that
lingers
on
the
breeze
is
worth
a
million
yawps
i
ween
if
john
mccutcheon
came
to
town
to
make
some
pictures
on
the
wall
i
tear
the
whole
blamed
doorway
down
to
be
the
first
one
in
the
hall
you
could
keep
me
in
my
bed
if
i
was
dying
there
of
croup
the
push
would
find
me
at
the
head
of
the
procession
with
a
whoop
but
i
wo
push
my
fat
old
frame
across
a
dozen
yards
of
bricks
to
list
to
men
whose
only
fame
is
based
on
pull
and
politics
penny
it
is
wise
to
save
the
pennies
when
the
pennies
come
your
way
for
you
more
than
apt
to
need
them
when
arrives
the
rainy
day
and
when
famine
comes
with
the
on
her
vest
then
the
fellow
with
the
bundle
has
the
edge
on
all
the
rest
i
admire
the
man
who
saving
if
he
does
save
too
hard
if
he
does
think
a
dollar
bigger
than
the
courthouse
yard
and
i
like
to
see
him
salting
down
the
riches
that
he
struck
if
he
always
has
a
quarter
for
the
guy
out
of
luck
when
the
winter
comes
upon
us
yelling
like
a
baseball
fan
then
it
nice
to
have
some
boodle
in
an
old
tomato
can
when
sickness
in
the
wigwam
and
we
have
to
call
the
doc
then
it
nice
to
have
a
package
hidden
in
the
clock
when
old
age
the
hoary
rascal
comes
in
at
last
then
it
nice
to
have
some
rubles
that
you
cornered
in
the
past
and
the
man
who
saves
the
pennies
is
a
dandy
and
a
duck
if
he
always
has
a
quarter
for
the
guy
that
out
of
luck
now
the
nights
are
growing
longer
and
the
frost
is
in
the
air
and
nice
to
hug
the
fireside
in
your
trusty
rocking
chair
with
the
good
wife
there
beside
you
feeding
cookies
to
the
cat
while
the
energetic
children
play
the
dickens
with
your
hat
o
it
nice
to
look
around
you
and
to
feel
that
you
a
king
that
your
coming
home
at
evening
makes
your
joyous
subjects
sing
so
you
read
some
twenty
chapters
of
old
gibbon
dope
on
rome
and
you
know
what
human
bliss
is
in
your
humble
little
home
there
is
really
nothing
better
in
the
way
of
earthly
bliss
than
to
toddle
home
at
evening
and
to
get
a
welcome
kiss
and
to
know
the
kids
who
greet
you
at
the
garden
gate
have
been
wailing
that
you
were
two
minutes
late
there
is
nothing
much
more
soothing
than
a
loving
woman
smile
when
she
sees
your
climbing
the
bargain
counter
stile
if
you
do
appreciate
it
then
the
bats
are
in
your
dome
for
the
greatest
king
is
the
monarch
of
a
home
and
the
eagle
ought
to
have
a
place
among
the
false
alarms
we
place
its
picture
on
our
coins
and
on
our
coat
of
arms
but
what
did
eagles
ever
do
but
frolic
in
the
sun
they
be
in
jail
for
larceny
if
justice
should
be
done
they
are
not
half
so
good
to
eat
as
mallard
duck
or
grouse
they
surely
cause
a
panic
in
a
section
boarding
house
and
never
in
this
weary
world
was
farmer
seen
to
go
to
trade
a
pail
of
eagle
eggs
for
nails
or
calico
the
humble
hen
on
hand
still
helps
the
world
along
she
lifts
the
farmer
mortgage
as
she
trills
her
morning
song
she
yields
the
fragrant
omelet
and
when
reduced
to
pie
she
makes
the
boarder
feel
that
he
at
last
is
fit
to
die
the
eagle
does
not
stir
the
souls
of
earnest
thoughtful
men
and
so
let
take
him
from
the
shield
and
substitute
the
hen
sunday
i
spent
five
cents
for
the
sunday
dart
and
hauled
it
home
in
a
cart
i
piled
the
sections
upon
the
floor
till
they
reached
as
high
as
the
kitchen
door
i
hung
the
chromos
upon
the
wall
though
there
was
room
to
hang
them
all
and
the
yard
was
littered
some
ten
feet
deep
with
comic
sections
that
made
me
weep
and
there
were
sections
of
pink
and
green
a
woman
section
and
magazine
and
sheets
of
music
the
which
if
played
would
quickly
make
an
audience
fade
and
there
were
patterns
for
women
gowns
and
also
for
and
a
false
mustache
and
a
rubber
doll
and
a
deck
of
cards
and
a
parasol
now
men
are
busy
with
dray
and
cart
away
the
sunday
dart
nation
the
nation
sliding
down
the
path
that
leads
to
ruin
lair
and
all
of
ruin
dogs
of
wrath
will
chew
its
vitals
there
each
day
we
deeper
plunge
in
grief
we
soon
have
reached
the
worst
why
do
we
turn
then
for
relief
to
william
randolph
hurst
it
seems
we
have
any
sense
that
we
these
ills
endure
he
told
us
oft
in
confidence
that
he
alone
is
pure
he
is
the
bulwark
of
our
hope
our
last
shield
and
our
first
then
let
rely
upon
the
dope
of
william
randolph
hurst
he
offers
us
the
helping
hand
he
fain
would
be
our
guide
and
still
we
wreck
this
blooming
land
and
let
all
virtue
slide
of
all
that
is
the
country
best
we
making
wienerwurst
o
let
us
lean
upon
the
breast
of
william
randolph
hurst
he
stands
and
waits
serene
sublime
he
beckons
and
he
sings
he
wears
a
halo
all
the
time
and
he
is
growing
wings
so
let
us
quit
the
course
that
harms
forsake
the
things
accurst
and
rest
like
children
in
the
arms
of
william
randolph
hurst
the
game
was
ended
and
the
noise
at
last
had
died
away
and
now
they
gathered
up
the
boys
where
they
in
pieces
lay
and
one
was
hammered
in
the
ground
by
many
a
jolt
and
jar
some
fragments
never
have
been
found
they
flew
away
so
far
they
found
a
stack
of
tawny
hair
some
fourteen
cubits
high
it
was
the
lying
there
where
he
had
crawled
to
die
they
placed
the
pieces
on
a
door
and
from
the
crimson
field
that
hero
then
they
gently
bore
like
soldier
on
his
shield
the
surgeon
toiled
the
livelong
night
above
the
gory
wreck
he
got
the
ribs
adjusted
right
the
wishbone
and
the
neck
he
soldered
on
the
ears
and
toes
and
got
the
spine
in
place
and
fixed
a
nose
upon
the
mangled
face
and
then
he
washed
his
hands
and
said
i
glad
that
task
is
done
the
raised
his
fractured
head
and
cried
i
call
this
fun
the
doctor
is
sure
that
my
health
is
poor
he
says
that
i
waste
away
so
bring
me
a
can
of
the
shredded
bran
and
a
bale
of
the
toasted
hay
o
feed
me
on
rice
and
denatured
ice
and
the
oats
that
the
horses
chew
and
a
peck
of
slaw
and
a
load
of
straw
and
a
turnip
and
squash
or
two
the
doctor
cries
that
it
wo
be
wise
to
eat
of
the
things
i
like
if
i
make
a
break
at
a
sirloin
steak
my
stomach
is
sure
to
strike
i
dare
not
reach
for
the
luscious
peach
or
stab
at
the
lemon
pie
if
i
make
a
pass
at
the
stew
alas
i
sure
to
curl
up
and
die
if
a
thing
looks
good
it
must
be
eschewed
if
bad
i
may
eat
it
down
so
bring
me
a
jar
of
the
rich
pine
tar
from
the
health
food
works
up
town
and
bring
me
a
bag
of
your
basic
slag
and
a
sack
of
your
bolted
prunes
and
a
bowl
of
slop
from
the
doctor
shop
and
ladle
it
in
with
spoons
i
will
have
to
feed
on
the
jimson
weed
and
the
grass
that
the
cows
may
leave
for
the
doctor
sure
that
my
health
is
poor
and
i
know
that
he
not
deceive
illustration
it
may
be
all
right
for
a
woman
so
old
to
leap
the
table
and
my
grandmother
suffered
and
languished
in
pain
till
she
read
in
a
magazine
ad
that
a
woman
should
put
on
a
sweater
and
train
and
help
the
delsartean
fad
and
now
when
i
go
to
my
midday
repast
no
meal
is
made
ready
for
me
my
grandmother
climbing
a
mast
or
shinning
up
into
a
tree
the
house
has
a
stairway
that
she
will
not
use
she
always
slides
down
on
the
rail
she
spoiled
all
the
floors
with
her
spiked
sprinting
shoes
and
she
laughs
when
i
put
up
a
wail
o
it
may
be
all
right
for
a
woman
so
old
to
leap
the
table
and
chairs
while
i
try
to
fill
up
on
the
grub
that
is
cold
with
the
dishes
all
piled
on
the
stairs
today
i
protested
with
many
a
tear
made
a
moan
like
a
maundering
dunce
and
she
kicked
all
the
lights
from
the
brass
chandelier
and
turned
forty
handsprings
at
once
i
told
her
i
never
could
prosper
and
thrive
on
victuals
unfit
for
a
man
she
offered
to
throw
me
three
falls
out
of
five
or
nine
nine
monarchs
followed
in
the
gloom
when
edward
journeyed
to
the
tomb
nine
monarchs
walked
as
in
a
dream
enough
to
make
a
baseball
team
and
cast
upon
king
edward
bier
the
futile
tribute
of
a
tear
and
at
his
task
the
sexton
sings
the
man
who
digs
the
graves
for
kings
nine
monarchs
in
their
brave
array
are
bending
over
edward
clay
and
does
the
silent
sovereign
care
or
does
he
know
that
they
are
there
and
can
the
tears
of
monarchs
nine
make
those
dim
eyes
of
edward
shine
and
if
they
give
their
nine
commands
can
they
bring
life
to
those
cold
hands
can
all
their
armies
and
their
ships
bring
laughter
to
those
dead
white
lips
can
their
nine
crowns
and
sceptres
nine
bring
to
the
dead
the
life
divine
nine
paupers
at
a
pauper
grave
who
claw
their
rags
and
weep
and
rave
can
do
as
much
to
help
the
dead
as
those
nine
kings
at
edward
bed
eyes
of
sad
eyes
that
were
patient
and
tender
sad
eyes
that
were
steadfast
and
true
and
warm
with
the
unchanging
splendor
of
courage
no
ills
could
subdue
eyes
dark
with
the
dread
of
the
morrow
and
woe
for
the
day
that
was
gone
the
sleepless
companions
of
sorrow
the
watchers
that
witnessed
the
dawn
eyes
tired
from
the
clamor
and
goading
and
dim
from
the
stress
of
the
years
and
hollowed
by
pain
and
foreboding
and
strained
by
repression
of
tears
sad
eyes
that
were
wearied
and
blighted
by
visions
of
sieges
and
wars
now
watch
a
country
united
from
the
luminous
slopes
of
the
stars
better
there
is
a
better
world
they
say
where
tears
and
woe
are
done
away
there
shining
hosts
in
fields
sublime
are
playing
baseball
all
the
time
and
there
where
no
one
ever
sins
the
home
team
nearly
always
wins
upon
that
bright
and
sunny
shore
we
never
need
to
sorrow
more
no
umpires
on
the
field
are
slain
no
games
are
called
because
of
rain
so
let
us
live
that
we
may
fly
on
snowy
pinions
when
we
die
to
where
the
pitcher
never
falls
or
gives
a
man
first
base
on
balls
where
do
adorn
the
score
and
shortstops
fumble
never
more
is
one
day
a
farmer
found
a
bone
he
thought
at
first
it
was
a
stone
and
threw
it
at
a
passing
snake
ere
he
discovered
his
mistake
but
when
he
knew
it
was
a
bone
and
not
a
diamond
or
a
stone
he
took
it
to
an
ancient
sage
who
said
in
prehistoric
age
this
was
the
of
a
the
farmer
cried
dad
bing
my
eyes
was
ever
man
so
wondrous
wise
he
gazes
on
a
piece
of
bone
that
i
supposed
to
be
a
stone
and
with
a
confidence
sublime
he
looks
across
the
void
of
time
and
gives
this
fossil
bone
a
name
the
fragment
of
some
creature
frame
to
have
such
knowledge
sir
as
thine
i
give
those
fertile
farms
of
mine
envy
me
the
sage
replied
and
shook
his
weary
head
and
sighed
your
life
to
me
seems
full
and
sweet
you
always
have
enough
to
eat
pie
a
sport
in
new
jersey
whose
name
is
mislaid
has
issued
a
challenge
serene
undismayed
he
claims
he
can
shovel
more
pies
in
his
hold
than
any
man
living
and
puts
up
the
gold
to
back
up
his
challenge
so
here
is
a
chance
for
pie
eating
experts
their
fame
to
advance
now
here
is
a
sport
that
i
like
to
indorse
a
man
can
eat
pies
and
not
work
like
a
horse
no
training
for
wearisome
weeks
no
sparring
or
wrestling
with
subsidized
freaks
no
rubbing
or
grooming
or
skipping
the
rope
no
toning
your
nerves
with
some
horse
doctor
dope
no
bones
dislocated
or
face
pounded
sore
no
wearing
gum
boots
in
a
whirlpool
of
gore
the
pie
eater
training
no
anguish
implies
he
starves
till
his
stomach
is
howling
for
pies
he
loosens
his
belt
to
the
uttermost
hole
and
says
to
the
umpire
all
right
let
her
roll
there
gold
for
the
winner
and
honor
and
fame
and
even
the
loser
ahead
of
the
game
sexton
only
a
little
longer
and
the
journey
is
done
my
friend
only
a
little
further
and
the
road
will
have
an
end
the
shadows
begin
to
lengthen
the
evening
soon
will
close
and
it
ho
for
the
inn
of
the
sexton
the
inn
where
we
all
repose
the
inn
has
no
bridal
chamber
no
suites
for
the
famed
or
great
the
guests
when
they
go
to
slumber
are
all
of
the
same
estate
the
chambers
are
small
and
narrow
the
couches
are
hard
and
cold
and
the
grinning
fleshless
landlord
is
not
to
be
bribed
with
gold
a
sheet
for
the
proud
and
haughty
a
sheet
for
the
beggar
guest
a
sheet
for
the
blooming
maiden
a
sheet
for
us
all
and
rest
no
bells
at
the
dawn
of
morning
no
rap
at
the
chamber
door
but
silence
is
there
and
slumber
for
ever
and
ever
more
then
ho
for
the
inn
of
the
sexton
the
inn
where
we
all
must
sleep
when
our
hands
are
done
with
their
toiling
and
our
eyes
have
ceased
to
weep
who
the
merchant
said
in
caustic
tones
james
henry
charles
augustus

please
get
your
pay
and
leave
the
store
i
will
not
need
you
any
more
important
chores
you
seem
to
shun
you
always
leaving
work
undone
and
when
i
ask
the
reason
why
you
heave
a
sad
and
soulful
sigh
and
idly
scratch
your
dome
of
thought
and
feebly
say
oh
i
forgot
james
henry
charles
augustus
jones
this
world
a
poor
resort
for
drones
for
men
with
heads
so
badly
set
that
their
long
suit
is
to
forget
no
man
will
ever
write
his
name
upon
the
shining
wall
of
fame
or
soar
aloft
on
glowing
wings
because
he
ca
remember
things
noticed
that
such
chaps
as
you
remember
when
your
pay
is
due
and
when
the
noontime
whistles
throb
your
memory
is
on
the
job
and
when
a
holiday
at
hand
your
recollection
is
canned
the
failures
on
life
busy
way
the
paupers
friendless
wan
and
gray
throughout
their
bootless
days
like
you
forgot
the
things
they
ought
to
do

your
coat
and

your
bones

for

resting
he
is
sitting
tired
and
sore
with
his
feet
upon
the
table
and
his
hat
upon
the
floor
he
is
wearied
and
exhausted
by
the
labors
of
the
day
he
has
talked
about
the
tariff
since
the
dawn
was
cold
and
gray
he
has
lost
eight
games
of
checkers
for
his
luck
today
was
mean
and
that
luck
was
still
against
him
when
he
bucked
the
slot
machine
so
his
nerves
are
under
tension
and
his
brow
is
dark
with
care
and
the

laid
upon

great
for

to
bear

children
for
your

tired

sore
and
he
seems
to
think
the
ceiling
is
some
kind
of
cuspidor
oh
he
broken
down
and
beaten
by
the
long
and
busy
day
he
been
sitting
in
the
feedstore
on
a
bale
of
prairie
hay
telling
how
the
hungry
grafters
have
the
country
by
the
throat
how
the
tariff
on
dried
apples
robs
the
poor
man
of
his
coat
how
this
nasty
polar
rumpus
might
be
settled
once
for
all
and
his
feet
are
on
the
table
and
his
back
against
the
wall
let
him
find
his
home
a
quiet
and
a
nest
for
the
worn
and
weary
and
his
spirit
longs
for
rest
idle
i
tired
of
the
bootless
questions
that
rise
in
my
vagrant
mind
i
gaze
at
the
stars
and
wonder
how
many
may
be
behind
a
myriad
worlds
are
whirling
concealed
by
the
nearer
spheres
and
there
they
have
coursed
their
orbits
a
million
million
years
i
gaze
at
the
spangled
spaces
the
bed
of
a
billion
stars
from
the
luminous
veil
of
venus
to
the
militant
glare
of
mars
and
wonder
when
all
is
ended
as
ended
all
things
must
be
if
the
captain
will
then
remember
a
poor
little
soul
like
me
tired
of
the
endless
questions
that
come
and
will
not
begone
when
i
face
to
the
east
and
witness
the
miracle
of
the
dawn
the
march
of
the
shining
coursers
forest
and
sea
and
land
the
splendor
of
gorgeous
colors
applied
by
the
captain
hand
the
parting
of
crimson
curtains
afar
in
the
azure
steep
the
hush
of
a
wonder
when
even
the
zephyrs
sleep
and
i
look
on
the
birth
of
morning
as
millions
have
gazed
before
and
question
the
wave
that
questions
the
rocks
and
the
sandy
shore
when
all
of
these
things
are
ended
as
ended
these
things
must
be
will
the
captain
of
all
remember
a
poor
little
soul
like
me
in
my
youth
i
knew
an
aleck
who
was
most
exceeding
smart
and
his
flippant
way
of
talking
often
broke
the
hearer
heart
he
was
working
for
a
grocer
in
a
little
corner
store
taking
down
the
wooden
shutters
sweeping
up
the
greasy
floor
and
he
always
answered
pertly
and
he
had
a
sassy
eye
and
the
people
often
asked
him
if
he
would
kindly
die
oh
the
festive
years
skedaddled
and
the
children
of
that
day
now
are
bent
beneath
life
burdens
and
their
hair
is
turning
gray
and
the
flippant
one
is
toiling
in
the
same
old
corner
store
taking
down
the
ancient
shutters
sweeping
up
the
greasy
floor
in
the
same
old
sleepy
village
lived
a
springald
so
polite
that
to
hear
him
answer
questions
was
a
genuine
delight
he
was
working
in
a
foundry
where
they
dealt
in
eggs
and
cheese
and
the
work
was
hard
and
tiresome
but
he
always
tried
to
please
and
today
he
boss
of
thousands
and
his
salary
sky
high
and
his
manner
just
as
pleasant
as
it
was
in
days
gone
by
an
idle
trifling
story
and
you
doubtless
think
it
flat
but
its
moral
might
be
pasted
with
some
profit
in
your
hat
illustration
are
weary
little
pilgrims
straying
in
a
world
of
we
are
weary
little
pilgrims
straying
in
a
world
of
gloom
just
behind
us
is
the
cradle
just
before
us
is
the
tomb
there
is
nothing
much
to
guide
us
or
the
proper
path
to
mark
as
we
toddle
on
our
journey
little
pilgrims
in
the
dark
and
we
jostle
and
we
struggle
in
our
feeble
futile
wrath
always
striving
always
reaching
to
push
others
from
the
path
and
the
wrangling
and
the
jangling
of
our
peevish
voices
rise
to
the
seraphim
that
watch
us
through
the
starholes
in
the
skies
and
they
say
the
foolish
pilgrims
watch
them
as
they
push
and
shove
they
might
have
a
pleasant
ramble
if
their
hearts
were
full
of
love
if
they
help
and
cheer
each
other
from
the
hour
that
they
embark
but
they
only
blind
and
erring
little
pilgrims
in
the
dark
wooden
a
poor
old
wooden
indian
all
battered
by
the
years
was
seated
on
a
pile
of
junk
and
shedding
briny
tears
what
hurts
you
asked
the
teddy
bear
why
are
you
thus
distressed
why
do
you
tear
your
willow
hair
and
smite
your
basswood
breast
alas
my
occupation
gone

now
refuse
to

i
used
to
stand
in

pride
before

times
have
changed
and
those
glad
days
will
come
to
me
no
more

here
among
the

in
mournful
solitude

some

breaks
me
into

up

at

the

it
would
truly
be
sublime

than
if
you
help
a
busted
pilgrim
who

luck
a
while
if
you
stake
him
with
a
dollar
and

features
light
up

a
glow
of
joy

you
hear

fellow
far
away
who
so
weary

so
homesick
that
his
hair
is
turning
gray
he
will
feel
a
whole
lot
better
and
the
smile
will
come
and
he
sail
into
his
duties
in
a
way
to
make
things
hum
then
done
a
thing
to
help
you
when
peter
calls
your

there
are
better
things
than

man
to

ground
he
lost
some
one
who
been
up
against

tempest
tossed
and
you
turn
around
and
help
him
to
his
place
with
other
men
crying
shame
upon
the
knockers
who
would
drag
him
down
again
then
you

that
you
a
critter
of
a
princely
strain
of
blood
there
are
better
things
than
boodle
on
this
little
ball
of
mud
famous
john
and
peter
and
robert
and
paul
what
in
the
world
has
become
of
them
all
how
are
they
stacking
and
where
are
they
gone
paul
and
robert
and
peter
and
john
paul
was
a
poet
and
labored
and
wrought
over
his
harp
and
he
kept
its
strings
hot
haunting
and
sad
was
his
music
though
sweet
bards
ca
be
glad
when
they
nothing
to
eat
peter
made
pictures
and
painted
them
well
was
his
fault
that
they
never
would
sell
was
his
fault
that
he
took
a
brief
ride
out
to
the
poorhouse
where
later
he
died
robert
taught
school
till
he
died
of
old
age
hard
were
his
labors
and
scanty
his
wage
we
laid
him
to
rest
in
a
grave
on
the
hill
the
county
was
called
on
to
settle
the
bill
john
was
a
pitcher
whose
curves
were
immense
he
was
the
pet
of
the
bleachers
and
hence
he
was
the
owner
of
riches
untold
diamonds
and
rubies
and
sapphires
and
gold
john
and
peter
and
robert
and
paul
through
the
long
years
we
kept
cases
on
all
i
gazed
upon
that
mighty
flood
that
writhed
as
though
in
pain
or
woe
and
fell
with
dull
and
thud
into
the
chasm
far
below
if
there
a
man
with
soul
so
dead
that
he
unmoved
can
view
that
scene
he
surely
has
a
basswood
head
and
had
it
carved
when
it
was
green
o
noble
falls
stupendous
sight
dame
nature
most
emphatic
fact
the
gods
were
on
their
job
all
right
when
they
designed
that
cataract
all
other
wonders
are
a
dream
a
foolish
feeble
phantasy
the
pauper
falls
of
europe
seem
absurd
when
they
compared
with
thee
had
i
but
seen
thee
in
thy
prime
when
this
proud
nation
had
its
dawn
in
that
fair
distant
golden
time
before
they
strapped
thy
harness
on
then
i
have
written
thee
an
ode
to
make
thy
waters
pause
a
while
but
go
and
drag
along
thy
load
since
beasts
of
burden
are
in
style
alas
that
two
such
handsome
falls
that
should
be
kicking
up
their
heels
come
forth
like
horses
from
their
stalls
to
turn
a
million
greasy
wheels
to
grind
up
glue
make
lightning
rods
and
furnish
cheap
electric
light
no
wonder
that
the
nine
great
gods
look
down
in
anger
at
the
sight
rainy
i
hear
the
plashing
of
the
rain
upon
the
roof
upon
the
pane
it
murmurs
at
the
door
it
patters
forth
a
futile
boast
it
whispers
like
a
timid
ghost
it
streams
upon
the
floor
and
as
i
sit
me
here
alone
and
listen
to
its
monotone
strange
fancies
come
and
go
i
seem
to
see
distinct
and
plain
dim
faces
drawn
upon
the
pane
of
friends
i
used
to
know
soft
voices
whisper
in
the
rain
and
friends
i
shall
see
again
are
crying
bitterly
the
raindrops
seem
to
be
their
tears
and
the
misty
void
of
years
they
calling
calling
me
o
shadows
from
a
starless
shore
begone
and
torture
me
no
more
and
leave
me
here
alone
i
fear
the
voices
in
the
rain
the
voices
vibrant
with
their
pain
i
fear
the
spectres
that
complain
in
weary
monotone
but
still
they
chide
me
at
the
door
and
whisper
there
for
evermore
and
murmur
in
their
woe
i
hear
them
in
the
tempest
swell
i
hear
them
sigh
i
hear
them
yell
where
is
that
old
green
umberell
you
swiped
two
years
ago
every
day
we
read
the
story
of
some
vessel
which
sends
forth
a
wireless
message
and
would
otherwise
be
lost
it
would
join
the
ghostly
squadrons
in
the
realm
beneath
the
wave
were
it
not
for
modern
science
which
can
rob
the
ocean
grave
vainly
of
such
mighty
marvels
all
in
vain
the
poet
sings
they
would
need
another
homer
and
a
harp
with
strings
we
can
only
pause
in
wonder
as
we
read
these
thrilling
tales
of
the
mystic
spark
that
carries
news
of
shipwreck
through
the
gales
we
can
only
take
our
lids
off
to
the
noble
master
mind
that
achieved
this
latest
triumph
over
fog
and
wave
and
wind
yet
to
show
appreciation
we
might
buy
some
shares
of
stock
in
the
wireless
corporation
office
just
around
the
block
with
each
share
we
get
a
picture
of
a
hero
maybe
twins
and
in
time
in
every
parlor
there
will
hang
a
johnnie
binns
there
will
be
so
many
binnses
coming
from
the
rescued
ships
that
they
form
a
secret
order
with
its
passwords
signs
and
grips
i
owe
so
much
to
bok
that
language
fails
me
when
i
try
about
his
kindnesses
to
talk
and
briny
tears
bedim
my
eye
i
owe
it
to
that
gifted
man
that
i
can
take
ten
yards
of
string
and
decorate
a
frying
pan
until
it
is
a
beauteous
thing
he
taught
me
how
to
paint
a
brick
and
hang
it
on
the
parlor
wall
which
made
the
blamed
room
look
so
slick
that
callers
cry
it
does
beat
all
was
bok
who
taught
me
how
to
tie
pink
ribbons
on
my
corns
and
when
i
bought
a
muley
cow
he
showed
me
how
to
gild
her
horns
i
made
a
cupboard
from
a
trunk
directed
by
his
kindly
charts
a
of
junk
to
my
poor
home
a
charm
imparts
when
arctic
stories
stirred
the
soul
his
enterprise
was
just
immense
he
showed
me
how
to
make
a
pole
complete
for
cents
and
when
tumbo
sailed
away
among
the
roaring
beasts
to
rush
bok
pictured
in
his
a
jungle
made
of
yellow
plush
and
when
i
face
the
tyrant
death
may
bok
be
with
me
in
the
gloom
to
decorate
my
final
breath
with
tassels
and
an
ostrich
plume
she
is
a
vain
and
foolish
lass
she
stands
before
her
and
fusses
with
her
pins
and
rats
and
tries
on
half
a
dozen
hats
and
fixes
doodads
in
her
hair
and
tints
her
cheeks
already
fair
and
when
fooled
three
hours
away
and
she
appears
in
glad
array
she
is
half
as
nice
and
neat
she
is
half
as
slick
and
sweet
as
she
appeared
four
hours
ago
when
she
was
wearing
calico
if
she
would
take
the
time
she
fools
away
with
paints
and
curling
tools
and
read
some
books
of
prose
or
rhyme
she
get
some
value
for
her
time
she
pads
her
head
outside
with
rats
machine
made
hair
and
monster
hats
and
gladness
might
with
her
abide
if
she
would
pad
her
head
inside
for
beauty
is
a
transient
thing
the
hurried
years
are
on
the
wing
the
dazzling
maiden
of
today
will
soon
be
haggard
worn
and
gray
and
in
life
winter
when
she
sits
beside
her
lonely
hearth
and
knits
it
will
not
lessen
her
despair
to
think
of
rats
she
used
to
wear
but
if
her
mind
is
stored
with
gold
from
books
the
sages
wrote
of
old
with
ancient
lore
or
modern
song
the
days
will
not
seem
drear
and
long
life
twilight
will
be
calm
and
fair
and
loneliness
will
not
be
there
illustration
do
not
count
for
much
with
people
when
you
are
dead
my
weary
friend
and
some
day
you
must
die
the
crowds
will
stand
along
the
curb
to
see
the
hearse
go
by
and
at
the
church
the
folks
will
stand
and
raise
a
mournful
din
and
pile
a
lot
of
roses
on
the
box
that
you
are
in
and
people
then
will
shake
their
heads
and
say
it
is
a
shame
that
such
a
honeybird
as
you
should
have
to
quit
the
game
and
when
beneath
the
sod
you
rest
in
your
mail
order
gown
you
have
a
big
fat
monument
that
sure
to
hold
you
down
but
little
will
it
all
avail
for
you
be
sleeping
sound
and
honors
do
not
count
for
much
with
people
underground
you
rather
have
some
kindness
while
you
tread
this
vale
of
tears
than
have
your
dust
lamented
for
fifty
million
years
a

mother
tired
with
aching

from
sweeping
floors
and
baking
bread
called
to
her
daughter

wish
you
help
a
little
here
fair
susan
in
the
parlor

was
playing
a
tender
hymn
methinks
it
was
the
maiden
prayer
a
melody
beyond
compare
she
cried
while
playing
on
in
style
i
help
you
in
a
little
while
her
lover
blew
in
unawares
a
fine
young
man
with
princely
airs
his
heart
was
free
from
sordid
stains
his
head
was
full
of
brains
most
any
girl
would
give
her
eyes
to
gather
in
so
big
a
prize
he
heard
the
mother
weary
cry
he
heard
the
damsel
flip
reply
his
bosom
swelled
with
noble
ire
his
tawny
eyes
flashed
streaks
of
fire

cried

me

turn
you
down

comets
shine

no
blushing
bride
of
mine
the
healthy
girl
who
does
jump
and
on
her
system
get
a
hump
when
mother
calls
i
do
not
want
so
get
thee
hence

passes
up

when
she
has
got
a
chance
to
chase
the
troubles
from
her

good
it
a
pretty
good
scheme

be
cheery
and

as
you
follow
the
road
for
a
good
many
pilgrims
are
weary
and
hopelessly
carry
the
load
their
hearts
from
the
journey
are
breaking
and
a
rod
seems
to
them
like
a
mile
and
it
may
be
the
noise
you
are
making
will
hearten
them
up
for
a
while
it
a
pretty
good
scheme
in
your
joking

cut
out
the
jest
that
unkind
for
the
barbed
kind
of
fun
you
are
poking

fellow

a

hearts
have
been
broken
a

many
hearts
fond
and
true
by
words
that
were
carelessly
spoken
by
alecky
fellows
like
you
it
a
pretty
good
scheme
to
be
doing
some
choring
around
while
you
can
for
the
gods
with
their
gifts
are
pursuing
the
earnest
industrious
man
and
those
gods
in
their
own
el
dorado
are
laying
up
wrath
for
the
one
who
loafs
all
the
day
in
the
shadow
while
others
toil
out
in
the
sun
by
when
i
was
young
and
fresh
and
ruddy
and
full
of
snap
and
vim
my
parents
used
to
make
me
study
until
my
head
would
swim
i
sat
upon
the
schoolhouse
bleachers
with
pencil
book
and
slate
while
sundry
bald
and
weary
teachers
drilled
knowledge
through
my
pate
for
some
quick
method
i
was
yearning
some
easy
path
to
tread
there
is
no
royal
road
to
learning
the
bald
old
teachers
said
stick
closely
to
the
printed
pages
all
idleness
eschew
and
then
perhaps
in
future
ages
know
a
thing
or
two
and
when
i
left
the
school
and
college
to
climb
life
toilsome
hill
i
found
my
little
store
of
knowledge
would
barely
fill
the
bill
but
nowadays
the
world
moves
quicker
than
in
the
long
ago
methods
make
us
snicker
they
were
so
crude
and
slow
by
sending
seven
wooden
dollars
to
freaks
and
freaks
make
our
children
finished
scholars
and
do
it
in
three
weeks
so
let
us
close
the
schools
and
leave
to
ruin
and
decay
and
take
the
books
and
maps
and
heave
a
million
miles
away
for
now
the
kids
take
erudition

abroad

caught

ease
who
has
a
standard

she
build
again
his
stately
halls
and

up
his

years

with

her
in

her
up
with
stony
stare

its
course

samantha
cousin
mary
ann
has
hooked
up
with
the
plumber
man
a
gent
of
industry
and
peace
whose
face
is
often
black
with
grease
they
dwell
together
in
a
cot
surrounded
by
a
garden
plot
and
there
she
raises
beans
and
tripe
while
he
is
fixing
valve
and
pipe
he
takes
his
money
like
a
man
and
hands
it
to
mary
ann
and
she
is
salting
down
his
wage
where
it
will
help
them
in
old
age
o
reader
who
has
made
a
fluke
samantha
with
her
pallid
duke
or
fat
and
sassy
mary
ann
who
gathered
in
the
plumber
man
there
the
man
whose
hand
is
clammy
as
a
fish
that
lately
died
and
to
grasp
it
sends
a
shudder
percolating
through
your
hide
and
you
feel
its
cold
impression
in
your
muscles
and
your
glands
and
you
wish
he
wear
an
oven
on
his
blamed
antarctic
hands
there
the
man
with
hands
so
horny
that
they
feel
like
chunks
of
slate
and
when
he
is
shaking
with
you
you
can
feel
them
grind
and
grate
and
he
nearly
breaks
your
fingers
and
you
mutter
through
your
hat
i
would
run
them
through
a
smelter
if
my
hands
were
hard
as
that
there
the
man
whose
hands
are
always
pawing
pawing
while
he
talks
they
are
fussing
with
your
whiskers
they
are
reaching
for
your
socks
they
are
patting
on
your
bosom
they
are
clawing
on
your
arm
and
you
like
to
meet
their
owner
on
the
gunness
farm
there
the
man
whose
hands
are
always
sliding
down
into
his
jeans
to
relieve
some
broken
pilgrims
of
their
miseries
and
pains
and
such
hands
that
in
their
giving
never
falter
never
tire
in
the
golden
time
will
be
twanging
at
a
lyre
lost
upon
the
joyous
new
year
day
i
threw
my
briar
pipe
away
i
said
with
conscious
rectitude
the
smoking
habit
base
and
lewd
it
taints
the
breath
and
soils
the
teeth
and
often
stains
the
chin
beneath
the
smoker
tongue
is
badly
seared
and
he
has
clinkers
in
his
beard
of
nicotine
he
is
so
full
no
cannibull
would
eat
him
raw
well
done
or
rare
and
his
neckties
and
his
hair
his
hat
his
breath
and
trouserloons
suggest
and
cuspitoons
and
so
i
throw
my
pipe
away
upon
this
gladsome
new
year
day
my
friends
no
more
will
have
to
choke
and
wheeze
in
my
tobacco
smoke
since
then
the
days
drag
slowly
on
it
seems
as
though
ten
years
have
gone
i
walk
the
floor
the
long
night
through
and
jealous
watch
the
kitchen
flue
for
it
can
smoke
and
hold
carouse
and
not
bust
vows
the
cookstove
makes
my
vitals
gripe
for
it
can
use
its
trusty
pipe
thus
far
i
kept
the
vow
i
swore
but
do
not
tempt
me
any
more
do
talk
of
cabbage
on
the
place
or
flaunt
alfalfa
in
my
face
this
one
day
let
us
forget
all
the
little
things
that
fret
all
the
little
griefs
and
cares
which
are
bringing
us
gray
hairs
let
forget
the
evil
thought
and
the
ill
that
others
wrought
thinking
only
of
the
hand
that
has
led
us
through
a
land
smiling
with
a
richer
store
than
fair
canaan
knew
of
yore
let
forget
to
jeer
and
rail
at
the
men
who
fight
and
fail
let
forget
to
criticise
motes
within
our
eyes
thinking
only
of
the
hand
that
has
led
us
through
a
land
where
the
toiler
gets
reward
where
no
grasping
overlord
harries
men
with
lash
or
chain
robbing
them
of
brawn
and
brain
let
forget
malicious
things
better
is
the
heart
that
sings
than
the
one
that
harbors
hate
which
is
aye
a
killing
weight
let
forget
the
scowling
brow
it
the
time
for
gladness
now
it
the
time
for
birds
kindly
smiles
and
cheerful
words
it
a
time
to
try
to
rise
somewhat
nearer
to
the
skies
thinking
only
of
a
hand
that
will
lead
us
to
a
land
in
the
distances
above
where
the
countersign
is
love
walter
sir
walter
raleigh
sat
in
jail
removed
from
strife
and
flurry
the
light
was
dim
his
bread
was
stale
and
yet
he
did
worry
he
knew
the
headsman
grim
and
dour
with
sleeves
and
frock
off
might
come
to
him
at
any
hour
and
cut
his
blooming
block
off
he
knew
that
he
would
evermore
with
dismal
chains
be
laden
till
he
had
traveled
through
the
door
that
opens
into
aidenn
to
have
his
name
wiped
off
the
map
king
james
was
in
a
hurry
and
yet
he
was
a
dauntless
chap
he
still
refused
to
worry
serenely
he
pursued
his
work
and
wrote
his
lustrous
pages
serenely
as
a
smiling
clerk
who
writes
for
weekly
wages
and
when
the
headsman
came
and
said
i
hate
the
job
sir
walter
but
i
must
ask
you
for
your
head
the
great
man
did
not
falter
gadzooks
quoth
he
and
eke
odsfish
thou
art
a
courteous
shaver
take
off
my
head
i
only
wish
i
might
return
the
favor
and
so
the
headsman
swung
the
axe
beneath
the
sky
of
surrey
sir
walter
died
beneath
his
whacks
but
still
refused
to
worry
country
o
come
i
said
to
the
printer
man
who
edits
the
weekly
swish
a
rest
will
do
you
a
lot
of
good
so
come
to
the
creek
and
fish
if
you
wait
a
while
said
the
printer
man
i
toddle
along
i
think
but
first
i
must
write
up
some
local
dope
and
open
a
can
of
ink
and
carry
in
coal
for
the
office
stove
and
mix
up
a
lot
of
paste
and
clean
the
grease
from
the
printing
press
with
a
bushel
of
cotton
waste
and
set
up
an
ad
for
the
auctioneer
and
throw
in
a
lot
of
type
and
hunt
up
a
plumber
and
have
him
see
what
clogging
the
waterpipe
and
call
on
the
doctor
to
have
him
soak
the
swellings
upon
my
head
for
i
had
it
punched
but
an
hour
ago
for
something
the
paper
said
i
fear
i
said
to
the
printer
man
if
i
wait
till
your
chore
list
fails
the
minnows
that
frolic
along
the
creek
will
all
be
as
large
as
whales
a
hundred
years
ago
and
more
men
wrung
their
hands
and
walked
the
floor
and
worried
over
this
or
that
and
thought
their
cares
would
squash
them
flat
where
are
those
worried
beings
now
the
bearded
goat
and
festive
cow
eat
grass
above
their
mouldered
bones
and
jay
birds
call
in
strident
tones
and
where
the
ills
they
worried
forgotten
all
for
ever
more
gone
all
the
sorrow
and
the
woe
that
lived
a
hundred
years
ago
the
grief
that
makes
you
scream
today
like
other
griefs
will
pass
away
and
when
you
cashed
your
little
string
and
jay
birds
your
bosom
sing
the
stranger
pausing
there
to
view
the
marble
works
that
cover
you
will
think
upon
the
uselessness
of
human
worry
and
distress
so
let
the
worry
business
slide
live
while
you
live
and
when
you
died
the
folks
will
say
around
your
bier
he
made
a
hit
while
he
was
here
well
may
a
startled
nation
mourn
with
wailings
greet
the
dawn
for
charlie
whiskers
have
been
shorn
another
landmark
gone
no
more
no
more
will
robins
nest
within
their
lilac
shade
for
they
are
folded
now
and
pressed
and
with
the
mothballs
laid
the
zephyrs
that
have
sobbed
and
sighed
athwart
that
hangdown
bunch
through
other
whiskers
now
must
glide
they
doubtless
take
the
hunch
vain
world
this
life
an
empty
boast
and
gods
have
feet
of
clay
the
things
we
love
and
honor
most
are
first
to
pass
away
the
world
seems
new
at
every
dawn
seems
new
and
queer
and
strange
and
we
can
scarce
keep
tab
upon
the
ringing
grooves
of
change
the
changing
sea
the
changing
land
are
speaking
of
decay
but
charlie
whiskers
still
will
stand
we
used
to
fondly
say
long
may
they
dodge
the
glinting
shears
and
shining
snickersnees
and
may
they
brave
a
thousand
years
the
battle
and
the
breeze
with
charlie
whiskers
in
the
van
we
fight
and
conquer
yet
and
show
the
world
that
there
one
man
who
not
a
suffragette
vain
dreams
vain
hopes
we
now
repine
and
snort
and
sweat
and
swear
for
sluggers
are
in
brine
and
charlie
chin
is
bare
it
he
used
to
take
a
flowing
bowl
perhaps
three
times
a
day
he
needed
it
to
brace
his
nerves
or
drive
the
blues
away
but
as
for
chaps
who
drank
too
much
they
simply
made
him
tired
a
drink
he
said
when
feeling
tough
is
much
to
be
desired
some
men
will
never
quit
the
game
while
they
can
raise
a
bone
but
i
can
drink
the
old
red
booze
or
let
the
stuff
alone
he
toddled
on
the
downward
path
and
seedy
grew
his
clothes
and
like
a
beacon
in
the
night
flamed
forth
his
bulbous
nose
he
lived
on
slaw
and
sweitzer
cheese
the
free
lunch
brand
of
fruits
and
when
he
sought
his
downy
couch
he
always
wore
his
boots
some
day
i
cut
it
out
he
said
my
will
is
still
my
own
and
i
can
hit
the
old
red
booze
or
let
the
stuff
alone
one
night
a
prison
surgeon
sat
by
this
poor
pilgrim
side
and
told
him
that
his
time
had
come
to
cross
the
great
divide
i
known
you
since
you
were
a
lad
the
stern
physician
said
and
i
have
watched
you
as
you
tried
to
paint
the
whole
world
red
and
if
you
wish
i
have
engraved
upon
your
churchyard
stone
dying
proved
that
he
could
let
the
old
red
booze
alone
of
the
some
day
this
heart
will
cease
to
beat
some
day
these
worn
and
weary
feet
will
tread
the
road
no
more
some
day
this
hand
will
drop
the
pen
and
never
never
write
again
those
rhymes
which
are
a
bore
and
sometimes
when
the
stars
swing
low
and
mystic
breezes
come
and
go
with
music
in
their
breath
i
think
of
destiny
and
fate
and
try
to
calmly
contemplate
this
bogie
men
call
death
such
thinking
does
not
raise
my
hair
my
cheerful
heart
declines
to
scare
or
thump
against
my
vest
for
death
when
all
is
said
and
done
is
but
the
dusk
at
set
of
sun
the
interval
of
rest
but
lines
of
sorrow
mark
my
brow
when
i
consider
that
my
frau
when
i
have
ceased
to
wink
will
have
to
face
a
crowd
of
gents
who
selling
cheap
tin
monuments
and
headstones
made
of
zinc
and
crayon
portrait
sharks
will
come
and
make
the
house
with
language
hum
and
ply
their
deadly
game
they
will
enlarge
my
photograph
attach
a
epitaph
and
put
it
in
a
frame
hang
that
horror
on
the
wall
and
then
when
neighbors
come
to
call
they
view
my
crayon
head
and
wipe
sad
tears
from
either
eye
and
lean
against
the
chairs
and
cry
how
fortunate
he
dead
dying
once
a
fisherman
was
dying
in
his
humble
lowly
cot
and
the
pastor
sat
beside
him
saying
things
that
hit
the
spot
so
that
all
his
futile
terrors
left
the
dying
sinner
heart
and
he
said
the
lonely
but
i
ready
for
the
start
there
is
just
one
little
matter
that
is
fretting
me
he
sighed
and
perhaps
i
better
tell
it
ere
i
cross
the
great
divide
i
have
got
a
string
of
stories
that
i
told
from
day
to
day
stories
of
the
fish
i
captured
and
the
ones
that
got
away
and
i
fear
that
when
i
tell
them
they
are
apt
to
stretch
a
mile
and
i
wonder
when
i
wafted
to
that
land
that
free
from
guile
if
they
let
me
tell
my
stories
if
i
try
to
tell
them
straight
or
will
angels
lose
their
tempers
then
and
chase
me
through
the
gate
then
the
pastor
sat
and
pondered
for
the
question
vexed
him
sore
never
such
a
weird
conundrum
had
been
sprung
on
him
before
yet
the
courage
of
conviction
moved
him
soon
to
a
reply
and
he
wished
to
fill
the
fisher
with
fair
visions
of
the
sky
you
can
doubtless
tell
fish
stories
said
the
clergyman
aloud
but
i
stretch
them
very
little
if
old
jonah
in
the
crowd
he
wrote
good
books
and
wrote
in
vain
and
writing
wore
out
heart
and
brain
the
few
would
buy
his
latest
tome
and
filled
with
gladness
take
it
home
and
read
it
through
from
end
to
end
and
lend
it
to
some
friend
the
few
would
say
it
was
a
shame
that
george
was
scarcely
in
the
game
that
grocers
butlers
clerks
and
cooks
would
never
read
his
helpful
books
but
blew
themselves
for
deadwood
dick
and
howling
hank
from
bitter
creek
the
bandit
that
nick
carter
caught
and
laura
libbey
tommyrot
alas
it
is
a
bitter
thing
rather
have
a
zenda
king
or
hold
with
sinclair
coarse
carouse
in
some
chicago
packing
house
or
wade
with
weyman
to
our
knees
in
yarns
of
swords
and
snickersnees
or
trek
with
haggard
to
the
veldt
where
zulus
seek
each
other
pelt
than
buy
a
volume
learned
and
deep
and
it
yawn
ourselves
to
sleep
smart
the
other
night
i
took
a
walk
and
called
on
jinx
across
the
block
the
home
of
jinx
was
full
of
boys
and
girls
and
forty
kinds
of
noise
dad
jinx
was
good
and
kind
and
straight
he
let
the
children
go
their
gait
he
never
spoke
a
sentence
cross
he
never
showed
that
he
was
boss
and
so
his
home
as
neighbors
know
was
like
the
ringling
wild
beast
show
we
tried
to
talk
about
the
crops
the
children
raised
their
fiendish
yawps
they
hunted
up
a
thomas
cat
and
placed
it
in
my
stovepipe
hat
they
jarred
me
with
a
carpet
tack
and
poured
ice
water
down
my
back
my
long
coat
tails
they
set
afire
and
this
aroused
my
ire
i
rose
majestic
in
my
wrath
and
through
those
children
mowed
a
path
i
smote
them
sorely
hip
and
thigh
and
piled
them
in
the
woodshed
nigh
i
threw
their
father
in
the
well
and
fired
his
cottage
with
a
yell
some
rigid
moralists
i
hear
have
said
my
course
was
too
severe
but
their
rebukes
can
not
affright
my
conscience
tells
me
i
was
right
illustration
little
resting
in
the
shadow
a
struggle
to
the
height
a
futile
search
for
el
dorado
and
then
we
say
good
a
little
work
a
little
sweating
a
few
brief
flying
years
a
little
joy
a
little
fretting
some
smiles
and
then
some
tears
a
little
resting
in
the
shadow
a
struggle
to
the
height
a
futile
search
for
el
dorado
and
then
we
say
good
night
some
moiling
in
the
strife
and
clangor
some
years
of
doubt
and
debt
some
words
we
spoke
in
foolish
anger
that
we
would
fain
forget
some
cheery
words
we
said
unthinking
that
made
a
sad
heart
light
the
banquet
with
its
feast
and
drinking
and
then
we
say
good
night
some
questioning
of
creeds
and
theories
and
judgment
of
the
dead
while
god
who
never
sleeps
or
wearies
is
watching
overhead
some
little
laughing
and
some
sighing
some
sorrow
some
delight
a
little
music
for
the
dying
and
then
we
say
good
night
have
the
maiden
lingered
in
her
bower
within
her
fathers
stately
tower
it
was
four
hundred
years
ago
her
lover
came
cliff
and
scar
and
twanged
the
strings
of
his
guitar
and
sang
his
love
songs
soft
and
low
he
said
her
breath
was
like
the
breeze
that
wandered
over
flowery
leas
her
cheeks
were
lovely
as
the
rose
her
eyes
were
stars
from
heaven
torn
and
she
was
guiltless
of
a
corn
upon
her
sweet
angelic
toes
for
hours
and
hours
his
songs
were
sung
until
a
puncture
spoiled
a
lung
and
then
of
course
he
had
to
quit
but
arabella
from
her
room
would
shoot
a
smile
that
lit
the
gloom
and
gave
him
a
conniption
fit
then
homeward
would
the
lover
hie
as
happy
as
an
august
fly
upon
a
bald
man
shining
head
and
arabella
heart
would
swell
with
happiness
too
great
to
tell
ah
me
those
good
old
times
are
dead
just
let
a
modern
lover
scheme
to
win
the
damsel
of
his
dream
by
punching
tunes
from
his
guitar
in
silver
tones
she
jeer
and
scoff
she
call
to
him
come
off
come
off
where
is
your
blooming
motor
car
little
my
little
dog
dot
is
a
sassy
pup
and
i
scold
him
in
savage
tones
for
he
keeps
the
garden
all
littered
up
with
feathers
and
rags
and
bones
he
drags
dead
cats
for
a
half
a
mile
and
sometimes
a
hen
and
when
i
have
carted
away
the
pile
he
builds
it
all
up
again
he
howls
for
hours
at
the
beaming
moon
and
thinks
it
a
melba
chore
and
neighbors
who
list
to
his
throbbing
tune
rear
up
in
the
air
and
roar
and
often
i
hand
down
this
stern
decree
this
critter
will
have
to
die
and
he
puts
his
paws
on
my
old
fat
knee
and
turns
up
a
loving
eye
and
he
wags
his
tail
and
he
seems
to
say
you
almost
too
fat
to
walk
and
your
knees
are
sprung
and
your
whiskers
gray
and
your
picture
would
stop
a
clock
some
other
doggies
might
turn
you
down
some
dogs
that
are
proud
and
grand
but
you
are
the
best
old
boss
in
town
i
love
you
to
beat
the
band
and
he
bats
his
eye
and
he
wags
his
tail
conveying
this
kindly
thought
and
i
rather
live
out
my
days
in
jail
than
injure
that
derned
dog
dot
thurston
he
so
familiar
with
the
great
this
harry
thurston
peck
that
every
man
of
high
estate
has
wept
upon
his
neck
the
poet
browning
pondered
deep
the
things
that
harry
said
lord
tennyson
was
wont
to
sleep
in
harry
when
ibsen
wrote
he
wildly
cried
my
life
will
be
a
wreck
if
this
my
drama
is
denied
the
praise
of
thurston
peck
said
kipling
in
his
better
days
what
use
is
my
renown
since
harry
scans
my
blooming
lays
and
blights
them
with
a
frown
the
poet
when
his
end
draws
near
cries
death
brings
no
alarms
if
i
in
that
grim
hour
of
fear
may
die
in
harry
arms
and
being
dead
his
spirit
knows
no
shade
of
doubt
or
gloom
if
harry
plants
a
little
rose
upon
his
humble
tomb
poor
shakespeare
and
those
elder
bards
who
haunt
the
blessed
isles
were
born
too
soon
for
such
rewards
as
harry
smiles
but
joy
will
lighten
their
despair
and
flood
the
realms
of
space
for
harry
peck
will
join
them
there
they
see
him
face
to
face
man
now
the
long
long
day
is
fading
and
the
hush
of
dusk
is
here
and
the
stars
begin
parading
each
one
in
its
distant
sphere
and
the
strident
voices
dwindle
to
a
gentle
hum
and
the
heart
of
man
rejoices
that
the
hour
of
rest
has
come
thrown
away
is
labor
fetter
when
the
day
has
reached
its
close
nothing
in
the
world
is
better
than
a
weary
man
repose
nothing
in
the
world
is
sweeter
than
the
sleep
the
toiler
finds
while
the
ravening
moskeeter
fusses
at
the
window
blinds
nothing
the
moon
can
wake
him
short
of
cannon
cracker
roar
if
rouse
him
you
must
shake
him
till
you
dump
him
on
the
floor
idle
people
seek
their
couches
seek
their
beds
to
toss
and
weep
for
a
demon
on
them
crouches
driving
from
their
eyes
the
sleep
and
the
weary
hours
they
number
and
they
cry
in
tones
distraught
for
a
little
wad
of
slumber
i
would
give
a
house
and
lot
when
the
long
long
day
is
dying
and
you
watch
the
twinkling
stars
knowing
that
you
soon
be
lying
sleeping
like
a
train
of
cars
be
then
thankful
without
measure
be
as
thankful
as
you
can
you
have
nailed
as
great
a
treasure
as
the
gods
have
given
man
tomorrow
said
the
languid
man
i
have
my
life
insured
i
guess
i
know
it
is
the
safest
plan
to
save
my
children
from
distress
and
when
the
morrow
came
around
they
placed
him
gently
in
a
box
at
break
of
morning
he
was
found
as
dead
as
julius
caesar
ox
his
widow
now
is
scrubbing
floors
and
washing
shirts
and
splitting
wood
and
doing
fifty
other
chores
that
she
may
rear
her
wailing
brood
tomorrow
said
the
careless
jay
i
take
an
hour
and
make
my
will
and
then
if
i
should
pass
away
the
wife
and
kids
will
know
no
the
morrow
came
serene
and
nice
the
weather
mild
with
signs
of
rain
the
careless
jay
was
placed
on
ice
embalming
fluid
in
his
brain
alas
alas
poor
careless
jay
the
lawyers
got
his
pile
of
cash
his
wife
is
toiling
night
and
day
to
keep
the
kids
in
clothes
and
hash
tomorrow
is
the
ambushed
walk
avoided
by
the
circumspect
tomorrow
is
the
fatal
rock
on
which
a
million
ships
are
wrecked
now
my
weary
heart
is
breaking
for
my
left
hand
tooth
is
aching
with
a
harsh
persistent
rumble
that
is
keeping
folks
awake
hollowed
out
by
long
erosion
it
with
spasm
and
explosion
seems
resolved
to
show
the
public
how
a
tooth
can
ache
now
it
quivering
or
quaking
now
it
doing
fancy
aching
then
it
shoots
some
roman
candles
which
go
whizzing
through
my
brain
now
it
does
some
lofty
tumbling
then
again
it
merely
grumbling
and
anon
it
showing
samples
of
spring
novelties
in
pain
all
the
time
my
woe
increases
i
have
kicked
a
chair
to
pieces
but
it
did
seem
to
soothe
me
or
to
bring
my
soul
relief
i
have
stormed
around
the
shanty
till
my
wife
and
maiden
auntie
said
pull
their
freight
and
leave
me
full
enjoyment
of
my
grief
i
have
made
myself
so
pleasant
that
i
quarantined
at
present
and
the
neighbors
say
they
shoot
me
if
i
venture
from
my
door
now
a
voice
cries
if
thou
wentest
in
the
first
place
to
a
dentist
it
is
strange
that
inspiration
never
came
to
me
before
farewell
i
said
to
the
friend
i
loved
and
my
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
i
know
you
come
to
my
heart
again
in
a
few
brief
hurried
years
ah
many
come
up
the
garden
path
and
knock
at
my
cottage
door
but
the
friend
i
loved
when
my
heart
was
young
comes
back
to
that
heart
no
more
farewell
i
cried
to
the
gentle
bird
whose
music
had
filled
the
dawn
you
fly
away
but
you
sing
again
when
the
winter
snows
are
gone
ah
the
bright
birds
sway
on
the
and
sing
as
they
sang
before
but
the
bird
i
loved
with
the
golden
voice
shall
sing
to
my
heart
no
more
farewell
i
said
to
the
thomas
cat
i
threw
in
the
gurgling
creek
all
weighted
down
with
a
smoothing
iron
and
a
hundredweight
of
brick
you
not
come
back
if
i
know
myself
from
the
silent
sunless
shore
then
i
journeyed
home
and
that
blamed
old
cat
was
there
by
the
kitchen
door
the
when
i
cash
in
and
this
poor
race
is
run
my
chores
performed
and
all
my
errands
done
i
know
that
folks
who
mock
my
efforts
here
will
weeping
bend
above
my
lowly
bier
and
bring
large
garlands
worth
three
bucks
a
throw
and
paw
the
ground
in
ecstasy
of
woe
and
friends
will
wear
crape
on
their
tiles
while
i
look
down
or
up
a
million
miles
and
wonder
why
those
people
never
knew
how
smooth
i
was
until
my
spirit
flew
when
i
cash
in
i
will
not
care
a
yen
for
all
the
praise
that
heaped
upon
me
then
serene
and
silent
in
my
handsome
box
i
shall
not
heed
the
laudatory
talks
and
all
the
pomp
and
all
the
vain
display
will
just
be
pomp
and
feathers
thrown
away
so
tell
me
now
while
i
am
on
the
earth
your
estimate
of
my
surprising
worth
o
tell
me
what
a
i
am
and
fill
me
full
of
taffy
and
of
jam
we
have
often
roasted
nero
that
he
played
the
violin
while
his
native
rome
was
burning
and
the
firemen
raised
a
din
there
he
sat
and
played
bedelia
heedless
of
the
fiery
storm
while
the
fire
chief
pranced
and
sweated
in
his
neat
red
uniform
and
i
often
think
that
nero
had
a
pretty
level
head
would
the
fire
have
been
extinguished
had
he
fussed
around
instead
would
the
fire
insurance
folks
have
loosened
up
a
shekel
more
had
old
nero
squirted
water
on
some
grocer
cellar
door
when
there
comes
a
big
disaster
people
straightway
lose
their
wits
they
go
round
with
hands
sweating
blood
and
throwing
fits
but
the
wise
man
sits
and
fiddles
plays
a
tune
from
end
to
end
for
it
never
pays
to
worry
over
things
you
can
not
mend
it
is
good
to
offer
battle
when
catastrophes
advance
it
is
well
to
keep
on
scrapping
while
a
fellow
has
a
chance
but
when
failure
is
as
certain
as
the
coming
of
the
dusk
then
it
wise
to
take
your
fiddle
and
fall
back
on
money
musk
real
if
you
should
chance
to
mention
death
most
men
will
have
a
grouch
and
yet
to
die
is
nothing
more
than
going
to
your
couch
when
you
have
done
your
little
stunt
performed
the
evening
chores
wound
up
the
clock
blown
out
the
light
and
put
the
cat
outdoors
the
good
old
world
jogged
smoothly
on
before
you
had
your
fling
and
it
will
jog
as
smoothly
on
when
you
have
cashed
your
string
king
death
himself
is
good
and
kind
he
always
does
his
best
to
soothe
the
heart
that
sorrowful
and
give
the
weary
rest
but
there
are
evils
in
his
train
that
daunt
the
stoutest
soul
and
one
of
them
may
serve
to
end
this
cheerful
rigmarole
i
always
have
a
haunting
dread
that
when
i
come
to
die
the
papers
of
the
town
will
tell
how
some
insurance
guy
paid
up
the
money
that
was
due
to
weeping
kin
of
mine
before
the
funeral
procesh
had
fallen
out
of
line
and
thus
they
use
me
for
an
ad
some
old
line
life
to
boom
before
i
had
a
chance
to
get
acquainted
with
my
tomb
in
the
hour
of
stress
when
the
outlook
blue
and
the
nation
in
a
box
there
always
a
statesman
strong
and
true
who
comes
to
the
front
and
talks
if
wind
would
banish
the
ills
we
see
and
drive
all
our
troubles
hence
then
the
talksmith
tongue
would
our
bulwark
be
and
his
larynx
our
chief
defense
we
groan
and
sweat
at
the
forge
and
mill
to
see
that
our
tax
is
paid
and
the
money
all
goes
to
pay
the
bill
for
the
noise
in
congress
made
wherever
you
go
the
talksmith
stands
with
his
winning
smile
and
smirk
and
busts
the
welkin
and
waves
his
hands
but
does
get
down
to
work
ah
well
my
friends
we
shall
scrape
and
peck
along
till
the
judgment
day
when
the
talksmith
climbs
on
the
old
world
wreck
and
talks
till
he
burns
away
it
is
woman
firm
ambition
to
attain
a
high
position
and
he
surely
is
a
caitiff
who
regrets
to
see
her
rise
i
for
one
will
hand
her
praises
load
her
down
with
cheering
phrases
if
in
seeking
higher
levels
she
does
not
neglect
the
pies
let
her
study
art
and
science
read
up
blackstone
and
his
clients
soak
herself
in
kant
or
browning
and
the
truth
that
in
them
lies
she
may
dote
on
keats
or
ruddy
if
she
cease
to
study
worthy
books
and
able
pamphlets
treating
of
uplifting
pies
now
and
then
my
spirit
shrinking
gets
to
doubting
brooding
thinking
that
the
pies
we
have
at
present
are
not
like
the
pies
of
yore
modern
dames
are
good
at
making
crusts
for
pies
and
good
at
baking
but
they
buy
the
stuff
to
fill
them
at
the
nearest
grocer
store
are
our
pies
as
good
as
ever
do
our
modern
dames
endeavor
to
produce
the
pie
triumphant
pies
that
make
us
better
men
if
they
do
then
who
would
chide
them
who
would
blame
them
or
deride
them
if
they
turn
from
pies
and
cookies
to
their
ibsen
books
again
illustration
saw
the
form
of
a
cringing
bum
all
crumpled
and
soaked
with
magic
i
went
one
night
with
my
thirst
to
loaf
in
the
booze
bazar
and
as
i
sampled
the
old
red
dope
i
leaned
on
the
handsome
bar
my
purse
was
full
of
the
good
long
green
and
my
raiment
was
smooth
and
new
and
i
looked
as
slick
as
a
cabbage
rose
that
kissed
by
the
nice
wet
dew
behind
the
bottles
a
mirror
stood
as
large
as
your
parlor
floor
and
i
looked
and
looked
in
the
shining
glass
and
wondered
and
looked
some
more
my
own
reflection
did
not
appear
but
there
where
it
should
have
been
i
saw
the
form
of
a
cringing
bum
all
crumpled
and
soaked
with
gin
his
nose
was
red
and
his
eyes
were
dim
unshorn
was
his
swollen
face
and
i
thought
it
queer
such
a
seedy
bo
would
come
to
so
smooth
a
place
i
turned
around
for
a
better
look
at
this
effigy
of
despair
and
nearly
fell
in
a
little
heap
for
the
effigy
was
there
the
barkeep
laughed
it
the
magic
glass
he
said
with
a
careless
yawn
it
shows
a
man
how
he
apt
to
look
years
hence
when
his
roll
is
gone
misfit
a
certain
man
who
lived
some
place
was
gifted
with
a
misfit
face
when
nature
built
his
mug
she
broke
all
rules
and
tried
to
play
a
joke
of
pale
red
hair
he
had
a
thatch
his
eyes
were
green
and
did
match
his
nose
was
pug
his
chin
was
weak
and
freckles
grew
on
either
cheek
and
sorrel
whiskers
fringed
his
chop
too
thin
to
ever
make
a
crop
and
people
when
they
first
beheld
his
countenance
just
stopped
and
yelled
but
when
they
known
him
for
a
while
and
marked
his
glad
and
genial
smile
when
passing
time
had
made
them
wise
to
all
the
kindness
in
those
eyes
and
when
they
found
that
from
his
face
there
came
no
sayings
mean
or
base
that
misfit
mug
they
often
scan
and
cry
he
is
a
handsome
man
dog
a
large
black
dog
of
stately
mien
was
walking
the
village
green
on
some
important
errand
bent
a
little
cur
not
worth
a
cent
observed
him
passing
by
and
growled
and
barked
a
while
and
yapped
and
howled
the
big
one
did
not
deign
a
look
but
walked
along
like
prince
or
dook
the
cur
remarked
beneath
its
breath
that
big
scared
to
death
those
great
big
brutes
are
never
game
now
just
watch
fido
climb
his
frame
the
big
black
dog
went
stalking
on
as
calm
and
tranquil
as
the
dawn
he
knew
the
cur
was
at
his
heels
he
heard
its
yaps
and
snarls
and
squeals
and
yet
he
never
looked
around
or
blinked
an
eye
or
made
a
sound
his
meditations
had
a
tone
that
mangy
pups
have
never
known
the
cur
unnoticed
lost
all
fear
it
grabbed
the
big
dog
by
the
ear
the
latter
paused
just
long
enough
to
take
the
small
one
by
the
scruff
and
shake
him
gently
to
and
fro
and
then
he
let
poor
fido
go
and
said
in
quiet
tones
now
get
and
fido
doubtless
running
yet
suppose
you
see
if
you
can
nail
the
moral
hidden
in
this
tale
i
like
to
be
a
pitcher
and
on
the
diamond
stand
a
cap
upon
my
forehead
a
ball
within
my
hand
before
applauding
thousands
i
throw
the
curving
sphere
and
from
the
eyes
of
batsmen
bring
forth
the
briny
tear
i
make
my
occupation
a
thing
of
pomp
and
dread
i
tie
myself
in
and
stand
upon
my
head
a
string
of
wild
contortions
would
mark
my
every
throw
and
all
the
fans
would
murmur
oh
girls
ai
he
a
jo
and
when
i
left
the
diamond
on
rest
or
pleasure
bent
the
kids
would
trail
behind
me
and
worship
as
they
went
and
all
the
sporty
grownups
would
say
he
warm
enough
and
fair
and
cultured
ladies
would
cry
he
is
the
stuff
i
like
to
be
a
pitcher
while
i
remain
below
by
day
to
gather
garlands
by
night
to
count
the
dough
and
once
a
hunter
met
a
lion
near
the
hungry
critter
lair
and
the
way
that
lion
mauled
him
was
decidedly
unfair
but
the
hunter
never
whimpered
when
the
surgeons
with
their
thread
sewed
up
gashes
in
his
mutilated
head
and
he
showed
the
scars
in
triumph
and
they
gave
him
pleasant
fame
and
he
always
blessed
the
lion
that
had
camped
upon
his
frame
once
that
hunter
sat
upon
a
hill
of
ants
and
about
a
million
bit
him
and
you
should
have
seen
him
dance
and
he
used
up
lots
of
language
of
a
deep
magenta
tint
and
apostrophized
the
insects
in
a
style
unfit
to
print
and
it
thus
with
wordly
troubles
when
the
big
ones
come
along
we
serenely
go
to
meet
them
feeling
valiant
bold
and
strong
but
the
weary
little
worries
with
their
poisoned
stings
and
smarts
put
the
lid
upon
our
courage
make
us
gray
and
break
our
hearts
nameless
we
only
know
they
fought
and
died
and
their
graves
the
wind
has
sighed
for
many
a
long
year
and
winter
snow
has
drifted
here
and
in
the
dawning
warmth
of
spring
the
joyous
birds
came
here
to
sing
we
only
know
that
rest
is
sweet
to
weary
hearts
and
toiling
feet
and
they
who
sleep
beneath
the
sod
gave
all
they
had
to
give
to
god
and
in
the
radiance
of
the
throne
their
names
are
known
their
names
are
known
we
know
not
from
what
homes
they
came
we
can
but
guess
their
dreams
of
fame
but
lamps
for
them
did
vainly
burn
and
mothers
waited
their
return
and
listened
at
some
cottage
door
for
steps
that
sounded
never
more
and
loving
eyes
grew
dim
with
tears
and
hearts
grew
old
with
grief
of
years
and
here
they
sleep
as
they
have
slept
since
legions
the
country
swept
where
mothers
wait
before
the
throne
their
names
are
known
their
names
are
known
when
i
hear
a
noble
singer
reeling
off
entrancing
noise
then
i
bend
in
admiration
and
his
music
never
cloys
and
i
feel
a
high
ambition
as
a
singer
to
excel
and
i
put
my
voice
in
training
and
i
prance
around
and
yell
oh
i
dish
up
trills
and
warbles
and
i
think
throughout
the
day
that
i
have
caruso
faded
ere
a
month
has
rolled
away
then
the
neighbors
come
and
see
me
and
they
give
me
stern
reproof
saying
i
am
worse
than
forty
yellow
cats
upon
the
roof
when
i
see
a
splendid
painting
it
appeals
to
brain
and
heart
and
i
blow
myself
for
brushes
and
decide
to
follow
art
with
a
can
of
yellow
ochre
and
a
jug
of
turpentine
i
produce
some
masterpieces
that
would
make
old
rubens
pine
and
i
talk
about
perspective
and
the
whatness
of
the
whence
till
a
neighbor
comes
and
asks
me
what
i
take
to
paint
his
fence
when
i
read
a
rattling
volume
i
invest
in
pens
and
ink
and
prepare
to
write
some
chapters
that
will
make
the
nation
think
and
i
rear
some
vandyke
whiskers
and
neglect
to
cut
my
hair
and
i
read
up
bulwer
lytton
for
some
good
old
oaths
to
swear
when
i
get
the
proper
bearing
and
the
literary
style
then
i
asked
to
write
a
pamphlet
booming
some
castor
ile
at
night
you
seek
your
downy
bed
and
ere
you
sink
to
sleep
and
dreams
that
strange
machine
you
call
your
head
is
full
of
weird
and
wondrous
schemes
they
seem
too
grand
and
great
to
fail
they
fill
your
treasury
with
dough
but
morning
shows
them
flat
and
stale
i
often
wonder
why
is
so
at
eve
you
are
a
blithesome
soul
your
future
is
the
one
good
bet
you
gaily
quaff
the
flowing
bowl
or
dance
the
stately
minuet
your
joy
obtrusive
and
intense
but
morning
finds
you
full
of
woe
you
sell
yourself
for
twenty
cents
i
often
wonder
why
is
so
at
night
you
walk
beneath
the
stars
and
high
ambitions
fill
your
soul
you
batter
down
opposing
bars
and
fight
your
way
and
win
the
goal
but
morning
passes
you
the
ice
your
visions
fade
your
spirit
low
you
spend
the
long
day
shaking
dice
i
often
wonder
why
is
so
at
night
you
think
of
things
sublime
and
inspiration
fills
your
heart
you
think
you
write
a
deathless
rhyme
or
cut
a
swath
in
realms
of
art
but
morning
finds
you
looking
sick
you
feel
you
have
any
show
you
dig
some
bait
and
seek
the
creek
i
often
wonder
why
is
so
and
before
the
fight
the
bruiser
said
i
surely
kill
that
aleck
dead
he
thinks
he
has
a
chance
with
me
his
gall
is
beautiful
to
see
his
friends
are
betting
quite
a
stack
and
say
that
i
can
not
come
back
better
now
i
say
right
here
than
ever
in
my
great
career
i
sound
and
good
in
wind
and
limb
and
i
will
put
the
lid
on
him
just
take
it
from
me
take
it
straight
i
fit
to
lick
a
hundredweight
of
wildcats
wolves
or
rattlesnakes
i
whip
him
in
a
brace
of
shakes
the
fight
was
the
bruiser
sat
his
head
too
large
to
fit
his
hat
his
eyes
bunged
up
his
teeth
knocked
in
he
muttered
with
a
swollen
grin
well
yes
he
licked
me
that
blamed
ape
but
i
was
badly
out
of
shape
i
did
train
the
way
i
should
my
knees
were
stiff
my
wind
no
good
i
had
lumbago
and
the
gout
no
wonder
that
he
knocked
me
out
but
just
you
wait
ten
years
or
more
i
after
that
gore
when
i
have
rested
for
a
spell
and
when
my
face
is
good
and
well
i
spring
a
challenge
good
and
hard
and
whip
him
in
his
own
back
yard
the
wizard
of
the
garden
the
scientist
who
found
a
way
to
raise
a
peartree
with
branches
underground
who
gave
us
boneless
pumpkins
and
peas
and
lettuce
and
beets
that
grow
on
trees
this
wizard
of
the
garden
with
venom
is
assailed
by
lesser
lights
of
science
who
tried
his
stunts
and
failed
and
thus
it
was
forever
and
thus
always
be
the
man
who
wins
must
suffer
the
shafts
of
calumny
we
mostly
small
potatoes
we
critters
here
on
earth
we
kick
at
big
achievements
we
snarl
at
sterling
worth
we
view
the
greater
triumphs
of
industry
and
art
and
if
we
find
no
blemish
it
nearly
breaks
our
heart
go
on
o
luther
burbank
the
wizard
of
the
west
heed
not
the
hoots
of
people
by
jealousy
oppressed
send
forth
your
roses
to
scent
a
thousand
junes
produce
your
horseless
radish
and
double
action
prunes
too
i
love
the
sun
and
the
gentle
breeze
and
the
brook
that
winds
through
the
pleasant
vale
and
i
love
the
birds
and
i
love
the
trees
and
always
glad
when
i
out
of
jail
we
are
governed
now
by
so
many
laws
that
liberty
dead
and
we
heard
its
knell
and
the
wise
man
carries
a
set
of
saws
to
cut
his
way
from
a
prison
cell
the
grocer
wails
in
a
dungeon
deep
for
he
sold
an
egg
that
was
out
of
date
the
fetters
wo
let
him
sleep
a
loaf
of
his
bread
was
under
weight
the
butcher
beats
at
his
prison
door
and
fills
the
air
with
his
doleful
moan
they
cut
off
his
head
when
the
night
is
for
he
sold
a
steak
that
was
mostly
bone
the
milkman
there
in
the
prison
yard
and
the
jailers
flog
him
and
make
him
jump
it
seems
to
me
that
his
fate
is
hard
though
he
did
draw
milk
from
the
old
home
pump
a
sickly
weed
that
was
lank
and
thin
embellished
my
lot
at
the
edge
of
town
and
the
peelers
nabbed
me
and
ran
me
in
because
i
neglected
to
cut
it
down
i
dropped
a
can
as
i
crossed
the
park
and
that
is
a
crime
that
against
the
law
so
they
shut
me
up
in
a
dungeon
dark
with
its
rusty
chains
and
its
moldy
straw
i
love
the
brook
and
the
summer
breeze
and
i
rather
mashed
on
the
howling
gale
and
i
fond
of
robins
and
bumblebees
and
i
always
glad
when
i
out
of
jail
in
the
hero
of
this
simple
tale
was
born
of
parents
beastly
poor
they
toiled
and
wrought
without
avail
to
scrape
a
living
from
the
moor
our
hero
early
made
resolve
that
he
would
strive
for
greater
heights
let
others
in
these
ruts
revolve
and
carry
on
their
puny
fights
to
gather
wealth
to
live
in
state
is
all
that
makes
this
life
worth
while
and
when
i
grown
i
pull
my
freight
and
try
to
raise
a
mighty
pile
his
dreams
came
true
in
every
way
as
visions
came
in
days
of
old
he
took
no
time
for
rest
or
play
but
gathered
in
fat
yellow
gold
by
steady
steps
our
hero
rose
to
heights
of
usefulness
and
fame
he
put
the
kibosh
on
his
foes
and
held
the
ace
in
every
game
he
laughed
at
figtrees
and
at
vines
and
all
domestic
trifling
things
he
owned
some
railways
and
some
mines
and
was
among
the
copper
kings
but
why
detail
his
glories
so
why
should
we
try
to
count
his
dimes
it
is
enough
for
us
to
know
he
been
indicted
twenty
times
hookworm
he
was
a
mournful
looking
wreck
with
yellow
face
and
scrawny
neck
and
weary
eyes
that
looked
as
though
they
had
monopoly
of
woe
too
tired
to
get
his
labors
done
all
day
he
loitered
in
the
sun
and
filled
the
air
with
yawns
and
moans
while
people
called
him
lazybones
one
day
the
doctor
came
and
said
brace
up
my
friend
hold
up
your
head
the
hookworm
deadly
as
an
asp
has
got
you
in
its
loathsome
grasp
but
i
will
break
the
hookworm
lose
and
cook
its
everlasting
goose
swing
wide
your
mouth
and
do
not
cringe
and
then
he
took
his
big
syringe
and
shot
about
a
quart
of
dope
that
tasted
like
a
bar
of
soap
adown
the
patient
yawning
throat
i
guess
i
got
that
hookworm
goat
one
gasping
breath
the
patient
drew
and
bit
a
lightning
rod
in
two
and
vaulted
his
cottage
roof
and
then
on
nimble
joyous
hoof
he
sped
across
the
windswept
plain
and
burned
a
school
and
robbed
a
train
the
doctor
watched
his
patient
streak
across
the
landscape
sere
and
bleak
and
said
it
makes
my
bosom
warm
what
wonders
science
can
perform
o
alfred
of
the
withered
bays
and
harp
of
nice
clean
celluloid
why
do
you
spend
the
passing
days
in
singing
of
an
aching
void
why
sing
a
roundelay
that
means
no
more
than
choctaw
to
a
turk
is
it
because
the
magazines
will
pay
you
kopecks
for
your
work
o
alfred
of
the
bloodless
rhyme
that
savors
more
of
milk
than
fire
bethink
you
of
the
olden
time
when
poets
really
smote
the
lyre
producing
strains
of
noble
swell
that
touched
and
stirred
the
hearts
of
all
and
made
the
soulful
people
yell
and
bat
their
heads
against
the
wall
we
listen
to
the
songs
you
croon
among
the
fogs
across
the
sea
your
poor
old
harp
is
out
of
tune
its
strings
were
made
in
germany
far
better
poets
roam
the
hills
of
this
fair
land
and
feed
on
hope
and
write
wild
songs
of
liver
pills
or
jimson
soap
old
it
was
a
bent
and
ancient
man
who
toiled
with
spade
and
pick
and
down
his
haggard
features
ran
the
sweatdrops
rolling
thick
and
as
he
toiled
his
gasping
sighs
spoke
darkly
of
despair
a
hopeless
look
was
in
his
eyes
a
look
of
grief
and
care
he
toiled
all
heedless
of
the
crowd
that
journeyed
to
and
fro
it
is
a
shame
i
said
aloud
that
age
should
suffer
so
he
overheard
me
and
he
said
i
earned
this
fate
in
truth
when
young
i
stained
the
landscape
red
i
was
a
gilded
youth
i
bought
the
merchandise
that
wet
i
fooled
with
games
of
chance
and
now
in
misery
and
sweat
i
wear
the
name
of
pance
i
was
a
rounder
and
a
sport
a
spender
and
a
blood
and
now
when
i
loom
up
in
court
my
only
name
is
mud
i
filled
my
years
with
gorgeous
breaks
i
thought
my
life
a
game
i
threw
my
money
to
the
drakes
and
wallowed
deep
in
shame
i
used
to
hate
the
those
lads
who
were
content
with
milder
joys
and
salted
down
the
scads
and
now
i
see
them
passing
by
in
opulence
and
ease
while
i
too
luckless
to
die
am
doing
tasks
like
these
sometimes
in
racking
dreams
i
see
the
money
that
i
burned
but
do
not
waste
your
tears
on
me
i
getting
what
i
earned
darling
hush
your
tears
are
welling
from
your
azure
angel
eyes
but
you
do
no
good
by
yelling
hush
my
baby
dear
be
wise
i
would
give
the
soothing
syrup
that
you
want
to
quell
this
storm
but
i
fear
that
it
would
stir
up
trouble
in
your
darling
form
once
i
prized
that
syrup
highly
thinking
it
was
just
the
stuff
but
i
wrote
to
wiley
and
he
says
it
bad
enough
once
the
doctor
also
prized
it
but
he
found
o
baby
fair
after
he
had
analyzed
it
that
an
ounce
would
kill
a
bear
it
supposed
to
cure
the
colic
and
to
check
the
infant
spleen
but
it
strongly
alcoholic
and
contains
some
paris
green
it
has
killed
a
frightful
number
and
will
kill
a
legion
more
sleep
my
darling
sleep
and
slumber
while
your
daddy
walks
the
floor
the
teacher
in
the
country
school
expounding
lesson
sum
and
rule
and
teaching
children
how
to
rise
to
heights
where
lasting
honor
lies
deserves
a
fat
and
handsome
wage
for
she
a
triumph
of
this
age
no
better
work
than
hers
is
done
beneath
the
good
old
shining
sun
she
builds
the
future
of
the
state
she
guides
the
youths
who
will
be
great
she
gives
the
childish
spirit
wings
and
points
the
way
to
noble
things
and
we
who
do
all
things
so
well
and
of
our
institooshuns
yell
reward
the
teacher
with
a
roll
that
brings
a
shudder
to
her
soul
we
have
our
coin
done
up
in
crates
and
gladly
hand
it
to
the
skates
who
fuss
around
in
politics
and
fool
us
with
their
tricks
in
congress
one
cheap
common
jay
will
loaf
a
week
and
draw
more
pay
than
some
tired
teacher
toiling
near
will
ever
see
in
half
a
year
if
i
was
running
this
old
land
i
have
a
lot
of
statesmen
canned
and
congressmen
and
folks
like
those
would
have
to
work
for
board
and
clothes
i
put
the
lid
on
scores
of
snaps
and
pour
into
the
laps
the
wealth
that
now
away
is
sinned
for
words
and
wigglejaws
and
wind
into
this
world
the
poet
poe
was
born
a
hundred
years
ago
and
in
this
world
he
lived
and
wrought
alone
and
understanding
not
his
feet
toiled
through
this
vale
of
tears
his
spirit
roamed
in
other
spheres
a
dreamer
from
parnassus
hurled
into
a
sordid
workday
world
where
gold
the
god
of
all
things
seems
and
men
who
dream
must
live
on
dreams
and
so
with
shades
the
poet
talked
and
so
with
ghosts
the
poet
walked
and
watched
with
psyche
hand
in
hand
a
world
he
could
not
understand
the
children
of
our
neighborhood
do
train
their
parents
as
they
should
they
let
the
latter
go
their
gait
and
do
not
try
to
keep
them
straight
and
so
those
giddy
parents
roam
at
sinful
hours
away
from
home
they
try
to
cheer
their
foolish
hearts
in
the
or
you
will
find
when
they
are
missed
that
they
are
playing
bridge
or
whist
or
wasting
all
the
golden
day
in
some
absurd
and
useless
way
when
i
was
young
i
seldom
saw
a
sporty
pa
or
giddy
ma
the
children
of
that
elder
day
had
parents
tutored
to
obey
the
mothers
seldom
left
their
tubs
to
fool
around
at
euchre
clubs
and
fathers
when
the
day
was
dead
took
off
their
rags
and
went
to
bed
ah
seldom
then
were
children
seen
with
furrowed
brow
and
sombre
mien
distraught
by
galivanting
dads
or
mas
who
played
the
cards
for
scads
o
children
to
yourselves
be
true
round
up
the
galivanting
crew
of
parents
who
are
trotting
fast
before
it
is
too
everlast
ing
late
to
give
the
bunch
a
chance
come
forth
o
children
from
your
trance
dad
is
growing
old
and
weary
and
there
silver
in
his
hair
and
his
eyes
are
always
solemn
he
has
seen
so
much
of
care
he
has
seen
so
much
of
sorrow
he
has
known
so
much
of
tears
he
has
borne
the
heat
and
burden
of
so
many
bitter
years
dad
already
in
the
twilight
of
little
fleeting
day
and
perhaps
we
often
ponder
when
his
load
is
laid
away
on
the
steps
we
might
have
saved
him
when
his
feet
and
hands
were
sore
on
the
joy
we
might
have
given
to
the
heart
that
beats
no
more
we
recall
a
hundred
errands
that
we
might
have
gladly
run
and
a
hundred
kindly
actions
that
we
might
have
gaily
done
we
remember
how
he
labored
while
the
boys
were
all
at
play
when
the
darkness
hides
him
from
us
at
the
closing
of
the
day
the
village
marshal
watchful
wight
was
bound
to
hold
his
job
down
right
he
saw
john
bunyan
running
loose
and
put
him
in
the
calaboose
now
john
the
tinker
had
renown
for
jarring
up
the
little
town
and
all
the
local
sages
said
that
he
would
never
die
in
bed
but
when
he
found
himself
in
soak
he
said
the
sporting
life
no
joke
here
where
i
cut
it
out
and
strive
to
show
the
world
that
i
alive
and
in
that
dark
and
dismal
den
he
sat
with
paper
ink
and
pen
and
wrote
the
book
that
people
hold
as
being
worth
its
weight
in
gold
the
job
was
hard
in
cells
beneath
they
heard
the
grinding
of
his
teeth
he
wrote
a
sentence
wise
he
had
to
stop
and
swat
the
flies
the
grub
was
poor
the
water
foul
the
jailer
sombre
as
an
owl
the
jail
was
full
of
dirt
and
dust
the
chains
he
wore
were
brown
with
rust
yet
through
it
all
by
hook
or
crook
he
toiled
and
wrote
his
matchless
book
o
authors
of
the
present
day
whose
books
are
dry
as
bales
of
hay
who
grind
best
sellers
by
the

last
from

things
that
he
needs
things
that
a
man
must
eat
lemons
and
prunes
and
meat
cost
like
sam
hill
carpets
and
rugs
and
mats
neckties
and
shoes
and
hats
shirting
to
hide
his
slats
empty
his
till
all
through
the
week
i
work
like
an
unlaundered
turk
for
a
few
bucks
no
odds
how
hard
i
try
of
wealth
always
shy
and
when
i
travel
i
ride
on
the
trucks
they
say
that
half
a
plunk
bought
more
and
better
junk
in
the
old
days
than
will
two
bones
or
more
in
the
big
modern
store
since
prices
learned
to
soar
five
hundred
ways
my
country
hear
my
word
you
are
a
hummingbird
also
a
peach
splendid
in
peace
and
war
thou
most
effulgent
star
tell
me
why
prices
are
clear
out
of
reach
yellow
when
a
tiresome
chinese
statesman
bores
his
queen
or
overlord
he
receives
a
little
package
that
contains
a
yellow
cord
and
the
statesman
realizes
that
it
is
no
use
to
roar
so
he
hangs
himself
in
silence
to
the
nearest
sycamore
let
us
borrow
from
the
wisdom
of
the
rulers
of
cathay
let
us
put
this
grand
old
custom
into
common
use
today
let
the
president
distribute
samples
of
the
saffron
string
to
the
statesmen
who
have
bored
us
since
the
early
days
of
spring
with
their
figures
and
statistics
and
their
buncombe
and
hot
air
and
their
misfit
oratory
which
wo
lead
us
anywhere
we
might
all
perhaps
be
rescued
from
an
ordeal
that
abhorred
if
big
bill
would
send
the
talkers
twenty
feet
of
yellow
cord
important
you
know
the
man
of
kingly
air
you
run
across
him
everywhere
he
seems
to
think
his
hat
a
crown
he
talks
as
though
he
handed
down
most
all
the
wisdom
that
the
seers
have
gathered
in
a
thousand
years
his
dignity
is
most
sublime
to
joke
about
him
is
a
crime
and
when
you
meet
him
it
is
wise
to
lift
your
hat
and
close
your
eyes
and
it
would
please
him
if
you
just
lie
down
and
grovel
in
the
dust
that
is
the
wiser
course
i
say
but
i
a
jay
and
when
i
meet
the
man
i
jolly
him
the
best
i
can
i
would
to
him
the
fact
recall
that
he
but
mortal
after
all
he
naught
but
bones
and
legs
and
trunk
and
lungs
and
lights
and
kindred
junk
he
breathes
the
same
old
germy
air
breathed
by
hoboes
everywhere
and
when
he
dies
as
die
he
must
make
as
cheap
a
grade
of
dust
as
any
richard
roe
in
town
the
monument
that
holds
him
down
may
tell
his
glories
for
a
while
but
folks
will
read
it
with
a
smile
and
say
that
dead
one
must
have
thought
that
he
was
johnnie
on
the
spot
when
he
was
on
this
earthly
shore
i
never
heard
of
him
before
a
thousand
cares
oppress
the
mind
in
life
long
summer
day
we
weary
of
the
galling
grind
and
endless
seems
the
way
the
journey
really
not
so
long
we
have
not
far
to
roam
and
soon
we
hear
the
evensong
and
then
we
toddle
home
our
burdens
seem
an
awful
pile
and
yet
they
not
so
great
if
we
would
pack
them
with
a
smile
we
would
not
feel
the
weight
we
murmur
as
we
hold
the
plow
and
guide
it
through
the
loam
but
dusk
is
coming
even
now
and
soon
we
toddle
home
we
see
a
cloud
of
sullen
gray
and
straightway
we
repine
the
storm
is
rising
fast
we
say
the
sun
no
more
will
shine
but
in
a
space
his
golden
beams
will
light
the
azure
dome
until
shall
come
the
time
for
dreams
and
then
we
toddle
home
no
trouble
lasts
if
we
are
brave
and
take
a
manly
stand
and
fear
becomes
a
cringing
slave
if
we
but
raise
a
hand
the
evil
that
disturbs
our
rest
is
but
a
shadow
gnome
the
sun
is
sinking
in
the
west
and
soon
we
toddle
home
then
let
us
toddle
home
as
gay
as
birds
that
never
weep
as
glad
as
children
tired
of
play
who
only
wish
to
sleep
and
while
recording
angels
write
our
names
in
heaven
tome
we
seek
our
couch
and
say
good
night
when
we
have
toddled
home
the
wise
man
with
some
boys
in
tow
beheld
a
pin
upon
the
ground
my
lads
he
said
his
face
aglow
come
here
and
see
what
i
have
found
is
but
a
pin
a
humble
pin
on
which
the
passing
thousands
tread
and
some
unthinking
men
would
grin
to
see
me
lift
it
from
its
bed
and
yet
my
lads
the
trifles
count
the
drops
of
water
make
the
sea
the
grains
of
sand
compose
the
mount
and
moments
make
eternity
each
hour
to
man
its
chances
brings
but
he
will
gain
no
goodly
store
if
he
despises
little
things
nor
sees
the
pin
upon
his
floor
i
stoop
and
grasp
this
little
pin
i
keep
it
maybe
seven
years
it
yet
may
let
the
sunshine
in
and
brighten
up
a
day
of
tears
the
wise
man
bent
to
reach
the
pin
and
lost
his
balance
with
a
yell
he
hit
the
pavement
with
his
chin
his
hat
into
the
gutter
fell
he
rolled
into
a
crate
of
eggs
and
filled
the
air
with
dismal
moans
and
then
a
dray
ran
his
legs
and
broke
about
a
gross
of
bones
they
took
him
home
upon
a
door
and
there
he
moans
so
tough
he
feels
those
children
never
more
will
listen
to
my
helpful
spiels
they
doom
you
dobbin
now
and
then
they
say
your
usefulness
is
gone
some
blame
fool
thing
designed
by
men
has
put
the
equine
race
in
pawn
they
doomed
you
and
your
hopes
were
low
when
bicycles
were
all
the
rage
they
said
the
horse
will
have
to
go
he
lags
on
the
stage
they
doomed
you
when
the
was
given
its
resplendent
birth
thus
sinks
the
poor
old
horse
star
he
have
to
beat
it
from
the
earth
and
now
they
dooming
you
some
more
there
are
so
many
motor
things
men
scorch
the
earth
with
sullen
roar
or
float
around
on
hardware
wings
they
doom
you
dobbin
now
and
then
and
call
you
and
the
like
but
while
this
world
is
breeding
men
the
horse
will
still
be
on
the
pike
no
painted
thing
of
cogs
and
wheels
and
entrails
made
of
noisy
brass
can
supplant
a
horse
heels
or
make
man
grudge
a
horse
his
grass
no
trap
of
bars
and
springs
can
love
or
confidence
impart
nor
give
the
little
neigh
that
brings
emotion
to
the
horseman
heart
o
build
your
cars
and
ships
and
planes
and
doom
old
dobbin
as
you
will
while
men
have
souls
and
hearts
and
brains
old
dobbin
shall
be
with
us
still
high
at
the
where
i
board
but
one
topic
now
prevails
how
the
price
of
grub
has
soared
drearily
the
landlord
wails
in
his
old
accustomed
place
he
is
sitting
at
each
meal
sad
and
is
his
face
as
he
carves
his
ancient
veal
when
i
ask
that
solemn
jay
if
he
pass
the
butter
butter
costs
i
hear
him
say
almost
half
a
bone
a
pound
when
i
want
a
slice
of
duck
his
expression
is
a
sin
this
thin
drake
cost
me
a
buck
and
the
quacks
were
not
thrown
in
through
the
muddy
coffee
steam
i
can
hear
him
saying
now
i
desired
a
pint
of
cream
and
they
charged
me
for
a
cow
let
me
have
some
beans
i
cried
i
was
hungry
as
could
be
sure
he
wearily
replied
shall
i
give
you
two
or
three
beans
he
said
long
years
ago
of
rank
cheapness
were
the
signs
now
they
cost
three
scads
a
throw
and
you
do
not
get
the
vines
once
at
morn
i
wished
an
egg
and
the
landlord
had
a
swoon
with
his
head
soaked
in
a
keg
he
regained
his
mind
by
noon
once
he
moaned
an
egg
was
cheap
times
have
changed
alas
since
then
now
the
price
would
make
you
weep
and
they
do
throw
in
the
hen
omar
of
the
golden
pen
come
o
come
to
us
again
thy
and
thy
vine
with
thy
bread
and
jug
of
wine
seat
thyself
again
and
write
in
the
caustic
vein
or
light
thou
who
swatted
many
heads
tore
so
many
fakes
to
shreds
made
the
ancient
humbugs
hump
kept
the
wise
guys
on
the
jump
come
great
omar
from
the
mists
come
and
swat
thy
parodists
come
and
give
the
rhymesters
fits
all
the
jingling
wits
who
profane
thy
noble
verse
come
and
place
them
in
the
hearse
they
who
love
the
khayyam
strain
treasure
from
a
brain
satire
keen
as
tested
steel
they
who
love
old
omar
feel
that
the
imitative
crew
should
receive
the
wages
due
be
rewarded
for
their
toil
with
a
bath
in
boiling
oil
but
the
law
is
in
the
way
if
the
poets
we
should
slay
we
be
pulled
by
the
police
for
disturbance
of
the
peace
come
then
omar
from
the
shade
where
thou
hast
too
long
delayed
and
with
sundry
skillful
twists
wipe
out
all
those
parodists
it
all
very
well
to
be
nursing
a
grouch
when
everything
travels
awry
and
you
have
the
in
your
pouch
to
pay
for
a
cranberry
pie
it
all
very
well
to
use
language
galore
and
cover
your
whiskers
with
foam
you
may
prance
around
town
with
a
head
that
is
sore
but
beastly
to
carry
it
home
you
may
be
discouraged
and
worn
by
the
strife
then
make
all
your
kicks
on
the
street
for
the
man
who
will
wear
out
his
grouch
on
his
wife
is
fit
for
a
cannibal
meat
if
troubles
and
worries
are
beating
you
down
and
bringing
gray
hairs
to
your
dome
do
in
the
office
to
carry
a
frown
but
it
ghoulish
to
carry
it
home
the
lord
who
made
sparrows
and
katy
dids
loves
the
man
who
is
stalwart
and
brave
who
cheerily
goes
to
his
wife
and
his
kids
though
his
hopes
may
be
fit
for
the
grave
but
the
lord
has
no
use
for
the
skate
whose
courage
is
weak
as
the
foam
who
piles
up
his
sorrows
and
shoulders
the
weight
and
carefully
carries
it
home
i
glad
i
did
find
the
pole
up
there
where
arctic
billows
roll
when
first
i
heard
the
pole
was
lost
for
one
brief
day
my
wires
were
crossed
i
said
methinks
i
better
go
across
the
weary
wastes
of
snow
along
the
white
bear
lonely
track
and
find
the
pole
and
bring
it
back
thus
shall
i
scale
the
heights
of
fame
and
grow
sidewhiskers
on
my
name
i
be
a
bigger
man
than
taft
i
work
the
soft
chautauqua
graft
and
earn
a
package
of
long
green
by
writing
for
a
magazine
i
have
some
medals
in
my
trunk
and
silver
cups
and
other
junk
and
kings
and
queens
will
cry
with
pride
that
i
all
wool
and
three
yards
wide
so
let
me
hire
some
eskimos
and
hit
the
nice
cool
arctic
snows
but
here
my
granny
intervened
and
said
those
stovepipes
must
be
cleaned
you
have
mowed
the
lawn
this
week
and
it
a
sight
to
make
one
shriek
there
something
clogging
up
the
flue
you
ought
to
wash
the
buggy
too
and
there
are
forty
thousand
chores
and
here
you
stand
around
outdoors
and
mumble
like
a
heathen
turk
and
then
my
friends
i
got
to
work
long
life
to
you
and
holland
heir
wilhelmina
may
all
your
days
be
bright
and
fair
wilhelmina
and
may
the
babe
grow
wise
and
great
and
chic
and
slick
and
and
learn
to
keep
her
crown
on
straight
wilhelmina
o
bring
her
up
with
steady
hand
wilhelmina
and
train
her
mind
to
beat
the
band
wilhelmina
and
if
you
catch
her
chewing
gum
or
flirting
with
a
chum
then
take
a
strap
and
make
things
hum
wilhelmina
do
let
her
fool
away
her
time
wilhelmina
in
painting
or
in
writing
rhyme
wilhelmina
but
let
her
know
that
glory
lies
in
knowing
how
to
make
mince
pies
and
stews
and
roasts
and
fancy
fries
wilhelmina
and
if
by
worries
you
perplex
wilhelmina
and
know
what
you
should
do
next
wilhelmina
then
come
to
us
for
good
advice
we
always
keep
a
lot
on
ice
we
solve
your
problems
in
a
trice
wilhelmina
he
won
success
where
others
failed
he
built
a
weird
machine
composed
of
cranks
and
doodads
and
propelled
by
gasoline
that
circles
proudly
overhead
as
graceful
in
its
flight
as
any
eagle
that
cavorts
along
the
airy
height
when
wilbur
and
his
brother
bold
began
their
march
to
fame
the
sages
of
the
village
sneered
and
said
what
is
their
game
do
these
here
loonies
really
think
that
they
can
make
a
trap
of
iron
and
brass
and
canvas
things
and
junk
and
other
scrap
with
which
to
leave
the
solid
earth
and
plow
the
atmosphere
by
jings
it
is
safe
for
them
to
be
at
large
that
clear
but
wilbur
and
his
brother
bold
whose
courage
never
fails
kept
on
up
their
trap
with
wire
and
tin
and
nails
they
built
a
new
cafoozelum
improved
the
rinktyram
and
tinkered
up
the
doodlewhang
until
it
would
jam
and
then
one
morning
up
they
flew
and
all
the
village
seers
just
stood
around
and
pawed
the
ground
and
chewed
each
other
ears
good
luck
be
with
those
dayton
boys
good
luck
in
every
flight
it
is
a
pleasant
rite
to
write
that
wright
is
strictly
right
you
have
much
sense
but
i
love
you
well
o
broncho
of
mine
your
heart
is
hot
with
the
heat
of
hell
and
a
cyclone
in
your
spine
your
folly
grows
with
increasing
age
you
stand
by
the
pasture
bars
and
bare
your
teeth
in
a
dotard
rage
and
kick
at
the
smiling
stars
as
homely
you
as
the
face
of
sin
with
brands
on
your
mottled
flanks
and
saddle
scars
on
your
dusky
skin
and
burs
on
your
tail
and
shanks
and
old
so
old
that
the
men
are
dead
who
branded
your
neck
and
side
and
their
sons
have
lived
and
gone
to
bed
and
turned
to
the
wall
and
died
but
it
you
for
the
long
long
weary
trail
the
hills
and
the
desert
sand
by
the
side
of
the
bones
of
the
steeds
that
fail
and
perish
on
either
hand
it
you
for
the
steady
and
tireless
lope
through
canyon
or
mountain
pass
to
be
flogged
at
night
with
a
length
of
rope
and
be
fed
on
a
bunch
of
grass
illustration
then
i
float
away
away
to
moonlit
castles
in
there
is
no
tune
that
grips
my
heart
and
seems
to
pull
me
all
apart
like
this
old
serenade
it
seems
to
breathe
of
distant
lands
and
orange
groves
and
silver
sands
and
troubadour
and
maid
it
freighted
with
a
gentle
woe
as
old
as
all
the
seas
that
flow
as
young
as
yesterday
as
changeless
as
the
stars
above
as
yearning
as
a
woman
love
for
true
knight
far
away
it
seems
a
prayer
serene
and
pure
a
tale
of
love
that
will
endure
when
they
who
loved
are
dust
when
earthly
songs
are
heard
no
more
and
bridal
wreaths
are
withered
sore
and
wedding
rings
are
rust
it
weary
with
a
lover
care
it
wailing
with
a
deep
despair
that
only
lovers
learn
and
yet
through
all
its
sadness
grope
the
singing
messengers
of
hope
for
joys
that
will
return
o
gentle
soothing
serenade
when
i
am
beaten
down
and
frayed
with
all
my
hopes
in
pawn
when
i
forgotten
how
to
laugh
i
wind
up
my
old
phonograph
and
turn
the
music
on
and
then
i
float
away
away
to
moonlit
castles
in
cathay
or
araby
or
spain
and
underneath
the
glowing
skies
i
read
of
love
in
damsels
eyes
and
dream
and
dream
again
mazeppa
strapped
upon
a
steed
made
sixty
miles
at
frightful
speed
through
lowland
valley
and
morass
through
verdant
strips
of
garden
sass
mountain
brake
and
flowing
stream
he
sped
as
though
propelled
by
steam
the
bear
sat
up
to
see
him
go
the
wolves
pursued
but
had
no
show
and
when
at
last
he
reached
a
town
his
dying
charger
tumbled
down
mazeppa
rose
without
a
scratch
and
swiftly
wrote
a
long
dispatch
which
reached
the
sporting
ed
that
night
i
knocked
the
record
flat
all
right
no
other
fellow
anywhere
has
traveled
on
a
mare
sixty
miles
of
right
of
way
while
trussed
up
like
a
bale
of
hay
please
hire
a
hall
a
statement
write
that
i
will
lecture
every
night
for
twenty
years
my
lecture
fine
the
moving
picture
rights
are
mine
if
any
challenger
should
come
and
put
up
a
substantial
sum
and
say
that
he
be
glad
to
ride
upon
a
hearse
horse
tied
for
sixty
miles
or
maybe
more
for
money
marbles
chalk
or
gore
just
say
my
last
long
ride
is
made
until
the
lecture
graft
is
played
she
called
upon
her
lawyer
and
said
to
him
of
course
this
visit
will
surprise
you
i
want
a
nice
divorce
why
madam
cried
the
lawyer
you
talking
through
your
hat
your
husband
just
adores
you
and
all
the
town
knows
that
of
course
i
know
he
loves
me
she
answered
with
a
smile
but
that
will
cut
no
figure
divorces
are
in
style
decrees
were
won
in
triumph
by
friends
of
mine
of
late
and
every
time
i
meet
them
i
feel
so
out
of
date
i
just
come
from
a
party
the
swellest
of
the
town
i
felt
like
some
old
woman
who
wears
a
last
year
gown
and
all
the
ladies
chattered
of
husbands
in
their
string
decrees
of
separation
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
madam
said
the
lawyer
what
reasons
can
you
give
for
better
finer
husbands
than
yours
i
think
do
live
what
do
i
want
with
reasons
she
answered
in
a
huff
i
want
a
separation
and
that
should
be
enough
i
want
the
rare
distinction
a
court
of
justice
lends
i
feeling
too
among
my
lady
friends
i
must
have
some
good
reasons
i
do
not
think
you
nice
his
name
is
william
henry
that
surely
will
suffice
the
christmas
bells
again
ring
out
a
message
sweet
and
clear
and
harmony
is
round
about
and
happiness
is
near
so
let
us
all
sing
once
again
as
on
an
elder
day
god
rest
you
merry
gentlemen
let
nothing
you
dismay
forget
the
office
and
the
mart
the
hook
and
crook
and
loosen
up
your
withered
heart
as
well
as
pocketbook
forget
the
ledger
and
the
pen
and
watch
the
children
play
god
rest
you
merry
gentlemen
let
nothing
you
dismay
the
christmas
time
with
peace
is
fraught
from
strife
and
sorrow
free
and
every
wish
and
every
thought
should
kind
and
gentle
be
in
worlds
beyond
our
mortal
ken
this
is
a
holy
day
god
rest
you
merry
gentlemen
let
nothing
you
dismay
today
from
eden
plains
afar
the
shepherds
converse
hold
and
watch
again
the
risen
star
as
in
the
days
of
old
and
as
those
shepherds
watched
it
then
so
may
we
watch
today
god
rest
you
merry
gentlemen
let
nothing
you
dismay
the
tightwad
is
a
pleasant
soul
who
freezes
strongly
to
his
roll
until
he
has
any
his
bundle
colors
all
his
dreams
and
when
awake
full
of
schemes
to
nail
another
penny
he
counts
his
roubles
day
by
day
and
when
a
nickel
gets
away
it
nearly
drives
him
dotty
he
grovels
to
the
man
of
biz
who
has
a
bigger
roll
than
his
and
to
the
poor
haughty
all
things
upon
this
earth
are
trash
that
ca
be
bought
or
sold
for
cash
in
tightwad
estimation
the
summer
breeze
because
it
turns
the
cranks
of
mills
and
pumps
and
churns
receives
his
toleration
the
sun
is
useful
in
its
way
it
nourishes
the
wheat
and
hay
so
let
the
world
be
sunny
he
likes
to
hear
the
raindrops
slosh
they
help
the
pumpkin
beet
and
squash
and
such
things
sell
for
money
the
tightwad
often
is
a
bear
around
his
home
and
everywhere
and
people
hate
or
fear
him
since
kindness
has
no
market
price
it
waste
of
effort
to
be
nice
to
victims
who
are
near
him
methinks
that
when
the
tightwad
dies
and
to
his
retribution
flies
his
sentence
will
be
funny
they
load
him
with
a
silver
hat
and
boil
him
in
a
golden
vat
and
feed
him
money
my
sires
were
strong
heroic
men
who
fought
on
many
a
crimson
field
and
none
could
better
cut
a
throat
or
batter
down
a
foeman
shield
and
some
were
knighted
by
the
king
and
went
around
with
golden
spurs
which
must
have
been
a
nuisance
when
they
walked
among
the
cockleburs
their
sires
were
barons
of
the
rhine
who
worked
a
now
historic
graft
they
held
up
travelers
by
day
and
quaffed
their
sack
at
night
and
laughed
they
always
slept
upon
the
floor
and
never
shaved
or
cut
their
hair
they
pawed
their
victuals
with
their
hands
and
never
heard
of
underwear
their
sires
some
centuries
before
ran
naked
through
the
virgin
vales
distinguished
from
the
other
apes
because
they
had
any
tails
and
they
had
sires
still
farther
back
but
that
dim
past
is
veiled
to
me
and
so
i
fear
i
can
not
claim
a
really
flawless
pedigree
cave
when
the
cave
man
found
that
he
needed
grub
to
fill
out
the
bill
of
fare
he
went
out
doors
with
his
trusty
club
and
slaughtered
the
nearest
bear
and
thus
he
avoided
the
butcher
fake
of
selling
a
pound
of
bone
and
charging
it
up
as
the
sirloin
steak
that
you
ordered
by
telephone
the
cave
man
wore
as
his
sunday
best
the
skin
of
a
sheep
or
goat
and
a
peck
of
whiskers
on
his
breast
in
lieu
of
a
vest
or
coat
so
he
nothing
knew
of
the
tailor
knack
of
sewing
a
vest
all
wrong
and
making
a
coat
with
a
crooked
back
and
the
pants
half
a
foot
too
long
the
cave
man
swallowed
his
victuals
raw
as
he
sat
on
his
nice
mud
floor
and
his
only
tool
was
his
faithful
jaw
and
he
wanted
for
nothing
more
he
took
his
drinks
at
the
babbling
brook
and
healthy
and
gay
was
he
and
he
never
swore
at
the
bungling
cook
for
spoiling
the
pie
or
tea
alas
for
kipling
when
he
was
a
stripling
and
filled
with
the
fire
of
his
age
he
looked
like
a
dinger
the
singer
that
ever
wrote
rhymes
by
the
page
his
harpstrings
he
pounded
with
vim
till
they
sounded
like
strains
of
a
homeric
brand
and
people
in
wonder
inquired
who
in
thunder
was
filling
with
music
the
land
at
last
now
we
know
it
the
world
has
a
poet
who
set
all
the
rivers
afire
in
this
way
we
hailed
him
when
critics
assailed
him
and
knocked
on
his
bargain
sale
lyre
the
years
have
been
flying
and
old
bards
are
dying
and
some
of
the
young
have
been
called
and
rudyard
the
rhymer
is
now
an
old
timer
and
painfully
bald
and
harder
and
harder
with
counterfeit
ardor
he
whangs
at
his
lusty
old
lyre
it
kept
caterwauling
and
wailing
and
squalling
when
it
ought
to
be
flung
in
the
fire
o
hush
up
its
clangor
in
sorrow
not
anger
we
proffer
this
little
request
let
think
of
the
stripling
the
long
vanished
kipling
and
let
the
old
man
take
a
rest
that
hoosier
country
most
prolific
of
folks
who
scale
the
heights
of
fame
excelling
in
the
arts
pacific
they
give
their
state

lustrous

truest
glory

ought
to
be
ashamed
colonel
at
oh
tumbo
bwana
tumbo
we
are
glad
you
back
again
with
the
lion
that
you
slaughtered
in
its
cheap
but
useful
den
with
your
crates
of
anacondas
and
your
sack
of
crocodiles
we
are
glad
indeed
to
see
you
and
the
land
is
wreathed
in
smiles
for
we
missed
you
bwana
tumbo
when
you
roamed
the
distant
field
killing
camels
with
the
weapon
that
no
other
man
could
wield
and
the
rust
of
peace
was
on
us
and
our
martial
spirits
fell
and
our
lives
grew
stale
and
stagnant
and
we
got
too
fat
to
yell
oh
the
land
was
like
a
homestead
when
the
boss
is
gone
away
when
the
women
sit
and
mumble
and
the
kids
refuse
to
play
but
with
us
now
tumbo
with
the
skins
of
beasts
you
slew
with
the
bones
of
bear
and
walrus
and
the
stately
kangaroo
and
the
gloom
has
left
the
shanty
and
we
moon
around
no
more
for
the
colonel
quit
his
hunting
and
his
face
is
at
the
door
june
here
she
comes
and
she
a
sight
in
her
gown
of
snowy
white
thing
of
beauty
and
of
charm
leaning
on
her
lover
arm
bright
her
eyes
as
summer
skies
and
a
glory
in
them
lies
borrowed
from
the
realms
above
where
the
only
light
is
love
and
her
lover
looks
serene
shaven
perfumed
groomed
and
clean
pride
is
glowing
in
his
eyes
that
he
won
so
fair
a
prize
lover
lover
do
your
best
to
wound
that
gentle
breast
lover
never
bring
a
smart
to
that
true
and
trusting
heart
strive
to
earn
the
love
you
won
as
the
years
their
courses
run
knowing
ever
as
you
strive
that
no
man
who
is
alive
and
no
man
since
adam
died
deserved
a
fair
june
bride
the
i
went
last
night
to
see
the
play
a
drama
of
the
modern
kind
and
i
am
feeling
tired
today
i
like
to
fumigate
my
mind
i
hate
to
always
recollect
those
tawdry
jokes
and
vicious
cracks
for
i
would
fain
be
circumspect
and
keep
my
brain
as
clean
as
wax
the
playwright
did
his
best
to
show
that
married
life
is
flat
and
stale
that
homely
virtues
are
too
slow
to
prosper
in
this
earthly
vale
he
put
deceit
on
dress
parade
and
put
a
laurel
crown
on
vice
and
honor
saw
her
trophies
fade
and
truth
was
laid
upon
the
ice
it
held
the
mirror
up
to
life
and
i
who
saw
it
homeward
went
and
got
a
club
and
beat
my
wife
and
robbed
an
orphan
of
a
cent
if
i
saw
many
plays
so
rank
so
full
of
dark
and
evil
thought
i
steal
a
blind
man
savings
bank
or
swipe
a
house
and
lot
you
may
be
lustrous
as
a
star
with
all
the
virtues
in
you
canned
but
if
you
fool
around
with
tar
you
blacken
up
to
beat
the
band
you
may
be
wholesome
as
the
breeze
that
chortles
through
a
country
lane
but
if
you
eat
limburger
cheese
your
friends
will
pass
you
with
disdain
and
every
time
you
see
a
play
or
read
a
book
that
makes
a
jest
of
love
and
home
you
throw
away
some
part
of
you
that
was
the
best
day
now
my
wife
is
reading
papers
on
the
fall
of
ancient
rome
and
i
find
myself
her
husband
doing
all
the
work
at
home
i
have
washed
the
dinner
dishes
i
have
swept
the
kitchen
floor
and
i
pretty
near
decided
that
i
do
it
never
more
for
the
soap
gets
in
my
whiskers
and
the
grease
gets
on
my
clothes
and
i
always
dropping
dishes
and
big
sadirons
on
my
toes
and
i
can
not
herd
the
children
while
i
scrubbing
very
well
two
have
vanished
in
the
distance
three
have
fallen
in
the
well
and
i
always
using
coal
oil
where
i
should
use
gasoline
so
the
stove
is
blown
to
pieces
and
the
roof
has
holes
i
ween
and
the
neighbors
come
and
chaff
me
laugh
like
horses
at
the
door
as
i
slop
around
in
sorrow
wiping
gravy
from
the
floor
so
methinks
i
ask
the
missus
after
this
to
run
our
home
and
i
do
a
stunt
of
reading
papers
on
the
fall
of
rome
illustration
some
lone
mountain
in
the
starry
like
some
lone
mountain
in
the
starry
night
lifting
its
head
severely
white
into
the
silence
of
the
upper
air
serene
remote
and
always
changeless
there
firm
as
that
mountain
in
the
day
of
dread
when
freedom
wept
and
pointed
to
her
dead
grim
as
that
mountain
to
the
ruthless
foe
wasting
the
land
that
wearied
of
its
woe
strong
as
that
mountain
his
load
of
care
when
brave
men
faltered
in
a
sick
despair
so
does
his
fame
like
that
lone
mountain
rise
cleaving
the
mists
and
reaching
to
the
skies
bright
as
the
beams
that
on
its
summit
glow
firm
as
its
rocks
and
stainless
as
its
snow
and
every
hour
that
gone
a
dead
one
and
another
comes
and
goes
in
the
graveyard
of
the
ages
hours
will
find
their
last
repose
and
the
hour
that
come
and
vanished
never
can
be
used
again
you
may
long
to
live
it
over
but
the
longing
is
in
vain
lasso
then
the
hour
that
with
you
ride
it
till
its
back
is
sore
you
can
have
it
sixty
minutes
sixty
minutes
and
no
more
make
it
earn
its
board
and
lodging
make
it
haul
your
private
wain
for
when
once
it
slips
its
halter
it
will
never
work
again
so
the
hours
like
spotted
ponies
trot
along
in
single
file
and
we
have
sense
to
catch
them
and
to
work
them
for
a
mile
we
just
loaf
around
and
watch
them
sitting
idly
in
the
sun
and
the
darkness
comes
and
finds
us
with
but
mighty
little
done
we
always
glad
when
he
drops
in
the
pilgrim
with
the
cheerful
grin
who
wo
admit
that
grief
and
sin
are
in
possession
there
are
so
many
here
below
who
coax
their
briny
tears
to
flow
and
talk
forevermore
of
woe
with
no
digression
the
man
who
takes
the
cheerful
view
has
friends
to
burn
and
then
a
few
they
like
to
hear
his
glad
halloo
and
loud
they
like
to
hear
him
blithely
swear
that
things
are
right
side
up
with
care
they
like
to
hear
upon
the
air
his
the
long
felt
want
he
amply
fills
he
is
a
tonic
for
the
ills
that
be
reached
with
liver
pills
or
porous
plasters
he
helps
to
make
the
desert
bloom
he
plants
the
grouches
in
the
tomb
he
here
to
dissipate
the
gloom
of
life
disasters
few
i
gaily
sought
the
picnic
ground
where
children
sported
in
the
shade
with
them
i
frolicked
round
and
round
and
drank
with
them
red
lemonade
and
life
seemed
very
full
and
sweet
as
joyous
as
the
song
of
larks
until
a
guy
got
on
his
feet
and
said
he
make
a
few
remarks
i
journeyed
to
the
county
fair
to
view
the
products
of
the
farm
i
marveled
at
the
pumpkins
there
and
carrots
longer
than
your
arm
and
happiness
was
over
all
there
was
no
sign
of
care
that
carks
until
a
man
with
lots
of
gall
got
up
to
make
a
few
remarks
oh
i
was
born
for
joy
and
glee
to
sing
as
blithely
as
the
birds
my
life
that
should
so
sunny
be
is
darkened
by
a
cloud
of
words
and
when
my
prospects
seem
most
fair
and
trouble
for
its
bourne
embarks
some
windy
jim
is
always
there
to
rise
and
make
a
few
remarks
little
drops
of
water
poured
into
the
milk
give
the
milkman
daughters
lovely
gowns
of
silk
little
grains
of
sugar
mingled
with
the
sand
make
the
grocer
assets
swell
to
beat
the
band
little
bowls
of
custard
humble
though
they
seem
help
enrich
the
fellow
selling
pure
ice
cream
little
rocks
and
boulders
little
chunks
of
slate
make
the
coal
man
fortune
something
fierce
and
great
little
ads
well
written
printed
nice
and
neat
give
the
joyful
merchants
homes
on
easy
street
when
the
home
team
loses
a
well
fought
game
it
causes
a
lot
of
woe
but
nothing
is
ever
gained
my
friends
by
laying
the
umpire
low
far
better
to
let
him
fade
away
and
die
of
his
soul
remorse
than
to
muss
the
diamond
with
his
remains
or
sit
on
his
pulseless
corpse
when
i
was
younger
i
always
slew
the
umpire
whose
work
was
bum
and
now
when
i
go
to
my
downy
couch
the
ghosts
of
the
umpires
come
and
moan
and
gibber
around
my
bed
and
rattle
their
fleshless
bones
and
call
me
names
of
the
rankest
kind
in
their
deep
sepulchral
tones
i
always
found
when
an
umpire
died
and
rode
in
the
village
hearse
that
the
fellow
who
came
to
take
his
place
was
sure
to
be
ten
times
worse
the
great
detective
had
returned
he
been
some
years
away
and
i
supposed
that
he
was
dead
and
sleeping
the
clay
ah
shall
i
forget
the
joy
it
gave
me
thus
to
greet
the
king
of
all
detectives
in
my
rooms
in
baker
street
i
notice
watson
sherlock
said
with
smile
serene
and
wide
that
since
i
left
you
months
ago
you
found
yourself
a
bride
i
had
not
spoken
of
the
fact
so
how
did
sherlock
know
i
tumbled
from
my
rockingchair
his
knowledge
jarred
me
so
easy
watson
said
the
sleuth
deduction
makes
it
plain
you
ate
an
egg
for
breakfast
and
your
chin
still
wears
the
stain
you
shaved
for
half
a
week
the
stubble
growing
blue
your
pants
are
baggy
at
the
knees
your
necktie
on
askew
your
vest
is
buttoned
crooked
and
your
shirt
is
out
of
plumb
your
hat
has
been
in
contact
with
a
wad
of
chewing
gum
you
were
something
of
a
dandy
in
the
good
old
days
of
yore
pass
the
dope
my
dearest
watson
what
the
use
of
saying
more
i
do
not
like
the
man
who
searches
his
mind
for
caustic
things
to
say
about
the
preachers
and
the
churches
he
grows
more
common
every
day
the
cynic
is
a
scurvy
tutor
whose
head
and
creed
are
made
of
wood
he
puts
up
little
gods
of
pewter
and
says
that
they
are
just
as
good
he
thinks
that
triumphs
he
is
winning
and
he
emits
a
joyous
laugh
if
he
can
knock
the
underpinning
from
faith
that
is
our
rod
and
staff
he
is
a
poor
and
tawdry
victor
who
would
dead
religions
walk
the
church
still
lives
though
fools
have
kicked
her
since
first
she
builded
on
a
rock
i
hear
the
mellow
church
bells
ringing
a
welcome
to
that
calm
retreat
i
hear
the
choir
sweet
voices
singing
an
anthem
reverent
and
sweet
and
well
i
know
the
gentle
pastor
is
pointing
out
the
path
to
wend
and
urging
men
to
let
the
master
be
evermore
their
guide
and
friend
and
he
like
all
good
men
is
reaching
for
better
and
for
higher
things
and
so
the
message
of
his
preaching
unlike
the
cynic
comfort
brings
newspaper
beneath
the
stones
they
sweetly
sleep
the
humble
toilers
of
the
press
no
more
to
sorrow
or
to
weep
no
more
to
labor
in
distress
here
lies
a
youth
upon
whose
tomb
the
tear
of
pity
often
drops
we
had
to
send
him
to
his
doom
because
he
wrote
of
bumper
crops
here
sleeps
the
golden
years
away
the
fairest
of
the
human
tribe
we
slew
him
at
the
break
of
day
because
he
called
himself
ye
scribe
beneath
that
yew
another
sleeps
who
did
his
work
with
smiling
lips
we
had
to
put
him
out
for
keeps
when
he
referred
to
flying
trips
and
one
the
noblest
of
them
all
is
resting
on
the
windswept
hill
in
writing
up
a
game
of
ball
he
spoke
of
one
who
hit
the
pill
hard
by
the
wall
where
roses
bloom
and
breezes
sway
the
clinging
vines
that
youth
is
sleeping
in
his
tomb
who
used
the
phrase
along
these
lines
today
the
sexton
wields
his
spade
and
digs
a
grave
both
deep
and
wide
where
soon
the
stripling
will
be
laid
who
wrote
about
the
blushing
bride
lady
she
walks
in
beauty
like
the
night
as
some
romantic
singer
said
her
eyes
give
forth
a
starry
light
her
lips
are
of
a
cherry
red
across
the
floor
she
seems
to
float
she
seems
to
me
beyond
compare
a
being
perfect
till
i
note
the
way
that
she
done
up
her
hair
she
must
have
toiled
a
half
a
day
to
build
that
large
unwieldy
mass
she
must
have
used
a
bale
of
hay
and
strips
of
tin
and
wire
of
brass
her
sisters
must
have
helped
to
braid
her
mother
wrought
and
tinkered
there
and
butler
cook
and
chambermaid
all
helped
to
wrestle
with
her
hair
and
after
all
the
grinding
toil
and
all
the
braiding
and
the
fuss
the
one
effect
is
just
to
spoil
her
beauty
and
make
people
cuss
she
walks
in
beauty
like
the
night
where
nights
are
most
serenely
fair
but
caesar
she
a
sight
when
she
got
on
her
sunday
hair
sick
i
can
not
sing
today
my
dear
about
your
locks
of
gold
for
my
fat
head
is
feeling
queer
since
i
have
caught
a
cold
and
when
a
bard
is
feeling
off
and
full
of
pills
and
care
and
has
to
sit
around
and
cough
he
sours
on
golden
hair
i
can
not
sing
today
dear
heart
about
your
coral
lips
the
doctor
coming
in
his
cart
he
making
daily
trips
he
makes
me
sit
in
scalding
steam
with
blankets
loaded
down
and
people
say
they
hear
me
scream
half
way
across
the
town
he
makes
me
swallow
slippery
elm
and
ink
and
moldy
paste
and
blithely
hunts
throughout
the
realm
for
things
with
bitter
taste
i
can
not
sing
today
my
love
about
your
swanlike
neck
for
i
am
sitting
by
the
stove
a
grim
and
ghastly
wreck
and
many
poultices
anoint
the
summit
of
my
head
i
coughed
my
ribs
all
out
of
joint
and
i
am
largely
dead
and
so
the
mention
of
a
harp
just
makes
my
blood
run
cold
some
other
blooming
poet
sharp
must
sing
your
locks
of
gold
some
other
troubadour
my
sweet
must
sing
to
you
instead
for
i
have
earache
in
my
feet
and
chilblains
in
my
head
he
had
a
little
organ
there
the
which
i
watched
him
grind
and
oft
he
cried
as
in
despair
please
help
me
i
am
blind
i
muttered
as
his
music
rose
he
plays
in
frightful
luck
and
then
i
went
down
in
my
clothes
and
gave
him
half
a
buck
a
friend
came
rushing
up
just
then
and
said
you
make
me
ache
you
are
the
easiest
of
men
that
beggar
is
a
fake
the
fraud
has
money
salted
down
more
than
you
ever
earn
he
owns
a
business
block
in
town
and
he
has
farms
to
burn
i
answered
though
the
beggar
own
a
bankroll
large
and
fat
i
do
regret
the
half
a
bone
i
threw
into
his
hat
i
see
a
man
who
looks
as
though
the
world
had
used
him
bad
it
sets
my
jaded
heart
aglow
to
give
him
half
a
scad
and
though
that
beggar
man
may
be
the
worst
old
fraud
about
that
makes
no
sort
of
odds
to
me
that
is
my
lookout
i
stake
tom
harry
dick
or
jack
he
comes
my
way
my
conscience
pats
me
on
the
back
and
says
that
i
but
if
a
busted
pilgrim
came
to
work
me
in
distress
and
i
inquired
his
age
and
name
his
pastor
street
address
and
asked
to
see
the
documents
to
prove
he
told
no
lies
before
i
loosened
up
ten
cents
my
conscience
would
arise
and
prod
me
till
i
could
sleep
or
eat
a
grown
man
meal
and
so
the
beggar
man
may
keep
that
section
of
a
wheel
i
like
to
think
that
when
i
dead
my
restless
soul
unchained
the
things
that
worry
my
fat
head
will
then
all
be
explained
this
fact
a
lot
of
sorrow
brings
throughout
this
weary
land
there
are
so
many
many
things
we
do
not
understand
oh
why
is
virtue
oft
oppressed
and
scourged
and
beaten
down
while
vice
with
gems
of
east
and
west
is
flaunting
through
the
town
and
why
is
childhood
face
with
tears
of
sorrow
often
stained
when
i
have
reached
the
shining
spheres
these
things
will
be
explained
why
does
the
poor
man
go
to
jail
because
he
steals
a
trout
while
wealthy
men
who
steal
a
whale
quite
easily
stay
out
why
does
affliction
dog
the
man
who
earns
two
bones
a
day
who
though
he
try
the
best
he
can
ca
drive
the
wolf
away
why
does
the
weary
woman
sew
to
earn
a
pauper
gain
while
scores
of
gaudy
spendthrifts
blow
their
wealth
for
dry
champagne
why
do
we
send
the
shining
buck
to
heathen
in
cathay
while
in
the
squalid
alley
muck
white
feet
have
gone
astray
such
questions
in
a
motley
crowd
at
my
poor
mind
have
strained
but
when
i
sit
upon
a
cloud
these
things
will
be
explained
depot
the
railway
station
in
our
town
is
seedy
commonplace
and
plain
yet
scores
of
people
rustle
down
and
gather
there
to
meet
each
train
the
waiting
room
is
bleak
and
bare
a
place
of
din
yet
fifty
loafers
gather
there
each
day
to
see
the
train
come
in
the
station
agent
life
is
sad
the
loafers
made
it
grim
and
gray
they
drive
the
poor
man
nearly
mad
for
they
are
always
in
the
way
the
passengers
can
only
sob
as
they
their
townward
way
begin
for
they
must
struggle
through
the
mob
that
there
to
see
the
train
come
in
the
men
who
have
their
work
to
do
are
hindered
in
a
hundred
ways
in
vain
they
weep
and
cry
out
shoo
they
ca
disperse
the
loafing
jays
these
loafers
always
are
the
same
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
they
have
no
other
end
or
aim
than
just
to
see
the
train
come
in
i
traveled
east
i
traveled
west
and
every
station
in
the
land
appears
to
have
its
loaferfest
its
lazy
idle
useless
band
i
know
the
station
loafer
well
he
has
red
stubble
on
his
chin
he
has
an
ancient
fishlike
smell
he
lives
to
see
the
train
come
in
oh
osler
get
your
chloroform
and
fill
your
glass
syringe
again
and
come
and
try
to
make
things
warm
for
those
who
bother
busy
men
for
loafers
standing
in
the
way
when
standing
is
a
yellow
sin
for
those
who
gather
day
by
day
to
see
a
train
come
in
foolish
he
toiled
and
sweated
half
his
life
to
hang
rich
garments
on
his
wife
i
have
time
to
cut
a
dash
he
said
but
i
will
blow
the
cash
to
let
those
neighbors
know
that
i
have
got
the
cash
to
blow
and
so
his
good
wife
wore
her
furs
and
dress
parade
was
always
hers
she
had
her
gems
from
near
and
far
and
glittered
like
an
she
had
a
new
and
wondrous
gown
for
every
function
in
the
town
her
life
seemed
sunny
gay
and
glad
this
wife
who
was
her
husband
ad
one
night
his
day
of
labor
he
found
her
weeping
at
the
door
and
when
he
asked
her
to
explain
she
stopped
a
while
the
briny
rain
and
cried
this
life
my
spirit
fags
i
tired
of
wearing
flossy
rags
i
tired
of
chasing
through
the
town
a
dummy
in
a
costly
gown
i
rather
wear
a
burlap
sack
or
leather
flynet
on
my
back
and
have
you
with
me
as
of
yore
than
all
the
sables
in
the
store
and
if
you
really
love
your
wife
you
get
back
to
the
simple
life
do
try
to
gather
all
the
dough
that
minted
in
this
world
below
just
earn
enough
to
pay
the
freight
and
let
us
live
in
simple
state
in
some
neat
shanty
far
away
from
pomp
and
fuss
and
vain
display
some
hut
among
the
cockleburs
remote
from
jewelry
and
furs
illustration
will
be
boys
tonight
the
boys
will
take
the
town
and
doubtless
turn
it
upside
down
they
sport
around
with
joyous
zest
and
knock
the
landscape
galley
west
and
when
the
morning
comes
i
see
my
buggy
in
an
apple
tree
the
sidewalk
piled
upon
the
lawn
the
hens
with
all
their
feathers
gone
i
hear
my
trusty
milkcow
yell
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
while
dobbin
stands
upon
the
roof
and
waves
for
help
a
frantic
hoof
last
year
the
boys
wrought
while
i
slept
and
in
the
morn
i
screamed
and
wept
when
looking
at
the
work
they
done
i
said
next
year
i
get
a
gun
and
watch
for
these
michievous
souls
and
shoot
the
darlings
full
of
holes
but
granny
heard
me
and
she
said
while
water
cheap
go
soak
your
head
you
once
were
young
yourself
by
george
and
people
voted
you
a
scourge
you
played
so
many
fiendish
tricks
you
filled
so
many
hats
with
bricks
that
terror
came
to
every
one
when
you
went
forth
to
have
some
fun
the
village
pastor
used
to
say
that
young
rascal
comes
my
way
i
always
beat
a
swift
retreat
i
rather
have
the
prickly
heat
and
so
i
have
bought
a
gun
and
so
the
boys
may
have
their
fun
and
if
the
morning
should
disclose
the
chimney
filled
with
garden
hose
the
watchdog
painted
green
and
brown
the
henhouse
standing
upside
down
i
make
no
melancholy
noise
but
say
boys
durn
will
be
boys
to
the

stood
erect
and
having
seen
that
artists
for
some
magazine
had
sketched
him
in
his
proper
pose
he
cleared
his
throat
and
blew
his
nose
and
said
hi
romans
you
are
slaves
you
not
the
price
to
buy
your
shaves
the
good
old
sun
still
on
the
turf
and
his
last
beam
falls
on
a

great

my
friends
is

dead
o
whence
and
whither
do
we
tread
i
view
the
future
with
alarm
we
tremble
the
tyrant
arm
and
ye
may
tremble
sons
of
rome
until
the
muley
cows
come
home
but
you
will
still
be
in
the
hole
unless
some
fiery
dauntless
soul
like
me
shall
lead
you
from
the
wreck
and
soak
the
tyrant
in
the
neck
and
here
i
stand
to
cut
the
ice

ready
for
the
sacrifice
i
save
you
if
a
roman
can

candidate
for
councilman

ask
your
votes
and
if
i
win

swat
the
tyrant
on
the
chin

the
fourteenth
ward
and
represent
it
good
and
hard
and
drive
the
grafters
from
their
place
and
kick
the
tyrant
in
the
face

our

pleasant
day

round
a
stack
of
hay
and
kicked
its
heels
and
pawed
the
land
and
reared
and
jumped
to
beat
the
band
the
older
horses

around
and
swallowed
fodder
by
the
pound
and
gave
no
notice
to
the
kid

gaily
round
the
haystack
slid

loafed
along
and

were
as
mean
as
men
some
old
gray
workhorse
stiff
and
sour
would
jaw
that
colt
for
half
an
hour
methinks
i
hear
that
workhorse
say
think
you
mighty
smooth
and
gay
and
you
are
fresh
and
sporty
now
but
when
they
hitch
you
to
the
plow
and
strap
a
harness
on
your
back
and
work
you
till
your
innards
crack
and
kick
you
when
you
want
to
balk
and
slug
you
with
a
chunk
of
rock
and
cover
you
with
nasty
sores
and
leave
you
freezing
out
of
doors
o
then
you
wo
kick
up
your
heels
know
then
how
a
workhorse
feels
but
horses
have
no
croaking
voice
to
chill
the
colt
that
would
rejoice
no
graybeard
plug
will
leave
its
feed
to
make
the
heart
of
childhood
bleed
no
dismal
prophecies
are
heard
no
moral
homilies
absurd
where
horses
stand
and
eat
their
hay
and
so
the
colts
may
run
and
play
and
good
old
opulent
john
he
would
look
with
scorn
on
me
i
consider
in
luck
when
i
have
an
extra
buck
buying
ice
or
buying
coal
always
keeps
me
in
the
hole
and
when
i
have
paid
the
rent
i
am
left
without
a
cent
yet
i
always
gay
and
snug
happy
as
a
tumblebug
having
still
the
best
of
times
grinding
out
my
blame
fool
rhymes
old
john
on
hand
frets
away
to
beat
the
band
he
is
burdened
with
his
care
though
he
is
with
his
hair
and
his
health
is
going
back
and
his
liver
out
of
whack
and
his
conscience
has
grown
numb
and
his
wishbone
out
of
plumb
and
he
trembling
all
the
day
lest
a
plunk
may
get
away
better
be
a
cornfed
bard
writing
lyrics
by
the
yard
with
an
appetite
so
gay
it
wo
balk
at
prairie
hay
than
to
have
a
mighty
pile
and
forget
the
way
to
smile
order
i
bought
me
a
suit
of
the
brand
they
said
it
was
tailored
and
sewed
by
hand
they
said
it
was
woven
of
finest
wool
and
be
torn
by
an
angry
bull
they
said
it
was
fine
and
would
surely
last
till
gabriel
tooteth
the
final
blast
it
was
ten
cents
cheaper
than
suits
i
bought
from
local
dealers
who
seemed
quite
hot
and
shed
a
bucket
of
briny
tears
when
i
bought
my
clothes
of
the
sawbuck
rears
i
wore
that
suit
when
the
day
was
damp
and
it
shrunk
to
the
size
of
a
postage
stamp
the
coat
split
up
and
the
vest
split
down
and
i
scared
the
horses
all
over
town
for
the
buttons
popped
and
the
seams
they
tore
and
the
stiches
gave
with
a
sullen
roar
and
i
gave
that
suit
to
a
maiden
small
who
found
it
handy
to
dress
her
doll
life
little
day
is
fading
fast
upon
the
mountain
brow
the
sinking
sun
is
gleaming
red
the
shadows
lengthen
now
the
twilight
hush
comes
on
apace
and
soon
the
evening
star
will
light
us
to
those
chambers
dim
where
dreamless
sleepers
are
and
when
the
curfew
bell
is
rung
that
calls
us
all
to
rest
and
we
have
left
all
worldly
things
at
behest
o
may
some
truthful
mourner
rise
and
say
of
you
or
me
gee
whiz
i
sorry
that
he
dead
he
was
a
honey
bee
his
job
he
did
his
best
he
put
on
all
his
steam
in
every
stunt
he
had
to
do
he
was
a
team
he
thought
that
man
was
placed
on
earth
to
help
his
fellowguys
he
never
wore
a
frosty
face
and
balked
at
weeping
eyes
the
hard
luck
pilgrim
always
got
a
handout
at
his
door
and
any
friend
could
help
himself
to
all
he
had
in
store
he
tried
to
make
his
humble
home
the
gayest
sort
of
camp
till
death
the
king
of
bogies
came
and
slugged
him
in
the
lamp
i
do
believe
a
squarer
guy
existed
in
the
land
and
death
was
surely
off
his
base
when
this
galoot
was
canned
all
come
the
stars
will
come
back
to
the
azure
vault
when
the
clouds
are
all
blown
away
and
the
sun
will
come
back
when
the
night
is
done
and
give
us
another
day
the
cows
will
come
back
from
the
meadows
lush
and
the
birds
to
their
trysting
tree
but
the
money
i
paid
to
a
mining
shark
will
never
come
back
to
me
the
leaves
will
come
back
to
the
naked
boughs
and
the
flowers
to
the
frosty
brae
the
spring
will
come
back
like
a
blooming
bride
and
the
breezes
that
blow
in
may
and
the
joy
will
come
back
to
the
stricken
heart
and
laughter
and
hope
and
glee
but
the
money
i
blew
for
some
mining
stock
will
never
come
back
to
me
cussing
the
jackal
is
a
beastly
beast
and
when
it
hankers
for
a
feast
it
has
no
use
for
nice
fresh
meat
the
fool
would
rather
eat
some
animal
that
died
last
year
and
so
the
jackal
far
and
near
is
shunned
by
brutes
and
slugged
with
rocks
and
bricks
and
boots
and
men
whose
language
is
decayed
who
make
profanity
a
trade
are
like
the
jackal
of
the
wild
that
hunts
around
for
things
defiled
in
all
your
rounds
you
never
find
a
healthy
clean
and
gentle
mind
possessed
by
any
son
of
wrath
whose
language
needs
a
turkish
bath
on
great
occasions
there
excuse
for
turning
loose
the
father
of
his
country
swore
at
monmouth
and
then
cussed
some
more
that
patient
soul
the
man
of
uz
with
boils
so
thick
he
could
buzz
ripped
off
some
language
rich
and
brown
until
old
bildad
called
him
down
great
men
beneath
some
awful
stroke
let
loose
remarks
that
fairly
smoke
and
we
forgive
them
as
we
write
the
story
of
their
deeds
of
might
but
little
men
who
swear
and
swear
and
thus
pollute
our
common
air
are
foul
and
foolish
as
the
frogs
that
trumpet
in
their
native
bogs
john
bull
looks
forth
upon
the
main
and
heaves
a
sigh
as
though
in
pain
he
wipes
away
the
tears
and
cries
in
sorrow
blawst
my
blooming
eyes
there
fungus
growing
on
my
realm
i
need
a
hustler
at
the
helm
these
once
progressive
british
isles
are
left
behind
a
million
miles
it
was
a
blamed
italian
chap
that
made
that
wireless
message
trap
a
frenchman
made
the
whole
world
blink
by
flying
safely
the
drink
a
dutchman
built
a
big
balloon
in
which
he
journey
to
the
moon
and
now
i
told
lud
bless
my
soul
a
yankee
gone
and
found
the
pole
have
britons
lost
their
steam
and
vim
are
we
no
longer
in
the
swim
are
we
content
to
tag
behind
and
trust
in
fate
and
go
it
blind
is
this
our
england
lying
dead
with
candles
at
her
feet
and
head
has
genius
torn
her
robe
and
died
and
have
we
naught
to
brace
our
pride
a
voice
comes
sighing
the
land
a
voice
john
bull
can
understand
a
female
voice
that
bright
and
gay
and
in
his
ears
it
seems
to
say
cheer
up
the
gods
are
with
you
yet
you
always
have
the
suffragette
we
making
laws
with
lots
of
noise
to
keep
from
harm
our
precious
boys
the
curfew
bell
booms
out
at
eight
and
warns
the
lads
to
pull
their
freight
for
home
and
bed
and
balmy
sleep
while
wary
cops
their
vigils
keep
the
cheap
toy
pistol
down
and
out
we
wo
have
things
like
that
about
and
boys
who
hear
the
pistol
toot
must
sit
and
watch
their
parents
shoot
the
cigarette
at
last
is
canned
the
children
of
this
happy
land
can
buy
such
no
more
which
sometimes
makes
the
darlings
sore
each
year
new
laws
and
statutes
brings
to
shield
them
from
corrupting
things
it
strange
that
we
should
overlook
the
screaming
book
the
wild
and
wooly
yarn
that
johnnie
reads
behind
the
barn
the
tales
of
bandits
who
have
slain
a
cord
of
men
and
robbed
a
train
of
thieves
who
break
away
from
jail
with
punk
detectives
on
their
trail
of
long
haired
scouts
and
men
of
wrath
who
nothing
fear
except
a
bath
such
yarns
as
these
our
johnnie
reads
they
brace
him
up
for
bloody
deeds
and
when
he
can
he
takes
the
trail
and
ends
his
bright
career
in
jail
so
while
we
swatting
evil
things
and
putting
little
boys
on
wings
let
swat
the
book
that
leaves
a
stain
upon
the
reader
soul
and
brain
he
had
journeyed
sore
and
weary
over
deserts
wide
and
dreary
through
the
snows
of
far
sibery
he
had
dragged
his
frozen
form
he
had
searched
the
site
of
eden
been
through
kansas
wild
and
bleedin
in
the
hills
of
sweden
he
had
faced
the
winter
storm
in
the
vain
pursuit
of
glory
hoping
he
would
live
in
story
he
had
hoofed
it
to
empory
from
toronto
on
the
lake
he
had
heard
land
agents
rattle
through
the
suburbs
of
seattle
he
had
seen
the
creek
of
battle
where
they
live
on
sawdust
cake
fate
was
kind
and
just
to
prove
her
he
had
journeyed
to
vancouver
where
the
emigrant
and
mover
pitch
their
tents
upon
the
street
he
had
roamed
the
broad
savannah
he
had
voted
in
montana
hunting
with
the
mighty
bwana
afric
jungles
knew
his
feet
he
had
sung
the
boomer
ditty
down
in
oklahoma
city
thinking
it
a
blooming
pity
that
the
town
had
such
a
name
he
had
mined
in
cold
alaska
farmed
with
bryan
in
nebraska
and
was
never
known
to
ask
a
least
advantage
in
the
game
to
his
native
town
returning
all
reporters
there
were
yearning
to
receive
a
statement
burning
from
this
calm
intrepid
soul
not
of
fights
or
sieges
gory
was
the
hero
simple
story
i
have
but
one
claim
to
glory
i
have
never
found
the
pole
saturday
night
and
the
week
work
done
and
the
old
man
home
with
a
bunch
of
mon
you
see
him
sit
on
the
cottage
porch
and
he
puffs
away
at
a
torch
while
the
good
wife
sings
at
her
evening
chores
and
the
children
gambol
around
outdoors
the
old
man
sits
on
his
hat
and
he
does
envy
the
plutocrat
his
debts
are
paid
and
he
owns
his
place
and
he
look
a
king
in
the
blooming
face
his
hands
are
hard
with
the
brick
and
loam
but
his
heart
is
soft
with
the
love
of
home
saturday
night
and
it
time
for
bed
and
the
kids
come
in
with
a
buoyant
tread
and
they
hush
their
noise
at
the
mother
look
as
she
slowly
opens
a
heavy
book
and
reads
the
tale
of
the
stormy
sea
and
the
voice
that
quieted
galilee
then
away
to
bed
and
the
calm
repose
that
only
honesty
ever
knows
saturday
night
and
the
world
is
still
and
it
only
the
erring
who
finds
things
ill
there
is
sweet
content
and
a
sweeter
rest
where
a
good
heart
beats
in
a
brave
man
breast
smoking
is
a
filthy
habit
and
a
big
fat
black
cigar
advertises
that
you
straying
from
the
higher
life
afar
i
have
walked
in
summer
meadows
where
the
sunbeams
flashed
and
broke
and
i
never
saw
the
horses
or
the
sheep
or
cattle
smoke
i
have
watched
the
birds
with
wonder
when
the
world
with
dew
was
wet
and
i
never
saw
a
robin
puffing
at
a
cigarette
i
have
fished
in
many
rivers
when
the
sucker
crop
was
ripe
and
i
never
saw
a
catfish
pulling
at
a
briar
pipe
man
the
only
living
creature
that
parades
this
vale
of
tears
like
a
blooming
traction
engine
blowing
smoke
from
mouth
and
ears
if
dame
nature
had
intended
when
she
first
invented
man
that
he
smoke
she
would
have
built
him
on
a
widely
plan
she
have
fixed
him
with
a
damper
and
a
stovepipe
and
a
grate
he
have
had
a
smoke
consumer
that
was
strictly
therefore
let
the
erring
mortal
put
his
noisome
pipe
in
soak
he
can
always
get
a
new
one
if
he
feels
he
needs
a
smoke
illustration
come
my
love
from
your
bower
in
haste
let
us
trim
our
sails
for
the
ether
waste
away
away
o
come
my
love
for
the
world
at
rest
and
the
sun
asleep
in
the
curtained
west
and
the
night
breeze
sighs
from
between
the
stars
and
my
waits
by
your
window
bars
we
sail
the
sea
of
the
waveless
wind
we
leave
the
earth
and
its
dross
behind
and
watch
its
lights
from
the
cloudy
heights
o
come
my
love
on
this
best
of
nights
o
come
my
love
from
your
bower
in
haste
let
us
trim
our
sails
for
the
ether
waste
away
away
where
the
weary
moan
of
the
workday
world
is
never
known
where
the
only
track
is
the
track
of
wings
that
the
skylark
leaves
when
it
soars
and
sings
so
come
my
love
ere
the
night
is
old
and
the
stars
have
paled
and
the
dawn
is
cold
the
ship
ca
wait
for
its
precious
freight
for
it
costing
a
dollar
a
minute
straight
they
will
tinker
with
the
tariff
till
the
rivers
are
gone
dry
they
will
wrestle
with
the
subject
night
and
day
they
be
piling
up
the
language
when
the
snow
begins
to
fly
they
be
riddling
in
the
same
old
weary
way
o
the
grand
old
windy
wonders
who
adorn
the
senate
floor
till
the
windup
of
the
world
will
be
on
deck
and
there
just
one
thing
that
certain
that
is
sure
for
ever
more
the
consumer
always
gets
it
in
the
neck
there
is
talk
of
hides
and
leather
and
there
talk
of
nails
and
glue
there
are
weary
wads
of
twaddle
on
cement
and
the
man
from
buncombe
corners
stands
and
toots
his
loud
bazoo
till
his
language
in
the
ceiling
makes
a
dent
no
one
in
this
martyred
country
knows
how
long
this
will
endure
and
there
is
any
way
the
flood
to
check
and
there
just
one
thing
about
it
that
is
reasonably
sure
the
consumer
always
gets
it
in
the
neck
to
a
when
a
damsel
has
a
steady
who
a
pretty
decent
man
and
who
shows
a
disposition
to
perform
the
best
he
can
who
is
shy
of
sinful
habits
and
whose
bosom
holds
no
guile
and
who
labors
in
the
vineyard
with
a
gay
and
cheerful
smile
then
she
should
make
him
promise
that
he
do
a
seraph
stunt
when
they
stood
up
at
the
altar
with
the
in
front
and
she
should
spring
a
lecture
when
he
comes
around
to
court
for
a
man
is
only
human
and
his
wings
are
pretty
short
when
a
maiden
has
a
lover
who
is
surely
making
good
who
is
winning
admiration
who
is
sawing
lots
of
wood
then
she
should
make
him
promise
that
he
be
an
angel
boy
when
the
wedding
ceremony
ushers
in
a
life
of
joy
she
should
murmur
he
a
daisy
and
we
take
things
as
they
come
for
a
man
is
only
human
and
his
halo
on
the
bum
new
year
i
do
go
much
on
gilded
vows
for
i
have
made
them
in
the
past
and
they
are
with
the
they
were
too
good
to
last
and
so
i
make
one
vow
today
i
simply
try
to
do
my
best
that
vow
should
help
me
on
my
way
for
it
embraces
all
the
rest
i
take
the
middle
of
the
road
and
always
do
the
best
i
can
and
pack
along
my
little
load
and
try
to
be
a
manly
man
a
man
may
end
his
journey
here
too
poor
to
buy
a
decent
shroud
and
planted
be
without
a
tear
of
mourning
from
the
worldly
crowd
but
when
he
in
the
judgment
scale
he
come
triumphant
from
the
test
no
man
has
failed
no
man
can
fail
who
always
always
does
his
best
and
though
my
pathway
be
obscure
and
void
of
honor
and
applause
and
though
the
lean
wolf
of
the
moor
to
my
cheap
doorway
nearer
draws
i
keep
a
stout
heart
in
my
breast
and
follow
up
this
simple
plan
i
always
do
my
very
best
and
try
to
be
a
manly
man
stricken
he
labored
on
the
railway
track
his
task
would
break
a
horse
back
he
tugged
at
things
that
weighed
a
ton
and
all
the
time
the
summer
sun
blazed
down
and
cooked
him
where
he
toiled
and
still
he
worked
though
fried
and
broiled
i
grieved
for
this
poor
section
man
who
drank
warm
water
from
a
can
and
ate
rye
bread
and
greenish
cheese
and
had
big
blisters
on
his
knees
ods
fish
quoth
i
when
day
is
dead
methinks
you
straightway
go
to
bed
too
to
heave
a
sigh
as
wounded
soldiers
go
to
die
that
where
you
off
the
toiler
said
i
in
no
rush
to
go
to
bed
you
must
be
talking
in
a
trance
tonight
i
going
to
a
dance
gadzooks
thought
i
and
eke
ods
blood
my
tears
have
streamed
a
briny
flood
because
of
all
the
cares
and
woes
the
toiler
knows
and
it
would
seem
from
what
i
learn
that
he
has
fun
and
some
to
burn
gadzooks
again
it
seemeth
plain
that
weeping
in
this
world
is
vain
the
laws
are
numerous
as
flies
upon
a
summer
day
at
making
laws
the
statesmen
wise
still
pound
and
pound
away
no
man
on
earth
could
recollect
a
list
of
all
the
laws
i
tried
it
once
my
mind
is
wrecked
and
now
you
know
the
cause
some
gents
who
are
in
prison
yet
proclaim
with
angry
shout
that
they
are
so
with
laws
beset
they
really
stay
out
a
man
ca
walk
around
a
block
i
heard
a
sad
man
wail
but
what
the
cops
will
round
him
flock
and
chuck
him
into
jail
i
heard
the
butcher
man
repine
and
weep
and
rail
at
fate
because
he
had
to
pay
a
fine
for
being
short
on
weight
i
heard
the
corner
grocer
snort
and
use
some
language
sour
because
they
yanked
him
into
court
for
selling
moldy
flour
the
milkman
bottled
half
the
creek
and
sold
it
on
his
route
he
said
the
law
just
makes
me
sick
when
friends
had
bailed
him
out
the
laws
are
numerous
as
scales
upon
a
fish
no
doubt
and
so
some
people
are
in
jails
and
simply
ca
stay
out
but
all
the
time
and
everywhere
one
great
truth
stands
out
clear
the
man
who
acts
upon
the
square
has
nothing
much
to
fear
of
i
weary
now
of
sherlock
holmes
and
all
the
imitative
crew
i
tired
of
triumphs
built
upon
a
collar
button
as
a
clew
the
sleuth
is
always
tall
and
thin
with
nervous
hands
and
face
he
scours
the
slums
or
moves
around
in
marble
halls
with
equal
grace
he
always
takes
some
kind
of
dope
or
plays
the
flute
or
violin
and
when
he
billed
for
active
work
he
glues
false
whiskers
on
his
chin
he
always
has
a
watson
near
a
tiresome
chump
who
sits
and
broods
the
while
the
sleuth
reels
off
a
string
of
platitudes
detective
yarns
are
all
so
stale
the
plot
is
evermore
the
same
we
always
have
the
murdered
man
with
knives
or
bullets
in
his
frame
the
pantry
window
is
unlocked
the
safe
been
opened
with
a
file
suspicion
shifts
until
it
rests
on
every
man
within
a
mile
the
local
peelers
blunder
round
and
ball
things
up
in
frightful
shape
and
then
the
great
detective
comes
with
lens
and
rule
and
tape
he
crawls
around
upon
the
floor
examines
all
the
water
mains
and
tastes
the
ashes
in
the
stove
and
sticks
his
nose
into
the
drains
and
then
he
says
the
problem
solved
forthwith
he
spends
two
weeks
or
more
in
showing
watson
and
the
world
how
easy
is
to
be
a
bore
it
on
when
you
have
written
a
letter
red
hot
roasting
some
chap
in
his
tenderest
spot
some
one
who
done
you
an
underhand
trick
some
one
who
wounded
your
pride
to
the
quick
try
to
remember
that
writing
abuse
does
no
more
good
than
the
hiss
of
a
goose
this
is
the
meaning
of
all
of
your
sass
you
are
a
villain
and
i
am
an
ass
take
up
your
letter
and
read
it
through
thrice
put
it
on
ice
awhile
put
it
on
ice
maybe
your
wife
is
much
of
a
cook
maybe
she
rather
sit
down
with
a
book
than
to
go
fussing
around
making
pies
doughnuts
and
cakes
and
things
good
to
your
eyes
you
are
preparing
a
withering
speech
you
are
preparing
to
rear
up
and
preach
telling
your
wife
of
the
beautiful
things
cooked
by
your
granny
before
she
had
wings
telling
your
wife
that
her
duty
to
stuff
things
in
your
tummy
till
it
has
enough
when
you
went
courting
that
hausfrau
of
yours
swearing
you
love
her
while
nature
endures
did
you
get
down
on
your
and
rave
dearest
i
needing
a
drudge
and
a
slave
come
to
my
cottage
and
sweep
cook
and
scrub
clean
up
the
dishes
and
sweat
at
the
tub
can
the
reproaches
you
planning
to
make
go
to
a
baker
when
spoiling
for
cake
cut
out
the
sermon
you
think
is
so
nice
put
it
on
ice
awhile
put
it
on
ice
ten
million
bones
said
good
john
dee
will
reach
the
sunny
south
from
me
this
hookworm
scourge
that
ruins
men
and
lays
a
country
waste
again
must
be
suppressed
at
any
cost
those
broken
men
must
not
be
lost
to
make
them
feel
like
men
once
more
to
drive
gaunt
famine
from
their
door
to
make
them
like
strong
saxons
live
ten
million
bones
freely
give
the
victims
of
the
hookworm
scourge
the
toilers
at
the
loom
and
forge
the
humble
yeoman
at
his
plow
may
see
some
ray
of
comfort
now
i
shudder
when
i
read
the
tales
of
ruin
in
those
southern
vales
too
tired
to
do
the
simplest
chores
men
lounge
all
day
about
their
doors
and
when
the
sun
low
in
the
west
the
whole
caboodle
go
to
rest
and
thus
these
tillers
of
the
soil
burn
mighty
little
of
my
oil
when
this
outrageous
worm
decamps
they
trim
the
wicks
and
light
the
lamps
and
read
the
books
they
have
in
stock
and
all
sit
up
till
one
the
hookworm
acted
very
mean
in
shutting
off
the
kerosene
and
so
i
send
a
good
big
roll
to
put
the
blamed
thing
in
the
hole
backward
turn
backward
oh
time
in
thy
flight
feed
me
on
gruel
again
just
for
tonight
i
am
so
wearied
of
restaurant
steaks
vitrified
doughnuts
and
vulcanized
cakes
oysters
that
sleep
in
a
watery
bath
butter
as
strong
as
goliath
of
gath
weary
of
paying
for
what
i
eat
chewing
up
rubber
and
calling
it
meat
backward
turn
backward
for
weary
i
am
give
me
a
whack
at
my
grandmother
jam
let
me
drink
milk
that
has
never
been
skimmed
let
me
eat
butter
whose
hair
has
been
trimmed
let
me
but
once
have
an
pie
then
i
be
willing
to
curl
up
and
die
i
have
been
eating
iron
filings
for
years
is
it
a
wonder
i
melting
in
tears
passing
the
year
growing
ashen
and
weary
and
gray
full
soon
he
will
cash
in
and
mosey
away
a
while
yet
he
totter
along
to
his
grave
he
marked
for
the
slaughter
and
nothing
can
save
the
year
that
is
leaving
seems
weighted
with
woe
and
nature
is
grieving
because
he
must
go
the
forests
are
sighing
and
moaning
all
day
the
night
winds
are
crying
upon
their
sad
way
the
gray
clouds
are
taking
a
threatening
shape
the
dead
grass
is
shaking
like
billows
of
crape
dame
nature
is
tender
and
dirges
she
croon
regretting
the
splendor
and
glory
of
june
she
knows
that
tomorrow
the
old
year
will
sleep
she
knows
that
the
sorrow
of
parting
is
deep
in
this
world
o
never
can
friends
with
us
stay
some
loved
one
forever
is
going
away
and
that
is
the
story
of
people
and
years
a
morning
of
glory
an
evening
of
tears
an
hour
of
caressing
a
call
at
the
dawn
a
prayer
and
a
blessing
and
then
they
are
gone
