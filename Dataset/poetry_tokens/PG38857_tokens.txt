best
of
friends
and
poets
thanks
are
due
to
the
editors
of
poetry
chicago
and
the
egoist
london
for
permission
to
reprint
here
matter
that
originally
appeared
in
the
pages
of
their
respective
publications
preface
the
art
of
poetry
as
practised
in
the
countries
is
in
a
greatly
backward
state
among
the
reading
public
there
are
exactly
three
opinions
generally
held
about
it
the
first
and
by
far
the
most
popular
view
is
that
all
poets
are
fools
and
that
poetry
is
absurd
the
second
is
that
poetry
is
an
agreeable
entertainment
and
that
a
poet
is
great
because
he
has
written
quotable
lines
the
last
and
worst
is
that
which
strives
to
press
the
poet
into
the
service
of
some
philosophical
dogma
ism
or
fad
for
these
views
the
poets
themselves
and
no
others
are
largely
responsible
with
their
exaggerated
vanity
they
have
attempted
to
make
of
their
craft
a
masonic
secret
iterating
that
a
poet
composes
by
ear
alone
that
rhythm
is
not
to
be
analyzed
that
rhyme
is
sacrosanct
that
poets
by
some
special
dispensation
of
providence
write
by
inspiration
being
born
with
more
insight
than
other
men
and
so
forth
is
it
any
wonder
that
the
public
is
indifferent
hostile
or
befooled
when
poets
themselves
disdain
to
explain
clearly
what
they
are
trying
to
do
and
refuse
to
admit
the
public
into
the
privacy
of
their
carefully
guarded
workrooms
it
was
theophile
gautier
i
think
who
offered
to
teach
any
one
how
to
write
poetry
in
lessons
now
this
view
has
in
it
some
exaggeration
but
at
the
same
time
much
truth
no
amount
of
lessoning
will
turn
an
idiot
into
a
wise
man
or
enable
a
man
to
say
something
when
he
is
naturally
one
who
has
nothing
to
say
nevertheless
i
believe
that
there
would
have
been
fewer
mute
inglorious
miltons
greater
respect
paid
to
poetry
and
many
better
poets
if
the
poets
themselves
had
stopped
working
through
sheer
instinct
and
set
themselves
the
task
of
considering
some
elementary
principles
in
their
craft
in
this
belief
and
in
the
hope
of
enlightening
some
one
as
to
the
aim
and
purpose
of
my
work
i
am
writing
this
preface
to
begin
with
the
basis
of
english
poetry
is
rhythm
or
as
some
would
prefer
to
call
it
cadence
this
rhythm
is
obtained
by
mingling
stressed
and
unstressed
syllables
stress
may
be
produced
by
accent
it
may
and
often
is
produced
by
what
is
known
as
quantity
the
breath
required
to
pronounce
certain
syllables
being
more
than
is
required
on
certain
others
however
it
be
produced
it
is
precisely
this
insistence
upon
cadence
upon
the
rhythm
of
the
line
when
spoken
which
sets
poetry
apart
from
prose
and
not
be
it
said
at
the
outset
a
certain
way
of
printing
with
a
capital
letter
at
the
beginning
of
each
line
or
an
insistence
upon
now
this
rhythm
can
be
made
the
same
in
every
line
of
the
poem
this
was
the
aim
of
alexander
pope
for
instance
my
objection
to
this
method
is
that
it
is
both
artificial
and
unmusical
in
the
case
of
the
eighteenth
century
men
it
gave
the
effect
of
a
perfectly
balanced
pattern
like
a
minuet
or
fugue
in
the
case
of
the
modern
imitator
of
kipling
or
masefield
it
gives
the
effect
of
monotonous
in
neither
case
does
it
offer
full
scope
for
emotional
development
i
maintain
that
poetry
is
capable
of
as
many
gradations
in
cadence
as
music
is
in
time
we
can
have
a
rapid
group
of
syllables
what
is
called
a
line
succeeded
by
a
slow
heavy
one
like
the
swift
of
the
wave
and
the
sullen
dragging
of
itself
away
or
we
can
gradually
increase
or
decrease
our
creating
and
effects
or
we
can
follow
a
group
of
rapid
lines
with
a
group
of
slow
ones
or
a
single
slow
or
finally
we
can
have
a
perfectly
even
and
unaltered
movement
throughout
if
we
desire
to
be
monotonous
the
good
poem
is
that
in
which
all
these
effects
are
properly
used
to
convey
the
underlying
emotions
of
its
author
and
that
which
welds
all
these
emotions
into
a
work
of
art
by
the
use
of
dominant
subordinate
themes
proportionate
treatment
repetition
variation
what
in
music
is
called
development
reversal
of
roles
and
return
in
short
the
good
poem
fixes
a
free
emotion
or
a
free
range
of
emotions
into
an
inevitable
and
artistic
whole
the
real
secret
of
the
greatest
english
poets
lies
not
in
their
views
on
life
which
were
naturally
only
those
which
every
sane
man
is
obliged
to
hold
but
in
their
profound
knowledge
of
their
craft
whereby
they
were
enabled
to
put
forth
their
views
in
perfect
form
each
era
of
man
has
its
unique
and
range
of
expression
and
experience
and
therefore
every
poet
must
seek
anew
for
himself
out
of
the
at
his
disposal
rhythms
which
are
adequate
and
forms
which
are
expressive
of
his
own
unique
personality
as
regards
the
length
of
the
lines
themselves
that
depends
altogether
upon
the
apparatus
which
nature
has
given
us
to
enable
us
to
breathe
and
to
speak
each
line
of
a
poem
however
many
or
few
its
stresses
represents
a
single
breath
and
therefore
a
single
perception
the
relation
between
breath
and
perception
is
a
commonplace
of
oriental
philosophy
as
we
breathe
so
do
we
know
the
universe
whether
by
sudden
powerful
gusts
of
inspiration
or
through
the
calmer
but
rarer
gradual
ascent
into
the
hidden
mysteries
of
knowledge
and
slow
falling
away
therefrom
into
darkness
so
much
for
the
question
of
metre
the
second
range
of
problems
with
which
we
are
immediately
concerned
when
we
examine
the
poetic
craft
is
that
which
is
generally
expressed
under
the
name
of
rhyme
now
rhyme
is
undoubtedly
an
element
of
poetry
but
it
is
neither
an
indissoluble
element
nor
is
it
in
every
case
an
inevitable
one
in
the
main
the
instinct
which
makes
for
rhyme
is
sound
poetry
is
an
art
which
demands
though
not
invariably
the
utmost
richness
and
fulness
of
musical
effect
when
rhyme
is
considered
as
an
additional
instrument
of
what
may
be
called
the
poetic
orchestra
it
both
loses
and
gains
in
importance
it
loses
because
it
becomes
of
no
greater
import
than
assonance
consonance
alliteration
and
a
host
of
similar
devices
it
gains
because
it
is
used
intelligently
as
a
device
for
adding
richness
of
effect
instead
of
blindly
as
a
mere
tag
at
the
end
of
a
line
the
system
which
demands
that
the
end
of
every
line
of
poetry
must
rhyme
with
the
end
of
some
one
preceding
or
following
it
has
not
even
the
merit
of
high
antiquity
or
of
civilized
adherence
in
its
essence
it
is
barbarous
it
derives
from
the
stamping
of
feet
clapping
of
hands
pounding
of
drums
or
like
devices
of
savage
peoples
to
mark
the
rhythms
in
their
dances
and
songs
and
its
introduction
into
european
poetry
as
a
rule
to
be
invariably
followed
dates
precisely
from
the
time
of
the
of
the
latin
civilization
and
the
approach
of
what
the
historians
know
as
the
dark
ages
since
it
has
come
into
common
use
among
european
peoples
every
poet
of
eminence
has
tried
to
avoid
its
fatiguing
monotony
by
constructing
new
dante
petrarch
chaucer
spenser
all
these
were
innovators
or
developers
of
what
may
be
known
as
formal
metre
but
let
us
not
forget
that
the
greatest
of
all
shakespeare
used
rhyme
in
his
plays
only
as
additional
decoration
to
a
lyric
or
in
a
perfectly
legitimate
fashion
as
marking
the
necessary
pause
at
the
close
of
a
scene
let
us
also
remember
that
as
he
advanced
in
thought
and
expression
he
gradually
abandoned
rhyme
for
the
only
reason
that
an
artist
abandons
anything
because
it
was
no
longer
adequate
the
process
that
began
with
the
pervigilium
veneris
the
mediæval
and
the
provençal
troubadours
and
which
culminated
in
the
orchestral
blank
verse
of
shakespeare
has
now
passed
through
all
the
stages
of
reduction
to
formula
eclecticism
archaistic
reaction
vulgarization
gramaphone
popularity
and
death
milton
gibbon
among
poets
reduced
it
to
his
dryden
pope
and
his
followers
endlessly
repeated
a
formula
blake
wordsworth
coleridge
attempted
a
return
to
the
elizabethan
and
to
the
even
earlier
ballad
forms
in
the
later
nineteenth
century
we
come
back
to
still
earlier
forms
ballades
rondeaus
even
sestinas
appear
gradually
we
find
the
public
attention
dropping
away
from
these
juggling
feats
performed
with
stale
form
and
turning
to
what
may
be
called
the
new
balladist
the
street
singer
who
is
content
to
doggerelize
and
make
strident
a
once
noble
form
we
have
our
masefields
our
kiplings
and
worse
has
at
last
made
its
appearance
in
poetry
let
us
be
grateful
to
the
man
who
invented
it
nicholas
vachel
lindsay
but
let
us
admit
that
the
force
of
nature
can
no
further
go
it
is
time
to
create
something
new
it
is
time
to
strip
poetry
of
meaningless
tatters
of
form
and
to
clothe
her
in
new
suitable
garments
portents
and
precursors
there
have
been
in
plenty
we
already
have
blake
matthew
arnold
whitman
samuel
butler
and
i
know
not
how
many
more
every
one
is
talking
many
poets
poeticules
and
poetasters
are
writing
what
they
call
free
verse
let
there
be
no
mistake
about
one
thing
free
verse
that
is
flabby
shapelessly
obvious
is
as
much
of
a
crime
against
poetry
as
the
cheapest
echo
of
a
masefield
that
any
doggerel
scribbler
ever
strummed
let
poets
drop
their
formulas
free
or
otherwise
and
determine
to
discipline
themselves
through
experiment
there
is
much
to
be
learned
from
the
precursors
i
have
mentioned
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
learned
from
the
french
poets
parnassians
symbolists
whitmanites
fantaisistes
who
have
in
the
years
to
created
a
new
renaissance
under
our
noses
but
above
all
what
will
teach
us
the
most
is
our
language
and
life
never
was
life
lived
more
richly
more
fully
with
more
terrible
blind
intensity
than
it
is
being
lived
at
this
instant
never
was
the
noble
language
which
is
ours
surpassed
either
in
richness
or
in
concision
we
have
the
material
with
which
to
work
and
the
tools
to
do
the
work
with
it
is

lay

comes

down

is
in

slowly
down

in
death

the
late
moon
fearfully
peering
over
an
immense
shoulder
sees
in
the
shadow
below
the
unpeopled
hush
of
a
street

the
trees
like
great
jade
elephants
chained

and

gadflies

elephants

crimson

golden

the
clouds

carven
marvels

my
heart
crimson
placques

diamond

green

off

soul

rain

crimson
petals

love

afternoon

brush

the
pine
pan
of
the
woods
whispered
in
my
ear
his
song
like
liquid
fire
it
ran
through
my
veins
thus
he
piped
sad
lonely
son
of
the
woods
lie
down
in
the
long
still
grass
and
sleep
ere
the
dawn
has
hidden
her
swelling
breasts
ere
the
morning
has
covered
her
massive
flanks
with
the
mantle
of
noon
lie
down
in
the
dewless
grass
nor
awake
to
see
whether
afternoon
has
hurried
in
from
the
rim
of
her
purple
robe
dropping
dim
flowers
golden
flowers
with
cups
flowers
of
silence
heed
not
though
eve
should
sail
a
grey
swan
in
the
pool
of
the
sky
spreading
low
ripples
heed
these
not
only
awake
when
slim
twilight
plunges
her
body
in
the
last
blown
spray
of
the
sun
awake
then
for
twilight
and
dawn
are
your
day
therefore
lie
down
in
the
long
dim
grass
and
sleep
and
i
will
blow
my
low
pipes
over
you
xiii
as
i
went
through
the
city
by
day
i
saw
shadows
in
sunlight
but
in
the
night
i
saw
everywhere
stars
within
the
darkness
a
coldly
fluting
breeze
dark
pan
under
the
trees
low
laughter
up
the
sky
a
star
like
a
left
on
high
as
i
went
through
the
city
by
day
i
was
hustled
by
jostling
people
but
in
the
night
the
wind
of
the
darkness
whispered
hush
to
my
soul
xiv
brown
bed
of
earth
still
fresh
and
warm
with
love
now
hold
me
tight
broad
field
of
sky
where
the
clouds
laughing
move
fill
up
my
pores
with
light
you
trees
now
talk
to
me
chatter
and
scold
or
weep
or
drowsing
stand
you
winds
now
play
with
me
you
wild
things
creep
you
boulders
bruise
my
hand
i
now
am
yours
and
you
are
mine
it
matters
not
what
gods
herein
i
see
you
grow
in
me
i
am
rooted
to
this
spot
we
drink
and
pass
the
cup
immortally
xv
o
seeded
grass
you
army
of
little
men
crawling
up
the
long
slope
with
quivering
quick
blades
of
steel
you
who
storm
millions
of
graves
tiny
green
tentacles
of
earth
interlace
yourselves
tightly
over
my
heart
and
do
not
let
me
go
for
i
would
lie
here
forever
and
watch
with
one
eye
the
pilgrimaging
ants
in
your
dull
savage
jungles
the
while
with
the
other
i
see
the
stiff
lines
of
the
slope
break
in
a
wave
surprisingly
arrested
and
above
them
wavering
dancing
bodiless
colourless
unreal
the
long
thin
lazy
fingers
of
the
heat
xvi
an
ant
crawling
up
a
and
above
it
the
sky
i
shall
remember
these
when
i
die
an
ant
and
a
butterfly
and
the
sky
the
grass
is
full
of
and
poppies
through
the
air
darts
many
a
fly
the
ant
toils
up
its
the
careless
hours
go
by
the
bow
to
the
feet
of
the
lazy
hours
they
walk
out
of
the
wood
showering
shadows
on
flowers
their
robes
flutter
vaguely
far
off
there
in
the
clearing
i
see
them
sometimes
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
xvii
the
wind
that
drives
the
fine
dry
sand
across
the
strand
the
sad
wind
spinning
arabesques
with
a
wrinkled
hand
labyrinths
of
shifting
sand
the
dancing
dunes
i
will
arise
and
run
with
the
sand
and
gather
it
greedily
in
my
hand
i
will
wriggle
like
a
long
yellow
snake
over
the
beaches
i
will
lie
curled
up
sleeping
and
the
wind
shall
chase
me
far
inland
my
breath
is
the
music
of
the
mad
wind
shrill
piping
stamping
of
drunken
feet
the
fluttering
tattered
broidery
flung
over
the
dunes
steep
escarpments
the
fine
dry
sand
that
whistles
down
the
long
low
beaches

brown
blue

swell
to
your
immensity

will
run
over
the
endless
beach
i
will
shout
to
the
breaking
spray
i
will
touch
the
sky
with
my
fingers
my
happiness
is
like
this
sand
i
let
it
run
out
of
my
hand
xix
the
clouds
pass
over
the
polished
mirror
of
the
sky
the
clouds
pass
puffs
of
grey
there
is
no
star
the
clouds
pass
slowly
suddenly
a
disengaged
star
flashes
the
night
is
cold
and
the
clouds
roll
slowly
over
the
sky
xx
i
dance
i
exist
in
motion
a
flower
spilling
my
drops
in
the
sunlight
i
feel
the
muscles
bending
relaxing
beneath
me
i
direct
the
rippling
sweep
of
the
lines
of
my
body
its
impact
crashes
through
the
thin
walls
of
the
atmosphere
i
dance
about
me
whirls
the
sombre
hall
the
gaudy
stage
the
harsh
glare
of
the
footlights
and
in
the
brains
of
thousands
watching
little
flames
leap
quivering
to
the
music
of
my
effort
i
have
danced
i
have
expressed
my
soul
in
unbroken
rhythm
sorrow
and
flame
i
am
tired
i
would
be
extinguished
beneath
your
beating
hands
xxi
not
noisily
but
solemnly
and
pale
in
a
meditative
ecstasy
you
entered
life
as
performing
some
strange
rite
to
which
you
alone
held
the
clue
child
life
did
not
give
rude
strength
to
you
from
the
beginning
you
would
seem
to
have
thrown
away
as
something
cold
and
cumbersome
that
armour
men
use
against
death
you
would
perhaps
look
on
him
face
to
face
and
so
learn
the
secret
whether
that
face
wears
oftenest
a
smile
or
no
strange
old
and
silent
being
there
is
something
infinitely
vast
in
your
intense
tininess
i
think
you
could
point
out
with
a
smile
some
curious
star
far
off
in
the
heavens
which
no
man
has
seen
before
xxii
the
morning
is
clean
and
blue
and
the
wind
blows
up
the
clouds
now
my
thoughts
gathered
from
afar
once
again
in
their
patched
armour
with
rusty
plumes
and
blunted
swords
move
out
to
war
smoking
our
morning
pipes
we
shall
ride
two
and
two
through
the
woods
for
our
old
cause
keeps
us
together
and
our
hatred
is
so
precious
not
death
or
defeat
can
break
it
god
willing
we
shall
this
day
meet
that
old
enemy
who
has
given
us
so
many
a
good
beating
thank
god
we
have
a
cause
worth
fighting
for
and
a
cause
worth
losing
and
a
good
song
to
sing
xxiii
torridly
the
moon
rolls
upward
against
the
smooth
immensity
of
midsummer
sky
changeless
inexhaustible
the
city
beneath
is
still
heaven
and
earth
are
clasped
together
momently
life
grows
as
careless
as
the
life
of
the
intense
stars
out
of
the
houses
climbing
fuming
up
windows
flickering
from
every
rigid
on
sonorous
pinnacles
silently
swirl
aloft
love
infinite
flamelets
xxiv
o
all
you
stars
up
yonder
do
you
hear
me
beautiful
winking
sullen
eyes
i
am
tired
of
seeing
you
in
the
same
old
places
night
after
night
in
the
sky
i
hoped
you
would
dance
but
after
years
i
find
you
are
determined
to
stay
as
you
are
so
i
make
it
known
to
you
stars
clustered
or
solitary
that
i
want
you
to
fall
into
my
lap
come
down
little
stars
let
me
play
with
you
i
will
string
you
like
beads
and
shovel
you
together
and
wear
you
in
my
ears
and
scatter
you
over
people
and
toss
you
back
like
apples
if
i
choose
xxv
as
i
wandered
over
the
city
through
the
night
i
saw
many
strange
things
but
i
have
forgotten
all
except
one
painted
face
gaudy
shameless
heavy
flushed
sticky
with
narcotic
perfume
there
was
something
in
you
which
made
me
prefer
you
above
all
the
feeble
of
the
world
you
were
neither
burnt
out
nor
pallid
there
was
plain
coarse
vulgar
meaning
in
every
line
of
you
and
no
you
were
at
least
alive
when
all
the
rest
were
but
puppets
of
the
night
xxvi
slowly
along
the
street
amid
the
last
sad
drifting
crowds
of
midnight
like
lost
souls
wandering
comes
marching
by
solemnly
as
for
some
ritual
of
old
a
monotonous
procession
of
black
carts
full
crowded
with
blossom
scarlet
geraniums
unfolding
their
fiery
globes
upon
the
night
these
are
the
memories
of
day
moulded
in
jagged
flame
lust
joy
blood
and
death
with
crushed
hands
weary
eyes
and
hoarse
clamour
we
consecrate
and
acclaim
them
tumultuously
ere
they
pass
contemptuous
beyond
the
unpierced
veil
of
silence
xxvii
i
think
there
was
an
hour
in
which
god
laughed
at
me
for
as
i
passed
along
the
street
saw
that
all
the
women
although
their
bodies
were
dexterously
concealed
were
thinking
with
all
their
might
what
men
were
like
and
the
men
mechanically
correct
cigars
at
lips
were
wanting
to
rush
at
the
women
but
were
restrained
by
respectability
or
timidity
or
fear
of
the
consequences
or
vanity
or
some
puerile
dream
of
a
pale
ideal
lost
in
the
vast
grey
sky
so
i
said
to
myself
it
is
time
to
end
all
this
i
will
take
the
first
woman
that
comes
along
and
then
god
laughed
at
me
and
i
too
smiled
to
see
that
he
was
in
such
good
humour
and
that
the
sun
was
shining
xxviii
i
remember
there
was
a
day
during
which
i
did
not
write
a
line
of
verse
nor
did
i
speak
a
word
to
any
woman
nor
did
i
meet
with
death
yet
all
that
day
i
was
fully
occupied
my
eyes
saw
trees
clouds
streets
houses
people
my
lungs
breathed
air
my
mouth
swallowed
food
and
drink
my
hands
seized
things
my
feet
touched
earth
or
spurned
it
at
my
desire
on
that
day
i
know
i
would
have
been
sufficiently
happy
if
i
could
have
kept
my
brain
from
bothering
at
all
about
my
next
trite
poem
about
the
tedious
necessities
of
sex
and
about
the
day
on
which
i
would
at
last
meet
death
xxix
it
is
evening
and
the
earth
wraps
her
shoulders
in
an
old
blue
shawl
afar
off
there
clink
the
polychrome
points
of
the
stars
indefatigable
after
all
these
years
here
upon
earth
there
is
life
and
then
death
dawn
and
later
nightfall
fire
and
the
quenching
of
embers
but
why
should
i
not
remember
that
my
night
is
dawn
in
another
part
of
the
world
if
the
idea
fits
my
fancy
dawns
of
marvellous
light
wakeful
sleepy
weary
dancing
dawns
you
are
rose
petals
settling
through
the
blue
of
my
evening
i
light
my
pipe
to
salute
you
and
sit
puffing
smoke
in
the
air
and
never
say
a
word
xxx
i
have
seemed
often
feeble
and
useless
to
myself
and
many
times
i
have
wished
that
the
tedium
of
my
life
lay
at
last
dissolved
in
the
cold
acid
of
death
yet
i
have
not
forgotten
the
sparkling
of
waters
in
the
sunlight
the
sound
of
a
woman
voice
gliding
dancers
chanting
worshippers
a
child
crying
the
wind
amid
the
hills
these
i
can
remember
and
i
think
they
are
more
of
me
than
the
wrinkles
on
my
face
and
the
hungry
ache
at
my
heart
xxxi
my
arms
break
into
sudden
gesture
my
feet
seize
upon
the
rhythm
my
hands
drag
it
upwards
thus
i
create
the
dance
i
drink
of
the
red
bowl
of
the
sunlight
i
swim
through
seas
of
rain
i
dig
my
toes
into
earth
i
taste
the
smack
of
the
wind
i
am
myself
i
live
the
temples
of
the
gods
are
forgotten
or
in
ruins
professors
are
still
arguing
about
the
past
and
the
future
i
am
sick
of
reading
marginal
notes
on
life
i
am
weary
of
following
false
banners
i
desire
nothing
more
intensely
or
completely
than
this
present
there
is
nothing
about
me
you
are
more
likely
to
notice
than
my
being
let
me
therefore
rejoice
silently
a
golden
butterfly
glancing
against
an
unflecked
wall
xxxii
today
you
shall
have
but
little
song
from
me
for
i
belong
to
the
sunlight
this
i
would
not
barter
for
any
kingdom
i
am
a
wheeling
swallow
blue
all
over
is
my
delight
i
am
a
drowsy
in
the
greenest
shadow
xxxiii
my
desire
goes
bristling
and
growling
like
an
angry
leopard
my
ribs
are
a
hollow
grating
my
hair
is
coarse
and
hard
my
flanks
are
like
sharp
iron
wedges
my
eyes
glitter
as
chill
glass
down
below
there
are
the
meadows
where
my
famished
hopes
are
feeding
i
will
waylay
them
to
windward
stalking
in
watchful
patience
i
will
pounce
upon
them
plunging
my
muzzle
in
the
hot
spurt
of
their
blood
xxxiv
the
flag
let
loose
for
a
day
of
festivity
free
desperate
symbol
of
battle
and
desire
leaping
lunging
tossing
up
the
halyards
below

a
tumult
of
music
above
it
the
streaming
wastes
of
the
sky
pinnacles
of
clouds

infinite

everlasting

the
immense

aloft
in
glory
over

hilltops
transmitting
its
lightnings
xxxv
what

you

you
what

you

looms
of

like
cataracts
that
crash
from
a
crumbling
crag
into
the
smouldering
gulf
of
a
lake
below
landlocked
amid
the
mountains
so
my
soul
was
a
gorge
that
was
filled
with
the
warring
echoes
of
song
of
old
they
wore
shining
armour
and
banners
of
broad
gold
they
bore
now
they
drift
like
a
wild
bird
cry
downwards
from
chill
summits
of
the
sky
fountains
of
flashing
joy
were
their
source
afar
now
they
lie
still
to
mirror
every
star
in
circles
of
opal
ruby

they
drift
down
to
a
dull
dark
monotone
pluck
the
loose

as

and
star
but
yet
so
still
i

not
whence
they
come

in

a
vast

through
infinite
years
bursting
the
white
thronged
vaults
of
the
cool
sky
till
hurtling
down
there
falls
one
mad
black

the
chained

the
barking
of
little

those
who
watch
for

see

they
are
mad
ever
after

with

over
