do
you
remember
one
immortal
lost
moment
out
of
time
and
space
what
time
we
thought
who
passed
the
portal
of
that
divine
disastrous
place
where
life
was
slain
and
truth
was
slandered
on
that
one
holier
hill
than
rome
how
far
abroad
our
bodies
wandered
that
evening
when
our
souls
came
home
the
mystic
city
with
monstrous
columns
was
your
own
herodian
stones
fell
down
and
waited
two
thousand
years
to
be
your
throne
in
the
grey
rocks
the
burning
blossom
glowed
terrible
as
the
sacred
blood
it
was
no
stranger
to
your
bosom
than
bluebells
of
an
english
wood
do
you
remember
a
road
that
follows
the
way
of
unforgotten
feet
where
from
the
waste
of
rocks
and
hollows
climb
up
the
crawling
crooked
street
the
stages
of
one
towering
drama
always
ahead
and
out
of
sight
do
you
remember
aceldama
and
the
jackal
barking
in
the
night
life
is
not
void
or
stuff
for
scorners
we
have
laughed
loud
and
kept
our
love
we
have
heard
singers
in
tavern
corners
and
not
forgotten
the
birds
above
we
have
known
smiters
and
sons
of
thunder
and
not
unworthily
walked
with
them
we
have
grown
wiser
and
lost
not
wonder
and
we
have
seen

the

barbara
is
the
patron
saint
of
artillery
and
of
those
in
danger
of
sudden
death
when
the
long
grey
lines
came
flooding
upon
paris
in
the
plain
we
stood
and
drank
of
the
last
free
air
we
never
could
taste
again
they
had
led
us
back
from
the
lost
battle
to
halt
we
knew
not
where
and
stilled
us
and
our
gaping
guns
were
dumb
with
our
despair
the
grey
tribes
flowed
for
ever
from
the
infinite
lifeless
lands
and
a
norman
to
a
breton
spoke
his
chin
upon
his
hands
was
an
end
to
ilium
and
an
end
came
to
rome
and
a
man
plays
on
a
painted
stage
in
the
land
that
he
calls
home
arch
after
arch
of
triumph
but
floor
beyond
falling
floor
that
lead
to
a
low
door
at
last
and
beyond
there
is
no
and
the
breton
to
the
norman
spoke
like
a
small
child
spoke
he
and
his
eyes
were
empty
as
his
home
beside
the
sea
are
more
windows
in
one
house
than
there
are
eyes
to
see
there
are
more
doors
in
a
house
but
god
has
hid
the
key
ruin
is
a
builder
of
windows
her
legend
witnesseth
barbara
the
saint
of
gunners
and
a
stay
in
sudden
it
seemed
the
wheel
of
the
world
stood
still
an
instant
in
its
turning
more
than
the
kings
of
the
earth
that
turned
with
the
turning
of
valmy
mill
while
trickled
the
idle
tale
and
the
eyes
were
burning
still
as
the
heart
of
a
whirlwind
the
heart
of
the
world
stood
still
the
beautiful
had
praise
of
lute
and
pen
her
hair
was
like
a
summer
night
dark
and
desired
of
men
her
feet
like
birds
from
far
away
that
linger
and
light
in
doubt
and
her
face
was
like
a
window
where
a
first
love
looked
out
her
sire
was
master
of
many
slaves
a
hard
man
of
his
hands
they
built
a
tower
about
her
in
the
desolate
golden
lands
sealed
as
the
tyrants
sealed
their
tombs
planned
with
an
ancient
plan
and
set
two
windows
in
the
tower
like
the
two
eyes
of
a
our
guns
were
set
toward
the
foe
we
had
no
word
for
firing
grey
in
the
gateway
of
gond
the
guard
of
the
tyrant
shone
dark
with
the
fate
of
a
falling
star
retiring
and
retiring
the
breton
line
went
backward
and
the
breton
tale
went
on
father
had
sailed
across
the
sea
from
the
harbour
of
africa
when
all
the
slaves
took
up
their
tools
for
the
bidding
of
barbara
she
smote
the
bare
wall
with
her
hand
and
bad
them
smite
again
she
poured
them
wealth
of
wine
and
meat
to
stay
them
in
their
pain
and
cried
through
the
lifted
thunder
of
thronging
hammer
and
hod
open
the
third
window
in
the
third
name
of
then
the
hearts
failed
and
the
tools
fell
and
far
towards
the
foam
men
saw
a
shadow
on
the
sands
and
her
father
coming
speak
low
and
low
along
the
line
the
whispered
word
is
flying
before
the
touch
before
the
time
we
may
not
loose
a
breath
their
guns
must
mash
us
to
the
mire
and
there
be
no
replying
till
the
hand
is
raised
to
fling
us
for
the
final
dice
to
death
were
two
windows
in
your
tower
barbara
barbara
for
all
between
the
sun
and
moon
in
the
lands
of
africa
hath
a
man
three
eyes
barbara
a
bird
three
wings
that
you
have
riven
roof
and
wall
to
look
upon
vain
things
her
voice
was
like
a
wandering
thing
that
falters
yet
is
free
whose
soul
has
drunk
in
a
distant
land
of
the
rivers
of
liberty
are
more
wings
than
the
wind
knows
or
eyes
than
see
the
sun
in
the
light
of
the
lost
window
and
the
wind
of
the
doors
undone
for
out
of
the
first
lattice
are
the
red
lands
that
break
and
out
of
the
second
lattice
sea
like
a
green
snake
but
out
of
the
third
lattice
under
low
eaves
like
wings
is
a
new
corner
of
the
sky
and
the
other
side
of
it
opened
in
the
inmost
place
an
instant
beyond
uttering
a
casement
and
a
chasm
and
a
thunder
of
doors
undone
a
strong
wing
shaken
out
the
shock
of
its
unshuttering
that
split
the
shattered
sunlight
from
a
light
behind
the
sun
he
drew
sword
and
drave
her
where
the
judges
sat
and
said
sits
above
the
gods
barbara
the
maid
caesar
hath
made
a
treaty
with
the
moon
and
with
the
sun
all
the
gods
that
men
can
praise
praise
him
every
one
there
is
peace
with
the
anointed
of
the
scarlet
oils
of
bel
with
the
fish
god
where
the
whirlpool
is
a
winding
stair
to
hell
with
the
pathless
pyramids
of
slime
where
the
mitred
negro
lifts
to
his
black
cherub
in
the
cloud
abominable
gifts
with
the
leprous
silver
cities
where
the
dumb
priests
dance
and
nod
but
not
with
the
three
windows
and
the
last
name
of
they
are
firing
we
are
falling
and
the
red
skies
rend
and
shiver
us
barbara
barbara
we
may
not
loose
a
be
at
the
bursting
doors
of
doom
and
in
the
dark
deliver
us
who
loosen
the
last
window
on
the
sun
of
sudden
death
the
beautiful
stood
up
as
queen
set
free
whose
mouth
is
set
to
a
terrible
cup
and
the
trumpet
of
liberty
have
looked
forth
from
a
window
that
no
man
now
shall
bar
toppling
shall
never
stretch
so
far
the
slaves
are
dancing
in
their
chains
the
child
laughs
at
the
rod
because
of
the
bird
of
the
three
wings
and
the
third
face
of
the
sword
upon
his
shoulder
shifted
and
shone
and
fell
and
barbara
lay
very
small
and
crumpled
like
a
what
wall
upon
what
hinges
turned
stands
open
like
a
door
too
simple
for
the
sight
of
faith
too
huge
for
human
eyes
what
light
upon
what
ancient
way
shines
to
a
floor
the
line
of
the
lost
land
of
france
or
the
plains
of
paradise
smiled
above
the
gods
his
lip
of
stone
was
curled
his
iron
armies
wound
like
chains
round
and
round
the
world
and
the
strong
slayer
of
his
own
that
cut
down
flesh
for
grass
smiled
too
and
went
to
his
own
tower
like
a
walking
tower
of
brass
and
the
songs
ceased
and
the
slaves
were
dumb
and
far
towards
the
foam
men
saw
a
shadow
on
the
sands
and
her
father
coming
home
blood
of
his
blood
upon
the
sword
stood
red
but
never
dry
he
wiped
it
slowly
till
the
blade
was
blue
as
the
blue
sky
but
the
blue
sky
split
with
a
spat
down
a
blinding
brand
and
all
of
him
lay
back
and
flat
as
his
shadow
on
the
the
touch
and
the
tornado
all
our
guns
give
tongue
together
barbara
for
the
gunnery
and
god
defend
the
right
they
are
stopped
and
gapped
and
battered
as
we
blast
away
the
weather
building
window
upon
window
to
our
lady
of
the
light
for
the
light
is
come
on
liberty
her
foes
are
falling
falling
they
are
reeling
they
are
running
as
the
shameful
years
have
run
she
is
risen
for
all
the
humble
she
has
heard
the
conquered
calling
barbara
of
the
gunners
with
her
hand
upon
the
gun
they
are
burst
asunder
in
the
midst
that
eat
of
their
own
flatteries
whose
lip
is
curled
to
order
as
its
barbered
hair
is
curled
blast
of
the
beauty
of
sudden
death
barbara
of
the
batteries
that
blow
the
new
white
window
in
the
wall
of
all
the
world
for
the
hand
is
raised
behind
us
and
the
bolt
smites
hard
through
the
rending
of
the
doorways
through
the
of
the
guard
for
the
cry
of
the
three
colours
is
in
condé
and
beyond
and
the
guard
is
flung
for
carrion
in
the
graveyard
of
gond
through
mondemont
and
out
of
it
through
morin
marsh
and
on
with
earthquake
of
salutation
the
impossible
thing
is
gone
gaul
charioted
and
charging
great
gaul
upon
a
gun
on
all
her
thousand
years
and
trumpeting
to
the
sun
as
day
returns
as
death
returns
swung
backwards
and
swung
home
back
on
the
barbarous
reign
returns
the
of
rome
while
that
that
the
east
held
hard
and
hot
like
pincers
in
a
forge
came
like
the
west
wind
roaring
up
the
cannon
of
george
where
the
hunt
is
up
and
racing
over
stream
and
swamp
and
tarn
and
their
batteries
black
with
battle
hold
the
bridgeheads
of
the
marne
and
across
the
carnage
of
the
guard
by
paris
in
the
plain
the
normans
to
the
bretons
cried
and
the
bretons
cheered
again
but
he
that
told
the
tale
went
home
to
his
house
beside
the
sea
and
burned
before
barbara
the
light
of
the
windows
three
three
candles
for
an
unknown
thing
never
to
come
again
that
opened
like
the
eye
of
god
on
paris
in
the
plain
elegy
in
a
country
churchyard
the
men
that
worked
for
england
they
have
their
graves
at
home
and
bees
and
birds
of
england
about
the
cross
can
roam
but
they
that
fought
for
england
following
a
falling
star
alas
alas
for
england
they
have
their
graves
afar
and
they
that
rule
in
england
in
stately
conclave
met
alas
alas
for
england
they
have
no
graves
as
yet
the
sword
of
surprise
sunder
me
from
my
bones
o
sword
of
god
till
they
stand
stark
and
strange
as
do
the
trees
that
i
whose
heart
goes
up
with
the
soaring
woods
may
marvel
as
much
at
these
sunder
me
from
my
blood
that
in
the
dark
i
hear
that
red
ancestral
river
run
like
branching
buried
floods
that
find
the
sea
but
never
see
the
sun
give
me
miraculous
eyes
to
see
my
eyes
those
rolling
mirrors
made
alive
in
me
terrible
crystal
more
incredible
than
all
the
things
they
see
sunder
me
from
my
soul
that
i
may
see
the
sins
like
streaming
wounds
the
brave
beat
till
i
shall
save
myself
as
i
would
save
a
stranger
in
the
street
a
wedding
in
our
god
who
made
two
lovers
in
a
garden
and
smote
them
separate
and
set
them
free
their
four
eyes
wild
for
wonder
and
wrath
and
pardon
and
their
kiss
thunder
as
lips
of
land
and
sea
each
rapt
unendingly
beyond
the
other
two
starry
worlds
of
unknown
gods
at
war
wife
and
not
mate
a
man
and
not
a
brother
we
thank
thee
thou
hast
made
us
what
we
are
make
not
the
grey
slime
of
infinity
to
swamp
these
flowers
thou
madest
one
by
one
let
not
the
night
that
was
thine
enemy
mix
a
mad
twilight
of
the
moon
and
sun
waken
again
to
thunderclap
and
clamour
the
wonder
of
our
sundering
and
the
song
or
break
our
hearts
with
thine
hammer
but
leave
a
shade
between
us
all
day
long
shade
of
high
shame
and
honourable
blindness
when
youth
in
storm
of
dizzy
and
distant
things
finds
the
wild
windfall
of
a
little
kindness
and
shakes
to
think
that
all
the
world
has
wings
when
the
one
head
that
turns
the
heavens
in
turning
moves
yet
as
lightly
as
a
lingering
bird
and
red
and
random
blown
astray
but
burning
like
a
lost
spark
goes
by
the
glorious
word
make
not
this
sex
this
other
side
of
things
a
thing
less
distant
than
the
desire
what
colour
to
the
end
of
evening
clings
and
what
far
cry
of
frontiers
and
what
fire
fallen
too
far
beyond
the
sun
for
seeking
let
it
divide
us
though
our
kingdom
come
with
a
far
signal
in
our
secret
speaking
to
hang
the
proud
horizon
in
our
home
once
we
were
one
a
shapeless
cloud
that
lingers
loading
the
seas
and
shutting
out
the
skies
one
with
the
woods
a
monster
of
myriad
fingers
you
laid
on
me
no
finger
of
surprise
one
with
the
stars
a
god
with
myriad
eyes
i
saw
you
nowhere
and
was
blind
for
scorn
one
till
the
world
was
riven
and
the
rise
of
the
white
days
when
you
and
i
were
born
darkens
the
world
the
fetters
rattle
and
these
that
have
no
hope
behind
the
sun
may
feed
like
bondmen
and
may
breed
like
cattle
one
in
the
darkness
as
the
dead
are
one
us
if
the
rended
grave
give
up
its
glory
trumpets
shall
summon
asunder
and
face
to
face
we
will
be
strangers
in
so
strange
a
story
and
wonder
meeting
in
so
wild
a
place
ah
not
in
vain
or
utterly
for
loss
come
even
the
black
flag
and
the
if
these
grey
devils
flee
the
sign
of
the
cross
even
in
the
symbol
of
the
crossing
swords
nor
shall
death
doubt
who
made
our
souls
alive
swords
meeting
and
not
stakes
set
side
by
side
bade
us
in
the
sunburst
and
the
thunder
thrive
earthquake
and
dawn
the
bridegroom
and
the
bride
death
and
not
dreams
or
doubt
of
things
undying
of
whose
the
holy
hearth
or
whose
the
sword
though
sacred
spirits
dissever
in
strong
crying
into
thy
hands
but
thy
two
hands
o
lord
though
not
in
earth
as
once
in
eden
standing
so
plain
again
we
see
thee
what
thou
art
as
in
this
blaze
the
blasting
and
the
branding
of
this
wild
wedding
where
we
meet
and
part
the
mystery
if
sunset
clouds
could
grow
on
trees
it
would
but
match
the
may
in
flower
and
skies
be
underneath
the
seas
no
topsyturvier
than
a
shower
if
mountains
rose
on
wings
to
wander
they
were
no
wilder
than
a
cloud
yet
all
my
praise
is
mean
as
slander
mean
as
these
mean
words
spoken
aloud
and
never
more
than
now
i
know
that
first
heaven
is
far
behind
unless
the
blazing
blow
has
left
him
in
the
garden
blind
witness
o
sun
that
blinds
our
eyes
unthinkable
and
unthankable
king
that
though
all
other
wonder
dies
i
wonder
at
not
wondering
myth
of
o
learned
man
who
never
learned
to
learn
save
to
deduce
by
timid

from
towering
smoke
that
fire
can
never
burn
and
from
tall
tales
that
men
were
never
tall
say
have
you
thought
what
manner
of
man
it
is
of
whom
men
say
could
strike
giants
or
what
strong
memories
over
abyss
bore
up
the
pomp
of
camelot
and
the
crown
and
why
one
banner
all
the
background
fills
beyond
the
pageants
of
so
many
spears
and
by
what
witchery
in
the
western
hills
a
throne
stands
empty
for
a
thousand
years
who
hold
unheeding
this
immense
impact
immortal
story
for
a
mortal
sin
lest
human
fable
touch
historic

chase
myths
like

them
with

take
comfort
needs
not
this
ado
you
shall
not
be
a
myth
i
promise
you
the
old
song
on
the
embankment
in
stormy
weather
a
livid
sky
on
london
and
like
iron
steeds
that
rear
a
shock
of
engines
halted
and
i
knew
the
end
was
near
and
something
said
that
far
away
over
the
hills
and
far
away
there
came
a
crawling
thunder
and
the
end
of
all
things
here
for
london
bridge
is
broken
down
broken
down
broken
down
as
digging
lets
the
daylight
on
the
sunken
streets
of
yore
the
lightning
looked
on
london
town
the
broken
bridge
of
london
town
the
ending
of
a
broken
road
where
men
shall
go
no
more
i
saw
the
kings
of
london
town
the
kings
that
buy
and
sell
that
built
it
up
with
penny
loaves
and
penny
lies
as
well
and
where
the
streets
were
paved
with
gold
the
shrivelled
paper
shone
for
gold
the
scorching
light
of
promises
that
pave
the
streets
of
hell
for
penny
loaves
will
melt
away
melt
away
melt
away
mock
the
mean
that
haggled
in
the
grain
they
did
not
grow
with
hungry
faces
in
the
gate
a
hundred
thousand
in
the
gate
a
on
london
and
the
finding
of
the
foe
i
heard
the
hundred
slow
down
their
racking
din
till
in
the
stillness
men
could
hear
the
dropping
of
the
pin
and
somewhere
men
without
the
wall
beneath
the
wood
without
the
wall
had
found
the
place
where
london
ends
and
england
can
begin
for
pins
and
needles
bend
and
break
bend
and
break
bend
and
break
faster
than
the
breaking
spears
or
the
bending
of
the
bow
of
pageants
pale
in
and
the
hundreds
marching
on
the
hills
in
the
wars
of
long
ago
i
saw
great
cobbett
riding
the
horseman
of
the
shires
and
his
face
was
red
with
judgment
and
a
light
of
luddite
fires
and
south
to
sussex
and
the
sea
the
lights
leapt
up
for
liberty
the
trumpet
of
the
yeomanry
the
hammer
of
the
squires
for
bars
of
iron
rust
away
rust
away
rust
away
rend
before
the
hammer
and
the
horseman
riding
in
crying
that
all
men
at
the
last
and
at
the
worst
and
at
the
last
have
found
the
place
where
england
ends
and
england
can
begin
his
go
before
you
far
beyond
your
bursting
tyres
and
time
is
bridged
behind
him
and
our
sons
are
with
our
sires
a
trailing
meteor
on
the
downs
he
rides
above
the
rotting
towns
the
horseman
of

the

broken
down
broken

the

that
were

a

of

a

grow
dim

dizzy
with

changes
and
degrees
it
is
but
our
mirror
hung
dreaming
in
its
place
shining
with
only
shadows
till
she
wakes
it
with
her
face
the
standing
whirlpool
of
the

the

a

took
the

that
marked

that
love
the

and
told
the
angel
of
the
book
and
pen
me
as
one
that
loves
his
for
them
alone
i
labour
to
reclaim
the
ragged
roaming
bedouin
and
to
tame
to
ordered
service
to
uproot
their
vine
who
mock
the
prophet
being
mad
with
wine
let
daylight
through
their
tents
and
through
their
lives
number
their
camels
even
count
their
wives
plot
out
the
desert
into
streets
and
squares
and
count
it
a
more
fruitful
work
than
theirs
who
lift
a
vain
and
visionary
love
to
your
vague
allah
in
the
skies
gently
replied
the
angel
of
the
pen
in
peace
and
love
your
and
love
not
god
since
men
alone
are
dear
only
fear
god
for
you
have
cause
to
on
the
downs
when
you
came
over
the
top
of
the
world
in
the
great
day
on
the
downs
the
air
was
crisp
and
the
clouds
were
curled
when
you
came
over
the
top
of
the
world
and
under
your
feet
were
spire
and
street
and
seven
english
towns
and
i
could
not
think
that
the
pride
was
perished
as
you
came
over
the
down
liberty
chivalry
all
we
cherished
lost
in
a
rattle
of
pelf
and
perished
or
the
land
we
love
that
you
walked
above
withering
town
by
town
for
you
came
out
on
the
dome
of
the
earth
like
a
vision
of
victory
out
on
the
great
green
dome
of
the
earth
as
the
great
blue
dome
of
the
sky
for
girth
and
under
your
feet
the
shires
could
meet
and
your
eyes
went
out
to
sea
under
your
feet
the
towns
were
seven
alive
and
alone
on
high
your
back
to
the
broad
white
wall
of
heaven
you
were
one
and
the
towns
were
seven
single
and
one
as
the
soaring
sun
and
your
head
upheld
the
sky
and
i
thought
of
a
thundering
flag
unfurled
and
the
roar
of
the
bell
beacons
crackled
and
bolts
were
hurled
as
you
came
over
the
top
of
the
world
and
under
your
feet
were
chance
and
cheat
and
the
slime
of
the
slopes
of
hell
it
has
not
been
as
the
great
wind
spoke
on
the
great
green
down
that
day
we
have
seen
wherever
the
wide
wind
spoke
slavery
slaying
the
english
folk
the
robbers
of
land
we
have
seen
command
the
rulers
of
land
obey
we
have
seen
the
gigantic
golden
worms
in
the
garden
of
paradise
we
have
seen
the
great
and
the
wise
make
terms
with
the
peace
of
snakes
and
the
pride
of
worms
and
them
that
plant
make
covenant
with
the
locust
and
the
lice
and
the
wind
blows
and
the
world
goes
on
and
the
world
can
say
that
we
who
stood
on
the
cliffs
where
the
quarries
shone
stood
upon
clouds
that
the
sun
shone
on
and
the
clouds
dissunder
and
drown
in
thunder
the
news
that
will
never
be
lady
of
all
that
have
loved
the
people
light
over
roads
astray
maze
of
steading
and
street
and
steeple
great
as
a
heart
that
has
loved
the
people
stand
on
the
crown
of
the
soaring
down
lift
up
your
arms
and
pray
only
you
i
have
not
forgotten
for
wreck
of
the
renown
rending
and
ending
of
things
gone
rotten
only
the
face
of
you
unforgotten
and
your
head
upthrown
in
the
skies
alone
as
you
came
over
the
down
the
red
sea
our
souls
shall
be
leviathans
in
purple
seas
of
wine
when
drunkenness
is
dead
with
death
and
drink
is
all
divine
learning
in
those
immortal
vats
what
mortal
vineyards
mean
for
only
in
heaven
we
shall
know
how
happy
we
have
been
like
clouds
that
wallow
in
the
wind
be
free
to
drift
and
drink
tower
without
insolence
when
we
rise
without
surrender
sink
dreams
dizzy
and
crazy
we
shall
know
and
have
no
need
to
write
our
blameless
blasphemies
of
praise
our
nightmares
of
delight
for
so
in
such
misshapen
shape
the
vision
came
to
me
where
such
titanian
dolphins
dark
roll
in
a
sunset
sea
dark
with
dense
colours
strange
and
strong
as
terrible
true
love
haloed
like
fish
in
phospher
light
the
holy
monsters
move
measure
is
here
and
law
to
learn
when
honour
rules
it
so
to
lift
the
glass
and
lay
it
down
or
break
the
glass
and
go
but
when
the
new
deluge
boils
from
the
new
vine
our
souls
shall
be
leviathans
in
sanguine
seas
of
wine
for
a
war
memorial
suggested
inscription
probably
not
selected
by
the
committee
the
hucksters
haggle
in
the
mart
the
cars
and
carts
go
by
senates
and
schools
go
droning
on
for
dead
things
can
not
die
a
storm
stooped
on
the
place
of
tombs
with
bolts
to
blast
and
rive
but
these
be
names
of
many
men
the
lightning
found
alive
if
usurers
rule
and
rights
decay
and
visions
view
once
more
great
carthage
like
a
golden
shell
gape
hollow
on
the
shore
still
to
the
last
of
crumbling
time
upon
this
stone
be
read
how
many
men
of
england
died
to
prove
they
were
not
dead
memory
if
i
ever
go
back
to
baltimore
the
city
of
maryland
i
shall
miss
again
as
i
missed
before
a
thousand
things
of
the
world
in
store
the
story
standing
in
every
door
that
beckons
with
every
hand
i
shall
not
know
where
the
bonds
were
riven
and
a
hundred
faiths
set
free
where
a
wandering
cavalier
had
given
her
hundredth
name
to
the
queen
of
heaven
and
made
oblation
of
feuds
forgiven
to
our
lady
of
liberty
i
shall
not
travel
the
tracks
of
fame
where
the
war
was
not
to
the
strong
when
lee
the
last
of
the
heroes
came
with
the
men
of
the
south
and
a
flag
like
flame
and
called
the
land
by
its
lovely
name
in
the
unforgotten
song
if
ever
i
cross
the
sea
and
stray
to
the
city
of
maryland
i
will
sit
on
a
stone
and
watch
or
pray
for
a
child
that
was
there
one
day
and
the
child
will
never
come
back
to
play
and
will
understand
the
english
graves
were
i
that
wandering
citizen
whose
city
is
the
world
i
would
not
weep
for
all
that
fell
before
the
flags
were
furled
i
would
not
let
one
murmur
mar
the
trumpets
volleying
forth
how
god
grew
weary
of
the
kings
and
the
cold
hell
in
the
north
but
we
whose
hearts
are
homing
birds
have
heavier
thoughts
of
home
though
the
great
eagles
burn
with
gold
on
paris
or
on
rome
who
stand
beside
our
dead
and
stare
like
seers
at
an
eclipse
at
the
riddle
of
the
island
tale
and
the
twilight
of
the
ships
for
these
were
simple
men
that
loved
with
hands
and
feet
and
eyes
whose
souls
were
humbled
to
the
hills
and
narrowed
to
the
skies
the
hundred
little
lands
within
one
little
land
that
lie
where
severn
seeks
the
sunset
isles
or
sussex
scales
the
sky
and
what
is
theirs
though
banners
blow
on
warsaw
risen
again
or
ancient
laughter
walks
in
gold
through
the
vineyards
of
lorraine
their
dead
are
marked
on
english
stones
their
loves
on
english
trees
how
little
is
the
prize
they
win
how
mean
a
coin
for
how
small
a
shrivelled
lies
crumpled
here
and
curled
they
died
to
save
their
country
and
they
only
saved
the
world
nightmare
the
silver
and
violet
leopard
of
the
night
spotted
with
stars
and
smooth
with
silence
sprang
and
though
three
doors
stood
open
the
end
of
light
closed
like
a
trap
and
stillness
was
a
clang
under
the
leopard
sky
of
lurid
stars
i
strove
with
evil
sleep
the
hot
night
long
dreams
dumb
and
swollen
of
triumphs
without
wars
of
tongueless
trumpet
and
unanswering
gong
i
saw
a
pale
imperial
pomp
go
by
helmet
and
hornèd
mitre
and
heavy
wreath
their
high
strange
ensigns
hung
upon
the
sky
and
their
great
shields
were
like
the
doors
of
death
their
mitres
were
as
moving
pyramids
and
all
their
crowns
as
marching
towers
were
tall
their
eyes
were
cold
under
their
carven
lids
and
the
same
carven
smile
was
on
them
all
over
a
paven
plain
that
seemed
unending
they
passed
unfaltering
till
it
found
an
end
in
one
long
shallow
step
and
these
descending
fared
forth
anew
as
long
away
to
wend
i
thought
they
travelled
for
a
thousand
years
and
at
the
end
was
nothing
for
them
all
for
all
that
splendour
of
sceptres
and
of
spears
but
a
new
step
another
easy
fall
the
smile
of
stone
seemed
but
a
little
less
the
load
of
silver
but
a
little
more
and
ever
was
that
terraced
wilderness
and
falling
plain
paved
like
a
palace
floor
rust
red
as
gore
crawled
on
their
arms
of
might
and
on
their
faces
wrinkles
and
not
scars
till
the
dream
suddenly
ended
noise
and
light
loosened
the
tyranny
of
the
tropic
stars
but
over
them
like
a
subterranean
sun
i
saw
the
sign
of
all
the
fiends
that
fell
and
a
wild
voice
cried
and
be
done
is
there
no
steepness
in
the
stairs
of
hell
he
that
returns
he
that
remains
the
same
turned
the
round
real
world
his
iron
vice
down
the
grey
garden
paths
a
bird
called
twice
and
through
three
doors
mysterious
daylight
came
a
second
childhood
when
all
my
days
are
ending
and
i
have
no
song
to
sing
i
think
i
shall
not
be
too
old
to
stare
at
everything
as
i
stared
once
at
a
nursery
door
or
a
tall
tree
and
a
swing
wherein
ponderous
mercy
hangs
on
all
my
sins
and
me
because
he
does
not
take
away
the
terror
from
the
tree
and
stones
still
shine
along
the
road
that
are
and
can
not
be
men
grow
too
old
for
love
my
love
men
grow
too
old
for
wine
but
i
shall
not
grow
too
old
to
see
unearthly
daylight
shine
changing
my
dust
to
snow
till
i
doubt
if
it
be
mine
behold
the
crowning
mercies
melt
the
first
surprises
stay
and
in
my
dross
is
dropped
a
gift
for
which
i
dare
not
pray
that
a
man
grow
used
to
grief
and
joy
but
not
to
night
and
day
men
grow
too
old
for
love
my
love
men
grow
too
old
for
lies
but
i
shall
not
grow
too
old
to
see
enormous
night
arise
a
cloud
that
is
larger
than
the
world
and
a
monster
made
of
eyes
nor
am
i
worthy
to
unloose
the
latchet
of
my
shoe
or
shake
the
dust
from
off
my
feet
or
the
staff
that
bears
me
through
on
ground
that
is
too
good
to
last
too
solid
to
be
true
men
grow
too
old
to
woo
my
love
men
grow
too
old
to
wed
but
i
shall
not
grow
too
old
to
see
hung
crazily
overhead
incredible
rafters
when
i
wake
and
find
i
am
not
dead
a
thrill
of
thunder
in
my
hair
though
blackening
clouds
be
plain
still
i
am
stung
and
startled
by
the
first
drop
of
the
rain
romance
and
pride
and
passion
pass
and
these
are
what
remain
strange
crawling
carpets
of
the
grass
wide
windows
of
the
sky
so
in
this
perilous
grace
of
god
with
all
my
sins
go
i
and
things
grow
new
though
i
grow
old
though
i
grow
old
and
die
if
men
should
rise
and
return
to
the
noise
and
time
of
the
tourney
the
name
and
fame
of
the
tabard
the
tangle
of
gules
and
gold
would
these
things
stand
and
suffice
for
the
bourne
of
a
backward
journey
a
light
on
our
days
returning
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
old
nay
there
is
none
rides
back
to
pick
up
a
glove
or
a
feather
though
the
gauntlet
rang
with
honour
or
the
plume
was
more
than
a
crown
and
hushed
is
the
holy
trumpet
that
called
the
nations
together
and
under
the
horns
of
hattin
the
hope
of
the
world
went
down
ah
not
in
remembrance
stored
but
out
of
oblivion
starting
because
you
have
sought
new
homes
and
all
that
you
sought
is
so
because
you
had
trodden
the
fire
and
barred
the
door
in
departing
returns
in
your
chosen
exile
the
glory
of
long
ago
not
then
when
you
barred
the
door
not
then
when
you
trod
the
embers
but
now
at
your
new
end
you
have
seen
the
face
of
a
fate
that
not
as
a
child
looks
back
and
not
as
a
fool
remembers
all
that
men
took
too
lightly
and
all
that
they
love
too
late
it
is
you
that
have
made
no
rubric
for
saints
no
raiment
for
lovers
your
caps
that
cry
for
a
feather
your
roofs
that
sigh
for
a
spire
is
it
a
dream
from
the
dead
if
your
own
decay
discovers
alive
in
your
rotting
graveyard
the
worm
of
the
desire
therefore
the
old
trees
tower
that
the
green
trees
grow
and
are
stunted
therefore
these
dead
men
mock
you
that
you
the
living
are
dead
since
ever
you
battered
the
saints
and
the
tools
of
your
crafts
were
blunted
or
shattered
the
glass
in
its
glory
and
loaded
yourselves
with
the
lead
when
the
usurer
hunts
the
squire
as
the
squire
has
hunted
the
peasant
as
sheep
that
are
eaten
of
worms
where
men
were
eaten
of
sheep
now
is
the
judgment
of
earth
and
the
weighing
of
past
and
present
who
scorn
to
weep
over
ruins
behold
your
ruin
and
weep
have
ye
not
known
ye
fools
that
have
made
the
present
a
prison
that
thirst
can
remember
water
and
hunger
remember
bread
we
went
not
gathering
ghosts
but
the
shriek
of
your
shame
is
arisen
out
of
your
own
black
babel
too
loud
and
it
woke
the
dead
poland
augurs
that
watched
archaic
birds
such
plumèd
prodigies
might
read
the
eagles
that
were
the
eagle
that
was
black
indeed
and
when
the
went
down
and
in
their
track
the
vultures
come
we
know
what
pardon
and
what
peace
will
keep
our
little
masters
dumb
the
men
that
sell
what
others
make
as
vultures
eat
what
others
slay
will
prove
in
matching
plume
with
plume
that
naught
is
black
and
all
is
grey
grey
as
those
dingy
doves
that
once
by
palmed
and
priced
amid
the
crash
of
tables
flapped
and
huddled
from
the
wrath
of
christ
but
raised
for
ever
for
a
sign
since
god
made
anger
glorious
where
eagles
black
and
vultures
grey
flocked
back
about
the
heroic
house
where
war
is
holier
than
peace
where
hate
is
holier
than
love
shone
terrible
as
the
holy
ghost
an
eagle
whiter
than
a
dove
the
hunting
of
the
dragon
when
we
went
hunting
the
dragon
in
the
days
when
we
were
young
we
tossed
the
bright
world
over
our
shoulder
as
bugle
and
baldrick
slung
never
was
world
so
wild
and
fair
as
what
went
by
on
the
wind
never
such
fields
of
paradise
as
the
fields
we
left
behind
for
this
is
the
best
of
a
rest
for
men
that
men
should
rise
and
ride
making
a
flying
fairyland
of
market
and
wings
on
the
cottage
wings
on
the
wood
wings
upon
pot
and
pan
for
the
hunting
of
the
dragon
that
is
the
life
of
a
man
for
men
grow
weary
of
fairyland
when
the
dragon
is
a
dream
and
tire
of
the
talking
bird
in
the
tree
the
singing
fish
in
the
stream
and
the
wandering
stars
grow
stale
grow
stale
and
the
wonder
is
stiff
with
scorn
for
this
is
the
honour
of
fairyland
and
the
following
of
the
horn
beauty
on
beauty
called
us
back
when
we
could
rise
and
ride
and
a
woman
looked
out
of
every
window
as
wonderful
as
a
bride
and
the
as
a
tabard
blazed
and
the
children
cheered
and
ran
for
the
love
of
the
hate
of
the
dragon
that
is
the
pride
of
a
man
the
sages
called
him
a
shadow
and
the
light
went
out
of
the
sun
and
the
wise
men
told
us
that
all
was
well
and
all
was
weary
and
one
and
then
and
then
in
the
quiet
garden
with
never
a
weed
to
kill
we
knew
that
his
shining
tail
had
shone
in
the
white
road
over
the
hill
we
knew
that
the
clouds
were
flakes
of
flame
we
knew
that
the
sunset
fire
was
red
with
the
blood
of
the
dragon
whose
death
is
the
desire
for
the
horn
was
blown
in
the
heart
of
the
night
that
men
should
rise
and
ride
keeping
the
tryst
of
a
terrible
jest
never
for
long
untried
drinking
a
dreadful
blood
for
wine
never
in
cup

can

sonnet
high
on
the

jerusalem
i
saw
one
stand
under

when
i
perish
it
shall
not
be
known
whether
he
lived
some
strolling

great
ghost

the

the

vast

leaving

beat
down

back
to
the
groping

blind
as

back
to

drawing

my

turned
over

came
upright
and
i
came
out
where
the
old
road
shone
white
i
walked
the
ways
and
heard
what
all
men
said
forests
of
tongues
like
autumn
leaves
unshed
being
not
unlovable
but
strange
and
light
old
riddles
and
new

not
in

softly
as

smile
about
the

the

a

to
give

their

like
a

rattle
reason
out

a
sieve
that

lets
the

go
free

all

geography
the
earth
is
a
place
on
which
england
is
found
and
you
find
it
however
you
twirl
the
globe
round
for
the
spots
are
all
red
and
the
rest
is
all
grey
and
that
is
the
meaning
of

day
a
rock
that
you
see
very
plain
and
attached
to
its
base
is
the
district
of
spain
and
the
island
of
malta
is
marked
further
on
where
some
natives
were
known
as
the
knights
of
john
then
cyprus
and
east
to
the
suez
canal
that
was
conquered
by
dizzy
and
rothschild
his
pal
with
the
sword
of
the
lord
in
the
old
english
way
and
that
is
the
meaning

our
principal
imports
come
far
as
cape
horn
for

cocoa
for

corn
thus
brahmins
are
born
for

thus
the
gods
made
the
greeks
to
grow
currants
for
us
tobacco
and
petrol
and
jazzing
and

the
jazzing
will
pass
but
the
jews
they
will
stay

that
is
the
meaning

day
our
principal
exports
all
labelled
and
packed
at
the
ends
of
the
earth
are
delivered
intact
our
soap
or
our
salmon
can
travel
in
tins
between
the
two
poles
and
as
like
as
two
pins
so
that
lancashire
merchants
whenever
they
like
can
water
the
beer
of
a
man
in
klondike
or
poison
the
meat
of
a
man
in
bombay
and
that
is
the
meaning

the
day
of
george
is
a
musty
affair
which
russians
and
greeks
are
permitted
to
share
the
day
of
trafalgar
is
spanish
in

and
the
spaniards
refuse
to
pronounce
it
the
same
but
the
day
of
the
empire
from
canada
came
with
morden

iii
for
the
crêche
i
remember
my
mother
the
day
that
we
met
a
thing
i
shall
never
entirely
forget
and
i
toy
with
the
fancy
that
young
as
i
am
i
should
know
her
again
if
we
met
in
a
tram
but
mother
is
happy
in
turning
a
crank
that
increases
the
balance
at
bank
and
i
feel
satisfaction
that
mother
is
free
from
the
sinister
task
of
attending
to
me
they
have
brightened
our
room
that
is
spacious
and
cool
with
diagrams
used
in
the
idiot
school
and
books
for
the
blind
that
will
teach
us
to
see
but
mother
is
happy
for
mother
is
free
for
mother
is
dancing
up
floors
for
love
of
the
leeds
international
stores
and
the
flame
of
that
faith
might
perhaps
have
grown
cold
with
the
care
of
a
baby
of
seven
weeks
old
for
mother
is
happy
in
greasing
a
wheel
for
somebody
else
who
is
cornering
steel
and
though
our
one
meeting
was
not
very
long
she
took
the
occasion
to
sing
me
this
song
hush
thee
my
baby
the
time
soon
will
come
when
thy
sleep
will
be
broken
with
hooting
and
hum
there
are
handles
want
turning
and
turning
all
day
and
knobs
to
be
pressed
in
the
usual
way
o
hush
thee
