prefatory
note
the
poets
have
ever
been
lovers
of
books
indeed
one
might
ask
how
should
a
man
be
a
poet
who
did
not
admire
a
treasure
as
precious
and
as
beautiful
as
a
book
may
be
with
evident
enjoyment
keats

torn

a
glorious
folio
of
anacreon
and
it
was
a
glorious
folio
of
beaumont
and
fletcher
which
another
english
poet
whose
most
poetic
work
was
done
in
prose
dragged
home
late
at
night
from
barker
in
covent
garden
and
to
pacify
his
conscience
for
the
purchase
of
which
he
kept
to
his
overworn
suit
of
clothes
for
four
or
five
weeks
longer

he
ought
charles
lamb
was
a
true
bibliophile
in
the
earlier
and
more
exact
sense
of
the
term
he
loved
his
ragged
volumes
as
he
loved
his
and
he
was
as
intolerant
of
books
that
are
not
books
as
he
was
of
men
who
were
not
manly
he
conferred
the
dukedom
of
his
library
on
coleridge
who
was
no
respecter
of
books
though
he
could
not
but
enrich
them
with
his
marginal
notes
southey
and
lord
houghton
and
locker
are
english
poets
with
libraries
of
their
own
more
orderly
and
far
richer
than
the
fortuitous
congregation
of
printed
atoms

mere
medley
of
unrelated
tomes

often
masquerades

he
thought
southey
had
a
secret
in

one
of
his
books
which
he
was
afraid
the
stranger
might
discover
but
this
was
probably
no
more
and
no
other
than
the
secret
of
comfort
consolation
refreshment
and
happiness
to
be
found
in
any
library

him
who
shall
bring

lowell
has
recently
dwelt
on
the
difference
between
literature
and
books
and
accepting
this
distinction
the
editor
desires
to
declare
at
once
that
as
a
whole
this
collection
is
devoted
rather
to
books
than
to
literature
the
poems
in
the
following
pages
celebrate
the
of
the
one
rather
than
the
masterpieces
of
the
other
the
stanzas
here
garnered
into

of
books
as
books
of
books
valuable
and
valued
for
their
perfection
of
type
and
page
and
printing
for
their
beauty
and
for
their
rarity
or
for
their
association

this

here
if
errors
be
the
like
nay
worse
in
the
great
world
we
see
the
present
collection
of
varieties
in
verse
has
little
or
naught
to
do
with
the
great
world
and
its
errors
it
has
to
do
chiefly
not
to
say
wholly
with
the
world
of
the
bookmen
the
little
world
of
the
the
bibliophile
the
bibliomaniac
a
mad
world
my
masters
in
which
there
are
to
be
found
not
a
few
poets
who
cherish
old
wine
and
old
wood
old
friends
and
old
books
and
who
believe
that
old
books
are
the
best
of
old
friends
books
books
again

books
once
more
these
are
our
theme
which
some
miscall

madness

the

has
much
pleasure
in
thanking
the
poets
who
have
allowed
him
to
reprint
their
poems
in
these
pages

he
acknowledges
a
double
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
friends
who
have
written
poems
expressly
for

encouraged
by
their
support

remembering
that

is
not
a
contributor

the
editor
ventures
to
conclude
his

catalogue
of

not
contained
within

quoting

for
may
within

did
mortal
ever
see
a
critic
so
unprejudiced
so
full
of
mirthful
glee
just
watch
her
at
that
lower
shelf
see
there
she
thumped
her
nose
against
the
place
where
webster
stands
in
dignified
repose
such
heavy
books
she
scorns
and
she
considers
vapereau
and
beeton
too
though
full
of
life
quite
stupid
dull
and
slow
she
wants
to
take
a
higher
flight
aspiring
little
elf
and
on
her
mother
arm
at
length
she
gains
a
higher
shelf
but
oh
what
liberties
she
takes
with
those
grave
learnèd
men
historians
and
scientists
and
even
rare
old
ben
at
times
she
takes
a
spiteful
turn
and
pommels
with
her
fists
de
quincey
jeffrey
and
carlyle
and
other
essayists
and
when
her
wrath
is
fully
roused
and
she
disposed
for
strife
it
almost
looks
as
if
she
like
to
take
macaulay
again
in
sympathetic
mood
she
gayly
smiles
at
gay
and
punches
punch
and
frowns
at
sterne
in
quite
a
dreadful
way
in
vain
the
sermons
shake
their
heads
she
does
not
care
for
these
but
catches
with
intense
delight
at
all
the
tales
she
sees
where
authors
chance
to
meet
her
views
just
praise
they
never
lack
to
comfort
and
encourage
them

draught
is

before

be

are

in

i
find
the
art
of
laman
blanchard
his
works
how
hard
when
those
who
do
not
wish
to
lend
that
lose
their
books
are
snared
by
anglers
folks
that
fish
with
literary
hooks
who
call
and
take
some
favorite
tome
but
never
read
it
through
they
thus
complete
their
set
at
home
by
making
one
at
you
behold
the
bookshelf
of
a
dunce
who
borrows
never
lends
yon
work
in
twenty
volumes
once
belonged
to
twenty
friends
new
tales
and
novels
you
may
shut
from
view
is
all
in
vain
they
gone
and
though
the
leaves
are
cut
they
never
come
again
for
pamphlets
lent
i
look
around
for
tracts
my
tears
are
spilt
but
when
they
take
a
book
that
bound
is
surely
a
circulating
library
is
mine
my
birds
are
flown
there
one
odd
volume
left
to
be
like
all
the
rest
i
of
my
spenser
quite
bereft
last
winter
sore
was
shaken
of
lamb
i
but
a
quarter
left
nor
could
i
save
my
bacon
my
hall
and
hill
were
levelled
flat
but
moore
was
still
the
cry
and
then
although
i
threw
them
sprat
they
swallowed
up
my
pye
everything
however
slight
they
seized
some
airy
trammel
they
snatched
my
hogg
and
fox
one
night
and
pocketed
my
campbell
and
then
i
saw
my
crabbe
at
last
like
hamlet
backward
go
and
as
my
tide
was
ebbing
fast
of
course
i
lost
my
rowe
i
wondered
into
what
balloon
my
books
their
course
had
bent
and
yet
with
all
my
marvelling
soon
i
found
my
marvell
went
my
mallet
served
to
knock
me
down
which
makes
me
thus
a
talker
and
once
while
i
was
out
of
town
my
johnson
proved
a
walker
while
studying
the
fire
one
day
my
hobbes
amidst
the
smoke
they
bore
my
colman
clean
away
and
carried
off
my
coke
they
picked
my
locke
to
me
far
more
than
bramah
patent
worth
and
now
my
losses
i
deplore
without
a
home
on
earth
if
once
a
book
you
let
them
lift
another
they
conceal
for
though
i
caught
them
stealing
swift
as
swiftly
went
my
steele
hope
is
not
now
upon
my
shelf
where
late
he
stood
elated
but
what
is
strange
my
pope
himself
is
excommunicated
my
little
suckling
in
the
grave
is
sunk
to
swell
the
ravage
and
what
was
crusoe
fate
to
save
was
mine
to
lose
a
savage
even
glover
works
i
can
not
put
my
frozen
hands
upon
though
ever
since
i
lost
my
foote
my
bunyan
has
been
gone
my
hoyle
with
cotton
went
oppressed
my
taylor
too
must
sail
to
save
my
goldsmith
from
arrest
in
vain
i
offered
bayle
i
prior
sought
but
could
not
see
the
hood
so
late
in
front
and
when
i
turned
to
hunt
for
lee
oh
where
was
my
leigh
hunt
i
tried
to
laugh
old
care
to
tickle
yet
could
not
tickell
touch
and
then
alas
i
missed
my
mickle
and
surely
mickle
much
is
quite
enough
my
griefs
to
feed
my
sorrows
to
excuse
to
think
i
can
not
read
my
reid
nor
even
use
my
hughes
to
west
to
south
i
turn
my
head
exposed
alike
to
odd
jeers
for
since
my
roger
ascham
fled
i
ask
for
my
rogers
they
took
my
horne
and
horne
tooke
too
and
thus
my
treasures
flit
i
feel
when
i
would
hazlitt
view
the
flames
that
it
has
lit
my
word
worth
little
wordsworth
gone
if
i
survive
its
doom
how
many
a
bard
i
doated
on
was
swept
off
with
my
broome
my
classics
would
not
quiet
lie
a
thing
so
fondly
hoped
like
primrose
i
may
cry
my
livy
has
eloped
my
life
is
wasting
fast
away
i
suffer
from
these
shocks
and
though
i
fixed
a
lock
on
gray
there
gray
upon
my
locks
i
far
from
young
am
growing
pale
i
see
my
butter
fly
and
when
they
ask
about
my
is
burton
i
reply
they
still
have
made
me
slight
returns
and
thus
my
griefs
divide
for
oh
they
cured
me
of
my
burns
and
eased
my
akenside
but
all
i
think
i
shall
not
say
nor
let
my
anger
burn
for
as
they
never
found
me
gay
they
have
not
left

the

tall
lombardy
on

blows

shore

sweet
puffs
comes
stealing
fresh

october
dawn

lie

my
feet
lifted

swinging
free
the

old

i
laid
me
down
in
the
idle
summer
afternoons
with
you
alone
in
the
odorous
grass
and
set
your
thoughts
to
the
wind
low
tunes
and
saw
your
children
rise
up
and
pass
and
dreamed
and
dreamed
of
the

think
to
you

hardly

you
dressed
so
fine
fresh
from

a

sadly
neglected
copy
of

in

in

he
wrote
these

on

they
were

thee

even
i
half
afraid
they
brought
me
more
labor

pleasure
than

are
clamoring
still

they
not
paid

these

remain

too
many

would
that

no

sweated
out
thoughts
when
the

be

us

in

even

and
with

my

henry
wadsworth
longfellow
in
december
sadly
as
some
old
mediæval
knight
gazed
at
the
arms
he
could
no
longer
wield
the
sword
and
the
shining
shield
suspended
in
the
hall
and
full
in
sight
while
secret
longings
for
the
lost
delight
of
tourney
or
adventure
in
the
field
came
over
him
and
tears
but
half
concealed
trembled
and
fell
upon
his
beard
of
white
so
i
behold
these
books
upon
their
shelf
my
ornaments
and
arms
of
other
days
not
wholly
useless
though
no
longer
used
for
they
remind
me
of
my
other
self
younger
and
stronger
and
the
pleasant
ways
in
which
i
walked
now
clouded
and
confused
the

and

it
is
an
antique
room
with
casements
through
whose
purple
pane
unwilling
daylight
steals
amidst
the
gloom
shy
as
a
fearful
stranger
there
they
reign
in
loftier
pomp
than
waking

had
known
the
kings
of

not
crown
until
the
grave
when
agamemnon
sinks
into

mounts
the

ye

souls
who
rule
us
from

in

ye
breathe
all
that
divide
us
from
the
clod
ye
gave

the
sense
of
beauty

and
the
minstrel

what
were
our
wanderings
if
without
your

as

and

the
glory
ye
dispense
becomes
our

who
of

tell
what
he

hark
while
we
muse
without

is
heard
the
various
murmur
of
the
laboring
crowd
how
still
within
those
interr
the
calm
ones
reign
and
yet
they
rouse
the
loud
passions
and
tumults
of
the
circling
world
from
them
how
many
a
youthful
tully
caught
the
zest
and
ardor
of
the
eager
bar
from
them
how
many
a
young
ambition
sought
gay
meteors
glancing
the
sands
afar
by
them
each
restless
wing
has
been
unfurl
and
their
ghosts
urge
each
rival
rushing
car
they
made
yon
preacher
zealous
for
the
truth
they
made
yon
poet
wistful
for
the

fired
the

of

the

sires
of
all

now
so
still
this

is
thy

i
hear
it
beating
through

yet
thou
art

as
in

with
the
cnidian
vine
i
ope

and
behold
thy
spirit
meets
me
in
the
haunted
ground
sublime
and
eloquent
as
while
of
old
it
flamed
and
sparkled
in
its
crystal
bound
these
yourselves
your
life
of

the
wise
minstrel
or
sage
of
their

are
clay
but
their
books
as
from

they
rise
angels
that
side

upon

the

still
what
gives
this

to
the

the

scarce
wraps
the

at
once
there
cease
envy
and
hate
nine
cities
claim
him

the

what
the

that

such

distil

it

yet
to

ages

their

had
end
and
each
in
some

grave
lies
mixt
with

none
now
would
care
to
ask

what
they

though

their

all

well

the

let
the
weary

be
by

cooling

as
i
do
you
never
a
man
in

but
has
in
his
hour
of
need
a
friend
who
stretches
to
him
a

hand
and
stands
by
him
to
the
bitter
end
if
not
before
there
is
comfort
then
in
the
strong
companionship
of
men
but
better
than
that

friend
of
mine
is
the
love
of
woman
the

whether
in
maiden
eyes
it
shine

melts
in

of

of

a
country
squire
of
greater
wealth
than

for
fools
are
often
blessed
with
fortune
smile
had
built
a
splendid
house
and
furnished
it
in
splendid
style
one
thing
is
wanting
said
a
friend
for
though
the
rooms
are
fine
the
furniture
profuse
you
lack
a
library
dear
sir
for
show
if
not
for
use
is
true
but
replied
the
squire
with
glee
the
in
yonder
northern
wing
i
wonder
i
thought
of
it
will
be
the
very
thing
i
have
it
fitted
up
without
delay
with
shelves
and
presses
of
the
newest
mode
and
rarest
wood
befitting
every
way
a
squire
abode
and
when
the
whole
is
ready
i
dispatch
my
coachman
a
most
knowing
fellow
down
to
buy
me
by
admeasurement
a
batch
of
books
in
town
but
ere
the
library
was
half
supplied
with
all
its
pomps
of
cabinet
and
shelf
the
booby
squire
repented
him
and
cried
unto
himself
this
room
is
much
more
roomy
than
i
thought
ten
thousand
volumes
hardly
would
suffice
to
fill
it
and
would
cost
however
bought
a
plaguy
price
now
as
i
only
want
them
for
their
looks
it
might
on
second
thoughts
be
just
as
good
and
cost
me
next
to
nothing
if
the
books
were
made
of
wood
it
shall
be
so
i
give
the
shaven
deal
a
coat
of
paint
a
colorable
dress
to
look
like
calf
or
vellum
and
conceal
its
nakedness
and
gilt
and
lettered
with
the
author
name
whatever
is
most
excellent
and
rare
shall
be
or
seem
to
be
is
all
the
same
assembled
there
the
work
was
done
the
simulated
hoards
of
wit
and
wisdom
round
the
chamber
stood
in
binding
some
and
some
of
course
in
where
all
were
wood
from
bulky
folios
down
to
slender
twelves
the
choicest
tomes
in
many
an
even
row
displayed
their
lettered
backs
upon
the
shelves
a
goodly
show
with
such
a
stock
as
seemingly
surpassed
the
best
collection
ever
formed
in
spain
what
wonder
if
the
owner
grew
at
last
supremely
vain
what
wonder
as
he
paced
from
shelf
to
shelf
and
conned
their
titles
that
the
squire
began
despite
his
ignorance
to
think
himself
a
learned
man
every
amateur
who
merely
looks
to
backs
and
binding
take
the
hint
and
sell
his
costly
library
for
painted
books
would
serve
as
old

appendix
of

i
must
confess
i
love
old
books
the
dearest
too
perhaps
most
dearly
thick
clumpy
tomes
of
antique
looks
in
pigskin
covers
fashioned
queerly
clasped
chained
or
thonged
stamped
quaintly
too
with
figures
wondrous
strange
or
holy
men
and
women
and
cherubs
few
might
well
from
owls
distinguish
duly
i
love
books
that
saw
the
light
of
day
at
least
three
hundred
long
years
ago
and
look
with
awe
on
works
that
live
so
often
plundered
i
love
the
sacred
dust
the
more
it
clings
to
ancient
lore
enshrining
thoughts
of
the
dead
renowned
of
yore
embalmed
in
books
for

declining

always
handy
when
sinking
spirits
find
no
cure
in

or
brandy
in
these
old
books
more
soothing
far
than
balm
of

or

i
seek
an
antidote
for
care
of
which
most
men
indeed
have
plenty
five
hundred
times
at

i
said
my
wife
assures
me
i
would
never
buy
more
old
books
yet
lists
are
made
and
shelves
are
lumbered
more
than
ever
ah
that
our
wives
could
only
see
how
well
the
money
is
invested
in
these
old
books
which
seem
to
be
by
them
alas
so
much
detested
there
nothing
hath
enduring

except
old

old
truth
that
ever

want

the
unknown
poet
sent
this
poem
to
george
crabbe
who
saw
its
merit
befriended
its
author
and
procured
its
when
the
sad
soul
by
care
and
grief
oppressed
looks
round
the
world
but
looks
in
vain
for
rest
when
every
object
that
appears
in
view
partakes
her
gloom
and
seems
dejected
too
where
shall
affliction
from
itself
retire
where
fade
away
and
placidly
expire
alas
we
fly
to
silent
scenes
in
vain
care
blasts
the
honors
of
the
flowery
plain
care
veils
in
clouds
the
sun
meridian
beam
sighs
through
the
grove
and
murmurs
in
the
stream
for
when
the
soul
is
laboring
in
despair
in
vain
the
body
breathes
a
purer
air
no
sailor
sighs
for
slumbering
seas
he
dreads
the
tempest
but
invokes
the
breeze
on
the
smooth
mirror
of
the
deep
resides
reflected
woe
and
unruffled
tides
the
ghost
of
every
former
danger
glides
thus
in
the
calms
of
life
we
only
see
a
steadier
image
of
our
misery
but
lively
gales
and
gently
clouded
skies
disperse
the
sad
reflections
as
they
rise
and
busy
thoughts
and
little
cares
avail
to
ease
the
mind
when
rest
and
reason
fail
when
the
dull
thought
by
no
designs
employed
dwells
on
the
past
or
suffered
or
enjoyed
we
bleed
anew
in
every
former
grief
and
joys
departed
furnish
no
relief
not
hope
herself
with
all
her
flattering
art
can
cure
this
stubborn
sickness
of
the
heart
the
soul
disdains
each
comfort
she
prepares
and
anxious
searches
for
congenial
cares
those
lenient
cares
which
with
our
own
combined
by
mixed
sensations
ease
th
afflicted
mind
and
steal
our
grief
away
and
leave
their
own
behind
a
lighter
grief
which
feeling
hearts
endure
without
regret
nor
demand
a
cure
but
what
strange
art
what
magic
can
dispose
the
troubled
mind
to
change
its
native
woes
or
lead
us
willing
from
ourselves
to
see
others
more
wretched
more
undone
than
we
this
books
can
do
nor
this
alone
they
give
new
views
to

teach
us
how
to
live
they

grieved

stubborn

chastise
fools
they
admonish
and
confirm

their
aid
they
yield
to
all
they
never
shun
the
man
of
sorrow
nor
the
wretch
undone
unlike
the
hard
the
selfish
and
the
proud
they
fly
not
sullen

various

slumbers

happy
age
the

when

knew

when

and
none
were

nor

climes
would
avarice
roam
to
fetch
delights
for
luxury
at

bound
by
no
ties
which
kept
the
soul
in
awe
they
dwelt
at
liberty
and
love
was
law
mistaken
youth
each
nation
first
was
rude
each
man
a
cheerless
son
of
solitude
to
whom
no
joys
of
social
life
were
known
none
felt
a
care
that
was
not
all
his
own
or
in
some
languid
clime
his
abject
soul
bowed
to
a
little
tyrant
stern
control
a
slave
with

his
monarch
throne
he
raised
and
in
rude
song
his
ruder
idol
praised
the
meaner
cares
of
life
were
all
he
knew
bounded
his
pleasures
and
his
wishes
few
but
when
by
slow
degrees
the
arts
arose
and
science
wakened
from
her
long
repose
when
commerce
rising
from
the
bed
of
ease
ran
round
the
land
and
pointed
to
the
seas
when
emulation
born
with
jealous
eye
and
avarice
lent
their
spurs
to
industry
then
one
by
one
the
numerous
laws
were
made
those
to
control
and
these
to
succor
trade
to
curb
the
insolence
of
rude
command
to
snatch
the
victim
from
the
usurer
hand
to
awe
the
bold
to
yield
the
wronged
redress
and
feed
the

with
luxury
excess
like
some
vast
flood
unbounded
fierce
and
strong
his

leads
ungoverned

along
like

it
breaks
the

by

the

next
history

there
full

she

every

her

history
has
her

every

with
sceptic

marks
the

from

here
our

and
a

too
yet
in

see
how
states
arose
guarded
by
virtue
from
surrounding
foes
their
virtue
lost
and
of
their
triumphs
vain
lo
how
they
sunk
to
slavery
again
satiate
with

of

possessed
a

conspicuous
made
she

thus
speaks
the

that
paints
ambition
race
the
monarch
pride
his
glory
his
disgrace
the
headlong
course
that
maddening
heroes
run
how
soon
triumphant

how

undone
how

offer

to

melancholy
tale
lo
where
of
late
the
book
of
martyrs
stood
old
pious
tracts
and
bibles
bound
in
wood
there
such
the
taste
of
our
degenerate
age
stand
the
profane
delusions
of

virtue
owns
the
tragic
muse
a

fable
her

her

for
this
she
rules
all

now
the

it

pity
with

her

her

her

the

she

yield
applause

own
her

while
they

her

for

in

abhorred
of
all

triumph
when
the

thus
her

comedy
prevails
who
shoots
at
folly
for
her
arrow
fails
folly
by
dulness

the

harmless

the

unhurt
she

the

at

and
is
folly
still
yet
well
the

in

scenes
what
pride

stoop
to
what

how
formal
fools
the
farce
of

applaud
how
caution
watches
at
the
lips
of
fraud
the
wordy
variance
of
domestic
life
the
tyrant
husband
the
retorting
wife
the
snares
for
innocence
the
lie
of

and
the
smooth

habitual
masquerade
with

obtain
a
place
each

each

the

methinks
a

and
from
his
corselet
take
the
massy
keys
dukes
lords
and
knights
in
long
procession
move
released
from
bondage
with
my
virgin
love
she
comes
she
comes
in
all
the
charms
of
youth
unequalled
love
and
unsuspected
truth
ah
happy
he
who
thus
in
magic
themes
worlds
bewitched
in
early
rapture
dreams
where
wild
enchantment
waves
her
potent
wand
and
fancy
beauties
fill
her
fairy
land
where
doubtful
objects
strange
desires
excite
and
fear
and
ignorance
afford
delight
but
lost
for
ever
lost
to
me
these
joys
which
reason
scatters
and
which
time
destroys
too
dearly
bought
maturer
judgment
calls
my
busied
mind
from
tales
and
madrigals
my
doughty
giants
all
are
slain
or
fled
and
all
my
knights
blue
green
and
yellow
dead
no
more
the
midnight
fairy
tribe
i
view
all
in
the
merry
moonshine
tippling
dew
the
last
lingering
fiction
of
the
brain
the
churchyard
ghost
is
now
at
rest
again
and
all
these
wayward
wanderings
of
my
youth
fly
reason
power
and
shun
the
light
of
truth
with
fiction
then
does
real
joy
reside
and
is
our
reason
the
delusive
guide
is
it
then
right
to
dream
the
sirens
sing
or
mount
enraptured
on
the
dragon
wing
no
is
the
infant
mind

care
unknown
that
makes
th
imagined
paradise
its
own
soon
as
reflections
in
the
bosom
rise
light
slumbers
vanish
from
the
clouded
eyes
the
tear
and
smile
that
once
together
rose
are
then
divorced

head
and

are
foes
enchantment

the

thus
of
power
and

empire
vain
with
various
thoughts
my
mind
i

books
my
slaves
with
tyrant
hand
i
seize
pleased
with
the
pride
that
will
not
let
them

sudden
i
find
terrific
thoughts
arise
and
sympathetic
sorrow
fills
my
eyes
for
lo
while
yet
my
heart
admits
the
wound
i
see
the
critic
army
ranged
around
foes
to
our
race
if
ever
ye
have
known
a
father
fears
for
offspring
of
your
own
if
ever
smiling
a
lucky
line
ye
thought
the
sudden
sentiment
divine
then
paused
and
doubted
and
then
tired
of
doubt
with
rage
as
sudden
dashed
the
stanza
out
if
after
fearing
much
and
pausing
long
ye
ventured
on
the
world
your
labored
song
and
from
the
crusty
critics
of
those
days
implored
the
feeble
tribute
of
their
praise
remember
now
the
fears
that
moved
you
then
and
spite
of
truth
let
mercy
guide
your
pen
what
race
are
ours
what
mighty
foes
lie
waiting
all
around
them
to
oppose
what
treacherous
friends
betray
them
to
the
fight
what
dangers
threaten
them
yet
still
they
write
a
hapless
tribe
to
every
evil
born
whom
villains
hate
and
fools
affect
to
scorn
strangers
they
come
amid
a
world
of
woe
and
taste
the
largest
portion
ere
they
go
pensive
i
spoke
and
cast
mine
eyes
around
the
roof
methought
returned
a
solemn
sound
each
column
seemed
to
shake
and
clouds
like
smoke
from
dusty
piles
and
ancient
volumes
broke
gathering
above
like
mists
condensed
they
seem
exhaled
in
summer
from
the
rushy
stream
like
flowing
robes
they
now
appear
and
twine
round
the
large
members
of
a
form
divine
his
silver
beard
that
swept
his
aged
breast
his
piercing
eye
that
inward
light
expressed
were
seen
but
clouds
and
darkness
veiled
the
rest
fear
chilled
my
heart
to
one
of
mortal
race
how
awful
seemed
the
genius
of
the
place
so
in
cimmerian
shores
ulysses
saw
his
and
shrunk
in
pious
awe
like
him
i
stood
and
wrapped
in
thought
profound
when
from
the
pitying
power
broke
forth
a
solemn
sound
care
lives
with
all
no
rules
no
precepts
save
the
wise
from
woe
no
fortitude
the
brave
grief
is
to
man
as
certain
as
the
grave
tempests
and
storms
in
life
whole
progress
rise
and
hope
shines
dimly
through
skies
some
drops
of
comfort
on
the
favored
fall
but
showers
of
sorrow
are
the
lot
of
partial
to
talents
then
shall
heaven
withdraw
th
afflicting
rod
or
break
the
general
law
shall
he
who
soars
inspired
by
loftier
views
life
little
cares
and
little
pains
refuse
shall
he
not
rather
feel
a
double
share
of
mortal
woe
when
doubly
armed
to
bear
hard
is
his
fate
who
builds
his
peace
of
mind
on
the
precarious
mercy
of
mankind
who
hopes
for
wild
and
visionary
things
and
mounts
unknown
seas
with
wings
but
as
of
various
evils
that
befall
the
human
race
some
portion
goes
to
all
to
him
perhaps
the
milder
lot
assigned
who
feels
his
consolation
in
his
mind
and
locked
within
his
bosom
bears
about
a
mental
charm
for
every
care
without
in
the
pangs
of
each
domestic
grief
or
health
or
vigorous
hope
affords
relief
and
every
wound
the
tortured
bosom
feels
or
virtue
bears
or
some
preserver
heals
some
generous
friend
of
ample
power
possessed
some
feeling
heart
that
bleeds
for
the
distressed
some
breast
that
glows
with
virtues
all
divine
some
noble
rutland
misery
friend
and
thine
nor
say
the
muse
song
the
poet
pen
merit
the
scorn
they
meet
from
little
men
with
cautious
freedom
if
the
numbers
flow
not
wildly
high
nor
pitifully
low
if
vice
alone
their
honest
aims
oppose
why
so
ashamed
their
friends
so
loud
their
foes
happy
for
men
in
every
age
and
clime
if
all
the
sons
of
vision
dealt
in
rhyme
go
on
then
son
of
vision
still
pursue
thy
airy
dreams
the
world
is
dreaming
too
ambition
lofty
views
the
pomp
of
state
the
pride
of
wealth
the
splendor
of
the
great
stripped
of
their
mask
their
cares
and
troubles
known
are
visions
far
less
happy
than
thy
own
go
on
and
while
the
sons
of
care
complain
be
wisely
gay
and
innocently
vain
while
serious
souls
are
by
their
fears
undone
blow
sportive
bladders
in
the
beamy
sun
and
call
them
worlds
and
bid
the
greatest
show
more
radiant
colors
in
their
worlds
below
then
as
they
break
the
slaves
of
care
reprove
and
tell
them
such
are
all
the
toys
they
love
illustration
final
collector
to
his
books
of
mine
who
never
yet
have
caused
me
anguish
or
regret
save
when
some
fiend
in
human
shape
has
set
your
tender
sides
agape
or
soiled
with
some
unmanly
smear
the
whiteness
of
your
page
sincere

scored
you
with
some

inane

bantling
of

love
you

because
must
end
this
commerce
between

and

fate
to

all
i
supplicate
that
you
whom
i
have

long
may
not

vended
for
a

may
touch
some
croesus
if
there
should

that
you

unto

inevitable
day
