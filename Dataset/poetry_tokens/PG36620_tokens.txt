antinomies
on
a
railway
station
as
i
stand
waiting
in
the
rain
for
the
foggy
hoot
of
the
london
train
gazing
at
silent
wall
and
lamp
and
post
and
rail
and
platform
damp
what
is
this
power
that
comes
to
my
sight
that
i
see
a
night
without
the
night
that
i
see
them
clear
yet
look
them
through
the
silvery
things
and
the
darkly
blue
that
the
solid
wall
seems
soft
as
death
a
wavering
and
unanchored
wraith
and
rails
that
shine
and
stones
that
stream
unsubstantial
as
a
dream
what
sudden
door
has
opened
so
what
hand
has
passed
that
i
should
know
this
moving
vision
not
of
trance
that
melts
the
globe
of
circumstance
this
sight
that
marks
not
least
or
most
and
makes
a
stone
a
passing
ghost
is
it
that
a
year
ago
i
stood
upon
this
spot
is
it
that
since
a
year
ago
the
place
and
i
have
altered
not
is
it
that
i
half
forgot
a
year
ago
and
all
despised
for
a
space
the
things
that
i
had
prized
the
race
of
life
the
glittering
show
is
it
that
now
a
year
has
passed
of
vain
pursuit
of
glittering
things
of
fruitless
searching
shouting
running
and
greedy
lies
and
candour
cunning
here
as
i
stand
the
year
above
sudden
the
heats
and
the
strivings
fail
and
fall
away
a
fluctuant
veil
and
the
fixed
familiar
stones
restore
the
old
core
the
moveless
and
essential
me
the
eternal
personality
alone
enduring
first
and
last
no
this
i
have
known
in
other
ways
in
other
places
other
days
not
only
here
on
this
one
peak
do
fixity
and
beauty
speak
of
the
delusiveness
of
change
of
the
transparency
of
form
the
bootless
stress
of
minds
that
range
the
awful
calm
behind
the
storm
in
many
places
many
days
the
invaded
soul
receives
the
rays
of
countries
she
was
nurtured
in
speaks
in
her
silent
language
strange
to
that
beyond
which
is
her
kin
even
in
peopled
streets
at
times
a
metaphysic
arm
is
thrust
through
the
partitioning
fabric
thin
and
tears
away
the
darkening
pall
cast
by
the
bright
phenomenal
and
clears
the
obscured
spirit
mirror
from
shadows
of
deceptive
error
and
shows
the
bells
and
all
their
ringing
and
all
the
crowds
and
all
their
singing
carillons
that
are
nothing
chimes
and
dust
that
is
not
even
dust
but
rarely
hold
i
converse
thus
where
shapes
are
bright
and
clamorous
more
often
comes
the
word
divine
in
places
motionless
and
far
beneath
the
white
peculiar
shine
of
sunless
summer
afternoons
at
eventide
on
pale
lagoons
where
hangs
reflected
one
pale
star
or
deep
in
the
green
solitudes
of
still
erect
entrancèd
woods
o
in
the
woods
alone
lying
scarce
a
bough
in
the
wind
sighing
gaze
i
long
with
fervid
power
at
leaf
and
branch
and
grass
and
flower
breathe
i
breaths
of
trembling
sight
shed
from
great
urns
of
green
delight
take
i
draughts
and
drink
them
up
poured
from
many
a
stalk
and
cup
now
do
i
burn
for
nothing
more
than
thus
to
gaze
thus
to
adore
this
exquisiteness
of
nature
ever
in
silence
but
with
instant
light
rends
the
film
with
joy
i
quiver
to
see
with
new
celestial
sight
flower
and
leaf
and
grass
and
tree
doomed
barks
on
an
eternal
sea
flit
as
transient
smoke
beauty
herself
her
spell
has
broke
beauty
the
herald
and
the
lure
her
message
told
may
not
endure
her
portal
opened
she
has
died
supreme
immortal
suicide
yes
sleepless
nature
soundless
flings
invisible
grapples
round
the
soul
drawing
her
through
the
web
of
things
to
the
primal
end
of
her
journeyings
her
ultimate
and
constant
pole
for
beauty
with
her
hands
that
beckon
is
but
the
prophet
of
a
higher
a
flaming
and
ephemeral
beacon
a
phoenix
perishing
by
fire
herself
from
us
herself
estranges
herself
her
mighty
tale
doth
kill
that
all
things
change
yet
nothing
changes
that
all
things
move
yet
all
are
still
i
can
not
sink
i
can
not
climb
now
that
i
see
my
ancient
dwelling
the
central
orb
untouched
of
time
and
taste
a
peace
all
bliss
excelling
now
i
have
broken
beauty
wall
now
that
my
kindred
world
i
hold
i
care
not
though
the
cities
fall
and
the
green
earth
go
cold
the
three
hills
there
were
three
hills
that
stood
alone
with
woods
about
their
feet
they
dreamed
quiet
when
the
sun
shone
and
whispered
when
the
rain
beat
they
wore
all
three
their
coronals
till
men
with
houses
came
and
scored
their
heads
with
pits
and
walls
and
thought
the
hills
were
tame
red
and
white
when
day
shines
bright
they
hide
the
green
for
miles
where
are
the
old
hills
gone
at
night
the
moon
looks
down
and
smiles
she
sees
the
captors
small
and
weak
she
knows
the
prisoners
strong
she
hears
the
patient
hills
that
speak
brothers
it
is
not
long
brothers
we
stood
when
they
were
not
ten
thousand
summers
past
brothers
when
they
are
clean
forgot
we
shall
outlive
the
last
one
shall
die
and
one
shall
flee
with
terror
in
his
train
and
earth
shall
eat
the
stones
and
we
shall
be
alone
again
a
chant
gently
the
petals
fall
as
the
tree
gently
sways
that
has
known
many
springs
and
many
petals
fall
year
after
year
to
strew
the
green
deserted
ways
and
the
statue
and
the
pond
and
the
low
broken
wall
faded
is
the
memory
of
old
things
done
peace
floats
on
the
ruins
of
ancient
festival
they
lie
and
forget
in
the
warmth
of
the
sun
and
a
sky
arches
over
all
o
softly
o
tenderly
the
heart
now
stirs
with
desires
faint
and
formless
and
seeking
not
i
find
quiet
thoughts
that
flash
like
azure
across
the
luminous
tranquil
mirror
of
the
mind
artemis
altera
o
full
of
candour
and
compassion
whom
love
and
worship
both
would
praise
love
can
not
frame
nor
worship
fashion
the
image
of
your
fearless
ways
how
show
your
noble
brow
dark
pallor
your
chivalrous
casque
of
ebon
hair
your
eyes
bright
strength
your
lips
soft
valour
your
supple
shoulders
and
hands
that
dare
our
souls
when
naïvely
you
examine
your
sword
of
innocence
flaming
huge
sweeps
over
us
and
there
is
famine
within
the
ports
of
subterfuge
you
hate
contempt
and
love
not
laughter
with
your
sharp
spear
of
virgin
will
you
harry
the
wicked
strong
but
after
o
huntress
who
could
never
kill
should
they
be
trodden
down
or
pierced
swift
swift
you
fly
with
burning
cheek
to
place
your
beauty
shield
reversed
above
the
vile
defenceless
weak
starlight
last
night
i
lay
in
an
open
field
and
looked
at
the
stars
with
lips
sealed
no
noise
moved
the
windless
air
and
i
looked
at
the
stars
with
steady
stare
there
were
some
that
glittered
and
some
that
shone
with
a
soft
and
equal
glow
and
one
that
queened
it
over
the
sprinkled
round
swaying
the
host
with
silent
sound
calm
things
i
thought
in
your
cavern
blue
i
will
learn
and
hold
and
master
you
i
will
yoke
and
scorn
you
as
i
can
for
the
pride
of
my
heart
is
the
pride
of
a
man
grass
to
my
cheek
in
the
dewy
field
i
lay
quite
still
with
lips
sealed
and
the
pride
of
a
man
and
his
rigid
gaze
stalked
like
swords
on
heaven
ways
but
through
a
sudden
gate
there
stole
the
universe
and
spread
in
my
soul
quick
went
my
breath
and
quick
my
heart
and
i
looked
at
the
stars
with
lips
apart
florian
song
my
soul
it
shall
not
take
us
o
we
will
escape
this
world
that
strives
to
break
us
and
cast
us
to
its
shape
its
chisel
shall
not
enter
its
fire
shall
not
touch
hard
from
rim
to
centre
we
will
not
crack
or
smutch
words
sweet
and
flowered
we
have
an
amulet
we
will
not
play
the
coward
for
any
black
threat
if
we
but
give
endurance
to
what
is
now
within
the
single
assurance
that
it
is
good
to
win
slaves
think
it
better
to
be
weak
than
strong
whose
hate
is
a
fetter
and
their
love
a
thong
but
we
will
view
those
others
with
eyes
like
stone
and
if
we
have
no
brothers
we
will
walk
alone
dialogue
the
one
the
dead
man
gone
the
live
sad
the
dying
leaf
shakes
on
the
tree
the
wind
constrains
the
window
panes
and
moans
like
moaning
of
the
sea
and
sour
the
taste
now
culled
in
haste
of
lovely
things
i
won
too
late
and
loud
and
loud
above
the
crowd
the
voice
of
one
more
strong
than
we
the
other
this
voice
you
hear
this
call
you
fear
is
it
unprophesied
or
new
were
you
so
insolent
to
think
its
rope
would
never
circle
you
did
you
then
beastlike
live
and
walk
with
ears
and
eyes
that
would
not
turn
who
bade
you
hope
your
service
in
that
eternal
retinue
the
one
no
for
i
swear
now
bare
the
tree
and
loud
the
moaning
of
the
wind
i
walked
no
rut
with
eyelids
shut
my
ears
and
eyes
were
never
blind
only
my
eager
thoughts
i
bent
on
many
things
that
i
desired
to
make
my
greedy
heart
content
ere
flesh
and
blood
i
left
behind
the
other
ignorance
then
was
all
your
fault
and
filmèd
eyes
that
could
not
know
that
half
discerned
and
never
learned
the
temporal
way
that
men
must
go
you
set
the
image
of
the
world
high
for
your
heart
idolatry
though
with
your
lips
you
called
the
world
a
toy
a
ghost
a
passing
show
the
one
no
no
this
is
not
true
my
lips
spoke
only
what
my
heart
believed
called
i
the
world
a
toy
i
spoke
not
or
but
that
i
thought
the
toy
was
mine
to
play
with
and
the
passing
show
would
sate
at
least
my
passing
lusts
and
did
not
therefore
am
i
grieved
what
did
i
do
that
i
must
bear
this
lifelong
tyranny
of
my
fate
that
i
must
writhe
in
bonds
unsought
of
accidental
love
and
hate
had
chance
but
joinèd
different
dice
but
once
or
twice
but
once
or
twice
all
lovely
things
that
i
desired
i
should
have
held
before
too
late
surely
i
knew
that
flesh
was
grass
nor
valued
overmuch
the
prize
but
all
the
powers
of
chance
conspired
to
cheat
a
man
both
just
and
wise
happy
i
been
had
i
but
had
my
due
reward
and
not
a
sword
flaming
in
diabolic
hand
between
me
and
my
paradise
the
other
no
hooded
band
of
fates
did
stand
your
heart
ambitions
to
gainsay
no
flaming
brand
in
evil
hand
was
ever
thrust
across
your
way
only
the
things
all
men
must
meet
the
common
attributes
of
men
that
men
may
flinch
to
see
or
seeing
deny
but
avoid
them
no
man
may
fall
the
dice
not
once
or
twice
but
always
to
make
the
sum
chance
what
may
a
life
a
life
and
to
a
single
goal
must
come
though
a
man
search
far
and
wide
never
is
hunger
satisfied
nature
brings
her
natural
fetters
man
is
meshed
and
the
wise
are
dumb
o
vain
all
art
to
assuage
a
heart
with
accents
of
a
mortal
tongue
all
earthly
words
are
incomplete
and
only
sweet
are
the
songs
unsung
never
yet
was
cause
for
regret
yet
regret
must
afflict
us
all
better
it
were
to
grasp
the
world
which
this
world
is
a
curtain
flung
crepuscular
no
creature
stirs
in
the
wide
fields
the
rifted
western
heaven
yields
the
dying
sun
illumination
this
is
the
hour
of
tribulation
when
with
clear
sight
of
eve
engendered
day
homage
to
delusion
rendered
mute
at
her
window
sits
the
soul
clouds
and
skies
and
lakes
and
seas
valleys
and
hills
and
grass
and
trees
sun
moon
and
stars
all
stand
to
her
limbs
of
one
lordless
challenger
who
without
deigning
taunt
or
frown
throws
a
perennial
gauntlet
down
come
conquer
me
and
take
thy
toll
no
cowardice
or
fear
she
knows
but
as
once
more
she
girds
there
grows
an
unresignèd
hopelessness
from
memory
of
former
stress
head
bent
she
muses
whilst
he
waits
how
with
such
weapons
dint
his
plates
how
quell
this
vast
and
sleepless
giant
calmly
immortally
defiant
how
fell
him
bind
him
and
control
with
a
silver
cord
and
a
golden
bowl
at
night
dark
firtops
foot
the
moony
sky
blue
moonlight
bars
the
drive
here
at
the
open
window
i
sit
smoking
and
alive
wind
in
the
branches
swells
and
breaks
like
ocean
on
a
beach
deep
in
the
sky
and
my
heart
there
wakes
a
thought
i
can
not
reach
for
music
death
in
the
cold
grey
morning
came
to
the
man
where
he
lay
and
the
wind
shivered
and
the
tree
shuddered
and
the
dawn
was
grey
and
the
face
of
the
man
was
grey
in
the
dawn
and
the
watchers
by
the
bed
knew
as
they
heard
the
shaking
of
the
leaves
that
the
man
was
dead
the
roof
i
when
the
clouds
hide
the
sun
away
the
tall
slate
roof
is
dull
and
grey
and
when
the
rain
adown
it
streams
is
polished
lead
with
gleams
when
the
clouds
vanish
and
the
rain
stops
and
the
sun
comes
out
again
it
shimmers
golden
in
the
sun
almost
too
bright
to
look
upon
but
soon
beneath
the
steady
rays
the
roof
is
dried
and
reft
of
blaze
is
dusty
yellow
traversed
through
by
long
thin
lines
of
deepest
blue
then
at
the
last
as
night
draws
near
the
lines
grow
faint
and
disappear
the
roof
becomes
a
purple
mist
a
great
square
darkening
amethyst
which
sinks
into
the
gathering
shade
till
separate
form
and
colour
fade
and
it
is
but
a
patch
which
mars
the
beauty
of
a
field
of
stars
ii
it
stands
so
lonely
in
the
sky
the
sparrows
never
come
anigh
the
glossy
starlings
seldom
stop
to
preen
and
chatter
on
the
top
for
a
whole
week
sometimes
up
there
no
stirs
the
quiet
air
the
roof
lies
silent
and
serene
as
though
no
life
had
ever
been
till
some
bright
afternoon
athwart
the
edge
two
sudden
shadows
dart
and
two
white
pigeons
with
pink
feet
flutter
above
and
pitch
on
it
jerking
their
necks
out
as
they
walk
they
talk
awhile
their
a
low
continuous
murmur
blent
of
mock
reproaches
and
content
then
cease
and
sit
there
warm
and
white
an
hour
till
in
the
fading
light
they
wake
and
know
the
close
of
day
flutter
above
and
fly
away
leaving
the
roof
whereon
they
sat
as
was
before
a
peaceful
flat
expanse
as
silent
and
serene
as
though
no
life
had
ever
been
treetops
there
beyond
my
window
ledge
heaped
against
the
sky
a
hedge
of
huge
and
wavering
treetops
stands
with
multitudes
of
fluttering
hands
wave
they
beat
they
to
and
fro
never
stillness
may
they
know
plunged
by
the
wind
and
hurled
and
torn
anguished
purposeless
forlorn
o
ferocious
o
despairing
in
huddled
isolation
faring
through
a
scattered
universe
lost
coins
from
the
almighty
purse
no
below
you
do
not
see
the
firm
foundations
of
the
tree
anchored
to
a
rock
beneath
we
laugh
in
the
hammering
tempest
teeth
boughs
like
men
but
burgeons
are
on
an
adamantine
star
men
are
myriad
blossoms
on
a
staunch
and
cosmic
skeleton
in
the
park
this
dense
hard
ground
i
tread
these
iron
bars
that
ripple
past
will
they
unshaken
stand
when
i
am
dead
and
my
deep
thoughts
outlast
is
it
my
spirit
slips
falls
like
this
leaf
i
kick
aside
this
firmness
that
i
feel
about
my
lips
is
it
but
empty
pride
mute
knowledge
conquers
me
i
contemplate
them
as
they
are
faint
earth
and
shadowy
bars
that
shake
and
flee
less
hard
more
transient
far
than
those
unbodied
hues
the
sunset
flings
on
the
calm
river
and
as
i
look
a
swiftness
thrills
my
shoes
and
my
hands
with
empire
quiver
now
light
the
ground
i
tread
i
walk
not
now
but
rather
float
clear
but
unreal
is
the
scene
outspread
pitiful
thin
remote
poor
vapour
is
the
grass
so
frail
the
trees
and
railings
seem
that
did
i
sweep
my
hand
around
pass
through
them
as
in
a
dream
godlike
i
fear
no
changes
shatter
the
world
with
thunders
loud
still
would
i
flit
about
the
ranges
of
dark
and
ruddy
cloud
song
there
is
a
wood
where
the
fairies
dance
all
night
long
in
a
ring
of
mushrooms
daintily
by
each
tree
bole
sits
a
squirrel
or
a
mole
and
the
moon
through
the
branches
darts
light
on
the
grass
their
slim
limbs
glance
their
shadows
in
the
moonlight
swing
in
quiet
unison
and
the
moon
discovers
that
they
all
have
lovers
but
they
never
break
their
hearts
they
never
grieve
at
all
for
sands
that
run
they
never
know
regret
for
a
deed
that
done
and
they
never
think
of
going
to
a
shed
with
a
gun
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
town
mostly
in
a
dull
rotation
we
bear
our
loads
and
eat
and
drink
and
sleep
feeling
no
tears
knowing
no
meditation
too
tired
to
think
too
clogged
with
earth
to
weep
dimly
convinced
poor
groping
wretches
like
eyeless
insects
in
a
murky
pond
that
out
and
out
this
city
stretches
away
away
and
there
is
no
beyond
no
larger
earth
no
loftier
heaven
no
cleaner
gentler
airs
to
breathe
and
yet
even
to
us
sometimes
is
given
visions
of
things
we
otherwhiles
forget
some
day
is
done
its
labour
ended
and
as
we
brood
at
windows
high
a
steady
wind
from
far
descended
blows
off
the
filth
that
hid
the
deeper
sky
there
are
the
empty
waiting
spaces
we
watch
we
watch
unwinking
pale
and
dumb
till
gliding
up
with
noiseless
paces
night
sweeps
all
the
wide
arch
night
has
come
not
that
sick
false
night
of
the
city
lurid
and
low
and
yellow
and
obscene
but
mother
night
pure
full
of
pity
the
night
blue
potent
and
serene
o
as
we
gaze
the
clamour
ceases
the
turbid
world
around
grows
dim
and
small
the
influence
releases
our
shrouded
spirits
from
their
dusty
pall
no
more
we
hear
the
turbulent
traffic
not
scorned
but
unremembered
is
the
day
the
night
all
luminous
and
seraphic
has
brushed
its
heavy
memories
away
the
great
blue
night
so
clear
and
kindly
the
little
stars
so
and
so
still
open
a
door
for
souls
that
blindly
had
wandered
tunnelling
the
endless
hill
they
draw
the
portal
our
souls
slip
out
and
tremble
and
expand
the
immortal
feels
for
the
immortal
the
eternal
holds
the
eternal
by
the
hand
impalpably
we
are
led
and
lifted
softly
we
shake
into
the
gulf
of
blue
the
last
environing
veil
is
rifted
and
lost
horizons
float
into
our
view
lost
lands
lone
seas
lands
that
afar
gleam
with
a
miraculous
beauty
faint
yet
clear
forgotten
lands
of
night
and
seas
that
are
somewhere
but
that
are
not
here
borne
without
effort
or
endeavour
swifter
and
more
ethereal
than
the
wind
in
level
track
we
stream
whilst
ever
the
fair
pale
panorama
rolls
behind
now
fleets
below
a
trancèd
moorland
a
sweep
of
glimmering
immobility
now
craggy
cliff
and
dented
foreland
pass
back
and
there
beyond
unfolds
the
sea
now
wastes
of
water
heaving
drawing
great
darkling
tracts
of
patterned
restlessness
with
whitened
waves
round
rough
rocks
mawing
and
licking
islands
in
their
fierce
caress
now
coasts
with
capes
and
ribboned
beaches
set
silent
the
canopy
sapphirine
and
estuaries
and
river
reaches
phantasmal
silver
in
the
night
soft
shine
ah
these
fair
woods
the
spirit
crosses
these
quiet
lakes
these
stretched
dreaming
fields
these
undulate
downs
with
piny
bosses
pointing
the
ridges
of
their
sloping
shields
these
valleys
and
these
heights
that
screen
them
these
tawnier
sands
where
grass
and
tree
are
not
ah
we
have
known
them
we
have
seen
them
long
long
ago
or
ever
we
forgot
we
know
them
all
these
placid
countries
and
what
the
pathway
is
and
what
the
goal
these
are
the
gates
and
these
the
sentries
that
guard
the
ancient
fortress
of
the
soul
and
onward
speed
we
flying
flying
over
the
sundering
worlds
of
hill
and
plain
to
where
they
rear
their
heads
undying
the
unnamed
mountains
of
old
days
again
the
snows
upon
their
calm
still
summits
the
chasms
the
lines
of
trees
that
foot
the
snow
curving
like
inky
frozen
comets
into
the
spread
below
the
glisten
where
the
peaks
are
hoarest
the
soundless
darkness
of
the
sunken
vales
the
folding
leagues
of
shadowy
forest
wave
beyond
wave
till
all
distinctness
fails
so
invulnerable
it
is
so
deathless
so
floods
the
air
the
loveliness
of
it
that
we
stay
dazzled
rapt
and
breathless
our
beings
ebbing
to
the
infinite
there
as
we
pause
there
as
we
hover
moveless
in
ecstasy
a
sudden
light
breaks
in
our
eyes
and
we
discover
we
sit
at
windows
gazing
to
the
night
wistful
and
tired
with
eyes
where
still
the
sting
of
beauty
faintly
smarts
but
with
our
mute
regrets
there
mingle
thanks
for
the
resurrection
of
our
hearts
o
night
so
great
that
will
not
mock
us
o
stars
so
wise
that
understand
the
weak
o
vast
consoling
hands
that
rock
us
o
strong
and
perfect
tongues
that
speak
o
night
enrobed
in
azure
splendour
o
whispering
stars
whose
radiance
falls
like
dew
o
mighty
presences
and
tender
you
have
given
us
back
the
dreams
our
childhood
knew
lulled
by
your
visions
without
number
we
seek
our
beds
content
and
void
of
pain
and
dreaming
drowse
and
dreaming
slumber
and
dreaming
wake
to
see
the
day
again
a
memorial
the
cord
broke
and
the
tent
slipped
and
the
silken
roof
lay
prone
beneath
the
viewless
hoof
of
the
deliberate
firmament
yet
cared
we
not
how
should
we
care
knowing
that
labourless
now
he
breathes
a
golden
paradisal
air
where
with
more
certain
craft
he
wreathes
bright
braids
of
words
more
wise
and
fair
than
ever
his
earthly
fabrics
were
that
his
unwavering
eyes
made
fresh
purged
and
regarbed
in
fadeless
flesh
what
he
then
darkly
guessed
behold
and
watch
with
an
abiding
joy
the
eternal
mysteries
unfold
which
do
his
now
transfigured
songs
evermore
employ
brother
yet
great
thy
power
thou
as
on
a
tower
small
the
stars
yet
high
above
the
fields
in
thy
alembic
song
imagination
strong
distilled
what
essences
the
quest
to
mortals
yields
this
thy
reward
for
every
morning
sun
found
thy
heart
firm
allegiance
still
unshaken
no
temporal
ache
or
smart
drave
beauty
from
thy
heart
and
by
thy
mighty
mistress
never
wast
forsaken
yes
for
though
stringent
was
the
test
when
that
thy
trial
was
bitterest
steadfast
thou
remain
unshod
the
harrows
of
pain
thy
feet
once
trod
humiliate
as
thy
sad
song
tells
before
the
vault
white
sentinels
friendless
and
faint
thou
there
a
bowed
brave
timid
wanderer
a
lonely
nomad
of
the
spirit
who
did
a
triple
curse
inherit
hunger
regret
and
memory
yet
never
did
they
vanquish
thee
when
nighest
broken
most
alone
thy
unassuagèd
thoughts
could
clamber
to
beauty
on
her
ageless
throne
thou
wert
as
one
in
torture
chamber
who
sees
the
blue
through
an
open
casement
and
hammers
his
soul
to
endure
the
time
of
his
corporeal
abasement
nor
at
thine
or
others
fault
but
with
grim
tenderness
did
salt
thy
cicatrices
with
a
rhyme
not
the
most
sable
flame
of
gloom
could
penetrate
thy
inmost
room
but
through
the
walls
thy
spirit
sucked
into
that
cloistral
hermitage
stray
lovely
things
moonbeams
and
snows
the
far
sky
shed
into
thy
cage
and
from
the
very
gutter
plucked
a
lost
and
mired
campestral
rose
ended
that
purgatorial
period
filled
was
thy
wallet
and
thy
feet
were
shod
the
leaden
weights
were
moved
the
rack
withdrawn
thou
didst
traverse
the
dewy
fields
of
dawn
watch
sunsets
blazoning
over
upland
turf
pull
poppies
from
the
frontiers
of
the
surf
with
love
and
human
eyes
vigilant
calm
and
wise
but
still
as
when
thy
bark
did
ride
derelict
on
the
city
tide
as
then
for
penury
now
for
pride
thy
bodily
senses
were
denied
though
they
cried
out
and
would
not
sleep
ascetic
thou
didst
armour
them
lest
acid
pleasure
should
eat
thine
art
pure
gem
hourly
the
tempter
ambuscades
but
thou
didst
guard
the
gates
and
keep
thy
senses
hungry
colonnades
accessible
but
to
beauty
ministers
unlit
by
any
ruby
flame
but
hers
immuring
so
thy
spirit
eager
within
a
body
frail
and
meagre
far
from
the
meads
of
earthly
milk
and
honey
yet
franchised
of
more
wondrous
territories
like
those
poor
bedouin
of
arabia
the
stony
who
roam
and
but
free
by
day
to
wander
and
by
night
to
camp
in
vast
serenity
compassed
by
god
great
silent
glories
the
sun
gold
splendour
and
the
moon
white
lamp
folded
and
safe
from
harm
beneath
the
mighty
sky
protecting
arm
ha
but
the
titan
ardour
wherewith
thou
the
vast
to
spoil
the
starry
larder
of
fruits
of
heavenly
taste
urania
fiercest
servant
with
thirst
as
furnace
fervent
and
serene
burning
brow
worthy
of
thy
great
lineage
thou
drankest
without
a
shudder
in
proud
humility
milk
from
that
vast
primæval
udder
that
swells
for
such
as
thee
milk
from
the
fountains
of
the
universe
that
cowards
deem
infected
with
a
curse
that
flushes
him
who
drinks
nor
shrinks
the
exalted
anguish
of
diurnal
draughts
to
a
clear
vision
more
intolerable
in
its
blissful
pain
than
love
most
ardent
shafts
of
the
seats
where
she
doth
dwell
she
whom
thou
didst
confess
enticed
thee
hot
to
her
throne
to
press
for
the
greater
glory
of
christ
to
uplift
the
curtains
of
her
closed
eyes
not
all
was
for
thy
learning
nor
any
mortal
else
only
for
thy
discerning
sporadic
syllables
of
those
supernal
glances
coffer
of
which
her
marble
countenance
is
yet
vain
was
not
the
adventure
reluctant
though
the
prize
thou
gainedst
a
debenture
on
the
fringe
of
beauty
eyes
such
fragmentary
trophy
as
some
knight
from
saladin
or
sophy
may
have
won
in
sword
despite
not
the
dear
polar
shrines
held
captive
by
the
paynim
but
still
as
fruit
of
wars
some
stone
from
sion
lines
some
relic
that
might
sain
him
of
life
uncounted
scars
anchorite
never
disdainful
of
the
dust
but
conscious
of
the
overcoming
night
that
must
engulph
the
blooms
and
berries
of
lust
and
unforgetful
of
the
enveloping
day
beyond
though
a
sweet
show
was
spread
for
thy
delight
resolved
not
to
be
so
fond
as
in
ephemeral
gauds
caparisoned
to
station
feet
upon
a
world
of
vapour
soft
as
a
dream
and
fleeting
as
a
taper
thou
thoughtest
nevertheless
that
thou
shouldst
occupy
thyself
as
it
seemed
to
thee
most
worthily
until
the
rapid
hour
when
thou
shouldst
die
so
in
a
world
of
seemings
of
shadows
and
of
dreamings
busied
thyself
to
fashion
and
record
unto
the
greater
glory
of
thy
lord
for
thy
proud
lady
beauty
his
most
excellent
and
humble
handmaid
is
says
one
thy
service
was
too
ceremonial
thy
vestments
irised
overmuch
thy
ritual
too
elaborate
and
thy
rubric
too
obscure
therefore
thy
gift
of
chant
and
orison
beneath
the
perfect
service
men
have
done
o
but
thy
notes
were
pure
and
in
a
day
like
this
we
now
endure
no
fault
it
was
in
thee
to
set
thy
camp
remote
aloof
aloof
in
a
far
fastness
proof
the
mephitic
odours
of
the
swamp
which
being
so
no
gain
to
explain
an
exquisiteness
too
meticulous
let
us
but
say
it
pleased
thee
thus
dowered
with
imagination
to
raise
a
column
garlanded
and
fluted
for
him
thy
heavenly
abacus
this
was
thine
offering
thou
didst
make
in
founded
hope
that
he
the
craftsman
best
would
take
well
knowing
its
unobscure
sincerity
the
cord
broke
and
the
tent
slipped
and
the
silken
roof
lay
prone
beneath
the
viewless
hoof
of
the
deliberate
firmament
we
still
in
this
terrene
abode
forlorn
must
tread
the
difficult
road
and
all
meek
thanks
and
all
belief
hardly
suffice
to
rampart
grief
for
gone
is
beauty
votary
apostolic
and
are
her
temples
now
delivered
over
to
blindworms
and
libidinous
goats
that
frolic
in
places
hallowed
by
that
celestial
lover
save
only
two
or
three
with
undivided
minds
like
thee
none
now
remains
that
girds
the
peregrinal
loin
none
reverent
of
beauty
holy
tongue
but
counterfeiters
of
her
imaged
coin
iconoclasts
breakers
of
carven
words
seekers
of
worthless
treasure
in
the
dung
mock
mages
and
cacophonous
charlatans
and
pismire
artisans
labouring
to
make
such
mirrored
replicas
of
nature
face
as
might
the
surface
of
a
stagnant
lake
yet
we
should
anger
not
nor
let
that
be
forgot
the
testament
of
stateliest
worth
he
left
us
when
he
fled
the
earth
the
mausoleum
made
of
rhyme
fair
in
its
unfrequented
field
which
shall
invulnerably
shield
his
memory
to
the
end
of
time
the
house
with
halls
and
roof
of
gold
and
jewelled
walls
for
which
the
fisher
sank
his
net
into
the
deepest
pools
of
speech
scooping
rich
conchs
and
ribbons
wet
that
a
less
venturous
could
not
reach
the
hunter
tracked
the
metaphor
on
many
a
foamy
silver
coast
a
hundred
leagues
beyond
the
most
fabulous
tellurian
shore
magnificent
he
was
and
mild
glad
to
be
still
and
glad
to
speak
daring
yet
delicate
as
a
child
faithful
compassionate
and
holy
and
being
human
strong
and
weak
and
full
of
hope
and
melancholy
no
more
than
we
able
to
shed
man
nature
he
inherited
neither
sin
garrison
to
kill
yet
at
the
last
with
constancy
so
great
as
the
world
vanities
to
abnegate
sternly
to
will
the
sacrifice
of
will
upon
the
altars
of
the
uncreate
so
that
he
lived
before
he
died
as
one
who
hourly
to
himself
denied
all
joys
save
those
that
can
not
pall
who
having
nothing
yet
had
all
friendship
garland
i
when
i
was
a
boy
there
was
a
friend
of
mine
we
thought
ourselves
warriors
and
grown
folk
swine
stupid
old
animals
who
never
understood
and
never
had
an
impulse
and
said
you
must
be
good
we
slank
like
stoats
and
fled
like
foxes
we
put
cigarettes
in
the
lighted
cigarettes
and
letters
all
aflame
o
the
surprise
when
the
postman
came
we
stole
eggs
and
apples
and
made
fine
hay
in
people
houses
when
people
were
away
we
broke
street
lamps
and
away
we
ran
then
i
was
a
boy
but
now
i
am
a
man
now
i
am
a
man
and
do
have
any
fun
i
hardly
ever
shout
and
i
never
never
run
and
i
do
care
if
he
dead
that
friend
of
mine
for
then
i
was
a
boy
and
now
i
am
a
swine
ii
we
met
again
the
other
night
with
people
you
were
quite
polite
shook
my
hand
and
spoke
awhile
of
common
things
with
cautious
smile
paid
the
usual
debt
men
owe
to
fellows
whom
they
used
to
know
but
when
our
eyes
met
full
yours
dropped
and
sudden
resolute
you
stopped
moving
with
hurried
syllables
to
make
remarks
to
some
one
else
i
caught
them
not
to
me
they
said
let
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
things
were
very
different
then
boys
are
fools
and
men
are
men
several
times
the
other
night
you
did
your
best
to
be
polite
when
in
the
conversation
round
you
heard
my
tongue
familiar
sound
you
bent
in
eager
pose
my
way
to
hear
what
i
had
got
to
say
trying
you
thought
with
some
success
to
hide
the
chasm
nakedness
but
on
your
eyes
hard
films
there
lay
no
no
pretence
could
veil
your
blank
indifference
and
if
thoughts
came
recalling
things
from
those
old
springs
when
underneath
the
moon
and
sun
our
separate
pulses
beat
as
one
vagrant
tender
thoughts
that
asked
admittance
found
the
portal
masked
you
spurned
them
when
i
said
my
say
with
laugh
and
nod
you
turned
away
to
toss
your
friends
some
easy
jest
that
smote
my
brow
and
stabbed
my
breast
foolish
though
it
be
and
vain
i
am
not
master
of
my
pain
and
when
i
said
to
you
i
hoped
we
should
not
meet
again
and
wondered
how
the
soul
i
knew
could
change
so
much
have
i
changed
too
iii
there
was
a
man
whom
i
knew
well
whose
choice
it
was
to
live
in
hell
reason
there
was
why
that
was
so
but
what
it
was
i
do
not
know
he
had
a
room
high
in
a
tower
and
sat
there
drinking
hour
by
hour
drinking
drinking
all
alone
with
candles
and
a
wall
of
stone
now
and
then
he
sobered
down
and
stayed
a
night
with
me
in
town
if
he
found
me
with
a
crowd
he
shrank
and
did
not
speak
aloud
he
sat
in
a
corner
silently
and
others
of
the
company
would
note
his
curious
face
and
eye
his
twitching
face
and
timid
eye
when
they
saw
the
eye
he
had
they
thought
perhaps
that
he
was
mad
i
knew
he
was
clear
and
sane
but
had
a
horror
in
his
brain
he
had
much
money
and
one
friend
and
drank
quite
grimly
to
the
end
why
he
chose
to
die
in
hell
i
did
not
ask
he
did
not
tell
lines
when
london
was
a
little
town
lean
by
the
river
marge
the
poet
paced
it
with
a
frown
he
thought
it
very
large
he
loved
bright
ship
and
pointing
steeple
and
bridge
with
houses
loaded
and
priests
and
people
but
ah
they
were
not
woaded
not
all
the
walls
could
shed
the
spell
of
meres
and
marshes
green
nor
any
chaffering
merchant
tell
the
beauty
that
had
been
the
crying
birds
at
fall
of
night
the
fisher
in
his
coracle
and
grim
on
ludgate
windy
height
an
and
an
oracle
sick
for
the
past
his
hair
he
rent
and
dropt
a
tear
in
season
if
he
had
cause
for
his
lament
we
have
much
better
reason
for
now
the
fields
and
paths
he
knew
are
coffined
all
with
bricks
the
lucid
silver
stream
he
knew
runs
slimy
as
the
styx
north
and
south
and
east
and
west
far
as
the
eye
can
travel
earth
with
a
sombre
web
is
drest
that
nothing
can
unravel
and
we
must
wear
as
black
a
frown
wail
with
as
keen
a
woe
that
london
was
a
little
town
five
hundred
years
ago
yet
even
this
place
of
steamy
stir
this
pit
of
belch
and
swallow
with
chrism
of
gold
and
gossamer
the
elements
can
hallow
i
have
a
room
in
chancery
lane
high
in
a
world
of
wires
whence
fall
the
roofs
a
ragged
plain
wooded
with
many
spires
there
in
the
dawns
of
summer
days
i
stand
in
adoration
while
london
robed
in
rainbow
haze
and
gold
illumination
the
wizard
breezes
waft
the
rays
shot
by
the
waking
sun
a
myriad
chimneys
softly
blaze
a
myriad
shadows
run
round
the
wide
rim
in
radiant
mist
the
gentle
suburbs
quiver
and
nearer
lies
the
shining
twist
of
thames
a
holy
river
left
and
right
my
vision
drifts
by
yonder
towers
i
linger
where
westminster
cathedral
lifts
its
belled
byzantine
finger
and
here
against
my
perchèd
home
where
hold
wise
converse
daily
the
loftier
and
the
lesser
dome
paul
and
the
old
bailey
echoes
there
is
a
far
unfading
city
where
bright
immortal
people
are
remote
from
hollow
shame
and
pity
their
portals
frame
no
guiding
star
but
blightless
pleasure
moteless
rays
that
follow
their
footsteps
as
they
dance
long
lutanied
measures
through
a
maze
of
song
and
dalliance
there
always
glows
the
vernal
sun
there
happy
birds
for
ever
sing
there
faint
perfumèd
breezes
run
through
branches
of
eternal
spring
there
faces
browned
and
fruit
and
milk
and
words
and
kisses
in
galleys
gowned
with
gold
and
silk
shake
on
a
lake
of
dainty
blisses
coyness
is
not
nor
bear
they
thought
save
of
a
shining
gracious
flow
all
natural
joys
are
temperate
sought
for
calm
desire
there
they
know
a
fire
promiscuous
languorous
kind
they
scorn
all
fiercer
lusts
and
quarrels
nor
blow
about
on
anger
wind
nor
burn
with
love
nor
rust
with
morals
folk
in
the
far
unfading
city
burning
with
lusts
my
senses
are
i
am
torn
with
love
and
shame
and
pity
be
to
my
heart
a
guiding
star
wise
youths
and
maidens
in
the
sun
with
eyes
that
charm
and
lips
that
sing
and
gentle
arms
that
rippling
run
shed
on
my
heart
your
endless
spring
the
fugitive
flying
his
hair
and
his
eyes
averse
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
how
could
we
clear
his
charms
rehearse
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
high
on
a
down
we
found
him
last
shy
as
a
hare
he
fled
as
fast
how
could
we
clasp
him
or
ever
he
passed
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
how
could
we
cling
to
his
limbs
that
shone
ravish
his
cheeks
red
gonfalon
or
the
cloak
that
he
had
on
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
for
the
wind
of
his
feet
still
straightly
shaping
he
loosed
at
our
breasts
from
his
eyes
escaping
one
crooked
swift
glance
like
a
javelin
leaping
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
and
his
feet
passed
over
the
sunset
land
from
the
place
forlorn
where
a
forlorn
band
watching
him
flying
we
still
did
stand
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
vanishing
now
who
would
not
stay
to
the
blue
hills
on
the
verge
of
day
o
soft
soft
music
play
fading
away
fleet
are
his
feet
and
his
heart
apart
fading
away
in
an
orchard
airy
and
quick
and
wise
in
the
shed
light
of
the
sun
you
clasp
with
friendly
eyes
the
thoughts
from
mine
that
run
but
something
breaks
the
link
i
solitary
stand
by
a
giant
gully
brink
in
some
vast
gloomy
land
sole
central
watcher
i
with
steadfast
sadness
now
in
that
waste
place
descry
the
awful
heavens
how
your
life
doth
dizzy
drop
a
little
foam
of
flame
from
a
peak
without
a
top
to
a
pit
without
a
name
in
a
chair
he
room
is
full
of
the
peace
of
night
the
small
flames
murmur
and
flicker
and
sway
within
me
is
neither
shadow
nor
light
nor
night
nor
twilight
nor
dawn
nor
day
for
the
brain
strives
not
to
the
goal
of
thought
and
the
limbs
lie
wearied
and
all
desire
sleeps
for
a
while
and
i
am
naught
but
a
pair
of
eyes
that
gaze
at
a
fire
a
day
i
morning
the
village
fades
away
where
i
last
night
came
where
they
housed
me
and
fed
me
and
never
asked
my
name
the
sun
shines
bright
my
step
is
light
i
who
have
no
abode
jeer
at
the
stuck
monotonous
black
posts
along
the
road
ii
midday
the
wood
is
still
as
here
i
sit
my
heart
drinks
in
the
peace
of
it
a
something
stirs
i
know
not
where
some
quiet
spirit
in
the
air
o
tall
straight
stems
o
cool
deep
green
o
hand
unfelt
o
face
unseen
iii
evening
the
evening
closes
in
as
down
this
last
long
lane
i
plod
there
patter
round
first
heavy
drops
of
rain
feet
ache
legs
ache
but
now
step
quickens
as
i
think
of
mounds
of
bread
and
cheese
and
something
hot
to
drink
iv
night
ah
sleep
is
sweet
but
yet
i
will
not
sleep
awhile
nor
for
a
space
forget
the
toil
of
that
last
mile
but
lie
awake
and
feel
the
cool
sheets
tremulous
kisses
all
my
body
steal
is
sleep
as
sweet
as
this
is
the
mind
of
man
i
beneath
my
and
my
hair
covered
like
a
poisonous
well
there
is
a
land
if
you
looked
there
what
you
saw
you
quail
to
tell
you
that
sit
there
smiling
you
know
that
what
i
say
is
true
my
head
is
very
small
to
touch
i
feel
it
all
from
front
to
back
an
eared
round
that
weighs
not
much
eyes
and
a
pulpy
crack
oh
how
small
how
small
it
is
how
could
countries
be
in
this
yet
when
i
watch
with
eyelids
shut
it
glimmers
forth
now
dark
now
clear
the
city
of
the
marshes
and
the
writhing
mere
the
land
that
every
man
i
see
knows
in
himself
but
not
in
me
ii
upon
the
borders
of
the
weald
i
walk
there
first
when
i
step
in
set
in
green
wood
and
smiling
field
the
city
stands
unstained
of
sin
white
thoughts
and
wishes
pure
walk
the
streets
with
steps
demure
in
its
clean
groves
and
spacious
halls
the
inhabitants
hold
innocent
sunny
festivals
and
mingle
in
decorous
dance
things
that
destroy
distort
deface
come
never
to
that
lovely
place
never
could
evil
enter
thither
it
could
not
live
in
that
sweet
air
the
shadow
of
an
ill
deed
must
wither
and
fall
away
to
nothing
there
you
would
say
as
there
you
stand
that
all
was
beauty
in
the
land
but
go
you
out
beyond
the
gateway
cleave
you
the
woods
and
pass
the
plain
cross
you
the
frontier
down
and
straightway
the
trees
will
end
the
grass
will
wane
and
you
will
come
to
a
wilderness
of
sticks
and
parchèd
barrenness
the
middle
of
the
land
is
this
a
tawny
desert
midmost
set
barren
of
living
things
it
is
saving
at
night
some
vampires
flit
that
nest
them
in
the
farther
marish
where
all
save
vilest
things
must
perish
here
in
this
reedy
marsh
of
green
and
oily
pools
swarm
insects
fat
and
birds
of
prey
and
beasts
obscene
things
that
the
traveller
shudders
at
all
cunning
things
that
creep
and
fly
to
suck
men
blood
until
they
die
rarely
from
hence
does
aught
escape
into
the
world
of
outer
light
but
now
and
then
some
sable
shape
outward
will
dash
in
sudden
flight
and
men
stand
stonied
or
distraught
to
know
the
loathly
deed
or
thought
but
ah
beyond
the
marsh
you
reach
a
purulent
place
more
vile
than
all
a
festering
lake
too
foul
for
speech
rotten
and
black
with
coils
acrawl
where
writhe
with
lecherous
squeakings
shrill
horrors
that
make
the
heart
stand
still
there
a
heaven
diseased
it
lies
the
mere
alive
with
slimy
worms
with
perverse
terrible
infamies
and
murders
and
repulsive
forms
that
have
no
name
but
slide
here
deep
whilst
i
their
holder
silence
keep
a
reasonable
protestation
to
who
complained
of
his
vagueness
and
lack
of
dogmatic
statement
not
i
suppose
since
i
deny
appearance
is
reality
and
doubt
the
substance
of
the
earth
does
your
remonstrance
come
to
birth
not
that
at
once
i
both
affirm
is
not
the
skin
that
makes
the
worm
and
every
tactile
thing
with
mass
must
find
its
symbol
in
the
grass
and
with
a
cool
conviction
say
even
a
critic
more
than
clay
and
every
dog
outlives
his
day
this
kind
of
vagueness
suits
your
view
you
would
not
carp
at
it
for
you
did
never
stand
with
those
who
take
their
pleasures
in
a
world
opaque
for
you
a
tree
would
never
be
lovely
were
it
but
a
tree
and
earthly
splendours
never
splendid
if
by
transience
unattended
your
eyes
are
on
a
farther
shore
than
any
of
earth
you
not
adore
as
godhead
god
dead
hieroglyph
nor
would
you
be
perturbed
if
some
prophet
with
a
voice
of
thunder
and
avalanche
arm
should
blast
and
founder
the
logical
pillars
that
maintain
this
visible
world
which
loads
the
brain
loads
the
brain
and
withers
the
heart
and
holds
man
from
his
god
apart
but
still
with
you
remains
the
craving
for
some
more
solid
substance
having
surface
to
touch
colour
to
see
and
form
compact
in
symmetry
you
are
not
satisfied
with
these
vague
throbbings
utterless
ecstasies
void
finds
your
spirit
of
delight
this
great
indefinite
white
light
not
with
such
sickles
can
you
reap
if
a
dense
earth
you
can
not
keep
you
want
a
dense
heaven
as
substitute
with
trees
of
plump
celestial
fruit
red
apples
golden
pomegranates
and
a
river
flowing
by
tall
gates
of
topaz
and
of
chrysolite
and
walls
of
twenty
cubits
height
frank
you
cry
out
against
the
age
nor
you
nor
i
can
disengage
ourselves
from
that
in
which
we
live
nor
seize
on
things
god
does
not
give
thirsty
as
you
perhaps
i
long
for
courtyards
of
eternal
song
even
as
yours
my
feet
would
stray
in
a
city
where
is
always
day
and
a
green
spontaneous
leafy
garden
with
god
in
the
middle
for
a
warden
but
though
i
trust
with
strengthening
faith
i
taste
when
i
have
traversed
death
the
unimaginable
sweetness
of
certitude
of
such
concreteness
how
should
i
draw
the
hue
and
scope
of
substances
i
only
hope
or
blaze
upon
a
mortal
screen
the
evidence
of
things
not
seen
this
art
of
ours
but
grows
and
stirs
experience
when
it
registers
and
you
know
well
as
i
know
well
this
autumn
of
time
in
which
we
dwell
is
not
an
age
of
revelations
solid
as
once
but
intimations
that
touch
us
with
warm
misty
fingers
leaving
a
nameless
sense
that
lingers
that
sight
is
blind
and
time
a
snare
and
earth
less
solid
than
the
air
and
deep
below
all
seeming
things
there
sits
a
steady
king
of
kings
a
radiant
ageless
permanence
a
quenchless
fount
of
virtue
whence
we
draw
our
life
a
sense
that
makes
a
staunch
conviction
nothing
shakes
of
our
own
immortality
and
though
being
man
with
certain
glee
i
eat
and
drink
though
i
suffer
pain
and
love
and
hate
and
love
again
well
or
in
mode
contemptible
thus
shackled
by
the
body
spell
i
see
through
pupils
of
the
beast
though
it
be
faint
and
blurred
with
mist
a
star
that
travels
in
the
east
i
see
what
i
can
not
what
i
will
in
things
that
move
things
that
are
still
thin
motion
even
cloudier
rest
i
see
the
symbols
god
hath
drest
the
moveless
trees
the
trees
that
wave
the
clouds
that
heavenly
highways
have
horses
that
run
rocks
that
are
fixt
streams
that
have
rest
and
motion
mixt
the
main
with
its
abiding
flux
the
wind
that
up
my
chimney
sucks
a
mounting
waterfall
of
flame
sticks
straws
dust
beetles
and
that
same
old
blazing
sun
the
psalmist
saw
a
testifier
to
the
law
divinely
to
the
heart
they
speak
saying
how
they
are
but
weak
wan
will
o
the
wisps
the
crystal
sea
but
stays
that
sea
still
dark
to
me
did
i
now
glibly
insolent
chart
the
ulterior
firmament
would
you
not
know
my
words
were
lies
where
not
my
testimonial
eyes
mortal
or
spiritual
lodge
mere
uncorroborated
fudge
praise
me
though
praise
i
do
not
want
rather
that
i
have
cast
much
cant
that
what
i
see
and
feel
i
write
read
what
i
can
in
this
dim
light
granted
to
me
in
nether
night
and

twelve
translations
from
charles
baudelaire
tout
entière
this
morning
in
my
attic
high
the
demon
came
to
visit
me
and
seeking
faults
in
my
reply
he
said
i
would
inquire
of
thee
of
all
the
beauties
which
compose
her
charming
body
potent
spell
of
all
the
objects
black
and
rose
which
make
the
thing
you
love
so
well
which
is
the
sweetest
o
my
soul
thou
didst
rejoin
how
tell
of
parts
when
all
i
know
is
that
the
whole
works
magic
in
my
heart
of
hearts
where
all
is
fair
how
should
i
say
what
single
grace
is
my
delight
she
shines
on
me
like
break
of
day
and
she
consoles
me
as
the
night
there
flows
through
all
her
perfect
frame
a
harmony
too
exquisite
that
weak
analysis
should
name
the
numberless
accords
of
it
o
mystic
metamorphosis
my
separate
senses
all
are
blent
within
her
breath
soft
music
is
and
in
her
voice
a
subtle
scent
the
alchemy
of
grief
one
nature
burns
and
makes
thee
bright
one
gives
thee
weeds
to
mourn
withal
and
what
to
one
is
burial
is
to
the
other
life
and
light
the
unknown
hermes
who
assists
and
alway
fills
my
heart
with
fear
makes
me
the
mighty
midas
peer
the
saddest
of
the
alchemists
through
him
i
make
gold
changeable
to
dross
and
paradise
to
hell
clouds
for
its
i
descry
a
stark
dead
body
i
love
well
and
in
the
gleaming
fields
on
high
i
build
immense
sarcophagi
spleen
when
the
low
heavy
sky
weighs
like
a
lid
upon
the
spirit
aching
for
the
light
and
all
the
wide
horizon
line
is
hid
by
a
black
day
sadder
than
any
night
when
the
changed
earth
is
but
a
dungeon
dank
where
batlike
hope
goes
blindly
fluttering
and
striking
wall
and
roof
and
mouldered
plank
bruises
his
tender
head
and
timid
wing
when
like
grim
stretch
down
the
thin
straight
rigid
pillars
of
the
endless
rain
and
the
dumb
throngs
of
infamous
spiders
spin
their
meshes
in
the
caverns
of
the
brain
suddenly
bells
leap
forth
into
the
air
hurling
a
hideous
uproar
to
the
sky
as
a
band
of
homeless
spirits
who
fare
through
the
strange
heavens
wailing
stubbornly
and
hearses
without
drum
or
instrument
file
slowly
through
my
soul
crushed
sorrowful
weeps
hope
and
grief
fierce
and
omnipotent
plants
his
black
banner
on
my
drooping
skull
a
voyage
to
cythera
my
heart
was
like
a
bird
and
took
to
flight
around
the
rigging
circling
joyously
the
ship
rolled
on
beneath
a
cloudless
sky
like
a
great
angel
drunken
with
the
light
what
is
yon
isle
sad
and
funereal
cythera
famed
in
deathless
song
said
they
the
gay
old
bachelors
look
is
a
poor
bare
country
after
all
isle
of
sweet
secrets
and
heart
banquetings
the
queenly
shade
of
antique
venus
thrills
scentlike
above
thy
level
seas
and
fills
our
souls
with
languor
and
all
amorous
things
fair
isle
and
of
green
myrtles
and
blown
flowers
held
holy
by
all
men
for
evermore
where
the
faint
sighs
of
spirits
that
adore
float
like
through
the
quiet
hours
and
dovelike
sounds
each
murmured
orison
cythera
lay
there
barren
bright
skies
a
rocky
waste
rent
by
discordant
cries
natheless
i
saw
a
curious
thing
thereon
no
shady
temple
was
it
close
enshrined
i
the
trees
no
priestess
hither
came
with
her
young
body
burnt
by
secret
flame
baring
her
breast
to
the
caressing
wind
but
when
so
close
to
the
land
edge
we
drew
our
canvas
scared
the
gradually
we
knew
it
for
a
gallows
tree
like
a
black
cypress
stark
against
the
blue
a
rotten
carcase
hung
whereon
did
sit
a
swarm
of
foul
black
birds
with
writhe
and
shriek
each
sought
to
pierce
and
plunge
his
beak
deep
in
the
bleeding
trunk
and
limbs
of
it
the
eyes
were
holes
the
belly
opened
wide
streaming
its
heavy
entrails
on
the
thighs
the
grim
birds
gorged
with
dreadful
delicacies
had
dug
and
furrowed
it
on
every
side
beneath
the
blackened
feet
there
strove
and
pressed
a
herd
of
jealous
beasts
with
upward
snout
and
in
the
midst
of
these
there
turned
about
one
the
chief
hangman
larger
than
the
rest
lone
cytherean
now
all
silently
thou
sufferest
these
insults
to
atone
for
those
old
infamous
sins
that
thou
hast
known
the
sins
that
locked
the
gate
o
the
grave
to
thee
mine
are
thy
sorrows
ludicrous
corse
yea
all
are
mine
i
stood
thy
swaying
limbs
beneath
and
like
a
bitter
vomit
to
my
teeth
there
rose
old
shadows
in
a
stream
of
gall
o
thou
unhappy
devil
i
felt
afresh
gazing
at
thee
the
beaks
and
jaws
of
those
black
savage
panthers
and
those
ruthless
crows
who
loved
of
old
to
macerate
my
flesh
the
sea
was
calm
the
sky
without
a
cloud
henceforth
for
me
all
things
that
came
to
pass
were
blood
and
darkness
round
my
heart
alas
there
clung
that
allegory
like
a
shroud
naught
save
mine
image
on
a
gibbet
thrust
found
i
on
venus
island
desolate
ah
god
the
courage
and
strength
to
contemplate
my
body
and
my
heart
without
disgust
the
cracked
bell
is
when
winter
nights
are
long
to
watch
beside
the
flames
which
smoke
and
twist
the
distant
memories
which
slowly
throng
brought
by
the
chime
through
the
mist
happy
the
sturdy
bell
who
spite
of
age
alert
and
confident
cries
hourly
like
some
strong
old
sentinel
flinging
the
ready
challenge
from
his
tent
for
me
my
soul
is
cracked
when
sick
with
care
she
strives
with
songs
to
people
the
cold
air
it
happens
often
that
her
feeble
cries
mock
the
harsh
rattle
of
a
man
who
lies
wounded
forgotten
a
mound
of
slain
and
dies
pinned
fast
writhing
his
limbs
in
pain
the
offended
moon
o
moon
o
lamp
of
hill
and
secret
dale
thou
whom
our
fathers
ages
out
of
mind
worshipped
in
thy
blue
heaven
whilst
behind
thy
stars
streamed
after
thee
a
glittering
trail
dost
see
the
poet
and
pale
or
lovers
on
their
happy
beds
reclined
showing
white
teeth
in
sleep
or
vipers
twined
the
dry
sward
or
in
a
golden
veil
stealest
thou
with
faint
footfall
the
grass
as
of
old
to
kiss
from
twilight
unto
dawn
the
faded
charms
of
thine
endymion
o
child
of
this
sick
century
i
see
thy
mother
leering
in
her
glass
and
plastering
the
breast
that
suckled
thee
to
theodore
de
banville
so
proud
your
port
your
arm
so
powerful
with
such
a
grip
you
grip
the
goddess
hair
that
one
might
take
you
from
your
casual
air
for
a
young
ruffian
flinging
down
his
trull
your
clear
eye
flashing
with
precocity
you
have
displayed
yourself
proud
architect
of
fabrics
so
audaciously
correct
that
we
may
guess
what
your
ripe
prime
will
be
poet
our
blood
ebbs
out
through
every
pore
is
it
perchance
the
robe
the
centaur
bore
which
made
a
sullen
streamlet
of
each
vein
was
three
times
dipped
within
the
venom
fell
of
those
old
reptiles
fierce
and
terrible
whom
in
his
cradle
hercules
had
slain

oft

as
it
were

moving
mighty
sea

me
towards
my
pale
star
in
clear
space
or
a
vaporous
canopy
i
set
sail
with
heaving
chest
which
strains
forward
and
lungs
outblown
i
climb
the
ridgèd
steeps
of
those
clouds
which
the
night
are
thrown
veiling
its
starry
deeps
i
suffer
all
the
throes
within
my
quivering
form
of
a
great
ship
in
pain
now
a
soft
wind
and
now
the
writhings
of
a
storm
upon
the
vasty
main
rock
me
at
other
times
a
calm
the
bare
mirror
of
my
despair
the
cats
the
lover
and
the
stern
philosopher
both
love
in
their
ripe
time
the
confident
soft
cats
the
house
chiefest
ornament
who
like
themselves
are
cold
and
seldom
stir
of
knowledge
and
of
pleasure
amorous
silence
they
seek
and
darkness
fell
domain
had
not
their
proud
souls
scorned
to
brook
his
rein
they
would
have
made
grim
steeds
for
erebus
pensive
they
rest
in
noble
attitudes
like
great
stretched
sphinxes
in
vast
solitudes
which
seem
to
sleep
wrapt
in
an
endless
dream
their
fruitful
loins
are
full
of
sparks
divine
and
gleams
of
gold
within
their
pupils
shine
as
within
the
shadow
of
a
stream
the
sadness
of
the
moon
this
evening
the
moon
dreams
more
languidly
like
a
beauty
who
on
mounded
cushions
rests
and
with
her
light
hand
fondles
lingeringly
before
she
sleeps
the
slope
of
her
sweet
breasts
on
her
soft
satined
avalanches
height
dying
she
laps
herself
for
hours
and
hours
in
long
long
swoons
and
gazes
at
the
white
visions
which
rise
athwart
the
blue
like
flowers
when
sometimes
in
her
perfect
indolence
she
lets
a
furtive
tear
steal
gently
thence
some
pious
poet
a
lone
sleepless
one
takes
in
his
hollowed
hand
this
gem
shot
through
like
an
opal
stone
with
gleams
of
every
hue
and
in
his
heart
depths
hides
it
from
the

of

songs
the
kisses
and
the

the
laughing
draughts
of

in
hidden

the

through

the
green

of
childish
loves
the
artless
paradise
of
stealthy
joys
is
that
already
leagues
beyond

can
one
with
a
little
plaintive
noise
bring
it
again
that
is
so
far
away
the
artless
paradise
of
stealthy
joys
the
owls
their
black
yews
in
solemn
state
the
owls
are
sitting
in
a
row
like
foreign
gods
and
even
so
blink
their
red
eyes
they
meditate
quite
motionless
they
hold
them
thus
until
at
last
the
day
is
done
and
driving
down
the
slanting
sun
the
sad
night
is
victorious
they
teach
the
wise
who
gives
them
ear
that
in
this
world
he
most
should
fear
all
things
which
loud
or
restless

dazzled
by
a
passing
shade
follows
it
never

the
dread
