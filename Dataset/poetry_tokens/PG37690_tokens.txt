to
his
little
daughter
jane
five

of
them
he
makes
he
had
not
kept
these
pretty
babes
a
twelvemonth
and
a
day
but
for
their
wealth
he
did
devise
to
make
them
both
away
he
bargained
with
two
ruffians
strong
which
were
of
furious
mood
that
they
should
take
these
children
young
and
slay
them
in
a
wood
he
told
his
wife
an
artful
tale
he
would
the
children
send
to
be
brought
up
in
fair
london
with
one
that
was
his
friend
away
then
went
those
pretty
babes
rejoicing
at
that
tide
rejoicing
with
a
merry
mind
they
should
on
ride
they
prate
and
prattle
pleasantly
as
they
rode
on
the
way
to
those
that
should
their
butchers
be
and
work
their
lives
decay
so
that
the
pretty
speech
they
had
made
murder
heart
relent
and
they
that
undertook
the
deed
full
sore
did
now
repent
yet
one
of
them
more
hard
of
heart
did
vow
to
do
his
charge
because
the
wretch
that
hired
him
had
paid
him
very
large
the
other
wo
agree
thereto
so
here
they
fall
to
strife
with
one
another
they
did
fight
about
the
children
life
and
he
that
was
of
mildest
mood
did
slay
the
other
there
within
an
unfrequented
wood
the
babes
did
quake
for
fear
he
took
the
children
by
the
hand
tears
standing
in
their
eye
and
bade
them
straightway
follow
him
and
look
they
did
not
cry
