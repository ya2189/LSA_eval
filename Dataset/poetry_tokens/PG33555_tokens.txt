where
union
dwelt
beside
the
deep
ravine
the
cottage
stood
elm
and
willow
beech
and
birch
in
growth
profuse
and
wild
shady
stream
and
viewing
cedar
oak
and
towering
pine
on
yonder
crest
aglow
with
light
how
grand
the
vision
in
the
greenness
of
the
spring
when
birds
of
blue
and
scarlet
vestments
come
the
greater
glory
of
the
summer
time
when
twinkling
wings
outvie
the
rarest
flowers
or
ripeness
of
the
fall
when
richest
green
and
gold
and
red
in
mass
of
tapestry
delight
the
eye
but
now
the
scene
is
white
resplendent
white
no
miser
hand
hath
swept
the
vale
and
heights
but
nature
bountiful
of
beauty
dazzling
pure
the
season
own
the
spotless
path
below
meandering
midst
boughs
and
drooping
plants
enwrapped
in
feathered
snow
a
reverend
scene
appears
as
if
for
angels
formed
who
came
to
walk
this
sacred
aisle
to
worship
winter
god
the
lofty
pines
that
grace
the
other
crest
enrobed
in
sparkling
splendor
raise
their
heads
in
solemn
awe
to
yonder
jewelled
dome
and
offer
praise
to
him
whose
temple
bright
holds
earth
and
sky
beneath
a
frosted
birch
lit
up
to
brilliance
by
the
burnished
moon
the
shingle
cottage
stood
a
humble
home
the
labour
of
the
day
was
done
the
lamp
within
sent
out
its
yellow
rays
athwart
the
silver
snow
and
on
the
sheets
and
other
things
that
hung
on
lines
and
told
the
woman
calling
work
from
dawn
of
day
till
dark
with
poor
reward
christmas
eve
was
christmas
eve
the
mother
and
her
little
boy
his
name
was
david
annandale
sat
down
to
read
and
converse
hold
before
they
sought
repose
a
widow
young
with
richest
auburn
hair
bright
hazel
eyes
finely
arching
brows
teeth
of
pearl
and
sympathetic
smile
most
sweet
no
wonder
that
her
child
a
lad
of
six
with
raven
hair
and
ruddy
cheeks
should
find
in
her
alone
his
heart
desire
his
reigning
thought
the
perfect
one
his
eyes
lovelit
no
blemish
saw
in
careworn
looks
her
stories
read
and
told
with
girlish
zeal
of
beaver
bear
and
wolf
and
jet
black
squirrel
but
best
of
all
of
smiling
santa
claus
aroused
an
interest
intense
the
deep
ravine
itself
and
other
themes
all
passed
beneath
her
spell
and
he
tho
entertained
was
also
purified
and
lifted
up
my
mother
dear
he
said
when
i
a
man
i
work
and
work
for
you
and
buy
a
castle
and
a
carriage
you
will
be
a
lady
and
nevermore
be
tired
tired
himself
at
last
his
eyelids
fell
he
dreamed
a
moment
deep
then
wide
awoke
and
starting
up
he
wept
and
as
he
sobbed
he
said
i
seen
my
kitten
in
the
cold
ravine
oh
let
it
in
this
was
a
kitten
lost
a
while
before
a
creature
in
his
heart
as
much
as
treasure
real
or
ideal
fills
the
heart
of
any
ardent
man
he
ever
longed
and
hoped
for
its
return
and
every
night
the
door
was
opened
and
the
yearning
call
went
out
into
the
empty
air
and
every
night
he
saw
the
lost
one
dish
supplied
which
morning
found
untouched
the
mother
did
her
best
to
stay
his
tears
and
as
she
bent
and
tucked
him
warm
in
bed
she
said
that
maybe
santa
claus
would
bring
another
kitten
tie
a
great
big
stocking
mother
make
it
open
wide
and
warm
she
did
so
kissed
him
and
he
closed
his
eyes
one
hand
alone
would
fill
that
empty
stocking
nor
forget
a
friend
or
neighbor
would
come
later
on
but
david
eyes
when
morning
came
would
look
on
emptiness
save
for
mother
hand
nay
stay
at
midnight
yea
at
midnight
when
the
moon
was
still
a
silver
lamp
a
creature
poor
benighted
wandered
to
the
cottage
door
cold
too
sick
to
cry
it
looked
with
wistful
eyes
beneath
the
fastened
door
then
turned
and
went
aside
and
trembling
climbed
the
sloping
birchen
tree
and
reached
the
roof
adown
the
chimney
peered
then
slowly
crept
then
fell
it
lay
upon
the
hearth
a
time
but
lured
it
lapped
the
milk
and
strengthened
strove
to
climb
into
the
little
sleeper
cot
it
strove
but
failed
and
guided
by
a
gentle
hand
it
fell
at
last
into
the
open
stocking
head
above
and
finding
comfort
softly
purred
and
slept
ah
sleeping
boy
thou
dreamest
not
the
joy
awaiting
thee
the
empty
place
within
thy
heart
shall
soon
be
filled
thy
grief
assuaged
thy
hot
tears
dried
is
little
value
but
is
much
to
thee
because
thy
love
is
wrapped
up
there
and
love
is
value
measure
in
the
heart
of
rich
and
poor
the
boy
awoke
and
rubbed
his
eyes
the
sun
had
risen
the
grand
ravine
a
silver
scene
and
sent
its
slanting
rays
of
gold
beneath
the
blind
across
the
cot
he
waited
not
but
crept
along
and
looked
below
two
eyes
looked
up
a
moment
mutual
magnetized
transfixed
he
drew
the
creature
from
its
woollen
bed
he
kissed
it
pressed
it
to
his
cheek
and
wept
for
joy
the
mother
woke
the
midnight
gift
was
seen
and
gladly
welcomed
home
while
david
slept
and
now
she
also
wept
for
joy
no
home
was
happier
on
that
christmas
morn
no
gift
was
costlier
than
the
gift
that
meant
the
wasted
worthless
waif
return
illustration
magnetized
the
lurking
foe
till
early
spring
too
soon
while
david
went
to
school
and
learned
well
the
widow
bravely
labored
on
frost
and
snow
and
storm
thro
strain
of
overwork
and
worse
inhaled
mayhap
from
matter
bad
in
her
calling
who
can
trace
the
lurking
venom
foe
the
wasting
plague
had
found
a
cruel
lodgment
in
her
breast
one
hope
remains
the
kind
physician
said
who
made
no
charge
for
visits
not
a
few
is
institutional
treatment
where
the
air
is
light
and
pure
where
food
is
plentiful
and
rest
abounds
the
parting
wrench
was
sore
the
mother
hid
her
grief
and
tears
and
smiled
but
david
wept
without
restraint
a
farming
couple
sympathetic
offered
refuge
for
awhile
and
when
he
went
away
his
kitten
in
a
basket
his
arm
his
heart
was
heavy
for
the
sun
was
down
the
world
was
dark
but
five
months
treatment
free
was
great
and
good
and
david
mother
seemed
to
be
restored
to
health
for
strength
was
there
and
color
beautiful
was
not
enough
tho
all
that
could
be
given
that
other
waiting
sufferers
might
have
a
chance
to
live
with
rest
at
home
the
healing
work
begun
would
one
day
be
complete
ye
men
of
wealth
and
all
that
generous
give
with
all
that
halt
herein
your
golden
opportunity
doth
lie
a
home
you
have
prepared
for
them
that
leave
the
prison
cell
and
this
is
well
but
what
awaits
the
convalescent
widow
and
the
orphan
fighting
off
the
wasting
plague
suspicion
dread
a
refuge
craved
for
vainly
here
and
there
a
battle
hopeless
lost
awake
awake
oh
give
the
shelter
sure
a
child
would
give
to
any
famished
waif
oh
wake
compassion
wake
when
david
big
with
joy
returned
the
wind
sang
in
the
trees
the
flowers
red
and
white
a
welcome
smiled
the
cottage
seemed
to
be
a
prince
home
and
mother
in
her
loveliness
a
queen
while
in
the
mother
eyes
her
child
appeared
as
if
a
shepherd
lad
he
looked
so
strong
so
lithe
and
ruddy
but
the
only
flock
that
david
had
consisted
of
a
kitten
now
a
cat
renowned
of
and
fat
and
once
again
the
gave
foretaste
of
the
other
deathless
pure
and
glad
for
love
was
there
with
quenchless
hope
the
happy
widow
bravely
bent
her
shoulders
to
the
yoke
again
she
had
her
boy
to
live
for
work
for
love
and
he
would
be
a
man
some
day
and
strong
when
she
would
lean
on
him
as
he
had
leaned
on
her
and
yet
the
yoke
was
heavy
and
grew
heavier
as
vigour
waned
in
spite
of
hope
and
will
she
craved
for
rest
or
even
if
the
wage
were
better
labour
could
be
lessened
and
give
more
of
rest
on
strike
one
day
some
workmen
struck
for
better
pay
and
david
wondered
what
it
meant
to
strike
what
is
it
mother
do
they
hit
the
men
that
give
them
work
the
mother
smiled
no
no
my
child
they
merely
rest
or
cease
from
work
to
force
their
masters
into
giving
better
pay
to
get
them
back
to
work
a
happy
thought
now
seized
him
oh
mother
strike
and
then
the
people
sure
will
give
you
better
pay
the
mother
smiled
but
sighed
and
said
my
darling
boy
if
i
should
strike
a
score
of
women
poor
are
ready
even
glad
to
take
my
place
perchance
for
less
the
boy
was
disappointed
and
his
heart
was
sad
but
strike
that
odd
word
strike
as
meaning
rest
from
work
or
stopping
work
clung
fast
to
david
mind
apart
from
better
pay
he
thought
that
something
good
remained
and
so
at
night
the
last
thing
done
before
he
slept
the
boy
would
often
take
his
board
a
blackboard
big
and
chalk
in
letters
large
and
white
on
strike
till
on
strike
till
on
strike
till
according
as
his
mother
work
required
or
strength
could
stand
the
metal
clock
a
loud
alarum
was
also
wound
and
set
at
this
the
mother
always
smiled
but
when
her
treasure
eyes
were
closed
in
sleep
she
wept
she
dared
not
bend
and
kiss
those
cherub
lips
his
lovely
face
grew
paler
day
by
day
and
dread
an
awful
dread
laid
hold
of
her
and
she
herself
was
wasting
swift
and
sure
the
candle
flame
was
burning
low
another
christmas
two
nights
not
more
before
the
christmas
eve
a
heap
of
things
for
washing
lay
against
the
wall
alas
at
any
time
too
great
the
present
task
might
break
the
weary
back
but
christmas
need
was
pressing
and
the
labour
must
be
done
oh
spare
that
wasted
frame
hear
o
lord
the
widow
cry
the
weary
yet
the
watchful
boy
his
blackboard
took
and
wrote
in
letters
big
and
urgent
seeming
charged
with
meaning
strange
and
the
clock
alarum
was
set
and
now
on
bended
knee
beside
his
mother
knee
he
spoke
his
simple
prayer
pleading
lastly
that
his
mother
might
have
better
wages
and
have
rest
and
oh
the
mother
heart
went
with
him
with
himself
before
the
throne
forgetful
ay
entirely
of
herself
a
wild
temptation
seized
her
she
would
clasp
yea
fiercely
hug
that
wasted
to
her
breast
and
kiss
those
guileless
beauteous
sweetest
lips
alas
she
knew
the
worst
had
come
those
eyes
uplifted
hollow
shining
spoke
of
death
and
why
refrain
she
would
not
yea
she
drank
the
cup
of
pleasure
to
the
full
the
child
was
glad
and
went
to
rest
a
smile
of
heaven
on
his
lips
and
now
the
mother
satisfied
as
one
with
strongest
wine
rose
up
and
ope
the
door
she
looked
abroad
a
moment
then
went
out
into
the
silent
air
the
deep
ravine
was
glorious
white
the
mighty
pines
were
robed
as
if
prepared
to
sing
in
heaven
choir
on
earth
when
strong
the
northern
tempest
blew
the
widow
vigour
getting
for
a
little
from
the
frosty
air
admired
the
scene
and
lifting
up
her
eyes
to
sparkling
worlds
above
she
felt
assured
though
human
help
and
pity
wholly
failed
that
somewhere
sometime
there
was
plenteous
rest
and
yet
she
thanked
and
praised
the
power
that
good
and
evil
gave
for
one
brief
cup
of
pleasure
if
no
more
her
pleasure
in
her
darling
boy
take
him
o
lord
whatever
portion
mine
the
tension
loosed
the
stricken
widow
turned
yet
ere
she
turned
she
scanned
the
northern
shore
of
brilliant
night
and
lo
a
mountain
mass
of
tempest
clouds
lined
up
for
battle
with
the
sleeping
south
the
woman
fearless
smiled
as
if
in
kinship
with
the
coming
storm
but
having
struggled
spoken
pleaded
strong
her
transient
vigour
gone
she
stumbled
to
the
door
and
entered
in
beside
the
bed
she
saw
the
letters
written
on
the
board
as
if
the
sacred
writing
on
the
wall
she
saw
the
slender
lovely
hand
exposed
that
wrote
them
and
she
bowed
and
kissed
it
but
she
could
not
weep
ere
midnight
came
the
child
awoke
disturbed
and
anxious
said
oh
mother
dear
what
is
that
awful
sound
my
darling
is
the
sighing
of
the
wind
among
the
pines
but
swifter
sped
the
tempest
swifter
and
the
pines
they
bowed
their
heads
before
the
blast
and
sang
the
cedars
high
and
oaks
together
answered
back
in
song
and
louder
louder
as
if
thunder
grand
the
tempest
bell
of
music
rang
the
boy
awoke
again
and
feebly
cried
oh
mother
i
afraid
what
is
that
dreadful
sound
my
darling
fear
not
is
the
voice
of
god
he
leads
the
choir
and
he
remembers
you
and
me
oh
mother
take
me
in
beside
you
i
afraid
of
god
but
jesus
here
he
stopped
he
struggled
till
he
got
in
part
athwart
the
cot
and
as
his
wearied
head
sank
down
he
whispered
faintly
and
there
came
a
broken
answer
whispering
near
me
nearer
darling
that
was
all
the
storm
the
mother
music
but
the
child
affright
attained
its
height
then
sudden
rang
the
loud
alarum
but
they
heard
it
not
there
was
once
a
manger
once
a
cross
and
both
by
man
despised
but
god
hath
both
exalted
high
and
once
a
lonely
cottage
lowly
overlooked
by
men
but
god
on
it
had
mercy
tho
he
seemed
to
be
in
wrath
illustration
the
morning
saw
her
come
three
wise
men
did
not
come
nor
one
a
child
a
girl
with
golden
hair
and
laughing
eyes
a
furtive
playmate
of
the
boy
with
stress
walked
through
the
spotless
wreaths
of
snow
the
morning
saw
her
come
when
all
was
still
no
lock
debarred
her
and
she
entered
having
knocked
she
saw
the
writing
on
the
blackboard
big
against
the
wall
in
trembling
chalk
on
strike
till
and
duly
signed
by
david
annandale
she
saw
the
mother
face
upturned
to
heaven
she
saw
the
raven
locks
of
david
strewn
upon
her
breast
and
saw
his
face
was
also
white
as
snow
the
tragic
scene
was
quickly
seen
she
stood
amazed
a
moment
then
approached
uncertain
all
atremble
and
she
softly
pressed
her
playmate
brow
the
chill
of
death
went
thro
her
and
she
gave
a
piercing
cry
and
fled
of
christmas
day
next
day
but
one
the
pretty
child
had
come
to
speak
and
childlike
tell
of
something
fine
she
was
to
bring
but
that
great
day
of
countless
happy
homes
would
see
the
cottage
empty
nature
nature
god
in
mercy
stayed
the
stricken
widow
weary
labour
she
had
gone
on
strike
as
david
said
and
she
had
taken
her
darling
with
her
