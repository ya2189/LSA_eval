introduction
there
are
three
early
humorous
tracts
in
verse
upon
the
subject
of
marriage
all
printed
by
wynkyn
de
worde
only
one
of
them
has
a
date
but
we
can
have
little
difficulty
in
assigning
the
two
others
to
about
the
same
period
they
have
the
following
titles
complaynt
of
them
that
be
to
soone
begynneth
the
complaynte
of
them
that
ben
to
late
payne
and
sorowe
of
evyll
the
last
we
have
printed
entire
in
the
following
pages
and
of
the
two
others
dibdin
has
inserted
a
brief
account
in
his
edition
of
ames
typ
ant
ii
we
propose
to
go
more
at
large
into
a
description
of
the
contents
of
these
ancient
and
facetious
relics
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
two
first
are
translations
and
in
default
of
english
expressions
especially
in
the
second
piece
the
writer
has
employed
and
sometimes
anglicised
several
of
the
french
words
which
he
thought
better
adapted
to
his
purpose
to
this
production
auctour
as
he
calls
himself
has
subjoined
a
sort
of
epilogue
which
ingeniously
includes
the
colophon
as
follows
endeth
the
complaynt
of
to
late
maryed
for
spendynge
of
tyme
or
they
a
borde
the
sayd
holy
sacramente

to
longe
taryed
humane
nature
tassemble
and
it
to
accorde
enprynted
in
fletestrete
by
wynkyn
de
worde
dwellynge
in
the
famous
cyte
of
london
his
hous
in
the
same
at
the
sygne
of
the
at
the
conclusion
of
the
of
them
that
be
to
soone
maryed
the
date
of
has
also
been
interwoven
wynkyn
de
will
was
proved
the
january
which
according
to
our
present
mode
of
computing
the
year
would
be
the
january
so
that
either
this
piece
came
out
after
his
death
or
it
was
printed
just
before
that
event
and
in
anticipation
of
the
new
year
which
would
not
then
commence
until
the
march
each
of
the
tracts
has
a
on
the
titlepage
but
only
that
called
payne
and
sorowe
of
evyll
maryage
can
be
said
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
subject
and
that
no
doubt
had
been
used
for
other
works
it
represents
a
marriage
ceremony
priest
joining
the
hands
of
a
couple
before
the
altar
the
of
them
that
be
to
soone
opens
with
the
following
stanza
as
moche
as
many
folke
there
be
that
desyre

sacrament
of

put
now
in
wrytynge
in
what
sorowe
these
men
lede
theyr
lyves
that
to
soone
be
coupled
to
cursed
thence
the
author
proceeds
to
give
some
very
sage
and
serious
advice
upon
the
evil
of
too
hasty
matrimonial
alliances
but
he
does
not
attempt
much
humour
until
he
comes
to
describe
the
conduct
of
his
wife
for
he
writes
in
the
first
person
throughout
when
they
had
been
married
eight
days
until
then
he
had
not
been
ne
banged
but
he
suffered
for
it
bitterly
afterwards
soone
ynoughe
i
had
assayes
of
sorowe
and
care
that
made
me
it
may
here
be
observed
that
the
stanza
is
peculiar
and
consists
of
eight
lines
the
four
first
lines
rhyming
alternately
the
fifth
rhyming
with
the
fourth
then
a
line
with
a
new
rhyme
while
the
seventh
line
rhymes
with
the
third
and
fourth
and
the
eighth
with
the
sixth
he
continues
the
narrative
of
his
sufferings
in
the
following
manner
eyght
dayes
or
soone
after
our
maryage
the
tyme
for
to
passe
my

that
we
two
togyther
weere
by
god
ye
speke
to
soone
of
the
second
piece
of
ancient
complaynte
of
them
that
ben
to
late
maryed
is
written
with
much
more
humour
and
is
far
better
worth
preservation
but
it
is
disfigured
by
indelicacy
though
not
of
the
grossest
kind
and
never
introduced
but
for
the
sake
of
heightening
the
drollery
it
is
the
lamentation
of
an
elderly
gentleman
who
after
a
youth
of
riot
had
married
a
young
frolicksome
wife
and
he
relates
very
feelingly
the
inconveniences
annoyances
and
jealousies
to
which
he
is
thereby
exposed
after
two
introductory
stanzas
all
of
them
are
in
the
ordinary
ballad
form
he
thus
states
his
resolution
late
in
life
to
commit
the
folly
of
matrimony
longe
have
i
lyved
without
ony
make
all
to
longe
have
i
used
my
yonge
age
i
wyll
all
for
go
and
a
wyfe
to
me
take
for
to
increase
both
our
twoos
lynage
for
saynt
john
sayth
that
he
is
sage
that
ayenst
his
wyll
doth
him
governe
and
our
lordes
precepte
hym
selfe
for
to
learne
is
no
greter
pleasure
than
for
to
have
a
wyfe
that
is
full
of
prudence
and
wysdome
alas
for
love
nygh
i
am
in
poynte
to
rave
these
cursed
olde
men
have
an
yll
custome
women
for
to
blame
both
all
and
some
for
that
they
can
not
theyr
myndes
full
fyll
therfore
they
speke
of
them
but
all
yll
syth
that
i
have
my
tyme
used
for
to
follow
my
folyshe
pleasaunces
and
have
my
selfe
oftentimes
sore
abused
at
plaies
and
sportes
pompes
and
daunces
spendynge
golde
and
sylver
and
grete
fynaunces
for
faut
of
a
wyfe
the
cause
is
all
to
late
maryed
men
may
me
hence
he
proceeds
to
narrate
his
early
courses
especially
his
amours
with
he
says
i
withhelde
ony
praty
one
swetely
ynough
she
made
me
chere
sayenge
that
she
loved
no
persone
but
me
and
therto
she
dyde
swere
but
whan
i
wente
fro
that
place
there
unto
another
she
dyde
as
moche
for
they
love
none
but
for
theyr
his
male
companions
were
about
upon
a
par
with
his
female
and
upon
both
he
wasted
his
substance
but
having
at
last
married
he
imagined
that
he
had
only
to
enjoy
tranquillity
and
happiness
and
exclaimed
am
i
out
of
this
daunger
so
alenge
wherfore
i
am
gladde
it
for
to
persever
longe
about
have
i
ben
me
for
to
renge
but
it
is
better
to
late
than
to
be
never
certes
i
was
not
in
my
lyfe
tyll
hyther
so
full
of
joye
that
doth
in
my
herte
inspyre
wedded
folke
have
tyme
at
theyr
on
trying
the
experiment
he
by
no
means
finds
it
answer
his
expectation
besides
other
evils
he
says
i
am
to
be
full
of
jalousy
and
he
admits
in
plain
terms
that
his
young
wife
has
no
great
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
her
old
husband
he
observes
is
sayd
that
a
man
in
servytude
hym
putteth
whan
he
doth
to
woman
bende
he
ne
hath
but
only
habytude
unto
her
the
whiche
well
doth
hym
tende
who
wyll
to
householde
comprehende
and
there
a
bout
studyeth
in
youth
alwayes
he
shall
have
honoure
in
his
olde
dayes
chyldren
unto
the
courtes
hauntes
and
ben
purvayed
of
benefyces
some
haunteth
markettes
and
be
marchauntes
byenge
and
sellynge
theyr
marchaundyses
or
elles
constytuted
in
offyces
theyr
faders
and
moders
have
grete
solace
that
to
late
maryed
by
no
waye
hase
be
wayll
the
tyme
that
is
so
spent
that
i
ne
me
hasted
for
to
wedde
for
i
shall
have
herytage
and
rente
both
golde
and
sylver
and
kynred
but
syth
that
our
lorde
hath
ordeyned
that
i
this
sacrament
take
me
upon
i
wyll
kepe
it
trewely
at
all
in
the
subsequent
stanza
which
occurs
soon
afterwards
the
author
seems
to
allude
to
the
first
of
the
three
tracts
now
under
consideration
that
there
be
ony
tryfelers
that
have
wylled
for
to
blame
maryage
i
dare
well
saye
that
they
ben
but
lyers
or
elles
god
fayled
in
the
fyrste
age
adam
bereth
wytnesse
and
tesmonage
maryed
he
was
and
comen
we
ben
god
dyde
choyse
maryage
unto
all
this
stanza
affords
an
instance
of
the
employment
of
an
anglicised
french
word
because
it
happened
to
answer
the
purpose
as
a
rhyme
to
his
objection
is
not
to
marriage
generally
but
to
marriage
when
a
man
has
ceased
to
be
the
subject
of
amorous
affection
for
he
says
expressly
they
that
by
theyr
subtyll
artes
hath
wylled
for
to
blame
maryage
i
wyll
susteyne
that
they
be
bastardes
or
at
least
wage
an
evyll
courage
for
to
saye
that
therein
is
servage
in
maryage
but
i
it
reny
for
therin
is
but
humayne
company
ther
be
yll
women
and
rebell
shrewed
dispytous
and
eke
felonyous
there
be
other
fayre
and
do
full
well
propre
gentyll
lusty
and
joyous
that
ben
full
of
grace
and
vertuous
they
ben
not
all
born
under
a
sygnet
happy
is
he
that
a
good
one
can
he
adds
just
afterwards
playne
ye
the
tyme
that
ye
have
lost
mary
you
be
tyme
as
the
wyse
man
sayth
tossed
i
have
ben
fro
pyler
to
post
in
commersynge
natures
werke
alwayes
i
have
passed
full
many
quasy
dayes
that
now
unto
good
i
can
not
mate
for
mary
i
dyde
my
selfe
to
in
the
second
line
we
ought
to
read
for
as
the
rhyme
evidently
shews
the
last
stanza
of
the
body
of
the
poem
is
in
the
same
spirit
it
is
in
youth
a
wyfe
for
to
take
and
lyve
with
her
to
goddes
pleasaunce
than
to
go
in
age
for
goddes
sake
in
worldly
sorowe
and
perturbaunce
for
youthes
love
and
utteraunce
and
than
to
dye
at
the
last
ende
and
be
dampned
in
hell
with
the
foule
the
three
terminating
stanzas
consist
of
a
supplementary
address
from
auctour
the
last
containing
the
imprint
or
colophon
as
already
inserted
the
work
is
ended
by
wynkyn
de
well
known
tripartite
device
we
now
proceed
to
insert
in
its
entire
shape
the
third
tract
upon
this
amusing
subject
premising
that
like
our
preceding
quotations
it
is
from
an
unique
copy
it
will
remind
the
reader
in
several
places
of
passages
in
the
prologue
of
of
bath
especially
where
she
remarks
sayst
droppyng
houses
and
eke
smoke
and
chidyng
wyves
maken
men
to
flee
out
of
her
owne
houses
ah
benedicite
what
ayleth
suche
an
olde
man
for
to
chide
but
the
wife
of
bath
does
not
quote
solomon
for
the
proverb
as
we
find
him
referred
to
on
again
in
a
subsequent
stanza
we
are
strongly
reminded
of
the
lines
where
the
wife
of
bath
thus
describes
her
conduct
after
she
had
married
her
fifth
husband
made
i
my
visytations
to
vigilles
and
to
processyons
to
preachyng
eke
and
to
pilgrymages
to
playes
of
myracles
and
to
mariages
and
weared
on
my
gay
skarlet
the
main
difference
is
that
instead
of
saying
with
chaucer
that
women
frequent
of
myracles
the
author
of
the
ensuing
tract
tells
us
that
they
delight
scaffoldes
to
sytte
on
high
stages
from
whence
they
usually
beheld
such
performances
throughout
the
writer
seems
to
have
had
our
great
early
poet
more
or
less
in
his
eye
and
hence
we
may
possibly
conclude
that
if
the
two
other
pieces
on
the
same
subject
were
translations
this
was
original
it
therefore
deserves
the
more
attention
the
payne
and
sorowe
of
evyll
maryage
the
