the
inestimable
value
of
literature
in
supplying
healthful
recreation
in
opening
the
mind
to
larger
views
of
life
and
in
creating
ideals
that
shall
mold
the
spiritual
nature
is
conceded
now
by
every
one
who
has
intelligently
considered
the
problems
of
education
but
the
basis
upon
which
literature
shall
be
selected
and
arranged
is
still
a
matter
of
discussion
chronology
correlation
and
ethical
training
should
all
be
recognized
incidentally
but
the
main
purpose
of
the
teacher
of
literature
is
to
send
children
on
into
life
with
a
genuine
love
for
good
reading
to
accomplish
this
three
things
should
be
true
of
the
reading
offered
first
it
should
be
second
it
should
be
literature
of
some
scope
not
merely
some
small
phase
of
literature
such
as
the
fables
or
the
poetry
of
one
of
the
less
eminent
poets
and
third
it
should
appeal
to
children
natural
interests
children
interests
varied
as
they
seem
center
in
the
marvelous
and
the
preternatural
in
the
natural
world
and
in
human
life
especially
child
life
and
the
romantic
and
heroic
aspects
of
mature
life
in
the
selections
made
for
each
grade
we
have
recognized
these
different
interests
to
grade
poetry
perfectly
for
different
ages
is
an
impossibility
much
of
the
greatest
verse
is
for
all
ages
that
is
one
reason
why
it
great
a
child
of
five
will
lisp
the
numbers
of
horatius
with
delight
and
scott
of
an
infant
with
its
romantic
color
and
its
exquisite
human
tenderness
is
dear
to
childhood
to
manhood
and
to
old
age
but
the
land
of
song
is
a
great
undiscovered
country
to
the
little
child
by
some
road
or
other
he
must
find
his
way
into
it
and
these
volumes
simply
attempt
to
point
out
a
path
through
which
he
may
be
led
into
its
happy
fields

it
would

the

i
wandered
lonely
as
a
cloud
that
floats
on

and
hills
when
all
at
once
i
saw
a
crowd
a
host
of
golden
daffodils
beside
the
lake
beneath
the
trees
fluttering
and
dancing
in
the
breeze
continuous
as
the
stars
that
shine
and
twinkle
on
the

way
they
stretched
in
line
along
the
margin

ten

saw
i
at
a
glance
tossing
their
heads
in
sprightly
dance
the
waves
beside
them
danced
but
they
outdid
the
sparkling
waves
in
glee
a
poet
could
not
but
be
gay
in
such
a
jocund
company
i
gazed
and
gazed
but
little
thought
what
wealth
the
show
to
me
had
brought
for
oft
when
on
my
couch
i
lie
in
vacant
or
in
pensive
mood
they
flash
upon
that
inward
eye
which
is
the
bliss
of
solitude
and
then
my
heart
with
pleasure
fills
and
dances
with
the
daffodils

passed
and
the
eyes

sleepers
waxed
deadly
and
chill
and
their
hearts

once
heaved
and
forever
grew
still
and
there
lay
the
steed
with
his
nostril
all
wide
but
through
it
there
rolled
not
the
breath
of
his
pride
and
the
foam
of
his
gasping
lay
white
on

cold
as

there
lay

distorted

with

rushed

louder
than

flashed
the

not

was

note
as

we
hurried

our

we
buried
we
buried
him
darkly
at

the

with
our
bayonets
turning
by
the
struggling
moonbeam
misty
light
and
the
lantern
dimly
burning
no
useless
coffin
inclosed
his
breast
not
in
sheet
nor
in
shroud
we
wound
him
but
he
lay
like
a
warrior
taking
his
rest
with
his
martial
cloak
around
him
few
and
short
were
the
prayers
we
said
and
we
spoke
not
a
word
of
sorrow
but
we
steadfastly
gazed
on
the
face
that
was
dead
and
we
bitterly
thought
of
the
morrow
we
thought
as
we
hollowed
his
narrow
bed
and
smoothed
down
his
lonely
pillow
that
the
foe
and
the
stranger
would
tread
his
head
and
we
far
away
on
the
billow
lightly
they
talk
of
the
spirit
that
gone
and
his
cold
ashes
upbraid
him
but
little
he
reck
if
they
let
him
sleep
on
in
the
grave
where
a
briton
has
laid
him
but
half
of
our
heavy
task
was
done
when
the
clock
struck
the
hour
for
retiring
and
we
heard
the
distant
and
random
gun
that
the
foe
was
sullenly
firing
slowly
and
sadly
we
laid
him
down
from
the
field
of
his
fame
fresh
and
gory
we
carved
not
a
line
and
we
raised
not
a
stone
but
we
left
him
alone
with
his
glory

o
blithe
newcomer
i
have
heard
i
hear
thee
and
rejoice
o
cuckoo
shall
i
call
thee
bird
or
but
a
wandering
voice
while
i
am
lying
on
the
grass
thy
twofold
shout
i
hear
from
hill
to
hill
it
seems
to
pass
at
once
far
off
and
near
though
babbling
only
to
the
vale
of
sunshine
and
of
flowers
thou
bringest
unto
me
a
tale
of
visionary
hours
thrice
welcome
darling
of
the
spring
even
yet
thou
art
to
me
no
bird
but
an
invisible
thing
a
voice
a
mystery
the
same
whom
in
my
schoolboy
days
i
listened
to
that
cry
which
made
me
look
a
thousand
ways
in
bush
and
tree
and
sky
to
seek
thee
did
i
often
rove
through
woods
and
on
the
green
and
thou
wert
still
a
hope
a
love
still
longed
for
never
seen
and
i
can
listen
to
thee
yet
can
lie
upon
the
plain
and
listen
till
i
do
beget
that
golden
time
again
o
blessèd
bird
the
earth
we
pace
again
appears
to
be
an
unsubstantial
fairy
place
that
is
fit
home
for
thee

one

a

hang
between

a
singing
speck
above
the

a
stage

in
gay
accord
white

danced
on

the

soared

silent
sank
and
soared
to
sing

cornfield
stretched
a
tender
green
to
right
and
left
beside
my
walks
i
knew
he
had
a
nest
unseen
somewhere
among

stalks

as
i
paused
to
hear
his
song

swift
the
sunny
moments
slid

his
mate
sat
listening
long
and
listened
longer

the
stormy
march
is
come
at
last
with
wind
and
cloud
and
changing
skies
i
hear
the
rushing
of
the
blast
that
through
the
snowy
valley
flies
ah
passing
few
are
those
who
speak
wild
stormy
month
in
praise
of
thee
yet
though
thy
winds
are
loud
and
bleak
thou
art
a
welcome
month
to
me
for
thou
to
northern
lands
again
the
glad
and
glorious
sun
dost
bring
and
thou
hast
joined
the
gentle
train
and
the
gentle
name
of
spring
and
in
thy
reign
of
blast
and
storm
smiles
many
a
long
bright
sunny
day
when
the
changed
winds
are
soft
and
warm
and
heaven
puts
on
the
blue
of
may
then
sing
aloud
the
gushing
rills
in
joy
that
they
again
are
free
and
brightly
leaping
down
the
hills
begin
their
journey
to
the
sea
the
year
departing
beauty
hides
of
wintry
storms
the
sullen
threat
but
in
thy
sternest
frown
abides
a
look
of
kindly
promise
yet
thou
the
hope
of
those
calm
skies
and
that
soft
time
of
sunny
showers
when
the
wide
bloom
on
earth
that
lies
seems
of
a
brighter

our

as
for

shocking
to

lined
with

for

as

we

packing
at
this
the
mayor
and
corporation
quaked
with
a
mighty
consternation
an
hour
they
sat
in
council
at
length
the
mayor
broke
silence
for
a
guilder
i
my
ermine
gown
sell
i
wish
i
were
a
mile
hence
it
easy
to
bid
one
rack

i
sure
my
poor
head
aches
again
i
scratched
it
so
and
all
in
vain
oh
for
a
trap
a
trap
a
trap
just
as
he
said
this
what
should
hap
at
the
chamber
door
but
a
gentle
tap
bless
us
cried
the
mayor
what
that
anything
like
the
sound
of
a
rat
makes
my
heart
go
pitapat
come
in
the
mayor
cried
looking
bigger
and
in
did
come
the
strangest
figure
his
queer
long
coat
from
heel
to
head
was
half
of
yellow
and
half
of
red
and
he
himself
was
tall
and
thin
with
sharp
blue
eyes
each
like
a
pin
and
light
loose
hair
yet
swarthy
skin
no
tuft
on
cheek
nor
beard
on
chin
but
lips
where
smiles
went
out
and
in
there
was
no
guessing
his
kith
and
kin
and
nobody
could
enough
admire
the
tall
man
and
his
quaint
attire
quoth
one
it
as
my
starting
up
at
the
trump
of
doom
tone
had
walked
this
way
from
his
painted
tombstone
he
advanced
to
the
council
table
and
please
your
honors
said
he
i
able
by
means
of
a
secret
charm
to
draw
all
creatures
living
beneath
the
sun
that
creep
or
swim
or
fly
or
run
after
me
so
as
you
never
saw
and
i
chiefly
use
my
charm
on
creatures
that
do
people
harm
the
mole
the
toad
the
newt
the
viper
and
people
call
me
the
pied
piper
and
here
they
noticed
round
his
neck
a
scarf
of
red
and
yellow
stripe
to
match
with
his
coat
of
the
selfsame
check
and
at
the
scarf
end
hung
a
pipe
and
his
fingers
they
noticed
were
ever
straying
as
if
impatient
to
be
playing
upon
this
pipe
as
low
it
dangled
over
his
vesture
so
old
fangled
yet
said
he
poor
piper
as
i
am
in
tartary
i
freed
the
cham
last
june
from
his
huge
swarm
of
gnats
i
eased
in
asia
the
nizam
of
a
monstrous
brood
of
vampire
bats
and
as
for
what
your
brain
bewilders
if
i
can
rid
your
town
of
rats
will
you
give
me
a
thousand
guilders
one
fifty
thousand
was
the
exclamation
of
the
astonished
mayor
and
corporation
into
the
street
the
piper
stept
smiling
first
a
little
smile
as
if
he
knew
what
magic
slept
in
his
quiet
pipe
the
while
then
like
a
musical
adept
to
blow
the
pipe
his
lips
he
wrinkled
and
green
and
blue
his
sharp
eyes
twinkled
like
a
candle
flame
where
salt
is
sprinkled
and
ere
three
shrill
notes
the
pipe
had
uttered
you
heard
as
if
an
army
muttered
and
the
muttering
grew
into
a
grumbling
and
the
grumbling
grew
to
a
mighty
rumbling
and
out
of
the
houses
the
rats
came
tumbling
great
rats
small
rats
lean
rats
brawny
rats
brown
rats
black
rats
gray
rats
tawny
rats
grave
old
plodders
gay
young
friskers
fathers
mothers
uncles
cousins
curling
tails
and
pricking
whiskers
families
by
tens
and
dozens
brothers
sisters
husbands
wives
followed
the
piper
for
their
lives
from
street
to
street
he
piped
advancing
and
step
for
step
they
followed
dancing
until
they
came
to
the
river
weser
wherein
all
plunged
and
perished
save
one
who
stout
as
julius
cæsar
swam
across
and
lived
to
carry
as
he
the
manuscript
he
cherished
to
home
his
commentary
which
was
at
the
first
shrill
notes
of
the
pipe
i
heard
a
sound
as
of
scraping
tripe
and
putting
apples
wondrous
ripe
into
a
cider
press
gripe
and
a
moving
away
of
boards
and
a
leaving
ajar
of
conserve
cupboards
and
a
drawing
the
corks
of
flasks
and
a
breaking
the
hoops
of
butter
casks
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
voice
sweeter
far
than
by
harp
or
by
psaltery
is
breathed
called
out
o
rats
rejoice
the
world
is
grown
to
one
vast
drysaltery
so
munch
on
crunch
on
take
your
nuncheon
breakfast
dinner
supper
luncheon
and
just
as
a
bulky
sugar
puncheon
all
ready
staved
like
a
great
sun
shone
glorious
scarce
an
inch
before
me
just
as
methought
it
said
bore
me
i
found
the
weser
rolling
me
you
should
have
heard
the
hamelin
people
ringing
the
bells
till
they
rocked
the
steeple
go
cried
the
mayor
and
get
long
poles
poke
out
the
nests
and
block
up
the
holes
consult
with
carpenters
and
builders
and
leave
in
town
not
even
a
trace
of
the
rats
when
suddenly
up
the
face
of
the
piper
perked
in
the
market
place
with
a
first
if
you
please
my
thousand
guilders
a
thousand
guilders
the
mayor
looked
blue
so
did
the
corporation
too
for
council
dinners
made
rare
havoc
with
claret
moselle
hock
and
half
the
money
would
replenish
their
cellar
biggest
butt
with
rhenish
to
pay
this
sum
to
a
wandering
fellow
with
a
gypsy
coat
of
red
and
yellow
besides
quoth
the
mayor
with
a
knowing
wink
our
business
was
done
at
the
river
brink
we
saw
with
our
eyes
the
vermin
sink
and
what
dead
ca
come
to
life
i
think
so
friend
we
not
the
folks
to
shrink
from
the
duty
of
giving
you
something
for
drink
and
a
matter
of
money
to
put
in
your
poke
but
as
for
the
guilders
what
we
spoke
of
them
as
you
very
well
know
was
in
joke
beside
our
losses
have
made
us
thrifty
a
thousand
guilders
come
take
fifty
the
piper
face
fell
and
he
cried
no
trifling
i
ca
wait
beside
i
promised
to
visit
by
dinner
time
bagdat
and
accept
the
prime
of
the
head
cook
pottage
all
he
rich
in
for
having
left
in
the
caliph
kitchen
of
a
nest
of
scorpions
no
survivor
with
him
i
proved
no
with
you
do
think
i
bate
a
stiver
and
folks
who
put
me
in
a
passion
may
find
me
pipe
to
another
fashion
how
cried
the
mayor
d
think
i
brook
being
worse
treated
than
a
cook
insulted
by
a
lazy
ribald
with
idle
pipe
and
vesture
piebald
you
threaten
us
fellow
do
your
worst
blow
your
pipe
there
till
you
burst
once
more
he
stept
into
the
street
and
to
his
lips
again
laid
his
long
pipe
of
smooth
straight
cane
and
ere
he
blew
three
notes
such
sweet
soft
notes
as
yet
musician
cunning
never
gave
the
enraptured
air
there
was
a
rustling
that
seemed
like
a
bustling
of
merry
crowds
justling
at
pitching
and
hustling
small
feet
were
pattering
wooden
shoes
clattering
little
hands
clapping
and
little
tongues
chattering
and
like
fowls
in
a
farmyard
when
barley
is
scattering
out
came
the
children
running
all
the
little
boys
and
girls
with
rosy
cheeks
and
flaxen
curls
and
sparkling
eyes
and
teeth
like
pearls
tripping
and
skipping
ran
merrily
after
the
wonderful
music
with
shouting
and
laughter
the
mayor
was
dumb
and
the
council
stood
as
if
they
were
changed
into
blocks
of
wood
unable
to
move
a
step
or
cry
to
the
children
merrily
skipping
by
and
could
only
follow
with
the
eye
that
joyous
crowd
at
the
piper
back
and
now
the
mayor
was
on
the
rack
and
the
wretched
council
bosoms
beat
as
the
piper
turned
from
the
high
street
to
where
the
weser
rolled
its
waters
right
in
the
way
of
their
sons
and
daughters
however
he
turned
from
south
to
west
and
to
koppelberg
hill
his
steps
addressed
and
after
him
the
children
pressed
great
was
the
joy
in
every
breast
he
never
can
cross
that
mighty
top
he
forced
to
let
the
piping
drop
and
we
shall
see
our
children
stop
when
lo
as
they
reached
the
mountain
side
a
wondrous
portal
opened
wide
as
if
a
cavern
was
suddenly
hollowed
and
the
piper
advanced
and
the
children
followed
and
when
all
were
in
to
the
very
last
the
door
in
the
mountain
side
shut
fast
did
i
say
all
no
one
was
lame
and
could
not
dance
the
whole
of
the
way
and
in
after
years
if
you
would
blame
his
sadness
he
was
used
to
say
it
dull
in
our
town
since
my
playmates
left
i
ca
forget
that
i
bereft
of
all
the
pleasant
sights
they
see
which
the
piper
also
promised
me
for
he
led
us
he
said
to
a
joyous
land
joining
the
town
and
just
at
hand
where
waters
gushed
and
fruit
trees
grew
and
flowers
put
forth
a
fairer
hue
and
everything
was
strange
and
new
the
sparrows
were
brighter
than
peacocks
here
and
their
dogs
outran
our
fallow
deer
and
honeybees
had
lost
their
stings
and
horses
were
born
with
eagles
wings
and
just
as
i
became
assured
my
lame
foot
would
be
speedily
cured
the
music
stopped
and
i
stood
still
and
found
myself
outside
the
hill
left
alone
against
my
will
to
go
now
limping
as
before
and
never
hear
of
that
country
more
illustration
the
pied
piper
of
hamelin
h
kaulbach
the
mayor
sent
east
west
north
and
south
to
offer
the
piper
by
word
of
mouth
wherever
it
was
man
lot
to
find
him
silver
and
gold
to
his
heart
content
if
he
only
return
the
way
he
went
and
bring
the
children
behind
him
but
when
they
saw
was
a
lost
endeavor
and
piper
and
dancers
were
gone
forever
they
made
a
decree
that
lawyers
never
should
think
their
records
dated
duly
if
after
the
day
of
the
month
and
year
these
words
did
not
as
well
appear
and
so
long
after
what
happened
here
on
the
of
july
thirteen
hundred
and
and
the
better
in
memory
to
fix
the
place
of
the
children
last
retreat
they
called
it
the
pied
piper
street
where
any
one
playing
on
pipe
or
tabor
was
sure
for
the
future
to
lose
his
labor
nor
suffered
they
hostelry
or
tavern
to
shock
with
mirth
a
street
so
solemn
but
opposite
the
place
of
the
cavern
they
wrote
the
story
on
a
column
and
on
the
great
church
window
painted
the
same
to
make
the
world
acquainted
how
their
children
were
stolen
away
and
there
it
stands
to
this
very
day
and
i
must
not
omit
to
say
that
in
transylvania
there
a
tribe
of
alien
people
that
ascribe
the
outlandish
ways
and
dress
on
which
their
neighbors
lay
such
stress
to
their
fathers
and
mothers
having
risen
out
of
some
subterraneous
prison
into
which
they
were
trepanned
long
ago
in
a
mighty
band
out
of
hamelin
town
in
brunswick
land
but
how
or
why
they
do
understand
so
willy
let
you
and
me
be
wipers
of
scores
out
with
all
men
especially
pipers
and
whether
they
pipe
us
free
from
rats
or
from
mice
if
we
promised
them
aught
let
us
keep
our
promise

of

in

dwelt
of
late
who
did
in
honor
far
surmount
most
men
of
his
estate
sore
sick
he
was
and
like
to
die
no
help
his
life
could
save
his
wife
by
him
as
sick
did
lie
and
both
possessed
one
grave
no
love
between
these
two
was
lost
each
was
to
other
kind
in
love
they
lived
in
love
they
died
and
left
two
babes
behind
the
one
a
fine
and
pretty
boy
not
passing
three
years
old
the
other
a
girl
more
young
than
he
and
framed
in
beauty
mold
the
father
left
his
little
son
as
plainly
doth
appear
when
he
to
perfect
age
should
come
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
to
his
little
daughter
jane
five
hundred
pounds
in
gold
to
be
paid
down
on
her
marriage
day
which
might
not
be
controlled
but
if
the
children
chanced
to
die
ere
they
to
age
should
come
their
uncle
should
possess
their
wealth
for
so
the
will
did
run
now
brother
said
the
dying
man
look
to
my
children
dear
be
good
unto
my
boy
and
girl
no
friends
else
have
they
here
to
god
and
you
i
recommend
my
children
dear
this
day
but
little
while
be
sure
we
have
within
this
world
to
stay
you
must
be
father
and
mother
both
and
uncle
all
in
one
god
knows
what
will
become
of
them
when
i
am
dead
and
gone
with
that
bespake
their
mother
dear
o
brother
kind
quoth
she
you
are
the
man
must
bring
our
babes
to
wealth
or
misery
and
if
you
keep
them
carefully
then
god
will
you
reward
but
if
you
otherwise
should
deal
god
will
your
deeds
regard
with
lips
as
cold
as
any
stone
they
kissed
their
children
small
god
bless
you
both
my
children
dear
with
that
their
tears
did
fall
these
speeches
then
their
brother
spake
to
this
sick
couple
there
the
keeping
of
your
little
ones
sweet
sister
do
not
fear
god
never
prosper
me
or
mine
nor
aught
else
that
i
have
if
i
do
wrong
your
children
dear
when
you
are
laid
in
grave
the
parents
being
dead
and
gone
the
children
home
he
takes
and
brings
them
straight
unto
his
house
where
much
of
them
he
makes
he
had
not
kept
these
pretty
babes
a
twelvemonth
and
a
day
but
for
their
wealth
he
did
devise
to
make
them
both
away
he
bargained
with
two
ruffians
strong
which
were
of
furious
mood
that
they
should
take
these
children
young
and
slay
them
in
a
wood
he
told
his
wife
an
artful
tale
he
would
the
children
send
to
be
brought
up
in
fair
london
with
one
that
was
his
friend
away
then
went
those
pretty
babes
rejoicing
at
that
tide
rejoicing
with
a
merry
mind
they
should
on
cockhorse
ride
they
prate
and
prattle
pleasantly
as
they
rode
on
the
way
to
those
that
should
their
butchers
be
and
work
their
lives
decay
so
that
the
pretty
speech
they
had
made
murder
heart
relent
and
they
that
undertook
the
deed
full
sore
did
now
repent
yet
one
of
them
more
hard
of
heart
did
vow
to
do
his
charge
because
the
wretch
that
hired
him
had
paid
him
very
large
the
other
wo
agree
thereto
so
here
they
fall
to
strife
with
one
another
they
did
fight
about
the
children
life
and
he
that
was
of
mildest
mood
did
slay
the
other
there
within
an
unfrequented
wood
the
babes
did
quake
for
fear
he
took
the
children
by
the
hand
tears
standing
in
their
eye
and
bade
them
straightway
follow
him
and
look
they
did
not
cry
and
two
long
miles
he
led
them
on
while
they
for
food
complain
stay
here
quoth
he
i
bring
you
bread
when
i
come
back
again
these
pretty
babes
with
hand
in
hand
went
wandering
up
and
down
but
never
more
could
see
the
man
approaching
from
the
town
their
pretty
lips
with
blackberries
were
all
besmeared
and
dyed
and
when
they
saw
the
darksome
night
they
sat
them
down
and
cried
thus
wandered
these
poor
innocents
till
death
did
end
their
grief
in
one
another
arms
they
died
as
wanting
due
relief
no
burial
this
pretty
pair
of
any
man
received
till
robin
redbreast
piously
did
cover
them
with
leaves
and
now
the
heavy
wrath
of
god
upon
their
uncle
fell
yea
fearful
fiends
did
haunt
his
house
his
conscience
felt
an
hell
his
barns
were
fired
his
goods
consumed
his
lands
were
barren
made
his
cattle
died
within
the
field
and
nothing
with
him
stayed
and
in
the
voyage
to
portugal
two
of
his
sons
did
die
and
to
conclude
himself
was
brought
to
want
and
misery
he
pawned
and
mortgaged
all
his
land
ere
seven
years
came
about
and
now
at
length
this
wicked
act
did
by
this
means
come
out
the
fellow
that
did
take
in
hand
these
children
for
to
kill

you

flew

against

you
heard
forbidding

the

did
you
kill

chased

you
left

heard

harder
to
withstand
you
cried
forbear
but
in

a
mightier
cried
proceed
was
nature
sir
whose
strong
behest
impelled
me
to
the
deed
yet
much
as
nature
i
respect
i
ventured
once
to
break
as
you
perhaps
may
recollect
her
precept
for
your
sake
and
when
your
linnet
on
a
day
passing
his
prison
door
had
fluttered
all
his
strength
away
and
panting
pressed
the
floor

him

destined

kissed

licked

my

then
excuse
my
disobedience

some

yourself

the

a
true
story
the
merry
boats
of
brixham
go
out
to
search
the
seas
a
stanch
and
sturdy
fleet
are
they
who
love
a
swinging
breeze
and
before
the
woods
of
devon
and
the
silver
cliffs
of
wales
you
may
see
when
summer
evenings
fall
the
light
upon
their
sails
but
when
the
year
grows
darker
and
gray
winds
hunt
the
foam
they
go
back
to
little
brixham
and
ply
their
toil
at
home
and
thus
it
chanced
one
winter
night
when
a
storm
began
to
roar
that
all
the
men
were
out
at
sea
and
all
the
wives
on
shore
then
as
the
wind
grew
fiercer
the
women
cheeks
grew
white
it
was
fiercer
in
the
twilight
and
fiercest
in
the
night
the
strong
clouds
set
themselves
like
ice
without
a
star
to
melt
the
blackness
of
the
darkness
was
darkness
to
be
felt
the
old
men
they
were
anxious
they
dreaded
what
they
knew
what
do
you
think
the
women
did
love
taught
them
what
to
do
out
spake
a
wife
we
beds
at
home
we
burn
them
for
a
light
give
us
the
men
and
the
bare
ground
we
want
no
more
they
took
the
grandame
blanket
who
shivered
and
bade
them
go
they
took
the
baby
pillow
who
could
not
say
them
no
and
they
heaped
a
great
fire
on
the
pier
and
knew
not
all
the
while
if
they
were
heaping
a
bonfire
or
only
a
funeral
pile
and
fed
with
precious
food
the
flame
shone
bravely
on
the
black
till
a
cry
rang
through
the
people
a
boat
is
coming
back
staggering
dimly
through
the
fog
come
shapes
of
fear
and
doubt
but
when
the
first
prow
strikes
the
pier
can
not
you
hear
them
shout
then
all
along
the
breath
of
flame
dark
figures
shrieked
and
ran
with
child
here
comes
your
father
or
wife
is
this
your
man
and
faint
feet
touch
the
welcome
shore
and
wait
a
little
while
and
kisses
drop
from
frozen
lips
too
tired
to
speak
or
smile
so
one
by
one
they
struggled
in
all
that
the
sea
would
spare
we
will
not
reckon
through
our
tears
the
names
that
were
not
there
but
some
went
home
without
a
bed
when
all
the
tale
was
told
who
were
too
cold
with
sorrow
to
know
the
night
was
cold
and
this
is
what
the
men
must
do
who
work
in
wind
and
foam
and
this
is
what
the
women
bear
who
watch
for
them
at
home
so
when
you
see
a
brixham
boat
go
out
to
face
the
gales
think
of
the
love
that
travels
like
light
upon

when

aghast
the

stood
the

was
smeared
with
gouts
of

his
lips

ran

llewellyn
gazed
with
wild
surprise
unused
such
looks
to
meet
his
checked
his
joyful
guise
and
crouched
and
licked
his
feet
onward
in
haste
llewellyn
passed
and
on
went
gelert
too
and
still
his
eyes
were
cast
fresh
blood
gouts
shocked
his
view
his
infant
bed
he
found
the
bloodstained
cover
rent
and
all
around
the
walls
and
ground
with
recent
blood
besprent
he
called
his
child
no
voice
replied
he
searched
with
terror
wild
blood
blood
he
found
on
every
side
but
nowhere
found
his
child
by
thee
my
child
devoured
the
frantic
father
cried
and
to
the
hilt
his
vengeful
sword
he
plunged
in
gelert
side
his
suppliant
as
to
earth
he
fell
no
pity
could
impart
but
still
his
gelert
dying
yell
passed
heavy
his
heart
aroused
by
gelert
dying
yell
some
slumberer
wakened
nigh
what
words
the
parent
joy
can
tell
to
hear
his

cry
concealed
beneath
a
mangled
heap
his
hurried
search
had
missed
all
glowing
from
his
rosy
sleep
his
cherub
boy
he
kissed
nor
scratch
had
he
nor
harm
nor
dread
but
the
same
couch
beneath
lay
a
great
wolf
all
torn
and
dead
tremendous
still
in
death
ah
what
was
then
llewellyn
pain
for
now
the
truth
was
clear
the
gallant
hound
the
wolf
had
slain
to
save
llewellyn

vain
vain
was
all
llewellyn
woe
best
of
thy
kind
adieu

frantic

laid
thee

proved
and
here

hung

fell

piercing

would
hear

robert
southey
fidelity
a
barking
sound
the
shepherd
hears
a
cry
as
of
a
dog
or
fox
he
halts
and
searches
with
his
eyes
among
the
scattered
rocks
and
now
at
distance
can
discern
a
stirring
in
a
brake
of
fern
and
instantly
a
dog
is
seen
glancing
through
that
covert
green
the
dog
is
not
of
mountain
breed
its
motions
too
are
wild
and
shy
with
something
as
the
shepherd
thinks
unusual
in
its
cry
nor
is
there
anyone
in
sight
all
round
in
hollow
or
on
height
nor
shout
nor
whistle
strikes
his
ear
what
is
the
creature
doing
here
it
was
a
cove
a
huge
recess
that
keeps
till
june
december

a
lofty
precipice
in
front
a
silent
tarn
below
far
in
the
bosom
of
helvellyn
remote
from
public
road
or
dwelling
pathway
or
cultivated
land
from
trace
of
human
foot
or
hand
there
sometimes
doth
a
leaping
fish
send
through
the
tarn
a
lonely
cheer
the
crags
repeat
the
raven
croak
in
symphony
austere
thither
the
rainbow
comes
the
cloud
and
mists
that
spread
the
flying
shroud
and
sunbeams
and
the
sounding
blast
that
if
it
could
would
hurry
past
but
that
enormous
barrier
holds
it
fast
not
free
from
boding
thoughts
a
while
the
shepherd
stood
then
makes
his
way
rocks
and
stones
following
the
dog
as
quickly
as
he
may
nor
far
had
gone
before
he
found
a
human
skeleton
on
the
ground
the
appalled
discoverer
with
a
sigh
looks
round
to
learn
the
history
from
those
abrupt
and
perilous
rocks
the
man
had
fallen
that
place
of
fear
at
length
upon
the
shepherd
mind
it
breaks
and
all
is
clear
he
instantly
recalled
the
name
and
who
he
was
and
whence
he
came
remembered
too
the
very
day
on
which
the
traveler
passed
this
way
but
hear
a
wonder
for
whose
sake
this
lamentable
tale
i
tell
a
lasting
monument
of
words
this
wonder
merits
well
the
dog
which
still
was
hovering
nigh
repeating
the
same
timid
cry
this
dog
had
been
through
three
months
space
a
dweller
in
that
savage
place
yes
proof
was
plain
that
since
the
day
when
this
traveler
died
the
dog
had
watched
about
the
spot
or
by
his
master
side
how
nourished
here
through
such
long
time
he
knows
who
gave
that
love
sublime
and
gave
that
strength
of
feeling
great
above
all

the

of

upon
a

a

steed
who
grazed
among
a
numerous
breed
with
mutiny
had
fired
the
train
and
spread
dissension
through
the
plain
on
matters
that
concerned
the

the
council
met
in
grand
debate
a
colt
whose
eyeballs
flamed
with
ire
elate
with
strength
and
youthful
fire
in
haste
stept
forth
before
the
rest
and
thus
the
listening
throng
addressed
goodness
how
abject
is
our
race
condemned
to
slavery
and
disgrace
shall
we
our
servitude
retain
because
our
sires
have
borne
the
chain
consider
friends
your
strength

might
is
conquest
to
assert
your
right
how
cumbrous
is
the
gilded
coach
the
pride
of
man
is
our
reproach
were
we
designed
for
daily
toil
to
drag
the
plowshare
through
the
soil
to
sweat
in
harness
through
the
road
to
groan
beneath
the
carrier
load
how
feeble
are
the

what
force
is
in
our
nerves
combined
shall
then
our
nobler
jaws
submit
to
foam
and
champ
the
galling
bit
shall
haughty
man
my

bestride
shall
the
sharp

provoke
my

forbid

at

a
general
nod
approved
the
cause
and
all
the

neighed
applause
when
lo
with
grave
and
solemn
pace
a
steed
advanced
before
the
race
with
age
and
long
experience
wise
around
he
cast
his
thoughtful
eyes

to
the
murmurs
of

thus
spoke
the
nestor
of

when
i
had
health

doth
he
not

through
all
the

of

how
many

us

up

penny

abbot

canterbury
but
i
his
poor
shepherd

may
see
that

come
to
beg
pardon
for
him
and
for
me
the
king

such
speed

nobles

week

i
will
give
thee
for
this
merry
jest
thou
hast
shown
unto
me
and
tell
the
old
abbot
when
thou
home
thou
hast
brought
him
a
pardon
from
good
king
john
thomas
percy
to
the
small
celandine
pansies
lilies
kingcups
daisies
let
them
live
upon
their
praises
long
as
there
a
sun
that
sets
primroses
will
have
their
glory
long
as
there
are
violets
they
will
have
a
place
in
story
there
a
flower
that
shall
be
mine
is
the
little
celandine
eyes
of
some
men
travel
far
for
the
finding
of
a
star
up
and
down
the
heavens
they
go
men
that
keep
a
mighty
rout
i
as
great
as
they
i
trow
since
the
day
i
found
thee
out
little
flower
i
make
a
stir
like
a
sage
astronomer
modest
yet
withal
an
elf
bold
and
lavish
of
thyself
since
we
needs
must
first
have
met
i
have
seen
thee
high
and
low
thirty
years
or
more
and
yet
was
a
face
i
did
not
know
thou
hast
now
go
where
i
may
fifty
greetings
in
a
day
ere
a
leaf
is
on
a
bush
in
the
time
before
the
thrush
has
a
thought
about
her
nest
thou
wilt
come
with
half
a
call
spreading
out
thy
glossy
breast
like
a
careless
prodigal
telling
tales
about
the
sun
when
we
little
warmth
or
none
poets
vain
men
in
their
mood
travel
with
the
multitude
never
heed
them
i
aver
that
they
are
all
wanton
wooers
but
the
thrifty
cottager
who
stirs
little
out
of
doors
joys
to
spy
thee
near
her
home
spring
is
coming
thou
art
come
comfort
have
thou
of
thy
merit
kindly
unassuming
spirit
careless
of
thy
neighborhood
thou
dost
show
thy
pleasant
face
on
the
moor
and
in
the
wood
in
the
lane
there
not
a
place
howsoever
mean
it
be
but
is
good
enough
for
thee
ill
befall
the
yellow
flowers
children
of
the
flaring
hours
buttercups
that
will
be
seen
whether
we
will
see
or
no
others
too
of
lofty
mien
they
have
done
as
worldlings
do
taken
praise
that
should
be
thine
little
humble
celandine
prophet
of
delight
and
mirth
ill
requited
upon

of
a
mighty
band
of
a
joyous
train

at
my
heart

tasks
that
are
no
tasks
renewing
i
will
sing
as
doth
behove
hymns
in
praise
of
what
i
love
william
wordsworth
the
beleaguered
city
i
have
read
in
some
old
marvelous
tale
some
legend
strange
and
vague
that
a
midnight
host
of
specters
pale
beleaguered
the
walls
of
prague
beside
the
moldau
rushing
stream
with
the
wan
moon
overhead
there
stood
as
in
an
awful
dream
the
army
of
the
dead
white
as
a
sea
fog
landward
bound
the
spectral
camp
was
seen
and
with
a
sorrowful
deep
sound
the
river
flowed
between
no
other
voice
nor
sound
was
there
no
drum
nor
sentry
pace
the
mistlike
banners
clasped
the
air
as
clouds
with
clouds
embrace
but
when
the
old
cathedral
bell
proclaimed
the
morning
prayer
the
white
pavilions
rose
and
fell
on
the
alarmèd
air
illustration
henry
wadsworth
longfellow
down
the
broad
valley
fast
and
far
the
troubled
army
fled
up
rose
the
glorious
morning
star
the
ghastly
host
was
dead
i
have
read
in
the
marvelous
heart
of
man
that
strange
and
mystic
scroll
that
an
army
of
phantoms
vast
and
wan
beleaguer
the
human
soul
encamped
beside
life
rushing
stream
in
fancy
misty
light
gigantic
shapes
and
shadows
gleam
portentous
through
the
night
upon
its
midnight
battle
ground
the
spectral
camp
is
seen
and
with
a
sorrowful
deep
sound
flows
the
river
of
life
between
no
other
voice
nor
sound
is
there
in
the
army
of
the
grave
no
other
challenge
breaks
the
air
but
the
rushing
of
life
wave
and
when
the
solemn
and
deep
church
bell
entreats
the
soul
to
pray
the
midnight
phantoms
feel
the
spell
the
shadows
sweep
away
down
the
broad
vale
of
tears
afar
the
spectral
camp
is
fled

shineth
as
a
morning
star
our
ghastly
fears

awa
william
mickle
illustration
soldier
and
sailor
i
love
contemplating
apart
from
all
his
homicidal
glory
the
traits
that
soften
to
our
heart
napoleon
story
was
when
his
banners
at
boulogne
armed
in
our
island
every
freeman
his
navy
chanced
to
capture
one
poor
british
seaman
they
suffered
him
i
know
not
how
unprisoned
on
the
shore
to
roam
and
aye
was
bent
his
longing
brow
on
england
home
his
eye
methinks
pursued
the
flight
of
birds
to
britain
halfway
over
with
envy
could
reach
the
white
dear
cliffs
of
dover
a
stormy
midnight
watch
he
thought
than
this
sojourn
would
have
been
dearer
if
but
the
storm
his
vessel
brought
to
england
nearer
at
last
when
care
had
banished
sleep
he
saw
one
morning
dreaming
doating
an
empty
hogshead
from
the
deep
come
shoreward
floating
he
hid
it
in
a
cave
and
wrought
the
livelong
day
laborious
lurking
until
he
launched
a
tiny
boat
by
mighty
working
heaven
help
us
was
a
thing
beyond
description
wretched
such
a
wherry
perhaps
ventured
on
a
pond
or
crossed
a
ferry
for
plowing
in
the
salt
sea
field
it
would
have
made
the
boldest
shudder
untarred
uncompassed
and
unkeeled
no
sail
no
rudder
from
woods
he
interlaced
his
sorry
skiff
with
wattled
willows
and
thus
equipped
he
would
have
passed
the
foaming
billows
but
frenchmen
caught
him
on
the
beach
his
little
argo
sorely
jeering
till
tidings
of
him
chanced
to
reach
napoleon
hearing
with
folded
arms
napoleon
stood
serene
alike
in
peace
and
danger
and
in
his
wonted
attitude
addressed
the
stranger
rash
man
that
wouldst
yon
channel
pass
on
twigs
and
staves
so
rudely
fashioned
thy
heart
with
some
sweet
british
lass
must
be
impassioned
i
have
no
sweetheart
said
the
lad
but
absent
long
from
one
another
great
was
the
longing
that
i
had
to
see
my
mother
and
so
thou
shalt
napoleon
said
ye
both
my
favor
fairly
won
a
noble
mother
must
have
bred
so
brave
a
son
he
gave
the
tar
a
piece
of
gold
and
with
a
flag
of
truce
commanded
he
should
be
shipped
to
england
old
and
safely
landed
our
sailor
oft
could
scantly
shift
to
find
a
dinner
plain
and
hearty
but
changed
the
coin
and
gift
of
bonaparté
thomas
campbell
the
battle
of
blenheim
it
was
a
summer
evening
old
kaspar
work
was
done
and
he
before
his
cottage
door
was
sitting
in
the
sun
and
by
him
sported
on
the
green
his
little
grandchild
wilhelmine
she
saw
her
brother
peterkin
roll
something
large
and
round
which
he
beside
the
rivulet
in
playing
there
had
found
he
came
to
ask
what
he
had
found
that
was
so
large
and
smooth
and
round
old
kaspar
took
it
from
the
boy
who
stood
expectant
by
and
then
the
old
man
shook
his
head
and
with
a
natural
sigh
is
some
poor
fellow
skull
said
he
who
fell
in
the
great
victory
i
find
them
in
the
garden
for
there
many
here
about
and
often
when
i
go
to
plow
the
plowshare
turns
them
out
for
many
thousand
men
said
he
were
slain
in
that
great
victory
now
tell
us
what
was
all
about
young
peterkin
he
cries
and
little
wilhelmine
looks
up
with
eyes
now
tell
us
all
about
the
war
and
what
they
killed
each
other
for
it
was
the
english
kaspar
cried
who
put
the
french
to
rout
but
what
they
killed
each
other
for
i
could
not
well
make
out
but
everybody
said
quoth
he
that
was
a
famous
victory
my
father
lived
at
blenheim
then
yon
little
stream
hard
by
they
burned
his
dwelling
to
the
ground
and
he
was
forced
to
fly
so
with
his
wife
and
child
he
fled
nor
had
he
where
to
rest
his
head
with
fire
and
sword
the
country
round
was
wasted
far
and
wide
and
many
a
childing
mother
then
and
baby
died
but
things
like
that
you
know
must
be
at
every
famous
victory
they
say
it
was
a
shocking
sight
after
the
field
was
won
for
many
thousand
bodies
here
lay
rotting
in
the
sun
but
things
like
that
you
know
must
be
after
a
famous
victory
great
praise
the
duke
of
marlborough
won
and
our
good
prince
eugene
why
was
a
very
wicked
thing
said
little
wilhelmine
nay
nay
my
little
girl
quoth
he
it
was
a
famous
victory
and
everybody
praised
the
duke
who
this
great
fight
did
win
but
what
good
came
of
it
at
last
quoth
little
peterkin
why
that
i
can
not
tell
said
he
but
was
a
famous
victory
robert
southey
the
revenge
and
the
night
went
down
and
the
sun
smiled
out
far
over
the
summer
sea
and
the
spanish
fleet
with
broken
sides
lay
round
us
all
in
a
ring
but
they
dared
not
touch
us
again
for
they
feared
that
we
still
could
sting
so
they
watched
what
the
end
would
be
and
we
had
not
fought
them
in
vain
but
in
perilous
plight
were
we
seeing
forty
of
our
poor
hundred
were
slain
and
half
of
the
rest
of
us
maimed
for
life
in
the
crash
of
the
cannonades
and
the
desperate
strife
and
the
sick
men
down
in
the
hold
were
most
of
them
stark
and
cold
and
the
pikes
were
all
broken
or
bent
and
the
powder
was
all
of
it
spent
and
the
masts
and
the
rigging
were
lying
over
the
side
but
sir
richard
cried
in
his
english
pride
we
have
fought
such
a
fight
for
a
day
and
a
night
as
may
never
be
fought
again
we
have
won
great
glory
my
men
and
a
day
less
or
more
at
sea
or
ashore
we
die
does
it
matter
when
sink
me
the
ship
master
gunner
sink
her
split
her
in
twain
fall
into
the
hands
of
god
not
into
the
hands
of
spain
and
the
gunner
said
ay
ay
but
the
seamen
made
reply
we
have
children
we
have
wives
and
the
lord
hath
spared
our
lives
we
will
make
the
spaniard
promise
if
we
yield
to
let
us
go
we
shall
live
to
fight
again
and
to
strike
another
blow
and
the
lion
there
lay
dying
and
they
yielded
to
the
foe
and
the
stately
spanish
men
to
their
flagship
bore
him
then
where
they
laid
him
by
the
mast
old
sir
richard
caught
at
last
and
they
praised
him
to
his
face
with
their
courtly
foreign
grace
but
he
rose
upon
their
decks
and
he
cried
i
have
fought
for
queen
and
faith
like
a
valiant
man
and
true
i
have
only
done
my
duty
as
a
man
is
bound
to
do
with
a
joyful
spirit
i
sir
richard
grenville
die
and
he
fell
upon
their
decks
and
he
died
alfred
tennyson
the
revenge
hallowed
ground
what
hallowed
ground
has
earth
a
clod
its
maker
meant
not
should
be
trod
by
man
the
image
of
his
god
erect
and
free
unscourged
by
superstition
rod
to
bow
the
knee
that
hallowed
ground
where
mourned
and
missed
the
lips
repose
our
love
has
kissed
but
where
their
memory
mansion
yon
churchyard
bowers
no
in

their

ours
what
hallows
ground
where
heroes

piles
you
heap
in
dews
that
heavens
far
distant
weep
their
turf
may
bloom
or

twine
beneath
the
deep
their
coral
tomb
but
strew
his

to
the

lock

ride
october
up
from
the
south
at
break
of
day
bringing
to
winchester
fresh
dismay
the
affrighted
air
with
a
shudder
bore
like
a
herald
in
haste
to
the
chieftain
door
the
terrible
grumble
and
rumble
and
roar
telling
the
battle
was
on
once
more
and
sheridan
twenty
miles
away
and
wider
still
those
billows
of
war
thundered
along
the
horizon
bar
and
louder
yet
into
winchester
rolled
the
roar
of
that
red
sea
uncontrolled
making
the
blood
of
the
listener
cold
as
he
thought
of
the
stake
in
that
fiery
fray
and
sheridan
twenty
miles
away
but
there
is
a
road
from
winchester
town
a
good
broad
highway
leading
down
and
there
through
the
flash
of
the
morning
light
a
steed
as
black
as
the
steeds
of
night
was
seen
to
pass
as
with
eagle
flight
as
if
he
knew
the
terrible
need
he
stretched
away
with
the
utmost
speed
hills
rose
and
fell
but
his
heart
was
gay
with
sheridan
fifteen
miles
away
still
sprung
from
those
swift
hoofs
thundering
south
the
dust
like
smoke
from
the
cannon
mouth
on
the
tail
of
a
comet
sweeping
faster
and
faster
forboding
to
traitors
the
doom
of
disaster
the
heart
of
the
steed
and
the
heart
of
the
master
were
beating
like
prisoners
assaulting
their
walls
impatient
to
be
where
the
battlefield
calls
every
nerve
of
the
charger
was
strained
to
full
play
with
sheridan
only
ten
miles
away
under
his
spurning
feet
the
road
like
an
arrowy
alpine
river
flowed
and
the
landscape
flowed
away
behind
like
an
ocean
flying
before
the
wind
and
the
steed
like
a
bark
fed
with
furnace
ire
swept
on
with
his
wild
eyes
full
of
fire
but
lo
he
is
nearing
his
heart
desire
he
is
snuffing
the
smoke
of
the
roaring
fray
with
sheridan
only
five
miles
away
the
first
that
the
general
saw
were
the
groups
of
stragglers
and
then
the
retreating
troops
what
was
done
what
to
do
a
glance
told
him
both
then
striking
his
spurs
with
a
terrible
oath
he
dashed
down
the
lines
a
storm
of
huzzas
and
the
wave
of
retreat
checked
its
course
there
because
the
sight
of
the
master
compelled
it
to
pause
with
foam
and
with
dust
the
black
charger
was
gray
by
the
flash
of
his
eye
and
the
red
nostril
play
he
seemed
to
the
whole
great
army
to
say
i
brought
you
sheridan
all
the
way
from
winchester
down
to
save
the
day

hurrah

he

washed
in

for
you

go
down
or
ever
a

had
blown
for
you
did
not
see
the

rear
at

the

she
drave
at
the
rock
with
stern
sails
set
crash
went
the

in

she
staggered

mortal
blow

leaped
at

there
rose

and
strong
the
misty
moon
looked
out
and
the
water
swarmed
with
seamen
heads
and
the
wreck
was
strewed
about
i
saw
her
mainsail
lash
the
sea
as
i
clung
to
the
rock
alone
then
she
heeled
over
and
down
she
went
and
sank
like
any
stone
she
was
a
fair
ship
but
all
one
for
naught
could
bide
the

i

as

pillar
of

rose
far
away
and
shot
up

stately

reared

fell
over

i
am

but
for
your
rock
of
dark
renown
i
had
five
to
track

you
are
one
of

the
old
mayor
said
that
of
the
rock
complain
an
ill

mercer
your
words
ring
right
well
with
my
thoughts
they
chime
for
my

lend
me
a

of

free
for

think
to
raise

on

mayor
laughed
but
sighed
also
ah
youth
quoth
he
is
rash
sooner
young
man
root
it
out
from
the
sea
that
doth
it
lash
who
sails
too
near
its
jagged
teeth
he
shall
have
evil
lot
for
the
calmest
seas
that
tumble
there
froth
like
a
boiling
pot
and
the
heavier
seas
few
look
on
nigh
but
straight
they
lay
him
dead
a
sir
they
shoot
higher
than

masthead
oh

in

dark
they
are
right
welcome
things
and
pitch
pots
flaming
on
the
shore
show
fair
as
angel
wings
hast

in

then
light
the
land
it
to
thee
and
me
but
let
alone
the
deadly
rock
in
god
almighty
sea
yet
said
he
nay
i
must
away
on
the
rock
to
set
my
feet
my
debts
are
paid
my

i
made

die
by

if

oh
let

live
to

my

the
old

looked
him
in
the

and
answered
have
thy

thy
heart
is
stout
as
if
round
about
it
was

with
an

have
thy

choose
thy

put
off
from

god
with
thee

or
i
shall
see
thy

theirs
no

heavily
plunged
the
breaking
wave
and
foam
flew
up
the

morning
and
even
the
drifted

fell
into
the

sea
winstanley
chose
him
men
and

he
said
my
time
i
waste
for
the
seas
ran
seething
up
the
shore
and
the
wrack
drave
on
in
haste
but
twenty
days
he
waited
and
more
pacing
the
strand
alone
or
ever
he
sat
his
manly
foot
on
the
rock
the
eddystone
then
he
and
the
sea
began
their
strife
and
worked
with
power
and
might
whatever
the
man
reared
up
by
day
the
sea
broke
down
by
night
he
wrought
at
ebb
with
bar
and
beam
he
sailed
to
shore
at
flow
and
at
his
side
by
that
same
tide
came
bar

also
give

the
old

cried
or
thou
wilt
rue
the

yonder

goes
the
townsfolk
sighed
but
the
rock
will
have
its
way
for
all
his
looks
that
are
so
stout
and
his
speeches
brave
and
fair
he
may
wait
on
the
wind
wait
on
the
wave
but
he
build
no
lighthouse
there
in
fine
weather
and
foul
weather
the
rock
his
arts
did
flout
through
the
long
days
and
the

till
all
that
year
ran
out
with
fine

came

almost

now
march

came

a

settled
down

sailed

on

he
sailed
from
plymouth
town
with
men
and

he
put
to

as
he
was
wont
to
do
they
showed
in
the

like

full

a

lay

alway
for

eight

for

they
paced

in

dread
where
may
our

be

the
brooding

lay
soft
as
down
over
the

sea
a
scottish

made
the

the
thirteenth

at
as
i
am
a

the
captain
cried
a
strange
sight
i
have
seen
and
a
strange
sound
heard
my
masters
all
at
sea
in
the
fog
and
the
rain
like
shipwrights
hammers
tapping
low
then
loud
then
low

instant
showed
through

what

that

then
sighed
the

the

they
flocked
to
the

all
over
the

that

my

it

amid

away

as

just
one

bent

pricked
out
on

one

ever
that

at

and
horrible
heave

down

all
in

his

rolled
neck
and
croup
over
lay
dead
as
a
stone
and
there
was
my
roland
to
bear
the
whole
weight
of
the
news
which
alone
could
save

from

with

sat

no

from

on

adore
from

souls
that
entreat

in

prayer
from
the
hearts
that
are
broken
with
losses
and
weary
with
dragging
the
crosses
too
heavy
for

he
gathers
the
prayers
as
he
stands

they
change
into

a

the

haunts
me

me

throbbing

panting
with

among

majestic
is
standing
sandalphon
the
angel
expanding
his
pinions
in
nebulous
bars
and
the
legend

feel
is
a
part
of
the
hunger

the
