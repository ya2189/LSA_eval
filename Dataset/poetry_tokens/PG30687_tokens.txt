like

puritan
all
on

morning
i
took
my
love
to
church
to
see
if
parson
primrose
were
safely
on
his
perch
he
scarce
had
got
to
or
squire
begun
to
snore
when
like
a
a
green
and
crimson
a
frolic
of
madcap
came
whooping
through
the
door
come
up
come
in
with
streamers
come
in
with
boughs
of
may
come
up
and
thump
the
sexton
and
carry
the
clerk
away
now
skip
like
rams
ye
mountains
ye
little
hills
like
sheep
come
up
and
wake
the
people
that
parson
puts
to
sleep
they
tickled
their
tabors
their
garlands
flew
in
showers
and
lasses
and
lads
came
after
them
with
feet
like
dancing
flowers
their
queen
had
torn
her
green
gown
and
bared
a
shoulder
as
white
o
white
as
the
may
that
crowned
her
while
all
the
minstrels
round
her
tilted
back
their
crimson
hats
and
sang
for
sheer
delight
come
up
come
in
with
streamers
come
in
with
boughs
of
may
now
by
the
gold
upon
your
toe
you
walked

come
up

white
and
crimson
o
shake
your
bells
and
sing
let
the
porch
bend
the
pillars
bow
before
our
lord
the
spring
the
dusty
velvet
hassocks
were
dabbled
with
fragrant
dew
the
font
grew
white
with
hawthorn
it
frothed
in
every
pew
three
petals
clung
to
the
sexton
beard
as
he
mopped
and
mowed
at
the
clerk
and
take
that
sexton
away
they
cried
did
nebuchadnezzar
eat
may
they
cried
nay
that
was
a
prize
from
betty
they
cried
for
kissing

in

come
up
come

come
in
with

of

who
knows
but
old
methuselah
may
hobble

if
betty
could
kiss
the
sexton
if

could

the
clerk
who
knows
how
parson
primrose
might
blossom
in
the
dark
the
congregation
spluttered
the
squire
grew
purple
and
all
and
every
little
chorister
bestrode
his
carven
stall
the
parson
flapped
like
a
magpie
but
none
could
hear
his
prayers
for
tom
fool
flourished
his
tabor
flourished
his
tabor
bashed
the
head
of
the
sexton
and

pulpit
this
lord
of
all
misrule
i
think
it
was
will
summers
that
once
was
shakespeare
fool
held
up
his
hand
for
silence
and
all
the
church
grew
still
and
are
you
snoring
yet
he
said
or
have
you
slept
your
fill
your
god
still
walks
in
eden
between
the
ancient
trees
where
youth
and
love
go
wading
through
pools
of
primroses
and
this
is
the
sign
we
bring
you
before
the
darkness
fall
that
spring
is
risen
is
risen
again
that
life
is
risen
is
risen
again
that
love
is
risen
is
risen
again
and
love
is
lord
of
all
at
paske
began
our
morrice
and
ere
pentecost
our
may
because
albeit
your
words
be
true
you
know
not
what
you
say
you
chatter
in
church
like
jackdaws
words
that
would
wake
the
dead
were
there
one
breath
of
life
in
you
one
drop
of
blood
he
said
died
and
he
went
down
to
hell
you
know
not
what
you
mean
our
rafters
were
of
green
fir
also
our
beds
were
green
but
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
fool
a
fool
before
the
darkness
fall
we
tell
you
he
is
risen
again
the
lord
of
life
is
risen
again
the
boughs
put
forth
their
tender
buds
and
love
is
lord
of
all
he
bowed
his
head
he
stood
so
still
they
bowed
their
heads
as
well
and
softly
from
the
the
song
began
to
swell
up
with
the
reeds
began
the
strain
the
pealed
on
high
spring
is
risen
again
the
replied
shadows
flee
away
our
were
of
cedar
come
in
with
boughs
of
may
the
deepened
it
the
darkness
tell
you
he
is
risen
again
our
god
hath
burst
his
prison
again
christ
is
risen
is
risen
again
and
love
is
lord
of
the
repeal
i
dreamed
the
eternal
had
repealed
his
cosmic
code
of
law
last
night
our
prayers
had
made
the
unchanging
yield
caprice
was
king
from
depth
to
height
on
beachy
head
a
shouting
throng
had
fired
a
beacon
to
proclaim
their
licence
with
unmeasured
song
they
proved
it
dancing
in
the
flame
they
quarrelled
one
desired
the
sun
and
one
desired
the
stars
to
shine
they
closed
and
wrestled
and
burned
as
one
and
the
white
chalk
grew
red
as
wine
the
furnace
licked
and
purred
and
rolled
a
laughing
child
held
up
its
hands
like
dreadful
torches
dropping
gold
for
pain
was
dead
at
their
commands
painless
and
wild
as
clouds
they
burned
till
the
restricted
rose
of
day
with
all
its
glorious
laws
returned
and
the
wind
blew
their
ashes
away
the
political
morality
differs
from
individual
morality
because
there
is
no
power
above
the
state
shadow
by
shadow
stripped
for
fight
the
lean
black
cruisers
search
the
sea
their
level
shafts
of
light
revolve
and
find
no
enemy
only
they
know
each
leaping
wave
may
hide
the
lightning
and
their
grave
and
in
the
land
they
guard
so
well
is
there
no
silent
watch
to
keep
an
age
is
dying
and
the
bell
rings
midnight
on
a
vaster
deep
but
over
all
its
waves
once
more
the
move
from
shore
to
shore
and
captains
that
we
thought
were
dead
and
dreamers
that
we
thought
were
dumb
and
voices
that
we
thought
were
fled
arise
and
call
us
and
we
come
and
search
in
thine
own
soul
they
cry
for
there
too
lurks
thine
enemy
search
for
the
foe
in
thine
own
soul
the
sloth
the
intellectual
pride
the
trivial
jest
that
veils
the
goal
for
which
our
fathers
lived
and
died
the
lawless
dreams
the
cynic
art
that
rend
thy
nobler
self
apart
not
far
not
far
into
the
night
these
level
swords
of
light
can
pierce
yet
for
her
faith
does
england
fight
her
faith
in
this
our
universe
believing
truth
and
justice
draw
from
founts
of
everlasting
law
therefore
a
power
above
the
state
the
unconquerable
power
returns
the
fire
the
fire
that
made
her
great
once
more
upon
her
altar
burns
once
more
redeemed
and
healed
and
whole
she
moves
to
the
eternal
goal
forward
thousand
creeds
and
a
thousand
warring
social
schemes
a
thousand
new
moralities
and
twenty
thousand
thousand
dreams
on
his
own
anarchic
way
from
the
old
order
breaking
free
our
ruined
world
you
say
once
more
not
but
ah
beneath
the
struggling
foam
when
storm
and
change
are
on
the
deep
how
quietly
the
tides
come
home
and
how
the
depths
of
sleep
and
we
who
march
towards
a
goal
destroying
only
to
fulfil
the
law
the
law
of
that
great
soul
which
moves
beneath
your
alien
will
we
that
like
foemen
meet
the
past
because
we
bring
the
future
know
we
only
fight
to
achieve
at
last
a
great
with
our
foe
in
the
truths
that
stand
when
all
our
wars
are
rolled
away
of
the
heart
and
hand
and
of
the
prayers
wherewith
we
pray
in
the
common
needs
the
common
strivings
of
mankind
of
our
warring
creeds
in
the
one
god
that
dwells
behind
then
in
that
day
we
shall
not
meet
wrong
with
new
wrong
but
right
with
right
our
faith
shall
make
your
faith
complete
when
our
battalions
forward
what
use
in
idle
words
forward
o
warriors
of
the
soul
there
will
be
breaking
up
of
swords
when
that
new
morning
makes
us
whole
a

way
to
get
a
gather

your
left
hand

must
be
at

where
you
think

have
heard
that
it
is
best
if
you
gather
it
warm
and
sweet
out
of
the
dint
of
her
left
breast
where
you
see
her
heart
has
beat
of
the
dint
in
that
sweet
sand

forty
grains
i
say
yet
if
it
fail

understand
there
remains
a

of
this

melt
your
glass
while
the
veils
of

are
drawn
whispering
till

then
you
blow
your

up
and

slaughtered
at
the
break
of

while
the
cock
in
the
fairy
glen
thrusts
his
gold
neck
every
way
over
the
brambles
peering
calling
under
the
ferns
with
a
sudden
fear
far
and
wide
as
the

are
falling

calling
everywhere
the
crimson

and

wizened
child
of
seven
reeking
from
the
city
slime
out
of
hell
into
your
heaven
set
her
in

thyme
her
clothe
her
even
so
set
her
on
a
when
her
eyes
begin
to
glow
leave
her
for
an
hour
you
shall
need
no
spells
or
charms
on
that
in
that
dawn
when
she
lifts
her
wasted
arms
you
shall
see
a
veil
withdrawn
there
shall
be
no
veil
between
them
though
her
head
be
old
and
wise
you
shall
know
that
she
has
seen
them
by
the
glory
in
her
eyes
her
irons
on
that
hill
earth
has
tossed
a
fairy
fire
watch
and
listen
and
be
still
lest
you
baulk
your
own
when
she
sees
four
azure
wings
light
upon
her
hand
when
she
lifts
her
head
and
sings
you
shall
hear
and
understand
you
shall
hear
a
bugle
calling
wildly
over
the
down
and
a
sound
as
of
the
falling
ramparts
of
a
conquered
town
shall
hear
a
sound
like
thunder
and
a
veil
shall
be
withdrawn
when
her
eyes
grow
wide
with
wonder
on
that
in
that
crimson
sails
salomon
sailed
from

that

a
peacock
butterfly
flaunted
its
four
great
crimson
wings
as
over
the
edge
of

it
flew
black
as

ship
on

brought
as

honey
and
spice
to
the
queen
of

south

or
saba
a
song
for
her
mouth

over

the
tall
white
cliffs
that
the
wild
thyme
crowns
a
song
that
the
whole
sky
sings
when
salomon
sailed
from
ophir
with
olliphants
and
gold
the
kings
went
up
the
kings
went
down
trying
to
match
king
salomon
crown
but
salomon
sacked
the
sunset
wherever
his
black
ships
rolled
he
rolled
it
up
like

crammed
it
into

salomon

he
rolled
it
up
like

crammed
it
into
his
hold
his
masts
were
lebanon
cedars
his
sheets
were
singing
blue
but
that
was
never
the
reason
why
he
stuffed
his
hold
with
the
sunset
sky
the
kings
could
cut
their
cedars
and
sail
from
ophir
too
but
salomon
packed
his
heart
with
dreams
and
all
the
dreams
were
true
the
kings
could
cut
their
cedars
cut
their
lebanon
cedars
but
salomon
packed
his

and
all
the

were
true
when

ophir
he
sailed
not
as

they
weltered

tawny

all

of

grew

their

sheets
grew

their

grew
sweeter
for
salomon
tawny
seamen
sirs

with

sails
so
tall
the
kings
went
up
the
kings
went
down
trying
to
match
king

crown
but
salomon
brought
the
sunset
to
hang
on
his
temple
wall
he
rolled
it
up
like

cloth
so
his
was
better

him
not

long
red
feather
he
wore
a
long
coat
of
the
kind
and
darned
white
hosen
with

patch
behind
so
one
night
he
shuffled
past
in
his
buckled
shoon
we
shall
never
see
his
face
twisted
to

queer
grimace
waiting
in
the
wind
and
rain
till
we
called
his
tune
very
whimsical
and
white
waiting
on

blue
twelfth
night
he
is
grown

springs
and

in

them
into

mind
old
blind
moone
of
london
o
now
his
songs
are
done
the
light
upon
his
lost
white
face
they
say
it
was
the
sun
the
light
upon
his
poor
old
face
they
say
it
was
the
sun
old
grey
squirrel
a
great
while
ago
there
was
a
he
lived
in
a
cottage
by
the
sea
and
the
very
first
thing
he
could
remember
was
the
rigging
of
the
schooners
by
the
quay
he
could
watch
them
when
he
woke
from
his
window
with
the
tall
cranes
hoisting
out
the
freight
and
he
used
to
think
of
shipping
as
a
and
sailing
to
the
golden
gate
for
he
used
to
buy
the
yellow
penny
dreadfuls
and
read
them
where
he
fished
for
conger
eels
and
listened
to
the
lapping
of
the
water
the
green
and
oily
water
round
the
keels
there
were
trawlers
with
their
and
red
nets
hanging
out
to
dry
and
the
skate
the
skipper
kept
because
he
liked
and
landsmen
never
knew
the
fish
to
fry
there
were
brigantines
with
timber
out
of
norroway
oozing
with
the
syrups
of
the
pine
there
were
rusty
dusty
schooners
out
of
sunderland
and
ships
of
the
blue
cross
line
and
to
tumble
down
a
hatch
into
the
cabin
was
better
than
the
best
of
broken
rules
for
the
smell
of
was
like
a
christmas
dinner
and
the
feel
of
was
like
a
box
of
tools
and
before
he
went
to
sleep
in
the
evening
the
very
last
thing
that
he
could
see
was
the
in
the
moonlight
by
the
capstan
that
stood
upon
the
quay
is
perched
upon
a
high
stool
in
london
the
golden
gate
is
very
far
away
they
caught
him
and
they
caged
him
like
a
squirrel
he
is
totting
up
accounts
and
going
will
never
never
never
sail
to
but
the
very
last
thing
that
he
will
see
will
be
in
the
sunrise
by
the
capstan
that
stands
upon
the
quay
the
tune
of
an
old
concertina
by
the
capstan
that
stands
upon
the
the
great
north
road
just
as
the
moon
was
rising
i
met
a
ghostly
pedlar
singing
for
company
beneath
his
ghostly
load
once
there
were
velvet
lads
with
vizards
on
their
faces
riding
up
to
rob
me
on
the
great
north
road
now
my
pack
is
heavy
and
my
pocket
full
of
guineas
chimes
like
a
but
little
i
enjoy
roads
that
never
echo
to
the
chirrup
of
their
canter
the
gay
golden
farmer
and
the
hereford
boy
rogues
were
they
all
but
their
raid
was
from
shod
with
elfin
silver
were
the
steeds
they
bestrode
merlin
buckled
on
the
spurs
that
wheeled
thro
the
wet
fern
bright
as
off
the
great
north
road
tales
were
told
in
country
inns
when
turpin
rode
to
rippleside
puck
tuned
the
and
country
maids
grew
coy
tavern
doors
grew
magical
when
colonel
jack
might
tap
at
them
the
gay
golden
farmer
and
the
hereford
boy
what
are
you
seeking
then
i
asked
this
honest
pedlar
o

or
natty

ease
me
of
my
load
where
are
they
flown
then

where
i

gone
for
ever

the
river
of
stars
tale
of
lights
of
a
hundred
cities
are
fed
by
its
midnight
power
their
wheels
are
moved
by
its
thunder
but
they
too
have
their
hour
the
tale
of
the
indian
lovers
a
cry
from
the
years
that
are
flown
while
the
river
of
stars
is
rolling
rolling
away
to
the
darkness
abides
with
the
power
in
the
midnight
where
love
may
find
its
she
watched
from
the
huron
tents
till
the
first
star
shook
in
the
air
the
sweet
pine
scented
her
and
breathed
from
her
braided
hair
her
crown
was
of
because
of
the
tryst
she
would
keep
beyond
the
river
of
beauty
that
drifted
away
in
the
darkness
drawing
the
sunset
thro
lilies
with
eyes
like
stars
to
the
deep
he
watched
like
a
tall
young
from
the
red
pine
that
she
named
but
not
for
the
peril
behind
him
where
the
eyes
of
the
mohawks
flamed
he
stood
but
his
heart
was
hunting
afar
where
the
river
of
longing
whispered
and
one
swift
shaft
from
the
darkness
felled
him
her
name
in
his
his
eyes
on
the
sunset
star
she
stole
from
the
river
and
listened
the
moon
on
her
wet
skin
shone
as
a
silver
birch
in
a
her
beauty
flashed
and
was
gone
there
was
no
wave
in
the
forest
the
dark
arms
closed
her
round
but
the
river
of
life
went
flowing
flowing
away
to
the
darkness
for
her
breast
grew
red
with
his
heart
blood
in
a
night
where
the
stars
are
drowned
me
o
my
lover
as
you
taught
me
of
love
in
a
day
teach
me
of
death
and
for
ever
and
set
my
feet
on
the
way
to
the
land
of
the
happy
shadows
the
land
where
you
are
and
the
river
of
death
went
weeping
weeping
away
to
the
the
hunting
good
my
lover
so
good
that
you
hunt
alone
she
rose
to
her
feet
like
a
shadow
she
sent
a
cry
thro
the
night
the
that
tells
of
triumph
in
fight
it
broke
from
the
bell
of
her
mouth
like
the
cry
of
a
wounded
bird
but
the
river
of
agony
swelled
it
and
swept
it
along
to
the
darkness
and
the
mohawks
couched
in
the
darkness
leapt
to
their
feet
as
they
heard
close
as
the
ring
of
the
clouds
that
menace
the
moon
with
death
at
once
they
circled
her
round
her
bright
breast
panted
for
breath
with
only
her
own
wild
glory
keeping
the
wolves
at
bay
while
the
river
of
parting
whispered
whispered
away
to
the
darkness
she
looked
in
their
eyes
for
a
moment
and
strove
for
a
word
to
say
me
o
my
lover
she
set
her
foot
on
the
dead
she
laughed
on
the
painted
faces
with
their
rings
of
yellow
and
red
thank
you
wolves
of
the
mohawk
for
a
woman
hands
might
and
the
river
of
vengeance
chuckled
chuckled
away
to
the
darkness
ye
have
killed
where
i
hunted
i
have
come
to
the
end
of
my
thank
you
braves
of
the
mohawk
who
laid
this
thief
at
my
feet
he
tore
my
heart
out
living
and
tossed
it
his
dogs
to
eat
ye
have
taught
him
of
death
in
a
moment
as
he
taught
me
of
love
in
a
and
the
river
of
passion
deepened
deepened
and
rushed
to
the
yet
may
a
woman
requite
you
and
set
your
feet
on
the
the
woman
that
spits
in
my
face
and
the
shaven
heads
that
gibe
this
night
shall
a
woman
show
you
the
tents
of
the
huron
tribe
they
are
lodged
in
a
deep
valley
with
all
things
good
it
abounds
where
the
river
glides
like
a
snake
to
the
darkness
i
will
show
you
a
valley
mohawks
like
the
happy
hunting
they
chuckled
and
followed
like
wolves
to
the
glittering
stream
shadows
obeying
a
shadow
they
launched
their
canoes
in
a
dream
alone
in
the
first
with
the
blood
on
her
breast
and
her
crown
she
stood
she
smiled
at
them
then
urged
her
canoe
to
the
darkness
and
silently
flashing
their
paddles
the
mohawks
followed
her
down
and
now
as
they
slid
thro
the
with
their
peaks
of
midnight
blue
she
heard
in
the
broadening
distance
the
deep
sound
that
she
knew
a
mutter
of
steady
thunder
that
grew
as
they
glanced
along
but
ever
she
glanced
before
them
and
glanced
away
to
the
darkness
and
or
ever
they
heard
it
rightly
she
raised
her
voice
in
a
song
wind
from
the
isles
of
the
blesséd
it
blows
across
the
foam
it
sings
in
the
flowing
maples
of
the
land
that
was
my
home
where
the
moose
is
a
morning
hunt
and
the
buffalo
feeds
from
the
and
the
river
of
mockery
broadened
broadened
and
rolled
to
the
darkness
the
green
maize
lifts
its
feathers
and
laughs
the
snow
from
the
the
river
broadened
and
quickened
there
was
nought
but
river
and
sky
the
shores
were
lost
in
the
darkness
she
laughed
and
lifted
a
cry
me
swifter
and
swifter
they
swirled
and
the
flood
of
their
doom
went
flying
flying
away
to
the
darkness
me
follow
me
mohawks
ye
are
shooting
the
edge
of
the
they
struggled
like
snakes
to
return
like
straws
they
were
whirled
on
her
track
for
the
whole
flood
swooped
to
that
edge
where
the
unplumbed
night
dropt
black
the
whole
flood
dropt
to
a
thunder
in
an
unplumbed
hell
beneath
and
over
the
gulf
of
the
thunder
a
mountain
of
spray
from
the
darkness
rose
and
stood
in
the
heavens
like
a
shrouded
image
of
death
she
rushed
like
a
star
before
them
the
moon
on
her
glorying
shone
me
o
my
her
cry
flashed
out
and
was
gone
a
moment
they
battled
behind
her
they
lashed
with
their
paddles
and
lunged
then
the
mohawks
turning
their
faces
like
a
cloud
to
the
darkness
over
the
edge
of
niagara
swept
together
and
plunged
the
lights
of
a
hundred
cities
are
fed
by
the
ancient
power
but
a
cry
returns
with
the
midnight
for
they
too
have
their
hour
teach
me
o
my
lover
as
you
taught
me
of
love
in
a
day
while
the
river
of
stars
is
rolling
rolling
away
to
the
darkness
teach
me
of
death
and
for
ever
and
set
my
feet
on
the
way
a
knight
of
old
japan
make
me
a
stave
of
song
the
master
said
on
yonder
whose
white
and
red
hangs
in
the
sunset
over
those
green
seas
the
young
knight
looked
upon
his
untried
blade
then
shrugged
his
wings
of
gold
and
blue
brocade
should
a
warrior
play
with
thoughts
like
these
fresh
from
the
battle
in
that
hour
a
warrior
watched
each
delicate
flower
close
in
that
cloud
of
beauty
against
the
west
drinking
the
last
deep
light
he
watched
it
long
he
raised
his
face
as
if
to
pray
the
master
whispered
the
beyond
death
i
in
lonely
bays
where
love
runs
wild
all
among
the
flowering
grasses
where
light
light
light
as
a
wing
the
chuckle
of
the
passes
o
to
awake
to
shake
away
the
night
and
find
you
dreaming
there
on
the
other
side
of
death
with
the
blowing
round
you
and
the
scent
of
the
thyme
in
your
hair
ii
tho
beauty
perish
perish
like
a
flower
and
song
be
an
idle
breath
tho
heaven
be
a
dream
and
youth
for
but
an
hour
and
life
much
less
than
death
and
the
maker
less
than
that
he
made
and
hope
less
than
despair
if
death
have
shores
where
love
runs
wild
i
think
you
might
be
there
iii
from
the
splendid
sea
there
should
you
awake
and
sing
with
every
supple
sweet
from
the
head
to
the
feet
modelled
like
a
wing
o
to
awake
to
shake
away
the
night
and
find
you
happy
there
on
the
other
side
of
death
with
the
blowing
round
you
and
the
scent
of
the
thyme
in
your
hair
the
strange
guest
you
can
not
leave
a
new
house
with
any
open
door
but
a
strange
guest
will
enter
it
and
never
leave
it
more
build
it
on
a
waste
land
dreary
as
a
sin
leave
her
but
a
broken
gate
and
beauty
will
come
in
build
it
all
of
scarlet
brick
work
your
wicked
will
dump
it
on
an
then
o
then
be
still
sit
and
watch
your
new
house
leave
an
open
door
a
strange
guest
will
enter
it
and
never
leave
it
more
she
will
make
your
raw
wood
mellower
than
gold
she
will
take
your
new
lamps
and
sell
them
for
old
she
will
crumble
all
your
pride
break
your
folly
down
much
that
you
rejected
she
will
bless
and
crown
she
will
rust
your
naked
roof
split
your
pavement
through
dip
her
brush
in
sun
and
moon
and
colour
it
anew
leave
her
but
a
window
wide
to
wind
and
rain
you
shall
find
her
footsteps
when
you
come
again
though
she
keep
you
waiting
many
months
or
years
she
shall
stain
and
make
it
beautiful
with
tears
she
shall
hurt
and
heal
it
soften
it
and
save
blessing
it
until
it
stand
stronger
than
the
grave
can
not
leave
a
new
house
with
any
open
door
but
a
strange
guest
will
enter
it
and
never
leave
it
ghosts
o
to
creep
in
by
when
all
the
world
is
fast
asleep
out
of
the
cold
winds
out
of
the
night
where
the
nettles
wave
and
the
rains
weep
o
to
creep
in
lifting
the
latch
so
quietly
that
no
soul
could
hear
and
at
those
embers
in
the
gloom
quietly
light
one
careful
match
you
should
not
hear
it
have
no
fear
and
light
the
candle
and
look
round
the
old
familiar
room
to
see
the
old
books
upon
the
wall
and
lovingly
take
one
down
again
and
hear
o
strange
to
those
that
lay
so
patiently
underground
the
ticking
of
the
clock
the
sound
of
clicking
embers
watch
the
play
of
shadows
till
the
implacable
call
of
morning
turn
our
faces
grey
and
or
ever
we
go
we
lift
and
kiss
some
idle
thing
that
your
hands
may
touch
some
paper
or
book
that
your
hands
let
fall
and
we
never
when
living
had
cared
so
much
as
to
glance
upon
twice
but
now
o
bliss
to
kiss
and
to
cherish
it
moaning
our
pain
ere
we
creep
to
the
silence
again
the
day
of
remembrance
dazzle
of
the
sea
azure
of
the
sky
glitter
of
the
dew
on
the
grass
pass
to
oblivion
in
the
darkness
with
all
that
ever
is
or
ever
was
yet
o
flocks
of
cloud
with
your
violet
shadows
o
white
may
crowding
the
lane
the
shepherd
that
drives
you
to
the
darkness
shall
lead
you
thro
the
crimson
dawn
again
bear
your
load
of
beauty
to
the
sunset
and
the
golden
gates
of
death
the
eternal
shall
remember
in
the
darkness
and
recall
you
at
a
word
at
a
breath
even
as
the
mind
of
a
man
may
remember
his
lost
and
linkless
hours
this
world
that
is
scattered
to
the
darkness
dismembered
and
clouds
and
flowers
cities
suns
and
systems
as
he
said
of
old
they
sleep
not
a
bird
not
a
leaf
shall
pass
by
but
on
the
day
of
remembrance
in
the
darkness
in
a
moment
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
they
shall
flash
to
their
places
in
the
music
of
the
whole
even
as
our
fathers
said
for
a
power
shall
remember
in
the
darkness
and
the
universal
sea
give
up
her
dead
on
the
embankment
within
it
was
colour
and
laughter
warmth
and
wine
without
it
was
darkness
hunger
and
bitter
cold
where
those
white
globes
on
the
wet
embankment
shine
greasing
the
thames
with
gold
and
was
it
a
bundle
of
fog
in
the
dark
drew
nigh
a
bundle
of
rags
and
bones
it
crept
to
the
light
a
monstrous
thing
that
coughed
as
it
shuffled
by
a
shape
of
the
shapeless
night
spawned
as
brown
things
that
mimic
their
mothering
earth
green
creeping
things
that
the
grass
lifts
to
the
sun
out
of
its
wrongs
the
city
had
brought
to
the
birth
the
shape
of
those
wrongs
in
one
a
woman
a
woman
whose
lips
had
once
been
kissed
it
was
christmas
eve
and
the
bells
began
their
chime
she
sank
to
a
seat
like
a
coughing
bundle
of
mist
exhaled
from
the
for
the
birth
of
christ
she
heard
and
she
thought
vacantly
of
her
man
that
was
long
since
dead
the
smell
of
the
christmas
food
and
the
drink
they
had
bought
together
the
year
they
were
she
thought
of
their
home
and
the
sigh
recalled
as
he
slept
of
his
breath
in
her
loosened
hair
she
opened
her
haggard
eyes
with
a
cry
but
only
the
night
was
there
nay
out
of
the
formless
night
at
her
furtive
glance
crouched
at
the
end
of
her
cold
wet
bench
there
grew
a
bundle
of
fog
a
bundle
of
rags
that
perchance
once
was
a
woman
too
a
huddled
shape
a
fungus
of
foul
grey
mist
spawned
of
the
river
in
peace
and
much
and
even
the
woman
whose
lips
had
once
been
kissed
wondered
it
crouched
so
still
no
breath
no
shadow
of
breath
in
the
smoked
it
crouched
so
still
that
bunch
at
the
bench
end
she
stretched
her
neck
like
a
crow
then
leaned
and
croaked
merry
christmas
friend
she
rose
and
peered
peered
at
its
vacant
eyes
touched
its
cold
claws
its
arms
of
knotted
bone
were
wands
of
ice
like
iron
rods
the
thighs
the
left
breast
like
a
stone
far
along
the
rows
of
warmth
and
light
the
christmas
waits
with
cornet
and
bassoon
carolled
while
shepherds
watched
their
flocks
by
night
the
bells
pealed
to
the
a
bundle
of
rags
and
bones
a
bundle
of
mist
and
never
a
hell
or
heaven
to
hear
or
see
the
woman
the
woman
whose
lips
had
once
been
kissed
knelt
down
feverishly
she
plucked
the
shawl
out
of
that
frozen
clutch
the
dead
are
dead
why
should
the
living
freeze
she
touched
the
cold
flesh
that
she
feared
to
touch
kneeling
upon
her
knees
her
palsied
hands
unlaced
the
shoes
good
shoes
she
tore
them
quick
from
the
crooked
yellow
feet
if
death
be
generous
why
should
life
refuse
to
take
and
pawn
and
eat
a
heavy
step
drew
nearer
thro
the
mist
she
bundled
them
into
the
shawl
her
eyes
were
bright
the
woman
the
woman
whose
lips
had
once
been
kissed
slunk
chuckling
thro
the
night
the
iron
crown
not
memory
of
a
vanished
bliss
but
suddenly
to
know
i
had
forgotten
this
o
this
with
iron
crowned
my
woe
to
know
that
on
some
midnight
sea
whence
none
could
lift
the
pall
a
drowning
hand
was
waved
to
me
then
swept
beyond
recall
the
old
debate
his
angels
fell
and
myriads
grope
in
doubt
for
this
dark
cause
alone
that
god
hath
given
them
room
for
hope
and
made
their
struggling
wills
their
own
in
the
same
breath
they
plead
for
chains
and
freedom
pray
for
ordered
spheres
then
murmur
that
the
sun
retains
its
course
unchecked
by
smiles
or
tears
the
omnipotent
would
grant
us
this
or
else
he
is
not
good
they
say
but
o
the
power
withholds
their
bliss
till
they
agree
what
prayer
to
pray
a
song
of
hope
not
in
those
eyes
too
kind
for
truth
which
dare
not
note
how
beauties
wane
nor
in
that
crueller
joy
of
youth
which
turns
from
sorrow
with
disdain
no
no
not
there
abides
the
hope
that
answers
our
despair
lie
where
they
hid
thy
dead
away
knock
on
that
unrelenting
door
then
break
o
desolate
heart
and
say
farewell
farewell
for
evermore
there
only
there
abides
the
hope
that
conquers
all
despair
the
silence
that
refused
to
bless
till
grief
had
turned
the
heart
to
stone
what
soul
compact
of
nothingness
could
hear
so
fierce
a
trumpet
blown
then
hear
o
hear
the
dreadful
hope
that
equals
all
despair
there
till
the
deep
atoning
might
shall
answer
all
that
each
can
pray
the
very
boundlessness
of
night
proclaims
and
waits
an
equal
day
there
only
there
o
sing
low
sweet
strings
lest
hope
take
wing
abides
the
hope
that
answers
all
despair
the
opens
how
passionately
it
opens
after
rain
and
o
how
like
a
prayer
to
those
great
shining
skies
do
they
disdain
a
bride
so
small
and
fair
see
the
imploring
petals
how
they
part
and
utterly
lay
bare
the
perishing
treasures
of
that
piteous
heart
in
wild
surrender
there
what
too
drink
up
the
eternal
bliss
ecstatically
dare
o
little
bride
of
god
to
invoke
kiss
but
o
how
like
a
prayer
the
the
on
the
hill
stands
in
the
night
so
fragrant
and
so
still
so
dusky
white
that
stealing
from
the
wood
in
that
sweet
air
you
think
diana
stood
before
you
there
if
it
be
so
her
bloom
trembles
with
bliss
she
waits
across
the
gloom
her
shepherd
kiss
touch
her
a
bird
will
start
from
those
pure
snows
the
dark
and
fluttering
heart
endymion
knows
old
letters
read
them
strangle
that
sick
cry
christ
god
no
shut
the
box
lock
the
lid
you
be
safer
so
could
you
read
one
crookéd
word
scrawled
so
long
ago
love
would
rise
before
your
face
and
blind
you
like
a
blow
it
quickly
for
i
caught
in
a
childish
hand
something
that
she
never
thought
i
should
so
i
crouch
and
shall
our
god
prove
him
baser
yet
he
who
filled
her
eyes
with
light
quite
renounce
his
debt
give
her
worlds
to
love
and
then
ere
the
sun
be
set
strike
her
down
and
coffin
all
christ
shall
forget
it
quickly
for
i
caught
in
a
childish
hand
something
that
she
never
thought
i
should
lamps
immense
and
silent
night
over
the
lonely
downs
i
go
and
the
deep
gloom
is
pricked
with
points
of
light
above
me
and
below
i
can
not
break
the
bars
of
time
and
fate
and
if
i
scan
the
sky
there
comes
to
me
questioning
those
cold
stars
no
signal
no
reply
yet
are
they
less
than
these
these
which
i
do
scan
below
me
or
far
out
on
darkling
seas
those
messages
from
man
round
me
the
darkness
rolls
out
of
the
depth
each
lance
of
light
shoots
from
lost
lanthorns
thrills
from
living
souls
and
shall
i
doubt
the
height
no
signal
no
reply
as
through
the
deepening
night
i
roam
hope
opens
all
her
casements
in
the
sky
and
lights
the
lamps
of
home
at
eden
gates
eden
so
the
said
i
could
not
see
the
road
but
where
the
sussex
clover
blossomed
red
its
runaway
blisses
flowed
i
traced
them
back
for
many
a
night
and
day
the
way
she
too
had
gone
till
lo
the
terrible
angel
in
the
way
inexorably
shone
up
to
the
gates
a
fearless
fool
i
came
between
the
lily
and
rose
fluttering
these
evil
rags
of
sordid
shame
a
thing
to
scare
the
crows
and
hath
the
master
given
thee
then
no
word
the
scornful
angel
smiled
only
two
souls
may
pass
my
flaming
sword
the
lover
and
the
child
i
raised
my
head
now
let
all
hell
make
mirth
where
love
went
i
go
too
his
eyes
met
mine
the
sword
sank
to
the
earth
and
let
her
lover
through
the
psyche
of
our
day
as
constant
lovers
may
rejoice
with
seas
between
with
worlds
between
because
a
fragrance
and
a
voice
are
round
them
everywhere
so
let
me
travel
to
the
grave
believing
still
for
i
have
seen
that
love
triumphant
banners
wave
beyond
my
own
despair
i
have
no
trust
in
my
own
worth
yet
have
i
faith
o
love
for
you
that
every
beauty
in
bloom
or
leaf
that
even
age
and
wrong
may
touch
may
hurt
you
on
this
earth
but
only
only
as
kisses
do
or
as
the
fretted
string
of
grief
completes
the
bliss
of
song
that
you
shall
see
on
any
grave
the
snow
fall
like
that
unseen
hand
which
o
so
often
pressed
your
hair
to
cherish
and
console
that
seas
may
roar
and
winds
rave
but
you
shall
feel
and
understand
what
vast
caresses
everywhere
convey
you
to
the
goal
so
was
it
always
in
the
years
when
love
began
when
love
began
with
eyes
that
were
not
touched
of
tears
and
lips
that
still
could
sing
and
all
around
us
in
the
may
the
with
his
laughter
ran
and
every
bloom
on
every
spray
betrayed
his
fluttering
wing
so
hold
it
keep
it
count
it
sweet
until
the
end
until
the
end
it
is
not
cruelty
but
bliss
that
pains
and
is
so
fond
crush
life
like
thyme
beneath
your
feet
and
o
my
love
when
that
strange
friend
the
shadow
of
wings
which
men
call
death
shall
close
your
eyes
with
that
last
kiss
ask
not
his
name
a
rosier
breath
shall
waken
you
beyond
paraclete
tongue
hath
not
told
it
heart
hath
not
known
yet
shall
the
bough
swing
when
it
hath
flown
dreams
have
denied
it
fools
forsworn
yet
it
hath
comforted
each
man
born
once
and
again
it
is
blown
to
me
sweet
from
the
wild
thyme
salt
from
the
sea
blown
thro
the
ferns
faint
from
the
sky
shadowed
in
water
yet
clear
as
a
cry
light
on
a
face
or
touch
of
a
hand
making
my
still
heart
understand
earth
hath
not
seen
it
nor
heaven
above
yet
shall
the
wild
bough
bend
with
the
dove
yea
tho
the
bloom
fall
under
thy
feet
creator
paraclete
after
rain
listen
on
sweetening
air
the
blackbird
growing
bold
flings
out
where
green
boughs
glisten
three
splashes
of
wild
gold
daughter
of
april
hear
and
hear
o
barefoot
boy
that
carol
of
wild
sweet
water
has
washed
the
world
with
joy
glisten
o
fragrant
earth
assoiled
by
heaven
anew
and
o
ye
lovers
listen
with
eyes
that
glisten
too
the
death
of
a
great
man
no
not
that
he
is
dead
the
pang
not
there
nor
in
the
city
bloom
of
swift
posters
which
the
throng
passes
with
bovine
stare
to
say
is
and
it
going
to
rain
or
hum
stray
snatches
of
a
song
nor
is
it
in
that
falsest
shibboleth
which
orators
toss
to
the
dumb
scorn
of
death
that
all
the
world
stands
weeping
at
his
tomb
london
is
dining
dancing
through
it
all
and
in
the
unchecked
smiles
along
the
street
where
men
that
slightly
knew
him
lightly
meet
with
all
the
old
indifferent
grimaces
there
is
no
jot
of
grief
no
tittle
of
pain
no
no
for
nearer
things
do
most
tears
fall
grief
is
for
near
and
little
things
but
pride
o
pride
was
to
be
found
by
two
or
three
and
glory
in
his
great
battling
memory
prouder
and
purer
than
the
loud
world
knows
in
one
more
dreadful
sign
the
day
he
died
the
dreadful
light
upon
a
thousand
faces
the
peace
upon
the
faces
of
his
foes
the
roman
way
he
that
has
loyally
served
the
state
whereof
he
found
himself
a
part
or
spent
his
to
create
a
kingdom
treasure
in
his
art
who
sees
the
enemies
of
his
land
applauded
by
her
sects
and
schools
and
the
high
thought
they
scarce
had
scanned
derided
and
befogged
by
fools
better
to
know
it
soon
than
late
struggling
he
wins
a
meed
of
praise
achieving
he
is
dogged
by
hate
and
furtive
malice
all
his
days
o
emperor
of
the
stoic
clan
enfold
him
then
with
nobler
pride
teach
him
that
nought
can
hurt
a
man
who
will
not
turn
or
stoop
to
chide
can
falsehood
kindle
or
bedim
one
in
his
quiet
crown
ten
thousand
lies
may
pluck
at
him
but
only
truth
can
tear
him
down
why
should
he
heed
the
thing
they
say
they
never
asked
if
it
were
true
why
brush
one
scribbler
tale
away
for
others
to
invent
a
new
no
let
him
search
his
heart
secure
if
truth
be
there
from
tongue
or
pen
and
teach
us
emperor
to
endure
to
think
like
romans
and
like
men
the
inner
passion
there
is
a
master
in
my
heart
to
whom
though
oft
against
my
will
i
bring
the
songs
i
sing
apart
and
strive
to
think
that
they
fulfil
his
silent
law
within
my
heart
but
he
is
blind
to
my
desires
and
deaf
to
all
that
i
would
plead
he
tests
my
truth
at
purer
fires
and
shames
my
purple
with
his
need
he
claims
my
deeds
not
my
desires
and
often
when
my
comrades
praise
i
sadden
for
he
turns
from
me
but
sometimes
when
they
blame
i
raise
mine
eyes
to
his
and
in
them
see
a
tenderness
too
deep
for
praise
he
is
not
to
be
bought
with
gold
or
lured
by
thornless
crowns
of
fame
but
when
some
rebel
thought
hath
sold
him
to
dishonour
and
to
shame
and
my
heart
pilate
cries
behold
behold
the
man
i
know
him
then
and
all
those
wild
thronged
clamours
die
in
my
heart
judgment
hall
again
or
if
it
ring
with
crucify
some
few
are
faithful
even
then
some
few
sad
thoughts
one
bears
his
cross
to
that
dark
calvary
of
my
pride
one
stands
far
off
and
mourns
his
loss
and
one
poor
thief
on
either
side
hangs
on
his
own
unworthy
cross
and
one
o
truth
in
ancient
guise
rails
and
one
bids
him
cease
alway
and
the
god
turns
his
hungering
eyes
on
that
poor
thought
with
thou
this
day
shalt
sing
shalt
sing
in
paradise
a
country
lane
in
heaven
the
exceeding
weight
of
glory
bowed
my
head
in
that
pure
clime
i
found
a
road
that
ran
through
cloud
along
the
coasts
of
time
out
of
that
mist
of
years
there
came
a
gate
of
wood
i
clutched
i
kissed
the
unheavenly
frame
so
hard
it
trickled
blood
my
head
upon
the
iron
lay
i
slobbered
blood
and
foam
yea
like
a
dog
i
knew
the
way
a
hundred
yards
from
home
and
blood
and
wood
they
knew
the
secret
of
that
cry
when
the
eternal
passion
drew
their
maker
through
to
i
knew
each
little
along
my
misty
lane
then
my
heart
burst
she
sobbed
aloud
between
my
arms
again
to
the
destroyers
yes
you
have
shattered
many
an
ancient
wrong
and
we
were
with
you
heart
and
mind
and
soul
but
there
are
fools
who
cast
away
control
in
life
and
thought
and
art
because
the
strong
we
dare
to
say
it
have
now
destroyed
so
long
that
careless
minds
forget
the
unchanging
goal
the
nobler
order
which
shall
make
us
whole
the
service
which
is
freedom
beauty
song
we
shall
be
stoned
as
traitors
to
your
cause
while
the
real
traitors
that

crowned
with

violets

was

her
breaking
off
the
horns
of
the
sweetly
dripped
the
dew
upon

small
white
feet

must

garland

crouches
bowing
her

crumbled
all

petals
for
the
thousand
and

fall
astrid

seeks
the
secret
of

in

she
will
find
the
secret
she
will
find
the
golden
key
to
the
riddle
on
the
night
when
she
has
numbered
them
marshalled
all
her
wild
flowers
ordered
them
as
music
star
by
star
note
by
note
changing
them
and
ranging
them
suddenly
as
at

he
shall
fold
her

her
on

all

one
now
this
is
the
secret
of
the
music
that
the
soul
hears
this
the
inimitable
lovers
they
tell
this
proud
tale
of
the
queen
cleopatra
subtlest
of
women
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
how
that
on
the
night
when
she
parted
with
her
lover
anthony
tearless
and
a
strange
thing
befell
them
in
the
darkness
where
they
stood
bitter
as
blood
was
that
darkness
and
they
stood
in
a
deep
window
looking
to
the
west
her
white
breast
was
brighter
than
the
moon
upon
the
sea
and
it
moved
in
her
agony
because
it
was
the
end
like
a
deep
sea
where
many
had
been
drowned
proud
ships
that
were
crowned
with
an
emperor
eagles
were
sunken
there
forgotten
with
their
emeralds
and
gold
they
had
drunken
of
that
glory
and
their
tale
was
told
utterly
told
there
as
they
parted
heart
from
heart
mouth
from
mouth
they
stared
upon
each
other
they
listened
for
the
brought
them
a
rumour
from
afar
and
she
said
lifting
her
head
too
beautiful
for
anguish
too
proud
for
pity
is
the
gods
that
leave
the
city
o
anthony
anthony
the
gods
have
forsaken
us
because
it
is
the
end
they
leave
us
to
our
doom
hear
it
and
unshaken
in
the
darkness
dull
as
dropping
earth
upon
a
tomb
in
the
distance
they
heard
as
when
across
a
wood
a
low
wind
comes
a
muttering
of
drums
drawing
nearer
then
louder
and
clearer
as
when
a
trumpet
sings
to
battle
it
came
rushing
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
a
sound
of
sacked
cities
a
sound
of
lamentation
a
cry
of
desolation
as
when
a
conquered
nation
is
weeping
in
the
darkness
because
its
tale
is
told
and
then
a
sound
of
chariots
that
rolled
thro
that
sorrow
trampled
like
a
storm
of
wild
stallions
tossing
nearer
trampled
louder
clearer
triumphantly
as
music
till
lo
in
that
great
darkness
along
that
vacant
street
a
red
light
beat
like
a
furnace
on
the
walls
then
like
the
blast
when
the
calls
to
battle
blaring
thro
the
tumult
and
the
flame
shaking
the
proud
city
as
they
came
an
hundred
elephants
and
bronze
and
splashed
with
bitter
crimson
trumpeting
for
battle
as
they
trod
an
hundred
elephants
bronze
and
and
trapped
with
gold
and
purple
towered
like
tuskéd
castles
every
footfall
dreadful
as
the
shattering
of
a
city
yet
they
trod
rocking
like
an
earthquake
to
a
great
triumphant
music
and
swinging
like
the
stars
black
planets
white
moons
thro
the
stream
of
the
torches
they
brought
the
red
chariot
the
chariot
of
the
mars
while
the
tall
spears
of
sparta
tossed
clashing
in
his
train
and
a
host
of
ghostly
warriors
cried
aloud
hail
to
those
twain
and
went
rushing
to
the
darkness
like
a
pageantry
of
cloud
for
their
tale
was
told
utterly
told
and
following
in
the
fury
of
the
vine
rushing
down
like
a
torrent
with
and
thyrse
and
many
a
wild
and
foaming
crown
of
roses
crowded
the
bacchanals
the
shepherds
the
leopards
and
the
glory
of
the
god
iacchus
without
dance
without
song
they
cried
and
swept
along
to
the
darkness
only
for
a
breath
when
the
tumult
of
their
torches
crimsoned
the
deep
window
where
that
dark
warrior
stood
with
the
blood
upon
his
mail
and
the
queen
cleopatra
frozen
to
white
marble
the
mænads
raised
their
timbrels
tossed
their
white
arms
with
a
clash
hail
like
wild
swimmers
pale
in
a
sea
of
blood
and
wine
hail
all
hail
then
they
swept
into
the
darkness
and
the
darkness
buried
them
their
tale
was
told
utterly
told
and
following
them
o
softer
than
the
moon
upon
the
sea
aphrodite
implacably
shone
like
a
furnace
of
white
roses
aphrodite
and
her
train
lifted
their
white
arms
to
those
twain
in
the
silence
once
and
were
gone
into
the
darkness
once
and
away
into
the
darkness
they
were
swept
like
a
pageantry
of
cloud
without
praise
without
pity
then
the
dark
city
slept
and
the
queen
cleopatra
subtlest
of
women
that
this
earth
has
ever
seen
turning
to
her
lover
in
the
darkness
where
he
stood
with
the
blood
upon
his
mail
bowing
her
head
upon
that
iron
in
the
darkness
wept
the
crags
memory
of
thomas
bailey
falernian
first
what
other
wine
should
brim
the
cup
or
tint
the
line
that
would
recall
my
days
among
your
creeks
and
bays
where
founded
on
a
rock
your
house
between
the
pines
unfading
boughs
watches
through
sun
and
rain
that
lonelier
coast
of
maine
and
the
atlantic
mounded
blue
breaks
on
your
crags
the
summer
through
a
long
pine
length
below
in
snow
while
on
your
railed
verandah
there
as
on
a
deck
you
sail
through
air
and
sea
and
cloud
and
sky
go
softly
streaming
by
like
delicate
oils
at
set
of
sun
smoothing
the
waves
the
colours
run
around
the
enchanted
hull
anchored
and
beautiful
restoring
to
that
star
you
brought
from
coral
isles
afar
with
shells
that
mock
the
moon
the
tints
of
their
lagoon
till
from
within
your
lamps
declare
your
harbours
by
the
colours
there
an
indian
god
a
fan
painted
in
old
japan
but
best
of
all
i
think
at
night
the
moon
that
makes
a
road
of
light
across
the
whispering
sea
a
road
for
memory
when
the
blue
dusk
has
filled
the
pane
and
the
great
burn
again
and
books
are
good
to
read
for
his
were
books
their
silken
shadows
rustling
dim
may
sing
no
more
of
spain
for
him
no
shadows
of
old
france
renew
their
courtly
dance
he
walks
no
more
where
shadows
are
but
left
their
ivory
gates
ajar
that
shadows
might
prolong
the
dance
the
tale
the
song
his
was
no
narrow
test
or
rule
he
chose
the
best
of
every
school
stendhal
and
keats
and
donne
balzac
and
stevenson
wordsworth
and
flaubert
filled
their
place
dumas
met
hawthorne
face
to
face
there
were
both
new
and
old
in
his
good
realm
of
gold
the
bore
his
name
and
nightly
by
the
dancing
flame
following
him
i
found
that
all
was
haunted
ground
until
a
friendlier
shadow
fell
upon
the
leaves
he
loved
so
well
and
i
no
longer
read
but
talked
with
him
instead
the
ghost
of
shakespeare
crimson
was
the
twilight
under
that
where
old
tales
tell
us
all
a
midsummer
night
a
mad
young
poacher
drunk
with
mead
of
lodged
with
the
and
looked
at
the
stars
there
from
the
dusk
where
the
dream
of
piers
plowman
darkens
on
the
sunset
to
this
dusk
of
our
own
i
read
in
a
history
the
record
of
our
world
the
the
the
shimmered
all
around
me
so
white
shone
those
pages
and
in
among
the
blue
boughs
the
bats
flew
low
i
slumbered
the
history
slipped
from
my
hand
then
i
saw
a
dead
man
dreadful
in
the
the
ghost
of
the
master
bowed
upon
that
book
he
muttered
as
he
searched
it
vast
convulsion
mocks
my
sexton
curse
now
shakes
our
english
clay
whereupon
i
told
him
and
asked
him
in
turn
whether
he
espied
any
light
in
those
pages
which
painted
an
epoch
later
than
his
own
am
a
he
said
i
see
am
a
he
said
i
see
then
o
then
he
murmured
to
himself
while
the
moon
hung
crimson
as
a
lanthorn
of
cathay
in
that
laughing
at
his
work
and
the
world
as
i
thought
yet
with
some
bitterness
yet
with
some
beauty
mocking
his
own
music
these
wraiths
of
his
rhymes
i
god
when
i
turn
the
leaves
of
that
dark
book
wherein
our
wisest
teach
us
to
recall
those
glorious
flags
which
in
old
tempests
shook
and
those
proud
thrones
which
held
my
youth
in
thrall
when
i
see
clear
what
seemed
to
childish
eyes
the
gorgeous
colouring
of
each
pictured
age
and
for
their
dominant
tints
now
recognise
those
prints
of
innocent
blood
on
every
page
o
then
i
know
this
world
is
fast
asleep
bound
in
time
womb
till
some
far
morning
break
and
though
light
grows
upon
the
dreadful
deep
we
are
dungeoned
in
thick
night
we
are
not
awake
the
world
unborn
for
all
our
hopes
and
schemes
and
all
its
myriads
only
move
in
dreams
ii
read
what
our
wisest
chroniclers
record
a
king
betrayed
both
foes
and
friends
to
death
delivered
his
own
country
to
the
sword
and
lied
and
lied
and
lied
to
his
last
breath
he
died
the
martyred
anarch
of
his
time
what
balm
is
this
that
consecrates
his
dust
the
history
shudders
at
the
crime
which
shed
a
blood
so
fragrant
so
august
yes
let
our
sons
by
thousands
millions
die
and
when
the
crowned
assassin
of
stands
in
the
judgment
hall
of
liberty
what
shall
your
desolate
nations
rise
and
say
honour
the
dog
he
vanquished
he
a
king
so
for
our
dead
he
too
august
a
thing
iii
was
a
crimson
twilight
under
that
moths
beat
about
me
and
bats
flew
low
i
read
in
a
history
the
record
of
our
world
if
there
be
light
said
the
master
i
am
a
shadow
and
i
see
none
i
am

i
see

clear

the

the

the

of
england
climbing
to
tintagel
where

wheel
cold
are
the
caverns
there
and
sullen
as
a
booming
back
the
grey
swell

gleams
like

balder
made
the

the
white

gone
away
older

the
down
with
its

shoulder
lifts
on
the
death
of
the
sun
out
of
the
valley
of
thyme
dropt
on
the
broad
chalk
path
and
cresting
the
ridge
of
it
smoulder
crimson
as
blood
on
the
white
halting
my
feet
as
they
climb
clusters
of
spilled
from
what
negligent
arms
in
the
tender
dusk
of
the
great
grey
world
last
of
the
tints
of
the
day
beautiful
sorrowful
strange
last
stain
of
that
perishing
splendour
elves
from
what
torn
white
feet
trickled
that
red
on
the
way
no
from
the
hands
of
what
lovers
that
fade
in
the
distance
here
was
it
here
that
they
paused
here
that
the
legend
was
told
even
a
kiss
would
be
heard
in
this
hush
but
with
mocking
insistence
now
thro
the
valley
resound
only
the
bells
of
the
fold
dropt
from
the
hands
of
what
beautiful
throng
did
they
cry
dancing
into
the
west
leaving
this
token
for
me
dead
on
the
path
and
the
sunset
to
bury
their
laughter
youth
is
it
youth
that
has
flown
darkness
covers
the

darkness
covers
the

fall
like

now
which
is
outlawed
which
alone
around
us
fall
and

murmurs
of

the
moan
of

outlawed
then
hills
and
woods
and
streams
are
outlawed
too
proud
world
from
our
immortal
dreams
we
banish
you
the
young
friar
when
leaves
broke
out
on
the
wild
briar
and
bells
for
matins
rung
sorrow
came
to
the
old
friar
hundreds
of
years
ago
it
was
and
may
came
to
the
young
the
old
was
ripening
for
the
sky
the
young
was
the
franklin
daughter
passed
him
by
reading
a
painted
beside
the
chapel
door
with
brown
cassock
and
sandalled
feet
and
red
spring
wine
for
blood
the
very
next
noon
he
chanced
to
meet
the
franklin
daughter
in
a
green
may
twilight
walking
through
the
wood
to
a
maid
the
crosiered
ferns
among
but
hers
was
only
the
saxon
and
his
the
norman
tongue
and
the
latin
taught
by
the
old
friar
made
music
for
the
young
and
never
a
better
deed
was
done
by
mother
church
below
than
when
she
made
old
england
one
hundreds
of
years
ago
it
was
hundreds
of
years
ago
rich
was
the
painted
page
they
read
before
that
sunset
died
hood
by
golden
head
murmuring
while
nesting
thrushes
cried
a
saxon
maid
with
flaxen
hair
and
eyes
of
sussex
grey
a
young
monk
out
of
normandy
may
is
our
lady
month
he
said
and
o
my
love
my
may
then
over
the
fallen
the
sung
till
rose
the
moon
and
bells
for
vespers
rung
it
was
gold
and
blue
for
the
old
friar
but
hawthorn
for
the
young
for
gown
of
green
and
brown
hood
before
that
curfew
tolled
had
flown
for
ever
through
the
wood
hundreds
of
years
ago
it
was
but
twenty
summers
old
and
empty
stood
his
chapel
stall
empty
his
thin
grey
cell
empty
her
seat
in
the
franklin
hall
and
there
were
swords
that
searched
for
them
before
the
matin
bell
and
crowders
tell
a
sword
that
night
wrought
them
an
evil
turn
and
that
the
may
was
not
more
white
than
those
white
bones
the
robin
found
among
the
roots
of
fern
but
others
tell
of
stranger
things
on
whitsun
eves
of
sweet
and
ghostly
whisperings
though
hundreds
of
years
ago
it
was
among
the
ghostly
leaves
te
grey
eyes
of
dew
antiqua
tam
augustine
heard
it
too
late
have
i
loved
that
may
lady
so
ancient
and
so
new
and
no
man
knows
where
they
were
flown
for
the
wind
takes
the
may
but
white
and
fresh
the
may
was
blown
though
hundreds
of
years
ago
it
was
as
this
that
blooms
and
the
leaves
break
out
on
the
wild
briar
and
bells
must
still
be
rung
but
sorrow
comes
to
the
old
friar
for
he
remembers
a
may
a
may
when
his
old
heart
was
young
a
forest
song
who
would
be
a
king
that
can
sit
in
the
sun
and
sing
nay
i
have
a
kingdom
of
mine
own
a
fallen
is
my
throne
pluck
the
strings
and
tell
me
true
if
cæsar
in
his
glory
knew
the
worlds
he
lost
in
sun
and
who
would
be
a
queen
that
sees
what
my
love
hath
seen
the
blood
of
little
children
shed
to
make
one
royal
ruby
red
tell
me
music
why
the
great
for
quarrelling
trumpets
abdicate
this
quick
this
absolute
nay
who
would
sing
in
heaven
among
the
choral
seven
that
hears
as
love
and
i
have
heard
the
whole
sky
listening
to
one
bird
where
the
ruby
tell
me
where
whose
crimsons
for
one
breath
compare
with

resumes
his

all
the

of
the

the
visions
that
were
music
being
shaped
by

moving
in

treading
the

that
suns

tread
o

only
the

only
the

attuned
to
that
dread

of

throughout

can

only
the

that
plays
its

in

terrestrial

till
it
soar
into

only

climbing

may
walk

shape

from

conquer
death
lay

at

the

must
beat
in

and
no

breaks
that
old
restriction
murmurs
reach
it
still

of
that
vast

which
resolves
our

to
this
to
this
attuned
though
blindly
it
responds
in
notes
like
these
there
was
a
song
in
heaven
of
old
a
song
the
choral
seven
began
when
god
with
all
his
chariots
rolled
the
tides
of
chaos
back
for
man
when
suns
revolved
and
planets
wheeled
and
the
great
oceans
ebbed
and
flowed
there
is
one
way
of
life
it
pealed
the
road
of
law
the
unchanging
road
the
trumpet
of
the
law
resounds
and
we
behold
from
depth
to
height
what
glittering
sentries
walk
their
rounds
what
ordered
hosts
patrol
the
night
while
wheeling
worlds
proclaim
to
us
captained
by
thee
thro
nights
unknown
that
would
be
glorious
must
keep
thy
law
to
find
its
beyond
rebellion
past
caprice
from
heavens
that
comprehend
all
change
all
space
all
time
till
time
shall
cease
the
trumpet
rings
to
souls
that
range
to
souls
that
in
wild
dreams
annul
thy
word
confessed
by
wood
and
stone
that
would
be
beautiful
must
keep
thy
law
to
find
its
he
that
can
shake
it
will
he
thrust
his
careless
hands
into
the
fire
he
that
would
break
it
shall
we
trust
the
sun
to
rise
at
his
desire
constant
above
our
discontent
the
trumpet
peals
in
sterner
tone
that
would
be
omnipotent
must
keep
thy
law
to
find
its
ah
though
beneath
unpitying
spheres
unreckoned
seems
our
human
cry
in
thy
deep
law
beyond
the
years
abides
the
eternal
memory
thy
law
is
light
to
eyes
grown
dull
dreaming
of
worlds
like
bubbles
blown
mercy
that
is
merciful
shall
keep
thy
law
and
find
its
unchanging
god
by
that
one
light
through
which
we
grope
to
truth
and
thee
confound
not
yet
our
day
with

of

hear
not

thy

liberty
and
in
thy
law
we
find

to

music
rose
our
world
the
boughs
put
forth
the
young
leaves
groped
for
light
the
wild
flower
spread
its
petals
as
in
prayer
then
for
terrestrial
ears
vast
discords
rose
the
struggle
in
the
jungle
clashing
themes
that
strove
for
mastery
but
above
them
all
ever
the
mightier
measure
of
the
suns
resolved
them
into
broader
harmonies
that
fought
again
for
mastery
the
night
buried
the
mastodon
the
warring
tribes
of
men
were
merged
in
nations
wider
laws
embraced
them
man
no
longer
fought
with
man
though
nation
warred
with
nation
hatred
fell
before
the
gaze
of
love
for
in
an
hour
when
by
the
law
of
might
mankind
could
rise
no
higher
into
the
deepening
music
stole
a
loftier
theme
a
law
that
gathered
all
the
laws
of
earth
into
its
broadening
breast
and
moved
like
one
full
river
to
the
sea
the
law
of
love
the
sun
stood
dark
at
noon
dark
as
the
moon
before
this
mightier
power
and
a
voice
rang
across
the
earth
am
the
way
the
truth
the
life
the
we
heard
it
and
we
did
not
hear
in
dreams
we
caught
a
thousand
fragments
of
the
strain
but
never
wholly
heard
it
we
moved
on
obeying
it
a
little
till
our
world
became
so
vast
that
we
could
only
hear
stray
notes
a
golden
phrase
a
sorrowful
cry
never
the
rounded
glory
of
the
whole
so
one
would
sing
of
death
one
of
despair
and
some
knowing
that
god
was
more
than
man
knowing
that
the
eternal
power
behind
our
universe
was
more
than
man
would
shrink
from
crowning
him
with
human
attributes
though
these
remained
the
highest
that
we
knew
and
therefore
falling
back
on
lower
signs
bereft
of
love
thought
personality
they
made
him
less
than
man
made
him
a
blind
unweeting
force
less
than
the
best
in
man
less
than
the
best
that
he
himself
had
made
yet
though
from
earth
we
could
no
longer
hear
as
from
a
central
throne
the
harmonies
of
the
revolving
whole
yet
though
from
earth
and
from
earth
calvary
the
central
scene
withdrew
to
dreadful
depths
beyond
our
ken
withdrew
to
some
deep
calvary
at
the
heart
of
all
creation
yet
o
yet
we
heard
echoes
that
murmured
from
eternity
am
the
way
the
truth
the
life
the
and
still
the
eternal
passion
undiscerned
moved
like
a
purple
shadow
through
our
world
while
we
in
intellectual
chaos
raised
the
ancient
cry
this
man
but
then
might
grew
right
once
more
for
who
could
hold
the
right
when
the
rebellious
hearts
of
men
finding
the
law
too
hard
in
life
thought
art
proclaimed
that
right
itself
was
born
of
chance
born
out
of
nothingness
and
doomed
at
last
to
nothingness
while
all
that
men
have
held
better
than
dust
love
honour
justice
truth
was
less
than
dust
for
the
blind
dust
endures
but
love
they
said
and
the
proud
soul
of
man
die
with
the
breath
before
the
flesh
decays
and
still
amidst
the
chaos
love
was
born
suffered
and
died
and
in
a
myriad
forms
a
myriad
parables
of
the
eternal
christ
unfolded
their
deep
message
to
mankind
so
on
this
last
wild
winter
of
his
birth
though
cannon
rocked
his
cradle
heaven
might
hear
once
more
the
mother
and
her
infant
child
the
five
chime
tonight
child
the
red
earth
would
shake
with
will
the
emperors
laugh
outright
if
roland
rings
that
christ
is
born
no
belfries
pealed
for
that
pure
birth
there
were
no
choirs
to
sing
the
blood
of
children
smoked
on
earth
for
herod
in
those
days
was
then
the
mother
and
her
son
were
refugees
that
christmas
too
through
all
the
ages
little
one
that
strange
old
story
still
comes
there
no
peace
in
bethlehem
yes
there
was
love
in
one
poor
inn
and
while
his
wings
were
over
them
they
heard
those
deeper
songs
songs
were
they
what
songs
were
they
did
stars
of
shrapnel
shed
their
light
o
little
child
i
have
lost
the
way
i
can
not
find
that
inn
there
no
peace
then
anywhere
perhaps
where
some
poor
soldier
lies
with
all
his
wounds
in
front
out
weep
he
had
your
innocent
is
it
true
that
christ
a
slave
whom
all
these
wrongs
can
never
rouse
they
said
it
but
his
anger
drave
the
from
his
he
forgave
and
turned
yes
unto
seventy
times
and
seven
but
they
forget
he
comes
one
day
in
power
among
the
clouds
of
roland
rings
yes
little
son
with
iron
hammers
they
dare
not
scorn
roland
is
breaking
them
gun
by
gun
roland
is
ringing
christ
is
born
born
and
for
though
the
christ
we
knew
on
earth
be
dead
for
ever
who
shall
kill
the
eternal
christ
whose
law
is
in
our
hearts
christ
who
in
this
dark
hour
descends
to
hell
and
ascends
into
heaven
and
sits
beside
the
right
hand
of
the
father
if
for
men
this
law
be
dead
it
lives
for
children
still
children
that
men
have
butchered
see
his
face
rest
in
his
arms
and
strike
our
mockery
dumb
so
shall
the
trumpet
of
the
law
resound
through
all
the
ages
telling
of
that
child
whose
outstretched
arms
in
belgium
speak
for
god
they
crucified
a
man
of
old
the
thorns
are
shrivelled
on
his
brow
prophet
or
fool
or
god
behold
they
crucify
thy
children
now
they
doubted
evil
doubted
good
and
the
eternal
heavens
as
well
behold
the
iron
and
the
blood
the
visible
handiwork
of
hell
fast
to
the
cross
they
found
it
there
they
found
it
in
the
village
street
a
naked
child
with
sunkissed
hair
the
nails
were
through
its
hands
and
feet
for
christ
was
dead
yes
christ
was
dead
o
lamb
of
god
o
little
one
i
kneel
before
your
cross
instead
and
the
same
shadow
veils
the
sun
and
the
same
shadow
veils
the
sun
but
you
o
land
o
beautiful
land
of
freedom
hold
fast
the
faith
which
made
and
keeps
you
great
with
you
with
you
abide
the
faith
and
hope
in
this
dark
hour
of
agonised
mankind
hold
to
that
law
whereby
the
warring
tribes
were
merged
in
nations
hold
to
that
wide
law
which
bids
you
merge
the
nations
here
and
now
into
one
people
hold
to
that
deep
law
whereby
we
reach
the
peace
which
is
not
death
but
the
triumphant
harmony
of
life
eternal
life
immortal
love
the
peace
of
worlds
that
sing
around
the
throne
of
god
thus
only
should
it
come
if
come
it
must
not
with
a
riot
of
flags
and
a
cry
but
with
a
noble
faith
a
conscience
high
that
if
we
fail
we
failed
not
in
our
trust
we
fought
for
peace
we
dared
the
bitter
thrust
of
calumny
for
peace
and
watched
her
die
her
scutcheons
rent
from
sky
to
outraged
sky
by
felon
hands
and
trampled
into
the
dust
we
proffered
justice
and
we
saw
the
law
cancelled
by
stroke
on
stroke
of
those
deft
hands
which
still
retain
the
imperial
forger
pen
they
must
have
blood
then
at
this
last
we
draw
the
sword
not
with
a
riot
of
flags
and
bands
but
silence
and
a
mustering
of
men
they
challenge
truth
a
people
makes
reply
east
west
north
south
one
honour
and
one
might
from
sea
to
sea
from
height
to
height
the
old
word
rings
out
to
conquer
or
to
die
and
we
shall
conquer
though
their
eagles
fly
through
heaven
around
this
ancient
isle
unite
powers
that
were
never
vanquished
in
the
fight
the
unconquerable
powers
that
can
not
lie
though
fire
destroy
her
flesh
and
many
a
year
this
land
forgot
the
faith
that
made
her
great
now
as
her
fleets
cast
off
the
north
sea
foam
casting
aside
all
faction
and
all
fear
in
all
the
majesty
of
her
fate
britain
remembers
and
her
sword
strikes
home
the
grow
my
song
like
a
tree
as
thou
hast
ever
grown
since
first
a
wondering
child
long
since
i
cherished
thee
it
was
at
break
of
day
well
i
remember
it
the
first
note
that
i
heard
a
magical
undertone
sweeter
than
any
bird
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
and
my
tears
ran
wild
this
tale
this
tale
is
true
the
light
was
growing
gray
and
the
rhymes
ran
so
sweet
for
i
was
only
a
child
that
i
knelt
down
to
pray
grow
my
song
like
a
tree
since
then
i
have
forgot
a
thousand
friends
but
not
the
song
that
set
me
free
so
that
to
thee
i
gave
my
hopes
and
my
despairs
my
boyhood
ecstasy
my
manhood
prayers
in
dreams
i
have
watched
thee
grow
a
ladder
of
sweet
boughs
where
angels
come
and
go
and
birds
keep
house
in
dreams
i
have
seen
thee
wave
over
a
distant
land
and
watched
thy
roots
expand
and
given
my
life
to
thee
as
i
would
give
my
grave
grow
my
song
like
a
tree
and
when
i
am
grown
old
let
me
die
under
thee
die
to
enrich
thy
mould
die
at
thy
roots
and
so
help
thee
to
grow
make
of
this
body
and
blood
thy
sempiternal
food
then
let
some
little
child
some
friend
i
shall
not
see
when
the
great
dawn
is
gray
some
lover
i
have
not
known
in
summers
far
away
sit
listening
under
thee
and
in
thy
rustling
hear
that
mystical
undertone
which
made
my
tears
run
wild
and
made
thee
o
how
dear
in
the
great
years
to
be
i
am
proud
then
ah
not
so
i
have
lived
and
died
for
thee
be
patient
grow
grow
my
song
like
a
tree
