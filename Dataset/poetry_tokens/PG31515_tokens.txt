the
rake
progress
i
borrow
de
quincey
confessions
of
an
opium
eater
the
aforementioned
an
account
of
that
singular
oriental
vice
whereupon
misplacing
the
volume
in
transit
from
the
checkpoint
i
attempt
to
capsulize
the
book
misadventures
only
to
suffer
taciturnity
on
the
part
of
the
staff
until
the
duplicity
of
a
continued
numbers
game
in
chinese
wearing
thin
and
with
lassitude
similar
to
the
opium
habit
the
chief
librarian
a
girl
herself
of
eastern
domesticity
greets
my
queries
with
hushed
tones
and
solemnity
akin
to
a
leering
siamese
or
bedridden
cheshire
cat
regalia
if
the
rich
are
different
they
show
it
with
the
clarity
of
their
table
as
fitzgerald
decried
the
breathless
hush
of
their
garden
regalias
the
manner
in
which
wedgewood
crystal
are
cleaned
to
a
polished
exactness
the
shimmer
of
expensive
china
no
less
repetitive
than
the
hulking
boys
waiting
in
window
stops
monsoon
rain
pelting
the
upper
punjab
plains
desire
sleep
is
a
striking
woman
accosted
by
various
men
while
in
a
dance
the
warring
desires
thus
present
themselves
as
on
a
battlefield
hunger
comes
arrayed
with
red
plumes
to
befit
his
appetites
sensuality
somewhat
decked
out
as
a
dandy
in
a
mauve
waistcoat
and
of
course
there
is
fear
the
most
thwarted
of
the
suitors
bejewelled
with
a
flashing
sabre
rattling
it
from
the
tail
of
his
skinny
stick
horse
the
pale
charger
riding
to
intercept
the
beautiful
courtesan
sleep
bestowing
her
favours
illicitly
wherein
she
would
but
choose
pondicherry
chess
pieces
resting
upon
the
jade
mantle
piece
see
sampans
move
quietly
thru
warm
night
rich
bundles
of
bougainvillea
crowd
market
squares
where
deck
chairs
extend
to
the
persian
gulf
leisured
gentlemen
finger
walking
canes
hold
eyelids
thick
as
goblets
sharp
tridents
beside
private
lairs
skin
in
puffy
whiteness
bulges
under
lamp
white
glare
becomes
copra
gathered
miles
from
pondicherry
sesame
oil
in
rotting
casks
and
the
indian
heat
closing
with
certitude
akin
to
the
trance
of
the
snake
charmer
holds
his
flute
poised
with
the
bengali
lancer
riding
a
slow
crop
over
the
prostrate
polo
ball
mangroves
how
do
you
survive
in
the
mangrove
swamps
amid
the
twitchings
of
foetid
water
lice
thick
as
baby
tears
how
with
all
the
wallow
of
thick
muck
making
suction
noises
and
the
teams
in
relays
searching
nightly
with
baited
hounds
do
you
pull
free
your
bamboo
pole
knows
every
ploy
but
a
slender
craft
to
sparring
blows
from
every
quarter
the
undergrowth
necessitates
the
closeness
of
the
clammy
night
heaved
about
like
so
much
rotting
fruit
will
draw
the
ants
devouring
like
that
abundance
of
cold
yellow
eye
the
firefly
swarms
that
mock
your
heavy
steel
machete
arm
across
the
drift
of
darkness
and
the
insect
life
you
bat
in
swarms
the
ultimate
danger
is
not
in
the
cayman
giant
or
his
reptilian
cousin
named
of
copper
wire
the
anaconda
or
even
mindless
holes
thick
black
ooze
that
throttles
a
victim
but
two
legged
form
coming
searching
a
spectre
on
hind
quarters
with
a
bolo
knife
stepping
free
of
that
beaded
circle
the
inner
camp
the
end
