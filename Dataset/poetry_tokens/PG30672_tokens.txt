traverse
oft
in

the
introduction
to
eidolon
hazlitt
says
one
can
not
make
an
allegory
go
on
all
fours
it
must
to
a
certain
degree
be
obscure
and
shadowy
like
the
images
which
the
traveller
in
the
desert
sees
mirrored
on
the
heavens
wherein
he
can
trace
but
a
dreamy
resemblance
to
the
reality
beneath
it
therefore
seems
to
me
advisable
to
give
a
solution
of
the
eidolon
the
symbol
which
follows
that
the
purpose
of
the
poem
may
at
once
be
evident
in
eidolon
i
have
attempted
to
symbol
the
course
of
a
poet
mind
from
a
state
wherein
thought
is
disordered
barren
and
uncultivated
to
that
which
is
ordered
and
swayed
by
the
true
spirit
of
poetry
and
holds
its
perfect
creed
i
have
therefore
laid
the
scene
on
a
desert
island
whence
as
from
the
isolation
of
his
own
mind
he
reflects
upon
the
concerns
of
life
at
first
he
is
a
poet
only
by
birthright
he
has
the
poet
inherent
love
for
the
beautiful
his
keen
susceptibility
of
all
that
is
lovely
in
outward
nature
but
these
are
only
the
blossoms
which
have
fallen
upon
him
from
the
tree
of
life
the
fruit
is
yet
untasted
he
has
looked
at
the
evil
of
the
world
alone
and
seeing
how
much
the
time
is
out
of
joint
has
become
misanthropic
and
turns
his
back
alike
on
the
evil
and
the
good
then
comes
night
the
stillness
of
the
soul
with
starlight
breaking
through
the
gloom
he
gazes
on
other
worlds
and
pictures
there
the
perfection
he
sighs
for
but
can
not
find
in
this
thus
by
the
conception
of
a
higher
and
nobler
existence
acquiring
some
impetus
towards
its
realization
we
then
find
him
lying
in
the
sunshine
with
the
beauties
of
nature
around
him
whose
silent
teaching
works
upon
him
till
the
true
spirit
of
poetry
speaks
his
and
combats
the
misanthropy
and
weakness
of
the
sensuous
man
showing
him
that
action
is
the
end
of
life
not
mere
indulgence
in
abstract
and
visionary
rhapsodies
in
the
next
scene
he
makes
further
advances
for
the
spirit
of
poetry
shows
him
that
the
beauty
for
which
he
has
sought
amongst
the
stars
of
heaven
lies
really
at
his
feet
that
earth
too
is
a
star
capable
of
equal
brightness
with
those
on
which
he
gazes
he
is
thus
brought
from
the
ideal
to
the
real
the
fifth
scene
emblems
the
influence
of
love
on
the
soul
it
is
the
nurse
of
poetry
and
sorrow
is
the
pang
which
stimulates
the
divine
germ
into
active
vitality
had
he
been
entirely
happy
and
the
course
of
his
love
run
smooth
he
would
have
been
content
to
enjoy
life
in
ease
and
idleness
next
we
find
him
looking
broadly
on
life
on
its
utmost
ills
as
well
as
its
beauties
but
not
with
the
eye
of
the
misanthrope
but
of
the
physician
who
searches
out
disease
that
he
may
find
the
remedy
and
though
the
soul
still
sighs
for
the
serenity
and
placid
delight
of
the
ideal
life
the
world
of
thought
the
glorious
principle
of
poetry
prevails
and
he
sacrifices
feeling
that
he
has
a
nobler
mission
than
to
dream
through
life
and
that
here
he
must
labour
ere
he
can
earn
the
right
to
rest
thus
in
the
last
scene
the
spirit
and
the
man
have
become
one
he
is
a
poet
his
prayer
maintains
the
direct
and
divine
inspiration
of
the
the
action
in
short
is
the
conflict
of
two
principles
within
the
breast
the
false
and
the
true
ending
in
the
extinction
of
error
and
the
triumph
of
truth

scene
desert
island
the
man
how
lonely
were
i
in
this
solitude
this
atom
of
creation
which
yon
wave
white
with
the
fury
of
a
thousand
years
might
gulf
into
oblivion
if
the
soul
knew
circumscription
far
as
eye
can
reach
around
me
lies
a
wild
and
watery
waste
with
every
billow
sentinel
to
keep
its
prisoner
fetter
to
his
ocean
cell
what
were
it
but
a
plunge
an
instant
strife
then
liberty
snatch
from
the
clutch
of
death
the
tyrant
who
with
mystic
terror
grinds
men
into
slaves
but
he
who
thinks
free
and
fineless
as
the
unresting
winds
of
heaven
now
rushing
with
wild
joy
around
the
belt
of
whirling
saturn
then
away
through
space
till
he
and
all
his
radiant
brotherhood
dwindle
to
round
the
brow
of
night
thought
is
the
great
creator
under
god
begotten
of
his
breathing
that
can
raise
shapes
from
the
dust
and
give
them
beauty
soul
and
though
my
empire
be
a
continent
squared
down
from
leagues
to
inches
what
of
that
the
mind
contains
a
world
within
its
frame
which
fancy
peoples
with
radiant
forms
replete
with
life
and
spirit
excellence
o
there
is
glory
in
the
thought
that
now
i
stand
absolved
from
all
the
chilling
forms
and
falsities
of
life
that
like
frail
reeds
pierce
the
blind
palms
of
those
that
lean
on
them
and
from
the
springs
of
my
own
being
draw
all
strength
and
hope
and
joyance
all
that
makes
lone
meditations
sweet
and
schools
the
heart
for
prophecy
in
the
world
we
seem
like
babes
that
can
not
walk
alone
but
fasten
on
the
skirts
of
other
men
their
creeds
conclusions
and
vain
phantasies
too
languid
or
too
weak
to
poize
ourselves
but
here
the
crutch
is
shattered
at
a
blow
dependence
made
a
thing
for
winds
to
blast
and
paraphrase
in
bitter
mockery
from
this
retreat
as
from
a
cloister
calm
i
dream
upon
the
busy
haunts
of
men
as
things
that
touch
me
not
an
empire
riven
a
monarchy
here
seem
to
me
importless
as
a
death
the
world
and
all
its
revolutions
are
now
less
within
my
chronicles
than
is
the
ken
of
a
star
orbit
on
the
fines
of
space
but
like
a
mariner
saved
from
the
wreck
on
this
calm
spot
i
stand
unscathed
secure
from
the
rough
throbbings
of
the
sea
of
strife
and
woe
and
clamour
wherewith
this
world
life
ebbs
and
declines
unto
the
printless
shore
of
death
o
blessed
change
if
there
were
one
to
love
me
in
this
solitude
and
make
life
beautiful
my
soul
is
wearied
out
with
earth
fierce
warfare
and
its
selfish
ease
the
slights
and
coldness
of
the
hollow
crowds
that
are
its
arbiters
the
changeful
face
the
upstart
arrogance
of
fools
who
crown
them
with
their
golden
dross
and
deem
the
badge
of
sovereignty
o
thou
my
heart
hast
thou
not
framed
for
life
a
golden
palace
in
all
solitude
whither
the
strains
of
quiet
melodies
float
on
the
breath
of
memory
like
songs
from
the
dim
bosom
of
the
evening
woods
peopling
its
chambers
with
sweet
poesy
hast
thou
not
called
the
sunshine
from
the
morn
to
circle
thee
with
a
pure
spirit
life
and
with
the
softness
of
its
tender
arms
clasp
thee
in
the
embrace
of
love
hast
thou
not
heard
the
music
of
the
stars
in
the
calm
stillness
of
the
summer
night
and
read
their
jewell
pages
and
like
the
bright
inspirations
of
a
bard
till
glowing
strophes
rung
within
thy
soul
of
glad
orion
and
clear
pleiades
hast
thou
not
seen
the
moonshine
thrill
upon
the
dusky
mantle
of
the
night
like
radiant
glances
through
a
maiden
veil
till
shaken
thence
they
fell
in
a
pure
shower
flood
and
field
and
bosky
wilderness
wreathing
earth
with
the
glory
of
a
saint
o
thus
to
dwell
far
from
the
stir
of
life
far
from
its
pleasures
and
its
miseries
far
from
the
panting
cry
of
man
desire
that
waileth
upward
in
hoarse
discontent
and
here
to
list
but
to
that
liquid
voice
that
riseth
in
the
spirit
and
whose
flow
is
like
a
rivulet
from
paradise
to
hear
the
wanderings
of
divine
thought
within
the
soul
like
the
low
ebb
and
flow
of
waters
in
the
ocean
caves
forming
itself
a
speech
and
melody
sweeter
than
words
unto
the
aching
sense
to
stand
alone
with
nature
where
man
step
hath
never
bowed
a
its
weight
nor
hath
the
sound
of
his
rude
utterance
broken
the
pauses
of
the
song
and
thus
in
its
unpeopled
solitude
to
be
the
spirit
of
this
universe
centering
thought
and
reason
in
one
frame
and
in
the
majesty
of
quenchless
soul
rising
unto
the
stature
of
a
man
is
to
make
life
glorious
and
great
dissolving
matter
in
the
spiritual
as
the
green
pine
dissolveth
into
flame
not
on
the
breath
of
popular
applause
that
is
the
spectre
of
all
nothingness
not
on
the
fawning
of
a
servile
crew
who
kiss
the
hem
of
fortune
purple
robe
and
lick
the
dust
before
prosperity
waiting
the
cogging
of
the
downward
scale
to
turn
from
slaves
to
bravos
in
the
dark
not
on
the
favours
of
the
politic
who
in
the
smile
of
honour
pamper
the
pampered
from
their
banquet
halls
but
to
his
starving
cry
when
fortune
frowns
mutter
their
falsehoods
through
the
bolted
gate
but
in
the
brightness
of
the
inner
soul
the
placitude
of
peace
and
holy
thought
the
joyous
lightness
of
the
spirit
wings
sweeping
with
equal
strokes
the
azure
sky
of
present
past
and
wide
futurity
in
the
high
tidemarks
on
the
sands
of
life
where
thought
hath
swept
her
purifying
wave
bearing
the
treasures
of
the
unsearched
deep
to
swell
the
riches
of
humanity
is
a
happiness
apart
from
man
to
aid
to
sympathise
with
or
destroy
in
its
calm
solitude
alike
secure
from
the
broad
adulation
of
the
weak
and
the
strained
condescension
of
the
great
both
insults
to
the
mighty
soul
within
that
is
not
prized
but
for
its
golden
shrine
here
there
is
that
which
makes
the
spirit
free
and
noble
in
the
measure
of
its
strength
untrammelled
by
conventionalities
that
make
the
very
light
of
heaven
take
worth
according
to
the
casement
it
shines
through
o
solitude
thy
blessed
power
hath
swept
all
earthly
passions
from
my
soul
like
weeds
that
choke
the
issues
of
eternal
love
what
now
to
me
are
hatred
and
revenge
thoughts
that
if
fleeting
through
the
mind
would
fall
like
unknown
birds
upon
a
foreign
shore
strange
wonderful
where
no
false
hearts
are
nigh
to
poison
life
with
variance
and
strife
o
holy
nature
thou
art
only
love
and
peace
and
universal
unity
from
thy
sweet
bosom
springeth
up
no
seed
of
bitterness
and
sorrow
that
like
thorns
cling
to
the
vesture
of
mortality
piercing
the
spirit
through
with
cruel
woe
with
thee
my
soul
could
dwell
for
evermore
expanding
all
good
feelings
day
by
day
till
at
the
last
like
roses
in
full
bloom
the
blossoms
fall
from
pure
maturity
pride
here
no
scale
of
inches
is
set
up
for
man
to
strain
his
littleness
against
but
me
hangs
the
majesty
of
heaven
bright
with
the
glory
of
the
noontide
sun
beneath
the
earth
that
whispers
thou
art
dust
gat
like
a
child
forth
from
my
fertile
womb
and
bone
of
my
bone
thus
flesh
of
my
flesh
thou
glorious
firmament
that
like
god
love
enfoldest
all
creation
utterly
making
the
pathway
of
the
wheeling
spheres
a
splendour
and
a
triumph
and
a
joy
that
on
the
brightness
of
thine
azure
breast
settest
the
constellated
stars
like
gems
to
flash
the
glory
of
thy
loveliness
through
all
the
fulness
of
unmeasured
space
can
madness
in
its
raving
cast
a
thought
to
soar
unto
thy
blessed
perfectness
nor
stand
subdued
with
reverence
and
awe
in
contemplation
of
the
infinite
o
earth
thou
mother
and
true
monitress
can
thy
frail
children
close
their
ears
for
aye
the
warnings
of
thy
voice
in
the
wild
whirl
of
life
the
tones
may
die
amid
the
clangour
of
contending
foes
but
here
as
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
thy
solemn
teaching
falleth
on
the
soul
to
the
vibration
of
the
low
then
what
is
there
to
charm
me
back
to
life
to
wrestle
with
the
guilty
and
the
vain
and
lose
identity
amid
the
crowd
who
struggle
onward
after
base
desire
this
quiet
scene
doth
teach
me
how
to
weigh
your
pleasures
and
your
vanities
aright
to
hold
as
dross
the
honour
that
is
flung
around
man
like
a
winter
covering
which
the
same
hand
can
pluck
away
again
and
leave
the
outcast
shivering
in
the
blast
there
is
no
honour
saving
that
within
which
none
nor
man
nor
death
itself
can
snatch
but
which
falls
from
the
spirit
in
its
flight
like
a
prophetic
mantle
upon
time
pleasure
o
world
in
thine
insanity
thou
sinkest
soul
into
a
poor
buffoon
garbëd
in
tinsel
and
false
ornament
to
play
its
antics
on
the
stage
of
life
a
thing
for
fools
to
laugh
at
in
their
mirth
thou
thy
lust
upon
the
sapless
husks
that
strew
the
highways
of
this
pilgrimage
closing
thine
eyes
unto
their
emptiness
and
out
of
folly
turning
sour
to
sweet
hast
thou
the
joy
that
nature
converse
sheds
thro
all
the
pulses
of
the
quiet
soul
the
gentle
calm
that
like
a
whispered
song
steals
the
sense
with
sweetest
languishment
hast
thou
the
magic
of
the
beautiful
wreathing
about
thy
spirit
evermore
in
sunshine
and
in
shadow
when
the
stars
gather
around
the
azure
dome
of
heaven
and
the
pale
moon
glides
like
a
virgin
bride
humbly
behind
the
footsteps
of
her
love
when
the
sweet
morn
dawns
on
the
sleeping
world
to
bring
reality
to
visions
bright
and
on
the
curtain
of
dissolving
mist
arches
the
sign
of
heaven
hast
thou
the
minstrelsie
of
the
wild
woods
strains
floating
along
the
sky
swelling
subsiding
like
a
silvery
sea
beneath
the
dulcet
breathing
of
the
south
hast
thou
that
essence
of
all
joyousness
the
glorious
independence
of
the
soul
that
spurneth
man
usurpëd
tyranny
the
power
of
wealth
and
hapless
circumstance
and
sweeping
on
its
own
unaided
wings
measures
the
circuit
of
the
boundless
sky
what
is
thy
wealth
that
fadeth
in
the
use
and
all
the
pomp
and
vanity
it
buys
to
the
rich
treasure
of
undying
thought
encreasing
evermore
till
like
a
dower
it
benizon
humanity
for
aye
all
thy
poor
gold
resolveth
into
dust
before
the
test
of
such
a
scene
as
this
can
it
charm
forth
the
blossom
of
a
flower
ere
summer
bids
it
with
her
gentle
smile
can
it
restore
the
verdure
to
the
leaf
when
yellow
autumn
marks
it
for
her
own
or
in
the
noontide
bid
the
rise
to
fill
one
rosy
chalice
to
the
brim
go
gild
thee
with
it
worldling
as
thou
wilt
yet
all
thy
pains
will
leave
thee
but
a
fool
ay
there
is
love
to
beckon
me
away
and
lead
me
to
a
fountain
of
delight
gliding
before
me
in
its
purity
like
some
bright
angel
guiding
souls
to
heaven
o
love
have
i
not
drained
thee
to
the
dregs
thy
pleasures
and
thy
sorrows
equally
clinging
unto
thee
as
the
arab
doth
to
his
low
fountain
in
the
wilderness
have
i
not
gazed
into
thy
tender
eyes
and
read
the
secret
of
thy
holiness
cleansing
my
soul
in
humbleness
and
faith
to
shrine
thee
in
thy
fulness
evermore
have
i
not
clasped
thee
in
my
frenzied
arms
and
heard
thy
answer
back
to
mine
fainter
and
fainter
till
the
deep
voice
stilled
in
the
eternal
silence
of
the
grave
o
be
to
me
henceforth
but
some
sweet
dream
illumining
the
sky
of
memory
a
fixëd
star
of
everlasting
light
to
pilot
me
along
the
sea
of
life
and
keep
the
bearings
of
the
spirit
true
visit
me
in
imagination
train
the
sweetest
and
the
fairest
child
of
thought
till
thro
my
being
as
thro
columned
aisles
when
incense
from
the
altar
upward
wreaths
there
float
the
fragrance
of
thy
breath
divine
circle
my
soul
in
its
far
wanderings
thro
spirit
lands
and
empyrean
heights
where
though
it
sink
in
wide
bewilderment
thou
wilt
enfold
it
in
thy
dewy
arms
and
pillow
it
to
strength
and
fearlessness
be
to
me
like
a
heaven
beyond
all
time
dreamt
of
and
worshipped
in
this
pilgrimage
the
habitation
of
all
pure
desire
solace
of
sorrow
and
the
home
of
rest
where
i
may
lay
me
from
life
troublous
way
and
feel
eternity
rise
in
my
soul
no
world
the
cords
that
bound
me
unto
thee
are
snapt
in
sunder
to
join
again
thy
voice
is
waning
fainter
on
mine
ear
and
thine
allurements
powerless
and
vain
there
springeth
up
within
me
a
new
want
a
perfect
yearning
for
the
spiritual
that
shaketh
from
its
pinions
all
the
cares
and
interests
of
earth
like
cleaving
dust
that
clogs
its
upward
winging
to
the
skies
wend
onward
as
thou
wilt
in
weal
or
woe
swell
the
rude
triumph
of
thy
battle
march
spread
thy
gay
banners
broadly
to
the
wind
and
let
thy
clarions
ring
among
the
spheres
laurel
thy
heroes
and
thy
favourites
and
pluck
the
crowns
again
from
off
their
brows
worship
thy
follies
and
thine
empty
gains
and
barter
life
for
mammon
gold
for
dross
here
let
me
lie
upon
the
rear
of
time
unheeded
unremembered
and
alone
like
a
quick
seed
dropt
by
a
flying
dove
that
groweth
unto
blossom
and
to
fruit
scene
man
how
still
are
all
things
now
in
earth
and
heaven
from
the
woods
no
rippling
stir
breaks
on
the
shore
of
silence
the
sweet
birds
that
sing
like
naiads
from
the
crystal
deeps
amid
the
murmurous
coverts
now
are
mute
as
dreams
of
faded
happiness
and
life
seems
calmly
in
the
arms
of
death
the
far
waves
alone
are
rocking
in
unrest
with
moonlight
flashing
them
but
their
sound
dies
in
their
own
wild
bosom
like
a
song
murmuring
in
the
spirit
of
a
man
thus
is
a
poet
soul
around
it
hangs
the
darkness
of
this
world
reality
its
cares
and
struggles
and
necessities
but
in
its
firmament
for
ever
shines
the
starlight
of
divine
imaginings
shedding
upon
the
waves
of
restless
feeling
and
aspirations
for
the
undefined
the
glory
of
a
cloudless
hemisphere
o
stars
that
gaze
upon
me
from
on
high
like
angels
from
the
gates
of
paradise
that
weave
your
myriads
in
a
golden
chain
to
bind
creation
with
the
beautiful
as
locks
are
interrun
with
precious
gems
to
deck
a
queen
out
for
her
royalty
hear
me
ye
bright
ones
for
a
poet
love
and
let
light
fall
upon
my
swelling
soul
to
crest
each
rising
thought
with
purity
there
was
a
time
in
youth
ere
yet
the
sands
of
life
clogged
satiety
but
ran
lighter
than
blithe
rills
down
a
mountain
side
there
was
a
time
when
in
my
soul
a
voice
rang
faintly
like
a
huntsman
horn
afar
sounding
along
a
forest
and
i
arose
and
listed
as
the
bounding
antelope
starts
at
the
echo
of
a
falling
bough
louder
it
grew
and
clearer
search
for
it
what
it
melted
from
me
but
the
voice
still
came
then
up
i
gat
and
to
the
pressing
world
sped
on
the
wings
of
passion
striving
on
thro
pleasure
and
thro
pain
alike
unchecked
then
what
were
lets
to
me
amongst
the
strong
i
wrestled
for
ambition
upper
seats
clung
to
the
slippery
shrouds
of
policy
and
in
my
fury
prayed
for
eagle
wings
to
poize
me
in
the
shadow
of
the
sun
at
wealth
i
grasped
as
a
poor
crippled
wretch
grasps
at
the
crutch
that
steadies
him
along
yet
not
for
it
but
for
the
power
it
brought
for
within
my
heart
of
hearts
i
cursed
the
yellow
dust
i
trampled
on
but
by
the
wayside
i
sat
down
and
wept
as
a
child
weeps
above
some
shattered
toy
oh
misery
to
climb
the
steep
of
life
led
by
a
phantom
without
form
or
truth
to
find
reality
still
rising
up
to
crush
hope
fabrics
with
relentless
force
all
was
a
fiction
but
the
voice
said
search
and
glory
flashed
before
me
like
a
wisp
dazzling
me
on
to
bloodshed
and
to
strife
upon
the
field
i
stood
with
victory
and
death
in
all
its
ghastliness
around
the
dim
watchfires
stood
like
a
burning
wall
betwixt
the
dead
and
living
on
that
night
ye
saw
me
ye
pure
ministers
of
heaven
shone
on
my
anguish
and
my
bitter
tears
then
when
the
mangled
forms
of
with
hideous
passion
stiff
upon
their
lips
blanch
the
twilight
of
your
glimmering
oh
there
lay
one
beside
me
a
mere
youth
whose
dying
hands
had
pressed
unto
his
lips
a
long
fair
tress
through
which
his
dying
sigh
crept
as
in
happier
days
perchance
did
love
witness
ye
stars
of
my
abasement
then
judged
and
condemned
by
that
poor
lover
pledge
lying
there
like
a
messenger
of
heaven
breathing
of
peace
and
love
mid
deadly
hate
glory
thou
mirage
on
this
desert
life
charming
the
weary
on
to
water
springs
that
shrivel
up
to
barrenness
ere
reach
thou
shadow
of
a
shadow
that
departs
as
the
eye
scans
its
bodiless
outlines
thou
ruin
and
despair
when
this
earth
cracks
like
a
poor
blasted
rock
before
the
burning
of
almighty
wrath
thy
pallid
spectre
shall
rise
up
to
judge
the
wretched
victims
that
did
trust
in
thee
o
heaven
i
said
lead
me
to
love
and
peace
love
that
makes
all
things
calm
and
beautiful
and
like
the
sun
in
its
setting
flings
a
glory
the
cloudy
peaks
of
time
peace
that
doth
hush
the
throbbing
voice
of
life
till
through
the
stillness
of
the
poet
soul
the
echoes
of
seraphic
harmonies
float
like
a
spirit
through
the
blue
eterne
i
said
i
will
sit
neath
the
ancient
woods
and
list
unto
the
voices
of
the
winds
coming
from
far
spirit
lands
and
full
with
stolen
snatches
of
their
utterance
i
said
i
will
lay
bare
my
soul
unto
the
sun
and
let
its
glory
rest
there
till
it
charm
forth
from
its
womb
as
flowers
from
the
cold
ground
all
lovely
thoughts
and
high
imaginings
that
shed
sweet
perfume
the
waste
of
life
and
when
the
sickle
of
autumnal
time
gathereth
in
the
harvest
of
ripe
thought
nourish
and
strengthen
long
futurity
then
as
an
eagle
fleeth
to
his
crag
high
in
the
stillness
of
the
dim
cloudland
fled
i
from
man
into
the
trackless
woods
to
sate
my
soul
with
quietude
and
song
then
too
ye
saw
me
ye
pure
orbs
of
heaven
and
sent
your
blessed
radiance
to
my
heart
in
the
still
twilight
of
my
calm
content
then
came
an
answer
to
the
unseen
voice
o
holy
calmness
of
the
inner
soul
treasure
of
treasures
sweetness
of
all
sense
athwart
the
smoothness
of
whose
liquid
tide
floateth
the
spirit
of
eternal
love
tracing
a
pathway
to
the
thine
is
the
perfectness
of
earthly
bliss
the
brimming
of
life
chalice
with
peace
till
thro
all
thought
and
feeling
the
pure
draught
sheddeth
its
gladness
and
serenity
thine
is
a
joyance
passing
utterance
a
deep
delight
that
like
the
songs
of
heaven
swell
through
its
fulness
but
are
mute
without
thou
art
the
goal
of
most
sublime
desire
the
haven
that
all
longing
seeketh
for
where
shaded
from
the
storms
and
blasts
of
life
the
bark
glides
gently
down
the
stream
of
time
how
cloudless
is
this
azure
firmament
brighter
than
all
the
dreams
of
sinless
youth
deeper
than
the
deep
heart
of
woman
love
now
as
i
gaze
upon
each
shining
star
what
visions
steal
upon
me
with
its
rays
of
that
which
makes
its
glorious
excellence
can
there
be
revelation
of
high
truths
but
through
the
channels
of
weak
sense
alone
thus
like
a
fountain
thro
the
clay
or
doth
the
soul
hold
converse
spiritual
with
powers
unseen
that
fill
the
universe
receiving
as
by
intuition
things
that
man
attains
not
by
intelligence
is
not
the
spirit
perfect
in
itself
unmingled
with
the
base
alloy
of
earth
that
prisons
it
within
this
narrow
sphere
hath
it
not
apprehension
natural
attributive
as
immortality
unshackled
by
an
organ
that
will
die
beneath
the
friction
of
a
few
short
years
o
there
is
blindness
on
us
in
this
life
that
seeth
not
the
things
which
lie
around
in
the
circuit
of
our
littleness
but
death
will
loose
the
scales
from
off
our
eyes
and
smite
our
fleshly
dwelling
place
in
twain
freeing
the
spirit
till
with
joyous
wings
it
cleave
the
limits
of
immensity
yet
the
soul
will
shake
its
fetters
off
and
yearn
unto
the
freedom
of
the
skies
like
a
poor
bird
whose
life
is
liberty
yon
star
methinks
must
be
a
glorious
world
where
nature
hath
a
spiritual
life
and
bloometh
on
in
spring
perpetual
unsatiating
in
its
loveliness
verdure
of
herb
and
leafy
plenitude
spread
it
like
a
vesture
and
the
glow
of
sunlit
waters
smiling
from
afar
half
as
in
fancy
half
reality
the
skies
above
it
glassy
and
serene
as
the
reflection
of
its
own
repose
and
every
new
alternation
of
the
light
shedding
new
beauties
on
the
scene
below
thus
far
in
fashion
kin
to
earth
as
time
beareth
the
impress
of
eternity
but
differing
henceforth
as
the
gentle
dove
doth
from
the
vulture
on
its
carrion
the
dwellers
on
this
paradisal
sphere
methinks
must
be
of
glorious
lineament
clad
with
the
brightness
of
eternal
youth
and
buoyant
with
internal
blessedness
spirits
that
shining
with
untarnished
light
radiate
and
make
matter
luminous
filling
the
eyes
with
sweet
felicity
and
love
and
peace
and
all
emotions
pure
no
sorrow
there
to
make
the
vision
dim
and
wash
the
mellow
ripeness
from
the
cheek
no
guilty
deed
to
brand
the
heart
with
shame
and
write
its
direful
sentence
on
the
brow
no
rankling
venom
struggling
through
the
veins
and
blasting
all
the
kindliness
within
till
like
a
torrent
bursting
restraint
it
spread
its
desolation
on
mankind
but
a
pure
regnant
holiness
and
love
directing
impulse
with
most
queenly
sway
to
ends
of
tenderness
and
charity
a
nature
purified
by
fellowship
with
angels
and
bright
ministers
of
heaven
that
wander
thither
from
their
homes
above
on
missions
of
benignity
and
grace
and
in
this
pleasaunce
as
by
holy
need
there
reigneth
deep
communion
of
soul
that
frameth
as
it
were
one
atmosphere
of
joy
and
hope
and
blessedness
for
all
no
selfish
pleasures
fluttering
before
to
woo
satanic
emulation
forth
but
all
combining
for
one
common
weal
moved
still
by
sympathetic
influence
how
passing
beautiful
must
they
not
be
thus
dower
with
virtue
highest
attributes
that
from
the
spiritual
springeth
up
a
living
fount
of
light
and
loveliness
soul
is
the
life
of
beauty
as
the
sun
is
of
the
universe
it
luminates
o
what
were
matter
fashioned
so
fair
but
for
the
beaming
of
that
quenchless
light
that
plays
around
it
like
the
radiance
of
heaven
own
glory
stamped
upon
its
work
what
were
the
charm
of
the
soft
arching
brow
white
as
the
its
golden
braid
what
were
the
dimpled
cheek
with
roseate
shades
spread
it
like
the
budding
of
a
flower
the
lips
ripe
crimson
and
the
melting
eye
unbrightened
by
the
sunshine
from
within
the
emanations
of
seraphic
thought
and
full
emotion
kindling
into
life
light
grace
the
temple
that
they
glorify
oh
death
when
thou
dost
bear
the
soul
away
the
charm
is
shattered
the
illusion
gone
ay
they
are
beautiful
and
as
bright
forms
make
fair
the
mirrors
that
they
image
in
so
are
their
courses
glorious
and
glad
still
doth
their
swelling
harmony
ascend
in
thrilling
cadence
to
the
gates
of
heaven
making
the
air
about
them
sweet
with
joy
as
summer
breath
with
floral
incense
fumes
and
every
echo
learns
the
words
of
love
and
wonders
at
its
sweet
deliciousness
repeating
and
the
honied
tones
till
they
infuse
into
their
secret
souls
o
ye
bright
orbs
your
shining
would
be
dimmed
by
sin
and
all
its
pallid
consequence
till
scarce
a
glimmer
fluttered
on
the
sky
to
the
dreamer
to
your
sadden
sphere
but
ye
have
held
your
priceless
birthright
sure
and
walk
among
the
panoply
of
heaven
clear
and
as
the
sons
of
god
yet
may
we
gaze
upon
you
from
afar
as
the
unstained
gaze
on
the
innocent
lovely
and
peerless
in
their
purity
smitten
and
wondering
with
humbleness
of
that
which
is
your
everlasting
dower
quenching
within
us
pride
and
earthliness
before
the
glance
of
your
serenity
aspiring
ever
for
the
spirit
life
that
casting
off
this
fleshly
tenement
with
all
its
weakness
and
infirmities
entereth
on
the
cycle
of
the
just
unstained
immortal
glorious
and
strong
scene
grove
man
there
is
no
place
so
sweet
as
the
greenwoods
in
summer
heaven
and
earth
awake
with
sounds
melodial
the
ripple
of
the
breeze
amongst
the
leaves
and
pliant
boughs
just
like
the
rustle
of
young
summer
dress
the
songs
of
birds
and
the
low
mystic
hum
of
bees
amongst
their
floral
treasuries
sweetest
of
all
the
cool
and
liquid
tones
of
brooks
nature
bards
who
draw
bright
inspirations
from
a
pebbled
ridge
and
frame
them
into
sweetest
melody
there
poetry
in
every
pendent
leaf
if
we
could
read
them
truly
but
our
hearts
grow
strange
to
nature
language
in
the
world
nor
can
translate
their
heaven
lore
change
from
bud
to
ripeness
thence
again
to
sereness
and
decay
is
as
the
flow
of
a
short
tale
whose
moral
is
life
history
the
woods
were
made
for
poets
and
all
dreamers
men
who
philosophize
time
down
and
younger
grow
till
with
the
last
shot
sand
they
die
the
very
leaves
are
fanciful
and
write
their
maxims
on
the
sward
in
sun
and
shadow
here
i
lay
me
down
and
dream
an
hour
away
amongst
these
violets
o
my
heart
joys
to
gaze
upon
the
sky
gleaming
athwart
green
leaves
like
happiness
above
the
gloom
and
shadow
of
the
world
then
thought
first
feels
its
attribute
divine
and
like
a
callow
eagle
spreads
its
wings
and
makes
its
rest
amid
the
lumin
heavens
the
lark
sings
poized
above
me
in
the
sun
like
moslem
in
his
gilded
minaret
calling
the
faithful
unto
matin
prayer
there
would
my
spirit
follow
thee
sweet
bird
for
ever
in
the
midway
air
earth
shrouded
me
by
ascending
mists
and
cloudlets
like
the
base
of
bright
imagination
airy
halls
whose
roof
is
the
empyrean
thence
let
the
world
hear
my
full
gushing
joy
and
thrill
at
pleasures
they
can
never
know
hear
the
sweet
tumult
of
my
throbbing
breast
like
a
clear
spring
of
joyance
bubbling
up
and
overflowing
time
and
space
with
streams
whilst
i
wrapt
in
my
own
high
blessedness
drain
the
sweet
nectar
shareless
and
alone
spirit
the
lark
is
beauteous
in
its
skiey
home
amid
the
confluence
of
heaven
brightest
rays
singing
for
heaven
and
earth
undying
hymns
of
beauty
and
tenderness
but
more
when
sinking
on
its
own
sweet
song
it
flutter
jubilant
to
its
soft
nest
couched
in
the
lowly
bosom
of
the
earth
and
so
it
is
with
life
man
may
build
up
a
pillar
of
misanthropy
and
self
raising
him
above
his
kind
and
emulate
the
monumental
stone
in
coldness
and
indifference
but
in
the
paths
of
love
and
sympathy
and
lowly
charity
true
glory
lies
the
substance
of
all
joy
and
happiness
let
not
thy
spirit
spurn
man
fellowship
and
force
the
stream
of
kindness
up
life
steep
till
the
rocky
peaks
of
thought
it
flow
unmargined
by
the
verdant
bloom
of
act
shun
self
is
like
the
worm
a
rosy
bud
folds
in
its
young
embraces
till
it
gnaw
the
heart
out
nature
is
no
volume
writ
for
his
interpreting
who
measures
still
her
wisdom
by
the
inverted
standard
rule
of
his
own
barrenness
and
blind
conceit
there
not
a
flower
but
with
its
own
sweet
breath
cries
out
on
selfishness
the
while
it
gives
its
fragrant
treasures
to
the
summer
air
and
not
a

within

greenwood
shade
the
burden
of
whose
gentle
minstrelsie

not
of
love
and
joy
the
blest
of

they
whose
sympathies
are
free
to
all
as
streams
by
the
wayside
cheering
sustaining
by
their
limpid
tide
the
weary
and
the
footsore
of
the
earth
o
summer
sunshine
floating
round
all
things
meadow
and
hill
and
leafy
coverture
steeping
all
nature
in
most
sweet
delight
till
upward
from
the
bosom
of
the
earth
before
so
cold
and
blank
and
unadorned
spring
fairest
flowers
to
gladden
and
adore
that
fillest
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
with
smiles
as
of
a
mother
smiling
on
her
child
pure
holy
without
guile
or
artifice
melting
the
spirit
of
each
fleeting
cloud
from
darkness
unto
beauty
and
soft
grace
thou
art
the
emblem
of
that
perfect
love
that
sheddeth
joy
around
it
evermore
and
from
whose
sweetness
rise
all
gentle
thoughts
as
scent
from
vernal
flowers
that
in
the
heart
waketh
all
goodness
by
a
magic
spell
as
the
fine
touch
of
blindness
makes
a
page
start
into
instant
light
and
eloquence
cherish
thou
kindness
ever
for
this
life
would
be
most
blissful
if
its
sunshine
came
to
strengthen
on
endeavour
to
its
aim
man
methinks
there
is
no
blessedness
in
life
more
full
than
that
which
springs
in
solitude
a
fount
unruffled
by
the
outer
world
unmingled
with
its
honey
or
its
gall
but
welling
through
the
spirit
silently
like
a
pure
rill
within
a
garden
bounds
let
my
life
float
like
the
sad
indian
lamp
along
the
waves
of
time
unpiloted
save
by
the
breath
of
heaven
and
the
stirred
tide
till
when
its
course
be
run
it
sink
to
rest
beyond
the
ken
and
fathoming
of
man
let
me
not
be
a
legend
mouthed
about
by
empty
gossips
their
clinking
cups
who
tell
the
last
sad
tale
and
with
a
smack
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
passing
wine
something
to
be
wept
for
by
the
young
and
beautiful
but
tears
are
things
that
dry
sooner
than
dew
upon
the
waking
flowers
leaving
the
heart
gladder
for
their
flow
o
could
my
life
subside
into
a
dream
rising
amid
the
stillness
of
calm
sleep
filling
the
soul
with
radiant
images
of
love
and
grace
and
beauty
all
serene
and
shadowless
as
yon
blue
sky
is
now
would
that
the
outward
shows
and
forms
of
things
could
melt
away
from
cold
reality
to
the
warm
brightness
of
the
spiritual
losing
the
grossness
of
this
present
world
as
a
fair
face
doth
mirror
in
a
glass
and
thus
reposing
in
seraphic
trance
let
the
few
years
of
earth
existence
pass
like
minutes
in
the
quietness
of
sleep
and
waken
to
the
glorious
dawn
of
heaven
refreshed
and
scatheless
from
mortality
spirit
thy
wish
attain
would
brand
thee
deep
with
shame
life
was
not
made
to
rust
in
idle
sloth
until
the
canker
eat
its
gloss
away
but
like
a
falchion
to
grow
bright
with
use
and
hew
a
passage
to
eternal
bliss
canst
thou
stand
that
glory
of
the
sun
that
like
god
beacon
on
eternity
wakeneth
up
creation
unto
act
and
sheddeth
strength
and
hope
to
cheer
them
on
yet
cast
down
thine
untried
arms
ere
foes
assail
thee
or
thy
work
be
done
no
there
a
power
within
the
soul
that
yearns
for
action
as
the
lark
for
liberty
pursuing
ever
with
insatiate
thirst
and
aspiration
some
unsubstant
aim
there
is
assertion
of
the
rule
divine
that
rest
must
follow
labour
as
the
night
closeth
the
turmoil
of
the
wakeful
day
then
let
the
bright
sun
lead
thee
like
a
king
with
dauntless
heart
to
struggle
and
uncheck
by
mischance
or
poor
discontent
that
shrivels
up
a
monarch
to
a
clown
and
rends
his
purple
into
beggar
rags
let
no
alluring
plea
of
sensuous
ease
draw
thee
away
from
honour
rugged
path
till
sleep
fall
on
thee
from
the
wings
of
death
and
bear
thee
to
sweet
dreams
and
paradise
man
how
sweet
it
is
to
read
fair
nature
reclining
thus
upon
her
gentle
breast
like
a
young
child
that
in
her
mother
face
traceth
the
motions
of
deep
tenderness
listing
the
murmurs
of
strange
melodies
that
wander
ever
round
her
fresh
and
clear
whence
the
sweet
singers
of
our
earth
have
caught
rapt
harmonies
and
echoed
them
for
aye
what
study
is
like
nature
lumined
page
so
glorious
with
perfect
excellence
that
like
the
flowing
of
a
mighty
wind
it
fills
the
crevices
and
deeps
of
soul
no
upper
chamber
and
no
midnight
oil
for
me
to
throw
dim
light
upon
the
scroll
whose
feeble
pedantry
dulls
down
the
soul
from
high
imaginings
to
senseless
words
but
for
my
lamp
i
have
the
summer
sun
set
in
the
brightness
of
the
firmament
my
chamber
shall
be
canopied
by
heaven
gemmed
by
the
glory
of
the
fixëd
stars
and
round
it
floating
evermore
the
breath
of
nascent
flowers
and
fragrant
greenery
and
for
my
books
all
lovely
things
in
earth
and
air
and
heaven
all
seasons
and
all
times
the
spring
shall
bring
me
all
the
thoughts
of
youth
its
budding
hopes
and
buoyant
happiness
sing
me
lays
of
tenderness
and
love
that
are
the
first
sweet
flowers
of
childhood
days
and
win
me
back
to
purity
and
joy
with
the
untainted
current
of
its
breath
summer
will
be
the
volume
of
the
heart
expanded
with
the
strength
of
growing
life
swelling
with
full
brimm
feeling
evermore
and
power
and
passion
longing
to
be
forth
tell
of
life
quick
with
the
seed
of
thought
rising
incessant
into
bud
and
bloom
and
shedding
hope
and
promise
over
time
like
the
sweet
breath
that
tells
the
mariner
of
fragrant
shores
fast
rising
in
his
course
then
autumn
glorious
with
accomplishment
the
harvest
and
the
fruitage
of
the
past
stored
with
the
gladness
and
the
gain
of
life
or
sadden
by
its
unproductiveness
and
winter
like
a
prophecy
would
come
to
warn
me
of
the
end
that
draweth
nigh
each
falling
leaf
that
flutter
from
its
bough
pale
with
the
sereness
of
frosts
would
teach
me
that
the
ties
of
earth
must
loose
one
after
one
the
interests
and
joys
that
made
life
excellent
completeness
up
until
the
trunk
stripped
of
its
verdant
dress
stand
in
the
naked
dreadfulness
of
death
thus
will
my
soul
learn
wisdom
true
and
deep
not
in
the
school
of
petty
prejudice
where
truth
is
measured
out
by
interest
and
duty
shrinks
into
expediency
not
in
the
volumes
of
pedantic
fools
who
bind
up
knowledge
with
terms
that
sunder
the
enclosure
turns
to
dust
not
in
the
false
philosophy
of
man
who
speculates
on
causes
and
effects
yet
thrusts
his
hand
into
the
scorching
flame
and
wonders
that
it
singeth
in
the
act
but
from
her
teaching
who
can
never
err
the
pure
the
beautiful
the
mother
mind
that
in
the
fulness
of
her
unsearch
soul
shrineth
all
knowledge
and
all
loveliness
spirit
ay
there
are
lessons
of
true
wisdom
writ
in
every
page
of
nature
from
the
flower
man
treads
beneath
him
as
he
wanders
past
the
humblest
and
the
weakest
thing
of
earth
yet
with
its
sweet
breath
rising
on
the
air
to
make
the
fragrance
of
the
summer
full
up
to
the
rattle
of
the
thunder
cloud
the
voice
of
heaven
heard
rolling
through
the
spheres
till
earth
is
dumb
and
stricken
at
the
sound
then
let
thy
heart
lean
to
them
reverently
knowing
that
action
is
the
end
of
thought
and
thus
from
nature
bring
thou
precepts
still
to
guide
thee
nobly
through
this
pilgrim
world
one
deed
wrought
out
in
holiness
and
love
is
richer
than
all
vain
imaginings
let
then
her
lore
fulfil
thee
evermore
and
like
high
inspiration
send
thee
forth
to
prophecy
aloud
unto
mankind
of
love
and
peace
and
verity
sublime
let
not
disaster
daunt
thee
nor
reproach
no
feeble
yelpings
of
the
toothless
curs
that
follow
on
the
heels
of
all
who
walk
the
highways
of
this
world
in
faithfulness
and
strength
but
like
a
wild
swan
on
the
wave
let
every
billow
swelling
round
thy
breast
raise
thee
in
spirit
nigher
unto
heaven
scene
grove
man
o
earth
is
beautiful
in
such
a
scene
the
everlasting
curse
that
sin
entailed
strikes
on
the
heart
by
contrast
as
though
heaven
rolled
back
its
portals
till
the
holy
wrath
of
god
burst
on
creation
all
is
still
save
the
rapt
nightingale
that
sings
to
rest
earth
warring
multitudes
and
this
bright
rill
whose
voice
is
eloquent
as
poesy
the
very
breeze
is
hush
that
stirr
the
leaves
to
pleasure
and
the
golden
clouds
float
on
as
though
an
angel
steered
them
the
plain
of
heaven
it
is
a
blessed
thing
to
feel
the
melody
of
silence
in
the
woods
when
outer
life
is
hushed
and
in
the
heart
the
echo
of
its
murmurous
sweetness
sounds
as
in
the
pauses
of
a
song
the
harp
still
vibrates
is
a
test
by
which
the
soul
lies
open
unto
nature
for
its
frame
impure
or
guilty
unto
discord
turns
those
tones
of
peace
and
harmony
perchance
these
woods
heard
the
voice
of
man
till
now
nor
know
the
motion
of
his
jarring
thoughts
i
feel
the
weight
of
judgment
my
head
if
i
bring
the
brand
of
guilt
on
this
unfallen
paradise
in
sooth
this
scene
is
rich
in
eden
loveliness
and
peace
and
the
rude
din
of
jabbering
crowds
unheard
as
when
earth
generations
yet
lay
in
the
womb
of
time
how
soft
the
air
breathes
with
the
scent
of
which
the
dew
hangs
like
a
charm
of
sweetness
ah
fair
earth
is
sad
to
die
and
leave
thee
for
heaven
yet
the
blue
sky
above
is
glorious
and
brings
the
spirit
visions
of
bright
scenes
yet
lovelier
than
this
there
is
a
veil
of
dreamy
beauty
it
from
whose
woof
the
mystic
glimmer
like
a
bride
in
such
an
hour
peace
steals
upon
the
soul
like
the
soft
twilight
the
toiling
world
there
is
no
room
for
passion
strife
would
blush
as
at
the
chiding
of
a
gentle
glance
spirit
eve
brings
forth
bright
thoughts
from
the
soul
like
stars
from
the
blue
heavens
its
sweet
serenity
is
as
a
boon
of
mercy
from
above
restoring
rest
unto
a
world
dost
thou
not
turn
from
this
to
the
pure
calm
of
heaven
as
by
a
spell
man
ay
yonder
cloud
bright
with
the
last
faint
glances
of
the
sun
bears
my
soul
thither
spirit
all
the
beautiful
points
like
the
magnetically
to
heaven
where
beauty
is
accomplish
earth
is
but
the
reproduction
of
one
form
whose
perfectness
is
heaven
and
thus
the
mind
unblinded
by
the
blighting
mist
of
sin
sees
emblems
of
its
everlasting
hope
in
nature
loveliness
this
quiet
hour
when
the
calm
heart
cries
truce
unto
itself
and
lays
the
weapons
of
resentment
down
and
bitterness
and
anger
yields
the
bliss
that
in
completeness
is
the
bliss
of
heaven
the
earth
is
so
sweet
as
when
it
seems
by
intuition
to
the
soul
like
heaven
and
in
the
spirit
earthliness
dissolves
like
mist
before
the
sunshine
man
there
a
power
within
the
soul
that
makes
it
yearn
to
soar
up
to
the
infinite
and
bask
in
the
unveiled
glory
of
the
sun
but
this
frame
clogs
its
aspirations
all
like
gyves
that
press
the
struggling
captive
down
tell
me
of
other
worlds
spirit
there
is
a
world
bright
as
yon
star
that
flecks
the
wing
of
night
and
sheds
its
glory
the
universe
made
up
of
such
pure
loveliness
within
that
like
a
gem
it
glistens
through
the
crust
and
makes
heaven
luminous
a
chasten
sound
of
never
failing
melody
still
floats
about
it
like
an
ocean
undulating
to
the
sweet
breath
of
summer
scented
airs
from
hill
to
dale
and
woods
that
catch
the
humours
of
the
golden
sun
and
deck
them
in
his
livery
there
falls
from
the
soft
twilight
gloom
of
sparry
grots
and
crystal
pillar
caverns
many
a
stream
that
breaks
in
light
and
music
on
the
soul
and
like
a
spirit
glides
in
beauty
through
the
land
margined
by
flowers
that
mirror
in
its
tide
and
seem
like
stars
in
heaven
there
are
flowers
everywhere
in
vale
and
woodland
in
the
sun
and
shade
that
whether
dreams
be
on
them
or
they
wake
send
evermore
sweet
incense
to
the
heavens
mountains
softened
into
grace
by
the
blue
tints
of
distance
lend
new
charms
to
verdant
swarded
valleys
in
whose
lap
as
in
a
mother
bosom
waters
lie
and
ripple
to
the
wooing
of
the
winds
the
very
clouds
that
scan
the
blue
of
heaven
fused
sometimes
by
the
sunshine
as
with
soul
or
flaked
by
the
light
fancies
of
the
gale
form
to
the
vision
labyrinths
of
grace
and
beauty
that
melt
into
space
and
spread
a
hemisphere
of
magic
the
orb
and
thro
this
world
at
morning
noon
and
night
a
dreamy
sweetness
wanders
varying
from
blessing
unto
blessing
that
the
sense
of
pleasure
dull
not
with
satiety
man
and
it
is
habited
spirit
by
beings
framed
after
the
model
of
all
perfectness
in
some
the
majesty
of
strength
sublime
rejoicing
on
the
nervous
power
of
life
like
the
broad
noontide
sun
with
glances
bold
and
open
as
the
soul
lies
unto
god
and
brows
that
thought
wreathes
with
a
glorious
crown
of
fadeless
immortality
which
shines
like
lightning
playing
round
the
arc
of
heaven
and
some
there
are
as
gentle
and
as
fair
as
flowers
made
animate
whose
motions
are
more
graceful
than
the
sweep
of
evening
gales
moonlit
waters
and
whose
beauty
fills
the
air
they
breathe
with
sweetness
and
to
life
is
what
the
sunshine
is
to
summer
all
are
filled
with
deathless
spirits
capable
of
joy
and
love
and
holiness
that
make
together
heaven
felicity
the
strong
tho
they
be
trenchëd
round
with
mighty
thoughts
without
one
breach
for
weakness
in
their
souls
feel
the
sweet
want
for
love
pure
tenderness
that
like
the
dew
may
soothe
the
eagle
breast
and
send
it
soaring
nigher
to
the
sun
thus
to
their
lives
they
graft
the
fragile
blossom
whose
sweetness
is
an
amulet
to
lay
life
else

so
that
all

star
and
dash
it
from
its
orbit
till
it
flew
through

eternally
and
whelmed
myriads
of
spheres
in
flaming
ruin
yet
can
not
consummate
that
which
is
so
light
one

emancipation
from

clod
to
wander
thro
such
worlds
which
brightest
orb

listen
in
this

there
works
a
mighty
power
of
evil
conjured
there
by
acts

a
standard
of
rebellion
against

and
whirls
a

tide
of
interest

pleasure
to
suck
souls
unto
itself
the

to
sterilize

still
there

a
virtue

into

there
no
joy
like
that
of
danger
met
and
danger
overcome
the
soul
is
like
a
sword
that
rusts
to
lie
inglorious
in
its
scabbard
but
will
flash
bright
as
the
lightning
in
the
battle
field
spirit
will
death
transport
to
such
a
world
spirit
thou
art
upon
it
it
is
earth
itself
all
lovely
but
man
soul
so
warped
and
blind
he
scarce
can
see
her
beauty
but
still
scans
the
stars
of
heaven
for
that
which
lies
displayed
beneath
his
feet
the
heart
rears
phantoms
up
to
overthrow
reality
and
make
intention
stand
for
act
is
well
to
boast
of
spirit
warfare
in
another
sphere
yet
like
a
craven
slight
the
trumpet
call
that
bids
man
up
and
strive
in
this
in
life
there
is
a
struggle
evermore
wherein
the
spirit
grapples
with
such
subtle
foes
that
victory
is
glory
infinite
no
crumbling
stone
to
whet
ambition
on
that
the
sapping
of
one
wave
of
time
melts
to
the
substance
of
oblivion
it
is
nobility
to
walk
through
life
with
a
stout
heart
and
cheerful
courage
on
to
look
on
sorrow
with
undaunted
mien
and
smile
away
the
fears
that
trouble
brings
to
bear
unto
the
stricken
solace
sweet
as
water
to
the
wounded
and
to
be
a
strength
and
an
assurance
to
the
weak
ay
life
like
matter
is
atomic
and
man
blows
unto
the
winds
what
multiplied
makes
up
the
universe
this
radiant
earth
which
in
its
penitential
moods
the
heart
feels
were
a
paradise
if
guilt
were
not
sprung
from
the
womb
of
space
in
perfectness
with
the
fairest
orb
that
holds
in
heaven
for
the
sun
form
substance
seeming
and
that
vivid
charm
which
is
the
soul
of
matter
like
in
each
mind
differs
only
making
fair
seem
dull
with
what
it
glances
through
and
thus
yon
star
viewed
with
man
callous
nature
would
resolve
into
reality
as
cold
as
earth
o
earth
thou
beauty
and
thou
wonderful
that
from
thy
bosom
like
a
living
womb
bringest
all
forms
of
loveliness
and
grace
into
the
gladness
of
the
summer
air
that
givest
to
the
winds
that
are
the
breath
and
heaving
of
thy
passion
wingëd
thoughts
to
root
into
the
ground
and
spring
bud
blossom
nourish
ever
by
young
showers
and
dews
until
they
make
thine
utterance
odorous
that
from
thy
soul
as
from
an
unseen
presence
of
divinest
light
dartest
into
the
spirit
subtle
rays
that
quicken
life
to
blessing
as
the
breath
of
being
stirreth
the
inanimate
making
existence
joy
and
love
and
power
o
woods
and
rustling
forests
ye
that
send
soft
murmurs
ever
to
the
ends
of
heaven
and
from
your
breast
as
from
a
poet
soul
issue
all
sweetest
melodies
of
birds
and
leafy
eloquence
o
springs
and
streams
blithe
hearted
wanderers
throughout
the
earth
tracing
your
footsteps
still
with
flowers
that
rise
like
stars
beneath
the
feet
of
night
o
hills
o
mighty
mountains
round
whose
hoary
brows
gather
the
mystic
clouds
of
heaven
like
thoughts
of
unimagined
wisdom
that
are
rocked
to
slumber
by
the
hurricanes
sons
of
destruction
and
whose
waking
voice
is
the
eternal
thunder
o
wide
ocean
swelling
for
ever
with
the
mighty
throes
of
nature
agony
and
ceaseless
act
emblem
of
time
and
of
eternity
time
the
great
worker
the
implacable
that
with
the
roll
of
human
will
and
deed
and
hopes
and
joys
and
shatter
purposes
dashes
relentless
on
eternity
the
pauseless
the
insatiate
the
gulf
whereto
all
motion
all
existence
flows
enters
and
ends
o
sunshine
and
cool
shade
and
all
that
makes
earth
beautiful
and
sweet
soft
moonlight
life
pure
maidenhood
whose
dreams
are
gleams
of
antenatal
blessedness
witness
for
earth
equality
and
bid
the
sister
orbs
of
heaven
cry
hail
to
her
man
o
mother
earth
methinks
i
hear
a
voice
sound
the
surging
of
the
stars
of
heaven
like
a
clear
trump
athwart
the
mighty
roar
of
falling
waters
oh
thou
beautiful
frail
daughter
of
immensity
that
hangest
upon
the
bosom
of
dim
night
at
once
a
glory
and
a
brightness
and
a
shame
that
from
the
urn
of
everlasting
love
drinkest
of
light
and
immortality
like
a
fair
child
in
waywardness
and
mirth
triumphing
in
her
loveliness
the
swell
of
thy
rapt
harmonies
is
mute
in
heaven
that
once
rang
through
the
arches
of
all
space
a
wonder
and
an
ecstasy
but
still
thy
path
is
with
the
glorious
and
pure
spanning
the
empyrean
with
a
jewelled
zone
making
heaven
beautiful
and
with
thy
grace
charming
to
goodness
though
thou
act
it
not
arise
o
lovely
fondling
of
the
skies
wake
from
the
silence
of
thy
fallen
doom
breathe
forth
thy
sweetness
to
the
longing
air
the
angels
are
about
thee
evermore
like
watchers
a
stricken
one
that
hold
a
glass
to
catch
the
from
her
lips
arise
and
don
thy
bridal
vestments
pure
and
lead
the
train
of
heaven
to
the
morn
art
thou
not
beautiful
daughter
of
heaven
beautiful
as
a
bride
before
the
sun
gliding
along
the
blue
serene
of
space
pensive
and
glorious
showering
soft
light
upon
the
path
of
heaven
as
from
the
eyes
of
cherubim
arise
stand
in
the
light
of
lights
and
bare
thy
soul
unto
the
searching
of
the
undimmed
spheres
o
spirit
are
there
angels
hovering
now
in
the
dim
ocean
of
this
twilight
air
spirit
there
are
pure
angels
ever
round
the
earth
as
stars
are
round
the
azure
dome
of
heaven
in
sunshine
and
in
twilight
and
in
gloom
that
with
the
sweetness
of
an
unseen
love
circle
humanity
and
like
the
lark
hid
in
the
glory
of
the
noonday
sun
pour
the
world
heaven
constant
tenderness
some
in
the
glimmering
of
dreams
through
the
unfolded
lattices
of
sleep
steal
to
the
soul
in
visions
of
delight
pure
and
benignant
as
the
evening
dew
that
cools
the
bosom
of
the
blushing
rose
some
all
unseen
save
in
the
blessed
care
that
like
a
lover
arm
from
life
rough
way
presses
the
serried
thorns
that
choke
it
up
but
all
as
with
an
atmosphere
of
love
and
peace
and
strength
encircling
man
alike
within
him
and
without
that
the
foul
breath
of
pestilent
corruption
touch
him
not
some
are
there
who
have
loved
and
suffered
much
for
earth
as
a
fond
mother
doth
who
sees
her
babe
die
in
her
bosom
who
have
traced
man
to
the
precipital
brink
of
ruin
with
open
arms
to
charm
him
back
from
death
rejected
and
despised
who
on
the
scroll
of
conscience
as
with
words
of
living
light
stamp
the
pure
precepts
of
a
holy
lore
that
sin
obliterates
and
sets
at
naught
man
oh
how
polluted
must
man
spirit
show
in
contrast
with
these
ministers
of
heaven
that
beneath
frail
woman
purity
dims
like
a
taper
the
light
of
day
methinks
if
from
our
eyes
sin
blindness
fell
and
gave
pure
angels
to
our
ravish
sight
gliding
around
us
clad
in
the
bright
robes
of
love
and
immortality
this
earth
would
be
like
heaven
o
a
blessed
change
and
perfect
as
when
death
exulting
sigh
swoons
through
the
empty
chambers
of
the
soul
his
note
of
liberty
spirit
is
man
alone
makes
earth
less
paradise
its
frame
is
full
of
perfect
blessedness
which
to
the
pure
were
heaven
in
all
its
fulness
but
mankind
are
crimsoned
with
sin
which
like
a
soundless
ocean
could
not
cleanse
away
and
thus
all
flesh
must
thaw
back
to
the
dust
from
which
it
sprang
as
ice
doth
unto
water
before
the
soul
is
purified
for
heaven
men
little
dream
how
near
heaven
is
to
them
in
possibility
how
far
in
deed
as
little
as
they
dream
amid
their
mirth
death
stalks
beside
them
that
his
shadow
falls
in
the
same
mirror
where
the
maiden
sees
the
image
of
her
loveliness
and
flits
amongst
the
whirl
of
revelry
and
show
scene
rock
overhanging
the
man
a
rock
and
the
wild
waters
is
a
spot
to
moralize
on
life
and
strip
the
world
of
all
its
gaudy
trappings
and
false
gloss
that
like
the
daubing
on
a
wanton
cheek
crimsons
the
paleness
of
disease
and
shame
and
with
life
semblance
mocks
a
rotten
heart
o
wild
wild
sea
eternal
wilderness
of
strife
and
toil
and
fruitless
energy
birthplace
and
tomb
whence
unto
being
spring
successive
myriads
to
run
their
race
rage
labour
and
grow
hoar
then
pass
away
with
all
their
deeds
and
memories
and
cede
their
petty
sphere
of
inches
to
another
o
wild
wild
sea
thou
bosom
of
all
passion
and
thought
and
hope
and
longing
infinite
that
struggling
ever
from
the
riven
caves
and
fathomless
abysses
of
the
earth
as
from
the
cells
of
an
awakened
soul
fling
your
hoarse
murmurs
and
aspiring
groans
to
the
strong
wingëd
winds
that
puff
them
on
in
sport
and
in
derision
that
art
stirred
to
tumult
and
to
madness
by
the
breath
of
unseen
currents
unsubstantial
air
that
passes
on
and
leaves
a
foaming
train
to
wonder
at
the
thing
that
angered
them
o
wild
wild
sea
soul
of
indifference
lashing
eternally
the
rifted
sands
and
lonely
shores
about
ye
swallowing
the
wreck
of
man
dependence
and
the
life
that
struggles
with
ye
for
the
prize
of
love
and
joy
and
sorrow
clinging
round
its
soul
that
flowest
on
in
coldness
and
the
dissolving
frames
of
countless
waves
that
sink
like
generations
and
so
rise
pausing
or
stilling
never
up
a
myriad
selfish
interests
to
make
thy
sum
of
being
perfect
man
may
read
the
lore
of
human
nature
in
thee
writ
not
with
the
pen
of
flattery
that
gilds
the
base
past
recognition
but
all
plain
and
coloured
only
by
its
truthfulness
the
good
and
ill
alike
displayed
that
lie
within
the
sounding
of
its
inmost
soul
o
thought
might
wander
this
briny
waste
without
one
ark
whereon
to
rest
from
the
interminable
ebb
and
flow
as
many
a
soul
has
flutter
the
earth
weary
and
faint
as
mine
did
till
it
found
a
haven
in
the
bosom
of
sweet
love
spirit
then
thou
hast
loved
man
ay
so
that
life
is
bound
about
by
it
as
by
a
gordian
knot
inseparable
until
death
sharp
blade
divide
its
inmost
coil
there
is
a
time
when
all
that
sweeten
youth
and
childhood
dulls
and
fades
to
nothingness
as
the
faint
moon
pales
at
the
bright
foreshadowing
of
morn
and
leaves
heaven
void
when
every
chord
is
dumb
that
once
made
music
in
the
soul
and
life
is
still
and
silent
though
it
be
the
pause
that
presages
the
storm
and
bitter
strife
whose
fury
ofttimes
bends
the
spirit
down
and
strips
it
of
its
blossoms
then
to
me
the
blank
chaos
of
my
being
came
as
from
the
haunted
chambers
of
deep
thought
a
glorious
presence
an
imagined
grace
whose
footfalls
as
she
rose
pulsed
thro
my
heart
with
tremblings
exquisite
it
was
sweet
love
the
blessed
the
indwelling
that
doth
make
a
virgin
firmament
for
its
pure
light
then
at
the
pleading
of
its
own
deep
want
shines
forth
in
glory
and
in
tenderness
amongst
the
laughing
and
the
gay
i
went
seeking
for
one
to
realize
love
dream
as
mid
the
countless
hosts
of
heaven
the
sage
peers
for
the
brightness
of
a
star
then
soft
hands
trembled
in
my
palm
and
forms
graceful
and
rounded
with
the
bloom
of
youth
flitted
about
me
in
the
languishment
of
music
and
sweet
motion
voices
low
and
modulate
from
laughter
unto
sadness
hung
on
the
air
like
perfume
on
the
wind
and
eyes
flashing
and
mild
and
fond
spake
too
a
very
babel
of
soft
speech
and
yet
i
sighed
life
seemed
to
me
a
painted
daub
all
glare
and
show
and
tinsel
where
the
eye
in
vain
sought
some
green
spot
to
rest
on
till
a
mist
swam
it
as
in
gazing
at
the
sun
spirit
man
ofttimes
palms
an
artificial
life
upon
the
heart
for
that
which
is
the
true
though
to
the
real
it
be
what
a
flower
is
to
its
mimicry
a
tinted
rag
unsweetened
by
the
breath
of
summer
love
joy
flows
alone
from
an
spring
unstirred
by
the
false
whirl
of
giddy
dreams
that
send
the
dregs
of
passion
through
its
veins
amid
that
gay
assemblage
many
wore
perchance
a
laughing
vizard
a
heart
empty
and
sad
many
a
vacant
smile
like
a
upon
the
winter
snow
that
freezes
yet
beneath
it
some
there
were
who
flutter
round
its
glitter
like
a
moth
that
takes
a
petty
for
the
sun
and
few
who
let
the
honest
heart
appear
unveiled
mid
fashion
frigid
masquerade
didst
thou
look
deeper
than
the
outward
guise
man
ay
some
there
were
so
lovely
that
the
eye
dreamt
of
them
in
its
night
when
they
were
gone
but
when
i
search
them
like
a
single
flower
the
outer
blossoms
parted
and
showed
nought
within
oh
then
i
fled
as
one
whose
own
wild
thoughts
bid
him
outstrip
the
curbless
winds
of
heaven
and
storm
the
bulwarks
of
sublime
desire
want
grew
within
me
as
a
famine
grows
with
every
hour
that
fleets
unsatisfied
but
in
my
wanderings
there
rose
a
spot
where
man
had
wrought
pure
nature
counsel
out
nor
reared
a
shrine
to
mock
her
loveliness
yet
this
i
heeded
not
for
there
was
one
who
came
to
me
on
sudden
with
such
joy
that
i
stirred
not
but
like
one
weak
with
thirst
let
the
life
draught
flow
my
powerless
lips
o
yet
i
see
her
with
those
blessed
eyes
slaying
my
soul
with
beauty
eyes
so
deep
that
in
their
azure
ocean
of
soft
light
thought
shrank
into
a
fathom
length
and
smiles
stealing
their
sweetness
from
a
heaven
of
love
and
joy
and
immortality
within
whence
all
emotion
came
forth
clad
in
a
vesture
of
celestial
light
her
face
beamed
on
me
like
a
glimpse
of
heaven
caught
in
the
rapture
of
prophetic
trance
that
in
all
thoughts
and
shaded
dreams
haunts
the
deep
soul
for
ever
as
she
went
grace
lapt
its
mantle
her
like
the
gold
on
clouds
in
sunny
skies
o
spirit
she
was
beautiful
a
thing
guileless
and
pure
as
though
her
youth
had
past
with
heaven
own
children
in
the
light
of
god
thence
come
to
make
a
paradise
of
earth
and
breathe
the
transports
of
transcendant
bliss
like
floral
exhalations
through
my
soul
and
i
i
loved
her
with
the
love
of
heaven
that
melts
down
time
and
space
and
all
between
and
clasps
an
essence
in
the
soul
embrace
and
from
her
being
there
would
ever
flow
full
streams
of
holy
melody
that
lapt
earth
air
and
heaven
and
all
terrestrial
forms
with
charms
bright
as
heaven
light
and
as
she
gazed
on
the
blue
firmament
and
shrined
the
stars
with
her
pure
thoughts
and
dreamt
of
that
which
lay
beyond
i
gazed
on
her
and
drew
elysian
theories
of
heaven
as
though
borne
thither
by
wing
seraphims
oh
what
is
there
in
love
that
wreathes
all
things
with
an
unfading
halo
of
sweet
light
making
the
mystery
of
nature
clear
spirit
love
like
the
sun
clears
from
the
soul
all
clouds
that
darken
understanding
and
wrap
earth
round
with
a
misty
curtain
through
whose
folds
the
lineaments
of
beauty
glimmer
forth
in
undefined
luxuriance
is
a
spell
that
brings
by
sympathetic
influence
the
glory
from
the
universe
all
things
are
beautiful
to
those
who
love
whether
in
mind
or
matter
life
becomes
a
pathway
of
soft
light
and
radiance
whereon
the
spirit
glideth
unto
heaven
as
angels
up
the
sunshine
thought
and
deed
are
blessed
in
the
framing
and
the
act
fashioned
and
temper
with
pure
charity
that
knits
man
unto
man
and
grants
the
weak
exemption
from
the
thraldom
of
the
strong
and
things
inanimate
that
yet
are
pierced
through
with
the
spirit
of
eternal
love
as
with
a
life
that
circulates
and
glows
in
ruddy
currents
throughout
all
their
frame
by
gracious
intuition
stand
revealed
in
all
the
plenitude
of
eden
charms
then
nature
language
reaches
to
the
heart
as
through
the
modulations
of
a
song
sweet
thoughts
flow
the
spirit
what
was
fair
seems
fairer
what
was
vividless
grows
bright
man
ay
she
made
all
things
beautiful
to
me
drawing
with
youth
pure
privilege
the
sting
of
guilt
and
wrong
from
life
was
as
the
sun
rose
on
a
sphere
seen
but
by
night
before
ah
bitter
image
of
a
transient
thing
that
shineth
with
promethean
glory
then
sinks
the
shadow
of
eternity
oh
spirit
day
by
day
i
saw
her
fade
the
life
within
her
grew
more
spiritual
triumphing
in
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
and
in
her
eyes
supernal
brightness
shone
as
from
the
glory
of
approaching
heaven
dear
child
that
kisses
could
not
keep
awake
or
woo
from
the
sweet
love
of
she
lay
within
these
arms
and
angels
came
and
whispered
her
away
with
them
to
heaven
so
softly
that
i
knew
it
not
but
still
murmured
my
heart
to
her
to
sense
she
lay
upon
my
breast
and
yet
she
was
in
heaven
this
but
the
earthly
mantle
she
had
shed
there
were
those
silken
locks
that
curtained
her
and
her
sweet
lips
that
i
had
kissed
but
now
from
whence
as
from
a
living
spring
of
love
trickled
pure
heaven
streams
my
life
dull
waste
but
oh
i
kissed
the
soft
lids
from
her
eyes
and
knew
my
desolation
for
the
soul
that
was
their
soul
as
light
is
day
no
more
stood
in
their
dewy
portals
like
a
queen
swaying
multitudes
oh
heaven
was
wonderful
to
fold
her
thus
unto
me
with
life
ripe
bloom
upon
her
cheeks
and
grace
clinging
round
her
like
a
bridal
robe
yet
feel
that
she
the
verity
the
self
was
floating
on
the
stream
of
souls
to
god
oh
mind
is
ever
thus
with
thee
thou
graspest
at
material
shadowings
whilst
that
the
immaterial
substance
of
all
good
flies
from
thee
like
a
vapour
from
the
wind
so
that
thou
hast
a
clod
within
thine
hand
life
seems
eternal
till
the
crumbling
dust
runs
through
thy
clenching
fingers
and
thy
gage
mocks
thee
up
from
the
frame
of
earth
there
is
no
mystery
like
death
it
comes
sightless
as
the
first
breath
of
infant
life
and
goes
to
an
unsearched
eternity
the
end
and
the
beginning
are
alike
spirit
death
strikes
upon
the
soul
the
last
deep
chime
that
tells
it
time
short
hour
has
passed
away
eternity
undialled
course
begun
there
is
a
trackless
ocean
round
this
life
whose
tide
is
tremulous
with
unseen
gales
and
storms
that
lash
it
off
to
fury
shades
of
deep
chaotic
darkness
ever
hang
above
it
like
the
thunder
crags
of
heaven
and
sounds
as
of
the
swooning
of
a
blast
through
caverns
flap
their
heavy
wings
on
the
white
foam
crest
of
the
surging
waves
o
man
that
standest
on
the
pinnacle
of
life
abysmal
heights
with
failing
heart
and
reeling
brain
gaze
on
that
troubled
gulf
it
is
thy
pathway
to
the
which
thou
must
traverse
with
a
flight
whose
rest
is
on
the
bosom
of
the
storm
ay
is
a
fearful
plunge
now
think
of
death
there
is
an
angel
merciful
and
strong
hovering
ever
the
weary
world
that
foldeth
in
his
arms
the
weak
whose
feet
totter
upon
the
brink
of
the
inane
and
like
a
mother
wafts
them
from
earth
strife
into
the
bosom
of
eternal
rest
is
he
not
merciful
who
spares
so
long
the
guilty
for
repentance
and
the
pure
transplants
in
all
their
purity
to
heaven
death
harms
not
aught
that
lovely
that
poor
frame
is
mere
corruption
which
the
soul
makes
fair
by
luminous
infusion
and
the
soul
feels
not
death
breathing
on
its
healthful
bloom
but
like
a
virgin
doffs
its
earthly
veil
and
gives
its
fullest
beauty
to
the
light
man
o
spirit
tell
me
shall
we
meet
again
as
those
who
have
loved
well
in
time
or
drop
all
memories
of
earth
with
the
sad
dust
the
soul
shakes
from
it
at
the
gate
of
heaven
bitter
to
regard
her
angel
there
unknown
and
lost
amid
the
myriad
host
of
spirits
glorified
spirit
the
soul
is
wrought
in
an
eternal
mould
which
still
remains
unscathed
the
vicissitudes
of
flesh
and
the
same
power
that
makes
identity
man
and
man
being
the
soul
within
that
constitutes
the
of
every
man
bears
its
distinctive
features
when
it
sheds
the
crysalis
of
frail
humanity
they
who
have
loved
on
earth
will
love
in
heaven
through
each
the
current
flowing
unto
god
thence
shed
again
in
blessing
on
their
souls
as
from
clear
tided
springs
a
summer
cloud
gathers
its
dewy
freight
to
yield
again
in
sunny
showers
upon
the
native
earth
true
love
is
earth
blest
blessedness
all
else
wealth
fame
nobility
and
the
poor
gauds
wherewith
man
trinkets
out
his
little
life
end
with
the
dust
that
rattles
on
his
bier
but
love
like
a
rich
heritage
ascends
with
the
freed
spirit
to
the
throne
of
god
there
to
be
perfected
and
purified
to
commune
with
the
children
of
the
light
therefore
love
much
on
earth
keeping
the
heart
pure
from
the
rank
pollutions
of
the
flesh
that
like
a
bank
hangs
loose
above
to
launch
its
filth
upon
each
errant
wave
let
thy
love
circle
wider
with
all
time
like
the
light
ripple
round
a
pebble
plunge
wider
and
wider
till
the
swells
subside
in
the
calm
fulness
of
eternity
the
love
of
heaven
flows
in
stream
to
god
as
from
a
fountain
unison
of
soul
wherein
all
spirits
blend
inseparably
there
is
no
isolation
but
in
time
for
death
that
units
out
mortality
like
minutes
on
a
dial
now
will
break
his
arrows
the
ruins
of
the
earth
proclaiming
life
and
love
the
consummation
of
all
unity
scene
and
dale
man
the
breath
of
morn
is
stealing
my
brow
all
redolent
of
life
and
health
and
joy
as
the
first
breeze
that
fans
the
prisoner
cheeks
and
welcomes
him
to
liberty
the
earth
is
yet
in
her
sweet
childhood
innocence
ere
the
dark
cloud
of
worldly
interests
obscure
her
taintless
heavens
and
the
blue
mist
which
is
the
spirit
of
the
rising
dew
hangs
it
like
the
sadness
of
first
love
that
makes
youth
beautiful
the
lark
is
up
and
singing
like
a
disembodied
soul
within
the
brightness
of
the
blessed
sun
telling
of
naught
but
heaven
and
happiness
there
is
no
dew
upon
her
bosom
now
for
the
young
beams
have
kissed
it
utterly
yet
over
flower
and
bud
and
blade
there
lies
the
crystal
tissue
trembling
with
soft
light
as
the
young
day
moves
gaily
up
the
sky
and
sheds
his
guerdon
the
waiting
earth
o
what
a
charm
there
is
in
purity
of
morn
life
love
and
nature
all
this
scene
so
clear
and
calm
and
peaceful
that
it
fills
the
soul
with
its
blessedness
pales
the
glare
of
noon
and
man
rude
lust
to
scarce
the
semblance
of
its
former
self
but
with
the
heart
o
god
thy
richest
gift
is
innocence
that
like
a
quenchless
spring
of
everlasting
light
encircles
life
with
beauty
and
unfading
radiance
keeping
all
sense
and
feeling
fresh
and
sweet
as
the
untainted
breathing
of
the
morn
how
lovely
is
all
nature
separate
from
man
there
is
no
whispering
of
strife
or
sorrow
here
naught
to
inform
the
soul
of
man
deep
wretchedness
and
sin
no
lust
to
justify
the
wretch
who
binds
his
soul
in
the
drear
darkness
of
a
murky
cell
scraping
for
gold
as
beasts
do
in
the
earth
for
carrion
and
counting
out
by
ducats
closing
house
and
heart
alike
to
the
benignant
sunshine
if
our
hearts
could
lave
in
lethe
cleansing
stream
sometimes
till
evil
vanished
from
its
memory
and
left
a
virgin
tablet
for
the
pen
of
nature
life
would
be
as
sweet
as
love
what
far
extremes
of
woe
and
blessedness
this
earth
can
yield
the
woe
create
the
joy
begotten
from
a
never
failing
womb
woe
fashioned
out
of
craft
and
guile
and
sin
that
hungereth
for
prey
till
as
it
were
the
mother
eats
the
babe
that
sucks
her
breast
the
joy
inherent
and
diffused
like
light
from
the
eternal
glory
of
the
sun
gather
from
all
things
sight
and
sound
and
sense
from
the
very
breeze
that
whispers
us
of
yielded
sweetness
and
unhoarded
gifts
o
god
preserve
my
heart
emancipate
from
all
world
feelings
that
must
die
with
time
like
things
unworthy
of
eternity
sow
in
my
spirit
seed
that
may
spring
up
and
bud
and
increase
throughout
life
until
it
blossom
fully
in
the
light
of
heaven
grant
that
the
evil
of
the
world
may
harden
my
heart
against
the
sweet
impress
of
beauty
that
beholding
there
she
see
no
mirror
image
of
her
loveliness
methinks
life
were
a
curse
if
separate
from
loving
of
the
good
and
beautiful
to
gaze
upon
that
azure
dome
so
blue
and
penetrate
with
sunshine
through
and
through
as
lover
eyes
with
fondness
the
far
hills
and
meadows
sloping
to
the
stream
with
tints
of
bosky
shadows
yet
not
feel
a
motion
in
the
spirit
like
the
tide
of
waving
woodlands
rippled
by
a
breeze
better
return
to
dust
from
which
we
sprang
and
bid
the
winds
of
heaven
scatter
it
spirit
love
beauty
let
it
be
an
atmosphere
above
thee
and
around
whence
comes
the
breath
of
life
and
health
and
gladness
yet
beware
thy
love
be
not
an
ideality
that
like
the
smile
upon
a
sculptur
lip
freezes
upon
the
stone
nor
sheds
abroad
the
genial
influence
of
a
loving
heart
there
is
an
aim
still
nobler
than
the
love
of
beauty
to
show
beauty
forth
in
and
that
like
some
fertilizing
stream
it
glide
to
eternity
beauty
quiescent
loseth
half
its
charms
as
a
blue
eye
when
sleep
hath
closed
its
lid
but
in
its
operation
is
a
star
that
leaves
a
track
of
glory
on
the
sky
worst
miser
he
who
hoards
up
in
his
soul
the
blessed
wealth
of
beauty
and
repels
unbenison
the
weary
at
his
gate
there
is
a
way
to
make
life
glorious
and
nobler
than
the
heritage
of
kings
though
thy
path
lie
along
a
vale
in
life
with
mountain
pride
reared
up
on
either
side
to
make
thy
march
triumphant
trailing
not
the
colours
of
thy
purpose
in
the
dust
and
be
received
as
victor
into
heaven
set
beauty
in
thy
soul
like
a
to
warn
thee
from
the
rocks
and
shoals
of
wrong
and
guide
thee
surely
to
thy
journey
end
let
her
pure
promptings
stablish
in
thy
heart
a
living
spring
of
motive
that
may
flow
through
thought
and
action
like
the
veinëd
life
through
man
and
all
his
members
not
for
praise
let
thy
work
be
nor
gain
but
heaven
and
right
and
for
the
feeling
of
that
sweetest
sense
that
from
thy
sowing
springeth
up
no
tare
of
grief
or
bitterness
but
goodly
fruit
that
nourisheth
the
heart
and
gives
it
strength
to
combat
manfully
for
life
and
truth
look
manhood
in
the
face
unblanchingly
with
no
veil
it
and
thee
with
pure
integrity
to
match
the
great
and
humbleness
to
poize
thee
with
the
small
look
at
its
guilt
and
shame
as
on
deep
wounds
wherefrom
a
life
is
flowing
seek
thou
then
to
staunch
them
in
thy
measure
mark
its
wrongs
the
burden
of
oppression
and
the
toil
that
grind
the
sand
of
life
down
till
it
run
like
water
through
the
mighty
glass
of
time
and
let
thy
voice
come
like
a
trump
to
call
the
faithful
to
the
rescue
find
the
weak
and
weary
and
the
desolate
of
heart
faint
with
the
sorrows
and
the
cares
of
life
and
let
no
act
add
to
their
bitter
cup
one
drop
of
gall
but
like
a
priest
do
thou
tell
them
of
hope
and
peace
and
gladden
them
with
that
blest
balm
pure
kindness
which
transforms
with
more
than
magian
art
the
meanest
act
into
the
brightness
of
the
summer
sun
doth
not
this
quiet
hour
fall
on
thy
soul
like
music
dropping
from
the
spheres
man
ay
sooth
it
is
most
sweet
methinks
that
such
a
time
were
meeter
far
for
lover
tryst
than
eve
when
the
dark
night
must
sadden
their
vows
and
hide
them
from
each
other
now
all
things
are
pure
and
beautiful
as
love
should
be
the
dew
of
youth
fresh
on
them
and
though
life
should
darken
with
clouds
as
it
roll
on
still
love
would
light
them
on
like
the
bright
guide
of
israel
to
the
promised
land
of
rest
is
beautiful
love
plighted
in
the
morn
of
life
when
not
a
shadow
dims
its
heaven
plighted
for
good
or
ill
as
fate
may
rule
enduring
alike
true
through
sun
and
storm
save
when
the
cold
blast
sweeps
across
the
way
it
knits
them
only
closer
heart
to
heart
spirit
love
is
no
faint
exotic
made
to
bloom
in
the
close
summer
of
a
glassy
frame
that
at
the
first
breath
of
the
unquelled
air
shrivels
up
like
a
parchment
in
the
flame
no
let
it
stand
upon
the
mountain
brow
and
bid
the
untamed
winds
make
sport
of
it
yet
though
they
drive
it
them
in
their
might
be
like
the
strong
eagle
that
exults
in
the
wild
rapture
of
his
headlong
swoop
the
strongest
and
the
tenderest
is
love
man
now
as
i
gaze
upon
this
cloudless
sky
so
soft
and
tranquil
paints
to
me
one
whose
life
bid
as
fair
that
my
heart
said
beholding
her
o
flower
so
bright
and
sweet
with
the
pure
dew
of
maidenhood
bestrewn
thy
life
will
be
unfolded
like
the
rose
that
leaf
by
leaf
adds
sweetness
to
the
spring
she
was
most
beautiful
but
more
in
this
that
she
moved
like
an
angel
to
joy
and
peace
and
charity
the
weak
rejoiced
before
her
as
the
embodied
smile
of
providence
and
sadden
when
she
pass
and
yet
one
short
short
year
and
she
was
gone
her
heart
pierced
through
with
thorns
who
had
borne
the
semblance
of
a
sorrow
into
life
is
there
no
armour
against
sorrow
sting
spirit
the
highway
of
this
world
is
set
with
thorns
which
poor
pilgrims
still
must
journey
on
there
are
who
walk
it
shod
with
iron
sense
that
crushes
opposition
like
a
vice
and
puts
aside
the
ready
points
like
twigs
pressed
backward
in
the
woodlands
by
a
child
there
are
who
seem
buoyed
upward
by
some
power
above
the
level
of
affliction
range
until
their
term
be
run
and
then
they
fall
into
the
bosom
of
the
angel
death
and
there
are
some
whose
tender
feet
are
pierced
evermore
deeper
by
the
rugged
path
whose
softness
and
whose
beauty
nigh
invite
the
cruel
spoiler
to
his
unarmed
prey
as
the
swift
hawk
high
poizëd
in
the
sky
swoops
when
the
dove
floats
past
on
wings
there
is
a
veil
upon
the
eyes
of
men
that
makes
all
things
show
dimly
but
if
rent
would
work
like
resurrection
on
the
mind
bringing
to
life
thoughts
dead
in
doubt
and
error
thus
standing
on
the
bridge
of
time
which
spans
the
gulf
two
eternities
through
which
flows
ever
on
the
tide
of
human
life
that
troubled
stream
would
seem
a
sea
of
glass
and
all
its
thick
impurities
appear
clear
as
the
outline
of
a
floating
corpse
gaze
down
upon
it
though
it
sicken
thee
there
cometh
one
beneath
whose
ermined
pride
stalks
the
corruption
of
a
where
flesh
lies
in
its
cloth
of
gold
yet
the
wonder
of
the
gaping
crowd
upon
his
brow
the
jewelled
circlet
rests
his
only
title
to
nobility
but
that
unto
the
vulgar
symbols
still
the
orbit
of
the
everlasting
sun
that
fills
and
glorifies
a
universe
of
clay
where
is
the
mind
that
should
have
overtopp
the
level
of
the
multitude
where
the
bold
front
that
in
the
breach
of
wrong
stemm
the
fierce
current
of
insidious
foes
flashing
truth
falchion
in
the
van
of
time
shame
it
hath
rusted
in
its
scabbard
till
the
nerveless
arm
can
scarce
withdraw
it
thence
o
earth
rejoice
that
at
his
side
there
comes
an
undimm
light
to
beacon
on
the
world
one
who
upholds
the
honour
of
his
line
unsullied
as
the
glory
of
the
stars
whose
voice
rings
clear
above
the
battle
strife
and
shakes
oppression
from
his
iron
throne
and
for
the
purple
round
his
heaving
breast
folds
like
a
vesture
manly
honesty
is
it
not
glorious
the
light
that
gilds
the
hoary
summits
of
the
giant
hills
spread
like
the
standard
of
eternal
truth
many
phalanxed
ages
blazoning
the
stalwart
band
that
barrier
from
the
world
the
bitter
fury
of
heaven
huricanes
onward
there
come
a
mass
who
drown
defects
and
vices
in
a
shower
of
gold
who
crush
report
like
rome
the
sabine
maid
beneath
the
burden
of
their
molten
wealth
and
their
gilding
flaunt
them
in
the
sun
brightly
as
though
there
were
no
dross
within
so
the
eye
sees
them
but
search
thou
the
soul
and
part
the
sterling
from
the
counterfeit
oh
for
the
sighing
of
the
desolate
the
widow
and
the
orphan
in
their
woe
drown
the
clink
of
gold
wrung
from
their
need
like
moisture
from
the
crushing
of
the
grape
oh
for
the
fruitless
cry
of
misery
the
tantalus
of
stern
reality
that
feebly
perisheth
in
famine
grasp
whilst
plenty
moulders
for
the
lust
of
pride
and
adds
its
rottenness
to
the
of
wantonness
and
subtle
infamy
and
yet
the
worker
wears
as
fair
a
port
as
he
whose
life
is
holy
charity
setting
his
footprints
on
the
way
of
life
like
sunshine
rippling
the
summer
sea
some
wear
their
little
merit
on
their
sleeve
which
the
friction
of
time
troublous
waves
grows
threadbare
as
the
coat
of
beggary
some
under
rugged
lineaments
enclose
treasures
of
truth
and
goodness
that
like
gems
shine
through
the
fissures
of
the
strong
showing
more
perfect
as
affliction
works
and
sorrow
rends
the
earthy
covering
some
are
there
with
the
sight
turned
inwards
still
beholding
but
the
narrow
sphere
of
self
and
trampling
under
foot
the
weak
who
stand
betwixt
them
and
the
goal
of
their
desire
blessed
the
few
who
unto
fellow
men
turn
with
the
fervent
grasp
of
brotherhood
breasting
the
surges
of
tempestuous
fate
with
souls
fulfilled
with
kindliness
and
faith
raising
the
ensign
of
prophetic
hope
like
the
clear
rainbow
on
the
and
the
darkness
of
impending
care
pouring
the
cheerful
daylight
of
the
soul
there
are
sweet
spirits
mingling
with
the
throng
marked
out
with
sunshine
like
the
pouting
waves
when
heaven
looks
down
in
sun
and
shadow
hearts
so
leaven
through
with
grace
and
purity
that
though
sin
warp
and
sift
them
at
its
will
some
hidden
sweetness
lingers
yet
to
tell
the
perfectness
of
nature
are
they
not
as
the
ministers
of
heaven
liveried
with
beauty
and
deep
tenderness
missioned
in
mercy
to
this
fallen
sphere
proclaiming
peace
and
blessedness
above
threading
the
ranks
of
earth
fierce
battle
field
amid
the
clangour
of
steel
raising
the
wounded
from
their
helplessness
and
bearing
life
draughts
to
the
sinking
soul
o
mother
earth
thine
arms
will
fondle
her
when
ingrate
man
hath
drain
her
spirit
dry
fashioned
in
weakness
yet
in
weakness
strong
where
honour
were
the
foeman
what
is
she
before
the
onslaught
of
satanic
serfs
the
mirror
of
her
purity
obscured
polluted
by
lust
pestilential
breath
pluck
like
a
flower
to
while
an
hour
away
then
cast
to
wither
on
the
barren
ground
shattered
and
bruised
beneath
base
passion
heel
and
all
the
clinging
tendrils
of
her
love
torn
bleeding
from
the
stay
round
which
they
clung
look
thou
upon
that
stream
rough
with
the
whirl
of
crime
and
woe
and
wretchedness
that
float
like
poisoned
scum
upon
the
driving
flood
filling
the
breath
of
life
with
noxious
blasts
that
smite
humanity
with
pestilence
and
tremble
thou
though

it
not
ten
thousand
times
more
foul

to

then
praise
him
for
the
twilight
of
thy
sense
yet
there
is
much
of
good
and
fair
in
life
that
like
the
glow
upon
the
eastern
sky
blazons
the
glory
of
approaching
day
man
o
is
not

then
sweetest
to
the
soul
in
utter
solitude
or
that
deep
calm
when
all
of
earth
its
cares
and
interests
are
shaken
from
the
spirit
as
the
moth
doffs
from
its
wings
the
natal
crysalis
and
wanders
through
the
blue
serene
of
heaven
in
this
pure
scene
the
din
of
man
would
sound
harsher
than
discord
amid
melody
here
no
rude
tongue
should
whisper
of
the
things
poor
earth
bows
down
to
worship
fashion
wealth
and
hollow
mockings
gilded
by
a
name
that
makes
the
calf
which
browses
on
the
plain
turn
to
a
god
when
moulded
in
the
gold
no
thought
should
rise
that
passing
into
speech
might
soil
the
purity
of
flowers
fresh
with
the
dews
of
morn
and
paradise
but
like
an
angel
singing
through
the
skies
wing
the
blue
empyrean
of
the
mind
and
break
in
music
on
the
thrilling
sense
spirit
is
there
no
music
in
the
gentle
word
that
falls
in
consolation
on
the
sad
starting
the
crystal
tear
into
the
eye
filtrate
through
gratitude
till
there
remain
naught
earthy
in
its
brightness
though
the
scene
be
as
a
plague
spot
on
the
face
of
earth
sweet
charity
can
cleanse
it
till
it
shine
bright
as
the

monarch
crown
that
not

dim

from

the

the
mark
of

set
on
him
for
an
everlasting
work
with

this

swallow
the

soul
and
leave
its

desolate
looks
down
on
earth
and
all
its
jarring
multitudes
its
miseries
of
soul

as
earth
looks
on

distant
glory
of
the
stars
all
unparticipant

down

bind
the
mighty
thunder
in

universe
thy

with
the
trenchant
lightning
dost
search
out
the
limits

immensity

bare
its
inmost
soul
to
thy
dread
scrutiny
before
whose
holiness
the
sun
grows
dim

vanishes
to
nothingness
like
mist

the
winds
sweep
the
bounds
of
space
strong
in

fulness
of
the
bough

thou
upon
me

dead
for
doom

him
from
false
security
and
sloth
and
rouse
the
within
him
though
it
be
feeble
and
powerless
as
a
creeping
babe
let
them
break
on
the
conscience
of
the
base
as
billows
break
upon
the
shifting
sands
crumbling
the
false
foundations
of
his
hope
and
sweeping
all
his
theories
to
naught
let
them
rush
swifter
on
him
as
he
flees
circle
him
with
their
terrors
everywhere
snatch
from
his
clutching
fingers
every
prop
that
guilt
or
error
flings
him
till
he
fall
into
the
waves
of
truth
a
drowning
man
with
not
a
straw
to
grasp
at
let
them
smite
wrong
and
oppression
like
a
gnawing
blight
eating
into
the
heart
till
like
dead
leaves
shrivell
and
beggars
tread
them
down
let
them
fall
on
the
pure
in

like
dews
to
strengthen
and
to
nourish
all
sweet

raising
the
drooping
and
the
weary
up
and
adding
sweetness
to
the
path
of
life
to
all
may
they
be
wafted
on
the
wings
of
love
not
the
false
love
that
shines
alike
on
flower
and
weed
until
the
evil
rise
to
choke
the
good
seed
with
its
overgrowth

let
deep
kindness
fill
them
utterly
in
comfort
or
in
sorrow
or
in
doom
hard
is
their
journey
and
unsmooth
their
way
who
walk
like
pilgrims
to
eternal
fame
raising
for
ever
hymns
of
love
and
beauty
amid
the
jar
and
weariness
of
life
working
through
joy
and
sorrow
equally
to
stamp
their
names
upon
the

great
heart
and
piercing
their

bosoms
like
the
bird
for
glowing
streams
to
nourish

it
is
glorious
to
make
this

great
in
the
strength
of
action
till
it
stand
a
landmark
and
a
guide
immoveable
to
witness
of
the
struggle
and
the
end
a
life
of
thought
is
blossom
without
fruit
o
life
would
i
could
map
thy
minutes
out
and
give
to
each
its
purpose
like
a
king
to
claim
just
tribute
from
futurity
would
i
could
freight
ye
with
such
spirit
power
that
like
a
huge
rock
cast
into
the
sea
ye
sent
time
waving
back
for
evermore
would
ye
could
track
your
footsteps
out
in
deeds
like

in
the
soft
sands
that
heaven
decree
changeth
into
the
adamantine
rock
till
time
nor
tide
can
wipe
the
trace
away
let
my
steps
march
right
onward
pausing
none
for
pleasure
or
for
folly
for
the
path
is
long
and
difficult
and
hard
to
walk
and
at
its
limit
lies
eternity
let
no
false
weakness
clog
me
in
the
work
and
cramp
the
motions
of
my
willing
soul
but
let
me
gird
my
spirit
up
to
run
before
the
chariot
of
the
speeding
age
a
prophet
and
a
poet
and
a
guide
o
my
heart
thrills
to
that
great
watchword
act
to
leave
no
record
written
on
the
sand
for
the
first
wave
to
crumble
into
naught
but
to
materialize
on
thought
to
raise
a
standard
glorious
with
the
sign
of
heaven
and
set
it
waving
oblivion
to
seize
on
spirit
like
a
willow
rod
and
bend
and
fashion
it
to
perfect
use
curbing
its
wayward
fancies
and
desires
until
it
sway
true
to
the
poet
creed
to
move
earth
multitudes
with
nervous
power
and
burning
eloquence
as
leaves
are
swept
before
the
breathing
of
a
mighty
wind
urging
them
on
for
truth
and
nobleness
and
leading
on
the
van
to
show
the
way
no
prating
coward
framing

on
with

there
standing

set
in
the

the

spiritualized
words
sublimate
by
earnestness
and
truth
to
the
reality
and
force
of
deed
falling
upon
the
great
world
soul
like
spells
that
take
the
reason
captive
and
subdue
its
motions
to
the
gentle
sway
of
love
his
thoughts
are
like
the
moonlight
that
enshrines
all
earth
and
heaven
with
beauty
and
soft
grace
pouring
rich
floods
of
radiance
divine
life
reality
of
grief
and
pain
making
sorrow
luminous
and
sweet
and
freighting
sighs
with
gentlest
melody
his
creed
is
love
love
perfect
uncontrolled
twining
round
all
the
good
and
beautiful
as
ivy
twineth
round
the
sapling
oak
evermore
growing
with
its
growth
more
strong
till
not
death
can
tear
those
arms
away
love
winging
creation
like
the
morn
and
light
and
beauty
as
it
flies
mountain
vale
and
streamlet
equally
in
flowery
mead
and
desert
solitude
making
itself
a
presence
of
delight
a
radiant
glory
sweeter
than
all
forms
all
shows
all
substance
rising
in
the
soul
like
water
in
the
desert
heaven
in
death
opening
the
unseen
gates
of
heaven
till
sense
dream
of
its
utter
blessedness
and
peace
leading
life
onward
like
an
angel
pure
through
strife
and
sorrow
scatheless
and
secure
scattering
joy
around
it
evermore
like
benisons
shed
from
a
mother
heart
making
the
weary
and
the
bruizëd
glad
wiping
the
tears
from
sorrow
clouded
eyes
and
soothing
pain
like
woman
tenderness
let
me
love
all
things
with
a
perfect
love
that
would
coin
its
own
to
pay
life
ransom
from
the
bitterness
of
woe
bear
tenderly
upon
the
weaknesses
of
flesh
and
its
oft
seen
infirmities
and
turn
with
hope
and
trustfulness
to
man
let
me
not
be
a
stunted
thorn
on
earth
with
jaggëd
points
to
scare
all
fondness
off
unsweeten
by
a
blossom
or
a
bud
and
branded
deep
with
harsh
sterility
but
like
a
soft
wind
breathing
to

love

through
the

sorrow
without

came
a

it
which
nor

can
sever

crush

strong
in
their
greatness
in
their
truth
secure
iv
would
that
some
faint
ray
of
the
heavenly
light
shower
on
thy
children
now
might
rest
on
me
illume
my
twilight
thoughts
and
grant
me
sight
into
the
depths
of
nature
poesie
and
tune
my
faltering
tones
to
breathe
aright
that
which
my
heart
so
fondly
feels
of
thee
for
a
music
sweet
as
heaven
own
lays
could
love
deep
soul
be
cadenced
in
thy
praise
there
was
a
garden
sloping
to
the
west
smooth
downward
from
the
giant
apennines
the
serried
outlines
of
whose
hoary
crest
blent
with
the
distant
heavens
in
mystic
lines
at
eventide
with
golden
splendours
drest
when
the
red
sun
its
farewell
greeting
shines
a
palace
topped
it
from
whose
terraced
height
wound
a
broad
stair
of
marble
snowy
white
vi
and
paths
went
wandering
beneath
the
sweep
of
orange
boughs
and
trelliced
vines
whose
leaves
gave
in
their
parting
many
a
transient
peep
of
the
blue
sky
as
through
eaves
and
oft
they
led
to
arbours
shaded
deep
as
are
the
nooks
the
midway
forest
weaves
and
carven
forms
of
nymphs
and
dryads
gleamed
through
leafy
screens
as
though
a
poet
dreamed
vii
a
fountain
rippled
in
the
midst
and
threw
coolness
into
the
sky
the
sculptor
thought
a
quaint
conceit
aurora
flinging
dew
upon
the
earth
the
marble
finely
wrought
till
through
the
drops
it
grew
warm
with
existence
all
its
fair
limbs
fraught
with
grace
and
motion
was
a
thing
so
human
the
heart
forgot
the
goddess
in
the
woman
viii
beside
the
marge
of
this
fair
fountain
stood
a
maiden
trancëd
with
its
melting
sound
for
rillet
murmurs
are
to
pensive
mood
sweet
as
the
to
the
thirsty
ground
alas
that
youth
so
soon
should
feel
the
rude
and
merciless
stinging
of
cold
sorrow
wound
that
nature
sweetest
melodies
should
gain
the
heart
full
rapture
through
the
ear
of
pain
ix
she
was
a
maiden
in
whose
gentle
mien
the
spirit
mirror
all
its
fairest
hues
as
on
the
undimm
summer
sky
serene
the
noonday
sun
its
golden
splendour
strews
her
deep
blue
eye
with
tender
sheen
like
sadness
through
whose
frame
soft
smiles
infuse
whilst
on
her
lip
expression
rippling
lay
and
limned
in
silence
what
the
soul
would
say
x
her
was
a
beauty
vivified
by
grace
that
made
each
motion
music
to
the
eye
beam
from
the
sunny
sweetness
of
her
face
and
tuned
her
accents
all
so
tenderly
that
when
alcesté
spake
the
heart
could
trace
a
woman
spirit
full
of
motions
high
and
kind
and
noble
and
whose
inward
bent
sway
to
all
courses
pure
and
innocent
xi
there
were
full
many
suitors
who
had
their
amorous
orisons
before
her
shrine
and
with
the
flutter
of
a
doublet
vied
to
win
the
smile
they
toasted
their
wine
there
were
full
many
who
with
blinded
pride
deem
that
a
title
could
the
scale
incline
and
flung
their
lordships
down
daring
a
cæsar
to
refuse
a
crown
xii
but
there
was
one
who
loved
for
love
own
sake
and
treasured
its
dear
sweetness
in
his
breast
whose
spirit
thrill
within
him
when
she
spake
and
bowed
before
her
as
the
flower
by
her
light
step
and
who
could
ever
make
a
long
day
happy
and
a
midnight
blest
with
brooding
on
a
word
a
smile
a
glance
that
haply
served
to
sun
love
young
romance
xiii
they
had
been
playmates
in
gay
childhood
days
when
hearts
are
open
as
a
summer
flower
and
love
had
wound
them
slowly
in
his
maze
and
knit
them
close
ere
yet
they
felt
his
power
but
once
by
ways
the
silence
drew
their
souls
out
and
that
hour
hand
clasped
in
hand
and
lip
to
lip
united
their
pure
young
vows
of
constant
love
they
plighted
xiv
what
spirit
fused
into
the
blossom
spray
and
wreathed
about
them
in
its
waving
scent
what
angel
echoes
tuned
the
thrushes
lay
and
gave
the
tones
such
sudden
ravishment
for
sure
they
were
sweet
as
on
that
day
nor
with
such
magic
to
the
spirit
went
if
it
was
love
then
love
is
wondrous
sweet
the
point
of
life
where
earth
and
heaven
meet
xv
yet
love
but
drew
the
summer
clouds
away
that
curtain
heaven
from
their
raptured
eyes
still
from
attainment
spread
an
ocean
wide
and
bade
them
pause
in
sight
of
paradise
her
father
sternly
his
fond
suit
denied
nor
soften
to
his
prayers
nor
heard
his
sighs
so
julian
shrined
her
image
in
his
soul
till
happier
fortune
brought
them
sweeter
dole
xvi
now
at
verona
sojourn
he
a
space
dreaming
of
her
as
he
must
everywhere
unconscious
of
the
woes
that
grew
apace
and
soon
might
drive
his
spirit
to
despair
unconscious
that
his
love
in
grief
embrace
cradled
her
panting
soul
nigh
dead
with
care
and
wept
at
noontide
wept
at
dewy
eve
till
the
light
that
saw
her
seem
to
grieve
xvii
there
was
a
suitor
who
with
crooked
frame
crawled
in
the
race
for
beauty
thither
prest
not
the
gaze
of
heaven
but
as
in
shame
hid
he
the
purpose
in
his
own
dark
breast
and
serpented
his
motions
to
his
aim
like
one
who
stabs
a
victim
in
his
rest
for
still
the
heart
must
feel
in
its
calm
time
that
to
crush
love
true
spirit
is
a
crime
xviii
one
midnight
gather
round
the
fatal
board
where
wealth
death
rattle
echoes
in
the
dice
her
sire
amieri
with
some
others
pored
in
full
abstraction
of
the
cursëd
vice
each
golden
piece
raked
from
his
precious
hoard
froze
the
vext
of
the
wretch
like
ice
there
was
no
sound
save
the
cold
ring
of
gold
that
broke
the
stillness
as
a
knell
had
toll
xix
amieri
staked
and
lost
and
staked
again
drawn
fascinated
to
his
ruin
fast
imploring
fortune
to
his

desperate
he
staked
all
on

fell
down

slain

seeming
at
a
moment
past
like
gambling
pledges
raked
from
earth
rich
hoard
by
death
strong
hand
whose
gains
are
restored
xx
better
if
he
had
staked
upon
a
throw
his
honour
and
his
daughter
openly
and
thus
like
some
fell
fiend
at
one
swift
blow
sunk
all
he
loved
in
utter
misery
than
yielding
unto
calculation
slow
consent
to
blast
them
and
a
witness
be
while
sorrow
sapped
the
vigour
of
her
frame
and
with
her
weakness
stronger
grew
his
shame
xxi
for
in
the
morning
the
betrayer
rose
the
crippled
pietro
the
false
lover
and
with
honied
phrases
and
well
studied
shows
sought
from
amieri
poor
alcesté
hand
whilst
for
his
intercession
he
bestows
full
restitution

yield
xxii
amieri
humbled
like
a
guilty
thing
beneath

level
tremblingly
agreed
and
sought
by
torture
of
the
mind
to
wring
her
sad
consent
to
save
him
in
his
need
falsehood
and
art
together
to
soften
her
weak
heart
and
gild
the
deed
by
prayers
he
moved
her
and
by
childish
tears
and
fann
into
fierce
flame
her
woman
fears
xxiii
till
she
poor
fluttering
dove
mesh
in
the
net
panted
with
bitter
anguish
and
dismay
by
love
and
fear
so
grievously
beset
that
each
would
draw
her
on
a
way
her
tears
at
night
the
sleepless
pillow
wet
and
coursed
along
her
pallid
cheeks
by
day
making
life
weary
sad
and
full
of
woe
her
hopes
of
bliss
and
rapture
shatter
so
xxiv
when
did
a
woman
spirit
true
and
sweet
close
its
issues
against
pity
cry
hold
the
field
for
self
without
defeat
nor
yield
to
prayer
though
yielding
were
to
die
and
so
she
trembled
to
this
calm
retreat
to
weep
her
bitter
doom
forth
silently
where
in
the
sadness
of
the
fountain
tone
she
heard
a
gentle
echo
of
her
own
xxv
a
feeble
step
trail
the
gravell
way
at
which
she
thrill
and
turned
in
sudden
fright
whilst
in
her
eyes
there
shot
a
fitful
ray
that
scorched
the
tears
up
with
its
flashing
light
he
was
a
weak
old
man
and
time
decay
stood
on
his
brow
and
thin
locks
snowy
white
and
trembling
hands
that
shook
upon
his
staff
as
though
alive
they
wrote
their
epitaph
xxvi
slowly
he
came
reading
with
anxious
eyes
the
thoughts
that
flicker
on
alcesté
mien
veiling
dishonour
under
virtue
guise
and
avarice
as
though
sorrow
keen
and
still
tears

groans

piping
sighs
he
querulled
forth
his
plaints

thy

xxvii
sir
softly
said
she
while
the
colour
fled
from
her
smooth
cheeks
till
they
grew
ashy
pale
cast
off
your
mourning
features
i
will

death
should
be

my
comfort
lie
for

be
sore

think
not
sir
she
said
on
with
noble
scorn
this
husband
of
your
choosing
loses
aught
in
that
the
world
doth
know
him
basely
born
and
with
a
shrine
that
fits
the
inner
thought
think
not
a
silly
woman
heart
will
mourn
a
shape
in
nature
merry
moments
wrought

weep
the
finding
of
each
broad
defect

wish

form
less
wry

more
erect
xxix
no
sir
each
twisted
joint
will
be
my
pride
the
blazon
of
my
fortunes
to
the
crowd
till
envy
shall
pursue
the
happy
bride
sworn
to
a
lord
with
graces
so
endowed
and
fame
shall
bear
his
virtues
far
and
wide
and
trumpet
them
unto
the
world
aloud

let
them
say
she
is
is
a
jewel
rare
and
she
is
naught
xxx
but
sir
although
i
would
not
have
men
hold
my
love
won
by
his
merits

charms
this
tongue
shall
the
bitter
truth
unfold

falsehood
soil
me
with
its
sneering
harms
is
meet

the
secret
should
be
told

henceforth
a
stern
law
my
grief
disarms
pray
heaven
sir
that
your
conscience
may
be
dumb

his
as
my
lips
for
the
time
to
come
xxxi
thus
far
her
woman
indignation
ran
roused
into
conflict
by
the
cruel
wrong
standing
erect
before
that
crouching
man
weak
in
his
shame
she
in
her
virtue
strong
whilst
on
her
quivering
lips
and
cheeks
so
wan
reproach
and
scorn
alternate
coursed
along
but
to
her
heart
the
silence
went
and
then
she
swept
past
in
her
gentleness
again
xxxii
the
tresses
rustling
on
her
neck
and
she
a
woman
meek
and
tender
as
a
dove

to
her
full
heart
stricken
utterly
and
as
she
went
her
moist
eyes
turn
above
sighing
poor
julian
heaven
have
care
of
thee
and
grant
thee
mercy
for
thy
hapless
love
she
said
no
more
but
was
a
piteous
thing
to
see
a
helpless
maid
so
sorrowing
xxxiii
she
wept
her
tears
full
out
for
on
the
day
that
was
to
make
her
bride
the
lids
were
bare
and
such
cold
sternness
on
her
lips
did
stay
it
seemed
as
though
a
smile
had
been
there
they
clad
her
graceful
form
in
white
array
and
twined
sweet
blossoms
with
her
golden
hair
and
made
her
lovely
who
must
still
be
so
despair
and
tears
and
cruel
woe
xxxiv
he
darken
by
her
side
with
honied
smile
and
fawning
courtesy
and
limping
stride
showing
to
those
who
knew
the
heart
more
vile
the
baseness
that
his
gilding
sought
to
hide
but
she
went
on
unmoved
and
stood
the
while
still
as
a
marble
statue
at
his
side
certes
a
terror
the
spirit
crept
it
had
been
mercy
had
the
lady
wept
xxxv
julian
heard
it

with
passion
burning

to
florence

at

spurning
rush
into

said
alcesté

said
nothing

gazed
a

into
her
melting
eyes

woefully
her
poor

flutter
sore
like
a
caged
lark
that
thrills
to
mount
the
skies

this
the
bliss

pictured
is
this
the
rapture
this
the
paradise
o
perjured
vows

cruel
love

said
thus
at
a
blow
to
strike
hope
spirit
dead
xxxvii
he
said
shame
on
a
venal
love
like
thine
that
barters

that
kneels

for

stood
stone
still
and
answer
a
word
though
sore
the
taunts
went
stabbing
through
her
breast
but
her
heart
beat
till
it
could
nigh
be
heard
amid
the
silence
of
her
breath
supprest

through
her
frame
a
fitful
tremor
stirr
like

in

him
to

as
within
some
horrid

alive
to
torture

to
deadly
ill

powerless
of

through

down

by

up

it
came
despair
so
still
she
lay
so
icy
cold
and
sere
and
silently
and
slow
they
crept
away
with
bated
breath
as
though
she
lay
xlvi
they
pale
torches
at
her
moveless
feet
that
flung
grey
shadows
round
the
ghostly
room
and
ofttimes
misty
clouds
of
incense
sweet
went
wreathing
upward
through
the
gloom
there
was
no
sound
not
a
faint
but
all
was
silent
as
it
were
death
tomb
and
from
without
the
breezes
as
they
drave
sigh
low
and
sad
like
mourners
a
grave
xlvii
the
maiden
lay
there
beautiful
and
pure
as
one
that
slept
and
sunn
her
soul
in
heaven
from
every
chance
of
grief
and
pain
secure
sublimed
from
every
taint
of
earthly
leaven
her
placid
bosom
through
white
vestiture
shone
soft
and
holy
that
poor
breast
so
riven
and
her
small
hands
prest
gently
as
in
prayer
breath
from
the
earth
to
heaven
and
ended
there
xlviii
they
came
with
stilly
tread
and
panting
breath
and
softly
laid
her
on
the
narrow
bier
a
lovely
sleeper
in
the
arms
of
death
unruffled
by
a
dream
or
chilly
fear
as
some
fair
child
that
sweetly
slumbereth
upon
the
bosom
of
her
mother
dear
they
bore
the
dead
forth
over
flowers
to
rest
whose
living
feet
on
cruel
thorns
had
prest
xlix
he
crooked
though
in
frame
in
spirit
more
went
by
her
now
as
erst
he
did
in
life
a
slayer
watching
whilst
they
slowly
bore
the
helpless
victim
of
his
unseen
knife
and
sorrow
for
a
mask
he
broadly
wore
to
cloak
the
guilt
that
in
his
heart
was
rife
woe
to
thee
base
heart
from
the
lids
that
weep
woe
to
thee
base
heart
from
the
eyes
that
sleep
there
was
a
vault
within
whose
stifling
maw
lay
many
a
scion
of
amieri
race
crumbling
to
dust
beneath
death
sapping
thaw

still
melts
down
mortality
apace
and
round

fastness

raw
moulder
the
stones
with
damp
and
hideous

here
they
laid
her
beautiful
and
pure
from

in

cold
and
narrow
coffins

clammy
darkness

currents
in
foul
and
noxious
vapours
steeped

loudly
through
the
gloomy
stillness
went
the
oozy
plashes
from

dripped
marking
the

slid
away

upon

traced

escaping
from

darkly
on

making
life
seem
a
glorious
trance
full
of
bright
visions
of
heaven
safe
from
the
touch
of
reality
toil
none
woe
none
pain
wild
and
illusive
as
time
to
be
poured
like
wine
from
a
chalice
sparkling
and
joyous
for
aye
drained
amid
mirth
and
music
the
brows
circled
with
ivy
and
the
goblet
at
last
like
a
gift
thrust
in
the
bosom
of
slumber
thus
are
the
people
of
cyprus
young
men
and
old
making
holiday
decking
them
daintily
forth
in
robes
of
sidonian
purple
the
maidens
all
beauteous
but
wanton
foolishly
flinging
youth
gifts
its
jewels
its
richest
adornment
like
dross
on
the
altar
of
pleasure
letting
the
worm
of
mortality
eat
out
their
hearts
till
they
bear
only
the
semblance
of
angels
amongst
them
like
a
gaunt
and
gnarlëd
oak
waving
majestic
a
pigmy
race
pygmalion
was
for
by
the
mete
of
soul
man
ranges
in
the
phalanx
of
his
age
his
heart
was
like
an
ocean
tremulous
with
radiant
aspirations
and
high
thoughts
that
fretted
ever
on
mortality
wearing
life
out
with
passion
and
desire
struggling
against
the
limits
of
the
flesh
the
bonds
and
shackles
of
the
possible
that
bound
him
like
prometheus
to
the
dust
and
clogg
the
upward
winging
of
his
soul
he
walk
men
like
one
who
felt
the
strength
of
nobler
nature
swelling
in
his
breast
eternal
breathings
fanning
the
divine
within
him
into
flame
and
utterance
he
spake
not
much
for
that
his
heaving
thoughts
yearn
vainly
for
the
living
fire
of
heaven
to
burn
them
through
the
of
the
time
but
in
the
inner
man
the
tumult
sped
in
burning
currents
like
the
ruddy
streams
from
every
of
his
heart
his
soul
hung
in
an
atmosphere
of
grace
and
beauty
midway
betwixt
earth
and
heaven
revolving
like
the
moon
through
azure
space
mid
starry
fancies
and
faint
orbëd
dreams
that
made
bright
in
the
spirit
flight
faint
glimmerings
of
loveliness
untold
flash
ever
on
him
in
his
solitudes
luring
him
on
to
search
and
far
pursuit
through
empyrean
altitudes
of
thought
sped
onward
by
the
thirst
to
grasp
the
spiritual
and
with
creative
hand
mould
it
to
corporal
reality
love
was
his
guiding
star
his
bright
ideal
shining
above
all
visions
and
all
dreams
as
doth
the
the
icy
north
love
in
its
broad
and
fineless
empery
ruling
directing
all
by
right
divine
pressing
its
seal
of
vassalage
on
thought
and
crushing
passion
with
relentless
heel
love
the
refiner
whose
alchymic
art
transmuteth
very
dross
to
purest
gold
passing
emotion
through
the
furnace
heat
that
scorcheth
up
its
perishable
frame
and
yields
the
essence
purified
for
act
the
soul
that
wanders
like
the
mission
dove
along
the
chaos
waste
of
boundless
thought
must
have
some
ark
to
nestle
in
on
earth
and
shelter
from
the
endless
undefined
so
to
eve
daughters
would
pygmalion
seek
won
by
sweet
hopes
and
promises
of
good
and
beauty
such
as
emblem
to
him
still
the
end
accomplish
of
aspiring
thirst
essence
and
grace
materialized
in
them
he
saw
the
sum
of
nature
perfectness
the
acmè
of
idealism
reach
fair
forms
smooth
with
the
ruddy
glow
of
health
and
ripening
time
whose
every
motion
seemed
the
of
ethereal
gracefulness
to
life
and
on
whose
lineaments
the
light
of
a
seraphic
imagery
play
forms
lithe
and
rounded
by
the
art
of
youth
to
be
the
shrines
of
spirit
excellence
and
hold
the
fusion
of
immortal
grace
unblemish
by
corporeal
defect
what
found
he
then
chalices
tinted
with
rosy
dyes
bright
elegance
of
shape
and
garniture
but
brimming
up
draughts
bitter
to
the
taste
and
nauseous
he
gazed
upon
their
beauty
which
his
soul
in
thought
had
dower
with
purity
and
truth
as
from
the
inward
reflex
of
itself
but
gazing
all
his
visions
pass
away
and
cold
reality
rose
up
to
mow
the
aureate
blossoms
from
his
soul
in
amathus
the
chill
grey
morning
that
woke
him
to
truth
ruggedness
and
left
life
struggling
joyless
sunless
to
its
goal
woman
stood
forth
before
him
beautiful
but
mocking
heaven
with
a
shameless
brow
wearing
foul
lewdness
like
a
victor
crown
and
dashing
virtue
elixir
away
from
the
deep
fountains
of
her
eyes
there
no
lucid
streams
of
holiness
and
love
but
lust
and
utter
wantonness
that
the
heart
with
loathing
fraught
with
death
to
hope
her
crimson
lips
shed
forth
no
silvery
strains
of
gentleness
and
peace
to
hymn
life
bark
across
the
heaving
waters
of
this
time
but
folly
and
discordant
revelry
sounded
around
her
evermore
and
to
sin
and
shame
with
notes
once
toned
for
heaven
no
priestess
she
of
lovely
innocence
stoled
for
the
work
with
beauty
nigh
divine
but
warping
all
her
natal
destiny
prostrate
she
lay
before
the
shrine
of
vice
yielding
herself
a
living
sacrifice
to
the
deep
blasting
of
the
idol
breath
the
heart
clings
fondly
to
the
last
faint
hope
that
bindeth
still
the
once
dear
to
its
love
rejecting
credence
whilst
a
doubt
remains
and
so
pygmalion
thought
he
is
a
phase
through
which
her
soul
doth
pass
like
rippling
streams
that
filter
for
a
space
through
earth
deep
pores
emerging
thence
more
pure
and
bright
than
erst
and
set
himself
with
patient
love
to
watch
the
giddy
current
of
her
blinded
soul
for
the
subsidence
of
its
troubled
waves
it
came
not
till
his
spirit
pour
forth
its
bitterness
and
wounded
sense
oh
living
lie
truth
outward
counterfeit
fair
masquerade
of
virtue
unknown
charms
thou
too
hast
perish
from
my
trusting
soul
thy
beauty
yet
endureth
the
fair
sweep
of
limb
and
rounded
form
such
as
my
art
can
yield
the
senseless
marble
but
the
soul
that
made
the
work
of
heaven
stand
forth
alone
so
peerless
in
its
radiant
loveliness
hath
perished
mortality
cold
grasp
and
yielded
up
the
patent
of
its
charm
henceforth
i
can
compete
with
heaven
and
fill
my
world
with
bright
creations
as
its
own
unmarr
by
inner
loathsomeness
and
sin
that
rushing
through
its
pulses
like
a
blight
make
beauty
hideous
thou
my
soul
return
sit
on
thy
throne
and
with
creative
might
people
thy
kingdom
with
a
beauteous
race
fair
form
and
nobly
featured
and
the
life
set
undulating
on
the
parian
whom
viewing
thou
cry
with
lofty
joy
the
life
without
its
baser
part
o
beauty
i
have
loved
thee
with
full
heart
follow
thy
shadowy
guidance
as
the
cloud
sails
at
the
unseen
steering
of
the
wind
sought
thee
in
heaven
and
earth
and
nature
all
led
by
supreme
adorings
and
desires
till
by
communion
with
thy
perfect
soul
mine
hath
grown
wise
in
measure
to
discern
not
now
can
i
be
satiate
with
grace
that
gildeth
but
the
superficial
frame
with
the
false
tissue
of
life
the
searching
knife
must
pierce
into
the
heart
and
shew
a
frame
veined
with
the
same
warm
stream
that
melts
in
blushes
on
the
downy
cheek
my
bright
ideal
like
the
bow
of
heaven
hath
faded
into
nothingness
and
made
a
blank
upon
the
clouded
sky
of
life
can
my
soul
live
and
love
not
i
will
call
art
my
divinity
and
bid
her
frame
new
joys
to
cherish
such
as
earth
hath
not
create
by
natural
developement
nature
shall
be
my
monitress
and
teach
the
chisel
knowledge
of
all
loveliness
that
wrought
upon
the
snowy
parian
shall
give
investiture
of
life
pure
part
grace
ease
and
motion
unexerted
power
better
no
soul
than
one
debauched
and
foul
and
shaming
beauty
with
eternal
blots
therefore
my
creature
shall
be
beautiful
with
all
that
makes
up
woman
excellence
youth
bloom
imprinted
on
her
gentle
charms
and
tenderness
set
playing
on
her
lips
whilst
round
her
gracious
presence
for
a
robe
shall
float
the
vesture
of
pure
modesty
a
woman
she
save
in
the
fallen
soul
a
spotless
angel
framed
but
spiritless
this
being
shall
i
mould
and
with
my
love
animate
to
ideal
consciousness
then
let
her
sisterhood
pass
humbled
on
unheeded
in
the
depth
of
my
content
part
ii
the
worker
forth
went
he
from
the
ebb
and
flow
of
men
whose
busy
vortex
drowneth
quiet
thought
to
hold
communion
with
wise
nature
soul
in
solitude
amongst
lone
woods
he
roamed
listing
the
murmurs
of
the
swaying
boughs
that
quivered
with
the
spirit
of
the
breeze
threading
their
archëd
aisles
with
solemn
heart
and
hiving
in
his
soul
a
myriad
thoughts
that
fell
unseen
upon
him
oft
he
stood
on
mountain
fronts
and
gazed
long
hours
away
tracing
the
sweep
of
hill
and
dale
now
veined
with
glistening
waters
and
now
dark
with
groves
still
changing
till
sight
lost
identity
and
the
ideal
and
the
real
met
he
saw
the
sun
enter
the
golden
gates
of
night
that
closed
upon
his
radiant
path
and
left
earth
wondering
and
star
by
star
unlid
their
shining
orbs
and
heaven
plain
wheel
their
bright
cars
to
greet
him
in
the
east
he
saw
the
morn
break
beautiful
and
pure
like
virgin
from
her
slumbers
and
robe
earth
in
dewy
brightness
cresting
the
far
hills
with
glorious
halos
of
oncoming
day
all
loveliness
of
earth
and
sky
he
sought
and
pondered
with
a
heart
attent
to
learn
knowing
that
beauty
like
a
parent
stream
is
nourished
by
each
trickling
rill
that
flows
into
it
and
the
soul
that
would
be
apt
to
work
its
highest
counsels
out
must
toil
through
long
to
mastery
by
units
fitness
for
the
whole
thus
did
he
till
with
spirit
brimming
up
with
glorious
inspiration
he
returned
and
set
the
in
him
to
create
his
swelling
soul
grew
patient
to
the
work
wise
with
the
sense
of
innate
potency
and
on
the
shapeless
marble
still
he
wrought
with
faith
and
firm
assurance
many
came
amid
their
aimless
wanderings
and
stood
beside
that
quiet
worker
wondering
at
the
majestic
purpose
on
his
brow
and
vapouring
forth
their
views
that
turned
his
course
as
little
as
the
air
swerveth
the
eagle
in
his
lightning
flight
many
applauded
with
patronic
warmth
and
empty
commendation
and
no
scorn
curled
his
proud
lip
not
one
defiant
word
echoed
their
nothings
into
transient
life
but
as
the
marble
grew
beneath
his
hands
to
shape
and
comeliness
his
eyes
flashed
with
the
joy
of
high
accomplishment
and
scanned
each
valiant
critic
with
a
glance
that
sifted
all
his
littleness
away
thus
did
he
till
his
work
stood
perfected
a
woman
beautiful
with
youth
and
grace
but
like
a
vestal
singled
from
her
sex
to
show
the
beauty
of
pure
innocence
her
form
was
such
as
rapt
endymion
saw
on
the
heights
of
latmos
when
he
slept
and
dreamed
heaven
down
to
him
a
glorious
shape
that
to
the
brightness
of
ethereal
charms
join
the
familiar
sweetness
of
a
maid
a
soft
clear
forehead
circled
by
the
light
that
heaven
sets
lambent
on
its
imaged
self
a
face
that
beaming
on
the
heart
of
man
as
by
a
silent
teaching
in
the
sense
makes
goodness
natural
upon
each
limb
grace
laid
its
sweet
commandment
lovingly
whilst
the
fair
bosom
glowed
with
tenderness
as
from
the
fulness
of
a
soul
beneath
woman
divinest
attribute
possessed
unsullied
and
entire
and
through
the
frame
and
every
feature
radiating
went
a
lovely
sense
of
gentleness
and
love
bright
is
the
summer
of
cyprus
undimm
the
skies
and
clear
blue
and
clear
as
a
maiden

that
loves
and
hath
never
felt
sadness
then
time
is
a
sunlit
river
flowing
flowers
and
green
pastures
brightly
onward
to
heaven
there
is
music
pervading
the
air
music
of
voice
and
of
instrument
and
the
silver
toning
of
laughters
blendeth
in
jubilant
chorus
bands
of
maidens
and
youths
with
flowing
garments
of
purple
and
zones
jewelled
and
bright
as
the
mystic
girdle
of
venus
wreathëd
with
myrtle
and
roses
and
their
beauty
wantonly
bared
to
the
swimming
glances
of

the
pathways

flowers
as
they

with

held
a

up

by
the
shadow

of
his

not

the
gods
for
victory
and
gloried
in
his
strength
with
conscious

that
made

its
drooping
energies

to

onward
through
the
fight
of
life
o
thou
divinest
arbitress
of
fate
stoop
from
thy
starry
throne
receive
my
prayer
and
grant
me
life
breath
being
for
my
work
let
not
the
love
that
glorifies
a
man
sink
the
level
of
humanity
and
take
unto
its
holiest
a
shape
of
woman
dust
engraven
on
a
stone
grant
that
this
of
my
soul
may
be
endued
with
lovely
immortality
that
she
may
have
the
throbbing
pulse
of
life
with
every
gracious
influence
to
work
some
sweet
seraphic
purpose
out

walking

that
when
i
the
worker
shall
have
gone
unto
my
rest
a
glorious
witness
may
remain
to
tell
that
such
an
one
wrought
struggled
and
attained
thus
prayed
he
and
an
answer
stirred
his
soul
that
which
is
born
of
truth
dies
never
time
still
takes
its
sweet
impression
as
it
flies
and
drops
it
into
some
wise
heart
where
it
may
blossom
and
bear
fruit
anew
to
make
its
good
perpetual
thy
prayer
is
heard
the
fire
shall
go
from
heaven
thy
work
shall
live
homeward
he
sped
and
by
his
work
stood
soon
that
sweet
visage
once
so
motionless
to
his
rapt
gaze
there
stole
the
rays
divine
that
bear
all
high
intelligence
of
heaven
and
undulating
each
graceful
line
made
the
cold
stone
angelic
liquid
eyes
bright
with
all
pure
imaginings
and
full
of
young
emotion
love
and
gentleness
beamed
softly
on
him
in
dim
wonderment
whilst
from
her
lips
that
parted
half
for
speech
flowed
the
deep
sweetness
of
a
woman
smile
and
his
perplex
spirit
shed
the
light
of
hope
and
glad
assurance
all
her
frame
glowed
with
the
rosy
hue
of
life
and
youth
and
melting
from
the
rigidness
of
stone
sank
into
attitudes
of
peerless
grace
and
when
conviction
strengthened
in
his
soul
as
the
beauties
of
his
work
expanded
the
spirit
influence
he
clasp
the
maid
unto
his
beating
heart
as
father
might
the
daughter
of
his
love
rejoicing
with
blent
pride
and
tenderness
in
the
supernal
beauty
of
his
child
hearing
within
him
murmurs
of
a
voice
i
have

have
not
wrought
in
vain
left
no
faint
record
written
on
the
tide
of
life
to
perish
with
its
setting
wave
but
my
fair
work
shall
live
for
evermore
and
through
the
phalanx
of
advancing
ages
speed
like
a
herald
sounding
to
the
world
a
man
who
crushed
oblivion
girding
up
his
soul
in
faith
and
love
like
a
god
beyond

of
time
ode
to
fancy
o
thou
art
a
sweet
and
playful
thing
and
light
as
a
lark
upon
the
wing
pouring
the
melody
of
thy
mirth
in
sunny
showers
down
to
the
earth
the
sunbeams
pave
the
crystal
waters
a
pathway
for
thee
to
triton
daughters
down
in
the
depths
of
the
waving
sea
where
their
bright
archëd
palaces
be
there
mermaids
hasten
unto
thy
side
and
sing
their
songs
till
the
ravished
tide
feels
the
soft
music
through
all
its
swells
and
whispers
them
to
the
coral
shells
fays
are
thy
playmates
at
dewy
for
their
land
they
have
made
thee
queen
crowned
thee
with
flowers
of
fadeless
hue
and
drained
thy
health
in
the
honey
dew
and
over
mountain
and
hill
and
dale
by
the
glow
of
the
moonbeams
pale
thy
merry
train
in
the
stillness
dance
like
a
beam
of
pleasure
and
radiance
thine
are
the
revels
each
summer
night
held
on
the
mead
by
the
light
till
maidens
straying
at
early
dawn
trace
thy
blithe
footsteps
upon
the
lawn
thus
dost
thou
lead
on
thy
joyous
rout
and
trip
around
till
wearied
out
and
in
the
harebells
the
yellow
bee
creeps
in
the
morning
to
waken
thee
forth
from
thy
sweet
dreams
of
joy
and
love
that
rise
in
odorous
breath
above
like
some
fair
wizard
thou
weavest
spells
over
all
flowers
and
brooks
and
dells
wreathing
above
every
mossy
bed
till
with
bright
dreams
it
is
canopied
and
through
the
atmosphere
all
things
more
lovely
and
bright
appear
losing
the
faintness
of
earthly
things
and
shining
with
heaven
illuminings
thine
are
the
naiads
and
nymphs
which
rise
from
dell
and
fountain
to
daze
our
eyes
thine
are
the
spirits
leafy
trees
whose
voices
come
to
us
on
the
breeze
thine
are
the
maidens
whose
trackless
feet
bear
to
the
flower
cups
their
honey
sweet
pressing
their
perfume
till
through
and
through
is
pierced
the
soul
of
the
rising
dew
lead
me
sweet
sprite
to
thy
sunny
dwelling
is
it
where
brooklets
are
softly
welling
amid
the
greenwoods
with
many
a
fall
making
the
musical
is
it
where
mosses
and
violets
meet
and
blend
their
lives
in
an
union
sweet
whither
the
butterflies
speed
to
tell
glad
tales
of
the
flowers
thou
lovest
so
well
in
the
covert
whose
lonely
shade
the
her
resting
place
hath
made
lulled
by
the
melody
of
her
note
till
dreams
of
elysium
round
thee
float
on
the
breast
of
the
sunlit
sea
with
ripples
of
glory
to
circle
thee
bright
flashing
dolphins
to
bear
thy
car
and
waft
thee
to
glorious
isles
afar
in
some
cave
where
the
light
of
day
borrows
new
hues
from
the
diamond
ray
paven
with
jewels
and
sand
borne
by
the
waves
from
the
mermaid
land
in
the
arms
of
the
balmy
gale
over
the
ocean
thou
lovest
to
sail
loosing
the
folds
of
thy
silken
hair
to
float
at
will
on
the
perfumed
air
is
it
by
valley
or
mountain
is
it
by
streamlet
or
limpid
fountain
tell
me
and
i
will
come
to
thee
follow
thy
flight
through
immensity
dost
thou
not
roam
in
the
realms
of
sleep
while
stars
above
thee
their
bright
watch
keep
lapping
the
soul
in
a
crystal
sea
whose
every
swell
is
felicity
and
in
the
halls
of
her
quiet
home
where
darkness
pillars
the
starry
dome
making
all
beauty
more
beautiful
and
keeping
the
moonbeams
soft
and
cool
dost
thou
not
sit
till
the
morning
beams
weaving
the
fabric
of
happy
dreams
bringing
dear
visions
to
weeping
eyes
till
sorrow
transforms
to
paradise
dost
thou
not
kiss
sweet
lips
till
they
smile
and
murmur
of
joys
they
knew
erewhile
and
build
up
hopes
that
are
shatter
quite
decking
the
past
in
a
robe
of
light
o
thou
art
a
kind
and
gentle
thing
bearing
the
gifts
that
angels
bring
joying
in
all
that
is
bright
and
free
and
soothing
the
sting
of
misery
if
thou
dwell
in
my
beating
heart
and
breathe
thy
fragrance
through
every
part
i
would
ever
love
and
obey
thee
never
slight
thee
and
never
betray
thee
into
the
hands
of
cruel
scoffers
who
sell
their
souls
to
fill
their
coffers
crush
every
flower
beneath
their
feet
and
make
the
sole
bliss
of
life
to
cheat
cheat
the
greenwoods
of
happy
ramblers
to
rear
a
race
of
slaves
and
gamblers
cheat
the
summer
cheat
the
spring
cheat
the
sweet
flowers
of
their
ministring
cheat
the
soft
meadows
and
sunny
skies
of
their
glad
tribute
from
eyes
cheat
the
birds
in
their
leafy
bowers
cheat
every
day
of
its
few
short
hours
cheat
even
life
of
its
little
pleasure
dealing
its
needfuls
out
in
short
measure
cheating
all
beauty
while
they
draw
breath
but
true
to
commerce
that
is
death
come
to
me
then
and
i
cherish
thee
thou
shalt
my
loving
companion
be
from
the
cold
world
we
will
live
apart
and
build
up
a
new
one
within
my
heart
what
is
a
sigh
it
is
the
sound
raised
by
the
sweeping
of
an
angel
wing
as
through
the
air
it
bears
a
prayer
of
the
soul
uttering
it
is
the
sweet
melodious
echo
of
some
thrilling
thought
retold
by
sadness
unto
gladness
which
memory
hath
brought
it
is
the
hymn
breath
ever
by
the
votaries
of
love
whose
dulcidence
soft
and
intense
soars
dreamily
above
it
is
the
sign
of
earth
fraternity
the
only
tie
that
links
us
all
both
great
and
small
in
common
sympathy
it
is
the
heart
issueing
from
its
prison
house
of
clay
perchance
gladly
perchance
sadly
wending
on
its
way
ione
sad
are
the
glances
from
thy
deep
blue
eyes
ione
soft
as
the
mirror
of
the
summer
skies
when
twilight
shadows
its
surface
steal
and
twinkling
stars
their
radiant
orbs
reveal
why
are
they
sad
which
were
so
glad
ione
have
their
rays
bathed
in
the
air
and
still
the
sparkling
moisture
trembles
there
then
smile
for
dewy
tears
melt
when
the
sun
appears
ione
yet
thou
art
very
beautiful
in
sadness
ione
more
beautiful
than
in
gladness
and
the
sweet
music
of
thy
gentle
sighs
comes
like
the
language
of
thy
speaking
eyes
what
do
they
say
tell
me
their
lay
ione
fain
would
i
learn
from
thee
what
passing
thought
can
with
such
plaintive
melody
be
fraught
ah
wherefore
turn
away
stay
yet
a
little
stay
ione
reality
o
the
heart
has
dreams
elysian
that
steal
it
calm
and
sweet
hushing
pain
like
a
magician
who
binds
spirits
at
his
feet
but
the
forms
that
throng
its
mazes
are
too
bright
for
mortal
birth
and
the
scenes
that
fancy
raises
far
too
beautiful
for
earth
let
us
turn
with
humbler
spirits
to
the
things
that
god
has
made
pass
the
weakness
flesh
inherits
since
the
sunshine
too
has
shade
is
the
pride
of
human
nature
that
makes
life
seem
cold
and
drear
drawing
up
a
dwarfish
stature
to
its
proper
sphere
round
it
misty
fancies
like
the
mountain
cloudy
wreath
till
the
spirit
errant
glances
see
no
beauty
underneath
there
are
true
hearts
beating
nigh
us
as
we
fight
the
fight
of
life
hearts
unstain
by
guilty
bias
hearts
unharden
by
its
strife
there
are
gentle
bosoms
swelling
with
all
motions
pure
and
kind
that
unceasingly
are
welling
solace
to
the
weary
mind
few
there
are
without
possessing
some
good
virtue
in
their
heart
whence
beneath
love
soft
compressing
as
from
flowers
sweet
perfumes
start
dreamer
turn
then
to
the
real
with
a
frank
and
trusting
soul
not
alone
to
the
ideal
let
thy
genial
currents
roll
pierce
the
clay
that
oft
encloses
the
pure
brightness
of
a
gem
think
thee
flowers
less
fair
than
roses
in
their
sweetness
rival
them
thus
in
truth
and
not
in
dreaming
life
will
blossom
to
the
full
unto
love
eyes
all
things
seeming
prism
through
the
beautiful
retrospection
oh
my
heart
throbs
ever
wildly
half
in
joy
and
half
in
scorning
as
the
course
of
my
life
story
dimly
flits
across
my
mind
now
that
fate
seems
clear
and
steady
and
the
mist
that
veil
its
morning
has
resolved
into
bright
sunshine
with
the
azure
heaven
behind
and
i
cry
with
exultation
bless
he
who
feeling
in
him
precepts
of
pure
grace
and
beauty
guiding
on
his
willing
soul
yields
himself
unto
their
teaching
nor
lets
toil
nor
danger
win
him
to
forsake
the
race
he
runneth
till
he
resteth
at
the
goal
i
was
sprung
from
lineage
noble
with
a
spirit
inly
burning
to
uphold
my
name
and
honor
taintless
from
the
blast
of
shame
i
was
born
to
be
a
freeman
by
my
birthright
therefore
spurning
all
the
gilded
chains
of
fashion
that
make
freedom
but
a
name
from
the
forms
and
outward
emblems
of
the
spirit
nature
drew
i
inspiration
early
for
the
moulding
of
my
thought
strength
from
her
till
i
grew
unto
the
stature
of
a
man
nerved
to
accomplish
all
the
good
her
wisdom
taught
so
when
years
had
ripen
on
me
and
the
world
great
portals
yawning
bid
me
enter
the
enchanted
palace
of
youth
mystic
life
eager
breathless
to
explore
it
at
each
step
new
wonders
dawning
i
went
on
with
stedfast
courage
arm
alike
for
peace
or
strife
and
i
loved
that
i
might
ever
in
my
bosom
bear
a
treasure
strong
to
ransom
life
from
sorrow
strong
to
furnish
it
with
joy
so
i
sought
with
keenest
insight
neither
small
nor
scant
the
measure
to
content
my
requisition
purest
gold
without
alloy
and
i
found
it
lying
lowly
far
beneath
my
proud
line
dreaming
who
if
they
perchance
had
seen
it
would
with
scorn
have
away
but
i
sought
it
with
with
pride
for
to
my
seeming
a
pure
gem
is
worth
the
lifting
though
it
lie
amongst
the
clay
she
was
fair
a
lumin
beauty
rippling
each
chisell
feature
changing
ever
like
the
sunshine
playing
on
the
summer
sea
revelations
of
god
spirit
permeating
through
his
creature
making
loveliness
all
perfect
by
infused
divinity
what
to
me
though
all
her
were
the
wealth
of
love
and
kindness
and
a
heart
full
fraught
with
feelings
vein
with
gentleness
and
grace
which
the
worldling
holds
as
nothing
smitten
with
judicial
blindness
but
which
i
all
things
prizing
wed
her
in
the
weak
face
scared
my
kinsmen
were
and
bitter
for
the
shame
and
the
dishonour
said
they
i
had
brought
upon
them
and
the
noble
name
i
bore
and
my
sire
with
passion
burning
launch
his
deepest
curses
on
her
and
as
though
i
were
a
felon
drove
me
fiercely
from
his
door
i
was
destined
for
some
puppet
some
gold
image
of
his
choosing
doubtless
who
was
made
to
worship
like
the
golden
calf
of
old
with
no
merit
but
her
riches
but
such
shame
my
soul
refusing
i
was
cast
forth
without
blessing
poor
and
guideless
from
the
fold
poor
not
poor
for
she
went
with
me
pouring
still
with
patient
spirit
balm
upon
my
wounded
feelings
peace
upon
my
burning
soul
so
that
though
man
love
was
reft
me
was
the
better
to
inherit
that
which
far
transcends
man
favour
sentience
of
sweetest
dole
words
of
scorn
and
deep
contemning
gave
i
back
for
their
reviling
for
my
soul
waxed
wroth
within
me
to
be
judged
by
such
as
they
fools
so
sage
in
their
great
folly
that
they
shake
their
bells
and
smiling
with
an
imbecile
sneer
the
wise
of
heart
away
let
them
wear
their
masking
purple
threadbare
now
with
vilest
uses
all
the
ancient
gloss
and
brightness
faded
from
it
through
their
stains
may
be
disgraced
degraded
but
true
nobleness
loses
by
relinquishing
its
trappings
whilst
the
spirit
still
remains
did
i
shame
them
that
i
ceded
all
the
forms
and
false
adorning
that
doth
deck
them
for
their
stations
heedless
of
the
stuff
within
and
stood
forth
in
my
own
fashion
such
as
god
had
made
me
scorning
to
be
made
a
man
of
tinsel
to
be
honoured
for
my
kin
did
i
shame
them
that
rejoicing
in
the
freedom
of
my
spirit
i
asserted
all
its
fulness
spite
of
prejudice
and
pride
whilst
they
slaves
of
wealth
and
fashion
trembling
cowards
did
not
dare
it
would
not
risk
a
pointed
finger
to
gain
an
angel
bride
was
the
noble
name
they
cited
but
the
badge
of
slaves
and
vassals
bound
beyond
emancipation
to
obey
another
mood
better
far
to
be
a
peasant
the
shadow
of
their
castles
than
debase
the
soul
within
me
to
such
brutish
servitude
what
were
they
with
all
their
lordship
all
their
riches
measured
duly
that
they
looked
with
scorn
upon
her
in
her
unadornëd
worth
ashy
fruit
with
surface
golden
she
with
goodness
leavened
throughly
all
her
wealth
by
heaven
imparted
their
derived
alone
from
earth
oh
i
felt
a
high
compassion
for
their
warp
and
narrow
feelings
as
i
press
my
bride
unto
me
and
read
her
gentle
eyes
gaining
deeper
insight
daily
meeting
ever
new
revealings
of
the
grace
of
woman
spirit
and
her
holy
sympathies
so
we
pilgrim
on
together
buffeting
the
ills
about
us
sharing
hope
and
joy
and
sorrow
as
we
shared
our
daily
bread
keeping
still
a
pleasaunce
scathless
in
our
hearts
though
all
without
us
might
be
cheerless
desolation
and
the
sky
with
clouds
through
much
toil
and
tribulation
we
attain
at
last
to
honour
with
no
succour
from
my
kindred
i
upreared
my
house
alone
and
i
see
my
cherish
maiden
with
admiring
gazes
on
her
glide
amid
the
high
and
noble
with
a
grace
beyond
their
own
and
those
proud
ones
now
are
gracious
bowing
fawningly
before
her
whilst
she
with
her
true
eyes
calmly
takes
the
measure
of
their
hearts
weighs
aright
the
honied
speeches
and
the
praise
they
heap
upon
her
her
own
innocence
instinctively
disarming
all
their
arts
for
she
knows
their
tongues
are
venal
sold
to
flatter
wealth
and
power
and
to
crouch
with
serpent
homage
in
the
dust
at
fortune
shrine
ready
to
revile
and
slander
if
calamity
should
lower
and
to
flout
as
base
deceitful
what
they
late
had
termed
divine
thus
unmask
and
sifted
throughly
let
them
stoop
and
fawn
at
pleasure
little
reck
i
to
revenge
me
better
for
their
former
spite
as
i
mark
their
degradation
falling
on
them
in
full
measure
when
they
humble
themselves
vilely
thus
to
one
who
reads
them
right
the
stormy
petrel
far
in
the
wilderness
of
waves
where
vision
dieth
endless
motion
where
only
the
madden
raves
and
sinketh
its
chains
in
the
soundless
ocean
far
from
the
ken
and
the
power
of
men
and
lone
as
though
earth
were
in
chaos
again
the
stormy
petrel
cleaveth
the
air
and
maketh
the
surging
billow
its
lair
the
black
cloud
scuddeth
along
on
high
silent
and
swift
as
the
angel
death
led
by
euroclydon
through
the
sky
unto
its
victim
with
bated
breath
whilst
only
god
and
the
petrel
seeth
the
path
by
which
the
avenger
fleeth
and
with
shrill
accent
of
wail
and
mourning
riseth
the
petrel
wild
cry
of
warning
anon
the
bones
of
the
wreck
come
past
bitterly
mock
of
the
roaring
tide
from
wave
to
wave
in
derision
cast
with
scorn
and
jeers
at
poor
human
pride
and
still
the
petrel
with
lightning
sweep
circles
their
way
through
the
raging
deep
settling
in
awe
on
some
shatter
spar
and
tracking
its
course
as
it
drifts
afar
into
this
realm
of
the
winds
and
waves
man
cometh
not
with
his
living
soul
but
like
the
mounds
over
clammy
graves
over
his
body
the
surges
roll
no
mortal
weeper
hath
seen
his
tomb
buried
he
lies
in
eternal
gloom
save
that
the
petrel
with
wailing
cry
hover
around
as
he
floated
by
what
doth
the
petrel
so
far
away
from
the
home
of
love
and
the
field
of
strife
in
this
lone
spot
doth
the
petrel
stay
to
show
the
beauty
and
power
of
life
for
the
broad
earth
and
the
boundless
sea
time
and
the
endless
eternity
all
all
acknowledge
the
spirit
controul
and
like
the
frail
body
were
made
for
the
soul
to
when
the
stars
are
up
and
keeping
holy
vigils
in
the
skies
whilst
night
train
is
passing
slowly
footsteps
hush
and
voices
lowly
and
on
earth
sweet
dreams
are
steeping
slumbering
souls
in
paradise
in
my
heart
there
comes
a
vision
from
its
elysian
bent
upon
some
blessed
mission
and
its
form
resembleth
thee
in
thy
grace
and
purity
i
with
trancëd
rapture
gazing
scan
each
lineament
divine
trace
again
thy
pensive
sweetness

and

devoutly

at

evermore
within

like
a

thy
beauty
stealing
hushing
pain
and
sorrow
healing
and
i
pray
to
dream
for
ever
gazing
thus
and
waking
never
for
the
morn
comes
and
the
real
once
again
resumes
its
sway
scattereth
these
radiant
fancies
cloudeth
thy
gentle
glances
and
still
seeking
my
ideal
through

life
i
take
my
way
weary
longing

praying
much
yet
no

phantom

before
me
flying
leading

the
mermaid
a
mermaid
smoothing
her
sunny
hair
fanned
by
the
breath
of
the
summer
air
sang
to
me
love
wilt
thou
go
with
me
down
to
the
depths
of
the
purple
sea
maiden
ah
yes
i
will
go
with
thee
and
lap
my
soul
in
felicity
down
we
went
through
the
crystal
waters
evermore
waving
round
neptune
daughters
down
till
the
light
of
the
starry
sky
melted
away
like
an
echoed
sigh
and
the
rapt
breast
of
the
restless
ocean
sank
into
still
dreams
of
past
emotion
down
and
we
stood
on
a
pleasant
shore
paven
with
shells
from
the
naiad
store
shining
and
such
as
keep
the
mermaid
songs
for
their
balmy
sleep
flowers
there
were
set
with
sparkling
gems
gleaming
amid
the
white
coral
stems
and
flinging
their
measure
of
light
and
scent
up
through
the
translucent
firmament
and
as
the
air
by
a
bird
wing
laven
or
a
deep
pool
by
a
white
hand
waven
floated
the
swells
of
the
dewy
tide
round
the
and
me
beside
onward
we
went
where
a
diamond
portal
kept
the
pure
light
of
the
dawn
immortal
making
the
heart
sicken
to
win
the
halcyon
joys
it
enclosed
within
entered
we
under
its
arching
sweep
into
the
palace
hall
of
the
deep
where
the
vault
of
its
lofty
dome
have
the
nymphs
and
mermen
gay
their
home
there
sat
old
neptune
upon
his
throne
a
foaming
wave
that
was
turn
to
stone
and
round
about
him
his
merry
crew
with
brimming
cups
of
the
purple
dew
wandering
far
through
the
lumin
halls
where
light
was
bred
in
the
ruby
walls
stray
the
fair
naiads
with
golden
hair
that
wanton
about
in
the
perfumed
air
and
flowing
robes
round
their
white
limbs
waved
like
moonbeams
bright
into
substance
laved
neptune
in
tones
that
spread
far
and
wide
ho
ho
a
man
with
a
mermaid
bride
and
the
blue
dome
rung
with
cruel
laughter
till
all
the
arches
mutter
it
after
then
came
the
nymphs
in
a
radiant
string
and
circled
us
round
like
saturn
ring
forms
that
appearing
to
mortal
eyes
dazzle
them
so
that
the
spirit
dies
then
to
my
mermaid
old
neptune
saith
hymn
the
rash
mortal
unto
his
death
she
with
a
voice
that
murmuring
stole
deep
as
a
heaven
thought
into
my
soul
o
in
the
land
that
is
under
the
waves
to
dwell
with
my
love
in
the
coral
caves
to
bind
his
brows
with
a
diamond
zone
and
call
the
light
of
his
eyes
mine
own
to
roam
with
him
through
the
boundless
space
and
make
the
billow
our
resting
place
there
sing
our
songs
till
we
fall
asleep
and
dream
of
elysium
in
the
deep
waves
are
flowing
for
ever
and
ever
o
they
will
rock
us
for
ever
and
ever
hush
every
sorrow
to
quiet
rest
and
pillow
love
in
each
other
breast
o
they
will
sink
us
deeper
and
deeper
until
they
themselves
sleep
with
the
sleeper
until
there
is
only
love
awake
that
can
not
sleep
for
his
own
sweet
sake
come
in
my
bosom
then
come
with
me
down
to
the
depths
of
the
purple
sea
all
my
soul
thrill
and
panted
for
bliss
as
pilgrims
thirst
in
the
wilderness
i
cried
o
maiden
whose
softest
sighs
are
sweeter
than
all
earth
melodies
if
thou
wilt
wander
with
me
for
ever
and
naught
have
power
our
true
hearts
to
sever
i
shall
forget
all
that
earth
calls
fair
and
all
that
i
fondly
treasured
there
the
meadows
and
hills
and
sunny
dells
and
the
birds
and
fragrant
and
i
will
follow
thee
through
the
deep
where
waves
shall
rock
us
to
tender
sleep
all
powers
of
ocean
i
will
defy
and
follow
thee
though
it
be
but
to
die
neptune
then
youth
thou
hast
bravely
said
and
meet
art
thou
with
a
nymph
to
wed
so
thou
shalt
live
out
thy
little
span
unscathed
by
the
hands
of
the
blithe
merman
so
they
bound
me
fast
in
cruel
sleep
and
bore
me
silently
from
the
deep
and
have
i
seen
my
mermaid
more
though
oft
i
watch
for
her
on
the
shore
the
spirit
of
the
air
a
spirit
came
to
me
on
the
breeze
sweet
with
the
breath
of
the
orange
trees
floated
about
me
and
murmur
soft
o
poet
wilt
fly
with
me
far
aloft
and
i
will
show
thee
the
realms
of
space
where
the
lightning
can
find
no
resting
place
we
will
away
to
the
home
of
morn
and
see
the
first
youngling
sunbeams
born
we
will
away
to
the
cave
of
night
and
wake
the
echoes
to
sudden
fright
and
then
we
wander
among
the
stars
and
mark
the
roll
of
their
golden
cars
spirit
i
go
with
thee
through
the
sky
for
my
soul
pants
ever
to
soar
on
high
if
thou
wilt
bear
me
upon
thy
wings
and
guide
me
amid
our
bright
wanderings
swiftly
we
went
through
the
sunny
air
higher
than
ever
the
skylark
dare
and
the
bright
clouds
where
the
summer
beams
slumber
and
revel
in
golden
dreams
lay
far
beneath
us
like
dewy
fumes
hovering
over
the
higher
we
went
till
the
puny
earth
dwindled
away
to
an
atom
girth
and
the
record
of
our
rapid
way
was
the
far
death
of
a
starry
ray
then
we
drew
nigh
to
the
palace
bright
where
morning
treasures
her
dewy
light
cool
by
the
breath
of
the
angels
wings
and
sweet
with
their
musical
utterings
there
we
saw
the
young
awaken
and
the
earth
rays
from
their
soft
tresses
shaken
and
there
we
saw
the
sweet
zephyrs
rise
that
woo
the
flowers
with
gentle
sighs
and
kiss
the
mist
from
the
streamlet
tide
as
tears
are
kiss
from
a
happy
bride
the
angels
of
joy
and
bliss
were
there
lapt
in
the
folds
of
the
balmy
air
breathing
their
pæans
till
far
away
the
echoes
went
with
the
light
of
day
the
spirit
said
hence
the
ray
of
morn
like
a
poor
child
unto
sorrow
born
wends
to
the
earth
with
sweet
smiles
uplit
and
from
the
darkness
awakens
it
but
though
it
whisper
of
peace
and
love
and
tell
the
world
of
the
joys
above
they
will
not
hearken
unto
the
voice
whose
accents
faint
make
the
flowers
rejoice
but
still
grovel
on
in
strife
and
sorrow
and
make
the
signal
of
war
morrow
onward
we
went
through
the
heavens
afar
swift
as
the
course
of
a
shooting
star
until
dark
shadows
began
to
fall
around
our
way
like
a
funeral
pall
deeper
and
deeper
and
then
the
gloom
grew
thick
as
it
were
the
night
own
tomb
there
was
no
sound
save
the
rushing
wave
closing
the
furrow
our
passing
clave
there
was
no
sound
save
the
beating
heart
that
at
its
own
throbbings
seemed
to
start
there
was
no
sound
save
the
ebb
and
flow
of
my
own
breathing
drawn
long
and
low
then
the
gave
forth
a
cry
that
rang
through
the
arches
of
the
sky
whereat
a
myriad
echoes
leapt
forth
from
the
darkness
which
they
slept
shouted
an
answer
in
fierce
surprise
that
rumbled
far
into
faintest
sighs
then
slowly
sank
to
their
rest
again
and
left
the
night
to
her
silent
reign
on
we
went
whilst
the
sounds
grew
dimmer
till
stars
afar
began
to
glimmer
like
flashing
lights
on
a
lonely
mere
like
tapers
dim
round
a
sable
bier
onward
till
many
a
radiant
world
in
solemn
glory
across
us
whirl
shaking
the
air
in
their
mighty
march
like
thunder
beneath
its
prison
arch
ever
louder
the
swift
wind
bore
us
the
swell
of
their
eternal
chorus
filling
the
soul
of
the
boundless
sky
with
strains
of
adoring
harmony
past
us
came
mars
all
fiery
and
red
like
a
warrior
stain
with
the
blood
he
shed
and
his
voice
all
rang
clear
and
high
pealing
for
ever
truth
saturn
came
with
his
blazing
ring
like
a
crown
round
the
brows
of
a
titan
king
circled
by
many
a
satellite
that
made
his
pathway
through
heaven
bright
the
star
of
eve
like
a
maiden
sphere
gleaming
with
beauty
and
grace
drew
near
sweeping
along
heaven
panoply
the
sweetest
and
fairest
child
of
the
sky
onward
they
came
in
myriad
lines
from
space
whereon
the
sun
never
shines
but
fades
away
like
a
twinkling
star
orbs
whose
glory
is
greater
far
many
a
beautiful
world
appear
such
as
not
even
fancy
hath
rear
sinless
and
happy
as
heaven
will
be
and
stamp
with
the
seal
of
eternity
but
sadly
we
sank
to
earth
again
and
heard
the
discord
and
strife
of
men
like
a
harp
that
jars
from
a
sudden
fall
and
turns
to
discord
tones
musical
why
do
i
love
thee
is
not
because
thou
art
so
fair
so
beautiful
unto
the
sight
is
not
because
thy
silken
hair
curls
a
neck
of
spotless
white
is
not
because
thy
speaking
eye
claims
kindred
with
the
deep
blue
sky
alone
i
love
thee
no
is
because
around
thee
gleams
the
light
of
innocence
and
truth
adorning
with
its
radiant
beams
and
pure
reflex
the
charms
of
youth
because
thine
every
word
and
thought
with
thy
soul
gentleness
is
fraught
therefore
i
love
thee
lady
annabel
she
had
suitors
many
many
the
fair
lady
annabel
but
she
loved
him
more
than
any
for
she
knew
he
loved
her
well
she
was
rich
but
he
was
lowly
lowly
in
the
world
esteem
but
that
made
her
love
more
holy
as
the
darkness
gilds
the
beam
for
she
knew
his
manly
honour
all
the
beauties
of
his
mind
and
they
sweetly
stole
upon
her
like
the
scent
borne
on
the
wind
so
she
loved
him
ere
she
knew
it
ere
she
thought
to
close
her
heart
the
tender
spells
that
drew
it
evermore
to
take
his
part
when
in
idlesse
or
in
malice
others
lightly
spoke
of
him
careless
that
in
his
life
chalice
they
poured
sadness
to
the
brim
for
he
was
a
dreamer
throughly
feeding
on
sweet
poesie
and
few
knew
his
spirit
truly
and
none
prized
it
well
as
she
but
upon
the
thymy
mosses
with
wild
flowers
by
his
side
blossoms
that
the
summer
glosses
for
the
brow
of
fairy
bride
he
would
lie
and
weave
bright
fancies
from
the
maze
within
his
heart
which
her
gentle
smiles
and
glances
kindled
with
an
angel
art
for
a
firmament
of
beauty
hung
like
heaven
his
mind
and
it
seem
a
sacred
duty
to
hymn
all
the
fair
it
shrined
so
he
praised
her
golden
tresses
and
he
thought
them
fair
and
soft
as
the
locks
the
sun
caresses
on
bright
angels
far
aloft
and
her
eyes
so
blue
and
tender
made
for
love
to
glisten
through
that
their
gentleness
might
render
love
as
welcome
as
the
dew
and
her
cheeks
with
roses
blushing
and
her
lips
with
sunshine
drest
her
white
bosom
gently
hushing
with
its
swells
all
ill
to
rest
all
came
to
him
in
his
dreaming
like
things
from
another
sphere
till
bewildered
by
their
gleaming
he
felt
only
they
were
dear
must
he
perish
must
he
languish
for
the
love
of
one
so
fair
till
the
cruel
sting
of
anguish
change
a
blessing
to
despair
he
is
poor
and
favour
never
smiles
on
one
so
weak
as
he
poverty
still
comes
to
sever
all
hopes
of
felicity
but
she
loves
him
and
communion
with
his
soul
gives
strength
to
hers
so
they
blend
their
lives
in
union
careless
of
cold
fashion
slurs
she
resigns
what
earth
calls
treasure
titled
suitors
that
is
she
seeks
pleasure
for
she
knows
life
but
an
hour
far
too
short
and
full
of
sadness
far
too
full
of
grief
and
pain
for
the
heart
to
barter
gladness
for
a
shadow
or
for
gain
so
she
fondly
stood
beside
him
and
she
placed
her
hand
in
his
with
a
smile
that
seem
to
chide
him
for
the
shade
that
veil
his
bliss
as
he
thought
how
he
could
duly
make
return
for
all
her
love
only
could
he
serve
her
truly
love
her
as
the
light
above
and
she
said
we
will
live
gaily
in
some
sylvan
hermitage
worshipping
all
beauty
daily
till
my
foolish
heart
grow
sage
we
will
have
sweet
flowers
about
us
birds
to
sing

of

the

world
nobles
pillow
in
their
carriage
laugh
aloud
with
proud
lips
curled
and
fair
ladies
smiled
their
pity
with
a
sigh
for
mortal
folly
whilst
rich

in

frown

it

the
round
whose
brow
the

pure
ray
that
trembles
from
the
opening
gates
of
dawn
still
seems
to
circle
and
the
mossy
lawn
as
they
glide
gently
onward
ever
breathes
a
beauty
and
a
fragrance
which
enwreathes
within
the
being
until
every

with
a
strange
mystery
of
joy
is
fraught
and
where

forms
a

verdant
matting
the

chaunts
forth
her

through

through

from

was
wafted
near

the
soul
with
ravishment
more
sweet
than
thy
soft
tones
stealing
unto
the
seat
of
passion
waking
echoes
in
the
breast
of
love
and
purity
and
quiet
rest
murmuring
through
the
windings
of
the
soul
till
interpenetrated
is
the
whole
with
holy
harmonies
and
blissful
sense
of
joyance
and
straightway
is
refted
thence
all
baser
feeling
and
all
earthly
leaven
by
the
dear
magic
of
that
voice
from
heaven
fair
priestess
of
the
beautiful
that
bringest
missions
of
sweetness
from
above
and
flingest
in
a
rich
flood
of
song
now
faint
yet
clear
as
helicon
own
murmurs
to
the
ear
now
swelling
till
around
our
being
floats
in
thrilling
cadences
thy
notes
the
poetry
of
poetry
the
deep
mysterious
essences
whose
wavings
steep
life
in
the
bliss
of
angels
and
the
real
in
the
ethereal
hues
of
the
ideal
a
welcome
to
thee
heartfelt
as
the
lay
hymn
by
the
panting
lark
to
the
young
day
joyous
and
loving
as
the
sunny
beam
that
greets
the
early
primrose
when
the
dream
of
flowery
revels
through
the
noontide
hours
first
steals
upon
it
such
a
joy
is
ours
now
as
with
tones
our
spirits
hail
thy
glad
return
o
sweetest
nightingale
the
gold
seekers
ever
onward
sweep
the
nations
marching
with
a

train
prince

peasant
youth
and
maiden
toiling
struggling
life
plain
turning
from
the
land
that
bore
them
from
the
loving
ties
of
old
still
to
wander
weary
pilgrims
the
wide
world
after
gold
little
reck
they
of
the
dangers
little
reck
they
of
the
woes
urged
along
by
strong
endeavour
heedless
both
of
friends
and
foes
gazing
on
the
shadow
moving
at
their
sides
till
sun
hath
set
ever
to
their
spirit
courage
we
will
grasp
it
yet
over
plain
and
over
mountain
rocks
their
zeal
can
not
resist
up
the
rugged
heights
they
clamber
till
they
perish
in
the
mist
down
the
precipital
hollows
blindly
falling
as
they
speed
calling
still
with
dying
accents
on
their
fellows
to
take
heed
over
stream
and
trackless
ocean
with
the
hatching
nigh
ever
waiting
there
to
thunder
at
the
bidding
of
the
sky
tossing
on
the
angry
billow
heart
and
soul
beset
with
fear
yet
with
longing
all
unshaken
onward
through
the
blast
they
steer
over
marsh
and
sandy
desert
sinking
the
scorching
sun
hopeless
weary
madly
thirsting
slowly
dying
one
by
one
leaving
many
a
bone
to
whiten
by
the
wayside
and
to
tell
by
mortality
drear
how
its
surges
rose
and
fell
through
the
spring
and
through
the
summer
when
the
flowers
are
on
the
lea
through
the
autumn
when
the
blossoms
fade
and
wither
drearily
through
the
chill
and
ghostly
winter
when
the
year
is
in
its
shroud
and
corruption
preys
on
nature
stooping
fiercely
from
its
cloud
through
the
light
and
through
the
darkness
through
the
rain
and
through
the
snow
striving
onward
without
resting
seeking
it
above
below
in
the
earth
and
in
the
water
in
the
rock
and
in
the
clay
gathering
up
the
sandy
beaches
searching
sifting
them
away
never
resting
but
with
spirits
eager
breathless
to
attain
evermore
they
hurry
forward
to
their
purpose
life
plain
with
their
garments
waxen
olden
and
their
sandals
wearing
out
and
the
sinews
growing
weaker
that
once
bore
them
up
so
stout
with
the
vision
ever
dimmer
to
discern
the
cherish
prize
till
at
length
upon
the
highway
at
each
step
some
pilgrim
dies
his
glazed
eyes
still
feebly
turning
in
death
unto
the
goal
that
yet
glimmers
far
beyond
him
the
life
haven
of
his
soul
but
a
stalwart
phalanx
presseth
onward
still
with
hearts
serene
strong
in
faith
and
stedfast
courage
meeting
toil
with
dauntless
mien
working
out
their
primal
mission
through
the

and
through
the

for
the

that

like
rainbows
and
soft
dreams
that
are
the
caught
from
the
deep
of
elysian
sleep
the
poet
you
might
think
to
look
upon
them
with
their
arms
around
each
other
and
the
tale
that
he
is
breathing
softly
crimsoned
on
her
cheek
that
a
sweeter
spell
enwound
them
than
the
love
she
bears
a
brother
and
that
sweeter
words
are
spoken
than
the
words
that
brothers
speak
for
fair
one
she
loves
him
dearly
dearly
as
a
woman
spirit
full
of
gentleness
and
beauty
loves
all
pure
and
holy
things
just
as
though
some
blessëd
angel
screened
from
sight
were
floating
near
it
fanning
every
tender
feeling
into
motion
with
its
wings
so
she
hears
with
echoed
rapture
hopes
that
in
his
breast
are
swelling
of
the
glory
and
the
honour
that
have
sunned
his
poet
dream
charmed
him
by
their
bright
illusion
madly
from
his
quiet
dwelling
to
immerse
him
in
life
ocean
there
to
lose
him
like
a
stream
ay
look
in
her
eyes
poor
poet
kiss
the
tears
that
tremble
brightly
on
their
fringes
till
thou
them
her
pure
soul
for
thee
they
are
true
ones
they
are
fond
ones
and
that
vision
coming
nightly
may
refresh
thee
like
a
fountain
rising
sterility
backward
from
her
upturned
beauty
did
he
smooth
the
golden
tresses
that
fell
round
the
softness
of
her
cheek
was
a
frank
one
and
a
fair
one
with
the
grace
that
truth
impresses
beaming
it
without
shadow
so
he
gazed
but
did
not
speak
then
he
whispered
bright
may
dear
may
in
the
world
where
i
am
going
going
it
may
be
unwisely
but
some
magic
draws
me
on
there
to
win
the
fame
and
honour
with
whose
fire
my
soul
is
glowing
thou
shalt
be
my
guiding
angel
thou
shalt
be
my
helicon
i
will
paint
thee
in
my
verses
thee
so
beautiful
and
tender
till
that
world
shall
thrill
with
pleasure
and
pure
hearts
shall
cherish
thee
bright
may
dear
may
they
will
love
thee
and
thy
gentleness
shall
render
earth
again
a
sunny
eden
dedicate
to
poesy
they
will
crown
me
for
beauty
they
will
love
me
for
sweetness
they
will
shrine
my
name
in
glory
hear
it
like
a
household
thing
they
will
feel
the
spell
of
beauty
think
of
heaven
for
thy
meetness
thus
i
do
the
poet
mission
thou
an
angel
ministring
so
he
went
into
the
wide
world
with
bright
hopes
around
him
playing
youth
to
make
his
footsteps
buoyant
and
firm
trust
to
nerve
his
heart
fame
and
glory
clear
before
him
like
a
sun
the
path
arraying
witless
that
the
golden
vision
of
his
dreams
could
ere
depart
ii
there
are
thousands
in
the
highways
buffeting
the
waves
beside
them
struggling
onward
without
respite
in
pursuit
of
sandbuilt
gain
there
are
thousands
sinking
daily
but
the
selfish
crowd
deride
them
only
hurry
on
the
swifter
there
no
time
to
pity
pain
ah
what
hope
for
thee
poor
poet
in
the
race
that
they
are
running
when
the
jar
of
stormy
passions
makes
thy
temples
wildly
beat
thou
wrestle
with
the
torrent
thou
stand
against
their
cunning
who
will
crush
thee
without
mercy
like
a
flower
beneath
their
feet
wherefore
thou
leave
thy
dwelling
the
calm
and
pleasant
places
where
no
sorrow
came
to
rouse
thee
from
the
heaven
of
thy
dreams
where
the
gave
thee
music
and
the
path
the
wild
bee
traces
for
its
sweetness
thou
follow
or
repose
by
gentle
streams
o
poor
world
immersed
in
folly
o
dull
world
that
will
not
hearken
to
the
music
of
a
poet
singing
of
the
beautiful
close
your
heart
against
its
teaching
though
it
be
so
sweet
and
darken
all
the
sunshine
of
the
spirit
by
the
coldness
of
your
rule
who
would
bid
us
draw
the
curtain
that
conceals
the
poet
sorrow
who
would
need
to
his
anguish
when
they
look
upon
his
brow
it
is
written
there
in
tracings
far
more
true
than
tongue
could
borrow
it
is
brimming
in
his
glances
once
so
bright
so
woeful
now
gaze
upon
him
dost
thou
know
him
to
his
home
returning
for
his
step
is
very
feeble
and
his
cheek
is
very
pale
and
amid
it
like
a
sunset
is
the
hectic
burning
ye
who
know
no
shatter
gaze
upon
him
there
the
tale
o
the
holy
love
of
woman
o
the
gentle
love
of
woman
breathing
like
a
balmy
zephyr
on
the
fever
brows
of
care
centrate
sweetness
of
all
sweetness
only
in
its
sorrow
human
joy
without
you
were
a
phantom
grief
without
you
were
despair
see
how
tenderly
she
leads
him
with
her
arm
around
him
pressing
as
to
shield
him
from
the
rough
world
that
had
wrought
him
so
much
woe
and
his
eyes
are
filled
with
moisture
scarcely
can
he
breathe
his
blessing
but
she
feels
it
in
the
throbbing
of
his
full
heart
as
they
go
gaze
again
into
her
kind
eyes
gaze
into
them
weary
poet
fill
thy
soul
with
holy
calmness
from
the
fountain
of
her
love
if
there
peace
for
thy
poor
spirit
in
this
earth
they
will
bestow
it
for
she
is
a
gentle
angel
sent
to
bless
thee
from
above
and
she
said
as
she
bent
him
half
in
language
half
in
glances
for
there
is
a
hidden
meaning
far
too
deep
for
words
to
tell
we
will
dwell
she
said
with
nature
nourishing
all
gentle
fancies
and
the
lark
shall
be
our
minstrel
and
the
flowers
shall
love
us
well
so
he
smiled
upon
her
gently
with
a
glance
more
sad
than
weeping
that
a
bitter
thrill
ran
through
her
like
a
harp
struck
suddenly
and
she
thought
upon
the
summer
with
cold
shadows
it
creeping
and
she
thought
upon
the
flowers
fading
on
the
mossy
lea
but
she
turn
her
till
the
paleness
and
the
tears
that
would
be
flowing
faded
from
her
that
they
might
not
be
the
mirrors
of
his
own
smiling
comfort
on
him
ever
evermore
as
they
were
going
for
she
said
ah
there
are
none
to
smile
on
him
but
i
alone
iii
he
is
lying
in
the
sunshine
with
the
blithe
birds
round
him
singing
there
are
flowers
beside
his
pillow
there
are
flowers
beneath
his
feet
summer
pours
her
treasures
round
him
like
a
gentle
maiden
flinging
fragrant
blossoms
from
her
bosom
a
path
to
make
it
sweet
she
is
kneeling
in
the
sunshine
with
the
radiant
glory
her
and
his
palm
is
on
her
tresses
her
are
folded
on
her
breast
he
were
very
calm
and
happy
only
for
the
love
he
bore
her
which
was
far
too
sweet
a
feeling
to
resign
it
for
rest
bright
may
dear
may
draw
still
nearer
nearer
dear
may
till
my
spirit
sun
itself
within
your
brightness
as
the
lark
doth
in
the
day
soon
the
air
will
be
so
lumined
that
my
weakness
will
not
bear
it
so
i
gather
new
strength
from
thee
to
support
me
on
my
way
there
are
tears
within
your
eyes
may
let
me
kiss
them
from
your
eyes
may
they
will
taste
as
sweet
to
me
as
do
the
dews
upon
the
rose
dear
eyes
how
i
love
them
they
oft
tell
me
of
the
skies
may
tell
me
secrets
of
the
blessed
more
than
mortal
spirit
knows
ah
i
knew
not
in
the
old
time
half
the
sweetness
that
doth
linger
round
the
simple
things
of
nature
which
the
proud
heart
passes
by
now
i
see
there
not
a
wildflower
but
doth
point
with
warning
finger
to
the
unobservant
passer
truths
of
immortality
bright
may
thou
shalt
be
my
beadsman
and
thy
golden
tresses
drooping
round
thee
shall
be
all
the
vesture
that
my
loving
soul
shall
seek
thou
shalt
be
a
meet
confessor
for
a
lowly
poet
stooping
to
breathe
forth
his
secret
failings
and
read
pardon
on
thy
cheek
bright
may
i
have
been
a
strayer
from
the
narrow
path
that
wanders
through
this
world
to
lead
the
traveller
to
a
glad
eternity
i
have
been
an
erring
madman
for
the
blind
heart
never
ponders
till
the
fancied
light
it
follows
lead
it
from
felicity
i
have
been
most
false
and
perjured
false
to
all
a
poet
duty
even
whilst
my
heart
was
boasting
proudly
of
a
poet
creed
i
have
loudly
claimed
the
title
of
a
worshipper
of
beauty
yet
could
gaze
upon
a
flower
till
i
thought
it
but
a
weed
yes
i
dwelt
amid
the
woodlands
with
bright
streamlets
singing
round
me
sunny
dells
alleys
and
cool
shades
to
ramble
in
all
was
happy
all
was
peaceful
yet
there
ambition
found
me
charm
me
forth
into
the
rough
world
to
engulph
me
in
its
din
yes
i
wearied
of
the
woodlands
of
the
streams
and
sunny
places
where
i
lay
me
in
the
summer
to
dream
all
the
noontide
like
the
child
of
a
sweet
mother
lapt
within
her
fond
embraces
drawing
fitness
from
her
beauty
to
lisp
forth
in
poet
lore
but
the
time
is
drawing
nigh
now
when
my
soul
sublimed
from
folly
shall
see
all
things
in
their
trueness
with
no
drawn
between
know
that
glory
is
mere
weakness
and
that
aim
alone
is
holy
which
wrought
out
in
life
with
patience
fits
man
for
a
higher
scene
evening
far
away
in
western
ether
day
and
night
at
length
have
met
like
old
friends
that
come
together
and
their
eyes
with
tears
are
wet
in
the
heart
too
joy
and
sorrow
meet
together
without
pain
loving
friends
who
on
the
morrow
at
the
dawning
part
again
is
the
time
for
sweet
contentment
thoughts
all
dedicate
to
love
soften
down
from
all
resentment
chasten
as
the
light
above
is
the
time
to
breathe
a
blessing
forth
on
all
things
good
and
fair
that
make
life
so
sweet
repressing
like
a
charm
the
strokes
of
care
tis
the
time
when
those
who
love
us
rise
like
stars
in
fancy
sky
shining
steadily
above
us
though
afar
in
seeming
nigh
sure
our
life
is
but
a
gloaming
slowly
unto
night
to
give
rest
unto
the
roaming
to
the
sad
dreams
of
delight
should
not
then
be
contentment
only
dedicate
to
love
softened
down
from
all
resentment
holy
as
the
light
above
life
many
a
bright
and
pleasant
vision
hath
the
heart
in
youth
visions
that
the
wizard
fancy
conjures
by
sweet
necromancy
ever
robed
in
hues
elysian
from
the
world
of
truth
many
a
bright
and
pleasant
vision
cheers
the
heart
of
youth
just
as
though
the
curtain
parted
from
the
life
unseen
and
a
portion
of
its
gladness
unalloy
by
any
sadness
the
ripening
spirit
darted
like
the
morning
sheen
making
us
awhile
and
our
sky
serene
many
a
pleasure
from
the
real
hath
our
manly
prime
though
the
mystic
light
is
shaded
and
the
rosy
dreams
have
faded
for
our
strengthen
spirits
see
all
things
matured
by
time
growing
out
of
the
ideal
unto
truth
sublime
blossom
unto
fruitage
golden
hope
to
certainty
all
things
by
divine
transition
keeping
pace
with

springing
from
the
olden
as
we
pass
them
by
climbing
still
by
faith
upholden
onward
to
the

many
a
pleasant
recollection
hath
the
heart
of
age
that
life
tide
hath
staunchly
breasted
wrought
achieved
and
nobly
rested
musing
with
calm
retrospection
their
past
pilgrimage
many
a
sweet
and
wise
reflection
hath
the
heart
of
age
looking
forward
dreaming
ever
of
the
better
land
waiting
for
the
promised
glory
that
shall
bind
their

with
a
brightness
fading
never
on
that
holy
strand
crowning

a
bounteous

sorrow
through
the
earth
a
spirit
goeth
onward
still
from
morn
till
night
silent
as
the
floweth
out
of
darkness
into
light
and
her
heart
is
very
tender
full
of
love
and
kindliness
yearning
evermore
to
render

fond
embraces
playing
round
her
as

goes
with
no
shade
on
their
glad
faces
deeper
than
the
budding
rose
a
maiden
dreaming
of
her
lover
like
a
star
amid
the
night
felt
the
spirit
bend
above
her
in
between
her
and

light
and

quivered
back
in
terror
from
the
spirit
offered
kiss
ah
how
often
thus
doth
error
backward
fright
our
souls
from
bliss
then

ah
thou
dearest
wilt
thou
close
thy
heart
from
me
through
the
shadow
that
thou
fearest

own

will
shine
on
thee

after

bent
to
meet
her
for

through

they
meet
in
one
dim
bourne
their
hoary
summits
with
cloudy
chaplets
such
as
might
have
bound
the
thunderer
when

fell

from

throne

shining
upon

noontide

golden
light

the
upheaving
waters
till
each
swell
is
tremulous
with
glory

strange
fancies
which
no

there
is
a
spell
by
which
the
panting
soul
shakes
from
its
stainless
pinions
all
the
gyves
wherewith
our
frail
mortality
still
strives
to
bind
it
downward
its
stern
controul
when
springing
from
the
earth
like
the
sweet
lark
that
wings
its
flight
in
music
to
the
sky
amid
the
spheres
it
wanders
where
the
eye
trembles
to
blindness
and
the
last
faint
spark
of
earth
far
gleaming
flickers
and
expires
thine
is
the
charm
dear
poesy
which
sets
the
cagëd
spirit
on
its
heavenward
flight
and
fills
its
being
with

pure
desires

aspirations

springs
many
a
false
mirage

joy

fades
before

pursue
the
empty
picture
which
our
fancy
drew
o
thou
my

not
the
empty
shows
and
gilded
nothings
of
this
little

let
thine
endless
effort
be
to
climb
above

petty
vanities
and
woes
unto
a
nobler
range
of
feelings
joys
which
no

leaven
of
decay
alloys

increase

through
