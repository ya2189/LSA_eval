for
i
was
a
gaunt
grave
councillor
being
in
all
things
wise
and
very
old
but
i
have
put
aside
this
folly
and
the
cold
that
old
age
weareth
for
a
cloak
i
was
quite
strong
at
least
they
said
so
the
young
men
at
the
but
i
have
put
aside
this
folly
being
gay
in
another
fashion
that
more
suiteth
me
i
have
curled
mid
the
boles
of
the
ash
wood
i
have
hidden
my
face
where
the
oak
spread
his
leaves
over
me
and
the
yoke
of
the
old
ways
of
men
have
i
cast
aside
by
the
still
pool
of
have
i
found
me
a
bride
that
was
a
tree
some
syne
she
hath
called
me
from
mine
old
ways
she
hath
hushed
my
rancour
of
council
bidding
me
praise
naught
but
the
wind
that
flutters
in
the
leaves
she
hath
drawn
me
from
mine
old
ways
till
men
say
that
i
am
mad
but
i
have
seen
the
sorrow
of
men
and
am
glad
for
i
know
that
the
wailing
and
bitterness
are
a
folly
and
i
i
have
put
aside
all
folly
and
all
grief
i
wrapped
my
tears
in
an
ellum
leaf
and
left
them
under
a
stone
and
now
men
call
me
mad
because
i
have
thrown
all
folly
from
me
putting
it
aside
to
leave
the
old
barren
ways
of
men
because
my
bride
is
a
pool
of
the
wood
and
though
all
men
say
that
i
am
mad
it
is
only
that
i
am
glad
very
glad
for
my
bride
hath
toward
me
a
great
love
that
is
sweeter
than
the
love
of
women
that
plague
and
burn
and
drive
one
away
is
true
that
i
am
gay
quite
gay
for
i
have
her
alone
here
and
no
man
troubleth
us
once
when
i
was
among
the
young
men
and
they
said
i
was
quite
strong
among
the
young
men
once
there
was
a
woman
but
i
forget
she
was
i
hope
she
will
not
come
again
i
do
not
remember
i
think
she
hurt
me
once
but
that
was
very
long
ago
i
do
not
like
to
remember
things
any
more
i
like
one
little
band
of
winds
that
blow
in
the
ash
trees
here
for
we
are
quite
alone
here
mid
the

is
listed
well
some
score
years
hence
behold
mine
audience
as
we
had
seen
him
yesterday
scrawny
out
at
heels
such
an
one
as
the
world
feels
a
sort
of
curse
against
its
guzzling
and
its
wallow
for
red
greed
and
yet
full
speed
though
it
should
run
for
its
own
getting
will
turn
aside
to
sneer
at
he
hath
no
coin
no
will
to
snatch
the
aftermath
of
mammon
such
an
one
as
women
draw
away
from
for
the
tobacco
ashes
scattered
on
his
coat
and
sith
his
throat
show
razor
unfamiliarity
and
three
days
beard
such
an
one
picking
a
ragged
backless
copy
from
the
stall
too
cheap
for
cataloguing
loquitur
the
strange
rare
name
he
must
be
rare
if
even
have
not
and
lost
such
age
as
his
pardons
the
habit
he
analyzes
form
and
thought
to
see
how
i
immortality
scriptor
ignotus
ferrara
to
when
i
see
thee
as
some
poor
battering
its
wings
against
this
cage
we
today
then
would
i
speak
comfort
unto
thee
from
out
the
heights
i
dwell
in
when
that
great
sense
of
power
is
upon
me
and
i
see
my
greater
bending
sibylwise
with
that
great
forty
year
epic
that
you
know
of
yet
unwrit
but
as
some
child
toy
my
fingers
and
see
the
sculptors
of
new
ages
carve
me
thus
and
model
with
the
music
of
my
couplets
in
their
hearts
surely
if
in
the
end
the
epic
and
the
small
kind
deed
are
one
if
to
god
the
child
toy
and
the
epic
are
the
same
so
did
one
make
a
child
toy
he
might
wright
it
well
and
cunningly
that
the
child
might
keep
it
for
his
children
children
and
all
have
joy
thereof
dear
an
this
dream
come
true
then
shall
all
men
say
of
thee
she
was
that
played
him
power
at
life
morn
and
at
the
twilight
evensong
and
god
peace
dwelt
in
the
mingled
chords
she
drew
from
out
the
shadows
of
the
past
and
old
world
melodies
that
else
he
had
known
only
in
his
dreams
of
iseult
and
of
beatrice
dear
an
this
dream
come
true
i
who
being
poet
only
can
give
thee
poor
words
only
add
this
one
poor
other
tribute
this
thing
men
call
immortality
a
gift
i
give
thee
even
as
ronsard
gave
it
seeing
before
time
one
sweet
face
grown
old
and
seeing
the
old
eyes
grow
bright
from
out
the
border
of
her
wrinkles
as
she
should
make
boast
unto
her
maids
ronsard
hath
sung
the
beauty
beauty
of
the
days
that
i
was
fair
so
hath
the
boon
been
given
by
the
poets
of
old
time
dante
to
beatrice
an
i
profane
not
yet
with
my
lesser
power
shall
i
not
strive
to
give
it
thee
all
ends
of
things
are
with
him
from
whom
are
all
things
in
their
essence
if
my
power
be
lesser
shall
my
striving
be
less
keen
but
rather
more
if
i
would
reach
the
goal
take
then
the
striving
and
if
for
so
the
florentine
hath
writ
when
having
put
all
his
heart
into
his
youth
dear
book
he
yet
strove
to
do
more
honour
to
that
lady
dwelling
in
his
inmost
soul
he
would
wax
yet
greater
to
make
her
earthly
glory
more
though
sight
of
hell
and
heaven
were
price
thereof
if
so
it
be
his
will
with
whom
are
all
things
and
through
whom
are
all
things
good
will
i
make
for
thee
and
for
the
beauty
of
thy

him
there

many
singers
greater
than
thou
but
his
answer
cometh
as
winds
and
as
lutany
as
a
vague
crying
upon
the
night
that
leaveth
me
no
rest
saying
ever
song
a
song
their
echoes
play
upon
each
other
in
the
twilight
seeking
ever
a
song
lo
i
am
worn
with
travail
and
the
wandering
of
many

made
my

dark
red
circles

there
is
a
trembling

with
him
there

greater

in
the
morn
of
my
years
there
came
a
woman
as
moon
light
calling
as
the
moon
calleth
the
tides
song
a
song
wherefore
i
made
her
a
song
and
she
went
from
me
as
the
moon
doth
from
the

but
still
came
the

saying
the
soul
sendeth

in

i
cried
unto
them
i
have
no
song
for
she
i
sang
of
hath
gone
from
me
but
my
soul
sent
a
woman
a
woman
of
the
wonder
folk
a
woman
as
fire
upon
the
pine
woods
crying
song
a
song
as
the
flame
crieth
unto
the
sap
my
song
was
ablaze
with
her
and
she
went
from
me
as
flame
leaveth
the
embers
so
went
she
unto
new
forests
and
the
words
were
with
me
crying
ever
song
a
song
and
i
i
have
no
song
till
my
soul
sent
a
woman
as
the
sun
yea
as
the
sun
calleth
to
the
seed

the

his

were

they
always
were
after
their
fashion
kindred
of
the

i
found
him
it
is
very
long
that
i
had
sought
among
the
nets
and
when
i
asked
the
fishermen
they
laughed
at
me
i
sought
long
days
amid
the
cliffs
thinking
to
find
the
of
him
and
then
there
at
the
blue
my
joy
grew
pain
for
suddenness
to
see
him
whither
he
went
i
may
not
come
it
seems
he
is
become
estranged
from
all
the
rest
and
all
the
sea
is
now
his
and
he
may
sink
unto
strange
depths
he
tells
me
of
that
have
no
light
as
we
it
deem
now
he
speaks
strange
words
i
did
not
know
one
half
the
substance
of
his
speech
with
me
and
then
when
i
saw
naught
he
sudden
leaped
and
shot
a
gleam
of
silver
down
away
and
i
have
spent
three
days
upon
this
rock
and
yet
he
comes
no
more
he
did
not
even
seem
to
know
i
watched
him
gliding
through
the
vitreous
deep
ii
they
chide
me
that
the
skein
i
used
to
spin
holds
not
my
interest
now
they
mock
me
at
the
route
well
i
have
come
again
last
night
i
saw
three
white
forms
move
out
past
the
utmost
wave
that
bears
the
white
foam
crest
i
somehow
knew
that
he
was
one
of
them
oimè
oimè
i
think
each
time
they
come
up
from
the
sea
heart
to
the
realm
of
air
they
are
more
from
the
shore
when
first
i
found
him
here
he
slept
as
he
might
after
a
long
night
taking
on
the
deep
and
when
he
woke
some
whit
the
old
kind
smile
dwelt
round
his
lips
and
held
him
near
to
me
but
then
strange
gleams
shot
through
the
eyes
as
though
he
saw
beyond
and
saw
not
me
and
when
he
moved
to
speak
it
troubled
him
and
then
he
plucked
at
grass
and
bade
me
eat
and
then
forgot
me
for
the
sea
its
charm
and
leapt
him
in
the
wave
and
so
was
gone
iii
i
wonder
why
he
mocked
me
with
the
grass
i
know
not
any
more
how
long
it
is
since
i
have
dwelt
not
in
my

house
i
know
they
think
me
mad
for
all
night
long
i
haunt
the
thinking
i
may
find
some
day
the

he
offered
unto
me
perhaps
he
did
not
jest
they
say
some
simples
have
more
power
than
old
wives
draw
from
them
perhaps
found
i
this
grass
he
come
again
perhaps
is
some
strange
charm
to
draw
him
here
which
he
may
not
leave
his
crew
that
ride
the

some

no

is
who
cometh
first
out
of
mine
for
i
am
homesick
after
mine
own
kind
and
ordinary
people
touch
me
not
yea
i
am
homesick
after
mine
own
kind
that
know
and
feel
and
have
some
breath
for
beauty
and
the
arts
aye
i
am
wistful
for
my
kin
of
the
spirit
and
have
none
about
me
save
in
the
shadows
when
come
surging
of
power
daemon
quasi
kaloun
says
beauty
is
most
that
a
calling
to
the
soul
well
then
so
call
they
the
swirlers
out
of
the
mist
of
my
soul
they
that
come
mewards
bearing
old
magic
but
for
all
that
i
am
home
sick
after
mine
own
kind
and
would
meet
kindred
as
i
am
bearing
the
secret
all
they
that
with
strange
sadness
have
the
earth
in
and
are
kind
to
all
my
fellows
aye
i
know
the
glory
of
th
unbounded
ones
but
ye
that
hide
as
i
hide
most
the
while
and
burst
forth
to
the
windows
only
whiles
or
whiles
for
love
or
hope
or
beauty
or
for
power
then
smoulder
with
the
lids
half
closed
and
are
untouched
by
echoes
of
the
world
oh
ye
my
fellows
with
the
seas
between
us
some
be
purple
and
sapphire
for
the
silver
shafts
of
sun
and
spray
all
shattered
at
the
bows
of
such
a
veltro
of
the
vasty
deep
as
bore
my
tortoise
house
scant
years
agone
and
some
the
hills
hold
off
the
little
hills
to
east
us
though
here
we
have
damp
and
plain
to
be
our
shutting
in
and
yet
my
soul
sings
up
and
we
are
one
yea
thou
and
thou
and
thou
and
all
my
kin
to
whom
my
breast
and
arms
are
ever
warm
for
that
i
love
ye
as
the
wind
the
trees
that
holds
their
blossoms
and
their
leaves
in
cure
and
calls
the
utmost
singing
from
the
boughs
that
him
save
the
aspen
were
as
dumb
still
shade
and
bade
no
whisper
speak
the
birds
of
how
beyond
beyond
beyond
there
lies
guillaume
de
lorris
belated
a
vision
of
italy
wisdom
set
apart
from
all
desire
a
hoary
nestor
with
youth
own
glad
eyes
him
met
i
at
the
style
and
all
benign
he
greeted
me
an
equal
and
i
knew
by
this
his
lack
of
pomp
he
was
himself
is
companion
unto
him
and
serves
his
trencherman
and
i
a
thousand
beauties
there
beheld
and
he
and
they
made
merry
endlessly
and
love
was
rayed
between
them
as
a
mist
and
yet
so
fine
and
delicate
a
haze
it
did
impede
the
eyes
no
whit
unless
it
were
to
make
the
halo
round
each
one
appear
more
marvellous
than
any
pearled
and
ruby
diadem
the
courts
o
earth
ha
known
slender
as
maids
and
hamadryads
did
meseem
these
shapes
that
ministered
these
formed
harmonies
with
eyes
and
first
the
cities
of
north
italy
i
did
behold
each
as
a
woman
and
svelte
verona
first
i
met
at
eve
and
in
the
dark
we
kissed
and
then
the
way
bore
us
somewhile
apart
and
yet
my
heart
keeps
tryst
with
her
so
every
year
our
thoughts
are
interwove
as
fingers
were
such
times
as
eyes
see
much
and
tell
and
she
that
loved
the
master
years
agone
that
bears
his
signet
in
her
signor
square
che
lo
glorifico
she
spread
her
arms
and
in
that
deep
embrace
all
thoughts
of
woe
were
perished
and
of
pain
and
weariness
and
all
the
wrack
of
thoughts
and
that
our
intelligence
doth
gain
by
strife
against
itself
of
things
we
have
not
yet
the
earnèd
right
to
clearly
see
and
all
yea
all
that
dust
doth
symbolize
was
there
forgot
and
my
enfranchised
soul
grew
as
the
liquid
elements
and
was
infused
with
joy
that
is
not
light
nor
might
nor
harmony
and
yet
hath
part
and
quality
of
all
these
three
whereto
is
added
calm
past
earthly
peace
thus
with
verona
spirit
and
all
time
swept
on
beyond
my
ken
and
as
the
sea
hath
in
no
wise
a
form
within
itself
as
liquid
hath
no
form
save
where
it
bounden
is
by
some
enshrouding
chalice
of
hard
things
as
wine
its
graven
goblet
and
the
sea
its
basalt
for
a
bordering
so
had
my
thought
and
now
my
thought
remembrance
no
of
whatso
there
passed
for
this
long
space
the
horny
gate
and
when
that
age
was
done
and
the
transfusion
of
all
my
self
through
her
and
she
through
me
i
did
perceive
that
she
enthroned
two
things
verona
and
a
maid
i
knew
on
earth
and
dulled
some
while
from
dream
and
then
become
that
lower
thing
deductive
intellect
i
saw
how
all
things
are
but
symbols
of
all
things
and
each
of
many
do
we
know
but
the
equation
governing
and
in
my
rapture
at
this
vision
scope
i
saw
no
end
or
bourn
to
what
things
mean
so
praised
pythagoras
and
once
more
raised
by
this
said
rapture
to
the
house
of
dream
beheld
fenicè
as
a
drift
through
the
purple
of
the
wedded
sea
and
grow
a
wraith
and
then
a
she
and
knew
her
name
was
and
hailed
her
princess
of
the
opiates
and
guessed
her
evil
and
her
good
thereby
and
then
a
maid
of
nine
pavia
hight
passed
with
a
laugh
that
was
all
mystery
and
when
i
turned
to
her
she
reached
me
one
clear
chalice
of
white
wine
pressed
from
the
recent
grapes
that
yet
were
hung
adown
her
shoulders
and
were
bound
right
cunningly
about
her
elfish
brows
so
hale
a
draught
the
life
of
every
grape
lurked
without
ferment
in
the
amber
cloud
and
memory
this
wine
was
of
all
good
and
more
i
might
have
seen
firenza
goito
or
that
proudest
gate
ligurian
genoa
cornelia
of
colombo
of
far
sight
that
man
and
seer
in
one
had
well
been
twain
and
each
a
glory
to
his
hills
and
sea
and
past
her
a
great
band
bright
garlanded
or
rich
with
purple
skeins
and
crimson
mantles
and
queynt
fineries
that
tarnished
held
but
so
the
more
of
dim
allurement
in
their
folds
so
swept
my
vision
their
filmy
ranks
then
rose
some
opaque
cloud
whose
name
i
have
not
yet
discerned
and
music
as
i
heard
it
one
clear
night
within
our
earthly
night
own
mirroring
san
pietro
by
adige
where
altar
candles
blazed
out
as
dim
stars
and
all
the
gloom
was
soft
and
shadowy
forms
made
and
sang
god
within
the
choir
and
in
a
clear
space
high
behind
them
and
the
tabernacle
of
that
place
two
tapers
shew
the
master
of
the
keys
as
some
white
power
pouring
forth
itself
and
all
the
church
rang
low
and
murmured
thus
in
my
dream
of
forms
the
music
swayed
and
i
was
lost
in
it
and
only
woke
when
something
like
a
mass
bell
rang
and
then
that
wind
pale
dawn
annunciatrice
me
bore
to
earth
again
but
some
strange
peace
i
had
not
known
so
well
before
this
swevyn
clung
round
my
head
and
made
me
hate

see
end
of

a
vision
of
italy
in
the
old
age
of
the
soul
i
do
not
choose
to
dream
there
cometh
on
me
some
strange
old
lust
for
deeds
as
to
the
nerveless
hand
of
some
old
warrior

or
the
wonted
helmet
brings
momentary
life

to
my
soul
grown

grown
old
with

a
jousting
many
a
foray
grown
old
with
many
a
and
till
now
they
send
him
dreams
and
no
more
deed
so
doth
he
flame
again
with
might
for
action
forgetful
of
the
council
of
the
elders
forgetful
that
who
rules
doth
no
more
battle
forgetful
that
such
might
no
more
cleaves
to
him

doth
he
flame

to
wander
in

ways
of

and
clang
thereof
and
manifold
be
now
my
need
whoso
combine
such
works
love

among
the
only
bit
of

that
has
come
down
to
us
and
through
its
being
printed
with
the
songs
of

is
like
to
lose

from

marvoil
a
poor
clerk
i
arnaut
the
less
they
call
me
and
because
i
have
small
mind
to
sit
day
long
long
day
cooped
on
a
stool
o
figures
for
maitre
jacques
polin
i
ha
taken
to
rambling
the
south
here
the
vicomte
of
beziers
not
such
a
bad
lot
i
made
rimes
to
his
lady
this
three
year
vers
and
canzone
till
that
damn
son
of
aragon
alfonso
the
took
to
hanging
helmet
at
beziers
then
came
what
might
come
to
wit
three
men
and
one
woman
beziers
off
at
i
and
his
lady
singing
the
stars
in
the
turrets
of
beziers
and
one
lean
aragonese
cursing
the
seneschal
to
the
end
that
you
see
friends
aragon
cursing
in
aragon
beziers
busy
at
beziers
bored
to
an
inch
of
extinction
tibors
all
tongue
and
temper
at
me
in
this
damn
inn
of
avignon
stringing
long
verse
for
the
burlatz
all
for
one
king
of
the
aragonese
alfonso
quatro
and
if
when
i
am
dead
they
take
the
trouble
to
tear
out
this
wall
here
they
know
more
of
arnaut
of
marvoil
than
half
his
canzoni
say
of
him
as
for
will
and
testament
i
leave
none
save
this
vers
and
canzone
to
the
countess
of
beziers
in
return
for
the
first
kiss
she
gave
me
may
her
eyes
and
her
cheek
be
fair
to
all
men
except
the
king
of
aragon
and
may
i
come
speedily
to
beziers
whither
my
desire
and
my
dream
have
preceded
me
o
hole
in
the
wall
here
be
thou
my
jongleur
as
had
i
other
and
when
the
wind
blows
sing
thou
the
grace
of
the
lady
of
beziers
for
even
as
thou
art
hollow
before
i
fill
thee
with
this
parchment
so
is
my
heart
hollow
when
she
filleth
not
mine
eyes
and
so
were
my
mind
hollow
did
she
not
fill
utterly
my
thought
wherefore
o
hole
in
the
wall
here
when
the
wind
blows
sigh
thou
for
my
sorrow
that
i
have
not
the
countess
of
beziers
close
in
my
arms
here
even
as
thou
shalt
soon
have
this
parchment
o
hole
in
the
wall
here
be
thou
my
jongleur
and
though
thou
sighest
my
sorrow
in
the
wind
keep
yet
my
secret
in
thy
breast
here
even
as
i
keep
her
image
in
my
heart
here
pergamena
revolt
against
the
crepuscular
spirit
in
modern
poetry
i
would
shake
off
the
lethargy
of
this
our
time
and
give
for
shadows
shapes
of
power
for
dreams
men
it
is
better
to
dream
than
do
aye
and
no
aye
if
we
dream
great
deeds
strong
men
hearts
hot
thoughts
mighty
no
if
we
dream
pale
flowers
pageantry
of
hours
that
languidly
drop
as
fruit
from
sallow
trees
if
so
we
live
and
die
not
life
but
dreams
great
god
grant
life
in
dreams
not
dalliance
but
life
let
us
be
men
that
dream
not
cowards
dabblers
waiters
for
dead
time
to
reawaken
and
grant
balm
for
ills
unnamed
great
god
if
we
be
damn
to
be
not
men
but
only
dreams
then
let
us
be
such
dreams
the
world
shall
tremble
at
and
know
we
be
its
rulers
though
but
dreams
then
let
us
be
such
shadows
as
the
world
shall
tremble
at
and
know
we
be
its
masters
though
but
shadow
great
god
if
men
are
grown
but
pale
sick
phantoms
that
must
live
only
in
these
mists
and
tempered
lights
and
tremble
for
dim
hours
that
knock
loud
or
tread
too
violent
in
passing
them
great
god
if
these
thy
sons
are
grown
such
thin
ephemera
i
bid
thee
grapple
chaos
and
beget
some
new
titanic
spawn
to
pile
the
hills
and
stir
this
earth
again
and
thus
in
nineveh
aye
i
am
a
poet
and
upon
my
tomb
shall
maidens
scatter
rose
leaves
and
men
myrtles
ere
the
night
slays
day
with
her
dark
sword
lo
this
thing
is
not
mine
nor
thine
to
hinder
for
the
custom
is
full
old
and
here
in
nineveh
have
i
beheld
many
a
singer
pass
and
take
his
place
in
those
dim
halls
where
no
man
troubleth
his
sleep
or
song
and
many
a
one
hath
sung
his
songs
more
craftily
more
than
i
and
many
a
one
now
doth
surpass
my
beauty
with
his
wind
of
flowers
yet
am
i
poet
and
upon
my
tomb
shall
all
men
scatter
rose
leaves
ere
the
night
slay
light
with
her
blue
sword
it
is
not
raama
that
my
song
rings
highest
or
more
sweet
in
tone
than
any
but
that
i
am
here
a
poet
that
doth
drink
of
life
as
lesser
men
drink
wine
the
white
stag
