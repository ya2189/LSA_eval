note
if
the
mental
attitude
of
any
critic
has
ever
in
his
approach
to
a
first
book
of
verse
been
conciliated
by
an
appreciative
notice
from
some
older
pen
i
should
say
speaking
out
of
no
little
experience
that
either
the
author
was
dead
and
the
fact
advertised
in
the
preface
or
alternatively
that
the
critic
was
possessed
by
a
gentler
spirit
than
mine
i
am
sure
at
any
rate
that
artistic
work
great
or
small
should
be
sternly
judged
on
what
it
is
rather
than
on
what
it
promises
the
late
comyns
carr
in
the
days
when
he
wrote
dramatic
criticism
let
loose
this
restive
truth
in
a
couple
of
short
sentences
are
told
that
is
a
promising
young
actor
personally
i
do
care
how
much
he
promises
so
long
as
he
never
again
performs
let
me
then
pass
over
mr
gerald
bullett
verses
with
the
simple
remark
that
i
believe
in
them
he
himself
calls
them
no
overweening
title
however
boldly
printed
yet
mice
were
dear
to
apollo
smintheus
and
his
proper
emblem
and
let
me
come
to
the
general
purpose
of
this
note
it
is
meant
to
preface
a
series
of
small
volumes
of
verse
by
young
writers
mostly
cambridge
men
that
since
the
war
young
men
in
extraordinary
numbers
have
taken
to
expressing
themselves
in
verse
is
a
plain
fact
not
to
be
denied
that
they
choose
as
often
as
not
to
express
themselves
in
extraordinary
to
us
can
as
hardly
be
contested
but
the
point
is
they
have
a
crowding
impulse
to
say
something
and
to
say
it
with
the
emotional
seriousness
proper
to
poetry
for
my
part
i
love
the
discipline
of
verse
but
i
love
the
impulse
better
time
will
soften
i
hope
not
too
soon
lest
it
sugar
down
and
sentimentalise
a
certain
bitterness
of
resentment
observable
in
this
booklet
and
its
next
followers
but
as
nothing
in
verse
is
nobler
than
true
tradition
anything
is
more
hopeful
than
convention
so
these
booklets
have
been
planned
to
give
youth
its
chance
to
make
spoons
or
spoil
horns
if
anyone
object
that
the
print
and
page
the
content
of
any
one
volume
in
the
proposed
series
why
that
must
be
a
particular
criticism
which
can
not
honestly
i
think
be
enlarged
to
blame
the
publisher
wish
and
the
care
he
has
taken
that
what
pretends
however
modestly
to
be
a
work
of
the
muse
should
step
forth
to
the
public
in

thirsty
land
your

beauty

fountain

of

here
is
oblivion

and

where
my

shall
sing
your

that
light

and
your
lips
that
bless
strength
the
mellow
music
and
the
the
steadfast
beauty
of
her
eyes
is
balm
and
in
her
touch
there
healing
for
my
hurt
she
is
unshaken
as
a
vessel
girt
mid
waters
of
unutterable
calm
the
years
grow
fragrant
with
her
fragrance
they
sipping
her
sweetness
leave
her
yet
more
sweet
laden
with
divers
colours
at
her
feet
they
shed
their
motley
silks
and
go
their
way
like
withered
dreams
so
youth
must
follow
after
youth
that
is
brief
and
beauty
that
is
grass
but
from
her
gentle
soul
shall
never
pass
the
strength
the
mellow
music
and
the
laughter
ashes
bury
the
ashes
the
life
the
gleam
of
love
is
gone
we
have
killed
with
kisses
the
fragile
soul
of
rapture
this
is
only
the
hollow
husk
of
a
dream
the
bitter
waking
the
end
thereof
come
bury
the
ashes
of
love
the
music
falters
the
flame
is
spent
the
vision
is
gone
the
splendour
faded
leaving
only
a
pitiful
jaded
and
a
discontent
the
end
of
love
is
a
weary
kiss
surely
hate
were
better
than
this
bist

so
like
a
flower
so
gentle
so
fair
so
pure
thou
art
that
musing
on
thy
beauty
brings
sadness
to
my
heart
i
lay
my
hands
in
spirit
upon
thy
gleaming
hair
praying
that
god
may
keep
thee
so
sweet
so
pure
so
fair
the
german
of
home
five
weary
days
and
i
shall
creep
into
the
shadow
of
her
hair
and
of
her
loveliness
drink
deep
and
lose
my
desolation
there
feeling
her
cool
lips
quench
my
own
lying
so
still
we
shall
not
dare
to
let
one
murmur
like
a
stone
into
the
pool
of
silence
fall
all
senses
will
be
fused
in
one
peace
will
surround
us
with
a
wall
of
visible
music
moments
go
melodiously
by
and
all
the
stillness
brim
with
beauty
so
our
hearts
will
whisper
throbbing
fast
time
undeviating
flow
and
bear
this
fragile
moment
past
de
on
a
gossamer
thread
of
light
that
stretches
from
dark
to
dark
over
the
void
we
giddily
jig
to
the
mad
music
the
master
makes
from
the
green
room
he
calls
us
forth
sensitive
puppets
live
automata
and
with
a
gesture
sets
us
jerkily
dancing
the
tightrope
from
a
seat
in
the
stalls
of
the
cosmic
theatre
silently
he
watches
our
antics
when
we
call
to
him
master
help
we
are
falling
out
of
the
darkness
comes
no
word
a
chuckle
the
grudge
grudged
not
those
that
were
dearer
than
all
we
possessed
lovers
brothers
sons
our
hearts
were
full
and
out
of
a
full
heart
we
gave
our
beloved
laurence
binyon
we
are
of
baser
quality
we
have
been
tried
by
fire
and
judged
a
spurious
gold
we
are
little
of
soul
and
yet
in
our
pigmy
way
we
have
suffered
and
loved
with
a
love
that
can
not
be
told
being
less
than
you
we
did
not
eagerly
quaff
the
cup
of
gall
we
prayed
that
it
might
pass
we
are
not
gods
we
are
pitiful
human
stuff
and
the
blood
of
our
passion
has
stained
gethsemane
grass
we
were
not
blind
to
the
vision
we
heard
the
call
and
followed
or
watched
our
belov√®d
steadfastly
go
but
our
grief
is
naked
and
shivers
and
will
not
be
soothed
by
splendid
phrases
or
clothed
in
a
moral
glow
we
can
not
say
for
our
comfort
them
we
gain
a
glimpse
of
noble
terrible
heights
a
cleansing
exquisite
pain
a
sacred
grief
a
dream
to
cherish
we
think
of
the
vanished
lights
we
think
of
the
fine
nerves
shattered
the
warm
blood
chilled
the
laughter
silenced
the
zest
and
the
beauty
gone
the
desolation
of
wasted
wonderful
dreams
that
will
never
be
lived
of
work
that
can
not
be
done
wedding
day
was
it
for
this
we
loved
to
settle
down
having
once
paid
the
necessary
fee
in
some
nice
suburb
not
too
far
from
town
to
eat
and
sleep
and
kiss
complacently
loving
by
rote
as
decent
people
do
was
it
for
this
we
hungered
i
and
you
a
lover
vows
are
gossamer
they
say
but
we
have
registered
our
mutual
vow
for
seven
and
sixpence
dearest
yesterday
there
was
but
love
to
bind
our
hearts
but
now
we
owe
it
to
the
vicar
to
be
good
and
love
each
other
as
we
said
we
would
that
promise
at
the
altar
is
a
link
which
only
death
can
break
between
us
two
for
every
time
i
kiss
you
i
shall
think
this
would
please
the
vicar
if
he
knew
and
we
shall
put
our
youthful
dreams
to
bed
and
so
live
on
long
after
we
are
dead
we
are
made
one
one
mind
will
serve
us
both
yes
we
think
locke
novels
rather
sweet
in
witness
of
our
troth
you
serve
the
vegetables
i
the
meat
o
happiness
it
is
our
wedding
day
embrace
me
dear
the
prayer

you
may
crucifixion
we
wage
eternal
war
on
the
losing
side
ever
defeated
we
by
the
sinister
foe
that
only
pathetic
piety
seeks
to
hide
in
a
theological
costume
of
long
ago
the
goal
we
seek
to
attain
will
never
be
ours
all
our
hopes
will
end
in
ashes
and
dust
all
our
dreams
will
be
dead
desolate
flowers
plucked
by
the
pitiless
hand
we
were
taught
to
trust
doomed
to
eternal
defeat
in
the
endless
strife
scornful
of
chance
the
almighty
we
worship
with
pride
the
divine
frail
terrible
beauty
of
life
on
the
cross
of
fate
incessantly
crucified
spring
in
winter
my
memories
of
you
are
singing
birds
in
the
green
forest
of
my
mind
where
i
may
roam
recapturing
your
whispered
words
or
on
a
bank
of
glowing
bluebells
lie
listening
for
ever
spring
is
come
again
in
all
her
glory
the
erst
withered
trees
that
creaked
like
living
skeletons
in
pain
defying
the
wind
have
donned
green
garments
these
new
shoots
these
blossoms
and
these
buds
the
springing
grass
and
the
sky
where
many
colours
blend
my
songsters
by
the
magic
of
their
singing
have
in
a
moment
made
my
thoughts
of
you
are
music
which
to
all
my
spirit
rue
is
the
ineffable
answer
and
the
end
the
exile
now
i
return
to
my
own
land
and
people
old
familiar
things
so
to
recover
hedgerows
and
little
lanes
and
meadows
the
friendliness
of
my
own
land
and
people
i
have
seen
a
of
glowing
orange
palms
painted
black
on
the
satin
horizon
in
the
dusk
and
the
silence
standing
straight
and
still
against
a
background
of
orange
a
gorgeous
magical
pomp
of
light
and
colour
a
a
sparkling
gem
in
the
sunlight
the
minarets
and
domes
of
an
eastern
city
and
in
the
midst
of
all
the
pomp
of
colour
my
heart
cried
out
for
my
own
land
and
people
my
heart
cried
out
for
the
lush
meadows
of
england
the
hedgerows
and
little
lanes
of
england
and
for
the
faces
of
my
own
people
sonnet
for
helen
when
you
very
old
when
in
the
candlelight
your
hair
silver
shews
when
by
the
fire
you
spinning
sit
and
weaving
you
will
croon
my
verses
but
in
wonder
scarce
believing
hymned
my
beauty
in
the
days
when
i
was
fair
never
servant
could
you
have
tho
she
were
but
would
rouse
herself
to
listen
to
your
lyric
grieving
wake
to
hear
my
name
and
your
glory
my
achieving
my
immortal
praise
of
your
beauty
past
compare
i
shall
be
beneath
the
earth
an
unsubstantial
shade
where
the
myrtles
throw
their
shadow
will
my
bones
be
laid
you
will
be
a
squatting
crony
sighing
by
the
fire
sighing
for
the
love
you
scorned
recalling
it
with
sorrow
live
o
live
and
love
delay
not
till
the
morrow
gather
now
the
roses
of
youth
and
desire
the
french
of
song
how
did
we
dim
that
wistful
dream
that
shy
first
love
without
caress
that
breathless
wonder
that
supreme
vision
of
all
love
loveliness
for
surely
had
we
parted
then
kissed
once
with
tears
and
said
we
had
been
speaking
truly
when
we
said
our
love
could
never
die
because
we
did
a
moment
cling
with
trembling
senses
cling
and
kiss
does
it
not
seem
a
bitter
thing
that
bliss
should
die
of
too
much
bliss
love
is
a
fair
and
fragile
flower
which
youth
must
needs
poor
foolish
boy
pluck
greedily
the
hour
he
weeps
to
see
his
withered
joy
musings
be
calmer
o
my
grief
be
quieter
the
dusk
you
craved
enfolds
us
everywhere
the
twilight
veil
of
gossamer
falls
bringing
peace
to
some
to
others
care
while
thralls
of
pleasure
that
most
merciless
of
tyrants
hasten
to
his
board
although
his
wine
is
gall
and
his
fruit
bitterness
come
with
me
o
my
grief
and
let
us
go
far
from
them
see
the
bygone
years
that
throng
heaven
balconies
see
smiling
sorrow
strong
in
fortitude
rise
from
the
waters
see
the
dying
sun
low
sinking
disappear
beyond
the
verge
the
rustling
mystery
of
night
approaches
hear
beloved
hear
the
french
of
the
poet
where
the
flowers
are
most
tall
heedless
of
his
mother
call
wooden
sword
in
his
hand
tightly
clasped
i
see
him
stand
he
is
pondering
with
eyes
full
of
surmise
two
great
hollyhocks
that
sway
this
way
that
way
till
they
almost
touch
his
cheek
queer
solemn
souls
they
seem
lost
in
dream
always
just
about
to
speak
then
he
with
thirsty
eyes
drinks
the
intoxicating
skies
done
with
earth
he
bestrides
the
galloping
white
horses
rides
the
blue
valleys
and
the
red
hills
of
sunset
and
his
pocket
fills
with
golden
apples
days
pass
long
full
days
the
grass
suddenly
stirs
and
he
plunges
into
the
perilous
wood
and
lunges
stoutly
at
the
dragon
head
till
the
fiery
beast
is
dead
now
that
dusk
is
fast
falling
he
obey
his
mother
calling
out
of
fairyland
with
slow
thoughtful
steps
he
turns
to
go
yet
there
just
time
to
float
in
the
his
boat
made
of
cork
and
spent
matches
so
at
the
last
he
snatches
great
adventure
from
the
dread
unrelenting
jaws
of
bed
round
the
magic
world
rides
he
and
lives
a
breathless
odyssey
all
the
trees
were
magic
if
all
the
trees
were
magic
trees
and
talked
among
themselves
if
kings
could
sleep
in
daffodils
and
bishops
danced
on
if
all
the
valleys
changed
to
hills
and
all
the
tens
to
twelves
the
world
would
be
nonsensical
and
we
should
all
be
elves
if
every
street
in
camden
town
were
paved
with
precious
stones
if
modest
souls
began
to
drape
their
in
decent
crape
if
every
squirrel
wore
a
cape
and
had
the
name
of
jones
i
weave
a
robe
of
beetles
eyes
and
jellyfishes
bones
if
kingcups
blossomed
in
the
sky
and
fell
like
golden
rain
in
grey
shot
through
and
through
with
shafts
of
green
and
shafts
of
blue
if
pink
and
purple
chickweed
grew
on
every
window
pane
all
truly
tidy
folk
would
deem
the
universe
insane
if
we
were
sensible
enough
to
hear
the
bluebells
ring
were
sight
so
true
and
hearts
so
wise
that
we
could
see
with
glowing
eyes
enchantment
flaming
from
the
skies
and
joy
in
everything
then
every
girl
a
queen
would
be
and
every
boy
a
king
with
these
my
poems
alone
with
these
my
poems
when
night
is
still
earth
seems
but
a
speck
of
fluttering
dust
in
a
waste
of
eternity
alone
with
these
symbols
of
human
thought
all
our
measureless
system
of
whirling
worlds
seems
itself
a
symbol
a
chance
phrase
in
a
poem
wrought
by
the
hand
of
a
brooding
god
where
we
ourselves
are
less
than
commas
and
dots
and
had
he
smeared
out
with
careless
thumb
all
life
from
its
first
birth
in
the
waters
to
the
ultimate
dissolution
of
stars
and
suns
he
had
made
no
more
than
an
caesura
alone
with
these
my
poems
when
night
is
still
i
am
less
than
a
speck
of
dust
on
the
wing
of
a
moth
fluttering
in
a
waste
of
eternity
