a
heap
o
by
edgar
a
guest
to
marjorie
and
buddy
this
little
book
of
verse
is
affectionately
dedicated
by
their
daddy
when
you
know
a
fellow
when
you
get
to
know
a
fellow
know
his
joys
and
know
his
cares
when
you
come
to
understand
him
and
the
burdens
that
he
bears
when
you
learned
the
fight
he
making
and
the
troubles
in
his
way
then
you
find
that
he
is
different
than
you
thought
him
yesterday
you
find
his
faults
are
trivial
and
there
not
so
much
to
blame
in
the
brother
that
you
jeered
at
when
you
only
knew
his
name
you
are
quick
to
see
the
blemish
in
the
distant
neighbor
style
you
can
point
to
all
his
errors
and
may
sneer
at
him
the
while
and
your
prejudices
fatten
and
your
hates
more
violent
grow
as
you
talk
about
the
failures
of
the
man
you
do
not
know
but
when
drawn
a
little
closer
and
your
hands
and
shoulders
touch
you
find
the
traits
you
hated
really
amount
to
much
when
you
get
to
know
a
fellow
know
his
every
mood
and
whim
you
begin
to
find
the
texture
of
the
splendid
side
of
him
you
begin
to
understand
him
and
you
cease
to
scoff
and
sneer
for
with
understanding
always
prejudices
disappear
you
begin
to
find
his
virtues
and
his
faults
you
cease
to
tell
for
you
seldom
hate
a
fellow
when
you
know
him
very
well
when
next
you
start
in
sneering
and
your
phrases
turn
to
blame
know
more
of
him
you
censure
than
his
business
and
his
name
for
it
likely
that
acquaintance
would
your
prejudice
dispel
and
you
really
come
to
like
him
if
you
knew
him
very
well
when
you
get
to
know
a
fellow
and
you
understand
his
ways
then
his
faults
wo
really
matter
for
find
a
lot
to
praise
the
rough
little
rascal
a
smudge
on
his
nose
and
a
smear
on
his
cheek
and
knees
that
might
not
have
been
washed
in
a
week
a
bump
on
his
forehead
a
scar
on
his
lip
a
relic
of
many
a
tumble
and
trip
a
rough
little
tough
little
rascal
but
sweet
is
he
that
each
evening
i
eager
to
meet
a
brow
that
is
beady
with
jewels
of
sweat
a
face
that
as
black
as
a
visage
can
get
a
suit
that
at
noon
was
a
garment
of
white
now
one
that
his
mother
declares
is
a
fright
a
rascal
and
fine
is
he
that
comes
placing
his
black
fist
in
mine
a
crop
of
brown
hair
that
is
tousled
and
tossed
a
waist
from
which
two
of
the
buttons
are
lost
a
smile
that
shines
out
through
the
dirt
and
the
grime
and
eyes
that
are
flashing
delight
all
the
time
all
these
are
the
joys
that
i
eager
to
meet
and
look
for
the
moment
i
get
to
my
street
it
is
costly
does
the
grouch
get
richer
quicker
than
the
friendly
sort
of
man
can
the
grumbler
labor
better
than
the
cheerful
fellow
can
is
the
mean
and
churlish
neighbor
any
cleverer
than
the
one
who
shouts
a
glad
good
morning
and
then
smiling
passes
on
just
stop
and
think
about
it
have
you
ever
known
or
seen
a
mean
man
who
succeeded
just
because
he
was
so
mean
when
you
find
a
grouch
with
honors
and
with
money
in
his
pouch
you
can
bet
he
did
win
them
just
because
he
was
a
grouch
oh
you
not
be
any
poorer
if
you
smile
along
your
way
and
your
lot
will
not
be
harder
for
the
kindly
things
you
say
do
imagine
you
are
wasting
time
for
others
that
you
spend
you
can
rise
to
wealth
and
glory
and
still
pause
to
be
a
friend
my
creed
to
live
as
gently
as
i
can
to
be
no
matter
where
a
man
to
take
what
comes
of
good
or
ill
and
cling
to
faith
and
honor
still
to
do
my
best
and
let
that
stand
the
record
of
my
brain
and
hand
and
then
should
failure
come
to
me
still
work
and
hope
for
victory
to
have
no
secret
place
wherein
i
stoop
unseen
to
shame
or
sin
to
be
the
same
when
i
alone
as
when
my
every
deed
is
known
to
live
undaunted
unafraid
of
any
step
that
i
have
made
to
be
without
pretense
or
sham
exactly
what
men
think
i
am
to
leave
some
simple
mark
behind
to
keep
my
having
lived
in
mind
if
enmity
to
aught
i
show
to
be
an
honest
generous
foe
to
play
my
little
part
nor
whine
that
greater
honors
are
not
mine
this
i
believe
is
all
i
need
for
my
philosophy
and
creed
a
wish
i
like
to
be
a
boy
again
a
prince
of
joy
again
i
like
to
tread
the
hills
and
dales
the
way
i
used
to
do
i
like
the
tattered
shirt
again
the
knickers
thick
with
dirt
again
the
ugly
dusty
feet
again
that
long
ago
i
knew
i
like
to
play
first
base
again
and
curves
to
face
again
i
like
to
climb
the
way
i
did
a
friendly
apple
tree
for
knowing
what
i
do
could
i
but
wander
back
and
play
i
get
full
measure
of
the
joy
that
boyhood
gave
to
me
i
like
to
be
a
lad
again
a
youngster
wild
and
glad
again
i
like
to
sleep
and
eat
again
the
way
i
used
to
do
i
like
to
race
and
run
again
and
drain
from
life
its
fun
again
and
start
another
round
of
joy
the
moment
one
was
through
but
care
and
strife
have
come
to
me
and
often
days
are
glum
to
me
and
sleep
is
not
the
thing
it
was
and
food
is
not
the
same
and
i
have
sighed
and
known
that
i
must
journey
on
again
to
sigh
and
i
have
stood
at
envy
point
and
heard
the
voice
of
shame
i
learned
that
joys
are
fleeting
things
that
parting
pain
each
meeting
brings
that
gain
and
loss
are
partners
here
and
so
are
smiles
and
tears
that
only
boys
from
day
to
day
can
drain
and
fill
the
cup
of
play
that
age
must
mourn
for
what
is
lost
throughout
the
coming
years
but
boys
can
not
appreciate
their
priceless
joy
until
too
late
and
those
who
own
the
charms
i
had
will
soon
be
changed
to
men
and
then
they
too
will
sit
as
i
and
backward
turn
to
look
and
sigh
and
share
my
longing
vain
to
be
a
boy
again
what
a
baby
costs
how
much
do
babies
cost
said
he
the
other
night
upon
my
knee
and
then
i
said
they
cost
a
lot
a
lot
of
watching
by
a
cot
a
lot
of
sleepless
hours
and
care
a
lot
of
and
despair
a
lot
of
fear
and
trying
dread
and
sometimes
many
tears
are
shed
in
payment
for
our
babies
small
but
every
one
is
worth
it
all
for
babies
people
have
to
pay
a
heavy
price
from
day
to
day
there
is
no
way
to
get
one
cheap
why
sometimes
when
they
fast
asleep
you
have
to
get
up
in
the
night
and
go
and
see
that
they
all
right
but
what
they
cost
in
constant
care
and
worry
does
not
half
compare
with
what
they
bring
of
joy
and
bliss
you
pay
much
more
for
just
a
kiss
who
buys
a
baby
has
to
pay
a
portion
of
the
bill
each
day
he
has
to
give
his
time
and
thought
unto
the
little
one
he
bought
he
has
to
stand
a
lot
of
pain
inside
his
heart
and
not
complain
and
pay
with
lonely
days
and
sad
for
all
the
happy
hours
he
had
all
this
a
baby
costs
and
yet
his
smile
is
worth
it
all
you
bet
mother
never
a
sigh
for
the
cares
that
she
bore
for
me
never
a
thought
of
the
joys
that
flew
by
her
one
regret
that
she
could
do
more
for
me
thoughtless
and
selfish
her
master
was
oh
the
long
nights
that
she
came
at
my
call
to
me
oh
the
soft
touch
of
her
hands
on
my
brow
oh
the
long
years
that
she
gave
up
her
all
to
me
oh
how
i
yearn
for
her
gentleness
now
slave
to
her
baby
yes
that
was
the
way
of
her
counting
her
greatest
of
services
small
words
can
not
tell
what
this
old
heart
would
say
of
her
mother
the
sweetest
and
fairest
of
all

am
selfish

my
wishin

rich
who
has
a
troop
of
romping
youth
about
his
parlor
floor
who
nightly
hears
a
round
of
cheers
when
he
is
at
the
door
who
is
attacked
on
every
side
by
eager
little
hands
that
reach
to
tug

grizzled
mug

knows

lads
and
lassies

pounced
upon
and
bounced
upon
when
his

gentle
tug
of
some
glad

oh
be

sore
distressed
and
weary
with
the
fight
if
with
a
whoop
his
healthy
troop
run
welcoming
at
night
and
kisses
greet
him
at
the
end

all
his

envy
him
ma
and
the
auto
before
we
take
an
auto
ride
pa
says
to
ma
my
dear
now
just
remember
i
do
need
suggestions
from
the
rear
if
you
will
just
sit
still
back
there
and
hold
in
check
your
fright
i
take
you
where
you
want
to
go
and
get
you
back
all
right
remember
that
my
hearing
good
and
also
not
blind
and
i
can
drive
this
car
without
suggestions
from
behind
ma
promises
that
she
keep
still
then
off
we
gayly
start
but
soon
she
notices
ahead
a
peddler
and
his
cart
you
better
toot
your
horn
says
she
to
let
him
know
we
near
he
might
turn
out
and
pa
replies
just
shriek
at
him
my
dear
and
then
he
adds
some
day
some
guy
will
make
a
lot
of
dough
by
putting
horns
on
tonneau
seats
for
to
blow
a
little
farther
on
ma
cries
he
signaled
for
a
turn
and
pa
says
did
he
in
a
tone
that
hot
enough
to
burn
oh
there
a
boy
on
roller
skates
cries
ma
now
do
go
slow
i
sure
he
does
see
our
car
and
pa
says
i
dunno
i
think
i
do
need
glasses
yet
but
really
it
may
be
that
i
am
blind
and
can
not
see
what
right
in
front
of
me
if
pa
should
speed
the
car
a
bit
some
rigs
to
hurry
past
ma
whispers
do
be
careful
now
driving
much
too
fast
and
all
the
time
she
pointing
out
the
dangers
of
the
street
and
keeps
him
posted
on
the
roads
where
trolley
cars
he
meet
last
night
when
we
got
safely
home
pa
sighed
and
said
my
dear
i
sure
we
all
enjoyed
the
drive
you
gave
us
from
the
rear
on
going
home
for
christmas
he
little
knew
the
sorrow
that
was
in
his
vacant
chair
he
never
guessed
they
miss
him
or
surely
have
been
there
he
could
see
his
mother
or
the
lump
that
filled
her
throat
or
the
tears
that
started
falling
as
she
read
his
hasty
note
and
he
could
see
his
father
sitting
sorrowful
and
dumb
or
he
never
would
have
written
that
he
thought
he
could
come
he
little
knew
the
gladness
that
his
presence
would
have
made
and
the
joy
it
would
have
given
or
he
never
would
have
stayed
he
did
know
how
hungry
had
the
little
mother
grown
once
again
to
see
her
baby
and
to
claim
him
for
her
own
he
did
guess
the
meaning
of
his
visit
christmas
day
or
he
never
would
have
written
that
he
could
get
away
he
could
see
the
fading
of
the
cheeks
that
once
were
pink
and
the
silver
in
the
tresses
and
he
stop
to
think
how
the
years
are
passing
swiftly
and
next
christmas
it
might
be
there
would
be
no
home
to
visit
and
no
mother
dear
to
see
he
did
think
about
it
i
not
say
he
care
he
was
heedless
and
forgetful
or
he
surely
have
been
there
are
you
going
home
for
christmas
have
you
written
you
be
there
going
home
to
kiss
the
mother
and
to
show
her
that
you
care
going
home
to
greet
the
father
in
a
way
to
make
him
glad
if
you
not
i
hope
there
never
come
a
time
you
wish
you
had
just
sit
down
and
write
a
letter
it
will
make
their
heart
strings
hum
with
a
tune
of
perfect
gladness
if
you
tell
them
that
you
come
at
sugar
camp
at
sugar
camp
the
cook
is
kind
and
laughs
the
laugh
we
knew
as
boys
and
there
we
slip
away
and
find
awaiting
us
the
joys
the
catbird
calls
the
selfsame
way
she
used
to
in
the
long
ago
and
there
a
chorus
all
the
day
of
songsters
it
is
good
to
know
the
killdeer
in
the
distance
cries
the
thrasher
in
her
garb
of
brown
from
tree
to
tree
in
gladness
flies
forgotten
is
the
world
renown
forgotten
are
the
years
we
known
at
sugar
camp
there
are
no
men
we
ceased
to
strive
for
things
to
own
we
in
the
woods
as
boys
again
our
pride
is
in
the
strength
of
trees
our
pomp
the
pomp
of
living
things
our
ears
are
tuned
to
melodies
that
every
feathered
songster
sings
at
sugar
camp
our
noonday
meal
is
eaten
in
the
open
air
where
through
the
leaves
the
sunbeams
steal
and
simple
is
our
bill
of
fare
at
sugar
camp
in
peace
we
dwell
and
none
is
boastful
of
himself
none
plots
to
gain
with
shot
and
shell
his
neighbor
bit
of
land
or
pelf
the
roar
of
cannon
is
heard
there
stilled
is
money
tempting
voice
someone
detects
a
bird
and
at
her
presence
all
rejoice
at
sugar
camp
the
cook
is
kind
his
steak
is
broiling
the
coals
and
in
its
sputtering
we
find
sweet
harmony
for
tired
souls
there
sheltered
by
the
friendly
trees
as
boys
we
sit
to
eat
our
meal
and
brothers
to
the
birds
and
bees
we
hold
communion
with
the
real
home
it
takes
a
heap
o
livin
in
a
house
t
make
it
home
a
heap
o
sun
an
shadder
an
ye
sometimes
have
t
roam
afore

really
the
things

how
great
yer
luxury

ai

the
palace
of

king
until

soul
is

a
place

t

the
way
they

so
they
would

the
early
mornin

ye

t
love
each
brick
an
stone
from
cellar
up
t
dome
it
takes
a
heap
o
livin
in
a
house
t
make
it
home
the
path
that
leads
to
home
the
little
path
that
leads
to
home
that
is
the
road
for
me
i
know
no
finer
path
to
roam
with
finer
sights
to
see
with
thoroughfares
the
world
is
lined
that
lead
to
wonders
new
but
he
who
treads
them
leaves
behind
the
tender
things
and
true
oh
north
and
south
and
east
and
west
the
crowded
roadways
go
and
sweating
brow
and
weary
breast
are
all
they
seem
to
know
and
mad
for
pleasure
some
are
bent
and
some
are
seeking
fame
and
some
are
sick
with
discontent
and
some
are
bruised
and
lame
across
the
world
the
gleaming
steel
holds
out
its
lure
for
men
but
no
one
finds
his
comfort
real
till
he
comes
home
again
and
charted
lanes
now
line
the
sea
for
weary
hearts
to
roam
but
oh
the
finest
path
to
me
is
that
which
leads
to
home
is
there
i
come
to
laughing
eyes
and
find
a
welcome
true
is
there
all
care
behind
me
lies
and
joy
is
ever
new
and
oh
when
every
day
is
done
upon
that
little
street
a
pair
of
rosy
youngsters
run
to
me
with
flying
feet
the
world
with
myriad
paths
is
lined
but
one
alone
for
me
one
little
road
where
i
may
find
the
charms
i
want
to
see
though
thoroughfares
majestic
call
the
multitude
to
roam
i
would
not
leave
to
know
them
all
the
path
that
leads
to
home
a
friend
greeting
i
like
to
be
the
sort
of
friend
that
you
have
been
to
me

like
to
be
the
help
that
you
been
always
glad
to
be
i
like
to
mean
as
much
to
you
each
minute
of
the
day
as
you
have
meant
old
friend
of
mine
to
me
along
the
way
i
like
to
do
the
big
things
and
the
splendid
things
for
you
to
brush
the
gray
from
out
your
skies
and
leave
them
only
blue
i
like
to
say
the
kindly
things
that
i
so
oft
have
heard
and
feel
that
i
could
rouse
your
soul
the
way
that
mine
you
stirred
i
like
to
give
you
back
the
joy
that
you
have
given
me
yet
that
were
wishing
you
a
need
i
hope
will
never
be
i
like
to
make
you
feel
as
rich
as
i
who
travel
on
undaunted
in
the
darkest
hours
with
you
to
lean
upon
i
wishing
at
this
christmas
time
that
i
could
but
repay
a
portion
of
the
gladness
that
you
strewn
along
my
way
and
could
i
have
one
wish
this
year
this
only
would
it
be
i
like
to
be
the
sort
of
friend
that
you
have
been
to
me
a
song
none
knows
the
day
that
friends
must
part
none
knows
how
near
is
sorrow
if
there
be
laughter
in
your
heart
do
hold
it
for
smile
all
the
smiles

can
grief

for
all
along
the
way
is
ours
for
joy
and
mirth
we
may
be
sad
then

us
sing
for
all
we
worth
nor
give
a
thought
to
sorrow

knows
what
lies
along
the
way
let
smile
what
smiles
we
can
old
friends
i
do
not
say
new
friends
are
not
considerate
and
true
or
that
their
smiles
ai
genuine
but
still
tellin
you
that
when
a
feller
heart
is
crushed
and
with
the
pain
and
teardrops
come
down
his
cheeks
like
summer
rain
becoz
his
grief
an
loneliness
are
more
than
he
can
bear
somehow
it
only
old
friends
then
that
really
seem
to
care
the
friends
who
stuck
through
thick
thin
who
known
you
good
an
bad
your
faults
an
virtues
an
have
seen
the
struggles
you
have
had
when
they
come
to
you
an
take
your
hand
an
say
cheer
up
we
with
you
still
it
counts
for
that
the
old
friends
way
the
new
friends
may
be
fond
of
you
for
what
you
are
they
only
known
you
rich
perhaps
an
only
seen
you
gay
you
ca
tell
what
attracted
them
your
station
may
appeal
perhaps
they
smile
on
you
because
you
something
real
but
old
friends
who
have
seen
you
fail
an
also
seen
you
win
who
loved
you
either
up
or
down
stuck
to
you
thick
or
thin
who
knew
you
as
a
budding
youth
an
watched
you
start
to
climb
through
weal
an
woe
still
friends
of
yours
an
constant
all
the
time
when
trouble
comes
an
things
go
wrong
i
do
care
what
you
say
they
are
the
friends
you
turn
to
for
you
want
the
old
friends
way
the
new
friends
may
be
richer
an
more
stylish
too
but
when
your
heart
is
achin
an
you
think
your
sun
wo
shine
again
it
not
the
riches
of
new
friends
you
want
not
their
style
it
not
the
airs
of
grandeur
then
it
just
the
old
friend
smile
the
old
hand
that
has
helped
before
stretched
out
once
more
to
you
the
old
words
ringin
in
your
ears
so
sweet
an
oh
so
true
the
tenderness
of
folks
who
know
just
what
your
sorrow
means
these
are
the
things
on
which
somehow
your
spirit
always
leans
when
grief
is
poundin
at
your
breast
the
new
friends
disappear
an
to
the
old
ones
tried
an
true
you
turn
for
aid
an
cheer
folks
we
was
speakin
of
folks
jes
common
folks
an
we
come
to
this
conclusion
that
wherever
they
be
on
land
or
sea
they
warm
to
a
home
allusion
that
under
the
skin
an
under
the
hide
there
a
spark
that
starts
whenever
they
look
at
a
scene
or
book
that
something
of
home
is
showin
they
may
differ
in
creeds
an
politics
they
may
argue
an
even
quarrel
but
their
throats
grip
tight
if
they
catch
a
sight
of
their
favorite
elm
or
laurel
an
the
winding
lane
that
they
used
to
tread
with
never
a
care
to
fret
or
the
pasture
gate
where
they
used
to
wait
right
under
the
skin
will
get
now
folks
is
folks
on
their
different
ways
with
their
different
griefs
an
pleasures
but
the
home
they
knew
when
their
years
were
few
is
the
dearest
of
all
their
treasures
an
the
richest
man
to
the
poorest
waif
right
under
the
skin
is
brother
when
they
stand
an
sigh
with
a
eye
at
a
thought
of
the
dear
old
mother
it
makes
no
difference
where
it
may
be
nor
the
fortunes
that
years
may
alter
be
they
simple
or
wise
the
old

all
of
often

robe
in

whatever
their

down
deep
that
is
sweet
an
tender
we
was
speakin
of
folks
jes
common

an
we
come
to
this
conclusion
that
one

allusion
that
under

your
roguish
way
time
i
know
will
stop
you
soon
enough
some
day
opportunity
so
long
as
men
shall
be
on
earth
there
will
be
tasks
for
them
to
do
some
way
for
them
to
show
their
worth
each
day
shall
bring
its
problems
new
and
men
shall
dream
of
mightier
deeds
than
ever
have
been
done
before
there
always
shall
be
human
needs
for
men
to
work
and
struggle
for
the
sorrow
tugs
there
a
lot
of
joy
in
the
smiling
world
there
plenty
of
morning
sun
and
laughter
and
songs
and
dances
too
whenever
the
day
work
done
full
many
an
hour
is
a
shining
one
when
viewed
by
itself
apart
but
the
golden
threads
in
the
warp
of
life
are
the
sorrow
tugs
at
your
heart
oh
the
fun
is
froth
and
it
blows
away
and
many
a
joy
forgot
and
the
pleasures
come
and
the
pleasures
go
and
memory
holds
them
not
but
treasured
ever
you
keep
the
pain
that
causes
your
tears
to
start
for
the
sweetest
hours
are
the
ones
that
bring
the
sorrow
tugs
at
your
heart
the
lump
in
your
throat
and
the
little
sigh
when
your
baby
trudged
away
the
very
first
time
to
the
big
red
school
how
long
will
their
memory
stay
the
fever
days
and
the
long
black
nights
you
watched
as
she
troubled
slept
and
the
joy
you
felt
when
she
smiled
once
more
how
long
will
that
all
be
kept
the
glad
hours
live
in
a
feeble
way
but
the
sad
ones
never
die
his
first
long
trousers
caused
a
pang
and
you
saw
them
with
a
sigh
and
the
big
still
house
when
the
boy
and
girl
unto
youth
and
beauty
grown
to
college
went
will
you
forget
that
first
grim
hour
alone
it
seems
as
you
look
back
over
things
that
all
that
you
treasure
dear
is
somehow
blent
in
a
wondrous
way
with
a
heart
pang
and
a
tear
though
many
a
day
is
a
joyous
one
when
viewed
by
itself
apart
the
golden
threads
in
the
warp
of
life
are
the
sorrow
tugs
at
your
heart
only
a
dad
only
a
dad
with
a
tired
face
coming
home
from
the
daily
race
bringing
little
of
gold
or
fame
to
show
how
well
he
has
played
the
game
but
glad
in
his
heart
that
his
own
rejoice
to
see
him
come
and
to
hear
his
voice
only
a
dad
with
a
brood
of
four
one
of
ten
million
men
or
more
plodding
along
in
the
daily
strife
bearing
the
whips
and
the
scorns
of
life
with
never
a
whimper
of
pain
or
hate
for
the
sake
of
those
who
at
home
await
only
a
dad
neither
rich
nor
proud
merely
one
of
the
surging
crowd
toiling
striving
from
day
to
day
facing
whatever
may
come
his
way
silent
whenever
the
harsh
condemn
and
bearing
it
all
for
the
love
of
them
only
a
dad
but
he
gives
his
all
to
smooth
the
way
for
his
children
small
doing
with
courage
stern
and
grim
the
deeds
that
his
father
did
for
him
this
is
the
line
that
for
him
i
pen
only
a
dad
but
the
best
of
men
hard
knocks
i
not
the
man
to
say
that
failure
sweet
nor
tell
a
chap
to
laugh
when
things
go
wrong
i
know
it
hurts
to
have
to
take
defeat
an
no
one
likes
to
lose
before
a
throng
it
is
very
pleasant
not
to
win
when
you
have
done
the
very
best
you
could
but
if
you
down
get
up
an
buckle
in
a
lickin
often
does
a
fellow
good
i
seen
some
chaps
who
never
knew
their
power
until
somebody
knocked
to
the
floor
i
known
men
who
discovered
in
an
hour
a
courage
they
had
never
shown
before
i
seen
rise
from
failure
to
the
top
by
doin
things
they
had
understood
before
the
day
disaster
made
drop
a
lickin
often
does
a
fellow
good
success
is
not
the
teacher
wise
an
true
that
gruff
old
failure
is
remember
that
she
much
too
apt
to
make
a
fool
of
you
which
is
true
of
blows
that
knock
you
flat
hard
knocks
are
painful
things
an
hard
to
bear
an
most
of
us
would
dodge
if
we
could
there
something
mighty
broadening
in
care
a
lickin

does
a
fellow
good
spring
in
the
trenches
it
coming
time
for
planting
in
that
little
patch
of
ground
where
the
lad
and
i
made
merry
as
he
followed
me
around
now
the
sun
is
getting
higher
and
the
skies
above
are
blue
and
i
hungry
for
the
garden
and
i
wish
the
war
was
through
but
it
tramp
tramp
tramp
and
it
never
look
behind
and
when
you
see
a
stranger
kids
pretend
that
you
are
blind
the
spring
is
coming
back
again
the
birds
begin
to
mate
the
skies
are
full
of
kindness
but
the
world
is
full
of
hate
and
it
i
that
should
be
bending
now
in
peace
above
the
soil
with
laughing
eyes
and
little
hands
about
to
bless
the
toil
but
it
fight
fight
fight
and
it
charge
at
a
soldier
thinking
thoughts
of
home
is
one
more
soldier
sick
last
year
i
brought
the
bulbs
to
bloom
and
saw
the
roses
bud
this
year
i
ankle
deep
in
mire
and
most
of
it
is
blood
last
year
the
mother
in
the
door
was
glad
as
she
could
be
her
heart
is
full
of
pain
and
mine
is
hurting
me
but
it
shoot
shoot
shoot
and
when
the
bullets
hiss
do
let
the
tears
fill
up
your
eyes
for
weeping
soldiers
miss
oh
who
will
tend
the
roses
now
and
who
will
sow
the
seeds
and
who
will
do
the
heavy
work
the
little
garden
needs
and
who
will
tell
the
lad
of
mine
the
things
he
wants
to
know
and
take
his
hand
and
lead
him
round
the
paths
we
used
to
go
for
it
charge
charge
charge
and
it
face
the
foe
once
more
forget
the
things
you
love
the
most
and
keep
your
mind
on
gore
father
used
to
wonder
just
why
father
never
had
much
time
for
play
used
to
wonder
why
he
rather
work
each
minute
of
the
day
used
to
wonder
why
he
never
loafed
along
the
road
an
shirked
ca
recall
a
time
whenever
father
played
while
others
worked
father
did
dress
in
fashion
sort
of
hated
clothing
new
style
with
him
was
not
a
passion
he
had
other
things
in
view
boys
are
blind
to
much
that
going
on
about
day
by
day
and
i
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
became
of
father
pay
all
i
knew
was
when
i
needed
shoes
i
got
on
the
spot
everything
for
which
i
pleaded
somehow
father
always
got
wondered
season
after
season
why
he
never
took
a
rest
and
that
might
be
the
reason
then
i
never
even
guessed
father
set
a
store
on
knowledge
if
he
lived
to
have
his
way
he
have
sent
me
off
to
college
and
the
bills
been
glad
to
pay
that
i
know
was
his
ambition
now
and
then
he
used
to
say
he
have
done
his
earthly
mission
on
my
graduation
day
saw
his
cheeks
were
getting
paler
did
understand
just
why
saw
his
body
growing
frailer
then
at
last
i
saw
him
die
rest
had
come
his
tasks
were
ended
calm
was
written
on
his
brow
father
life
was
big
and
splendid
and
i
understand
it
now
laddies
show
me
the
boy
who
never
threw
a
stone
at
someone
cat
or
never
hurled
a
snowball
swift
at
someone
high
silk
hat
who
never
ran
away
from
school
to
seek
the
swimming
hole
or
slyly
from
a
neighbor
yard
green
apples
never
stole
show
me
the
boy
who
never
broke
a
pane
of
window
glass
who
never
disobeyed
the
sign
that
says
keep
off
the
grass
who
never
did
a
thousand
things
that
grieve
us
sore
to
tell
and
i
show
you
a
little
boy
who
must
be
far
from
well
the
living
beauties
i
never
knew
until
they
went
how
much
their
laughter
really
meant
i
never
knew
how
much
the
place
depended
on
each
little
face
how
barren
home
could
be
and
drear
without
its
living
beauties
here
i
never
knew
that
chairs
and
books
could
wear
such
sad
and
solemn
looks
that
rooms
and
halls
could
be
at
night
so
still
and
drained
of
all
delight
this
home
is
now
but
brick
and
board
where
bits
of
furniture
are
stored
i
used
to
think
i
loved
each
shelf
and
room
for
what
it
was
itself
and
once
i
thought
each
picture
fine
because
i
proudly
called
it
mine
but
now
i
know
they
mean
no
more
than
art
works
hanging
in
a
store
until
they
went
away
to
roam
i
never
knew
what
made
it
home
but
i
have
learned
that
all
is
base
however
wonderful
the
place
and
decked
with
costly
treasures
rare
unless
the
living
joys
are
there
at
breakfast
time
my
pa
he
eats
his
breakfast
in
a
funny
sort
of
way
we
hardly
ever
see
him
at
the
first
meal
of
the
day
ma
puts
his
food
before
him
and
he
settles
in
his
place
an
then
he
props
the
paper
up
and
we
ca
see
his
face
we
hear
him
blow
his
coffee
and
we
hear
him
chew
his
toast
but
it
for
the
morning
paper
that
he
seems
to
care
the
most
ma
says
that
little
children
mighty
grateful
ought
to
be
to
the
folks
that
fixed
the
evening
as
the
proper
time
for
tea
she
says
if
meals
were
only
served
to
people
once
a
day
an
that
was
in
the
morning
just
before
pa
goes
away
we
never
know
how
father
looked
when
he
was
in
his
place
coz
he
always
have
the
morning
paper
stuck
before
his
face
he
drinks
his
coffee
steamin
hot
an
passes
ma
his
cup
to
have
it
filled
a
second
time
an
never
once
looks
up
he
never
has
a
word
to
say
but
just
sits
there
an
reads
an
when
she
sees
his
hand
stuck
out
ma
gives
him
what
he
needs
she
guesses
what
it
is
he
wants
coz
it
no
use
to
ask
pa
got
to
read
his
paper
an
sometimes
that
quite
a
task
one
morning
we
had
breakfast
an
his
features
we
could
see
but
his
face
was
long
an
solemn
an
he
did
speak
to
me
an
we
could
get
him
laughin
an
we
could
make
him
smile
an
he
said
the
toast
was
soggy
an
the
coffee
simply
vile
then
ma
said
what
the
matter
why
are
you
so
cross
an
glum
an
pa
took
her
head
off
coz
the
paper
did
come
is
the
worst
word
that
written
or
spoken
doing
more
harm
here
than
slander
and
lies
on
it
is
many
a
strong
spirit
broken
and
with
it
many
a
good
purpose
dies
it
springs
from
the
lips
of
the
thoughtless
each
morning
and
robs
us
of
courage
we
need
through
the
day
it
rings
in
our
ears
like
a
warning
and
laughs
when
we
falter
and
fall
by
the
way
is
the
father
of
feeble
endeavor
the
parent
of
terror
and
work
it
weakens
the
efforts
of
artisans
clever
and
makes
of
the
toiler
an
indolent
shirk
it
poisons
the
soul
of
the
man
with
a
vision
it
stifles
in
infancy
many
a
plan
it
greets
honest
toiling
with
open
derision
and
mocks
at
the
hopes
and
the
dreams
of
a
man
is
a
word
none
should
speak
without
blushing
to
utter
it
should
be
a
symbol
of
shame
ambition
and
courage
it
daily
is
crushing
it
blights
a
man
purpose
and
shortens
his
aim
despise
it
with
all
of
your
hatred
of
error
refuse
it
the
lodgment
it
seeks
in
your
brain
arm
against
it
as
a
creature
of
terror
and
all
that
you
dream
of
you
some
day
shall
gain
is
the
word
that
is
foe
to
ambition
an
enemy
ambushed
to
shatter
your
will
its
prey
is
forever
the
man
with
a
mission
and
bows
but
to
courage
and
patience
and
skill
hate
it
with
hatred
that
deep
and
undying
for
once
it
is
welcomed
break
any
man
whatever
the
goal
you
are
seeking
keep
trying
and
answer
this
demon
by
saying

joys

man
who
wants
a
garden
fair
or
small
or
very
big
with
flowers
growing
here
and
there
must
bend
his
back
and
dig
the
things
are
mighty
few
on
earth
that
wishes
can
attain
we
want
of
any
worth
we
got
to
work
to
gain
it
matters
not
what
goal
you
seek
its
secret
here
reposes
you
got
to
dig
from
week
to
week
to
get
results
or
roses
the
other
fellow
are
you
fond
of
your
wife
and
your
children
fair
so
is
the
other
fellow
do
you
crave
pleasures
for
them
to
share
so
does
the
other
fellow
does
your
heart
rejoice
when
your
own
are
glad
and
are
you
troubled
when
they
are
sad
well
it
that
way
too
in
this
life
my
lad
that
way
with
the
other
fellow
do
you
want
the
best
for
your
own
to
know
so
does
the
other
fellow
do
you
stoop
to
kiss
them
before
you
go
so
does
the
other
fellow
when
your
baby
lies
on
a
fevered
bed
does
your
heart
run
cold
with
a
silent
dread
well
it
that
way
too
where
all
mortals
tread
that
way
with
the
other
fellow
does
it
hurt
when
they
want
what
you
can
not
buy
it
does
with
the
other
fellow
do
you
for
their
comfort
yourself
deny
so
does
the
other
fellow
would
you
wail
aloud
if
your
babe
should
die
for
the
lack
of
care
you
could
not
supply
well
it
that
way
too
as
he
travels
by
that
way
with
the
other
fellow
our
duty
to
our
flag
less
hate
and
greed
is
what
we
need
and
more
of
service
true
more
men
to
love
the
flag
above
and
keep
it
first
in
view
less
boast
and
brag
about
the
flag
more
faith
in
what
it
means
more
heads
erect
more
less
talk
of
war
machines
the
time
to
fight
to
keep
it
bright
is
not
along
the
way
nor
the
foam
but
here
at
home
within
ourselves
is
we
must
love
that
flag
above
with
all
our
might
and
main
for
from
our
hands
not
distant
lands
shall
come
dishonor
stain
if
that
flag
be
dishonored
we
have
done
it
not
the
foe
if
it
shall
fall
we
first
of
all
shall
be
to
strike
a
blow
the
hunter
cheek
that
is
tanned
to
the
wind
of
the
north
body
that
jests
at
the
bite
of
the
cold
limbs
that
are
eager
and
strong
to
go
forth
into
the
wilds
and
the
ways
of
the
bold
red
blood
that
pulses
and
throbs
in
the
veins
ears
that
love
silences
better
than
noise
strength
of
the
forest
and
health
of
the
plains
these
the
rewards
that
the
hunter
enjoys
forests
were
ever
the
cradles
of
men
manhood
is
born
of
a
kinship
with
trees
whence
shall
come
brave
hearts
and
stout
muscles
when
woods
have
made
way
for
our
cities
of
ease
oh
do
you
wonder
that
stalwarts
return
yearly
to
hark
to
the
whispering
oaks
is
for
the
brave
days
of
old
that
they
yearn
these
are
the
splendors
the
hunter
invokes
it
september
it
september
and
the
orchards
are
afire
with
red
and
gold
and
the
nights
with
dew
are
heavy
and
the
morning
sharp
with
cold
now
the
garden
at
its
gayest
with
the
salvia
blazing
red
and
the
good
asters
laughing
at
us
from
their
bed
once
again
in
shoes
and
stockings
are
the
little
feet
and
the
dog
now
does
his
snoozing
on
the
bright
side
of
the
street
it
september
and
the
cornstalks
are
as
high
as
they
will
go
and
the
red
cheeks
of
the
apples
everywhere
begin
to
show
now
the
supper
scarcely
over
ere
the
darkness
settles
down
and
the
moon
looms
big
and
yellow
at
the
edges
of
the
town
oh
it
good
to
see
the
children
when
their
little
prayers
are
said
duck
beneath
the
patchwork
covers
when
they
tumble
into
bed
it
september
and
a
calmness
and
a
sweetness
seem
to
fall
over
everything
that
living
just
as
though
it
hears
the
call
of
old
winter
trudging
slowly
with
his
pack
of
ice
and
snow
in
the
distance
over
yonder
and
it
somehow
seems
as
though
every
tiny
little
blossom
wants
to
look
its
very
best
when
the
frost
shall
bite
its
petals
and
it
droops
away
to
rest
it
september
it
the
fullness
and
the
ripeness
of
the
year
all
the
work
of
earth
is
finished
or
the
final
tasks
are
near
but
there
is
no
doleful
wailing
every
living
thing
that
grows
for
the
end
that
is
approaching
wears
the
finest
garb
it
knows
and
i
pray
that
i
may
proudly
hold
my
head
up
high
and
smile
when
i
come
to
my
september
in
the
golden
afterwhile
how
do
you
tackle
your
work
how
do
you
tackle
your
work
each
day
are
you
scared
of
the
job
you
find
do
you
grapple
the
task
that
comes
your
way
with
a
confident
easy
mind
do
you
stand
right
up
to
the
work
ahead
or
fearfully
pause
to
view
it
do
you
start
to
toil
with
a
sense
of
dread
or
feel
that
you
going
to
do
it
you
can
do
as
much
as
you
think
you
can
but
you
never
accomplish
more
if
you
afraid
of
yourself
young
man
there
little
for
you
in
store
for
failure
comes
from
the
inside
first
it
there
if
we
only
knew
it
and
you
can
win
though
you
face
the
worst
if
you
feel
that
you
going
to
do
it
success
it
found
in
the
soul
of
you
and
not
in
the
realm
of
luck
the
world
will
furnish
the
work
to
do
but
you
must
provide
the
pluck
you
can
do
whatever
you
think
you
can
it
all
in
the
way
you
view
it
it
all
in
the
start
that
you
make
young
man
you
must
feel
that
you
going
to
do
it
how
do
you
tackle
your
work
each
day
with
confidence
clear
or
dread
what
to
yourself
do
you
stop
and
say
when
a
new
task
lies
ahead
what
is
the
thought
that
is
in
your
mind
is
fear
ever
running
through
it
if
so
just
tackle
the
next
you
find
by
thinking
you
going
to
do
it
life
life
is
a
gift
to
be
used
every
day
not
to
be
smothered
and
hidden
away
it
is
a
thing
to
be
stored
in
the
chest
where
you
gather
your
keepsakes
and
treasure
your
best
it
is
a
joy
to
be
sipped
now
and
then
and
promptly
put
back
in
a
dark
place
again
life
is
a
gift
that
the
humblest
may
boast
of
and
one
that
the
humblest
may
well
make
the
most
of
get
out
and
live
it
each
hour
of
the
day
wear
it
and
use
it
as
much
as
you
may
do
keep
it
in
niches
and
corners
and
grooves
you
find
that
in
service
its
beauty
improves
story
telling
most
every
night
when
they
in
bed
and
both
their
little
prayers
have
said
they
shout
for
me
to
come
upstairs
and
tell
them
tales
of
gypsies
bold
and
eagles
with
the
claws
that
hold
a
baby
weight
and
fairy
sprites
that
roam
the
woods
on
starry
nights
and
i
must
illustrate
these
tales
must
imitate
the
northern
gales
that
toss
the
indian
canoe
and
show
the
way
he
paddles
too
if
in
the
story
comes
a
bear
i
have
to
pause
and
sniff
the
air
and
show
the
way
he
climbs
the
trees
to
steal
the
honey
from
the
bees
and
then
i
buzz
like
angry
bees
and
sting
him
on
his
nose
and
knees
and
howl
in
pain
till
mother
cries
that
pair
will
never
shut
their
eyes
while
all
that
noise
up
there
you
make
you
simply
keeping
them
awake
and
then
they
whisper
just
one
more
and
once
again
i
forced
to
roar
new
stories
every
night
they
ask
and
that
is
not
an
easy
task
i
have
to
be
so
many
things
the
frog
that
croaks
the
lark
that
sings
the
cunning
fox
the
frightened
hen
but
just
last
night
they
stumped
me
when
they
wanted
me
to
twist
and
squirm
and
imitate
an
angle
worm
at
last
they
tumble
off
to
sleep
and
softly
from
their
room
i
creep
and
brush
and
comb
the
shock
of
hair
i
tossed
about
to
be
a
bear
then
mother
says
well
i
should
say
you
just
as
much
a
child
as
they
but
you
can
bet
i
not
resign
that
story
telling
job
of
mine
canning
time
there
a
wondrous
smell
of
spices
in
the
kitchen
most
bewitchin
there
are
fruits
cut
into
slices
that
just
set
the
palate
itchin
there
the
sound
of
spoon
on
platter
and
the
rattle
and
the
clatter
and
a
bunch
of
kids
are
to
the
splendid
joy
of
tastin
it
the
fragrant
time
of
year
when
days
are
here
there
a
good
wife
gayly
and
some
and
tirin
and
while
jar
on
jar
she
and
the
necks
o
them
she
i
here
an
of
the
kettles
that
are
steamin
and
the
cares
that
have
been
all
have
vanished
in
the
bubblin
i
am
happy
that
i
here
at
the
cannin
time
of
year
lord
i
sorry
for
the
feller
that
is
all
the
of
the
juices
red
and
yeller
and
can
never
sit
and
listen
to
the
rattle
and
the
clatter
of
the
sound
of
spoon
on
platter
i
am
sorry
for
the
single
for
they
miss
the
thrill
and
tingle
of
the
splendid
time
of
year
when
the
cannin
days
are
here
the
dull
road
it
the
dull
road
that
leads
to
the
gay
road
the
practice
that
leads
to
success
the
work
road
that
leads
to
the
play
road
it
is
trouble
that
breeds
happiness
it
the
hard
work
and
merciless
grinding
that
purchases
glory
and
fame
it
repeatedly
doing
nor
minding
the
drudgery
drear
of
the
game
it
the
passing
up
glamor
or
pleasure
for
the
sake
of
the
skill
we
may
gain
and
in
giving
up
comfort
or
leisure
for
the
joy
that
we
hope
to
attain
it
the
hard
road
of
trying
and
learning
of
toiling
uncheered
and
alone
that
wins
us
the
prizes
worth
earning
and
leads
us
to
goals
we
would
own
the
apple
tree
when
an
apple
tree
is
ready
for
the
world
to
come
and
eat
there
is
any
structure
in
the
land
got
it
beat
there
nothing
man
has
builded
with
the
beauty
or
the
charm
that
can
touch
the
simple
grandeur
of
the
monarch
of
the
farm
there
never
any
picture
from
a
human
being
brush
that
has
ever
caught
the
redness
of
a
single
apple
blush
when
an
apple
tree
in
blossom
it
is
glorious
to
see
but
that
just
a
hint
at
springtime
of
the
better
things
to
be
that
is
just
a
fairy
promise
from
the
great
magician
wand
of
the
wonders
and
the
splendors
that
are
waiting
just
beyond
the
distant
edge
of
summer
just
a
forecast
of
the
treat
when
the
apple
tree
is
ready
for
the
world
to
come
and
eat
architects
of
splendid
vision
long
have
labored
on
the
earth
and
have
raised
their
dreams
in
marble
and
we
marveled
at
their
worth
long
the
spires
of
costly
churches
have
looked
upward
at
the
sky
rich
in
promise
and
in
the
beauty
they
have
cheered
the
but
i
sure
there
nothing
finer
for
the
eye
of
man
to
meet
than
an
apple
tree
that
ready
for
the
world
to
come
and
eat
there
the
promise
of
the
apples
red
and
gleaming
in
the
sun
like
the
medals
worn
by
mortals
as
rewards
for
labors
done
and
the
big
arms
stretched
wide
open
with
a
welcome
warm
and
true
in
a
way
that
sets
you
thinking
it
intended
just
for
you
there
is
nothing
with
a
beauty
so
entrancing
so
complete
as
an
apple
tree
that
ready
for
the
world
to
come
and
eat
the
some
folks
leave
home
for
money
and
some
leave
home
for
fame
some
seek
skies
always
sunny
and
some
depart
in
shame
i
care
not
what
the
reason
men
travel
east
and
west
or
what
the
month
or
season
the
is
the
best
the
is
the
glad
town
where
something
real
abides
is
not
the
town
that
all
its
spirit
hides
though
strangers
scoff
and
flout
it
and
even
jeer
its
name
it
has
a
charm
about
it
no
other
town
can
claim
the
skies
seem
bluer
than
skies
that
stretch
away
the
friends
seem
truer
and
kinder
through
the
day
and
whether
glum
or
cheery
or
depressed
or
or
weary
i
like
the
best
let
him
who
will
go
wander
to
distant
towns
to
live
of
some
things
i
am
fonder
than
all
they
have
to
give
the
gold
of
distant
places
could
not
repay
me
quite
for
those
familiar
faces
that
keep
the
bright
take
home
a
smile
take
home
a
smile
forget
the
petty
cares
the
dull
grim
grind
of
all
the
day
affairs
the
day
is
done
come
be
yourself
awhile
to
those
who
wait
take
home
a
smile
take
home
a
smile
do
scatter
grief
and
gloom
where
laughter
and
light
hearts
should
always
bloom
what
though
you
traveled
many
a
dusty
mile
footsore
and
weary
still
take
home
a
smile
take
home
a
smile
it
is
not
much
to
do
but
much
it
means
to
them
who
wait
for
you
you
can
be
brave
for
such
a
little
while
the
day
of
doubt
is
done
take
home
a
smile
courage
courage
is
a
brilliant
dash
a
daring
deed
in
a
moment
flash
it
is
an
instantaneous
thing
born
of
despair
with
a
sudden
spring
it
is
a
creature
of
flickered
hope
or
the
final
tug
at
a
slipping
rope
but
it
something
deep
in
the
soul
of
man
that
is
working
always
to
serve
some
plan
courage
is
the
last
resort
in
the
work
of
life
or
the
game
of
sport
it
is
a
thing
that
a
man
can
call
at
some
future
time
when
he
apt
to
fall
if
he
has
it
now
he
will
have
it
not
when
the
strain
is
great
and
the
pace
is
hot
for
who
would
strive
for
a
distant
goal
must
always
have
courage
within
his
soul
courage
is
a
dazzling
light
that
flashes
and
passes
away
from
sight
it
a
slow
unwavering
ingrained
trait
with
the
patience
to
work
and
the
strength
to
wait
it
part
of
a
man
when
his
skies
are
blue
it
part
of
him
when
he
has
work
to
do
the
brave
man
never
is
freed
of
it
he
has
it
when
there
is
no
need
of
it
courage
was
never
designed
for
show
it
is
a
thing
that
can
come
and
go
it
written
in
victory
and
defeat
and
every
trial
a
man
may
meet
it
part
of
his
hours
his
days
and
his
years
back
of
his
smiles
and
behind
his
tears
courage
is
more
than
a
daring
deed
it
the
breath
of
life
and
a
strong
man
creed
greatness
we
can
be
great
by
helping
one
another
we
can
be
loved
for
very
simple
deeds
who
has
the
grateful
mention
of
a
brother
has
really
all
the
honor
that
he
needs
we
can
be
famous
for
our
works
of
kindness
fame
is
not
born
alone
of
strength
or
skill
it
sometimes
comes
from
deafness
and
from
blindness
to
petty
words
and
faults
and
loving
still
we
can
be
rich
in
gentle
smiles
and
sunny
a
jeweled
soul
exceeds
a
royal
crown
the
richest
men
sometimes
have
little
money
and
croesus
oft
the
poorest
man
in
town
the
epicure
i
sipped
a
rich
man
sparkling
wine
his
silverware
i
handled
i
placed
these
battered
legs
of
mine
tables
gayly
candled
i
dine
on
rare
and
costly
fare
good
fortune
lets
me
but
there
no
meal
that
can
compare
with
those
the
missus
gets
me
i
had
your
steaks
three
inches
thick
with
all
your
sam
ward
trimming
i
had
the
breast
of
chick
in
luscious
gravy
swimming
to
dine
in
swell
cafe
or
club
but
irritates
and
frets
me
give
me
the
plain
and
wholesome
grub
the
grub
the
missus
gets
me
two
kiddies
smiling
at
the
board
the
cook
right
at
the
table
the
four
of
us
a
hungry
horde
to
beat
that
none
is
able
a
big
meat
pie
with
flaky
crust
is
then
that
joy
besets
me
oh
i
could
eat
until
i
bust
those
meals
the
missus
gets
me
the
gentle
gardener
i
like
to
leave
but
daffodills
to
mark
my
little
way
to
leave
but
tulips
red
and
white
behind
me
as
i
stray
i
like
to
pass
away
from
earth
and
feel
left
behind
but
roses
and
for
all
who
come
to
find
i
like
to
sow
the
barren
spots
with
all
the
flowers
of
earth
to
leave
a
path
where
those
who
come
should
find
but
gentle
mirth
and
when
at
last
i
called
upon
to
join
the
heavenly
throng
i
like
to
feel
along
my
way
i
left
no
sign
of
wrong
and
yet
the
cares
are
many
and
the
hours
of
toil
are
few
there
is
not
time
enough
on
earth
for
all
like
to
do
but
having
lived
and
having
toiled
i
like
the
world
to
find
some
little
touch
of
beauty
that
my
soul
had
left
behind
the
finest
age
when
he
was
only
nine
months
old
and
plump
and
round
and
pink
of
cheek
a
joy
to
tickle
and
to
hold
before
he
even
learned
to
speak
his
gentle
mother
used
to
say
it
is
too
bad
that
he
must
grow
if
i
could
only
have
my
way
his
baby
ways
we
always
know
and
then
the
year
was
turned
and
he
began
to
toddle
round
the
floor
and
name
the
things
that
he
could
see
and
soil
the
dresses
that
he
wore
then
many
a
night
she
whispered
low
our
baby
now
is
such
a
joy
i
hate
to
think
that
he
must
grow
to
be
a
wild
and
heedless
boy
but
on
he
went
and
sweeter
grew
and
then
his
mother
i
recall
wished
she
could
keep
him
always
two
for
that
the
finest
age
of
all
she
thought
the
selfsame
thing
at
three
and
now
that
he
is
four
she
sighs
to
think
he
can
not
always
be
the
youngster
with
the
laughing
eyes
oh
little
boy
my
wish
is
not
always
to
keep
you
four
years
old
each
night
i
stand
beside
your
cot
and
think
of
what
the
years
may
hold
and
looking
down
on
you
i
pray
that
when
we
lost
our
baby
small
the
mother
of
our
man
will
say
this
is
the
finest
age
of
all
success
and
failure
i
do
not
think
all
failure
undeserved
and
all
success
is
merely
someone
luck
some
men
are
down
because
they
were
unnerved
and
some
are
up
because
they
kept
their
pluck
some
men
are
down
because
they
chose
to
shirk
some
men
are
high
because
they
did
their
work
i
do
not
think
that
all
the
poor
are
good
that
riches
are
the
uniform
of
shame
the
beggar
might
have
conquered
if
he
would
and
that
he
begs
the
world
is
not
to
blame
misfortune
is
not
all
that
comes
to
mar
most
men
themselves
have
shaped
the
things
they
are
youth
the
skies
are
blue
and
the
sun
is
out
and
the
grass
is
green
and
soft
and
the
old
charm
back
in
the
apple
tree
and
it
calls
a
boy
aloft
and
the
same
low
voice
that
the
old
do
hear
but
the
youngsters
do
is
calling
them
to
the
fields
and
streams
and
the
joys
that
once
i
knew
and
if
youth
be
wild
desire
for
play
and
care
is
the
mark
of
men
beneath
the
skin
that
time
has
tanned
i
a
madcap
youngster
then
far
richer
than
king
with
his
crown
of
gold
and
his
heavy
weight
of
care
is
the
sunburned
boy
with
his
feet
and
his
tousled
shock
of
hair
for
the
king
can
hear
but
the
cry
of
hate
or
the
sickly
sound
of
praise
and
lost
to
him
are
the
voices
sweet
that
called
in
his
boyhood
days
far
better
than
ruler
with
pomp
and
power
and
riches
is
it
to
be
the
urchin
gay
in
his
tattered
clothes
that
is
climbing
the
apple
tree
oh
once
i
heard
all
the
calls
that
come
to
the
quick
glad
ears
of
boys
and
a
certain
spot
on
the
river
bank
told
me
of
its
many
joys
and
certain
fields
and
certain
trees
were
loyal
friends
to
me
and
i
knew
the
birds
and
i
owned
a
dog
and
we
both
could
hear
and
see
oh
never
from
tongues
of
men
have
dropped
such
messages
wholly
glad
as
the
things
that
live
in
the
great
outdoors
once
told
to
a
little
lad
and
i
sorry
for
him
who
can
not
hear
what
the
tall
trees
have
to
say
who
is
deaf
to
the
call
of
a
running
stream
and
the
lanes
that
lead
to
play
the
boy
that
shins
up
the
faithful
elm
or
sprawls
on
a
river
bank
is
more
richly
blessed
with
the
joys
of
life
than
any
old
man
of
rank
for
youth
is
the
golden
time
of
life
and
this
battered
old
heart
of
mine
beats
fast
to
the
march
of
its
joys
when
the
sun
begins
to
shine
my
paw
said
so
foxes
can
talk
if
you
know
how
to
listen
my
paw
said
so
owls
have
big
eyes
that
sparkle
an
glisten
my
paw
said
so
bears
can
turn
an
climb
ellum
trees
an
steal
all
the
honey
away
from
the
bees
an
they
never
mind
winter
becoz
they
freeze
my
paw
said
so
girls
is
of
a
snake
but
boys
ai
my
paw
said
so
they
holler
an
run
an
sometimes
they
faint
my
paw
said
so
but
boys
would
be
to
be
frightened
that
way
when
all
that
the
snake
wants
to
do
is
to
play
you
got
to
believe
every
word
that
i
say
my
paw
said
so
wolves
ai
so
bad
if
you
treat
all
right
my
paw
said
so
they
as
fond
of
a
game
as
they
are
of
a
fight
my
paw
said
so
an
all
of
the
animals
found
in
the
wood
ai
always
ferocious
most
times
they
are
good
the
trouble
is
mostly
they
misunderstood
my
paw
said
so
you
can
think
what
you
like
but
i
stick
to
it
when
my
paw
said
so
an
i
keep
right
on
sayin
again
an
again
my
paw
said
so
maybe
foxes
do
talk
to
such
people
as
you
an
bears
never
show
you
the
tricks
they
can
do
but
i
know
that
the
stories
i
tellin
are
true
my
paw
said
so
preparedness
right
must
not
live
in
idleness
nor
dwell
in
smug
content
it
must
be
strong
against
the
throng
of
foes
on
evil
bent
justice
must
not
a
weakling
be
but
it
must
guard
its
own
and
live
each
day
that
none
can
say
justice
is
overthrown
peace
the
sweet
glory
of
the
world
faces
a
duty
too
death
is
her
fate
leaves
she
one
gate
for
war
to
enter
through
the
peaceful
warriors
let
others
sing
their
songs
of
war
and
chant
their
hymns
of
splendid
death
let
others
praise
the
soldiers
ways
and
hail
the
cannon
flaming
breath
let
others
sing
of
glory
fields
where
blood
for
victory
is
paid
i
choose
to
sing
some
simple
thing
to
those
who
wield
not
gun
or
blade
the
peaceful
warriors
of
trade
let
others
choose
the
deeds
of
war
for
symbols
of
our
nation
skill
the
coat
the
rattling
throat
the
regiment
that
charged
the
hill
the
boy
who
died
to
serve
the
flag
who
heard
the
order
and
obeyed
but
leave
to
me
the
gallantry
of
those
who
labor
unafraid
the
peaceful
warriors
of
trade
aye
let
me
sing
the
splendid
deeds
of
those
who
toil
to
serve
mankind
the
men
who
break
old
ways
and
make
new
paths
for
those
who
come
behind
and
face
their
problems
unafraid
who
think
and
plan
to
lift
for
man
the
burden
that
on
him
is
laid
the
splendid
warriors
of
trade
i
sing
of
battles
with
disease
and
victories
death
and
pain
of
ships
that
fly
the
summer
sky
and
glorious
deeds
of
strength
and
brain
the
call
for
help
that
rings
through
space
by
which
a
vessel
course
is
stayed
thrills
me
far
more
than
fields
of
gore
or
heroes
decked
in
golden
braid
i
sing
the
warriors
of
trade

there
a

of
goodness
in
the
yellow

and
i
sort
o
like
to
linger
round
a
berry
patch
at
morn
oh
the
lord
has
set
our
table
with
a
stock
things
to
eat
an
there
just
enough
o
bitter
in
the
blend
to
cut
the

but
i
run
the
whole
list
over
an
it
seems
somehow
that
i
find
the
keenest
sort
o
pleasure
in
a
chunk
o
raisin
pie
there
are
pies
that
start
the
water
circulatin
in
the

there
are
pies
that
wear
the
flavor
of
the
warm
an
sunny
south
some
with
oriental
spices
spur
the
drowsy
appetite
an
just
fill
a
fellow

with
a
thrill
real
delight
but
for
downright
solid
goodness
that
comes
drippin
from

there
is
nothing
quite

to
its

hold
to

life
tests
if
never
a
sorrow
came
to
us
and
never
a
care
we
knew
if
every
hope
were
realized
and
every
dream
came
true
if
only
joy
were
found
on
earth
and
no
one
ever
sighed
and
never
a
friend
proved
false
to
us
and
never
a
loved
one
died
and
never
a
burden
bore
us
down
and
weary
too
we
yearn
for
tests
to
prove
our
worth
and
tasks
for
us
to
do
the
ready
artists
the
green
is
in
the
meadow
and
the
blue
is
in
the
sky
and
all
of
nature
artists
have
their
colors
handy
by
with
a
few
days
bright
with
sunshine
and
a
few
nights
free
from
frost
they
will
start
to
splash
their
colors
quite
regardless
of
the
cost
there
an
artist
waiting
ready
at
each
bleak
and
dismal
spot
to
paint
the
flashing
tulip
or
the
meek
may
is
lurking
in
the
distance
and
her
lap
is
filled
with
flowers
and
the
choicest
of
her
blossoms
very
shortly
will
be
ours
there
is
not
a
lane
so
dreary
or
a
field
so
dark
with
gloom
but
that
soon
will
be
resplendent
with
its
little
touch
of
bloom
there
an
artist
keen
and
eager
to
make
beautiful
each
scene
and
remove
with
colors
gorgeous
every
trace
of
of
what
has
been
oh
the
world
is
now
in
mourning
round
about
us
all
are
spread
the
ruins
and
the
symbols
of
the
winter
that
is
dead
but
the
bleak
and
barren
picture
very
shortly
now
will
pass
for
the
halls
of
life
are
ready
for
their
velvet
rugs
of
grass
and
the
painters
now
are
waiting
with
their
magic
to
replace
this
dullness
with
a
beauty
that
no
mortal
hand
can
trace
the
green
is
in
the
meadow
and
the
blue
is
in
the
sky
the
chill
of
death
is
passing
life
will
shortly
greet
the
eye
we
shall
revel
soon
in
colors
only
artists
make
and
the
humblest
plant
that
sleeping
unto
beauty
shall
awake
for
there
not
a
leaf
forgotten
not
a
twig
neglected
there
and
the
tiniest
of
pansies
shall
the
royal
purple
wear
the
happiest
days
you
do
not
know
it
little
man
in
your
summer
coat
of
tan
and
your
legs
bereft
of
hose
and
your
peeling
sunburned
nose
with
a
stone
bruise
on
your
toe
almost
limping
as
you
go
running
on
your
way
to
play
through
another
summer
day
friend
of
birds
and
streams
and
trees
that
your
happiest
days
are
these
little
do
you
think
as
you
hurry
to
your
play
that
a
lot
of
us
grown
old
in
the
chase
for
fame
and
gold
watch
you
as
you
pass
along
gayly
whistling
bits
of
song
and
in
envy
sit
and
dream
of
a
stream
where
long
buried
are
the
joys
we
possessed
when
we
were
boys
little
chap
you
can
not
guess
all
your
sum
of
happiness
little
value
do
you
place
on
your
sunburned
freckled
face
and
if
some
shrewd
fairy
came
offering
sums
of
gold
and
fame
for
your
summer
days
of
play
you
would
barter
them
away
and
believe
that
you
had
made
there
and
then
a
clever
trade
time
was
we
were
boys
like
you
bare
of
foot
and
sunburned
too
and
like
you
we
never
guessed
all
the
riches
we
possessed
we
have
traded
them
back
then
for
the
hollow
joys
of
men
we
have
given
them
all
to
be
rich
and
wise
and
for
life
never
teaches
boys
just
how
precious
are
their
joys
youth
has
fled
and
we
are
old
some
of
us
have
fame
and
gold
some
of
us
are
sorely
scarred
for
the
way
of
age
is
hard
and
we
envy
little
man
you
your
splendid
coat
of
tan
envy
you
your
treasures
rare
hours
of
joy
beyond
compare
for
we
know
by
teaching
stern
all
that
some
day
you
must
learn
the
real
bait
to
gentle
ways
i
am
inclined
i
have
no
wish
to
kill
to
creatures
dumb
i
would
be
kind
i
like
them
all
but
still
right
now
i
think
i
like
to
be
beside
some
rippling
brook
and
grab
a
worm
i
brought
with
me
and
slip
him
on
a
hook
i
like
to
put
my
hand
once
more
into
a
rusty
can
and
turn
those
squirmy
creatures
like
nuggets
in
a
pan
and
for
a
big
one
once
again
with
eager
eyes
i
look
as
did
a
boy
i
knew
and
then
impale
it
on
a
hook
i
had
my
share
of
fishing
joy
i
fished
with
patent
bait
with
chub
and
minnow
but
the
boy
is
lord
of
sport
estate
and
no
such
pleasure
comes
to
man
so
rare
as
when
he
took
a
worm
from
a
tomato
can
and
slipped
it
on
a
hook
i
like
to
gaze
with
glowing
eyes
upon
that
precious
bait
to
view
each
fat
worm
as
a
prize
to
be
accounted
great
and
though
i
passed
from
boyhood
term
and
opened
age
book
i
still
would
like
to
put
a
worm
that
wriggled
on
a
hook
true
nobility
who
does
his
task
from
day
to
day
and
meets
whatever
comes
his
way
believing
god
has
willed
it
so
has
found
real
greatness
here
below
who
guards
his
post
no
matter
where
believing
god
must
need
him
there
although
but
lowly
toil
it
be
has
risen
to
nobility
for
great
and
low
there
but
one
test
is
that
each
man
shall
do
his
best
who
works
with
all
the
strength
he
can
shall
never
die
in
debt
to

to
pause
to
listen
to
a
whiner
cause
it
has
no
time
to
stop
and
pet
the
sulker
in
a
peevish
fret
who
wails
he
neither
work
nor
play
because
things
have
gone
his
way
the

keeps
plodding
right
along

gives
its

to
all
who

the
grit
to

of
the

this

every
man

out
and
do
the
best
you
can

too
busy

implore
the
beaten
one
to
try
once
more
help
him
if
he
wants
to
rise
and
boost
him
if
he
bravely
tries
and
shows
determination
grim
but
it
wo
stop
to
baby
him
the

is
occupied
with
men
who
fall
but
quickly
rise
again
but
those
who
whine
because
they
hit
and
step
aside
to
sulk
a
bit
are
doomed
some
day
to
wake
and
find
the

behind

not

i
hold
any

i
would
be

for
the
good
i
can
do
i
would

may
lose

be
forgotten
or
fade
any
reward
we
may
choose

the
account
still
unpaid
but
little
real
happiness
lies
in
fighting
alone
for
a
prize
give
me
the
thrill
of
the
task
the
joy
of
the
battle
and
strife
of
being
of
use

i
ask
no
greater
reward
from
this

than

times
that
ma
ca
find
her

how
we
have
to
hustle
round
for
it
to
help
her

there
another
care
we
know
that
often
comes
our
way
i
guess
it
happens
easily
a
dozen
times
a
day
it
starts
when
first
the
postman
through
the
door
a
letter
passes
and
ma
says
goodness
gracious
me
wherever
are
my
glasses
we
hunt
on
the
mantelpiece
an
by
the
kitchen
sink
until
ma
says
now

stop
an
give
me
time
to
think
just
when
it
was
i
used
last

just
exactly
where
yes

know

sure
you

busy

runs
across

missing
pair
of
glasses
we
found
in
the

an
we
found
in

we
found
in
the
sugar
bowl
an
once
we
looked
an
hour
before
we
came
across
in
the
padding
of
her
chair
an
many
a
time
we
found
in
the
topknot
of
her
hair
it
a
search
that
ruins
order
an
the
home
completely
wrecks
for
there
no
place
where
you
may
not
find

mighty
glad

you
that
the
duty
ours
to
do
an

hope
to
hunt
those

till
our
time
of

is
through

a
little
bit
of
service
that
is
joyous
in
its
thrill

a
task
that
calls
us
daily
an
we
hope
it
always
will

man
as
to
flee
from
the
city
and
lie
full
length
in
the
shade
of
a
whispering
tree
and
gaze
at
the
sky
out
there
where
the
strife
and
the
greed
are
forgot
and
the
struggle
for
pelf
a
man
can
get
rid
of
each
taint
and
each
spot
and
clean
up
himself
he
can
be
what
he
wanted
to
be
when
a
boy
if
only
in
dreams
and
revel
once
more
in
the
depths
of
a
joy
that
as
real
as
it
seems
the
things
that
he
hates
never
follow
him
there
the
jar
of
the
street
the
rivalries
petty
the
struggling
unfair
for
the
open
is
sweet
in
purity
realm
he
can
rest
and
be
clean
be
he
humble
or
great
and
as
peaceful
his
soul
may
become
as
the
scene
that
his
eyes
contemplate
it
is
good
for
the
world
that
men
hunger
to
go
to
the
banks
of
a
stream
and
weary
of
sham
and
of
pomp
and
of
show
they
have
somewhere
to
dream
for
this
life
would
be
dreary
and
sordid
and
base
did
they
not
now
and
then
seek
refreshment
and
calm
in
god
wide
open
space
and
come
back
to
be
men
the
happy
slow
thinker
full
many
a
time
a
thought
has
come
that
had
a
bitter
meaning
in
it
and
in
the
conversation
hum
i
lost
it
ere
i
could
begin
it
i
had
it
on
my
tongue
to
spring
some
poisoned
quip
that
i
thought
clever
then
something
happened
and
the
sting
unuttered
went
and
died
forever
a
lot
of
bitter
thoughts
i
had
to
silence
fellows
and
to
flay
but
next
day
always
i
been
glad
i
was
quick
enough
to
say
the
kids
are
once
more
the
heavy
leggins
that
they
wore
the
winter
caps
that
covered
ears
are
put
away
and
no
more
tears
are
shed
because
they
can
not
go
until
they
bundled
up
just
so
no
more
she
wonders
when
they
gone
if
they
have
put
their
rubbers
on
no
longer
are
they
hourly
told
to
guard
themselves
against
a
cold
bareheaded
now
they
romp
and
run
warmed
only
by
the
kindly
sun
she
put
their
heavy
clothes
away
and
turned
the
children
out
to
play
and
all
the
morning
long
they
race
like
madcaps
round
about
the
place
the
robins
on
the
fences
sing
a
gayer
song
of
welcoming
and
seems
as
though
they
had
a
share
in
all
the
fun
they
having
there
the
wrens
and
sparrows
twitter
too
a
louder
and
a
noisier
crew
as
though
it
pleased
them
all
to
see
the
youngsters
out
of
doors
and
free
outdoors
they
scamper
to
their
play
with
merry
din
the
livelong
day
and
hungrily
they
jostle
in
the
favor
of
the
maid
to
win
then
armed
with
cookies
or
with
cake
their
way
into
the
yard
they
make
and
every
feathered
playmate
comes
to
gather
up
his
share
of
crumbs
the
finest
garden
that
i
know
is
one
where
little
children
grow
where
cheeks
turn
brown
and
eyes
are
bright
and
all
is
laughter
and
delight
oh
you
may
brag
of
gardens
fine
but
let
the
children
race
in
mine
and
let
the
roses
white
and
red
make
gay
the
ground
whereon
they
tread
and
who
for
bloom
perfection
seeks
should
mark
the
color
on
their
cheeks
no
music
that
the
robin
spouts
is
equal
to
their
merry
shouts
there
is
no
foliage
to
compare
with
youngsters
tousled
hair
spring
greatest
joy
beyond
a
doubt
is
when
it
brings
the
children
out
real
singing
you
can
talk
about
your
music
and
your
operatic
airs
and
your
phonographic
record
that
tenor
bears
but
there
is
any
music
that
such
wondrous
joy
can
bring
like
the
concert
when
the
kiddies
and
their
mother
start
to
sing
when
the
supper
time
is
over
then
the
mother
starts
to
play
some
simple
little
ditty
and
our
concert
under
way
and
i
happier
and
richer
than
a
millionaire
or
king
when
i
listen
to
the
kiddies
and
their
mother
as
they
sing
there
a
sweetness
most
appealing
in
the
trilling
of
their
notes
it
is
innocence
that
pouring
from
their
little
baby
throats
and
i
gaze
at
them
enraptured
for
my
a
real
thing
every
evening
when
the
kiddies
and
their
mother
start
to
sing
the
bumps
and
bruises
doctor
i
the
bumps
and
bruises
doctor
i
the
expert
that
they
seek
when
their
rough
and
tumble
playing
leaves
a
scar
on
leg
or
cheek
i
the
rapid
certain
curer
for
the
wounds
of
every
fall
i
the
pain
eradicator
i
can
always
heal
them
all
bumps
on
little
people
foreheads
i
can
quickly
smooth
away
i
take
splinters
out
of
fingers
without
very
much
delay
little
sorrows
i
can
banish
with
the
magic
of
my
touch
i
can
fix
a
bruise
that
dreadful
so
it
is
hurting
much
i
the
bumps
and
bruises
doctor
and
i
answer
every
call
and
my
fee
is
very
simple
just
a
kiss
and
that
is
all
and
i
sitting
here
and
wishing
in
the
years
that
are
to
be
when
they
face
life
real
troubles
that
they
bring
them
all
to
me
when
pa
counts
pa
not
so
very
big
or
brave
he
ca
lift
weights
like
uncle
jim
his
hands
are
soft
like
little
girls
most
anyone
could
wallop
him
ma
weighs
a
whole
lot
more
than
pa
when
they
go
swimming
she
could
stay
out
in
the
river
all
day
long
but
pa
gets
frozen
right
away
but
when
the
thunder
starts
to
roll
an
spits
ma
says
oh
dear
i
sure
we
all
of
us
be
killed
i
only
wish
your
pa
was
here
pa
cheeks
are
thin
an
kinder
pale
he
rough
it
worth
a
cent
he
could
stand
the
hike
we
had
the
day
the
boy
scouts
camping
went
he
has
to
hire
a
man
to
dig
the
garden
coz
his
back
gets
lame
an
he
be
crippled
for
a
week
if
he
should
play
a
baseball
game
but
when
a
thunder
storm
comes
up
ma
sits
shivers
in
the
gloam
an
every
time
the
thunder
rolls
she
says
i
wish
your
pa
was
home
i
do
know
just
what
pa
could
do
if
he
were
home
he
seems
so
frail
but
every
time
the
skies
grow
black
i
notice
ma
gets
rather
pale
an
when
she
called
us
children
in
an
locked
the
windows
an
the
doors
she
jumps
at
every
lightnin
flash
an
trembles
when
the
thunder
roars
an
when
the
baby
starts
to
cry
she
wrings
her
hands
an
says
oh
dear
it
terrible
it
terrible
i
only
wish
your
pa
was
here
peace
a
man
must
earn
his
hour
of
peace
must
pay
for
it
with
hours
of
strife
and
care
must
win
by
toil
the
evening
sweet
release
the
rest
that
may
be
portioned
for
his
share
the
idler
never
knows
it
never
can
peace
is
the
glory
ever
of
a
man
a
man
must
win
contentment
for
his
soul
must
battle
for
it
bravely
day
by
day
the
peace
he
seeks
is
not
a
goal
to
claim
it
he
must
tread
a
rugged
way
the
shirker
never
knows
a
tranquil
breast
peace
but
rewards
the
man
who
does
his
best
no
place
to
go
the
happiest
nights
i
ever
know
are
those
when
no
place
to
go
and
the
missus
says
when
the
day
is
through
we
a
thing
to
do
oh
the
joy
of
it
and
the
peace
untold
of
sitting
in
my
slippers
old
with
my
pipe
and
book
in
my
easy
chair
knowing
i
go
anywhere
need
hurry
my
evening
meal
nor
force
the
smiles
that
i
do
not
feel
but
can
grab
a
book
from
a
shelf
and
drop
all
sham
and
be
myself
oh
the
charm
of
it
and
the
comfort
rare
nothing
on
earth
with
it
can
compare
and
i
sorry
for
him
who
does
know
the
joy
of
having
no
place
to
go
defeat
no
one
is
beat
till
he
quits
no
one
is
through
till
he
stops
no
matter
how
hard
failure
hits
no
matter
how
often
he
drops
a
fellow
not
down
till
he
lies
in
the
dust
and
refuses
to
rise
fate
can
slam
him
and
bang
him
around
and
batter
his
frame
till
he
sore
but
she
never
can
say
that
he
downed
while
he
bobs
up
serenely
for
more
a
fellow
not
dead
till
he
dies
nor
beat
till
no
longer
he
tries
a
patriotic
wish
i
like
to
be
the
sort
of
man
the
flag
could
boast
about
i
like
to
be
the
sort
of
man
it
can
not
live
without
i
like
to
be
the
type
of
man
that
really
is
american
the
and
fellow
just
and
fair
that
all
men
picture
when
they
see
the
glorious
banner
of
the
free
i
like
to
be
the
sort
of
man
the
flag
now
typifies
the
kind
of
man
we
really
want
the
flag
to
symbolize
the
loyal
brother
to
a
trust
the
big
unselfish
soul
and
just
the
friend
of
every
man
oppressed
the
strong
support
of
all
that
best
the
sturdy
chap
the
banner
meant
it
flies
to
represent
i
like
to
be
the
sort
of
man
the
flag
supposed
to
mean
the
man
that
all
in
fancy
see
wherever
it
is
seen
the
chap
that
ready
for
a
fight
whenever
there
a
wrong
to
right
the
friend
in
every
time
of
need
the
doer
of
the
daring
deed
the
clean
and
generous
handed
man
that
is
a
real
american
the
price
of
joy
you
do
begrudge
the
labor
when
the
roses
start
to
bloom
you
do
recall
the
dreary
days
that
won
you
their
perfume
you
do
recall
a
single
care
you
spent
upon
the
garden
there
and
all
the
toil
of
tilling
soil
is
quite
forgot
the
day
the
first
pink
rosebuds
into
beauty
burst
you
do
begrudge
the
trials
grim
when
joy
has
come
to
you
you
do
recall
the
dreary
days
when
all
your
skies
are
blue
and
though
you
trod
a
weary
mile
the
ache
of
it
was
all
worth
while
and
all
the
stings
and
bitter
flings
are
wiped
away
upon
the
day
success
comes
dancing
down
the
way
the
things
that
make
a
soldier
great
the
things
that
make
a
soldier
great
and
send
him
out
to
die
to
face
the
flaming
cannon
mouth
nor
ever
question
why
are
lilacs
by
a
little
porch
the
row
of
tulips
red
the
peonies
and
pansies
too
the
old
petunia
bed
the
grass
plot
where
his
children
play
the
roses
on
the
wall
is
these
that
make
a
soldier
great
he
fighting
for
them
all
is
not
the
pomp
and
pride
of
kings
that
make
a
soldier
brave
is
not
allegiance
to
the
flag
that
over
him
may
wave
for
soldiers
never
fight
so
well
on
land
or
on
the
foam
as
when
behind
the
cause
they
see
the
little
place
called
home
endanger
but
that
humble
street
whereon
his
children
run
you
make
a
soldier
of
the
man
who
never
bore
a
gun
what
is
it
through
the
battle
smoke
the
valiant
solider
sees
the
little
garden
far
away
the
budding
apple
trees
the
little
patch
of
ground
back
there
the
children
at
their
play
perhaps
a
tiny
mound
behind
the
simple
church
of
gray
the
golden
thread
of
courage
is
linked
to
castle
dome
but
to
the
spot
it
be
the
humblest
spot
called
home
and
now
the
lilacs
bud
again
and
all
is
lovely
there
and
homesick
soldiers
far
away
know
spring
is
in
the
air
the
tulips
come
to
bloom
again
the
grass
once
more
is
green
and
every
man
can
see
the
spot
where
all
his
joys
have
been
he
sees
his
children
smile
at
him
he
hears
the
bugle
call
and
only
death
can
stop
him
now
he
fighting
for
them
all
the
joy
of
a
dog
ma
says
no
it
too
much
care
an
it
will
scatter
germs
an
hair
an
it
a
nuisance
through
and
through
an
barks
when
you
do
want
it
to
an
carries
dirt
from
off
the
street
an
tracks
the
carpets
with
its
feet
but
it
a
sign
he
growin
up
when
he
is
longin
for
a
pup
most
every
night
he
comes
to
me
an
climbs
of
my
knee
an
starts
to
fondle
me
an
pet
then
asks
me
if
i
found
one
yet
an
ma
says
now
do
tell
him
yes
you
know
they
make
an
awful
mess
an
starts
their
faults
to
catalogue
but
every
boy
should
have
a
dog
an
some
night
when
he
comes
to
me
deep
in
my
pocket
there
will
be
the
pup
he
hungry
to
possess
or
else
i
sadly
miss
my
guess
for
i
remember
all
the
joy
a
dog
meant
to
a
little
boy
who
loved
it
in
the
long
ago
the
joy
that
now
his
right
to
know
homesick
it
tough
when
you
are
homesick
in
a
strange
and
distant
place
it
anguish
when
you
hungry
for
an
face
and
yearning
for
the
good
folks
and
the
joys
you
used
to
know
when
you
miles
away
from
friendship
is
a
bitter
sort
of
woe
but
it
tougher
let
me
tell
you
and
a
stiffer
discipline
to
see
them
through
the
window
and
to
know
you
ca
go
in
oh
i
never
knew
the
meaning
of
that
red
sign
on
the
door
never
really
understood
it
never
thought
of
it
before
but
i
never
see
another
since
they
tacked
one
up
on
mine
but
i
think
about
the
father
that
is
barred
from
all
that
fine
and
i
think
about
the
mother
who
is
prisoner
in
there
so
her
little
son
or
daughter
shall
not
miss
a
mother
care
and
i
share
a
fellow
feeling
with
the
saddest
of
my
kin
the
dad
beside
the
gateway
of
the
home
he
ca
go
in
oh
we
laugh
and
joke
together
and
the
mother
tries
to
be
brave
and
sunny
in
her
prison
and
she
thinks
she
fooling
me
and
i
do
my
bravest
smiling
and
i
feign
a
merry
air
in
the
hope
she
wo
discover
that
burdened
down
with
care
but
it
only
empty
laughter
and
there
nothing
in
the
grin
when
you
talking
through
the
window
of
the
home
you
ca
go
in
the
perfect
dinner
table
a
table
cloth
that
slightly
soiled
where
greasy
little
hands
have
toiled
the
napkins
kept
in
silver
rings
and
only
ordinary
things
from
which
to
eat
a
simple
fare
and
just
the
wife
and
kiddies
there
and
while
i
serve
the
clatter
glad
of
little
girl
and
little
lad
who
have
so
very
much
to
say
about
the
happenings
of
the
day
four
big
round
eyes
that
dance
with
glee
forever
flashing
joys
at
me
two
little
tongues
that
race
and
run
to
tell
of
troubles
and
of
fun
the
mother
with
a
patient
smile
who
knows
that
she
must
wait
awhile
before
she
get
a
chance
to
say
what
she
discovered
through
the
day
she
steps
aside
for
girl
and
lad
who
have
so
much
to
tell
their
dad
our
manners
may
not
be
the
best
perhaps
our
elbows
often
rest
upon
the
table
and
at
times
that
very
worst
of
dinner
crimes
that
very
shameful
act
and
rude
of
speaking
ere
you
downed
your
food
too
frequently
i
fear
is
done
so
fast
the
little
voices
run
yet
why
should
table
manners
stay
those
tongues
that
have
so
much
to
say
at
many
a
table
i
have
been
where
wealth
and
luxury
were
seen
and
i
have
dined
in
halls
of
pride
where
all
the
guests
were
dignified
but
when
it
comes
to
pleasure
rare
the
perfect
dinner
table
where
no
stranger
face
is
ever
known
the
dinner
hour
we
spend
alone
when
little
girl
and
little
lad
run
riot
telling
things
to
dad
he
was
going
to
be
all
that
a
mortal
should
be
no
one
should
be
kinder
or
braver
than
he
a
friend
who
was
troubled
and
weary
he
knew
who
be
glad
of
a
lift
and
who
needed
it
too
on
him
he
would
call
and
see
what
he
could
do
each
morning
he
stacked
up
the
letters
write
and
thought
of
the
folks
he
would
fill
with
delight
it
was
too
bad
indeed
he
was
busy
and
had
a
minute
to
stop
on
his
way
more
time
he
would
have
to
give
others
say
the
greatest
of
workers
this
man
would
have
been
the
world
would
have
known
him
had
he
ever
seen
but
the
fact
is
he
died
and
he
faded
from
view
and
all
that
he
left
here
when
living
was
through
was
a
mountain
of
things
he
intended
to
do
a
prayer
god
grant
me
kindly
thought
and
patience
through
the
day
and
in
the
things
i
wrought
let
no
man
living
say
that
hate
grim
mark
has
stained
what
little
joy
i
gained
god
keep
my
nature
sweet
teach
me
to
bear
a
blow
disaster
and
defeat
and
no
resentment
show
if
failure
must
be
mine
sustain
this
soul
of
mine
god
grant
me
strength
to
face
undaunted
day
or
night
to
stoop
to
no
disgrace
to
win
my
little
fight
let
me
be
when
it
is
as
manly
as
before
to
the
lady
in
the
electric
lady
in
the
show
case
carriage
do
not
think
that
i
a
bear
not
for
worlds
would
i
disparage
one
so
gracious
and
so
fair
do
not
think
that
i
am
blind
to
one
who
has
a
smile
seraphic
you
i
never
be
unkind
to
but
you
are
impeding
traffic
if
i
had
some
way
of
knowing
what
you
are
about
to
do
just
exactly
where
you
going
if
i
could
depend
on
you
i
could
keep
my
engine
churning
travel
on
and
never
mind
you
lady
when
you
think
of
turning
why
not
signal
us
behind
you
lady
free
from
care
and
worry
riding
in
your
car
some
of
us
are
in
a
hurry
some
of
us
must
travel
far
i
myself
am
eager
very
to
be
journeying
on
my
way
lady
is
it
necessary
to
monopolize
the
highway
lady
at
the
handle
steering
why
not
keep
a
course
that
straight
know
you
not
that
wildly
veering
as
you
do
is
tempting
fate
do
not
think
my
horn
i
blowing
just
on
purpose
to
harass
you
it
is
just
a
signal
showing
that
i
safely
like
to
pass
you
lady
there
are
times
a
duty
must
be
done
however
saddening
it
is
hard
to
tell
a
beauty
that
she
very
often
maddening
and
i
would
not
now
be
saying
harsh
and
cruel
words
to
fuss
you
but
when
traffic
you
delaying
you
are
forcing
men
to
cuss
you
the
man
who
could
save
he
spent
what
he
made
or
he
gave
it
away
tried
to
save
money
and
would
for
a
day
started
a
time
an
again
got
a
hundred
or
so
for
a
nest
egg
an
then
some
fellow
that
needed
it
more
than
he
did
who
was
down
on
his
luck
with
a
sick
wife
or
kid
came
along
an
he
wasted
no
time
till
he
went
an
drew
out
the
coin
that
for
saving
was
meant
they
say
he
died
poor
and
i
guess
that
is
so
to
pile
up
a
fortune
he
had
a
show
he
worked
all
the
time
and
good
money
he
made
was
known
as
an
excellent
man
at
his
trade
but
he
saw
too
much
heard
too
much
felt
too
much
here
to
save
anything
by
the
end
of
the
year
an
the
shabbiest
wreck
the
lord
ever
let
live
could
get
money
from
him
if
he
had
it
to
give
i
seen
him
slip
dimes
to
the
bums
on
the
street
who
told
him
they
hungered
for
something
to
eat
an
though
i
remarked
they
were
going
for
drink
he
say
mebbe
so
but
i
just
hate
to
think
that
fellow
was
hungry
an
i
passed
him
by
i
rather
be
fooled
twenty
times
by
a
lie
than
wonder
if
one
of
i
would
feed
had
told
me
the
truth
an
was
really
in
need
never
stinted
his
family
out
of
a
thing
they
had
everything
that
his
money
could
bring
said
he
rather
be
broke
and
just
know
they
were
glad
than
rich
with
them
pining
an
wishing
they
had
some
of
the
pleasures
his
money
would
buy
said
he
never
could
look
a
bank
book
in
the
eye
if
he
knew
it
had
grown
on
the
pleasures
and
joys
that
he
robbed
from
his
wife
and
his
girls
and
his
boys
queer
sort
of
notion
he
had
i
confess
yet
many
a
rich
man
on
earth
is
mourned
less
all
who
had
known
him
came
back
to
his
side
to
honor
his
name
on
the
day
that
he
died
did
leave
much
in
the
bank
it
is
true
but
did
leave
a
fortune
in
people
who
knew
the
big
heart
of
him
an
i
willing
to
swear
that
he
is
one
of
the
richest
up
there
answering
him
when
shall
i
be
a
man
he
said
as
i
was
putting
him
to
bed
how
many
years
will
have
to
be
before
time
makes
a
man
of
me
and
will
i
be
a
man
when
i
am
grown
up
big
i
heaved
a
sigh
because
it
called
for
careful
thought
to
give
the
answer
that
he
sought
and
so
i
sat
him
on
my
knee
and
said
to
him
a
man
you
be
when
you
have
learned
that
honor
brings
more
joy
than
all
the
crowns
of
kings
that
it
is
better
to
be
true
to
all
who
know
and
trust
in
you
than
all
the
gold
of
earth
to
gain
if
winning
it
shall
leave
a
stain
when
you
can
fight
for
victory
sweet
yet
bravely
swallow
down
defeat
and
cling
to
hope
and
keep
the
right
nor
use
deceit
instead
of
might
when
you
are
kind
and
brave
and
clean
and
fair
to
all
and
never
mean
when
there
is
good
in
all
you
plan
that
day
my
boy
you
be
a
man
some
of
us
learn
this
truth
too
late
that
years
alone
ca
make
us
great
that
many
who
are
ten
have
fallen
short
of
being
men
because
in
selfishness
they
fought
and
toiled
without
refining
thought
and
whether
wrong
or
whether
right
they
lived
but
for
their
own
delight
when
you
have
learned
that
you
must
hold
your
honor
dearer
far
than
gold
that
no
wealth
or
fame
can
pay
you
for
your
tarnished
name
and
when
in
all
you
say
or
do
of
others
you
considerate
too
content
to
do
the
best
you
can
by
such
a
creed
you
be
a
man
father
and
son
be
more
than
his
dad
be
a
chum
to
the
lad
be
a
part
of
his
life
every
hour
of
the
day
find
time
to
talk
with
him
take
time
to
walk
with
him
share
in
his
studies
and
share
in
his
play
take
him
to
places
to
ball
games
and
races
teach
him
the
things
that
you
want
him
to
know
do
live
apart
from
him
do
keep
your
heart
from
him
be
his
best
comrade
he
needing
you
so
never
neglect
him
though
young
still
respect
him
hear
his
opinions
with
patience
and
pride
show
him
his
error
but
be
not
a
terror
and
fearful
when
he
at
your
side
know
what
his
thoughts
are
know
what
his
sports
are
know
all
his
playmates
it
easy
to
learn
to
be
such
a
father
that
when
troubles
gather
you
be
the
first
one
for
counsel
he
turn
to
you
can
inspire
him
with
courage
and
fire
him
hot
with
ambition
for
deeds
that
are
good
he
not
betray
you
nor
illy
repay
you
if
you
have
taught
him
the
things
that
you
should
father
and
son
must
in
all
things
be
one
partners
in
trouble
and
comrades
in
joy
more
than
a
dad
was
the
best
pal
you
had
be
such
a
chum
as
you
knew
to
your
boy
the
june
couple
she
is
fair
to
see
and
sweet
dainty
from
her
head
to
feet
modest
as
her
blushing
shows
happy
as
her
smiles
disclose
and
the
young
man
at
her
side
nervously
attempts
to
hide
underneath
a
visage
grim
that
the
fuss
is
bothering
him
pause
a
moment
happy
pair
this
is
not
the
station
where
romance
ends
and
wooing
stops
and
the
charm
from
courtship
drops
this
is
but
the
outward
gate
where
the
souls
of
mortals
mate
but
the
border
of
the
land
you
must
travel
hand
in
hand
you
who
come
to
marriage
bring
all
your
tenderness
and
cling
steadfastly
to
all
the
ways
that
have
marked
your
wooing
days
you
are
only
starting
out
on
life
roadways
hedged
about
thick
with
roses
and
with
tares
sweet
delights
and
bitter
cares
heretofore
you
only
played
at
love
game
young
man
and
maid
only
known
it
at
its
best
now
you
have
to
face
its
test
you
must
prove
your
love
worth
while
something
time
can
not
defile
something
neither
care
nor
pain
can
destroy
or
mar
or
stain
you
are
now
about
to
show
whether
love
is
real
or
no
yonder
down
the
lane
of
life
you
will
find
as
man
and
wife
sorrows
disappointments
doubt
hope
will
almost
flicker
out
but
if
rightly
you
are
wed
love
will
linger
where
you
tread
there
are
joys
that
you
will
share
joys
to
balance
every
care
arm
in
arm
remain
and
you
will
not
fear
the
storms
that
brew
if
when
you
are
sorest
tried
you
face
your
trials
side
by
side
now
your
wooing
days
are
done
and
your
loving
years
begun
at
the
door
he
wiped
his
shoes
before
his
door
but
ere
he
entered
he
did
more
was
not
enough
to
cleanse
his
feet
of
dirt
they
gathered
in
the
street
he
stood
and
dusted
off
his
mind
and
left
all
trace
of
care
behind
in
here
i
will
not
take
said
he
the
stains
the
day
has
brought
to
me
beyond
this
door
shall
never
go
the
burdens
that
are
mine
to
know
the
day
is
done
and
here
i
leave
the
petty
things
that
vex
and
grieve
what
clings
to
me
of
hate
and
sin
to
them
i
will
not
carry
in
only
the
good
shall
go
with
me
for
their
devoted
eyes
to
see
i
will
not
burden
them
with
cares
nor
track
the
home
with
grim
affairs
i
will
not
at
my
table
sit
with
soul
unclean
and
mind
unfit
beyond
this
door
i
will
not
take
the
outward
signs
of
inward
ache
i
will
not
take
a
dreary
mind
into
this
house
for
them
to
find
he
wiped
his
shoes
before
his
door
but
paused
to
do
a
little
more
he
dusted
off
the
stains
of
strife
the
mud
that
incident
to
life
the
blemishes
of
careless
thought
the
traces
of
the
fight
he
fought
the
selfish
humors
and
the
mean
and
when
he
entered
he
was
clean
duty
to
do
your
little
bit
of
toil
to
play
life
game
with
head
erect
to
stoop
to
nothing
that
would
soil
your
honor
or
your
to
win
what
gold
and
fame
you
can
but
first
of
all
to
be
a
man
to
know
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
the
sunshine
and
the
days
of
rain
to
meet
both
victory
and
defeat
nor
boast
too
loudly
nor
complain
to
face
whatever
fates
befall
and
be
a
man
throughout
it
all
to
seek
success
in
honest
strife
but
not
to
value
it
so
much
that
winning
it
you
go
through
life
stained
by
dishonor
scarlet
touch
what
goal
or
dream
you
choose
pursue
but
be
a
man
you
do
a
bear
story
there
was
a
bear
his
name
was
jim
an
children
were
askeered
of
him
an
he
lived
in
a
cave
where
he
was
confortubbul
as
could
be
an
in
that
cave
so
my
pa
said
jim
always
kept
a
stock
of
bread
an
honey
so
that
he
could
treat
the
boys
an
girls
along
his
street
an
all
that
jim
could
say
was
woof
an
give
a
grunt
that
went
like
soof
an
pa
says
when
his
grunt
went
off
it
sounded
jus
like
grandpa
cough
or
like
our
jerry
when
he
mad
an
growls
at
peddler
men
that
bad
while
were
afraid
of
jim
kids
could
do
anything
with
him
one
day
a
little
boy
like
me
that
had
a
sister
marjorie
was
walking
through
the
woods
an
they
heard
something
woofing
down
that
way
an
they
was
scared
an
stood
stock
still
an
wished
they
had
a
gun
to
kill
whatever
was
but
little
boys
do
have
no
guns
that
make
a
noise
an
soon
the
woofing
closer
grew
an
then
a
bear
came
into
view
the
biggest
bear
you
ever
saw
ma
muff
was
smaller
than
his
paw
he
saw
the
children
an
he
said
i
ai
to
kill
you
dead
you
need
turn
away
an
run
i
only
scarin
you
for
fun
an
then
he
stood
up
just
like
those
big
bears
in
circuses
an
shows
an
danced
a
jig
an
rolled
about
an
said
woof
woof
which
meant
look
out
an
turned
a
somersault
as
slick
as
any
boy
can
do
the
trick
those
children
had
been
told
of
jim
an
they
decided
it
was
him
they
stroked
his
nose
when
they
got
brave
an
followed
him
into
his
cave
an
jim
asked
them
if
they
liked
honey
they
said
they
did
said
jim
that
funny
i
asked
a
thousand
boys
or
so
that
question
an
not
one
said
no
what
happened
then
i
can
not
say
next
i
knew
was
light
as
day
autumn
at
the
orchard
the
sumac
flaming
scarlet
on
the
edges
o
the
lake
an
the
pear
trees
are
invitin
everyone
t
come
an
shake
now
the
gorgeous
tints
of
autumn
are
everywhere
till
it
seems
that
you
can
almost
see
the
master
painter
there
there
a
solemn
sort
o
stillness
that
every
thing
save
the
farewell
songs
to
summer
that
the
feathered
tenors
sing
an
you
quite
forget
the
city
where
disgruntled
folks
are
off
yonder
with
the
pelletiers
when
spies
are
ripe
for
pickin
the
holsteins
are
in
a
clearin
near
a
wood
very
dignified
an
stately
just
as
though
they
understood
that
they
lending
to
life
pictures
just
the
touch
the
master
needs
an
they
preachin
more
refinement
than
a
lot
o
printed
creeds
the
orchard
fairly
groanin
with
the
gifts
god
to
man
just
as
though
they
meant
to
shame
us
who
have
doubted
once
his
plan
oh
there
somethin
most
inspirin
to
a
soul
in
need
o
off
yonder
with
the
pelletiers
when
spies
are
ripe
fer
pickin
the
frisky
little
shetlands
now
are
shaggy
coats
an
acquirin
silken
mufflers
of
their
own
to
guard
their
throats
an
a
russian
puppy
left
its
mother
yesterday
an
a
tinge
o
sorrow
touched
us
as
we
saw
it
go
away
for
the
sight
was
full
o
meanin
an
we
knew
when
it
had
gone
was
a
symbol
of
the
partin
that
the
years
are
bringin
on
oh
a
feller
must
be
better
to
his
faith
he
help
off
yonder
with
the
pelletiers
when
spies
are
ripe
fer
pickin
the
year
is
almost
over
now
at
dusk
the
valleys
glow
with
the
misty
mantle
chillin
that
is
very
low
an
each
mornin
sees
the
maples
just
a
little
redder
turned
than
they
were
the
night
we
left
an
the
elms
are
browner
burned
an
a
feller
ca
help
feelin
an
i
do
care
who
it
is
that
the
mind
that
works
such
wonders
has
a
greater
power
than
his
oh
i
know
that
i
remember
till
life
last
few
sparks
are
the
lessons
out
at
pelletiers
when
spies
were
ripe
for
pickin
when
pa
comes
home
when
pa
comes
home
i
at
the
door
an
then
he
grabs
me
off
the
floor
an
throws
me
up
an
catches
me
when
i
come
down
an
then
says
he
well
how
you
get
along
an
were
you
good
an
did
you
play
an
keep
right
out
of
mamma
way
an
how
you
get
that
awful
bump
above
your
eye
my
what
a
lump
an

hat

a
chair

says

knocked
that
engine
on
its
back

stepped
upon
that
piece
of
track

on
his
knee
an
says

those
toys
upon
the
floor
an

those
things
behind
the
door
who
upset
all
those
parlor
chairs

those
blocks
upon
the
stairs

cyclone

was
workin
far
away

most

see

this
bump
the
time

tripped
an
here
is
where
the
jelly
slipped
right
off
my
bread
upon
my
shirt
an
when
me
tumbled
down
it
hurt
that
how
me
got
all
over
dirt

threw
those
building
blocks
downstairs
an
me
upset
the
parlor
chairs
coz
when
you
playin
train
you

an
awful
lot
an
then
my
pa
he
kisses
me
an
bounces
me
upon
his
knee
an
says
well
well
my
little
lad
what
glorious
fun
you
must
have
had
mother
day
gentle
hands
that
never
weary
toiling
in
vineyard
sweet
eyes
that
seem
forever
cheery
when
our
eyes
they
chance
to
meet
tender
patient
brave
devoted
this
is
always
mother
way
could
her
worth
in
gold
be
quoted
as
you
think
of
her
there
shall
never
be
another
quite
so
tender
quite
so
kind
as
the
patient
little
mother
nowhere
on
this
earth
you
find
her
affection
duplicated
none
so
proud
if
you
are
fine
could
her
worth
be
overstated
not
by
any
words
of
mine
death
stood
near
the
hour
she
bore
us
agony
was
hers
to
know
yet
she
bravely
faced
it
for
us
smiling
in
her
time
of
woe
down
the
years
how
oft
we
tried
her
often
selfish
heedless
blind
yet
with
love
alone
to
guide
her
she
was
never
once
unkind
vain
are
all
our
tributes
to
her
if
in
words
alone
they
dwell
we
must
live
the
praises
due
her
there
no
other
way
to
tell
gentle
mother
that
we
love
her
would
you
say
as
you
recall
all
the
patient
service
of
her
you
been
worthy
of
it
all
division
you
can
not
gather
every
rose
nor
every
pleasure
claim
nor
bask
in
every
breeze
that
blows
nor
play
in
every
game
no
millionaire
could
ever
own
the
world
supply
of
pearls
and
no
man
here
has
ever
known
all
of
the
pretty
girls
so
take
what
joy
may
come
your
way
and
envy
not
your
brothers
enjoy
your
share
of
fun
each
day
and
leave
the
rest
for
others
a
man
a
man
does
whine
at
his
losses
a
man
does
whimper
and
fret
or
rail
at
the
weight
of
his
crosses
and
ask
life
to
rear
him
a
pet
a
man
does
grudgingly
labor
or
look
upon
toil
as
a
blight
a
man
does
sneer
at
his
neighbor
or
sneak
from
a
cause
that
is
right
a
man
does
sulk
when
another
succeeds
where
his
efforts
have
failed
does
keep
all
his
praise
for
the
brother
whose
glory
is
publicly
hailed
and
pass
by
the
weak
and
the
humble
as
though
they
were
not
of
his
clay
a
man
does
ceaselessly
grumble
when
things
are
not
going
his
way
a
man
looks
on
woman
as
tender
and
gentle
and
stands
at
her
side
at
all
times
to
guard
and
defend
her
and
never
to
scorn
or
deride
a
man
looks
on
life
as
a
mission
to
serve
just
so
far
as
he
can
a
man
holds
his
noblest
ambition
on
earth
is
to
live
as
a
man
a
vow
i
might
not
ever
scale
the
mountain
heights
where
all
the
great
men
stand
in
glory
now
i
may
not
ever
gain
the
world
delights
or
win
a
wreath
of
laurel
for
my
brow
i
may
not
gain
the
victories
that
men
are
fighting
for
nor
do
a
thing
to
boast
of
i
may
not
get
a
fortune
here
but
then
the
little
that
i
have
i
make
the
most
of
i
make
my
little
home
a
palace
fine
my
little
patch
of
green
a
garden
fair
and
i
shall
know
each
humble
plant
and
vine
as
rich
men
know
their
orchid
blossoms
rare
my
little
home
may
not
be
much
to
see
its
chimneys
may
not
tower
far
above
but
it
will
be
a
mansion
great
to
me
for
in
its
walls
i
keep
a
hoard
of
love
i
will
not
pass
my
modest
pleasures
by
to
grasp
at
shadows
of
more
splendid
things
disdaining
what
of
joyousness
is
nigh
because
i
am
denied
the
joy
of
kings
but
i
will
laugh
and
sing
my
way
along
i
make
the
most
of
what
is
mine
and
if
i
never
rise
above
the
throng
i
shall
have
lived
a
full
life
anyway
treasures
some
folks
i
know
when
friends
drop
in
to
visit
for
awhile
and
chin
just
lead
them
round
the
rooms
and
halls
and
show
them
pictures
on
their
walls
and
point
to
rugs
and
tapestries
the
works
of
men
across
the
seas
their
loving
cups
they
show
with
pride
to
eyes
that
soon
are
stretching
wide
with
wonder
at
the
treasures
rare
that
have
been
bought
and
gathered
there
but
when
folks
come
to
call
on
me
i
no
such
things
for
them
to
see
no
picture
on
my
walls
is
great
i
have
no
ancient
family
plate
no
tapestry
of
rare
design
or
costly
woven
rugs
are
mine
i
have
no
loving
cup
to
show
or
strange
and
valued
curio
but
if
my
treasures
they
would
see
i
bid
them
softly
follow
me
and
then
i
lead
them
up
the
stairs
through
trains
of
cars
and
teddy
bears
and
to
a
little
room
we
creep
where
both
my
youngsters
lie
asleep
close
locked
in
one
another
arms
i
let
them
gaze
upon
their
charms
i
let
them
see
the
legs
of
brown
curled
up
beneath
a
sleeping
gown
and
whisper
in
my
happiness
behold
the
treasures
i
possess
challenge
life
is
a
challenge
to
the
bold
it
flings
its
gauntlet
down
and
bids
us
if
we
seek
for
gold
and
glory
and
renown
to
come
and
them
from
its
store
it
will
not
meekly
hand
them
life
is
a
challenge
all
must
meet
and
nobly
must
we
dare
its
gold
is
tawdry
when
we
cheat
its
fame
a
bitter
snare
if
it
be
stolen
from
life
clutch
men
must
be
true
to
prosper
much
life
is
a
challenge
and
its
laws
are
rigid
ones
and
stern
the
splendid
joy
of
real
applause
each
man
must
nobly
earn
it
makes
us
win
its
jewels
rare
but
gives
us
paste
if
we
unfair
a
toast
to
happiness
to
happiness
i
raise
my
glass
the
goal
of
every
human
the
hope
of
every
clan
and
class
and
every
man
and
woman
the
daydreams
of
the
urchin
there
the
sweet
theme
of
the
maiden
prayer
the
strong
man
one
ambition
the
sacred
prize
of
mothers
sweet
the
tramp
of
soldiers
on
the
street
have
all
the
selfsame
mission
life
here
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
just
a
quest
for
happiness
some
seek
it
on
the
mountain
top
and
some
within
a
mine
the
widow
in
her
notion
shop
expects
its
sun
to
shine
the
tramp
that
seeks
new
roads
to
fare
is
one
with
king
and
millionaire
in
this
that
each
is
groping
on
different
roads
in
different
ways
to
come
to
glad
contented
days
and
shares
the
common
hoping
the
sound
of
martial
fife
and
drum
is
born
of
happiness
to
come
yet
happiness
is
always
here
had
we
the
eyes
to
see
it
no
breast
but
holds
a
fund
of
cheer
had
man
the
will
to
free
it
is
there
upon
the
mountain
top
or
in
the
widow
notion
shop
is
found
in
homes
of
sorrow
is
woven
in
the
memories
of
happier
brighter
days
than
these
the
gift
not
of
but
of
and
in
our
tears
some
touch
of
happiness
appears
is
not
a
joy
that
born
of
wealth
the
poor
man
may
possess
it
is
not
alone
the
prize
of
health
no
sickness
can
repress
it
is
not
the
end
of
mortal
strife
the
sunset
of
the
day
of
life
or
but
the
old
should
find
it
it
is
the
bond
twixt
god
and
man
the
touch
divine
in
all
we
plan
and
has
the
soul
behind
it
and
so
this
toast
to
happiness
the
seed
of
which
we
all
possess
guessing
time
it
guessing
time
at
our
house
every
evening
after
tea
we
start
guessing
what
old
santa
going
to
leave
us
on
our
tree
everyone
of
us
holds
secrets
that
the
others
try
to
steal
and
that
eyes
and
lips
are
plainly
having
trouble
to
conceal
and
a
little
lip
that
quivered
just
a
bit
the
other
night
was
a
sad
and
startling
warning
that
i
guess
it
right
guess
what
you
will
get
for
christmas
is
the
cry
that
starts
the
fun
and
i
answer
give
the
letter
with
which
the
name
begun
oh
the
eyes
that
dance
around
me
and
the
joyous
faces
there
keep
me
nightly
guessing
wildly
is
it
something
i
can
wear
i
implore
them
all
to
tell
me
in
a
frantic
sort
of
way
and
pretend
that
i
am
puzzled
just
to
keep
them
feeling
gay
oh
the
wise
and
knowing
glances
that
across
the
table
fly
and
the
winks
exchanged
with
mother
that
they
think
i
never
spy
oh
the
whispered
confidences
that
are
poured
into
her
ear
and
the
laughter
gay
that
follows
when
i
try
my
best
to
hear
oh
the
shouts
of
glad
derision
when
i
bet
that
it
a
cane
and
the
merry
answering
chorus
no
not
just
guess
again
it
guessing
time
at
our
house
and
the
fun
is
running
fast
and
i
wish
somehow
this
contest
of
delight
could
always
last
for
the
love
that
in
their
faces
and
their
laughter
ringing
clear
is
their
dad
most
precious
present
when
the
christmas
time
is
near
and
soon
as
it
is
over
when
the
tree
is
bare
and
plain
i
shall
start
in
looking
forward
to
the
time
to
guess
again
understanding
when
i
was
young
and
frivolous
and
never
stopped
to
think
when
i
was
always
doing
wrong
or
just
upon
the
brink
when
i
was
just
a
lad
of
seven
and
eight
and
nine
and
ten
it
seemed
to
me
that
every
day
i
got
in
trouble
then
and
strangers
used
to
shake
their
heads
and
say
i
was
no
good
but
father
always
stuck
to
me
it
seems
he
understood
i
used
to
have
to
go
to
him
every
night
and
say
the
dreadful
things
that
i
had
done
to
worry
folks
that
day
i
know
i
did
mean
to
be
a
turmoil
round
the
place
and
with
the
womenfolks
about
forever
in
disgrace
to
do
the
way
they
said
i
should
i
tried
the
best
i
could
but
though
they
scolded
me
a
lot
my
father
understood
he
never
seemed
to
think
it
queer
that
i
should
risk
my
bones
or
fight
with
other
boys
at
times
or
pelt
a
cat
with
stones
an
when
i
break
a
window
pane
it
used
to
make
him
sad
but
though
the
neighbors
said
i
was
he
never
thought
me
bad
he
never
whipped
me
as
they
used
to
say
to
me
he
should
that
boys
ca
always
do
what
right
it
seemed
he
understood
now
there
that
little
chap
of
mine
just
full
of
life
and
fun
comes
up
to
me
with
solemn
face
to
tell
the
bad
he
done
it
natural
for
any
boy
to
be
a
roguish
elf
he
has
time
to
stop
and
think
and
figure
for
himself
and
though
the
womenfolks
insist
that
i
should
take
a
hand
they
never
been
a
boy
themselves
and
they
do
understand
some
day
i
got
to
go
up
there
and
make
a
sad
report
and
tell
the
father
of
us
all
where
i
have
fallen
short
and
there
will
be
a
lot
of
wrong
i
never
meant
to
do
a
lot
of
smudges
on
my
sheet
that
he
will
have
to
view
and
little
chance
for
heavenly
bliss
up
there
will
i
command
unless
the
father
smiles
and
says
my
boy
i
understand
people
liked
him
people
liked
him
not
because
he
was
rich
or
known
to
fame
he
had
never
won
applause
as
a
star
in
any
game
his
was
not
a
brilliant
style
his
was
not
a
forceful
way
but
he
had
a
gentle
smile
and
a
kindly
word
to
say
never
arrogant
or
proud
on
he
went
with
manner
mild
never
quarrelsome
or
loud
just
as
simple
as
a
child
honest
patient
brave
and
true
thus
he
lived
from
day
to
day
doing
what
he
found
to
do
in
a
cheerful
sort
of
way
was
one
to
boast
of
gold
or
belittle
it
with
sneers
did
change
from
hot
to
cold
kept
his
friends
throughout
the
years
sort
of
man
you
like
to
meet
any
time
or
any
place
there
was
always
something
sweet
and
refreshing
in
his
face
sort
of
man
you
like
to
be
balanced
well
and
truly
square
patient
in
adversity
generous
when
his
skies
were
fair
never
lied
to
friend
or
foe
never
rash
in
word
or
deed
quick
to
come
and
slow
to
go
in
a
neighbor
time
of
need
never
rose
to
wealth
or
fame
simply
lived
and
simply
died
but
the
passing
of
his
name
left
a
sorrow
far
and
wide
not
for
glory
he
attained
nor
for
what
he
had
of
pelf
were
the
friends
that
he
had
gained
but
for
what
he
was
himself
when
father
shook
the
stove
was
not
so
many
years
ago
say
or
three
when
zero
weather
or
below
held
many
a
thrill
for
me
then
in
my
icy
room
i
slept
a
youngster
sweet
repose
and
always
on
my
form
i
kept
my
flannel
underclothes
then
i
was
roused
by
sudden
shock
though
still
to
sleep
i
strove
i
knew
that
it
was
seven
when
father
shook
the
stove
i
never
heard
him
quit
his
bed
or
his
alarm
clock
ring
i
never
heard
his
gentle
tread
or
his
attempts
to
sing
the
sun
that
found
my
window
pane
on
me
was
wholly
lost
though
many
a
sunbeam
tried
in
vain
to
penetrate
the
frost
to
human
voice
i
never
stirred
but
deeper
down
i
dove
beneath
the
covers
when
i
heard
my
father
shake
the
stove
it
all
comes
back
to
me
and
i
can
hear
it
still
he
seemed
to
take
a
special
glee
in
shaking
with
a
will
he
flung
the
noisy
dampers
back
then
rattled
steel
on
steel
until
the
force
of
his
attack
the
building
seemed
to
feel
though
i
a
youngster
heavy
eyes
all
sleep
from
them
he
drove
it
seemed
to
me
the
dead
must
rise
when
father
shook
the
stove
now
radiators
thump
and
pound
and
every
room
is
warm
and
modern
men
new
ways
have
found
to
shield
us
from
the
storm
the
window
panes
are
seldom
glossed
the
way
they
used
to
be
the
pictures
left
by
old
jack
frost
our
children
never
see
and
now
that
he
has
gone
to
rest
in
god
great
slumber
grove
i
often
think
those
days
were
best
when
father
shook
the
stove
time
was
when
spring
returned
we
went
to
find
another
home
to
rent
we
wanted
fresher
cleaner
walls
and
bigger
rooms
and
wider
halls
and
open
plumbing
and
the
dome
that
made
the
fashionable
home
but
now
with
spring
we
want
to
sell
and
seek
a
finer
place
to
dwell
our
thoughts
have
turned
from
dens
and
domes
we
want
the
latest
thing
in
homes
to
life
we
not
be
reconciled
until
we
have
a
bathroom
tiled
a
butler
pantry
we
desire
although
no
butler
do
we
hire
nell
life
will
be
one
round
of
gloom
without
a
closet
for
the
broom
and
mine
will
dreary
be
and
sour
unless
the
bathroom
has
a
shower
for
months
and
months
we
sat
and
dreamed
of
paneled
walls
and
ceilings
beamed
and
cases
for
the
books
an
attic
room
to
be
the
cook
no
house
will
she
consent
to
view
unless
it
has
a
sun
room
too
there
must
be
wash
bowls
here
and
there
to
save
much
climbing
of
the
stair
a
sleeping
porch
we
both
demand
this
fad
has
swept
throughout
the
land
and
oh
give
her
heart
a
wrench
not
to
possess
a
few
doors
french
i
want
to
dig
and
walk
around
at
least
full
fifty
feet
of
ground
she
wants
the
latest
style
in
tubs
i
want
more
room
for
trees
and
shrubs
and
a
garage
with
light
and
heat
that
can
be
entered
from
the
street
the
trouble
is
the
things
we
seek
can
not
be
bought
for
and
all
the
joys
for
which
we
sigh
are
just
too
rich
for
us
to
buy
we
have
the
taste
to
cut
a
dash
the
thing
we
lacking
most
is
cash
an
easy
world
it
an
easy
world
to
live
in
if
you
choose
to
make
it
so
you
never
need
to
suffer
save
the
griefs
that
all
must
know
if
you
stay
upon
the
level
and
will
do
the
best
you
can
you
will
never
lack
the
friendship
of
a
kindly
fellow
man
life
an
easy
road
to
travel
if
you
only
walk
it
straight
when
the
clouds
begin
to
gather
and
your
hopes
begin
to
fade
if
you
only
toiled
in
honor
you
wo
have
to
call
for
aid
but
if
you
bartered
friendship
and
the
faith
on
which
it
rests
for
a
temporary
winning
if
you
cheated
in
the
tests
if
with
promises
you
broken
you
have
chilled
the
hearts
of
men
it
is
vain
to
look
for
friendship
for
it
will
not
come
again
oh
the
world
is
full
of
kindness
thronged
with
men
who
want
to
be
of
some
service
to
their
neighbors
and
run
to
you
or
me
when
we
needing
their
assistance
if
lived
upon
the
square
but
they
spurn
us
in
our
trouble
if
always
been
unfair
it
an
easy
world
to
live
in
all
you
really
need
to
do
is
the
decent
thing
and
proper
and
then
friends
will
flock
to
you
but
let
dishonor
trail
you
and
some
stormy
day
you
find
to
your
heart
supremest
sorrow
that
made
the
world
unkind
the
states
there
is
no
star
within
the
flag
that
brighter
than
its
brothers
and
when
of
michigan
i
brag
i
boasting
of
the
others
just
which
is
which
no
man
can
say
one
star
for
every
state
gleams
brightly
on
our
flag
and
every
one
is
great
the
stars
that
gem
the
skies
at
night
may
differ
in
degree
and
some
are
pale
and
some
are
bright
but
in
our
flag
we
see
a
sky
of
blue
wherein
the
stars
are
equal
in
design
each
has
the
radiance
of
mars
and
all
are
yours
and
mine
the
glory
that
is
is
colorado
too
the
same
sky
minnesota
spans
the
same
sun
warms
it
through
and
all
are
one
beneath
the
flag
a
common
hope
is
ours
our
country
is
the
mountain
crag
the
valley
and
its
flowers
the
land
we
love
lies
far
away
as
well
as
close
at
hand
he
has
no
vision
who
would
say
state
my
native
land
though
sweet
the
charms
he
knows
the
best
deep
down
within
his
heart
the
farthest
east
the
farthest
west
of
him
must
be
a
part
there
is
no
star
within
the
flag
that
brighter
than
its
brothers
so
when
of
michigan
i
brag
i
boasting
of
the
others
we
share
alike
one
purpose
true
one
common
end
awaits
we
must
in
all
we
dream
or
do
remain
states
the
obligation
of
friendship
you
ought
to
be
fine
for
the
sake
of
the
folks
who
think
you
are
fine
if
others
have
faith
in
you
doubly
you
bound
to
stick
to
the
line
it
not
only
on
you
that
dishonor
descends
you
ca
hurt
yourself
without
hurting
your
friends
you
ought
to
be
true
for
the
sake
of
the
folks
who
believe
you
are
true
you
never
should
stoop
to
a
deed
that
your
friends
think
you
would
do
if
you
false
to
yourself
be
the
blemish
but
small
you
have
injured
your
friends
you
been
false
to
them
all
for
friendship
my
boy
is
a
bond
between
men
that
is
founded
on
truth
it
believes
in
the
best
of
the
ones
that
it
loves
whether
old
man
or
youth
and
the
stern
rule
it
lays
down
for
me
and
for
you
is
to
be
what
our
friends
think
we
are
through
and
through
under
the
skin
of
men
did
you
ever
sit
down
and
talk
with
men
in
a
serious
sort
of
a
way
on
their
views
of
life
and
ponder
then
on
all
that
they
have
to
say
if
not
you
should
in
some
quiet
hour
it
a
glorious
thing
to
do
for
you
find
that
back
of
the
pomp
and
power
most
men
have
a
goal
in
view
they
tell
you
then
that
their
aim
is
not
the
clink
of
the
yellow
gold
that
not
in
the
worldly
things
they
got
would
they
have
their
stories
told
they
say
the
joys
that
they
treasure
most
are
their
good
friends
tried
and
true
and
an
honest
name
for
their
own
to
boast
and
peace
when
the
day
is
through
i
talked
with
men
and
i
think
i
know
what
under
the
toughened
skin
i
seen
their
eyes
grow
bright
and
glow
with
the
fire
that
burns
within
and
back
of
the
gold
and
back
of
the
fame
and
back
of
the
selfish
strife
in
most
men
breasts
you
find
the
flame
of
the
nobler
things
of
life
the
finer
thought
how
fine
it
is
at
night
to
say
i
have
not
wronged
a
soul
i
have
not
by
a
word
or
deed
in
any
breast
sowed
anger
seed
or
caused
a
fellow
being
pain
nor
is
there
on
my
crest
a
stain
that
shame
has
left
in
honor
way
with
head
erect
i
lived
this
day
when
night
slips
down
and
day
departs
and
rest
returns
to
weary
hearts
how
fine
it
is
to
close
the
book
of
records
for
the
day
and
look
once
more
along
the
traveled
mile
and
find
that
all
has
been
worth
while
to
say
in
honor
i
have
toiled
my
plume
is
spotless
and
unsoiled
yet
cold
and
stern
a
man
may
be
retaining
his
integrity
and
he
may
pass
from
day
to
day
a
spirit
dead
in
living
clay
observing
strictly
morals
laws
yet
serving
but
a
selfish
cause
so
it
is
not
enough
to
say
i
have
not
stooped
to
shame
it
is
a
finer
nobler
thought
when
day
is
done
and
night
has
brought
the
contemplative
hours
and
sweet
and
rest
to
weary
hearts
and
feet
if
man
can
stand
in
truth
and
say
i
have
been
useful
here
back
there
is
one
i
chanced
to
see
with
hope
newborn
because
of
me
this
day
in
honor
i
have
toiled
my
shining
crest
is
still
unsoiled
but
on
the
mile
i
leave
behind
is
one
who
says
that
i
was
kind
and
someone
hums
a
cheerful
song
because
i
chanced
to
come
along
sweet
rest
at
night
that
man
shall
own
who
has
not
lived
his
day
alone
stuck
i
up
against
it
day
by
day
my
ignorance
is
distressing
the
things
i
do
know
on
the
way
i
busily
confessing
time
was
i
used
to
think
i
knew
some
useful
bits
of
knowledge
and
could
be
sure
of
one
or
two
real
facts
i
gleaned
in
college
but
i
unfitted
for
the
task
of
answering
things
my
boy
can
ask
now
who
can
answer
queries
queer
that
can
think
up
and
tell
in
simple
phrase
and
clear
why
fishes
do
not
drink
up
the
water
in
the
streams
and
lakes
or
where
the
wind
is
going
and
tell
exactly
how
god
makes
the
roses
that
are
growing
i
sure
i
can
not
satisfy
each
little
when
and
how
and
why
had
i
the
wisdom
of
a
sage
possessed
of
all
the
learning
that
can
be
gleaned
from
printed
page
from
bookworm
closest
turning
that
eager
lad
that
questions
me
so
gayly
could
still
go
round
and
boast
he
had
with
queries
floored
me
daily
he
stick
i
bet
in
less
than
five
brief
minutes
any
man
alive
eternal
friendship
who
once
has
had
a
friend
has
found
the
link
mortal
and
divine
though
now
he
sleeps
in
hallowed
ground
he
lives
in
memory
sacred
shrine
and
there
he
freely
moves
about
a
spirit
that
has
quit
the
clay
and
in
the
times
of
stress
and
doubt
sustains
his
friend
throughout
the
day
no
friend
we
love
can
ever
die
the
outward
form
but
disappears
i
know
that
all
my
friends
are
nigh
whenever
i
am
moved
to
tears
and
when
my
strength
and
hope
are
gone
the
friends
no
more
that
once
i
knew
return
to
cheer
and
urge
me
on
just
as
they
always
used
to
do
they
whisper
to
me
in
the
dark
kind
words
of
counsel
and
of
cheer
when
hope
has
flickered
to
a
spark
i
feel
their
gentle
spirits
near
and
oh
because
of
them
i
strive
with
all
the
strength
that
i
can
call
to
keep
their
friendship
still
alive
and
to
be
worthy
of
them
all
death
does
not
end
our
friendships
true
we
all
are
debtors
to
the
dead
there
wait
on
everything
we
do
the
splendid
souls
who
gone
ahead
to
them
i
hold
that
we
are
bound
by
double
pledges
to
be
fine
who
once
has
had
a
friend
has
found
the
link
mortal
and
divine
faith
i
believe
in
the
world
and
its
bigness
and
splendor
that
most
of
the
hearts
beating
round
us
are
tender
that
days
are
but
footsteps
and
years
are
but
miles
that
lead
us
to
beauty
and
singing
and
smiles
that
roses
that
blossom
and
toilers
that
plod
are
filled
with
the
glorious
spirit
of
god
i
believe
in
the
purpose
of
everything
living
that
taking
is
but
the
forerunner
of
giving
that
strangers
are
friends
that
we
some
day
may
meet
and
not
all
the
bitter
can
equal
the
sweet
that
creeds
are
but
colors
and
no
man
has
said
that
god
loves
the
yellow
rose
more
than
the
red
i
believe
in
the
path
that
i
am
treading
that
i
shall
come
safe
through
the
dangers
i
dreading
that
even
the
scoffer
shall
turn
from
his
ways
and
some
day
be
won
back
to
trust
and
to
praise
that
the
leaf
on
the
tree
and
the
thing
we
call
man
are
sharing
alike
in
his
infinite
plan
i
believe
that
all
things
that
are
living
and
breathing
some
richness
of
beauty
to
earth
are
bequeathing
that
all
that
goes
out
of
this
world
leaves
behind
some
duty
accomplished
for
mortals
to
find
that
the
humblest
of
creatures
our
praise
is
deserving
for
it
with
the
wisest
the
master
is
serving
i
nobody
hates
me
more
than
i
no
enemy
have
i
that
i
so
bravely
must
defy
there
are
no
foes
along
my
way
however
bitter
they
may
be
so
powerful
to
injure
me
as
i
am
nor
as
quick
to
spoil
the
beauty
of
my
bit
of
toil
nobody
harms
me
more
than
i
no
one
is
meaner
unto
me
of
all
the
foes
that
pass
me
by
i
am
the
worst
one
that
i
see
i
am
the
dangerous
man
to
fear
i
am
the
cause
of
sorrow
here
of
all
men
my
hopes
inclined
i
am
myself
the
most
unkind
i
do
more
harmful
things
to
me
than
all
the
men
who
seem
to
hate
i
am
the
fellow
that
should
be
more
dreaded
than
the
works
of
fate
i
am
the
one
that
i
must
fight
with
all
my
will
and
all
my
might
my
foes
are
better
friends
to
me
than
i
have
ever
proved
to
be
i
am
the
careless
foe
and
mean
i
am
the
selfish
rival
too
my
enmity
to
me
is
seen
in
almost
everything
i
do
more
courage
it
requires
to
beat
myself
than
all
the
foes
i
meet
i
am
more
traitorous
to
me
than
other
men
could
ever
be
in
every
struggle
i
have
lost
i
am
the
one
that
was
to
blame
my
weaknesses
can
not
be
glossed
by
glib
excuses
i
was
lame
i
that
would
dare
for
fame
or
pelf
am
far
less
daring
with
myself
i
care
not
who
my
foes
may
be
i
am
my
own
worst
enemy
the
things
that

the

he
ventured

dangers
new
and
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
jeering
throng
or
the
fears
of
the

the

follow

go
on

i
wish
his

take

i
waste

vague

nor

revenge

for
him
i
would
bespeak
i
wish
his

and
little
one
might
leave
him
for

i
wish
him
all
the
loneliness
that
comes
with
loss
of
those
who
fill
his
life
with
laughter
and
contentment
and
repose
i
wish
him
empty
rooms
at
night
and
mocking
stairs
to
squeak
that
neither
wife
nor
little

will
greet
him
for

the
day
is
always
at
its
post
to
see
new
ways
of
help
and
use
to
be
merit
from
duty
never
slinks
its
cardinal
virtue
is
it
thinks
promotion
comes
to
him
who
tries
not
solely
for
a
selfish
prize
but
day
by
day
and
year
by
year
holds
his
employer
interests
dear
who
measures
not
by
what
he
earns
the
sum
of
labor
he
returns
nor
counts
his
day
of
toiling
through
till
he
done
all
that
he
can
do
his
strength
is
not
of
muscle
bred
but
of
the
heart
and
of
the
head
the
man
who
would
the
top
attain
must
demonstrate
he
has
a
brain
expectation
most
folks
as
i
noticed
in
pleasure
an
strife
are
always
expecting
too
much
out
of
life
they
wail
an
they
fret
just
because
they
do
get
the
best
o
the
sunshine
the
fairest
o
flowers
the
finest
o
features
the
strongest
o
powers
they
whine
an
they
whimper
an
curse
an
condemn
coz
life
is
always
being
partial
to
them
notwithstandin
the
pain
an
the
sufferin
they
see
they
cling
to
the
notion
that
they
should
go
free
that
they
should
share
in
life
trouble
an
care
but
should
always
be
happy
an
never
perplexed
an
never
discouraged
or
beaten
or
vexed
when
life
treats
roughly
an
jolts
with
care
they
seem
to
imagine
it
bein
unfair
it
a
curious
notion
folks
hold
in
their
pride
that
their
souls
should
never
be
tested
or
tried
that
others
must
mourn
an
be
sick
an
forlorn
an
stand
by
the
biers
of
their
loved
ones
an
weep
but
life
from
such
sorrows
their
bosoms
must
keep
oh
they
must
know
what
it
means
to
be
sad
or
they
wail
that
the
treatment
they
is
bad
now
life
as
i
view
it
means
pleasure
an
pain
an
laughter
an
weepin
an
sunshine
an
rain
an
takin
an
givin
an
all
who
are
must
face
it
an
bear
it
the
best
that
they
can
believin
great
wisdom
is
workin
the
plan
an
no
one
should
ever
complain
it
unfair
because
at
the
moment
he
tastin
despair
hard
work
one
day
in
ages
dark
and
dim
a
toiler
weary
worn
and
faint
who
found
his
task
too
much
for
him
gave
voice
unto
a
sad
complaint
and
seeking
emphasis
to
give
unto
his
trials
coupled
to
work
this
adjective
this
little
word
of
terror
and
from
that
day
to
this
has
work
its
frightening
description
worn
is
spoken
daily
by
the
shirk
the
first
cloud
on
the
sky
at
morn
when
there
are
tasks
to
do
save
that
we
keep
ourselves
on
guard
with
fearful
doubtings
them
we
view
and
think
and
speak
of
them
as
hard
that
little
but
word
has
wrought
great
havoc
with
men
souls
has
chilled
the
hearts
ambition
stirred
and
held
the
pass
to
splendid
goals
great
dreams
have
faded
and
been
lost
fine
youth
by
it
been
sadly
marred
as
plants
beneath
a
withering
frost
because
men
thought
and
whispered
hard
let
think
of
work
in
terms
of
hope
and
speak
of
it
with
words
of
praise
and
tell
the
joy
it
is
to
grope
along
the
new
untrodden
ways
let
break
this
habit
of
despair
and
cheerfully
our
task
regard
the
road
to
happiness
lies
there
why
think
or
speak
of
it
as
hard
gratitude
be
grateful
for
the
kindly
friends
that
walk
along
your
way
be
grateful
for
the
skies
of
blue
that
smile
from
day
to
day
be
grateful
for
the
health
you
own
the
work
you
find
to
do
for
round
about
you
there
are
men
less
fortunate
than
you
be
grateful
for
the
growing
trees
the
roses
soon
to
bloom
the
tenderness
of
kindly
hearts
that
shared
your
days
of
gloom
be
grateful
for
the
morning
dew
the
grass
beneath
your
feet
the
soft
caresses
of
your
babes
and
all
their
laughter
sweet
acquire
the
grateful
habit
learn
to
see
how
blest
you
are
how
much
there
is
to
gladden
life
how
little
life
to
mar
and
what
if
rain
shall
fall
and
you
with
grief
are
sad
be
grateful
that
you
can
recall
the
joys
that
you
have
had
a
real
man
men
are
of
two
kinds
and
he
was
of
the
kind
i
like
to
be
some
preach
their
virtues
and
a
few
express
their
lives
by
what
they
do
that
sort
was
he
no
flowery
phrase
or
glibly
spoken
words
of
praise
won
friends
for
him
he
was
cheap
or
shallow
but
his
course
ran
deep
and
it
was
pure
you
know
the
kind
not
many
in
a
life
you
find
whose
deeds
outrun
their
words
so
far
that
more
than
what
they
seem
they
are
there
are
two
kinds
of
lies
as
well
the
kind
you
live
the
ones
you
tell
back
through
his
years
from
age
to
youth
he
never
acted
one
untruth
out
in
the
open
light
he
fought
and
did
care
what
others
thought
nor
what
they
said
about
his
fight
if
he
believed
that
he
was
right
the
only
deeds
he
ever
hid
were
acts
of
kindness
that
he
did
what
speech
he
had
was
plain
and
blunt
his
was
an
unattractive
front
yet
children
loved
him
babe
and
boy
played
with
the
strength
he
could
employ
without
one
fear
and
they
are
fleet
to
sense
injustice
and
deceit
no
back
door
gossip
linked
his
name
with
any
shady
tale
of
shame
he
did
not
have
to
compromise
with
shrewd
and
wise
and
let
them
ply
their
vicious
trade
because
of
some
past
escapade
men
are
of
two
kinds
and
he
was
of
the
kind
i
like
to
be
no
door
at
which
he
ever
knocked
against
his
manly
form
was
locked
if
ever
man
on
earth
was
free
and
independent
it
was
he
no
broken
pledge
lost
him
respect
he
met
all
men
with
head
erect
and
when
he
passed
i
think
there
went
a
soul
to
yonder
firmament
so
white
so
splendid
and
so
fine
it
came
almost
to
god
design
the
neighborly
man
some
are
eager
to
be
famous
some
are
striving
to
be
great
some
are
toiling
to
be
leaders
of
their
nation
or
their
state
and
in
every
man
ambition
if
we
only
understood
there
is
much
that
fine
and
splendid
every
hope
is
mostly
good
so
i
cling
unto
the
notion
that
contented
i
will
be
if
the
men
upon
life
pathway
find
a
needed
friend
in
me
i
rather
like
to
putter
the
walks
and
yards
of
life
to
spray
at
night
the
roses
that
are
burned
and
browned
with
strife
to
eat
a
frugal
dinner
but
always
to
have
a
chair
for
the
unexpected
stranger
that
my
simple
meal
would
share
i
do
care
to
be
a
traveler
i
would
rather
be
the
one
sitting
calmly
by
the
roadside
helping
weary
travelers
on
i
like
to
be
a
neighbor
in
the
good
way
finding
much
to
do
for
others
but
not
over
much
to
say
i
like
to
read
the
papers
but
i
do
not
yearn
to
see
what
the
journal
of
the
morning
has
been
moved
to
say
of
me
in
the
silences
and
shadows
i
would
live
my
life
and
die
and
depend
for
fond
remembrance
on
some
grateful
i
guess
i
was
fashioned
for
the
brilliant
things
of
earth
was
gifted
much
with
talent
or
designed
for
special
worth
but
was
just
sent
here
to
putter
with
life
little
odds
and
ends
and
keep
a
simple
corner
where
the
stirring
highway
bends
and
if
folks
should
chance
to
linger
worn
and
weary
through
the
day
to
do
some
needed
service
and
to
cheer
them
on
their
way
roses
when
god
first
viewed
the
rose
he
made
he
smiled
and
thought
it
passing
fair
upon
the
bloom
his
hands
he
laid
and
gently
blessed
each
petal
there
he
summoned
in
his
artists
then
and
bade
them
paint
as
before
each
petal
so
that
earthly
men
might
love
the
rose
for
evermore
with
heavenly
brushes
they
began
and
one
with
red
limned
every
leaf
to
signify
the
love
of
man
the
first
rose
white
betokened
grief
my
rose
shall
deck
the
bride
one
said
and
so
in
pink
he
dipped
his
brush
and
it
shall
smile
beside
the
dead
to
typify
the
faded
blush
and
then
they
came
unto
his
throne
and
laid
the
roses
at
his
feet
the
crimson
bud
the
bloom
full
blown
filling
the
air
with
fragrance
sweet
well
done
well
done
the
master
spake
henceforth
the
rose
shall
bloom
on
earth
one
fairer
blossom
i
will
make
and
then
a
little
babe
had
birth
on
earth
a
loving
mother
lay
within
a
room
and
smiled
but
from
the
blossoms
turned
away
to
gently
kiss
her
little
child
and
then
she
murmured
soft
and
low
for
beauty
here
a
mother
seeks
none
but
the
master
made
i
know
the
roses
in
a
baby
cheeks
the
junk
box
my
father
often
used
to
say
my
boy
do
throw
a
thing
away
you
find
a
use
for
it
some
day
so
in
a
box
he
stored
up
things
bent
nails
old
washers
pipes
and
rings
and
bolts
and
nuts
and
rusty
springs
despite
each
blemish
and
each
flaw
some
use
for
everything
he
saw
with
things
material
this
was
law
and
often
when
he
work
to
do
he
searched
the
junk
box
through
and
through
and
found
old
stuff
as
good
as
new
and
i
have
often
thought
since
then
that
father
did
the
same
with
men
he
knew
he
need
their
help
again
it
seems
to
me
he
understood
that
men
as
well
as
iron
and
wood
may
broken
be
and
still
be
good
despite
the
vices
he
display
he
never
threw
a
man
away
but
kept
him
for
another
day
a
human
junk
box
is
this
earth
and
into
it
we
tossed
at
birth
to
wait
the
day
we
be
of
worth
though
bent
and
twisted
weak
of
will
and
full
of
flaws
and
lacking
skill
some
service
each
can
render
still
the
boy
that
was
when
the
hair
about
the
temples
starts
to
show
the
signs
of
gray
and
a
fellow
realizes
that
he
wandering
far
away
from
the
pleasures
of
his
boyhood
and
his
youth
and
never
more
will
know
the
joy
of
laughter
as
he
did
in
days
of
yore
oh
it
then
he
starts
to
thinking
of
a
stubby
little
lad
with
a
face
as
brown
as
berries
and
a
soul
supremely
glad
when
a
dreamer
wanders
down
the
lanes
of
memory
and
forgets
the
living
present
for
the
time
of
he
takes
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
and
he
throws
his
coat
away
and
he
free
from
all
restrictions
save
the
rules
of
manly
play
he
may
be
in
richest
garments
but
bareheaded
in
the
sun
he
forgets
his
proud
successes
and
the
riches
he
has
won
oh
there
not
a
man
alive
but
that
would
give
his
all
to
be
the
stubby
little
fellow
that
in
dreamland
he
can
see
and
the
splendors
that
surround
him
and
the
joys
about
him
spread
only
seem
to
rise
to
taunt
him
with
the
boyhood
that
has
fled
when
the
hair
about
the
temples
starts
to
show
time
silver
stain
then
the
richest
man
that
living
yearns
to
be
a
boy
again
as
fall
the
leaves
as
fall
the
leaves
so
drop
the
days
in
silence
from
the
tree
of
life
born
for
a
little
while

blaze
in
action
in
the
heat
of
strife

then
to
shrivel
with
time

the
gay
road
it
tough
when
you
are
homesick
it
takes
a
heap
o
livin
in
a
house
to
make
it
home
i
sipped
a
rich
man
sparkling
wine
i
told
about
the
times
that
ma
ca
find
her
pocketbook
lady
in
the
show
case
carriage
less
hate
and
greed
let
others
sing
their
songs
of
war
life
is
a
challenge
to
the
bold
life
is
a
gift
to
be
used
every
day
little
master
mischievous
that
the
name
ma
has
a
dandy
little
book
ma
says
no
it
too
much
care
men
are
of
two
kind
and
he
most
every
night
when
they
in
bed
most
folks
as
i
noticed
in
pleasure
strife
my
father
often
used
to
say
my
pa
he
eats
his
breakfast
never
a
sigh
for
the
cares
that
she
bore
nobody
hates
me
more
than
i
none
knows
the
day
that
friends
must
part
no
one
is
beat
till
he
quits
not
for
the
sake
of
the
gold
one
day
in
ages
dim
and
dark
only
a
dad
with
a
tired
face
pa
not
so
very
big
or
brave
people
liked
him
not
because
promotion
comes
to
him
who
sticks
right
must
not
live
in
idleness
she
is
fair
to
see
and
sweet
so
long
as
men
shall
be
on
earth
some
are
eager
to
be
famous
some
folks
leave
home
for
money
some
folks
i
know
when
friends
drop
in
take
home
a
smile
forget
the
petty
cares
thankful
for
the
glory
of
the
old
red
white
and
blue
the
happiest
nights
the
green
is
in
the
meadow
the
kids
are
once
more
the
little
path
that
leads
to
home
the
man
who
wants
a
garden
fair
there
is
no
star
within
the
flag
there
must
be
great
rejoicin
on
the
golden
shore
there
a
heap
of
goodness
there
a
lot
of
joy
in
the
smiling
world
there
a
wondrous
smell
of
spices
there
nothing
that
builds
up
a
soul
there
was
a
bear
his
name
was
jim
the
skies
are
blue
and
the
sun
is
out
the
sumac
flaming
scarlet
the
things
that
have
been
done
before
the
things
that
make
a
soldier
great
the
world
too
busy
now
to
pause
is
better
to
have
tried
in
vain
to
do
your
little
bit
of
toil
to
gentle
ways
i
am
inclined
to
happiness
i
raise
my
glass
to
live
as
gently
as
i
can
time
was
when
spring
returned
we
went
was
not
so
many
years
ago
used
to
wonder
just
why
father
we
can
be
great
by
helping
one
another
we
was
speakin
of
folks
jes
common
folks
when
an
apple
tree
is
ready
for
the
world
when
god
first
viewed
the
rose
he
made
when
he
was
only
nine
months
old
when
i
was
young
and
frivolous
when
pa
comes
home
i
at
the
door
when
shall
i
be
a
man
he
said
when
the
hair
about
the
temples
starts
to
show
the
signs
of
gray
when
you
get
to
know
a
fellow
who
does
his
task
from
day
to
day
who
has
a
troop
of
romping
youth
who
once
has
had
a
friend
has
found
you
can
not
gather
every
rose
you
can
talk
about
your
music
you
do
not
know
it
little
man
you
do
begrudge
the
labor
you
ought
to
be
fine
for
the
sake
of
the
folks
