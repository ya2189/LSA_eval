the
green
helmet
and
other
poems
his
dream
i
swayed
upon
the
gaudy
stern
the
butt
end
of
a
steering
oar
and
everywhere
that
i
could
turn
men
ran
upon
the
shore
and
though
i
would
have
hushed
the
crowd
there
was
no
mother
son
but
said
what
is
the
figure
in
a
shroud
upon
a
gaudy
bed
and
fishes
bubbling
to
the
brim
cried
out
upon
that
thing
beneath
it
had
such
dignity
of
limb
by
the
sweet
name
of
death
though
i
my
finger
on
my
lip
what
could
i
but
take
up
the
song
and
fish
and
crowd
and
gaudy
ship
cried
out
the
whole
night
long
crying
amid
the
glittering
sea
naming
it
with
ecstatic
breath
because
it
had
such
dignity
by
the
sweet
name
of
death
a
woman
homer
sung
if
any
man
drew
near
when
i
was
young
i
thought
he
holds
her
dear
and
shook
with
hate
and
fear
but
oh
was
bitter
wrong
if
he
could
pass
her
by
with
an
indifferent
eye
whereon
i
wrote
and
wrought
and
now
being
gray
i
dream
that
i
have
brought
to
such
a
pitch
my
thought
that
coming
time
can
say
he
shadowed
in
a
glass
what
thing
her
body
was
for
she
had
fiery
blood
when
i
was
young
and
trod
so
sweetly
proud
as
upon
a
cloud
a
woman
homer
sung
that
life
and
letters
seem
but
an
heroic
dream
that
the
night
come
she
lived
in
storm
and
strife
her
soul
had
such
desire
for
what
proud
death
may
bring
that
it
could
not
endure
the
common
good
of
life
but
lived
as
a
king
that
packed
his
marriage
day
with
banneret
and
pennon
trumpet
and
kettledrum
and
the
outrageous
cannon
to
bundle
time
away
that
the
night
come
the
consolation
i
had
this
thought
awhile
ago
my
darling
can
not
understand
what
i
have
done
or
what
would
do
in
this
blind
bitter
land
and
i
grew
weary
of
the
sun
until
my
thoughts
cleared
up
again
remembering
that
the
best
i
have
done
was
done
to
make
it
plain
that
every
year
i
have
cried
at
length
my
darling
understands
it
all
because
i
have
come
into
my
strength
and
words
obey
my
call
that
had
she
done
so
who
can
say
what
would
have
shaken
from
the
sieve
i
might
have
thrown
poor
words
away
and
been
content
to
live
friends
now
must
i
these
three
praise
three
women
that
have
wrought
what
joy
is
in
my
days
one
that
no
passing
thought
nor
those
unpassing
cares
no
not
in
these
fifteen
many
times
troubled
years
could
ever
come
between
heart
and
delighted
heart
and
one
because
her
hand
had
strength
that
could
unbind
what
none
can
understand
what
none
can
have
and
thrive
youth
dreamy
load
till
she
so
changed
me
that
i
live
labouring
in
ecstasy
and
what
of
her
that
took
all
till
my
youth
was
gone
with
scarce
a
pitying
look
how
should
i
praise
that
one
when
day
begins
to
break
i
count
my
good
and
bad
being
wakeful
for
her
sake
remembering
what
she
had
what
eagle
look
still
shows
while
up
from
my
heart
root
so
great
a
sweetness
flows
i
shake
from
head
to
foot
no
second
troy
why
should
i
blame
her
that
she
filled
my
days
with
misery
or
that
she
would
of
late
have
taught
to
ignorant
men
most
violent
ways
or
hurled
the
little
streets
upon
the
great
had
they
but
courage
equal
to
desire
what
could
have
made
her
peaceful
with
a
mind
that
nobleness
made
simple
as
a
fire
with
beauty
like
a
tightened
bow
a
kind
that
is
not
natural
in
an
age
like
this
being
high
and
solitary
and
most
stern
why
what
could
she
have
done
being
what
she
is
was
there
another
troy
for
her
to
burn
reconciliation
some
may
have
blamed
you
that
you
took
away
the
verses
that
could
move
them
on
the
day
when
the
ears
being
deafened
the
sight
of
the
eyes
blind
with
lightning
you
went
from
me
and
i
could
find
nothing
to
make
a
song
about
but
kings
helmets
and
swords
and
things
that
were
like
memories
of
you
but
now
we
out
for
the
world
lives
as
long
ago
and
while
we
in
our
laughing
weeping
fit
hurl
helmets
crowns
and
swords
into
the
pit
but
dear
cling
close
to
me
since
you
were
gone
my
barren
thoughts
have
chilled
me
to
the
bone
king
and
no
king
would
it
were
anything
but
merely
voice
the
no
king
cried
who
after
that
was
king
because
he
had
not
heard
of
anything
that
balanced
with
a
word
is
more
than
noise
yet
old
romance
being
kind
let
him
prevail
somewhere
or
somehow
that
i
have
forgot
though
he
but
cannon
whereas
we
that
had
thought
to
have
lit
upon
as
clean
and
sweet
a
tale
have
been
defeated
by
that
pledge
you
gave
in
momentary
anger
long
ago
and
i
that
have
not
your
faith
how
shall
i
know
that
in
the
blinding
light
beyond
the
grave
we
find
so
good
a
thing
as
that
we
have
lost
the
hourly
kindness
the
day
common
speech
the
habitual
content
of
each
with
each
when
neither
soul
nor
body
has
been
crossed
the
cold
heaven
suddenly
i
saw
the
cold
and
rook
delighting
heaven
that
seemed
as
though
ice
burned
and
was
but
the
more
ice
and
thereupon
imagination
and
heart
were
driven
so
wild
that
every
casual
thought
of
that
and
this
vanished
and
left
but
memories
that
should
be
out
of
season
with
the
hot
blood
of
youth
of
love
crossed
long
ago
and
i
took
all
the
blame
out
of
all
sense
and
reason
until
i
cried
and
trembled
and
rocked
to
and
fro
riddled
with
light
ah
when
the
ghost
begins
to
quicken
confusion
of
the
over
is
it
sent
out
naked
on
the
roads
as
the
books
say
and
stricken
by
the
injustice
of
the
skies
for
punishment
peace
ah
that
time
could
touch
a
form
that
could
show
what
homer
age
bred
to
be
a
hero
wage
were
not
all
her
life
but
storm
would
not
painters
paint
a
form
of
such
noble
lines
i
said
such
a
delicate
high
head
so
much
sternness
and
such
charm
till
they
had
changed
us
to
like
strength
ah
but
peace
that
comes
at
length
came
when
time
had
touched
her
form
against
unworthy
praise
o
heart
be
at
peace
because
nor
knave
nor
dolt
can
break
what
not
for
their
applause
being
for
a
woman
sake
enough
if
the
work
has
seemed
so
did
she
your
strength
renew
a
dream
that
a
lion
had
dreamed
till
the
wilderness
cried
aloud
a
secret
between
you
two
between
the
proud
and
the
proud
what
still
you
would
have
their
praise
but
here
a
haughtier
text
the
labyrinth
of
her
days
that
her
own
strangeness
perplexed
and
how
what
her
dreaming
gave
earned
slander
ingratitude
from
dolt
and
knave
aye
and
worse
wrong
than
these
yet
she
singing
upon
her
road
half
lion
half
child
is
at
peace
the
fascination
of
what
difficult
the
fascination
of
what
difficult
has
dried
the
sap
out
of
my
veins
and
rent
spontaneous
joy
and
natural
content
out
of
my
heart
there
something
ails
our
colt
that
must
as
if
it
had
not
holy
blood
nor
on
an
olympus
leaped
from
cloud
to
cloud
shiver
under
the
lash
strain
sweat
and
jolt
as
though
it
dragged
road
metal
my
curse
on
plays
that
have
to
be
set
up
in
fifty
ways
on
the
day
war
with
every
knave
and
dolt
theatre
business
management
of
men
i
swear
before
the
dawn
comes
round
again
i
find
the
stable
and
pull
out
the
bolt
a
drinking
song
wine
comes
in
at
the
mouth
and
love
comes
in
at
the
eye
that
all
we
shall
know
for
truth
before
we
grow
old
and
die
i
lift
the
glass
to
my
mouth
i
look
at
you
and
i
sigh
the
coming
of
wisdom
with
time
though
leaves
are
many
the
root
is
one
through
all
the
lying
days
of
my
youth
i
swayed
my
leaves
and
flowers
in
the
sun
now
i
may
wither
into
the
truth
on
hearing
that
the
students
of
our
new
university
have
joined
the
ancient
order
of
hibernians
and
the
agitation
against
immoral
literature
where
where
but
here
have
pride
and
truth
that
long
to
give
themselves
for
wage
to
shake
their
wicked
sides
at
youth
restraining
reckless
to
a
poet
who
would
have
me
praise
certain
bad
poets
imitators
of
his
and
mine
you
say
as
i
have
often
given
tongue
in
praise
of
what
another
said
or
sung
politic
to
do
the
like
by
these
but
where
the
wild
dog
that
has
praised
his
fleas
the
attack
on
the
play
boy
once
when
midnight
smote
the
air
eunuchs
ran
through
hell
and
met
round
about
hell
gate
to
stare
at
great
juan
riding
by
and
like
these
to
rail
and
sweat
maddened
by
that
sinewy
thigh
a
lyric
from
an
unpublished
play
put
off
that
mask
of
burning
gold
with
emerald
eyes
o
no
my
dear
you
make
so
bold
to
find
if
hearts
be
wild
and
wise
and
yet
not
cold
i
would
but
find
what
there
to
find
love
or
deceit
it
was
the
mask
engaged
your
mind
and
after
set
your
heart
to
beat
not
what
behind
but
lest
you
are
my
enemy
i
must
enquire
o
no
my
dear
let
all
that
be
what
matter
so
there
is
but
fire
in
you
in
me
upon
a
house
shaken
by
the
land
agitation
how
should
the
world
be
luckier
if
this
house
where
passion
and
precision
have
been
one
time
out
of
mind
became
too
ruinous
to
breed
the
lidless
eye
that
loves
the
sun
and
the
sweet
laughing
eagle
thoughts
that
grow
where
wings
have
memory
of
wings
and
all
that
comes
of
the
best
knit
to
the
best
although
mean
were
the
sturdier
for
its
fall
how
should
their
luck
run
high
enough
to
reach
the
gifts
that
govern
men
and
after
these
to
gradual
time
last
gift
a
written
speech
wrought
of
high
laughter
loveliness
and
ease
at
the
abbey
theatre
from
dear
craoibhin
aoibhin
look
into
our
case
when
we
are
high
and
airy
hundreds
say
that
if
we
hold
that
flight
they
leave
the
place
while
those
same
hundreds
mock
another
day
because
we
have
made
our
art
of
common
things
so
bitterly
you
dream
they
longed
to
look
all
their
lives
through
into
some
drift
of
wings
you
dandled
them
and
fed
them
from
the
book
and
know
them
to
the
bone
impart
to
us
we
keep
the
secret
a
new
trick
to
please
is
there
a
bridle
for
this
proteus
that
turns
and
changes
like
his
draughty
seas
or
is
there
none
most
popular
of
men
but
when
they
mock
us
that
we
mock
again
these
are
the
clouds
these
are
the
clouds
about
the
fallen
sun
the
majesty
that
shuts
his
burning
eye
the
weak
lay
hand
on
what
the
strong
has
done
till
that
be
tumbled
that
was
lifted
high
and
discord
follow
upon
unison
and
all
things
at
one
common
level
lie
and
therefore
friend
if
your
great
race
were
run
and
these
things
came
so
much
the
more
thereby
have
you
made
greatness
your
companion
although
it
be
for
children
that
you
sigh
these
are
the
clouds
about
the
fallen
sun
the
majesty
that
shuts
his
burning
eye
at
galway
races
out
yonder
where
the
race
course
is
delight
makes
all
of
the
one
mind
riders
upon
the
swift
horses
the
field
that
closes
in
behind
we
too
had
good
attendance
once
hearers
and
hearteners
of
the
work
aye
horsemen
for
companions
before
the
merchant
and
the
clerk
breathed
on
the
world
with
timid
breath
sing
on
sometime
and
at
some
new
moon
we
learn
that
sleeping
is
not
death
hearing
the
whole
earth
change
its
tune
its
flesh
being
wild
and
it
again
crying
aloud
as
the
race
course
is
and
we
find
hearteners
among
men
that
ride
upon
horses
a
friend
illness
sickness
brought
me
this
thought
in
that
scale
of
his
why
should
i
be
dismayed
though
flame
had
burned
the
whole
world
as
it
were
a
coal
now
i
have
seen
it
weighed
against
a
soul
all
things
can
tempt
me
all
things
can
tempt
me
from
this
craft
of
verse
one
time
it
was
a
woman
face
or
worse
the
seeming
needs
of
my
land
now
nothing
but
comes
readier
to
the
hand
than
this
accustomed
toil
when
i
was
young
i
had
not
given
a
penny
for
a
song
did
not
the
poet
sing
it
with
such
airs
that
one
believed
he
had
a
sword
upstairs
yet
would
be
now
could
i
but
have
my
wish
colder
and
dumber
and
deafer
than
a
fish
the
young
man
song
i
whispered
i
am
too
young
and
then
i
am
old
enough
wherefore
i
threw
a
penny
to
find
out
if
i
might
love
go
and
love
go
and
love
young
man
if
the
lady
be
young

fair
ah
penny

i

hair
oh
love
is
the
crooked
thing
there
is
nobody
wise
enough
to
find
out
all
that
is
in
it
for
he
would
be
thinking
of
love
till
the
stars
had
run
away
and
the
shadows
eaten

through

and
she
makes
light
of
us
though
our

do
all
that
they
can
she
spreads
her
tail
like
a
peacock
and
praises
none

long
green
cloak
that
covers

not
come

with
pride
the
flagon
full
to
the
brim
the
front
door
standing
wide
you
put
me
off
with
words
but
the
whole
thing
plain
enough
you
are
waiting
for
some
message
to
bring
you
to
war
or
love
in
that
old
secret
country
beyond
the
waves
or
it
may
be
down
beneath
them
in
caves
where
nine
forsaken
sea
queens
fling
shuttles
to
and
fro
but
beyond
them
or
beneath
them
whether
you
will
or
no
i
am
going
too
laegaire
better
tell
it
all
out
to
the
end
he
was
born
to
luck
in
the
cradle
his
good
luck
may
amend
the
bad
luck
we
were
born
to
conall
i
lay
the
whole
thing
bare
you
saw
the
luck
that
he
had
when
he
pushed
in
past
me
there
does
anything
stir
on
the
sea
laegaire
not
even
a
fish
or
a
gull
conall
you
were
gone
but
a
little
while
we
were
there
and
the
full
we
were
half
drunk
and
merry
and
midnight
on
the
stroke
when
a
wide
high
man
came
in
with
a
red
foxy
cloak
with
foxy
eyes
and
a
great
laughing
mouth
and
he
said
when
we
bid
him
drink
that
he
had
so
great
a
drouth
he
could
drink
the
sea
cuchulain
i
thought
he
had
come
from
one
of
you
out
of
some
connaught
rath
and
would
lap
up
milk
and
mew
but
if
he
so
loved
water
i
have
the
tale
awry
conall
you
would
not
be
so
merry
if
he
were
standing
by
for
when
we
had
sung
or
danced
as
he
were
our
next
of
kin
he
promised
to
show
us
a
game
the
best
that
ever
had
been
and
when
we
had
asked
what
game
he
answered
why
whip
off
my
head
then
one
of
you
two
stoop
down
and
i
whip
off
his
he
said
a
head
for
a
head
he
said
that
is
the
game
that
i
play
cuchulain
how
could
he
whip
off
a
head
when
his
own
had
been
whipped
away
conall
we
told
him
it
over
and
over
and
that
ale
had
fuddled
his
wit
but
he
stood
and
laughed
at
us
there
as
though
his
sides
would
split
till
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
whipped
off
his
head
at
a
blow
being
mad
that
he
did
not
answer
and
more
at
his
laughing
so
and
there
on
the
ground
where
it
fell
it
went
on
laughing
at
me
laegaire
till
he
took
it
up
in
his
hands
conall
and
splashed
himself
into
the
sea
cuchulain
i
have
imagined
as
good
when
i
been
as
deep
in
the
cup
laegaire
you
never
did
cuchulain
and
believed
it
conall
cuchulain
when
will
you
stop
boasting
of
your
great
deeds
and
weighing
yourself
with
us
two
and
crying
out
to
the
world
whatever
we
say
or
do
that
you
said
or
done
a
better
nor
is
it
a
drunkard
tale
though
we
said
to
ourselves
at
first
that
it
all
came
out
of
the
ale
and
thinking
that
if
we
told
it
we
should
be
a
swore
we
should
keep
it
secret
laegaire
but
twelve
months
upon
the
clock
conall
a
twelvemonth
from
the
first
time
laegaire
and
the
jug
full
up
to
the
brim
for
we
had
been
put
from
our
drinking
by
the
very
thought
of
him
conall
we
stood
as
we
standing
now
laegaire
the
horns
were
as
empty
conall
when
he
ran
up
out
of
the
sea
with
his
head
on
his
shoulders
again
cuchulain
why
this
is
a
tale
worth
telling
conall
and
he
called
for
his
debt
and
his
right
and
said
that
the
land
was
disgraced
because
of
us
two
from
that
night
if
we
did
not
pay
him
his
debt
laegaire
what
is
there
to
be
said
when
a
man
with
a
right
to
get
it
has
come
to
ask
for
your
head
conall
if
you
had
been
sitting
there
you
had
been
silent
like
us
laegaire
he
said
that
in
twelve
months
more
he
would
come
again
to
this
house
and
ask
his
debt
again
twelve
months
are
up
conall
he
would
have
followed
after
if
we
had
run
away
laegaire
will
he
tell
every
mother
son
that
we
have
broken
our
word
cuchulain
whether
he
does
or
does
not
we
drive
him
out
with
the
sword
and
take
his
life
in
the
bargain
if
he
but
dare
to
scoff
conall
how
can
you
fight
with
a
head
that
laughs
when
you
whipped
it
off
laegaire
or
a
man
that
can
pick
it
up
and
carry
it
out
in
his
hand
conall
he
is
coming
now
there
a
splash
and
a
rumble
along
the
strand
as
when
he
came
last
cuchulain
come
and
put
all
your
backs
to
the
door
tall
man
stands
upon
the
threshold
against
the
misty
green
of
the
sea
the
ground
higher
without
than
within
the
house
makes
him
seem
taller
even
than
he
is
he
leans
upon
a
great
laegaire
it
is
too
late
to
shut
it
for
there
he
stands
once
more
and
laughs
like
the
sea
cuchulain
old
herring
you
whip
off
heads
why
then
whip
off
your
own
for
it
seems
you
can
clap
it
on
again
or
else
go
down
in
the
sea
go
down
in
the
sea
i
say
find
that
old
juggler
manannan
and
whip
his
head
away
or
the
red
man
of
the
boyne
for
they
are
of
your
own
sort
or
if
the
waves
have
vexed
you
and
you
would
find
a
sport
of
a
more
irish
fashion
go
fight
without
a
rest
a
caterwauling
phantom
among
the
winds
of
the
west
but
what
are
you
waiting
for
into
the
water
i
say
if
there
no
sword
can
harm
you

an
older
trick

old
trick
to
tumble
you
out
of

foxy
man

where
we
sat
in
the
hall
getting
our
supper
ready
with
a
great
voice
like
the
wind
and
cried
that
there
was
a
helmet
or
something
of
the
kind
that
was
for
the
foremost
man
upon
the
ridge
of
the
earth
so
i
cried
your
name
through
the
hall
others
cry
out
and
blow
horns
partly
drowning
the
rest
of
his
but
they
denied
its
worth
preferring
laegaire
or
conall
and
they
cried
to
drown
my
voice
but
i
have
so
strong
a
throat
that
i
drowned
all
their
noise
till
they
took
to
the
hunting
horns
and
blew
them
into
my
face
and
as
neither
side
would
give
in
we
would
settle
it
in
this
place
let
the
helmet
be
taken
from
conall
a
stable
boy

the
best
man

the
murderous
cats

rivalry
might
cease

have
turned
that
murderous
cat
into
a
cup
of
peace
i
drank
the
first
and
then
conall
give
it
to
laegaire
now
gives
helmet
to
that
it
may
purr
in
his
hand
and
all
of
our
servants
know
that
since
the
ale
went
in
its
claws
went
out
of
sight
a
servant
that
well
i
will
stop
my
shouting
another
cuchulain
is
in
the
right
i
am
tired
of
this
big
horn
that
has
made
me
hoarse
as
a
rook
laeg
cuchulain
you
drank
the
first
another
by
drinking
the
first
he
took
the
whole
of
the
honours
himself
laeg

you
drank
the
first

laegaire

cuchulain
and
conall
have
drunk
another
he
is
lost

a
drop
laegaire
helmet
on
did
you
claim
to
be
better
than
us
by
drinking
first
from
the
cup
cuchulain
words
are
partly
drowned
by
the
murmurs
of
the
crowd
though
he
speaks
very
that
juggler
from
the
sea
that
old
red
herring
it
is
who
has
set
us
all
by
the
ears
he
brought
the
helmet
for
this
and
because
we
would
not
quarrel
he
ran
elsewhere
to
shout
that
conall
and
laegaire
wronged
me
till
all
had
fallen
out
murmur
grows
less
so
that
his
words
are
who
knows
where
he
is
now
or
who
he
is
spurring
to
fight
so
get
you
gone
and
whatever
may
cry
aloud
in
the
night
or
show
itself
in
the

blow
their
horns
or
fight
among

there
is
a
deafening
noise
and
a
confused
fight
suddenly
three
black
hands
come
through
the
windows
and
put
out
the
torches
it
is
now
pitch
dark
but
for
a
faint
light
outside
the
house
which
merely
shows
that
there
are
moving
forms
but
not
who
or
what
they
are
and
in
the
darkness
one
can
hear
low
terrified
a
voice
and
headed
like
cats
they
came
up
over
the
strand
another
voice
and
i
saw
one
stretch
to
a
torch
and
cover
it
with
his
hand
another
voice
another
sooty
fellow
has
plucked
the
moon
from
the
air
light
gradually
comes
into
the
house
from
the
sea
on
which
the
moon
begins
to
show
once
more
there
is
no
light
within
the
house
and
the
great
beams
of
the
walls
are
dark
and
full
of
shadows
and
the
persons
of
the
play
dark
too
against
the
light
the
red
man
is
seen
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
house
the
black
men
crouch
and
stand
about
the
door
one
carries
the
helmet
one
the
great
red
man
i
demand
the
debt
that
owing
let
some
man
kneel
down
there
that
i
may
cut
his
head
off
or
all
shall
go
to
wrack
cuchulain
he
played
and
paid
with
his
head
and
it
right
that
we
pay
him
back
and
give
him
more
than
he
gave
for
he
comes
in
here
as
a
guest
so
i
will
give
him
my
head
begins
to
little
wife
little
wife

at
rest
alive
i
have
been
far
off
in
all
lands
under
sun
and
been
no
faithful
man
but
when
my
story
is
done
my
fame
shall
spring
up
and
laugh
and
set
you
high
above
all
emer
her
arms
about
it
is
you
not
your
fame
that
i
love
cuchulain
to
put
her
from
you
are
young
you
are
wise
you
can
call
some
kinder
and
comelier
man
that
will
sit
at
home
in
the
house
emer
live
and
be
faithless
still
cuchulain
her
from
would
you
stay
the
great
when
its
eyes
are
turned
to
the
sea
and
its
beak
to
the
salt
of
the
air
emer
her
dagger
to
stab
i
too
on
the
grey
wing
path
cuchulain
do
you
dare
do
you
dare
do
you
dare
bear
children
and
sweep
the
house
his
way
through
the
servants
who
gather
wail
but
keep
from
the
road
kneels
before
red
man
there
is
a
quick
to
your
work
old
radish
you
will
fade
when
the
cocks
have
crowed
black
man
holds
out
the
helmet
the
red
man
takes
red
man
i
have
not
come
for
your
hurt
i
the
rector
of
this
land
and
with
my
spitting
my
frenzied
band
age
after
age
i
sift
it
and
choose
for
its
championship
the
man
who
hits
my
fancy
places
the
helmet
on
cuchulain
and
i
choose
the
laughing
lip
that
shall
not
turn
from
laughing
whatever
rise
or
fall
the
heart
that
grows
no
bitterer
although
betrayed
by
all
the
hand
that
loves
to
scatter
the
life
like
a
gambler
throw
and
these
things
i
make
prosper
till
a
day
come
that
i
know
when
heart
and
mind
shall
darken
that
the
weak
may
end
the
strong
and
the
long
remembering
harpers
have
matter
for
their
song
