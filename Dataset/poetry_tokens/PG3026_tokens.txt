this
book
of
people
the
pasture
i
going
out
to
clean
the
pasture
spring
i
only
stop
to
rake
the
leaves
away
and
wait
to
watch
the
water
clear
i
may
i
be
gone
you
come
too
i
going
out
to
fetch
the
little
calf
that
standing
by
the
mother
it
so
young
it
totters
when
she
licks
it
with
her
tongue
i
be
gone
you
come
too
contents
mending
wall
the
death
of
the
hired
man
the
mountain
a
hundred
collars
home
burial
the
black
cottage
blueberries
a
servant
to
servants
after
the
code
the
generations
of
men
the
housekeeper
the
fear
the
the
good
hours
mending
wall
something
there
is
that
does
love
a
wall
that
sends
the
under
it
and
spills
the
upper
boulders
in
the
sun
and
makes
gaps
even
two
can
pass
abreast
the
work
of
hunters
is
another
thing
i
have
come
after
them
and
made
repair
where
they
have
left
not
one
stone
on
a
stone
but
they
would
have
the
rabbit
out
of
hiding
to
please
the
yelping
dogs
the
gaps
i
mean
no
one
has
seen
them
made
or
heard
them
made
but
at
spring
we
find
them
there
i
let
my
neighbour
know
beyond
the
hill
and
on
a
day
we
meet
to
walk
the
line
and
set
the
wall
between
us
once
again
we
keep
the
wall
between
us
as
we
go
to
each
the
boulders
that
have
fallen
to
each
and
some
are
loaves
and
some
so
nearly
balls
we
have
to
use
a
spell
to
make
them
balance
stay
where
you
are
until
our
backs
are
turned
we
wear
our
fingers
rough
with
handling
them
oh
just
another
kind
of
game
one
on
a
side
it
comes
to
little
more
there
where
it
is
we
do
not
need
the
wall
he
is
all
pine
and
i
am
apple
orchard
my
apple
trees
will
never
get
across
and
eat
the
cones
under
his
pines
i
tell
him
he
only
says
good
fences
make
good
neighbours
spring
is
the
mischief
in
me
and
i
wonder
if
i
could
put
a
notion
in
his
head
why
do
they
make
good
neighbours
is
it
where
there
are
cows
but
here
there
are
no
cows
before
i
built
a
wall
i
ask
to
know
what
i
was
walling
in
or
walling
out
and
to
whom
i
was
like
to
give
offence
something
there
is
that
does
love
a
wall
that
wants
it
down
i
could
say
elves
to
him
but
it
not
elves
exactly
and
i
rather
he
said
it
for
himself
i
see
him
there
bringing
a
stone
grasped
firmly
by
the
top
in
each
hand
like
an
savage
armed
he
moves
in
darkness
as
it
seems
to
me
not
of
woods
only
and
the
shade
of
trees
he
will
not
go
behind
his
father
saying
and
he
likes
having
thought
of
it
so
well
he
says
again
good
fences
make
good
neighbours
the
death
of
the
hired
man
mary
sat
musing
on
the
at
the
table
waiting
for
warren
when
she
heard
his
step
she
ran
on
down
the
darkened
passage
to
meet
him
in
the
doorway
with
the
news
and
put
him
on
his
guard
silas
is
back
she
pushed
him
outward
with
her
through
the
door
and
shut
it
after
her
be
kind
she
said
she
took
the
market
things
from
warren
arms
and
set
them
on
the
porch
then
drew
him
down
to
sit
beside
her
on
the
wooden
steps
when
was
i
ever
anything
but
kind
to
him
but
i
not
have
the
fellow
back
he
said
i
told
him
so
last
haying
did
i
he
left
then
i
said
ended
it
what
good
is
he
who
else
will
harbour
him
at
his
age
for
the
little
he
can
do
what
help
he
is
there
no
depending
on
off
he
goes
always
when
i
need
him
most
thinks
he
ought
to
earn
a
little
pay
enough
at
least
to
buy
tobacco
with
so
he
wo
have
to
beg
and
be
beholden
right
i
say
ca
afford
to
pay
any
fixed
wages
though
i
wish
i
could
else
can
someone
else
will
have
to
i
should
mind
his
bettering
himself
if
that
was
what
it
was
you
can
be
certain
when
he
begins
like
that
there
someone
at
him
trying
to
coax
him
off
with
in
haying
time
when
any
help
is
scarce
in
winter
he
comes
back
to
us
i
done
sh
not
so
loud
he
hear
you
mary
said
i
want
him
to
he
have
to
soon
or
late
he
worn
out
he
asleep
beside
the
stove
when
i
came
up
from
rowe
i
found
him
here
huddled
against
the
fast
asleep
a
miserable
sight
and
frightening
too
you
need
smile
i
did
recognise
him
i
was
looking
for
him
and
he
changed
wait
till
you
see
where
did
you
say
he
been
he
did
say
i
dragged
him
to
the
house
and
gave
him
tea
and
tried
to
make
him
smoke
i
tried
to
make
him
talk
about
his
travels
nothing
would
do
he
just
kept
nodding
off
what
did
he
say
did
he
say
anything
but
little
anything
mary
confess
he
said
he
come
to
ditch
the
meadow
for
me
warren
but
did
he
i
just
want
to
know
of
course
he
did
what
would
you
have
him
say
surely
you
would
grudge
the
poor
old
man
some
humble
way
to
save
his
he
added
if
you
really
care
to
know
he
meant
to
clear
the
upper
pasture
too
that
sounds
like
something
you
have
heard
before
warren
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
the
way
he
jumbled
everything
i
stopped
to
look
two
or
three
times
he
made
me
feel
so
queer
to
see
if
he
was
talking
in
his
sleep
he
ran
on
harold
wilson
you
remember
the
boy
you
had
in
haying
four
years
since
he
finished
school
and
teaching
in
his
college
silas
declares
you
have
to
get
him
back
he
says
they
two
will
make
a
team
for
work
between
them
they
will
lay
this
farm
as
smooth
the
way
he
mixed
that
in
with
other
things
he
thinks
young
wilson
a
likely
lad
though
daft
on
education
you
know
how
they
fought
all
through
july
under
the
blazing
sun
silas
up
on
the
cart
to
build
the
load
harold
along
beside
to
pitch
it
on
yes
i
took
care
to
keep
well
out
of
earshot
well
those
days
trouble
silas
like
a
dream
you
would
think
they
would
how
some
things
linger
harold
young
college
boy
assurance
piqued
him
after
so
many
years
he
still
keeps
finding
good
arguments
he
sees
he
might
have
used
i
sympathise
i
know
just
how
it
feels
to
think
of
the
right
thing
to
say
too
late
harold
associated
in
his
mind
with
latin
he
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
harold
saying
he
studied
latin
like
the
violin
because
he
liked
it
that
an
argument
he
said
he
could
make
the
boy
believe
he
could
find
water
with
a
hazel
prong
which
showed
how
much
good
school
had
ever
done
him
he
wanted
to
go
over
that
but
most
of
all
he
thinks
if
he
could
have
another
chance
to
teach
him
how
to
build
a
load
of
hay
i
know
that
silas
one
accomplishment
he
bundles
every
forkful
in
its
place
and
tags
and
numbers
it
for
future
reference
so
he
can
find
and
easily
dislodge
it
in
the
unloading
silas
does
that
well
he
takes
it
out
in
bunches
like
big
birds
nests
you
never
see
him
standing
on
the
hay
he
trying
to
lift
straining
to
lift
himself
he
thinks
if
he
could
teach
him
that
he
be
some
good
perhaps
to
someone
in
the
world
he
hates
to
see
a
boy
the
fool
of
books
poor
silas
so
concerned
for
other
folk
and
nothing
to
look
backward
to
with
pride
and
nothing
to
look
forward
to
with
hope
so
now
and
never
any
different
part
of
a
moon
was
falling
down
the
west
dragging
the
whole
sky
with
it
to
the
hills
its
light
poured
softly
in
her
lap
she
saw
and
spread
her
apron
to
it
she
put
out
her
hand
among
the
strings
taut
with
the
dew
from
garden
bed
to
eaves
as
if
she
played
unheard
the
tenderness
that
wrought
on
him
beside
her
in
the
night
warren
she
said
he
has
come
home
to
die
you
need
be
afraid
he
leave
you
this
time
home
he
mocked
gently
yes
what
else
but
home
it
all
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
home
of
course
he
nothing
to
us
any
more
than
was
the
hound
that
came
a
stranger
to
us
out
of
the
woods
worn
out
upon
the
trail
home
is
the
place
where
when
you
have
to
go
there
they
have
to
take
you
in
i
should
have
called
it
something
you
somehow
have
to
deserve
warren
leaned
out
and
took
a
step
or
two
picked
up
a
little
stick
and
brought
it
back
and
broke
it
in
his
hand
and
tossed
it
by
silas
has
better
claim
on
us
you
think
than
on
his
brother
thirteen
little
miles
as
the
road
winds
would
bring
him
to
his
door
silas
has
walked
that
far
no
doubt
why
did
he
go
there
his
brother
rich
a
somebody
director
in
the
bank
he
never
told
us
that
we
know
it
though
i
think
his
brother
ought
to
help
of
course
i
see
to
that
if
there
is
need
he
ought
of
right
to
take
him
in
and
might
be
willing
to
he
may
be
better
than
appearances
but
have
some
pity
on
silas
do
you
think
if
he
had
any
pride
in
claiming
kin
or
anything
he
looked
for
from
his
brother
he
keep
so
still
about
him
all
this
time
i
wonder
what
between
them
i
can
tell
you
silas
is
what
he
is
we
would
mind
him
but
just
the
kind
that
kinsfolk
ca
abide
he
never
did
a
thing
so
very
bad
he
do
know
why
he
is
quite
as
good
as
anyone
he
wo
be
made
ashamed
to
please
his
brother
worthless
though
he
is
i
ca
think
si
ever
hurt
anyone
no
but
he
hurt
my
heart
the
way
he
lay
and
rolled
his
old
head
on
that
he
would
let
me
put
him
on
the
lounge
you
must
go
in
and
see
what
you
can
do
i
made
the
bed
up
for
him
there
you
be
surprised
at
him
how
much
he
broken
his
working
days
are
done
i
sure
of
it
i
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
say
that
i
have
been
go
look
see
for
yourself
but
warren
please
remember
how
it
is
he
come
to
help
you
ditch
the
meadow
he
has
a
plan
you
must
laugh
at
him
he
may
not
speak
of
it
and
then
he
may
i
sit
and
see
if
that
small
sailing
cloud
will
hit
or
miss
the
moon
it
hit
the
moon
then
there
were
three
there
making
a
dim
row
the
moon
the
little
silver
cloud
and
she
warren
returned
too
soon
it
seemed
to
her
slipped
to
her
side
caught
up
her
hand
and
waited
warren
she
questioned
dead
was
all
he
answered
the
mountain
the
mountain
held
the
town
as
in
a
shadow
i
saw
so
much
before
i
slept
there
once
i
noticed
that
i
missed
stars
in
the
west
where
its
black
body
cut
into
the
sky
near
me
it
seemed
i
felt
it
like
a
wall
behind
which
i
was
sheltered
from
a
wind
and
yet
between
the
town
and
it
i
found
when
i
walked
forth
at
dawn
to
see
new
things
were
fields
a
river
and
beyond
more
fields
the
river
at
the
time
was
fallen
away
and
made
a
widespread
brawl
on
but
the
signs
showed
what
it
had
done
in
spring
good
gullied
out
and
in
the
grass
ridges
of
sand
and
driftwood
stripped
of
bark
i
crossed
the
river
and
swung
round
the
mountain
and
there
i
met
a
man
who
moved
so
slow
with
oxen
in
a
heavy
cart
it
seemed
no
hand
to
stop
him
altogether
what
town
is
this
i
asked
this
lunenburg
then
i
was
wrong
the
town
of
my
sojourn
beyond
the
bridge
was
not
that
of
the
mountain
but
only
felt
at
night
its
shadowy
presence
where
is
your
village
very
far
from
here
there
is
no
village
only
scattered
farms
we
were
but
sixty
voters
last
election
we
ca
in
nature
grow
to
many
more
that
thing
takes
all
the
room
he
moved
his
goad
the
mountain
stood
there
to
be
pointed
at
pasture
ran
up
the
side
a
little
way
and
then
there
was
a
wall
of
trees
with
trunks
after
that
only
tops
of
trees
and
cliffs
imperfectly
concealed
among
the
leaves
a
dry
ravine
emerged
from
under
boughs
into
the
pasture
that
looks
like
a
path
is
that
the
way
to
reach
the
top
from
here
not
for
this
morning
but
some
other
time
i
must
be
getting
back
to
breakfast
now
i
do
advise
your
trying
from
this
side
there
is
no
proper
path
but
those
that
have
been
up
i
understand
have
climbed
from
ladd
that
five
miles
back
you
ca
mistake
the
place
they
logged
it
there
last
winter
some
way
up
i
take
you
but
i
bound
the
other
way
you
never
climbed
it
i
been
on
the
sides
and
there
a
brook
that
starts
up
on
it
somewhere
i
heard
say
right
on
the
top
a
curious
thing
but
what
would
interest
you
about
the
brook
it
always
cold
in
summer
warm
in
winter
one
of
the
great
sights
going
is
to
see
it
steam
in
winter
like
an
ox
breath
until
the
bushes
all
along
its
banks
are
with
the
frosty
spines
and
bristles
you
know
the
kind
then
let
the
sun
shine
on
it
there
ought
to
be
a
view
around
the
world
from
such
a
mountain
if
it
is
wooded
clear
to
the
top
i
saw
through
leafy
screens
great
granite
terraces
in
sun
and
shadow
shelves
one
could
rest
a
knee
on
getting
up
with
depths
behind
him
sheer
a
hundred
feet
or
turn
and
sit
on
and
look
out
and
down
with
little
ferns
in
crevices
at
his
elbow
as
to
that
i
ca
say
but
there
the
spring
right
on
the
summit
almost
like
a
fountain
that
ought
to
be
worth
seeing
if
it
there
you
never
saw
it
i
guess
there
no
doubt
about
its
being
there
i
never
saw
it
it
may
not
be
right
on
the
very
top
it
would
have
to
be
a
long
way
down
to
have
some
head
of
water
from
above
and
a
good
distance
down
might
not
be
noticed
by
anyone
who
come
a
long
way
up
one
time
i
asked
a
fellow
climbing
it
to
look
and
tell
me
later
how
it
was
what
did
he
say
he
said
there
was
a
lake
somewhere
in
ireland
on
a
mountain
top
but
a
lake
different
what
about
the
spring
he
never
got
up
high
enough
to
see
that
why
i
do
advise
your
trying
this
side
he
tried
this
side
i
always
meant
to
go
and
look
myself
but
you
know
how
it
is
it
does
seem
so
much
to
climb
a
mountain
you
worked
around
the
foot
of
all
your
life
what
would
i
do
go
in
my
overalls
with
a
big
stick
the
same
as
when
the
cows
have
come
down
to
the
bars
at
milking
time
or
with
a
shotgun
for
a
stray
black
bear
seem
real
to
climb
for
climbing
it
i
should
climb
it
if
i
did
want
to
not
for
the
sake
of
climbing
what
its
name
we
call
it
hor
i
do
know
if
that
right
can
one
walk
around
it
would
it
be
too
far
you
can
drive
round
and
keep
in
lunenburg
but
it
as
much
as
ever
you
can
do
the
boundary
lines
keep
in
so
close
to
it
hor
is
the
township
and
the
township
hor
and
a
few
houses
sprinkled
round
the
foot
like
boulders
broken
off
the
upper
cliff
rolled
out
a
little
farther
than
the
rest
warm
in
december
cold
in
june
you
say
i
do
suppose
the
water
changed
at
all
you
and
i
know
enough
to
know
it
warm
compared
with
cold
and
cold
compared
with
warm
but
all
the
fun
in
how
you
say
a
thing
you
lived
here
all
your
life
ever
since
hor
was
no
bigger
than
a
what
i
did
not
hear
he
drew
the
oxen
toward
him
with
light
touches
of
his
slim
goad
on
nose
and
offside
flank
gave
them
their
marching
orders
and
was
moving
a
hundred
collars
lancaster
bore
him
such
a
little
town
such
a
great
man
it
does
see
him
often
of
late
years
though
he
keeps
the
old
homestead
and
sends
the
children
down
there
with
their
mother
to
run
wild
in
the
summer
a
little
wild
sometimes
he
joins
them
for
a
day
or
two
and
sees
old
friends
he
somehow
ca
get
near
they
meet
him
in
the
general
store
at
night
with
formidable
mail
rifling
a
printed
letter
as
he
talks
they
seem
afraid
he
would
have
it
so
though
a
great
scholar
he
a
democrat
if
not
at
heart
at
least
on
principle
lately
when
coming
up
to
lancaster
his
train
being
late
he
missed
another
train
and
had
four
hours
to
wait
at
woodsville
junction
after
eleven
at
night
too
tired
to
think
of
sitting
such
an
ordeal
out
he
turned
to
the
hotel
to
find
a
bed
no
room
the
night
clerk
said
unless
woodsville
a
place
of
shrieks
and
wandering
lamps
and
cars
that
shook
and
rattle
and
one
hotel
you
say
unless
you
would
mind
sharing
a
room
with
someone
else
who
is
it
a
man
so
i
should
hope
what
kind
of
man
i
know
him
he
all
right
a
man
a
man
separate
beds
of
course
you
understand
the
night
clerk
blinked
his
eyes
and
dared
him
on
who
that
man
sleeping
in
the
office
chair
has
he
had
the
refusal
of
my
chance
he
was
afraid
of
being
robbed
or
murdered
what
do
you
say
i
have
to
have
a
bed
the
night
clerk
led
him
up
three
flights
of
stairs
and
down
a
narrow
passage
full
of
doors
at
the
last
one
of
which
he
knocked
and
entered
lafe
here
a
fellow
wants
to
share
your
room
show
him
this
way
i
not
afraid
of
him
i
not
so
drunk
i
ca
take
care
of
myself
the
night
clerk
clapped
a
bedstead
on
the
foot

mind
to
ask
the
first
man
that
knew
anything
i
happened
in
with
i
ask
you
later
do
let
me
forget
it
the
doctor
looked
at
lafe
and
looked
away
a
man
a
brute
naked
above
the
waist
he
sat
there
creased
and
shining
in
the
light
fumbling
the
buttons
in
a
shirt
i
moving
into
a
shirt
i
felt
mean
lately
mean
no
name
for
it
i
just
found
what
the
matter
was
i
been
like
a
nursery
tree
when
it
outgrows
the
wire
band
of
its
name
tag
i
blamed
it
on
the
hot
spell

my
foolish
hanging
back

liking
to
own

a
size

his
throat
convulsively
oh

say
so
i
can
remember
when
i
wore
fourteen
and
come
to
think
i
must
have

than
a
hundred
collars

bad
to
waste
them

ought
to
have
them

act
as
if
you
wished
you
had
come
sit
down
or
lie
down
friend

make
me
nervous
the
doctor
made
a
subdued
dash
for
it
and
propped
himself
at
bay
against
a
pillow
not
that
way
with
your
shoes
on
kike

bed

a
professor

of
who

more
to
lose
than

be
wrong

wants
to
cut
your
number
fourteen

in
bow
you

the
weekly
news
known

since
i
was
young
then
you
know
me
now
we
are
getting
on
together
talking
i
sort
of
something
for
it
at
the
front
my
business
is
to
find
what
people
want
they
pay
for
it
and
so
they
ought
to
have
it
fairbanks
he
says
to
me
he
editor
feel
out
the
public
sentiment
he
says
a
good
deal
comes
on
me
when
all
is
said
the
only
trouble
is
we
disagree
in
politics
i
vermont
democrat
you
know
what
that
is
sort
of
the
news
has
always
been
republican
fairbanks
he
says
to
me
us
this
year
meaning
by
us
their
ticket
i
says
ca
and
wo
you
been
in
long
enough
it
time
you
turned
around
and
boosted
us

pay
me
more
than
ten
a
week
if
i
expected
to
elect
bill
taft
i
doubt
if
i
could
do
it
anyway
you
seem
to
shape
the
paper
policy
you
see
i
in
with
everybody
know
all
i
almost
know
their
farms
as
well
as
they
do
you
drive
around
it
must
be
pleasant
work
it
business
but
i
ca
say
it
not
fun
what
i
like
best
the
lay
of
different
farms
coming
out
on
them
from
a
stretch
of
woods
or
over
a
hill
or
round
a
sudden
corner
i
like
to
find
folks
getting
out
in
spring
raking
the
dooryard
working
near
the
house
later
they
get
out
further
in
the
fields
everything
shut
sometimes
except
the
barn
the
family
all
away
in
some
back
meadow
there
a
hay
load
when
it
comes
and
later
still
they
all
get
driven
in
the
fields
are
stripped
to
lawn
the
garden
patches
stripped
to
bare
ground
the
apple
trees
to
whips
and
poles
there
nobody
about
the
chimney
though
keeps
up
a
good
brisk
smoking
and
i
lie
back
and
ride
i
take
the
reins
only
when
someone
coming
and
the
mare
stops
when
she
likes
i
tell
her
when
to
go
i
spoiled
jemima
in
more
ways
than
one
she
got
so
she
turns
in
at
every
house
as
if
she
had
some
sort
of
curvature
no
matter
if
i
have
no
errand
there
she
thinks
i
sociable
i
maybe
am
it
seldom
i
get
down
except
for
meals
though
folks
entertain
me
from
the
kitchen
doorstep
all
in
a
family
row
down
to
the
youngest
one
would
suppose
they
might
not
be
as
glad
to
see
you
as
you
are
to
see
them
oh
because
i
want
their
dollar
i
do
want
anything
they
not
got
i
never
dun
i
there
and
they
can
pay
me
if
they
like
i
go
nowhere
on
purpose
i
happen
by
sorry
there
is
no
cup
to
give
you
a
drink
i
drink
out
of
the
bottle
not
your
style
may
i
offer
you
no
no
no
thank
you
just
as
you
say
here
looking
at
you
and
now
i
leaving
you
a
little
while
you
rest
easier
when
i
gone
perhaps
lie
down
let
yourself
go
and
get
some
sleep
but
first
let
see
what
was
i
going
to
ask
you
those
collars
who
shall
i
address
them
to
suppose
you
are
awake
when
i
come
back
really
friend
i
ca
let
you
you
may
need
them
not
till
i
shrink
when
they
be
out
of
style
but
really
i
i
have
so
many
collars
i
do
know
who
i
rather
would
have
have
them
they
only
turning
yellow
where
they
are
but
you
the
doctor
as
the
saying
is
i
put
the
light
out
do
you
wait
for
me
i
just
begun
the
night
you
get
some
sleep
i
knock
and
peep
round
the
door
when
i
come
back
so
you
know
who
it
is
there
nothing
i
afraid
of
like
scared
people
i
do
want
you
should
shoot
me
in
the
head
what
am
i
doing
carrying
off
this
bottle
there
now
you
get
some
sleep
he
shut
the
door
the
doctor
slid
a
little
down
the
pillow
home
burial
he
saw
her
from
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
before
she
saw
him
she
was
starting
down
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
at
some
fear
she
took
a
doubtful
step
and
then
undid
it
to
raise
herself
and
look
again
he
spoke
advancing
toward
her
what
is
it
you
see
from
up
there
always
for
i
want
to
know
she
turned
and
sank
upon
her
skirts
at
that
and
her
face
changed
from
terrified
to
dull
he
said
to
gain
time
what
is
it
you
see
mounting
until
she
cowered
under
him
i
will
find
out
now
you
must
tell
me
dear
she
in
her
place
refused
him
any
help
with
the
least
stiffening
of
her
neck
and
silence
she
let
him
look
sure
that
he
would
see
blind
creature
and
a
while
he
did
see
but
at
last
he
murmured
oh
and
again
oh
what
is
it
what
she
said
just
that
i
see
you
do
she
challenged
tell
me
what
it
is
the
wonder
is
i
did
see
at
once
i
never
noticed
it
from
here
before
i
must
be
wonted
to
it
that
the
reason
the
little
graveyard
where
my
people
are
so
small
the
window
frames
the
whole
of
it
not
so
much
larger
than
a
bedroom
is
it
there
are
three
stones
of
slate
and
one
of
marble
little
slabs
there
in
the
sunlight
on
the
sidehill
we
have
to
mind
those
but
i
understand
it
is
not
the
stones
but
the
child
mound
do
do
do
do
she
cried
she
withdrew
shrinking
from
beneath
his
arm
that
rested
on
the
banister
and
slid
downstairs
and
turned
on
him
with
such
a
daunting
look
he
said
twice
over
before
he
knew
himself
ca
a
man
speak
of
his
own
child
he
lost
not
you
oh
where
my
hat
oh
i
do
need
it
i
must
get
out
of
here
i
must
get
air
i
do
know
rightly
whether
any
man
can
amy
do
go
to
someone
else
this
time
listen
to
me
i
wo
come
down
the
stairs
he
sat
and
fixed
his
chin
between
his
fists
there
something
i
should
like
to
ask
you
dear
you
do
know
how
to
ask
it
help
me
then
her
fingers
moved
the
latch
for
all
reply
my
words
are
nearly
always
an
offence
i
do
know
how
to
speak
of
anything
so
as
to
please
you
but
i
might
be
taught
i
should
suppose
i
ca
say
i
see
how
a
man
must
partly
give
up
being
a
man
with
we
could
have
some
arrangement
by
which
i
bind
myself
to
keep
hands
off
anything
special
you
to
name
though
i
do
like
such
things
those
that
love
two
that
do
love
ca
live
together
without
them
but
two
that
do
ca
live
together
with
them
she
moved
the
latch
a
little
do
do
go
do
carry
it
to
someone
else
this
time
tell
me
about
it
if
it
something
human
let
me
into
your
grief
i
not
so
much
unlike
other
folks
as
your
standing
there
apart
would
make
me
out
give
me
my
chance
i
do
think
though
you
overdo
it
a
little
what
was
it
brought
you
up
to
think
it
the
thing
to
take
your
of
a
first
child
so
inconsolably
in
the
face
of
love
you
think
his
memory
might
be
satisfied
there
you
go
sneering
now
i
not
i
not
you
make
me
angry
i
come
down
to
you
god
what
a
woman
and
it
come
to
this
a
man
ca
speak
of
his
own
child
that
dead
you
ca
because
you
do
know
how
if
you
had
any
feelings
you
that
dug
with
your
own
hand
how
could
you
his
little
grave
i
saw
you
from
that
very
window
there
making
the
gravel
leap
and
leap
in
air
leap
up
like
that
like
that
and
land
so
lightly
and
roll
back
down
the
mound
beside
the
hole
i
thought
who
is
that
man
i
did
know
you
and
i
crept
down
the
stairs
and
up
the
stairs
to
look
again
and
still
your
spade
kept
lifting
then
you
came
in
i
heard
your
rumbling
voice
out
in
the
kitchen
and
i
do
know
why
but
i
went
near
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
you
could
sit
there
with
the
stains
on
your
shoes
of
the
fresh
earth
from
your
own
baby
grave
and
talk
about
your
everyday
concerns
you
had
stood
the
spade
up
against
the
wall
outside
there
in
the
entry
for
i
saw
it
i
shall
laugh
the
worst
laugh
i
ever
laughed
i
cursed
god
if
i
do
believe
i
cursed
i
can
repeat
the
very
words
you
were
saying
foggy
mornings
and
one
rainy
day
will
rot
the
best
birch
fence
a
man
can
build
think
of
it
talk
like
that
at
such
a
time
what
had
how
long
it
takes
a
birch
to
rot
to
do
with
what
was
in
the
darkened
parlour
you
could
care
the
nearest
friends
can
go
with
anyone
to
death
comes
so
far
short
they
might
as
well
not
try
to
go
at
all
no
from
the
time
when
one
is
sick
to
death
one
is
alone
and
he
dies
more
alone
friends
make
pretence
of
following
to
the
grave
but
before
one
is
in
it
their
minds
are
turned
and
making
the
best
of
their
way
back
to
life
and
living
people
and
things
they
understand
but
the
world
evil
i
wo
have
grief
so
if
i
can
change
it
oh
i
wo
i
wo
there
you
have
said
it
all
and
you
feel
better
you
wo
go
now
you
crying
close
the
door
the
heart
gone
out
of
it
why
keep
it
up
amy
there
someone
coming
down
the
road
you
oh
you
think
the
talk
is
all
i
must
go
somewhere
out
of
this
house
how
can
i
make
you
if
you
do
she
was
opening
the
door
wider
where
do
you
mean
to
go
first
tell
me
that
i
follow
and
bring
you
back
by
force
i
will
the
black
cottage
we
chanced
in
passing
by
that
afternoon
to
catch
it
in
a
sort
of
special
picture
among
ancient
cherry
trees
set
well
back
from
the
road
in
rank
lodged
grass
the
little
cottage
we
were
speaking
of
a
front
with
just
a
door
between
two
windows
fresh
painted
by
the
shower
a
velvet
black
we
paused
the
minister
and
i
to
look
he
made
as
if
to
hold
it
at
arm
length
or
put
the
leaves
aside
that
framed
it
in
pretty
he
said
come
in
no
one
will
care
the
path
was
a
vague
parting
in
the
grass
that
led
us
to
a
weathered
we
pressed
our
faces
to
the
pane
you
see
he
said
everything
as
she
left
it
when
she
died
her
sons
wo
sell
the
house
or
the
things
in
it
they
say
they
mean
to
come
and
summer
here
where
they
were
boys
they
have
come
this
year
they
live
so
far
away
one
is
out
west
it
will
be
hard
for
them
to
keep
their
word
anyway
they
wo
have
the
place
disturbed
a
buttoned
lounge
spread
scrolling
arms
under
a
crayon
portrait
on
the
wall
done
sadly
from
an
old
daguerreotype
that
was
the
father
as
he
went
to
war
she
always
when
she
talked
about
war
sooner
or
later
came
and
leaned
half
knelt
against
the
lounge
beside
it
though
i
doubt
if
such
unlifelike
lines
kept
power
to
stir
anything
in
her
after
all
the
years
he
fell
at
gettysburg
or
fredericksburg
i
ought
to
know
it
makes
a
difference
which
fredericksburg
was
gettysburg
of
course
but
what
i
getting
to
is
how
forsaken
a
little
cottage
this
has
always
seemed
since
she
went
more
than
ever
but
before
i
do
mean
altogether
by
the
lives
that
had
gone
out
of
it
the
father
first
then
the
two
sons
till
she
was
left
alone
nothing
could
draw
her
after
those
two
sons
she
valued
the
considerate
neglect
she
had
at
some
cost
taught
them
after
years
i
mean
by
the
world
having
passed
it
by
as
we
almost
got
by
this
afternoon
it
always
seems
to
me
a
sort
of
mark
to
measure
how
far
fifty
years
have
brought
us
why
not
sit
down
if
you
are
in
no
haste
these
doorsteps
seldom
have
a
visitor
the
warping
boards
pull
out
their
own
old
nails
with
none
to
tread
and
put
them
in
their
place
she
had
her
own
idea
of
things
the
old
lady
and
she
liked
talk
she
had
seen
garrison
and
whittier
and
had
her
story
of
them
one
was
long
in
learning
that
she
thought
whatever
else
the
civil
war
was
for
it
was
just
to
keep
the
states
together
nor
just
to
free
the
slaves
though
it
did
both
she
would
have
believed
those
ends
enough
to
have
given
outright
for
them
all
she
gave
her
giving
somehow
touched
the
principle
that
all
men
are
created
free
and
equal
and
to
hear
her
quaint
phrases
so
removed
from
the
world
view
of
all
those
things
that
a
hard
mystery
of
jefferson
what
did
he
mean
of
course
the
easy
way
is
to
decide
it
simply
is
true
it
may
not
be
i
heard
a
fellow
say
so
but
never
mind
the
welshman
got
it
planted
where
it
will
trouble
us
a
thousand
years
each
age
will
have
to
reconsider
it
you
could
tell
her
what
the
west
was
saying
and
what
the
south
to
her
serene
belief
she
had
some
art
of
hearing
and
yet
not
hearing
the
latter
wisdom
of
the
world
white
was
the
only
race
she
ever
knew
black
she
had
scarcely
seen
and
yellow
never
but
how
could
they
be
made
so
very
unlike
by
the
same
hand
working
in
the
same
stuff
she
had
supposed
the
war
decided
that
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
such
a
person
strange
how
such
innocence
gets
its
own
way
i
should
be
surprised
if
in
this
world
it
were
the
force
that
would
at
last
prevail
do
you
know
but
for
her
there
was
a
time
when
to
please
younger
members
of
the
church
or
rather
say
in
the
church
whom
we
all
have
to
think
of
nowadays
i
would
have
changed
the
creed
a
very
little
not
that
she
ever
had
to
ask
me
not
to
it
never
got
so
far
as
that
but
the
bare
thought
of
her
old
tremulous
bonnet
in
the
pew
and
of
her
half
asleep
was
too
much
for
me
why
i
might
wake
her
up
and
startle
her
it
was
the
words
into
that
seemed
too
pagan
to
our
liberal
youth
you
know
they
suffered
from
a
general
onslaught
and
well
if
they
were
true
why
keep
right
on
saying
them
like
the
heathen
we
could
drop
them
only
there
was
the
bonnet
in
the
pew
such
a
phrase
could
have
meant
much
to
her
but
suppose
she
had
missed
it
from
the
creed
as
a
child
misses
the
unsaid
and
falls
asleep
with
heartache
how
should
i
feel
i
just
as
glad
she
made
me
keep
hands
off
for
dear
me
why
abandon
a
belief
merely
because
it
ceases
to
be
true
cling
to
it
long
enough
and
not
a
doubt
it
will
turn
true
again
for
so
it
goes
most
of
the
change
we
think
we
see
in
life
is
due
to
truths
being
in
and
out
of
favour
as
i
sit
here
and
oftentimes
i
wish
i
could
be
monarch
of
a
desert
land
i
could
devote
and
dedicate
forever
to
the
truths
we
keep
coming
back
and
back
to
so
desert
it
would
have
to
be
so
walled
by
mountain
ranges
half
in
summer
snow
no
one
would
covet
it
or
think
it
worth
the
pains
of
conquering
to
force
change
on
scattered
oases
where
men
dwelt
but
mostly
sand
dunes
held
loosely
in
tamarisk
blown
over
and
over
themselves
in
idleness
sand
grains
should
sugar
in
the
natal
dew
the
babe
born
to
the
desert
the
sand
storm
retard
my
cowering
caravans
there
are
bees
in
this
wall
he
struck
the
clapboards
fierce
heads
looked
out
small
bodies
pivoted
we
rose
to
go
sunset
blazed
on
the
windows
blueberries
you
ought
to
have
seen
what
i
saw
on
my
way
to
the
village
through
mortenson
pasture
blueberries
as
big
as
the
end
of
your
thumb
real
and
heavy
and
ready
to
drum
in
the
cavernous
pail
of
the
first
one
to
come
and
all
ripe
together
not
some
of
them
green
and
some
of
them
ripe
you
ought
to
have
seen
i
do
know
what
part
of
the
pasture
you
mean
you
know
where
they
cut
off
the
woods
let
me
see
it
was
two
years
ago
or
no
can
it
be
no
longer
than
that
and
the
following
fall
the
fire
ran
and
burned
it
all
up
but
the
wall
why
there
has
been
time
for
the
bushes
to
grow
that
always
the
way
with
the
blueberries
though
there
may
not
have
been
the
ghost
of
a
sign
of
them
anywhere
under
the
shade
of
the
pine
but
get
the
pine
out
of
the
way
you
may
burn
the
pasture
all
over
until
not
a
fern
or
is
left
not
to
mention
a
stick
and
presto
they
up
all
around
you
as
thick
and
hard
to
explain
as
a
conjuror
trick
it
must
be
on
charcoal
they
fatten
their
fruit
i
taste
in
them
sometimes
the
flavour
of
soot
and
after
all
really
they
ebony
skinned
the
blue
but
a
mist
from
the
breath
of
the
wind
a
tarnish
that
goes
at
a
touch
of
the
hand
and
less
than
the
tan
with
which
pickers
are
tanned
does
mortenson
know
what
he
has
do
you
think
he
may
and
not
care
and
so
leave
the
chewink
to
gather
them
for
him
you
know
what
he
is
he
wo
make
the
fact
that
they
rightfully
his
an
excuse
for
keeping
us
other
folk
out
i
wonder
you
did
see
loren
about
the
best
of
it
was
that
i
did
do
you
know
i
was
just
getting
through
what
the
field
had
to
show
and
over
the
wall
and
into
the
road
when
who
should
come
by
with
a
of
all
the
young
chattering
lorens
alive
but
loren
the
fatherly
out
for
a
drive
he
saw
you
then
what
did
he
do
did
he
frown
he
just
kept
nodding
his
head
up
and
down
you
know
how
politely
he
always
goes
by
but
he
thought
a
big
thought
i
could
tell
by
his
eye
which
being
expressed
might
be
this
in
effect
have
left
those
there
berries
i
shrewdly
suspect
to
ripen
too
long
i
am
greatly
to
blame
he
a
thriftier
person
than
some
i
could
name
he
seems
to
be
thrifty
and
has
he
need
with
the
mouths
of
all
those
young
lorens
to
feed
he
has
brought
them
all
up
on
wild
berries
they
say
like
birds
they
store
a
great
many
away
they
eat
them
the
year
round
and
those
they
do
eat
they
sell
in
the
store
and
buy
shoes
for
their
feet
who
cares
what
they
say
it
a
nice
way
to
live
just
taking
what
nature
is
willing
to
give
not
forcing
her
hand
with
harrow
and
plow
i
wish
you
had
seen
his
perpetual
bow
and
the
air
of
the
youngsters
not
one
of
them
turned
and
they
looked
so
concerned
i
wish
i
knew
half
what
the
flock
of
them
know
of
where
all
the
berries
and
other
things
grow
cranberries
in
bogs
and
raspberries
on
top
of
the
mountain
and
when
they
will
crop
i
met
them
one
day
and
each
had
a
flower
stuck
into
his
berries
as
fresh
as
a
shower
some
strange
kind
they
told
me
it
had
a
name
i
told
you
how
once
not
long
after
we
came
i
almost
provoked
poor
loren
to
mirth
by
going
to
him
of
all
people
on
earth
to
ask
if
he
knew
any
fruit
to
be
had
for
the
picking
the
rascal
he
said
he
be
glad
to
tell
if
he
knew
but
the
year
had
been
bad
there
had
been
some
berries
but
those
were
all
gone
he
did
say
where
they
had
been
he
went
on
sure
i
sure
as
polite
as
could
be
he
spoke
to
his
wife
in
the
door
me
see
mame
we
do
know
any
good
berrying
place
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
a
straight
face
if
he
thinks
all
the
fruit
that
grows
wild
is
for
him
he
find
he
mistaken
see
here
for
a
whim
we
pick
in
the
mortensons
pasture
this
year
we
go
in
the
morning
that
is
if
it
clear
and
the
sun
shines
out
warm
the
vines
must
be
wet
it
so
long
since
i
picked
i
almost
forget
how
we
used
to
pick
berries
we
took
one
look
round
then
sank
out
of
sight
like
trolls
underground
and
saw
nothing
more
of
each
other
or
heard
unless
when
you
said
i
was
keeping
a
bird
away
from
its
nest
and
i
said
it
was
you
one
of
us
is
for
complaining
it
flew
around
and
around
us
and
then
for
a
while
we
picked
till
i
feared
you
had
wandered
a
mile
and
i
thought
i
had
lost
you
i
lifted
a
shout
too
loud
for
the
distance
you
were
it
turned
out
for
when
you
made
answer
your
voice
was
as
low
as
talking
you
stood
up
beside
me
you
know
we
have
the
place
to
ourselves
to
enjoy
not
likely
when
all
the
young
lorens
deploy
they
be
there
or
even
they
wo
be
too
friendly
they
may
be
polite
to
people
they
look
on
as
having
no
right
to
pick
where
they
picking
but
we
wo
complain
you
ought
to
have
seen
how
it
looked
in
the
rain
the
fruit
mixed
with
water
in
layers
of
leaves
like
two
kinds
of
jewels
a
vision
for
thieves
a
servant
to
servants
i
did
make
you
know
how
glad
i
was
to
have
you
come
and
camp
here
on
our
land
i
promised
myself
to
get
down
some
day
and
see
the
way
you
lived
but
i
do
know
with
a
houseful
of
hungry
men
to
feed
i
guess
you
find
it
seems
to
me
i
ca
express
my
feelings
any
more
than
i
can
raise
my
voice
or
want
to
lift
my
hand
oh
i
can
lift
it
when
i
have
to
did
ever
you
feel
so
i
hope
you
never
it
got
so
i
do
even
know
for
sure
whether
i
am
glad
sorry
or
anything
there
nothing
but
a
left
inside
that
seems
to
tell
me
how
i
ought
to
feel
and
would
feel
if
i
was
all
gone
wrong
you
take
the
lake
i
look
and
look
at
it
i
see
it
a
fair
pretty
sheet
of
water
i
stand
and
make
myself
repeat
out
loud
the
advantages
it
has
so
long
and
narrow
like
a
deep
piece
of
some
old
running
river
cut
short
off
at
both
ends
it
lies
five
miles
straight
away
through
the
mountain
notch
from
the
sink
window
where
i
wash
the
plates
and
all
our
storms
come
up
toward
the
house
drawing
the
slow
waves
whiter
and
whiter
and
whiter
it
took
my
mind
off
doughnuts
and
soda
biscuit
to
step
outdoors
and
take
the
water
dazzle
a
sunny
morning
or
take
the
rising
wind
about
my
face
and
body
and
through
my
wrapper
when
a
storm
threatened
from
the
dragon
den
and
a
cold
chill
shivered
across
the
lake
i
see
it
a
fair
pretty
sheet
of
water
our
willoughby
how
did
you
hear
of
it
i
expect
though
everyone
heard
of
it
in
a
book
about
ferns
listen
to
that
you
let
things
more
like
feathers
regulate
your
going
and
coming
and
you
like
it
here
i
can
see
how
you
might
but
i
do
know
it
would
be
different
if
more
people
came
for
then
there
would
be
business
as
it
is
the
cottages
len
built
sometimes
we
rent
them
sometimes
we
do
we
a
good
piece
of
shore
that
ought
to
be
worth
something
and
may
yet
but
i
do
count
on
it
as
much
as
len
he
looks
on
the
bright
side
of
everything
including
me
he
thinks
i
be
all
right
with
doctoring
but
it
not
medicine
lowe
is
the
only
doctor
dared
to
say
so
it
rest
i
want
there
i
have
said
it
out
from
cooking
meals
for
hungry
hired
men
and
washing
dishes
after
them
from
doing
things
over
and
over
that
just
wo
stay
done
by
good
rights
i
ought
not
to
have
so
much
put
on
me
but
there
seems
no
other
way
len
says
one
steady
pull
more
ought
to
do
it
he
says
the
best
way
out
is
always
through
and
i
agree
to
that
or
in
so
far
as
that
i
can
see
no
way
out
but
through
leastways
for
me
and
then
they
be
convinced
it
not
that
len
do
want
the
best
for
me
it
was
his
plan
our
moving
over
in
beside
the
lake
from
where
that
day
i
showed
you
we
used
to
live
ten
miles
from
anywhere
we
did
change
without
some
sacrifice
but
len
went
at
it
to
make
up
the
loss
his
work
a
man
of
course
from
sun
to
sun
but
he
works
when
he
works
as
hard
as
i
do
though
there
small
profit
in
comparisons
women
and
men
will
make
them
all
the
same
but
work
ai
all
len
undertakes
too
much
he
into
everything
in
town
this
year
it
highways
and
he
got
too
many
men
around
him
to
look
after
that
make
waste
they
take
advantage
of
him
shamefully
and
proud
too
of
themselves
for
doing
so
we
have
four
here
to
board
great
sprawling
about
the
kitchen
with
their
talk
while
i
fry
their
bacon
much
they
care
no
more
put
out
in
what
they
do
or
say
than
if
i
was
in
the
room
at
all
coming
and
going
all
the
time
they
are
i
do
learn
what
their
names
are
let
alone
their
characters
or
whether
they
are
safe
to
have
inside
the
house
with
doors
unlocked
i
not
afraid
of
them
though
if
they
not
afraid
of
me
there
two
can
play
at
that
i
have
my
fancies
it
runs
in
the
family
my
father
brother
was
right
they
kept
him
locked
up
for
years
back
there
at
the
old
farm
i
been
away
once
yes
i
been
away
the
state
asylum
i
was
prejudiced
i
would
have
sent
anyone
of
mine
there
you
know
the
old
idea
the
only
asylum
was
the
poorhouse
and
those
who
could
afford
rather
than
send
their
folks
to
such
a
place
kept
them
at
home
and
it
does
seem
more
human
but
it
not
so
the
place
is
the
asylum
there
they
have
every
means
proper
to
do
with
and
you
are
darkening
other
people
lives
worse
than
no
good
to
them
and
they
no
good
to
you
in
your
condition
you
ca
know
affection
or
the
want
of
it
in
that
state
i
heard
too
much
of
the
way
my
father
brother
he
went
mad
quite
young
some
thought
he
had
been
bitten
by
a
dog
because
his
violence
took
on
the
form
of
carrying
his
pillow
in
his
teeth
but
it
more
likely
he
was
crossed
in
love
or
so
the
story
goes
it
was
some
girl
anyway
all
he
talked
about
was
love
they
soon
saw
he
would
do
someone
a
mischief
if
he
kept
strict
watch
of
and
it
ended
in
father
building
him
a
sort
of
cage
or
room
within
a
room
of
hickory
poles
like
stanchions
in
the
barn
from
floor
to
ceiling
a
narrow
passage
all
the
way
around
anything
they
put
in
for
furniture
he
tear
to
pieces
even
a
bed
to
lie
on
so
they
made
the
place
comfortable
with
straw
like
a
beast
stall
to
ease
their
consciences
of
course
they
had
to
feed
him
without
dishes
they
tried
to
keep
him
clothed
but
he
paraded
with
his
clothes
on
his
arm
all
of
his
clothes
cruel
it
sounds
i
they
did
the
best
they
knew
and
just
when
he
was
at
the
height
father
and
mother
married
and
mother
came
a
bride
to
help
take
care
of
such
a
creature
and
accommodate
her
young
life
to
his
that
was
what
marrying
father
meant
to
her
she
had
to
lie
and
hear
love
things
made
dreadful
by
his
shouts
in
the
night
he
shout
and
shout
until
the
strength
was
shouted
out
of
him
and
his
voice
died
down
slowly
from
exhaustion
he
pull
his
bars
apart
like
bow
and
and
let
them
go
and
make
them
twang
until
his
hands
had
worn
them
smooth
as
any
and
then
he
crow
as
if
he
thought
that
child
play
the
only
fun
he
had
i
heard
them
say
though
they
found
a
way
to
put
a
stop
to
it
he
was
before
my
time
i
never
saw
him
but
the
pen
stayed
exactly
as
it
was
there
in
the
upper
chamber
in
the
ell
a
sort
of
full
of
attic
clutter
i
often
think
of
the
smooth
hickory
bars
it
got
so
i
would
say
you
know
half
fooling
it
time
i
took
my
turn
upstairs
in
jail
just
as
you
will
till
it
becomes
a
habit
no
wonder
i
was
glad
to
get
away
mind
you
i
waited
till
len
said
the
word
i
did
want
the
blame
if
things
went
wrong
i
was
glad
though
no
end
when
we
moved
out
and
i
looked
to
be
happy
and
i
was
as
i
said
for
a
while
but
i
do
know
somehow
the
change
wore
out
like
a
prescription
and
there
more
to
it
than
just
and
living
by
a
lake
i
past
such
help
unless
len
took
the
notion
which
he
wo
and
i
wo
ask
him
it
not
sure
enough
i
i
got
to
go
the
road
i
going
other
folks
have
to
and
why
should
i
i
almost
think
if
i
could
do
like
you
drop
everything
and
live
out
on
the
ground
but
it
might
be
come
night
i
should
like
it
or
a
long
rain
i
should
soon
get
enough
and
be
glad
of
a
good
roof
overhead
i
lain
awake
thinking
of
you
i
warrant
more
than
you
have
yourself
some
of
these
nights
the
wonder
was
the
tents
were
snatched
away
from
over
you
as
you
lay
in
your
beds
i
have
courage
for
a
risk
like
that
bless
you
of
course
you
keeping
me
from
work
but
the
thing
of
it
is
i
need
to
be
kept
there
work
enough
to
do
there
always
that
but
behind
behind
the
worst
that
you
can
do
is
set
me
back
a
little
more
behind
i
catch
up
in
this
world
anyway
i
rather
you
not
go
unless
you
must
after
my
long
ladder
sticking
through
a
tree
toward
heaven
still
and
there
a
barrel
that
i
did
fill
beside
it
and
there
may
be
two
or
three
apples
i
did
pick
upon
some
bough
but
i
am
done
with
now
essence
of
winter
sleep
is
on
the
night
the
scent
of
apples
i
am
drowsing
off
i
can
not
rub
the
strangeness
from
my
sight
i
got
from
looking
through
a
pane
of
glass
i
skimmed
this
morning
from
the
drinking
trough
and
held
against
the
world
of
hoary
grass
it
melted
and
i
let
it
fall
and
break
but
i
was
well
upon
my
way
to
sleep
before
it
fell
and
i
could
tell
what
form
my
dreaming
was
about
to
take
magnified
apples
appear
and
disappear
stem
end
and
blossom
end
and
every
fleck
of
russet
showing
clear
my
instep
arch
not
only
keeps
the
ache
it
keeps
the
pressure
of
a
i
feel
the
ladder
sway
as
the
boughs
bend
and
i
keep
hearing
from
the
cellar
bin
the
rumbling
sound
of
load
on
load
of
apples
coming
in
for
i
have
had
too
much
of
i
am
overtired
of
the
great
harvest
i
myself
desired
there
were
ten
thousand
thousand
fruit
to
touch
cherish
in
hand
lift
down
and
not
let
fall
for
all
that
struck
the
earth
no
matter
if
not
bruised
or
spiked
with
stubble
went
surely
to
the
heap
as
of
no
worth
one
can
see
what
will
trouble
this
sleep
of
mine
whatever
sleep
it
is
were
he
not
gone
the
woodchuck
could
say
whether
it
like
his
long
sleep
as
i
describe
its
coming
on
or
just
some
human
sleep
the
code
there
were
three
in
the
meadow
by
the
brook
gathering
up
windrows
piling
cocks
of
hay
with
an
eye
always
lifted
toward
the
west
where
an
irregular
cloud
darkly
advanced
with
a
perpetual
dagger
flickering
across
its
bosom
suddenly
one
helper
thrusting
pitchfork
in
the
ground
marched
himself
off
the
field
and
home
one
stayed
the
farmer
failed
to
understand
what
is
there
wrong
something
you
just
now
said
what
did
i
say
about
our
taking
pains
to
cock
the
hay
because
it
going
to
shower
i
said
that
more
than
half
an
hour
ago
i
said
it
to
myself
as
much
as
you
you
did
know
but
james
is
one
big
fool
he
thought
you
meant
to
find
fault
with
his
work
that
what
the
average
farmer
would
have
meant
james
would
take
time
of
course
to
chew
it
over
before
he
acted
he
just
got
round
to
act
he
is
a
fool
if
that
the
way
he
takes
me
do
let
it
bother
you
you
found
out
something
the
hand
that
knows
his
business
wo
be
told
to
do
work
better
or
faster
those
two
things
i
as
particular
as
anyone
most
likely
i
have
served
you
just
the
same
but
i
know
you
do
understand
our
ways
you
were
just
talking
what
was
in
your
mind
what
was
in
all
our
minds
and
you
were
hinting
tell
you
a
story
of
what
happened
once
i
was
up
here
in
salem
at
a
named
sanders
with
a
gang
of
four
or
five
doing
the
haying
no
one
liked
the
boss
he
was
one
of
the
kind
sports
call
a
spider
all
wiry
arms
and
legs
that
spread
out
wavy
from
a
humped
body
nigh
as
big
a
biscuit
but
work
that
man
could
work
especially
if
by
so
doing
he
could
get
more
work
out
of
his
hired
help
i
not
denying
he
was
hard
on
himself
i
could
find
that
he
kept
any
hours
not
for
himself
daylight
and
were
one
to
him
i
heard
him
pounding
in
the
barn
all
night
but
what
he
liked
was
someone
to
encourage
them
that
he
could
lead
he
get
behind
and
drive
the
way
you
can
you
know
in
mowing
keep
at
their
heels
and
threaten
to
mow
their
legs
off
i
seen
about
enough
of
his
bulling
tricks
we
call
that
bulling
i
been
watching
him
so
when
he
paired
off
with
me
in
the
hayfield
to
load
the
load
thinks
i
look
out
for
trouble
i
built
the
load
and
topped
it
off
old
sanders
combed
it
down
with
a
rake
and
says
everything
went
well
till
we
reached
the
barn
with
a
big
catch
to
empty
in
a
bay
you
understand
that
meant
the
easy
job
for
the
man
up
on
top
of
throwing
down
the
hay
and
rolling
it
off
wholesale
where
on
a
mow
it
would
have
been
slow
lifting
you
would
think
a
fellow
need
much
urging
under
these
circumstances
would
you
now
but
the
old
fool
seizes
his
fork
in
both
hands
and
looking
up
bewhiskered
out
of
the
pit
shouts
like
an
army
captain
her
come
thinks
i
d
mean
it
was
that
you
said
i
asked
out
loud
so
there
be
no
mistake
you
say
let
her
come
let
her
come
he
said
it
over
but
he
said
it
softer
never
you
say
a
thing
like
that
to
a
man
not
if
he
values
what
he
is
god
i
as
soon
murdered
him
as
left
out
his
middle
name
i
built
the
load
and
knew
right
where
to
find
it
two
or
three
forkfuls
i
picked
lightly
round
for
like
meditating
and
then
i
just
dug
in
and
dumped
the
rackful
on
him
in
ten
lots
i
looked
over
the
side
once
in
the
dust
and
caught
sight
of
him
keeping
his
head
above
ye
i
says
gets
ye
he
squeaked
like
a
squeezed
rat
that
was
the
last
i
saw
or
heard
of
him
i
cleaned
the
rack
and
drove
out
to
cool
off
as
i
sat
mopping
hayseed
from
my
neck
and
sort
of
waiting
to
be
asked
about
it
one
of
the
boys
sings
out
the
old
man
left
him
in
the
barn
under
the
hay
if
ye
want
him
ye
can
go
and
dig
him
out
they
realized
from
the
way
i
swobbed
my
neck
more
than
was
needed
something
must
be
up
they
headed
for
the
barn
i
stayed
where
i
was
they
told
me
afterward
first
they
forked
hay
a
lot
of
it
out
into
the
barn
floor
nothing
they
listened
for
him
not
a
rustle
i
guess
they
thought
i
spiked
him
in
the
temple
before
i
buried
him
or
i
could
have
managed
they
excavated
more
keep
his
wife
out
of
the
barn
someone
looked
in
a
window
and
curse
me
if
he
was
in
the
kitchen
slumped
way
down
in
a
chair
with
both
his
feet
stuck
in
the
oven
the
hottest
day
that
summer
he
looked
so
clean
disgusted
from
behind
there
was
no
one
that
dared
to
stir
him
up
or
let
him
know
that
he
was
being
looked
at
apparently
i
had
buried
him
i
may
have
knocked
him
down
but
my
just
trying
to
bury
him
had
hurt
his
dignity
he
had
gone
to
the
house
so
not
to
meet
me
he
kept
away
from
us
all
afternoon
we
tended
to
his
hay
we
saw
him
out
after
a
while
picking
peas
in
his
garden
he
could
keep
away
from
doing
something
were
you
relieved
to
find
he
was
dead
no
and
yet
i
do
know
it
hard
to
say
i
went
about
to
kill
him
fair
enough
you
took
an
awkward
way
did
he
discharge
you
discharge
me
no
he
knew
i
did
just
right
the
generations
of
men
a
governor
it
was
proclaimed
this
time
when
all
who
would
come
seeking
in
new
hampshire
ancestral
memories
might
come
together
and
those
of
the
name
stark
gathered
in
bow
a
town
where
farming
has
fallen
off
and
flourish
where
the
axe
has
gone
someone
had
literally
run
to
earth
in
an
old
cellar
hole
in
a
the
origin
of
all
the
family
there
thence
they
were
sprung
so
numerous
a
tribe
that
now
not
all
the
houses
left
in
town
made
shift
to
shelter
them
without
the
help
of
here
and
there
a
tent
in
grove
and
orchard
they
were
at
bow
but
that
was
not
enough
nothing
would
do
but
they
must
fix
a
day
to
stand
together
on
the
crater
verge
that
turned
them
on
the
world
and
try
to
fathom
the
past
and
get
some
strangeness
out
of
it
but
rain
spoiled
all
the
day
began
uncertain
with
clouds
low
trailing
and
moments
of
rain
that
misted
the
young
folk
held
some
hope
out
to
each
other
till
well
toward
noon
when
the
storm
settled
down
with
a
swish
in
the
grass
what
if
the
others
are
there
they
said
it
is
going
to
rain
only
one
from
a
farm
not
far
away
strolled
thither
not
expecting
he
would
find
anyone
else
but
out
of
idleness
one
and
one
other
yes
for
there
were
two
the
second
round
the
curving
hillside
road
was
a
girl
and
she
halted
some
way
off
to
reconnoitre
and
then
made
up
her
mind
at
least
to
pass
by
and
see
who
he
was
and
perhaps
hear
some
word
about
the
weather
this
was
some
stark
she
did
know
he
nodded
no
fête
he
said
it
looks
that
way
she
swept
the
heavens
turning
on
her
heel
i
only
idled
down
i
idled
down
provision
there
had
been
for
just
such
meeting
of
stranger
cousins
in
a
family
tree
drawn
on
a
sort
of
passport
with
the
branch
of
the
one
bearing
it
done
in
detail
some
zealous
one
laborious
device
she
made
a
sudden
movement
toward
her
bodice
as
one
who
clasps
her
heart
they
laughed
together
stark
he
inquired
no
matter
for
the
proof
yes
stark
and
you
i
stark
he
drew
his
passport
you
know
we
might
not
be
and
still
be
cousins
the
town
is
full
of
chases
lowes
and
baileys
all
claiming
some
priority
in
starkness
my
mother
was
a
lane
yet
might
have
married
anyone
upon
earth
and
still
her
children
would
have
been
starks
and
doubtless
here
you
riddle
with
your
genealogy
like
a
viola
i
do
follow
you
i
only
mean
my
mother
was
a
stark
several
times
over
and
by
marrying
father
no
more
than
brought
us
back
into
the
name
one
ought
not
to
be
thrown
into
confusion
by
a
plain
statement
of
relationship
but
i
own
what
you
say
makes
my
head
spin
you
take
my
card
you
seem
so
good
at
such
things
and
see
if
you
can
reckon
our
cousinship
why
not
take
seats
here
on
the
cellar
wall
and
dangle
feet
among
the
raspberry
vines
under
the
shelter
of
the
family
tree
just
so
that
ought
to
be
enough
protection
not
from
the
rain
i
think
it
going
to
rain
it
raining
no
it
misting
let
be
fair
does
the
rain
seem
to
you
to
cool
the
eyes
the
situation
was
like
this
the
road
bowed
outward
on
the
mountain
up
and
disappeared
and
ended
not
far
off
no
one
went
home
that
way
the
only
house
beyond
where
they
were
was
a
shattered
seedpod
and
below
roared
a
brook
hidden
in
trees
the
sound
of
which
was
silence
for
the
place
this
he
sat
listening
to
till
she
gave
judgment
on
father
side
it
seems
we
let
me
see
do
be
too
you
have
three
cards
four
cards
one
yours
three
mine
one
for
each
branch
of
the
stark
family
i
a
member
of
know
a
person
so
related
to
herself
is
supposed
to
be
mad
i
may
be
mad
you
look
so
sitting
out
here
in
the
rain
studying
genealogy
with
me
you
never
saw
before
what
will
we
come
to
with
all
this
pride
of
ancestry
we
yankees
i
think
we
all
mad
tell
me
why
we
here
drawn
into
town
about
this
cellar
hole
like
wild
geese
on
a
lake
before
a
storm
what
do
we
see
in
such
a
hole
i
wonder
the
indians
had
a
myth
of
chicamoztoc
which
means
the
seven
caves
that
we
came
out
of
this
is
the
pit
from
which
we
starks
were
digged
you
must
be
learned
that
what
you
see
in
it
and
what
do
you
see
yes
what
do
i
see
first
let
me
look
i
see
raspberry
vines
oh
if
you
going
to
use
your
eyes
just
hear
what
i
see
it
a
little
little
boy
as
pale
and
dim
as
a
match
flame
in
the
sun
he
groping
in
the
cellar
after
jam
he
thinks
it
dark
and
it
flooded
with
daylight
he
nothing
listen
when
i
lean
like
this
i
can
make
out
old
grandsir
stark
distinctly
with
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
his
brown
jug
bless
you
it
is
grandsir
stark
it
granny
but
the
pipe
there
and
smoking
and
the
jug
she
after
cider
the
old
girl
she
thirsty
here
hoping
she
gets
her
drink
and
gets
out
safely
tell
me
about
her
does
she
look
like
me
she
should
should
she
you
so
many
times
over
descended
from
her
i
believe
she
does
look
like
you
stay
the
way
you
are
the
nose
is
just
the
same
and
so
the
chin
making
allowance
making
due
allowance
you
poor
dear
great
great
great
great
granny
see
that
you
get
her
greatness
right
do
stint
her
yes
it
important
though
you
think
it
is
i
wo
be
teased
but
see
how
wet
i
am
yes
you
must
go
we
ca
stay
here
for
ever
but
wait
until
i
give
you
a
hand
up
a
bead
of
silver
water
more
or
less
strung
on
your
hair
wo
hurt
your
summer
looks
i
wanted
to
try
something
with
the
noise
that
the
brook
raises
in
the
empty
valley
we
have
seen
visions
now
consult
the
voices
something
i
must
have
learned
riding
in
trains
when
i
was
young
i
used
the
roar
to
set
the
voices
speaking
out
of
it
speaking
or
singing
and
the
playing
perhaps
you
have
the
art
of
what
i
mean
i
never
listened
in
among
the
sounds
that
a
brook
makes
in
such
a
wild
descent
it
ought
to
give
a
purer
oracle
it
as
you
throw
a
picture
on
a
screen
the
meaning
of
it
all
is
out
of
you
the
voices
give
you
what
you
wish
to
hear
strangely
it
anything
they
wish
to
give
then
i
do
know
it
must
be
strange
enough
i
wonder
if
it
not
your
what
do
you
think
you
like
to
hear
from
the
sense
of
our
having
been
together
but
why
take
time
for
what
i
like
to
hear
i
tell
you
what
the
voices
really
say
you
will
do
very
well
right
where
you
are
a
little
longer
i
must
feel
too
hurried
or
i
ca
give
myself
to
hear
the
voices
is
this
some
trance
you
are
withdrawing
into
you
must
be
very
still
you
must
talk
i
hardly
breathe
the
voices
seem
to
say
i
waiting
do
the
voices
seem
to
say
call
her
nausicaa
the
unafraid
of
an
acquaintance
made
adventurously
i
let
you
say
that
on
consideration
i
do
see
very
well
how
you
can
help
it
you
want
the
truth
i
speak
but
by
the
voices
you
see
they
know
i
have
had
your
name
though
what
a
name
should
matter
between
us
i
shall
suspect
be
good
the
voices
say
call
her
nausicaa
and
take
a
timber
that
you
shall
find
lies
in
the
cellar
charred
among
the
raspberries
and
hew
and
shape
it
for
a
or
other
corner
piece
in
a
new
cottage
on
the
ancient
spot
the
life
is
not
yet
all
gone
out
of
it
and
come
and
make
your
summer
dwelling
here
and
perhaps
she
will
come
still
unafraid
and
sit
before
you
in
the
open
door
with
flowers
in
her
lap
until
they
fade
but
not
come
in
across
the
sacred
sill
i
wonder
where
your
oracle
is
tending
you
can
see
that
there
something
wrong
with
it
or
it
would
speak
in
dialect
whose
voice
does
it
purport
to
speak
in
not
old
nor
granny
surely
call
up
one
of
them
they
have
best
right
to
be
heard
in
this
place
you
seem
so
partial
to
our
nine
times
removed
correct
me
if
i
err
you
will
be
likely
to
regard
as
sacred
anything
she
may
say
but
let
me
warn
you
folks
in
her
day
were
given
to
plain
speaking
you
think
you
best
tempt
her
at
such
a
time
it
rests
with
us
always
to
cut
her
off
well
then
it
granny
speaking
dunnow
mebbe
i
wrong
to
take
it
as
i
do
there
ai
no
names
quite
like
the
old
ones
though
nor
never
will
be
to
my
way
of
thinking
one
must
bear
too
hard
on
the
new
comers
but
there
a
dite
too
many
of
them
for
comfort
i
should
feel
easier
if
i
could
see
more
of
the
salt
wherewith
they
to
be
salted
son
you
do
as
you
told
you
take
the
timber
it
as
sound
as
the
day
when
it
was
cut
and
begin
over
there
she
better
stop
you
can
see
what
is
troubling
granny
though
but
do
you
think
we
sometimes
make
too
much
of
the
old
stock
what
counts
is
the
ideals
and
those
will
bear
some
keeping
still
about
i
can
see
we
are
going
to
be
good
friends
i
like
your
to
be
you
said
just
now
it
going
to
rain
i
know
and
it
was
raining
i
let
you
say
all
that
but
i
must
go
now
you
let
me
say
it
on
consideration
how
shall
we
say
in
such
a
case
how
shall
we
will
you
leave
the
way
to
me
no
i
do
trust
your
eyes
you
said
enough
now
give
me
your
hand
pick
me
that
flower
where
shall
we
meet
again
nowhere
but
here
once
more
before
we
meet
elsewhere
in
rain
it
ought
to
be
in
rain
sometime
in
rain
in
rain
shall
we
if
it
rains
but
if
we
must
in
sunshine
so
she
went
the
housekeeper
i
let
myself
in
at
the
kitchen
door
it
you
she
said
i
ca
get
up
forgive
me
not
answering
your
knock
i
can
no
more
let
people
in
than
i
can
keep
them
out
i
getting
too
old
for
my
size
i
tell
them
my
fingers
are
about
all
i
the
use
of
so
to
take
any
comfort
i
can
sew
i
help
out
with
this
beadwork
what
i
can
that
a
smart
pair
of
pumps
you
beading
there
who
are
they
for
you
mean
oh
for
some
miss
i
ca
keep
track
of
other
people
daughters
lord
if
i
were
to
dream
of
everyone
whose
shoes
i
primped
to
dance
in
and
where
john
have
you
seen
him
strange
what
set
you
off
to
come
to
his
house
when
he
gone
to
yours
you
ca
have
passed
each
other
i
know
what
he
must
have
changed
his
mind
and
gone
to
garlands
he
wo
be
long
in
that
case
you
can
wait
though
what
good
you
can
be
or
anyone
it
gone
so
far
you
heard
estelle
run
off
yes
what
it
all
about
when
did
she
go
two
weeks
since
she
in
earnest
it
appears
i
sure
she
wo
come
back
she
hiding
somewhere
i
do
know
where
myself
john
thinks
i
do
he
thinks
i
only
have
to
say
the
word
and
she
come
back
but
bless
you
i
her
mother
i
ca
talk
to
her
and
lord
if
i
could
it
will
go
hard
with
john
what
will
he
do
he
ca
find
anyone
to
take
her
place
oh
if
you
ask
me
that
what
will
he
do
he
gets
some
sort
of
bakeshop
meals
together
with
me
to
sit
and
tell
him
everything
what
wanted
and
how
much
and
where
it
is
but
when
i
gone
of
course
i
ca
stay
here
estelle
to
take
me
when
she
settled
down
he
and
i
only
hinder
one
another
i
tell
them
they
ca
get
me
through
the
door
though
i
been
built
in
here
like
a
big
church
organ
we
been
here
fifteen
years
that
a
long
time
to
live
together
and
then
pull
apart
how
do
you
see
him
living
when
you
gone
two
of
you
out
will
leave
an
empty
house
i
do
just
see
him
living
many
years
left
here
with
nothing
but
the
furniture
i
hate
to
think
of
the
old
place
when
we
gone
with
the
brook
going
by
below
the
yard
and
no
one
here
but
hens
blowing
about
if
he
could
sell
the
place
but
then
he
ca
no
one
will
ever
live
on
it
again
it
too
run
down
this
is
the
last
of
it
what
i
think
he
will
do
is
let
things
smash
he
sort
of
swear
the
time
away
he
awful
i
never
saw
a
man
let
family
troubles
make
so
much
difference
in
his
man
affairs
he
just
dropped
everything
he
like
a
child
i
blame
his
being
brought
up
by
his
mother
he
got
hay
down
that
been
rained
on
three
times
he
hoed
a
little
yesterday
for
me
i
thought
the
growing
things
would
do
him
good
something
went
wrong
i
saw
him
throw
the
hoe
with
both
hands
i
can
see
it
now
come
here
i
show
you
in
that
apple
tree
that
no
way
for
a
man
to
do
at
his
age
he
you
know
if
he
a
day
are
you
afraid
of
him
what
that
gun
for
oh
that
been
there
for
hawks
since
john
hall
touch
me
not
if
he
knows
his
friends
i
say
that
for
him
john
no
threatener
like
some
men
folk
no
one
afraid
of
him
all
is
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
stand
what
he
has
got
to
stand
where
is
estelle
could
one
talk
to
her
what
does
she
say
you
say
you
do
know
where
she
is
nor
want
to
she
thinks
if
it
was
bad
to
live
with
him
it
must
be
right
to
leave
him
which
is
wrong
yes
but
he
should
have
married
her
i
know
the
strain
been
too
much
for
her
all
these
years
i
ca
explain
it
any
other
way
it
different
with
a
man
at
least
with
john
he
knows
he
kinder
than
the
run
of
men
better
than
married
ought
to
be
as
good
as
married
that
what
he
has
always
said
i
know
the
way
he
felt
but
all
the
same
i
wonder
why
he
does
marry
her
and
end
it
too
late
now
she
would
have
him
he
given
her
time
to
think
of
something
else
that
his
mistake
the
dear
knows
my
interest
has
been
to
keep
the
thing
from
breaking
up
this
is
a
good
home
i
do
ask
for
better
but
when
i
said
should
they
be
married
he
say
should
they
no
more
words
than
that
and
after
all
why
should
they
john
been
fair
i
take
it
what
was
his
was
always
hers
there
was
no
quarrel
about
property
reason
enough
there
was
no
property
a
friend
or
two
as
good
as
own
the
farm
such
as
it
is
it
is
worth
the
mortgage
i
mean
estelle
has
always
held
the
purse
the
rights
of
that
are
harder
to
get
at
i
guess
estelle
and
i
have
filled
the
purse
was
we
let
him
have
money
not
he
us
john
a
bad
farmer
i
not
blaming
him
take
it
year
in
year
out
he
does
make
much
we
came
here
for
a
home
for
me
you
know
estelle
to
do
the
housework
for
the
board
of
both
of
us
but
look
how
it
turns
out
she
seems
to
have
the
housework
and
besides
half
of
the
outdoor
work
though
as
for
that
he
say
she
does
it
more
because
she
likes
it
you
see
our
pretty
things
are
all
outdoors
our
hens
and
cows
and
pigs
are
always
better
than
folks
like
us
have
any
business
with
farmers
around
twice
as
well
off
as
we
have
as
good
they
do
go
with
the
farm
one
thing
you
ca
help
liking
about
john
he
fond
of
nice
things
too
fond
some
would
say
but
estelle
do
complain
she
like
him
there
she
wants
our
hens
to
be
the
best
there
are
you
never
saw
this
room
before
a
show
full
of
lank
shivery
birds
in
separate
coops
having
their
plumage
done
the
smell
of
the
wet
feathers
in
the
heat
you
spoke
of
john
not
being
safe
to
stay
with
you
do
know
what
a
gentle
lot
we
are
we
would
hurt
a
hen
you
ought
to
see
us
moving
a
flock
of
hens
from
place
to
place
we
not
allowed
to
take
them
upside
down
all
we
can
hold
together
by
the
legs
two
at
a
time
the
rule
one
on
each
arm
no
matter
how
far
and
how
many
times
we
have
to
go
you
mean
that
john
idea
and
we
live
up
to
it
or
i
do
know
what
childishness
he
would
give
way
to
he
manages
to
keep
the
upper
hand
on
his
own
farm
he
boss
but
as
to
hens
we
fence
our
flowers
in
and
the
hens
range
nothing
too
good
for
them
we
say
it
pays
john
likes
to
tell
the
offers
he
has
had
twenty
for
this
cock
for
that
he
never
takes
the
money
if
they
worth
that
much
to
sell
they
worth
as
much
to
keep
bless
you
it
all
expense
though
reach
me
down
the
little
tin
box
on
the
cupboard
shelf
the
upper
shelf
the
tin
box
that
the
one
i
show
you
here
you
are
what
this
a
bill
for
fifty
dollars
for
one
langshang
cock
receipted
and
the
cock
is
in
the
yard
not
in
a
glass
case
then
he
need
a
tall
one
he
can
eat
off
a
barrel
from
the
ground
he
been
in
a
glass
case
as
you
may
say
the
crystal
palace
london
he
imported
john
bought
him
and
we
paid
the
bill
with
beads
wampum
i
call
it
mind
we
do
complain
but
you
see
do
you
we
take
care
of
him
and
like
it
too
it
makes
it
all
the
worse
it
seems
as
if
and
that
not
all
he
helpless
in
ways
that
i
can
hardly
tell
you
of
sometimes
he
gets
possessed
to
keep
accounts
to
see
where
all
the
money
goes
so
fast
you
know
how
men
will
be
ridiculous
but
it
just
fun
the
way
he
gets
bedeviled
if
he
untidy
now
what
will
he
be
it
makes
it
all
the
worse
you
must
be
blind
estelle
the
one
you
need
talk
to
me
ca
you
and
i
get
to
the
root
of
it
what
the
real
trouble
what
will
satisfy
her
it
as
i
say
she
turned
from
him
that
all
but
why
when
she
well
off
is
it
the
neighbours
being
cut
off
from
friends
we
have
our
friends
that
is
it
folks
are
afraid
of
us
she
let
it
worry
her
you
stood
the
strain
and
you
her
mother
but
i
did
always
i
did
relish
it
along
at
first
but
i
got
wonted
to
it
and
besides
john
said
i
was
too
old
to
have
grandchildren
but
what
the
use
of
talking
when
it
done
she
wo
come
back
it
worse
than
that
she
ca
why
do
you
speak
like
that
what
do
you
know
what
do
you
mean
she
done
harm
to
herself
i
mean
she
married
married
someone
else
oho
oho
you
do
believe
me
yes
i
do
only
too
well
i
knew
there
must
be
something
so
that
was
what
was
back
she
bad
that
all
bad
to
get
married
when
she
had
the
chance
nonsense
see
what
she
done
but
who
who
who
marry
her
straight
out
of
such
a
mess
say
it
right
out
no
matter
for
her
mother
the
man
was
found
i
better
name
no
names
john
himself
wo
imagine
who
he
is
then
it
all
up
i
think
i
get
away
you
be
expecting
john
i
pity
estelle
i
suppose
she
deserves
some
pity
too
you

the
man

said

to
hear

i
talk
to
you
old
woman
afterward

news
what
are
they
trying
to
do
to
me
these
two
do
go
along
with
him
and
stop
his
shouting
she
raised
her
voice
against
the
closing
door
who
wants
to
hear
your
news
you
dreadful
fool
the
fear
a
lantern
light
from
deeper
in
the
barn
shone
on
a
man
and
woman
in
the
door
and
threw
their
lurching
shadows
on
a
house
near
by
all
dark
in
every
glossy
window
a
horse
hoof
pawed
once
the
hollow
floor
and
the
back
of
the
gig
they
stood
beside
moved
in
a
little
the
man
grasped
a
wheel
the
woman
spoke
out
sharply
whoa
stand
still
i
saw
it
just
as
plain
as
a
white
plate
she
said
as
the
light
on
the
dashboard
ran
along
the
bushes
at
the
roadside
a
man
face
you
must
have
seen
it
too
i
did
see
it
are
you
sure
yes
i
sure
it
was
a
face
joel
i
have
to
look
i
ca
go
in
i
ca
and
leave
a
thing
like
that
unsettled
doors
locked
and
curtains
drawn
will
make
no
difference
i
always
have
felt
strange
when
we
came
home
to
the
dark
house
after
so
long
an
absence
and
the
key
rattled
loudly
into
place
seemed
to
warn
someone
to
be
getting
out
at
one
door
as
we
entered
at
another
what
if
i
right
and
someone
all
the
time
do
hold
my
arm
i
say
it
someone
passing
you
speak
as
if
this
were
a
travelled
road
you
forget
where
we
are
what
is
beyond
that
he
be
going
to
or
coming
from
at
such
an
hour
of
night
and
on
foot
too
what
was
he
standing
still
for
in
the
bushes
it
not
so
very
late
it
only
dark
there
more
in
it
than
you
inclined
to
say
did
he
look
like
he
looked
like
anyone
i
never
rest
unless
i
know
give
me
the
lantern
you
do
want
the
lantern
she
pushed
past
him
and
got
it
for
herself
you
not
to
come
she
said
this
is
my
business
if
the
time
come
to
face
it
i
the
one
to
put
it
the
right
way
he
never
dare
listen
he
kicked
a
stone
hear
that
hear
that
he
coming
towards
us
joel
go
in
please
hark
i
do
hear
him
now
but
please
go
in
in
the
first
place
you
ca
make
me
believe
it
it
is
or
someone
else
he
sent
to
watch
and
now
the
time
to
have
it
out
with
him
while
we
know
definitely
where
he
is
let
him
get
off
and
he
be
everywhere
around
us
looking
out
of
trees
and
bushes
till
i
dare
to
set
a
foot
outdoors
and
i
ca
stand
it
joel
let
me
go
but
it
nonsense
to
think
he
care
enough
you
mean
you
could
understand
his
caring
oh
but
you
see
he
had
had
enough
joel
i
wo
i
wo
i
promise
you
we
must
say
hard
things
you
must
either
i
be
the
one
if
anybody
goes
but
you
give
him
the
advantage
with
this
light
what
could
he
do
to
us
standing
here
and
if
to
see
was
what
he
wanted
why
he
has
seen
all
there
was
to
see
and
gone
he
appeared
to
forget
to
keep
his
hold
but
advanced
with
her
as
she
crossed
the
grass
what
do
you
want
she
cried
to
all
the
dark
she
stretched
up
tall
to
overlook
the
light
that
hung
in
both
hands
hot
against
her
skirt
there
no
one
so
you
wrong
he
said
there
what
do
you
want
she
cried
and
then
herself
was
startled
when
an
answer
really
came
nothing
it
came
from
well
along
the
road
she
reached
a
hand
to
joel
for
support
the
smell
of
scorching
woollen
made
her
faint
what
are
you
doing
round
this
house
at
night
nothing
a
pause
there
seemed
no
more
to
say
and
then
the
voice
again
you
seem
afraid
i
saw
by
the
way
you
whipped
up
the
horse
i
just
come
forward
in
the
lantern
light
and
let
you
see
yes
joel
go
back
she
stood
her
ground
against
the
noisy
steps
that
came
on
but
her
body
rocked
a
little
you
see
the
voice
said
oh
she
looked
and
looked
you
do
see
i
a
child
here
by
the
hand
what
a
child
doing
at
this
time
of
night
out
walking
every
child
should
have
the
memory
of
at
least
one
walk
what
son
then
i
should
think
you
try
to
find
somewhere
to
walk
the
highway
as
it
happens
we
stopping
for
the
fortnight
down
at
dean
but
if
that
all
joel
you
realize
you
wo
think
anything
you
understand
you
understand
that
we
have
to
be
careful
this
is
a
very
very
lonely
place
joel
she
spoke
as
if
she
could
turn
the
swinging
lantern
lengthened
to
the
ground
it
touched
it
struck
it
clattered
and
went
out
the
willis
i
did
want
you
here
the
lawyer
coming
for
the
company
i
going
to
sell
my
soul
or
rather
feet
five
hundred
dollars
for
the
pair
you
know
with
you
the
feet
have
nearly
been
the
soul
and
if
you
going
to
sell
them
to
the
devil
i
want
to
see
you
do
it
when
he
coming
i
half
suspect
you
knew
and
came
on
purpose
to
try
to
help
me
drive
a
better
bargain
well
if
it
true
yours
are
no
common
feet
the
lawyer
do
know
what
it
is
he
buying
so
many
miles
you
might
have
walked
you
wo
walk
you
have
run
your
forty
orchids
down
what
does
he
think
how
are
the
blessed
feet
the
doctor
sure
you
going
to
walk
again
he
thinks
i
hobble
it
both
legs
and
feet
they
must
be
terrible
i
mean
to
look
at
i
have
dared
to
look
at
them
uncovered
through
the
bed
blankets
i
remind
myself
of
a
starfish
laid
out
with
rigid
points
the
wonder
is
it
had
been
your
head
it
hard
to
tell
you
how
i
managed
it
when
i
saw
the
shaft
had
me
by
the
coat
i
did
try
too
long
to
pull
away
or
fumble
for
my
knife
to
cut
away
i
just
embraced
the
shaft
and
rode
it
out
till
weiss
shut
off
the
water
in
the
that
how
i
think
i
did
lose
my
head
but
my
legs
got
their
knocks
against
the
ceiling
awful
why
did
they
throw
off
the
belt
instead
of
going
clear
down
in
the
they
say
some
time
was
wasted
on
the
belt
old
streak
of
leather
does
love
me
much
because
i
make
him
spit
fire
at
my
knuckles
the
way
ben
franklin
used
to
make
the
that
must
be
it
some
days
he
wo
stay
on
that
day
a
woman
could
coax
him
off
he
on
his
rounds
now
with
his
tail
in
his
mouth
snatched
right
and
left
across
the
silver
pulleys
everything
goes
the
same
without
me
there
you
can
hear
the
small
buzz
saws
whine
the
big
saw
caterwaul
to
the
hills
around
the
village
as
they
both
bite
the
wood
it
all
our
music
one
ought
as
a
good
villager
to
like
it
no
doubt
it
has
a
sort
of
prosperous
sound
and
it
our
life
yes
when
it
not
our
death
you
make
that
sound
as
if
it
was
so
with
everything
what
we
live
by
we
die
by
i
wonder
where
my
lawyer
is
his
train
in
i
want
this
over
with
i
hot
and
tired
you
getting
ready
to
do
something
foolish
watch
for
him
will
you
will
you
let
him
in
i
rather
corbin
did
know
i
boarded
here
so
long
she
thinks
she
owns
me
you
bad
enough
to
manage
without
her
and
i
going
to
be
worse
instead
of
better
you
got
to
tell
me
how
far
this
is
gone
have
you
agreed
to
any
price
five
hundred
five
hundred
five
five
one
two
three
four
five
you
need
look
at
me
i
do
believe
you
i
told
you
willis
when
you
first
came
in
do
you
be
hard
on
me
i
have
to
take
what
i
can
get
you
see
they
have
the
feet
which
gives
them
the
advantage
in
the
trade
i
ca
get
back
the
feet
in
any
case
but
your
flowers
man
you
selling
out
your
flowers
yes
that
one
way
to
put
it
all
the
flowers
of
every
kind
everywhere
in
this
region
for
the
next
forty
summers
call
it
forty
but
i
not
selling
those
i
giving
them
they
never
earned
me
so
much
as
one
cent
money
ca
pay
me
for
the
loss
of
them
no
the
five
hundred
was
the
sum
they
named
to
pay
the
doctor
bill
and
tide
me
over
it
that
or
fight
and
i
do
want
to
fight
i
just
want
to
get
settled
in
my
life
such
as
it
going
to
be
and
know
the
worst
or
best
it
may
not
be
so
bad
the
firm
promise
me
all
the
shooks
i
want
to
nail
but
what
about
your
flora
of
the
valley
you
have
me
there
but
that
you
did
think
that
was
worth
money
to
me
still
i
own
it
goes
against
me
not
to
finish
it
for
the
friends
it
might
bring
me
by
the
way
i
had
a
letter
from
burroughs
did
i
tell
you
about
my
cyprepedium
reginæ
he
says
it
not
reported
so
far
north
there
there
the
bell
he
rung
but
you
go
down
and
bring
him
up
and
do
let
mrs
oh
well
we
soon
be
through
with
it
i
tired
willis
brought
up
besides
the
boston
lawyer
a
little
barefoot
girl
who
in
the
noise
of
heavy
footsteps
in
the
old
frame
house
and
baritone
importance
of
the
lawyer
stood
for
a
while
unnoticed
with
her
hands
shyly
behind
her
well
and
how
is
mister
the
lawyer
was
already
in
his
satchel
as
if
for
papers
that
might
bear
the
name
he
had
at
command
you
must
excuse
me
i
dropped
in
at
the
mill
and
was
detained
looking
round
i
suppose
said
willis
yes
well
yes
hear
anything
that
might
prove
useful
the
broken
one
saw
anne
why
here
is
anne
what
do
you
want
dear
come
stand
by
the
bed
tell
me
what
is
it
anne
just
wagged
her
dress
with
both
hands
held
behind
her
guess
she
said
oh
guess
which
hand
my
my
once
on
a
time
i
knew
a
lovely
way
to
tell
for
certain
by
looking
in
the
ears
but
i
forget
it
er
let
me
see
i
think
i
take
the
right
that
sure
to
be
right
even
if
it
wrong
come
hold
it
out
do
a
ram
horn
orchid
a
ram
horn
what
would
i
have
got
i
wonder
if
i
had
chosen
left
hold
out
the
left
another
ram
horn
where
did
you
find
those
under
what
beech
tree
on
what
woodchuck
knoll
anne
looked
at
the
large
lawyer
at
her
side
and
thought
she
would
venture
on
so
much
were
there
no
others
there
were
four
or
five
i
knew
you
would
let
me
pick
them
all
i
would
so
i
would
you
the
girl
you
see
anne
has
her
lesson
learned
by
heart
i
wanted
there
should
be
some
there
next
year
of
course
you
did
you
left
the
rest
for
seed
and
for
the
backwoods
woodchuck
you
the
girl
a
ram
horn
orchid
seedpod
for
a
woodchuck
sounds
something
like
better
than
farmer
beans
to
a
discriminating
appetite
though
the
ram
horn
is
seldom
to
be
had
in
bushel
lots
does
come
on
the
market
but
anne
i
troubled
have
you
told
me
all
you
hiding
something
that
as
bad
as
lying
you
ask
this
lawyer
man
and
it
not
safe
with
a
lawyer
at
hand
to
find
you
out
nothing
is
hidden
from
some
people
anne
you
do
tell
me
that
where
you
found
a
ram
horn
you
did
find
a
yellow
lady
slipper
what
did
i
tell
you
what
i
blush
i
would
do
you
defend
yourself
if
it
was
there
where
is
it
now
the
yellow
lady
slipper
well
wait
it
common
it
too
common
common
the
purple
lady
slipper
commoner
i
did
bring
a
purple
lady
slipper
to
you
to
you
i
mean
they
both
too
common
the
lawyer
gave
a
laugh
among
his
papers
as
if
with
some
idea
that
she
had
scored
i
broken
anne
of
gathering
bouquets
it
not
fair
to
the
child
it
ca
be
helped
though
pressed
into
service
means
pressed
out
of
shape
somehow
i
make
it
right
with
her
she
see
she
going
to
do
my
scouting
in
the
field
over
stone
walls
and
all
along
a
wood
and
by
a
river
bank
for
water
flowers
the
floating
heart
with
small
leaf
like
a
heart
and
at
the
sinus
under
water
a
fist
of
little
fingers
all
kept
down
but
one
and
that
thrust
up
to
blossom
in
the
sun
as
if
to
say
you
the
heart
desire
anne
has
a
way
with
flowers
to
take
the
place
of
that
she
lost
she
goes
down
on
one
knee
and
lifts
their
faces
by
the
chin
to
hers
and
says
their
names
and
leaves
them
where
they
are
the
lawyer
wore
a
watch
the
case
of
which
was
cunningly
devised
to
make
a
noise
like
a
small
pistol
when
he
snapped
it
shut
at
such
a
time
as
this
he
snapped
it
now
well
anne
go
dearie
our
affair
will
wait
the
lawyer
man
is
thinking
of
his
train
he
wants
to
give
me
lots
and
lots
of
money
before
he
goes
because
i
hurt
myself
and
it
may
take
him
i
do
know
how
long
but
put
our
flowers
in
water
first
will
help
her
the
pitcher
too
full
for
her
there
no
cup
just
hook
them
on
the
inside
of
the
pitcher
now
get
out
your
documents
you
see
i
have
to
keep
on
the
good
side
of
anne
i
a
great
boy
to
think
of
number
one
and
you
ca
blame
me
in
the
place
i
in
who
will
take
care
of
my
necessities
unless
i
do
a
pretty
interlude
the
lawyer
said
i
sorry
but
my
train
luckily
terms
are
all
agreed
upon
you
only
have
to
sign
your
name
right
there
you
will
stop
making
faces
come
round
here
where
you
ca
make
them
what
is
it
you
want
i
put
you
out
with
anne
be
good
or
go
you
do
mean
you
will
sign
that
thing
unread
make
yourself
useful
then
and
read
it
for
me
is
it
something
i
have
seen
before
you
find
it
is
let
your
friend
look
at
it
yes
but
all
that
takes
time
and
i
as
much
in
haste
to
get
it
over
with
as
you
but
read
it
read
it
that
right
draw
the
curtain
half
the
time
i
do
know
what
troubling
what
do
you
say
will
do
you
be
a
fool
you
crumpling
folkses
legal
documents
out
with
it
if
you
any
real
objection
five
hundred
dollars
what
would
you
think
right
a
thousand
would
be
a
cent
too
much
you
know
it
lawyer
the
sin
is
accepting
anything
before
he
knows
whether
he
ever
going
to
walk
again
it
smells
to
me
like
a
dishonest
trick
i

what

pair
of
cocks

your
train
he
flung
his
arms
around
his
face
the
out
walking
in
the
frozen
swamp
one
grey
day
i
paused
and
said
i
will
turn
back
from
here
no
i
will
go
on
farther
and
we
shall
see
the
hard
snow
held
me
save
where
now
and
then
one
foot
went
down
the
view
was
all
in
lines
straight
up
and
down
of
tall
slim
trees
too
much
alike
to
mark
or
name
a
place
by
so
as
to
say
for
certain
i
was
here
or
somewhere
else
i
was
just
far
from
home
a
small
bird
flew
before
me
he
was
careful
to
put
a
tree
between
us
when
he
lighted
and
say
no
word
to
tell
me
who
he
was
who
was
so
foolish
as
to
think
what
he
thought
he
thought
that
i
was
after
him
for
a
feather
the
white
one
in
his
tail
like
one
who
takes
everything
said
as
personal
to
himself
one
flight
out
sideways
would
have
undeceived
him
and
then
there
was
a
pile
of
wood
for
which
i
forgot
him
and
let
his
little
fear
carry
him
off
the
way
i
might
have
gone
without
so
much
as
wishing
him
he
went
behind
it
to
make
his
last
stand
it
was
a
cord
of
maple
cut
and
split
and
piled
and
measured
four
by
four
by
eight
and
not
another
like
it
could
i
see
no
runner
tracks
in
this
year
snow
looped
near
it
and
it
was
older
sure
than
this
year
cutting
or
even
last
year
or
the
year
before
the
wood
was
grey
and
the
bark
warping
off
it
and
the
pile
somewhat
sunken
clematis
had
wound
strings
round
and
round
it
like
a
bundle
what
held
it
though
on
one
side
was
a
tree
still
growing
and
on
one
a
stake
and
prop
these
latter
about
to
fall
i
thought
that
only
someone
who
lived
in
turning
to
fresh
tasks
could
so
forget
his
handiwork
on
which
he
spent
himself
the
labour
of
his
axe
and
leave
it
there
far
from
a
useful
fireplace
to
warm
the
frozen
swamp
as
best
it
could
with
the
slow
smokeless
burning
of
decay
good
hours
i
had
for
my
winter
evening
walk
no
one
at
all
with
whom
to
talk
but
i
had
the
cottages
in
a
row
up
to
their
shining
eyes
in
snow
and
i
thought
i
had
the
folk
within
i
had
the
sound
of
a
violin
i
had
a
glimpse
through
curtain
laces
of
youthful
forms
and
youthful
faces
i
had
such
company
outward
bound
i
went
till
there
were
no
cottages
found
i
turned
and
repented
but
coming
back
i
saw
no
window
but
that
was
black
over
the
snow
my
creaking
feet
disturbed
the
slumbering
village
street
like
profanation
by
your
leave
at
ten
of
a
winter
eve
