burned
within
his
heart
he
took
to
wife

seed

stirs

veins

life
that

begun

seed
that
breaks

wind
that
blows
each
in

seeks
and
finds
repose
wherefore
o
king
since
thou
art
yet
unwed
and
thus
in
kingship
standest
incomplete
unfurnished
in
thy
heart
from
whence
are
fed
the
streams
of
power
and
wisdom
it
is
not
meet
that
unto
thee
thy
people
bow
the

and
here
thy
sovereignty
with
tribute
own

thou

ceased
and
all
the
faces
of
the
crowd
shone
with
the
light
that
kindles
when
the
boon
of
speech
has
eased
the
heart
as
when
a
cloud
falls
from
the
labouring
shoulder
of
the
moon
and
all
the
world
stands
smiling
king
eochaidh
for
a
moment
bent
his
head
in
thought
then
smiling
he
arose
and
said
i
am
not
careless
of
the
ancient
need
that
moves
your
minds
within
my
own
it
moves
like
a
unforgotten
seed
the
spring
has
touched
uneasily
like
hooves
long
captive
when
the
trumpet
has
decreed
a
royal
pilgrimage
and
in
the
liss
they
dance
to
taste
the
highway
ringing
bliss
so
have
i
watched
for
that
sure
sign
that
fills
the
horn
of
fate
that
bending
this
our
realm
unto
the
will
that
works
behind
our
wills
it
may
remain
as
when
storms
overwhelm
and
leafy
spray
whirls
over
the
roaring
hills
the
swaying
pine
bends
as
the
storm
wars
by
and
lives
to
shake
proud
arms
against
the
sky
but
now
the
horn
is
full
the
hour
is
here
our
wills
as
one
move
onward
to
their
end
here
now
i
lift
on
high
the
royal
spear
and
thus
through
erin
proclamation
send
for
the
promised
maiden
far
and
near
whom
the
high
gods
have
destined
at
my
side
to
reign
go
forth
the
king
awaits
his
bride
she
shall
be
found
in
some
most
quiet
place
where
beauty
sits
all
day
beside
her
knee
and
looks
with
happy
envy
on
her
face
where
virtue
blushes
her
own
guilt
to
see
and
grace
learns
new
sweet
meanings
from
her
grace
where
all
that
ever
was
or
will
be
wise
pales
at
the
burning
wisdom
of
her
eyes
when
you
at
last
far
off
like
worshippers
within
some
holy
circle
bow
your
heads
you
shall
await
till
on
that
face
of
a
smile
like
spring
first
morning
slowly
spreads
and
when
her
lip
with
wondrous
music
stirs
bear
hither
like
the
wind
her
deathless
name
that
i
may
light
my
heart
at
its
white
flame
scarce
had
he
ceased
when
from
the
royal
tent
broke
the
full
tide
of
their
loud
ecstacy
and
through
the
woods
like
summer
thunder
went
full
of
great
rumour
of
mighty
things
to
be
that
died
far
off
like
twilight
breezes
spent
then
sang
the
bard
in
hidden
wisdom
skilled
thus
is
the
purpose
of
the
gods
fulfilled
now
the
hands
that
may
not
bless
a
wifeless
feast
a
queenless
throne
a
court
or
council
womanless
or
life
and
sideways
grown
that
holds
the
hands
that
may
not
starry
virgin
of
the
east
steps
up
the
sky
to
lead
the
sign
where
most
has
kissed
and
mixed
with
least
and
life
torches
shine
behind
the
virgin
of
the
lift
the
hands
that
gladly
bless
full
life
to
life
great
fulness
grown
a
power
to
stand
through
shock
and
stress
and
rear
an
everlasting
throne
held
high
on
hands
that
gladly
then
on
a
night
when
on
his
hearth
the
gleam
of
crackling
faggots
flung
a
wavering
glow
along
his
roof
from
beam
to
beam
like
glancing
eyes
king
eochaidh
to
and
fro
turned
on
his
couch
dreaming
a
happy
dream
of
snapping
stems
and
crisp
leaves
crushed
by
feet
with
high
desire
made
musical
and
fleet
out
of
the
fire
a
swift
and
slender
shaft
of
yellow
flame
pierced
through
the
king
dropped
lids
and
woke
a
murmur
of
bees
whose
eager
craft
rifled
the
treasures
of
blossomy
pyramids
whereat
the
king
raising
his
hand
low
laughed
then
passed
like
some
worn
swimmer
on
the
sweep
of
strong
waves
toward
the
unfathomed
gulf
of
sleep
at
length
in
that
white
hour
when
dewy
wings
stir
with
new
day
delight
there
came
a
sound
as
though
a
passion
of
voices
and
smitten
strings
mingled
and
swelled
and
flew
along
the
ground
till
at
the
utmost
of
its
triumphings
through
the
king
sleep
and
on
his
door
the
dawn
broke
and
a
mighty
shout
etain
etain
ii
thereafter
on
a
morning
rich
with
spring
when
round
his
feet
flowers
looked
up
and
wet
at
some
most
wondrous
thing
and
crystal
draughts
from
many
an
odorous
cup
were
spilled
by
winds
in
playful
rioting
king
eochaidh
stood
beside
a
quiet
shore
dumb
with
a
joy
he
never
knew
before
from
league
to
league
alone
his
path
had
lain
on
windy
hills
through
forests
dark
or
deep
in
dank
sonorous
glens
through
every
vein
a
burning
joy
had
drunk
the
mists
of
sleep
and
sung
etain
etain
till
the
refrain
irked
and
he
slept
and
when
he
sprang
awake
saw
that
which
made
his
heart
with
rapture
shake
there
by
the
sea
etain
his
destined
bride
sat
unabashed
unwitting
of
the
sight
of
him
who
gazed
upon
her
gleaming
side
fair
as
the
snowfall
of
a
single
night
her
arms
like
foam
upon
the
flowing
tide
her
limbs
in
all
their
beauty
bare
straight
as
the
rule
of
dagda
carpenter
her
cheeks
were
like
the
foxglove
when
it
glows
at
noon
her
eyes
blue
as
the
hyacinth
like
moonlight
struck
to
marble
nobly
rose
her
neck
upon
her
shoulder
polished
plinth
and
like
the
light
that
swiftly
comes
and
goes
through
breaking
waves
among
her
hair
her
hands
broke
into
wavy
gold
its
plaited
strands
then
came
her
maidens
bright
and
blossoming
with
beauty
and
before
her
beauty
bowed
and
stood
around
her
in
a
laughing
ring
to
robe
her
starry
splendour
like
a
cloud
and
as
her
hair
they
twined
the
hidden
king
scarce
knew
if
on
her
lips
that
knew
no
wrong
or
in
his
own
hushed
heart
he
heard
this
song
king
comes
riding
from
the
north
from
battles
won
with
marching
men
ah
whose
white
eager
arms
go
forth
to
bid
him
welcome
home
again
when
he
comes
riding
from
the
north
king
comes
riding
from
the
south
and
halts
beside
the
royal
liss
ah
whose
the
happy
smiling
mouth
that
gives
and
takes
a
long
warm
kiss
when
he
comes
riding
from
the
south
king
comes
riding
from
the
east
o
night
how
dark
o
way
how
long
ah
whose
dear
eyes
shall
light
the
feast
ah
who
shall
lift
his
heart
with
song
when
he
comes
riding
from
the
east
king
comes
riding
from
the
west
and
smiles
unto
himself
and
sighs
ah
whose
the
white
and
easeful
breast
where
he
shall
close
his
kingly
eyes
when
he
comes
riding
from
the
west
small
wonder
now
that
eochaidh
leaping
heart
strained
like
a
hound
in
leash
yet
through
his
bliss
there
passed
a
thin
cold
blade
with
sudden
smart
of
doubt
that
he
but
dreamed
of
dread
that
this
was
but
a
vision
that
would
soon
depart
but
when
the
song
had
ceased
there
stood
the
maid
flushed
with
keen
joy
and
like
a
queen
arrayed
a
mantle
of
bright
purple
waving
wound
her
form
and
from
her
shoulders
white
as
milk
fell
in
reluctant
folds
and
touched
the
ground
upon
her
breast
the
flash
of
emerald
silk
as
though
the
glory
of
earth
had
wrapped
her
round
mixed
with
the
glow
of
red
embroidered
gold
that
seemed
with
light
her
body
to
enfold
a
sudden
breeze
came
singing
from
the
sea
and
broke
with
sunlight
through
the
leafy
shade
then
came
king
eochaidh
forth
and
on
his
knee
bent
low
before
the
silent
trembling
maid
the
king
he
said
has
come
and
kneels
to
thee
foredoomed
to
share
the
burden
of
his
throne
and
glorify
its
glory
with
thine
own
then
through
her
frame
a
gentle
tremor
went
and
lit
her
face
with
exquisite
swift
fire
that
woke
forgotten
dreams
whose
shaken
scent
sweetened
the
quiet
winds
of
her
desire
with
some
divine
unuttered
ravishment
some
earnest
of
great
doom
that
filled
her
heart
with
sorrow
joy
majestic
counterpart
upon
his
head
she
gently
laid
her
hand
and
said
arise
to
thee
my
heart
has
bowed
when
minstrel
after
minstrel
tired
and
tanned
has
supped
beside
our
hearth
and
sung
the
proud
high
song
that
bears
thy
greatness
through
the
land
for
thee
from
life
clear
dawn
my
love
remained
fixed
and
at
length
to
thee
i
have
attained
iii
across
the
woods
of
meath
the
bird
of
day
fell
from
the
boughs
of
noon
with
bleeding
wing
while
balor
strode
the
eastern
way
and
scattered
darkness
from
his
cloudy
sling
till
at
his
feet
the
hosts
of
erin
lay
smitten
with
sleep
then
round
their
dreams
he
cast
the
chains
wherewith
he
binds
his
prisoners
fast
from
dawn
till
dark
in
many
a
glad
eyes
had
flashed
or
bent
in
pride
august
to
hear
the
chant
of
some
undying
name
whose
deeds
were
strong
as
wine
anon
the
dust
of
festive
feet
stormed
in
a
wild
acclaim
around
the
royal
place
where
side
by
side
sat
eochaidh
and
etain
his
bride
now
ancient
sleep
with
silence
for
his
queen
reigns
those
palaces
of
stately
fir
that
drowse
in
curtained
moonlight
misty
sheen
within
the
arras
hardly
seems
to
stir
its
languorous
folds
of
purple
blue
and
green
whose
colours
part
or
mix
as
rise
and
fall
the
pine
fire
odorous
gleams
on
roof
and
wall
no
sound
no
life
save
where
with
soft
salute
the
sentinels
a
moment
wait
and
listen
sidelong
to
the
passing
bruit
of
ghostly
winds
that
murmur
at
their
state
and
pass
with
peevish
cry
and
soundless
foot
where
the
dead
fly
upon
the
waveless
moat
makes
of
the
dead
dropped
leaf
a
funeral
boat
yet
in
the
midst
of
silence
so
profound
one
stirred
his
rushy
couch
as
though
in
pain
for
through
his
dreams
a
torrent
of
swift
sound
stumbled
in
foam
about
his
echoing
brain
and
all
his
thought
in
loud
confusion
drowned
and
bore
him
toward
a
dim
and
perilous
steep
that
flung
its
shadow
on
a
writhing
deep
then
like
the
sun
obscured
by
valley
smoke
with
some
vague
trouble
glooming
in
his
eye
ailill
the
brother
of
the
king
awoke
and
scanned
the
portents
of
the
morning
sky
till
on
his
mind
a
mellowing
radiance
broke
and
in
his
heart
there
dawned
a
wondrous
face
that
lit
his
world
with
love
exalted
grace
often
in
dreams
a
shadow
by
his
side
had
sung
of
one
who
came
in
some
great
hour
with
love
and
woe
now
came
his
brother
bride
and
when
he
bent
before
her
in
her
bower
within
his
heart
the
shadow
rose
and
cried
and
passed
away
while
all
his
being
shook
stricken
with
joy
and
sorrow
in
a
look
among
the
clamours
of
the
festal
time
his
love
for
ease
he
hid
again
pursued
finding
a
solace
in
the
chanted
rhyme
of
ag√©d
bards
or
youths
in
merry
mood
where
angry
words
were
counted
as
a
crime
and
fireside
friendship
staunched
his
hungry
sighs
when
she
no
more
was
banquet
for
his
eyes
but
when
the
marriage
festival
was
past
and
restless
day
gave
place
to
torturing
night
his
captive
passion
burst
its
chains
and
cast
its
ardours
from
his
brain
in
living
light
then
like
the
thin
voice
of
a
blast
a
dissonant
note
from
hidden
drawn
troubled
the
dreams
of
eochaidh
and
etain
by
day
the
dream
had
faded
to
a
mist
in
some
valley
of
the
mind
but
when
in
evening
amethyst
the
labouring
world
grew
wonderfully
kind
and
upturned
lips
by
brooding
love
were
kissed
like
silent
rain
in
summer
twilight
spilled
a
wandering
thought
king
eochaidh
touched
and
chilled
meanwhile
with
steps
that
would
and
would
not
shun
bliss
craved
and
spurned
with
tongue
that
might
not
speak
the
pain
that
some
strange
sweetness
now
had
won
ailill
moved
to
and
fro
and
soon
his
cheek
paled
like
the
austere
servants
of
the
sun
and
day
by
day
his
passion
famished
flame
nourished
itself
upon
his
wasting
frame
in
vain
the
king
diviners
daily
strove
to
find
the
spring
of
ailill
gathering
ill
in
vain
etain
by
stream
and
murmuring
grove
sought
for
the
shadowy
hand
that
held
his
will
and
when
dark
balor
cracked
his
whip
and
drove
his
winter
herd
across
the
bounds
of
day
ailill
upon
his
couch
in
weakness
lay
so
when
a
year
had
passed
and
through
the
land
the
king
went
forth
on
royal
pilgrimage
unto
etain
he
gave
his
last
command
that
she
his
brother
sickness
to
assuage
withhold
no
gift
but
give
with
regal
hand
and
should
chill
death
blow
out
his
flickering
blaze
his
with
honour
she
should
raise
iv
from
day
to
day
etain
with
eager
thought
outran
sick
ailill
needs
from
sun
and
wind
a
subtle
medicine
caught
and
charmed
swift
healing
from
the
reeds
upon
his
floor
which
her
own
hands
had
brought
from
ferny
hollows
where
cool
waters
laughed
that
ailill
from
her
cup
with
gladness
quaffed
yet
with
each
dawn
that
came
with
growing
power
there
grew
a
cloudy
thought
in
ailill
mind
that
gloomed
the
joy
of
health
returning
hour
and
put
a
sigh
in
evening
gentle
wind
and
touched
with
frost
life
opening
flower
and
turned
to
poverty
the
proffered
wealth
in
hands
that
wrought
his
sickness
and
his
health
and
she
in
service
found
a
hidden
way
to
strange
new
meanings
in
the
eyes
of
life
and
reached
a
joy
beyond
the
shrill
affray
of
horns
and
harps
loud
with
the
songs
of
strife
or
little
triumphs
of
a
passing
day
and
grasped
in
giving
life
most
perfect
gift
love
that
is
raised
by
that
which
it
doth
lift
so
moved
the
twain
through
sunshine
barred
with
gloom
finding
in
each
twin
solace
and
despair
he
like
a
frail
and
gently
tended
bloom
grudged
each
day
health
that
took
him
past
her
care
and
she
by
approaching
doom
watching
his
need
of
her
grow
less
and
less
sickened
with
grief
her
lips
dare
not
express
tossed
thus
on
hidden
billows
of
the
soul
and
swept
by
winds
that
warred
against
the
will
they
drained
the
little
draught
in
life
poor
bowl
and
all
unwitting
wrought
each
other
ill
until
at
last
stung
past
the
heart
control
marking
etain
white
brow
and
pensive
eye
thus
ailill
broke
the
silence
with
a
cry
o
bitter
joy
o
sorrow
passing
sweet
o
blossoming
life
that
leads
to
love
pale
death
o
gain
that
speeds
to
loss
on
laggard
feet
o
living
voice
that
kills
the
word
it
saith
o
cooling
touch
that
kindles
quenchless
heat
how
shall
i
all
my
heart
dear
burden
speak
or
how
keep
silence
at
thy
paling
cheek
i
love
thee
queen
etain
but
in
such
wise
as
never
man
loved
woman
heretofore
not
with
the
love
that
lives
upon
her
eyes
and
counts
her
breast
the
summit
and
the
shore
of
all
desire
and
with
tempestuous
sighs
flings
to
the
winds
the
spoils
of
reason
thrift
in
barter
for
her
body
utmost
gift
my
love
o
queen
is
that
serener
kind
whose
word
outruns
the
lumbering
wain
of
speech
and
springs
in
light
from
mind
to
answering
mind
and
takes
its
bliss
beyond
the
body
reach
thought
mixed
with
thought
as
sunlight
with
sweet
wind
and
crowds
the
ways
where
human
sorrow
pleads
with
generations
of
exalted
deeds
ah
then
take
back
the
life
that
thou
hast
spent
in
vain
since
thou
dost
slay
and
heal
my
heart
and
let
quick
death
beat
down
my
failing
tent
and
its
lone
habitant
be
blown
apart
through
the
wide
wastes
of
night
black
firmament
where
move
the
powers
in
whose
dread
hands
may
be
the
source
and
end
of
dreams
and
destiny
there
past
the
chain
of
hours
my
faithful
ghost
may
through
thy
dreams
move
silently
and
dim
and
needing
then
the
least
may
serve
thee
most
or
crying
seaward
from
life
misty
rim
call
forth
thy
heart
beyond
its
mortal
coast
happy
if
in
thy
spirit
wakening
sigh
my
name
one
murmured
moment
live
and
die
thus
ailill
spoke
and
like
a
summer
shower
his
eager
words
tingling
on
heart
and
brain
stirred
many
a
leaf
to
life
and
many
a
flower
and
sank
beneath
her
spirit
thirsty
plain
till
hidden
springs
touched
with
a
strange
new
power
welled
in
her
eyes
with
flash
of
sudden
streams
from
hills
that
crowned
some
world
of
dreams
in
her
meditative
eye
rolled
the
great
world
and
lo
a
silent
moth
shredded
its
mighty
frame
till
down
the
sky
it
fluttered
like
a
poor
discarded
cloth
from
some
dead
face
flung
out
by
hands
that
die
and
thinned
like
vapours
round
the
lips
of
day
and
like
a
breath
passed
utterly
away
and
as
it
passed
she
knew
that
nevermore
life
would
be
life
again
yet
in
her
mind
lurked
the
dim
fear
of
one
who
leaves
the
shore
and
on
the
sightless
hazard
of
the
wind
moves
into
doubt
and
darkness
and
she
turned
her
thought
till
softly
on
her
ear
there
broke
a
song
a
bard
was
chanting
near
the
strong
are
fallen
low
who
deems
that
strength
himself
is
slain
through
depth
and
height
his
arm
shall
go
and
he
shall
rear
his
house
again
although
the
strong
are
fallen
the
living
all
are
dead
who
deems
that
life
has
found
a
grave
among
the
stars
she
lifts
her
head
she
dances
lightly
on
the
wave
although
the
living
all
are
the
beautiful
has
passed
was
beauty
but
a
passing
word
behold
the
dust
through
chaos
cast
with
lovelier
loveliness
is
stirred
although
the
beautiful
has
if
earth
lovers
love
amiss
who
deems
that
love
has
perished
quite
lo
cloudy
lips
the
mountains
kiss
and
day
is
bosomed
on
the
night
although
earth
lovers
love
swiftly
and
silently
her
thought
faint
wing
sought
between
wind
and
wind
a
certain
way
for
one
was
keen
with
glad
awakening
in
perfumed
morn
of
some
ecstatic
day
and
one
was
loud
with
song
and
quivering
string
and
all
life
pageantry
and
noisy
breath
wherewith
men
strive
to
drown
the
voice
of
death
then
said
etain
king
eochaidh
in
his
might
drew
me
to
bonds
of
happiness
but
thou
art
as
a
voice
that
calls
across
the
night
to
where
some
dawn
blows
freshly
on
the
brow
and
love
with
love
moves
freely
as
the
light
mingling
in
happy
dreams
their
shadowy
wings
beyond
these
perishing
substantial
things
ah
me
the
pain
in
joy
the
joy
in
grief
who
tells
the
end
when
once
has
moved
the
foot
thy
hand
is
on
my
life
leaf
who
knows
the
hand
may
pluck
its
ripened
fruit
to
thee
and
past
the
journey
may
be
brief
yet
i
the
king
behest
shall
all
fulfil
withhold
to
heal
my
brother
so
in
the
gaze
of
dawn
and
wondering
flowers
we
shall
keep
tryst
by
stream
and
whispering
tree
perchance
to
win
from
life
controlling
powers
the
healing
of
thy
heart
infirmity
perchance
oh
speed
the
hazard
of
those
hours
he
cried
that
blind
the
flame
of
low
desire
in
the
white
light
of
love
transmuting
fire
v
hard
by
the
star
the
moon
sheds
golden
dust
on
waves
of
day
that
ebb
into
the
deep
beyond
life
wan
lagoon
the
spider
night
now
spins
his
monstrous
web
and
spots
the
dark
with
many
a
pale
cocoon
hung
in
his
vaporous
cave
whose
phantoms
creep
in
visions
round
the
heavy
brain
of
sleep
yet
one
among
the
sleepers
never
turns
to
ease
his
shoulder
of
the
weight
of
night
but
with
the
shield
of
sweet
oblivion
spurns
those
wandering
shafts
that
tease
with
sound
and
sight
till
in
a
quiet
deep
as
kingly
urns
in
buried
places
ailill
deadly
lies
blind
to
the
spreading
signal
of
the
skies
now
the
thick
dark
that
pressed
etain
calm
face
like
softest
wool
thins
out
and
moves
and
lifts
and
like
a
memory
vague
recovered
trace
the
silent
world
looming
through
cloudy
rifts
floats
greyly
on
the
grey
abyss
of
space
then
slowly
forms
and
stands
at
last
in
light
built
on
the
crumbled
ruins
of
the
night
soon
on
a
cloud
with
heliotrope
day
harp
is
lifted
wire
on
golden
wire
and
now
great
dagda
burning
fingers
grope
from
string
to
string
then
reaching
high
and
higher
unto
the
utterance
of
some
eager
hope
break
through
the
vibrant
silences
and
spring
into
one
living
voice
of
leaf
and
wing
somewhere
the
snipe
now
taps
his
tiny
drum
the
moth
goes
fluttering
upward
from
the
heath
and
where
no
lightest
foot
unmarked
may
come
the
rabbit
tiptoe
plies
his
shiny
teeth
on
luscious
herbage
and
with
strident
hum
the
yellow
bees
blustering
from
flower
to
flower
scatter
from
cups
a
sparkling
shower
the
meadowsweet
shakes
out
its
feathery
mass
and
rumorous
winds
that
stir
the
silent
eaves
bearing
abroad
faint
perfumes
as
they
pass
thrill
with
some
wondrous
tale
the
fluttering
leaves
and
whisper
secretly
along
the
grass
where
gossamers
for
day
triumphal
march
hang
out
from
blade
to
blade
their
diamond
arch
forth
came
etain
and
with
a
little
cry
scattered
the
councils
of
the
feathery
brood
and
faced
unblenched
the
red
sun
winkless
eye
that
hung
above
the
quivering
wood
and
passed
with
stately
step
and
head
on
high
toward
a
secluded
place
where
one
doth
wait
silent
and
imperturbable
as
fate
sweetly
the
wizard
palms
of
morning
sleek
her
brow
with
spells
and
when
a
butterfly
brushes
with
soft
familiar
wing
her
cheek
through
the
deep
woods
she
hears
a
ghostly
sigh
as
if
a
hidden
god
were
fain
to
speak
an
ancient
ageless
love
that
fold
by
fold
wraps
her
with
joy
in
throbbing
arms
of
old
now
is
her
sandalled
foot
upon
the
edge
of
a
stream
that
flings
its
damp
to
cool
the
sorrel
shaking
on
its
ledge
under
the
squirrel
pine
and
in
a
swamp
goes
dumb
among
the
sedge
where
the
swift
kingfisher
a
moment
seen
flashes
and
fades
a
flame
of
sudden
green
at
length
she
stands
within
the
appointed
place
where
leafy
boughs
in
odorous
dusk
are
blent
but
wherefore
now
across
her
tranc√©d
face
pass
the
quick
fingers
of
bewilderment
and
doubt
on
doubt
like
shadows
shadows
chase
faintly
she
speaks
ailill
i
came
to
see
who
art
thou
for
thou
art
yet
art
not
he
from
her
soft
eye
no
loosened
glances
tell
desire
or
dread
to
him
whose
cloudless
gaze
knows
from
what
heights
of
old
her
footsteps
fell
out
of
clear
light
into
this
web
of
days
and
nights
and
mystery
inscrutable
and
marks
how
in
the
calm
of
inner
power
she
moves
unmoved
to
meet
her
destined
hour
etain
he
whispered
and
again
etain
such
utter
love
went
throbbing
through
her
name
that
nigh
beyond
her
doubt
her
foot
had
gone
yet
stood
she
wavering
like
a
lonely
flame
outburning
night
that
feels
the
shake
of
dawn
then
said
thy
name
that
doubt
aside
he
cast
mider
he
answered
come
for
thee
at
last
mider
she
echoed
mider
and
the
sound
smote
upon
hidden
doors
and
roused
from
sleep
faint
eyes
that
dreamed
vague
hands
that
groped
around
the
thought
behind
her
thought
and
from
the
deep
beneath
her
thought
climbed
upward
to
the
bound
whose
shadowy
marge
like
midnight
gloom
is
cast
between
the
passing
moment
and
the
past
then
mider
said
for
no
poor
worm
desire
nor
aught
of
earth
thou
comest
o
beloved
but
for
another
good
thy
thoughts
conspire
and
far
from
self
thy
feet
have
hither
moved
to
the
high
purpose
of
the
sacred
fire
that
burns
thine
upward
path
through
joy
and
pain
through
birth
through
life
through
death
to
me
again
then
asked
she
all
bewildered
who
art
thou
whose
eyes
have
read
my
soul
and
answered
he
thine
am
i
by
the
immemorial
vow
that
made
thee
mine
beloved
eternally
when
for
a
on
thy
peerless
brow
i
set
a
diadem
beyond
the
worth
of
all
the
crowns
of
all
the
queens
of
earth
swiftly
her
thought
divining
where
and
when
and
wherefore
parted
thou
beloved
shalt
know
that
land
which
gleams
in
the
rapt
poet
ken
set
in
a
sea
that
has
no
ebb
or
flow
beyond
the
of
the
dreams
of
men
is
mine
and
from
all
changings
far
withdrawn
there
spreads
the
realm
of
mider
and
etain
and
there
we
loved
till
that
almighty
power
who
set
the
heavens
wheeling
with
a
nod
blew
thee
a
butterfly
from
flower
to
flower
until
beyond
our
realm
a
splendid
god
knew
thee
and
cherished
in
a
blossomy
bower
and
nightly
thy
fair
form
in
purple
laid
and
at
thy
side
his
couch
of
slumber
made
but
thee
again
the
breath
of
tempest
found
and
swept
thee
forth
and
whirled
from
field
to
field
and
dashed
thee
where
a
roar
of
festal
sound
shook
brazenly
doffed
helm
and
resting
shield
and
flung
thee
in
a
cup
that
passed
around
to
one
who
drank
it
deep
in
bridal
mirth
and
thou
wert
born
a
daughter
of
the
earth
from
year
to
year
life
pleasures
round
thee
played
and
fell
behind
the
question
of
thine
eyes
that
searched
the
mysteries
of
leafy
shade
and
the
blue
heron
sailing
in
the
skies
cutting
the
silence
with
the
rusty
blade
his
voice
and
sought
to
spy
the
subtile
might
that
killed
your
gathered
iris
in
a
night
ah
soon
i
saw
sweet
longing
on
thy
face
and
love
compelling
poppy
on
thy
mouth
and
watched
thee
robe
thy
maiden
blossoming
grace
and
dream
a
king
came
riding
from
the
south
yet
in
thy
sigh
in
eochaidh
royal
place
unseen
i
saw
the
waft
of
hidden
wings
set
past
these
perishing
substantial
things
for
thou
wert
born
for
love
whose
windless
sail
moves
on
great
deeps
beyond
life
shallow
range
love
linked
in
flesh
with
failing
flesh
shall
fail
love
knit
in
thought
with
changing
thought
shall
change
nor
all
desire
against
slow
time
prevail
for
that
old
worm
all
dreams
shall
gnaw
and
rend
and
love
that
finds
an
end
itself
shall
end
oh
not
for
thee
the
little
irking
chain
that
frets
the
bark
on
life
expanding
bole
nor
love
that
maketh
free
though
it
contain
all
earth
white
loves
and
thee
supreme
and
sole
beloved
beneath
all
heaven
for
who
shall
gain
since
between
love
and
love
most
subtly
mixed
untrodden
silence
stands
forever
fixed
my
love
would
brood
upon
the
holy
thing
within
thine
inmost
being
folded
far
till
it
at
length
come
forth
on
perfect
wing
to
brush
with
sweet
eclipse
the
morning
star
and
in
high
heaven
its
utter
rapture
sing
filling
the
universe
with
golden
sound
of
love
immortal
measureless
unbound
how
shall
immortal
love
find
mortal
bliss
or
measureless
be
bound
in
narrow
speech
or
free
and
forge
the
bondage
of
a
kiss
nay
but
its
end
is
ever
out
of
reach
its
life
of
fairer
life
the
chrysalis
and
all
its
days
desirable
and
fleet
but
prints
of
unseen
beauty
passing
feet
ah
love
is
thine
whose
sun
burns
out
the
mystery
of
life
and
death
and
all
thine
hours
but
blossom
unto
one
that
us
in
utter
bondage
compasseth
now
to
that
timeless
hour
time
footsteps
run
to
rear
our
throne
whose
foot
shall
never
know
the
chafe
of
life
eternal
ebb
and
flow
and
he
whose
heart
long
time
was
scarred
and
swept
by
hungering
winds
that
robbed
him
of
repose
wrapt
in
deep
joy
beyond
his
joy
has
slept
into
a
passionless
calm
that
wakes
and
knows
love
highest
bliss
in
honour
stainless
kept
farewell
and
when
a
little
while
has
flown
i
come
again
he
ceased
she
stood
alone
far
through
the
morn
the
horn
of
eochaidh
blew
outspeeding
runners
hot
with
glad
return
from
post
to
post
goes
welcoming
halloo
far
off
the
shouldered
dance
and
burn
through
smother
of
wheels
and
marching
men
that
strew
their
wake
with
dust
and
song
and
storm
at
last
round
dun
and
liss
their
prosperous
journey
past
and
all
that
day
go
question
and
reply
twin
bodkins
looping
up
the
stuff
of
life
and
all
that
dusk
warm
cheek
and
glancing
eye
blow
up
love
ruddy
peat
in
man
and

and
all
that
night
harps

cry
around

she
now
the

doth

escaped
a

not

unspeakable
with

from

etain
the
sings
not

low
as
one
who
musing
waits
an
hour
whose
promise
in
her
deep
eye
springs
in
keen
transfiguring
light
that
contemplates
the
mystery
of
small
familiar
things
made
great
with
gleams
from
past
the
verge
of
sight
and
strange
with
rumours
of
the
infinite
in
that
bright
realm
glimpsed
through
the
shade
of
this
she
sees
great
peace
resolve
earth
little
strife
and
deepening
vision
sounds
a
deeper
bliss
till
joy
rolls
round
the
fretted
shores
of

in
swift
stroke
of
hate
and
love
long
kiss
she
marks

and

pass
her
days
in
labour
sped
with
peace
and
now
the

in
her
repose
gathers
warm
love
about
him
like
a
fleece
and
through
the
land
his
joy
goes
stirring
swift
hands
that
bid
the
earth
increase
her
gift
of
good

in

eochaidh
king
loudly
his

rolls
through
the
echoing

but
in
his
dreams
in
some
high
tourney
met
he
feels
a
strong
inexorable
hand
counter
his
craft
with
calm
unwavering
threat
by
an
unseen
player
planned
that
haunts
his

with
hint
of
some
deep
strife
waged
vastly
on

board
of
death

then
from

forth
goes
the

for
solace
mile
on
mile
his
happy
realms
in
dawn
pale
radiance
lie
secure
in
his
great
strength
so
with
a
smile
he
tramples
out
the
night
thin
troubling
cry
then
toward
his
palace
turns
lo
at
its
door
there
stands
a
chieftain
never
seen
before
straightly
he
stands
nor
from
his
pride
full
height
bends
he
from
neck
to
knee
one
purple
fold
nor
dips
his
spear
nor
casts
his
shield
whose
light
glinting
from
snowy
boss
and
bead
of
gold
strikes
from
the
king
some
memory
of
the
night
so
that
his

is
swift
to
trace
a
touch
of

behind

mystery
and
in
lone
hours
of
many
a
moonless
night
through
jetting
poplars
and
the
shooting
snags
of
wrinkled
oaks
the
king
doth
seek
a
light
from
his
heart
questionings
whose
purpose
flags
before
her
face
lest
in
her
eye
clear
sight
one
thought

should
bring
to

king
eochaidh
on
the
throne
of
erin
sits
around
his
footstool
press
high
cares
of
sovereignty
that
crowd
his
own
like
gossips
out
of
doors
and
ease
the
stress
of
storming
thought
which
held
from
question
clear
fears
its
mute
doubt
yet
vaguely
doubts
its
fear
in
silent
step
hushed
pulse
and
listening
gaze
he
marks
expectancy
behind
her
smile
like
some
faint
gleam
from
days
ere
the
high
gods
had
blown
them
to
this
isle
among
inscrutable
divided
ways
some
hidden
destiny
to
mar
or
make
in

as
strong
to
give
as
quick
to
take
now
to
the
king
the
hollow
moments
haste
across
his
heart
to
some
hour
and
now
he
frets
to
leap
with
sinews
braced
through
lagging
days
and
meet
the
threatening
power
yet
from
his
conflict
inner
lips
now
taste
the
mingled
wine
of
sweet
and
bitter
fate
strength
to
withstand
endurance
to
await
these
not
as
gifts
the
shadowy
troublers
bear
but
on
his
table
spread
what
is
his
own
so
mused
the
king
not
all
from
spade
and
share
the
harvest
comes
seed
to
its
fruit
has
grown
though
stirred
by
smart
of
sun
and
air
and
in
life
myriad
hands
beaten
and
pressed
man
is
not
made
but
man
made
manifest
so
finding
gain
in
threatened
loss
his
mind
through
sorrow
and
joy
makes
even
way
content
if
toiling
past
his
fingers
find
her
fingers
and
in
trembling
silence
say
here
in
unstable
circumstance
entwined
we
two
have
kissed
and
whither
we
may
tend
once
mixed
must
find
each
other
at
the
end
and
she
within
her
heart
most
secret
place
has
nursed
a
thought
that
grew
from
day
to
day
like
seed
that
on
a
rocky
face
finds
root
and
strength
to
shatter
ancient
sway
a
thought
of
love
that
chafes
at
time
and
space
and
moves
from
love
that
was
through
love
to
be
to
some
exalted
end
no
eye
can
see
yet
nought
of
this
was
uttered
each
to
each
but
when
like
forest
monarchs
strong
and
proud
a
silver
birch
beside
a
sinewy
beech
they
stood
at
feast
to
hail
the
gathering
crowd
swift
winds
of
joy
came
full
of
happy
speech
and
through
the
host
light
raptures
laughed
and
played
witless
of
yellowing
leaf
or
sodden
shade
then
came
a
day
when
on

slow

sideways
down

the
dread
omens
tell
the

speaks

so
softly
well
with
wondrous
beauty
all
his

is
drawn
in

to

her
from
the
coming
spell
pushed
past
its
hour
the
unspoken
doom
may
break
and
love
and
honour
stand
without
a
shake
on
windy

and

he
sets
his

where
the

of

clenched
in

stand
and
where

down

some

quivered
at

saw
in

way

then
when

and
you
upon

on

triumphant

one
stroke
another

with

crowned
your

down

the
keeners
keen
some
deep
and

slips
out
their
thin
shrill
cries

that
other

that
made
the
silence
ring

floats
along

out
before

thro
the
hushed

talk
that
fills
the

from

a
fire
from
your
high
altar
shines
and
kindles
thro
our
dusk
of
strife
a
faith
whose
inner
eye
divines
that
death
is
minister
to
life

all
our
years
a

in
one
great
mind
that
grasps
the

that

of
the

a

before

he
stretched
his
wings
to
fly
away
but
round
his
feet
the
oozy
clay
gripped
fast
and
held
him
to
the
ground
he
stretched
and
strove
until
a
sound
went
thro
him
from
he
knew
not
where
and
said
only
way
is
prayer
he
dropped
his
wings
and
raised
his
eyes
and
sent
his
soul
into
the
skies
he
prayed
and
prayed
and
as
he
prayed
a
wind
among
his
plumage
played
and
bore
him
upward
toward
his
sphere
around
his
feet
from
far
and
near
there
came
a
sound
that
seemed
to
say
on
pray
on
we
too
would
pray
thy
prayer
has
touched
the
sleeping
powers
pray
on
thy
prayer
shall
yet
be
ours
we
too
have
wings
that
pine
for
flight
we
too
have
eyes
that
long
for

upward
he
moved
and
still
his
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
distant
skies
and
as
he
rose
toward
heaven
dim
he
drew
the
earth
up
after
him
about
his
feet
the
oozy
clay
gripped
fast
but
could
not
stop
or
stay
his
course
till
on
his
skyey
stair
he
paused
beyond
the
need
for
prayer
while
from
the
air
beneath
around
there
rose
a
tumult
of
glad
sound
the
angel
turned
the
sound
to
seek
and
lo
his
foot
was
on
a
peak
that
fell
away
to
where
the
world
lay
like
a
painted
flag
unfurled
and
shaken
out
from
sea
to
sea
and
thus
the
mountains
came
to
be
so
said
the
bird
and
what
the
masque
of
meaning
hid
i
meant
to
ask
but
off
he
flew
before
i
knew
and
yet
i

the

is
true

hear
aright

vision

with
agony

laid
thee
down

from

wins
the
scoff
of

the

rather
is
