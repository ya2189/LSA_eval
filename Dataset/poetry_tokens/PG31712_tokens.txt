my

trod

were

awake
adream
shall
live
again
for
me
those
hours
when
in

mystery

gleam
i
met
her
the
talismanic
heliotrope
beneath
mesmeric
lashes
where
the
sorceries
of
love
and
hope
had
made
a
shining
daydawn
brows
whereover
hung
the
twilight
of
dark
locks
and
lips
whose
beauty
spoke
the
rose
tongue
of
will
not
tell
of
cheeks
and
chin
that
held
me
as
sweet
language
holds
nor

the
eloquence
within
her
bosom
moony
of
her
large
limbs
languorous
that
glanced
like
starlight
through
her
ardent
robe
diaphanous
web

the

is
no
star
so
pure
and
high
as
was
her
look
no

shall

under

dance

of
the
of
the
rain
and

oft
the
satyr
spirit
of
the
spring
called
and
the
of
thy
sap
made
answer
and
thy
sunken
veins
grew
vehement
with
youth
whose
pressure
swelled
thy
gnarly
muscles
and
the
germs
deep
down
in
darkness
rooted
bubbled
green
from
all
thy
million
oilets
where
the
spirits
of

made

toilets
or
within
thy
stately
shadow
footed
oft
the
hours
of
blonde
summer
tinkled
at

windows
of
thy

and
found
thee
or
with
shapely
bodies
twinkled
lissom
feet
of
naked
flowers
around
thee
where
thy
mats
of
moss
lay
and
the
autumn
with
his
troop
of
days
beneath
thy
branches
rested
and
dark
of
eye
and
throated
songs
of
hunting
or
with
red
hand
tested
every
that
above
him
floated
then
the
winter
but
rich
in
shaggy
followers
of
frost
and
freezing
made
the
floor
of
thy
broad
boughs
his
kitchen
to
camp
in
grimly
easing
limbs
and
moccasoned
with
lichen
now
alas
no

these
invest
thee

the
dignity
of

gladness
they
unto

thou
once
confessed
thee
of

now
know
thee
not

sits
beside
thee
where
forgot
dost
rest
thee
the
haunted
woodland
here
in
the
golden
darkness
and
green
night
of
the
woods
a
flitting
form
i
follow
a
shadow
that
eludes
or
is
it
but
the
phantom
of
former
forest
moods
the
phantom
of
some
fancy
i
knew
when
i
was
young
and
in
my
dreaming
boyhood
the
wildwood
among
young
face
to
face
with
faery
spoke
in
no
unknown
tongue
blue
were
her
eyes
and
golden
the
nimbus
of
her
hair
and
crimson
as
a
flower
her
mouth
that
kissed
me
there
that
kissed
and
bade
me
follow
and
smiled
away
my
care
a
magic
and
a
marvel
lived
in
her
word
and
look
as
down
among
the
blossoms
she
sate
me
by
the
brook
and
read
me
in
nature
story
book
loved
forgotten
she
never
reads
again
of
beautiful
enchantments
that
haunt
the
sun
and
rain
and
in
the
wind
and
water
chant
a
mysterious
strain
and
so
i
search
the
forest
wherein
my
spirit
feels
in
tree
or
stream
or
flower
herself
she
still
conceals
but
now
she
flies
who
followed
whom
earth
no
more
reveals
discovery
what
is
it
now
that
i
shall
seek
where
woods
dip
downward
in
the
hills
a
mossy
nook
a
ferny
creek
and
may
among
the
daffodils
or
in
the
valley
vistaed
glow
past
rocks
of
terraced
shall
i
behold
her
coming
slow
sweet
may
among
the
columbines
with
redbud
cheeks
and
bluet
eyes
big
eyes
the
homes
of
happiness
to
meet
me
with
the
old
surprise
her
hoiden
hair
all
bonnetless
who
waits
for
me
where
note
for
note
the
birds
make
glad
the
a
dogwood
blossom
at
her
throat
my
may
among
the
anemones
as
sweetheart
breezes
kiss
the
blooms
and
dewdrops
drink
the
moonlight
gleams
my
soul
shall
kiss
her
lips
perfumes
and
drink
the
magic
of
her
dreams
comradery
with
eyes
he
looks
into
the
morning
face
then
turns
away
with
schoolboy
feet
all
wet
with
dew
out
for
a
holiday
the
hill
brook
sings
incessant
stars
on
its
restless
breast
and
where
he
wades
its
its
song
is
happiest
a
comrade
of
the
chinquapin
he
looks
into
its
knotted
eyes
and
sees
its
heart
and
deep
within
its
soul
that
makes
him
wise
the
knows
and
follows
him
who
whistles
up
the
birds
and
bees
and
him
all
the
perfumes
swim
of
woodland
loam
and
trees
he
pass
the
supple
sing
the
flowers
awake
and
sappy
lips
of
things
laugh
ripe
each
fruited
brake
his
touch
is
a
companionship
his
word
an
old
authority
he
comes
a
lyric
at
his
lip
unstudied
poesy
occult
unto
the
soul
companionship
of
things
that
only
seem
to
be
earth
points
with
magic
fingertip
and
bids
thee
see
how
fancy
keeps
thee
company
for
oft
at
dawn
hast
not
beheld
a
spirit
of
prismatic
hue
blow
wide
the
buds
which
night
has
swelled
and
stain
them
through
with
ethereal
gold
and
blue
while
at
her
side
another
went
with
gleams
of
enigmatic
white
a
spirit
who
distributes
scent
to
vale
and
height
in
footsteps
of
the
rosy
light
and
oft
at
dusk
hast
thou
not
seen
the
bring
their
caravans
of
dew
and
glitter
all
the
green
night
shadow
tans
from
many
starbeam
nor
watched
with
these
the
elfins
go
who
tune
faint
instruments
whose
sound
is
that
insects
blow
when
all
the
ground
sleeps
and
the
night
is
hushed
around
i
the
spirits
of
the
forest
that
to
the
winds
give
voice
i
lie
the
livelong
april
day
and
wonder
what
it
is
they
say
that
makes
the
leaves
rejoice
the
spirits
of
the
forest
that
breathe
in
bud
and
bloom
i
walk
within
the
brake
and
wonder
how
it
is
they
make
the
bubbles
of
perfume
the
spirits
of
the
forest
that
live
in
every
spring
i
lean
above
the
brook
bright
blue
and
wonder
what
it
is
they
do
that
makes
the
water
sing
the
spirits
of
the
forest
that
haunt
the
sun
green
glow
down
fungus
ways
of
fern
i
steal
and
wonder
what
they
can
conceal
in
dews
that
twinkles
so
the
spirits
of
the
forest
they
hold
me
heart
and
hand
and
oh
the
bird
they
send
by
light
the
gleam
by
night
to
guide
to
fairyland
ii
the
time
when
violets
hold
up
inverted
horns
of
gold
the
elvish
cups
that
spring
upsets
with
dripping
feet
when
april
wets
the
wold
is
come
and
by
each
leafing
way
the
sorrel
drops
pale
blots
of
pink
and
like
an
angled
star
a
fay
sets
on
her
forehead
pallid
day
the
blossoms
of
the
trillium
wink
within
the
vale
by
rock
and
stream
a
fragile
fairy
porcelain
blue
as
a
baby
eyes
the
bluets
blow
and
gleam
in
gleam
the
flash
with
rain
it
is
the
time
to
cast
off
care
to
make
glad
intimates
of
these
the
sunbeam
laughing
there
the
wind
that
bids
us
share
the
optimism
of
the
trees
iii
the
white
ghosts
of
the
flowers
the
green
ghosts
of
the
trees
they
haunt
the
blooming
bowers
they
haunt
the
wildwood
hours
and
whisper
in
the
breeze
for
in
the
wildrose
places
and
on
the
beechen
knoll
my
soul
hath
seen
their
faces
my
soul
hath
met
their
races
and
felt
their
dim
control
iv
buds
whose
bells
the
mouth
of
april
kissed
that
hang
like
rosy
shells
around
a
naiad
wrist
pink
as
mist
and
buds
whose
dark
deep
auburn
blossoms
shake
on
boughs
as
the
bark
a
dryad
eyes
awake
brown
as
a
midnight
lake
these
with
symbolic
blooms
of
and
i
found
among
the
glooms
of
woods
and
rocks
lairs
of
the
mink
and
fox
the
beetle
in
the
brush
the
bird
about
the
creek
the
bee
within
the
hush
and
i
whose
heart
was
meek
stood
still
to
hear
these
speak
the
language
that
records
in
the
hieroglyphic
words
of
beauty
who
enspells
the
world
and
aye
compels
the
wind
at
night
i
not
till
the
wildman
wind
is
shrill
howling
upon
the
hill
in
every
wolfish
tree
whose
boisterous
boughs
like
desperate
arms
gesture
and
beat
the
night
and
down
huge
clouds
in
chasms
of
stormy
white
the
frightened
moon
hurries
above
the
house
shall
i
lie
down
and
deep
letting
the
mad
wind
keep
its
shouting
revel
round
me
fall
asleep
ii
not
till
its
dark
halloo
is
hushed
and
where
wild
waters
rushed
like
some
hoofed
terror
underneath
its
whip
and
spur
of
foam
remains
a
ghostly
glass
whereover
stains
of
moony
mists
and
rains
and
stealthy
starbeams
like
vague
specters
slip
shall
i
with
thoughts
that
take
unto
themselves
the
ache
of
silence
as
a
sound
from
sleep
awake
airy
tongues
i
hear
a
song
the
wet
leaves
lisp
when
morn
comes
down
the
woodland
way
and
misty
as
a
her
gown
gleams
windy
gray
a
song
that
seems
to
say
awake
is
day
i
hear
a
sigh
when
day
sits
down
beside
the
lagoon
while
on
her
glistening
hair
and
gown
the
rose
of
rest
is
strewn
a
sigh
that
seems
to
croon
come
sleep
is
noon
i
hear
a
whisper
when
the
stars
upon
some
height
crown
the
dead
day
with
nenuphars
of
dreamy
gold
and
white
a
voice
that
seems
t
invite
come
love
is
night
ii
before
the
rathe
sings
among
the
hawtrees
in
the
lane
and
to
the
wind
the
locust
flings
its
early
clusters
fresh
with
rain
beyond
the
that
swings
its
rose
of
fire
above
the
spire
between
the
morning
watchet
wings
a
voice
that
rings
brooks
and
boughs
arouse
arouse
before
the
first
brown
owlet
cries
among
the
on
the
hill
and
in
the
dam
with
eyes
the
lilies
rock
above
the
mill
beyond
the
oblong
moon
that
flies
its
pearly
flower
above
the
tower
between
the
twilight
primrose
skies
a
voice
that
sighs
from
east
to
west
to
rest
to
rest
the
hills
there
is
no
joy
of
earth
that
thrills
my
bosom
like
the
hills
th
unchanging
hills
that
shadowy
beckon
our
mutability
to
follow
and
to
gaze
upon
foundations
of
the
dusk
and
dawn
meseems
the
very
heavens
are
massed
upon
their
shoulders
vague
and
vast
with
all
the
skyey
burden
of
the
winds
and
clouds
and
stars
above
lo
how
they
sit
before
us
seeing
the
laws
that
give
all
beauty
being
behold
to
them
when
dawn
is
near
the
nomads
of
the
air
appear
unfolding
crimson
camps
of
day
in
brilliant
bands
then
march
away
and
under
burning
battlements
of
twilight
plant
their
tinted
tents
the
faith
of
olden
myths
that
brood
by
haunted
stream
and
haunted
wood
they
see
and
feel
the
happiness
of
old
at
which
we
only
guess
the
dreams
the
ancients
loved
and
knew
still
as
their

an
embodied
form
giving
to
solitude
the
charm
of
leaves
and
waters
and
the
peace
of
melodies
and
who
at

doth
still
confer
with

telleth

pale
tale
of
lonely
love

spring
first
came
the
rain
loud
with
sonorous
lips
a
pursuivant
who
heralded
a
prince
and
dawn
put
on
a
livery
of
tints
and
dusk
bound
gold
about
her
hair
and
hips
and
all
in
silver
mail
then
sunlight
came
a
knight
who
bade
the
winter
let
him
pass
and
freed
imprisoned
beauty
naked
as
the
court
of
love
in
all
her
wildflower
shame
and
so
she
came
in
loveliness
across
the
hills
and
bent
down
to
bless
before
her
face
the
birds
were
as
a
lyre
and
at
her
feet
like
some
strong
worshiper
the
shouting
water
p√¶an
praise
of
her
who
with
blue
eyes
set
the
wild
world
on
fire
response
there
is
a
music
of
immaculate
love
that
breathes
within
the
virginal
veins
of
spring
and
trillium
blossoms
like
the
stars
that
cling
to
fairies
wands
and
strung
on
sprays
above
and
mandrake
blooms
that
look
enough
like
the
elves

and
all
of
the
woods
are
born
thereof
there
is
no
sod
spring
white
foot
brushes
but
must
feel
the
music
that
vibrates
within
and
thrill
to
the
communicated
touch
responsive
harmonies
that
must
unshut
the
heart
of
beauty
for
song
concrete
kin
emotions
that
be
flowers
born

yes
there

in

upward

god

transformation
it
is
the
time
when
by
the
forest
falls
the
touchmenots
hang
fairy
when
ferns
and
flowers
fill
the
lichened
laps
of
rocks
with
color
rich
as
orient
shawls
and
in
my
heart
i
hear
a
voice
that
calls
me
woodward
where
the
hamadryad
wraps
her
limbs
in
bark
or
bubbling
in
the
saps
laughs
the
sweet
greek
of
pan
old
madrigals
there
is
a
gleam
that
lures
me
up
the
stream
a
naiad
swimming
with
wet
limbs
of
light
perfume
that
leads
me
on
from
dream
to
dream
an
oread
footprints
fragrant
with
her
flight
and
lo
meseems
i
am
a
faun
again
part
of
the
myths
that
i
pursue
in
vain
omens
sad
the
hills
the
poppy
sunset
died
slow
as
a
fungus
breaking
through
the
crusts
of
forest
leaves
the
waning
thrusts
through
clouds
one
milky
silver
side
in
her
vague
light
the
dogwoods
seem
nervous
torches
flourished
by
the
gusts
the
seem
the
restless
dusts
of
mists
upon
the
hills
they
hide
it
is
a
night
of
omens
whom
late
may
meets
like
a
wraith
among
her
train
of
hours
an
apparition
with
appealing
eye
and
hesitant
foot
that
walks
a
willowed
way
and
speaking
through
the
fading
moon
and
flowers
bids
her
prepare
her
gentle
soul
to
die
abandoned
the
hornets
build
in
rooms
and
on
its
mossy
porch
the
lizard
lies
around
its
chimneys
slow
the
swallow
flies
and
on
its
roof
the
locusts
snow
their
blooms
like
some
sad
thought
that
broods
here
old
perfumes
haunt
its
dim
stairs
the
cautious
zephyr
tries
each
gusty
door
like
some
dead
hand
then
sighs
with
ghostly
lips
among
the
attic
glooms
and
now
a
heron
now
a
kingfisher
flits
in
the
willows
where
the
riffle
seems
at
each
faint
fall
to
hesitate
to
leap
fluttering
the
silence
with
a
little
stir
here
summer
seems
a
placid
face
asleep
and
the
near
world
a
figment
of
her
dreams
the
calling
the
heron
flies
athwart
the
blue
that
sleeps
above
it
reach
on
rocky
reach
of
water
sings
by
sycamore
and
beech
in
whose
warm
shade
bloom
lilies
not
a
few
it
is
a
page
whereon
the
sun
and
dew
scrawl
sparkling
words
in
dawn
delicious
speech
a
laboratory
where
the
teach
dissect
each
scent
and
analyze
each
hue
not
otherwise
than
beautiful
doth
it
record
the
of
each
summer
day
where
we
may
read
as
in
a
catalogue
when
passed
a
thresher
when
a
load
of
hay
or
when
a
rabbit
or
a
bird
that
lit
and
now
a
truant
and
his
dog
the
covered
bridge
there
from
its
entrance
lost
in
matted
vines
where
in
the
valley
foams
a
is
glimpsed
a
ruined
mill
remaining
wall
here
by
the
road
the
oxeye
daisy
mines
hot
brass
and
bronze
the
shines
red
as
the
plumage
of
the
cardinal
faint
from
the
forest
comes
the
call
where
dusty
summer
dreams
among
the
pines
this
is
the
spot
where
spring
writes
wildflower
verses
in
primrose
pink
while
drowsing
his
reins
the
ploughman
all
unnoticing
plods
along
and
where
the
autumn
opens
weedy
purses
of
sleepy
silver
while
the
wains
rumble
the
bridge
like
some
deep
throat
of
song
the
hillside
grave
deep
the
drifted
daisies
break
here
at
the
hill
foot
on
its
top
the
wheat
hangs
and
in
vague
retreat
the
blooms
of
the
shake
and
where
the
drops
a
crimson
flake
and
like
young
lips
make
sweet
the
shaded
hush
low
in
the
honeyed
heat
the
hum
as
if
afraid
to
wake
one
sleeping
there
with
no
white
stone
to
tell
the
story
of
existence
but
the
stem
of
one
towering
brier
and
weed
where
all
the
day
the
requiem
within
whose
shade
the
timid
violets
spell
an
epitaph
only
the
stars
can
read
simulacra
dark
in
the
west
the
sunset
somber
wrack
unrolled
vast
walls
the
rams
of
war
had
split
along
whose
battlements
the
battle
lit
tempestuous
beacons
and
with
gates
hurled
back
a
mighty
city
red
with
ruin
and
sack
through
burning
breaches
crumbling
bit
by
bit
showed
where
the
god
of
slaughter
seemed
to
sit
with
conflagration
glaring
at
each
crack
who
knows
perhaps
as
sleep
unto
us
makes
our
dreams
as
real
as
our
waking
seems
with
recollections
time
can
not
destroy
so
in
the
mind
of
nature
now
awakes
haply
some
wilder
memory
and
she
dreams
the
stormy
story
of
the
fall
of
troy
before
the
end
how
does
the
autumn
in
her
mind
conclude
the
tragic
masque
her
frosty
pencil
writes
broad
on
the
pages
of
the
days
and
nights
in
burning
lines
of
orchard
wold
and
wood
what
lonelier
forms
that
at
the
year
door
stood
at
spectral
wait
with
wildly
wasted
lights
shall
enter
and
with
melancholy
rites
inaugurate
their
sadder
sisterhood
sorrow
who
lifts
a
signal
hand
and
slow
the
green
leaf
fevers
falling
ere
it
dies
regret
whose
pale
lips
summon
and
gaunt
woe
wakes
the
harps
with
sonorous
sighs
and
sleep
who
sits
with
poppied
eyes
and
sees
the
earth
and
sky
grow
winter
the
flute
whence
autumn
misty
drew
music
ripening
the
pinched
kernels
in
the
burly
chestnut
and
the
chinquapin
the
oval
haws
and
hips
now
winter
crushes
to
his
stormy
lips
and
surly
songs
whistle
around
his
chin
now
the
wild
days
and
wilder
nights
begin
when
at
the
eaves
the
crooked
icicle
drips
thy
songs
o
autumn
are
not
lost
so
soon
still
dwells
a
memory
in
thy
hollow
flute
which
unto
winter
masculine
airs
doth
give
thy
own
creative
qualities
of
tune
by
which
we
see
each
bough
bend
white
with
fruit
each
bush
with
bloom
in
snow
commemorative
the
frail
eidolons
of
all
blossoms
spring
year
after
year
about
the
forest
tossed
the
magic
touch
of
the
enchanter
frost
back
from
the
heaven
of
the
doth
bring
each
branch
and
bush
in
silence
visiting
with
phantom
beauty
of
its
blooms
long
lost
each
dead
weed
bends
of
its
ghost
each
dead
flower
stands
ghostly
with
blossoming
this
is
the
nature
tells
to
the
gray
moon
and
mist
a
winter
night
the
which
her
weird
fancy
with
all
the
glamour
of
her
soul
delight
before
the
summoning
sorcery
of
her
eyes
making
her
spirit
dream
materialize
the
winter
moon
deep
in
the
dell
i
watched
her
as
she
rose
a
face
of
icy
fire
the
hills
with
eyes
to
freeze
the
forest
rills
and
feet
to
bleach
the
meadow
snows
pale
as
some
young
witch
who
goes
to
her
first
meeting
with
the
fiend
whose
fears
fix
demon
eyes
behind
each
bush
she
nears
stops
yet
must
on
fearful
of
following
foes
and
so
i
chased
her
startled
in
the
wood
like
a
discovered
oread
who
flies
the
faun
who
found
her
sleeping
each
nude
limb
glittering
betrayal
through
the
solitude
till
in
a
frosty
cloud
i
saw
her
swim
like
a
drowned
face
a
blur
beneath
the
ice
in
summer
when
in
dry
hollows
hilled
with
hay
the
sings
afar
and
golden
gray
dusk
dies
away
beneath
the
amber
there
where
a
warm
and
shadowy
arm
the
woodland
lays
around
the
farm
to
meet
you
where
we
kissed
dear
heart
to
kiss
you
at
the
tryst
dear
heart
to
kiss
you
at
the
tryst
when
clover
fields
smell
cool
with
dew
and
crickets
cry
and
roads
are
still
and
faint
and
few
the
strew
the
dark
where
calls
the
whippoorwill
there
in
the
lane
where
sweet
again
the
petals
of
the
rain
to
stroll
with
head
to
head
dear
heart
and
say
the
words
oft
said
dear
heart
and
say
the
words
oft
said
rain
and
wind
i
hear
the
hoofs
of
horses
galloping
over
the
hill
galloping
on
and
galloping
on
when
all
the
night
is
shrill
with
wind
and
rain
that
beats
the
pane
and
my
soul
with
awe
is
still
for
every
dripping
window
their
headlong
rush
makes
bound
galloping
up
and
galloping
by
then
back
again
and
around
till
the
gusty
roofs
ring
with
their
hoofs
and
the
draughty
cellars
sound
and
then
i
hear
black
horsemen
hallooing
in
the
night
hallooing
and
hallooing
they
ride
vale
and
height
and
the
branches
snap
and
the
shutters
clap
with
the
fury
of
their
flight
then
at
each
door
a
horseman
with
burly
bearded
lip
hallooing
through
the
keyhole
pauses
with
cloak
and
the
shakes
and
the
panel
quakes
the
anger
of
his
whip
all
night
i
hear
their
gallop
and
their
wild
halloo
alarm
the
sound
and
vanes
go
round
in
forest
and
on
farm
but
never
a
hair
of
a
thing
is
there
only
the
wind
and
storm
under
arcturus
i
i
belt
the
morn
with
ribboned
mist
with
baldricked
blue
i
gird
the
noon
and
dusk
with
purple
with
the
hunter
moon
these
follow
me
the
season
says
mine
is
the
hand
that
packs
their
scrips
and
speeds
them
on
their
ways
with
gipsy
gold
that
weighs
their
backs
ii
a
daybreak
horn
the
autumn
blows
as
with
a
band
he
parts
wet
boughs
whereon
the
berry
glows
and
at
his
feet
the
starts
the
leafy
leash
that
holds
his
hounds
is
loosed
and
all
the
noonday
hush
is
startled
and
the
hillside
sounds
behind
the
fox
bounding
brush
when
red
dusk
makes
the
western
sky
a
window
through
the
firs
he
stoops
to
see
the
die
among
the
chestnut
broken
burs
then
fanfaree
and
fanfaree
down
vistas
of
the
afterglow
his
bugle
rings
from
tree
to
tree
while
all
the
world
grows
hushed
below
iii
like
some
black
host
the
shadows
fall
and
darkness
camps
among
the
trees
each
wildwood
road
a
goblin
hall
grows
populous
with
mysteries
night
comes
with
brows
of
ragged
storm
and
limbs
of
writhen
cloud
and
mist
the
hangs
upon
her
arm
like
some
wild
girl
that
will
be
kissed
by
her
gaunt
hand
the
leaves
are
shed
like
nightmares
an
enchantress
herds
and
like
a
witch
who
calls
the
dead
the
whirls
with
foaming
words
then
all
is
sudden
silence
and
dark
fear
like
his
who
can
not
see
yet
hears
aye
in
a
haunted
land
death
rattling
on
a
gallow
tree
iv
the
days
approach
again
the
days
whose
mantles
stream
whose
sandals
drag
when
in
the
haze
by
puddled
ways
each
gnarled
thorn
seems
a
crook√©d
hag
when
rotting
orchards
reek
with
rain
and
woodlands
crumble
leaf
and
log
and
in
the
drizzling
yard
again
the
gourd
is
tagged
with
points
of
fog
oh
let
me
seat
my
soul
among
your
melancholy
moods
and
touch
your
thoughts
sweet
sorrow
without
tongue
whose
silence
says
too
much
too
much
october
long
hosts
of
sunlight
and
the
bright
wind

the
splendor

royal
rose
and
duchess
daffodil
crowned
queen
of
beauty

strong
daughter
of
a
bitter
race

bold
a
ragged
beggar

a
lovely

the
sad
marigold

i
have
sought
june
butterfly
for
days
to
find
it
like
a
coreopsis
bloom
amber
and
seal
the
blaze
of
this
sunflower
plume
here
basks
the
bee
and
there
wings
dare
god
blue
gulfs
of

the

me
as
adieu
still
rings
upon
yon
prong

angry
sunset
brims
with
rosier
red

bowl
of
heaven
than
the
days
indeed
pour
in
each
blossom
of
this
where
each
leaf
seems
to
bleed
and
where
the
dance
a
tiny
mist
above
the
efforts
of
the
weedy
stream
the
girl
october
tired
of
the
tryst
dreams
a
diviner
dream
one
foot
just
dipping
the
caressing
wave
one
knee
at
languid
angle
locks
that
drown
hands
she
lies
and
grave
watching
the
leaves
drift
down
bare
boughs
o
heart
that
beat
the
bird
blithe
blood
the
blithe
bird
message
that
pursued
now
song
is
dead
as
last
year
bud
what
dost
thou
in
the
wood
o
soul
that
kept
the
brook
glad
flow
the
glad
brook
word
to
sun
and
moon
what
dost
thou
here
where
song
lies
low
as
all
the
dreams
of
june
where
once
was
heard
a
voice
of
song
the
hautboys
of
the
mad
winds
sing
where
once
a
music
flowed
along
the
rain
wild
bugles
ring
the
weedy
water
frets
and
ails
and
moans
in
many
a
sunless
fall
and
the
melancholy
trails
the
black
crow
eldritch
call
unhappy
brook
o
withered
wood
o
days
whom
death
makes
comrades
of
where
are
the
birds
that
thrilled
the
blood
when
life
struck
hands
with
love
a
song
one
soared
against
the
blue
a
song
one
bubbled
in
the
leaves
a
song
one
threw
where
orchards
grew
all
appled
to
the
eaves
but
now
the
birds
are
flown
or
dead
and
sky
and
earth
are
bleak
and
gray
the
wild
winds
sob
i
the
boughs
instead
the
wild
leaves
sigh
i
the
way
a
threnody
i
the
rainy
smell
of
a
ferny
dell
whose
shadow
no
sunray
flaws
when
autumn
sits
in
the
wayside
weeds
telling
her
beads
of
haws
ii
the
phantom
mist
that
is
on
hills
where
the
trees
are
thinned
when
autumn
leans
at
the
scarp
playing
a
harp
of
wind
iii
the
crickets
chirr
brier
and
burr
by
pools
and
streams
when
autumn
stands
the
dropping
nuts
with
the
book
she
shuts
of
dreams
iv
the
gray
alas
of
the
days
that
pass
and
the
hope
that
says
adieu
a
parting
sorrow
a
shriveled
flower
and
one
ghost
hour
with
you
snow
the
moon
like
a
round
device
on
a
shadowy
shield
of
war
hangs
white
in
a
heaven
of
ice
with
a
solitary
star
the
wind
is
sunk
to
a
sigh
and
the
waters
are
stern
with
frost
and
gray
in
the
eastern
sky
the
last
is
lost
white
fields
that
are
black
woods
that
are
cold
harsh
as
a
face
with
the
iron
of
some
black
thought
vagabonds
your
heart
with
april
and
mine
with
june
so
let
us
go
beneath
the
summer
moon
oh
was
it
in
the
sunlight
or
was
it
in
the
rain
we
met
among
the
blossoms
within
the
locust
lane
all
that
i
can
remember
the
bird
that
sang
aboon
and
with
its
music
in
our
hearts
we
rove
beneath
the
moon
a
of
the
wind
dear
of
which
we
read
the
rune
while
we
still
go
beneath
the
summer
moon
a
of
the
water
we
often
stop
to
hear
the
echoed
words
and
kisses
of
our
own
love
my
dear
and
all
our
path
shall
blossom
with
sweets
that
swoon
and
with
their
fragrance
in
our
hearts
we
rove
beneath
the
moon
it
will
not
be
forever
yet
merry
goes
the
tune
while
we
still
go
beneath
the
summer
moon
a
cabin
in
the
clearing
of
flickering
firelight
when
lanes
we
strolled
in
the
winter
snows
make
white
where
we
can
nod
together
above
the
logs
and
croon
the
songs
we
sang
when
roving
beneath
the
summer
moon
an
old
song
it
oh
for
the
hills
where
the
wind
some
one
with
a
vagabond
foot
that
follows
and
a
hand
that
he
claps
upon
your
arm
with
the
hearty
words
come
on
we
soon
be
out
of
the
hollows
my
heart
we
soon
be
out
of
the
hollows
it
oh
for
the
songs
where
the
hope
some
one
with
a
renegade
foot
that
doubles
and
a
kindly
look
that
he
turns
upon
your
face
with
the
friendly
laugh
come
on
we
soon
be
out
of
the
troubles
my
heart
we
soon
be
out
of
the
troubles
a
rose
o
the
hills
the
hills
look
down
on
wood
and
stream
on
and
farm
and
the
hills
the
of
heaven
bends
the
livelong
day
with
thoughts
of
calm
and
storm
on
wood
and
stream
the
hills
look
down
on
farm
and
and
the
hills
she
came
to
me
through
and
blackberry
the
hill
wind
hand
in
hand
the
hills
look
down
on
home
and
field
on
wood
and
winding
stream
and
the
hills
she
came
along
upon
her
lips
a
woodland
song
and
in
her
eyes
a
dream
on
home
and
field
the
hills
look
down
on
stream
and
vistaed
wood
and
with
disordered
hair
fair
in
the
wildrose
tangle
there
a
sudden
space
she
stood
o
hills
that
look
on
rock
and
road
on
grove
and
to
whom
god
giveth
rest
and
peace
and
slumber
that
is
kin
to
these
and
visions
unrevealed
o
hills
that
look
on
road
and
rock
on
field
and
fruited
grove
what
now
is
mine
of
peace
and
rest
in
you
since
entered
at
my
breast
god
sweet
unrest
of
love
dirge
what
shall
her
silence
keep
under
the
sun
here
where
the
willows
weep
and
waters
run
here
where
she
lies
asleep
and
all
is
done
lights
when
the
swings
scents
that
are
sown
sounds
of
the
wings
and
the
bee
drone
these
be
her
comfortings
under
the
stone
what
shall
watch
her
here
when
day
is
fled
here
when
the
night
is
near
and
skies
are
red
here
where
she
lieth
dear
and
young
and
dead
shadows
and
winds
that
spill
dew
and
the
tune
of
the
wild
whippoorwill
and
the
white
moon
these
be
the
watchers
still
over
her
stone
rest
under
the
brindled
beech
deep
in
the
mottled
shade
where
the
rocks
hang
in
reach
flower
and
ferny
blade
let
him
be
laid
here
will
the
brooks
that
rove
under
the
mossy
trees
grave
with
the
music
of
underworld
melodies
lap
him
in
peace
here
will
the
winds
that
blow
out
of
the
haunted
west
gold
with
the
dreams
that
glow
there
on
the
heaven
breast
lull
him
to
rest
here
will
the
stars
and
moon
silent
and
far
and
deep
old
with
the
mystic
rune
of
the
slow
years
that
creep
charm
him
with
sleep
under
the
ancient
beech
deep
in
the
mossy
shade
where
the
hill
moods
may
reach
where
the
hill
dreams
may
aid
let
him
be
laid
clairvoyance
the
sunlight
that
makes
of
the
heaven
a
pathway
for
sylphids
to
throng
the
wind
that
makes
harps
of
the
forests
for
spirits
to
smite
into
song
are
the
image
and
voice
of
a
vision
that
comforts
my
heart
and
makes
strong
i
look
in
one
face
and
the
shadows
are
lifted
and
lo
i
can
see
through
windows
of
evident
being
that
open
on
eternity
the
form
of
the
essence
of
beauty
god
clothes
with
his
own
mystery
i
lean
to
one
voice
and
the
wrangle
of
living
hath
pause
and
i
hear
through
doors
of
invisible
spirit
that
open
on
light
that
is
clear
the
radiant
raiment
of
music
in
the
hush
of
the
heavens
sweep
near
indifference
she
is
so
dear
the
wildflowers
near
each
path
she
passes
by
are
over
fain
to
kiss
again
her
feet
and
then
to
die
she
is
so
fair
the
wild
birds
there
that
sing
upon
the
bough
have
learned
the
staff
of
her
sweet
laugh
and
sing
no
other
now
alas
that
she
should
never
see
should
never
care
to
know
the
wildflower
love
the
bird
above
and
his
who
loves
her
so
pictured
this
is
the
face
of
her
i
dreamed
of
long
here
in
my
heart
despair
this
is
the
face
of
her
pictured
in
song
look
on
the
lily
lids
the
eyes
of
dawn
deep
as
a
nereid
swimming
with
dewy
lids
in
waters
wan
look
on
the
brows
of
snow
the
locks
only
young
sleep
can
show
such
brows
of
placid
snow
such
locks
of
night
the
cheeks
like
rosy
moons
the
lips
of
fire
love
thinks
no
sweeter
tunes
under
enchanted
moons
than
their
desire
loved
lips
and
eyes
and
hair
lo
this
is
she
she
who
sits
smiling
there
over
my
heart
despair
never
for
me
serenade
the
pink
rose
drops
its
petals
on
the
moonlit
lawn
the
moonlit
lawn
the
moon
like
some
wide
rose
of
white
drops
down
the
summer
night
no
rose
there
is
as
sweet
as
this
thy
mouth
that
greets
me
with
a
kiss
the
lattice
of
thy
casement

with

kissed

perfume

the

her
kiss
and
look

wind
o
happy
brook
have
blessed
you
unawares
at
the
rosy
hills
of
her
high
breasts
whereon
like
misty
morning
rests
the
breathing
lace
her
auburn
hair
wherein
a
star
point
sparkling
there
one
jewel
burns
her
eyes
that
keep
recorded
dreams
of
song
and
sleep
her
mouth

the
richest
rose
were
poor

whence

in

in

and

their
star
burn
deep
in
the
pansy
eve
hath
made
for
it
low
in
the
west
a
placid
purple
lit
at
its
far
edge
with
warm
auroral
light
love
planet
hangs
above
a
cedared
height
and
there
in
shadow
like
gold
music
writ
of
dusk
dark
fingers
flit
now
up
now
down
the
balmy
bars
of
night
how
different
from
that
eve
a
year
ago
which
was
a
stormy
flower
in
the
hair
of
dolorous
day
whose
sombre
eyes
looked
blurred
into
night
sibyl
face
and
saw
the
woe
of
parting
near
and
imaged
a
despair
as
now
a
hope
caught
from
a
homing
word
ii
she
came
unto
him
as
the
springtime
does
unto
the
land
where
all
lies
dead
and
cold
until
her
rosary
of
days
is
told
and
beauty
blossoms
where
death
nature
divined
her
coming
yea
the
dusk
seemed
thinking
of
that
happiness
behold
no
cloud
it
had
to
blot
its
marigold
moon
great
and
golden
the
slopes
of
musk
whereon
earth
voice
made
music
leaf
and
stream
lilting
the
same
low
lullaby
again
to
coax
the
wind
who
romped
among
the
hills
all
day
a
tired
child
to
sleep
and
dream
when
through
the
moonlight
of
the
she
came
as
spring
comes
through
her
daffodils
iii
white
as
a
lily
molded
of
earth
milk
that
eve
the
moon
swam
in
a
hyacinth
sky
soft
in
the
gleaming
glens
the
wind
went
by
faint
as
a
phantom
clothed
in
unseen
silk
bright
as
a
naiad
leap
from
shine
to
shade
the
runnel
twinkled
through
the
shaken
brier
above
the
hills
one
long
cloud
pulsed
with
fire
flashed
like
a
great
blade
and
when
the
western
sky
seemed
some
weird
land
and
night
a
witching
spell
at
whose
command
one
sloping
star
fell
green
from
and
deep
the
warm
rose
opened
for
the
moth
to
sleep
then
she
consenting
laid
her
hands
in
his
and
lifted
up
her
lips
for
their
first
kiss
iv
there
where
they
part
the
porch
step
is
strewn
with
petals
of
the
purple
vine
athwart
the
porch
the
shadow
of
a
pine
cleaves
the
white
moonlight
and
like
some
calm
rune
heaven
says
to
earth
shines
the
majestic
moon
and
now
a
meteor
draws
a
lilac
line
across
the
welkin
as
if
god
would
sign
the
perfect
poem
of
this
night
of
june
the
stirs
the
flowering
whose
curving
blossoms
strew
the
glimmering
grass
like
crescents
that
waters
glass
and
like
a
moonstone
in
a
frill
of
flame
the
trembles
on
the
peony
as
in
a
lover
heart
his
sweetheart
name
in
after
years
shall
she
stand
here
again
in
heart
regretful
and
with
lonely
sighs
think
on
that
night
of
love
and
realize
whose
was
the
fault
whence
grew
the
parting
pain
and
in
her
soul
persuading
still
in
vain
shall
doubt
take
shape
and
all
its
old
surmise
bid
darker
phantoms
of
remorse
arise
trailing
the
raiment
of
a
dead
disdain
masks
unto
whom
shall
her
avowal
yearn
with
looks
clairvoyant
seeing
how
each
is
a
different
form
with
eyes
and
lips
that
burn
into
her
heart
with
love
last
look
and
kiss
and
ere
they
pass
shall
she
behold
them
turn
to
her
a
face
which
evermore
is
his
vi
in
after
years
shall
he
remember
how
dawn
had
no
breeze
soft
as
her
murmured
name
and
day
no
sunlight
that
availed
the
same
as
her
bright
smile
to
cheer
the
world
below
nor
had
the
conscious
twilight
golds
and
grays
her
soul
allurement
that
was
free
of
blame
nor
dusk
gold
canvas
where
one
star
white
flame
shone
more
bewitchment
than
her
own
sweet
then
as
the
night
with
moonlight
and
perfume
and
dew
and
darkness
qualifies
the
whole
dim
world
with
glamour
shall
the
past
with
dreams
that
were
the
of
their
lives
illume
the
present
with
remembered
hours
whose
gleams
unknown
to
him
shall
face
them
soul
to
soul
vii
no
not
for
her
and
him
that
part
sad
consolation
where
had
bent
haply
in
prayer
and
patience
penitent
both
though
apart
before
no
light
the
otherwise
of
fate
for
them
when
white
the
lilacs
bloom
again
and
innocent
spring
comes
with
beauty
for
her
testament
singing
the
praises
of
the
day
and
night
when
orchards
blossom
and
the
distant
hill
is
vague
with
as
a
ridge
with
mist
the
moon
shall
see
him
where
a
watch
he
keeps
by
her
young
form
that
lieth
white
and
still
with
lidded
eyes
and
passive
wrist
on
wrist
while
by
her
side
he
bows
himself
and
weeps
viii
and
oh
what
pain
to
see
the
blooms
appear
of
haw
and
dogwood
in
the
spring
again
the
primrose
leaning
with
the
dragging
rain
and
orchards
swarming
far
and
near
to
see
the
old
fields
that
her
steps
made
dear
grow
green
with
deepening
plenty
of
the
grain
yet
feel
how
this
excess
of
life
is
vain
how
vain
to
him
since
she
no
more
is
here
what
though
the
woodland
burgeon
water
flow
like
a
rejoicing
harp
beneath
the
boughs
the
and
the
arouse
day
with
the
impulsive
music
of
their
love
beneath
the
graveyard
sod
she
will
not
know
nor
what
his
heart
is
all
too
conscious
of
ix
how
blessed
is
he
who
gazing
in
the
tomb
can
yet
behold
beneath
th
investing
mask
of
mockery
whose
horror
seems
to
ask
of
the
soul
within
the
gloom
upon
dead
lips
no
dust
of
love
dead
bloom
and
in
dead
hands
no
shards
of
faith
rent
flask
but
hope
who
still
stands
at
her
starry
task
weaving
the
web
of
comfort
on
her
loom
thrice
blessed
who
he
hear
the
tomb
proclaim
how
all
is
death
and
life
death
other
name
can
yet
reply
o
grave
these
things
are
yours
but
that
is
left
which
life
indeed
assures
love
through
whose
touch
i
shall
arise
the
same
love
of
whose
self
was
wrought
the
universe
a
reed
shaken
with
the
wind
i
not
for
you
and
me
the
path
winding
through
the
shadowless
fields
of
morning
dewiness
where
the
brook
that
hurries
hath
laughter
lighter
than
a
boy
where
recurrent
odors
poise
with
irreverent
tresses
in
the
sun
and
birds
and
boughs
build
a
house
for
the
winds
to
hang
their
dresses
rustling
in
ours
a
path
that
led
unto
twilight
regions
gray
with
dew
where
gathered
thin
over
acres
sisterless
of
all
healthy
beauty
where
fungus
growths
made
sad
the
air
with
a
caress
under
darkness
and
strange
stars
to
the
bars
of
a
dubious
forestland
where
the
seemed
to
stand
and
the
sounds
on
either
hand
clad
like
sleep
own
servitors
in
the
shadowy
livery
of
the
ancient
house
of
dreams
that
before
us
fitfully
with
white
intermittent
gleams
of
its
windows
shone
echoing
with
the
dim
unknown
ii
to
say
to
hope
take
all
from
me
and
grant
me
naught
the
rose
the
song
the
melody
the
word
the
thought
then
all
my
life
bid
me
be
slave
is
all
i
crave
to
say
to
time
be
true
to
me
nor
grant
me
less
the
dream
the
sigh
the
memory
the
heart
distress
then
unto
death
set
me
a
task
is
all
i
ask
iii
i
came
to
you
when
eve
was
young
and
where
the
park
went
downward
to
the
river
and
among
the
dew
one
vesper
moment
lit
and
sung
a
bird
your
eyes
said
something
dear
how
sweet
it
was
to
walk
with
you
how
with
our
souls
we
seemed
to
hear
the
darkness
coming
with
its
stars
how
calm
the
moon
sloped
up
her
sphere
of
pearl
through
passive
bars
of
clouds
that
berged
the
tender
east
while
all
the
dark
inanimate
of
nature
woke
initiate
with
th
moon
arrival
something
ceased
in
nature
soul
she
stood
again
another
self
that
seemed
t
have
been
dormant
suppressed
and
so
unseen
all
day
a
life
unknown
and
strange
and
that
had
lain
masked
on
with
light
within
the
range
of
thought
but
unrevealed
till
now
it
was
the
hour
of
love
and
you
with
downward
eyes
and
pensive
brow
among
the
moonlight
and
the
dew
although
no
word
of
love
was
spoken
heard
the
sweet
night
confession
broken
of
something
here
that
spoke
in
me
a
love
depth
made
inaudible
save
to
your
soul
that
answered
well
with
eyes
replying
silently
iv
fair
you
are
as
a
rose
is
fair
there
where
the
shadows
dew
it
and
the
deeps
of
your
brown
brown
hair
sweet
as
the
cloud
that
lingers
there
with
the
sunset
auburn
through
it
eyes
of
azure
and
throat
of
snow
tell
me
what
my
heart
would
know
every
dream
i
dream
of
you
has
a
in
it
and
a
hope
a
kiss
or
two
something
dear
and
something
true
telling
me
each
minute
with
three
words
it
whispers
clear
what
my
heart
from
you
would
hear
summer
came
the
days
grew
kind
with
increasing
favors
deep
were
the
nights
with
rest
and
sleep
fair
with
poppies
intertwined
on
their
blonde
locks
dreamy
hours
as
the
rose
went
among
the
banded
flowers
teaching
them
how
no
one
knows
fresher
color
and
in
the
window
of
your
room
bloomed
a
rich
azalea
pink
as
an
egret
rosy
plumes
shone
its
blooms
from
your
care
and
love
i
think
love
it
did
drink
growing
rosier
day
by
day
of
your
hand
caress
and
your
own
dear
naturalness
had
imbued
it
in
some
way
once
you
gave
a
blossom
of
it
smiling
to
me
when
i
left
need
i
tell
you
how
i
love
it
faded
though
it
is
now
reft
of
its
fragrance
and
its
color
yet
is
dearer
now
than
then
as
past
happiness
is
when
we
regret
and
dimmer
duller
though
its
beauty
be
when
i
look
upon
it
i
recall
every
part
of
that
old
wall
and
the
dingy
window
high
where
you
sat
and
read
and
all
the
fond
love
that
made
your
face
a
soft
sunbeam
in
that
place
and
the
plant
that
grew
this
bloom
withered
here
itself
long
dead
makes
a
halo
overhead
there
again
and
through
my
room
like
faint
whispers
of
perfume
steal
the
words
of
love
then
said
vi
all
of
my
love
i
send
to
you
i
send
to
you
on
thoughts
like
paths
that
wend
to
you
here
in
my
heart
glad
garden
wherein
its
lovely
warden
your
face
a
lily
seeming
is
dreaming
all
of
my
life
i
bring
to
you
i
bring
to
you
in
deeds
like
birds
that
sing
to
you
here
in
my
soul
sweet
valley
wherethrough
most
musically
your
love
a
fountain
glistens
and
listens
my
love
my
life
how
blessed
in
you
how
blessed
in
you
whose
thoughts
whose
deeds
find
rest
in
you
here
on
my
self
dark
ocean
in
heavenly
motion
your
soul
a
star
abideth
and
guideth
vii
where
the
old
kentucky
wound
through
the
land
its
stream
between
hills
of
primitive
forest
green
like
a
goodly
belt
around
giant
breasts
of
grandeur
with
many
an
unknown
indian
myth
on
the
boat
we
steamed
the
land
like
an
hospitable
hand
welcomed
us
alone
we
sat
on
the
and
saw
and
plantation
draw
near
and
vanish
your
hat
your
young
eyes
laughed
and
your
hair
blown
about
them
by
the
air
of
our
passage
clung
and
curled
music
and
the
summer
moon
and
the
hills
great
shadows
hewn
out
of
silence
and
the
tune
of
the
whistle
when
we
whirled
round
a
moonlit
bend
in
sight
of
some
lone
landing
heaped
with
hay
or
tobacco
where
the
light
of
one
dim
solitary
lamp
signaled
through
the
evening
damp
then
a
bell
and
dusky
gray
shuffling
figures
on
the
shore
with
the
cable
rugged
forms
on
the
backs
and
arms
with
their
cargo
bending
and
the
burly
mate
before
then
an
iron
bell
and
puff
of
escaping
steam
and
out
where
the
stream
is
rough
music
and
a
parting
shout
from
the
shore
the
pilot
bell
beating
on
the
deck
below
then
the
steady
quivering
slow
smooth
advance
again
until
twinkling
lights
beyond
us
tell
there
a
lock
or
little
town
clasped
between
a
hill
and
hill
where
the
fields
slope
so
we
went
that
lingers
with
me
like
a
rhyme
learned
for
dreamy
beauty
of
its
faith
and
love
in
some
musing
moment
sith
with
joy
that
moment
quiet
bore
thought
repeated
evermore
viii
three
sweet
things
love
lives
upon
music
at
whose
fountain
brink
still
he
stoops
his
face
to
drink
seeing
as
the
wave
is
drawn
his
own
image
rise
and
sink
three
sweet
things
love
lives
upon
three
sweet
things
love
lives
upon
odor
whose
red
roses
wreathe
his
bright
brow
that
shines
beneath

as
each
bud
is
blown
his
own
spirit
breathe
and
breathe
three
sweet
things

lives
upon
three
sweet
things
love
lives
upon
color
to
whose
rainbow
he
lifts
his
dark
eyes
burningly
feeling
as
the
wild
hues
dawn
his
own
immortality
three
sweet
things

lives
upon
ix
memories
of
other
days
with
the
whilom
happiness
rise
before
my
musing
gaze
in
the
twilight
and
your
dress
seems
beside
me
like
a
haze
shimmering
white
as
when
we
went
the
firmament
with
impatient
feet
down
the
night
that
sparkled
the
street
every
look
love
gave
us
then
comes
before
my
eyes
again
making
music
for
my
heart
on
that
path
that
grew
for
us
roses
red
and
amorous
on
that
path
from
which
oft
start
out
of
recollected
places
with
remembered
forms
and
faces
dreams
love
ardent
hands
have
woven
in
my
life
dark
tapestry
beckoning
soft
and
shadowy
to
the
soul
and
the
cloven
gulf
of
time
i
seem
to
hear
words
once
whispered
in
the
ear
calling
as
might
friends
long
dead
with
familiar
voices
deep
speak
to
those
who
lie
asleep
comforting
so
i
was
led
backward
to
forgotten
things
contiguities
that
spread
sudden
unremembered
wings
and
across
my
mind
still
blue
from
the
nest
they
fledged
in
flew
dazzling
shapes
affection
knew
ah
over
full
my
heart
is
of
sadness
and
of
pain
as
a
in
the
garden
the
dull
dusk
fills
with
rain
as
a
blown
red
rose
that
shivers
and
bends
to
the
wind
and
rain
so
give
me
thy
hands
and
speak
me
as
once
in
the
days
of
yore
when
love
spoke
sweetly
to
us
the
love
that
speaks
no
more
the
sound
of
thy
voice
may
help
him
to
speak
in
our
hearts
once
more
ah
over
grieved
my
soul
is
and
tired
and
sick
for
sleep
as
a
that
withers
forgotten
where
reapers
reap
as
a
harvested
that
dies
where
reapers
reap
so
bend
to
my
face
and
kiss
me
as
once
in
the
days
of
yore
when
the
touch
of
thy
lips
was
magic
that
restored
to
life
once
more
the
thought
of
thy
kiss
which
awakens
to
life
that
love
once
more
xi
sitting
often
i
have
oh
often
have
desired
you
so
yearned
to
kiss
you
as
i
did
when
your
love
to
me
you
gave
in
the
moonlight
by
the
wave
and
a
long
impetuous
kiss
pressed
upon
your
mouth
that
chid
and
upon
each
dewy
lid
that
all
i
with
love
language
will
address
each
dear
thing
i
know
you
by
picture
or
frame
each
suggestive
in
the
same
perfume
of
past
happiness
till
meseems
the
ways
we
knew
now
again
i
tread
with
you
from
the
oldtime
tryst
and
there
feel
the
pressure
of
your
hair
cool
and
easy
on
my
cheek
and
your
breath
aroma
bare
hand
upon
my
arm
as
weak
as
a
lily
on
a
stream
and
your
eyes
that
gaze
at
me
with
the
sometime
witchery
to
my
inmost
spirit
speak
and
remembered
ecstacy
sweeps
my
soul
again
i
seem
dreaming
yet
i
do
not
dream
xii
when
day
dies
lone
forsaken
and
joy
is
kissed
asleep
when
doubt
gray
eyes
awaken
and
love
with
music
taken
from
hearts
with
sighings
shaken
sits
in
the
dusk
to
weep
with
ghostly
lifted
finger
what
memory
then
shall
rise
of
dark
regret
the
bringer
to
tell
the
sorrowing
singer
of
days
whose
echoes
linger
till
dawn
unstars
the
skies
when
night
is
gone
and
beaming
faith
journeys
forth
to
toil
when
hope
blue
eyes
wake
gleaming
and
life
is
done
with
dreaming
the
dreams
that
seem
but
seeming
within
the
world
turmoil
can
we
forget
the
presence
of
death
who
walks
unseen
whose
scythe
casts
shadowy
crescents
around
life
glittering
essence
as
lessens
slowly
lessens
the
space
that
lies
between
xiii
bland
was
that
october
day
calm
and
balmy
as
the
spring
when
we
went
a
paternal
beeches
gray
to
a
valleyed
opening
where
the
purple
aster
flowered
and
like
torches
red
the
fiery
sumach
towered
and
where
sentineled
vistas
robed
in
gold
and
garnet
ripe
the
thorny
chestnut
shelled
its
brown
plumpness
bee
and
hornet
droned
around
us
quick
the
cricket
tireless
in
the
thicket
tremoloed
and
to
the
wind
all
its
silver
casting
swung
the
pod
unthinned
and
its
clean
flame
on
the
sod
by
the
fading
burned
the
white
it
was
not
so
much
the
time
nor
the
place
nor
way
we
went
that
made
all
our
moods
to
rhyme
nor
the
season
sentiment
as
it
was
the
innocent
carefree
childhood
of
our
hearts
reading
each
expression
of
death
and
care
as
life
and
love
that
impression
joy
imparts
unto
others
and
retorts
on
itself
which
then
made
glad
all
the
sorrow
of
decay
as
the
memory
of
that
day
makes
this
day
of
spring
now
sad
xiv
the
petunias
hang
riven
of
the
rain
and
where
the
was
now
droops
a
tawny
stain
while
in
the
twilight
purple
pause
earth
dreams
of
heaven
again
when
one
shall
sit
and
sigh
and
one
lie
all
alone
beneath
the
unseen
sky
whose
love
shall
then
deny
whose
love
atone
with
ragged
petals
round
its
pod
the
poppy
dies
and
where
the
hectic
rose
did
nod
a
crumbled
crimson
lies
while
distant
as
the
dreams
of
god
the
stars
slip
in
the
skies
when
one
shall
lie
asleep
and
one
be
dead
and
gone
within
the
unknown
deep
shall
we
the
trysts
then
keep
that
now
are
done
xv
holding
both
your
hands
in
mine
often
have
we
sat
together
while
outside
the
boisterous
weather
hung
the
wild
wind
on
the
pine
like
a
black
marauder
and
with
a
sudden
warning
hand
at
the
casement
rapped
the
night
read
no
sentiment
of
light
within
her
romance
of
death
and
sin
looking
in
your
eyes
ah
me
though
i
heard
i
did
not
heed
what
the
night
read
unto
us
threatening
and
ominous
for
love
helped
my
heart
to
read
forward
through
unopened
pages
to
a
coming
day
that
held
more
for
us
than
all
the
ages
past
that
it
epitomized
in
its
sentence
where
we
spelled
what
our
present
realized
only
all
the
love
that
was
past
and
yet
to
be
for
us
xvi
in
the
garden
gray
with
dew
all
life
lies
withering
and
there
no
more
to
say
or
do
no
more
to
sigh
or
sing
yet
go
we
back
the
ways
we
knew
when
buds
were
opening
perhaps
we
shall
not
search
in
vain
within
its
wreck
and
gloom
roses
ruined
of
the
rain
there
still
may
live
one
bloom
one
flower
whose
heart
may
still
retain
the
and
then
perhaps
will
come
to
us
the
dreams
we
dreamed
before
and
song
who
spoke
so
beauteous
will
speak
to
us
once
more
and
love
with
eyes
all
amorous
will
ope
again
his
door
so
the
garden
gray
with
dew
and
flowers
are
withering
and
there
no
more
to
say
or
do
no
more
to
sigh
or
sing
yet
go
we
back
the
ways
we
knew
when
buds
were
opening
xvii
looking
on
the
desolate
street
where
the
march
snow
drifts
and
drives
trodden
black
of
hurrying
feet
where
the
athlete
strives
with
each
tree
and
dangling
light
centers
sphered
with
glittering
white
hissing
in
the
dancing
snow
backward
in
my
soul
i
go
to
that
night
of
two
autumns
past
when
we
hastening
homeward
were
of
the
storm
and
a
tree
with
its
wild
leaves
sheltered
us
in
that
forsaken
sad
and
ancient
cemetery
where
folk
came
no
more
to
haggard
mossed
and
crumbled
tottered
us
or
in
their
sunken
graves
and
some
urned
and
obelisked
above
in
tombs
stood
dumb
records
of
forgotten
love
and
again
i
see
the
west
yawning
inward
to
its
core
of
ore
swiftly
without
pause
or
rest
and
a
great
wind
sweeps
the
dust
up
abandoned
sidewalks
and
in
the
rotting
trees
the
gust
shouts
again
a
voice
that
would
make
its
gaunt
self
understood
moaning
over
death
lean
land
and
we
sat
there
hand
in
hand
on
the
granite
where
we
read
by
the
leaping
skies
something
of
one
young
and
dead
yet
the
words
begot
no
fear
in
our
souls
you
leaned
your
cheek
smiling
on
mine
very
near
were
our
lips
we
did
not
speak
xviii
and
suddenly
alone
i
stood
with
scared
eyes
gazing
through
the
wood
for
some
still
sign
of
ill
or
good
to
lead
me
from
the
solitude
the
day
was
at
its
twilighting
one
cloud
spread
a
vast
wing
of
rosy
thunder
vanishing
above
the
far
hills
mystic
ring
some
stars
shone
timidly
and
toward
the
west
cadaverous
red
like
some
wild
dream
that
haunts
the
dead
in
limbo
the
lean
moon
was
led
upon
the
sad
debatable
vague
lands
of
twilight
slowly
fell
a
silence
that
i
knew
too
well
a
sorrow
that
i
can
not
tell
what
way
to
take
what
path
to
go
whether
into
the
east
gray
glow
or
where
the
west
burnt
red
and
low
what
road
to
choose
i
did
not
know
so
hesitating
there
i
stood
lost
in
my
soul
uncertain
wood
one
sign
i
craved
of
ill
or
good
to
lead
me
from
its
solitude
xix
it
was
autumn
and
a
night
full
of
whispers
and
of
mist
with
a
gray
moon
wanly
whist
hanging
like
a
phantom
light
the
hills
we
stood
among
windy
fields
of
weed
and
flower
where
the
withered
seed
pod
hung
and
the
chill
sung
melancholy
was
the
hour
with
the
mystery
and
loneness
of
the
year
that
seemed
to
look
on
its
own
departed
face
as
our
love
then
in
its
oneness
all
its
dead
past
did
retrace
and
from
that
sad
moment
took
presage
of
approaching
sorrowful
the
hour
and
dark
low
among
the
trees
now
starting
now
concealed
a
star
pale
spark
like
a
winked
and
lured
on
to
shuddering
shadows
where
all
was
doubtful
unassured
immaterial
and
the
bare
facts
of
unideal
day
changed
to
substance
such
as
dreams
and
meseemed
then
far
away
farther
than
remotest
gleams
of
the
stars
lost
separated
and
estranged
and
out
of
reach
grew
our
lives
away
from
each
loving
lives
that
long
had
waited
xx
there
is
no
gladness
in
the
day
now
you
away
dull
is
the
morn
the
noon
is
dull
once
beautiful
and
when
the
evening
fills
the
skies
with
dusky
dyes
with
tired
eyes
and
tired
heart
i
sit
alone
i
sigh
apart
and
wish
for
you
ah
darker
now
the
night
comes
on
since
you
are
gone
sad
are
the
stars
the
moon
is
sad
once
wholly
glad
and
when
the
stars
and
moon
are
set
and
earth
lies
wet
with
heart
regret
and
soul
hard
ache
i
dream
alone
i
lie
awake
and
wish
for
you
these
who
once
spake
me
speak
no
more
now
all
is
day
hath
forgot
the
language
of
its
hopes
of
love
night
whose
sweet
lips
were
burdensome
with
dreams
is
dumb
far
different
from
what
used
to
be
with
silence
and
despondency
they
speak
to
me
xxi
so
it
ends
the
path
that
crept
through
a
land
all
where
the
sickly
moonlight
slept
like
a
pale
antagonist
now
the
star
that
led
us
onward
reassuring
with
its
light
fails
and
falters
dipping
downward
leaves
us
wandering
in
night
with
old
doubts
we
once
disdained
so
it
ends
the
woods
attained
where
our
heart
desire
builded
a
fair
temple
with
hope
marble
shrine
within
where
the
lineaments
of
our
love
shone
with
lilies
clad
and
crowned
white
columns
reared
above
sorrow
and
her
sister
sin
columns
rose
and
in
the
forest
we
have
found
but
a
ruin
all
around
lie
the
shattered
capitals
and
vast
fragments
of
the
walls
like
a
climbing
cloud
that
plies
the
moon
that
lies
its
blackness
taking
on
gradual
certainties
of
wan
soft
assaults
of
easy
white
till
the
emptiness
and
hungry
night
claim
its
bulk
again
while
she
rides
in
lonely
purity
so
we
found
our
temple
broken
and
a
musing
moment
space
love
whose
latest
word
was
spoken
seemed
to
meet
us
face
to
face
making
bright
that
ruined
place
with
a
strange
effulgence
then
passed
and
left
all
black
again
a
flower
of
the
fields
in
the
orchard
hung
the
peach
or
fallen
in
the
weeds
lay
rotting
where
still
sucked
and
sung
the
gray
bee
boring
to
its
pink
pulp
and
honey
blackly
stung
the
orchard
path
which
led
around
the
garden
with
its
heat
one
twinge
of
dinning
locusts
and
ragged
brought
me
where
one
hinge
held
up
the
gate
that
scraped
the
ground
all
seemed
the
same
the
with
pigmy
balconies
still
stood
with
all
its
twittering
flocks
perched
on
its
pole
above
the
peas
and
the
and
the
rose
the
clump
of
coppery
sunflowers
with
the
heat
sick
to
the
heart
the
garden
stump
red
with
and
sweet
with
moss
and
ferns
this
side
the
pump
i
rested
with
one
hesitant
hand
upon
the
gate
the
lonesome
day
droning
with
insects
made
the
land
one
dry
stagnation
soaked
with
hay
and
scents
of
weeds
the
hot
wind
fanned
i
breathed
the
sultry
scents
my
eyes
parched
as
my
lips
and
yet
i
felt
my
limbs
were
ice
as
one
who
flies
to
some
strange
woe
how
sleepy
smelt
the
heat
that
soaked
the
skies
noon
nodded
dreamier
lonesomer
for
one
long
plaintive
forestside
and
i
knew
me
near
some
heartbreak
anguish
she
had
died
i
felt
it
and
no
need
to
hear
i
passed
the
quince
and
peartree
where
all
up
the
porch
a
trails
how
strange
that
fruit
whatever
air
or
earth
it
grows
in
never
fails
to
find
its
native
flavor
there
and
she
was
as
a
flower
too
that
grows
its
proper
bloom
and
scent
no
matter
what
the
soil
she
who
born
better
than
her
place
still
lent
grace
to
the
lowliness
she
knew
they
met
me
at
the
porch
and
were
with
weeping
then
the
room
shut
out
the
country
heat
and
purr
and
left
light
stricken
into
gloom
so
love
and
i
might
look
on
her
the
white
vigil
last
night
i
dreamed
i
saw
you
lying
dead
and
by
your
sheeted
form
stood
all
alone
frail
as
a
you
lay
upon
your
bed
and
on
your
still
face
through
the
casement
shone
the
moon
as
lingering
to
kiss
you
there
asleep
white
violets
in
your
hair
oh
sick
to
weeping
was
my
soul
and
sad
to
breaking
was
my
heart
that
would
not
break
and
for
my
soul
great
grief
no
tear
i
had
no
lamentation
for
my
heart
deep
ache
yet
all
i
bore
seemed
more
than
i
could
bear
beside
you
dead
white
violets
in
your
hair
a
white
rose
blooming
at
your
and
glimmering
in
it
like
a
caught
upon
the
thorns
the
light
of
one
white
star
looked
on
with
me
as
if
they
felt
and
thought
as
did
my
heart
how
beautiful
and
fair
and
young
she
lies
white
violets
in
her
hair
and
so
we
watched
beside
you
sad
and
still
the
star
the
rose
and
i
the
moon
had
past
like
a
pale
traveler
behind
the
hill
with
all
her
echoed
radiance
at
last
the
darkness
came
to
hide
my
tears
and
share
my
watch
by
you
white
violets
in
your
hair
too
late
i
looked
upon
a
dead
girl
face
and
heard
what
seemed
the
voice
of
love
call
unto
me
out
of
her
heart
whereon
the
charactery
of
her
lost
dreams
i
read
there
word
for
word
how
on
her
soul
no
soul
had
touched
or
stirred
her
life
sad
depths
to
rippling
melody
or
made
the
imaged
longing
there
to
be
the
realization
of
a
hope
deferred
so
in
her
life
had
love
behaved
to
her
between
the
lonely
chapters
of
her
years
and
her
young
eyes
making
no
golden
blur
with
face
and
hair
who
led
me
to
her
side
at
last
and
bade
me
through
my
tears
with
death
dumb
face
too
late
to
see
and
know
intimations
i
is
it
uneasy
moonlight
on
the
restless
field
that
stirs
or
wild
white
the
bends
and
blurs
is
it
the
dolorous
water
that
sobs
in
the
wood
and
sighs
or
heart
of
an
ancient
that
breaks
and
sighing
dies
the
wind
is
vague
with
the
shadows
that
wander
in
land
the
water
is
dark
with
the
voices
that
weep
on
the
unknown
strand
o
ghosts
of
the
winds
who
call
me
o
ghosts
of
the
whispering
waves
as
sad
as
forgotten
flowers
that
die
upon
nameless
graves
what
is
this
thing
you
tell
me
in
tongues
of
a
twilight
race
of
death
with
the
vanished
features
mantled
of
my
own
face
ii
the
old
enigmas
of
the
deathless
dawns
and
riddles
of
the
all
immortal
eves
that
still
delphic
lawns
speak
as
the
gods
spoke
through
oracular
leaves
i
read
with
eyes
remembering
how
a
slave
i
lay
with
breast
bared
for
the
sacrifice
once
on
a
temple
pave
or
crowned
with
hyacinth
and
helichrys
how
towards
the
altar
in
the
marble
gloom
hearing
the
magadis
dirge
through
the
pale
amaracine
perfume
chanting
priests
i
trod
with
never
a
sigh
or
pause
to
give
my
life
to
pacify
a
god
and
save
my
country
cause
again
cyrenian
roses
on
wild
hair
and
oil
and
purple
smeared
on
breasts
and
cheeks
how
with
mad
torches
there
reddening
the
cedars
of
cith√¶ron
peaks
with
gesture
and
fierce
glance
lascivious
m√¶nad
bands
once
drew
and
slew
me
in
the
pyrrhic
dance
with
bacchanalian
hands
iii
the
music
now
that
lays
dim
lips
against
my
ears
some
wild
sad
thing
it
says
unto
my
soul
of
years
long
passed
into
the
haze
of
tears
meseems
before
me
are
the
dark
eyes
of
a
queen
a
queen
of
istakhar
i
seem
to
see
her
lean
more
lovely
than
a
star
of
mien
a
slave
i
stand
before
her
jeweled
throne
i
kneel
and
in
a
song
once
more
my
love
for
her
reveal
how
once
i
did
adore
i
feel
again
her
dark
eyes
gleam
again
her
red
lips
smile
and
in
her
face
the
beam
of
love
that
knows
no
guile
and
so
she
seems
to
dream
a
while
out
of
her
deep
hair
then
a
rose
she
takes
and
i
am
made
a
god
men
her
rose
that
here
did
lie
when
i
in
th
den
did
die
iv
old
paintings
on
its
wainscots
and
in
its
oaken
hall
old
arras
and
the
twilight
of
slumber
over
all
old
grandeur
on
its
stairways
and
in
its
haunted
rooms
old
souvenirs
of
greatness
and
ghosts
of
dead
perfumes
the
winds
are
phantom
voices
around
its
carven
doors
the
moonbeams
specter
footsteps
upon
its
polished
floors
old
cedars
build
around
it
a
solitude
of
sighs
and
the
old
hours
pass
through
it
with
immemorial
eyes
but
more
than
this
i
know
not
nor
where
the
house
may
be
nor
what
its
ancient
secret
and
ancient
grief
to
me
all
that
my
soul
remembers
is
that
forgot
almost
once
in
a
former
lifetime
was
here
i
loved
and
lost
in
e√∂ns
of
the
senses
my
spirit
knew
of
yore
i
found
the
isle
of
circe
and
felt
her
magic
lore
and
still
the
soul
remembers
what
flesh
would
be
once
more
she
gave
me
flowers
to
smell
of
that
wizard
branches
bore
of
weird
and
sorcerous
beauty
whose
stems
dripped
human
gore
their
scent
when
i
remember
i
know
that
world
once
more
she
gave
me
fruits
to
eat
of
that
grew
beside
the
shore
of
necromantic
ripeness
with
human
flesh
at
core
their
taste
when
i
remember
i
know
that
life
once
more
and
then
behold
a
serpent
that
glides
my
face
before
with
eyes
of
tears
and
fire
that
glare
me
and
i
look
into
its
eyeballs
and
know
myself
once
more
vi
i
have
looked
in
the
eyes
of
poesy
and
sat
in
song
high
place
and
the
beautiful
spirits
of
music
have
spoken
me
face
to
face
yet
here
in
my
soul
there
is
sorrow
they
never
can
name
nor
trace
i
have
walked
with
the
glamour
gladness
and
dreamed
with
the
shadow
sleep
and
the
presences
love
and
knowledge
have
smiled
in
my
heart
red
keep
yet
here
in
my
soul
there
is
sorrow
for
the
depth
of
their
gaze
too
deep
the
love
and
the
hope
god
grants
me
the
beauty
that
lures
me
on
and
the
dreams
of
folly
and
wisdom
that
thoughts
of
the
spirit
don
are
but
masks
of
an
ancient
sorrow
of
a
life
long
dead
and
gone
was
it
sin
or
a
crime
forgotten
of
a
love
that
loved
too
well
that
sat
on
a
throne
of
fire
a
thousand
years
in
hell
that
the
soul
with
its
nameless
sorrow
remembers
but
can
not
tell
two
with
her
soft
face
half
turned
to
me
like
an
arrested
moonbeam
she
stood
in
the
cirque
of
that
deep
tree
i
took
her
by
the
hands
she
raised
her
face
to
mine
and
half
amazed
remembered
and
we
stood
and
gazed
how
good
to
kiss
her
throat
and
hair
and
say
no
word
her
throat
was
bare
as
some
white
and
fair
had
god
not
us
life
for
this
the
amorous
happiness
of
arms
that
clasp
and
lips
that
kiss
the
eloquence
of
limbs
and
arms
the
rhetoric
of
breasts
whose
charms
say
to
the
sluggish
blood
what
warms
had
god
or
fiend
assigned
this
hour
that
bloomed
where
love
had
all
of
power
the
senses
aphrodisiac
flower
the
dawn
was
far
away
nude
night
hung
savage
stars
of
sultry
white
around
her
bosom
ethiop
light
night
night
who
gave
us
each
to
each
where
heart
with
heart
could
hold
sweet
speech
with
life
best
gift
within
our
reach
and
here
it
was
between
the
goals
of
flesh
and
spirit
sex
controls
took
place
the
marriage
of
our
souls
tones
i
a
woman
fair
to
look
upon
where
waters
whiten
with
the
moon
while
down
the
glimmer
of
the
lawn
the
white
moths
swoon
a
mouth
of
music
eyes
of
love
and
hands
of
blended
snow
and
scent
that
touch
the
shadow
of
an
instrument
and
low
and
sweet
that
song
of
sleep
after
the
song
of
love
is
hushed
while
all
the
longing
here
to
weep
is
held
and
crushed
then
leafy
silence
that
is
musk
with
breath
of
the
while
dwindles
through
the
dusk
her
drapery
let
me
remember
how
a
heart
romantic
wrote
upon
that
night
my
soul
still
helps
me
read
each
part
of
it
aright
and
like
a
dead
leaf
shut
between
a
book
dull
chapters
stained
and
dark
that
page
with
immemorial
green
of
life
i
mark
ii
it
is
not
well
for
me
to
hear
that
song
appealing
melody
the
pain
of
loss
comes
all
too
near
through
it
to
me
the
loss
of
her
whose
love
looks
through
the
mist
death
hand
hath
hung
between
within
the
shadow
of
the
yew
her
grave
is
green
ah
dream
that
vanished
long
ago
oh
anguish
of
remembered
tears
and
shadow
of
unlifted
woe
athwart
the
years
that
haunt
the
sad
rooms
of
my
days
as
keepsakes
of
unperished
love
where
pale
the
memory
of
her
face
is
framed
above
this
olden
song
she
used
to
sing
of
love
and
sleep
is
now
a
charm
to
open
mystic
doors
and
bring
her
spirit
form
in
music
making
visible
one
memory
that
steals
unto
my
side
to
tell
my
loss
to
me
unfulfilled
in
my
dream
last
night
it
seemed
i
stood
with
a
boy
glad
heart
in
my
boyhood
wood
the
beryl
green
and
the
cairngorm
brown
of
the
day
through
the
deep
leaves
sifted
down
the
rippling
drip
of
a
passing
shower
rinsed
wild
aroma
from
herb
and
flower
the
splash
and
urge
of
a
waterfall
spread
stairwayed
rocks
with
a
crystal
caul
and
i
waded
the
pool
where
the
gravel
gray
and
the
last
year
leaf
like
a
topaz
lay
and
searched
the
strip
of
the
creek
dry
bed
for
the
colored
keel
and
the
and
i
found
the
cohosh
coigne
the
same
tossing
with
torches
of
pearly
flame
the
owlet
dingle
of
vine
and
brier
that
the
flecked
fierce
with
fire
the
elder
edge
with
its
warm
perfume
and
the
sapphire
stars
of
the
bluet
bloom
the
moss
the
fern
and
the
i
breathed
and
the
keen
and
hot
and
i
saw
the
bird
that
sang
its
best
in
the
moted
sunlight
building
its
nest
and
i
saw
the
chipmunk
stealthy
face
and
the
rabbit
crouched
in
a
grassy
place
and
i
watched
the
crows
that
cawed
and
cried
hunting
the
hawk
at
the
the
bees
that
sucked
in
the
blossoms
slim
and
the
wasps
that
built
on
the
lichened
limb
and
felt
the
silence
the
dusk
the
dread
of
the
spot
where
they
buried
the
unknown
dead
the
water
murmur
the
insect
hum
and
a
far
bird
calling
oh
come
what
sweeter
music
can
mortals
make
to
ease
the
heart
of
its
human
ache
and
it
seemed
in
my
dream
that
was
all
too
true
that
i
met
in
the
woods
again
with
you
a
face
and
brown
bare
knees
and
a
hand
stained
red
with
dewberries
and
we
stood
a
moment
some
thing
to
tell
and
then
in
the
woods
we
said
farewell
but
once
i
met
you
yet
lo
it
seems
again
and
again
we
meet
in
dreams
and
i
ask
my
soul
what
it
all
may
mean
if
this
is
the
love
that
should
have
been
and
oft
and
again
i
wonder
god
intends
be
changed
by
man
home
among
the
fields
the
camomile
seems
blown
steam
in
the
lightning
glare
unusual
odors
drench
the
air
night
speaks
above
the
angry
smile
of
storm
within
her
stare
the
way
for
me
is
through
the
wood
whose
branches
fill
the
road
with
dripping
till
between
the
boughs
a
light
our
home
upon
the
hill
the
path
for
me
to
take
it
goes
around
a
rock
puckered
pink
and
hollyhock
unto
a
unkempt
rose
and
door
whereat
i
knock
bright
on
the
the
lamp
streams
through
the
foggy
pane
the
door
is
opened
to
the
rain
and
in
the
door
her
happy
face
and
eager
hands
again
ashly
mere
come
look
in
the
shadowy
water
here
the
stagnant
water
of
ashly
mere
where
the
stirless
depths
are
dark
but
clear
what
is
the
thing
that
lies
there
a
half
sunk
from
sight
or
spawn
of
the
toad
all
or
ashen
blur
of
the
moon
wan
light
or
a
woman
face
and
eyes
there
now
lean
to
the
water
a
listening
ear
the
haunted
water
of
ashly
mere
what
is
the
sound
that
you
seem
to
hear
in
the
ghostly
hush
of
the
deeps
there
a
withered
reed
that
the
ripple
lips
or
a
wing
that
the
surface
whips
or
the
rain
in
a
leaf
that
drips
and
drips
or
a
woman
voice
that
weeps
there
now
look
and
listen
but
draw
not
near
the
lonely
water
of
ashly
mere
for
so
it
happens
this
time
each
year
as
you
lean
by
the
mere
and
listen
and
the
moaning
voice
i
understand
for
oft
i
have
watched
it
draw
to
land
and
lift
from
the
water
a
ghastly
hand
and
a
face
whose
eyeballs
glisten
and
this
is
the
reason
why
every
year
to
the
hideous
water
of
ashly
mere
i
come
when
the
woodland
leaves
are
sear
and
the
autumn
moon
hangs
hoary
for
here
by
the
mere
was
wrought
a
wrong
but
the
old
old
story
is
over
long
and
woman
is
weak
and
man
is
strong
and
the
mere
and
mine
is
the
story
before
the
tomb
the
way
went
under
cedared
gloom
to
moonlight
like
a
cactus
bloom
before
the
entrance
of
her
tomb
i
had
an
hour
of
night
and
thin
sad
starlight
and
i
set
my
chin
against
the
grating
and
looked
in
a
gleam
like
moonlight
through
a
square
of
opening
i
knew
not
where
shone
on
her
coffin
resting
there
and
on
its
oval
i
read
her
name
and
age
and
date
and
smiled
on
my
hate
there
was
no
insect
sound
to
chirr
no
wind
to
make
a
little
stir
i
stood
and
looked
and
thought
on
her
the
gleam
stole
downward
from
her
head
till
at
her
feet
it
rested
red
on
gothic
gold
that
sadly
said
god
to
her
love
lent
a
weak
reed
of
strength
and
gave
no
light
to
lead
pray
for
her
soul
for
it
hath
need
there
was
no
twitter
near
no
low
vague
water
i
might
hear
to
make
a
small
sound
in
the
ear
the
gleam
that
made
a
burning
mark
of
each
dim
word
died
to
a
spark
then
left
the
tomb
and
coffin
dark
i
had
a
little
while
to
wait
and
prayed
with
hands
against
the
grate
and
heart
that
yearned
and
knew
too
late
there
was
no
light
below
above
to
point
my
soul
the
way
thereof
the
way
of
hate
that
led
to
love
revisited
it
was
beneath
a
waning
moon
when
all
the
woods
were
sear
and
winds
made
eddies
of
the
leaves
that
whispered
far
and
near
i
met
her
on
the
old
we
parted
at
last
year
at
first
i
deemed
it
but
a
mist
that
faltered
in
that
place
an
autumn
mist
beneath
the
trees
that
sentineled
the
race
until
i
neared
and
in
the
moon
beheld
her
face
to
face
the
waver
of
the
upon
the
leas
the
shimmer
of
the
a
down
the
silences
the
gliding
of
the
between
the
swamp
and
trees
they
qualified
her
presence
as
a
sorrow
may
a
dream
the
vague
suggestion
of
a
self
the
glimmer
of
a
gleam
the
actual
unreal
of
the
things
that
only
seem
where
once
she
came
with
welcome
and
glad
eyes
all
she
passed
and
gave
no
greeting
that
my
heart
might
recognize
with
face
unseeing
and
sad
unremembering
eyes
it
was
beneath
a
waning
moon
when
woods
were
bleak
and
sear
and
winds
made
whispers
of
the
leaves
that
eddied
far
and
near
i
met
her
ghost
upon
the
bridge
we
parted
at
last
year
at
vespers
high
up
in
the
a
girl
stands
slim
and
fair
and
touched
with
the
casement
glory
gleams
out
her
radiant
hair
the
young
priest
kneels
at
the
altar
then
lifts
the
host
above
and
the
psalm
intoned
from
the
psalter
is
pure
with
patient
love
a
sweet
bell
chimes
and
a
censer
swings
gleaming
in
the
gloom
the
candles
glimmer
and
denser
rolls
up
the
pale
perfume
then
high
in
the
organ
choir
a
voice
of
crystal
soars
of
patience
and
soul
desire
that
suffers
and
adores
and
out
of
the
altar
dimness
an
answering
voice
doth
swell
of
passion
that
cries
from
the
grimness
and
anguish
of
its
own
hell
high
up
in
the
one
kneels
with
a
girlish
grace
and
touched
with
the
vesper
glory
lifts
her
madonna
face
one
stands
at
the
cloudy
altar
a
form
bowed
down
and
thin
the
text
of
the
psalm
in
the
psalter
he
reads
is
sorrow
and
sin
the
creek
o
cheerly
cheerly
by
the
road
and
merrily
down
the
billet
and
where
the
is
sowed
with
millet
then
a
pebbled
path
that
goes
through
vista
and
through
dingle
unto
a
farmstead
windowed
rose
and
roof
of
moss
and
shingle
o
darkly
darkly
through
the
bush
and
dimly
by
the
bowlder
where
cane
and
grow
lush
and
woodland
wilds
are
older
then
the
cedared
way
that
leads
through
burr
and
unto
a
of
weeds
fenced
in
with
broken
pickets
then
sadly
sadly
down
the
vale
and
wearily
through
the
rushes
where
sunlight
of
the
noon
is
pale
and
the
zephyr
hushes
for
oft
her
young
face
smiled
upon
my
deeps
here
and
oft
with
bare
feet
in
the
sun
my
shallows
there
she
waded
no
more
beneath
the
twinkling
leaves
shall
stand
the
farmer
daughter
sing
softly
past
the
cottage
eaves
o
water
no
more
shall
bend
her
laughing
face
above
me
where
the
rose
is
sigh
softly
past
the
where
all
her
youth
reposes
answered
do
you
remember
how
that
night
drew
on
that
night
of
sorrow
when
the
stars
looked
wan
as
eyes
that
gaze
reproachful
in
a
dream
loved
eyes
long
lost
and
sadder
than
the
grave
how
through
the
heaven
stole
the
moon
gray
gleam
like
a
nun
ghost
down
a
cathedral
nave
do
you
remember
how
that
night
drew
on
do
you
remember
the
hard
words
then
said
said
to
the
living
now
denied
the
dead
that
left
me
dead
long
long
before
i
died
in
heart
and
spirit
me
your
words
had
slain
telling
how
love
to
my
poor
life
had
lied
armed
with
the
dagger
of
a
pale
do
you
remember
the
hard
words
then
said
do
you
remember
now
this
night
draws
down
the
threatening
heavens
that
the
lightnings
crown
with
wrecks
of
thunder
when
no
moon
doth
give
the
clouds
wild
witchery
as
in
a
room
behind
the
sorrowful
arras
still
may
live
the
pallid
secret
of
the
haunted
do
you
remember
now
this
night
draws
down
do
you
remember
now
it
comes
to
pass
your
form
is
bowed
as
is
the
grass
and
death
hath
won
from
you
that
confidence
denied
to
life
now
your
sick
soul
rebels
against
your
pride
with
tragic
eloquence
that
demon
of
the
heart
fierce
do
you
remember
now
it
comes
to
pass
do
you
remember
bid
your
soul
be
still
here
passion
hath
surrendered
unto
will
and
flesh
to
spirit
quiet
your
wild
tongue
and
wilder
heart
your
kiss
is
naught
to
me
the
instrument
love
gave
you
lies
unstrung
silent
forsaken
of
all
melody
do
you
remember
bid
your
soul
be
still

i
the
leaves
are
shivering
on
the
thorn
drearily
and
sighing
wakes
the
morn
wearily

to
thee

would
god
had
let
me
die
wearily
ii
my
dreams
are
as
a
closed
up
book
drearily
upon
whose
clasp
of
love
i
look
wearily
all
night
the
rain
raved
overhead
drearily
all
night
i
wept
awake
in
bed
wearily
i
heard
the
wind
sweep
wild
and
wide
drearily
i
turned
upon
my
face
and
sighed
wearily
the
wind
and
rain
spake
unto
me
drearily
what
is
this
thing
god
takes
from
thee
wearily
i
said
unto
the
rain
and
wind
drearily
the
love
for
which
my
soul
hath
sinned
wearily

spake
unto
me
drearily

are
these
things

drearily
regret
and
hope
despair
hath
slain
wearily
thou
him
still
they
made
reply
drearily
i
said
that
god
would
let
me
die
wearily
finale
so
let
it
be
thou
wilt
not
say
was
i
here
in
life
temple
where
thy
soul
may
see
look
how
the
beauty
of
our
love
doth
lie
shattered
in
shards
a
dead
divinity
approach
kneel
down
yea
render
up
one
sigh
this
is
the
end
what
need
to
tell
it
thee
so
let
it
be
so
let
it
be
care
who
hath
stood
with
him
and
sorrow
who
sat
by
him
deified
for
whom
his
face
made
comfort
lo
how
dim
they
heap
his
altar
which
they
can
not
hide
while
memory
lamp
swings
it
burning
slim
this
is
the
end
what
shall
be
said
beside
so
let
it
be
so
let
it
be
did
we
not
drain
the
wine
red
of
love
sacramental
chalice
when
he
laid
sweet
sanction
on
thy
lips
and
mine
dash
it
aside
lo
who
will
fill
again
now
it
is
empty
of
the
god
divine
this
is
the
end
yea
let
us
say
amen
so
let
it
be
the
cross
the
cross
i
bear
no
man
shall
know
no
man
can
ease
the
cross
i
bear
alas
the
thorny
path
of
woe
up
the
steep
hill
of
care
there
is
no
word
to
comfort
me
no
sign
to
help
my
bended
head
deep
night
lies
over
land
and
sea
and
silence
dark
and
dread
to
strive
it
seems
that
i
was
born
for
that
which
others
shall
obtain
the
disappointment
and
the
scorn
alone
for
me
remain
one
half
my
life
is
overpast
the
other
half
i
contemplate
meseems
the
past
doth
but
forecast
a
darker
future
state
sick
to
the
heart
of
that
which
makes
me
hope
and
struggle
and
desire
the
aspiration
here
that
aches
with
ineffectual
fire
while
inwardly
i
know
the
lack
the
insufficiency
of
power
each
past
day
retrospect
makes
black
each
morrow
coming
hour
now
in
my
youth
would
i
could
die
as
others
love
to
live
go
down
into
the
grave
without
a
sigh
oblivious
of
renown
the
forest
of
dreams
i
where
was
i
last
friday
night
within
the
forest
of
dark
dreams
following
the
blur
of
a
that
led
me
over
ugly
streams
whereon
the
scum
of
the
spawn
was
spread
and
the
blistered
slime
in
stagnant
seams
where
the
weed
and
the
moss
swam
black
and
dead
like
a
drowned
girl
hair
in
the
ropy
ooze
and
the
light
that
led
flickered
the
trees
and
the
things
at
airy
cruise
ii
where
was
i
last
friday
night
within
the
forest
of
dark
dreams
following
a
form
of
shadowy
white
with
my
own
wild
face
it
seems
did
a
raven
wing
just
flap
my
hair
or
a
bat
brush
by
my
face
or
the
hand
of
something
i
did
not
dare
look
round
to
see
in
that
obscene
place
where
the
boughs
with
leaves
and
the
bush
where
the
wind
made
moan
had
more
than
a
strange
significance
of
life
and
of
evil
not
their
own
iii
where
was
i
last
friday
night
within
the
forest
of
dark
dreams
seeing
the
mists
rise
left
and
right
like
the
leathery
fog
that
heaves
and
steams
from
the
rolling
horror
of
hell
red
streams
while
the
wind
that
tossed
in
the
tattered
tree
and
danced
alone
with
the
last
mad
leaf
or
was
it
the
wind
kept
whispering
me
now
bury
it
here
with
its
own
black
grief
and
its
eyes
of
fire
you
can
not
brave
and
in
the
darkness
i
seemed
to
see
my
own
self
digging
my
soul
a
grave
lynchers
at
the
moon
let
it
be
on
the
quarry
bill
with
its
one
gnarled
tree
the
road
of
the
underbrush
where
the
woman
came
through
the
summer
hush
the
sumach
high
and
the
elder
thick
where
we
found
the
stone
and
the
ragged
stick
the
trampled
road
of
the
thicket
full
of
down
to
the
quarry
pool
the
rocks
that
ooze
with
the
hue
of
lead
where
we
found
her
lying
stark
and
dead
the
scraggy
wood
the
negro
hut
with
its
doors
and
windows
locked
and
shut
a
secret
signal
a
foot
rough
tramp
a
knock
at
the
door
a
lifted
lamp
an
oath
a
scuffle
a
ring
of
masks
a
voice
that
answers
a
voice
that
asks
a
group
of
shadows
the
moon
red
fleck
a
running
noose
and
a
man
bared
neck
a
word
a
curse
and
a
shape
that
swings
the
lonely
night
and
a
bat
black
wings
at
the
moon
let
it
be
on
the
quarry
hill
with
its
one
gnarled
tree
ku
klux
we
have
sent
him
seeds
of
the
melon
core
and
nailed
a
warning
upon
his
door
by
the
ku
klux
laws
we
can
do
no
more
down
in
the
hollow
crib
and
stack
the
roof
of
his
house
looms
black
not
a
line
of
light
at
the
doorsill

yet
arm
and
mount
and
mask
and
ride
the
hounds
can
sense
though
the
fox
may

and
for
a
word
too
much
men
oft
have
died
the
clouds
blow
heavy
towards
the
moon
the
edge
of
the
storm
will
reach
it
soon
the
killdee
cries
and
the
lonesome
loon
the
clouds
shall
flush
with
a
wilder
glare
than
the
lightning
makes
with
its
angled
flare
when
the
ku

verdict
is
given
there
in

the

written
grim
at

him

for

too
much
men
oft

rembrandts
i
shall
not
soon
forget
her
and
her
eyes
the
haunts
of
hate
where
suffering
seemed
to
write
its
own
dark
name
whose
syllables
are
sighs
in
strange
and
starless
night
i
shall
not
soon
forget
her
and
her
face
so
quiet
yet
uneasy
as
a
dream
that
stands
on
in
a
haunted
place
and
listens
for
a
scream
she
made
me
feel
as
one
alone
may
feel
in
some
grand
ghostly
house
of
olden
time
the
presence
of
a
treasure
walls
conceal
the
secret
of
a
crime
ii
with
lambent
faces
mimicking
the
moon
the
water
lilies
lie
dotting
the
darkness
of
the
long
lagoon
like
some
black
sky
a
face
the
whiteness
of
a
and
hair
in
shadow
half
half
in
the
moonbeams
glower
lifts
slowly
there
a
young
girl
face
death
makes
cold
marble
of
turned
to
the
moon
and
me
sad
with
the
pathos
of
unspeakable
love
floating
to
sea
iii
one
listening
bent
in
dread
of
something
coming
he
can
not
see
nor
balk
a
phantom
footstep
in
the
ghostly
gloaming
that
haunts
a
terraced
walk
long
has
he
given
his
whole
heart
hard
endeavor
unto
the
work
begun
still
hoping
love
would
watch
it
grow
and
ever
turn
kindly
eyes
thereon
now
in
his
life
he
feels
there
nears
an
hour
inevitable
alas
when
in
the
darkness
he
shall
cringe
and
cower
and
see
his
dead
self
pass
the
lady
of
the
hills
though
red
my
blood
hath
left
its
trail
for
five
far
miles
i
shall
not
fail
as
god
in
heaven
wills
the
way
was
long
through
that
black
land
with
sword
on
hip
and
horn
in
hand
at
last
before
thy
walls
i
stand
o
lady
of
the
hills
no
seneschal
shall
put
to
scorn
the
summons
of
my
no
shall
stay
yea
god
hath
helped
my
strength
too
far
by
wood
and
scar
to
give
it
pause
now
or
to
bar
my
way
this
hope
still
gives
my
body
strength
to
kiss
her
eyes
and
lips
at
length
where
all
her
kin
can
see
then
her
towers
of
crime
and
gloom
like
the
halls
of
doom
to
smite
her
dead
in
that
wild
room
with
revelry
madly
i
rode
nor
once
did
slack
before
my
face
the
world
rolled
black
with
nightmare
wind
and
rain
mocked
at
me
on
the
fen
and
through
the
forest
followed
then
gaunt
eyes
of
wolves
and
ghosts
of
men
moaned
by
me
on
the
plain
still
on
i
rode
my
way
was
clear
from
that
wild
time
when
spear
to
spear
deep
in
the
wood
i
met
him
dead
he
lies
beneath
their
trysting
oak
i
clenched
my
teeth
and
rode
my
wound
scarce
let
me
breathe
that
filled
my
eyes
with
blood
and
here
i
am
the
blood
may
blind
my
eyesight
now
yet
i
shall
find
her
by
some
inner
eye
for
god
he
hath
this
deed
in
care
yea
i
shall
kiss
again
her
hair
and
tell
her
of
her
leman
there
then
smite
her
dead
and
die
revealment
at
moonset
when
ghost
speaks
with
ghost
and
spirits
meet
where
once
they
sinned
between
the
bournes
of
found
and
lost
my
soul
met
her
soul
on
the
wind
my
evalind
i
kissed
her
mouth
her
face
was
wild
two
burning
shadows
were
her
eyes
wherefrom
the
maiden
love
that
smiled
a
heartbreak
smile
of
severed
ties
gazed
with
a
wan
surprise
then
suddenly
i
seemed
to
see
no
more
her
shape
where
beauty
bloomed
my
own
sad
self
gazed
up
at
me
my
sorrow
that
had
so
assumed
the
form
of
her
entombed
heart
encouragement
nor
time
nor
all
his
minions
of
sorrow
or
of
pain
shall
dash
with
vulture
pinions
the
cup
she
fills
again
within
the
of
life
where
she
doth
reign
clothed
on
with
bright
desire
and
hope
that
makes
her
strong
with
limbs
of
frost
and
fire
she
sits
above
all
wrong
her
heart
a
living
lyre
her
love
its
only
song
and
in
the
waking
pauses
of
weariness
and
care
and
when
the
dark
hour
draws
his
black
weapon
of
despair
above
effects
and
causes
we
hear
its
music
there
the
longings
life
hath
near
it
of
love
we
yearn
to
see
the
dreams
it
doth
inherit
of
immortality
are
callings
of
her
spirit
to
something
yet
to
be
nightfall
o
day
so
sicklied
with
night
o
dreadful
fruit
of
fallen
dusk
a
circe
orange
with
horror
its
husk
and
i
who
gave
the
promise
heed
that
made
life
tempting
surface
fair
have
i
not
eaten
to
the
seed
its
ashes
of
despair
o
silence
of
the
drifted
grass
and
immemorial
eloquence
of
stars
and
winds
and
waves
that
pass
and
god
indifference
leave
me
alone
with
sleep
that
knows
not
any
thing
that
life
may
keep
not
the
pulse
that
comes
and
goes
in
germs
that
climb
and
creep
or
if
an
aspiration
pale
must
quicken
there
oh
let
the
spot
grow
weeds
that
dost
may
so
prevail
where
spirit
once
could
not
pause
so
sick
of
dreams
the
dreams
that
stain
the
aisle
along
which
life
must
pass
with
hues
of
mystic
colored
glass
that
fills
the
windows
of
the
brain
so
sick
of
thoughts
the
thoughts
that
carve
the
house
of
days
with
arabesques
and
gargoyles
where
the
mind
grotesques
in
masks
of
hope
and
faith
who
starve
here
lay
thy
over
weary
head
upon
my
bosom
do
not
weep
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
heart
of
my
heart
be
comforted
above
the
vales
we
went
by
ways
of
bygone
days
up
mountain
heights
of
story
where
lost
in
vague
historic
haze
tradition
crowned
with
sat
her
ruins
hoary
where
wing
to
wing
the
eagles
cling
and
torrents
have
their
sources
war
rose
with
bugle
voice
to
sing
of
wild
spear
thrust
and
broadsword
swing
and
rush
of
men
and
horses
then
deep
below
where
orchards
show
a
home
here
here
a
steeple
we
heard
a
simple
shepherd
go
singing
beneath
the
afterglow
a
of
the
people
as
in
the
trees
the
song
did
cease
with
matron
eyes
and
holy
peace
from
the
cornlands
of
increase
and
of
love
victories
spake
smiling
of
the
lowly
a
sunset
fancy
wide
in
the
west
a
lake
of
flame
that
seems
to
shake
as
if
the
midgard
snake
deep
down
did
breathe
an
isle
of
purple
glow
where
rosy
rivers
flow
down
peaks
of
cloudy
snow
with
fire
beneath
and
there
the
with
windows
all
frowns
on
a
burning
height
wherein
she
sleeps
young
through
the
years
of
doom
veiled
with
her
hair
gold
gloom
the
pale
valkyrie
whom
enchantment
keeps
the
the
misty
rain
makes
dim
my
face
the
night

me
i
tread
the
dripping
a
flickering
light
before
me
out
of
the
death
of

that
rot
and
ooze
and
weedy
water
my
form
was
breathed
to

this
spot
death
immaterial

the

that
whoops
upon
the
yew
the

my

fantastic
minute

when
grave
the
twilight
settles
my
roof
and
from
the
haggard
oaks
unto
my
door
the
rain
comes
wild
as
one
who
rides
before
his
enemies
that
follow
hoof
to
hoof
and
in
each
window
gusty
the
sighs
like
one
who
mutters
some
tale
of
love
and
crime
and
on
the
floor
the
sunset
spreads
red
stains
as
bloody
proof
from
hall
to
hall
and
stealthy
stair
to
stair
through
all
the
house
a
dread
that
drags
me
toward
the
ancient
dusk
of
that
avoided
room
wherein
she
sits
with
ghostly
golden
hair
and
eyes
that
gaze
beyond
her
soul
sad
doom
bending
above
an
unreal
harpsichord
pr√¶terita
low
belts
of
rushes
ragged
with
the
blast
lagoons
of
marish
reddening
with
the
west
and
the
marsh
the
unrest
while
daylight
dwindles
and
the
dusk
falls
fast
set
in
sad
walls
all
mossy
with
the
past
an
old
stone
gateway
with
a
crumbling
crest
a
garden
where
death
drowses
manifest
and
in
gaunt
yews
the
shadowy
house
at
last
here
like
some
unseen
spirit
silence
talks
with
echo
and
the
wind
in
each
gray
room
where
melancholy
slumbers
with
the
rain
or
like
some
gentle
ghost
the
moonlight
walks
in
the
dim
garden
which
her
smile
makes
bloom
with
all
the
loveliness
again
the
swashbuckler
and
broad
of
big
and
pompous
port
a
tavern
visage
apoplexy
haunts
all
the
resort
of
fat
debauchery
whose
veined
cheek
flaunts
a
flabby
purple
he
stands
in
rakehell
boots
and
belt
and
hanger
that
claps
when
with
greasy
gauntlets
on
his
hands
he
swaggers
past
in
cloak
and
hat
aggression
marches
armies
in
his
words
and
in
his
oaths
great
deeds
ride
his
looks
his
gestures
breathe
the
breath
of
swords
and
in
his
carriage
camp
all
wars
to
be
with
him
of
battles
there
shall
be
no
lack
while
buxom
wenches
are
and
stoops
of
sack
the
witch
she
gropes
and
hobbies
where
the
dropsied
rocks
are
hairy
with
the
lichens
and
the
twist
of
knotted
mumbling
in
the
mist
and
with
scrawny
locks
at
her
bent
back
the
moonlight
mocks
like
some
lewd
evil
whom
the
fiend
hath
kissed
thrice
at
her
feet
the
slipping
serpent
hissed
and
thrice
the
owl
called
to
the
forest
what
sabboth
brew
dost
now
intend
what
root
dost
seek
for
seal
for
what
satanic
spell
of
incantations
and
demoniac
fire
from
thy
rude
hut
in
the
brier
what
dark
familiar
points
thy
sure
pursuit
with
burning
eyes
gaunt
with
the
glow
of
hell
the
somnambulist
oaks
and
a
water
by
the
water
eyes
and
steadfast
as
cold
stars
and
hair
yellow
as
eyes
deep
in
a
lair
and
limbs
like
darkness
that
the
lightning
dyes
the
humped
oaks
stand
black
under
iron
skies
the
dry
wind
whirls
the
dead
leaves
everywhere
wild
on
the
water
falls
a
vulture
glare
of
moon
and
wild
the
circling
raven
flies
again
the
power
of
this
thing
hath
laid
illusion
on
him
and
he
seems
to
hear
a
sweet
voice
calling
him
beyond
his
gates
to
love
he
comes
each
forest
glade
seems
reaching
out
white
arms
to
draw
him
near
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
death
that
waits
opium
reading
de
quincey
confessions
of
an
opium
eater
i
seemed
to
stand
before
a
temple
walled
from
shadows
and
night
unrealities
filled
with
dark
music
of
dead
memories
and
voices
lost
in
darkness
aye
that
called
i
entered
and
beneath
the
dome
immensity
one
forced
me
to
my
knees
before
a
blackness
throned
semblances
and
spectres
crowned
with
flames
of
emerald
then
lo
two
shapes
that
thundered
at
mine
ears
the
names
of
horror
and
oblivion
priests
of
this
god
and
bade
me
die
and
dream
then
in
the
heart
of
hell
a
thousand
years
meseemed
i
lay
dead
while
the
iron
stream
of
time
beat
out
the
seconds
one
by
one
music
and
sleep
these
have
a
life
that
hath
no
part
in
death
these
circumscribe
the
soul
and
make
it
strong
between
the
breathing
of
a
dream
and
song
building
a
world
of
beauty
in
a
breath
unto
the
heart
the
voice
of
this
one
saith
ideals
its
emotions
live
among
unto
the
mind
the
other
speaks
a
tongue
of
visions
where
the
guess
we
christen
faith
may
face
the
fact
of
immortality
as
may
a
rose
its
unembodied
scent
or
star
its
own
reflected
radiance
we
do
not
know
these
save
unconsciously
to
whose
mysterious
shadows
god
hath
lent
no
certain
shape
no
certain
countenance
ambition
now
to
my
lips
lift
then
some
opiate
of
black
forgetfulness
while
in
thy
gaze
still
lures
the
loveless
beauty
that
betrays
and
in
thy
mouth
the
music
that
is
hate
no
promise
more
hast
thou
to
make
me
wait
no
smile
to
cozen
my
sick
heart
with
praise
far
far
behind
thee
stretch
laborious
days
and
far
before
thee
labors
soon
and
late
thine
is
the
that
we
deem
a
star
flying
before
us
ever
fugitive
thy
mocking
policy
still
holds
afar
and
thine
the
voice
to
which
our
longings
give
hope
siren
face
that
speaks
us
sweet
and
fair
only
to
lead
us
captives
to
despair
despondency
not
all
the
bravery
that
day
puts
on
of
gold
and
azure
ardent
or
austere
shall
ease
my
soul
of
sorrow
grown
more
dear
than
all
the
joy
that
heavenly
hope
may
don
far
up
the
skies
the
rumor
of
the
dawn
may
run
and
eve
like
some
wild
torch
appear
these
shall
not
change
the
darkness
gathered
here
of
thought
that
rusts
like
an
old
sword
undrawn
oh
for
a
place
from
the
sun
a
wildwood
cave
of
primitive
rocks
and
moss
where
sleep
and
silence
breast
to
married
breast
lie
with
their
child
oblivion
where
freed
from
all
the
trouble
of
my
cross
i
might
forget
i
might
forget
and
rest
despair
shut
in
with
phantoms
of
life
hollow
hopes
and
shadows
of
old
sins
satiety
slew
and
the
young
ghosts
of
the
dead
dreams
love
knew
out
of
the
day
into
the
night
she
gropes
behind
her
high
the
silvered
summit
slopes
of
strength
and
faith
she
will
not
turn
to
view
but
towards
the
cave
of
weakness
harsh
of
hue
she
goes
where
all
the
dropsied
horror
ropes
there
is
a
voice
of
waters
in
her
ears
and
on
her
brow
a
wind
that
never
dies
one
is
the
anguish
of
desired
tears
one
is
the
sorrow
of
unuttered
sighs
and
burdened
with
the
immemorial
years
downward
she
goes
with
never
lifted
eyes
sin
there
is
a
legend
of
an
old
hartz
tower
that
tells
of
one
a
noble
who
had
sold
his
soul
unto
the
fiend
who
grew
not
old
on
this
condition
that
the
demon
power
cease
every
midnight
for
a
single
hour
and
in
that
hour
his
body
should
be
cold
his
limbs
grow
shriveled
and
his
face
behold
become
a
in
the
taper
so
unto
sin
life
gives
his
best
her
arts
make
all
his
outward
seeming
beautiful
before
the
world
but
in
his
heart
of
hearts
abides
an
hour
when
her
strength
is
null
when
he
shall
feel
the
death
through
all
his
parts
strike
and
his
countenance
become
a
skull
insomnia
it
seems
that
dawn
will
never
climb
the
eastern
hills
and
clad
in
mist
and
flame
and
rime
make
flashing
highways
of
the
rills
the
night
is
as
an
ancient
way
through
some
dead
land
whereon
the
ghosts
of
memory
and
sorrow
wander
hand
in
hand
by
which
man
works
ignoble
seem
unbeautiful
and
grandeur
but
the
ruined
dream
of
some
proud
queen
crowned
with
a
skull
a
way
dark
and
old
that
stretches
far
its
only
real
thing
the
cold
vague
light
of
sleep
one
fitful
star
encouragement
to
help
our
tired
hope
to
toil
lo
have
we
not
the
council
here
of
trees
that
to
all
hope
appear
as
sermons
of
the
soil
to
help
our
flagging
faith
to
rise
lo
have
we
not
the
high
advice
of
stars
that
for
all
faith
suffice
as
gospels
of
the
skies
sustain
us
lord
and
help
us
climb
with
hope
and
faith
made
strong
and
great
the
pathway
of
our
fate
the
way
of
time
quatrains
penury
above
his
misered
embers
gnarled
and
gray
with
limbs
he
bends
around
his
hut

a
hobbling
hag
goes
night

scolding
at

silent
sister
and
the
daughter
deep
of
contemplation
she
who
spreads
below
a
hostile
tent
soft
comfort
for
her
foe
with
eyes
of
jael
watching
till
he
sleep
tempest
with
helms
of
lightning
glittering
in

terrific
beauty
in
their

in
rainy
raiment
met
the

summer
for
a
moonlit
hour
sweet
from
their

warm
and
wet
earth
shaped
the
fragrant
purity
of
this
flower
melancholy
with
shadowy
immortelles
of
memory
about
her
brow
she
sits
with
eyes
that
look
upon
the
stream

two
shadows
image
them

one
is
life

one
is
love

death
sorrow
death
takes
her
hand
and
leads
her
through
the
waste
of
her

soul
wherein
she
hears
the
voice
of
lost
love
tears
and
famishing
can

taste
the
