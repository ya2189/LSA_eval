myra
well
a
tale
of
it
is
the
night
of
all
nights
of
the
year
when
ghosts
and
warlocks
haunt
the
troubled
earth
and
disembodied
spirits
visit
us
spirits
of
good
and
evil
from
the
dead
fresh
from
the
angel
hosts
and
from
the
damned
and
from
the
vast
profound
betwixt
the
two
spirits
from
living
bodies
disenthralled
by
bless√©d
sleep
or
yearnings
most
intense
or
by
more
subtle
agencies
beyond
our
ken
bearing
portentious
messages
to
those
who
in
full
faith
the
future
would
behold
the
radiance
of
a
frosty
moon
lights
up
and
darkens
all
the
growth
around
the
great
trees
stand
out
black
against
the
stars
the
wind
in
gusts
bestirs
the
autumn
leaves
whose
late
october
tints
are
lost
in
gloom
or
are
grown
pallid
with
their
shivering
whose
fitful
rustlings
are
the
only
sounds
which
break
the
dead
cold
silence
of
the
night
yet
hist
faint
eerie
tones
are
sometimes
heard
which
blanch
the
cheek
and
palsy
all
the
limbs
like
to
the
moaning
of
departed
souls
within
the
is
a
large
high
room
unceiled
but
studded
thick
with
rafters
old
grown
black
with
age
or
smoke
around
its
walls
stiff
hams
and
dimly
seen
and
here
and
there
the
dim
uncertain
forms
of
and
chairs
and
metal
mugs
from
the
low
windows
half
across
the
floor
stretch
bands
of
moonlight
flecked
with
shadowed
leaves
which
tremble
till
the
moonlight
seems
to
dance
beside
the
fireplace
stands
some
wood
but
the
great
hearthstone
opens
cold
and
black
beneath
the
inner
door
a
chink
of
light
seems
but
to
make
the
dimness
darker
yet
the
only
sound
the
of
the
clock
which
serves
to
make
the
silence
audible
high
on
the
hill
a
lordly
pile
looks
down
from
its
proud
eminence
and
grand
domain
upon
the
in
the
vale
below
builded
of
marble
lofty
turretted
it
looms
beneath
the
moonlight
the
trees
like
some
etherial
castle
in
the
skies
limned
in
white
alabaster
glistening
grand
unreal
weird
not
made
by
mortal
hands
but
sudden
as
one
wrapt
gaze
takes
it
in
it
turns
to
gray
then
vanishes
yet
no
is
but
a
sudden
cloud
athwart
the
moon
within
the
castle
in
a
sumptuous
room
sits
young
sir
bertram
morven
all
alone
he
had
been
reading
that
sweet
persian
tale
of
him
who
knocked
at
the
beloved
one
door
and
cried
is
i
who
loveth
thee
to
whom
she
answering
said
thou
canst
not
enter
here
and
how
a
twelvemonth
past
he
knocked
again
and
the
beloved
one
asking
who
art
thou
replied
it
is
thyself
and
entered
in
the
dull
flames
at
his
feet
leap
fitfully
and
lights
and
shadows
sweep
across
his
brow
like
thoughts
of
heaven
and
hell
across
the
soul
back
in
holt
what
a
change
is
there
the
raftered
room
is
filled
with
light
and
sound
from
blackened
hearth
the
joyful
flames
leap
up
and
roar
and
crackle
through
the
logs
on
either
side
the
old
holts
sit
and
smile
betwixt
them
circled
sit
the
younger
ones
who
laugh
and
chat
until
the
old
man
cries
be
silent
children
let
us
not
forget
the
ancient
usage
of
our
family
the
feast
of
sah
has
come
the
sacred
fire
the
fire
of
peace
is
kindled
on
the
hearth
all
hallowed
one
whose
warmth
is
like
this
fire
which
giveth
joy
and
comfort
to
us
all
be
present
with
us
in
the
coming
storms
bless
us
and
keep
us
in
the
coming
year
whereat
the
others
joining
in
o
thou
and
all
thy
saints
protect
us
all
the
year
while
the
flames
leap
and
crackle
all
the
more
and
roar
a
joyous
answer
to
the
prayer
after
a
silence
of
a
little
space
when
thoughts
are
busy
with
the
days
the
farmer
speaks
again
good
wife
says
he
we
know
the
past
with
all
its
ills
and
joys
we
need
not
rake
its
ashes
again
the
present
finds
us
hale
and
hearty
yet
blest
in
our
children
and
our
steadfast
love
he
who
would
solve
the
future
in
advance
hath
yet
to
learn
the
lessons
of
content
but
feasting
on
contentment
is
poor
fare
what
say
you
to
some
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
and
ada
daughter
bring
my
pipe
and
hettie
niece
the
apples
and
the
nuts
and
john
my
son
pile
up
more
blazing
logs
a
chilly
tremor
through
my
bones
just
ran
as
if
some
enemy
walked
my
grave
a
shadowy
form
shrouded
and
hooded
bent
with
weight
of
years
and
wickedness
perchance
creeps
slowly
towards
the
glowing
and
peers
within
she
sees
the
emptied
mugs
and
pipes
the
scattered
which
tell
a
tale
of
in
their
chairs
the
old
folks
dozing
john
and
hettie
sit
most
strangely
near
together
on
the
floor
stands
ada
beauteous
maiden
all
alone
swaying
most
gracefully
from
side
to
side
with
uplift
hand
and
circling
apple
rind
which
sudden
drops
and
forms
a
doubtful
b
with
blushing
face
and
hands
her
eyes
softened
with
yearning
hope
are
raised
to
where
the
moonlight
strives
to
enter
holy
saints
what
is
it
ails
the
maid
she
saw
a
face
glued
to
the
a
hideous
face
she
said
which
gibed
and
seemed
to
mock
and
threaten
dire
calamity
and
waving
crutch
which
beckoned
her
outside
tush
tush
my
girl
the
farmer
cries
twas
but
a
fancy
ho
john
go
outside
and
but
to
satisfy
her
look
around
john
goes
and
soon
returns
he
has
well
searched
yet
searched
in
vain
no
mortal
is
in
sight
so
reassured
the
old
man
mug
is
filled
his
pipe
more
wood
piled
on
the
fire
and
as
he
craves
it
ada
sings
a
song
ada
song
a
noble
knight
lordly
halls
dreams
all
his
life
away
a
lowly
maid
in
cottage
walls
the
rippling
waterfalls
permits
her
heart
to
stray
his
image
mirrored
in
her
heart
heaven
help
thee
lowly
maid
so
near
and
yet
so
far
apart
he
tells
his
love
she
doth
not
start
nor
move
nor
seem
afraid
a
gruesome
gulf
between
us
spread
she
cries
sir
knight
beware
fate
spans
that
gulf
with
mystic
thread
so
frail
that
only
souls
may
tread
impalpable
as
air
like
ancient
roc
i
wing
my
flight
he
whispers
o
be
mine
i
wing
thee
to
my
castle
height
and
wed
thee
sweet
she
answers
bright
then
i
dear
love
am
thine
the
while
she
sang
with
more
than
human
art
her
voice
like
a
bird
she
seemed
to
see
a
vision
of
the
knight
and
seemed
to
be
the
maiden
of
the
song
and
half
her
heart
expressed
its
love
in
words
while
all
her
soul
beamed
from
her
glorious
eyes
and
at
the
last
her
rounded
arms
outstretched
seemed
to
embrace
the
hero
of
her
song
while
ada
sings
what
happens
at
the
hall
sir
bertram
still
sits
gazing
at
the
fire
seeing
strange
shapes
and
embered
phantasies
come
and
depart
and
come
again
more
strange
while
his
set
gaze
grows
painful
and
his
mind
whirls
with
conflicting
conscience
and
desire
for
he
hath
seen
the
beauteous
lovely
maid
and
loved
her
from
the
moment
that
he
saw
loved
her
yet
dared
not
wed
nor
whisper
love
and
now
he
seems
to
see
her
in
her
home
her
golden
tresses
rippling
her
brow
her
violet
eyes
lit
up
with
love
own
light
turned
full
upon
himself
o
ravishment
while
her
song
enthralls
his
soul
o
love
he
cries
sweet
love
be
mine
indeed
thou
pearl
of
beauty
goddess
of
my
heart
her
outstretched
arms
appear
to
welcome
him
he
raises
his
to
clasp
her
to
his
breast
when
lo
the
vision
vanishes
and
loud
the
hoarse
clangs
out
the
hour
of
ten
he
rises
hastily
and
treads
the
floor
what
was
it
elpsie
croaked
as
home
he
rode
that
very
evening
elpsie
that
old
hag
what
devil
had
inspired
her
lad
ere
this
i
see
thy
loved
one
swoon
in
thine
enamored
arms
and
then
she
laughed
uncannily
and
struck
her
crutch
against
the
ash
and
mumbled
revenge
is
come
at
last
what
could
she
mean
impossible
yet
when
hath
elpsie
prophesied
in
vain
his
heart
beats
fast
his
blood
begins
to
surge
his
head
to
swim
more
air
he
cries
more
air
a
long
brisk
walk
will
shake
these
fancies
off
meanwhile
the
song
grown
silent
at
the
farm
the
ended
and
the
and
done
with
now
they
sit
the
old
man
snoring
while
the
old
dame
nods
the
young
ones
telling
stories
of
the
eve
how
janet
smith
last
did
see
her
left
shoulder
after
certain
rites
the
face
of
john
smith
who
soon
married
her
and
how
the
was
good
no
doubt
and
how
the
colewort
prophecies
were
sure
and
how
the
test
was
surer
still
but
best
of
all
the
image
in
the
well
stories
which
creep
and
breed
a
shallow
laugh
perchance
with
inward
shuddering
and
fear
until
a
sharp
gust
shakes
the
as
in
the
grip
of
some
strong
hand
and
with
a
start
the
old
folks
wake
again
good
man
is
long
past
ten
the
old
dame
cries
well
well
good
wife
the
hours
creep
on
apace
the
sacred
fire
doth
need
replenishment
and
we
grow
older
feebler
with
the
years
and
soon
must
leave
to
younger
stronger
hands
the
toils
and
troubles
and
the
joys
of
life
as
now
we
yield
to
them
this
vigil
strict
another
mug
and
pipe
and
then
to
bed
the
image
in
the
well
what
well
and
where
from
farm
and
castle
full
a
mile
away
near
to
an
ancient
tree
a
druid
oak
the
old
well
stands
its
waters
deep
and
pure
its
stones
much
worn
by
age
and
use
in
olden
days
so
runs
the
legend
when
the
good
king
arthur
and
his
chosen
knights
upheld
the
right
and
lifted
womanhood
by
force
of
arms
to
heights
almost
divine
a
recreant
knight
betrayed
a
gentle
maid
and
she
ashamed
to
let
the
thing
be
known
fled
from
her
home
into
the
forest
wild
and
grieved
and
wept
her
very
soul
away
and
when
she
died
the
tale
is
often
told
and
all
the
people
there
believe
it
true
from
the
hard
earth
beside
her
gushed
a
spring
fed
as
they
say
by
all
the
tears
she
shed
which
on
a
day
when
arthur
passed
that
way
and
heard
the
story
sad
he
bade
be
walled
with
masonry
as
monument
he
said
to
teach
all
coming
time
that
mother
earth
hath
more
of
heart
and
faith
than
recreant
knight
and
named
it
myra
well
and
passed
along
and
later
when
the
false
knight
rode
that
way
he
was
beset
dismounted
beaten
stripped
and
sorely
wounded
in
a
fray
and
crawled
to
myra
well
not
knowing
of
the
tale
and
kneeled
to
slake
his
thirst
and
bending
low
saw
her
reproachful
face
and
seeing
died
scarcely
a
from
poor
myra
well
sheltered
and
hid
by
woods
and
undergrowth
a
low
hut
leans
against
rocks
old
elpsie
home
beshunned
by
humankind
of
which
strange
stories
had
been
gossiped
how
fifty
years
ago
on
at
midnight
in
a
storm
a
wayward
youth
losing
his
way
had
stumbled
on
the
hut
and
found
it
tenanted
and
peeping
in
beheld
a
maiden
all
alone
reclining
on
a
couch
the
fire
how
he
had
prayed
admittance
from
the
storm
how
pity
beat
the
wall
of
prudence
down
and
how
he
took
advantage
of
her
state
and
how
she
cursed
him
in
her
crazy
shame
and
prayed
god
blast
all
issue
of
his
loins
until
the
wrong
should
be
atoned
in
kind
and
how
as
years
ran
by
though
rarely
seen
the
maid
became
a
withered
hag
and
practised
witchcraft
and
foul
sorcery
but
whence
she
came
or
who
she
was
or
why
she
was
called
elpsie
none
could
say
they
knew
alone
for
sure
that
farmer
holt
had
once
near
to
the
graveyard
in
the
dead
of
night
seen
by
the
moonlight
riding
on
a
broom
straight
from
the
castle
to
the
hut
beyond
a
form
and
face
like
elpsie
in
the
air
scattering
on
all
sides
curses
as
she
flew
and
people
fearful
were
of
meeting
her
and
even
feared
to
pass
by
myra
well
from
the
low
thatch
of
elpsie
hut
upcurls
a
dimly
seen
beneath
the
eaves
black
shadows
fall
save
where
a
yellow
gleam
dull
and
uncertain
from
a
crevice
pours
from
a
crane
within
the
hut
a
great
black
pot
is
simmering
a
fire
whose
flickering
light
bewrays
a
couch
a
stool
and
crouching
by
the
fire
the
tattered
form
the
matted
hair
the
skin
of
elpsie
elbowing
her
knees
her
jowl
supported
like
a
wedge
between
her
palms
crouching
and
swaying
feebly
back
and
forth
her
gaze
intent
upon
the
shifting
scum
or
on
the
greenish
vapor
it
exudes
the
while
her
cracked
voice
croons
uncannily
elpsie
croon
in
the
halls
of
the
morvens
the
shall
fail
when
the
great
mountain
heaves
and
comes
down

very

then
shall
happiness
fall
upon
morven
dark
race
how
comes
sir
bertram
here
at
such
a
time
and
has
his
walk
dispelled
his
phantasies
through
the
crisp
faintly
booms
a
bell
is
from
the
castle
there
is
myra
well
eleven
and
still
a
mile
from
home
and
there
is
elpsie
hut
what
did
she
mean
and
as
he
notes
the
dull
outpouring
light
the
cranny
grows
more
bright
and
larger
seems
what
could
that
mean
a
moment
more
would
tell
and
then
he
hears
the
warlock
prophecy
he
peers
within
and
sees
or
seems
to
see
a
sweet
and
maiden
all
alone
reclining
on
a
couch
the
fire
he
rubs
his
eyes
as
dreaming
looks
again
and
sees
an
empty
couch
dull
flickering
flames
and
toothless
elpsie
rocking
to
and
fro
then
he
remembers
with
a
start
that
once
o
long
ago
he
knows
not
when
nor
where
he
had
a
dream
distinct
and
plain
as
this
in
which
he
saw
this
maid
upon
the
couch
and
then
the
toothless
hag
and
after
that
beside
a
well
could
that
be
myra
kneeling
on
the
curb
her
golden
hair
by
the
moon
and
violet
eyes
lit
up
by
love
divine
his
ada
his
and
then
there
came
a
mist
which
blotted
from
his
all
the
rest
ten
thousand
limping
devils
could
it
be
the
well
had
magic
power
that
she
had
heard
that
she
this
night
would
test
it
thus
thought
he
and
then
old
elpsie
words
known
to
fail
by
all
the
saints
and
souls
i
wait
and
see
from
out
the
of
the
farmer
house
the
old
folks
long
since
gone
and
fast
asleep
goes
pretty
hettie
once
before
this
eve
she
went
a
short
space
with
john
both
blindfold
to
pull
kail
but
now
alone
under
her
arm
a
bag
half
full
of
seed
the
which
at
midnight
she
must
sow
and
looking
back
will
see
the
reaper
come
gathering
the
growing
crop
her
future
spouse
scarce
is
she
hid
from
view
when
after
her
steps
forth
sly
john
a
sickle
in
his
hand
then
from
the
front
steals
ada
trembling
one
half
startled
at
the
shadows
on
the
lawn
and
takes
the
myra
well
the
wind
sighs
softly
through
the
falling
leaves
and
she
sighs
half
responsively
the
bark
of
distant
hound
sounds
strangely
near
the
low
of
cattle
seems
like
groan
and
sends
strange
shudders
through
her
hurrying
frame
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
or
snapping
twig
makes
her
heart
beat
more
quickly
than
a
clock
an
hundred
times
before
she
sees
the
well
she
clasps
her
rosary
and
says
a
prayer
and
wishes
she
were
home
again
once
more
yet
hurries
all
the
faster
on
her
way
and
once
a
frightened
hare
dashed
swift
across
her
ghostly
path
and
shook
with
terror
all
her
comely
limbs
and
once
she
saw
two
eyes
two
piercing
eyes
that
sparkled
a
bush
and
made
her
giddy
till
she
signed
the
cross
and
saw
a
great
black
cat
flit
fast
away
strange
shapes
on
either
hand
she
seemed
to
see
which
gibed
and
waved
long
shadowy
arms
and
shook
long
fingers
at
her
once
she
thought
she
saw
betwixt
a
and
the
moon
a
witches
form
with
elpsie
face
and
heard
or
thought
she
heard
harsh
maledictions
fall
and
once
she
slipt
and
nearly
fell
with
fright
upon
a
slimy
moving
thing
that
crawled
and
thrice
she
heard
the
dreaded
howl
and
thrice
a
snake
did
hiss
at
her
and
thrice
she
heard
the
hooting
of
an
owl
below
above
on
all
sides
sharp
beset
with
horrid
shapes
and
phantasies
and
threats
which
grew
more
numerous
and
portentious
still
as
she
came
nearer
to
the
sacred
well
until
her
limbs
could
scarcely
bear
her
form
and
all
her
faith
seemed
vanishing
in
fear
and
courage
almost
failed
expectancy
at
last
thank
god
the
sacred
well
in
sight
she
kneels
some
minutes
more
to
tell
her
beads
and
gather
breath
and
strength
and
that
repose
and
fixity
of
purpose
needed
for
the
coming
test
then
rising
looking
not
to
right
or
left
she
comes
unto
the
well
an
open
space
near
by
the
sacred
oak
and
kneeling
at
the
curb
with
eyes
uplift
she
addeth
to
her
other
prayers
these
words
o
sainted
myra
sanctified
by
death
and
sorrows
such
as
moved
both
earth
and
heaven
o
sainted
myra
purified
through
tears
of
which
this
well
bears
witness
night
and
day
and
thou
o
holy
mother
in
whose
heart
the
erring
find
a
sympathy
and
mediate
help
o
help
me
now
i
pray
if
this
be
sin
to
wish
to
know
the
truth
that
truth
which
fond
hearts
find
within
this
well
forgive
the
sin
and
save
me
of
thy
grace
her
pensive
pose
her
small
her
hair
like
golden
threads
in
silvery
air
bestirred
the
beauty
of
her
angel
face
her
eyes
lit
with
divine
effulgence
like
twin
stars
her
trustful
innocence
and
faith
would
melt
a
heart
of
stone
to
worship
at
her
feet
with
outstretched
arms
and
timid
touch
of
curb
thinking
the
time
has
come
she
forward
bends
looks
down
upon
the
glassy
surface
then
and
as
she
looks
the
startled
air
resounds
with
clanging
bell
which
strikes
the
hour
of
twelve
now
holy
mary
spare
that
lovely
maid
what
sees
she
there
at
first
the
pool
seems
dark
a
cloud
perchance
swift
coursing
the
moon
and
only
dimly
visible
a
shape
but
as
she
looks
the
shape
grows
clearer
till
she
sees
the
image
of
sir
bertram
face
o
bertram
dear
sir
bertram
god
be
thanked
she
cries
that
bertram
will
be
lord
of
me
and
then
she
sees
two
faces
in
the
well
her
own
and
his
an
arm
steals
her
waist
startled
she
turns
and
swoons
in
bertram
arms
he
holds
her
close
to
his
impassioned
breast
kissing
her
hair
and
eyes
and
cheeks
and
mouth
then
feels
the
beating
of
her
fluttering
heart
and
prays
her
to
come
back
to
life
and
him
he
chafes
her
small
white
hands
and
dainty
limbs
and
from
the
well
drops
water
on
her
brow
but
all
in
vain
so
cold
and
still
she
lies
like
living
beauty
sudden
smit
with
death
fool
that
i
was
the
anxious
lover
cries
i
have
worked
harm
indeed
by
coming
forth
thus
oft
we
hurt
the
one
we
love
most
dear
and
learn
too
late
the
folly
of
an
hour
he
lifts
her
gently
in
his
loving
arms
and
bears
her
easily
to
elpsie
hut
no
elpsie
there
the
door
wide
open
stands
and
lays
her
on
the
couch
renews
the
fire
and
on
his
bended
knee
by
ada
side
regards
her
sadly
and
adoringly
soon
he
perceives
a
tremor
her
steal
swift
fluttering
of
her
breath
a
sudden
gasp
a
sigh
and
then
her
eyes
unclose
her
violet
eyes
so
tender
and
so
true
yet
with
a
between
the
lids
and
gaze
half
mournfully
at
him
then
soft
and
musical
her
low
voice
sounds
again
my
bertram
mine
methought
i
had
a
dream
and
in
that
dream
i
lost
thee
thou
my
life
and
yet
through
all
that
dream
another
dream
in
which
thou
madest
me
all
thine
own
thy
wife
and
rained
soft
kisses
on
my
lips
and
brow
and
guarded
me
like
christ
and
all
his
saints
and
held
me
safely
to
thy
noble
breast
through
all
of
good
or
ill
but
thou
art
pale
and
on
thy
face
swift
shadows
come
and
go
come
kiss
me
love
the
night
is
cold
not
thou
for
warm
thy
brown
cheek
is
as
flesh
and
blood
and
now
i
feel
thy
sweet
breath
on
my
brow
are
spirits
all
as
palpable
as
thou
and
then
half
startled
by
the
sudden
doubt
where
am
i
bertram
here
upon
my
heart
thou
secure
and
safe
with
him
who
is
thyself
from
henceforth
and
for
aye
whether
for
good
or
ill
but
surely
good
here
in
old
elpsie
hut
the
well
at
which
i
found
thee
and
didst
bring
thee
here
frightened
by
sudden
seeing
of
a
face
that
looked
the
love
it
owns
o
holy
saints
o
shame
what
have
i
done
poor
ada
cries
it
all
comes
back
with
harrowing
circumstance
alas
to
curse
my
woe
is
me
and
here
broke
down
with
sudden
storm
of
tears
of
tears
and
sighs
nay
nay
dear
heart
he
chides
and
clasps
her
close
the
churchmen
hold
it
true
that
all
which
rightly
ends
is
justified
i
always
loved
thee
sweet
from
the
first
day
but
dared
not
wed
nor
even
woo
a
bride
a
curse
is
on
our
house
when
yet
a
child
old
elpsie
told
me
how
ancestral
sin
had
brought
it
down
from
father
unto
son
and
thence
to
me
my
grandsire
died
unshriven
by
his
own
hand
is
said
beside
this
well
and
all
his
children
died
quite
suddenly
by
deaths
almost
as
strange
and
i
alone
am
left
the
last
one
of
the
line
dare
i
bring
misery
and
death
to
her
i
love
as
i
love
thee
thou
lovest
me
sir
knight
a
lowly
maiden
in
a
forest
lone
ah
honest
love
would
make
no
chaffer
thus
thou
hintest
what
thy
proud
lips
dare
not
say
dallying
like
wanton
bee
about
a
flower
hath
honor
fled
from
man
nay
nay
mine
own
banish
distrust
and
fear
the
hand
of
fate
is
in
our
meeting
none
save
she
to
blame
there
is
a
moment
in
each
being
life
on
which
that
being
destiny
doth
hang
a
moment
fateful
and
for
both
of
us
that
moment
now
has
come
around
the
head
of
god
a
nimbus
floats
is
the
divine
effulgence
of
his
truth
and
all
his
saints
do
borrow
of
that
light
and
even
men
do
share
its
guiding
beams
i
ask
thy
hand
in
wedlock
lovely
maid
if
thou
wilt
brave
the
curse
with
me
the
curse
ten
thousand
curses
would
i
risk
with
thee
as
thy
leal
wife
to
such
a
knight
as
thou
my
bertram
my
true
knight
no
ill
shall
fall
but
should
it
come
then
let
it
fall
on
me
yet
heaven
is
kind
and
mary
merciful
o
holy
one
most
merciful
to
me
sir
bertram
saw
sweet
ada
safely
home
and
as
he
left
her
from
the
woods
his
heart
with
his
happiness
he
saw
a
light
was
elpsie
hut
in
flames
beside
the
well
now
stands
a
cosy
lodge
sir
bertram
built
for
elpsie
and
the
hut
which
heard
their
vows
that
night
exists
no
more
sir
bertram
built
a
chapel
on
its
site
and
thence
that
coming
christmas
took
his
bride
his
lovely
ada
to
her
the
home
of
morven
the
great
mountain
who
had
gone
down
to
the
vale
to
meet
his
love
of
bertram
the
bright
raven
who
with
ease
by
moonlight
in
of
the
night
had
carried
ada
form
a
holt
and
holt
means
forest
in
our
saxon
tongue
and
when
old
elpsie
died
she
left
a
will
which
told
the
wrong
that
bertram
grandsire
did
to
her
the
of
his
winsome
bride
and
left
her
dying
blessing
on
the
twain
and
she
was
buried
in
the
chapel
vault
and
prayers
were
said
to
save
her
soul
from
hell
and
often
in
the
they
came
sir
bertram
and
his
lady
with
their
sons
and
daughters
and
the
holts
at
times
with
theirs
for
john
and
hettie
now
were
parents
too
and
decked
the
tomb
with
sweet
and
often
lingered
by
poor
myra
well
