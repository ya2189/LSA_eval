poor
maiden
the
brother
thrice
in
the
night
the
priest
arose
from
broken
sleep
to
kneel
and
pray
poor
ghost
till
the
red
cock
crows
and
i
a
mass
for
your
soul
may
thrice
he
went
to
the
chamber
cold
where
stiff
and
still
uncoffinèd
his
brother
lay
his
beads
he
told
and
poor
spirit
rest
he
said
thrice
lay
the
old
priest
down
to
sleep
before
the
morning
bell
should
toll
but
still
he
woke
to
the
crying
of
his
soul
all
through
the
dark
till
dawn
was
pale
the
priest
tossed
in
his
misery
with
muffled
ears
to
hide
the
wail
the
voice
of
that
agony
at
last
the
red
cock
flaps
his
wings
to
trumpet
of
a
day
the
lark
awaking
soaring
sings
into
the
bosom
of
the
morn
the
priest
before
the
altar
stands
he
hears
the
spirit
call
for
peace
he
beats
his
breast
with
shaking
hands
father
grant
this
release
just
and
merciful
set
free
from
awful
night
this
soul
to
fly
to
thee
and
rest
for
ever
in
thy
the
mass
is
the
clerk
kneels
pallid
in
the
morning
glow
he
said
evils
of
the
dark
oh
bless
me
father
ere
you
go
that
i
may
rest
for
all
night
did
the
banshee
the
priest
raised
up
his
hands
and
now
my
child
and
you
will
the
priest
went
down
the
vestry
stair
he
laid
his
vestments
in
their
place
and
pale
ghost
met
him
there
with
beads
of
pain
upon
his
face
he
said
have
gained
me
peace
but
why
so
long
did
you
know
my
tears
and
say
no
mass
for
my
release
to
save
the
torture
of
all
those
years
rest
you
brother
the
good
priest
said
years
have
a
single
he
showed
the
body
uncoffinèd
and
the
six
wax
candles
still
alight
the
living
flowers
on
the
dead
breast
blew
out
a
perfume
sweet
and
strong
the
spirit
paused
ere
he
passed
to
save
your
soul
from
a
night
so
the
ballad
of
the
little
black
hound
who
knocks
at
the
door
in
the
black
storm
and
the
rain
with
the
thunder
crash
and
the
shrieking
wind
comes
the
moan
of
a
pain
and
once
they
knocked
yet
never
a
stir
to
show
that
the
geraldine
knew
and
twice
they
knocked
yet
never
a
bolt
the
listening
geraldine
drew
and
thrice
they
knocked
ere
he
moved
his
chair
and
said
it
be
i
dare
not
open
the
door
for
a
fear
that
has
come
to
three
times
he
rises
from
out
his
chair
and
three
times
he
sits
him
down
what
has
made
faint
this
heart
of
mine
he
says
with
a
growing
frown
what
has
made
me
a
coward
who
never
knew
fear
before
but
i
swear
that
the
hand
of
a
little
child
keeps
pulling
me
from
the
the
geraldine
rose
from
his
chair
at
last
and
opened
the
door
full
wide
is
out
in
the
storm
said
he
in
name
come
inside
he
who
was
out
in
the
storm
and
rain
drew
back
at
the
call
who
comes
not
in
the
holy
name
will
never
come
in
at
he
looked
to
the
right
he
looked
to
the
left
and
never
a
one
saw
he
but
right
in
his
path
lay
a
coal
black
hound
right
piteously
in
he
cried
little
black
hound
come
in
i
will
ease
your
pain
my
roof
shall
keep
you
at
least
from
the
leash
of
wind
and
the
geraldine
took
up
the
little
black
hound
and
put
him
down
by
the
fire
sleep
you
there
poor
wandering
one
as
long
as
your
heart
the
geraldine
tossed
on
his
bed
that
night
and
never
asleep
went
he
for
the
crowing
of
his
little
red
cock
that
did
crow
most
woefully
for
the
howling
of
his
own
that
cried
at
the
gate
all
night
he
rose
and
went
to
the
banquet
hall
at
the
first
of
morning
light
he
looked
to
the
right
he
looked
to
the
left
at
the
rug
where
the
dog
lay
on
but
the
reindeer
skin
was
burnt
in
two
and
the
little
black
hound
was
gone
and
traced
in
the
ashes
these
words
he
read
the
soul
of
your
firstborn
son
i
will
make
you
rich
as
you
once
were
rich
ere
the
glass
of
your
luck
was
the
geraldine
went
to
the
west
window
and
then
he
went
to
the
east
and
saw
his
desolate
pasture
fields
and
the
stables
without
a
beast
be
it
as
i
love
no
woman
no
son
shall
ever
be
mine
i
would
that
my
stables
were
full
of
steeds
and
my
cellars
were
full
of
swear
it
as
i
love
no
woman
and
never
a
son
have
i
i
would
that
my
sheep
and
their
little
lambs
should
flourish
and
multiply
yours
be
the
soul
of
my
firstborn
here
the
geraldine
slyly
smiled
but
from
the
dark
of
the
lonely
room
came
the
cry
of
a
little
child
the
geraldine
went
to
the
west
window
he
opened
and
out
did
lean
and
lo
the
pastures
were
full
of
kine
all
chewing
the
grass
so
green
and
quickly
he
went
to
the
east
window
and
his
face
was
pale
to
see
for
lo
he
saw
to
the
empty
stalls
brave
steeds
go
three
by
three
the
geraldine
went
to
the
great
hall
door
in
wonder
at
what
had
been
and
there
he
saw
the
prettiest
maid
that
ever
his
eyes
had
seen
and
long
he
looked
at
the
pretty
young
maid
and
swore
there
was
none
so
fair
and
his
heart
went
out
of
him
like
a
hound
and
hers
like
a
timid
hare
each
day
he
followed
her
up
and
down
and
each
night
he
could
not
rest
until
at
last
the
pretty
young
maid
her
love
for
him
confessed
they
wooed
and
they
wed
and
the
days
went
by
as
quick
as
such
good
days
will
and
at
last
came
the
cry
of
his
firstborn
son
the
cup
of
his
joy
to
fill
and
the
summer
passed
and
the
winter
came
right
fair
was
the
child
to
see
and
he
laughed
at
the
shriek
of
a
bitter
storm
as
he
sat
on
his
knee
who
rings
so
loud
at
the
gate
who
knocks
so
loud
at
the
door
rise
you
up
my
pretty
young
wife
for
twice
they
have
knocked
quickly
she
opened
the
great
hall
door
and
you
in
she
cried
but
there
only
entered
a
little
black
hound
and
he
would
not
be
denied
when
the
geraldine
saw
the
little
black
dog
he
rose
with
a
fearful
cry
sold
my
child
to
the
hound
in
forgotten
days
gone
he
drew
his
sword
on
the
little
black
hound
but
it
would
not
pierce
its
skin
he
tried
to
pray
but
his
lips
were
dumb
because
of
his
grievous
sin
then
the
fair
young
wife
took
the
black
throat
both
her
small
white
hands
between
and
he
thought
he
saw
one
of
angels
where
his
sweet
young
wife
had
been
then
he
thought
he
saw
from
spirit
the
hound
go
sore
oppressed
but
he
woke
to
find
his
own
dead
wife
with
her
dead
child
on
her
breast
quickly
he
went
to
the
west
window
quickly
he
went
to
the
east
no
help
in
the
desolate
pasture
fields
or
the
stables
that
held
no
beast
he
flung
himself
at
his
white
side
and
the
dead
lips
moved
and
smiled
then
came
somewhere
from
the
lonely
room
the
laugh
of
a
little
child
the
rape
of
the
wine
who
was
stealing
the
wine
golden
sherry
and
port
so
old
precious
i
wot
as
drops
of
gold
lone
he
came
to
dine
flung
himself
in
his
oaken
chair
kicked
the
hound
that
whined
for
bread
the
thief
shall
swing
he
said
thrust
his
hand
through
his
ruffled
hair
bolt
and
bar
and
double
chain
held
secure
the
cellar
door
and
the
watchman
placed
before
kept
a
faithful
watch
in
vain
every
day
the
story
came
come
i
hear
it
drip
the
wine
is
wet
on
the
lip
who
the
robber
none
could
name
all
the
folk
in
county
clare
found
a
task
for
every
day
by
the
gate
to
stray
came
to
gossip
stayed
to
stare
nothing
here
to
satisfy
souls
for
tragedy
awake
just
the
castle
by
the
lake
calmest
spot
beneath
the
sky
but
the
whispered
story
grew
when
the
baron
went
to
dine
that
a
devil
shared
his
wine
had
his
soul
in
danger
too
every
morn
the
baron
rose
more
morose
and
full
of
age
passed
the
day
in
sullen
rage
barred
his
gates
on
friends
or
foes
lone
he
came
to
dine
struck
the
hound
that
asked
a
share
heard
a
step
upon
the
the
thief
is
at
your
wine
baron
of
killowen
keep
running
down
the
vaulted
way
to
the
cellar
dark
by
day
took
the
ten
steps
at
a
leap
there
he
listened
with
the
throng
of
frighted
servants
at
the
door
he
heard
the
wine
drip
on
the
floor
and
laughter
loud
and
long
of
oaken
beam
of
bolt
and
chain
they
freed
the
door
and
crowded
through
their
eyes
a
horror
claimed
in
vain
nor
ghost
nor
devil
met
their
view
they
searched
behind
the
hogshead
where
the
watchful
spider
spied
and
span
they
sighed
to
see
the
wine
that
ran
a
crimson
torrent
wasting
there
they
even
searched
the
gloomy
well
that
legend
said
rose
from
the
lake
they
saw
bright
bubbles
rise
and
break
but
nothing
stranger
here
befell
the
baron
baron
said
all
be
gone
alone
stay
there
shall
not
rise
another
day
without
this
thief
alive
or
so
still
he
stood
no
sound
was
there
but
just
the
wine
went
drop
and
drip
save
that
the
silence
seemed
to
slip
its
threatening
fingers
through
his
hair
and
then
as
last
an
echo
flew
the
splash
of
waters
thrown
apart
he
cursed
the
beating
of
his
heart
because
the
thief
was
listening
too
the
slipping
scrape
of
scales
he
hears
and
laughter
loud
and
sweet
he
dares
not
move
his
frightened
feet
his
pulse
beats
with
a
thousand
fears
at
that
strange
monster
in
the
gloom
he
points
his
pistol
quick
and
fires
before
the
powder
spark
expires
he
hears
a
scream
of
doom
he
saw
one
gleam
of
arms
of
eyes
of
sloak
brown
hair
he
had
a
glance
to
find
her
fair
when
he
had
slain
her
thousand
charms
the
baron
of
killowen
slew
a
strange
young
and
fair
and
all
the
folk
in
county
clare
will
tell
you
that
the
tale
is
true
and
when
the
baron
came
to
dine
his
guests
could
never
understand
that
he
should
say
with
glass
in
hand
would

maiden
who
lies
in

cold
and
the
rain
who
drew

bolts
at

into
my
house
bade
him
go
the
mother
of
the
poor
young
maiden
who
lies
in
her
youth
so
stands
that
he
dare
not
enter
the
door
of
my
chamber
between
the
ghost
of
the
fair
little
maiden
who
lies
in
the
churchyard
at
christmas
time
for
that
old
love
i
once
adored
i
decked
my
halls
and
spread
my
board
at
christmas
time
with
all
the
flowers
that
grow
i
wreathed
my
room
and
mistletoe
hung
in
the
gloom
of
my
doorway
wherein
my
dear
lost
love
might
stray
when
chime
what
phantom
was
it
entered
there
and
drank
his
wine
and
took
his
chair
at
christmas
time
with
holly
boughs
and
mistletoe
he
crowned
his
head
and
at
my
woe
and
tears
i
shed
laughed
long
and
loud
back
o
phantom
to
thy
shroud
when
a
weeping
cupid
why
love
i
thought
you
were
gay
and
fair
merry
of
mien
and
debonair
what
then
means
this
brow
so
black
whose
sullen
gloom
twin
eyes
give
back
poor
little
god
in
tears
alack
why
love
i
thought
in
your
smiling
cheek
dainty
dimples
played
hide
and
seek
passing
by
like
a
night
with
stormy
sighs
from
lips
all
white
poor
little
god
how
comes
your
plight
a
maiden
said
you
were
tall
and
bold
with
an
arm
of
steel
and
a
heart
of
gold
whose
changing
face
would
make
her
day
when
came
a
frown
the
sunshine
play
of
smiles
would
chase
the
clouds
away
a
youth
once
said
you
were
like
a
maid
with
sunny
hair
in
a
golden
braid
whose
cheeks
were
each
a
rose
uncurled
and
brow
a
lilybell
unfurled
the
fairest
maid
in
all
the
world
why
love
i
find
you
so
weak
and
small
a
human
child
not
a
god
at
all
two
angry
sleepy
eyes
that
cry
two
little
hands
so
soft
and
shy
hush
you
with
a
lullaby
come
love
the
lover
i
go
through
wet
spring
woods
alone
through
sweet
green
woods
with
heart
of
stone
my
weary
foot
upon
the
grass
falls
heavy
as
i
pass
the
cuckoo
from
the
distance
cries
the
lark
a
pilgrim
in
the
skies
but
all
the
pleasant
spring
is
drear
i
want
you
dear
i
pass
the
summer
meadows
by
the
autumn
poppies
bloom
and
die
i
speak
alone
so
bitterly
for
no
voice
answers
me
lovers
parting
by
the
gate
o
robin
singing
to
your
mate
plead
you
well
for
she
will
hear
love
you
dear
i
crouch
alone
unsatisfied
mourning
by
fireside
o
fate
what
evil
wind
you
blow
must
this
be
so
no
southern
breezes
come
to
bless
so
conscious
of
their
emptiness
my
lonely
arms
i
spread
in
woe
i
want
you
so
a
bird
from
the
west
at
the
grey
dawn
amongst
the
felling
leaves
a
little
bird
outside
my
window
swung
high
on
a
topmost
branch
he
trilled
his
song
and
ireland
ireland
ever
sung
take
me
i
cried
back
to
my
island
home
sweet
bird
my
soul
shall
ride
between
thy
wings
for
my
lone
spirit
wide
his
pinions
spread
and
home
and
home
and
home
he
ever
sings
we
lingered
over
ulster
stern
and
wild
i
called
doth
none
remember
me
one
turnèd
in
the
darkness
murmuring
loud
upon
the
breakers
sobs
the
sea
we
rested
over
said
awake
and
welcome
i
am
one
woke
and
shivered
at
the
morning
grey
trees
i
never
heard
them
sigh
so
we
flew
low
over
munster
long
i
wept
used
to
love
me
love
me
once
again
they
spoke
from
out
the
shadows
wondering
think
of
tears
so
bitter
falls
the
long
over
leinster
lingered
we
my
best
beloved
for
sleepless
they
tossed
and
whispered
to
the
dawn
sad
a
wind
was
never
heard
was
it
a
dream
i
dreamt
for
yet
there
swings
in
the
grey
morn
a
bird
upon
the
bough
and
ireland
ireland
ever
sings
oh
fair
the
breaking
day
in
ireland
now
all
eve
i
cried
all
night
to
you
i
called
till
day
was
here
perhaps
you
could
not
come
or
were
too
tirèd
dear
your
chair
i
set
by
mine
i
made
the
dim
hearth
glow
i
whispered
he
comes
i
shall
not
let
him
i
closed
the
shutters
tight
i
feared
the
dawn
of
day
i
stopped
the
busy
clock
that
timed
your
hours
away
loud
howled
my
dog
o
glad
was
i
to
hear
the
dead
are
going
by
now
you
will
come
my
dear
to
take
the
chair
by
until
the
cock
would
o
if
it
be
you
came
and
could
not
let
me
know
for
once
a
shadow
passed
behind
me
in
the
room
i
thought
your
loving
eyes
would
meet
mine
in
the
gloom
and
once
i
thought
i
heard
a
footstep
by
my
chair
i
raised
my
eager
hands
but
no
sweet
ghost
was
there
we
were
too
wide
you
in
your
spirit
i
knew
not
when
you
came
i
could
not
understand
your
eyes
perhaps
met
mine
reproached
me
through
the
gloom
alas
for
me
alone
the
empty
empty
room
the
dead
were
passing
home
the
cock
crew
loud
and
clear
mavourneen
if
you
came
i
knew
not
you
were
here
an
imperfect
revolution
they
crowded
weeping
from
the
house
crying
aloud
their
fear
at
what
he
taught
old
men
and
young
men
wives
and
maids
unwed
and
children
screaming
in
the
crowds
unsought
some
to
their
temples
with
accustomed
feet
the
oxen
go
beneath
the
rod
to
fling
themselves
before
some
pictured
saint
god
help
us
if
there
is
no
some
to
the
of
their
dying
kind
to
clasp
with
arms
afraid
to
loose
their
hold
some
to
a
falling
on
a
grave
to
kiss
the
carven
name
with
lips
as
cold
some
watched
from
break
of
day
into
the
night
the
flash
of
birds
the
bloom
of
flower
and
tree
the
whirling
worlds
that
glimmer
in
the
dark
all
said
help
us
if
no
god
there
some
hid
in
caves
and
chattered
mad
with
fear
at
the
uprising
of
the
patient
poor
suffers
with
you
no
more
could
they
say
thus
lock
with
keys
of
heaven
their
bonds
secure
some
called
their
dead
and
then
remembering
fell
abusing
death
and
cursed
the
wormy
grave
and
wept
for
their
long
paradise
help
us
if
there
be
no
god
to
save
and
others
sought
for
right
and
found
it
not
and
seeking
duty
found
that
it
was
dead
blamed
their
long
blameless
lives
and
vowed
no
more
to
sacrifice
for
is
they
said
and
pleasure
leaping
in
the
streets
with
sin
caroused
through
many
days
till
wearily
she
tired
and
met
with
death
in
bitter
pain
god
help
us
if
no
god
we
a
few
rose
up
and
speaking
be
strong
were
answered
no
reason
for
your
right
but
many
crept
in
thankfulness
for
rest
into
the
darkness
out
of
sight
and
others
with
their
limbs
deformed
or
sore
seared
flesh
shrieked
out
their
patient
years
of
pain
crying
to
death
for
their
lost
plains
of
heaven
god
help
us
if
no
god
we
love
deep
in
the
moving
depths
of
yellow
wine
i
swore
drown
your
face
o
love
of
mine
all
clad
in
yellow
hue
so
fair
to
see
you
crouched
within
my
cup
and
laughed
at
me
twice
a
learned
page
i
turned
and
tossed
for
would
i
not
forget
the
love
i
lost
all
stern
and
robed
in
gloom
you
read
it
too
i
could
not
see
the
saw
only
you
within
the
hungry
chase
i
thought
to
kill
you
love
who
haunted
thus
without
my
will
but
in
the
gentle
gaze
of
fawn
and
deer
your
eyes
disarmed
my
hand
and
shook
my
spear
beneath
a
dark
lash
i
swore
drown
sink
in
the
laughing
give
in
go
down
but
no
you
bathèd
there
right
joyously
and
from
her
liquid
eyes
you
laughed
at
me
wishes
i
wish
we
could
live
as
the
flowers
live
to
breathe
and
to
bloom
in
the
summer
and
sun
to
slumber
and
sway
in
the
heart
of
the
night
and
to
die
when
our
glory
had
done
i
wish
we
could
love
as
the
bees
love
to
rest
or
to
roam
without
sorrow
or
sigh
with
laughter
when
after
the
wooer
had
won
love
flew
with
a
whispered
i
wish
we
could
die
as
the
birds
die
to
fly
and
to
fall
when
our
beauty
was
best
no
trammels
of
time
on
the
years
of
our
face
and
to
leave
but
an
empty
nest
cupid
slain
i
come
from
a
burial
hush
let
me
be
i
have
put
away
my
love
fair
exceedingly
ah
the
little
gold
curls
soft
about
his
face
now
my
heart
is
sorrowful
for
his
but
he
would
pursue
me
never
let
me
rest
till
i
turned
and
slew
him
knowing
it
were
best
laid
his
bow
beside
him
shovelled
in
the
clay
forget
him
let
me
weep
what
will
you
give
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
will
wed
golden
gown
to
come
sweetly
down
and
deck
you
from
foot
to
how
will
you
keep
me
if
i
am
cold
a
heart
so
warm
the
bravest
storm
dare
not
force
through
my
strong
how
will
you
please
me
if
i
should
thirst
by
the
rape
of
the
purple
grape
which
the
summer
and
sun
have
if
i
should
hunger
what
may
i
eat
you
the
skies
the
falcon
flies
and
the
hounds
on
the
stag
are
how
can
you
comfort
when
fair
youth
dies
when
the
fain
for
a
purer
gain
than
the
satisfied
flesh
supplies
this
i
promise
when
starved
and
cold
a
lonely
soul
finds
for
its
goal
a
bed
and
churchyard
a
meadow
tragedy
a
meadow
full
of
sunshine
ripe
grasses
lush
and
high
a
reaper
on
the
roadway
and
a
lark
hangs
in
the
sky
a
nest
of
love
enclosing
three
little
beaks
that
cry
the
reapers
in
the
meadow
and
a
lark
hangs
in
the
sky
a
mead
all
full
of
summer
and
tragedy
goes
by
with
a
knife
amongst
the
grasses
and
a
song
up
in
the
sky
an
eclipse
let
there
be
an
end
and
all
be
done
pass
over
fair
eclipse
that
hides
the
sun
dear
face
that
shades
the
light
and
shadows
me
begone
and
give
me
peace
and
set
me
free
the
scallop
shell
a
scallop
shell
loosed
by
the
lifting
tide
had
left
a
friendly
shore
the
seas
to
brave
its
lips
of
pink
and
snowy
hollow
shone
pure
in
the
sun
a
pearl
upon
the
wave
it
gleamed
and
burdened
it
with
love
with
sweet
long
futures
new
and
dreamy
days
and
named
for
i
held
your
hopes
i
bid
you
meriting
your
praise
i
pointed
where
your
vessel
came
to
shore
wrecked
where
the
tiny
breakers
rose
and
fell
and
bid
your
voyagers
not
put
to
sea
so
fail
a
craft
as
this
poor
scallop
shell
with
a
rose
in
the
heart
of
a
rose
lies
the
heart
of
a
maid
if
you
be
not
afraid
you
will
wear
it
who
knows
in
the
pink
of
its
bloom
lay
your
lips
to
her
cheek
since
a
rose
can
not
speak
and
you
gain
the
perfume
if
the
dews
on
the
leaf
are
the
tears
from
her
eyes
if
she
withers
and
dies
why
you
have
the
belief
that
a
rose
can
not
speak
though
the
heart
of
a
maid
in
its
bosom
must
fade
and
with
fading
must
break
for
ever
he
heard
it
first
upon
the
lips
of
love
and
loved
it
for
sake
a
faithful
word
that
knows
nor
time
nor
change
nor
lone
it
sung
across
his
like
a
breath
of
faithfulness
that
whispered
to
part
to
lose
to
linger
from
your
she
said
love
for
he
heard
it
then
upon
the
lips
of
death
of
things
that
fade
and
die
a
word
of
sorrow
never
to
be
stilled
an
ever
echoing
sigh
and
loneliness
within
his
soul
did
dwell
and
struck
upon
his
crying
to
meet
to
have
to
hold
to
see
she
said
for
the
blow
returned
i
struck
you
once
i
do
remember
well
hard
on
the
track
of
passion
sorrow
sped
and
swift
repentance
weeping
for
the
blow
i
struck
you
now
lying
dead
now
you
are
gone
the
blow
no
longer
sleeps
in
your
forgiveness
hushed
through
all
the
years
but
like
a
phantom
haunts
me
through
the
dark
to
cry
gave
your
own
belovèd
stript
now
of
all
excuses
stern
and
stark
with
all
your
small
transgressings
dimmed
or
fled
the
ghost
returns
the
blow
upon
my
heart
i
struck
you
now
lying
dead
vale
sweet
friend
and
all
the
world
must
be
between
my
friend
and
me
and
nothing
is
dear
heart
but
hands
that
meet
to
part
sweet
friend
sweet
love
and
one
long
grave
must
be
between
my
love
and
me
what
comfort
there
dear
heart
for
hands
that
meet
to
part
sweet
love
the
skeleton
in
the
cupboard
just
this
one
day
in
all
the
year
let
all
be
one
let
all
be
dear
wife
husband
child
in
fond
embrace
and
thrust
the
phantom
from
its
place
no
bitter
words
no
frowning
brow
disturb
the
christmas
festal
now
the
behind
the
door
nor
let
the
child
with
looks
askance
find
out
its
sad
inheritance
from
souls
that
held
no
happiness
of
home
where
love
is
seldom
guest
but
in
his
coming
years
retain
this
one
sweet
night
that
had
no
pain
the
behind
the
door
in
vain
you
raise
the
wassail
bowl
and
pledge
your
passion
soul
to
soul
you
hear
the
sweet
bells
ring
in
rhyme
you
wreath
the
room
for
christmas
time
in
vain
the
solemn
silence
falls
the
death
watch
ticks
within
the
walls
the
skeleton
taps
on
the
door
then
let
him
back
into
his
place
let
us
sit
out
the
old
disgrace
nor
seek
the
phantom
now
to
lay
that
haunted
us
through
every
day
for
plainer
is
the
ghost
useless
is
this
pretence
of
happiness
the
skeleton
taps
on
the
door
you
will
not
come
again
the
green
has
come
to
the
leafless
tree
the
earth
brings
forth
its
grain
the
flower
has
come
for
the
honey
bee
you
will
not
come
again
the
birds
have
come
to
the
empty
nest
all
winter
full
of
rain
so
music
has
come
where
the
silence
was
you
will
not
come
again
love
will
come
for
the
weak
cry
alas
for
my
dull
pain
in
the
cycle
of
change
i
alone
am
lone
you
will
not
come
again
the
wreckage
love
lit
a
beacon
in
thine
eyes
and
i
out
in
the
storm
and
lo
the
night
had
taken
wings
i
dream
me
safe
and
warm
love
lit
a
beacon
in
thine
eyes
a
light
for
me
my
heart
is
broken
on
the
rocks
i
perish
in
the
sea
i
am
the
world
i
am
the
song
that
rests
upon
the
cloud
i
am
the
sun
i
am
the
dawn
the
day
the
hiding
shroud
when
dusk
is
done
i
am
the
changing
colours
of
the
tree
the
flower
uncurled
i
am
the
melancholy
of
the
sea
i
am
the
world
the
other
souls
that
passing
in
their
place
each
in
their
groove
hands
that
chain
me
and
embrace
speak
and
reprove
atom
of
that
law
by
which
the
earth
is
poised
and
whirled
behold
you
hurrying
with
the
crowd
assert
you
are
the
am
i
not
one
with
all
the
things
that
be
warm
in
the
sun
all
that
my
ears
can
hear
or
eyes
can
see
till
all
be
done
of
song
and
shine
of
changing
leaf
apart
of
bud
uncurled
with
all
the
senses
pulsing
at
my
heart
i
am
the
world
one
day
the
song
that
drifts
upon
the
wind
i
shall
not
hear
nor
shall
the
rosy
shoots
to
eyes
grown
blind
again
appear
deaf
in
the
dark
i
shall
arise
and
throw
from
off
my
soul
the
withered
world
with
all
its
joy
and
woe
that
was
my
goal
i
shall
arise
and
like
a
shooting
star
slip
from
my
place
so
lingering
see
the
old
world
from
afar
revolve
in
space
and
know
more
things
than
all
the
wise
may
know
till
all
be
done
till
one
shall
come
who
breathing
on
the
stars
blows
out
the
sun
a
new
year
behold
a
new
white
world
the
falling
snow
has
cloaked
the
last
old
year
and
bid
him
go
cries
the
to
his
heart
my
sealèd
buds
shall
fling
their
leaves
apart
pipes
the
robin
and
again
how
sweet
the
nest
that
long
was
full
of
rain
bleats
the
sheep
and
one
by
one
my
little
lambs
shall
frolic
the
sun
for
us
too
let
some
fair
be
o
thou
who
weavest
threads
of
destiny
thou
wast
a
babe
on
that
far
christmas
day
let
us
as
children
follow
in
thy
way
so
that
our
hearts
grown
cold
time
and
pain
with
young
sweet
faith
may
blossom
green
again
that
empty
promises
of
passing
years
spring
into
life
and
not
repenting
tears
so
that
our
deeds
upon
the
earth
may
go
as
innocent
as
lambs
and
pure
as
snow
the
kine
of
my
father
the
kine
of
my
rather
they
are
straying
from
my
keeping
the
young
at
mischief
but
little
can
i
do
for
all
through
the
night
did
i
hear
the
banshee
keening
o
youth
of
my
loving
and
is
it
well
with
you
all
through
the
night
sat
my
mother
with
my
sorrow
it
is
the
wind
o
one
childeen
of
my
heart
my
hair
with
the
wind
and
my
two
hands
clasped
in
anguish
black
head
of
my
darling
too
long
are
we
apart
were
your
grave
at
my
feet
i
would
think
it
half
a
blessing
i
could
herd
then
the
cattle
and
drive
the
goats
away
many
a
paternoster
i
would
say
for
your
safe
keeping
i
could
sleep
above
your
heart
until
the
dawn
of
day
i
see
you
on
the
prairie
hot
with
thirst
and
faint
with
hunger
the
head
that
i
love
lying
low
upon
the
sand
the
vultures
shriek
impatient
and
the
coyote
dogs
are
howling
till
the
blood
is
pulsing
cold
within
your
clenching
hand
i
see
you
on
the
waters
so
white
so
still
forlorn
your
dear
eyes
unclosing
beneath
a
foreign
rain
a
plaything
of
the
winds
you
turn
and
drift
unceasing
no
grave
for
your
resting
o
mine
the
bitter
pain
all
through
the
night
did
i
hear
the
banshee
keening
somewhere
you
are
dying
and
nothing
can
i
do
my
hair
with
the
wind
and
my
two
hands
clasped
in
anguish
bitter
is
your
i
am
far
from
you
sanctuary
neighbour
for
pity
a
hound
cries
on
your
steps
with
pleading
eyes
with
sore
and
weary
feet
neighbour
your
pity
a
poor
beast
doth
implore
hunger
and
cold
are
busy
in
the
street
then
neighbour
pause
no
good
work
you
do
from
my
door
i
have
no
place
for
neighbour
your
mercy
a
heart
of
love
is
here
within
this
weary
is
rare
and
seldom
comes
to
cry
before
our
door
then
open
wide
and
take
your
little
share
love
pleads
to
be
your
servant
leal
and
true
from
my
step
i
have
no
place
for
from
step
to
step
abused
from
door
to
door
whipped
by
the
wind
and
beaten
by
the
rain
with
hunger
at
his
throat
he
passes
on
yet
one
who
follows
shares
the
pain
one
follows
neighbour
stop
unless
you
rue
from
my
step
i
have
no
place
for
the
gentle
christ
had
heard
his
crying
hound
and
left
his
throne
to
track
the
weary
feet
he
follows
though
unseen
with
bleeding
heart
refused
from
door
to
door
from
street
to
street
yes
one
who
follows
had
refusal
too
from
my
door
i
have
no
place
for
an
eastern
god
i
saw
an
eastern
god
my
comrades
laughed
lest
i
betray
my
secret
thoughts
i
mocked
him
too
his
many
hands
he
had
no
few
this
god
of
gifts
and
charity
the
marble
race
that
smiled
on
me
i
mocked
and
said
god
unthroned
lone
exile
from
the
faith
you
owned
no
priest
to
bring
you
sacrifice
no
censer
with
its
breath
of
spice
no
land
to
mourn
your
funeral
pyre
o
king
whose
subjects
felt
your
fire
now
dead
now
stone
without
a
slave
unfeared
unloved
you
have
no
grave
poor
god
who
can
not
understand
and
what
of
your
fair
eastern
land
what
dark
brows
brushed
your
dusky
feet
what
warm
hearts
on
your
marble
beat
with
many
a
prayer
unanswered
my
comrades
laughed
and
passed
i
said
in
those
lands
you
wander
still
in
spirit
god
and
work
your
will
i
whispered
in
the
marble
ear
so
the
walls
might
the
painted
lips
they
smiled
at
guard
my
love
he
a
friend
in
need
who
has
room
for
a
friend
who
has
money
to
spend
and
a
goblet
of
gold
for
your
fingers
to
hold
at
the
wave
of
whose
hand
leap
the
salmon
to
land
drop
the
birds
of
the
air
fall
the
stag
and
the
hare
who
has
room
for
a
friend
who
has
money
to
lend
we
have
room
for
a
friend
who
has
room
for
a
friend
who
has
nothing
to
lend
when
the
goblet
of
gold
is
as
far
from
his
hold
as
the
hare
or
the
birds
of
the
air
who
has
room
for
a
friend
who
has
nothing
to
spend
we
know
not
such
a
friend
in
a
wood
hush
thy
voice
no
but
a
bird
upon
the
bough
romancing
to
its
mate
but
where
art
thou
to
bid
my
heart
rejoice
thy
hand
speak
no
but
the
branches
striking
in
the
wind
let
loose
a
withered
leaf
that
falls
behind
blown
to
my
cheek
hush
thy
footfall
no
a
streamlet
hidden
in
the
fern
thus
from
dawn
to
dark
i
wait
i
learn
sorrow
is
all
a
vagrant
heart
o
to
be
a
woman
to
be
left
to
pique
and
pine
when
the
winds
are
out
and
calling
to
this
vagrant
heart
of
mine
whisht
it
whistles
at
the
windows
and
how
can
i
be
still
there
the
last
leaves
of
the
go
dancing
down
the
hill
all
the
boats
at
anchor
they
are
plunging
to
be
o
to
be
a
sailor
and
away
across
the
sea
when
the
sky
is
black
with
thunder
and
the
sea
is
white
with
foam
the
whirl
up
shrieking
and
seek
their
rocky
home
low
his
boat
is
lying
leeward
how
she
runs
upon
the
gale
as
she
rises
with
the
billows
nor
shakes
her
dripping
sail
there
is
danger
on
the
is
joy
where
dangers
alas
to
be
a
woman
and
the
heart
in
me
ochone
to
be
a
woman
only
sighing
on
the
with
a
soul
that
finds
a
passion
for
each
long
roar
with
a
heart
that
beats
as
restless
as
all
the
winds
that
thrust
a
cloth
between
her
fingers
and
tell
her
she
must
sew
must
join
in
empty
chatter
and
calculate
with
for
the
weighing
of
our
the
sake
of
social
laws
o
chatter
chatter
chatter
when
to
speak
is
misery
when
silence
lies
around
your
night
is
on
the
sea
so
tired
of
little
fashions
that
are
root
of
all
our
strife
of
all
the
petty
passions
that
upset
the
calm
of
life
the
law
of
god
upon
the
land
shines
steady
for
all
time
the
laws
confused
that
man
has
made
have
reason
not
nor
rhyme
o
bird
that
fights
the
heavens
and
is
blown
beyond
the
shore
would
you
leave
your
flight
and
danger
for
a
cage
to
fight
no
more
no
more
the
cold
of
winter
or
the
hunger
of
the
snow
nor
the
winds
that
blow
you
backward
from
the
path
you
wish
to
go
would
you
leave
your
world
of
passion
for
a
home
that
knows
no
riot
would
i
change
my
vagrant
longings
for
a
heart
more
full
of
quiet
no
all
its
dangers
there
is
joy
in
danger
too
on
bird
and
fight
your
tempests
and
this
nomad
heart
with
you
the
seas
that
shake
and
thunder
will
close
our
mouths
one
day
the
storms
that
shriek
and
whistle
will
blow
our
breaths
away
the
dust
that
flies
and
whitens
will
mark
not
where
we
trod
what
matters
then
our
judging
we
are
face
to
face
with
god
when
you
are
on
the
sea
how
can
i
laugh
or
dance
as
others
do
or
ply
my
rock
or
reel
my
heart
will
still
return
to
dreams
of
you
beside
my
my
little
dog
he
cried
out
in
the
dark
he
would
not
whisht
for
me
i
took
him
to
my
did
he
bark
when
you
were
on
the
sea
i
fear
the
red
he
crow
i
keep
him
close
and
warm
ill
with
me
if
he
should
wake
in
fright
and
you
out
in
the
storm
i
dare
not
smile
for
fear
my
laugh
would
ring
across
your
dying
ears
o
if
you
drifting
drowned
should
hear
me
sing
and
think
i
had
not
tears
i
never
thought
the
sea
could
wake
such
waves
nor
that
such
winds
could
be
i
never
wept
when
other
eyes
grew
blind
for
some
one
on
the
sea
but
now
i
fear
and
pray
all
things
for
you
how
many
dangers
be
i
set
my
wheel
aside
what
can
i
do
when
you
are
on
the
sea
my
garden
why
in
my
garden
are
the
flowers
more
sweet
than
mine
i
had
never
such
bloom
of
roses
such
yellow
and
pink
woodbine
why
in
my
garden
are
the
fruits
all
red
and
gold
while
here
the
grapes
are
bitter
that
hang
for
my
hold
why
in
my
garden
do
the
birds
all
fly
to
sing
over
the
fence
between
us
one
would
think
always
spring
i
thought
my
own
wide
garden
once
more
sweet
and
fair
than
all
till
i
saw
the
gold
and
crimson
just
over
my
wall
but
now
i
want
his
thrushes
and
now
i
want
his
vine
if
i
can
not
have
his
cherries
that
grow
more
red
than
mine
the
serpent
his
apples
will
tempt
me
to
my
fall
and
steal
my
fruit
across
the
garden
wall
an
irish
blackbird
this
is
my
brave
singer
with
his
beak
of
gold
now
my
a
captive
in
his
sweet
hold
o
the
a
rover
seeking
fields
above
but
my
serenader
hath
a
human
love
he
says
winter
nests
are
full
of
snow
but
a
truce
to
wailing
summer
breezes
he
sings
phantoms
cease
to
be
join
your
serenader
piping
on
his
o
my
little
lover
warble
in
the
blue
wingless
must
i
envy
skies
so
wide
for
you
death
of
gormlaith
gormlaith
wife
of
niall
glendu
happy
was
your
dream
that
night
dreamt
you
woke
in
sudden
fright
niall
of
ulster
stood
by
you
niall
of
ulster
dead
and
gone
many
a
year
had
come
again
him
who
was
in
battle
slain
now
your
glad
eyes
rest
upon
well
your
gaze
caressed
him
his
dark
head
you
loved
so
well
where
the
coulin
curled
and
fell
on
the
clever
brow
he
bore
those
brave
shoulders
wide
and
strong
many
a
dane
had
quaked
to
see
never
a
phantom
fair
as
he
wife
of
glendu
gazed
so
long
glad
queen
gormlaith
at
the
dawn
up
you
sprang
to
draw
him
near
ah
the
grey
cock
loud
and
clear
crew
and
then
the
ghost
was
gone
stretched
your
arms
in
vain
request
slipped
and
fell
and
wounded
sore
called
his
name
then
spake
no
more
for
the
pierced
your
breast
queen
your
smiling
lips
were
dumb
with
that
last
dear
name
you
cried
yet
some
had
it
ere
you
died
niall
of
ulster
whispered
unknown
ideal
whose
is
the
voice
that
will
not
let
me
rest
i
hear
it
speak
where
is
the
shore
will
gratify
my
quest
show
what
i
seek
not
yours
weak
muse
to
mimic
that
far
voice
with
halting
tongue
no
peace
sweet
land
to
bid
my
heart
rejoice
your
groves
among
whose
is
the
loveliness
i
know
is
by
yet
can
not
place
is
it
perfection
of
the
sea
or
sky
or
human
face
not
yours
my
pencil
to
delineate
the
splendid
smile
blind
in
the
sun
we
struggle
on
with
fate
that
glows
the
while
whose
are
the
feet
that
pass
me
echoing
on
unknown
ways
whose
are
the
lips
that
only
part
to
sing
through
all
my
days
not
yours
fond
youth
to
fill
mine
eager
eyes
or
find
that
shore
that
will
not
let
me
rest
nor
satisfies
for
evermore
beware
i
closed
my
hands
upon
a
moth
and
when
i
drew
my
palms
apart
instead
of
dusty
broken
wings
i
found
a
bleeding
human
heart
i
crushed
my
foot
upon
a
worm
that
had
my
garden
for
its
goal
but
when
i
drew
my
foot
aside
i
found
a
dying
human
soul
the
old
maid
she
walks
in
a
lonely
garden
on
the
path
her
feet
have
made
with
shoes
and
gown
of
a
flowered
brocade
the
hair
that
falls
on
her
shoulders
with
a
ribbon
tie
once
glowed
like
the
wheat
in
autumn
now
grey
as
a
winter
sky
time
on
her
brow
with
rough
fingers
writes
his
record
of
smiles
and
tears
and
her
mind
like
a
golden
timepiece
he
stopped
in
the
long
past
years
at
the
foot
of
the
lonely
garden
when
she
comes
to
the
trysting
place
she
knew
of
old
there
she
lingers
with
a
blush
on
her
withered
face
the
children
out
on
the
common
they
climb
to
the
garden
wall
and
laugh
will
come
who
never
will
come
at
all
and
often
over
our
sewing
as
i
and
my
neighbour
sit
to
gossip
over
this
story
that
has
never
an
end
to
it
is
dead
i
would
say
lover
who
left
her
so
long
ago
but
my
neighbour
would
rest
her
needle
to
answer
false
i
could
it
be
he
were
sleeping
with
a
love
that
was
such
as
this

burst
through
the
gates
of
silence
and
flown
to
meet
her
is
she
best
with
tears
or
laughter
this
dame
in
her
old
brocade
my
neighbour
says
she
is
holy
with
a
faith
that
will
not
fade
but
the
children
out
on
the
common
they
answer
her
dreary
call
and
say
will
come
who
never
will
come
at
all
wirastrua
wirastrua
wirastrua
woe
to
me
that
you
are
dead
the
corpse
has
spoken
from
out
his
bed
my
burning
brain
throbbed
and
beat
on
the
strings
of
pain
now
i
rest
all
my
done
in
the
world
behind
the
sun
yesterday
i
toiled
full
sore
i
ride
in
a
coach
and
four
yesternight
in
the
streets
i
lay
with
kings
and
as
good
as
wirastrua
wirastrua
would
i
were
lying
as
cold
as
you
questions
what
is
the
secret
of
your
life
browsing
ox
ox
the
sweet
grass
eating
who
strung
the
mighty
sinews
in
your
flesh
who
set
that
great
heart
beating
what
is
the
secret
of
your
death
soulless
ox
ox
so
patiently
waiting
why
hath
pain
wove
her
net
for
your
anguish
if
for
you
death
will
gain
no
creating
a
little
dog
a
little
dog
disturbed
my
trust
in
heaven
i
praised
most
faithfully
all
the
great
things
that
be
pain
and
pleasure
even
i
said
though
hard
this
weighing
of
pains
and
tears
and
praying
he
will
reward
most
just
i
said
your
bitter
weeping
man
or
maid
your
tears
or
laughter
shall
gain
a
just
hereafter
meet
you
the
will
of
god
then
unafraid
gird
you
to
your
trials
for
abode
is
open
for
all
sorrow
live
for
the
great
there
passed
me
on
the
road
a
little
dog
with
hungry
eyes
and
sad
thin
flesh
all
shivering
all
sore
and
quivering
whining
beneath
the
fell
disease
he
had
i
hurried
home
and
praised
god
as
before
for
thus
affording
to
man
rewarding
the
dog
was
whining
outside
my
door
i
flung
it
wide
and
said
come
enter
in
outcast
of
god
beneath
his
rod
you
suffer
sore
poor
beast
that
had
no
sin
not
at
my
door
then
must
you
cry
complaining
your
lot
unjust
but
his
who
thrust
you
from
his
door
your
body
maiming
not
mine
the
pleasure
that
you
bear
this
pain
hurled
into
being
without
hope
of
freeing
by
grief
and
patience
a
soul
for
any
gain
thus
i
reproached
god
while
i
tended
the
sores
to
healing
a
voice
stealing
and
whispering
out
of
the
beast
i
friended
said
had
quickened
my
flesh
bestowing
joys
without
measure
made
for
its
pleasure
an
garden
for
ever
glowing
gave
me
to
man
his
care
and
protection
to
gain
and
to
give
and
bid
us
so
live
in
united
bonds
of
help
and
affection
wrecked
our
garden
so
we
were
hurled
out
from
the
skies
of
paradise
into
the
sorrows
of
a
weeping
world
he
forgets
my
care
i
as
god
has
said
give
still
affection
for
that
connection
which
into
all
our
bodies
life
has
breathed
why
are
you
abusing
god
and
praising
with
mock
effacement
and
false
abasement
your
own
kindness
deeming
it
amazing
that
you
should
do
this
duty
for
my
sake
which
is
his
bidding
nor
blame
for
ridding
himself
of
me
your
neighbour
he
who
spake
hard
words
hard
words
and
drove
me
forth
all
sore
and
ill
thus
while
i
tended
this
dog
i
friended
gave
back
my
faith
in
heaven
by
will
prayed
so
i
prayed
so
eagerly
and
see
how
bitter
i
have
a
word
and
all
i
prayed
so
eagerly
i
prayed
so
not
to
be
you
turned
and
passed
fates
smile
for
me
dreamed
yet
i
prayed
eagerly
the
dark
when
the
dark
comes
this
the
end
i
pray
no
answer
from
the
night
and
then
once
more
the
day
i
take
the
world
again
upon
my
neck
and
go
pace
with
the
serious
hours
since
fate
will
have
it
so
begone
dead
man
unclasp
your
hands
from
round
my
heart
i
and
my
burden
pass
you
and
your
peace
depart
distant
voices
i
left
my
home
for
travelling
because
i
heard
the
strange
birds
sing
in
foreign
skies
and
felt
their
wing
brush
past
my
soul
impatiently
i
saw
the
bloom
on
flower
and
tree
that
only
grows
beyond
the
sea
methought
the
distant
voices
spake
more
wisdom
than
near
tongues
can
make
i
my
heart
should
break
and
what
is
past
is
past
and
done
i
dreamt
and
here
the
dream
begun
i
saw
a
salmon
in
the
sun
leap
from
the
river
to
the
ah
strange
mishap
so
wounded
sore
to
his
sweet
stream
to
turn
no
more
a
bird
from
his
breast
spread
his
weak
wings
in
vain
request
never
again
to
reach
his
nest
i
saw
a
blossom
bloom
too
soon
upon
a
afternoon
breathe
no
more
beneath
the
moon
i
woke
warmed
a
foreign
sky
where
locust
blossoms
bud
and
die
strange
birds
called
to
me
flashing
by
and
dusky
faces
passed
and
woke
the
echoes
with
the
words
they
same
old
tales
as
other
folk
a
truce
to
roaming
never
more
leave
the
home
i
loved
of
yore
but
strangers
meet
me
at
the
door
i
left
my
home
still
travelling
for
yet
i
hear
the
strange
birds
sing
and
foreign
flowers
rare
perfumes
bring
i
hear
a
distant
voice
more
wise
than
others
are
foreign
skies
in
paradise
the
ballad
of
the
fairy
this
is
an
evil
night
to
go
my
sister
to
the
across
the
fairy
rath
will
you
not
wait
till
hallow
eve
is
over
for
many
are
the
dangers
in
your
path
i
may
not
wait
till
hallow
eve
is
over
i
shall
be
there
before
the
night
is
fled
for
brother
i
am
weary
for
my
lover
and
i
must
see
him
once
alive
or
dead
prayed
to
heaven
but
it
would
not
listen
call
thrice
in
the
name
be
it
a
live
man
that
shall
come
to
hear
me
or
but
a
corpse
all
clad
in
snowy
white
she
had
drawn
on
her
silken
hose
and
garter
her
crimson
petticoat
was
kilted
high
she
trod
her
way
amid
the
bog
and
brambles
until
the
she
stood
when
first
she
cried
the
name
so
loudly
she
listened
but
she
heard
no
sound
at
all
when
twice
she
cried
she
thought
from
out
the
darkness
she
heard
the
echo
of
a
light
footfall
when
last
she
cried
her
voice
came
in
a
whisper
she
trembled
in
her
loneliness
and
fright
before
her
stood
a
shrouded
mighty
figure
in
sombre
garments
blacker
than
the
night
if
you
be
my
own
true
love
she
questioned
fear
you
speak
you
quickly
unto

own

answered

without
a
grave
upon
the

stairs
of
death

for
a
place
to
rest

eternal
tossing
of
the
make
my
love

bed

wide
and
hollow

grave
wherein
we
both

his
body

and

it
from
the
dangers
of
the

and

and

heart

my
love

i
pray
my
pony

me
on
his
young
soul
what
will

night
and

and

you
but

my
soul
to

back
his
all
woefully
she
wept
and
stepping
homeward
bemoaned
aloud
her
dark
and
cruel
fate
come
she
cried
little
dog
to
meet
me
and
you
my
horse
be
browsing
at
the
right
hastily
she
pushed
by
bush
and
bramble
chased
by
a
fear
that
made
her
footsteps
fleet
and
as
she
ran
she
met
her
little
brother
then
her
old
father
coming
her
to
meet
brother
little
brother
cried
she
weeping
you
said
of
beware
for
precious
things
are
bought
and
sold
ere
on
by
those
who
barter
she
went
alone
into
the
little
chapel
and
knelt
before
the
holy
shrine
saying
mary
pray
you
for
me
to
save
those
two
most
gentle
souls
of
and
as
she
prayed
behold
the
holy
statue
spoke
to
her
saying
can
i
aid
ways
are
just
and
you
have
dared
to
question
his
judgment
on
this
soul
you
that
one
soul
your
father
and
your
brother
your
own
immortal
life
you
bartered
then
yet
one
chance
is
sure
repentance
give
back
his
heart
you
made
to
live
these
two
father
and
my
i
give
his
heart
back
into
cold
land
never
again
to
warm
his
dead
sweet
body
or
beat
to
madness
underneath
my
for
your
save
it
from
its
sorrow
you
must
drive
back
his
soul
into
the
night
back
into
righteous
punishment
and
justice
or
lose
your
chance
of
everlasting
never
shall
i
drive
him
back
to
anguish
my
soul
shall
suffer
letting
his
go
she
rose
and
weeping
left
the
little
chapel
went
forward
blindly
till
she
reached
the
sea
she
dug
a
grave
within
the
surf
and
shingle
a
dark
cold
bed
made
very
deep
and
wide
she
laid
her
down
all
stiff
and
stretched
for
burial
right
in
the
pathway
of
the
rising
tide
first
tossed
into
her
waiting
arms
the
restless
loud
waves
a
woman
very
grey
and
cold
within
her
bed
she
stood
upright
so
quickly
and
loosed
her
fingers
from
the
dead
hold
the
second
who
upon
her
heart
had
rested
from
out
the
storm
a
baby
chill
and
stark
with
one
long
sob
she
drew
it
on
her
bosom
then
thrust
it
out
again
into
the
dark
the
last
who
came
so
slow
was
her
own
lover
she
kissed
his
icy
face
on
cheek
and
chin
cold
shall
be
your
house
beloved
o
cold
the
bed
that
we
must
sleep
within
heavy
heavy
on
our
lips
so
faithful
and
on
our
hearts
shall
lie
our
own
and
as
she
spoke
the
bitter
tears
were
falling
on
his
still
face
all
salter
than
the
sea
oh
she
said
for
a
little
moment
you
knew
my
cold
dead
love
that
i
was
by
that
my
soul
goes
into
the
utter
darkness
when
yours
comes
mine
goes
in
to
and
as
she
wept
she
kissed
his
frozen
forehead
laid
her
warm
lips
upon
his
mouth
so
chill
with
no
then
the
waters
flowing
into
their
grave
grew
heavy
deep
and
still
and
so
said
if
to
that
fairy
you
dare
to
go
you
see
her
ghost
so
lone
she
prays
for
love
of
her
that
you
will
aid
her
and
give
your
soul
to
buy
her
back
her
own
the
grave
this
is
the
scene
of
a
despair
and
a
release
from
the
difficult
traits
of
the
flesh
so
it
seeking
peace
a
shot
rang
out
in
the
night
doors
were
wide
and
you
stood
alone
a
stranger
and
saw
inside
coward
flesh
brave
soul
which
was
it
one
feared
the
world
the
pity
of
men
or
their
scorn
yet
carelessly
hurled
all
on
the
balance
of
chance
for
a
state
unknown
fled
the
laughter
of
men
for
the
anger
of
perhaps
when
the
hot
blood
streamed
on
the
daisied
sod
poor
soul
you
were
likened
to
cain
and
you
fled
from
god
men
say
you
fought
hard
for
your
life
when
the
deed
was
done
but
your
body
would
rise
no
more
this
sun
i
do
the
a
night
as
this
when
the
sea
throws
up
white
arms
for
the
wild
kiss
when
the
waves
shake
the
shuddering
shore
with
their
foamy
jaws
tear
the
strand
till
slipping
pebbles
shriek
through
their
claws
the
sky
is
loud
with
the
storm
not
a
bird
dare
span
from
here
to
the
mist
beasts
are
silent
yet
for
a
man
for
a
soul
springing
naked
to
meet
its
judge
a
night
that
were
as
a
brother
to
this
poor
long
flight
but
he
had
chosen
they
tell
me
a
dusk
so
fair
one
almost
thought
there
were
not
such
the
air
was
full
of
the
perfume
of
pines
and
the
sweet
sleepy
chirp
of
birds
long
the
lush
soft
grass
at
his
feet
they
say
there
was
dancing
too
in
a
house
close
by
that
they
heard
the
shot
just
thinking
wild
birds
must
die
they
supped
and
laughed
went
singing
the
long
night
through
and
they
danced
unknowing
the
dance
of
death
with
you
what
did
you
hear
when
you
opened
the
doors
of
death
was
it
the
sob
of
a
thrush
or
a
slow
sweet
breath
of
the
perfumed
air
that
blew
through
the
doors
with
you
that
you
fought
so
hard
to
regain
the
world
you
knew
or
was
it
a
cry
that
shrieking
into
the
gloom
like
a
hand
that
closed
on
your
soul
clutching
it
from
its
doom
was
it
a
call
or
the
touch
of
a
kiss
that
followed
your
desperate
soul
down
the
black
abyss
what
did
you
you
stood
on
the
other
a
strange
shy
soul
amongst
souls
did
you
seek
to
hide
from
the
ghosts
that
were
who
judged
you
upon
your
way
reckoned
your
sins
against
theirs
for
the
judgment
day
you
feared
the
world
the
pity
of
men
or
their
scorn
the
movements
of
fate
and
the
sorrows
for
which
you
were
born
laughter
speech
their
judging
what
was
it
to
this
where
the
eyes
of
the
dead
proclaim
you
have
done
amiss
not
peace
did
you
gain
perhaps
nor
the
rest
you
had
planned
the
horrible
countless
eyes
that
you
could
not
withstand
or
was
it
god
looked
from
his
throne
in
a
disdain
and
you
shrieked
for
a
trial
once
more
in
the
height
of
your
pain
who
you
struggled
so
hard
for
breath
you
saw
nothing
passing
the
grave
except
silence
and
death
you
lay
shut
in
by
the
four
clay
walls
of
your
cell
there
the
live
soul
locked
up
in
the
stiff
dead
shell
dead
dead
and
buried
beneath
the
clay
and
still
the
living
soul
caged
in
to
wait
decay
for
ever
alone
in
night
of
unlifting
gloom
there
to
think
and
think
and
think
in
the
silent
tomb
or
was
it
in
cold
land
there
was
no
perfume
of
the
scented
flowers
or
lilt
of
a
gay
tune
no
sea
there
or
no
cool
of
a
fresh
breath
no
woods
no
plains
no
dreams
and
alas
no
death
was
there
no
life
there
that
brain
could
understand
no
past
no
future
hopes
to
come
in
that
strange
land
no
human
love
no
sleep
no
day
no
night
but
ever
eternal
living
in
eternal
light
perhaps
the
soul
thus
springing
to
fill
its
grave
found
all
the
peace
and
happiness
that
it
could
crave
all
it
had
lost
alone
was
that
poor
part
which
naught
but
grey
corruption
saw
for
its
chart
ah
well
for
us
there
ended
all
one
life
with
a
shot
a
cry
a
struggle
and
a
fainting
kiss
blood
let
the
all
a
world
was
lost
and
no
one
may
ever
know
how
he
paid
the
cost
he
is
lost
in
the
crowd
of
the
dead
in
the
of
death
a
name
on
a
stone
left
to
tell
that
he
ever
drew
breath
so
desperate
body
die
there
with
your
long
release
and
unhappy
spirit
god
grant
you
peace
