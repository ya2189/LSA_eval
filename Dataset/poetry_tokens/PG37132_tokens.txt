i

of
all
the

that
are
sleeping
in

there
are
babies
in

high
lands
and
babies
in

there
are
pale
ones
wrapped
in
furry
skins
on
the
margin
of
the
snow
and
brown
ones
naked
in
the
isles
where
all
the
spices
grow
and
some
are
in
the
palace
on
a
white
and
downy
bed
and
some
are
in
the
garret
with
a
clout
beneath
their
head
and
some
are
on
the
cold
hard
earth
whose
mothers
have
no
bread
o
little
men
and
women
dear
flowers
yet
unblown
o
little
kings
and
beggars
of
the
pageant
yet
unshown
sleep
soft
and
dream
pale
dreams
now
is
your
own
though
some
shall
walk
in
darkness
and
others
in
the
light
though
some
shall
smile
and
others
weep
in
the
silence
of
the
night
when
life
has
touched
with
many
hues
your
souls
now
clear
and
white
god
save
you
little
children
and
make
your
eyes
to
see
his
finger
pointing
in
the
dark
whatever
you
may
be
till
one
and
all
through
life
and
death
pass
to
eternity
to
raoul
bouchard
dear
were
your
kisses
baby
boy
your
weight
upon
my
arm
gay
were
your
tuneful
cries
of
joy
as
i
danced
you
round
the
farm
and
sweet
your
softness
when
we
lay
laughing
and
cooing
in
the
hay
the
summer
sun
will
shine
again
old
arms
will
mow
and
reap
there
be
new
flowers
on
the
plain
new
lambs
among
the
sheep
but
never
in
this
world
of
men
shall
we
two
be
as
we
were
then
your
feet
have
touched
the
ground
my
bird
and
now
your
wondering
eyes
will
gaze
no
more
as
if
they
heard
a
seraph
in
the
skies
a
little
boy
with
leap
and
shout
you
wildly
chase
your
dreams
about
but
when
you
are
a
man
soft
thing
and
life
has
made
you
stern
may
we
who
watched
you
in
your
spring
still
feel
our
babe
return
in
hallowed
moments
such
as
shine
when
thought
or
deed
makes
man
divine
and
little
hands
what
will
you
grasp
when
you
leave
this
nest
o

you
clasp

breast
o

in

diving
deep
are
you
never

on

wing
lambs
o
little
lambs
the
month
is
cold
the
sky
is
very
gray
you
shiver
in
the
misty
grass
and
bleat
at
all
the
winds
that
pass
wait
when
i
big
some
day
i
build
a
roof
to
every
fold
but
now
that
i
am
small
i
pray
at
mother
knee
for
you
perhaps
the
angels
with
their
wings
will
come
and
warm
you
little
things
i
sure
that
if
god
knew
he
let
the
lambs
be
born
in
may
the
robin
when
father
takes
his
spade
to
dig
then
robin
comes
along
he
sits
upon
a
little
twig
and
sings
a
little
song
or
if
the
trees
are
rather
far
he
does
not
stay
alone
but
comes
up
close
to
where
we
are
and
bobs
upon
a
stone
the
mouse
little
master
mouse
you
better
leave
this
house
crumbs
are
scarce
upon
the
floor
and
pussy
sleeps
behind
the
door
mousie
soft
and
grey
i
wish
you
run
away
cook
will
catch
you
in
a
trap
and
mice
may
sit
in
mother
lap
the
bat

that
flies
at
night
when
angels
breath
has
blown
the
light
when
all
the
bees
are
hived
in
bed
and
swallow
sleeps
with
hidden
head
songless
bird
until
this
hour
among
the
bells
in
the
ivied
tower
have
you
hung
dreaming
in
your
house
are
you
a
living
wing√®d
mouse
bat
bat
i
often
doubt
and
when
i
see
you
flit
about
i
wonder
if
the
dead
birds
roam
in
circles
round
their
nestlings
home
the
swallow
o
swallow
if
i
had
your
wings
i
would
not
stay
below
i
leave
off
catching
flies
and
things
and
up
to
heaven
i
go
i
sail
above
the
tallest
tree
that
waves
its
arms
on
high
beyond
the
furthest
cloud
we
see
and
deeper
than
the
sky
perhaps
when
live
birds
find
the
way
they
all
sent
down
again
and
that
is
why
you
dive
for
insects
in
the
rain
snowdrops
little
ladies
white
and
green
with
your
spears
about
you
will
you
tell
us
where
you
been
since
we
lived
without
you
you
are
sweet
and
fresh
and
clean
with
your
pearly
faces
in
the
dark
earth
where
you
been
there
are
wondrous
places
yet
you
come
again
serene
when
the
leaves
are
hidden
bringing
joy
from
where
you
been
you
return
unbidden
little
ladies
white
and
green
are
you
glad
to
cheer
us
hunger
not
for
where
you
been
stay
till
spring
be
near
us
frost
the
flowers
in
the
garden
are
very
cold
at
night
when
i
look
out
of
window
their
beds
are
hard
and
white
the
primrose
and
the
scilla
the
merry
crocus
too
o
jane
if
we
were
flowers
what
should
we
children
do
we
have
to
sleep
all
naked
beneath
the
windy
trees
yet
we
should
die
i
know
it
with
even
a
chemise
apples
red
cheeks
red
cheeks
will
you
play
with
me
no
boy
pale
boy
i
want
to
climb
that
tree

red
cheeks
you
will
tumble
down
no

pale

i
eat
the
apples
brown
red
cheeks
red
cheeks
barns
are
best
for

no
boy
pale
boy
i
soon
be
down
again
lonely
children
i
the
trees
are
dusty
in
the
park
the
grass
is
hard
and
brown
i
glad
i
got
a
noah
ark
but
i
sorry
i
in
town
a
lot
of
little
girls
and
boys
are
not
so
rich
as
me
but
o
i
give
them
all
my
toys
for
shells
beside
the
sea
ii
the
flowers
are
happy
in
the
garden
for
the
bees
are
always
there
the
clouds
are
happy
up
in
heaven
with
the
angels
in
the
air
but
little
boy
and
little
mouse
are
rather
lonely
in
the
house
playgrounds
in
summer
i
am
very
glad
we
children
are
so
small
for
we
can
see
a
thousand
things
that
men
ca
see
at
all
they
do
know
much
about
the
moss
and
all
the
stones
they
pass
they
never
lie
and
play
among
the
forests
in
the
grass
they
walk
about
a
long
way
off
and
when
we
at
the
sea
let
father
stoop
as
best
he
can
he
ca
find
things
like
me
but
when
the
snow
is
on
the
ground
and
all
the
puddles
freeze
i
wish
that
i
were
very
tall
high
up
above
the
trees
fairings
o
father
has
donned
his
suit
of
brown
and
saddled
the
gelding
gray
and
he
ridden
off
to
london
town
where
the
streets
are
fine
and
gay
and
mother
has
asked
for
a
yard
of
lace
and
kate
for
a
kerchief
new
and
moll
for
a
mirror
to
look
at
her
face
and
bessie
for
beads
all
blue
and
dick
has
been
promised
a
kite
so
tall
and
jamie
a
leathern
whip
and
baby
shall
play
with
a
painted
ball
and
o
i
have
asked
for
a
ship
but
our
eldest
sister
stood
apart
and
i
think
i
heard
her
say
bring
me
back
a
little
white
heart
like
the
one
i
lost
in
may
the
flower
to
the
bud
tiny
heart
beneath
my
hand
say
what
treasures
will
you
hold
o
what
blossom
will
unfold
late
to
bloom
or
soon
to
fade
from
this
bud
my
through
what
shallows
will
you
wade
to
what
heights
will
you
aspire
in
your
spirit
white
desire
will
you
mar
or
will
you
make
will
you
give
or
will
you
take
will
you
glow
or
will
you
break
with
the
running
of
the
sand
tiny
heart
beneath
my
hand
six
songs
of
girlhood
love
and
the
maidens
he
seemed
asleep
his
wings
were
wet
with
dew
he
lay
among
the
flowers
sweeter
than
spring
his
radiant
curls
with
primrose
and
with
violet
were
crowned
and
in
a
silent
ring
the
girls
watched
all
an
april
morning
misty
hours
not
one
dared
wake
him
yet
each
breast
yearned
to
be
pillow
to
a
thing
so
fair
will
he
smile
thought
they
waking
but
between
them
pressed
one
who
with
laughter
bore
the
rogue
away
ere
they
had
touched
a
feather
of
his
wing
awakenings
the
first
time
she
awoke
her
room
was
filled
with
light
thought
she
they
made
a
little
fire
to
warm
me
through
the
night
the
next
time
she
awoke
sweet
music
stirred
the
air
thought
she
they
brought
a
magic
lyre
to
make
my
dreams
more
fair
the
third
time
she
awoke
the
sky
was
gray
thought
she
i
know
my
heart
desire
will
come
to
me
but
empty
was
the
street
and
ashen
was
the
hearth
and
the
nimble
feet
were
speeding
the
earth
the
clouded
soul
o
what
have
you
done
with
your
heart
daughter
and
what
have
you
done
to
your
soul
my
dear
your
heart
was
like
a
lily
in
june
and
your
soul
as
a
crystal
clear
o
i
thrown
my
heart
in
a
well
mother
for
the
lily
was
sick
and
needed
rain
o
i
wept
a
cloud
round
my
soul
mother
and
we
never
shall
see
it
again
the
healer
o
will
you
have
my
heart
sweet
maid
my
heart
so
true
my
heart
so
red
o
will
you
have
my
heart
dear
maid
and
give
me
yours
instead
o
keep
your
heart
my
good
young
man
for
mine
is
wounded
deep
and
sore
o
keep
your
heart
my
kind
young
man
for
mine
shall
love
no
more
the
open
door
why
have
you
locked
the
door
my
maid
why
have
you
locked
the
door
o
i
have
let
grief
out
she
said
never
to
enter
more
open
and
set
it
wide
my
maid
open
and
set
it
wide
lest
joy
should
come
one
day
he
said
and
have
to
stand
outside
the
fugitive
when
she
returned
to
the
clouded
land
she
held
sweet
flowers
in
her
hand
her
eyes
were
bright
with
a
beaming
light
that
none
could
understand
said
they
where
sister
hast
thou
been
what
hidden
glory
hast
thou
seen
what
magic
sod
has
thy
white
foot
trod
what
groves
of
green
said
she
i
followed
across
the
plain
to
the
gates
of
love
to
the
gates
of
pain
by
one
by
two
all
the
rest
went
through
but
i
came
back
again
the
faithful
wife
the
faithful
wife
it
was
a
banished
chieftain
returned
from
oversea
and
he
saw
his
wife
and
children
come
smiling
the
lea
the
moon
had
wrapped
them
in
her
beams
the
wind
was
in
their
hair
their
feet
that
trod
the
wild
bluebell
were
light
as
wings
on
air
have
you
come
to
meet
me
wife
as
you
once
did
swear
to
do
full
seven
years
have
i
been
gone
and
was
your
word
so
true
he
took
her
by
the
white
cool
hand
where
the
golden
rings
shone
gay
he
took
her
youngest
on
his
arm
and
joyful
led
the
way
fair
are
ye
my
father
towers
and
sweet
my
garden
dear
god
grant
i
never
leave
you
more
till
death
me
here
the
lights
were
burning
in
the
hall
as
they
sat
them
down
to
meat
the
pipers
piped
a
merry
tune
the
while
their
lord
did
eat
he
looked
to
right
he
looked
to
left
and
a
happy
man
was
he
as
he
stroked
the
head
of
the
good
that
stood
beside
his
knee
i
am
weary
wife
my
wife
and
the
flames
begin
to
pale
lead
on
for
i
would
sleep
awhile
before
i
tell
my
tale
she
lifted
the
bright
curtain
that
led
into
her
bower
there
came
the
tramp
of
parting
feet
and
silence
held
the
tower
wife
how
long
have
i
been
gone
the
room
smells
of
roses
still
o
wife
our
babes
are
very
young
their
limbs
are
cold
and
chill
she
folded
up
their
raiment
small
she
smiled
but
said
no
word
she
laid
her
children
in
one
bed
then
came
beside
her
lord
he
could
not
sleep
he
could
not
wake
but
lay
in
silence
there
his
dear
wife
held
him
by
the
hand
he
felt
her
hair
mother
mother
whispered
one
must
we
sleep
so
soon
the
sun
is
hidden
down
below
i
still
can
see
the
moon
quiet
be
quiet
my
little
child
and
watch
the
moonbeams
creep
you
may
not
play
about
for
your
father
lies
asleep
mother
mother
whispered
one
is
not
time
for
bed
where
have
you
put
my
little
lid
i
can
not
hide
my
head
still
lie
still
my
tiny
child
your
father
dear
is
found
we
four
shall
never
sleep
again
in
the
dark
and
heavy
mound
mother
mother
whispered
one
shall
that
ever
be
we
may
not
bide
in
the
light
of
day
to
watch
upon
the
lea
need
no
need
my
pretty
child
for
your
father
dear
has
come
we
kiss
him
once
we
kiss
him
twice
then
seek
our
own
far
home
he
heard
them
laugh
with
baby
joy
he
felt
their
kisses
sweet
he
heard
the
patter
to
the
door
of
their
unearthly
feet
he
could
not
stir
when
she
bent
low
to
kiss
him
on
the
lips
he
could
not
raise
to
hold
her
fast
his
anguished
but
his
heart
against
her
silent
breast
beat
loud
in
wild
despair
he
heard
the
swaying
of
her
skirt
and
his
soul
leapt
forth
in
a
shepherd
rose
to
call
his
sheep
when
the
morning
sky
was
gray
the
owl
flew
back
to
the
ruined
tower
he
led
his
flock
that
way
and
lo
amid
the
scattered
stones
that
the
foe
had
strewn
around
he
saw
his
chieftain
lie
a
corpse
upon
the
ground
a
smile
was
on
his
breathless
lips
and
he
lay
on
the
flowered
sward
where
his
wife
and
babes
had
bled
to
death
beneath
a
traitor
sword
womanhood
a
woman
to
her
poet
in
three
worlds
king
art
thou
of
my
desire
o
thou
of
many
crowns
whose
brow
with
light
wears
wisdom
diadem
thou
lyre
of
the
speechless
soul
in
silence
my
love
proud
empire
smiles
to
know
thee
king
and
in
the
realms
of
womanhood
i
wind
a
coronet
of
faith
a
ring
with
azure
chain
of
sapphire
intertwined
and
where
the
mind
pure
kingdom
is
i
seek
bright
crystals
pearls
of
truth
divine
and
rare
to
honour
thee
but
on
the
a√´rial
peak
that
marks
the
soul
eternal
region
there
thou
thronest
monarch
of
a
world
serene
crowned
with
the
emerald
unfathomed
green
the
infidel
my
soul
at
times
outworn
by
length
of
woe
a
strange
appeasement
seeks
in
doubting
thee
and
cries
my
sacred
mount
a
thing
as
low
as
any
hillock
shallow
rolls
the
sea
that
should
have
quenched
my
deep
unbounded
thirst
my
star
a
lamp
that
flickers
earthly
light
mere
glass
my
emerald
why
burst
o
heart
for
love
of
these
then
fullest
night
environs
me
thou
banished
stretching
wide
my
arms
i
grope
for
refuge
all
my
pain
cries
for
a
breast
whereon
to
hide
and
on
to
thine
i
fling
myself
again
thus
fools
impatient
of
god
silence
cry
there
is
no
god
and
seek
what
they
deny
love
within
vows
we
love
and
o
we
know
it
yet
love
name
upon
our
lips
a
tremulous
wish
must
die
we
both
were
made
for
loving
you
and
i
and
still
was
love
denied
to
both
it
came
more
fleeting
than
the
beauty
of
a
flame
now
each
within
the
other
hungering
eye
beholds
the
corse
of
joy
embalm√®d
lie
and
smiles
to
know
his
penury
the
same
there
is
no
sorrow
in
this
love
o
friend
from
ruin
tho
our
lips
be
sealed
by
silence
and
the
world
hard
fetter
dear
to
me
your
being
yet
we
know
nor
fear
of
loss
nor
of
possession
here
a
shield
shall
part
us
nobly
faithful
to
the
end
the
exile
you
too
mistook
me
for
no
man
is
wise
whom
love
enclouds
nor
nor
keen
your
vision
else
there
never
would
have
been
a
cause
for
parting
your
eyes
failed
in
my
love
love
self
to
recognise
you
saw
its
outer
garment
where
the
green
of
perfect
faith
was
marred
by
passion
sheen
by
outworn
patience
and
desire
disguise
had
you
but
read
me
to
the
inner
soul
you
would
have
held
me
fast
i
can
forego
all
that
is
sought
of
hand
and
lip
the
whole
of
love
poor
joy
but
i
have
need
to
know
that
when
the
heart
fails
i
may
come
and
rest
my
head
upon
your
wide
and
sheltering
breast
the
scar
indelible
o
your
voice
your
voice
in
the
night
how
shall
i
wipe
your
voice
from
the
night
only
hope
could
wipe
it
away
and
you
have
driven
hope
away
o
your
eyes
your
eyes
in
my
sight
how
shall
i
hide
your
eyes
from
my
sight
only
joy
could
hide
them
away
and
you
have
driven
joy
away
o
your
name
your
name
in
the
light
how
shall
i
thrust
your
name
from
the
light
only
love
could
thrust
it
away
and
you
have
driven
love
away
revulsion
my
heart
is
weary
of
love
and
hate
too
sick
of
its
love
to
love
you
still
too
sick
of
its
hate
to
hate
you
yet
my
heart
is
weary
and
would
forget
o
give
me
nothing
is
far
too
late
your
much
were
little
my
thirst
to
fill
your
little
were
scorn
of
faith
so
deep
o
give
me
nothing
and
let
me
sleep
the
captive
i
want
to
take
my
heart
away
break
it
away
from
the
branch
where
it
clings
i
want
to
quit
the
barren
spray
where
now
no
throstle
sings
the
butterflies
have
long
since
gone
gone
to
the
bough
where
the
gay
blossoms
are
the
sinking
sun
now
bears
the
dawn
to
other
lands
afar
i
want
to
break
my
heart
away
tear
it
away
from
the
bough
where
it
grows
o
for
the
light
of
a
free
new
day
on
the
hill
beyond
the
snows
possession
anguish
one
tree
in
my
garden
one
tree
out
of
all
the
forests
of
the
world
one
little
ship
afloat
upon
the
sea
one
shell
beneath
the
waves
flawless
and
pearled
one
rose
on
my
bower
one
rose
for
a
day
to
scatter
on
the
grass
one
shifting
star
agleam
where
the
wind
blows
one
gem
upheld
that
all
may
share
who
pass
one
heart
to
be
ached
for
one
heart
out
of
all
the
bosoms
that
are
here
one
fragile
hope
alive
the
starver
part
one
joy
already
faint
and
pale
with
fear
one
flame
in
the
darkness
one
flame
for
the
night
to
sever
with
a
breath
one
poor
faith
fettered
to
a
mortal
name
and
over
all
the
beating
wings
of
death
treasures
of
poverty
i
sometimes
watch
the
lips
of
other
women
and
think
of
all
the
kisses
they
have
known
i
sometimes
touch
the
hands
of
other
women
in
wonder
at
the
memoried
palms
they
own
the
kiss
upon
my
brow
was
sadly
given
the
hands
i
held
but
once
were
not
my
own
and
yet
i
would
not
change
what
i
was
given
for
all
the
kisses
i
have
never
known
nor
would
i
change
again
my
heart
white
desert
o
wondrous
are
the
meetings
i
have
known
and
strange
the
eyes
that
seek
me
in
the
desert
then
smiling
vanish
to
rejoin
their
own
solitude
now
empty
lies
the
house
the
languid
air
unstirred
by
voices
creeps
from
room
to
room
no
footstep
falls
upon
the
silent
stair
all
still
and
dark
in
every
nook
the
tomb
of
some
thought
lies
remembrance
everywhere
lingers
to
seek
a
joy
no
longer
there
and
as
i
sit
here
lonely
in
the
gloom
i
ask
myself
which
evil
i
would
choose
never
to
have
or
else
to
have
and
lose
the
heart
asleep
within
me
now
my
heart
asleep
and
none
shall
wake
it
more
the
silence
of
all
pain
is
deep
within
me
now
my
heart
asleep
it
dreams
of
joys
it
might
not
keep
and
nothing
looks
before
within
me
now
my
heart
asleep
and
none
shall
wake
it
more
adversity
black
winds
of
the
world
there
is
pity
in
your
breath
against
wild
tempest
weaponing
grey
clouds
of
the
sky
you
are
gentle
in
your
shade
against
tempering
red
wounds
of
the
heart
there
is
mercy
in
your
blood
against
hardening
pale
swoons
of
the
soul
you
are
tender
in
your
pangs
against
dire
death
emboldening
faces
of
the
dead
i
dreamed
that
wandering
by
a
river
bank
i
came
across
a
lonely
ship
that
sank
in
lifeless
waters
day
was
dim
in
dreams
we
see
nor
sun
nor
moon
unearthly
gleams
of
deadened
light
fall
strangely
from
the
there
were
but
three
that
struggled
not
to
die
a
man
a
woman
and
a
tender
child
he
sought
to
save
them
both
with
effort
wild
and
dragged
his
love
to
the
entangled
shore
but
down
the
slimy
weeds
she
slid
once
more
into
the
water
and
her
lover
breast
received
her
and
together
they
found
rest
the
child
was
saved
my
hand
towards
her
hand
outstretched
drew
all
her
sweetness
to
the
land
where
naked
like
a
lily
wet
with
rain
she
sank
and
loudly
wept
at
her
life
gain
quite
small
she
was
and
light
i
bore
her
fast
to
what
seemed
home
and
there
she
smiled
at
last
and
sat
upright
within
my
arms
i
found
a
veil
wherein
to
wrap
her
round
tissues
that
far
in
were
spun
by
those
who
love
the
flowers
and
the
sun
i
laid
her
softly
in
a
silken
bed
strewed
fragrant
violets
about
her
head
and
left
her
was
my
dream
then
that
i
slept
but
when
at
dawn
unto
her
bed
i
crept
the
child
was
lost
her
pillow
was
all
wet
with
tears
that
still
flowed
on
and
faster
yet
they
flowed
in
quickening
rills
until
i
thought
i
stood
beside
a
torrent
wide
that
sought
an
unknown
sea
the
day
was
sad
tho
young
upon
a
misty
branch
some
bird
had
sung
and
left
a
trembling
silence
all
around
i
saw
the
little
daisies
on
the
ground
fast
closed
with
folded
in
vain
shielding
their
yellow
hearts
from
the
cold
rain
a
voice
invisible
made
murmur
then
here
and
look
upon
these
poor
drowned
men
the
ship
was
sunk
a
year
ago
but
i
stepped
back
and
shuddering
turned
away
for
i
had
never
seen
the
face
of
death
yet
fear
itself
soon
drew
me
with
quick
breath
back
to
the
place
even
to
the
river
brink
where
i
had
seen
that
lonely
vessel
sink
and
there
in
waters
deep
i
saw
them
lie
with
hands
at
rest
and
eyes
that
sought
the
sky
clear
eyes
wide
open
to
an
unseen
day
in
wondrous
silence
motionless
they
lay
with
white
lips
smiling
on
their
spirit
bliss
death
but
this
i
cried
more
but
this
and
answer
came
those
faces
there
are
all
unknown
was
then
i
saw
him
fair
with
perfect
peace
my
enemy
even
he
of
all
the
world
who
most
had
tortured
me
he
lay
there
blessed
among
the
blessed
and
smiled
with
eyes
more
pure
than
any
wakening
child
the
little
waves
in
passing
like
the
breeze
that
stirs
the
foliage
of
the
unmoved
trees
played
in
their
hair
and
fluttering
grasses
rose
and
fell
and
danced
about
their
mute
repose
but
i
gazed
on
until
i
too
had
drunk
of
their
lips
joy
until
their
peace
had
sunk
into
my
troubling
heart
that
ached
to
join
them
and
then
waked
the
sleeper
there
lay
a
man
on
clovered
ground
whose
life
was
death
he
slept
so
sound
a
child
bent
low
to
watch
his
eyes
he
smiling
waked
and
saw
the
skies
i
know
a
soul
now
fast
asleep
whose
dreams
are
sad
i
hear
him
weep
i
bend
and
gaze
for
pity
sake
but
all
in
vain
he
will
not
wake
stars
o
kings
and
queens
that
in
my
happy
heart
as
in
a
royal
chapel
warm
and
white
ensanctuaried
are
i
come
beneath
the
moonless
sky
this
radiant
chart
of
the
unfathomable
heavens
where
dart
stars
with
lamp
of
love
alight
unto
your
images
my
reverent
sight
enfolds
you
and
i
bring
you
each
your
part
of
piety
the
will
that
guides
each
star
gave
jewels
to
my
hands
i
might
not
hold
whose
grace
remembered
fills
my
palm
so
rest
o
your
kingdoms
are
afar
yet
here
i
own
you
shrined
in
pearls
and
gold
the
sovereign
captives
of
my
loyal
breast
trelawny
grave
i
know
a
garden
near
the
gates
of
rome
where
life
and
death
hold
hands
in
silence
here
in
solemn
shade
where
towering
cypress
rear
their
green
eternal
white
as
foam
lie
scattered
stones
that
shield
the
final
home
of
exiles
fair
their
bed
by
violets
dear
and
swaying
roses
decked
above
them
clear
in
bluest
glory
arches
heaven
dome
was
here
my
heart
encountered
peace
one
day
beside
an
old
man
grave
that
said
if
god
condemn
you
live
beyond
your
friend
this
way
you
too
may
the
heart
is
childish
dread
of
fades
before
trelawny
dead
to
his
shelley
in
the
sod
january
as
in
a
house
where
death
has
trodden
all
the
little
children
stand
before
a
silent
door
with
quickened
breath
holding
each
other
tightly
by
the
hand
so
we
o
mother
at
the
keyless
door
stand
gathered
with
nameless
fears
a
strength
has
left
the
hour
the
world
before
was
warmer
and
we
face
the
day
with
tears
lines
on
a
picture
by
mary
gow
o
whirling
world
i
know
a
corner
still
unsoiled
by
hate
and
strife
where
hushed
and
gentle
is
the
voice
of
life
where
time
a
summer
rill
through
the
grass
in
measure
slow
sings
sweetly
as
we
go
here
is
a
room
wherein
the
white
day
gleams
silence
peace
has
spread
her
pearly
wings
a
smiling
woman
reads
of
simple
things
a
child
blue
eyes
are
blinded
by
their
dreams
to
serenity
before
a
madonna
by
botticelli
thine
is
the
face
our
driven
souls
shall
wear
o
sweet
serenity
no
earthly
wind
can
rend
thine
azure
mantle
now
nor
tear
those
veils
that
shield
the
radiant
locks
they
bind
thy
brow
is
calm
with
storm
appeased
thy
lids
are
heavy
with
the
wisdom
of
all
tears
thy
mouth
is
strong
with
silence
that
forbids
weary
lament
and
craven
wail
of
fears
within
thy
guarded
bosom
now
no
fire
is
ardent
thou
hast
hidden
all
thy
scars
we
too
may
tread
the
ashes
of
desire
and
wing
our
spirits
thus
to
touch
the
stars
eleven
sonnets
i
i
will
not
close
the
door
o
love
on
thee
although
i
fear
thee
still
in
days
of
old
thy
magic
echoes
lured
me
on
to
be
the
slave
of
dreams
but
now
that
i
behold
the
earth
again
and
that
my
wings
are
gone
i
will
take
refuge
simply
on
thy
breast
no
miracle
i
seek
no
rapturous
dawn
of
an
unearthly
day
i
will
but
rest
my
weary
eyes
and
lay
between
thy
hands
these
empty
fingers
that
have
ceased
to
clutch
at
stars
because
my
spirit
understands
renouncement
thou
wilt
give
maybe
not
much
i
ask
of
thee
i
only
ask
to
keep
thee
near
o
love
until
my
heart
asleep
ii
my
friend
of
friends
in
you
my
heart
at
rest
that
wandered
homeless
as
the
hither
and
thither
seeking
still
to
find
some
refuge
as
a
ship
that
east
and
west
roams
havenless
and
quits
each
shore
distressed
so
wandered
i
so
left
each
land
behind
bearing
my
soul
as
helmsman
sage
but
blind
and
still
we
journeyed
on
at
fate
behest
but
now
i
hold
my
harbour
and
the
ship
casts
anchor
here
the
unnested
winds
that
blow
may
reach
me
still
and
rock
me
to
and
fro
what
matter
here
is
peace
that
bids
me
slip
closer
and
closer
to
the
enfolding
shore
lower
the
sails
and
stay
for
evermore
iii
are
we
not
happy
though
this
bond
of
ours
be
strange
and
out
of
harmony
with
life
as
men
accept
it
in
this
world
of
strife
between
the
spirit
and
the
flesh
dark
hours
are
in
the
doom
of
every
love
no
flowers
bloom
rainless
wind
and
war
and
pain
are
rife
within
us
yet
we
are
happy
wife
or
sister
these
are
the
soul
showers
its
gifts
of
love
and
seeks
no
earthly
bond
so
ask
we
none
but
smiling
soul
to
soul
stand
gathered
in
love
very
essence
whole
and
indivisible
these
white
strong
bands
suffice
is
but
the
shell
too
frail
and
fond
that
weeps
alas
and
wrings
her
mortal
hands
iv
farewell
you
can
not
go
from
me
my
dear
for
i
have
closed
you
in
my
inmost
heart
beyond
the
reach
of
earthly
things
that
part
the
loving
from
the
loved
now
far
or
near
ceases
to
be
i
am
where
you
are
here
or
there
no
matter
mild
should
be
the
smart
of
where
nothing
stays
apart
but
what
is
mortal
and
where
souls
are
clear
beloved
i
can
but
lose
you
the
hunger
of
the
years
is
stilled
no
pain
of
solitude
can
chill
my
heart
again
possessing
you
therefore
with
steadfast
eyes
i
say
farewell
o
brother
nor
dare
weep
my
little
loss
with
all
this
wealth
to
keep
v
i
seek
to
call
you
near
me
in
the
dark
and
silent
prison
of
my
solitude
where
memory
with
visions
now
mocks
the
night
and
hope
with
timid
spark
kindles
vain
torches
lonely
in
my
ark
of
faith
on
battling
waves
i
float
pursued
by
all
those
doubting
monsters
that
delude
breasts
and
bid
the
soul
embark
for
perilous
despair
i
call
you
near
that
i
may
cheat
the
helmsman
of
his
fear
and
yet
i
know
you
far
i
know
you
lost
to
me
on
this
same
ocean
alone
o
you
who
should
my
pilot
be
you
whom
my
love
could
steer
through
any
sea
vi
when
spring
awakens
and
no
spring
is
there
none
for
the
heart
it
is
a
joyless
thing
yet
winter
softens
and
all
breezes
bring
to
the
hard
earth
now
tidings
vague
and
fair
the
lilac
buds
are
swelling
the
mild
air
tempts
forth
the
green
at
dusk
the
thrushes
sing
out
in
the
garden
and
their
raptures
wring
the
heart
whose
joy
is
of
the
past
i
bear
remembrance
in
me
of
dear
foliage
gone
of
wilted
heather
and
of
perished
flowers
for
me
not
one
of
spring
foreshadowed
hours
is
quick
with
presages
of
joy
alone
who
cares
to
creep
the
solitary
ways
are
and
vain
the
violet
days
vii
if
i
must
live
without
you
i
must
learn
to
love
the
earth
and
all
that
grows
once
more
with
the
old
good
love
that
satisfied
before
i
saw
you
smile
now
let
me
turn
and
turn
your
memory
covers
earth
and
sky
i
yearn
for
you
and
not
for
spring
my
heart
is
sore
with
absence
not
with
winter
length
of
yore
when
climbing
noons
began
to
softly
burn
there
seemed
a
tender
joy
in
every
bud
that
swelled
and
burst
in
every
little
spear
that
broke
the
clods
and
spring
sang
in
my
blood
as
in
the
sap
and
all
that
lived
was
dear
these
treasures
now
are
veiled
and
strange
and
far
whilst
i
go
wandering
where
your
footprints
are
viii
beloved
are
we
not
wanderers
on
a
road
unknown
that
grope
their
way
among
the
rocks
together
yes
together
for
these
shocks
our
hearts
have
borne
and
given
part
not
goad
unto
no
hatred
though
i
be
your
load
of
care
and
you
my
anguish
something
locks
our
hands
my
brother
destiny
that
mocks
man
thinkings
and
here
finds
a
new
strange
mode
of
welding
loves
a
link
that
more
than
human
that
is
half
divine
since
beggared
of
you
still
i
hold
you
mine
above
all
bonds
so
love
me
well
we
drink
of
all
pure
streams
together
dear
and
break
these
rocks
to
sand
for
one
another
sake
ix
yes
love
me
love
me
well
you
need
not
fear
to
hurt
me
further
like
a
careless
knight
that
riding
lonely
with
averted
sight
has
struck
a
passer
unawares
so
here
have
you
struck
me
amid
the
branches
sere
of
this
dark
forest
if
you
now
alight
give
water
to
my
lips
and
through
the
night
keep
peril
from
me
with
the
morning
clear
new
dawn
i
rise
again
and
both
will
reap
the
mercy
of
the
wound
you
dealt
asleep
awake
i
be
your
and
guard
your
steps
upon
this
road
so
long
and
hard
then
help
us
both
for
all
the
love
you
give
but
turns
to
strength
whereby
we
both
may
live
x
dearest
of
all
and
nearest
though
most
far
my
spirit
follows
you
across
both
sea
and
land
all
bounds
all
spaces
are
to
me
erased
my
heart
upon
its
wing√®d
car
of
thought
outstrips
you
nothing
now
shall
mar
my
joy
in
you
o
brother
save
that
we
are
of
the
earth
and
ask
to
touch
and
see
the
thing
we
love
upon
this
yearning
star
o
world
of
strange
desires
have
not
we
two
lived
to
behold
each
other
and
to
smile
have
our
two
notes
not
mingled
in
one
chord
what
ails
us
were
we
joined
this
earthly
while
you
would
not
love
me
better
than
you
do
nor
in
my
heart
be
otherwise
adored
xi
without
you
seem
forgotten
am
i
sad
or
happy
none
can
tell
the
lonely
days
recur
and
draw
me
on
the
beaten
ways
of
all
who
strive
and
toil
the
things
i
had
remain
all
daily
happenings
good
or
bad
fall
as
they
did
success
and
loss
delays
that
sweeten
victory
the
balance
sways
unceasingly
makes
heavy
or
makes
glad
and
this
is
life
such
as
the
world
demands
within
is
otherwise
for
in
the
far
depths
where
my
soul
recoil√®d
sits
there
are
no
echoes
of
such
wisdom
there
my
hands
are
folded
and
in
yours
i
seek
your
eyes
your
voice
your
smile
within
is
otherwise
the
open
air
sunshine
in
february
o
winter
sun
how
beautiful
thy
beams
upon
the
chain√®d
earth
the
snows
are
melting
and
the
gale
is
hushed
thou
shinest
soft
and
pale
o
winter
sun
upon
a
world
that
dreams
and
trembles
with
awakened
hopes
of
birth
o
joyful
green
snowy
patches
gay
thou
peerest
and
the
sky
shines
blue
through
twigg√®d
boughs
each
tree
is
aching
now
with
thoughts
of
thee
o
joyful
green

hands
upon

lie
the
cuckoo

cuckoo
sing
dear
herald
of
the
spring
minstrels
in
all
ages
born
hearing
thee
on
such
a
morn
when
the
cowslips
all
around
waft
their
fragrance
from
the
ground
and
the
blossom
of
the
pear
quivers
white
in
bluest
air
such
as
i
in
all
the
ages
thus
have
covered
rapturous
pages
with
thy
praise
o
loveliest
bird
ear
of
man
has
ever
heard
though
thy
note
be
one
of
sadness
messenger
thou
art
of
gladness
only
for
thou
comest
first
when
the
buds
their
prison
burst
when
upon
an
april
day
earth
awakes
to
cast
away
what
remains
of
wintry
sorrow
and
to
don
for
summer
morrow
joyful
garb
of
newest
green
thou
unseen
east
and
west
thy
piercing
note
from
the
forest
seems
to
float
over
plain
and
over
hill
and
thy
echoing
cries
instil
hope
into
each
breath
that
blows
who
that
hears
thy
voice
but
knows
that
the
joys
of
june
are
nearing
see
the
lilies
in
the
clearing
how
they
raise
their
green
young
bells
every
hasty
bud
that
swells
answers
thee
in
joyfulness
and
the
winter
long
distress
like
a
lifted
cloud
at
dawn
melts
and
quivers
and
is
gone
autumn
leaves
that
strew
the
ways
have
outlived
their
kindly
days
now
the
sun
shall
warm
the
earth
now
all
things
of
tender
birth
newly
waked
from
shielded
sleep
lift
their
coverlet
and
peep
gaily
at
the
world
dear
voice
sing
and
bid
each
soul
rejoice
spring
for
every
breast
that
wills
and
thy
note
o
cuckoo
stills
all
the
ache
of
winter
here
lo
the
scattered
leaves
are
sere
of
my
sorrow
and
i
tread
them
into
earth
the
bough
that
shed
them
soon
in
budded
joy
shall
be
harmonious
with

a

o

out
to

where
the
new
nests
are
is
sin
to
be
pining
the
are
shining
and
the
wild
winds
have
fled
to
the
far

come
and
be
merry
for
white
blows
the
cherry
the
bluebells
ring
out
on
their
stem
so
tall
each
cowslip

cries
joy
to
its

to
the

what

grief
is
all
done
for
the
folded
leaves
creep
from

the
seeds
are
awaking
the
furrows
are
breaking
and
the
blessing

on
the
blackthorn
now
in
a
london
square
the
leaves
are
green
and
in
the
grass
lie
white
and
sweet
that
spring
beneath
the
tender
feet
of
at
play
from
ancient
boughs
serenely
tall
the
chequered
shadows
fall
and
town
seems
far
away
such
rest
is
here
as
woodland
yields
here
too
are
lambs
in
flowered
fields
why
heed
the
wheels
that
pass
thought
sinks
beneath
our
fitful
speech
into
the
tremor
of
our
peace
this
hallowed
hour
of
release
from
dust
and
whirl
and
haste
thus
each
may
find
within
his
breast
a
respite
to
the
world
unrest
fresh
verdure
in
the
waste
life
wheels
encircle
us
but
there
where
friendship
is
the
untainted
air
of
heaven
seems
in
reach
the
call
of
the
green
o
who
would
dwell
in
the
dingy
town
when
june
is
fair
and
green
o
who
would
stay
in
the
chimneyed
town
where
brooks
are
never
seen
come
roses
blow
sweet
flower
will
snow
the
the
shaded
lane
the
woodland
wild
are
better
both
for
man
and
child
o
who
would
live
in
the
narrow
street
when
skies
are
broad
and
free
o
who
would
bide
in
the
stony
street
when
the
sun
is
on
the
sea
come
leave
the
dust
and
hasten
to
the
breath
of
winds
that
chasten
the
surging
waves
the
starry
span
are
better
both
for
child
and
man
summer
ending
over
the
world
a
breath
has
fallen
as
of
spring
the
tender
sky
hangs
tremulous
a
shield
through
which
the
sun
shines
as
the
heart
smiles
in
a
mist
of
tears
the
trees
are
green
still
but
their
branches
bear
the
blossoms
of
the
fall
each
quivering
birch
shakes
golden
coins
upon
her
silver
stem
the
little
rowan
rears
his
corals
gay
the
purple
sloes
are
thick
upon
the
thorn
and
every
breeze
to
the
ground
spoils
red
and
yellow
here
upon
the
hill
where
at
our
feet
heather
glows
among
the
rocks
sweet
peace
enfolds
us
see
on
velvet
slopes
afar
the
patient
kine
in
silence
browse
the
plough
in
furrows
wide
has
turned
the
weary
earth
to
rest
the
sun
sinks
and
across
the
valley
mountains
fade
from
blue
to
grey
and
touch
the
sky
the
hour
of
silver
comes
now
for
the
moon
awakes
and
softly
films
the
dusk
with
light
the
narrow
river
in
her
ample
bed
answers
the
stars
and
soft
serenity
has
spread
her
wings
upon
the
earth
o
heart
of
man
why
must
you
throb
apart
and
know
a
tempered
peace
where
nature
peace
is
pure
already
winter
snows
upon
the
hills
like
phantoms
to
our
vision
rise
the
trees
groan
leafless
in
the
wind
and
ghosts
of
pain
flit
dark
between
the
present
and
our
eyes
is
thus
we
murder
joy
and
let
a
terror
anguish
dear
is
thus
possessing
wealth
we
shiver
poor
ere
we
are
stricken
thus
our
clasp√®d
hands
grow
cold
and
ache
with
solitude
to
be
