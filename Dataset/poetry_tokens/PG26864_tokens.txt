preface
little
volume
was
written
for
no
reason
on
earth
and
with
no
earthly
reason
it
just
simply
happened
on
the
principle
i
suppose
that
murder
will
out
murder
is
a
bad
thing
and
so
are
nonsense
rhymes
there
is
often
a
valid
excuse
for
murder
there
is
none
for
nonsense
rhymes
they
seem
to
be
a
necessary
evil
to
be
classed
with
smallpox
yellow
fever
and
other
irruptive
diseases
they
are
also
on
the
order
of
the
boomerang
and
eventually
rebound
and
inflict
much
suffering
on
the
unlucky
so
you
see
nonsense
like
a
little
learning
is
a
dangerous
thing
and
should
be
handled
with
as
much
care
as
the
shotgun
which
is
never
known
to
be
man
who
writes
nonsense
may
become
in
time
a
big
gun
but
this
is
rare
more
often
he
becomes
a
small
bore
this
appears
paradoxical
and
will
probably
require
thinking
over
but
the
more
you
think
it
over
the
less
you
will
understand
this
is
true
of
parlor
magic
it
is
also
true
of
the
magazine
poets
it
really
never
pays
to
think
thinking
is
too
much
like
work
after
reading
these
rhymes
you
will
not
think
that
the
writer
ever
did
think
which
after
all
is
the
right
way
to
dryden
wrote
alexander
feast
he
modestly
stated
that
it
was
the
grandest
poem
ever
written
dryden
evidently
believed
this
or
he
would
have
said
so
but
then
every
one
did
not
agree
with
dryden
now
i
am
going
one
step
further
and
will
positively
state
that
the
writer
of
this
volume
is
the
greatest
poetical
genius
who
has
not
yet
died
in
is
an
astounding
statement
but
it
can
be
corroborated
by
admiring
friends
for
the
writer
is
like
a
certain
brand
of
children
food
in
that
he
is
advertised
by
his
loving
of
alexander
feast
it
simply
can
not
be
compared
to
any
one
of
the
finished
poetic
gems
in
this
collection
because
it
is
so
utterly
different
the
difference
is
what
made
dryden
famous
but
comparisons
are
odious
and
dryden
has
been
dead
several
but
what
you
may
ask
is
the
object
of
nonsense
verse
most
assuredly
to
make
one
laugh
that
masterpiece
of
nonsense
alice
in
wonderland
and
its
companion
volume
through
the
looking
class
are
absurd
books
but
their
very
absurdity
is
what
appeals
to
us
most
their
author
lewis
carroll
was
in
private
life
a
very
sober
gentleman
at
least
we
hope
so
nonsense
is
the
salt
of
life
with
which
we
season
the
dry
food
of
everyday
a
little
nonsense
now
and
then
is
relished
by
the
wisest
men
serious
old
longfellow
had
this
feeling
in
his
bones
when
he
wrote
the
immortal
lines
which
all
of
us
recall
from
childhood
there
was
a
little
girl
and
she
had
a
little
curl
which
hung
way
down
on
her
forehead
and
when
she
was
good
she
was
very
good
indeed
but
when
she
was
bad
she
was
horrid
is
nonsense
pure
and
simple
and
even
the
most
ardent
admirers
of
longfellow
must
when
they
try
to
make
forehead
and
horrid
rhyme
admit
that
it
was
very
poor
verse
for
the
author
of
evangeline
harte
flew
off
at
a
tangent
when
he
wrote
about
ah
sin
the
chinaman
a
nonsense
poem
that
gave
bill
nye
his
pseudonym
oliver
wendell
holmes
wrote
the
wonderful
shay
rudyard
kipling
is
often
caught
with
the
goods
on
him
and
mark
twain
wrote
an
ode
to
stephen
dowling
botts
great
scott
i
almost
forgot
that
even
such
a
gentle
domestic
creature
as
the
cow
has
been
the
unconscious
inspiration
of
much
nonsense
and
has
doubtless
often
chewed
the
bitter
cud
of
reflection
in
deploring
her
undesired
popularity
first
she
was
forced
very
much
against
her
will
no
doubt
to
jump
over
the
moon
to
the
undignified
strains
of
hey
diddle
diddle
then
just
when
beginning
to
breathe
easily
again
after
that
astounding
performance
gelett
burgess
came
along
and
gave
her
more
notoriety
by
raising
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
purple
cow
and
even
today
in
many
of
the
rural
districts
there
are
old
farmers
who
never
heard
of
burgess
and
his
purple
cow
who
will
tell
you
solemnly
that
there
is
a
cow
of
a
sort
of
purplish
color
which
goes
to
prove
that
after
all
nonsense
is
only
sense
plus
the
poems
in
this
collection
have
appeared
from
time
to
time
in
the
kentucky
post
the
cincinnati
post
the
cincinnati
commercial
tribune
humanity
and
the
valley
magazine
why
the
mole
is
blind
in
days
gone
by
when
cows
could
fly
and
goblins
rode
on
bears
when
fairies
danced
upon
the
green
and
giants
moped
in
lairs
there
lived
alone
upon
a
shelf
a
tinsie
winsie
little
elf
just
when
the
stars
came
out
at
night
and
moonbeams
filled
the
earth
with
light
down
from
his
perch
this
little
elf
would
jump
and
wander
by
himself
he
wore
a
pair
of
little
wings
tied
in
their
place
by
golden
strings
one
day
he
took
a
kind
of
notion
to
take
a
trip
upon
the
ocean
he
combed
his
hair
and
washed
his
face
and
put
his
little
wings
in
place
then
from
his
shelf
he
softly
stole
and
went
to
see
his
friend
the
mole
who
gave
to
him
a
boat
and
guaranteed
that
it
would
float
a
funny
thing
about
this
boat
was
patterned
from
a
note
the
little
elf
was
greatly
pleased
and
laughed
until
he
sneezed
and
sneezed
he
launched
his
boat
upon
the
sea
and
kicked
his
little
heels
in
glee
the
mole
looked
on
in
glad
surprise
for
in
those
days
all
moles
had
eyes
he
shouted
out
a
loud
farewell
as
the
little
rose
and
fell
the
elf
picked
up
a
golden
oar
and
soon
lost
sight
of
mole
and
shore
the
elf
rowed
out
for
quite
a
way
and
in
the
waves
did
sport
and
play
until
at
length
the
sun
sank
low
and
then
he
thought
it
time
to
go
now
just
as
luck
would
have
it
then
a
prowling
sea
gull
left
his
den
the
savage
sea
gull
loudly
laughed
to
see
an
elf
in
such
a
craft
and
swooping
down
upon
the
water
he
did
a
thing
he
had
oughter
for
with
his
strong
and
sturdy
beak
he
caused
the
boat
to
spring
a
leak
he
said
he
longed
for
a
little
change
and
the
boat
was
just
in
range
the
poor
young
elf
gave
one
big
holler
just
as
the
sea
gull
made
a
swallow
and
this
is
strange
indeed
to
follow
for
a
gull
himself
is
just
a
swallow
the
faithful
mole
heard
this
loud
yell
and
rushed
down
to
the
shore
alas
alas
he
was
too
late
and
saw
his
friend
unhappy
fate
he
groaned
and
shrieked
and
tore
his
fur
and
raised
an
awful
din
and
stir
the
sea
gull
heard
this
awful
racket
and
seized
the
mole
just
like
a
packet
he
carried
him
across
the
seas
to
teach
the
young
gulls
a
b
c
but
the
loving
mole
went
blind
with
rage
and
they
had
to
put
him
in
a
cage
and
ever
since
that
fatal
night
the
moles
have
all
been
out
of
sight
now
there
a
coon
in
the
moon
there
was
once
an
eccentric
old
coon
who
ate
dynamite
with
a
spoon
but
when
he
got
loaded
the
powder
exploded
and
now
there
a
coon
in
the
moon
the
county
fair
oh
let
go
out
to
the
county
fair
and
breathe
the
balmy
country
air
and
whittle
a
stick
and
look
at
the
hosses
discuss
the
farmer
profit
and
losses
we
take
a
look
at
the
country
stock
and
drink
some
milk
from
a
dairy
crock
look
at
the
pigs
and
admire
the
chickens
and
try
to
forget
it
hot
as
the
dickens
forget
there
are
any
political
rings
just
think
of
the
butter
and
eggs
and
things
so
wash
off
the
buggy
and
hitch
up
the
mare
and
we
all
go
out
to
the
county
fair
of
the
jefferson
club
a
maddened
horse
comes
down
the
street
with
waving
mane
and
flying
feet
the
crowd
scatters
in
every
direction
it
looks
like
a
fight
at
a
city
election
a
big
policeman
waves
his
hands
and
the
air
is
full
of
vague
commands
while
across
the
street
a
retail
grocer
shrieks
to
his
child
as
the
horse
draws
closer
when
suddenly
out
of
the
mad
hubbub
steps
jimmie
of
the
jefferson
club
every
man
there
holds
his
breath
to
stop
the
horse
means
sudden
death
but
quick
as
a
flash
makes
a
dash
with
all
his
might
and
the
horse
mane
he
brings
the
old
plug
to
a
halt
again
then
every
man
there
doffs
his
hat
and
cries
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
never
since
the
days
of
nero
has
there
been
a
greater
hero
halloween
a
night
when
witches
skim
the
air
when
spooks
and
goblins
climb
the
stair
when
bats
rush
out
with
muffled
wings
and
now
and
then
the
rings
but
just
the
funniest
thing
of
all
is
you
ca
see
when
they
call
saturday
on
the
farm
is
saturday
morn
and
all
is
bright
by
nature
own
endowing
the
sun
is
fiercely
giving
light
and
only
me
plowing
across
the
river
i
hear
the
sound
of
a
boatman
slowly
rowing
i
have
no
time
to
fool
around
especially
when
i
hoeing
and
when
the
dinner
hour
has
come
and
thoughts
of
work
are
fleeting
i
only
hear
the
insects
hum
because
i
busy
eating
at
night
when
all
things
are
at
rest
safe
in
old
morpheus
keeping
no
troubles
do
my
mind
infest
for
i
am
soundly
sleeping
loving
john
john
went
into
the
garden
one
day
and
found
his
baby
sister
at
play
john
hit
baby
with
a
brick
and
laughed
because
it
made
her
sick
john
is
only
two
and
six
and
loves
to
do
these
funny
tricks
the
circus
o
the
circus
parade
o
the
circus
parade
it
lays
all
the
politics
back
in
the
shade
and
the
merchants
forget
that
they
got
any
trade
while
many
remember
they
never
been
paid
as
they
rushed
out
to
look
at
the
circus
parade
and
preachers
who
used
to
be
terribly
staid
yell
just
like
boys
at
the
circus
parade
every
one
there
both
the
mistress
and
maid
all
looking
on
at
the
circus
parade
and
out
at
the
grounds
when
you
seen
the
parade
how
delicious
it
is
to
drink
pink
lemonade
and
look
at
the
elephant
twirling
his
trunk
and
laugh
at
the
capers
cut
by
the
monk
watch
the
old
clown
who
is
acting
a
dunce
and
try
hard
to
see
three
rings
going
at
once
gaze
at
the
ringmaster
cracking
his
whip
and
watch
the
artist
skip
i
saw
that
circus
yes
sirree
saw
about
enough
for
three
lent
oh
lend
me
five
the
young
man
cried
my
money
all
is
spent
the
maiden
shook
her
head
and
sighed
i
sorry
but
it
lent
the
processional
written
in
collaboration
with
b
hamilton
when
julius
caesar
met
his
death
he
muttered
in
his
dying
breath
it
is
not
patriotism
now
prompts
you
to
break
your
friendship
vow
quoth
brutus
as
he
stabbed
again
the
greatest
of
his
countrymen
you
in
this
fix
through
politics
as
on
his
path
columbus
sped
a
sailor
to
the
great
man
said
without
a
break
without
a
bend
the
broad
atlantic
has
no
end
and
to
the
sailor
at
his
side
is
rumored
that
great
man
replied
i
guess

wearied
with
their
toil
cried

old

his
head

to
his
wayward
son

spaniards

glee

he

and
see
moral
thus
onward

through

amid
the
pomp
and
glare
and
show

oft
some
proverb
misconstrue
and
mutter
boldly

not
true
but
in
their
calm
majestic
way

the
tongues

wise
men

christmas

ago

christmas
day

say
we
got
up
in
the
dark
and
had
a
jolly
lark
round
the
fire
the
cold
air
was
shocking
as
we
peeped
in
our
stocking
and
way
down
in
the
toe
now

so
dad

a
dollar

christmas
ai
like
it
used
to
be
the
rubaiyat
of
a
kentuckian
wake
for
the
sun
that
scatters
into
flight
the
poker
players
who
have
stayed
all
night
drives
husbands
home
with
reeling
steps
and
then
gives
to
the
sleepy
cops
an
awful
fright
i
sometimes
think
that
never
blows
so
red
the
nose
as
when
the
spirits
strike
the
head
that
every
step
one
takes
upon
the
way
makes
him
wish
strongly
he
were
home
in
bed
the
moving
finger
writes
but
having
pull
you
think
that
you
can
settle
things
in
full
but
when
you
interview
the
police
judge
you
find
that
you
have
made
an
awful
bull
some
nonsense
verses
underneath
the
bough
a
little
booze
a
time
to
loaf
and
thou
beside
me
howling
in
the
wilderness
would
be
enough
for
one
day
anyhow
the
medicine
man
good
people
if
you
have
the
mumps
or
ever
get
down
with
the
dumps
or
have
bad
cold
or
aching
pains
or
ever
suffer
with
chilblains
do
seek
your
doctor
for
advice
and
pay
him
some
tremendous
price
but
buy
a
drug
that
safe
and
sure
in
fact
get
blank
consumptive
cure
alas
he
led
her
out
across
the
sand
and
by
her
side
did
sit
he
asked
to
hold
her
little
hand
she
sweetly
answered
nit
the
glorious
fourth
and
its
memories
have
you
ever
mused
in
silence
upon
a
summer
day
and
let
your
thoughts
run
riot
and
your
feelings
have
full
sway
as
you
sprawled
full
length
upon
the
grass
in
some
secluded
dell
and
breathed
the
balmy
country
air
and
smelt
the
country
smell
then
as
you
muse
and
gently
snooze
between
thinks
you
remember
those
jinks
when
spirits
were
high
on
the
fourth
of
july
there
was
little
willie
browning
the
worst
of
all
the
boys
who
had
a
cannon
that
made
all
kinds
of
noise
and
when
the
cannon
would
go
he
blew
into
the
muzzle
but
what
became
of
willie
teeth
has
always
been
a
puzzle
how
the
folks
looked
askance
at
the
seats
of
our
pants
when
those
giant
skyrockets
went
off
in
our
pockets
gee
whiz
what
fun
the
fourth
is
when
the
july
sun
began
to
wink
the
clouds
away
we
were
out
with
whoops
and
shoutings
to
celebrate
the
day
with
piece
of
punk
in
one
hand
and
crackers
in
the
other
we
would
troop
home
later
in
the
day
for
linseed
oil
and
mother
but
our
burns
were
small
concerns
our
hearts
were
light
injuries
slight
not
even
a
sigh
on
the
fourth
of
july
and
as
you
lie
and
ponder
the
thought
comes
home
to
you
that
your
youngest
boy
now
celebrates
the
way
you
used
to
do
and
the
mother
that
he
bawls
for
to
have
those
small
wounds
dressed
is
the
woman
whom
long
years
ago
you
swore
you
loved
the
best
but
what
funny
things
memory
brings
who
would
have
thought
that
i
would
be
caught
with
a
tear
in
my
eye
on
the
fourth
of
july
keep
tryin
when
you
feelin
blue
as
ink
an
your
spirits
to
sink
do
be
weak
an
take
a
drink
but
keep
tryin
there
are
times
when
all
of
us
get
riled
up
and
start
a
muss
but
there
ai
no
use
to
cuss
just
keep
tryin
when
things
seem
to
go
awry
and
the
sun
deserts
your
sky
do
sit
down
somewhere
and
cry
but
keep
tryin
everybody

who
never
whine

who
tell

a

on

a
great
big
solemn
vow
that
you
win
out
anyhow
and

was

erratic
who
lived
all
alone
in

wrote

made

curse

his
friends
thought
it
fine

a
seedy
young

in

fell
in

with
a
rich

her
papa
got
mad
and
swore
that
by

the
couple
eloped
to
caracas
where
the
germans
kicked
up
such
a
fracas
and
he
said
to
his
wife
you

very

the

is
never

although
he
run
if
you
say
scat
the
sissy
boy
infinitesimal
he
is
not
worth
a
duodecimal
if
you
should
take
a
custard
pie
and
hit
a
sissy
in
the
eye
he
would
not
go
before
a
jury
he
only
blush
and
say
oh
fury
for
he
is
perfumed
sweet
and
mild
that
just
his
kind
my
dearest
child
one
should
never
strike
a
sissy
he
is
too
and
prissy
you
do
not
need
to
use
your
fist
but
merely
slap
him
on
the
wrist
and
if
this
will
not
make
him
budge
then
glare
at
him
and
say
oh
fudge
the
sissy
sports
a
pink
cravat
and
often
wears
a
high
silk
hat
his
voice
is
like
a
turtle
and
he
always
wears
the
cutest
gloves
at
playing
he
inured
and
his
are
manicured
he
uses
powder
on
his
face
and
his
handkerchiefs
are
trimmed
with
lace
he
loves
to
play
progressive
euchre
and
spend
his
papa
lucre
he
wears
an
air
of
nonchalance
and
always
takes
in
every
dance
socially
he
quite
a
pet
and
always
fashionably
in
debt
he
hates
to
be
considered
slow
and
poses
as
a
famous
beau
he
loves
to
cut
a
swath
and
dash
when
papa
dear
puts
up
the
cash
this
my
child
is
the
sissy
boy
who
acts
so
womanly
and
coy
his
head
as
soft
as
butter
his
aim
in
life
is
just
to
flutter
yet
he
goes
along
with
unconcern
and
marries
a
woman
with
money
to
burn
to
gelett
burgess
i
never
saw
a
purple
cow
you
say
you
never
saw
one
but
this
i
tell
you
anyhow
i
know
that
i
can
draw
one
the
lobster
lobsters
have
any
feet
but
they
have
lots
of
claws
yet
lobster
meat
is
good
to
eat
and
this
is
strange
because
a
dog
is
never
good
to
eat
and
yet
a
dog
has
paws
and
so
have
cats
and
so
have
rats
and
so
have
other
kind
of
brats
a
lobster
then
so
to
speak
is
my
child
an
awful
freak
for
if
you
get
him
in
a
stew
he
blush
quite
red
and
glare
at
you
yet
if
you
eat
much
lobster
salad
it
will
make
you
very
pallid
a
pun
from
the
deep
a
funny
thing
once
happened
to
a
german
from
berlin
for
once
he
got
too
gay
and
seized
a
swordfish
by
the
fin
this
made
the
big
fish
angry
and
he
sawed
the
german
chin
just
tell
them
that
i
saw
you
said
the
swordfish
with
a
grin
stylish
there
once
was
an
old
crocodile
who
lived
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
one
day
for
a
meal
he
swallowed
a
wheel
and
ate
for
dessert
an
automobile
if
i
could
fly
what
the
little
boy
thought
if
i
had
wings
just
like
a
bird
do
you
know
what
i
do
i
fly
way
up
into
the
sky
an
holler
down
at
you
i
fly
along
the
milky
way
feelin
fine
and
chipper
an
then
i
drink
some
buttermilk
fresh
from
out
the
dipper
i
skim
along
through
fleecy
clouds
an
see
the
great
big
bear
an
ask
him
how
he
liked
to
live
so
high
up
in
the
air
would
it
be
dandy
to
fly
just
when
you
please
an
go
an
ask
the
if
he
worried
much
with
fleas
i
do
all
kinds
of
other
things
if
i
could
only
fly
but
i
am
just
a
little
boy
an
so
i
dass
try
a
said
sue
to
her
suitor
you
get
a
new
suit
or
i
sue
for
a
suitor
to
suit
why
sue
said
her
suitor
who
tried
hard
to
suit
her
your
suitor
is
suited

farewell
snow
after
walt
whitman
that
light
that
white
that
weird
uncanny
substance
we
call
snow
is
slowly
sifting
through
the
bare
branches
and
ever
and
anon
my
thoughts
sift
with
the
drifting
snow
and
i
am
full
of
pale
regret
yes
full
of
pale
regret
and
other
things
you
know
what
i
mean
and
why
because
the
snow
must
go
the
time
has
came
to
part
yes
it
can
not
wait
much
longer
like
the
flakes
my
thoughts
are
melting
is
here
is
there
in
fact
is
everywhere
the
snow
i
mean
like
the
thick
syrup
which
covers
buckwheat
cakes
it
lies
the
man
who
says
he
do
regret
its
passing
also
lies
and
wilt
thou
never
come
again
yes
thou
ilt
never
come
again
alas
how
well
i
remember
thee
was
but
yesterday
methinks
when
a
great
daub
of
snow
fell
from
a
nearby
housetop
and
when
i
ventured
poor
foolish
mortal
that
i
was
to
look
caught
me
fairly
in
the
mouth
an
awful
swat
and
nearly
smothered
me
there
is
another
little
trick
of
thine
most
lovely
snow
it
is
but
a
proof
of
thine
affection
to
cling
around
our
necks
but
still
we
swear
we
can
not
help
it
snow
now
it
is
skidoo
or
for
you
oh
cursed
inconstancy
of
man
the
sad
turkey
gobbler
o
a
fat
turkey
gobbler
once
sat
on
a
limb
and
he
sighed
at
the
wind
and
the
wind
sighed
at
him
but
the
grief
of
the
gobbler
one
could
not
diminish
for
it
was
thanksgiving
and
he
saw
his
finish
so
the
heart
of
the
gobbler
was
heavy
as
lead
and
he
muttered
the
words
of
the
poet
who
said
backward
turn
backward
o
time
in
thy
flight

me
a
boy

ah
somewhere

there
is
a

spot
where
the
fire
is
burning
always
and
always
it
is
hot
and
always
fiends
are
shouting
and
always
flames
are
blue
and
always
satan
asking

enough
for
you
when
the
lid
was
on
they
were
seated
there
in
silence
each
one
busy
with
a
frown
it
was
midnight
in
the
city
and
the
lid
was
on
the
town
they
had
all
been
playing
poker
the
rattle
of
the
chink
when
a
gloom
fell
the
party
for
they
could
buy
a
drink
but
a
little
fellow
whispered
as
he
held
a
poker
hand
ca
we
get
as
drunk
on
water
as
we
can
upon
the
land
then
we
kicked
the
little
rascal
and
we
spoke
without
a
frown
and
we
anchored
safe
in
harbor
when
the
lid
was
on
the
town
the
doodle
bug
why
that
a
doodle
bug
my
child
who
lives
alone
remote
and
wild
his
domicile
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
when
at
home
he
easily
found
the
only
plan
allowed
by
law
is
to
lure
him
forth
upon
a
straw
for
the
doodle
bug
is
a
misanthrope
and
otherwise
is
sure
to
elope
grit
i
hate
the
fellow
who
sits
around
and
knocks
the
livelong
day
who
tells
of
the
work
he
might
have
done
if
things
had
come
his
way
but
i
love
the
fellow
who
pushes
ahead
and
smiles
at
his
work
or
play
you
can
wager
when
things
do
come
around
they
will
come
his
way
and
stay
the
next
morning
what
a
difference
in
the
morning
when
you
try
to
raise
your
head
when
your
eyelids
seem
so
heavy
you
could
swear
they
were
of
lead
when
your
tongue
is
thickly
coated
and
you
have
an
awful
thirst
when
you
drink
so
much
cold
water
that
you
feel
about
to
burst
when
you
lift
your
hand
towards
heaven
and
solemnly
do
say
i
going
to
out
drinking
and
i
swear
off
right
a
wonderful
feat
i
never
walk
along
the
street
because
i
have
any
feet
nor
is
this
strange
when
i

that

that

mary
killed
the
little
lamb
and
turned
him
into
mutton
you
could
hardly
notice
it
at
all
there
was
a
girl
in
our
town
who
dearly
loved
to
flirt
but
the
home
folks
never
noticed
it
at
all
the
women
in
the
neighborhood
all
said
she
was
too
pert
but
she
never
even
noticed
them
at
all
one
night
a
young
man
came
to
call
who
was
considered
slow
but
when
he
got
alone
with
her
he
turned
the
lights
down
low
he
begged
her
for
a
little
kiss
she
softly
murmured
no
but
you
could
hardly
notice
it
at
all
the
alarm
clock
with
a
clatter
and
a
jangle
and
a
wrangle
and
a
screech
how
the
old
alarm
clock
wheezes
as
it
sneezes
out
of
reach
how
you
groan
and
yawn
and
stretch
in
the
chilly
morning
air
as
you
pull
the
blankets
tight
with
your
head
clear
out
of
sight
how
you
swear

she
went
to

cupboard
was
bare
and
now
they
are
both
on

knew
a
young
man
so
conceited
that
a
glance
at
his
face
made
you
heated
one
night
playing
whist

was
slapped
on
the
wrist
because
some
one
said
that

the
land
we
adore
my
life
and
death
by
a
turkey
gobbler
i
just
a
turkey
gobbler
but
i
got
a
word
to
say
and
i
like
to
say
it
quickly
before
i
pass
away
for
i
will
get
it
in
the
neck
upon
thanksgiving
day
i
can
not
keep
from
thinking
of
poor
marie
antoinette
she
lost
her
head
completely
but
this
is
what
i
get
they
knock
the
stuffin
out
o
me
without
the
least
regret
i
just
a
few
days
left
now
before
i
meet
my
fate
for
every
turkey
gets
the
axe
the
little
and
the
great
there
never
was
a
turkey
born
who
did
fill
a
plate
only
three
days
left
now
goodness
how
time
flies
it
brings
a
sadness
to
my
heart
and
teardrops
to
my
eyes
does
every
turkey
feel
that
way
three
days
before
he
dies
this
is
a
very
cruel
world
i
talking
sober
facts
for
i
was
only
raised
to
be
the
victim
of
an
axe
the
butt
of
all
your
silly
jokes
and
all
your
funny
cracks
and
when
you
sit
down
thursday
how
happy
you
will
be
every
person
gathered
there
will
eat
enough
for
three
i
be
the
guest
of
honor
that
dinner
is
on
me
i
the
ghost
of
that
poor
gobbler
who
used
to
be
so
great
they
took
my
poor
neglected
bones
and
piled
them
on
a
plate
reader
shed
a
kindly
tear
for
my
unhappy
fate
this
is
the
common
lot
of
all
upon
the
world
great
chart
we
got
to
leave
a
pile
of
bones
the
stupid
and
the
smart
even
when
napoleon
died
he
left
a
bonaparte
we
are
merely
puppets
moving
on
a
string
and
when
we
think
that
we
are
it
the
axe
will
fall
gezing
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
o
death
where
is
thy
sting
if
i
were
city
editor
after
ben
king
dedicated
to
jesse
conway
if
i
were
city
editor
and
you
should
come
to
my
cold
desk
and
choke
and
say
old
man
i
actually
dead
broke
i
say
if
i
were
city
editor
and
you
should
come
in
deepest
grief
and
woe
and
say
oh
lordy
let
me
have
the
dough
i
might
arise
with
slow
and
solemn
wink
and
lecture
you
upon
the
curse
of
drink
if
i
were
city
editor
and
you
should
come
to
my
hotel
and
reel
clasping
my
beer
to
quench
the
thirst
you
feel
i
say
if
i
were

and
you
should
come
in
trembling
and
in
fear
and
even
hint
about
licking
up
that
beer
i
hit
you
just
one
swat
and
then
i
guess
i
have
to
order
one
more
bier
transcendentalism
what
is
transcendentalism
merely
sentimentalism
with
a
dash
of
egotism
somewhat
mixed
with
mysticism
not
at
all
like
socialism
nor
a
bit
like
atheism
hinges
not
on

of

asceticism
quite
opposes
anarchism
ca
you
name
another
ism
yes
it
transcendentalism
the
epic
of
the
hog
man
inhumanity
to
hogs
makes
countless
thousands
squeal
i
lived
upon
a
little
farm
a
happy
hog
was
i
i
never
dreamed
of
any
harm
nor
ever
thought
to
die
all
day
i
wallowed
in
the
mud
and
ate
the
choicest
slops
i
watched
the
brindles
chew
their
cud
the
farmer
tend
his
crops
upon
the
hottest
days
i
go
and
flounder
in
the
river
i
thought
that
hogs
might
come
and
go
but
i
would
live
forever
then
finally
i
waxed
so
fat
that
i
could
hardly
walk
and
then
the
farmers
gather
and
all
began
to
talk
i
could
understand
a
word
all
i
did
was
grunt
you
see
that
all
a
hog
can
do
it
is
his
only
stunt
but
finally
they
took
me
out
and
put
me
on
a
train
i
really
could
move
about
and
squealed
with
might
and
main
i
grunted
grunted
as
i
flew
and
moved
in
vain
endeavor
but
even
then
i
thought
it
true
that
i
would
live
forever
and
so
we
came
to
packingtown
where
there
were
hogs
galore
i
never
saw
so
many
hogs
in
all
my
life
before
then
we
had
to
shoot
the
chutes
and
climb
a
flight
of
stairs
we
never
had
a
chance
to
stop
or
time
to
say
our
prayers
hogs
above
below
they
formed
a
seething
river
for
men
may
come
and
men
may
go
but
hogs
go
on
forever
and
then
i
saw
an
iron
wheel
which
stood
alone
in
state
and
then
i
heard
an
awful
squeal
a
hog
had
met
his
fate
a
devilish
chain
upon
the
wheel
had
seized
him
by
the
leg
it
was
no
use
to
kick
and
squeal
it
was
no
use
to
beg
i
longed
in
deepest
grief
and
woe
to
leave
that
brimming
river
if
once
into
that
room
you
go
your
fate
is
sealed
forever
farewell
farewell
a
long
farewell
around
the
room
i
spin
and
then
a
fellow
with
a
knife
smites
me
below
the
chin
dear
reader
i
was
just
a
hog

is
h

in

in
deeper
vein
the
incubus
the
way
was
dark
within
the
gloomy
as
i
wandered
through
the
woodland
near
the
stream
with
slow
and
heavy
tread
through
a
city
of
the
dead
when
suddenly
i
heard
a
dreadful
scream
my
heart
gave
frantic
leap
as
when
the
roebuck
is
started
by
the
clamor
of
the
chase
and
i
halted
all
atremble
in
the
vain
hope
to
dissemble
or
cloak
the
leaden
pallor
on
my
face
was
in
the
ghostly
month
of
grim
december
the
frozen
winds
were
bitter
in
their
cry
and
i
muttered
half
aloud
to
that
white
and
silent
crowd
is
a
somber
month
to
live
in
or
to
die
and
then
as
if
in
answer
to
my
whisper
came
a
voice
of
some
foul
fiend
from
hell
no
longer
live
say
i
is
better
far
to
die
and
let
the
falling
sound
the
knell
perched
upon
a
tombstone
sat
the
creature
grewsome
as
an
unquenched
burning
lust
sitting
livid
there
with
an
stare
a
stare
that
seemed
the
mocking
of
the
just
and
in
my
thoughts
the
dreadful
thing
is
sitting
sitting
there
with
eyelids
red
and
blear
and
see
it
there
i
will

restless

the
war
of
the
rats
and

far
back
within
an
age
remote
which
common
history
fails
to
note
when
dogs
could
talk
and
pigs
could
sing
and
frogs
obeyed
a
wooden
king
there
lived
a
tribe
of
rats
so
mean
that
such
a
set
was
never
seen
for
during
all
the
livelong
day
they
fought
and
quarrelled
in
the
hay
and
then
at
night
they
robbed
the
mice
who
always
were
so
kind
and
nice
they
stole
their
bread
they
stole
their
meat
and
all
the
jam
they
had
to
eat
they
gobbled
up
their
pies
and
cake
and
everything
the
mice
could
bake
they
stuffed
themselves
with
good
fresh
meal
and
ruined
all
they
could
not
steal
they
slapped
their
long
tails
in
the
butter
until
they
made
a
frightful
splutter
then
sleek
and
fine
in
coats
of
silk
they
swam
about
in
buttermilk
they
ate
up
everything
they
found
and
flung
the
plates
upon
the
ground
and
catching
three
mice
by
their
tails
they
drowned
them
in
the
then
seeing
it
was
morning
light
they
scampered
home
with
all
their
might
the
living
far
and
near
at
once
this
awful
thing
did
hear
and
all
declared
with
cries
of
rage
a
war
against
the
rats
they
wage
the
blew
a
trumpet
blast
and
soon
the
mice
came
thick
and
fast
from
every
place
in
every
manner
and
crowded
round
the
royal
banner
each
had
a
sword
a
bow
and
arrow
each
felt
as
brave
as
any
sparrow
and
promised
in
the
coming
fight
to
die
or
put
the
rats
to
flight
the
king
put
on
a
coat
of
mail
and
tied
a
to
his
tail
he
wore
a
pistol
by
his
side
and
on
a
he
did
ride
march
on
he
cried
and
hot
and
thick
his
army
rushed
in
double
quick
and
hardly
one
short
hour
had
waned
before
the
ranks
the
gained
with
sounding
drum
and
screaming
fife
enough
to
raise
the
dead
to
life
the
rats
awakened
by
the
clatter
rushed
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
then
down
the
whole
flew
and
many
thieving
rats
it
slew
the
mice
hurrahed
the
rats
they
squealed
and
soon
the
dreadful
was
blue
with
smoke
and
red
with
fire
and
filled
with
blood
and
savage
ire
the
rats
had
eaten
so
much
jam
so
many
pies
and
so
much
ham
and
were
so
fat
and
sick
and
swollen
with
all
the
good
things
they
had
stolen
that
they
could
neither
fight
nor
run
and
so
the
mice
the
battle
won
they
threw
up
in
the
air
they
piled
up
everywhere
and
slaughtered
rats
bestrewed
the
ground
for
ten
or
twenty
miles
around
the
galloped
from
the
field
when
all
the
rest
were
forced
to
yield
but
though
he
still
retained
his
skin
he
nearly
fainted
with
chagrin
to
think
that
in
that
bloody
tide
so
many
of
his
rats
had
died
fierce
anger
blazed
within
his
breast
he
would
not
stop
to
eat
or
rest
but
spurring
up
his
fiery
steed
he
seized
a
sharp
and
trusty
reed
then
wildly
shouting
rushed
like
hail
to
cut
off
little
tail
the
face
turned
red
with
passion
to
see
a
rat
come
in
such
fashion
for
he
had
just
that
minute
said
that
every
thieving
rat
was
dead
the
rat
was
scared
and
tried
to
run
and
vowed
that
he
was
just
in
fun
but
nought
could
quell
the
fury
he
cared
not
then
for
judge
or
jury
and
with
his
sharp
and
quivering
spear
he
pierced
the
rat
right
through
the
ear
the
rat
fell
backward
in
the
clover
kicked
up
his
legs
and
all
was
over
the
mice
with
loud
and
joyful
tones
now
gathered
all
the
bad
rats
bones
and
with
them
built
a
pyramid
down
which
their
little
children
slid
and
after
that
eventful
day
the
mice
in
peace
and
joy
could
play
for
now
no
wicked
rats
could
steal
their
cakes
and
jam
and
pies
and
meal
nor
catch
them
by
their
little
tails
and
drown
them

clouds
roll
by
to
con
some
book
when
the
pulse
of
youth
beats
high
to
thrill
when
the
dying
sunset
glows
through
the
heart
of
a
mystic
wood
to
drink
the
sweetness
of
some
wild
rose
and
to
find
the
whole
world
good
to
bring
unto
others
joy
and
mirth
and
keep
what
friends
you
can
to
learn
that
the
rarest
gift
on
earth
is
the
love
of
your
fellow
man
to
hold
the
respect
of
those
you
know
to
scorn
dishonest
pelf
to
sympathize
with
another
woe
and
just
be
true
to
yourself
to
find
that
a
woman
honest
love
in
this
great
world
of
strife
gleams
steadfast
like
a
star
above
the
dark
morass
of
life
to
feel
a
baby
clinging
hand
to
watch
a
mother
smile
to
dwell
once
more
in
fairyland
these
are
the
things
worth
while
