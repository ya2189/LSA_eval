preface
the
writer
of
the
following
pages
has
been
in
the
habit
for
many
years
of
amusing
himself
with
the
composition
of
poetry
often
has
he
been
advised
by
his
friends
to
publish
and
at
length
influenced
by
their
persuasion
and
feeling
a
sort
of
paternal
fondness
for
the
offspring
of
his
own
brain
he
ventures
to
present
this
small
volume
to
the
notice
of
the
public
it
contains
poems
of
many
different
kinds
composed
of
course
in
as
many
varieties
of
style
and
the
author
has
exerted
his
best
endeavours
to
render
them
worthy
of
approbation
the
present
times
he
is
well
aware
are
unfavourable
for
the
publication
of
poetical
works
the
booksellers
complain
generally
of
the
little
demand
for
them
nevertheless
it
is
very
improbable
that
poetry
if
excellent
as
it
ought
to
be
to
deserve
the
name
should
ever
be
totally
neglected
the
seed
of
poetic
taste
is
sown
by
the
hand
of
nature
in
the
souls
of
all
men
though
in
a
small
number
only
it
is
by
culture
brought
to
maturity
the
author
has
exalted
ideas
of
poetry
he
deems
it
decidedly
the
first
of
the
fine
arts
it
is
the
most
intellectual
the
most
comprehensive
the
most
powerful
the
most
delightful
and
also
hear
it
utilitarians
the
most
useful
in
remote
antiquity
as
is
well
known
it
was
chiefly
instrumental
in
teaching
and
civilising
the
human
race
to
lure
their
wild
minds
into
reflection
it
invested
truth
and
morality
with
the
garb
of
fiction
and
introduced
them
through
their
delighted
imagination
to
their
understanding
and
their
heart
while
by
the
charm
of
harmonious
numbers
it
soothed
their
fierce
and
licentious
passions
into
submission
to
the
laws
of
social
life
it
was
believed
to
have
something
divine
in
its
nature
and
was
universally
held
in
the
highest
veneration
from
ancient
times
even
to
this
day
it
has
continued
to
be
a
favourite
study
with
many
of
the
most
illustrious
characters
finally
and
let
this
be
for
ever
remembered
as
conferring
on
it
the
highest
honour
poetry
has
been
deemed
worthy
by
the
sacred
writers
to
be
made
an
instrument
in
the
cause
of
religion
and
by
its
sublime
descriptions
it
has
assisted
human
imagination
in
forming
grand
and
awful
conceptions
of
the
almighty

of
a

lady
sylvia
on
her
dead
sweet
little
warbler
art
thou
dead
and
must
i
hear
thy
notes
no
more
then
will
i
make
thy
funeral
bed
then
shall
the
muse
thy
loss
deplore
beneath
the
turf
in
yonder
bower
where
oft
i
listened
to
thy
lay
forgetting
care
while
many
an
hour
in
music
sweetly
stole
away
there
will
i
bid
thy
relics
rest
then
sadly
sigh
my
last
farewell
but
long
oh
long
within
my
breast
thy
memory
poor
bird
shall
dwell
still
to
that
spot
now
more
endear
shall
thy
fond
mistress
oft
return
and
haply
feel
her
sorrows
cheer
to
deck
with
verse
thy
simple
urn
lies
a
bird
once
famed
to
be
peerless
in
plumage
and
in
lay
this
was
the
soul
of
melody
and
that
the
golden
blush
of
day
as
the
morn
began
to
peep
while
yet
with
shade
her
smiles
were
veil
the
sprightly
warbler
shook
off
sleep
and
with
his
song
her
coming
hail
guardian
rose
nor
scorn
as
mean
but
found
it
still
a
pleasing
care
to
keep
his
little
mansion
clean
and
minister
his
daily
fare
dewy
groundsel
was
his
feast
which
when
the
watchful
songster
view
straight
his
loud
thrilling
strain
he
ceased
and
softly
chirp
his
gratitude
would
he
peck
his
savoury
treat
turn
his
head
sly
and
breathe
a
note
now
flutter
wild
with
wings
and
feet
then
silent
sit
now
pour
his
throat
playful
freaks
his
joyous
lay
well
pleased
his
mistress
would
attend
it
call
affection
into
play
and
gave
to
solitude
a
friend
happily
his
days
he
led
even
to
the
ninth
revolving
year
then
fate
alas
her
weapon
sped
and
pity
laid
his
relics
here
to
julia
should
phoebus
desert
my
mind
and
should
the
nine
their
aid
refuse
enchanting
girl
i
still
could
find
a
theme
in
thee
in
thee
a
muse
can
fiction
any
charms
devise
that
proudly
may
with
thine
compare
on
thee
she
turns
her
wondering
eyes
and
drops
the
pencil
in
despair
far
sweeter
are
thy
notes
to
me
than
sweetest
poet
ever
sung
and
true
perfection
would
it
be
to
sing
thy
beauties
with
thy
tongue
let
phoebus
then
desert
my
mind
and
let
the
nine
their
aid
refuse
ever
my
julia
shall
i
find
in
thee
a

in
thee
a

sing
lovely
girl
to
hear
thee
sing
hush
is
the
listening
air
my
spirit
trembles
on
the
wing
and
no
delay
can
bear
those
eyes
that
smile
supprest
thy
conscious
power
betray
yet

the
bold
request
come
steal
my
heart
away
see
see
those
ruby
lips
divide
an
ivory
shrine
appears
there
harmony
and
love
reside
to
ravish
mortal
ears

they
from

recess
breathe
their
celestial
lays
the
enchanting
sounds
my
thought
possess
with
rapture
and
amaze
still
pressing
on
with
strong
control
i
feel
the
lavish
strain
till
drunk
with
bliss
my
wilder
soul
reels
on
the
brink
of
pain
ah
how
could
i
so
rashly
dare
contend
with
powers
divine
the
pride
of
victory
forbear
my
heart
is
wholly
thine
on

dance
at

opera
in

fine
aerial
shape
in

through

the
lovely
figure
flows

air
unconscious

it
goes

a

strain
its
fairy
gait
attends
in
concord
every
sound
with
every
movement
blends

now
the
passive
form
moves
as
the
music
leads
each
motion
from

note
harmoniously
proceeds
by
the

methinks
at

i
hear
and
see
and
ears
and
eyes
and

are
all
one
harmony
along
my
shivering
nerves
the
mingled
raptures
thrill
and
strangely
take
my
soul

it
as
they

thy

to
our
loves
perhaps
may
yield
consent

were
thy
parting
words

teaze
me
with
his
flattering

fool
to
suppose
his
praise
could
make
me

behind
you

badly
your

take
the

no

i
am

the
wonder
is
i
work
my

so
fast
sure
such
another
never

made
it
maker
must
have
been
a

the

i
his

it
for

till
he

david
ha

well
said
young
jester
though
bereft
of
strength
and
patience
yet
your

is
left
but
come
good
friend
to
dinner
let
us
go
tired
are
my
limbs
my
wasted
spirits
low
giles
poor
david
age
is
weak
soon
jaded
out
i
feel
as
when
beginning
fresh
and
stout
your
easy
task
is
ended
therefore
dine
i
scorn
refreshment
till
i
finish
mine
david
then
to
yon
grassy
bank
i
will
retreat
shaded
by
willows
from
the
oppressive
heat
there
may
we
dine
and
seated
all
at
ease
imbibe
fresh
vigour
with
the
cooling
breeze
giles
curse
his
old
arms
so
nimble
and
so
strong
how
calmly
did
he
seem
to
creep
along
while
i
for
conquest
strove
with
eager
pain
and
labour
sweated
panted
all
in
vain
this
awkward
tool
yet
no
defect
i
see
the
ground
uneven
some
cause
must
there
be
he
the
best
mower
let
it
not
be
known
no
crafty
giles
that
secret
is
your
own
fatigue
thirst
hunger
strongly
urge
me
i
him
with
some
fair
pretence
david
ha
ha
the
foolish
vanity
of
youth
such
painful
efforts
to
disguise
the
truth
who
comes
what
giles
so
quickly
change
your
mind
too
wise
i
thought
to
tarry
long
behind
giles
in
one
employment
when
good
fellows
meet
they
should
together
toil
together
eat
david
here
let
us
sit
against
this
trunk
i
lean
you
against
that
the
dinner
placed
between
giles
now
rest
we
silent
till
our
meal
be
done
while
in
our
ears
sweet
watery
murmurs
run
david
right
when
the
body
feels
recruited
force
more
eloquently
will
the
mind
discourse
giles
now
david
i
attempt
a
loftier
strain
listen
and
judge
of
my
poetic
vein
see
phoebus
his
meridian
height
attains
and
like
a
king
in
all
his
splendour
reigns
beneath
his
scorching
radiance
nature
lies
feverish
and
faint
her
beauteous
verdure
dies
oppress
and
panting
with
the
sultry
heat
the
flocks
and
herds
to
shades
or
streams
retreat
through
the
still
air
no
zephyr
dares
to
play
lest
his
soft
pinion
melt
in
heat
away
but
if
to
mitigate
the
solar
ray
a
lucid
cloud
should
kindly
intervene
then
the
glad
zephyrs
sport
beneath
the
grateful
screen
david
how
beautiful
the
thoughts
and
how
sublime
rich
is
the
language
and
exact
the
rhyme
inform
me
friend
are
those
fine
strains
your
own
they
rise
superior
to
the
rustic
tone
giles
why
not

then
the
gift
of

wealth
and
rank
exclusively
belong

will
oft

with
the

her
abode
to
make
with
me
the
kind
enchantress
long
has
dwelt
long
has
my
soul
her
inspirations
felt
david
i
once
the
feelings
of
a
poet
knew
though
in
my
best
of
days
no
match
for
you
but
now
my
genius
yields
to
conquering
time
yet
still
i
keep
my
judgment
and
my
rhyme
then
what
that
judgment
dictates
i
declare
no
tuneful
shepherd
can
with
you
compare
although
in
many
a
county
i
have
been
and
many
a
rural
poet
i
have
seen
giles
o
cease
your
high
applauses
kindest
friend
for
sure
my
merit
they
must
far
transcend
how
different
men
in
different
ways
excel
my
forte
is
rhyming
your

well
and
while
to
me
you
deign
in

to
yield
you
bear
the
scythe
triumphant
through

david
that
only
youth
whose
lays
resembling
your
deserve
the

near
this
place

memory
i
lack
yes
now
i
recollect
five
summers
back
when
to
these
parts
for
i
came
how
all
the
fields
resounded
with
his
fame
the
bard
i
beheld
but
heard
the
swains
still
with
delight
repeat
his
peerless
strains
not
less
by
fortune
than
the
muses
blest
no
cares
of
life
disturb
his
peaceful
breast
for
poesy
alone
his
happy
soul
possest
did
you
not

full
well
i

muse
then
sweetly

on

alas
my

those
blissful
hours

no

my

the

whom
my
friend
once
would
despise
with
all
his
boyish
wiles
now
taken
ample
vengeance
made
thee
feel
his

shaft
and
taught
thy

with
sacred
awe
repentant
to
confess
the

of

is
indeed
a

i
greet
his
triumph

his

that
was

love
has

the
great

parent
when
she
breathed
into
thine
earthly
frame
the
breath
of
life
indulgently
conferr
on
thee
a

of
finer
essence
capable
to
trace
to

captivate
and
softly
rule
the
hearts
of
all
men
chiefly
such
as
thou
by
partial
nature
favour
from
the
birth
why
wast
thou
then
reluctant
to
confess
the
sovereignty
of
love
so
strangely
deaf
through
half
thy
genial
season
to
the
voice
of
nature
kindly
calling
thee
to
taste
felicity
congenial
to
thy
soul
this
was
the
secret
cause
inscrutable
to
vulgar
minds
who
fancied
thee
to
celibacy
for
thyself
alone
existing
but
i
rightlier
judged
my
friend
the
cause
was
this
there
lurk
within
thy
breast
a
visionary
flame
for
while
retired
in
solitude
on
classic
lore
intent
thy
fancy
to
console
thee
for
the
loss
of
female
intercourse
conceived
a
maid
with
each
soft
charm
each
moral
grace
adorn
fit
empress
of
thy
soul
and
oft
would
hope
gaze
on
the
lovely
phantom
till
at
length
she
dared
to
stand
on
disappointment
verge
anticipating
such
thy
future
bride
what
wonder
then
that
chloe
golden
locks
should
weave
no
snare
for
thee
that
delia
eyes
so
darkly
bright
should
innocently
glance
nor
dart
their
lightnings
through
thy
kindling
frame
that
many
a
fair
should
unregarded
pass
so
far
unlike
the
picture
in
thy
mind
at
last
in
happy
hour
my
friend
beheld
partial
a
maid
of
mild
engaging
mien
of
artless
manners
affable
and
gay
yet
modestly
reserved
with
native
taste
endued
with
genuine
feeling
with
a
heart
expansive
generous
and
a
mind
in
things
of
prime
concern
still
as
with
anxious
doubt
thou
didst
pursue
the
delicate
research
new
virtues
upon
thy
ravish

she
was
she
then
marvelling

her

in
thy

for
who
could
stand
between
the
realms
of
happiness
and
pain
waiting
his
sentence
fearless
o
my
friend
what
was
thy
transport
when
the
gracious
maid
with
virgin
blushes
and
approving
smile
received
thy
vows
consented
to
be
thine
now
then
let
friendship
gratulate
thy
lot
supremely
blest
and
let
her
fondly
hope
that
while
the
names
of

thrill
thy

with

a
stillness
reigns

that
in
fancy
jealous
ear
a
sad
prophetic
breeze
complains
of
some
impending
doom

is

shout
his

loud
with
haughty
bliss

spirit
glows
sudden
deserted
and
alone
confused
alarm
in
dreary
shades
unknown
he
hears
the
wild
waves
beat
the
shore
the
din
of
battle
roar
is
silence
frowning
vengeful
from
the
gloom
before
his
shrinking
eyes
unnumber
spectres
rise
point
to
their
bleeding
wounds
and
sternly
curse
their
doom
the
conscious
murderer
starts
the
thunders

hell
dread
chaos
yawns
on
his
despairing
soul
but
when
the
morn
exerts
her
cheering
power
and

disappears
wilt
thou

slight
the
warning
hour
and
fondly
strive
to
dissipate
thy
fears
yet

thou
dare
fulfil
the
madness
of
thy

kindle
round
earth
the
wasteful
flames
of
strife
and
glut
the
fiends
of

with
human

at
thy

often
visits
thee
and
dares
in
many
a
scene
with
the
more
powerful
charms
of
her
majestic
sister
to
combine
her
pleasing
graces
i
delight
to
view
thy
snowy
robe
of
purest
glowing
white
the
clear
blue
skies
the
cheerful
evergreen
amid
the
wintry
desert
from
whose
boughs
the
little
redbreast
chirps
the
trees
and
herbs
with
snow
and
hoarfrost
fringed
to

presenting
pictured
shapes
and
when
the
sun
sheds
them
his
effulgence
sparkling
keen
with

living
particles
of
light
but
with
far
nobler
transport
i

thy
nightly
scene
o
winter
when
by
frost
refined
and
clear
the
pure
transpicuous
air
through
her
thin
azure
veil
to
wondering
man
displays
the

expatiates
in
the

space
ranging
from

from

with
wonder
and
astonishment
and
sacred
awe
till
lifting
up
her
eyes
she
sees
religion
from
the
opening
gate
of
heaven
itself
on
her
seraphic
wings
smiling
descend
she
feels
her
power
divine
and
raptured

oppressive
on

the

child
comes
with
a

of
demons
to

down
oh

on

the
nightingale
thanks
for
thy
song
sweet
bird
thanks
for
thy
song
o
was
delightful
how
have
i
been
lost
as
in
a
blissful
dream
how
has
my
soul
been
wafted
in
a
sea
of
melody
scarce
yet
am
i
awake
yet
scarce
myself
still
with
the
enchanting
music
dying
breath
the
air
is
kept
in
motion
and
conveys
sweet
whispers
to
the
ear
or
is
it
but
an
echo
from
the
cell
of
memory
that
deludes
my
doating
sense
ah
now
is
gone
silence
resumes
her
sway
and
my
hearing
spreads
her
subtile
web
but
she
resumes
it
changed
methinks
in
nature
more
soft
more
amiable
as
if
with
the
departed
soul
of
harmony
thanks
for
thy
song
sweet
bird
it
well
deserves
all
my
heart
gratitude
for
it
has
its
anxious
throbbings
and
removed
the
load
of
sadness
that
oppress
the
springs
of
life
more
lightly
now
it
beats
and
welcomes
back
the
glowing
tide
of
health
and
conscious
feels
the
blessing
of
existence
it
imparts
to
all
my
frame
reanimating
force
my
nerves
partake
of
its
elastic
spring
no
longer
falsely
sentient
they
receive
the
just
impression
from
external
things
vibrate
harmoniously
to
nature
touch
and
in
her
general
concert
bear
a
part
thanks
sweetest
bird
enchanting
nightingale
how
by
the
magic
influence
of
thy
song
how
am
i
changed
from
what
of
late
i
was
and
every
object
too
how
seems
it
changed
this
wood
when
first
i
enter
it
to
fancy
eye
the
haunt
of
melancholy
her
dreariest
haunt
where
in
her
saddest
mood
the
goddess
loved
to
dwell
was
lonesome
gloom
and
awful
stillness
all
i
felt
her
power
the
imaginative
spirit
she
with
a
mysterious
load
of
shapeless
feeling
her
leaden
hand
oppress
my
labouring
heart
upon
the
ground
i
sank
scarce
sensible
and
buried
as
it
were
in
conscious
death
with
what
soft
influence
what
resistless
power
did
thy
mellifluous
strain
kind
philomel
insinuate
itself
into
my
ear
melting
its
dull
unwillingness
to
listen
and
opening
soon
a
passage
to
my
heart
but
thou
again
be
hush
my
soul
o
wondrous
power
of
heavenly
harmony
see
philomel
the
goddess
of
the
night
charm
with
thy
strains
her
cloudy
veil
withdraws
and
pays
thee
with
a
smile
of
gratitude
a
smile
that
to
her
beauty
adds
new
charms
enchanting
heaven
and
earth
while
melancholy
sighing
away
her
sadness
lifts
her
head
and
gazing
on
her
tutelary
power
with
eyes
reflecting
soft
her
dewy
light
feels
her
divinest
inspiration
steal
into
her
melting
soul

in

my
sympathizing
heart
with
bliss

all
the

striving

ye
pour
the
stream

desert
thee
loveliest

lore
indulgent
power
the
offence
forgive
lured
by
the
specious
name
philosophy
and
by
her
meteor
rays
misled
with
fond
presumptuousness
i
strove
to
penetrate
the
dark
unfathom
depth
where
truth
in
awful
mystery
resides
not
deigning
in
thy
mirror
to
behold
her
image
though
in
loveliest
beauty
clad
with
lawless
curiosity
i
sought
to
view
the
goddess
in
her
naked
form
but
heaven
to
man
nor

gives
to
scan
truth
very
self
she
lives
for
ever
hid
shrined
in
the
bosom
of
divinity
long
wandering
mid
the
chaos
i
at
length
approach
the
border
of
the
cold
dark
waste
the
bottomless
abyss
the
dreadful
void
of
scepticism
affrighted
back
i
shrunk
o
fancy
will
i
forsake
thee
more
nor
view
thee
with
severe
eye
melting
thy
fairy
visions
into
air
thy
paradise
delighted
let
me
rove
there
study
nature
and
with
grateful
heart
in
thy
serene
translucent
stream
behold
the
light
of
truth
reflected
and
the
smile
of
heaven
benevolence
and
in
that
glass
the
loveliness
of
every
virtue
woo
and
every
grace
there
let
me
too
behold
in
all
her
beauty
poesy
that
heavenly
maid
who
charm
my
youthful
heart
and
let
the
love
of
glory
fire
my
breast
and
let
me
see
to
stimulate
my
powers
the
crescent
of
my
fame
ascend
while
on
its
pointed
horn
the
fairy
hope
on
tiptoe
stands
fluttering
her
airy
wings
to
fan
its
beams
and
joyful
hails
the
hour
when
in
its
glory
it
shall
shine
a
come
my
dear
love
and
let
us
climb
yon
hill
the
prospect
from
its
height
will
well
reward
the
toil
of
climbing
thence
we
shall
command
the
various
beauties
of
the
landscape
now
we
have
reached
the
top
o
what
a
scene
opens
upon
the
sight
and
swallows
up
the
admiring
soul
she
feels
as
if
from
earth
uplifted
into
heaven
scarce
can
she
yet
collect
herself
and
exercise
her
powers
while
heaven
lofty
arch
and
round
the
vast
horizon
the
bold
eye
shoots
forth
her
view
with
what
sublime
delight
the
bosom
swells
see
where
the
god
of
day
who
through
the
cloudless
ether
long
has
rid
on
his
bright
fiery
car
amidst
a
blaze
of
dazzling
glory
and
in
wrath
shot
round
his
burning
arrows
with
tyrannic
power
oppressing
nature
now
his
daily
course
completed
toward
the
western
goal
declines
and
with
less
awful
majesty
concludes
his
reign
his
flamy
chariot
hid
in
floods
of
golden
light
that
dazzles
still
though
less
intense
o
how
these
scenes
exalt
the
throbbing
heart
louisa
canst
thou
bear
these
strong
emotions
do
they
not
thy
tender
nerves
i
fear
my
love
they
do
those
eyes
that
late
with
transport
beam
so
bright
now
veil
their
rays
with
the
soft
dewy
shade
of
tenderness
let
us
repose
awhile
the
roots
of
yonder
tree
cover
with
moss
present
a
pleasing
seat
there
let
us
sit
hark
zephyr
wakes
and
tells
the
approach
of
eve
already
nature
feels
her
soothing
influence
her
refreshing
breath
the
fields
the
trees
imbibe
the
cool
moist
air
their
feverish
thirst
allay
and
smile
revived
the
soul
too
feels
her
influence
sweetly
soothed
into
a
tender
calm
o
let
us
now
my
loved
louisa
let
us
now
enjoy
the
landscape
charms
and
all
the
nameless
sweets
of
this
our
favourite
hour
for
ever
dear
to
fancy
and
to
love
cast
round
thy
sight
upon
the
altered
scene
nor
longer
fear
the
dazzling
sun
his
latest
lingering
beams
where
are
they
thou
find
them
see
they
gild
the
glittering
top
of
yonder
upon
that
distant
hill
they
faintly
shine
and
look
the
topmost
boughs
of
this
tall
oak
majestic
which
our
heads
yet
catch
their
tremulous
glimmerings
now
they
fade
fade
and
expire
and
as
they
fade
the
moon
the
moon
that
seem
erewhile
to
melt
in
the
bright
azure
from
the
darkening
sky
emerging
slow
and
silent
sheds
around
her
snowy
light
that
with
the
day
last
dim
reflection
from
the
broad
translucid
lake
insensibly
commingles
and
unites
in
sweetest
harmony
all
the
scene
diffusing
magic
tints
enchanting
power
how
lovely
every
object
now
appears
each
in
itself
and
how
they
all
combine
in
one
delightful
whole
what
eye
what
heart
o
nature
can
resist
thy
potent
charms
when
thus
in
soft
transparent
shade
now
beauty
and
sublimity
methinks
upon
the
lap
of
eve
embracing
sleep
mark
the
my
love
of
yonder
wood
whose
moonlight
foliage
fluctuates
in
the
breeze
say
do
they
not
in
figure
motion
hue
resemble
the
at
misty
dawn
what
shadowy
shape
along
the
troubled
lake
comes
this
way
moving
how
mysteriously
it
glides
along
how
indistinct
its
form
imagination
views
with
sweet
surprise
the
unknown
appearance
breathless
in
suspense
the
spirit
of
the
waters
can
it
be
on
his
aerial
car
some
fairy
power
pants
not
thy
heart
louisa
it
grows
upon
the
sight
strange
watery
sounds
attend
its
course
hark
was
not
that
a
voice
o
is
a
its
sails
and
oars
i
now
discern
the
strikes
how
loud
burst
forth
its
sound
into
the
startled
air
that
feels
it
still
and
trembles
far
around
my
dearest
love
it
summons
us
away
the
dew
begins
to
fall
let
us
depart
how
sweetly
have
we
spent
this
prologue
the
piece
is
of
peculiar
kind
for
which
the
appropriate
name
is
hard
to
find
no
comedy
is
clear
nor
can
it
be
with
strictest
truth
pronounced
a
tragedy
since
though
predominant
the
tragic
tone
it
reigns
not
uniformly
and
alone
then
that
its
character
be
best
proclaim
a
let
the
piece
be
named
but
do
not
critics
rashly
hence
conclude
is
a
mere
farce
incongruous
and
rude
where
incidents
in
strange
confusion
blend
without
connexion
interest
or
end
not
so
far
different
was
the
bard
design
for
though
at
times
he
ventures
to
combine
with
grave
melpomene
impassion
strain
the
gay
thalia
more
enlivening
vein
as
all
mankind
with
one
consent
agree
how
strong
the
charms
of
sweet
variety
yet
reason
path
he
still
with
care
observes
and
from
taste
with
wilful
blindness
swerves
his
plot
conducting
by
the
rules
of
art
and
above
all
he
strives
to
touch
the
heart
knowing
that
void
of
pathos
and
of
fire
art
reason
taste
are
vain
and
quickly
tire
be
mindful
then
ye
critics
of
the
intent
the
poet
means
not
here
to
represent
the
tragic
muse
in
all
her
terrors
drest
with
might
tempestuous
to
convulse
the
breast
nor
in
her
statelier
unrelaxing
mien
to
stalk
in
buskin
pomp
through
every
scene
but
with
an
air
more
mild
and
versatile
where
fear
and
grief
sometimes
admit
a
smile
now
loftier
humbler
now
the
changing
style
resembling
in
effect
an
when
from
the
clouds
by
fits
the
moon
throws
forth
her
light
and
louder
winds
by
turns
their
rage
appease
succeeded
by
the
breeze
but
in
few
words
our
author
ends
his
plea
already
tending
to
prolixity
to
paint
from
nature
was
his
leading
aim
let
then
the
play
your
candid
hearing
claim
judge
it
impartial
by
dramatic
laws
if

deserved
applause

stop
the
whirligig
his
hand
to
his
and
tell
my
story
though
is
so
strange
that
i
a
it
may
by
some
perhaps
be
judged
a
fiction
learn
gentle
audience
then
with
just
surprise
that
when
you
saw
the
curtain
rise
our
poet
epilogue
was
still
unwrit
the
devil
take
him
for
neglecting
it
nay
though
was
not
neglected
was
from
certain
motives
which
were
most
absurd
for
trusting
blindly
to
his
rhyming
vein
and
inventiveness
of
brain
he
form
the
whimsical
foolhardy
plan
to
set
about
it
when
the
play
began
thus
purposing
the

his

i
kind

by

alack
to

what

and
therefore
as
you
naturally
suppose
could
not
forbear
at
times
to
cock
my
nose
over
his
shoulder
curiously
to

his
progress

will
england
ever
boast
her
milton
name
the
poet
matchless
in
sublimity
now
in
memory
raptured
ear
resound
the
strains
of
the
miltonic
lyre
inspiring
virtuous
thought
they
breathe
of
heaven
the
imaginative
power
no
longer
treads
the
world
but
soars
aloft
and
draws
empyreal
air
rapt
faith
anticipates
the
when
at
the
archangel
call
the
dead
shall
wake
with
frames
resuscitated
glorified
then
then
in
strains
like
these
the
sainted
bard
conspicuous
mid
salvation
heirs
shall
join
harmoniously
the
heavenly
choir
and
sing
the
saviour
praise
in
endless
bliss
anacreontic
still
as
the
fleeting
seasons
change
from
joy
to
joy
poor
mortals
range
and
as
the
year
pursues
its
round
one
pleasure
lost
another
found
time
urging
on
his
envious
course
still
drives
them
from
their
last
resource
so
butterflies
when
children
chase
the
gaudy
prize
with
eager
pace
on
each
fresh
flower
but
just
alight
and
ere
they
taste
renew
their
flight
thanks
to
kind
fortune
i
possess
a
constant
source
of
happiness
and
am
not
poorly
forced
to
live
on
what
the

please
to
give
let
clouds
or

vest
the

what

i
while
i
quaff
the

i
can
defy
the

no

if

my

anacreontic
let
us
my

our
mirth
forbear
while
yonder
censor
mounts
the

his

erect
his
stately
pace
his
huge
white

his
solemn

his
scowling

his

severe
his
haughty
sneer
some
high
philosopher
declare
hush
let
us
hear
him
from
the

giddy
youths
i
hate
your
mirth
how
sons
of
earth
know
ye
not
well
the
fate
of
man
that
death
is
certain
life
a
span
that
merriment
soon
sinks
in
sorrow
sunshine
and
clouds
hearken
then
fools
to
reason
voice
that
bids
ye
mourn
and
not
rejoice
such
gloomy
thoughts
grave
sage
are
thine
now
gentle
friends
attend
to
mine
since
mortals
must
die
since
life
but
a
span
is
wisdom
say
i
to
live
while
we
can
and
fill
up
with
pleasure
the
poor
little
measure
of
fate
to
complain
how
simple
and
vain
long
faces
i
hate
they
shorten
the
date
my
friends
while
ye
may
be
jovial
the
things
that
will

to
foresee
or
should
ye
employ
your

on
let
hope
sing
of

not
fear
croak
of

see
the

flies
so
no
more
now

drink

two

who
are
always
quarrelling
pale

is

ever
jar

like

between

on
that
dark
theme
man
genealogy
how
strangely
people
notions

sir
growling
swears
that
he
can
trace
strong
kindred
likeness
to
the
my
lady
graceful
smiles
to
find
far
more
resemblance
to
the
sure
the
reflection
from
their
into
their
minds

prompt
opinion
passes
philosophers
have
tried
to
scan
the
pedigree
of
that
odd
creature

are
of
sir
cries
your
strange
assertion
strikes
me
with
surprise
i
for
my
part
the
compliment
decline
but
do
you
sir
sincerely
thus
opine
do
indeed
nay
more
i
sure
is
true
possible
yet
when
i
look
on
you
i
verily
begin
to
think
so
too
doctor
i
had
such
a
headache
so
bad
i
was
fearful
i
should
have
gone
out
of
my
senses
i
should
not
have
wonder
dear
if
you
had
you
not
have
to
go
far
to
leap
over
those
fences
on
the
conduct
of
some
few
clergymen
who
are
a
disgrace
to
their
sacred
profession
satan
says
scripture
like
a
roaring
lion
goes
about
seeking
whom
he
may
devour
what
should
a
priest
then
chiefly
keep
his
eye
on
to
guard
his
flock
against
the
tempter
pshaw
what
he
chiefly
looks
at
is
to
fleece
to
seize
his
prey
the
tithes
and
still
increase
like
a
devouring
lion
is
the
priest
or
give
the
devil
his
due
you
own
at
least
he
has
the
marks
about
him
of
the
beast
why
sir
so
proud
to
sign
your
name
means
i
member
of
the
faculty
hum
from
your
practice
else
one
might
infer
it
meant
or
death
minister
on
the
march
of
intellect
on
march
swiftly
on
the
people
cry
let
us
pursue
truth
knowledge
liberty
march
not
so
fast
my
friends
or
you
will
find
that
in
your
haste
you
left
them
all
behind
one
day
maria
that
belle
challenged
her
beau
to
play
at
bagatelle
shall
we
play
for
edwin
quickly
cried
you
please
the
smiling
girl
replied
for
a
kiss
fair
lady
we
will
play
he
wins
the
game
and
straight
demands
his
pay
no
i
wont
shall
i
wont
be
kiss
i
pay
you
with
a
check
if
you
persist
on
hearing
boast
that
he
could
translate
virgil
thou
able
boaster
virgil
to
translate
thou
then
be
so
vain
so
to
a
far
higher
intellectual
state
coxcomb
thou
must
thyself
be

translated
a
lady
had
a
sickly
son
a
skeleton
but
for
his
skin
her
pretty
maid
he
woo
and
won
the
mother
chid
him
for
his
charms
were
not
to
be
withstood
too
tempting
for
frail
flesh
and
blood
as
you
dear
must
fairly
own
that
no
excuse
for
skin
and
bone
on
a
mere
pretender
to
medical
science
officiously
offering
me
his
services
you
be
unwell
send
directly
for
me
to
cure
you
i
haste
with
all
possible
speed
prescribe
and
find
medicine
without
any
fee
oh
doctor
your
offer
most
generous
indeed
i
accept
but
for
something
the
vast
obligation
for
what
pray
the
instinct
of
if
as
swift
says
in
the
most
delicate
mind
nastiest
ideas
we
are
sure
to
find
then
equal
to
his
humour
and
his
wit
swift
delicacy
we
must
all
admit
on
hearing
a
parson
read
very
badly
a
sermon
he
had
bought
that
sermon
reverend
sir
which
you
have
bought
to
save
your
idle
brain
the
toil
of
thought
you
read
in
such
a
dull
lethargic
tone
it
seems
almost
as
stupid
as
your
own
pursefull
a
stickler
for
the
law
abuse
to
him
is
clear
it
was
of
sterling
use
pursefull
still
advocates
the
law
what
moralist
can
gratitude
condemn
they
formerly
have
done
so
much
for
him
ought
he
not
now
to
do
his
best
for
them
to
mr
bury
an
eminent
surgeon
in
coventry
on
his
having
performed
a
successful
operation
in
a
case
of
inflammation
in
the
neck
when
the
patient
was
in
extreme
danger
of
immediate
suffocation
bury
for
practice
bold
and
skill
deserves
to
be
of
note
he
cures
by
means
that
well
might
kill
he
cuts
his
patient
throat
when
satan
tempts
a
priest
to
rise
is
the
call
of
heaven
he
cries
and
mount
ambition
ladder
to
heaven
own
call
that
bids
him
be
like
christ
full
of
humility
