and
they
descry
what
was
done
by
wicked

and
like
frogs
they
dove
where
the
poor
young

as
if
nothing

paul
and
peter
in
their
chamber
lay
there
wrapt
in
peaceful
slumber
a
soft
snoring
through
their
noses
shows
how
tranquilly
each
dozes
but
not
so

with

with
those

brings

with
mingling
joy

she
smiled

worse
than
having
ten
teeth

he
casts
askance
at
that
youthful
pair
a
glance
seeming
plainly
to
confess
i
no

plish
and
plum
their
deeds
declare
are
a
graceless
pair
yet
they
live
in
close
communion
and
for
that
in
my
opinion
they
deserve
some
commendation
but
will
be
of
long
duration
rogue
such
firm
be
sure
can
not
many
days
endure
in
the
sunshine
sits
a
fair
to
see
to
our
pair
this
lovely
sight
is
a
rare
and
keen
delight
each
would
gain
the
foremost
place
to
behold
that
beauteous
face
if
the
front
is
gained
by
plish
plum
looks
glum
and
dismalish
then
if
it
is
seized
by
plum
that
makes
plish
exceeding
glum
soon
thunders
growl

scratch

eyeballs
roll
and
the
furious
fight
begins
plum
cuts
dirt
his
brother
wins
mamma
fittig
stands
and
makes
chicken
salad
and
pancakes
those
well
known
and
favorite
dishes

devoutly
wishes

right
through

mingle
in

grand
ragout
wait
you
vile
plish
peter
holloos
and
the
word
instanter
follows
with
a
blow
but
paul
does
relish
that
at
all
what
d
ye
mean
to
strike
my
creatur
cries
out
paul
and
lashes
peter
who
inflamed
with
pain
and
passion
winds
up
paul
in
curious
fashion
now
the
battle
desperate
grows
each
the
costly
salad
throws
in
a
frenzy
at
his
brother
and
they

heavy

old

finds
i
guess
the
pancake

bad
said
sly
as
bad
can
be
and
this
once
too
bad
for
me
chapter
vii
so
now
there
sit
plish
and
plum
very
dull
and
very
glum
two
strong
chains
and
short
did
hem
the
activity
of
them
fittig
seriously
reflected
this
must
somehow
be
corrected
virtue
needs
encouragement
vice
gets
on
by
natural
bent
paul
and
peter
now
began
schooling
with
herr
buckleman
at
the
first
day
session
he
thus
addressed
them
pleasantly
dear
lads
i
assure
you
i
am
very
glad
you
have
come
to
this
seminary
and
as
i
hope
with
all
your
powers
intend
to
improve
these
precious
hours
and
first
the
things
most
important
to
mention
reading
writing
and
ciphering
will
claim
our
attention
for
these
are
the
arts
by
which
man
rises
to
honor
and
wealth
and
wins
great
prizes
but
secondly
what
good
would
all
this
do
unless
politeness
were
added
thereto
for
he
who
is
not
polite
to
all
into
trouble
will
certainly
fall
finally
therefore
bending
before
you
as
you
see
i
entreat
and
implore
you
if
in
good
faith
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
follow
the
rules
i
have
now
defined
then
lift
up
your
hands
and
look
me
in
the
eye
and
say
buckleman
we
will
try
paul
and
peter
thought
old
man
d
think
us
greenhorns
is
that
your
plan
they
give
no
answer
but
inwardly
they
grin
and
giggle
and
say
he
he
whereat
old
master
buckleman
gave
a
low
whistle
and
thus
began
since
then
you
resolved
to
be
hardened
reprobates
said
he
i
am
resolved
face
down
to
lay
you
both
across
my
desk
straightway
applying
the
stick
to
your
hinder
parts
in
hopes
of
softening
your
hard
hearts
drawing
out
then
from
beneath
his
coat
like
sabre
from
its
sheath
his
good
hazel
rod
of
stuff
flexible
and
tight
and
tough
he
with
many
a
sturdy
thwack
laid
it
on
each
urchin
back
nay
he
trounced
two
backs
in
one
till
he
deemed
the
work
was
done
now
then
he
spoke
in
a
tranquil
way
belov√®d
children
what
do
you
say
are
you
content
and
are
we
agreed
yes
yes
herr
buckleman
yes
indeed
such
was
the
method
of
buckleman
we
see
the
good
effects
of
his
plan
was
the
talk
of
the
people
one
and
all
charming
children
peter
and
paul
and
so
tried
it
on
plish
and
plum
they
too
also
to
school
must
come
and
the
buckleman
plan
applied
faithfully
to
each
one
hide
masters
of
arts
they
soon
approved
and
universally
beloved
and
as
one
might
well
expect
art
shows
practical
effect
conclusion
one
day
travelling
through
the
land
with
a
in
his
hand
a
man
of
fortune
came
mister
peep
they
called
his
name
ca
i
as
i
pass
said
he
view
the
distant
scenery
beauty
reigns
elsewhere
i
know
whereas
here
is
but
here
he
pitched
into
the
pond
viewed
the
mud
and
naught
beyond
paul
and
peter
look
and
see
where
the
gentleman
can
be
so
said
fittig
who
just
then
walked
forth
with
the
little
men
but
soon
it
was
made
plain
where
the
gentleman
had
lain
when
he
minus
hat
and
glass
stood
all
dripping
on
the
grass
plish
and
plum
came
the
order
from
the
shore
strictly
trained
to
fetch
and
carry
not
a
moment
did
they
tarry
fetched
the
lost
goods
from
the
deep
very
well
cried
mister
peep
nice
dogs
friend
i
buy
the
two
how
a
hundred
dollars
do
papa
fittig
head
inclined
the
gentleman
is
very
kind
on
new
legs
he
seems
to
stand
such
a
pile
of
cash
in
hand
ah
you
darlings
plish
and
plum
we
must
part
the
hour
has
come
on
this
very
spot
right
here
where
we
four
this
time
last
year
were
united
by
the
pond
in
a
sweet
and
solemn
bond
may
your
life
in
peace
be
led
with
beefsteak
for
daily
bread
now
all
this
was
seen
by
sly
just
then
happening
to
pass
by
very
pleasant
mutters
he
yes
no
doubt
but
not
for
me
envy
like
a
poisoned
dart
stung
him
to
the
very
heart
all
before
him
misty
grows
legs
give
way
and
back
he
goes
down
into
the
oozy
damp
quenched
forever
is
life
lamp
left
alone
upon
the
shore
quickened
by
his
breath
no
more
faintly
gleams
the
expiring
soul
of
the
pipe
within
the
bowl

tale
