preface
i
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
and
the
first
fifteen
years
of
the
twentieth
century
have
been
a
period
of
research
of
experiment
of
unrest
and
questioning
in
science
and
philosophy
we
have
witnessed
an
attempt
to
destroy
the
mechanistic
theory
of
the
universe
as
developed
by
darwin
huxley
and
spencer
the
unknowable
has
been
questioned
hypotheses
have
been
shaken
vitalism
and
idealism
have
been
proclaimed
in
the
arts
the
tendency
has
been
to
strip
each
art
of
its
inessentials
and
to
disclose
the
underlying
basis
of
pure
form
in
life
the
principles
of
nationality
of
racial
culture
of
individualism
of
social
development
of
christian
ethics
have
been
discussed
debated
and
examined
from
top
to
bottom
until
at
last
in
the
early
years
of
the
twentieth
century
we
find
all
europe
from
the
leaders
of
thought
down
to
the
lowest
peasantry
engaged
in
a
mutually
destructive
war
of
which
few
can
trace
the
beginnings
and
none
can
foresee
the
end
the
fundamental
tenets
of
thought
art
life
itself
have
been
shaken
and
either
civilization
is
destined
to
some
new
birth
or
mankind
will
revert
to
the
conditions
of
life
thought
and
social
intercourse
that
prevailed
in
the
stone
age
like
all
men
of
my
generation
i
have
not
been
able
to
resist
this
irresistible
upheaval
of
ideas
and
of
forces
and
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
have
tried
to
arrive
at
a
clear
understanding
of
the
fundamentals
of
æsthetic
form
as
they
affect
the
art
to
which
i
have
felt
myself
instinctively
akin
the
art
of
poetry
that
i
have
completely
attained
such
an
understanding
it
would
be
idle
for
me
to
pretend
but
i
believe
and
have
induced
some
others
to
believe
that
i
have
made
a
few
steps
towards
it
some
explanation
of
my
own
peculiar
theories
and
beliefs
is
necessary
however
to
those
who
have
not
specifically
concerned
themselves
with
poetry
or
who
suffer
in
the
presence
of
any
new
work
of
art
from
the
normal
human
reaction
that
all
art
principles
are
so
essentially
fixed
that
any
departure
from
accepted
ideas
is
madness
ii
the
fundamental
basis
of
all
the
arts
is
the
same
in
every
case
art
aims
at
the
evocation
of
some
human
emotion
in
the
spectator
or
listener
where
science
proceeds
from
effects
to
causes
and
seeks
to
analyze
the
underlying
causes
of
emotion
and
sensation
art
reverses
the
process
and
constructs
something
that
will
awaken
emotions
according
to
the
amount
of
receptiveness
with
which
other
people
approach
it
thus
architecture
gives
us
feelings
of
density
proportion
harmony
sculpture
of
masses
in
movement
painting
of
and
the
ordered
composition
of
lines
and
volumes
from
which
arise
sensations
of
space
music
of
the
development
of
sounds
into
melodic
line
harmonic
progression
tonal
opposition
and
symphonic
structure
the
object
of
literature
is
not
dissimilar
from
these
literature
aims
at
releasing
the
emotions
that
arise
from
the
formed
words
of
a
certain
language
but
literature
is
probably
a
less
pure
and
hence
more
universal
art
than
any
i
have
yet
examined
for
it
must
be
apparent
to
all
minds
that
not
only
is
a
word
a
definite
symbol
of
some
fact
but
also
it
is
a
thing
capable
of
being
spoken
or
sounded
the
art
of
literature
then
in
so
far
as
it
deals
with
definite
statements
is
akin
to
painting
or
photography
in
so
far
as
it
deals
with
sounded
words
it
is
akin
to
music
iii
literature
therefore
does
not
depend
on
the
peculiar
twists
and
quirks
which
represent
to
those
who
can
read
the
words
but
rather
on
the
essential
words
themselves
in
fact
literature
existed
before
writing
and
writing
in
itself
is
of
no
value
from
the
purely
literary
sense
except
in
so
far
as
it
preserves
and
transmits
from
generation
to
generation
the
literary
emotion
style
whether
in
prose
or
poetry
is
an
attempt
to
develop
this
essentially
musical
quality
of
literature
to
evoke
the
magic
that
exists
in
the
of
words
as
well
as
to
combine
these
in
definite
statements
or
sentences
the
difference
between
prose
and
poetry
is
therefore
not
a
difference
of
means
but
of
psychological
effect
and
reaction
the
means
employed
the
formed
language
is
the
same
but
the
resultant
impression
is
quite
different
in
prose
the
emotions
expressed
are
those
that
are
capable
of
development
in
a
straight
line
in
so
far
as
prose
is
pure
it
confines
itself
to
the
direct
orderly
progression
of
a
thought
or
conception
or
situation
from
point
to
point
of
a
flat
surface
the
sentences
as
they
develop
this
conception
from
its
beginning
to
conclusion
move
on
and
do
not
return
upon
themselves
the
grouping
of
these
sentences
into
paragraphs
gives
the
breadth
of
the
thought
the
paragraphs
sections
and
chapters
are
each
a
square
in
that
they
represent
a
division
of
the
main
thought
into
parallel
units
or
blocks
of
subsidiary
ideas
the
sensation
of
depth
is
finally
obtained
by
arranging
these
blocks
in
a
rising
climacteric
progression
or
in
parallel
lines
or
in
a
sort
of
zigzag
figure
the
psychological
reaction
that
arises
from
the
intelligent
appreciation
of
poetry
is
quite
different
in
poetry
we
have
a
succession
of
curves
the
direction
of
the
thought
is
not
in
straight
lines
but
wavy
and
spiral
it
rises
and
falls
on
gusts
of
strong
emotion
most
often
it
creates
strongly
marked
loops
and
circles
the
structure
of
the
stanza
or
strophe
always
tends
to
the
spherical
depth
is
obtained
by
making
one
sphere
contain
a
number
of
concentric
or
overlapping
spheres
hence
when
we
speak
of
poetry
we
usually
mean
regular
rhyme
and
metre
which
have
for
so
long
been
considered
essential
to
all
poetry
not
as
a
device
for
heightening
musical
effect
as
so
many
people
suppose
but
merely
to
make
these
loops
and
circles
more
accentuated
and
to
make
the
line
of
the
poem
turn
upon
itself
more
recognizably
but
it
must
be
recognized
that
just
as
giotto
circle
was
none
the
less
a
circle
although
not
drawn
with
compasses
so
poetic
circles
can
be
constructed
out
of
subtler
and
more
musical
curves
than
that
which
painstakingly
follows
the
selfsame
progression
of
beats
and
catches
itself
up
on
the
same
point
of
rhyme
for
line
after
line
the
key
pattern
on
the
lip
of
a
greek
vase
may
be
beautiful
but
it
is
less
beautiful
less
satisfying
and
less
conclusive
a
test
of
artistic
ability
than
the
composition
of
satyrs
and
of
mænads
struggling
about
the
centre
therefore
i
maintain
and
will
continue
to
do
so
that
the
mere
to
write
in
regular
lines
and
metres
no
more
makes
a
man
a
poet
than
the
ability
to
stencil
makes
him
a
painter
rather
is
it
more
important
to
observe
that
almost
any
prose
work
of
imaginative
literature
if
examined
closely
will
be
found
to
contain
a
plentiful
sprinkling
of
excellent
verses
while
many
poems
which
the
world
hails
as
contain
whole
pages
of
prose
the
fact
is
that
prose
and
poetry
are
to
literature
as
composition
and
colour
are
to
painting
or
as
light
and
shadow
to
the
day
or
male
and
female
to
mankind
there
are
no
absolutely
perfect
poets
and
no
absolutely
perfect
each
partakes
of
some
of
the
characteristics
of
the
other
the
difference
between
poetry
and
prose
is
therefore
a
difference
between
a
general
roundness
and
a
general
squareness
of
outline
a
great
french
critic
recently
dead
who
devoted
perhaps
the
major
part
of
his
life
to
the
study
of
the
æsthetics
of
the
french
tongue
declared
that
flaubert
and
chateaubriand
wrote
only
poetry
if
there
are
those
who
can
not
see
that
in
the
only
true
and
lasting
sense
of
the
word
poetry
this
remark
was
perfectly
just
then
all
i
have
written
above
will
be
in
vain
iv
along
with
the
prevailing
preoccupation
with
technique
which
so
marks
the
early
twentieth
century
there
has
gone
also
a
great
change
in
the
of
art
having
tried
to
explain
the
aesthetic
of
poetry
i
shall
now
attempt
to
explain
my
personal
way
of
viewing
its
content
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
every
change
in
technical
procedure
in
the
arts
is
accompanied
by
and
grows
out
of
a
change
in
to
take
only
one
out
of
innumerable
examples
the
new
of
wagner
of
an
immeasurably
higher
order
than
the
usual
libretto
created
a
new
form
of
music
based
on
motifs
not
melodies
other
examples
can
easily
be
discovered
the
reason
for
this
is
not
difficult
to
find
no
sincere
artist
cares
to
handle
that
has
already
been
handled
and
exhausted
it
is
not
a
question
of
a
desire
to
avoid
plagiarism
or
of
searching
for
novelty
but
of
a
perfectly
spontaneous
and
normal
appeal
which
any
new
always
makes
hence
when
a
new
subject
appears
to
any
artist
he
always
realizes
it
more
vividly
than
an
old
one
and
if
he
is
a
good
artist
he
realizes
it
so
vividly
that
he
recreates
it
in
what
is
practically
a
novel
form
this
novel
form
never
is
altogether
novel
nor
is
the
subject
altogether
a
new
subject
for
as
i
pointed
out
at
the
beginning
of
this
preface
that
all
arts
sprang
practically
out
of
the
same
primary
sensations
so
the
of
all
art
must
forever
be
the
same
namely
nature
and
human
life
hence
any
new
type
of
art
will
always
be
found
in
as
well
as
in
technique
to
have
its
roots
in
the
old
art
is
like
a
kaleidoscope
capable
of
many
changes
while
the
material
which
builds
up
those
changes
remains
the
same
nevertheless
although
the
in
this
book
is
not
altogether
new
yet
i
have
realized
it
in
a
way
which
has
not
often
been
tried
and
out
of
that
fresh
and
quite
personal
realization
have
sprung
my
innovations
in
subject
as
well
as
technique
let
me
illustrate
by
a
concrete
example
v
a
book
lies
on
my
desk
it
has
a
red
binding
and
is
badly
printed
on
cheap
paper
i
have
had
this
book
with
me
for
several
years
now
suppose
i
were
to
write
a
poem
on
this
book
how
would
i
treat
the
subject
if
i
were
a
poet
following
in
the
main
the
victorian
tradition
i
should
write
my
poem
altogether
about
the
contents
of
this
book
and
its
author
my
poem
would
be
essentially
a
criticism
of
the
of
the
book
i
should
state
at
length
how
that
had
affected
me
in
short
what
the
reader
would
obtain
from
this
sort
of
poem
would
be
my
sentimental
reaction
towards
certain
ideas
and
tendencies
in
the
work
of
another
if
i
were
a
realist
poet
i
should
write
about
the
book
external
appearance
i
should
expatiate
on
the
red
binding
the
bad
type
the
on
page
sixteen
i
should
complain
perhaps
of
my
poverty
at
not
being
able
to
buy
a
better
edition
and
conclude
with
a
gibe
at
the
author
for
not
having
realized
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
neither
of
these
ways
however
of
writing
about
this
book
possesses
any
novelty
and
neither
is
essentially
my
own
way
my
own
way
of
writing
about
it
would
be
as
follows
i
should
select
out
of
my
life
the
important
events
connected
with
my
ownership
of
this
book
and
strive
to
write
of
them
in
terms
of
the
volume
itself
both
as
regards
and
appearance
in
other
words
i
should
link
up
my
personality
and
the
personality
of
the
book
and
make
each
a
part
of
the
other
in
this
way
i
should
strive
to
evoke
a
soul
out
of
this
piece
of
inanimate
matter
a
something
characteristic
and
structural
inherent
in
this
form
which
is
friendly
to
me
and
responds
to
my
mood
this
method
is
not
new
although
it
has
not
often
been
used
in
occidental
countries
professor
fenollosa
in
his
book
on
chinese
and
japanese
art
states
that
it
was
universally
employed
by
the
chinese
artists
and
poets
of
the
sung
period
in
the
eleventh
century
he
calls
this
doctrine
of
the
interdependence
of
man
and
inanimate
nature
the
cardinal
doctrine
of
zen
buddhism
the
zen
buddhists
evolved
it
from
the
still
earlier
taoist
philosophy
which
undoubtedly
inspired
li
po
and
the
other
great
chinese
poets
of
the
seventh
and
eighth
centuries
vi
in
the
first
poems
of
this
volume
the
ghosts
of
an
old
house
i
have
followed
the
method
already
described
i
have
tried
to
evoke
out
of
the
furniture
and
surroundings
of
a
certain
old
house
definite
emotions
which
i
have
had
concerning
them
i
have
tried
to
relate
my
childish
terror
concerning
this
house
a
terror
not
uncommon
among
children
as
i
can
testify
to
the
aspects
that
called
it
forth
in
the
symphonies
which
form
the
second
part
of
this
volume
i
have
gone
a
step
further
my
aim
in
writing
these
was
from
the
beginning
to
narrate
certain
important
phases
of
the
emotional
and
intellectual
development
in
short
the
life
of
an
artist
not
necessarily
myself
but
of
that
sort
of
artist
with
which
i
might
find
myself
most
in
sympathy
and
here
not
being
restrained
by
any
definite
material
phenomena
as
in
the
old
house
i
have
tried
to
state
each
phase
in
the
terms
of
a
certain
colour
or
combination
of
colours
which
is
emotionally
akin
to
that
phase
this
colour
and
the
imaginative
phantasmagoria
of
landscape
which
it
evokes
thereby
creates
in
a
definite
and
tangible
form
the
dominant
mood
of
each
poem
the
emotional
relations
that
exist
between
form
colour
and
sound
have
been
little
investigated
it
is
perfectly
true
that
certain
colours
affect
certain
temperaments
differently
but
it
is
also
true
that
there
is
a
science
of
colour
and
that
certain
of
its
laws
are
already
universally
known
if
not
explained
naturally
enough
it
is
to
the
painters
we
must
first
turn
if
we
want
to
find
out
what
is
known
about
colour
we
discover
that
painters
continually
are
speaking
of
hot
and
cold
colour
red
yellow
orange
being
generally
hot
and
green
blue
and
violet
cold
mixed
colours
being
classed
hot
and
cold
according
to
the
proportions
they
contain
of
the
hot
and
cold
colours
we
also
discover
that
certain
colours
will
not
fit
certain
forms
but
rebel
at
the
combination
this
is
so
far
true
that
scarcely
any
landscape
painter
finishes
his
pictures
from
nature
but
in
the
studio
and
almost
any
art
student
painting
a
landscape
will
disregard
the
colour
before
him
and
employ
the
of
his
master
or
of
some
painter
he
admires
as
delacroix
noted
in
his
journal
a
conception
having
become
a
composition
must
move
in
the
milieu
of
a
colour
peculiar
to
it
there
seems
to
be
a
particular
tone
belonging
to
some
part
of
every
picture
which
is
a
key
that
governs
all
the
other
tones
therefore
we
must
admit
that
there
is
an
intimate
relation
between
colour
and
form
it
is
the
same
with
colour
and
sounds
many
musicians
have
observed
the
phenomenon
that
when
certain
notes
or
combinations
of
them
are
sounded
certain
colours
are
also
suggested
to
the
eye
a
russian
composer
scriabine
went
so
far
as
to
construct
and
an
english
scientist
professor
wallace
rimington
has
built
an
organ
which
plays
in
colours
instead
of
notes
unfortunately
the
musicians
have
given
this
subject
less
attention
than
the
painters
and
therefore
our
knowledge
concerning
the
relations
of
colour
and
sound
is
more
fragmentary
and
incomplete
nevertheless
these
relations
exist
and
it
is
for
the
future
to
develop
them
more
fully
literature
and
especially
poetry
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
partakes
of
the
character
of
both
painting
and
music
the
impressionist
method
is
quite
as
applicable
to
writing
as
it
is
to
landscape
poems
can
be
written
in
major
or
minor
keys
can
be
as
full
of
dominant
motif
as
a
wagner
and
even
susceptible
of
fugal
treatment
literature
is
the
common
ground
of
many
arts
and
in
its
highest
development
such
as
the
drama
as
practised
in
athens
is
found
allied
to
music
dancing
and
colour
hence
i
have
called
my
works
symphonies
when
they
are
really
dramas
of
the
soul
and
hence
in
them
i
have
used
colour
for
verity
for
ornament
for
drama
for
its
inherent
beauty
and
for
intensifying
the
form
of
the
emotion
that
each
of
these
poems
is
intended
to
evoke
vii
let
us
take
an
artist
a
young
man
at
the
outset
of
his
career
his
years
of
searching
of
fumbling
of
other
men
influence
are
coming
to
an
end
sure
of
himself
he
yet
sees
that
he
will
spend
all
his
life
pursuing
a
vision
of
beauty
which
will
elude
him
at
the
very
last
this
is
the
first
symphony
which
i
have
called
the
blue
because
blue
suggests
to
me
depth
mystery
and
distance
he
finds
himself
alone
in
a
great
city
surrounded
by
noise
and
clamour
it
is
as
if
millions
of
lives
were
tugging
at
him
drawing
him
away
from
his
art
tempting
him
to
go
out
and
whelm
his
personality
in
this
black
whirlpool
of
struggle
and
failure
on
which
float
golden
specks
the
illusory
bliss
of
life
but
he
sees
that
all
this
is
only
another
illusion
like
his
own
here
we
have
the
symphony
in
black
and
gold
he
emerges
from
the
city
and
in
the
country
is
with
desire
for
life
by
spring
he
vows
himself
to
a
pagan
worship
of
nature
this
is
the
green
symphony
quickened
by
spring
he
dreams
of
a
marvellous
golden
city
of
art
fall
of
this
city
appears
to
him
at
times
like
some
italian
town
of
the
renaissance
at
others
like
some
strange
oriental
he
sees
himself
dead
in
the
desert
far
away
from
it
yet
its
blossoming
is
ever
about
him
something
divine
has
been
born
of
him
after
death
so
he
passes
to
the
white
symphony
the
central
poem
of
this
series
in
which
i
have
sought
to
describe
the
artist
struggle
to
attain
unutterable
and
superhuman
perfection
this
struggle
goes
on
from
the
midsummer
of
his
life
to
midwinter
the
end
of
it
is
stated
in
the
poem
there
follows
a
brief
interlude
which
i
have
called
a
symphony
in
white
and
blue
these
colours
were
chosen
perhaps
more
idiosyncratically
in
this
case
than
in
the
others
i
have
tried
to
depict
the
sort
of
temptation
that
besets
most
artists
at
this
stage
of
their
career
the
temptation
to
abandon
the
struggle
for
the
sake
of
a
purely
sensual
existence
in
this
case
however
the
appeal
of
sensuality
is
conveyed
under
the
guise
of
a
dream
it
is
resisted
and
the
struggle
begins
anew
war
breaks
out
not
alone
in
the
external
world
but
in
the
soul
he
finds
he
must
follow
his
personality
wherever
it
leads
him
despite
all
obstacles
this
is
the
orange
symphony
now
follow
long
years
of
struggle
and
neglect
he
is
shipwrecked
and
still
afar
he
sees
his
city
of
art
but
this
time
it
is
red
a
phantom
mocking
his
impotent
rage
old
age
follows
all
is
violet
the
colour
of
regret
and
remembrance
he
is
living
only
in
the
past
his
life
a
succession
of
dreams
lastly
all
things
fade
out
into
absolute
grey
and
it
is
now
midwinter
looking
forth
on
the
world
again
he
still
sees
war
like
a
monstrous
red
flower
dominating
mankind
he
hears
the
souls
of
the
dead
declaring
that
they
too
have
died
for
an
adventure
even
as
he
is
about
to
die

in
the
briefest
possible
analysis

as
if

there

circular

going
up
to
the

a
wooden
lid
covers
it
all
over

is

feeling
something
big
and
angry

me
on

some
one
dug

and
brought
it
to
our
house
in
the
dark
upper
hall
i
see
it
dimly
looking
at
me
through
the
glass
where
dancers
have
danced
and
weary
people
have
crept
to
their
bedrooms
in
the
morning
where
sick
people
have
tossed
all

where
children
have
been
born
where
feet
have
gone
up

down

anger
has
blazed
forth
and
strange
looks
have

old
nursery
in
the
tired
face
of
the
mirror
there
is
a
blue
curtain
reflected
if
i
could
lift
the
reflection
peer
a
little
beyond
i
would
see
a
boy
crying
because
his
sister
is
ill
in
another
room
and
he
has
no
one
to
play
with
a
boy
listlessly
scattering
building
blocks
and
crying
because
no
one
will
build
for
him
the
palace
of
fairy
morgana
i
can
not
lift
the
curtain
it
is
stiff
and
frozen
the
back
stairs
in
the
afternoon
when
no
one
is
in
the
house
i
suddenly
hear
dull
dragging
feet
go
fumbling
down
those
dark
back
stairs
that
climb
up
twisting
as
if
they
wanted
no
one
to
see
them
beating
a
dirge
upon
the
bare
planks
i
hear
those
feet
and
the
creak
of
a
door
my
mother
often
went
up
and
down
those
selfsame
stairs
from
the
room
where
by
the
window
she
would
sit
all
day
and
listlessly
look
on
the
world
that
had
destroyed
her
she
would
go
down
in
the
evening
to
the
room
where
she
would
sleep
or
rather
not
sleep
but
all
night
lie
staring
fiercely
at
the
ceiling
in
the
afternoon
when
no
one
is
in
the
house
i
suddenly
hear
dull
dragging
feet
beating
out
their
futile
tune
up
and
down
those
dark
back
stairs
but
there
is
no
one
in
the
shadows
the
wall
cabinet
above
the
steep
back
stairs
so
high
that
only
a
ladder
can
come
to
it
there
is
a
wall
cabinet
hidden
away
no
one
ever
unlocks
it
the
key
is
lost
the
door
is
barred
it
is
shut
and
still
some
say
a
previous
tenant
filled
its
shelves
with
rows
of
bottles
bottles
of
spirit
filled
with
spiders
i
do
not
know
above
the
sleepy
still
back
stairs
it
watches
shut
and
still
the
cellar
faintly
lit
by
a
grating
the
cellar
flattens
itself
under
the
house
in
one
corner
there
is
a
little
door
so
low
it
can
scarcely
be
seen
beyond
there
is
a
narrow
room
one
must
feel
for
the
walls
in
the
dark
one
shrinks
to
go
to
the
end
of
it
feeling
the
smooth
cold
wall
why
did
the
builders
who
made
this
house
stow
one
room
away
like
this
the
front
door
it
was
always
the
place
where
our
farewells
were
taken
when
we
travelled
to
the
north
i
remember
there
was
one
who
made
some
journey
but
did
not
come
back
many
years
they
waited
for
him
at
last
the
one
who
wished
the
most
to
see
him
was
carried
out
of
this
selfsame
door
in
death
since
then
all
our
family
partings
have
been
at
another
door
part
ii
the
attic
in
the
attic
dust
hangs
clogged
so
thick
the
air
has
a
dusty
taste
spider
threads
cling
to
my
face
from
the
broad
there
is
nothing
living
here
the
house
below
might
be
quite
empty
no
sound
comes
from
it
the
old
broken
trunks
and
boxes
cracked
and
dusty
pictures
legless
chairs
and
shattered
tables
seem
to
be
crying
softly
in
the
stillness
because
no
one
has
brushed
them
no
one
has
any
use
for
them
now
yet
i
often
wonder
if
these
things
are
really
dead
if
the
old
trunks
never
open
letting
out
grey
flapping
things
at
twilight
if
it
is
all
as
safe
and
dull
as
it
seems
why
then
is
the
stair
so
steep
why
is
the
doorway
always
locked
why
does
nobody
ever
come
the
calendar
in
the
attic
i
wonder
how
long
it
has
been
since
this
old
calendar
hung
here
with
my
birthday
date
upon
it
nothing
else
not
a
word
of
writing
not
a
mark
of
any
hand
perhaps
it
was
my
father
who
left
it
thus
for
me
to
see
perhaps
my
mother
smiled
as
she
saw
it
but
in
later
years
did
not
smile
if
i
could
tear
it
down
from
the
wall
somehow
i
would
be
content
but
i
am
afraid
as
a
little
child
to
touch
it
the
hoopskirt
in
the
night
when
all
are
sleeping
up
here
a
tiny
old
dame
comes
tripping
looking
for
her
lost
hoopskirt
my
i
never
saw
her
her
ghost
does
know
me
from
another
she
stalks
up
the
attic
stairs
angrily
the
dust
sets
her
sneezing
and
coughing
by
the
trunk
she
is
limping
and
hopping
but
alas
the
trunk
is
locked
what
an
old
dame
to
do
anyway
must
stay
in
a
mouldy
grave
day
on
day
or
go
to
heaven
out
of
style
in
the
night
when
all
are
snoring
the
old
lady
makes
a
dreadful
clatter
going
down
the
attic
stairs
what
was
that
a
ghost
or
a
burglar
oh
it
was
only
the
wind
in
the
chimney
yes
and
the
attic
door
that
slammed
the
little
chair
i
know
not
why
when
i
saw
the
little
chair
i
suddenly
desired
to
sit
in
it
i
know
not
why
when
i
sat
in
the
little
chair
everything
changed
and
life
came
back
to
me
i
am
convinced
no
one
at
all
has
grown
up
in
the
house
the
break
that
i
dreamed
itself
was
a
dream
and
is
broken
i
will
sit
in
the
little
chair
and
wait
till
the
others
come
looking
after
me
and
if
it
is
after
nightfall
they
will
come
so
much
the
better
for
the
little
chair
holds
me
as
tightly
as
death
and
rocking
in
it
i
can
hear
it
whisper
strange
things
in
the
dark
corner
i
brush
the
dust
from
this
old
portrait
yes
it
is
the
same
face
exactly
why
does
it
look
at
me
still
with
such
a
look
of
hate
i
brush
the
dust
from
a
heap
of
magazines
here
there
is
all
what
you
have
written
all
that
you
struggled
long
years
and
went
down
to
darkness
for
o
god
to
think
what
i
am
writing
will
be
ever
as
this
o
god
to
think
that
my
own
face
may
some
day
glare
from
this
dust
the
toy
cabinet
by
the
old
toy
cabinet
i
stand
and
turn
over
dusty
things
chessmen
card
games
hoops
and
balls
toy
rifles
helmets
swords
in
the
far
corner
a
doll
in
a
box
where
are
you
golden
child
who
gave
tea
to
your
dolls
and
me
the
golden
child
is
growing
old
further
than
rome
or
babylon
from
you
have
passed
those
foolish
years
she
lives
she
suffers
she
forgets
by
the
old
toy
cabinet
i
idly
stand
and
awkwardly
finger
the
lock
of
the
box
what
matter
why
should
i
look
inside
perhaps
it
is
empty
after
all
leave
old
things
to
the
ghosts
of
old
my
stupid
brain
refuses
thought
i
am
maddened
with
a
desire
to
weep
the
yardstick
yardstick
that
measured
out
so
many
miles
of
cloth
yardstick
that
covered
me
i
wonder
do
you
hop
of
nights
out
to
the
still
and
up
and
down
go
measuring
a
clayey
grave
for
me
part
iii
the
lawn
the
three
oaks
there
are
three
ancient
oaks
that
grow
near
to
each
other
they
lift
their
branches
high
as
beckoning
with
outstretched
arms
for
some
one
to
come
and
stand
under
the
canopy
of
their
leaves
once
long
ago
i
remember
as
i
lay
in
the
very
centre
between
them
a
rotten
branch
suddenly
fell
near
to
me
i
will
not
go
back
to
those
oaks
their
branches
are
too
black
for
my
liking
an
oak
hoar
mistletoe
hangs
in
clumps
to
the
twisted
boughs
of
this
lonely
tree
beneath
its
roots
i
often
thought
treasure
was
buried
for
the
roots
had
enclosed
a
circle
but
when
i
dug
beneath
them
i
could
only
find
great
black
ants
that
attacked
my
hands
when
at
night
i
have
the
nightmare
i
always
see
the
eyes
of
ants
swarming
from
a
mouldering
box
of
gold
another
oak
poison
ivy
crawls
at
its
root
i
dare
not
approach
it
it
has
an
air
of
hate
one
would
say
a
man
had
been
hanged
to
its
branches
it
holds
them
in
such
a
way
the
moon
gets
tangled
in
it
a
distant
steeple
seems
to
bark
from
its
belfry
to
the
sky
something
that
no
one
ever
loved
is
buried
here
some
grey
shape
of
deadly
hate
crawls
on
the
back
fence
just
beyond
now
i
remember
once
i
went
out
by
night
too
near
this
oak
and
a
red
cat
suddenly
leapt
from
the
dark
and
clawed
my
face
the
old
barn
owls
flap
in
this
ancient
barn
with
rotted
doors
rats
squeak
in
this
ancient
barn
over
the
floors
owls
flap
warily
every
night
rats
eyes
gleam
in
the
cold
moonlight
there
is
something
hidden
in
this
barn
with
barred
doors
something
the
owls
have
torn
and
the
rats
scurry
with
over
the
floors
the
well
the
well
is
not
used
now
its
waters
are
tainted
i
remember
there
was
once
a
man
went
down
to
clean
it
he
found
it
very
cold
and
deep
with
a
queer
niche
in
one
of
its
sides
from
which
he
hauled
forth
buckets
of
bricks
and
dirt
the
trees
when
the
moonlight
strikes
the
the
trees
are
not
the
same
i
know
they
are
not
the
same
because
there
is
one
tree
that
is
missing
and
it
stood
so
long
by
another
that
the
other
feeling
lonely
now
is
slowly
dying
too
when
the
moonlight
strikes
the
that
dead
tree
comes
back
like
a
great
blue
sphere
of
smoke
half
buoyed
half
ravelling
on
the
grass
rustling
through
frayed
branches
something
eerily
cheeping
through
it
something
creeping
through
its
shade
vision
you
who
flutter
and
quiver
an
instant
just
beyond
my
apprehension
lady
i
will
find
the
white
orchid
for
you
if
you
will
but
give
me
one
smile
between
those
wayward
drifts
of
hair
i
will
break
the
wild
berries
that
loop
themselves
over
the
for
your
sake
and
the
long
green
canes
that
swish
against
each
other
i
will
break
to
set
in
your
hands
for
there
is
no
wonder
like
to
you
you
who
flutter
and
quiver
an
instant
just
beyond
my
apprehension
epilogue
why
it
was
i
do
not
know
but
last
night
i
vividly
dreamed
though
a
thousand
miles
away
that
i
had
come
back
to
you
the
windows
were
the
same
the
bed
the
furniture
the
same
only
there
was
a
door
where
empty
wall
had
always
been
and
someone
was
trying
to
enter
it
i
heard
the
grate
of
a
key
an
unknown
voice
apologetically
excused
its
intrusion
just
as
i
awoke
but
i
wonder
after
all
if
there
was
some
secret
entranceway
some
ghost
i
overlooked
when
i
was
there

symphony
i
the
darkness
rolls
upward
the
thick
darkness
carries
with
it
rain
and
a
ravel
of
cloud
the
sun
comes
forth
upon
earth
palely
the
dawn
leaves
me
facing
timidly
old
gardens
sunken
and
in
the
gardens
is
water
sombre
wreck
autumnal
leaves
shadowy
roofs
in
the
blue
mist
and
a
that
is
broken
oh
old
pagodas
of
my
soul
how
you
glittered
across
green
trees
blue
and
cool
blue
tremulously
blow
faint
puffs
of
smoke
across
sombre
pools
the
damp
green
smell
of
rotted
wood
and
a
heron
that
cries
from
out
the
water
ii
through
the
upland
meadows
i
go
alone
for
i
dreamed
of
someone
last
night
who
is
waiting
for
me
flower
and
blossom
tell
me
do
you
know
of
her
have
the
rocks
hidden
her
voice
they
are
very
blue
and
still
long
upward
road
that
is
leading
me
light
hearted
i
quit
you
for
the
long
loose
ripples
of
the
invite
me
to
dance
upon
them
quivering
grass
daintily
poised
for
her
foot
tripping
oh
blown
clouds
could
i
only
race
up
like
you
oh
the
last
slopes
that
are
and
steep
look
the
sky
across
black
valleys
rise
aloft
jagged
unwrinkled
mountains
ranges
of
death

one

by
the
brook
for
me
one
rages
under
the
stone
one
makes
a
spout
of
his
mouth
one
whispers
one
is
gone
one
over
there
on
the
water
spreads
cold
ripples
for
me
enticingly
the
vast
dark
trees
flow
like
blue
veils
of
tears
into
the
water
sour
sprites
moaning
and
chuckling
what
have
you
hidden
from
me
in
the
palace
of
the
blue
stone
she
lies
forever
bound
hand
and
foot
was
it
the
wind
that
rattled
the
reeds
together
dry
reeds
a
faint
shiver
in
the
grasses

there
is

passengers
in
scarlet
pass
over
the
glittering
tide
under
the
bridge
the
old
river
flows
low
and
monotonous
day
after
day
i
have
heard
and
have
seen
all
the
news
that
has
been
autumn
gold
and
spring
green
now
in
my
palace
i
see
foot
passengers
crossing
the
river
pilgrims
of
autumn
in
the
afternoons
lotus
pools

in
the
water
these
are
my
dreams
for
me

are
outspread

take
my
ease

v
and
now
the
lowest
is
drawn
across
the
disk
of
the
sun
old
friends
who
will
forget
me
soon
i
must
go
on
towards
those
blue
i
have
forgot
so
long
in
the
marsh
grasses
there
lies
forever
my
last
treasure
with
the
hopes
of
my
heart
the
ice
is
glazing
over
tom
lanterns
flutter
on
the
leaves
is
snow
in
the
frosty
evening
toll
the
old
bell
for
me
once
in
the
sleepy
temple
perhaps
my
soul
will
hear
afterglow
before
the
stars
peep
i
shall
creep
out
into
darkness
solitude
in
the
city
in
black
and
i
words
at
midnight
because
the
night
is
so
still
because
there
is
no
one
about
not
the
tiny
squeak
of
a
mouse
over
the
carpet
nor
the
slow
beat
of
a
clock
at
the
top
of
the
stairway
i
am
afraid
of
the
night
that
is
coming
to
me
i
know
out
there
some
one
is
thinking
of
me
some
one
is
wondering
about
me
some
one
is
needing
me
some
one
is
dying
for
my
sake
yet
i
remain
alone
i
know
that
life
is
calling
i
can
not
resist
it
too
much
of
myself
i
have
given
ever
to
turn
away
i
know
that
shame
sickness
death
itself
shall
befall
me
and
i
am
afraid
o
night
hide
me
in
your
long
cold
arms
let
me
sleep
but
let
me
not
live
this
life
there
are
too
many
people
with
haggard
eyes
standing
before
me
saying
to
live
you
must
suffer
even
as
we
yet
life
bitterly
bids
me
go
on
to
the
last
no
matter
the
mud
and
the
cold
rain
and
the
darkness
no
matter
the
drear
pilgrims
in
whose
eyes
you
shall
look
for
long
and
see
all
suffering
madness
death
and
despair
because
my
heart
is
cramped
in
because
i
have
suffered
much
because
my
hope
is
like
a
quenched
at
midnight
because
i
dare
dream
yet
of
joy
i
can
take
my
night
and
the
life
that
is
coming
to
me
ii
the
evening
rain
o
the
rain
of
the
evening
is
an
infinite
thing
as
it
slowly
slips
on
the
motionless
pavement
greasy
and
grey
is
the
rain
of
the
evening
as
it
dribbles
into
the
dirty
gutters
and
slides
down
the
drains
with
a
roar
ragged
men
cower
under
the
doorways
umbrellas
nod
like
drowsy
birds
teetering
balancing
where
will
you
spread
your
wings
tangled
between
the
i
have
seen
the
golden
lamps
wake
this
evening
spinning
and
whirling
darting
and
dancing
tangled
with
the
glittering
rain
omnibuses
lurch
heavily
homeward
elephants
tinselled
in
tawdry
gold
taxicabs
fight
like
wild
birds
squalling
wild
birds
with
roaring
clattering
wings
o
the
rain
of
the
evening
is
an
infinite
thing
as
it
shivers
to
spilt
on
the
pavement
the
façades
frown
gloomily
at
its
beauty
the
façades
are
dreaming
of
the
day
with
rippling
curling
serpentine
convolutions
the
pavements
drip
with
drunken
light
crimson
and
gold
shot
with
opal
they
glare
against
the
sullen
night
o
the
rain
of
the
evening
is
an
infinite
thing
as
it
slowly
dries
on
the
dirty
pavement
red
clouds
jut
over
the
sky
and
in
the
cool
sky
there
are
stars
iii
street
of
sorrows
you
street
of
sorrows
bending
over
your
golden
lamps
in
the
evening
dark
street
that
is
very
silent
and
everywhere
the
same
elsewhere
there
is
song
and
riot
like
golden
fireflies
flickering
elsewhere
the
crane
gaunt
muscles
tug
the
city
up
to
the
stars
but
who
in
the
dawn
should
come
near
you
there
are
dry
leaves
rattling
behind
him
and
who
should
come
in
the
noonday
there
are
shadows
that
squat
on
the
pave
and
who
should
come
in
the
evening
there
is
one
a
ship
in
dark
waters
and
who
should
come
at
nightfall
to
feel
cold
hands
at
his
heart
you
street
of
solitude
waiting
patient
and
still
in
the
evening
old
street
that
is
very
weary
and
everywhere
the
same
you
that
have
seen
joy
passing
into
pain
into
tears
into
darkness
street
of
the
dead
and
musty
i
have
drunk
your
cold
poison
iv
song
in
the
darkness
it
is
the
last
night
that
i
can
be
solitary
henceforth
the
keys
and
wards
of
me
are
held
in
other
hands
dark
clouds
trail
over
the
sky
troops
of
song
retreating
but
in
the
sunset
once
more
have
i
seen
aloft
incredible
summits
of
gold
far
on
the
south
horizon
one
purple
veil
of
rain
floats
downward
over
the
city
and
as
it
settles
slowly
the
light
goes
out
of
it
chimneys
with
massive
summits
stand
gaunt
and
black
and
evil
like
a
river
of
lead
to
seaward
the
river
steadily
rolls
it
is
the
last
night
that
i
can
be
solitary
life
takes
me
in
black
coils
one
green
light
glitters
then
a
swift
taxi
scatters
another
as
it
speeds
on
the
chimneys
rank
their
motionless
forces
against
the
swift
movement
of
tugs
in
the
stream
against
the
of
the
embankment
against
the
bowing
trees
against
the
blowing
smoke
against
the
busy
rain
with
dying
might
the
light
invades
the
city
hall
curtained
by
dripping
fringes
of
buoyant
tattered
cloud
tossed
by
the
wind
it
is
the
last
night
that
i
can
be
solitary
and
all
my
city
of
dreams
is
burning
up
but
yet
there
waits
for
me
something
lost
back
in
the
darkness
something
i
have
never
seized
a
shape
a
voice
a
gesture
something
behind
my
shoulder
grey
robes
that
stir
and
rustle
something
that
moves
away
from
me
when
i
would
touch
it
with
my
hand
cities
of
the
beyond
what
great
horizons
dare
you
climb
up
and
down
what
steep
incredible
valleys
i
suddenly
perceive
that
i
have
been
mocked
in
you
and
therefore
will
i
sow
the
earth
with
rain
of
stars
it
is
the
last
night
that
i
can
be
solitary
the
rain
invites
to
drunkenness
the
wind
blows
through
my
brain
shiplike
the
sliding
golden
trams
procession
by
and
intercross
with
tulips
daffodils
crocuses
the
whole
street
blossoms
at
my
feet
now
kindle
flames
and
let
blow
out
the
crimson
rose
against
the
grey
let
night
itself
be
blotted
out
in
life
monotonous
drone
of
day
it
is
the
last
night
that
i
can
be
solitary
it
is
the
last
time
that
no
feet
but
mine
can
beat
upon
the
floor
it
is
the
last
time
that
no
hands
but
mine
can
pound
upon
my
heart
it
is
the
last
time
that
no
voice
but
mine
can
cry
and
yet
be
lost
it
is
the
last
time
i
shall
see
the
pavements
like
a
mirror
stare
at
me
green
symphony
i
the
glittering
leaves
of
the
rhododendrons
balance
and
vibrate
in
the
cool
air
while
in
the
sky
above
them
white
clouds
chase
each
other
like
scampering
rabbits
flashes
of
sunlight
sweep
the
lawn
they
fling
in
passing
patterns
of
shadow
golden
and
green
with
long
cascades
of
laughter
the
mating
birds
dart
and
swoop
to
the
turf
their
mad
trillings
glints
the
gay
sun
behind
the
trees
down
there
are
deep
blue
lakes
orange
blossom
droops
in
the
water
in
the
tower
of
the
winds
all
the
bells
are
set
adrift
jingling
for
the
dawn
thin
fluttering
streamers
of
breeze
lash
through
the
swaying
boughs
palely
expectant
the
earth
receives
the
slanting
rain
i
am
a
glittering
raindrop
hugged
close
by
the
cool
rhododendron
i
am
a
daisy
starring
the
exquisite
curves
of
the
turf
the
glittering
leaves
of
the
rhododendron
are
shaken
like
blades
of
grass
flickering
cracking
falling
splintering
in
a
million
fragments
the
wind
runs
laughing
up
the
slope
stripping
off
handfuls
of
wet
green
leaves
to
fling
in
peoples
faces
wallowing
on
the
turf
clutching
at
the
sunlight
cavorting
in
the
shadow
like
baroque
pearls
like
cloudy
emeralds
the
clouds
and
the
trees
clash
together
whirling
and
swirling
in
the
tumult
of
the
spring
and
the
wind
ii
the
trees
splash
the
sky
with
their
fingers
a
restless
green
rout
of
stars
with
whirling
movement
they
swing
their
boughs
about
their
stems
planes
on
planes
of
light
and
shadow
pass
among
them
opening
fanlike
to
fall
the
trees
are
like
a
sea
tossing
trembling
roaring
wallowing
darting
their
long
green
flickering
fronds
up
at
the
sky
spotted
with
white
the
trees
are
roofs
hollow
caverns
of
cool
blue
shadow
solemn
arches
in
the
afternoons
the
whole
vast
horizon
in
terrace
beyond
terrace
pinnacle
above
pinnacle
lifts
to
the
sky
serrated
ranks
of
green
on
green
they
caress
the
roofs
with
their
fingers
they
sprawl
about
the
river
to
look
into
it
up
the
hill
they
come
gesticulating
challenge
they
cower
together
in
dark
valleys
they
yearn
out
over
the
fields
enamelled
domes
tumble
upon
the
grass
crashing
in
ruin
quiet
at
last
the
trees
lash
the
sky
with
their
leaves
uneasily
shaking
their
dark
green
manes
iii
far
let
the
voices
of
the
mad
wild
birds
be
calling
me
i
will
abide
in
this
forest
of
pines
when
the
wind
blows
battling
through
the
forest
i
hear
it
distantly
the
crash
of
a
perpetual
sea
when
the
rain
falls
i
watch
silver
spears
slanting
downwards
from
pale
of
sky
enclosed
in
dark
fronds
when
the
sun
shines
i
weave
together
distant
branches
till
they
enclose
mighty
circles
i
sway
to
the
movement
of
hooded
summits
i
swim
leisurely
in
deep
blue
seas
of
air
i
hug
the
smooth
bark
of
stately
red
pillars
and
with
cones
carefully
scattered
i
mark
the
progression
of
dark
flung
diagonally
downwards
through
the
afternoon
this
turf
is
not
like
turf
it
is
a
smooth
dry
carpet
of
velvet
embroidered
with
brown
patterns
of
needles
and
cones
these
trees
are
not
like
trees
they
are
innumerable
feathery
stiffly
ungracious
to
the
wind
teetering
on
stems
in
the
evening
i
listen
to
the
winds
lisping
while
the
conflagrations
of
the
sunset
flicker
and
clash
behind
me
flamboyant
crenellations
of
glory
amid
the
charred
ebony
boles
in
the
night
the
fiery
nightingales
shall
clash
and
trill
through
the
silence
like
the
voices
of
mermaids
crying
from
the
sea
long
ago
has
the
moon
whelmed
this
uncompleted
temple
stars
swim
like
gold
fish
far
above
the
black
arches
far
let
the
timid
feet
of
dawn
fly
to
catch
me
i
will
abide
in
this
forest
of
pines
for
i
have
unveiled
naked
beauty
and
the
things
that
she
whispered
to
me
in
the
darkness
are
buried
deep
in
my
heart
now
let
the
black
tops
of
the
break
like
a
spent
wave
against
the
grey
sky
these
are
tombs
and
memorials
and
temples
and
altars
for
me
golden
symphony
i
seen
from
afar
the
city
is
like
a
golden
cloud
strayed
from
the
sky
and
moulded
into
dim
motionless
towers
music
is
passing
far
off
music
serenely
is
climbing
up
and
vanishing
on
the
long
grey
stairways
of
the
sky
in
fanlike
rays
of
light
now
it
falls
slowly
careering
toppling
shivering
and
quivering
like
burnished
glass
or
golden
cascades
peace
now
let
the
music
sound
from
further
away
red
bells
out
of
blue
dream
of
regret
seen
from
afar
the
city
is
like
a
fleet
of
sails
breaking
the
foam
of
dark
forests
in
which
i
have
strayed
so
long
they
march
together
slowly
the
golden
temple
terraces
against
the
dark
remembrance
of
my
pools
of
despair
o
golden
angelus
that
sounded
prolonging
uncertain
memories
i
have
seen
the
swallows
hovering
to
you
and
followed
their
dark
trails
of
passage
the
gates
of
the
city
lie
open
and
the
whole
world
goes
homeward
bells
in
the
foreground
catching
my
soul
with
them
on
where
the
sun
soars
broadly
through
the
of
the
sky
ii
high
chimes
from
the
belfry
the
noonday
approaches
with
its
golden
apparel
rustling
about
its
feet
high
dreams
of
my
city
where
we
a
band
of
brothers
build
our
proud
dream
of
beauty
before
we
fall
into
dust
the
golden
days
have
come
for
us
with
mandolins
laughter
even
the
very
dust
of
the
street
grows
gold
beneath
our
feet
bronze
poured
from
deep
blue
wells
molten
gold
out
of
the
sky
pillars
of
yellow
marble
on
the
summits
of
which
the
gods
sleep
now
we
are
swimming
about
us
a
great
golden
halo
vibrates
from
us
downwards
ebbing
its
life
away
golden
clouds
are
circling
like
angels
and
archangels
about
the
eye
of
the
sun
flaming
sunset
mad
conflagrations
licking
at
the
earth
the
walls
of
space
iron
mountains
vast
on
the
horizon
o
golden
spear
that
dartled
through
the
darkness
the
evening
star
sparkled
and
threw
us
its
message
iii
in
the
bosom
of
the
desert
i
will
lie
at
the
last
not
the
grey
desert
of
sand
but
the
golden
desert
of
great
wild
grasses
this
shall
receive
my
soul
in
the
high
plateaus
the
wind
will
be
like
a
calling
me
day
after
day
short
bursts
of
surf
the
wind
climbs
up
and
stops
in
the
grass
and
the
golden
petals
brush
drowsily
over
my
face
white
butterfly
that
flutters
across
my
sea
of
golden
blossom
tell
me
what
are
you
looking
for
lone
white
butterfly
i
am
seeking
for
a
strange
lonely
white
flower
its
petals
are
honeyless
and
in
the
wind
it
is
still
white
butterfly
come
fold
your
wings
over
my
heart
i
am
the
white
blossom
the
white
dead
blossom
for
you
in
the
golden
bosom
of
the
prairie
i
am
lying
at
the
last
like
a
pool
that
is
stilled
but
they
who
shared
with
me
my
life
adventure
who
tossed
their
ducats
like
dandelions
into
the
sunlight
i
know
that
somewhere
they
with
songs
are
building
golden
towers
more
beautiful
than
my
own
iv
i
only
know
in
the
midnight
something
will
be
born
of
me
the
village
drowses
in
the
darkness
but
aloft
in
the
temple
there
is
a
thud
of
gongs
and
a
shuffle
of
hollow
voices
in
the
dark
corridors
the
golden
temple
that
kindled
like
a
rose
against
the
sunset
now
is
dark
and
silent
one
light
glimmers
from
its
façade
in
the
inner
shrine
one
stiff
golden
curtain
hangs
from
floor
to
roof
black
impassive
helmeted
in
felt
like
stiff
black
warriors
the
lamas
slowly
gather
kneeling
in
a
row
the
hollow
brazen
trumpets
blare
and
snore
the
drums
festooned
with
skulls
roar
suddenly
with
a
clash
of
gongs
and
a
squeal
from
bugles
the
golden
veil
is
rent
cavernous
blue
darkness
and
within
it
smiling
naked
rippling
with
light
behold
the
god
hail
great
jewel
in
the
lotus
blossom
rosy
flame
that
kindling
flashes
on
the
emptiness
or
nirvana
sea
before
the
shrine
as
before
once
more
the
golden
curtain
and
the
black
shapes
vanish
aloft
in
the
hollow
temple
there
is
a
shuffle
of
feet
and
a
sound
of
hollow
voices
soon
lost
the
village
drowses
in
the
darkness
like
a
vast
black
cube
the
temple
looms
above
it
there
is
no
light
on
its
façade
suddenly
all
the
golden
temple
kindles
like
a
rose
against
the
dawn
i
only
know
in
the
midnight
something
has
been
born
of
me
white
symphony
i
forlorn
and
white
whorls
of
purity
about
a
golden
chalice
immense
the
peonies
flare
and
shatter
their
petals
over
my
face
they
slowly
turn
paler
they
seem
to
be
melting
like
flakes
of
ice
thin
greyish
shivers
fluctuating
mid
the
dark
green
of
the
leaves
like
snowballs
tossed
like
soft
white
butterflies
the
peonies
poise
in
the
twilight
and
their
narcotic
insinuating
perfume
draws
me
into
them
shivering
with
the
coolness
aching
with
the
void
they
kiss
the
blue
chalice
of
my
dreams
like
a
gesture
seen
for
an
instant
and
then
lost
forever
outwards
the
petals
thrust
to
embrace
me
pale
daggers
of
coldness
run
through
my
aching
breast
outwards
still
outwards
till
on
the
brink
of
twilight
they
swirl
downwards
silently
flurry
of
snow
in
the
void
outwards
still
outwards
till
the
blue
walls
are
hidden
and
in
the
blinding
white
radiance
of
a
whirlpool
of
clouds
i
awake
like
spraying
rockets
my
peonies
shower
their
glories
on
the
night
wavering
perfumes
drift
about
the
garden
shadows
of
the
moonlight
drift
and
ripple
over
the
leaves
soar
crash
and
sparkle
shoal
of
stars
drifting
like
silver
fishes
through
the
black
sluggish
boughs
towards
the
impossible
towards
the
inaccessible
towards
the
ultimate
towards
the
silence
towards
the
eternal
these
blossoms
go
the
peonies
spring
like
rockets
in
the
twilight
and
out
of
them
all
i
rise
ii
downwards
through
the
blue
abyss
it
slides
the
white
of
my
dreams
downwards
crashing
from
slippery
rock
into
the
boiling
chasm
in
which
no
eye
dare
look
for
it
is
the
chasm
of
death
upwards
from
the
blue
abyss
it
rises
the
chill
of
my
dreams
upwards
to
greyish
weeping
pines
and
to
skies
of
autumn
ever
about
my
heart
it
is
blue
at
the
beginning
and
against
the
it
wavers
in
the
upper
air
catching
unconscious
sparkles
a
of
sunlight
and
fading
in
the
sad
depths
of
the
sky
outwards
rush
the
strong
pale
clouds
outwards
and
ever
outwards
the
clouds
indistinguishable
one
from
another
nervous
sinewy
tossing
their
arms
and
brandishing
till
on
the
blue
serrations
of
the
horizon
they
drench
with
their
black
rain
a
great
peak
of
changeless
snow
as
evening
came
on
i
climbed
the
tower
to
gaze
upon
the
city
far
beneath
i
was
not
weary
of
day
but
in
the
evening
a
white
mist
assembled
and
gathered
over
the
earth
and
blotted
it
from
sight
but
to
escape
to
chase
with
the
golden
clouds
galloping
over
the
horizon
arrows
of
the
northwest
wind
singing
amid
them
ruffling
up
my
hair
as
evening
came
on
the
distance
altered
pale
wavering
reflections
rose
from
out
the
city
like
sighs
or
the
beckoning
of
hands
monotonously
and
sluggishly
they
crept
upwards
a
river
that
had
spent
itself
in
some
chasm
and
dwindled
and
foamed
at
last
at
my
weary
feet
autumn
golden
fountains
and
the
winds
neighing
amid
the
monotonous
hills
desolation
of
the
old
gods
rain
that
lifts
and
rain
that
moves
away
in
the
greenback
torrent
scarlet
leaves
it
was
now
perfectly
evening
and
the
tower
loomed
like
a
gaunt
peak
in
above
the
city
its
base
was
utterly
lost
it
was
slowly
coming
on
to
rain
and
the
immense
columns
of
white
mist
wavered
and
broke
before
the
spears
i
will
descend
the
mountains
like
a
shepherd
and
in
the
folds
of
tumultuous
misty
cities
i
will
put
all
my
thoughts
all
my
old
thoughts
safely
to
sleep
for
it
is
already
autumn
o
whiteness
of
the
pale
southwestern
sky
o
wavering
dream
that
was
not
mine
to
keep
in
midnight
in
mournful
moonlight
by
paths
i
could
not
trace
i
walked
in
the
white
garden
each
flower
had
a
white
face
their
perfume
intoxicated
me
thus
i
began
my
dream
i
was
alone
i
had
no
one
to
guide
me
but
the
moon
was
like
the
sun
it
stooped
and
kissed
each
waxen
petal
one
after
one
green
and
white
was
that
garden
diamond
rain
hung
in
the
branches
you
will
not
believe
it
in
the
morning
at
the
dayspring
i
wakened
shivering
lo
the
white
garden
that
blossomed
at
my
feet
was
a
garden
hidden
in
snow
it
was
my
sorrow
to
see
that
all
this
was
a
dream
iii
blue
clogged
with
purple
mists
uncoil
themselves
sparkling
to
the
horizon
i
see
the
snow
alone
in
the
deep
blue
chasm
boats
sleep
under
gold
thatch
trees
fret
faintly
sky
under
their
heaped
leaden
houses
shiver
through
thin
blue
crevasses
trickles
an
icy
stream
the
pines
groan
the
waves
shiver
struck
by
the
wind
beyond
from
treeless
horizons
broken
crawl
to
the
sea
wearily
the
snow
glares
through
the
grey
silence
day
after
day
mocking
the
colourless
cloudless
sky
with
the
reflection
of
death
there
is
no
smoke
through
the
pine
tops
no
strong
red
boatmen
in
pale
green
reeds
no
herons
to
flicker
an
instant
no
lanterns
to
glow
with
gay
ray
no
sails
beat
up
to
the
harbour
with
creaking
cordage
and
sailors
song
somnolent
indifferent
they
sleep
and
the
city
sleeps
about
them
casts
its
dreary
fortifications
each
day
is
a
gaunt
grey
rock
and
death
is
the
last
of
them
all
over
the
sluggish
snow
drifts
now
a
pallid
weak
shower
of
bloom
boredom
of
fresh
creation
of
old
returns
white
white
blossom
fall
of
the
shattered
cups
day
on
day
is
there
anything
here
that
is
not
ancient
that
has
not
bloomed
a
thousand
years
ago
under
the
glare
of
the
day
under
the
restless
of
the
winter
white
blossom
or
white
snow
scattered
and
beneath
them
dark
the
graves
dark
graves
never
changing
white
dream
drifting
never
changing
above
them
o
that
the
white
scroll
of
heaven
might
be
rolled
up
and
the
naked
red
lightning
thrust
at
the
smouldering
earth
midsummer
dreams
symphony
in
white
and
blue
i
there
is
a
tall
white
weed
growing
at
the
top
of
this
sand
hill
in
the
grass
it
is
very
still
it
lifts
its
heavy
bracts
of
flattened
bloom
against
the
sky
hazily
grey
with
brume
out
over
yonder
boats
pass
and
the
swallows
flatten
themselves
on
the
grass
the
lake
is
silvering
beneath
the
heat
the
wind
feet
touch
lazily
each
crest
like
white
gulls
slow
flapping
to
windward
one
rose
white
cloud
slowly
disengages
loosening
itself
and
stands
above
the
water
like
dione
daughter
braiding
up
her
wet
hair
with
her
pale
hands
ii
the
moon
puts
out
her
face
at
a
rift
between
the
trees
which
do
not
lift
one
drooping
leaf
this
night
of
june
there
is
no
lazy
breeze
to
set
them
clashing
adrift
thin
gleams
of
silver
rise
and
break
in
the
air
fireflies
here
and
there
forest
of
blue
masses
suddenly
quivering
with
rapid
points
of
white
are
the
forests
beneath
the
sea
where
no
breeze
passes
as
still
as
you
the
moon
puts
out
her
face
at
a
rift
between
the
trees
through
my
window
the
bed
cut
evenly
with
diagonal
shafts
of
light
is
a
boat
rocking
out
adrift
under
it
bend
the
silver
tips
of
the
dark
blue
coral
trees
and
fireflies
like
glass
fish
drift
and
ripple
upwards
in
the
breeze
iii
we
are
drifting
slowly
you
and
i
to
where
the
clouds
are
lifting
towers
in
the
sky
palaces
of
ivory
which
we
look
at
dreamily
over
our
sail
frail
white
clouds
drift
as
slowly
over
the
undulant
pale
blue
silk
of
the
water
as
we
we
are
racing
swiftly
you
and
i
the
sun
darts
one
firm
track
through
the
of
the
crinkled
water
gold
spirals
spattering
flashing
the
water
heaves
and
curls
away
at
our
bow
a
mad
fish
splashing
we
are
rocked
together
you
and
i
to
this
undulant
movement
white
cloud
with
blue
water
blent
cloud
dipping
down
to
wave
its
lazy
head
wave
curling
under
cloud
its
cloudy
blue
i
and
you
all
alone
alone
at
last
i
hold
you
fast
iv
the
midsummer
clouds
were
piling
up
upon
the
south
horizon
mountains
of
drifting
translucence
in
the
of
the
sky
ascending
and
toppling
in
crumbled
ravines
dribbling
down
chasms
of
silence
reassembling
in
crowded
multitudes
massive
forms
one
above
another
and
i
saw
in
their
ridges
and
hollows
the
appearance
of
a
woman
immeasurable
carven
in
stainless
marble
motionless
naked
fair
her
head
thrown
back
her
pointed
breasts
in
chill
sunlight
her
heavy
flanks
dark
in
the
shadow
resting
forever
inert
and
up
to
her
there
suddenly
clomb
and
hurried
another
cloud
huge
hairy
bulging
and
knobby
with
dark
and
knotted
brows
and
he
thrust
out
long
bungling
arms
to
her
and
drew
himself
up
to
her
and
i
watched
them
melting
together
blue
mouth
to
sad
white
mouth
orange
symphony
i
now
that
all
the
world
is
filled
with
armies
clamouring
now
that
men
no
longer
live
and
die
one
by
one
but
in
vague
indeterminate
multitudes
now
that
the
trees
are
coppery
towers
now
that
the
clouds
loom
southward
now
that
the
glossy
creeper
spatters
the
walls
like
spilt
wine
i
will
go
out
alone
to
catch
strong
joy
of
solitude
where
the
treelines
in
gold
and
scarlet
swing
strong
up
the
smouldering
face
of
the
hill
ii
guns
crashing
thudding
ululating
tumultuous
guns
yelping
over
the
cracked
earth
where
dry
bugles
blare
here
in
this
hollow
it
is
very
quiet
only
the
wind
hissing
laughter
in
the
place
of
tombs
one
by
one
these
gaunt
scarred
faces
lift
up
blurred
wrinkled
inscriptions
silently
beseeching
me
to
stop
and
ponder
what
does
it
matter
if
i
do
not
stop
to
read
them
no
one
at
all
has
gone
this
way
that
i
have
chosen
before
a
leaf
drops
slowly
in
silence
it
is
a
long
time
twisting
and
hovering
on
its
way
to
the
earth
guns
booming
bellowing
crashing
desperate
insistent
outcry
of
savage
guns
rocking
the
gloomy
hollow
i
will
run
out
like
the
wind
snarling
with
savage
laughter
like
the
wind
that
tosses
the
clouds
against
the
barrier
of
flaming
trees
i
will
race
between
the
grey
guns
and
the
clouds
like
shrapnel
exploding
flinging
their
hail
through
the
tumult
bursting
will
melt
in
cold
spray
i
am
the
wanderer
of
the
world
no
one
can
hold
me
not
the
cannon
assembled
for
battle
nor
the
gloomy
graves
of
the
hollow
nor
the
house
where
i
long
time
slumbered
nor
the
hilltop
where
roads
are
straggling
my
feet
must
march
to
the
wind
like
a
leaf
dropping
slowly
an
orange
butterfly
turning
and
twisting
i
touch
with
moist
passionate
palms
the
leaden
inscriptions
of
my
past
then
i
turn
to
depart
iii
the
trees
dance
about
the
inn
the
wind
thrusts
them
into
flamelets
now
my
thoughts
gipsying
go
forth
to
strange
walls
and
new
fires
mouths
stained
with
berries
bronzed
cheeks
sunken
unshaven
ragged
attire
we
swing
our
guitars
at
the
hip
as
we
tramp
heedless
uncaring
in
the
inn
the
fire
crackles
on
the
hearth
the
wine
is
simmering
lift
up
the
brown
beaker
one
instant
drink
deeply
fling
out
the
last
coin
let
us
go
on
the
plains
there
is
drooping
harvest
but
no
harvest
can
for
long
time
hold
us
we
have
seen
the
winds
baffled
racing
up
the
trench
of
the
hills
iv
on
the
hill
summit
where
the
gusty
wind
all
night
long
has
assailed
me
now
i
see
stars
vanishing
before
the
long
cold
clutching
fingers
of
dawn
stars
scintillant
metallic
topaz
fruit
of
the
garden
southward
you
go
my
constellations
and
leave
me
with
the
white
day
alone
over
the
hilltop
swish
with
a
scurry
of
wings
millions
of
pale
brown
birds
songless
pulsing
southward
birds
who
have
filled
the
trees
and
who
fled
long
ago
at
my
passing
now
you
clatter
in
heedless
tumult
fanning
with
your
hot
wings
my
face
carry
this
word
to
the
southward
say
that
i
have
forgotten
them
that
wait
for
me
all
the
loves
and
the
hates
need
expect
me
no
longer
in
the
autumn
at
last
i
am
alone
suddenly
the
wind
crashes
through
the
stripping
away
their
domes
stark
blue
skeletons
forbidding
gesticulate
in
my
face
you
whom
i
planted
and
lavished
with
all
the
wealth
and
beauty
i
had
to
bestow
hurry
away
vain
harvest
the
winds
scythes
can
reap
you
where
you
lie
on
the
earth
and
to
death
barns
you
can
go
beyond
the
hilltop
i
have
seen
only
the
sky
the
wind
naked
prodding
up
clouds
cossacks
of
winter
cry
wind
shriek
to
the
shivering
southland
that
i
am
going
into
winter
that
i
do
not
hope
to
return
farewell
crowded
stars
farewell
birds
winds
clouds
and
i
weary
of
you
all
seek
my
destined
joy
in
the
amid
blue
ice
and
the
night
of
the
pole
v
beyond
the
land
there
lies
the
sea
and
on
the
sea
with
wings
unfurled
bloodily
huge
the
sunset
rests
feathers
flickering
and
claws
curled
watching
to
seize
the
ruined
world
rolling
in
a
torrent
brown
leaves
my
achievements
rise
up
from
valleys
and
scatter
themselves
on
the
sea
brown
birds
my
wild
dreams
mingle
their
bodies
together
shrieking
and
clamouring
as
they
pass
black
charred
silhouettes
against
the
west
curtained
in
orange
flame
now
the
wind
starts
up
and
strikes
the
seething
water
hissing
in
uncoiled
fury
each
wave
darts
forward
to
clash
and
batter
the
smouldering
cliff
where
the
end
of
my
road
is
lost
rise
up
black
clouds
pounce
upon
the
sunset
tear
it
with
your
jagged
teeth
fling
yourselves
seething
winds
in
circles
upon
the
water
swirl
leaves
and
dance
amid
the
chaos
of
breakers
flicker
birds
an
instant
against
the
tawny
tiger
throat
of
the
sun
which
is
snarling
in
the
west
beat
down
o
great
winds
westward
loose
reins
and
gallop
to
seaward
rush
me
too
to
that
ocean
in
which
i
have
found
my
goal
lash
me
lap
me
rugged
waves
of
water
dash
me
clutch
me
and
do
not
let
me
rest
one
instant
all
through
the
night
rock
and
soothe
me
till
i
awaken
dreamingly
at
the
faint
rose
breast
of
the
dawn
red
symphony
i
over
the
cauldron
of
the
sea
heavily
on
wings
of
leaden
cloud
howling
the
sunset
races
out
to
assail
me
long
have
i
voyaged
night
after
night
the
grey
rains
swept
the
sea
the
heaving
breakers
hissed
and
quivered
but
held
no
light
now
my
voyage
is
ending
white
storm
winds
have
swept
bare
my
soul
with
their
harsh
laughter
their
maddening
mockery
their
of
despair
over
the
keen
zenith
roll
crushingly
huge
masses
of
cloud
dull
ponderous
sagging
with
the
burden
of
creaking
snow
they
drop
flat
on
the
sea
they
hang
menacing
over
me
they
festoon
the
sun
with
swags
of
crimson
light
they
stripe
the
horizon
they
bar
every
way
with
their
iron
tongues
they
loom
weltering
over
my
effort
they
steadfastly
close
me
in
meanwhile
the
sun
with
dying
force
wrenches
one
little
crack
in
the
midst
of
the
sagging
masses
and
i
steer
on
to
it
like
a
crimson
lake
the
light
overflows
and
touches
the
bulging
surfaces
with
carmine
with
scarlet
with
orange
with
vermillion
with
brick
red
with
bluish
purple
with
maroon
with
rose
with
russet
with
savage
green
with
snowy
blue
with
grey
with
ebony
with
gold
it
is
the
storm
of
the
evening
that
races
out
shrieking
to
assail
me
and
i
hail
it
ii
the
sky
vast
emptiness
is
crowded
with
fragments
colliding
ragged
splintered
masses
swirling
away
to
the
night
the
volcano
of
the
sun
has
burst
and
split
its
crater
black
slag
is
hurled
to
the
zenith
above
the
red
black
shrivelled
charred
fragments
fall
into
the
scarlet
torrent
huge
tresses
of
darkness
sweep
over
my
face
leaving
me
choking
the
sea
is
one
crimson
steaming
fire
each
fanged
wavelet
flickers
and
dances
about
the
one
behind
it
hungrily
licking
at
the
ship
fierce
whirling
swords
tossed
lancelike
spit
and
stab
then
suddenly
fall
leaving
me
there
on
a
rolling
summit
of
flame
facing
a
gulf
of
despair
the
ship
lurches
with
prow
into
the
and
rises
rapidly
dripping
liquid
lire
long
twisted
necklaces
that
burn
out
to
green
frozen
chrysolite
iii
over
my
head
a
bell
beats
it
is
midnight
perhaps
i
will
live
to
the
dawn
about
me
are
the
mouths
of
yawning
furnaces
and
from
these
scarlet
mouths
the
heat
outpours
and
darts
and
licks
its
dry
tongues
at
my
brain
till
it
too
seems
a
black
shell
almost
bursting
with
the
force
of
flame
in
it
still
wearily
i
swing
my
shovel
spattering
the
black
coal
over
the
palates
of
the
snoring
mouths
which
rapidly
swallow
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
my
legs
seem
melting
away
in
sweat
beneath
me
in
my
body
my
lungs
and
heart
are
fighting
for
air
my
eyes
are
seared
by
the
appalling
scarlet
of
the
furnaces
about
me
i
them
my
shovelfuls
fall
short
with
every
swing
without
i
hear
the
battering
of
the
tempest
the
ship
is
pounded
sideways
by
black
immeasurable
and
rising
dizzily
again
like
a
fighter
is
again
sent
downwards
by
those
unseen
fists
my
shovel
rises
to
the
ship
slow
recovery
my
shovel
shoots
out
at
the
smash
of
toppling
masses
sometimes
i
pause
and
pant
for
an
endless
instant
while
the
ship
crouches
quivering
over
my
head
a
bell
beats
it
is
morning
wearily
i
drop
the
shovel
and
drag
myself
to
the
deck
iv
afar
there
is
something
that
seems
a
shore
the
sky
has
been
blown
clean
of
clouds
except
to
westward
and
these
stare
hard
at
me
like
huge
sardonyx
towers
i
cling
to
a
rail
that
reels
and
dances
soused
by
the
choking
water
my
face
a
streaming
mass
of
blood
and
salt
and
grime
i
wait
and
dizzily
i
try
to
remember
what
is
this
city
that
out
there
awaits
me
am
i
its
conqueror
will
scarlet
flags
hang
fluttering
in
the
streets
to
greet
my
coming
will
crimson
lanterns
jingle
and
toss
in
festival
has
the
fire
burned
the
ship
and
is
the
water
but
stinging
icy
fire
that
whips
and
sears
my
face
down
there
the
furnaces
go
out
for
the
water
sloshes
about
the
floor
and
steaming
acrid
fumes
arise
no
living
soul
could
stay
in
such
a
place
out
here
the
decks
are
shattered
the
boats
are
shorn
away
and
far
on
the
horizon
the
city
glares
with
its
sardonyx
towers
now
the
red
bells
the
bells
the
storm
bells
break
loose
from
the
horizon
leaping
upon
the
eastern
sea
and
breaking
it
in
their
teeth
the
towers
infuriate
enkindle
from
base
to
summit
in
layers
and
orange
terraces
against
the
blue
snow
haze
that
drifts
down
on
them
from
the
east
the
ship
of
my
soul
is
rolling
to
port
at
last
with
one
clang
from
its
heaving
boilers
one
sigh
from
its
shaking
funnels
one
rattle
from
its
loosened
chains
i
will
lash
myself
to
the
masthead
and
wait
and
till
the
city
that
is
all
one
scarlet
flame
of
death
takes
me
to
itself
at
last
violet
symphony
i
but
yesterday
moonsails
were
raking
high
the
harbour
of
my
dreams
dull
night
of
trees
dark
sorrows
drooping
glittering
raindrops
gleam
on
you
in
recollection
of
my
despair
but
yesterday
stardust
was
scattered
deep
on
the
dark
gulf
of
my
dreams
wind
of
the
night
questing
swaying
calling
rustle
of
dull
grasses
why
do
you
trouble
me
yesterday
purple
mist
was
powdered
on
the
windless
sea
of
dreams
faces
of
the
night
that
pass
me
haggard
monotonous
faces
windblown
hair
and
lustful
lips
i
am
not
what
you
desire
yesterday
one
two
sails
above
the
mist
windswallows
that
hover
towards
the
rainclouds
of
the
horizon
out
of
the
reedy
harbours
rocking
swaying
falling
blown
to
sea
and
parted
yesterday
yesterday
ii
bloom
of
night
globed
grapes
clustered
morosely
down
the
dark
vineyards
of
untrodden
streets
the
noise
of
the
moments
is
like
the
clash
of
the
hoofs
of
a
horse
rattling
thin
tattoo
in
the
stillness
the
noise
of
the
moments
takes
me
uncaring
towards
the
day
with
brassy
crash
dawn
corybants
invade
and
trample
the
vineyard
like
a
faun
i
hide
and
watch
them
a
dark
cup
in
my
hand
spoilers
of
my
vineyard
spilling
the
lees
of
my
sweet
red
wine
you
will
yet
ask
in
vain
for
a
cup
that
is
not
yours
a
purple
dewy
cup
of
lonely
night
tramplers
in
the
morning
sunburnt
faces
and
weary
lips
there
is
yet
a
cup
here
you
can
not
have
i
hold
it
in
my
hands
would
you
drink
of
it
lay
down
your
thyrse
and
timbrel
break
the
harsh
dance
that
flickers
through
the
morning
forget
the
scarlet
perfumes
of
the
day
remember
only
starless
night
cool
swish
of
many
seas
faint
of
evening
cool
marble
in
the
silence
grapes
of
night
crushed
freshly
deep
sleep
and
the
drowsy
stars
iii
i
love
the
night
that
in
long
violet
shroud
slowly
and
lovingly
wraps
up
the
day
hiding
its
blurred
imperfections
in
endless
tenderness
i
love
the
high
violet
cone
of
light
with
thin
haze
on
the
horizon
like
a
wavering
summer
sea
but
most
of
all
i
love
midsummer
dawn
when
planes
of
light
ascend
and
tremble
together
like
distant
purple
waves
the
sound
of
whose
dim
breaking
is
lost
in
the
wild
babel
of
awaking
birds
iv
twisted
fragments
of
violet
paper
the
dawn
drops
you
into
the
green
bowl
filled
with
the
day
grey
waves
i
love
the
deep
purple
grapes
that
yesterday
were
crushed
and
spilled
in
long
and
sluggish
rivers
that
joined
and
made
a
sea
where
through
the
mist
two
golden
sails
drifted
on
silently
the
blue
fume
of
my
dreams
is
laced
with
violet
flame
one
golden
sail
alone
came
back
to
rest
in
its
nest
among
the
reeds
the
other
sail
is
lost
behind
the
mist
beyond
the
craggy
rock
about
which
race
in
jagged
white
the
waves
horizon
on
horizon
far
away
she
waits
but
through
the
day
comes
no
faint
song
nor
creaking
of
the
ropes
twisted
fragments
of
violet
paper
charred
and
fallen
out
of
the
green
bowl
lazily
coils
grey
smoke
grey
symphony
i
up
on
the
hillside
a
long
row
of
larches
shake
from
their
grizzled
beards
the
vestiges
of
rain
from
melting
their
arches
the
spring
goes
up
again
writhing
exuding
streaming
the
earth
is
breathing
to
the
sky
wet
clouds
of
spring
dim
rosy
fans
the
trees
as
they
flick
to
and
fro
seem
driving
greyish
vapour
over
the
snow
the
sky
remodulates
itself
from
to
blue
under
the
upturned
eaves
of
the
blue
larches
the
sun
looks
through
now
with
the
heat
of
the
sun
the
quiver
they
slide
in
muddy
trickles
towards
the
river
up
on
the
hillside
between
the
long
row
of
larches
fume
up
from
south
pale
clouds
that
bear
the
rain
in
pearl
and
violet
arches
they
break
and
shape
again
ii
i
have
seen
in
the
evening
the
clouds
roll
wearily
back
from
northward
to
the
place
whence
first
they
came
one
or
two
orange
lamps
burnt
low
against
deep
purple
hills
the
wind
was
hurrying
bundling
them
together
the
pines
awoke
to
sing
the
song
of
the
snow
buzzing
and
screaming
on
its
one
string
i
have
seen
within
my
heart
crocuses
purple
and
gold
drop
cold
and
dull
and
colourless
beneath
the
snow
one
or
two
orange
lamps
burnt
low
vain
memories
the
wind
has
driven
me
too
many
winters
my
songs
are
snowflakes
whirling
about
my
breast
i
will
wrap
my
frozen
and
bitter
songs
about
me
in
one
grey
drift
and
rest
iii
fluttering
and
soft
the
snow
flings
outward
swirls
and
settles
but
when
i
try
to
seize
it
the
wind
tears
it
away
through
poised
green
platforms
of
enormous
pines
i
see
far
hilltops
pushing
up
blue
roofs
snow
comes
and
hums
through
the
woof
of
the
lower
branches
it
skips
and
dances
it
drops
in
sluggish
folds
of
grey
to
where
the
frozen
rhododendron
bushes
with
lower
play
and
the
earth
hushes
its
movement
fluttering
and
soft
the
snow
is
blent
in
long
loose
spirals
with
my
dream
it
is
all
i
have
the
snow
and
i
know
that
when
i
chase
it
it
will
fly
from
me
beyond
the
lifeless
green
beyond
the
low
blue
hills
beyond
the
pale
glare
down
in
the
west
it
goes
straight
southward
where
the
flare
of
sunset
flows
and
into
the
blackened
heart
of
my
last
rose
pours
its
despair
fluttering
soft
and
dim
regrets
that
skip
and
skim
grey
in
the
grey
twilight
slim
and
weary
whirls
the
snow
and
where
it
goes
i
too
shall
go
iv
of
my
long
nights
afar
in
alien
cities
i
have
remembered
only
this
they
were
black
scarves
all
dusted
over
with
silver
in
which
i
wrapped
my
dreams
they
were
black
screens
on
which
i
made
those
pictures
that
faded
out
next
day
youth
without
glory
manhood
one
mad
struggle
maturity
a
battle
without
trumpet
calls
long
gleams
from
pallid
suns
seen
only
in
my
dreaming
struck
those
dissolving
walls
and
of
my
days
i
only
know
they
slipped
and
fell
like
sunsets
into
the
that
held
the
snow
three
lofty
pines
at
the
corners
of
my
heart
waited
apart
they
only
see
in
the
mystery
of
the
grey
sky
the
jaggled
clouds
that
fly
endlessly
poppies
of
the
red
year
a
symphony
in
scarlet
i
the
words
that
i
have
written
to
me
become
as
poppies
deep
angry
disks
of
scarlet
flame
in
the
stillness
of
a
shut
room
silken
their
edges
undulate
out
to
me
drooping
on
their
hairy
stems
flaring
like
folded
shawls
like
rockets
starting
to
break
and
shatter
their
light
and
heavy
blossom
darting
faint
shivers
through
me
globed
chinese
lanterns
on
green
silk
cords
over
motionless
pools
these
are
lamps
of
a
festival
of
sleep
held
each
night
to
welcome
me
through
dark
doors
out
to
the
dull
blue
heavy
fumes
of
opium
rolling
from
their
rent
red
hearts
i
go
to
seek
my
dream
ii
a
riven
wall
like
a
face
half
torn
away
stares
blankly
at
the
evening
and
from
a
window
like
a
crooked
mouth
it
barks
at
the
sunset
sky
and
over
there
beyond
on
plains
where
night
has
settled
encampments
of
vaporous
blue
smoke
or
mist
three
men
are
riding
one
of
them
looks
and
sees
the
sky
one
of
them
looks
and
sees
the
earth
the
last
one
looks
and
sees
nothing
at
all
they
ride
on
one
of
them
pauses
and
says
it
is
death
another
pauses
and
says
it
is
life
the
last
one
pauses
and
says
is
a
dream
his
bridle
shakes
the
sky
is
filled
with
oval
clouds
through
which
the
sun
long
settled
strikes
at
random
enkindling
here
and
there
blotched
circles
of
rosy
light
these
are
poppies
unclosing
immense
corollas
waving
the
horsemen
on
over
the
earth
upheaving
folding
they
ride
their
bridles
shake
one
of
them
sees
the
sky
is
red
one
of
them
sees
the
earth
is
dark
the
last
man
sees
he
rides
to
his
death
yet
he
says
nothing
at
all
iii
there
will
be
no
harvest
at
all
this
year
for
the
gaunt
black
slopes
arising
lift
the
wrinkled
aching
furrows
of
their
fields
falling
away
to
the
rainy
sky
in
vain
but
in
the
furrows
there
is
grass
and
many
flowers
scarlet
tossing
poppies
flutter
their
edges
on
which
gorged
black
flies
poise
and
sway
in
drunken
sleep
the
black
flies
hang
above
the
tangled
trampled
grasses
grey
crumpled
bundles
lie
in
them
they
sprawl
heave
faintly
and
between
their
stiffened
fingers
run
out
clogged
crimson
trickles
spattering
the
poppies
and
standing
in
beads
on
the
grass
iv
i
saw
last
night
sudden
puffs
of
flame
in
the
northern
sky
the
sky
was
an
even
expanse
of
rolling
grey
smoke
lit
faintly
by
the
moon
that
hung
its
white
face
in
a
dead
tree
to
the
east
within
the
depths
of
greenish
greyish
smoke
were
roars
crackles
and
spheres
of
vapour
and
then
huge
disks
of
crimson
shooting
up
falling
away
and
i
said
these
are
flower
petals
sleep
petals
dream
petals
blown
by
the
winds
of
a
dream
but
still
the
crimson
rockets
rose
they
seemed
to
be
one
great
field
of
immense
poppies
burning
evenly
casting
their
viscid
perfume
to
the
earth
the
earth
is
sown
with
dead
and
out
of
these
the
red
blooms
are
pushing
up
advancing
higher
and
each
night
brings
them
nigher
closer
closer
to
my
heart
v
by
the
sluggish
canal
that
winds
between
thin
ugly
dunes
there
are
no
passing
boats
with
creaking
ropes
but
when
the
evening
crouches
down
like
a
hurt
rabbit
under
the
everlasting
raincloud
whirling
up
the
north
horizon
downwards
on
the
stream
will
float
glowing
points
of
fire
orange
coppery
scarlet
crimson
rosy
flickering
they
pass
the
lanterns
of
the
unknown
dead
out
where
the
sea
sailless
is
mouthing
and
fretting
its
chaos
of
pebbles
and
dried
sticks
by
the
dunes
by
the
wall
of
that
house
that
looks
like
a
face
half
torn
away
and
from
its
flat
mouth
barks
at
the
sky
the
sky
which
is
shot
with
broad
red
disks
of
light
petals
drowsily
falling
vi
it
was
not
for
a
sacred
cause
nor
for
faith
nor
for
new
generations
that
unburied
we
roll
and
float
beneath
this
flaming
tumult
of
drunken
but
it
was
for
a
mad
adventure
something
we
longed
for
poisonous
seductive
that
we
dared
go
out
in
the
night
together
towards
the
glow
that
called
us
on
the
unsown
fields
of
death
now
we
lie
here
reaped
ungarnered
red
swaths
of
a
new
harvest
but
you
who
follow
after
must
struggle
with
our
dream
and
out
of
its
restless
and
oppressive
night
filled
with
blue
fumes
dull
choking
you
will
draw
hints
of
that
vision
which
we
hold
aloof
in
silence
the
end
