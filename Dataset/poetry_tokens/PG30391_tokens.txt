this

respectfully
inscribed
preface
to
the
readers
of
this
poem
an
apology
is
needed
for
affixing
thereto
a
praem
some
friends
of
mine
have
been
plaguing
me
beyond
the
restrictive
line
of
patience
for
the
true
cause
of
conceiving
the
accompanying
collection
of
words
balderdash
or
what
you
will
some
even
asseverating
with
the
eruditeness
of
an
aristole
that
it
was
a
nebulous
idea
an
embryonic
form
of
thought
hibernating
within
the
cavities
of
my
inner
apex
the
remnants
of
that
wild
phantasmagoric
dream
of
vicious
vulpine
labyrinths
of
hell
partly
expounded
in
my
the
flight
of
a
soul
now
to
satisfy
everybody
but
my
friends
i
throw
my
prejudices
to
the
winds
and
confess
to
wit
that
i
with
the
buckler
of
will
wooed
oblivion
on
september
the
sixth
at
exactly
having
been
up
at
my
desk
mauling
and
drubbing
the
english
language
with
a
vengeance
for
consecutive
hours
and
that
i
awoke
at
that
selfsame
night
with
the
entire
contents
of
the
accompanying
have
as
yet
not
decided
in
what
category
the
critics
will
consign
this
weird
hypotyposis
of
the
supernal
jingling
through
my
tired
brain
i
set
to
work
at
exactly
and
wrote
until
our
esteemed
companions
of
the
nocturnal
hours
ceased
their
unloved
music
mosquitos
hied
myself
back
to
bed
and
hypothecated
as
many
winks
as
dame
slumber
saw
fit
to
allot
to
me
who
am
at
continued
war
with
her
silent
wand
the
same
tactics
were
employed
during
the
succeeding
fifteen
nights
wherein
i
penned
eight
thousand
one
hundred
and
sixteen
lines
this
is
the
truth
the
whole
and
integral
truth
and
nothing
but
the
unexpurgated
truth
so
help
me
muse
she
blind
as
a
bat
and
satan
of
whom
i
writ
in
such
an
unbecoming
manner
that
henceforth
i
must
perforce
seek
my
future
elysian
in
other
haunts
than
those
of
the
above
named
cosmopoietic
own
for
fear
that
his
uncoped
wrath
may
blast
me
into
an
minstrel
or
like
one
varlet
draped
with
the
cognomen
of
nero
use
my
unbleached
bones
for
illuminating
the
highway
to
his
insidiate
lair
to
the
readers
this
question
may
present
itself
to
wit
why
place
hell
in
the
bowels
of
betelguese
why
not
the
sun
or
moon
in
the
first
instance
the
former
sphere
is
eliminated
as
a
possibility
on
account
of
its
nature
being
a
huge
nucleous
mass
of
aëriform
fluid
nothing
containing
animal
or
vegetable
life
could
possibly
exist
either
on
or
within
its
bowels
the
moon
too
is
excluded
for
the
same
reason
as
is
our
earth
it
having
at
one
time
been
a
part
of
the
latter
broken
off
by
one
of
the
giant
planets
long
before
the
pleioncene
era
betelguese
being
a
celestial
pariah
an
outcast
the
largest
of
all
known
comets
or
outlawed
suns
in
the
universe
and
further
so
long
as
hell
has
not
been
definitely
placed
why
not
figure
this
hybrid
planet
as
a
possibility
astronomers
throughout
the
world
remember
the
colossal
outburst
in
the
constellation
perseus
that
occurred
on
february
when
one
sun
exploded
or
two
made
collision
with
appalling
force
it
was
observed
through
telescopes
and
could
be
seen
with
the
naked
eye
in
full
daylight
both
suns
were
destroyed
as
suns
that
is
they
were
turned
into
thin
gas
and
vanished
from
sight
of
the
largest
telescope
within
less
than
a
year
had
each
sun
been
the
centre
of
a
system
of
eight
worlds
like
our
sun
and
imagine
each
world
sixteen
in
all
to
be
inhabited
with
human
beings
then
they
all
perished
in
a
short
time
after
collision
and
died
of
what
the
astronomers
call
fervent
heat
vega
far
more
larger
than
our
sun
appears
stationary
our
sun
with
its
family
of
moons
and
comets
is
moving
toward
it
at
the
fearful
pace
of
fourteen
miles
per
second
at
its
present
rate
of
speed
and
if
vega
is
really
a
fixed
planet
then
our
sun
would
reach
it
in
years
however
it
is
a
known
certainty
that
the
quantity
of
matter
that
is
invisible
is
so
much
greater
than
the
visible
that
the
visible
may
be
ignored
there
may
too
be
hundreds
of
millions
of
dark
bodies
extinct
constellations
far
larger
than
our
own
sun
any
one
of
these
could
approach
our
solar
system
and
annihilate
it
with
its
impact
for
in
passing
the
orbit
of
the
earth
on
their
way
around
the
sun
they
attain
a
regular
velocity
of
miles
per
second
if
one
of
these
dark
comets
should
overtake
the
earth
and
strike
it
the
velocity
of
impact
would
be
about
eight
miles
per
second
but
if
it
should
meet
the
earth
in
a
collision
the
speed
when
it
struck
would
be
miles
per
second
a
momentum
beyond
the
power
of
the
brain
to
fathom
indeed
man
can
not
think
of
sixty
miles
per
minute
let
a
solid
nucleous
collide
with
the
earth
and
imagination
would
reel
at
the
result
the
earth
moves
over
miles
every
second
and
this
added
to
or
subtracted
from
makes
or
if
a
comet
should
strike
at
right
angles
to
the
direction
of
the
earth
motion
the
speed
of
collision
would
be
miles
but
or
even
would
hurl
destruction
if
large
enough
a
visible
change
is
taking
place
in
the
giant
sun
betelguese
its
nebulæ
is
slowly
but
surely
disappearing
one
hundred
years
hence
it
may
be
a
dark
planet
invisible
to
even
the
most
powerful
telescope
however
hell
will
reign
on
through
eons
and
eons
and
if
this
sun
or
any
other
contains
its
kingdom
and
mankind
lives
for
another
thousand
years
or
more
those
who
should
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
miss
the
jagged
heights
to
paradise
need
not
worry
for
glozing
imps
will
lead
them
to
the
fasthold
of
typhon
weird
home
have
no
fear
september

when

when
i

in

my

me

who

on
that
aches

were
mine
untold
my
life
a
waste
from
which
there
stole

no

whilst
i
in

drown
what
