the
daffodil
fields
i
between
the
barren
pasture
and
the
wood
there
is
a
patch
of
grass
where
in
old
time
farmhouse
stood
and
human
fate
brought
tragic
things
to
pass
a
spring
comes
bubbling
up
there
cold
as
glass
it
bubbles
down
crusting
the
leaves
with
lime
babbling
the
song
that
it
has
sung
through
time
ducks
gobble
at
the
selvage
of
the
brook
but
still
it
slips
away
the
cold
past
the
lonely
woodland
nook
where
many
a
stubble
preens
her
wing
on
by
the
woodland
side
you
hear
it
sing
past
the
lone
copse
where
poachers
set
their
wires
past
the
green
hill
once
grim
with
sacrificial
fires
another
water
joins
it
then
it
turns
runs
through
the
ponton
wood
still
turning
west
past
foxgloves
canterbury
bells
and
ferns
and
many
a
many
a
nest
the
cattle
tread
it
there
then
with
a
zest
it
sparkles
out
babbling
its
pretty
chatter
through
foxholes
farm
where
it
gives
cattle
water
under
the
road
it
runs
and
now
it
slips
past
the
great
ploughland
babbling
drop
and
linn
to
the
stumps
of
elm
trees
which
it
lips
and
where
eddies
spin
then
on
its
left
some
fields
begin
and
pleasant
which
the
young
spring
fills
with
the
joy
of
dancing
daffodils
there
are
three
fields
where
daffodils
are
found
the
grass
is
dotted
with
their
leaves
their
nodding
beauty
shakes
along
the
ground
up
to
a
shutting
out
the
eaves
of
an
old
farm
where
always
the
wind
grieves
high
in
the
fir
boughs
moaning
people
call
this
farm
the
roughs
but
some
call
it
the
poor
hall
there
when
the
first
green
shoots
of
tender
corn
show
on
the
plough
when
the
first
drift
of
white
stars
the
black
branches
of
the
spiky
thorn
and
afternoons
are
warm
and
evenings
light
the
shivering
daffodils
do
take
delight
shaking
beside
the
brook
and
grass
comes
green
and
blue
come
and
glistening
celandine
and
there
the
pickers
come
picking
for
town
those
dancing
daffodils
all
day
they
pick
women
brown
or
the
colour
of
old
brick
at
noon
they
break
their
meats
under
the
rick
the
smoke
of
all
three
farms
lifts
blue
in
air
as
though
passionate
mind
had
never
suffered
there
and
sometimes
as
they
rest
an
old
man
comes
shepherd
or
carter
to
the
and
looks
upon
their
gangrel
tribe
and
hums
and
thinks
all
gone
to
wreck
since
master
died
and
sighs
over
a
passionate
which
red
sickle
reaped
under
those
hills
there
in
the
quiet
fields
among
the
daffodils
when
this
most
tragic
fate
had
time
and
place
and
human
hearts
and
minds
to
show
it
by
farmhouse
was
in
evil
case
its
master
nicholas
gray
was
like
to
die
he
lay
in
bed
watching
the
windy
sky
where
all
the
rooks
were
homing
on
slow
wings
cawing
or
blackly
circling
in
enormous
rings
with
a
sick
brain
he
watched
them
then
he
took
paper
and
pen
and
wrote
in
straggling
hand
like
legs
so
much
his
fingers
shook
word
to
the
friends
who
held
the
adjoining
land
bidding
them
come
no
more
he
could
command
his
fingers
twitching
to
the
feebling
blood
he
watched
his
last
sun
dip
down
behind
the
wood
while
all
his
thoughts
surged
about
his
brain
memories
and
pictures
clear
and
faces
known
long
dead
perhaps
he
was
a
child
again
treading
a
threshold
in
the
dark
alone
then
back
the
present
surged
making
him
moan
he
asked
if
keir
had
come
yet
no
they
said
nor
occleve
no
he
moaned
come
soon
or
be
dead
the
names
like
live
things
wandered
in
his
mind
charles
occleve
of
the
roughs
and
rowland
keir
keir
of
the
foxholes
but
his
brain
was
blind
a
blind
old
alley
in
the
storm
of
the
year
baffling
the
traveller
life
with
no
way
here
for
all
his
lantern
raised
life
would
not
tread
within
that
brain
again
along
those
pathways
red
soon
all
was
dimmed
but
in
the
heaven
one
star
hold
to
that
he
said
then
footsteps
stirred
down
in
the
court
a
voice
said
here
they
are
and
one
almost
gone
the
sick
man
heard
oh
god
be
quick
he
moaned
only
one
word
keir
occleve
let
them
come
why
they
come
why
stop
to
tell
them
that
the
devil
strike
you
dumb

in

in
curse

in
his
mind
the
sick
man
tossed
old
friends
he
said
i
once
had
hoped
to
see
mary

michael

but
fates
are
crossed
and
michael
starts
with
nothing
left
by

friend
will
stand
beside
my
girl
in
case
my
own
life
end
and
i
said
occleve
but
the
sick
man
seemed
still
ill
at
ease
my
friends
he
said
my
friends
michael
may
come
to
all
that
i
have
dreamed
but
a
wild
yarn
full
of
broken
ends
so
far
his
life
in
france
has
made
amends
god
grant
he
steady
so
but
girls
and
drink
once
brought
him
near
to
hell
aye
to
the
very
brink
there
is
a
running
vein
of
wildness
in
him
wildness
and
looseness
both
which
vices
make
that
task
a
hard
one
who
would
win
him
his
life
depends
upon
the
course
you
take
he
is
a
colt
to
break
and
one
to
curb
one
to
be
curbed
remember
the
dying
voice
died
down
the
fire
left
the
ember
but
once
again
it
flamed
ah
me
he
cried
our
secret
sins
take
body
in
our
sons
to
haunt
our
age
with
what
we
put
aside
i
was
a
devil
for
the
women
once
he
is
as
i
was
beauty
like
the
within
all
water
minded
like
the
moon
go
now
i
sinned
i
die
i
shall
be
punished
soon
the
two
friends
tiptoed
to
the
room
below
there
till
the
woman
came
to
them
they
told
of
brave
adventures
in
the
long
ago
ere
nick
and
they
had
thought
of
growing
old
in
the
marshlands
in
the
cold
old
soldiering
days
as
yeomen
days
at
fairs
days
that
had
sent
nick
tired
to
those
chairs
they
vowed
to
pay
the
schooling
for
his
son
they
talked
of
michael
testing
report
how
the
young
student
was
a
lively
one
handsome
and
passionate
both
and
fond
of
sport
eager
for
fun
in
retort
the
hearts
quick
to
see
him
cocking
by
young
april
on
a
blood
horse
with
a
roving
eye
and
as
they
talked
about
the
lad
keir
asked
if
son
had
not
at
one
time
been
heartsick
for
mary
though
with
passion
masked
ay
occleve
said
time
was
at
seventeen
it
took
him
hard
it
ran
his
ribs
all
lean
all
of
a
summer
but
it
passed
it
died
her
fancying
michael
better
touched
my
pride
mice
flickered
from
the
wainscot
to
the
press
nibbling
at
crumbs
rattling
to
shelter
squeaking
each
ticking
in
the
womb
made
life
less
oil
slowly
dropped
from
where
the
lamp
was
leaking
at
times
the
old
nurse
set
the
staircase
creaking
harked
to
the
breath
made
sure
returned
answered
the
questioning
eyes
then
wept
the
great
stars
burned
listen
said
occleve
listen
rowland
hark
mary
come
with
lion
answered
keir
they
said
come
together
after
dark
he
went
to
door
and
called
come
in
my
dear
the
burning
wood
log
blazed
with
sudden
cheer
so
that
a
glowing
lighted
all
the
room
his
daughter
mary
entered
from
the
outer
gloom
the
wind
had
brought
the
blood
into
her
cheek
heightening
her
beauty
but
her
great
grey
eyes
were
troubled
with
a
fear
she
could
not
speak
firm
scarlet
lips
she
had
not
made
for
lies
gentle
she
seemed
thoughtful
wise
and
when
she
asked
what
turn
the
sickness
took
her
passing
pureness
on
a
low
note
shook
young
lion
occleve
entered
at
her
side
a
clever
man
unduly
grave
one
whose
repute
already
travelled
wide
for
skill
in
breeding
beasts
his
features
gave
promise
of
brilliant
mind
brave
one
who
would
travel
far
his
manly
grace
grew
wistful
when
his
eyes
were
turned
on
face
tell
me
said
mary
what
did
doctor
say
how
ill
is
he
what
chance
of
life
has
he
the
cowman
said
he
last
the
day
and
only
yesterday
he
joked
with
me
we
must
be
meek
the
nurse
said
such
things
be
little
hope
said
keir
dying
sinking
dying
without
his
son
the
young
heart
was
thinking
does
michael
know
she
asked
has
he
been
called
a
slow
confusion
reddened
on
the
faces
as
when
one
light
neglect
leaves
friends
appalled
no
time
to
think
said
nurse
in
such
like
cases
old
occleve
stooped
and
fumbled
with
his
laces
let
be
he
said
always
time
for
sorrow
he
could
not
come
in
time
he
shall
be
called
there
is
a
chance
she
cried
there
always
is
poor
gray
might
rally
might
live
on
oh
i
must
telegraph
to
tell
him
this
would
it
were
day
still
and
the
message
gone
she
rose
her
breath
came
fast
her
grey
eyes
shone
she
said
come
lion
see
me
through
the
wood
michael
must
know
keir
sighed
girl
it
will
do
no
good
our
friend
is
on
the
brink
and
almost
passed
all
the
more
need
she
said
for
word
to
go
michael
could
well
arrive
before
the
last
see
his
face
at
least
i
know
the
office
may
be
closed
but
even
so
father
i
must
come
lion
out
they
went
into
the
roaring
woodland
where
the
saplings
bent
like
breakers
of
the
sea
the
leafless
branches
swished
bowing
down
rolling
like
water
roaring
like
the
welcome
when
the
clipper
launches
and
full
affronted
tideways
call
to
warring
daffodils
glimmered
underfoot
the
flooring
of
the
earthy
woodland
smelt
like
moss
stones
in
the
path
showed
white
and
rabbits
ran
across
they
climbed
the
rise
and
struck
into
the
ride
talking
of
death
while
lion
sick
at
heart
thought
of
the
woman
walking
at
his
side
and
as
he
talked
his
spirit
stood
apart
old
passion
for
her
made
his
being
smart
rankling
within
her
thought
for
michael
ran
like
glory
and
like
poison
through
his
inner
man
this
will
break
heart
he
said
at
length
poor
michael
she
replied
they
wasted
hours
he
loved
his
father
so
god
give
him
strength
this
is
a
cruel
thing
this
life
of
ours
the
windy
woodland
glimmered
with
shut
flowers
white
wood
anemones
that
the
wind
blew
down
the
valley
opened
wide
beyond
the
starry
town
ten
clanged
out
of
the
belfry
lion
stayed
one
hand
upon
a
bole
mary
he
said
dear
my
beloved
maid
i
love
you
dear
one
from
my
very
soul
her
beauty
in
the
dusk
destroyed
control
mary
my
dear
loved
you
all
these
years
oh
lion
no
she
murmured
choking
back
her
tears
i
love
you
he
repeated
five
years
since
this
thing
began
between
us
every
day
oh
sweet
the
thought
of
you
has
made
me
wince
the
thought
of
you
my
sweet
the
look
the
way
only
you
whether
i
work
or
pray
you
and
the
hope
of
you
sweet
you
dear
you
i
never
spoke
before
now
it
has
broken
through
oh
my
beloved
can
you
care
for
me
she
shook
her
head
oh
hush
oh
lion
dear
speak
of
love
for
it
can
never
be
between
us
two
never
however
near
come
on
my
friend
we
must
not
linger
here
white
to
the
lips
she
spoke
he
saw
her
face
white
in
the
darkness
by
him
in
the
windy
place
mary
in
time
you
could
perhaps
he
pleaded
no
she
replied
no
lion
never
no
over
the
stars
the
boughs
burst
and
receded
the
nobleness
of
love
comes
in
woe
god
bless
you
then
beloved
let
us
go
come
on
he
said
and
if
i
gave
you
pain
forget
it
dear
be
sure
i
never
will
again
they
stepped
together
down
the
ride
their
feet
slipped
on
loose
stones
little
was
said
his
fate
staked
on
a
kingly
cast
had
met
defeat
nothing
remained
but
to
endure
and
wait
she
was
still
wonderful
and
life
still
great
great
in
that
bitter
instant
side
by
side
hallowed
by
thoughts
of
death
there
in
the
blinded
ride
he
heard
her
breathing
by
him
saw
her
face
dim
looking
straight
ahead
her
feet
by
his
kept
time
beside
him
giving
life
a
grace
night
made
the
moment
full
of
mysteries
you
are
beautiful
he
thought
and
life
is
this
walking
a
windy
night
while
men
are
dying
to
cry
for
one
to
come
and
none
to
heed
our
crying
mary
he
said
are
you
in
love
with
him
with
michael
tell
me
we
are
friends
we
three
they
paused
to
face
each
other
in
the
dim
tell
me
he
urged
yes
lion
answered
she
i
love
him
but
he
does
not
care
for
me
i
trust
your
generous
mind
dear
now
you
know
you
who
have
been
my
brother
how
our
fortunes
go
now
come
the
message
waits
the
heavens
cleared
cleared
and
were
starry
as
they
trod
the
ride
chequered
by
tossing
boughs
the
moon
appeared
a
whistling
reached
them
from
the
hall
house
side
climbing
the
whistler
came
a
brown
owl
cried
the
whistler
paused
to
answer
sending
far
that
haunting
hunting
note
the
echoes
laughed
aha
something
about
the
calling
made
them
start
again
the
owl
note
laughed
the
ringing
cry
made
the
blood
quicken
within
heart
like
a
dead
leaf
a
brown
owl
floated
by
michael
said
lion
hush
an
reply
came
down
the
wind
they
waited
then
the
man
content
resumed
his
walk
a
merry
song
began
michael
they
cried
together
michael
you
who
calls
the
singer
answered
where
away
is
that
you
mary
then
with
glad
halloo
the
singer
ran
to
meet
them
on
the
way
it
was
their
michael
in
the
moonlight
grey
they
made
warm
welcome
under
tossing
boughs
they
met
and
told
the
fate
darkening
house
as
they
returned
at
speed
their
comrade
spoke
strangely
and
lightly
of
his
coming
home
saying
that
leaving
france
had
been
a
joke
but
that
events
now
proved
him
wise
to
come
down
the
steep
to
the
house
they
clomb
and
michael
faltered
in
his
pace
they
heard
how
dumb
rebellion
in
the
cattle
stirred
and
as
they
came
high
from
the
sick
room
old
gray
burst
out
of
the
light
streaming
upon
him
from
the
outer
gloom
as
his
eyes
dying
gave
him
mental
sight
triumphing
swords
he
carolled
in
the
bright
oh
fire
oh
beauty
fire
and
fell
back
dead
occleve
took
michael
up
to
kneel
beside
the
bed
so
the
night
passed
the
noisy
wind
went
down
the
moon
her
starry
trackway
rode
then
the
first
fire
was
lighted
in
the
town
and
the
first
carter
stacked
his
early
load
upon
the
drawn
blinds
the
morning
glowed
and
down
the
valley
with
little
clucks
and
trills
the
dancing
waters
danced
by
dancing
daffodils
ii
they
buried
gray
his
gear
was
sold
his
farm
passed
to
another
tenant
thus
men
go
the
dropped
sword
passes
to
another
arm
and
different
waters
in
the
river
flow
his
two
old
faithful
friends
let
michael
know
his
ruin
and
their
promise
keir
brought
him
to
stay
at
foxholes
till
a
path
was
clear
there
when
the
sale
was
over
all
three
met
to
talk
about
the
future
and
to
find
upon
what
project
heart
was
set
gentle
the
two
old
men
were
thoughtful
kind
they
urged
the
youth
to
speak
his
inmost
mind
for
they
would
compass
what
he
chose
they
told
how
he
might
end
his
training
they
would
find
the
gold
thanks
but
i
can
not
michael
said
he
smiled
can
not
kicked
me
out
been
expelled
kicked
out
for
good
and
all
for
being
wild
they
stopped
our
evening
leave
and
i
rebelled
i
am
a
gentle
soul
until
compelled
and
then
i
put
my
ears
back
the
old
fool
said
that
my
longer
presence
might
inflame
the
school
and
i
am
glad
for
i
have
had
my
fill
of
farming
by
the
book
with
those
old
fools
exhausted
talkatives
whose
blood
is
still
who
strive
to
bind
a
living
man
with
rules
this
fettered
kind
of
life
these
laws
these
schools
these
codes
these
checks
what
are
they
but
the
clogs
made
by
collected
sheep
to
mortify
the
dogs
and
i
have
had
enough
of
them
and
now
i
make
an
end
of
them
i
want
to
go
somewhere
where
man
has
never
used
a
plough
nor
ever
read
a
book
where
clean
winds
blow
and
passionate
blood
is
not
its
foe
and
land
is
for
the
asking
for
it
there
man
can
create
a
life
and
have
the
open
air
the
river
the
country
there
i
know
a
man
like
me
can
thrive
there
on
the
range
the
cattle
pass
like
tides
they
ebb
and
flow
and
life
is
changeless
in
unending
change
and
one
can
ride
all
day
and
all
day
strange
strange
never
trodden
fenceless
waiting
there
to
feed
unending
cattle
for
the
men
who
dare
there
i
should
have
a
chance
this
too
old
old
occleve
grunted
at
the
young
mood
keir
who
was
losing
money
thought
him
bold
and
thought
the
scheme
for
emigration
good
he
said
that
if
he
wished
to
go
he
should
south
to
the
pampas
there
to
learn
the
trade
old
occleve
thought
it
mad
but
no
objection
made
so
it
was
settled
that
the
lad
should
start
a
place
was
found
for
him
a
berth
was
taken
and
beauty
plucked
at
heart
and
now
the
fabric
of
their
lives
was
shaken
for
now
the
nearness
made
love
waken
in
heart
for
mary
now
guile
granted
her
passionate
prayer
nor
let
her
see
his
smile
granted
his
greatest
gifts
a
night
time
came
when
the
two
walking
down
the
water
learned
that
life
till
then
had
only
been
a
name
love
had
unsealed
their
spirits
they
discerned
mutely
at
moth
time
there
their
spirits
yearned
i
shall
be
gone
three
years
dear
soul
he
said
dear
will
you
wait
for
me
i
will
replied
the
maid
so
troth
was
pledged
between
them
keir
received
michael
as
suitor
feeling
sure
that
the
fortunes
would
be
soon
retrieved
having
a
promise
as
a
lure
the
three
wait
would
teach
them
to
endure
he
bade
them
love
and
prosper
and
be
glad
and
fast
the
day
drew
near
that
was
to
take
the
lad
cowslips
had
come
along
the
bubbling
brook
cowslips
and
oxlips
rare
and
in
the
wood
the
stalks
of
bluebells
shook
the
outward
beauty
fed
their
mental
mood
thought
of
the
parting
stabbed
her
as
he
wooed
walking
the
brook
with
her
and
day
by
day
the
precious
grace
dropped
wasted
slipped
away
till
only
one
clear
day
remained
to
her
one
whole
clear
precious
day
before
he
sailed
some
forty
hours
no
more
to
minister
to
months
of
bleakness
before
which
she
quailed
mist
rose
along
the
brook
the
corncrake
railed
dim
red
the
sunset
burned
he
bade
her
come
into
the
wood
with
him
they
went
the
night
came
dumb
still
as
high
june
the
very
noise
seemed
but
a
breathing
of
the
earth
the
flowers
stood
in
the
dim
like
souls
without
a
voice
the
conspiracy
of
occult
powers
drew
all
about
them
and
for
hours
on
hours
no
murmur
shook
the
oaks
the
stars
did
house
their
lights
like
lamps
upon
those
boughs
under
their
feet
the
woodland
sloped
away
down
to
the
valley
where
the
farmhouse
lights
were
sparks
in
the
expanse
the
moon
made
grey
very
breast
was
bare
this
night
of
nights
moths
blundered
up
against
them
greys
and
whites
moved
on
the
darkness
where
the
moths
were
out
nosing
for
sticky
sweet
with
trembling
uncurled
snout
but
all
this
beauty
was
but
music
played
while
the
high
pageant
of
their
hearts
prepared
a
spirit
thrilled
between
them
man
to
maid
mind
flowed
in
mind
the
inner
heart
was
bared
they
needed
not
to
tell
how
much
each
cared
all
the
strength
was
at
the
soul
flesh
was
away
awhile
a
glory
made
them
whole
nothing
was
said
by
them
they
understood
they
searched
each
eyes
without
a
sound
alone
with
moonlight
in
the
heart
of
the
wood
knowing
the
stars
and
all
the
soul
of
the
ground
mary
he
murmured
come
his
arms
went
round
a
white
moth
glimmered
by
the
woods
were
hushed
the
rose
at
bosom
dropped
its
petals
crushed
no
word
profaned
the
peace
of
that
glad
giving
but
the
warm
dimness
of
the
night
stood
still
drawing
all
beauty
to
the
point
of
living
there
in
the
shadow
on
the
hill
spirit
to
spirit
murmured
mingling
will
made
them
one
being
decaying
thought
fell
from
them
like
a
rag
it
was
the
soul
they
sought
the
moonlight
found
an
opening
in
the
boughs
it
entered
in
it
filled
that
sacred
place
with
consecration
on
the
throbbing
brows
it
came
with
benediction
and
with
grace
a
whispering
came
from
face
to
yearning
face
beloved
will
you
wait
for
me
my
own
i
shall
be
gone
three
years
you
will
be
left
alone
trust
and
wait
for
me
yes
yes
she
sighed
she
would
wait
any
term
of
years
all
time
so
faithful
to
first
love
these
souls
abide
carrying
a
soul
with
them
as
they
climb
life
was
all
flower
to
them
the
church
chime
rang
out
the
burning
hour
ere
they
had
sealed
charter
there
below
the
june
starry
field
sweetly
the
church
music
reached
the
wood
chiming
an
old
slow
tune
of
some
old
hymn
calling
them
back
to
life
from
where
they
stood
under
the
moonlit
grey
and
dim
mary
he
murmured
pressing
close
to
him
her
kiss
came
on
the
gift
he
gave
her
there
a
silken
scarf
that
bore
her
name
worked
in
his
hair
but
still
the
two
affixed
their
hands
and
seals
to
a
life
compact
witnessed
by
the
sky
where
the
great
planets
drove
their
glittering
wheels
bringing
conflicting
fate
making
men
die
they
loved
and
she
would
wait
and
he
would
try
oh
beauty
of
my
love
my
lovely
man
so
beauty
made
them
noble
for
their
little
span
time
can
not
pause
however
dear
the
wooer
the
moon
declined
the
sunrise
came
the
hours
left
to
the
lovers
dwindled
swiftly
fewer
even
as
the
seeds
from
blow
one
by
one
until
the
bare
stalk
cowers
and
the
june
grass
grows
over
even
so
time
took
from
their
lives
the
glow
stole
their
last
walk
along
the
three
green
fields
their
latest
hour
together
he
took
he
stole
the
white
contentment
that
a
true
love
yields
he
took
the
triumph
out
of
soul
now
she
must
lie
awake
and
blow
the
coal
of
sorrow
of
heart
the
parting
hour
came
they
kissed
their
last
murmuring
the
name
then
the
flag
waved
the
engine
snorted
then
slowly
the
couplings
tautened
and
the
train
moved
bearing
off
from
her
her
man
of
men
she
looked
towards
its
going
blind
with
pain
her
father
turned
and
drove
her
home
again
it
was
a
different
home
awhile
she
tried
to
cook
the
dinner
there
but
flung
her
down
and
cried
then
in
the
dusk
she
wandered
down
the
brook
treading
again
the
trackway
trod
of
old
when
she
could
hold
her
loved
one
in
a
look
the
night
was
all
unlike
those
nights
of
gold
michael
was
gone
and
all
the
april
old
withered
and
hidden
life
was
full
of
ills
she
flung
her
down
and
cried
the
withered
daffodils
iii
the
steaming
river
loitered
like
old
blood
on
which
the
tugboat
bearing
michael
beat
past
whitened
horse
bones
sticking
in
the
mud
the
reed
stems
looked
like
metal
in
the
heat
then
the
banks
fell
away
and
there
were
neat
red
herds
of
sullen
cattle
drifting
slow
a
fish
leaped
making
rings
making
the
dead
blood
flow
wormed
piles
were
in
the
river
bank
the
steamer
threshed
alongside
with
sick
screws
churning
the
mud
below
her
till
it
stank
big
gassy
burst
on
the
ooze
there
michael
went
ashore
as
glad
to
lose
one
not
a
native
there
the
gauchos
flung
his
broken
gear
ashore
one
waved
a
bell
was
rung
the
bowfast
was
cast
off
the
screw
revolved
making
a
bloodier
bubbling
rattling
rope
fell
to
the
hatch
the
tune
resolved
into
its
steadier
beat
of
rise
and
slope
the
steamer
went
her
way
and
hope
died
as
she
lessened
he
was
there
alone
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
made
a
gradual
moan
he
thought
of
mary
but
the
thought
was
dim
that
was
another
life
lived
long
before
his
mind
was
in
new
worlds
which
altered
him
the
startling
present
left
no
room
for
more
the
sullen
river
lipped
the
sky
the
shore
were
vaster
than
of
old
and
lonely
lonely
sky
and
low
hills
of
grass
and
moaning
cattle
only
but
for
a
hut
bestrewn
with
skulls
of
beeves
round
which
the
flies
danced
where
an
indian
girl
bleared
at
him
from
her
ophthalmic
eaves
grinning
a
welcome
with
a
throaty
skirl
she
offered
him
herself
but
he
the
churl
stared
till
she
thought
him
fool
she
turned
she
sat
scratched
in
her
short
black
hair
chewed
a
spat
up
on
the
rise
the
cattle
bunched
the
bulls
drew
to
the
front
with
menace
pawing
bold
snatching
the
out
with
sudden
pulls
the
distant
cattle
raised
their
heads
the
wold
grew
dusty
at
the
top
a
waggon
rolled
drawn
by
a
bickering
team
of
mules
whose
eyes
were
yellow
like
their
teeth
and
bared
and
full
of
vice
down
to
the
jetty
came
the
jingling
team
an
irish
cowboy
driving
while
a
greek
beside
him
urged
the
mules
with
blow
and
scream
they
cheered
the
indian
girl
and
stopped
to
speak
then
lifting
her
aloft
they
kissed
her
cheek
calling
to
michael
to
be
quick
aboard
or
they
they
said
would
fall
from
virtue
by
the
lord
so
michael
climbed
aboard
and
all
day
long
he
drove
the
cattle
range
rise
after
rise
dotted
with
limber
shorthorns
grazing
strong
cropping
pasture
switching
flies
dull
trouble
brooded
in
their
smoky
eyes
some
horsemen
watched
them
as
the
sun
went
down
the
waggon
reached
the
estancia
builded
like
a
town
with
wide
corrales
where
the
horses
squealed
biting
and
lashing
out
some
hounds
gnawed
at
the
cowbones
littered
on
the
field
or
made
the
stallions
stretch
their
picket
bounds
some
hides
were
drying
horsemen
came
from
rounds
unsaddled
stiff
and
turned
their
mounts
to
feed
and
then
brewed
bitter
drink
and
sucked
it
through
a
reed
the
irishman
removed
his
pipe
and
spoke
you
take
a
advice
he
said
return
go
back
where
you
belong
before
broke
spoil
more
clothes
at
this
job
than
earn
living
death
and
when
you
die
burn
body
and
soul
it
takes
you
quit
it
no
say
i
never
told
you
then
amigos
ho
here
comes
a
gringo
make
him
pay
his
shot
pay
up
your
footing
michael
the
word
it
suits
my
genius
and
i
need
a
lot
so
the
great
cauldron
full
was
mixed
and
stirred
and
all
night
long
the
startled
cattle
heard
shouting
and
shooting
and
the
moon
beheld
mobs
of
dim
struggling
men
who
fired
guns
and
yelled
that
they
were
abel
brown
just
come
to
town
michael
among
them
by
a
bonfire
some
betted
on
red
and
black
for
money
down
snatching
their
clinking
winnings
eager
dumb
some
danced
unclad
rubbing
their
heads
with
rum
the
grey
dawn
bringing
beauty
to
the
skies
saw
michael
stretched
among
them
far
too
drunk
to
rise
his
footing
paid
he
joined
the
lined
with
rude
bunks
and
set
with
trestles
there
he
like
the
other
ranchers
slept
and
fed
save
when
the
staff
encamped
in
open
air
rounding
the
herd
for
branding
rude
and
bare
that
barrack
was
men
littered
it
about
with
saddles
blankets
blue
old
headstalls
many
a
clout
torn
off
to
wipe
a
knife
or
clean
a
gun
tin
dishes
hookpots
all
the
mess
made
where
the
outdoor
work
is
never
done
and
every
cleaning
makes
the
sleeping
less
men
came
from
work
too
tired
to
undress
and
slept
all
standing
like
the
horse
then
with
the
sun
they
rose
to
ride
the
burning
course
whacking
the
shipment
cattle
into
pen
where
in
the
dust
among
the
stink
of
burning
the
heifers
bolted
from
the
men
and
tossing
horns
arose
and
hoofs
were
churning
a
lover
there
had
little
time
for
yearning
but
all
day
long
cursing
the
flies
and
heat
michael
was
handling
steers
on
horseback
till
his
feet
gave
on
dismounting
all
day
long
he
rode
then
when
the
darkness
came
his
mates
and
he
entered
to
the
rude
abode
and
ate
their
meat
and
sucked
their
bitter
tea
and
rolled
themselves
in
rugs
and
slept
the
sea
could
not
make
men
more
drowsy
like
the
dead
they
lay
under
the
lamp
while
the
mosquitoes
fed
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
mary
none
for
when
the
work
relaxed
the
time
for
thought
was
broken
up
by
men
demanding
fun
cards
or
a
ring
while
someone
fought
or
songs
and
dancing
or
a
case
was
bought
of
white
brazilian
rum
and
songs
and
cheers
and
shots
and
oaths
rang
loud
upon
the
twitching
ears
of
the
hobbled
horses
hopping
to
their
feed
so
violent
images
displaced
the
rose
in
spirit
soon
he
took
the
lead
none
was
more
apt
than
he
for
games
or
blows
even
as
the
bantam
crows
so
crowed
the
cockerel
of
his
mind
to
feel
bonds
removed
and
blood
quick
in
him
toe
to
heel
but
sometimes
when
her
letters
came
to
him
full
of
wise
tenderness
and
maiden
mind
he
felt
that
he
had
let
his
clearness
dim
the
riot
with
the
cowboys
seemed
unkind
to
that
far
faithful
heart
he
could
not
find
peace
in
the
thought
of
her
he
found
no
spur
to
instant
upright
action
in
his
love
for
her
she
faded
to
the
memory
of
a
kiss
there
in
the
rough
life
among
foreign
faces
love
can
not
live
where
leisure
never
is
he
could
not
write
to
her
from
savage
places
where
drunken
mates
were
betting
on
the
aces
and
rum
went
round
and
smutty
songs
were
lifted
he
would
not
raise
her
banner
against
that
he
drifted
ceasing
in
time
to
write
ceasing
to
think
but
happy
in
the
wild
life
to
the
bone
the
riding
in
vast
space
the
songs
the
drink
some
careless
heart
beside
him
like
his
own
the
racing
and
the
fights
the
ease
unknown
in
older
soberer
lands
his
young
blood
thrilled
the
pampas
seemed
his
own
his
cup
of
joy
was
filled
and
one
day
riding
far
after
strayed
horses
he
rode
beyond
the
ranges
to
a
land
broken
and
made
most
green
by
watercourses
which
served
as
strayline
to
the
neighbouring
brand
a
house
stood
near
the
brook
he
stayed
his
hand
seeing
a
woman
there
whose
great
eyes
burned
so
that
he
could
not
choose
but
follow
when
she
turned
after
that
day
he
often
rode
to
see
that
woman
at
the
peach
farm
near
the
brook
and
passionate
love
between
them
came
to
be
ere
many
days
their
fill
of
love
they
took
and
even
as
the
blank
leaves
of
a
book
the
days
went
over
mary
day
by
day
blank
as
the
last
was
turned
endured
passed
turned
away
spring
came
again
greening
the
hawthorn
buds
the
shaking
flowers
seemed
the
same
and
april
put
her
riot
in
young
bloods
the
jays
flapped
in
the
larch
clump
like
blue
flame
she
did
not
care
his
letter
never
came
silent
she
went
nursing
the
grief
that
kills
and
lion
watched
her
pass
among
the
daffodils
iv
time
passed
but
still
no
letter
came
she
ceased
almost
to
hope
but
never
to
expect
the
june
moon
came
which
had
beheld
feast
then
waned
like
it
the
was
flecked
with
which
died
little
she
recked
of
change
in
outward
things
she
did
not
change
her
heart
still
knew
one
star
one
hope
it
did
not
range
like
to
the
watery
hearts
of
tidal
men
swayed
by
all
moons
of
beauty
she
was
firm
when
most
convinced
of
misery
firmest
then
she
held
a
light
not
subject
to
the
worm
the
pageant
of
the
summer
ran
its
term
the
last
stack
came
to
staddle
from
the
wain
the
snow
fell
the
snow
thawed
the
year
began
again
with
the
wet
glistening
gold
of
celandines
and
snowdrops
pushing
from
the
withered
grass
before
the
bud
upon
the
hawthorn
greens
or
blackbirds
go
to
building
but
alas
no
spring
within
her
bosom
came
to
pass
going
like
a
ghost
her
father
said
now
put
him
out
of
mind
and
be
my
prudent
maid
it
was
an
april
morning
brisk
with
wind
she
wandered
out
along
the
brook
picking
the
daffodils
where
the
water
dinned
while
overhead
the
swallow
darted
there
at
the
place
where
all
the
passion
started
where
love
first
knocked
about
her
maiden
heart
young
lion
occleve
hailed
her
calling
her
apart
to
see
his
tulips
at
the
roughs
and
take
a
spray
of
flowering
currant
so
she
went
it
is
a
bitter
moment
when
hearts
ache
to
see
the
loved
unhappy
his
intent
was
but
to
try
to
comfort
her
he
meant
to
show
her
that
he
knew
her
despair
and
that
his
own
heart
bled
to
see
her
wretched
there
so
as
they
talked
he
asked
her
had
she
heard
from
michael
lately
no
she
had
not
she
had
been
a
great
while
now
without
a
word
no
news
is
always
good
news
answered
he
you
know
he
said
how
much
you
mean
to
me
always
been
the
queen
oh
if
i
could
do
anything
to
help
my
dear
you
know
i
would
nothing
she
said
much
touched
but
you
believe
you
still
believe
in
him
why
yes
he
said
lie
though
it
was
he
did
not
dare
deceive
the
all
too
cruel
faith
within
the
maid
that
ranching
is
a
wild
and
lonely
trade
far
from
all
posts
it
may
be
hard
to
send
all
puzzling
things
like
this
prove
simple
in
the
end
we
should
have
heard
if
he
were
ill
or
dead
keep
a
good
heart
now
come
he
led
the
way
beyond
the
barton
to
the
where
on
a
strawy
litter
topped
with
hay
a
prize
lay
near
three
weeks
old
he
said
the
pet
come
up
now
son
come
up
you
seen
him
yet
we
have
done
well
he
added
with
the
stock
but
this
one
if
he
lives
will
make
a
name
the
gambolled
with
his
tail
acock
then
shyly
nosed
towards
them
scared
but
tame
his
troublous
eyes
were
sulky
with
blue
flame
softly
he
shying
at
a
touch
he
nosed
his
breath
came
sweet
his
pale
tongue
curled
to
clutch
they
rubbed
his
head
and
mary
went
her
way
counting
the
dreary
time
the
dreary
beat
of
dreary
minutes
dragging
through
the
day
time
crawled
across
her
life
with
leaden
feet
there
still
remained
a
year
before
her
sweet
would
come
to
claim
her
surely
he
would
come
meanwhile
there
was
the
year
her
weakening
father
home
home
with
its
deadly
round
with
all
its
setting
things
rooms
and
fields
and
flowers
to
sting
to
burn
with
memories
of
the
love
time
past
forgetting
ere
absence
made
her
very
being
yearn
my
love
be
quick
she
moaned
return
return
come
when
the
three
years
end
oh
my
dear
soul
bitter
wanting
you
the
lonely
nights
took
toll
putting
a
sadness
where
the
beauty
was
taking
a
lustre
from
the
hair
the
days
saw
each
a
sadder
image
in
the
glass
and
when
december
came
fouling
the
ways
and
ashless
made
a
christmas
blaze
some
talk
of
michael
came
a
rumour
ran
someone
had
called
him
wild
to
some
returning
mail
who
travelling
through
that
had
heard
nothing
more
sure
than
this
but
this
he
told
at
upon
a
word
it
struck
on
heart
and
turned
her
cold
that
winter
was
an
age
which
made
her
old
but
soon
she
thought
soon
the
third
year
will
end
march
april
may
and
june
then
i
shall
see
my
friend
he
promised
he
would
come
he
will
not
fail
oh
michael
my
beloved
man
come
soon
stay
not
to
make
a
home
for
me
but
sail
love
and
the
hour
will
put
the
world
in
tune
you
in
my
life
for
always
is
the
boon
i
ask
from
life
we
two
together
lovers
so
leaden
time
went
by
who
eats
things
and
discovers
then
in
the
winds
of
march
her
father
rode
hunting
the
welland
country
on
black
ned
the
tenor
cry
gave
tongue
past
lode
and
on
he
galloped
giving
the
nag
his
head
then
at
the
brook
he
fell
was
picked
up
dead
hounds
were
whipped
off
men
muttered
with
one
breath
we
knew
that
brute
would
some
day
be
his
death
they
bore
his
body
on
a
hurdle
home
then
came
the
burial
then
the
sadder
day
when
the
peaked
lawyer
entered
like
a
gnome
with
word
to
quit
and
lists
of
debts
to
pay
there
was
a
sale
the
foxholes
passed
away
to
strangers
who
discussed
the
points
of
cows
where
love
had
put
such
glory
on
the
brows
kind
lion
occleve
helped
the
affairs
her
sorrow
brought
him
much
beside
her
he
caused
her
to
settle
having
stilled
her
cares
in
the
long
cottage
under
spital
gree
he
had
no
hope
that
she
would
love
him
she
still
waited
for
her
lover
but
her
eyes
thanked
lion
to
the
soul
he
made
the
look
suffice
by
this
the
yearling
had
so
grown
that
all
men
talked
of
him
mighty
he
grew
scaled
above
a
hundred
stone
with
deep
chest
with
great
thew
and
the
occleves
knew
that
he
surpassed
his
pasture
breeders
came
from
far
to
see
this
bull
he
brought
the
occleves
fame
till
a
rancher
on
the
plains
where
michael
wasted
sent
to
buy
the
beast
meaning
to
cross
his
cows
with
heavier
strains
until
his
yield
of
meat
and
bone
increased
he
paid
a
mighty
price
the
yearling
ceased
to
be
the
wonder
of
the
countryside
he
sailed
in
charge
south
to
the
red
tide
there
lion
landed
with
the
bull
and
there
the
great
beast
raised
his
head
and
bellowed
loud
challenging
that
expanse
and
that
new
air
trembling
but
full
of
wrath
and
far
from
the
daffodil
fields
and
friends
but
proud
his
wild
eye
kindled
at
the
great
expanse
two
scraps
of
shropshire
life
they
stood
there
their
advance
was
slow
along
the
cattle
land
but
at
the
last
an
end
was
made
the
brute
ate
his
last
bread
crust
from
his
hand
and
snuffed
the
foreign
herd
and
stamped
his
foot
steers
on
the
swelling
ranges
gave
salute
the
great
bull
bellowed
back
and
lion
turned
his
task
was
now
to
find
where
michael
lived
he
learned
the
direction
and
with
heavy
mind
thinking
of
mary
and
her
sorrow
rode
leaving
the
offspring
of
his
fields
behind
a
last
time
in
his
ears
the
great
bull
lowed
then
shaking
up
his
horse
the
young
man
glowed
to
see
the
unfenced
pampas
opening
out
grass
that
makes
old
earth
sing
and
all
the
valleys
shout
at
sunset
on
the
second
day
he
came
to
that
white
cabin
in
the
plot
where
michael
lived
they
met
the
shropshire
name
rang
trebly
dear
in
that
outlandish
spot
old
memories
swam
up
dear
old
joys
forgot
old
friends
were
real
again
but
woe
came
into
mind
and
michael
vexed
him
so
talking
with
careless
freshness
side
by
side
with
that
dark
spanish
beauty
who
had
won
as
though
no
woman
mourned
for
him
over
sea
as
though
the
sun
shone
but
to
light
his
steps
to
love
and
fun
while
she
that
golden
and
beloved
soul
worth
ten
of
him
lay
wasting
like
an
unlit
coal
so
supper
passed
the
meat
in
gorge
stuck
at
the
last
he
could
not
bide
that
face
the
idle
laughter
on
it
plied
the
forge
where
hate
was
smithying
tools
the
jokes
the
place
wrought
him
to
wrath
he
could
not
stay
for
grace
the
tin
mug
full
of
red
wine
spilled
and
fell
he
kicked
his
stool
aside
with
michael
this
is
hell
come
out
into
the
night
and
talk
to
me
the
young
man
lit
a
cigarette
and
followed
the
stars
seemed
trembling
at
a
brink
to
see
a
little
ghostly
stooped
and
holloed
beside
the
lion
stopped
and
swallowed
while
all
the
wrath
within
him
made
him
grey
michael
stood
still
and
smoked
and
flicked
his
ash
away
well
lion
michael
said
men
make
mistakes
and
then
regret
them
and
an
early
flame
is
frequently
the
worst
mistake
man
makes
i
did
not
seek
this
passion
but
it
came
love
happens
so
in
life
well
to
blame
say
broken
heart
the
heart
is
not
the
whole
of
life
but
an
inferior
part
useful
for
some
few
years
and
then
a
curse
nerves
should
be
stronger
you
have
come
to
say
the
term
is
up
so
much
the
worse
i
can
not
meet
the
bill
i
can
not
pay
i
would
not
if
i
could
men
change
i
know
that
that
first
choice
however
sweet
was
wrong
and
a
mistake
it
would
have
meant
defeat
ruin
and
misery
to
us
both
let
be
you
say
i
should
have
told
her
this
perhaps
you
try
to
make
a
loving
woman
see
that
the
warm
link
which
holds
you
to
her
snaps
neglect
is
deadlier
than
the
yet
she
is
bright
and
i
am
water
well
i
did
not
make
myself
this
life
is
often
hell
judge
if
you
must
but
understand
it
first
we
are
old
friends
and
townsmen
shropshire
born
under
the
wrekin
you
believe
the
worst
you
have
no
knowledge
how
the
heart
is
torn
trying
for
duty
up
against
the
thorn
now
say
broken
heart
begin
break
hers
or
hers
and
mine
which
were
the
greater
sin
michael
said
lion
i
have
heard
you
now
listen
to
me
three
years
ago
you
made
with
a
most
noble
soul
a
certain
vow
now
you
reject
it
saying
that
you
played
she
did
not
think
so
michael
she
has
stayed
eating
her
heart
out
for
a
line
a
word
news
that
you
were
not
dead
news
that
she
never
heard
not
once
after
the
first
she
has
held
firm
to
what
you
counted
pastime
she
has
wept
life
day
by
weary
day
throughout
the
term
while
her
heart
sickened
and
the
crept
while
you
you
with
your
woman
here
have
kept
holiday
feasting
you
are
fat
you
smile
you
have
had
love
and
laughter
all
the
ghastly
while
i
shall
be
back
in
england
six
weeks
hence
standing
with
your
poor
mary
face
to
face
far
from
a
pleasant
moment
but
intense
i
shall
be
asked
to
tell
her
of
this
place
and
she
will
eye
me
hard
and
hope
for
grace
some
little
crumb
of
comfort
while
i
tell
and
every
word
will
burn
like
a
red
spark
from
hell
that
you
have
done
with
her
that
you
are
living
here
with
another
woman
that
you
care
nought
for
the
pain
given
and
are
giving
that
all
your
vows
were
empty
air
this
i
must
tell
thus
i
shall
burn
her
bare
burn
out
all
hope
all
comfort
every
crumb
end
it
and
watch
her
whiten
hopeless
tearless
dumb
or
do
i
judge
you
wrongly
he
was
still
the
glowed
and
dimmed
with
ash
a
preying
night
bird
whimpered
on
the
hill
michael
said
ah
and
fingered
with
his
sash
then
stilled
the
night
was
still
there
came
no
flash
of
sudden
passion
bursting
all
was
still
a
lonely
water
gurgled
like
a
now
i
must
go
said
lion
the
horse
there
said
his
friend
set
you
on
your
way
they
caught
and
rode
both
silent
while
remorse
worked
in
each
heart
though
neither
would
betray
what
he
was
feeling
and
the
moon
came
grey
then
burned
into
an
opal
white
and
great
silvering
the
downs
of
grass
where
these
two
travelled
late
thinking
of
english
fields
which
that
moon
saw
fields
full
of
quiet
beauty
lying
hushed
at
midnight
in
the
moment
full
of
awe
when
the
red
fox
comes
creeping
but
neither
spoke
they
rode
the
horses
rushed
scattering
the
great
clods
skywards
with
such
thrills
as
colts
in
april
feel
there
in
the
daffodils
v
the
river
brimming
full
was
silvered
over
by
moonlight
at
the
ford
the
river
bank
smelt
of
bruised
clote
buds
and
of
yellow
clover
nosing
the
gleaming
dark
the
horses
drank
drooping
and
dripping
as
the
reins
fell
lank
the
men
drooped
too
the
stars
in
heaven
drooped
rank
after
hurrying
rank
the
silver
water
trooped
in
ceaseless
bright
procession
past
the
shallows
talking
its
quick
inconsequence
the
friends
warmed
by
the
gallop
on
the
unfenced
fallows
felt
it
a
kindlier
thing
to
make
amends
a
jolly
burst
said
michael
here
it
ends
your
way
lies
straight
beyond
the
water
there
watch
for
the
lights
and
keep
those
two
stars
as
they
bear
something
august
was
quick
in
all
that
sky
wheeling
in
multitudinous
march
with
fire
the
falling
of
the
wind
brought
it
more
nigh
they
felt
the
earth
take
solace
and
respire
the
horses
shifted
foothold
in
the
mire
splashing
and
making
eddies
lion
spoke
do
you
remember
riding
past
the
haunted
oak
that
christmas
eve
when
all
the
bells
were
ringing
so
that
we
picked
out
seven
bells
ringing
the
night
and
people
it
hummed
and
died
away
and
rose
in
swells
like
a
sea
breaking
we
have
been
through
hells
since
then
we
two
and
now
this
being
here
brings
all
that
christmas
back
and
makes
it
strangely
near
yes
michael
answered
they
were
happy
times
riding
beyond
there
but
a
man
needs
change
i
know
what
they
connote
those
christmas
chimes
fudge
in
the
heart
and
pudding
in
the
grange
it
stifles
me
all
that
i
need
the
range
like
this
before
us
open
to
the
sky
there
every
wing
is
clipped
but
here
a
man
can
fly
ah
said
his
friend
man
only
flies
in
youth
a
few
short
years
at
most
until
he
finds
that
even
quiet
is
a
form
of
truth
and
all
the
rest
a
coloured
rag
that
blinds
life
offers
nothing
but
contented
minds
some
day
know
it
michael
i
am
grieved
that
heart
will
pay
until
i
am
believed
there
was
a
silence
while
the
water
dripped
from
the
raised
muzzles
champing
on
the
steel
flogging
the
crannied
banks
the
water
lipped
night
up
above
them
turned
her
starry
wheel
and
each
man
feared
to
let
the
other
feel
how
much
he
felt
they
fenced
they
put
up
bars
the
moon
made
heaven
pale
among
the
withering
stars
michael
said
lion
why
should
we
two
part
ride
on
with
me
or
shall
we
both
return
make
preparation
and
start
and
travel
home
together
you
would
learn
how
much
the
people
long
to
see
you
turn
we
will
ride
back
and
say
and
then
sail
and
see
home
again
and
see
the
shropshire
men
and
see
the
old
shropshire
mountain
and
the
fair
full
of
drunk
welshmen
bringing
mountain
ewes
and
partridge
shooting
would
be
starting
there
michael
hung
down
his
head
and
seemed
to
choose
the
horses
churned
fresh
footing
in
the
ooze
then
michael
asked
if
tom
were
still
alive
old
tom
who
fought
the
welshman
under
upton
drive
for
nineteen
rounds
on
grass
with
the
bare
hands
shaky
said
lion
living
still
but
weak
almost
past
speaking
but
he
understands
and
old
shon
shones
we
teased
so
with
the
leek
dead
when
december
michael
did
not
speak
but
muttered
old
jones
dead
a
minute
passed
what
came
to
little
sue
his
girl
he
said
at
last
got
into
trouble
with
a
man
and
died
her
sister
keeps
the
child
his
hearer
stirred
dead
too
she
was
a
pretty
girl
he
sighed
a
graceful
pretty
creature
like
a
bird
what
is
the
child
a
boy
her
sister
heard
too
late
to
help
poor
susan
died
the
man
none
knew
who
he
could
be
but
many
rumours
ran
ah
michael
said
the
horses
tossed
their
heads
a
little
wind
arising
struck
in
chill
time
he
began
that
we
were
in
our
beds
a
distant
heifer
challenged
from
the
hill
scraped
at
the
earth
with
forefoot
and
was
still
come
with
me
lion
pleaded
michael
grinned
he
turned
his
splashing
horse
and
prophesied
a
wind
so
long
he
said
and
kind
of
you
to
call
straight
on
and
watch
the
stars
his
feet
trampled
the
firmer
foothold
ending
all
he
flung
behind
no
message
to
his
sweet
no
other
word
to
lion
the
dull
beat
of
his
trample
drummed
upon
the
trail
lion
could
watch
him
drooping
in
the
moonlight
pale
drooping
and
lessening
half
expectant
still
that
he
would
turn
and
greet
him
but
no
sound
came
save
the
lonely
and
the
going
horse
hoofs
dying
on
the
ground
michael
he
cried
michael
a
lonely
mound
beyond
the
water
gave
him
back
the
cry
at
an
end
he
said
and
i
have
failed
her
i
soon
the
far
died
save
for
a
stir
half
heard
then
lost
then
still
then
heard
again
a
quickening
rhythm
showed
he
plied
the
spur
then
a
vast
breathing
silence
took
the
plain
the
moon
was
like
a
soul
within
the
brain
of
the
great
sleeping
world
silent
she
rode
the
water
talked
talked
talked
it
trembled
as
it
flowed
a
moment
lion
thought
to
ride
in
chase
he
turned
then
turned
again
knowing
his
friend
he
forded
through
with
death
upon
his
face
and
rode
the
plain
that
seemed
never
to
end
clumps
of
pale
cattle
nosed
the
thing
unkenned
riding
the
night
out
of
the
night
they
rose
snuffing
with
outstretched
heads
stamping
with
surly
lows
till
he
was
threading
through
a
crowd
a
sea
of
curious
shorthorns
backing
as
he
came
barring
his
path
but
shifting
warily
he
slapped
the
hairy
flanks
of
the
more
tame
unreal
the
ghostly
cattle
lumbered
lame
his
horse
kept
at
an
even
pace
the
cows
broke
right
and
left
like
waves
before
advancing
bows
lonely
the
pampas
seemed
amid
that
herd
the
thought
of
sorrow
pricked
him
sore
he
brought
no
comfort
for
her
not
a
word
he
would
not
ease
her
pain
but
bring
her
more
the
long
miles
dropped
behind
lights
rose
before
lights
and
the
seaport
and
the
briny
air
and
so
he
sailed
for
home
to
comfort
mary
there
when
mary
knew
the
worst
she
only
sighed
looked
hard
at
face
and
sat
quite
still
white
to
the
lips
but
stern
and
beaten
by
life
in
all
things
but
the
will
though
the
blow
struck
her
hard
it
did
not
kill
she
rallied
on
herself
a
new
life
bloomed
out
of
the
ashy
heart
where
michael
lay
entombed
and
more
than
this
for
lion
touched
a
sense
that
he
the
honest
humdrum
man
was
more
than
he
by
whom
the
glory
and
the
offence
came
to
her
life
three
bitter
years
before
this
was
a
treason
in
her
core
it
smouldered
there
meanwhile
as
two
good
friends
they
met
at
autumn
dusks
and
winter
and
once
after
long
twilight
talk
he
broke
his
strong
restraint
upon
his
passion
for
her
and
burningly
most
like
a
man
he
spoke
until
her
pity
almost
overbore
her
it
could
not
be
she
said
her
pity
tore
her
but
still
it
could
not
be
though
this
was
pain
then
on
a
frosty
night
they
met
and
spoke
again
and
then
he
wooed
again
clutching
her
hands
calling
the
maid
his
mind
his
heart
his
soul
saying
that
god
had
linked
their
lives
in
bands
when
the
worm
life
first
started
from
the
goal
that
they
were
linked
together
past
control
linked
from
all
time
could
she
but
pity
she
pitied
him
from
the
soul
but
said
it
could
not
be
mary
he
asked
you
can
not
love
me
no
no
she
replied
would
god
i
could
my
dear
god
bless
you
then
he
answered
i
must
go
go
over
sea
to
get
away
from
here
i
can
not
think
of
work
when
you
are
near
my
whole
life
falls
to
pieces
it
must
end
this
meeting
now
must
be
beloved
friend
she
listened
then
with
failing
breath
she
asked
for
yet
a
little
time
her
face
was
even
as
that
of
one
condemned
to
death
she
asked
for
yet
another
three
grace
asked
it
as
lion
inly
knew
in
case
michael
should
still
return
and
yes
said
he
wait
three
months
for
you
beloved
let
it
be
slowly
the
three
months
dragged
no
michael
came
march
brought
the
daffodils
and
set
them
shaking
april
was
quick
in
nature
like
green
flame
may
came
with
buds
and
corncrakes
craking
then
dwindled
like
her
blossom
june
was
breaking
mary
said
lion
can
you
answer
now
white
like
a
ghost
she
stood
he
long
remembered
how
and
white
and
trembling
like
a
leaf
she
gave
her
answer
yes
she
gave
her
lips
cold
as
a
to
the
kiss
of
grief
shuddering
at
him
as
if
his
touch
were
whips
then
her
best
nature
struggling
to
eclipse
this
shrinking
self
made
speech
she
jested
there
they
searched
each
eyes
and
both
souls
saw
despair
so
the
first
passed
and
after
that
began
a
happier
time
she
could
not
choose
but
praise
that
recognition
of
her
in
the
man
striving
to
salve
her
pride
in
myriad
ways
he
was
a
gentle
lover
gentle
days
passed
like
a
music
after
tragic
scenes
her
heart
gave
thanks
for
that
but
still
the
haunted
her
inner
spirit
day
and
night
and
often
in
his
kiss
the
memory
came
of
face
above
her
passionate
white
his
lips
at
her
lips
murmuring
her
name
then
she
would
suffer
sleepless
sick
with
shame
and
struggle
with
her
weakness
she
had
vowed
to
give
herself
to
lion
she
was
true
and
proud
he
should
not
have
a
woman
sick
with
ghosts
but
one
to
be
his
so
time
passed
one
by
one
the
marking
posts
the
and
the
foxglove
and
the
lime
then
on
a
day
the
rang
a
chime
men
fired
the
bells
till
all
the
valley
filled
with
from
the
belfry
where
the
jackdaws
build
lion
and
she
were
married
home
they
went
home
to
the
roughs
as
man
and
wife
the
news
was
printed
in
the
paper
mary
sent
a
copy
out
to
michael
now
we
lose
sight
of
her
for
a
time
and
the
great
dews
fall
and
the
grows
red
and
fills
over
the
barren
fields
where
march
brings
daffodils
vi
the
rider
lingered
at
the
fence
a
moment
tossed
out
the
pack
to
michael
whistling
low
then
rode
waving
his
hand
without
more
comment
down
the
vast
pampas
sloping
slow
last
news
had
come
so
long
ago
he
wondered
who
had
written
now
the
hand
thrilled
him
with
vague
alarm
it
brought
him
to
a
stand
he
opened
it
with
one
eye
on
the
hut
lest
she
within
were
watching
him
but
she
was
combing
out
her
hair
the
door
was
shut
the
green
closed
she
could
not
see
out
fell
the
handkerchief
which
he
had
had
embroidered
with
his
name
for
her
it
had
been
dearly
kept
it
smelt
of
lavender
something
remained
a
paper
crossed
with
blue
where
he
should
read
he
stood
there
in
the
sun
reading
of
wedding
till
he
knew
what
he
had
cast
away
what
he
had
done
he
was
rejected
lion
was
the
one
lion
the
godly
and
the
upright
he
the
black
lines
in
the
paper
showed
how
it
could
be
he
pocketed
the
love
gift
and
took
horse
and
rode
out
to
the
for
his
savings
then
turned
and
rode
a
lonely
alone
with
bitter
thoughts
and
bitter
cravings
on
the
reeds
made
twinkling
wavings
an
turtle
scooped
the
mud
mary
had
married
lion
and
the
news
drew
blood
and
with
the
bitterness
the
outcast
felt
a
passion
for
those
old
kind
shropshire
places
the
ruined
chancel
where
the
nuns
had
knelt
high
ercall
and
the
chase
end
and
the
chases
the
glimmering
mere
the
burr
the
faces
by
wrekin
and
by
zine
and
country
town
the
turtle
burrowed
further
down
he
could
remember
mary
now
her
crying
night
after
night
alone
through
weary
years
had
touched
him
now
and
set
the
cords
replying
he
knew
her
misery
now
her
ache
her
tears
the
lonely
nights
the
ceaseless
hope
the
fears
the
arm
stretched
out
for
one
not
there
the
slow
loss
of
the
faith
the
letting
comfort
go
now
i
will
ride
he
said
beyond
the
ford
he
caught
a
fresh
horse
and
rode
on
the
night
found
him
a
guest
at
pepe
board
moody
and
drinking
rum
and
ripe
for
fight
drawing
his
gun
he
shot
away
the
light
and
parried
knife
and
caught
his
horse
and
all
night
long
he
rode
bedevilled
by
remorse
at
dawn
he
caught
an
ferry
and
all
day
long
he
steamed
between
great
banks
which
smelt
of
yellow
thorn
and
loganberry
then
wharves
appeared
and
chimneys
rose
in
ranks
mast
upon
mast
arose
the
flanks
were
filled
with
english
ships
and
one
he
found
needing
another
stoker
being
homeward
bound
and
all
the
time
the
trouble
in
his
head
ran
like
a
whirlwind
moving
him
he
knew
since
she
was
lost
that
he
was
better
dead
he
had
no
project
outlined
what
to
do
beyond
go
home
he
joined
the
crew
she
sailed
that
night
he
dulled
his
maddened
soul
plying
the
iron
on
the
bunker
coal
work
did
not
clear
the
turmoil
in
his
mind
passion
takes
colour
from
the
core
his
misery
was
as
his
nature
blind
life
was
still
turmoil
when
he
went
ashore
to
see
his
old
love
married
lay
before
to
see
another
have
her
drink
the
gall
kicked
like
a
dog
without
while
he
within
had
all
soon
he
was
at
the
foxholes
at
the
place
whither
from
over
sea
his
heart
had
turned
often
at
in
times
of
grace
but
little
outward
change
his
eye
discerned
a
red
rose
at
her
bedroom
window
burned
just
as
before
even
as
of
old
the
wasps
poised
at
the
yellow
plums
the
gate
creaked
on
its
hasps
and
the
white
fantails
sidled
on
the
roof
just
as
before
their
pink
feet
even
as
of
old
printed
the
frosty
rime
with
proof
still
the
thatch
was
green
with
mould
the
apples
on
the
withered
boughs
were
gold
men
and
the
times
were
changed
and
i
said
he
will
go
and
not
return
since
she
is
not
for
me
go
for
it
would
be
a
scurvy
thing
to
spoil
her
marriage
and
besides
she
cares
for
that
she
married
with
the
ring
small
joy
for
me
in
seeing
how
she
wears
or
seeing
what
he
takes
and
what
she
shares
that
beauty
and
those
ways
she
had
such
ways
there
in
the
daffodils
in
those
old
april
days
so
with
an
impulse
of
good
will
he
turned
leaving
that
place
of
daffodils
the
road
was
paven
sharp
with
memories
which
burned
he
trod
them
strongly
under
as
he
strode
at
the
green
forge
the
furnace
glowed
red
dithying
sparks
flew
from
the
crumpled
soft
fold
from
the
heart
down
clanged
the
hammers
oft
that
was
a
bitter
place
to
pass
for
there
mary
and
he
had
often
often
stayed
to
watch
the
horseshoe
growing
in
the
glare
it
was
a
tryst
in
childhood
when
they
strayed
there
was
a
stile
beside
the
forge
he
laid
his
elbows
on
it
leaning
looking
down
the
stretched
with
great
trees
turning
brown
infinite
too
because
it
reached
the
sky
and
distant
spires
arose
and
distant
smoke
the
whiteness
on
the
blue
went
stilly
by
only
the
clinking
forge
the
stillness
broke
ryemeadows
brook
was
there
the
roughs
the
oak
where
the
white
woman
walked
the
black
firs
showed
around
the
occleve
homestead
new
abode
a
long
long
time
he
gazed
at
that
fair
place
so
well
remembered
from
of
old
he
sighed
i
will
go
down
and
look
upon
her
face
see
her
again
whatever
may
betide
hell
is
my
future
i
shall
soon
have
died
but
i
will
take
to
hell
one
memory
more
she
shall
not
see
nor
know
i
shall
be
gone
before
before
they
turn
the
dogs
upon
me
even
i
do
not
mean
to
speak
but
only
see
even
the
devil
gets
a
peep
at
heaven
one
peep
at
her
shall
come
to
hell
with
me
one
peep
at
her
no
matter
what
may
be
he
crossed
the
stile
and
hurried
down
the
slope
remembered
trees
and
hedges
gave
a
zest
to
hope
a
low
brick
wall
with
privet
shrubs
beyond
ringed
in
the
roughs
upon
the
side
he
neared
eastward
some
bramble
bushes
cloaked
the
pond
westward
was
not
yet
cleared
he
thrust
aside
the
privet
boughs
and
peered
the
drooping
fir
trees
let
their
darkness
trail
black
like
a
masts
bound
under
easy
sail
the
garden
with
its
autumn
flowers
was
there
few
that
his
wayward
memory
linked
with
her
summer
had
burnt
the
summer
flowers
bare
but
bees
still
made
a
stir
sprigs
were
still
bluish
on
the
lavender
and
bluish
daisies
budded
bright
flies
poised
the
wren
upon
the
carolled
he
could
not
see
her
there
windows
were
wide
late
wasps
were
cruising
and
the
curtains
shook
smoke
like
the
breathing
floated
sighed
among
the
trembling
firs
strange
ways
it
took
but
still
no
presence
blessed
his
look
the
house
was
still
as
if
deserted
hushed
faint
fragrance
hung
about
it
as
if
herbs
were
crushed
fragrance
that
gave
his
guard
a
hint
of
times
long
past
of
reapers
in
the
corn
bruising
with
heavy
boots
the
stalks
of
mint
when
first
the
berry
reddens
on
the
thorn
memories
of
her
that
fragrance
brought
forlorn
that
vigil
of
the
watching
outcast
grew
he
crept
towards
the
kitchen
sheltered
by
a
yew
the
windows
of
the
kitchen
opened
wide
again
the
fragrance
came
a
woman
spoke
old
occleve
talked
to
one
inside
a
smell
of
cooking
filled
a
gust
of
smoke
then
fragrance
once
again
for
herbs
were
broke
pourri
was
being
made
the
listener
heard
things
lifted
and
laid
down
bruised
into
sweetness
stirred
while
an
old
woman
made
remarks
to
one
who
was
not
the
beloved
michael
learned
that
wife
at
upton
had
a
son
and
that
the
red
geraniums
should
be
turned
a
hen
was
missing
and
a
rick
was
burned
our
lord
commanded
patience
here
it
broke
the
window
closed
it
made
the
kitchen
chimney
smoke
steps
clacked
on
flagstones
to
the
outer
door
a
whom
he
remembered
well
lined
now
with
age
and
grayer
than
before
rang
a
cracked
for
the
he
saw
the
he
could
not
tell
if
mary
were
within
inly
he
knew
that
she
was
coming
now
that
she
would
be
in
blue
blue
with
a
silver
locket
at
the
throat
and
that
she
would
be
there
within
there
near
with
the
little
blushes
that
he
knew
by
rote
and
the
grey
eyes
so
steadfast
and
so
dear
the
voice
pure
like
the
nature
true
and
clear
speaking
to
her
within
the
room
the
gate
clicked
lion
came
the
outcast
hugged
the
gloom
watching
intently
from
below
the
boughs
while
lion
cleared
his
of
clay
eyed
the
high
clouds
and
went
within
the
house
his
eyes
looked
troubled
and
his
hair
looked
gray
dinner
began
within
with
much
to
say
old
occleve
roared
aloud
at
his
own
joke
mary
it
seemed
was
gone
the
loved
voice
never
spoke
nor
could
her
lover
see
her
from
the
yew
she
was
not
there
at
table
she
was
ill
ill
or
away
perhaps
he
wished
he
knew
away
perhaps
for
occleve
bellowed
still
if
sick
he
thought
the
maid
or
lion
will
take
food
to
her
he
watched
the
dinner
ended
the
staircase
was
not
used
none
climbed
it
none
descended
not
here
he
thought
but
wishing
to
be
sure
he
waited
till
the
occleves
went
to
field
then
followed
round
the
house
another
lure
using
the
privet
as
his
shield
he
meant
to
run
a
risk
his
heart
was
steeled
he
knew
of
old
which
bedroom
would
be
hers
he
crouched
upon
the
north
front
in
among
the
firs
the
house
stared
at
him
with
its
blank
its
vacant
its
open
door
with
old
wrought
bridle
at
each
flank
swayed
on
a
creaking
hinge
as
the
wind
bore
nothing
had
changed
the
house
was
as
before
the
dull
red
brick
the
windows
sealed
or
wide
i
will
go
in
he
said
he
rose
and
stepped
inside
none
could
have
seen
him
coming
all
was
still
he
listened
in
the
doorway
for
a
sign
above
a
rafter
creaked
a
stir
a
thrill
moved
till
the
frames
clacked
on
the
picture
line
old
mother
occleve
sleeps
the
servants
dine
he
muttered
listening
hush
a
silence
brooded
far
off
the
kitchen
dinner
clattered
he
intruded
still
to
his
right
the
best
room
door
was
locked
another
door
was
at
his
left
he
stayed
within
a
stately
timepiece
ticked
and
tocked
to
one
who
slumbered
breathing
deep
it
made
an
image
of
going
and
trade
he
looked
old
mother
occleve
lay
asleep
hands
crossed
upon
her
knitting
rosy
breathing
deep
he
tiptoed
up
the
stairs
which
creaked
and
cracked
the
landing
creaked
the
shut
doors
painted
gray
loomed
as
if
shutting
in
some
dreadful
act
the
nodding
frames
seemed
ready
to
betray
the
east
room
had
been
closed
in
day
being
the
best
but
now
he
guessed
it
hers
the
fields
of
daffodils
lay
next
it
past
the
firs
just
as
he
reached
the
landing
lion
cried
somewhere
below
get
it
feet
struck
on
the
flagstones
with
a
hasty
stride
coming
up
thought
michael
we
shall
meet
he
snatched
the
nearest
door
for
his
retreat
opened
with
swift
silence
dared
not
close
but
stood
within
behind
it
footsteps
rose
running
two
steps
at
once
while
michael
stood
not
breathing
only
knowing
that
the
room
was
bedroom
smelling
of
old
wood
hung
with
engravings
of
the
day
of
doom
the
footsteps
stopped
and
lion
called
to
whom
a
gentle
question
tapping
at
a
door
and
michael
shifted
feet
and
creakings
took
the
floor
the
footsteps
recommenced
a
clacked
within
an
eastern
room
the
footsteps
passed
drawers
were
pulled
loudly
open
and
ransacked
chattels
were
thrust
aside
and
overcast
what
could
the
thing
be
that
he
sought
at
last
his
voice
said
here
it
is
the
wormed
floor
creaked
with
returning
footsteps
down
the
corridor
the
footsteps
came
as
though
the
walker
read
or
added
rows
of
figures
by
the
way
there
was
much
hesitation
in
the
tread
lion
seemed
pondering
which
to
go
or
stay
then
seeing
the
door
which
covered
michael
sway
he
swiftly
crossed
and
shut
it
always
one
for
order
michael
muttered
now
be
swift
my
son
the
action
seemed
to
break
the
mood
the
footsteps
passed
downstairs
along
the
hall
out
at
the
door
and
off
towards
the
wood
gone
michael
muttered
now
to
hazard
all
outside
the
frames
still
nodded
on
the
wall
michael
stepped
swiftly
up
the
floor
to
try
the
door
where
lion
tapped
and
waited
for
reply
it
was
the
eastmost
of
the
rooms
which
look
over
the
fields
of
daffodils
the
bound
scanned
from
its
windows
is
ryemeadows
brook
banked
by
gnarled
apple
trees
and
rising
ground
most
gently
michael
tapped
he
heard
no
sound
only
the
tapping
with
the
wind
the
was
opened
dinned
a
woman
walked
along
the
hall
below
humming
a
maid
he
judged
the
footsteps
died
listening
intently
still
he
heard
them
go
then
swiftly
turned
the
knob
and
went
inside
the
at
the
window
volleyed
wide
the
curtains
streamed
out
like
a
waterfall
the
pictures
of
the
clacked
along
the
wall
no
one
was
there
no
one
the
room
was
hers
a
book
of
praise
lay
open
on
the
bed
the
smelt
of
many
lavenders
her
spirit
stamped
the
room
herself
was
fled
here
she
found
peace
of
soul
like
daily
bread
here
with
her
lover
lion
michael
gazed
he
would
have
been
the
sharer
had
he
not
been
crazed
he
took
the
handkerchief
again
he
laid
it
on
her
table
near
the
glass
so
opened
that
the
broidered
name
was
plain
plain
he
exclaimed
she
can
not
let
it
pass
it
stands
and
speaks
for
me
as
bold
as
brass
my
answer
my
cry
to
tell
her
this
that
she
is
still
my
darling
all
she
was
she
is
so
she
will
know
at
least
that
she
was
wrong
that
underneath
the
blindness
i
was
true
fate
is
the
strongest
thing
though
men
are
strong
out
from
beyond
life
i
was
sealed
to
you
but
my
blind
ways
destroyed
the
cords
that
drew
and
now
the
evil
done
i
know
my
need
fate
has
his
way
with
those
who
mar
what
is
decreed
and
now
goodbye
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
then
stept
with
firm
swift
footstep
down
the
stair
meaning
to
go
where
she
would
never
find
him
he
would
go
down
through
darkness
to
despair
out
at
the
door
he
stept
the
autumn
air
came
fresh
upon
his
face
none
saw
him
go
goodbye
my
love
he
muttered
it
is
better
so
soon
he
was
on
the
high
road
out
of
sight
of
valley
and
farm
soon
he
could
see
no
more
the
pointing
finger
take
the
light
as
tumbling
pigeons
glittered
over
nor
could
he
behold
the
gilded
swinging
above
the
church
the
road
swung
round
now
the
last
look
he
cried
he
saw
that
holy
ground
goodbye
he
cried
he
could
behold
it
all
spread
out
as
in
a
picture
but
so
clear
that
the
gold
apple
stood
out
from
the
wall
like
a
red
jewel
stood
the
grazing
steer
precise
intensely
coloured
all
brought
near
as
in
a
vision
lay
that
holy
ground
mary
is
there
he
moaned
and
i
am
outward
bound
i
never
saw
this
place
so
beautiful
never
like
this
i
never
saw
it
glow
spirit
is
on
this
place
it
fills
it
full
so
let
the
die
be
cast
i
will
not
go
but
i
will
see
her
face
to
face
and
know
from
her
own
lips
what
thoughts
she
has
of
me
and
if
disaster
come
right
let
disaster
be
back
by
another
way
he
turned
the
sun
fired
the
in
the
roman
woods
lights
in
the
valley
twinkled
one
by
one
the
starlings
whirled
in
dropping
multitudes
dusk
fingered
into
one
many
moods
back
to
the
roughs
he
walked
he
neared
the
brook
a
lamp
burned
in
the
farm
he
saw
his
fingers
shook
he
had
to
cross
the
brook
to
cross
a
field
where
daffodils
were
thick
when
years
were
young
then
were
she
there
his
fortunes
should
be
sealed
down
the
mud
trackway
to
the
brook
he
swung
then
while
the
passion
trembled
on
his
tongue
dim
by
the
dim
he
seemed
to
see
a
figure
standing
mute
a
woman
it
was
she
she
stood
quite
stilly
waiting
for
him
there
she
did
not
seem
surprised
the
meeting
seemed
planned
from
all
time
by
powers
in
the
air
to
change
their
human
fates
he
even
deemed
that
in
another
life
this
thing
had
gleamed
this
meeting
by
the
bridge
he
said
you
yes
i
she
said
who
else
you
must
have
known
you
knew
that
i
should
come
here
to
the
brook
to
see
after
your
message
you
were
out
he
said
gone
and
i
did
not
know
where
you
could
be
where
were
you
mary
when
the
thing
was
laid
old
gale
is
dying
and
i
stayed
longer
than
usual
while
i
read
the
word
you
could
have
hardly
gone
she
paused
her
bosom
stirred
mary
i
sinned
he
said
not
that
dear
no
she
said
but
oh
you
were
unkind
unkind
never
to
write
a
word
and
leave
me
so
but
out
of
sight
with
you
is
out
of
mind
mary
i
sinned
he
said
and
i
was
blind
oh
my
beloved
are
you
wife
sounds
strange
she
answered
in
my
present
life
but
it
is
sweet
to
hear
it
all
the
same
it
is
a
language
little
heard
by
me
alone
in
that
keeping
with
my
shame
i
never
thought
such
miseries
could
be
i
was
so
happy
in
you
michael
he
came
when
i
felt
you
changed
from
what
i
thought
you
even
now
it
is
not
love
but
jealousy
that
brought
you
that
is
untrue
he
said
i
am
in
hell
you
are
my
beloved
mary
you
by
god
i
know
your
beauty
now
too
well
we
are
each
flesh
and
soul
we
two
that
was
sweet
knowledge
once
she
said
we
knew
that
truth
of
old
now
in
a
strange
bed
i
read
it
in
my
soul
and
find
it
written
red
is
he
a
brute
he
asked
no
she
replied
i
did
not
understand
what
it
would
mean
and
now
that
you
are
back
would
i
had
died
died
and
the
misery
of
it
not
have
been
lion
would
not
be
wrecked
nor
i
unclean
i
was
a
proud
one
once
and
now
tame
oh
michael
say
some
word
to
take
away
my
shame
she
sobbed
his
arms
went
round
her
the
night
heard
intense
fierce
whispering
passing
soul
to
soul
love
running
hot
on
many
a
murmured
word
passionate
giving
into
new
control
their
present
misery
did
but
blow
the
coal
did
but
entangle
deeper
their
two
wills
while
the
brown
brook
ran
on
by
buried
daffodils
vii
upon
a
light
gust
came
a
waft
of
bells
ringing
the
chimes
for
nine
a
broken
sweet
like
waters
bubbling
out
of
hidden
wells
dully
upon
those
ears
it
beat
their
time
was
at
an
end
her
tottering
feet
trod
the
dim
field
for
home
he
sought
an
inn
oh
i
have
sinned
she
cried
but
not
a
secret
sin
inside
the
roughs
they
waited
for
her
coming
eyeing
the
ticking
clock
the
household
sat
nine
the
clock
struck
the
ran
down
drumming
old
mother
occleve
stretched
her
sewing
flat
nine
she
said
old
occleve
stroked
the
cat
ah
cat
he
said
hast
had
good
go
at
mouse
lion
sat
listening
tense
to
all
within
the
house
mary
is
late
the
gammer
said
the
times
have
changed
her
merry
husband
roared
young
married
couples
now
like
lonely
trade
think
of
bed
at
all
they
think
of
board
no
multiplying
left
in
people
lord
when
i
was
age
had
my
five
there
was
some
go
in
folk
when
us
two
took
to
wive
lion
arose
and
stalked
and
bit
his
lip
or
was
it
six
the
old
man
muttered
six
us
had
so
many
alost
the
tip
us
were
two
right
good
souls
at
getting
chicks
two
births
of
twins
then
birth
then
now
give
a
young
man
time
the
mother
cried
mary
came
swiftly
in
and
flung
the
room
door
wide
lion
was
by
the
window
when
she
came
old
occleve
and
his
wife
were
by
the
fire
big
shadows
leapt
the
ceiling
from
the
flame
she
fronted
the
three
figures
and
came
nigher
lion
she
whispered
i
return
my
hire
she
dropped
her
upon
the
table
then
in
a
louder
voice
i
bore
what
i
was
able
and
time
and
marriage
might
have
worn
me
down
perhaps
to
be
a
good
wife
and
a
blest
with
little
children
clinging
to
my
gown
and
little
blind
mouths
fumbling
for
my
breast
and
this
place
would
have
been
a
place
of
rest
for
you
and
me
we
could
have
come
to
know
the
depth
but
that
is
over
i
have
got
to
go
he
has
come
back
and
i
have
got
to
go
our
marriage
ends
she
stood
there
white
and
breathed
old
occleve
got
upon
his
feet
with
so
blazing
with
wrath
upon
the
hearth
he
seethed
a
log
fell
from
the
bars
blue
spirals
wreathed
across
the
still
old
startled
face
the
cat
arose
and
yawned
lion
was
still
a
space
old
occleve
turned
to
lion
lion
moved
nearer
to
mary
picking
up
the
ring
his
was
grim
physic
from
the
soul
beloved
his
face
was
white
and
twitching
with
the
sting
you
are
my
wife
you
can
not
do
this
thing
he
said
at
last
i
can
respect
your
pride
this
thing
affects
your
soul
my
judgment
must
decide
you
are
unsettled
shaken
from
the
shock
not
so
she
said
she
stretched
a
hand
to
him
white
large
and
noble
steady
as
a
rock
cunning
with
many
powers
curving
slim
the
smoke
drawn
by
the
made
it
dim
right
lion
answered
you
are
steady
then
there
is
but
one
world
mary
this
the
world
of
men
and
another
world
without
its
bounds
peopled
by
streaked
and
spotted
souls
who
prize
the
flashiness
that
comes
from
marshy
grounds
above
plain
daylight
in
their
blinkered
eyes
nothing
is
bright
but
sentimental
lies
such
as
are
offered
you
dear
here
and
now
lies
which
betray
the
strongest
god
alone
knows
how
you
in
your
beauty
and
your
whiteness
turn
your
strong
white
mind
your
faith
your
fearless
truth
all
for
these
rotten
fires
that
so
burn
a
sentimental
clutch
at
perished
youth
i
am
too
sick
for
wisdom
sick
with
ruth
and
this
comes
suddenly
the
unripe
man
misses
the
hour
oh
god
but
you
what
is
your
plan
what
do
you
mean
to
do
how
act
how
live
what
warrant
have
you
for
your
life
what
trust
you
are
for
going
sailing
in
a
sieve
this
brightness
is
too
mortal
not
to
rust
so
our
beginning
marriage
ends
in
dust
i
have
not
failed
you
mary
let
me
know
what
you
intend
to
do
and
whither
you
will
go
go
from
this
place
it
chokes
me
she
replied
this
place
has
branded
me
i
must
regain
my
truth
that
i
have
soiled
my
faith
my
pride
it
is
all
poison
and
it
leaves
a
stain
i
can
not
stay
nor
be
your
wife
again
never
you
did
your
best
though
you
were
kind
i
have
grown
old
and
left
all
that
behind
goodbye
she
turned
old
occleve
faced
his
son
wrath
at
the
impudence
was
blent
upon
his
face
with
wrath
that
such
an
one
should
stand
unthrashed
until
her
words
were
spent
he
stayed
for
wrath
but
mary
went
unchecked
he
did
not
stir
her
footsteps
ground
the
gravel
to
the
gate
the
made
a
sound
like
to
a
cry
of
pain
after
a
shot
swinging
it
clicked
it
clicked
again
it
swung
until
the
iron
latch
bar
hit
the
slot
mary
had
gone
and
lion
held
his
tongue
old
mother
occleve
sobbed
her
white
head
hung
over
her
sewing
while
the
tears
ran
down
her
worn
cheeks
and
splashed
upon
her
gown
yes
it
is
true
said
lion
she
must
go
michael
is
back
michael
was
always
first
i
did
but
take
his
place
you
did
not
know
now
it
has
happened
and
you
know
the
worst
so
passion
makes
the
passionate
soul
accurst
and
crucifies
his
darling
michael
comes
and
the
savage
truth
appears
and
rips
my
life
to
thrums
upon
old
face
the
fury
changed
first
to
contempt
and
then
to
terror
lest
lion
beneath
the
shock
should
be
deranged
but
eyes
were
steady
though
distressed
father
he
said
going
to
rest
i
can
not
talk
mother
he
kissed
her
brow
and
went
they
heard
him
strike
a
light
and
go
with
slow
depressed
step
up
the
stairs
up
to
the
door
of
her
deserted
bower
they
heard
him
up
above
them
moving
chairs
the
memory
of
his
paleness
made
them
cower
they
did
not
know
their
son
they
had
no
power
to
help
they
only
saw
the
bride
defy
their
child
and
faith
and
custom
put
aside
after
a
time
men
learned
where
mary
was
over
the
hills
not
many
miles
away
renting
a
cottage
and
a
patch
of
grass
where
michael
came
to
see
her
every
day
taught
her
what
fevers
can
inhabit
clay
shaking
this
body
that
so
soon
must
die
the
time
made
lion
old
the
winter
dwindled
by
till
the
long
misery
had
to
end
or
kill
and
i
must
go
to
see
her
lion
cried
i
am
her
standby
and
she
needs
me
still
if
not
to
love
she
needs
me
to
decide
dear
i
will
set
you
free
oh
my
bright
bride
lost
in
such
piteous
ways
come
back
he
rode
over
the
wintry
hills
to
new
abode
and
as
he
topped
the
pass
between
the
hills
towards
him
up
the
swerving
road
there
came
michael
the
happy
cause
of
all
his
ills
walking
as
though
repentance
were
the
shame
sucking
a
grass
unbuttoned
still
the
same
humming
a
tune
his
careless
beauty
wild
drawing
the
eyes
he
wandered
with
a
child
who
heard
the
scraps
of
tales
which
fell
between
the
fragments
of
the
tune
they
seemed
a
cherub
bringing
up
a
soul
from
hell
meeting
unlike
the
meeting
long
since
dreamed
lion
dismounted
the
great
valley
gleamed
with
waters
far
below
his
teeth
were
set
his
heart
thumped
at
his
throat
he
stopped
the
two
men
met
the
child
well
knew
that
fatal
issues
joined
he
stood
to
watch
them
even
as
fate
stood
with
his
pennypiece
of
causes
coined
ready
to
throw
for
issue
the
bright
hate
throbbed
that
the
heavy
reckoning
need
not
wait
lion
stepped
forward
watching
eyes
we
are
old
friends
he
said
now
michael
you
be
wise
and
let
the
harm
already
done
suffice
go
before
name
is
wholly
gone
spare
her
the
misery
of
desertion
twice
only
ruin
in
the
road
on
ruin
for
both
whatever
promise
shone
in
sentimental
shrinkings
from
the
fact
so
michael
play
the
man
and
do
the
generous
act
and
go
if
not
for
my
sake
go
for
hers
you
only
want
her
with
your
sentiment
you
are
water
roughed
by
every
wind
that
stirs
one
little
gust
will
alter
your
intent
all
ways
to
every
wind
and
nothing
meant
is
your
habit
man
one
takes
a
wife
not
for
a
three
fancy
but
the
whole
of
life
we
have
been
friends
and
so
i
speak
you
fair
how
will
you
bear
her
ill
or
cross
or
tired
sentiment
sighing
will
not
help
you
there
you
call
a
half
volume
not
desired
i
know
your
love
for
her
i
saw
it
mired
mired
past
going
by
your
first
sharp
taste
of
life
and
work
it
stopped
you
let
her
whole
life
waste
rather
than
have
the
trouble
of
such
love
you
will
again
but
if
you
do
it
now
it
will
mean
death
not
sorrow
but
enough
you
know
too
well
you
can
not
keep
a
vow
there
are
gray
hairs
already
on
her
brow
you
brought
them
there
death
is
the
next
step
go
before
you
take
the
step
no
michael
answered
no
as
for
my
past
i
was
a
dog
a
cur
and
i
have
paid
and
still
pay
but
all
my
being
is
ablaze
with
her
there
is
no
talk
of
giving
up
i
will
not
give
her
up
you
used
to
say
bodies
are
earth
i
heard
you
say
it
liar
you
never
loved
her
you
she
turns
the
earth
to
fire
michael
said
lion
you
have
said
such
things
of
other
women
less
than
six
miles
hence
you
and
another
woman
felt
wings
rosy
and
fair
and
so
took
leave
of
sense
dead
that
other
woman
dead
with
pence
pressed
on
her
big
brown
eyes
under
the
ground
she
that
was
merry
once
feeling
the
world
go
round
her
child
and
yours
is
with
her
sister
now
out
there
behind
us
living
as
they
can
pinched
by
the
poverty
that
you
allow
all
a
long
autumn
many
rumours
ran
about
sue
jones
that
was
you
were
the
man
the
lad
is
like
you
think
about
his
mother
before
you
turn
the
earth
to
fire
with
another
that
is
enough
said
michael
you
shall
know
soon
to
your
marrow
what
my
answer
is
know
to
your
lying
heart
now
kindly
go
the
neighbours
smell
that
something
is
amiss
we
two
will
keep
a
dignity
in
this
such
as
we
can
no
quarrelling
with
me
here
mary
might
see
now
go
but
recollect
my
dear
that
if
you
twit
me
with
your
wife
you
lie
and
that
your
further
insult
waits
a
day
when
god
permits
that
mary
is
not
by
i
keep
the
record
of
it
and
shall
pay
and
as
for
mary
listen
we
betray
no
one
we
keep
our
as
we
meant
now
go
the
neighbours
gather
lion
bowed
and
went
home
to
his
memories
for
a
month
of
pain
each
moment
like
a
devil
with
a
tongue
urging
him
set
her
free
or
try
again
or
kill
that
man
and
stamp
him
into
dung
see
her
he
cried
he
took
his
horse
and
swung
out
on
the
road
to
her
the
rain
was
falling
her
dropping
splashed
him
when
he
knocked
there
calling
drowned
yellow
jasmine
dripped
his
flanks
steamed
and
dark
runnels
on
his
yellow
hair
streaked
the
groomed
surface
into
blotchy
ranks
the
noise
of
water
dropping
filled
the
air
he
knocked
again
but
there
was
no
one
there
no
one
within
the
door
was
locked
no
smoke
came
from
the
chimney
stacks
no
clock
ticked
no
one
spoke
only
the
water
dripped
and
and
gurgled
through
the
to
the
butt
drops
trickling
down
the
windows
paused
or
slipped
a
wet
twig
scraked
as
though
the
glass
were
cut
the
blinds
were
all
drawn
down
the
windows
shut
no
one
was
there
across
the
road
a
shawl
showed
at
a
door
a
space
a
woman
gave
a
call
gone
away
she
cried
gone
away
been
gone
a
matter
of
a
week
where
to
the
woman
thought
to
wales
but
could
not
say
nor
if
she
planned
returning
no
one
knew
she
looked
at
lion
sharply
then
she
drew
the
to
its
place
and
passed
within
saying
she
hoped
the
rain
would
stop
and
spring
begin
lion
rode
home
a
month
went
by
and
now
winter
was
gone
the
myriad
shoots
of
green
bent
to
the
wind
like
hair
upon
the
plough
and
up
from
withered
leaves
came
celandine
and
sunlight
came
though
still
the
air
was
keen
so
that
the
first
march
market
was
most
fair
and
lion
rode
to
market
having
business
there
and
in
the
afternoon
when
all
was
done
while
lion
waited
idly
near
the
inn
watching
the
pigeons
sidling
in
the
sun
as
jim
the
ostler
put
his
gelding
in
he
heard
a
noise
of
rioting
begin
outside
the
yard
with
catcalls
there
were
shouts
of
occleve
lion
occleve
from
a
pack
of
louts
who
hung
about
the
and
cried
yah
occleve
of
the
roughs
the
married
man
occleve
who
had
the
bed
and
not
the
bride
at
first
without
the
arch
but
some
began
to
sidle
in
still
calling
children
ran
to
watch
the
baiting
they
were
leavings
who
shouted
thus
men
cast
for
drunkenness
and
thievings
lion
knew
most
of
them
of
old
he
paid
no
heed
to
them
but
turned
his
back
and
talked
to
jim
of
in
his
jade
and
how
no
should
be
stuped
or
caulked
the
rabble
in
the
archway
not
yet
baulked
came
crowding
nearer
and
the
boys
began
who
was
it
took
your
mistress
master
married
man
who
was
it
master
took
your
wife
away
i
let
another
man
take
mine
she
had
two
husbands
on
her
wedding
day
see
at
a
blush
he
blushed
as
red
as
wine
ought
a
had
a
laid
on
fine
the
farmers
in
the
courtyard
watched
the
baiting
grinning
the
barmaids
grinned
above
the
window
grating
then
through
the
mob
of
brawlers
michael
stepped
straight
to
where
lion
stood
i
come
he
said
to
give
you
back
some
words
which
i
have
kept
safe
in
my
heart
till
i
could
see
them
paid
you
lied
about
sue
jones
she
died
a
maid
as
far
as
concerned
and
your
lie
full
in
your
throat
and
there
and
there
and
in
your
eye
and
for
stealing
mary
as
he
struck
he
slipped
upon
a
piece
of
peel
and
dropped
souse
in
a
puddle
of
the
courtyard
muck
loud
laughter
followed
when
he
rose
up
sopped
friends
rushed
to
intervene
the
fight
was
stopped
the
two
were
hurried
out
by
different
ways
men
said
stopped
for
now
but
not
for
many
days
april
appeared
the
green
impulse
came
pushing
the
singing
sap
until
each
bud
trembled
with
delicate
life
as
soft
as
flame
filled
by
the
mighty
as
with
blood
death
was
at
ebb
and
life
in
brimming
flood
but
little
joy
in
life
could
lion
see
striving
to
gird
his
will
to
set
his
loved
one
free
while
in
his
heart
a
hope
still
struggled
dim
that
the
mad
hour
would
pass
the
darkness
break
the
fever
die
and
she
return
to
him
the
routed
nightmare
let
the
sleeper
wake
then
we
could
go
abroad
he
cried
and
make
a
new
life
soul
to
soul
oh
love
return
too
late
his
heart
replied
at
last
he
rode
to
learn
bowed
but
alive
with
hope
he
topped
the
pass
and
saw
below
her
cottage
by
the
way
white
in
a
garden
green
with
springing
grass
and
smoke
against
the
blue
sky
going
gray
god
make
us
all
the
happier
for
he
muttered
humbly
then
below
he
spied
mary
and
michael
entering
walking
side
by
side
arm
within
arm
like
lovers
like
dear
lovers
matched
by
the
happy
stars
and
newly
wed
over
whose
lives
a
rosy
presence
hovers
lion
dismounted
seeing
hope
was
dead
a
child
was
by
the
road
he
stroked
his
head
and
little
one
he
said
who
lives
below
there
in
the
cottage
there
where
those
two
people
go
they
do
the
child
said
pointing
gray
lives
in
the
cottage
there
and
he
does
too
been
back
near
a
week
since
being
away
it
was
but
seal
to
what
he
inly
knew
he
thanked
the
child
and
rode
the
spring
was
blue
bluer
than
ever
and
the
birds
were
glad
such
rapture
in
the
hedges
all
the
blackbirds
had
he
was
not
dancing
to
that
pipe
of
the
spring
he
reached
the
roughs
and
there
within
her
room
bowed
for
a
time
above
her
wedding
ring
which
had
so
chained
him
to
unhappy
doom
all
his
dead
marriage
haunted
in
the
gloom
of
that
deserted
chamber
all
her
things
lay
still
as
she
had
left
them
when
her
love
took
wings
he
kept
a
bitter
vigil
through
the
night
knowing
his
loss
his
ten
passion
wasted
his
life
all
blasted
even
at
its
height
his
cup
of
fulfilment
hardly
tasted
gray
on
the
budding
woods
the
morning
hasted
and
looking
out
he
saw
the
dawn
come
chill
over
the
shaking
acre
pale
with
daffodil
birds
were
beginning
in
the
meadows
soon
the
blackbirds
and
the
thrushes
with
their
singing
piped
down
the
withered
husk
that
was
the
moon
and
up
the
sky
the
ruddy
sun
came
winging
cows
plodded
past
yokes
clanked
the
men
were
bringing
milk
from
the
barton
someone
shouted
hup
dog
drive
them
dangy
red
ones
down
away
on
up
some
heavy
hours
went
by
before
he
rose
he
went
out
of
the
house
into
the
grass
down
which
the
wind
flowed
much
as
water
flows
the
daffodils
bowed
down
to
let
it
pass
at
the
edge
a
boggy
bit
there
was
right
at
the
north
corner
near
the
bridge
fenced
by
a
ridge
of
earth
he
sat
upon
the
ridge
watching
the
water
running
to
the
sea
watching
the
bridge
the
stile
the
path
beyond
where
the
white
sweetness
brought
the
bee
he
paid
the
price
of
being
overfond
the
water
babbled
always
from
the
pond
over
the
pretty
shallows
chattering
tinkling
with
trembles
from
the
sunlight
in
its
clearness
wrinkling
so
gazing
like
one
stunned
it
reached
his
mind
that
the
overhung
the
brook
more
than
was
right
making
the
selvage
blind
the
dragging
brambles
too
much
flotsam
took
dully
he
thought
to
mend
he
fetched
a
hook
and
standing
in
the
shallow
stream
he
slashed
for
hours
it
seemed
the
thorns
the
twigs
the
dead
leaves
splashed
splashed
and
were
bobbed
away
across
the
shallows
pale
grasses
with
the
sap
gone
from
them
fell
sank
or
were
carried
down
beyond
the
sallows
the
bruised
gave
out
earthy
smell
i
must
be
dead
he
thought
and
this
is
hell
fiercely
he
slashed
till
glancing
at
the
stile
he
saw
that
michael
stood
there
watching
with
a
smile
his
old
contemptuous
smile
of
careless
ease
as
though
the
world
with
all
its
myriad
pain
sufficed
but
only
just
sufficed
to
please
michael
was
there
the
robber
come
again
a
tumult
ran
like
flame
in
brain
then
looking
down
he
saw
the
flowers
shake
gold
trembling
daffodils
he
turned
he
plucked
a
stake
out
of
the
hedge
that
he
had
come
to
mend
and
flung
his
hook
to
michael
crying
take
we
two
will
settle
our
accounts
my
friend
once
and
for
ever
may
the
lord
god
make
you
see
your
sins
in
time
he
whirled
his
stake
and
struck
at
head
again
he
struck
while
michael
dodged
and
laughed
why
man
i
bring
you
luck
kill
a
bringer
of
good
news
you
fool
stop
it
and
listen
i
have
come
to
say
lion
for
sake
listen
and
be
cool
you
silly
hothead
put
that
stake
away
listen
i
tell
you
but
he
could
not
stay
the
anger
flaming
in
that
passionate
soul
blows
rained
upon
him
thick
they
stung
he
lost
control
till
if
you
want
to
fight
he
cried
let
be
let
me
get
off
the
bridge
and
we
will
fight
that
firm
bit
by
the
quag
will
do
for
me
so
be
on
guard
and
god
defend
the
right
you
foaming
madman
with
your
delight
smashing
a
man
with
stakes
before
he
speaks
on
guard
make
you
humbler
for
the
next
few
weeks
the
ground
was
level
there
the
daffodils
glimmered
and
danced
beneath
their
cautious
feet
quartering
for
openings
for
the
blow
that
kills
beyond
the
bubbling
brook
a
thrush
was
sweet
quickly
the
footsteps
slid
with
feint
and
cheat
the
weapons
poised
and
darted
and
withdrew
now
stop
it
michael
said
i
want
to
talk
to
you
we
do
not
stop
till
one
of
us
is
dead
said
lion
rushing
in
a
short
blow
fell
dizzily
through
all
guard
on
head
his
slashed
blindly
but
too
well
it
struck
in
side
then
for
a
spell
both
sorely
stricken
staggered
while
their
eyes
dimmed
under
mists
of
blood
they
fell
they
tried
to
rise
tried
hard
to
rise
but
could
not
so
they
lay
watching
the
clouds
go
sailing
on
the
sky
touched
with
a
redness
from
the
end
of
day
there
was
all
april
in
the
cry
and
lying
there
they
felt
they
had
to
die
die
and
go
under
mould
and
feel
no
more
green
fire
of
life
go
running
in
core
there
was
no
need
to
hit
me
michael
said
you
quiet
thinking
fellows
lose
control
this
fighting
business
is
a
foolish
trade
and
now
we
join
the
and
the
mole
i
tried
to
stop
you
a
crazy
soul
you
always
were
well
let
be
you
deep
and
passionate
souls
have
always
puzzled
me
sorry
that
i
struck
you
i
was
hit
and
lashed
out
blindly
at
you
you
were
mad
it
would
be
different
if
stopped
a
bit
you
are
too
blind
when
you
are
angry
lad
oh
i
am
giddy
lion
dying
bad
dying
he
raised
himself
he
sat
his
look
grew
greedy
for
the
water
bubbling
in
the
brook
and
as
he
watched
it
lion
raised
his
head
out
of
a
bloodied
clump
of
daffodil
michael
he
moaned
i
too
am
dying
dead
nearer
to
the
water
could
you
fill
your
hat
and
give
me
drink
or
would
it
spill
spill
i
expect
try
said
michael
try
i
may
as
well
die
trying
since
i
have
to
die
slowly
he
forced
his
failing
life
down
to
the
water
there
he
stooped
and
filled
and
as
his
back
turned
lion
drew
his
knife
and
hid
it
close
while
all
his
being
thrilled
to
see
as
michael
came
the
water
spilled
nearer
and
ever
nearer
bright
so
bright
drink
muttered
michael
drink
we
two
shall
sleep
he
tilted
up
the
hat
and
lion
drank
lion
lay
still
a
moment
gathering
power
then
rose
as
michael
gave
him
more
and
sank
then
like
a
dying
bird
whom
death
makes
tower
he
raised
himself
above
the
bloodied
flower
and
struck
with
all
his
force
in
side
you
should
not
have
done
that
his
stricken
comrade
cried
no
for
i
meant
to
tell
you
lion
meant
to
tell
you
but
i
can
not
now
i
die
that
hit
me
to
the
heart
and
i
am
spent
mary
and
i
have
parted
she
and
i
agreed
she
must
return
lad
that
is
why
i
came
to
see
you
she
is
coming
here
back
to
your
home
oh
my
beloved
dear
you
come
to
tread
a
bloody
path
of
flowers
all
the
gold
flowers
are
covered
up
with
blood
and
the
bright
bugles
blow
along
the
towers
the
bugles
triumph
like
the
plate
in
flood
his
spilled
life
trickled
down
upon
the
mud
between
weak
clutching
fingers
oh
he
cried
this
what
we
planned
here
years
ago
he
died
lion
lay
still
while
the
cold
tides
of
death
came
brimming
up
his
channels
with
one
hand
he
groped
to
know
if
michael
still
drew
breath
his
little
hour
was
running
out
its
sand
then
in
a
mist
he
saw
his
mary
stand
above
he
cried
aloud
he
was
my
brother
i
was
his
comrade
sworn
and
we
have
killed
each
other
oh
desolate
grief
beloved
and
through
me
we
wise
who
try
to
change
oh
you
wild
birds
help
my
unhappy
spirit
to
the
sea
the
golden
bowl
is
scattered
into
sherds
and
mary
knelt
and
murmured
passionate
words
to
that
poor
body
on
the
dabbled
flowers
oh
beauty
oh
sweet
soul
oh
little
love
of
ours
michael
my
own
darling
speak
me
mary
you
know
my
voice
here

oh
little
one

to
mary
dear
oh
michael

love

not
hear
and
you
have
killed
him
lion
he
is
dead
my
little
friend
my
love
my
michael
golden
head
we
had
such
fun
together
such
sweet
fun
my
love
and
i
my
merry
love
and
oh
love
you
shone
upon
me
like
the
sun
oh
michael
say
some
little
last
then
in
a
great
voice
lion
called
i
die
go
home
and
tell
my
people
mary
hear
though
i
have
wrought
this
ruin
i
have
loved
you
dear
better
than
he
not
better
dear
as
well
if
you
could
kiss
me
dearest
at
this
last
we
have
made
bloody
doorways
from
our
hell
cutting
our
tangle
now
the
murder
past
we
are
but
pitiful
poor
souls
and
fast
the
darkness
and
the
cold
come
kiss
me
sweet
i
loved
you
all
my
life
but
some
lives
never
meet
though
they
go
wandering
side
by
side
through
time
kiss
me
he
cried
she
bent
she
kissed
his
brow
oh
friend
she
said
lying
in
the
slime
three
blind
ones
dear
he
murmured
in
the
slough
caught
fast
for
death
but
never
mind
that
now
go
home
and
tell
my
people
i
am
dying
dying
dear
dying
now
he
died
she
left
him
lying
and
kissed
her
dead
head
and
crossed
the
field
they
have
been
killed
she
called
in
a
great
crying
killed
and
our
eyes
are
all
unsealed
the
blood
is
scattered
on
the
flowers
drying
it
was
the
hush
of
dusk
and
owls
were
flying
they
hooted
as
the
occleves
ran
to
bring
that
sorry
harvest
home
from
red
harvesting
they
laid
the
bodies
on
the
bed
together
and
you
were
beautiful
she
said
and
you
were
my
own
darling
in
the
april
weather
you
knew
my
very
soul
you
knew
you
knew
oh
my
sweet
piteous
love
i
was
not
true
fetch
me
fair
water
and
the
flowers
of
spring
my
love
is
dead
and
i
must
deck
his
burying
they
left
her
with
her
dead
they
could
not
choose
but
grant
the
spirit
burning
in
her
face
rights
that
their
pity
urged
them
to
refuse
they
did
her
sorrow
and
the
dead
a
grace
all
night
they
heard
her
passing
footsteps
trace
down
to
the
garden
from
the
room
of
death
they
heard
her
singing
there
lowly
with
gentle
breath
to
the
cool
darkness
full
of
sleeping
flowers
then
back
still
singing
soft
with
quiet
tread
but
at
the
dawn
her
singing
gathered
powers
like
to
the
dying
swan
who
lifts
his
head
on
eastnor
lifts
it
singing
dabbled
red
singing
the
glory
in
his
tumbling
mind
before
the
doors
burst
in
before
death
strikes
him
blind
so
triumphing
her
song
of
love
began
ringing
across
the
meadows
like
old
woe
sweetened
by
poets
to
the
help
of
man
unconquered
in
eternal
overthrow
like
a
great
trumpet
from
the
long
ago
her
singing
towered
all
the
valley
heard
men
jingling
down
to
meadow
stopped
their
teams
and
stirred
and
they
the
occleves
hurried
to
the
door
and
burst
it
fearing
there
the
singer
lay
drooped
at
her
bedside
on
the
floor
singing
her
passionate
last
of
life
away
white
flowers
had
fallen
from
a
blackthorn
spray
over
her
loosened
hair
pale
flowers
of
spring
filled
the
white
room
of
death
they
covered
everything
primroses
daffodils
and
she
bowed
her
singing
head
on
breast
oh
it
was
sweet
she
cried
that
love
of
ours
you
were
the
dearest
sweet
i
loved
you
best
beloved
my
beloved
let
me
rest
by
you
forever
little
michael
mine
now
the
great
hour
is
stricken
and
the
bread
and
wine
broken
and
spilt
and
now
the
homing
birds
draw
to
a
covert
michael
i
to
you
bury
us
two
together
came
her
words
the
dropping
petals
fell
about
the
two
her
heart
had
broken
she
was
dead
they
drew
her
gentle
head
aside
they
found
it
pressed
against
the
broidered
spread
on
breast
the
one
that
bore
her
name
in
hair
given
so
long
before
they
let
her
lie
while
the
dim
moon
died
out
upon
the
air
and
happy
sunlight
coloured
all
the
sky
the
last
cock
crowed
for
morning
carts
went
by
smoke
rose
from
cottage
chimneys
from
the
byre
the
yokes
went
clanking
by
to
dairy
through
the
mire
in
the
noise
the
noise
was
stilled
but
still
it
slipped
along
the
cold
dropping
from
leafy
hollows
which
it
filled
on
to
the
pebbly
shelves
which
made
it
sing
glints
glittered
on
it
from
the
wing
it
saw
the
moorhen
nesting
then
it
stayed
in
a
great
space
of
reeds
where
merry
otters
played
slowly
it
loitered
past
the
shivering
reeds
into
a
mightier
water
thence
its
course
becomes
a
pasture
where
the
salmon
feeds
wherein
no
bubble
tells
its
humble
source
but
the
great
waves
go
rolling
and
the
horse
snorts
at
the
bursting
waves
and
will
not
drink
and
the
great
ships
go
outward
bubbling
to
the
brink
outward
with
men
upon
them
stretched
in
line
handling
the
halliards
to
the
gates
where
flicking
windflaws
fill
the
air
with
brine
and
all
the
ocean
opens
then
the
mates
cry
and
the
sunburnt
crew
no
longer
waits
but
sing
triumphant
and
the
topsail
fills
to
this
old
tale
of
woe
