the
departure

forest
where
the
light
laughs
in
through
the
and
sports
with
the
tangled
glade
in
the
depths
of
an
afric
forest
my
earliest
scenes
were
laid
illustration
in
a
bower
that
was
merry
with
smilax
from
the
grimace
of
i
woke
i
was
born
on
the
first
day
of
april
and
they
called
me
a
jungle
joke
illustration
illustration
and
the
voices
of
birds
were
about
me
and
the
beat
and
the
flutter
of
wing
while
morning
returned
at
the
trumpet
of
tusky
our
elephant
king

my
nurse
was
a
crooning
old
beldame
who
gazed
in
the
palms
of
my
hands
and
vowed
i
was
destined
to
travel
in
many
and
marvellous
lands
illustration
but
little
i
heeded
her
croaking
for
i
gamboled
the
whole
day
long
and
swung
by
my
tail
from

for
the
sport

but
alas
for
the
boasts
of
the
jungle
the
men
came
among
us
one
day
and
one
with
a
box
that
made
music
enticed
foolish
monkeys
away
the
birds
and
the
beasts
of
the
forest
were
mute
at
the
marvellous
song
but
the
monkeys
crept
out
of
the
an
eager
and
wondering
throng
illustration
the
birds
and
the
beasts
of
the
forest
kept
hidden
and
silent
that
day
but
the
formed
a
procession
and
followed
the
minstrel
away
and
thus
did
we
give
up
the
forest
to
dwell
with
our
brothers
the
men
farewell
to
the
beautiful
jungle
was
long
ere
i
saw
it
again
illustration
illustration
illustration
part
second
the
ways
of
men
then
away
to
a
far
distant
country
on
a
drift
that
they
said
was
a
ship
and
i
studied
the
ways
of
my
master
and
profited
much
by
the
trip
and
we
sailed
to
his
home
in
fair
naples
where
i
studied
the
language
of
men
and
i
sat
on
a
bench
with
his
children
but
soon
we
went
sailing
again
illustration
illustration
and
i
made
some
nice
friends
on
the
voyage
and
engaged
in
a
pretty
romance
i
charmed
all
the
ladies
by
climbing
and
one
of
them
taught
me
to
dance
illustration
yet
often
i
longed
for
the
jungle
its
song
and
the
rustle
of
wing
and
sometimes
at
night
in
my
slumber
i
talked
with
our
elephant
king
illustration
illustration
one
morning
my
master
awoke
me
and
dressed
in
a
gaudy
new
suit
i
beheld
the
new
world
in
the
sunlight
and
lifted
my
hat
in
salute
and
then
began
troubles
and
trials
through
the
streets
by
a
string
i
was
led
toiling
hard
all
the
day
for
my
master
yet
oft
going
hungry
to
bed
illustration
illustration
illustration
but
he
sold
me
at
last
to
a
circus
and
my
lot
became
easier
then
so
i
gave
many
moments
of
leisure
to
acquiring
the
habits
of
men
i
copied
their
manners
and
customs
i
made
of
each
fashion
a
note
and
the
children
admired
my
performance
and
the
ladies
the
cut
of
my
coat
illustration
illustration
by
and
by
i
was
sold
to
a
banker
who
was
charmed
with
my
feat
and
arrayed
in
a
fauntleroy
costume
i
passed
all
my
time
on
the
street
illustration
illustration
but
alas
for
my
plans
of
the
future
he
died
without
leaving
a
cent
and
i
had
to
go
out
to
hard
labor
to
pay
for
my
victuals
and
rent
till
i
met
with
a
gentleman
valet
who
was
like
me
in
manner
and
face
and
i
told
him
some
stories
that
pleased
him
and
bribed
him
to
give
me
his
place
illustration
illustration
illustration
then
i
started
to
serve
my
new
master
a
bachelor
cynic
was
he
who
quickly
saw
through
the
deception
and
made
a
proposal
to
me
said
he
you
a
monkey
you
rascal
and
an
excellent
type
of
the
brood
let
play
a
good
joke
on
society
by
passing
you
off
as
a
dude
illustration
illustration
illustration
so
he
took
me
at
first
to
his
barber
who
shaved
me
and
shortened
my
hair
and
the
last
tangled
trace
of
the
jungle
was
gone
when
i
rose
from
his
chair
illustration
illustration
and
then
to
his
tailor
and
hatter
his
hosier
and
all
of
the
rest
till
at
night
i
was
changed
from
a
monkey
to
a
chappie
most
stylishly
dressed
and
standing
alone
and
reflecting
i
thought
of
the
why
and
the
how
and
i
wondered
what
tusky
was
doing
and
what
would
the
jungle
say
now
illustration

part
third
the
butterfly
whirl
it
was
then
for
the
triumphs
of
conquest
oh
then
for
the
life
of
the
swell
i
dwelt
like
a
lord
with
my
patron
in
a
suite
of
a
gilded
hotel
and
we
went
out
to
plays
and
to
dinners
on
the
ladies
he
took
me
to
call
and
once
we
received
invitations
to
a
beautiful
ball
illustration
illustration
was
a
famous
affair
and
it
won
me
with
its
titter
and
tinsel
and
tune
for
it
carried
me
back
to
the
jungle
and
the
under
the
moon
then
i
mingled
with
other
diversions
i
learned
how
to
paint
and
to
ride
i
cut
a
great
figure
at
polo
the
science
of
golfing
i
tried
illustration
illustration
as
a
wheelman
i
soon
became
famous
and
made
a
great
score
on
the
track
i
was
known
as
the
king
of
the
scorchers
with
the
typical
bicycle
back
then
a
girl
who
was
youthful
and
silly
made
love
to
me
just
for
a
lark
and
came
with
an
elegant
turnout
and
took
me
to
drive
in
the
park
illustration
illustration
illustration
and
i
took
her
out
boating
next
morning
for
the
face
of
my
charmer
was
fair
it
carried
me
back
to
the
jungle
to
the
that
were
blossoming
there
illustration
illustration
but
soon
in
the
midst
of
my
pleasure
in
the
glow
of
a
roseate
dream
the
boat
struck
a
rock
and
tipped
over
and
tumbled
us
both
in
the
stream
then
ho
for
the
skill
of
the
jungle
the
deftness
of
foot
and
of
hand
for
i
hung
from
a
limb
and
i
saved
her
and
drew
her
at
last
to
the
strand
illustration
illustration
illustration
and
then
to
her
home
i
went
proudly
to
claim
the
fair
maid
for
my
own
but
her
father
demanded
a
title
and
hardened
his
heart
like
a
stone
and
now
came
the
death
of
my
patron
that
left
me
alone
in
the
strife
and
yearning
once
more
for
the
jungle
i
turned
to
political
life
illustration
part
fourth
the
return
path
then
i
studied
a
week
to
gain
knowledge
and
waded
through
volumes
of
stuff
and
i
found
that
the
only
requirements
were
cunning
and
blarney
and
bluff
and
these
i
had
brought
from
the
jungle
inherited
straight
from
my
race
with
a
gift
for
political
music
and
a
truly
political
face
illustration
illustration
illustration
thus
feeling
at
home
in
my
labors
my
plan
was
successful
of
course
and
when
they
came
round
with
appointments
they
gave
me
a
job
on
the
force
and
such
was
my
skill
as
a
roundsman
and
talent
in
keeping
the
peace
that
i
rose
in
a
year
to
be
captain
and
then
to
be
chief
of
police
illustration
illustration
illustration
and
then
as
my
years
were
advancing
so
great
was
their
honor
and
trust
that
they
twined
me
a
chaplet
of
laurel
and
sculptured
in
marble
my
bust
illustration
illustration
yet
often
i
dreamed
of
the
jungle
its
song
and
the
rustle
of
wing
and
sometimes
still
talked
in
my
slumber
with
tusky
our
elephant
king
when
lo
my
political
party
that
now
was
in
power
and
supreme
conferred
a
most
noble
appointment
that
realized
all
of
my
dream
illustration
illustration
for
they
made
me
their
african
envoy
and
soon
i
went
sailing
again
to
meet
my
old
playmates
and
tell
them
the
ways
and
the
customs
of
men
to
calm
the
dusk
native
and
gather
my
people
in
nooks
to
tell
them
my
story
and
teach
them
the
wisdom
that
cometh
of
books
illustration
illustration
the
words
and
the
ways
of
and
deliver
my
race
from
its
ban
for
man
did
not
spring
from
the
monkey
but
monkey
from
man
