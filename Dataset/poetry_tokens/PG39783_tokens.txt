ah
time
hath
driven
out
the
rose
and
crimson
dew
is
fallen
on

ere

the

fairer

sows

and
puts
off

fairer
than
petals
on

morning
blown

the

hath
shed
his

petals
down
to
make
them
fair
fairer
than
these
the

and
joy
goes
weeping
in
her
scarlet
train
iii
the
faint
damp
wind
that
ere

even
blows
piling
the
west
with
many
a
tawny
sheaf
then
when
the
last
glad
wavering
hours
are
mown
sigheth
and
dies
because
the
day
is
sped
this
wind
is
like
her
and
the
listless
air
wherewith
she
goeth
by
beneath
the
trees
the
trees
that
mock
her
with
their
scarlet
stain
iv
love
that
is
born
of
time
and
comes
and
goes
love
that
doth
hold
all
noble
hearts
in
fief
as
red
leaves
follow
where
the
wind
hath
flown
so
all
men
follow
love
when
love
is
dead
o
fate
of
wind
o
wind
that
can
not
spare
but
drivest
out
the
maid
and
pourest

all
thy

my

grown

so
grief
hath
taken
all
mine

driven
forth
my

bows

ember

my
heart
new

hath
no
such
relief
nor
thought
of
spring
whose
blossom
he
hath
known
hath
turned
him
back
where
spring
is
banished
barren
the

my
canzon
through

to
him
who
speaketh
words
as
fair
as
these
say
that
i
also
know
the
yearly
slain
canzon
the
spear
i
is
the
clear
light
of
love
i
praise
that
steadfast
gloweth
deep
waters
a
clarity
that
gleams
always
though
man
soul
pass
through
troubled
waters
strange
ways
to
him
are
openèd
to
shore
the
beaten
ship
is
sped
if
only
love
of
light
give
aid
ii
that
fair
far
spear
of
light
now
lays
its
long
gold
shaft
upon
the
waters
ah
might
i
pass
upon
its
rays
to
where
it
gleams
beyond
the
waters
or
might
my
troubled
heart
be
fed
upon
the
frail
clear
light
there
shed
then
were
my
pain
at
last
allay
iii
although
the
clouded
storm
dismays
many
a
heart
upon
these
waters
the
thought
of
that
far
golden
blaze
giveth
me
heart
upon
the
waters
thinking
thereof
my
bark
is
led
to
port
wherein
no
storm
i
dread
no
tempest
maketh
me
afraid
iv
yet
when
within
my
heart
i
gaze
upon
my
fair
beyond
the
waters
meseems
my
soul
within
me
prays
to
pass
straightway
beyond
the
waters
though
i
be
alway
banished
from
ways
and
woods
that
she
doth
tread
one
thing
there
is
that
doth
not
fade
v
deep
in
my
heart
that
stays
that
wound
i
gat
beyond
the
waters
deeper
with
passage
of
the
days
that
pass
as
swift
and
bitter
waters
while
a
dull
fire
within
my
head
moveth
itself
if
word
be
said
which
hath
concern
with
that
far
maid
vi
my
love
is
lovelier
than
the
sprays
of
eglantine
above
clear
waters
or
whitest
lilies
that
upraise
their
heads
in
midst
of
moated
waters
no
poppy
in
the
mead
would
match
her
quivering
lips
red
if
her
lips
it
should
be
laid
vii
the
light
within
her
eyes
which
slays
base
thoughts
and
stilleth
troubled
waters
is
like
the
gold
where
sunlight
plays
upon
the
still
waters
when
anger
is
there
mingled
there
comes
a
keener
gleam
instead
like
flame
that
burns
beneath
thin
jade
viii
know
by
the
words
here
mingled
what
love
hath
made
my
heart
his
stead
glowing
like
flame
beneath
thin
jade
canzon
to
be
sung
beneath
a
window
i
heart
mine
art
mine
whose
embraces
clasp
but
wind
that
past
thee
bloweth
this
air
so
subtly
gloweth
guerdoned
by
thy
traces
that
my
heart
is
half
afraid
for
the
fragrance
on
him
laid
even
so
love
might
amazes
ii
man
love
follows
many
faces
my
love
only
one
face
knoweth
towards
thee
only
my
love
floweth
and
outstrips
the
swift
stream
paces
were
this
love
well
here
displayed
as
flame
flameth
thin
jade
love
should
glow
through
these
my
phrases
iii
though
i
roamed
through
many
places
none
there
is
that
my
heart
troweth
fair
as
that
wherein
fair
groweth
one
whose
laud
here
interlaces
tuneful
words
that
i
essayed
let
this
tune
be
gently
played
which
my
voice
herward
upraises
iv
if
my
praise
her
grace
effaces
then
is
not
my
heart
that
showeth
but
the
skilless
tongue
that
soweth
words
unworthy
of
her
graces
tongue
that
hath
me
so
betrayed

he
that
is
lord
of
all

hath
unto
me
from
his
magnificence
granted
such
vision

hath
wrought

last
defence

shieldeth
mortal

splendours

of
high
holiness
from

to
clarity
ascending
through
all
the
roofless
tacit
courts
extending

subtle
light
doth

as

the
stars

ye
herefrom
of
their

ii
withdrawn
within
the
cavern
of
his
wings
grave
with
the
joy
of
thoughts
beneficent
and
finely
wrought
and
durable
and
clear
if
so
his
eyes
showed
forth
the
mind
content
so
sate
the
first
to
whom
remembrance
clings
tissued
like
bat
wings
did
his
wings
appear
not
of
that
shadowy
colouring
and
drear
but
as
thin
shells
pale
saffron
luminous
alone
unlonely
whose
calm
glances
shed
friend
love
to
strangers
though
no
word
were
said
pensive
his
godly
state
he
keepeth
thus
not
with
his
surfaces

power
endeth

cloudy

swiftly
gone

third
most
glorious
of
these
majesties
give

o
sapphires

eternal

by
your
light
illume
pure
verity
that
azure
feldspar
hight
the
microcline
or
on
its
wing

menelaus
weareth
such
subtlety
of
shimmering
as
beareth
this
marvel
onward
through
the
crystalline
a
splendid
calyx
that
about
her
gloweth
smiting
the
sunlight
on
whose
ray
she
goeth
iv
the
diver
at
sorrento
from
beneath
the
vitreous
indigo
who
swiftly
riseth
by
will
and
not
by
action
as
it
seemeth
moves
not
more
smoothly
and
no
thought
surmiseth
how
she
takes
motion
from
the
lustrous
sheath
which
as
the
trace
behind
the
swimmer
gleameth
yet
presseth
back
the
aether
where
it
streameth
to
her
whom
it
adorns
this
sheath
imparteth
the
living
motion
from
the
light
surrounding
and
thus
my
nobler
parts
to
grief
confounding
impart
into
my
heart
a
peace
which
starteth
from
one
round
whom
a
graciousness
is
cast

clingeth
in

she
hath
past

face
a

the

that
broke
the

the

the

evanoe
a

not

out
somewhere
beyond

her
gold
is
spread
above
around
inwoven
strange
ways
and

are
fashioned
out
of
it
and
i
have
seen
my
lady
in
the
sun
her
hair
was
spread
about
a
sheaf
of
wings
and
red
the
sunlight
was
behind
it
all
and
i
have
seen
her
there
within
her
house
with
six
great
sapphires
hung
along
the
wall
low
with
her
knees
and
all
her
robe
was
woven
of
pale
gold
there
are
there
many
rooms
and
all
of
gold
of
woven
walls
deep
patterned
of

of
beaten
work
and
through
the
claret
stone
set
to
some

comes
the
aureate
light
here
am
i
come
perforce
my
love
of
her
behold
mine
adoration
maketh
me
clear

there

which
played

at

rather

to
look
back
upon
as

not
