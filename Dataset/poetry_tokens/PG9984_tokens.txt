nesteth
my
little
home
behind
my
father
cottage
lies
a
gentle
grassy
height
up
which
i
often
ran
to
gaze
back
with
a
wondering
sight
for
then
the
chimneys
i
thought
high
were
down
below
me
quite
all
round
i
turned
mine
eyes
huge
hills
closed
up
the
view
the
town
their
converging
roots
was
clasped
by
rivers
two
from
one
range
to
another
sprang
the
sky
great
vault
of
blue
it
was
a
joy
to
climb
their
sides
and
in
the
heather
lie
a
joy
to
look
at
vantage
down
on
the
castle
grim
and
high
blue
streams
below
white
clouds
above
in
silent
earth
and
sky
and
now
my
feet
may
roam
at
sight
of
stranger
hill
a
new
sense
of
the
old
delight
springs
in
my
bosom
still
and
longings
for
the
high
unknown
their
ancient
channels
fill
for
i
am
always
climbing
hills
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
surely
at
last
on
some
high
peak
to
find
my
father
throne
though
hitherto
i
have
only
found
his
footsteps
in
the
stone
and
in
my
wanderings
i
did
meet
another
searching
too
the
dawning
hope
the
shared
quest
our
thoughts
together
drew
fearless
she
laid
her
band
in
mine
because
her
heart
was
true
she
was
not
born
among
the
hills
yet
on
each
mountain
face
a
something
known
her
inward
eye
by
inborn
light
can
trace
for
up
the
hills
must
homeward
be
though
no
one
knows
the
place
clasp
my
hand
close
my
child
in
thine
a
long
way
we
have
come
clasp
my
hand
closer
yet
my
child
farther
we
yet
must
roam
climbing
and
climbing
till
we
reach
our
heavenly
father
home
hark
the
rain
is
on
my
roof
every
murmur
through
the
dark
stings
me
with
a
dull
reproof
like
a
spark
me
ah
me
how
came
i
here
wide
awake
and
wide
alone
caught
within
a
net
of
fear
all
my
dreams
undreamed
and
gone
i
will
rise
i
will
go
forth
better
dare
the
hideous
night
better
face
the
freezing
north
than
be
still
where
is
no
light
black
wind
rushing
round
me
now
sown
with
arrowy
points
of
rain
gone
are
there
and
then
and
now
i
am
here
and
so
is
pain
dead
in
dreams
the
gloomy
street
i
will
out
on
open
roads
eager
grow
my
aimless
feet
onward
onward
something
goads
i
will
take
the
mountain
path
beard
the
storm
within
its
den
know
the
worst
of
this
dim
wrath
harassing
the
souls
of
men
chasm
chasm

piled
on
rock
roots
and
crumbling
earth

the

shock

groans
ah
i
faint
i
fall
i
die
sink
to
nothingness
away
lo
a
streak
upon
the
sky
lo
the
opening
eye
of
day
ii
mountain
summits
lift
their
snows
a
valley
green
and
low
and
a
winding
pathway
goes
guided
by
the
river
flow
and
a
music
rises
ever
as
of
peace
and
low
content
from
the
river
like
an
odour
upward
sent
and
the
sound
of
ancient
harms
moans
behind
the
hills
among
like
the
humming
of
the
swarms
that
unseen
the
forest
throng
now
i
meet
the
shining
rain
from
a
cloud
with
sunny
weft
now
against
the
wind
i
strain
sudden
burst
from
mountain
cleft
now
a
sky
that
hath
a
moon
staining
all
the
cloudy
white
with
a
faded
rainbow
soon
lost
in
deeps
of
heavenly
night
now
a
morning
clear
and
soft
amber
on
the
purple
hills
warm
blue
day
of
summer
oft
cooled
by
wandering
windy
rills
joy
to
travel
thus
along
with
the
universe
around
every
creature
of
the
throng
every
sight
and
scent
and
sound
homeward
speeding
beelike
to
its
hive

soul

hills
retreating
on

hand
slowly
sink
into
the
plain
solemn
through
the
outspread
land
rolls
the
river
to
the
main
in
the
glooming
of
the
night
something
through
the
dusky
air
doubtful
glimmers
faintly
white
but
i
know
not
what
or
where
is
it
but
a
chalky
ridge
bared
of
sod
like
tree
of
bark
or
a
bridge
miles
away
into
the
dark
or
the
foremost
leaping
waves
of
the
everlasting
sea
where
the
undivided
laves
time
with
its
eternity
is
it
but
an
sight
in
my
brain
a
fancied
gleam
or
a
faint
from
the
sun
tired
smoking
team
in
the
darkness
it
is
gone
yet
with
every
step
draws
nigh
known
shall
be
the
thing
unknown
when
the
morning
climbs
the
sky
onward
onward
through
the
night
matters
it
i
can
not
see
i
am
moving
in
a
might
dwelling
in
the
dark
and
me
end
or
way
i
can
not
lose
grudge
to
rest
or
fear
to
roam
all
is
well
with
wanderer
whose
heart
is
travelling
hourly
home
iv
joy
o
joy
the
dawning
sea
answers
to
the
dawning
sky
foretaste
of
the
coming
glee
when
the
sun
will
lord
it
high
see
the
swelling
radiance
growing
to
a
dazzling
see
the
shadows
gently
going
the
wild
with
light
hear
the
smiting
billows
clang
see
the
falling
billows
lean
half
a
watery
vault
and
hang
gleaming
with
translucent
green
then
in
thousand
fleeces
fall
thundering
light
upon
the
strand
this
the
whiteness
which
did
call
through
the
dusk
across
the
land
see
a
boat
out
out
we
dance
fierce
blasts
swoop
upon
my
sail
what
a
terrible
expanse
tumbling
hill
and
heaving
dale
stayless
helpless
lost
i
float
captive
to
the
lawless
free
but
a
prison
is
my
boat
oh
for
to
flee
look
below
each
watery
whirl
cast
in
beauty
living
mould
look
above
each
feathery
curl
dropping
crimson
dropping
gold
oh
i
tremble
in
the
flush
of
the
everlasting
youth
love
and
awe
together
rush
i
am
free
in
god
the
truth
tree
alas
is
cold
and
dark
the
wind
all
night
hath
sung
a
wintry
tune
hail
from
black
clouds
that
swallowed
up
the
moon
beat
beat
against
my
bark
oh
why
delays
the
spring
not
yet
the
sap
moves
in
my
frozen
veins
through
all
my
stiffened
roots
creep
numbing
pains
that
i
can
hardly
cling
the
sun
shone
i
felt
the
glow
down
every
fibre
float
and
thought
i
heard
a
thrush
piping
note
of
dim
born
then
on
the
salt
gale
driven
the
streaming
cloud
hissed
through
my
outstretched
arms
tossed
me
about
in
slanting
snowy
swarms
and
blotted
out
the
heaven
all
night
i
brood
and
choose
among
past
joys
oh
for
the
breath
of
june
the
feathery
quavering
from
the
moon
the
slow
baptizing
dews
oh
the
birds
they
are
the
tongues
of
us
mute
longing
trees
aha
the
billowy
odours
and
the
bees
that
browse
like
scattered
herds
the
showers
that
thrill
with
gratefulness
my
youngest
shoot
the
children
playing
round
my
root
from
burning
hours
see
see
the
heartless
dawn
with
naked
chilly
arms
latticed
across
another
weary
day
of
moaning
loss
on
the
lawn
but
icy
winter
past
yea
climbing
suns
persuade
the
relenting
wind
i
will
endure
with
steadfast
patient
mind
my
leaves
come
at
last
i
a
skilful
were
i
a
skilful
painter
my
pencil
not
my
pen
should
try
to
teach
thee
hope
and
fear
and
who
would
blame
me
then
fear
of
the
tide
of
darkness
that
floweth
fast
behind
and
hope
to
make
thee
journey
on
in
the
journey
of
the
mind
were
i
a
skilful
painter
what
should
i
paint
for
thee
a
tiny
peeping
out
from
a
withered
wintry
tree
the
warm
blue
sky
of
summer
jagged
ice
and
snow
and
water
hurrying
gladsome
out
from
a
cavern
down
below
the
dim
light
of
a
beacon
upon
a
stormy
sea
where
a
lonely
ship
to
windward
beats
for
life
and
liberty
a
watery
gleaming
athwart
a
sullen
cloud
and
falling
on
some
grassy
flower
the
rain
had
earthward
bowed
morn
peeping
a
mountain
in
ambush
for
the
dark
and
a
traveller
in
the
vale
below
rejoicing
like
a
lark
a
taper
nearly
vanished
amid
the
dawning
gray
and
a
maiden
lifting
up
her
head
and
lo
the
coming
day
i
am
no
skilful
painter
let
who
will
blame
me
then
that
i
would
teach
thee
hope
and
fear
with
my
pen
fear
of
the
tide
of
darkness
that
floweth
fast
behind
and
hope
to
make
thee
journey
on
in
the
journey
of
the
mind
and
the
fact
which
suggested
this
poem
is
related
by
clarke
in
his
travels
i
blue
sky
above
blue
sea
below
far
off
the
old
nile
mouth
a
blue
world
wherein
did
blow
a
soft
wind
from
the
south
in
great
and
solemn
heaves
the
mass
of
pulsing
ocean
beat
unwrinkled
as
the
sea
of
glass
beneath
the
holy
feet
with
forward
leaning
of
desire
the
ship
sped
calmly
on
a
pilgrim
strong
that
would
not
tire
or
hasten
to
be
gone
ii
list
on
the
wave
what
can
they
be
those
sounds
that
hither
glide
no
lovers
whisper
tremulously
under
the
ship
round
side
no
sail
across
the
dark
blue
sphere
holds
white
obedient
way
no
boat
is
near
no
following
fish
at
play
is
not
the
rippling
of
the
wave
nor
sighing
of
the
cords
no
winds
or
waters
ever
gave
a
murmur
so
like
words
nor
wings
of
birds
that
northward
strain
nor
talk
of
hidden
crew
the
traveller
questioned
but
in
vain
he
found
no
answer
true
iii
a
hundred
level
miles
away
on
egypt
troubled
shore
two
nations
fought
that
sunny
day
with
bellowing
cannons
roar
the
fluttering
whisper
low
and
near
was
that
far
battle
blare
a
lipping
rippling
motion
here
the
blasting
thunder
there
iv
can
this
dull
sighing
in
my
breast
so
faint
and
undefined
be
the
worn
edge
of
far
unrest
borne
on
the
spirit
wind
the
uproar
of
high
battle
fought
betwixt
the
bond
and
free
the
thunderous
roll
of
armed
thought
dwarfed
to
an
ache
in
me
to
is
a
little
room
my
friend
baby
walks
from
end
to
end
all
the
things
look
sadly
real
this
hot
noontide
unideal
vaporous
heat
from
cope
to
basement
all
you
see
outside
the
casement
save
one
house
all
and
a
street
all
there
behold
its
happiest
vision
trickling
derision
shut
we
out
the
staring
space
draw
the
curtains
in
its
face
close
the
eyelids
of
the
room
fill
it
with
a
scarlet
gloom
lo
the
walls
with
warm
flush
dyed
lo
the
ceiling
glorified
as
when
lost
in
tenderest
pinks

gazing
a

land
shining
streams
like
silver
veins
rise
in
dells
and
meet
in
plains
up
yon
brook
a
hollow
lies
dumb
as
love
that
fears
surprise
moorland
tracts
of
broken
ground
it

and
close
it
round
he
who
climbs
from
bosky
dale
hears
the
foggy
breezes
wail
yes
thou
the
nest
of
love
the
waste
around
above
in
thy
soul
or
in
thy
past
straight
it
melts
into
the
vast
quickly
vanishes
away
in
a
gloom
of
darkening
gray
sinks
the
sadness
into
rest
ripple
like
on
water
breast
mother
bosom
rests
the
daughter
grief
the
ripple
love
the
water
and
thy
brain
like
lies
breathed
upon
from
distant
skies
till
visions
new
grow
like
vapours
in
the
blue
white
forms
flushing
hyacinthine
move
in

labyrinthine
with
an
airy
wishful
gait
on
the

the

of

master
of

while
the

for
such
mazy
marvelling
meet
press
from

a
shining
sound
rippling
after
lingering
round
hair
afloat
and
arms
aloft
fill
the
chord
of
movement
soft
gone
the
measure
polyhedral
towers
aloft
a
fair
cathedral
every
arch
like
praying
arms
upward
flung
in
love
alarms
knit
by
clasped
hands
heaves
to
heaven
a
weight
of
dread
in
thee
like
an
grows
the
music
praying
loud
swells
thy
spirit
with
devotion
as
a
strong
wind
swells
the
ocean
sweeps
the
visioned
pile
away
leaves
thy
heart
alone
to
pray
as
the
prayer
grows
dim
and
dies
like
a
sunset
from
the
skies
glides
another
change
of
mood
thy
inner
solitude
girt
with
music
magic
zone
lo
thyself
magician
grown
thou
through
earth
brooding
on
the
aeonian
birth
of
a
thousand
in
divine
dusk
of
their
springs
half
thou
seest
whence
they
flow
half
thou
seest
whither
go
nature

whereby
on
herself
she
turns
her
eye
hoping
for
all
men
and
thee
perfected
pure
harmony
but
when
sinking
slow
the
sun
leaves
the
glowing
curtain
dun
i
of
reft
shall
be
dull
and
dreamless
left
i
must
hasten
proof
on
proof
weaving
in
the
warp
my
woof
what
are
those
upon
the

ranged
in

symmetrical
through
the

to
the

lying
round
the
noisy
day
full
of
silences
alway
that
my
friend
now
it
is
curious
you
should
hit
upon
the
spurious
is
a
door
to
nowhere
that
never
soul
went
in
thereat
lies
behind
a
limy
wall
hung
with
cobwebs
that
is
all
do
not
open
that
one
yet
wait
until
the
sun
is
set
if
you
careless
lift
its
latch
glimpse
of
nothing
will
you
catch
mere
negation
blank
of
hue
out
of
it
will
stare
at
you

i
say
the
coming
night
fittest
time
for

then
the
wide
eyes
of
the

see
far
down
the
spirit
wind
you
may
have
to
strain
and
pull
force
and
lift
with
cunning
tool
ere
the
rugged
door
yield
the
sight
it
stands
before
when
at
last
with
grating
sweep
wide
it
swings
behold
the
deep
thou
art
standing
on
the
verge
where
material
things
emerge
hoary
silence
lightning
fleet
shooteth
hellward
at
thy
feet
fear
not
thou
whose
life
is
truth
gazing
will
renew
thy
youth
but
where
sin
of
soul
or
flesh
held
a
man
in
it
would
drag
him
through
that
door
give
him
up
to
loreless
lore
ages
to
be
blown
and
hurled
up
and
down
a
deedless
world
ah
your
eyes
ask
how
i
brook
doors
that
are
not
doors
to
look
that
is
whither
i
was
tending
and
it
brings
me
to
good
ending
baby
is
the
cause
of
this
odd
it
seems
but
so
it
is
baby
with
her
pretty
prate
molten
half
articulate
full
of
hints
suggestions
catches
broken
verse
and
music
snatches
she
like
seraph
gone
astray
must
be
shown
the
homeward
way
plant
of
heaven
she
rooted
lowly
must
put
forth
a
blossom
holy
must
through
culture
high
and
steady
slow
unfold
a
gracious
lady
she
must
therefore
live
in
wonder
see
nought
common
up
or
under
she
the
moon
and
stars
and
sea
worm
and
butterfly
and
bee
yea
the
sparkle
in
a
stone
must
with
marvel
look
upon
she
must
love
in
heaven
own
blueness
both
the
colour
and
the
newness
must
each
day
from
darkness
break
often
often
come
awake
never
with
her
childhood
part
change
the
brain
but
keep
the
heart
so
from
lips
and
hands
and
looks
she
must
learn
to
honour
books
turn
the
leaves
with
careful
fingers
never
lean
where
long
she
lingers
but
when
she
is
old
enough
she
must
learn
the
lesson
rough
that
to
seem
is
not
to
be
as
to
know
is
not
to
see
that
to
man
or
book
gives
no
title
to
revering
that
a
pump
is
not
a
well
nor
a
priest
an
oracle
this
to
leave
safe
in
her
mind
i
will
take
her
and
go
find
certain
dreary
apes
tell
her
they
are
mere
no
more
to
be
honoured
by
her
but
be
laid
upon
the
fire
must
not
hinder
their
consuming
to
a
cinder
would
you
see
the
small
immortal
one
short
pace
within
time
portal
i
will
fetch
is
she
white
solemn
true
a
light
in
light
see
is
not
her
white
as
whitest
ermelin
washed
in
palest
thinnest
rose
very
thought
of
god
she
goes
to
wander
in
her
dance
out
of
his
but
my
friend
i
rattled
plenty
to
suffice
for
mornings
twenty
i
should
never
stop
of
course
therefore
stop
i
will
if
i
led
them
up
choragic
to
reveal
their
nature
magic
twenty
things
past
contradiction
yet
would
prove
i
spoke
no
fiction
of
the
room
belongings
cryptic
read
by
light
apocalyptic
there
is
that
strange
thing
with
continual
questions
tasked
ticking
with
untiring
rock
it
is
called
an
clock
but
to
me
the
thing
appears
busy
winding
up
the
years
drawing
on
with
coiling
chain
the
epiphany
again
and
is
the
midnight
hour
i
heard
the
give
out
the
word
seldom
is
the
shed
on
some
dwarfed
head
in
the
deep
and
narrow
street
lying
at
my
feet
where
i
stand
at
lattice
high
downward
gazing
listlessly
from
my
house
upon
the
rock
peak
of
earth
there
her
windows
every
story
shine
with
nebulous
glory
round
her
in
that
luminous
cloud
stars
obedient
press
and
crowd
she
the
centre
of
all
gazing
she
the
sun
her
planets
dazing
in
her
eyes
victorious
lightning
some
are
paling
some
are
brightening
those
on
which
they
gracious
turn
stars
combust
all
tenfold
burn
those
from
which
they
look
away
listless
roam
in
twilight
gray
when
on
her
my
looks
i
bent
wonder
shook
me
like
a
tent
and
my
eyes
grew
dim
with
sheen
wasting
light
upon
its
queen
but
though
she
my
eyes
might
chain
rule
my
ebbing
flowing
brain
truth
alone
without
within
can
the
soul
high
homage
win
he
i
do
not
doubt
is
there
who
unveiled
my
idol
fair
and
i
thank
him
grateful
much
though
his
end
was
none
of
such
he
from
shapely
lips
of
wit
let
the
lightly
flit
scorching
as
the
snow
that
fell
on
the
damned
in
dante
hell
with
keen
gentle
opposition
playful
merciless
precision
mocked
the
sweet
romance
of
youth
balancing
on
spheric
truth
he
on
sense
firm
set
plane
rolled
the
unstable
ball
amain
with
a
smile
she
looked
at
me
stung
my
soul
and
set
me
free
welcome
friend
bring
in
your
bricks
mortar
there
no
need
to
mix
that
is
well
and
picks
and
hammers
verily
these
are
no
shammers
there
my
friend
build
up
that
niche
that
one
with
the
painting
rich
yes
you
right
it
is
a
show
picture
seldom
can
bestow
city
palaces
and
towers
terraced
gardens
twilight
bowers
vistas
deep
through
swaying
masts
pennons
flaunting
in
the
blasts
build
my
room
it
does
not
fit
is
the
thing
for
it
yes
a
window
you
may
call
it
not
the
less
up
you
must
wall
it
in
that
niche
the
dead
world
lies
bury
death
and
free
mine
eyes
there
were
youths
who
held
by
me
said
i
taught
yet
left
them
free
will
they
do
as
i
said
then
god
forbid
as
ye
are
men
find
the
secret
follow
and
find
all
forget
that
lies
behind
me
the
schools
yourselves
forsake
in
your
souls
a
silence
make
hearken
till
a
whisper
come
listen
follow
and
be
dumb
there
is
over
i
am
dead
of
my
life
the
broken
thread
here
i
cast
out
of
my
hand
o
my
soul
the
merry
land
on
my
heart
the
sinking
vault
of
my
ruining
past
makes
halt
ages
i
could
sit
and
moan
for
the
shining
world
that
gone
haste
and
pierce
the
other
wall
break
an
opening
to
the
all
where
no
matter
done
is
best
kind
of
window
let
that
rest
who
at
morning
ever
lies
pondering
how
to
ope
his
eyes
i
bethink
me
we
must
fall
on
the
thinnest
of
the
wall
there
it
must
be
in
that
niche
no
the
deepest
that
in
which
stands
the
crucifix
you
start
ah
your
heart
shrinks
from
that
as
sacrilege
or
at
least
upon
its
edge
worse
than
sacrilege
i
say
is
it
to
withhold
the
day
from
the
brother
whom
thou
knowest
for
the
god
thou
never
sawest
reverently
o
marble
cold
thee
in
living
arms
i
fold
thou
who
art
thyself
the
way
from
the
darkness
to
the
day
window
thou
to
every
land
wouldst
not
one
dread
moment
stand
shutting
out
the
air
and
sky
and
the
dayspring
from
on
high
brother
with
the
rugged
crown
gently
thus
i
lift
thee
down
give
me
pick
and
hammer
you
stand
aside
the
deed
i
do
yes
in
truth
i
have
small
skill
but
the
best
thing
is
the
will
stroke
on
stroke
the
frescoed
plaster
clashes
downward
fast
and
faster
hark
i
hear
an
outer
stone
down
the
rough
rock
rumbling
thrown
there
a
cranny
there
a
crack
the
great
sun
is
at
its
back
lo
a
mass
is
outward
flung
in
the
universe
hath
sprung
see
the
gold
upon
the
blue
see
the
sun
come
blinding
through
see
the
mountain
shine
in
the
dazzling
light
divine
prisoned
world
thy
captive
gone
welcome
wind
and
sky
and
sun
a
recollection
and
attempted
completion
of
a
prose
fragment
read
in
boyhood
thou
that
sound
upon
the
window
pane
said
the
youth
softly
as
outstretched
he
lay
where
for
an
hour
outstretched
he
had
lain
softly
yet
with
some
token
of
dismay
answered
the
maiden
it
is
but
the
rain
that
has
been
gathering
in
the
west
all
day
why
shouldst
thou
hearken
so
thine
eyelids
close
and
let
me
gather
peace
from
thy
repose
thou
that
moan
creeping
along
the
ground
said
the
youth
and
his
veiling
eyelids
rose
from
deeps
of
dark
profound
ruffled
with
herald
blasts
of
coming
woes
i
hear
it
said
the
maiden
is
the
sound
of
a
great
wind
that
here
not
seldom
blows
it
swings
the
huge
arms
of
the
dreary
pine
but
thou
art
safe
my
darling
clasped
in
mine
thou
the
baying
of
my
hounds
said
he
draw
back
the
lattice
bar
and
let
them
in
from
a
rent
cloud
the
moonlight
ghostily
slid
clearer
to
the
floor
as
gauntly
thin
she
opening
they
leaped
through
with
bound
so
free
then
shook
the
from
their
shaggy
skin
the
maiden
closed
the
glass
whose
spotted
shadow
through
the
room
did
pass
the
youth
was
leaning
on
his
hand
but
when
again
beside
him
sat
the
maid
his
eyes
for
one
slow
minute
having
scanned
her
moonlit
face
he
laid
him
down
and
said
monotonous
like
command
for
love
is
of
the
earth
earthy
and
is
laid
lifeless
at
length
back
in
the
strange
moanings
from
the
pine
entered
the
room
and
then
two
shadows
like
the
shadow
of
glass
over
the
moonbeams
on
the
cottage
floor
as
wind
almost
as
thin
and
shapeless
pass
a
sound
of
came
about
the
door
and
a
soft
sighing
as
of
plumy
grass
a
look
of
sorrowing
doubt
the
youth
face
wore
the
two
great
hounds
half
rose
with
aspect
grim
they
eyed
his
countenance
by
the
taper
dim
shadow
nor
moaning
sound
the
maiden
noted
but
on
his
face
dwelt
her
reproachful
look
she
doubted
whether
he
the
saying
had
quoted
out
of
some
evil
book
or
up
from
his
deep
heart
like
bubbles
had
floated
words
which
no
maiden
ever
yet
could
brook
but
his
eyes
held
the
question
yea
or
no
therefore
the
maiden
answered
nay
not
so
love
is
of
heaven
eternal
half
a
smile
just
twinned
his
lips
shy
like
all
human
best
a
hopeful
thought
bloomed
out
and
lived
a
while
he
looked
one
moment
like
a
dead
man
blest
his
soul
a
bark
that
in
a
sunny
isle
at
length
had
found
the
haven
of
its
rest
but
he
could
not
remain
must
forward
fare
he
spoke
and
said
with
words
abrupt
and
bare
maiden
i
have
loved
other
maidens
pale
her
red
lips
grew
i
loved
them
yes
but
they
successively
in
trial
hour
did
fail
for
after
sunset
clouds
again
are
gray
a
sudden
light
shone
through
the
fringy
veil
that
drooping
hid
her
eyes
and
then
there
lay
a
stillness
on
her
face
waiting
and
then
the
little
clock
rung
out
the
hour
of
ten
moaning
once
more
the
great
bow
to
a
soft
plaining
wind
they
would
not
stem
brooding
upon
her
face
the
youth
said
thou
art
not
more
beautiful
than
some
of
them
but
a
fair
courage
crowns
thy
peaceful
brow
nor
glow
thine
eyes
but
shine
serene
like
gem
that
lamps
from
radiant
store
upon
the
dark
the
light
it
gathered
where
its
song
the
lark
the
horse
that
broke
this
day
from
grasp
of
three
thou
sawest
then
the
hand
thou
holdest
hold
ere
two
fleet
hours
are
gone
that
hand
will
be
dry
wrinkled
withered
up
and
old
no
woman
yet
hath
shared
my
doom
with
me
with
calm
fixed
eyes
she
heard
till
he
had
told
the
rose
a
moment
gazed
at
him
then
laid
them
down
with
aspect
yet
more
grim
spake
on
the
youth
nor
altered
look
or
tone
is
thy
turn
maiden
to
say
no
or
dare
was
it
the
maiden
that
importunate
moan
at
midnight
when
the
moon
sets
wilt
thou
share
the
terror
with
me
or
must
i
go
alone
to
meet
an
agony
that
will
not
spare
she
answered
not
but
rose
to
take
her
cloak
he
staid
her
with
his
hand
and
further
spoke
not
yet
he
said
yet
there
is
respite
see
time
finger
points
not
yet
to
the
dead
hour
enough
is
left
even
now
for
telling
thee
the
far
beginnings
whence
the
fearful
power
of
the
great
dark
came
shadowing
down
on
me
red
roses
crowding
clothe
my
love
dear
bower
nightshade
and
hemlock
darnel
toadstools
white
compass
the
place
where
i
must
lie
around
his
neck
the
maiden
put
her
arm
and
knelt
beside
him
leaning
on
his
breast
as
his
love
to
keep
it
strong
and
warm
brooding
like
bird
outspread
upon
her
nest
and
well
the
faith
of
her
dear
eyes
might
charm
all
doubt
away
from
love
primeval
rest
he
hid
his
face
upon
her
heart
and
there
spake
on
with
voice
like
wind
from
lonely
lair
a
drearier
moaning
through
the
pine
did
go
as
if
a
human
voice
complained
and
cried
for
one
long
minute
then
the
sound
grew
low
sank
to
a
sigh
and
sighing
sank
and
died
together
at
the
silence
two
voices
mow
his
and
the
clock
which
loud
grown
did
divide
the
hours
into
live
moments
sparks
of
time
scorching
the
soul
that
trembles
for
the
chime
he
spoke
of
sins
ancestral
born
in
him
impulses
of
resistance
fierce
and
wild
of
failure
weak
and
strength
reviving
dim
dreariness
no
love
beguiled
of
storm
and
blasting
light
and
darkness
grim
of
torrent
paths
and
tombs
with
mountains
piled
of
gulfs
in
the
unsunned
bosom
of
the
earth
of
dying
ever
into
dawning
birth
but
when
i
find
a
heart
whose
blood
is
wine
whose
faith
lights
up
the
cold
brain
passionless
hour
whose
love
like
unborn
will
not
pine
but
waits
the
sun
and
the
baptizing
shower
till
then
lies
hid
and
gathers
odours
fine
to
greet
the
human
summer
when
its
flower
shall
blossom
in
the
heart
and
soul
and
brain
and
love
and
passion
be
one
holy
twain
then
shall
i
rest
rest
like
the
seven
of
yore
slumber
divine
will
steep
my
outworn
soul
and
every
stain
dissolve
to
the
very
core
she
too
will
slumber
having
found
her
goal
time
ocean
us
will
in
silence
frore
aeonian
tides
of
seasons
roll
and
our
long
dark
appointed
period
fill
then
shall
we
wake
together
loving
still
her
face
on
his
her
mouth
to
his
mouth
pressed
was
all
the
answer
of
the
trusting
maid
close
in
his
arms
he
held
her
to
his
breast
for
one
brief
moment
would
have
yet
assayed
some
deeper
word
her
heart
to
strengthen
lest
it
should
though
faithful
be
too
much
afraid
but
the
clock
gave
the
warning
to
the
hour
and
on
the
thatch
fell
sounds
not
of
a
shower
one
long
kiss
and
the
maiden
rose
a
fear
lay
thin
as
a
glassy
shadow
on
her
heart
she
trembled
as
some
unknown
thing
were
near
but
smiled
next
moment
for
they
should
not
part
the
youth
arose
with
cheer
he
helped
the
maid
whose
trembling
hands
did
thwart
her
haste
to
wrap
her
in
her
mantle
fold
then
out
they
passed
into
the
midnight
cold
the
moon
was
sinking
in
the
dim
green
west
curled
upward
to
the
horizon
brink
a
leaf
of
glory
falling
to
its
rest
the
maiden
hand
still
trembling
sought
to
link
her
arm
to
his
with
love
instinctive
quest
but
his
enfolded
her
hers
did
not
sink
but
thus
set
free
it
stole
his
body
round
and
so
they
walked
in
freedom
fetters
bound
pressed
to
his
side
she
felt
like
bell
a
mighty
heart
heave
large
in
measured
play
but
as
the
floating
moon
aye
lower
fell
its
bounding
force
did
by
slow
loss
decay
it
throbbed
now
like
a
bird
now
like
far
knell
pulsed
low
and
faint
and
now
with
sick
dismay
she
felt
the
arm
relax
that
round
her
clung
and
from
her
circling
arm
he
forward
hung
his
footsteps
feeble
short
his
paces
grow
her
strength
and
courage
mount
and
swell
amain
he
lifted
up
his
head
the
moon
lay
low
nigh
the
world
edge
his
lips
with
some
keen
pain
quivered
but
with
a
smile
his
eyes
turned
slow
seeking
in
hers
the
balsam
for
his
bane
and
finding
it
love
over
death
supreme
like
two
sad
souls
they
walked
met
in
one
dream
a
note
a
in
a
lovely
garden
walking
two
lovers
went
hand
in
hand
two
wan
worn
figures
talking
they
sat
in
the
flowery
land
on
the
cheek
they
kissed
one
another
on
the
mouth
with
sweet
refrain
fast
held
they
each
the
other
and
were
young
and
well
again
two
little
bells
rang
shrilly
the
dream
went
with
the
hour
she
lay
in
the
cloister
stilly
he
far
in
the
hanging
his
head
behind
each
came
a
hound
padding
with
gentle
paws
upon
the
road
straight
silent
pines
rose
here
and
there
around
a
dull
stream
on
the
left
side
hardly
flowed
a
black
snake
through
the
sluggish
waters
wound
hark
the
night
raven
see
the
crawling
toad
she
thinks
how
dark
will
be
the
moonless
night
how
feeblest
ray
is
yet
supernal
light
the
moon
last
gleam
fell
on
dim
glazed
eyes
a
body
shrunken
from
its
garments
fold
an
aged
man
whose
bent
knees
could
not
rise
he
tottered
in
the
maiden
tightening
hold
she
shivered
but
too
slight
was
the
disguise
to
hide
from
love
what
never
yet
was
old
she
held
him
fast
with
open
eyes
did
pray
walked
through
the
fear
and
kept
the
onward
way
toward
a
gloomy
thicket
of
tall
firs
dragging
his
steps
he
turned
aside
there
silence
sleeps
not
one
green
needle
stirs
they
enter
it
a
breeze
begins
to
chide
among
the
cones
it
swells
until
it
whirs
vibrating
so
each
sharp
leaf
that
it
sighed
the
grove
became
a
harp
of
mighty
chords
by
unseen
creatures
wild
for
words
but
when
he
turned
again
toward
the
cleft
of
a
great
rock
as
instantly
it
ceased
and
the
tall
pines
stood
sudden
as
if
reft
of
a
strong
passion
or
from
pain
released
again
they
wove
their
straight
dark
motionless
weft
across
the
and
west
and
east
rose
and
marched
up
cloudy
stairs
and
like
sad
thoughts
the
bats
came
unawares
was
a
drear
chamber
for
thy
bridal
night
o
poor
pale
saviour
bride
an
earthen
lamp
with
shaking
hands
he
kindled
whose
faint
light
mooned
out
a
tiny
halo
on
the
damp
that
filled
the
cavern
to
its
unseen
height
dim
glimmering
like
in
a
swamp
watching
the
entrance
each
side
lies
a
hound
with
liquid
light
his
red
eyes
gleaming
round
a
heap
rose
from
the
rocky
floor
of
moss
and
leaves
by
many
a
sunny
wind
long
tossed
and
dried
with
rich
furs
covered
expectant
up
a
jealous
glory
shined
in
her
possessing
heart
he
should
find
more
in
her
than
in
those
faithless
with
sweet
mind
she
praying
gently
did
herself
unclothe
and
lay
down
by
him
trusting
and
not
loath
once
more
a
wind
came
flapping
overhead
the
hounds
pricked
up
their
ears
their
eyes
flashed
fire
the
trembling
maiden
heard
a
sudden
tread
dull
yet
plain
dinted
on
the
windy
gyre
as
if
long
wet
feet
smooth
pavement
sped
come
fiercely
up
as
driven
by
longing
dire
to
enter
followed
sounds
of
hurried
rout
with
bristling
hair
the
hounds
stood
looking
out
then
came
half
querulous
a
whisper
old
feeble
and
hollow
as
if
shut
in
a
chest
take
my
face
on
your
bosom
i
am
cold
she
bared
her
holy
bosom
nest
and
forth
her
two
hands
instant
went
and
took
the
face
and
close
against
her
pressed
ah
the
dead
chill
was
that
the
feet
again
but
her
great
heart
kept
beating
for
the
twain
she
heard
the
wind
fall
heard
the
following
rain
swelling
the
silent
waters
till
their
sound
went
wallowing
through
the
night
along
the
plain
the
lamp
went
out
by
the
slow
darkness
drowned
must
the
fair
dawn
a
thousand
years
refrain
like
centuries
the
feeble
hours
went
round
eternal
night
entombed
her
with
decay
to
her
live
soul
she
clasped
the
breathless
clay
the
world
stood
still
her
life
sank
down
so
low
that
but
for
wretchedness
no
life
she
knew
a
charnel
wind
moaned
out
a
moaning
from
the
devouring
heart
of
earth
it
blew
fair
memories
lost
all
their
sunny
glow
out
of
the
dark
the
forms
of
old
friends
grew
but
so
transparent
blanched
with
dole
and
smart
she
saw
the
pale
worm
lying
in
each
heart
and
worst
of
all
oh
death
of
life
a
voice
within
her
woke
and
cried
in
sooth
vain
is
all
sorrow
hope
and
care
and
strife
love
and
its
beauty
its
tenderness
and
truth
are
shadows
bred
in
hearts
too
which
melt
and
pass
with
youth
regard
them
and
they
quiver
waver
blot
gaze
at
them
fixedly
and
they
are
not
and
all
the
answer
the
poor
child
could
make
was
in
the
tightened
clasp
of
arms
and
hands
hopeless
she
lay
like
one
death
would
not
take
but
still
kept
driving
from
his
empty
lands
yet
hopeless
held
she
out
for
his
dear
sake
the
darksome
horror
grew
like
drifting
sands
till
nought
was
precious
neither
god
nor
light
and
yet
she
braved
the
false
denying
night
so
dead
was
hope
that
when
a
glimmer
weak
stole
through
a
fissure
somewhere
in
the
cave
thinning
the
clotted
darkness
on
his
cheek
she
thought
her
own
tired
eyes
the
glimmer
gave
he
moved
his
head
she
saw
his
eyes
and
knew
that
death
was
dead
and
filled
the
grave
old
age
convicted
lie
had
fled
away
youth
youth
eternal
in
her
bosom
lay
with
a
low
cry
closer
to
him
she
crept
and
on
his
bosom
hid
a
face
that
glowed
it
was
his
turn
to
comfort
he
had
slept
oh
earth
and
sky
oh
ever
patient
god
she
had
not
yielded
but
the
truth
had
kept
new
love
new
bliss
in
weeping
overflowed
i
can
no
farther
tell
the
tale
begun
they
are
asleep
and
waiting
for
the
sun
lost
look
look
there
send
your
eyes
across
the
gray
by
my
away
through
the
vaporous
fumy
air
beyond
the
air
you
see
the
dark
beyond
the
dark
the
dawning
day
on
its
horizon
pray
you
mark
something
like
a
ruined
heap
of
worlds
that
go
back
down
all
the
grades
through
which
they
rose
up
to
harmonious
life
and
law
repose
back
slow
to
the
awful
deep
of
nothingness
mere
being
lack
on
its
surface
lone
and
bare
shapeless
as
a
dumb
despair
formless
nameless
something
lies
can
the
vision
in
your
eyes
its
idea
recognize
is
a
poor
lost
soul
alack
half
he
lived
some
ages
back
but
with
hardly
opened
eyes
thinking
him
already
wise
down
he
sat
and
wrote
a
book
drew
his
life
into
a
nook
out
of
it
would
not
arise
to
peruse
the
letters
dim
graven
dark
on
his
own
walls
those
he
judged
were
scrawls
or
at
best
no
use
to
him
a
lamp
was
there
for
reading
these
this
he
trimmed
sitting
at
ease
for
its
aid
to
write
his
book
never
at
his
walls
to
look
trimmed
and
trimmed
to
one
faint
spark
which
went
out
and
left
him
i
will
try
if
he
can
hear
spirit
words
with
spirit
ear
motionless
thing
who
once
like
him
who
cries
to
thee
hadst
thy
place
with
thy
shining
peers
thy
changeful
place
in
the
changeless
dance
issuing
ever
in
radiance
from
the
doors
of
the
far
eternity
with
feet
that
glitter
and
glide
and
glance
to
the
that
binds
the
free
and
sets
the
captive
at
liberty
to
the
clang
of
the
crystal
spheres
o
heart
for
love
o
thirst
to
drink
from
the
wells
that
feed
the
sea
o
hands
of
truth
a
human
link
mine
and
the
father
knee
o
eyes
to
see
o
soul
to
think
o
life
the
brother
of
me
has
infinitude
sucked
back
all
the
individual
life
it
gave
boots
it
nothing
to
cry
and
call
is
thy
form
an
empty
grave
it
heareth
not
brothers
the
terrible
thing
sounds
no
sense
to
its
ear

bring
let
us
away
is
no
use
to
tarry
love
no

not

forgotten
it
alas
lost
in
eternity
will
the
wind
of
his
breathing
never
pass
over
it
through
the
insensate
gloom
like
a
bud
on
a
tombstone
curled
crumbling

on
its
crumbling
world

and
deaf
with

vacuity

i

overweening
ambitious

of
pride
and
greed
let
me
wash
the
hoofs
let
me
be
the
thrall
jesus
of
thy
white
steed
golden
from
off
the
earth
the
vapours
curled
went
up
to
meet
their
joy
the
boy
awoke
and
all
the
world
was
waiting
for
the
boy
the
sky
the
water
the
wide
earth
was
full
of
windy
play
shining
and
fair
alive
with
mirth
all
for
his
holiday
the
hill
said
climb
me
and
the
wood
come
to
my
bosom
child
mine
is
a
merry
gamboling
brood
come
and
with
them
go
wild
the
shadows
with
the
sunlight
played
the
birds
were
singing
loud
the
hill
stood
up
with
pines
arrayed
he
ran
to
join
the
crowd
but
long
ere
noon
dark
grew
the
skies
pale
grew
the
shrinking
sun
how
soon
he
said
for
clouds
to
rise
when
day
was
but
begun
the
wind
grew
rough
a
wilful
power
it
swept
tree
and
town
the
boy
exulted
for
an
hour
then
weary
sat
him
down
and
as
he
sat
the
rain
began
and
rained
till
all
was
still
he
looked
and
saw
a
rainbow
span
the
vale
from
hill
to
hill
he
dried
his
tears
ah
now
he
said
the
storm
was
good
i
see
yon
hill
upon
its
head
i
find
the
golden
key
he
thrid
the
copse
he
climbed
the
fence
at
last
the
top
did
scale
but
lo
the
rainbow
vanished
thence
was
shining
in
the
vale
still
here
it
stood
yes
here
he
said
its
very
foot
was
set
i
saw
this
through
the
red
this
through
the
violet
he
searched
and
searched
while
down
the
skies
went
slow
the
slanting
sun
at
length
he
lifted
hopeless
eyes
and
day
was
nearly
done
beyond
the
vale
above
the
heath
high
flamed
the
crimson
west
his
mother
cottage
lay
beneath
the
rosy
breast
oh
joy
he
cried
not
the
way
farther
from
home
we
go
the
rain
will
come
another
day
and
bring
another
bow
long
ere
he
reached
his
mother
cot
still
tiring
more
and
more
the
red
was
all
one
cold
gray
blot
and
night
lay
round
the
door
but
when
his
mother
stroked
his
head
the
night
was
grim
in
vain
and
when
she
kissed
him
in
his
bed
the
rainbow
rose
again
soon
things
that
are
and
things
that
seem
did
mingle
merrily
he
dreamed
nor
was
it
all
a
dream
his
mother
had
the
key
a
microcosm
in
terza
rima
i
quiet
i
lay
at
last
and
knew
no
more
whether
i
breathed
or
not
so
worn
i
lay
with
the
what
was
yet
before
neither
i
met
nor
turned
from
it
away
my
only
conscious
being
was
the
rest
of
pain
gone
dead
dead
with
the
bygone
day
and
long
i
could
have
lingered
all
but
blest
in
that
but
there
came
a
sound
as
of
a
door
that
opened
in
the
west
somewhere
i
thought
it
as
the
hare
the
hound
the
noise
did
start
my
eyelids
and
they
rose
i
turned
my
eyes
and
looked
then
straight
i
found
it
was
my
that
did
unclose
for
a
tall
form
up
to
my
bedside
drew
grand
was
it
silent
its
very
walk
repose
and
when
i
saw
the
countenance
i
knew
that
i
was
lying
in
my
chamber
dead
for
this
my
brother
brothers
such
are
few
that
now
to
greet
me
bowed
his
kingly
head
had
many
years
agone
like
holy
dove
returning
from
his
friends
and
kindred
sped
and
leaving
memories
of
mournful
love
passed
vanishing
behind
the
unseen
veil
and
though
i
loved
him
all
high
words
above
not
for
his
loss
then
did
i
weep
or
wail
knowing
that
here
we
live
but
in
a
tent
and
seeking
home
shall
find
it
without
fail
feeble
but
eager
toward
him
my
hands
went
i
too
was
dead
so
might
the
dead
embrace
taking
me
by
the
shoulders
down
he
bent
and
lifted
me
i
was
in
sickly
case
but
growing
stronger
stood
up
on
the
floor
there
turned
and
once
regarded
my
dead
face
with
curious
eyes
its
brow
contentment
wore
but
i
had
done
with
it
and
turned
away
i
saw
my
brother
by
the
open
door
and
followed
him
out
into
the
night
the
houses
stood
up
hard
in
limpid
air
the
moon
hung
in
the
heavens
in
half
decay
and
all
the
world
to
my
bare
feet
lay
bare
ii
now
i
had
suffered
in
my
life
as
they
must
suffer
and
by
slow
years
younger
grow
from
whom
the
false
must
drop
away
compact
of
greed
and
fear
which
gathered
slow
darkens
the
that
evermore
where
no
vain
phantom
in
or
out
shall
go
moveless
beholds
the
father
stands
before
the
throne
of
revelation
waiting
there
with
wings
on
the
until
it
find
the
father
ideal
fair
and
be
itself
at
last
not
one
small
thorn
shall
needless
any
pilgrim
garments
tear
and
but
to
say
i
had
suffered
i
would
scorn
save
for
the
marvellous
thing
that
next
befell
sudden
i
grew
aware
i
was
all
pain
had
vanished
in
the
absorbent
swell
of
some
exalting
peace
that
was
my
own
as
the
moon
dwelt
in
heaven
did
calmness
dwell
at
home
in
me
essential
the
earth
moan
lay
all
behind
had
i
then
lost
my
part
in
human
griefs
dear
part
with
them
that
groan
is
weariness
i
said
but
with
a
start
that
set
it
trembling
and
yet
brake
it
not
i
found
the
peace
was
love
oh
my
rich
heart
for
every
time
i
spied
a
glimmering
spot
of
window
pane
there
in
that
silent
room
thought
i
mayhap
sleeps
human
heart
whose
lot
is
therefore
dear
to
mine
i
cared
for
whom
i
saw
not
had
not
seen
and
might
not
see
after
the
love
crept
prone
its
but
instant
a
mightier
love
arose
in
me
as
in
an
ocean
a
single
wave
will
swell
and
heaved
the
shadow
to
the
centre
we
had
called
it
prayer
before
on
sleep
i
fell
it
sank
and
left
my
sea
in
holy
calm
i
gave
each
man
to
god
and
all
was
well
and
in
my
heart
stirred
soft
a
sleeping
psalm
iii
no
gentlest
murmur
through
the
city
crept
not
one
lone
word
my
brother
to
me
had
spoken
but
when
beyond
the
we
stept
i
knew
the
hovering
silence
would
be
broken
a
low
night
wind
came
whispering
through
and
through
it
did
baptize
me
with
the
pledge
and
token
of
that
soft
which
blows
and
blew
and
fans
the
human
world
since
evermore
the
very
grass
cool
to
my
feet
i
knew
to
be
love
also
and
with
the
love
i
bore
to
hold
far
sympathy
silent
and
sweet
as
having
known
the
secret
from
of
yore
in
the
eternal
heart
where
all
things
meet
feelings
and
thinkings
and
where
still
they
are
bred
sudden
he
stood
and
with
arrested
feet
i
also
like
a
orb
his
head
slow
turned
the
bright
side
lo
the
that
ancient
human
glory
on
me
shed
clothéd
in
which
jesus
came
forth
to
wile
unto
his
bosom
every
labouring
soul
and
all
dividing
passions
to
beguile
to
winsome
death
and
then
on
them
to
roll
the
blessed
stone
of
the
holy
sepulchre
thank
god
he
said
thou
also
now
art
whole
and
sound
and
well
for
the
keen
pain
and
stir
uneasy
and
sore
grief
that
came
to
us
all
in
that
we
knew
not
how
the
wine
and
myrrh
could
ever
from
the
vinegar
and
gall
be
parted
are
deep
sunk
yea
drowned
in
god
and
yet
the
past
not
folded
in
a
pall
but
breathed
upon
like
aaron
withered
rod
by
a
sweet
light
that
brings
the
blossoms
through
showing
in
dreariest
paths
that
men
have
trod
another
spotted
of
crimson
hue
still
on
before
wherever
theirs
did
wend
yea
through
the
desert
leading
of
thyme
and
rue
the
desert
souls
in
which
young
lions
rend
and
roar
the
passionate
who
to
be
blest
ravin
as
bears
and
do
not
gain
their
end
because
that
save
in
god
there
is
no
rest
iv
something
my
brother
said
to
me
like
this
but
how
unlike
it
also
think
i
pray
his
eyes
were
music
and
his
smile
a
kiss
himself
the
word
his
speech
was
but
a
ray
in
the
clear
nimbus
that
with
verity
of
absolute
utterance
made
a
day
of
truth
about
him
lamping
solemnly
and
when
he
paused
there
came
a
swift
repose
too
high
too
still
to
be
called
ecstasy
a
purple
silence
lanced
through
in
the
close
by
such
keen
thought
that
with
a
sudden
smiling
it
grew
sheen
silver
hearted
with
burning
rose
he
was
a
glory
full
of
reconciling
of
faithfulness
of
love
with
no
of
tenderness
and
care
and
back
to
the
bosom
of
a
speechless
gain
i
can
not
tell
how
long
we
joyous
talked
for
from
my
sense
old
time
had
vanished
quite
space
for
onward
still
we
walked
no
sun
arose
to
blot
the
pale
still
night
still
as
the
night
of
some
great
spongy
stone
that
turns
but
once
an
age
betwixt
the
light
and
the
huge
shadow
from
its
own
bulk
thrown
and
long
as
that
to
me
before
whose
face
visions
so
many
slid
and
veils
were
blown
aside
from
the
vague
vast
of
isis
grace
innumerous
thoughts
yet
throng
that
infinite
hour
and
hopes
which
greater
hopes
unceasing
chase
for
i
was
all
responsive
to
his
power
i
saw
my
friends
weep
wept
and
let
them
weep
i
saw
the
growth
of
each
flower
i
saw
the
gardener
watching
in
their
sleep
wiping
their
tears
with
the
napkin
he
had
laid
wrapped
by
itself
when
he
climbed
hades
steep
what
wonder
then
i
saw
nor
was
dismayed
i
saw
the
dull
degraded
monsters
nursed
in
greedy
men
that
preyed
upon
the
helpless
ground
the
feeblest
worst
yea
all
the
human
chaos
wild
and
waste
where
he
who
will
not
leave
what
god
hath
cursed
now
fruitless
wallows
now
is
stung
and
chased
by
visions
lovely
and
by
longings
dire
but
who
believeth
he
shall
not
make
haste
even
passing
through
the
water
and
the
fire
or
sad
with
memories
of
a
better
lot
he
saved
by
hope
for
all
men
will
desire
knowing
that
god
into
a
may
shut
an
aeon
give
a
world
that
lay
wombed
in
its
sun
a
molten
unorbed
clot
one
moment
from
the
red
rim
to
spin
away
librating
ages
to
roll
on
weary
wheel
ere
it
turn
homeward
almost
spent
its
day
who
knows
love
all
time
nothing
he
shall
feel
no
anxious
heart
shall
lift
no
trembling
hand
tender
as
air
but
clothed
in
triple
steel
he
for
his
kind
in
every
age
and
land
hoping
will
live
and
to
his
labour
bent
the
father
will
shall
doing
understand
so
spake
my
brother
as
we
onward
went
his
words
my
heart
received
as
corn
the
lea
and
answered
with
a
harvest
of
content
we
came
at
last
upon
a
lonesome
sea
vi
and
onward
still
he
went
i
following
out
on
the
water
but
the
water
lo
like
a
thin
sheet
of
glass
lay
vanishing
the
starry
host
in
glorious
twofold
show
looked
up
looked
down
the
moment
i
saw
this
a
quivering
fear
thorough
my
heart
did
go
unstayed
i
walked
across
a
twin
abyss
a
hollow
sphere
of
blue
nor
floor
was
found
of
questing
eye
only
the
foot
met
the
kiss
of
the
cool
water
lightly
crisping
round
the
edges
of
the
footsteps
terror
froze
my
fallen
eyelids
but
again
the
sound
of
my
guide
voice
on
the
still
air
arose
hast
thou
forgotten
that
we
walk
by
faith
for
keenest
sight
but
multiplies
the
shows
lift
up
thine
eyelids
take
a
valiant
breath
terrified
dare
the
terror
in
god
name
step
wider
trust
the
invisible
can
death
avail
no
more
to
hearten
up
thy
flame
i
trembled
but
i
opened
wide
mine
eyes
and
strode
on
the
invisible
sea
the
same
high
moment
vanished
all
my
cowardice
and
god
was
with
me
the
stars
threw
quivering
smiles
across
the
gulfy
skies
the
white
aurora
flashed
great
scimitars
from
north
to
zenith
and
again
my
guide
full
turned
on
me
his
face
no
latticed
across
a
soul
i
there
descried
no
of
grief
quiet
brooded
upon
his
forehead
clear
and
wide
yet
from
that
face
a
pang
shot
vivid
and
strong
into
my
heart
for
though
i
saw
him
stand
close
to
me
in
the
void
as
one
in
a
throng
yet
on
the
border
of
some
nameless
land
he
stood
afar
a
mystery
caught
him
whole
worlds
away
though
in
my
hand
his
hand
i
held
and
gazing
earnestly
searched
in
his
countenance
as
in
a
mine
for
jewels
of
contentment
satisfy
my
heart
i
could
not
seeming
to
divine
my
hidden
trouble
gently
he
stooped
and
kissed
my
forehead
and
his
arms
did
round
me
twine
and
held
me
to
his
bosom
still
i
missed
that
ancient
earthly
nearness
when
we
shared
one
bed
like
birds
that
of
no
morrow
wist
roamed
our
one
father
farm
or
later
fared
along
the
dusty
highways
of
the
old
clime
backward
he
drew
and
as
if
he
had
bared
my
soul
stood
reading
there
a
little
time
while
in
his
eyes
tears
gathered
slow
like
dew
that
dims
the
grass
at
evening
or
at
prime
but
makes
the
stars
in
the
blue
and
on
his
lips
a
faint
ethereal
smile
hovered
as
hangs
the
mist
of
its
own
hue
trembling
about
a
purple
flower
the
while
evening
grows
brown
brother
brother
i
cried
but
straight
outbursting
tears
my
words
beguile
and
in
my
bosom
all
the
utterance
died
vii
a
moment
more
he
stood
then
softly
sighed
i
know
thy
pain
but
this
sorrow
is
far
beyond
my
help
his
voice
at
length
replied
to
my
beseeching
tears
look
at
yon
star
up
from
the
low
east
all
ablaze
thou
because
no
cloud
between
doth
mar
the
liquid
glory
that
from
its
visage
rays
thou
therefore
knowest
that
same
world
on
high
its
people
and
its
orders
and
its
ways
what
meanest
thou
i
said
thou
that
would
hold
not
thy
dear
form
but
the
thou
art
not
near
me
for
thyself
i
cry
not
the
less
near
that
nearer
i
shall
be
i
have
a
world
within
thou
dost
not
know
would
i
could
make
thee
know
it
but
all
of
me
is
thine
though
thou
not
yet
canst
enter
so
into
possession
that
betwixt
us
twain
the
frolic
homeliness
of
love
should
flow
as
the
brim
of
childhood
cup
again
away
the
deeper
childhood
first
must
wipe
that
clouded
consciousness
which
was
our
pain
when
in
thy
breast
the
godlike
hath
grown
ripe
and
thou
christ
little
one
art
ten
times
more
a
child
than
when
we
played
with
drum
and
pipe
about
our
earthly
father
happy
door
then
he
ceased
not
his
holy
utterance
still
flowing
went
on
like
spring
from
hidden
store
of
wasteless
waters
but
i
wept
my
fill
nor
heeded
much
the
comfort
of
his
speech
at
length
he
said
when
first
i
clomb
the
hill
with
earthly
words
i
heavenly
things
would
reach
where
dwelleth
now
the
man
we
used
to
call
father
whose
voice
oh
memory
dear
did
teach
us
in
our
beds
when
straight
as
once
a
stall
became
a
temple
holy
grew
the
room
prone
on
the
ground
before
him
i
did
fall
so
grand
he
towered
above
me
like
a
doom
but
now
i
look
into
the
face
fearless
yea
basking
blessed
in
the
bloom
of
his
eternal
youthfulness
and
grace
but
something
separates
us
yet
i
cried
let
light
at
least
begin
the
dark
to
chase
the
dark
begin
to
waver
and
divide
and
clear
the
path
of
vision
in
the
old
time
when
clouds
one
heart
did
from
the
other
hide
a
wind
would
blow
between
if
i
would
climb
this
foot
must
rise
ere
that
can
go
up
higher
some
big
a
teach
me
of
the
eternal
prime
he
answered
me
hearts
that
to
love
aspire
must
learn
its
mighty
harmony
ere
they
can
give
out
one
perfect
note
in
its
great
quire
and
thereto
am
i
sent
oh
sent
of
one
who
makes
the
dumb
for
joy
break
out
and
sing
he
opens
every
door
man
and
man
he
to
all
inner
chambers
all
will
bring
viii
it
was
enough
hope
waked
from
dreary
swound
and
hope
had
ever
been
enough
for
me
to
kennel
driving
grim
tomorrow
hound
from
chains
of
school
and
mode
she
set
me
free
and
urged
my
life
to
on
we
went
across
the
stars
that
underlay
the
sea
and
came
to
a
blown
shore
of
sand
and
bent
beyond
the
sand
a
marshy
moor
we
crossed
silent
i
for
i
pondered
what
he
meant
and
he
that
sacred
speech
might
not
be
lost
and
came
at
length
upon
an
evil
place
trees
lay
about
like
a
host
each
in
its
desolate
pool
some
fearful
race
of
creatures
was
not
far
for
howls
and
cries
and
gurgling
hisses
rose
with
even
pace
walking
fear
not
he
said
for
this
way
lies
our
journey
on
we
went
and
soon
the
ground
slow
from
the
waste
began
a
gentle
rise
and
tender
grass
in
patches
then
all
round
came
clouding
up
with
its
fresh
homely
tinge
of
softest
green
every
mound
at
length
of
lowly
shrubs
a
scattered
fringe
and
last
a
gloomy
forest
almost
blind
for
on
its
roof
no
did
impinge
so
that
its
very
leaves
did
share
the
mind
of
a
brown
shadowless
day
not
all
the
year
once
part
its
branches
to
let
through
a
wind
but
all
day
long
the
unmoving
trees
appear
to
ponder
on
the
past
as
men
may
do
that
for
the
future
wait
without
a
fear
and
in
the
past
the
coming
present
view
ix
i
know
not
if
for
days
many
or
few
pathless
we
thrid
the
wood
for
never
sun
its
windows
peeping
through
mottled
with
brighter
green
the
mosses
dun
or
meted
with
moving
shadows
time
the
shade
no
life
was
there
not
even
a
spider
spun
at
length
we
came
into
a
glade
an
open
level
in
a
circle
shut
by
solemn
trees
that
stood
aside
and
made
large
room
and
lonely
for
a
little
hut
by
grassy
sweeps
from
the
wood
was
built
of
saplings
old
that
had
been
cut
when
those
great
trees
no
larger
by
them
stood
thick
with
an
ancient
moss
it
seemed
to
have
grown
thus
from
the
old
brown
earth
a
covert
rude
up
to
its
low
door
my
brother
led
me
there
is
thy
first
school
he
said
there
be
thou
shown
thy
pictured
alphabet
wake
a
mind
of
prayer
and
praying
enter
but
wilt
thou
not
come
brother
i
said
no
said
he
and
i
where
then
shall
i
find
thee
thou
wilt
not
leave
me
dumb
and
a
whole
world
of
thoughts
unuttered
with
smile
and
dewy
eyes
and
some
conflicting
motions
of
his
kingly
head
he
pointed
to
the
door
i
entered
inward
lo
my
shadow
led
i
turned
his
countenance
shone
like
lightning
hoar
then
slow
he
turned
from
me
and
parted
slow
like
one
unwilling
whom
i
should
see
no
more
with
voice
nor
hand
said
i
must
go
but
drew
the
clinging
door
hard
to
the
post
no
dry
leaves
rustled
his
going
no
footfalls
came
back
from
the
departing
ghost
he
was
no
more
i
laid
me
down
and
wept
i
dared
not
follow
him
restrained
the
most
by
fear
i
should
not
see
him
if
i
leapt
out
after
him
with
cries
of
pleading
love
close
to
the
wall
in
hopeless
loss
i
crept
there
cool
sleep
came
god
shadow
from
above
i
woke
with
calmness
cleansed
and
sanctified
the
peace
that
filled
my
heart
of
old
when
i
woke
in
my
mother
lap
for
since
i
died
the
past
lay
bare
even
to
the
dreaming
shy
that
shadowed
my
yet
gathering
unborn
brain
and
marvelling
on
the
floor
i
saw
close
by
my
head
as
if
it
had
lain
beside
me
all
the
time
i
dreamless
lay
a
little
pool
of
sunlight
which
did
stain
the
earthen
brown
with
gold
marvelling
i
say
because
across
the
sea
and
through
the
wood
no
sun
had
shone
upon
me
all
the
way
i
rose
and
through
a
chink
the
glade
i
viewed
but
all
was
dull
as
it
had
always
been
and
sunless
every
round
it
stood
with
hardly
light
enough
to
show
it
green
yet
through
the
broken
roof
serenely
glad
by
a
rough
hole
entered
that
heavenly
sheen
then
i
remembered
in
old
years
i
had
seen
such
a
light
where
with
dropt
eyelids
gloomed
sitting
on
such
a
floor
dark
women
sad
in
a
low
house
where
lay
entombed
their
sires
and
children
only
there
the
door
was
open
to
the
sun
which
entering
plumed
with
shadowy
palms
the
stones
that
on
the
floor
stood
up
like
lidless
chests
again
to
find
that
the
soul
needs
no
brain
but
keeps
her
store
in
hidden
chambers
of
the
eternal
mind
thence
backward
ran
my
roused
memory
down
the
vista
back
to
blind
anticipations
while
my
soul
did
lie
closed
in
my
mother
forward
thence
through
bright
spring
morns
of
childhood
gay
with
hopes
that
fly
across
their
doming
blue
and
white
to
passionate
summer
noons
to
saddened
eves
of
autumn
rain
so
on
to
wintred
night
thence
up
once
more
to
the
dewy
dawn
that
weaves
saffron
and
gold
weaves
hope
with
still
content
and
wakes
the
worship
that
even
wrong
bereaves
of
half
its
pain
and
round
her
as
she
went
hovered
a
sense
as
of
an
odour
dear
whose
flower
was
far
as
of
a
letter
sent
not
yet
arrived
a
footstep
coming
near
but
oh
how
long
delayed
the
lifting
latch
as
of
a
waiting
sun
ready
to
peer
yet
peering
not
as
of
a
breathless
watch
over
a
sleeping
beauty
babbling
rime
about
her
lips
but
no
winged
word
to
catch
and
here
i
lay
the
child
of
changeful
time
shut
in
the
weary
changeless
evermore
a
dull
eternal
fadeless
fruitless
clime
was
this
the
dungeon
of
my
sinning
sore
a
gentle
hell
of
loneliness
foredoomed
for
such
as
i
whose
love
was
yet
the
core
of
all
my
being
the
brown
shadow
gloomed
persistent
faded
warm
no
ripple
ran
across
the
air
no
roaming
insect
boomed
alas
i
cried
i
am
no
living
man
better
were
darkness
and
the
leave
to
grope
than
light
that
builds
its
own
drear
prison
can
this
be
the
folding
of
the
wings
of
hope
xi
that
instant
through
the
branches
overhead
no
sound
of
going
went
a
shadow
fell
isled
in
the
unrippled
pool
of
sunlight
fed
from
some
far
fountain
hid
in
heavenly
dell
i
looked
and
in
the
low
roofs
broken
place
a
single
snowdrop
stood
a
radiant
bell
of
silvery
shine
softly
subdued
by
grace
of
delicate
green
that
made
the
white
appear
yet
whiter
blind
it
bowed
its
head
a
space
then
as
in
despite
of
fear
unfolded
its
three
rays
if
it
had
swung
its
pendent
bell
and
music
golden
clear
division
just
entrancing
sounds
among
had
flickered
down
as
tender
as
flakes
of
snow
it
had
not
shed
more
influence
as
it
rung
than
from
its
look
alone
did
rain
and
flow
i
knew
the
flower
perceived
its
human
ways
dim
saw
the
secret
that
had
made
it
grow
my
heart
supplied
the
music
golden
phrase
light
from
the
dark
and
snowdrops
from
the
earth
life
resurrection
out
of
gross
decays
the
endless
round
of
beauty
yearly
birth
and
nations
rise
and
fall
were
in
the
flower
and
read
themselves
in
silence
heavenly
mirth
awoke
in
my
sad
heart
for
one
whole
hour
i
praised
the
god
of
snowdrops
but
at
height
the
bliss
gave
way
next
faith
began
to
cower
and
then
the
snowdrop
vanished
from
my
sight
xii
last
i
began
in
unbelief
to
say
no
angel
this
a
snowdrop
nothing
more
a
trifle
which
god
hands
drew
forth
in
play
from
the
tangled
pond
of
chaos
dank
and
frore
threw
on
the
bank
and
left
blindly
to
breed
a
wilful
fancy
would
have
gathered
store
of
evanescence
from
the
pretty
weed
white
shapely
then
divine
conclusion
lame
into
the
shelter
of
a
creed
not
out
of
god
but
nothingness
it
came
colourless
feeble
flying
from
life
heat
it
has
no
honour
hardly
shunning
shame
when
see
another
shadow
at
my
feet
hopeless
i
lifted
now
my
weary
head
why
mock
me
with
another
heavenly
cheat
a
primrose
fair
from
its
bed
laughed
lo
my
unbelief
to
heavenly
scorn
a
just
awake
no
prayer
yet
said
half
rising
from
the
couch
where
it
was
born
and
smiling
to
the
world
i
breathed
again
out
of
the
midnight
once
more
dawned
the
morn
and
fled
the
phantom
doubt
with
all
his
train
xiii
i
was
a
child
once
more
nor
pondered
life
thought
not
of
what
or
how
much
all
my
soul
with
sudden
births
of
lovely
things
grew
rife
in
peeps
a
daisy
on
the
instant
roll
rich
lawny
fields
with
red
tips
crowding
the
green
across
the
hollows
over
ridge
and
knoll
to
where
the
rosy
sun
goes
down
serene
from
out
of
heaven
in
looks
a
pimpernel
i
walk
in
morning
scents
of
thyme
and
bean
dewdrops
on
every
stalk
and
bud
and
bell
flash
like
a
many
roods
glow
ruby
suns
which
emerald
suns
would
quell
topaz
sapphire
beatitudes
blaze
in
the
slanting
sunshine
all
around
above
the
fields
and
woods
with
his
five
eggs
on
the
ground
the
sacrifice
bore
through
the
veil
of
light
odour
and
colour
offering
up
in
filled
thus
with
forms
of
lowly
might
and
shapeful
silences
of
lovely
lore
i
sat
a
child
happy
with
only
sight
and
for
a
time
i
needed
nothing
more
xiv
supine
to
the
revelation
i
did
lie
passive
as
prophet
to
his
dreaming
deep
or
harp
aeolian
to
the
breathing
sky
and
blest
as
any
child
whom
twilight
sleep
holds
half
and
half
lets
go
but
the
new
day
of
higher
need
with
sudden
leap
ah
flowers
i
said
ye
are
divinely
gay
but
your
fair
music
is
too
far
and
fine
ye
are
full
cups
yet
reach
not
to
allay
the
drought
of
those
for
human
love
who
pine
as
the
hart
for
at
once
a
face
was
looking
in
my
face
its
eyes
through
mine
were
feeding
me
with
tenderness
and
grace
and
by
their
love
i
knew
my
mother
eyes
gazing
in
them
there
grew
in
me
apace
a
longing
grief
and
love
did
swell
and
rise
till
weeping
i
brake
out
and
did
bemoan
my
blameful
share
in
bygone
tears
and
cries
o
mother
wilt
thou
plead
for
me
i
groan
i
say
not
plead
with
christ
but
plead
with
those
who
gathered
now
in
peace
about
his
throne
were
near
me
when
my
heart
was
full
of
throes
and
longings
vain
alter
a
flying
bliss
which
oft
the
fountain
by
the
threshold
froze
they
must
forgive
me
mother
tell
them
this
no
more
shall
swell
the
sigh
down
at
their
feet
i
lay
my
selfishness
the
face
grew
passionate
at
this
my
cry
the
gathering
tears
up
to
its
eyebrims
rose
it
grew
a
trembling
mist
that
did
not
fly
but
slow
dissolved
i
wept
as
one
of
those
who
wake
outside
the
garden
of
their
dream
and
lo
the
hours
laborious
close
its
opal
gates
with
stone
and
stake
and
beam
xv
but
glory
went
that
glory
more
might
come
behold
a
countless
multitude
no
less
a
host
of
faces
me
besieging
dumb
in
the
lone
castle
of
my
mournfulness
had
then
my
mother
given
the
word
i
sent
gathering
my
dear
ones
from
the
shining
press
and
had
these
others
their
lent
for
full
assurance
of
the
pardon
prayed
would
they
concentre
love
with
sweet
intent
on
my
to
blast
the
evil
shade
ah
perfect
vision
pledge
of
endless
hope
oh
army
of
the
holy
spirit
arrayed
in
comfort
panoply
for
words
i
grope
for
clouds
to
catch
your
radiant
dawn
my
own
and
tell
your
coming
from
the
highest
cope
of
blue
down
to
my
came
a
cone
of
faces
and
their
eyes
on
love
will
borne
bright
heads
like
the
forward
blown
heavy
with
ripeness
golden
ears
of
corn
by
gentle
wind
on
crowded
all
gazing
toward
my
forlorn
as
if
with
power
of
eyes
they
would
have
healed
my
troubled
heart
making
it
like
their
own
in
which
the
bitter
fountain
had
been
sealed
and
the
water
flowed
alone
xvi
with
what
i
thus
beheld
glorified
then
god
let
me
love
my
fill
and
pass
i
sighed
and
dead
for
love
had
almost
died
again
o
fathers
brothers
i
am
yours
i
cried
o
mothers
sisters
i
am
nothing
now
save
as
i
am
yours
and
in
you
sanctified
o
men
o
women
of
the
peaceful
brow
and
infinite
abysses
in
the
eyes
whence
god
ineffable
gazes
on
me
how
care
ye
for
me
impassioned
and
unwise
oh
ever
draw
my
heart
out
after
you
ever
o
grandeur
thus
before
me
rise
and
i
need
nothing
not
even
for
love
will
sue
i
am
no
more
and
love
is
all
in
all
henceforth
there
is
there
can
be
nothing
new
all
things
are
always
new
then
like
the
fall
of
a
steep
avalanche
my
joy
fell
steep
up
in
my
spirit
rose
as
it
were
the
call
of
an
old
sorrow
from
an
ancient
deep
for
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
eyes
of
him
whom
i
had
loved
before
i
learned
to
creep
god
vicar
in
his
twilight
nursery
dim
to
gather
us
to
the
higher
father
knee
i
saw
a
something
fill
their
azure
rim
that
caught
him
worlds
and
years
away
from
me
and
like
a
javelin
once
more
through
me
passed
the
pang
that
pierced
me
walking
on
the
sea
o
saints
i
cried
must
loss
be
still
the
last
xvii
when
i
said
this
the
cloud
of
witnesses
turned
their
heads
sideways
and
the
cloud
grew
dim
i
saw
their
faces
half
but
now
their
bliss
gleamed
low
like
the
old
moon
in
the
new
moon
rim
then
as
i
gazed
a
better
kind
of
light
on
every
outline
to
glimmer
and
swim
faint
as
the
young
moon
threadlike
on
the
night
just
born
of
sunbeams
trembling
on
her
edge
was
a
great
cluster
of
profiles
in
sharp
white
had
some
far
dawn
begun
to
drive
a
wedge
into
the
night
and
cleave
the
clinging
dark
i
saw
no
moon
or
star
token
or
pledge
of
light
save
that
manifold
silvery
mark
the
shining
title
of
each
whence
came
that
light
sudden
as
if
a
spark
of
vital
touch
had
found
some
hidden
nook
where
germs
of
potent
harmonies
lay
prest
and
their
outbursting
life
old
aether
shook
rose
as
in
prayer
to
lingering
promised
guest
from
that
great
cone
of
faces
such
a
song
instinct
with
hope
harmonical
unrest
that
with
sore
weeping
and
the
cry
how
long
i
bore
my
part
because
i
could
not
sing
and
as
they
sang
the
light
more
clear
and
strong
bordered
their
faces
till
the
i
could
almost
no
more
encounter
and
bear
light
from
their
eyes
like
water
from
a
spring
flowed
on
their
foreheads
reigned
their
flashing
hair
i
saw
the
light
from
eyes
i
could
not
see
he
comes
he
comes
they
sang
comes
to
our
prayer
oh
my
poor
heart
if
only
it
were
i
cried
thereat
the
faces
moved
those
eyes
were
turning
on
me
in
rushed
ecstasy
and
woke
me
to
the
light
of
lower
skies
xviii
what
matter
said
i
whether
clank
of
chain
or
wakes
up
to
bitterness
stung
with
its
loss
i
called
the
vision
vain
yet
feeling
life
grown
larger
suffering
less
sleep
ashes
from
my
eyelids
i
did
brush
the
room
was
veiled
that
morning
should
not
press
upon
the
slumber
which
had
stayed
the
rush
of
ebbing
life
i
looked
into
the
gloom
upon
her
brow
the
dawn
first
grayest
flush
and
on
her
cheek
pale
hope
reviving
bloom
sat
patient
watcher
darkling
and
alone
she
who
had
lifted
me
from
many
a
tomb
one
then
was
left
me
of
love
radiant
cone
its
light
on
her
dear
face
though
faint
and
wan
was
shining
yet
a
dawn
upon
it
thrown
from
the
far
coming
of
the
son
of
man

in
every
forehead

i
see
a
sky
catching
the
dawn
i
hear
the
wintriest
breeze
about
me
blow
the
news
the
lord
is
nigh

lord
i
have
spoken
a
poor
parable
in
which
i
would
have
said
thy
name
alone
is
the
one
secret
lying
in
truth
well
thy
voice
the
hidden
charm
in
every
tone
thy
face
the
heart
of
every
flower
on
earth
its
vision
the
one
hope
for
every
moan
thy
love
the
cure
o
sharer
of
the
birth
of
little
children
seated
on
thy
knee
o
human
god
i
laugh
with
sacred
mirth
to
think
how
all
the
laden
shall
go
free
for
though
the
vision
tarry
in
healing
ruth
one
morn
the
eyes
that
shone
in
galilee
will
dawn
upon
them
full
of
grace
and
truth
and
thy
own
love
the
vivifying
core
of
every
love
in

every
hope

plunged
into

lies
there
lovely
with

and
a

brook
that
says
care

i
drown
you
by

what
comes
next
a
little
town
and
a
towering
hill
again
more
hills
and

up

down
and
a
river
now
and
then
and
what
comes
next
a
lonely
moor
without
one
beaten
way
and
slow
clouds
drifting
dull
before
a
wind
that
will
not
stay
and
then
dark
rocks
and
yellow
sand
blue
sea
and
a
moaning
tide
and
then
more
sea
and

with

deep

wide
and

oh
rock
and
mountain
and
vale
ocean
and
shores
and
men
over

over
a

you
the
best
i
have
not
told
you
the
end
if
you
want
to
escape
away
in
the
west
you
will
see
a
stair
ascend
built
of
all
colours
of
lovely
stones
a
stair
up
into
the
sky
where
no
one
is
weary
and
no
one
moans
or
wishes
to
be
laid
by
is
it
far
away
i
do
not
know
you
must
fix
your
eyes
thereon
and
travel
travel
through
thunder
and
snow
till
the
weary
way
is
gone
all
day
though
you
never
see
it
shine
you
must
travel
nor
turn
aside
all
night
you
must
keep
as
straight
a
line
through
moonbeams
or
darkness
wide
when
i
am
older
nay
not
so
i
have
hardly
opened
my
eyes
he
who
to
the
old
sunset
would
go
starts
best
with
the
young
sunrise
is
the
stair
right
up
is
it
very
steep
too
steep
for
you
to
climb
you
must
lie
at
the
foot
of
the
glorious
heap
and
patient
wait
your
time
how
long
nay
that
i
can
not
tell
in
wind
and
rain
and
frost
it
may
be
so
and
it
is
well
that
you
should
count
the
cost
pilgrims
from
near
and
from
distant
lands
will
step
on
you
lying
there
but
a
wayfaring
man
with
wounded
hands
will
carry
you
up
the
stair

thanks
dear

that

all
if
thy

one
day
should
need
some
words
to
make
it
good
i
am
ready
to
thy
call
an
old
the
monk
was
praying
in
his
cell
with
bowed
head
praying
sore
he
had
been
praying
on
his
knees
for
two
long
hours
and
more
as
of
themselves
all
suddenly
his
eyelids
opened
wide
before
him
on
the
ground
he
saw
a
man
feet
close
beside
and
almost
to
the
feet
came
down
a
garment
wove
throughout
such
garment
he
had
never
seen
in
countries
round
about
his
eyes
he
lifted
tremblingly
until
a
hand
they
spied
a
on
it
he
saw
and
a
deep
torn
scar
beside
his
eyes
they
leaped
up
to
the
face
his
heart
gave
one
wild
bound
then
stood
as
if
its
work
were
done
the
master
he
had
found
with
sudden
clang
the
convent
bell
told
him
the
poor
did
wait
his
hand
to
give
the
daily
bread
doled
at
the
then
love
rose
in
him
passionate
and
with
duty
wrestled
strong
and
the
bell
kept
calling
all
the
time
with
merciless
iron
tongue
the
master
stood
and
looked
at
him
he
rose
up
with
a
sigh
he
will
be
gone
when
i
come
back
i
go
to
him
by
and
by
he
chid
his
heart
he
fed
the
poor
all
at
the
then
with
feet
went
back
to
his
cell
so
desolate
his
heart
bereaved
by
duty
done
he
had
sore
need
of
prayer
oh
sad
he
lifted
the
latch
and
lo
the
master
standing
there
he
said
my
poor
had
not
to
stand
wearily
at
thy
gate
for
him
who
feeds
the
shepherd
sheep
the
shepherd
will
stand
and
wait
lord
for
thou
have
us
judge
and
i
will
humbly
dare
if
he
had
staid
i
do
not
think
thou
wouldst
have
left
him
there

voice
in
time

with
sweet
defending

the
poor

you

to
fetch
some
water

drew
a
full
pitcher
from
the
well
but
as
he
raised
it
to
his

the
water
lipping
with
the
rim
the
handle
broke
and
all
was
shed
upon
the
stones
about
the
brim

cloak
upon
the
ground
he
laid
and
in
it
gathered
up

pool

there
the

and
home
he
bore
it
eligius

fabled
ill

that
all
the

had
here
been
room
for
miracle
had
made
his

whole
still
some
few
drops
for
thirsty

a
poor

even
when
told
in
love
of
thee
the

indeed
like
broken

yet
may
hold
thy
truth
alas
lord
once
i
spilt
i
thought
to
bear
the
pitcher
high
upon
the
shining
stones
of
guilt
i
slipped
and
there
the
potsherds
lie
master
i
cried
man

no
human
thirst
will
be
stilled
through
me
who
sit
upon
the
brink
my
pitcher
broke
thy
water
spilled
what
will
they
do
i
waiting
left
they
looked
to
me
to
bring
thy
law
the
well
is
deep
and
i
nothing
have
wherewith
to
draw
but
as
i
sat
in
evil
plight
with
dry
parched
heart
and
sickened
brain
uprose
in
me
the
water
bright
thou
gavest
me
thyself
again
early
a
little
bird
sat
on
the
edge
of
her
nest
her
slept
as
sound
as
tops
she
had
worked
almost
without
rest
and
had
filled
every
one
of
their
gibbous
crops
her
own
she
had
filled
just
and
she
felt
like
a
dead
bird
stuffed
with
wool
oh
dear
she
sighed
as
she
sat
with
her
head
sunk
in
her
chest
and
no
neck
at
all
looking
like
an
apple
on
a
poked
and
rounded
and
fluffed
to
a
ball
what
to
be
done
if
things
do
reform
i
can
not
tell
where
there
is
one
more
worm
i
had
fifteen
and
the
children
five
each
besides
a
few
flies
and
some
very
fat
spiders
who
will
dare
say
i
do
do
as
i
preach
i
set
an
example
to
all
providers
but
what
the
use
we
want
a
storm
i
do
know
where
there
a
single
worm
there
five
in
my
crop
chirped
a
wee
wee
bird
who
woke
at
the
voice
of
his
mother
pain
i
know
where
there
five
and
with
the
word
he
tucked
in
his
head
and
went
off
again
the
folly
of
childhood
sighed
his
mother
has
always
been
my
especial
bother
careless
the
slept
on
they
never
had
heard
of
the
bogy
tomorrow
the
mother
sat
outside
making
her
moan
i
shall
soon
have
to
beg
or
steal
or
borrow
i
have
always
to
say
the
night
before
where
shall
i
find
one
red
worm
more
her
case
was
this
she
had
gobbled
too
many
and
sleepless
had
an
attack
she
called
foresight
a
barn
of
crumbs
if
she
knew
but
of
any
could
she
but
get
of
the
great
sight
the
eastern
sky
was
growing
red
ere
she
laid
her
wise
beak
in
its
just
then
the
fellow
who
knew
of
five
nor
troubled
his
sleep
with
anxious
tricks
woke
and
stirred
and
felt
alive
he
said
i
am
up
to
six
but
my
mother
feels
in
her
lot
the
crook
what
if
i
tried
my
own
little
hook
when
his
mother
awoke
she
winked
her
eyes
as
if
she
had
dreamed
that
she
was
a
mole
could
she
believe
them
what
a
huge
prize
that
child
is
dragging
out
of
its
hole
the
fledgeling
indeed
had
just
caught
his
third
here
is
a
fable
to
catch
the
bird
lark
and
king
good
morrow
my
lord
in
the
sky
alone
sang
the
lark
as
the
sun
ascended
his
throne
shine
on
me
my
lord
i
only
am
come
of
all
your
servants
to
welcome
you
home
i
have
shot
straight
up
a
whole
hour
i
swear
to
catch
the
first
gleam
of
your
golden
hair
must
i
thank
you
then
said
the
king
sir
lark
for
flying
so
high
and
hating
the
dark
you
ask
a
full
cup
for
half
a
thirst
half
was
love
of
me
half
love
to
be
first
some
of
my
subjects
serve
better
my
taste
their
watching
and
waiting
means
more
than
your
haste
king
sun
wrapt
his
head
in
a
turban
of
cloud
sir
lark
stopped
singing
quite
vexed
and
cowed
but
higher
he
flew
for
he
thought
anon
the
wrath
of
the
king
will
be
over
and
gone
and
scattering
his
manifold
he
will
change
my
brown
feathers
to
a
glory
of
gold
he
flew
with
the
strength
of
a
lark
he
flew
but
as
he
rose
the
cloud
rose
too
and
not
one
gleam
of
the
flashing
hair
brought
signal
of
favour
across
the
air
and
his
wings
felt
withered
and
worn
and
old
for
their
feathers
had
had
no
chrism
of
gold
outwearied
at
length
and
throbbing
sore
the
strong
could
do
no
more
he
faltered
and
sank
then
dropped
like
a
stone
beside
his
nest
where
patient
alone
sat
his
little
wife
on
her
little
eggs
keeping
them
warm
with
wings
and
legs
did
i
say
alone
ah
no
such
thing
there
was
the
cloudless
the
king
welcome
sir
lark
you
look
tired
said
he
is
not
always
the
best
way
to
me
while
you
have
been
racing
my
turban
gray
i
have
been
shining
where
you
would
not
stay
he
had
set
a
coronet
round
the
nest
its
radiance
foamed
on
the
wife
little
breast
and
so
glorious
was
she
in
russet
gold
that
sir
lark
for
wonder
and
awe
grew
cold
he
popped
his
head
under
her
wing
and
lay
as
still
as
a
stone
till
king
sun
went
away
owl
and
the
bim
bang
bome
sang
the
bell
to
himself
in
his
house
at
home
high
in
the
lone
and
unseen
in
a
twilight
of
ivy
cool
and
green
with
his
bing
bim
bing
bang
bome
singing
bass
to
himself
in
his
house
at
home
said
the
owl
on
a
shadowy
ledge
below
like
a
glimmering
ball
of
forgotten
snow
pest
on
that
fellow
sitting
up
there
always
calling
the
people
to
prayer
he
shatters
my
nerves
with
his
bang
bome
far
too
big
in
his
house
at
home
i
think
i
will
but
it
suits
me
well
and
one
may
get
used
to
it
who
can
tell
so
he
slept
again
with
all
his
might
then
woke
and
snooved
out
in
the
hush
of
night
when
the
bell
was
asleep
in
his
house
at
home
dreaming
over
his
bang
bome
for
the
owl
was
born
so
poor
and
genteel
what
could
he
do
but
pick
and
steal
he
scorned
to
work
for
honest
bread
better
have
never
been
hatched
he
said
so
his
day
was
the
night
for
he
dared
not
roam
till
sleep
had
silenced
the
bang
bome
when
five
greedy
owlets
chipped
the
egg
he
wanted
two
beaks
and
another
leg
and
they
ate
the
more
that
they
did
not
sleep
well
it
their
gizzards
said
owless
said
owl
it
that
bell
for
they
quivered
like
leaves
of
a
tome
when
the
bell
bellowed
out
his
bang
bome
but
the
bell
began
to
throb
with
the
fear
of
bringing
his
house
about
his
one
ear
and
his
people
came
round
it
quite
a
throng
to
buttress
the
walls
and
make
them
strong
a
full
month
he
sat
and
felt
like
a
mome
not
daring
to
shout
his
bang
bome
said
the
owl
to
himself
and
hissed
as
he
said
i
trust
in
my
heart
the
old
fool
is
dead
no
more
will
he
scare
with
his
bounce
and
make
them
so
thin
they
scarce
worth
a
pounce
once
i
will
see
him
ere
he
laid
in
the
loam
and
shout
in
his
ear
bim
bang
bome
hoo
hoo
he
cried
as
he
entered
the
steeple
they
hanged
him
at
last
the
righteous
people
his
swollen
tongue
lolls
out
of
his
head
hoo
hoo
at
last
the
old
brute
is
dead
there
let
him
hang
the
shapeless
gnome
choked
with
a
throatful
of
bang
bome
he
fluttered
about
him
singing
he
flapped
the
poor
bell
and
said
is
that
you
you
that
never
would
matters
mince
banging
poor
owls
and
making
them
wince
a
fig
for
you
now
in
your
great
is
better
than
bang
bome
still
braver
he
grew
the
downy
the
dapper
he
flew
in
and
perched
on
the
knob
of
the
clapper
and
shouted
an
echo
awoke
like
a
ghostly
stroke
just
so
he
cried
i
am
quite
at
home
i
will
take
his
place
with
my
bang
bome
he
hissed
with
the
scorn
of
his
grand
and
thought
the
bell
tremble
his
own
great
thunder
he
sat
the
jove
of
creation
went
the
bell
through
the
the
owl
a
fluffy
avalanche
light
as
foam
loosed
by
the
boom
of
the
bang
bome
he
sat
where
he
fell
as
if
he
had
meant
it
ready
for
any
remark
anent
it
said
the
eldest
owlet
pa
you
were
wrong
he
at
it
again
with
his
vulgar
song
child
said
the
owl
of
the
mark
you
are
wide
i
brought
him
to
life
by
perching
inside
why
did
you
my
dear
said
his
startled
wife
he
has
always
been
the
plague
of
your
life
i
have
given
him
a
lesson
of
good
for
evil
perhaps
the
old
ruffian
will
now
be
civil
the
owl
sat
righteous
he
raised
his
comb
the
bell
bawled
on
bim
bang
bome
a
the
croak
of
a
raven
hoar
a
dog
howl
loud
shuts
the
the
two
are
away
on
their
ghastly
ride
to
death
salt
shore
where
are
the
love
and
the
grace
the
bridegroom
is
thirsty
and
cold
the
bride
skull
sharpens
her
face
but
the
coachman
is
driving
jubilant
bold
the
devil
pace
the
horses
shivered
and
shook
waiting
gaunt
and
haggard
with
sorry
and
evil
look
but
swift
as
a
drunken
wind
they
staggered
lethe
brook
long
since
they
ran
no
more
heavily
pulling
they
died
on
the
sand
of
the
hopeless
shore
where
never
swelled
or
sank
a
tide
and
the
salt
burns
sore
flat
their
skeletons
lie
white
shadows
on
shining
sand
the
crusted
reins
go
high
to
the
crumbling
coachman
bony
hand
on
his
knees
awry
side
by
side
jarring
no
more
day
and
night
side
by
side
each
by
a
doorless
door
motionless
sit
the
bridegroom
and
bride
on
the
song
in
the
a
brown
bird
sang
on
a
blossomy
tree
sang
in
the
moonshine
merrily
three
little
songs
one
two
and
three
a
song
for
his
wife
for
himself
and
me
he
sang
for
his
wife
sang
low
sang
high
filling
the
moonlight
that
filled
the
sky
thee
thee
i
love
thee
heart
alive
thee
thee
thee
and
thy
round
eggs
five
he
sang
to
himself
what
shall
i
do
with
this
life
that
thrills
me
through
and
through
glad
is
so
glad
that
it
turns
to
ache
out
with
it
song
or
my
heart
will
break
he
sang
to
me
man
do
not
fear
though
the
moon
goes
down
and
the
dark
is
near
listen
my
song
and
rest
thine
eyes
let
the
moon
go
down
that
the
sun
may
rise
i
folded
me
up
in
the
heart
of
his
tune
and
fell
asleep
with
the
sinking
moon
i
woke
with
the
day
first
golden
gleam
and
lo
i
had
dreamed
a
precious
dream
love
the
baby
crept
abroad
to
pluck
a
flower
one
said
yes
sir
one
said
maybe
one
said
wait
the
hour
love
the
boy
joined
the
youngsters
at
their
play
but
they
gave
him
little
joy
and
he
went
away
love
the
youth
roamed
the
country
from
him
fled
away
in
sooth
many
a
man
and
maiden
love
the
man
sought
a
service
all
about
but
they
called
him
feeble
one
they
could
do
without
love
the
aged
walking
bowed
the
shadeless
miles
read
a
volume
full
of
tears
and
smiles
love
the
weary
tottered
down
the
shelving
road
at
its
foot
lo
night
the
starry
meeting
him
from
god
love
the
holy
sang
a
music
in
her
dome
sang
it
softly
sang
it
slowly
love
is
coming
home
the
lark
and
the
wind
in
the
air
why
such
a
ringing
on
the
earth
why
such
a
droning
in
the
air
the
lark
is
singing
on
the
earth
the
wind
is
moaning
i
am
blest
in
sunlight
swinging
sad
am
i
the
world
lies
groaning
in
the
sky
the
lark
kept
singing
on
the
earth
the
wind
kept
moaning
a
dead
house
when
the
clock
hath
ceased
to
tick
in
the
gloomy
hall
when
the
latch
no
more
doth
click
in
the
red
when
no
more
come
sounds
of
play
mice
nor
children
romping
roam
then
looks
down
the
eye
of
day
on
a
dead
house
not
a
home
but
when
like
an
old
sun
ghost
haunts
her
vault
the
spectral
moon
when
earth
margins
all
are
lost
melting
shapes
nigh
merged
in
swoon
then
a
sound
hark
there
again
no
is
not
a
nibbling
mouse
is
a
ghost
unseen
of
men
walking
through
the
house
and
with
lightning
on
the
stair
to
that
silent
upper
room
with
the
air
sudden
gleaming
into
gloom
with
a
whistling
round
from
the
raging
northern
coasts
then
mid
sieging
light
and
sound
all
the
house
is
live
with
ghosts
brother
is
thy
soul
a
cell
empty
save
of
glittering
motes
where
no
live
loves
live
and
dwell
only
notions
things
and
thoughts
then
thou
wilt
when
comes
a
breath
ridge
and
post
find
thyself
alone
with
death
in
a
house
where
walks
no
ghost
upon
organ
it
all
very
well
said
the
bell
to
be
the
big
organ
below
but
the
folk
come
and
go
said
the
bell
and
you
never
can
tell
what
sort
of
person
the
organ
will
blow
and
besides
it
is
much
at
the
mercy
of
the
weather
for
is
all
made
in
pieces
and
glued
together
but
up
in
my
cell
next
door
to
the
sky
said
the
bell
i
dwell
very
high
and
with
glorious
go
i
swing
to
and
fro
i
swing
swift
or
slow
i
swing
as
i
please
with
summons
or
knell
i
swing
at
my
ease
said
the
bell
not
the
tallest
of
men
can
reach
up
to
touch
me
to
smirch
me
or
smutch
me
or
make
me
do
what
i
would
not
be
at
and
then
the
weather
ca
cause
me
to
shrink
or
increase
i
chose
to
be
made
in
one
perfect
piece
master
and
boy
who
is
this
little
one
lying
said
time
at
my
moaning
and
sobbing
and
crying
out
in
the
cold
so
late
they
lurked
until
we
came
near
master
and
i
the
child
said
then
caught
me
with
happy
year

my
master
on
the
meadow
a
mile
away

make
me
run
faster
i
the
shadow
of

my
child
still
he
in
sight
only
look
well
to
his
track
little
shadow
run
like
the
light
he
misses
you
at
his
back
old
time
sat
down
in
the
sun
on
a
his
legs
were
numb
when
the
boy
to
his
master
has
run

said

flaming

of
a
dim
wide
stair
swing

its
pendulum
goes

swang
here
there
its
tick
and
its

like
the
blows
of
tubal

but
they
strike
on
the
anvil
of
never
an
ear
on
the
heart
of

they
fall
with
an
echo
of

together
joined
in

with

of
spheric
thunder
two
hands
in

spread
half

an
empty
gulf
of
longing
embrace
two
hands
wide
apart
as
they
can
fare
in

still
coasting
not

despair
but
turning
again
ever
round
to
prayer
two

human

with
awful
motion
from

ever
with

golden
cock
with
silver

no

high
in
a

despairing
speechless

the
perfect

when
the

then
the
great
old
clock
to
pieces
will
fall
sans

and
away
like

of
the
morning
steal

its
mighty

springs
aloft

the

allhearts
all
open

doors
of
thy
clockless
hall
thorn
in
the
within
my
heart
a
worm
had
long
been
hid
i
knew
it
not
when
i
went
down
and
chid
because
some
servants
of
my
inner
house
had
not
i
found
of
late
been
doing
well
but
then
i
spied
the
horror
hideous
dwelling
defiant
in
the
inmost
cell
no
not
the
inmost
for
there
god
did
dwell
but
the
small
monster
softly
burrowing
near
by
god
chamber
had
made
itself
a
den
and
lay
in
it
and
grew
the
noisome
thing
aghast
i
prayed
was
time
i
did
pray
then
but
as
i
prayed
it
seemed
the
loathsome
shape
grew
livelier
and
did
so
gnaw
and
scrape
that
i
grew
faint
whereon
to
me
he
said
some
one
that
is
who
held
my
swimming
head
lo
i
am
with
thee
let
him
do
his
worst
the
creature
is
but
not
his
work
accurst
thou
hating
him
he
is
as
a
thing
dead
then
i
lay
still
nor
thought
only
endured
at
last
i
said
lo
now
i
am
inured
a
burgess
of
pain
town
the
pain
grew
worse
then
i
cried
out
as
if
my
heart
would
break
but
he
whom
in
the
fretting
sickening
ache
i
had
forgotten
spoke
the
law
of
the
universe
is
this
he
said
weakness
shall
be
the
nurse
of
strength
the
help
i
had
will
serve
thee
too
so
i
took
courage
and
did
bear
anew
at
last
through
bones
and
flesh
and
shrinking
skin
lo
the
thing
ate
his
way
and
light
came
in
and
the
thing
died
i
knew
then
what
it
meant
and
turning
saw
the
lord
on
whom
i
leant
a
name
of
the
year
some
say
the
word
means
march
of
which
wolves
running
in
single
file
are
the
months
of
the
year
others
say
the
word
means
path
of
the
o
ye
months
of
the
year
are
ye
a
march
of
wolves
lycabas
lycabas
twelve
to
growl
and
slay
men
hearken
at
night
and
lie
in
fear
some
men
hearken
all
day
lycabas
verily
thou
art
a
gallop
of
wolves
gaunt
gray
wolves
gray
months
of
the
year
hunting
in
twelves
running
and
howling
head
to
tail
in
a
single
file
over
the
snow
a
long
low
gliding
of
silent
horror
and
fear
on
and
on
ghastly
and
drear
not
a
head
turning
not
a
foot
swerving
ye
go
twelve
making
only
a
track
onward
ye
howl
and
behind
we
wail
wail
behind
your
narrow
and
slack
wallowing
line
and
moan
and
weep
as
ye
draw
it
on
straight
and
deep
thorough
the
night
so
swart
behind
you
a
desert
and
eyes
a
long
bare
highway
stony
and
dreary
a
hungry
soul
and
a
wrapt
a
live
in
the
garment
next
the
heart
lycabas
one
of
them
hurt
me
sore
two
of
them
hurt
and
tore
three
of
them
made
me
bleed
the
fourth
did
a
terrible
deed
rent
me
the
worst
of
the
four
rent
me
and
shook
me
and
tore
and
ran
away
with
a
growl
lycabas
if
i
feared
you
a
jot
you
and
your
devils
running
in
twelves
wolves
i
would
run
like
a
wolf
i
too
and
howl
i
live
and
i
fear
you
not
but
shall
i
not
hate
you
wolves
hunting
in
ceaseless
twelves
ye
have
hunted
away
my
lambs
ye
ran
at
them
and
your
mouths
were
and
their
whiteness
with
red
foam
frothed
and
your
throats
were
a
gulf
my
lambs
they
fled
and
they
came
not
back
lovely
white
lambs
they
were
alack
they
fled
afar
and
they
left
a
track
which
at
night
when
the
lone
sky
clears
glistens
with
nature
tears
many
a
shepherd
scarce
thinks
of
a
lamb
but
he
hears
behind
it
the
growl
of
a
wolf
and
behind
that
the
wail
of
its
dam
they
ran
nor
cried
but
fled
from
day
sweet
pasture
from
night
soft
bed
ah
me
the
look
in
their
eyes
for
behind
them
rushed
the
swallowing
gulf
the
maw
of
the
wolf
and
they
fled
as
the
thing
that
speeds
or
dies
they
looked
not
behind
but
fled
as
over
the
grass
the
wind
oh
my
lambs
i
would
drop
away
into
a
night
that
never
saw
day
that
so
in
your
dear
hearts
you
might
say
is
well
for
ever
and
aye
yet
it
was
well
to
hurry
away
to
hurry
from
me
your
shepherd
gray
i
had
no
sword
to
bite
and
slay
and
the
wolfy
months
were
on
your
track
it
was
well
to
start
from
work
and
play
it
was
well
to
hurry
from
me
away
but
why
not
once
look
back
the
wolves
came
panting
down
the
lea
what
was
left
you
but
somewhere
flee
ye
saw
the
shepherd
that
never
grows
old
ye
saw
the
great
shepherd
and
him
ye
knew
and
the
wolves
never
once
came
near
to
you
for
he
saw
you
coming
threw
down
his
crook
ran
and
his
arms
about
you
threw
he
gathered
you
into
his
garment
fold
he
kneeled
he
gathered
he
lifted
you
and
his
bosom
and
arms
were
full
of
you
he
has
taken
you
home
to
his
stronghold
out
of
the
castle
of
love
ye
look
the
castle
of
love
is
now
your
home
from
the
garden
of
love
you
will
never
roam
and
the
wolves
no
more
shall
flutter
you
lycabas
lycabas
for
all
your
hunting
and
howling
and
cries
your
yelling
of
and
for
all
your
thin
tongues
and
your
fiery
eyes
your
questing
thorough
the
windy
grass
your
gurgling
gnar
and
your
horrent
hair
and
your
white
teeth
that
will
not
spare
wolves
i
fear
you
never
a
jot
though
you
come
at
me
with
your
mouths
eyes
of
fury
and
teeth
that
foam
ye
can
do
nothing
but
drive
me
home
wolves
wolves
you
will
lie
one
day
ye
are
lying
even
now
this
very
day
wolves
in
twelves
gaunt
and
gray
at
the
feet
of
the
shepherd
that
leads
the
dams
at
the
feet
of
the
shepherd
that
carries
the
lambs
and
now
that
i
see
you
with
my
mind
eye
what
are
you
indeed
my
mind
revolves
are
you
are
you
verily
wolves
i
saw
you
only
through
twilight
dark
through
rain
and
wind
and
ill
could
mark
now
i
come
near
are
you
verily
wolves
ye
have
torn
but
i
never
saw
you
slay
me
ye
have
torn
but
i
live
live
and
hope
to
live
ever
and
aye
closer
still
let
me
look
at
you
black
are
your
mouths
but
your
eyes
are
true
now
now
i
know
you
the
shepherd
friends
of
us
sheep
on
the
moors
and
bogs
lost
so
often
in
swamps
and
fogs
dear
creatures

me
i
did
you
wrong
you
to
the
castle
of
love
belong

the
sore
heart
that
made
sharp
the
tongue
your
feet
the
shepherd
sends
to
gather
the
lambs
his
little
friends
and
draw
the
sheep
after
for
rich
amends
sharp
are
your
teeth
my
wolves
divine
but
loves
and
no

your
deep
eyes

more

i
call
you
evil
names

you
with
untrue
blames

me
with
howling

biting

up
my
strength
for
the
holy
fighting

me
still
back
nor
let
me
stray
out
of
the
infinite
narrow
way
the
radiant
march
of
the
lord
of
light
home
to
the
father

he
said
and
stand
in
beauty
confront
the
day
i
have
sought
nor
found
thee
in
any
land
i
call
thee
arise
obey
the
sun
was
low
in
the
eastern
skies
when
spoke
the
confident
youth
sweet
psyche
all
day
his
hands
and
eyes
wiled
from
the
clay
uncouth
nor
ceased
when
the
shadows
came
up
like
spies
that
dog
the
steps
of
truth
he
said
i
will
do
my
will
in
spite
of
the
rising
dark
for
see
she
grows
to
my
hand
the
night
shall
hurry
and
hide
and
flee
from
the
glow
of
my
lamp
and
the
making
might
that
passeth
out
of
me
in
the
flickering
lamplight
the
figure
swayed
in
the
shadows
did
melt
and
swim
with
tool
and
thumb
he
modelled
and
made
nor
knew
that
feature
and
limb
and
mocking
eluded
him
at
the
dawning
psyche
of
his
brain
joyous
he
wrought
all
night
the
oil
went
low
and
he
trimmed
in
vain
the
lamp
would
not
burn
bright
but
he
still
wrought
on
through
the
high
he
saw
the
first
faint
light
the
dark
retreated
the
morning
spread
his
creatures
their
shapes
resume
the
plaster
stares
and
dead
a
faint
blue
liquid
bloom
lies
on
each
marble
bosom
and
head
to
his
psyche
clings
the
gloom
backward
he
stept
to
see
the
clay
his
visage
grew
white
and
sear
no
beauty
ideal
confronted
the
day
no
psyche
from
upper
sphere
but
a
once
loved
shape
that
in
darkness
lay
buried
a
lonesome
year
from
maidenhood
wilderness
fair
and
wild
a
girl
to
his
charm
had
hied
he
had
blown
out
the
lamp
of
the
trusting
child
and
in
the
darkness
she
died
now
from
the
clay
she
sadly
smiled
and
the
sculptor
stood
he
had
summoned
psyche
and
psyche
crept
from
a
tomb
she
brought
her
sad
smile
that
still
she
kept
her
eyes
she
left
in
the
gloom
high
grace
had
found
him
for
now
he
wept
and
love
was
his
endless
doom
he
pined
all
day
did
rue
he
haunted
her
form
with
sighs
as
oft
as
his
clay
to
a
lady
grew
the
carvers
with
dim
surmise
would
whisper
the
same
shape
come
to
woo
with
its
blindly
beseeching
eyes
homeless
through
still
bare
streets
and
cold
moonshine
his
homeward
way
he
bent
the
clocks
gave
out
the
midnight
sign
as
lost
in
thought
he
went
along
the
rampart
where
high
above
the
tossing
brine
seaward
his
lattice
leant
he
knew
not
why
he
left
the
throng
why
there
he
could
not
rest
what
something
pained
him
in
the
song
and
mocked
him
in
the
jest
or
why
the
flitting
crowd
among
a
moveless
moonbeam
lay
so
long
athwart
one
lady
breast
he
watched
but
saw
her
speak
to
none
saw
no
one
speak
to
her
like
one
decried
she
stood
alone
from
the
window
did
not
stir
her
hair
by
a
haunting
gust
was
blown
her
eyes
in
the
shadow
strangely
shown
she
looked
a
wanderer
he
reached
his
room
he
sought
a
book
his
brooding
to
beguile
but
ever
he
saw
her
pallid
look
her
face
too
still
to
smile
an
hour
he
sat
in
his
fireside
nook
the
time
flowed
past
like
a
silent
brook
not
a
word
he
read
the
while
vague
thoughts
absorbed
his
passive
brain
of
love
that
bleeding
lies
of
hoping
ever
and
hoping
in
vain
of
a
sorrow
that
never
dies
when
a
sudden
spatter
of
angry
rain
smote
against
every
and
he
heard
far
cries
he
looked
from
the
lattice
the
misty
moon
hardly
a
glimmer
gave
the
wind
was
like
one
that
hums
a
tune
the
first
low
gathering
stave
the
ocean
lay
in
a
sullen
swoon
with
a
moveless
monotonous
murmured
croon
like
the
moaning
of
a
slave
sudden
with
masterful
angry
blare
it
howled
from
the
watery
west
the
storm
was
up
he
had
left
his
lair
the
night
would
be
no
jest
he
turned
a
lady
sat
in
his
chair
through
her
loose
dim
robe
her
arm
came
bare
and
it
lay
across
her
breast
she
sat
a
white
queen
on
a
ruined
throne
a
lily
bowed
with
blight
in
her
eyes
the
darkness
about
was
blown
by
flashes
of
liquid
light
her
skin
with
very
whiteness
shone
back
from
her
forehead
loosely
thrown
her
hair
was
dusk
as
night
wet
wet
it
hung
and
wept
like
weeds
down
her
pearly
shoulders
bare
the
pale
drops
glistened
like
diamond
beads
caught
in
a
silken
snare
as
the
husk
to
its
seeds
her
dank
robe
clings
and
but
half
recedes
her
form
so
shadowy
fair
doubting
she
gazed
in
his
wondering
face
wonder
his
utterance
ties
she
searches
like
one
in
forgetful
case
for
something
within
his
eyes
for
something
that
love
holds
ever
in
chase
for
something
that
is
and
has
no
place
but
away
in
the
thinking
lies
speechless
he
ran
brought
a
wrap
of
wool
and
a
fur
that
with
down
might
vie
listless
into
the
gathering
pool
she
dropped
them
and
let
them
lie
he
piled
the
hearth
with
fagots
so
full
that
the
flames
as
if
from
the
log
of
yule
up
the
chimney
went
roaring
high
then
she
spoke
and
lovely
to
heart
and
ear
was
her
voice
though
broke
by
pain
afar
it
sounded
though
sweet
and
clear
as
if
from
out
of
the
rain
as
if
from
out
of
the
drear
it
came
like
the
voice
of
one
in
fear
lest
she
should
no
welcome
gain
i
am
too
far
off
to
feel
the
cold
too
cold
to
feel
the
fire
it
can
not
get
through
the
heap
of
mould
that
soaks
in
the
drip
from
the
spire
cerement
of
wax
cloth
of
gold
fur
and
wool
in
fold
on
fold
freezes
in
frost
so
dire
her
voice
and
her
eyes
and
her
cheek
so
white
thrilled
him
through
heart
and
brain
wonder
and
pity
and
love
unite
in
a
passion
of
bodiless
pain
her
beauty
possessed
him
with
strange
delight
he
was
out
with
her
in
the
live
wan
night
with
her
in
the
blowing
rain
sudden
she
rose
she
kneeled
she
flung
her
loveliness
at
his
feet
i
am
tired
of
being
blown
and
swung
in
the
rain
and
the
snow
and
the
sleet
but
better
no
rest
than
stillness
among
things
whose
names
would
defile
my
tongue
how
i
hate
the
mouldy
sheet
ah
though
a
ghost
i
a
lady
still
the
youth
recoiled
aghast
her
eyes
grew
wide
and
pale
and
chill
with
a
terror
that
surpassed
he
caught
her
hand
a
freezing
thrill
stung
to
his
wrist
but
with
steadfast
will
he
held
it
warm
and
fast
what
can
i
do
to
save
thee
dear
at
the
word
she
sprang
upright
on
tiptoe
she
stood
he
bent
his
ear
she
whispered
whispered
light
she
withdrew
she
gazed
with
an
asking
fear
like
one
that
looks
on
his
lady
bier
he
stood
with
a
face
six
times
in
vain
oh
hapless
maid
i
have
humbled
myself
to
sue
this
is
the
last
as
the
sunset
decayed
out
with
the
twilight
i
grew
and
about
the
city
flitted
and
strayed
a
wandering
lonely
forsaken
shade
no
one
saw
me
but
you
he
shivered
he
shook
he
had
turned
to
clay
vile
fear
had
gone
into
his
blood
his
face
was
a
dismal
ashy
gray
through
his
heart
crept
slime
and
mud
the
lady
stood
in
a
still
dismay
she
drooped
she
shrank
she
withered
away
like
a
frozen
bud
speak
once
more
am
i
frightful
then
i
live
though
they
call
it
death
i
am
only
cold
say
again
but
scarce
could
he
heave
a
breath
over
a
dank
and
steaming
fen
he
floated
astray
from
the
world
of
men
a
lost
wraith
ah
is
the
last
time
save
me
her
cry
entered
his
heart
and
lay
but
he
loved
the
sunshine
the
golden
sky
and
the
ghosts
moonlight
is
gray
as
feverous
visions
flit
and
fly
and
without
a
motion
elude
the
eye
she
stood
three
steps
away
but
oh
her
eyes
refusal
base
those
had
slain
frozen
eyes
in
an
icy
face
they
had
grown
like
a
ghost
of
the
brain
beside
the
lattice
in
space
she
stood
with
a
doleful
despairing
grace
the
fire
burned
clanged
the
rain
faded
or
fled
she
had
vanished
quite
the
loud
wind
sank
to
a
sigh
pale
faces
without
paled
the
face
of
night
sweeping
the
window
by
some
to
the
glass
pressed
a
cheek
of
fright
some
shot
a
gleam
of
decaying
light
from
a
flickering
uncertain
eye
whence
did
it
come
from
the
sky
or
the
deep
that
faint
wail
from
the
closing
door
of
the
steep
his
own
bosom
or
out
of
the
gale
from
the
land
where
dead
dreams
or
dead
maidens
sleep
out
of
every
night
to
come
will
creep
that
cry
his
heart
to
quail
the
clouds
had
broken
the
wind
was
at
rest
the
sea
would
be
still
ere
morn
the
moon
had
gone
down
behind
its
breast
save
the
tip
of
one
blunt
horn
was
that
the
without
a
nest
across
the
moonset
far
in
the
west
that
thin
white
vapour
borne
he
turned
from
the
lattice
the
room
with
its
chair
was
cold
and
drear
as
a
rifled
tomb
shameful
and
dreamless
and
bare
filled
it
was
with
his
own
soul
gloom
with
the
sense
of
a
traitor
merited
doom
with
a
lovely
ghost
despair
he
had
driven
a
lady
and
lightly
clad
out
in
the
stormy
cold
was
she
a
ghost
divinely
sad
are
the
people
of
hades
old
a
wandering
ghost
oh
bad
caitiff
and
craven
and
cowering
which
had
refused
her
an
earthly
fold
ill
had
she
fared
his
lovely
guest
a
passion
of
wild
tore
the
heart
that
failed
in
the
test
with
a
thousand
hooks
of
shame
bent
his
proud
head
on
his
heaving
breast
shore
the
plume
from
his
ancient
crest
puffed
at
his
ancient
name
he
sickened
with
scorn
of
a
fallen
will
with
love
and
remorse
he
wept
he
sank
and
kissed
her
footprints
chill
and
the
track
by
her
garment
swept
he
kneeled
by
her
chair
all
still
dropped
his
head
in
it
moaned
until
for
weariness
he
slept
he
slept
until
the
flaming
sun
laughed
at
the
dark
a
frightful
dream
but
the
night
is
done
he
said
and
i
hear
the
lark
all
day
he
held
out
with
the
evening
gun
a
booming
terror
his
brain
did
stun
and
doubt
the
jackal
gan
bark
followed
the
lion
conviction
fast
and
the
truth
no
dream
he
knew
night
after
night
raved
the
but
stilled
as
the
morning
grew
when
seven
slow
moons
had
come
and
passed
his
aside
he
cast
and
the
truth
appeared
untrue
a
lady
fair
old
story
vile
would
make
his
heart
her
boast
in
the
growing
glamour
of
her
smile
he
forgot
the
lovely
ghost
forgot
her
for
bitterness
wrapt
in
wile
for
the
lady
was
false
as
a
crocodile
and
her
heart
was
a
cave
of
frost
then
the
cold
white
face
with
its
woe
divine
came
back
in
the
hour
of
sighs
not
always
with
comfort
to
those
that
pine
the
dear
true
faces
arise
he
yearned
for
her
dreamed
of
her
prayed
for
a
sign
he
wept
for
her
pleading
voice
and
the
shine
of
her
solitary
eyes
with
thy
face
so
still
which
i
made
so
sad
ah
me
which
i
might
have
wooed
thou
holdest
my
heart
in
a
love
not
glad
sorrowful
come
to
me
lady
in
pardon
clad
come
to
my
dreams
white
aidead
for
on
thee
all
day
i
brood
she
came
not
he
sought
her
in
churchyards
old
in
churchyards
by
the
sea
and
in
many
a
church
when
the
midnight
tolled
and
the
moon
shone
eerily
down
to
the
crypt
he
crept
grown
bold
sat
all
night
in
the
dead
men
cold
and
called
to
her
never
came
she
praying
forgiveness
more
and
more
and
her
love
at
any
cost
pining
and
sighing
and
longing
sore
he
grew
like
a
creature
lost
thin
and
spectral
his
body
wore
he
faded
out
at
the
ghostly
door
and
was
himself
a
ghost
but
if
he
found
the
lady
then
so
sorrowfully
lost
for
lack
of
the
love
earthly
men
that
was
ready
to
brave
love
cost
i
know
not
till
i
drop
my
pen
wander
away
from
earthly
ken
and
am
myself
a
ghost
if
i
sit
in
the
dust
for
lauding
good
wine
ha
ha
it
is
just
so
sits
the
vine
abu
midjan
sang
as
he
sat
in
chains
for
the
blood
of
the
grape
ran
the
juice
of
his
veins
the
prophet
had
said
o
faithful
drink
not
abu
midjan
drank
till
his
heart
was
hot
yea
he
sang
a
song
in
praise
of
wine
he
called
it
good
names
a
joy
divine
the
giver
of
might
the
opener
of
eyes
love
handmaid
the
water
of
paradise
therefore
saad
his
chief
spake
words
of
blame
and
set
him
in
irons
a
fettered
flame
but
he
sings
of
the
wine
as
he
sits
in
his
chains
for
the
blood
of
the
grape
runs
the
juice
of
his
veins
i
will
not
think
that
the
prophet
said
shall
not
drink
of
the
flowing
red
is
a
drenched
brain
whose
cries
out
is
an
evil
thing
but
i
will
dare
with
a
goodly
drought
to
drink
nor
spare
till
my
thirst
be
out
do
not
laugh
like
a
christian
fool
but
in
silence
quaff
the
liquor
cool
at
door
of
tent
evening
star
with
daylight
spent
and
uriel
afar
then
through
the
sky
lo
the
emerald
hills
my
faith
swells
high
my
bosom
thrills
i
see
them
hearken
the
houris
that
wait
their
dark
eyes
darken
the
diamond
gate
i
hear
the
float
of
their
chant
divine
and
my
heart
like
a
boat
sails
thither
on
wine
can
an
evil
thing
make
beauty
more
or
a
sinner
bring
to
the
heavenly
door
the
fine
would
sink
and
escape
but
is
drunk
by
the
vine
is
stored
in
the
grape
and
the
prisoned
light
i
free
again
it
flows
in
might
through
my
shining
brain
i
love
and
i
know
the
truth
is
mine
i
walk
in
the
glow
of
the
wine
will
not
think
that
the
prophet
said
shall
not
drink
of
the
flowing
red
for
his
promises
lo
sevenfold
they
shine
when
the
channels
with
the
singing
wine
but
i
care
not
i
is
a
small
annoy
to
sit
in
chains
for
a
heavenly
joy
away
went
the
song
on
the
light
wind
borne
his
head
sank
down
and
a
ripple
of
scorn
shook
the
hair
that
flowed
from
his
curling
lip
as
he
eyed
his
brown
limbs
in
the
iron
grip
sudden
his
forehead
he
lifted
high
a
faint
sound
strayed
like
a
by
like
beacons
his
eyes
burst
blazing
forth
a
he
spied
in
the
distant
north
a
noise
and
a
smoke
on
the
plain
afar
is
the
cloud
and
the
clang
of
the
moslem
war
he
leapt
aloft
like
a
tiger
snared
the
wine
in
his
veins
through
his
visage
flared
he
tore
at
his
fetters
in
bootless
ire
he
called
the
prophet
he
named
his
sire
from
his
lips
with
wild
shout
the
techir
burst
he
danced
in
his
irons
the
giaours
he
cursed
and
his
eyes
they
flamed
like
a
beacon
dun
or
like
wine
in
the
crystal
twixt
eye
and
sun
the
lady
of
saad
heard
him
shout
heard
his
fetters
ring
on
the
stones
about
the
heart
of
a
warrior
she
understood
and
the
rage
of
the
thwarted
her
name
with
the
cry
of
an
angry
prayer
he
called
but
once
and
the
lady
was
there
the
giaour
he
panted
the
godless
brute
and
me
like
a
camel
tied
foot
to
foot
let
me
go
and
i
swear
by
allah
fear
at
sunset
i
don
again
this
gear
or
lie
in
a
heaven
of
starry
eyes
kissed
by
of
paradise
o
lady
grant
me
the
death
of
the
just
hark
to
the
hurtle
see
the
dust
with
ready
fingers
the
noble
dame
unlocked
her
husband
iron
blame
brought
his
second
horse
his
abdon
out
and
his
second
hauberk
light
and
stout
harnessed
the
warrior
and
hight
him
go
an
angel
of
vengeance
upon
the
foe
with
clank
of
steel
and
thud
of
hoof
away
he
galloped
she
climbed
the
roof
she
sees
the
cloud
and
the
flashes
that
leap
from
the
swords
inside
it
that
sweep
down
with
the
disordered
swath
thither
he
speeds
a
bolt
of
wrath
straight
as
an
arrow
she
sees
him
go
abu
midjan
the
singer
upon
the
foe
like
an
eagle
he
vanishes
in
the
cloud
and
the
thunder
of
battle
bursts
more
loud
mingled
of
crashes
and
blows
and
falls
of
the
whish
that
severs
the
throat
that
calls
of
neighing
and
shouting
and
groaning
grim
abu
midjan
she
sees
no
more
of
him
northward
the
battle
drifts
afar
on
the
flowing
tide
of
the
holy
war
lonely
across
the
desert
sand
from
his
wrist
by
its
thong
hung
his
clotted
brand
red
in
the
sunset
level
flame
back
to
his
bonds
abu
midjan
came
lady
i
swear
your
saad
horse
the
prophet
himself
might
have
rode
a
worse
like
the
knots
of
a
serpent
the
play
of
his
flesh
as
he
tore
to
the
quarry
in
allah
mesh
i
forgot
him
and
mowed
at
the
traitor
weeds
which
fell
before
me
like
rushes
and
reeds
or
like
the
tall
poppies
that
sudden
drop
low
their
heads
to
an
urchin
unstrung
bow
fled
the
giaour
the
faithful
flew
after
to
kill
i
turned
to
surrender
beneath
me
still
was
abdon
unjaded
fresh
in
force
faithful
and
fearless
a
heavenly
horse
give
him
water
lady
and
barley
to
eat
then
haste
thee
and
fetter
the
feet
to
the
terrace
he
went
and
she
to
the
stall
she
tended
the
horse
like
guest
in
hall
then
to
the
warrior
unhasting
returned
the
fire
of
the
fight
in
his
eyes
yet
burned
but
he
sat
in
a
silence
that
might
betoken
one
ashamed
that
his
heart
had
spoken
though
where
was
the
word
to
breed
remorse
he
had
lauded
only
his
chief
brave
horse
not
a
word
she
spoke
but
his
fetters
locked
he
watched
with
a
smile
that
himself
bemocked
she
left
him
seated
in
like
one
that
had
feared
and
fled
the
fight
but
what
singer
ever
sat
lonely
long
ere
the
hidden
fountain
burst
in
song
the
battle
wine
foamed
in
the
warrior
veins
and
he
sang
who
sat
in
chains
oh
the
wine
of
the
vine
is
a
feeble
thing
in
the
rattle
of
battle
the
true
grapes
spring
when
on
whir
of
tecbir
allah
wrath
flies
and
the
power
of
the
giaour
a
blasted
leaf
lies
when
on
force
of
the
horse
the
arm
flung
abroad
is
sweeping
and
reaping
the
harvest
of
god
ha
they
drop
from
the
top
to
the
sear
heap
below
ha
deeper
down
steeper
the
infidels
go
azrael
sheer
to
hell
shoots
the
foul
shoals
there
monker
and
nakir
torture
their
souls
but
when
drop
on
their
crop
the
scimitars
red
and
under
war
thunder
the
faithful
lie
dead
oh
bright
is
the
light
on
hero
slow
breaking
rapturous
faces
bent
for
embraces
watch
for
his
waking
and
he
hears
in
his
ears
the
voice
of
life
river
like
a
song
of
the
strong
jubilant
ever
oh
the
wine
of
the
vine
may
lead
to
the
gates
but
the
rattle
of
battle
wakes
the
angel
who
waits
to
the
lord
of
the
sword
open
it
must
the
drinker
the
thinker
sits
in
the
dust
he
dreams
of
the
gleams
of
their
garments
of
white
he
misses
their
kisses
the
maidens
of
light
they
long
for
the
strong
who
has
burst
through
alarms
up
by
the
labour
of
stirrup
and
sabre
up
to
their
arms
oh
the
wine
of
the
grape
is
a
feeble
ghost
the
wine
of
the
fight
is
the
joy
of
a
host
when
saad
came
home
from
the
far
pursuit
an
hour
he
sat
and
an
hour
was
mute
then
he
opened
his
mouth
ah
wife
the
fight
had
been
lost
full
sure
but
an
arm
of
might
sudden
rose
up
on
the
crest
of
the
battle
flashed
blue
lightnings
thundered
steel
rattle
took
up
the
fighting
and
drove
it
on
enoch
sure
or
the
good
saint
john
wherever
he
leaped
like
a
lion
he
the
battle
was
thickest
or
soon
to
be
wherever
he
sprang
with
his
lion
roar
in
a
minute
the
battle
was
there
no
more
with
a
headlong
fear
the
sinners
fled
and
we
swept
them
down
the
steep
of
the
dead
before
us
not
from
us
did
they
flee
they
ceased
in
the
depths
of
a
new
red
sea
but
him
who
saved
us
we
saw
no
more
he
went
as
he
came
by
a
secret
door
and
strangest
of
all
nor
think
i
err
if
a
miracle
i
for
truth
aver
i
was
close
to
him
thrice
the
holy
force
wore
my
hauberk
rode
abdon
my
horse
the
lady
rose
up
withholding
her
word
and
led
to
the
terrace
her
wondering
lord
where
and
weary
with
battle
strain
abu
midjan
sat
counting
the
links
of
his
chain
the
battle
was
raging
he
raging
worse
i
freed
him
harnessed
him
gave
him
thy
horse
abu
midjan
the
singer
of
love
and
of
wine
the
arm
of
the
battle
it
also
was
thine
rise
up
shake
the
irons
from
off
thy
feet
for
the
lord
of
the
fight
are
fetters
meet
if
thou
wilt
then
drink
till
thou
be
hoar
allah
shall
judge
thee
i
judge
no
more
abu
midjan
arose
he
flung
aside
the
clanking
fetters
and
thus
he
cried
if
thou
give
me
to
god
and
his
decrees
nor
purge
my
sin
with
the
shame
of
these
wrath
against
me
i
dare
not
store
in
the
name
of
allah
i
drink
no
more
thankless
it
is
may
and
the
moon
leans
down
at
night
over
a
blossomy
land
leans
from
her
window
a
lady
white
with
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
oh
why
in
the
blue
so
misty
moon
why
so
dull
in
the
sky
thou
like
one
that
is
ready
to
swoon
because
her
is
dry
enough
enough
of
longing
and
wail
oh
bird
i
pray
thee
be
glad
sing
to
me
once
dear
nightingale
the
old
song
merry
mad
hold
hold
with
thy
blossoming
colourless
cold
white
as
woe
blossom
yet
once
with
the
blossom
of
old
let
the
roses
shine
through
the
snow
the
moon
and
the
blossoms
they
gloomily
gleam
the
bird
will
not
be
glad
the
dead
never
speak
when
the
mournful
dream
they
are
too
weak
and
sad
listened
she
listless
till
night
grew
late
bound
by
a
weary
spell
then
clanked
the
latch
of
the
and
a
wondrous
thing
befell
out
burst
the
gladness
up
dawned
the
love
in
the
song
in
the
waiting
show
grew
silver
the
moon
in
the
sky
above
blushed
rosy
the
blossom
below
but
the
merry
bird
nor
the
silvery
moon
nor
the
blossoms
that
flushed
the
night
had
one
poor
thanks
for
the
granted
boon
the
lady
forgot
them
quite
of
the
prince
breacan
of
denmark
was
lord
of
the
strand
and
lord
of
the
billowy
sea
lord
of
the
sea
and
lord
of
the
land
he
might
have
let
maidens
be
a
maiden
he
met
with
locks
of
gold
straying
beside
the
sea
maidens
listened
in
days
of
old
and
repented
grievously
wiser
he
left
her
in
evil
wiles
went
sailing
over
the
sea
came
to
the
lord
of
the
western
isles
give
me
thy
daughter
said
he
the
lord
of
the
isles
he
laughed
and
said
only
a
king
of
the
sea
may
think
the
maid
of
the
isles
to
wed
and
such
men
call
not
thee
hold
thine
own
three
nights
and
days
in
yon
whirlpool
of
the
sea
or
turn
thy
prow
and
go
thy
ways
and
let
the
be
prince
breacan
he
turned
his
dragon
prow
to
denmark
over
the
sea
wise
women
he
said
now

me
how
in
yon
whirlpool

a
cable
of
hemp
and
a
cable
of
wool
and

thee
back
to
the
roaring

there
the
smiths
of

on
the

will
forge
three
anchors

shalt
pull
thou
shalt
shear
the
wool
and
the
maidens

bring
their
hair
of

brown
thou
shalt
twist
one
strand
of
the

shalt
twine
a
band
to
bind

they
forged
three

and
the

brought
their

he
twisted
the
brown

twined
the
golden

in
a

him
back
to

he
cast
the

there
the
whirlpool
roared
and
the
day
went
by
and
night
came
down
on
the
sea
but
or
ever
the
morning
broke
the
sky
the
hemp
was
broken
in
three
the
night
it
came
down
the
whirlpool
it
ran
the

it
fiercely
blew
and
or
ever
the

began
the

the
storm
it
roared
all

the
third
the

wallowed
about
the
night
came
down
like
a
wild
black
bird
but
the
cable
of
hair
held
out
round
and
round
with
a
giddy
swing
went
the
through
the
dark
round
went
the
rope
in
the
round
reeled
the
straining
bark
prince
breacan
he
stood
on
his
dragon
prow
a
lantern
in
his
hand
blest
be
the
maidens
of
denmark
now
by
them
shall
denmark
stand
he
watched
the
rope
through
the
tempest
black
a
lantern
in
his
hold
out
out
alack
one
strand
will
crack
it
is
the
strand
of
gold
the
third
morn
clear
and
calm
came
out
no
anchored
ship
was
there
the
golden
strand
in
the
cable
stout
was
not
all
of
maidens
hair
dead
the
witch
lady
walked
along
the
strand
heard
a
roaring
of
the
sea
on
the
edge
of
a
pool
saw
a
dead
man
hand
good
thing
for
a
witch
lady
lightly
she
stepped
across
the
rocks
came
where
the
dead
man
lay
now
pretty
maid
with
your
merry
mocks
now
i
shall
have
my
way
on
a
finger
shone
a
sapphire
blue
in
the
heart
of
six
rubies
red
come
back
to
me
my
promise
true
come
back
my
ring
she
said
she
took
the
dead
hand
in
the
live
and
at
the
ring
drew
she
the
dead
hand
closed
its
fingers
five
and
it
held
the
witch
lady
she
swore
the
storm
was
not
her
deed
dark
spells
she
backward
spoke
if
the
dead
man
heard
he
took
no
heed
but
held
like
a
cloven
oak
deathly
cold
crept
up
the
tide
sure
of
her
made
no
haste
crept
up
to
her
knees
crept
up
each
side
crept
up
to
her
wicked
waist
over
the
blue
sea
sailed
the
bride
in
her
love
own
sailing
ship
and
the
witch
she
saw
them
across
the
tide
as
it
rose
to
her
lying
lip
oh
the
heart
of
the
dead
and
the
hand
of
the
dead
are
strong
hasps
they
to
hold
fled
the
true
dove
with
the
kite
new
love
and
left
the
false
kite
with
the
old
minor
ditties
the
as
to
her
child
a
mother
calls
come
to
me
child
come
near
calling
in
silent
intervals
the
master
voice
i
hear
but
does
he
call
me
verily
to
have
me
does
he
care
why
should
he
seek
my
poverty
my
selfishness
so
bare
the
dear
voice
makes
his
gladness
brim
but
not
a
child
can
know
why
that
large
woman
cares
for
him
why
she
should
love
him
so
lord
to
thy
call
of
me
i
bow
obey
like
abraham
thou
me
because
thou
art
thou
and
i
am
what
i
am
doubt
whispers
art
such
a
blot
he
can
not
love
poor
if
what
i
am
he
loveth
not
he
loves
what
i
shall
be
nay
that
which
can
be
drawn
and
wooed
and
turned
away
from
ill
is
what
his
father
made
for
good
he
loves
me
i
say
still
to
give
a
thing
and
take
again
is
counted
meanness
among
men
to
take
away
what
once
is
given
can
not
then
be
the
way
of
heaven
but
human
hearts
are
crumbly
stuff
and
never
never
love
enough
therefore
god
takes
and
with
a
smile
puts
our
best
things
away
a
while
thereon
some
weep
some
rave
some
scorn
some
wish
they
never
had
been
born
some
humble
grow
at
last
and
still
and
then
god
gives
them
what
they
will
prophets
tell
us
we
shall
not
them
that
walked
our
fellows
in
the
ways
below
smoking
smouldering
tophets
steaming
hopeless
plaints
dreary
prophets
mean
saints
knowing
not
the
father
what
their
prophecies
grapes
of
such
none
gather
only
thorns
and
lies
loving
thus
the
brother
how
the
father
tell
go
without
each
other
to
your
heavenly
hell
o
thou
that
walkest
with
nigh
hopeless
feet
past
the
one
harbour
built
for
thee
and
thine
doth
no
stray
odour
from
its
table
greet
no
truant
beam
from
fire
or
candle
shine
at
his
wide
door
the
host
doth
stand
and
call
at
every
lattice
gracious
forms
invite
thou
seest
but
a
solid
wall
in
forest
sullen
with
the
things
of
night
thou
cravest
rest
and
rest
for
thee
doth
crave
the
white
sheet
folded
down
white
robe
shame
faithless
no
i
do
not
mean
the
grave
i
mean
love
very
house
and

and
heart
when
thou
away
from
ill
christ
is
this
side
of
thy
hill
when
thou
turnest
toward
good
christ
is
walking
in
thy
wood
when
thy
heart
says
father
pardon
then
the
lord
is
in
thy
garden
when
stern
duty
wakes
to
watch
then
his
hand
is
on
the
latch
but
when
hope
thy
song
doth
rouse
then
the
lord
is
in
the
house
when
to
love
is
all
thy
wit
christ
doth
at
thy
table
sit
when
god
will
is
thy
heart
pole
then
is
christ
thy
very
soul

drearer
father
thou
art
coming
nearer
for
thee
coming
i
would
watch
with
my
hand
upon
the
latch
of
the
door
i
mean
that
faces
out
upon
the
eternal
spaces
of
the
waiting
with
us
there
is
no
gray
fearing
with
us
no
aching
for
lack
for
the
morn
it
is
always
nearing
and
the
night
is
at
our
back
at
times
a
song
will
fall
dumb
a
burst
in
a
sigh
but
no
one
says
he
will
not
come
she
says
he
is
almost
nigh
the
thing
you
call
a
sorrow
is
our
delight
on
its
way
we
know
that
the
coming
morrow
comes
on
the
wheels
of
our
past
is
a
child
asleep
delay
is
ripening
the
kiss
the
rising
tear
we
will
not
weep
until
it
flow
for
bliss
trust
him
in
the
common
light
trust
him
in
the
awesome
night
trust
him
when
the
earth
doth
quake
trust
him
when
thy
heart
doth
ache
trust
him
when
thy
brain
doth
reel
and
thy
friend
turns
on
his
heel
trust
him
when
the
way
is
rough
cry
not
yet
is
but
obey
with
true
endeavour
else
the
salt
hath
lost
his
savour

in
the
i
would
i
were
an
angel
strong
an
angel
of
the
sun
hasting
along
i
would
i
were
just
come
awake
a
child
outbursting
from
night
dusky
brake
or
lark
whose
inward
upward
fate
mocks
every
wall
that
masks
the
heavenly
gate
or
hopeful
cock
whose
clarion
clear
shrills
ten
times
ere
a
film
of
dawn
appear
or
but
a
glowworm
even
then
my
light
would
come
straight
from
the
light
of
men
i
am
a
dead
seed
dark
and
slow
father
of
larks
and
children
make
me
grow
when
i
am
dead
unto
myself
and
let
o
father
thee
live
on
in
me
contented
to
do
nought
but
pay
my
debt
and
leave
the
house
to
thee
then
shall
i
be
thy
ransomed
from
the
cark
of
living
from
the
strain
for
breath
from
tossing
in
my
coffin
strait
and
dark
at
hourly
strife
with
death

mercy
in
my
coffin
and

will
be

ever
conscious
buoyant
clear
and
free
will

in
darkest
hour
where
now
i
sit
alone
unmoving
calm
with
windows
open
to
thy
wind
shall
i
not
know
thee
in
the
radiant
psalm
soaring
from
heart
and
mind
the
body
of
this
death
will
melt
away
and
i
shall
know
as
i
am

thee
my

hour
and

as
thou
me
thine

in
me
is
heavy
as

of
my
sorrows

so
wide
and
i
am
all
alone
thou
walk
so
with
eyes
down
bent
upon
the
earth
radiant
clay
that
thou
seen
no
star
in
all

not
thy
tears
made
pools
first
on

ah
little
knowest
thou

in
a
cloak
around
thee
thrown
full
many
a
saving
toiling

but
not
one
step
alone
lift
but
thy
languid
head
and
see
thy
guide
let
thy
steps
go
in
his
nor
choose
thine
own
then
soon
wilt
thou
thine
eyes
with
wonder
wide
cry
i
know
i
never
was

of
old
to

lonely

with

sorrow
from
the
dim
fields
of
tomorrow
let
her
roam
there
all
unheeded
she
will
come
when
she
is
needed
then
when
she
draws
near
thy
door
she
will
find
god
there
before
lie
little
cow
and
chew
thy
cud
the
farmer
soon
will
shift
thy
tether
chirp
linnet
on
the
frozen

sun
and

will
come
together
wait

for
god
and
thou
shalt
bud
he
waits
thy
waiting
with
his
weather
but
lost
the
little
one
roams
about
pathway
or
shelter
none
can
find
blinking
stars
are
coming
out
no
one
is
moving
but
the
wind
it
is
no
use
to
cry
or

all
the
world
is
still
as
a
mouse
one
thing
only
eases
her
mind
father
knows
i
not
in
the
house
and
when
thy
heart
grows
graver
and
eternal

looks
nearer

thy

the

with
its
dim

the
shell

took
it
for
a
bird
of

soared
high
over

thought
from
thee
when

again

he
cry
out
for

because
the
night
was
dark

wild
and
no

else
was
near
shall
i
then
treat
thee
father
as
my
fatherhood
would
grieve
i
will
be
hopeful
though
alas
i
can
not
quite
believe
i
had
no
power
no
wish
to
be
thou
madest
me
half
blind
the
darkness
comes
i
cling
to
thee

thou
my
perfect

poems
for
children
for
a
i
there
breathes
not
a
breath
of
the
summer
air
but
the
spirit
of
love
is
moving
there
not
a
trembling
leaf
on
the
shadowy
tree
flutters
with
hundreds
in
harmony
but
that
spirit
can
part
its
tone
from
the
rest
and
read
the
life
in
its
beetle
breast
when
the
sunshiny
butterflies
come
and
go
like
flowers
paying
visits
to
and
fro
not
a
single
wave
of
their
fanning
wings
is
unfelt
by
the
spirit
that
feeleth
all
things
the
moths
that
sleep
at
noon
and
rove
in
the
light
of
the
gentler
moon
and
the
myriad
gnats
that
dance
like
a
wall
or
a
moving
column
that
will
not
fall
and
the
that
go
burning
by
shot
like
a
glance
from
a
seeking
eye
there
is
one
being
that
loves
them
all
not
a
fly
in
a
spider
web
can
fall
but
he
cares
for
the
spider
and
cares
for
the
fly
he
cares
for
you
whether
you
laugh
or
cry
cares
whether
your
mother
smile
or
sigh
how
he
cares
for
so
many
i
do
not
know
but
it
would
be
too
strange
if
he
did
not
so
dreadful
and
dreary
for
even
a
fly
so
i
can
not
wait
for
the
and
but
believe
that
all
things
are
gathered
and
nursed
in
the
love
of
him
whose
love
went
first
and
made
this
world
like
a
huge
great
nest
for
a
hen
to
sit
on
with
feathery
breast
ii
the
bird
on
the
leafy
tree
the
bird
in
the
cloudy
sky
the
hart
in
the
forest
free
the
stag
on
the
mountain
high
the
fish
inside
the
sea
the
albatross
asleep
on
the
outside
of
the
deep
the
bee
through
the
summer
sunny
hunting
for
wells
of
honey
what
is
the
thought
in
the
breast
of
the
little
bird
in
its
nest
what
is
the
thought
in
the
songs
the
lark
in
the
sky
prolongs
what
mean
the
dolphin
rays
winding
his
watery
ways
what
is
the
thought
of
the
stag
stately
on
yonder
crag
what
does
the
albatross
think
dreaming
upon
the
brink
of
the
mountain
billow
and
then
dreaming
down
in
its
glen
what
is
the
thought
of
the
bee
fleeting
so
silently
or
flitting
with
busy
hum
but
a
careless
from
to
chalice
like
a
prince
from
palace
to
palace
what
makes
them
alive
so
very
some
of
them
surely
merry
and
others
so
stately
calm
they
might
be
singing
a
psalm
i
can
not
tell
what
they
think
only
know
they
eat
and
drink
and
on
all
that
lies
about
with
a
quiet
heart
look
out
each
after
its
kind
stately
or
coy
solemn
like
man
gamesome
like
boy
glad
with
its
own
mysterious
joy
and
god
who
knows
their
thoughts
and
ways
though
his
the
creatures
do
not
know
from
his
full
heart
fills
each
of
theirs
into
them
all
his
breath
doth
go
good
and
better
with
them
he
shares
content
with
their
bliss
while
they
have
no
prayers
he
takes
their
joy
for
praise
if
thou
wouldst
be
like
him
little
one
go
and
be
kind
with
a
kindness
undefiled
who
gives
for
the
pleasure
of
thanks
my
child
god
gladness
can
not
know

root
met
root
in
the
spongy
ground
searching
each
for
food
each
turned
aside
and
away
it
wound
and
each
got
something
good
sound
met
sound
in
the
wavy
air
that
made
a
little
they
jostled
not
long
but
were
quick
and
fair
each
found
its
path
and
flew

dashed
on
drop
as
the
fell
they
joined
and
sank
below
in
gathered
thousands
they
rose
a

with
a
singing
overflow

met
wind
in
a
garden
green
they
began
to
push
and

a
tearing
whirlwind

between

love
lies
bleeding
yet
makes
summer
winter
froze
both
brook
and
well
fast
and
fast
the
snowflakes
fell
children
gathered
round
the
hearth
made
a
summer
of
their
mirth
when
a
boy
so
lately
come
that
his
life
was
yet
one
sum
of
delights
of
aimless
rambles
romps
and
dreams
and
games
and
gambols
thought
aloud
i
wish
i
knew
what
makes
summer
that
i
do
father
heard
and
it
did
show
him
how
to
write
a
little
poem
what
makes
summer
little
one
do
you
ask
it
is
the
sun
want
of
heat
is
all
the
harm
summer
is
but
winter
warm
is
the
sun
yes
that
one
there
dim
and
gray
low
in
the
air
now
he
looks
at
us
askance
but
will
lift
his
countenance
higher
up
and
look
down
straighter
rise
much
earlier
set
much
later
till
we
sing
out
hail
thou
hast
brought
our
own
old
summer
when
the
sun
thus
rises
early
and
keeps
shining
all
day
rarely
up
he
draws
the
larks
to
meet
him
earth
wild
to
greet
him
up
he
draws
the
clouds
and
pours
down
again
their
shining
showers
out
he
draws
the
grass
and
clover
daisies
buttercups
all
over
out
he
wiles
all
flowers
to
stare
at
their
father
in
the
air
he
all
light
they
how
much
duller
yet
of
every
colour
then
he
draws
their
odours
out
sends
them
on
the
winds
about
next
he
draws
out
flying
things
out
of
eggs
wings
out
of
lumps
like
frozen
snails
butterflies
with
splendid
sails
draws
the
blossoms
from
the
trees
from
their
hives
the
buzzy
bees
golden
things
from
muddy
cracks
beetles
with
their
burnished
backs
laughter
draws
he
from
the
river
gleaming
back
to
the
light
he
sends
to
every
nook
that
no
creature
be
forsook
draws
from
gloom
and
pain
and
sadness
hope
and
blessing
peace
and
gladness
making
man
heart
sing
and
shine
with
his
brilliancy
divine
summer
thus
it
is
he
makes
it
and
the
little
child
he
takes
it
day
work
done
adown
the
west
lingering
he
goes
to
rest
like
a
child
who
blissful
yet
is
unwilling
to
forget
and
though
sleepy
heels
and
head
thinks
he
can
not
go
to
bed
even
when
down
behind
the
hill
back
his
bright
look
shineth
still
whose
keen
glory
with
the
night
makes
the
lovely
gray
twilight
drawing
out
the
downy
owl
with
his
musical
drawing
out
the
leathery
bats
mice
they
are
turned
airy
cats
noiseless
sly
and
slippery
things
swimming
through
the
air
on
wings
drawing
out
the
feathery
moth
lazy
drowsy
very
loath
drawing
children
to
the
door
for
one
more
drawing
from
the
tails
glimmers
green
in
grassy
dales
making
ocean
glow
as
if
they
were
then
the
moon
comes
up
the
hill
wide
awake
but
dreaming
still
soft
and
slow
as
if
in
fear
lest
her
path
should
not
be
clear
like
a
timid
lady
she
looks
around
her
daintily
begs
the
clouds
to
come
about
her
tells
the
stars
to
shine
without
her
then
unveils
and
bolder
grown
climbs
the
steps
of
her
blue
throne
stately
in
a
calm
delight
mistress
of
a
whole
fair
night
lonely
but
for
stars
a
few
there
she
sits
in
silence
blue
and
the
world
before
her
lies
faint
a
round
shade
in
the
skies
but
what
fun
is
all
about
when
the
humans
are
shut
out
shadowy
to
the
moon
the
earth
is
a
very
world
of
mirth
night
is
then
a
dream
opaque
full
of
creatures
wide
awake
noiseless
then
on
feet
or
wings
out
they
come
all
things
in
and
out
they
pop

the

her

snare
all
the

all
the

the
magic
all
the
comic
and

tragic
all
the

of
song

trundles
all

what
doth

you
ask
able
for
such
mighty
task
he
is
not
a
lamp
hung
high
sliding
up
and
down
the
sky
he
is
carried
in
a
hand
that
what
makes
him
strong
and
grand
from
that
hand
comes
all
his
power
if
it
set
him
down
one
hour
yea
one
moment
set
him
by
in
that
moment
he
would
die
and
the
winter
ice

never

i
tell
you
whose
the
hand
bears

high

beautiful
mother
is
busy
all
day
so
busy
she
neither
can
sing
nor
say
but
lovely
thoughts
in
a
ceaseless
flow
through
her
eyes
and
her
ears
and
her
bosom
go
motion
sight
and
sound
and
scent
weaving
a
royal
rich
content
when
night
is
come
and
her
children
sleep
beautiful
mother
her
watch
doth
keep
with
glowing
stars
in
her
dusky
hair
down
she
sits
to
her
music
rare
and
her
instrument
that
never
fails
is
the
hearts
and
the
throats
of
her
nightingales
kiss
me
there
now
little
neddy
do
you
see
her
staring
steady
there
again
you
had
a
chance
of
her
did
you
catch
the
pretty
glance
of
her
see
her
nest
on
any
planet
never
was
a
sweeter
than
it
never
nest
was
such
as
this
is
tis
the
nest
of
all
the
kisses
with
the
mother
sitting
all
through
christmas
never
flitting
kisses
kisses
kisses
hatching
sweetest
birdies
for
the
catching
oh
the
precious
little
brood
always
in
a
loving
mood
there
one
under
mamy
hood
there
that
one
i
caught
this
minute
musical
as
any
linnet
where
it
is
your
big
eyes
question
with
of
doubt
a
wee
suggestion
there
it
is
upon
mouth
merry
there
it
is
upon
cheek
cherry
there
another
on
now
it
off
and
lights
on
minnie
there
another
on
there
another
on
and
the
is
hatching
hundreds
more
for
only
catching
why
the
mistletoe
she
chooses
and
the
refuses
there
a
puzzle
for
your
mother
i
present
you
with
another
tell
me
why
you
cruel
heartless
why
of
all
the
trees
before
her
gathered
round
or
spreading
her
jenny
wren
should
choose
the
apple
for
her
nursery
and
chapel
or
jack
daw
build
in
the
steeple
high
above
the
praying
people
tell
me
why
the
limping
plover
moist
meadow
likes
to
hover
why
the
partridge
with
such
trouble
builds
her
nest
where
soon
the
stubble
will
betray
her
to
the
eyes
of
all
the
reapers
tell
me
charley
tell
me
janey
answer
all
or
answer
any
and
i
tell
you
with
much
pleasure
why
this
little
bird
of
treasure
nestles
only
in
the
mistletoe
never
never
goes
the
thistle
to
not
an
answer
tell
without
it
yes
all
that
i
know
about
it
mistletoe
then
can
not
flourish
can
not
find
the
food
to
nourish
but
on
other
plant
when
planted
and
for
kissing
two
are
wanted
that
is
why
the
looks
about
for
sturdy
and
the
plant
that
grows
upon
it
like
a
on
a
bonnet
but
my
blessed
little
mannie
all
the
birdies
are
not
cannie
that
the
hatches
some
are
worthless
little
patches
which
indeed
if
they
do
smutch
you
they
dead
before
they
touch
you
while
for
kisses
vain
and
greedy
kisses
flattering
kisses
needy
they
are
birds
that
never
waddled
out
of
eggs
that
only
addled
some
there
are
leave
spots
behind
them
on
your
cheek
for
years
you
find
them
little
ones
i
do
beseech
you
never
let
such
birdies
reach
you
it
depends
what
net
you
venture
what
the
sort
of
bird
will
enter
i
will
tell
you
in
a
minute
what
net
takes
kiss
lark
or
linnet
any
bird
indeed
worth
hatching
and
just
therefore
worth
the
catching
the
one
net
that
never
misses
catching
at
least
some
true
kisses
is
the
heart
that
loving
truly
always
loves
the
old
love
newly
but
to
spread
out
would
undo
it
let
the
birdies
fly
into
it
nobody
knows
the
world
but
me
the
rest
go
to
bed
i
sit
up
and
see
i
a
better
observer
than
any
of
you
all
for
i
never
look
out
till
the
twilight
fall
and
never
then
without
green
glasses
and
that
is
how
my
wisdom
passes
i
never
think
for
that
is
not
fit
i
have
seen
the
white
moon
sit
on
her
nest
the
sea
like
a
fluffy
owl
hatching
the
boats
and
the
fowl
when
the
oysters
gape
you
may
make
a
note
she
drops
a
pearl
into
every
throat
i
can
see
the
wind
can
you
do
that
i
see
the
dreams
he
has
in
his
hat
i
see
him
shaking
them
out
as
he
goes
i
see
them
rush
in
at
man
snoring
nose
ten
thousand
things
you
could
not
think
i
can
write
down
plain
with
pen
and
ink
you
know
that
i
know
therefore
pull
off
your
hat
whether
round
and
tall
or
square
and
flat
you
can
not
do
better
than
trust
in
me
you
may
shut
your
eyes
in
fact
see
lifelong
i
will
lead
you
and
then
like
the
owl
i
will
bury
you
nicely
with
my
spade
and
showl
i
will
sing
a
song
said
the
owl
you
sing
a
song
ugly
fowl
what
will
you
sing
about
night
in
and
day
out
all
about
the
night
when
the
gray
with
her
cloak
smothers
bright
hard
sharp
day
oh
the
moon
the
cool
dew
and
the
shadows
i
will
sing
a
song
said
the
nightingale

a
song
long
long
little
neverfail
what
will
you
sing
about
day
in
or
day
out
all
about
the
light
gone
away
down
away
and
out
of
sight

up
day
for
the
master

not
dead
only
gone
to
bed
i
will
sing
a
song
said
the
lark

little
what
will
you
sing
about
day
in
and
night
out
i
can
only
call
i
ca
think
let
me
up
that
all
i
see
a
chink
i
been
thirsting
all
night
for
the
glorious
light
i
have
only
one
foot
but
thousands
of
toes
my
one
foot
stands
well
but
never
goes
i
a
good
many
arms
if
you
count
them
all
but
hundreds
of
fingers
large
and
small
from
the
ends
of
my
fingers
my
beauty
grows
i
breathe
with
my
hair
and
i
drink
with
my
toes
i
grow
bigger
and
bigger
about
the
waist
although
i
am
always
very
tight
laced
none
saw
me
eat
i
no
mouth
to
bite
yet
i
eat
all
day
and
digest
all
night
in
the
summer
with
song
i
shake
and
quiver
but
in
winter
i
fast
and
groan
and
shiver
ii
there
is
a
plough
that
hath
no
share
only
a
coulter
that
parteth
fair
but
the
ridges
they
rise
to
a
terrible
size
or
ever
the
coulter
comes
near
to
tear
the
horses
and
ridges
fierce
battle
make
the
horses
are
safe
but
the
plough
may
break
seed
cast
in
its
furrows
or
green
or
sear
will
lift
to
the
sun
neither
blade
nor
ear
down
it
drops
plumb
where
no
come
nor
needeth
it
any
harrowing
gear
wheat
nor
poppy
nor
blade
has
been
found
able
to
grow
on
the
naked
ground
for
my
grandchild
iii
who
is
it
that
sleeps
like
a
top
all
night
and
wakes
in
the
morning
so
fresh
and
bright
that
he
breaks
his
bed
as
he
gets
up
and
leaves
it
smashed
like
a
china
cup
iv
i
a
very
long
nose
but
what
of
that
it
is
not
too
long
to
lie
on
a
mat
i
have
very
big
jaws
but
never
get
fat
i
do
go
to
church
and
i
not
a
church
rat
i
a
mouth
in
my
middle
my
food
goes
in
at
just
like
a
skate
that
a
fish
that
a
flat
in
summer
i
seldom
able
to
breathe
but
when
winter
his
blades
in
ice
doth
sheathe
i
swell
my
one
lung
i
look
big
and
i
puff
and
i
sometimes
there
that
enough
where
did
you
come
from
baby
dear
out
of
the
everywhere
into
here
where
did
you
get
those
eyes
so
blue
out
of
the
sky
as
i
came
through
what
makes
the
light
in
them
sparkle
and
spin
some
of
the
starry
twinkles
left
in
where
did
you
get
that
little
tear
i
found
it
waiting
when
i
got
here
what
makes
your
forehead
so
smooth
and
high
a
soft
hand
stroked
it
as
i
went
by
what
makes
your
cheek
like
a
warm
white
rose
i
saw
something
better
than
any
one
knows
whence
that
smile
of
bliss
three
angels
gave
me
at
once
a
kiss
where
did
you
get
this
pearly
ear
god
spoke
and
it
came
out
to
hear
where
did
you
get
those
arms
and
hands
love
made
itself
into
bonds
and
bands
feet
whence
did
you
come
you
darling
things
from
the
same
box
as
the
cherubs
wings
how
did
they
all
just
come
to
be
you
god
thought
about
me
and
so
i
grew
but
how
did
you
come
to
us
you
dear
god
thought
about
you
and
so
i
am
here
the
sun
is
gone
down
and
the
moon
in
the
sky
but
the
sun
will
come
up
and
the
moon
be
laid
by
the
flower
is
asleep
but
it
is
not
dead
when
the
morning
shines
it
will
lift
its
head
when
winter
comes
it
will
die
no
no
it
will
only
hide
from
the
frost
and
snow
sure
is
the
summer
sure
is
the
sun
the
night
and
the
winter
away
they
run
in
the
what
would
you
see
if
i
took
you
up
my
little
you
would
see
the
sky
like
a
clear
blue
cup
turned
upside
down
in
the
air
what
would
you
do
up
my
in
my
little
nest
on
the
tree
with
cry
upon
cry
you
would
ripple
the
air
to
get
at
what
you
would
see
and
what
would
you
reach
in
the
top
of
the
tree
to
still
your
grasping
grief
not
a
star
would
you
clutch
of
all
you
would
see
you
would
gather
just
one
green
leaf
but
when
you
had
lost
your
greedy
grief
content
to
see
from
afar
your
hand
it
would
hold
a
withering
leaf
but
your
heart
a
shining
star
the
lightning
and
thunder
they
go
and
they
come
but
the
stars
and
the
stillness
are
always
at
home
little
she
has
lost
her
sheep
and
will
not
know
where
to
find
them
they
are
over
the
height
and
out
of
sight
trailing
their
tails
behind
them
little
woke
out
of
her
sleep
jump
up
and
set
out
to
find
them
the
silly
things
they
got
no
wings
and
they
left
their
trails
behind
them
they
taken
their
tails
but
they
left
their
trails
and
so
i
shall
follow
and
find
them
for
wherever
a
tail
had
dragged
a
trail
the
grass
lay
bent
behind
them
she
washed
in
the
brook
and
caught
up
her
crook
and
after
her
sheep
did
run
along
the
trail
that
went
up
the
dale
across
the
grass
in
the
sun
she
ran
with
a
will
and
she
came
to
a
hill
that
went
up
steep
like
a
spire
on
its
very
top
the
sun
seemed
to
stop
and
burned
like
a
flame
of
fire
but
now
she
went
slow
for
the
hill
did
go
up
steeper
as
she
went
higher
when
she
reached
its
crown
the
sun
was
down
leaving
a
trail
of
fire
and
her
sheep
were
gone
and
hope
she
had
none
for
now
was
no
trail
behind
them
yes
there
they
were
and
fair
but
to
see
was
not
to
find
them
golden
in
hue
and
rosy
and
blue
and
white
as
blossom
of
pears
her
sheep
they
did
run
in
the
trail
of
the
sun
as
she
had
been
running
in
theirs
after
the
sun
like
clouds
they
did
run
but
she
knew
they
were
her
sheep
she
sat
down
to
cry
and
look
up
at
the
sky
but
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
and
as
she
slept
the
dew
down
wept
and
the
wind
did
blow
from
the
sky
and
doings
strange
brought
a
lovely
change
she
woke
with
a
different
cry
nibble
nibble
crop
without
a
stop
a
hundred
little
lambs
did
pluck
and
eat
the
grass
so
sweet
that
grew
in
the
trail
of
their
dams
she
gave
one
look
she
caught
up
her
crook
wiped
away
the
sleep
that
did
blind
her
and
without
a
stop
the
lambs
came
nibbling
behind
her
home
home
she
came
both
tired
and
lame
with
three
times
as
large
a
stock
in
a
month
or
more
they
be
sheep
as
before
a
lovely
flock
but
what
will
she
say
if
one
fine
day
when
they
got
their
bushiest
tails
their
game
should
be
just
the
same
and
again
she
must
follow
mere
trails
never
weep
though
you
lose
your
sheep
tears
will
turn
in
the
trail
of
the
sun
if
the
mothers
did
run
the
lambs
are
sure
to
run
after
but
a
day
is
coming
when
little
feet
drumming
will
wake
you
up
to
find
them
all
the
old
sheep
how
your
heart
will
leap
with
their
big
little
lambs
behind
them
boy
little
boy
blue
lost
his
way
in
a
wood
apples
and
cherries
roses
and
honey
he
said
i
would
not
go
back
if
i
could
all
so
jolly
and
funny
he
sang
this
wood
is
all
my
own
and
cherries
roses
and
honey
here
i
will
sit
a
king
on
my
throne
so
jolly
and
funny
a
little
snake
crept
out
of
a
tree
and
cherries
roses
and
honey
lie
down
at
my
feet
little
snake
said
he
so
jolly
and
funny
a
little
bird
sang
in
the
tree
overhead
apples
and
cherries
roses
and
honey
come
and
sing
your
song
on
my
finger
he
said
so
jolly
and
up
coiled
the
snake
the
bird
came
down
and
sang
him
the
song
of
birdie
brown
but
little
boy
blue
found
it
tiresome
to
sit
though
it
was
on
a
throne
he
would
walk
a
bit
he
took
up
his
horn
and
he
blew
a
blast
snake
you
go
first
and
birdie
come
last
waves
of
green
snake
the
yellow
leaves
went
the
snake
led
the
way
and
he
knew
what
he
meant
but
by
boy
blue
head
with
flutter
and
dart
flew
birdie
brown
her
song
in
her
heart
boy
blue
came
where
apples
grew
fair
and
sweet
tree
drop
me
an
apple
down
at
my
feet
he
came
where
cherries
hung
plump
and
red
come
to
my
mouth
sweet
kisses
he
said
and
the
boughs
bow
down
and
the
apples
they
dapple
the
grass
too
many
for
him
to
grapple
and
the
cheeriest
cherries
with
never
a
miss
fall
to
his
mouth
each
a
kiss
he
met
a
little
brook
singing
a
song
little
brook
he
said
you
are
going
wrong
you
must
follow
me
follow
me
follow
i
say
do
as
i
tell
you
and
come
this
way
and
the
forest
brook
leapt
from
its
bed
and
after
him
took
and
the
dead
leaves
rustled
yellow
and
wan
as
over
their
beds
the
water
ran
he
called
every
bird
that
sat
on
a
bough
he
called
every
creature
with
poop
and
prow
i
mean
with
two
ends
that
is
nose
and
tail
with
legs
or
without
they
followed
full
sail
squirrels
that
carried
their
tails
like
a
sack
each
his
own
on
his
little
brown
humpy
back
snails
that
drew
their
own
caravans
poking
out
their
own
eyes
on
the
point
of
a
lance
and
houseless
slugs
white
black
and
red
snails
too
lazy
to
build
a
shed
and
butterflies
flutterbys
weasels
and
larks
and
owls
and
and

cockchafers
henchafers
cockroaches
henroaches
cuckoos
in
herds
the
dappled
fawns
fawning
the
following
the
swallows
and
flies
flying
and
swallowing
all
went
flitting
and
sailing
and
flowing
after
the
merry
boy
running
and
blowing
the
spider
forgot
and
followed
him
spinning
and
lost
all
his
thread
from
end
to
beginning
the
gay
wasp
forgot
his
rings
and
his
waist
he
never
had
made
such
undignified
haste
the
melted
to
mist
with
their
hurrying
the
mole
forsook
his
harrowing
and
burrowing
the
bees
went
buzzing
not
busy
but
beesy
and
the
midges
in
columns
upright
and
easy
but
little
boy
blue
was
not
content
calling
for
followers
still
as
he
went
blowing
his
horn
and
beating
his
drum
and
crying
aloud
come
all
of
you
come
he
said
to
the
shadows
come
after
me
and
the
shadows
began
to
flicker
and
flee
and
away
through
the
wood
went
flattering
and
fluttering
shaking
and
quivering
quavering
and
muttering
he
said
to
the
wind
come
follow
come
follow
with
whistle
and
pipe
with
rustle
and
hollo
and
the
wind
wound
round
at
his
desire
as
if
boy
had
been
the
gold
cock
on
the
spire
and
the
cock
itself
flew
down
from
the
church
and
left
the
farmers
all
in
the
lurch
everything
everything
all
and
sum
they
run
and
they
fly
they
creep
and
they
come
the
very
trees
they
tugged
at
their
roots
only
their
feet
were
too
fast
in
their
boots
after
him
leaning
and
straining
and
bending
as
on
through
their
boles
the
army
kept
wending
till
out
of
the
wood
boy
burst
on
a
lea
shouting
and
calling
come
after
me
and
then
they
rose
with
a
leafy
hiss
and
stood
as
if
nothing
had
been
amiss
little
boy
blue
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
the
creatures
came
round
him
every
one
he
said
to
the
clouds
i
want
you
there
and
down
they
sank
through
the
thin
blue
air
he
said
to
the
sunset
far
in
the
west
come
here
i
want
you
is
my
behest
and
the
sunset
came
and
stood
up
on
the
wold
and
burned
and
glowed
in
purple
and
gold
then
little
boy
blue
began
to
ponder
what
to
be
done
with
them
all
i
wonder
he
thought
a
while
then
he
said
quite
low
what
to
do
with
you
all
i
am
sure
i
do
know
the
clouds
clodded
down
till
dismal
it
grew
the
snake
sneaked
close
round
birdie
brown
flew
the
brook
like
a
cobra
rose
on
its
tail
and
the
wind
sank
down
with
a
wail
and
all
the
creatures
sat
and
stared
the
mole
opened
the
eyes
that
he
had
and
glared
and
for
rats
and
bats
and
the
world
and
his
wife
little
boy
blue
was
afraid
of
his
life
then
birdie
brown
began
to
sing
and
what
he
sang
was
the
very
thing
little
boy
blue
you
have
brought
us
all
hither
pray
are
we
to
sit
and
grow
old
together
go
away
go
away
said
little
boy
blue
i
sure
i
do
want
you
get
away
do
no
no
no
no
no
yes
and
no
no
sang
birdie
brown
it
must
be
so
if
we
come
for
no
good
we
ca
go
away
give
us
reason
for
going
or
here
we
stay
they
covered
the
earth
they
darkened
the
air
they
hovered
they
sat
with
a
countless
stare
if
i
do
not
give
them
something
to
do
they
will
stare
me
up
said
little
boy
blue
oh
dear
oh
dear
he
began
to
cry
they
an
awful
crew
and
i
feel
so
shy
all
of
a
sudden
he
thought
of
a
thing
and
up
he
stood
and
spoke
like
a
king
you
the
plague
of
my
life
have
done
with
your
bother
off
with
you
all
take
me
back
to
my
mother
the
sunset
went
back
to
the
gates
of
the
west
follow
sang
birdie
i
know
the
way
best
i
am
going
the
same
way
as
fast
as
i
can
said
the
brook
as
it
sank
and
turned
and
ran
to
the
wood
fled
the
shadows
like
scared
black
ghosts
if
we
stay
we
shall
all
be
missed
from
our
posts
said
the
wind
with
a
voice
that
had
changed
its
cheer
i
was
just
going
there
when
you
brought
me
here
that
where
i
live
said
the
squirrel
and
he
turned
his
sack
with
a
swing
and
a
swirl
said
the
gold
i
the
churchwarden
said
the
mole
i
live
in
the
parson
garden
said
they
all
if
that
where
you
want
us
to
steer
for
what
on
earth
or
in
air
did
you
bring
us
here
for
you
are
none
the
worse
said
boy
if
you
do
as
i
tell
you
why
then
do
i
leave
you
behind
and
go
home
without
you
and
it
time
i
did
i
begin
to
doubt
you
he
jumped
to
his
feet
the
snake
rose
on
his
tail
and
hissed
three
times
a
hiss
full
of
bale
and
shot
out
his
tongue
at
boy
blue
to
scare
him
and
stared
at
him
out
of
his
courage
to
stare
him
you
ugly
snake
little
boy
blue
said
get
out
of
my
way
or
i
break
your
head
the
snake
would
not
move
but
glared
at
him
glum
boy
blue
hit
him
hard
with
the
stick
of
his
drum
the
snake
fell
down
as
if
he
was
dead
little
boy
blue
set
his
foot
on
his
head
hurrah
cried
the
creatures
hurray
hurrah
little
boy
blue
your
will
is
a
law
and
away
they
went
marching
before
him
and
marshalled
him
home
with
a
high
cockolorum
and
birdie
brown
sang

in
the
fun
he
has
found
the
earnest
i
is

wrong
the
wish
to
be
great
for
i
do
wish
it
so
i
have
asked
already
my
sister
kate
she
says
she
does
not
know
yestereve
at
the
gate
i
stood
watching
the
sun
in
the
west
when
i
saw
him
look
so
grand
and
good
it
swelled
up
in
my
breast
next
from
the
rising
moon
it
stole
like
a
silver
dart
in
the
night
when
the
wind
began
his
tune
it
woke
with
a
sudden
start
this
morning
a
trumpet
blast
made
all
the
cottage
quake
it
came
so
sudden
and
shook
so
fast
it
blew
me
wide
awake
it
told
me
i
must
make
haste
and
some
great
glory
win
for
every
day
was
running
to
waste
and
at
once
i
must
begin
i
want
to
be
great
and
strong
i
want
to
begin
but
if
you
think
it
very
wrong
i
will
send
the
wish
away
ii
father
wrong
to
wish
to
be
great
no
willie
it
is
not
wrong
the
child
who
stands
at
the
high
closed
gate
must
wish
to
be
tall
and
strong
if
you
did
not
wish
to
grow
i
should
be
a
sorry
man
i
should
think
my
boy
was
dull
and
slow
nor
worthy
of
his
clan
you
are
bound
to
be
great
my
boy
wish
and
get
up
and
do
were
you
content
to
be
little
my
joy
would
be
little
enough
in
you
papa
papa
i
so
glad
that
what
i
wish
is
right
i
will
not
lose
a
chance
to
be
had
i
begin
this
very
night
i
will
work
so
hard
at
school
i
will
waste
no
time
in
play
at
my
fingers
ends
i
have
every
rule
for
knowledge
is
power
they
say
i
be
a
king
and
reign
but
i
ca
be
that
and
so
i
be
i
think
and
gain
sharp
battles
and
sieges
slow
i
shall
gallop
and
shout
and
call
waving
my
shining
sword
artillery
cavalry
infantry
all
hear
and
obey
my
word
or
admiral
i
will
be
wherever
the
salt
wave
runs
sailing
fighting
over
the
sea
with
flashing
and
roaring
guns
i
will
make
myself
hardy
and
strong
i
will
never
never
give
in
i
so
glad
it
is
not
wrong
at
once
i
will
begin
father
fighting
and
shining
along
all
for
the
show
of
the
thing
any
puppet
will
mimic
the
grand
and
strong
if
you
pull
the
proper
string
but
indeed
i
want
to
great
i
should
despise
mere
show
the
thing
i
want
is
the
above
the
rest
you
know
father
the
harder
you
run
that
race
the
farther
you
tread
that
track
the
greatness
you
fancy
before
your
face
is
the
farther
behind
your
back
to
be
up
in
the
heavens
afar
miles
above
all
the
rest
would
make
a
star
not
the
greatest
star
only
the
dreariest
that
book
on
the
highest
shelf
is
not
the
greatest
book
if
you
would
be
great
it
must
be
in
yourself
neither
by
place
nor
look
the
highest
is
not
high
by
being
higher
than
others
to
greatness
you
come
not
a
step
more
nigh
by
getting
above
your
brothers
iii
i
meant
the
boys
at
school
i
did
not
mean
my
brother
somebody
first
is
there
the
rule
it
must
be
me
or
another
father
oh
willie
it
all
the
same
they
are
your
brothers
all
for
when
you
say
hallowed
be
thy
name
whose
father
is
it
you
call
could
you
pray
for
such
rule
to
do
you
think
that
he
would
hear
must
he
favour
one
in
a
greedy
whim
where
all
are
his
children
dear
it
is
right
to
get
up
and
do
but
why
outstrip
the
rest
why
should
one
of
the
many
be
one
of
the
few
why
should
think
to
be
best
then
how
am
i
to
be
great
i
know
no
other
way
it
would
be
folly
to
sit
and
wait
i
must
up
and
do
you
say
father
i
do
not
want
you
to
wait
for
few
before
they
die
have
got
so
far
as
begin
to
be
great
the
lesson
is
so
high
i
will
tell
you
the
only
plan
to
climb
and
not
to
fall
he
who
would
rise
and
be
greater
than
he
is
must
be
servant
of
all
turn
it
each
way
in
your
mind
try
every
other
plan
you
may
think
yourself
great
but
at
length
you
find
you
are
not
even
a
man
climb
to
the
top
of
the
trees
climb
to
the
top
of
the
hill
get
up
on
the
crown
of
the
sky
if
you
please
you
be
a
small
creature
still
be
admiral
poet
or
king
let
praises
fill
both
your
ears
your
soul
will
be
but
a
windmill
thing
blown
round
by
its
hopes
and
fears
iv
then
put
me
in
the
way
for
you
papa
are
a
man
what
thing
shall
i
do
this
very
day
only
be
sure
i
i
want
to
know
i
am
willing
let
me
at
least
have
a
chance
shall
i
give
the
my
shilling
i
want
to
serve
at
once
father
give
all
your
shillings
you
might
and
hurt
your
brothers
the
more
he
only
can
serve
his
fellows
aright
who
goes
in
at
the
little
door
we
must
do
the
thing
we
before
the
thing
we
we
are
unfit
for
any
trust
till
we
can
and
do
obey
i
will
try
more
and
more
i
have
nothing
now
to
ask
i
know
is
the
little
door
now
set
me
some
hard
task
father
no
willie
the
father
of
all
teacher
and
master
high
has
set
your
task
beyond
recall
nothing
can
set
it
by
what
is
it
father
dear
that
he
would
have
me
do
i
ask
himself
but
he
not
near
and
so
i
must
ask
you
father
me
is
no
use
to
ask
i
too
am
one
of
his
boys
but
he
tells
each
boy
his
own
plain
task
listen
and
hear
his
voice
father
i
listening
to
hear
him
if
i
may
his
voice
must
either
be
very
low
or
very
far
away
father
it
is
neither
hard
to
hear
nor
hard
to
understand
it
is
very
low
but
very
near
a
still
small
strong
command
i
do
not
hear
it
at
all
i
am
only
hearing
you
father
think
is
there
nothing
great
or
small
you
ought
to
go
and
do
let
me
think
i
ought
to
feed
my
rabbits
i
went
away
in
such
a
hurry
this
morning
indeed
they
not
had
enough
father
that
is
his
whisper
low
that
is
his
very
word
you
had
only
to
stop
and
listen
and
so
very
plainly
you
heard
that
duty
the
little
door
you
must
open
it
and
go
in
there
is
nothing
else
to
do
before
there
is
nowhere
else
to
begin
but
that
so
easily
done
it
such
a
trifling
affair
so
nearly
over
as
soon
as
begun
for
that
he
can
hardly
care
father
you
are
turning
from
his
call
if
you
let
that
duty
wait
you
would
not
think
any
duty
small
if
you
yourself
were
great
the
nearest
is
at
life
core
with
the
first
you
all
begin
what
matter
how
little
the
little
door
if
it
only
let
you
in
papa
i
am
come
again
it
is
now
three
months
and
more
that
i
tried
to
do
the
thing
that
was
plain
and
i
feel
as
small
as
before
father
your
honour
comes
too
slow
how
much
then
have
you
done
one
foot
on
a
would
you
crow
as
if
you
had
reached
the
sun
but
i
can
not
help
a
doubt
whether
this
way
be
the
true
the
more
i
do
to
work
it
out
the
more
there
comes
to
do
and
yet
were
all
done
and
past
i
should
feel
just
as
small
for
when
i
had
tried
to
the
very
last
was
my
duty
after
all
it
is
only
much
the
same
as
not
being
liar
or
thief
father
one
who
tried
it
found
even
with
shame
that
of
sinners
he
was
the
chief
my
boy
i
am
glad
indeed
you
have
been
finding
the
truth
but
where
the
good
i
shall
never
speed
be
one
whit
greater
in
sooth
if
duty
itself
must
fail
and
that
be
the
only
plan
how
shall
my
scarce
begun
duty
prevail
to
make
me
a
mighty
man
father
ah
willie
what
if
it
were
quite
another
way
to
fall
what
if
the
greatness
itself
lie
there
in
knowing
that
you
are
small
in
seeing
the
good
so
good
that
you
feel
poor
weak
and
low
and
hungrily
long
for
it
as
for
food
with
an
endless
need
to
grow
the
man
who
was
lord
of
fate
born
in
an
ox
stall
was
great
because
he
was
much
too
great
to
care
about
greatness
at
all
ever
and
only
he
sought
the
will
of
his
father
good
never
of
what
was
high
he
thought
but
of
what
his
father
would
you
long
to
be
great
you
try
you
feel
yourself
smaller
still
in
the
name
of
god
let
ambition
die
let
him
make
you
what
he
will
who
does
the
truth
is
one
with
the
living
truth
above
be
god
obedient
little
son
let
ambition
die
in
love
king
cole
he
reigned
in
aureoland
but
the
sceptre
was
seldom
in
his
hand
far
oftener
was
there
his
golden
cup
he
ate
too
much
but
he
drank
all
up
to
be
called
a
king
and
to
be
a
king
that
is
one
thing
and
another
thing
so
his
majesty
head
began
to
shake
and
his
hands
and
his
feet
to
swell
and
ache
the
doctors
were
called
but
they
dared
not
say
your
majesty
drinks
too
much
tokay
so
out
of
the
king
heart
died
all
mirth
and
he
thought
there
was
nothing
good
on
earth
then
up
rose
the
fool
whose
every
word
was
three
parts
wise
and
one
part
absurd
nuncle
he
said
never
mind
the
gout
i
will
make
you
laugh
till
you
laugh
it
out
king
cole
pushed
away
his
full
gold
plate
the
jester
he
opened
the
palace
gate
brought
in
a
cold
man
with
hunger
grim
and
on
the
seated
him
then
caught
up
the
king
own
golden
plate
and
set
it
beside
him
oh
how
he
ate
and
the
king
took
note
with
a
pleased
surprise
that
he
ate
with
his
mouth
and
his
cheeks
and
his
eyes
with
his
arms
and
his
legs
and
his
body
whole
and
laughed
aloud
from
his
heart
and
soul
then
from
his
lordly
chair
got
up
and
carried
the
man
his
own
gold
cup
the
goblet
was
deep
and
wide
and
full
the
poor
man
drank
like
a
cow
at
a
pool
said
the
king
to
the
jester
i
call
it
well
done
to
drink
with
two
mouths
instead
of
one
said
the
king
to
himself
as
he
took
his
seat
it
is
quite
as
good
to
feed
as
to
eat
it
is
better
i
do
begin
to
think
to
give
to
the
thirsty
than
to
drink
and
now
i
have
thought
of
it
said
the
king
there
might
be
more
of
this
kind
of
thing
the
fool
heard
the
king
had
not
long
to
wait
the
fool
cried
aloud
at
the
the
ragged
and
wretched
the
hungry
and
thin
loose
in
their
clothes
and
tight
in
their
skin
gathered
in
shoals
till
they
filled
the
hall
and
the
king
and
the
fool
they
fed
them
all
and
as
with
good
things
their
plates
they
piled
the
king
grew
merry
as
a
little
child
on
the
morrow
early
he
went
abroad
and
sought
poor
folk
in
their
own
abode
sought
them
till
evening
foggy
and
dim
did
not
wait
till
they
came
to
him
and
every
day
after
did
what
he
could
gave
them
work
and
gave
them
food
thus
he
made
war
on
the
wintry
weather
and
his
health
and
the
spring
came
back
together
but
lo
a
change
had
passed
on
the
king
like
the
change
of
the
world
in
that
same
spring
his
face
had
grown
noble
and
good
to
see
and
the
crown
sat
well
on
his
majesty
now
he
ate
enough
and
ate
no
more
he
drank
about
half
what
he
drank
before
he
reigned
a
real
king
in
aureoland
reigned
with
his
head
and
his
heart
and
his
hand
all
this
through
the
fool
did
come
to
pass
and
every
that
was
the
stood
open
wide
and
the
poor
came
in
from
every
side
and
the
king
rose
up
and
served
them
duly
and
his
people
loved
him
very
truly
and
said
the
boy
as
he
read
i
too
will
be
bold
i
will
fight
for
the
truth
and
its
glory
he
went
to
the
playground
and
soon
had
told
a
very
cowardly
story
said
the
girl
as
she
read
that
was
grand
i
declare
what
a
true
what
a
lovely
sweet
soul
in
she
went
up
the
stair
looking
as
black
as
a
coal
the
mean
little
wretch
i
wish
i
could
fling
this
book
at
his
head
said
another
then
he
went
and
did
the
same
ugly
thing
to
his
own
little
trusting
brother
alas
for
him
who
sees
a
thing
grand
and
does
not
fit
himself
to
it
but
the
meanest
act
on
sea
or
on
land
is
to
find
a
fault
and
then
do
it
doddridge
what
you
doddridge
dog
and
not
know
who
made
you
my
little
dog
who
blessed
you
with
such
white
and
who
was
it
that
dressed
you
in
such
a
lot
of
legs
perhaps
he
never
told
you
perhaps
you
know
quite
well
and
beg
me
not
to
scold
you
for
you
ca
speak
to
tell
i
tell
you
little
brother
in
case
you
do
not
know
one
only
not
another
could
make
us
two
just
so
you
love
me
quiet
i
proving
it
must
be
god
above
that
filled
those
eyes
with
loving
he
was
the
first
to
love
one
day
he
stop
all
sadness
hark
to
the
nightingale
oh
blessed
god
of
gladness
come
doggie
wag
your
tail
that
thank
you
god
he
gave
you
of
life
this
little
taste
and
with
more
life
he
save
you
not
let
you
go
to
waste
he
says
now
live
together
and
share
your
bite
and
sup
and
then
he
say
come
hither
and
lift
us
both
high
up
girl
that
lost
there
was
a
girl
that
lost
things
nor
only
from
her
hand
she
lost
indeed
why
most
things
as
if
they
had
been
sand
she
said
but
i
must
use
them
and
ca
look
after
all
indeed
i
did
not
lose
them
i
only
let
them
fall
that
how
she
lost
her
thimble
it
fell
upon
the
floor
her
eyes
were
very
nimble
but
she
never
saw
it
more
and
then
she
lost
her
dolly
her
very
doll
of
all
that
loss
was
far
from
jolly
but
worse
things
did
befall
she
lost
a
ring
of
pearls
with
a
ruby
in
them
set
but
the
dearest
girl
of
girls
cried
only
did
not
fret
and
then
she
lost
her
robin
ah
that
was
sorrow
dire
he
hopped
along
and
bob
in
hopped
bob
into
the
fire
and
once
she
lost
a
kiss
as
she
came
down
the
stair
but
that
she
did
not
miss
for
sure
it
was
somewhere
just
then
she
lost
her
heart
too
but
did
so
well
without
it
she
took
that
in
good
part
too
and
said
not
much
about
it
but
when
she
lost
her
health
she
did
feel
rather
poor
till
in
came
loads
of
wealth
by
quite
another
door
and
soon
she
lost
a
dimple
that
was
upon
her
cheek
but
that
was
very
simple
she
was
so
thin
and
weak
and
then
she
lost
her
mother
and
thought
that
she
was
dead
sure
there
was
not
another
on
whom
to
lay
her
head
and
then
she
lost
her
self
but
that
she
threw
away
and
god
upon
his
shelf
it
carefully
did
lay
and
then
she
lost
her
sight
and
lost
all
hope
to
find
it
but
a
of
light
came
flashing
up
behind
it
at
last
she
lost
the
world
in
a
black
and
stormy
wind
away
from
her
it
whirled
but
the
loss
how
could
she
mind
for
with
it
she
lost
her
losses
her
aching
and
her
weeping
her
pains
and
griefs
and
crosses
and
all
things
not
worth
keeping
it
left
her
with
the
lost
things
her
heart
had
still
been
craving
them
she
found
why
most
things
and
all
things
worth
the
saving
she
found
her
precious
mother
who
not
the
least
had
died
and
then
she
found
that
other
whose
heart
had
hers
inside
and
next
she
found
the
kiss
she
lost
upon
the
stair
sweeter
far
i
guess
for
ripening
in
that
air
she
found
her
self
all
mended
and
strong
and
white
she
found
her
health
with
a
radiant
delight
she
found
her
little
robin
he
made
his
wings
go
flap
came
fluttering
and
went
bob
in
went
bob
into
her
lap
so
girls
that
can
not
keep
things
be
patient
till
and
mind
you
do
beweep
things
that
are
not
worth
such
sorrow
for
the
father
great
of
fathers
of
mothers
girls
and
boys
in
his
arms
his
children
gathers
and
sees
to
all
their
toys
i
will
think
as
thinks
the
rabbit
oh
delight
in
the
night
when
the
moon
sets
the
tune
to
the
woods
and
the
broods
all
run
out
frisk
about
go
and
come
beat
the
drum
here
in
groups

in
troops
now
there

none
and
now
they
are
dancing
like
chaff

look
and
i
laugh
but

by
my
door
and
keep
to
my
habit
a
wise
respectable
old
rabbit

in
with
a

into
the
dry
warm
sand
our
family
white
tails
the
last
of
our
vitals
following
hard
with
a
whisk
to
them
and
with
a
great
sense
of
risk
to
them
hear
to
it
pouring
hear
the
thunder
roaring
far
off
and
up
high
while
we
all
lie
so
warm
and
so
dry
in
the
mellow
dark
where
never
a
spark
white
or
rosy
or
blue
of
the
sheeting
fleeting
forking
frightening
lashing
lightning
ever
can
come
through
let
the
wind
chafe
in
the
trees
overhead
we
are
quite
safe
in
our
dark
yellow
bed
let
the
rain
pour
it
never
can
bore
a
hole
in
our
roof
it
is
waterproof
so
is
the
cloak
we
always
carry
we
furry
folk
in
sandhole
or
quarry
it
is
perfect
bliss
to
lie
in
a
nest
so
soft
as
this
all
so
warmly
drest
no
one
to
flurry
you
no
one
to
hurry
you
no
one
to
scurry
you
holes
plenty
to
creep
in
all

to
sleep
in
all
night
to
roam
in
gray
dawn
to
run
home
in
and
all
the
days
and
nights
to
come
after
all
the
for
and
laughter
now
the
rain
is
over
we
are
out
again

merry
leaping
rover
on
his

strong
as
thou
wilt
be
make
us
always
know
and
see
we
are
his
as
well
as
thou
end
of
there
is
a
river
whose
waters
run
asleep
run
run
ever
singing
in
the
shallows
dumb
in
the
hollows
sleeping
so
deep
and
all
the
swallows
that
dip
their
feathers
in
the
hollows
or
in
the
shallows
are
the
merriest
swallows
and
the
nests
they
make
with
the
clay
they
cake
with
the
water
they
shake
from
their
wings
that
rake
the
water
out
of
the
shallows
or
out
of
the
hollows
will
hold
together
in
any
weather
and
the
swallows
are
the
merriest
fellows
and
have
the
merriest
children
and
are
built
very
narrow
like
the
head
of
an
arrow
to
cut
the
air
and
go
just
where
the
nicest
water
is
flowing
and
the
nicest
dust
is
blowing
and
each
so
narrow
like
the
head
of
an
arrow
is
a
wonderful
barrow
to
carry
the
mud
he
makes
for
his
children
sakes
from
the
wet
water
flowing
and
the
dry
dust
blowing
to
build
his
nest
for
her
he
loves
best
and
the
wind
cakes
it
the
sun
bakes
it
into
a
nest
for
the
rest
of
her
he
loves
best
and
all
their
merry
children
each
little
fellow
with
a
beak
as
yellow
as
the
buttercups
growing
beside
the
flowing
of
the
singing
river
always
and
ever
growing
and
blowing
as
fast
as
the
sheep
awake
or
asleep
crop
them
and
crop
and
can
not
stop
their
yellowness
blowing
nor
yet
the
growing
of
the
obstinate
daisies
the
little
white
praises
they
grow
and
they
blow
they
spread
out
their
crown
and
they
praise
the
sun
and
when
he
goes
down
their
praising
is
done
they
fold
up
their
crown
and
sleep
every
one
till
over
the
plain
he
is
shining
amain
and
they
at
it
again
praising
and
praising
such
low
songs
raising
that
no
one
can
hear
them
but
the
sun
so
near
them
and
the
sheep
that
bite
them
but
do
not
fright
them
are
the
quietest
sheep
awake
or
asleep
with
the
merriest
bleat
and
the
little
lambs
are
the
merriest
lambs
forgetting
to
eat
for
the
frolic
in
their
feet
and
the
lambs
and
their
dams
are
the
whitest
sheep
with
the
woolliest
wool
for
the
swallow
to
pull
when
he
makes
his
nest
for
her
he
loves
best
and
they
shine
like
snow
in
the
grasses
that
grow
by
the
singing
river
that
sings
for
ever
and
the
sheep
and
the
lambs
are
merry
for
ever
because
the
river
sings
and
they
drink
it
and
the
lambs
and
their
dams
would
any
one
think
it
are
bright
and
white
because
of
their
diet
which
gladdens
them
quiet
for
what
they
bite
is
buttercups
yellow
and
daisies
white
and
grass
as
green
as
the
river
can
make
it
with
wind
as
mellow
to
kiss
it
and
shake
it
as
never
was
known
but
here
in
the
hollows
beside
the
river
where
all
the
swallows
are
the
merriest
fellows
and
the
nests
they
make
with
the
clay
they
cake
in
the
sunshine
bake
till
they
are
like
bone
and
as
dry
in
the
wind
as
a
marble
stone
dried
in
the
wind
the
sweetest
wind
that
blows
by
the
river
flowing
for
ever
and
who
shall
find
whence
comes
the
wind
that
blows
on
the
hollows
and
over
the
shallows
where
dip
the
swallows
and
comes
and
goes
and
the
sweet
life
blows
into
the
river
that
sings
as
it
flows
and
the
sweet
life
blows
into
the
sheep
awake
or
asleep
with
the
woolliest
wool
and
the
trailingest
tails
and
never
fails
gentle
and
cool
to
wave
the
wool
and
to
toss
the
grass
as
the
lambs
and
the
sheep
over
it
pass
and
tug
and
bite
with
their
teeth
so
white
and
then
with
the
sweep
of
their
trailing
tails
smooth
it
again
and
it
grows

and
amain
it
grows
and
the
wind
that
blows
tosses
the
swallows
over
the
hollows
and
over
the
shallows
and
blows
the
sweet
life
and
the
joy
so
rife
into
the
swallows
that
skim
the
shallows
and
have
the
yellowest
children
and
the
wind
that
blows
is
the
life
of
the
river
that
flows
for
ever
and
washes
the
grasses
still
as
it
passes
and
feeds
the
daisies
the
little
white
praises
and
buttercups
sunny
with
butter
and
honey
that
whiten
the
sheep
awake
or
asleep
that
nibble
and
bite
and
grow
whiter
than
white
and
merry
and
quiet
on
such
good
diet
watered
by
the
river
and
tossed
for
ever
by
the
wind
that
tosses
the
wool
and
the
grasses
and
the
swallow
that
crosses
with
all
the
swallows
over
the
shallows
dipping
their
wings
to
gather
the
water
and
bake
the
cake
for
the
wind
to
make
as
hard
as
a
bone
and
as
dry
as
a
stone
and
who
shall
find
whence
comes
the
wind
that
blows
from
behind
and
ripples
the
river
that
flows
for
ever
and
still
as
it
passes
waves
the
grasses
and
cools
the
daisies
the
white
sun
praises
that
feed
the
sheep
awake

asleep
and
give
them
their
wool
for
the
swallows
to
pull
a
little
away
to
mix
with
the
clay
that
cakes
to
a
nest
for
those
they
love
best
and
all
the
yellow
children
soon
to
go
trying
their
wings
at
the
flying
over
the
hollows
and
over
the
shallows
with
all
the
swallows
that
do
not

whence
the
wind
doth
blow

a
drawing
of
thomas

the
american
this
must
be
the
very
night
the
moon
knows
it
and
the
trees
they
stand
straight
upright
each
a
sentinel
drawn
up
as
if
they
dared
not
know
which
way
the
wind
might
blow
the
very
pool
with
dead
gray
eye
dully
expectant
feels
it
nigh
and
begins
to
curdle
and
freeze
and
the
dark
night
with
its
fringe
of
light
holds
the
secret
in
its
cup
ii
what
can
it
be
to
make
the
poplars
cease
to
shiver
and
shake
and
up
in
the
dismal
air
stand
straight
and
stiff
as
the
human
hair
when
the
human
soul
is
dizzy
with
dread
all
but
those
two
that
strain
aside
in
a
frenzy
of
speechless
pain
though
never
a
wind
sends
out
a
breath
to
tunnel
the

in

something
has
gone

a
scream
will
come
tearing
out
ere

iii
still
as
death
although
i
listen
with
bated
breath
yet
something
is
coming
i
know
is
coming
with
an
inward
soundless
humming
somewhere
in
me
or
if
in
the
air
i
can
not
tell
but
it
is
there
marching
on
to
an
unheard
drumming
something
is
coming
coming
growing
and
coming
and
the
moon
is
aware
aghast
in
the
air
at
the
thing
that
is
only
coming
with
an
inward
soundless
humming
and
an
unheard
spectral
drumming
iv
nothing
to
see
and
nothing
to
hear
only
across
the
inner
sky
the
wing
of
a
shadowy
thought
flits
by
vague
and
featureless
faceless
drear
only
a
thinness
to
catch
the
eye
is
it
a
dim
foreboding
unborn
or
a
buried
memory
wasted
and
worn
as
the
fading
frost
of
a
wintry
sigh
anon
i
shall
have
it
anon
it
draws
nigh
a
night
when
a
something
it
was
took
place
that
drove
the
blood
from
that
scared
hark
was
that
the
cry
of
a
goat
or
the
gurgle
of
water
in
a
throat
hush
there
is
nothing
to
see
or
hear
only
a
silent
something
is
near
no
knock
no
footsteps
three
or
four
only
a
presence
outside
the
door
see
the
moon
is
remembering
what
the
wail
of
a
brat
or
a
raven
sharpening
its
beak
to
peck
or
a
cold
blue
knife
and
a
warm
white
neck
or
only
a
heart
that
burst
and
ceased
for
a
man
that
went
away
released
i
know
not
know
not
but
something
is
coming
somehow
back
with
an
inward
humming

look
there
look
at
that
house
forsaken
of
all
things
beetle
and
mouse
mark
how
it
looks
it
must
have
a
soul
it
looks
it
looks
though
it
can
not
stir
see
the
ribs
of
it
how
they
stare
its
blind
eyes
yet
have
a
seeing
air
it
it
has
a
soul
haggard
it
hangs
the
slimy
pool
and
gapes
wide
open
as
corpses
gape
it
is
the
very
murderer
the
ghost
has
modelled
himself
to
the
shape
of
this
drear
house
all
sodden
with
woe
where
the
deed
was
done
long
long
ago
and
filled
with
himself
his
new
body
full
to
haunt
for
ever
his
ghastly
crime
and
see
it
come
and
go
brooding
around
it
like
motionless
time
with
a
mouth
that
gapes
and
eyes
that
yawn
blear
and
blintering
and
full
of
the
moon
like
one
aghast
at
a
hellish
dawn
the
deed
the
deed
it
is
coming
soon
vi
for
ever
and
always
when
round
the
tune
grinds
on
the
barrel
of
the
deed
is
done
and
it
comes
anon
true
to
the
roll
of
the
moon
true
to
the
ring
of
the
spheric
chime
true
to
the
cosmic
rhythm
and
rime
every
point
as
it
first
fell
out
will
come
and
go
in
the
fearsome
bout
see
palsied
with
horror
from
garret
to
core
the
house
can
not
shut
its
gaping
door
its
burst
eye
stares
as
if
trying
to
see
and
it
leans
as
if
settling
heavily
settling
heavy
with
sickness
dull
also
is
hearing
the
soundless
humming
of
the
wheel
that
is
turning
the
thing
that
is
coming
on
the
naked
rafters
of
its
brain
gaunt
and
wintred
see
the
train
of
gossiping
crows
that
watch
all
silent
with
necks
wickedly
knowing
with
heads
awry
and
the
sharpened
gleam
of
a
cunning
eye
watch
through
the
cracks
of
the
ruined
skull
how
the
evil
business
goes
beyond
the
eyes
of
the
cherubim
beyond
the
ears
of
the
seraphim
outside
forsaken
in
the
dim
chaos
grim
he
stands
with
the
deed
going
on
in
him
vii
o
winds
winds
that
lurk
and
peep
under
the
edge
of
the
moony
fringe
o
winds
winds
up
and
sweep
up
and
blow
and
billow
the
air
billow
the
air
with
blow
and
swinge
rend
me
this
ghastly
house
of
groans
rend
and
scatter
the
skeleton
bones
over
the
deserts
and
mountains
bare
blast
and
hurl
and
shiver
aside
nailed
sticks
and
mortared
stones
clear
the
phantom
with
torrent
and
tide
out
of
the
moon
and
out
of
my
brain
that
the
light
may
fall
shadowless
in
again
viii
but
alas
then
the
ghost
mountain
and
coast
would
go
roaming
roaming
and
never
was
swine
that
grubbing
and
talking
with
snork
and
whine
on
gadarene
mountains
had
taken
him
in
but
would
rush
to
the
lake
to
unhouse
the
sin
for
any
charnel
this
ghost
is
too
carnal
there
is
no
volcano
burnt
out
and
cold
whose
very
ashes
are
gray
and
old
but
would
cast
him
forth
in
reviving
flame
to
blister
the
sky
with
a
smudge
of
shame
ix
is
there
no
help
none
anywhere
under
the
earth
or
above
the
air
come
sad
woman
whose
tender
throat
has
a
mouth
that
can
sing
no
note
child
whose
midwife
the
third
grim
fate
shears
in
hand
thy
coming
did
wait
father
with
hair
mother
all
withered
with
love
despair
come
broken
heart
whatever
thou
be
hasten
to
help
this
misery
thou
wast
only
murdered
or
left
forlorn
he
is
a
horror
a
hate
a
scorn
come
if
out
of
the
holiest
blue
that
the
sapphire
throne
shines
through
for
pity
come
though
thy
fair
feet
stand
next
to
the
fling
thy
harp
on
the
hyaline
hurry
thee
down
the
spheres
divine
come
and
drive
those
ravens
away
cover
his
eyes
from
the
pitiless
moon
shadow
his
brain
from
her
stinging
spray
droop
around
him
a
tent
of
love
an
odour
of
grace
a
fanning
dove
walk
through
the
house
with
the
healing
tune
of
gentle
footsteps
banish
the
shape
remorse
calls
up
thyself
to
ape
comfort
him
dear
with
pardon
sweet
cool
his
heart
from
its
burning
heat
with
the
water
of
life
that
laves
the
feet
of
the
throne
of
god
and
the
holy
street
o
god
he
is
but
a
living
blot
yet
he
lives
by
thee
for
if
thou
wast
not
they
would
vanish
together
he
and
his
crime
one
breathing
blown
from
thy
spirit
on
his
would
all
atone
scatter
the
horror
and
bring
relief
in
an
amber
dawn
of
holy
grief
god
give
him
sorrow
arise
from
within
his
primal
being
deeper
than
sin
xi
why
do
i
tremble
a
creature
at
bay
is
but
a
dream
i
drive
it
away
back
comes
my
breath
and
my
heart
again
pumps
the
red
blood
to
my
fainting
brain
released
from
the
nightmare
train
god
is
in
heaven
yes
everywhere
and
love
the
will
kill
despair
to
the
wall
blank
eyeless
space
i
turn
the
picture
face
xii
but
why
is
the
moon
so
bare
up
there
and
why
is
she
so
white
and
why
does
the
moon
so
stare
up
there
strangely
stare
out
of
the
night
why
stand
up
the
poplars
that
still
way
and
why
do
those
two
of
them
start
astray
and
out
of
the
black
why
hangs
the
gray
why
does
it
hang
down
so
i
say
over
that
house
like
a
fringed
pall
where
the
dead
goes
by
in
a
funeral
soul
of
mine
thou
the
reason
canst
divine
into
the
moon
doth
stare
with
pallid
air
thou
and
the
horror
outcast
of
eternal
dark
are
in
nature
same
and
one
and
story
is
not
done
so
let
the
picture
face
thee
from
the
wall
and
let
its
white
moon
stare
the
in
the
winter
flowers
are
springing
in
the
winter
woods
are
green
where
our
banished
birds
are
singing
where
our
summer
sun
is
seen
our
cold
midnights
are
coeval
with
an
evening
and
a
morn
where
the
hold
revel
and
the
spring
is
newly
born
while
the
earth
is
full
of
fighting
while
men
rise
and
curse
their
day
while
the
foolish
strong
are
smiting
and
the
foolish
weak
betray
the
true
hearts
beyond
are
growing
the
brave
spirits
work
alone
where
love
is
blowing
in
a
zone
while
we
can
not
shape
our
living
to
the
beauty
of
our
skies
while
man
wants
and
earth
is
giving
nature
calls
and
man
denies
how
the
old
worlds
round
him
gather
where
their
maker
is
their
sun
how
the
children
know
the
father
where
the
will
of
god
is
done
daily
woven
with
our
story
sounding
far
above
our
strife
is
a
glory
is
a
life
we
can
dream
no
dream
elysian
there
is
no
good
thing
might
be
but
some
angel
has
the
vision
but
some
human
soul
shall
see
is
thy
strait
horizon
dreary
is
thy
foolish
fancy
chill
change
the
feet
that
have
grown
weary
for
the
wings
that
never
will
burst
the
flesh
and
live
the
spirit
haunt
the
beautiful
and
far
thou
hast
all
things
to
inherit
and
a
soul
for
every
star
i
think
i
might
be
weary
of
this
day
that
comes
inevitably
every
year
the
same
when
i
was
young
and
strong
and
gay
the
same
when
i
am
old
and
growing
sere
i
should
grow
weary
of
it
every
year
but
that
thou
comest
to
me
every
day
i
shall
grow
weary
if
thou
every
day
but
come
to
me
lord
of
eternal
life
i
shall
grow
weary
thus
to
watch
and
pray
for
ever
out
of
labour
into
strife
take
everlasting
house
with
me
my
life
and
i
shall
be
this
thou
art
the
eternal
son
and
born
no
day
but
ever
he
the
father
thou
the
son
i
am
his
child
but
being
born
alway
how
long
o
lord
how
long
till
it
be
done
be
thou
from
endless
years
to
years
the
son
and
i
thy
brother
every
day
new
be
welcome
year
with
corn
and
sickle
come
make
poor
the
body
but
make
rich
the
heart
what
man
that
bears
his
sheaves
home
will
heed
the
paint
rubbed
from
his
groaning
cart
nor
leave
behind
thy
fears
and
holy
shames
thy
sorrows
on
the
horizon
hanging
low
gray
gathered
fuel
for
the
when
joyous
in
death
we
go
i
when
in
the
of
the
night
i
waken
at
thy
call
o
lord
the
first
that
troop
my
bark
aboard
are
darksome
imps
that
hate
the
light
whose
tongues
are
arrows
eyes
a
blight
of
wraths
and
cares
a
pirate
horde
though
on
the
of
the
night
it
was
thy
call
that
waked
me
lord
then
i
must
to
my
arms
and
fight
catch
up
my
shield
and
sword
the
words
of
him
who
is
thy
word
nor
cease
till
they
are
put
to
flight
then
in
the
of
the
night
i
turn
and
listen
for
thee
lord
ii
there
comes
no
voice
from
thee
o
lord
across
the
of
the
night
i
lift
my
voice
and
cry
with
might
if
thou
keep
silent
soon
a
horde
of
imps
again
will
swarm
aboard
and
i
shall
be
in
sorry
plight
if
no
voice
come
from
thee
my
lord
across
the
of
the
night
there
comes
no
voice
i
hear
no
word
but
in
my
soul
dawns
something
bright
there
is
no
sea
no
foe
to
fight
thy
heart
and
mine
beat
one
accord
i
need
no
voice
from
thee
o
lord
across
the
of
the
night
heart
thou
must
learn
to
do
without
that
is
the
riches
of
the
poor
their
liberty
is
to
endure
wrap
thou
thine
old
cloak
thee
about
and
carol
loud
and
carol
stout
let
thy
rags
fly
nor
wish
them
fewer
thou
too
must
learn
to
do
without
must
earn
the
riches
of
the
poor
why
thou
only
wear
no
clout
thou
only
walk
in
pure
why
should
thy
step
alone
be
sure
thou
only
free
of
fortune
flout
nay
nay
but
learn
to
go
without
and
so
be
humbly
richly
poor
lighter
and
sweeter
let
your
song
be
and
for
sorrow
oh
cheat
her
with
melody
lord
i
have
laid
my
heart
upon
thy
altar
but
can
not
get
the
wood
to
burn
it
hardly
flares
ere
it
begins
to
falter
and
to
the
dark
return
old
sap
or
dew
makes
damp
the
fuel
in
vain
my
breath
would
flame
provoke

every

the
smoke
is

such

as
you

with

that
is
all
my
heart
why
should
she
take
a
part
in
every
selfish
blot
in
every
greedy
spot
that
now
doth
ache
and
smart
because
she
loves
thee
not
not
not
at
all
poor
heart
thou
art
no
such
of
virtues
no
such
chart
of
highways
though
the
dart
of
love
be
through
thee
shot
why
should
she
not
love
not
thee
poor
pinched
selfish
heart
lord
hear
my
discontent
all
blank
i
stand
a
mirror
polished
by
thy
hand
thy
sun
beams
flash
and
flame
from
me
i
can
not
help
it
here
i
stand
there
he
to
one
of
them
i
can
not
say
go
and
on
yonder
water
play
nor
one
poor
ragged
daisy
can
i
fashion
i
do
not
make
the
words
of
this
my
limping
passion
if
i
should
say
now
i
will
think
a
thought
lo
i
must
wait
unknowing
what
thought
in
me
is
growing
until
the
thing
to
birth
be
brought
nor
know
i
then
what
next
will
come
from
out
the
gulf
of
silence
dumb
i
am
the
door
the
thing
will
find
to
pass
into
the
general
mind
i
can
not
say
i
only
stand
upon
the
brink
from
darkness
to
the
sun
the
water
bubbles
up
lift
it
in
my
cup
thou
only
thinkest
i
am
thought
me
and
my
thought
thou
thinkest
nought
am
i
but
as
a
fountain
spout
from
which
thy
water
welleth
out
thou
art
the
only
one
the
all
in
yet
when
my
soul
on
thee
doth
call
and
thou
dost
answer
out
of
everywhere
i
in
thy
allness
have
my
perfect
share
some
men
there
are
who
can
not
spare
a
single
tear
until
they
feel
the
last
cold
pressure
and
the
heel
is
stamped
upon
the
outmost
layer
and
waking
some
will
sigh
to
think
the
clouds
have
borrowed
winter
wing
sad
winter
when
the
grasses
spring
no
more
about
the
fountain
brink
and
some
would
call
me
coward
fool
i
lay
a
claim
to
better
blood
but
yet
a
heap
of
idle
mud
hath
power
to
make
me
sorrowful
my
mother
earth
earth
earth
i
am
dying
for
love
of
thee
for
thou
hast
given
me
birth
and
thy
hands
have
tended
me
i
would
fall
asleep
on
thy
breast
when
its
swelling
folds
are
bare
when
the
thrush
dreams
of
its
nest
and
the
life
of
its
joy
in
the
air
when
thy
life
is
a
vanished
ghost
and
the
glory
hath
left
thy
waves
when
thine
eye
is
blind
with
frost
and
the
fog
sits
on
the
graves
when
the
blasts
are
shivering
about
and
the
rain
thy
branches
beats
when
the
damps
of
death
are
out
and
the
mourners
are
in
the
streets
oh
my
sleep
should
be
deep
in
the
arms
of
thy
swiftening
motion
and
my
dirge
the
mystic
sweep
of
the
winds
that
nurse
the
ocean
and
my
eye
would
slowly
ope
with
the
voice
that
awakens
thee
and
runs
like
a
glance
of
hope
up
through
the
quickening
tree
when
the
roots
of
the
lonely
fir
are
dipt
in
thy
veining
heat
and
thy
countless
atoms
stir
with
the
gather
of
mossy
feet
when
the
sun
great
censer
swings
in
the
hands
that
always
be
and
the
mists
from
thy
watery
rings
go
up
like
dust
from
the
sea
when
the
midnight
airs
are
assembling
with
a
gush
in
thy
whispering
halls
and
the
leafy
air
is
trembling
like
a
stream
before
it
falls
thy
shadowy
hand
hath
found
me
on
the
drifts
of
the
godhead
will
and
thy
dust
hath
risen
around
me
with
a
life
that
guards
me
still
o
earth
i
have
caught
from
thine
the
pulse
of
a
mystic
chase
o
earth
i
have
drunk
like
wine
the
life
of
thy
swiftening
race
wilt
miss
me
mother
sweet
a
life
in
thy
milky
veins
wilt
miss
the
sound
of
my
feet
in
the
tramp
that
shakes
thy
plains
when
the
jaws
of
darkness
rend
and
the
vapours
fold
away
and
the
sounds
of
life
ascend
like
dust
in
the
blinding
day
i
would
know
thy
silver
strain
in
the
shouts
of
the
starry
crowd
when
the
souls
of
thy
changing
men
rise
up
like
an
incense
cloud
i
would
know
thy
brightening
lobes
and
the
lap
of
thy
watery
bars
though
space
were
choked
with
globes
and
the
night
were
blind
with
stars
from
the
folds
of
my
unknown
place
when
my
soul
is
glad
and
free
i
will
slide
by
my
god
sweet
grace
and
hang
like
a
cloud
on
thee
when
the
pale
moon
sits
at
night
by
the
brink
of
her
shining
well
laving
the
rings
of
her
widening
light
on
the
slopes
of
the
weltering
swell
i
will
fall
like
a
wind
from
the
west
on
the
locks
of
thy
prancing
streams
and
sow
the
fields
of
thy
rest
with
handfuls
of
sweet
young
dreams
when
the
sound
of
thy
children
cry
hath
stricken
thy
gladness
dumb
i
will
kindle
thine
upward
eye
with
a
laugh
from
the
years
that
come
far
above
where
the
loud
wind
raves
on
a
wing
as
still
as
snow
i
will
watch
the
grind
of
the
curly
waves
as
they
bite
the
coasts
below
when
the
shining
ranks
of
the
frost
draw
down
on
the
glistening
wold
in
the
mail
of
a
fairy
host
and
the
earth
is
mossed
with
cold
till
the
plates
that
shine
about
close
up
with
a
filmy
din
till
the
air
is
frozen
out
and
the
stars
are
frozen
in
i
will
often
stoop
to
range
on
the
fields
where
my
youth
was
spent
and
my
feet
shall
smite
the
cliffs
of
change
with
the
rush
of
a
steep
descent
and
my
glowing
soul
shall
burn
with
a
love
that
knows
no
pall
and
my
eye
of
worship
turn
upon
him
that
fashioned
all
when
the
sounding
waves
of
strife
have
died
on
the
godhead
sea
and
thy
life
is
a
purer
life
that
nurses
a
life
in
me
make
not
of
thy
heart
a
casket
opening
seldom
quick
to
close
but
of
bread
a
basket
or
a
cup
that
overflows
lord
how
happy
the
german
of
o
lord
how
happy
is
the
time
when
in
thy
love
i
rest
when
from
my
weariness
i
climb
even
to
thy
tender
breast
the
night
of
sorrow
endeth
there
thou
art
brighter
than
the
sun
and
in
thy
pardon
and
thy
care
the
heaven
of
heaven
is
won
let
the
world
call
herself
my
foe
or
let
the
world
allure
i
care
not
for
the
world
i
go
to
this
dear
friend
and
sure
and
when
life
fiercest
storms
are
sent
upon
life
wildest
sea
my
little
bark
is
confident
because
it
holds
by
thee
when
the
law
threatens
endless
death
upon
the
dreadful
hill
straightway
from
her
consuming
breath
my
soul
goeth
higher
still
goeth
to
jesus
wounded
slain
and
maketh
him
her
home
whence
she
will
not
go
out
again
and
where
death
can
not
come
i
do
not
fear
the
wilderness
where
thou
hast
been
before
nay
rather
will
i
daily
press
after
thee
near
thee
more
thou
art
my
food
on
thee
i
lean
thou
makest
my
heart
sing
and
to
thy
heavenly
pastures
green
all
thy
dear
flock
dost
bring
and
if
the
gate
that
opens
there
be
dark
to
other
men
it
is
not
dark
to
those
who
share
the
heart
of
jesus
then
that
is
not
losing
much
of
life
which
is
not
losing
thee
who
art
as
present
in
the
strife
as
in
the
victory
therefore
how
happy
is
the
time
when
in
thy
love
i
rest
when
from
my
weariness
i
climb
even
to
thy
tender
breast
the
night
of
sorrow
endeth
there
thou
art
brighter
than
the
sun
and
in
thy
pardon
and
thy
care
the
heaven
of
heaven
is
won
o
lord
if
on
the
wind
at
cool
of
day
i
heard
one
whispered
word
of
mighty
grace
if
through
the
darkness
as
in
bed
i
lay
but
once
had
come
a
hand
upon
my
face
if
but
one
sign
that
might
not
be
mistook
had
ever
been
since
first
thy
face
i
sought
i
should
not
now
be
doubting
a
book
but
serving
thee
with
burning
heart
and
thought
so
dreams
that
heart
but
to
my
heart
i
say
turning
my
face
to
front
the
dark
and
wind
such
signs
had
only
barred
anew
his
way
into
thee
longing
heart
thee
wildered
mind
they
asked
the
very
way
where
lies
the
way
the
very
son
where
is
the
father
face
how
he
could
show
himself
if
not
in
clay
who
was
the
lord
of
spirit
form
and
space
my
being
lord
will
nevermore
be
whole
until
thou
come
behind
mine
ears
and
eyes
enter
and
fill
the
temple
of
my
soul
with
perfect
contact
such
a
sweet
surprise
such
presence
as
before
it
met
the
view
the
could
not
once
foresee
though
every
corner
of
the
temple
knew
by
very
emptiness
its
need
of
thee
when
i
keep
thy
words
no
favoured
some
heedless
of
worldly
winds
or
judgment
tide
then
jesus
thou
wilt
with
thy
father
come
oh
ended
prayers
and
in
my
soul
abide
ah
long
delay
ah
cunning
creeping
sin
i
shall
but
fail
and
cease
at
length
to
try
o
jesus
though
thou
wilt
not
yet
come
in
knock
at
my
window
as
thou
passest
by
what
dost
thou
here
o
soul
beyond
thy
own
control
under
the
strange
wild
sky
stars
reach
down
your
hands
and
clasp
me
in
your
silver
bands
i
tremble
with
this
mystery
flung
hither
by
a
chance
of
restless
circumstance
thou
art
but
here
and
wast
not
sent
yet
once
more
mayest
thou
draw
by
thy
own
mystic
law
to
the
centre
of
thy
wonderment
why
wilt
thou
stop
and
start
draw
nearer
oh
my
heart
and
i
will
question
thee
most
wistfully
gather
thy
last
clear
resolution
to
look
upon
thy
dissolution
the
great
god
life
throbs
far
and
free
and
thou
art
but
a
spark
known
only
in
thy
dark
or
a
upon
the
awful
ocean
thyself
thy
slender
dignity
thy
own
thy
vexing
mystery
in
the
vast
change
that
is
not
change
but
motion
is
not
so
hard
as
it
would
seem
thy
life
is
but
a
dream
and
yet
thou
hast
some
thoughts
about
the
past
let
go
let
go
thy
memories
they
are
not
things
but
wandering
cries
wave
them
each
one
a
long
farewell
at
last
i
hear
thee
say
take
them
o
tide
and
i
will
turn
aside
gazing
with
heedlessness
nay
even
with
laughter
bind
me
ye
winds
and
storms
among
the
things
that
once
had
forms
and
carry
me
clean
out
of
sight
thereafter
thou
hast
lived
long
enough
to
know
thy
own
weak
stuff
laughing
thy
fondest
joys
to
utter
scorn
give
up
the
idle
strife
it
is
but
mockery
of
life
the
fates
had
need
of
thee
and
thou
wast
born
they
are
in
sooth
but
thou
shalt
die
o
wandering
spark
o
homeless
cry
o
empty
will
still
lacking
look
up
among
the
autumn
trees
the
ripened
fruits
fall
through
the
breeze
and
they
will
shake
thee
even
like
these
into
the
lap
of
an
accomplishment
thou
hadst
a
faith
and
voices
said
doubt
not
truth
but
bend
thy
head
unto
the
god
who
drew
thee
from
the
night
thou
liftedst
up
thy
eyes
and
lo
a
host
of
voices
answered
no
a
thousand
things
as
good
have
seen
the
light
look
how
the
swarms
arise
from
every
clod
before
thy
eyes
are
thine
the
only
hopes
that
fade
and
fall
when
to
the
centre
of
its
action
one
purpose
draws
each
separate
fraction
and
nothing
but
effects
are
left
at
all
aha
thy
faith
what
is
thy
faith
the
sleep
that
waits
on
coming
death
a
blind
delirious
swoon
that
follows
pain
true
to
thy
nature
well
right
well
but
what
that
nature
is
thou
canst
not
tell
it
has
a
thousand
voices
in
thy
brain
danced
all
the
leaflets
to
and
fro
thy
feet
have
trod
them
long
ago
sprung
the
glad
music
up
the
blue
the
hawk
hath
cut
the
song
in
two
all
the
mountains
crumble
all
the
forests
fall
all
thy
brethren
stumble
and
rise
no
more
at
all
in
the
dim
woods
there
is
a
sound
when
the
winds
begin
to
moan
it
is
not
of
joy
or
yet
of
mirth
but
the
mournful
cry
of
our
mother
earth
as
she
calleth
back
her
own
through
the
rosy
air
the
living
creatures
play
up
and
down
through
the
rich
faint
light
none
so
happy
as
they
but
the
blast
is
here
and
noises
fall
like
the
sound
of
steps
in
a
ruined
hall
an
icy
touch
is
upon
them
all
and
they
sicken
and
fade
away
the
child
awoke
with
an
eye
of
gladness
with
a
light
on
his
head
and
a
matchless
grace
and
laughed
at
the
passing
shades
of
sadness
that
chased
the
smiles
on
his
mother
face
and
life
with
its
lightsome
load
of
youth
swam
like
a
boat
on
a
shining
lake
freighted
with
hopes
enough
in
sooth
but
he
lived
to
trample
on
joy
and
truth
and
change
his
crown
for
a
oh
a
ruddy
light
went
through
the
room
till
the
dark
ran
out
to
his
mother
night
and
that
little
chamber
showed
through
the
gloom
like
a
noah
ark
with
its
nest
of
light
right
glad
was
the
maiden
there
i
wis
with
the
youth
that
held
her
hand
in
his
oh
sweet
were
the
words
that
went
and
came
through
the
light
and
shade
of
the
leaping
flame
that
glowed
on
the
cheerful
faces
so
human
the
speech
so
sunny
and
kind
that
the
darkness
danced
on
the
wall
behind
and
even
the
wail
of
the
winter
wind
sang
sweet
through
the
but
a
mournful
wail
crept
round
and
round
and
a
voice
cried
come
with
a
dreary
sound
and
the
circle
wider
grew
the
light
flame
sank
and
sorrow
fell
on
the
faces
of
those
that
loved
so
well
darker
and
wilder
grew
the
tone
fainter
and
fainter
the
faces
shone
the
wild
night
clasped
them
and
they
were
gone
and
thou
art
passing
too
lo
the
morning
slowly
springs
like
a
meek
white
babe
from
the
womb
of
night
one
golden
planet
sits
and
stings
the
shifting
gloom
with
his
point
of
light
lo
the
sun
on
its
throne
of
flame
wouldst
thou
climb
and
win
a
crown
oh
many
a
heart
that
pants
for
the
same
falls
to
the
earth
ere
he
goes
down
thy
heart
is
a
flower
with
an
open
cup
sit
and
watch
if
it
pleaseth
thee
till
the
melting
twilight
fill
it
up
with
a
crystal
of
tender
sympathy
so
gently
will
it
tremble
the
silent
midnight
through
and
flocks
of
stars
assemble
by
turns
in
its
depths
of
dew
but
look
oh
look
again
after
the
driving
wind
and
rain
when
the
day
is
up
and
the
sun
is
strong
and
the
voices
of
men
are
loud
and
long
when
the
flower
hath
slunk
to
its
rest
again
and
love
is
lost
in
the
strife
of
men
let
the
morning
break
with
thoughts
of
love
and
the
evening
fall
with
dreams
of
bliss
so
vainly
panteth
the
prisoned
dove
for
the
depths
of
her
sweet
wilderness
so
stoops
the
eagle
in
his
pride
from
his
rocky
nest
ere
the
bow
is
bent
so
sleeps
the
deer
on
the
ere
the
howling
pack
hath
caught
the
scent
the
fire
climbs
high
till
its
work
is
done
the
stalk
falls
down
when
the
flower
is
gone
and
the
stars
of
heaven
when
their
course
is
run
melt
silently
away
there
was
a
footfall
on
the
snow
a
line
of
light
on
the
and
a
billow
dash
on
the
rocks
below
that
stand
by
the
wintry
bay
the
snow
was
gone
on
the
coming
night
another
wave
arose
in
his
might
uplifted
his
foaming
breast
of
white
and
died
like
the
rest
for
aye
oh
the
stars
were
bright
and
thyself
in
thee
yearned
for
an
immortality
and
the
thoughts
that
drew
from
thy
busy
brain
clasped
the
worlds
like
an
endless
chain
when
a
moon
arose
and
her
moving
chime
smote
on
thy
soul
like
a
word
in
time
or
a
breathless
wish
or
a
thought
in
rime
and
the
truth
that
looked
so
gloomy
and
high
leapt
to
thy
arms
with
a
joyful
cry
but
what
wert
thou
when
a
soulless
cause
opened
the
book
of
its
barren
laws
and
thy
spirit
that
was
so
glad
and
free
was
caught
in
the
gin
of
necessity
and
a
howl
arose
from
the
strife
of
things
vexing
each
other
with
scorpion
stings
what
wert
thou
but
an
orphan
child
thrust
from
the
door
when
the
night
was
wild
or
a
sailor
on
the
toiling
main
looking
blindly
up
through
the
wind
and
rain
as
the
hull
of
the
vessel
fell
in
twain
seals
are
on
the
book
of
fate
hands
may
not
unbind
it
eyes
may
search
for
truth
till
late
but
will
never
find
it
rising
on
the
brow
of
night
like
a
portent
of
dismay
as
the
worlds
in
wild
affright
track
it
on
its
direful
way
resting
like
a
rainbow
bar
where
the
curve
and
level
meet
as
the
children
chase
it
far
the
sands
with
blistered
feet
sadly
through
the
mist
of
ages
gazing
on
this
life
of
fear
doubtful
shining
on
its
pages
only
seen
to
disappear
sit
thee
by
the
sounding
shore
winds
and
waves
of
human
breath
learn
a
lesson
from
their
roar
swelling
bursting
evermore
live
thy
life
and
die
thy
death
die
not
like
the
writhing
worm
rise
and
win
thy
highest
stake
better
perish
in
the
storm
than
sit
rotting
on
the
lake
triumph
in
thy
present
youth
pulse
of
fire
and
heart
of
glee
leap
at
once
into
the
truth
if
there
is
a
truth
for
thee
shapeless
thoughts
and
dull
opinions
slow
distinctions
and
degrees
vex
not
thou
thy
weary
pinions
with
such
leaden
weights
as
these
through
this
mystic
jurisdiction
reaching
out
a
hand
by
chance
resting
on
a
dull
conviction
whetted
but
by
ignorance
living
ever
to
behold
mournful
eyes
that
watch
and
weep
spirit
suns
that
flashed
in
gold
failing
from
the
vasty
deep
starry
lights
that
glowed
like
truth
gazing
with
unnumbered
eyes
melting
from
the
skies
of
youth
swallowed
up
of
mysteries
cords
of
love
that
sweetly
bound
thee
faded
writing
on
thy
brow
presences
that
came
around
thee
hands
of
faith
that
fail
thee
now
groping
hands
will
ever
find
thee
in
the
night
with
loads
of
chains
lift
thy
fetters
and
unbind
thee
cast
thee
on
the
midnight
plains
shapes
of
vision
famished
cheeks
and
hungry
cries
sound
of
crystal
waters
sliding
thirsty
lips
and
bloodshot
eyes
empty
forms
that
send
no
gleaming
through
the
mystery
of
this
strife
oh
in
such
a
life
of
seeming
death
were
worth
an
endless
life
hark
the
trumpet
of
the
ocean
where
glad
lands
were
wont
to
be
many
voices
of
commotion
break
in
tumult
over
thee
lo
they
climb
the
frowning
ages
marching
their
level
lands
far
behind
the
strife
that
rages
silence
sits
with
clasped
hands
undivided
purpose
freeing
his
own
steps
from
hindrances
sending
out
great
floods
of
being
bathes
thy
steps
in
silentness
sit
thee
down
in
mirth
and
laughter
one
there
is
that
waits
for
thee
if
there
is
a
true
hereafter
he
will
lend
thee
eyes
to
see
like
a
snowflake
gently
falling
on
a
quiet
fountain
or
a
weary
echo
calling
from
a
distant
mountain
drop
thy
hands
in
peace
fail
falter
cease
one
who
died
in
loosener
of
springs
he
died
by
thee
softness
not
hardness
sent
him
home
he
loved
thee
and
thou
him
free
of
all
the
place
thou
comest
from
autumn
are
the
leaves
falling
round
about
the
churchyard
on
the
hill
is
the
glow
of
autumn
going
out
is
that
the
winter
chill
and
yet
through
winter
noise
no
doubt
the
graves
are
very
still
are
the
woods
empty
voiceless
bare
on
sodden
leaves
do
you
tread
is
nothing
left
of
all
those
fair
is
the
whole
summer
fled
well
so
from
this
unwholesome
air
have
gone
away
these
dead
the
seasons
pierce
me
like
a
leaf
i
feel
the
autumn
blow
and
tremble
between
nature
grief
and
the
silent
death
below
o
summer
thou
art
very
brief
where
do
these
exiles
go
few
in
joy
sweet
riot
able
are
to
listen
thou
to
make
me
quiet
quenchest
the
sweet
riot
away
my
diet
puttest
me
in
prison
quenchest
joy
sweet
riot
that
the
heart
may
listen
see
thee
yes
master
when
thou
comest
thou
shalt
find
a
little
faith
on
earth
if
i
am
here
thou
how
oft
i
turn
to
thee
my
mind
how
sad
i
wait
until
thy
face
appear
hast
thou
not
ploughed
my
thorny
ground
full
sore
and
from
it
gathered
many
stones
and
sherds
plough
plough
and
harrow
till
it
needs
no
more
then
sow
thy
and
send
thy
birds
i
love
thee
lord
and
if
i
yield
to
fears
nor
trust
with
triumph
that
pale
doubt
defies
remember
lord
is
nigh
two
thousand
years
and
i
have
never
seen
thee
with
mine
eyes
and
when
i
lift
them
from
the
wondrous
tale
see
all
about
me
hath
so
strange
a
show
is
that
thy
river
running
down
the
vale
is
that
thy
wind
that
through
the
pines
doth
blow
thou
right
verily
appear
again
the
same
who
walked
the
paths
of
palestine
and
here
in
england
teach
thy
trusting
men
in
church
and
field
and
house
with
word
and
sign
here
are
but
lilies
sparrows
and
the
rest
my
hands
on
some
dear
proof
would
light
and
stay
but
my
heart
sees
john
leaning
on
thy
breast
and
sends
them
forth
to
do
what
thou
dost
say
broken
lord
my
god
how
long
shall
my
poor
heart
pant
for
a
boundless
joy
how
long
o
mighty
spirit
shall
i
hear
the
murmur
of
truth
crystal
waters
slide
from
the
deep
caverns
of
their
endless
being
but
my
lips
taste
not
and
the
grosser
air
choke
each
pure
inspiration
of
thy
will
i
am
a
denseness
me
and
the
light
can
not
round
myself
my
purest
thought
ere
it
is
thought
hath
caught
the
taint
of
earth
and
mocked
me
with
hard
thoughts
beyond
my
will
i
would
be
a
wind
whose
smallest
atom
is
a
viewless
wing
all
busy
with
the
pulsing
life
that
throbs
to
do
thy
bidding
yea
or
the
meanest
thing
that
has
relation
to
a
changeless
truth
could
i
but
be
instinct
with
thee
each
thought
the
lightning
of
a
pure
intelligence
and
every
act
as
the
loud
of
currents
warring
for
a
vacuum
lord
clothe
me
with
thy
truth
as
with
a
robe
purge
me
with
sorrow
i
will
bend
my
head
and
let
the
nations
of
thy
waves
pass
over
bathing
me
in
thy
consecrated
strength
and
let
thy
and
silver
winds
pass
through
my
frame
with
their
clear
influence
o
save
me
i
am
blind
lo
thwarting
shapes
wall
up
the
void
before
and
thrusting
out
lean
arms
of
unshaped
expectation
beckon
down
to
the
night
of
all
unholy
thoughts
oh
when
at
midnight
one
of
thy
strong
angels
stems
back
the
waves
of
earthly
influence
that
shape
unsteady
continents
around
me
and
they
draw
off
with
the
devouring
gush
of
exile
billows
that
have
found
a
home
leaving
me
islanded
on
unseen
points
hanging
thee
and
chaos
i
have
seen
unholy
shapes
lop
off
my
shining
thoughts
and
they
have
lent
me
leathern
wings
of
fear
of
baffled
pride
and
harrowing
distrust
and
godhead
with
its
crown
of
many
stars
its
pinnacles
of
flaming
holiness
and
voice
of
leaves
in
the
green
has
seemed
the
shadowed
image
of
a
self
then
my
soul
blackened
and
i
rose
to
find
and
grasp
my
doom
and
cleave
the
arching
deeps
of
desolation
o
lord
my
soul
is
a
forgotten
well
clad
round
with
its
own
rank
luxuriance
a
fountain
a
kind
sunbeam
searches
for
sinking
the
lustre
of
its
arrowy
finger
through
the
long
grass
its
own
strange
virtue
hath
blinded
up
its
crystal
eye
withal
make
me
a
broad
strong
river
coming
down
with
shouts
from
its
high
hills
whose
rocky
hearts
throb
forth
the
joy
of
their
stability
in
watery
pulses
from
their
inmost
deeps
and
i
shall
be
a
vein
upon
thy
world
circling
perpetual
from
the
parent
deep
most
mighty
one
confirm
and
multiply
my
thoughts
of
good
help
me
to
wall
each
sacred
treasure
round
with
the
firm
battlements
of
special
action
alas
my
holy
happy
thoughts
of
thee
make
not
perpetual
nest
within
my
soul
but
like
strange
birds
of
dazzling
colours
stoop
the
trailing
glories
of
their
sunward
speed
for
one
glad
moment
filling
my
blasted
boughs
with
the
sunshine
of
their
wings
make
me
a
forest
of
gladdest
life
wherein
perpetual
spring
lifts
up
her
leafy
tresses
in
the
wind
lo
now
i
see
thy
trembling
starlight
sit
among
my
pines
and
thy
young
moon
slide
down
my
arching
boughs
with
a
soft
sound
of
restless
eloquence
and
i
can
feel
a
joy
as
when
thy
hosts
of
trampling
winds
gathering
in
maddened
bands
roar
upward
through
the
blue
and
flashing
day
round
my
still
depths
of
uncleft
solitude
hear
me
o
lord
when
the
black
night
draws
down
upon
my
soul
and
voices
of
temptation
darken
down
the
misty
wind
slamming
thy
starry
doors
with
bitter
jests
thou
fool
they
seem
to
say
thou
hast
no
seed
of
goodness
in
thee
all
thy
nature
hath
been
stung
right
through
and
through
thy
sin
hath
blasted
thee
and
made
thee
old
thou
hadst
a
will
but
thou
hast
killed
it
dead
and
with
the
fulsome
garniture
of
life
built
out
the
loathsome
corpse
thou
art
a
child
of
night
and
death
even
lower
than
a
worm
gather
the
skirts
up
of
thy
shadowy
self
and
with
what
resolution
thou
hast
left
fall
on
the
damned
spikes
of
doom
oh
take
me
like
a
child
if
thou
hast
made
me
for
thyself
my
god
and
lead
me
up
thy
hills
i
shall
not
fear
so
thou
wilt
make
me
pure
and
beat
back
sin
with
the
terrors
of
thine
eye
it
fears
me
not
as
once
it
might
have
feared
thine
own
good
image
but
lays
bold
siege
at
my
heart
doors
oh
i
have
seen
a
thing
of
beauty
stand
in
the
young
moonlight
of
its
upward
thoughts
and
the
old
earth
came
round
it
with
its
gifts
of
gladness
whispering
leaves
and
odorous
plants
until
its
large
and
spiritual
eye
burned
with
intensest
love
my
god
i
could
have
watched
it
evermore
with
lest
when
the
noontide
of
the
summer
sun
let
down
the
tented
sunlight
on
the
plain
his
flaming
beams
should
scorch
my
darling
flower
and
through
the
fruitless
nights
of
leaden
gloom
of
plashing
rains
and
knotted
winds
of
cold
yea
when
thy
lightnings
ran
across
the
sky
and
the
loud
stumbling
blasts
fell
from
the
hills
upon
the
mounds
of
death
i
could
have
watched
guarding
such
beauty
like
another
life
but
o
my
god
it
changed
yet
methinks
i
know
not
if
it
was
not
i
its
beauty
turned
to
ghastly
loathsomeness
then
a
hand
spurned
me
backwards
from
the
clouds
and
with
the
gather
of
a
mighty
whirlwind
drew
in
the
glittering
gifts
of
life
how
long
o
lord
how
long
i
am
a
man
lost
in
a
rocky
place
lo
all
thy
echoes
smite
me
with
confusion
of
varied
speech
the
cry
of
vanished
life
rolled
upon
nations
sighs
of
hearts
uplifted
against
despair
the
stifled
sounds
of
woe
sitting
perpetual
by
its
grey
cold
well
or
wasted
toil
climbing
its
endless
hills
with
quickening
gasps
or
the
thin
winds
of
joy
that
beat
about
the
voices
of
the
crowd
lord
hast
thou
sent
thy
moons
to
mock
us
with
perpetual
hope
lighted
within
our
breasts
the
love
of
love
to
make
us
ripen
for
despair
my
god
oh
dost
thou
hold
each
individual
soul
strung
clear
upon
thy
flaming
rods
of
purpose
or
does
thine
inextinguishable
will
stand
on
the
steeps
of
night
with
lifted
hand
filling
the
yawning
wells
of
monstrous
space
with
mixing
thought
drinking
up
single
life
as
in
a
cup
and
from
the
rending
folds
of
glimmering
purpose
do
all
thy
navied
stars
slide
through
the
gloom
with
mystic
melody
like
wishes
on
a
brow
oh
is
my
soul
hung
like
a
dewdrop
in
thy
grassy
ways
drawn
up
again
into
the
rack
of
change
even
through
the
lustre
which
created
it
o
mighty
one
thou
wilt
not
smite
me
through
with
scorching
wrath
because
my
spirit
stands
bewildered
in
thy
circling
mysteries
oh
lift
the
burdened
gloom
that
chokes
my
soul
with
dews
of
darkness
smite
the
lean
winds
of
death
that
run
with
howls
around
the
ruined
temples
blowing
the
souls
of
men
about
like
leaves
lo
the
broad
widen
overhead
arise
like
drifting
snow
and
happy
life
goes
whitening
down
the
stream
of
boundless
action
whilst
my
fettered
soul
sits
as
a
captive
in
a
noisome
dungeon
watches
the
pulses
of
his
withered
heart
lave
out
the
sparkling
minutes
of
his
life
on
the
idle
flags
come
in
the
glory
of
thine
excellence
rive
the
dense
gloom
with
wedges
of
clear
light
and
let
the
shimmer
of
thy
chariot
wheels
burn
through
the
cracks
of
night
so
slowly
lord
to
lift
myself
to
thee
with
hands
of
toil
climbing
the
slippery
cliffs
of
unheard
prayer
lift
up
a
hand
among
my
idle
days
one
beckoning
finger
i
will
cast
aside
the
clogs
of
earthly
circumstance
and
run
up
the
broad
highways
where
the
countless
worlds
sit
ripening
in
the
summer
of
thy
love
send
a
clear
meaning
sparkling
through
the
years
burst
all
the
and
make
men
hearts
gush
up
like
fountains
with
thy
melody
brighten
the
hollow
eyes
fill
with
life
fruits
the
hands
that
grope
and
scramble
down
the
wastes
and
let
the
ghastly
troops
of
withered
ones
come
shining
the
mountains
of
thy
love
lord
thy
strange
mysteries
come
thickening
down
upon
my
head
like
snowflakes
shutting
out
the
happy
upper
fields
with
chilly
vapour
shall
i
content
my
soul
with
a
weak
sense
of
safety
or
feed
my
ravenous
hunger
with
sore
purged
hopes
that
are
not
hopes
but
fears
clad
in
white
raiment
the
creeds
lie
in
the
hollow
of
men
hearts
like
festering
pools
glassing
their
own
corruption
the
slimy
eyes
stare
up
with
dull
approval
and
answer
not
when
thy
bright
starry
feet
move
on
the
watery
floors
oh
shake
men
souls
together
like
the
gathering
of
all
oceans
rent
from
their
hidden
chambers
till
the
waves
lift
up
their
million
voices
of
high
joy
along
the
echoing
cliffs
come
thus
o
lord
with
nightly
gifts
of
stars
and
lay
a
hand
of
mighty
peace
upon
the
quivering
flood
o
wilt
thou
hear
me
when
i
cry
to
thee
i
am
a
child
lost
in
a
mighty
forest
the
air
is
thick
with
voices
and
strange
hands
reach
through
the
dusk
and
pluck
me
by
the
skirts
there
is
a
voice
which
sounds
like
words
from
home
but
as
i
stumble
on
to
reach
it
seems
to
leap
from
rock
to
rock
oh
if
it
is
willing
obliquity
of
sense
descend
heal
all
my
wanderings
take
me
by
the
hand
and
lead
me
homeward
through
the
shadows
let
me
not
by
my
wilful
acts
of
pride
block
up
the
windows
of
thy
truth
and
grow
a
wasted
withered
thing
that
stumbles
on
down
to
the
grave
with
folded
hands
of
sloth
and
leaden
confidence
still
am
i
haunting
thy
door
with
my
prayers
still
they
are
panting
up
thy
steep
stairs
wouldst
thou
not
rather
come
down
to
my
heart
and
there
o
my
father
be
what
thou
art
my
thoughts
are
like
pulsing
in
moonlight
my
heart
like
a
silver
cup
filled
with
red
wine
my
soul
a
pale
gleaming

old
i
stood
in
an
ancient
garden
with
high
red
walls
around
over
them
grey
and
green
lichens
in
shadowy
arabesque
wound
the
topmost
climbing
blossoms
on
fields
looked
out
but
within
were
shelter
and
shadow
with
daintiest
odours
about
there
were
alleys
and
lurking
arbours
deep
glooms
into
which
to
dive
the
lawns
were
as
soft
as
fleeces
of
daisies
i
counted
but
five
the
was
so
aged
it
had
gathered
a
thoughtful
grace
the
of
the
shadow
that
so
had
furrowed
its
face
the
flowers
were
all
of
the
oldest
that
ever
in
garden
sprung
red
and
and
dark
purple
the
flaming
hung
along
the
borders
fringed
with
broad
thick
edges
of
box
stood
foxgloves
and
gorgeous
poppies
and
hollyhocks
there
were
junipers
trimmed
into
castles
and
bowed
into
tents
for
the
garden
though
ancient
and
pensive
still
wore
quaint
ornaments
it
was
all
so
stately
fantastic
its
old
wind
hardly
would
stir
young
spring
when
she
merrily
entered
scarce
felt
it
a
place
for
her
ii
i
stood
in
the
summer
morning
under
a
cavernous
yew
the
sun
was
gently
climbing
and
the
scents
rose
after
the
dew
i
saw
the
wise
old
mansion
like
a
cow
in
the
heat
stand
in
a
lake
of
shadows
that
rippled
about
its
feet
its
windows
were
oriel
and
latticed
lowly
and
wide
and
fair
and
its
chimneys
like
clustered
pillars
stood
up
in
the
thin
blue
air
white
doves
like
the
thoughts
of
a
lady
haunted
it
all
about
with
a
train
of
green
and
blue
comets
the
peacock
went
marching
stout
the
birds
in
the
trees
were
singing
a
song
as
old
as
the
world
of
love
and
green
leaves
and
sunshine
and
winter
folded
and
furled
they
sang
that
never
was
sadness
but
it
melted
and
passed
away
they
sang
that
never
was
darkness
but
in
came
the
conquering
day
and
i
knew
that
a
maiden
somewhere
in
a
low
room
in
a
nimbus
of
shining
garments
an
aureole
of
bloom
looked
out
on
the
garden
dreamy
and
knew
not
it
was
old
looked
past
the
gray
and
the
sombre
saw
but
the
green
and
the
gold
iii
i
stood
in
the
gathering
twilight
in
a
gently
blowing
wind
then
the
house
looked
half
uneasy
like
one
that
was
left
behind
the
roses
had
lost
their
redness
and
cold
the
grass
had
grown
at
roost
were
the
pigeons
and
peacock
the
seemed
a
the
world
by
the
gathering
twilight
in
a
gauzy
dusk
was
clad
something
went
into
my
spirit
and
made
me
a
little
sad
grew
and
gathered
the
twilight
it
filled
my
heart
and
brain
the
sadness
grew
more
than
sadness
it
turned
to
a
gentle
pain
browned
and
brooded
the
twilight
pervaded
absorbed
the
calm
till
it
seemed
for
some
human
sorrows
there
could
not
be
any
balm
iv
then
i
knew
that
up
a
staircase
which
untrod
will
yet
creak
and
shake
deep
in
a
distant
chamber
a
ghost
was
coming
awake
in
the
growing
darkness
growing
growing
till
her
eyes
appear
like
spots
of
a
deeper
twilight
but
more
transparent
clear
thin
as
hot
air
thin
as
crape
an
ethereal
shadow
of
something
is
taking
a
certain
shape
a
shape
whose
hands
hang
listless
let
hang
its
disordered
hair
a
shape
whose
bosom
is
heaving
but
draws
not
in
the
air
and
i
know
what
time
the
moonlight
on
her
nest
of
shadows
will
sit
out
on
the
dim
lawn
gliding
that
shadowy
shadow
will
flit
the
moon
is
dreaming
upward
from
a
sea
of
cloud
and
gleam
she
looks
as
if
she
had
seen
me
never
but
in
a
dream
down
the
stair
i
know
she
is
coming
lifting
her
train
it
creaks
not
she
hears
it
creaking
where
once
there
was
a
brain
out
at
yon
she
coming
with
a
timid
glance
right
and
left
her
look
is
hopeless
yet
eager
the
look
of
a
heart
bereft
across
the
lawn
she
is
flitting
her
thin
gown
feels
the
wind
are
her
white
feet
bending
the
grasses
her
hair
is
lifted
behind
vi
shall
i
stay
to
look
on
her
nearer
would
she
start
and
vanish
away
oh
no
she
will
never
see
me
stand
i
near
as
i
may
it
is
not
this
wind
she
is
feeling
not
this
cool
grass
below
the
wind
and
the
grass
of
an
evening
a
hundred
years
ago
she
sees
no
roses
darkling
no
stately
hollyhocks
dim
she
is
only
thinking
and
dreaming
the
garden
the
night
and
him
the
unlit
windows
behind
her
the
timeless
the
trees
and
the
moon
and
the
shadows
a
hundred
years
agone
is
a
night
for
a
ghostly
lover
to
haunt
the
spot
is
he
come
in
his
dreams
to
this
garden
i
gaze
but
i
see
him
not
vii
i
will
not
look
on
her
nearer
my
heart
would
be
torn
in
twain
from
my
eyes
the
garden
would
vanish
in
the
falling
of
their
rain
i
will
not
look
on
a
sorrow
that
darkens
into
despair
on
the
surge
of
a
heart
that
can
not
yet
can
not
cease
to
bear
my
soul
to
hers
would
be
calling
she
would
hear
no
word
it
said
if
i
cried
aloud
in
the
stillness
she
would
never
turn
her
head
she
is
dreaming
the
sky
above
her
she
is
dreaming
the
earth
below
this
night
she
lost
her
lover
a
hundred
years
ago
noonday
everything
goes
to
its
rest
the
hills
are
asleep
in
the
noon
and
life
is
as
still
in
its
nest
as
the
moon
when
she
looks
on
a
moon
in
the
depth
of
a
calm
river
breast
as
it
steals
through
a
midnight
in
june
the
streams
have
forgotten
the
sea
in
the
dream
of
their
musical
sound
the
sunlight
is
thick
on
the
tree
and
the
shadows
lie
warm
on
the
ground
so
still
you
may
watch
them
and
see
every
breath
that
awakens
around
the
churchyard
lies
still
in
the
heat
with
its
handful
of
mouldering
bone
as
still
as
the
long
stalk
of
wheat
in
the
shadow
that
sits
by
the
stone
as
still
as
the
grass
at
my
feet
when
i
walk
in
the
meadows
alone
the
waves
are
asleep
on
the
main
and
the
ships
are
asleep
on
the
wave
and
the
thoughts
are
as
still
in
my
brain
as
the
echo
that
sleeps
in
the
cave
all
rest
from
their
labour
and
pain
then
why
should
not
i
in
my
grave
lights
the
who
lights
the
fire
that
forth
so
gracefully
and
freely
frolicketh
the
fairy
smoke
some
pretty
one
who
never
felt
the
yoke
glad
girl
or
maiden
more
sedate
than
she
pedant
it
can
not
villain
can
not
be
some
genius
his
own
symbol
woke
but
puritan
nor
rogue
in
virtue
cloke
nor
has
done
it
certainly
ha
ha
you
can
not
find
the
lighter
out
for
all
the
blue
smoke
pantomimic
gesture
his
name
or
nature
sex
or
age
or
vesture
the
fire
was
lit
by
human
care
no
doubt
but
now
the
smoke
is
nature
tributary
dancing
man
and
nothing
like
a
fairy
would
have
who
would
have
thought
that
even
an
idle
song
were
such
a
holy
and
celestial
thing
that
wickedness
and
envy
can
not
sing
that
music
for
no
moment
lives
with
wrong
i
know
this
for
a
very
grievous
throng
dark
thoughts
low
wishes
round
my
bosom
cling
and
underneath
the
hidden
holy
spring
stagnates
because
of
their
enchantment
strong
blow
breath
of
heaven
on
all
this
poison
blow
and
heart
glow
upward
to
this
gracious
breath
between
them
vanish
mist
of
sin
and
death
and
let
the
life
of
life
within
me
flow
love
is
the
green
earth
the
celestial
air
and
music
runs
like
dews
and
rivers
there
a
december
i
this
is
the
sweetness
of
an
april
day
the
softness
of
the
spring
is
on
the
face
of
the
old
year
she
has
no
natural
grace
but
something
comes
to
her
from
far
away
out
of
the
past
and
on
her
old
decay
the
beauty
of
her
childhood
you
can
and
yet
she
moveth
with
a
stormy
pace
and
goeth
stay
old
year
oh
stay
we
do
not
like
new
friends
we
love
the
old
with
young
fierce
hopeful
hearts
we
ill
agree
but
thou
art
patient
stagnant
calm
and
cold
and
not
like
that
new
year
that
is
to
be
life
promise
love
her
eyes
may
fill
fair
child
we
know
the
past
and
will
not
be
beguiled
ii
yet
the
free
heart
will
not
be
captive
long
and
if
she
changes
often
she
is
free
but
if
she
changes
one
has
mastery
who
makes
the
joy
the
last
in
every
song
and
so
i
blessed
the
breezes
strong
that
swept
the
blue
i
blessed
the
breezes
free
that
rolled
wet
leaves
like
rivers
shiningly
i
blessed
the
purple
woods
i
stood
among
and
yet
the
spring
is
better
bitterness
came
with
the
words
but
did
not
stay
with
them
accomplishment
and
promise
field
and
stem
new
green
fresh
growing
in
a
fragrant
dress
and
we
behind
with
death
and
memory
nay
but
i
will
follow
thee
day
beautiful
stories
wed
with
lovely
days
like
words
and
music
what
shall
be
the
tale
of
love
and
nobleness
that
might
avail
to
express
in
action
what
this
sweetness
says
the
sweetness
of
a
day
of
airs
and
rays
that
are
strange
glories
on
the
winter
pale
alas
o
beauty
all
my
fancies
fail
i
can
not
tell
a
story
in
thy
praise
thou
hast
thou
hast
one
set
and
sure
to
chime
with
thee
as
with
the
days
of
winter
wild
for
joy
like
sorrow
loves
his
blessed
feet
who
shone
from
heaven
on
earth
this
a
brother
and
a
saviour
mary
child
and
so
fair
day
thou
thy
story
sweet
a
february
i
know
not
what
among
the
grass
thou
art
thy
nature
nor
thy
substance
fairest
flower
nor
what
to
other
eyes
thou
hast
of
power
to
send
thine
image
through
them
to
the
heart
but
when
i
push
the
frosty
leaves
apart
and
see
thee
hiding
in
thy
wintry
bower
thou
growest
up
within
me
from
that
hour
and
through
the
snow
i
with
the
spring
depart
i
have
no
words
but
fragrant
is
the
breath
pale
beauty
of
thy
second
life
within
there
is
a
wind
that
cometh
for
thy
death
but
thou
a
life
immortal
dost
begin
where
in
one
soul
which
is
thy
heaven
shall
dwell
thy
spirit
beautiful
unspeakable
now
in
the
dark
of
february
rains
poor
lovers
of
the
sunshine
spring
is
born
the
earthy
fields
are
full
of
hidden
corn
and
march
violets
bud
along
the
lanes
therefore
with
joy
believe
in
what
remains
and
thou
who
dost
not
feel
them
do
not
scorn
our
early
songs
for
winter
overworn
and
faith
in
god
handwriting
on
the
plains
hope
writes
he
love
in
the
first
violet
joy
even
from
heaven
in
songs
and
winds
and
trees
and
having
caught
the
happy
words
in
these
while
nature
labours
with
the
letters
yet
spring
can
not
cheat
us
though
her
be
broken
nor
leave
us
for
we
know
what
god
hath
spoken
i
envy
the
that
shake
so
high
in
winds
that
fill
them
full
of
heavenly
airs
i
envy
every
little
cloud
that
shares
with
unseen
angels
evening
in
the
sky
i
envy
most
the
youngest
stars
that
lie
and
the
loving
heaven
that
bears
and
night
that
makes
strong
worlds
of
them
unawares
and
all
god
other
beautiful
and
nigh
nay
nay
i
envy
not
and
these
are
dreams
fancies
and
images
of
real
heaven
my
longings
all
my
longing
prayers
are
given
for
that
which
is
and
not
for
that
which
seems
draw
me
o
lord
to
thy
true
heaven
above
the
heaven
of
thy
thought
thy
rest
thy
love
dwellers
down
a
warm
alley
early
in
the
year
among
the
woods
with
all
the
sunshine
in
and
all
the
winds
outside
it
i
begin
to
think
that
something
gracious
will
appear
if
anything
of
grace
inhabit
here
or
there
be
friendship
in
the
woods
to
win
might
one
but
find
companions
more
akin
to
trees
and
grass
and
happy
daylight
clear
and
in
this
wood
spend
one
long
hour
at
home
the
fairies
do
not
love
so
bright
a
place
and
angels
to
the
forest
never
come
but
i
have
dreamed
of
some
harmonious
race
the
kindred
of
the
shapes
that
haunt
the
shore
of
music
flow
and
flow
for
evermore
along
the
tops
of
all
the
yellow
trees
the
trees
the
sunshine
lies
and
where
the
leaves
are
gone
long
rays
surprise
lone
depths
of
thicket
with
their
brightnesses
and
through
the
woods
all
waste
of
many
a
breeze
cometh
more
joy
of
light
for
poet
eyes
green
fields
lying
yellow
underneath
the
skies
and
shining
houses
and
blue
distances
by
the
roadside
like
rocks
of
golden
ore
that
make
the
western
so
bright
the
briar
and
the
furze
are
all
alight
perhaps
the
year
will
be
so
fair
no
more
but
now
the
fallen
falling
leaves
are
gay
and
autumn
old
has
shone
into
a
day
mourner
that
dost
deserve
thy
mournfulness
call
thyself
punished
call
the
earth
thy
hell
say
god
is
angry
and
i
earned
it
well
i
would
not
have
him
smile
on
wickedness
say
this
and
straightway
all
thy
grief
grows
less
god
rules
at
least
i
find
as
prophets
tell
and
proves
it
in
this
prison
then
thy
cell
smiles
with
an
unsuspected
loveliness
a
prison
and
yet
from
door
and
i
catch
a
thousand
breaths
of
his
sweet
air
even
to
me
his
days
and
nights
are
fair
he
shows
me
many
a
flower
and
many
a
star
and
though
i
mourn
and
he
is
very
far
he
does
not
kill
the
hope
that
reaches
there
us
the
shew
us
the
father
chiming
stars
of
space
and
lives
that
fit
the
worlds
and
means
and
powers
a
thought
that
holds
them
up
reveal
to
ours
a
wisdom
we
have
been
made
wise
to
trace
and
looking
out
from
sweetest
nature
face
from
sunsets
moonlights
rivers
hills
and
flowers
infinite
love
and
beauty
all
the
hours
woo
men
that
love
them
with
divinest
grace
and
to
the
depths
of
all
the
answering
soul
high
justice
speaks
and
calls
the
world
her
own
and
yet
we
long
and
yet
we
have
not
known
the
very
father
face
who
means
the
whole
shew
us
the
father
nature
conscience
love
revealed
in
beauty
is
there
one
above
when
peevish
flaws
his
soul
have
stirred
to
fretful
tears
for
crossed
desires
obedient
to
his
mother
word
my
child
to
banishment
retires
as
disappears
the
moon
when
wind
heaps
miles
of
mist
her
visage
so
vanisheth
his
face
behind
the
cloud
of
his
white
pinafore
i
can
not
then
come
near
my
child
a
gulf
between
of
gainful
loss
he
to
the
infinite
exiled
i
waiting
for
i
can
not
cross
ah
then
what
wonder
passing
show
the
behind
it
brings
like
that
creatures
know
remembering
legs
foreseeing
wings
mysterious
moment
when
or
how
is
the
bewildering
change
begun
hid
in
far
deeps
the
awful
now
when
turns
his
being
to
the
sun
a
light
goes
up
behind
his
eyes
a
still
small
voice
behind
his
ears
a
listing
wind
about
him
sighs
and
lo
the
inner
landscape
clears
hid
by
that
screen
a
wondrous
shine
is
gathering
for
a
sweet
surprise
as
moses
grew
in
dark
divine
too
radiant
for
his
people
eyes
for
when
the
garment
sinks
again
outbeams
a
brow
of
heavenly
wile
clear
as
a
morning
after
rain
and
sunny
with
a
perfect
smile
oh
would
that
i
the
secret
knew
of
hiding
from
my
evil
part
and
turning
to
the
lovely
true
the
open
windows
of
my
heart
lord
in
thy
skirt
love
tender
gaol
hide
thou
my
selfish
heart
disgrace
fill
me
with
light
and
then
unveil
to
friend
and
foe
a
friendly
face
i
a
pool
of
broken
sunbeams
lay
upon
the
radiant
and
rich
profound
and
gay
as
ever
diamond
bore
small
flitting
hands
a
handkerchief
spread
like
a
cunning
trap
prone
lay
the
gorgeous
in
the
lap
deftly
she
folded
up
the
prize
with
lovely
avarice
like
one
whom
having
had
made
wise
she
bore
it
off
in
bliss
but
ah
when
for
her
prisoned
gems
she
peeped
to
prove
them
there
no
glories
broken
from
their
stems
lay
in
the
kerchief
bare
for
still
outside
the
nursery
door
the
bright
persistency
a
molten
diadem
on
the
floor
lay
burning
wondrously
ii
how
oft
have
i
laid
fold
from
fold
and
peered
into
my
mind
to
see
of
all
the
purple
and
gold
not
one
gleam
left
behind
the
best
of
gifts
will
not
be
stored
the
manna
of
yesterday
has
filled
no
sacred
to
keep
new
need
away
thy
grace
o
lord
it
is
thyself
thy
presence
is
thy
light
i
can
not
lay
it
on
my
shelf
or
take
it
from
thy
sight
for
daily
bread
we
daily
pray
the
want
still
breeds
the
cry
and
so
we
meet
day
after
day
thou
father
in
heaven
and
i
is
my
house
dreary
wall
and
floor
will
not
the
darkness
flit
i
go
outside
my
shadowy
door
and
in
thy
rainbow
sit
oh
is
it
death
that
comes
to
have
a
foretaste
of
the
whole
the
planets
and
the
stars
will
glimmer
through
my
but
will
not
shine
upon
my
soul
for
i
shall
lie
as
dead
though
yet
i
am
above
the
ground
all
passionless
with
scarce
a
breath
with
hands
of
rest
and
eyes
of
death
i
shall
be
carried
swiftly
round
or
if
my
life
should
break
the
idle
night
with
doubtful
gleams
through
mossy
arches
will
i
go
through
arches
ruinous
and
low
and
chase
the
true
and
false
in
dreams
why
should
i
fall
asleep
when
i
am
still
upon
my
bed
the
moon
will
shine
the
winds
will
rise
and
all
around
and
through
the
skies
the
light
clouds
travel
my
head
o
busy
busy
things
ye
mock
me
with
your
ceaseless
life
for
all
the
hidden
springs
will
flow
and
all
the
blades
of
grass
will
grow
when
i
have
neither
peace
nor
strife
and
all
the
long
night
through
the
restless
streams
will
hurry
by
and
round
the
lands
with
endless
roar
the
white
waves
fall
upon
the
shore
and
bit
by
bit
devour
the
dry
even
thus
but
silently
eternity
thy
tide
shall
flow
and
side
by
side
with
every
star
thy
swell
shall
bear
me
far
an
idle
boat
with
none
to
row
my
senses
fail
with
sleep
my
heart
beats
thick
the
night
is
noon
and
faintly
through
its
misty
folds
i
hear
a
drowsy
clock
that
holds
its
converse
with
the
waning
moon
oh
solemn
mystery
that
i
should
be
so
closely
bound
with
neither
terror
nor
constraint
without
a
murmur
of
complaint
and
lose
myself
upon
such
ground
on
the
far
horizon
there
heaps
of
cloudy
darkness
rest
though
the
wind
is
in
the
air
there
is
stupor
east
and
west
for
the
sky
no
change
is
making
scarce
we
know
it
from
the
plain
droop
its
eyelids
never
waking
blinded
by
the
misty
rain
save
on
high
one
little
spot
round
the
baffled
moon
a
space
where
the
tumult
ceaseth
not
wildly
goes
the
midnight
race
and
a
joy
doth
rise
in
me
upward
gazing
on
the
sight
when
i
think
that
others
see
in
yon
clouds
a
like
delight
how
perchance
an
aged
man
struggling
with
the
wind
and
rain
in
the
moonlight
cold
and
wan
feels
his
heart
grow
young
again
as
the
cloudy
rack
goes
by
how
the
mantles
up
till
the
fountain
deep
and
dry
yields
once
more
a
sparkling
cup
or
upon
the
gazing
child
cometh
down
a
thought
of
glory
which
will
keep
him
undefiled
till
his
head
is
old
and
hoary
for
it
may
be
he
hath
woke
and
hath
raised
his
fair
young
form
strangely
on
his
eyes
have
broke
all
the
splendours
of
the
storm
and
his
young
soul
forth
doth
leap
with
the
in
the
moon
and
his
heart
the
light
will
keep
though
the
vision
passeth
soon
thus
a
joy
hath
often
laughed
on
my
soul
from
other
skies
bearing
on
its
wings
a
draught
from
the
wells
of
paradise
for
that
not
to
me
alone
comes
a
splendour
out
of
fear
where
the
light
of
heaven
hath
shone
there
is
glory
far
and
near
of
the
poor
bird
that
can
not
fly
kindly
you
think
and
mournfully
for
prisoners
and
for
exiles
all
you
let
the
tears
of
pity
fall
and
very
true
the
grief
should
be
that
mourns
the
bondage
of
the
free
the
soul
has
a
fatherland
binds
not
many
a
tyrant
hand
and
the
winged
spirit
has
a
home
but
can
she
always
homeward
come
poor
souls
with
all
their
wounds
and
foes
will
you
not
also
pity
those
father
i
cry
to
thee
for
bread
with
hungred
longing
eager
prayer
thou
and
givest
me
instead
more
hunger
and
a
lord
how
long
my
days
decline
my
youth
is
lapped
in
memories
old
i
need
not
bread
alone
but
wine
see
cup
and
hand
to
thee
i
hold
and
yet
thou
givest
thanks
o
lord
that
still
my
heart
with
hunger
faints
the
day
will
come
when
at
thy
board
i
sit
forgetting
all
my
plaints
if
rain
must
come
and
winds
must
blow
and
i
pore
long
chart
yet
lord
let
not
the
hunger
go
and
keep
the
faintness
at
my
heart
year
eve
a
waking
i
have
not
any
fearful
tale
to
tell
of
fabled
giant
or
of
or
bloody
deed
to
pilfer
and
to
sell
to
those
who
feed
with
such
a
gaping
maw
but
what
in
yonder
hamlet
there
befell
or
rather
what
in
it
my
fancy
saw
i
will
declare
albeit
it
may
seem
too
simple
and
too
common
for
a
dream
two
brothers
were
they
and
they
sat
alone
without
a
word
beside
the
winter
glow
for
it
was
many
years
since
they
had
known
the
love
that
bindeth
brothers
till
the
snow
of
age
had
frozen
it
and
it
had
grown
an
stream
that
would
not
flow
and
so
they
sat
with
warmth
about
their
feet
and
ice
about
their
hearts
that
would
not
beat
and
yet
it
was
a
night
for
quiet
hope
a
night
the
very
last
of
all
the
year
to
many
a
youthful
heart
did
seem
to
ope
an
eye
within
the
future
round
and
clear
and
age
itself
that
travels
down
the
slope
sat
glad
and
waiting
as
the
hour
drew
near
the
dreamy
hour
that
hath
the
heaviest
chime
jerking
our
souls
into
the
coming
time
but
they
alas
for
age
when
it
is
old
the
silly
calendar
they
did
not
heed
alas
for
age
when
in
its
bosom
cold
there
is
not
warmth
to
nurse
a
bladed
weed
they
thought
not
of
the
morrow
but
did
hold
a
quiet
sitting
as
their
hearts
did
feed
inwardly
on
themselves
as
still
and
mute
as
if
they
were
from
head
to
foot
o
solemn
kindly
night
she
looketh
still
with
all
her
moon
upon
us
now
and
then
and
though
she
dwelleth
most
in
craggy
hill
she
hath
an
eye
unto
the
hearts
of
men
so
past
a
corner
of
the
she
thrust
a
long
bright
finger
just
as
ten
had
struck
and
on
the
it
came
healing
each
hour
raw
edge
with
tender
flame
there
is
a
something
in
the
winds
of
heaven
that
stirreth
purposely
and
maketh
men
and
unto
every
little
wind
is
given
a
thing
to
do
ere
it
is
still
again
so
when
the
little
clock
had
struck
eleven
the
edging
moon
had
drawn
her
silver
pen
across
a
mirror
making
them
aware
of
something
ghostlier
than
their
own
grey
hair
therefore
they
drew
aside
the
and
looked
upon
the
sleeping
town
below
and
on
the
little
church
which
sat
behind
as
keeping
watch
upon
the
scanty
row
of
steady
tombstones
some
of
which
inclined
and
others
upright
in
the
moon
did
show
like
to
a
village
down
below
the
waves
it
was
so
still
and
cool
among
the
graves
but
not
a
word
from
either
mouth
did
fall
except
it
were
some
very
plain
remark
ah
why
should
such
as
they
be
glad
at
all
for
years
they
had
not
listened
to
the
lark
the
child
was
dead
in
them
yet
did
there
crawl
a
wish
about
their
hearts
and
as
the
bark
of
distant
came
they
were
aware
of
a
strange
longing
for
the
open
air
ah
many
an
year
had
spun
a
web
of
heavy
cloud
about
their
brain
and
many
a
sun
and
moon
had
come
and
gone
since
they
walked
arm
in
arm
these
brothers
twain
but
now
with
timéd
pace
their
feet
did
stun
the
village
echoes
into
quiet
pain
the
street
appearéd
very
short
and
white
and
they
like
ghosts
unquiet
for
the
light
right
through
the
churchyard
one
of
them
did
say
i
knew
not
which
was
elder
of
the
two
right
through
the
churchyard
is
our
better
way
ay
said
the
other
past
the
scrubby
yew
i
have
not
seen
her
grave
for
many
a
day
and
it
is
in
me
that
with
moonlight
too
it
might
be
pleasant
thinking
of
old
faces
and
yet
i
seldom
go
into
such
places
strange
strange
indeed
to
me
the
moonlight
wan
sitting
about
a
solitary
stone
stranger
than
many
tales
it
is
to
scan
the
earthy
fragment
of
a
human
bone
but
stranger
still
to
see
a
grey
old
man
apart
from
all
his
fellows
and
alone
with
the
pale
night
and
all
its
giant
quiet
therefore
that
stone
was
strange
and
those
two
by
it
it
was
their
mother
grave
and
here
were
hid
the
priceless
pulses
of
a
mother
soul
full
sixty
years
it
was
since
she
had
slid
into
the
other
world
through
that
deep
hole
but
as
they
stood
it
seemed
the
grew
deaf
with
sudden
hammers
was
the
mole
niddering
about
its
be
still
old
men
be
very
still
and
ye
will
hear
again
ay
ye
will
hear
it
ye
may
go
away
but
it
will
stay
with
you
till
ye
are
dead
it
is
but
earthy
mould
and
quiet
clay
but
it
hath
power
to
turn
the
oldest
head
their
eyes
met
in
the
moon
and
they
did
say
more
than
a
hundred
tongues
had
ever
said
so
they
passed
onwards
through
the
rapping
wicket
into
the
centre
of
a
firry
thicket
it
was
a
solemn
meeting
of
earth
life
an
inquest
held
upon
the
death
of
things
and
in
the
naked
north
full
thick
and
rife
the
too
were
meeting
as
on
wings
shorn
round
the
edges
by
the
frost
keen
knife
and
the
trees
seemed
to
gather
into
rings
waiting
to
be
made
blind
as
they
did
quail
among
their
own
wan
shadows
thin
and
pale
many
strange
noises
are
there
among
trees
and
most
within
the
quiet
moony
light
therefore
those
aged
men
are
on
their
knees
as
if
they
listened
somewhat
ye
are
right
upwards
it
bubbles
like
the
hum
of
bees
although
ye
never
heard
it
till
the
mighty
mother
calleth
ever
so
to
all
her
children
from
below
ay
ye
have
walked
upon
her
paven
ways
and
heard
her
voices
in
the
but
ye
have
never
listened
what
she
says
when
the
is
pressing
on
her
face
one
night
like
this
is
more
than
many
days
to
him
who
hears
the
music
and
the
bass
of
deep
immortal
lullabies
which
calm
his
troubled
soul
as
with
a
hushing
psalm
i
know
not
whether
there
is
power
in
sleep
to
dim
the
eyelids
of
the
shining
moon
but
so
it
seemed
then
for
still
more
deep
she
grew
into
a
heavy
cloud
which
soon
hiding
her
outmost
edges
seemed
to
keep
a
pressure
on
her
so
there
came
a
swoon
among
the
shadows
which
still
lay
together
but
in
their
slumber
knew
not
one
another
but
while
the
midnight
gropéd
for
the
chime
as
she
were
heavy
with
excess
of
dreams
she
from
the
cloud
thick
web
a
second
time
made
many
shadows
though
with
minished
beams
and
as
she
lookéd
eastward
through
the
rime
of
a
thin
vapour
got
of
frosty
steams
there
fell
a
little
snow
upon
the
crown
of
a
near
hillock
very
bald
and
brown
and
on
its
top
they
found
a
little
spring
a
very
helpful
little
spring
indeed
which
evermore
unwound
a
tiny
string
of
earnest
water
with
continual
speed
and
so
the
brothers
stood
and
heard
it
sing
for
all
was
and
not
a
seed
had
struck
and
nothing
came
but
noises
light
of
the
continual
whitening
of
the
night
there
is
a
kindness
in
the
falling
snow
it
is
a
grey
head
to
the
spring
time
mild
so
as
the
creamy
vapour
bowéd
low
crowning
the
earth
with
honour
undefiled
within
each
withered
man
arose
a
glow
as
if
he
fain
would
turn
into
a
child
there
was
a
gladness
somewhere
in
the
ground
which
in
his
bosom
nowhere
could
be
found
not
through
the
purple
summer
or
the
blush
of
red
voluptuous
roses
did
it
come
that
silent
speaking
voice
but
through
the
slush
and
snowy
quiet
of
the
winter
numb
it
was
a
barren
mound
that
heard
the
gush
of
living
water
from
two
fountains
dumb
two
rocky
human
hearts
which
long
had
striven
to
make
a
pleasant
noise
beneath
high
heaven
now
from
the
village
came
the
onward
shout
of
lightsome
voices
and
of
merry
cheer
it
was
a
youthful
group
that
wandered
out
to
do
obeisance
to
the
glad
new
year
and
as
they
passed
they
sang
with
voices
stout
a
song
which
i
was
very
fain
to
hear
but
as
they
darkened
on
away
it
died
and
the
two
men
walked
homewards
side
by
side
north
wales
to
the
when
the
summer
gave
us
a
longer
day
and
the
leaves
were
thickest
i
went
away
like
an
isle
through
dark
clouds
of
the
infinite
blue
was
that
from
london
and
you
it
was
but
one
burst
into
life
and
air
one
backward
glance
on
the
skirts
of
care
a
height
on
the
hills
with
the
smoke
below
and
the
joy
that
came
quickly
was
quick
to
go
but
i
know
and
i
can
not
forget
so
soon
how
the
earth
is
shone
on
by
sun
and
moon
how
the
clouds
hide
the
mountains
and
how
they
move
when
the
morning
sunshine
lies
warm
above
i
know
how
the
waters
fall
and
run
in
the
rocks
and
the
heather
away
from
the
sun
how
they
hang
like
garlands
on
all
and
are
the
land
music
those
crystal
tides
i
know
how
they
gather
in
valleys
fair
meet
valleys
those
beautiful
waves
to
bear
how
they
dance
through
the
rocks
how
they
rest
in
the
pool
how
they
darken
how
sparkle
and
how
they
are
cool
i
know
how
the
rocks
from
their
kisses
climb
to
keep
the
storms
off
with
a
front
sublime
and
how
on
their
platforms
and
sloping
walls
the
shadow
of
and
falls
i
know
how
the
valleys
are
bright
from
far
rocks
meadows
and
waters
the
wood
and
the
scaur
and
how
the
roadside
and
the
nearest
hill
the
foxglove
and
heather
and
harebell
fill
i
know
but
the
joy
that
was
quick
to
go
gave
more
knowledge
to
me
than
words
can
shew
and
know
the
story
and
how
they
fare
who
love
the
green
earth
and
the
heavenly
air
to
come
to
me
come
to
me
o
my
god
come
to
me
everywhere
let
the
trees
mean
thee
and
the
grassy
sod
and
the
water
and
the
air
for
thou
art
so
far
that
i
often
doubt
as
on
every
side
i
stare
searching
within
and
looking
without
if
thou
canst
be
anywhere
how
did
men
find
thee
in
days
of
old
how
did
they
grow
so
sure
they
fought
in
thy
name
they
were
glad
and
bold
they
suffered
and
kept
themselves
pure
but
now
they
say
neither
above
the
sphere
nor
down
in
the
heart
of
man
but
solely
in
fancy
ambition
and
fear
the
thought
of
thee
began
if
only
that
perfect
tale
were
true
which
ages
have
not
made
old
which
of
endless
many
makes
one
anew
and
simplicity
manifold
but
taught
that
they
who
did
his
word
the
truth
of
it
sure
would
know
i
will
try
to
do
it
if
he
be
lord
again
the
old
faith
will
glow
again
the
old
will
blow
that
he
promised
to
their
prayer
and
obeying
the
son
i
too
shall
know
his
father
everywhere
o
mother
earth
i
have
a
fear
which
i
would
tell
to
thee
softly
and
gently
in
thine
ear
when
the
moon
and
we
are
three
thy
grass
and
flowers
are
beautiful
among
thy
trees
i
hide
and
underneath
the
moonlight
cool
thy
sea
looks
broad
and
wide
but
this
i
fear
lest
thou
shouldst
grow
to
me
so
small
and
strange
so
distant
i
should
never
know
on
thee
a
shade
of
change
although
great
earthquakes
should
uplift
deep
mountains
from
their
base
and
thy
continual
motion
shift
the
lands
upon
thy
face
the
grass
the
flowers
the
dews
that
lie
upon
them
as
before
driven
upwards
evermore
lest
i
should
love
these
things
no
more
even
now
thou
dimly
hast
a
place
in
deep
star
galaxies
and
i
driven
ever
on
through
space
have
lost
thee
in
the
skies
lost
out
of
thy
door
i
run
to
do
the
thing
that
calls
upon
me
straight
the
wind
of
words
whoops
from
mine
ears
the
sounds
of
them
that
sing
about
their
work
my
god
my
i
turn
in
haste
to
see
thy
blessed
door
but
lo
a
cloud
of
flies
and
bats
and
birds
and
stalking
vapours
and
vague
have
risen
and
lighted
rushed
and
swollen
between
ah
me
the
house
of
peace
is
there
no
more
was
it
a
dream
then
walls
fireside
and
floor
and
sweet
obedience
loving
calm
and
free
are
vanished
gone
as
they
had
never
been
i
labour
groaning
comes
a
sudden
sheen
and
i
am
kneeling
at
my
father
knee
sighing
with
joy
and
hoping
utterly
talk
of
the
a
fragment
when
the
cock
crows
loud
from
the
glen
and
the
chirrs
from
the
heather
what
hear
ye
and
see
ye
then
ye
children
of
air
and
ether
a
thunder
as
of
waves
at
the
rising
of
the
moon
and
a
darkness
on
the
graves
though
the
day
is
at
its
noon
a
springing
as
of
grass
though
the
air
is
damp
and
chill
and
a
glimmer
from
the
river
that
winds
about
the
hill
a
lapse
of
crags
that
leant
from
the
mountain
earthen
sheath
and
a
shock
of
ruin
sent
on
the
river
underneath
a
sound
as
of
a
building
that
groweth
fair
and
good
and
a
piping
of
the
thrushes
from
the
hollow
of
the
wood
a
wailing
as
of
lambs
that
have
wandered
from
the
flock
and
a
bleating
of
their
dams
that
was
answered
from
the
rock
a
breathing
as
of
cattle
in
the
shadow
where
they
dream
and
a
sound
of
children
playing
with
the
pebbles
in
the
stream
a
driving
as
of
clouds
in
the
kingdom
of
the
air
and
a
tumult
as
of
crowds
that
mingle
everywhere
a
waving
of
the
grass
and
a
passing
the
lakes
and
a
shred
of
in
the
glory
when
it
breaks
in
god
alone
the
perfect
end
wilt
thou
find
thyself
or
friend
they
come
to
thee
the
halt
the
maimed
the
blind
the
the
sick
the
sore
thy
heart
their
well
of
life
they
find
thine
ear
their
open
door
ah
who
can
tell
the
joy
in
palestine
what
smiles
and
tears
of
rescued
throngs
their
lees
of
life
were
turned
to
wine
their
prayers
to
shouts
and
songs
the
story
dear
our
wise
men
fable
call
give
paltry
facts
the
mighty
range
to
me
it
seems
just
what
should
fall
and
nothing
very
strange
but
were
i
deaf
and
lame
and
blind
and
sore
i
scarce
would
care
for
cure
to
ask
another
prayer
should
haunt
thy
door
set
thee
a
harder
task
if
thou
art
christ
see
here
this
heart
of
mine
torn
empty
moaning
and
unblest
had
ever
heart
more
need
of
thine
if
thine
indeed
hath
rest
thy
word
thy
hand
right
soon
did
scare
the
bane
that
in
their
bodies
death
did
breed
if
thou
canst
cure
my
deeper
pain
then
art
thou
lord
indeed
that
a
oh
that
a
wind
would
call
from
the
depths
of
the
leafless
wood
oh
that
a
voice
would
fall
on
the
ear
of
my
solitude
far
away
is
the
sea
with
its
sound
and
its
spirit
tone
over
it
white
clouds
flee
but
i
am
alone
alone
straight
and
steady
and
tall
the
trees
stand
on
their
feet
fast
by
the
old
stone
wall
the
moss
grows
green
and
sweet
but
my
heart
is
full
of
fears
for
the
sun
shines
far
away
and
they
look
in
my
face
through
tears
and
the
light
of
a
dying
day
my
heart
was
glad
last
night
as
i
pressed
it
with
my
palm
its
throb
was
airy
and
light
as
it
sang
some
spirit
psalm
but
it
died
away
in
my
breast
as
i
wandered
forth
as
a
bird
sat
dead
on
its
nest
while
others
sang
on
the
spray
o
weary
heart
of
mine
is
there
ever
a
truth
for
thee
will
ever
a
sun
outshine
but
the
sun
that
shines
on
me
away
away
through
the
air
the
clouds
and
the
leaves
are
blown
and
my
heart
hath
need
of
prayer
for
it
sitteth
alone
alone
vision
of
i
see
thy
house
but
i
am
blown
about
a
kite
between
the
earth
and
sky
all
out
of
doors
alas
of
thy
doors
out
and
drenched
in
dews
no
summer
suns
can
dry
for
every
blast
is
passion
of
my
own
the
dews
cold
sweats
of
selfish
agony
dank
vapour
steams
from
memories
lying
prone
and
all
my
soul
is
but
a
stifled
cry
ii
lord
thou
dost
hold
my
string
else
were
i
driven
down
to
some
gulf
where
i
were
tossed
no
more
no
turmoil
telling
i
was
not
in
heaven
no
billows
raving
on
a
blessed
shore
thou
standest
on
thy
calm
as
day
and
all
my
throbs
and
pangs
are
pulls
from
thee
hold
fast
the
string
lest
i
should
break
away
and
outer
dark
and
silence
swallow
me
iii
no
longer
fly
thy
kite
lord
draw
me
home
thou
the
string
through
all
the
distance
bleak
lord
i
am
nearing
thee
o
lord
i
come
thy
pulls
grow
stronger
and
the
wind
grows
weak
in
thy
remodelling
hands
thou
thy
kite
a
moment
to
thy
bosom
me
fast
thou
flingest
me
abroad
lo
in
thy
might
a
bird
i
soar
on
every
blast
the
son
of
i
honour
nature
holding
it
unjust
to
look
with
jealousy
on
her
designs
with
every
passing
year
more
fast
she
twines
about
my
heart
with
her
mysterious
dust
claim
i
a
fellowship
not
less
august
although
she
works
before
me
and
combines
her
changing
forms
wherever
the
sun
shines
spreading
a
leafy
volume
on
the
crust
of
the
old
world
and
man
himself
likewise
is
of
her
making
wherefore
then
divorce
what
god
hath
joined
thus
and
rend
by
force
spirit
away
from
substance
bursting
ties
by
which
in
one
great
bond
of
unity
god
hath
together
bound
all
things
that
be
ii
and
in
these
lines
my
purpose
is
to
show
that
he
who
left
the
father
though
he
came
not
with
or
the
earthly
flame
of
genius
yet
in
that
he
did
bestow
his
own
true
loving
heart
did
cause
to
grow
unseen
and
buried
deep
we
name
the
best
in
human
art
without
the
shame
of
idle
sitting
in
most
real
woe
and
that
of
beautiful
and
grand
the
earth
contains
by
him
was
not
despised
but
rather
was
so
deeply
realized
in
word
and
deed
though
not
with
artist
hand
that
it
was
either
hid
or
all
disguised
from
those
who
were
not
wise
to
understand
iii
art
is
the
bond
of
weakness
and
we
find
therein
acknowledgment
of
failing
power
a
man
would
worship
gazing
on
a
flower
onward
he
passeth
lo
his
eyes
are
blind
the
unenlivened
form
he
left
behind
grew
up
within
him
only
for
an
hour
and
he
will
grapple
with
nature
till
the
dower
of
strength
shall
be
retreasured
in
his
mind
and
each
is
a
high
protest
of
treason
done
unto
the
soul
of
man
which
striving
upwards
ever
is
by
the
old
bondage
underneath
whose
ban
he
failing
in
his
struggle
for
the
best
must
live
in
pain
upon
what
food
he
can
iv
moreover
were
there
perfect
harmony
soul
and
nature
we
should
never
waste
the
precious
hours
in
gazing
but
should
haste
to
assimilate
her
offerings
and
we
from
high
as
doth
the
tree
should
grow
to
higher
so
what
we
call
taste
is
a
slow
living
as
of
roots
encased
in
the
grim
chinks
of
some
sterility
both
cramping
and
withholding
art
is
truth
but
truth
dammed
up
and
frozen
gagged
and
bound
as
is
a
streamlet
icy
and
uncouth
which
pebbles
hath
and
channel
but
no
sound
give
it
again
its
summer
heart
of
youth
and
it
will
be
a
life
upon
the
ground
and
love
had
not
been
prisoned
in
cold
stone
nor
beauty
smeared
on
the
dead
canvas
so
had
not
their
worshipper
been
forced
to
go
questful
and
restless
through
the
world
alone
searching
but
finding
not
till
on
him
shone
back
from
his
own
deep
heart
a
chilly
glow
as
of
a
sunbeam
or
of
snow
under
a
crescent
which
hath
grown
wasted
to
mockery
and
beneath
such
gleam
his
wan
conceits
have
found
an
utterance
which
had
they
found
a
true
and
sunny
beam
had
ripened
into
real
touch
and
glance
nay
more
to
real
deed
the
truth
of
all
to
some
perfection
high
and
personal
vi
but
yet
the
great
of
soul
have
ever
been
the
first
to
glory
in
all
works
of
art
for
from
the
would
ever
dart
a
light
of
inspiration
and
a
sheen
as
of
new
comings
and
ourselves
have
seen
men
of
stern
purpose
to
whose
eyes
would
start
sorrow
at
sight
of
sorrow
though
no
heart
did
riot
underneath
that
chilly
screen
and
hence
we
judge
such
utterance
native
to
the
human
soul
expression
highest
best
nay
it
is
by
such
sign
they
will
pursue
albeit
unknowing
beauty
without
rest
and
failing
in
the
search
themselves
will
fling
speechless
before
its
shadow
worshipping
vii
and
how
shall
he
whose
mission
is
to
bring
the
soul
to
worship
at
its
rightful
shrine
seeing
in
beauty
what
is
most
divine
give
out
the
mightiest
impulse
and
thus
fling
his
soul
into
the
future
scattering
the
living
seed
of
wisdom
shall
there
shine
from
underneath
his
hand
a
matchless
line
of
high
till
the
wide
world
ring
with
the
far
clang
that
tells
a
missioned
soul
kneeling
to
homage
all
about
his
feet
alas
for
such
a
gift
were
this
the
whole
the
only
bread
of
life
men
had
to
eat
lo
i
behold
them
dead
about
him
now
and
him
the
heart
of
death
for
all
that
brow
viii
if
didst
pass
by
art
thou
didst
not
scorn
the
souls
that
by
such
symbol
yearned
in
vain
from
truth
and
love
true
nourishment
to
gain
on
thy
warm
breast
so
chilly
and
forlorn
fell
these
thy
nurslings
little
more
than
born
that
thou
wast
anguished
and
there
fell
a
rain
from
thy
blest
eyelids
and
in
grief
and
pain
thou
partedst
from
them
yet
one
night
and
morn
to
find
them
wholesome
food
and
nourishment
instead
of
what
their
blindness
took
for
such
laying
thyself
a
seed
in
earthen
rent
from
which
outspringing
to
the
willing
touch
riseth
for
all
thy
children
harvest
great
for
which
they
will
all
learn
to
bless
thee
yet
iv
thou
sawest
beauty
in
the
streaking
cloud
when
grief
lift
up
those
eyelids
nor
in
scorn
broke
ever
on
thine
eyes
the
purple
morn
along
the
cedar
tops
to
thee
aloud
spake
the
when
hushed
and
bowed
the
earth
lay
at
thy
feet
stony
and
worn
loving
thou
markedst
when
the
lamb
unshorn
was
glad
before
thee
and
amongst
the
crowd
famished
and
pent
in
cities
did
thine
eye
read
strangest
glory
though
in
human
art
no
record
lives
to
tell
us
that
thy
heart
bowed
to
its
own
deep
beauty
deeper
did
lie
the
burden
of
thy
mission
even
whereby
we
know
that
beauty
liveth
where
thou
art
x
doubtless
thine
eyes
have
watched
the
sun
aspire
from
that
same
olivet
when
back
on
thee
flushed
upwards
after
some
thy
proper
godhead
with
a
purer
fire
purpling
thy
infinite
and
in
strong
desire
thou
sattest
in
the
dawn
that
was
to
be
uplifted
on
our
dark
perplexity
yea
in
thee
lay
thy
soul
a
living
lyre
and
each
wild
beauty
smote
it
though
the
sound
rung
to
the
oft
and
desert
air
beneath
thine
eyes
the
lily
paled
more
fair
and
each
still
shadow
slanting
on
the
ground
lay
sweetly
on
thee
as
commissioned
there
so
full
wast
thou
of
eyes
all
round
and
round
xi
and
so
thou
neededst
not
our
human
skill
to
fix
what
thus
were
transient
there
it
grew
wedded
to
thy
perfection
and
anew
with
every
coming
vision
rose
there
still
some
living
principle
which
did
fulfil
thy
most
legitimate
manhood
and
unto
thy
soul
all
nature
rendered
up
its
due
with
not
a
contradiction
and
each
hill
and
mountain
torrent
and
each
wandering
light
grew
out
divinely
on
thy
countenance
whereon
as
we
are
told
by
word
and
glance
thy
hearers
read
an
ever
strange
delight
so
strange
to
them
thy
truth
they
could
not
tell
what
made
thy
message
so
unspeakable
xii
and
by
such
living
witness
didst
thou
preach
not
with
blind
hands
of
groping
forward
thrust
into
the
darkness
gathering
only
dust
but
by
this
real
sign
that
thou
didst
reach
in
natural
order
rising
each
from
each
thy
own
ideals
of
the
true
and
just
and
that
as
thou
didst
live
even
so
he
must
who
would
aspire
his
to
teach
looking
perpetual
from
new
heights
of
thought
on
his
old
self
of
art
no
scorner
thou
instead
of
leafy
chaplet
on
thy
brow
wearing
the
light
of
manhood
thou
hast
brought
death
unto
life
above
all
statues
now
immortal

hail
thy
work

wrought
xiii
solemn
and
icy
stand
ye
in
my
eyes
far
up
into
the
niches
of
the
past
ye
marble
statues
dim
and
holden
fast

stony
homes

shook
you
from

frozen
phantasies

through

bulks

new
from

that
wondrous
charm
as
he
with
human
heart
and
hand
and
eye
walked
sorrowing
upon
our
highways
then
the
eternal
father
living
gift
to
men
xiv
as
the
pent
torrent
in
uneasy
rest
under
the
griping
rocks
doth
ever
keep
a
monstrous
working
as
it
lies
asleep
in
the
round
hollow
of
some
mountain
breast
till
where
it
hideth
in
its
sweltering
nest
some
earthquake
finds
it
and
its
waters
leap
forth
to
the
sunshine
down
the
mighty
steep
so
in
thee
once
was
anguished
forth
the
quest
whereby
man
sought
for
as
he
lay
under
his
own
proud
heart
and
black
despair
wedged
fast
and
stifled
up
with
loads
of
care
yet
at
dumb
struggle
with
the
tyrant
clay
thou
wentest
down
below
the
roots
of
prayer
and
he
hath
cried
aloud
since
that
same
day
xv
as
he
that
parts
in
hatred
from
a
friend
mixing
with
other
men
forgets
the
woe
which
anguished
him
when
he
beheld
and
lo
two
souls
had
fled
asunder
which
did
bend
under
the
same
blue
heaven
yet
ere
the
end
when
the
loud
world
hath
tossed
him
to
and
fro
will
often
strangely
reappear
that
glow
at
simplest
memory
which
some
chance
may
send
although
much
stronger
bonds
have
lost
their
power
so
thou
didst
come
in
lowly
guise
striking
on
simple
chords
not
with
surprise
or
mightiest
recollectings
in
that
hour
but
like
remembered
fragrance
of
a
flower
a
man
with
human
heart
and
loving
eyes

thou

fair

thou
call
through
death

i

thou

my

my
beating

said

me
thou
seest
the

how
calm
and
bright
the
world
is
fair
by
day
and

but
what
is
that
to
thee
one

all

all

only
i
one
little
touch
and
all
is
dark
the
winter
with
its
sparkling
moons
the
spring
with
all
her
violets
the
crimson
dawns
and
rich
sunsets
the
autumn
yellowing
noons
i
only
toss
my
purple
jets
and
thou
art
one
that
swoons
upon
a
night
of
gust
and
roar
shipwrecked
among
the
waves
and
seems
across
the
purple
hills
to
roam
sweet
odours

downward
sinking

downward
spray

hovering
iris
span
the
marble
tank
which
as
the
wind
came
ever
rose
and
sank
violet
and
red
so
my
continual
play
makes
beauty
for
the
gods
with
many
a
prank
of
human
excellence
while
they
weary
of
all
the

in

upgathers

limbs
serenely
blest
lulled

noise

unrest
one
heart
beats
in

differing

in
the
work
it
works
its
doubts
and
clamours
are
but
the
waste
and
brunt
of
instruments
wherewith
a
work
is
done
or
as
the
hammers
on
forge
cyclopean
plied
beneath
the
rents
of
lowest

conquering
into

the
hard
and
scattered
ore
choose
thou
narcotics
and
the
dizzy
grape
outworking
passion
lest
with
horrid
crash
thy
life
go
from
thee
in
a
night
of
pain
so
tutoring
thy
vision
shall
the
flash
of
dove
be
to
thee
no
more
than
a
white
stone
heavy
upon
the
plain
hark
the
cock
crows
loud
and
without
all
ghastly
and
ill
like
a
man
uplift
in
his
shroud
the
white
white
morn
is
propped
on
the
hill
and
adown
from
the
eaves
pointed
and
chill
the
icicles
to
glitter
and
the
birds
with
a
warble
short
and
shrill
pass
by
the
still
with
a
quick
uneasy
twitter
let
me
pump
warm
blood
for
the
cold

bitter
and
wearily
wearily
one
by

men
awake
with
the
weary
sun
life
is
a
phantom
shut
in
thee
i
am
the
master
and
keep
the
key
so
let
me
toss
thee
the
days
of
old
crimson
and
orange
and
green
and
gold
so
let
me
fill
thee
yet
again
with
a
rush
of
dreams
from
my
spout
amain
for
all
is
mine
all
is
my
own
toss
the
purple
fountain
high
the
breast
of
man
is
a
vat
of
stone
and
i
am
alive
i
only
i
the
lord
according
to
thy
words
i
have
considered
thy
birds
and
i
find
their
life
good
and
better
the
better
understood
sowing
neither
corn
nor
wheat
they
have
all
that
they
can
eat
reaping
no
more
than
they
sow
they
have
more
than
they
could
stow
having
neither
barn
nor
store
hungry
again
they
eat
more
considering
i
see
too
that
they
have
a
busy
life
and
plenty
of
play
in
the
earth
they
dig
their
bills
deep
and
work
well
though
they
do
not
heap
then
to
play
in
the
air
they
are
not
loath
and
their
nests
between
are
better
than
both
but
this
is
when
there
blow
no
storms
when
berries
are
plenty
in
winter
and
worms
when
feathers
are
rife
with
oil
enough
to
keep
the
cold
out
and
send
the
rain
off
if
there
come
indeed
a
long
hard
frost
then
it
looks
as
thy
birds
were
lost
but
i
consider
further
and
find
a
hungry
bird
has
a
free
mind
he
is
hungry
not
steals
no
comfort
no
grief
doth
borrow
this
moment
is
his
thy
will
hath
said
it
the
next
is
nothing
till
thou
hast
made
it
thy
bird
has
pain
but
has
no
fear
which
is
the
worst
of
any
gear
when
cold
and
hunger
and
harm
betide
him
he
does
not
take
them
and
stuff
inside
him
content
with
the
day
ill
he
has
got
he
waits
just
nor
haggles
with
his
lot
neither
jumbles
god
will
with
driblets
from
his
own
still
but
next
i
see
in
my
endeavour
thy
birds
here
do
not
live
for
ever
that
cold
or
hunger
sickness
or
age
finishes
their
earthly
stage
the
rooks
drop
in
cold
nights
leaving
all
their
wrongs
and
rights
birds
lie
here
and
birds
lie
there
with
their
feathers
all
astare
and
in
thy
own
sermon
thou
that
the
sparrow
falls
dost
allow
it
shall
not
cause
me
any
alarm
for
neither
so
comes
the
bird
to
harm
seeing
our
father
thou
hast
said
is
by
the
sparrow
dying
bed
therefore
it
is
a
blessed
place
and
the
sparrow
in
high
grace
it
cometh
therefore
to
this
lord
i
have
considered
thy
word

henceforth
will
be

london
here
is
a
temple
strangely
wrought
within
it
i
can
see
two
spirits
of
a
diverse
thought
contend
for
mastery
one
is
an
angel
fair
and
bright
adown
the
aisle
comes
he
adown
the
aisle
in
raiment
white
a
creature
fair
to
see
the
other
wears
an
evil
mien
and
he
hath
doubtless
slipt
a
fearful
being
dark
and
lean
up
from
the
mouldy
crypt
is
that
the
roof
that
grows
so
black
did
some
one
call
my
name
was
it
the
bursting
thunder
crack
that
filled
this
place
with
flame
i
move
i
wake
from
out
my
sleep
some
one
hath
victor
been
i
see
two
radiant
pinions
sweep
and
i
am
borne
between
beneath
the
clouds
that
under
roll
an
upturned
face
i
see
a
dead
man
face
but
ah
the
soul
was
right
well
known
to
me
a
man
dead
face
away
i
haste
through
regions
calm
and
fair
go
vanquish
sin
and
thou
shall
taste
the
same
celestial
air
the
fashion
of
an
old
i
have
long
enough
been
working
down
in
my
cellar
working
spade
and
pick
and
drill
i
long
for
wider
spaces
airy
and
stellar
successless
labour
never
the
love
of
it
did
fill
more
profit
surely
lies
in
a
holy
pure
quiescence
in
a
setting
forth
of
cups
to
catch
the
heavenly
rain
in
a
yielding
of
the
being
to
the
ever
waiting
presence
in
a
lifting
of
the
eyes
upward
homeward
again
up
to
my
garret
its
and
skylights
there
i
lay
me
on
the
floor
and
patient
let
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
stars
the
blueness
and
the
twilights
do
what
their
pleasure
is
and
wait
till
they
have
done
but
lo
i
hear
a
waving
on
the
roof
of
great
pinions
is
the
labour
of
a
windmill
to
the
wind
lo
down
there
goes
shaft
through
all
the
i
trace
it
to
a
cellar
whose
door
i
can
not
find
but
there
i
hear
ever
a
keen
in
motion
now
fast
and
now
slow
as
the
wind
sits
in
the
sails
drilling
and
boring
to
the
far
eternal
ocean
the
living
well
of
all
wells
whose
water
never
fails
so
now
i
go
no
more
to
the
cellar
to
my
labour
but
up
to
my
garret
where
those
arms
are
ever
going
there
the
sky
is
ever
me
and
the
wind
my
blessed
neighbour
and
the
ready
turns
the
sails
to
its
blowing
blow
blow
my
blessed
wind
oh
keep
ever
blowing
keep
the
great
windmill
going
full
and
free
so
shall
the
down
below
keep
going
till

quiet

ye
aught
to

take
no

i
am
half
afraid
in

ghostly
night
if
ye
all
obeyed
i
should
fear
you
quite
but
when
day
is
breaking
in
the
purple
east
i
would
meet
you
waking
one
of
you
at

when
the
sun
is
tipping
every
stony
block
and
the
sun
is
slipping
down
the
weathercock

quiet
dead
i
will
not
perplex
you
what
my
tongue
hath
said
haply
it
may
vex
you
yet
i
hear
you
speaking
with
a
quiet
speech
as
if
ye
were
seeking
better
things
to
teach
wait
a
little
longer
suffer
and
endure
till
your
heart
is
stronger
and
your

are
pure
a
little
longer
brother
with
your
we
will
meet
each
other
otherwhere
again
your
light
so
sometimes
o
lord
thou
lightest
in
my
head
a
lamp
that
well
might
pharos
all
the
lands
anon
the
light
will
neither
rise
nor
spread
shrouded
in
danger
gray
the
beacon
stands
a
pharos
oh
dull
brain
poor
dying
lamp
under
a
bushel
with
an
earthy
smell
mouldering
it
stands
in
rust
and
eating
damp
while
the
slow
oil
keeps
oozing
from
its
cell
for
me
it
were
enough
to
be
a
flower
knowing
its
root
in
thee
the
living
hid
ordained
to
blossom
at
the
appointed
hour
and
wake
or
sleep
as
thou
my
nature
bid
but
hear
my
brethren
in
their
darkling
fright
hearten
my
lamp
that
it
may
shine
abroad
then
will
they
cry
lo
there
is
something
bright
who
kindled
it
if
not
the
shining
god
when
the
heart
is
a
cup
in
the
body
low
lying
and
wine
drop
by
drop
falls
into
that
cup
from
somewhere
high
up
it
is
good
to
be
dying
with
the
heart
for
a
cup
in
the
body
low
lying
souls
see
how
the
storm
of
life
ascends
up
through
the
shadow
of
the
world
beyond
our
gaze
the
line
extends
like
wreaths
of
vapour
grasp
tighter
brother
lest
the
storm
should
sweep
us
down
from
where
we
stand
and
we
may
catch
some
human
form
we
know
amongst
the
straining
band
see
see
in
yonder
misty
cloud
one
whirlwind
sweep
and
we
shall
hear
the
voice
that
waxes
yet
more
loud
and
louder
still
approaching
near
tremble
not
brother
fear
not
thou
for
yonder
wild
and
mystic
strain
will
bring
before
us
strangely
now
the
visions
of
our
youth
again
listen
oh
listen
see
how
its
eyeballs
roll
and
glisten
with
a
wild
and
fearful
stare
upwards
through
the
shining
air
or
backwards
with
averted
look
as
a
child
were
gazing
at
a
book
full
of
tales
of
fear
and
dread
when
the
thick
came
hollow
and
dead
round
about
it
wavering
and
light
as
the
moths
flock
round
a
candle
at
night
a
crowd
of
phantoms
sheeted
and
dumb
strain
to
its
words
as
they
shrilly
come
brother
my
brother
dost
thou
hear
they
pierce
through
the
tumult
sharp
and
clear
the
rush
of
speed
is
on
my
soul
my
eyes
are
blind
with
things
i
see
i
can
not
grasp
the
awful
whole
i
can
not
gird
the
mystery
the
mountains
sweep
like
mist
away
the
great
sea
shakes
like
flakes
of
fire
the
rush
of
things
i
can
not
see
is
mounting
upward
higher
and
higher
oh
life
was
still
and
full
of
calm
in
yonder
spot
of
earthly
ground
but
now
it
rolls
a
its
voices
drown
my
ear
in
sound
would
god
i
were
a
child
again
to
nurse
the
seeds
of
faith
and
power
i
might
have
clasped
in
wisdom
then
a
wing
to
beat
this
awful
hour
the
dullest
things
would
take
my
marks
took
my
marks
like
drifted
snow
god
how
the
footsteps
rise
in
sparks
rise
like
myself
and
onward
go
have
pity
o
ye
driving
things
that
once
like
me
had
human
form
for
i
am
driven
for
lack
of
wings
a
shreddy
cloud
before
the
storm
how
its
words
went
through
me
then
like
a
long
forgotten
pang
till
the
storm
embrace
again
swept
it
far
with
sudden
clang
ah
methinks
i
see
it
still
let
us
follow
it
my
brother
keeping
close

closer
closer
side
by
side
ours
are
wings
that
deftly
glide
upwards
downwards
and
crosswise
flashing
past
our
ears
and
eyes
splitting
up
the
with
a
whirlwind
at
our
backs
how
the
sky
is
blackening
yet
the
race
is
never
slackening
swift
continual
and
strong
streams
the
torrent
slope
along
like
a
tidal
surge
of
faces
molten
into
one
despair
each
the
other
now
displaces
a
continual
whirl
of
spaces
ah
my
fainting
eyesight
reels
as
i
strive
in
vain
to
stare
on
a
thousand
turning
wheels
dimly
in
the
gloom
descending
faces
with
each
other
blending
let
us
beat
the
vapours
back
we
are
yet
upon
his
track
didst
thou
see
a
spirit
halt
upright
on
a
cloudy
peak
as
the
lightning
horrid
fault
smote
a
gash
into
the
cheek
of
the
grinning
which
doth
still
besiege
and
crowd
upward
from
the
nether
pits
where
the
monster
chaos
sits
building
the
fleeing
rack
roofs
of
thunder
long
and
black
yes
i
see
it
i
will
shout
till
i
stop
the
horrid
rout
ho
ho
tell
is
thy
path
to
heaven
or
hell
we
would
hear
thee
yet
again
what
thy
standing
amongst
men
what
thy
former
history
and
thy
hope
of
things
to
be
wisdom
still
we
gain
from
hearing
we
would
know
we
would
know
whither
thou
art
steering
unto
weal
or
woe
ah
i
can
not
hear
it
speaking
yet
it
seems
as
it
were
seeking
through
our
eyes
our
souls
to
reach
with
a
quaint
mysterious
speech
as
with
stretched
and
crossing
palms
one
were
tracing
diagrams
on
the
ebbing
of
the
beach
till
with
wild
unmeasured
dance
all
the
tiptoe
waves
advance
seize
him
by
the
shoulder
cover
turn
him
up
and
toss
him
over
he
is
vanished
from
our
sight
nothing
mars
the
quiet
night
save
a
speck
of
gloom
afar
like
the
ruin
of
a
star
brother
streams
it
ever
so
such
a
torrent
tide
of
woe
ah
i
know
not
let
us
haste
upwards
from
this
dreary
waste
up
to
where
like
music
flowing
gentler
feet
are
ever
going
streams
of
life
encircling
run
round
about
the
up
beyond
the
storm
and
rush
with
our
lesson
let
us
rise
lo
the
morning
golden
flush
meets
us
midway
in
the
skies
perished
all
the
dream
and
strife
death
is
swallowed
up
of
life
the
stars
are
all
watching
god
angel
is
catching
at
thy
skirts
in
the
darkness
deep
gold
hinges
grating
the
mighty
dead
waiting
why
dost
thou
sleep
years
without
number
ages
of
slumber
stiff
in
the
track
of
the
infinite
one
dead
can
i
think
it
dropt
like
a
trinket
a
thing
whose
uses
are
done
white
wings
are
crossing
glad
waves
are
tossing
the
earth
flames
out
in
crimson
and
green
spring
is
appearing
summer
is
nearing
where
hast
thou
been
down
in
some
cavern
death
sleepy
tavern
housing
carousing
with
spectres
of
night
there
is
my
right
hand
grasp
it
full
tight
and
spring
to
the
light
wonder
oh
wonder
how
the
bursts
on
his
ear
in
horror
and
dread
happy
shapes
meet
him
heaven
and
earth
greet
him
life
from
the
dead
an
seek
not
my
name
it
doth
no
virtue
bear
seek
seek
thine
own
primeval
name
to
find
the
name
god
called
when
thy
ideal
fair
arose
in
deeps
of
the
eternal
mind
when
that
thou
findest
thou
art
straight
a
lord
of
time
and
space
art
heir
of
all
things
grown
and
not
my
name
poor
earthly
but
i
myself
thenceforward
am
thine
own
thou
hearest
not
or
hearest
as
a
man
who
hears
the
muttering
of
a
foolish
spell
my
very
shadow
would
feel
strange
and
wan
in
thy
abode
i
say
and
thou
understandest
then
it
is
enough
no
shall
mock
my
friend
we
walk
the
same
path
over
smooth
and
rough
to
meet
ere
long
at
the
unending
end
a
copy
of
in
memoriam
to
ii
dear
friend
you
love
the
poet
song
and
here
is
one
for
your
regard
you
know
the
melancholy
bard
whose
grief
is
wise
as
well
as
strong
already
something
understand
for
whom
he
mourns
and
what
he
sings
and
how
he
wakes
with
golden
strings
the
echoes
of
the
silent
land
how
restless
faint
and
worn
with
grief
yet
loving
all
and
hoping
all
he
gazes
where
the
shadows
fall
and
finds
in
darkness
some
relief
and
how
he
sends
his
cries
across
his
cries
for
him
that
comes
no
more
till
one
might
think
that
silent
shore
full
of
the
burden
of
his
loss
and
how
there
comes
sublimer
cheer
not
darkness
solacing
sad
eyes
not
the
wild
joy
of
mournful
cries
but
light
that
makes
his
spirit
clear
how
while
he
gazes
something
high
something
of
heaven
has
fallen
on
him
his
distance
and
his
future
dim
broken
into
a
dawning
sky
something
of
this
dear
friend
you
know
and
will
you
take
the
book
from
me
that
holds
this
mournful
melody
and
softens
grief
to
sadness
so
perhaps
it
scarcely
suits
the
day
of
joyful
hopes
and
memories
clear
when
love
should
have
no
thought
of
fear
and
only
smiles
be
round
your
way
yet
from
the
mystery
and
the
gloom
from
tempted
faith
and
conquering
trust
from
spirit
stronger
than
the
dust
and
love
that
looks
beyond
the
tomb
what
can
there
be
but
good
to
win
but
hope
for
life
but
love
for
all
but
strength
whatever
may
befall
so
for
the
year
that
you
begin
for
all
the
years
that
follow
this
while
a
long
happy
life
endures
this
hope
this
love
this
strength
be
yours
and
afterwards
a
larger
bliss
may
nothing
in
this
mournful
song
too
much
take
off
your
thoughts
from
time
for
joy
should
fill
your
vernal
prime
and
peace
your
summer
mild
and
long
and
may
his
love
who
can
restore
all
losses
give
all
new
good
things
like
loving
eyes
and
sheltering
wings
be
round
us
all
for
evermore
are
they
are
blind
and
they
are
dead
we
will
wake
them
as
we
go
there
are
words
have
not
been
said
there
are
sounds
they
do
not
know
we
will
pipe
and
we
will
sing
with
the
music
and
the
spring
set
their
hearts
a
wondering
they
are
tired
of
what
is
old
we
will
give
it
voices
new
for
the
half
hath
not
been
told
of
the
beautiful
and
true
drowsy
eyelids
shut
and
sleeping
heavy
eyes
oppressed
with
weeping
flashes
through
the
lashes
leaping
ye
that
have
a
pleasant
voice
hither
come
without
delay
ye
will
never
have
a
choice
like
to
that
ye
have
round
the
wide
world
we
will
go
singing
through
the
frost
and
snow
till
the
daisies
are
in
blow
ye
that
can
not
pipe
or
sing
ye
must
also
come
with
speed
ye
must
come
and
with
you
bring
weighty
word
and
weightier
deed
helping
hands
and
loving
eyes
these
will
make
them
truly
wise
then
will
be
our
paradise
the
storm
was
when
the
storm
was
proudest
and
the
wind
was
loudest
i
heard
the
hollow
caverns
drinking
down
below
when
the
stars
were
bright
and
the
ground
was
white
i
heard
the
grasses
springing
underneath
the
snow
many
voices
spake
the
river
to
the
lake
and
the
sky
was
talking
to
the
sea
and
every
starry
spark
made
music
with
the
dark
and
said
how
bright
and
beautiful
everything
must
be
when
the
sun
was
setting
all
the
clouds
were
getting
beautiful
and
silvery
in
the
rising
moon
beneath
the
leafless
trees
wrangling
in
the
breeze
i
could
hardly
see
them
for
the
leaves
of
june
when
the
day
had
ended
and
the
night
descended
i
heard
the
sound
of
streams
that
i
heard
not
through
the
day
and
every
peak
afar
was
ready
for
a
star
and
they
climbed
and
rolled
around
until
the
morning
gray
then
slumber
soft
and
holy
came
down
upon
me
slowly
and
i
went
i
know
not
whither
and
i
lived
i
know
not
how
my
glory
had
been
banished
for
when
i
woke
it
vanished
but
i
waited
on
its
coming
and
i
am
waiting
now
from
schiller
which
of
you
knight
or
squire
will
dare
plunge
into
yonder
gulf
a
golden
beaker
i
fling
in
it
there
the
black
mouth
swallows
it
like
a
wolf
who
brings
me
the
cup
again
whoever
it
is
his
own
he
may
keep
it
for
ever
is
the
king
who
speaks
he
flings
from
the
brow
of
the
cliff
that
rugged
and
steep
hangs
out
the
endless
sea
below
the
cup
in
the
whirlpool
howling
heap
again
i
ask
what
hero
will
follow
what
hero
plunge
into
yon
dark
hollow
the
knights
and
the
squires
the
king
about
hear
and
dumbly
stare
into
the
wild
sea
tumbling
rout
to
win
the
beaker
they
hardly
care
the
king
for
the
third
time
round
him
glaring
not
one
soul
of
you
has
the
daring
speechless
all
as
before
they
stand
then
a
squire
young
gentle
gay
steps
from
his
comrades
shrinking
band
flinging
his
girdle
and
cloak
away
and
all
the
women
and
men
that
surrounded
gazed
on
the
noble
youth
astounded
and
when
he
stepped
to
the
rock
rough
brow
and
looked
down
on
the
gulf
so
black
the
waters
which
it
had
swallowed
now
charybdis
bellowing
rendered
back
and
with
a
roar
as
of
distant
thunder
foaming
they
burst
from
the
dark
lap
under
it
wallows
seethes
hisses
in
raging
rout
as
when
water
wrestles
with
fire
till
to
heaven
the
yeasty
tongues
they
spout
and
flood
upon
flood
keeps
mounting
higher
it
will
never
its
endless
coil
unravel
as
the
sea
with
another
sea
were
in
travail
but
at
last
slow
sinks
the
writhing
spasm
and
black
through
the
foaming
white
downward
gapes
a
yawning
chasm
bottomless
cloven
to
hell
wide
night
and
sucked
up
see
the
billows
roaring
down
through
the
whirling
funnel
pouring
then
in
haste
ere
the
return
again
the
youth
to
his
god
doth
pray
and
ascends
a
cry
of
horror
and
pain
already
the
vortex
hath
swept
him
away
and
the
bold
swimmer
in
darkness
eternal
close
the
great
jaws
of
the
gulf
infernal
then
the
water
above
grows
smooth
as
glass
while
below
dull
roarings
ply
and
trembling
they
hear
the
murmur
pass
youth
farewell
and
hollower
still
comes
the
howl
affraying
till
their
hearts
are
sick
with
the
frightful
delaying
if
the
crown
itself
thou
in
should
fling
and
say
who
back
with
it
hies
himself
shall
wear
it
and
shall
be
king
i
would
not
covet
the
precious
prize
what
ocean
hides
in
that
howling
hell
of
it
live
soul
will
never
come
back
to
tell
of
it
ships
many
caught
in
that
whirling
surge
shot
sheer
to
their
dismal
doom
keel
and
mast
only
did
ever
emerge
shattered
from
out
the
tomb
like
the
bluster
of
tempest
clearer
and
clearer
comes
its
roaring
nearer
and
ever
nearer
it
wallows
seethes
hisses
in
raging
rout
as
when
water
wrestles
with
fire
till
to
heaven
the
yeasty
tongues
they
spout
wave
upon
wave
back
mounting
higher
and
as
with
the
grumble
of
distant
thunder
bellowing
it
bursts
from
the
dark
lap
under
and
see
from
its
bosom
flowing
dark
something
heave
up
an
arm
and
a
shining
neck
they
mark
and
it
rows
with
never
relaxing
might
it
is
he
and
high
his
golden
capture
his
left
hand
waves
in
success
rapture
with
long
deep
breaths
his
path
he
ploughed
and
he
hailed
the
heavenly
day
jubilant
shouted
the
gazing
crowd
he
lives
he
is
there
he
broke
away
out
of
the
grave
the
whirlpool
uproarious
the
hero
hath
rescued
his
life
victorious
he
comes
they
surround
him
with
shouts
of
glee
at
the
king
feet
he
sinks
on
the
sod
and
hands
him
the
beaker
upon
his
knee
to
his
lovely
daughter
the
king
gives
a
nod
she
fills
it
of
wine
sparkling
and
playing
and
then
to
the
king
the
youth
turned
him
saying
long
live
the
king
well
doth
he
fare
who
breathes
in
this
rosy
light
but
ah
it
is
horrible
down
there
and
man
must
not
tempt
the
heavenly
might
or
ever
seek
with
prying
unwholesome
what
he
graciously
covers
with
darkness
dolesome
it
tore
me
down
with
a
headlong
swing
then
a
shaft
in
a
rock
outpours
against
me
a
torrent
spring
it
seized
me
the
double
stream
raging
force
and
like
a
top
with
giddy
twisting
it
spun
me
round
there
was
no
resisting
then
god
did
show
me
sore
beseeching
in
deepest
frightfullest
need
up
from
the
bottom
a
reaching
at
it
i
caught
and
from
death
was
freed
and
behold
on
spiked
corals
the
beaker
suspended
which
had
else
to
the
very
abyss
descended
for
below
me
it
lay
yet
the
purply
darksome
maw
and
though
to
the
ear
it
was
dead
asleep
the
ghasted
eye
down
staring
saw
how
with
dragons
lizards
salamanders
crawling
the
horrible
were
sprawling
black
swarming
in
medley
miscreate
in
masses
lumped
hideously
wallowed
the
conger
the
thorny
skate
the
lobster
grisly
deformity
and
bared
its
teeth
with
cruel
sheen
a
terrible
shark
the
sea
hyena
and
there
i
hung
and
shuddering
knew
that
human
help
was
none
one
thinking
soul
mid
the
horrid
crew
in
the
ghastly
solitude
i
was
alone
deeper
than
man
speech
ever
sounded
by
the
waste
sea
dismal
monsters
surrounded
i
thought
and
shivered
then
something
crept
near
moved
at
once
a
hundred
joints
now
it
will
have
me
frantic
with
fear
i
lost
my
grasp
of
the
coral
points
away
the
whirl
in
its
raging
tore
me
but
it
was
my
salvation
and
upward
bore
me
the
king
at
the
tale
is
filled
with
amaze
the
beaker
well
won
is
thine
and
this
ring
i
will
give
thee
too
he
says
precious
with
gems
that
are
more
than
fine
if
thou
dive
yet
once
and
bring
me
the
story
what
thou
sawst
in
the
sea
lowest
repertory
his
daughter
she
hears
with
a
tender
dismay
and
her
words
plead
father
enough
of
this
cruel
play
for
you
he
has
done
an
deed
and
can
you
not
master
your
soul
desire
the
knights
turn
now
to
disgrace
the
squire
the
king
he
snatches
and
hurls
the
cup
into
the
swirling
pool
if
thou
bring
me
once
more
that
beaker
up
my
best
knight
i
hold
thee
most
worshipful
and
this
very
day
to
thy
home
thou
shall
lead
her
who
there
for
thee
stands
such
a
pitying
pleader
a
heavenly
passion
his
being
invades
his
eyes
dart
a
lightning
ray
he
sees
on
her
beauty
the
flushing
shades
he
sees
her
grow
pallid
and
sink
away
determination
thorough
him
flashes
and
downward
for
life
or
for
death
he
dashes
they
hear
the
dull
roar
it
is
turning
again
its
herald
the
thunderous
brawl
downward
they
bend
with
loving
strain
they
come
they
are
coming
the
waters
all
they
rush
up
they
rush
down
up
down
for
ever
the
youth
again
bring
they
never
the
through
the
unchanging
heaven
as
ye
have
sped
speed
onward
still
a
strange
wild
company
fleet
children
of
the
waters
glorious
ye
whether
the
sun
lift
up
his
shining
head
high
throned
at
noontide
and
established
among
the
shifting
pillars
or
we
see
the
sable
ghosts
of
air
sleep
mournfully
against
the
sunlight
passionless
and
dead
take
thus
a
glory
oh
thou
higher
sun
from
all
the
cloudy
labour
of
man
hand
whether
the
quickening
nations
rise
and
run
or
in
the
we
idly
stand
casting
huge
shadows
over
these
thy
plains
even
thence
o
god
draw
thy
rich
gifts
of
rains
rich
is
the
fancy
which
can
double
back
all
seeming
forms
and
from
cold
icicles
build
up
high
glittering
palaces
where
dwells
summer
perfection
moulding
all
this
wrack
to
spirit
symmetry
and
doth
not
lack
the
power
to
hear
amidst
the
funeral
bells
the
eternal
heart
which
swells
in
whirlwind
flashes
all
along
its
track
so
hath
the
sun
made
all
the
winter
mine
with
gardens
springing
round
me
fresh
and
fair
on
hidden
leaves
uncounted
jewels
shine
i
live
with
forms
of
beauty
everywhere
peopling
the
crumbling
waste
and
icy
pool
with
sights
and
sounds
of
life
most
beautiful
tumultuous
rushing
the
outstretched
plains
a
wildered
maze
of
comets
and
of
suns
the
blood
of
changeless
god
that
ever
runs
with
quick
diastole
up
the
immortal
veins
a
phantom
host
that
moves
and
works
in
chains
a
monstrous
fiction
which
collapsing
stuns
the
mind
to
stupor
and
amaze
at
once
a
tragedy
which
that
man
best
explains
who
rushes
blindly
on
his
wild
career
with
trampling
hoofs
and
sound
of
mailed
war
who
will
not
nurse
a
life
to
win
a
tear
but
is
extinguished
like
a
falling
star
such
will
at
times
this
life
appear
to
me
until
i
learn
to
read
more
perfectly
il
if
thou
art
tempted
by
a
thought
of
ill
crave
not
too
soon
for
victory
nor
deem
thou
art
a
coward
if
thy
safety
seem
to
spring
too
little
from
a
righteous
will
for
there
is
nightmare
on
thee
nor
until
thy
soul
hath
caught
the
morning
early
gleam
seek
thou
to
analyze
the
monstrous
dream
by
painful
introversion
rather
fill
thine
eye
with
forms
thou
knowest
to
be
truth
but
see
thou
cherish
higher
hope
than
this
hope
hereafter
that
thou
shall
be
fit
to
face
distortion
and
to
sit
transparent
among
other
forms
of
youth
who
own
no
impulse
save
to
god
and
bliss
and
must
i
ever
wake
gray
dawn
to
know
thee
standing
sadly
by
me
like
a
ghost
i
am
perplexed
with
thee
that
thou
shouldst
cost
this
earth
another
turning
all
aglow
thou
shouldst
have
reached
me
with
a
purple
show
along
far
and
i
would
post
over
the
breadth
of
seas
though
i
were
lost
in
the
hot
for
life
if
so
thou
earnest
ever
with
this
numbing
sense
of
chilly
distance
and
unlovely
light
waking
this
gnawing
soul
anew
to
fight
with
its
perpetual
load
i
drive
thee
hence
i
have
another
from
whence
bursteth
a
sun
unutterably
bright
and
yet
it
moves
ah
truth
where
wert
thou
then
when
all
for
thee
they
racked
each
piteous
limb
wert
thou
in
heaven
and
busy
with
thy
hymn
when
those
poor
hands
convulsed
that
held
thy
pen
art
thou
a
phantom
that
deceives
men
to
their
undoing
or
dost
thou
watch
him
pale
cold
and
silent
in
his
dungeon
dim
and
wilt
thou
ever
speak
to
him
again
it
moves
it
moves
alas
my
flesh
was
weak
that
was
a
hideous
dream
i
cry
aloud
how
the
green
bulk
wheels
sunward
day
by
day
ah
me
ah
me
perchance
my
heart
was
proud
that
i
alone
should
know
that
word
to
speak
and
now
sweet
truth
shine
upon
these
i
pray
if
thou
wouldst
live
the
truth
in
very
deed
thou
hast
thy
joy
but
thou
hast
more
of
pain
others
will
live
in
peace
and
thou
be
fain
to
bargain
with
despair
and
in
thy
need
to
make
thy
meal
upon
the
scantiest
weed
these
palaces
for
thee
they
stand
in
vain
thine
is
a
ruinous
hut
and
oft
the
rain
shall
drench
thee
in
the
midnight
yea
the
speed
of
earth
outstrip
thee
pilgrim
while
thy
feet
move
slowly
up
the
heights
yet
will
there
come
through
the
about
thy
moving
cell
from
the
truth
own
bow
and
flaming
sweet
an
arrow
for
despair
and
oft
the
hum
of
populous
realms
where
spirits
dwell
speak
prophet
of
the
lord
we
may
not
start
to
find
thee
with
us
in
thine
ancient
dress
haggard
and
pale
from
some
bleak
wilderness
empty
of
all
save
god
and
thy
loud
heart
nor
with
like
rugged
message
quick
to
dart
into
the
hideous
fiction
mean
and
base
but
yet
o
prophet
man
we
need
not
less
but
more
of
earnest
though
it
is
thy
part
to
deal
in
other
words
if
thou
wouldst
smite
the
living
mammon
seated
not
as
then
in
bestial
quiescence
grimly
dight
but
as
priest
and
honoured
of
good
men
thrice
as
much
an
as
when
he
stared
at
his
own
feet
from
morn
to
night
from
out
a
windy
cleft
there
comes
a
gaze
of
eyes
unearthly
which
go
to
and
fro
upon
the
people
tumult
for
below
the
nations
smite
each
other
no
amaze
troubles
their
liquid
rolling
or
affrays
their
contemplation
steadily
glow
those
ever
holier
eyeballs
for
they
grow
liker
unto
the
eyes
of
one
that
prays
and
if
those
clasped
hands
tremble
comes
a
power
as
of
the
might
of
worlds
and
they
are
holden
blessing
above
us
in
the
sunrise
golden
and
they
will
be
uplifted
till
that
hour
of
terrible
rolling
which
shall
rise
and
shake
this
conscious
nightmare
from
us
and
we
wake
beloved
i
one
do
i
see
and
twelve
but
second
there
methinks
i
know
thee
thou
beloved
one
not
from
thy
nobler
port
for
there
are
none
more
some
there
are
who
bear
their
message
on
their
brows
while
others
wear
a
look
of
large
commission
nor
will
shun
the
fiery
trial
so
their
work
is
done
but
thou
hast
parted
with
thine
eyes
in
prayer
unearthly
are
they
both
and
so
thy
lips
seem
like
the
porches
of
the
spirit
land
for
thou
hast
laid
a
mighty
treasure
by
unlocked
by
him
in
nature
and
thine
eye
burns
with
a
vision
and
apocalypse
thy
own
sweet
soul
can
hardly
understand
ii
a
boanerges
too
upon
my
heart
it
lay
a
heavy
hour
features
like
thine
should
glow
with
other
message
than
the
shine
of
the
levin
and
the
start
that
cleaveth
horrid
gulfs
awful
and
swart
a
moment
stoodest
thou
but
less
divine
brawny
and
clad
in
ruin
till
with
mine
thy
heart
made
answering
signals
and
apart
beamed
forth
thy
two
rapt
eyeballs
doubly
clear
and
twice
as
strong
because
thou
didst
thy
duty
and
though
affianced
to
immortal
beauty
hiddest
not
weakly
underneath
her
veil
the
pest
of
sin
and
death
which
maketh
pale
henceforward
be
thy
spirit
doubly
dear
lily
of
the
there
is
not
any
weed
but
hath
its
shower
there
is
not
any
pool
but
hath
its
star
and
black
and
muddy
though
the
waters
are
we
may
not
miss
the
glory
of
a
flower
and
winter
moons
will
give
them
magic
power
to
spin
in
cylinders
of
diamond
spar
and
everything
hath
beauty
near
and
far
and
keepeth
close
and
waiteth
on
its
hour
and
i
when
i
encounter
on
my
road
a
human
soul
that
looketh
black
and
grim
shall
i
more
ceremonious
be
than
god
shall
i
refuse
to
watch
one
hour
with
him
who
once
beside
our
deepest
woe
did
bud
a
patient
watching
flower
about
the
brim
is
not
the
violent
hands
alone
that
bring
the
curse
the
ravage
and
the
downward
doom
although
to
these
full
oft
the
yawning
tomb
owes
deadly
surfeit
but
a
keener
sting
a
more
immortal
agony
will
cling
to
the
half
fashioned
sin
which
would
assume
fair
virtue
garb
the
eye
that
sows
the
gloom
with
quiet
seeds
of
death
henceforth
to
spring
what
time
the
sun
of
passion
burning
fierce
breaks
through
the
kindly
cloud
of
circumstance
the
bitter
word
and
the
unkindly
glance
the
crust
and
canker
coming
with
the
years
are
liker
death
than
arrows
and
the
lance
which
through
the
living
heart
at
once
doth
pierce
of
several
i
pray
you
all
ye
men
who
put
your
trust
in
moulds
and
systems
and
gear
holding
that
nature
lives
from
year
to
year
in
one
continual
round
because
she
must
set
me
not
down
i
pray
you
in
the
dust
of
all
these
centuries
like
a
pot
of
beer
a
disconsolately
clear
which
holds
a
potful
as
is
right
and
just
i
will
grow
clamorous
by
the
rood
i
will
if
thus
ye
use
me
like
a
pewter
pot
good
friend
thou
art
a
toper
and
a
sot
will
not
be
the
lead
to
hold
thy
swill
nor
any
lead
i
will
arise
and
spill
thy
silly
beverage
spill
it
piping
hot
a
moral
nature
to
him
no
message
dost
thou
bear
who
in
thy
beauty
findeth
not
the
power
to
gird
himself
more
strongly
for
the
hour
of
night
and
darkness
oh
what
colours
rare
the
woods
the
valleys
and
the
mountains
wear
to
him
who
knows
thy
secret
and
in
shower
and
fog
and
hath
a
secret
bower
where
he
may
rest
until
the
heavens
are
fair
not
with
the
rest
of
slumber
but
the
trance
of
onward
movement
steady
and
serene
where
oft
in
struggle
and
in
contest
keen
his
eyes
will
opened
be
and
all
the
dance
of
life
break
on
him
and
a
wide
expanse
roll
upward
through
the
void
sunny
and
green
ah
truant
thou
art
here
again
i
see
for
in
a
season
of
such
wretched
weather
i
thought
that
thou
hadst
left
us
altogether
although
i
could
not
choose
but
fancy
thee
skulking
about
the
whence
the
glee
of
thy
blue
laughter
peeped
at
times
or
rather
thy
bashful
awkwardness
as
doubtful
whether
thou
shouldst
be
seen
in
such
a
company
of
ugly
runaways
unshapely
heaps
of
ruffian
vapour
broken
from
restraint
of
their
slim
prison
in
the
ocean
deeps
but
yet
i
may
not
chide
fall
to
thy
books
fall
to
immediately
without
complaint
there
they
are
lying
hills
and
vales
and
brooks
summer
sweet
summer
summer
we
hold
thee
very
dear
as
well
we
may
it
is
the
kernel
of
the
year
all
hail
to
thee
thou
art
a
welcome
comer
if
every
insect
were
a
fairy
drummer
and
i
a
fifer
that
could
deftly
play
we
give
the
old
earth
such
a
roundelay
that
she
would
cast
all
thought
of
labour
from
ah
what
is
this
upon
my
some
sulky
drooping
cloud
comes
pouting
up
stamping
its
glittering
feet
along
the
plain
well
i
will
let
that
idle
fancy
drop
oh
how
the
spouts
are
bubbling
with
the
rain
and
all
the
earth
shines
like
a
silver
cup
a
whence
do
ye
come
ye
creatures
each
of
you
is
perfect
as
an
angel
wings
and
eyes
stupendous
in
their
beauty
gorgeous
dyes
in
feathery
fields
of
purple
and
of
blue
would
god
i
saw
a
moment
as
ye
do
i
would
become
a
molecule
in
size
rest
with
you
hum
with
you
or
slanting
rise
along
your
one
dear
sunbeam
could
i
view
the
pearly
secret
which
each
tiny
fly
each
tiny
fly
that
hums
and
bobs
and
stirs
hides
in
its
little
breast
eternally
from
you
ye
prickly
grim
philosophers
with
all
your
theories
that
sound
so
high
hark
to
the
buz
a
moment
my
good
sirs
here
stands
a
giant
stone
from
whose
far
top
comes
down
the
sounding
water
let
me
gaze
till
every
sense
of
man
and
human
ways
is
wrecked
and
quenched
for
ever
and
i
drop
into
the
whirl
of
time
and
without
stop
pass
downward
thus
again
my
eyes
i
raise
to
thee
dark
rock
and
through
the
mist
and
haze
my
strength
returns
when
i
behold
thy
prop
gleam
stern
and
steady
through
the
wavering
wrack
surely
thy
strength
is
human
and
like
me
thou
bearest
loads
of
thunder
on
thy
back
and
lo
a
smile
upon
thy
visage
black
a
breezy
tuft
of
grass
which
i
can
see
waving
serenely
from
a
sunlit
crack
above
my
head
the
great
tower
backwards
and
forwards
each
to
the
other
bends
beckoning
the
which
hither
wends
like
a
thought
heavy
with
power
hark
to
the
patter
of
the
coming
shower
let
me
be
silent
while
the
almighty
sends
his
along
but
when
it
ends
i
will
arise
and
fashion
from
the
hour
words
of
stupendous
import
fit
to
guard
high
thoughts
and
purposes
which
i
may
wave
when
the
temptation
cometh
close
and
hard
like
fiery
brands
betwixt
me
and
the
grave
of
meaner
things
to
which
i
am
a
slave
if
evermore
i
keep
not
watch
and
ward
sight
of
the
i
do
remember
how
when
very
young
i
saw
the
great
sea
first
and
heard
its
swell
as
i
drew
nearer
caught
within
the
spell
of
its
vast
size
and
its
mysterious
tongue
how
the
floor
trembled
and
the
dark
boat
swung
with
a
man
in
it
and
a
great
wave
fell
within
a
stone
cast
words
may
never
tell
the
passion
of
the
moment
when
i
flung
all
childish
records
by
and
felt
arise
a
thing
that
died
no
more
an
awful
power
i
claimed
with
trembling
hands
and
eager
eyes
mine
mine
for
ever
an
immortal
the
noise
of
waters
soundeth
to
this
hour
when
i
look
seaward
through
the
quiet
skies
the
source
of
the
thou
the
dash
of
water
loud
and
hoarse
with
its
perpetual
tidings
upward
climb
struggling
against
the
wind
oh
how
sublime
for
not
in
vain
from
its
portentous
source
thy
heart
wild
stream
hath
yearned
for
its
full
force
but
from
thine
caverns
dark
as
time
at
last
thou
issuest
dancing
to
the
rime
of
thy
outvolleying
freedom
lo
thy
course
lies
straight
before
thee
as
the
arrow
flies
right
to
the
away
away
thy
parent
waits
thee
and
her
sunset
dyes
are
ruffled
for
thy
coming
and
the
gray
of
all
her
glittering
borders
flashes
high
against
the
glittering
rocks
oh
haste
and
fly
lie
down
upon
the
ground
thou
hopeless
one
press
thy
face
in
the
grass
and
do
not
speak
dost
feel
the
green
globe
whirl
seven
times
a
week
climbeth
she
out
of
darkness
to
the
sun
which
is
her
god
seven
times
she
doth
not
shun
awful
eclipse
laying
her
patient
cheek
upon
a
pillow
with
shriek
of
voices
utterless
which
rave
and
run
through
all
the
craving
light
and
tidings
of
the
dawn
from
east
and
west
calmly
she
sleepeth
and
her
sleep
is
blest
with
heavenly
visions
and
the
joy
of
night
treading
aloft
with
moons
nor
hath
she
fright
though
cloudy
tempests
beat
upon
her
breast
oft
as
i
rest
in
quiet
peace
am
i
thrust
out
at
sudden
doors
and
madly
driven
through
desert
solitudes
and
black
passages
which
have
not
any
sky
the
scourge
is
on
me
now
with
all
the
cry
of
ancient
life
that
hath
with
murder
striven
how
many
an
anguish
hath
gone
up
to
heaven
how
many
a
hand
in
prayer
been
lifted
high
when
the
black
fate
came
onward
with
the
rush
of
whirlwind
avalanche
or
fiery
spume
even
at
my
feet
is
cleft
a
shivering
tomb
beneath
the
waves
or
else
with
solemn
hush
the
graveyard
opens
and
i
feel
a
crush
as
if
we
were
all
huddled
in
one
doom
comes
there
o
earth
no
breathing
time
for
thee
no
pause
upon
thy
lands
now
resting
on
my
bed
with
listless
hands
i
mourn
thee
resting
not
continually
hear
i
the
plashing
borders
of
the
sea
answer
each
other
from
the
rocks
and
sands
troop
all
the
rivers
seawards
nothing
stands
but
with
strange
noises
hasteth
terribly
hyenas
go
a
moaning
by
howls
to
each
other
all
the
bloody
crew
of
afric
tigers
but
o
men
from
you
comes
this
perpetual
sound
more
loud
and
high
than
aught
that
vexes
air
i
hear
the
cry
of
infant
generations
rising
too
with
i
have
a
fellowship
with
every
shade
of
changing
nature
with
the
tempest
hour
my
soul
goes
forth
to
claim
her
early
dower
of
living
princedom
and
her
wings
have
staid
amidst
the
wildest
uproar
undismayed
yet
she
hath
often
owned
a
better
power
and
blessed
the
gentle
coming
of
the
shower
the
speechless
majesty
of
love
arrayed
in
lowly
virtue
under
which
disguise
full
many
a
princely
thing
hath
passed
her
by
and
she
from
homely
intercourse
of
eyes
hath
gathered
visions
wider
than
the
sky
and
seen
the
withered
heart
of
man
arise
peaceful
as
god
and
full
of
majesty
two
i
one
is
a
slow
and
melancholy
maid
i
know
riot
if
she
cometh
from
the
skies
or
from
the
sleepy
gulfs
but
she
will
rise
often
before
me
in
the
twilight
shade
holding
a
bunch
of
poppies
and
a
blade
of
springing
wheat
prostrate
my
body
lies
before
her
on
the
turf
the
while
she
ties
a
fillet
of
the
weed
about
my
head
and
in
the
gaps
of
sleep
i
seem
to
hear
a
gentle
rustle
like
the
stir
of
corn
and
words
like
odours
thronging
to
my
ear
lie
still
beloved
still
until
the
morn
lie
still
with
me
upon
this
rolling
sphere
still
till
the
judgment
thou
art
faint
and
worn
ii
the
other
meets
me
in
the
public
throng
her
hair
streams
backward
from
her
loose
attire
she
hath
a
trumpet
and
an
eye
of
fire
she
points
me
downward
steadily
and
long
there
is
thy
grave
arise
my
son
be
strong
hands
are
upon
thy
crown
awake
aspire
to
immortality
heed
not
the
lyre
of
the
enchantress
nor
her
but
in
the
stillness
of
the
summer
calm
tremble
for
what
is
godlike
in
thy
being
listen
a
while
and
thou
shall
hear
the
psalm
of
victory
sung
by
creatures
past
thy
seeing
and
from
far
there
comes
the
neighing
of
dreadful
onset
though
the
air
is
balm
iii
maid
with
the
poppies
must
i
let
thee
go
alas
i
may
not
thou
art
likewise
dear
i
am
but
human
and
thou
hast
a
tear
when
she
hath
nought
but
splendour
and
the
glow
of
a
wild
energy
that
mocks
the
flow
of
the
poor
sympathies
which
keep
us
here
lay
past
thy
poppies
and
come
twice
as
near
and
i
will
teach
thee
and
thou
too
shalt
grow
and
thou
shalt
walk
with
me
in
open
day
through
the
rough
thoroughfares
with
quiet
grace
and
the
maid
shall
lead
the
way
timing
her
footsteps
to
a
gentler
pace
as
her
great
orbs
turn
ever
on
thy
face
drinking
in
draughts
of
loving
help
alway
there
is
a
bellowing
in
me
as
of
might
unfleshed
and
visionless
mangling
the
air
with
horrible
convulse
as
if
it
bare
the
cruel
weight
of
worlds
but
could
not
fight
with
the
clods
and
could
but
bite
a
oh
i
will
climb
the
stair
of
the
great
universe
and
lay
me
there
even
at
the
threshold
of
his
gate
despite
the
tempest
and
the
weakness
and
the
rush
of
this
quick
crowding
on
me
oh
i
dream
now
i
am
sailing
swiftly
as
we
seem
to
do
in
sleep
and
i
can
hear
the
gush
of
a
melodious
wave
that
carries
me
on
on
for
ever
to
eternity
cry
out
upon
the
crime
and
then
let
slip
the
dogs
of
hate
whose
hanging
muzzles
track
the
bloody
secret
let
the
welkin
crack
reverberating
while
ye
dance
and
skip
about
the
horrid
blaze
or
else
ye
strip
more
secretly
for
the
avenging
rack
him
who
hath
done
the
deed
till
oozing
black
ye
watch
the
anguish
from
his
nostrils
drip
and
all
the
knotted
limbs
lie
quivering
or
if
your
hearts
disdain
such
banqueting
with
wide
and
tearless
eyes
go
staring
through
the
murder
cells
but
think
that
if
your
knees
bow
not
to
holiness
then
even
in
you
lie
deeper
gulfs
and
blacker
crimes
than
these
aurora
now
have
i
grown
a
sharpness
and
an
edge
unto
my
future
nights
and
i
will
cut
sheer
through
the
ebon
gates
that
yet
will
shut
on
every
set
of
day
or
as
a
sledge
drawn
over
snowy
plains
where
not
a
hedge
breaks
this
aurora
dancing
nothing
but
the
one
cold
esquimaux
unlikely
hut
that
swims
in
the
broad
moonlight
lo
a
wedge
of
the
clean
meteor
hath
been
brightly
driven
right
home
into
the
fastness
of
the
north
anon
it
quickeneth
up
into
the
heaven
and
i
with
it
have
clomb
and
spreaded
forth
upon
the
crisp
and
cooling
atmosphere
my
soul
is
all
abroad
i
can
not
find
it
here
within
each
living
man
there
doth
reside
in
some
unrifled
chamber
of
the
heart
a
hidden
treasure
wayward
as
thou
art
i
love
thee
man
and
bind
thee
to
my
side
by
that
sweet
act
i
purify
my
pride
and
hasten
onward
willing
even
to
part
with
pleasant
graces
though
thy
hue
is
swart
i
bear
thee
company
thou
art
my
guide
even
in
thy
sinning
wise
beyond
thy
ken
to
thee
a
subtle
debt
my
soul
is
owing
i
take
an
impulse
from
the
worst
of
men
that
lends
a
wing
unto
my
onward
going
then
let
me
pay
them
gladly
back
again
with
prayer
and
love
from
faith
and
duty
flowing
on
a
stormy
o
wild
and
dark
a
night
hath
found
me
now
wherein
i
mingle
with
that
element
sent
madly
loose
through
the
wide
staring
rent
in
yon
tormented
branches
i
will
bow
a
while
unto
the
storm
and
thenceforth
grow
into
a
mighty
patience
strongly
bent
before
the
unconquering
power
which
hither
sent
these
winds
to
fight
their
battles
on
my
brow
again
the
loud
boughs
thunder
and
the
din
licks
up
my
footfall
from
the
hissing
earth
but
i
have
found
a
mighty
peace
within
and
i
have
risen
into
a
home
of
mirth
wildly
i
climb
above
the
shaking
spires
above
the
sobbing
clouds
up
through
the
steady
fires
waking
a
power
is
on
me
and
my
soul
must
speak
to
thee
thou
grey
grey
man
whom
i
behold
with
those
children
i
am
bold
to
commune
with
thy
setting
and
to
wreak
my
doubts
on
thy
grey
hair
for
i
would
seek
thee
in
that
other
world
but
i
am
told
thou
goest
elsewhere
and
wilt
never
hold
thy
head
so
high
as
now
oh
i
were
weak
weak
even
to
despair
could
i
forego
the
tender
vision
which
will
give
somehow
thee
standing
brightly
one
day
even
as
now
thou
art
a
very
grey
old
man
and
so
i
may
not
pass
thee
darkly
but
bestow
a
look
of
reverence
on
thy
wrinkled
brow
of
methought
i
stood
among
the
stars
alone
watching
a
grey
parched
orb
which
onward
flew
half
blinded
by
the
dusty
winds
that
blew
empty
as
death
and
barren
as
a
stone
the
pleasant
sound
of
water
all
unknown
when
as
i
looked
in
wonderment
there
grew
high
in
the
air
above
a
drop
of
dew
which
gathering
slowly
through
long
cycles
shone
like
a
great
tear
and
then
at
last
it
fell
clasping
the
orb
which
drank
it
greedily
with
a
delicious
noise
and
upward
swell
of
sweet
cool
joy
that
tossed
me
like
a
sea
and
then
the
thick
life
sprang
as
from
a
grave
with
trees
flowers
boats
upon
the
bounding
wave
a
oh
melancholy
fragment
of
the
night
drawing
thy
lazy
web
against
the
sun
thou
shouldst
have
waited
till
the
day
was
done
with
kindred
glooms
to
build
thy
fane
aright
sublime
amid
the
ruins
of
the
light
but
thus
to
shape
our
glories
one
by
one
with
fearful
hands
ere
we
had
well
begun
to
look
for
shadows
even
in
the
bright
yet
may
we
charm
a
lesson
from
thy
breast
a
secret
wisdom
from
thy
folds
of
thunder
there
is
a
wind
that
cometh
from
the
west
will
rend
thy
tottering
piles
of
gloom
asunder
and
fling
thee
ruinous
along
the
grass
to
sparkle
on
us
as
our
footsteps
pass
and
first
came
the
sun
as
i
did
wake
he
smote
me
on
the
temples
and
i
rose
casting
the
night
aside
and
all
its
woes
and
i
would
spurn
my
idleness
and
take
my
own
wild
journey
even
like
him
and
shake
the
pillars
of
all
doubt
with
lusty
blows
even
like
himself
when
his
rich
glory
goes
right
through
the
stalwart
fogs
that
part
and
break
but
ere
my
soul
was
ready
for
the
fight
his
solemn
setting
mocked
me
in
the
west
and
as
i
trembled
in
the
lifting
night
the
white
moon
met
me
and
my
heart
a
mellow
wisdom
in
her
silent
youth
which
fed
my
hope
with
fear
and
made
my
strength
a
truth
heralding
an
angel
saw
me
sitting
by
a
brook
pleased
with
the
silence
and
the
melodies
of
wind
and
water
which
did
fall
and
rise
he
gently
stirred
his
plumes
and
from
them
shook
an
outworn
doubt
which
fell
on
me
and
took
the
shape
of
darkness
hiding
all
the
skies
blinding
the
sun
but
giving
to
my
eyes
an
inextinguishable
wish
to
look
when
lo
thick
as
the
buds
of
spring
there
came
crowd
upon
crowd
informing
all
the
sky
a
host
of
splendours
watching
silently
with
lustrous
eyes
that
wept
as
if
in
blame
and
waving
hands
that
crossed
in
lines
of
flame
and
signalled
things
i
hope
to
hold
although
i
die
or
death
is
there
a
secret
joy
that
may
not
weep
for
every
flower
that
ends
its
little
span
for
every
child
that
groweth
up
to
man
for
every
captive
bird
a
cage
doth
keep
for
every
aching
eye
that
went
to
sleep
long
ages
back
when
other
eyes
began
to
see
and
know
and
love
as
now
they
can
unravelling
god
wonders
heap
by
heap
or
doth
the
past
lie
eternity
in
charnel
dens
that
rot
and
reek
alway
a
dismal
light
for
those
that
go
astray
a
pit
of
foul
deformity
to
be
beauty
a
dreadful
source
of
growth
for
thee
when
thou
wouldst
lift
thine
eyes
to
greet
the
day
and
i
missed
him
when
the
sun
began
to
bend
i
found
him
not
when
i
had
lost
his
rim
with
many
tears
i
went
in
search
of
him
climbing
high
mountains
which
did
still
ascend
and
gave
me
echoes
when
i
called
my
friend
through
cities
vast
and
grim
and
high
cathedrals
where
the
light
was
dim
through
books
and
arts
and
works
without
an
end
but
found
him
not
the
friend
whom
i
had
lost
and
yet
i
found
him
as
i
found
the
lark
a
sound
in
fields
i
heard
but
could
not
mark
i
found
him
nearest
when
i
missed
him
most
i
found
him
in
my
heart
a
life
in
frost
a
light
i
knew
not
till
my
soul
was
dark
she
comes
again
she
comes
the
moon
under
a
ragged
cloud
i
found
her
out
clasping
her
own
dark
orb
like
hope
in
doubt
that
ragged
cloud
hath
waited
her
since
noon
and
he
hath
found
and
he
will
hide
her
soon
come
all
ye
little
winds
that
sit
without
and
blow
the
shining
leaves
her
edge
about
and
hold
her
fast
ye
have
a
pleasant
tune
she
will
forget
us
in
her
walks
at
night
among
the
other
worlds
that
are
so
fair
she
will
forget
to
look
on
our
despair
she
will
forget
to
be
so
young
and
bright
nay
gentle
moon
thou
hast
the
keys
of
light
i
saw
them
hanging
by
thy
girdle
there
not
form
i
came
upon
a
fountain
on
my
way
when
it
was
hot
and
sat
me
down
to
drink
its
sparkling
stream
when
all
around
the
brink
i
spied
full
many
vessels
made
of
clay
whereon
were
written
not
without
display
in
deep
engraving
or
with
merely
ink
the
blessings
which
each
owner
seemed
to
think
would
light
on
him
who
drank
with
each
alway
i
looked
so
hard
my
eyes
were
looking
double
into
them
all
but
when
i
came
to
see
that
they
were
filthy
each
in
his
degree
i
bent
my
head
though
not
without
some
trouble
to
where
the
little
waves
did
leap
and
bubble
and
so
i
journeyed
on
most
pleasantly
in
i
said
i
will
arise
and
work
some
thing
nor
be
content
with
growth
but
cause
to
grow
a
life
around
me
clear
as
yes
from
no
that
to
my
restless
hand
some
rest
may
bring
and
give
a
vital
power
to
action
spring
thus
i
must
cease
to
be
i
cried
when
lo
an
angel
stood
beside
me
on
the
snow
with
folded
wings
that
came
of
pondering
god
glory
flashes
on
the
silence
here
beneath
the
moon
he
cried
and
upward
threw
his
glorious
eyes
that
swept
the
utmost
blue
ere
yet
his
bounding
brooks
run
forth
with
cheer
to
bear
his
message
to
the
hidden
year
who
cometh
up
in
haste
to
make
his
glory
new
a
there
may
be
seeming
calm
above
but
no
there
is
a
pulse
below
which
ceases
not
a
subterranean
working
fiery
hot
deep
in
the
bosom
though
earthquakes
unlock
not
the
prodigious
show
of
elemental
conflict
and
this
spot
nurses
most
quiet
bones
which
lie
and
rot
and
here
the
humblest
weeds
take
root
and
grow
there
is
a
calm
upon
the
mighty
sea
yet
are
its
depths
alive
and
full
of
being
enormous
bulks
that
move
unwieldily
yet
pore
we
on
it
they
are
past
our
seeing
from
the
deep
fields
though
wide
and
ample
comes
there
no
rushing
sound
do
not
trample
power
that
is
not
of
god
however
great
is
but
the
downward
rushing
and
the
glare
of
a
swift
meteor
that
hath
lost
its
share
in
the
one
impulse
which
doth
animate
the
parent
mass
emblem
to
me
of
fate
which
through
vast
nightly
wastes
doth
onward
fare
and
headlong
rent
away
from
prayer
a
moment
brilliant
then
most
desolate
and
o
my
brothers
shall
we
ever
learn
from
all
the
things
we
see
continually
that
pride
is
but
the
empty
mockery
of
what
is
strong
in
man
not
so
the
stern
and
sweet
repose
of
soul
which
we
can
earn
only
through
reverence
and
humility
yes
there
is
one
who
makes
us
all
lay
down
our
mushroom
vanities
our
speculations
our
theories
and
calculations
our
workman
jacket
or
our
monarch
crown
to
him
alike
the
country
and
the
town
barbaric
hordes
or
civilized
nations

of
all
names
and

the
uplifted

dreamily
among

he
stops
the
helmsman
and
the
gallant
ship
holdeth

westward
by
another
law
no
one
will
see
him
no
one
ever
saw
but
he
sees
all
and
lets
not
any
slip
holy
they
all
were
looking
for
a
king
to
slay
their
foes
and
lift
them
high
thou
a
little
baby
thing
that
made
a
woman
cry
o
son
of
man
to
right
my
lot
nought
but
thy
presence
can
avail
yet
on
the
road
thy
wheels
are
not
nor
on
the
sea
thy
sail
my
fancied
ways
why
shouldst
thou
heed
thou
down
thine
own
secret
stair
down
to
answer
all
my
need
yea
every
bygone
prayer
uplifted
is
the
stone
and
all
mankind
arisen
we
are
thy
very
own
we
are
no
more
in
prison
what
bitterest
grief
can
stay
beside
thy
golden
cup
when
earth
and
life
give
way
and
with
our
lord
we
sup
to
the
marriage
death
doth
call
the
lamps
are
burning
clear
the
virgins
ready
all
have
for
their
oil
no
fear
would
that
even
now
were
ringing
the
distance
with
thy
throng
and
that
the
stars
were
singing
to
us
a
human
song
courage
for
life
is
hasting
to
endless
life
away
the
inward
fire
unwasting
transfigures
our
dull
clay
see
the
stars
melting
sinking
in
we
of
the
splendour
drinking
shall
grow
to
stars
of
light
lost
lost
are
all
our
losses
love
is
for
ever
free
the
full
life
heaves
and
tosses
like
an
unbounded
sea
one
live
eternal
story
one
poem
high
and
broad
and
sun
of
all
our
glory
the
countenance
of
god
man
is
there
of
you
the
homely
words
how
often
read
how
seldom
fully
known
which
father
of
you
asked
for
bread
would
give
his
son
a
stone
how
oft
has
bitter
tear
been
shed
and
heaved
how
many
a
groan
because
thou
wouldst
not
give
for
bread
the
thing
that
was
a
stone
how
oft
the
child
thou
wouldst
have
fed
thy
gift
away
has
thrown
he
prayed
thou
and
the
bread
he
cried
it
is
a
stone
lord
if
i
ask
in
doubt
and
dread
lest
i
be
left
to
moan
am
i
not
he
who
asked
for
bread
would
give
his
son

a

shoal
half

where
no

thy

will
blow
me
to
my

i
kiss
no

than
carry

so
poor

i

thee
father
thou
art
what

art
that
thou
dost
know

what
thou
dost
know
a
perfect
simple
tender
rhythmic
heart
beating
its
blood
to
all
in
bounteous
flow
and
i
can
bless
thee
too
for
every
smart
for
every
disappointment
ache
and
fear
for
every
hook
thou
fixest
in
my
heart
for
every
burning
cord
that
draws
me
near

prayer
these
wake
not
song
thyself
i
crave
come
thou
or
all
thy
gifts
away
i
fling
thou
silent
i
am
but
an
empty
grave
think
to
me
father
and
i
am
a
king
my
will
then
stand
up
awake
their
life
soar
as
from
smouldering
wood
the
blaze
and
swift
contending
harmonies
shall
shake
thy
windows
with
a
storm
of
jubilant
praise
year
sighing
above
rustling
below
thorough
the
woods
the
winds
go
beneath
dead
crowds
above
life
bare
and
the
besom
tempest
sweeps
the
air
leave
thy
woe
let
the
dead
things
through
the
brown
gold
doth
push
misty
green

are
coming

be

through

beech
the
winds
go
with
gentle

lie
in

winter
comes
winter
and
snow
and
a
weary
sighing
to
fall
and
go
thy
hour
shall
be

will
comfort
why
do
the
houses
stand
when
they
that

are
gone
when
remaineth
even
of
one
that
lived
there
and
loved
and
planned
not
a
face
not
an

not
a

only
here
and
there
a
bone
why
do
the
houses
stand
when
they
who
built
them
are
gone
oft
in
the
moonlighted
land
when
the
day
is
overblown
with
happy
memorial
moan
sweet
ghosts
in
a
loving
band
roam
through
the
houses
that
stand
for
the
builders
are
not
gone
where
your
treasure
is
there
will
your
heart
be
the
miser
lay
on
his
lonely
bed
life
candle
was
burning
dim
his
heart
in
an
iron
chest
was
hid
under
heaps
of
gold
and
an
iron
lid
and
whether
it
were
alive
or
dead
it
never
troubled
him
slowly
out
of
his
body
he
crept
he
said
i
am
just
the
same
only
i
want
my
heart
in
my
breast
i
will
go
and
fetch
it
out
of
my
chest
through
the
dark
a
darker
shadow
he
leapt
saying
hell
is
a
fabled
flame
he
opened
the
lid
oh
hell
own
night
his
saw
no
gold
empty
and
swept
not
a
gleam
was
there
in
goes
his
hand
but
the
chest
is
bare
aha
have
only
might
to
close
not
to
clasp
and
hold
but
his
heart
he
saw
and
he
made
a
clutch
at
the
fungous
of
sin
eaten
with
moths
and
fretted
with
rust
he
grasped
a
handful
of
rotten
dust
and
shrieked
as
ghosts
may
at
the
crumbling
touch
but
hid
it
his
breast
within
and
some
there
are
who
see
him
sit
under
the
church
apart
counting
out
coins
and
coins
of
gold
heap
by
heap
on
the
dank
alas
poor
ghost
and
his
sore
lack
of
wit
they
breed
in
the
dust
of
his
heart
another
miser
has
now
his
chest
and
it
hoards
wealth
more
and
more
like
ferrets
his
hands
go
in
and
out
burrowing
tossing
the
gold
about
nor
heed
the
heart
that
gone
from
his
breast
is
the
cold
heap
bloodless
core
now
wherein
differ
old
ghosts
that
sit
counting
all
day
from
the
man
who
clings
with
spirit
prone
to
whatever
can
never
be
his
own
who
will
leave
the
world
with
not
one
whit
but
a
heart
all
eaten
away
asthmatic
man
to
the
satan
that
binds
satan
avaunt
nay
take
thine
hour
thou
canst
not
daunt
thou
hast
no
power
be
welcome
to
thy
nest
though
it
be
in
my
breast
burrow
amain
dig
like
a
mole
fill
every
vein
with
coal
puff
the
keen
dust
about
and
all
to
choke
me
out
fill
music
ways
with
creaking
cries
that
no
loud
praise
may
climb
the
skies
and
on
my
labouring
chest
lay
mountains
of
unrest
my
slumber
steep
in
dreams
of
haste
that
only
sleep
no
rest
i
taste
with
stiflings
rimes
of
rote
and
fingers
on
my
throat
satan
thy
might
i
do
defy
live
core
of
night
i
patient
lie
a
wind
comes
up
the
gray
will
blow
thee
clean
away
christ
angel
death
all
radiant
white
with
one
cold
breath
will
scare
thee
quite
and
give
my
lungs
an
air
as
fresh
as
answered
prayer
so
satan
do
thy
worst
with
me
until
the
true
shall
set
me
free
and
end
what
he
began
by
making
me
a
man
lord
what
is
man
that
thou
art
mindful
of
him
though
in
creation
van
lord
what
is

he
wills
less
than
he
can
lets
his
ideal
scoff
him
lord
what
is
man
that
thou
art
mindful
of
him
all
things
are
shadows
of
thee
lord
the
sun
himself
is
but
thy
shade
my
spirit
is
the
shadow
of
thy
word
a
thing
that
thou
hast
said
diamonds
are
shadows
of
the
sun
they
gleam
as
after
him
they
hark
my
soul
some
arrows
of
thy
light
hath
won
and
feebly
fights
the
dark
all
knowledges
are
broken
shades
in
gulfs
of
dark
a
scattered
horde
together
rush
the
parted
then
lo
thy
garment
lord
my
soul
the
shadow
still
is
light
because
the
shadow
falls
from
thee
i
turn
dull
candle
to
the
centre
bright
and
home
flit
shadowy
shine
lord
shine
me
thy
shadow
still
the
brighter
i
the
more
thy
shade

motion

thy
lovely
moveless
will
my
darkness

delayed
winter
come
through
the
gloom
of
clouded
skies
the
slow
dim
rain
and
fog
athwart
through
east
winds
keen
with
wrong
and
lies
come
and
lift
up
my
hopeless
heart
come
through
the
sickness
and
the
pain
the
sore
unrest
that
tosses
still
through
aching
dark
that
hides
the
gain

and
arouse
my
fainting
will
come
through
the
prate
of
foolish
words
the
science
with
no
god
behind
through
all
the
pangs
of
untuned
chords
speak
wisdom
to
my
shaken
mind
through
all
the
fears
that
spirits
bow
of
what
hath
been
or
may
befall

down
and

with
me
for
thou

tell
me
all
about
them

the

are
spinning
their
threads
and
the
clouds
are
the
dust
that
flies
and
the
suns
are
weaving
them
up
for
the
day
when
the
sleepers
arise
the
ocean
in
music
rolls
the
gems
are
turning
to
eyes
and
the
trees
are
gathering
souls
for
the
day
when
the
sleepers
arise
the
weepers
are
learning
to
smile
and
laughter
to
glean
the
sighs
and
hearts
to
bury
their
care
and
guile
for
the
day
when
the
sleepers
arise
oh
the
dews
and
the
moths
and
the
the
larks
and
the
glimmers
and
flows
the
lilies

and
daily

the
something
that
nobody
knows
child
thy
very
being
who
the
hearts
of
all
us
prodigals
for
who
is
prodigal
but
he
who
has
gone
far
from
the
true
to
heart
it
with
the
false
who
who
but
thou
that
from
the
animals
all
the
hearts
up
to
the
father
own
can
tell
what
it
would
be
to
be
alone
alone
no
father
at
the
very
thought
thou
the
eternal
light
wast
once
aghast
a
death
in
death
for
thee
it
almost
wrought
but
thou
didst
haste
about
to
breathe
thy
last
and
out
ere
thy
spirit
passed
exhausted
in
fulfilling
not
any
vow
but
doing
his
will
who
greater
is
than
thou
that
we
might
know
him
thou
didst
come
and
live
that
we
might
find
him
thou
didst
come
and
die
the
brother
thy
give
we
too
would
love
the
father
perfectly
and
to
his
bosom
go
back
with
the
cry
father
into
thy
hands
i
give
the
heart
which
left
thee
but
to
learn
how
good
thou
art
there
are
but
two
in
all
the
universe
the
father
and
his
children
not
a
third
nor
all
the
weary
time
fell
any
curse
not
once
dropped
from
its
nest
an
unfledged
bird
but
thou
wast
with
it
never
sorrow
stirred
but
a
it
was
upon
the
chain
that
draws
the
children
to
the
father
again
o
jesus
christ
babe
man
eternal
son
take
pity
we
are
poor
where
thou
art
rich
our
hearts
are
small
and
yet
there
is
not
one
in
all
thy
father
noisy
nursery
which
merry
or
mourning
in
its
narrow
niche
needs
not
thy
father
heart
this
very
now
with
all
his
being
being
even
as
thou
i
do
not
know
thy
final
will
it
is
too
good
for
me
to
know
thou
willest
that
i
mercy
show
that
i
take
heed
and
do
no
ill
that
i
the
needy
warm
and
fill
nor
stones
at
any
sinner
throw
but
i
know
not
thy
final
will
it
is
too
good
for
me
to
know
i
know
thy
love
unspeakable
for
love
sake
able
to
send
woe
to
find
thine
own
thou
lost
didst
go
and
wouldst
for
men
thy
blood
yet
spill
how
should
i
know
thy
final
will
godwise
too
good
for
me
to
know
o
lord
i
can
not
but
believe
the
birds
do
sing
thy
praises
then
when
they
sing
to
one
another
and
they
are
lying
land
when
the
winter
makes
them
grieve
their
little
bosoms
breeding
songs
for
the
summer
to
unsmother
if
thou
hadst
finished
me
o
lord
nor
left
out
of
me
part
of
that
great
gift
that
goes
to
singing
i
sure
had
known
the
meaning
high
of
the
songster
praising
word
had
known
upon
what
thoughts
of
thee
his
pearly
talk
he
was
stringing
i
should
have
read
the
wisdom
hid
in
the
melody
of
thy
thrush
bosom
solemn
i
should
not
then
have
understood
what
thy
free
spirit
did
to
make
the
mount
like
to
a
i
think
i
almost
understand
thy
owl
his
muffled
swiftness
eyes
and
intoned
hooting
i
think
i
could
take
up
the
part
of
a
in
the
land
with
yellow
moon
and
starry
things
all
confuting
but
thy
creatures
that
do
sing
perhaps
of
all
i
likest
am
to
the
sparrow
that
flies
brief
sudden
flights
upon
a
dumpy
fluttering
wing
and
chirps
thy
praises
from
a
throat
that
very
short
and
narrow
but
if
thy
sparrow
praise
thee
well
by
singing
well
thy
song
nor
letting
noisy
traffic
quell
it
it
may
be
that
in
some
remote
and
leafy
heavenly
dell
he
may
with
a
awake
and
a
to
swell
it
i
a
thousand
houses
of
poesy
stand
around
me
everywhere
they
fill
the
earth
and
they
fill
my
thought
they
are
in
and
above
the
air
but
they
have
shut
their
doors
they
have
shut
their
shining
windows
fair
and
i
am
left
in
a
desert
world
with
an
aching
as
if
of
care
ii
can
not
i
break
some
little
nut
and
get
at
the
poetry
in
it
can
not
i
break
the
shining
egg
of
some
all
but
hatched
heavenly
linnet
can
not
i
find
some
and
its
moony
spin
it
can
not
i
find
my
all
but
lost
day
in
the
rich
content
of
a
minute
iii
i
will
sit
me
down
all
aching
and
tired
in
the
midst
of
this
of
door
or
window
that
makes
it
look
as
if
truth
herself
were
dozing
i
will
sit
me
down
and
make
me
a
tent
call
it
poetizing
or
prosing
of
what
may
be
lying
within
my
reach
things
at
my
poor
disposing
iv
now
what
is
nearest
my
conscious
self
here
i
sit
quiet
and
say
lo
i
myself
am
already
a
house
of
poetry
solemn
and
gay
but
alas
the
windows
are
shut
all
shut
is
a
cold
and
foggy
day
and
i
have
not
now
the
light
to
see
what
is
in
me
the
same
alway
nay
rather
i
say
i
am
a
nut
in
the
hard
and
frozen
ground
above
is
the
damp
and
frozen
air
the
cold
blue
sky
all
round
and
the
power
of
a
leafy
and
branchy
tree
is
in
me
crushed
and
bound
till
the
summer
come
and
set
it
free
from
the
in
which
it
is
wound
vi
but
i
bethink
me
of
something
better
something
better
yea
best
i
am
lying
a
voiceless
featherless
thing
in
god
own
perfect
nest
and
the
voice
and
the
song
are
growing
within
me
slowly
lifting
my
breast
and
his
wide
are
closed
about
me
for
his
sun
is
down
in
the
west
vii
doors
and
windows
tents
and
winters
and
eggs
and
seeds
ye
shall
all
be
opened
and
broken
and
torn
ye
are
but
to
serve
my
needs
on
the
will
of
the
father
all
lovely
things
are
strung
like
a
string
of
beads
for
his
heart
to
give
the
obedient
child
that
the
will
of
the
father
heeds
after
king
david
i
shall
be
satisfied
with
the
seeing
of
thy
face
when
i
awake
i
shall
be
satisfied
with
what
this
life
did
hide
the
one
supernal
grace
i
shall
be
satisfied
with
the
seeing
of
thy
face
every
time
would
have
its
song
if
the
heart
were
right
seeing
love
all
fills
the
day
and
night
weary
drop
the
hands
of
prayer
calling
out
for
peace
love
always
and
everywhere
sings
and
does
not
cease
fear
the
caitiff
through
the
night
silent
peers
about
love
comes
singing
with
a
light
and
doth
cast
him
out
hate
and
guile
and
wrath
and
doubt
never
try
to
sing
if
they
did
oh
what
a
rout
anguished
ears
would
sting
pride
indeed
will
sometimes
aim
at
the
finer
speech
but
the
best
that
he
can
frame
is
a
greed
will
also
sometimes
try
happiness
he
hunts
but
his
dwelling
is
a
sty
and
his
tones
are
grunts
faith
will
sometimes
raise
a
song
soaring
up
to
heaven
then
she
will
be
silent
long
and
will
weep
at
even
hope
has
many
a
gladsome
note
now
and
then
to
pipe
but
alas
he
has
the
throat
of
a
bird
unripe
often
joy
a
stave
will
start
which
the
welkin
rends
but
it
always
breaks
athwart
and
untimely
ends
grief
who
still
for
death
doth
long
always
has
but
one
low
troubled
song
am
sorry
but
love
singeth
in
the
vault
singeth
on
the
stair
even
for
sorrow
will
not
halt
singeth
everywhere
for
the
great
love
everywhere
over
all
doth
glow
draws
his
birds
up
trough
the
air
tends
his
birds
below
and
with
songs
ascending
sheer
love
replies
singing
in
his
ear
where
she
bleeding
lies
therefore
if
my
heart
were
right
i
should
sing
out
clear
sing
aloud
both
day
and
night
every
month
in
the
year
december
a
dim
vague
shrinking
haunts
my
soul
my
spirit
bodeth
ill
as
some
restraining
bank
had
burst
and
waters
many
a
rank
were
marching
on
my
hill
as
if
i
had
no
fire
within
for
thoughts
to
sit
about
as
if
i
had
no
flax
to
spin
no
lamp
to
lure
the
good
things
in
and
keep
the
bad
things
out
the
wind
raves
in
the
pines
that
guard
my
cottage
round
the
fall
in
stormy
lines
below
the
sandy
cliffs
and
chines
and
swell
the
roaring
sound
the
misty
air
the
bellowing
wind
not
often
trouble
me
the
storm
that
outside
of
the
mind
doth
oftener
wake
my
heart
to
find
more
peace
and
liberty
why
is
not
such
my
fate
chance
is
not
lord
of
things
man
were
indeed
a
hapless
wight
things
thoughts
occurring
as
they
might
chaotic
wallowings
the
man
of
moods
might
merely
say
as
by
the
fire
he
sat
i
am
low
spirited
i
must
do
something
work
or
play
lest
care
should
kill
the
cat
not
such
my
saw
i
was
not
meant
to
be
the
sport
of
things
the
mood
has
meaning
and
intent
and
my
dull
heart
is
humbly
bent
to
have
the
truth
it
brings
this
sense
of
needed
shelter
round
this
frequent
mental
start
show
what
a
poor
life
mine
were
found
to
what
a
dead
self
i
were
bound
how
feeble
were
my
heart
if
i
who
think
did
stand
alone
centre
to
what
i
thought
a
brain
within
a
box
of
bone
a
king
on
a
deserted
throne
a
something
that
was
nought
a
being
without
power
to
be
or
any
power
to
cease
whom
objects
but
compelled
to
see
whose
trouble
was
a
windblown
sea
a
windless
sea
his
peace
this
very
sadness
makes
me
think
how
readily
i
might
be
driven
to
reason
farthest
brink
then
over
it
and
sudden
sink
in
ghastly
waves
of
night
it
makes
me
know
when
i
am
glad
is
thy
strength
makes
me
strong
but
for
thy
bliss
i
should
be
sad
but
for
thy
reason
should
be
mad
but
for
thy
right
be
wrong
around
me
spreads
no
empty
waste
no
lordless
host
of
things
my
restlessness
but
seeks
thy
rest
my
little
good
doth
seek
thy
best
my
needs
thy
ministerings
is
this
this
only
makes
me
safe
i
am
immediate
of
one
that
lives
i
am
no
waif
that
haggard
waters
toss
and
chafe
but
of
a
royal
fate
the
of
a
power
that
lives
because
it
will
and
can
a
love
whose
slightest
motion
gives
a
freedom
that
forever
strives
to
liberate
his
man
i
live
not
on
the
circling
air
live
not
by
daily
food
i
live
not
even
by
thinkings
fair
i
hold
my
very
being
there
where
god
is
pondering
good
because
god
lives
i
live
because
he
thinks
i
also
think
i
am
dependent
on
no
laws
but
on
himself
and
without
pause
between
us
hangs
no
link
the
man
that
lives
he
knows
not
how
may
well
fear
any
mouse
i
should
be
trembling
this
same
now
if
i
did
think
my
father
thou
wast
nowhere
in
the
house
o
father
lift
me
on
thine
arm
and
hold
me
close
to
thee
lift
me
into
thy
breathing
warm
then
cast
me
and
i
fear
no
harm
into
creation
sea
in
his
arms
thy
silly
lamb
lo
he
gathers
to
his
breast
see
thou
sadly
bleating
dam
see
him
lift
thy
silly
lamb
hear
it
cry
how
blest
i
am
here
is
love
and
love
is
rest
in
his
arms
thy
silly
lamb
see
him
gather
to
his
breast
donkey
in
the
cart
to
the
horse
in
the
i
say
hey
cousin
there
i
must
call
you
brother
yet
you
have
a
tail
behind
and
i
have
another
you
pull
and
i
pull
though
we
do
pull
together
you
have
less
hardship
and
i
have
more
weather
ii
your
legs
are
long
mine
are
short
i
am
lean
you
are
fatter
your
step
is
bold
and
free
mine
goes
your
head
is
in
the
air
and
mine
hangs
down
like
lead
but
then
my
two
great
ears
are
so
heavy
on
my
head
iii
you
need
not
whisk
your
stump
nor
turn
away
your
nose
poor
donkeys
ai
so
stupid
as
rich
horses
may
suppose
i
could
feed
in
any
manger
just
as
well
as
you
though
i
do
despise
a
thistle
with
sauce
of
dust
and
dew
iv
day
a
bishop
cob
stopped
before
me
in
a
lane
with
a
tail
as
broad
as
and
a
hoggy
mane
i
stood
sideways
to
the
hedge
but
he
did
not
want
to
pass
and
he
was
so
full
of
corn
he
did
care
about
the
grass
quoth
the
cob
you
are
a
donkey
of
a
most
peculiar
breed
you
just
eaten
up
a
thistle
that
was
going
fast
to
seed
if
you
had
but
let
it
be
you
might
have
raised
a
crop
to
many
a
coming
dinner
you
have
put
a
sad
stop
vi
i
told
him
i
was
hungry
and
to
leave
one
of
ten
would
have
spoiled
my
best
dinner
the
one
i
wanted
then
said
the
cob
ought
to
know
the
truth
about
dinners
do
eat
on
roadsides
like
poor
tramping
sinners
vii
why
do
you
take
it
easy
you
are
working
much
too
hard
in
the
shafts
you
die
one
day
if
you
not
upon
your
guard
have
pity
on
your
friends
work
seems
to
you
delectable
but
believe
me
such
a
cart
excuse
me
not
respectable
viii
i
told
him
i
must
trot
in
the
shafts
where
i
was
put
nor
look
round
at
the
cart
but
set
foremost
my
best
foot
it
rather
rickety
and
the
axle
wanted
oil
but
i
always
slept
at
night
with
the
deep
sleep
of
toil
ix
all
very
fine
he
said
to
wag
your
ears
and
parley
and
pretend
you
quite
despise
my
bellyfuls
of
barley
but
with
blows
and
with
starving
and
with
labour
by
spurs
a
week
will
see
you
in
the
knacker
yard
i
thanked
him
for
his
counsel
and
said
i
thought
i
take
it
really
if
he
spare
me
half
a
feed
out
of
four
feeds
daily
he
tossed
his
head
at
that
now
do
be
cheeky
said
he
when
i
find
i
getting
fat
i
think
of
you
keep
steady
xi
i
said
and
say
for
you
are
such
another
why
now
i
look
at
you
i
see
you
are
his
brother
yes
thank
you
for
your
kick
was
all
that
you
could
spare
for
sure
they
clip
and
singe
you
very
very
bare
xii
my
cart
it
is
upsets
you
but
in
that
cart
behind
there
no
dirt
or
rubbish
no
bags
of
gold
or
wind
there
potatoes
there
and
wine
and
corn
and
and
a
good
can
of
milk
and
some
honey
too
indeed
xiii
few
blows
i
get
some
hay
and
of
water
many
a
draught
i
tell
you
he
no
coster
that
sits
upon
my
shaft
and
for
the
knacker
yard
that
not
my
destined
bed
no
donkey
ever
yet
saw
himself
there
lying
dead
to
strait
is
the
path
he
means
we
must
not
roam
yes
but
the
strait
path
leads
into
a
boundless
home
by
the
cradle
close
her
eyes
she
must
not
peep
let
her
little
puds
go
slack
slide
away
far
into
sleep
sis
will
watch
till
she
comes
back
mother
knitting
at
the
door
waiting
till
the
kettle
sings
when
the
kettle
song
is
she
will
set
the
bright
father
busy
making
hay
in
the
meadow
by
the
brook
not
so
very
far
away
close
its
peeps

need
look

is
round
us
everywhere

the
scythe

and

outright

sitting
just
behind

only
out
of

round
us

and
sweep
and
sweep

that
god
goes
sweeping
looking
sweeping
with
a
broom
all
the
time
that
we
are
sleeping
for
a
shilling
in
the
room
did
he
drop
it
out
of
glory
walking
far
above
the
birds
or
did
parson
make
the
story
for
the
thinking
afterwards
if
i
were
the
shilling
i
would
hearken
through
the
gloom
roll
out
fast
and
fall
down
willing
right
before
the
sweeping
broom
washing
the
clothes
this
is
the
way
we
wash
the
free
from
dirt
and
smoke
and
clay
through
and
through
the
water
flows
carries
ugly
right
away
this
is
the
way
we
bleach
the
lay
them
out
upon
the
green
through
and
through
the
sunshine
goes
makes
them
white
as
well
as
clean
this
is
the
way
we
dry
the
hang
them
on
the
bushes
about

and
through
the
soft
wind

and
drives
the
wetness

the
clothes
clean
white
and

them
now
in
lavender

it
from
the
precious
pool
up
it

all
brown
and

twilight

as
it
rises
to
the
brim

the
friends
each
other

back
alive
with
fun

you
not
a
tale
to
tell

as
i
take
you
home
tell
me
of
the
hidden
well
whence
you
first
of
all
did
come
of
it
you
have
kept
some
flavour
through
long
paths
of
darkling
strife
water
all
has
still
a
savour
of
the
primal
well
of
life
could
you
show
the
lovely
way
back
and
up
through
sea
and
sky
to
that
well
oh
happy
day
i
would
drink
and
never
die
jesus
sits
there
on
its
brink
all
the
world
great
thirst
to
slake
offering
every
one
to
drink
who
will
only
come
and
take
lord
of
wells
and
waters
all
lord
of
rains
and
dewy
beads
unto
thee
my
thirst
doth
call
for
the
thing

and

in
mine
straight
from
his
heart
cleaning
the
windows
wash
the
window
rub
it
dry
make
the
clean
and
bright
he
who
lords
it
in
the
sky
loves
on
cottage
floors
to
light
looking
over
sea
and
beck
he
can
spy
the
smallest
speck
anywhere
about
the
room
see
how
bright
his
torch
is
blazing
in
the
heart
of
mother
store
strange
i
never
saw
him
gazing
so
into
that
press
before
ah
i
see
the
wooden
pane
in
the
window
dull
and
dead
father
called
its
loss
a
gain
and
a
glass
one
put
instead
what
a
difference
it
makes
how
it
melts
the
filmy
gloom
what
a
little
more
it
takes
much
to
brighten
up
a
room
there
i
spy
a
dusty
streak
there
a
corner
not
quite
clean
there
a
cobweb
there
the
sneak
of
a
spider
watching
keen
lord
of
suns
and
eyes
that
see
shine
into
me
see
and
show
leave
no
darksome
spot
in
me
where
thou
dost
not
shining
go
fill
my
spirit
full
of
eyes
doors
of
light
in
every
part
open
windows
to
the
skies
that
no
moth
corrupt
my
heart
wind
and
the
said
the
wind
to
the
moon
i
will
blow
you
out
you
stare
in
the
air
as
if
crying
always
looking
what
i
am
about
i
hate
to
be
watched
i
will
blow
you
out
the
wind
blew
hard
and
out
went
the
moon
so
deep
on
a
heap
of
clouds
to
sleep
down
lay
the
wind
and
slumbered
soon
muttering
low
i
done
for
that
moon
he
turned
in
his
bed
she
was
there
again
on
high
in
the
sky
with
her
one
the
moon
shone
white
and
alive
and
plain
said
the
wind
i
will
blow
you
out
again
the
wind
blew
hard
and
the
moon
grew
slim
with
my
sledge
and
my
wedge
i
have
knocked
off
her
edge
i
will
blow
said
the
wind
right
fierce
and
grim
and
the
creature
will
soon
be
slimmer
than
slim
he
blew
and
he
blew
and
she
thinned
to
a
thread
one
puff
more
enough
to
blow
her
to
snuff
one
good
puff
more
where
the
last
was
bred
and
glimmer
glimmer
glum
will
go
that
thread
he
blew
a
great
blast
and
the
thread
was
gone
in
the
air
nowhere
was
a
moonbeam
bare
larger
and
nearer
the
shy
stars
shone
sure
and
certain
the
moon
was
gone
the
wind
he
took
to
his
revels
once
more
on
down
and
in
town
a
clown
he
leaped
and
holloed
with
whistle
and
roar
when
there
was
that
glimmering
thread
once
more
he
flew
in
a
rage
he
danced
and
blew
but
in
vain
was
the
pain
of
his
bursting
brain
for
still
the
the
broader
grew
the
more
that
he
swelled
his
big
cheeks
and
blew
slowly
she
grew
till
she
filled
the
night
and
shone
on
her
throne
in
the
sky
alone
a
matchless
wonderful
silvery
light
radiant
and
lovely
the
queen
of
the
night
said
the
wind
what
a
marvel
of
power
am
i
with
my
breath
in
good
faith
i
blew
her
to
death
first
blew
her
away
right
out
of
the
sky
then
blew
her
in
what
a
strength
am
i
but
the
moon
she
knew
nought
of
the
silly
affair
for
high
in
the
sky
with
her
one
white
eye
motionless
miles
above
the
air
she
never
had
heard
the
great
wind
blare
foolish
a
harebell
hung
her
wilful
head
i
am
tired
so
tired
i
wish
i
was
dead
she
hung
her
head
in
the
mossy
dell
if
all
were
over
then
all
were
well
the
wind
he
heard
and
was
pitiful
and
waved
her
about
to
make
her
cool
wind
you
are
rough
said
the
dainty
bell
leave
me
alone
i
am
not
well
the
wind
at
the
word
of
the
drooping
dame
sighed
to
himself
and
ceased
in
shame
i
am
hot
so
hot
she
moaned
and
said
i
am
withering
up
i
wish
i
was
dead
then
the
sun
he
pitied
her
woeful
case
and
drew
a
thick
veil
over
his
face
cloud
go
away
and
do
be
rude
she
said
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
the
cloud
withdrew
then
the
harebell
cried
i
am
faint
so
faint
and
no
water
beside
the
dew
came
down
its
millionfold
path
she
murmured
i
did
not
want
a
bath
the
dew
went
up
the
wind
softly
crept
the
night
came
down
and
the
harebell
slept
a
boy
ran
past
in
the
morning
gray
plucked
the
harebell
and
threw
her
away
the
harebell
shivered
and
sighed
oh
oh
i
am
faint
indeed
come
dear
wind
blow
the
wind
blew
gently
and
did
not
speak
she
thanked
him
kindly
but
grew
more
weak
sun
dear
sun
i
am
cold
she
said
he
shone
but
lower
she
drooped
her
head
o
rain
i
am
withering
all
the
blue
is
fading
out
of
me
come
please
do
the
rain
came
down
as
fast
as
he
could
but
for
all
his
good
will
he
could
do
her
no
good
she
shuddered
and
shrivelled
and
moaning
said
thank
you
all
kindly
and
then
she
was
dead
let
us
hope
let
us
hope
when
she
comes
next
year
she
be
simple
and
sweet
but
i
fear
i
fear
i
was
very
cold
in
the
summer
weather
the
sun
shone
all
his
gold
but
i
was
very
cold
alas
we
were
grown
old
love
and
i
together
oh
but
i
was
cold
in
the
summer
weather
sudden
i
grew
warmer
though
the
brooks
were
frozen
truly
scorn
did
harm
her
i
said
and
i
grew
warmer
better
men
the
charmer
knows
at
least
a
dozen
i
said
and
i
grew
warmer
though
the
brooks
were
frozen
spring
sits
on
her
nest
daisies
and
white
clover
and
my
heart
at
rest
lies
in
the
spring
young
nest
my
love
she
loves
me
best
and
the
frost
is
over
spring
sits
on
her
nest
daisies
and
white
clover
the
stars
cleave
the
sky
yet
for
us
they
rest
and
their
high
is
a
shining
nest
the
hours
hurry
on
but
where
is
thy
flight
soft
pavilion
of
motionless
night
earth
gives
up
her
trees
to
the
holy
air
they
live
in
the
breeze
they
are
saints
at
prayer
summer
night
come
from
god
on
your
beauty
i
see
a
still
wave
has
flowed
of
eternity
no
bird
can
sing
in
tune
but
that
the
lord
sits
throned
in
equity
above
the
heaven
and
holds
the
righteous
balance
always
even
no
heart
can
true
response
to
love
afford
wherein
from
one
to
eight
not
every
chord
is
yet
attuned
by
the
spirits
seven
for
tuneful
no
bird
sings
but
that
the
lord
is
throned
in
equity
above
high
heaven
oh
heart
by
wrong
unfilial
scathed
and
scored
and
from
thy
humble
throne
with
mazedness
driven
take
courage
when
thy
wrongs
thou
hast
forgiven
thy
rights
in
love
thy
god
will
see
restored
no
bird
could
sing
in
tune
but
that
the
lord
sits
throned
in
equity
above
the
heaven
out
of
the
gulf
into
the
glory
father
my
soul
cries
out
to
be
lifted
dark
is
the
woof
of
my
dismal
story
thorough
thy
stormily
drifted
out
of
the
gulf
into
the
glory
lift
me
and
save
my
story
i
have
done
many
things
merely
shameful
i
am
a
man
ashamed
my
father
my
life
is
ashamed
and
broken
and
blameful
the
broken
and
blameful
oh
cleanse
and
gather
heartily
shame
me
lord
of
the
shameful
to
my
judge
i
flee
with
my
blameful
saviour
at
peace
in
thy
perfect
purity
think
what
it
is
not
to
be
pure
strong
in
thy
love
essential
security
think
upon
those
who
are
never
secure
full
fill
my
soul
with
the
light
of
thy
purity
fold
me
in
love
security
o
father
o
brother
my
heart
is
sore
aching
help
it
to
ache
as
much
as
is
needful
is
it
you
cleansing
me
mending
remaking
dear
so
tender
and
heedful
sick
of
my
past
of
my
own
self
aching
hurt
on
dear
hands
with
your
making
proud
of
the
form
thou
hadst
given
thy
vessel
proud
of
myself
i
forgot
my
donor
down
in
the
dust
i
began
to
nestle
poured
thee
no
wine
and
drank
deep
of
dishonour
lord
thou
hast
broken
thou
mendest
thy
vessel
in
the
dust
of
thy
glory
i
nestle
on
an
engraving
of
scheffer
i
what
human
form
is
this
what
form
divine
and
who
are
these
that
gaze
upon
his
face
mild
beautiful
and
full
of
heavenly
grace
with
whose
reflected
light
the
gazers
shine
saviour
who
does
not
know
it
to
be
thine
who
does
not
long
to
fill
a
gazer
place
and
yet
there
is
no
time
there
is
no
space
to
keep
away
thy
servants
from
thy
shrine
here
if
we
kneel
and
watch
with
faithful
eyes
thou
art
not
too
far
for
faithful
eyes
to
see
thou
art
not
too
far
to
turn
and
look
on
me
to
speak
to
me
and
to
receive
my
sighs
therefore
for
ever
i
forget
the
skies
and
find
an
everlasting
sun
in
thee
ii
oh
let
us
never
leave
that
happy
throng
from
that
low
attitude
of
love
not
cease
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
other
peace
in
all
the
world
no
other
shield
from
wrong
but
chiefly
saviour
for
thy
feet
we
long
for
no
vain
quiet
for
no
pride
increase
but
that
being
weak
and
thou
divinely
strong
us
from
our
hateful
selves
thou
mayst
release
we
wander
from
thy
fold
free
holy
air
forget
thy
looks
and
take
our
fill
of
sin
but
if
thou
keep
us
evermore
within
we
never
surely
can
forget
thee
there
breathing
thy
breath
thy
white
robe
given
to
wear
and
loving
thee
for
all
thou
diedst
to
win
iii
to
speak
of
him
in
language
of
our
own
is
not
for
us
too
daringly
to
try
but
saviour
we
can
read
thy
history
upon
the
faces
round
thy
humble
throne
and
as
the
flower
among
the
grass
makes
known
what
summer
suns
have
warmed
it
from
the
sky
as
every
human
smile
and
human
sigh
is
witness
that
we
do
not
live
alone
so
in
that
company
in
those
sweet
tears
the
of
a
rugged
melted
heart
in
those
gaunt
chains
for
ever
torn
apart
and
in
the
words
that
weeping
mother
hears
we
read
the
story
of
two
thousand
years
and
know
thee
somewhat
saviour
as
thou
art
i
can
not
write
old
verses
here
dead
things
a
thousand
years
away
when
all
the
life
of
the
young
year
is
in
the
summer
day
the
roses
make
the
world
so
sweet
the
bees
the
birds
have
such
a
tune
there
such
a
light
and
such
a
heat
and
such
a
joy
this
june
one
must
expand
one
heart
with
praise
and
make
the
memory
secure
of
sunshine
and
the
woodland
days
and
summer
twilights
pure
oh
listen
rather
nature
song
comes
from
the
waters
beating
tides
rivers
and
the
throng
of
streams
on
so
fair
those
are
such
happy
strength
their
music
fills
our
joy
shall
be
to
wander
far
and
find
them
on
the
hills
a
a
fresh
young
voice
that
sings
to
me
so
often
many
a
simple
thing
should
surely
not
unanswered
be
by
all
that
i
can
sing
dear
voice
be
happy
every
way
a
thousand
changing
tones
among
from
little
child
unfinished
lay
to
angel
perfect
song
in
dewy
woods
fair
soft
and
green
like
morning
woods
are
childhood
bower
be
like
the
voice
of
brook
unseen
among
the
stones
and
flowers
a
joyful
voice
though
born
so
low
and
making
all
its
neighbours
glad
sweet
hidden
constant
in
its
flow
even
when
the
winds
are
sad
so
strengthen
in
a
peaceful
home
and
daily
deeper
meanings
bear
and
when
life
wildernesses
come
be
brave
and
faithful
there
try
all
the
glorious
magic
range
worship
forgive
console
rejoice
until
the
last
and
