apology
in
these
rushful
days
an
apology
is
advisable
if
not
absolutely
essential
from
any
man
save
the
one
or
two
elect
who
has
the
temerity
to
publish
a
volume
of
verse
these
stray
lines
such
as
they
are
have
come
to
me
from
time
to
time
i
hardly
know
how
or
whence
certainly
not
of
deliberate
intention
or
of
malice
aforethought
more
often
than
not
they
have
come
to
the
interruption
of
other
as
it
seemed
to
me
more
important
and
undoubtedly
more
profitable
work
they
are
for
the
most
part
simply
attempts
at
concrete
and
rememberable
expression
of
ideas
ages
old
most
of
them
which
asked
for
more
most
writers
i
imagine
find
themselves
at
times
in
that
same
predicament
worried
by
some
thought
which
dances
within
them
and
stubbornly
refuses
to
be
satisfied
with
the
sober
dress
of
prose
for
their
own
satisfaction
and
relief
in
such
a
case
if
they
be
not
fools
they
endeavour
to
garb
it
more
to
its
liking
and
so
find
peace
or
to
vary
the
metaphor
they
pluck
the
bee
out
of
their
bonnet
and
pop
it
into
such
amber
as
they
happen
to
have
about
them
or
are
able
to
evolve
and
so
put
an
end
to
its
buzzing
in
their
previous
states
these
little
of
mine
have
apparently
given
pleasure
to
quite
a
number
of
intelligent
and
thoughtful
folk
and
now
chiefly
i
am
bound
to
say
for
my
own
satisfaction
in
seeing
them
all
together
i
have
gathered
them
into
one
bunch
if
they
please
you
good
if
not
there
is
no
harm
done
and
one
man
is
content
john
oxenham
credo
not
what
but
whom
i
do
believe
that
in
my
darkest
hour
of
need
hath
comfort
that
no
mortal
creed
to
mortal
man
may
give
not
what
but
whom
for
christ
is
more
than
all
the
creeds
and
his
full
life
of
gentle
deeds
shall
all
the
creeds
outlive
not
what
i
do
believe
but
whom
who
walks
beside
me
in
the
gloom
who
shares
the
burden
wearisome
who
all
the
dim
way
doth
illume
and
bids
me
look
beyond
the
tomb
the
larger
life
to
live
not
what
i
do
believe
but
whom
not
what
but
whom
new
year
day
and
every
day
man
is
captain
of
his
soul
and
each
man
his
own
crew
but
the
pilot
knows
the
unknown
seas
and
he
will
bring
us
we
break
new
seas
our
eager
keels
quest
unaccustomed
waters
and
from
the
vast
uncharted
waste
in
front
the
mystic
circles
leap
to
greet
our
prows
with
mightiest
possibilities
bringing
us
what
dread
shoals
and
shifting
banks
and
calms
and
storms
and
clouds
and
biting
gales
and
wreck
and
loss
and
valiant
and
maybe
death
and
so
the
larger
life
should
the
pilot
deem
it
best
to
cut
the
voyage
short
he
sees
beyond
the
and
he
bring
us
into
and
maybe
life
life
on
a
bounding
tide
and
chance
of
glorious
deeds
of
help
to
drowning
mariners
of
cheer
to
ships
dismasted
in
the
gale
of
succours
given
unasked
and
joyfully
of
mighty
service
to
all
needy
souls
ho
for
the
pilot
orders
whatever
course
he
makes
for
he
sees
beyond
the
and
he
never
makes
and
maybe
golden
days
full
freighted
with
delight
and
wide
free
seas
of
unimagined
bliss
and
treasure
isles
and
kingdoms
to
be
won
and
undiscovered
countries
and
new
kin
each
man
captains
his
own
soul
and
chooses
his
own
crew
but
the
pilot
knows
the
unknown
seas
and
he
will
bring
us
philosopher
garden
this
my
garden
large
and
thus
to
his
friend
the
philosopher
not
too
his
friend
replied
with
truth
exact
yet
too
wide
but
well
compact
if
somewhat
cramped
on
every
quick
the
reply
see
how
high
it
reaches
up
to
god
blue
not
by
their
size
measure
we
men
or
things
wisdom
with
eyes
washed
in
the
fire
seeketh
the
things
that
are
higher
things
that
have
wings
thoughts
that
aspire
flowers
of
the
dust
the
mills
of
god
grind
slowly
but
they
grind
exceeding
small
so
soft
and
slow
the
great
wheels
go
they
scarcely
move
at
all
but
the
souls
of
men
fall
into
them
and
are
powdered
into
dust
and
in
that
dust
grow
the
love
hope
trust
most
wondrous
their
upspringing
in
the
dust
of
the
and
rare
beyond
the
telling
the
fragrance
each
distils
some
grow
up
tall
and
stately
and
some
grow
sweet
and
small
but
life
out
of
death
is
in
each
one
with
purpose
grow
they
all
for
that
dust
is
god
own
garden
and
the
lord
christ
tends
it
fair
with
oh
such
loving
tenderness
and
oh
such
patient
care
in
sorrow
the
seeds
are
planted
they
are
watered
with
bitter
tears
but
their
roots
strike
down
to
the
and
the
sources
of
the
years
these
flowers
of
christ
own
providence
they
wither
not
nor
die
but
flourish
fair
and
fairer
still
through
all
eternity
in
the
dust
of
the
mills
and
in
travail
the
amaranth
seeds
are
sown
but
the
flowers
in
their
full
beauty
climb
the
pillars
of
the
throne
the
first
line
only
is
adapted
from
the
sinngedichte
of

logau
the
pilgrim
way
but
once
i
pass
this
way
and
then
no
more
but
once
and
then
the
silent
door
swings
on
its
hinges
opens
closes
and
no
more
i
pass
this
way
so
while
i
may
with
all
my
might
i
will
essay
sweet
comfort
and
delight
to
all
i
meet
upon
the
pilgrim
way
for
no
man
travels
twice
the
great
highway
that
climbs
through
darkness
up
to
light
through
night
to
day
everymaid
king
daughter
wouldst
thou
be
all
fair
without
within
peerless
and
beautiful
a
very
queen
know
then
not
as
men
build
unto
the
silent
one
with
clang
and
clamour
traffic
of
rude
voices
clink
of
steel
on
stone
and
din
of
hammer
not
so
the
temple
of
thy
grace
is
reared
but
in
the
inmost
shrine
must
thou
begin
and
build
with
care
a
holy
place
a
place
unseen
each
stone
a
prayer
then
having
built
thy
shrine
sweep
bare
of
self
and
sin
and
all
that
might
demean
and
with
endeavour
watching
ever
praying
ever
keep
it
and
clean
so
by
god
grace
it
be
fit
place
his
christ
shall
enter
and
shall
dwell
therein
not
as
in
earthly
fane
where
chase
of
steel
on
stone
may
strive
to
win
some
outward
grace
temple
face
is
chiselled
from
better
and
best
better
in
bitterest
agony
to
lie
before
thy
throne
than
through
much
increase
to
be
lifted
up
on
high
and
stand
alone
better
by
one
sweet
soul
constant
and
true
to
be
beloved
than
all
the
kingdoms
of
delight
to
trample
through
unloved
unloved
yet
best
the
need
that
broke
me
at
thy
feet
in
voiceless
prayer
and
cast
my
chastened
heart
a
sacrifice
complete
upon
thy
care
for
all
the
world
is
nought
and
less
than
nought
compared
with
this
that
my
dear
lord
with
his
own
life
my
ransom
bought
and
i
am
his
the
shadow
shapeless
and
grim
a
shadow
dim
the
ways
and
darkened
all
my
days
and
all
who
saw
with
bated
breath
said
it
is
death
and
i
in
weakness
slipping
towards
the
night
in
sore
affright
looked
up
and
lo
no
spectre
grim
but
just
a
dim
sweet
face
a
sweet
high
a
face
like
christ
own
mother
face
alight
with
tenderness
and
grace
thou
art
not
death
i
cried
for
life
supremest
fantasy
had
never
thus
envisaged
death
to
me
thou
art
not
death
the
end
in
accents
winning
came
the
answer
there
is
no
death
i
am
the
beginning
not
the
the
potter
a
potter
playing
with
his
lump
of
clay
fashioned
an
image
of
supremest
worth
was
nobler
image
made
on
earth
than
this
that
i
have
fashioned
of
my
clay
and
i
of
mine
own
skill
did
fashion
it
i
from
this
lump
of
the
master
looking
out
on
pots
and
men
heard
his
vain
boasting
smiled
at
that
he
said
clay
is
mine
and
i
the
potter
made
as
i
made
all
things
stars
and
clay
and
men
in
what
doth
this
man
overpass
the
rest
be
thou
as
other
he
touched
the
image
and
it
fell
to
dust
he
touched
the
potter
he
to
dust
did
fall
gently
the
master
did
make
them
all
all
things
and
men
heaven
glories
and
the
dust
who
with
me
works
shall
quicken
death
itself
without
me
dust
is
nightfall
fold
up
the
tent
the
sun
is
in
the
west
my
untented
soul
will
range
among
the
blest
and
i
am
well
content
for
what
is
sent
is
sent
and
god
knows
best
fold
up
the
tent
and
speed
the
parting
guest
the
night
draws
on
though
night
and
day
are
one
on
this
long
quest
this
house
was
only
lent
for
my
apprenticement
what
is
is
best
fold
up
the
tent
its
slack
ropes
all
undone
its
pole
all
broken
and
its
cover
rent
its
work
is
done
but
mine
tho
spoiled
and
spent
mine
earthly
tenement
is
but
begun
fold
up
the
tent
its
tenant
would
be
gone
to
fairer
skies
than
mortal
eyes
may
look
upon
all
that
i
loved
has
passed
and
left
me
at
the
last
alone
alone
fold
up
the
tent
above
the
mountain
crest
i
hear
a
clear
voice
calling
calling
clear
to
rest
to
rest
and
i
am
glad
to
go
for
the
sweet
oil
is
low
and
rest
is
best
the
pruner
god
is
a
zealous
pruner
for
he
knows
who
falsely
tender
spares
the
knife
but
spoils
the
rose
the
ways
to
every
man
there
openeth
a
way
and
ways
and
a
way
and
the
high
soul
climbs
the
high
way
and
the
low
soul
gropes
the
low
and
in
between
on
the
misty
flats
the
rest
drift
to
and
fro
but
to
every
man
there
openeth
a
high
way
and
a
low
and
every
man
decideth
the
way
his
soul
shall
go
seeds
what
shall
we
be
like
when
we
cast
this
earthly
body
and
attain
to
immortality
what
shall
we
be
like
then
ah
who
shall
say
what
vast
expansions
shall
be
ours
that
day
what
transformations
of
this
house
of
clay
to
fit
the
heavenly
mansions
and
the
light
of
day
ah
who
shall
say
but
this
we
know
we
drop
a
seed
into
the
ground
a
tiny
shapeless
thing
shrivelled
and
dry
and
in
the
fulness
of
its
time
is
seen
a
form
of
peerless
beauty
robed
and
crowned
beyond
the
pride
of
any
earthly
queen
instinct
with
loveliness
and
sweet
and
rare
the
perfect
emblem
of
its
maker
care
this
from
a
shrivelled
seed
then
may
man
hope
indeed
for
man
is
but
the
seed
of
what
he
shall
be
when
in
the
fulness
of
his
perfecting
he
drops
the
husk
and
cleaves
his
upward
way
through
earth
retardings
and
the
clinging
clay
into
the
sunshine
of
god
perfect
day
no
fetters
then
no
bonds
of
time
or
space
but
powers
as
ample
as
the
boundless
grace
that
suffered
man
and
death
and
yet
in
tenderness
set
wide
the
door
and
passed
himself
before
as
he
had
promised
to
prepare
a
place
yea
we
may
hope
for
we
are
seeds
dropped
into
earth
for
heavenly
blossoming
perchance
when
comes
the
time
of
harvesting
his
loving
care
may
find
some
use
for
even
a
humble
tare
we
know
not
what
we
shall
be
only
this
that
we
shall
be
made
like
him
as
he
is
whirring
wheels
lord
when
on
my
bed
i
lie
sleepless
unto
thee
i
cry
when
my
brain
works
overmuch
stay
the
wheels
with
thy
soft
touch
just
a
quiet
thought
of
thee
and
of
thy
sweet
charity
just
a
little
prayer
and
then
i
will
turn
to
sleep
again
the
bells
of
ys
when
the
bells
of
ys
rang
softly
softly
and
sweet
and
not
a
sound
was
heard
in
the
old
gray
town
as
the
silvery
tones
came
floating
down
but
life
stood
still
with
uncovered
head
and
doers
of
ill
did
good
instead
and
abroad
the
peace
of
god
was
shed
the
bells
aloft
sang
softly
softly
soft
and
sweet
and
low
the
silver
bells
and
the
golden
bells
aloft
and
aloft
and
and
still
those
bells
ring
softly
softly
and
sweet
and
though
full
twelve
hundred
years
have
gone
since
the
waves
rolled
over
the
old
gray
town
bold
men
of
the
sea
in
the
grip
of
the
flow
still
hear
the
bells
as
they
pass
and
go
or
win
to
life
with
their
hearts
aglow
the
bells
below
sing
softly
softly
soft
and
sweet
and
low
the
silver
bells
and
the
golden
bells
alow
and
alow
and
o
the
mystical
bells
they
still
ring
softly
and
sweet
and
for
the
sound
of
their
singing
shall
never
die
in
the
hearts
that
are
tuned
to
their
melody
and
down
in
the
world
wild
rush
and
roar
that
sweeps
us
along
to
the
opening
door
hearts
still
beat
high
as
they
beat
of
yore
the
bells
sing
softly
softly
softly
soft
and
sweet
and
low
the
silver
bells
and
the
golden
bells
alow
and
aloft
and
the
little
poem
of
life
i
thou
we
they
small
words
but
mighty
in
their
span
are
bound
the
life
and
hopes
of
man
for
first
his
thoughts
of
his
own
self
are
full
until
another
comes
his
heart
to
rule
for
them
life
best
is
centred
round
their
love
till
younger
lives
come
all
their
love
to
prove
cup
of
mixture
for
every
guest
who
comes
with
him
to
sup
the
host
compounds
a
strangely
mingled
cup
red
wine
of
life
and
dregs
of
bitterness
and
each
must
drink
it
up
weavers
all
warp
and
woof
and
tangle
of
webs
are
living
and
dying
and
mightier
dead
for
the
shuttle
once
sped
is
sped
is
sped
of
webs
are
white
and
black
and
of
webs
are
to
every
weaver
one
golden
strand
is
given
in
trust
by
the
of
webs
are
and
that
we
weave
we
know
not
of
webs
are
the
threads
we
see
but
the
pattern
is
known
to
the
alone
alone
of
webs
are
the
clearer
vision
when
with
bowed
head
and
tears
with
mingled
hopes
and
fears
to
earth
we
yield
our
dead
the
saints
with
clearer
sight
do
cry
in
glad
accord
soul
released
from

is
risen
is
risen
is
risen
to
the
glory
of
the
shadows
shadows
are
but
for
the
moment
quickly
past
and
then
the
sun
the
brighter
shines
that
it
was
overcast
for
light
is
life
gracious
and
sweet
the
fair
sun
doth
scatter
blessings
with
his
light
and
heat
and
shadows
but
the
shadows
that
come
of
the
sun
crouch
at
his
feet
no
mortal
life
but
has
its
shadowed
times
not
one
life
without
shadow
could
not
taste
the
full
sweet
glory
of
the
sun
no
shadow
falls
but
there
behind
it
stands
the
light
behind
the
wrongs
and
sorrows
of
life
troublous
ways
stands
right
the
inn
of
life
it
was
in
the
beginning
is
now
and
anno
domini
no
room
no
room
the
inn
is
full
yea
overfull
no
room
have
we
for
such
as
ye
poor
folk
of
galilee
pass
on
pass
on
nay
then
your
charity
will
deny
some
corner
mean
where
she
may
lie
unseen
for
see
her
time
is
nigh
alack
and
she
so
young
and
fair
place
have
we
none
and
yet
how
bid
ye
gone
stay
then
out
there
among
the
beasts
ye
may
find
room
and
eke
a
truss
to
lie
upon
domini
no
room
no
room
no
room
for
thee
thou
man
of
galilee
the
house
is
full
yea
overfull
there
is
no
room
for
thee
pass
on
pass
on
nay
see
the
place
is
packed
we
scarce
have
room
for
our
own
selves
so
how
shall
we
find
room
for
thee
thou
man
of
galilee
pass
on
pass
on
but
if
thou
shouldst
this
way
again
and
we
can
find
so
much
as
one
small
corner
free
from
guest
not
then
in
vain
thy
quest
but
now
the
house
is
full
pass
on
christ
passes
on
his
ceaseless
quest
nor
will
he
rest
with
any
save
as
chiefest
guest
life
is
all
a
of
nights
and
days
where
detiny
with
men
for
pieces
plays
hither
and
thither
moves
and
mates
and
slays
and
one
by
one
back
in
the
closet
lays
a
of
mingled
light
and
shade
and
we
the
pieces
on
it
deftly
laid
moved
and
removed
without
a
word
to
say
by
the
same
hand
that
board
and
pieces
made
no
pieces
we
in
any
fateful
game
nor
free
to
shift
on
destiny
the
blame
each
soul
doth
tend
its
own
immortal
flame
fans
it
to
heaven
or
smothers
it
in
shame
oft
as
he
jogs
along
the
occasion
comes
for
every
man
to
say
this
road
or
that
and
as
he
chooses
them
so
shall
his
journey
end
in
night
or
day
quo
vadis
peter
outworn
and
menaced
by
the
sword
shook
off
the
dust
of
rome
and
as
he
fled
met
one
with
eager
face
hastening
cityward
and
to
his
vast
amaze
it
was
the
lord
whither
goest
he
cried
importunate
and
christ
replied
i
suffer
loss
i
go
to
take
thy
place
to
bear
thy
then
peter
bowed
his
head
discomforted
there
at
the
master
feet
found
grace
complete
and
courage
and
new
faith
and
turned
with
him
to
death
so
we
we
fail
of
our
full
duty
cast
on
him
our
load
who
suffered
sore
for
us
who
frail
flesh
wore
for
us
who
all
things
bore
for
us
on

the
lord
tamate
is
dead
they
the
teacher
the
joyous
the
fearless
the

of
sweet
white
fire
is
dead
they

holding
the

into

the

shall
burn
the
brighter
and
the
night
shall
be

for
his
sowing

dead

what
is
death
to
such
an
one

perchance
for

on
his

kindle
many
a

there
are

prayer
for

was
changed

stephen

stephen

died

in
his
death
the
making
of
a

repenting

one
fighter
for

stephen
the

triumphant
and
forgiving
prayed
while
the
hot
blows
beat
him
to
the
earth
was
that
a
dying
rather
was
it
living
through
his
soul
travail
my
soul
came
to
birth
stephen
the
martyr
full
of
faith
and
fearless
smiled
when
his
bruised
lips
could
no
longer
pray
smiled
with
a
courage
undismayed
and
peerless
smiled
and
that
smile
is
with
me
night
and
day
o
was
it
that
stood
there
all
consenting
at
whose
feet
the
young

clothes
were
laid
was
it

that
wrought
that
hot
tormenting
my
heart
that
boasted
over
stephen
dead
yes
it
was

and
sore
to
me
the
telling
yes
it
was

compelling
these

darknesses
for
him
to
win
paul
to

in

rejoicing
earmarked
to
him
i
counted
less
than
nought
his
man
henceforward
eager
to
be
voicing
that
wondrous
love
which
saul
the
roman
sought
sought
him
and
found
him
working
bitter
sorrow
found
him
and
claimed
him
chose
him
for
his

him
in
darkness
till
the
glorious
morrow
unsealed
his

to
that
he

not

wakening
this
mortal

in
the
moment
when
the
light
fails
here
the
darkness
opens
and
the
vision
clear
breaks
on
his
eyes
the

this
terrible
fact
kept
the
his

they
are
snug

warm

safe
from

in

and
the
dogs
and
i
by
the
blazing
fire
care
nought
for
the

and
the
cold
where
is
my
lamb
my
one
ewe
lamb
that
strayed
from

bursting
with
their

of

we
have
seen
brave
times
you
and
i
old
friend
but
now
we
are
growing
old
we
have
stood
foursquare
to
many
a
storm
but
now
we
are
growing

my
lamb
my
one
ewe
lamb
that
strayed
from

mother
sleeps
on
the
hill
out
there
is
the
night
and
she
is
free
from
care
she
is
happier
there
beneath
the
warm
brown
mould
and
i
sometimes
hoped
they
may
have
met
and
the
end
of
the
tale
be
told
where

ewe
lamb

or
was
it
a
footstep
in
the
snow
a
timid
footstep
halting

my

at
the
frozen
pane
on
the
night

thank
thee

is
home
again
my
lamb

strayed
from

wee

the
times
be
dark
and
dreary
though
the
way
be
long
keep
your
spirits
bright
and
cheery
bide
a
wee
and
dinna
weary
is
a
heartsome
song
the
word
that
was
left
unsaid
a
red
rose
for
my
helmet
and
a
word
before
we
part
the
rose
shall
be
my
oriflamme
the
word
shall
fill
my
heart
heart
heart
of
my
heart
just
a
look
just
a
word
and
a
look
a
look
or
a
sign
that
my
love
shall
divine
and
a
word
for
my
hungering
she
toyed
with
his
love
and
her
roses
was
it
mischief
or
mischance
she
dropped
him
a
rose
was
a
white
one
and
he
lifted
it
on
his
lance
heart
heart
of
my
heart
is
it
thus
is
it
thus
we
part
with
never
a
look
and
never
a
sign
nor
a
word
for
my
hungering
she
sought
him
among
the
dying
she
found
him
among
the
dead
and
the
rose
was
still
in
his
helmet
but
his
life
had
stained
it
red
heart
heart
of
my
heart
now
my
heart
within
me
is
dead
and
alack
for
the
look
and
alas
for
the
sign
and
the
word
that
was
left
do
worry
just
do
your
best
and
leave
the
rest
to
him
who
gave
you
life
and
zeal
for
labour
and
the
joy
of
strife
and
zest
of
love
and
all
that
lifts
your
soul
above
the
lower
things
life
truest

aught

before

the
good

of

became
the
christ
and
lived
on
earth
the
living
love
of
god
that
men
might
draw
to
closer
touch
with
heaven
since
christ
in
all
the
ways
of
man
hath
trod
the
ballad
of
lost
souls
with
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
they
bought
the
potter
field
for
none
would
have
the
and
the
interest
it
might
yield
the
place
of
blood
for
the
price
of
blood
and
that
was
meet
i
ween
for
there
they
would
bury
the
dead
who
died
in
frowardness
and
sin
and
the
first
man
they
would
bury
there
was
judas
iscariot
and
that
was
as
dreadful
a
burying
as
ever
was
i
wot
for
the
sick
earth
would
not
keep
him
each
time
it
thrust
him
out
and
they
that
would
have
buried
him
stood
shuddering
round
about
and
others
they
would
bury
in
that
unhallowed
spot
but
honest
earth
would
none
of
them
because
of
iscariot
and
oh
it
was
a
fell
fell
place
with
dead
black
trees
all
round
and
a
quag
that
boiled
and
writhed
and
coiled
where
had
been
solid
ground
for
every
tree
that
stood
there
and
the
green
grass
every
blade
shrivelled
and
died
on
every
side
whenever
the
price
was
paid
and
in
despair
they
left
him
there
and
there
his
body
lay
till
his
sad
soul
came
all
black
with
shame
and
carried
it
away
and
those
denied
a
sepulture
in
that
most
dismal
spot
gibbered
and
flew
a
ghastly
crew
incensed
with
rage
that
grew
and
grew
against
iscariot
for
their
souls
were
all
in
torment
while
their
bodies
uncovered
lay
and
never
a
moment
rest
was
theirs
either
by
night
or
day
that
was
a
place
of
wailings
and
the
grisly
things
of
death
the
bare
black
arms
of
the
trees
above
and
the
black
quag
underneath
no
light
of
the
moon
fell
on
it
nor
ever
a
star
did
shine
on
the
quivering
face
of
that
dread
place
because
of
iscariot
sin
then
there
came
by
the
soul
of
iscariot
the
same
who
sold
his
lord
and
he
dragged
his
body
after
him
but
never
spake
a
word
since
earth
his
body
would
not
he
must
drag
it
to
and
fro
he
had
tried
in
vain
to
be
quit
of
it
but
it
would
not
let
him
go
so
the
soul
of
judas
iscariot
came
by
the
potter
field
and
there
the
ill
his
deed
had
wrought
was
unto
him
revealed
and
when
the
others
saw
him
they
leaped
at
him
eagerly
this
is
he
for
whom
we
suffer
is
he
is
he
is
he
then
all
afire
with
mad
desire
they
chased
him
through
the
dark
and
each
soul
carried
his
dead
bodie
grim
and
stiff
and
stark
they
struck
at
him
with
their
bodies
they
cursed
him
for
his
sin
they
made
to
tear
his
dumb
soul
there
with
their
fingers
long
and
lean
and
judas
fled
in
his
horror
with
that
fell
crew
behind
and
as
they
sped
the
people
said
death
rode
upon
the
wind
they
chased
him
near
they
chased
him
far
because
of
his
treachery
and
ever
he
just
escaped
their
lust
and
ever
they
were
nigh
they
chased
him
near
they
chased
him
far
and
ever
they
were
nigh
and
never
a
star
shone
out
on
them
out
of
the
cold
black
sky
and
as
they
sped
by
calvary
there
were
empty
crosses
three
and
on
the
ground
below
the
mound
lay
one
in
agony
times
i
swore
i
knew
him
not
and
then
he
looked
on
me
ah
such
a
look
no
harshest
word
had
ever
proved
so
sharp
a
sword
to
my
times
i
did
deny
thee
lord
and
yet
thou
couldst
forgive
now
am
i
thine
in
life
in
death
thee
will
i
serve
with
every
breath
while
i
have
breath
to
they
sped
by
an
open
window
where
one
knelt
all
alone
in
great
amaze
in
greater
grief
in
woe
that
wrestled
with
belief
the
mother
mourned
her
son
son
i
knew
thee
more
than
man
ah
me
and
the
heart
of
me
yet
man
in
god
and
god
in
man
still
wast
thou
part
of
nails
through
thy
dear
hands
and
feet
ah
me
they
pierced
my
own
the
thorns
that
on
thy
brow
they
plied
the
spear
they
drove
into
thy
side
the
pangs
thy
godhead
could
not
hide
they
pierced
me
too
my
son
my
son
my
more
than
son
my
heart
is
full
for
thee
yet
tho
i
know
thee
so
much
more
than
ever
mortal
man
before
yet
tho
i
worship
and
adore
woe
me
and
the
heart
of
and
ever
they
came
by
the
potter
field
and
thrust
their
bodies
in
and
ever
the
sick
earth
spat
them
out
because
of
iscariot
sin
they
sped
along
a
the
feast
waxed
high
inside
on
golgotha
the
cross
still
stood
the
cross
where
man
had
nailed
his
god
red
was
the
rood
still
with
his
blood
they
drank
the
revel
gashed
the
sombre
night
and
fast
the
plied
time
touched
eternity
that
day
god
had
come
down
to
man
that
day
the
world
began
anew
that
day
they
drank
and
ever
again
to
the
potter
field
the
souls
in
torment
came
but
the
black
quag
boiled
and
writhed
and
coiled
and
would
have
none
of
them
and
everywhere
strange
shapes
of
death
walked
in
the
fearsome
gloom
for
that
last
cry
from
calvary
had
rent
in
twain
the
temple
vail
and
burst
the
gates
of
doom
through
all
the
startled
city
walked
the
saints
that
had
been
dead
and
to
the
sorrowful
in
heart
holy
comfort
ministrèd
and
when
they
met
iscariot
sore
hounded
in
the
chase
they
cried
to
him
for
the
love
of
god
to
seek
god
grace
and
ever
to
the
field
of
death
the
souls
in
torment
came
seeking
the
rest
of
the
blessèd
dead
but
earth
would
none
of
them
and
as
they
whirled
through
a
garden
they
came
on
an
empty
tomb
the
stone
was
gone
a
soft
light
shone
full
softly
on
the
gloom
bright
was
that
light
and
wondrous
bright
brighter
than
the
sun
as
then
it
shone
so
shines
it
now
and
shall
when
time
is
done
and
all
along
the
pathway
was
a
track
of
throbbing
light
where
the
christ
had
gone
his
footsteps
shone
like
stars
in
a
velvet
night
was
the
spent
soul
of
iscariot
was
like
the
dust
as
nearer
still
and
near
and
near
he
bent
and
crept
in
doubt
and
fear
he
came
because
he
must
was
the
sick
soul
of
iscariot
that
drew
from
out
the
night
and
the
full
of
his
sin
was
known
to
him
in
the
shining
of
the
light
in
the
rim
of
the
light
he
laid
him
repented
of
his
sin
wotted
not
i
wotted
not
dear
master
take
me
and
as
he
lay
there
sorrowing
up
came
the
felon
crew
they
flailed
him
with
their
dead
bodies
they
heeded
not
his
rue
they
flailed
him
with
their
dead
bodies
they
heeded
not
their
spleen
wotted
not
i
wotted
not
dear
master
take
me
and
then
a
vision
and
a
voice
and
the
word
made
manifest
down
thy
load
where
i
abode
and
i
will
give
thee
ye
no
more
hunt
iscariot
he
repents
him
of
his
sin
and
never
a
soul
that
repenteth
but
he
may
enter
day
the
door
is
opened
that
shall
never
close
again
and
never
a
soul
that
would
come
in
shall
seek
to
come
in
and
the
dead
soul
of
iscariot
was
born
again
that
night
for
the
lord
christ
came
dead
souls
to
claim
and
lead
them
into
light
and
the
souls
of
the
unburied
when
they
looked
upon
his
face
were
cleansed
of
sin
and
entered
in
to
his
redeeming
grace
so
by
that
wonderful
great
love
which
highest
heaven
extols
to
mother
earth
their
dead
bodies
and
unto
christ
their
souls
profit
and
loss
profit
loss
who
shall
declare
this
good
that
ill
when
good
and
ill
so
intertwine
but
to
fulfil
the
vast
design
of
an
omniscient
will
when
seeming
gain
but
turns
to
loss
when
earthly
treasure
proves
but
dross
and
what
seemed
loss
but
turns
again
to
high
eternal
gain
wisest
the
man
who
does
his
best
and
leaves
the
rest
to
him
who
counts
not
deeds
alone
but
sees
the
root
the
flower
the
fruit
and
calls
them
one
free
men
of
god
free
men
of
god
the
new
day
breaks
in
golden
gleams
across
the
sky
the
darkness
of
the
night
is
past
this
is
the
day
of
victory
for
this
our
fathers
strove
in
stern
and
fiery
love
that
men
to
come
should
be
born
into
liberty
that
all
should
be
as
we
are
free
free
men
of
god
gird
up
your
loins
and
brace
you
for
the
final
fight
strike
home
strike
home
for
truth
and
right
yet
bear
yourselves
as
in
his
sight
for
this
our
fathers
fought
this
with
their
lives
they
bought
that
you
and
i
should
be
heirs
of
their
liberty
that
all
should
be
as
we
are
free
free
men
we
are
and
so
will
be
we
claim
free
access
unto
him
who
widened
all
the
bounds
of
life
and
us
from
bondage
did
redeem
let
no
man
intervene
or
draw
a
vail
between
us
and
our
god
for
he
would
have
his
people
free
and
we
would
be
as
thou
art
free
free
men
of
god
your
birthright
claim
our
fathers
won
it
with
a
price
they
paid
in
full
to
axe
and
flame
nor
counted
up
the
sacrifice
this
is
our
heritage
and
here
we
do
engage
each
man
unto
his
son
intact
to
pass
it
on
so
shall
they
be
as
we
are
free
our
sure
defence
in
times
of
stress
thy
gates
stand
open
wide
and
free
when
men
provoke
and
wrongs
oppress
we
seek
thy
wider
liberty
with
loftier
mind
and
heart
let
each
man
bear
his
part
so
to
the
final
fight
and
god
defend
the
right
we
shall
we
must
we
will
be
free
lord
christ
let
me
but
hold
thy
hand
and
all
the
rest
may
go
for
nothing
is
but
only
seems
and
life
is
full
of
idle
dreams
until
thyself
we
know
the
whole
wide
world
is
nought
beside
the
wonder
of
thy
love
and
though
my
state
be
mean
and
strait
give
me
but
heart
to
work
and
wait
and
i
have
the
gate
a
little
child
shall
lead
them
i
trod
an
arduous
way
but
came
at
last
to
where
the
city
walls
rose
fair
and
white
above
the
darkening
plain
a
goodly
sight
and
eagerly
while
yet
a
great
way
off
my
eyes
did
seek
the
gates
the
great
white
gates
that
close
not
ever
day
or
night
but
stand
wide
as
the
love
of
christ
that
opened
them
but
nought
could
i
discern
of
gate
or
breach
the
wall
stood
flawless
far
as
eye
could
reach
but
when
i
drew
in
closer
to
the
wall
i
saw
a
lowly
portal
strait
and
small
so
small
a
man
might
hardly
enter
there
and
shadowed
and
to
earth
a
very
needle
eye
scarce
visible
i
looked
and
wondered
could
this
trivial
way
be
the
sole
entrance
to
the
light
of
day
and
as
i
stood
perplext
a
clear
voice
cried
enter
in
the
gate
is
open
and
while
i
stood
in
doubt
there
came
along
one
of
earth
mighty
ones
a
conqueror
of
kings
he
looked
for
gates
that
should
swing
wide
to
meet
his
high
estate
and
welcome
him
he
stood
and
gazed
then
raised
his
voice
and
cried
my
work
on
earth
is
done
i
would
within
and
from
the
city
wall
the
voice
replied
enter
in
the
gate
is
open
he
stood
perplext
then
set
himself
to
wait
till
might
should
help
him
to
discern
the
gate
another
came
a
man
of
mind
so
rare
he
scarce
had
breathed
the
common
earthly
air
knowledge
was
his
and
wisdom
so
profound
all
things
he
knew
in
heaven
and
earth
no
bound
to
his
accomplishment
until
he
sought
the
great
gate
and
found
it
not
he
stood
perplext
and
then
cried
wearily
pray
give
me
entrance
i
am
done
with
earth
and
from
the
city
wall
the
clear
voice
cried
enter
in
the
gate
is
open
he
looked
in
vain
then
set
himself
to
wait
till
wisdom
should
direct
him
to
the
gate
i
saw
a
woman
come
noble
and
fair
and
pure
of
heart
and
in
her
goodly
deeds
more
richly
robed
than
fashion
fairest
queen
and
to
myself
i
said
surely
for
her
a
way
will
open
that
she
may
go
in
she
said
no
word
but
stood
and
looked
upon
the
shining
walls
with
eyes
that
answering
shone
and
from
the
city
wall
the
clear
voice
cried
enter
in
the
gate
is
open
she
looked
in
vain
then
set
herself
to
wait
till
love
should
help
her
to
discern
the
gate
and
one
there
came
with
clear
keen
face
a
judge
of
men
on
earth
and
famed
for
fearless
truth
his
robes
were
stainless
and
his
heart
was
clean
entrance
i
crave
he
cried
to
rest
and
justice
and
no
more
and
from
the
city
wall
the
clear
voice
cried
enter
in
the
gate
is
open
he
looked
in
vain
then
set
himself
to
wait
till
judgment
should
direct
him
to
the
gate
and
one
there
came
his
brow
still
raw
from
pressure
of
an
earthly
crown
he
too
sought
glorious
entrance
through
gates
and
stood
perplext
he
had
borne
well
his
part
and
served
his
people
and
his
god
and
died
the
martyr
death
and
yet
he
found
no
gate
i
fain
would
rest
he
cried
my
life
has
been
one
ceaseless
striving
i
would
enter
in
and
from
the
city
wall
the
clear
voice
cried
enter
in
the
gate
is
open
perplext
he
stood
then
set
himself
to
wait
till
patient
waiting
should
discern
the
gate
and
one
who
had
had
riches
beyond
most
and
yet
subserved
them
to
his
master
good
came
searching
for
the
heavenly
gates
and
stood
amazed
to
find
no
opening
in
the
walls
i
gave
of
all
i
had
he
cried
and
held
nought
as
my
own
yet
entrance
is
denied
and
from
the
city
wall
the
clear
voice
cried
enter
in
the
gate
is
open
he
stood
perplext
then
set
himself
to
wait
till
charity
should
point
him
to
the
gate
and
many
more
there
were
who
entrance
craved
and
sought
the
great
white
gates
and
stood
perplext
and
ever
from
within
the
clear
voice
cried
enter
in
the
gate
is
open
they
sought
in
vain
and
set
themselves
to
wait
till
light
was
given
them
to
discern
the
gate
and
then
a
child
in
white
came
carolling
along
the
arduous
road
we
all
had
trod
he
stopped
and
looked
then
laughed
with
childish
glee
wait
ye
here
without
come
follow
and
passed
scarce
bending
through
the
lowly
door
we
heard
his
singing
him
we
saw
no
more
the
woman
stooped
and
looked
with
eyes
that
shone
into
the
doorway
where
the
child
had
gone
then
loosed
her
robes
and
dropped
and
in
a
shift
of
pure
white
samite
on
her
hands
and
knees
she
crept
into
the
doorway
and
was
gone
and
we
stood
gazing
at
the
way
she
went
and
one
by
one
they
followed
first
the
judge
laid
by
his
robes
and
bowed
him
to
the
ground
and
followed
where
the
little
child
had
led
and
he
whose
brow
had
borne
that
weighty
crown
bent
low
and
followed
where
the
little
child
had
led
and
he
who
knew
so
much
of
earthly
things
discarded
them
and
on
his
hands
and
knees
crept
through
the
doorway
where
the
little
child
had
led
and
he
of
riches
laid
him
in
the
dust
and
followed
where
the
little
child
had
led
and
last
of
all
the
war
lord
cast
aside
his
victor
wreaths
and
all
his
pomp
and
pride
and
followed
where
the
little
child
had
led
and
groping
through
my
fears
i
bowed
my
head
and
followed
where
the
little
child
had
led
bring
us
the
light
i
hear
a
clear
voice
calling
calling
calling
out
of
the
night
o
you
who

in
the

is

i
faced
a
future
all
unknown
no
opening
could
i
see
i
heard
without
the
night
wind
moan
the
ways
were
dark
to
me
i
can
not
face
it
all
alone
o
be
thou
near
to
me
i
had
done
sums
and
sums
and
sums
inside
my
aching
head
i
tried
in
vain
to
pierce
the
glooms
that
lay
so
thick
ahead
but
two
and
two
will
not
make
five
nor
will
do
when
i
dead
and
then
i
thought
of
him
who
fed
five
thousand
hungry
men
with
five
small
casual
loaves
of
bread
would
he
were
here
again
dear
god
hast
thou
still
miracles
for
the
troubled
sons
of
men
he
has
he
will
he
worketh
still
in
ways
most
wonderful
he
drew
me
from
the
miry
clay
he
filled
my
cup
quite
full
and
while
my
heart
can
speak
i
tell
his
love
unspeakable
rest
in
the
lord
i
saw
it
there
on
the
tablets
of
the
night
and
comforted
i
dropped
my
care
where
burdens
have
no
weight
then
trustfully
i
turned
and
slept
and
woke
and
it
was
light
god
works
as
he
did
of
old
for
the
lightening
of
men
woes
his
wonders
never
can
be
told
his
goodness
no
man
knows
his
love
his
power
his
tenderness
nor
shall
do
till
life
close
his
kindness
is
so
very
great
his
greatness
is
so
good
he
looks
upon
my
low
estate
he
gives
me
daily
food
and
nothing
is
too
small
for
him
yes
truly
god
is
good
some
and
some
some
have
much
and
some
have
more
some
are
rich
and
some
are
poor
some
have
little
some
have
less
some
have
not
a
cent
to
bless
their
empty
pockets
yet
possess
true
riches
in
true
happiness
the
prince
of
life
o
prince
of
life
thy
life
hath
tuned
all
life
to
sweeter
loftier
grace
life
common
rounds
have
wider
bounds
since
thou
hast
trod
life
common
ways
o
heart
of
love
thy
tenderness
still
runs
through
life
remotest
vein
and
lust
and
greed
and
soulless
creed
shall
never
rule
the
world
again
o
life
of
love
the
good
intent
of
god
to
man
made
evident

on

where

there

bolted
against

there
are
faces
set
like

and
over

all
the
shadow
of

hangs
like

you
hear
the
voices
calling
out
there
in

black
of

night
do
you
hear
the
sobs
of
the
women
who
are
barred
from
the
blessed
light

the

the

do
you

cry

spread

a

a

a

to
ancient

a

a
land
of
superstitions
vast
and
grim
and
all
the
noisome

that
darkness
breeds
like

the

beats
up
against

seeks
vain
entrance
yet
beats
on

in
hopeful
faith
which
all
defeat
ignores

time
shall
come
when
like

swelling
tide
the
word
shall
leap
the
barriers

the

shall
sweep
the

and

shall
win
for

this

up

of

with

was
wrapped

fearful
hopeful
all

crept
along
the

path
hardly
breathing
at

thus
to

bending
low
lest

should
see

went
with

as

fearless
as

on

bent
climbed
the

of

to

while

blanched

if

would
but
dare
i
stood
unseen
within
a
sumptous
room
where
one
clothed
all
in
white
sat
silently
so
sweet
his
presence
that
a
pure
soft
light
rayed
from
him
and
i
saw
most
wondrous
sight
the
love
of
god
shrined
in
the
flesh
once
more
and
glowing
softly
like
a
misted
sun
his
back
was
towards
me
had
i
seen
his
face
methought
i
must
have
fallen
i
was
wrong
the
door
flung
wide
with
hasty
step
came
one
in
royal
robes
and
all
the
pride
and
pomp
of
majesty
and
on
his
head
a
helmet
with
an
eagle
poised
for
flight
he
stood
amazed
at
sight
of
him
in
white
his
lips
apart
in
haughty
questioning
but
no
words
came
breathless
he
raised
his
hand
and
gave
salute
as
to
a
mightier
lord
and
doffed
his
helm
and
stood
and
in
his
eyes
i
saw
the
reflex
glory
of
his
master
face
the
master
spoke
his
voice
so
soft
and
sweet
thrilled
my
heart
core
and
shook
me
where
i
stood
runs
apace
the
new
time

at

it
be

rests
thee
in
dumb
amaze

cast
his
lot
for
peace

can
not
compass

it
be
peace
or

rests
thee
again

his
head
amazed

swerved
a
hair
breadth
in
his
gaze

hands
with
him

to

and
still
the

shook
his
head
amazed

be
peace
or

of
lives
are
in
thy
hand

with
thee
then

it
be
peace

map
unrolled
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
and
every
kingdom
groaned
with
the
burden
of
its
and
the
weight
grew
till
man
was
crushed
beneath
and
lost
his
manhood
and
became
a
cog
to
roll
along
the
great
machine
of
war
and
as
he
watched
the
eyes
flamed
fire
his
nostrils
panted
like
a
mettled
steed
this
was
the
game
of
games
he
knew
and
loved
and
every
fibre
of
his
soul
was
knit
to
see
what
passed
then
in
a
land
where
a
great
sea
poured
out
through
narrow
gates
to
meet
a
greater
came
the
clang
of
arms
and
drew
the
nations
like
a
tocsin
peal
till
all
the
sands
ran
red
and
earth
sweat
blood
and
writhed
in
fiery
ashes
and
grew
sick
with
all
the
reek
and
stench
of
war
and
heaven
drew
back
behind
the
and
ever
through
the
clamour
of
the
strife
i
heard
the
ceaseless
wailing
of
a
child
and
the
sobbing
sobbing
sobbing
endless
sobbing
of
a
reft
and
broken
woman
and
the
hoarse
whisper
of
the
voice
britain
fights
once
again
for
barbary
lest
others
occupy
to
her
undoing
and
italy
and
greece
and
turkey
join
to
beat
back
france
and
spain
again
i
saw
where
legions
marched
and
wound
snowy
peaks
and
came
upon
a
smiling
land
and
filled
it
with
the
reek
and
stench
of
war
the
hoarse
voice
spoke
the
provinces
she
stole
and
lost
austria
takes
back
again
i
saw
where
hosts
crept
swiftly
to
the
straits
twixt
old
and
new
and
drenched
the
land
with
blood
and
filled
it
with
the
reek
and
stench
of
war
the
spoke
despite
his
love
of
peace
our
brother
of
the
north
has
seized
his
chance
and
got
his
heart
desire
again
i
saw
where
legions
poured
through
the
eternal
snows
and
legions
swept
every
sea
to
meet
their
onslaught
and
the
dead
were
piled
in
mountains
and
the
snows
ran
red
the
spoke
up
britain
up
strike
home
or
drop
your
rod
of
empire
in
the
dust
one
of
you
dies
this
day
again
i
saw
beneath
us
legions
swarming
to
the
west
devouring
kingdoms
till
they
reached
the
sea
and
filling
all
the
lands
with
blood
and
fire
the
gazed
with
eyes
that
blazed
and
flamed
and
panted
like
a
soul
in
torment
mine
all
these
are
mine
sayest
thou
thine
now
when
thou
shalt
stand
before
me
then
i
shall
require
them
of
thus
the
voice
of
him
who
sat
and
gazed
with
sorrowing
face
while
all
the
earth
beneath
us
reeked
of
war
and
heaven
grew
dim
behind
the
and
ever
through
the
clamour
of
the
strife
i
heard
the
ceaseless
wailing
of
a
child
and
the
sobbing
sobbing
sobbing
endless
sobbing
of
a
reft
and
broken
woman
it
be
peace
or
a
sword
could
cut
no
sharper
than
the
gentle
voice
of
him
who
bowed
with
sorrow
at
the
sight
of
man
destroying
man
for
sake
of
gain
i
waited
breathless
for
the
warrior
word
but
no
word
came
his
heart
was
with
his
men
it
be
peace
or
war
look
yet
and
at
their
feet
like
mighty
map
unrolled
lay
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
at
peace
the
glad
earth
smiled
beneath
a
smiling
heaven
and
brought
forth
fruit
for
all
her
children
needs
the
desert
lands
had
blossomed
and
the
earth
was
large
enough
for
all
her
voice
came
up
a
murmur
of
content
like
bees
that
labour
gladly
on
the
comb
the
reign
of
peace
and
yet
an
army
lay
couchant
and
watchful
ready
for
the
strife
if
strife
need
be
the
strife
of
quelling
strife
an
army
culled
in
part
from
all
the
lands
owning
no
master
but
the
public
weal
and
prompt
to
quench
the
first
red
spark
of
war
even
as
we
watched
a
frontier
turmoil
rose
and
therewith
rose
the
army
and
the
fire
died
out
while
scarce
begun
the
smoke
of
it
was
scarcely
seen
the
noise
scarce
heard
for
all
the
lands
with
war
had
welcomed
peace
and
bowed
to
mightier
forces
than
their
own
men
cast
aside
their
armour
and
their
arms
and
lived
men
lives
and
were
no
more
machines
shall
there
be
indeed
till
that
last
war
that
shall
wage
war
on
war
and
sweep
the
earth
of
all
and
of
all
so
spake
the
voice
and
ceased
and
still
we
gazed
a
great
white
building
on
its
topmost
tower
a
great
white
flag
proclaimed
a
world
tribunal
for
the
righting
of
the
nations
wrongs
and
that
great
army
answered
its
behests
and
owned
allegiance
to
no
other
head
peace
reigned
triumphant
on
the
quiet
air
i
heard
the
merry
laughter
of
the
child
and
the
great
sigh
of
gratitude
that
rose
from
all
the
of
all
the
world
it
be
peace
or
once
more
the
voice
one
man
is
it
given
to
thou
art
the
man
scales
are
thy
think
well
and
say
shall
it
be
peace
or
war
as
thou
shalt
say
so
shall
it
be
with
but
ere
the
answer
came
all
vanished
like
a
scrap
of
paper
in
a
fire
of
coals
then
with
a
crackling
peal
the
thick
black
vail
that
hangs
before
the
face
of
men
was
rent
and
in
the
instant
lightning
flash
i
saw
a
chamber
hung
with
black
and
heaped
with
flowers
where
candles
tall
flashed
white
on
watchers
swords
high
on
a
bier
lay
one
at
rest
crosses
and
orders
on
his
quiet
breast
head
proudly
cushioned
on
his
country
flag
hands
calmly
folded
on
his
helmet
crest
his
back
to
earth
his
mute
face
turned
to
heaven
answering
the
summons
of
his
i
strained
my
eyes
upon
his
face
to
learn
thereon
his
answer
but
the
dark
vail
dropped
and
left
me
wondering
what
his
word
had
been
had
i
but
read
his
face
i
should
have
known
who
lay
man
like
other
men
or
one
who
grasped
the
greater
things
and
by
his
will
brought
peace
on
earth
and
drew
earth
nearer
heaven
the
bells
beat
softly
on
the
midnight
air
proclaiming
the
new
time
shall
it
be
peace
a
voice
within
me
cried
and
would
not
cease
man
could
do
it
if
he
would
but
this
was
written
in
at
the
time
of
the
tzar
rescript
to
the
powers
suggesting
a
peace
conference
with
a
view
to
the
lightening
of
the
burden
of
arms
the
possibilities
have
changed
their
faces
but
at
heart
the
great
problem
remains
much
the
same
and
above
all
the
great
fact
remains
that
if
great
britain
germany
russia
and
the
united
states
joined
hands
for
a
world
peace
they
could
ensure
it
germany
is
still
mistrustful
on
her
lies
a
great
responsibility
your
place
is
your
place
a
small
place
tend
it
with
care
he
set
you
there
is
your
place
a
large
place
guard
it
with
care
he
set
you
there
whatever
your
place
it
is
not
yours
alone
but
his
who
set
you
there
in
narrow
ways
some
lives
are
set
in
narrow
ways
by
love
wise
tenderness
they
seem
to
suffer
all
their
days
life
direst
storm
and
stress
but
god
shall
raise
them
up
at
length
his
purposes
are
sure
he
for
their
weakness
shall
give
strength
for
every
ill
a
cure
shut
windows
the
braille
when
the
outer
eye
grows
dim
turns
the
inner
eye
to
him
who
makes
darkness
light
fairer
visions
you
may
see
live
in
nobler
company
and
in
larger
liberty
than
the
men
of
sight
he
sometimes
shuts
the
windows
but
to
open
hidden
doors
where
all
who
will
may
wander
bold
and
free
for
his
house
has
many
mansions
and
the
mansions
many
floors
and
every
room
is
free
to
you
and
me
props
earthly
props
are
useless
on
thy
grace
i
fall
earthly
strength
is
weakness
father
on
thee
i
call
for
comfort
strength
and
guidance
o
give
me
all
i
have
been
tried
tried
in
the
fire
and
i
say
this
as
the
result
of
dire
distress
and
tribulation
sore
that
a
man
happiness
doth
not
consist
of
that
he
hath
but
of
the
faith
and
trust
in
god
great
love
these
bring
him
to
nought
else
is
worth
consideration
for
the
peace
a
man
may
find
in
perfect
trust
in
god
outweighs
all
else
and
is
the
only
possible
foundation
for
true
happiness
after
work
lord
when
thou
seest
that
my
work
is
done
let
me
not
linger
on
with
failing
powers
adown
the
weary
hours
a
workless
worker
in
a
world
of
work
but
with
a
word
just
bid
me
home
and
i
will
come

gladly
yea

whose
personal
acquaintance
with
the
south

and
their
dialects
is
unique

translating
kapiolani

translating
your

line
the
great
green
combers
break
strictly
according
to
east
polynesian
ushers
in
your
great
theme
will
i
trust
god
willing
become
a
household
classic
in
many
of
the
eastern
islands
such
as
rapa
and
manahiki
where
the
rarotongan
language
runs
current
as
a
sort
of
lingua
franca
or
sacred
esperanto
thanks
to
the
magnificent
translation
of
the
bible
by
the
great
missionary
john
williams
i
have
translated
the
poem
most
carefully
and
as
accurately
as
possible
into
the
peculiar
metre
and
cast
of
expression
which
an
eastern
polynesian
or
versifier
would
immediately
grasp
as
idiomatic
