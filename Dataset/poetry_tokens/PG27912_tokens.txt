gloucester
moors
a
mile
behind
is
gloucester
town
where
the
fishing
fleets
put
in
a
mile
ahead
the
land
dips
down
and
the
woods
and
farms
begin
here
where
the
moors
stretch
free
in
the
high
blue
afternoon
are
the
marching
sun
and
talking
sea
and
the
racing
winds
that
wheel
and
flee
on
the
flying
heels
of
june
is
purple
blue
blue
is
the
the
wild
geranium
holds
its
dew
long
in
the
boulder
shade
hangs
the
cup
from
the
huckleberry
boughs
in
barberry
bells
the
grey
moths
sup
or
where
the
lifts
high
up
sweet
bowls
for
their
carouse
over
the
shelf
of
the
sandy
cove
blossom
late
by
copse
and
cliff
the
swallows
rove
each
calling
to
his
mate
seaward
the
go
and
the
all
are
here
that
flash
was
a
vireo
and
yonder
flame
where
the
grow
was
a
scarlet
tanager
this
earth
is
not
the
steadfast
place
we
landsmen
build
upon
from
deep
to
deep
she
varies
pace
and
while
she
comes
is
gone
beneath
my
feet
i
feel
her
smooth
bulk
heave
and
dip
with
velvet
plunge
and
soft
upreel
she
swings
and
steadies
to
her
keel
like
a
gallant
gallant
ship
these
summer
clouds
she
sets
for
sail
the
sun
is
her
masthead
light
she
tows
the
moon
like
a
pinnace
frail
where
her
phosphor
wake
churns
bright
now
hid
now
looming
clear
on
the
face
of
the
dangerous
blue
the
star
fleets
tack
and
wheel
and
veer
but
on
but
on
does
the
old
earth
steer
as
if
her
port
she
knew
god
dear
god
does
she
know
her
port
though
she
goes
so
far
about
or
blind
astray
does
she
make
her
sport
to
brazen
and
chance
it
out
i
watched
when
her
captains
passed
she
were
better
captainless
men
in
the
cabin
before
the
mast
but
some
were
reckless
and
some
aghast
and
some
sat
gorged
at
mess
by
her
battened
hatch
i
leaned
and
caught
sounds
from
the
noisome
hold
cursing
and
sighing
of
souls
distraught
and
cries
too
sad
to
be
told
then
i
strove
to
go
down
and
see
but
they
said
thou
art
not
of
us
i
turned
to
those
on
the
deck
with
me
and
cried
give
help
but
they
said
let
be
our
ship
sails
faster
thus
is
purple
blue
blue
is
the
the
where
the
brook
comes
through
breeds
cresses
in
its
shade
to
be
out
of
the
moiling
street
with
its
swelter
and
its
sin
who
has
given
to
me
this
sweet
and
given
my
brother
dust
to
eat
and
when
will
his
wage
come
in
scattering
wide
or
blown
in
ranks
yellow
and
white
and
brown
boats
and
boats
from
the
fishing
banks
come
home
to
gloucester
town
there
is
cash
to
purse
and
spend
there
are
wives
to
be
embraced
hearts
to
borrow
and
hearts
to
lend
and
hearts
to
take
and
keep
to
the
end
o
little
sails
make
haste
but
thou
vast
outbound
ship
of
souls
what
harbor
town
for
thee
what
shapes
when
thy
arriving
tolls
shall
crowd
the
banks
to
see
shall
all
the
happy
shipmates
then
stand
singing
brotherly
or
shall
a
haggard
ruthless
few
warp
her
over
and
bring
her
to
while
the
many
broken
souls
of
men
fester
down
in
the
slaver
pen
and
nothing
to
say
or
do
good
friday
night
at
last
the
bird
that
sang
so
long
in
twilight
circles
hushed
his
song
above
the
ancient
square
the
stars
came
here
and
there
good
friday
night
some
hearts
were
bowed
but
some
amid
the
waiting
crowd
because
of
too
much
youth
felt
not
that
mystic
ruth
and
of
these
hearts
my
heart
was
one
nor
when
beneath
the
arch
of
stone
with
dirge
and
candle
flame
the
cross
of
passion
came
did
my
glad
spirit
feel
reproof
though
on
the
awful
tree
aloof
unspiritual
dead
drooped
the
ensanguined
head
to
one
who
stood
where
myrtles
made
a
little
space
of
deeper
shade
as
i
could
half
descry
a
stranger
even
as
i
i
said
these
youths
who
bear
along
the
symbols
of
their
saviour
wrong
the
spear
the
garment
torn
the
flaggel
and
the
thorn
why
do
they
make
this
mummery
would
not
a
brave
man
gladly
die
for
a
much
smaller
thing
than
to
be
christ
and
king
he
answered
nothing
and
i
turned
throned
in
its
hundred
candles
burned
the
jeweled
eidolon
of
her
who
bore
the
son
the
crowd
was
prostrate
still
i
felt
no
shame
until
the
stranger
knelt
then
not
to
kneel
almost
seemed
like
a
vulgar
boast
i
knelt
the
waxen
white
flowered
out
a
living
dimness
bright
dawned
the
dear
mortal
grace
of
my
own
mother
face
when
we
were
risen
up
the
street
was
vacant
all
the
air
hung
sweet
with
and
soon
the
sky
would
hold
the
moon
more
silently
than
friends
to
whom
much
silence
makes
amends
for
the
much
babble
vain
while
yet
their
lives
were
twain
we
walked
along
the
odorous
hill
the
light
was
little
yet
his
will
i
could
not
see
to
trace
upon
his
form
or
face
so
when
aloft
the
gold
moon
broke
i
cried
as
one
who
woke
he
turned
unto
my
cries
the
anguish
of
his
eyes
friend
master
i
cried
falteringly
thou
seest
the
thing
they
make
of
thee
oh
by
the
light
divine
my
mother
shares
with
thine
i
beg
that
i
may
lay
my
head
upon
thy
shoulder
and
be
fed
with
thoughts
of
brotherhood
so
through
the
odorous
wood
more
silently
than
friends
we
walked
at
the
first
meadow
bound
his
figure
sank
in
the
moon
broad
gold
for
the
start
leave
the
early
bells
at
chime
leave
the
kindled
hearth
to
blaze
leave
the
trellised
panes
where
children
linger
out
the
leave
the
forms
of
sons
and
fathers
trudging
through
the
misty
ways
leave
the
sounds
of
mothers
taking
up
their
sweet
laborious
days
pass
them
by
even
while
our
soul
yearns
to
them
with
keen
distress
unto
them
a
part
is
given
we
will
strive
to
see
the
whole
dear
shall
be
the
banquet
table
where
their
singing
spirits
press
dearer
be
our
sacred
hunger
and
our
pilgrim
loneliness
we
have
felt
the
ancient
swaying
of
the
earth
before
the
sun
on
the
darkened
marge
of
midnight
heard
sidereal
rivers
playing
rash
it
was
to
bathe
our
souls
there
but
we
plunged
and
all
was
done
that
is
lives
and
lives
behind
us
lo
our
journey
is
begun
careless
where
our
face
is
set
let
us
take
the
open
way
what
we
are
no
tongue
has
told
us
who
forget
soldiers
heedless
of
their
harry
pilgrim
people
gone
astray
we
have
heard
a
voice
cry
wander
that
was
all
we
heard
it
say
ask
no
more
is
much
is
much
down
the
road
the
calls
touched
with
change
in
the
wide
heavens
like
a
leaf
the
frost
winds
touch
flames
the
failing
moon
a
moment
ere
it
shrivels
white
and
falls
hid
aloft
a
wild
throat
holdeth
sweet
and
sweeter
intervals
leave
him
still
to
ease
in
song
half
his
little
heart
unrest
speech
is
his
but
we
may
journey
toward
the
life
for
which
we
long
god
who
gives
the
bird
its
anguish
maketh
nothing
manifest
but
upon
our
lifted
foreheads
pours
the
boon
of
endless
quest
an
ode
in
time
of
hesitation
after
seeing
at
boston
the
statue
of
robert
gould
shaw
killed
while
storming
fort
wagner
july
at
the
head
of
the
first
enlisted
negro
regiment
the
massachusetts
i
before
the
solemn
bronze
saint
gaudens
made
to
thrill
the
heedless
passer
heart
with
awe
and
set
here
in
the
city
talk
and
trade
to
the
good
memory
of
robert
shaw
this
bright
march
morn
i
stand
and
hear
the
distant
spring
come
up
the
land
knowing
that
what
i
hear
is
not
unheard
of
this
boy
soldier
and
his
negro
band
for
all
their
gaze
is
fixed
so
stern
ahead
for
all
the
fatal
rhythm
of
their
tread
the
land
they
died
to
save
from
death
and
shame
trembles
and
waits
hearing
the
spring
great
name
and
by
her
pangs
these
resolute
ghosts
are
stirred
ii
through
street
and
mall
the
tides
of
people
go
heedless
the
trees
upon
the
common
show
no
hint
of
green
but
to
my
listening
heart
the
still
earth
doth
impart
assurance
of
her
jubilant
emprise
and
it
is
clear
to
my
eyes
that
love
at
last
has
might
upon
the
skies
the
ice
is
runneled
on
the
little
pond
a
telltale
patter
drips
from
off
the
trees
the
air
is
touched
with
southland
spiceries
as
if
but
yesterday
it
tossed
the
frond
of
pendent
mosses
where
the
grow
beyond
virginia
and
the
carolines
or
had
its
will
among
the
fruits
and
vines
of
aromatic
isles
asleep
beyond
florida
and
the
gulf
of
mexico
iii
soon
shall
the
cape
ann
children
shout
in
glee
spying
the
arbutus
spring
dear
recluse
hill
lads
at
dawn
shall
hearken
the
wild
goose
go
honking
northward
over
tennessee
west
from
oswego
to
sault
and
on
to
where
the
pictured
rocks
are
hung
and
yonder
where
gigantic
willful
young
chicago
sitteth
at
the
northwest
gates
with
restless
violent
hands
and
casual
tongue
moulding
her
mighty
fates
the
lakes
shall
robe
them
in
ethereal
sheen
and
like
a
larger
sea
the
vital
green
of
springing
wheat
shall
vastly
be
outflung
over
dakota
and
the
prairie
states
by
desert
people
immemorial
on
arizonan
mesas
shall
be
done
dim
rites
unto
the
thunder
and
the
sun
nor
shall
the
primal
gods
lack
sacrifice
more
splendid
when
the
white
sierras
call
unto
the
rockies
straightway
to
arise
and
dance
before
the
unveiled
ark
of
the
year
sounding
their
windy
cedars
as
for
shawms
unrolling
rivers
clear
for
flutter
of
broad
phylacteries
while
shasta
signals
to
alaskan
seas
that
watch
old
sluggish
glaciers
downward
creep
to
fling
their
icebergs
thundering
from
the
steep
and
mariposa
through
the
purple
calms
gazes
at
far
hawaii
crowned
with
palms
where
east
and
west
are
met
a
rich
seal
on
the
ocean
bosom
set
to
say
that
east
and
west
are
twain
with
different
loss
and
gain
the
lord
hath
sundered
them
let
them
be
sundered
yet
iv
alas
what
sounds
are
these
that
come
sullenly
over
the
pacific
seas
sounds
of
ignoble
battle
striking
dumb
the
season
ecstasies
must
i
be
humble
then
now
when
my
heart
hath
need
of
pride
wild
love
falls
on
me
from
these
sculptured
men
by
loving
much
the
land
for
which
they
died
i
would
be
justified
my
spirit
was
away
on
pinions
wide
to
soothe
in
praise
of
her
its
passionate
mood
and
ease
it
of
its
ache
of
gratitude
too
sorely
heavy
is
the
debt
they
lay
on
me
and
the
companions
of
my
day
i
would
remember
now
my
country
goodliness
make
sweet
her
name
alas
what
shade
art
thou
of
sorrow
or
of
blame
liftest
the
lyric
leafage
from
her
brow
and
pointest
a
slow
finger
at
her
shame
v
lies
lies
it
can
not
be
the
wars
we
wage
are
noble
and
our
battles
still
are
won
by
justice
for
us
ere
we
lift
the
gage
we
have
not
sold
our
loftiest
heritage
the
proud
republic
hath
not
stooped
to
cheat
and
scramble
in
the
of
war
her
forehead
weareth
yet
its
solemn
star
here
is
her
witness
this
her
perfect
son
this
delicate
and
proud
new
england
soul
who
leads
despisèd
men
with
feet
up
the
large
ways
where
death
and
glory
meet
to
show
all
peoples
that
our
shame
is
done
that
once
more
we
are
clean
and
vi
crouched
in
the
sea
fog
on
the
moaning
sand
all
night
he
lay
speaking
some
simple
word
from
hour
to
hour
to
the
slow
minds
that
heard
holding
each
poor
life
gently
in
his
hand
and
breathing
on
the
base
rejected
clay
till
each
dark
face
shone
mystical
and
grand
against
the
breaking
day
and
lo
the
shard
the
potter
cast
away
was
grown
a
fiery
chalice
fulfilled
of
the
divine
great
wine
of
battle
wrath
by
god
stirred
then
upward
where
the
shadowy
bastion
loomed
huge
on
the
mountain
in
the
wet
sea
light
whence
now
and
now
infernal
flowerage
bloomed
bloomed
burst
and
scattered
down
its
deadly
seed
they
swept
and
died
like
freemen
on
the
height
like
freemen
and
like
men
of
noble
breed
and
when
the
battle
fell
away
at
night
by
hasty
and
contemptuous
hands
were
thrust
obscurely
in
a
common
grave
with
him
the
keeper
of
their
love
and
trust
now
limb
doth
mingle
with
dissolvèd
limb
in
nature
busy
old
democracy
to
flush
the
mountain
laurel
when
she
blows
sweet
by
the
southern
sea
and
heart
with
crumbled
heart
climbs
in
the
rose
the
untaught
hearts
with
the
high
heart
that
knew
this
mountain
fortress
for
no
earthly
hold
of
temporal
quarrel
but
the
bastion
old
of
spiritual
wrong
built
by
an
unjust
nation
sheer
and
strong
expugnable
but
by
a
nation
rue
and
bowing
down
before
that
equal
shrine
by
all
men
held
divine
whereof
his
band
and
he
were
the
most
holy
sign
vii
o
bitter
bitter
shade
wilt
thou
not
put
the
scorn
and
instant
tragic
question
from
thine
eyes
do
thy
dark
brows
yet
crave
that
swift
and
angry
stave
unmeet
for
this
desirous
morn
that
i
have
striven
striven
to
evade
gazing
on
him
must
i
not
deem
they
err
whose
careless
lips
in
street
and
shop
aver
as
common
tidings
deeds
to
make
his
cheek
flush
from
the
bronze
and
his
dead
throat
to
speak
surely
some
elder
singer
would
arise
whose
harp
hath
leave
to
threaten
and
to
mourn
above
this
people
when
they
go
astray
is
whitman
the
strong
spirit
overworn
has
whittier
put
his
yearning
wrath
away
i
will
not
and
i
dare
not
yet
believe
though
furtively
the
sunlight
seems
to
grieve
and
the
breeze
out
of
the
gladdening
west
is
sinister
with
sounds
of
nameless
battle
overseas
though
when
we
turn
and
question
in
suspense
if
these
things
be
indeed
after
these
ways
and
what
things
are
to
follow
after
these
our
fluent
men
of
place
and
consequence
fumble
and
fill
their
mouths
with
hollow
phrase
or
for
the
of
deep
arguments
intone
their
dull
commercial
liturgies
i
dare
not
yet
believe
my
ears
are
shut
i
will
not
hear
the
thin
satiric
praise
and
muffled
laughter
of
our
enemies
bidding
us
never
sheathe
our
valiant
sword
till
we
have
changed
our
birthright
for
a
gourd
of
wild
pulse
stolen
from
a
barbarian
hut
showing
how
wise
it
is
to
cast
away
the

i
met
a
sacred
elephant
upon
his
back
a
huge
pagoda
towered
full
of
brass
gods
and
food
of
sacrifice
upon
his
forehead
sat
a
golden
throne
the
massy
metal
twisted
into
shapes
grotesque
antediluvian
such
as
move
in
myth
or
have
their
broken
images
sealed
in
the
stony
middle
of
the
hills
a
peacock
spread
his
thousand
dyes
to
screen
the
yellow
sunlight
from
the
head
of
one
who
sat
upon
the
throne
clad
stiff
with
gems
heirlooms
of
dynasties
of
buried
kings
himself
the
likeness
of
a
buried
king
with
frozen
gesture
and
unfocused
eyes
the
trappings
of
the
beast
were
with
broideries
and
flying
things
and
dwarfed
nodosities
of
pine
mixed
with
old
alphabets
and
faded
lore
fallen
from
ecstatic
mouths
before
the
flood
or
gathered
by
the
daughters
when
they
walked
eastward
in
eden
with
the
sons
of
god
whom
love
and
the
deep
moon
made
garrulous
between
the
carven
tusks
his
trunk
hung
dead
blind
as
the
eyes
of
pearl
in
buddha
brow
his
beaded
eyes
stared
thwart
upon
the
road
and
feebler
than
the
doting
knees
of
eld
his
joints
of
size
to
swing
the
builder
crane
across
the
of
the
anakim
made
vain
and
shaken
haste
good
need
was
his
to
hasten
panting
foaming
on
the
slot
came
many
brutes
of
prey
their
several
hates
laid
by
until
the
sharing
of
the
spoil
just
as
they
gathered
stomach
for
the
leap
the
sun
was
darkened
and
wings
beat
downward
on
the
from
the
sea
a
wheel
of
shadow
sped
along
the
fields
and
the
dreaming
cities
suddenly
my
heart
misgave
me
and
i
cried
aloud
alas
what
dost
thou
here
what
dost
here
the
great
beasts
and
the
little
halted
sharp
eyed
the
grand
circler
doubting
his
intent
straightway
the
wind
flawed
and
he
came
about
stooping
to
take
the
vanward
of
the
pack
then
turned
between
the
chasers
and
the
chased
crying
a
word
i
could
not
understand
but
with
eyes
somewhat
askance
they
settled
to
the
slot
and
disappeared
on
a
soldier
fallen
in
the
philippines
streets
of
the
roaring
town
hush
for
him
hush
be
still
he
comes
who
was
stricken
down
doing
the
word
of
our
will
hush
let
him
have
his
state
give
him
his
soldier
crown
the
grists
of
trade
can
wait
their
grinding
at
the
mill
but
he
can
not
wait
for
his
honor
now
the
trumpet
has
been
blown
wreathe
pride
now
for
his
granite
brow
lay
love
on
his
breast
of
stone
toll
let
the
great
bells
toll
till
the
clashing
air
is
dim
did
we
wrong
this
parted
soul
we
will
make
it
up
to
him
toll
let
him
never
guess
what
work
we
set
him
to
laurel
laurel
yes
he
did
what
we
bade
him
do
praise
and
never
a
whispered
hint
but
the
fight
he
fought
was
good
never
a
word
that
the
blood
on
his
sword
was
his
country
own
a
flag
for
the
soldier
bier
who
dies
that
his
land
may
live

not
nor

that

not
from
the
tomb
the
evil
days
draw
near
when
the
nation
robed
in
gloom
with
its
faithless
past
shall
strive
let
him
never
dream
that
his
bullet
scream
went
wide
of
its
island
mark
home
to
the
heart
of
his
darling
land
where
she
stumbled
and
sinned
in
the
dark
until
the
troubling
of
the
waters
two
hours
two
hours
god
give
me
strength
for
it
he
who
has
given
so
much
strength
to
me
and
nothing
to
my
child
must
give
what
more
i
need
to
try
and
save
my
child
and
get
for
him
the
life
i
owe
to
him
to
think
that
i
may
get
it
for
him
now
before
he
knows
how
much
he
might
have
missed
that
other
boys
have
got
the
bitterest
thought
of
all
that
plagued
me
when
he
came
was
this
how
some
day
he
would
see
the
difference
and
drag
himself
to
me
with
puzzled
eyes
to
ask
me
why
it
was
he
would
have
been
cruel
enough
to
do
it
knowing
not
that
was
the
question
my
rebellious
heart
cried
over
and
over
one
whole
year
to
god
and
got
no
answer
and
no
help
at
all
if
he
had
asked
me
what
could
i
have
said
what
single
word
could
i
have
found
to
say
to
hide
me
from
his
searching
puzzled
gaze
some
coward
thing
at
best
never
the
truth
the
truth
i
never
could
have
told
him
no
i
never
could
have
said
god
gave
you
me
to
fashion
you
a
body
right
and
strong
with
sturdy
little
limbs
and
chest
and
neck
for
fun
and
fighting
with
your
little
mates
great
feats
and
voyages
in
the
breathless
world
of
he
gave
you
me
for
this
and
i
was
such
a
bungler
that
is
all
o
the
old
lie
that
thought
was
not
the
worst
i
never
have
been
truthful
with
myself
for
by
the
door
where
lurked
one
ghostly
thought
i
stood
with
crazy
hands
to
thrust
it
back
if
it
should
dare
to
peep
and
whisper
out
unbearable
things
about
me
hearing
which
the
women
passing
in
the
streets
would
turn
to
pity
me
and
scold
me
with
their
eyes
who
was
so
bad
a
mother
and
so
slow
to
learn
to
help
god
do
his
wonder
in
her
that
she
o
my
sweet
baby
it
was
not
the
fear
that
you
would
see
the
difference
between
you
and
the
other
boys
and
girls
no
no
it
was
the
dimmer
wilder
fear
that
you
might
never
see
it
never
look
out
of
your
tiny
of
mind
but
sit
your
life
through
quiet
in
the
dark
smiling
and
nodding
at
what
was
not
there
a
foolish
fear
god
could
not
punish
so
yet
until
yesterday
i
thought
he
would
my
soul
was
always
cowering
at
the
blow
i
saw
suspended
ready
to
be
dealt
the
moment
that
i
showed
my
fear
too
much
therefore
i
hid
it
from
him
all
i
could
and
only
stole
a
shaking
glance
at
it
sometimes
in
the
dead
minutes
before
dawn
when
he
forgets
to
watch
till
yesterday
for
yesterday
was
wonderful
and
strange
from
the
beginning
when
i
wakened
first
and
looked
out
at
the
window
the
last
snow
was
gone
from
earth
about
the
hung
a
faint
mist
of
bloom
small
sudden
green
had
run
and
spread
and
rippled
everywhere
over
the
fields
and
in
the
level
sun
walked
something
like
a
presence
and
a
power
uttering
hopes
and
to
all
the
world
but
chiefly
unto
me
it
walked
before
me
when
i
went
to
work
and
all
day
long
the
noises
of
the
mill
were
spun
upon
a
core
of
golden
sound
words
and
interrupted
songs
of
blessed
promise
meant
for
all
the
world
but
most
for
me
because
i
suffered
most
the
shooting
spindles
the
wheels
the
rocking
webs
seemed
toiling
to
some
end
beneficent
and
human
known
to
them
and
duly
brought
to
pass
in
power
and
love
the
faces
of
the
girls
and
men
at
work
met
mine
with
intense
greeting
veiled
at
once
as
if
they
knew
a
secret
they
must
keep
for
fear
the
joy
would
harm
me
if
they
told
before
some
inkling
filtered
to
my
mind
in
roundabout
ways
when
the
day
work
was
done
there
lay
a
special
silence
on
the
fields
and
as
i
passed
the
bushes
and
the
trees
the
very
ruts
and
puddles
of
the
road
spoke
to
each
other
saying
it
was
she
the
happy
woman
the
elected
one
the
vessel
of
strange
mercy
and
the
sign
of
many
loving
wonders
done
in
heaven
to
help
the
piteous
earth
at
last
i
stopped
and
looked
about
me
in
sheer
wonderment
what
did
it
mean
what
did
they
want
with
me
what
was
the
matter
with
the
evening
now
that
it
was
just
as
bound
to
make
me
glad
as
morning
and
the
day
had
been
me
who
had
quite
forgot
what
gladness
was
who
had
no
right
to
anything
but
toil
and
food
and
sleep
for
strength
to
toil
again
and
that
fierce
frightened
anguish
of
my
love
for
the
poor
little
spirit
i
had
wronged
with
life
that
was
no
life
what
had
befallen
since
yesterday
no
need
to
stop
and
ask
back
there
in
the
dark
places
of
my
mind
where
i
had
thrust
it
fearing
to
believe
an
unbelievable
mercy
shone
the
news
told
by
the
village
neighbors
coming
home
last
night
from
the
great
city
of
a
man
arisen
like
the
first
evangelists
with
power
to
heal
the
bodies
of
the
sick
in
testimony
of
his
master
christ
who
heals
the
soul
when
it
is
sick
with
sin
could
such
a
thing
be
true
in
these
hard
days
was
help
still
sent
in
such
a
way
as
that
no
no
i
did
not
dare
to
think
of
it
feeling
what
weakness
and
despair
would
come
after
the
crazy
hope
broke
under
me
i
turned
and
started
homeward
faster
now
but
never
fast
enough
to
leave
behind
the
voices
and
the
troubled
happiness
that
still
kept
mounting
mounting
like
a
sea
and
singing
like
a
rush
of
wings
far
down
the
road
a
yellow
spot
of
light
shone
from
my
cottage
window
rayless
yet
where
the
last
sunset
crimson
caught
the
panes
alice
had
lit
the
lamp
before
she
went
her
day
of
pity
and
unmirthful
play
was
over
and
her
young
heart
free
to
live
until
brought
her
again
and
made
her
feel
how
dark
and
still
that
life
could
be
to
others
which
to
her
was
full
of
dreams
that
beckoned
reaching
hands
and
thrilling
invitations
young
girls
hear
my
boy
was
sleeping
little
mind
and
frame
more
tired
just
lying
there
awake
two
hours
than
with
a
whole
day
romp
he
should
have
been
he
would
not
know
his
mother
had
come
home
but
after
supper
i
would
sit
awhile
beside
his
bed
and
let
my
heart
have
time
for
that
worst
love
that
stabs
and
breaks
and
kills
this
i
thought
over
to
myself
by
rote
and
habit
but
i
could
not
feel
my
thoughts
for
still
that
dim
unmeaning
happiness
kept
mounting
mounting
round
me
like
a
sea
and
singing
inward
like
a
wind
of
wings
before
i
lifted
up
the
latch
i
knew
i
felt
no
fear
the
one
who
waited
there
in
the
low
lamplight
by
the
bed
had
come
because
i
was
his
sister
and
in
need
my
word
had
got
to
him
somehow
at
last
and
he
had
come
to
help
me
or
to
tell
where
help
was
to
be
found
it
was
not
strange
strange
only
he
had
stayed
away
so
long
but
that
should
be
forgotten
he
was
here
i
pushed
the
door
wide
open
and
looked
in
he
had
been
kneeling
by
the
bed
and
now
kissed
my
boy
upon
the
lips
then
turned
and
smiled
and
pointed
with
his
hand
i
must
have
fallen
on
the
threshold
stone
for
i
remember
that
i
felt
not
saw
the
resurrection
glory
and
the
peace
shed
from
his
face
and
raiment
as
he
went
out
by
the
door
into
the
evening
street
but
when
i
looked
the
place
about
the
bed
was
yet
all
bathed
in
light
and
in
the
midst
my
boy
lay
changed
no
longer
clothed
upon
with
scraps
and
shreds
of
life
but
like
the
child
of
some
most
fortunate
mother
in
a
breath
the
image
faded
there
he
lay
again
the
same
as
always
and
the
light
was
gone
i
sank
with
moans
and
cries
beside
the
bed
the
cruelty
o
christ
the
cruelty
to
come
at
last
and
then
to
go
like
that
leaving
the
darkness
deeper
than
before
then
though
i
heard
no
sound
i
grew
aware
of
some
one
standing
by
the
open
door
among
the
dry
vines
rustling
in
the
porch
my
heart
laughed
suddenly
he
had
come
back
he
had
come
back
to
make
the
vision
true
he
had
not
meant
to
mock
me
god
was
god
and
christ
was
christ
there
was
no
falsehood
there
i
heard
a
quiet
footstep
cross
the
room
and
felt
a
hand
laid
gently
on
my
hair
a
human
hand
worn
hard
by
daily
toil
heavy
with
struggle
after
bread
alice
father
the
kind
homely
voice
had
in
it
such
strange
music
that
i
dreamed
perhaps
it
was
the
other
speaking
in
him
because
his
own
bright
form
had
made
me
swoon
with
its
too
much
of
glory
what
he
brought
was
news
as
good
as
ever
heavenly
lips
had
the
dear
right
to
utter
he
had
been
all
day
among
the
crowds
of
curious
folk
from
the
great
city
and
the
gathered
to
watch
the
healer
do
his
work
of
mercy
on
the
sick
and
halt
and
blind
and
with
his
very
eyes
had
seen
such
things
as
awestruck
men
had
witnessed
long
ago
in
galilee
and
writ
of
in
the
book
morning
he
would
take
me
there
if
i
had
strength
and
courage
to
believe
it
might
be
there
was
hope
he
could
not
say
but
knew
what
he
had
seen
when
he
was
gone
i
lay
for
hours
letting
the
solemn
waves
thundering
joy
go
over
and
over
me
just
before
midnight
baby
fretted
woke
he
never
yet
has
slept
a
whole
night
through
without
his
food
and
petting
as
i
sat
feeding
and
petting
him
and
singing
soft
i
felt
a
jealousy
begin
to
ache
and
worry
at
my
heartstrings
hushing
down
the
gladness
jealousy
of
what
or
whom
i
hardly
knew
or
could
not
put
in
words
at
least
it
seemed
too
foolish
and
too
wrong
when
said
and
so
i
shut
the
thought
away
only
next
minute
it
came
stealing
back
after
the
change
would
my
boy
be
the
same
as
this
one
would
he
be
my
boy
at
all
and
not
another
his
who
gave
the
life
i
could
not
give
or
did
not
anyhow
how
could
i
look
in
his
new
eyes
to
claim
the
whole
of
him
the
body
and
the
breath
when
some
one
not
his
mother
a
strange
man
had
clothed
him
in
that
beauty
of
the
flesh
perhaps
for
who
could
know
perhaps
by
some
hateful
disfiguring
miracle
had
even
transformed
his
spirit
to
a
better
one
better
but
not
the
same
i
prayed
for
him
down
out
of
heaven
through
the
sleepless
nights
the
best
that
god
would
send
to
such
as
me
i
tried
to
strangle
back
the
wicked
pain
fancied
him
changed
and
tried
to
love
him
so
no
use
it
was
another
not
my
child
not
my
frail
broken
priceless
little
one
my
cup
of
anguish
and
my
trembling
star
hung
small
and
sad
and
sweet
above
the
earth
so
sure
to
fall
but
for
my
cherishing
when
he
had
dropped
asleep
again
i
rose
and
wrestled
with
the
sinful
selfishness
the
dark
injustice
the
unnatural
pain
fevered
at
last
with
pacing
to
and
fro
i
raised
the
bedroom
window
and
leaned
out
the
white
moon
low
behind
the
sycamores
silvered
the
silent
country
not
a
voice
of
all
the
myriads
summer
moves
to
sing
had
yet
awakened
in
the
level
moon
walked
that
same
presence
i
had
heard
at
dawn
uttering
hopes
and
but
now
dispirited
and
reticent
it
walked
the
moonlight
like
a
homeless
thing
o
how
to
cleanse
me
of
the
cowardice
how
to
be
just
was
i
a
mother
then
a
mother
and
not
love
her
child
as
well
as
her
own
covetous
and
morbid
love
was
it
for
this
the
comforter
had
come
smiling
at
me
and
pointing
with
his
hand
what
had
he
meant
to
have
me
think
or
do
smiling
and
pointing
all
at
once
i
saw
a
way
to
save
my
darling
from
myself
and
make
atonement
for
my
grudging
love
under
the
sycamores
and
up
the
hill
and
down
across
the
river
the
wet
road
went
stretching
cityward
silvered
in
the
moon
i
who
had
shrunk
from
sacrifice
even
i
who
had
refused
god
blessing
for
my
boy
would
take
him
in
my
arms
and
carry
him
up
to
the
altar
of
the
miracle
i
would
not
wait
for
daylight
nor
the
help
of
any
human
friendship
i
alone
through
the
still
miles
of
country
i
alone
only
my
arms
to
shield
him
and
my
feet
to
bear
him
he
should
have
no
one
to
thank
but
me
for
that
i
knew
the
way
was
long
but
knew
strength
would
be
given
so
i
came
soon
the
stars
failed
the
late
moon
faded
too
i
think
my
heart
had
sucked
their
beams
from
them
to
build
more
blue
amid
the
murky
night
its
own
miraculous
day
from
creeks
and
fields
the
fog
climbed
slowly
blotted
out
the
road
and
hid
the
signposts
telling
of
the
town
after
a
while
rain
fell
with
sleet
and
snow
what
did
i
care
baby
was
snug
and
dry
some
day
when
i
was
telling
him
of
this
he
would
but
hug
me
closer
hearing
how
the
night
conspired
against
us
better
hard
than
easy
then
i
almost
felt
regret
my
body
was
so
capable
and
strong
to
do
its
errand
honeyed
drop
by
drop
the
ghostly
jealousy
loosening
at
my
breast
distilled
into
a
dew
of
quiet
tears
and
fell
with
splash
of
music
in
the
wells
and
on
the
hidden
rivers
of
my
soul
the
hardest
part
was
coming
through
the
town
the
country
even
when
it
hindered
most
seemed
conscious
of
the
thing
i
went
to
find
the
rocks
and
bushes
looming
through
the
mist
questioned
and
acquiesced
and
understood
the
trees
and
streams
believed
the
wind
and
rain
even
they
for
all
their
temper
had
some
words
of
faith
and
comfort
but
the
glaring
streets
the
dizzy
traffic
the
piled
merchandise
the
giant
buildings
swarming
with
fierce
life
cared
nothing
for
me
they
had
never
heard
of
me
nor
of
my
business
when
i
asked
my
way
a
shade
of
pity
or
contempt
showed
through
men
kindness
for
they
all
were
kind
daunted
and
chilled
and
very
sick
at
heart
i
walked
the
endless
pavements
but
at
last
the
streets
grew
quieter
the
houses
seemed
as
if
they
might
be
homes
where
people
lived
then
came
the
factories
and
cottages
and
all
was
well
again
much
more
than
well
for
many
sick
and
broken
went
my
way
alone
or
helped
along
by
loving
hands
and
from
a
thousand
eyes
the
famished
hope
looked
out
at
mine
wild
patient
querulous
but
always
hope
and
hope
a
thousand
tongues
speaking
one
word
in
many
languages
in
two
hours
he
will
come
they
say
will
stand
there
on
the
steps
above
the
waiting
crowd
and
touch
with
healing
hands
whoever
asks
believingly
in
spirit
and
in
truth
can
such
a
mercy
be
in
these
hard
days
is
help
still
sent
in
such
a
way
as
that
christ
i
believe
pity
my
unbelief
jetsam
i
wonder
can
this
be
the
world
it
was
at
sunset
i
remember
the
sky
fell
green
as
pale
meadows
at
the
long
but
overhead
the
hugged
the
roofs
as
if
to
shut
the
city
from
god
eyes
till
dawn
should
quench
the
laughter
and
the
lights
beneath
the
gas
flare
stolid
faces
passed
too
dull
for
sin
old
loosened
lips
set
hard
to
drain
the
stale
lees
from
the
cup
of
sense
or
if
a
young
face
yearned
from
out
the
mist
made
by
its
own
bright
hair
the
eyes
were
wan
with
desolate
of
the
end
my
life
lay
waste
about
me
as
i
walked
from
the
gross
dark
of
unfrequented
streets
the
face
of
my
own
youth
peered
forth
at
me
struck
white
with
pity
at
the
thing
i
was
and
globed
in
ghostly
fire
with
lifted
face
went
one
who
sang
lost
verses
from
my
youth
gold
canticle
out
of
the
void
dark
came
my
face
and
hers
one
vivid
moment
then
the
street
was
there
bloat
shapes
and
mean
eyes
blotted
the
sear
dusk
and
in
the
curtained
window
of
a
house
whence
sin
reeked
on
the
night
a
shameful
head
was
silhouetted
black
as
satan
face
against
eternal
fires
i
stumbled
on
down
the
dark
slope
that
reaches
riverward
stretching
blind
hands
to
find
the
throat
of
god
and
crush
him
in
his
lies
the
river
lay
coiled
in
its
factory
filth
and
few
lean
trees
all
was
too
hateful
i
could
not
die
there
i
whom
the
spring
had
strained
unto
her
breast
whose
lips
had
felt
the
wet
vague
lips
of
dawn
so
under
the
thin
willows
leprous
shade
and
through
the
tangled
ranks
of
riverweed
i
pushed
till
lo
god
heard
me
i
came
forth
where
the
shoreless
hush
of
region
light
through
a
new
world
undreamed
of
undesired
beyond
imagining
of
man
weary
heart
far
to
the
white
marge
of
the
wondering
sea
this
still
plain
widens
and
this
moon
rains
down
insufferable
ecstasy
of
peace
my
heart
is
man
heart
strong
to
bear
this
unspeakable
affliction
of
mute
love
that
crazes
lesser
things
the
rocks
and
clods
dissemble
feign
a
busy
intercourse
the
bushes
deal
in
shadowy
subterfuge
lurk
dull
dart
spiteful
out
make
heartless
signs
utter
awestricken
purpose
of
no
sense
but
i
walk
quiet
crush
aside
the
hands
stretched
furtively
to
drag
me
madmen
ways
i
know
the
thing
they
suffer
and
the
tricks
they
must
be
at
to
help
themselves
endure
i
would
not
be
too
boastful
i
am
weak
too
weak
to
put
aside
the
utter
ache
of
this
lone
splendor
long
enough
to
see
whether
the
moon
is
still
her
white
strange
self
or
something
whiter
stranger
even
the
face
which
by
the
changed
face
of
my
risen
youth
sang
globed
in
fire
her
golden
canticle
i
dare
not
look
again
another
gaze
might
drive
me
to
the
wavering
coppice
there
where
madness
brushed
me
the
wild
laugh
of
naked
nature
crashed
across
my
blood
so
rank
it
was
with
earthy
presences
in
goatish
dance
young
witches
eyes
slanting
deep
invitation
whinnying
calls
ambiguous
shocks
and
whirlwinds
of
wild
mirth
they
had
undone
me
in
the
darkness
there
but
that
within
me
smiting
through
my
lids
lowered
to
shut
in
the
thick
whirl
of
sense
the
dumb
light
ached
and
rummaged
and
with
out
the
soaring
splendor
summoned
me
aloud
to
leave
the
low
dank
thickets
of
the
flesh
where
man
meets
beast
and
makes
his
lair
with
him
for
spirit
reaches
of
the
strenuous
vast
where
stalwart
stars
reap
grain
to
make
the
bread
god
breaketh
at
his
tables
and
is
glad
i
came
out
in
the
moonlight
cleansed
and
strong
and
gazed
up
at
the
lyric
face
to
see
all
sweetness
tasted
of
in
earthen
cups
ere
it
be
dashed
and
spilled
all
radiance
flung
beyond
experience
every
benison
dream
treasured
and
mystically
crescent
there
o
who
will
shield
me
from
her
who
will
place
a
veil
between
me
and
the
fierce
of
her
inexorable
benedicite
see
i
have
loved
her
well
and
been
with
her
through
tragic
twilights
when
the
stricken
sea
groveled
with
fear
or
when
she
made
her
throne
in
imminent
cities
built
of
gorgeous
winds
and
paved
with
lightnings
or
when
the
sobering
stars
would
lead
her
home
wealth
of
plundered
may
along
the
violet
slopes
of
evensong
of
all
the
sights
that
starred
the
dreamy
year
for
me
one
sight
stood
peerless
and
apart
bright
rivers
tacit
low
hills
prone
and
dumb
forests
that
hushed
their
tiniest
voice
to
hear
skies
for
the
unutterable
advent
robed
in
purple
like
the
opening
iris
buds
and
by
some
lone
expectant
pool
one
tree
whose
gray
boughs
shivered
with
excess
of
awe
as
with
preluding
gush
of
amber
light
and
herald
trumpets
softly
lifted
through
across
the
palpitant
horizon
marge
came
the
singing
moon
out
of
her
changing
lights
i
wove
my
youth
a
place
to
dwell
in
sweet
and
spiritual
and
all
the
bitter
years
of
my
exile
my
heart
has
called
afar
off
unto
her
lo
after
many
days
love
finds
its
own
the
futile
adorations
the
waste
tears
the
hymns
that
fluttered
low
in
the
false
dawn
she
has
uptreasured
as
a
lover
gifts
they
are
the
mystic
garment
that
she
wears
against
the
bridal
and
the
crocus
flowers
she
twined
her
brow
with
at
the
going
forth
they
are
the
burden
of
the
song
she
made
in
coming
through
the
quiet
fields
of
space
and
breathe
between
her
lips
calling
me
out
along
the
flowering
road
which
summers
through
the
dimness
of
the
sea
hark
where
the
deep
feels
round
its
thousand
shores
to
find
remembered
respite
and
far
drawn
through
shelves
and
crannies
of
the
coast
the
myriad
silence
yearns
to
myriad
speech
o
sea
that
yearns
a
day
shall
thy
tongues
be
so
eloquent
and
heart
shall
all
thy
tongues
be
dumb
to
speak
thy
longing
say
i
hold
life
as
a
broken
jewel
in
my
hand
and
fain
would
buy
a
little
love
with
it
for
comfort
say
i
fain
would
make
it
shine
once
in
remembering
eyes
ere
it
be
dust
were
life
not
worthy
spent
then
what
of
this
when
all
my
spirit
hungers
to
repay
the
beauty
that
has
drenched
my
soul
with
peace
once
at
a
simple
turning
of
the
way
i
met
god
walking
and
although
the
dawn
was
large
behind
him
and
the
morning
stars
circled
and
sang
about
his
face
as
birds
about
the
fieldward
morning
cottager
my
coward
heart
said
faintly
let
us
haste
day
grows
and
it
is
far
to
once
where
i
lay
in
darkness
after
fight
sore
smitten
thrilled
a
little
thread
of
song
searching
and
searching
at
my
muffled
sense
until
it
shook
sweet
pangs
through
all
my
blood
and
i
beheld
one
globed
in
ghostly
fire
singing
her
golden
canticle
and
her
mouth
sang
the
hosts
of
hate
roll
past
a
dance
of
dust
motes
in
the
sliding
sun
love
battle
comes
on
the
wide
wings
of
storm
from
east
to
west
one
legion
wilt
thou
strive
then
since
the
splendor
of
her
gaze
was
heavy
on
me
with
yearning
and
with
scorn
my
sick
heart
muttered
yea
the
little
strife
yet
see
the
grievous
wounds
i
fain
would
sleep
o
heart
shalt
thou
not
once
be
strong
to
go
where
all
sweet
throats
are
calling
once
be
brave
to
slake
with
deed
thy
dumbness
let
us
go
the
path
her
singing
face
looms
low
to
point
pendulous
blanched
with
longing
shedding
flame
of
silver
on
the
brown
grope
of
the
flood
for
all
my
spirit
soilure
is
put
by
and
all
my
body
soilure
lacking
now
but
the
last
lustral
sacrament
of
death
to
make
me
clean
for
those
eyes
that
question
yonder
whether
all
be
well
and
pause
a
little
ere
they
dare
rejoice
question
and
be
thou
answered
passionate
face
for
i
am
worthy
worthy
now
at
last
after
so
long
unworth
strong
now
at
last
to
give
myself
to
beauty
and
be
saved
now
being
man
to
give
myself
to
thee
as
once
the
tumult
of
my
boyish
heart
companioned
thee
with
rapture
through
the
world
forth
from
a
land
whereof
no
poet
lip
made
mention
how
the
leas
were
into
a
land
god
eyes
had
looked
not
on
to
love
the
tender
bloom
upon
the
hills
when
the
fishers
come
at
dawn
upon
that
shell
of
me
the
sea
has
tossed
to
land
as
fit
for
earth
to
use
again
men
meeting
at
the
shops
and

streets

speak
a
word
of

glossing
with
altered
accent
dubious
sweep
of

their
virile
just
contempt
for

who
failed

ere
a

its

the
little
sand
grows
musical
of
hope
beneath
my
feet
the
waves
that
leap
to
meet
my
swimming
breast
gossip
sweet
secrets
of
the
way
and
when

throbs
of
the

with
me

blurs
round

to

low

through
his
might
men
work
their
wills
they
have
boweled
out
the
hills
for
food
to
keep
him
toiling
in
the
cages
they
have
wrought
and
they
fling
him
hour
by
hour
limbs
of
men
to
give
him
power
brains
of
men
to
give
him
cunning
and
for
dainties
to
devour
children
souls
the
little
worth
hearts
of
women
cheaply
bought
he
takes
them
and
he
breaks
them
but
he
gives
them
scanty
thought
for
about
the
noisy
land
roaring
quivering
his
hand
his
thoughts
brood
fierce
and
sullen
or
laugh
in
lust
of
pride
the
stubborn
things
that
he
breaks
to
dust
and
brings
to
be
some
he
mightily
establishes
some
flings
down
utterly
there
is
thunder
in
his
stride
nothing
ancient
can
abide
when
he
hales
the
hills
together
and
bridles
up
the
tide
quietude
and
loveliness
holy
sights
that
heal
and
bless
they
are
scattered
and
abolished
where
his
iron
hoof
is
set
when
he
splashes
through
the
brae
silver
streams
are
choked
with
clay
when
he
snorts
the
bright
cliffs
crumble
and
the
woods
go
down
like
hay
he
lairs
in
pleasant
cities
and
the
haggard
people
fret
squalid
their
riches
and
desolate
they
who
caught
and
bound
him
tight
laughed
exultant
at
his
might
saying
now
behold
the
good
time
comes
for
the
weariest
and
the
least
we
will
use
this
lusty
knave
no
more
need
for
men
to
slave
we
may
rise
and
look
about
us
and
have
knowledge
ere
the
grave
but
the
brute
said
in
his
breast
till
the
mills
i
grind
have
ceased
the
riches
shall
be
dust
of
dust
dry
ashes
be
the
feast
on

favors
i
will
strew
i
will
stuff
their
maw
with
overplus
until
their
spirit
dies
from
the
patient
and
the
low
i
will
take
the
joys
they
know
they
shall
hunger
after
vanities
and
still
go
madness
shall
be
on
the
people
ghastly
jealousies
arise
brother
blood
shall
cry
on
brother
up
the
dead
and
empty

i
will
burn

hack
till
the

suffer
lack
god
shall
feel
a
pleasure
fail
him
crying
to
his
cherubim
hath
flung
yon
there
where
my
world
went
green
and
fair
i
shall
laugh
and
hug
me
hearing
how
his
sentinels
declare
t
is
the
brute
they
chained
to
labor
he
has
made
the
bright
earth
dim
store
of
wares
and
pelf
a
plenty
but
they
got
no
good
of
him
so
he
plotted
in
his
rage
so
he
deals
it
age
by
age
but
even
as
he
roared
his
curse
a
still
small
voice
befell
lo
a
still
and
pleasant
voice
bade
them
none
the
less
rejoice
for
the
brute
must
bring
the
good
time
on
he
has
no
other
choice
he
may
struggle
sweat
and
yell
but
he
knows
exceeding
well
he
must
work
them
out
salvation
ere
they
send
him
back
to
hell
all
the
desert
that
he
made
he
must
treble
bless
with
shade
in
primal
wastes
set
precious
seed
of
rapture
and
of
pain
all
the
strongholds
that
he
built
for
the
powers
of
greed
and
guilt
he
must
strew
their
bastions
down
the
sea
and
choke
their
towers
with
silt
he
must
make
the
temples
clean
for
the
gods
to
come
again
and
lift
the
lordly
cities
under
skies
without
a
stain
in
a
very
cunning
tether
he
must
lead
the
tyrant
weather
he
must
loose
the
curse
of
adam
from
the
worn
neck
of
the
race
he
must
cast
out
hate
and
fear
dry
away
each
fruitless
tear
and
make
the
fruitful
tears
to
gush
from
the
deep
heart
and
clear
he
must
give
each
man
his
portion
each
his
pride
and
worthy
place
he
must
batter
down
the
arrogant
and
lift
the
weary
face
on
each
vile
mouth
set
purity
on
each
low
forehead
grace
then
perhaps
at
the
last
day
they
will
whistle
him
away
lay
a
hand
upon
his
muzzle
in
the
face
of
god
and
say
honor
lord
the
thing
we
tamed
let
him
not
be
scourged
or
blamed
even
through
his
wrath
and
fierceness
was
thy
fierce
wroth
world
reclaimed
honor
thou
thy
servants
servant
let
thy
justice
now
be
shown
then
the
lord
will
heed
their
saying
and
the
brute
come
to
his
own
the
lion
and
the
eagle
by
the
armpost
of
the
throne
the
menagerie
thank
god
my
brain
is
not
inclined
to
cut
such
capers
every
day
i
just
about
mellow
but
then
there
goes
the
shut
rain
in
the
wind
i
thought
so
every
snout
was
twitching
when
the
keeper
turned
me
out
that
screaming
parrot
makes
my
blood
run
cold
gabriel
trump
the
big
bull
elephant
squeals
rain
to
the
parched
herd
the
monkeys
scold
and
jabber
that
it
rain
water
they
want
it
makes
me
sick
to
see
a
monkey
pant
i
foot
it
home
to
try
and
make
believe
i
sober
after
this
i
stick
to
beer
and
drop
the
circus
when
the
sane
folks
leave
a
man
a
fool
to
look
at
things
too
near
they
look
back
and
begin
to
cut
up
queer
beasts
do
at
any
rate
especially
wild
devils
caged
they
have
the
coolest
way
of
being
something
else
than
what
you
see
you
pass
a
sleek
young
zebra
nosing
hay
a
nylghau
looking
bored
and
distingué
and
think
you
seen
a
donkey
and
a
bird
not
on
your
life
just
glance
back
if
you
dare
the
zebra
chews
the
nylghau
has
stirred
but
something
happened
heaven
knows
what
or
where
to
freeze
your
scalp
and
pompadour
your
hair
i
not
precisely
an
æolian
lute
hung
in
the
wandering
winds
of
sentiment
but
drown
me
if
the
ugliest
meanest
brute
grunting
and
fretting
in
that
sultry
tent
did
just
floor
me
with
embarrassment
was
like
a
from
out
the
clear
one
minute
they
were
circus
beasts
some
grand
some
ugly
some
amusing
and
some
queer
rival
attractions
to
the
hobo
band
the
flying
jenny
and
the
peanut
stand
next
minute
they
were
old
of
mine
lost
people
eyeing
me
with
such
a
stare
patient
satiric
devilish
divine
a
gaze
of
hopeless
envy
squalid
care
hatred
and
thwarted
love
and
dim
despair
within
my
blood
my
ancient
kindred
spoke
grotesque
and
monstrous
voices
heard
afar
down
ocean
caves
when
behemoth
awoke
or
through
fern
forests
roared
the
plesiosaur
locked
with
the
in
ghastly
war
and
suddenly
as
in
a
flash
of
light
i
saw
great
nature
working
out
her
plan
through
all
her
shapes
from
mastodon
to
mite
forever
groping
testing
passing
on
to
find
at
last
the
shape
and
soul
of
man
till
in
the
fullness
of
accomplished
time
comes
brother
forepaugh
upon
business
bent
tracks
her
through
frozen
and
through
torrid
clime
and
shows
us
neatly
labeled
in
a
tent
the
stages
of
her
huge
experiment
blabbing
aloud
her
shy
and
reticent
hours
dragging
to
light
her
blinking
slothful
moods
publishing
fretful
seasons
when
her
powers
worked
wild
and
sullen
in
her
solitudes
or
when
her
mordant
laughter
shook
the
woods
here
round
about
me
were
her
vagrant
births
sick
dreams
she
had
fierce
projects
she
essayed
her
qualms
her
fiery
prides
her
crazy
mirths
the
troublings
of
her
spirit
as
she
strayed
cringed
gloated
mocked
was
lordly
was
afraid
on
that
long
road
she
went
to
seek
mankind
here
were
the
darkling
coverts
that
she
beat
to
find
the
hider
she
was
sent
to
find
here
the
distracted
footprints
of
her
feet
whereby
her
soul
desire
she
came
to
greet
but
why
should
they
her
turn
about
and
stare
disdain
at
me
her
finished
job
why
was
the
place
one
vast
suspended
shout
of
laughter
why
did
all
the
daylight
throb
with
soundless
guffaw
and
sob
helpless
i
stood
among
those
awful
cages
the
beasts
were
walking
loose
and
i
was
bagged
i
i
last
product
of
the
toiling
ages

heroic

a
little
man
in

slightly
jagged
deliver
me
from
such
another
jury
the
will
be
a
picnic
to
their
satire
was
more
dreadful
than
their
fury
and
worst
of
all
was
just
a
kind
of
brute
disgust
and
giving
up
and
sinking
mute
survival
of
the
fittest
adaptation
and
all
their
other
evolution
terms
seem
to
omit
one
small
consideration
to
wit
that
tumblebugs

soul
in
everything
that
squirms
and
souls
are
restless

impatient
things
all
dream
and
unaccountable
desire
crawling
but
pestered
with
the
thought
of
wings
spreading
through
every
inch
of
earth
old
mire
mystical
hanker
after
something
higher
wishes
horses
as
i
understand
i
guess
a
wistful
polyp
that
has
strokes
of
feeling
faint
to
gallivant
on

will
come
to
be
a
scandal
to
his
folks
legs
he
will
sprout
in
spite
of
threats
and
jokes
and
at
the
core
of
every
life
that
crawls
or
runs
or
flies
or
swims
or
vegetates
churning
the
mammoth
in

galls

for

yes
in
the
dim
brain
of
the
jellied
fish
that
is
and
is
not
living
moved
and
stirred
from
the
beginning
a
mysterious
wish
a
vision
a
command
a
fatal
word
the
name
of
man
was
uttered
and
they
heard
upward
along
the
æons
of
old
war
they
sought
him
wing
and
claw
and
bill
were
fashioned
and
rejected
wide
and
far
they
roamed
the
twilight
jungles
of
their
will
but
still
they
sought
him
and
desired
him
still
man
they
desired
but
mind
you
perfect
man
the
radiant
and
the
loving
yet
to
be
i
hardly
wonder
when
they
came
to
scan
the
upshot
of
their
strenuosity
they
gazed
with
mixed
emotions
upon
well
my
advice
to
you
is
face
the
creatures
or
spot
them
sideways
with
your
weather
eye
just
to
keep
tab
on
their
expansive
features
it
is
pleasant
when
you
stepping
high
to
catch
a
giraffe
smiling
on
the
sly
if
nature
made
you
graceful
do
get
gay
before
the
hippopotamus
if
meek
and
godly
find
some
place
to
play
besides
right
where
three
mad
hyenas
fuss
you
may
hear
language
that
we
wo
discuss
if
you
a
sweet
thing
in
a
hat
or
her
best
fellow
with
your
tie
tucked
in
do
squander
love
bright
springtime
girding
at
an
old
chimpanzee
with
an
irish
chin
may
be
hidden
meaning
in
his
the
golden
journey
all
day
he
drowses
by
the
sail
with
dreams
of
her
and
all
night
long
the
broken
waters
are
at
song
of
how
she
lingers
wild
and
pale
when
all
the
temple
lights
are
dumb
and
weaves
her
spells
to
make
him
come
the
wide
sea
traversed
he
will
stand
with
straining
eyes
until
the
shoal
green
water
from
the
prow
shall
roll
upon
the
yellow
strip
of
sand
searching
some
tangled
way
into
the
forest
old
and
grey
then
he
will
leap
upon
the
shore
and
cast
one
look
up
at
the
sun
over
his
loosened
locks
will
run
the
dawn
breeze
and
a
bird
will
pour
its
rapture
out
to
make
life
seem
too
sweet
to
leave
for
such
a
dream
but
all
the
swifter
will
he
go
through
the
pale
scattered
asphodels
down
dusk
of
olive
dells
to
where
the
ancient
basins
throw
fleet
threads
of
blue
and
trembling
zones
of
gold
upon
the
temple
stones
there
noon
keeps
just
a
twilight
trace
twixt
love
and
hate
and
death
and
birth
no
man
may
choose
nor
sobs
nor
mirth
may
enter
in
that
haunted
place
all
day
the
fountain
sphynx
lets
drip
slow
drops
of
silence
from
her
lip
to
hold
the
slender
girls
of
marble
stand
arow
doubt
never
blurs
a
single
brow
and
never
the
noon
faintness
curls
from
their
expectant
hush
of
pride
the
lips
the
god
has
glorified
but
these
things
he
will
barely
view
or
if
he
stay
to
heed
them
still
but
as
the
lark
the
lights
that
spill
from
out
the
sun
it
soars
unto
where
past
the
splendors
and
the
heats
the
sun
heart
self
forever
beats
for
wide
the
brazen
doors
will
swing
soon
as
his
sandals
touch
the
pave
the
anxious
light
inside
will
wave
and
tremble
to
a
lunar
ring
about
the
form
that
lieth
prone
before
the
dreadful
she
will
not
look
or
speak
or
stir
but
with
drowned
lips
and
cheeks
will
lie
amid
the
pool
of
light
until
grown
faint
with
thirst
of
her
he
shall
bow
down
his
face
and
sink
breathless
beneath
the
eddying
brink
then
a
swift
music
will
begin
and
as
the
brazen
doors
shut
slow
there
will
be
hurrying
to
and
fro
and
lights
and
calls
and
silver
din
while
through
the
swirl
of
air
the
god
sweet
cruel
eyes
will
stare
heart
her
lids
shall
lift
again
slow
soft
with
vague
desire
and
lay
about
my
breast
and
brain
their
hush
of
spirit
fire
and
i
shall
take
the
sweet
of
pain
as
the
laborer
his
hire
and
though
no
word
shall
be
said
to
ease
the
ghostly
sting
and
though
our
hearts
unhoused
unfed
must
still
go
wandering
my
sign
is
set
upon
her
head
while
stars
do
meet
and
sing
not
such
a
sign
as
women
wear
who
make
their
foreheads
tame
with
life
long
tolerance
and
bear
love
sweetest
humblest
name
nor
such
as
passion
eateth
bare
with
its
crown
of
tears
and
flame
nor
such
a
sign
as
happy
friend
sets
on
his
friend
dear
brow
when
break
and
blend
to
a
key
of
autumn
woe
and
the
woodland
says
playtime
at
end
best
unclasp
hands
and
go
but
where
she
strays
through
blight
or
blooth
one
fadeless
flower
she
wears
a
little
gift
god
gave
my
youth
whose
petals
dim
were
fears
awes
adorations
songs
of
ruth
hesitancies
and
tears
o
heart
of
mine
with
all
thy
powers
of
white
beatitude
what
are
the
dearest
of
god
dowers
to
the
children
of
his
blood
how
blow
the
shy
shy
wilding
flowers
in
the
hollows
of
his
wood
harmonics
this
string
upon
my
harp
was
best
beloved
i
thought
i
knew
its
secrets
through
and
through
till
an
old
man
whose
young
eyes
lightened
blue
his
white
hair
bent
over
me
and
moved
his
fingers
up
and
down
and
broke
the
wire
to
such
a
laddered
music
rung
on
rung
as
from
the
patriarch
pillow
skyward
sprung
crowded
with
wings
and
feet
of
fire
o
vibrant
heart
so
metely
tuned
and
strung
that
any
untaught
hand
can
draw
from
thee
one
clear
gold
note
that
makes
the
tired
years
young
what
of
the
time
when
love
had
whispered
me
where
slept
thy
nodes
and
my
hand
pausefully
gave
to
the
dim
harmonics
voice
and
tongue
on
the
river
the
faint
stars
wake
and
wonder
fade
and
find
heart
anew
above
us
and
far
under
sphereth
the
watchful
blue
silent
she
sits
outbending
a
wild
pathetic
grace
a
beauty
strange
upon
her
hair
and
face
o
spirit
cries
that
sever
the
cricket
level
drone
o
to
give
endeavor
and
let
love
have
its
own
within
the
mirrored
bushes
there
wakes
a
little
stir
the
moves
and
hushes
her
nestlings
under
her
beneath
the
lustrous
river
the
watchful
sky
god
god
that
thou
ever
poison
thy
children
bread
the
bracelet
of
grass
the
opal
heart
of
afternoon
was
clouding
on
to
throbs
of
storm
ashen
within
the
ardent
west
the
lips
of
thunder
muttered
harm
and
as
a
bubble
like
to
break
hung
heaven
trembling
amethyst
when
with
the
by
the
lake
i
braceleted
her
wrist
and
when
the
ribbon
grass
was
tied
sad
with
the
happiness
we
planned
palm
linked
in
palm
we
stood
awhile
and
watched
the
raindrops
dot
the
sand
until
the
anger
of
the
breeze
chid
all
the
lake
bright
breathing
down
and
ravished
all
the
radiancies
from
her
deep
eyes
of
brown
we
gazed
from
shelter
on
the
storm
and
through
our
hearts
swept
ghostly
pain
to
see
the
shards
of
day
sweep
past
broken
and
none
might
mend
again
broken
that
none
shall
ever
mend
loosened
that
none
shall
ever
tie
o
the
wind
and
the
wind
will
it
never
end
o
the
sweeping
past
of
the
ruined
sky
the
departure
i
i
sat
beside
the
glassy
evening
sea
one
foot
upon
the
thin
horn
of
my
lyre
and
all
its
strings
of
laughter
and
desire
crushed
in
the
rank
wet
grasses
heedlessly
nor
did
my
dull
eyes
care
to
question
how
the
boat
close
by
had
spread
its
saffron
sails
nor
what
might
mean
the
coffers
and
the
bales
and
streaks
of
new
wine
on
the
gilded
prow
neither
was
wonder
in
me
when
i
saw
fair
women
step
therein
though
they
were
fair
even
to
adoration
and
to
awe
and
in
the
gracious
fillets
of
their
hair
were
blossoms
from
a
garden
i
had
known
sweet
mornings
ere
the
apple
buds
were
blown
ii
one
gazed
steadfast
into
the
dying
west
with
lips
apart
to
greet
the
evening
star
and
one
with
eyes
that
caught
the
strife
and
jar
of
the
sea
heart
followed
the
sunward
breast
of
a
lone
gull
from
a
slow
harp
one
drew
blind
music
like
a
laugh
or
like
a
wail
and
in
the
uncertain
shadow
of
the
sail
one
wove
a
crown
of
berries
and
of
yew
yet
even
as
i
said
with
dull
desire
all
these
were
mine
and
one
was
mine
indeed
the
smoky
music
burst
into
a
fire
and
i
was
left
alone
in
my
great
need
one
foot
upon
the
thin
horn
of
my
lyre
and
all
its
strings
crushed
in
the
dripping
weed
faded
pictures
only
two
patient
eyes
to
stare
out
of
the
canvas
all
the
rest
the
warm
green
gown
the
small
hands
pressed
light
in
the
lap
the
braided
hair
that
must
have
made
the
sweet
low
brow
so
earnest
centuries
ago
when
some
one
saw
it
change
and
glow
all
faded
just
the
eyes
burn
now
i
dare
say
people
pass
and
pass
before
the
blistered
little
frame
and
dingy
work
without
a
name
stuck
in
behind
its
square
of
glass
but
i
well
i
left
raphael
just
to
come
drink
these
eyes
of
hers
to
think
away
the
stains
and
blurs
and
make
all
new
again
and
well
only
for
tears
my
head
will
bow
because
there
on
my
heart
last
wall
scarce
one
tint
left
to
tell
it
all
a
picture
keeps
its
eyes
somehow
a
grey
day
grey
drizzling
mists
the
moorlands
drape
rain
whitens
the
dead
sea
from
headland
dim
to
sullen
cape
grey
sails
creep
wearily
i
know
not
how
that
merchantman
has
found
the
heart
but
is
her
plan
seaward
her
endless
course
to
shape
unreal
as
insects
that
appall
a
drunkard
peevish
brain
the
grey
deep
the
dories
crawl
with
rowers
twain
midgets
and
minims
of
the
earth
across
old
ocean
vasty
girth
toiling
heroic
comical
i
wonder
how
that
merchant
crew
have
ever
found
the
will
i
wonder
what
the
fishers
do
to
keep
them
toiling
still
i
wonder
how
the
heart
of
man
has
patience
to
live
out
its
span
or
wait
until
its
dreams
come
true
the
ride
back
the
coming
of
the
dark
he
dreamed
an
faded
story
of
a
knight
much
like
in
need
to
him
who
was
no
knight
and
of
a
road
much
like
the
road
his
soul
groped
over
desperate
to
meet
her
soul
beside
the
bed
death
waited
and
he
his
limbs
were
heavy
from
the
fight
his
mail
was
dark
with
dust
and
blood
on
his
good
horse
they
bound
him
tight
and
on
his
breast
they
bound
the
rood
to
help
him
in
the
ride
that
night
when
he
crashed
through
the
wood
wet
rim
about
the
dabbled
reeds
a
breeze
went
moaning
broken
words
and
dim
the
haggard
shapes
of
twilight
trees
caught
with
their
scrawny
hands
at
him
between
the
doubtful
aisles
of
day
strange
folk
and
lamentable
stood
to
maze
and
beckon
him
astray
but
through
the
grey
wrath
of
the
wood
he
held
right
on
his
bitter
way
when
he
came
where
the
trees
were
thin
the
moon
sat
waiting
there
to
see
on
her
worn
palm
she
laid
her
chin
and
laughed
awhile
in
sober
glee
to
think
how
strong
this
knight
had
been
when
he
rode
past
the
pallid
lake
the
withered
yellow
stems
of
flags
stood
for
his
horse
to
break
lewd
as
the
palsied
lips
of
hags
the
petals
in
the
moon
did
shake
when
he
came
by
the
mountain
wall
the
snow
upon
the
heights
looked
down
and
said
the
sight
is
pitiful
the
nostrils
of
his
steed
are
brown
with
frozen
blood
and
he
will
fall
the
iron
passes
of
the
hills
with
question
were
importunate
and
but
the
icy
rills
had
grown
for
once
compassionate
the
spiteful
shades
had
had
their
wills
just
when
the
ache
in
breast
and
brain
and
the
frost
smiting
at
his
face
had
sealed
his
spirit
up
with
pain
he
came
out
in
a
better
place
and
morning
lay
across
the
plain
he
saw
the
wet
snails
crawl
and
cling
on
where
the
rime
had
run
the
careless
birds
went
wing
and
wing
and
in
the
low
smile
of
the
sun
life
seemed
almost
a
pleasant
thing
right
on
the
panting
charger
swung
through
the
bright
depths
of
quiet
grass
the
knight
lips
moved
as
if
they
sung
and
through
the
peace
there
came
to
pass
the
flattery
of
lute
and
tongue
from
the
of
the
mead
there
swelled
a
sob
of
minstrelsy
faint
sackbuts
and
the
dreamy
reed
and
plaintive
lips
of
maids
thereby
and
songs
blown
out
like
thistle
seed
forth
from
her
maidens
came
the
bride
and
as
his
loosened
rein
fell
slack
he
muttered
in
their
throats
they
lied
who
said
that
i
should
win
back
to
kiss
her
lips
before
i
died
and
poppy
i
in
new
york
he
plays
the
deuce
with
my
writing
time
for
the
penny
my
neighbor
throws
he
finds
me
proud
of
my
pondered
rhyme
and
he
leaves
me
well
god
knows
it
takes
the
shine
from
a
tunester
line
when
a
little
mate
of
the
deathless
nine
pipes
up
under
your
nose
for
listen
there
is
his
voice
again
wistful
and
clear
and
piercing
sweet
where
did
the
boy
find
such
a
strain
to
make
a
dead
heart
beat
and
how
in
the
name
of
care
can
he
bear
to
jet
such
a
fountain
into
the
air
in
this
gray
gulch
of
a
street
tuscan
slopes
or
the
piedmontese
umbria
under
the
apennine
south
where
the
terraced
round
rich
sorrento
shine
venice
moon
on
the
smooth
lagoon
where
have
i
heard
that
aching
tune
that
boyish
throat
divine
beyond
my
roofs
and
chimney
pots
a
rag
of
sunset
crumbles
gray
below
fierce
radiance
hangs
in
clots
the
streams
that
never
stay
shrill
and
high
newsboys
cry
the
worst
of
the
city
infamy
for
one
more
sordid
day
but
my
desire
has
taken
sail
for
lands
beyond
down
languorous
leagues
i
hold
the
trail
from
marmalada
steeply
throned
above
high
pastures
washed
with
light
where
dolomite
by
dolomite
looms
sheer
and
to
purple
vineyards
looking
south
on
reaches
of
the
still
tyrrhene
virgilian
headlands
and
the
mouth
of
tiber
where
that
ship
put
in
to
take
the
dead
men
home
to
god
whereof
casella
told
the
mode
to
the
great
florentine

stairways
blue
with
flowering
weed

climb

all

watch
the
thunder
breed
golden
above
the
springs
of
po
till
the
voice
makes
sure
its
wavering
lure
and
by
assisi
portals
pure
i
stand
with
heart
bent
low
o
hear
how
it
blooms
in
the
blear
dayfall
that
flower
of
passionate
wistful
song
how
it
blows
like
a
rose
by
the
iron
wall
of
the
city
loud
and
strong
how
it
cries
nay
nay
to
the
worldling
way
to
the
heart
clear
dream
how
it
whispers
yea
time
comes
though
the
time
is
long

my
roofs

piles
sunset
crumbles
ragged
dire
the
roaring
street
is
hung
for
miles
with
fierce
electric
fire
shrill
and
high
newsboys
cry
the
gross
of
the
planet
destiny
through
one
more
sullen
gyre
stolidly
the
town
flings
down
its
lust
by
day
for
its
nightly

harsh

stout

seize
the
grosser
good
too
hungry
after
dust
o
hark
how
it
blooms
in
the
falling
dark
that
flower
of
mystical
yearning
song
sad
as
a
hermit
thrush
as
a
lark
uplifted
glad
and
strong
heart

chosen
the

sacred

faint
with
dread
his
presence
stands
within
the

mild
splendor

his

gently
he
seems
to
welcome

dare
not

thus
undone

in

awhile
i

for

purged
of

good
glee
and
strife

drained

the
peace
these
old

won

how
the
laughing
earth
says
no

the
fear
that
mastered
me
to
the
blood
that
aches
and

upon

a

flower

down
his

triumphant

dim
indeed
men
build
and

but
the
soul
of
man
coming
with
haughty
eyes
to
scan
feels
richer
wilder
need
how
long
old

time
wilt
bide

at

thrilling

shall
have

nay
move

just
as
you
are
under
the
carved
wings
of
the
chair
the
sifting
through
your
hair
turns
every
dim
pearl
to
a
star
in
floods
of
brightening
air
i
have
been
thinking
of
that
night
when
all
the
wide
hall
burst
to
blaze
with
spears
caught
up
thrust
fifty
ways
to
find
my
throat
while
i
lay
white
and
sick
with
joy
to
think
the
days
i
dragged
out
in
your
hateful
north
a
slave
constrained
at
banquet
need
to
fill
the
black
bull
horns
with
mead
for
drunken
were
henceforth
cast
from
me
as
a
poison
weed
while
death
thrust
roses
in
my
hands
but
you
who
knew
the
flowers
he
had
were
no
such
roses
ripe
and
glad
as
nod
in
my
far
southern
lands
but
pallid
things
to
make
men
sad
put
back
the
spears
with
one
calm
hand
raised
on
your
knee
my
wondering
head
wiped
off
the
trickling
drops
of
red
from
my
torn
forehead
with
a
strand
of
your
bright
loosened
hair
and
said
would
you
kill
a
skald
this
boy
has
hearkened
odin
sing
unto
the
clang
and
winnowing
of
raven
wings
his
heart
is
thralled
to
music
as
to
some
strong
king
and
this
great
thraldom
works
disdain
of
lesser
serving
once
release
these
bonds
he
bears
and
he
may
please
to
give
you
guerdon
sweet
as
rain
to
sailors
calmed
in
thirsty
seas
then
having
soothed
their
rage
to
rest
you
led
me
to
old
skagi
throne
where
yellow
gold
rims
in
the
stone
and
in
my
arms
against
my
breast
thrust
his
great
harp
of
walrus
bone
how
they
came
crowding
tunes
on
tunes
how
good
it
was
to
touch
the
strings
and
feel
them
thrill
like
happy
things
that
flutter
from
the
gray
cocoons
on
hedge
rows
in
your
gradual
springs
all
grew
a
blur
before
my
sight
as
when
the
stealthy
white
fog
slips
at
noonday
on
the
staggering
ships
i
saw
one
single
spot
of
light
your
white
face
with
its
eager
lips
and
so
i
sang
to
that
o
thou
who
liftedst
me
from
out
my
shame
wert
thou
content
when
skagi
came
put
his
own
chaplet

the
waves
that
wash
this
mountain
base
were
crimson
in
the
sun
low
rays
when
singing
high
and
fast
an
angel
downward
passed
to
bid
some
patient
soul
arise
and
make
it
fair
for
paradise
and
upward
so
attended
that
soul
its
journey
wended
yet
you
who
in
these
lower
rings
wait
for
the
coming
of
such
wings
turned
not
your
eyes
to
view
whether
they
came
for
you
but
watched
but
watched
great
virgil
stayed
greeting
sordello
couchant
shade
which
to
salute
him
rose
like
lion
from
its
pose
while
humbly
by
those
lords
of
song
stood
he
whose
living
limbs
are
strong
to
mount
where
mary
bliss
is
shed
on
beatrice
on
him
your
gaze
was
fastened
more
than
on
those
great
names
mantua
bore
your
eyes
hold
the
distress
still
of
that
wistfulness
yea
fit
he
seemed
much
love
to
rouse
his
pilgrim
lips
and
iron
brows
grew
like
a
woman
dim
while
you
held
speech
with
him
and
troubled
came
his
mortal
breath
the
while
i
told
him
of
my
death
his
looks
were
changed
and
wan
when
virgil
led
him
on
vi
la
pia
since
casella
came
this
morn
newly
yonder
ocean
borne
bound
upward
for
the
choir
who
purge
themselves
in
fire
and
from
that
meinie
he
was
of
stayed
backward
at
my
cry
of
love
to
speak
awhile
with
me
of
life
and
tuscany
and
parting
told
us
how
day
was
done
dante
would
come
this
way
with
mortal
feet
to
find
his
sweetheart
since
casella
spoke
such
news
my
heart
has
lain
in
a
golden
muse
picturing
him
and
her
what
starry
ones
they
were
and
now
the
moon
sheds
its
compassion
the
hushed
mount
i
try
to
fashion
the
manner
of
their
meeting
their
few
first
words
of
greeting
o
well
for
them
with
claspèd
hands
unshamed
amid
the
heavenly
bands
they
hear
no
pitying
pair
of
lovers
there
look
down
and
say
in
an
undertone
this
who
comes
alone
was
still
alone
on
earth
and
lonely
from
his
birth
nor
feel
a
sudden
whisper
mar
god
weather
dost
thou
see
the
scar
that
spirit
hideth
so
who
dealt
her
such
a
blow
that
god
can
hardly
wipe
it
out
and
answer
she
gave
love
no
doubt
to
one
who
saw
not
fit
to
set
much
store
by
it
the
daguerreotype
this
then
is
she
my
mother
as
she
looked
at
seventeen
when
she
first
met
my
father
young
incredibly
younger
than
spring
without
the
faintest
trace
of
disappointment
weariness
or
tean
upon
the
childlike
earnestness
and
grace
of
the
waiting
face
these
ropes
of
pearl
or
common
beads
made
precious
by
their
use
seem
heavy
for
so
slight
a
throat
to
wear
but
the
low
bodice
leaves
the
shoulders
bare
and
half
the
glad
swell
of
the
breast
for
news
that
now
the
woman
stirs
within
the
girl
and
yet
even
so
the
loops
and
globes
of
beaten
gold
and
jet
hung
in
the
stately
way
of
old
from
the
ears
drooping
lobes
on
festivals
and
of
the
week
show
all
too
for
the
cheek
which
now
i
look
again
is
perfect
child
or
no
or
no
is
girlhood
very
self
moulded
by
some
deep
elf
so
meek
so
maiden
mild
but
startling
the
close
gazer
with
the
sense
of
passions
and
and
delicate
delirious
merriments
as
a
moth
beats
sidewise
and
up
and
over
and
tries
to
skirt
the
irresistible
lure
of
the
flame
that
has
him
sure
my
spirit
that
is
none
too
strong
flutters
and
makes
delay
pausing
to
wonder
on
the
perfect
lips
lifting
to
muse
upon
the
hair
and
each
hid
radiance
there
but
powerless
to
stem
the
bright
the
vehement
peace
which
drifts
it
toward
the
light
where
soon
ah
now
with
cries
of
grief
and
unto
its
gain
it
shrinks
no
longer
nor
denies
but
dips
hurriedly
home
to
the
exquisite
heart
of
pain
and
all
is
well
for
i
have
seen
them
plain
the
unforgettable
the
unforgotten
eyes
across
the
blinding
gush
of
these
good
tears
they
shine
as
in
the
sweet
and
heavy
years
when
by
her
bed
and
chair
we
children
gathered
jealously
to
share
the
sunlit
aura
breathing
myrrh
and
thyme
where
the
body
made
a
clime
gentler
than
may
and
pleasanter
than
rhyme
holier
and
more
mystical
than
prayer
god
how
thy
ways
are
strange
that
this
should
be
even
this
the
patient
head
which
suffered
years
ago
the
dreary
change
that
these
so
dewy
lips
should
be
the
same
as
those
i
stooped
to
kiss
and
heard
my
harrowing
name
a
little
ere
the
one
who
bowed
above
her
our
father
and
her
very
constant
lover
rose
stoical
and
we
knew
that
she
was
dead
then
i
who
could
not
understand
or
share
his
antique
nobleness
being
unapt
to
bear
the
insults
which
time
flings
us
for
our
proof
fled
from
the
horrible
roof
into
the
alien
sunshine
merciless
the
shrill
satiric
fields
ghastly
with
day
raging
to
front
god
in
his
pride
of
sway
and
hurl
across
the
lifted
swords
of
fate
that
ringed
him
where
he
sat
my
puny
gage
of
scorn
and
desolate
hate
which
somehow
should
undo
him
after
all
that
this
girl
face
expectant
virginal
which
gazes
out
at
me
boon
as
a
sweetheart
as
if
nothing
loth
save
for
the
eyes
with
other
presage
stored
to
pledge
me
troth
and
in
the
kingdom
where
the
heart
is
lord
take
sail
on
the
terrible
gladness
of
the
deep
whose
winds
the
gray
norns
keep
that
this
should
be
indeed
the
flesh
which
caught
my
soul
a
flying
seed
out
of
the
to
and
fro
of
scattering
hands
where
the
seedsman
mage
stooping
from
star
to
star
and
age
to
age
sings
as
he
sows
that
underneath
this
breast
nine
moons
i
fed
deep
of
divine
unrest
while
over
and
over
in
the
dark
she
said
blessèd
but
not
as
happier
children
blessed
that
this
should
be
even
she
god
how
with
time
and
change
thou
makest
thy
footsteps
strange
ah
now
i
know
they
play
upon
me
and
it
is
not
so
why
is
a
girl
i
never
saw
before
a
little
thing
to
flatter
and
make
weep
to
tease
until
her
heart
is
sore
then
kiss
and
clear
the
score
a
gypsy
a
little
liberal
daughter
of
the
earth
good
for
what
hour
of
truancy
and
mirth
the
careless
season
yields
the
flood
o
the
year
and
yonder
of
the
neap
then
thank
you
thanks
again
and
twenty
light
o
shrined
above
the
skies
frown
not
clear
brow
darken
not
holy
eyes
thou
knowest
well
i
know
that
it
is
thou
only
to
save
me
from
such
memories
as
would
unman
me
quite
here
in
this
web
of
strangeness
caught
and
prey
to
troubled
thought
do
i
devise
these
foolish
shifts
and
slight
only
to
shield
me
from
the
afflicting
sense
of
some
waste
influence
which
from
this
morning
face
and
lustrous
hair
breathes
on
me
sudden
ruin
and
despair
in
any
other
guise
with
any
but
this
girlish
depth
of
gaze
your
coming
had
not
so
unsealed
and
poured
the
dusty
amphoras
where
i
had
stored
the
drippings
of
the
winepress
of
my
days
i
think
these
eyes
foresee
now
in
their
unawakened
virgin
time
their
mother
pride
in
me
and
dream
even
now
unconsciously
upon
each
soaring
peak
and
lea
you
pictured
i
should
climb
broken
premonitions
come
shapes
gestures
visionary
not
as
once
to
maiden
mary
the
manifest
angel
with
fresh
lilies
came
intelligibly
calling
her
by
name
but
vanishingly
dumb
thwarted
and
bright
and
wild
as
heralding
a
passionate
who
yet
should
be
a
trump
of
mighty
call
blown
in
the
gates
of
evil
kings
to
make
them
fall
who
yet
should
be
a
sword
of
flame
before
the
soul
inviolate
door
to
beat
away
the
clang
of
hellish
wings
who
yet
should
be
a
lyre
of
high
unquenchable
desire
in
the
day
of
little
look
where
the
amphoras
the
yield
of
many
days
trod
by
my
hot
soul
from
the
pulp
of
self
and
set
upon
the
shelf
in
sullen
pride
the
tasting
to
abide
o
mother
mine
are
these
the
the
doings
fine
of
him
you
used
to
praise
emptied
and
overthrown
the
jars
lie
strown
these
for
their
flavor
duly
nursed
drip
from
the
stopples
vinegar
accursed
these
i
thought
honied
to
the
very
seal
dry
dry
a
little
acid
meal
a
pinch
of
mouldy
dust
sole
leavings
of
the
must
these
rude
to
look
upon
but
flasking
up
the
liquor
dearest
won
through
sacred
hours
and
hard
with
watching
and
with
wrestlings
and
with
grief
even
of
these
of
these
in
chief
the
stale
breath
sickens
reeking
from
the
shard
nothing
is
left
ay
how
much
less
than
naught
what
shall
be
said
or
thought
of
the
slack
hours
and
waste
imaginings
the
cynic
rending
of
the
wings
known
to
that
froward
that
unreckoning
heart
whereof
this
brewage
was
the
precious
part
treasured
and
set
away
with
furtive
boast
o
dear
and
cruel
ghost
be
merciful
be
just
see
i
was
yours
and
i
am
in
the
dust
then
look
not
so
as
if
all
things
were
well
take
your
eyes
from
me
leave
me
to
my
shame
or
else
if
gaze
they
must
steel
them
with
judgment
darken
them
with
blame
but
by
the
ways
of
light
ineffable
you
bade
me
go
and
i
have
faltered
from
by
the
low
waters
moaning
out
of
hell
whereto
my
feet
have
come
lay
not
on
me
these
intolerable
looks
of
rejoicing

of
pride
of
happy
trust
nothing
dismayed
by
all
i

and
all

then
stay
by
me
let
these
eyes
afflict
me
cleanse
me
keep
me

brave
eyes
and
true
see
how
the
shriveled
heart
that
long
has
lain
dead
to
delight

stirs
and
