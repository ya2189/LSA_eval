introductory
notice
at
the
commencement
of
the
year
a
captivating
little
volume
of
poems
was
mysteriously
issued
from
the
leadenhalle
presse
of
field
and
tuer
a
quaint
book
tied
up
on
all
sides
with
strings
of
golden
silk
ribbon
and
illustrated
throughout
with
fanciful
it
was
entitled
love
letters
by
a
violinist
and
those
who
were
at
first
attracted
by
its
title
and
suggestive
outward
appearance
untied
the
ribbons
with
a
certain
amount
of
curiosity
were
surely
of
a
private
almost
sacred
character
what
violinist
thus
ventured
to
publish
his
openly
and
were
they
worth
reading
were
the
questions
asked
by
the
public
and
last
not
least
came
the
natural
inquiry
was
the
to
this
no
satisfactory
answer
could
be
obtained
for
nobody
knew
but
it
was
directly
proved
on
perusal
of
the
book
that
he
was
a
poet
not
a
mere
writer
of
verse
speculations
arose
as
to
his
identity
and
joseph
ellis
the
poet
reviewed
the
work
as
follows
behold
a
mystery
who
shall
uncase
it
a
small
quarto
anonymous
the
publisher
professes
entire
ignorance
of
its
origin
wild
guesses
spring
from
the
mask
of
a
who
can
he
be
derivatur
a
tyro
the
work
is
too
skilful
for
such
though
even
a
byron
young
not
old
tennyson
no
he
hath
not
the
grace
of
style
at
least
for
these
verses
browning
no
he
could
not
unbend
so
far
edwin
arnold
might
possibly
have
been
equal
to
it
witness
but
he
is
unlikely
lytton
bulwer
a
voice
from
the
tomb
no
his
son
owen
meredith
a
random
supposition
yet
possible
rossetti
again
a
voice
from
the
tomb
no
he
wanted
the
strength
of
wing
james
thomson
the
younger
could
have
done
it
but
he
was
too
stern
then
our
detective
ingenuity
proving
incompetent
who
we
seek
the
delphic
fane
the
oracle
replies
let
us
bow
to
the
oracular
voice
for
in
swinburne
we
find
all
requisites
for
the
work
fertility
of
thought
grace
of
language
ingenuity
skill
in
the
wealth
of
words
sensuous
nature
classic
resources
the
writer
of
the
is
manifestly
imbued
with
the
tone
and
tune
of
italian
poetry
and
has
the
merit
of
proving
the
english
tongue
capable
of
rivalling
the
italian
he
is
a
master
of
versification
so
is
swinburne
he
is
praiseworthy
for
freshness
of
thought
novelty
and
aptness
in
imagery
so
is
swinburne
he
is
remarkable
for
sustained
energy
so
is
swinburne
and
thus
it
may
safely
be
said
that
if
not
the
writer
of
the
he
deserves
to
be
accredited
with
that
mysterious
production
until
the
authorship
is
avowed
unto
britannia
as
erst
to
italia
has
been
granted
a
a
petrarch
meanwhile
other
leading
voices
in
the
press
joined
the
swelling
chorus
of
praise
morning
took
up
the
theme
and
after
vainly
endeavouring
to
clear
up
the
mystery
of
the
authorship
went
on
to
say
the
appearance
of
this
book
must
be
regarded
as
a
literary
phenomenon
we
find
ourselves
lifted
at
once
by
the
author
genius
out
of
the
world
of
the
england
of
and
transported
into
an
atmosphere
as
rare
and
ethereal
as
that
in
which
the
poet
of
vaucluse
lived
and
moved
and
had
his
being
in
nearly
every
stanza
there
are
unerring
indications
of
a
mind
and
heart
steeped
in
that
subtlest
of
all
forms
of
beauty
the
mythology
of
old
greece
the
reader
perceives
at
once
that
he
has
to
do
with
a
scholar
and
man
of
culture
as
well
as
with
an
inspired
singer
whose
muse
need
not
feel
abashed
in
the
presence
of
the
highest
poets
of
our
own
day
such
expressions
as
a
new
star
of
brilliant
magnitude
has
risen
above
the
literary
horizon
in
the
anonymous
author
of
the
exquisite
book
of
and
these
poems
are
among
the
most
graceful
and
beautiful
productions
of
modern
times
became
frequent
in
the
best
literary
journals
and
private
opinion
concerning
the
book
began
to
make
its
influence
felt
the
brilliant
writer
and
astute
critic
george
meredith
wrote
to
a
friend
on
the
subject
as
follows
the
lines
and
metre
of
the
poems
are
easy
and
interthreading
and
perfectly
melodious
it
is
an
astonishing
production
the
work
of
a
true
musician
in
our
tongue
special
correspondent
antonio
gallenga
expressed
himself
at
some
length
on
the
merits
of
the
violinist
and
spoke
of
him
as
one
who
could
conjure
up
a
host
of
noble
thoughts
and
bright
fancies
who
rejoices
in
a
great
command
of
language
with
a
flow
of
verse
and
a
wealth
of
rhymes
it
is
impossible
to
hear
his
confessions
to
follow
him
in
his
aspirations
to
hear
the
tale
of
his
visions
his
trances
his
dreams
without
catching
his
enthusiasm
and
bestowing
on
him
our
sympathy
each
is
in
twenty
stanzas
each
stanza
in
six
lines
the
poem
is
regular
and
symmetrical
as
dante
with
as
stately
and
solemn
aye
and
as
arduous
a
measure
while
the
world
of
art
and
letters
thus
discussed
the
volume
reading
it
meanwhile
with
such
eagerness
that
the
whole
edition
was
soon
entirely
exhausted
a
particularly
brilliant
and
critique
of
it
appeared
in
the
new
york
a
very
prominent
american
journal
destined
afterwards
to
declare
the
author
identity
and
to
be
the
first
to
do
so
in
the
columns
of
this
paper
had
been
frequently
seen
some
peculiarly
graceful
and
impassioned
poems
signed
by
one
eric
mackay
notable
among
these
being
a
lyric
entitled
the
waking
of
the
lark
included
in
our
present
volume
which
to
quote
the
expression
of
a
distinguished
new
york
critic
sent
a
thrill
through
the
heart
of
america
there
are
no
skylarks
in
the
new
world
but
there
is
a
deep
tenderness
felt
by
all
americans
for
the
little
priest
in
grey
apparel
who
doth
prepare
to
sing
in
air
his
sinless
summer
carol
and
eric
mackay
exquisite
outburst
of
tender
enthusiasm
for
the
english
bird
of
the
morning
evoked
from
all
parts
of
the
states
a
chorus
of
critical
delight
and
approbation
the
rev
munger
of
massachusetts
wrote
concerning
it
this
strikes
me
as
the
best
poem
i
have
seen
for
a
long
time
as
i
read
it
stanza
after
stanza
with
not
an
imperfect
verse
not
a
commonplace
but
with
a
sustained
increase
of
pure
sentiment
and
glowing
fancy
i
was
inclined
to
place
it
beside
shelley
it
is
not
so
intellectual
as
shelley
but
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
not
truer
mackay
is
the
lark
itself
shelley
is
himself
listening
to
the
lark
besides
shelley
makes
the
lark
sing
at
evening
as
i
believe
it
does
but
surely
to
the
morning
doth
belong
and
shakespeare
is
truer
in
putting
it
at
gate
it
is
a
great
refreshment
to
us
tired
workers
in
the
prose
of
life
to
come
across
such
a
poem
as
this
and
seldom
enough
it
happens
nowadays
tell
eric
mackay
to
sing
us
another
song
paul
hamilton
hayne
an
american
poet
praised
it
in
an
american
paper
and
the
cultured
maurice
thompson
writes
this
touches
the
best
mark
of
simplicity
sweetness
and
naturalness
in
its
modelling
this
admired
lyric
was
copied
from
the
into
many
other
journals
together
with
several
other
poems
by
the
same
hand
such
as
a
vision
of
beethoven
the
beautiful
verses
addressed
to
the
spanish
violinist
pablo
de
sarasate
and
a
spirited
reply
to
algernon
charles
swinburne
reproaching
him
for
the
attack
which
the
author
of
tristram
of
lyonesse
had
made
on
england
name
and
fame
one
day
a
simple
statement
appeared
in
the
respecting
the
much
discussed
by
a
violinist
that
the
author
was
simply
a
gentleman
of
good
position
the
descendant
of
a
distinguished
and
very
ancient
family
eric
mackay
known
among
his
personal
friends
and
intimates
as
a
man
of
brilliant
and
extensive
learning
whose
frequent
and
long
residences
abroad
have
made
him
somewhat
of
a
foreigner
though
by
birth
an
englishman
a
fine
linguist
a
deep
thinker
a
profound
student
of
the
classics
mackay
may
be
ranked
among
the
most
cultured
and
accomplished
men
of
his
day
and
still
young
as
he
is
will
undoubtedly
be
numbered
with
the
choice
few
whose
names
are
destined
to
live
by
the
side
of
poets
such
as
keats
whom
as
far
as
careful
work
delicate
feeling
and
fiery
tenderness
go
eric
mackay
may
be
said
to
resemble
though
there
is
a
greater
robustness
and
force
in
his
muse
indicative
of
a
strong
mind
in
an
equally
strong
and
healthy
body
which
latter
advantage
the
divine
keats
had
not
unfortunately
for
himself
and
the
world
the
innate
hardly
restrained
vigour
of
mackay
nature
shows
itself
in
such
passages
as
occur
in
the
sonnets
remorse
a
thunderstorm
at
night
also
in
the
wild
and
terribly
suggestive
zulalie
while
something
of
hot
wrath
and
scorn
leap
out
in
such
lines
as
those
included
in
his
ode
to
swinburne
whom
he
addresses
o
thou
five
foot
five
of
flesh
and
blood
and
sinew
and
the
rest
thou
art
a
bee
a
bright
a
golden
thing
with
too
much
honey
and
the
taste
thereof
is
sometimes
rough
and
something
of
a
sting
dwells
in
the
music
that
we
hear
thee
sing
and
take
back
thy
taunt
i
say
and
with
the
same
accept
our
pardon
or
if
this
offend
why
then
no
pardon
in
england
name
we
have
our
country
still
and
thou
thy
fame
at
the
same
time
no
one
in
all
england
does
more
justice
and
honor
to
swinburne
genius
than
eric
mackay
his
own
strength
as
a
poet
suggests
to
the
reader
the
idea
of
a
spirited
horse
reined
in
tightly
and
persistently
a
horse
which
prances
wildly
at
times
and
frets
and
foams
at
the
bit
and
might
on
the
least
provocation
run
wild
in
a
furious
and
headlong
career
sweeping
all
conventionalities
out
of
its
road
by
a
sheer
gallop
mackay
is
however
a
careful
even
precise
rider
and
he
keeps
a
firm
hand
on
his
restless
pegasus
so
firm
that
as
his
taste
always
leads
him
to
depict
the
most
fanciful
and
fine
emotions
his
steady
resoluteness
of
restraint
commands
not
only
our
admiration
but
our
respect
while
passionate
to
an
extreme
in
the
he
is
never
indelicate
the
coarse
almost
brutal
allusions
made
by
some
writers
to
certain
phases
of
love
which
are
best
left
unsuggested
never
defile
the
pen
of
our
present
author
who
may
almost
be
called
fastidious
in
such
matters
how
beautiful
and
to
the
mind
is
the
line
expressing
the
utter
satisfaction
of
a
victorious
lover
with
a
kiss
and
sceptred
with
a
joy
no
details
are
needed
here
all
is
said
the
violinist
though
by
turns
regretful
sorrowful
and
despairing
is
supreme
throughout
he
speaks
of
the
lady
of
his
song
as
the
lady
for
whose
sake
i
shall
be
strong
but
never
weak
or
diffident
again
the
supremacy
of
manhood
is
insisted
on
always
and
the
lover
though
he
entreats
implores
wonders
and
raves
as
all
lovers
do
never
forgets
his
own
dignity
he
will
take
no
affection
on
his
part
this
he
plainly
states
in
verse
of
letter
again
in
the
last
letter
of
all
he
asserts
his
mastery
and
this
is
as
it
should
be
absolute
authority
as
he
knows
is
the
way
to
win
and
to
keep
a
affections
such
lovely
fancies
as
phoebus
loosens
all
his
golden
hair
right
down
the
sky
and
daisies
turn
and
stare
at
things
we
see
not
with
our
human
wit
and
a
tuneful
noise
broke
from
the
copse
where
late
a
breeze
was
slain
and
nightingales
in
ecstacy
of
pain
did
break
their
hearts
with
singing
the
old
joys
abound
all
through
the
book
and
here
it
is
as
well
to
mark
the
decision
of
our
poet
even
in
trifles
the
breeze
he
speaks
of
is
not
or
none
of
the
usual
epithets
are
applied
to
it
it
is
as
utterly
and
as
pitifully
as
though
it
were
a
murdered
child
this
originality
of
conception
is
remarkable
and
comes
out
in
such
lines
as
i
will
unpack
my
mind
of
all
its
fears
where
the
word
is
singularly
appropriate
and
again
o
sweet
youngest
of
the
sons
of
old
king
time
whom
creation
as
men
to
where
a
daisy
grows
there
grows
a
joy
and
beautiful
and
dainty
to
a
high
degree
is
the
quaint
retrospect
where
the
lover
enthusiastically
draws
the
sun
and
moon
into
his
ecstasies
and
makes
them
seem
to
partake
in
his
admiration
of
his
lady
loveliness
a
graver
and
more
philosophic
turn
of
mind
will
be
found
in
a
song
of
servitude
and
a
rhapsody
of
death
but
judged
from
a
critical
standpoint
eric
mackay
is
a
purely
passionate
poet
straying
amongst
the
most
voluptuous
imaginings
and
sometimes
seeming
to
despise
the
joys
of
heaven
itself
for
the
sake
of
love
thus
he
lays
himself
open
to
an
accusation
of
blasphemy
from
persons
yet
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
this
respect
he
in
no
way
exceeds
the
emotions
of
romeo
and
juliet
paolo
and
francesca
da
rimini
or
any
of
those
lovers
whose
passion
has
earned
for
their
names
an
undying
celebrity
in
closing
the
present
notice
we
can
but
express
a
hope
that
this
volume
of
eric
mackay
poems
may
meet
with
the
welcome
it
deserves
from
true
lovers
of
art
for
art
includes
poetry
and
poetry
as
properly
defined
is
one
of
its
grandest
and
most
enduring
forms
some
of
the
miscellaneous
poems
in
this
collection
including
beethoven

construct
a
votive
shrine
and
fan
the
fire
and
consecrate
the
wine
and
have
a
statue
there
of
purest
gold
and
bow
thereto
unlov
and
unconsoled
but
proud
withal
to
know
the
statue
thine
for
it
were
sacrilege
to
stand
erect
and
face
to
face
within
thy
chamber
lone
to
urge
again
my
right
to
what
hath
flown
a
bygone
trust
a
passion
coldly
check
were
i
a
king
of
men
or
i
were
not
fit
to
claim
thee
as
mine
own
vi
what
am
i
then
the
sexton
of
a
joy
so
lately
slain
so
lately
on
its
bier
laid
out
in
state
i
dare
not
for
the
fear
of
this
dead
thing
regard
it
as
a
toy
it
was
a
splendid
hope
without
alloy
and
now
behold
i
greet
it
with
a
tear
vii
it
is
my
pastime
and
my
penance
too
my
pride
my
comfort
and
my
discontent
to
count
my
sorrows
ere
the
day
is
spent
and
dream
at
night
of
love
within
the
blue
of
thy
sweet
eyes
and
tremble
through
and
through
and
keep
my
house
as
one
that
doth
lament
viii
have
i
not
sinn
i
have
and
i
am
curst
and
misery
makes
the
moments
as
they
fly
harder
than
stone
and
sorrier
than
a
sigh
oh
i
did
wrong
thee
when
i
met
thee
first
and
in
my
soul
a
fantasy
was
that
seem
an
outcome
of
the
upper
sky
ix
i
thought
a
poor
musician
might
aspire
i
thought
he
might
obtain
from
thee
a
look
as
dian
self
will
smile
upon
a
brook
and
make
it
glad
though
deaf
to
its
desire
and
tinge
its
ripples
with
a
tender
fire
and
make
it
thankful
in
its
lonely
nook
i
thought
to
win
thee
ere
the
waning
days
had
caught
the
snow
ere
yet
a
word
of
mine
had
pall
upon
thee
in
the
summer
shine
and
i
was
fain
to
meet
thee
in
the
ways
of
wild
romance
and
cling
to
thee
and
gaze
between
two
kisses
on
thy
face
divine
xi
aye
on
thy
face
and
on
the
rippling
hair
that
makes
a
mantle
round
thee
in
the
night
a
royal
robe
a
network
of
the
light
which
fairies
brought
for
thee
to
keep
thee
fair
and
hide
the
glories
of
a
beauty
rare
as
those
of
sylphs
whereof
the
poets
write
xii
i
thought
by
token
of
thy
matchless
form
to
curb
thy
will
and
make
thee
mine
indeed
from
head
to
foot
there
is
no
other
creed
for
men
and
maids
in
safety
or
in
storm
than
this
of
love
repentance
may
be
warm
but
love
is
best
though
broken
like
a
reed
xiii
she
shall
be
mine
till
death
i
wildly
said
mine
and
mine
only
and
i
vow
apace
that
i
would
have
thee
in
my
yea
like
a
despot
i
would
see
thee
led
straight
to
the
altar
with
a
tear
unshed
a
wordless
woe
imprinted
on
thy
face
xiv
i
wanted
thee
i
yearned
for
thee
afar
she
shall
be
mine
i
cried
and
mine
alone
a
gorgon
grief
may
change
me
into
stone
if
i
be
baulk
i
hankered
for
a
star
and
soar
in
thought
to
where
the
angels
are
to
snatch
my
prize
beyond
the
torrid
zone
xv
i
heeded
not
the
teaching
of
the
past
i
heeded
not
the
wisdom
of
the
years
she
shall
be
mine
i
urged
till
death
appears
for
death
i
know
will
conquer
me
at
last
and
then
i
found
the
sky
was
overcast
and
then
i
felt
the
bitterness
of
tears
xvi
behold
i
thought
behold
how
fair
to
see
is
this
white
wonder
and
i
wish
thee
well
but
like
a
demon
out
of
darkest
hell
i
marr
thy
peace
and
claim
thee
on
the
plea
of
pride
and
passion
and
there
came
to
me
the
warning
of
a

a
friend
of
thine
was
walking
to
her
doom
a
who
ere
the
summer
sun
had
plied
its
course
would
weep
for
what
was
don
a
friend
of
thine
and
mine
who
in
the
gloom
of
her
own
soul
had
built
herself
a
tomb
to
tremble
there
when
tears
had
ceas
to
run
xviii
on
this
i
brooded
but
ah
not
for
this
did
i
abandon
what
i
sought
the
while
the
dear
damnation
of
thy
tender
smile
and
all
the
tortures
that
were
like
a
bliss
and
all
the
raptures
of
a
holier
kiss
than
fair
miranda
on
the
magic
isle
xix
i
urged
my
suit
my
bond
i
did
exclaim
my
pink
and
white
the
hand
i
love
to
press
the
golden
hair
that
crowns
her
loveliness
and
all
the
beauties
which
i
can
not
name
all
all
are
mine
and
i
will
have
the
same
though
she
should
hate
me
for
my
love
excess
xx
i
knew
myself
i
knew
the
withering
fate
that
would
consume
me
if
amid
my
trust
i
sued
for
hope
as
beggars
for
a
crust
o
god
i
cried
entranced
though
desolate
hallow
my
love
or
turn
it
into
hate
and
then
i
bow
in
anguish
to

dust

i
yes
i
was
mad
i
know
it
i
was
mad
for
there
is
madness
in
the
looks
of
love
and
he
who
frights
a
tender
brooding
dove
is
not
more
base
than
i
and
not
so
sad
for

had
kill
the

that
made
me
glad
and
curs
in
thought
the
sunlight
from
above

he
was
a
fool
indeed
who
lately
tried
to
touch
the
moon
in
the
trees
he
clomb
the
branches
with
his
hands
and
knees
and
craned
his
neck
to
kiss
what
he
espied
but
down
he
fell
unseemly
in
his
pride
and
told
his
follies
to
the
fitful
breeze

i
was
convicted
of
as
strange
a
thing
and
wild
as
strange
for

forlorn

fought
with
fate
but
now
the

is
torn
which
like
a
herald
in

held
aloft
the

ceased
to
sing
the
dear
old
songs
they
sang
from
morn
to

all
holy
things
avoid
me
breezes
pass
and
will
not
fan
my
cheek

once
they
did
the
gloaming
hies
away
like
one
forbid
and
day
returns
and
shadows
on

fall
from

no

give
me
pardon

the
sun

all
the
stars
that
wander
through
the

will
be
thy
sponsors

the
gladden
cry
of
one
poor
heart
will
thank
thee
for
it
soon

and
mine
amati
my
belovÃ¨d
one
the
tender
sprite
who
soothes
as
best
he
may
my
fever
pulse
and
makes
a
roundelay
of
all
my
fears
he
when
all
is
done
will
be
thy
friend
and
yield
his
place
to
none
to
wish
thee
well
and
greet
thee
day
by
day
vii
for
he
is
human
though
to
look
at
him
to
see
his
shape
to
hear
as
from
the
throat
of
some
bright
angel
his
ecstatic
note
a
sinful
soul
might
dream
of
cherubim
aye
and
he
watches
when
my
senses
swim
and
i
can
trace
the
thoughts
that
him
float
viii
often
indeed
i
tell
him
more
than
man
tells
to
woman
in
the
honied
hours
of
tranced
night
in
cities
or
in
bowers
and
more
perchance
than
lovers
in
the
span
of
absent
letters
may
with
scheming
plan
for
life
surrender
in
the
fairy
towers
ix
and
he
consoles
me
there
is
none
i
find
none
in
the
world
so
venturesome
and
wild
and
yet
withal
so
tender
true
and
mild
as
he
can
be
and
those
who
think
him
blind
are
much
to
blame
his
ways
are
ever
kind
and
he
can
plead
as
softly
as
a
child
x
and
when
he
talks
to
me
i
feel
the
touch
of
some
sweet
hope
a
feeling
of
content
almost
akin
to
what
by
joy
is
meant
and
then
i
brood
on
this
for
love
is
such
it
makes
us
weep
to
want
it
overmuch
if
wayward
fate
withhold
his
full
consent
xi
oh
come
to
me
thou
friend
of
my
desire
my
lov
amati
at
a
word
of
thine
i
can
be
brave
and
dash
away
the
brine
from
off
my
cheek
and
neutralise
the
fire
that
makes
me
mad
and
use
thee
as
a
lyre
to
curb
the
anguish
of
this
soul
of
mine
xii
wood
as
thou
art
my
treasure
with
the
strings
fair
on
thy
form
as
fits
thy
parentage

can
not
deem
that
in
a
gilded
cage
thy
spirit
lives
the
bird
that
in
thee
sings
is
not
a
mortal
no
enthralment
flings
its
charms
about
thee
like
a
poet
rage
xiii
thou
hast
no
sex
but
in
an
elfish
way
thou
dost
entwine
in
one
as
in
a
troth
the
gleesome
thoughts
of
man
and
maiden
both
thy
voice
is
fullest
at
the
flush
of
day
but
after
midnight
there
is
much
to
say
in
weird
remembrance
of
an
april
oath
xiv
and
when
the
moon
is
seated
on
the
throne
of
some
white
cloud
with
her
attendants
near
the
wondering
stars
that
hold
her
name
in
fear
oh
then
i
know
that
mine
amati
tone
is
all
for
me
and
that
he
stands
alone
first
of
his
tribe
belov
without
a
peer
xv
yea
this
is
so
my
lady
a
fair
form
made
of
the
garner
relics
of
a
tree
in
which
of
old
a
dryad
of
the
lea
did
live
and
die
he
flourish
in
a
storm
and
learnt
to
warble
when
the
days
were
warm
and
learnt
at
night
the
secrets
of
the
sea
xvi
and
now
he
is
all
mine
for
my
caress
and
my
strong
bow
an
ariel
as
it
seems
a
something
sweeter
than
the
sweetest
dreams
a
prison
wizard
that
has
come
to
bless
and
will
not
curse
though
tortured
more
or
less
by
some
remembrance
that
athwart
him

one

earth

fair

all
things

summer
in
the
air
tingled
for
thee
and
me
a
soft
reply
came
to
thy
lips
and
i
was
like
to
die
to
hear
thee
make
such
coy
confessions
there
xviii
it
was
the
dawn
of
love

so

thought
the
tender
cooing

thy

at
a

for
me

to
be
so
fraught

at

i
was
lifted
in
a
minute
space
as
nigh
to
heaven
as
heaven
is
nigh
to
thee
and
in
thy
wistful
glances
i
could
see
something
that
seem
a
joy
and
in
thy
face
a
splendour
fit
for
angels
in
the
place
where
god
has
named
them
all
in
their
degree
xx
ah
none
so
blest
as
i
and
none
so
proud
in
that
wild
moment
when
a
thrill
was
sent
right
through
my
soul
as
if
from
thee
it
went
as
flame
from
fire

this
was

sooner
wear
a

a
bird

a
wanton
woeless
thing
a
wandering
sprite

seem
to
sing
a
song
for
my
delight

far
away
did
make
its
holy

sweeter
to
hear
than
that

did
weep
thereat

my
violin

firmly

glance
straight
to

to
dance
athwart

to
rob
me

did
appear

every

had
sympathies
for
me

something
like
a

lowly
plea
did
shake
its
frame
and
something
like
a
tear
fell
on
my
cheek
to
mind
me
of
the
year
when
first
we
met
we
two
beside
the
sea
illustration
vi
i
stood
erect
i
proudly
lifted
up
the
sword

trembled

as
if

my
grief
to
are
there
not
some
who
in

choicest
cup
imbibe
despair

famish
as
they
sup
sear

solace
that
was

there
not
some
who
weep

can
not

why
it

thus

others

repeat
stories

cool
them
in

some
who
quake
for
doubts
they
can
not
quell
and
yet
are
brave
and
some
who
smile
in
hell
for
thinking
of
the
sin
that
was
so
sweet
viii
i
have
been
one
who
in
the
glow
of
youth
have
liv
in
books
and
realised
a
bliss
unfelt
by
misers
when
they
count
and
kiss
their
minted
joys
and
i
have
known
in
sooth
the
taste
of
water
from
the
well
of
truth
and
found
it
good
but
time
has
alter
this
ix
i
have
been
hated
scorn
and
thrust
away
by
one
who
is
the
regent
of
the
flowers
by
one
who
in
the
magic
of
her
powers
changes
the
day
to
night
the
night
to
day
and
makes
a
potion
of
the
solar
ray
which
drugs
my
heart
and
deadens
it
for
hours

have
been
taught
that
happiness
is
coy
and
will
not
come
to
all
who
bend
the
knee
that
faith
is
like
the
foam
upon
the
sea

pride
a
snare
and
pomp
a
foolish
toy

hope
a
moth

wings
we
may
destroy

thou

hast
made
me
feel
the
pangs
of
that
prometheus
who
was
and
would
not
bow
but
evermore
a
fierce
revolt
have
i
refused
to
kneel

it
gladly

mine
appeal
no

comes
and
none

why
then
this
rancour
why
so
cold
a
thing
as
thy
displeasure
o
thou
dearest
one

meant
no
wrong
i
stole
not
from
the
sun
the
fire
of
heaven

i
did
seek
to
bring
glory
from
thee
to
me
and
in
the
spring
i
pray
the
prayer
that
left
me
thus
undone
xiii
i
pray
my
prayer
i
wove
into
my
song
fervour
and
joy
and
mystery
and
the
bleak
the
wan
despair
that
words
can
never
speak
i
pray
as
if
my
spirit
did
belong
to
some
old
master
who
was
wise
and
strong
because
he
lov
and
suffer
and
was
weak
xiv
i
curb
the
notes
convulsive
to
a
sigh
and
when
they
falter
most
i
made
them
leap
fierce
from
my
bow
as
from
a
summer
sleep
a
young
i
was
fired
thereby
to
bolder
efforts
and
a
muffled
cry
came
from
the
strings
as
if
a
saint
did
weep
xv
i
changed
the
theme
i
dallied
with
the
bow
just
time
enough
to
fit
it
to
a
mesh
of
merry
notes
and
drew
it
back
afresh
to
talk
of
truth
and
constancy
and
woe
and
life
and
love
and
madness
and
the
glow
of
mine
own
soul
which
burns
into
my
flesh
xvi
it
was
the

how
in
the
night
a
murmur
not
unkind
broke
on

ear
a
something
new

old
quick
in
thy
breath

when

is
told

great
hope

madness
intertwined

round
my

in

seemed
to
dart
the
stings
of
kisses
warm
these
were
my

soon
would
swarm
to
choose
their
queen

ere
they
did
appear
i
heard
again
that
murmur
in
mine
ear

seem
to
speak
of
calm
before
a
storm

what
is

whispered
in

thee

own
by
night

thee

my
soul
did
leap
swiftly
to
thine

sway

i
fondled
thee

drew
thee
to
my
heart
well
knowing
in
the
dark
that
joy

dumb

then
a
cry
a
sigh

sob

come
forth

here

stand
alone
like
a

quiet

the
wing

wounded
bird

knows
it
can
not
sing

moan
but
not
a

if
we
be
sad

a
grief

grief
should
be
the
slave

not
the
king
ix
yes
i
will
pause
and
pluck
from
out
the
past
the
full
discernment
of
my
sorry
cheer
and
why
the
sunlight
seems
no
longer
clear
and
why
in
spite
of
anguish
and
the
vast
the
sickly
blank
that
my
life
is
cast
i
can
not
kneel
or
shed
a
tear
x
it
was
thy
friendship
it
was
this
i
had
this
and
no
more
i
was
a
fool
to
doubt
i
was
a
fool
to
strive
to
put
to
rout
my
many
foes
thy
musings
which
all
had
said
avoid
him
he
is
mad
mad
with
his
love

love
erratic
shout
xi
i
should
have
known
i
should
have
guess
in
time
that
like
a
soft
mirage
at
twilight
hour
my
dream
would
melt
and
rob
me
of
its
dower
i
should
have
guess
that
all
the
heights
sublime
which
look
like
spires
and
cities
built
in
rhyme
would
droop
and
die
like
petals
from
a
flower
xii
i
should
have
known
indeed
that
to
the
brave
all
things
are
servants

my
lost
delight
was
like
the
ship
that
founders
in
a
night
and
leaves
no
mark
how
then
is
passion
grave
all
that
is
left
beside
the
sobbing
wave
the
foam
thereof
the
saltness

the
blight
xiii
i
had
a
fleet
of
ships

where
are
they

all

where
the

treasured
once
an

golden

the
empire

in

lost
all
its

look
afar

saw
no

wrack

look
anear

felt
the
summer
breeze
warm
on
my
cheek

forth
upon
the
seas
i
sent
my
ships

would
not
have
them
back

some
averr
a
storm
was
on
the
track

all

the
third

a
dream

last
not

of
all
hope

content

pride
that
hath
a
fall

they

goodly
vessels

my

sails

strong
as
pinions

not

thy

why

this

so
long
brooded
on
grief

made
myself
a
bane

golden

shall
be
strong

never

was
too
shorn

did
employ
words
like
a
mourner

to
her

bow
as
one

kneel
to
glory
in
its
shroud

i
am
crown

not
so
coy
crown

a

joy

all

see

am
proud

be
sated

wildest

than
the
most
that
ecstasy
has
taught
to
saints

the

the
comfort

know
the
mighty
hills
have
much
to
tell

that
they
quake
at

talk
to
stars

so

alone

unlov

know
that
in
the
dell
flowers
are
betroth

that
a
rings
in
the
breeze

which
a
moth
has
flown

such
things

loving

me
the
world

grown
so
fair

myself

i
dreamt

i
conceiv

all
the
holy

appear

if

make
me

the
power

lead
me
out

methought
i
saw
thee
in
a
ray
of
light
this
side
a
grove
a
dream
within
a
dream
with
eyes
of
tender
pleading
and
the
gleam
of
summers
in
thy
tresses
bright

i
did
tremble
at
the
gracious
sight
as

that
it
was
good

track
thy

promptly
understood
the
fitful
blush
that
flutter
to
thy
face

i
followed
thee
to
where
a
brook
did
run
close
to
a
grot
and
there
i
knelt
to
thee
and
then
a
score
of
birds
flew
over
me
birds
which
arrived
because
the
day
was
done
to
sing
the
sanctus
of
the
setting
sun

then
i
heard
thy
voice
upon
the
lea

follow
it

i
rose
and
follow
fast

in
my
dream
i
felt
the
dream
was
true

that
full
soon
titania
with
her
crew
of
imps
and
fays
would
meet
me
on
the
blast

this
was
hindered

i
quickly
passed
into
the
valley
where
the
cedars
grew

what
a
scene
o
god
and
what
repose
and
what
sad
splendour
in
the
burning
west
a
languid
sun
to
his
rest

incense
rising
as

rose

him

i
followed
thee

came
to
where
a
shrine
stood
in
the
trees

where
an
oaken
gate
swung
in
the
air
so
turbulent

late

touch
thy
hand

into
mine

then
i
look
into
thy
face
benign

saw
the
smile

the
angels
wait

lo
the
moon
had
sailed
into
the
main

that
blue
sky

poise

then
a
tuneful
noise
broke
from
the
copse
where
late
a
breeze
was
slain

nightingales
in
ecstasy
of
pain
did
break
their
hearts

singing

it
was
the
kaiser

the
land

song

who
did
storm
the
gates

heaven

hell

man
to
whom
the
fates
were
fierce
as
furies
and
who
suffer
wrong
and
ached
and
bore
it
and
was
brave
and
strong
but
gaunt
as
ocean
when
its
rage
abates

i
knew
his
tread

knew
him
by
his
look
of
sorrow
by
his
hair
unkempt
and
torn
attire

by
his
smile
exempt
from
all
but
pleading
yet
his
body
shook
with
some
great
joy

onward
he
betook
his
echoing
steps
the
way
that
i
had
dreamt
xvii

bow
my
head
the
lordly

was

i
did

when

rais
mine
eyes
they
were
as
dim

tears
could
make
them

aghast
glared
in

a
blast

my

harken
to
the
speech
of
waves
exulting
on
the
madden
beach

sound

awful
joy

seems
to
me
a
shuddering
sound

i
walk
alone
i
see
the
bounding
waves
curl
into
foam
i
watch
them
as
they
leap
like
wild
loosen
from
the
deep

well
i
know
that
they
have
seen
the
graves

goes
down

are
loathsome

crawl
to
shore

flap
unsightly
wings

here
there
are
no
monsters

can
run
to
catch
the

the

harmless

there
is
a
glamour
all
about
the
bay
as
if
the
nymphs
of
greece
had
tarried
here
the
sands
are
golden
and
the
rocks
appear
crested
with
silver
and
the
breezes
play
snatches
of
song
they
humm
when
far
away
and
then
are
hush
as
if
from
sudden
fear
they
think
of
thee
they
hunt
they
meditate
they
will
not
quit
the
shore
till
they
have
seen
the
very
spot
where
thou
stand
serene
in
all
thy
beauty

of
me
they
prate
knowing
i
love
thee

like
one
elate
the
grand
old
sea
remembers
what
hath
been

how
many
hours
how
many
days
we
met
here
on
the
beach
in
that
delirious
time
when
all
the
waves
appear
to
break
in
rhyme
life
was
a
joy
and
love
was
like
a
debt
paid
and
repaid
in
kisses
good
to
get
and
good
to
lose
unhoarded
yet
sublime

we
wander
here
we
saw
the
tide
advance
we
saw
it
ebb
we
saw
the
widow
shore
waiting
for
ocean
with
its
organ
roar
knowing
that
day
by
day
through
happy
chance
she
would
be
wooed
anew
amid
the
dance
of
bridal
waves
as
before

and
i
remember
how
at
flush
of
morn
thou
didst
depart
alone
to
find
a
nook
where
none
could
see
thee
where
a
lover
look
were
profanation
worse
than
any
scorn
and
how
i
went
my
way
among
the
corn
to
wait
for
thee
beside
the
shepherd
brook

lo
from
out
a
cave
thou
didst
emerge
sweet
as
thyself

flower
of
womankind

was
thus
for
in
my
secret
mind
i
see
thee
now
i
see
thee
in
the
surge
of
those
wild
waves
well
knowing
that
they
urge
some
idle
wish
to
the
wind
i
think
the
beach
was
thankful
to
have
known
thy
warm
white
body
and
the
blessedness
of
thy
first
shiver
and
i
well
can
guess
how
when
thy
limbs
were
toss
and
overthrown
the
sea
was
pleased
and
every
smallest
stone
and
every
wave
was
proud
of
thy
caress

thee

thee
well

proud

thee

so
late

not

a
ballad
of
kisses
i
there
are
three
kisses
that
i
call
to
mind
and
i
will
sing
their
secrets
as
i
go
the
first
a
kiss
too
courteous
to
be
kind
was
such
a
kiss
as
monks
and
maidens
know
as
sharp
as
frost
as
blameless
as
the
snow
ii
the
second
kiss
ah
god
i
feel
it
yet
and
evermore
my
soul
will
loathe
the
same
the
toys
and
joys
of
fate
i
may
forget
but
not
the
touch
of
that
divided
shame
it
clove
my
lips
it
burnt
me
like
a
flame
iii
the
third
the
final
kiss
is
one
i
use
morning
and
noon
and
night
and
not
amiss
sorrow
be
mine
if
such
i
do
refuse
and
when
i
die
be
love
enrapt
in
bliss
in
heaven
by
such
a
kiss
mary
arden
o
thou
to
whom
athwart
the
perish
days
and
parted
nights
long
sped
we
lift
our
gaze
behold
i
greet
thee
with
a
modern
rhyme
and
reverent
as
befits
the
time
to
solemnize
the
of
thy
son
ii
and
who
was
he
who
flourish
in
the
smiles
of
thy
fair
face
was
shakespeare
of
the
isles
shakespeare
of
england
whom
the
world
has
known
as
thine
and
ours
and
glory
in
the
zone
of
all
the
seas
and
all
the
lands
of
earth
iii
he
was
when
he
came
to
thee
but
sound
and
sweet
and
good
for
eyes
to
see
and
born
at
stratford
on
george
day
a
week
before
the
wondrous
month
of
may
and
god
therein
was
gracious
to
us
all
iv
he
lov
thee
lady
and
he
lov
the
world
and
like
a
flag
his
fealty
was
unfurl
and
kings
who
flourished
ere
thy
son
was
born
shall
live
through
him
from
morn
to
furthest
morn
in
all
the
cycles
yet
to
come
he
gave
us
falstaff
and
a
hundred
quips
a
hundred
mottoes
from
immortal
lips
and
year
by
year
we
smile
to
keep
away
the
generous
tears
that
mind
us
of
the
sway
of
his
great
singing
and
the
pomp
thereof
vi
his
was
the
nectar
of
the
gods
of
greece
the
lute
of
orpheus
and
the
golden
fleece
of
grand
endeavour
and
the
of
words
majestic
which
from
pole
to
pole
have
borne
the
tidings
of
our
english
tongue
vii
he
gave
us
hamlet
and
he
taught
us
more
than
schools
have
taught
us
and
his
was
fraught
with
science
and
he
called
from
death
verona
lovers
with
the
burning
breath
of
their
great
passion
that
has
filled
the
spheres
viii
he
made
us
know
cordelia
and
the
man
who
murder
sleep
and
baleful
caliban
and
one
by
one
athwart
the
gloom
maidens
and
men
and
myths
who
were
revered
in
olden
days
before
the
earth
was
sad
ix
aye
this
is
true
it
was
ordainÃ¨d
so
he
was
thine

three
hundred

ours

ours
till
earth
be
red
with
splendour
for
the
quick
and
dead
and
days
and
nights
are
scattered
like
the
leaves
x
it
was
for
this
he
lived
for
this
he
died
to
raise
to
heaven
the
face
that
never
lied
to
lean
to
earth
the
lips
that
should
become
fraught
with
conviction
when
the
mouth
was
dumb
and
all
the
firm
fine
body
turn
to
clay
xi
he
lived
to
seal
and
sanctify
the
lives
of
perish
maids
and
uncreated
wives
and
gave
them
each
a
space
wherein
to
dwell
and
for
his
mother
sake
he
loved
them
well
and
made
them
types
undying
of
all
truth

fond
young

would

of

xiii
thou
o

perceive
prophetic
through
the
dark
and

thy

the
pride
therein
that
should
be

thine
among

thee

draw
him
back
from

thine

thee

ix
an
angel
by
direct

a
german
by
alliance
thou
didst
intone
the
which
made
despair
a
science
yea
thou
didst
strike
so
grand
a
note
that
in
its
large
vibration
it
seemed
the
roaring

give

holy

mortal

and
sinless
come

true
as
death
the
prophet
saith
and

will
have
it
so
ii
for
who
be
ye
who
doubt
and
prate
o

make
it
clear
if
ye
be
more
than
men
of
fate
or
less
than
men

if
ye
be
less
than
bird
or

it

ye
be
bankrupts

iii
you
say
there
is
no
future
state
the
clue
ye
fail
to
find
the
flesh
is
here
and
bones
appear
when
graves
are
undermined
but
of
the
soul
in
time
of
dole
what
answer
can
ye
frame
ye
who
have
heard
no
to
guide
ye
to
the
same
iv
ah
facts
are
good
and
reason
good
but
fancy
stronger
far
in
weal
or
woe
we
only
know
we
know
not
what
we
are
the
sunset
seems
a
raging
fire
the
clouds
roll
back
afraid
the
rainbow
seems
a
broken
lyre
on
which
the
storm
has
play
but
these
ye
urge
are
outward
signs
such
signs
are
not
for
you
the
sight
deceiv
and
truth
by
diamonds
of
the
dew
the
sage
mind
is
more
refined
his
rapture
more
complete
he
almost
knows
the
little
rose
that
blossoms
at
his
feet
vi
the
sage
can
kill
a
thousand
things
and
tell
the
names
of
all
and
wrench
away
the
wearied
wings
of
eagles
when
they
fall
and
calmly
trace
the
lily
grace
or
fell
the
strongest
tree
and
almost
feel
if
not
reveal
the
secrets
of
the
sea
vii
but
can
he
set
by
day
or
night
the
of
the
skies
or
bring
the
dead
man
back
to
sight
with
eyes
can
he
describe
the
ways
of
life
the
wondrous
ways
of
death
and
whence
it
came
and
what
the
flame
that
feeds
the
vital
breath
viii
if
he
could
do
such
deeds
as
these
he
might
though
poor
and
low
explain
the
cause
of
nature
laws
which
none
shall
ever
know
he
might
recall
the
vanish
years
by
lifting
of
his
hand
and
bid
the
wind
go
north
or
south
to
prove
what
he
has
plann
ix
but
god
is
just
he
burdens
not
the
shoulders
of
the
sage
he
pities
him
whose
sight
is
dim
he
turns
no
second
page
there
are
two
pages
to
the
book
we
men
have
read
the
one
the
other
needs
a
in

beyond
the

x
the
other
needs
a
poet
eye
like
that
of
milton
blind
the
light
of
faith
which
can
not
die
though
doubts
perplex
the
mind
the
eyesight
of
a
little
child
a
martyr
eye
in
dole
which
sees
afar
the
golden
star
that
shines
upon
the
soul
a
prayer
for
light
oh
give
me
light
or
let
me
die
the
light
of
love
the
of
the
sky
that
i
at
length
may
see
my
darling
face
one
minute
space
ii
have
i
not
wept
to
know
myself
so
weak
that
i
can
feel
not
see
the
dimpled
cheek
the
lips
the
eyes
the
sunbeams
that
enfold
her
locks
of
gold
iii
have
i
not
sworn
that
i
will
not
be
wed
but
mate
my
soul
with
hers

my
the
soul

see
for
souls

seraphim

oh
hush
she
comes

her
she
is
nigh
she
brings
me
death
true
heart

i
will
die
she
brings
me
love
for
love
and
life
are
one
beyond
the
sun
this
is
the
measure
this
of
all
my
joys
life
is
a
curse
and
death
a
counterpoise
give
me
thy
hand
o
sweet
one
let
me
know
which
path
i
go
vi
i
can
not

if
thou
be

lead
me
on

o
angel
with
thy
breath
kiss
me
to

mirage
i
is
a
legend
of
a
lover
is
a
ballad
to
be
sung
in
the
gloaming
under
cover
by
a
minstrel
who
is
young
by
a
singer
who
has
passion
and
who
sways
us
with
his
tongue
ii
i
who
know
it
think
upon
it
not
unhappy
tho
in
tears
and
i
gather
in
a
sonnet
all
the
glory
of
the
years
and
i
kiss
and
clasp
a
shadow
when
the
substance
disappears
iii
ah
i
see
her
as
she
faced
me
in
the
sinless
summer
days
when
her
little
hands
embraced
me
and
i
saddened
at
her
gaze
thinking
sweet
one
will
she
love
me
when
we
walk
in
other
ways
iv
will
she
cling
to
me
as
kindly
when
the
childish
faith
is
lost
will
she
pray
for
me
as
blindly
or
but
weigh
the
wish
and
cost
looking
back
on
our
lost
eden
from
the
girlhood
she
has
cross
oh
i
swear
by
all
i
honour
by
the
graves
that
i
endow
by
the
grace
i
set
upon
her
that
i
meant
the
early
vow
meant
it
much
as
men
and
women
mean
the
same
thing
spoken
now
vi
but
her
maiden
troth
is
broken
and
her
mind
is
ill
at
ease
and
she
sends
me
back
no
token
from
her
home
beyond
the
seas
and
i
know
though
nought
is
spoken
that
she
thanks
me
on
her
knees
vii
yes
for
pardon
freely
granted
for
she
wrong
me
understand
and
my
life
is
disenchanted
as
i
wander
through
the
land
with
the
sorrows
of
dark
morrows
that
await
me
in
a
band
viii
hers
was
sweetest
of
sweet
faces
hers
the
tenderest
eyes
of
all
in
her
hair
she
had
the
traces
of
a
heavenly
coronal
bringing
sunshine
to
sad
places
where
the
sunlight
could
not
fall
ix
she
was
fairer
than
a
vision
like
a
vision
too
has
flown
i
who
flushed
at
her
decision
lo
i
languish
here
alone
and
i
tremble
when
i
tell
you
that
my
anger
was
mine
own
x
not
for
her
sweet
sainted
creature
could
i
curse
her
to
her
face
could
i
look
on
form
and
feature
and
deny
the
inner
grace
like
a
little
wax
madonna
she
was
holy
in
the
place
xi
and
i
told
her
in
mad
fashion
that
i
loved
her
would
incline
all
my
life
to
this
one
passion
and
would
kneel
as
at
a
shrine
and
would
love
her
late
and
early
and
would
teach
her
to
be
mine
xii
now
in
dreams
alone
i
meet
her
with
my
lowly
human
praise
she
is
sweeter
and
completer
and
she
smiles
on
me
always
but
i
dare
not
rise
and
greet
her
as
i
did
in
early
days
illustration
a
mother
name
i
love
the
sound
the
sweetest
under
heaven
that
name
of
mother
and
the
proudest
too
as
babes
we
breathe
it
and
with
seven
times
seven
of
youthful
prayers
and
blessings
that
accrue
we
still
repeat
the
word
with
tender
steven
dearest
of
friends
dear
mother
what
we
do
this
side
the
grave
in
purity
of
aim
is
glorified
at
last
by
thy
good
name
ii
but
how
forlorn
the
word
how
full
of
woe
when
she
who
bears
it
lies
beneath
the
clod
in
vain
the
orphan
child
would
call
her
so
she
comes
not
back
her
place
is
up
with
god
the
wintry
winds
are
wailing
the
snow
the
flowers
are
dead
that
once
did
grace
the
sod
ah
lose
not
heart
some
flowers
may
fade
in
gloom
but
hope
a
plant
grows
brightest
on
the
tomb
a
song
of
servitude
i
this
is
a
song
of
serfs
that
i
have
made
a
song
of
sympathy
for
grief
and
joy
the
old
the
young
the
lov
and
the
betrayed
all
all
must
serve
for
all
must
be
obeyed
ii
there
are
no
tyrants
but
the
serving
ones
there
are
no
servants
but
the
ruling
men
the
captain
conquers
with
his
army
guns
but
he
himself
is
conquered
by
his
sons
iii
what
is
a
parent
but
a
daughter
slave
a
son
retainer
when
the
lad
is
ill
the
great
creator
loves
the
good
and
brave
and
makes
a
flower
the
spokesman
of
a
grave
iv
the
son
is
servant
in
his
father
halls
the
daughter
is
her
mother
the
welkin
wonders
when
the
ocean
calls
and
earth
accepts
the
raindrop
when
it
falls
there
are
no
ups
in
life
there
are
no
downs
for
high
and
low
are
words
of
like
degree
he
who
is
light
of
heart
when
fortune
frowns
he
is
a
king
though
nameless
in
the
towns
vi
none
is
so
lofty
as
the
sage
who
prays
none
so
unhigh
as
he
who
will
not
kneel
the
breeze
is
servant
to
the
summer
days
and
he
is
most
who
most
obeys
vii
these
are
the
maxims
that
i
take
to
heart
do
thou
accept
them
reader
for
thine
own
love
well
thy
work
be
truthful
in
the
mart
and
foes
will
praise
thee
when
thy

depart
viii
none
shall
upbraid
thee
then
for
thine
estate
or
show
thee
meaner
than
thou
art
in
truth
make
friends
with
death

god
who
is
so
great

will
assist
thee

fate
ix
none
are
unfit
to
serve
upon
their
knees
the
saints
of
prayer
unseen
but
quick
to
hear
the
flowers
are
servants
to
the
pilgrim
bees

are
tyrants

all

incur

debt

all

pay

set

the
laws

would
forget
xi
there
are
no
mockeries
in
the
universe
no
false
accounts
no
errors
that
will
thrive
the
work
we
do
the
good
things
we

xiii
is
not

the
crown
that
makes
the
king
is
service
done

duty
to
his

the
lark
that
soars
so
high

what

can
not

pangs
i
feel
if
prayers
could
alter
night
to
day

black
to
white
i
might
appeal
i
might
attempt

sway
thy
heart

prove
it
mine

claim
a

on
thee
at

the
chance

some
redress

to
make
my
sorrows

might
indeed
be

thou

stone

a

thou
a
man
may
hear
thy
bosom
beat

sworn
some
idle
vow

not
for

no
not
for
this

thou
wilt
sell
thy
bridal
kiss

thy

will
sell
thy

doubt
he
find
his
bargain
dear
he
lose
the
wine
he
buy
the
bowl
the
life
the
limbs
but
not
the
soul
so
take
thy
mate

all
his
wealth
and
all
the
joys
that
wait
on
fame
weep
poor
martyr
one
by
stealth
and
think
of
me
and
shriek
my
name
yes
in
his
arms
and
wake
too
late
to
coax
and
kiss
the
man
you
hate
vi
by
slow
degrees
from
year
to
year
from
week

from
night
to
night
he
will
be
taught
how
dark

drear
is
barter
love
how
sad

sight
a
perjured
face
he
will
be
driven
to
compass
hell

stand
at

match
thy
pride

drag
thee
down
from
glory
seat

thou
shalt
kneel
thy
head
shall
bow
as
mine

bent
in
anguish
now

what
for
thy

have
i
forsworn
my

all
my

all
my

school
my

be
hard
as

melt
at
length

curb
my

thine
is

oh
doubt
not

at

curse
thee
twice

swoops
the

out

curse
thee
thrice

thou
shalt
hear
aye
by

troth
one
song

suit
the
souls

both

i
curse
thy
face
i

thy

well
thy

my
despair
my
loveless
couch
thy
my
soul

thine

take
one
half
my
curses
back

thou
my

be
kill
and
hid
from
ken

fiends
will
sing
thy
requiem
then
xiv
yet
think
not
death
will
serve
thy
stead
i
find
thy
grave
though
wall
in
stone
i
move
thy
mould

make
my

lie
with
thee
long
hours

long
lifeless

ah
god
how
free
how
pale
how
cold
thy
lips
will
be

graves

men
may
talk
no
treason
there
a
corpse

wear
no

ghost

make
no

ghosts
can
pray
well
let
them
kneel
they
too
must
loathe
the
love
they
feel
xvi
ah
me
to
sleep
and
yet
to
wake
to
live
so
long

yet
to
die

sing
sad
songs

no

throb

thee
spotless

thee

thee

thee

me
thou

set
at

keeps
the

so
fair

sweet

a
golden

something
wild

strange

true
a
fairy

an
angel

merge
them
all
in
thy
renown

give
thee
queens

thee

kneel
to
thee

by

thy

thee
homage
all

this
