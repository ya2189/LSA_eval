the
pilot
story
i
it
was
a
story
the
pilot
told
with
his
back
to
his
hearers
keeping
his
hand
on
the
wheel
and
his
eye
on
the
globe
of
the
holding
the
boat
to
the
shore
and
out
of
the
sweep
of
the
current
lightly
turning
aside
for
the
heavy
logs
of
the
widely
shunning
the
snags
that
made
us
sardonic
obeisance
ii
all
the
soft
damp
air
was
full
of
delicate
perfume
from
the
young
willows
in
bloom
on
either
bank
of
the
river
faint
delicious
fragrance
trancing
the
indolent
senses
in
a
luxurious
dream
of
the
river
and
land
of
the
lotus
not
yet
out
of
the
west
the
roses
of
sunset
were
withered
in
the
deep
blue
above
light
clouds
of
gold
and
of
crimson
floated
in
slumber
serene
and
the
restless
river
beneath
them
rushed
away
to
the
sea
with
a
vision
of
rest
in
its
bosom
far
on
the
eastern
shore
lay
dimly
the
swamps
of
the
cypress
dimly
before
us
the
islands
grew
from
the
river
expanses
beautiful
isles
with
the
gleam
of
the
swart
inundation
seen
through
the
swaying
boughs
and
slender
trunks
of
their
willows
and
on
the
shore
beside
us
the
rose
in
the
evening
yearningly
wearily
with
the
inscrutable
sadness
of
the
mute
races
of
trees
while
hoarsely
the
steam
from
her
shouted
then
whispered
a
moment
then
shouted
again
to
the
silence
trembling
through
all
her
frame
with
the
mighty
pulse
of
her
engines
slowly
the
boat
ascended
the
swollen
and
broad
mississippi
sweeping
on
with
tangled
masses
of
daintily
breathed
about
with
whiffs
of
silvery
vapor
where
in
his
arrowy
flight
the
twittering
swallow
alighted
and
the
belated
blackbird
paused
on
the
way
to
its
nestlings
iii
it
was
the
pilot
story
they
both
came
aboard
there
at
cairo
from
a
new
orleans
boat
and
took
passage
with
us
for
saint
louis
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
with
just
enough
blood
from
her
mother
darkening
her
eyes
and
her
hair
to
make
her
race
known
to
a
trader
you
would
have
thought
she
was
white
the
man
that
was
with
her
you
see
such
weakly
and
kind
and
weakly
and
vicious
slender
of
body
and
soul
fit
neither
for
loving
nor
hating
i
was
a
youngster
then
and
only
learning
the
river
not
of
the
wheel
i
used
to
watch
them
at
monte
down
in
the
cabin
at
night
and
learned
to
know
all
of
the
gamblers
so
when
i
saw
this
weak
one
staking
his
money
against
them
betting
upon
the
turn
of
the
cards
i
knew
what
was
coming
never
left
their
pigeons
a
single
feather
to
fly
with
next
day
i
saw
them
together
the
stranger
and
one
of
the
gamblers
picturesque
rascal
he
was
with
long
black
hair
and
moustaches
black
slouch
hat
drawn
down
to
his
eyes
from
his
villanous
forehead
on
together
they
moved
still
earnestly
talking
in
whispers
on
toward
the
forecastle
where
sat
the
woman
alone
by
the
gangway
roused
by
the
fall
of
feet
she
turned
and
beholding
her
master
greeted
him
with
a
smile
that
was
more
like
a
wife
than
another
rose
to
meet
him
fondly
and
then
with
the
dread
apprehension
always
haunting
the
slave
fell
her
eye
on
the
face
of
the
gambler
dark
and
lustful
and
fierce
and
full
of
merciless
cunning
something
was
spoken
so
low
that
i
could
not
hear
what
the
words
were
only
the
woman
started
and
looked
from
one
to
the
other
with
imploring
eyes
bewildered
hands
and
a
tremor
all
through
her
frame
i
saw
her
from
where
i
was
standing
she
shook
so
is
it
so
she
cried
on
the
weak
white
lips
of
her
master
died
a
sickly
smile
and
he
said
i
have
sold
you
god
is
my
judge
may
i
never
see
such
a
look
of
despairing
desolate
anguish
as
that
which
the
woman
cast
on
her
master
griping
her
breast
with
her
little
hands
as
if
he
had
stabbed
her
standing
in
silence
a
space
as
fixed
as
the
indian
woman
carved
out
of
wood
on
the
of
the
old
pocahontas
then
with
a
gurgling
moan
like
the
sound
in
the
throat
of
the
dying
came
back
her
voice
that
rising
fluttered
through
wild
incoherence
into
a
terrible
shriek
that
stopped
my
heart
while
she
answered
me
sold
me
sold
and
you
promised
to
give
me
my
freedom
promised
me
for
the
sake
of
our
little
boy
in
saint
louis
what
will
you
say
to
our
boy
when
he
cries
for
me
there
in
saint
louis
what
will
you
say
to
our
god
ah
you
have
been
joking
i
see
it
no
god
god
he
shall
hear
it
and
all
of
the
angels
in
heaven
even
the
devils
in
hell
and
none
will
believe
when
they
hear
it
sold
me
her
voice
died
away
with
a
wail
and
in
silence
down
she
sank
on
the
deck
and
covered
her
face
with
her
fingers
iv
in
his
story
a
moment
the
pilot
paused
while
we
listened
to
the
salute
of
a
boat
that
rounding
the
point
of
an
island
flamed
toward
us
with
fires
that
seemed
to
burn
from
the
waters
stately
and
vast
and
swift
and
borne
on
the
heart
of
the
current
then
with
the
mighty
voice
of
a
giant
challenged
to
battle
rose
the
responsive
whistle
and
all
the
echoes
of
island
glade
and
brake
replied
with
a
myriad
clamor
like
wild
birds
that
are
suddenly
startled
from
slumber
at
midnight
then
were
at
peace
once
more
and
we
heard
the
harsh
cries
of
the
peacocks
perched
on
a
tree
by
a
where
the
children
stood
to
look
at
the
boat
as
it
passed
them
passed
them
so
near
that
we
heard
their
happy
talk
and
their
laughter
softly
the
sunset
had
faded
and
now
on
the
eastern
horizon
hung
like
a
tear
in
the
sky
the
beautiful
star
of
the
evening
still
with
his
back
to
us
standing
the
pilot
went
on
with
his
story
all
of
us
flocked
round
the
woman
the
children
cried
and
their
mothers
hugged
them
tight
to
their
breasts
but
the
gambler
said
to
the
captain
me
off
there
at
the
town
that
lies
round
the
bend
of
the
river
here
you
rise
at
once
and
be
ready
now
to
go
with
me
roughly
he
seized
the
woman
arm
and
strove
to
uplift
her
she
she
seemed
not
to
heed
him
but
rose
like
one
that
is
dreaming
slid
from
his
grasp
and
fleetly
mounted
the
steps
of
the
gangway
up
to
the
in
silence
without
lamentation
straight
to
the
stern
of
the
boat
where
the
wheel
was
she
ran
and
the
people
followed
her
fast
till
she
turned
and
stood
at
bay
for
a
moment
looking
them
in
the
face
and
in
the
face
of
the
gambler
not
one
to
save
her
not
one
of
all
the
compassionate
people
not
one
to
save
her
of
all
the
pitying
angels
in
heaven
not
one
bolt
of
god
to
strike
him
dead
there
before
her
wildly
she
waved
him
back
we
waiting
in
silence
and
horror
over
the
swarthy
face
of
the
gambler
a
pallor
of
passion
passed
like
a
gleam
of
lightning
over
the
west
in
the
white
she
stood
and
mute
till
he
put
forth
his
hand
to
secure
her
then
she
turned
and
leaped
in
fluttered
a
moment
down
then
whirling
fell
like
a
bird
from
a
down
on
the
cruel
wheel
that
caught
her
and
hurled
her
and
crushed
her
and
in
the
foaming
water
plunged
her
and
hid
her
forever
vi
still
with
his
back
to
us
all
the
pilot
stood
but
we
heard
him
swallowing
hard
as
he
pulled
the
for
stopping
then
turning
this
is
the
place
where
it
happened
brokenly
whispered
the
pilot
somehow
i
never
like
to
go
by
here
alone
in
the
darkly
the
mississippi
flowed
by
the
town
that
lay
in
the
starlight
cheerful
with
lamps
below
we
could
hear
them
reversing
the
engines
and
the
great
boat
glided
up
to
the
shore
like
a
giant
exhausted
heavily
sighed
her
pipes
broad
over
the
swamps
to
the
eastward
shone
the
full
moon
and
turned
our
wake
into
silver
all
was
serene
and
calm
but
the
odorous
breath
of
the
willows
smote
with
a
mystical
sense
of
infinite
sorrow
upon
us
forlorn
i
red
roses
in
the
slender
vases
burning
breathed
all
upon
the
air
the
passion
and
the
tenderness
and
yearning
the
waiting
and
the
doubting
and
despair
ii
still
with
the
music
of
her
voice
was
haunted
through
all
its
charméd
rhymes
the
open
book
of
such
a
one
as
chanted
the
things
he
dreamed
in
old
old
iii
the
silvern
chords
of
the
piano
trembled
still
with
the
music
wrung
from
them
the
silence
of
the
room
dissembled
the
closes
of
the
songs
that
she
had
sung
iv
the
languor
of
the
crimson
shawl
abasement
lying
without
a
stir
upon
the
floor
the
absence
at
the
casement
the
solitude
and
hush
were
full
of
her
without
and
going
from
the
room
and
never
departing
did
depart
her
steps
and
one
that
came
too
late
forever
felt
them
go
heavy
his
broken
heart
vi
and
sitting
in
the
house
desolation
he
could
not
bear
the
gloom
the
vanishing
encounter
and
evasion
of
things
that
were
and
were
not
in
the
room
vii
through
midnight
streets
he
followed
fleeting
visions
of
faces
and
of
forms
he
heard
old
tendernesses
and
derisions
amid
the
sobs
and
cries
of
midnight
storms
viii
by
midnight
lamps
and
from
the
darkness
under
that
lamps
made
at
their
feet
he
saw
sweet
eyes
peer
out
in
innocent
wonder
and
sadly
follow
after
him
down
the
street
ix
the
noonday
crowds
their
restlessness
obtruded
between
him
and
his
quest
at
unseen
corners
jostled
and
eluded
against
his
hand
her
silken
robes
were
pressed
x
doors
closed
upon
her
out
of
garret
casements
he
knew
she
looked
at
him
in
splendid
mansions
and
in
squalid
basements
upon
the
walls
he
saw
her
shadow
swim
xi
from
rapid
carriages
she
gleamed
upon
him
whirling
away
from
sight
from
all
the
hopelessness
of
search
she
won
him
back
to
the
dull
and
lonesome
house
at
night
xii
full
early
into
dark
the
twilights
saddened
within
its
closéd
doors
the
echoes
with
the
clock
monotony
maddened
leaped
loud
in
welcome
from
the
hollow
floors
xiii
but
gusts
that
blew
all
day
with
solemn
laughter
from
and
the
strange
noises
between
roof
and
rafter
the
wainscot
clamor
and
the
scampering
races
xiv
of
mice
that
chased
each
other
through
the
chambers
and
up
and
down
the
stair
and
rioted
among
the
ashen
embers
and
left
their
frolic
footprints
everywhere
xv
were
hushed
to
hear
his
heavy
tread
ascending
the
broad
steps
one
by
one
and
toward
the
solitary
chamber
tending
where
the
dim
phantom
of
his
hope
alone
xvi
rose
up
to
meet
him
with
his
growing
nearer
eager
for
his
embrace
and
moved
and
melted
into
the
white
mirror
and
stared
at
him
with
his
own
haggard
face
xvii
but
turning
he
was
looks
beheld
him
out
of
the
mirror
white
and
at
the
window
yearning
arms
she
held
him
out
of
the
vague
and
sombre
fold
of
night
xviii
sometimes
she
stood
behind
him
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
he
read
sometimes
he
felt
her
shadowy
presence
hover
above
his
dreamful
sleep
beside
his
bed
xix
and
rising
from
his
sleep
her
shadowy
presence
followed
his
light
descent
of
the
long
stair
her
shadowy
evanescence
through
all
the
whispering
rooms
before
him
went
xx
upon
the
earthy
draught
of
cellars
blowing
his
shivering
blue
amid
the
damp
and
chill
he
felt
her
flowing
around
him
from
the
doors
he
entered
through
xxi
the
spiders
wove
their
webs
upon
the
ceiling
the
bat
clung
to
the
wall
the
dry
leaves
through
the
open
transom
stealing
skated
and
danced
adown
the
empty
hall
xxii
about
him
closed
the
utter
desolation
about
him
closed
the
gloom
the
vanishing
encounter
and
evasion
of
things
that
were
and
were
not
in
the
room
xxiii
vexed
him
forever
and
his
life
forever
immured
and
desolate
beating
itself
with
desperate
endeavor
but
bruised
itself
against
the
round
of
fate
xxiv
the
roses
in
their
slender
vases
burning
were
quenchéd
long
before
a
dust
was
on
the
rhymes
of
love
and
yearning
the
shawl
was
like
a
shroud
upon
the
floor
xxv
her
music
from
the
thrilling
chords
had
perished
the
stillness
was
not
moved
with
memories
of
cadences
long
cherished
the
closes
of
the
songs
that
she
had
loved
xxvi
but
not
the
less
he
felt
her
presence
never
out
of
the
room
depart
over
the
threshold
not
the
less
forever
he
felt
her
going
on
his
broken
heart

i
full
of
beautiful
blossoms
stood
the
tree
in
early
may
came
a
chilly
gale
from
the
sunset
and
blew
the
blossoms
away
scattered
them
through
the
garden
tossed
them
into
the
mere
the
sad
tree
moaned
and
shuddered
alas
the
fall
is
here
but
all
through
the
glowing
summer
the
blossomless
tree
throve
fair
and
the
fruit
waxed
ripe
and
mellow
with
sunny
rain
and
air
and
when
the
dim
october
with
golden
death
was
crowned
under
its
heavy
branches
the
tree
stooped
to
the
ground
in
youth
there
comes
a
blowing
our
bloom
away
a
chilly
breath
of
autumn
out
of
the
lips
of
may
we
bear
the
ripe
fruit
after
ah
me
for
the
thought
of
pain
we
know
the
sweetness
and
beauty
and
the
never
again
ii
one
sails
away
to
sea
one
stands
on
the
shore
and
cries
the
ship
goes
down
the
world
and
the
light
on
the
sullen
water
dies
the
whispering
shell
is
mute
and
after
is
evil
cheer
she
shall
stand
on
the
shore
and
cry
in
vain
many
and
many
a
year
but
the
stately
ship
lies
wrecked
on
the
unknown
deep
far
under
dead
in
his
coral
bed
the
lover
lies
asleep
iii
through
the
silent
streets
of
the
city
in
the
night
unbusy
noon
up
and
down
in
the
pallor
of
the
languid
summer
moon
i
wander
and
think
of
the
village
and
the
house
in
the
and
the
porch
with
the
honeysuckles
and
the
all
abloom
my
soul
is
sick
with
the
fragrance
of
the
dewy
breath
o
darling
the
house
is
empty
and
lonesomer
than
death
if
i
call
no
one
will
answer
if
i
knock
no
one
will
come
the
feet
are
at
rest
forever
and
the
lips
are
cold
and
dumb
the
summer
moon
is
shining
so
wan
and
large
and
still
and
the
weary
dead
are
sleeping
in
the
graveyard
under
the
hill
iv
we
looked
at
the
wide
white
circle
around
the
autumn
moon
and
talked
of
the
change
of
weather
it
would
rain
or
soon
and
the
rain
came
on
the
morrow
and
beat
the
dying
leaves
from
the
shuddering
boughs
of
the
maples
into
the
flooded
eaves
the
clouds
wept
out
their
sorrow
but
in
my
heart
the
tears
are
bitter
for
want
of
weeping
in
all
these
autumn
years
the
bobolink
sings
in
the
meadow
the
wren
in
the
come
hither
thou
little
maiden
and
sit
upon
my
knee
and
i
will
tell
thee
a
story
i
read
in
a
book
of
rhyme
i
will
but
fain
that
it
happened
to
me
one
when
we
walked
through
the
meadow
and
she
and
i
were
young
the
story
is
old
and
weary
with
being
said
and
sung
the
story
is
old
and
weary
ah
child
it
is
known
to
thee
who
was
it
that
last
night
kissed
thee
under
the
vi
like
a
bird
of
evil
presage
to
the
lonely
house
on
the
shore
came
the
wind
with
a
tale
of
shipwreck
and
shrieked
at
the
bolted
door
and
flapped
its
wings
in
the
gables
and
shouted
the
names
and
buffeted
the
windows
afeard
in
their
shuddering
frames
it
was
night
and
it
is
morning
the
summer
sun
is
bland
the
waves
come
rocking
rocking
in
to
the
summer
land
the
waves
come
rocking
rocking
in
the
sun
so
soft
and
bright
and
toss
and
play
with
the
dead
man
drowned
in
the
storm
last
night
vii
i
remember
the
burning
brushwood
glimmering
all
day
long
yellow
and
weak
in
the
sunlight
now
leaped
up
red
and
strong
and
fired
the
old
dead
chestnut
that
all
our
years
had
stood
gaunt
and
gray
and
ghostly
apart
from
the
sombre
wood
and
flushed
with
sudden
summer
the
leafless
boughs
on
high
blossomed
in
dreadful
beauty
against
the
darkened
sky
we
children
sat
telling
stories
and
boasting
what
we
should
be
when
we
were
men
like
our
fathers
and
watched
the
blazing
tree
that
showered
its
fiery
blossoms
like
a
rain
of
stars
we
said
of
crimson
and
azure
and
purple
that
night
when
i
lay
in
bed
i
could
not
sleep
for
seeing
whenever
i
closed
my
eyes
the
tree
in
its
dazzling
splendor
against
the
darkened
skies
i
can
not
sleep
for
seeing
with
closéd
eyes
the
tree
in
its
dazzling
splendor
dropping
its
blossoms
bright
and
old
old
dreams
of
childhood
come
thronging
my
weary
brain
dear
foolish
beliefs
and
longings
i
doubt
are
they
real
again
it
is
nothing
and
nothing
and
nothing
that
i
either
think
or
see
the
phantoms
of
dead
illusions
are
haunting
me
in
august
all
the
long
august
afternoon
the
little
drowsy
stream
whispers
a
melancholy
tune
as
if
it
dreamed
of
june
and
whispered
in
its
dream
the
thistles
show
beyond
the
brook
dust
on
their
down
and
bloom
and
out
of
many
a
nook
the
look
with
eyes
of
tender
gloom
the
silent
orchard
aisles
are
sweet
with
smell
of
ripening
fruit
through
the
sere
grass
in
shy
retreat
flutter
at
coming
feet
the
robins
strange
and
mute
there
is
no
wind
to
stir
the
leaves
the
harsh
leaves
overhead
only
the
querulous
cricket
grieves
and
shrilling
locust
weaves
a
song
of
summer
dead
the
empty
house
the
wet
trees
hang
above
the
walks
purple
with
damps
and
earthish
stains
and
strewn
by
moody
absent
rains
with
from
the
stalks
unmown
in
heavy
tangled
swaths
the
ripe
is
wanton
blown
snails
slime
the
untrodden
along
the
sills
hang
drowsy
moths
down
the
blank
visage
of
the
wall
where
many
a
wavering
trace
appears
like
a
forgotten
trace
of
tears
from
swollen
eaves
the
slow
drops
crawl
where
everything
was
wide
before
the
curious
wind
that
comes
and
goes
finds
all
the
latticed
windows
close
secret
and
close
the
bolted
door
and
with
the
shrewd
and
curious
wind
that
in
the
archéd
doorway
cries
and
at
the
bolted
portal
tries
and
harks
and
listens
at
the
blind
forever
lurks
my
thought
about
and
in
the
ghostly
finds
all
the
hidden
windows
bright
and
sees
the
guests
go
in
and
out
and
lingers
till
the
pallid
dawn
and
feels
the
mystery
deeper
there
in
silent
chambers
bare
with
all
the
midnight
revel
gone
but
wanders
through
the
lonesome
rooms
where
harsh
the
astonished
cricket
calls
and
from
the
hollows
of
the
walls
vanishing
start
unshapen
glooms
and
lingers
yet
and
can
not
come
out
of
the
drear
and
desolate
place
so
full
of
ruin
solemn
grace
and
haunted
with
the
ghost
of
home
bubbles
i
stood
on
the
brink
in
childhood
and
watched
the
bubbles
go
from
the
sunny
ripple
to
the
smoother
tide
below
and
over
the
white
under
them
every
one
went
golden
stars
in
the
water
all
luminous
with
the
sun
but
the
bubbles
broke
on
the
surface
and
under
the
stars
of
gold
broke
and
the
hurrying
water
flowed
onward
swift
and
cold
ii
i
stood
on
the
brink
in
manhood
and
it
came
to
my
weary
brain
and
my
heart
so
dull
and
heavy
after
the
years
of
pain
that
every
hollowest
bubble
which
over
my
life
had
passed
still
into
its
deeper
current
some
heavenly
gleam
had
cast
that
however
i
mocked
it
gayly
and
guessed
at
its
hollowness
still
shone
with
each
bursting
bubble
one
star
in
my
soul
the
less
lost
beliefs
one
after
one
they
left
us
the
sweet
birds
out
of
our
breasts
went
flying
away
in
the
morning
will
they
come
again
to
their
nests
will
they
come
again
at
nightfall
with
god
breath
in
their
song
noon
is
fierce
with
the
heats
of
summer
and
summer
days
are
long
o
my
life
with
thy
upward
liftings
thy
roots
ripening
out
of
thy
tender
blossoms
but
hard
and
bitter
fruits
in
thy
boughs
there
is
no
shelter
for
the
birds
to
seek
again
the
desolate
nest
is
broken
and
torn
with
storms
and
rain
louis

conversion
yesterday
while
i
moved
with
the
languid
crowd
on
the
riva
musing
with
idle
eyes
on
the
wide
lagoons
and
the
islands
and
on
the
seaward
glimmering
sails
in
the
distance
where
the
azure
haze
like
a
vision
of
haunted
the
dreamy
sky
of
the
soft
venetian
december
while
i
moved
unwilled
in
the
mellow
warmth
of
the
weather
breathing
air
that
was
full
of
old
world
sadness
and
beauty
into
my
thought
came
this
story
of
free
wild
life
in
ohio
when
the
land
was
new
and
yet
by
the
beautiful
river
dwelt
the
pioneers
and
indian
hunters
and
boatmen
pealed
from
the
campanili
responding
from
island
to
island
bells
of
that
ancient
faith
whose
incense
and
solemn
devotions
rise
from
a
hundred
shrines
in
the
broken
heart
of
the
city
but
in
my
revery
heard
i
only
the
passionate
voices
of
the
people
that
sang
in
the
virgin
heart
of
the
forest
autumn
was
in
the
land
and
the
trees
were
golden
and
crimson
and
from
the
luminous
boughs
of
the
and
the
maples
tender
and
beautiful
fell
the
light
in
the
worshippers
faces
softer
than
lights
that
stream
through
the
saints
on
the
windows
of
churches
while
the
balsamy
breath
of
the
hemlocks
and
pines
by
the
river
stole
on
the
winds
through
the
woodland
aisles
like
the
breath
of
a
censer
loud
the
people
sang
old
anthems
that
quaver
quaintly
yet
from
lips
forgetful
of
lips
that
have
kissed
them
loud
they
sang
the
songs
of
the
sacrifice
and
atonement
and
of
the
end
of
the
world
and
the
infinite
terrors
of
judgment
songs
of
ineffable
sorrow
and
wailing
compassionate
warning
unto
the
generations
that
hardened
their
hearts
to
their
savior
songs
of
exultant
rapture
for
them
that
confessed
him
and
followed
bearing
his
burden
and
yoke
enduring
and
entering
with
him
into
the
rest
of
his
saints
and
the
endless
reward
of
the
blessed
loud
the
people
sang
but
through
the
sound
of
their
singing
broke
inarticulate
cries
and
moans
and
sobs
from
the
mourners
as
the
glory
of
god
that
smote
the
apostle
of
tarsus
smote
them
and
strewed
them
to
earth
like
leaves
in
the
breath
of
the
whirlwind
hushed
at
last
was
the
sound
of
the
lamentation
and
singing
but
from
the
distant
hill
the
throbbing
drum
of
the
pheasant
shook
with
its
heavy
pulses
the
depths
of
the
listening
silence
when
from
his
place
arose
a
exhorter
and
faltered
brethren
and
sisters
in
jesus
the
lord
hath
heard
our
petitions
so
that
the
hearts
of
his
servants
are
awed
and
melted
within
them
even
the
hearts
of
the
wicked
are
touched
by
his
infinite
mercy
all
my
days
in
this
vale
of
tears
the
lord
hath
been
with
me
he
hath
been
good
to
me
he
hath
granted
me
trials
and
patience
but
this
hour
hath
crowned
my
knowledge
of
him
and
his
goodness
truly
but
that
it
is
well
this
day
for
me
to
be
with
you
now
might
i
say
to
the
lord
know
thee
my
god
in
all
fulness
now
let
thy
servant
depart
in
peace
to
the
rest
thou
hast
promised
faltered
and
ceased
and
now
the
wild
and
jubilant
music
of
the
singing
burst
from
the
solemn
profound
of
the
silence
surged
in
triumph
and
fell
and
ebbed
again
into
silence
then
from
the
group
of
the
preachers
arose
the
greatest
among
them
he
whose
days
were
given
in
youth
to
the
praise
of
the
savior
he
whose
lips
seemed
touched
like
the
prophet
of
old
from
the
altar
so
that
his
words
were
flame
and
burned
to
the
hearts
of
his
hearers
quickening
the
dead
among
them
reviving
the
cold
and
the
doubting
there
he
charged
them
pray
and
rest
not
from
prayer
while
a
sinner
in
the
sound
of
their
voices
denied
the
friend
of
the
sinner
pray
till
the
night
shall
fall
till
the
stars
are
faint
in
the
morning
yea
till
the
sun
himself
be
faint
in
that
glory
and
brightness
faint
in
the
light
which
shall
dawn
in
mercy
for
penitent
sinners
kneeling
he
led
them
in
prayer
and
the
quick
and
sobbing
responses
spake
how
their
souls
were
moved
with
the
might
and
the
grace
of
the
spirit
then
while
the
converts
recounted
how
god
had
chastened
and
saved
them
children
whose
golden
locks
yet
shone
with
the
lingering
effulgence
of
the
touches
of
him
who
blessed
little
children
forever
old
men
whose
yearning
eyes
were
dimmed
with
the
brightness
seen
through
the
opening
gates
in
the
heart
of
the
heavenly
city
stealthily
through
the
harking
woods
the
lengthening
shadows
chased
the
wild
things
to
their
nests
and
the
twilight
died
into
darkness
now
the
four
great
pyres
that
were
placed
there
to
light
the
encampment
high
on
platforms
raised
above
the
people
were
kindled
flaming
aloof
as
it
were
the
pillar
by
night
in
the
desert
fell
their
crimson
light
on
the
lifted
orbs
of
the
preachers
fell
on
the
withered
brows
of
the
old
men
and
israel
mothers
fell
on
the
bloom
of
youth
and
the
earnest
devotion
of
manhood
fell
on
the
anguish
and
hope
in
the
tearful
eyes
of
the
mourners
flaming
aloof
it
stirred
the
sleep
of
the
luminous
maples
with
warm
and
faint
luxurious
languor
near
the
four
great
pyres
the
people
closed
in
a
circle
in
their
midst
the
mourners
and
praying
with
them
the
exhorters
and
on
the
skirts
of
the
circle
the
unrepentant
and
scorners
ever
fewer
and
sadder
and
drawn
to
the
place
of
the
mourners
one
after
one
by
the
prayers
and
tears
of
the
brethren
and
sisters
and
by
the
spirit
of
god
that
was
mightily
striving
within
them
till
at
the
last
alone
stood
louis

unconverted
louis

the
boatman
the
trapper
the
hunter
the
fighter
from
the
unlucky
french
of
gallipolis
he
descended
heir
to
old
world
want
and
new
world
love
of
adventure
vague
was
the
life
he
led
and
vague
and
grotesque
were
the
rumors
through
which
he
loomed
on
the
people
the
hero
of
mythical
hearsay
quick
of
hand
and
of
heart
impatient
generous
western
taking
the
thought
of
the
young
in
secret
love
and
in
envy
not
less
the
elders
shook
their
heads
and
held
him
for
outcast
reprobate
roving
ungodly
infidel
worse
than
a
papist
with
his
whispered
fame
of
lawless
exploits
at
louis
wild
affrays
and
loves
with
the
out
on
the
osage
brawls
at
new
orleans
and
all
the

on

rivers
all
the
godless
towns
of

only
she
who
loved
him
the
best
of
all
in
her
loving
knew
him
the
best
of
all
and
other
than
that
of
the
rumors
daily
she
prayed
for
him
with
conscious
and
tender
effusion
that
the
lord
would
convert
him
but
when
her
father
forbade
him
unto
her
thought
she
denied
him
and
likewise
held
him
for
outcast
turned
her
eyes
when
they
met
and
would
not
speak
though
her
heart
broke
bitter
and
brief
his
logic
that
reasoned
from
wrong
unto
error
this
is
their
praying
and
singing
he
said
that
makes
you
reject
me
you
that
were
kind
to
me
once
but
i
think
my
fathers
religion
with
a
light
heart
in
the
breast
and
a
friendly
priest
to
absolve
one
better
than
all
these
conversions
that
only
bewilder
and
vex
me
and
that
have
made
men
so
hard
and
women
fickle
and
cruel
well
then
pray
for
my
soul
since
you
would
not
have
spoken
to
save
me
yes
for
i
go
from
these
saints
to
my
brethren
and
sisters
the
sinners
spoke
and
went
while
her
faint
lips
fashioned
unuttered
entreaties
went
and
came
again
in
a
year
at
the
time
of
the
meeting
haggard
and
wan
of
face
and
wasted
with
passion
and
sorrow
dead
in
his
eyes
was
the
careless
smile
of
old
and
its
phantom
haunted
his
lips
in
a
sneer
of
restless
incredulous
mocking
day
by
day
he
came
to
the
outer
skirts
of
the
circle
dwelling
on
her
where
she
knelt
by
the
exhorter
her
father
with
his
hollow
looks
and
never
moved
from
his
silence
now
where
he
stood
alone
the
last
of
impenitent
sinners
weeping
old
friends
and
comrades
came
to
him
out
of
the
circle
and
with
their
tears
besought
him
to
hear
what
the
lord
had
done
for
them
ever
he
shook
them
off
not
roughly
nor
smiled
at
their
transports
then
the
preachers
spoke
and
painted
the
terrors
of
judgment
and
of
the
bottomless
pit
and
the
flames
of
hell
everlasting
still
and
dark
he
stood
and
neither
listened
nor
heeded
but
when
the
fervent
voice
of
the
exhorter
was
lifted
fell
his
brows
in
a
scowl
of
fierce
and
scornful
rejection
lord
let
this
soul
be
saved
cried
the
fervent
voice
of
the
old
man
for
that
the
shepherd
rejoiceth
more
truly
for
one
that
hath
wandered
and
hath
been
found
again
than
for
all
the
others
that
strayed
not
out
of
the
midst
of
the
people
a
woman
old
and
decrepit
tremulous
through
the
light
and
tremulous
into
the
shadow
wavered
toward
him
with
slow
uncertain
paces
of
palsy
laid
her
quivering
hand
on
his
arm
and
brokenly
prayed
him
louis
lebeau
i
closed
in
death
the
eyes
of
your
mother
on
my
breast
she
died
in
prayer
for
her
fatherless
children
that
they
might
know
the
lord
and
follow
him
always
and
serve
him
o
i
conjure
you
my
son
by
the
name
of
your
mother
in
glory
scorn
not
the
grace
of
the
lord
as
when
a
tempest
breaks
in
one
swift
gush
of
rain
then
ceases
and
gathers
darker
and
gloomier
yet
on
the
lowering
front
of
the
heavens
so
broke
his
mood
in
tears
as
he
soothed
her
and
stilled
her
entreaties
and
so
he
turned
again
with
his
clouded
looks
to
the
people
vibrated
then
from
the
hush
the
accents
of
mournfullest
pity
his
who
was
gifted
in
speech
and
the
glow
of
the
fires
illumined
all
his
pallid
aspect
with
sudden
and
marvellous
splendor
louis
lebeau
he
spake
i
have
known
you
and
loved
you
from
childhood
still
when
the
others
blamed
you
i
took
your
part
for
i
knew
you
louis
lebeau
my
brother
i
thought
to
meet
you
in
heaven
hand
in
hand
with
her
who
is
gone
to
heaven
before
us
brothers
through
her
dear
love
i
trusted
to
greet
you
and
lead
you
up
from
the
brink
of
the
river
unto
the
gates
of
the
city
lo
my
years
shall
be
few
on
the
earth
o
my
brother
if
i
should
die
before
you
had
known
the
mercy
of
jesus
yea
i
think
it
would
sadden
the
hope
of
glory
within
me
neither
yet
had
the
will
of
the
sinner
yielded
an
answer
but
from
his
lips
there
broke
a
cry
of
unspeakable
anguish
wild
and
fierce
and
shrill
as
if
some
demon
within
him
bent
his
soul
with
the
ultimate
pangs
of
fiendish
possession
and
with
the
outstretched
arms
of
bewildered
imploring
toward
them
unto
the
people
he
turned
his
face
from
the
darkness
out
of
the
sedge
by
the
creek
a
flight
of
clamorous
killdees
rose
from
their
timorous
sleep
with
piercing
and
iterant
challenge
wheeled
in
the
starlight
and
fled
away
into
distance
and
silence
white
in
the
vale
lay
the
tents
and
beyond
them
glided
the
river
where
the
broadhorn
drifted
slow
at
the
will
of
the
current
and
where
the
boatman
listened
and
knew
not
how
as
he
listened
something
touched
through
the
years
the
old
lost
hopes
of
his
childhood
only
his
sense
was
filled
with
low
monotonous
murmurs
as
of
a
prayer
that
was
chorused
with
deeper
responses
not
with
the
rest
was
lifted
her
voice
in
the
fervent
responses
but
in
her
soul
she
prayed
to
him
that
heareth
in
secret
asking
for
light
and
for
strength
to
learn
his
will
and
to
do
it
o
make
me
clear
to
know
if
the
hope
that
rises
within
me
be
not
part
of
a
love
unmeet
for
me
here
and
forbidden
so
if
it
be
not
that
make
me
strong
for
the
evil
entreaty
of
the
days
that
shall
bring
me
question
of
self
and
reproaches
when
the
unrighteous
shall
mock
and
my
brethren
and
sisters
shall
doubt
me
make
me
worthy
to
know
thy
will
my
savior
and
do
it
in
her
pain
she
prayed
and
at
last
through
her
mute
adoration
rapt
from
all
mortal
presence
and
in
her
rapture
uplifted
glorified
she
rose
and
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
people
looking
on
all
with
the
still
unseeing
eyes
of
devotion
vague
and
tender
and
sweet
as
the
eyes
of
the
dead
when
we
dream
them
living
and
looking
on
us
but
they
can
not
speak
and
we
can
not
knowing
only
the
peril
that
threatened
his
soul
unrepentance
knowing
only
the
fear
and
error
and
wrong
that
withheld
him
thinking
in
doubt
of
me
his
soul
had
perished
forever
touched
with
no
feeble
shame
but
trusting
her
power
to
save
him
through
the
circle
she
passed
and
straight
to
the
side
of
her
lover
took
his
hand
in
her
own
and
mutely
implored
him
an
instant
answering
giving
forgiving
confessing
beseeching
him
all
things
drew
him
then
with
her
and
passed
once
more
through
the
circle
unto
her
place
and
knelt
with
him
there
by
the
side
of
her
father
trembling
as
women
tremble
who
greatly
venture
and
triumph
but
in
her
innocent
breast
was
the
saint
sublime
exultation
so
was
louis
converted
and
though
the
lips
of
the
scorners
spared
not
in
after
years
the
subtle
taunt
and
derision
what
time
meeker
grown
his
heart
held
his
hand
from
its
answer
not
the
less
lofty
and
pure
her
love
and
her
faith
that
had
saved
him
not
the
less
now
discerned
was
her
inspiration
from
heaven
by
the
people
that
rose
and
embracing
and
weeping
together
poured
forth
their
jubilant
songs
of
victory
and
of
thanksgiving
till
from
the
embers
leaped
the
dying
flame
to
behold
them
and
the
hills
of
the
river
were
filled
with
reverberant
echoes
echoes
that
out
of
the
years
and
the
distance
stole
to
me
hither
while
i
moved
unwilled
in
the
mellow
warmth
of
the
weather
echoes
that
mingled
and
fainted
and
fell
with
the
fluttering
murmurs
in
the
hearts
of
the
hushing
bells
as
from
island
to
island
swooned
the
sound
on
the
wide
lagoons
into
palpitant
silence
footnote
the
flatboats
were
so
called
caprice
i
she
hung
the
cage
at
the
window
if
he
goes
by
she
said
he
will
hear
my
robin
singing
and
when
he
lifts
his
head
i
shall
be
sitting
here
to
sew
and
he
will
bow
to
me
i
know
the
robin
sang
a
song
the
young
man
raised
his
head
the
maiden
turned
away
and
blushed
i
am
a
fool
she
said
and
went
on
broidering
in
silk
a
rabbit
white
as
milk
ii
the
young
man
loitered
slowly
by
the
house
three
times
that
day
she
took
her
bird
from
the
window
he
need
not
look
this
way
she
sat
at
her
piano
long
and
sighed
and
played
a
song
but
when
the
day
was
done
she
said
i
wish
that
he
would
come
remember
mary
if
he
calls
i
not
at
home
so
when
he
rang
she
went
the
elf
she
went
and
let
him
in
herself
iii
they
sang
full
long
together
their
songs
the
robin
woke
from
his
slumber
and
rang
out
clear
and
glad
now
go
she
coldly
said
is
late
and
followed
him
to
latch
the
gate
he
took
the
rosebud
from
her
hair
while
you
shall
not
she
said
he
closed
her
hand
within
his
own
and
while
her
tongue
forbade
her
will
was
darkened
in
the
eclipse
of
blinding
love
upon
his
lips
sweet
clover
my
letters
back
to
me
i
know
they
won
the
faint
perfume
that
to
their
faded
pages
clings
from
gloves
and
handkerchiefs
and
things
kept
in
the
soft
and
scented
gloom
of
some
mysterious
box
poor
leaves
of
summer
now
as
sere
and
dead
as
any
leaves
of
summer
shed
from
crimson
boughs
when
autumn
grieves
the
ghost
of
fragrance
yet
i
thrill
all
through
with
such
delicious
pain
of
soul
and
sense
to
breathe
again
the
sweet
that
haunted
memory
still
and
under
these
december
skies
as
bland
as
may
in
other
climes
i
move
and
muse
my
idle
rhymes
and
subtly
sentimentalize
i
hear
the
music
that
was
played
the
songs
that
silence
knows
by
heart
i
see
sweet
burlesque
feigning
art
the
careless
grace
that
curved
and
swayed
through
dances
and
through
breezy
walks
i
feel
once
more
the
eyes
that
smiled
and
that
dear
presence
that
beguiled
the
pauses
of
the
foolish
talks
when
this
poor
phantom
of
perfume
was
the
sweet
clover
living
soul
and
breathed
from
her
as
if
it
stole
ah
heaven
from
her
heart
in
bloom
ii
we
have
not
many
ways
with
pain
we
weep
weak
tears
or
else
we
laugh
i
doubt
not
less
the
cup
we
quaff
and
tears
and
scorn
alike
are
vain
but
let
me
live
my
quiet
life
i
will
not
vex
my
calm
with
grief
i
only
know
the
pang
was
brief
and
there
an
end
of
hope
and
strife
and
thou
i
put
the
letters
by
in
years
the
sweetness
shall
not
pass
more
than
the
perfect
blossom
was
i
count
its
lingering
memory
alas
with
time
dear
love
is
dead
and
not
with
fate
and
who
can
guess
how
weary
of
our
happiness
we
might
have
been
if
we
were
wed
venice
the
royal
portraits
at
ludwigshof
i
confronting
each
other
the
pictures
stare
into
each
other
sleepless
eyes
and
the
daylight
into
the
darkness
dies
from
year
to
year
in
the
palace
there
but
they
watch
and
guard
that
no
device
take
either
one
of
them
unaware
their
majesties
the
king
and
the
queen
the
parents
of
the
reigning
prince
both
put
off
royalty
many
years
since
with
life
and
the
gifts
that
have
always
been
given
to
kings
from
god
to
evince
his
sense
of
the
mighty
over
the
mean
i
can
not
say
that
i
like
the
face
of
the
king
it
is
something
fat
and
red
and
the
neck
that
lifts
the
royal
head
is
thick
and
coarse
and
a
scanty
grace
dwells
in
the
dull
blue
eyes
that
are
laid
sullenly
on
the
queen
in
her
place
he
must
have
been
a
king
in
his
day
well
to
pleasure
in
work
and
sport
one
of
the
sort
who
ruled
his
people
with
iron
sway
and
knew
that
through
good
and
evil
report
god
meant
him
to
rule
and
them
to
obey
there
are
many
other
likenesses
of
the
king
in
his
royal
palace
there
you
find
him
depicted
everywhere
in
his
robes
of
state
in
his
in
his
flowing
wig
in
his
powdered
hair
a
king
in
all
of
them
none
the
less
but
most
himself
in
this
on
the
wall
over
against
his
consort
whose
laces
and
hoops
and
shoes
make
her
the
finest
lady
of
all
the
queens
or
courtly
dames
you
choose
in
the
ancestral
portrait
hall
a
glorious
blonde
a
luxury
of
luring
blue
and
wanton
gold
of
blanchéd
rose
and
crimson
bold
of
lines
that
flow
voluptuously
in
tender
languorous
curves
to
fold
her
form
in
perfect
symmetry
she
might
have
been
false
of
her
withered
dust
there
scarcely
would
be
enough
to
write
her
guilt
in
now
and
the
dead
have
a
right
to
our
lenient
doubt
if
not
to
our
trust
so
if
the
truth
can
not
make
her
white
let
us
be
as
merciful
as
we
must
ii
the
queen
died
first
the
queen
died
young
but
the
king
was
very
old
when
he
died
rotten
with
license
and
lust
and
pride
and
the
usual
virtues
came
and
hung
their
cypress
wreaths
on
his
tomb
and
wide
throughout
his
kingdom
his
praise
was
sung
how
the
queen
died
is
not
certainly
known
and
faithful
subjects
are
all
forbid
to
speak
of
the
murder
which
some
one
did
one
night
while
she
slept
in
the
dark
alone
history
keeps
the
story
hid
and
fear
only
tells
it
in
undertone
up
from
your
startled
feet
aloof
in
the
famous
with
a
bound
leaps
the
echo
and
round
and
round
beating
itself
against
the
roof
a
horrible
gasping
shuddering
sound
dies
ere
its
terror
can
utter
proof
of
that
it
knows
a
door
is
fast
and
none
is
suffered
to
enter
there
his
sacred
majesty
could
not
bear
to
look
at
it
toward
the
last
as
he
grew
very
old
it
opened
where
the
queen
died
young
so
many
years
past
iii
how
the
queen
died
is
not
certainly
known
but
in
the
palace
solitude
a
harking
dread
and
horror
brood
and
a
silence
as
if
a
mortal
groan
had
been
hushed
the
moment
before
and
would
break
forth
again
when
you
were
gone
the
present
king
has
never
dwelt
in
the
desolate
palace
from
year
to
year
in
the
wide
and
stately
garden
drear
the
snows
and
the
snowy
blossoms
melt
unheeded
and
a
ghastly
fear
through
all
the
shivering
leaves
is
felt
by
night
the
gathering
shadows
creep
along
the
dusk
and
hollow
halls
and
the
palace
calls
with
stifled
moans
from
its
nightmare
sleep
and
then
the
ghostly
moonlight
falls
athwart
the
darkness
brown
and
deep
at
early
dawn
the
light
wind
sighs
and
through
the
desert
garden
blows
the
wasted
sweetness
of
the
rose
at
noon
the
feverish
sunshine
lies
sick
in
the
walks
but
at
evening
close
when
the
last
long
rays
to
the
windows
rise
and
with
many
a
wrathful
streak
pierce
through
the
twilight
glooms
that
blur
his
cruel
vigilance
and
her
regard
they
light
fierce
looks
that
wreak
a
hopeless
hate
that
can
not
stir
a
voiceless
hate
that
can
not
speak
in
the
awful
calm
of
the
sleepless
eyes
and
as
if
she
saw
her
murderer
glare
on
her
face
and
he
the
white
despair
of
his
victim
kindle
in
wild
surmise
confronted
the
conscious
pictures
stare
and
their
secret
back
into
darkness
dies

faithful
of

downcast
through

garden

is
hurt
with
the
grace
of
the
lily
and
the
beauty
of
the
rose
for
what
is
the
grace
of
the
lily
but
her
own
slender
grace
and
what
is
the
rose
beauty
but
the
beauty
of
her
face
who
sits
beside
her
window
waiting
to
welcome
him
that
comes
so
lothly
toward
her
with
his
visage
sick

from

furious
presence
i
never

enter
more
i
would
not

him
by

thou
equal
truth
wilt
keep
me
in
welfare
and
in
woe
the
maiden
answered
him
nothing
of
herself
but
his
words
again
came
back
through
her
lips
like
an
echo
from
an
abyss
of
pain
and
vacantly
repeating
in
welfare
and
in
woe
like
a
dream
from
the
heart
of
fever
from
her
arms

felt
him
go

gate
at
daybreak
seven
comrades
wander
forth
on

path
that
leads
at
their
humor

south
or
north
the
prince
laugh
rings
lightly
what
road
shall
we
take
from

they
answer
we
never
shall
lose
it
if
we
take
the
road
to

with
many
a
jest
and
banter
the
comrades
keep
their
way
journeying
out
of
the
twilight
forward
into
the
day
when
they
are
aware
beside
them
goes
a
pretty
minstrel
lad
with
a
shy
and
downward
aspect
that
is
neither
sad
nor
glad
over
his
slender
shoulder
his
mandolin
was
slung
and
around
its
chords
the
treasure
of
his
golden
tresses
hung

one
of

seven
companions

minstrel

away
with

comrades
on

journey

of

seven
companions

be
hard

will
lighten
it
with
my
music

it

song

one
of

seven
companions

what
are
the
songs
thou
o
i
know
many

this
i
sing
the
most
how
once
was
an
humble
maiden
beloved
of
a
great
lord
son
that
for
her
sake
and
his
troth
sake
was
banished
and
undone
and
forth
of
his
father
city

went
at
break
of
day
and
the
maiden
softly
followed
behind
him
on
the
way
in
the
figure
of
a
minstrel
and
prayed
him
of
his
love
me
go
with
thee
and
serve
thee
wherever
thou
rove
if
thou
goest
in
exile
i
rest

thou
wanderest

thee

fears
in
anguish
roam
thy
path
with
perils
making
thee
hungry
and
cold
filling
thy
heart
with
trouble
and
heaviness
untold

me
go
beside
thee

story
at

of

sent
him
by

of

to
save
his

from
robbers
in

lonely
desert
place
word
from
the
monks
of
a
convent
of
gentle
comrades
that
lay
one
stormy
night
at
their
convent
and
passed
with
the
storm
at
day
the
long
parley
of
a
peasant
that
sold
them
wine
and
food
the
gossip
of
a
shepherd
that
guided
them
through
a
wood
a
boatman
talk
at
the
ferry
of
a
river
where
they
crossed
and
as
if
they
had
sunk
in

current
all
trace
of
them
was
lost
and
so
is
an
end
of
tidings
but
never
an
end
of
tears
of
secret
and
friendless
sorrow
through
blank
and
silent
years
to
the
marchioness
in

chamber
sends
word
a
messenger
newly
come
from
the
land
of
naples
praying
for
speech
with
her
the
messenger
stands
before
her
a
minstrel
slender
and
wan
in
a
village
of
my
country
lies
a
mantuan
gentleman
sick
of
a
smouldering
fever
of
sorrow
and
poverty
and
no
one
in
all
that
country
knows
his
title
or
degree
but
six
true
mantuan
peasants
or
nobles
as
some
men
say
watch
by
the
sick
man
bedside
and
toil
for
him
night
and
day
hewing
digging
reaping
sowing
bearing
burdens
and
far
and
nigh
begging
for
him
on
the
highway
of
the
strangers
that
pass
by
and
they
look
whenever
you
meet
them
like
men
and
i
heard
that
the
sick
man
would
not
if
he
could
be
well
again
for
they
say
that
he
for
love
sake
was
gladly
banishèd
but
she
for
whom
he
was
banished
is
worse
to
him
now
than
dead
a
recreant
to
his
sorrow
a
traitress
to
his
woe
from
her
place
the
marchioness
rises
the
minstrel
turns
to
go
but
fast
by
the
hand
she
takes
him
his
hand
in
her
clasp
is
cold
if
gold
may
be
thy
guerdon
thou
shalt
not
lack
for
gold
and
if
the
love
of
a
mother
can
bless
thee
for
that
thou
hast
done
thou
shalt
stay
and
be
his
brother
thou
shalt
stay
and
be
my
son
nay
my
lady
answered
the
minstrel
and
his
face
is
deadly
pale
nay
this
must
not
be
sweet
lady
but
let
my
words
prevail
let
me
go
now
from
your
presence
and
i
will
come
again
when
you
stand
with
your
son
beside
you
and
be

is

him
the
stormy
brows
of
the
marquis
his
eyes
are
tender
and
dim
he
lies
sick
of
a
fever
in
naples
near
unto
death
as
they
tell
in
his
need
and
pain
forsaken
by
the
wanton
he
loved
so
well
now
send
for
him
and
forgive
him
if
ever
thou
me
now
send
for
him
and
forgive
him
as
god
shall
be
good
to
thee
well
so
if
he
turn
in
repentance
and
bow
himself
to
my
will

rustle

the

with

the
six

on

side
the

gray
as
his

where
they
stand

the
six

are
like
old
men
in
their
place
the
marquis
takes
the
comrades
and
kisses
them
one
by

that

after

viii
to
the
marchioness
comes
a
courtier
i
am
prayed
to
bring
you
word
that
the
minstrel
keeps
his
promise
who
brought
you
news
of
my
lord
and
he
waits
without
the
circle
to
kiss
your
highness
hand
and
he
asks
no
gold
for
guerdon
but
before
he
leaves
the
land
he
craves
of
your
love
once
proffered
that
you
suffer
him
for
reward
in
this
crowning
hour
of
his
glory
to
look
on
your
son
my
lord
through
the
silken
press
of
the
courtiers
the
minstrel
faltered
in
his
claspèd
hands
were
bloodless
his
face
was
white
and
thin
and
he
bent
his
knee
to
the
lady
but
of
her
love
and
grace
to
her
heart
she
raised
him
and
kissed
him
upon
his
gentle
face
turned
to
her
son
the
bridegroom
turned
to
his
wife
i
give
you
here
for
your
brother
who
gave
back
my
son
to
life
for
this
youth
brought
me
news
from
naples
how
thou
layest
sick
and
poor
by
true
comrades
kept
and
forsaken
by
a
false
paramour

i
charge
you

him
for
a
brother
that
is
my
son
the
comrades
turned
to
the
bridegroom
in
silence
every
one
but
the
bridegroom
looked
on
the
minstrel
with
a
visage
blank
and
changed
as
his
whom
the
sight
of
a
spectre
from
his
reason
hath
estranged
and
the
smiling
courtiers
near
them
on
a
sudden
were
still
as
death
and
the
people
hearkened
and
held
their
breath
with
an
awe
uncomprehended
for
an
unseen
agony
who
is
this
that
lies
with
her
head
on
the
prince
knee
a
light
of
anguish
and
wonder
is
in
the
prince
eye
o
speak
sweet
saint
and
forgive
me
or
i
can
not
let
thee
die
for
now
i
see
thy
hardness
was
softer
than
mortal
ruth
and
thy
heavenly
guile
was
whiter
my
saint
than

he
gives
his
own
footnotes
the
author
of
this
ballad
has
added
a
thread
of
evident
to
a
most
romantic
incident
of
the
history
of
mantua
which
occurred
in
the
fifteenth
century
he
relates
the
incident
so
nearly
as
he
found
it
in
the
that
he
is
ashamed
to
say
how
little
his
invention
has
been
employed
in
it
the
hero
of
the
story
federigo
became
the
third
marquis
of
mantua
and
was
a
prince
greatly
beloved
and
honored

his

you

i
have
eaten
a

since
the
ignorant
joy
of
anything
sweet
in
the
mouth
could
sweeten
all
this
bitter
world
for
a
boy
ii
o
i
mind
the
tree
in
the
meadow
stood
by
the
road
near
the
hill
when
i
clomb
aloof
on
its
branches
this
side
of
the
girdled
wood
i
could
see
the
top
of
our
cabin
roof
and
looking
westward
could
sweep
the
shores
of
the
river
where
we
used
to
swim
under
the
ghostly
sycamores
haunting
the
waters
smooth
and
dim
and
eastward
athwart
the
and
over
the
buckwheat
field
i
could
see
the
stately
elm
where
i
shot
the
first
black
squirrel
i
ever
killed
and
southward
over
the
i
could
see
the
mellow
breadths
of
farm
from
the
to
the
hills
expand
clasped
in
the
curving
river
arm
in
the
fields
we
set
our
guileless
snares
for
rabbits
and
pigeons
and
wary
quails
content
with
the
vaguest
feathers
and
hairs
from
doubtful
wings
and
vanished
tails
and
in
the
blue
summer
afternoon
we
used
to
sit
in
the
the
breaths
of
wind
that
remembered
june
shook
the
leaves
and
glittering
berries
free
and
while
we
watched
the
wagons
go
across
the
river
along
the
road
to
the
mill
above
or
the
mill
below
with
horses
that
stooped
to
the
heavy
load
we
told
old
stories
and
made
new
plans
and
felt
our
hearts
gladden
within
us
again
for
we
did
not
dream
that
this
life
of
a
could
ever
be
what
we
know
as
men
we
sat
so
still
that
the
woodpeckers
came
and
pillaged
the
berries
overhead
from
his
log
the
chipmonk
waxen
tame
peered
and
listened
to
what
we
said
iii
one
of
us
long
ago
was
carried
to
his
grave
on
the
hill
above
the
tree
one
is
a
farmer
there
and
married
one
has
wandered
over
the
sea
and
if
you
ask
me
i
hardly
know
whether
i
be
the
dead
or
the
clown
the
clod
above
or
the
clay
below
or
this
listless
dust
by
fortune
blown
to
alien
lands
for
however
it
is
so
little
we
keep
with
us
in
life
at
best
we
win
only
victories
not
peace
not
peace
o
friend
in
this
strife
but
if
i
could
turn
from
the
long
defeat
of
the
little
successes
once
more
and
be
a
boy
with
the
whole
wide
world
at
my
feet
under
the
shade
of
the
from
the
shame
of
the
squandered
chances
the
sleep
of
the
will
that
can
not
itself
awaken
from
the
promise
the
future
can
never
keep
from
the
fitful
purposes
vague
and
shaken
then
while
the
grasshopper
sang
out
shrill
in
the
grass
beneath
the
blanching
thistle
and
the
afternoon
air
with
a
tender
thrill
harked
to
the
quail
complaining
whistle
ah
me
should
i
paint
the
morrows
again
in
quite
the
colors
so
faint
and
with
the
imperial
mulberry
stain
life
doublet
of
know
again
the
losses
of
disillusion
for
the
sake
of
the
hope
have
the
old
deceit
in
spite
of
the
question
bitter
infusion
do
you
find
these
mulberries
all
our
atoms
are
changed
they
say
and
the
taste
is
so
different
since
then
we
live
but
a
world
has
passed
away
with
the
years
that
perished
to
make
us
men
before
the
gate
they
gave
the
whole
long
day
to
idle
laughter
to
fitful
song
and
jest
to
moods
of
soberness
as
idle
after
and
silences
as
idle
too
as
the
rest
but
when
at
last
upon
their
way
returning
taciturn
late
and
loath
through
the
broad
meadow
in
the
sunset
burning
they
reached
the
gate
one
fine
spell
hindered
them
both
her
heart
was
troubled
with
a
subtile
anguish
such
as
but
women
know
that
wait
and
lest
love
speak
or
speak
not
languish
and
what
they
would
would
rather
they
would
not
so
till
he
said
nothing
comprehending
of
all
the
wondrous
guile
that
women
won
win
themselves
with
and
bending
eyes
of
relentless
asking
on
her
the
while
ah
if
beyond
this
gate
the
path
united
our
steps
as
far
as
death
and
i
might
open
it
his
voice
affrighted
at
its
own
daring
faltered
under
his
breath
then
she
whom
both
his
faith
and
fear
enchanted
far
beyond
words
to
tell
feeling
her
woman
finest
wit
had
wanted
the
art
he
had
that
knew
to
blunder
so
well
shyly
drew
near
a
little
step
and
mocking
shall
we
not
be
too
late
for
tea
she
said
i
quite
worn
out
with
walking
yes
thanks
your
arm
and
will
you
open
the
gate
clement
i
that
time
of
year
you
know
when
the
summer
beginning
to
sadden
and
glides
from
the
heart
of
september
mourned
by
disconsolate
crickets
and
iterant
grasshoppers
crying
all
the
still
nights
long
from
the
ripened
abundance
of
gardens
then
ere
the
boughs
of
the
maples
are
mantled
with
earliest
autumn
but
the
wind
of
autumn
breathes
from
the
orchards
at
nightfall
full
of
winy
perfume
and
mystical
yearning
and
languor
and
in
the
noonday
woods
you
hear
the
foraging
squirrels
and
the
long
crashing
fall
of
the
nut
from
the
when
the
robins
are
mute
and
the
haunting
the
thistles
cheep
and
twitter
and
flit
through
the
dusty
lanes
and
the
loppings
when
the
pheasant
booms
from
your
stealthy
foot
in
the
cornfield
and
the
feed
few
and
shy
in
the
bushes
when
the
weary
land
lies
hushed
like
a
seer
in
a
vision
and
your
life
seems
but
the
dream
of
a
dream
which
you
can
not
remember
broken
bewildering
vague
an
echo
that
answers
to
nothing
that
time
of
year
you
know
they
stood
by
the
gate
in
the
meadow
fronting
the
sinking
sun
and
the
level
stream
of
its
splendor
crimsoned
the
and
woodland
with
tenderest
sunset
made
her
beautiful
face
like
the
luminous
face
of
an
angel
smote
through
the
painéd
gloom
of
his
heart
like
a
hurt
to
the
sense
there
languidly
clung
about
by
the
shawl
and
with
folded
hands
that
held
a
few
sad
asters
i
sigh
for
this
idyl
lived
at
last
to
an
end
and
looking
on
to
my
with
a
smile
she
said
and
a
subtle
derision
of
manner
better
and
better
i
seem
when
i
recollect
all
that
has
happened
since
i
came
here
in
june
the
walks
we
have
taken
together
through
these
darling
meadows
and
dear
old
desolate
woodlands
all
our
afternoon
readings
and
all
our
strolls
through
the
moonlit
village
so
sweetly
asleep
one
scarcely
could
credit
the
scandal
heartache
and
trouble
and
spite
that
were
hushed
for
the
night
in
its
silence
yes
i
am
better
i
think
i
could
even
be
civil
to
for
his
kindness
letting
me
come
here
without
him
but
open
the
gate
cousin
clement
seems
to
me
it
grows
chill
and
i
think
it
is
healthier
no
then
i
you
need
not
speak
for
i
know
well
enough
what
is
coming
bitter
taunts
for
the
past
and
discouraging
views
of
the
future
tragedy
cousin
clement
or
comedy
just
as
you
like
it
only
not
here
alone
but
somewhere
that
people
can
see
you
then
i
take
part
in
the
play
and
appear
the
remorseful
young
person
full
of
divine
regrets
at
not
having
smothered
a
genius
under
the
feathers
and
silks
of
a
foolish
extravagant
woman
o
you
selfish
boy
what
was
it
just
now
about
anguish
bills
would
be
your
talk
cousin
clement
if
you
were
my
husband
then
with
her
glory
of
eyes
upon
him
his
thoughts
as
the
pondered
stars
bewilder
and
darken
tenderly
wistfully
drooping
toward
him
she
faltered
in
whisper
all
her
mocking
face
transfigured
with
mournful
effusion
clement
do
not
think
it
is
you
alone
that
remember
do
not
think
it
is
you
alone
that
have
suffered
ambition
fame
and
your
art
you
have
all
these
things
to
console
you
i
what
have
i
in
this
world
since
my
child
is
dead
a
bereavement
sad
hung
her
eyes
on
his
and
he
felt
all
the
anger
within
him
broken
and
melting
in
tears
but
he
shrank
from
her
touch
while
he
answered
awkwardly
being
a
man
and
awkwardly
being
a
lover
yes
you
know
how
it
is
done
you
have
cleverly
fooled
me
beforetime
with
a
dainty
scorn
and
then
an
imploring
forgiveness
yes
you
might
play
it
i
think
that
of
remorseful
young
person
that
or
the
old
man
darling
or
anything
else
you
attempted
even
your
earnest
is
so
much
like
acting
i
fear
a
betrayal
trusting
your
speech
you
say
that
you
have
not
forgotten
i
grant
you
not
indeed
for
your
word
that
is
light
but
i
wish
to
believe
you
well
i
say
since
you
have
not
forgotten
forget
now
forever
i
i
have
lived
and
loved
and
you
have
lived
and
have
married
only
receive
this
bud
to
remember
me
when
we
have
parted
thorns
and
splendor
no
sweetness
rose
of
the
love
that
i
cherished
there
he
tore
from
its
stalk
the
imperial
flower
of
the
thistle
tore
and
gave
to
her
who
took
it
with
mocking
obeisance
twined
it
in
her
hair
and
said
with
her
subtle
derision
you
are
a
wiser
man
than
i
thought
you
could
ever
be
clement
sensible
almost
so
i
try
to
forget
and
remember
lightly
she
took
his
arm
but
on
through
the
lane
to
the
mutely
together
they
moved
through
the
lonesome
odorous
twilight
ii
high
on
the
hearth
the
first
autumn
fire
was
kindled
scintillant
hickory
bark
and
dryest
limbs
of
the
burned
where
all
summer
long
the
boughs
of
asparagus
flourished
wild
were
the
children
with
mirth
and
grouping
and
clinging
together
danced
with
the
dancing
flame
and
lithely
swayed
with
its
humor
ran
to
the
and
peering
forth
into
the
darkness
saw
there
another
room
and
with
frolicking
children
ah
by
such
phantom
hearths
i
think
that
we
sit
with
our
sometimes
they
tossed
on
the
floor
and
sometimes
they
hid
in
the
corners
shouting
and
laughing
aloud
and
never
resting
a
moment
in
the
rude
delight
the
boisterous
gladness
of
childhood
cruel
as
summer
sun
and
to
the
heartsick
clement
sat
in
his
chair
unmoved
in
the
midst
of
the
hubbub
rapt
with
unseeing
eyes
and
unafraid
in
their
gambols
by
his
tawny
beard
the
children
caught
him
and
clambered
over
his
knees
and
waged
a
mimic
warfare
across
them
made
him
their
and
won
and
lost
kingdoms
upon
him
airily
to
and
fro
and
out
of
one
room
to
another
passed
his
cousin
and
busied
herself
with
things
of
the
household
nonchalant
debonair
blithe
with
bewitching
housewifely
importance
laying
the
cloth
for
the
supper
and
bringing
the
meal
from
the
kitchen
fairer
than
ever
she
seemed
and
more
than
ever
she
mocked
him
coming
behind
his
chair
and
clasping
her
fingers
together
over
his
eyes
in
a
girlish
caprice
and
crying
who
is
it
vexed
his
despair
with
a
vision
of
wife
and
of
home
and
of
children
calling
his
sister
children
around
her
and
stilling
their
clamor
making
believe
they
were
hers
and
clement
sat
moody
and
silent
blank
to
the
wistful
gaze
of
his
mother
bent
on
his
visage
with
the
tender
pain
the
pitiful
helpless
devotion
of
the
mother
that
looks
on
the
face
of
her
son
in
his
trouble
grown
beyond
her
consoling
and
knows
that
she
can
not
befriend
him
then
his
cousin
laughed
and
in
idleness
talked
with
the
children
sometimes
she
turned
to
him
and
then
when
the
thistle
was
falling
caught
it
and
twined
it
again
in
her
hair
and
called
it
her
keepsake
smiled
and
made
him
ashamed
of
his
petulant
gift
there
before
them
but
when
the
night
was
grown
old
and
the
two
by
the
hearthstone
together
sat
alone
in
the
flickering
red
of
the
flame
and
the
cricket
carked
to
the
stillness
and
ever
with
sullen
throbs
of
the
pendule
sighed
the
clock
for
the
death
of
the
days
that
were
perished
it
was
her
whim
to
be
sad
and
she
brought
him
the
book
they
were
reading
read
it
she
said
that
i
may
not
seem
to
be
going
said
and
mutely
reproached
him
with
all
the
pain
she
had
wrought
him
from
her
hand
he
took
the
volume
and
read
and
she
listened
all
his
voice
molten
in
secret
tears
and
ebbing
and
flowing
now
with
a
faltering
breath
and
now
with
impassioned
abandon
read
from
the
book
of
a
poet
the
rhyme
of
the
fatally
sundered
fatally
met
too
late
and
their
love
was
their
guilt
and
their
anguish
but
in
the
night
they
rose
and
fled
away
into
the
darkness
glad
of
all
dangers
and
shames
and
even
of
death
for
their
sake
then
when
his
voice
brake
hollowly
falling
and
fading
to
silence
thrilled
in
the
silence
they
sat
and
durst
not
behold
one
another
feeling
that
wild
temptation
that
tender
ineffable
yearning
drawing
them
heart
to
heart
one
blind
mad
moment
of
passion
with
their
fate
they
strove
but
out
of
the
pang
of
the
conflict
through
such
costly
triumph
as
wins
a
waste
and
a
famine
victors
they
came
and
love
retrieved
the
error
of
loving
so
foreknowing
the
years
and
sharply
discerning
the
future
guessing
the
riddle
of
life
and
accepting
the
cruel
solution
side
by
side
they
sat
as
far
as
the
stars
are
asunder
carked
the
cricket
no
more
but
while
the
audible
silence
shrilled
in
their
ears
she
suddenly
rising
and
dragging
the
thistle
out
of
her
clinging
hair
laughed
mockingly
casting
it
from
her
perish
the
thorns
and
splendor
the
bloom
and
the
sweetness
are
perished
dreary
respectable
calm
polite
despair
and
one
duty
these
and
the
world
for
dead
love
the
end
of
these
modern
romances
better
than
yonder
rhyme

and
good
night
cousin
clement
by
the
sea
i
walked
with
her
i
love
by
the
sea
the
deep
came
up
with
its
chanting
waves
making
a
music
so
great
and
free
that
the
will
and
the
faith
which
were
dead
in
me
awoke
and
rose
from
their
graves
chanting
and
with
a
regal
sweep
of
their
garments
up
and
down
the
strand
came
the
mighty
waves
of
the
deep
dragging
the
drift
from
its
sleep
along
the
bare
and
brown
o
my
soul
make
the
song
of
the
sea
i
cried
how
it
comes
with
its
stately
tread
and
its
dreadful
voice
and
the
splendid
pride
of
its
regal
garments
flowing
wide
over
the
land
to
my
soul
i
said
my
soul
was
still

down

hast
thou

about

tenderness
and
over
the
wall
a
wandering
growth
of
darkest
and

ivy
clings
and
climbs
around
them
and
holds
them
both
in
its
netted
clasp

knots

and

brows

the
dimpled
chin
of
the
boy

plays
with
the

bends
his
smiling
looks

in
the
early
morning
when
i
wake
at
the
hour
that
is
sacred
for
his
sake
and
hear
the
happy
birds
of
spring
in
the
garden
under
my
window
sing
and
through
my
window
the
daybreak
blows
the
sweetness
of
the
lily
and
rose
a
dormant
anguish
wakes
with
day
and
my
heart
is
smitten
with
strange
dismay

a

word
that
swims
and
shines
on
my
tears
with
a
meaning
new
and
dread
make
faltering
reason
know
him
dead
and
i
would
that
my
heart
might
feel
it
too
and
unto
its
own
regret
be
true
for
this
is
the
hardest
of
all
to
bear
that
his
life
was
so
generous
and
fair
so
full
of
love
so
full
of
hope
broadening
out
with
ample
scope
and
so
far
from
death
that
his
dying
seems
the
idle
agony
of
dreams
to
my
heart
that
feels
him
living
yet
and
i
forget
and
i
forget
iii
he
was
almost
grown
a
man
when
he
passed
away
but
when
i
kissed
him
last
he
was
still
a
child
and
i
had
crept
up
to
the
little
room
where
he
slept
and
thought
to
kiss
him
in
his
sleep
but
he
was
awake
to
make
me
weep
with
terrible
homesickness
before
my
wayward
feet
had
passed
the
door
round
about
me
clung
his
embrace
and
he
pressed
against
my
face
his
face
as
if
some
prescience
whispered
him
then
that
it
never
never
should
be
again
iv
out
of
days
of
boyhood
dim
when
he
was
a
babe
and
i
played
with
him
i
remember
his
looks
and
all
his
ways
and
how
he
grew
through
childhood
grace
to
the
hopes
and
strifes
and
sports
and
joys
and
innocent
vanity
of
boys
i
hear
his
whistle
at
the
door
his
careless
step
upon
the
floor
his
song
his
jest
his
laughter
yet
and
i
forget
and
i
forget
somewhere
in
the
graveyard
that
i
know
where
the
strawberries
under
the
chestnuts
grow
they
have
laid
him
and
his
sisters
set
on
his
grave
the
flowers
their
tears
have
wet
and
above
his
grave
while
i
write
the
song
of
the
matin
robin
leaps
sweet
and
strong
from
the
leafy
dark
of
the
and
many
a
murmuring
on
the
strawberry
blossoms
in
the
grass
stoops
by
his
grave
and
will
not
pass
and
in
the
little
hollow
beneath
the
slope
of
the
silent
field
of
death
the
tinkle
soft
and
sweet
and
the
cattle
go
by
with
homeward
feet
and
the
squirrel
barks
from
the
sheltering
limb
at
the
harmless
noises
not
meant
for
him
and
nature
unto
her
loving
heart
has
taken
our
darling
mortal
part
tenderly
that
he
may
be
like
the
song
of
the
robin
in
the
tree
the
blossoms
the
grass
the
reeds
by
the
shore
a
part
of
summer
evermore

i
write
and
the
words
with
my
tears
are
wet

me
thou
that
sendest
this
pain
to
know
and
feel
my
loss
and

let
me
not
falter
in
belief
on
his
death
for
that
is

coming
there
are
birds
the
fields
are
green
there
is
balm
in
the
sunlight
and
moonlight
and
dew
in
the
twilights
between
but
over
there
is
a
silence
a
rapture
great
and
dumb
that
day
when
the
doubt
is
ended
and
at
last
the
spring
is
come
behold
the
wonder
o
silence
strange
as
if
wrought
in
a
night
the
waited
and
lingering
glory
the
fresh
delight
o
blossoms
that
hang
like
winter
drifted
upon

trees
o
birds
that
sing
in
the
blossoms
o
bees
o
green
green
leaves
on
the
branches
o
shadowy
dark
below
o
cool
of
the
aisles
of
orchards
woods
that
the
wild
flowers
know
o
air
of
gold
and
perfume
wind
breathing
sweet
and
sun
o
sky
of
perfect
azure
day
heaven
and
earth
in
one
let
me
draw
near
thy
secret
and
in
thy
deep
heart
see
how
fared
in
doubt
and
dreaming
the
spring
that
is
come
in
me
for
my
soul
is
held
in
silence
a
rapture
great
and
dumb
for
the
mystery
that
lingered
the
glory
that
is
come
in
earliest
spring
tossing
his
mane
of
snows
in
wildest
eddies
and
tangles
march
cometh
in
hoarse
with
tempestuous
breath
through
all
the
moaning
chimneys
and
thwart
all
the
hollows
and
angles
round
the
shuddering
house
threating
of
winter
and
death
but
in
my
heart
i
feel
the
life
of
the
wood
and
the
meadow
thrilling
the
pulses
that
own
kindred
with
fibres
that
lift
bud
and
blade
to
the
sunward
within
the
inscrutable
shadow
deep
in
the
oak
chill
core
under
the
gathering
drift
nay
to
earth
life
in
mine
some
prescience
or
dream
or
desire
how
shall
i
name
it
aright
comes
for
a
moment
and
goes
rapture
of
life
ineffable
perfect
as
if
in
the
brier
leafless
there
by
my
door
trembled
a
sense
of
the
rose
the
bobolinks
are
singing
out
of
its
fragrant
heart
of
bloom
the
bobolinks
are
singing
out
of
its
fragrant
heart
of
bloom
the
whispers
to
the
room
why
art
thou
but
a
nest
of
gloom
while
the
bobolinks
are
singing
the
two
wan
ghosts
of
the
chamber
there
the
bobolinks
are
singing
the
two
wan
ghosts
of
the
chamber
there
cease
in
the
breath
of
the
honeyed
air
sweep
from
the
room
and
leave
it
bare
while
the
bobolinks
are
singing
then
with
a
breath
so
chill
and
slow
the
bobolinks
are
singing
then
with
a
breath
so
chill
and
slow
it
freezes
the
blossoms
into
snow
the
haunted
room
makes
answer
low
while
the
bobolinks
are
singing
i
know
that
in
the
the
bobolinks
are
singing
i
know
that
in
the
the
sorrowful
slender
stand
and
the
brook
goes
by
on
the
other
hand
while
the
bobolinks
are
singing
but
ever
i
see
in
the
brawling
stream
the
bobolinks
are
singing
but
ever
i
see
in
the
brawling
stream
a
maiden
drowned
and
floating
dim
under
the
water
like
a
dream
while
the
bobolinks
are
singing
buried
she
lies
in
the
the
bobolinks
are
singing
buried
she
lies
in
the
under
the
sorrowful
elms
where
they
stand
wind
blow
over
her
soft
and
bland
while
the
bobolinks
are
singing
o
blow
but
stir
not
the
ghastly
thing
the
bobolinks
are
singing
o
blow
but
stir
not
the
ghastly
thing
the
farmer
saw
so
heavily
swing
from
the
elm
one
merry
morn
of
spring
while
the
bobolinks
were
singing
o
blow
and
blow
away
the
bloom
the
bobolinks
are
singing
o
blow
and
blow
away
the
bloom
that
sickens
me
in
my
heart
of
gloom
that
sweetly
sickens
the
haunted
room
while
the
bobolinks
are
singing
prelude
to
an
early
book
of
verse
in
march
the
earliest
bluebird
came
and
caroled
from
the
his
little
tremulous
songs
to
me
and
called
upon
the
summer
name
and
made
old
summers
in
my
heart
all
sweet
with
flower
and
sun
again
so
that
i
said
o
not
in
vain
shall
be
thy
lay
of
little
art
though
never
summer
sun
may
glow
nor
summer
flower
for
thee
may
bloom
though
winter
turn
in
sudden
gloom
and
drowse
the
stirring
spring
with
snow
and
learned
to
trust
if
i
should
call
upon
the
sacred
name
of
song
though
chill
through
march
i
languish
long
and
never
feel
the
may
at
all
yet
may
i
touch
in
some
who
hear
the
hearts
wherein
old
songs
asleep
wait
but
the
feeblest
touch
to
leap
in
music
sweet
as
summer
air
i
sing
in
march
brief
bluebird
lays
and
hope
a
may
and
do
not
know
may
be
the
heaven
is
full
of
snow
may
be
there
open
summer
days
the
movers
sketch
parting
was
over
at
last
and
all
the
had
been
spoken
up
the
long
hillside
road
the
wagon
moved
slowly
bearing
the
mother
and
children
while
onward
before
them
the
father
trudged
with
his
gun
on
his
arm
and
the
faithful
beside
him
grave
and
sedate
as
if
knowing
the
sorrowful
thoughts
of
his
master
april
was
in
her
prime
and
the
day
in
its
dewy
awaking
like
a
great
flower
afar
on
the
crest
of
the
eastern
woodland
goldenly
bloomed
the
sun
and
over
the
beautiful
valley
dim
with
its
dew
and
shadow
and
bright
with
its
dream
of
a
river
looked
to
the
western
hills
and
shone
on
the
humble
procession
paining
with
splendor
the
children
eyes
and
the
heart
of
the
mother
beauty
and
fragrance
and
song
filled
the
air
like
a
palpable
presence
sweet
was
the
smell
of
the
dewy
leaves
and
the
flowers
in
the
fair
the
long
reaches
of
sun
and
shade
in
the
aisles
of
the
forest
glad
of
the
spring
and
of
love
and
of
morning
the
wild
birds
were
singing
jays
to
each
other
called
harshly
then
mellowly
fluted
together
sang
the
oriole
songs
as
golden
and
gay
as
his
plumage
pensively
piped
the
querulous
quails
their
greetings
unfrequent
while
on
the
meadow
elm
the
meadow
lark
gushed
forth
in
music
rapt
exultant
and
shaken
with
the
great
joy
of
his
singing
over
the
river
aloft
in
the
air
the
kingfisher
hung
ere
he
dropped
like
a
bolt
in
the
water
beneath
him
gossiping
out
of
the
bank
flew
myriad
twittering
swallows
and
in
the
boughs
of
the
sycamores
quarrelled
and
clamored
the
blackbirds
never
for
these
things
a
moment
halted
the
movers
but
onward
up
the
long
hillside
road
the
wagon
moved
slowly
till
on
the
summit
that
overlooked
all
the
beautiful
valley
trembling
and
spent
the
horses
came
to
a
standstill
unbidden
then
from
the
wagon
the
mother
in
silence
got
down
with
her
children
came
and
stood
by
the
father
and
rested
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
long
together
they
gazed
on
the
beautiful
valley
before
them
looked
on
the
fields
that
stretched
away
to
the
woodlands
where
in
the
dark
lines
of
green
showed
the
crest
of
the
dogwood
snow
of
in
bloom
and
crimson
tints
of
the
looked
on
the
where
the
cattle
were
lazily
grazing
soft
and
sweet
and
thin
came
the
faint
far
notes
of
the
looked
on
the
lanes
with
their
elder
and
blackberry
borders
looked
on
the
orchard
a
bloomy
sea
with
its
billows
of
blossoms
fair
was
the
scene
yet
suddenly
strange
and
all
unfamiliar
as
are
the
faces
of
friends
when
the
word
of
farewell
has
been
spoken
long
together
they
gazed
then
at
last
on
the
little
home
for
so
many
years
now
home
no
longer
forever
rested
their
tearless
eyes
in
the
silent
rapture
of
anguish
up
on
the
morning
air
no
column
of
smoke
from
the
chimney
wavering
silver
and
azure
rose
fading
and
brightening
ever
shut
was
the
door
where
yesterday
morning
the
children
were
playing
lit
with
a
gleam
of
the
sun
the
window
stared
up
at
them
blindly
cold
was
the
hearthstone
now
and
the
place
was
forsaken
and
empty
empty
ah
no
but
haunted
by
thronging
and
tenderest
fancies
sad
recollections
of
all
that
had
been
of
sorrow
or
gladness
still
they
sat
there
in
the
glow
of
the
wide
red
fire
in
the
winter
still
they
sat
there
by
the
door
in
the
cool
of
the
still
summer
evening
still
the
mother
seemed
to
be
singing
her
babe
there
to
slumber
still
the
father
beheld
her
weep
the
child
that
was
dying
still
the
place
was
haunted
by
all
the
past
sorrow
and
gladness
neither
of
them
might
speak
for
the
thoughts
that
came
crowding
their
hearts
so
till
in
their
ignorant
trouble
aloud
the
children
lamented
then
was
the
spell
of
silence
dissolved
and
the
father
and
mother
burst
into
tears
and
embraced
and
turned
their
dim
eyes
to
the
westward
ohio
through
the
meadow
the
summer
sun
was
soft
and
bland
as
they
went
through
the
meadow
land
the
little
wind
that
hardly
shook
the
silver
of
the
sleeping
brook
blew
the
gold
hair
about
her
eyes
a
mystery
of
mysteries
so
he
must
often
pause
and
stoop
and
all
the
wanton
ringlets
loop
behind
her
dainty
ear
emprise
of
slow
event
and
many
sighs
across
the
stream
was
scarce
a
step
and
yet
she
feared
to
try
the
leap
and
he
to
still
her
sweet
alarm
must
lift
her
over
on
his
arm
she
could
not
keep
the
narrow
way
for
still
the
little
feet
would
stray
and
ever
must
he
bend
t
undo
the
tangled
grasses
from
her
shoe
from
dainty
rosebud
lips
in
pout
must
kiss
the
perfect
flowér
out
ah
little
coquette
fair
deceit
some
things
are
bitter
that
were
sweet
gone
is
it
the
shrewd
october
wind
brings
the
tears
into
her
eyes
does
it
blow
so
strong
that
she
must
fetch
her
breath
in
sudden
sighs
the
sound
of
his
horse
feet
grows
faint
the
rider
has
passed
from
sight
the
day
dies
out
of
the
crimson
west
and
coldly
falls
the
night
she
presses
her
tremulous
fingers
tight
against
her
closéd
eyes
and
on
the
lonesome
threshold
there
she
cowers
down
and
cries
the
sarcastic
fair
her
mouth
is
a
no
doubt
as
the
poet
sings
but
within
her
lips
the
petals
lurks
a
cruel
bee
that
stings
rapture
in
my
rhyme
i
fable
anguish
feigning
that
my
love
is
dead
playing
at
a
game
of
sadness
singing
hope
forever
fled
trailing
the
slow
robes
of
mourning
grieving
with
the
player
art
with
the
languid
palms
of
sorrow
folded
on
a
dancing
heart
i
must
mix
my
love
with
lest
the
draught
should
make
me
mad
i
must
make
believe
at
sorrow
lest
i
perish
dead
i
something
lies
in
the
room
over
against
my
own
the
windows
are
lit
with
a
ghastly
bloom
of
candles
burning
alone
untrimmed
and
all
aflare
in
the
ghastly
silence
there
ii
people
go
by
the
door
tiptoe
holding
their
breath
and
hush
the
talk
that
they
held
before
lest
they
should
waken
death
that
is
awake
all
night
there
in
the
candlelight
iii
the
cat
upon
the
stairs
watches
with
flamy
eye
for
the
sleepy
one
who
shall
unawares
let
her
go
stealing
by
she
softly
softly
purrs
and
claws
at
the
banisters
iv
the
bird
from
out
its
dream
breaks
with
a
sudden
song
that
stabs
the
sense
like
a
sudden
scream
the
hound
the
whole
night
long
howls
to
the
moonless
sky
so
far
and
starry
and
high
the
doubt
she
sits
beside
the
low
window
in
the
pleasant
with
her
face
turned
to
the
sunset
reading
a
book
of
rhyme
and
the
of
the
sunset
stolen
into
the
dainty
nook
where
she
sits
in
her
sacred
beauty
lies
crimson
on
the
book
o
beautiful
eyes
so
tender
brown
eyes
so
tender
and
dear
did
you
leave
your
reading
a
moment
just
now
as
i
passed
near
maybe
is
the
sunset
flushes
her
features
so
maybe
is
the
lover
passion
she
reads
of
in
the
tale
o
darling
and
darling
and
darling
if
i
dared
to
trust
my
thought
if
i
dared
to
believe
what
i
must
not
believe
what
no
one
ought
we
would
read
together
the
poem
of
the
love
that
never
died
the
passionate
story
come
true
and
glorified
the
thorn
every
rose
you
sang
has
its
thorn
but
this
has
none
i
know
she
clasped
my
rival
rose
over
her
breast
of
snow
i
bowed
to
hide
my
pain
with
a
man
unskilful
art
i
moved
my
lips
and
could
not
say
the
thorn
was
in
my
heart
the
mysteries
once
on
my
mother
breast
a
child
i
crept
holding
my
breath
there
safe
and
sad
lay
shuddering
and
wept
at
the
dark
mystery
of
death
weary
and
weak
and
worn
with
all
unrest
spent
with
the
strife
o
mother
let
me
weep
upon
thy
breast
at
the
sad
mystery
of
life
the
battle
in
the
clouds
the
day
had
been
one
of
dense
mists
and
rains
and
much
of
general
hooker

was
fought
above
the
clouds
on
the
top
of

of
the
battle
before
where
the
dews
and
the
rains
of

have
their
fountain
like
its
thunder
and
its
lightning
our
brave
burst
on
the
foe
up
above
the
clouds
on
freedom

raining
like
water
on
the

down
below

green

that

in

the
two

to

in
memory
of
the
event
before
atlanta
i
the
colonel
rode
by
his
in
the
pleasant
morning
sun
that
glanced
from
him
far
off
to
shine
on
the
crouching
rebel
picket
gun
ii
from
his
command
the
captain
strode
out
with
a
grave
salute
and
talked
with
the
colonel
as
he
rode
the
picket
levelled
his
piece
to
shoot
iii
the
colonel
rode
and
the
captain
walked
the
arm
of
the
picket
tired
their
faces
almost
touched
as
they
talked
and
swerved
from
his
aim
the
picket
fired
iv
the
captain
fell
at
the
horse
feet
wounded
and
hurt
to
death
calling
upon
a
name
that
was
sweet
as
god
is
good
with
his
dying
breath
and
the
colonel
that
leaped
from
his
horse
and
knelt
to
close
the
eyes
so
dim
a
high
remorse
for
god
mercy
felt
knowing
the
shot
was
meant
for
him
vi
and
he
whispered
under
his
breath
the
name
of
his
own
young
wife
for
love
that
had
made
his
friend
peace
with
death
alone
could
make
his
with
life
bereaved
the
passionate
cling
to
the
honeysuckles
hearts
in
and
out
at
the
open
window
the
twittering
darts
and
the
sun
is
bright
june
is
young
and
warm
and
sweet
the
morning
is
gay
and
new
glimmers
yet
the
grass
of
the
with
fragrant
dew
and
the
sun
is
bright
from
the
mill
upon
the
stream
a
busy
murmur
swells
on
to
the
pasture
go
the
cattle
lowing
with
tinkling
bells
and
the
sun
is
bright
she
gathers
his
playthings
up
and
dreamily
puts
them
by
children
are
playing
in
the
meadow
she
hears
their
joyous
cry
and
the
sun
is
bright
she
sits
and
clasps
her
brow
and
looks
with
swollen
eyes
on
the
landscape
that
reels
and
dances
to
herself
she
softly
cries
and
the
sun
is
bright
the
the
lonesome
graveyard
lieth
a
deep
with
silent
waves
of
snow
all
white
and
billowed
over
the
hidden
graves
the
come
in
the
morning
flocking
and
fluttering
low
and
light
on
the
graveyard
brambles
and
twitter
there
in
the
snow
the
singer
old
and
weary
looks
out
from
his
narrow
room
ah
me
but
my
thoughts
are
haunting
a
graveyard
gloom
where
all
the
past
is
buried
and
dead
these
many
years
under
the
drifted
whiteness
of
frozen
falls
of
tears
poor
birds
that
know
not
summer
nor
sun
nor
flowèrs
fair
only
the
graveyard
brambles
and
graves
and
winter
air
vagary
up
and
down
the
dusty
street
i
hurry
with
my
burning
feet
against
my
face
the
beat
fierce
from
the
of
heat
deep
in
my
heart
the
vision
is
of
meadow
grass
and
meadow
trees
blown
silver
in
the
summer
breeze
and
ripe
red
hillside
strawberries
my
sense
the
city
tumult
fills
the
tumult
that
about
me
reels
of
strokes
and
cries
and
feet

from

about
the

all
lit
with

some
spell

on

i

a
memory
of
the

a
dream
of
happiness

unto
myself
that

with

burning

the
children
sit
by
the
fireside
with
their
little
faces
in
bloom
and
behind
the
mother
looking
out
of
the
gloom
flushes
in
cheek
and
forehead
with
a
light
and
sudden
start
but
the
father
sits
there
silent
from
the
firelight
apart
now
what
dost
thou
see
in
the
embers
tell
it
to
me
my
child
whispers
the
mother
to
her
daughter
sweet
and
mild
o
i
see
a
sky
and
a
moon
in
the
coals
and
ashes
there
and
under
two
are
walking
in
a
garden
of
flowers
so
fair
a
lady
gay
and
her
lover
talking
with
words
not
to
waken
the
dreaming
flowers
and
the
sleepy
little
birds
back
in
the
gloom
the
mother
shrinks
with
a
sudden
sigh
now
what
dost
thou
see
in
the
embers
cries
the
father
to
the
boy
o
i
see
a
go
in
at
the
church
door
ladies
in
silk
and
knights
in
steel
a
hundred
of
them
and
more
the
bride
face
is
as
white
as
a
lily
and
the
groom
head
is
white
as
snow
and
without
with
plumes
and
tapers
a
funeral
paces
slow
loudly
then
laughed
the
father
and
shouted
again
for
cheer
and
called
to
the
drowsy
housemaid
to
fetch
him
a
pipe
and
beer
avery
niagara
i
all
night
long
they
heard
in
the
houses
beside
the
shore
heard
or
seemed
to
hear
through
the
multitudinous
roar
out
of
the
hell
of
the
rapids
as
a
lost
soul
cries
heard
and
could
not
believe
and
the
morning
mocked
their
eyes
showing
where
wildest
and
fiercest
the
waters
leaped
up
and
ran
raving
round
him
and
past
the
visage
of
a
man
clinging
or
seeming
to
cling
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
that
caught
fast
in
the
rocks
below
scarce
out
of
the
surges
raught
was
it
a
life
could
it
be
to
yon
slender
hope
that
clung
shrill
above
all
the
tumult
the
answering
terror
rung
ii
under
the
weltering
rapids
a
boat
from
the
bridge
is
drowned
over
the
rocks
the
lines
of
another
are
tangled
and
wound
and
the
long
fateful
hours
of
the
morning
have
wasted
soon
as
it
had
been
in
some
blessed
trance
and
now
it
is
noon
hurry
now
with
the
raft
but
o
build
it
strong
and
stanch
and
to
the
lines
and
treacherous
rocks
look
well
as
you
launch
over
the
foamy
tops
of
the
waves
and
their
sides
over
the
hidden
reefs
and
through
the
embattled
tides
onward
rushes
the
raft
with
many
a
lurch
and
leap
lord
if
it
strike
him
loose
from
the
hold
he
scarce
can
keep
no
through
all
peril
unharmed
it
reaches
him
harmless
at
last
and
to
its
proven
strength
he
lashes
his
weakness
fast
now
for
the
shore
but
steady
steady
my
men
and
slow
taut
now
the
quivering
lines
now
slack
and
so
let
her
go
thronging
the
shores
around
stand
the
pitying
multitude
wan
as
his
own
are
their
looks
and
a
nightmare
seems
to
brood
heavy
upon
them
and
heavy
the
silence
hangs
on
all
save
for
the
rapids
plunge
and
the
thunder
of
the
fall
but
on
a
sudden
thrills
from
the
people
still
and
pale
chorussing
his
unheard
despair
a
desperate
wail
caught
on
a
lurking
point
of
rock
it
sways
and
swings
sport
of
the
pitiless
waters
the
raft
to
which
he
clings
iii
all
the
long
afternoon
it
idly
swings
and
sways
and
on
the
shore
the
crowd
lifts
up
its
hands
and
prays
lifts
to
heaven
and
wrings
the
hands
so
helpless
to
save
prays
for
the
mercy
of
god
on
him
whom
the
rock
and
the
wave
battle
for
fettered
betwixt
them
and
who
amidst
their
strife
struggles
to
help
his
helpers
and
fights
so
hard
for
his
life
tugging
at
rope
and
at
reef
while
men
weep
and
women
swoon
priceless
second
by
second
so
wastes
the
afternoon
and
it
is
sunset
now
and
another
boat
and
the
last
down
to
him
from
the
bridge
through
the
rapids
has
safely
passed
iv
wild
through
the
crowd
comes
flying
a
man
that
nothing
can
stay
maddening
against
the
gate
that
is
locked
athwart
his
way
no
we
keep
the
bridge
for
them
that
can
help
him
you
tell
us
who
are
you
his
brother
god
help
you
both
pass
through
wild
with
wide
arms
of
imploring
he
calls
aloud
to
him
unto
the
face
of
his
brother
scarce
seen
in
the
distance
dim
but
in
the
roar
of
the
rapids
his
fluttering
words
are
lost
as
in
a
wind
of
autumn
the
leaves
of
autumn
are
tossed
and
from
the
bridge
he
sees
his
brother
sever
the
rope
holding
him
to
the
raft
and
rise
secure
in
his
hope
sees
all
as
in
a
dream
the
terrible
pageantry
populous
shores
the
woods
the
sky
the
birds
flying
free
sees
then
the
form
that
spent
with
effort
and
fasting
and
fear
flings
itself
feebly
and
fails
of
the
boat
that
is
lying
so
near
caught
in
the
clutch
of
the
rapids
and
rolled
and
hurled
headlong
on
to
the
cataract
brink
and
out
of
the
world
bopeep
a
pastoral
o
to
what
uses
shall
we
put
the
wildweed
flower
that
simply
blows
and
is
there
any
moral
shut
within
the
bosom
of
the
rose
tennyson
i
she
lies
upon
the
soft
enamoured
grass
i
the
wooing
shelter
of
an
and
at
her
feet
the
trancéd
brook
is
glass
and
in
the
blossoms
over
her
the
bee
hangs
charméd
of
his
sordid
industry
for
love
of
her
the
light
wind
will
not
pass
ii
her
golden
hair
blown
over
her
red
lips
that
seem
two
softly
breathed
apart
athwart
her
rounded
throat
like
sunshine
slips
her
small
hand
resting
on
her
beating
heart
the
crook
that
tells
her
peaceful
scarce
keeps
with
light
and
tremulous
iii
she
is
as
fair
as
any
shepherdess
that
ever
was
in
mask
or
christmas
scene
bright
silver
spangles
hath
she
on
her
dress
and
of
her
shoes
appears
the
sheen
and
she
hath
ribbons
of
such
blue
or
green
as
best
suits
pastoral
people
comeliness
iv
she
sleeps
and
it
is
in
the
month
of
may
and
the
whole
land
is
full
of
the
delight
of
music
and
sweet
scents
and
all
the
day
the
sun
is
gold
the
moon
is
pearl
all
night
and
like
a
paradise
the
world
is
bright
and
like
a
young
girl
hopes
the
world
is
gay
so
waned
the
hours
and
while
her
beauteous
sleep
was
blest
with
many
a
happy
dream
of
love
untended
still
her
silly
vagrant
sheep
afar
from
that
young
shepherdess
did
rove
along
the
vales
and
through
the
gossip
grove
daisied
meads
and
up
the
thymy
steep
vi
then
for
it
happens
oft
when
harm
is
nigh
our
dreams
grow
haggard
till
at
last
we
wake
she
thought
that
from
the
little
runnel
by
there
crept
upon
a
sudden
forth
a
snake
and
stung
her
hand
and
fled
into
the
brake
whereat
she
sprang
up
with
a
bitter
cry
vii
and
wildly
over
all
that
place
did
look
and
could
not
spy
her
ingrate
wanton
flock
not
there
among
tall
grasses
by
the
brook
not
there
behind
the
rock
and
pitiless
echo
answered
with
a
mock
when
she
did
sorrow
that
she
was
forsook
viii
alas
the
scattered
sheep
might
not
be
found
and
long
and
loud
that
gentle
maid
did
weep
till
in
her
blurréd
sight
the
hills
went
round
and
circling
far
field
wood
and
stream
did
sweep
and
on
the
ground
the
miserable
bopeep
fell
and
forgot
her
troubles
in
a
swound
ix
when
she
awoke
the
sun
long
time
had
set
and
all
the
land
was
sleeping
in
the
moon
and
all
the
flowers
with
dim
sad
dews
were
wet
as
they
had
wept
to
see
her
in
that
swoon
it
was
about
the
night
noon
only
the
larger
stars
were
waking
yet
bopeep
the
fair
and
hapless
shepherdess
rose
from
her
swooning
in
a
sore
dismay
and
tried
to
smooth
her
damp
and
rumpled
dress
that
showed
in
truth
a
grievous
disarray
then
where
the
brook
the
wan
moon
mirror
lay
she
laved
her
eyes
and
curled
each
golden
tress
xi
and
looking
to
her
ribbons
if
they
were
as
ribbons
of
a
shepherdess
should
be
she
took
the
hat
that
she
was
wont
to
wear
bedecked
it
was
with
ribbons
flying
free
as
ever
man
in
opera
might
see
and
set
it
on
her
curls
of
yellow
hair
xii
and
i
will
go
and
seek
my
sheep
she
said
through
every
distant
land
until
i
die
but
when
they
bring
me
hither
cold
and
dead
let
me
beneath
these
lie
with
this
dear
faithful
lovely
runnel
nigh
here
where
my
cru
cru
cruel
sheep
have
fed
xiii
thus
sorrow
and
despair
make
bold
bopeep
and
forth
she
springs
and
hurries
on
her
way
across
the
lurking
rivulet
she
can
leap
no
sombre
forest
shall
her
quest
delay
no
crooked
vale
her
eager
steps
bewray
what
dreadeth
she
that
seeketh
her
lost
sheep
xiv
by
many
a
pond
where
timorous
with
clattering
cries
and
throbbing
wings
arose
by
many
a
pasture
where
the
herds
looked
in
their
unmoved
repose
long
through
the
lonesome
night
that
sad
one
goes
and
fills
the
solitude
with
wailing
words
xv
so
that
the
little
dreams
of
harm
snuggled
away
from
harm
beneath
the
weeds
the
violet
sleeping
on
the
clover
arm
wakes
and
is
cold
with
thoughts
of
dreadful
deeds
the
pensive
people
of
the
hark
with
a
mute
and
dolorous
alarm
xvi
and
the
fond
hearts
of
all
the
are
broken
in
compassion
of
her
woe
and
every
tender
little
bird
that
loves
feels
in
his
breast
a
sympathetic
throe
and
flowers
are
sad
wherever
she
may
go
and
hoarse
with
sighs
the
waterfalls
and
groves
xvii
the
pale
moon
droppeth
low
star
after
star
grows
faint
and
slumbers
in
the
gray
of
dawn
and
still
she
lingers
not
but
hurries
far
till
in
a
dreary
wilderness
withdrawn
through
tangled
woods
she
lorn
and
lost
moves
on
where
griffins
dire
and
dreadful
dragons
are
xviii
her
ribbons
all
are
dripping
with
the
dew
her
shoes
are
torn
and
stained
with
mire
her
tender
arms
the
angry
sharpness
rue
of
many
a
scraggy
thorn
and
envious
brier
and
poor
bopeep
with
no
sweet
pity
nigh
her
wrings
her
small
hands
and
knows
not
what
to
do
xix
and
on
that
crude
and
rugged
ground
she
sinks
and
soon
her
seeking
had
been
ended
there
but
through
the
trees
a
fearful
glimmer
shrinks
and
of
a
hermit
dwelling
she
is
at
the
dull
pane
a
taper
blinks
drowsed
with
long
vigils
and
the
morning
air
xx
thither
she
trembling
moves
and
at
the
door
falls
down
and
can
not
either
speak
or
stir
the
hermit
comes
with
no
white
beard
before
nor
coat
of
skins
nor
cap
of
shaggy
fur
it
was
a
comely
youth
that
lifted
her
and
to
his
hearth
and
to
his
breakfast
bore
xxi
arrayed
he
was
in
princeliest
attire
and
of
as
goodly
presence
sooth
was
he
as
any
little
maiden
might
admire
or
any
cat
might
see
my
poor
bopeep
he
sigheth
piteously
rest
here
and
warm
you
at
a
hermit
fire
xxii
she
looked
so
beautiful
there
mute
and
white
he
kissed
her
on
the
lips
and
on
the
eyes
the
most
a
prince
could
do
in
such
a
plight
but
chiefly
gazed
on
her
in
still
surprise
and
when
he
saw
her
lily
eyelids
rise
for
him
the
whole
world
had
no
fairer
sight
xxiii
rude
is
my
fare
a
bit
of
venison
steak
a
dish
of
honey
and
a
glass
of
wine
with
clean
white
bread
is
the
poor
feast
i
make
be
served
i
pray
i
think
this
flask
is
fine
he
said
hard
is
this
hermit
life
of
mine
this
day
i
will
its
weariness
forsake
xxiv
and
then
he
told
her
how
it
chanced
that
he
king
cole
son
in
that
forest
held
his
court
and
the
sole
reason
that
there
seemed
to
be
was
he
was
being
hermit
there
for
sport
but
he
confessed
the
life
was
not
his
forte
and
therewith
both
laughed
out
right
jollily
xxv
and
sly
bopeep
forgot
her
sheep
again
in
gay
discourse
with
that
engaging
youth
love
hath
such
sovran
remedies
for
pain
but
then
he
was
a
handsome
prince
in
truth
and
both
were
young
and
both
were
silly
sooth
and
everything
to
love
but
love
seems
vain
xxvi
they
took
them
down
the
book
that
this
young
anchorite
predecessor
kept
a
holy
seer
and
through
it
they
did
look
sometimes
their
idle
eyes
together
crept
sometimes
their
lips
but
still
the
leaves
they
swept
until
they
found
a
shepherd
pictured
crook
xxvii
and
underneath
was
writ
it
should
befall
on
such
a
day
in
such
a
month
and
year
a
maiden
fair
a
young
prince
brave
and
tall
by
such
a
chance
should
come
together
here
they
were
the
people
that
was
very
clear
o
love
the
prince
said
let
us
read
it
all
xxviii
and
thus
the
hermit
prophecy
ran
on
though
she
her
lost
sheep
wist
not
where
to
find
yet
should
she
bid
her
weary
care
begone
and
banish
every
doubt
from
her
sweet
mind
they
with
their
little
tails
behind
homeward
would
go
if
they
were
left
alone
xxix
they
closed
the
book
and
in
her
happy
eyes
the
prince
read
truth
and
love
forevermore
better
than
any
hermit
prophecies
they
passed
together
from
the
cavern
door
embraced
they
turned
to
look
at
it
once
more
and
over
it
beheld
the
glad
sun
rise
xxx
that
streamed
before
them
aisles
of
dusk
and
gold
under
the
arches
of
the
wood
and
forth
they
went
tranced
in
each
other
hold
down
through
that
rare
and
luminous
solitude
their
happy
hearts
enchanted
in
the
mood
of
morning
and
of
may
and
romance
old
xxxi
sometimes
the
saucy
leaves
would
kiss
her
cheeks
and
he
must
kiss
their
wanton
kiss
away
to
die
beneath
her
feet
the
seeks
the
quivering
aspen
feels
a
fine
dismay
and
many
a
scented
blossom
on
the
spray
in
odorous
sighs
its
passionate
longing
speaks
xxxii
and
forth
they
went
down
to
that
stately
stream
bowed
over
by
the
ghostly
sycamores
awearily
as
if
some
heavy
dream
held
them
in
languor
but
whose
opulent
shores
with
pearléd
shells
and
dusts
of
precious
ores
were
tremulous
brilliance
in
the
morning
beam
xxxiii
where
waited
them
beside
the
lustrous
sand
a
shallop
sleeping
on
the
flood
and
smoothly
wafted
from
the
hither
strand
across
the
calm
broad
stream
they
lightly
rode
under
them
still
the
silver
fishes
stood
the
eager
lilies
on
the
other
land
xxxiv
beckonéd
them
but
where
the
castle
shone
with
diamonded
turrets
and
a
wall
of
pearl
and
costly
stone
their
vision
to
its
peerless
splendor
thrall
the
maiden
fair
the
young
prince
brave
and
tall
thither
with
light
unlingering
feet
pressed
on
xxxv
a
gallant
train
to
meet
this
loving
pair
in
silk
and
steel
moves
from
the
castle
door
and
up
the
broad
and
ringing
castle
stair
they
go
with
gleeful
minstrelsy
before
and
hail
our
prince
and
princess
evermore
from
all
the
happy
throng
is
greeting
there
xxxvi
and
in
the
hall
the
prince
sire
king
cole
sitting
with
crown
and
royal
ermine
on
his
fiddlers
three
behind
with
pipe
and
bowl
rises
and
moves
to
lift
his
kneeling
son
greeting
his
bride
with
kisses
many
a
one
and
tears
and
laughter
from
his
jolly
soul
xxxvii
then
both
his
children
to
a
window
leads
that
over
daisied
looks
out
and
shows
bopeep
where
her
lost
flock
wide
feeds
and
every
frolic
lambkin
leaps
about
she
hears
that
lazy
shepherd
shout
slow
pausing
from
his
pipe
of
mellow
reeds
xxxviii
and
turning
peers
into
her
prince
eyes
then
caught
and
clasped
against
her
prince
heart
upon
her
breath
her
answer
wordless
dies
and
leaves
her
gratitude
to
sweeter
art
to
lips
from
which
the
bloom
shall
never
part
to
looks
wherein
the
summer
never
dies
while
she
sang
i
she
sang
and
i
heard
the
singing
far
out
of
the
wretched
past
of
in
the
meadow
in
a
breathing
of
the
blast
cold
through
the
clouds
of
sunset
the
thin
red
sunlight
shone
staining
the
gloom
of
the
woodland
where
i
walked
and
dreamed
alone
and
glinting
with
chilly
splendor
the
meadow
under
the
hill
where
the
lingering
larks
were
lurking
in
the
sere
grass
hid
and
still
out
they
burst
with
their
singing
their
singing
so
loud
and
gay
they
made
in
the
heart
of
october
a
sudden
ghastly
may
that
faded
and
ceased
with
their
singing
the
thin
red
sunlight
paled
and
through
the
boughs
above
me
the
wind
of
evening
wailed
wailed
and
the
light
of
evening
out
of
the
heaven
died
and
from
the
marsh
by
the
river
the
lonesome
killdee
cried
ii
the
song
is
done
but
a
phantom
of
music
haunts
the
chords
that
thrill
with
its
subtile
presence
and
grieve
for
the
dying
words
and
in
the
years
that
are
perished
far
back
in
the
wretched
past
i
see
on
the
meadows
the
white
snow
falling
fast
falling
and
falling
and
falling
as
still
and
cold
as
death
on
the
bloom
of
the
odorous
orchard
on
the
small
meek
flowers
beneath
on
the
roofs
of
the
on
the
long
silent
street
where
its
plumes
are
soiled
and
broken
under
the
passing
feet
on
the
green
crest
of
the
woodland
on
the
cornfields
far
apart
on
the
cowering
birds
in
the
gable
and
on
my
desolate
heart
a
poet
from
wells
where
truth
in
secret
lay
he
saw
the
midnight
stars
by
day
o
marvellous
gift
the
many
cried
o
cruel
gift
his
voice
replied
the
stars
were
far
and
cold
and
high
that
glimmered
in
the
noonday
sky
he
yearned
toward
the
sun
in
vain
that
warmed
the
lives
of
other
men
convention
he
falters
on
the
threshold
she
lingers
on
the
stair
can
it
be
that
was
his
footstep
can
it
be
that
she
is
there
without
is
tender
yearning
and
tender
love
is
within
they
can
hear
each
other
but
a
wooden
door
is
between
the
poet
friends
the
robin
sings
in
the
elm
the
cattle
stand
beneath
sedate
and
grave
with
great
brown
eyes
and
fragrant
they
listen
to
the
flattered
bird
the
stupid
things
and
they
never
understand
a
word
of
all
the
robin
sings
no
love
lost
a
romance
of
travel
bertha
from
i
on
your
heart
i
feign
myself
fallen
ah
heavier
burden
darling
of
sorrow
and
pain
than
ever
shall
rest
there
i
take
you
into
these
friendless
arms
of
mine
that
you
can
not
escape
me
closer
and
closer
i
fold
you
and
tell
you
all
and
you
listen
just
as
you
used
at
home
and
you
let
my
sobs
and
my
silence
speak
when
the
words
will
not
come
and
you
understand
and
forgive
me
ah
no
no
but
i
write
with
the
wretched
bravado
of
distance
what
you
must
read
unmoved
by
the
pity
too
far
for
entreaty
ii
well
i
could
never
have
loved
him
but
when
he
sought
me
and
asked
me
when
to
the
men
that
offered
their
lives
the
love
of
a
woman
seemed
so
little
to
give
i
promised
the
love
that
he
asked
me
sent
him
to
war
with
my
kiss
on
his
lips
and
thought
him
my
hero
afterward
came
the
doubt
and
out
of
long
question
came
that
great
defeat
and
the
heart
of
the
nation
was
withered
mine
leaped
high
with
the
awful
relief
won
of
death
but
the
horror
then
of
the
crime
that
was
wrought
in
that
guilty
moment
of
rapture
guilty
as
if
my
will
had
winged
the
bullet
that
struck
him
clung
to
me
day
and
night
and
dreaming
i
saw
him
forever
looking
through
with
sorrowful
eyes
of
upbraiding
or
in
the
moonlight
lying
gray
or
dimly
approaching
holding
toward
me
his
arms
that
still
held
nearer
and
nearer
folded
about
me
at
last
and
i
would
i
had
died
in
the
fever
better
then
than
now
and
better
than
ever
hereafter
iii
weary
as
some
illusion
of
fever
to
me
was
the
ocean
scourged
with
bitter
rains
and
wandering
always
onward
from
sky
to
sky
with
endless
processions
of
surges
knowing
not
life
nor
death
but
since
the
light
was
the
first
day
only
enduring
unrest
till
the
darkness
possess
it
the
last
day
over
its
desolate
depths
we
voyaged
away
from
all
living
all
the
world
behind
us
waned
into
vaguest
remoteness
names
and
faces
and
scenes
recurred
like
that
broken
remembrance
of
the
anterior
bodiless
life
of
the
spirit
the
trouble
of
a
bewildered
brain
or
the
touch
of
the
hand
that
created
and
when
the
ocean
ceased
at
last
like
a
faded
illusion
europe
itself
seemed
only
a
vision
of
eld
and
of
sadness
naught
but
the
dark
in
my
soul
remained
to
me
constant
and
real
growing
and
taking
the
thoughts
bereft
of
happier
uses
blotting
all
sense
of
lapse
from
the
days
that
with
swift
iteration
were
and
were
not
they
fable
the
bright
days
the
fleetest
these
that
had
nothing
to
give
that
had
nothing
to
bring
or
to
promise
went
as
one
day
alone
for
me
was
no
alternation
save
from
my
dull
despair
to
wild
and
reckless
rebellion
when
the
regret
for
my
sin
was
turned
to
ruthless
when
i
hated
him
whose
love
had
made
me
its
victim
through
his
faith
and
my
falsehood
yet
claiming
me
then
i
was
smitten
with
so
great
remorse
such
grief
for
him
and
compassion
that
if
he
could
have
come
back
to
me
i
had
welcomed
and
loved
him
more
than
man
ever
was
loved
alas
for
me
that
another
holds
his
place
in
my
heart
evermore
alas
that
i
listened
when
the
words
whose
daring
lured
my
spirit
and
lulled
it
seemed
to
take
my
blame
away
with
my
will
of
resistance
do
not
make
haste
to
condemn
me
my
will
was
the
will
of
a
woman
fain
to
be
broken
by
love
yet
unto
the
last
i
endeavored
what
i
could
to
be
faithful
still
to
the
past
and
my
penance
and
as
we
stood
that
night
in
the
old
roman
garden
together
by
the
fountain
whose
passionate
tears
but
now
had
implored
me
in
his
pleading
voice
and
he
waited
my
answer
i
told
him
all
that
had
been
before
of
delusion
and
guilt
and
conjured
him
not
to
darken
his
fate
with
mine
the
costly
endeavor
only
was
subtler
betrayal
o
me
from
the
pang
of
confession
sprang
what
strange
delight
as
i
tore
from
its
lurking
that
horror
brooded
upon
so
long
with
the
hope
that
at
last
i
might
see
it
through
his
eyes
unblurred
by
the
tears
that
disordered
my
vision
oh
with
what
rapturous
triumph
i
humbled
my
spirit
before
him
that
he
might
lift
me
and
soothe
me
and
make
that
dreary
remembrance
all
this
confused
present
seem
only
some
sickness
of
fancy
only
a
morbid
folly
no
certain
and
actual
trouble
if
from
that
refuge
i
fled
with
words
of
too
feeble
denial
bade
him
hate
me
with
sobs
that
entreated
his
tenderest
pity
moved
mute
lips
and
left
the
meaningless
farewell
unuttered
she
that
never
has
loved
alone
can
wholly
condemn
me
iv
how
could
he
other
than
follow
my
heart
had
bidden
him
follow
nor
had
my
lips
forbidden
and
rome
yet
glimmered
behind
me
when
my
soul
yearned
towards
his
from
the
sudden
forlornness
of
absence
everywhere
his
face
looked
from
vanishing
glimpses
of
faces
everywhere
his
voice
reached
my
senses
in
fugitive
cadence
sick
through
the
storied
cities
with
wretched
hopes
and
upbraidings
of
my
own
heart
for
its
hopes
i
went
from
wonder
to
wonder
blind
to
them
all
or
only
beholding
them
wronged
and
related
through
some
trick
of
wayward
thought
to
myself
and
my
trouble
not
surprise
nor
regret
but
a
fierce
precipitate
gladness
sent
the
blood
to
my
throbbing
heart
when
i
found
him
in
venice
waiting
for
you
he
whispered
you
would
so
i
answered
him
nothing
father
whose
humor
grows
more
silent
and
ever
more
absent
changed
in
all
but
love
for
me
since
the
death
of
my
mother
willing
to
see
me
contented
at
last
and
trusting
us
wholly
left
us
together
alone
in
our
world
of
love
and
of
beauty
so
by
noon
and
by
night
we
two
have
wandered
in
venice
where
the
beautiful
lives
in
vivid
and
constant
caprices
yet
where
the
charm
is
so
perfect
that
nothing
fantastic
surprises
more
than
in
dreams
and
one
life
with
the
life
of
the
city
is
blended
in
a
luxurious
calm
and
the
tumult
without
and
beyond
it
seems
but
the
emptiest
fable
of
vain
aspiration
and
labor
yes
from
all
that
makes
this
venice
sole
among
cities
peerless
forever
the
still
lagoons
that
sleep
in
the
sunlight
lulled
by
their
the
night
mysterious
waters
lit
through
their
shadowy
depths
by
stems
of
splendor
that
blossom
into
the
lamps
that
float
like
flamy
lotuses
over
narrow
and
secret
canals
that
dimly
gleaming
and
glooming
under
and
numberless
arches
of
bridges
list
no
sound
but
the
dip
of
the
gondolier
oar
and
his
warning
cried
from
corner
to
corner
the
sad
superb
canalazzo
mirroring
marvellous
grandeur
and
beauty
and
dreaming
of
glory
out
of
the
empty
homes
of
her
lords
departed
the
footways
wandering
sunless
between
the
walls
of
the
houses
and
stealing
glimpses
through
rusted
cancelli
of
lurking
greenness
of
gardens
flowers
and
broken
statues
and
mouldering
frescos
thoroughfares
filled
with
traffic
and
throngs
ever
ebbing
and
flowing
to
and
from
the
heart
of
the
city
whose
pride
and
devotion
lifting
high
the
bells
of
mark
like
prayers
unto
heaven
stretch
a
marble
embrace
of
palaces
toward
the
cathedral
orient
gorgeous
and
flushed
with
color
and
light
like
the
morning
from
the
lingering
waste
that
is
not
yet
ruin
in
venice
and
her
phantasmal
show
through
all
of
being
and
doing
came
a
strange
joy
to
us
untouched
by
regret
for
the
idle
days
without
yesterdays
that
died
into
nights
without
morrows
here
in
our
paradise
of
love
we
reigned
as
in
the
youth
of
the
world
in
the
days
before
evil
and
conscience
ah
in
our
fair
lost
world
was
neither
fearing
nor
doubting
neither
the
sickness
of
old
remorse
nor
the
gloom
of
foreboding
only
the
glad
surrender
of
all
individual
being
unto
him
whom
i
loved
and
in
whose
tender
possession
my
soul
reposed
from
its
anguish
of
these
things
i
write
you
as
of
another
experience
part
of
my
own
they
no
longer
seem
to
me
now
through
the
doom
that
darkens
the
past
like
the
future
vi
golden
the
sunset
gleamed
above
the
city
behind
us
out
of
a
city
of
clouds
as
fairy
and
lovely
as
venice
while
we
looked
at
the
of
purple
and
yellow
far
on
the
rim
of
the
sea
whose
light
and
musical
surges
broke
along
the
sands
with
a
faint
reiterant
sadness
but
when
the
sails
had
darkened
into
black
wings
through
the
twilight
sweeping
away
into
night
past
the
broken
tombs
of
the
hebrews
homeward
we
sauntered
slowly
through
blossomy
alleys
so
drew
near
the
boat
by
errant
and
careless
approaches
entered
and
left
with
indolent
pulses
the
lido
behind
us
all
the
sunset
had
paled
and
the
campanili
of
venice
rose
like
the
masts
of
a
mighty
fleet
moored
there
in
the
water
lights
flashed
furtively
to
and
fro
through
the
deepening
twilight
massed
in
one
thick
shade
lay
the
gardens
the
numberless
islands
lay
like
shadows
upon
the
lagoons
and
on
us
as
we
loitered
by
their
enchanted
coasts
a
spell
of
ineffable
sweetness
fell
and
made
us
at
one
with
them
and
silent
and
blissful
shadows
we
seemed
that
drifted
on
through
a
being
of
shadow
vague
indistinct
to
ourselves
unbounded
by
hope
or
remembrance
yet
we
knew
the
beautiful
night
as
it
grew
from
the
evening
far
beneath
us
and
far
above
us
the
vault
of
the
heavens
glittered
and
darkened
and
now
the
moon
that
had
haunted
the
daylight
thin
and
pallid
dimmed
the
stars
with
her
fulness
of
splendor
and
over
all
the
lagoons
fell
the
silvery
rain
of
the
moonbeams
as
in
the
song
the
young
girls
sang
while
their
gondolas
passed
us
sang
in
the
joy
of
love
or
youth
desire
of
loving
balmy
night
of
the
south
o
perfect
night
of
the
summer
night
of
the
distant
dark
of
the
near
and
tender
effulgence
how
from
my
despair
are
thy
peace
and
loveliness
frightened
for
while
our
boat
lay
there
at
the
will
of
the
light
undulations
idle
as
if
our
mood
imbued
and
controlled
it
yet
ever
seeming
to
bear
us
on
athwart
those
shining
expanses
out
to
shining
seas
beyond
pursuit
or
returning
there
while
we
lingered
and
lingered
and
would
not
break
from
our
rapture
down
the
mirrored
night
another
gondola
drifted
nearer
and
slowly
nearer
our
own
and
moonlighted
faces
stared
and
that
sweet
trance
grew
a
rigid
and
dreadful
possession
which
if
no
dream
indeed
yet
mocked
with
such
semblance
of
dreaming
that
as
it
happens
in
dreams
when
a
dear
face
stooping
to
kiss
us
takes
ere
the
lips
have
touched
some
malign
and
horrible
aspect
face
faded
away
and
the
face
of
the
dead
of
that
other
flashed
on
mine
and
writhing
through
every
change
of
emotion
wild
amaze
and
scorn
accusation
and
pitiless
mocking
vanished
into
the
swoon
whose
blackness
encompassed
and
hid
me
philip
i
am
not
sure
i
own
that
if
first
i
had
seen
my
delusion
when
i
saw
last
night
i
should
be
so
ready
to
give
you
now
your
promises
back
and
hold
myself
nothing
above
you
that
it
is
mine
to
offer
a
freedom
you
never
could
ask
for
yet
believe
me
indeed
from
no
bitter
heart
i
release
you
you
are
as
free
of
me
now
as
though
i
had
died
in
the
battle
or
as
i
never
had
lived
nay
if
it
is
mine
to
forgive
you
go
without
share
of
the
blame
that
could
hardly
be
all
upon
your
side
ghosts
are
not
sensitive
things
yet
after
my
death
in
the
papers
sometimes
a
harrowing
doubt
assailed
this
impalpable
essence
had
i
done
so
well
to
plead
my
cause
at
that
moment
when
your
consent
must
be
yielded
less
to
the
lover
than
soldier
not
so
well
i
was
answered
by
that
ethereal
conscience
ghosts
have
about
them
and
not
so
nobly
or
wisely
as
might
be
truly
i
loved
you
then
as
now
i
love
you
no
longer
i
was
a
prisoner
then
and
this
doubt
in
the
languor
of
sickness
came
and
it
clung
to
my
convalescence
and
grew
to
the
purpose
after
my
days
of
captivity
ended
to
seek
you
and
solve
it
and
if
i
haply
had
erred
to
undo
the
wrong
and
release
you
well
you
have
solved
me
the
doubt
i
dare
to
trust
that
you
wept
me
just
a
little
at
first
when
you
heard
of
me
dead
in
the
battle
for
we
were
plighted
you
know
and
even
in
this
saintly
humor
i
would
scarce
like
to
believe
that
my
loss
had
merely
relieved
you
yet
i
say
it
was
prudent
and
well
not
to
wait
for
my
coming
back
from
the
dead
if
it
may
be
i
sometimes
had
cherished
a
fancy
that
i
had
won
some
right
to
the
palm
with
the
pang
of
the
martyr
fondly
intended
perhaps
some
splendor
of
doubtless
all
that
was
a
folly
which
merciful
chances
have
spared
me
no
i
am
far
from
complaining
that
circumstance
coolly
has
ordered
matters
of
tragic
fate
in
such
a
commonplace
fashion
how
do
i
know
indeed
that
the
easiest
is
the
best
way
friendly
adieux
end
this
note
and
our
little
comedy
with
it
fanny
i
yes
i
promised
to
write
but
how
shall
i
write
to
you
darling
venice
we
reached
last
monday
wild
for
canals
and
for
color
palaces
prisons
lagoons
and
gondolas
bravoes
and
moonlight
all
the
mysterious
dreadful
beautiful
things
in
existence
fred
had
joined
us
at
naples
knowing
and
travelled
wise
in
the
prices
of
things
and
great
at
tempestuous
bargains
rich
in
the
costly
nothing
our
youthful
travellers
buy
here
at
a
prodigious
outlay
of
time
and
money
and
trouble
utter
confusion
of
facts
and
talking
the
wildest
of
pictures
pyramids
bills
and
examinations
of
luggage
passports
policemen
porters
and
how
he
got
through
his
tobacco
ignorant
handsome
brown
and
as
ever
annie
thinks
him
perfect
and
i
well
enough
for
a
brother
also
a
friend
of
fred
came
with
us
from
naples
to
venice
and
altogether
i
think
we
are
rather
agreeable
people
for
we
been
taking
our
pleasure
at
all
times
in
perfect
which
is
an
excellent
thing
that
you
understand
when
travelled
seen
recreation
and
cross
and
learnt
what
a
burden
frescos
for
instance
can
be
and
in
general
what
an
affliction
life
is
apt
to
become
among
the
antiques
and
old
masters
venice
we
thoroughly
done
and
it
perfectly
true
of
the
pictures
titians
and
tintorettos
and
palmas
and
paul
veroneses
neither
are
gondolas
fictions
but
verities
and
quite
as
the
heart
could
wish
and
one
finds
to
one
infinite
comfort
venice
just
as
unique
as
one
fondest
visions
have
made
it
palaces
and
mosquitoes
rise
from
the
water
together
and
in
the
city
streets
the
is
ebbing
and
flowing
several
inches
or
more
ah
let
me
not
wrong
thee
o
venice
fairest
forlornest
and
saddest
of
all
the
cities
and
dearest
dear
for
my
heart
has
won
here
deep
peace
from
cruel
confusion
and
in
this
lucent
air
whose
night
is
but
tenderer
fear
is
forever
dead
and
hope
has
put
on
the
immortal
there
and
you
need
not
laugh
i
coming
to
something
directly
one
thing
i
bought
you
a
chain
of
the
famous
fabric
of
venice
something
peculiar
and
quaint
and
of
such
a
delicate
texture
that
you
must
wear
it
embroidered
upon
a
riband
of
velvet
if
you
would
have
the
effect
of
its
exquisite
fineness
and
beauty
is
it
very
frail
i
asked
of
the
workman
who
made
it
strong
enough
if
you
will
to
bind
a
lover
signora
with
an
expensive
smile
was
bought
near
the
bridge
of
rialto
shylock
you
know
in
our
shopping
aunt
may
and
fred
do
the
talking
fred
begins
always
in
french
with
the
most
delicious
only
to
end
in
profoundest
humiliation
and
english
aunt
however
scorns
to
speak
any
tongue
but
italian
quanto
per
these
ones
here
and
what
did
you
say
was
the
prezzo
ah
troppo
caro
much
no
no
do
i
you
troppo
all
the
while
insists
that
the
gondolieri
shall
show
us
what
she
calls
titian
palazzo
and
pines
for
the
house
of
othello
annie
the
dear
little
goose
believes
in
fred
and
her
mother
with
an
enchanting
abandon
she
does
at
all
understand
them
but
she
has
some
twilight
views
of
their
cleverness
father
is
quiet
now
and
then
ventures
some
french
when
he
fancies
that
nobody
hears
him
in
an
aside
to
the
i
never
detect
him
buys
things
for
mother
and
me
with
a
quite
supernatural
sweetness
tolerates
all
fred
airs
and
is
indispensably
pleasant
ii
prattling
on
of
these
things
which
i
think
can
not
interest
deeply
so
i
hold
back
in
my
heart
its
dear
and
wonderful
secret
which
i
must
tell
you
at
last
however
i
falter
to
tell
you
fain
to
keep
it
all
my
own
for
a
little
while
longer
doubting
but
it
shall
lose
some
part
of
its
strangeness
and
sweetness
shared
with
another
and
fearful
that
even
may
not
find
it
just
the
marvel
that
i
do
and
thus
turn
our
friendship
to
hatred
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that
this
love
which
i
feel
is
eternal
must
have
begun
with
my
life
and
that
only
an
absence
was
ended
when
we
met
and
knew
in
our
souls
that
we
loved
one
another
for
from
the
first
was
no
doubt
the
earliest
hints
of
the
passion
whispered
to
girlhood
tremulous
dream
may
be
mixed
with
misgiving
but
when
the
very
love
comes
it
bears
no
vagueness
of
meaning
touched
by
its
truth
too
fine
to
be
felt
by
the
ignorant
senses
knowing
but
looks
and
utterance
soul
unto
soul
makes
confession
silence
to
silence
speaks
and
i
think
that
this
subtile
assurance
yet
unconfirmed
from
without
is
even
sweeter
and
dearer
than
the
perfected
bliss
that
comes
when
the
words
have
been
spoken
not
that
i
have
them
unsaid
now
but
was
delicious
to
ponder
all
the
miracle
over
and
clasp
it
and
keep
it
and
hide
it
while
i
beheld
him
you
know
with
looks
of
indifferent
languor
talking
of
other
things
and
felt
the
divine
contradiction
trouble
my
heart
below
and
yet
if
no
doubt
touched
our
passion
do
not
believe
for
that
our
love
has
been
wholly
unclouded
all
best
things
are
ours
when
pain
and
patience
have
won
them
peace
itself
would
mean
nothing
but
for
the
strife
that
preceded
triumph
of
love
is
greatest
when
peril
of
love
has
been
sorest
that
to
say
i
dare
say
i
only
repeating
what
said
well
then
of
all
wretched
things
in
the
world
a
mystery
clara
lurked
in
this
life
dear
to
mine
and
hopelessly
held
us
asunder
when
we
drew
nearest
together
and
all
but
his
speech
said
i
love
you
fred
had
known
him
at
college
and
then
had
found
him
at
naples
after
several
years
and
called
him
a
capital
fellow
thus
far
his
knowledge
went
and
beyond
this
began
to
run
shallow
over
troubled
ways
and
to
break
into
brilliant
conjecture
harder
by
far
to
endure
than
the
other
reticent
absence
absence
wherein
at
times
he
seemed
to
walk
like
one
troubled
by
an
uneasy
dream
whose
spell
is
not
broken
with
waking
but
it
returns
all
day
with
a
vivid
and
sudden
recurrence
like
a
remembered
event
of
the
past
that
was
closest
the
present
this
we
knew
from
himself
he
went
at
the
earliest
summons
when
the
rebellion
began
and
falling
terribly
wounded
into
the
enemy
hands
after
ages
of
sickness
and
prison
made
his
escape
at
last
and
returning
found
all
his
virtues
grown
out
of
recognition
and
shining
in
posthumous
splendor
found
all
changed
and
estranged
and
he
fancied
more
wonder
than
welcome
so
somewhat
heavy
of
heart
and
disabled
for
war
he
had
wandered
hither
to
europe
for
perfecter
peace
abruptly
his
silence
full
of
suggestion
and
sadness
made
here
a
chasm
between
us
but
we
spanned
the
chasm
with
conversational
bridges
else
talked
all
around
it
and
feigned
an
ignorance
of
it
with
that
absurd
pretence
which
is
always
so
painful
or
comic
just
as
you
happen
to
make
it
or
see
it
in
spite
of
our
fictions
severed
from
his
by
that
silence
my
heart
grew
ever
more
anxious
till
last
night
when
together
we
sat
in
piazza
san
marco
then
when
the
morrow
must
bring
us
parting
forever
it
might
be
taking
our
ices
al
fresco
some
strolling
minstrels
were
singing
airs
from
the
trovatore
i
noted
with
painful
observance
with
the
unwilling
minuteness
at
such
times
absolute
torture
all
that
brilliant
scene
for
which
i
cared
nothing
before
me

and

shone
on
by
numberless
lamps
that
flamed
round
the
perfect
piazza
set
in
the
splendid
frame
of
this
beautiful
picture
full
of
such
motley
life
and
so
altogether
venetian
then
we
rose
and
walked
where
the
lamps
were
blanched
by
the
moonlight
flooding
the
piazzetta
with
splendor
and
throwing
in
shadow
all
the
façade
of
saint
mark
with
its
pillars
and
horses
and
arches
but
the
sculptured
frondage
that
blossoms
over
the
arches
into
the
forms
of
saints
was
touched
with
tenderest
lucence
and
the
angel
that
stands
on
the
crest
of
the
vast
campanile
bathed
his
golden
vans
in
the
liquid
light
of
the
moonbeams
black

the
granite
pillars
that
lift
the
saint
and
the
lion
black
sank
the
island
campanili
from
distance
to
distance
over
the
charmèd
scene
there
brooded
a
presence
of
music
subtler
than
sound
and
felt
unheard
in
the
depth
of
the
spirit
how
can
i
gather
and
show
you
the
airy
threads
of
enchantment
woven
that
night
round
my
life
and
forever
wrought
into
my
being
as
in
our
boat
we
glided
away
from
the
glittering
city
dull
at
heart
i
felt
and
i
looked
at
the
lights
in
the
water
blurring
their
brilliance
with
tears
while
the
tresses
of
eddying
seaweed
whirled
in
the
ebbing
tide
like
the
tresses
of
drifting
seaward
from
in
the
moonshine
glistened
and
darkened
sad
and
vague
were
my
thoughts
and
full
of
fear
was
the
silence
and
when
he
turned
to
speak
at
last
i
trembled
to
hear
him
feeling
he
now
must
speak
of
his
love
and
his
life
and
its
secret
now
that
the
narrowing
chances
had
left
but
that
cruel
conclusion
else
the
ache
of
a
love
and
a
trouble
unuttered
better
my
feebleness
pleaded
the
dreariest
doubt
that
had
vexed
me
than
my
life
left
nothing
not
even
a
doubt
to
console
it
but
while
i
trembled
and
listened
his
broken
words
crumbled
to
silence
and
as
though
some
touch
of
fate
had
thrilled
him
with
warning
suddenly
from
me
he
turned
our
gondola
slipped
from
the
shadow
under
a
ship
lying
near
and
glided
into
the
moonlight
where
in
its
brightest
lustre
another
gondola
rested
saw
two
lovers
there
and
he
in
the
face
of
the
woman
saw
what
has
made
him
mine
my
own
belovèd
forever
mine
but
through
tribulation
and
awful
confusion
of
spirit
tears
that
i
think
of
with
smiles
and
sighs
i
remember
with
laughter
agonies
full
of
absurdity
keen
ridiculous
anguish
ending
in
depths
of
blissful
shame
and
heavenly
transports
iii
white
and
estranged
as
a
man
who
has
looked
on
a
spectre
he
mutely
sank
to
the
place
at
my
side
nor
while
we
returned
to
the
city
uttered
a
word
of
explaining
or
comment
or
comfort
but
only
with
his
incoherently
craved
my
forgiveness
and
patience
parted
and
left
me
to
spend
the
night
in
hysterical
vigils
tending
to
annie
supreme
dismay
and
postponing
our
journey
one
day
longer
at
least
for
i
went
to
bed
in
the
morning
firmly
rejecting
the
pity
of
friends
and
the
pleasures
of
travel
fixed
in
a
dreadful
purpose
never
to
get
any
better
later
however
i
rallied
when
fred
with
a
maddening
prologue
touching
the
cause
of
my
sickness
including
his
fever
at
jaffa
told
me
that
some
one
was
waiting
and
could
he
see
me
a
moment
see
me
certainly
not
or
yes
but
why
did
he
want
to
so
in
the
dishabille
of
a
and
an
languid
with
eloquent
wanness
of
eye
and
of
cheek
i
received
him
willing
to
touch
and
reproach
and
myself
by
my
pathos
which
with
a
reprobate
joy
i
wholly
forgot
the
next
instant
when
with
electric
words
few
swift
and
vivid
he
brought
me
through
a
brief
tempest
of
tears
to
this
heaven
of
sunshine
and
sweetness
yes
he
had
looked
on
a
ghost
the
phantom
of
love
that
was
perished
when
last
night
he
beheld
the
scene
of
which
i
have
told
you
for
to
the
woman
he
saw
there
his
troth
had
been
solemnly
plighted
ere
he
went
to
the
war
his
return
from
the
dead
found
her
absent
in
the
belief
of
his
death
and
hither
to
europe
he
followed
followed
to
seek
her
and
keep
if
she
would
the
promise
between
them
or
were
a
haunting
doubt
confirmed
to
break
it
and
free
her
then
at
naples
we
met
and
the
love
that
before
he
was
conscious
turned
his
life
toward
mine
laid
torturing
stress
to
the
purpose
whither
it
drove
him
forever
and
whence
forever
it
swerved
him
how
could
he
tell
me
his
love
with
this
terrible
burden
upon
him
how
could
he
linger
near
me
and
still
withhold
the
avowal
and
what
ruin
were
that
if
the
other
were
doubted
unjustly
and
should
prove
fatally
true
with
shame
he
confessed
he
had
faltered
clinging
to
guilty
delays
and
to
hopes
that
were
bitter
with
treason
up
to
the
eve
of
our
parting
and
then
the
last
anguish
was
spared
him
love
for
him
was
dead
but
the
heart
that
leaped
in
his
bosom
with
a
great
dumb
throb
of
joy
and
wonder
and
doubting
still
must
yield
to
the
spell
of
his
silencing
will
till
that
phantom
proved
an
actual
ghost
by
tests
of
the
daylight
such
as
speech
with
the
lady
father
and
now
could
i
pardon
nay
did
i
think
i
could
love
him
i
sobbingly
answered
i
thought
so
and
we
are
all
of
us
going
to
lago
di
como
with
an
ulterior
view
at
the
first
convenient
legation
patientest
darling
poor
fred
whose
sense
of
proper
never
was
touched
till
now
is
shocked
at
my
glad
and
i
am
pointed
out
as
an
awful
example
to
annie
figuring
all
she
must
never
be
but
oh
if
loves
me
postscript
since
he
has
shown
me
a
letter
in
which
he
absolves
and
forgives
her
philip
of
course
not
fred
and
the
of
course
and
not
annie
do
you
think
him
generous
noble
unselfish
heroic
well
i
glad
i
am
sure
if
fanny
supposes
she
happy
i
no
doubt
her
lover
is
good
and
noble
as
men
go
but
as
regards
his
release
of
a
woman
who
wholly
forgot
him
and
whom
he
loved
no
longer
for
one
whom
he
loves
and
who
loves
him
do
exactly
see
where
the
commences
the
song
the
oriole
sings
there
is
a
bird
that
comes
and
sings
in
the
professor
upon
the
english
oak
he
swings
and
tilts
and
tosses
in
the
breeze
i
know
his
name
i
know
his
note
that
so
with
rapture
takes
my
soul
like
flame
the
gold
beneath
his
throat
his
glossy
cope
is
black
as
coal
o
oriole
it
is
the
song
you
sang
me
from
the
cottonwood
too
young
to
feel
that
i
was
young
too
glad
to
guess
if
life
were
good
and
while
i
hark
before
my
door
adown
the
dusty
concord
road
the
blue
miami
flows
once
more
as
by
the
cottonwood
it
flowed
and
on
the
bank
that
rises
steep
and
pours

could

pordenone
i
hard
by
the
church
of
saint
stephen
in
sole
and
beautiful
venice
under
the
colonnade
of
the
augustinian
convent
every
day
as
i
passed
i
paused
to
look
at
the
frescos
painted
upon
the
ancient
walls
of
the
court
of
the
convent
by
a
great
master
of
old
who
wore
his
sword
and
his
dagger
while
he
wrought
the
figures
of
patriarchs
martyrs
and
virgins
into
the
sacred
and
famous
scenes
of
scriptural
story
ii
long
ago
the
monks
from
their
snug
were
driven
wistful
and
fat
and
slow
looking
backward
i
fancied
them
going
out
through
the
sculptured
doorway
and
down
the
ponte
cowled
and
sandalled
and
beaded
a
plump
and
pensive
procession
and
in
my
day
their
cells
were
barracks
for
austrian
soldiers
who
in
their
turn
have
followed
the
augustinian
friars
as
to
the
frescos
little
remained
of
work
once
so
perfect
summer
and
winter
weather
of
some
three
cycles
had
wasted
plaster
had
fallen
and
left
unsightly
blotches
of
ruin
wanton
and
stupid
neglect
had
done
its
worst
to
the
pictures
yet
to
the
sympathetic
and
reverent
eye
was
apparent
where
the
careless
glance
but
found
in
expanses
of
plaster
touches
of
incoherent
color
and
lines
interrupted
somewhat
still
of
the
life
of
surpassing
splendor
and
glory
filling
the
frescos
once
and
here
and
there
was
a
figure
standing
apart
and
out
from
the
common
decay
and
confusion
flushed
with
immortal
youth
and
ineffaceable
beauty
such
as
that
figure
of
eve
in
pathetic
expulsion
from
eden
taking
the
tourist
remembers
the
wrath
of
heaven
al
fresco
as
is
her
custom
in
thousands
of
acres
of
canvas
iii
i
could
make
out
the
biblical
subjects
when
i
had
patience
enough
the
temptation
of
course
and
expulsion
cain
killing
abel
his
brother
the
merest
fragment
of
murder
noah

of
the

only

by
the
hovering
angel
martyrdom
of

a
part
of
the
figure
of
stephen
and
the
conversion
of
paul
the
greaves
on
the
leg
of
a
soldier
held
across
the
back
of
a
prostrate
horse
by
the
stirrup
but
when
i
looked
at
the
face
of
that
tearful
and
beauteous
figure
eve
in
the
fresco
there
and
in
venice
of
old
violante
as
i
must
fain
believe
the
lovely
daughter
of
palma
who
was
her
father
saint
barbara
and
was
the
bella
of
titian
such
a
meaning
and
life
shone
forth
from
its
animate
presence
as
could
restore
those
vague
and
ineffectual
pictures
with
their
pristine
colors
and
fill
them
with
light
and
with
movement
nay
sometimes
it
could
blind
me
to
all
the
present
about
me
till
i
beheld
no
more
the
austrian
soldiers
where
they
stood
on
guard
beside
one
door
of
the
convent
nor
the
sentinel
beggars
that
watched
the
approach
to
the
other
neither
the
bigolanti
the
friulan
maidens
drawing
the
water
with
clatter
and
splashing
and
laughter
and
gossip
out
of
the
carven
well
in
the
midst
of
the
court
of
the
convent
no
not
even
the
one
with
the
mole
on
her
cheek
and
the
sidelong
look
as
she
ambled
forth
with
her
buckets
of
bronze
at
her
shoulder
swinging
upon
the
yoke
to
and
fro
and
all
in
an
instant
was
changed
and
once
more
the
cloister
was
peopled
by
the
serene
monks
of
old
and
against
walls
of
the
cloisters
high
on
his
scaffolding
raised
pordenone
wrought
at
his
frescos
armed
with
dagger
and
sword
as
the
legend
tells
against
titian
who
was
his
rival
in
art
and
in
love
iv
it
seemed
to
be
summer
in
the
forenoon
of
the
day
and
the
master
diligent
pencil
laid
its
last
light
touches
on
eve
driven
forth
out
of
eden
otherwise
violante
and
while
his
pupils
about
him
wrought
and
chattered
in
silence
ran
the
thought
of
the
painter
she
and
forever
she
is
it
come
to
be
my
perdition
shall
i
then
never
more
make
the
face
of
a
beautiful
woman
but
it
must
take
her
divine
accursèd
beauty
upon
it
and
when
i
finish
my
work
stand
forth
her
visible
presence
ah
i
could
take
this
sword
and
strike
it
into
her
bosom
though
i
believe
my
own
heart
blood
would
stream
from
the
painting
so
much
i
love
her
yes
that
look
is
marvellous
like
you
wandering
tender
such
as
i
give
my
salvation
to
win
you
once
to
bend
upon
me
but
i
knew
myself
better
than
make
you
lest
i
should
play
the
fool
about
you
here
before
people
helpless
to
turn
away
from
your
violet
eyes
violante
that
have
turned
all
my
life
to
a
vision
of
madness
the
painter
here
unto
speech
betraying
the
thoughts
he
had
silently
pondered
visions
visions
my
son
said
a
gray
old
friar
who
listened
seated
there
in
the
sun
with
his
eye
on
the
work
of
the
painter
fishily
fixed
while
the
master
blasphemed
behind
his
mustaches
much
have
i
envied
your
art
who
vouchsafeth
to
those
who
adore
her
visions
of
heavenly
splendor
denied
to
fastings
and
vigils
i
have
spent
days
and
nights
of
faint
and
painful
devotion
scourged
myself
almost
to
death
without
one
glimpse
of
the
glory
which
your
touch
has
revealed
in
the
face
of
that
heavenly
maiden
pleasure
me
to
repeat
what
it
was
you
were
saying
of
visions
fain
would
i
know
how
they
come
to
you
though
never
see
them
and
in
my
thickness
of
hearing
i
fear
some
words
have
escaped
me
then
while
the
painter
glared
on
the
lifted
face
of
the
friar
baleful
breathless
bewildered
fiercer
than
noon
in
the
round
the
circle
of
pupils
there
ran
a
tittering
murmur
from
the
lips
to
the
ears
of
those
nameless
beppis
and
gigis
buzzed
the
stinging
whisper
let
hear
pordenone
confession
well
they
knew
the
master
luckless
love
and
whose
portrait
he
had
unconsciously
painted
there
and
guessed
that
his
visions
scarcely
were
those
conceived
by
the
friar
who
constantly
blundered
round
the
painter
at
work
mistaking
every
subject
noah
drunken
debauch
for
the
stoning
of
stephen
the
martyr
and
the
conversion
of
paul
for
the
flight
into
egypt
forever
putting
his
hand
to
his
ear
and
shouting
speak
louder
i
pray
you
so
they
waited
now
in
silent
amused
expectation
till
pordenone
angry
scorn
should
gather
to
bursting
long
the
painter
gazed
in
furious
silence
then
slowly
uttered
a
kind
of
moan
and
turned
again
to
his
labor
tears
gathered
into
his
eyes
of
mortification
and
pathos
and
when
the
dull
old
monk
who
forgot
while
he
waited
the
answer
visions
and
painter
and
all
had
maundered
away
in
his
error
pordenone
half
envied
the
imbecile
peace
of
his
bosom
for
in
my
own
he
mused
is
such
a
combat
of
devils
that
i
believe
torpid
age
or
stupid
youth
would
be
better
than
this
manhood
of
mine
that
has
climbed
aloft
to
discover
heights
which
i
never
can
reach
and
bright
on
the
pinnacle
standing
in
the
unfading
light
my
rival
crowned
victor
above
me
if
i
could
hint
what
i
feel
what
forever
escapes
from
my
pencil
all
should
know
my
will
was
not
less
than
my
failure
nor
should
any
one
dare
remember
me
merely
in
pity
all
should
read
my
sorrows
and
do
my
discomfiture
homage
saying
meanly
at
any
time
this
painter
meant
or
endeavored
his
was
the
anguish
of
one
who
falls
short
of
the
highest
achievement
conscious
of
doing
his
utmost
and
knowing
how
vast
his
defeat
is
life
if
he
would
might
have
had
some
second
guerdon
to
give
him
but
he
would
only
the
first
and
behold
let
us
honor
grief
such
as
his
must
have
been
no
other
sorrow
can
match
it
there
are
certainly
some
things
here
that
are
nobly
imagined
look
here
is
masterly
power
in
this
play
of
light
and
these
shadows
boldly
are
massed
and
what
color
one
can
well
understand
buonarotti
saying
the
sight
of
his
curtius
was
worth
the
whole
journey
from
florence
here
is
a
man
at
least
never
less
than
his
work
you
can
feel
it
as
you
can
feel
in
titian
the
painter
inferior
spirit
he
and
this
pordenone
you
know
were
rivals
and
titian
knew
how
to
paint
to
the
popular
humor
and
spared
not
foul
means
or
fair
his
way
with
rivals
to
crush
pordenone
who
with
an
equal
chance
alas
if
the
whole
world
should
tell
me
i
was
his
equal
in
art
and
the
lie
could
save
me
from
torment
so
must
i
be
lost
for
my
soul
could
never
believe
it
nay
let
my
envy
snarl
as
fierce
as
it
will
at
his
glory
still
when
i
look
on
his
work
my
soul
makes
obeisance
within
me
humbling
itself
before
the
touch
that
shall
never
be
equalled
he
who
sleeps
in
continual
noise
is
wakened
by
silence
and
pordenone
was
roused
from
these
thoughts
anon
by
the
sudden
hush
that
had
fallen
upon
the
garrulous
group
of
his
pupils
and
ere
he
turned
with
instinctive
looks
of
inquiry
he
was
already
warned
with
a
shock
at
the
heart
of
a
presence
long
attended
not
feared
and
he
laid
one
hand
on
his
seizing
the
sheath
with
the
other
hand
that
the
pallet
had
dropped
from
then
he
fronted
titian
who
stood
with
his
arms
lightly
folded
and
with
a
curious
smile
half
of
sarcasm
half
of
compassion
bent
on
th
embattled
painter
cried
your
slave
messere
antonio
what
good
friend
has
played
this
bitter
jest
with
your
humor
as
i
beheld
you
just
now
with
your
pencil
and
palette
i
was
half
awed
by
your
might
but
these
sorry
trappings
of
bravo
make
me
believe
you
less
fit
to
be
the
rival
of
titian
here
in
the
peaceful
calm
of
our
city
of
venice
than
to
take
service
under
some
spanish
lordling
at
naples
needy
in
blades
for
work
that
can
not
wait
for
the
poison
pordenone
flushed
with
anger
and
shame
to
be
taken
at
an
unguarded
point
but
he
answered
with
scornful
defiance
oh
you
are
come
i
see
with
the
favorite
weapon
of
titian
and
you
would
make
a
battle
of
words
if
you
care
for
my
counsel
listen
to
me
i
say
you
are
skilfuller
far
in
my
absence
and
your
tongue
can
inflict
a
keener
and
deadlier
mischief
when
it
is
dipped
in
poisonous
lies
and
wielded
in
secret
nay
then
titian
responded
methinks
that
our
friend
aretino
makes
a
much
better
effect
than
either
of
us
in
that
but
since
messer
robusti
has
measured
our
wit
for
his
portrait
even
has
grown
shyer
of
using
his
tongue
than
he
once
was
have
you
not
heard
the
tale
tintoretto
was
told
aretino
meant
to
make
him
the
subject
of
one
of
his
merry
effusions
and
with
his
naked
dirk
he
went
carefully
over
his
person
promising
if
the
poet
made
free
with
him
in
his
verses
he
would
immortalize
my
satirical
friend
with
that
pencil
doubtless
the
tale
is
not
true
aretino
says
nothing
about
it
always
speaks
in
fact
with
the
highest
respect
of
robusti
true
or
not
is
well
found
then
looking
around
on
the
frescos
good
very
good
indeed
your
breadth
and
richness
and
softness
no
man
living
surpasses
those
heads
are
truly
majestic
yes
buonarotti
was
right
when
he
said
that
to
look
at
your
curtius
richly
repaid
him
the
trouble
and
cost
of
a
journey
from
florence
surely
the
world
shall
know
you
the
first
of
painters
in
fresco
well
you
will
not
strike
me
unarmed
this
was
hardly
expected
by
the
good
people
that
taught
you
to
think
our
rivalry
let
us
be
friends
pordenone
be
patron
and
patronized
rather
nay
if
you
spoke
your
whole
mind
out
be
assassin
and
victim
could
the
life
beat
again
in
the
broken
heart
of
giorgione
he
might
tell
us
i
think
something
pleasant
of
friendship
with
titian
suddenly
over
the
shoulder
of
titian
peered
an
ironical
visage
smiling
malignly
intent
the
leer
of
the
scurrilous
poet
you
know
all
the
world
knows
who
dug
the
grave
of
giorgione
titian
and
he
were
no
friends
our
lady
of
sorrows
forgive
but
for
all
hurt
that
titian
did
him
he
might
have
been
living
greater
than
any
living
and
lord
of
renown
and
such
glory
as
would
have
left
you
both
dull
as
yon
withered
moon
in
the
sunshine
loud
laughed
the
listening
group
at
the
insolent
gibe
of
the
poet
stirring
the
gall
to
its
depths
in
the
bitter
soul
of
their
master
who
with
his
tremulous
fingers
tapped
the
hilt
of
his
poniard
answering
naught
as
yet
anon
the
glance
of
the
ribald
carelessly
ranging
from
pordenone
face
to
the
picture
dwelt
with
an
absent
light
on
its
marvellous
beauty
and
kindled
into
a
slow
recognition
with
ha
violante
then
erring
wilfully
as
to
the
subject
he
cackled
his
filthy
derision
what
have
we
here
more
magdalens
yet
of
the
painter
acquaintance
ah
the
words
had
scarce
left
his
lips
when
the
painter
rushed
upon
him
and
clutching
his
throat
thrust
him
backward
and
held
him
over
the
scaffolding
edge
in
air
and
straightway
had
flung
him
crashing
down
on
the
pave
of
the
cloister
below
but
for
titian
who
around
painter
and
poet
alike
wound
his
strong
arms
and
stayed
them
solely
until
the
bewildered
pupils
could
come
to
the
rescue
then
as
the
foes
relaxed
that
embrace
of
frenzy
and
murder
white
one
with
rage
and
the
other
with
terror
and
either
with
hatred
grimly
the
great
master
smiled
you
were
much
nearer
paradise
piero
than
you
have
been
for
some
time
be
ruled
now
by
me
and
get
homeward
fast
as
you
may
and
be
thankful
and
then
as
the
poet
looking
neither
to
right
nor
to
left
amid
the
smiles
of
the
pupils
tottered
along
the
platform
and
trembling
descended
the
ladder
down
to
the
cloister
pave
and
still
without
upward
or
backward
glance
disappeared
beneath
the
outer
door
of
the
convent
titian
turned
again
to
the
painter
farewell
pordenone
learn
more
fairly
to
know
me
i
envy
you
not
and
no
rival
now
or
at
any
time
have
i
held
you
or
ever
shall
hold
you
prosper
and
triumph
still
for
all
me
you
shall
but
do
me
honor
seeing
that
i
too
serve
the
art
that
your
triumphs
illustrate
i
for
my
part
find
life
too
short
for
work
and
for
pleasure
if
it
should
touch
a
century
bound
i
should
think
it
too
precious
even
to
spare
a
moment
for
rage
at
another
good
fortune
do
not
be
fooled
by
the
purblind
flatterers
who
would
persuade
you
either
of
us
shall
have
greater
fame
through
the
fall
of
the
other
we
can
thrive
only
in
common
the
tardily
blossoming
cycles
flowering
at
last
in
this
glorious
age
of
our
art
had
not
waited
folded
calyxes
still
for
pordenone
or
titian
think
you
if
we
had
not
been
our
pictures
had
never
been
painted
others
had
done
them
or
better
the
same
we
are
only
pencils
god
paints
with
and
think
you
that
he
had
wanted
for
pencils
but
for
our
being
at
hand
and
yet
for
some
virtue
creative
dwells
and
divinely
exists
in
the
being
of
every
creature
so
that
the
thing
done
through
him
is
dear
as
if
he
had
done
it
if
i
should
see
your
power
a
tint
of
this
great
efflorescence
fading
methinks
i
should
feel
myself
beginning
to
wither
they
have
abused
your
hate
who
told
you
that
titian
was
jealous
once
in
my
youth
that
is
passed
i
too
had
my
hates
and
my
envies
how
it
used
to
gall
me
that
power
and
depth
of
giorgione
i
could
have
turned
my
knife
in
his
heart
when
i
looked
at
his
portraits
ah
we
learn
somewhat
still
as
the
years
go
now
when
i
see
you
doing
this
good
work
here
i
am
glad
in
my
soul
of
its
beauty
art
is
not
ours
o
friend
but
if
we
are
not
hers
we
are
nothing
look
at
the
face
you
painted
last
year
or
yesterday
even
far
so
far
it
seems
from
you
so
utterly
finally
parted
nothing
is
stranger
to
you
than
this
child
of
your
soul
and
you
wonder
i
indeed
then
do
it
no
thrill
of
the
rapture
of
doing
stirs
in
your
breast
at
the
sight
nay
then
not
even
the
beauty
which
we
had
seemed
to
create
is
our
own
the
frame
universal
is
as
much
ours
and
shall
i
hate
you
because
you
are
doing
that
which
when
done
you
can
not
feel
yours
more
than
i
mine
can
feel
it
it
shall
belong
hereafter
to
all
who
perceive
and
enjoy
it
rather
than
him
who
made
it
he
least
of
all
shall
enjoy
it
they
of
the
church
conjure
us
to
look
on
death
and
be
humble
i
say
look
upon
life
and
keep
your
pride
if
you
can
then
see
how
achievement
is
only
confusion
see
how
possession
always
cheapens
the
thing
that
was
precious
to
our
endeavor
how
losses
and
gains
are
equally
losses
how
in
ourselves
we
are
nothing
and
how
we
are
anything
only
as
indifferent
parts
of
the
whole
that
still
on
our
ceasing
whole
remains
as
before
no
less
without
us
than
with
us
were
it
not
for
the
delight
of
doing
the
wonderful
instant
ere
the
thing
done
is
done
and
dead
life
scarce
were
worth
living
ah
but
that
makes
life
divine
we
are
gods
for
that
instant
immortal
mortal
for
evermore
with
a
few
days
rumor
or
ages

does
it
matter

too
have
our
share

and
drinking

common
portion
and
pleasure
come
pordenone
with
me
i
would
fain
have
you
see
my
assumption
while
it
is
still
unfinished
and
stay
with
me
for
the
evening
you
shall
send
home
for
your
lute
and
i
ask
sansovino
to
supper
after
what
happened
just
now
i
scarcely
could
ask
aretino
though
for
the
matter
of
that
the
dog
is
not
one
to
bear
malice
will
you
not
come
i
listen
with
titian
and
wait
for
the
answer
but
whatever
the
answer
that
comes
to
titian
i
hear
none
nay
while
i
linger
all
those
presences
fade
into
nothing
in
the
dead
air
of
the
past
and
the
old
augustinian
convent
lapses
to
picturesque
profanation
again
as
a
barrack
lapses
and
changes
once
more
and
this
time
vanishes
wholly
leaving
me
at
the
end
with
the
broken
shadowy
legend
broken
and
shadowy
still
as
in
the
beginning
i
linger
teased
with
its
vague
unfathomed
suggestion
and
wonder
as
at
first
i
wondered
what
happened
about
violante
and
am
but
ill
content
with
those
metaphysical
phrases
touching
the
strictly
impersonal
nature
of
personal
effort
wherewithal
titian
had
fain
avoided
the
matter
at
issue
