introduction
i
have
been
asked
to
write
why
i
wrote
this
poem
of
reynard
the
fox
as
a
man
grows
older
life
becomes
more
interesting
but
less
easy
to
know
for
late
in
life
even
the
strongest
yields
to
the
habit
of
his
compartment
when
he
can
not
range
through
all
society
from
the
court
to
the
gutter
a
man
must
go
where
all
society
meets
as
at
the
pilgrimage
the
festival
or
the
game
here
in
england
the
game
is
both
a
festival
and
an
occasion
of
pilgrimage
a
man
wanting
to
set
down
a
picture
of
the
society
of
england
will
find
his
models
at
the
games
what
are
the
english
games
the
man
game
is
association
football
the
woman
game
perhaps
hockey
or
lacrosse
golf
i
regard
more
as
a
symptom
of
a
happy
marriage
than
a
game
cricket
which
was
once
widely
popular
among
both
sexes
has
lost
its
hold
except
among
the
young
the
worst
of
all
these
games
is
that
few
can
play
them
at
a
time
but
in
the
english
country
during
the
autumn
winter
and
early
spring
of
each
year
the
main
sport
is
fox
hunting
which
is
not
like
cricket
or
football
a
game
for
a
few
and
a
spectacle
for
many
but
something
in
which
all
who
come
may
take
a
part
whether
rich
or
poor
mounted
or
on
foot
it
is
a
sport
loved
and
followed
by
both
sexes
all
ages
and
all
classes
at
a
fox
hunt
and
nowhere
else
in
england
except
perhaps
at
a
funeral
can
you
see
the
whole
of
the
land
society
brought
together
focussed
for
the
observer
as
the
canterbury
pilgrims
were
for
chaucer
this
fact
made
the
subject
attractive
the
fox
hunt
gave
an
opportunity
for
a
picture
or
pictures
of
the
members
of
an
english
community
then
to
all
englishmen
who
have
lived
in
a
hunting
country
hunting
is
in
the
blood
and
the
mind
is
full
of
it
it
is
the
most
beautiful
and
the
most
stirring
sight
to
be
seen
in
england
in
the
ports
as
at
falmouth
there
are
ships
under
sail
under
way
coming
or
going
beautiful
unspeakably
in
the
country
especially
on
the
great
fields
on
the
lower
slopes
of
the
downland
the
teams
of
the
ploughmen
may
be
seen
bowing
forward
on
a
and
this
sight
can
never
fail
to
move
one
by
its
majesty
of
beauty
but
in
neither
of
these
sights
of
beauty
is
there
the
bright
colour
and
swift
excitement
of
the
hunt
nor
the
thrill
of
the
horn
and
the
cry
of
the
hounds
ringing
into
the
elements
of
the
soul
something
in
the
hunt
wakens
memories
hidden
in
the
marrow
racial
memories
of
when
one
hunted
for
the
tribe
animal
memories
perhaps
of
when
one
hunted
with
the
pack
or
was
hunted
hunting
has
always
been
popular
here
in
england
in
ancient
times
it
was
necessary
wolves
wild
boar
foxes
and
deer
had
to
be
kept
down
to
hunt
was
then
the
social
duty
of
the
mounted
man
when
he
was
not
engaged
in
war
it
was
also
the
opportunity
of
all
other
members
of
the
community
to
have
a
good
time
in
the
open
with
a
feast
or
a
new
fur
at
the
end
to
crown
the
pleasure
since
arms
of
precision
were
made
hunting
on
horseback
with
hounds
has
perhaps
been
unnecessary
everywhere
but
it
is
not
easy
to
end
a
pleasure
rooted
in
the
instincts
of
men
hunting
has
continued
and
probably
will
continue
in
this
country
and
in
ireland
it
is
rapidly
becoming
a
national
sport
in
the
united
states
some
have
written
that
hunting
is
the
sport
of
the
wealthy
man
some
wealthy
men
hunt
no
doubt
but
they
are
not
the
backbone
of
the
sport
so
much
as
those
who
love
and
use
horses
parts
of
this
country
of
ireland
and
of
the
united
states
are
more
than
ordinarily
good
pasture
fitted
for
the
breeding
of
horses
beyond
most
other
places
in
the
world
hardly
anywhere
else
is
the
climate
so
equable
the
soil
so
right
for
the
feet
of
colts
and
the
grass
so
good
where
these
conditions
exist
men
will
breed
horses
and
use
them
men
who
breed
good
horses
will
ride
jump
and
test
them
and
will
invent
means
of
riding
jumping
and
testing
them
the
steeplechase
the
circus
the
contests
at
fairs
and
shows
the
meeting
and
they
will
preserve
if
possible
any
otherwise
dying
sport
which
offers
such
means
i
have
mentioned
several
reasons
why
fox
hunting
should
be
popular
that
it
is
a
social
business
at
which
the
whole
community
may
and
does
attend
in
vast
numbers
in
a
pleasant
mood
of
goodwill
good
humour
and
equality
and
during
which
all
may
go
anywhere
into
ground
otherwise
shut
to
them
that
it
is
done
in
the
winter
at
a
season
when
other
social
gatherings
are
difficult
and
in
country
districts
where
no
buildings
except
the
churches
could
contain
the
numbers
assembled
that
it
is
most
beautiful
to
watch
so
beautiful
that
perhaps
very
few
of
the
acts
of
men
can
be
so
lovely
to
watch
nor
so
exhilarating
the
only
thing
to
be
compared
with
it
in
this
country
is
the
sword
dance
the
old
heroical
dancing
of
the
young
men
still
practised
in
all
its
splendour
of
wild
beauty
in
some
country
places
that
we
are
a
people
who
have
loved
horses
as
we
have
loved
the
sea
and
have
made
in
the
course
of
generations
a
breed
of
horse
second
to
none
in
the
world
for
beauty
and
speed
but
besides
all
these
reasons
there
is
another
that
brings
many
out
hunting
this
is
the
delight
in
hunting
in
the
working
of
hounds
by
themselves
or
with
the
huntsmen
to
find
and
kill
their
fox
though
many
men
and
women
hunt
in
order
to
ride
many
still
ride
in
order
to
hunt
perhaps
this
delight
in
hunting
was
more
general
in
the
century
when
hounds
were
much
slower
than
at
present
then
the
hunt
was
indeed
a
test
of
hounds
and
huntsman
the
fox
was
not
run
down
but
hunted
down
the
great
run
then
was
that
in
which
hounds
and
huntsman
kept
to
their
fox
the
great
run
now
is
perhaps
that
in
which
some
few
riders
keep
with
the
hounds
the
ideal
run
of
might
have
been
described
thus
being
in
the
current
of
writing
i
can
not
but
acquaint
your
lorp
of
ye
great
hunt
there
was
this
tuesday
last
there
was
a
a
week
sure
so
great
a
day
has
not
been
seen
here
since
the
day
your
lorp
father
broke
his
collar
bone
at
ye
park
wall
as
milton
says
well
have
we
speeded
and
hill
and
dale
forest
and
field
and
flood
as
far
as
indus
east
euphrates
west
we
had
but
dismle
weather
of
it
and
so
cold
as
made
sir
harry
observe
that
it
was
an
ill
wind
blew
any
good
we
met
at
ye
tailings
i
had
out
my
brown
horse
there
was
present
sir
anthony
smoaker
jarvis
of
copse
stile
william
travis
john
hawbuck
your
lorp
friend
dick
fancowe
and
two
of
ye
red
coats
from
ye
barracks
ye
fair
sex
was
dismayed
it
was
said
by
ye
rudeness
of
ye
elements
they
did
not
venture
it
on
coming
to
draw
tailings
wood
glider
spoke
to
it
and
tom
viewed
him
away
for
the
valley
being
the
old
dog
fox
with
the
white
mask
that
beat
us
at
fubb
field
the
day
your
lorp
road
bluebell
now
spoke
the
chearful
horn
and
tuneful
hounds
echoed
and
red
coats
gallopped
stirring
scean
rude
health
and
manly
wit
together
strive
we
went
with
the
extream
of
violence
from
tailings
wood
to
ye
small
coppice
at
nap
hill
where
a
fellow
put
him
from
his
point
which
gave
occasion
to
sir
anthony
to
correct
him
ye
little
magpie
hound
made
it
out
in
ye
bog
at
ye
back
of
ye
coppice
when
again
hounds
went
at
head
through
long
stone
pastures
as
far
as
tainton
here
we
was
delayed
in
ye
dear
park
the
effluvia
of
ye
dear
being
extream
strong
and
doubtless
puzzling
to
the
noses
of
ye
hounds
and
here
i
can
not
but
remark
the
skill
with
which
ye
hounds
worked
it
out
till
they
had
hit
it
off
a
sight
as
jarvis
remarked
to
me
worthy
of
the
admiration
of
an
antient
philosopher
and
of
the
eloquence
of
a
most
elegant
wit
or
poet
leaving
ye
dear
park
he
made
for
norton
cross
which
he
left
on
his
left
hand
as
though
deciding
for
ye
hill
crossing
ye
hill
in
spite
of
ye
sheep
he
was
a
little
staggered
by
his
being
run
by
one
of
ye
shepherd
doggs
a
part
of
creation
that
should
not
be
tolerated
except
in
ye
vision
of
ye
poet
as
in
a
pastoral
or
so
here
joe
phillips
our
huntsman
made
unavailing
casts
but
by
lifting
to
the
vineyard
recovered
him
when
hounds
run
him
to
cow
crookham
on
your
lorp
aston
estate
by
this
time
your
lorp
will
understand
our
distress
dick
fancowe
was
in
ye
brook
at
norton
jarvis
grey
horse
had
cast
a
shoe
and
one
of
ye
red
coats
had
broak
his
liver
in
falling
at
a
fence
for
a
time
we
went
about
to
recover
him
now
with
attentive
nose
the
restless
hound
endeavours
on
the
scent
now
here
now
there
scorning
adulterat
scents
of
lesser
prey
now
gloomy
care
invades
the
huntsman
face
and
sportsmen
jovial
erst
on
weary
steeds
sit
pensive
here
might
well
be
seen
the
advantages
of
a
judicious
breeding
in
hounds
that
neglects
not
the
intellectual
part
but
aims
rather
at
a
complete
animal
than
alone
at
sinews
and
corporeal
structure
that
blood
of
the
old
berkshire
glorious
which
your
lorp
father
was
wont
to
observe
was
what
he
most
stood
by
next
to
our
constitution
and
the
protestant
succession
here
stood
us
in
good
stead
for
it
was
to
glorious
ye
ninth
as
well
as
to
growler
and
glider
all
of
ye
same
royal
strain
that
we
was
indebted
to
ye
happy
conclusion
they
pushed
him
out
of
ye
stubbings
at
cow
crookham
where
it
seems
he
had
taken
refuge
in
the
hollow
of
a
decayed
tree
we
him
thence
upon
ye
grass
to
shepherd
hey
here
he
began
to
run
short
being
not
a
little
apprehensive
lest
his
foes
should
triumph
and
snatch
from
him
that
life
which
he
had
so
long
nefariously
pampered
on
courtly
cock
with
all
his
household
train
of
hens
obsequious
by
the
hen
wife
mourned
the
sun
coming
out
from
among
ye
clouds
where
he
had
been
too
long
hid
made
as
was
elegantly
pretended
by
sir
anthony
a
brightness
animating
indeed
to
us
who
carried
the
sword
of
justice
but
to
the
criminal
of
our
pursuit
infinitely
distressing
then
had
your
lorp
seen
the
gay
ardor
of
the
pack
as
they
came
to
the
view
which
they
did
about
stonepits
your
lorp
would
have
said
with
the
late
elegant
poet
now
the
glittering
grass
the
sinewy
hound
shakes
from
his
feet
the
dew
and
makes
ye
woods
resound
to
be
brief
we
killed
in
the
back
yard
of
ye
rummer
and
glass
after
two
and
three
quarters
hours
of
a
hunt
such
as
all
are
agreed
is
not
lightly
to
be
parallelled
there
was
present
at
ye
death
beside
joe
phillips
and
tom
sir
smoaker
wm
travis
and
myself
all
so
extream
distresst
men
and
beasts
that
it
was
observed
it
was
a
marvel
ye
horses
were
not
dead
such
an
hunt
it
was
agreed
should
be
celebrated
by
an
annual
dinner
at
which
the
toast
of
ye
chase
might
be
rendered
more
than
ordinary
ye
hunt
was
upwards
of
fifteen
miles
in
length
and
hath
been
the
subject
of
a
song
by
a
member
of
ye
hunt
which
as
it
would
take
long
to
transcribe
i
forbear
hoping
that
we
may
sing
it
to
your
lorp
before
as
ye
poet
says
ye
vixen
hath
laid
up
her
cubs
in
snuggest
cave
secure
when
balmy
spring
wakens
ye
meadows
but
to
pass
now
from
celestial
pleasures
to
worldly
cares
i
have
to
acquaint
your
lorp
that
your
lorp
sister
son
parracombe
hath
been
killed
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
after
dinner
with
some
gentlemen
his
particular
friends
an
affliction
indeed
great
humanly
regarded
were
it
not
also
considered
how
much
happier
his
lot
must
be
than
in
this
vale
of
tears
etc
ye
young
hounds
thrive
apace
and
it
is
thought
the
forward
season
will
be
very
favourable
for
their
future
prey
i
am
your
lorp
most
obedient
charles
cothill
perhaps
the
ideal
run
of
the
present
time
would
be
described
as
follows
a
large
field
attended
the
templecombe
on
tuesday
last
at
the
popular
meet
at
heydigates
will
mynors
late
of
the
parratts
carried
the
horn
in
place
of
tom
carling
now
with
fletchers
a
little
time
was
spent
in
running
through
the
shrubberies
in
the
garden
at
heydigates
and
then
the
word
was
given
for
the
cantlows
will
had
no
sooner
put
hounds
into
this
famous
cover
than
the
dog
pack
proclaimed
the
joyous
news
the
fox
a
traveller
was
at
once
viewed
away
for
the
three
oaks
across
the
rather
heavy
going
of
the
pasture
land
coming
to
the
knock
brook
he
swam
it
near
parson
pleasure
going
at
a
pace
that
let
the
knowing
ones
know
that
they
were
in
for
something
out
of
the
common
keeping
snib
farm
on
his
right
he
ran
dead
straight
for
gallow
wood
where
some
woodmen
with
their
teams
disturbed
him
swinging
to
his
left
he
went
up
the
hill
through
bloody
lane
as
though
towards
dinsmore
but
was
again
deflected
by
woodmen
turning
down
the
hill
he
ran
for
the
valley
passing
enderton
schoolhouse
the
scholars
of
which
were
much
cheered
by
the
near
prospect
of
the
hunt
it
was
now
evident
that
he
was
going
for
the
downs
some
of
the
less
daring
began
to
express
the
hope
that
he
might
be
headed
scent
from
the
first
was
burning
and
the
pace
a
cracker
after
leaving
enderton
he
made
straight
for
the
danesway
past
snub
titch
and
the
curlews
the
green
meadows
of
the
pasture
being
sprinkled
for
miles
with
the
relics
of
the
field
he
crossed
the
roman
road
at
orm
oak
and
at
once
entered
the
danesway
going
at
a
pace
which
all
thought
could
not
last
at
the
summit
of
the
danesway
known
as
the
gallows
point
hounds
were
brought
to
their
noses
owing
to
the
crossing
of
the
line
by
sheep
a
man
working
nearby
was
able
to
give
the
line
and
will
lifting
beyond
the
lynchets
at
once
hit
him
off
and
the
hounds
resumed
their
rush
from
this
point
they
went
almost
exactly
straight
from
the
head
of
the
danesway
to
the
fir
copse
by
arthur
table
all
this
part
of
the
run
being
across
a
rolling
grass
land
was
at
top
speed
such
as
no
horse
could
live
with
at
arthur
table
he
was
put
from
his
earth
by
shooters
who
were
netting
the
warren
as
he
could
not
get
through
them
nor
across
the
highway
then
busy
with
traffic
he
doubled
down
across
the
starvings
where
will
the
only
man
up
at
this
point
although
now
three
hundred
yards
behind
hounds
caught
sight
of
him
on
the
opposite
slope
romping
away
from

as
though
he
would
never
grow
old
on
coming
to
the
level
past
spinney
end
some
of
those
who
had
been
left
at
the
lynchets
were
able
to
rejoin
but
were
soon
again
cast
out
by
the
extreme
violence
of
the
going
which
continued
back
across
the
downs
on
a
line
obliquely
parallel
with
his
former
track
though
a
mile
further
to
the
south
it
was
supposed
that
he
was
going
for
the
main
earth
in
bloody
acre
copse
some
workers
in
the
strip
at
the
edge
of
the
copse
headed
him
from
this
point
he
swung
past
staves
acre
and
so
down
to
the
valley
by
the
shelving
ground
near
monk
charwell
here
for
some
unaccountable
reason
the
scent
which
had
been
breast
high
became
catchy
and
hounds
lost
their
fox
in
the
osier
cars
at
charwell
springs
later
in
the
afternoon
while
jogging
home
a
second
fox
was
chopped
in
parsloe
cover
at
prince
charwell
hounds
then
went
home
the
run
from
the
cantlows
was
not
remarkable
for
any
quality
of
hunting
but
extremely
so
for
pace
and
length
the
distance
run
from
cantlows
wood
to
the
osiers
can
not
have
been
less
than
thirteen
miles
most
of
it
indeed
on
the
best
going
in
the
world
but
at
a
racing
pace
with
nothing
that
can
be
called
a
check
the
whole
way
some
wished
that
the
hounds
might
have
been
rewarded
and
others
that
will
mynors
might
have
crowned
his
opening
gallop
with
a
kill
but
the
general
feeling
was
one
of
satisfaction
that
so
game
a
fox
escaped
my
own
interest
in
fox
hunting
began
at
a
very
early
age
i
was
born
in
a
good
hunting
country
partly
woodland
partly
pasture
my
home
during
my
first
seven
years
was
within
half
a
mile
of
the
kennels
i
saw
hounds
on
most
days
of
my
life
hounds
and
hunting
filled
my
imagination
i
saw
many
meets
each
as
romantic
as
a
circus
the
huntsman
and
seemed
then
to
be
the
greatest
men
in
the
world
and
those
mild
slaves
the
hounds
the
loveliest
animals
often
as
a
little
child
i
saw
and
heard
hounds
hunting
in
and
near
a
covert
within
sight
of
my
old
home
once
when
i
was
perhaps
five
years
old
the
fox
was
hunted
into
our
garden
and
those
glorious
beings
in
scarlet
as
well
as
the
hounds
were
all
about
my
lairs
like
visitants
from
paradise
the
fox
on
this
occasion
went
through
a
woodshed
and
escaped
later
in
my
childhood
though
i
lived
less
near
to
the
kennels
i
was
still
within
a
mile
of
them
and
saw
hounds
frequently
at
all
seasons
in
that
hunting
country
hunting
was
one
of
the
interests
of
life
everybody
knew
about
it
loved
followed
watched
and
discussed
it
i
went
to
many
meets
and
followed
many
hunts
on
foot
each
of
these
occasions
is
now
distinct
in
my
mind
with
the
colour
and
intensity
of
beauty
i
saw
many
foxes
starting
off
upon
their
runs
with
the
hounds
close
behind
them
it
was
then
that
i
learned
to
admire
the
ease
and
beauty
of
the
speed
of
the
fresh
fox
that
leisurely
hurry
which
romps
away
from
the
hardest
trained
and
swiftest
fox
hounds
without
a
visible
effort
as
though
the
hounds
were
weighted
with
lead
is
the
most
lovely
motion
i
have
seen
in
an
animal
no
fox
was
the
original
of
my
reynard
but
as
i
was
much
in
the
woods
as
a
boy
i
saw
foxes
fairly
often
considering
that
they
are
animals
their
grace
beauty
cleverness
and
secrecy
always
thrilled
me
then
that
kind
of
grin
which
the
mask
wears
made
me
credit
them
with
an
almost
human
humour
i
thought
the
fox
a
merry
devil
though
a
bloody
one
then
he
is
one
against
many
who
keeps
his
end
up
and
lives
often
snugly
in
spite
of
the
world
the
pirate
and
the
nightrider
are
nothing
to
the
fox
for
romance
and
danger
this
way
of
life
of
his
makes
it
difficult
to
observe
him
in
a
free
state
at
close
quarters
once
in
the
early
spring
in
the
very
early
morning
i
saw
a
vixen
playing
with
her
cubs
in
the
open
space
below
a
beech
tree
once
i
came
upon
a
big
in
a
yard
and
watched
him
from
within
a
few
paces
for
some
minutes
twice
i
have
watched
cubs
stalking
rabbits
twice
out
hunting
the
fox
has
broken
cover
within
three
yards
of
me
these
are
the
only
free
foxes
which
i
have
seen
at
close
quarters
foxes
are
animals
to
know
them
well
one
should
have
cat
eyes
and
foxes
habits
by
the
imagination
alone
can
men
know
foxes
when
i
was
about
halfway
through
my
poem
i
found
a
dead
in
a
field
near
cumnor
hurst
he
was
a
fine
fox
in
perfect
condition
he
must
have
picked
up
poison
for
he
had
not
been
hunted
nor
shot
on
the
pads
of
this
dead
fox
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
length
and
strength
of
a
fox
claws
some
have
asked
whether
the
ghost
heath
run
is
founded
on
any
recorded
run
of
any
real
hunt
it
is
not
it
is
an
imaginary
run
in
a
country
made
up
of
many
different
pieces
of
country
some
of
them
real
some
of
them
imaginary
these
real
and
imaginary
fields
woods
and
brooks
are
taken
as
they
exist
from
berkshire
where
the
fox
lives
from
herefordshire
where
he
was
found
from
trapalanda
gloucestershire
buckinghamshire
herefordshire
worcestershire
and
berkshire
where
he
ran
from
trapalanda
where
he
nearly
died
and
from
a
wild
and
beautiful
corner
in
berkshire
where
he
rests
from
his
run
some
have
asked
when
the
poem
was
written
it
was
written
between
january
and
may
some
have
asked
whether
hunting
will
soon
be
abolished
i
can
not
tell
but
i
think
it
unlikely
people
do
not
willingly
resign
their
pleasures
men
who
breed
horses
will
want
to
gallop
them
across
country
hunting
is
a
pleasure
as
well
as
an
opportunity
to
gallop
it
is
also
an
instinct
in
man
some
have
thought
that
if
small
holdings
that
is
produce
gardens
intensively
cultivated
of
about
an
acre
apiece
became
common
so
that
the
country
became
more
rigidly
enclosed
than
at
present
hunting
would
be
made
almost
impossible
the
small
holding
is
generally
the
property
of
the
small
farmer
like
the
french
cultivateur
who
fences
permanently
with
wire
and
can
not
take
down
the
wire
during
the
hunting
season
as
most
english
farmers
do
at
present
small
holdings
will
probably
increase
in
number
near
towns
but
farmers
seem
agreed
that
they
can
never
become
the
national
system
of
farming
the
big
farm
that
can
treat
the
great
tract
with
machines
seems
likely
to
be
the
farm
of
the
future
even
if
the
small
holdings
system
were
to
prevail
it
would
hardly
prevail
over
the
sporting
instincts
of
the
race
beauty
and
delight
are
stronger
than
the
will
to
work
i
am
pretty
sure
that
a
pack
of
hounds
coming
feathery
by
at
the
heels
of
a
whip
horse
while
the
field
takes
station
and
the
huntsman
drawing
his
horn
prepares
to
hunt
would
shake
the
resolve
of
most
small
holders
digging
in
their
lots
with
thrift
industry
and
and
then
if
the
huntsman
were
to
blow
his
horn
and
the
hounds
to
feather
on
it
and
give
tongue
and
find
and
go
away
at
head
i
am
pretty
sure
that
most
of
the
small
holders
of
this
race
would
follow
them
it
is
in
this
race
to
hunt
i
will
conclude
with
a
portrait
of
old
baldy
hill
the
who
in
the
darkness
of
the
early
morning
gads
about
on
a
pony
to
stop
or
put
to
all
earths
in
which
a
fox
might
hide
in
the
poem
he
enters
when
the
hunt
is
about
to
start
but
he
is
an
important
figure
in
a
hunting
community
and
deserves
a
portrait
he
may
come
here
at
the
beginning
for
baldy
hill
is
at
the
beginning
of
all
fox
hunts
he
dates
from
the
beginning
of
man
i
have
seen
many
a
baldy
hill
in
my
life
he
never
fails
to
give
me
the
feeling
that
he
is
primitive
man
survived
primitive
man
lived
like
that
in
the
woods
in
the
darkness
outwitting
the
wild
things
while
the
rain
dripped
and
the
owl
cried
and
the
ghost
came
out
from
the
grave
baldy
hill
stole
the
last
litter
of
the
last
to
cross
them
with
the
hounds
he
was
in
at
the
death
of
the
last
sometimes
in
looking
at
him
i
think
that
his
ashen
stake
must
have
a
flint
head
with
which
on
moony
nights
he
still
creeps
out
to
rouse
it
may
be
the
mammoth
in
his
secret
valley
or
a
sabretooth
tiger
still
caved
in
the
woods
life
may
and
does
shoot
out
into
exotic
forms
which
may
and
do
flower
and
perish
perhaps
when
all
the
other
forms
of
english
life
are
gone
the
baldy
hill
form
the
stock
form
will
abide
still
striding
head
bent
with
an
ashen
stake
after
some
wild
thing
that
has
meat
or
fur
or
is
difficult
or
dangerous
to
tackle
old
baldy
hill
the
game
old
cock
still
wore
and
a
smock
he
bore
a
five
foot
ashen
stick
all
scarred
and
pilled
from
many
a
click
beating
in
covert
with
his
sons
to
drive
the
pheasants
to
the
guns
his
face
was
beaten
by
the
weather
to
wrinkled
red
like
bellows
leather
he
had
a
cold
clear
hard
blue
eye
his
snares
made
many
a
rabbit
die
on
moony
nights
he
found
it
pleasant
to
stare
the
woods
for
roosting
pheasant
up
near
the
on
the
bough
he
never
trod
behind
a
plough
he
and
his
two
sons
got
their
food
from
wild
things
in
the
field
and
wood
by
snares
by
ferrets
put
in
holes
by
ridding
of
moles
by
keeping
beating
trapping
poaching
and
he
and
his
sons
had
special
merits
in
breeding
and
in
handling
ferrets
full
many
a
snaky
hob
and
jill
had
bit
the
thumbs
of
baldy
hill
he
had
no
beard
but
long
white
hair
he
bent
in
gait
he
used
to
wear
flowers
in
his
smock
and
peasen
and
in
hunting
season
i
hope
that
he
may
live
to
wear
for
many
seasons
to
come
hunting
makes
more
people
happy
than
anything
i
know
when
people
are
happy
together
i
am
quite
certain
that
they
build
up
something
eternal
something
both
beautiful
and
divine
which
weakens
the
power
of
all
evil
things

this
life

so
sharp
that
many
feared
to
clutch
so
keen
that
many
thought
her
bitter
she
let
the

twitter
she
had
a
hard
ungracious
way
her
storm

was
and
she
was
passionate
in
her
heart
for
women
souls
that
burn
apart
just
as
her

had
with

she
gave
the
sense
of
smouldering
fire
she
was
not
happy
being
a
maid
at
home
with
squire
but
she
stayed
enduring
life
however
bleak
to
guard
her
sisters
who
were
weak
and
force
a
life
for
them
from
squire
and
she
had
roused
and
stood
his
fire
a
hundred
times
and
earned
his
hate
to
win
those
two
a
better
state
long
years
before
the
canon
son
had
cared
for
her
but
he
had
gone
to
klondyke
to
the
mines
for
gold
to
find
in
some
strange
way
untold
a
foreign
grave
that
no
men
knew
no
depth
nor
beauty
was
in
lu
but
charm
and
fun
for
she
was
merry
round
sweet
and
little
like
a
cherry
with
laughter
like
a
robin
singing
she
was
not
kittenlike
and
clinging
but
pert
and
arch
and
fond
of
flirting
in
mocking
ways
that
were
not
hurting
and
merry
ways
that
women
pardoned
not
being
married
yet
she
gardened
she
loved
sweet
music
she
would
sing
songs
made
before

him
a
rider
groom

weathered
to

scarred
by
the

of
hawthorn
sprays
dashed
thro

down
on

those
flashing
brooks
in
good
sound
grass
where
scent
would
hang
like

on

he
loved
the

made

the
purr
of
the

tore
the

from

fed
the
smack
of
joy
of
the
horny
lips
marbled
green
with

he
saw
the

was

would
lie
at

reached

worsened

slacken

he
felt
that
the

link
which
bound
his

to

of

was
snapped
that
the

no

he
the

the

the
fox
heard
hounds
get
on
to
his
line
and
again
the
terror
went
down
his
spine
again
the
back
of
his
neck
felt
cold
from
the
sense
of
the
hound
teeth
taking
hold
but
his
legs
were
rested
his
heart
was
good
he
had
breath
to
gallop
to
mourne
end

it
was
four
miles
more
but
an
earth
at
end
so
he
put
on
pace
down
the
rood
hill
bend
illustration
the
fox
heard
hounds
get
on
to
his
line
down
the
great

slope
which
the
oak
trees
dot
with
a
swerve
to
the
right
from
the
keeper
cot
over
high
clench
brook
in
its

deep
to
the

beyond

he
ran

sheep
the
sheep
formed

a
troop
of
horse
they
swerved
as
he
passed
to

his
course
from
behind
as
he
ran
a
cry
arose
see
the
sheep
there
watch
them
there
he
goes
he
ran
the
sheep
that
their
smell
might
check
the
hounds
from
his
scent
and
save
his
neck
but
in
two

more
he
was
made

as
they
meant
to

they
were
running
hard
with
a
burning
scent
and
robin
could
see
which
way
he
went
the
pace
that
he
went
brought
strain
to
breath
he
knew
as
he
ran
that
the
grass
was
death
he
ran
the
slope
towards
morton
tew
that
the

of

at

yew

dark

evil

burrowed
deep
with

where

he
saw
his
point
on
the
heaving
hill
he
had
failing
flesh
and
a
reeling
will
he
felt
the
heave
of
the
hill
grow
stiff
he
saw
black
woods
which
would
shelter
if
nothing
else
but
the
steepening
slope
and
a
black
line
nodding
a
line
of
hope
the
line
of
the

this

but
the
pace
uphill
made
a
horse
like
stone
the
pack
went
wild
up
the
hill
alone
three
hundred
yards
and
the
worst
was
past
the
slope
was
gentler
and
the
fox
saw
the
bulk
of
the
woods
grow
tall
on
the
brae
ahead
like
a
he
saw
the
skeleton
trees
show
sky
and
the
yew
trees
darken
to
see
him
die
and
the
line
of
the
woods
go
reeling
black
there
was
hope
in
the
woods
and
behind
the
pack
two
hundred
yards
and
the
trees
grew
taller
blacker
blinder
as
hope
grew
smaller
cry
seemed
nearer
the
teeth
seemed
gripping
pulling
him
back
his
pads
seemed
slipping
he
was
all
one
ache
one
gasp
one
thirsting
heart
on
his
beating
bursting
the
hounds
were
gaining
like
spotted
pards
and
the
still
was
a
hundred
yards
the
black
was
a
two
year
quick
that
had
sprouted
thick
thorns
all
over
and
strongly
plied
with
a
clean
red
ditch
on
the
side
he
saw
it
now
as
a
redness
topped
with
a
wattle
of
spiky
cropped
spiky
to
leap
on
stiff
to
force
no
safe
jump
for
a
failing
horse
but
beyond
it
darkness
of
yews
together
dark
green
plumes
over
soft
brown
feather
darkness
of
woods
where
scents
were
blowing
strange
scents
hot
scents
of
wild
things
going
scents
that
might
draw
these
hounds
away
so
he
ran
ran
ran
to
that
clean
red
clay
illustration
he
saw
it
now
as
a
redness
topped
with
a
wattle
of
spiky
cropped
still
as
he
ran
his
pads
slipped
back
all
his
strength
seemed
to
draw
the
pack
the
trees
drew
over
him
dark
like
norns
he
was
over
the
ditch
and
at
the
thorns
he
thrust
at
the
thorns
which
would
not
yield
he
leaped
but
fell
in
sight
of
the
field
the
hounds
went
wild
as
they
saw
him
fall
the
fence
stood
stiff
like
a
bucks
flint
wall
he
gathered
himself
for
a
new
attempt
his
life
before
was
an
old
dream
dreamt
all
that
he
was
was
a
blown
fox
quaking
jumping
at
thorns
too
stiff
for
breaking
while
over
the
grass
in
crowd
in
cry
came
the
grip
teeth
grinning
to
make
him
die
the
eyes
intense
dull
smouldering
red
the
fell
like
a
ruff
round
each
keen
head
the
pace
like
fire
and
scarlet
men
galloping
yelling
yooi
eat
him
then
he
gathered
himself
he
leaped
he
reached
the
top
of
the
hedge
like
a
beached
he
steadied
a
second
and
then
leaped
down
to
the
dark
of
the
wood
where
bright
things
drown
he
swerved
sharp
right
under
young
green
firs
robin
called
on
the
dane
with
spurs
he
cried
come
dansey
if
god
not
good

shall
change

fox
in
this

tom
cried
back
as

dane
he
gripped
him
tight
and
he
made
it
plain
he
slowed
him
down
till
he
almost
stood
while
his
hounds
went
crash
into
mourne
end
wood
like
a
dainty
dancer
with
footing
nice
the
dane
turned
side
for
a
leap
in
twice
he
cleared
the
ditch
to
the
red
clay
bank
he
rose
at
the
fence
as
his
quarters
sank
he
barged
the
fence
as
the
bank
gave
way
and
down
he
came
in
a
fall
of
clay
robin
jumped
off
him
and
gasped
for
breath
he
said
that
lost
him
as
sure
as
death
they
him
come
up
the
dane
but
i
kill
him
yet
if
we
ride
to
spain
he
scrambled
up
to
his
horse
back
he
thrust
through
cover
he
called
his
pack
he
cheered
them
on
till
they
made
it
good
where
the
fox
had
swerved
inside
the
wood
the
fox
knew
well
as
he
ran
the
dark
that
the
headlong
hounds
were
past
their
mark
they
had
missed
his
swerve
and
had
overrun
but
their
devilish
play
was
not
yet
done
done
for
a
minute
he
ran
and
heard
no
sound
then
a
whimper
came
from
a
questing
hound
then
a
this
way
beauties
and
then
leu
leu
the
floating
laugh
of
the
horn
that
blew
then
the
cry
again
and
the
crash
and
rattle
of
the
shrubs
burst
back
as
they
ran
to
battle
till
the
wood
behind
seemed
risen
from
root
crying
and
crashing
to
give
pursuit
till
the
trees
seemed
hounds
and
the
air
seemed
cry
and
the
earth
so
far
that
he
needs
but
die
die
where
he
reeled
in
the
woodland
dim
with
a
hound
white
grips
in
the
spine
of
him
for
one
more
burst
he
could
spurt
and
then
wait
for
the
teeth
and
the
wrench
and
men
he
made
his
spurt
for
the
mourne
end
rocks
the
air
blew
rank
with
the
taint
of
fox
the
yews
gave
way
to
a
greener
space
of
great
stones
strewn
in
a
grassy
place
and
there
was
his
earth
at
the
great
grey
shoulder
sunk
in
the
ground
of
a
granite
boulder
a
dry
deep
burrow
with
rocky
roof
proof
against
crowbars
life
to
the
dying
rest
for
bones
the
earth
was
stopped
it
was
filled
with
stones
then
for
a
moment
his
courage
failed
his
eyes
looked
up
as
his
body
quailed
then
the
coming
of
death
which
all
things
dread
made
him
run
for
the
wood
ahead
illustration
there
were
foxes
there
the
taint
of
fox
was
rank
on
the
air
he
knew
as
he
ran
there
were
foxes
there
his
strength
was
broken
his
heart
was
bursting
his
bones
were
rotten
his
throat
was
thirsting
his
feet
were
reeling
his
brush
was
thick
from
dragging
the
mud
and
his
brain
was
sick
he
thought
as
he
ran
of
his
old
delight
in
the
wood
in
the
moon
in
an
april
night
his
happy
hunting
his
winter
loving
the
smells
of
things
in
the
midnight
roving
the
look
of
his
red
dam
with
her
footpad
tread
of
his
sire
so
swift
so
game
so
cunning
with
craft
in
his
brain
and
power
of
running
their
fights
of
old
when
his
teeth
drew
blood
now
he
was
sick
with
his
coat
all
mud
he
crossed
the
covert
he
crawled
the
bank
to
a
meuse
in
the
thorns
and
there
he
sank
with
his
ears
flexed
back
and
his
teeth
shown
white
in
a
rat
resolve
for
a
dying
bite
prize
and
there
as
he
lay
he
saw
the
vale
that
a
struggling
sunlight
silvered
pale

above

the
blue
blown
hilcote
copse
where
he
and
his
mates
had
long
made
merry
in
the
bloody
joys
of
the
and
there
as
he
lay
and
looked
the
cry
of
the
hounds
at
head
came
rousing
by

bent
his
bones
in
the
blackthorn
dim

the
cry
of
the
hounds
was
not
for
him
over
the
fence
with
a
crash
they
went
belly
to
grass

a
burning
scent

came
