preface
the
present
edition
of
the
poetical
works
of
philip
freneau
was
begun
at
the
advice
of
the
late
lamented
moses
coit
tyler
in
his
opinion
there
were
few
fields
in
american
history
that
needed
exploring
more
and
few
that
would
require
on
the
part
of
the
explorer
more
of
the
columbus
spirit
it
would
be
almost
impossible
for
a
poet
to
pass
more
completely
into
the
shadow
than
has
freneau
during
the
century
since
his
activities
closed
his
poems
are
almost
all
of
them
in
their
earliest
editions
exceedingly
rare
and
costly
and
only
to
be
read
by
those
who
can
have
access
to
the
largest
libraries
his
letters
and
papers
have
almost
entirely
disappeared
and
his
biography
in
almost
every
book
of
reference
has
been
so
distorted
by
misstatement
and
omission
as
to
be
really
grotesque
this
neglect
has
resulted
not
from
lack
of
real
worth
in
the
man
but
from
prejudices
born
during
one
of
the
most
bitter
and
stormy
eras
of
partisan
politics
that
america
has
ever
known
what
sidney
smith
said
of
scotland
at
this
period
was
true
here
the
principles
of
the
french
revolution
were
fully
afloat
and
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
a
more
violent
and
agitated
state
of
society
freneau
was
a
victim
of
this
intense
era
new
england
rejected
him
with
scorn
and
all
admirers
of
washington
echoed
his
epithet
that
rascal
freneau
thus
it
has
become
the
tradition
to
belittle
his
work
to
vilify
his
character
and
to
sum
up
his
whole
career
as
a
prominent
new
englander
has
recently
done
by
alluding
to
him
as
a
creature
of
the
opposition
unprejudiced
criticism
however
has
always
exalted
freneau
work
the
great
scotch
dictator
jeffrey
with
all
his
scorn
for
american
literature
could
say
that
the
time
would
arrive
when
his
poetry
like
that
of
hudibras
would
command
a
commentator
like
gray
and
sir
walter
scott
once
declared
that
eutaw
springs
was
as
fine
a
thing
as
there
is
of
the
kind
in
the
language
duyckinck
did
not
hesitate
to
group
him
as
one
of
four
of
the
most
original
writers
whom
the
country
has
produced
and
benjamin
could
say
in
in
all
the
history
of
american
letters
or
of
the
united
states
press
there
is
no
figure
more
interesting
or
remarkable
no
career
more
versatile
and
varied
than
that
of
philip
freneau
such
testimony
might
be
multiplied
surely
had
the
poet
been
an
ordinary
man
jefferson
would
never
have
said
his
paper
has
saved
our
constitution
madison
would
not
have
pronounced
him
a
man
of
genius
and
adams
would
hardly
have
admitted
that
he
was
a
leading
element
in
his
defeat
i
have
endeavored
not
only
to
rescue
the
most
significant
of
poems
but
to
arrange
them
as
far
as
possible
in
their
order
of
composition
or
at
least
in
the
order
in
which
they
first
appeared
in
print
it
has
seemed
to
me
highly
important
to
do
this
since
such
an
arrangement
especially
with
a
poet
like
freneau
who
drew
his
themes
almost
wholly
from
the
range
of
his
own
observation
would
be
virtually
an
autobiography
and
since
it
would
also
furnish
a
running
commentary
upon
the
history
of
a
stirring
period
in
our
annals
the
task
has
been
no
slight
one
it
has
necessitated
a
search
through
the
files
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
early
newspapers
and
periodicals
and
a
minute
investigation
of
every
other
source
of
possible
information
much
material
has
been
rescued
that
as
far
as
the
public
was
concerned
had
practically
become
extinct
i
have
introduced
the
unique
fragment
of
an
unpublished
drama
the
spy
which
i
was
the
first
to
explore
i
have
taken
pains
to
reproduce
the
poet
early
poetical
pamphlets
dealing
with
the
first
year
of
the
revolution
not
one
of
which
has
ever
been
republished
the
revisions
of
many
of
these
used
by
freneau
in
his
later
collections
were
so
thoroughgoing
as
to
be
in
reality
entirely
new
poems
the
voyage
to
boston
for
instance
published
during
the
siege
of
boston
was
cut
down
for
the
edition
from
six
hundred
and
five
lines
to
three
hundred
and
six
lines
and
of
these
more
than
half
were
entirely
changed
from
the
standpoint
of
the
historian
at
least
the
original
version
is
much
more
valuable
than
that
made
several
years
after
the
war
was
over
this
is
true
of
all
the
earlier
pamphlet
poems
aside
from
their
value
as
specimens
of
freneau
earlier
muse
they
are
valuable
commentaries
on
the
history
of
the
stormy
times
that
called
them
forth
and
i
have
not
hesitated
to
reprint
them
verbatim
in
connection
with
the
revised
versions
the
pamphlet
poems
american
liberty
and
general
gage
confession
until
recently
supposed
to
have
been
lost
exist
only
in
unique
copies
freneau
never
attempted
to
revise
them
some
of
the
other
early
poems
notably
the
house
of
night
i
have
annotated
with
care
showing
the
evolution
of
the
poem
from
its
first
nucleus
to
its
final
fragmentary
form
in
the
case
of
a
few
of
the
more
important
poems
especially
those
dealing
with
the
revolution
i
have
given
variorum
readings
aside
from
this
early
material
which
has
a
real
historical
value
i
have
introduced
very
few
poems
not
included
in
freneau
collected
editions
of
and
previous
to
the
poet
reprinted
with
miserly
care
almost
all
the
verses
which
he
had
contributed
to
the
press
in
his
later
years
he
was
more
prodigal
of
his
creations
i
have
however
reprinted
from
newspapers
very
few
poems
not
found
elsewhere
and
these
few
only
on
the
best
evidence
that
they
were
genuine
for
it
has
been
my
experience
that
when
a
poem
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
collected
editions
of
the
poet
it
is
almost
certain
that
it
is
not
genuine
in
justice
to
freneau
who
had
the
welfare
of
his
writings
much
at
heart
and
who
cut
and
pruned
and
remodeled
with
tireless
hand
i
have
usually
given
the
latest
version
i
wish
to
acknowledge
here
my
great
indebtedness
to
the
descendants
of
philip
freneau
especially
miss
adele
sweeney
weymer
j
mills

and
eleanor

who
have
allowed
me
to
consult
freely
all
the
papers
and
literary
remains
of
the
poet
and
have
supplied
me
with
all
possible
information
i
would
also
express
my
great
obligation
to
many
librarians
collectors
and
scholars
who
have
cheerfully
aided
me

life
of
philip
freneau
i
in
the
possession
of
the
freneau
descendants
there
is
an
old
french
bible
printed
in
geneva
switzerland
in
which
preserves
an
unbroken
roll
of
the
heads
of
the
family
back
to
the
original
owner
of
the
book
philip
fresneau
who
on
his
in
la
chapelle
france
in
gave
it
into
the
hands
of
his
eldest
son
for
five
generations
the
book
remained
in
the
little
suburban
village
its
possessors
sturdy
industrious
tradesmen
who
stood
high
in
the
esteem
of
their
community
and
yet
who
on
account
of
their
protestant
faith
were
often
imposed
upon
and
at
times
even
persecuted
it
was
doubtless
this
feeling
of
insecurity
if
not
positive
persecution
which
compelled
andré
fresneau
like
so
many
of
his
fellow
huguenots
to
leave
his
native
village
and
to
seek
a
home
in
a
more
tolerant
land
he
landed
in
new
york
in
he
was
in
his
year
an
active
handsome
man
almost
brilliant
in
certain
directions
of
pleasing
address
and
skilled
from
his
youth
in
the
handling
of
affairs
he
became
at
once
a
leader
in
the
little
huguenot
colony
whose
center
was
the
quaint
old
church
du
esprit
on
pine
street
he
was
soon
in
the
midst
of
a
thriving
shipping
business
dealing
largely
in
imported
wines
and
in
three
years
after
his
arrival
he
was
able
to
furnish
a
beautiful
home
on
pearl
street
near
hanover
square
for
his
young
bride
mary
morin
a
daughter
of
pierre
morin
of
the
french
congregation
of
the
comfort
and
hospitality
of
this
home
there
are
many
contemporary
references
john
fontaine
the
french
traveller
was
entertained
here
in
and
he
speaks
highly
of
his
host
and
his
entertainment
in
fresneau
died
at
the
early
age
of
leaving
behind
a
family
of
five
children
the
oldest
only
nine
years
of
age
four
years
later
the
father
followed
but
the
young
family
was
far
from
destitute
the
business
house
in
new
york
had
grown
to
be
very
profitable
and
there
was
a
large
landed
estate
in
eastern
new
jersey
a
part
of
which
was
sold
in
soon
the
two
eldest
sons
andrew
born
and
pierre
born
january
were
able
to
continue
their
father
business
for
years
their
firm
name
was
familiar
in
new
york
pierre
freneau
the
family
seem
to
have
dropped
the
s
about
was
married
in
to
agnes
watson
daughter
of
richard
watson
of
freehold
whose
property
bordered
upon
the
freneau
estate
they
made
their
home
in
frankfort
street
new
york
and
here
on
january
was
born
their
eldest
child
philip
morin
freneau
the
subject
of
our
sketch
four
other
children
came
from
their
union
of
whom
only
one
peter
born
april
who
in
later
years
became
a
prominent
figure
in
charleston
need
be
mentioned
the
home
of
the
freneau
was
one
of
comfort
and
even
refinement
there
was
a
large
and
well
selected
library
the
pride
of
its
owner
there
he
would
say
to
his
visitors
pointing
to
his
books
use
them
freely
for
among
them
you
will
find
your
truest
friends
he
delighted
in
men
of
refinement
and
his
home
became
a
social
center
for
the
lovers
of
books
and
of
culture
he
looked
carefully
after
the
education
of
his
children
and
all
of
them
early
became
omnivorous
readers
in
such
an
environment
the
young
poet
passed
his
first
ten
years
in
the
family
decided
to
leave
new
york
and
to
make
their
home
permanently
on
their
estate
mount
pleasant
near
middletown
point
j
the
estate
at
this
time
contained
nearly
a
thousand
acres
and
with
its
large
buildings
its
slaves
and
its
broad
area
under
cultivation
was
in
many
respects
like
a
southern
plantation
heretofore
the
elder
freneau
had
made
it
of
secondary
importance
he
had
used
it
as
a
summer
resort
and
as
a
pleasant
relief
to
the
monotony
of
his
city
business
but
now
perhaps
on
account
of
failing
health
he
determined
to
devote
to
it
all
of
his
energies
philip
was
left
behind
in
new
york
for
the
next
three
years
he
lived
at
a
boarding
school
in
the
city
going
home
only
during
the
long
vacations
at
the
age
of
thirteen
he
was
sent
to
the
latin
school
at
penolopen
then
presided
over
by
the
rev
alexander
mitchell
to
prepare
for
college
the
father
of
the
family
died
this
however
did
not
disturb
the
plans
of
the
eldest
son
and
on
he
entered
the
sophomore
class
at
princeton
so
well
prepared
that
president
witherspoon
is
said
to
have
sent
a
letter
of
congratulation
to
his
mother
ii
of
the
college
life
of
philip
freneau
we
have
only
fragmentary
records
he
was
in
his
sixteenth
year
when
he
entered
a
somewhat
dreamy
youth
who
had
read
very
widely
especially
in
the
english
poets
and
the
latin
classics
and
who
already
commanded
a
facile
pen
especially
in
the
field
of
heroic
verse
during
the
year
in
which
he
entered
princeton
he
composed
two
long
poems
the
history
of
the
prophet
jonah
and
the
village
merchant
surely
notable
work
for
the
pen
of
a
college
sophomore
during
the
following
year
he
wrote
the
pyramids
of
egypt
and
before
his
graduation
he
had
completed
several
other
pieces
some
of
them
full
of
real
poetic
inspiration
the
period
during
which
freneau
resided
at
princeton
was
a
most
significant
one
in
the
same
class
with
him
were
james
madison
brackenridge
the
author
of
modern
chivalry
and
a
conspicuous
figure
in
later
pennsylvania
history
and
samuel
spring
who
was
to
become
widely
influential
in
religious
circles
in
the
class
below
him
were
the
refined
and
scholarly
william
bradford
and
the
brilliant
aaron
burr
the
shadow
of
the
coming
struggle
with
great
britain
was
already
lengthening
over
the
colonies
and
nowhere
was
its
presence
more
manifest
than
in
the
colleges
always
the
most
sensitive
areas
in
times
of
tyranny
and
oppression
on
august
the
senior
class
at
princeton
voted
unanimously
to
appear
at
commencement
dressed
in
american
manufactures
another
circumstance
made
the
period
a
notable
one
on
june
a
little
band
of
students
headed
by
madison
brackenridge
bradford
and
freneau
organized
an
undergraduate
fraternity
to
be
called
the
american
whig
society
one
year
later
the
well
meaning
club
a
rival
literary
organization
founded
in
became
the
cliosophic
society
the
act
was
the
signal
for
a
war
the
echoes
of
which
have
even
yet
not
died
away
at
princeton
there
exists
a
manuscript
book
rescued
from
the
papers
of
william
bradford
in
which
are
preserved
the
poetic
tirades
called
forth
in
this
first
onset
its
title
page
is
as
follows
satires
against
the
tories
written
in
the
last
war
between
the
whigs
cliosophians
in
which
the
former
obtained
a
compleat
victory
arm
for
virtue
now
we
point
the
pen
brand
the
bold
front
of
shameless
guilty
men
dash
the
proud
tory
in
his
gilded
car
bare
the
mean
heart
that
hides
beneath
a
star
it
opens
with
ten
pastorals
by
brackenridge
of
which
the
ninth
begins
thus
spring
soliloquy
that
morning
before
he
hung
himself
o
world
adieu
the
doleful
time
draws
nigh
i
can
not
live
and
yet
i
fear
to
die
warford
is
dead
and
in
his
turn
freneau
will
send
me
headlong
to
the
shades
below
what
raging
fury
or
what
baleful
star
did
find
ingulph
me
in
the
whiggish
war
the
deeds
of
darkness
which
my
soul
hath
done
are
now
apparent
as
the
sun
a
thousand
things
as
yet
remain
untold
my
secret
practice
and
my
sins
of
old
then
follow
several
satires
by
freneau
full
of
fire
and
invective
but
like
the
work
of
all
the
others
not
always
refined
or
quotable
in
print
his
satire
mcswiggen
printed
in
contains
nearly
half
of
the
poems
the
only
lines
indeed
which
are
of
any
real
merit
the
three
concluding
poems
of
the
collection
and
these
by
all
means
the
worst
of
the
lot
are
from
no
less
a
pen
than
madison
no
patriotic
citizen
will
ever
venture
to
resurrect
them
there
is
a
tradition
very
widely
current
that
freneau
was
for
a
time
the
of
madison
however
this
may
be
there
is
no
question
as
to
who
was
his
most
intimate
friend
with
brackenridge
he
had
much
in
common
both
had
dreams
of
a
literary
life
both
had
read
largely
in
polite
literature
both
scribbled
constantly
in
prose
and
verse
in
the
same
manuscript
volume
with
the
satires
there
is
an
extensive
fragment
of
a
novel
written
alternately
by
brackenridge
and
freneau
between
september
and
october
its
manuscript
title
page
is
as
follows
father
bombo
pilgrimage
to
mecca
in
arabia
vol
ii
wherein
is
given
a
true
account
of
the
innumerable
and
surprizing
adventures
which
befell
him
in
the
course
of
that
long
and
tedious
journey
till
he
once
more
returned
safe
to
his
native
land
as
related
by
his
own
mouth
written
by
and
mutato
nomine
fabula
de
te
narratur
change
but
the
name
the
story
told
of
you
mdviilxx
the
adventures
of
the
hero
read
like
chapters
from
the
arabian
nights
he
has
been
for
seven
days
a
close
captive
on
a
french
but
he
is
rescued
by
an
irish
privateer
only
to
be
taken
for
a
wizard
and
thrown
overboard
in
a
cask
which
is
finally
washed
ashore
on
the
north
coast
of
ireland
it
would
be
useless
to
recount
all
of
his
adventures
both
afloat
and
ashore
he
finally
succeeds
in
reaching
mecca
and
in
returning
safely
home
to
america
the
final
chapter
recounts
the
details
of
his
death
and
moralizes
on
his
life
and
character
the
work
is
crude
and
hasty
whole
chapters
of
it
were
evidently
written
at
one
sitting
the
part
signed
is
unquestionably
the
best
the
prose
is
vigorous
and
the
movement
rapid
the
only
merit
in
section
lies
in
its
lyric
lament
at
the
close
of
one
of
the
chapters
the
hero
suddenly
bursts
into
minor
song
the
opening
stanzas
of
which
are
sweet
are
the
that
crown
the
vale
and
sweet
the
spicy
breathing
gale
that
murmurs
the
hills
see
how
the
distant
lowing
throng
thro
verdant
pastures
move
along
or
drink
the
limpid
streams
and
crystal
rills
ah
see
in
yonder
gloomy
grove
the
shepherd
tells
his
tale
of
love
and
clasps
the
wanton
fair
while
winds
and
trees
and
shades
conspire
to
fann
with
love
the
gentle
fire
and
banish
every
black
and
boding
care
but
what
has
love
to
do
with
me
unknown
ashore
distress
by
sea
now
to
the
tomb
whilst
here
i
rove
and
pine
and
weep
sav
from
the
fury
of
the
deep
to
find
alas
on
shore
a
harder
doom
the
nature
of
the
undergraduate
work
done
by
princeton
in
freneau
time
was
thus
summed
up
by
president
witherspoon
in
his
address
to
the
inhabitants
of
jamaica
published
in
philadelphia
in
in
the
first
year
they
read
latin
and
greek
with
the
roman
and
grecian
antiquities
and
rhetoric
in
the
second
continuing
the
study
of
the
languages
they
learn
a
compleat
system
of
geography
with
the
use
of
the
globes
the
first
principles
of
philosophy
and
the
elements
of
mathematical
knowledge
the
third
though
the
languages
are
not
wholly
omitted
is
chiefly
employed
in
mathematics
and
natural
philosophy
and
the
senior
year
is
employed
in
reading
the
higher
classics
proceeding
in
the
mathematics
and
natural
philosophy
and
going
through
a
course
of
moral
philosophy
in
addition
to
these
the
president
gives
lectures
to
the
juniors
and
seniors
which
consequently
every
student
hears
twice
over
in
his
course
first
upon
chronology
and
history
and
afterwards
upon
composition
and
criticism
he
has
also
taught
the
french
language
last
winter
and
it
will
continue
to
be
taught
to
all
who
desire
to
learn
it
as
we
have
never
yet
been
obliged
to
omit
or
alter
it
for
want
of
scholars
there
is
a
fixed
annual
commencement
on
the
last
wednesday
of
september
when
after
a
variety
of
public
exercises
always
attended
by
a
vast
concourse
of
the
politest
company
from
the
different
parts
of
this
province
and
the
cities
of
new
york
and
philadelphia
of
freneau
proficiency
as
a
student
we
have
no
record
of
the
details
of
the
commencement
of
september
when
he
received
his
degree
we
have
but
a
brief
account
brackenridge
opened
the
exercises
with
a
salutatory
and
following
came
four
other
exercises
which
completed
the
morning
programme
the
audience
assembled
again
at
three
and
after
singing
by
the
students
there
came
an
english
forensic
dispute
on
this
question
ancient
poetry
excel
the
modern
freneau
the
respondent
his
arguments
in
favor
of
the
ancients
were
read
williamson
answered
him
and
mcknight
replied
a
poem
on
rising
glory
of
america
by
brackenridge
was
received
with
great
applause
by
the
audience
madison
on
account
of
ill
health
did
not
appear
the
rising
glory
had
been
written
conjointly
by
brackenridge
and
freneau
although
the
former
was
given
on
the
commencement
programme
full
credit
for
the
exercise
it
was
surely
freneau
who
conceived
the
work
and
who
gave
it
its
strength
and
high
literary
value
brackenridge
in
later
years
confessed
to
his
son
that
on
his
part
it
was
a
task
of
labor
while
the
verse
of
his
associate
flowed
spontaneously
the
poem
was
printed
in
philadelphia
the
following
year
and
in
freneau
isolated
his
own
portion
for
publication
in
the
first
edition
of
his
works
this
detaching
of
freneau
portion
from
the
complete
work
destroyed
at
the
outset
the
original
unity
of
the
piece
the
changes
and
omissions
made
necessary
by
the
process
of
separating
the
part
from
the
whole
the
deliberate
readjustment
of
perspective
to
bring
the
poem
up
to
the
historical
conditions
of
the
later
date
and
the
careful
editing
which
strove
to
remove
blemishes
and
weaknesses
due
to
inexperience
combine
to
make
the
version
practically
a
new
poem
the
first
glimpse
of
freneau
after
his
graduation
from
princeton
is
furnished
by
a
letter
to
madison
dated
somerset
county
in
maryland
november
if
i
am
not
wrongly
informed
by
my
memory
i
have
not
seen
you
since
last
april
you
may
recollect
i
was
then
undertaking
a
school
at
flatbush
on
long
island
i
did
not
enter
upon
the
business
it
is
certain
and
continued
in
it
thirteen
days
but
island
i
have
bid
adieu
with
all
its
bruitish
brainless
crew
the
youth
of
that
detested
place
are
void
of
reason
and
of
grace
from
flushing
hills
to
flatbush
plains
deep
ignorance
unrivalld
reigns
very
poetical
but
excuse
it
fama
non
venit
ad
aures
if
you
have
not
heard
the
rumour
of
this
story
which
by
the
by
is
told
in
various
taverns
and
eating
houses
you
must
allow
me
to
be
a
little
prolix
with
it
those
who
employed
me
were
some
gentlemen
of
new
york
some
of
them
are
bullies
some
merchants
and
others
scoundrels
they
sent
me
eight
children
the
eldest
of
whom
was
years
some
could
read
others
spell
and
a
few
stammer
over
a
chapter
of
the
bible
these
were
my
pupils
and
over
these
was
i
to
preside
my
salary
moreover
was
there
is
something
else
relating
to
that
i
shall
not
at
present
mention
after
i
forsook
them
they
proscribed
me
for
four
days
and
swore
that
if
i
was
caught
in
new
york
they
would
either
trounce
or
maim
me
but
i
luckily
escaped
with
my
goods
to
princetown
where
i
remained
till
commencement
so
much
for
this
affair
i
have
printed
a
poem
in
new
york
called
the
american
village
containing
about
lines
also
a
few
short
pieces
added
i
would
send
you
one
if
i
had
a
proper
opportunity
the
additional
poems
are
a
poem
to
the
nymph
i
never
saw
the
miserable
life
of
a
pedagogue
and
stanzas
on
an
ancient
dutch
house
on
long
island
as
to
the
main
poem
it
is
damned
by
all
good
and
judicious
judges
my
name
is
in
the
title
page
this
is
called
vanity
by
some
but
so
fond
as
youthful
bards
of
fame
i
arrived
at
this
somerset
academy
the
of
october
and
intend
to
remain
here
till
next
october
i
am
assistant
to
brakenridge
this
is
the
last
time
i
shall
enter
into
such
a
business
it
worries
me
to
death
and
by
no
means
suits
my
wandring
brain
i
would
go
over
for
the
gown
this
time
two
years
but
the
old
hag
necessity
has
got
such
a
prodigious
gripe
of
me
that
i
fear
i
shall
never
be
able
to
accomplish
it
i
believe
if
i
can
not
make
this
out
i
must
turn
quack
and
indeed
i
am
now
reading
physic
at
my
leisure
hours
that
is
when
i
am
neither
sleeping
hearing
classes
or
writing
poetry
for
these
three
take
up
all
my
time
it
is
now
late
at
night
not
an
hour
ago
i
finished
a
little
poem
of
about
lines
entitled
a
journey
to
maryland
being
the
sum
of
my
adventures
it
begins
that
fam
town
where
flood
unites
with
stream
perhaps
as
good
muse
has
your
bard
begun
to
roam
i
intend
to
write
a
terrible
satire
upon
certain
vicious
persons
of
quality
in
new
york
who
have
also
used
me
ill
and
print
it
next
fall
it
shall
contain
or
lines
sometimes
i
write
pastorals
to
shew
my
wit
to
the
woods
i
sing
a
shepherd
care
deep
to
the
woods
cyllenus
calls
me
there
the
last
retreat
of
love
and
verse
i
go
verse
made
me
mad
at
first
and
will
keep
me
so
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
heard
from
you
before
now
while
i
was
in
college
i
had
but
a
short
participation
of
your
agreeable
friendship
and
the
few
persons
i
converse
with
and
yet
fewer
whose
conversation
i
delight
in
make
me
regret
the
loss
of
it
i
have
met
with
a
variety
of
rebuffs
this
year
which
i
forbear
to
mention
i
look
like
an
unmeaning
teague
just
turn
out
of
the
hold
of
an
irish
ship
coming
down
hither
i
met
with
a
rare
adventure
at
annapolis
i
was
destitute
even
of
a
brass
farthing
i
got
clear
very
handsomely
could
one
expect
ever
to
see
you
again
if
i
travel
through
virginia
i
shall
stop
and
talk
with
you
a
day
or
two
i
should
be
very
glad
to
receive
a
letter
from
you
if
it
can
be
conveniently
forwarded
in
short
sum
qualis
eram
as
partridge
says
in
tom
jones
my
hair
is
grown
like
a
mop
and
i
have
a
huge
tuft
of
beard
directly
upon
my
chin
i
want
but
five
weeks
of
years
of
age
and
already
feel
stiff
with
age
we
have
about
students
in
this
academy
who
prey
upon
me
like
leaches
shall
i
quit
this
whimpering
pack
and
hide
my
head
in
acomack
shall
i
leave
them
and
go
pokomokes
long

prodigious
scrawl

ph
the
scene
of
freneau
new
labors
was
the
famous
old
school
near
princess
anne
which
in
was
incorporated
as
washington
academy
brackenridge
became
master
here
shortly
after
his
graduation
and
in
the
words
of
his
son
and
biographer
received
a
handsome
salary
he
continued
here
says
his
biographer
during
several
years
until
the
breaking
out
of
the
american
revolution
in
the
midst
of
a
wealthy
and
highly
polished
society
greatly
respected
as
a
man
of
genius
and
scholarship
he
used
to
speak
with
the
pride
of
a
porson
of
the
winders
the
murrays
the
parnells
and
others
who
afterward
became
distinguished
for
many
years
the
academy
drew
to
it
the
sons
of
the
best
families
of
northern
virginia
maryland
and
delaware
the
length
of
freneau
stay
in
maryland
is
uncertain
there
is
evidence
that
he
remained
as
second
master
of
the
school
for
several
years
there
is
a
tradition
in
the
family
that
it
was
the
wish
of
freneau
father
that
he
study
divinity
and
that
for
a
time
he
joined
with
brackenridge
in
preparing
for
this
profession
and
there
is
another
which
is
very
persistent
that
he
left
maryland
to
study
the
law
in
philadelphia
but
i
can
find
no
positive
evidence
the
period
between
and
is
at
best
a
vague
one
in
our
life
of
the
poet
iii
in
the
early
summer
of
freneau
suddenly
appeared
in
new
york
as
a
publicist
of
remarkable
fluency
before
november
he
had
issued
no
less
than
eight
long
poems
as
separate
publications
nearly
all
of
them
called
forth
by
the
new
crisis
in
american
affairs
beginning
with
american
liberty
issued
by
anderson
the
editor
of
the
new
patriotic
weekly
constitutional
he
published
pamphlet
after
pamphlet
in
rapid
succession
all
of
them
throwing
upon
gage
and
the
british
cause
in
boston
all
the
satire
and
invective
which
he
had
used
so
mercilessly
in
the
old
society
war
at
princeton
two
of
these
were
published
by
hugh
gaine
and
another
the
voyage
to
boston
first
issued
by
anderson
was
reprinted
at
once
in
philadelphia
all
of
them
have
fared
hardly
during
the
years
several
like
general
soliloquy
and
timothy
taurus
which
recounts
the
story
of
a
journey
made
by
freneau
to
passaic
falls
near
paterson
new
jersey
in
august
have
disappeared
entirely
one
of
them
the
general
gage
confession
has
never
been
republished
in
any
form
and
all
the
others
were
cut
down
and
altered
by
the
author
for
later
editions
until
they
were
almost
in
every
respect
entirely
new
poems
that
these
voluminous
and
vigorous
tirades
which
their
author
evidently
poured
forth
with
perfect
ease
were
criticised
and
condemned
by
the
fastidious
we
have
no
evidence
certain
it
is
that
judging
by
the
contemporary
newspaper
press
they
were
exceedingly
popular
yet
in
november
we
find
freneau
in
a
sad
state
of
discouragement
ready
to
give
up
forever
all
association
with
the
muses
some
one
envious
of
his
rising
fame
has
criticised
him
unmercifully
he
seeks
out
the
old
satires
and
after
adapting
and
reshaping
them
he
hurls
them
at
the
head
of
his
enemy
whom
he
designates
as
mcswiggen
great
jove
in
wrath
a
spark
of
genius
gave
and
bade
me
drink
the
mad
pierian
wave
hence
came
those
rhymes
with
truth
ascribed
to
me
that
urge
your
little
soul
to
jealousy
devoted
mad
man
what
inspired
your
rage
who
bade
your
foolish
muse
with
us
engage
against
a
windmill
would
you
try
your
might
against
a
castle
would
a
pigmy
fight
the
young
poet
had
begun
to
realize
how
barren
was
the
new
world
in
poetic
appreciation
how
impossible
it
was
for
even
a
true
poet
to
practice
his
art
where
few
could
appreciate
and
none
really
cared
alone
i
stand
to
meet
the
train
assisted
by
no
poets
of
the
plain
he
looked
longingly
across
the
water
where
poets
were
appreciated
long
have
i
sat
on
this
disastrous
shore
and
sighing
sought
to
gain
a
passage
to
europe
towns
where
as
our
travellers
say
poets
may
flourish
or
perhaps
they
may
the
poem
was
a
valedictory
i
to
the
sea
with
weary
steps
descend
quit
the
mean
conquest
that
such
swine
must
yield
and
leave
mcswiggen
to
enjoy
the
field
in
distant
isles
some
happier
scene

choose
and
court
in
softer
shades
the
unwilling
muse
freneau
had
determined
to
spend
the
winter
in
the
west
indies
he
had
become
acquainted
during
the
autumn
with
a
west
indian
gentleman
by
the
name
of
hanson
who
owned
large
estates
in
the
islands
and
who
sailed
master
of
his
own
vessel
upon
his
invitation
freneau
became
a
passenger
late
in
november
for
the
island
of
santa
cruz
early
in
the
voyage
the
mate
died
and
the
young
poet
his
education
outweighing
his
inexperience
in
nautical
matters
was
chosen
to
fill
his
place
the
study
of
navigation
made
necessary
by
this
step
doubtless
turned
the
direction
of
his
whole
life
for
the
next
two
years
freneau
made
his
home
on
captain
hanson
estate
on
the
island
of
santa
cruz
a
selection
from
one
of
his
letters
charmingly
describes
the
spot
the
town
at
the
west
end
is
but
mean
and
ordinary
consisting
of
a
fort
and
perhaps
or
wooden
houses
the
harbor
is
nothing
but
an
open
road
where
however
ships
lie
in
the
utmost
security
at
their
moorings
the
bottom
being
good
for
anchorage
and
the
wind
always
off
shore
about
two
miles
to
the
eastward
of
this
town
along
the
seashore
is
the
estate
of
capt
hanson
into
which
the
sea
has
formed
a
beautiful
little
bay
called
buttler
bay
about
yards
across
it
has
a
sandy
shore
and
an
excellent
landing
though
all
the
rest
of
the
shore
is
sharp
craggy
rocks
my
agreeable
residence
at
this
place
for
above
two
years
off
and
on
during
the
wars
in
america
renders
the
idea
of
it
all
too
pleasing
and
makes
me
feel
much
the
same
anxiety
at
a
distance
from
it
as
adam
did
after
he
was
banished
from
the
bowers
of
eden
he
seems
to
have
been
employed
at
intervals
by
captain
hanson
in
voyages
about
the
islands
thus
he
records
of
the
island
of
james
that
i
went
over
july
and
remained
there
eight
days
we
loaded
our
vessel
with
coral
rock
which
is
used
in
these
islands
for
burning
lime
of
a
very
excellent
quality
it
was
while
at
the
ideal
retreat
at
butler
bay
that
freneau
wrote
three
of
his
most
significant
poems
santa
cruz
the
house
of
night
and
the
jamaica
funeral
the
first
two
of
which
were
contributed
to
the
states
in
of
these
the
house
of
night
is
the
most
significant
containing
as
it
does
evidence
of
a
high
creative
power
and
a
romantic
imagination
rare
indeed
in
english
poetry
in
there
are
evidences
that
freneau
composed
the
first
draught
of
the
poem
before
leaving
for
the
west
indies
but
the
point
is
not
an
important
one
for
the
edition
of
he
nearly
doubled
the
original
version
but
in
he
cut
it
down
to
a
few
stanzas
taking
from
it
nearly
everything
which
had
made
it
a
notable
creation
on
april
freneau
sailed
from
santa
cruz
for
the
bermuda
islands
where
for
a
time
he
was
the
guest
of
the
english
governor
in
an
elaborate
letter
to
brackenridge
dated
bermuda
may
afterward
published
in
the
states
he
describes
at
length
the
islands
these
he
says
in
conclusion
are
a
few
particulars
concerning
this
little
country
where
i
resided
upwards
of
five
weeks
and
if
this
slight
description
gives
you
any
satisfaction
it
will
amply
repay
me
for
the
fatigues
i
underwent
in
sailing
thither
on
june
he
was
again
in
santa
cruz
on
the
he
set
out
on
his
homeward
voyage
after
an
absence
of
nearly
three
years
the
run
home
was
destined
to
be
eventful
off
the
delaware
capes
the
vessel
was
taken
by
the
british
but
freneau
being
a
passenger
was
landed
on
july
and
allowed
to
go
his
way
the
young
poet
now
retired
to
mount
pleasant
where
doubtless
he
quietly
remained
until
the
autumn
of
the
following
year
in
august
he
published
with
bell
in
philadelphia
the
pamphlet
poem
america
independent
on
january
brackenridge
issued
in
philadelphia
the
first
number
of
the
states
and
freneau
at
once
became
an
important
contributor
his
work
in
prose
and
verse
may
be
found
in
nearly
every
number
there
are
prose
papers
on
the
west
indies
purporting
to
be
extracts
from
the
letters
of
a
young
philosopher
and
just
returned
from
several
small
voyages
amongst
these
islands
there
are
several
early
poems
for
the
first
time
put
into
print
like
columbus
to
ferdinand
and
the
dying
elm
and
there
are
several
notable
long
poems
like
santa
cruz
and
the
house
of
night
at
least
three
of
the
poetical
contributions
were
written
expressly
for
the
magazine
george
the
third
soliloquy
psalm
cxxxvii
imitated
signed
monmouth
and
the
dialogue
between
george
and
fox
it
is
evident
however
that
freneau
though
his
work
very
greatly
strengthened
the
periodical
was
only
a
valued
contributor
the
psalm
in
the
september
issue
the
first
of
the
poems
to
bear
his
name
had
a
explaining
that
the
author
was
a
young
gentleman
to
whom
in
the
course
of
this
work
we
are
greatly
indebted
the
states
is
a
notable
landmark
in
american
literary
history
its
methods
as
we
view
them
seem
singularly
modern
and
its
materials
and
arrangement
are
indeed
remarkable
when
we
view
them
against
the
background
of
their
times
it
was
a
spirited
intensely
patriotic
and
highly
literary
periodical
the
single
fact
that
the
house
of
night
first
appeared
in
its
columns
is
enough
to
stamp
it
as
no
ordinary
work
it
died
with
its
twelfth
issue
owing
to
the
troubled
state
of
the
country
and
the
unsettled
nature
of
the
currency
then
too
the
audience
to
which
it
appealed
was
found
to
be
a
small
one
in
his
valedictory
the
editor
complains
bitterly
of
the
unliterary
atmosphere
in
america
a
large
class
he
declares
inhabit
the
region
of
stupidity
and
can
not
bear
to
have
the
tranquility
of
their
repose
disturbed
by
the
villanous
shock
of
a
book
reading
is
to
them
the
worst
of
all
torments
and
i
remember
very
well
that
at
the
commencement
of
the
work
it
was
their
language
thou
come
to
torment
us
before
the
time
we
will
now
say
to
them
on
and
take
your
rest
late
in
september
freneau
shipped
as
on
the
brig
captain
chatham
bound
for
the
azores
after
an
exciting
voyage
during
which
they
were
several
times
chased
by
british
ships
they
arrived
at
santa
cruz
in
the
island
of
teneriffe
where
they
remained
two
months
a
part
of
freneau
notebook
during
this
voyage
has
been
preserved
it
shows
him
to
have
been
a
careful
and
conscientious
student
of
navigation
making
each
day
an
observation
of
his
own
and
minutely
tabulating
his
results
his
cash
account
with
the
crew
during
the
stay
in
the
islands
is
interesting
and
suggestive
the
early
spring
of
was
spent
by
the
poet
at
the
old
home
but
his
mind
was
evidently
tossing
upon
the
ocean
he
longed
to
visit
again
his
beloved
west
indies
and
accordingly
on
the
of
may
he
took
passage
at
philadelphia
in
the
ship
for
eustatia
account
of
this
voyage
and
its
after
results
is
still
extant
a
few
quotations
will
tell
the
story
on
the
of
may
in
beating
down
the
delaware
bay
we
unfortunately
retook
a
small
sloop
from
the
refugees
loaded
with
corn
which
hindered
us
from
standing
out
to
sea
that
night
whereby
in
all
probability
we
should
have
avoided
the
enemy
which
afterwards
captured
us
friday
morning
may
the
air
very
smoky
and
the
wind
somewhat
faintish
though
it
afterward
freshened
up
the
wind
was
so
that
we
stood
off
after
putting
the
pilot
on
board
the
small
sloop
handcuffing
the
prisoners
and
sending
the
prize
to
cape
may
about
three
in
the
afternoon
we
discovered
three
sail
bearing
from
us
about
they
were
not
more
than
five
leagues
from
us
when
we
discovered
them
from
the
foretop
at
the
same
time
we
could
see
them
from
the
one
appeared
to
be
a
pretty
large
ship
the
other
two
brigs
we
soon
found
they
were
in
chase
of
us
we
therefore
tacked
immediately
set
all
sail
we
could
crowd
and
stood
back
from
the
bay
my
advice
to
the
officers
was
to
stand
for
egg
harbor
or
any
part
of
the
jersey
shore
and
run
the
ship
on
the
flats
rather
than
be
taken
but
this
was
disregarded
we
continued
to
stand
in
till
we
saw
cape
henlopen
the
frigate
in
the
meantime
gaining
on
us
apace
sun
about
half
an
hour
high
we
were
abreast
of
the
cape
close
in
when
the
wind
took
us
aback
and
immediately
after
we
were
becalmed
the
ebb
of
the
tide
at
the
same
time
setting
very
strong
out
of
the
bay
so
that
we
rather
drifted
out
our
design
was
if
possible
to
get
within
the
road
around
the
point
and
then
run
the
ship
on
shore
but
want
of
wind
and
the
tide
being
against
us
hindered
from
putting
this
into
execution
we
were
now
within
three
hundred
yards
of
the
shore
the
frigate
in
the
meantime
ran
in
the
bay
to
leeward
of
us
about
of
a
mile
her
distance
from
the
cape
hindering
it
from
becalming
her
as
it
did
us
and
began
to
bring
her
cannon
to
bear
on
us
her
two
prizes
hove
to
one
we
knew
to
be
the
brig
captain
mesnard
the
other
as
we
afterward
learned
was
a
salem
brig
from
the
west
indies
the
frigate
was
the
returning
from
charleston
to
new
york
with
the
express
of
the
former
being
taken
we
now
began
to
fire
upon
each
other
at
the
distance
of
about
three
hundred
yards
the
frigate
hulled
us
several
times
one
shot
went
betwixt
wind
and
water
which
made
the
ship
leak
amazingly
making
inches
in
thirty
minutes
we
found
our
were
but
trifles
against
the
frigate
so
we
got
our
the
only
one
we
had
pointed
from
the
cabin
windows
with
which
we
played
upon
the
frigate
for
about
half
an
hour
at
last
a
shot
came
from
the
frigate
and
striking
a
parcel
of
oars
lashed
upon
the
starboard
quarter
broke
them
all
in
two
and
continuing
its
destructive
course
struck
captain
laboyteaut
in
the
right
thigh
which
it
smashed
to
atoms
tearing
part
of
his
belly
open
at
the
same
time
with
the
splinters
from
the
oars
he
fell
from
the
close
by
me
and
for
some
time
seemed
very
busily
engaged
in
setting
his
legs
to
rights
he
died
about
eleven
the
same
night
and
next
day
was
sewed
up
in
his
hammock
and
sunk
every
shot
seemed
now
to
bring
ruin
with
it
a
lad
named
steel
had
his
arm
broken
and
some
others
complained
of
slight
wounds
whereupon
finding
the
frigate
ready
and
in
a
position
to
give
us
a
broadside
we
struck
after
having
held
a
very
unequal
contest
with
her
for
about
an
hour
as
soon
as
we
struck
one
squires
with
some
midshipmen
came
on
board
and
took
possession
of
the
vessel
freneau
at
first
supposed
that
being
a
passenger
he
would
be
taken
with
the
prize
to
new
york
and
there
released
but
despite
his
protests
he
was
driven
into
the
barge
with
the
other
prisoners
and
taken
to
the
all
his
baggage
was
left
behind
and
he
was
destined
never
to
see
it
again
arriving
on
board
the
prisoners
were
driven
between
decks
where
the
air
was
hot
and
stifling
there
were
about
one
hundred
prisoners
forward
the
stench
of
whom
was
almost
intolerable
so
many
melancholy
sights
and
dismal
countenances
made
it
a
pretty
just
representation
of
the
infernal
region
i
marched
through
a
torrent
of
cursing
and
blasphemy
to
my
station
at
the
blacksmith
vice
where
the
miserable
prisoners
were
handcuffed
two
and
two
at
last
it
came
my
turn
said
i
it
your
custom
to
handcuff
passengers
the
americans
i
am
confident
never
used
the
english
so
you
a
passenger
said
the
blacksmith
at
the
same
time
happening
to
look
up
i
saw
hugh
ray
looking
steadily
at
me
who
immediately
seized
my
hand
and
asked
me
how
i
did
you
know
him
said
holmes
the
you
are
free
from
irons
come
over
among
the
gentlemen
this
was
an
unexpected
deliverance
from
a
cursed
disgrace
which
i
hardly
knew
how
i
should
get
clear
of
after
this
i
was
used
well
by
everybody
on
the
the
reached
new
york
and
the
common
prisoners
were
sent
to
the
prison
ships
in
the
harbor
freneau
however
was
retained
with
the
officers
he
had
been
promised
his
liberty
at
the
first
possible
moment
but
on
thursday
june
at
the
office
the
charge
was
brought
by
the
second
mate
that
freneau
had
been
among
those
stationed
at
the
guns
during
the
fight
he
was
refused
parole
though
he
promised
security
in
any
amount
up
to
ten
thousand
pounds
and
the
same
day
was
placed
on
board
the
prison
ship
lying
off
the
college
in
the
north
river
freneau
experiences
during
his
stay
upon
the
have
been
described
by
him
in
graphic
style
in
his
poem
the
prison
ship
on
the
night
of
june
of
the
prisoners
formed
a
design
of
making
their
escape
in
which
they
were
favored
by
a
large
schooner
accidentally
alongside
of
us
she
was
one
that
was
destined
for
the
expedition
to
elizabeth
town
and
anchored
just
astern
of
us
we
were
then
suffered
to
continue
upon
deck
if
we
chose
till
nine
we
were
all
below
at
that
time
except
the
insurgents
who
rushed
upon
the
sentries
and
disarmed
them
in
a
moment
one
they
tied
by
his
to
the
quarter
rails
and
carried
off
his
musquet
with
them
they
were
all
hessians
the
rest
they
drove
down
with
their
arms
into
the
cabin
and
rammed
the
sentry
box
down
the
companion
in
such
a
manner
that
no
one
could
get
it
up
or
down
one
murphy
possessed
himself
of
sword
and
carried
it
off
with
him
when
the
sentries
were
all
silent
they
manned
the
ship
boat
and
boarded
the
schooner
though
the
people
on
board
attempted
to
keep
them
off
with
handspikes
the
wind
blowing
fresh
at
south
and
the
flood
of
tide
being
made
they
hoisted
sail
and
were
out
of
sight
in
a
few
minutes
those
particulars
we
learned
from
some
who
were
on
duty
but
were
unsuccessful
in
getting
into
the
boat
as
soon
as
the
sentries
got
possession
of
the
vessel
again
which
they
had
no
difficulty
in
doing
as
there
was
no
resistance
made
they
posted
themselves
at
each
hatchway
and
most
basely
and
cowardly
fired
fore
and
aft
among
us
pistols
and
musquets
for
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
without
intermission
by
the
mercy
of
god
they
touched
but
four
one
mortally
after
this
no
usage
seemed
severe
enough
for
us
on
june
freneau
who
was
weak
with
fever
was
taken
to
the
hospital
ship
lying
in
the
east
river
here
he
languished
with
an
intermittent
fever
that
threatened
constantly
to
become
putrid
and
fatal
until
july
when
the
flag
came
alongside
and
cleared
the
hospital
ship
but
the
miseries
we
endured
in
getting
to
elizabeth
town
were
many
those
that
were
very
bad
of
which
the
proportion
was
great
naturally
took
possession
of
the
hold
no
prisoner
was
allowed
to
go
to
the
cabin
so
that
i
with
twenty
or
thirty
others
were
obliged
to
sleep
out
all
night
which
was
uncommonly
cold
for
the
season
about
ten
next
morning
we
arrived
at
elizabeth
town
point
where
we
were
kept
in
the
burning
sun
several
hours
till
the
commissary
came
to
discharge
us
i
was
afflicted
with
such
pains
in
my
joints
i
could
scarcely
walk
and
besides
was
weakened
with
a
raging
fever
nevertheless
i
walked
two
miles
to
elizabeth
town
here
i
got
a
passage
in
a
wagon
to
within
a
mile
of
crow
ferry
which
i
walked
got
a
passage
over
the
ferry
and
walked
on
as
far
as
molly
budleigh
where
i
stayed
all
night
next
morning
having
breakfasted
on
some
bread
and
milk
i
set
homeward
when
i
came
to
obadiah
budleigh
corner
i
turned
to
the
right
and
came
home
round
about
through
the
woods
for
fear
of
terrifying
the
neighbors
with
my
ghastly
looks
had
i
gone
through
mount
pleasant
some
days
later
he
despatched
the
following
note
to
his
friend
at
santa
cruz
sir
i
take
this
opportunity
to
inform
you
that
instead
of
arriving
as
i
fondly
promised
myself
at
the
fragrant
groves
and
delectable
plains
of
santa
cruz
to
enjoy
the
fruits
and
flowers
of
that
happy
clime
i
was
unfortunately
taken
and
confined
on
board
a
prison
ship
at
new
york
and
afterwards
in
a
hospital
ship
where
the
damnable
draughts
of
a
german
doctor
afforded
far
different
feelings
to
my
stomach
than
the
juice
of
the
orange
or
more
nourishing
milk
of
the
cocoa
iv
on
april
there
was
established
in
philadelphia
a
new
weekly
newspaper
the
journal
or
north
american
which
was
to
be
open
to
all
parties
but
influenced
by
none
and
which
had
for
its
object
to
encourage
genius
to
deter
vice
and
disrobe
tyranny
and
misrule
of
every
plumage
the
proprietor
and
printer
of
this
paper
was
francis
bailey
who
not
long
before
had
removed
his
office
from
lancaster
pa
the
editor
and
ruling
spirit
although
his
name
during
three
years
did
not
once
appear
in
its
columns
was
philip
freneau
the
mark
of
the
young
poet
is
upon
every
page
its
opening
editorial
which
was
from
his
pen
sounded
a
note
that
was
not
once
lowered
or
weakened
while
he
was
in
control
at
no
period
of
time
in
no
era
of
important
events
from
the
first
establishment
of
social
government
have
the
liberties
of
man
have
the
rights
even
of
human
nature
been
more
deeply
interested
than
at
the
time
in
which
we
presume
to
address
you
while
liberty
the
noblest
ornament
of
society
and
without
which
no
community
can
be
well
organized
seemed
to
pine
and
sicken
under
the
trammels
of
despotic
restraint
in
every
one
of
the
ancient
nations
of
the
earth
it
fairly
promises
to
resume
its
pristine
majesty
here
and
the
new
world
begins
to
emerge
from
the
fangs
and
tyranny
of
the
old
one
of
the
first
sources
of
her
decline
in
those
countries
where
she
last
resided
spring
from
the
wanton
and
unhallowed
restraints
which
the
jealous
arm
of
despotism
hath
imposed
on
the
freedom
of
the
press
that
freemen
may
be
made
acquainted
with
the
real
state
of
their
affairs
and
that
the
characters
of
their
public
servants
both
individually
and
collectively
be
made
manifest
is
our
object
with
this
patriotic
view
and
under
the
tutelage
of
law
and
the
constitution
has
the
subscriber
opened
a
free
press
universally
free
to
every
citizen
indiscriminately
whose
principles
coincide
with
those
of
the
revolution
and
whose
object
is
confessedly
known
to
point
at
public
or
private
good
from
this
time
until
june
freneau
resided
principally
in
philadelphia
and
edited
the
journal
during
all
of
this
time
his
muse
was
exceedingly
active
he
followed
carefully
the
last
years
of
the
war
and
put
into
satiric
verse
every
movement
of
the
insolent
foe
he
sang
the
victory
of
jones
and
mourned
in
plaintive
numbers
the
dead
at
eutaw
springs
he
voiced
his
indignation
over
the
destructive
career
of
cornwallis
and
burst
into
a
at
his
fall
the
ludicrous
plight
of
rivington
and
gaine
the
distress
of
the
tories
and
the
final
departure
of
the
british
filled
him
with
glee
which
he
poured
out
in
song
after
song
it
was
his
most
prolific
and
spontaneous
period
he
wrote
too
an
abundance
of
prose
the
series
of
graceful
papers
entitled
the
pilgrim
is
from
his
pen
besides
many
a
political
study
and
literary
sketch
signed
with
a
sounding
name
everywhere
are
manifest
his
love
of
true
literature
and
his
desire
to
lead
a
merely
literary
life
but
here
and
there
are
notes
of
discouragement
barbers
can
not
possibly
exist
as
such
he
writes
among
a
people
who
have
neither
hair
nor
beards
how
then
can
a
poet
hope
for
success
in
a
city
where
there
are
not
three
persons
possessed
of
elegant
ideas
during
the
year
freneau
pen
was
very
busy
in
various
lines
of
work
it
is
probable
that
he
assisted
bailey
in
many
ways
writing
introductions
to
publications
issued
by
the
office
and
performing
the
various
other
duties
incumbent
upon
the
literary
editor
of
a
publishing
house
during
this
year
he
translated
the
new
travels
through
north
america
which
had
just
been
issued
by
the
abbé
robin
one
of
the
chaplains
of
the
french
army
in
america
and
the
translation
was
issued
first
by
bailey
and
later
by
powers
and
willis
of
boston
introduction
is
characteristic
most
of
those
accounts
of
north
america
given
to
the
public
by
british
explorators
and
others
previous
to
the
revolution
are
generally
taken
up
with
the
recitals
of
wonderful
adventures
in
the
woods
beyond
the
lakes
or
with
the
histories
and
records
of
the
wild
indian
nations
so
that
by
the
time
the
reader
gets
through
one
of
those
performances
he
never
fails
to
be
better
acquainted
with
the
and
a
hundred
others
with
their
various
customs
of
or
methods
of
making
than
with
the
most
interesting
particulars
relative
to
the
of
the
then
colonies
were
but
rarely
thought
worthy
mentioning
by
those
gentlemen
and
when
they
are
it
is
mortifying
enough
to
see
them
constantly
considered
as
mere
beasts
of
burden
calculated
solely
for
the
support
of
the
grandeur
wealth
and
omnipotence
of
than
as
men
and
our
french
author
is
more
liberal
two
years
before
the
present
peace
he
considered
the
united
states
as
a
great
independent
nation
advancing
with
hasty
strides
to
the
summit
of
power
and
sovereignty
it
was
during
this
year
that
the
poet
for
the
first
time
met
with
positive
opposition
and
abuse
oswald
the
editor
of
the
newly
established
quarrelled
with
bailey
and
a
poetical
battle
was
one
phase
of
the
contest
the
details
of
this
affair
will
be
found
in
the
proper
place
and
i
need
not
recount
them
here
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
freneau
soon
found
his
muse
assailed
by
the
meanest
of
all
critics
his
extremely
sensitive
nature
could
brook
no
criticism
his
celtic
temperament
could
fight
fiercely
in
the
presence
of
an
open
foe
but
it
was
easily
depressed
and
discouraged
by
criticism
and
covert
attack
he
lost
heart
in
his
work
and
at
the
end
of
the
third
volume
he
quietly
withdrew
from
his
editorship
the
three
volumes
of
the
which
bear
his
impress
are
notable
for
their
vigor
of
policy
their
high
ideals
their
unswerving
patriotism
and
their
real
literary
merit
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
a
selection
from
freneau
prose
writings
during
this
critical
era
in
our
history
may
sometime
be
made
nowhere
else
can
we
gain
so
distinct
a
picture
of
the
man
with
his
sanguine
impetuous
temperament
his
proud
spirit
and
his
intense
hatred
of
every
form
of
tyranny
he
wrote
vigorously
not
only
on
british
oppression
but
on
such
topics
as
the
wrongs
of
negro
slavery
cruelty
to
animals
the
wanton
destruction
of
trees
the
evils
of
intemperance
and
the
rights
of
woman
the
epistle
to
sylvius
was
his
valedictory
in
it
he
deplores
the
lack
of
literary
taste
in
america
and
the
sad
fate
which
has
befallen
his
youthful
poetic
dreams
the
age
is
grown
mercantile
and
sejanus
the
mighty
tradesman
sejanus
has
in
house
declared
states
as
yet
can
boast
no
bard
and
all
the
of
our
clime
is
merely
nonsense
fringed
with
rhyme
a
bard
with
more
teutonic
blood
if
he
knew
within
himself
that
he
was
indeed
a
poet
and
the
only
real
poet
of
his
time
would
have
staid
at
his
post
and
made
himself
heard
despite
narrow
criticism
and
mean
abuse
but
freneau
was
too
proud
to
fight
for
recognition
the
people
had
crowned
him
to
be
sure
but
if
the
critics
those
who
should
be
the
real
judges
rejected
him
he
would
strive
no
longer
he
would
leave
the
field
then
sylvius
come
let
you
and
i
on
neptune
aid
once
more
rely
perhaps
the
muse
may
still
impart
the
balm
to
ease
the
aching
heart
though
cold
might
chill
and
storms
dismay
yet
zoilus
will
be
far
away
on
june
freneau
sailed
from
middletown
point
as
master
of
the
brig
bound
for
jamaica
the
voyage
was
indeed
a
memorable
one
on
the
night
of
july
while
off
the
end
of
the
island
the
ship
encountered
a
violent
hurricane
according
to
contemporary
accounts
no
more
than
eight
out
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
sail
of
vessels
in
the
ports
of
kingston
and
port
royal
were
saved
the
survived
the
storm
but
it
was
a
mere
wreck
when
the
next
morning
it
crept
into
kingston
harbor
freneau
remained
in
jamaica
until
september
when
he
left
for
philadelphia
in
the
brig
arriving
november
his
experiences
in
trying
to
fit
out
the
wrecked
are
not
recorded
but
the
one
incident
of
his
poetic
reply
to
the
keeper
of
the
king
water
works
who
had
refused
him
a
puncheon
of
water
is
characteristic
from
this
time
until
freneau
life
is
redolent
of
the
ocean
a
complete
itinerary
of
this
wandering
era
may
be
compiled
from
the
shipping
news
of
the
various
seaport
newspapers
but
it
is
useless
to
go
into
details
he
was
master
for
a
time
of
the
sloop
plying
for
freight
between
charleston
new
york
and
savannah
his
brother
peter
in
charleston
had
become
a
man
not
only
of
influence
but
of
means
and
together
they
owned
the
vessel
and
shared
its
profits
for
several
years
advertisements
like
this
appeared
in
the
charleston
papers
for
freight
to
any
part
of
this
state
or
georgia
for
charter
in
any
free
port
in
the
west
indies

freneau
master

particulars
inquire
of
said
master
on
board
at
motte
wharf
or
peter
freneau
on
the
of
june
there
was
issued
from
bailey
press
the
first
collected
edition
of
freneau
poetry
during
the
entire
year
its
author
was
at
sea
almost
continuously
it
is
evident
that
he
had
little
to
do
with
the
edition
the
copy
furnished
to
bailey
consisted
of
the
manuscript
of
a
few
early
poems
revised
copies
of
the
pamphlets
and
corrected
and
enlarged
versions
of
his
contributions
to
the
states
the
bulk
of
the
book
is
made
up
of
contributions
to
the
printed
and
without
change
the
poem
rivington
confessions
is
even
divided
into
two
parts
with
another
poem
between
as
it
first
appeared
in
the
paper
an
index
of
the
poetry
in
the
first
four
volumes
of
the
is
a
nearly
perfect
index
of
the
edition
after
the
poem
the
prison
ship
bailey
wrote
for
the
edition
the
following
introduction
the
pieces
now
collected
and
printed
in
the
following
sheets
were
left
in
my
hands
by
the
author
above
a
year
ago
with
permission
to
publish
them
whenever
i
thought
proper
a
considerable
number
of
the
performances
contained
in
this
volume
as
many
will
recollect
have
appeared
at
different
times
in
newspapers
particularly
the
freeman
journal
and
other
periodical
publications
in
the
different
states
of
america
during
the
late
war
and
since
and
from
the
avidity
and
pleasure
with
which
they
generally
appear
to
have
been
read
by
persons
of
the
best
taste
the
printer
now
the
more
readily
gives
them
to
the
world
in
their
present
form
without
troubling
the
reader
with
any
affected
apologies
for
their
supposed
or
real
imperfections
in
hopes
they
will
afford
a
high
degree
of
satisfaction
to
the
lovers
of
poetical
wit
and
elegance
of
expression
this
edition
is
the
most
spontaneous
and
poetic
of
the
poet
works
in
it
we
see
freneau
before
he
has
lost
his
early
poetic
dream
before
he
has
become
hardened
by
close
contact
with
the
world
of
affairs
and
the
cold
practical
round
of
political
life
this
and
the
edition
contain
by
far
the
most
valuable
part
of
his
poetic
work
in
those
days
before
the
invention
of
book
reviews
the
fate
of
a
book
turned
largely
upon
its
immediate
reception
by
the
reading
public
criticism
was
by
word
of
mouth
the
poems
were
discussed
in
polite
circles
and
over
the
morning
coffee
thus
we
have
nothing
to
quote
to
show
how
america
received
her
bard
we
know
however
that
the
poems
were
successful
even
beyond
bailey
expectations
in
less
than
five
months
he
was
out
with
proposals
for
an
additional
collection
of
entertaining
original
performances
in
prose
and
verse
by
philip
freneau
the
book
was
to
be
published
as
soon
as
five
hundred
subscribers
could
be
secured
and
the
subscribers
names
were
to
be
printed
at
the
beginning
of
the
volume
such
persons
as
are
disposed
to
encourage
american
authors
particularly
at
a
time
when
we
are
surfeited
with
stale
publications
retailed
to
us
from
british
presses
and
are
not
unwilling
to
be
known
as
promoters
of
polite
literature
and
the
fine
arts
in
these
republican
states
are
requested
to
deliver
in
their
names
one
bit
of
contemporary
praise

been
preserved

the
second
volume
of

did
not
appear
promptly
one
year
after
the
first
proposals
bailey
advertised
that
the
book
was
at
last
in
press
an
unusual
hurry
of
other
business
of
a
nature
not
to
be
postponed
has
unavoidably
delayed
the
printer
in
its
publication
to
so
late
a
period
it
is
notable
that
of
the
four
hundred
and
subscribers
two
hundred
and
fifty
or
over
half
were
in
charleston
and
one
hundred
and
in

for
very
few
of
the
volumes
the

advertisement
was
as
follows
the
following
essays
and
poems
selected
from
some
printed
and
manuscript
papers
of
freneau
are
now
presented
to
the
public
of
the
united
slates
in
hopes
they
will
prove
at
least
equally
acceptable
with
his
volume
of
poems
published
last
year
some
few
of
the
pieces
in
this
volume
have
heretofore
appeared
in
american
newspapers
but
through
a
fatality
not
unusually
attending
publications
of
that
kind
are
now
perhaps
forgotten
and
at
any
time
may
possibly
never
have
been
seen
or
attended
to
but
by
very
few
of
the
poems
in
the
volume
one
slender
journey
had
been
published
separately
by
bailey
early
in
and
nearly
half
of
the
others
had
first
seen
the
light
between
april
and
january
in
the
columns
of
the
the
greater
number
of
the
others
were
doubtless
printed
from
the
poet
manuscripts
a
few
of
the
prose
papers
like
the
philosopher
of
the
forest
were
selected
from
the
columns
of
the
especially
from
the
series
entitled
the
pilgrim
but
much
of
the
rest
was
from
the
poet
manuscripts
now
first
published
in
the
meantime
the
poet
was
leading
a
stormy
and
adventurous
career
upon
the
sea
as
master
of
the
sloop
and
later
of
the
schooner
plying
irregularly
on
all
kinds
of
coastwise
voyages
between
georgia
and
new
york
he
experienced
every
phase
of
life
upon
the
ocean
as
a
sample
of
his
adventurous
career
during
this
period
note
the
following
letter
to
bailey
written
from
norfolk
in
the
summer
of
virginia
august
bailey
i
have
the
mortification
to
inform
you
that
after
leaving
on
the
of
july
i
had
the
misfortune
to
have
my
vessel
dismasted
thrown
on
her
beam
ends
shifted
and
ruined
the
bulk
of
her
cargo
lost
every
sail
mast
spar
boat
and
almost
every
article
upon
deck
on
the
wednesday
afternoon
following
in
one
of
the
hardest
gales
that
ever
blew
upon
this
coast
capt
william
cannon
whom
i
think
you
know
who
was
going
passenger
with
me
to
charleston
and
joseph
stillwell
a
lad
of
a
reputable
family
in
were
both
washed
overboard
and
drowned
notwithstanding
every
effort
to
save
them
all
my
people
besides
except
one
an
old
man
who
stuck
fast
in
one
of
the
scuttles
were
several
times
overboard
but
had
the
fortune
to
regain
the
wreck
and
with
considerable
difficulty
save
their
as
to
myself
i
found
the
vessel
no
longer
under
any
guidance
i
took
refuge
in
the
main
weather
shrouds
where
indeed
i
saved
myself
from
being
washed
into
the
sea
but
was
almost
staved
to
pieces
in
a
violent
fall
i
had
upon
the
main
deck
the
having
given
way
six
feet
above
the
deck
and
gone
overboard
i
was
afterward
knocked
in
the
head
by
a
violent
stroke
of
the
tiller
which
entirely
deprived
me
of
sensation
for
i
was
told
near
a
quarter
of
an
our
pumps
were
now
so
choaked
with
corn
that
they
would
no
longer
work
upward
of
four
feet
of
water
was
in
the
hold
fortunately
our
bucket
was
saved
and
with
this
we
went
to
baling
which
alone
prevented
us
from
foundering
in
one
of
the
most
dismal
nights
that
ever
man
witnessed
the
next
morning
the
weather
had
cleared
away
and
the
wind
came
round
to
the
which
during
the
gale
had
been
the
land
was
then
in
sight
about
miles
distant
latitude
at
noon
i
then
rigged
out
a
broken
boom
and
set
the
fore
the
only
sail
remaining
and
steered
for
cape
henry
making
however
but
very
little
way
the
vessel
being
very
much
on
one
side
and
ready
to
sink
with
her
heavy
cargo
of
iron
besides
other
weighty
articles
we
were
towed
in
next
day
friday
by
the
friendly
assistance
of
capt
archibald
bell
of
the
ship
betsey
from
london
i
have
since
arrived
at
this
port
by
the
assistance
of
a
potowmac
nothing
could
exceed
our
distress
no
fire
no
candle
our
beds
soaked
with
sea
water
the
cabbin
torn
to
pieces
a
vast
quantity
of
corn
damaged
and
poisoning
us
to
death
as
we
entered
this
port
on
the
of
july
the
very
dogs
looked
at
us
with
an
eye
of
commiseration
the
negros
pitied
us
and
almost
every
one
shewed
a
disposition
to
relieve
us
in
the
midst
of
all
this
vexation
the
crew
endeavoured
to
keep
up
their
spirits
with
a
little
grog
while
i
have
recourse
to
my
old
expedient
of
philosophy
and
reflection
i
have
unloaded
my
cargo
partly
damaged
partly
otherwise
this
day
i
also
begin
to
refit
my
vessel
and
mean
to
proceed
back
to
as
soon
as
refitted
which
can
not
be
sooner
than
the
perhaps
the
of
this
month
it
is
possible
however
that
i
may
be
ordered
to
sell
the
vessel
here
if
so
i
shall
take
a
passage
to
baltimore
and
go
to
by
the
way
of
philadelphia
to
look
out
for
another
more
fortunate
barque
than
that
which
i
now
command
your
philip
freneau
i
can
not
forbear
quoting
another
letter
written
nearly
a
year
later
since
it
gives
us
a
charming
glimpse
of
the
freneau
of
this
period
yamacraw
savanna
march
sir
amongst
a
number
of
my
good
natured
acquaintance
who
have
lately
sympathized
with
me
on
account
of
what
they
term
my
misfortunes
during
great
part
of
last
year
i
know
of
no
one
more
entitled
to
my
acknowledgments
on
the
occasion
than
yourself
when
an
old
woman
talks
of
witches
ghosts
or
blue
devils
we
naturally
make
an
allowance
for
bad
education
or
the
imbicility
of
intellect
occasioned
by
age
when
one
man
seriously
supposes
another
unfortunate
for
the
sake
of
two
or
three
successive
disasters
which
no
prudence
or
foresight
could
have
avoided
the
same
allowance
ought
to
be
made
provided
the
same
excuses
could
be
assigned
can
you
be
serious
then
in
advising
me
to
quit
all
future
intercourse
with
an
element
that
has
for
some
years
with
all
its
dangers
and
losses
afforded
to
your
humble
servant
attractions
far
more
powerful
than
those
of
apollo
formerly
when
i
wrote
poetry
most
of
those
that
attended
to
it
would
not
allow
my
verses
to
be
good
i
gave
credit
to
what
i
deemed
the
popular
opinion
and
made
a
safe
retreat
in
due
time
to
the
solitary
wastes
of
neptune
i
am
not
however
inclined
to
believe
people
so
readily
now
when
they
alledge
my
vessel
is
not
sound
and
when
several
gentlemen
for
reasons
best
known
to
themselves
and
perhaps
not
over
willing
to
risque
the
uncertainties
of
the
world
to
come
effect
to
doubt
of
her
ability
to
waft
their
carcases
in
safety
but
my
ambition
is
greatly
concerned
in
this
matter
a
schooner
is
confided
to
my
care
humble
indeed
when
compared
to
those
lofty
piles
which
i
have
seen
you
so
much
admire
but
which
is
nevertheless
really
capable
of
an
european
nay
of
an
india
voyage
read
all
history
ransack
libraries
call
tradition
to
your
aid
search
all
records
examine
a
million
of
manuscripts
on
vellum
on
parchment
on
paper
on
marble
on
what
you
please
and
i
defy
you
to
find
the
most
distant
hint
of
any
in
any
age
or
country
from
hesiod
down
to
peter
pindar
having
been
trusted
with
the
controul
or
possession
of
anything
fit
to
be
mentioned
or
compared
with
the
same
barque
which
you
say
have
the
misfortune
to
to
be
serious
misfortune
ought
to
be
only
the
topic
of
such
men
as
do
not
think
or
reason
with
propriety
upon
the
nature
of
things
some
writer
says
it
is
but
another
name
for
carelessness
or
inattention
though
that
may
not
at
all
times
be
the
case
it
is
in
the
power
of
every
man
to
place
himself
beyond
the
supposed
baneful
influence
of
this
inexorable
deity
by
a
dignity
of
mind
if
it
be
not
the
gift
of
nature
that
will
in
the
end
get
the
better
of
the
untoward
events
that
may
frequently
cross
our
best
purposes
indeed
the
is
the
school
for
philosophy
i
mean
of
the
moral
kind
in
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
acquaintance
with
this
element
i
am
convinced
a
man
ought
to
imbibe
more
of
your
right
genuine
stuff
than
could
be
gained
in
half
a
century
on
i
must
add
that
be
our
occupations
what
they
may
or
our
fortunes
what
they
will
there
is
a
certain
delectable
inexpressible
satisfaction
in
now
and
then
encountering
the
rubs
and
disasters
of
life
and
i
am
entirely
of
the
opinion
which
says
langhorne
weakness
wrote
in
petrarch
gentle
strain
when
once
he
own
at
love
unfavouring
shrine
thousand
pleasures
art
not
worth
one
i
must
now
conclude
this
scrawl
with
telling
you
that
i
am
receiving
on
board
my
vessel
a
small
cargo
of
lumber
at
a
place
called
yamacraw
a
little
above
savanna
the
weather
is
extremely
warm
i
am
tired
of
my
letter
and
must
of
course
conclude
i
do
not
know
whether
you
ever
mean
to
make
a
voyage
to
sea
if
you
should
thrice
welcome
shall
you
be
to
such
accommodations
as
my
little
embarkation
affords
poets
and
philosophers
shall
ever
travel
with
me
at
a
cheap
rate
indeed
not
only
because
they
are
not
generally
men
of
this
world
but
because
even
supposing
the
barque
that
bears
them
should
make
an
external
exit
to
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
the
busy
world
as
things
go
will
regret
the
loss
of
most
of
them
very
little
perhaps
not
at
all
your
p

the
of
april
when

daily
for
several
months
negotiations
had
been
pending
every
appearance

a
year

marked
by
a
small
budget
of
poems

from

but
it
was
not
until
february
that
he
was
induced
to
leave
his
beloved
and
settle
down
to
a
life
upon

the
poem

some
months
later

following
on

of

at

capt

to
miss
eleanor
forman
daughter
of
samuel
forman
of
that
place
the
forman
family
with
which
the
poet
allied
himself
was
one
of
great
respectability
and
even
prominence
in
new
jersey
its
record
during
the
revolution
had
been
a
conspicuous
one
and
its
connection
included
the
ledyards
the
seymours
and
many
other
prominent
families
freneau
in
the
words
of
her
daughter
was
remarkable
for
her
gentle
manners
amiable
disposition
and
finely
informed
mind
she
was
affable
and
sprightly
in
her
conversation
and
there
were
even
when
she
had
reached
the
advanced
age
of
few
handsomer
women
in
her
early
years
she
dabbled
a
little
in
poetry
herself
and
there
is
a
tradition
in
the
family
that
the
prenuptial
correspondence
was
for
a
long
time
wholly
in
verse
freneau
was
now
fairly
settled
in
life
and
for
the
next
seven
or
eight
years
he
was
engaged
almost
continuously
in
newspaper
work
during
the
next
year
and
more
freneau
as
editor
of
the
brought
to
bear
upon
the
paper
all
the
vigor
and
literary
skill
which
had
so
marked
the
the
tone
of
the
editorial
comment
was
patriotic
and
spirited
the
note
of
reform
of
opposition
to
everything
that
was
degrading
to
high
ideals
or
that
in
any
way
threatened
personal
liberty
was
never
absent
despite
the
manifold
duties
incumbent
upon
the
editor
of
a
city
daily
he
found
time
to
write
finished
prose
sketches
and
to
woo
the
muses
his
poetry
of
this
period
is
notable
both
as
to
quantity
and
quality
some
of
it
was
drawn
from
the
notebooks
of
his
years
of
wandering
but
the
greater
part
dealt
with
more
timely
topics
in
june
he
published
the
advertisement
freneau
proposes
publishing
a
volume
of
original
poems
to
contain
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
pages
neatly
printed
as
soon
as
there
appears
a
sufficiency
of
subscribers
to
defray
the
expenses
of
paper
and
printing
the
collection
shall
be
put
to
press
judging
from
several
poems
of
this
period
which
were
printed
as
from
the
author
new
volume
the
rising
empire
this
was
to
be
the
title
of
the
book
the
advertisement
was
dropped
in
october
and
the
rising
empire
never
appeared
though
most
of
its
poems
were
printed
in
the
edition
of
on

freneau
daughter
eleanor
was
born
at
mount
pleasant
his
salary
as
editor
of
the
was
not
large
the
little
family
it
appears
was
in
straightened
circumstances
a
letter
from
aedanus
burke
of
charleston
to
madison
dated
september
throws
light
upon
the
period
i
remember
it
was
about
the
last
fortnight
that
we
served
together
in
congress
in
i
one
day
called
you
aside
and
mentioned
the
name
of
phillip
freneau
to
you
as
one
i
knew
you
esteemed
and
then
lay
strugling
under
difficulties
with
his
family
my
memory
brings
to
my
recollection
that
you
mentioned
the
matter
to
the
secretary
of
state
jefferson
freneau
was
invited
from
york
and
had
the
place
of
interpreter
with
a
mere
trifle
of
salary
little
did
william
smith
know
that
you
were
the
author
or
cause
of
bringing
freneau
from
new
york
or
he
might
have
turned
against
you
his
terrible
battery
of
the
slanders
and
invectives
which
he
poured
forth
against
jefferson
for
three
or
four
years
afterwards
madison
acted
promptly
on
the
of
february
jefferson
wrote
to
freneau
as
follows
sir
the
clerkship
for
foreign
languages
in
my
office
is
vacant
the
salary
indeed
is
very
low
being
but
two
hundred
fifty
dollars
a
year
but
also
it
gives
so
little
to
do
as
not
to
interfere
with
any
other
calling
the
person
may
chuse
which
would
not
absent
him
from
the
seat
of
government
i
was
told
a
few
days
ago
that
it
might
perhaps
be
convenient
to
you
to
accept
it
if
so
it
is
at
your
service
it
requires
no
other
qualification
than
a
moderate
knowledge
of
the
french
should
anything
better
turn
up
within
my
department
that
might
suit
you
i
should
be
very
happy
to
bestow
it
as
well
should
you
conclude
to
accept
the
present
you
may
consider
it
as
engaged
to
you
only
be
so
good
as
to
drop
me
a
line
informing
me
of
your
resolution
i
am
with
great
esteem
sir
your
very
humble
th
jefferson
freneau
letter
in
reply
has
been
lost
on
may
however
madison
wrote
jefferson
so
that
we
may
gather
its
import
i
have
seen
freneau
also
and
given
him
a
line
to
you
he
sets
out
for
philada
today
or
tomorrow
though
it
is
not
improbable
that
he
may
halt
in
jersey
he
is
in
the
habit
i
find
of
translating
the
leyden
and
consequently
must
be
fully
equal
to
the
task
you
have
alloted
for
him
he
had
supposed
that
besides
this
degree
of
skill
it
might
be
expected
that
he
should
be
able
to
translate
with
equal
propriety
into
french
and
under
this
idea
his
delicacy
had
taken
an
insuperable
objection
to
the
undertaking
being
now
set
right
as
to
this
particular
and
being
made
sensible
of
the
advantages
of
philada
over
jersey
for
his
private
undertaking
his
mind
is
taking
another
turn
and
if
the
scantiness
of
his
capital
should
not
be
a
bar
i
think
he
will
establish
himself
in
the
former
at
all
events
he
will
give
his
friends
there
an
opportunity
of
aiding
his
decision
by
their
information
counsel
the
more
i
learn
of
his
character
talents
and
principles
the
more
i
should
regret
his
burying
himself
in
the
obscurity
he
had
chosen
in
jersey
it
is
certain
that
there
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
whole
catalogue
of
american
printers
a
single
name
that
can
approach
towards
a
rivalship
jefferson
replied
on
may
your
favor
of
the
came
to
hand
on
the
freneau
has
not
followed
it
i
suppose
therefore
he
has
changed
his
mind
back
again
for
which
i
am
really
sorry
that
jefferson
had
made
overtures
to
freneau
about
the
establishing
of
a
paper
at
the
seat
of
government
or
at
least
had
discussed
the
matter
with
those
who
had
is
evident
from
the
following
letter
written
to
his
randolph
six
days
later
i
enclose
you
bache
as
well
as
fenno
papers
you
will
have
perceived
that
the
latter
is
a
paper
of
pure
toryism
disseminating
the
doctrines
of
monarchy
aristocracy
the
exclusion
of
the
people
we
have
been
trying
to
get
another
or
set
up
excluding
advertisements
so
that
it
might
go
through
the
states
furnish
a
of
intelligence
we
hoped
at
one
time
to
have
persuaded
freneau
to
set
up
here
but
failed
it
is
a
testimonial
to
the
energy
and
the
ability
of
freneau
that
leaders
like
madison
and
jefferson
should
have
sought
him
so
persistently
notwithstanding
freneau
refusal
jefferson
on
july
wrote
to
madison
i
am
sincerely
sorry
that
freneau
has
declined
coming
here
the
printing
business
be
sufficiently
full
here
yet
i
think
he
would
have
set
out
on
such
advantageous
ground
as
to
have
been
sure
of
success
his
own
genius
in
the
first
place
is
so
superior
to
that
of
his
competitors
i
should
have
given
him
the
perusal
of
all
my
letters
of
foreign
intelligence
all
foreign
newspapers
the
publication
of
all
proclamations
other
public
notices
within
my
department
the
printing
of
the
laws
which
added
to
his
salary
would
have
been
a
considerable
aid
besides
this
being
the
only
weekly
or
half
weekly
paper
under
general
condemnation
for
its
toryism
its
incessant
efforts
to
overturn
the
government
freneau
would
have
found
that
ground
as
good
as
unoccupied
this
being
brought
to
freneau
attention
he
determined
to
hold
out
no
longer
on
july
he
wrote
to
madison
from
middletown
point
some
business
detains
me
here
a
day
or
two
longer
from
returning
to
new
york
when
i
come
which
i
expect
will
be
on
thursday
if
you
should
not
have
left
the
city
i
will
give
you
a
decisive
answer
relative
to
printing
my
paper
at
the
seat
of
govt
instead
of
in
york
if
i
can
get
childs
to
be
connected
with
me
on
a
tolerable
plan
i
believe
i
shall
sacrifice
other
considerations
and
transfer
myself
to
philadelphia
francis
childs
who
was
one
of
the
proprietors
of
the
as
we
have
already
seen
agreed
to
the
enterprise
and
the
following
document
was
soon
signed
department
of
state
of
the
united
states
philip
freneau
is
hereby
appointed
clerk
for
foreign
languages
in
the
office
of
secretary
of
state
with
a
salary
of
two
hundred
fifty
dollars
a
year
to
commence
from
the
time
he
shall
take
the
requisite
oaths
of
qualification
given
under
my
hand
and
seal
this
day
of
august
th
jefferson
i
have
considered
this
episode
somewhat
minutely
since
it
throws
light
upon
what
follows
the
first
number
of
national
appeared
on
monday
october
it
was
issued
mondays
and
thursdays
its
typography
and
arrangement
were
neat
and
attractive
its
news
columns
were
well
filled
and
its
literary
department
was
carefully
attended
to
its
success
was
all
that
had
been
predicted
by
madison
on
may
the
editor
announced
that
the
subscription
to
the
had
succeeded
beyond
his
most
sanguine
expectations
the
period
covered
by
the
two
years
of
the
was
one
of
singular
unrest
in
america
the
french
revolution
was
in
progress
everything
seemed
tottering
america
believed
that
all
europe
was
soon
to
cast
off
its
chains
of
monarch
she
believed
that
the
torch
of
the
rights
of
man
had
been
lighted
in
america
and
she
looked
with
almost
paternal
interest
on
the
progress
of
the
revolution
in
his
poetical
salutatory
in
the
first
number
of
the
freneau
writes
from
the
spark
that
we
kindled
a
flame
has
gone
forth
to
astonish
the
world
and
enlighten
mankind
with
a
code
of
new
doctrines
the
universe
rings
and
paine
is
addressing
strange
sermons
to
kings
the
columns
of
the
are
full
of
ringing
words
on
the
rights
of
man
the
age
of
reason
the
final
doom
of
monarchy
in
poem
after
poem
the
editor
pours
out
his
sympathy
for
republicanism
and
the
cause
of
the
french
insurgents
that
the
french
had
been
largely
instrumental
in
the
gaining
of
our
own
independence
increased
the
interest
on
the
fourteenth
of
july
on
the
french
republicans
on
the
anniversary
of
the
storming
of
the
bastile
ode
to
liberty
and
demolition
of
the
french
monarchy
are
a
few
of
the
poems
that
freneau
poured
forth
during
this
incendiary
period
it
is
significant
that
he
included
none
of
these
verses
in
his
edition
of
that
he
was
honest
to
the
core
in
his
belief
can
not
for
a
moment
be
doubted
his
impulsive
celtic
temperament
threw
his
whole
soul
into
his
work
ah
while
i
write
dear
france
allied
my
ardent
wish
i
scarce
restrain
to
throw
these
sybil
leaves
aside
and
fly
to
join
you
on
the
main
the
frenzy
among
the
american
republicans
culminated
with
the
arrival
of
citizen
genet
in
at
the
republican
dinner
given
genet
may
citizen
freneau
was
elected
by
acclamation
to
translate
pichon
ode
on
june
at
the
civic
feast
freneau
ode
god
save
the
rights
of
man
was
received
with
thunderous
applause
one
must
study
carefully
this
incendiary
period
of
freneau
life
before
he
can
understand
fully
the
much
discussed
episode
of
the
the
wine
of
french
republicanism
was
sadly
intoxicating
it
could
make
freneau
write
such
a
stanza
as
this
order
and
haste
and
seek
some
other
region
your
plan
is
fixed
to
hunt
them
down
destroy
the
mitre
rend
the
gown
and
that
vile
philosophy
restore
did
ever
paper
plan
so
much
before
and
then
explain
it
by
saying
that
national
is
the
vehicle
of
party
spleen
and
opposition
to
the
great
principles
of
order
virtue
and
religion
in
view
of
all
this
it
is
not
strange
that
he
should
have
been
impatient
with
the
conservative
party
who
not
only
did
not
grow
enthusiastic
over
the
french
revolution
but
even
looked
upon
it
with
actual
disapprobation
from
the
very
first
the
editor
of
the
criticised
the
leading
federalists
especially
adams
and
hamilton
and
he
even
mildly
rebuked
washington
the
hero
of
his
earlier
muse
the
administration
in
his
mind
was
leaning
toward
monarchial
ideas
washington
in
his
opinion
had
exceeded
his
power
in
the
matter
of
the
banks
and
the
precedent
was
a
dangerous
one
the
ceremonials
with
which
the
president
had
hedged
himself
about
were
greatly
at
variance
with
simple
democratic
ideas
and
to
crown
all
the
ingratitude
of
the
administration
to
the
extremists
it
could
have
no
other
name
in
its
attitude
toward
genet
and
the
french
people
hurt
him
deeply
i
believe
that
freneau
was
fundamentally
honest
in
his
position
it
is
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
a
note
like
this
in
the
of
is
not
sincere
the
conduct
of
the
federal
executive
of
this
country
toward
the
republic
of
france
so
far
as
it
may
appear
inimical
has
given
great
and
general
disgust
to
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
it
would
be
well
if
some
that
might
be
mentioned
would
recollect
the
nation
that
supported
us
in
the
late
war
when
our
infant
republic
was
on
the
point
of
annihilation
enmity
to
france
is
treason
against
republicanism
in
regard
to
adams
who
had
danced
at
the
king
ball
in
a
scarlet
suit
and
hamilton
the
father
of
the
federalists
freneau
had
no
scruples
the
attacks
of
the
became
more
and
more
pointed
with
every
issue
though
much
of
the
more
incendiary
matter
was
not
from
pen
the
probationary
odes
for
instance
attributed
to
him
by
contemporary
enemies
and
in
later
years
quoted
by
buckingham
and
duyckinck
as
from
his
pen
were
written
by
george
tucker
they
were
published
in
book
form
by
tucker
in
in
the
sensitive
state
of
party
politics
at
this
time
such
frank
criticism
could
not
fail
to
raise
a
tempest
of
rebuttal
and
of
counter
abuse
it
was
soon
noted
that
the
in
its
attacks
upon
the
administration
spared
the
state
department
jefferson
was
never
mentioned
except
for
praise
the
inference
was
obvious
either
he
had
muzzled
the
paper
by
granting
it
certain
favors
or
he
was
making
use
of
it
as
a
weapon
against
the
very
administration
of
which
he
was
a
member
hamilton
naturally
inclined
toward
the
latter
view
and
much
bitterness
was
the
result
on
july
he
inserted
this
anonymous
bit
in
gazette
of
the
united
the
federalist
organ
the
editor
of
the
receives
a
salary
from
government
quere
whether
this
salary
is
paid
him
for
or
for
the
design
for
which
is
to
vilify
those
to
whom
the
voice
of
the
people
has
committed
the
administration
of
our
public
affairs
to
oppose
the
measures
of
government
and
by
false
insinuations
to
disturb
the
public
peace
in
common
life
it
is
thought
ungrateful
for
a
man
to
bite
the
hand
that
puts
bread
in
his
mouth
but
if
the
man
is
hired
to
do
it
the
case
is
altered
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
series
of
anonymous
attacks
in
the
federalist
newspaper
written
undoubtedly
by
hamilton
a
second
article
still
more
definite
appeared
on
august
in
it
the
writer
directly
charged
jefferson
with
being
the
soul
and
spirit
of
the
freneau
was
thought
a
fit
instrument
and
so
was
deliberately
engaged
he
was
simply
the
faithful
and
devoted
servant
of
the
head
of
a
party
from
whose
hands
he
received
a
boon
the
article
then
proceeds
at
length
to
arraign
jefferson
and
to
appeal
to
the
american
people
whether
they
will
consent
to
see
the
precious
legacies
which
are
theirs
frittered
away
in
so
shameless
a
manner
this
attack
called
forth
from
freneau
an
affidavit
which
was
printed
in
the
august
personally
appeared
before
me
matthew
clarkson
mayor
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
philip
freneau
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
who
being
duly
sworn
doth
depose
and
say
that
no
negociation
was
ever
opened
with
him
by
thomas
jefferson
secretary
of
state
for
the
establishment
or
institution
of
the
that
the
deponent
coming
to
the
city
of
philadelphia
as
publisher
of
a
newspaper
was
at
no
time
urged
advised
or
influenced
by
the
above
officer
but
that
it
was
his
own
voluntary
act
and
that
the
said
gazette
nor
the
editor
thereof
was
ever
directed
controuled
or
attempted
to
be
influenced
in
any
manner
either
by
the
secretary
of
state
or
any
of
his
friends
nor
was
a
line
ever
directly
or
indirectly
written
dictated
or
composed
for
it
by
that
officer
but
that
the
editor
has
consulted
his
own
judgment
alone
in
the
conducting
of
it
free
unfettered
and
uninfluenced
philip
freneau
sworn
the
august
before
matthew
clarkson
mayor
hamilton
followed
august
with
another
article
he
emphatically
discredited
freneau
oath
declaring
that
facts
spoke
louder
than
words
and
under
certain
circumstances
louder
than
oaths
that
the
editor
of
the
must
not
think
to
swear
away
their
efficacy
that
if
he
was
truly
as
they
announced
the
pensioned
tool
of
the
public
character
who
had
been
named
no
violation
of
truth
in
any
shape
ought
to
astonish
equivocations
and
mental
reservations
were
the
too
common
refuge
of
minds
struggling
to
escape
from
disgraceful
imputations
the
article
then
proceeded
to
show
that
jefferson
did
really
establish
the
through
a
particular
friend
freneau
at
once
declined
to
answer
further
the
attacks
on
the
ground
that
they
were
mere
personal
charges
and
hamilton
promptly
branded
this
as
a
mere
subterfuge
thus
freneau
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
a
perfect
hornet
nest
of
partisan
strife
that
involved
the
country
from
end
to
end
the
federal
organ
continued
its
attacks
and
freneau
always
restive
under
criticism
increased
in
bitterness
on
september
jefferson
put
himself
on
record
in
a
letter
to
washington
the
letter
is
extremely
long
since
it
covers
the
entire
contest
with
hamilton
from
the
beginning
in
it
he
declared
while
the
government
was
at
new
york
i
was
applied
to
on
behalf
of
freneau
to
know
if
there
was
any
place
within
my
department
to
which
he
could
be
appointed
i
answered
there
were
but
four
clerkships
all
of
which
i
found
full
and
continued
without
any
change
when
we
removed
to
philadelphia
pintard
the
translating
clerk
did
not
choose
to
remove
with
us
his
office
then
became
vacant
i
was
again
applied
to
there
for
freneau
and
had
no
hesitation
to
promise
the
clerkship
for
him
i
can
not
recollect
whether
it
was
at
the
same
time
or
afterwards
that
i
was
told
he
had
a
thought
of
setting
up
a
newspaper
there
but
whether
then
or
afterwards
i
considered
it
a
circumstance
of
some
value
as
it
might
enable
me
to
do
what
i
had
long
wished
to
have
done
that
is
to
have
the
material
parts
of
the
leyden
gazette
brought
under
your
eye
and
that
of
the
public
in
order
to
possess
yourself
and
them
of
a
juster
view
of
the
affairs
of
europe
than
could
be
obtained
from
any
other
public
source
this
i
had
ineffectually
attempted
through
the
press
of
fenno
while
in
new
york
selecting
and
translating
passages
myself
at
first
then
having
it
done
by
pintard
the
translating
clerk
but
they
found
their
way
too
slowly
into
fenno
papers
bache
essayed
it
for
me
in
philadelphia
but
his
being
a
daily
paper
did
not
circulate
sufficiently
in
the
other
states
he
even
tried
at
my
request
the
plan
of
a
weekly
paper
of
recapitulation
from
his
daily
paper
in
hopes
that
that
might
go
into
the
other
states
but
in
this
too
we
failed
freneau
as
translating
clerk
and
the
printer
of
a
periodical
paper
likely
to
circulate
through
the
states
uniting
in
one
person
the
parts
of
pintard
and
fenno
revived
my
hopes
that
the
thing
could
at
length
be
effected
on
the
establishment
of
his
paper
therefore
i
furnished
him
with
the
leyden
gazettes
with
an
expression
of
my
wish
that
he
could
always
translate
and
publish
the
material
intelligence
they
contained
and
have
continued
to
furnish
them
from
time
to
time
as
regularly
as
i
received
them
but
as
to
any
other
direction
or
indication
of
my
wish
how
his
press
should
be
conducted
what
sort
of
intelligence
he
should
give
what
essays
encourage
i
can
protest
in
the
presence
of
heaven
that
i
never
did
by
myself
or
any
other
or
indirectly
say
a
syllable
nor
attempt
any
kind
of
influence
i
can
further
protest
in
the
same
awful
presence
that
i
never
did
by
myself
or
any
other
directly
or
indirectly
write
dictate
or
procure
any
one
sentence
or
sentiment
to
be
inserted
any
other
to
which
my
name
was
not
affixed
or
that
of
my
office
freneau
proposition
to
publish
a
paper
having
been
about
the
time
that
the
writings
of
publicola
and
the
discourses
on
davila
had
a
good
deal
excited
the
public
attention
i
took
for
granted
from
freneau
character
which
had
been
marked
as
that
of
a
good
whig
that
he
would
give
free
place
to
pieces
written
against
the
aristocratical
and
monarchial
principles
these
papers
had
inculcated
this
having
been
in
my
mind
it
is
likely
enough
i
may
have
expressed
it
in
conversation
with
others
though
i
do
not
recollect
that
i
did
to
freneau
i
think
i
could
not
because
i
had
still
seen
him
but
once
and
that
at
a
public
table
at
breakfast
at
elsworth
as
i
passed
through
new
york
the
last
year
and
i
can
safely
declare
that
my
expectations
looked
only
to
the
chastisement
of
the
aristocratical
and
monarchial
writers
and
not
to
any
criticisms
on
the
proceedings
of
government
colonel
hamilton
can
see
no
motive
for
any
appointment
but
that
of
making
a
convenient
partisan
but
you
sir
who
have
received
from
me
recommendations
of
a
rittenhouse
barlow
paine
will
believe
that
talents
and
science
are
sufficient
motives
with
me
in
appointments
to
which
they
are
fitted
and
that
freneau
as
a
man
of
genius
might
find
a
preference
in
my
eye
to
be
a
translating
clerk
and
make
good
title
to
the
little
aids
i
could
give
him
as
the
editor
of
a
gazette
by
procuring
subscriptions
to
his
paper
as
i
did
some
before
it
appeared
and
as
i
have
with
pleasure
done
for
the
labors
of
other
men
of
genius
i
hold
it
to
be
one
of
the
distinguishing
excellences
of
elective
over
hereditary
successions
that
the
talents
which
nature
has
provided
in
sufficient
proportion
should
be
selected
by
the
society
for
the
government
of
their
affairs
rather
than
this
should
be
transmitted
through
the
loins
of
knaves
and
fools
passing
from
the
debauches
of
the
table
to
those
of
the
bed
colonel
hamilton
alias
facts
says
that
freneau
salary
began
before
he
resided
in
philadelphia
i
do
not
know
what
quibble
he
may
have
in
reserve
on
the
word
he
may
mean
to
include
under
that
idea
the
removal
of
his
family
for
i
believe
he
removed
himself
before
his
family
did
to
philadelphia
but
no
act
of
mine
gave
commencement
to
his
salary
before
he
so
far
took
up
his
abode
in
philadelphia
as
to
be
sufficiently
in
readiness
for
the
duties
of
the
office
as
to
the
merits
or
demerits
of
his
paper
they
certainly
concern
me
not
he
and
fenno
are
rivals
for
the
public
favor
the
one
courts
them
by
flattery
the
other
by
censure
and
i
believe
it
will
be
admitted
that
the
one
has
been
as
servile
as
the
other
severe
but
is
not
the
dignity
and
even
decency
of
government
committed
when
one
of
its
principal
ministers
enlists
himself
as
an
anonymous
writer
or
paragraphist
for
either
the
one
or
the
other
of
them
no
government
ought
to
be
without
censors
and
where
the
press
is
free
no
one
ever
will
if
virtuous
it
need
not
fear
the
fair
operation
of
attack
and
defence
nature
has
given
to
man
no
other
means
of
sifting
out
the
truth
either
in
religion
law
or
politics
i
think
it
as
honorable
to
the
government
neither
to
know
nor
notice
its
sycophants
or
censors
as
it
would
be
undignified
and
criminal
to
pamper
the
former
and
persecute
the
latter
but
if
the
concerned
jefferson
not
at
all
as
he
alleged
it
certainly
did
exasperate
washington
later
on
when
the
genet
affair
had
urged
freneau
into
still
greater
excesses
washington
on
the
of
may
had
a
conversation
with
jefferson
which
the
latter
recorded
in
his
he
the
president
adverted
to
a
piece
in
freneau
paper
of
yesterday
he
said
he
despised
all
their
attacks
on
him
personally
but
that
there
never
had
been
an
act
of
the
government
not
meaning
in
the
executive
line
only
but
in
any
line
which
that
paper
had
not
abused
he
had
also
marked
the
word
republic
thus
where
it
was
applied
to
the
french
republic
see
the
original
paper
he
was
evidently
sore
warm
and
i
took
his
intention
to
be
that
i
should
interpose
in
some
way
with
freneau
perhaps
withdraw
his
appointment
of
translating
clerk
to
my
office
but
i
will
not
do
it
his
paper
has
saved
our
constitution
which
was
galloping
fast
into
monarchy
has
been
checked
by
no
one
means
so
powerfully
as
by
that
paper
it
is
well
and
universally
known
that
it
has
been
that
paper
which
has
checked
the
career
of
the
monocrats
the
president
not
sensible
of
the
designs
of
the
party
has
not
with
his
usual
good
sense
and
looked
on
the
efforts
and
effects
of
this
free
press
and
seen
that
though
some
bad
things
have
passed
through
it
to
the
public
yet
the
good
have
preponderated
immensely
washington
even
brought
the
affair
into
a
meeting
of
the
cabinet
declaring
according
to
jefferson
that
that
rascal
freneau
sent
him
three
copies
of
his
paper
every
day
as
if
he
thought
he
washington
would
become
the
distributor
of
them
that
he
could
see
in
this
nothing
but
an
impudent
design
to
insult
him
he
ended
in
a
high
tone
the
published
its
last
issue
october
the
collapse
of
the
genet
bubble
the
revulsion
of
feeling
after
the
frenchman
had
threatened
to
appeal
from
washington
to
the
people
brought
on
a
tidal
wave
which
swept
away
all
the
idols
of
french
republicanism
in
america
and
the
could
not
withstand
the
tide
subscribers
withdrew
their
subscriptions
at
a
ruinous
rate
the
notes
of
the
proprietors
were
protested
and
the
paper
was
abandoned
freneau
had
no
idea
however
of
final
surrender
his
last
word
was
a
promise
which
however
was
never
fulfilled
with
the
present
number
concludes
the
second
volume
and
second
year
publication
of
the
having
just
imported
on
his
own
account
a
considerable
quantity
of
new
and
elegant
printing
types
from
europe
it
is
the
editor
intention
to
resume
the
publication
of
this
paper
in
a
short
time
and
previous
to
the
meeting
of
congress
in
december
next
it
is
upon
this
episode
that
the
reputation
of
freneau
among
the
generality
of
people
chiefly
rests
that
rascal
freneau
is
the
epithet
that
has
clung
to
his
name
through
all
the
intervening
century
it
is
this
one
affair
more
than
anything
else
that
has
kept
him
from
the
recognition
he
deserves
both
as
a
patriot
and
a
poet
the
attitude
of
new
england
may
be
expressed
in
the
words
of
president
dwight
written
during
the
summer
of
freneau
your
printer
linguist
is
regarded
here
as
a
mere
incendiary
or
rather
as
a
despicable
tool
of
bigger
incendiaries
and
his
paper
as
a
public
nuisance
letters
might
be
multiplied
in
showing
the
same
spirit
in
all
of
the
federalists
it
must
not
be
forgotten
however
that
freneau
acted
from
pure
and
honest
motives
that
the
excitement
and
bitter
partisanship
of
the
period
were
extraordinary
and
that
the
air
was
heavily
charged
with
the
subtle
magnetism
that
in
france
had
created
a
reign
of
terror
it
can
not
be
denied
that
freneau
went
to
excess
in
his
denunciations
but
so
did
hamilton
who
in
reality
began
the
conflict
so
did
jefferson
so
did
many
others
as
to
the
extent
to
which
jefferson
went
in
subsidizing
the
for
his
own
use
the
reader
may
judge
for
himself
neither
side
is
free
from
blame
freneau
is
certainly
no
more
culpable
than
the
others
who
held
far
higher
positions
than
he
it
is
but
justice
to
say
of
freneau
in
the
words
of
jefferson
biographer
randall
he
was
always
a
warm
and
after
the
period
of
which
we
write
became
a
violent
partisan
it
is
but
justice
to
his
memory
however
to
say
that
his
honor
and
his
veracity
as
a
man
were
never
questioned
by
those
who
knew
him
and
that
his
reputation
in
these
particulars
is
now
as
free
from
all
taint
of
suspicion
as
is
that
of
any
of
the
distinguished
gentlemen
whose
names
were
associated
with
his
in
the
controversy
the
following
words
of
madison
taken
from
trist
memoranda
of
a
conversation
may
and
published
in
tucker
life
of
jefferson
probably
presents
the
affair
in
its
true
light
madison
said
paper
was
another
cause
of
soreness
in
general
washington
among
its
different
contributors
some
were
actuated
by
zeal
and
some
perhaps
by
malignity
every
effort
was
made
in
fenno
paper
and
by
those
immediately
around
him
washington
to
impress
on
his
mind
a
belief
that
this
paper
had
been
got
up
by
jefferson
to
injure
him
and
oppose
the
measures
of
his
administration
freneau
himself
was
an
old
college
mate
of
mine
a
poet
and
man
of
literary
and
refined
tastes
knowing
nothing
of
the
world
he
was
a
french
scholar
and
employed
at
first
as
translator
henry
lee
who
was
also
his
college
mate
and
had
also
a
friendly
feeling
for
him
was
the
more
immediate
cause
of
his
establishing
a
paper
our
main
object
in
encouraging
it
was
to
provide
an
antidote
against
paper
which
was
devoted
to
monarchy
and
had
begun
to
publish
extracts
from
adams
book
i
used
occasionally
to
throw
in
an
article
all
of
which
i
have
marked
and
some
of
which
i
have
shown
you
with
a
view
chiefly
to
counteract
the
monarchial
spirit
and
partisanship
of
the
british
government
which
characterized
fenno
paper
i
never
engaged
in
the
party
criminations
it
deserves
mention
that
freneau
stuck
to
his
post
during
the
yellow
fever
epidemic
of
and
that
for
weeks
he
was
the
only
active
editor
in
the
city
on
october
he
resigned
his
position
as
translator
and
soon
after
removed
to
his
old
home
at
mount
pleasant
for
a
time
he
was
without
employment
he
contemplated
several
newspaper
enterprises
he
evidently
took
steps
toward
the
publication
of
a
paper
in
monmouth
county
new
jersey
as
the
following
advertisement
published
in
the
may
would
show
a
number
of
persons
in
freehold
and
other
parts
of
monmouth
subscribed
last
year
to
a
paper
the
editor
then
proposed
to
set
on
foot
as
various
causes
delayed
him
prosecuting
his
intended
purpose
until
the
present
spring
and
as
he
supposes
many
of
them
might
in
the
meantime
have
engaged
with
other
printers
he
hopes
they
will
if
possible
transfer
their
subscription
to
the
on
november
he
writes
madison
recommending
his
old
friend
bailey
for
the
office
of
public
printer
and
on
may
following
he
received
a
reply
i
delayed
acknowledging
your
favour
long
ago
received
until
i
could
inform
you
of
the
prospects
of
bailey
in
whose
favor
it
was
written
i
have
now
the
pleasure
to
tell
you
that
although
his
wishes
are
not
to
be
immediately
fulfilled
he
is
looking
to
obtain
under
the
auspices
of
beckley
and
randolph
a
share
of
employment
hereafter
which
may
be
very
valuable
to
him
i
congratulate
you
on
the
public
intelligence
just
received
from
holland
which
gives
joy
to
all
true
republicans
and
wish
you
all
the
private
happiness
which
an
exchange
of
your
former
travelled
scenes
for
the
shade
and
tranquility
of
your
present
life
can
afford
remember
however
as
you
have
not
chosen
any
longer
to
labor
in
the
field
of
politics
it
will
be
expected
by
your
friends
that
you
cultivate
with
the
more
industry
your
inheritance
on
parnassus
on
may
the
following
freneau
continued
the
correspondence
my
respected
friend
by
some
accident
your
kind
letter
of
april
was
a
long
time
in
finding
its
way
hither
having
not
come
to
hand
till
the
inst
i
sincerely
thank
you
for
the
interest
you
have
taken
in
bailey
he
is
a
good
republican
and
a
worthy
honest
man
which
qualifications
i
have
thought
entitled
him
to
some
notice
from
the
government
in
his
line
of
business
i
was
heartily
laughed
at
however
a
few
weeks
ago
in
york
by
some
aristocrats
for
having
in
my
letter
to
you
or
beckley
i
forget
which
extolled
his
military
services
in
the
late
war
i
am
sensible
he
never
cut
off
the
heads
of
giants
or
drove
hosts
before
him
as
some
have
done
at
the
same
time
it
ought
to
be
remembered
that
he
was
an
officer
in
the
pennsylvania
militia
in
the
season
that
tried
men
souls
as
paine
says
and
i
believe
never
acted
otherwise
than
became
the
character
in
which
he
i
meet
you
at
least
half
way
in
your
congratulations
on
the
public
intelligence
received
from
holland
it
is
but
another
step
toward
the
advancement
and
completion
of
that
great
and
philanthropic
system
which
i
have
been
anticipating
for
many
years
and
which
you
as
well
as
myself
i
hope
will
live
to
see
realized
when
i
first
went
to
reside
in
philada
in
i
wished
to
be
one
of
those
who
would
have
the
honour
and
happiness
of
announcing
these
great
events
to
the
public
through
the
medium
of
a
newspaper
a
variety
of
circumstances
however
needless
to
trouble
you
with
urged
my
departure
from
that
city
after
completing
a
two
years
publication
as
i
mean
to
pass
the
remainder
of
my
days
on
a
couple
of
hundred
of
acres
of
an
old
sandy
patrimony
i
have
by
the
way
of
filling
up
the
vacuities
of
time
set
on
foot
a
small
weekly
newspaper
calculated
for
the
part
of
the
country
in
which
i
am
should
you
have
any
curiosity
to
see
it
i
will
forward
it
to
you
free
of
all
expence
except
that
of
postage
i
will
not
make
high
promises
in
regard
to
what
it
may
contain
it
will
scarcely
be
expected
that
in
a
rude
barbarous
part
of
the
country
i
could
calculate
it
for
the
polite
taste
of
should
your
fixed
residence
be
in
philada
i
can
transmit
the
papers
to
you
once
a
week
by
the
public
post
who
stops
every
wednesday
at
my
door
a
letter
put
into
the
post
office
at
philadelphia
on
saturday
morning
will
be
sure
to
reach
me
on
the
public
papers
some
time
ago
announced
your
i
wish
you
all
possible
happiness
with
the
lady
whom
you
have
chosen
for
your
companion
through
life
freneau
joins
me
in
the
same
and
desires
me
to
present
her
best
respects
to
your
lady
and
yourself
and
should
you
ever
take
an
excursion
to
these
parts
of
jersey
we
will
endeavour
to
give
madison
and
yourself
not
a
costly
welcome
yet
a
kind
the
an
paper
of
the
size
of
a
sheet
of
letter
paper
issued
its
initial
number
from
the
editor
little
office
at
mount
pleasant
saturday
may
it
bore
the
motto
sylvas
academi
quaerere
hor
and
its
object
in
the
words
of
its
editor
was
to
present
a
complete
history
of
the
foreign
and
domestic
events
of
the
times
together
with
such
essays
remarks
and
observations
as
shall
tend
to
illustrate
the
politics
or
mark
the
general
character
of
the
age
and
country
in
which
we
live
the
salutatory
is
characteristic
of
its
author
never
was
there
a
more
interesting
period
than
the
present
nor
ever
was
there
a
time
within
the
reach
of
history
when
mankind
have
been
so
generally
united
in
attending
to
the
cultivation
of
the
mind
examining
into
the
natural
and
political
rights
of
nations
and
emancipating
themselves
from
those
shackles
of
despotism
which
have
so
long
impeded
the
happiness
of
the
human
species
and
rendered
the
rights
of
the
many
subservient
to
the
interests
of
the
few
at
this
time
when
new
republics
are
forming
and
new
empires
bursting
into
birth
when
the
great
family
of
mankind
are
evidently
making
their
egress
from
the
dark
shadows
of
despotism
which
have
so
long
enveloped
them
are
assuming
a
character
suitable
to
the
dignity
of
their
species
the
editor
seizes
the
opportunity
to
renew
his
efforts
for
contributing
in
some
small
degree
to
the
general
information
of
his
fellow
citizens
in
the
present
history
and
politics
of
the
world
no
pains
shall
be
spared
on
his
part
to
procure
the
best
the
most
authentic
and
earliest
intelligence
from
every
quarter
and
circulating
it
by
every
method
and
means
in
his
power
and
to
whatever
parts
his
subscription
will
enable
him
to
do
it
when
it
is
considered
that
few
advertisements
are
reasonably
to
be
expected
in
these
more
eastern
parts
of
the
terms
of
subscription
will
appear
low
and
it
may
be
added
are
within
the
power
of
almost
every
man
who
has
the
will
and
inclination
to
encourage
literature
promote
the
interests
or
enlarge
the
ideas
of
the
rising
generation
and
contribute
to
the
general
diffusion
of
knowledge
among
his
fellow
citizens
should
the
publication
of
the
jersey
chronicle
be
suitably
encouraged
the
editor
will
in
due
time
enlarge
the
size
of
the
sheet
but
that
now
published
on
is
in
his
opinion
every
way
adequate
to
an
experiment
whether
the
attempt
be
practicable
or
not
freneau
essays
contributed
to
the
are
among
the
most
notable
prose
productions
from
his
pen
he
began
a
series
of
studies
on
monarchial
and
mixed
forms
of
government
he
wrote
observations
on
monarchy
and
discussed
at
length
the
leading
arguments
for
and
against
jay
treaty
with
england
on
may
he
began
to
publish
a
series
of
papers
entitled
tomo
cheeki
the
creek
indian
in
philadelphia
in
which
the
manners
and
absurdities
of
the
americans
are
described
from
the
standpoint
of
an
observant
savage
in
nearly
every
issue
of
the
paper
there
was
an
elaborate
essay
on
some
political
subject
of
poetry
there
was
very
little
the
had
contained
little
poetry
from
the
editor
pen
save
earlier
verses
reprinted
and
a
few
political
satires
and
republican
lyrics
the
influence
of
peter
pindar
was
becoming
more
and
more
manifest
in
the
poet
style
politics
and
party
strife
had
for
a
time
displaced
the
muse
this
is
nowhere
more
evident
than
in
the
collected
edition
of
his
poems
printed
on
his
own
press
and
issued
in
june
in
many
respects
this
is
the
most
interesting
of
freneau
collections
it
brings
us
into
the
very
presence
of
the
poet
the
earlier
editions
had
been
published
without
his
supervision
the
material
for
this
one
passed
all
of
it
under
the
author
critical
eye
scarcely
a
poem
escaped
revision
after
noting
the
scrupulous
care
with
which
he
changed
adjectives
improved
rhymes
added
new
stanzas
or
cut
out
old
ones
repunctuated
sentences
and
rearranged
material
one
can
not
join
the
somewhat
large
band
of
hasty
and
superficial
critics
who
allude
flippantly
to
the
poet
as
a
hasty
and
careless
improviser
of
ephemeral
trash
as
a
matter
of
fact
freneau
was
a
miser
with
his
verses
when
a
newspaper
poem
suspected
to
be
his
especially
in
the
period
previous
to
can
not
be
found
in
any
of
his
collections
grave
doubts
at
once
arise
as
to
whether
the
poem
is
his
he
was
never
tired
of
revising
and
cutting
and
pruning
the
poems
so
carefully
edited
in
were
again
carefully
revised
in
as
an
instance
of
his
concern
for
the
fate
of
his
poems
let
me
quote
a
letter
written
august
to
matthew
carey
i
see
by
this
day
paper
that
my
verses
on
general
arrival
are
to
appear
in
your
next
if
it
is
not
too
late
i
would
request
the
favour
of
you
to
rectify
an
error
which
was
entirely
of
the
press
in
the
fifth
line
of
the
thirteenth
stanza
as
it
materially
affects
the
sense
instead
of
please
to
read
the
edition
is
interesting
from
another
standpoint
the
resources
of
the
little
country
office
were
taxed
to
the
utmost
in
the
production
of
the
book
at
best
it
is
a
crude
piece
of
printing
there
is
manifest
everywhere
an
effort
to
keep
the
work
within
bounds
to
economize
space
titles
are
abbreviated
mottoes
dropped
foot
notes
cut
out
and
many
earlier
poems
reduced
or
omitted
entirely
the
list
of
omissions
is
very
suggestive
scenes
one
and
two
were
cut
from
the
pictures
of
columbus
the
long
song
of
ismenius
was
dropped
from
the
monument
of
phaon
the
jamaica
funeral
and
the
house
of
night
were
reduced
to
mere
fragments
female
frailty
was
dropped
save
for
the
opening
lyric
and
there
were
other
notable
changes
in
every
case
it
will
be
found
that
the
poet
threw
overboard
the
light
and
imaginative
element
the
purely
poetic
the
reason
for
these
omissions
has
been
often
sought
richardson
in
particular
has
wondered
at
the
dropping
of
the
intensely
original
and
weirdly
strong
poem
the
house
of
night
in
his
opinion
the
best
thing
freneau
ever
did
it
is
not
difficult
to
answer
the
question
after
a
careful
study
of
the
evolution
of
freneau
poetic
ideals
he
began
to
write
poetry
after
a
thorough
course
of
reading
in
the
latin
and
english
classics
his
early
work
is
redolent
of
eclogues
of
horace
of
shakespeare
of
milton
minor
poems
of
gray
elegy
if
ever
there
was
a
sensitive
poetic
soul
the
young
freneau
was
one
in
his
early
inexperience
he
even
dreamed
of
a
poetic
career
in
which
he
might
perhaps
win
a
place
beside
the
great
masters
of
song
his
early
work
like
the
ode
to
fancy
and
similar
pieces
and
the
strong
and
original
house
of
night
and
santa
cruz
show
what
he
might
have
done
in
another
environment
but
revolutionary
america
had
little
encouragement
for
an
imaginative
poet
there
was
something
in
the
air
that
seemed
to
put
into
men
the
franklin
spirit
it
was
the
era
of
of
stern
reality
of
practical
affairs
madison
voiced
the
age
when
in
he
advised
bradford
the
cultured
and
imaginative
young
lover
of
poetry
and
all
art
to
turn
to
sterner
things
i
was
afraid
you
would
not
easily
have
loosened
your
affections
from
the
belles
lettres
a
delicate
taste
and
warm
imagination
like
yours
must
find
it
hard
to
give
up
such
refined
exquisite
enjoyments
for
the
coarse
and
dry
study
of
the
law
it
is
like
leaving
a
pleasant
flourishing
field
for
a
barren
desert
perhaps
i
should
not
say
barren
either
because
the
law
does
bear
fruit
but
it
is
sour
fruit
that
must
be
gathered
and
pressed
and
distilled
before
it
can
bring
pleasure
or
profit
i
myself
use
to
have
too
great
a
hankering
after
those
amusing
studies
poetry
wit
and
criticism
romances
plays
c
captivated
me
much
but
i
begin
to
discover
that
they
deserve
but
a
moderate
portion
of
a
time
and
that
something
more
substantial
more
durable
more
profitable
befits
our
riper
age
it
would
be
exceeding
improper
for
a
labouring
man
to
have
nothing
but
flowers
in
his
garden
or
to
determine
to
eat
nothing
but
and
confections
equally
absurd
would
it
be
for
a
scholar
and
man
of
business
to
make
up
his
whole
library
with
books
of
fancy
and
feed
his
mind
with
nothing
but
such
luscious
performances
the
first
half
of
freneau
life
as
we
have
seen
was
one
of
disillusion
it
took
years
to
kill
the
spark
in
his
breast
but
the
process
though
slow
was
sure
after
the
fierce
period
of
the
he
thought
of
himself
only
as
a
worker
in
the
tide
of
practical
affairs
a
champion
of
the
rights
of
man
a
protestor
against
tyranny
and
wrong
and
his
muse
had
become
a
mere
drudge
aiding
by
satire
and
song
what
he
now
conceived
to
be
his
life
work
he
had
taken
a
deliberate
though
sorrowful
leave
of
his
early
muse
in
one
year
after
the
appearance
of
his
first
volume
of
poems
on
these
bleak
climes
by
fortune
thrown
where
rigid
reason
reigns
alone
where
flowery
fancy
holds
no
sway
nor
golden
forms
around
her
play
nor
nature
takes
her
magic
hue
alas
what
has
the
muse
to
do
an
age
employed
in
painting
steel
can
no
poetic
raptures
feel
no
fabled
love
enchanting
power
no
tale
of
flora
shady
bower
nor
haunt
or
murmuring
grove
can
its
prosaic
bosom
move
the
muse
of
love
in
no
request
i
try
my
fortune
with
the
rest
which
of
the
nine
shall
i
engage
to
suit
the
humor
of
the
age
on
one
alas
my
choice
must
fall
the
least
engaging
of
them
all
her
visage
stern
severe
her
style
a
clouded
brow
a
cruel
smile
a
mind
on
murdered
victims
placed
she
only
she
can
please
the
taste
one
can
not
read
long
the
columns
of
the
without
realizing
forcibly
the
change
that
had
come
over
freneau
the
poet
who
emerged
from
the
crucible
of
the
was
not
at
all
like
the
poet
of
the
house
of
night
period
he
could
look
upon
this
product
of
his
early
imagination
much
as
madison
would
have
done
and
he
could
in
cold
blood
cut
it
down
to
a
mere
fragment
which
would
voice
his
new
french
deistic
ideas
that
he
might
have
room
for
his
republican
songs
the
poem
to
the
americans
of
the
united
states
written
in
gives
us
a
true
picture
of
this
later
freneau
he
would
be
no
courtly
singer
beneath
some
great
man
ceiling
placed
no
solitary
dreamer
he
would
be
a
man
of
action
travelling
over
lands
and
seas
a
poet
who
caught
his
subjects
from
the
varying
scene
of
human
things
to
seize
some
from
the
faithless
past
be
this
our
care
before
the
century
close
the
colours
strong
for
if
we
deem
aright
the
age
will
be
an
age
of
when
will
break
the
muses
dream
and
common
sense
be
ranked
in
seat
supreme
with
the
number
of
the
published
april
the
paper
came
to
an
end
freneau
final
editorial
stated
that
in
number
one
of
the
jersey
chronicle
the
editor
announced
his
intention
of
extending
the
publication
beyond
the
first
year
provided
the
attempt
should
in
the
meantime
be
suitably
encouraged
and
found
practicable
but
the
necessary
number
of
subscribers
having
not
yet
appeared
scarcely
to
defray
the
expenses
of
the
undertaking
notwithstanding
the
very
low
rate
at
which
it
has
been
offered
the
editor
with
some
regret
declines
a
further
prosecution
of
his
plan
at
this
time
he
embraces
the
present
opportunity
to
return
his
sincere
thanks
to
such
persons
in
this
and
the
neighboring
counties
as
have
favored
him
with
their
subscriptions
and
have
also
by
their
punctuality
in
complying
with
the
terms
originally
proposed
thus
far
enabled
him
to
issue
a
free
independent
and
republican
paper
a
letter
written
by
freneau
from
new
york
to
madison
dated
december
reveals
what
was
in
the
poet
mind
during
the
months
following
the
abandonment
of
the
having
three
or
four
months
since
formed
a
resolution
to
bid
adieu
for
a
few
years
to
some
old
trees
in
jersey
under
the
shade
of
which
i
edited
amongst
ditching
and
grubbing
a
small
weekly
paper
entitled
the
jersey
chronicle
i
did
not
know
how
to
employ
that
interval
better
than
in
striking
out
here
with
some
printer
if
such
could
be
found
already
engaged
in
supporting
the
good
old
republican
cause
after
experiencing
one
or
two
disappointments
in
accomplishing
this
object
i
am
now
through
the
kind
aid
of
some
friends
here
nearly
completing
the
project
of
a
copartnership
with
thomas
greenleaf
in
his
two
papers
a
daily
publication
and
the
new
york
journal
twice
a
week
both
on
a
pretty
respectable
footing
and
noted
for
a
steady
attachment
to
republican
principles
though
open
to
all
decent
speculations
from
any
party
if
they
choose
to
transmit
them
in
short
i
would
wish
to
revive
something
in
the
spirit
of
the
national
gazette
if
time
and
circumstances
allow
and
with
proper
assistance
hope
to
succeed
thus
a
raven
once
an
acorn
took
from
bashan
strongest
stoutest
tree
he
hid
it
near
a
murmuring
brook
and
liv
another
oak
to
see
as
i
consider
the
bargain
the
same
as
concluded
my
next
object
is
to
make
all
the
friends
here
that
i
decently
can
among
men
of
eminence
and
ability
this
i
have
in
some
small
degree
attempted
and
gained
but
for
want
of
certain
insinuating
qualities
natural
enough
i
suppose
to
some
men
i
feel
myself
sadly
at
a
loss
to
get
acquainted
with
some
characters
here
to
whom
i
could
wish
to
be
known
upon
motives
of
public
as
well
as
private
utility
among
these
is
the
chancellor
of
this
state
robert
livingston
with
whom
if
i
recollect
right
you
are
upon
terms
of
intimacy
if
i
am
not
mistaken
in
this
point
and
you
can
with
propriety
accede
to
my
request
you
would
confer
a
favor
upon
me
by
mentioning
me
to
him
in
your
next
letter
in
such
manner
as
you
may
think
best
so
that
this
new
connexion
may
attract
some
share
of
his
attention
and
thereby
the
countenance
of
the
livingston
family
in
general
which
would
operate
greatly
through
this
state
at
least
in
advancing
our
subscription
and
printing
interest
in
general
the
partnership
with
greenleaf
mentioned
to
madison
for
some
reason
was
never
consummated
on
march
however
freneau
issued
in
new
york
the
first
number
of
a
new
journal
time
piece
and
literary
to
be
devoted
to
literary
amusement
and
an
abridgement
of
the
most
interesting
intelligence
foreign
and
domestic
he
associated
himself
as
he
expressed
it
as
a
partner
in
the
typographical
line
of
business
with
alexander
menut
of
that
profession
sometime
since
from
canada
though
during
the
first
year
at
least
freneau
had
entire
control
of
the
editing
of
the
paper
his
address
to
the
public
is
of
considerable
interest
several
months
having
elapsed
since
the
publication
of
a
periodical
paper
in
this
city
was
first
contemplated
by
the
subscriber
he
now
informs
his
friends
and
the
public
in
general
that
he
has
at
length
so
far
matured
his
plan
as
to
attempt
a
paper
of
this
kind
to
be
published
three
times
a
week
and
transmitted
to
city
subscribers
early
on
monday
wednesday
and
friday
mornings
the
piece
and
literary
will
on
all
occasions
be
open
to
political
moral
or
other
interesting
discussion
from
any
quarter
whatever
provided
such
communications
are
written
with
candor
decency
and
liberality
their
object
such
as
to
promote
the
general
good
of
our
great
confederate
commonwealth
or
the
common
interest
of
man
and
conceived
in
that
disinterested
spirit
which
while
it
carefully
avoids
as
far
as
possible
irritating
the
feelings
of
individuals
holds
itself
obligated
under
any
circumstances
whatever
to
consider
truth
the
moral
and
political
happiness
of
our
species
social
harmony
and
good
order
the
basis
of
all
its
exertions
the
end
of
all
its
aims
views
and
endeavors
the
paper
is
a
tastily
arranged
and
neatly
printed
sheet
and
its
contents
show
constantly
its
editor
rare
ability
to
cater
to
the
public
needs
refinement
and
a
fastidious
taste
are
evidenced
everywhere
in
its
columns
duyckinck
comments
on
the
skill
of
the
selection
and
the
general
elegance
of
the
material
which
were
certainly
unusual
in
those
early
days
of
american
journalism
the
paper
had
a
large
number
of
feminine
contributors
who
gave
freely
of
their
sentimental
lyrics
and
sprightly
letters
the
poet
himself
contributed
many
poems
the
most
of
them
as
usual
concerned
with
contemporary
affairs
he
republished
his
translation
from
the
abbé
robin
made
in
since
as
he
declared
only
a
small
edition
was
then
printed
and
the
work
was
in
the
hands
of
a
very
few
he
republished
also
his
tomo
cheeki
letters
introducing
them
thus
a
number
of
eccentric
writings
under
the
subsequent
title
and
to
the
amount
of
a
considerable
volume
are
in
the
hands
of
the
editor
of
the
time
piece
said
to
be
translated
from
one
of
the
indian
languages
of
this
country
they
were
transmitted
to
him
more
than
two
years
ago
and
a
few
numbers
published
in
a
gazette
edited
by
him
in
a
neighboring
state
but
discontinued
with
that
paper
if
the
contributions
of
a
rude
aboriginal
of
america
shall
appear
to
afford
any
gratification
to
the
generality
of
our
readers
the
whole
will
be
occasionally
offered
to
the
public
through
the
medium
of
the
time
piece
his
pen
was
constantly
active
he
wrote
vigorous
editorials
on
all
passing
political
measures
and
on
september
proposed
to
edit
ledyard
journals
the
subscriber
having
procured
from
the
hands
of
his
relatives
the
original
mss
of
ledyard
now
offers
to
the
public
of
the
united
states
an
opportunity
of
gratifying
their
curiosity
and
at
the
same
time
paying
a
token
of
respect
to
the
memory
of
ledyard
travels
will
be
compiled
by
freneau
from
the
original
mss
of
the
author
consisting
of
letters
journals
notes
and
such
documents
as
have
appeared
in

both
in
america
and
europe
particularly
a
work
published
by
the
british
african
society
in
whose
service
with
a
view
of
exploring
the
interior
of
africa
his
last
expedition
was
undertaken
and
terminated
in
his
death
at
cairo
in

one
vol
at

pages
a
life
of
the
author
collected
from
authentic
materials
will
be
prefixed
to
the
work
with
some
other
preliminary
matter
freneau
evidently
made
some
progress
with
the
work
for
on
august
the
following
advertisement
appeared
in
the
as
well
as
in
the

lettered
calculated
to
contain
between
and
pages
per
volume
the
volume
whether
from
a
failure
to
secure
subscribers
or
other
reasons
was
never
published
the
partnership
of
freneau
and
menut
was
dissolved
september
and
shortly
after
the
imprint
of
the
paper
was
changed
to
read
published
by
freneau
and
davis
no
moore
street
near
whitehall
on
january
freneau
made
a
visit
to
charleston
taking
passage
in
the
sloop
and
arriving
after
a
rough
voyage
of
days
during
the
following
month
he
was
the
guest
of
his
brother
peter
and
in
the
words
of
his
daughter
of
his
many
friends
there
among
whom
were
charles
pinckney
governor
of
south
carolina
charles
cotesworth
pinckney
general
bull
edge
and
many
others
where
he
was
as
much
at
home
as
at
his
brother
he
embarked
from
charleston
march
and
arrived
in
new
york
after
a
week
voyage
the
affairs
of
the
were
in
a
critical
condition
a
part
of
the
subscribers
lived
at
a
distance
from
new
york
and
the
expenses
were
large
freneau
was
unwilling
to
run
further
risks
and
a
few
days
after
his
return
from
the
south
he
withdrew
from
the
firm
having
been
editor
of
the
paper
just
one
year
he
thereupon
retired
with
his
family
to
the
little
estate
at
mount
pleasant
where
he
made
his
home
for
the
rest
of
his
life
vi
the
quiet
period
after
the
anxiety
and
stress
of
editorship
in
a
great
city
was
for
a
time
grateful
to
the
poet
he
managed
the
farm
in
a
desultory
way
but
his
main
occupation
was
composing
verses
under
his
favorite
locust
tree
which
had
been
planted
by
his
father
and
which
had
increased
in
size
and
numbers
until
in
the
words
of
his
daughter
it
was
a
complete
grove
of
locust
trees
surrounding
a
house
grown
old
with
its
time
worn
owner
his
venerable
mother
and
maiden
sister
beloved
and
respected
for
her
many
virtues
her
decease
which
took
place
a
few
years
previous
to
his
own
he
says
in
an
obituary
he
can
say
no
more
nor
less
than
that
was
as
good
and
innocent
as
an
angel
this
sister
mary
freneau
a
beautiful
woman
had
been
wooed
at
one
time
by
madison
but
for
some
reason
she
had
refused
him
freneau
family
consisted
of
four
daughters
eleanor
born
in
agnes
born
june
catherine
born
february
and
margaret
alaire
born
june
eleanor
married
a
hammill
and
the
four
daughters
of
this
union
died
unmarried
agnes
married
edward
leadbeater
and
the
eldest
son
of
this
union
at
the
earnest
request
of
the
poet
was
christened
philip
leadbeater
freneau
his
grandfather
putting
into
his
infant
hands
the
ancestral
bible
which
was
the
family
treasure
the
descendants
of
agnes
freneau
and
leadbeater
are
very
numerous
the
two
younger
daughters
of
the
poet
never
married
the
active
pen
of
freneau
so
long
practiced
in
discussing
the
affairs
of
the
day
could
not
rest
idle
during
his
period
of
retirement
he
began
a
series
of
letters
to
the
philadelphia
and
other
papers
and
on
december
issued
them
in
a
volume
entitled
letters
on
various
interesting
and
important
subjects
many
of
which
have
appeared
in
the
aurora
it
bore
his
old
pen
name
robert
slender
with
the
added
title
interpreted
later
to
mean
one
of
the
swinish
multitude
the
book
has
surprising
merit
the
letters
are
written
in
a
breezy
colloquial
style
and
the
old
cobbler
is
well
characterized
freneau
has
actually
succeeded
in
making
him
a
living
creature
and
his
opinions
and
whim
whams
are
full
of
hard
sense
and
practical
wisdom
the
book
is
by
all
means
the
best
prose
that
freneau
ever
wrote
so
easy
is
the
style
and
so
natural
is
the
characterization
that
i
can
not
forbear
quoting
at
some
length
from
a
chapter
chosen
almost
at
random
letter
xxii
editor
having
heard
that
there
was
a
tavern
at
about
the
distance
of
a
mile
or
so
from
my
favourite
country
spot
where
now
and
then
a
few
neighbours
meet
to
spit
smoke
segars
drink
apple
whiskey
cider
or
and
read
the
news
a
few
evenings
ago
i
put
on
my
best
coat
combed
out
my
wig
put
my
spectacles
in
my
pocket
and
a
quarter
dollar
this
i
thought
was
right
for
although
mrs
slender
told
me
was
enough
says
i
i
take
the
quarter
dollar
for
a
man
always
feels
himself
of
more
consequence
when
he
has
got
good
money
in
his
pocket
so
out
i
walks
with
a
good
stout
stick
in
my
hand
which
i
always
make
a
point
to
carry
with
me
lest
the
dogs
should
make
rather
freer
with
my
legs
than
i
could
wish
but
i
had
not
gone
more
than
half
the
way
when
by
making
a
false
step
i
splash
my
stocking
from
knee
to
the
ancle
odds
my
heart
said
i
see
what
a
hand
i
have
made
of
my
stocking
i
be
bail
added
i
i
hear
of
this
in
both
sides
of
my
head
but
it
ca
now
be
helped
this
and
a
thousand
worse
accidents
which
daily
happen
are
all
occasioned
by
public
neglect
and
the
misapplication
of
the
public
money
had
i
said
i
talking
to
myself
all
the
while
the
disposal
of
but
half
the
income
of
the
united
states
i
could
at
least
so
order
matters
that
a
man
might
walk
to
his
next
neighbour
without
splashing
his
stockings
or
being
in
danger
of
breaking
his
legs
in
ruts
holes
gutts
and
gullies
i
do
not
know
says
i
to
myself
as
i
moralized
on
my
splash
stocking
but
money
might
with
more
profit
be
laid
out
in
repairing
the
roads
than
in
marine
establishments
supporting
a
standing
army
useless
embassies
exorbitant
salaries
given
to
many
flashy
fellows
that
are
no
honour
to
us
or
to
themselves
and
chartering
whole
ships
to
carry
a
single
man
to
another
nation
odds
my
life
continued
i
what
a
number
of
difficulties
a
man
labours
under
who
has
never
read
further
than
grammar
and
has
but
a
poor
brain
had
i
been
favoured
with
a
good
education
i
could
no
doubt
readily
see
the
of
all
these
measures
of
government
that
now
appear
to
me
so
unaccountable
i
could
then
said
i
still
talking
to
myself
see
the
reason
why
the
old
patriots
whose
blood
flowed
so
freely
in
purchasing
our
independence
are
cast
aside
like
a
broken
pitcher
as
the
scripture
says
and
why
the
old
tories
and
active
refugees
are
advanced
to
places
of
power
honour
and
trust
i
could
then
be
able
to
explain
why
robbins
an
american
citizen
for
killing
an
englishman
who
held
him
a
slave
and
so
gaining
his
liberty
was
delivered
to
the
english
to
be
hanged
and
sterret
who
killed
a
veteran
sailor
who
had
formerly
fought
and
bled
in
the
cause
of
his
country
and
then
was
bravely
doing
his
duty
yet
remains
unpunished
as
i
said
this
by
accident
i
looked
up
and
perceived
to
my
surprise
that
if
i
had
gone
but
one
step
further
i
would
have
actually
knocked
my
nose
against
the
i
declare
said
i
here
i
am
this
is
a
tavern
indeed
i
then
felt
in
my
pocket
if
i
had
my
quarter
dollar
which
to
my
joy
i
found
i
then
unbuttoned
my
coat
to
shew
my
silk
waistcoat
pulled
my
watch
chain
a
good
piece
longer
out
of
my
pocket
fixed
my
hat
a
little
better
on
my
head
and
then
advanced
boldly
into
the
tavern
but
i
see
i
am
got
to
the
end
of
my
page
and
therefore
must
defer
the
remainder
of
my
adventure
to
another
opportunity
in
the
advertisement
of
the
book
the
author
made
the
half
promise
of
more
letters
in
the
same
vein
should
these
letters
meet
with
a
favourable
reception
in
their
present
form
a
second
volume
will
shortly
be
published
containing
besides
those
that
have
since
appeared
separately
a
variety
of
original
ones
upon
such
interesting
subjects
as
may
hereafter
claim
the
public
attention
the
volume
was
never
published
the
little
family
at
mount
pleasant
could
not
subsist
alone
on
letters
and
poems
however
brilliant
the
outlook
was
not
a
bright
one
as
the
following
letter
to
his
brother
peter
in
charleston
dated
march
would
indicate
having
been
here
new
york
a
day
or
two
and
finding
the
brig
echo
capt
webb
to
sail
for
charleston
i
take
the
opportunity
of
dropping
you
a
line
by
him
i
left
all
well
at
home
last
thursday
and
the
place
as
well
as
could
be
expected
after
my
poor
mother
absence
i
have
been
and
shall
be
for
some
time
busy
in
repairing
old
fences
and
making
new
ones
and
some
other
small
improvements
as
far
as
i
personally
can
with
the
money
you
let
me
have
helen

to
school
here
the
other
two
girls
are
at
home
but
agnes
is
to
come
here
next
month
for
the
same
purpose
for
awhile
there
are
more
cares
and
vexations
coming
on
but
still
they
must
be
got
through
with
at
some
rate
probably
i
shall
have
to
embark
on
some
new
expedition
or
plan
before
long
wherever
or
to
whatever
the
devil
shall
see
fit
to
drive
me
but
i
shall
attempt
nothing
if
i
can
before
i
see
you
here
in
april
or
may
as
you
promised
i
return
this
morning
to
jersey
hunn
peggy
mamma
and
polly
all
desire
their
love
to
you
my
love
and
respects
to
freneau
and
miss
dora
with
her
mother
and
family
remembrances
love
to
davis
and
may
i
expect
to
have
a
line
from
you
by
capt
peter
freneau
was
at
best
a
farmer
a
little
anecdote
told
by
the
family
is
eloquent
one
day
the
poet
and
his
wife
who
had
walked
together
into
the
field
to
inspect
the
work
found
a
slave
asleep
in
the
young
corn
freneau
seizing
his
hoe
declared
that
she
would
show
him
how
to
work
at
the
very
first
attempt
however
she
cut
down
a
hill
of
corn
whereupon
the
slave
remarked
gleefully
ho
ho
missie
freneau
if
that
the
way
you
hoe
the
corn
never
grow
she
threw
down
the
hoe
in
disgust
declaring
that
no
wonder
the
farm
does
pay
when
even
the
slaves
talk
in
rhymes
the
affairs
of
the
poet
were
soon
such
as
to
give
real
concern
to
his
friends
in
a
letter
dated
september
a
part
of
which
we
have
already
quoted
aedanus
burke
wrote
madison
i
am
sorry
to
have
it
to
say
that
freneau
with
his
wife
and
two
children
is
still
in
embarrassed
circumstances
he
is
a
virtuous
honest
man
and
an
undeviating
republican
yet
utterly
incapable
of
soliciting
anything
for
himself
the
best
apology
i
can
offer
for
mentioning
it
is
that
i
know
you
have
great
regard
for
him
you
were
at
college
together
as
i
heard
you
often
say
however
this
letter
may
have
been
received
freneau
obtained
no
appointment
either
from
madison
or
jefferson
though
there
is
a
persistent
tradition
among
his
descendants
that
he
was
offered
a
good
position
under
president
jefferson
but
refused
it
on
the
ground
that
the
latter
had
deserted
him
in
the
affair
on
october
his
friend
francis
bailey
addressed
madison
my
dear
sir
the
death
of
bauman
of
new
york
has
left
the
post
office
without
a
master
i
know
of
no
man
in
the
united
states
who
would
fill
the
office
with
more
ability
or
greater
integrity
than
philip
freneau
as
far
as
we
know
there
was
no
response
though
the
family
declare
that
madison
sent
for
him
and
that
the
poet
proudly
said
james
madison
knows
where
i
live
let
him
come
to
see
me
the
expedition
to
mend
his
fortunes
which
he
had
mentioned
to
his
brother
as
a
disagreeable
possibility
became
at
length
inevitable
on
saturday
november
he
embarked
at
new
york
as
master
of
the
schooner
bound
for
fredericksburg
virginia
with
a
cargo
of
salt
a
minute
log
book
of
this
voyage
is
still
to
be
seen
after
an
exceedingly
hard
experience
he
returned
to
new
york
january
and
the
last
entry
in
the
log
reads
finished
discharging
the
wheat
bushels
at
cents
a
bushel
freight
dollars
and
cents
this
was
the
opening
voyage
of
his
last
period
at
sea
his
brother
peter
had
fitted
out
at
charleston
a
new
brig
for
the
madeira
trade
and
until
freneau
was
busy
plying
between
charleston
and
the
azores
in
one
of
his
books
of
navigation
is
inscribed

he
made
his
last
voyage
to
the
azores
in
the
in
during
this
last
period
of
sea
life
we
find
evidences
everywhere
that
this
old
enthusiasm
for
nautical
adventure
had
greatly
waned
he
was
a
sailor
now
from
sheer
necessity
he
was
approaching
old
age
and
he
longed
for
the
quiet
of
his
home
and
his
family
in
one
of
his
books
of
navigation
of
this
period
is
penned
a
verse
made
in
mid
atlantic
in
dreams
condemned
to
roam
he
left

and
tide
proceeding
an
imaginary
way
in
freneau
now
in
retirement
at
mount
pleasant
began
a
new
edition
of
his
poems
on
april
he
wrote
madison
sir
i
do
myself
the
pleasure
to
enclose
to
you
a
copy
of
proposals
for
the
publication
of
a
couple
of
volumes
of
poems
shortly
to
be
put
to
the
press
in
this
city
perhaps
some
of
your
particular
friends
in
virginia
may
be
induced
from
a
view
of
the
proposals
in
your
hands
to
subscribe
their
names
if
so
please
to
have
them
forwarded
to
this
place
by
post
addressed
to
the
publisher
at
no
north
alley
philadelphia
accept
my
congratulations
on
your
late
election
to
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
and
my
hopes
that
your
weight
of
state
affairs
may
receive
every
alleviation
in
the
gratitude
and
esteem
of
the
public
whom
you
serve
in
your
truly
honourable
and
exalted
station
madison
reply
has
been
lost
but
on
may
freneau
answered
from
philadelphia
sir
after
a
month
ramble
through
the
states
of
new
jersey
and
new
york
i
returned
to
this
place
on
saturday
last
and
found
your
friendly
letter
on
bailey
table
with
the
contents
there
was
no
occasion
of
enclosing
any
money
as
your
name
was
all
i
wanted
to
have
placed
at
the
head
of
the
subscription
i
hope
you
will
credit
me
when
i
say
that
the
republication
of
these
poems
such
as
they
are
was
not
a
business
of
my
own
seeking
or
forwarding
i
found
last
winter
an
edition
would
soon
be
going
on
at
all
events
and
in
contradiction
to
my
wishes
as
i
had
left
these
old
scribblings
to
float
quietly
down
the
stream
of
oblivion
to
their
destined
element
the
ocean
of
forgetfulness
however
i
have
concluded
to
remain
here
this
summer
and
have
them
published
in
a
respectable
manner
and
free
as
possible
from
the
blemishes
imputable
to
the
two
former
editions
over
which
i
had
no
controul
having
given
my
manuscripts
away
and
left
them
to
the
mercy
of
i
am
endeavouring
to
make
the
whole
work
as
worthy
of
the
public
eye
as
circumstances
will
allow
copies
are
to
be
printed
only
but
i
have
a
certainty
from
the
present
popular
frenzy
that
three
times
that
number
might
soon
be
disposed
i
will
attend
to
what
you
direct
on
the
subject
and
will
forward
the
ten
you
mention
by
the
middle
of
july
or
i
will
consider
of
what
you
say
relative
to
the
insertion
of
a
piece
or
two
in
prose
but
suspect
that
anything
i
have
written
in
that
way
is
so
inferior
to
the
poetry
that
the
contrast
will
be
injurious
to
the
credit
of
the
i
feel
much
in
the
humour
of
remaining
here
about
two
years
to
amuse
myself
as
well
as
the
public
with
such
matter
as
that
of
the
fat
man
you
refer
to
and
if
the
public
are
in
the
same
humour
they
shall
be
but
i
am
intruding
on
your
time
and
will
add
no
more
at
i
had
almost
said

my
best
wishes
sir
will
ever
await
you
and
in
particular
that
your
presidential
career
may
be
equally
honourable
though
less
stormy
than
that
of
your
predecessor
it
is
evident
that
freneau
wrote
also
to
jefferson
for
on
may
the
latter
wrote
from
monticello
sir
i
subscribe
with
pleasure
to
the
publication
of
your
volumes
of
poems
i
anticipate
the
same
pleasure
from
them
which
the
perusal
of
those
heretofore
published
has
given
me
i
have
not
been
able
to
circulate
the
paper
because
i
have
not
been
from
home
above
once
or
twice
since
my
return
and
because
in
a
country
situation
like
mine
little
can
be
done
in
that
way
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
are
mostly
industrious
farmers
employed
in
active
life
and
reading
little
they
rarely
buy
a
book
of
whose
merit
they
can
judge
by
having
it
in
their
hand
and
are
less
disposed
to
engage
for
those
yet
unknown
to
them
i
am
becoming
like
them
myself
in
a
preference
of
the
healthy
and
cheerful
employment
without
doors
to
the
being
immured
within
four
brick
walls
but
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
one
of
your
volumes
will
be
a
pleasant
pocket
companion
wishing
you
all
possible
success
and
happiness
i
salute
you
with
constant
esteem
and
respect
the
reply
to
freneau
second
letter
to
jefferson
has
also
been
lost
but
freneau
letter
dated
philadelphia
may
has
escaped
destruction
sir
yesterday
your
letter
dated
may
came
to
perhaps
you
a
little
misunderstood
me
when
i
wrote
to
you
from
this
place
in
april
last
inclosing
the
proposal
paper
respecting
the
i
only
wished
your
name
to
be
placed
at
the
head
of
the
list
and
did
not
wish
you
to
be
at
the
pains
of
collecting
subscriptions
further
than
as
any
of
your
neighbours
might
choose
to
put
down
their
names
indeed
the
whole
subscription
plan
was
set
a
going
without
my
knowledge
or
approbation
last
winter
but
as
i
found
the
matter
had
gone
too
far
to
be
recalled
i
thought
it
best
to
submit
in
the
present
edition
to
the
course
and
order
of
things
as
they
are
and
must
sir
if
there
be
anything
like
happiness
in
this
our
state
of
existence
it
will
be
such
to
me
when
these
two
little
volumes
reach
you
in
august
ensuing
if
the
sentiments
in
them
under
the
poetical
veil
amuse
you
but
for
a
single
this
is
the
first
edition
that
i
have
in
reality
attended
to
the
other
two
having
been
published
in
a
strange
way
while
i
was
wandering
over
gloomy
seas
until
by
the
necessity
of
the
times
and
now
again
i
fear
i
am
reverting
to
the
folly
of
scribbling
verses
that
your
shades
of
monticello
may
afford
you
complete
happiness
is
the
wish
and
hope
of
all
the
worthy
part
of
mankind
and
my
own
in
particular
in
such
the
philosophers
of
antiquity
preferred
to
pass
life
or
if
that
was
not
allowed
their
declining
days
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
read
the
inclosed
verses
they
were
published
early
in
march
last
in
the
trenton
true
american
newspaper
and
in
the
public
advertiser
of
new
york
on
august
freneau
wrote
finally
to
madison
sir
the
two
volumes
of
poems
that
in
april
last
i
engaged
to
have
published
are
finished
and
will
be
ready
for
delivery
in
two
or
three
days
the
ten
setts
you
subscribed
for
i
am
rather
at
a
loss
how
to
have
safely
transmitted
to
you
at
your
residence
in
virginia
where
i
find
by
the
newspapers
you
mean
to
continue
until
the
end
of
september
will
you
on
receipt
of
this
send
me
a
line
or
two
informing
me
whether
you
would
prefer
having
the
books
put
into
the
hands
of
some
confidential
person
here
to
be
sent
or
that
they
be
sent
to
the
post
office
at
washington
or
that
they
be
forwarded
directly
to
yourself
in
orange
county
the
precise
direction
is
not
in
my
power
the
collection
is
the
most
elaborate
of
all
the
earlier
editions
of
freneau
works
his
statement
that
it
was
the
only
one
which
received
his
personal
supervision
is
certainly
wrong
for
he
had
carefully
supervised
the
edition
on
the
title
page
he
announced
that
the
poems
were
now
republished
from
the
original
manuscripts
and
that
he
had
added
several
translations
from
the
ancients
and
other
pieces
not
heretofore
in
print
but
the
new
poems
that
had
not
previously
appeared
in
the
were
very
few
on
the
title
page
also
he
placed
the
stanza
justly
to
record
the
deeds
of
fame
a
muse
from
heaven
should
touch
the
soul
with
flame
some
powerful
spirit
in
superior
lays
should
tell
the
conflicts
of
the
stormy
days
the
poet
advertisement
is
as
follows
the
poems
included
in
these
two
volumes
were
originally
written
between
the
years
and
and
were
partly
published
in
the
transient
prints
of
the
times
and
afterwards
collected
into
two
editions
of
and
the
present
is
a
revision
of
the
whole
and
now
published
agreeable
to
the
terms
of
the
subscription
issued
in
this
city
in
april
last
such
perhaps
as
are
not
attracted
by
mere
novelty
or
amusement
will
attend
more
particularly
to
the
poems
originating
from
the
temporary
events
of
the
american
war
these
poems
were
intended
in
part
to
expose
to
vice
and
treason
their
own
hideous
deformity
to
depict
virtue
honour
and
patriotism
in
their
native
beauty
such
says
a
most
distinguished
foreign
author
was
the
intention
of
poetry
from
the
beginning
and
here
her
purpose
should
end
whether
the
following
verses
have
any
real
claim
to
the
attention
of
the
citizens
of
the
american
united
states
who
may
honour
them
with
a
reading
is
left
for
the
public
to
decide
to
his
countrymen
the
real
the
and
the
rising
generation
who
are
attached
to
their
sentiments
and
principles
the
writer
hopes
this
collection
will
not
prove
unacceptable
a
more
complete
edition
might
have
been
published
so
as
to
include
a
great
number
of
miscellaneous
poems
and
animadversions
on
public
events
down
to
the
present
year
but
it
has
been
judged
most
proper
to
restrict
what
is
now
printed
to
the
date
of
with
the
exception
of
only
a
very
few
pieces
of
later
composition
which
have
been
retained
and
inserted
in
the
body
of
the
work
but
not
so
as
to
materially
interrupt
the
general
tenor
of
the
poems
that
arose
from
the
incidents
of
the
american
revolutionary
contest
the
author
will
only
add
that
to
this
edition
are
prefixed
two
engravings
the
one
representing
tammany
observing
a
hostile
fleet
approaching
his
shores
the
other
a
nocturnal
view
of
captain
jones
engagement
with
the
these
it
is
hoped
will
be
considered
not
inelegant
embellishments
of
the
edition
now
presented
to
the
public
august
the
work
is
divided
into
four
parts
book
i
containing
translations
from
the
ancients
and
other
pieces
on
various
subjects
written
in
america
book
ii
containing
original
pieces
with
some
relative
to
the
more
early
events
of
the
american
revolutionary
war
book
iii
containing
original
poems
written
and
published
at
different
periods
during
the
revolutionary
war
book
iv
consisting
of
miscellaneous
pieces
on
the
events
of
the
times
interspersed
with
others
on
moral
satirical
and
political
subjects
the
author
made
almost
no
attempt
to
arrange
the
material
chronologically
as
to
the
dates
of
composition
he
resurrected
none
of
the
material
dropped
from
the
collection
but
cut
from
the
edition
some
other
poems
among
them
nearly
all
of
the
material
relating
to
the
french
revolution
the
greater
number
of
the
new
year
odes
and
such
fine
pieces
as
neversink
the
country
printer
slender
journey
and
the
wintry
prospect
the
text
was
taken
largely
from
the
version
and
a
few
minor
amendments
and
changes
made
but
in
no
case
were
they
so
frequent
or
so
careful
as
those
made
for
the
second
edition
the
poet
editorial
work
consisted
mainly
in
elaborated
titles
with
latin
quotations
in
and
in
division
of
the
material
into
books
the
next
few
years
of
freneau
life
were
spent
quietly
at
mount
pleasant
he
passed
his
time
as
his
daughter
describes
in
writing
poetry
and
in
answering
and
receiving
letters
her
picture
of
the
man
at
this
period
is
full
of
interest
although
no
farmer
he
loved
to
see
the
work
going
on
he
was
very
fond
of
feeding
poultry
and
all
the
dumb
animals
and
when
the
season
came
for
slaughtering
the
porkers
he
generally
managed
it
so
as
to
have
some
business
in
new
york
and
he
was
usually
absent
when
poultry
was
wanted
for
dinner
freneau
had
to
give
orders
to
the
blacks
to
do
it
privately
he
confessed
it
a
weakness
and
tried
to
conceal
it
his
interest
in
politics
was
still
keen
he
watched
carefully
all
the
premonitory
signs
of
the
approaching
storm
of
and
when
war
was
found
to
be
inevitable
his
harp
was
in
full
tune
to
satirize
the
foe
which
he
had
never
ceased
to
hate
and
to
celebrate
the
heroes
and
the
victories
of
his
country
on
january
we
find
him
again
in
correspondence
with
his
old
friend
madison
sir
since
my
last
return
from
the
canary
islands
in
to
charleston
and
from
thence
to
new
york
with
my
brigantine
washington
quitting
the
bustle
and
distraction
of
active
life
my
walks
have
been
confined
with
now
and
then
a
short
excursion
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
never
sink
hills
and
under
some
old
hereditary
trees
and
on
some
fields
which
i
well
recollect
for
sixty
years
during
the
last
seven
years
my
pen
could
not
be
entirely
idle
and
for
amusement
only
now
and
then
i
had
recourse
to
my
old
habit
of
scribbling
verses
a
bookseller
in
new
york
longworth
by
some
means
discovered
this
and
has
prevailed
on
me
to
put
my
papers
into
his
hands
for
publication
with
some
reluctance
i
consented
to
gratify
his
wish
altho
i
think
after
the
age
of
fifty
or
thereabouts
the
vanity
of
authorship
ought
to
cease
at
least
it
has
been
the
case
with
myself
longworth
informs
me
the
work
will
be
published
early
in
february
in
two
duodecimo
volumes
i
have
directed
him
when
done
to
forward
a
copy
to
yourself
of
which
i
beg
your
acceptance
i
do
not
know
that
the
verses
are
of
any
superior
or
very
unusual
merit
but
he
tells
me
the
town
will
have
them
and
of
course
have
them
they
will
and
must
it
seems
the
work
can
not
be
very
tedious
for
in
two
small
volumes
there
will
be
upwards
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
poems
on
different
subjects
moral
political
or
merely
amusing
and
not
a
few
upon
the
events
of
the
times
since
may
however
you
know
a
short
production
may
sometimes
be
tedious
and
a
long
one
very
lively
and
captivating
none
of
my
effusions
in
these
volumes
much
exceed
two
hundred
lines
and
several
do
not
reach
more
than
the
fourth
part
of
that
number
of
lines
when
i
left
philadelphia
about
the
middle
of
september
the
ten
copies
of
the
revolutionary
poems
which
you
subscribed
for
were
put
into
a
box
well
secured
and
forwarded
according
to
your
direction
under
the
care
of
general
steele
then
collector
of
the
port
of
philadelphia
i
have
not
since
heard
whether
they
reached
you
or
not
that
edition
was
published
by
merely
for
the
benefit
of
and
to
assist
bailey
an
unfortunate
but
deserving
widowed
female
niece
to
general
steele
and
this
consideration
alone
induced
me
to
pay
some
attention
to
that
third
edition
but
in
mentioning
these
matters
i
fear
i
am
intruding
both
on
your
time
and
patience
constantly
or
always
perpetually
engaged
as
you
undoubtedly
are
in
the
duties
of
your
station
at
a
stormy
period
a
tempestuous
presidency
indeed
may
you
weather
all
the
conflicts
of
these
mighty
times
and
return
safe
at
the
proper
period
to
your
virginian
groves
fields
and
streams
sure
i
am
different
very
different
indeed
from
your
long
intercourse
with
political
life
and
the
affairs
of
a
hive
my
best
wishes
attend
yourself
and
madison
to
whom
tho
i
never
had
the
pleasure
of
her
acquaintance
i
beg
you
to
present
my
best
compliments
and
regards
on
march
following
he
writes
again
to
madison
sir
when
i
mentioned
in
my
few
lines
to
you
dated
from
my
residence
in
new
jersey
on
the
of
january
last
the
two
volumes
of
poems
publishing
in
this
city
by
longworth
i
did
really
think
to
have
had
a
small
box
of
them
at
washington
by
the
middle
of
february
at
farthest
with
a
particular
direction
of
a
couple
of
copies
to
yourself
bound
in
an
elegant
manner
finding
however
that
the
business
went
on
slowly
here
and
a
little
vexed
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
leaving
my
solitude
and
the
wild
scenes
of
nature
in
new
jersey
for
the
ever
execrated
streets
and
company
of
this
capital
i
embarked
near
sandy
hook
in
a
snow
storm
about
the
last
of
january
and
shortly
after
arrived
here
fortunately
unnoticed
and
almost
unknown
at
my
time
of
life
abounding
however
in
all
the
powers
of
health
and
vigour
though
i
consider
my
poetry
and
poems
as
mere
trifles
i
was
seriously
out
of
humour
on
my
arrival
here
to
see
my
work
delayed
as
well
from
the
severity
of
the
cold
which
has
been
unremitting
for
more
than
a
month
past
and
perhaps
to
some
other
causes
it
would
not
be
prudent
to
explain
by
my
incessant
exertions
in
spurring
on
the
indolence
of
typography
the
work
such
as
it
is
is
now
finished
in
two
small
volumes
of
about
pages
the
moment
they
are
out
of
the
bookbinder
hands
longworth
will
forward
you
a
copy
and
by
the
first
vessel
to
alexandria
georgetown
or
washington
a
box
of
them
to
his
correspondents
in
these
places
a
copy
or
two
of
the
revolutionary
poems
will
be
forwarded
to
your
direction
i
am
sorry
the
copies
you
had
were
doomed
to
the
flames
but
the
author
had
nearly
suffered
the
same
fate
in
the
year
yesterday
i
received
from
new
jersey
a
copy
of
your
friendly
letter
of
the
february
a
copy
i
say
for
my
wife
or
some
one
of
my
four
girls
daughters
would
not
forward
me
the
original
but
keep
it
until
my
return
for
fear
of
accidents
morning
i
embark
again
for
monmouth
and
among
other
cares
when
i
arrive
at
my
magical
grove
i
shall
hasten
to
exert
all
the
poetical
energy
i
possess
on
the
grand
subject
of
the
repulse
of
the
british
army
from
new
orleans
there
is
a
subject
indeed
far
above
my
power
i
fear
if
there
be
anything
in
inspiration
it
will
be
needful
on
such
a
theme
eight
hundred
lines
in
heroic
measure
i
mean
to
devote
to
this
animating
in
due
time
you
shall
hear
more
from
me
on
this
business
if
i
am
not
anticipated
by
some
one
more
muse
beloved
than
hoping
that
all
health
and
happiness
may
attend
you
and
that
your
libraries
in
future
may
escape
the
ravages
and
flames
of
goths
and
barbarians
i
remain

as
far
as
we
know
to
madison
sir
anna
smyth
the
lady
of
charles
smyth
esquire
a
respectable
citizen
of
this
place
being
to
set
out
in
a
few
days
on
a
tour
to
virginia
and
expecting
to
be
in
your
neighbourhood
either
at
washington
or
at
montpelier
does
me
the
favour
to
take
under
her
particular
care
to
put
or
transmit
into
your
hands
the
two
little
volumes
i
mentioned
to
you
in
my
letter
last
winter
and
to
which
i
received
your
friendly
and
obliging
answer
be
pleased
to
accept
them
as
a
mark
of
my
attention
respect
and
esteem
in
regard
to
your
private
as
well
as
public
character
i
have
written
to
carey
in
philadelphia
there
to
forward
on
to
you
if
he
has
them
the
two
volumes
of
the
revolutionary
poems
published
in
philadelphia
in
the
summer
of
and
which
you
wished
to
regain
since
the
loss
of
your
copies
in
the
conflagration
at
washington
last
year
i
flatter
myself
the
arrangement
i
have
made
with
him
will
replace
them
in
your
i
will
only
add
that
any
attention
paid
by
you
to
smyth
i
will
consider
as
conferred
on
myself
the
edition
contains
no
poems
previously
published
in
the
earlier
collections
the
work
shows
no
falling
off
in
vigor
from
the
earlier
martial
standard
set
by
the
poet
in
his
more
vigorous
years
some
critics
have
declared
that
the
poet
best
work
is
in
this
collection
certain
it
is
that
a
few
of
the
lyrics
of
battle
have
a
spirit
and
swing
that
make
them
notable
productions
freneau
placed
upon
the
the
ringing
challenge
then
england
come
a
sense
of
wrong
requires
to
meet
with
thirteen
stars
your
thousand
fires
through
these
stern
times
the
conflict
to
maintain
or
drown
them
with
your
commerce
in
the
main
he
introduced
the
work
as
follows
the
poetical
pieces
contained
in
these
volumes
were
composed
at
different
periods
and
on
a
variety
of
occasions
between
the
years
and
and
are
now
presented
to
the
public
printed
from
the
author
original
and
corrected
manuscripts
and
it
is
hoped
in
such
a
style
of
typography
as
will
not
be
unacceptable
to
the
several
of
the
performances
comprised
in
this
collection
and
chiefly
those
on
political
subjects
and
other
events
of
the
times
have
heretofore
appeared
in
several
periodical
publications
of
and
other
states
of
the
union
it
is
presumed
however
that
the
poems
of
this
description
will
not
be
the
less
acceptable
to
the
friends
of
the
muses
now
they
are
collected
in
these
volumes
with
the
advantage
of
having
at
one
view
what
were
before
scattered
in
those
bulky
vehicles
of
information
whose
principal
object
can
be
little
more
than
to
record
the
common
events
and
business
of
the
day
and
soon
descend
into
comparative
whatever
may
be
the
fate
of
the
work
they
are
respectfully
offered
to
the
world
in
hopes
it
may
obtain
a
share
of
their
attention
and
particularly
from
the
friends
of
poetical
composition
and
in
a
country
where
it
may
be
expected
the
fine
arts
in
general
will
with
the
return
of
peace
find
that
share
of
encouragement
which
they
seem
entitled
to
demand
in
every
nation
that
makes
any
pretensions
to
refinement
and
it
is
only
necessary
to
add
that
care
has
been
taken
to
execute
the
typographical
part
as
as
possible
the
poems
were
reviewed
for
the
by
gulian
verplanck
who
said
in
part
he
depicts
land
battles
and
naval
fights
with
much
animation
and
gay
coloring
and
being
himself
a
son
of
old
neptune
he
is
never
at
a
loss
when
the
scene
lies
at
sea
his
martial
and
political
ballads
are
free
from
bombast
and
affectation
and
often
have
an
arch
simplicity
in
their
manner
that
renders
them
very
poignant
and
striking
if
the
ballads
and
songs
of
dibdin
have
cheered
the
spirits
and
incited
the
valor
of
the
british
tars
the
strains
of
freneau
in
like
manner
are
calculated
to
impart
patriotic
impulses
to
the
hearts
of
his
countrymen
and
their
effect
in
this
way
should
be
taken
as
the
test
of
their
merit
without
entering
into
a
very
nice
examination
of
the
rhyme
or
the
reason
for
our
own
part
we
have
no
inclination
to
dwell
on
his
defects
we
had
much
rather
full
applause
in
honor
to
his
age
dismiss
the
veteran
poet
from
the
stage
crown
his
last
exit
with
distinguished
praise
and
kindly
hide
his
baldness
with
the
bays
the
last
lines
used
by
verplanck
are
from
american
bards
a
poem
published
in
philadelphia
in
the
reference
to
freneau
is
not
without
interest
let
freneau
live
though
flattery
baleful
tongue
too
early
tuned
his
youthful
lyre
to
song
and
ripe
old
age
in
ill
directed
zeal
has
made
an
enervated
last
appeal
his
song
could
fire
the
sailor
on
the
wave
raise
up
the
coward
animate
the
brave
while
wit
and
satire
cast
their
darts
around
and
fools
and
cowards
tremble
at
the
sound
although
ambition
never
soared
to
claim
the
meed
of
polished
verse
or
classic
fame
and
caustic
critics
honor
but
condemn
a
strain
of
feeling
but
a
style
too
tame
let
the
old
bard
whose
patient
voice
has
fanned
the
fire
of
freedom
that
redeemed
our
land
live
on
the
scroll
with
kindred
names
that
swell
the
page
of
history
where
their
honors
dwell
with
full
applause
in
honor
to
his
age
dismiss
the
veteran
poet
from
the
stage
crown
his
last
exit
with
distinguished
praise
and
kindly
hide
his
baldness
with
the
bays
the
last
years
of
freneau
life
were
eventless
passed
quietly
at
mount
pleasant
and
varied
only
with
frequent
visits
to
new
york
shortly
after
the
issue
of
the
edition
of
his
poems
the
ancestral
home
was
completely
destroyed
by
fire
together
with
most
of
the
poet
papers
manuscript
poems
valuable
letters
and
books
the
collection
of
a
lifetime
during
his
last
years
he
contemplated
a
complete
and
final
edition
of
his
poetical
works
he
wrote
mease
of
philadelphia
whether
there
was
enough
of
the
old
spirit
of
patriotism
abroad
to
insure
the
safety
of
such
an
adventure
and
it
was
the
testimony
of
alexander
anderson
the
once
celebrated
engraver
on
wood
that
freneau
once
consulted
with
him
as
to
the
cost
of
an
illustrated
volume
of
his
poems
and
departed
sadly
remarking
that
his
purse
was
not
equal
to
the
venture
the
best
picture
of
the
poet
in
his
old
age
is
from
the
pen
of
the
genial
john
francis
of
new
york
who
knew
him
well
during
his
last
years
i
had
when
very
young
read
the
poetry
of
freneau
and
as
we
instinctively
become
attached
to
the
writers
who
first
captivate
our
imaginations
it
was
with
much
zest
that
i
formed
a
personal
acquaintance
with
the
revolutionary
bard
he
was
at
that
time
about
years
old
when
he
first
introduced
himself
to
me
in
my
library
i
gave
him
an
earnest
welcome
he
was
somewhat
below
the
ordinary
height
in
person
thin
yet
muscular
with
a
firm
step
though
a
little
inclined
to
stoop
his
countenance
wore
traces
of
care
yet
lightened
with
intelligence
as
he
spoke
he
was
mild
in
enunciation
neither
rapid
nor
slow
but
clear
distinct
and
emphatic
his
forehead
was
rather
beyond
the
medium
elevation
his
eyes
a
dark
grey
occupying
a
socket
deeper
than
common
his
hair
must
have
once
been
beautiful
it
was
now
thinned
and
of
an
iron
grey
he
was
free
of
all
ambitious
displays
his
habitual
expression
was
pensive
his
dress
might
have
passed
for
that
of
a
farmer
new
york
the
city
of
his
birth
was
his
most
interesting
theme
his
collegiate
career
with
madison
next
his
story
of
many
of
his
occasional
poems
was
quite
romantic
as
he
had
at
command
types
and
a
printing
press
when
an
incident
of
moment
in
the
revolution
occurred
he
would
retire
for
composition
or
find
shelter
under
the
shade
of
some
tree
indite
his
lyrics
repair
to
the
press
set
up
his
types
and
issue
his
productions
there
was
no
difficulty
in
versification
with
him
i
told
him
what
i
had
heard
jeffrey
the
scotch
reviewer
say
of
his
writings
that
the
time
would
arrive
when
his
poetry
like
that
of
hudibras
would
command
a
commentator
like
gray
on
some
of
the
occasions
when
freneau
honored
me
with
a
visit
we
had
within
our
circle
one
of
my
earliest
friends
that
rare
knickerbocker
gulian
verplanck
i
need
not
add
that
the
charm
of
my
interview
with
the
bard
was
heightened
by
the
rich
funds
of
antiquarian
lore
possessed
by
the
latter
it
is
remarkable
how
tenaciously
freneau
preserved
the
acquisitions
of
his
early
classical
studies
notwithstanding
he
had
for
many
years
in
the
after
portion
of
his
life
been
occupied
in
pursuits
so
entirely
alien
to
books
there
is
no
portrait
of
the
patriot
freneau
he
always
firmly
declined
the
painter
art
and
would
brook
no
presentiment
freneau
frequent
visits
to
new
york
were
the
chief
solace
of
his
last
years
says
francis
freneau
was
widely
known
to
a
large
circle
of
our
most
prominent
and
patriotic
new
yorkers
his
native
city
with
all
his
wanderings
was
ever
uppermost
in
his
mind
and
in
his
affections
while
in
the
employment
of
jefferson
as
a
translator
in
the
department
of
state
upon
the
organization
of
congress
with
washington
at
its
head
he
had
the
gratification
of
witnessing
the
progress
of
improvement
and
might
have
enjoyed
increased
facilities
had
he
not
enlisted
with
an
indiscreet
zeal
as
an
advocate
of
the
radical
doctrines
of
the
day
freneau
was
nevertheless
esteemed
a
true
patriot
and
his
private
worth
his
courteous
manner
and
his
general
bearing
won
admiration
with
all
parties
his
pen
was
more
acrimonious
than
his
heart
he
was
tolerant
frank
in
expression
and
not
deficient
in
geniality
he
was
highly
cultivated
in
classical
knowledge
abounding
in
anecdotes
of
the
revolutionary
crisis
and
extensively
acquainted
with
prominent
characters
it
were
easy
to
record
a
long
list
of
eminent
citizens
who
ever
gave
him
a
cordial
welcome
he
was
received
with
the
warmest
greetings
by
the
old
soldier
governor
george
clinton
he
also
in
the
intimacy
of
kindred
feeling
found
an
agreeable
pastime
with
the
learned
provoost
the
first
regularly
consecrated
bishop
of
the
american
protestant
episcopate
who
himself
had
shouldered
a
musket
in
the
revolution
and
hence
was
sometimes
called
the
fighting
bishop
they
were
allied
by
classical
tastes
a
love
of
natural
science
and
ardor
in
the
cause
of
liberty
with
gates
he
compared
the
achievements
of
monmouth
with
those
at
saratoga
with
col
fish
he
reviewed
the
capture
of
yorktown
with
mitchell
he
rehearsed
from
his
own
sad
experience
the
physical
sufferings
and
various
diseases
of
the
incarcerated
patriots
of
the
jersey
and
descanted
on
italian
poetry
and
the
piscatory
eclogues
of
sannazarius
he
doubtless
furnished
benjamin
dewitt
with
data
for
his
funeral
discourse
on
the
remains
of
the
american
martyrs
with
pintard
he
could
laud
horace
and
talk
largely
of
paul
jones
with
major
fairlie
he
discussed
the
tactics
and
chivalry
of
baron
steuben
with
sylvanus
miller
he
compared
notes
on
the
political
clubs
of
with
dewitt
clinton
and
cadwallader
colden
he
debated
the
projects
of
internal
improvement
and
artificial
navigation
based
on
the
famous
precedent
of
the
languedoc
canal
the
death
of
freneau
was
a
sad
one
on
the
evening
of
the
of
december
he
had
gone
on
an
errand
to
freehold
some
two
miles
distant
when
he
set
out
to
return
late
in
the
evening
a
fierce
and
blinding
storm
was
in
progress
his
friends
sought
to
dissuade
him
but
he
insisted
on
returning
instead
of
taking
the
long
way
round
by
the
road
he
took
the
usual
short
way
through
the
fields
and
was
soon
lost
in
the
roaring
blizzard
he
circled
into
a
swamp
and
doubtless
after
hours
of
wandering
sank
down
benumbed
and
hopeless
to
be
found
by
his
friends
a
few
hours
later
still
breathing
but
nearly
lifeless
for
the
whispered
tradition
that
he
was
intoxicated
when
he
left
the
town
there
is
no
foundation
the
next
issue
of
the
contained
a
notice
of
his
death
freneau
was
in
the
village
and
started
towards
evening
to
go
home
about
two
miles
in
attempting
to
go
across
he
appears
to
have
got
lost
and
mired
in
a
bog
where
his
lifeless
corpse
was
discovered
yesterday
morning
captain
freneau
was
a
stanch
whig
in
the
time
of
the
revolution
a
good
soldier
and
a
warm
patriot
the
productions
of
his
pen
animated
his
countrymen
in
the
darkest
days
of
and
the
effusions
of
his
muse
cheered
the
desponding
soldier
as
he
fought
the
battles
of
freedom
his
old
friend
john
pintard
wrote
a
biographical
notice
of
the
poet
in
the
york
for
january
in
which
he
dwelt
largely
upon
his
mental
endowments
and
accomplishments
he
was
a
man
of
great
reading
and
extensive
acquirements
few
were
more
thoroughly
versed
in
classical
literature
and
fewer
still
who
knew
as
much
about
the
early
history
of
our
country
the
organization
of
the
government
and
the
use
and
progress
of
parties
the
house
which
freneau
occupied
during
his
last
years
is
still
standing
his
remains
rest
in
the
little
cemetery
at
mount
pleasant
which
recently
in
honor
of
the
poet
has
been
rechristened
freneau
vii
the
personality
of
philip
freneau
if
we
judge
from
contemporary
testimony
and
the
effect
which
his
personal
presence
invariably
exerted
was
a
singularly
winning
one
the
bluff
hearty
old
sailor
breathed
out
and
honesty
with
every
breath
he
was
the
soul
of
honor
and
despite
his
caustic
pen
the
kindest
hearted
creature
in
the
world
all
that
one
of
his
can
remember
of
him
is
that
once
he
took
her
upon
his
knee
and
chided
her
for
having
killed
a
fly
surely
he
said
it
was
not
made
without
some
wise
end
and
its
little
life
was
as
dear
to
him
as
is
yours
to
you
it
reminds
one
of
my
uncle
toby
there
is
a
cheery
optimism
in
many
of
his
poems
a
stanza
like
this
might
have
been
written
by
browning
all
nature
must
decay
is
true
but
nature
shall
her
face
renew
her
travels
in
a
circle
make
freeze
but
to
thaw
sleep
but
to
wake
die
but
to
live
and
live
to
die
his
temperament
was
celtic
he
inherited
with
his
french
blood
a
passionate
love
for
beauty
a
sensuous
dreamy
delight
in
the
merely
poetic
in
the
weird
and
romantic
he
had
not
the
teutonic
stability
he
was
easily
exalted
easily
depressed
he
went
often
to
extremes
he
was
sensitive
to
a
degree
that
made
criticism
a
torture
and
he
was
proud
beyond
all
reason
he
had
been
deeply
touched
by
the
principles
of
the
revolution
he
had
suffered
personally
at
the
hands
of
the
enemy
he
had
followed
paine
in
his
democratic
doctrines
even
to
the
extremes
and
he
tried
to
live
consistently
with
these
exalted
ideals
his
honesty
and
his
ignorance
of
the
world
prevented
him
from
seeing
how
greatly
these
principles
must
be
modified
to
become
of
really
practical
value
his
kindly
heart
made
him
a
fierce
foe
to
all
kinds
of
tyranny
and
oppression
he
saw
sights
in
the
west
indies
that
made
him
a
bitter
opponent
of
human
slavery
again
and
again
in
his
poems
and
prose
sketches
does
he
condemn
the
evil
his
message
is
almost
as
intense
as
whittier
o
come
the
time
and
haste
the
day
when
man
shall
man
no
longer
crush
when
reason
shall
enforce
her
sway
nor
these
fair
regions
raise
the
blush
where
still
the
african
complains
and
mourns
his
yet
unbroken
chains
not
only
slavery
but
every
other
form
of
oppression
and
wrong
received
his
condemnation
he
wrote
boldly
against
intemperance
in
a
day
when
the
use
of
intoxicating
liquors
was
universal
and
wholly
uncriticised
he
spoke
eloquently
on
cruelty
to
animals
and
he
was
one
of
the
earliest
to
demand
equal
rights
for
man
and
woman
freneau
religious
inclinations
have
been
sometimes
harshly
criticised
by
those
of
puritanic
creed
the
school
of
dwight
could
speak
of
him
only
in
contempt
yet
it
is
true
that
the
poet
was
a
deeply
religious
man
his
love
of
freedom
and
his
perfect
sincerity
affected
his
creed
he
had
an
intense
dislike
for
hollow
formalism
in
his
jamaica
funeral
he
has
pictured
a
hypocritical
priest
in
colors
as
vivid
almost
as
chaucer
he
detested
the
holy
man
by
bishops
holy
made
he
loved
sincerity
and
the
creed
that
came
not
from
dry
formalism
but
from
reason
and
from
an
honest
heart
it
has
often
been
overlooked
by
his
critics
that
freneau
was
a
widely
read
and
thoroughly
cultured
man
that
he
was
a
linguist
of
more
than
ordinary
powers
and
that
he
knew
intimately
the
chief
writings
in
latin
italian
french
and
english
he
was
no
ignorant
careless
scribbler
tossing
into
the
ephemeral
columns
of
the
press
hasty
rhymes
of
which
he
never
thought
again
he
revised
and
corrected
with
patient
care
and
he
took
a
deep
interest
in
the
children
of
his
pen
rescuing
at
one
time
or
another
almost
every
one
of
them
from
the
oblivion
of
the
newspaper
viii
as
to
the
absolute
literary
value
of
freneau
literary
remains
there
is
room
for
honest
difference
of
opinion
he
is
certainly
not
if
we
judge
him
from
what
he
actually
produced
a
great
poet
but
he
must
in
fairness
be
viewed
against
the
background
of
his
age
and
his
environment
nature
had
equipped
him
as
she
has
equipped
few
other
men
he
had
the
poet
creative
imagination
he
had
an
exquisite
sense
of
the
beautiful
and
he
had
a
realization
of
his
own
poetic
endowments
that
kept
him
during
a
long
life
constantly
true
to
the
muse
scarcely
a
month
went
by
in
all
his
life
from
his
early
boyhood
that
was
not
marked
by
poetic
composition
few
poets
even
in
later
and
more
auspicious
days
have
devoted
their
lives
more
assiduously
to
song
freneau
was
the
first
to
catch
what
may
be
called
the
new
poetic
impulse
in
america
the
new
epic
note
previous
to
the
revolutionary
era
america
was
destitute
even
of
the
germs
of
an
original
literature
before
she
could
produce
anything
really
strong
and
individual
there
was
necessary
some
great
primal
impulse
that
should
stir
mightily
the
whole
people
that
should
strike
from
their
hands
the
old
books
and
the
old
models
that
should
arouse
them
to
a
true
realization
of
themselves
and
that
should
clear
the
atmosphere
for
a
new
and
broader
view
of
human
life
such
new
forces
are
always
needed
by
society
but
they
stalk
with
long
strides
over
the
centuries
in
america
such
an
upheaval
was
near
at
hand
it
came
with
appalling
suddenness
the
colonists
had
had
no
gradual
preparation
for
the
idea
of
separation
from
england
as
late
as
franklin
declared
before
the
house
of
commons
that
in
all
of
his
journeyings
up
and
down
the
colonies
he
had
not
heard
expressed
one
single
wish
for
complete
independence
even
after
concord
and
bunker
hill
freneau
the
radical
could
write
long
may
britannia
rule
our
hearts
again
rule
as
she
ruled
in
george
the
second
reign
the
idea
of
independence
came
all
in
a
moment
but
once
it
had
come
it
went
with
leaps
and
bounds
to
its
extreme
never
in
all
history
has
a
whole
people
been
lifted
by
such
rapid
stages
into
a
region
of
such
vast
outlook
we
can
trace
the
growth
of
the
new
spirit
not
decade
by
decade
but
month
by
month
justice
freedom
independence
and
then
the
radiant
vision
of
perfect
liberty
and
the
rights
of
man
and
then
like
a
torrent
the
sense
of
boundless
possibilities
and
glorious
destiny
no
utica
contracts
our
powers
but
the
whole
boundless
continent
is
ours
the
soul
of
man
stirred
by
such
ideals
and
successful
in
realizing
them
beyond
all
dreams
struggled
for
utterance
it
is
such
upheavals
in
human
society
that
make
poets
and
bring
outbursts
of
song
and
periods
in
the
history
of
literature
but
there
was
no
burst
of
song
in
america
instead
there
followed
one
of
the
most
pathetic
spectacles
in
all
literary
history
a
people
with
a
vision
that
transported
them
into
the
clouds
yet
powerless
through
environment
and
early
education
to
transmute
that
vision
into
song
the
south
thrilled
by
the
new
spirit
turned
it
at
once
into
action
and
took
the
leadership
in
war
and
statesmanship
new
england
lifted
up
her
voice
but
she
could
speak
only
through
the
medium
of
old
spiritual
conceptions
and
poetic
forms
a
young
connecticut
parson
thrilled
through
and
through
pours
his
enthusiasm
into
an
epic
of
the
wars
of
joshua
done
in
the
heroics
of
pope
a
brilliant
boston
lad
would
sing
of
war
and
washington
but
he
must
set
it
to
the
tune
of
dryden
and
a
gifted
connecticut
satirist
overflowing
with
the
true
poetic
spirit
is
content
simply
to
add
new
american
stanzas
to
hudibras
with
all
her
rhymers
and
all
her
inspiration
new
england
gave
forth
not
a
single
original
note
it
was
the
repeating
of
the
old
spectacle
of
a
heavenly
anthem
sung
unto
shepherds
unto
those
utterly
unable
to
give
it
utterance
we
see
them
however
struggling
heroically
with
the
burden
from
when
dwight
completed
his
conquest
of
canaan
the
first
piece
of
this
kind
ever
attempted
in
this
country
as
he
observed
in
his
preface
until
which
ends
the
period
with
barlow
columbiad
the
polyolbion
of
american
poetry
the
years
are
strewn
thick
with
the
wrecks
of
epics
every
poet
of
the
era
felt
his
soul
burn
with
the
epic
fire
charles
brockden
brown
when
only
sixteen
had
started
no
less
than
three
of
these
homeric
efforts
one
on
the
discovery
of
america
and
one
each
on
the
conquests
of
mexico
and
peru
it
was
our
heroic
era
but
it
yielded
almost
nothing
of
value
mere
exaltation
availeth
little
unless
it
be
grounded
either
upon
genius
or
culture
america
however
was
not
without
her
genius
before
dwight
and
barlow
and
trumbull
had
written
a
line
freneau
at
princeton
was
planning
epics
american
in
scene
and
spirit
he
had
dreamed
over
his
virgil
of
a
greater
aeneas
who
had
sailed
into
the
pathless
west
to
discover
a
new
world
and
to
plant
there
the
seeds
of
a
greater
than
rome
he
had
translated
with
beating
heart
the
words
of
seneca
the
time
shall
come
when
numerous
years
are
past
when
ocean
shall
unloose
the
bands
of
things
and
an
extended
region
rise
at
last
and
typhis
shall
disclose
the
mighty
land
far
far
away
where
none
have
rov
before
nor
shall
the
world
remotest
region
be
gibraltar
rock
or
thule
savage
shore
fired
at
the
theme
he
had
mapped
out
the
epic
of
a
new
world
but
his
work
of
this
era
like
all
schoolboy
epics
had
resulted
only
in
fragments
which
were
to
strew
his
earlier
volumes
how
strong
and
original
was
this
youthful
dream
one
can
judge
from
the
ringing
lines
of
columbus
to
ferdinand
discovery
and
the
pictures
of
columbus
which
are
mere
epic
fragments
there
is
an
originality
and
a
fire
in
them
utterly
new
in
american
poetry
there
is
poetry
of
a
high
order
in
such
a
climax
as
that
recording
the
soliloquy
of
the
dying
columbus
beginning
the
winds
blow
high
one
other
world
remains
once
more
without
a
guide
i
find
the
way
but
commencement
was
at
hand
here
was
a
chance
indeed
here
was
a
theme
commensurate
with
the
occasion
the
two
young
dreamers
would
outline
an
epic
poem
they
would
essay
things
unattempted
yet
in
prose
or
rhyme
now
shall
the
adventurous
muse
attempt
a
theme
more
new
more
noble
and
more
flush
of
fame
than
all
that
went
before
never
was
graduating
exercise
based
on
broader
foundations
the
young
graduates
bewail
at
every
step
their
limitations
of
space
the
plan
they
suggest
is
the
plan
of
a
columbiad
they
would
begin
with
all
the
tale
of
columbus
they
would
rehearse
the
story
of
cortez
and
pizarro
they
would
discuss
at
learned
length
the
origin
and
the
characteristics
of
the
indians
they
would
tell
the
story
of
the
early
colonies
and
would
trace
the
course
of
settlement
and
review
the
progress
and
the
promise
of
agriculture
and
commerce
they
would
peer
into
the
future
and
mark
the
time
when
we
shall
spread
dominion
from
the
north
and
south
and
west
far
from
the
atlantic
to
pacific
shores
and
shackle
half
the
convex
of
the
main
but
alas
the
time
an
epic
can
not
be
condensed
into
a
graduation
exercise
suddenly
the
poet
bursts
into
true
prophetic
rapture
i
see
i
see
a
thousand
kingdoms
rais
cities
and
men
as
sand
upon
the
ocean
shore
th
ohio
then
shall
glide
by
many
a
town
of
note
and
where
the
mississippi
stream
by
forests
shaded
now
runs
weeping
on
nations
shall
grow
and
states
not
less
in
fame
than
greece
and
rome
of
old
we
too
shall
boast
our
alexanders
pompeys
heroes
kings
that
in
the
womb
of
time
yet
dormant
lye
waiting
the
joyful
hour
of
life
and
light
o
snatch
us
hence
ye
muses
to
those
days
when
through
the
veil
of
dark
antiquity
our
sons
shall
hear
of
us
as
things
remote
that
blossom
in
the
morn
of
days
alas
how
could
i
weep
that
we
were
born
so
soon
in
the
beginning
of
more
happy
times
it
is
not
a
great
poem
when
we
measure
it
by
absolute
standards
but
the
rising
glory
of
america
is
a
very
great
poem
if
we
view
it
in
connection
with
the
conditions
and
the
environment
that
produced
it
full
as
it
is
of
latin
influence
and
commencement
day
zeal
it
is
the
first
real
poem
that
america
ever
made
the
first
poem
that
was
impelled
hot
from
a
man
soul
it
is
more
than
this
it
is
the
first
real
fruit
of
a
new
influence
in
the
world
of
letters
the
first
literary
product
of
that
mighty
force
that
was
to
set
in
motion
the
american
and
french
revolutions
with
all
that
they
mean
in
human
history
america
should
have
recognized
this
new
and
original
voice
and
should
have
encouraged
it
to
sing
the
new
message
which
it
had
to
proclaim
to
the
world
but
she
was
not
yet
ready
how
the
young
dreamer
who
had
seen
life
from
his
earliest
years
only
through
the
medium
of
his
books
was
gradually
disillusioned
we
have
endeavored
to
show
his
first
book
put
forth
in
the
enthusiasm
of
inexperience
with
his
name
on
the
was
damned
by
all
good
and
judicious
judges
so
was
wordsworth
so
have
been
the
earliest
ventures
of
every
innovator
in
the
field
of
song
gradually
the
young
poet
awoke
to
a
realization
of
his
position
america
was
unprepared
for
her
prophet
she
would
not
listen
the
discovery
disheartened
him
his
celtic
temperament
would
not
patiently
wait
for
recognition
as
did
wordsworth
he
was
too
proud
to
force
his
poetry
upon
an
unwilling
public
he
would
leave
the
scene
for
three
years
to
dwell
in
the
dreamy
seclusion
of
the
tropic
islands
this
was
his
period
of
pure
invention
where
he
showed
the
possibilities
of
his
genius
with
the
house
of
night
he
became
one
of
the
earliest
pioneers
in
that
region
which
was
soon
to
be
exploited
by
coleridge
and
poe
the
poem
is
the
first
distinctly
romantic
note
heard
in
america
moreover
one
may
search
in
vain
in
the
english
poetry
of
the
early
romantic
movement
for
anything
that
can
equal
it
in
strength
of
conception
in
mastery
of
weird
epithet
and
in
sustained
command
over
the
vaguely
terrible
the
page
that
recounts
the
poet
departure
from
the
house
of
night
quaking
with
fear
beneath
my
feet
substantial
darkness
lay
and
screams
were
heard
from
the
distempered
ground
his
timid
look
behind
him
to
find
the
windows
of
the
infernal
dome
a
flaming
the
fearful
shrieks
of
the
dying
monster
within
the
walls
the
wandering
light
that
led
him
to
the
graves
the
sudden
peal
of
the
iron
bell
above
him
in
the
darkness
and
then
the
troop
of
spectres
galloping
fiercely
on
death
horses
while
their
busy
eyes
shot
terror
to
my
soul
all
this
is
worthy
of
poe
as
a
product
of
pure
imagination
the
poem
is
most
remarkable
especially
when
we
view
it
in
connection
with
the
english
literature
of
its
day
in
its
weird
supernaturalism
it
anticipated
scott
and
in
its
unearthly
atmosphere
it
clearly
anticipated
coleridge
in
the
jamaica
funeral
the
poet
outlined
his
early
philosophy
of
life
he
was
fast
breaking
from
the
influence
of
gray
his
early
master
it
is
a
gallic
philosophy
that
he
outlines
he
is
becoming
infected
with
deism
he
is
a
true
bacchanalian
is
there
not
a
ring
of
the
rubaiyat
in
a
stanza
like
this
count
all
the
trees
that
crown
jamaica
hills
count
all
the
stars
that
through
the
heavens
you
see
count
every
drop
that
the
wide
ocean
fills
then
count
the
pleasures
bacchus
yields
to
me
freneau
early
dream
of
a
purely
poetic
career
was
rudely
broken
by
the
sudden
clash
of
war
and
by
the
sternly
practical
nature
of
the
american
people
circumstances
decided
for
him
his
career
there
was
needed
a
poetic
voice
to
arouse
the
common
people
to
action
there
was
no
demand
for
an
imaginative
creator
for
a
sensuous
singer
of
love
and
wine
america
needed
a
popular
voice
one
that
could
be
understood
by
the
unlettered
one
that
with
satire
and
patriotic
appeal
could
arouse
and
fire
the
land
freneau
laid
aside
for
a
time
the
harp
and
the
lyre
and
took
up
the
trumpet
and
the
bagpipes
and
of
his
influence
on
the
stormy
period
of
the
revolution
there
can
be
no
two
opinions
his
ballads
and
satires
were
scattered
far
and
wide
they
were
sold
in
broadsides
in
every
port
and
city
and
camp
even
in
the
war
of
his
poems
flew
like
leaves
everywhere
that
men
were
gathered
together
to
be
the
lyrist
of
a
righteous
revolution
and
above
all
to
be
the
poet
is
in
itself
no
small
distinction
his
poems
of
the
war
are
in
themselves
a
running
history
of
the
struggle
especially
of
its
last
years
his
heart
was
in
his
work
the
prison
ship
had
blotted
for
a
time
all
memories
of
the
old
criticisms
of
his
early
work
all
his
early
dreams
everything
save
the
insulting
foe
who
was
making
desolate
his
dear
mother
land
he
lampooned
without
mercy
clinton
cornwallis
carleton
and
the
royalist
printers
rivington
and
gaine
he
sang
tender
lyrics
of
the
patriot
dead
at
eutaw
springs
who
saw
their
injured
country
woe
the
flaming
town
the
wasted
field
then
rushed
to
meet
the
insulting
foe
they
took
the
spear
but
left
the
shield
he
sang
peans
of
victory
over
the
downfall
at
yorktown
he
exalted
the
fame
of
washington
he
called
down
maledictions
on
the
ship
that
bore
the
worthless
arnold
from
american
shores
these
are
more
than
the
fleeting
voices
of
a
newspaper
muse
they
are
true
poems
and
they
are
american
to
the
core
scott
declared
that
eutaw
springs
was
as
fine
a
thing
as
there
is
of
the
kind
in
the
language
with
a
few
fiery
songs
he
placed
himself
at
the
head
of
the
small
group
of
naval
lyrists
a
position
which
even
he
has
not
wholly
lost
in
dash
and
fire
in
ability
to
catch
and
reproduce
the
odors
and
the
atmosphere
of
the
ocean
in
enthusiasm
and
excitement
that
is
contagious
and
that
plunges
the
reader
at
once
into
the
heart
of
the
action
and
in
glowing
patriotism
that
makes
the
poems
national
hymns
no
american
poet
has
excelled
this
earliest
singer
of
the
american
ocean
no
true
patriot
can
read
without
a
thrill
of
pride
such
songs
as
captain
invitation
and
the
death
of
captain
biddle
a
song
of
the
intrepid
seaman
who
from
the
poured
death
into
the
british
ship
tremendous
flash
and
hark
the
ball
drives
through
old
yarmouth
flames
and
all
and
then
in
a
fatal
moment
was
blown
up
by
his
own
magazine
and
stanzas
on
the
new
frigate
alliance
the
gallant
ship
who
walks
the
ocean
like
its
queen
and
barney
victory
over
the
general
monk
that
rollicking
song
of
battle
and
of
triumph
and
best
of
all
perhaps
the
sailor
invitation
which
is
full
of
the
very
salt
and
vigor
of
the
western
seas
the
memorable
victory
of
paul
jones
written
when
america
was
ringing
with
the
first
news
of
the
battle
is
one
of
the
glories
of
american
literature
longfellow
or
whittier
never
wrote
a
more
stirring
ballad
it
moves
with
leaps
and
bounds
it
is
full
of
the
very
spirit
of
battle
she
felt
the
fury
of
her
ball
down
prostrate
down
the
britons
fall
the
decks
are
strew
with
slain
jones
to
the
foe
his
vessel
lash
and
while
the
black
artillery
loud
thunders
shook
the
main
it
is
not
impertinent
to
observe
that
thomas
campbell
was
but
four
years
of
age
when
this
appeared
it
was
not
scott
or
cooper
who
added
the
domain
of
the
ocean
to
literature
it
was
freneau
his
books
are
full
of
the
roar
and
the
sweep
of
the
open
sea
which
he
knew
as
the
farmer
knows
his
ancestral
acres
there
is
no
more
true
and
vigorous
picture
of
an
ocean
voyage
and
a
naval
combat
than
that
contained
in
canto
i
of
the
british
prison
ship
the
episode
of
the
boatswain
fiery
prayer
just
before
the
conflict
is
unique
in
literature
the
war
over
freneau
would
return
to
his
dream
he
would
pour
forth
the
poetic
message
that
was
in
him
but
his
countrymen
delighting
in
his
hard
blows
and
biting
sarcasm
refused
to
listen
to
the
merely
poetic
they
demanded
jingles
and
clever
hits
the
poet
turned
fiercely
upon
them
for
men
i
keep
a
pen
he
cried
for
dogs
a
cane
the
time
for
using
the
cane
was
past
he
would
use
it
no
more
but
who
would
listen
to
anything
that
was
not
rant
and
bombast
fate
had
thrown
him
into
a
clime
a
wave
of
the
old
bitterness
swept
over
him
expect
not
in
these
times
of
rude
renown
that
verse
like
yours
will
have
the
chance
to
please
no
taste
for
plaintive
elegy
is
known
nor
lyric
ode
none
care
for
things
like
these
how
he
at
length
deliberately
turned
from
the
muse
of
his
choice
and
how
after
a
long
experience
with
the
world
of
actual
affairs
he
exchanged
his
old
poetic
ideals
for
those
of
mere
reason
and
common
sense
we
have
attempted
to
show
here
was
a
man
equipped
by
nature
for
a
true
poet
a
man
with
a
message
yet
dwarfed
and
transformed
by
his
environment
america
was
not
ready
for
her
singer
it
took
half
a
century
more
to
make
way
in
the
wilderness
for
the
new
message
that
had
been
whispered
to
freneau
in
his
young
manhood
had
he
been
a
great
he
would
have
been
heard
despite
all
difficulties
he
would
have
trampled
down
the
barriers
about
him
and
have
compelled
his
age
to
listen
but
the
task
was
beyond
him
america
to
this
day
has
produced
no
poet
who
and
alone
could
have
performed
such
a
labor
of
hercules
sadly
freneau
turned
to
other
things
he
has
never
been
adequately
recognized
had
the
first
edition
of
his
poems
published
the
same
year
as
the
kilmarnock
edition
of
burns
been
an
english
book
it
long
ago
would
have
figured
largely
in
the
histories
of
the
romantic
and
naturalistic
movement
which
made
possible
the
great
outburst
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
freneau
was
the
most
conspicuous
pioneer
in
the
dim
romantic
world
that
was
to
be
explored
by
coleridge
and
poe
we
have
already
shown
that
he
was
a
pioneer
in
the
movement
that
succeeded
in
throwing
off
the
chain
forged
by
pope
is
evident
to
any
one
who
will
examine
his
early
work
the
wild
honey
suckle
for
instance
which
was
written
in
twelve
years
before
the
lyrical
ballads
is
as
spontaneous
and
as
free
from
pope
as
anything
written
by
wordsworth
it
is
a
nature
lyric
written
with
the
eye
upon
the
object
without
recollection
of
other
poetry
and
it
draws
from
the
humble
flower
a
lesson
for
humanity
in
the
true
wordsworthian
manner
before
freneau
american
poetry
had
been
full
of
the
eglantine
the
yew
the
babylonian
willow
the
lark
the
flora
and
fauna
of
the
hebrew
and
british
bards
in
our
poet
we
find
for
the
first
time
the
actual
life
of
the
american
forest
and
field
the
wild
pink
the
elm
the
wild
honeysuckle
the
pumpkin
the
blackbird
the
squirrel
the
partridge
the
loquacious
and
in
addition
to
this
the
varied
life
of
the
american
tropic
islands
we
find
for
the
first
time
examples
of
that
true
poetic
spirit
that
can
find
inspiration
in
humble
and
even
vulgar
things
that
furthermore
can
draw
from
lowly
nature
and
her
commonplaces
deep
lessons
for
human
life
freneau
sees
the
reflection
of
the
stars
in
the
bosom
of
the
river
but
when
the
tide
had
ebbed
away
the
scene
fantastic
with
it
fled
a
bank
of
mud
around
me
lay
and
on
the
river
bed
and
from
this
he
draws
the
obvious
moral
for
human
life
consider
what
pope
would
have
said
of
mud
indeed
to
appreciate
freneau
one
must
come
to
him
after
a
careful
reading
of
the
classic
poets
who
preceded
him
what
a
shock
to
this
school
would
have
been
the
vividly
realistic
poem
on
logtown
just
how
much
freneau
influenced
the
school
of
poets
who
in
england
broke
away
from
the
trammels
of
the
eighteenth
century
we
can
never
know
yet
no
one
can
read
long
in
the
american
poet
and
not
be
convinced
that
his
influence
was
considerable
his
poems
were
known
and
read
freely
in
england
at
the
very
dawn
of
the
critical
period
in
british
poetry
and
their
echoes
can
be
detected
more
than
once
in
his
use
of
his
native
land
and
his
familiar
surroundings
as
a
background
for
art
freneau
discovered
the
poetical
side
of
the
indian
and
thus
became
the
literary
father
of
brockden
brown
cooper
and
the
little
school
of
poets
which
in
the
early
years
of
the
century
fondly
believed
that
the
aboriginal
american
was
to
be
the
central
figure
in
the
poetry
of
the
new
world
to
the
little
real
poetry
that
there
is
in
the
indian
freneau
did
full
justice
but
he
went
to
no
such
absurd
lengths
as
did
eastburn
and
whittier
the
indian
death
song
if
it
indeed
be
his
is
full
of
the
wild
stoical
heroism
of
the
brave
who
is
dying
beneath
the
torture
of
his
enemies
in
the
indian
student
he
has
covered
fully
the
indian
love
for
the
pathless
forest
and
to
the
untamable
wildness
of
his
nature
the
dying
indian
and
the
indian
sum
up
what
is
essentially
poetic
in
indian
legend
and
all
that
is
pathetic
in
the
fate
of
the
vanishing
race
poetry
if
it
is
to
confine
itself
to
the
truth
can
do
little
more
for
the
indian
such
was
philip
freneau
a
man
in
every
respect
worthy
to
bear
the
title
of
the
father
of
american
poetry
he
was
the
first
true
poet
born
upon
our
continent
he
realized
in
his
early
youth
his
vocation
he
gave
himself
with
vigor
and
enthusiasm
to
his
calling
he
fitted
himself
by
wide
reading
and
classic
culture
he
received
the
full
inspiration
of
a
great
movement
in
human
society
he
lifted
up
his
voice
to
sing
but
he
was
smothered
and
silenced
by
his
contemporaries
he
was
all
alone
he
had
about
him
no
circle
of
pleiades
to
encourage
and
assist
he
had
no
traditions
religious
or
otherwise
that
would
compel
silence
he
was
out
of
step
with
the
theology
of
his
generation
he
was
out
of
tune
with
the
music
of
his
day
he
was
beating
time
a
half
century
ahead
of
the
chorus
about
him
the
people
have
to
be
educated
to
revolution
and
america
had
not
yet
learned
to
take
the
initiative
in
things
intellectual
and
æsthetic
she
must
follow
the
literary
fashions
beyond
the
sea
freneau
was
for
breaking
violently
away
from
england
and
for
setting
up
a
new
standard
of
culture
and
literary
art
on
this
side
the
water
can
we
never
be
thought
to
have
learning
or
grace
unless
it
be
brought
from
that
damnable
place
he
cried
but
he
reckoned
without
his
countrymen
not
until
day
did
it
dawn
upon
america
that
it
was
possible
for
her
to
think
for
herself
and
make
poetry
that
did
not
echo
the
english
bards
thus
did
america
reject
her
earliest
prophet
thus
did
she
stop
her
ears
and
compel
him
to
lay
aside
his
lyre
for
the
horn
and
the
bagpipes
freneau
lived
to
see
his
discarded
harp
in
full
tune
in
other
hands
first
in
england
and
then
in
his
own
land
there
is
something
truly
pathetic
in
the
figure
of
the
old
minstrel
who
had
realized
almost
nothing
of
his
early
dreams
and
yet
who
had
been
told
by
the
great
jeffries
that
the
time
would
surely
come
when
his
poems
would
command
a
commentator
like
gray
who
had
been
extravagantly
praised
by
such
masters
as
scott
and
campbell
who
had
written
to
madison
as
late
as
my
publisher
tells
me
the
town
will
have
them
his
verses
and
of
course
have
them
they
will
it
is
pathetic
to
see
this
poet
in
his
hoary
old
age
for
he
lived
until
realizing
that
he
had
been
utterly
forgotten
witnessing
the
triumph
of
the
very
songs
that
had
haunted
his
youth
and
seeing
those
who
had
not
half
his
native
ability
crowned
by
those
who
had
rejected
and
forgotten
him
such
ever
is
the
penalty
of
being
born
out
of
due
time
the
present
age
has
also
been
unjust
to
freneau
it
has
left
his
poems
in
their
first
editions
which
are
now
extremely
rare
and
costly
it
has
scattered
his
letters
and
papers
to
the
winds
it
has
garbled
and
distorted
his
life
in
every
book
of
reference
it
has
left
untold
the
true
story
of
his
career
it
has
judged
him
from
generalizations
that
have
floated
from
no
one
knows
where
but
time
works
slowly
with
her
verdicts
true
merit
in
the
end
is
sure
to
receive
its
deserts

even

not
long
he
languished
in

deep
in

cold

not

decreed
to

saw
him
from
the
abodes
of
bliss
sunk
to
the

abyss
and
bade
a

the

in

find
the

approaching
through

him
living
to

grave
where
three
long
days
in
dark
distress
he
lay
and
oft
repenting
to
his
god
did
pray
the

benign
propitious
to

bade
the

to
neighbouring

repair
instant
the

obey
the

cast
him
safe
on

then
his
past
transgressions
mourn
and
grateful
thus
to
heaven
his
thanks
return
afflicted
from
the
depths
of
hell
i
pray
the
dark
abyss
of
everlasting
shade
my
god
in
mercy
heard
the
earnest
prayer
and
dying
jonah
felt
thy
presence
there
because
i
dared
thy
mandate
disobey
far
didst
thou
plunge
me
from
the
face
of
day
in
the
vast
ocean
where
no
land
is
found
the
mighty
waters
closed
thy
prophet
round
on
me
the
waves
their
utmost
fury
spent
and
all
thy
billows
my
body
went
yet
then
surrounded
by
the
dismal
shade
thus
to
my
maker
from
the
depths
i
said
though
hid
beneath
the
caverns
of
the
main
to
thy
blest
temple
will
i
look
again
though
from
thy
sight
to
utter
darkness
thrown
still
will
i
trust
and
trust
on
thee
alone
with
anguish
deep
i
felt
the
billows
roll
scarce
in
her
mansion

my
frighted
soul
about
my
head
were
wrapt
the
weeds
of
night
and
darkness
mingled
with
no
ray
of
light
i
reached
the
caves
the
briny
ocean
fills
i
reached
the
bases
of
the
infernal
hills
earth
with
her
bars
encompass
me
around
yet
from
the
bottom
of
that
dark
profound
where
life
no
more
the
swelling
vein
supplies
and
death
reposes
didst
thou
bid
me
rise
when
fainting
nature
bow
to
thy
decree
and
the
lone
spirit
had
prepar
to
flee
then
from
my
prison
i
remember
thee
my
prayer
towards
thy
heavenly
temple
came
the
temple
sacred
to
jehovah
unhappy
they
who
vanities
pursue
and
lies
believing

undo
but
to
thine
ear
my

song
shall
rise
for
thee
shall
smoke
the

the

rose
and
left

near

so

prodigious
place
three

were
scant
its

forty

the
fatal
warnings
of
the

so
their
souls
distrest

invest
from

glitter
on

throne
to
him

beneath

to

this
voice
of
fate
who
left
his
throne

costly
robes
of
state
and
his
limbs
a
vest
of
sackcloth
drew
and
sate
in
ashes
sorrowful
to
view
his
lords
and
nobles
now
repentant
grown
with
equal
grief
their
various
sins
bemoan
and
through
the
city
sent
this
loud
decree
with
threatening
back
and
dreadful
penalty

the
evil
they
pursue

curse
the
mischief
that
their
hands
would
do
perhaps
that
god
who
leans
to

still

his

all
in
flame
might
rather
perish
than
belie
his
fame
and
god
own
bolts
the
tottering
towers
assail
and
millions
perish
than
his
word
should
fail
then
to
the
heavens
he
sent
this
peevish
prayer
vain
impious
man
to
send
such
pinings
there
while
yet
within
my
native
land
i
stay
this
would
at
last
reward
my
toil
i
said
destruction
through
the
assyrian
streets
to
cry
and
then
the
event
my
mission
falsify
for
this
i
strove
to
shun
thy
sight
before
and
sought
repose
upon
a
foreign
shore
i
knew
thou
wert
so
gracious
and
so
kind
such
mercy
sways
thy
all
creating
mind
averse
thy
bolts
of
vengeance
to
employ
and
still
relenting
when
you
destroy
that
when
i
had
declar
thy
sacred
will
thou
not
what
i
prophesy
fulfil
but
leave
me
thus
to
scorn
contempt
and
shame
a
lying
prophet
blasted
in
my
fame
and
now
i
pray
thee
grant
my
last
request
o
take
my
life
so
wretched
and
unblest
if
here
i
stay
is
but
to
grieve
and
sigh
then
take
my
life
is
better
far
to
die
is
it
thy
place
to
swell
with
rage
and
pride
thus
to
his
pining
prophet
god
reply
say
is
it
just
thy
heart
should
burn
with
ire
because
yon
city
is
not
wrapt
in
fire
what
if
i
choose
its
ruin
to
delay
and
send
destruction
on
some
future
day
must
thou
for
that
with
wasting
anguish
sigh
and
hostile
to
my
pleasure
wish
to
die
then
jonah
parted
from
the
mourning
town
and
near
its
eastern
limits
sate
him
down
a
booth
he
builded
with
assiduous
care
form
of
the
cypress
boughs
that
flourish
there
and
anxious
now
beneath
their
shadow
lay
waiting
the
issue
of
the
fortieth
day
as
yet
uncertain
if
the
power
divine
or
would
to
mercy
or
to
wrath
incline
meantime
the
leaves
that
roof
his
arbour
shrunk
up
and
faded
sheltered
him
no
more
but
god
ordain
a
thrifty
gourd
to
rise
to
screen
his
prophet
from
the
scorching
skies
high
his
head
aspired
the
spreading
leaf
too
fondly
meant
to
mitigate
his
grief
so
close
a
foliage
his
head
was
made
that
not
a
beam
could
pierce
the
happy
shade
the
wondering
seer
perceiv
the
branches
grow
and
bless
the
shadow
that
reliev
his
woe
but
when
the
next
bright
morn
began
to
shine
so
god
ordain
a
worm
attack
the
vine
beneath
his
bite
its
goodly
leaves
decay
and
wasting
withering
die
before
the
day
then
as
the
lamp
of
heaven
still
higher
rose
from
eastern
skies
a
sultry
tempest
blows
the
vertic
sun
as
fiercely
pour
his
ray
and
beam
around
insufferable
day
how
beat
those
beams
on
jonah
fainting
head
how
oft
he
wish
a
place
among
the
dead
all
he
could
do
was
now
to
grieve
and
sigh
his
life
detest
and
beg
of
god
to
die
again
jehovah
to
his
prophet
said
art
thou
so
angry
for
thy
vanish
shade
for
a

shadow
dost
thou
well
to
grieve
for
this
poor
loss
thou
thy

my

just
the
frantic
prophet

my
last
my
only
comfort
is
deny
the
spreading
vine
that
form
my
leafy
bower
behold
it
vanish
in
the
needful
hour
to
beating
winds
and
sultry
suns
a
prey
my
fainting
spirit
droops
and
dies
away
give
me
a
mansion
in
my
native
dust
for
though
i
die
with
rage
my
rage
is
just
once

the
almighty
deign

does
this
lost
thy
sorrow
swell
so
high
friendly
shade
not
to
thy
toil

due
alone
it
sprouted
and
alone
it
grew
a
night
beheld
its
branches
waving
high
and
the
next
sun
beheld
those
branches
die
and
should
not
pity
move
the
lord
of
all
to
spare
the
vast
assyrian
capital
within
whose
walls
uncounted
myriads
stray

kind
and
herds
untold
that

yon
meads
their
stores
of

should
i
this
royal
city
wrap
in
flame
and
slaughter
millions
to
support
thy
fame
when
now
repentant
to
their
god
they
turn
and
their
past
follies
low
in
ashes
mourn
vain
thoughtless
wretch
recall
thy

the
note
this

rather
to
be
considered
as
a
paraphrase
upon
than
a

versification
of
the
story
of

done
in

year
the
adventures
of
simon
swaugum
a
village
merchant
written
in
preliminary
particulars
sprung
from
a
race
that
had
long
till
the
soil
and
first
disrobed
it
of
its
native
trees
he
wish
to
heir
their
lands
but
not
their
toil
and
thought
the
ploughman
life
no
life
of
ease
is
wrong
said
he
these
pretty
hands
to
wound
with
felling
oaks
or
delving
in
the
ground
i
who
at
least
have
forty
pounds
in
cash
and
in
a
country
store
might
cut
a
dash
why
should
i
till
these
barren
fields
he
said
i
who
have
learnt
to
cypher
write
and
read
these
fields
that
shrubs
and
weeds
and
brambles
bear
that
pay
me
not
and
only
bring
me
care
some
thoughts
had
he
long
while
to
quit
the
sod
in
towns
to
try
his
luck
in
trade
but
then
their
ways
of
living
seem
most
odd
for
dusty
streets
to
leave
his
native
shade
from
grassy
plats
to
pebbled
walks
removed
the
more
he
thought
of
them
the
less
he
loved
the
city
springs
he
could
not
drink
and
still
preferr
the
fountain
near
some
bushy
hill
and
yet
no
splendid
objects
there
were
seen
no
distant
hills
in
gaudy
colours
clad
look
where
you
would
the
prospect
was
but
mean
scrub
oaks
and
scatter

never
swell
the
tide
of

her
topsails
did
unlose
nor

sail
except
in
long
canoes
it
would
have
puzzled
faustus
to
have
told
what
did
attach
him
to
this
paltry
spot
where
even
the
house
he
heir
was
very
old
and
all
its
outworks
hardly
worth
a
groat
yet
so
it
was
the
fancy
took
his
brain
a
country
shop
might
here
some
custom
gain
whiskey
he
knew
would
always
be
in
vogue
while
there
are
country
squires
to
take
a
cogue
laces
and
lawns
would
draw

have

why

his

the
mother
of
a
thousand

hardly
buy
a

why
should
i
excite
the

tear
by
whispering
truths
ungrateful
to
his

still
let
him
travel
on
with
scheming
pate
as
disappointment
never
comes
too
his
journey
to
the
metropolis
and
mercantile
transactions
through

obscure
and

perplexing

a

caught
his

so
it

nothing

all
the

smit
with

with

than
you

to

coarse
callicoes
and
crape
pipes
and
tobacco
ticklenburghs
and
tape
pitchers
and
pots
of
value
not
so
high

he
might
sell

with
pain
now
may
the
cooper
never
see
full

but
still
be
driving
at
an
empty

five
gallons
might
have
mellowed
down

made
the

strut
a
full

higher
five

might
have
prompted
many
a
song
and
made
a
frolic
more
than
five
days
long
five

now
are
lost
and
sad
to
think
that
when
they
leak
no
soul
was
there
to

now
slightly
treated
with
a
dram
each
neighbour
took
his

and
went
to

our

he
with
grief
revolv
strange
notions
in
his
scheming
head
for
losses
such
as
these
thought
he
is
meant
that
goods
are
sold
at

no

these
trading
men
know
what
is
just
is
times
what
they
cost
at
first
so
rigging
off
his

by
light
of

the

began
to

here
stood

catching
the

in

all
was
arranged

snug
by

of

the

stood
all
prepared
for
him
that

sure

by
which
the
man
of

is
taken
as

by

now
from
all
parts
the
rural
people
ran
with
ready
cash
to
buy
what
might
be
bought
one
went
to
choose
a

and
one
a

and
they

of

the

began
to

no

would
purchase
pipe
or

each
shook
his

hung

your

so

no

thus
things
dragg

for
many
a
tedious
day
no

came

nought
but
discontent

through

them
have

the
merchant
said
i
sell
at

per

by
which
is
plain
i
scarce
myself
can
save
for
cent
per
cent
is
just
the
price
i
gave
now
cry
the
squire
who
still
had
kept
his
pence
now
sir
you
reason
like
a
man
of
sense
custom
will
now
from
every
quarter
come
in
joyous
streams
shall
flow
the
inspiring
rum
every
soul
in
pleasing
dreams
be
sunk
and
even
our
socrates
himself
is
drunk
soon
were
the
shelves
disburthen
of
their
load
in
three
short
hours
the
kegs
of
wine
ran
dry
swift
from
its
tap
even
dull

flow
each
saw
the
rum
cask
wasting
with
a
sigh
the
farce
concluded
as
it
was
foreseen
with
empty
shelves
long
trust
and
law
suits
keen
the
woods
resounding
with
a
curse
on

an
empty

sour

hanging
the

here
lies
a
worthy

its

now
no

was
a

dark

about

is
the

of

quitting
my

henceforth
be
mine
the
task
to
moralize
upon
this

we
had
the

so

was
well

epilogue
well
strange
it
is
that

still

if
from

this

i
drew
what

to
you
from
the

this

the

a

written
in

traveller
genius
time
where
are
those
famed
piles
of
human
grandeur
those
sphinxes
pyramids
and
pompey
pillar
that
bid
defiance
to
the
arm
of
time
tell
me
dear
genius
for
i
long
to
see
them
at
alexandria
rises
pompey
pillar
whose
birth
is
but
of
yesterday
with
those
prodigious
fabricks
that
you
see
yonder
distant
plain
upon
whose
breast
old
nile
hath
never
roll
his
swelling
streams
the
only
plain
so
privileg
in
egypt
these
pyramids
may
well
excite
your
wonder
they
are
of
most
remote
antiquity
almost
with
those
hills
that
westward
from
them
rise
was
the
same
age
that
saw
old
babel
tower
aspiring
high
when
first
the
sage
egyptian
architects
these
ancient
turrets
to
the
heavens
rais
but
babel
tower
is
gone
and
these
remain
old
rome
i
thought
unrivall
in
her
years
at
least
the
remnants
that
we
find
of
rome
but
these
you
tell
me
are
of
older
date
talk
not
of
rome
before
they
lopt
a
bush
from
the
seven
hills
where
rome
earth
empress
stood
these
pyramids
were
old
their
birth
day
is
beyond
tradition
reach
or
history
then
let
us
haste
toward
those
piles
of
wonder
that
scorn
to
bend
beneath
this
weight
of
years
lo
to
my
view
the
aweful
mansions
rise
the
pride
of
art
the
sleeping
place
of
death
are
these
the
four
prodigious
monuments
that
so
astonish
every
generation
let
us
examine
this
the
first
and
greatest
a
secret
horror
chills
my
breast
dear
genius
to
touch
these
monuments
that
are
so
ancient
the
fearful
property
of
ghosts
and
death
yet
of
such
mighty
bulk
that
i
presume
a
race
of
giants
were
the
since
these
proud
fabricks
to
the
heavens
were
how
many
generations
have
decay
how
many
monarchies
to
ruin
pass
how
many
empires
had
their
rise
and
fall
while
these
remain
and
promise
to
remain
as
long
as
yonder
sun
shall
gild
their
summits
or
moon
or
stars
their
wonted
circles
run
the
time
will
come
when
these
stupendous
piles
you
deem
immortal
worn
out
with
age
shall
moulder
on
their
bases
and
down
down
low
to
endless
ruin
verging
by
dust
be
seen
and
known
no
more
ages
ago
in
dark
oblivion
lap
had
they
been
shrouded
but
the
atmosphere
in
these
parch
climates
hostile
to
decay
is
pregnant
with
no
rain
that
by
its
moisture
might
waste
their
bulk
in
such
excess
of
time
and
prove
them
merely
mortal
was
on
this
plain
the
ancient
memphis
stood
her
walls
encircled
these
tall
pyramids
but
where
is

where
the
domes
of
egypt
haughty
lords
all
all
are
gone
and
like
the
phantom
snows
of
a
may
morning
left
not
a
vestige
to
discover
them
how
shall
i
reach
the
vortex
of
this
pile
how
shall
i
clamber
up
its
shelving
sides
i
scarce
endure
to
glance
toward
the
summit
it
seems
among
the
clouds

phaon
the
admirer
of
sappho
both
of
the
isle
of
lesbos
privately
forsook
this
first
object
of
his
affections
and
set
out
to
visit
foreign
countries
sappho
after
having
long
mourned
his
absence
which
is
the
subject
of
one
of
ovid
finest
epistles
is
here
supposed
to
fall
into
the
company
of
ismenius
a
traveller
who
informs
her
that
he
saw
the
tomb
of
a
certain
phaon
in
sicily
erected
to
his
memory
by
a
lady
of
the
island
and
gives
her
the
inscriptions
hinting
to
her
that
in
all
probability
it
belonged
to
the
same
person
she
bemoans
she
thereupon
in
a
fit
of
rage
and
despair
throws
herself
from
the
famous
leucadian
rock
and
perishes
in
the
gulph
below
no
more
i
sing
by
yonder
shaded
stream
where
once
intranc
i
fondly
pass
the
day
supremely
blest
when
phaon
was
my
theme
but
wretched
now
when
phaon
is
away
of
all
the
youths
that
grac
our
lesbian
isle
he
only
he
my
heart
propitious
found
so
soft
his
language
and
so
sweet
his
smile
heaven
was
my
own
when
phaon
clasp
me
round
but
soon
too
soon
the
faithless
lover
fled
to
wander
on
some
distant
barbarous
shore
who
knows
if
phaon
is
alive
or
dead
or
wretched
sappho
shall
behold
him
more
as
late
in
fair
sicilia
groves
i
stray

with
the
beauties
of
the
vernal
scene
i
sate
me
down
amid
the
yew
tree

flowers
blooming
round
with
herbage
fresh
and
green
not
distant
far
a
monument
arose
among
the
trees
and
form
of
parian
stone
and
as
if
there
some
stranger
did
repose
it
stood
neglected
and
it
stood
alone
along
its
sides
dependent
ivy
crept
the
cypress
bough
plutonian

near
a
sculptur
venus
on
the
summit
wept
a

cupid
dropt
the
parting
tear
strains
deep
engrav
on
every
side
i
read
how
phaon
died
upon
that
foreign
shore
sappho
i
think
your
phaon
must
be
dead
then
hear
the
strains
that
do
his
fate
deplore
thou
swain
that
the
morning
air
to
those
embowering
trees
repair
forsake
thy
sleep
at
early
dawn
and
of
this
landscape
to
grow
fonder
still
o

persist
to
wander
up

down
the
flowery
lawn
and
as
you
there
enraptur
rove
from

to

from

to

pensive
now
and
quite
alone
cast
thine

upon

its
melancholy
moan
and
if

in

at

came
to

he
lay
on

while
his

of

were
on

dripping
wet

ran
purling
by

never

death
was
in

draught
soon
it
chill
his
boiling

soon
this
glory
of
the
plains
left
the
nymphs

left
the

has
fled
with

reigns

to

eurydicè
of

so
deckt
and

like

of

she
was
the

the

the

o
free
from

this

this

restore
thy

to
my

as
by

fair
verdant
side
in
myrtle
shades
she
roved
along
a
serpent
stung
my
blooming
bride
this
brightest
of
the
female
throng
the
venom
hastening
thro
her
veins
forbade
the
freezing
blood
to
flow
and
thus
she
left
the
thracian
plains
for
these
dejected
groves
below
even
thou
pity
my
sad
pain
since
love
as
ancient
stories
say
forced
thee
to
leave
thy
native
reign
and
in
sicilian
meadows
stray
bright
proserpine
thy
bosom
fired
for
her
you
sought
unwelcome
light
madness
and
love
in
you
conspired
to
seize
her
to
the
shades
of
night
but
if
averse
to
my

the
banished
nymph
for
whom
i
mourn
must
in
plutonian
chambers
rest
and
never
to

take
orpheus
too
his

desire
can

quench
by

in

he

the
insatiate
tooth
of

now
level
with

almost
laid
yet
ere

i
seize
my
humble
theme
from
these
low
ruins
that
his
years
have
made
behold
the
unsocial
hearth
where
once
the
fires
blazed
high
and
soothed
the
traveller
woes
see
the
weak
roof
that
abler
props
requires
admits
the
winds
and
swift
descending
snows
here
to
forget
the
labours
of
the
day
no
more
the
swains
at
evening
hours
repair
but
wandering
flocks
assume
the
well
known
way
to
shun
the
rigours
of
the
midnight
air
in
yonder
chamber
half
to
ruin
gone
once
stood
the
ancient
housewife
curtained
bed
timely
the
prudent
matron
has
withdrawn
and
each
domestic
comfort
with
her
fled
the
trees
the
flowers
that
her
own
hands
had
reared
the
plants
the
vines
that
were
so
verdant
seen
the
trees
the
flowers
the
vines
have
disappear
and
every
plant
has
vanish
from
the
green
so
sits
in
tears
on
wide
campania
plain
rome
once
the
mistress
of
a
world
enslaved
that
triumph
the
land
subdued
the
main
and
time
himself
in
her
wild
transports
braved
so
sits
in
tears
on
palestina
shore
the

more

than

through

the
period
famed
when
first
columbus
touched
these
shores
so
long
unknown
through

toils
famine
and
death
the
hero
forced
his

through

pregnant
with

of

with

the
tale
so
oft
rehearsed
of
atabilipa
by

of

too
conquering
motive
in
the
human
breast
deprived
of
life
which
not

redeem

our

designed
by

for
the
rural
reign

no

we
shed
for

buried
in
a
rocky
cursed
be
that
ore
which
brutal
makes
our
race
and
prompts
mankind
to
shed
their
kindred
blood
but
whence
arose
that
vagrant
race
who
love
the
shady
vale
and
choose
the
forest
for
their
dark
abode
for
long
has
this
perplext
the
sages
skill
to
tradition
lends
no
aid
to
unveil
this
secret
to
the
human
eye
when
first
these
various
nations
north
and
south
possest
these
shores
or
from
what
countries
came
whether
they
sprang
from
some
primæval
head
in
their
own
lands
like
adam
in
the
east
yet
this
the
sacred
oracles
deny
and
reason
too
reclaims
against
the
thought
for
when
the
general
deluge
drowned
the
world
where
could
their
tribes
have
found
security
where
find
their
fate
but
in
the
ghastly
deep
unless
as
others
dream
some
chosen
few
high
on
the
andes
the
general
death
high
on
the
andes
wrapt
in
endless
snow
where
winter
in
his
wildest
fury
reigns
and
subtile
æther
scarce
our
life
maintains
but
here
philosophers
oppose
the
scheme
this
earth
say
they
nor
hills
nor
mountains
knew
ere
yet
the
universal
flood
prevailed
but
when
the
mighty
waters
rose
aloft
roused
by
the
winds
they
shook
their
solid
base
and
in
convulsions
tore
the
deluged
world
by
the
winds
assuaged
again
they
fell
and
all
their
ragged
bed
exposed
to
view
perhaps
far
wandering
toward
the
northern
pole
the
streights
of
zembla
and
the
frozen

where
now
are

mere
dreary

solitude
where

forlorn

this

we

hence
ye

when
through

a

shall
hear
of
us
as

and
dazzle
here
no
more
no

presume
to

the
spirit
of
fair
liberty
vengeance
must
cut
the
thread
and
britain
sure
will
curse
her
fatal
obstinacy
for
it
bent
on
the
ruin
of
this
injured
country
she
will
not
listen
to
our
humble
prayers
though
offered
with
submission
like
vagabonds
and
objects
of
destruction
like
those
whom
all
mankind
are
sworn
to
hate
she
casts
us
off
from
her
protection
and
will
invite
the
nations
round
about
russians
and
germans
slaves
and
savages
to
come
and
have
a
share
in
our
o
cruel
race
o
unrelenting
britain
who
bloody
beasts
will
hire
to
cut
our
throats
who
war
will
wage
with
prattling
innocence
and
basely
murder
unoffending
women
will
stab
their
prisoners
when
they
cry
for
quarter
will
burn
our
towns
and
from
his
lodging
turn
the
poor
inhabitant
to
sleep
in
tempests
these
will
be
wrongs
indeed
and
all
sufficient
to
kindle
up
our
souls
to
deeds
of

the

these
are
the

their

not

for

what

what

that

my

with

i
will
go
to

i
say
and
i
swear
to
the
falls
of

that
elegant
scene
where
all
is
so
pretty
and
all
is
so
green
that
river
passaick
celestial
indeed
that
river
of

no
rivers
now
why
i
would
ask
should
i
puzzle
my
brain
the
nature
of
stars
or
their
use
to
explain
to
trace
the
effects
they
may
have
on
our
earth
how
govern
our
actions
or
rule
at
our
birth
five
years
have
i
been
at
these
studies
and
scanned
all
the
books
on
the
subject
that
sophists
have
planned
i
am
sorry
to
say
yet
it
ought
to
be
said
the
stars
have
not
sent
me
one
rye
loaf
of
bread
not
a
shilling
to
purchase
a
glass
of
good
beer
by
my
soul
it
enough
to
make
ministers
swear
tryphena
may
argue
and
say
what
she
will
i
am
sure
all
my
fortune
is
going
down
hill
dear
girl
if
you
wait
the
planets
are
for
us
your
name
will
scarce
alter
to
tryphena
taurus
tryphena
i
love
you
have
courted
you
long
but
find
all
my
labours
will
end
in
a
song
will
you
play
at
she
said
very
jolly
i
answered
the
play
at
is
all
folly
will
you
play
then
at
whist
she
obligingly
said
i
answered
the
game
is
gone
out
of
my
head
indeed
i
am
weary
i
feel
rather
sick
so
i
leave
you
tryphena
to
win
the
odd
there
a
music
some
talk
of
that
play
by
the
spheres
i
wish
him
all
luck
who
this
harmony
hears
and
the
people
who
hear
it
i
hope
they
may
find
it
is
not
a
music
that
fills
them
with
there
saturn
and
venus
and
jove
and
the
rest
their
music
to
me
is
not
quite
of
the
these
orbs
of
the
stars
and
that
globe
of
the
moon
to
me
i
am
certain
all
play
a
wrong
tune
not
a
creature
that
plods
in
or
ploughs
up
the
dirt
but
from
the
mean
clod
gets
a
better
support
then
farewell
to
mars
and
the
rest
of
the
gang
and
the
comets
i
tell
them
they
all
may
go
hang
i
mean
if
they
only
with
music
will
treat
it
is
not
to
me
the
best
cooked
of
all
meat
they
may
go
where
they
will
and
return
when
they
please
and
i
hope
they
remember
to
pay
up
my
fees
so
i
leave
them
awhile
to
be
cheerful
below
and
away
to
passaick
most
merrily
go
the
month
it
was
august
and
meltingly
warm
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
nor
the
sign
of
a
storm
so
i
jumped
in
the
stage
with
the
freight
of
the
fair
and
in
less
than
a
day
at
passaick
we
well
arrived
at
the
falls
i
procured
me
a
bed
in
a
box
of
a
house
you
might
call
it
a
shed
the
best
of
the
taverns
were
all
so
i
barely
was
lodged
or
rather
encaged
yet
cage
as
it
was
i
enjoyed
a
regale
of
victuals
three
times
every
day
without
fail
there
was
poultry
and
pyes
and
a
dozen
things
more
that
the
damnable
college
had
never
in
store
i
feasted
and
lived
on
such
fat
of
the
place
that
the
college
would
not
have
remembered
my
face
so
long
had
i
fed
on
their
trash
algebraic
indeed
it
was
time
i
went
to
passaick
the
rocks
were
amazing
and
such
was
the
height
they
struck
me
at
once
with
surprize
and
delight
the
waters
rushed
down
with
a
terrible
roar
what
a
pleasure
it
was
to
be
lounging
on
shore
they
now
were
as
clear
as
old
helicon
stream
or
as
clear
as
the
clearest
in
poetry
these
falls
were
stupendous
the
fountains
so
clear
that
another
narcissus
might
see
himself
here
nor
only
narcissus
some
faces
from
the
springs
were
reflected
not
made
up
of
graces
but
now
i
must
tell
you
what
people
were
met
they
were
on
my
conscience
a
wonderful
sett
some
came
for
their
health
and
some
came
for
their
pleasure
and
to
steal
from
the
city
a
fortnight
of
leisure
some
came
for
a
day
and
yet
more
for
a
week
some
came
from
the
college
tormented
with
greek
to
continue
as
long
as
their
means
would
afford
that
is
while
the
taverns
would
trust
them
their
board
of
this
last
mentioned
class
i
confess
i
was
one
for
why
should
i
fib
when
the
mischief
is
done
this
age
may
decay
and
another
may
rise
before
it
is
fully
revealed
to
our
eyes
that
latin
and
hebrew
chaldaic
and
greek
to
the
shades
of
oblivion
must
certainly
sneak
too
much
of
our
time
is
employed
on
such
trash
when
we
ought
to
be
taught
to
accumulate
cash
supposing
i
knew
them
as
pat
as
my
prayers
and
to
know
them
completely
would
cost
me
twelve
years
supposing
i
say
i
had
virgil
by
rote
and
could
talk
with
old
homer
is
not
worth
a
groat
if
with
rabbi
bensalem
i
knew
how
to
chat
where
lies
the
advantage
and
what
of
all
that
were
this
cart
load
of
learning
the
whole
that
i
knew
i
could
sooner
get
forward
by
mending
a
shoe
i
could
sooner
grow
rich
by
the
axe
or
the
spade
or
thrive
by
the
meanest
mechanical
trade
the
tinker
himself
would
be
richer
than
i
for
the
tinker
has
something
that
people
must
buy
while
such
as
have
little
but
latin
to
vend
on
a
shadow
may
truly
be
said
to
depend
old
words
and
old
phrases
that
nothing
bestow
and
the
owners
discarded
ten
ages
here
were
people
on
people
i
hardly
know
who
there
was
mammon
the
merchant
and
japhet
the
jew
there
was
slyboots
the
quaker
whose
coat
had
no
flaps
with
two
of
his
lambkins
as
plain
in
their
caps
in
silks
of
the
richest
i
saw
them
array
but
nothing
was
cut
in
our
mode
of
the
day
they
hung
to
old
habits
as
firm
as
to
rocks
and
are
just
what
they
were
in
the
days
of
george
fox
they
talked
in
a
style
that
was
wholly
their
own
they
shunned
the
vain
world
and
were
mostly
alone
one
talked
in
the
nay
and
one
talked
in
the
yea
and
of
light
in
their
lanthorns
that
no
one
could
see
they
hated
the
crowd
and
they
hated
the
play
and
hoped
the
vain
actors
would
soon
run
away
no
follies
like
that
would
the
preachers
allow
and
tabitha
said
thee
and
rebecca
said
thou
here
was
dullman
the
broker
who
looked
as
demure
as
if
a
false
key
had
unlocked
the
shop
door
he
seemed
to
enjoy
not
a
moment
of
rest
so
unhappy
to
be
far
away
from
his
chest
he
was
all
on
the
fidgets
to
be
with
his
gold
both
honour
and
conscience
he
bartered
or
sold
the
devil
himself
excuse
me
i
pray
old
satan
oh
no
take
it
some
other
way
the
god
of
this
world
had
him
fast
by
a
chain
and
there
let
us
leave
him
and
let
him
here
was
samuel
the
deacon
who
read
a
large
book
though
few
but
himself
on
its
pages
would
look
would
you
know
what
it
was
an
abridgement
of
flavell
a
with
bunyan
whole
war
between
soul
and
the
devil
it
seemed
very
old
and
the
worse
for
the
wear
and
might
last
the
next
century
handled
with
care
but
if
fashions
and
folly
should
not
have
a
fall
i
presume
it
will
hardly
be
handled
at
here
was
nimrod
the
soldier
he
wore
a
long
sword
and
of
course
all
the
ladies
his
courage
adored
two
fringed
epaulettes
on
his
shoulders
displayed
discovered
the
rank
of
this
son
of
the
blade
o
la
cried
miss
kitty
how
bold
he
must
be
papa
we
must
beg
him
to
join
us
at
tea
how
much
like
a
hero
he
looketh
good
me
full
many
a
battle
no
doubt
he
has
stood
and
waded
shoe
deep
through
a
mill
pond
of
mud
what
heads
have
been
sliced
from
the
place
they
possessed
by
the
sword
at
his
side
all
i
hope
for
the
best
then
the
soldier
went
out
to
refresh
at
the
inn
perhaps
he
did
not
if
he
did
it
no
sin
he
made
his
congee
and
he
bowed
to
us
all
and
said
he
was
going
to
liberty
hall
is
certain
he
went
but
certainly
where
i
can
not
inform
and
the
devil
may
care
but
now
to
proceed
in
describing
in
rhyme
the
folks
that
came
hither
to
pass
away
time
there
were
more
that
had
heads
rather
shallow
than
strong
and
more
than
had
money
to
bear
them
out
long
in
short
there
were
many
more
ladies
than
gents
and
the
latter
complained
of
the
heavy
expense
and
some
i
could
see
with
their
splendour
and
show
that
their
credit
was
bad
and
their
pockets
were
low
many
females
were
gadding
i
saw
with
concern
who
had
better
been
knitting
or
weaving
their
yarn
and
many
went
into
passaick
to
lave
whose
hides
were
indeed
a
disgrace
to
the
wave
who
should
have
been
home
at
their
houses
and
farms
not
here
to
be
dabbling
to
shew
us
their
charms
it
would
have
been
better
to
wash
their
own
walls
than
here
to
come
here
to
be
washed
in
the
falls
a
judge
of
the
court
in
the
law
a
mere
goose
here
wasted
his
time
with
a
lawyer
let
loose
their
books
were
thrown
by
so
i
begged
of
the
fates
that
the
falls
of
passaick
might
fall
on
their
pates
this
lawyer
was
ludwick
who
scarce
had
a
suit
and
for
once
in
his
life
was
disposed
to
be
mute
but
was
mostly
engaged
in
some
crazy
dispute
a
cause
against
smyth
b
he
could
never
defend
as
well
might
the
old
one
with
michael
contend
the
road
was
before
him
the
country
was
spacious
and
he
knew
an
old
fellow
called
i
saw
him
demurr
when
they
asked
him
to
pay
with
a
he
scampered
though
his
head
was
profusely
with
meal
one
sorrowful
secret
it
could
not
conceal
that
he
drew
his
first
breath
when
a
two
penny
star
presided
and
governed
this
son
of
the
bar
here
was
pedro
the
parson
who
looked
full
as
grave
as
it
he
had
lodged
in
trophonius
cave
he
talked
of
his
wine
and
he
talked
of
his
beer
and
he
talked
of
his
texts
that
were
not
very
clear
and
many
suspected
he
talked
very
he
talked
with
scalpella
the
wife
then
dwelt
on
her
beauties
and
called
her
his
life
he
ogled
scalpella
and
spake
of
her
charms
and
oh
how
he
wished
to
repose
in
her
arms
he
called
her
his
deary
and
talked
of
their
loves
and
left
her
at
last
a
pair
of
old
gloves
i
was
sorry
to
see
him
deranged
and
perplext
that
no
one
would
ask
him
to
handle
a
text
all
gaped
when
he
spoke
and
incessantly
gazed
and
thought
him
no
witch
but
a
parson
fine
work
did
he
make
of
millennium
i
trow
which
he
told
us
would
come
tho
it
comes
very
slow
when
earth
with
the
pious
and
just
will
abound
and
eden
itself
at
be
found
no
musketoes
to
bite
us
no
rats
to
molest
and
lawyers
themselves
rocked
into
something
like
rest
but
most
of
us
judged
it
was
rather
a
whim
or
at
least
that
the
prospect
was
distant
and
dim
so
i
saw
him
pack
up
his
polemical
gown
to
retreat
while
he
could
from
the
noise
of
the
town
c
he
said
there
was
something
in
falls
he
admired
but
of
constantly
hearing
the
roar
he
was
tired
with
their
damp
exhalations
his
fancy
was
dimmed
he
would
come
the
next
spring
with
his
surplice
new
trimmed
besides
there
were
fogs
in
the
morning
he
said
that
rose
on
the
river
and
muddled
his
head
thus
he
quitted
passaick
deserted
her
shore
and
the
taverns
that
knew
him
shall
know
him
no
more
one
farmer
milhollan
i
saw
him
come
here
almost
at
the
busiest
time
in
the
year
his
intent
might
be
good
but
i
never
could
learn
who
coaxed
him
away
from
his
crib
and
his
barn
each
morning
he
tippled
three
glasses
of
gin
with
as
many
at
least
as
three
devils
therein
he
quarrelled
with
jack
and
he
wrangled
with
tom
scarcely
a
negro
but
wished
him
at
home
he
talked
over
much
of
the
badness
of
times
and
read
us
a
list
of
the
governor
d
crimes
from
which
it
was
clearly
predicted
and
plain
that
his
honour
would
hardly
be
chosen
again
he
fought
with
tim
tearcoat
and
cudgelled
with
ben
and
wrestled
with
sampson
all
quarrelsome
men
i
was
sorry
to
see
him
thus
wasting
his
force
on
fellows
who
kicked
with
the
heels
of
a
horse
tho
strong
in
my
arms
and
of
strength
to
contest
with
the
youths
of
my
age
in
the
wars
of
the
fist
i
thought
it
was
better
to
let
them
pursue
the
quarrels
they
had
than
to
be
one
of
their
crew
i
saw
it
was
madness
to
join
in
the
fray
so
i
left
them
to
wrangle
each
dog
his
own
way
he
spoke
thrice
an
hour
of
his
crop
that
had
failed
and
losses
he
feared
that
would
get
him
enjailed
he
mentioned
his
poultry
and
mentioned
his
pigs
and
railed
at
some
tories
converted
to
excuse
me
retailing
so
much
in
my
rhymes
of
the
chatt
of
the
day
and
the
stuff
of
the
times
is
thus
in
the
acts
of
a
play
we
perceive
all
the
parts
are
not
cast
to
the
wise
or
the
brave
not
all
is
discoursed
by
the
famed
or
the
fair
the
demons
of
dullness
have
also
their
share
statira
in
has
not
all
the
chance
for
hags
are
permitted
to
join
in
the
dance
not
catos
or
platos
engross
every
play
for
clowns
and
must
too
have
their
day
not
the
nobles
of
nature
say
all
that
is
said
and
monarchs
are
frequently
left
in
the
shade
there
must
be
some
nonsense
to
step
in
between
there
must
be
some
fools
to
enliven
the
scene
here
was
doctor
sangrado
with
potion
and
pill
and
his
price
was
the
same
to
recover
or
kill
he
waddled
about
and
was
vext
to
the
soul
to
see
so
much
health
in
this
horrible
hole
he
seemed
in
a
fret
there
was
nobody
sick
and
enquired
of
the
landlord
what
ails
your
son
dick
what
ails
him
said
gubbins
why
nothing
at
all
by
my
soul
said
the
quack
he
as
white
as
the
wall
i
must
give
him
a
potion
to
keep
down
his
gall
there
is
bile
on
his
stomach
i
clearly
see
that
this
night
he
will
vomit
as
black
as
my
hat
here
a
puke
and
a
purge
twelve
doses
of
bark
let
him
swallow
them
all
just
an
hour
before
dark
o
dear
said
the
mother
the
lad
is
quite
well
said
the
doctor
no
no
he
must
take
calomel
it
will
put
him
to
rights
as
i
hope
to
be
saved
or
rather
said
gubbins
you
hope
him
engraved
so
the
doctor
walked
off
in
a
pitiful
plight
and
he
lodged
in
a
they
told
me
that
night
here
were
wives
and
young
widows
and
matrons
and
maids
who
came
for
their
health
or
to
stroll
in
the
shades
here
were
nellies
and
nancies
and
hetties
by
dozens
with
their
neighbours
and
nephews
and
nieces
and
cousins
all
these
had
come
hither
to
see
the
famed
fall
and
you
pretty
sally
the
best
of
them
all
here
was
saunders
the
jockey
who
rode
a
white
horse
his
last
it
was
said
and
his
only
resource
and
the
landlord
was
careful
to
put
us
in
mind
that
hell
and
destruction
were
riding
behind
he
often
had
told
him
do
saunders
take
care
this
swilling
of
gin
is
a
cursed
affair
indeed
and
it
puts
a
man
off
from
his
legs
and
brings
us
at
last
to
be
pelted
with
eggs
the
wit
of
your
noddle
should
carry
you
through
break
your
bottle
of
rum
give
the
devil
his
due
keep
the
reason
about
you
that
nature
designed
and
you
have
the
respect
and
regard
of
mankind
this
steed
of
poor
saunders
was
woefully
lean
and
he
looked
as
we
thought
like
the
flying
machine
and
in
short
it
appeared
by
the
looks
of
his
hide
that
the
stables
he
came
from
were
poorly
supplied
a
bundle
of
bones
and
they
whispered
it
round
that
he
came
from
the
hole
where
the
mammoth
was
found
e
they
stuff
him
with
hay
and
they
crammed
him
with
oats
while
saunders
was
gaming
and
drinking
with
sots
for
the
in
the
shape
of
a
bottle
of
rum
deceived
him
with
visions
of
fortune
to
come
his
landlady
had
on
the
horse
a
so
saunders
had
plenty
of
whiskey
and
pye
he
had
gin
of
the
best
and
he
treated
all
round
care
was
dismissed
and
solicitude
drowned
and
a
reckoning
was
brought
him
of
more
than
three
pound
as
he
had
not
a
groat
in
his
lank
looking
purse
the
landlord
made
seizure
of
saddle
and
horse
scalpella
the
hostess
cried
fly
from
this
room
or
i
sweep
you
away
with
my
hickory
broom
thus
saunders
sneaked
off
in
a
sorrowful
way
and
the
falls
were
his
fall
to
be
beggar
next
the
lady
of
ladies
that
governed
the
inn
was
a
sharper
indeed
and
she
kept
such
a
din
scalpella
and
may
i
remember
the
name
could
scratch
like
a
tyger
or
play
a
tight
game
a
bludgeon
she
constantly
held
in
her
hand
the
sign
of
respect
and
a
sign
of
command
she
could
scream
like
a
vulture
or
wink
like
an
owl
not
a
dog
in
the
street
like
scalpella
could
she
was
a
scalpella
i
am
yet
on
her
books
but
oh
may
i
never
encounter
her
looks
i
owe
her
five
pounds
i
am
that
in
her
debt
and
my
dues
from
the
stars
have
not
cleared
it
off
yet
if
she
knew
where
i
am
i
should
fare
very
ill
instead
of
some
beer
she
would
drench
me
with
swill
i
should
curse
and
reflect
on
the
hour
i
was
if
she
thought
i
had
fixed
on
the
pitch
of
cape
horn
she
would
find
me
scalpella
set
down
what
i
owe
in
the
page
of
bad
debts
due
to
scalpy
and
co
her
boarders
she
hated
and
drove
with
a
dash
and
nothing
about
them
she
liked
but
their
cash
except
they
were
tories
ah
then
she
was
kind
and
said
to
their
honours
you
are
men
to
my
mind
sit
down
my
dear
creatures
i
hope
you
not
dined
she
talked
of
the
king
and
she
talked
of
the
queen
and
she
talked
of
her
floors
that
were
not
very
clean
she
talked
of
the
parson
and
spoke
of
the
she
talked
of
her
child
that
was
singed
in
the
fire
the
tories
poor
beings
were
wishing
to
kiss
her
oh
if
they
had
all
the
stars
would
have
fought
against
cicero
f
she
talked
and
she
talked
now
angry
now
civil
the
tories
themselves
wished
her
gone
to
the
devil
how
i
tremble
to
think
of
her
tongue
and
her
stick
tryphena
tryphena
i
played
the
odd
trick
now
the
soldier
the
ladies
were
struck
and
she
that
can
win
him
will
have
the
best
luck
la
father
said
kitty
observe
the
bold
man
i
will
peep
at
his
phyz
from
behind
my
new
fan
what
a
lace
on
his
beaver
his
buttons
all
shine
in
the
cock
of
a
hat
there
is
something
divine
since
the
days
of
goliah
i
venture
to
lay
there
never
was
one
that
could
stand
in
his
way
what
a
nose
what
an
eye
what
a
gallant
address
if
he
not
a
hero
then
call
me
black
bess
what
a
gaite
what
a
strut
how
noble
and
free
i
ravished
i
ruined
father
good
me
dear
kitty
he
answered
regard
not
his
lace
the
devil
i
see
in
the
mould
of
his
face
cockades
have
been
famous
for
crazing
your
sex
since
helen
played
truant
and
left
the
poor
greeks
and
while
her
good
husband
was
sleeping
and
snored
eloped
with
sir
knight
from
his
bed
and
his
three
things
are
above
me
yea
four
i
maintain
have
puzzled
the
cunningest
heads
to
explain
the
way
of
a
snake
on
a
rock
very
sly
the
way
of
an
eagle
that
travels
the
sky
the
way
of
a
ship
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
and
the
way
of
a
soldier
with
maidens
like
thee
at
length
a
dark
fortnight
of
weather
came
on
and
most
of
us
thought
it
high
time
to
be
the
moon
was
eclipsed
and
she
looked
like
a
fright
indeed
and
it
was
a
disconsolate
night
our
purses
were
empty
the
landlord
looked
sour
i
gave
them
in
a
terrible
shower
scalpella
her
face
was
as
black
as
the
moon
her
voice
was
the
screech
of
a
harpy
or
loon
i
quitted
passaick
that
elegant
place
while
a
hurricane
hindered
them
giving
me
chace
a
an
english
divine
of
considerable
note
who
died
about
a
century
b
william
smyth
esq
before
the
revolution
a
celebrated
lawyer
in
new
york
author
of
the
history
of
new
jersey
and
other
works
afterwards
taking
part
with
the
british
he
was
made
chief
justice
of
lower
canada
he
is
since
c
passaick
village
is
at
present
called
patterson
noted
for
its
unfortunate
manufacturing
d
william
franklin
then
governor
of
new
e
these
two
lines
were
inserted
since
the
first
publication
of
this
poem
in
f
they
fought
from
heaven
the
stars
in
their
courses
fought
against
sisera
freneau
freneau
mentions
in
this
poem
that
it
was
printed
in
new
york
in
september
i
can
find
no
trace
of
it
either
as
a
separate
publication
or
a
contribution
to
a
newspaper
as
far
as
i
can
find
the
poem
is
unique
in
the
edition
of
william
nelson
of
paterson
secretary
of
the
new
jersey
historical
society
believes
that
the
local
allusions
in
the
poem
can
not
be
verified
he
writes
there
were
but
two
taverns
at
the
passaic
falls
at
that
time
one
kept
by
abraham
godwin
the
other
by
james
leslie
godwin
and
three
of
his
sons
went
in
the
american
army
at
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
and
he
died
in
the
service
his
widow
survived
him
and
carried
on
the
tavern
for
a
number
of
years
she
had
an
intolerant
hatred
of
all
tories
in
leslie
was
keeping
a
tavern
at
the
present
passaic
a
few
miles
below
the
passaic
falls
and
he
continued
there
during
the
greater
part
of
the
revolution
i
think
the
character
of
the
wife
is
either
purely
fictitious
or
based
on
the
character
of
some
other
person
moreover
i
do
not
think
passaic
falls
was
ever
a
summer
resort
of
the
character
depicted
in
this
poem
travellers
merely
went
there
to
see
the
falls
occasionally
staying
over
night
but
i
can
not
think
it
possible
that
there
could
have
been
such
a
party
assembled
there
at
one
time
as
indicated
in
the
poem
i
do
not
think
the
two
taverns
together
could
have
accommodated
so
many
people
the
place
was
never
called
village
as
stated
in
the
note
but
was
known
as
totown
bridge
until
when
paterson
was
founded
passaic
village
was
the
name
given
about
forty
years
ago
to
the
present
city
of
passaic
the
only
allusions
in
the
poem
which
have
some
semblance
of
reality
are
the
references
to
kitty
by
whom
is
perhaps
meant
the
daughter
of
lord
stirling
and
hall
the
residence
of
her
uncle
gov
livingstone
near
elizabethtown
there
was
no
such
person
as
i
should
think
that
the
scene
of
the
poem
if
it
has
any
foundation
whatever
in
fact
was
more
probably
laid
somewhere
near
philadelphia
part
ii
the
first
poetic
period
the
first
poetic
period
a
a
in
august
freneau
emerges
from
the
obscurity
which
has
concealed
him
since
the
year
of
his
graduation
at
princeton
and
enters
upon
an
era
of
marvelous
productiveness
for
four
months
poetry
must
have
been
his
one
thought
his
one
occupation
it
was
during
this
period
of
his
life
that
he
did
his
most
spontaneous
and
original
work
a
political
litany

from
british
dependence
but
also
from
a
junto

labour
with
absolute
power

schemes
disappointed
have
made
them
look
sour
from
the
lords
of
the

fight
against
freedom
who
still
follow
on

shall
lead
them
from
the

slight
our

fools

are
waiting

this

of

stout

began
his

here
made

made

mists
fogs

sprung
from

mount
up

strive
to
dim
the
approach
of

but
he
in
triumph
darts
his
piercing
ray
scatters
their
forces
and
pursues
his
way
oft
when
the
husband
did
his
labour
leave
to
meet
his
little
family
at

stretch
in
their

he
saw
each
well

face
his

companion
and
his
youthful
race
perhaps
the
scalp
with
barbarous
fury
torn
the
visage
mangled
and
the
babe
unborn
ripp
from
its
dark
abode
to
view
the

ere

finish
half
she

and
should
we

submit
to
that
our

just

our

by
the
men
of
massachusetts
written

in
why
let
the
stricken
deer
go
weep
the

unwounded
play
for
some
must
write
while
some

so
runs
the
world
away
destruction
waits
my
call
some
demon
say
why
does
destruction
linger
on
her
way
charlestown
is
burnt
and
warren
is
deceased
heavens
shall
we
never
be
from
war
released
ten
years
the
greeks
besieged
the
walls
of
troy
but
when
did
grecians
their
own
towns
destroy
yes
that
the
point
let
those
who
will
say
no
if
george
and
north
decree
it
must
be
so
doubts
black
as
night
disturb
my
loved
repose
men
that
were
once
my
friends
have
turned
my
foes
what
if
we
conquer
this
rebellious
town
suppose
we
burn
it
storm
it
tear
it
down
this
land
like
hydra
cut
off
but
one
head
and
ten
shall
rise
and
dare
you
in
its
stead
if
to
subdue
a
league
or
two
of
coast
requires
a
navy
and
so
large
a
host
how
shall
a
length
of
twice
seven
hundred
miles
be
brought
to
bend
to
two
european
isles
and
that
when
all
their
utmost
strength
unite
when
twelve
a
dominions
swear
to
arm
and
fight
when
the
same
spirit
darts
from
every
eye
one
fixed
resolve
to
gain
their
point
or
die
as
for
myself
true
i
was
born
to
fight
as
george
commands
let
him
be
wrong
or
right
while
from
his
hand
i
squeeze
the
golden
prize
i
ask
no
questions
and
he
tell
no
lies
but
did
i
swear
i
ask
my
heart
again
in
their
base
projects
monarchs
to
maintain
yes
when
rebellion
her
artillery
brings
and
aims
her
arrows
at
the
best
of
kings
i
stand
a
champion
in
my
monarch
cause
the
men
are
rebels
that
resist
his
laws
a
viceroy
i
like
modern
monarchs
stay
safe
in
the
town
let
others
guide
the
fray
a
life
like
mine
is
of
no
common
worth
wrong
by
heaven
that
i
should
sally
forth
a
random
bullet
from
a
rifle
sent
might
pierce
my
heart
and
ruin
north
intent
let
others
combat
in
the
dusty
field
let
petty
captains
scorn
to
live
or
yield
i
send
my
ships
to
neighbouring
isles
where
stray
herds
and
steal
those
herds
away
i
strike
the
women
in
this
town
with
awe
and
make
them
tremble
at
my
martial
law
should
gracious
heaven
befriend
our
troops
and
fleet
and
throw
this
vast
dominion
at
my
feet
how
would
britannia
echo
with
my
fame
what
endless
honours
would
await
my
name
in
every
province
should
the
traveller
see
recording
marble
raised
to
honour
hard
by
the
lakes
my
sovereign
lord
would
grant
a
rural
empire
to
supply
my
want
a
manor
would
but
poorly
serve
my
turn
less
than
an
empire
from
my
soul
i
scorn
an
ample
kingdom
round
ontario
lake
by
heaven
should
be
the
least
reward
i
take
there
might
i
reign
unrivalled
and
alone
an
ocean
and
an
empire
of
my
own
what
though
the
scribblers
and
the
wits
might
say
he
built
his
pile
on
vanquished
liberty
let
others
meanly
dread
the
slanderous
tongue
while
i
obey
my
king
can
i
do
wrong
then
to
accomplish
all
my
soul
desire
let
bullets
set
their
towns
on
fire
may
heaven
if
so
the
righteous
judgment
pass
change
earth
to
steel
the
sky
to
solid
brass
let
hosts
combined
from
europe
centering
here
strike
this
base
offspring
with
alarm
and
fear
let
heaven
broad
concave
to
the
center
ring
and
blackest
night
expand
her
sable
wing
the
infernal
powers
in
dusky
combat
join

the
swift
ball
or
spring
the
deadly
mine
since
is
most
true
tho
some
may
think
it
odd
the
foes
of
england
are
the
foes
of
god
let
bombs
like
comets
kindle
all
the
air
let
cruel
famine
prompt
the
orphan
prayer
and
every
ill
that
war
or
want
can
bring
be
shower
on
subjects
that
renounce
their
king
what
is
their
plea
our
sovereign
only
meant
this
people
should
be
taxed
without
consent
ten
years
the
court
with
secret
cunning
tried
to
gain

assailed
their

the

upstarting

the

decay
ah
how
unlike
the
piercy
of
that
day
thus
spoke
the
great
man
in
disdainful
tone
to
the
gay
peer
not
meant
for
him
alone
but
ere
the
tumults
of
his
bosom
rise
thus
from
his
bench
the
intrepid
peer
replies
when
once
the
soul
has
reached
the
stygian
shore
my
prayer
book
says
it
shall
return
no
more

once
old

hoists
his

swims
before
the
infernal
gale
farewell
to

the

dry

with

a

heaves
up

stone
since
then
this
truth
no
mortal
dares
deny
that
heroes
kings
and
lords
themselves
must
die
and
yield
to
him
who
dreads
no
hostile
sword
but
treats
alike
the
peasant
and
the
lord
since
even
great
george
must
in
his
turn
give
place
and
leave
his
crown
his
scotchmen
and
his
lace
how
blest
is
he
how
prudent
is
the
man
who
keeps
aloof
from
fate
while
yet
he
can
one

make

why
my
friends
these
hard
reflections
still
on
lexington
affairs
is
bunker
hill
o
fatal
hill
one
glance
at
thee
restrains
my
once
warm
blood
and
chills
it
in
my
veins
may
no
sweet
grass
adorn
thy
hateful
crest
that
saw
britannia
bravest
troops
distrest
or
if
it
does
may
some
destructive
gale
the
green
leaf
wither
and
the
grass
turn
pale
all
moisture
to
your
brow
may
heaven
deny
and
god
and
man
detest
you
just
as
i
is
bunker
hill
this
night
has
brought
us
here
pray
question
him
who
led
your
armies
there
nor
dare
my
courage
into

call
or
blame
lord
piercy
for
the
fault
of
all
howe
chanced
to
nod
while
heathenish
piercy
spoke
but
as
his
lordship
ceased
his
honour
awoke
like
those
whom
sermons
into
sleep
betray
then
rubbed
his
eyes
and
thus
was
heard
to
say
shall
those
who
never
ventured
from
the

or
their
ships
sides
now
pull
our
glory
down

halted
on

we
fought
with

that

for
something

ere

you

cried
what

now
attend
a
counsel
i
impart
that
long
has
laid
the
heaviest
at
my
heart
three
weeks
ye
gods
nay
three
long
years
it
seems
since
i
have
touched
except
in
dreams
in
sleep
choice
dishes
to
my
view
repair
waking
i
gape
and
champ
the
empty
say
is
it
just
that
i
who
rule
these
bands
should
live
on
husks
like
rakes
in
foreign
lands
come
let
us
plan
some
project
ere
we
sleep
and
drink
destruction
to
the
rebel
sheep
on

uncounted
cattle
stray
fat
beeves
and

these
are

visions
for
my

these
if
my

act
as
i
would
wish
in
one
short
week
should
glad
your

we
will
sup

through
the

and
what

as
surely
pleased
them
all

was

to
execute
the
plan
and
thus
pleased
them

a

slumbers
stole
upon

nodded
from
on

his

just
opened
to
find
how

he
said
and
so
dissolved
ye
are
then
downward
sunk
to
slumbers
dark
and

relaxed

of

island
by

what
are
these

thrice
repulsed

hemmed
up

britain
the

still
treats
our

the

remains

bind
their

they
scorn
our
plea
is
our
own
efforts
that
must
make
us
free
born
to
contend
our
lives
we
place
at

to

as

long

endless
nights
in

if
you

be
spent
touch
with

melancholy
prayer
perhaps
a
mountain
or
dame
fancy
there
could
i
refuse
since
mutual
grief
endears
to
seek
new
albion
lady
all
in
tears
but
doubts
perplexing
hover
my
mind
whether
to
chuse
the
aid
of
horse
or
wind
that
suits
the
best
with
bards
of
place
and
state
this
must
be
needy
rhymers
compensate
since
jove
his
ancient
bounty
has
deny
and
grants
no
modern
pegasus
to
ride
dark
was
the
night
the
winds
tempestuous
from
western
skies
and
warn
us
all
aboard
spread
were
the
sails
the
nimble
vessel
flies

and
reflected
skies
nor
halt
i
here
to
tell
you
how
she
roves
tython
chambers
and
his
coral
groves
let
some
prose
journals
keep
i
haste
me
like
the
vessel
the
deep
nor
tire
you
with
descriptions
of
the
coast
new

or
hills
in
æther
lost
the
muse
can
only
hint
at
scenes
like
these
not
stop
to
spend
her
poem
in
their
praise
three
days
we
cut
the
brine
with
steady
prore
the
fourth
beheld
as
on

shore
guard
me
ye

this
defenceless

while

plains

me
may
heaven
defend
us
all
from
the
harsh
rigour
of
king
george
ball
far
in
the
depth
of
an
aspiring
wood
where
roll
its
waves
a
silver
winding
flood
our
weary
vessel
urg
its
darksome
way
and
safely
anchor
in
a
shady
bay
landing
i
left
the
crew
and
pensive
rov
as
travellers
do
when
all
at
once
before
my
eyes
the
genius
of
the
river
seem
to
rise
tall
and
erect
untaught
by
years
to
bow
but
not
a
smile
relax
his
clouded
brow
his
swarthy
features
vengeful
deeds
forebode
terror
march
on
before
him
as
he
trode
his
rattling
quiver
at
his
shoulder
hung
his
pointed
spear
and
helmet
rung
the
tall
oaks
trembled
at
the
warlike
shade
when
thus
the
genius
of
the
water
said
o
curious
stranger
come
from
far
to
see
what
grieves
us
all
but
none
so
much
as
me
the
genius
of
the
woods
am
i
who
scorn
to
dwell
in
lands
of
slavery
i
tho
unseen
command
the
heart
to
dare
and
spread
the
soul
of
freedom
thro
the
air
that
each
may
taste
and
value
if
he
can
this
sovereign
good
that
constitutes
the
man
here
in
the
center
of
tyrannic
sway
i
spread
my
spirit
and
forbid
dismay
to
every
bosom
dart
may
influence
round
like
the
sun
beams
that
fructify
the
ground
but
waft
a
timorous
and
ignoble
breath
where
conscience
conscience
bids
them
shrink
at
death
o
stranger
led
by
heaven
supreme
decree
go
view
the
dire
effects
of
tyranny
strait
to
the
town
direct
thy
fated
way
but
heark
attentive
listen
and
obey
i
to
thy
care
commit
this
magic
vest
to
guard
thee
yon
spires
a
viewless
guest
its
wreathy
folds
thy
limbs
embrace
no
mortal
eye
thy
roving
step
shall
trace
unseen
as
ghosts
that
quit
the
clay
below
yet
seeing
all
securely
thou
shalt
go
there
watch
the
motions
of
the
hostile
lines
observe
their
counsels
watch
their
deep
designs
trace
all
their
schemes
the
lawless
strength
survey
of
licens
robbers
howling
for
their
prey
so
spoke
the
genius
of
the
shaded
wave
and
then
the
vest
of
wondrous
virtue
gave
which
scarce
my
limbs
enwrapt
when
i
began
to
move
as
before
did
mortal
man
light
as
the
air
as
free
as
winds
i
stray
pierc
firmest
rocks
and
walls
for

high
nor

feeble
aid
of

trac

an
author
he
was
a
voluminous
and
his
vivid
and
interesting
letters
of
which
great
numbers
have

throw
much
light
upon

this

the

was
at
the

of
the
reinforcements
which
rescued
the
british
regulars
on
their
retreat
from
concord
and
lexington
and
it
was
under
his
leadership
that
the
disastrous
retreat
was
continued
to
boston
i
believe
the
fact
stripped
of
all
coloring
washington
wrote
six
weeks
later
on
to
be
plainly
this
that
if
the
retreat
had
not
been
as
precipitate
as
it
was
and
god
knows
it
could
not
have
been
more
so
the
ministerial
troops
must
have
surrendered

been
totally
cut
off

not
more
than
one

was
spent

even
the
king
descended
to
implore
and
often
with
him
in
his
closet
pent
was
plagu
to
death
to
rule
this
armament
who
could
a
monarch
favourite
wish
deny
i
yielded
just
for
peace
ay
faith
did
i
if
this
be
sin
o
tell
me
reverend
sage
what
will
alas
become
of
guilty
gage
if
this
be
sin
is
sin
i
make
no
doubt
but
trust
me
honour
sir
i
help
you
out
even
tho
your
arms
had
rag
from
town
to
town
and
mow
like
flags
these
rebel
nations
down
and
joyful
bell
return
the
murdering
din
and
you
yourself
the
master
butcher
been
all
should
be
well
from
sins
like
this
i
ween
a
dozen
masses
shall
discharge
you
clean
small
pains
in
purgatory
you
endure
and
hell
you
know
is
only
for
the
poor
pay
well
the
priest
and
fear
no
station
there
for
heaven
must
yield
to
vehemence
of
prayer
heaven
grant
that
this
may
be
my
smallest
sin
alas
good
friar
i
yet
deeper
in
come
round
my
bed
with
friendly
groans
condole
to
gratify
my
paunch
i
wrong
my
soul
arms
i
may
wield
and
murder
by
command
spread
devastation
thro
a
guiltless
land
whole
ranks
to
hell
with
howling
cannon
sweep
but
what
had
i
to
do
with
stealing
sheep
i
read
my
orders
conn
them
with
care
but
not
a
word
of
stealing
sheep
is
there
come
holy
friar
can
you
make
a
shift
to
help
a
sinner
at
so
dead
a
lift
or
must
i
onward
to
perdition
go
with
theft
and
murder
to
complete
my
woe
murder
nay
hold
your
honour
is
too
sad
things
are
not
yet
i
hope
become
so
bad
murder
indeed
you
stole
and
that
i
know
but
sir
believe
me
you
not
struck
a
blow
some
few
americans
have
bled
is
true
but
was
the
soldiers
killed
them
and
not
you
well
said
but
will
this
subtile
reasoning
stand
did
not
the
soldiers
murder
by
command
by
my
command
friar
they
did
i
swear
and
i
must
answer
for
their
deeds
i
fear
let
each
man
answer
for
his
proper
deed
from
sins
of
murder
i
pronounce
you
freed
and
this
same
reasoning
will
your
honour
keep
from
imputations
of
purloining
sheep
wallace
for
this
to
rome
shall
post
away
and
for
this
crying
sin
severely
pay
and
tho
his
zeal
may
think
his
penance
slight
hair
cloth
and
logs
shall
be
his
bed
at
night
coarse
fare
by
day
till
his
repeated
groans
convince
the
world
he
for
this
sin
atones
alas
poor
wallace
how
i
pity
thee
but
let
him
go
is
better
him
than
me
yes
let
him
harbour
in
some
convent
there
and
fleas
monastic
bite
him
till
he
swear
but
friar
have
you
patience
for
the
rest
half
my
transgressions
are
not
yet
confest
not
half
you
are
a
harmless
man
i
told
pray
cut
them
short
the
supper
will
be
cold
some
devil
regardless
of
exalted
station
in
evil
hour
assail
me
with
temptation
to
issue
forth
a
damned
proclamation
what
prince
what
king
from
belzebub
is
free
he
tempted
judas
and
has
tempted
me
this
this
o
friar
was
a
deadly
flaw
this
for
the
civil
founded
martial
law
this
crime
will
gage
to
lucifer
consign
and
purgatory
must
for
this
be
mine
next
and
for
this
i
breathe
my
deepest
sigh
ah
cruel
flinty
hard
remorseless
i
how
could
i
crowd
my
dungeons
dark
and
low
with
wounded
captives
of
our
injur
foe
how
could
my
heart
more
hard
than
hardened
steel
laugh
at
the
pangs
that
mangled
captives
feel
why
sneer
i
at
my
fellow
men
distrest
why
banished
pity
from
this
iron
breast
o
friar
could
heaven
approve
my
acting
so
heaven
still
to
mercy
swift
to
vengeance
slow
o
no
you
say
then
cease
your
soothing
chat
cowards
are
cruel
i
can
instance
but
hold
why
did
i
when
the
fact
was
done
deny
it
all
to
gallant
washington
why
did
i
stuff
the
epistolary
page
with
vile
invectives
only
worthy
gage
come
friar
help
shall
i
recant
and
say
i
writ
my

on
a
drunken
day
how
will
it
sound
if
men
should
chance
to
tell
a
drunken
hero

compose
so
well
your
fears
are
groundless
give
me
all
the
blame
i
writ
the
letter

a
manuscript
note
upon
this
copy
unquestionably
the
handwriting
of

is
as

by

published
october
the

was
manifestly
written
after

recall
the
poet
never
reprinted
it
on

george

wrote
to
lord
north
i
have
desired
lord
dartmouth
to
acquaint

that
as
he
thinks
nothing
further
can
be
done
this
campaign
in
the
province
of

that
he
is
desired
instantly
to
come
over
that
he
may
explain
the
various
wants
for
carrying
on
the
next

it
was
a
kindly
pretext
devised
to
spare
the
feelings

unprofitable

a
faithful
and
a
brave

general
gage
embarked
at
boston
for
england
the
scarcity
of
provisions
in
the
british
camp
during
the
siege
of
boston
has
been
already
alluded
to
when
marauding
expeditions
says
bancroft
returned
with
sheep
and
hogs
and
cattle
captured
from
islands
the
bells
were
rung
as
for

alluding
to

all

washington
had
written
to
gage
remonstrating
against
the
cruel
treatment
of
certain
american
officers
who
were
denied
the
privileges
and
immunities
due
their
rank
almost
the
last
official
act
of
gage
was
to
reply
through
burgoyne
in
a
letter
addressed
to
george
washington
that
britons
ever
in
mercy
have
overlooked
the
criminal
in
the
captive
your
prisoners
whose
lives
by
the
law
of
the
land
are
destined
to
the
cord
have
hitherto
been
treated
with
care
and
kindness
indiscriminately
it
is
true
for
i
acknowledge
no
rank
that
is
not
derived
from
the
king
the
distrest
shepherdess
or
mariana
complaint
for
the
death
of
damon
written
what
madness
compell
my
dear
shepherd
to
go
to
the
siege
of
quebec
and
distract
me
with
woe
my
heart
is
so
full
it
would
kill
me
to
tell
how
he
died
on
the
banks
of
the
river
sorel
o
river
sorel
thou
didst
hear
him
complain
when
dying
he
languish
and
called
me
in
vain
when
pierc
by
the
briton
he
went
to
repel
he
sunk
on
the
shores
of
the
river
sorel
o
cruel
misfortune
my
hopes
to
destroy
he
has
left
me
alone
with
my
colin
his
boy
with
sorrow
i
see
him
with
tears
my
eyes
swell
shall
we
go
my
sweet
babe
to
the
river
sorel
but
why
should
i
wander
and
give
him
such
pain
my
damon
will
see
his
colin
again
to
wander
so
far
where
the
wild
indians
dwell
we
should
faint
ere
we
came
to
the
river
sorel
but
even
to
see
the
pale
corpse
of
my
dear
would
give
me
such
rapture
such
pleasure
sincere
i
go
my
dear
boy
and
my
grief
i
will
tell
to
the
willows
that
grow
by
the
river
sorel
how
shall
i
distinguish
my
shepherd
dear
grave
amidst
the
long
forest
that
darkens
the
wave
perhaps
they
could
give
him
no
tomb
when
he
fell
perhaps
he
is
sunk
in
the
river
sorel
he
was
a
dear
fellow
o
had
he
remain
for
he
was
uneasy
i
complain
he
call
me
his
charmer
and
call
me
his
belle
what
a
folly
to
die
on
the
banks
of
sorel
then
let
me
remain
in
my
lonely
retreat
my
shepherd
departed
i
never
shall
meet
here
billy
i
love
him
as
well
and
damon
may
stay
at
the
river
sorel
this
poem
is
unique
in
the
edition
of
freneau
works
it
is
evidently
an
earlier
version
of
the
mars
and
hymen
below
mars
and
hymen
occasioned
by
the
separation
of
a
young
widow
from
a
young
military
lover
of
the
troops
sent
to
attack
fort
chamblee
in
canada
in
which
expedition
he
lost
his
life
of
the
lucinda
damon
thyrsis
why
do
we
talk
of
shaded
bowers
when
frosts
my
fair
one
chill
the
plain
and
nights
are
cold
and
long
the
hours
that
damp
the
ardour
of
the
swain
who
parting
from
his
rural
fire
all
pleasure
doth
forego
and
here
and
there
and
everywhere
pursues
the
invading
foe
yes
we
must
rest
on
frosts
and
snows
no
season
shuts
up
our
campaign
hard
as
the
rocks
we
dare
oppose
the
autumnal
or
the
wintery
reign
alike
to
us
the
winds
that
blow
in
summer
season
gay
or
those
that
rave
on
hudson
wave
and
drift
his
ice
away
winter
and
war
may
change
the
scene
the
ball
may
pierce
the
frost
may
chill
and
dire
misfortunes
intervene
but
freedom
must
be
powerful
still
to
drive
these
britons
from
our
shore
who
come
with
sail
who
come
with
oar
so
cruel
and
unkind
with
servile
chain
who
strive
in
vain
our
freeborn
souls
to
bind
months
they
scold
me
and
tell
me
i
must
not
complain
to
part
a
few
weeks
with
my
favourite
swain
he
goes
to
the
battle
and
leaves
me
to
mourn
and
tell
me
and
tell
me
and
will
he
return
when
he
left
me
he
kiss
me
and
said
my
sweet
dear
in
less
than
a
month
i
again
will
be
here
but
still
i
can
hardly
my
sorrows
adjourn
you
may
call
me
a
witch
if
ever
i
return
i
said
my
dear
soldier
i
beg
you
would
stay
but
he
with
his
farmers
went
strutting
away
with
anguish
and
sorrow
my
bosom
did
burn
and
i
wept
for
i
thought
he
would
never
return
fairest
of
the
female
train
you
must
seek
another
swain
damon
will
not
come
again
all
his
toils
are
over
as
you
prized
him
to
excess
your
loss
is
great
i
will
confess
but
lady
yield
not
to
distress
i
will
be
your
lover
not
all
the
swains
the
land
can
shew
if
damon
is
not
living
now
can
from
my
bosom
drive
my
woe
or
bid
a
second
passion
glow
for
damon
has
possession
not
all
the
gifts
that
wealth
can
bring
nor
all
the
airs
that
you
can
sing
nor
all
the
music
of
the
string
can
banish
his
impression
wedlock
and
death
too
often
prove
pernicious
to
the
fires
of
love
with
equal
strength
they
both
combine
hearts
best
united
to
disjoin
hence
ardent
loves
too
soon
remit
thus
die
the
fires
that
cupid
lit
female
tears
and
april
snow
sudden
come
and
sudden
go
since
his
head
is
levelled
low
cease
remembrance
of
your
woe
can
it
be
in
reason
found
to
be
crazy
for
love
wound
must
you
live
in
sorrows
drowned
for
a
lover
under
ground
what
a
picture
have
i
seen
what
can
all
these
visions
mean
wintry
groves
and
vacant
halls
coffins
hid
by
sable
palls
monuments
and
funerals
forms
terrific
to
the
sight
ghastly
phantoms
clad
in
white
streams
that
ever
seemed
to
freeze
shaded
by
willow
trees
ever
drooping
hardly
green
what
a
vision
have
i
seen
one
i
saw
of
angel
kind
from
the
dregs
of
life
refined
on
her
visage
such
a
smile
and
she
talk
in
such
a
style
all
was
heaven
upon
her
brow
yes
i
think
i
see
her
now
all
in
beams
of
light
arrayed
and
these
cheering
words
she
said
fair
lucinda
come
to
me
what
has
grief
to
do
with
thee
o
forsake
your
wretched
shore
crimsoned
with
its
children
gore
could
you
but
a
moment
stray
in
the
meadows
where
i
play
you
would
die
to
come
away
come
away
and
speed
your
wing
here
we
love
and
here
we
sing
you
will
not
yet
forget
your
glooms
the
heavy
heart
the
downcast
eye
the
cheek
that
scarce
a
smile
assumes
the
sigh
had
you
the
secret
cause
to
grieve
that
in
this
breast
doth
lie
instead
of
wishing
to
relieve
you
would
be
just
as
i
what
secret
cause
have
you
to
grieve
a
lover
gone
astray
if
one
was
able
to
deceive
perhaps
another
may
my
lover
has
not
me
deceived
an
act
he
would
disdain
oh
he
is
gone
and
i
am
grieved
he
never
come
again
he
never
come
again
the
turtle
on
yon
withered
bough
who
lately
moaned
her
murdered
mate
has
found
another
partner
now
such
changes
all
await
again
her
drooping
plume
is
dress
again
she
wishes
to
be
bless
and
takes
a
husband
to
her
nest
if
nature
has
decreed
it
so
with
some
above
and
all
below
let
us
lucinda
banish
woe
nor
be
perplext
with
sorrow
if
i
should
leave
your
arms
this
night
and
die
before
the
morning
light
i
would
advise
you
and
you
might
wed
again
the
turtle
on
yon
withered
tree
that
turtle
never
felt
like
me
her
grief
is
but
a
moment
date
another
day
another
mate
and
true
it
is
the
feathered
race
hold
many
a
partner
no
disgrace
how
would
the
world
my
fault
display
what
would
censorious
sally
say
would
say
while
grinning
malice
sneers
she
made
a
conquest
by
her
tears
my
polly
once
the
pride
of
all
that
shepherd
lads
their
charmers
call
too
early
parted
with
her
bloom
and
sleeps
in
yonder
sylvan
tomb
her
death
has
set
me
free
fair
as
the
day
and
sweet
as
may
but
what
is
that
to
me
since
all
must
bow
to
fate
arrest
no
love
deceased
shall
rack
my
breast
come
then
lucinda
and
be
blest
my
damon
oh
can
i
forget
the
hour
you
left
these
moistened
eyes
northern
lakes
to
wander
far
to
colder
climes
and
dreary
skies
there
vengeful
in
their
wastes
of
snow
the
britons
guard
the
frozen
shore
and
damon
there
is
perished
now
the
swain
that
shall
return
no
more
weep
weep
no
more
my
jersey
lass
the
pang
is
past
that
fixed
his
doom
they
too
shall
to
destruction
pass
perhaps
and
hardly
find
a
tomb
refrain
your
tears
enough
are
shed
they
too
shall
have
their
share
of
woe
fled
is
their
fame
their
honours
fled
and
washington
shall
lay
them
low
if
you
had
but
yon
sergeant
size
his
mien
and
looks
so
debonaire
you
might
seem
lovely
in
my
eyes
nor
should
you
quite
despair
there
something
in
your
looks
i

use
of
the
opening
speeches
of
damon

in
his
drama
he
omitted
the
poem
from
the
edition
of
his
works
retaining
however
the
opening
lyric
which
he
entitled

northern
soldier
the
poem
was
reprinted
in
the

of
the
text
of
which
i
have
used

the
earlier
version
with
great
care

verbal
variations

of

safe
from
the
miscreants
that
my
peace
molest
miscreants
with
dullness
and
with
rage
opprest
i
can
find
only
two
versions
of
this
poem
that
in
the
edition
of
the
poet
which
i
have
reproduced
and
that
in
the
edition
in
which
the
title
is
changed
to
a
satire
in
answer
to
a
hostile
attack
first
written
and
published
from
the
nature
of
the
concluding
lines
of
the
poem
it
may
be
inferred
that
it
was
the
last
work
done
by
the
poet
before
starting
on
his
voyage
to
the
west
indies
late
in
november
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
a
trace
of
the
hostile
attack
in
the
newspapers
or
publications
of
the
period
or
of
the
original
publication
of
mac
swiggen
the
poem
was
omitted
from
the
edition
only
the
first
eight
lines
being
used
in
the
short
poem
to
shylock
the
poet
made
many
verbal
changes
for
the
later
edition
but
i
have
marked
only
the
most
significant
urge
your
little
soul
to
meant
you
harm
thou
bright
genius
in
each
case
where
mac
swiggen
is
used
in
the
earlier
version
it
is
changed
this
giant
sangrado
dear
satirist
a
green
goose
scribbler
and
insect
are
supplied
in
its
place
of
the
remaining
lines
of
the
poem
fifty
were
taken
from
the
satires
written
by
the
poet
while
in
college
in
the
war
between
the
whig
and
cliosophic
societies
many
of
the
lines
were
much
changed
the
portion
used
by
freneau
may
be
said
to
comprise
all
of
the
three
early
satires
that
could
be
quoted
with
decency
this
line
and
the
one
following
not
in
the
satires
this
line
and
the
one
following
not
in
the
satires
this
line
and
the
seven
following
not
in
the
satires
this
line
and
the
seven
following
not
in
the
satires
six
lines
not
in
satires
the
remainder
of
the
poem
not
in
the
satires
the
house
of
night
a
vision
advertisement
this
poem
is
founded
upon
the
authority
of
scripture
inasmuch
as
these
sacred
books
assert
that
last
enemy
that
shall
be
conquered
is
for
the
purposes
of
poetry
he
is
here
personified
and
represented
as
on
his
dying
bed
the
scene
is
laid
at
a
solitary
palace
the
time
midnight
which
before
beautiful
and
joyous
is
now
become
sad
and
gloomy
as
being
the
abode
and
receptacle
of
death
its
owner
an
amiable
majestic
youth
who
had
lately
lost
a
beloved
consort
nevertheless
with
a
noble
philosophical
fortitude
and
humanity
entertains
him
in
a
friendly
manner
and
by
employing
physicians
endeavours
to
restore
him
to
health
altho
an
enemy
convinced
of
the
excellence
and
propriety
of
that
divine
precept
thine
enemy
hunger
feed
him
if
he
thirst
give
him
he
nevertheless
as
if
by
a
spirit
of
prophecy
informs
this
fictitiously
wicked
being
of
the
certainty
of
his
doom
and
represents
to
him
in
a
pathetic
manner
the
vanity
of
his
expectations
either
of
a
reception
into
the
abodes
of
the
just
or
continuing
longer
to
make
havock
of
mankind
upon
earth
the
patient
finding
his
end
approaching
composes
his
epitaph
and
orders
it
to
be
engraved
on
his
tombstone
hinting
to
us
thereby
that
even
death
and
distress
have
vanity
and
would
be
remembered
with
honour
after
he
is
no
more
altho
his
whole
life
has
been
spent
in
deeds
of
devastation
and
murder
he
dies
at
last
in
the
utmost
agonies
of
despair
after
agreeing
with
an
avaricious
undertaker
to
intomb
his
bones
this
reflects
upon
the
inhumanity
of
those
men
who
not
to
mention
an
enemy
would
scarcely
cover
a
departed
friend
with
a
little
dust
without
certainty
of
reward
for
so
doing
the
circumstances
of
his
funeral
are
then
recited
and
the
visionary
and
fabulous
part
of
the
poem
disappears
it
concludes
with
a
few
reflections
on
the
impropriety
of
a
too
great
attachment
to
the
present
life
and
incentives
to
such
moral
virtue
as
may
assist
in
conducting
us
to
a
better
trembling
i
write
my
dream
and
recollect
a
fearful
vision
at
the
midnight
hour
so
late
death
me
spread
his
sable
wings
painted
with
fancies
of
malignant
power
such
was
the
dream
the
sage
chaldean
saw
disclos
to
him
that
felt
vengeful
rod
such
was
the
ghost
who
through
deep
silence
cry
shall
mortal
man
be
juster
than
his
god
let
others
draw
from
smiling
skies
their
theme
and
tell
of
climes
that
boast
unfading
light
i
draw
a
darker
scene
replete
with
gloom
i
sing
the
horrors
of
the
house
of

stranger
believe
the
truth
experience
tells
poetic
dreams
are
of
a
finer
cast
than
those
which
the
sober
brain
diffus
are
but
a
repetition
of
some
action
past

i
own
thy
power
when
sunk
in
sleep
thou
thy
wild
delusive
part
so
well
you
lift
me
into

or

the
scenes
of
hell
by
some
sad
means
when
reason
holds
no
sway

i
rov
at
midnight
a
plain
where
murmuring
streams
and

rivers
flow

springs

tho

no

each
lifeless
tree
dark
was
the
sky
and
not
one
friendly
star
shone
from
the
zenith
or

clear
mist
sate
upon
the
woods
and
darkness
rode
in
her
black
chariot
with
a
wild
career
and
from
the
woods
the
late
resounding
note
issued
of
the
loquacious
a

i

the

of
men
in

room
much
did
they
talk
of
death
and
much
of
life
of
coffins
shrouds
and
horrors
of
a
tomb

were
their
words
and

were
they
all
but
there
remain
not

to
hear
the
upshot
of
their
conference
meantime
from
an
adjoining
chamber
came
confused
murmurings
half
distinguish
sounds
and
as
i
nearer
drew
disputes
arose
of
surgery
and
remedies
for

dull
were
their
feuds
for
they
went
on
to

the

of
many
muscles
and
often
each
to
prove
his

true
brought
proofs
from

fancy
led
me
hence
and
left
them
so
firm
at
their
points

then
up
three
winding
stairs
my
feet
were
brought
to
a

chamber
hung
with
mourning

glar
with

in
ecstacy
of

run
mad
a
wide

stood
on
either
side
well
fraught
with
phials
half
their
liquids
spent
and
from
a
couch
behind
the
curtain
veil
i
heard
a
hollow
voice
of
loud
lament
turning
to
view
the
object
whence
it
came
my
frighted
eyes
a
horrid
form
survey
fancy
i
own
thy

death
on
the
couch
with
fleshless
limbs
at
rueful
length
was
laid
and
his
head
flew
jealousies
and
cares
ghosts
imps
and
half
the
black
tartarian
crew
damn
nor
was
their
prince
remote
borne
on
the
vaporous
wings
of
stygian
dew
around
his
bed
by
the
dull
flambeaux

i

phantoms

to
madness

wan
wasting
grief
and
ever
musing
care
distressful
pain
and
poverty
perplext
sad
was
his
countenance
if
we
can
call
that
countenance
where
only
bones
were
seen
and
eyes
sunk
in
their
sockets
dark
and
low
and
teeth
that
only
show
themselves
to
grin
reft
was
his
scull
of
hair
and
no
fresh
bloom
of
chearful
mirth
sate
on
his
visage
hoar
sometimes
he
rais
his
head
while
groans
were
mixt
with
words
that
did
his
fate
deplore
oft
did
he
wish
to
see
the
daylight
spring
and
often
toward
the
window
lean
to
hear
of
the
morn
the
early
note
of
wakeful
chanticleer
thus
he
but
at
my
hand
a
portly
youth
of
comely
countenance
began
to
tell
that
this
was
death
upon
his
dying
bed
sullen
morose
and
peevish
to
be
well
fixt
is
his
doom
the
miscreant
reigns
no
more
the
tyrant
of
the
dying
or
the
dead
this
night
concludes
his
reign
pour
out
ye
your
vengeance
on
his
head
but
since
my
friend
said
he
chance
leads
you
here
with
me
this
night
upon
the
sick
attend
you
on
this
bed
of
death
must
watch
and
i
will
not
be
distant
from
the
fretful
fiend
before
he
made
this
lofty
pile
his
home
in
undisturb
repose
i
sweetly
slept
but
when
he
came
to
this
sequester
dome
was
then
my
troubles
came
and
then
i
wept
twice
three
long
nights
in
this
sad
chamber
i
as
though
a
brother
languish
in
despair
have
faithful
round
his
gloomy
bed
have
been
content
to
breathe
this
loathsome
air
a
while
relieve
the
languors
that
i
feel
sleep
magic
forces
close
my
weary
eyes
soft
my
soul
unwonted
slumbers
steal
aid
the
weak
patient
till
you
see
me
rise
but
let
no
slumbers
on
your
fall
that
if
he
ask
for
powder
or
for
pill
you
may
be
ready
at
the
word
to
start
and
still
seem
anxious
to
perform
his
will
the
bleeding
saviour
of
a
world
undone
bade
thy
compassion
rise
toward
thy
foe
then
stranger
for
the
sake
of
mary
son
thy
tears
of
pity
on
this
wretch
bestow
was
he
that
stole
from
my
adoring
arms
aspasia
she
the
loveliest
of
her
kind
lucretia
virtue
with
a
helen
charms
charms
of
the
face

blushy
cheek

lively
beaming
eye
the
ruby

flowing
jetty
hair
the
stature

the
aspect
so
divine
all
beauty
you
would
think
had

there
each
future

her
virtues
shall
extol
nor
the
just
tribute
to
her
worth
refuse
fam
to
the

urania
bids
her
rise
theme
of

moral
and
the
tragic
muse
sweet
as
the
fragrance
of
the
vernal
morn
nipt
in
its
bloom
this
faded
flower
i
see
the
inspiring
angel
from
that
breast
is
gone
and
life
warm
tide
forever
chill
in
thee
such
charms
shall
greet
my
longing
soul
no
more
her
lively
eyes
are
clos
in
endless
shade
torpid
she
rests
on
yonder
marble
floor
approach
and
see
what
havock
death
has
made
yet
stranger
hold
her
charms
are
so
divine
such
tints
of
life
still
on
her
visage
glow
that
even
in
death
this
slumbering
bride
of
mine
may
seize
thy
heart
and
make
thee
wretched
too
o
shun
the
sight
forbid
thy
trembling
hand
from
her
pale
face
to
raise
the
enshrouding
lawn
death
claims
thy
care
obey
his
stern
command
trim
the
dull
tapers
for
i
see
no
dawn
so
said
at
death
left
side
i
sate
me
down
the
mourning
youth
toward
his
right
reclin
death
in
the
middle
lay
with
all
his
groans
and
much
he
toss
and
tumbled
sigh
and
pin
but
now
this
man
of
hell
toward
me
turn
and
strait
in
hideous
tone
began
to
speak
long
held
he
sage
discourse
but
i
forebore
to
answer
him
much
less
his
news
to
seek
he
talk
of
and
of
monuments
of
equinoctial
climes
and
india
shores
he
talk
of
stars
that
shed
their
influence
fevers
and
plagues
and
all
their
noxious
stores
he
mention
too
the
guileful
c
tempting
the
sailor
on
the
deep
sea
main
that
paints
gay
groves
upon
the
ocean
floor
beckoning
her
victim
to
the
faithless
scene
c
an
inflammatory
fever
attended
with
a
delirium
common
in
long
voyages
at
sea
in
which
the
diseased
persons
fancy
the
sea
to
be
green
fields
and
meadows
and
if
they
are
not
hindered
will
leap
much
spoke
he
of
the
myrtle
and
the
yew
of
ghosts
that
nightly
walk
the
of
storms
that
through
the
ocean
blow
and
dash
the
galley
on
the
shore
of
cannons
and
the
thunderbolt
of
sieges
and
convulsions
dearth
and
fire
of
poisonous
weeds
but
seem
to
sneer
at
these
who
by
the
laurel
him
did
aspire
then
with
a
hollow
voice
thus
went
he
on
get
up
and
search
and
bring
when
found
to
me
some
cordial
potion
or
some
pleasant
draught
sweet
poppy
or
the
mild
bohea
but
hark
my
pitying
friend
and
if
you
can
deceive
the
grim
physician
at
the
door
bring
half
the
mountain
springs
ah
hither
bring
the
cold
rock
water
from
the
shady
bower
for
till
this
night
such
thirst
did
invade
a
thirst
provok
by
avenging
hand
hence
bear
me
friends
to
quaff
and
quaff
again
the
cool
wave
bubbling
from
the
yellow
sand
to
these
dark
walls
with
stately
step
i
came
prepar
your
drugs
and
doses
to
defy
smit
with
the
love
of
never
dying
fame
i
came
alas
to
conquer
not
to
die
glad
from
his
side
i
sprang
and
fetch
the
draught
which
down
his
greedy
throat
he
quickly
swills
then
on
a
second
errand
sent
me
strait
to
search
in
some
dark
corner
for
his
pills
quoth
he
these
pills
have
long
compounded
been
of
dead
men
bones
and
bitter
roots
i
trow
but
that
i
may
to
wonted
health
return
throughout
my
lank
veins
shall
their
substance
go
so
down
they
he
rais
his
fainting
head
and
oft
in
feeble
tone
essay
to
talk
quoth
he
since
remedies
have
small
avail
assist
unhappy
death
once
more
to
walk
then
slowly
rising
from
his
loathsome
bed
on
wasted
legs
the
meagre
monster
stood
gap
wide
and
foam
and
hungry
seem
to
ask
tho
sick
an
endless
quantity
of
food
said
he
the
sweet
melodious
flute
prepare
the
anthem
and
the
organ
solemn
sound
such
as
may
strike
my
soul
with
ecstacy
such
as
may
from
yon
lofty
wall
rebound
sweet
music
can
the
fiercest
pains
assuage
she
bids
the
soul
to
heaven
blest
mansions
rise
she
calms
despair
controuls
infernal
rage
and
deepest
anguish
when
it
hears
her
dies
and
see
the
mizzling
misty
midnight
reigns
and
no
soft
dews
are
on
my
sent
here
stranger
lend
thy
hand
assist
me
pray
to
walk
a
circuit
of
no
large
extent
on
my
prest
shoulders
leaning
round
he
went
and
could
have
made
the
boldest
spectre
flee
i
led
him
up
stairs
and
i
led
him
down
but
not
one
moment
rest
from
pain
got
he
then
with
his
dart
its
cusp
unpointed
now
thrice
with
main
strength
he
smote
the
trembling
floor
the
roof
resounded
to
the
fearful
blow
and
cleon
started
doom
to
sleep
no
more
when
thus
spoke
death
impatient
of
controul
quick
move
and
bring
from
yonder
black
bureau
the
sacred
book
that
may
preserve
my
soul
from
long
damnation
and
eternal
woe
and
with
it
bring
for
you
may
find
them
there
the
works
of
holy
authors
dead
and
gone
the
sacred
tome
of
moving
drelincourt
or
what
more
solemn
sherlock
mus
upon
and
read
my
cleon
what
these
sages
say
and
what
the
sacred
penman
hath
declar
that
when
the
wicked
leaves
his
odious
way
his
sins
shall
vanish
and
his
soul
be
spar
but
he
unmindful
of
the
vain
command
reason
with
death
nor
were
his
reasonings
few
quoth
he
my
lord
what
frenzy
moves
your
brain
pray
what
my
lord
can
sherlock
be
to
you
or
all
the
sage
divines
that
ever
wrote
grave
drelincourt
or
heaven
unerring
page
these
point
their
arrows
at
your
hostile
breast
and
raise
new
pains
that
time
must
assuage
and
why
should
thus
thy
woe
disturb
my
rest
much
of
theology
i
once
did
read
and
there
is
fixt
sure
as
my
god
is
so
that
death
shall
perish
tho
a
god
should
bleed
the
martyr
doom
the
pangs
of
fire
to
feel
lives
but
a
moment
in
the
sultry
blast
the
victim
groans
and
dies
beneath
the
steel
but
thy
severer
pains
shall
always
last
o
miscreant
vile
thy
age
has
made
thee
doat
if
peace
if
sacred
peace
were

for
you
hell
would
cry
out
and
all
the

arise
and

for

thee
where

nor
even
where
gliding
to
the
persian
main
thy
waves
euphrates
through

bloody
has
been
thy
reign
o
man
of
hell
who
sympathiz
with
no

cruel
wast
thou

away
remember
how
with
unrelenting
ire
you
tore
the
infant
from
the
unwilling
breast
aspasia
fell

must
expire
doom
by
the
impartial
god
to
endless
rest
in

with
stars
he
deck
yon
spangled

and
bade
the
mind
to

soar
and
brought
so
far
to
my
admiring
eyes
a
glimpse
of
glories
that
shall
blaze
no

now
to

thy
devilish
wrath

alas
the

deny
the
comforts
to
our
parting
moments

art
thou
like
all
the
devils
nor

a
gloomy

with
sullen

is
thine
where
never

grow
no
daffodils
nor

columbine
no
hyacinths
nor
asphodels
for
you
the
barren
trees
that
flourish
on

with

never

to
bend
languid
waves
unblossom
branches
hang
and
every
branch
sustains
some
vagrant
fiend
and
now
no
more
remains
but
to
prepare
to
take
possession
of
thy
punishment
that
thy
inheritance
that
thy
domain
a
land
of
bitter
woe
and
loud
lament
and
oh
that
he
who
spread
the
universe
would
cast
one
pitying
glance
on
thee
below
millions
of
years
in
torments
thou
fry
but
thy
eternity
who
can
conceive
its
woe
he
heard

round
with
his
black
gaz
full
of
despair

when
on
the
lofty
dome
rush
from
the
clouds
a
hoarse
resounding
blast
round
the
four
eaves
so
loud
and
sad
it
as
though
all
musick
were
to
breathe
its
last
warm
was
the
gale
and
such
as
travellers
say
sport
with
the
winds
on
zaara
barren
waste
black
was
the
sky
a
mourning
carpet
spread
its
azure
blotted
and
its
stars
lights
in
the
air
like
burning
stars
were
hurl
dogs
howl
heaven
mutter
and
the
tempest
blew
the
red
peeped
from
behind
a
cloud
as
if
in
dread
the
amazing
scene
to
view
the
mournful
trees
that
in
the
garden
stood
bent
to
the
tempest
as
it
rush
along
the
elm
the
myrtle
and
the
cypress
sad
more
melancholy
tun
its
bellowing
song
no
more
that
elm
its
noble
branches
spread
the
yew
the
cypress
or
the
myrtle
tree
rent
from
the
roots
the
tempest
tore
them
down
and
all
the
grove
in
wild
confusion
lay
yet
mindful
of
his
dread
command
i
part
glad
from
the
magic
dome
nor
found
relief
damps
from
the
dead
hung
heavier
round
my
heart
while
sad
remembrance
rous
her
stores
of
grief
a
dark
field
i
held
my
dubious
way
where
walk
his
lonely
round
beneath
my
feet
substantial
darkness
lay
and
screams
were
heard
from
the
distemper
ground
nor
look
i
back
till
to
a
far
off
wood
trembling
with
fear
my
weary
feet
had
sped
dark
was
the
night
but
at
the
inchanted
dome
i
saw
the
infernal
windows
flaming
red
and
from
within
the
howls
of
death
i
heard
cursing
the
dismal
night
that
gave
him
birth
damning
his
ancient
sire
and
mother
sin
who
at
the
gates
of
hell
accursed
brought
him
forth
for
fancy
gave
to
my
enraptur
soul
an
eagle
eye
with
keenest
glance
to
see
and
bade
those
distant
sounds
distinctly
roll
which
waking
never
had
affected
me
oft
his
pale
breast
with
cruel
hand
he
smote
and
tearing
from
his
limbs
a
winding
sheet
roar
to
the
black
skies
while
the
woods
around
as
wicked
as
himself
his
words
repeat
thrice
the
skies
his
meagre
arms
he
rear
invok
all
hell
and
thunders
on
his
head
bid
fly
earth
yawn
and
tempests
roar
and
the
sea
wrap
him
in
its
oozy
bed
my
life
for
one
cool
draught
o
fetch
your
springs
can
one
unfeeling
to
my
woes
be
found
no
friendly
visage
comes
to
my
relief
but
ghosts
impend
and
spectres
hover
round
though
humbled
now
dishearten
and
distrest
yet
when
admitted
to
the
peaceful
ground
with
heroes
kings
and
conquerors
i
shall
rest
shall
sleep
as
safely
and
perhaps
as
sound
dim
burnt
the
lamp
and
now
the
phantom
death
gave
his
last
groans
in
horror
and
despair
all
hell
demands
me
hence
he
said
and
threw
the
red
lamp
hissing
through
the
midnight
air
trembling
across
the
plain
my
course
i
held
and
found
the
loitering
through
the
gloom
and
in
the
midst
a
wandering
light
walking
in
fiery
circles
round
the
tomb
among
the
graves
a
spiry
building
stood
whose
tolling
bell
resounding
through
the
shade
sung
doleful
ditties
to
the
adjacent
wood
and
many
a
dismal
drowsy
thing
it
said
this
fabrick
tall
with
towers
and
chancels
grac
was
rais
by
sinners
hands
in
ages
fled
the
roof
they
painted
and
the
beams
they
brac
and
texts
from
scripture
the
walls
they
spread
but
wicked
were
their
hearts
for
they
to
aid
the
helpless
orphan
when
distrest
the
shivering
naked
stranger
they
and
banish
from
their
doors
the
starving
guest
by
laws
protected
cruel
and
prophane
the
poor
man
ox
these
monsters
drove
away
and
left
distress
to
attend
her
infant
train
no
friend
to
comfort
and
no
bread
to
stay
but
heaven
look
on
with
keen
resentful
eye
and
doom
them
to
perdition
and
the
grave
that
as
they
felt
not
for
the
wretch
distrest
so
heaven
no
pity
on
their
souls
would
have
in
pride
they
rais
this
building
tall
and
fair
their
hearts
were
on
perpetual
mischief
bent
with
pride
they
preach
and
pride
was
in
their
prayer
with
pride
they
were
deceiv
and
so
to
hell
they
went
at
distance
far
approaching
to
the
tomb
by
lamps
and
lanthorns
guided
through
the
shade
a
chariot
hurried
through
the
gloom
spectres
attending
in
black
weeds
array
whose
woeful
forms
yet
chill
my
soul
with
dread
each
wore
a
vest
in
stygian
chambers
wove
death
kindred
all
death
horses
they
bestrode
and
gallop
fiercely
as
the
chariot
drove
each
horrid
face
a
grizly
mask
conceal
their
busy
eyes
shot
terror
to
my
soul
as
now
and
then
by
the
pale
lanthorn
glare
i
saw
them
for
their
parted
friend
condole
before
the
hearse
death
chaplain
seem
to
go
who
strove
to
comfort
what
he
could
the
dead
talk
much
of
satan
and
the
land
of
woe
and
many
a
chapter
from
the
scriptures
read
at
last
he
rais
the
swelling
anthem
high
in
dismal
numbers
seem
he
to
complain
the
captive
tribes
that
by
euphrates
wept
their
song
was
jovial
to
his
dreary
strain
that
done
they
plac
the
carcase
in
the
tomb
to
dust
and
dull
oblivion
now
resign
then
turn
the
chariot
the
house
of
night
which
soon
flew
off
and
left
no
trace
behind

as
i
stoop
to
write
the
appointed
verse
swifter
than
thought
the
airy

blushing
the
morn
arose

from
the
east
with
her
gay
streams

ye
deep
read
sophists
say

i

if

what
pleasure
could
be
mine
can
he
allure
me

look
like
satan
aiming
to

such
pride
and
madness
were
his
inmates
now

not
contented
with
this
hectoring
priest
sick
of

softly
i

at

prayers
were

in

the
sad
pall
above
the

spread
from
many
a
tender
breast
drew
many
a
groan
the

too
some
tears
of

shed
reeling
before
the

procession
he

in

and
his

ah
me
the
words
of
faith
in
both
his

he
bore
prayers
cut

dry
by
ancient
prelates
made
who
bigots
while
they
liv
could
do
no
more
than
leave
them
still
by

at

they
reach
the
spiry
building
high
and
soon
they
enter
at
the
eastern
gate
the
parson
said
his
prayers
most
learnedly
and
mutter
more
than
memory
can
relate
then
through
the
temple
lengthy
aisles
they
went
approaching
still
the
pulpit
painted
door
from
whence
on
sundays
many
a
vow
was
sent
and
sermons
plunder
from
some

text
from
the
edition
of
the
poem
was
first
published
in
the
february
issue
of
the
states
as
a
part
of
an
extended
article
with
the
title
account
of
the
island
of
santa
cruz
containing
an
original
poem
on
the
beauties
of
that
island
in
a
letter
to
p
esq
the
poem
is
introduced
as
follows
i
believe
the
best
thing
i
can
do
with
the
rest
of
this
paper
is
to
transcribe
a
few
dull
heavy
lines
which
i
composed
near
two
years
ago
on
the
spot
the
poem
consisted
of
stanzas
corresponding
to
the
following
above
freneau
revised
it
with
a
careful
hand
for
his
edition
of
some
of
the
lines
changed
most
notably
are
as
follows
stanza
less
rigorous
climes
and
a
more
friendly
sky
so
some
dull
minds
in
spite
of
age
and
care
are
grown
so
wedded
to
this
globe
below
sweet
spungy
plumbs
on
trees
wide
spreading
hang
the
happy
flavour
pine
grows
crested
from
the
ground
where
once
the
indian
dames
inchanted
slept
cassada
shrubs
abound
whose
poison
root
supplies
the
want
of
northern
flour
this
grated
fine
and
steep
in
water
fair
forsakes
each
particle
of
noxious
power
on
yonder
peaked
hill
fresh
harvests
rise
where
wretched
he
the
ethiopian
swain
he
pants
a
land
of
freedom
and
repose
where

slavery
never
sought
to
reign
o
quit
thee
them
my

and
tell
me
why
but
now
the

are

the

subsides
all

smiles

the
beauteous

renew
how
shall
i
leave
my
green
retreat
at
butler
verdant

fain
would
i
view
my
native
climes
again
but
murder
marks
the
cruel
briton
there
contented
here
i
rest
in

quaff
the

the

heavy
on

yon
lagging

drags
slowly
the

its

to

then

haste
and
leave
behind
thee

the

you
less

just
may
grow
if

the

sorrow
stole
down
his

was
vengeance

despair
dissolved
his
eye

planted

there
how
could
he
hope
to
bribe
the
impartial
sky
by
his
base
prayers
and
mean
hypocrisy
heaven
still
is
just
and
still
abhors
all
crimes
not
acts
like
george
the
nero
of
our

what
were
his
prayers
his
prayers
could
be
no

such
prayers

never

they

in

you
prayed

rousing

a

fine
as

me
there
had
i

still
with
my

on

the
cruel
tyrant
man

since

soon
abridged
my
little
span
how
shall
i
the
wrong
forget
over
me
he
threw

and
i
am
his
prisoner
yet
to
this
rough
bermudian

i
was
hurried
to

my
country

who
once
so
gaily
shined
sing
to
please
the
human

dear
amanda
leave
me
free
and
my
notes
will
sweeter
be
on
your
breast
or
in
the
tree
on
your
arm
i
would
repose
one
oh
make
me
of
your
beaus
there
i
would
relate
my
woes
now
all
love
and
full
of
play
i
so
innocently
gay
pine
my
little
life
away
thus
to
grieve
and
flutter
here
thus
to
pine
from
year
to
year
this
is
usage
too
severe
from
the
chiefs
who
rule
your
isle
i
will
never
court
a
smile
all
with
them
is
prison
style
but
from
your
superior
mind
let
me
but
my
freedom
find
and
i
will
be
all
resigned
then
your
kiss
will
hold
me
fast

rest
gentle
shepherds

so
fondly
hear
my
strain
help
me
to
be
free
again
is
a
blessing
to
be
free
fair
amanda

him
who
sings
for
thee
but
if
cruel
you
deny
that
your
captive
bird
should
fly

detained
so
wrongfully
full
of

she

in

oppose
proud

by

this
pile
of
such
superior
fame
from
their
strict
union
takes
her

for
them
she
cleaves
the
briny
tide
while
terror
marches
by
her
side
when
she
unfurls
her
flowing
sails
undaunted
by
the
fiercest
gales
in
dreadful
pomp
she
ploughs
the
main
while
adverse
tempests
rage
in

when

gloomy
tier
the

foes
congeal
with
fear

owning

might
seek
their
best
safety
in

flight
but
when
she
pours
the
dreadful
blaze
and
thunder
from
her
cannon
plays
the
bursting
flash
that
wings
the
ball
compells
those
foes
to
strike
or
fall
though
she
with
her
triumphant
crew
might
to
their
fate
all

faithful

close

this
poem
was
first
published
as
a
pamphlet
in
by
francis
bailey
of
philadelphia
in
connection
with
the
prison
ship
nicholas
biddle
born
in
philadelphia
in
was
a
sailor
from
his
boyhood
at
one
time
he
served
beside
nelson
in
the
british
navy
in
when
the
new
frigate
of
guns
was
launched
at
philadelphia
he
was
made
commander
and
after
several
unimportant
cruises
he
was
placed
over
a
small
fleet
of
war
vessels
with
the
as
flagship
in
march
he
fell
in
with
the
british
ship
and
after
a
vigorous
action
of
twenty
minutes
the
was
blown
up
by
her
own
magazine
only
four
men
escaping
with
their
lives
freneau
has
made
several
minor
errors
the
date
which
is
found
on
all
the
versions
of
the
poem
should
manifestly
be
the
did
not
attempt
flight
nor
did
biddle
die
at
the
moment
of
victory
as
the
poet
represents
in
the
words
of
cooper
victory
was
almost
hopeless
even
had
all
his
vessels
behaved
equally
well
with
his
own
ship
captain
vincent
had
only
five
men
killed
and
twelve
wounded
at
the
time
of
the
explosion
yet
the
gallantry
and
skill
of
biddle
in
the
face
of
great
odds
justify
all
the
praise
that
freneau
gives
him
his
ancient
honours
this
stanza
was
omitted
from
the
edition
but
returned
again
in
and
lost
what
honour
and
lost
what
courage

the

on
their

from
the
deep
seas
that
round
us
swell
with
rocks
the
surges
to
repel
some
verdant
isle

a

for

a

below
even
britain
lads
it

they
were
the
masters
of
the
sea
now
combating
upon
the
brine
where
ships
in
flaming
squadrons
join
at

the

clouds

ride
now
every

dissolves
with

on

half
lost

see
a

sight
the
realms
of
everlasting
night
a
tomb
of
ocean
green
and
only
one
frail
plank
between
but
winds
must
cease
and
storms
decay

the

day
again
the
skies
are
warm
and
clear
again
soft
zephyrs
fan
the
air
again
we
find
the
long
lost
shore
the
winds
oppose
our
wish
no
more
if
thou
hast
courage
to
despise
the

changes
of

captain
john
paul
jones
sailed
from
isle
de
groaix
france
on
his
memorable
cruise
august
to
secure
a
crew
for
his
fleet
had
been
the
work
of
many
months
disheartening
the
sea
voyage
from
a
gay
island
green
and
fair
with
gentle
blasts
of
southern
air
across
the
deep
we
held
our
way
around
our
barque
smooth
waters
played
no
envious
clouds
obscur
the
day
serene
came
on
the
evening
shade
still
farther
to
the
north
we
drew
and
porto
rico
mountains
blue
were
just
decaying
on
the
eye
when
from
the
main
arose
the
sun
before
his
ray
the
shadows
fly
as
we
before
the
breezes
run
now
northward
of
the
tropic
pass
the
fickle
skies
grew
black
at
last
the
ruffian
winds
began
to
roar
the
sea
obey
their
tyrant
force
and
we
alas
too
far
from
shore
must
now
forsake
our
destin
course
the
studding
sails
at
last
to
hand
the
captain
gave
command
but
scarcely
to
the
task
went
they
when
a
vast
billow
us
broke
and
tore
the
sheets
and
tacks
away
nor
could
the
booms
sustain
the
stroke
still
vaster
rose
the
angry
main
the
winds
through
every
shroud
complain
the
topsails
we
could
spread
no
more
though
doubly
reef
the
furious
blast
away
the
fluttering
canvas
bore
and
vow
destruction
to
the
mast
when
now
the
northern
storm
was
quell
a
calm
ensued
but
ocean
beyond
the
towering
mountain
height
till
from
the
south
new
winds
arose
our
sails
we
spread
at
dead
of
night
and
fair
though
fierce
the
tempest
blows
when
morning
rose
the
skies
were
clear
the
gentle
breezes
warm
and
fair
convey
us
the
road
a
ship
us
on
the
way
her
thousand
sails
were
spread
abroad
and
flutter
in
the
face
of
day
at
length
through
many
a
climate
pass
cæsaria
hills
we
saw
at
last
and
reach
the
land
of
