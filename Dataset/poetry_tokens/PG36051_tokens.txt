feeling

currents
of
liberty
and

life
against

and
the

which
are

up
their

at

to

without
some

of

a

of

so
personal
for
the
most

and

my
own
too
easy
taste
of
freedom
rather
than
my
share
in
the
world
struggle
towards
an
age
and
universe
of
it
that
struggle
has
always
occupied
my
thoughts
and
often
my
energies
and
yet
i
have
never
identified
myself
with
it
or
found
my
undivided
being
there
i
have
found
that
rather
in
individual
experience
and
in
those
moments
of
energetic
idleness
when
the
life
of
universal
nature
seemed
to
come
to
its
bloom
of
realization
in
my
consciousness
life
is
older
than
liberty
it
is
greater
than
revolution
it
burns
in
both
camps
and
life
is
what
i
love
and
though
i
love
life
for
all
men
and
women
and
so
inevitably
stand
in
the
ranks
of
revolution
against
the
cruel
system
of
these
times
i
loved
it
first
for
myself
its
essence
the
essence
of
life
is
variety
and
specific
depth
and
it
can
not
be
found
in
monotonous
consecration
to
a
general
principle
therefore
i
have
feared
and
avoided
this
consecration
which
earnest
friends
for
some
reason
always
expect
me
to
exemplify
and
my
poetry
has
never
entered
even
so
deeply
as
it
might
into
those
tempests
of
social
change
that
are
coloring
our
thoughts
today
poetry
that
has
life
for
its
subject
and
untempered
reality
is
rather
expected
to
manifest
that
irregular
flow
and
exuberance
of
material
over

with
which
walt
whitman
challenged
the

in

at

the

poignant
candor
of

to
that

which
finds
its
original
in

there
existed

however
a

of

whose

turned
back
in

to

they

the

those
who
touched
the
mood

for
my

i
think
there
is
a

in

aims
at
the

which
means
far
far
more
than
appears
at
first
and
to
arouse
and
initiate
more
than
to
define
or
finish
in
my
opinion
the
time
has
arrived
to
essentially
break
down
the
barriers
of
form
between
prose
and
poetry
i
say
the
latter
is
henceforth
to
win
and
maintain
its
character
regardless
of
rhyme
and
the
of
iambic
spondee
dactyl
and
that
even
if
rhyme
and
those
measurements
continue
to
furnish
the
medium
for
inferior
writers
and
themes
especially
for
persiflage
and
the
comic
as
there
seems
henceforward
to
the
perfect
taste
something
inevitably
comic
in
rhyme
merely
in
itself
and
anyhow
the
truest
and
greatest
while
subtly
and
necessarily
always
rhythmic
and
distinguishable
easily
enough
can
never
again
in
the
english
language
be
in
arbitrary
and
rhyming
metre
any
more
than
the
greatest
eloquence
or
the
truest
power
and
passion
while
admitting
that
the
venerable
and
heavenly
forms
of
chiming
versification
have
in
their
time
play
great
and
fitting
parts
that
the
pensive
complaint
the
ballads
wars
amours
legends
of
europe
have
many
of
them
been
inimitably
render
in
rhyming
verse
that
there
have
been
very
illustrious
poets
whose
shapes
the
mantle
of
such
verse
has
beautifully
and
appropriately
envelopt
and
though
the
mantle
has
fallen
with
perhaps
added
beauty
on
some
of
our
own
age
it
is
notwithstanding
certain
to
me
that
the
day
of
such
conventional
rhyme
is
ended
in
america
at
any
rate
and
as
a
medium
of
highest
aesthetic
practical
or
spiritual
expression
present
or
future
it
palpably
fails
and
must
fail
to
serve
the
muse
of
the
prairies
of
california
canada
texas
and
of
the
peaks
of
colorado
dismissing
the
literary
as
well
as
social
etiquette
of
feudalism
and
caste
joyfully
enlarging
adapting
itself
to
comprehend
the
size
of
the
whole
people
with
the
free
play
emotions
pride
passions
experiences
that
belong
to
them
body
and
soul
to
the
general
globe
and
all
its
relations
in
astronomy
as
the
savans
portray
them
to
us
to
the
modern
the
busy
nineteenth
century
as
grandly
poetic
as
any
only
different
with
steamships
railroads
factories
electric
telegraphs
cylinder
presses
to
the
thought
of
the
solidarity
of
nations
the
brotherhood
and
sisterhood
of
the
entire
earth
to
the
dignity
and
heroism
of
the
practical
labor
of
farms
factories
foundries
workshops
mines
or
on
or
on
lakes
and
rivers
resumes
that
other
medium
of
expression
more
flexible
more
eligible
soars
to
the
freer
vast
diviner
heaven
of
prose
it
may
surprise
some
people
to
see
this
monumental
challenge
to
the
poets
of
the
future
confronted
with
the
pathetic
memory
of
edgar
allan
poe
and
yet
it
is
natural
to
place
these
two
poets
in
contrast
and
the
weight
neither
of
genius
nor
of
influence
is
altogether
upon
one
side
they
are
the
two
american
poets
of
unique
distinction
and
they
are
the
fountains
of
the
two
strongest
influences
in
all
modern
poetry
of
the
occident
and
it
is
worth
observing
that
if
walt
whitman
had
written
as
few
pages
of
poetry
as
poe
did
his
name
would
hardly
be
remembered
whereas
poe
would
have
established
a
literary
tradition
if
he
had
written
but
five
sorrowful
lyrics
his
individuality
was
so
poignant
his
art
was
so
exquisite
and
not
only
was
his
art
exquisite
but
his
philosophy
of
his
art
was
as
unique
assertive
and
prodigious
in
contempt
for
his
predecessors
as
that
of
walt
whitman
i
have
never
read
anything
about
any
art
more
sheer
and
startling
in
its
kind
than
poe
essay
on
the
philosophy
of
composition
and
nothing
more
energetically
opposite
to
walt
whitman
could
possibly
be
devised
to
convey
the
flavor
of
the
contrast
i
quote
these
sentences
inadequate
for
any
other
purpose
from
poe
essay
most
writers
poets
in
especial
prefer
having
it
understood
that
they
compose
by
a
species
of
fine
frenzy
an
ecstatic
intuition
and
would
positively
shudder
at
letting
the
public
take
a
peep
behind
the
scenes
at
the
elaborate
and
vacillating
crudities
of
thought
at
the
true
purposes
seized
only
at
the
last
moment
at
the
innumerable
glimpses
of
idea
that
arrived
not
at
the
maturity
of
full
view
at
the
fully
matured
fancies
discarded
in
despair
as
unmanageable
at
the
cautious
selections
and
rejections
at
the
painful
erasures
and
interpolations
in
a
word
at
the
wheels
and
pinions
the
tackle
for
the
and
the
cock
feathers
the
red
paint
and
the
black
patches
for
my
own
part
i
have
neither
sympathy
with
the
repugnance
alluded
to
nor
at
any
time
the
least
difficulty
in
recalling
to
mind
the
progressive
steps
of
any
of
my
compositions
and
since
the
interest
of
an
analysis
or
reconstruction
such
as
i
have
considered
a
is
quite
independent
of
any
real
or
fancied
interest
in
the
thing
analyzed
it
will
not
be
regarded
as
a
breach
of
decorum
on
my
part
to
show
the
by
which
some
one
of
my
own
works
was
put
together
i
select
raven
as
most
generally
known
let
us
dismiss
as
irrelevant
to
the
poem
the
circumstance
or
say
the
necessity
which
in
the
first
place
gave
rise
to
the
intention
of
composing
poem
that
should
suit
at
once
the
popular
and
critical
taste
we
commence
then
with
this
intention
the
initial
consideration
was
that
of
extent
if
any
literary
work
is
too
long
to
be
read
at
one
sitting
we
must
be
content
to
dispense
with
the
immensely
important
effect
derivable
from
unity
of
impression
for
if
two
sittings
be
required
the
affairs
of
the
world
interfere
and
everything
like
totality
is
at
once
destroyed
my
next
thought
concerned
the
choice
of
an
impression
or
effect
to
be
conveyed
and
here
i
may
as
well
observe
that
throughout
the
construction
i
kept
steadily
in
view
the
design
of
rendering
the
work
appreciable
i
should
be
carried
too
far
out
of
my
immediate
topic
were
i
to
demonstrate
a
point
upon
which
i
have
repeatedly
insisted
and
which
with
the
poetical
stands
not
in
the
slightest
need
of
demonstration
the
point
i
mean
that
beauty
is
the
sole
legitimate
province
of
the
poem
but
in
subjects
so
handled
however
skilfully
or
with
however
vivid
an
array
of
incident
there
is
always
a
certain
hardness
or
nakedness
which
repels
the
artistical
eye
two
things
are
invariably
required
first
some
amount
of
complexity
or
more
properly
adaptation
and
second
some
amount
of
suggestiveness
some
however
indefinite
of
meaning
it
is
this
latter
in
especial
which
imparts
to
a
work
of
art
so
much
of
that
to
borrow
from
colloquy
a
forcible
term
which
we
are
too
fond
of
confounding
with
the
opposition
of
these
two
characters
and
attitudes
is
complete
upon
the
one
side
a
vast
preoccupation
with
human
meaning
and
morals
with
health
and
the
common
reality
and
love
and
democracy
a
grand
contempt
for
beauty
and
for
the
effort
to
attract
or
gratify
a
reader
with
verbal
melody
a
contempt
for
everything
that
savors
of
deliberate
technique
in
art
upon
the
other
side
also
contempt
contempt
like
a
piece
of
cold
analytical
steel
for
every
pretense
that
the
technique
of
art
is
not
deliberate
that
poets
are
not
seeking
to
attract
and
gratify
that
truth
or
moral
or
meaning
instead
of
beauty
is
the
portent
of
a
poem
a
disposition
to
seek
beauty
in
unique
and
even
unhealthy
places
a
lonely
aristocratic
heart
of
pain
and
a
preoccupation
with
verbal
melody
never
before
or
since
equalled
in
poetry
the
details
of
this
difference
are
fascinating
but
the
generalization
of
it
is
what
will
illumine
the
modern
problems
about
poetry
to
edgar
allan
poe
a
poem
was
an
objective
thing
to
walt
whitman
poetry
was
an
act
of
subjective
expression
poe
would
take
sounds
and
melodies
of
words
almost
actually
into
his
hands
and
carve
and
model
them
until
he
had
formed
a
beautiful
vessel
and
he
would
take
emotions
and
imaginations
out
of
his
heart
and
weave
and
inlay
them
in
that
vessel
and
even
the
crimson
out
of
his
blood
and
finally
for
enrichment
he
would
seek
out
in
his
mind
the
hue
of
some
meaning
or
moral
to
pour
over
it
until
it
was
perfect
and
these
beautiful
vessels
he
would
set
forth
for
view
and
purchase
standing
aside
from
them
like
a
creative
trader
proud
but
no
more
identified
with
them
than
as
though
he
had
made
them
out
of
the
colors
of
shells
to
walt
whitman
a
poem
was
not
a
thing
his
poetry
was
himself
his
meanings
emotions
experiences
love
and
wonder
of
life
filled
him
and
he
overflowed
in
language
without
art
without
purpose
but
to
communicate
his
being
so
he
maintained
his
poem
was
never
an
object
to
him
even
after
it
had
flowed
full
and
he
sought
to
perfect
its
contours
his
emendations
were
not
often
objective
improvements
they
were
private
remodellings
to
make
the
language
a
more
direct
and
fluent
identity
with
what
he
considered
himself
this
was
the
task
upon
which
he
labored
as
the
poet
of
democracy
and
social
love
now
it
is
not
merely
an
accident
or
a
reflection
upon
america
or
upon
human
nature
that
walt
whitman
with
all
his
yearnings
over
the
average
american
and
his
offering
of
priesthood
and
poetry
to
the
people
should
remain
the
poet
of
a
rather
esoteric
few
whereas
poe
even
with
the
handful
of
poems
he
wrote
may
be
said
to
be
acceptable
to
the
generality
of
men
the
raven
or
helen
or
annabelle
lee
or
some
sad
musical
echo
of
the
death
of
beauty
might
be
found
in
illuminated
covers
on
the
most
average
of
american
parlor
tables
but
never
anything
there
of
walt
whitman
unless
it
be
captain
my
captain
the
one
rather
weak
metrical
poem
he
deigned
to
write
and
there
is
something
deeply
and
really
pathetic
in
this
fact
and
something
which
only
an
adequate
science
of
verse
can
explain
for
the
emotions
and
the
meanings
of
walt
whitman
poetry
are
actually
the
ones
that
interest
simple
and
thoughtful
people
who
have
leisure
to
feel
his
realizations
of
life
would
be
acceptable
and
be
honored
as
much
at
least
as
great
art
is
ever
honored
by
the
divine
average
if
they
had
been
conveyed
as
poe
were
in
vessels
of
light
which
would
make
them
objective
and
from
which
they
might
brim
over
with
excess
of
subjective
meaning
and
emotion
i
do
not
mean
to
express
a
wish
that
walt
whitman
had
conveyed
them
so
or
the
opinion
that
he
could
have
been
a
more
stupendous
poetic
and
moral
hero
of
nature
by
writing
otherwise
than
he
did
his
propulsive
determination
to
put
forth
in
this
facile
nineteenth
century
culture
sweet
with
the
decay
and
light
with
the
remnant
fineries
of
feudal
grandeur
the
original
vast
unfinished
substance
of
man
was
a
phenomenon
like
the
rising
of
a
volcanic
continent
amid
ships
on
the
sea
no
word
but
the
words
in
his
book
can
portray
the
magnitude
of
his
achievement
no
critic
but
envy
could
judge
it
except
as
itself
and
by
its
own
standard
but
as
a
prophetic
example
of
the
poems
of
the
future
and
especially
the
poems
of
democracy
and
social
love
it
suffers
a
weakness
the
weakness
that
walt
whitman
character
suffered
it
is
egocentric
and
a
little
inconsiderate
of
the
importance
of
other
people
walt
whitman
composed
wonderful
passages
about
universal
social
love
but
he
could
not
be
the
universal
poet
exactly
because
he
was
not
social
enough
he
was
not
humble
enough
to
be
social
the
rebel
egoism
of
democracy
was
in
him
the
lordly
and
compelling
thing
and
though
his
love
for
the
world
was
prodigious
it
was
not
the
kind
of
love
that
gives
attention
instinctively
to
the
egoism
of
others
there
may
be
no
grand
passion
for
the
idea
but
there
is
a
natural
companionship
with
the
fact
of
democracy
in
poe
statement
that
he
kept
steadily
in
view
the
design
of
rendering
the
work
universally
appreciable
and
that
statement
more
characteristically
distinguishes
his
attitude
from
walt
whitman
than
the
different
ways
they
had
of
talking
about
beauty
all
poets
who
mould
their
poems
objectively
even
though
they
may
conceive
themselves
to
be
utterly
alone
with
beauty
are
really
in
social
communion
with
humanity
for
that
is
what
the
word
means
an
object
or
as
we
say
a
thing
differs
from
other
elements
of
our
experience
only
in
that
it
can
be
experienced
in
the
same
form
at
different
times
and
by
different
persons
and
for
an
object
to
be
beautiful
is
for
it
to
hold
value
in
itself
so
that
various
perceivers
may
come
from
all
sides
and
find
it
there
therefore
one
who
moulds
an
object
towards
external
perfection
however
sad
his
solitude
enters
directly
into
the
universal
friendship
toward
which
walt
whitman
directed
so
much
of
the
longing
of
his
words
one
who
pours
out
phrases
direct
from
his
emotion
may
experience
a
relief
and
glory
that
implies
listeners
and
he
may
win
listeners
but
they
will
each
rebuild
out
of
his
phrases
their
own
different
poem
and
they
will
comprise
in
their
number
only
those
endowed
with
the
special
power
to
build
poems
out
of
phrases
poured
out
and
whatever
we
may
wish
were
true
of
the
world
it
is
not
true
that
the
majority
are
so
endowed
therefore
the
poetry
that
is
highly
subjective
is
almost
inevitably
the
poetry
of
a
few
and
the
direct
expression
of
emotion
achieves
a
less
clear
and
general
social
communion
than
the
embodiment
of
emotion
in
an
object
of
art
it
could
be
established
i
believe
with
mechanical
precision
that
the
rhythmic
values
most
cherished
by
the
social
rebels
who
now
write
so
much
free
verse
are
values
practically
incommunicable
to
others
and
absolutely
incommunicable
by
the
method
usually
adopted
that
of
printing
words
on
a
page
a
little
of
that
icy
realism
with
which
poe
used
to
scatter
the
sweet
foggy
thoughts
of
the
literarious
while
it
might
not
affect
the
art
of
these
poets
would
surely
reduce
the
volume
of
what
they
have
to
say
about
it
for
instance
here
is
the
answer
of
one
of
them
to
an
assertion
that
the
line
division
in
is
arbitrary
and
that
if
we
copied
one
of
these
long
poems
in
solid
prose
the
poet
himself
could
hardly
ever
divide
it
again
as
it
was
free
verse
that
is
free
verse
is
arbitrary
much
of
it
is
of
course
so
are
many
canvases
mere
splashy
imitations
of
matisse
but
there
is
free
verse
that
resolves
itself
into
just
those
lines
a
little
more
subtly
than
sonnets
or
triolets
by
virtue
of
pauses
of
of
the
quickness
or
slowness
of
your
breath
and
maybe
of
your
pulse
itself
it
tries
to
give
the
rhythm
value
of
those
hesitations
those
quickenings
and
slowings
of
the
flow
of
ideas
the
flutterings
it
is
to
the
as
modern
music
and
modern
dance
are
or
as
primitive
music
and
primitive
dance
were
it
is
impossible
not
to
respond
to
such
assertions
for
we
know
in
ourselves
what
these
exquisite
differential
experiences
are
any
one
who
has
ever
written
which
are
a
kind
of
aboriginal
knows
what
they
are
and
yet
i
believe
it
is
obvious
if
not
demonstrable
that
most
of
them
are
too
individual
to
be
communicated
even
to
a
lover
human
nature
is
too
various
for
it
to
be
true
that
the
same
hesitations
the
same
quickenings
and
slowings
of
the
flow
of
ideas
flutterings
of
the
breath
or
pulse
will
reproduce
themselves
in
another
upon
the
perception
of
the
same
visible
symbols
and
while
this
fact
may
make
the
art
of
composition
seem
a
little
monotonous
it
is
better
that
art
should
be
monotonous
than
that
the
world
should
and
it
would
be
a
monotonous
world
in
which
different
people
were
so
much
alike
or
we
ourselves
so
much
alike
at
different
moments
that
these
minute
filigrees
of
feeling
should
be
altogether
durable
and
capable
of
being
served
round
in
paper
and
ink
there
are
values
of
verbal
rhythm
in
a
flow
of
thought
and
feeling
which
exist
for
one
individual
alone
and
for
him
once
only
there
are
other
values
less
delicate
which
he
can
reproduce
in
himself
at
will
but
can
not
altogether
communicate
to
other
minds
whose
thoughts
and
feelings
are
too
much
their
own
there
are
other
values
still
less
delicate
which
he
might
communicate
by
vocal
utterance
and
rhythmic
gesture
taking
possession
as
it
were
of
the
very
pulse
and
respiration
of
others
but
poetry
which
is
composed
for
publication
ought
to
occupy
itself
with
those
rhythmic
values
which
may
be
communicated
to
other
rhythmic
minds
through
the
printing
of
words
on
a
page
it
ought
to
do
this
at
least
if
it
pretends
to
an
attitude
that
is
even
in
the
most
minute
degree
social
a
mature
science
of
rhythm
might
be
imagined
to
stride
into
the
room
where
these
poets
are
discussing
the
musical
values
of
their
verse
seize
two
or
three
of
the
most
free
and
subtle
among
them
lock
them
into
separate
chambers
and
allow
them
to
read
one
of
their
favorite
passages
into
the
ear
of
an
instrument
designed
to
record
in
spatial
outline
the
pulsations
of
vocal
accent
it
is
safe
to
assert
that
there
would
be
less
identity
in
the
actual
pulsations
recorded
than
if
the
same
two
were
reading
a
passage
of
highly
wrought
english
prose
and
the
reason
for
this
is
that
free
verse
imports
into
english
prose
a
form
of
punctuation
that
is
exceedingly
gross
and
yet
absolutely
inconsequential
its
line
division
has
neither
a
metrical
nor
a
logical
significance
that
exists
objectively
it
can
mean
at
any
time
anything
that
is
desirable
to
the
whims
or
needful
to
the
difficulties
of
the
reader
or
the
writer
it
is
a
very
sign
and
instrument
of
subjectivity
to
incorporate
in
a
passage
of
printed
symbols
an
indeterminate
element
so
marked
and
so
frequent
as
that
is
to
say
to
the
reader
take
the
passage
and
organize
it
into
whatever
rhythmical
pattern
may
please
yourself
and
that
is
what
the
reader
of
free
verse
usually
does
knowing
that
if
he
comes
into
any
great
difficulty
he
can
make
a
full
stop
at
the
end
of
some
line
and
shift
the
gears
of
his
rhythm
altogether
and
since
it
is
possible
for
one
who
is
rhythmically
gifted
to
organize
indeterminate
series
of
impressions
into
an
acceptable
rhythm
he
frequently
produces
a
very
enjoyable
piece
of
music
which
he
attributes
to
the
author
and
having
made
it
himself
is
not
unable
to
admire
thus
a
good
many
poets
who
could
hardly
beat
a
going
march
on
a
base
drum
are
enabled
by
the
gullibility
and
talent
of
their
readers
to
come
forward
in
this
kind
of
writing
as
musicians
of
special
and
elaborate
skill
the
freedom
that
it
gives
them
is
not
a
freedom
to
build
rhythms
that
are
impossible
in
prose
but
a
freedom
from
the
necessity
to
build
actual
and
continuous
rhythms
free
verse
avails
itself
of
the
rhythmic
appearance
of
poetry
and
it
avoids
the
extreme
rhythmic
difficulties
of
prose
and
so
it
will
certainly
live
as
a
supremely
convenient
way
to
write
among
those
not
too
strongly
appealed
to
by
the
greater
convenience
of
not
writing
but
as
an
object
of
the
effort
of
ambitious
artists
i
can
not
believe
it
will
widely
survive
the
knowledge
that
it
is
merely
a
convenience
a
form
of
mumble
and
indetermination
in
their
art
walt
whitman
however
he
may
have
been
deceived
about
the
social
and
democratic
character
of
his
form
was
not
deceived
as
the
modern
eulogists
of
free
verse
are
about
its
subtlety
he
thought
that
he
had
gained
in
volume
and
directness
of
communion
but
he
knew
that
he
was
discarding
subtlety
discarding
in
advance
all
those
beautiful
and
decadent
wonders
of
microscopic
and
morbid
audacity
that
developed
in
france
among
the
admirers
of
poe
the
modern
disciples
of
his
form
however
are
materially
of
poe
persuasion
and
like
to
believe
that
they
have
in
free
verse
an
instrument
expressly
fitted
for
the
communication
of
those
wonders
and
of
the
most
delicate
modulations
of
that
verbal
melody
that
whitman
scorned
in
this
from
the
true
standpoint
of
criticism
whitman
has
a
commanding
advantage
over
them
and
what
can
be
said
of
in
general
can
not
be
said
of
his
poems
he
did
achieve
the
predominant
thing
that
he
aimed
to
achieve
he
made
his
poetry
rough
and
artless
in
spite
of
his
fineness
and
art
he
made
it
like
the
universe
and
like
the
presence
of
a
man
in
that
triumph
it
will
stand
in
that
character
it
will
mould
and
influence
the
literature
of
democracy
because
it
will
mould
and
influence
all
literature
in
all
lands
who
touches
this
book
touches
a
man
there
is
however
another
ideal
of
poetry
that
walt
whitman
confused
with
this
one
and
that
he
no
more
exemplified
in
his
form
than
he
exemplified
democratic
and
social
communion
and
this
ideal
is
predominant
too
in
the
minds
of
his
modern
followers
it
is
the
ideal
of
being
natural
of
being
primitive
dismissing
refinements
and
the
tricks
of
literary
sophistication
he
wanted
his
poetry
to
sound
with
nature
and
the
untutored
heart
of
humanity
it
was
in
the
radiance
of
this
desire
that
he
spoke
of
rhythmical
prose
as
a
vast
diviner
heaven
toward
which
poetry
would
move
in
its
future
development
in
america
prose
seemed
diviner
to
him
because
it
seemed
more
simple
more
large
with
candor
and
directness
but
here
again
a
cool
and
clear
science
will
show
that
his
nature
led
him
in
a
contrary
direction
from
its
ideal
the
music
of
prose
is
only
dissimilar
to
that
of
poetry
in
its
complexity
its
subtle
and
refined
of
the
fundamental
monotonous
meter
that
exists
either
expressed
or
implied
in
the
heart
of
all
rhythmical
experience
persons
who
can
read
the
rhythm
of
prose
can
do
so
because
they
have
in
their
own
breast
or
intellect
a
subdued
or
tacit
perpetual
standard
around
which
by
various
tricks
of
substitution
and
syncopation
they
so
arrange
the
accents
of
the
uttered
syllables
that
they
fall
in
with
its
measure
and
become
one
with
it
increasing
its
momentum
and
its
effect
of
entrancement
upon
the
nerves
and
body
there
is
no
rhythm
without
this
metrical
basis
no
value
in
rhythm
comparable
to
the
trance
that
its
thrilling
monotony
engenders
its
undulations
are
akin
to
the
intrinsic
character
of
neural
motion
and
that
is
why
almost
as
though
it
were
a
chemical
thing
a
stimulant
and
narcotic
it
takes
possession
of
our
and
controls
it
poetry
only
naïvely
acknowledges
this
ecstatic
monotony
that
lives
in
the
heart
of
all
rhythm
brings
it
out
into
the
light
and
there
openly
weaves
upon
it
the
patterns
of
melodic
sound
poetry
is
thus
the
more
natural
and
both
historically
and
psychologically
the
more
primitive
of
the
two
arts
it
is
the
more
simple
meter
and
even
rhyme
which
is
but
a
colored
light
accentuating
the
meter
are
not
ornaments
or
refinements
of
something
else
which
may
be
called
rhythmical
speech
they
are
the
heart
of
rhythmical
speech
expressed
and
exposed
with
a
perfectly
childlike
and
candid
grandeur
prose
is
the
refinement
prose
is
the
sophisticated
and
studio
accomplishment
a
thing
that
vast
numbers
of
people
have
not
the
fineness
of
endowment
or
cultivation
either
to
write
or
read
prose
is
a
civilized
sublimation
of
poetry
in
which
the
original
healthy
intoxicant
note
of
the
is
so
laid
over
with
fine
traceries
of
related
sound
that
it
can
no
longer
be
identified
at
all
except
by
the
analytical
eye
of
science
walt
whitman
was
not
really
playful
and
childlike
enough
to
go
back
to
nature
his
poetry
was
less
primitive
and
savage
than
it
was
superhuman
and
sublime
his
emotions
were
as
though
they
came
to
him
through
a
celestial
telescope
there
is
something
more
properly
savage
something
at
least
truly
barbarous
in
a
poem
like
poe
bells
and
in
insistence
upon
beauty
as
the
sole
legitimate
province
of
the
poem
beauty
which
he
defines
as
a
special
and
dispassionate
excitement
of
the
soul
he
is
nearer
to
the
mood
of
the
snake
dance
poetry
was
to
him
a
deliberate
perpetration
of
ecstasy
and
one
can
see
in
reading
his
verses
how
he
was
attuned
to
sway
and
quiver
to
the
mere
syllabic
singing
of
a
kettledrum
until
his
naked
visions
grew
more
intense
and
lovely
than
the
passions
and
real
meanings
of
his
life
it
is
actually
primitive
as
well
as
childlike
to
play
with
poetry
in
this
intense
and
yet
unsanctimonious
way
that
poe
did
and
baudelaire
too
and
swinburne
play
is
nearer
to
the
heart
of
nature
than
aspiration
it
is
healthier
perhaps
too
and
more
to
the
taste
of
the
future
than
priesthood
i
think
the
essence
of
what
we
call
classical
in
an
attitude
is
his
quite
frank
acknowledgment
that
whatever
great
things
may
come
of
it
he
is
at
play
the
art
of
the
athenians
was
objective
and
overt
about
being
what
it
is
because
the
athenians
were
educated
as
all
free
men
should
be
for
play
they
were
making
things
and
the
eagerness
of
their
hearts
flowed
freely
out
like
a
child
through
their
eyes
upon
the
things
that
they
made
that
pearl
of
adult
degeneration
the
self
was
very
little
cultivated
in
athens
the
artistic
temperament
was
unborn
and
sin
and
the
perpetual
yearning
beyond
of
christians
had
not
been
thought
of
a
little
group
of
isolated
and
exclusive
miracles
had
not
reduced
all
the
true
and
current
glories
of
life
to
a
status
of
ignobility
so
that
every
great
thing
must
contain
in
itself
intimations
of
otherness
the
athenians
were
radiantly
willing
without
any
cosmical
preparation
or
blare
of
moral
resolve
to
let
the
constellations
stay
where
they
are
it
was
their
custom
to
loaf
and
invite
their
souls
to
be
satisfied
see
dance
laugh
sing
they
were
so
maturely
naïve
that
they
would
hardly
understand
what
walt
whitman
with
his
declarations
of
animal
independence
was
trying
to
recover
from
and
so
it
is
by
way
of
their
happy
and
city
that
we
can
most
surely
go
back
to
nature
and
when
we
have
arrived
at
a
mood
that
is
really
and
childly
natural
a
mood
that
will
play
even
with
aspiration
and
will
spontaneously
make
out
of
interesting
materials
things
to
play
with
and
when
in
that
mood
we
give
our
interest
to
the
materials
of
reality
in
our
own
time
then
perhaps
we
shall
find
that
we
have
arrived
also
at
a
poetry
that
belongs
to
the
people
for
people
are
in
the
depths
of
them
and
on
the
average
as
they
are
born
still
natural
still
savage
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
nature
never
fashioned
them
to
work
harder
or
be
more
serious
or
filled
with
purports
than
was
necessary
she
meant
them
to
live
and
flow
out
upon
the
world
with
the
bright
colors
of
their
interest
and
it
will
seem
rather
a
fever
in
the
light
of
universal
history
this
hot
subjective
meaningfulness
of
everything
we
modern
occidentals
value
the
poets
and
the
of
ancient
china
knew
that
all
life
and
nature
was
so
sacred
with
the
miracle
of
being
that
only
the
lucid
line
and
color
was
needed
to
command
an
immortal
reverence
they
loved
perfection
devoutly
as
it
will
rarely
be
loved
but
they
too
with
their
gift
of
delicate
freedom
in
kinship
with
nature
were
at
play
and
in
japan
even
today
surviving
from
that
time
there
is
a
form
of
poetry
that
is
objective
and
childlike
a
making
of
toys
or
of
exquisite
metrical
gems
of
imaginative
realization
and
this
is
the
only
poetry
in
the
world
that
is
truly
popular
and
is
loved
and
cultivated
by
a
whole
nation
if
with
this
pagan
and
oriental
love
for
the
created
thing
the
same
love
that
kept
a
light
in
poe
sombre
heart
we
enter
somewhat
irreverently
into
walt
whitman
volume
seeking
our
own
treasure
and
not
hesitating
to
remove
it
from
its
bed
of
immortal
slag
we
do
find
poems
in
new
forms
of
exquisite
and
wonderful
definition
sometimes
for
the
length
of
one
or
two
or
three
lines
and
occasionally
for
a
stanza
and
once
for
the
whole
poem
when
i
heard
at
the
close
of
the
day
walt
whitman
seems
to
love
and
achieve
the
carved
concentration
of
image
and
emotion
the
definite
and
thrilling
chime
of
syllables
along
a
chain
that
begins
and
ends
and
has
a
native
way
of
uttering
itself
to
all
minds
that
are
in
tune
he
seems
without
losing
that
large
grace
of
freedom
from
the
pose
and
elegance
of
words
in
a
book
which
was
his
most
original
gift
to
the
world
to
possess
himself
of
the
mood
that
is
truly
primitive
and
social
and
intelligible
to
the
hearts
of
simple
people
the
mood
that
loves
with
a
curious
wonder
the
poised
and
perfect
existence
of
a
thing
hush
be
the
camps
hush
be
the
camps
today
and
soldiers
let
us
drape
our
weapons
and
each
with
musing
soul
retire
to
celebrate
our
dear
commander
death
no
more
for
him
life
stormy
conflicts
nor
victory
nor
defeat
no
more
time
dark
events
charging
like
ceaseless
clouds
across
the
sky
reconciliation
word
over
all
beautiful
as
the
sky
beautiful
that
war
and
all
its
deeds
of
carnage
must
in
time
be
utterly
lost
that
the
hands
of
the
sisters
death
and
night
incessantly
softly
wash
again
and
ever
again
this
soil
world
these
sculptural
sentences
with
their
rhythmic
and
still
clarity
of
form
if
they
had
been
the
end
and
essence
of
his
art
and
not
only
a
of
inevitable
genius
might
have
led
the
way
not
perhaps
to
a
great
national
poetry
for
america
but
beyond
that
into
something
international
and
belonging
to
the
universe
of
man
the
step
forward
from
them
would
not
have
been
towards
a
greater
sprawling
and
subjectifying
of
rhythmic
and
poetic
character
but
towards
an
increasing
objective
perfection
which
should
still
cling
to
the
new
and
breathless
thing
the
presence
of
one
who
lives
and
speaks
his
heart
naturally
i
chose
them
not
only
because
they
are
among
the
most
musical
and
imaginative
lines
that
walt
whitman
wrote
but
also
because
in
bringing
a
mood
that
is
calm
and
a
lulling
of
wind
in
the
agonies
of
hate
they
show
themselves
to
be
deep
and
so
it
will
not
be
thought
that
when
i
say
the
poet
of
democracy
will
be
a
child
who
is
at
play
with
the
making
of
things
i
desire
to
narrow
the
range
and
poignancy
of
the
things
he
will
make
he
will
be
free
and
he
will
move
with
a
knowing
and
profound
mind
among
all
the
experiences
and
the
dreams
of
men
but
to
whatever
heights
of
rhapsody
or
moral
aspiration
or
now
unimaginable
truth
he
may
come
he
will
come
as
a
child
whose
clear
eyes
and
deliberate
creative
purposes
are
always
appropriate
and
never
to
be
apologized
for
because
they
are
the
purposes
of
nature
footnote
this
statement
is
borne
out
by
william
morrison
account
of
the
records
of
amy
lowell
reading
of
her
poems
in
his
laboratory
it
constitutes
the
preface
of
the
second
edition
of
his
book
the
rhythm
of
prose
a
book
which
upon
the
true
basis
of
experimentation
analyzes
and
defines
convincingly
for
the
first
time
the
nature
of
rhythmical
experience
and
the
manner
in
which
it
is
derived
by
the
reader
both
from
prose
and
metrical
poetry
until
it
is
amplified
or
improved
by
further
investigation
this
book
will
surely
be
the
basis
of
every
scientific
discussion
of
the
questions
involved
here
poems
coming
to
port
our
motion
on
the
soft
still
misty
river
is
like
rest
and
like
the
hours
of
doom
that
rise
and
follow
one
another
ever
ghosts
of
sleeping
loom
and
languish
quickly
in
the
liquid
gloom
from
watching
them
your
eyes
in
tears
are
gleaming
and
your
heart
is
still
and
like
a
sound
in
silence
is
your
stillness
in
the
streaming
of
laughter
all
around
where
happy
passengers
are
homeward
bound
their
sunny
journey
is
in
safety
ending
but
for
you
no
journey
has
an
end
the
tears
that
to
your
eyes
their
light
are
lending
shine
in
softness
to
no
waiting
friend
beyond
the
search
of
any
eye
they
tend
there
is
no
nest
for
the
unresting
fever
of
your
passion
yearning
there
is
no
rest
nor
blessedness
forever
that
can
clasp
you
quivering
and
pained
whose
eyes
burn
ever
to
the
unattained
like
time
and
like
the
river
fateful
flowing
flowing
though
the
ship
has
come
to
rest
your
love
is
passing
through
the
mist
and
going
going
infinitely
from
your
breast
surpassing
time
on
its
immortal
quest
the
ship
draws
softly
to
the
place
of
waiting
all
flush
forward
with
a
joyful
aim
and
while
their
hands
with
happy
hands
are
mating
lips
are
laughing
out
a
happy
name
you
pause
and
pass
among
them
like
a
flame
the
lonely
bather
and
languid
as
the
yellow
mist
that
swoons
along
the
river
in
the
sun
your
flesh
of
passion
pale
and
with
years
of
heat
that
through
your
veins
have
run
you
lie
with
aching
memories
of
love
alone
and
naked
by
the
weeping
tree
and
indolent
with
inward
longing
move
your
slim
and
sallow
limbs
despondently
if
love
came
warm
and
burning
to
your
dream
and
filled
you
all
your
avid
veins
require
you
would
lie
sadly
still
beside
the
stream
sobbing
in
torture
of
that
vivid
fire
the
same
low
sky
would
weave
its
fading
blue
the
river
still
exhale
its
misty
rain
the
willow
trail
its
waving
over
you
your
longing
only
quickened
into
pain
bed
your
desire
among
the
pressing
grasses
lonely
lie
and
let
your
thirsting
breasts
lie
on
you
lonely
till
the
fever
passes
till
the
undulation
of
your
longing
rests
in
my
room
in
this
high
room
my
room
of
quiet
space
softened
for
my
happiness
i
learn
of
you
wang
wei
and
of
your
loves
your
rhythmic
fisher
sweet
with
solitude
beneath
a
willow
by
the
river
stream
your
agéd
plum
tree
bearing
lonely
bloom
beside
the
torrent
thunder
misty
buds
among
your
saplings
bamboo
my
room
is
sweet
because
of
you
wang
wei
your
tranquil
and
love
so
many
mounds
of
mournful
years
ago
in
that
cool
valley
where
the
colors
lived
my
ceiling
slopes
a
little
like
far
mountains
your
bamboo
can
flourish
here
wang
wei
was
a
great
chinese
painter
and
poet
of
the
century
hours
hours
when
i
love
you
are
like
tranquil
pools
the
liquid
jewels
of
the
forest
where
the
hunted
runner
dips
his
hand
and
cools
his
fevered
ankles
and
the
ferny
air
comes
blowing
softly
on
his
heaving
breast
hinting
the
sacred
mystery
of
rest
fire
and
water
take
back
your
love
swift
sure
and
poignant
as
the
dagger
to
the
mark
your
will
is
burning
ever
it
is
pure
mine
is
vague
water
welling
through
the
dark
holding
all
substances
except
the
spark
picture
the
pleasure
of
the
meadow
stream
when
some
clear
striding
girl
cuts
swift
and
straightly
as
a
gleam
across
its
bosom
ambling
and
aswirl
with
mooning
eddies
and
soft
lips
acurl
such
was
our
meeting
fatefully
so
brief
i
have
no
purpose
and
no
power
to
clutch
gleam
onward
maiden
to
your
goal
of
grief
and
i
more
sadly
flow
remembering
much
yet
doomed
to
take
the
form
of
all
i
touch
you
make
no
answer
you
make
no
answer
you
have
stolen
away
deliberately
in
that
twilight
sorrow
where
the
dark
flame
that
is
your
being
shines
so
well
mysterious
and
deeply
tender
in
your
motion
you
have
softly
left
me
and
the
little
path
along
the
house
is
still
and
i
a
child
forsaken
of
its
mother
i
a
pilgrim
leaning
for
a
friend
grow
faint
and
tell
myself
in
terror
that
my
love
reborn
and
burning
shall
yet
bring
you
more
than
friend
and
mother
o
spirit
shining
home
out
of
a
dark
night
death
is
more
tranquil
than
the
life
of
love
more
calm
more
sure
and
more
unanguished
o
the
path
among
the
trees
is
far
more
tranquil
to
the
dead
than
to
these
anxious
hearts
uptroubled
from
their
beds
who
pace
in
pallid
darkness
on
the
leaves
for
no
good
reason
for
no
reason
but
because
their
limbs
will
not
lie
still
upon
the
sheet
their
limbs
will
not
lie
still
o
how
i
pity
them
sad
hearts
their
marrow
is
and
they
can
not
lie
them
down
in
tranquil
sadness
like
the
dead
a
morning
again
this
morning
the
bold
autumn
spreading
through
the
woods
her
sacred
fire
brings
the
rich
color
of
your
presence
warmly
luminous
to
my
desire
brings
to
my
heart
the
dear
wild
worship
high
and
wayward
as
the
windy
air
and
to
my
pulse
the
hot
sweet
passion
burning
crimson
like
a
poison
there
anniversary
the
flowers
we
planted
in
the
tender
spring
and
through
the
summer
watched
their
blossoming
died
with
our
love
in
autumn
thoughtful
weather
died
and
dropped
downward
altogether
today
in
april
in
the
vivid
grass
they
flash
again
their
laughter
pink
and
yellow
they
wake
before
the
frosty
sunbeams
pass
gay
bold
to
leave
their
chilly
pillow
but
love
sleeps
longer
in
his
wintry
bed
he
sleeps
as
though
the
lifting
light
were
dead
and
spring
poured
not
her
colors
on
the
meadow
he
sleeps
in
his
cold
sober
shadow
autumn
light
so
bright
and
soft
is
the
sweet
air
of
morning
and
so
tenderly
the
light
descends
and
blesses
with
its
fingers
all
the
leaves
unto
the
valley
ends
it
brings
them
all
to
being
when
it
touches
with
its
paleness
every
glowing
vein
the
wild
and
flaming
hollows
of
the
forest
kindle
all
their
crimson
in
its
rain
and
every
curve
receives
its
share
of
morning
every
little
shadow
softly
grows
and
motion
finds
a
melody
more
tender
that
like
a
phantom
through
the
branches
goes
so
bright
and
soft
and
and
quiet
in
its
giving
as
though
love
the
morning
dream
of
life
were
born
of
longing
and
really
poured
its
being
from
above
a
modern
messiah
scarred
with
sensuality
and
pain
and
weary
labor
in
a
mind
not
hard
enough
to
think
a
heart
too
always
tender
sits
the
christ
of
failure
with
his
lovers
they
are
wiser
than
his
parables
but
he
more
potent
for
he
has
the
gift
of
hopelessness
and
want
of
faith
and
love
in
a
red
cross
hospital
today
i
saw
a
face
it
was
a
beak
that
peered
with
pale
round
yellow
vapid
eyes
above
the
bloody
muck
that
had
been
lips
and
teeth
and
chin
a
plodding
doctor
poured
some
water
through
a
rubber
down
a
hole
he
made
in
that
black
bag
of
horny
blood
the
beak
revived
it
smiled
as
chickens
smile
the
doctor
hopes
he
find
the
man
a
tongue
to
tell
with
what
he
used
to
be
a
visit
you
came
with
your
small
tapering
flame
of
passion
thinly
burning
like
a
nun
desire
your
eyes
in
slim
and
fashion
faintly
painting
what
your
veins
require
with
little
pallid
pyramids
of
fire
so
very
small
and
unfulfilled
you
sat
building
a
little
talk
to
keep
you
there
your
face
and
body
pointed
like
a
cat
your
legs
not
reaching
down
from
any
chair
your
thoughts
not
really
reaching
anywhere
so
dumb
and
tiny
yet
love
guessed
your
mood
and
pressed
his
phial
in
its
fervent
bed
and
poured
his
thrilling
philtre
in
my
blood
and
all
his
lustre
on
your
body
shed
and
hot
enamel
on
the
words
you
said
your
littleness
became
a
monstrous
thing
a
rank
retort
a
hot
and
waiting
vat
your
eyes
like
a
snake
in
spring
and
your
laying
off
your
hat
and
fell
your
purpose
like
a
hungry
cat
the
dark
fell
on
us
through
our
narrowed
eyes
the
heat
lashed
up
around
us
from
the
floor
encrimsoning
the
lips
of
our
surprise
to
sway
like
music
and
like
burning
pour
across
the
truth
that
parted
us
before
to
love
love
often
your
delicate
fingers
beckon
and
always
i
follow
oh
if
i
could
stay
and
possess
your
beauty
beckoning
always
a
light
is
laughing
thro
the
scattered
rain
a
color
quickens
in
the
meadow
drops
are
still
upon
the
they
cast
a
silver
shadow
little
fishes
a
myriad
curious
fishes
tiny
and
pink
and
pale
all
swimming
north
together
with
rhythmical
fin
and
tail
a
mountain
surges
among
them
they
dart
and
startle
and
float
mere
wiggling
minutes
of
terror
into
that
mountain
throat
invocation
truth
be
more
precious
to
me
than
the
eyes
of
happy
love
burn
hotter
in
my
throat
than
passion
and
possess
me
like
my
pride
more
sweet
than
freedom
more
desired
than
joy
more
sacred
than
the
pleasing
of
a
friend
sometimes
sometimes
a
child
voice
crying
on
the
street
comes
winging
like
an
arrow
through
the
wind
to
pierce
my
breast
with
you
my
baby
and
my
pen
is
weak
and
all
my
thinking
dreams
are
mist
of
yearning
for
the
touch
of
you
to
marie
sukloff
an
assassin
in
your
lips
moving
fervently
your
eyes
hot
with
fire
life
seems
immortally
young
with
desire
life
seems
impetuous
hungrily
free
having
no
faith
but
its
burning
to
be
you
could
dance
laughingly
draw
where
you
move
hearts
hands
and
voices
pouring
you
love
youth
be
a
carnival
life
be
the
queen
you
could
go
dancing
and
singing
and
seen
whence
came
that
tenderness
cruel
and
wild
arming
with
murder
the
hand
of
a
child
whence
came
that
breaking
fire
nursed
and
caressed
with
passion
white
fingers
for
tyranny
breast
in
your
soul
sacredly
deeper
than
fear
burns
there
a
miracle
dreadful
to
hear
virgin
of
murder
was
it
god
breath
begetting
a
savior
that
filled
you
with
death
to
an
actress
you
walk
as
vivid
as
a
sunny
storm
across
the
drinking
meadows
through
the
eyes
of
stricken
men
with
light
and
fury
mingled
making
passionate
and
making
young
you
drive
the
mists
and
lift
the
drooping
heads
and
in
the
sultry
place
of
custom
raise
the
naked
colors
of
abounding
life
and
sound
the
crimson
windy
call
of
liberty
eyes
my
heart
is
sick
because
of
all
the
eyes
that
look
upon
you
drinkingly
they
almost
touch
you
with
their
fever
look
o
keep
your
beauty
like
a
mystic
gem
give
no
fibre
grain
of
hold
to
those
prehensile
amorous
bold
eyes
my
heart
is
sick
o
love
let
not
my
heart
corrupt
the
flower
of
your
liberty
go
spend
your
beauty
like
the
summer
sky
that
makes
a
radius
of
every
glance
and
with
your
morning
color
light
them
all
x
rays
your
eyes
were
in
that
dim
deep
chamber
hushed
and
sombre
with
imprisoned
fire
with
yellow
ghostly
globes
of
intense
æther
potent
as
the
rays
of
pure
desire
your
voice
was
startled
into
vivid
wonder
when
the
winged
wild
whining
mystic
wheel
took
flight
and
shot
the
dark
with
frosty
crashings
like
an
splitting
to
the
keel
your
flesh
was
never
warmer
to
my
passion
than
when
moving
in
that
lumor
green
we
saw
with
eyes
our
fragile
bones
enamoured
clasping
sadly
on
the
pallid
screen
you
seemed
so
virginal
and
so
undreaming
of
the
burning
hunger
in
my
eyes
to
peer
more
in
your
being
than
the
very
death
of
passion
lies
the
shy
motions
of
your
spirit
fashioned
through
the
ages
for
the
sun
were
dumb
in
that
green
cavern
where
you
walked
a
naked
skeleton
and
fluent
and
of
lovely
motion
living
to
the
tip
of
every
bone
and
ah
too
exquisitely
ever
to
lie
wanly
down
alone
to
lie
forever
down
so
still
and
slender
tracing
on
the
ancient
screen
of
night
that
naked
and
pale
writing
of
the
wonder
of
your
beauty
breathing
in
the
light
sonnets
a
preface
about
sonnets
although
so
complex
and
difficult
to
construct
the
sonnet
has
always
seemed
to
me
a
natural
and
almost
inevitable
form
whether
the
reason
lies
in
its
intrinsic
nature
or
in
the
tradition
that
surrounds
it
is
not
easy
to
tell
a
sonnet
is
almost
exactly
square
and
yet
it
has
a
division
sufficiently
off
the
centre
to
make
its
squareness
admirable
instead
of
tiresome
and
perhaps
this
simple
trait
together
with
its
closely
woven
structure
of
rhyme
is
what
gives
it
the
quiet
assurance
it
has
the
tranquil
rightness
of
a
thing
of
nature
or
natural
convenience
i
feel
towards
an
excellent
sonnet
as
i
imagine
an
eager
horse
may
feel
towards
a
good
measure
tightly
filled
up
with
golden
grain
this
feeling
is
due
partly
to
a
kind
of
honesty
of
which
the
squareness
of
a
sonnet
is
symbolic
it
is
a
form
in
which
poets
can
express
themselves
when
they
are
not
rhapsodically
excited
and
very
often
they
are
not
so
excited
and
at
such
times
if
they
write
rapid
lyrics
they
have
to
whip
themselves
up
with
an
emotion
that
they
get
out
of
the
writing
rather
than
out
of
the
facts
and
this
makes
much
lyric
poetry
seem
a
little
histrionic
whereas
in
order
to
create
a
sonnet
at
all
a
concentration
and
sustainment
of
feeling
is
required
that
is
inevitably
equal
to
its
more
temperate
pretensions
the
quality
of
being
inevitably
and
honestly
square
may
become
a
dreadful
thing
however
and
it
makes
this
form
inappropriate
for
persons
who
have
not
at
least
a
certain
degree
of
lyrical
taste
in
the
hands
of
such
persons
a
sonnet
is
not
a
poem
but
an
enterprise
they
get
inside
that
square
with
a
whole
lot
of
materials
colors
and
sounds
and
old
clothes
of
ideas
and
they
push
them
round
and
if
they
can
not
make
them
fill
in
properly
and
come
up
to
the
edges
they
climb
out
and
get
some
more
and
the
result
is
so
palpably
spreadout
an
object
always
with
lumps
of
imagery
here
and
there
that
it
can
not
even
be
received
in
the
linear
sequence
that
is
natural
to
the
eye
and
ear
this
fault
can
be
avoided
by
having
strongly
in
mind
while
composing
a
sonnet
the
virtues
not
specifically
its
own
the
clarity
the
running
and
pouring
in
single
stream
that
are
the
qualities
of
song
and
to
these
qualities
the
strict
convention
of
its
rhymes
and
the
traditional
relation
of
the
sonnet
parts
ought
to
give
way
when
there
is
a
conflict
between
them
for
if
a
poem
has
not
rhapsody
it
is
the
more
important
that
it
should
have
grace
at
least
that
is
my
opinion
and
i
offer
this
preface
in
expiatory
rather
than
boastful
vein
to
those
high
priests
of
perfection
who
guard
the
sonnet
as
a
kind
of
lonely
reliquary
of
their
god
a
praiseful
complaint
you
love
me
not
as
i
love
or
when
i
grow
listless
of
the
crimson
of
your
lips
and
turn
not
to
your
burning
you
would
show
fierce
and
feverish
your
eye
and
hotly
my
numb
wilfulness
decry
holding
your
virtues
over
me
like
whips
and
stinging
with
the
visible
eclipse
of
that
sweet
poise
of
life
i
crucify
how
can
you
pass
so
proudly
from
my
face
with
all
the
tendrils
of
your
passion
furled
so
adequate
and
animal
in
grace
as
one
whose
mate
is
only
all
the
world
i
never
taste
the
sweet
exceeding
thought
that
you
might
love
me
though
i
loved
you
not
those
you
dined
with
they
would
have
made
you
like
a
pageant
bold
and
nightly
festive
for
them
and
round
your
beauty
like
a
dusky
gem
have
poured
the
glamour
of
the
pride
of
gold
and
you
would
lie
in
life
as
in
her
bed
the
mistress
of
a
pale
king
indolent
though
hot
her
limbs
and
strong
her
languishment
and
her
deep
spirit
is
unvisited
but
i
would
see
you
like
a
gypsy
free
as
windy
morning
in
the
sunny
air
your
wild
warm
self
your
vivid
self
to
be
a
miracle
of
nature
liberty
giving
your
gift
of
being
kind
and
fair
high
gay
and
everywhere
the
passions
of
a
child
the
passions
of
a
child
attend
his
dreams
he
lives
loves
hopes
remembers
is
forlorn
for
legendary
creatures
whom
he
deems
not
too
unreal
until
one
golden
morn
the
gracious
sun
shines
in
upon
his
tranquil
pillow
and
his
eyes
are
touched
and
opened
greatly
and
begin
to
drink
reality
with
rich
surprise
i
loved
the
impetuous
souls
of
ancient
story
heroic
characters
kings
queens
whose
wills
like
empires
rose
achieved
and
fell
in
glory
i
was
a
child
until
the
radiant
dawn
thy
beauty
woke
me
o
thy
spirit
fills
the
stature
of
those
heroes
they
are
gone
as
the
crag
eagle
as
the
crag
eagle
to
the
zenith
height
wings
his
pursuit
in
his
exalted
hour
of
her
the
whose
airy
power
of
plume
and
passion
challenges
his
flight
to
that
wild
altitude
where
they
unite
in
mutual
tumultuous
victory
and
the
swift
sting
of
nature
ecstasy
their
shuddering
pinions
and
their
skyward
might
as
they
the
strong
to
the
full
height
of
heaven
bear
up
that
joy
which
to
the
strong
is
given
thus
thus
do
we
whose
stormy
spirits
quiver
in
the
bold
air
of
utter
liberty
clash
equal
at
our
highest
i
and
thee
unconquered
and
unconquering
forever
to
my
father
the
eastern
hill
hath
scarce
unveiled
his
head
and
the
deliberate
sky
hath
but
begun
to
meditate
upon
a
future
sun
when
thou
dost
rise
from
thy
impatient
bed
thy
morning
prayer
unto
the
stars
is
said
and
not
unlike
a
child
the
penance
done
of
sleep
thou
goest
to
thy
serious
fun
exuberant
yet
with
a
whisper
tread
and
when
that
lord
doth
to
the
world
appear
the
jovial
sun
he
leans
on
his
old
hill
and
levels
forth
to
thee
a
golden
smile
thee
in
his
garden
where
each
warming
year
thou
toilest
in
all
joy
with
him
to
fill
and
flood
the
soil
with
summer
for
a
while
to
edward
martin
from
a
professional
hobo
how
old
my
friend
is
that
pen
wherewith
in
smiling
quietude
you
trace
the
maiden
maxims
of
your

this
gripped
and
den
and
of
hunger
now
and
then
dip
out
with
nice
and
intellectual
grace
the
faultless
wisdoms
of
a
nurtured
race
of
pink
and
perfect
gentlemen
how
long
have
art
and
wit
and
poetry
with
all
their
power
been
content
like
you
to
gild
the
smiling
fineness
of
the
few
to
what
they
dare
not
see
in
multitudinous
reality
the
rough
and
bloody
soul
of
what
is
true
in
an
editorial

the

darkened
on

like
the
fear

in
happy
augury
we
dared
to
guess
that
her
pure

shot
one
sunny
glance
of
paganry
across
the

clear
startling
this
dim
fog
of
soulfulness
but
now
with
arms
and
carnage
and
the
cries

holy
murder
rolling
to
the
clouds
her
smoke

their
murky

of

horses

is
this
lovely
girl
of
summer
meadows
dancing
on
the
grass
so
young
and
tenderly
her
footsteps
pass
so
and
lightly
wild

warm
the
bugles
murmur
and

they
are
lost
and
vanished
like
a
storm
the
sun

autumn
and
that
sadness
as
of
love
heroic
in
immortal
solitude
those
veins
of
flaming
passion
through
the
wood
but
in
the
blue
and
infinite
above
a
shining
circle
like
the
light
of
truth
deathless
his
desire
sublime
whose
motion
is
the
measurement
of
time
whose
step
is
morning
and
his
smile
is
youth
no
passion
burns
upon
the
livid
earth
whose
stain
can
tint
that
circle
or
whose
cry
can
rout
the
tranquilly
receiving
sky
all
passion
all
its
crimson
stream
from
birth
to
murder
bloom
and
pestilential
blight
all
flows
beneath
the
sanction
of
his
light
the
net
the
net
brings
up
how
long
and
languidly
a
million
vivid
quiverings
of
life
and
gleaming
like
a
steely
knife
all
colors
green
and
silver
of
the
sea
all
forms
of
skill
and
eagerness
to
be
they
die
and
wither
of
the
very
breath
that
sounds
your
pity
of
their
lavish
death
while
they
are
leaping
to
be
free
they
die
and
wither
but
the
agéd
sea
insane
old
salty
womb
of
mystery
is
pregnant
with
a
million
million
more
whom
she
will
suckle
in
her
oozy
floor
whom
she
will
vomit
on
a
heedless
shore
while

her
immortal
currents
pour
a

sonnet
i
was
so
lonely
on
the
dunes
the
shadow
of
a
bird
passed
the
sand
and
i
a
driftwood
relic
in
my
hand
sea
winds
are
not
more
lonely
when
they
stray
a
little
fitful
and
bewildered
way
in
this
wan
acre
whose
dry
billows
stand
so
pitilessly
still
of
curve
so
bland
and
wide
and
waiting
infinitely
grey
in
hollows
i
could
almost
hear
them
say
the
misty
breezes
run
we
will
not
stay
in
this
unreal
and
spiritual
land
our
soul
of
life
is
calling
from
the
strand
whose
blue
and
breathing
bosom
leapt
or
lay
or
laughed
to
us
in
shots
of
silver
spray
songs
the
wind
blows
in
along
the
sea
its
salty
wet
caresses
impart
to
all
the
ships
that
be
a
thrill
before
it
passes
the
tide
is
never
at
a
stand
a
mountain
in
its
motion
forever
homing
to
the
land
and
ever
to
the
ocean
and
on
its
fickle
mighty
breast
the
waters
still
are
moving
with
love
in
every
running
crest
and
laughter
in
the
loving
light
love
to
touch
the
prows
of
ships
that
slip
along
so
slenderly
i
would
as
lightly
touch
your
lips
and
your
heart
as
tenderly
if
you
would
move
with
all
that
move
the
flowing
and
caressing
who
have
no
firmness
in
their
love
no
sorrow
in
its
passing
rainy
song
down
the
dripping
pathway
dancing
through
the
rain
brown
eyes
of
beauty
laugh
to
me
again
eyes
full
of
starlight
moist
over
fire
full
of
young
wonder
touch
my
desire
o
like
a
brown
bird
like
a
bird
flight
run
through
the
rain
drops
lithely
and
light
body
like
a
gypsy
like
a
wild
queen
slim
brown
dress
to
slip
through
the
green
the
little
leaves
hold
you
as
soft
as
a
child
the
little
path
loves
you
the
path
that
runs
wild
who
would
not
love
you
seeing
you
move
and
beautiful
through
the
green
grove
let
the
rain
kiss
you
trickle
through
your
hair
laugh
if
my
fingers
mingle
with
it
there
laugh
if
my
cheek
too
is
misty
and
drips
wetness
is
tender
laugh
on
my
lips
the
happy
sweet
laughter
of
love
without
pain
young
love
the
strong
love
burning
in
the
rain
a
hymn
to
god
in
time
of
stress
lift
o
dark
and
glorious
wonder
once
again
thy
gleaming
sword
cleave
this
killing
doubt
asunder
with
one
sheer
and
sacred
word
for
my
heart
is
weak
and
broken
and
the
struggle
runs
too
high
and
there
is
no
burning
token
in
the
new
immortal
sky
oh
not
curb
or
courage
only
does
my
hour
demand
of
me
it
is
thought
supreme
and
lonely
and
responsible
and
free
and
i
quail
before
the
danger
as
a
bark
before
the
blast
when
the
beacon

a

in
the

piling

the
diogenes
a
hut
and
a
tree
and
a
hill
for
me
and
a
piece
of
a
weedy
meadow
i
ask
no
thing
of
god
or
king
but
to
clear
away
his
shadow
earlier
poems
earlier
poems
a
preface
about
their
philosophy
most
of
the
friends
who
read
the
volume
from
which
these
poems
are
selected
wanted
to
ask
me
what
i
meant
by
one
of
the
titles
the
thought
of
protagoras
and
i
meant
so
much
i
meant
to
convey
in
that
phrase
the
hue
of
the
philosophic
background
upon
which
the
colors
of
my
life
are
drawn
that
since
i
failed
i
venture
to
enlarge
its
meaning
here
with
a
word
of
confession
an
attitude
that
might
be
called
affirmative
scepticism
is
native
to
my
mind
and
underlies
every
impulse
that
i
have
to
portray
the
universal
character
of
life
and
truth
we
seek
among
all
our
experiences
for
some
absolute
and
steadfast
value
by
which
or
toward
which
we
may
guide
ourselves
but
there
is
no
absolute
value
except
life
itself
the
having
of
experiences
and
among
all
our
opinions
we
seek
for
an
objective
and
eternal
truth
but
nothing
is
eternally
true
except
the
variety
of
opinions
intermittently
throughout
the
whole
history
of
western
and
i
suppose
of
eastern
thought
this
mood
has
arisen
it
was
the
mood
of
protagoras
and
of
that
protagorean
vein
in
plato
which
is
the
height
of
ancient
wisdom
it
arose
again
after
a
period
of
investigation
and
formulation
of
isms
in
sextus
empiricus
and
the
little
group
of
alexandrian
scientists
the
last
light
to
go
out
in
the
darkness
of
the
reign
of
saints
and
theologies
again
after
those
ages
of
sombre
and
oppressive
faith
under
the
roof
of
the
cathedral
it
appeared
in
the
great
montaigne
the
writings
of
montaigne
arrive
in
history
with
a
bold
and
tranquil
flavor
of
delight
in
free
meditation
as
though
the
too
world
had
at
last
made
up
its
mind
to
escape
from
church
and
go
fishing
it
is
a
reverent
sabbath
holiday
in
human
thought
almost
immediately
however
the
insane
passion
of
belief
recurs
descartes
attempt
at
a
surgery
of
doubt
is
only
the
pathetic
opening
of
space
for
new
and
enormous
growths
of
the
old
substance
spinoza
follows
him
the
man
and
leibnitz
and
other
monumental
believers
and
then
david
hume
quietly
prepares
and
once
more
offers
to
mankind
in
his
clear
humble
and
noble
enquiry
about
human
understanding
the
sceptic
wisdom
the
moral
equilibrium
that
would
save
its
health
and
reason
but
kant
and
hegel
and
those
mountainous
germans
the
giants
of
overwhelming
again
with
their
rationalizations
of
primitive
egotism
send
all
the
world
to
the
of
metaphysical
conviction
and
from
this
we
are
now
again
issuing
awakened
for
the
fifth
time
and
today
the
awakener
is
no
individual
the
awakener
is
science
empirical
science
turning
its
brave
eyes
upon
man
its
maker
to
reveal
the
origin
and
destroy
the
excessive
pretensions
of
his
thoughts
and
so
once
again
the
sanity
of
the
world
has
been
saved
or
so
at
least
it
seems
to
one
whose
intellectual
home
is
in
these
ages
of
sacred
doubt
thoughts
that
are
abstract
logically
are
psychologically
concrete
things
general
ideas
are
specific
occurrences
they
are
occurrences
in
an
individual
mind
reflecting
perhaps
a
material
disturbance
in
a
brain
and
these
things
and
occurrences
can
in
the
conception
of
science
be
explained
as
the
result
of
antecedent
causes
they
which
are
the
sovereign
instruments
of
explanation
can
themselves
become
the
subject
of
explanation
and
therein
lose
their
impersonality
and
their
universality
which
was
their
truth
such
i
think
is
the
modern
counterpart
of
the
thought
of
protagoras
summarized
for
the
ancients
in
his
famous
saying
that
man
is
the
measure
of
all
things
this
thought
used
to
come
to
my
mind
strongly
in
a
seminar
at
columbia
university
where
in
a
shadowy
corner
of
the
great
library
at
sunset
we
gathered
to
read
and
study
the
writing
of
spinoza
our
teacher
was
a
scholar
of
philosophy
with
the
rarest
gift
of
sinking
himself
emotionally
as
well
as
with
intellect
into
the
metaphysical
system
of
the
philosopher
he
studied
he
is
not
the
one
i
have
portrayed
in
my
poem
that
is
a
product
of
my
imagination
but
he
seemed
always
so
ingenuous
to
me
in
his
acceptance
of
the
existence
of
realities
corresponding
to
the
vast
abstractions
of
that
philosopher
of
eternity
that
i
could
not
but
see
continually
in
my
fancy
demons
of
time
and
the
concrete
conspiring
against
him
among
the
alleys
of
the
and
there
came
the
thought
of
death
walking
straight
into
that
chamber
to
annihilate
the
event
of
the
individual
idea
the
only
actual
thing
denoted
for
me
by
his
words
of
portentous
and
import
in
my
poem
i
tried
to
make
such
a
death
portray
and
prove
to
the
imagination
the
thought
of
protagoras
in
another
poem
leif
ericson
i
made
the
same
reflection
a
theme
of
joy
and
a
kind
of
pagan
sermon
of
life
the
voyage
of
that
wonderful
sailor
out
over
the
challenging
blue
without
knowledge
and
without
sanction
of
ends
is
a
symbol
of
the
adventure
of
individual
being
it
is
an
example
to
our
hearts
so
fond
of
faith
and
prudence
so
little
filled
by
nature
with
moral
courage
and
abandon
at
the
aquarium
serene
the
silver
fishes
glide
and
pale
and
as
through
the
agéd
deeps
of
ocean
they
glide
with
wan
and
wavy
motion
they
have
no
pathway
where
they
go
they
flow
like
water
to
and
fro
they
watch
with
never
winking
eyes
they
watch
with
staring
cold
surprise
the
level
people
in
the
air
the
people
peering
peering
there
who
wander
also
to
and
fro
and
know
not
why
or
where
they
go
yet
have
a
wonder
in
their
eyes
sometimes
a
pale
and
cold
surprise
earth
night
sombre
sombre
is
the
night
the
stars
light
is
dimmed
with
smoky
exhalations
of
the
earth
whose
ancient
voice
is
lifted
on
the
wind
in
ceaseless
elegies
and
songs
of
tears
o
earth
i
hear
thee
mourning
for
thy
dead
thou
art
waving
the
long
grass
over
thy
graves
murmuring
over
all
thy
resting
children
that
have
run
and
wandered
and
gone
down
upon
thy
bosom
thou
wilt
mourn
for
him
who
looketh
now
a
moment
on
these
stars
and
in
the
moving
boughs
of
this
dark
night
heareth
the
murmurous
sorrow
of
thy
heart
the
thought
of
protagoras
my
memory
holds
a
tragic
hour
to
prove
or
paint
with
bleeding
stroke
the
ancient
thought
that
will
to
sorrow
move
all
minds
forever
all
that
love
to
know
it
was
the
hour
when
lamps
wink
yellow
in
the
winter
twilight
and
the
hurriers
go
home
to
rest
and
we
whose
task
was
meditation
rose
and
wound
a
murmuring
way
among
the
books
and
effigies
the
fading
fragrance
of
a
vaulted
library
a
place
to
me
most
like
a
dim
vast
cavernous
brain
that
holds
all
the
world
hath
of
musty
memory
in
sombre
convolutions
that
are
dying
there
at
our
faithful
table
every
day
in
the
great
shadow
of
this
dissolution
we
would
speak
of
things
eternal
things
divine
that
change
not
and
we
spoke
with
one
who
was
a
leader
of
the
way
to
them
a
man
born
regal
to
the
realms
of
thought
high
pale
and
sculptural
his
brow
and
high
his
concourse
with
the
kings
of
old
plato
and
aristotle
and
the
jew
the
bold
mild
jew
who
in
his
pensive
chamber
fell
in
love
with
god
it
was
of
him
and
that
unhungering
love
of
his
he
told
us
and
with
soft
and
stately
melody
the
scholar
eloquence
he
lifted
us
sublime
above
the
very
motions
of
our
mortal
being
and
we
walked
with
him
the
heights
of
meditation
like
the
gods
i
have
no
memory
surpassing
this
and
yet
strange
pity
of
our
natures
or
of
his
there
ran
a
rumor
poisonous
scandal
breeds
her
brood
in
the
house
of
prayer
and
we
to
whom
these
were
like
hours
of
prayer
we
whispered
things
not
all
philosophy
when
he
was
gone
we
knew
but
little
where
he
went
or
whence
he
came
but
this
we
knew
that
there
was
other
love
in
him
than
what
he
taught
us
love
that
makes
more
quickly
pale
ay
even
he
was
tortured
with
the
lure
of
mortal
motion
in
the
eyes
and
lips
and
limbs
that
were
not
warm
to
him
alone
were
warm
to
him
he
drank
mortality
dim
care
the
ghost
of
retribution
sat
in
pallor
on
his
brow
and
made
us
whisper
in
the
shadow
of
our
meditations
faintly
faintly
did
we
feel
the
hour
advancing
livid
painting
of
a
thought
he
spoke
of
substance
strangely
on
that
day
eternal
infinite
he
seemed
i
thought
to
rest
upon
the
name
and
as
he
spoke
there
came
on
me
that
trance
of
inattention
when
the
words
would
seem
to
drop
their
magic
of
containing
things
and
by
a
shift
become
but
things
themselves
mere
partial
motions
of
the
flesh
of
lips
i
watched
these
motions
watched
them
blandly
till
i
knew
i
watched
them
and
that
roused
me
and
i
heard
him
saying
things
and
moving
things
are
merely
modes
of
but
one
attribute
of
what
is
infinite
in
attributes
and
may
be
called
he
spoke
to
there
and
then
his
pencil
the
thin
pencil
dropped
a
crack
behind
us
a
quick
step
among
the
books
his
hand
his
head
his
body
all
collapsed
and
fell
or
settled
utterly
before
the
fact
came
on
us
he
was
shot
and
killed
but
little
i
remember
after
that
what
matters
it
the
deed
the
quick
red
deed
was
done
and
all
his
speculations
vanished
like
a
sound
to
the
ascending
moon
rise
rise
aerial
creature
fill
the
sky
with
supreme
wonder
and
the
bleak
earth
wash
with
mystery
pale
pale
enchantress
steer
thy
flight
high
up
into
the
purple
blue
where
faint
the
stars
beholding
rain
from
there
thy
lucent
influence
upon
this
sphere
i
fear
thee
sacred
mother
of
the
mad
with
thy
deliberate
magic
thou
of
old
didst
soothe
the
perplexed
brains
of
idiots
whipped
and
scared
and
lacerated
for
their
cure
ay
thou
didst
spread
the
balm
of
sleep
on
them
give
to
their
minds
a
curvéd
emptiness
of
silence
like
the
heaven
thou
dwellest
in
yet
didst
thou
also
with
thy
rayless
light
make
mad
the
surest
draw
from
their
smooth
beds
the
very
sons
of
prudence
maniacs
to
wander
forth
among
the
bushes
howl
abroad
like
eager
wolves
and
snatch
the
air
oft
didst
thou
watch
them
prowl
among
the
tombs
inviolate
of
the
patient
dead
toiling
in
deeds
obscure
with
stealthy
ecstasy
and
thou
didst
palely
peer
among
them
and
expressly
shine
into
their
unhinged
eyes
i
fear
thee
languid
mother
of
the
mad
for
thou
hast
still
thy
alien
influence
thou
dost
sow
forth
thro
all
the
fields
and
hills
and
in
all
chambers
of
the
natural
earth
a
difference
most
strange
and
luminous
this
tree
that
was
the
river
sycamore
is
in
thy
pensive
effluence
become
but
the
mind
mystic
essence
of
a
tree
upright
luxuriance
thought
upon
the
stream
is
liquid
timeless
motion
undefined
the
world
a
gesture
dim
like
rapturous
thought
which
can
the
rigorous
concrete
obscure
unto
annihilation
and
create
upon
the
dark
a
universal
vision
thou
even
on
this
bold
and
local
earth
the
site
of
the
obtruding
actual
thou
dost
erect
in
awful
purity
the
filmy
architecture
of
all
dreams
and
they
are
perfect
thou
dost
shed
like
light
perfection
and
a
vision

ethereal

leif

through
the

northward
and

i
descry
thee
o

thy
deed
like
the
dive
of
a
star
doth
startle
the
ages
of
darkness
through
which
it
is
hurled
doth
flash

thee

what
continent
soundeth
thy
name
what
people
thy
praise
who
sendeth
the
signal
of
gratitude
back
to
the
days
when
thou
in
thy
boat
didst
put
forth
from
the
world
and
defy
infinity
ignorance
tempest
and
ocean
and
sky
no
history
brags
not
of
god
nor
doth
history
brag
of
thee
sailor
who
carried
thy
sail
and
thy
flag
clear
over
his
seas
drove
into
his
mystery
old
the
prow
of
thy
skerry
whose
quivering
hold
could
dip
but
a
cupful
out
of
his
watery
wrath
that
stormed
thee
and
snatched
at
thy
bowsprit
and
licked
up
thy
path
when
mythical
rumor
ran
over
the
earth
with
the
whisper
of
lands
that
were
dreamed
of
beyond
the
red
birth
of
the
the
blood
of
thy
body
took
running
fire
to
launch
and
be
swift
the
sea
as
a

desire
o
rare
is
the
northern
morning
that
shineth
for
thee
a
million
silvering
crests
on
the
cold
blue
sea
and
the
wind
drives
in
from
the
jubilant
sea
to
the
land
and
catching
thy
laughter
it
tosses
the
cloak
in
thy
hand
as
taunting
thee
forth
to
thy
sails
in
the
frosty
air
where
thousands
surround
thee
with
awe
and
a
wondering
prayer
and
they
that
stand
with
thee
they
stand
they
bend
at
thy
word
i
hear
the
boat
sing
on
the
sand
and
they
slip
to
their
oars
as
the
boat
leaps
aloft
on
a
wave
with
thee
at
the
windy
helm
joyful
and
joyfully
brave
the
depth
of
the
billows
is
awful
the
depth
of
the
sky
is
silent
as
god
silent
the
dark
on
high
naught
sings
to
thy
heart
save
thy
heart
and
the
wind
the
wild
giant
of
ocean
agrin
in
the
darkness
who
rattles
defiant
a
laugh
through
thy
rigging
and
howls
from
the
clouds
at
thee
and
moans
in
a
mimic
of
pain
and
a
murmurous
glee
still
stern
i
behold
thee
thy
stature
dim
through
the
dark
unmoved
unreleasing
the
helm
of
thy
bark
o
god
of
our
fathers
give
signs
to
our
eyes
give
sight
to
thy
sailors
give
but
the
sun
to
arise
in
the
morn
on
an
island
pale
in
the
haze
of
the
west
o
beam
of
the
star
in
the
north
is
thy
only
behest
to
gesture
me
onward
eternally
unto
no
shore
of
these
high
and
wild
waters
famed
for
their
hunger
of
yore
then
give
to
thy
sailor
for
life
the
courage
of
death
to
encounter
the
taunt
of
this
wind
with
a
rougher
breath
of
gigantic
contempt
in
the
soul
for
where
and
when
so
it
be
onward
impetuous
living
onward
again
he
saileth
safe
who
carrieth
death
on
board
he
flieth
a
laughing
sail
in
the
wrath
of
the
lord
so
sang
thy
heart
to
thy
heart
and
so
to
the
swinging
sea
in
a
lull
of
the
wind
the
song
of
a
spirit
free
serene
adventurer
lover
of
distance
divine
pursuing
thy
love
forever
though
never
thine
o
king
with
thy
blue
eyes
over
the
sea
who
dares
to
sing
and
live
the
praise
of
thee
not
they
that
safe
in
a
haven
of
certainty
steer
from
mooring
to
mooring
with
faith
and
with
fear
and
pray
for
a
map
of
the
universe
pointer
and
plan
when
all
the
blue
waves
of
the
ocean
the
courage
of
man
challenge
to
venture
not
they

the
praisers
of

midnight

thinly
in

deepness
of
the
gloom
truth
rises
out
of
a
tomb
and
we
are
dumb

and
we
still

round

day
returns

and

wanly
down
into

grave

sweet
throat
has
stirred
a
million
in

that
curl
and
circle
everywhere
they
break
not

at
my
ear
but
quiver
far
within
warm
days
are
near
to
the
flowers
at
church
soft
little
daughters
of
the
mead
the
random
bush
the
wanton
weed
that
lived
to
love
and
loved
to
breed
who
hither
bound
you
you
innocent
of
all
the
screed
that
blows
around
you
sweet
daffodils
so
laughing
yellow
beneath
a
bending
you
need
not
try
to
gulp
and
swallow
the
apostles
creed
or
shudder
at
the
fates
that
follow
adam
deed
big
bloody
hymns
the
choir
sings
and
blows
it
to
the
king
of
kings
the
while
you
dream
of
humble
things
that
wander
there
where
first
you
spread
your
golden
wings
on
summer
air
like
jesus
simple
and
divine
in
beauty
not
in
raiment
fine
who
asked
no
high
or
holier
shrine
in
which
to
pray
than
garden
groves
of
palestine
olives
gray
his
name
i
think
would
still
be
bright
though
churches
were
unbuilded
quite
and
they
whose
hearts
are
toward
the
height
should
simple
be
and
lift
their
heads
into
the
light
as
straight
as
ye
to
the
little
bed
at
night
little
bed
with
your
patient
white
pillow
your
light
little
spread
and
your
blanket
of
yellow
i
wonder
what
leaves
you
so
pensive
the
breezes
are
tender
the
stars
are
so
bright
i
should
think
you
would
wrinkle
a
little
and
smile
and
be
happy
to
think
we
can
sleep
for
a
while
are
you
waiting
for
something
or
are
you
just
seeming
to
listen
so
breathlessly
hushed
as
though
dreaming
a
form
that
is
fresher
than
breezes
so
light
a
coming
more
precious
than
stars
to
the
night
who
shall
mould
you
as
soft
as
the
breast
of
a
billow
and
crown
with
all
beauty
your
patient
white
pillow
little
bed
are
you
lonely
so
late
we
will
lie
down
together
together
we
wait
in
a
dungeon
of
russia
a
cell
leading
to
the
gallows
a
noble
lady
who
is
an
assassin
a
common
murderer
the
chilling
gray
a
ghost
of
mortal
dawn
has
touched
them
and
they
know
the
hour
the
guard
shifts
guiltily
his
shoes
upon
the
stone
they
raise
their
eyes
in
languid
terror
but
the
moment
passes
and
is
still
again
save
in
some
piteous
way
she
moves
her
throat
there
is
a
wandering
of
her
burning
eyes
until
they
fix
and
strangely
stare
upon
the
face
of
her
companion
they
would
plead
against
the
heavy
horror
of
his
look
for
not
an
idiot
corpse
could
strike
the
soul
more
sick
with
wonder
o
look
up
and
speak
to
me
her
voice
is
startling
to
the
walls
speak
any
word
against
this
gloom
he
moves
a
eye
but
answers
not
tell
if
was
cold
and
filthy
where
you
lay
ay
filthy
cold
was
cold
enough
to
keep
the
carrion
from
rotting
on
these
bones
they
never
kill
us
never
we
hang
he
spoke
a
brutal
tongue
against
the
gloom
and
there
was
heard
far
off
a
step
a
voice
the
guard
stood
up
a
quiver
moved
her
limbs
give
me
some
simple
word
give
me
your
hand
in
comradeship
we
die
together
and
the
while
we
breathe
we
are
each
other
world
no
not
your
world
my
lady
though
we
die
i
have
no
grace
to
give
a
hand
to
you
my
hand
is
thick
and
dirty
yours
is
pale
you
say
lady
in
the
very
tomb
will
even
death
not
laugh
this
weakness
off
your
tongue
to
think
nobility
abides
this
hour
lady
o
it
is
a
curse
that
whips
me
at
the
grave
i
was
not
born
can
i
not
even
die
a
human
soul
yes
you
can
die
and
better
you
can
kill
is
not
your
ladyship
the
gallows
rope
snaps
that
to
nothing
death
not
death
alone
can
laugh
at
your
nobility
i
laugh
no
not
your
piteous
ladyship
that
dies
it
is
your
crime
that
daunts
me
that
shall
live
to
plant
with
this
fine
delicate
little
hand
small
heavy
death
into
the
very
heart
of
tyranny
that
lives
the
future
is
all
life
for
you
for
me
a
glassy
look
a
yell
into
the
air
and
i
am
gone
no
life
springs
up
from
me
i
am
the
dirt
that
drank
the
drippings
of
a
guilty
murder
that
is
why
i
sit
like
sickness
here
and
goad
you
with
my
shame
i
take
your
hand
i
tell
you
i
was
starved
wrecked
shattered
to
the
bones
with
drunken
hunger
and
i
killed
for
gold
i
tell
you
this
your
crime
shall
live
to
blot
the
memory
of
mine
and
me
and
all
the
insane
tribe
of
us
who
having
strength
in
poverty
will
not
lie
down
and
starve
blot
off
the
world
our
having
been
the
crime
of
our
killed
hopes
and
gradual
infamy
the
fever
gleam
was
in
his
eyes
the
future
there
it
burned
a
moment
while
he
stood
to
see
the
door
swing
darkly
open
and
the
guard
salute
she
stood
beside
him
and
together
in
high
union
of
their
fainting
hearts
they
faced
the
hour
that
brought
them
to
their
level
graves
march
to
a
tawny
thrush
pine
spirit
breath
and
voice
of
a
wild
glade
in
the
wild
forest
near
it
in
the
cool
hemlock
or
the
leafy
limb
whereunder
thou
didst
run
and
wander
thro
the
sun
and
shade
an
elvish
echo
and
a
shadow
dim
there
in
the
twilight
thou
dost
lift
thy
song
and
give
the
stilly
woods
a
silver
tongue
out
of
what
liquid
is
thy
laughing
made
a
sister
of
the
water
thou
dost
seem
the
quivering
cataract
thou
singest
near
whose
glistening
stream
unto
the
listening
ear
thou
dost
outrun
with
thy
cascade
of
music
beautiful
and
swift
and
clear
a
joy
unto
the
mournful
forest
given
as
when
afar
a
travelling
star
across
our
midnight
races
a
moving
gleam
that
quickly
ceases
lost
in
the
blue
black
abyss
of
heaven
so
doth
thy
light
and
silver
singing
start
and
thrill
the
silence
round
thy
piney
hill
unto
the
sober
hour
a
jewel
bringing
a
mystery
a
strain
of
rhythm
fleeing
a
vagrant
echo
winging
back
to
the
unuttered
theme
of
being
the
saint
gaudens
statues
poet
thy
dreams
are
grateful
to
the
air
and
the
light
loves
them
tho
they
murmur
not
their
carven
stillness
is
a
music
rare
and
like
the
song
of
one
whose
tongue
hath
caught
the
clear
ethereal
essence
of
his
thought
i
hear
the
talkers
come
the
changing
throngs
that
with
the
fashions
of
a
day
surround
thy
visions
and
i
hear
them
quell
their
tongues
and
hush
their
querulous
shoes
upon
the
ground
thy
dreams
are
with
the
crown
of
silence
crowned
though
they
feel
not
the
glowing
diadem
who
sleep
for
aye
in
their
cool
shapes
of
stone
nor
ever
will
the
sunlight
waken
them
nor
ever
will
they
turn
their
eyes
and
moan
to
think
that
their
brief
poet
life
is
gone
the
tender
and
the
lofty
soul
is
gone
who
eyed
them
forth
from
darkness
and
confessed
his
spirit
motion
in
unmoving
stone
his
praise
upon
no
mortal
tongue
doth
rest
by
these
unwhispering
lips
it
is
expressed
soon
will
the
ample
arms
of
night
withdraw
her
shuffling
children
from
the
twilit
hall
from
that
heroic
presence
in
dim
awe
of
whom
the
dark
withholds
a
while
her
pall
and
leaves
him
luminous
above
them
all
then
are
ye
lost
in
darkness
and
alone
ye
ghostly
spirits
and
the
moment
rare
doth
quicken
that
too
sad
and
nameless
stone
to
move
her
robe
and
spill
her
sable
hair
and
be
in
silence
mingled
with
the
air
for
she
is
one
with
the
dim
glimmering
hour
and
the
white
spirits
beautiful
and
still
and
the
veiled
memory
of
the
vanished
power
that
moulded
them
the
high
and
infinite
will
that
earth
begets
and
earth
does
not
fulfil
