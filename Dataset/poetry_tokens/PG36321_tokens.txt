the

has
helped
me
too
a
little
bit
in

i
can
not
fail
with
such
a

so
deep
a
passion
for
detail
and
such
meticulous
precision
i
pity
men
like
sidney

how
jealous
they
must
be
of
me
is
easy
work
to
be
exact
i
have
no
fear
of
contradiction
since
it
has
been
allowed
that
fact
is
stranger
far
than
any

what
demands

this

a

may

learn
without
undue

the
fruits
of

not

resemble

they
not

you
feel
the

grip
of

accomplished
as

autocratic
as
a

he

the

him
combined
we
critics
find
the
diplomatic
skill
of
choate

breadth

chauncey
fund

he
joins
the
morals
of

love

to

he
adds
the
charms
of
carrie
nation
in
him
we
see
a
devotee
of
what
is
called
the
simpler
life
to
tell
the
naked
truth
and
be
contented
with
a
single
wife
luxurious
living
he
abhors
and
takes
his
pleasures
out
of
doors
and
since
his
sole
delight
and
pride
are
exercise
and
open
air
his
spirit
chafes
at
being
tied
all
day
to
an
official
chair
the
in
the
room
beneath
can
hear
him
gnash
his
serried
teeth
in
summertime
he
ca
resist
a
country
gallop
on
his
cob
so
like
a
thorough
altruist
he
lets
another
do
his
job
in
winter
he
will
work
all
day
but
when
the
sun
shines
he
makes
hay
and
thus
in
spite
of
office
ties
he
manages
to
take
a
lot
of
healthy
outdoor
exercise
where
other
presidents
have
not
as
i
can
prove
by
drawing
your
attention
to
his

he
shoots
a
bear
at
he
schools
a
restive
horse
from
to
he
takes
the
air
he
does
take
it
all
of
course
and
then
at
maybe
some
colored
man
drops
in
to
tea
at
intervals
throughout
the
day
he
sprints
around
the
house
or
if
his
residence
is
oyster
bay
he
races
up
and
down
the
cliff
while
seagulls
scream
about
his
legs
or
hasten
home

he
shoots
a
a

is
he
who
never
stooped
to
roll
a
log
agile
as
fond
gazelle
or
flea
sagacious
as
an
indoor
dog
in
him
we
find
a
spacious
mind
uncribb
uncabin
unconfin
in
martial
exploits
he
delights
and
has
no
fear
of
war
alarms
the
hero
of
a
hundred
fights
since
first
he
was
a
child
in
arms
like
when
bugles
bray
he
champs
his
bit
and
tries
to
neigh
and
if
the
army
of
the
state
is
always
in
such
perfect
trim
and
up
to
date
this
grand
result
is
due
to
him
for
while
his
country
reaped
the
fruit
was
he
alone
could
reach
the
root
and
spite
of
jeers
that
foes
have
hurled
no
problems
can
his
soul
perplex
he
lectures
women
of
the
world
upon
the
duties
of
their
sex
and
with
unfailing
courage
thrusts
his
spoke
within
the
wheels
of
trusts
no
private
ends
has
he
to
serve
no
dirty
linen
needs

colossal

his

you
read
already
always

elizabethan
days
ho
by
my
halidome
gadzooks
lord
bacon
wrote
his
own
essays
and
lots
of
other
people
books
annexing
as
a
pseudonym
each
author
name
that
suited
him
all
notoriety
he
shirk
nor
sought
for
literary
credit
although
the
best
of
shakespeare
work
was
his
for
gallup
said
it
and
she
poor
lady
i
suppose
has
read
the
whole
of
it
and
knows
such
was
his
kind
unselfish
plan
that
he
allowed
a
rude
unshaven
actor
man
to
style
himself
the
bard
of
avon
altho
was
and
not
this
fellow
who
wrote
the
tempest
and
othello
for
right
throughout
his
works
there
is
a
cipher
hid
which
makes
it
certain
that
all
pope
iliad
is
his
and
the
anatomy
of
burton
there
not
a
volume
you
can
name
to
which
he
has
not
laid
a
claim
he
is
responsible
i
wot
for
euclid
lucid
demonstrations
the
early
works
of
walter
scott
and
the
aurelian
meditations
also
the
house
with
seven
gables
and
most
of
æsop
fables
and
once
when
he
annoyed
the
queen
and
wished
to
gain
the
royal
pardon
he
wrote
his
masterpiece
i
mean
that
work
about
her
german
garden
and
published
just
before
his
death
the
visits
of
elizabeth
yet
peradventure
we
are
wrong
for
just
as
probable
the
chance
is
that
all
these
volumes
may
belong
to
someone
else
and
not
to
francis
i
think
tho
i
may
be
mistaken
that
shakespeare
wrote
the
works
of
bacon
if
you
approach
the
mosque
of
fame
and
seek
to
climb
its
tallest
steeple
just
lodge
a
literary
claim
against
the
works
of
other
people
and
though
the
press
may
not
receive
it
a
few
old
ladies
will
believe
it
for
instance
i
of
proof
could
bring
sufficient
to
convince
the
layman
that
i
had
written
attributed
to
stanley
weyman
in
common
justice
i
should
pocket
the
royalties
of
crockett
and
anyone
can
plainly
see
without
the
wit
of
machiavelli
that
hall
caines
look
alike

me

the
luxuries
that
we
enjoy
he
never
had
so
never

appliances
that
we
employ
for

work
did
not
exist
he
would
have
found
them
useless
too
not
having
any
work
to

he
never
wrote
a

he
had
no
creditors
to
pay
he
was
not
pestered
for
his
vote
not
having
one
to
give
away
and
living
utterly
alone
he
did
not
need
a
telephone
the
joys
of
indolence
he
knew
in
his
remote
and
peaceful
clime
he
did
just
what
he
wanted
to
nor
ever
said
he
had
time
and
this
was
natural
becos
he
had
whatever
time
there
was
his
pulse
was
strong
his
health
was
good
he
had
no
fads
of
meat

no

when
he
went
to

he
made

gave

appeared
upon

soon
he
found
it
dull
i

so
thought
that

would
like
a

when
eve
appeared
upon

scene
and
we
will
draw
a
kindly
veil
over
the
sequel
to

ye

has
not

his
tragic
tale
who
does
not
know
and
how
he
put
his
life
to
stake
for
principle
and
country
sake
this
simple
person
of
lorraine
had
thoughts
for
nothing
but
romance
and
longed
to
see
a
king
again
upon
the
battered
throne
of
france
with
charles
the
seventh
crowned
at
rheims
he
realized
his
fondest
dreams
then
came
the
fight
at
compiègne
where
he
was
captured
by
the
foe
and
lots
of
vulgar
foreign
men
caught
hold
and
would
let
him
go
please
do
he
begged
them
in
despair
you
disarranging
all
my
hair
unmoved
by
grace
of
form
or

these
brutes

hearts
were

opaque

rude
poor
joan
of
arc
of
course
was
bound
to
be
the
centre
of
the
show
when
having
piled
the
faggots
round
they
lit
him
up
and
let
him
go
which
surely
strikes
the
modern
mind
as
thoughtless
not
to
say
unkind
but
tho
he
died
his
deathless
name
in
holds
a
noble
place
and
brings
the
blush
of
conscious
shame
to
any
face
perfidious
truly
was
the
nation
which
caused
his
premature
cremation
i
showed
these
verses
to
a
friend
inviting
him
to
criticise
he
read
them
slowly
to
the
end
then
asked
me
with
a
mild
surprise
what
was
your
object
he
began
in
making
joan
of
arc
a
man
i
hastened
to
the
library
which
kind
carnegie
gave
the
town
searched
section
b
biography
and
took
six
bulky
volumes
down
then
studied
all
one
livelong
night
and
found
alas
my
friend
was
right
i
sorry
for
it
gives
me
pain
to
think
of
such
a
waste
of
rhyme
i
write
the
poem
all
again
only
i
ca
afford
the
time
it
rather
late
to
change
it
now
i
ca
be
bothered
anyhow

than
he
who
fixes

his

the

upon
its

strong
men
snort
while
cuban
veterans
with
medals
grow
kind
of
and
soppy
and
journalists
forget
their
copy
and
as
he
makes
the
smart
or
softly
on
its
surface
lingers
he
plays
upon
the
public
heart
and
holds
it
there
beneath
his
fingers
caresses
teases
pokes
or
squeezes
does
just
exactly
as
he
pleases

oh

who

buy

surround
his
feet
in

and
try
to
waft
him
fat
damp
kisses

that

repays
them
well
to
note
the
tale
of
william
tell
he
was
a
patriotic
swiss
whose
skill
was
such
with
bow
and
arrow
he
never
had
been
known
to
miss
a
target
howsoever
narrow
his
archery
could
well
defy
the
needle
or
the
camel
eye
and
when
the
hated
austrian
invaded
his
belovéd
country
this
simple
man
at
once
began
to
treat
the
foe
with
calm
and
gave
a
sporting
exhibition
to
which
he
charged
ten
cents
admission
he
set
his
son
against
a
tree
upon
his
head
an
apple
placing
next
measured
paces
and
turned
about
his
offspring
facing
then
chose
an
arrow
drew
his
bow
and
all
the
people
murmured
oh
no
sound
disturbed
the
morning
air
you
could
have
heard
a
falling
save
in
the
virgin
forest
where
a
chipmunk
to
his
mate
was
calling
where
sang
the
giddy
martingale
or
snaffle
woo
the
genial
quail
but
drowning
cry
of
beast
or
bird
there
rose
the
hush
of
expectation
no
whispered
converse
not
a
word
from
the
surrounding
population
a
tactful
silence
as
of
death
while
people
held
each
other
breath
the
bow
rang
out
the
arrow
sped
before
a
man
could
turn
completely
all
scatheless
shone
the
offspring
head
the
apple
lay
divided
neatly
the
public
gave
a
roar
and
appleplectic
shrieked
they
kissed
the
hero
clasped
his
hand
in
search
of
autographs
pursued
him
escorted
with
the
local
band
cheered
banqueted
and
interviewed
him
demanding
how
he
shot
so
well
but
simple
william
would
not
tell
the
austrians
without
a
word
retired
at
once
across
the
border
and
thence
on
william
they
conferred
two
medals
and
a
foreign
order
and
tactfully
addressed
the
bill
hereditary
will
and
in
the
piping
times
of
peace
such
luxury
his
life
was
wrapt
in
he
got
the
of
police
and
made
his
son
a
precinct
captain
wore
celluloid
white
cuffs
and
collars
and
absolutely
rolled
in
dollars
still
to
the
end
whenever
will
with
fiscal
problems
had
to
grapple
he
called
to
mind
his
offspring
skill
at
balancing
the
homely
apple
and
made
him
use
his
level
head
at
balancing
accounts
instead
he
stopped
inside
a
tub
from
choice
but
otherwise
was
altho
he
raised
a
rasping
voice
to
persons
who
his
view
obstructed
and
threw
a
boot
at
anyone
who
robbed
him
of
his
patch
of
sun
and
thus
he
lived
without
expense
arrayed
in
somewhat
scant
apparel
his
customary
residence
the
limits
of
an
empty
barrel
his
spirits
would
perforce
be
good
maturing
slowly
in
the
wood
with
lamp
alight
he
sought
at
night
for
honest
men
his
ruling
passion
but
either
he
was
short
of
sight
or
honest
men
were
out
of
fashion
he
never
found
one
so
he
said
they
probably
were
all
in
bed
illustration
he
raised
a
rasping
voice
to
persons
who
his
view
at
last
when
he
was
very
old
he
got
abducted
by
a
pirate
and
to
a
man
of
corinth
sold
at
an
exorbitantly
high
rate
his
owner
called
him
sunny
jim
and
made
an
indoor
pet
of
him
and
soon
as
one
may
well
suppose
he
learnt
the
very
choicest
manners
could
balance
sugar
on
his
nose
or
sit
right
up
and
smoke
havanas
or
swim
into
the
pond
for
sticks
there
was
no
limit
to
his
tricks
he
never
tasted
wine
nor
meat
but
ate
in
full
and
plenteous
measure
and
force
and
shredded
wheat
pretending
that
they
gave
him
pleasure
at
length
at
he
died
of
a
too
strenuous
inside
had
but
this
worthy
cynic
been
a
member
of
favoured
nation
niagara
he
might
have
seen
and
realised
a
new
sensation
if
he
had
set
himself
the
task
to
brave
the
rapids
in
his
cask
or
if
his
ghost
once
more
began
with
lighted
lamp
his
ancient
mission
and
searched
the
city
for
a
man
whose
honesty
outsoared
suspicion
we
could
provide
him
in
new
york
a
nice
if
somewhat
lengthy
walk
tho
thumping
tubs
is
easy
work
with
which
no
critic
cares
to
quarrel
there
may
be
charms
about
a
turk
policemen
even
may
be
moral
and
tho
they
never
get
found
out
there
are
honest
men
about
thomas
of
all
the
sportsmen
now
afloat
upon
the
waters
of
this
planet
no
better
ever
manned
a
boat
or
paid
another
man
to
man
it
and
won
a
kindly
public
heart
like
dear
sir
thomas
lipton
bart
behind
a
counter
as
a
child
he
woo
dame
fortune
fair
but
fickle
until
at
last
one
day
she
smiled
upon
his
spices
and
his
pickle
and
all
the
world
rejoiced
to
see
plain
thomas
lipton
made
sir
tea
he
won
the
trade
his
name
was
made
in
or
london
gutter
all
classes
found
his
marmalade
a
perfect
substitute
for
butter
his
jam
in
loudest
praise
was
sung
his
sauces
were
on
tongue
he
built
a
yacht
that
is
to
say
he
paid
another
man
to
build
it
with
all
the
patents
of
the
day
regardless
of
the
cost
he
filled
it
and
hired
which
was
expensive
too
at
least
three
captains
and
a
crew
and
being
properly
brought
up
a
member
of
that
sober
nation
which
ever
loves
to
raise
the
cup
that
cheers
without
inebriation
he
saw
an
if
he
took
his
lifting
to
sandy
hook
and
there
his
hospitality
was
always
welcome
to
the
masses
as
on
the
good
ship
erin
he
provided
luncheons
for
all
classes
where
poets
publicans
and
peers
retained
his
spoons
as
souvenirs
but
tho
each
boat
of
his
that
sailed
was
like
the
last
one
only
better
to
lift
the
cup
she
always
failed
because
the
yankees
would
let
her
a
state
of
things
which
was
not
quite
what
englishmen
would
term
polite
his
efforts
were
alas
in
vain
he
could
beat
the
pot
defender
again
he
tried
and
yet
again
he
might
as
well
have
sailed
a
tender
at
last
he
cried
i
give
it
up
america
can
keep
her
cup
for
she
and
she
alone
has
got
the
proper
breed
of
modern
yachtsmen
if
only
had
hired
a
lot
of
swedes
norwegians
and
scotsmen
i
might
have
met
with
calm
defiance
the
crew
on
which
placed
reliance
but
as
the
matter
stands
instead
of
knowing
what
a
fight
is
i
fêted
dined
and
banqueted
until
i
get
appendicitis
and
probably
shall
end
my
life
by
marrying
a
yankee
wife
i
felt
it
when
the
line
was
crost
i
hold
it
true
befall
is
better
to
have
luffed
and
lost
than
never
to
have
luffed
at
all
my
shareholders
must
be
content
with
such
a
good
advertisement
it
is
impossible
to
do
three
kinds
of
things
at
once
a
fact
that
must
be
patent
to
the
of
the
dullest
dunce
yet
marat
somehow
never
knew
it
and
died
in
an
attempt
to
do
it
a
revolutionist
was
he
the
people
friend
they
called
him
so
and
many
such
there
used
to
be
in
france
a
hundred
years
ago
for
further
notice
see
carlyle
if
you
can
grapple
with
his
style
his
manners
were
so
debonnair
he
took
a
day
would
sit
and
write
his
letters
there
in
quite
an
unselfconscious
way
and
if
you
wished
to
interview
him
his
housekeeper
would
take
you
to
him
illustration
charlotte
corday
came
along
intent
to
right
her
country
but
charlotte
corday
came
along
a
norman
noble
nobler
daughter
intent
to
right
her
country
wrong
and
put
an
end
to
ceaseless
slaughter
in
marat
she
descried
a
victim
so
bought
a
knife
and
promptly
pricked
him
poor
marat
who
as
was
his
wont
was
planning
further
revolutions
the
while
he
washed
exclaimed
oh
do
you
interrupting
my
ablutions
i
ca
escape
it
is
fair
a
sponge
is
all
i
have
to
wear
but
charlotte
firmly
answered
bosh
how
could
she
so
forget
good
breeding
while
you
sit
there
and
calmly
wash
the
noblest
hearts
in
france
are
bleeding
then
jabbed
him
in
those
vital
places
where
ordinary
men
wear
braces
so
perished
marat
in
his
way
to
prove
a
lesson
apt
and
scathing
from
which
young
people
of
may
learn
the
dangers
of
mixed
bathing
and
shun
the
thankless
operation
of
sponging
on
a
rich
relation
ye
democrats
who
plan
and
plot
schemes
to
decapitate
your
betters
remember
that
a
bath
is
not
the
proper
place
for
writing
letters
nor
one
which
providence
intends
for
interviews
with
when
golf
was
in
its
childhood
still
and
not
the
sport
that
now
it
is
when
knew
of
bunker
hill
or
spoke
of
boston
one
man
there
was
who
played
the
game
and
ananias
was
his
name
but
little
else
of
him
we
know
save
that
his
grasp
of
facts
was
slack
and
yet
as
circumstances
show
he
was
a
golfomaniac
and
thus
biographers
relate
the
story
of
his
tragic
fate
he
occupied
his
final
scene
in
golfing
parlance
so
is
said
in
practising
upon
the
and
after
a
bad
lie
lay
dead
then
came
sapphira
she
poor
soul
after
a
worse
lie
halved
the
hole
the
portrait
that
i
seek
to
paint
is
of
no
ordinary
hero
no
customary
plaster
saint
for
nothing
of
the
sort
was
nero
he
was
an
emperor
but
then
he
had
his
faults
like
other
men
and
first
a
foolish
thing
to
do
he
turned
his
hand
to
matricide
and
straight
his
agéd
mother
slew
the
poor
old
lady
promptly
died
is
surely
wrong
to
kill
one
mother
since
one
can
hardly
get
another
he
was
a
hearty
feeder
too
and
onto
his
digestion
thrust
all
kinds
of
fatty
foods
and
grew
robust
with
accent
on
the
sweets
are
i
quote
from
memory
the
uses
of
obesity
he
married
twice
two
ladies
fair
agreed
in
turn
to
be
his
wife
to
board
his
slender
barque
and
share
his
fate
upon
the
stream
of
life
forgive
me
if
i
mention
this
as
being
true
canoebial
bliss
his
talent
on
the
violin
he
was
for
ever
proud
of
showing
the
tone
that
he
produced
was
thin
nor
could
one
loudly
praise
his
bowing
but
persons
whom
he
played
before
were
almost
sure
to
ask
for
more
for
he
decreed
that
any
who
did
not
encore
him
or
applaud
should
be
beheaded
cut
in
two
hanged
flayed
alive
and
sent
abroad
so
it
was
natural
that
they
who
came
to
cough
remained
to
pray
he
felt
no
sympathy
for
those
who
had
not
lots
to
drink
and
eat
who
wore
unfashionable
clothes
and
strove
to
make
the
two
ends
meet
they
drew
no
tears
the
short
and
ple
flannels
of
the
poor
from
him
to
christians
he
was
far
from
kind
they
met
with
his
disapprobation
the
choicest
tortures
he
designed
for
folks
of
their
denomination
and
all
historians
insist
that
he
was
no
philanthropist
to
he
would
oft
attach
a
jew
immersed
in
paraffine
apply
a
patent
safety
match
and
smile
as
he
surveyed
the
scene
was
possible
in
rome
at
night
to
read
a
book
by
israelight
and
when
occurred
the
famous
fire
of
which
some
say
he
was
the
starter
he
roused
the
corporation
ire
by
playing
braga
serenata
is
said
that
when
he
changed
to
handel
the
play
was
hardly
worth
the
scandal
a
he
crowned
his
long
career
at
last
by
one
supreme
and
final
action
which
after
such
a
lurid
past
gave
universal
satisfaction
and
not
one
poor
relation
cried
when
he
committed
suicide
the
feast
is
ended
as
we
seen
is
time
the
vacant
board
to
quit
by
vacant
bored
i
do
not
mean
my
host
of
readers
not
a
bit
for
they
the
mentally
élite
are
stimulated
and
replete
the
fare
that
i
provide
is
light
but
do
i
pray
look
down
upon
it
such
verse
is
just
as
hard
to
write
as
any
sentimental
sonnet
it
looks
a
simple
task
maybe
well
try
your
hand
at
it
and
see
do
fancy
too
that
i
dispense
with
study
or
eschew
research
sufficient
books
of
reference
i
have
to
fill
the
highest
church
i
no
dislike
of
work
i
swear
it
that
i
ca
bear
abuse
or
praise
me
as
you
choose
there
is
no
limit
to
my
patience
my
verse
the
daily
once
styled
mephitic
exhalations
i
lived
that
down
do
ask
me
how
and
nothing
really
hurts
me
now
for
while
my
stricken
soul
survived
with
wounded
pride
and
dulled
ambition
my
humble
book
of
verses
thrived
and
quite
outgrew
the
old
edition
so
now
i
have
exhaled
some
more
mephitically
as
before
the
book
is
finished
with
a
sigh
my
pen
upon
the
desk
i
lay
the
weary
task
is
and
i
am
off
upon
a
holiday
to
paris
lovely
paris
where
i
have
a
little
b
and
tho
my
verses
may
be
weak
and
call
for
your
severest
strictures
the
illustrations
are
unique
i
really
never
saw
such
pictures
at
times
in
my
unthinking
way
i
almost
hope
i
never
