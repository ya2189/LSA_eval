preface
poems
garnered
up
in
this
little
volume
were
written
at
different
periods
in
the
life
of
the
author
dating
from
her
early
girlhood
up
to
recent
years
they
were
not
written
with
a
view
of
making
a
book
each
poem
being
the
spontaneous
outpouring
of
a
deeply
poetic
nature
and
called
forth
by
some
experience
that
claimed
her
old
man
of
the
mountain
for
instance
was
written
while
the
author
was
contemplating
this
lofty
new
hampshire
crag
whose
rugged
outlines
resemble
the
profile
of
a
human
face
inspired
by
the
grandeur
of
this
masterpiece
of
nature
handiwork
and
looking
up
through
nature
unto
nature
god
the
poem
began
to
take
form
in
her
thought
and
alighting
from
her
carriage
she
seated
herself
by
the
roadside
and
began
to
write
some
tourists
who
were
passing
and
who
made
her
acquaintance
asked
her
what
she
was
writing
and
she
replied
by
reading
the
poem
to
them
they
were
so
pleased
with
it
that
each
requested
a
copy
which
was
subsequently
mailed
to
them
similar
requests
continued
to
reach
the
author
for
years
afterward
until
the
poem
finally
found
its
way
into
print
appearing
together
with
the
valley
cemetery
in
a
book
gems
for
you
published
in
manchester
in
and
again
in
boston
in
poem
on
the
dedication
of
a
temperance
hall
in
lynn
in
was
written
for
that
occasion
and
was
sung
by
the
audience
as
a
dedicatory
hymn
the
liberty
bells
appeared
in
a
lynn
newspaper
under
the
date
of
february
a
note
from
the
author
which
was
published
with
the
poem
read
as
follows
editor
a
mob
in
boston
although
boston
has
since
been
the
pioneer
of
dispersed
a
meeting
of
the
female
society
and
assailed
the
person
of
william
lloyd
garrison
with
such
fury
that
the
city
authorities
could
protect
him
nowhere
but
in
the
walls
of
a
jail
by
order
of
governor
andrew
the
bells
are
ringing
to
celebrate
the
passing
of
a
resolution
in
congress
prohibiting
slavery
in
the
united
states
of
the
author
hymns
are
included
in
this
collection
as
well
as
many
poems
written
in
girlhood
and
during
the
years
she
resided
in
lynn
and
which
appeared
in
various
publications
of
that
day
among
her
earliest
poems
are
upward
resolutions
for
the
day
autumn
written
in
a
maple
grove
alphabet
and
bayonet
and
the
written
while
visiting
a
family
friend
in
the
beautiful
suburbs
of
boston
yet
even
these
are
characterized
by
the
same
lofty
trend
of
thought
that
reached
its
fulness
in
her
later
may
eddy
requested
her
publisher
to
prepare
a
few
bound
volumes
of
her
poems
for
private
distribution
when
this
became
known
to
her
friends
they
urged
her
to
allow
a
popular
edition
to
be
issued
to
which
she
assented
with
grateful
acknowledgment
therefore
of
this
permission
this
little
volume
is
presented
to
the
public
in
the
hope
that
these
gems
of
purest
thought
from
this
author
will
prove
a
joy
to
the
heavy
laden

ye
rose
a
monument

proud
from

ah
who
can
fathom
thee
ambitious
man
like
a
trained
falcon
in
the
gallic
van
guided
and
led
can
never
reach
to
thee
with
all
the
strength
of
weakness
vanity
great
as
thou
art
and
paralleled
by
none
admired
by
all
still
art
thou
drear
and
lone
the
moon
looks
down
upon
thine
exiled
height
the
stars
so
cold
so
glitteringly
bright
on
wings
of
morning
gladly
flit
away
yield
to
the
sun
more
genial
mighty
ray
the
white
waves
kiss
the
murmuring
rill
but
thy
deep
silence
is
unbroken
still
when
starlight
blends
with
morning
hue
i
miss
thee
as
the
flower
the
dew
when
noonday
shadows
flee
i
think
of
thee
i
think
of
thee
with
evening
memories
reappear
i
watch
thy
chair
and
wish
thee
here
till
sleep
sets
drooping
fancy
free
to
dream
of
thee
to
dream
of
thee
since
first
we
met
in
weal
or
woe
it
hath
been
thus
and
must
be
so
till
bursting
bonds
our
spirits
part
and
love
divine
doth
fill
my
heart
written
many
years
ago
evening
o
gentle
presence
peace
and
joy
and
power
o
life
divine
that
owns
each
waiting
hour
thou
love
that
guards
the
nestling
faltering
flight
keep
thou
my
child
on
upward
wing
tonight
love
is
our
refuge
only
with
mine
eye
can
i
behold
the
snare
the
pit
the
fall
his
habitation
high
is
here
and
nigh
his
arm
encircles
me
and
mine
and
all
o
make
me
glad
for
every
scalding
tear
for
hope
deferred
ingratitude
disdain
wait
and
love
more
for
every
hate
and
fear
no
ill
since
god
is
good
and
loss
is
gain
beneath
the
shadow
of
his
mighty
wing
in
that
sweet
secret
of
the
narrow
way
seeking
and
finding
with
the
angels
sing
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
watch
and
pray
no
snare
no
fowler
pestilence
or
pain
no
night
drops
down
upon
the
troubled
breast
when
heaven
aftersmile
earth
gain
and
mother
finds
her
home
and
rest
brood
us
with
thy
wing
which
our
spirits
blend
like
brother
birds
that
soar
and
sing
and
on
the
same
branch
bend
the
arrow
that
doth
wound
the
dove
darts
not
from
those
who
watch
and
love
if
thou
the
bending
reed
wouldst
break
by
thought
or
word
unkind
pray
that
his
spirit
you
partake
who
loved
and
healed
mankind
seek
holy
thoughts
and
heavenly
strain
that
make
men
one
in
love
remain
learn
too
that
wisdom
rod
is
given
for
faith
to
kiss
and
know
that
greetings
glorious
from
high
heaven
whence
joys
supernal
flow
come
from
that
love
divinely
near
which
chastens
pride
and
fear
through
god
who
gave
that
word
of
might
which
swelled
creation
lay
let
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
what
chased
the
clouds
away
was
love
whose
finger
traced
aloud
a
bow
of
promise
on
the
cloud
thou
to
whose
power
our
hope
we
give
free
us
from
human
strife
fed
by
thy
love
divine
we
live
for
love
alone
is
life
and
life
most
sweet
as
heart
to
heart
speaks
kindly
when
we
meet
and
part
sitting
i
sitting
alone
where
the
shadows
fall
in
somber
groups
at
the
where
of
night
seek
the
loving
rose
her
bosom
to
fill
with
mortal
woes
i
waiting
alone
for
the
bridal
hour
of
nymph
and
naiad
from
woodland
bower
till
vestal
pearls
that
on
leaflets
lay
ravished
with
beauty
the
eye
of
day
i
watching
alone
the
starlit
glow
the
moon
and
ocean
flow
and
sketching
in
light
the
heaven
of
my
youth
its
starry
hopes
and
its
waves
of
truth
i
dreaming
alone
of
its
changeful
sky
what
rainbows
of
rapture
floated
by
of
a
mother
love
that
no
words
could
speak
when
parting
the
ringlets
to
kiss
my
cheek
i
thinking
alone
of
a
fair
young
bride
the
light
of
a
home
of
love
and
pride
how
the
glance
of
her
husband
watchful
eye
turned
to
his
star
of
idolatry
i
picturing
alone
a
glad
young
face
upturned
to
his
mother
in
playful
grace
and
the
unsealed
fountains
of
grief
and
joy
that
gushed
at
the
birth
of
that
beautiful
boy
i
weeping
alone
that
the
vision
is
fled
the
leaves
all
faded
the
fruitage
shed
and
wishing
this
earth
more
gifts
from
above

reason
made
right
and
hearts

my

harpstrings
of
the

there
sweeps
a
strain
low
sad
and
sweet
whose
measures
bind
the
power
of
pain
and
wake
a
angel
throng
of
thoughts
illumed
by
faith

breathed
in
raptured
song
with
love
perfumed

his

to
me
and
tenderly

me
on
the

which
the
winds
and
waves
can
shock
oh
nevermore
from
tired
joy
and
grief
afar
and
nearer

where
thine
own
children
are
i
love
to
be
my
prayer
some
daily
good
to
do
to
thine
for
thee

offering
pure
of
love
whereto

hillside

how
to
gather
how

to
feed
thy
sheep
i
will
listen
for
thy
voice
lest
my
footsteps
stray
i
will
follow
and

the
rugged
way

stubborn

when

grows
dark
and
cold

or
triumph

lead
thy
lambkins
to
the
fold
take
them
in
thine
arms
feed

hungry

morning
beam
white
as

ye
echoing
moans
from
the
footsteps
of
time
break
not
on
the
silence
unless
thou
canst
bear
a
message
from
heaven
no
partings
are
there
here
gloom
hath
enchantment
in
beauty
array
and
whispering
voices
are
calling
away
their
wooings
are
soft
as
the
vision
more
vain

would

in
their
empire
or
die
in
their
chain
here
smileth
the
blossom

sunshine
not

flowers
fresh
as
the
pang

bosom

bled

outliveth

grave

not
quench

thou
gentle
cypress
in
evergreen
tears

winter
appears
my
heart
hath
thy
verdure

blossoms
above
like
thee
it
endureth
and
liveth
in
love
ambition
come
hither
these
vaults
will
unfold
the
sequel
of
power
of
glory
or
gold
then
rush
into
life
and
roll
on
with
its
tide
and
bustle
and
toil
for
its
pomp
and
its
pride
the
tired
wings
flitting
through
far
crimson
glow
which
steepeth
the
trees
when
the
is
low
the
voice
of
the
must
here
send
a
thrill
to
the
heart
of
the
leaves
when
the
winds
are
all
still
graves
do
i
hear
the
glad
voices
that
swell
and
call
to
my
spirit
with
seraphs
to
dwell
they
come
with
a
breath
from
the
verdant
springtime
and
waken
my
joy
as
in
earliest
prime
blest
beings
departed
ye
echoes
at
dawn
o
tell
of
their
radiant
home
and
its
morn
then
i
think
of
its
glory
and
rest
till
i
see
my
loved
ones
in
glory
still
waiting
for
me
i
watched
in
the
azure
the
eagle
proud
wing
his
soaring
majestic
and
feathersome
fling
careening
in
liberty
higher
and
higher
like
genius
unfolding
a
quenchless
desire
would
a
tear
dim
his
eye
or
pinion
lose
power
to
gaze
on
the
lark
in
her
emerald
bower
when
higher
he
soareth
to
compass
his
rest
what
vision
so
bright
as
the
dream
in
his
breast
god
eye
is
upon
him
he
penciled
his
path
whose
omniscient
notice
the
frail
fledgling
hath
though
lightnings
be
lurid
and
earthquakes
may
shock
he
rides
on
the
whirlwind
or
rests
on
the
rock
my
course
like
the
eagle
oh
still
be
it
high
celestial
the
breezes
that
waft
its

i
am
not
alone
when
onward
and
upward
and
heavenward
borne
written

years

on
the
mountain
oh
mountain
monarch
at
whose
feet
i
stand

to
adorn
thy
brow

clasp
thy

nature
divine
in
harmony
profound
with

high
place

earth
asleep

and
from
thy
lofty
summit
pouring
down
thy
sheltering
shade
her
noonday
glories
crown
thy
mission
mountain
sentinel
to
my
lone
heart
thou
art
a
power
and
spell
a
lesson
grave
of
life
that
teacheth
me
to
love
the
hebrew
figure
of
a
tree
faithful
and
patient
be
my
life
as
thine
as
strong
to
wrestle
with
the
storms
of
time
as
deeply
rooted
in
a
soil
of
love
as
grandly
rising
to

his
word
to
fold
an
angel

hover

from
on

such

laws
to
obey
as
reason
with
appetite

deny
that
health
may
my

kneel
at

that
pardon

through
his

seek

from

all
that
is

with
ambition
that
binds
us
to
earth
to
kindly
pass
over
a
wound
or
a
foe
and
but
part
us
awhile
to
breathe
forth
a
prayer
that
his
love
i
may
know
whose
mercies
my
sorrows
beguile
if
these
resolutions
are
acted
up
to
and
faith
spreads
her
pinions
abroad

i
ponder
the
days
may
be
few
that
waft
me
away
to
my
god
written
in

for
thy
wings
sweet
bird
o
for
thy
wings
sweet
bird
and
soul
of
melody
by
being
blest
like
thee
my
voice
had
stirred
some
dear
remembrance
in
a
weary
breast
but
whither
wouldst
thou
rove
bird
of
the
airy
wing
and
fold
thy
plumes
in
what
dark
leafy
grove
wouldst
chant
thy
vespers
rich
glooms
or
sing
thy
note
in
deeper
solitude
where
nymph
or
saint
has
wooed
some
mystic
spot
divinely
desolate
the
shrine
to
paint
yet
wherefore
ask
thy
doom
blessed
compared
with
me
thou
art
unto
thy
greenwood
home
bearing
no
bitter
memory
at
heart
wearing
no
earthly
chain
thou
canst
in
azure
bright
soar
far
above
nor
pinest
thou
in
vain
joys
departed
unforgotten
love
o
take
me
to
thy
bower
beguile
the
lagging
hours
of
weariness
with
strain
which
hath
strange
power
to
make
me
love
thee
as
i
love
life
less
from
mortal
consciousness
which
binds
to
earth
infirmity
of
woe
or
pining
tenderness
whose
streams
will
never
dry
or
cease
to
flow
an
aching
voiceless
void
hushed
in
the
heart
whereunto
none
reply
and
in
the
cringing
crowd
companionless
bird
bear
me
through
the
sky
written
more
than
sixty
years
ago
for
the
hampshire
come
in
the
minstrel
lay
when
two
hearts
meet
and
true
hearts
greet
and
all
is
morn
and
may
come
thou
and
now
anew
to
thought
and
deed
give
sober
speed
thy
will
to
know
and
do
stay
till
the
storms
are
the
cold
blasts
done
the
reign
of
heaven
begun
and
love
the
evermore
be
patient
waiting
heart
light
love
divine
is
here
and
thine
you
therefore
can
not
part
the
seasons
come
and
go
love
like
the
sea
rolls
on
with
thee
but
knows
no
ebb
and
flow
faith
hope
and
tears
triune
above
the
sod
find
peace
in
god
and
one
eternal
noon
oh
thou
hast
heard
my
prayer
and
i
am
blest
this
is
thy
high
behest
thou
here
and
and
to
the
editor
of
the
lynn
mass
i
hope
the
heart
that
hungry
for
things
above
the
floor
will
find
within
its
portals
an
item
rich
in
store
that
melancholy
mortals
will
count
their
mercies
and
learn
that
truth
and
wisdom
have
many
items
more
that
when
a
wrong
is
done
us
it
stirs
no
thought
of
strife
and
love
becomes
the
substance
as
item
of
our
life
that
every
ragged
urchin
with
bare
feet
soiled
or
sore
share
god
most
tender
mercies
find
items
at
our
door
then
if
we
done
to
others
some
good
told
before
when
angels
shall
repeat
it
be
an
item
more
of
a
temperance
author
of
all
divine
gifts
lofty
pure
and
free
temperance
and
truth
in
song
sublime
an
offering
bring
to
thee
a
temple
whose
high
dome
rose
from
a
and
from
its
altar
to
thy
throne
may
we
press
on
and
up
and
she
last
at
the
cross
first
at
the
tomb
who
waits
woman

watch
to
cleanse
from
dross
the
cause
she
elevates
sons
of
the
old
bay
state
work
for
our
glorious
cause
and
be
your
waiting
hearts
elate

makes
your

of

you

soft

where
the
weary
and
lay
down
their
woes
when
the
fountain
and
leaflet
are
frozen
and
sere
and
the
mountains
more
friendless
their
home
is
not
here
when
the
herd
had
forsaken
and
left
them
to
stray
from
the
green
sunny
slopes
of
the
woodland
away
where
the
music
of
waters
had
fled
to
the
sea
and
this
life
but
one
given
to
suffer
and
be
was
it
then
thou
didst
call
them
to
banish
all
pain
and
the
harpstring
just
breaking
reecho
again
to
a
strain
of
enchantment
that
flowed
as
the
wave
where
they
waited
to
welcome
the
murmur
it
gave
oh
there
never
a
shadow
where
sunshine
is
not
and
never
the
sunshine
without
a
dark
spot
yet
there
one
will
be

loosens
the
fetters
of
pride

of

it
comes
through
our
tears
as
the
soft
summer
rain
to
beautify
bless
and
make
joyful
again
the
harp
of
the
minstrel
the
treasure
of

a
rainbow
of
rapture

the
mandate
that

thy
rosebud

of
winter
angry
storm

changeful
showers
its
leaves
have
shed
or
bowed
the
stem
but
gracefully
it
stands
a
gem
in
beauty
diadem
unplucked
by
ruthless
hands
thus
may
it
ripen
into
bloom
fresh
as
the
fragrant
sod
and
yield
its
beauty
and
perfume
an
offering
pure
to
god
sweet
as
the
poetry
of
heaven
bright
as
her
evening
star
be
all
thy
life
in
music
given
while
beauty
fills
each
bar
lynn
are
the
dear
days
ever
coming
again
as
sweetly
they
came
of
yore
singing
the
olden
and
dainty
refrain
oh
ever
and
nevermore
ever
to
gladness
and
never
to
tears
ever
the
gross
world
above
never
to
toiling
and
never
to
fears
ever
to
truth
and
to
love

the
forever
of
happiness
be
outside

again
chief
the
charm
of
thy
reflecting
is
the
moral
that
it
brings
nature
with
the

connecting
gives
the
artist
fancy
wings
soul
sublime
human
paints
the
limner
work
i
ween
art
and

all
unweary
lighting
up
this
mortal
dream
work
within
the
misty
mine
of
human
thoughts
we
see
soon
abandoned
when
the
master
crowns
life
cliff
for
such
as
we
students
wise
he
maketh
now
thus
those
who
fish
in
waters
deep
when
the
buried
master
hails
us
from
the
shores
afar
complete
art
hath
bathed
this
in
a
beauty
strong
and
meek
as
the
rock
whose
upward
tending
points
the
plane
of
power
to
seek
isle
of
beauty
thou
art
teaching
lessons
long
and
grand
tonight
to
my
heart
that
would
be
bleaching
to
thy
whiteness
cliff
of
wight
come
to
thy
bowers
sweet
spring
and
paint
the
gray
stark
trees
the
bud
the
leaf
and
wing
bring
with
thee
brush
and
breeze
and
soft
thy
shading
lay
on
vale
and
woodland
deep
with
sunshine
lovely
ray
light
the
rugged
steep
more
softly
warm
and
weave
the
patient
timid
grass
till
heard
at
silvery
eve
poor
robin
lonely
mass
bid
faithful
swallows
come
and
build
their
cozy
nests
where
wind
nor
storm
can
numb
their
downy
little
breasts
come
at
the
sad
heart
call
to
empty
summer
bowers
where
still
and
dead
are
all
the
vernal
songs
and
flowers
it
may
be
months
or
years
since
joyous
spring
was
there
o
come
to
clouds
and
tears
with
light
and
song
and
prayer
whence
are
thy
wooings
gentle
june
thou
hast
a
naiad
charm
thy
breezes
scent
the
rose
breath
old
time
gives
thee
her
palm
the
lark
shrill
song
doth
wake
the
dawn
the
forest
flute
gives
back
some
maiden
melody
too
pure
for
aught
so
mute
the
world
of
flowers
enraptured
by
thy
spell
looks
love
unto
the
laughing
hours
through
woodland
grove
and
dell
and
soft
thy
footstep
falls
upon
the
verdant
grass
it
weaves
to
melting
murmurs
ye
have
stirred
the
timid
trembling
leaves
when
sunshine
beautifies
the
shower
as
smiles
through
teardrops
seen
ask
of
its
june
the
heart
what
hath
the
record
been
and
thou
wilt
find
that
harmonies
in
which
the
soul
hath
part
perish
young
like
things
of
earth
in
records
of
the
heart
the
flowers
of
june
the
gates
of
memory
unbar
the
flowers
of
june
such
harmonies
retune
i
fain
would
keep
the
gates
ajar
so
full
of
sweet
enchantment
are
the
flowers
of
june
who
loves
not
june
is
out
of
tune
with
love
and
god
the
rose
his
rival
reigns
the
stars
reject
his
pains
his
home
the
clod
and
yet
i
trow
when
sweet
doth
play
a
part
the
curtain
drops
on
june
veiled
is
the
modest
moon
hushed
is
the
heart
quickly
earth
jewels
disappear
the
turf
whereon
i
tread
ere
autumn
blanch
another
year
may
rest
above
my
head
touched
by
the
finger
of
decay
is
every
earthly
love
for
joy
to
shun
my
weary
way
is
registered
above
the
languid
brooklets
yield
their
sighs
a
requiem
the
tomb
of
sunny
days
and
cloudless
skies
enhancing
autumn
gloom
the
wild
winds
mutter
howl
and
moan
to
scare
my
woodland
walk
and
frightened
fancy
flees
to
roam
where
ghosts
and
goblins
stalk
the
cricket
sharp
discordant
scream
fills
mortal
sense
with
dread
more
sorrowful
it
scarce
could
seem
it
voices
beauty
fled
yet
here
upon
this
faded
sod
o
happy
hours
and
fleet
when
songsters
matin
hymns
to
god
are
poured
in
strains
so
sweet
my
heart
unbidden
joins
rehearse
i
hope
it
better
made
when
mingling
with
the
universe
beneath
the
maple
shade
written
in
girlhood
in
a
maple
grove
and
if
fancy
plumes
aerial
flight
go
fix
thy
restless
mind
on
learning
lore
and
wisdom
might
and
live
to
bless
mankind
the
sword
is
sheathed
is
freedom
hour
no
despot
bears
misrule
where
knowledge
plants
the
foot
of
power
in
our
free
school
forth
from
this
fount
the
streamlets
flow
that
widen
in
their
course
hero
and
sage
arise
to
show
science
the
mighty
source
and
laud
the
land
whose
talents
rock
the
cradle
of
her
power
and
wreaths
are
twined
round
plymouth
rock
from
erudition
bower
farther
than
feet
of
chamois
fall
free
as
the
generous
air
strains
nobler
far
than
clarion
call
wake
freedom
welcome
where
minerva
silver
sandals
still
are
loosed
and
not
effete
where
echoes
still
my
thrill
woke
by
her
fancied
feet
wild
spirit
of
song
midst
the
zephyrs
at
play
in
bowers
of
beauty
i
bend
to
thy
lay
and
woo
while
i
worship
in
deep
sylvan
spot
the
muses
soft
echoes
to
kindle
the
grot
wake
chords
of
my
lyre
with
musical
kiss
to
vibrate
and
tremble
with
accents
of
bliss
here
morning
peers
out
from
her
crimson
repose
on
proud
prairie
queen
and
the
modest
and
vesper
reclines
when
the
dewdrop
is
shed
on
the
heart
of
the
pink
in
its
odorous
bed
but
flora
has
stolen
the
rainbow
and
sky
to
sprinkle
the
flowers
with
exquisite
dye
here
hickory
rears
his
bold
form
and
bares
a
brave
breast
to
the
lightning
and
storm
while
palm
bay
and
laurel
in
classical
glee
chase
tulip
magnolia
and
fragrant
and
sturdy
for
centuries
hath
given
its
feathery
blossom
and
branches
to
heaven
here
is
life
here
is
youth
here
the
poet
cool
waters
at
play
with
the
fish
while
cactus
a
mellower
glory
receives
from
light
colored
softly
by
blossom
and
leaves
and
nestling
alder
is
whispering
low
in
lap
of
the
with
musical
flow
dark
sentinel
hedgerow
is
guarding
repose
midst
grotto
and
songlet
and
streamlet
that
flows
where
beauty
and
perfume
from
buds
burst
away
and
ope
their
closed
cells
to
the
bright
laughing
day
yet
dwellers
in
eden
earth
yields
you
her
tear
oft
plucked
for
the
banquet
but
laid
on
the
bier
earth
beauty
and
glory
delude
as
the
shrine
or
fount
of
real
joy
and
of
visions
divine
but
hope
as
the
eaglet
that
spurneth
the
sod
may
soar
above
matter
to
fasten
on
god
and
freely
adore
all
his
spirit
hath
made
where
rapture
and
radiance
and
glory
fade
oh
give
me
the
spot
where
affection
may
dwell
in
sacred
communion
with
home
magic
spell
where
flowers
of
feeling
are
fragrant
and
fair
and
those
we
most
love
find
a
happiness
rare
but
clouds
are
a
presage
they
darken
my
lay
this
life
is
a
shadow
and
hastens
away
an
alder
growing
from
the
bent
branch
of
a
me
that
song
sing
me
that
song
my
spirit
is
sad
life
pulses
move
fitful
and
slow
a
meeting
with
loved
ones
in
dreams
i
have
had
whose
robes
were
as
spotless
as
snow
a
phantom
of
joy
it
fled
with
the
light
and
left
but
a
parting
in
air
my
soul
is
enchained
to
life
dreary
night
o
sing
me
sweet
hour
of
prayer
ah
sleep
twin
sister
of
death
and
of
night
my
thoughts
thy
still
lie
alas
that
from
dreams
so
boundless
and
bright
we
waken
to
life
dreary
sigh
those
moments
most
sweet
are
fleetest
alway
for
love
claspeth
earth
raptures
not
long
till
darkness
and
death
like
mist
melt
away
to
rise
to
a
seraph
new
song
ocean
or
alps
the
stranger
who
roams
but
gathers
a
wreath
for
his
bier
for
life
hath
its
music
in
low
minor
tones
and
is
the
cause
of
its
tear
but
drops
of
pure
nectar
our
brimming
cup
fill
when
we
walk
by
that
murmuring
stream
or
when
like
the
thrill
of
that
mountain
rill
your
songs
float
in
memory
dream
sweet
spirit
of
love
at
soft
eventide
wake
gently
the
chords
of
her
lyre
and
whisper
of
one
who
sat
by
her
side
to
join
with
the
neighboring
choir
and
tell
how
that
heart
is
silent
and
sad
no
melody
sweeps
its
strings
is
breaking
alone
but
a
young
heart
and
glad
might
cheer
it
perchance
when
she
sings
lynn
on
visiting
pine
grove
ah
why
should
the
brief
bliss
of
life
little
day
grow
cold
in
this
spot
as
the
spiritless
clay
and
thought
be
at
work
with
the
hours
and
tears
be
bedewing
these
flowers
ah
wherefore
the
memory
of
dear
ones
deemed
dead
should
bow
thee
as
winds
bow
the
tall
willow
head
beside
you
they
walk
while
you
weep
and
but
pass
from
your
sight
as
the
shade
the
dark
wavy
grass
the
cypress
may
mourn
with
her
evergreen
tears
and
like
the
blue
hyacinth
change
not
with
years
yea
flowers
of
feeling
may
blossom
above
to
yield
earth
the
fragrance
of
goodness
and
love
so
one
heart
is
left
me
she
breathes
in
my
ear
i
living
to
bless
thee
for
this
are
we
here
and
when
this
sweet
pledge
to
my
lone
heart
was
given
earth
held
but
this
joy
or
this
happiness
heaven
here
the
rock
and
the
sea
and
the
tall
waving
pine
enchant
deep
the
senses
subduing
sublime
yet
stronger
than
these
is
the
spell
that
hath
power
to
sweep
the
heartstrings
in
memory
hour
of
the
past
is
the
talisman
when
three
when
the
star
of
our
friendship
arose
not
to
set
and
pure
as
its
rising
and
bright
as
the

its

lay
a
bright

golden
shower
at
sunset
radiant
hour
like
to
the

glad
immortality
making
this

divine
making
its
